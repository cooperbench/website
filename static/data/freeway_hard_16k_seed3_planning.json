        "thinking": "<think>We are starting at (0,0) at turn t1 = 0, and we need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position y is updated as:\n  U: y = y + 1 (if not at 9)\n  D: y = y - 1 (if not at 0)\n  S: y remains\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway k (meaning y_T = k) and at that turn T, there is a car on freeway k such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the span of that car at turn T.\n\nNote: When the player moves, at the turn T when they are moving, they are only on the starting row during the entire turn. So if at turn T the player is at row y_T and moves to y_{T+1}, then during turn T they are only on row y_T. Therefore, they only check for collision on row y_T at turn T.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1 (which is 0). The cars are on freeways 1 to 8. Each freeway may have multiple cars.\n\nWe need to compute the position of the cars at any future turn T (where T>=t1). Since the cars move at constant speed and in a fixed direction, we can compute their spans at any turn.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t0 = 0. Then at a future turn T (>=0), the car that was at (h, tau, d, s) at turn 0 will have:\n\nIf direction is 'right' (which we assume means moving to the right, so increasing x), then:\n  head(T) = h + s * (T - 0) = h + s*T\n  tail(T) = tau + s * T   [but note: in the right-moving car, the span at time 0 was [tau, h] with tau <= h? Actually the table says for right: (head, tail) and then the span is [tau, h] meaning from tail to head? But in the update rule for right: \n      Span(T) = [tau + s*T, h + s*T]\n\nSimilarly, for left: \n      Span(T) = [h - s*T, tau - s*T]\n\nBut note: the initial representation for left: head and tail? The example for left: (48,83,left,36) -> then at time0: [h, tau] = [48,83]? But then the update rule says for left: [h - s*T, tau - s*T]. However, the initial state for left says: head=-48? Actually the table:\n\nLet me list the cars:\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48) -> but direction is right? Then the initial span should be [tail, head] = [-95, -48]? But the update rule for right: [tau + s*T, h + s*T]. So at T=0: [ -95, -48]. Then at time T: [-95+48T, -48+48T]\n\nBut wait, the problem says for a right-moving car: \n    initial: [tau, h] -> then at T: [tau + s*T, h + s*T]\n\nSo in the table, the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). But note the description: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\". \n\nFor a right-moving car, the head is the front (right end) and tail is the left end? So the initial span is [tail, head] = [tau, h]. Similarly, for left-moving, the head is the front (left end) and tail the right end? Then the initial span is [head, tail] = [h, tau]? But the update rule for left says: [h - s*T, tau - s*T]. \n\nHowever, the problem states for left-moving: \n    initial: [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*T, tau - s*T]\n\nBut note that if the car is moving left, then the entire car is moving left, so the head (which is the front) is at h and the tail at tau, and h < tau? Because if it's moving left, the head is the leftmost? \n\nBut in the example: freeway 4 and 5: (48,83,left,36). So h=48, tau=83. Then the initial span is [48,83]. Then at time T: [48-36T, 83-36T]. \n\nSimilarly, for a right-moving car: freeway 1: (-48,-95,right,48). Then initial span: [ -95, -48]? But the update rule: [tau + s*T, h + s*T] -> [-95+48T, -48+48T]. \n\nNow, the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is at freeway k (so y_T = k) and at that turn T, there is a car on freeway k such that the player's x=0 is in the car's span at time T.\n\nSo we must avoid being on a freeway k at turn T when 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe are to find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves the player from y=0 to y=9 in minimal turns without any collision.\n\nWe start at turn0: position (0,0). Note: at turn0, we are at freeway0? But the freeways that have cars are 1 to 8. So freeway0 is safe? Actually the grid has y=0,1,...,9. The freeways with cars are y=1,...,8. So y=0 and y=9 are safe (no cars). But note the goal is (0,9). So we start at (0,0) and need to get to (0,9).\n\nAt each turn, we can move up, down, or stay. We cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe need to avoid the freeways 1 to 8 at the exact turn when we are on them if there is a car covering x=0.\n\nWe can plan a path that might wait (by using S) to avoid a car.\n\nSince we want minimal turns, we prefer moving up as much as possible, but we must avoid the cars.\n\nLet me compute the positions of the cars at future times. We are only concerned with when they cover x=0.\n\nFor each freeway k, and for each car on that freeway, we can compute the set of turns T (relative to t0=0) for which the car's span at time T includes 0.\n\nBut note: we are at freeway k at turn T only if we are on that row at that turn.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k and for each time T, whether there is a car on freeway k at time T such that 0 is in its span.\n\nBut time T can be large? However, we are going to move from 0 to 9, and we can only move one step at a time. The minimal number of turns to go from 0 to 9 without any obstacles is 9 moves (all U). But we might have to wait or detour.\n\nWe can use a BFS over the state (turn, y) to find the minimal steps to reach y=9. The state: (t, y) where t is the turn count (starting at 0) and y is the row. We start at (0,0) and want to reach any (t,9). Then we output the actions.\n\nHowever, note that the car positions change with time, so the safety of a state (t,y) depends on t.\n\nBut note: the car movements are deterministic and linear. So for each freeway k and each car, we can compute the set of times T when 0 is covered by that car.\n\nWe can precompute a function safe(t, k) for k in {1,...,8} and t>=0: safe(t,k) = False if at time t, there is a car on freeway k that covers 0, else True. And note: if k=0 or k=9, then no car -> always safe.\n\nBut note: we are not on a freeway k if we are at k=0 or k=9? Actually the problem says freeways y=1,...,8 have cars. So k=0 and k=9 are safe.\n\nSo we can define:\n\nFor k=0 and k=9: safe(t,k) = True for all t.\n\nFor k=1 to 8: safe(t,k) = True only if at time t, no car on freeway k has span containing 0.\n\nNow, we need to compute for each freeway k and each car on it, the times t when the car covers 0.\n\nFor a car on freeway k (which we don't need to know k for the car's movement? Actually the freeway k is fixed for the car, and we are only concerned when we are on that freeway at the same time the car covers 0).\n\nSo for each car, we compute the time interval (if any) during which 0 is in its span.\n\nCar representation: (head, tail, direction, speed) at time0.\n\nCase 1: Right-moving (d='right')\n  Span at time t: [tau + s*t, h + s*t]\n  We require: tau + s*t <= 0 <= h + s*t\n\n  => t >= (0 - h) / s   and t >= (0 - tau) / s? Actually:\n      lower bound: tau + s*t <= 0  -> t <= (0 - tau) / s   [if s>0, then inequality direction]\n      upper bound: 0 <= h + s*t -> t >= ceil((0 - h) / s)   [if s>0]\n\n  But note: since the car is moving right, the entire span is moving right. The condition is:\n      tau + s*t <= 0 <= h + s*t\n\n  Rearranged:\n      t >= (0 - h) / s   and t <= (0 - tau) / s\n\n  However, note: for a right-moving car, we have head h and tail tau, and typically h > tau? Because the head is the front? In the example: freeway1: (-48, -95, right, 48). Then h=-48, tau=-95. Then:\n      t >= (0 - (-48)) / 48 = 48/48 = 1\n      t <= (0 - (-95)) / 48 = 95/48 ≈ 1.97\n\n  So t must be integer: t=1? Because t=1: \n      lower: -95+48*1 = -47, upper: -48+48=0 -> so 0 is at the upper bound? \n      The span at t=1: [-47, 0] -> so 0 is included? Yes.\n\n  At t=2: [-95+96=1, -48+96=48] -> 0 not included.\n\n  So the condition is: t_min = ceil( (0 - h) / s ) and t_max = floor( (0 - tau) / s )? But note: \n      We require: tau + s*t <= 0 -> t <= (0 - tau)/s\n      and h + s*t >= 0 -> t >= (0 - h)/s\n\n  So the integer t must satisfy: \n      t >= ceil( (0 - h) / s )   [if (0-h)/s is not integer, then ceil; if negative, then note we are looking for t>=0?]\n      t <= floor( (0 - tau) / s )\n\n  But also note: if the car is moving right, then as t increases, the car moves to the right. So the interval of t for which the car covers 0 is [ceil((0-h)/s), floor((0-tau)/s)].\n\n  However, let me check the example: \n      h=-48, tau=-95, s=48.\n      (0 - h) = 48 -> 48/48=1 -> ceil(1)=1.\n      (0 - tau)=95 -> 95/48 ≈ 1.97 -> floor(1.97)=1.\n      So t in [1,1].\n\n  Another example: freeway2: (48,37,right,12) -> wait, head=48, tail=37? But then the initial span is [37,48]? Then at time0: [37,48] -> doesn't cover 0? \n      Condition: t_min = (0-48)/12 = -4 -> ceil(-4) = -4, but t>=0 so we take max(ceil((0-48)/12),0) but actually we only consider t>=0? \n      And t_max = (0-37)/12 = -37/12 ≈ -3.08 -> floor(-3.08) = -4 -> then the interval is [-4, -4]? But we are only concerned with t>=0. So no t in [0,infty) covers 0? \n\n  But wait, the second car on freeway2: (0,-11,right,12). Then head=0, tail=-11. Then:\n      t_min = (0-0)/12 = 0 -> ceil(0)=0.\n      t_max = (0 - (-11))/12 = 11/12 ≈ 0.916 -> floor(0.916)=0.\n      So at t=0: [ -11+0, 0+0] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Yes.\n\n  So at time0, freeway2 has two cars: one at [37,48] (which doesn't cover 0) and one at [-11,0] (which does cover 0). So at time0, freeway2 is unsafe.\n\n  Similarly, freeway3: same as freeway2? Then also unsafe at time0.\n\n  Freeway4: (48,83,left,36). For left-moving car:\n      Span at time t: [h - s*t, tau - s*t] = [48-36t, 83-36t]\n      Condition: 48-36t <= 0 <= 83-36t\n      => 48-36t <= 0 -> 36t>=48 -> t>=48/36=4/3≈1.33 -> t>= ceil(1.33)=2? \n            and 0<=83-36t -> 36t<=83 -> t<=83/36≈2.305 -> t<=2.\n      So t=2: [48-72=-24, 83-72=11] -> 0 is between -24 and 11 -> covered.\n\n      So unsafe at t=2.\n\n  Similarly, freeway5: same as freeway4 -> unsafe at t=2.\n\n  Freeway6: (-48,-59,right,6). \n      Right-moving: [tau + 6t, h + 6t] = [-59+6t, -48+6t]\n      Condition: -59+6t <=0<=-48+6t\n      => 6t>=48 -> t>=8, and 6t<=59 -> t<=59/6≈9.83 -> so t in [8,9] (integers: 8,9).\n      So unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\n  Freeway7: two cars: (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4)\n      First car: (48,37,right,4): \n          t_min = (0-48)/4 = -12 -> ceil(-12)=-12 -> we consider t>=0 -> so lower bound 0? but condition: 37+4t<=0<=48+4t -> 37+4t<=0 -> t<= -37/4 -> impossible? so never covers 0.\n      Second car: (0,-11,right,4):\n          t_min = (0-0)/4=0, t_max = (0 - (-11))/4 = 11/4=2.75 -> floor=2.\n          So t in [0,2]: at t=0: [-11,0] -> covers 0; t=1: [-7,4] -> covers 0? 0 is between -7 and 4 -> yes; t=2: [-3,8] -> covers 0? yes. t=3: [1,12] -> no.\n          So unsafe at t=0,1,2.\n\n  Freeway8: (-48,-59,right,3)\n      [ -59+3t, -48+3t]\n      Condition: -59+3t<=0<=-48+3t\n      => 3t>=48 -> t>=16, and 3t<=59 -> t<=59/3≈19.66 -> so t in [16,19] (integers 16,17,18,19).\n\nNow, we can build a table for each freeway k (1..8) and each time t (we are going to consider t from 0 up to a certain limit, say 20? but we might need more) whether it is safe.\n\nBut note: the minimal steps to go from 0 to 9 is 9. But we might have to wait. So we might need up to 20 or 30 steps? \n\nWe can do a BFS in the state (t, y) for t from 0 to, say, 50 and y from 0 to 9.\n\nWe start at (0,0). At each state (t, y), we consider next actions (U, D, S) that lead to (t+1, y') where:\n  if U: y' = min(y+1,9)\n  if D: y' = max(y-1,0)\n  if S: y' = y\n\nBut note: we cannot go beyond 0 or 9.\n\nThen we check: at the next state (t+1, y'), we must not have a collision? Actually, the collision happens at the time of the turn. When we are at state (t, y), that means at time t we are at row y. Then we take an action to move to y' at time t+1.\n\nThe collision condition: at time t (the current state) we are at row y. We must check that row y at time t is safe? \n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". \n\nSo at time t, we are at row y, so we must check safe(t, y). \n\nHowever, note that if we are at row 0 or 9, then no car -> safe. For rows 1-8, we check our precomputed safe(t, y).\n\nTherefore, in the state (t, y), we must have that safe(t, y) is True.\n\nThen from (t, y), we can go to (t+1, y') with y' being:\n  if we do U: y' = min(y+1,9)\n  if we do D: y' = max(y-1,0)\n  if we do S: y' = y\n\nBut then at the next state (t+1, y'), we require safe(t+1, y').\n\nWe start at (0,0): \n   at time0, y0=0 -> safe(0,0)=True (since freeway0 has no cars).\nThen we take an action at time0 to move to time1 at y1.\n\nWe want to reach a state (t,9) and then we stop. And we want the minimal t such that we can get to (t,9) with safe(t,9)=True (which is always true) and the path is safe.\n\nWe can use BFS (queue) that stores (t, y) and the path (or parent pointers) to record the actions.\n\nWe need to precompute the safety for each (t, y) for y in [1,8] and t from 0 to a limit. What limit? The worst-case minimal steps is 9, but we might have to wait. The worst-case waiting might be until the cars pass. The longest car blocking we have? For freeway8: blocks until t=19? So we might need to consider t up to 20 or 30.\n\nBut note: we can also move down to avoid? but we are starting at 0 and going to 9, so moving down might not be beneficial? However, sometimes we might have to wait at a safe row. But if we are at row0, we can only go up to row1 or stay. Similarly, row9 is goal.\n\nGiven that the minimal steps is 9, and we might have to wait a few turns, we can set a limit for t: let's say 30.\n\nPrecomputation for safe(t, k) for k=1..8 and t=0..30.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway:\n\nFreeway1: k=1, cars: [ (-48,-95,right,48) ]\n  Condition: t_min = ceil((0 - (-48))/48) = ceil(48/48)=ceil(1)=1\n            t_max = floor((0 - (-95))/48)=floor(95/48)=floor(1.97)=1\n  So unsafe at t=1.\n\nFreeway2: k=2, cars: [(48,37,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)]\n  Car1: (48,37,right,12): \n        t_min = ceil((0-48)/12)=ceil(-4)= -4 -> but we only consider t>=0, so no t in [0,infty) satisfies: because 37+12t<=0 -> t<=-37/12 (negative) -> never unsafe from this car.\n  Car2: (0,-11,right,12):\n        t_min = ceil((0-0)/12)=ceil(0)=0\n        t_max = floor((0 - (-11))/12)=floor(11/12)=0\n        So unsafe only at t=0.\n\n  Therefore, freeway2: unsafe at t=0 (from car2). At t>=1, safe.\n\nFreeway3: k=3, same as freeway2: unsafe at t=0, safe for t>=1.\n\nFreeway4: k=4, cars: [(48,83,left,36)]\n  Condition: \n        t_min = ceil( (0-48)/(-36) )? Wait, for left-moving: \n          Condition: 48-36t <= 0 <= 83-36t\n          => 48-36t<=0 -> t>=48/36=4/3≈1.33 -> ceil(1.33)=2\n          => 0<=83-36t -> 36t<=83 -> t<=83/36≈2.305 -> floor(2.305)=2\n        So unsafe at t=2.\n\nFreeway5: k=5, same as freeway4: unsafe at t=2.\n\nFreeway6: k=6, cars: [(-48,-59,right,6)]\n  Condition: \n        t_min = ceil((0 - (-48))/6)=ceil(48/6)=ceil(8)=8\n        t_max = floor((0 - (-59))/6)=floor(59/6)=floor(9.833)=9\n        So unsafe at t=8,9.\n\nFreeway7: k=7, cars: [(48,37,right,4), (0,-11,right,4)]\n  Car1: (48,37,right,4): \n        t_min = ceil((0-48)/4)=ceil(-12)=-12 -> then for t>=0: \n              Condition: 37+4t<=0 -> t<= -37/4 -> impossible -> safe.\n  Car2: (0,-11,right,4):\n        t_min = ceil((0-0)/4)=0\n        t_max = floor((0 - (-11))/4)=floor(11/4)=2\n        So unsafe at t=0,1,2.\n\nFreeway8: k=8, cars: [(-48,-59,right,3)]\n  Condition: \n        t_min = ceil((0 - (-48))/3)=ceil(48/3)=16? 48/3=16 -> ceil(16)=16\n        t_max = floor((0 - (-59))/3)=floor(59/3)=floor(19.666)=19\n        So unsafe at t=16,17,18,19.\n\nSummary of unsafe (t, k):\n\nk=1: t=1\nk=2: t=0\nk=3: t=0\nk=4: t=2\nk=5: t=2\nk=6: t=8,9\nk=7: t=0,1,2\nk=8: t=16,17,18,19\n\nNow, we can build a grid for t=0 to 30 and y=0..9:\n\ny=0: always safe.\ny=9: always safe.\ny=1: unsafe at t=1? -> from above, k=1 is unsafe at t=1 -> so at (t=1, y=1): unsafe.\ny=2: unsafe at t=0 -> so at (t=0, y=2): unsafe? but we start at t0=0 at y0=0, so we are not at y=2 at t=0. But if we were, it would be unsafe.\ny=3: unsafe at t=0 -> same as above.\ny=4: unsafe at t=2.\ny=5: unsafe at t=2.\ny=6: unsafe at t=8,9.\ny=7: unsafe at t=0,1,2.\ny=8: unsafe at t=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow, we do BFS:\n\nWe start: (t=0, y=0) -> safe.\n\nWe consider actions: U, D, S.\n\nBut D: from y=0, D -> y=0 -> next state (1,0)\nS: (1,0)\nU: (1,1)\n\nNow, at (1,1): we check safety at time1 on freeway1: unsafe? yes, because k=1 is unsafe at t=1 -> so (1,1) is unsafe -> we cannot go there.\n\nSo from (0,0) we can only do D or S? But D and S both lead to (1,0). And then from (1,0) we can do:\n\nAt (1,0): safe (since y=0). Then actions:\n  U: (2,1) -> now at time2, freeway1: we look at k=1: unsafe only at t=1 -> so at t=2, safe? yes. So (2,1) is safe.\n  D: (2,0)\n  S: (2,0)\n\nSo we have:\n\nState (0,0) -> action S: to (1,0) [or D: same]\nThen from (1,0): action U: to (2,1)\n\nNow at (2,1): safe? y=1 at t=2: k=1 is safe at t=2 (only unsafe at t=1) -> safe.\n\nFrom (2,1): we can do:\n  U: (3,2) -> check: at time3, y=2: freeway2: unsafe only at t=0 -> safe at t=3 -> safe.\n  D: (3,0) -> safe.\n  S: (3,1) -> check: y=1 at t=3: safe? yes.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as fast as possible. So we should try to move up.\n\nLet me try:\n\nStart: (0,0): safe -> we can do S (or D, but same effect) to avoid the unsafe (1,1). \n\nThen at (1,0): we do U -> (2,1) [safe]\n\nAt (2,1): we do U -> (3,2) [safe]\n\nAt (3,2): we do U -> (4,3) [safe? freeway3 at t=4: unsafe only at t=0 -> safe]\n\nAt (4,3): U -> (5,4) [at time5, freeway4: unsafe only at t=2 -> safe]\n\nAt (5,4): U -> (6,5) [freeway5: unsafe at t=2 -> safe at t=6]\n\nAt (6,5): U -> (7,6) [freeway6: unsafe at t=8,9 -> safe at t=7]\n\nAt (7,6): U -> (8,7) [freeway7: unsafe at t=0,1,2 -> safe at t=8]\n\nAt (8,7): U -> (9,8) [freeway8: unsafe at t=16-19 -> safe at t=9]\n\nAt (9,8): U -> (10,9) [goal]\n\nSo total turns: from t0=0 to t10=10? But note: the turn when we are at (10,9) is turn 10. But we started at turn0. The number of actions is 10 (from t0 to t9?).\n\nWait: we take an action at each turn. At turn0 we take an action to go to state at turn1. We are at (0,0) at turn0. Then:\n\nTurn0: action -> then at turn1 we are at new y.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at some turn T. So at turn T, we have y_T=9.\n\nIn the above:\n\nTurn0: start at (0,0) -> then we take an action. If we take S at turn0, then at turn1 we are at (0,0)? But we are still at y=0 at turn1.\n\nBut we did:\n\nTurn0: S -> at turn1: (1,0)\nTurn1: U -> at turn2: (2,1)\nTurn2: U -> at turn3: (3,2)\nTurn3: U -> at turn4: (4,3)\nTurn4: U -> at turn5: (5,4)\nTurn5: U -> at turn6: (6,5)\nTurn6: U -> at turn7: (7,6)\nTurn7: U -> at turn8: (8,7)\nTurn8: U -> at turn9: (9,8)\nTurn9: U -> at turn10: (10,9) -> goal.\n\nSo we reach at turn10. The sequence has 10 actions: from turn0 to turn9.\n\nBut is this minimal? Without obstacles, we could have done 9 moves: 9 consecutive U. But at turn1 we would be at (1,1) which is unsafe. So we had to wait one turn. Then we moved up every turn. So 10 turns is the minimal? \n\nBut wait, what if we start by moving up at turn0? Then at turn1 we would be at (1,1) -> which is unsafe. So we cannot.\n\nAlternatively, we could do at turn0: D -> then at turn1: (1,0) -> same as S.\n\nSo we must wait at least one turn.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 9 turns? We start at (0,0) and after 9 actions we are at turn9: y9=9. But then the positions:\n\nAt turn0: (0,0) -> safe\nTurn1: we must have y1>=0, and to get to 9 in 9 moves, we must move up 9 times. So:\n  turn1: y1=1 -> unsafe (because k=1 at t=1: unsafe) -> collision.\n\nSo indeed we must avoid being at y=1 at t=1. Therefore, we cannot do 9 moves. Minimal is 10.\n\nBut what about going faster? We did 10 moves. But note: we could have done:\n\nAt turn0: S -> turn1: (1,0)\nAt turn1: U -> turn2: (2,1) [safe]\nAt turn2: U -> turn3: (3,2) [safe]\nAt turn3: U -> turn4: (4,3) [safe]\nAt turn4: U -> turn5: (5,4) [safe]\nAt turn5: U -> turn6: (6,5) [safe]\nAt turn6: U -> turn7: (7,6) [safe]\nAt turn7: U -> turn8: (8,7) [safe]\nAt turn8: U -> turn9: (9,8) [safe]\nAt turn9: U -> turn10: (10,9) [goal]\n\nBut can we do better? What if we skip one of the moves? We have to go through every row.\n\nAlternatively, we could have moved up faster? But we are moving one per turn.\n\nBut note: we are blocked at row1 at turn1, so we have to avoid that. We did by staying at turn0 and then moving up at turn1 to row1 at turn2 (which is safe).\n\nIs there a path that takes 10 turns? We have one.\n\nBut wait: at turn7: we are at row6? Then at turn7: we go to row7 -> but row7 at turn7: is it safe? \n\nFreeway7: unsafe at t=0,1,2 -> t=7 is safe -> yes.\n\nAt turn8: row8: freeway8 at t=8: unsafe at t=16-19 -> safe -> yes.\n\nSo the above sequence is safe.\n\nBut what about row6 at turn6: freeway6 is unsafe at t=8,9 -> so at t=6: safe -> yes.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn0: S\nTurn1: U\nTurn2: U\nTurn3: U\nTurn4: U\nTurn5: U\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\n\nThis gets us to (10,9). But we started at turn0, and we took 10 actions (from turn0 to turn9) to get to turn10.\n\nBut the problem: we are starting at turn t1=0, and we need to output the actions for turns t1, t1+1, ... until the last action.\n\nThe minimal H is the number of actions? Or the number of turns including the starting turn? The problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence of actions for t from t1 to t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9).\n\nIn the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and after H actions we are at (0,9). \n\nWe start at (0,0) at turn0. After 10 actions (H=10) we are at turn0+10 = turn10 at (0,9). \n\nBut note: the last action is at turn9: we do U to go from 8 to 9, so at turn10 we are at 9.\n\nSo H=10.\n\nBut we can also do D at turn0? It would be the same: we end at (1,0) at turn1.\n\nSo two possibilities: \n  Option1: [S, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U] \n  Option2: [D, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U]\n\nBut both are 10 moves.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns\", so 10 is minimal.\n\nBut is there a path that takes less than 10? We argued no because we cannot go through row1 at turn1.\n\nSo we output:\n\nTurn 0: S   (or D, but let's choose S to be safe? Actually the problem doesn't care as long as minimal H. But we can choose either. However, note: if we choose D at turn0, we are still at row0 at turn1. Then we move up. But row0 is safe always.\n\nBut the problem: the initial position is (0,0) at turn0. Then we take action at turn0. Then at turn1 we are at the new position.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions for t from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSo we need to output 10 actions.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\"\n\nWe have H=10.\n\nBut let me check if we can do 10 with S:\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn0: S\nTurn1: U\nTurn2: U\nTurn3: U\nTurn4: U\nTurn5: U\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\n\nNow, let's verify each step:\n\nAt turn0: we are at (0,0) -> safe (y=0) -> then we do S -> so at turn1 we are at (0,0). But the action is taken at turn0: we are at (0,0) at turn0 -> safe.\n\nAt turn1: we are at (0,0) -> safe. Then we do U -> so at turn2: (0,1) -> we must check: at turn1, we are at row0 (so safe) and then we move to row1 at turn2.\n\nAt turn2: we are at row1 -> check time2: freeway1: unsafe only at time1 -> so safe.\n\nThen at turn2: we do U -> to row2 at turn3: at turn3, row2: freeway2: unsafe only at time0 -> safe.\n\nAt turn3: U -> to row3 at turn4: safe (freeway3: unsafe only at time0)\n\nAt turn4: U -> to row4 at turn5: safe (freeway4: unsafe at time2 -> time5 safe)\n\nAt turn5: U -> to row5 at turn6: safe (freeway5: unsafe at time2)\n\nAt turn6: U -> to row6 at turn7: safe (freeway6: unsafe at time8,9 -> time7 safe)\n\nAt turn7: U -> to row7 at turn8: safe (freeway7: unsafe at time0,1,2 -> time8 safe)\n\nAt turn8: U -> to row8 at turn9: safe (freeway8: unsafe at time16-19 -> time9 safe)\n\nAt turn9: U -> to row9 at turn10: goal.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nWe could have done D at turn0: then at turn1 we are at (0,0) as well. Then same as above.\n\nBut the problem: we are to output one minimal sequence. So we can choose the one with S.\n\nBut note: the problem says the initial position is (0,0) at turn0, and we are to start the actions at turn0.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 0: S\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n\nBut wait: the last action is at turn9, and after that we are at turn10 at (0,9). \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the turn after the last action? \n\nThe player update: after action a_t, we get y_{t+1}. So after the last action (at turn9) we get y_{10}=9.\n\nSo we have reached at turn10. And we have taken 10 actions.\n\nBut the problem: the sequence is for turns t1 (0) to t1+H-1 (0+10-1=9). So 10 actions.\n\nSo H=10.\n\nBut note: we must output in the format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: S\nTurn 1: U\n...\nTurn 9: U\n}\n\nBut the turn labels: \"Turn 0\", \"Turn 1\", ... \"Turn 9\"\n\nBut the problem says: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and then \"Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\" ... until \"Turn t_1 + H -1\".\n\nSo we have:\n\nTurn 0: S\nTurn 1: U\n...\nTurn 9: U\n\nBut note: the first action is at turn0, which is a_{t1} (t1=0). Then the last is at turn9 = t1+9.\n\nSo H=10? But the last index is t1+9, so H-1=9 -> H=10.\n\nYes.\n\nBut is there a path that takes 10 moves but avoids the unsafe times and is faster? We don't have to move up every time. But we did move up every time after the first wait. So it's 10 moves.\n\nBut wait: what if we do not wait at the beginning? We have to avoid being at row1 at turn1. So we must not move up at turn0. So we have to do S or D at turn0. Then we move up at turn1 to row1 at turn2 (which is safe). Then we move up every turn. So 10 moves.\n\nAlternatively, we could wait more? But that would be more than 10.\n\nSo minimal is 10.\n\nBut note: we might move down to avoid a future collision? But in this case, we don't have any collision after the initial wait. So no need.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: S\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n}\n\nBut let me check if we can do without the initial wait? We cannot because at turn0: if we do U, we go to row1 at turn1 -> unsafe.\n\nIf we do S or D, we stay at row0 at turn1 -> safe.\n\nSo we must.\n\nBut what if we do D at turn0? Then we are still at row0 at turn1. Then we do U at turn1 to row1 at turn2 -> safe. Then same as above. So we could output:\n\nTurn0: D\nTurn1: U\n...\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify which one. We can choose S.\n\nHowever, note that if we do D at turn0, we are at row0 at turn1. But row0 is the bottom, and we are going up, so it's the same.\n\nBut the problem: the initial position is (0,0) and we can do S or D? But the grid: y=0,1,...,9. At y=0, if we do D, we stay at 0. Similarly for S.\n\nSo both are valid. But we'll choose S.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns\", and both are 10. So we can choose either.\n\nBut to be safe, we choose S because it doesn't change the position.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: S\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n}\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by waiting at \\(y = 0\\) for one turn to avoid the unsafe condition at \\(y = 1\\) on turn 1, then moving up consistently each turn.\n\n### Verification of the Path:\n- **Turn 0 (Start)**: Position \\((0, 0)\\). Action \\(S\\) (stay) keeps the player at \\((0, 0)\\) for turn 1. Safe (no cars at \\(y = 0\\)).\n- **Turn 1**: Position \\((0, 0)\\). Action \\(U\\) (up) moves to \\((0, 1)\\) for turn 2. At turn 1, the player is at \\(y = 0\\), which is safe.\n- **Turn 2**: Position \\((0, 1)\\). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 2)\\) for turn 3.

At turn 5, \\(y = 4\\): freeway 4 is unsafe only at turn 2, so safe.\n- **Turn 6**: Position \\((0, 5)\\). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 6)\\) for turn 7. At turn 6, \\(y = 5\\): freeway 5 is unsafe only at turn 2, so safe.\n- **Turn 7**: Position \\((0, 6)\\). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 7)\\) for turn 8.

At turn 9, \\(y = 8\\): freeway 8 is unsafe at turns 16–19, so safe. Goal reached at turn 10.\n\n### Why Minimal?\n- Without obstacles, 9 consecutive \"U\" actions would reach \\(y = 9\\) in 9 turns. However, at turn 1, moving to \\(y = 1\\) is unsafe (freeway 1 covers \\(x = 0\\) at turn 1).

Each turn, I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but I have to stay within 0 to 9.\n\nThe collision condition is that at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes linearly with time based on speed and direction.\n\nAlso, when I move, I'm not on the new freeway until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe initial turn is t_1, which is given as t_0 = 1, but it says t_1, and in the task it's turn t_1. Looking back:\n\n\"current turn is \\{t_1\\}\" and \"Given the inital position \\((0, y_{t_1})\\)\" and later \"Current Turn: \\( t_0 = 1 \\)\", but it says t_0=1, but in the text it's t_1. I think t_1 is 1. Let me check.\n\n\"Current Turn: \\( t_0 = 1 \\)\" and it says t_0=1, but in the problem it's referred to as t_1. Probably a typo; I think t_1 is 1.\n\nSimilarly, player position (0,0).\n\nNow, I need to find actions from t=1 to some H, ending at y=9.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nFirst, since I start at y=0 and need to go to y=9, the minimum number of moves if no cars would be 9 up moves, so H=10 turns? Let's see: at turn 1, I start at y=0. After first action, at turn 2, I move to y= something.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t, I perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe update is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so after action at t, position at t+1.\n\nSo at turn t, position is (0, y_t), I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo to go from y_t to y_{t+1}, etc.\n\nStart at turn t=1, y_1 = 0.\n\nAfter H turns, meaning after H actions, at turn t=1+H, position y_{1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{1+H} = 9.\n\nAnd the actions are from t=1 to t=1+H-1? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, with t_1=1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so a_{1+0}, a_{1+1}, ..., a_{1+H-1}, which is a_1 to a_{1+H-1}, that's H actions.\n\nThen after these, at time t=1+H, y_{1+H} = 9.\n\nSince y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and we start at y_1=0, after H actions, y_{1+H} = y_1 + sum_{t=1 to 1+H-1} Δy_t = 0 + sum_{k=1 to H} Δy_{k}? Let's index properly.\n\nSet t starting from 1.\n\nAt time step τ, position y_τ.\n\nAction a_τ chosen at τ, affects y_{τ+1}.\n\ny_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ\n\nSo from τ to τ+1, position changes.\n\nStart: τ=1, y_1=0\n\nAfter action a_1, y_2 = y_1 + Δy_1\n\nAfter a_2, y_3 = y_2 + Δy_2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T\n\nWe want y_{H+1} = 9 for some H.\n\nThe number of actions is H, and we reach y_{H+1} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=1 to t=H, but the answer format says for turn t_1, t_1+1, etc., so for each turn, we specify the action.\n\nAnd H is the number of turns we take actions, so from turn 1 to turn H, we take actions, and at turn H+1, we are at position y_{H+1}=9.\n\nBut the position is only defined after the action, I think.\n\nAt turn τ, we are at position (0, y_τ), then we choose a_τ, then we move to (0, y_{τ+1}).\n\nFor collision: at turn τ, we are on freeway y_τ, and we check if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at time τ.\n\nThe car span at time T is given for T > t_1, but since t_1=1, we can compute for any T.\n\nCar span at time T: for each car, given initial at t_1=1.\n\nFor car on freeway k, with head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nAt time T, span is:\n\nIf left-moving, span(T) = [h - s(T-1), τ - s(T-1)]? Let's see.\n\nFrom the rule: Span(t_1) at t_1, then at T > t_1, Span(T) = [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)] for left-moving.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, head and tail: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] I think, but in the table, for freeway 1, car (0, -47, right, 48), so head h=0, tail τ=-47, direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h]? No.\n\nLook: \"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIt says Span(t_1) = [h, τ] for left-moving? But in the car state, for freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48), so if direction is right, it should be different.\n\nRead carefully:\n\n\"Car update rules:\n\nFor car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t_1, and speed s.\n\nThen at turn T > t_1:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t_1) is given as [τ, h], which from the car state, for freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48), so head h=0, tail τ=-47, and since right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-47, 0]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\n\nIn the car state table, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nSo for collision at turn T, on freeway y_T, we need that for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in Span(T).\n\nSpan(T) is the interval occupied by the car at time T.\n\nIf 0 is in that interval, and I'm on that freeway at that time, collision.\n\nNow, importantly, when I move, at turn T, if I choose to move up or down, at turn T I'm still on y_T, and only at T+1 I'm on the new row.\n\nBut for collision, it's only based on where I am at turn T, which is y_T, and the cars on that row at time T.\n\nNow, I need to get to y=9, which is not a freeway, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so no collision possible on y=0 or y=9.\n\nIs that right?\n\n\"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8\"\n\nAnd y=0 and y=9 are not mentioned, so probably safe, no cars.\n\nAlso, in the position, y=0 and y=9 are allowed.\n\nSo at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nI start at y=0, turn 1, position (0,0), so at turn 1, I'm on y=0, which has no cars, so no collision at turn 1, regardless.\n\nThen I need to reach y=9, which is also safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to be at y=9 at some turn, meaning after an action, y_{τ} =9 for some τ.\n\nIn the target, we want y_{t_1 + H} =9? Earlier I had y_{H+1} =9.\n\nSet τ = turn number.\n\nAt turn τ, position y_τ.\n\nWe start at τ=1, y_1=0\n\nAfter actions a_1 to a_H, we have y_2 to y_{H+1}, and we want y_{H+1} =9.\n\nH is the number of actions, so we take H actions from turn 1 to turn H, and end at position after turn H, which is y_{H+1}=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for turn t_1=1 to turn t_1 + H -1? t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so turns 1 to 1+H-1 = H, so actions at turns 1 to H, and after that, at turn H+1, position is 9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, minimal H such that we can achieve y_{H+1}=9 without collision at any turn from 1 to H+1? Collision at turn τ depends on y_τ.\n\nAt turn τ, if y_τ is between 1 and 8, we need to avoid collision, meaning no car on that freeway with 0 in span at τ.\n\nIf y_τ =0 or 9, no collision possible.\n\nFor the turns when we are on y=1 to 8, we need to be safe.\n\nSince we start at y=0, turn 1, safe.\n\nWe end at y=9, turn H+1, safe.\n\nDuring the path, from turn 2 to turn H, if y_τ between 1 and 8, need no collision.\n\ny_τ for τ from 1 to H+1, but at τ=1, y_1=0, safe; at τ=H+1, y_{H+1}=9, safe; for τ from 2 to H, if y_τ in 1-8, need safe.\n\nNow, the net displacement: from y_1=0 to y_{H+1}=9, so the sum of Δy from t=1 to t=H must be +9.\n\nEach Δy is +1, -1, or 0, so the number of up moves minus down moves must be 9, and the number of stay moves can be arbitrary, but to minimize H, we probably want as few stay moves as possible, so ideally 9 up moves and no down or stay, so H=9 actions, and y_{10}=9.\n\nBut with cars, we might need to wait or go down sometimes.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their spans over time.\n\nt_1=1.\n\nFor each freeway, the cars at time T.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, (head h=0, tail τ=-47, direction right, speed s=48)\n\nSince right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-47, 0] at T=1.\n\nAt time T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-1), h + s(T-1)] = [-47 + 48(T-1), 0 + 48(T-1)] = [48(T-1) -47, 48(T-1)]\n\nNow, collision on freeway 1 at time T if y_T=1 and 0 in Span(T), i.e., 0 ∈ [48(T-1) -47, 48(T-1)]\n\nWhich is true when 48(T-1) -47 ≤ 0 ≤ 48(T-1)\n\nSince 48(T-1) -47 ≤ 0 implies 48(T-1) ≤ 47, T-1 ≤ 47/48 <1, so T-1=0, T=1.\n\nAt T=1, 48(0)-47 = -47, 48(0)=0, so [-47,0], 0 is included.\n\nBut at T=1, if we are on freeway 1, but at T=1, we are at y_1=0, not on freeway 1, so no issue.\n\nFor T>1, 48(T-1) -47 >0 for T-1≥1, since 48(1)-47=1>0, so Span(T) = [48(T-1)-47, 48(T-1)] which is positive for T≥2, and 0 is not in it since min is at least 1 for T=2, etc. So for freeway 1, only possible collision at T=1, but y not 1, so always safe for freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49, right,12) head=60, tail=49, direction right, speed=12\n\nRight-moving, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [49,60] at T=1.\n\nAt time T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-1), h + s(T-1)] = [49 + 12(T-1), 60 + 12(T-1)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1, right,12) head=12, tail=1, direction right, so Span(t_1) = [1,12]\n\nAt T, Span(T) = [1 + 12(T-1), 12 + 12(T-1)] = [12(T-1) +1, 12(T-1) +12]\n\nNow, collision on freeway 2 at T if y_T=2 and 0 in some car's span.\n\nFirst car: [49 +12(T-1), 60+12(T-1)] which for T≥1, min is 49>0, so 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [12(T-1) +1, 12(T-1) +12]\n\n0 in this if 12(T-1)+1 ≤ 0 ≤ 12(T-1)+12\n\nSince 12(T-1)+1 >0 for T≥1, left is at least 1, so 0 not in, always positive.\n\nSo for freeway 2, no car has 0 in span at any T, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, cars (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12), same as above, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 4: one car, (12,47, left,36)\n\nDirection left, so Span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [12,47] at T=1.\n\nAt time T, Span(T) = [h - s(T-1), τ - s(T-1)] = [12 - 36(T-1), 47 - 36(T-1)]\n\nCollision if 0 in this interval.\n\nSo 12 - 36(T-1) ≤ 0 ≤ 47 - 36(T-1)\n\nFirst inequality: 12 -36(T-1) ≤ 0 => 36(T-1) ≥12 => T-1 ≥ 12/36 =1/3, so T≥2 since T integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 47 -36(T-1) => 36(T-1) ≤47 => T-1 ≤ 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so T-1≤1 since integer, T≤2.\n\nSo for T=2: T-1=1, Span(2) = [12-36(1), 47-36(1)] = [-24, 11]\n\n0 is in [-24,11], yes.\n\nFor T=1: Span(1) = [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nT=3: Span(3) = [12-72, 47-72] = [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=2, for freeway 4, 0 is in span, so unsafe at T=2 if on y=4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as freeway 4, car (12,47,left,36), so unsafe only at T=2.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car, (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nDirection right, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-53,-42] at T=1.\n\nAt T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-1), h + s(T-1)] = [-53 +6(T-1), -42 +6(T-1)]\n\nCollision if 0 in this.\n\n-53 +6(T-1) ≤ 0 ≤ -42 +6(T-1)\n\nFirst: -53 +6(T-1) ≤0 => 6(T-1) ≤53 => T-1 ≤ 53/6 ≈8.833, so T≤9\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -42 +6(T-1) => 42 ≤ 6(T-1) => 7 ≤ T-1 => T≥8\n\nSo for T from 8 to 9 inclusive? T-1 from 7 to 8.833, so T=8,9\n\nT=8: T-1=7, Span(8) = [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11, 0], 0 in it.\n\nT=9: T-1=8, Span(9) = [-53+48, -42+48] = [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nT=10: Span(10) = [-53+54, -42+54] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe for freeway 6 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (52,41,right,4) head=52, tail=41, direction right.\n\nSpan(t_1) = [τ, h] = [41,52] at T=1.\n\nAt T, Span(T) = [41 +4(T-1), 52 +4(T-1)] min 41>0, so 0 not in, safe.\n\nSecond car: (4,-7,right,4) head=4, tail=-7, direction right.\n\nSpan(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-7,4] at T=1.\n\nAt T, Span(T) = [-7 +4(T-1), 4 +4(T-1)] = [4(T-1) -7, 4(T-1) +4]\n\nCollision if 0 in this.\n\n4(T-1) -7 ≤ 0 ≤ 4(T-1) +4\n\nFirst: 4(T-1) -7 ≤0 => 4(T-1) ≤7 => T-1 ≤ 7/4=1.75, so T≤2.75, T=1,2\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 4(T-1) +4 always true for T≥1.\n\nAt T=1: Span(1) = [-7,4], 0 in it.\n\nT=2: Span(2) = [4(1)-7, 4(1)+4] = [-3,8], 0 in it.\n\nT=3: [4(2)-7, 4(2)+4] = [8-7,8+4]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 7, second car, unsafe at T=1 and T=2.\n\nFirst car safe.\n\nNow freeway 8: one car, (-45,-56,right,3)\n\nDirection right, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-56,-45] at T=1.\n\nAt T, Span(T) = [-56 +3(T-1), -45 +3(T-1)]\n\nCollision if 0 in this.\n\n-56 +3(T-1) ≤ 0 ≤ -45 +3(T-1)\n\nFirst: -56 +3(T-1) ≤0 => 3(T-1) ≤56 => T-1 ≤ 56/3≈18.666, so T≤19.666, T≤19\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -45 +3(T-1) => 45 ≤ 3(T-1) => 15 ≤ T-1 => T≥16\n\nSo for T from 16 to 19 inclusive.\n\nT=16: T-1=15, Span= [-56+45, -45+45] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nT=17: [-56+48, -45+48] = [-8,3], 0 in\n\nT=18: [-56+51, -45+51] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nT=19: [-56+54, -45+54] = [-2,9], 0 in\n\nT=20: [-56+57, -45+57] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe for freeway 8 at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow, summarize unsafe times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: always safe, as earlier\n\nFreeway 2: always safe\n\nFreeway 3: always safe\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe only at T=2\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe only at T=2\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe at T=8,9\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at T=1,2 (from second car)\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=16,17,18,19\n\nWe need to go from y=0 at turn 1 to y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince we start at turn 1, y=0, safe.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn H+1.\n\nThe path: we move step by step.\n\nEach move, we can change y by -1,0,+1, but constrained to 0-9.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nUnsafe times:\n\n- y=4 and y=5 at T=2: unsafe\n\n- y=7 at T=1 and T=2: unsafe\n\n- y=6 at T=8 and T=9: unsafe\n\n- y=8 at T=16 to 19: unsafe\n\nT=1: y=7 unsafe\n\nT=2: y=4,5,7 unsafe\n\nAlso, for other times, freeways might be safe.\n\nNow, since we need to reach y=9, and start from y=0.\n\nThe minimal time: if no obstacles, H=9, y_{10}=9.\n\nBut with obstacles, we might need to delay or something.\n\nFirst, at turn 1, we are at y=0, need to choose action a_1.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, then y_2 = y_1 + Δy_1 = 0 +1 =1\n\nIf D, y_2=0-1=-1, but y must be in 0-9, so y_{t+1} in [0,9], so from y=0, cannot go down, so D invalid. Similarly, from y=9, cannot go up.\n\nHere, at y=0, only U or S possible.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, only D or S.\n\nBut we start at y=0, so a_1 can be U or S.\n\nIf S, y_2=0, still at start.\n\nBut we need to move up eventually.\n\nTo save time, probably go up.\n\nBut let's see the unsafe points.\n\nAt turn 1, if we go to y=1, y_2=1.\n\nAt turn 1, position y_1=0, safe.\n\nAfter a_1, y_2 is set.\n\nAt turn 2, position y_2.\n\nIf y_2=1, which is freeway 1, and we need to check if safe at T=2.\n\nFreeway 1: as above, safe at all times, including T=2.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay, y_2=0, safe.\n\nBut staying wastes time.\n\nNow, at turn 2, if y_2=1, then we choose a_2, etc.\n\nBut we have unsafe at T=2 for y=4 and y=5.\n\nAlso, y=7 unsafe at T=1 and T=2.\n\nT=1 is turn 1, which has passed, we were at y=0.\n\nNow, for the path to y=9.\n\nSince y=4 and y=5 are unsafe at T=2, we need to avoid being on y=4 or y=5 at turn 2.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 unsafe at turn 2.\n\nAt turn 2, if we are on y=4,5, or 7, unsafe.\n\nBut y=1,2,3,6,8 might be safe at T=2.\n\ny=6 at T=2: from above, freeway 6 unsafe only at T=8,9, so at T=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at T=2: freeway 8 unsafe at T=16-19, so at T=2 safe.\n\ny=1,2,3 always safe.\n\nNow, we start at turn 1, y=0.\n\nAfter a_1, y_2 = 0 or 1.\n\nIf we go up, y_2=1 at turn 2.\n\nTurn 2 is T=2.\n\ny_2=1, freeway 1, safe.\n\nThen at turn 2, we choose a_2.\n\nWe can go to y_3=0,1,2.\n\nBut going down to 0 might not help, so probably up or stay.\n\nSimilarly, to reach 9, we need to go up.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on certain rows at certain times.\n\nSpecifically, we need to avoid:\n\n- Being on y=4 or y=5 at turn 2 (T=2)\n\n- Being on y=7 at turn 2 (T=2)\n\nAlso, later, being on y=6 at turn 8 or 9 (T=8,9)\n\nAnd on y=8 at turn 16 to 19 (T=16-19)\n\nSince we want minimal H, T=16-19 is far, so for minimal time, we can ignore that if we reach before T=16.\n\nSimilarly, T=8,9 might be relevant.\n\nFirst, minimal possible H: H=9, so we reach y_{10}=9 at turn 10.\n\nTurn 10 is T=10.\n\nNow, positions: at turn τ, y_τ.\n\nτ from 1 to 10 for positions, with y_1=0, y_{10}=9.\n\nThe actions from turn 1 to 9, determining y_2 to y_{10}.\n\ny_{10} = sum of Δy from t=1 to 9.\n\nSince y_1=0, y_{10} = sum_{t=1 to 9} Δy_t =9, so number of U minus number of D must be 9, and since H=9 actions, we must have exactly 9 U and 0 D or S, so we go up every turn.\n\ny_{10} = y_1 + sum_{t=1 to 9} Δy_t = 0 + sum =9.\n\nEach Δy_t = +1 for U, 0 for S, -1 for D.\n\nSo sum of Δy_t = number of U minus number of D =9.\n\nTotal actions 9, so if no S, then number of U =9, D=0.\n\nIf some S, then U - D =9, and U + D + S =9, so U=9, D=0, S=0, only possible with all U, no S or D.\n\nBecause if S, then U - D =9, U + D + S =9, subtract, D + S =0, so D=0,S=0,U=9.\n\nSimilarly, if D, then U must be more, but U + D <=9, U - D =9, only if D=0,U=9.\n\nSo for H=9, we must move up every turn, no down or stay.\n\nThus, y_τ = τ - 1 for τ from 1 to 10? y_1=0, after a_1 (U), y_2=1, after a_2 (U), y_3=2, ..., after a_9 (U), y_{10}=9.\n\nSo positions: turn 1: y=0, turn 2: y=1, turn 3: y=2, turn 4: y=3, turn 5: y=4, turn 6: y=5, turn 7: y=6, turn 8: y=7, turn 9: y=8, turn 10: y=9.\n\nNow, check collision at each turn when y between 1 and 8.\n\nTurn 1: y=0, safe\n\nTurn 2: y=1, freeway 1, safe as we saw\n\nTurn 3: y=2, freeway 2, always safe\n\nTurn 4: y=3, freeway 3, always safe\n\nTurn 5: y=4, freeway 4. At turn 5, T=5.\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe only at T=2, so at T=5 safe.\n\nTurn 6: y=5, freeway 5, unsafe only at T=2, T=6 safe.\n\nTurn 7: y=6, freeway 6, unsafe at T=8,9, T=7 safe.\n\nTurn 8: y=7, freeway 7. At T=8.\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at T=1,2, but at T=8, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 7 has cars, second car unsafe at T=1,2, but at T=8, Span(8) for second car: as above, at T=3, [1,12], and increasing, so at T=8, [4(7)-7, 4(7)+4] = [28-7,28+4]=[21,32], 0 not in, safe.\n\nFirst car also safe.\n\nSo freeway 7 safe at T=8.\n\nTurn 9: y=8, freeway 8, at T=9.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at T=16-19, T=9 safe.\n\nTurn 10: y=9, safe.\n\nIn this path, all turns are safe? But turn 5 y=4 T=5 safe, turn 6 y=5 T=6 safe, turn 7 y=6 T=7 safe, turn 8 y=7 T=8 safe, turn 9 y=8 T=9 safe.\n\nEarlier I thought y=4 and y=5 unsafe at T=2, but here at T=5 and T=6, safe.\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=1 and 2, but here at T=8, safe.\n\nSo for H=9, with all up moves, we reach in 9 turns, and no collision.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nTurn 2: y=1, T=2, freeway 1: as before, Span(T=2) = [48(1)-47,48(1)] = [1,48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 3: y=2, T=3, freeway 2: second car Span(T=3) = [12(2)+1,12(2)+12] = [24+1,24+12]=[25,36], 0 not in; first car [49+24,60+24]=[73,84], safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 4: y=3, freeway 3 same as 2.\n\nTurn 5: y=4, T=5, freeway 4: car Span(T=5) = [12 -36(4), 47-36(4)]? T=5, T-1=4, Span= [h - s(T-1), τ - s(T-1)] = [12 - 36*4, 47 - 36*4] = [12-144, 47-144] = [-132,-97], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 6: y=5, T=6, freeway 5 same, [12-36*5,47-36*5]=[12-180,47-180]=[-168,-133], safe.\n\nTurn 7: y=6, T=7, freeway 6: car Span(T=7) = [-53 +6(6), -42+6(6)] T-1=6, Span= [τ + s(T-1), h + s(T-1)] = [-53 +6*6, -42+6*6] = [-53+36, -42+36] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 8: y=7, T=8, freeway 7: second car Span(T=8) = [4(7)-7, 4(7)+4] = [28-7,28+4]=[21,32], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 9: y=8, T=9, freeway 8: Span(T=9) = [-56 +3(8), -45+3(8)] T-1=8, Span= [τ + s(T-1), h + s(T-1)] = [-56 +3*8, -45+3*8] = [-56+24, -45+24] = [-32,-21], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 10: y=9, safe.\n\nAnd turn 1: y=0, safe.\n\nSo all safe, and we can reach in H=9 turns with all U actions.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which we do at turn 10.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from turn 1 to turn 9, all U.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 6 at turn 7: y=6, T=7, Span=[-17,-6], not including 0, yes.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut earlier I thought freeway 7 unsafe at T=1,2, but at T=8 fine.\n\nAnd freeway 4 unsafe at T=2, but at T=5 fine.\n\nSo with all up, we can do it in 9 turns.\n\nBut is there a reason we cannot? The unsafe times are avoided naturally.\n\nPerhaps for minimality, H=9 is achievable.\n\nBut let me see if we can do faster? H=9 actions, from turn 1 to 9, position at turn 10.\n\nIf we want to reach earlier, say at turn 9, y_9=9.\n\nThen we need y_9=9, with y_1=0, so sum of Δy from t=1 to 8 must be 9? y_9 = y_1 + sum_{t=1 to 8} Δy_t = 0 + sum =9.\n\nActions from t=1 to 8, 8 actions.\n\nThen U - D =9, with U + D + S =8.\n\nThen U - D =9, U + D <=8, impossible since U <=8, U - D <=8 <9.\n\nSo impossible to reach before turn 10; minimal H is 9.\n\nWith 8 actions, max y_9=8, if all U, but we need 9, so must have at least 9 actions.\n\ny_1=0, after 8 actions, y_9 <=8, so y_9=9 impossible.\n\nThus minimal H is 9, and it is achievable with all U.\n\nBut in the car list, freeway 7 has a car that is unsafe at T=1 and T=2, but in our path, at T=8 we are on y=7, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut let me check freeway 4 at T=2: unsafe, but we are not on it at T=2; we are on it at T=5.\n\nIn our path, at turn 2, we are at y=1, not y=4.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U from turn 1 to turn 9.\n\nBut the answer should be for each turn.\n\nTurn 1: a_{t_1} = a_1\n\nSince t_1=1.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me confirm the initial state.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=1, position (0,0)\n\nCars as given.\n\nIn freeway 7, car (4,-7,right,4), at T=1 and T=2 unsafe, but we are on y=7 at T=8, fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH=9.\n\nSequence: all U.\n\nBut in the action, for each turn.\n\nBut let me see if at some point we need to avoid, but in this case no.\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother thing: when we move, at turn T, we are on y_T, and if we move, we are not on the new row until T+1.\n\nBut in this case, no issue.\n\nFor example, at turn 8, we are on y=7, which is freeway 7, and we move up, so at turn 8, we are on y=7, check cars on freeway 7 at T=8, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen after moving, at turn 9, we are on y=8, freeway 8, at T=9, safe.\n\nThen we move up to y=9 at turn 10.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps for y=6 at T=8 or 9 unsafe, but in our path, at T=7 we are on y=6, which is before T=8, safe.\n\nAt T=8 we are on y=7.\n\nSo not on y=6 at T=8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it works.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 6 has car unsafe at T=8 and T=9, but we are not there at those times.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo minimal H is 9, sequence all U.\n\nBut the answer format should be the actions.\n\nNow, for turn t_1=1 to turn t_1 + H -1 =1+9-1=9? t from 0 to H-1, so turns 1+0=1 to 1+8=9? H=9, t from 0 to 8, turns t_1 + t =1+0=1 to 1+8=9.\n\nActions at turns 1 to 9.\n\nEach action U.\n\nSo in the box:\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 9: U\n\nBut since all same, we can write.\n\nBut in the format, probably list each.\n\nSince it says \"a sequence\", and to box it.\n\nBut let me see if there is any constraint that forces us to wait.\n\nFor example, suppose we start and stay at turn 1, then y_2=0, then at turn 2, we are still at y=0, safe, but then we need to go up later, which might take more turns, so worse.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down, cannot from y=0.\n\nSo all U is best.\n\nPerhaps at some point, if we were to be on unsafe, but here not.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 7, at T=1, it is unsafe, but we are at y=0, not on it.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 8 at T=9: we are on it, but T=9 is not unsafe; unsafe from T=16.\n\nT=9 is fine.\n\nSpan as above.\n\nSo I think H=9 is achievable.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, and the sequence is U for each turn from 1 to 9.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, which is turn 1 to 9.\n\nNow, in the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut since all U, perhaps we can say all actions U, but I think listing is fine.\n\nThe problem says \"a sequence of actions\", so we need to specify.\n\nPerhaps in text.\n\nBut in the format given, it shows \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo I think this is it.\n\nBut I feel like I might have missed something because the cars have large spans and speeds, but in this case, for the times we are on, no collision.\n\nPerhaps for y=7 at T=2, but we are not on it then.\n\nAnother point: when we are at y=7 at turn 8, which is late, but safe.\n\nIf we could go faster, but we cannot.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can have some down or stay to avoid later issues, but since we reach before the unsafe times for y=8, no need.\n\nFor example, y=8 unsafe from T=16, we are at T=9, fine.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 unsafe at T=8,9, but we are at y=6 at T=7, which is safe, and then move to y=7 at T=8.\n\nNot on y=6 at T=8 or 9.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be H=9 with all U actions.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) is 9, with the sequence of actions consisting entirely of \"U\" (up) moves.\n\nThis sequence results in the following positions:\n- Turn 1: Position \\((0, 0)\\), safe (no freeway).\n- After action \\(a_1 = U\\): Position at turn 2 is \\((0, 1)\\).\n- Turn 2: Position \\((0, 1)\\), freeway 1, safe (car span at T=2 is [1, 48], 0 not in span).\n- After action \\(a_2 = U\\): Position at turn 3 is \\((0, 2)\\).\n- Turn 3: Position \\((0, 2)\\), freeway 2, safe (cars spans at T=3 are [25, 36] and [73, 84], 0 not in either).\n- After action \\(a_3 = U\\): Position at turn 4 is \\((0, 3)\\).\n- Turn 4: Position \\((0, 3)\\), freeway 3, safe (similar to freeway 2).\n- After action \\(a_4 = U\\): Position at turn 5 is \\((0, 4)\\).\n- Turn 5: Position \\((0, 4)\\), freeway 4, safe (car span at T=5 is [-132, -97], 0 not in span).\n- After action \\(a_5 = U\\): Position at turn 6 is \\((0, 5)\\).\n- Turn 6: Position \\((0, 5)\\), freeway 5, safe (car span at T=6 is [-168, -133], 0 not in span).\n- After action \\(a_6 = U\\): Position at turn 7 is \\((0, 6)\\).\n- Turn 7: Position \\((0, 6)\\), freeway 6, safe (car span at T=7 is [-17, -6], 0 not in span).\n- After action \\(a_7 = U\\): Position at turn 8 is \\((0, 7)\\).\n- Turn 8: Position \\((0, 7)\\), freeway 7, safe (car spans at T=8 are [73, 84] and [21, 32], 0 not in either).\n- After action \\(a_8 = U\\): Position at turn 9 is \\((0, 8)\\).\n- Turn 9: Position \\((0, 8)\\), freeway 8, safe (car span at T=9 is [-32, -21], 0 not in span).\n- After action \\(a_9 = U\\): Position at turn 10 is \\((0, 9)\\), safe (no freeway).\n\nAll positions from turn 1 to turn 10 are collision-free, and the target \\((0, 9)\\) is reached at turn 10 after 9 actions.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns 1 to 9 is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 1: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 2: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 3: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. I start at turn t_1 = 2, position y=1. Each turn, I can go up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but I have to stay within 0 to 9.\n\nCollisions happen only if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T, and there's a car on that freeway where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Also, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I only check for collisions on the freeway I'm currently on at that turn.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1=2, and I need to find where they are at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nFirst, I should figure out for each freeway and each possible turn when a car would be at x=0, because that's where collisions happen.\n\nThe collision condition is that for a car on freeway i at turn T, if 0 is in the span of that car at turn T, then if I'm on that freeway at that turn, I collide.\n\nBut since I'm only at x=0, I care about when the car's span includes x=0 at turn T.\n\nAlso, the car positions are linear with time, so I can compute for each car when x=0 is covered by it.\n\nLet me list all the cars and their movements.\n\nStart with freeway 1: only one car: (h, tau, d, s) = (48, 1, right, 48)\n\nSince it's right-moving, span at time T is [tau + s*(T - t_1), h + s*(T - t_1)]\n\nAt t_1=2, span is [tau, h] = [1,48] for right-moving? Let's see the notation.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [tau, h] → Span(T) = [tau + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for right-moving, at t_1, Span(t_1) = [tau, h]? But in the example for freeway 1: (48,1,right,48), so h=48, tau=1, so if right, span at t_1 is [tau, h] = [1,48], which makes sense since it's moving right, so head is at higher x.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, tau] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), tau - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn freeway 4: (-24,11,left,36), so h=-24, tau=11? But left-moving, span at t_1 should be [h, tau] = [-24,11], which is from left to right? No.\n\nI think I have confusion about head and tail.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, tau]\" and it moves left, so h is the head, which is the front, and since it's moving left, head has smaller x if left is negative, but x can be any integer, I assume.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, [h, tau] with h and tau, and since moving left, at time T, span is [h - s(T-t_1), tau - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for right, [tau + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nNow, for a car, the span includes all x from min to max of the span.\n\nCollision when 0 is in [min, max] of the span at time T for the freeway I'm on.\n\nFor freeway 1 at t_1=2: car (48,1,right,48), so at T, span = [1 + 48*(T-2), 48 + 48*(T-2)] = [1 + 48(T-2), 48 + 48(T-2)] = [48T - 96 +1, 48T -96 +48] = [48T -95, 48T -48]\n\n48(T-2) +1 and 48(T-2) +48.\n\nSet min = 48(T-2) +1, max = 48(T-2) +48\n\n0 is in [min, max] when min <= 0 <= max\n\nSo 48(T-2) +1 <= 0 and 0 <= 48(T-2) +48\n\nSince 48(T-2) +48 > 0 for all T>=2, because T-2 >=0, so 48*0 +48=48>0.\n\n48(T-2) +1 <=0 implies 48(T-2) <= -1, so T-2 <= -1/48, since T-2 integer, T-2 <= -1, so T <=1.\n\nBut T starts from t_1=2, so for T>=2, min =48(T-2)+1 >= 48(0)+1=1>0, so min >0, so 0 not in span for any T>=2. So no collision possible on freeway 1 for T>=2. Good.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nRight-moving, so at t_1=2, span [tau, h] = [-59, -48]? tau is tail, h is head.\n\nGiven: (head h, tail tau) so for this car, h=-48? head is -48, tail is -59? That seems odd.\n\n\" Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s) \"\n\nFor right-moving, head should be on the right, tail on left, so if head is -48 and tail is -59, since -48 > -59, so tail at -59, head at -48, so span from -59 to -48 at t_1.\n\nBut direction right, so moving to increasing x.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (24,13,right,12), head 24, tail 13, so span [13,24] at t_1.\n\nNow for first car: (-48, -59, right, 12) — head h=-48, tail tau=-59.\n\nAt time T, span = [tau + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-59 + 12(T-2), -48 + 12(T-2)]\n\nSet min = -59 + 12(T-2), max = -48 + 12(T-2)\n\n0 in span if min <= 0 <= max\n\nSo -59 + 12(T-2) <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 12(T-2)\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 12(T-2) <= 0 => 12(T-2) <= 59 => T-2 <= 59/12 = 4.916, so T-2 <= 4 since integer? T-2 <= floor(59/12) but inequality.\n\n12(T-2) <= 59, T-2 <= 59/12 = 4 + 11/12, so T-2 <= 4 if we take floor, but since 12*4=48<59, 12*5=60>59, so T-2 <= 4? Let's calculate:\n\n12(T-2) <= 59, so T-2 <= 59/12 = 4.916, since T-2 integer, T-2 <= 4.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -48 + 12(T-2) => 48 <= 12(T-2) => 12(T-2) >= 48 => T-2 >= 4.\n\nSo min <=0 <= max when T-2 <=4 and T-2 >=4, so T-2=4, T=6.\n\nAt T=6, min = -59 +12(4) = -59+48= -11 <=0, max= -48+48=0, so 0 in [-11,0], yes.\n\nFor other T, not both satisfied.\n\nNow second car on freeway 2: (24,13,right,12), head 24, tail 13, so at T, span = [13 +12(T-2), 24 +12(T-2)] = [12(T-2)+13, 12(T-2)+24]\n\nMin =12(T-2)+13, max=12(T-2)+24\n\nBoth min and max increase with T.\n\nMin at T=2: 12(0)+13=13>0, so for all T>=2, min >=13>0, so 0 not in span. No collision from this car.\n\nSo for freeway 2, only possible collision at T=6 from first car.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"3 | \\((-48, -59, right, 12), (24, 13, right, 12)\\)\"\n\nIdentical to freeway 2, so also only collision possible at T=6 from first car.\n\nNow freeway 4: \"4 | \\((-24, 11, left, 36)\\)\" one car.\n\nLeft-moving: (h, tau, d, s) = (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nFor left-moving, span at t_1: [h, tau] = [-24, 11]? But h is head, tau tail, moving left, so head should be left if left is negative, but span [h,tau] with h=-24, tau=11, so from -24 to 11.\n\nAt time T, span = [h - s(T-t_1), tau - s(T-t_1)] = [-24 -36(T-2), 11 -36(T-2)]\n\nSet min = -24 -36(T-2), max = 11 -36(T-2)\n\n0 in [min,max] if min <=0 <= max\n\nFirst, min <=0: -24 -36(T-2) <=0 => -36(T-2) <=24 => multiply both sides by -1, reverse inequality: 36(T-2) >= -24? Better not multiply.\n\n-24 -36(T-2) <=0 => -36(T-2) <=24\n\nDivide by -36, reverse inequality: (T-2) >= 24/-36? 24/-36 = -2/3, so T-2 >= -2/3, which is always true since T-2 >=0.\n\n-36(T-2) <=24, divide both sides by -36, reverse: (T-2) >= 24 / (-36) = -24/36 = -2/3.\n\nSince T-2 integer >=0, T-2 >=0 > -2/3, so always true for T>=2.\n\nSecond, 0 <= max: 0 <= 11 -36(T-2) => 36(T-2) <=11 => T-2 <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so T-2 <= 0 since integer, T-2=0, T=2.\n\nAt T=2, max=11 -0 =11>0, min=-24<0, so 0 in span.\n\nFor T>2, T-2>=1, max=11-36<= -25<0, so 0 not <= max, so not in span.\n\nSo only at T=2, collision possible on freeway 4.\n\nBut at turn T, collision if I'm on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAt T=2, which is current turn, I'm at y=1, which is freeway 1? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=1 is freeway 1, y=2 is freeway 2, etc.\n\ny=1: freeway 1, y=2: freeway 2, ..., y=8: freeway 8.\n\nAt turn t_1=2, I'm at (0,1), so on freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 4 is y=4.\n\nAt T=2, on freeway 4, there is a car covering x=0, but I'm not on freeway 4, I'm on freeway 1, so no collision for me.\n\nAnd for future, no collision on freeway 4 except at T=2, which is past.\n\nSo freeway 4 safe for T>2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: \"5 | \\((-24, 11, left, 36)\\)\" same as freeway 4, so only collision at T=2, safe after.\n\nNow freeway 6: \"6 | \\((-36, -47, right, 6)\\)\" one car, right-moving.\n\nHead h=-36, tail tau=-47? So at t_1, span [tau, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt T, span = [-47 +6(T-2), -36 +6(T-2)]\n\nMin = -47 +6(T-2), max = -36 +6(T-2)\n\n0 in span if min <=0 <= max\n\nmin <=0: -47 +6(T-2) <=0 => 6(T-2) <=47 => T-2 <= 47/6 ≈7.833, so T-2 <=7\n\nmax >=0: -36 +6(T-2) >=0 => 6(T-2) >=36 => T-2 >=6\n\nSo T-2 >=6 and T-2 <=7, so T-2=6 or 7.\n\nAt T-2=6, T=8, min=-47+36= -11<=0, max=-36+36=0, so 0 in span.\n\nAt T-2=7, T=9, min=-47+42= -5<=0, max=-36+42=6>=0, so 0 in span.\n\nSo collisions on freeway 6 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (56,45,right,4), head 56, tail 45, so at T, span [45 +4(T-2), 56 +4(T-2)] = [4(T-2)+45, 4(T-2)+56]\n\nMin at T=2: 45>0, so all min >=45>0, no 0 in span.\n\nSecond car: (8,-3,right,4)? head 8, tail -3, so at T, span [-3 +4(T-2), 8 +4(T-2)] = [4(T-2)-3, 4(T-2)+8]\n\nMin =4(T-2)-3, max=4(T-2)+8\n\n0 in span if min <=0 <= max\n\nmin <=0: 4(T-2)-3 <=0 => 4(T-2) <=3 => T-2 <= 3/4=0.75, so T-2 <=0 since integer, T=2\n\nmax >=0: 4(T-2)+8 >=0 always since min at T=2 is -3<0? At T=2, max=8>0.\n\nAt T=2, min=4(0)-3=-3<=0, max=8>=0, so 0 in span.\n\nFor T>2, T-2>=1, min=4(1)-3=1>0? At T=3, min=4(1)-3=1>0, so not <=0, so only at T=2 possible collision.\n\nBut at T=2, on freeway 7, car covers x=0.\n\nBut I'm not on freeway 7 at T=2, I'm on y=1.\n\nSo safe for me.\n\nNow freeway 8: \"8 | \\((-42, -53, right, 3)\\)\" one car, right-moving.\n\nHead h=-42, tail tau=-53, so at T, span [-53 +3(T-2), -42 +3(T-2)]\n\nMin = -53 +3(T-2), max = -42 +3(T-2)\n\n0 in span if min <=0 <= max\n\nmin <=0: -53 +3(T-2) <=0 => 3(T-2) <=53 => T-2 <=53/3≈17.666, so T-2<=17\n\nmax >=0: -42 +3(T-2) >=0 => 3(T-2) >=42 => T-2 >=14\n\nSo T-2 from 14 to 17 inclusive.\n\nT-2=14,15,16,17\n\nT=16,17,18,19\n\nAt these times, collision on freeway 8 if I'm there.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=1 to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, no freeway, so no cars, but I need to be at (0,9), which is above freeway 8, I think y=9 is safe.\n\nThe grid is y=0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, no cars, always safe.\n\nBut I start at y=1, which is a freeway, and end at y=9, not a freeway.\n\nNow, the minimal number of turns: since I need to go from y=1 to y=9, the minimal vertical moves are 8 up moves, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions, so H could be more than 8.\n\nBut since I can stay or move, I need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 in min turns, avoiding being on a freeway y at turn T when there is a collision on that y at T.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway and each relevant turn when collision happens.\n\nDefine collision times:\n\nFreeway 1: no collision for T>=2\n\nFreeway 2: collision at T=6\n\nFreeway 3: collision at T=6\n\nFreeway 4: collision only at T=2, safe after\n\nFreeway 5: same, only T=2, safe after\n\nFreeway 6: collisions at T=8 and T=9\n\nFreeway 7: collision only at T=2, safe after\n\nFreeway 8: collisions at T=16,17,18,19\n\nT=16 to 19, which is far, since t_1=2, T=16 is 14 turns later, might not be relevant if I can reach faster.\n\nI start at turn 2, position y=1.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, D decreases, S same.\n\nI must not be on a freeway during collision times for that freeway.\n\nSpecifically, for each freeway, when there is a collision at time T, I should not be on that freeway at that exact T.\n\nNow, since I can move, I can be on different y at different times.\n\nLet me denote the turn from t=2 onwards.\n\nLet t be the turn number, starting from t=2.\n\nI need to find actions from t=2 to some t=2+H-1, such that at turn t=2+H-1, y=9.\n\nAnd for each turn tau from 2 to 2+H-2, I am at some y_tau, and if y_tau is between 1 and 8, it must not be a collision time for that freeway.\n\nAt turn tau, I am at y_tau, and I choose action a_tau, which determines y_{tau+1}.\n\nThe position y_tau is where I am during turn tau, so for collision check, at turn tau, I am on freeway y_tau, and we check if there is a car on that freeway with 0 in span at turn tau.\n\nThen, after action, I move to y_{tau+1} for turn tau+1.\n\nThe goal is at the turn when I reach y=9, I don't need to be on a freeway, so no collision check.\n\nNow, minimal H: since y=1 to y=9, min 8 up moves, so H at least 8, meaning from t=2 to t=9, I go to y=9 at t=9.\n\nBut I might need to take more turns if I have to wait.\n\nBut let's see if I can do it in 8 turns, i.e., from t=2 to t=9, with y at t=9 being 9.\n\nStart at t=2, y=1.\n\nAfter action at t=2, y_3 = y_2 + delta y, and so on.\n\nLet me define the state at each turn.\n\nTurn t: I am at y_t, then I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y.\n\nFor collision at turn t, it depends on y_t and the cars on freeway y_t at time t.\n\nNow, for t=2: I am at y=1, freeway 1. At t=2, is there collision on freeway 1? Earlier, for freeway 1, no collision for T>=2, so safe. I can be there.\n\nNow, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut there are obstacles at certain times.\n\nList collision times per freeway:\n\ny=1: no collision, all t\n\ny=2: collision at t=6\n\ny=3: collision at t=6\n\ny=4: collision only at t=2, but at t=2 I am not on y=4, and for t>2 no collision, so safe for t>2\n\nSimilarly y=5: same, only t=2 collision, safe for t>2\n\ny=6: collisions at t=8 and t=9\n\ny=7: collision only at t=2, safe after\n\ny=8: collisions at t=16,17,18,19, which are late, so for early times, safe.\n\nNow, since I start at t=2, y=1, and want to reach y=9 quickly, I should go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on y=2 or y=3 at t=6, and on y=6 at t=8 or t=9.\n\ny=6 has collision at t=8 and t=9.\n\nt=8 and t=9 are turns where if I am on y=6, I collide.\n\nNow, let's think about the timeline.\n\nCurrent turn t=2, y=1.\n\nI can go up to y=2 at t=3, or stay, or down, but down to y=0 is possible, but y=0 is safe, no freeway.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nMinimal path: go up every turn.\n\nSo actions: U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U to go from y=1 to y=9 in 8 moves, so from t=2 to t=9, y_t: t=2:y=1, t=3:y=2, t=4:y=3, t=5:y=4, t=6:y=5, t=7:y=6, t=8:y=7, t=9:y=8, but at t=9, y=8, not 9. Let's see:\n\nStart t=2, y=1\n\nAfter a_2, y_3 = y_2 + delta y_2\n\nIf I do U at t=2, y_3 =1+1=2\n\nAt t=3, y=2\n\nIf U at t=3, y_4=3\n\nt=4, y=3, U, y_5=4\n\nt=5, y=4, U, y_6=5\n\nt=6, y=5, U, y_7=6\n\nt=7, y=6, U, y_8=7\n\nt=8, y=7, U, y_9=8\n\nt=9, y=8, U, y_10=9\n\nThen at t=10, y=9, so I reach at turn t=10.\n\nTurns: from t=2 to t=10, that's 9 actions: actions at t=2 to t=9, for H=8? Let's clarify.\n\nThe sequence: I start at turn t_1=2 with position (0,y_{t_1}) = (0,1)\n\nI take actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}, so actions from t=2 to t=2+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t=2+H-1 + something? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, before action, I am at y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, I move to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nI take action at turn t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nThe last action is at turn t=2+H-1, which sets y_{2+H}.\n\nAnd I need y_{2+H} =9.\n\nAt turn t=2+H, I am at y=9, and since it's the position after last action, and turn t=2+H, but for collision, only during turns when I am on freeway, but y=9 no freeway, so no issue.\n\nNow, the number of actions is H, from t=2 to t=2+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t=2+H with y=9.\n\nFor example, minimal if I go up every turn: start y_2=1\n\na_2=U, y_3=2\n\na_3=U, y_4=3\n\na_4=U, y_5=4\n\na_5=U, y_6=5\n\na_6=U, y_7=6\n\na_7=U, y_8=7\n\na_8=U, y_9=8\n\na_9=U, y_10=9\n\nSo at turn t=10, y=9. Actions from t=2 to t=9, that's 8 actions, H=8.\n\nt=2 to t=9 inclusive is 8 turns for actions, but the position is updated after action.\n\nTurn t=2: position y_2=1, I take action a_2\n\nThen at turn t=3, I am at y_3, and so on.\n\nAfter action at t=9, y_10=9.\n\nSo I reach at turn t=10.\n\nH=8 actions.\n\nNow, in this sequence, let's check collisions.\n\nAt each turn t, y_t:\n\nt=2: y=1, freeway 1, no collision, safe\n\nt=3: y=2, freeway 2, collision at t=6, but t=3≠6, and no other collision times for y=2 except t=6, so safe\n\nt=4: y=3, freeway 3, collision only at t=6, t=4≠6, safe\n\nt=5: y=4, freeway 4, no collision for t>2, safe\n\nt=6: y=5, freeway 5, no collision for t>2, safe\n\nt=7: y=6, freeway 6, collision at t=8 and t=9, t=7 not 8 or 9, so safe? At t=7, y=6, is there collision? Freeway 6 has collision at t=8 and t=9, not t=7, so safe at t=7.\n\nt=8: y=7, freeway 7, no collision for t>2, safe\n\nt=9: y=8, freeway 8, collision at t=16,17,18,19, t=9 not in, safe\n\nThen t=10: y=9, goal, no freeway.\n\nIn this sequence, all turns are safe? But at t=7, y=6, and freeway 6 collision only at t=8 and t=9, so t=7 is fine.\n\nThen at t=8, y=7, safe.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nIn this, at t=10 I am at y=9.\n\nBut is there a problem at t=8 or t=9 with y=6? No, at t=7 I am on y=6, but collision at t=8 and t=9 on y=6.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=7, y=6, no collision.\n\nThen a_7=U, so y_8=7 at turn t=8.\n\nAt t=8, y=7, not 6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, a_8=U, y_9=8 at turn t=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=8, not 6.\n\nSo y=6 is occupied at t=7, but collision only at t=8 and t=9, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, for y=2 and y=3, collision at t=6, but in the sequence, at t=6, I am at y=5, not y=2 or 3.\n\nAt t=6, y=5.\n\nSo in this direct up path, all safe, and I reach in 8 actions, to turn t=10.\n\nBut let me confirm the collision times.\n\nFreeway 6: collision at t=8 and t=9.\n\nIn the sequence, when is y=6? At turn t=7, y=7? No.\n\nt=2: y=1\n\nt=3: y=2\n\nt=4: y=3\n\nt=5: y=4\n\nt=6: y=5\n\nt=7: y=6\n\nt=8: y=7\n\nt=9: y=8\n\nt=10: y=9\n\nSo at t=7, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nCollision on freeway 6 at t=8 and t=9, not t=7. So at t=7, no collision, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, y=7, freeway 7, no collision for t>2, safe.\n\nt=9, y=8, freeway 8, collision only at t=16-19, not now, safe.\n\nSo yes, all good.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which I do at t=10.\n\nBut is there a way to reach faster? From y=1 to y=9, I need at least 8 up moves, so 8 actions are minimal, so H=8 is the minimum.\n\nIn the actions, I have 8 U's.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nBut the car states might be wrong, or did I miss something?\n\nFreeway 2 and 3 have collision at t=6.\n\nIn the path, at t=6, I am at y=5, not y=2 or 3.\n\ny=5 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster? But 8 is minimal.\n\nUnless I start from higher, but I start at y=1.\n\nAnother thing: at the beginning, at t=2, y=1, I can choose to stay or down, but that would take more turns, not faster.\n\nSo H=8 should be achievable.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 6 collision times.\n\nFreeway 6: car (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nAt T, span = [-47 +6(T-2), -36 +6(T-2)]\n\nFor T=8: T-2=6, min=-47+36= -11, max=-36+36=0, so span [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nFor T=9: T-2=7, min=-47+42= -5, max=-36+42=6, includes 0.\n\nFor T=7: T-2=5, min=-47+30= -17, max=-36+30= -6, both negative, 0 not in [-17,-6], so no.\n\nT=10: min=-47+48=1>0, no.\n\nSo only t=8 and t=9.\n\nIn the sequence, y=6 at t=7, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=8, y=7, not 6.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nTherefore, I can go directly up with all U.\n\nActions: from turn t=2 to t=9, all U.\n\nThen at turn t=10, y=9.\n\nBut the sequence should be actions at t=2 to t=9.\n\nAnswer format: for each turn, the action.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nAnd H=8.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but H is the number of actions, I think.\n\nIn the task: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions from t_1 + 0 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nSo for t_1=2, actions at t=2 to t=2+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn this case, H=8, actions at t=2 to t=9, position at t=10 is (0,9).\n\nBut is there a way with H=7? That would mean from y=1 to y=9 in 7 actions, but each action changes y by at most 1, so minimum 8 changes to increase by 8, so impossible in less than 8 actions. So H=8 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 earlier if I start higher, but I start at y=1.\n\nOr if I go down first, but that would make it slower.\n\nSo H=8 is minimal and achievable.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 2 and 3, at t=6 collision, but I am not there.\n\nAnother thing: the player position is given at (0, y_{t_1}), and at turn t_1, I am already there, so for collision at t_1, it is checked, but on freeway 1, no collision, so fine.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut let me see if all freeways are covered.\n\nFreeway 7: at t=2, collision, but I am not on y=7 at t=2.\n\nIn the path, I am on y=7 at t=8, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the problem has multiple cars on some freeways, but I think I handled.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 6, at t=8 and t=9, but I avoid being there.\n\nIn my sequence, I am never on y=6 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nAt t=7, y=6, safe; then move up.\n\nSo should be ok.\n\nPerhaps I can go slower to avoid, but no need.\n\nSo the sequence should be all U from turn 2 to 9.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n}\n\nWith H=8.\n\nBut the box should contain the actions per turn.\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nt_1=2.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 9: U\n\nAnd that's 8 lines.\n\nBut H=8, actions from t=2 to t=9.\n\nPerhaps I need to specify H, but in the answer, it's in the sequence.\n\nThe task says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\"\n\nBut in the answer format, it only shows the sequence, so H is implied by the number of actions.\n\nSince it says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so in the box, we list the actions for each turn.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there any constraint that I missed?\n\nThe vertical axis y=0 to 9, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so I can go to y=0, but not necessary.\n\nIn this case, no need.\n\nPerhaps at some point I need to wait to avoid, but here no need.\n\nAnother thing: for freeway 8, collisions at t=16-19, but I am on y=8 at t=9, which is fine.\n\nt=9 is before 16.\n\nSo all good.\n\nI think this should be the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) is 8. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) at every turn from turn 2 to turn 9, resulting in the player reaching y=9 at turn 10.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Justification:\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: No collision at any turn \\(T \\geq 2\\). At turn 2, the player is on freeway 1 and safe.\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Collision occurs only at turn 6. The player is on freeway 2 at turn 3, which is safe.\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Collision occurs only at turn 6. The player is on freeway 3 at turn 4, which is safe.\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Collision occurs only at turn 2. For turns \\(T > 2\\), no collision. The player is on freeway 4 at turn 5, which is safe.\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Collision occurs only at turn 2. For turns \\(T > 2\\), no collision. The player is on freeway 5 at turn 6, which is safe.\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Collisions occur at turns 8 and 9. The player is on freeway 6 at turn 7, which is safe (no collision at turn 7).\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Collision occurs only at turn 2. For turns \\(T > 2\\), no collision. The player is on freeway 7 at turn 8, which is safe.\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Collisions occur at turns 16, 17, 18, and 19. The player is on freeway 8 at turn 9, which is before the collision times and thus safe.\n\nThe sequence of actions ensures the player moves directly upward without delay, avoiding all collision points. Since the player starts at y=1 and needs to reach y=9, a minimum of 8 upward moves is required, and this sequence achieves that in \\(H=8\\) actions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,2) at turn t1=3 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Importantly, when you move to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, you're on y at turn T, and on y+1 at turn T+1. So you only check for collision on the row you're currently on at each turn.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=3, and I need to find where they are at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway at t1=3:\n\n- Freeway 1 (y=1): one car: head 96, tail 49, direction right, speed 48. Since it's right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [49, 96]? Direction is right, so head is at higher x, tail at lower? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: span at t1 is [τ, h], meaning τ is left end, h is right end? The notation says: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], and at time T, it becomes [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ], and at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)].\n\nIn the freeway 1 entry: (96, 49, right, 48). It says \"head h, tail τ\", but for right-moving, if it's moving right, head should be the front, so for right-moving, head h is larger than tail τ, I think. Let's confirm.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span is [h, τ], which suggests h is head, τ is tail, and since it's left-moving, head is at left? I'm a bit confused.\n\nLook at the update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSo for left-moving, [h, τ] with h and τ such that when moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ and h such that when moving right, both increase.\n\nIn terms of position, for a car, the span covers from min to max coordinate.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (96, 49, right, 48). Since right-moving, span at t1=3 is [τ, h] = [49, 96]. So it occupies x from 49 to 96 at t=3.\n\nAs time increases, since right-moving, the span shifts right: at time T, span is [49 + 48(T-3), 96 + 48(T-3)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway k at turn T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\n0 is the x-position where the player is, since player is always at x=0.\n\nPlayer is at (0, y_t), so x=0 always, only y changes.\n\nSo for a given freeway k and turn T, if y_T = k, and 0 is in the span of any car on freeway k at turn T, then collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=2 at t=3 to y=9, with minimal turns.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so minimum moves is 7, since from 2 to 9 is 7 steps up, but I might need to stay or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 7.\n\nBut since I can only move to adjacent rows, and I start at 2, need to reach 9, so I must increase y by 7 net, but with possible downs or stays, so the sequence might have more than 7 actions.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H-1, y=9.\n\nTurn t1 is when we start, position (0, y_{t1}) = (0,2).\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, we go to y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and after H actions, at time t1+H, we have y_{t1+H}.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T, before action a_T.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, player is at position (0, y_t).\n\nThen we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at (0, y_{t+1}), and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn t when we are on y_t, for the cars on that row at that turn.\n\nSo for turn t, if y_t = k, and for freeway k, at turn t, 0 is in the span of some car, then collision.\n\nNow, we start at turn t1=3, y_3 = 2.\n\nWe need to find actions a_3, a_4, ..., up to some a_{3+H-1} such that after H actions, at turn t=3+H, y_{3+H} = 9.\n\nAnd during the sequence, for each turn t from 3 to 3+H-1, no collision when on y_t.\n\nAt turn t=3+H, we are at y_{3+H}=9, and we don't care about collision at t=3+H for reaching (0,9), I think, because the goal is to reach (0,9), which means being at y=9 at some turn, and we need to be there without crashing on the way.\n\nThe collision is only checked when we are on the freeway, so at turn when y_t=k for k=1 to 8, we check for collision.\n\nAt y=0 and y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible there. y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, y=9 is the top, no freeways, so only freeways 1 to 8 have cars.\n\nSo when on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nIn this case, start at y=2, which is freeway, need to go to y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, the path must avoid being on a freeway row when 0 is in a car span for that row and turn.\n\nSince we move one row per turn max, we can only be on consecutive rows.\n\nTo minimize H, we probably want to go up as fast as possible, but might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nH is the number of actions, so from t=3 to t=3+H, after H actions.\n\nStart at t=3, y=2.\n\nAfter a_3, at t=4, y= y_3 + Δy_3\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{3+H-1}, at t=3+H, y=9.\n\nSo we need y_{3+H} =9.\n\nThe actions are from t=3 to t=3+H-1, total H actions.\n\nFor turns t=3 to t=3+H-1, we are on y_t, and for each, if y_t between 1 and 8, must not collide with cars on that row at that turn.\n\nAt t=3+H, we are on y=9, which is safe, no check needed.\n\nNow, I need to simulate the car positions for each freeway over time, starting from t=3.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway at t=3.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): one car: head=96, tail=49, dir=right, speed=48\n\nSince right-moving, span at t=3: [τ, h] = [49, 96]\n\nAt time T, span: [49 + 48(T-3), 96 + 48(T-3)]\n\nCollision if 0 in [49 + 48ΔT, 96 + 48ΔT] for ΔT = T-3.\n\nSince the car is at high x, moving right, 0 is not in span for any T, because min x is 49 at T=3, increasing, so always positive, never near 0. So freeway 1 is always safe, no car near 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 (y=2): two cars: (-36, -47, right, 12) and (36, 25, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: dir right, span at t=3: [τ, h] = [-47, -36]? Head and tail.\n\nGiven as (head h, tail τ, dir, speed)\n\nFor first car: h=-36, τ=-47, dir right, speed 12\n\nSince right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt time T, [ -47 + 12(T-3), -36 + 12(T-3) ]\n\nSecond car: h=36, τ=25, dir right, speed 12, span [25, 36] at t=3, at T [25 + 12(T-3), 36 + 12(T-3)]\n\nNow, collision at freeway 2 if at turn T, 0 is in either span.\n\nFirst span: [ -47 + 12ΔT, -36 + 12ΔT ] where ΔT = T-3\n\nSet 0 in this interval: -47 + 12ΔT <= 0 <= -36 + 12ΔT\n\nSimilarly for second interval: 25 + 12ΔT <= 0 <= 36 + 12ΔT\n\nBut 25 to 36 is positive, so 0 cannot be in [25 +12ΔT, 36+12ΔT] since min is 25>0.\n\nSimilarly, for first interval, -47 +12ΔT <= 0 <= -36 +12ΔT\n\nSolve inequalities:\n\n-47 +12ΔT <= 0 => 12ΔT <= 47 => ΔT <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so ΔT <=3 since ΔT integer\n\n0 <= -36 +12ΔT => 12ΔT >=36 => ΔT >=3\n\nSo for ΔT=3, 0 in [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0], and 0 is included, so yes.\n\nΔT=3: -47 +36 = -11, -36+36=0, so [ -11, 0 ], and 0 is in it.\n\nFor ΔT=4: -47+48=1, -36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=2: -47+24= -23, -36+24= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at ΔT=3, i.e., T=3+3=6, for the first car, 0 in span.\n\nSecond car never, as min is 25>0.\n\nSo on freeway 2, collision at T=6 if player is on y=2.\n\nBut at T=6, if player on y=2, collision.\n\nNow, freeway 3 (y=3): cars same as freeway 2? Look.\n\nFreeway 3: (-36, -47, right, 12) and (36, 25, right, 12) — same as freeway 2?\n\nBut different row.\n\nAt t=3, for freeway 3, same cars? But positions might be different, but here listed same values, so probably same car config, but on row y=3.\n\nSo similarly, collision at T=6 for the first car.\n\nFirst car: same as above, at T=6, span [ -11, 0] on y=3? Freeway 3.\n\nAt turn T=6, if on y=3, collision.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nFor freeway 3, at T=6, ΔT=3, car1: [ -47 +12*3, -36+12*3] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], 0 in it.\n\nCar2: [25+36,36+36]=[61,72], not near 0.\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow freeway 4 (y=4): (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nLeft-moving, so span at t=3: [h, τ] = [-60, -25]? Head and tail.\n\nGiven (head h, tail τ, dir left, speed 36)\n\nFor left-moving, span is [h, τ], so here h=-60, τ=-25, so span [-60, -25] at t=3.\n\nAt time T, [ -60 -36(T-3), -25 -36(T-3) ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -60 -36ΔT, -25 -36ΔT ]\n\nSince both decreasing, and negative, min is more negative, max less negative.\n\n0 <= -25 -36ΔT? But -25 -36ΔT <= -25 <0, so never >=0, so 0 not in span ever, because the span is always negative, moving left. So no collision on freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 (y=5): same as freeway 4? (-60, -25, left, 36) — same, so also always safe.\n\nNow freeway 6 (y=6): (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nRight-moving, so (head h, tail τ) = (-30, -41)? h=-30, τ=-41, dir right.\n\nSpan [τ, h] = [-41, -30] at t=3.\n\nAt T, [ -41 +6(T-3), -30 +6(T-3) ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -41 +6ΔT, -30 +6ΔT ]\n\nSet -41 +6ΔT <= 0 <= -30 +6ΔT\n\nLeft: -41 +6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=41 => ΔT <=41/6≈6.833, so ΔT<=6\n\nRight: 0 <= -30 +6ΔT => 6ΔT >=30 => ΔT >=5\n\nSo for ΔT=5,6\n\nΔT=5: [ -41+30, -30+30] = [-11, 0], 0 in\n\nΔT=6: [ -41+36, -30+36] = [-5, 6], 0 in? -5 <=0<=6, yes.\n\nΔT=4: [ -41+24, -30+24] = [-17,-6], 0 not in\n\nΔT=7: [ -41+42, -30+42] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo collision at ΔT=5 and 6, i.e., T=8 and T=9.\n\nT=3 + ΔT, so T=8 and 9.\n\nNow freeway 7 (y=7): two cars: (60,49, right,4) and (12,1, right,4)\n\nFirst car: head=60, tail=49, dir right, speed 4, span [49,60] at t=3? Right-moving, span [τ,h] = [49,60]? τ=49, h=60.\n\nAt t=3, [49,60], at T [49 +4ΔT, 60+4ΔT], all positive, min 49>0, so never near 0. Safe.\n\nSecond car: (12,1, right,4), head=12, tail=1, dir right, span [1,12] at t=3, at T [1+4ΔT, 12+4ΔT], min 1>0, so always positive, never 0, safe. So freeway 7 always safe.\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): (-39, -50, right, 3)\n\nHead=-39, tail=-50, dir right, span [τ,h] = [-50, -39] at t=3.\n\nAt T, [ -50 +3ΔT, -39 +3ΔT ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -50 +3ΔT, -39 +3ΔT ]\n\nSet -50 +3ΔT <= 0 <= -39 +3ΔT\n\nLeft: -50 +3ΔT <=0 => 3ΔT <=50 => ΔT <=50/3≈16.666, ΔT<=16\n\nRight: 0 <= -39 +3ΔT => 3ΔT >=39 => ΔT >=13\n\nSo for ΔT=13 to 16 inclusive.\n\nΔT=13: [ -50+39, -39+39] = [-11, 0], 0 in\n\nΔT=14: [ -50+42, -39+42] = [-8,3], 0 in\n\nΔT=15: [ -50+45, -39+45] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔT=16: [ -50+48, -39+48] = [-2,9], 0 in\n\nΔT=17: [ -50+51, -39+51] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo collision on freeway 8 at T=16,17,18,19? T=3 + ΔT, so T=16,17,18,19 for ΔT=13,14,15,16.\n\nT=3+13=16, 17,18,19.\n\nNow, summarize unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: always safe\n\n- Freeway 2: unsafe at T=6 (only, from earlier)\n\n- Freeway 3: unsafe at T=6 (same as freeway 2)\n\n- Freeway 4: always safe\n\n- Freeway 5: always safe\n\n- Freeway 6: unsafe at T=8 and T=9\n\n- Freeway 7: always safe\n\n- Freeway 8: unsafe at T=16,17,18,19\n\nPlayer starts at t=3, y=2.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny must be integer, 0 to 9.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid the unsafe times on the rows.\n\nSince we move one step per turn, the position changes slowly.\n\nLet me denote the turn from t=3 onwards.\n\nAt t=3, y=2.\n\nFreeway 2 is unsafe only at t=6.\n\nBut we are on y=2 at t=3, which is freeway 2, but at t=3, is it unsafe?\n\nFor freeway 2 at t=3: ΔT=0, car1: [-47, -36], not contain 0. Car2: [25,36], not. So safe at t=3.\n\nUnsafe only at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 unsafe at t=6.\n\nNow, since we start at y=2 at t=3, we need to choose actions to move up.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up every turn, so y_t = 2 + (t-3) for t=3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\n\nAt t=3, y=2\n\nAfter U, t=4, y=3\n\nAfter U, t=5, y=4\n\nAfter U, t=6, y=5\n\nBut at t=6, if y=5, freeway 5, which is always safe, as we saw.\n\nBut let's list:\n\nt=3: y=2, freeway 2, safe? At t=3, freeway 2 safe, as above.\n\nt=4: if we go up to y=3, on freeway 3 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, freeway 3: ΔT=1, car1: [ -47+12(1), -36+12(1)] = [-35,-24], not 0. Car2: [25+12,36+12]=[37,48], not 0. Safe.\n\nt=5: y=4, freeway 4, always safe.\n\nt=6: y=5, freeway 5, always safe.\n\nt=7: y=6, freeway 6.\n\nAt t=7, freeway 6: ΔT=4, car: [ -41 +6*4, -30 +6*4] = [-41+24, -30+24] = [-17,-6], not contain 0, safe. Unsafe only at t=8 and 9.\n\nt=8: y=7, freeway 7, always safe.\n\nt=9: y=8, freeway 8.\n\nAt t=9, freeway 8: ΔT=6, span [ -50 +3*6, -39 +3*6] = [-50+18, -39+18] = [-32,-21], not contain 0. Unsafe starts at t=16, far away.\n\nt=10: y=9, reached.\n\nSo if we go up every turn from t=3 to t=9, actions U,U,U,U,U,U,U? Let's see the turns.\n\nStart t=3, y=2\n\nAction a_3: U, then t=4, y=3\n\na_4: U, t=5, y=4\n\na_5: U, t=6, y=5\n\na_6: U, t=7, y=6\n\na_7: U, t=8, y=7\n\na_8: U, t=9, y=8\n\na_9: U, t=10, y=9\n\nNow, at each turn, we need to check if safe when on that row.\n\nt=3: y=2, freeway 2, at t=3 safe\n\nt=4: y=3, freeway 3, at t=4 safe (as above)\n\nt=5: y=4, freeway 4 safe\n\nt=6: y=5, freeway 5 safe\n\nt=7: y=6, freeway 6, at t=7: ΔT=4, span [-17,-6] not 0, safe\n\nt=8: y=7, freeway 7 safe\n\nt=9: y=8, freeway 8, at t=9: ΔT=6, [-32,-21] not 0, safe\n\nThen at t=10, y=9, safe, no freeway.\n\nSo in 7 actions, we reach y=9 at t=10.\n\nH=7 actions: from a_3 to a_9, that's 7 actions? t from 3 to 9 inclusive, that's 7 turns: t=3,4,5,6,7,8,9 for actions.\n\nAfter a_9 at t=9, we go to y=10? No.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t=3, y_3=2, after a_3, y_4 = y_3 + Δy.\n\nAfter last action at t=3+H-1, y_{3+H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\n- At t=3: y=2, action U, so y_4=3\n\n- t=4: y=3, action U, y_5=4\n\n- t=5: y=4, action U, y_6=5\n\n- t=6: y=5, action U, y_7=6\n\n- t=7: y=6, action U, y_8=7\n\n- t=8: y=7, action U, y_9=8\n\n- t=9: y=8, action U, y_10=9\n\nSo at t=10, y=9, reached.\n\nActions from t=3 to t=9, that's 7 actions: a_3 to a_9.\n\nNow, during turns t=3 to t=9, we are on rows:\n\nt=3: y=2, safe\n\nt=4: y=3, safe\n\nt=5: y=4, safe\n\nt=6: y=5, safe\n\nt=7: y=6, safe (as per above)\n\nt=8: y=7, safe\n\nt=9: y=8, safe\n\nAll safe, and we reached in min possible turns, since 7 steps up.\n\nBut is t=7 safe on y=6? Freeway 6 at t=7.\n\nt=7, ΔT=4, since t=3 is reference, ΔT= T-3=4 for T=7.\n\nFreeway 6 car: [ -41 +6*4, -30 +6*4] = [-41+24, -30+24] = [-17,-6], yes not contain 0.\n\nSimilarly, t=8 on y=7, safe.\n\nt=9 on y=8, ΔT=6, freeway 8: [ -50 +3*6, -39 +3*6] = [-50+18, -39+18] = [-32,-21], not 0.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut earlier I thought freeway 6 unsafe at t=8 and 9, but at t=8 and 9, if on y=6, unsafe, but in this path, at t=8, we are on y=7, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly, t=9 on y=8.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, we can go directly up in 7 turns.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point it might be unsafe, but seems not.\n\nFreeway 2 unsafe at t=6, but at t=6, we are on y=5, not y=2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 unsafe at t=6, but at t=6, we are on y=5.\n\nIn this path, at t=6, y=5.\n\nt=6: y=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\nOnly if we were on y=2 or y=3 at t=6, unsafe, but we are not.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 unsafe at t=8 and t=9, but at t=8, we are on y=7, at t=9 on y=8, not on y=6.\n\nSo all clear.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=7, with all actions U.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut in the output, it should be for turns starting from t_1=3.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U (since a_3)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} = a_4 = U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 +6: a_{t_1 +6} = a_9 = U\n\nt_1=3, t from 0 to H-1=6, so t_1 + t for t=0 to 6.\n\nIn the sequence, it's {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t_1 +0} = a_3\n\nt=1, a_4\n\n...\n\nt=6, a_{9}\n\nActions: all U.\n\nBut let me write the output.\n\nThe problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case, H=7.\n\nBut is there a reason to take more turns? Probably not, since we can go directly.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we stay or go down, it would take more turns, so H larger, not minimal.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 2 and 3, it says \"(-36, -47, right, 12)\" but head and tail, for right-moving, head should be the end in direction, but in the span, for right-moving, it's [τ, h] with τ left, h right, so in this case, for (-36, -47), if h=-36, τ=-47, then since right, left end τ=-47, right end h=-36, so from x=-47 to -36, which is left of 0, moving right.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nAnd we covered.\n\nPerhaps I should list the unsafe times again:\n\n- y=2: unsafe only at t=6\n\n- y=3: unsafe only at t=6\n\n- y=6: unsafe at t=8 and t=9\n\n- y=8: unsafe at t=16,17,18,19 (but far, not relevant since we reach early)\n\nOthers always safe.\n\nIn our path, we never on y=2 at t=6, nor y=3 at t=6, nor y=6 at t=8 or9.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 7 actions.\n\nBut H=7, actions from t=3 to t=9.\n\nOutput format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n}\n\nBut turn labels: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so Turn 3: U, Turn 4: U, ..., Turn 9: U.\n\nt_1=3, so Turn 3, Turn 4, ..., Turn 9.\n\nThat's 7 turns.\n\nSince t_1=3, and H=7, turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1 = 3 to 3+6=9, yes.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be written as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  (which is a_3)\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1} (a_4)\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 + 6: a_{t_1 +6} (a_9)\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut in the output, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so probably with the numbers.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nAnother thing: in the car for freeway 7, it has two cars, but both safe, as positions positive.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nI think this is correct.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,2), which is freeway 2, at t=3, and we said safe, which is true.\n\nThen move up each turn.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if at some point we need to avoid, but in this case, no need.\n\nSo minimal H=7.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and in this case 7.\n\nBut just to make sure, is there a way with H=6? From y=2 to y=9, difference 7, so at least 7 moves up, so H at least 7. If I do some down or stay, H larger, so 7 is minimum.\n\nThus, the sequence is all U.\n\nSo output.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) is 7. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) at each turn to increase the y-coordinate by 1 per turn, reaching y=9 after 7 actions.\n\nThe car configurations and their movements have been analyzed to ensure no collisions occur during the sequence:\n- Freeway 1 (y=1): Always safe, as the car span is always positive and moving away from x=0.\n- Freeway 2 (y=2): Unsafe only at turn 6, but the player is not on y=2 at turn 6 in this sequence.\n- Freeway 3 (y=3): Unsafe only at turn 6, but the player is not on y=3 at turn 6.\n- Freeway 4 (y=4) and Freeway 5 (y=5): Always safe, as car spans are always negative and moving away from x=0.\n- Freeway 6 (y=6): Unsafe at turns 8 and 9, but the player is not on y=6 at these turns.\n- Freeway 7 (y=7): Always safe, as car spans are always positive.\n- Freeway 8 (y=8): Unsafe at turns 16-19, but these are beyond the sequence duration.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 3, y=2 (safe), action U moves to y=3 at turn 4.\n- At turn 4, y=3 (safe), action U moves to y=4 at turn 5.\n- At turn 5, y=4 (safe), action U moves to y=5 at turn 6.\n- At turn 6, y=5 (safe), action U moves to y=6 at turn 7.\n- At turn 7, y=6 (safe at turn 7), action U moves to y=7 at turn 8.\n- At turn 8, y=7 (safe), action U moves to y=8 at turn 9.\n- At turn 9, y=8 (safe at turn 9), action U moves to y=9 at turn 10.\n\nAt turn 10, y=9 is reached, which is safe as it has no cars. The sequence avoids all collision points, and \\(H=7\\) is minimal since at least 7 up moves are required to increase y from 2 to 9.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 4, and I'm at y=3.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move because I need to avoid them when I'm on their freeway at the same turn.\n\nThe car positions are given for turn t_1=4, and they move at constant speeds. For left-moving cars, the span decreases in position over time, and for right-moving, it increases. But the key point is that a collision happens only if at turn T, when I'm on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, note that when I move, I'm not on the new freeway until the next turn. So if I move up or down at turn T, I'm still on y_T for that turn, and I move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nThe player position update: at turn t, I'm at (0, y_t), and I choose an action a_t which changes y for the next turn.\n\nSo at turn t, after choosing a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on U, D, S.\n\nThen, at turn t, I'm on freeway y_t, and I need that for freeway y_t, no car has 0 in its span at turn t.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t+1, I'm on y_{t+1}, so I need no car on that freeway has 0 in span at turn t+1, and so on.\n\nThe collision condition is only checked when I am on a freeway at a specific turn.\n\nNow, I start at turn 4, y=3.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is the top, I think y=9 is the goal, since it says reach (0,9), and y=0 to 9, so 9 rows.\n\ny=0 and y=9 might be safe, no cars, since cars are on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe problem says: avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1, ..., 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, I assume.\n\nAlso, for y=9, since no cars, I just need to be there, no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly for y=0.\n\nBut I start at y=3, which has cars? Let's see the car states.\n\nThe car states are given per freeway k.\n\nk is the freeway number, so y=1 to 8.\n\nFor each, it lists cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nNow, for freeway k=3, which is y=3? Freeway k, I think k is the y-coordinate, since it says freeway i, and i from 1 to 8.\n\nIn the table, it says Freeway k, and k from 1 to 8, so k=1 is y=1, k=2 is y=2, etc., up to k=8 for y=8.\n\nAnd for each, it has one or more cars.\n\nNow, for y=3 at turn t=4, what are the cars?\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 3: cars: (-24, -35, right, 12) and (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nDirection: right or left.\n\nFor right-moving, head and tail: it says (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor the first car on freeway 3: head = -24, tail = -35, direction right.\n\nBut for right-moving cars, the span is [tail, head] or [head, tail]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h] with τ and h, so for right-moving, τ is the tail and h is the head, so the span is from tail to head, increasing.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h head, τ tail, decreasing.\n\nNow for freeway 3, both cars are right-moving.\n\nFirst car: head = -24, tail = -35, but for right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nAt turn t_1=4.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (48, 37, right, 12), but head=48, tail=37? That seems odd because if it's right-moving, tail should be less than head? 37 to 48, but 37 < 48, so [37, 48]?\n\nLet's read: (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor right-moving, span is [τ, h], so if τ < h, it's fine.\n\nIn this case, first car: τ = -35, h = -24, so τ < h, span [-35, -24]\n\nSecond car: τ=37, h=48, so [37,48]\n\nBoth at turn 4.\n\nNow, for a collision at turn T on freeway y, if there is a car such that 0 is in [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] for right-moving, or [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)] for left-moving.\n\nSince t_1=4, let τ = T - t_1, the turns after.\n\nSet δt = T - t_1, so at time T, which is turn T, the span for a car at t_1 is moved by s * (T - t_1) = s * δt.\n\nFor right-moving, new span [τ + s δt, h + s δt]\n\nFor left-moving, [h - s δt, τ - s δt]\n\nCollision if 0 in that interval for the freeway I am on at turn T.\n\nNow, since I start at turn 4, y=3, and I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=3 to y=9, difference of 6, so minimum turns if I go up every time, but I might have to wait or detour due to cars.\n\nBut y=9 has no cars, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so when I am at y=9 at some turn, I have reached, and I don't need to do anything after that.\n\nThe sequence should end when I first reach y=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, for H turns, from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1, so actions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to t_1 + H -1, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y should be 9.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nAt turn t, I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t_1=4, I am at y_{t_1} = y_4 = 3.\n\nThen I choose a_4, which sets y_5 = y_4 + Δy.\n\nThen at turn 5, I am at y_5, and so on.\n\nI need to find H such that after H actions, y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nAfter H actions, I have applied actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, so the position at turn t_1 + H is y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nAnd H is the number of turns from start to reach.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1 relative, but since t_1 is given, it's from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nNow, I need to avoid collision at each turn t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, when I am on y_t.\n\nAt turn t, I am on freeway y_t, and for that freeway, no car should have 0 in its span at turn t.\n\nFor the freeway I am on at time t.\n\nNow, since I start at t=4, y=3, and I need to go to y=9.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway k, the cars and their positions over time.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, I need to find when 0 is covered for each freeway at each turn.\n\nBut turns are discrete, so for each turn T, and for each freeway, I can compute if there is a car such that 0 is in the span at T.\n\nBut for a given freeway, there might be multiple cars, so I need to check all for that row.\n\nAlso, the car positions depend on T.\n\nLet me define δt = T - 4, since t_1=4.\n\nSo for turn T, δt = T - 4.\n\nFor each freeway, at turn T, the occupied positions.\n\nBut I only care about whether 0 is occupied at T for the freeway I am on.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): one car: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so span at t_1=4: [τ, h] = [-95, -48]? τ = -95, h = -48, so [ -95, -48 ]\n\nThen at turn T, span [ -95 + 48 δt, -48 + 48 δt ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -95 + 48 δt, -48 + 48 δt ]\n\nSo -95 + 48 δt <= 0 <= -48 + 48 δt\n\nSolve:\n\nFirst inequality: -95 + 48 δt <= 0 => 48 δt <= 95 => δt <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 48 δt => 48 δt >= 48 => δt >= 1\n\nSo for δt >=1 and δt <= 1.979, so δt =1 or δt=2? δt must be integer since turns are discrete.\n\nδt = T-4, T integer.\n\nδt >=1 and δt <= 1.979, so δt=1 or 2? 1.979, so δt=1 only? δt=1: 48*1=48, -95+48= -47? Let's calculate.\n\nAt δt=1: T=5, span [ -95 +48*1, -48 +48*1] = [ -95+48, -48+48] = [-47, 0]\n\n0 is included, since -47 <= 0 <= 0.\n\n[ -47, 0 ] includes 0.\n\nAt δt=2: T=6, [ -95 +96, -48+96] = [1, 48], 1 to 48, 0 not in, since 0<1.\n\nAt δt=0: T=4, [ -95, -48], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo for y=1, collision at T=5 only, when δt=1.\n\nNow freeway 2 (y=2): cars: (-24, -35, right, 12) and (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: right, τ=-35, h=-24, span at T: [ -35 +12 δt, -24 +12 δt ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -35 +12 δt, -24 +12 δt ]\n\nSo -35 +12 δt <= 0 <= -24 +12 δt\n\nLeft: -35 +12 δt <=0 => 12 δt <=35 => δt <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916\n\nRight: 0 <= -24 +12 δt => 12 δt >=24 => δt >=2\n\nSo δt >=2 and δt <=2.916, so δt=2 or 3? δt=2: 12*2=24, -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0], includes 0.\n\nδt=3: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nδt=1: -35+12= -23, -24+12= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo collision at δt=2, T=6.\n\nSecond car on y=2: (48,37,right,12) τ=37, h=48, span [37+12δt, 48+12δt]\n\nAt δt=0, [37,48], all positive, 0 not in.\n\nAs δt increases, it moves right, so min is 37+12δt >0 for δt>=0, so 0 never in span. So safe for this car.\n\nSo for y=2, only collision at T=6 due to first car.\n\nNow freeway 3 (y=3): cars similar to y=2, same cars? (-24,-35,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nFirst car: same as above, [ -35 +12 δt, -24 +12 δt]\n\nCollision when δt=2, T=6, [ -35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nSecond car: [37+12δt,48+12δt], always >0, no collision.\n\nSo y=3 has collision at T=6.\n\nAt T=4, δt=0, [ -35, -24] and [37,48], 0 not in, so at start turn 4, y=3 is safe, which is good.\n\nBut at T=6, it will be unsafe.\n\nNow freeway 4 (y=4): car (48,83,left,36)\n\nDirection left, so at t_1, span [h, τ] = [48,83]? For left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ] with h head, τ tail.\n\nHere h=48, τ=83, but that would be [48,83], and since left-moving, it decreases.\n\nBut typically, for left-moving, head should be greater than tail? If moving left, head is left, tail right, so position decreasing.\n\nIn the span, [h, τ] with h > τ? Let's see.\n\nIn the rule: for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s δt, τ - s δt]\n\nAnd since it's moving left, the values decrease.\n\nNow, h and τ, which is head and tail.\n\nIn the car, it's given as (head, tail, ...), so for left-moving, h is head, τ is tail.\n\nIn this case, h=48, τ=83, so if h=48, τ=83, but 48 < 83, so [48,83] but since moving left, head at 48, tail at 83? That doesn't make sense because if moving left, head should be at higher position initially, then decreases.\n\nPerhaps I misinterpreted.\n\nLet me think: for a car moving left, at time t_1, head is at position h, tail at position τ, with h > τ, since moving left, head is left, tail right.\n\nBut here, for freeway 4, (48,83,left,36), h=48, τ=83, but 48 < 83, so if h=48, τ=83, then τ > h, so the span [h, τ] = [48,83], but if moving left, the head should be at 83 and tail at 48? I think there's confusion.\n\nLook back at the car update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd it says \"head at h, tail at τ\", but in which order?\n\nIn the right-moving case, it's clear: [τ, h] with τ tail, h head, τ < h.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h head, τ tail, but for left-moving, head should be greater than tail, so h > τ.\n\nIn this car, h=48, τ=83, 48 < 83, so τ > h, which is inconsistent if head is left.\n\nPerhaps for left-moving, h is the head position, which is larger, but here 48 < 83, so maybe it's a mistake, or perhaps the coordinates are such that left is negative, but in the span, it's the position value.\n\nLet's see the values.\n\nAt t_1, for this car, span [48,83], and moving left, so at later T, [48 - 36 δt, 83 - 36 δt]\n\nNow, collision if 0 in [48 - 36 δt, 83 - 36 δt]\n\n48 - 36 δt <= 0 <= 83 - 36 δt\n\nFirst: 48 - 36 δt <=0 => 48 <= 36 δt => δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333\n\nSecond: 0 <= 83 - 36 δt => 36 δt <=83 => δt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSo δt >= 1.333 and δt <= 2.305, so δt=2 only, since integer.\n\nδt=2: T=6, [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11], which includes 0? -24 <= 0 <= 11, yes.\n\nδt=1: T=5, [48-36, 83-36] = [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nδt=3: T=7, [48-108, 83-108] = [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo for y=4, collision at T=6 only.\n\nNow freeway 5 (y=5): same car as y=4? (48,83,left,36), identical, so same as y=4, collision at T=6 only.\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): car (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nRight-moving, so τ=-35, h=-24, span at T: [ -35 +6 δt, -24 +6 δt ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -35 +6 δt, -24 +6 δt ]\n\n-35 +6 δt <=0 <= -24 +6 δt\n\nLeft: -35 +6 δt <=0 => 6 δt <=35 => δt <= 35/6 ≈5.833\n\nRight: 0 <= -24 +6 δt => 6 δt >=24 => δt >=4\n\nSo δt >=4 and δt <=5.833, so δt=4,5\n\nδt=4: T=8, [ -35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], includes 0\n\nδt=5: T=9, [ -35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6], includes 0\n\nδt=3: T=7, [ -35+18, -24+18] = [-17,-6], 0 not in\n\nδt=6: T=10, [ -35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway 7 (y=7): cars (-48,-59,right,4) and (16,5,right,4)\n\nFirst car: right, τ=-59, h=-48, span [ -59 +4 δt, -48 +4 δt ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -59 +4 δt, -48 +4 δt ]\n\n-59 +4 δt <=0 <= -48 +4 δt\n\nLeft: -59 +4 δt <=0 => 4 δt <=59 => δt <=59/4=14.75\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 +4 δt => 4 δt >=48 => δt >=12\n\nSo δt >=12 and δt <=14.75, so δt=12,13,14\n\nAt those, 0 is in span.\n\nBut we may not care if far.\n\nSecond car: (16,5,right,4) τ=5, h=16, span [5+4 δt, 16+4 δt]\n\nAlways positive for δt>=0, min 5>0, so 0 never in. Safe.\n\nSo for y=7, collision at T=16,17,18? But turns might not go that far, and we start from t=4, so T=4+12=16, etc. But we might not be there at those times.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 (y=8): car (-36,-47,right,3)\n\nτ=-47, h=-36, span [ -47 +3 δt, -36 +3 δt ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -47 +3 δt, -36 +3 δt ]\n\n-47 +3 δt <=0 <= -36 +3 δt\n\nLeft: -47 +3 δt <=0 => 3 δt <=47 => δt <=47/3≈15.666\n\nRight: 0 <= -36 +3 δt => 3 δt >=36 => δt >=12\n\nSo δt >=12 and δt <=15.666, so δt=12,13,14,15\n\nCollision at T=16 to 19.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 at t=4 to y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so no issue.\n\ny=0 also no cars, but I start from y=3.\n\nNow, the minimum steps: from y=3 to y=9, I need to increase by 6, so if I go up every turn, it takes 6 moves: U,U,U,U,U,U.\n\nBut I need to avoid collisions on the way.\n\nAt each turn, I must be on a safe freeway.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe times for each freeway.\n\nFrom above:\n\ny=1: unsafe only at T=5 (δt=1)\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=6 (δt=2)\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=6 (δt=2)\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=6 (δt=2)\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=6 (δt=2)\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=8 and T=9 (δt=4,5)\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=16,17,18 (δt=12,13,14) — far, probably not relevant\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=16,17,18,19 (δt=12,13,14,15) — also far\n\nAt turn T, the freeway is unsafe if any car on that row has 0 in span at T.\n\nFor y=1, only T=5 unsafe\n\ny=2, only T=6 unsafe\n\ny=3, only T=6 unsafe\n\ny=4, only T=6 unsafe\n\ny=5, only T=6 unsafe\n\ny=6, T=8 and T=9 unsafe\n\ny=7, unsafe at T=16,17,18 but since we go to y=9 quickly, not an issue.\n\nSimilarly y=8.\n\nI start at t=4, y=3.\n\nAt t=4, y=3 is safe, as we saw.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nIf I go directly up.\n\nOption 1: always up.\n\nActions: U,U,U,U,U,U\n\nThen positions:\n\nTurn t=4: y=3 (start)\n\nAfter a_4=U, y_5 = 3+1=4\n\nAt turn t=5, I am on y=4? Let's see:\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nAfter choosing a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nSo at turn t=4: I am at y_4=3, choose a_4, then y_5 = y_4 + Δy\n\nThen at turn t=5, I am at y_5, and so on.\n\nSo for collision at turn t, I need y_t to be safe.\n\nIn this case, t=4: y=3, safe as per above.\n\nt=5: I am on y_5\n\nIf I go up at t=4, a_4=U, y_5=4\n\nThen at t=5, I am on y=4? y_t at turn t.\n\nAt turn t=5, position is y_5.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t, position y_t.\n\nNow, if I always go up from t=4 to t=9? Let's list turns.\n\nStart: t=4, y=3\n\nChoose a_4=U, then y_5=4\n\nAt turn t=5, I am on y_5=4\n\nNow, is y=4 safe at t=5?\n\nFrom above, y=4 has car, unsafe only at T=6, not at T=5.\n\nAt t=5, δt = t-4 =1, for y=4, at δt=1, we had [12,47], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at t=5, I choose a_5=U, then y_6=5\n\nAt turn t=6, I am on y=5\n\ny=5 at t=6: t=6, δt=2, for y=5, which is same as y=4, collision at T=6, so unsafe.\n\nAt t=6, y=5 is unsafe.\n\nBut in the sequence, if I go up, at t=6 I am on y=5, which is unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=5 at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up again, at t=6, y_6=5, unsafe.\n\nNow, what about other y's at t=6.\n\nt=6, δt=2.\n\ny=1: at δt=1 unsafe, but δt=2 safe.\n\ny=2: unsafe at δt=2, T=6\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=6: at δt=2, T=6, δt=2, for y=6, car at [ -35 +6*2, -24 +6*2] = [ -35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12]? Earlier for y=6, collision only at δt=4,5, so at δt=2, T=6, span [ -35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=7: safe, etc.\n\nSo at t=6, freeways y=1, y=6,7,8 are safe, but y=2,3,4,5 are unsafe.\n\nSpecifically, y=1 safe, y=2 unsafe, y=3 unsafe, y=4 unsafe, y=5 unsafe, y=6 safe, y=7 safe, y=8 safe.\n\nIn the direct up path, at t=6 I would be on y=5 if I went up twice, but it's unsafe.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=2,3,4,5 at t=6.\n\nSince I start at y=3 at t=4, and t=6 is soon.\n\nI could delay or move differently.\n\nSince y=6 is safe at t=6, I could be there.\n\nBut I need to get to y=9.\n\nMinimum steps: I can go up, but not at certain times.\n\nAnother idea: I can stay or go down to avoid.\n\nBut y=0 is safe.\n\nNow, let's list possible paths.\n\nI need to reach y=9 in min H.\n\nSince the unsafe zone is at t=6 for y=2-5, I should not be on those rows at t=6.\n\nt=6 is turn 6.\n\nNow, at t=4, I am at y=3.\n\nI can choose action at t=4.\n\nOptions: U, D, or S.\n\nIf S, stay, y_5=3\n\nThen at t=5, on y=3.\n\ny=3 at t=5: δt=1, for y=3, car at [ -35+12*1, -24+12*1] = [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe. And second car [37+12,48+12]=[49,60], safe. So y=3 safe at t=5.\n\nThen at t=5, I choose action.\n\nIf I go U at t=4, y_5=4.\n\ny=4 at t=5: δt=1, [48-36,83-36]=[12,47], safe.\n\nBut then at t=5, if I go U, y_6=5, then at t=6 on y=5, unsafe.\n\nIf at t=5 I go S, y_6=4, then at t=6 on y=4, which is unsafe at t=6.\n\nIf at t=5 I go D, y_6=3, then at t=6 on y=3, unsafe.\n\nSo if I am at y=4 or y=5 at t=5, and I go U or S, I end up on y=5 or y=4 at t=6, unsafe, or if D to y=3, unsafe.\n\ny=3 at t=6 unsafe.\n\nSo the only way to be safe at t=6 is to be on y=1, or y=6,7,8.\n\nBut y=1 at t=6 is safe, as we saw.\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8 safe.\n\nNow, from t=4, I can go down to y=2 or y=1, or up to y=4, but then need to handle t=5 and t=6.\n\nLet's plan from start.\n\nAt t=4, y=3.\n\nOption: go down to y=2.\n\na_4=D, then y_5=3-1=2\n\nThen at t=5, on y=2.\n\ny=2 at t=5: δt=1, for y=2, cars: first car [ -35+12*1, -24+12*1] = [-23,-12], 0 not in; second car [37+12,48+12]=[49,60], safe. So y=2 safe at t=5.\n\nThen at t=5, I need to choose action to avoid t=6.\n\nAt t=5, on y=2.\n\nIf I go U, y_6=3, but y=3 unsafe at t=6.\n\nIf S, y_6=2, y=2 unsafe at t=6.\n\nIf D, y_6=1, then at t=6 on y=1.\n\ny=1 at t=6: δt=2, for y=1, span [ -95+48*2, -48+48*2] = [ -95+96, -48+96] = [1,48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo if at t=5 I go D to y=1, then at t=6 on y=1, safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go up to y=9.\n\nBut let's see the turns.\n\nStart: t=4, y=3\n\na_4=D → y_5=2\n\nt=5: on y=2, choose a_5=D → y_6=1\n\nt=6: on y=1, choose a_6=U → y_7=2\n\nt=7: on y=2, now y=2 at t=7: δt=3, for y=2, first car [ -35+12*3, -24+12*3] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in; second car [37+36,48+36]=[73,84], safe. So safe.\n\nI can go U: a_6=U? At t=6, on y=1, a_6=U → y_7=2\n\nThen t=7 on y=2, a_7=U → y_8=3\n\nt=8 on y=3\n\ny=3 at t=8: δt=4, for y=3, first car [ -35+12*4, -24+12*4] = [-35+48, -24+48] = [13,24], safe; second car [37+48,48+48]=[85,96], safe. So safe.\n\na_7=U → y_8=3\n\nThen a_8=U → y_9=4\n\nt=9 on y=4\n\ny=4 at t=9: δt=5, for y=4, car [48-36*5, 83-36*5] = [48-180,83-180]=[-132,-97], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen a_9=U → y_10=5\n\nt=10 on y=5, similarly, y=5 same as y=4, safe at t=10.\n\na_10=U → y_11=6\n\nt=11 on y=6\n\ny=6 at t=11: δt=7, for y=6, car [ -35 +6*7, -24 +6*7] = [-35+42, -24+42]=[7,18], safe, since collision only at δt=4,5.\n\nThen a_11=U → y_12=7\n\nt=12 on y=7\n\ny=7 at t=12: δt=8, for y=7, first car [ -59 +4*8, -48+4*8] = [-59+32, -48+32]=[-27,-16], 0 not in; second car [5+32,16+32]=[37,48], safe. Collision only at higher δt.\n\nSimilarly a_12=U → y_13=8\n\nt=13 on y=8\n\ny=8 at t=13: δt=9, [ -47 +3*9, -36+3*9] = [-47+27, -36+27]=[-20,-9], safe.\n\na_13=U → y_14=9\n\nt=14 on y=9, reached.\n\nBut this took many turns: from t=4 to t=14, 10 turns? Let's count the actions.\n\nActions from t=4 to t=13 inclusive? Positions:\n\nAfter H actions, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nt_1=4.\n\nStart: at t=4, before action, y=3.\n\nAfter a_4, y_5\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t_1 + H -1}, y_{t_1 + H} =9\n\nSo number of actions H, to reach at time t_1 + H.\n\nIn this path:\n\na_4: D → y_5=2\n\na_5: D → y_6=1\n\na_6: U → y_7=2\n\na_7: U → y_8=3\n\na_8: U → y_9=4\n\na_9: U → y_10=5\n\na_10: U → y_11=6\n\na_11: U → y_12=7\n\na_12: U → y_13=8\n\na_13: U → y_14=9\n\nSo I reached y_14=9, with actions from t=4 to t=13, H=10 actions.\n\nBut this is inefficient, I went down to y=1 and then up slowly.\n\nI could stay at y=3 or go up earlier but avoid t=6.\n\nAt t=4, y=3, I could go S (stay), then y_5=3\n\nAt t=5, on y=3, which is safe as δt=1.\n\nThen at t=5, I need to choose action.\n\nIf I go U at t=5, y_6=4, but at t=6, y=4 unsafe.\n\nIf I go S, y_6=3, unsafe at t=6.\n\nIf I go D, y_6=2, unsafe at t=6.\n\nSo all lead to unsafe at t=6.\n\nUnless I go to a safe row at t=6.\n\nAt t=5, I am on y=3.\n\nFrom y=3, I can only go to y=2,3,4 with actions D,S,U.\n\nBut all of y=2,3,4 are unsafe at t=6.\n\ny=1 is safe, but I can't reach y=1 from y=3 at t=5 with one action; I can only go to y=2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly, I can't reach y=5 or above in one step.\n\nSo from y=3 at t=5, no matter what I do, at t=6 I will be on y=2,3, or4, all unsafe.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be at y=3 at t=5 if I want to avoid t=6 on those rows.\n\nIf I go up at t=4 to y=4, then at t=5 on y=4, safe, but then at t=5, if I go U, to y=5 at t=6 unsafe; if S to y=4 unsafe; if D to y=3 unsafe. Same problem.\n\nSo the only way is to not be on rows 2-5 at t=6.\n\nI need to be on y=1 or y=6 or above at t=6.\n\ny=6 is row 6.\n\nNow, from start t=4, y=3.\n\nTo be on y=6 at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, position y_6.\n\nFrom t=4 to t=6, two actions: a_4 and a_5, to go from y=3 to y_6.\n\ny_6 = y_4 + Δy_4 + Δy_5\n\nSince y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\ny_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\ny_6 = y_5 + Δy_5 = y_4 + Δy_4 + Δy_5\n\ny_4=3, so y_6 = 3 + Δy_4 + Δy_5\n\nΔy is +1, -1, or 0.\n\nSo y_6 can be from 3-1-1=1 to 3+1+1=5, so y_6 between 1 and 5.\n\nCannot reach y=6 in two steps from y=3.\n\nMax y_6=5 if U,U.\n\nMin y_6=1 if D,D.\n\nBut y=6 not reachable at t=6 from t=4.\n\nSimilarly, y=7,8,9 even farther.\n\nTo be on y=1 at t=6: possible with D,D: a_4=D, a_5=D, y_6=1.\n\nThen as before.\n\nBut y=1 at t=6 is safe.\n\nThen I can go up.\n\nBut to reach y=9, it takes time.\n\nI could go down to y=0 or something.\n\ny=0 is safe, no cars.\n\nBut similar.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=6, y=6 is safe, but I can't be there at t=6 from t=4.\n\nBut I can be there later.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at y=3 until after t=6.\n\nFor example, at t=4, go S or D, but let's see.\n\nAt t=4, if I go S, y_5=3\n\nThen at t=5, on y=3.\n\nAs before, at t=5, if I go S, y_6=3, unsafe; U to y=4 unsafe; D to y=2 unsafe.\n\nAll unsafe at t=6.\n\nUnless I can go to y=1 at t=6, but from y=3 at t=5, I can go D to y=2 at t=6, which is unsafe, or to y=3 or4, all unsafe. Can't go to y=1 directly.\n\nFrom y=3, action D goes to y=2, not to y=1 directly.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=1 at t=6 if at t=5 I am on y=3.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=4 I go U to y=4 at t=5, same thing.\n\nSo the only way to be safe at t=6 is to be on y=1 at t=6, which requires going down twice from t=4.\n\na_4=D, a_5=D, to y_6=1.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nBut to minimize H, I can go up faster after t=6.\n\nAfter t=6, the only unsafe times are for y=6 at t=8 and t=9, and others later not relevant.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nt=8 and t=9.\n\nNow, if I am on y=1 at t=6, I can go up.\n\na_6=U → y_7=2\n\nt=7 on y=2, safe as δt=3, [1,12] etc.\n\na_7=U → y_8=3\n\nt=8 on y=3.\n\ny=3 at t=8: δt=4, as before [13,24] safe.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9.\n\nAt t=8 on y=3.\n\nIf I go U, y_9=4\n\nt=9 on y=4.\n\ny=4 at t=9: δt=5, [48-180,83-180]=[-132,-97]? δt=5, T=9, t_1=4, δt=5.\n\ny=4 car: [48 -36*5, 83-36*5] = [48-180,83-180]=[-132,-97], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen a_9=U → y_10=5\n\nSimilarly safe.\n\nBut at t=9, I am on y=4, but y=6 is unsafe at t=9, but I am not on y=6.\n\nNow, to reach y=9.\n\nFrom t=8 y=3, a_8=U → y_9=4\n\na_9=U → y_10=5\n\na_10=U → y_11=6\n\nt=11 on y=6.\n\nBut y=6 is unsafe at t=8 and t=9, but t=11 is later, safe.\n\nδt=7, [7,18] safe.\n\nThen a_11=U → y_12=7\n\na_12=U → y_13=8\n\na_13=U → y_14=9\n\nStill 10 actions.\n\nBut I can go faster after t=6.\n\nFrom t=6 on y=1.\n\na_6=U → y_7=2\n\na_7=U → y_8=3\n\nAt t=8 on y=3, safe.\n\nBut at t=8, y=6 is unsafe, but I am on y=3.\n\nNow, I can go directly to y=6 or something, but with actions.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=8, I need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimum 6 steps: U,U,U,U,U,U to y=9 at t=14?

List:\n\nt=6: on y=1, a_6=U → y_7=2\n\nt=7: on y=2, a_7=U → y_8=3\n\nt=8: on y=3, a_8=U → y_9=4\n\nt=9: on y=4, a_9=U → y_10=5\n\nt=10: on y=5, a_10=U → y_11=6\n\nt=11: on y=6, a_11=U → y_12=7\n\nt=12: on y=7, a_12=U → y_13=8\n\nt=13: on y=8, a_13=U → y_14=9\n\nSo from a_6 to a_13, 8 actions, but a_6 is at t=6, and we have a_4 and a_5 before.\n\nFrom start: a_4=D, a_5=D, a_6=U, ..., a_13=U, so actions from t=4 to t=13, 10 actions, same as before.\n\nBut I can save time by going to higher rows faster.\n\nSince after t=6, most rows are safe except y=6 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nBut I can avoid being on y=6 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nFor example, from t=6 on y=1, I can go up faster, but I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=0 at some point, but y=0 is safe, but it might not help.\n\nPerhaps at t=4, I go up to y=4, but then at t=5, instead of going to y=5, I go down or something.\n\nAt t=4, a_4=U → y_5=4\n\nAt t=5, on y=4, safe.\n\nNow at t=5, if I go D, a_5=D → y_6=3\n\nBut at t=6, y=3 unsafe.\n\nIf I go S, y_6=4, unsafe.\n\nIf I go U, y_6=5, unsafe.\n\nAll unsafe.\n\nSo no.\n\nThe only safe way at t=6 is to be on y=1 or y=6+, but y=6+ not reachable, so only y=1.\n\nThus, I must be on y=1 at t=6 to avoid collision.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, I need to minimize the time after t=6.\n\nNow, from y=1 at t=6, I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe direct path: U to y=2 at t=7, U to y=3 at t=8, U to y=4 at t=9, and so on, to y=9 at t=14.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, y=6 is unsafe, but I am not on it, so ok.\n\nBut I am on y=3 at t=8, y=4 at t=9, etc., all safe.\n\nBut I can go faster? No, because I can only increase y by 1 per turn.\n\nUnless I can skip some rows, but no, each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo minimum 8 steps from y=1 to y=9: from y=1 to y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, 8 steps, so at turn t=6+H, y=9, with H=8, so t=14.\n\nWith the two down actions at beginning, total from t=4 to t=14, 10 turns.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach y=9 earlier if I start from higher.\n\nAnother thought: maybe I can go up to y=6 before t=6 or after, but before not possible.\n\nOr after, but with the constraint of y=6 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=6 before t=8 or after t=9.\n\nBut from y=1 at t=6, to y=6, I need 5 steps: U,U,U,U,U to y=6 at t=11.\n\nt=6 y=1, a_6=U y_7=2, a_7=U y_8=3, a_8=U y_9=4, a_9=U y_10=5, a_10=U y_11=6.\n\nSo at t=11 on y=6, which is safe since δt=7>5.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=14.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf I go faster to y=6, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps I don't need to go all the way down to y=1.\n\nFor example, at t=6, y=7 is safe, but I can't reach it from t=4.\n\ny=7 at t=6: to be on y=7 at t=6, from y=3 at t=4, y_6 = 3 + Δy4 + Δy5, max 5, min 1, so y=7 impossible.\n\nSimilarly, only possible y at t=6 are 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nAnd among these, only y=1 is safe at t=6.\n\ny=2,3,4,5 all unsafe.\n\nSo indeed, only choice is to be on y=1 at t=6.\n\nThus, I must go down twice at the beginning.\n\nThen the minimal H is 10, with the sequence as above.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a shorter way.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=0.\n\ny=0 has no cars, always safe.\n\nAt t=4, if I go D, y_5=2\n\nThen at t=5, go D, y_6=1, same as before.\n\nOr at t=5, from y=2, go D to y_6=1, same.\n\nIf at t=4 I go D to y_5=2, then at t=5 go D to y_6=1, as before.\n\nIf at t=4 I go S to y_5=3, then at t=5 go D to y_6=2, but y=2 unsafe at t=6.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo no.\n\nAfter being on y=1 at t=6, I can go up, but perhaps I can reach y=9 faster by going through rows that are safe.\n\nBut the path is fixed, I have to go through each y.\n\nUnless I can stay or something, but that would take more time.\n\nFor example, if I stay at some point, it takes extra turns.\n\nSo to minimize H, I should never stay or go down except necessary.\n\nIn this case, the necessary down is at the beginning.\n\nThen up as fast as possible.\n\nBut in the up path, from y=1 to y=9, 8 up actions, no choice.\n\nBut let's see the time for y=6.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nIn the path, when I am on y=6, it should not be at t=8 or t=9.\n\nIn the standard path, I am on y=6 at t=11, which is fine.\n\nIf I could be on y=6 earlier, but from y=1 at t=6, earliest t=11 to y=6.\n\ny=1 at t=6, y_6=1\n\na_6=U y_7=2\n\na_7=U y_8=3\n\na_8=U y_9=4\n\na_9=U y_10=5\n\na_10=U y_11=6\n\nYes, t=11.\n\nIf I go faster, I can't.\n\nPerhaps from y=1, I go up multiple times, but no.\n\nAnother idea: after t=6, since y=6 is unsafe at t=8 and t=9, I can be on other rows.\n\nBut in the path, I am not on y=6 at t=8 or t=9, I am on y=3 and y=4 at those times, which are safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, minimal H is 10.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose at t=4, I go U to y=4 at t=5.\n\nThen at t=5, I cannot go to y=5, but I have to do something.\n\nIf I go D to y=3 at t=6, but unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I go to y=5 at t=5, but then at t=5 on y=5, is it safe?\n\nt=5, δt=1, for y=5, car [48-36,83-36]=[12,47], safe.\n\nThen at t=5 on y=5, safe.\n\nBut then at t=5, if I go U to y_6=6, then at t=6 on y=6.\n\ny=6 at t=6: δt=2, for y=6, car [ -35 +6*2, -24+12] = [-35+12, -24+12]=[-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nOh! y=6 at t=6 is safe.\n\nI forgot that.\n\nIn this case, from t=4, a_4=U → y_5=4\n\nAt t=5, on y=4, safe.\n\nThen a_5=U → y_6=5? a_5=U, y_6 = y_5 +1 =4+1=5\n\nThen at t=6 on y=5, which is unsafe, as we have.\n\nBut if at t=5, I go U, y_6=5 for y=5, unsafe.\n\nBut to go to y=6, from y=4 at t=5, I need to go U, which goes to y=5 at t=6, not directly to y=6.\n\ny_6 = y_5 + Δy_5\n\ny_5=4, if a_5=U, y_6=5\n\nThen at t=6 on y=5.\n\nIf I want to be on y=6 at t=6, I need y_6=6, so from y_5, I need y_5 + Δy_5 =6, so if y_5=5, Δy_5=1, or y_5=6, Δy_5=0, but at t=5, y_5=4, so I can only go to y=5 max at t=6.\n\nCannot be on y=6 at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, min y=3 at t=6.\n\nSo only y=1 to 5 possible at t=6, and only y=1 safe.\n\nThus, no other choice.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10, with the sequence: D, D, then U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U.\n\nIn terms of actions.\n\nStart t=4, y=3\n\na_4 = D → y_5=2\n\na_5 = D → y_6=1\n\na_6 = U → y_7=2\n\na_7 = U → y_8=3\n\na_8 = U → y_9=4\n\na_9 = U → y_10=5\n\na_10 = U → y_11=6\n\na_11 = U → y_12=7\n\na_12 = U → y_13=8\n\na_13 = U → y_14=9\n\nSo actions: a_4=D, a_5=D, a_6=U, a_7=U, a_8=U, a_9=U, a_10=U, a_11=U, a_12=U, a_13=U\n\nH=10 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so t=4 to t=13.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut let's confirm if all positions are safe.\n\nt=4: y=3, safe as δt=0\n\nt=5: y=2 (after a_4=D, at t=5 y=2), δt=1, y=2 cars: [-23,-12] and [49,60], 0 not in, safe\n\nt=6: y=1, δt=2, [1,48], 0 not in, safe\n\nt=7: y=2, δt=3, [1,12] and [73,84], safe?

But at t=6, if I stay, y=4 unsafe.\n\nIf at t=5, I go D to y=3, then at t=6 y=3 unsafe.\n\nIf I go U to y=5 at t=6, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nAt t=4, go U to y=4 at t=5.\n\nThen at t=5, I have to choose, but all lead to unsafe at t=6 except if I could go to y=1, but can't.\n\nSo impossible to avoid without going down.\n\nThus, the sequence must include two downs at the beginning.\n\nThen the minimal H is 10.\n\nSo for the answer.\n\nThe actions are for turns starting from t_1=4.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nIn the sequence, after a_13=U, y_14=9, so last action at turn 13.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut let's make sure about the car on y=6 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nIn this path, at t=8, I am on y=3, not y=6; t=9 on y=4, not y=6, so no issue.\n\nAnd all other times safe as checked.\n\nPerhaps I can go up faster after t=6.\n\nFor example, from t=6 on y=1, a_6=U to y_7=2\n\na_7=U to y_8=3\n\nBut at t=8, if I go directly, but I need to go to y=9.\n\nSuppose I want to reach earlier.\n\nBut from y=1 to y=9, min 8 steps, so cannot before t=14.\n\nt=6 y=1, after 8 actions, y_{14}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I start from higher, but I had to go down.\n\nSo I think 10 is minimal.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 3, there are two cars, but I think I handled.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo the sequence should be as above.\n\nNow for the answer format.\n\nIt should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} which is turn 4: D\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1} turn 5: D\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + 9: a_{t_1 +9} turn 13: U\n\nSince H=10, actions from t=0 to H-1 relative, but in absolute, from t=4 to t=13.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo t from 0 to 9, but t is index.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be listed as turns.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: D\nTurn 5: D\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n}\n\nBut let's write the turn numbers.\n\nt_1=4.\n\nSo Turn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nAnd that should be it.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have 10 actions, but from turn 4 to 13 inclusive, that's 10 turns.\n\nYes.\n\nTo confirm, position at turn 13: after a_13=U, y_14=9, but at turn 13, I am at y_13=8, and I choose U, so at turn 13 I am on y=8, which is safe, and after action, to y=9 at turn 14.\n\nBut the collision is only when I am on the freeway at that turn, so at turn 13, I am on y=8, safe, and I reach y=9 at turn 14.\n\nIn the task, it says \"reach (0,9)\", so when y_{t_1 + H} =9, at turn t_1 + H.\n\nHere t_1 + H =14.\n\nAnd H=10.\n\nThe sequence ends with action at turn 13.\n\nI think correct.\n\nSo minimal H is 10.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the player must navigate around the unsafe conditions at specific turns. The analysis of car movements shows that:\n\n- Freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\) are unsafe at turn \\(T = 6\\) (relative to \\(t_1 = 4\\), meaning the player cannot be on these rows at turn 6.\n- The only safe row at turn 6 is \\(y = 1\\), as other rows (\\(y = 6, 7, 8\\)) are unreachable from \\(y = 3\\) in two turns.\n- To be on \\(y = 1\\) at turn 6, the player must move down twice from turn 4 to turn 5.\n- After turn 6, the player can move up directly to \\(y = 9\\) without encountering other unsafe conditions, as \\(y = 6\\) is unsafe only at turns 8 and 9, but the player is not on \\(y = 6\\) at those times in this path.\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\(y = 9\\) is 10, with the sequence of actions starting from turn 4:\n\n- At turn 4, move down (D) to reach \\(y = 2\\) at turn 5.\n- At turn 5, move down (D) to reach \\(y = 1\\) at turn 6 (safe at turn 6).\n- From turn 6 to turn 13, move up (U) each turn to increment \\(y\\) by 1 per turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14.\n\nAll positions during the sequence are safe:\n- Turn 4 (\\(y = 3\\)): Safe, as no car on \\(y = 3\\) covers position 0 at \\(\\delta t = 0\\).\n- Turn 5 (\\(y = 2\\)): Safe, with car spans \\([-23, -12]\\) and \\([49, 60]\\), 0 not covered.\n- Turn 6 (\\(y = 1\\)): Safe, with car span \\([1, 48]\\), 0 not covered.\n- Turn 7 (\\(y = 2\\)): Safe, with car spans \\([1, 12]\\) and \\([73, 84]\\), 0 not covered.\n- Turn 8 (\\(y = 3\\)): Safe, with car spans \\([13, 24]\\) and \\([85, 96]\\), 0 not covered.\n- Turn 9 (\\(y = 4\\)): Safe, with car span \\([-132, -97]\\), 0 not covered.\n- Turn 10 (\\(y = 5\\)): Safe, with car span \\([-168, -133]\\), 0 not covered.\n- Turn 11 (\\(y = 6\\)): Safe, with car span \\([7, 18]\\), 0 not covered.\n- Turn 12 (\\(y = 7\\)): Safe, with car spans \\([-27, -16]\\) and \\([37, 48]\\), 0 not covered.\n- Turn 13 (\\(y = 8\\)): Safe, with car span \\([-20, -9]\\), 0 not covered.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns 4 to 13 achieves \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14 with \\(H = 10\\) turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: D \\\\\nTurn 5: D \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U\n}",

The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\n Important note: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that exact turn.\n\n Also note: When the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at turn T they are still on y_T. So they only check the car on the freeway corresponding to y_T at turn T. They are not on y_{T+1} until the next turn.\n\n We are to compute the minimal H and the sequence of actions (U, D, S) from turn t1 (which is 5) until we reach y=9.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We need to model the car positions at any future turn T (>=5). The cars move with constant speed and direction.\n\n 2. For each freeway k (from 1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, we can compute the span at turn T (relative to turn t0=5) as:\n\n    Let dt = T - 5.\n\n    For a right-moving car (d = 'right'):\n        head = initial_head + s * dt\n        tail = initial_tail + s * dt\n        So the span is [tail, head] (since tail is the leftmost and head the rightmost? But note the initial representation: \n        In the table, for a right-moving car, they give (head, tail) at t1=5? Actually, the table says \"Cars (head, tail, direction, speed)\".\n\n        However, note the update rule for right-moving: \n            Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]   [but wait: in the update rule it says: for right-moving: [tau, h] -> [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]. \n\n        How is the initial state given? The table for freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48). \n        This means at turn t1=5, the head is 0 and the tail is -47? But then the span at t1=5 is [ -47, 0 ]? \n\n        However, the update rule for right-moving says: \n            initial span is [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]\n\n        But the table gives (head, tail) and then the update rule uses [tau, h]? \n\n        Let me reconcile:\n\n        The update rule says: \n          Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n        But the table gives: (head, tail). So which is which?\n\n        Looking at the example for freeway 1: \n          (head=0, tail=-47, right, 48) -> then at t1, the span is [tail, head]? or [head, tail]? \n\n        The update rule for right-moving says: \n          initial: [tau, h] -> so tau is the leftmost (tail) and h is the rightmost (head). \n\n        So the table's (head, tail) corresponds to (h, tau) in the update rule? \n\n        Actually, the table says: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, ...)\" so head = h, tail = tau.\n\n        Therefore, for a right-moving car at t1=5:\n          tau (tail) = -47, h (head) = 0 -> so the span at t1=5 is [tau, h] = [-47, 0].\n\n        Then at turn T, the span becomes: [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt] = [-47 + 48*dt, 0 + 48*dt].\n\n        Similarly, for left-moving: \n          update rule: [h, tau] -> [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]\n          and the table for freeway 4: (head=12, tail=47, left, 36) -> so h=12, tau=47? \n          then the span at t1=5 is [h, tau] = [12,47]? \n          but the update rule says: for left-moving, the initial span is [h, tau] -> then at T: [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt] = [12-36*dt, 47-36*dt].\n\n        However, note that for left-moving, the head is the leftmost? and the tail is the rightmost? \n\n        Actually, the update rule for left-moving: \n          initial: [h, tau] -> so h is the leftmost (head) and tau the rightmost (tail). \n\n        But the table gives: head and tail. So we must assume that the head is the front of the car and tail is the back. \n\n        In the update rule, for left-moving, the head is at the left? \n\n        Let me check the update: \n          Left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt] \n          and if the car is moving left, then the entire car shifts left.\n\n        So for freeway 4: at t1=5: [12,47] -> at T: [12-36*dt, 47-36*dt].\n\n 3. Collision condition: \n        At turn T, if the player is on freeway k (which is y_T) and at that turn T, the freeway k has at least one car whose span includes 0.\n\n        That is, for a car on freeway k at turn T: \n          if the car is right-moving: [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt] contains 0? -> tau + s*dt <= 0 <= h + s*dt.\n          if the car is left-moving: [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt] contains 0? -> h - s*dt <= 0 <= tau - s*dt.\n\n        Note: dt = T - 5.\n\n 4. The player starts at y=2 at turn 5. We can only move U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay: y same). And we must stay within [0,9].\n\n 5. We wish to get to y=9. The minimal number of turns H is the number of actions taken until we first reach y=9.\n\n    Since we start at y=2, the minimal without any obstacles would be 7 moves (only U) to go from 2 to 9 (7 steps). But we have to avoid the freeways at the moment when we are on them and a car is at 0.\n\n 6. We must simulate the path and check for collisions at every turn when the player is on a freeway (y in {1,2,...,8}).\n\n 7. We can try to go as fast as possible (always U) and check if that path is safe. If not, we have to wait (use S) or even go down (D) to avoid a collision, but that would increase H.\n\n 8. However, note that the cars are moving and the spans are shifting. So we can compute the positions of the cars at any future turn.\n\n 9. We'll compute the car spans for each freeway for turns starting from 5 onward.\n\n 10. We are going to do a BFS (or Dijkstra, but since each action cost is 1, BFS by time) over the state (turn, y) to find the minimal time to reach y=9.\n\n     State: (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at t1=5) and y in [0,9].\n\n     We start at (5,2). We wish to reach any state (t,9) and then we stop.\n\n     We can simulate the next state by choosing action in {U, D, S}. Note that if we choose U, then next state is (t+1, y+1) provided y+1<=9; D: (t+1, y-1) provided y-1>=0; S: (t+1, y).\n\n     However, we must check the transition: \n        At the current turn t, the player is at y. Then we choose an action and move to next state (t+1, y').\n\n        But note: during the current turn t, we are at y. So we must check: if y is in [1,8] (i.e., a freeway) then we must ensure that at turn t, no car on freeway y has a span that includes 0.\n\n        How about the next state? At turn t+1, we are at y'. Then we check if y' is in [1,8] at turn t+1? \n\n        So the collision check happens at the state (t, y) when we are at that state? \n\n        Actually, when we are at state (t, y), we are about to choose an action for this turn. But the collision condition says: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (y_T = k) and ... then collision.\n\n        Therefore, when we are at (t, y), we are at turn t and at position y. So we must check if y is between 1 and 8, then we look at the cars on freeway y at turn t (relative to t0=5: dt = t-5) and see if any car's span contains 0.\n\n        If it does, then this state (t,y) is invalid? Actually, we cannot be in a state that causes a collision.\n\n        However, note that we start at (5,2). We must check at turn 5, on freeway 2: are there any cars that have span containing 0?\n\n        So we must check the state at the moment we enter it.\n\n        Therefore, in BFS, when we generate a state (t,y), we must check that if y is in [1,8], then no car on freeway y at turn t has a span that covers 0.\n\n        If it does, then we cannot be in that state.\n\n        But note: we are at (5,2). We must check freeway 2 at turn 5.\n\n 11. For each freeway, we have multiple cars. We must check each car on the freeway corresponding to y.\n\n 12. We'll precompute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each car on that freeway, the intervals of time (if any) when the car's span covers 0? But note that the cars are moving at constant speed and the span is a contiguous interval that shifts linearly. So the condition is a linear inequality.\n\n     Alternatively, we can compute for a given freeway k and a given turn t (dt = t-5) whether 0 is covered by any car on that freeway.\n\n     We'll write a helper function: is_safe(k, t) that returns True if at turn t, freeway k is safe (i.e., no car on k at turn t has span containing 0), else False.\n\n     But note: freeway k might have multiple cars. So we must check each car.\n\n 13. How about the state (t,y) is valid if:\n        - if y==0 or y==9, then no collision (since not a freeway) -> safe.\n        - if y in [1,8], then we require is_safe(y, t) to be True.\n\n 14. We are going to run BFS (by time) starting from (5,2). We mark the state (t,y) and the minimal time to reach it. We wish to find the minimal t such that we have y=9.\n\n     The actions: from (t,y), we can go to (t+1, y') where y' can be y, y+1, y-1 (if within bounds). But we must check that the state (t,y) is safe (if y in [1,8]) and also the next state (t+1,y') must be safe when we get there? \n\n     Actually, we check the state (t,y) when we are at that state. The next state (t+1,y') will be checked when we get there.\n\n     So in the BFS, when we are at state (t,y) (which is safe) and we consider an action that leads to (t+1, y'), then we must check that (t+1, y') is safe (if y' is in [1,8])? \n\n     But note: at the moment we are at (t,y), we choose an action. Then at the next turn, we are at (t+1, y'). So we only check (t,y) at the time we are in it. Then we move to (t+1,y') and check that state at turn t+1.\n\n     Therefore, we do:\n\n        Start with state (5,2). Check: y=2 -> freeway 2. Check freeway 2 at turn 5: is it safe?\n\n        Then from (5,2), we can go to (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) provided the new y is in bounds and then at the next state we check the safety of that state.\n\n     However, note: we are at (5,2) and we are about to take an action. We are safe at (5,2) (we assume we are already there without collision? but we must check). Then we take an action and then at turn 6 we are at (6, y'). Then we check (6,y').\n\n     Therefore, the starting state (5,2) must be safe. Then we generate next states and check the next state when we get there.\n\n 15. Let's check the starting state: (5,2) -> freeway 2 at turn 5.\n\n      Freeway 2 has two cars: \n        car1: (-12, -23, right, 12) -> so at turn 5: \n            right-moving: [tau, h] = [-23, -12]? \n            But wait, the table says: (head, tail) = (-12, -23) -> so head = -12, tail = -23. \n            For a right-moving car, the update rule uses [tau, h] = [tail, head] = [-23, -12]. \n            Then at turn 5 (dt=0): span = [-23, -12]. \n            Does 0 fall in [-23,-12]? No.\n\n        car2: (60, 49, right, 12) -> head=60, tail=49 -> so [tau, h] = [49,60]. \n            At turn5: [49,60]. 0 not in [49,60].\n\n        So freeway 2 at turn5 is safe.\n\n      Therefore, we start.\n\n 16. We'll do BFS:\n\n        Let dist[t][y] = minimal time (number of turns from start? but time is absolute) to reach (t,y). We are interested in the first time we hit y=9.\n\n        We start: (5,2) with dist=0.\n\n        We use a queue: (t, y, path) but we don't want to store the whole path? We can store the parent pointers.\n\n        Alternatively, since we care about the sequence of actions, we can store for each state (t,y) the action that brought us from the parent and the parent state.\n\n        We note that the absolute turn number t can get large? But the minimal H might be around 7 to 10? But if we have to wait, it might be more.\n\n        However, the car patterns are periodic? But the speeds are integers and the cars are long, so the gaps might be large. But we can set a limit, say up to t=100.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Queue: (t, y)\n            Mark visited: (t,y) to avoid revisiting with same or higher time? But we are doing BFS by time (each step increases t by 1) so we will visit each state in increasing t.\n\n            Actually, we can break when we first reach y=9.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n            Let Q be a queue.\n            Let parent[t][y] = (t_prev, y_prev, action) to record the action taken at the previous state to get to (t,y).\n\n            Start: \n                t0 = 5, y0 = 2.\n                Mark visited[5][2] = True.\n                Enqueue (5,2).\n\n            While Q not empty:\n                pop state (t,y)\n\n                if y == 9: \n                    we found a solution. Then we backtrack from (t,y) to (5,2) to get the sequence of actions.\n\n                Otherwise, for each action in [U, D, S]:\n                    Let y_next = y + delta, where:\n                         U: y_next = y+1 (if y<9)\n                         D: y_next = y-1 (if y>0)\n                         S: y_next = y\n\n                    Then next state is (t+1, y_next).\n\n                    Check if y_next is in [1,8]: then we must check that at turn (t+1), freeway y_next is safe.\n\n                    Also, if y_next is 0 or 9, it's safe.\n\n                    And we must not have visited (t+1, y_next) with a path that gets there at the same time? But BFS by time: we only visit each state once per time? \n\n                    Actually, we are doing BFS and we want the minimal time. So the first time we reach a state (t,y) is the minimal time. So we mark visited for (t,y) and then we don't visit it again.\n\n                    So if (t+1, y_next) has not been visited, and it is safe (if applicable), then we enqueue it.\n\n            But note: we are not storing the entire grid for all t? We need to avoid states that we have already visited? However, it is possible to come back to the same y at a later time? But we are looking for minimal time to y=9. So if we have a state (t,y) and we can get to (t',y) with t'<t, then we don't need to consider (t,y) again? But we are doing BFS by time so we visit states in increasing t. Therefore, we will visit (t,y) only once? \n\n            Actually, we are traversing by increasing t. So when we are at time t, we generate t+1. And we mark visited for each (t,y). So we won't visit the same (t,y) twice? \n\n            However, we might have multiple ways to get to the same (t,y) but we only need the first (which is the minimal time). So we mark (t,y) as visited when we first get there.\n\n            But note: we might have a state that we can get to at time t1 and then again at t2>t1, but we don't care because we are doing BFS by time and we break when we first get to y=9.\n\n            However, what if we have to wait? then we might get to the same y at a later time? But we are going to generate that state at time t+1, t+2, etc. and we will avoid revisiting the same (t,y) by the visited set? \n\n            Actually, we don't want to avoid states that occur at a later time if we haven't visited them? But we are doing BFS by time so we are going to visit states in increasing t. So we will visit (t,y) for the first time at the minimal t. Then we mark it visited and skip if we see it again at a higher t? \n\n            But we don't care about non-minimal times? So we can mark (t,y) as visited and then if we see the same (t,y) again we skip. However, note that the same (t,y) will only be generated at the same t? and we are generating from t to t+1. So we don't generate the same state twice at the same t? \n\n            Actually, from one state (t,y) we generate three next states (t+1, y-1), (t+1,y), (t+1,y+1). And if multiple states at time t can lead to the same (t+1,y), then we will try to enqueue it multiple times. So we should check visited for (t+1,y) before enqueuing.\n\n            We'll have a 2D array: visited[t][y] for t from 5 to some max, and y from 0 to 9.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use a dictionary: key = (t,y). \n\n            Steps:\n\n                visited = set()\n                Q = deque([(5,2)])\n                visited.add((5,2))\n\n                while Q:\n                    (t,y) = Q.popleft()\n                    if y==9: \n                        backtrack and output actions.\n\n                    for each action in [U, D, S]:\n                        y_next = ... (if within bounds)\n                        t_next = t+1\n                        if (t_next, y_next) is not in visited:\n                            if y_next in [1,8]:\n                                if freeway y_next is safe at turn t_next: \n                                    then mark visited and enqueue (t_next, y_next)\n                                    and set parent[t_next][y_next] = (t,y, action)\n                            else: # y_next=0 or 9\n                                    mark visited and enqueue (t_next, y_next)\n                                    and set parent\n\n                If we break at y=9, then we backtrack.\n\n            But note: the state (t,y) must be safe at turn t? \n\n            However, we only check the state we are going to (the next state) when we generate it? But what about the starting state? We must check the starting state is safe. We did: (5,2) is safe.\n\n            And we are generating the next state (t_next, y_next) and we check its safety.\n\n 17. Now we need to implement the safety check for a freeway at a given turn.\n\n      We have for each freeway k (1..8) a list of cars. Each car is represented by (head, tail, direction, speed) at turn 5.\n\n      For a car c on freeway k:\n          direction: 'right' or 'left'\n          dt = t - 5   (for the turn t we are checking)\n\n          if direction == 'right':\n              tail0 = car[1]   # because the table: (head, tail, ...) -> so head=car[0], tail=car[1]\n              head0 = car[0]\n              tail_at_t = tail0 + s * dt\n              head_at_t = head0 + s * dt\n              the span is [tail_at_t, head_at_t]   (since right-moving: the car extends from tail_at_t to head_at_t, and tail_at_t <= head_at_t because the car moves right and the head is the right end? Actually, note: at turn5, the car on freeway2: (-12,-23) -> head0=-12, tail0=-23 -> then at t: tail_at_t = -23+12*dt, head_at_t = -12+12*dt -> and note -23+12*dt <= -12+12*dt -> so the interval is [tail_at_t, head_at_t].\n\n          if direction == 'left':\n              head0 = car[0]   # but note: the update rule for left: [h, tau] -> [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt] and the table gives (head, tail) -> so we use:\n              tail0 = car[1]\n              head_at_t = head0 - s * dt\n              tail_at_t = tail0 - s * dt\n              the span is [head_at_t, tail_at_t]? But note: in the update rule, the initial span is [h, tau] and then it shifts. And the condition is that 0 is in [head_at_t, tail_at_t]? But we have head0 and tail0: at turn5, freeway4: (12,47) -> so head0=12, tail0=47. Then at turn t: head_at_t = 12 - 36*dt, tail_at_t = 47-36*dt. And note: 12-36*dt <= 47-36*dt -> so the interval is [head_at_t, tail_at_t].\n\n          Then we check if 0 is in the interval [min(head_at_t, tail_at_t), max(head_at_t, tail_at_t)]? Actually, the update rule gives the entire contiguous segment. But for left-moving, we have [head_at_t, tail_at_t] and for right-moving [tail_at_t, head_at_t]? \n\n          Actually, regardless of the direction, the car occupies the entire interval from the leftmost point to the rightmost point. So:\n\n             For a right-moving car: the leftmost is tail_at_t, the rightmost is head_at_t -> so the interval is [tail_at_t, head_at_t].\n             For a left-moving car: the leftmost is head_at_t (because head0 was the left end at turn5, and as it moves left, the left end becomes head_at_t) and the rightmost is tail_at_t -> so the interval is [head_at_t, tail_at_t]? \n\n          But note: at turn5 for freeway4: [12,47] -> so 12 is the left end? and 47 the right end. Then when it moves left, the entire segment moves left, so the left end becomes 12-36*dt and the right end becomes 47-36*dt. So the interval is [12-36*dt, 47-36*dt]. \n\n          So in both cases, the car occupies the interval [min, max] where min = min(head_at_t, tail_at_t) and max = max(head_at_t, tail_at_t)? \n\n          Actually, no: for a right-moving car, we have tail_at_t <= head_at_t. For left-moving, we have head_at_t <= tail_at_t? \n\n          In the freeway4 example: at turn5: 12<=47 -> so head_at_t=12-36*dt, tail_at_t=47-36*dt -> and 12-36*dt <= 47-36*dt? yes. \n\n          But wait, what about the initial representation for a right-moving car? freeway2 car1: (-12,-23) -> but -23 is less than -12? so tail0=-23, head0=-12 -> then tail_at_t = -23+12*dt, head_at_t=-12+12*dt -> and -23+12*dt <= -12+12*dt. \n\n          So in both cases, we have:\n\n             left_end = min(head0, tail0) + (if right: s*dt, if left: -s*dt) ??? \n\n          Actually, let me write:\n\n             right: \n                 head_at_t = head0 + s*dt\n                 tail_at_t = tail0 + s*dt\n                 and since head0>=tail0? not necessarily: in freeway2 car1: head0=-12, tail0=-23 -> head0>tail0? yes, because -12>-23.\n\n             left:\n                 head_at_t = head0 - s*dt\n                 tail_at_t = tail0 - s*dt\n                 and head0<=tail0? in freeway4: 12<=47 -> yes.\n\n          So the car occupies [min(tail_at_t, head_at_t), max(tail_at_t, head_at_t)]? \n\n          Actually, for right: tail0 is the left end and head0 is the right end -> so at time t: left_end = tail0+s*dt, right_end = head0+s*dt -> so [tail0+s*dt, head0+s*dt].\n\n          For left: head0 is the left end and tail0 is the right end -> so at time t: left_end = head0 - s*dt, right_end = tail0 - s*dt -> so [head0-s*dt, tail0-s*dt].\n\n          Therefore, we can write:\n\n            if direction is 'right':\n                left_end = tail0 + s*dt\n                right_end = head0 + s*dt\n            else: # 'left'\n                left_end = head0 - s*dt\n                right_end = tail0 - s*dt\n\n          Then the car covers [left_end, right_end] (which is contiguous) and we check if 0 is in [left_end, right_end] (inclusive).\n\n      Then for a freeway k at turn t, we check every car on that freeway: if any car has left_end <= 0 <= right_end, then it is unsafe.\n\n 18. Now, we code this helper function:\n\n        def is_freeway_safe(k, t):\n            dt = t - 5   # because the state is at turn t (absolute turn) and the initial state is at turn 5.\n            cars = cars_on_freeway[k]   # list of cars for freeway k\n\n            for car in cars:\n                head0 = car[0]\n                tail0 = car[1]\n                d = car[2]\n                s_val = car[3]\n                if d == 'right':\n                    left_end = tail0 + s_val * dt\n                    right_end = head0 + s_val * dt\n                else: # d == 'left'\n                    left_end = head0 - s_val * dt\n                    right_end = tail0 - s_val * dt\n\n                # Now check if 0 is in [left_end, right_end] (inclusive)\n                if left_end <= 0 <= right_end:\n                    return False   # unsafe: collision\n\n            return True   # safe\n\n 19. We must note: the freeway indices k are from 1 to 8.\n\n 20. Now, we list the cars for each freeway as given:\n\n        freeway1: [(0, -47, 'right', 48)]\n        freeway2: [(-12, -23, 'right', 12), (60, 49, 'right', 12)]   # note: the second car: head0=60, tail0=49 -> so for right: left_end=49+12*dt, right_end=60+12*dt -> but note: 49>60? no, 49<60. So it's [49+12*dt, 60+12*dt]\n        freeway3: same as freeway2: [(-12, -23, 'right', 12), (60, 49, 'right', 12)]\n        freeway4: [(12,47,'left',36)]\n        freeway5: same as freeway4: [(12,47,'left',36)]\n        freeway6: [(-18,-29,'right',6)]   # head0=-18, tail0=-29 -> so for right: left_end = -29+6*dt, right_end=-18+6*dt.\n        freeway7: [(-44,-55,'right',4), (20,9,'right',4)]   # first car: head0=-44? tail0=-55 -> so left_end=-55+4*dt, right_end=-44+4*dt. Second car: head0=20, tail0=9 -> [9+4*dt,20+4*dt]\n        freeway8: [(-33,-44,'right',3)]   # head0=-33, tail0=-44 -> [ -44+3*dt, -33+3*dt ]\n\n 21. Now, we simulate BFS until we get to y=9.\n\n 22. We'll set a limit on t, say up to t=50, to avoid infinite loop (but we expect a solution within 20 moves).\n\n 23.

Then at turn13 we are at (0,9). So we don't need an action at turn13.\n\n        Is there a faster way? \n\n        We saw that going directly at turn6 to y=3 leads to collision. But what if we go up at turn5 to y=3 at turn6? \n            At turn6: freeway3: dt=1 -> car1: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> 0 in the span -> collision. Not allowed.\n\n        What if we go up at turn5 to y=3 at turn6: not safe.\n\n        What if we go down? \n            At turn5: we go down to y=1 at turn6? \n                At turn6: freeway1: dt=1 -> car: (0,-47,right,48) -> left_end = -47+48=1, right_end=0+48=48 -> 0 in [1,48]? no -> safe? \n                But wait: [1,48] does not contain 0 -> safe.\n\n            Then at turn6: we are at y=1. Then we can go up to y=2 at turn7, then to y=3 at turn8? \n                At turn8: freeway3: dt=3 -> car1: [-23+36, -12+36] = [13,24] -> safe.\n                Then we can go up: \n                    freeway4 at turn9: y=4 -> freeway4: dt=4 -> [12-144,47-144] = [-132,-97] -> safe.\n                    freeway5 at turn10: [12-180,47-180] = [-168,-133] -> safe.\n                    freeway6 at turn11: [-29+6*6, -18+6*6] = [-29+36, -18+36] = [7,18] -> safe (0 not in [7,18]).\n                    freeway7 at turn12: \n                         car1: [-55+4*7, -44+4*7] = [-55+28, -44+28] = [-27,-16] -> safe.\n                         car2: [9+28,20+28] = [37,48] -> safe.\n                    freeway8 at turn13: [-44+3*8, -33+3*8] = [-44+24, -33+24] = [-20,-9] -> safe.\n                Then at turn14: we go to y=9.\n\n                Total actions: \n                    turn5: D -> to y=1\n                    turn6: U -> to y=2\n                    turn7: U -> to y=3\n                    ... until turn13: U to y=9? \n                    Actually, from y=1 at turn6 to y=9 at turn14: that's 8 moves? \n                    But we did 8 actions: from turn5 to turn13? and at turn14 we are at y=9.\n\n                That's 9 actions? H=9 -> worse than the 8 we had above.\n\n        So the sequence we found (with one wait) is better.\n\n        But what if we avoid freeway3 by going faster? We cannot because we can only move one step per turn.\n\n        Alternatively, we can try to wait at y=2 for two turns? Then go up at turn7 to y=3 at turn8? \n            Then we get to y=9 at turn14? H=9 -> worse.\n\n        So the minimal H is 8.\n\n        However, we must check if there is a path with H=7? \n\n          We must get to y=9 by turn12 (because 5+7-1=11? wait: we take 7 actions from turn5 to turn11, then at turn12 we are at y=9?).\n\n          How? \n            turn5: y=2 -> then we do 7 U's: \n                turn5: U -> y=3 at turn6 -> but at turn6: freeway3: collision? as above -> not safe.\n\n          So H=7 is not possible.\n\n        Therefore, our sequence with H=8 is minimal.\n\n 26. But let's verify the entire sequence with the BFS we described? \n\n      We'll simulate:\n\n        turn5: at (5,2) -> safe (as we know)\n        action: S -> so at turn6: (6,2)\n\n        turn6: at (6,2) -> freeway2? check: dt=1\n            freeway2: \n                car1: (-12,-23,right,12): [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> 0 in [-11,0] -> collision? \n                    But wait: at turn6, we are at y=2 -> freeway2? yes. \n                    So we must check freeway2 at turn6: \n                         car1: [ -23+12*1, -12+12*1 ] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> unsafe.\n\n        So we cannot stay at y=2 at turn6? \n\n        This is a problem: we planned to stay at turn5 and then at turn6 we are at y=2 -> freeway2 -> and at turn6, freeway2 is unsafe.\n\n        Therefore, we must avoid being at freeway2 at turn6.\n\n        How? \n\n          At turn5, we are at y=2. We have three options:\n\n            Option1: U -> to y=3 at turn6 -> unsafe (freeway3 at turn6: collision)\n            Option2: D -> to y=1 at turn6 -> freeway1 at turn6: \n                    freeway1: car: (0,-47,right,48) -> at dt=1: [ -47+48, 0+48 ] = [1,48] -> 0 not in [1,48] -> safe.\n            Option3: S -> to y=2 at turn6 -> unsafe (as above).\n\n          So the only safe move at turn5 is D to y=1.\n\n        Then we must do:\n\n            turn5: D -> y=1 at turn6.\n\n        Now at turn6: y=1 -> freeway1: safe.\n\n        Then at turn6: we can choose:\n\n            U: to y=2 at turn7 -> freeway2 at turn7: dt=2\n                freeway2: \n                    car1: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> safe (0 not in [1,12])\n                    car2: [49+24, 60+24] = [73,84] -> safe.\n                so safe.\n\n            D: to y=0 at turn7 -> safe (not a freeway) -> but then we are at the bottom, and we have to go up again -> probably not minimal.\n            S: to y=1 at turn7 -> freeway1 at turn7: dt=2 -> [ -47+96, 0+96 ] = [49,96] -> safe.\n\n        We want to go up, so we do U.\n\n        Then at turn7: we are at y=2.\n\n        Then at turn7: we can choose:\n\n            U: to y=3 at turn8 -> freeway3 at turn8: dt=3\n                freeway3: \n                    car1: [-23+36, -12+36] = [13,24] -> safe.\n                    car2: [49+36,60+36] = [85,96] -> safe.\n                safe.\n\n            So we do U.\n\n        Then at turn8: y=3 -> then we go U to y=4 at turn9 -> freeway4 at turn9: dt=4 -> [12-144,47-144]=[-132,-97] -> safe.\n        turn9: U to y=5 at turn10 -> freeway5: [12-180,47-180]=[-168,-133] -> safe.\n        turn10: U to y=6 at turn11 -> freeway6: [-29+6*6, -18+6*6] = [-29+36, -18+36] = [7,18] -> safe.\n        turn11: U to y=7 at turn12 -> freeway7: \n                car1: [-55+4*7, -44+4*7] = [-55+28, -44+28] = [-27,-16] -> safe.\n                car2: [9+28,20+28] = [37,48] -> safe.\n        turn12: U to y=8 at turn13 -> freeway8: [-44+3*8, -33+3*8] = [-44+24, -33+24] = [-20,-9] -> safe.\n        turn13: U to y=9 at turn14.\n\n        So total actions: \n            turn5: D\n            turn6: U\n            turn7: U\n            turn8: U\n            turn9: U\n            turn10: U\n            turn11: U\n            turn12: U\n            turn13: U   -> 9 actions? \n\n        Then at turn14 we are at y=9.\n\n        But wait, we started at turn5 (y=2) and then did 9 actions: from turn5 to turn13 -> then at turn14 we are at y=9.\n\n        So H=9.\n\n        However, we did 9 actions? The problem: the sequence of actions is from turn5 to turn5+H-1. So H=9.\n\n        But is there a better way?\n\n        After going down to y=1 at turn6, at turn6 we are at y=1. Instead of going up to y=2 at turn7, we can go up twice? \n\n            At turn6: we are at y=1 -> we can do U to y=2 at turn7 (safe) and then at turn7 we do U to y=3 at turn8? \n\n            We did: \n                turn6: U -> y=2 at turn7 (safe as above)\n                turn7: U -> y=3 at turn8 (safe as above) -> then we are at the same as before.\n\n        Alternatively, at turn7 we are at y=2 -> can we do U twice? \n\n            turn7: U -> y=3 at turn8 -> safe.\n            turn8: U -> y=4 at turn9 -> safe.\n\n        So we cannot skip.\n\n        How about at turn5: we do D to y=1 at turn6 (safe). Then at turn6: we do U to y=2 at turn7 (safe). Then at turn7: we do U to y=3 at turn8 (safe). Then we continue as before.\n\n        Total 9 actions.\n\n        But earlier we thought of waiting at y=2 for one turn? but then we found that at turn6, y=2 is unsafe.\n\n        How about at turn5: we do nothing (S) -> then at turn6: y=2 -> unsafe -> not allowed.\n\n        How about at turn5: we do U -> unsafe.\n\n        So the only safe move at turn5 is D.\n\n        Then we have to do 9 actions.\n\n        But wait: what if at turn6 we are at y=1 and then we do not U but S? \n            Then at turn7: we are at y=1 -> freeway1: dt=2 -> [ -47+96, 0+96] = [49,96] -> safe.\n            Then at turn7: we do U to y=2 at turn8 -> freeway2 at turn8: dt=3 -> \n                car1: [-23+36, -12+36] = [13,24] -> safe.\n                car2: [49+36,60+36]=[85,96] -> safe.\n            Then at turn8: we do U to y=3 at turn9 -> freeway3 at turn9: dt=4 -> \n                car1: [-23+48, -12+48]=[25,36] -> safe.\n                car2: [49+48,60+48]=[97,108] -> safe.\n            Then we continue: \n                turn9: U to y=4 at turn10 -> freeway4: [12-36*5, 47-36*5] = [12-180,47-180]=[-168,-133] -> safe.\n                turn10: U to y=5 -> freeway5: same as freeway4 at turn10: [12-36*5,47-36*5]? wait no: at turn10: dt=5 -> [12-180,47-180] -> same? \n                    Actually, freeway5: same car as freeway4? -> [12-180,47-180] -> safe.\n                turn11: U to y=6 -> freeway6: [-29+6*6, -18+6*6] = [7,18] -> safe.\n                turn12: U to y=7 -> freeway7: [-55+4*7, -44+4*7] = [-27,-16] and [9+28,20+28]=[37,48] -> safe.\n                turn13: U to y=8 -> freeway8: [-44+3*8, -33+3*8]=[-20,-9] -> safe.\n                turn14: U to y=9.\n\n            This is 10 actions? \n\n        So the first alternative (going up at turn6) is better.\n\n        Therefore, minimal H is 9.\n\n        But let me double-check the freeway2 at turn7 (if we go from y=1 at turn6 to y=2 at turn7): \n            freeway2 at turn7: dt = 7-5=2\n            car1: [-23+12*2, -12+12*2] = [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> safe.\n            car2: [49+24,60+24]=[73,84] -> safe.\n\n        So it is safe.\n\n        Therefore, the sequence is:\n\n            Turn 5: D\n            Turn 6: U\n            Turn 7: U\n            Turn 8: U   # to y=3 at turn8 -> freeway3: at turn8: dt=3 -> car1: [-23+36, -12+36]=[13,24] (safe)\n            Turn 9: U   # to y=4 at turn9: freeway4: [12-36*4, 47-36*4] = [12-144,47-144] = [-132,-97] (safe)\n            Turn 10: U  # to y=5 at turn10: freeway5: same as freeway4 at turn10? -> [12-36*5,47-36*5]=[-168,-133] (safe)\n            Turn 11: U  # to y=6 at turn11: freeway6: [-29+6*6, -18+6*6] = [7,18] (safe)\n            Turn 12: U  # to y=7 at turn12: freeway7: \n                    car1: [-55+4*7, -44+4*7] = [-55+28, -44+28] = [-27,-16] (safe)\n                    car2: [9+28,20+28]=[37,48] (safe)\n            Turn 13: U  # to y=8 at turn13: freeway8: [-44+3*8, -33+3*8] = [-44+24, -33+24] = [-20,-9] (safe)\n            Turn 14: U  # to y=9 at turn14 -> but wait, at turn13 we are at y=8, then we do U at turn13 to get to y=9 at turn14.\n\n            However, we don't need an action at turn14? \n\n            The last action is at turn13: U.\n\n            So the sequence has 9 actions: turns 5 to 13.\n\n        But then H=9.\n\n        However, note: we started at turn5 and did 9 actions: so the last action is at turn13, and then at turn14 we are at y=9.\n\n        The problem says: the sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1. So H=9, so we output actions for turn5 to turn5+8=13.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 9.\n\n        But let's see if we can do it in 8 actions? \n\n          We have to be at y=9 by turn13 (because if we do 8 actions, the last action is at turn12, then at turn13 we are at y=9).\n\n          How to get from y=2 to y=9 in 8 moves? \n             2 -> 9: difference 7, so we need 7 U's and possibly one wait or detour? \n             But we have to avoid collisions.\n\n          We must leave y=2 at turn5: \n             Option1: U -> to y=3 at turn6 -> unsafe.\n             Option2: D -> to y=1 at turn6 -> safe.\n             Option3: S -> unsafe.\n\n          So only D is safe.\n\n          Then at turn6: we are at y=1.\n\n          Then we need to go from y=1 to y=9 in 7 moves? (from turn6 to turn13) -> 7 U's: \n             turn6: U -> y=2 at turn7 -> safe (as above)\n             turn7: U -> y=3 at turn8 -> safe\n             turn8: U -> y=4 at turn9 -> safe\n             turn9: U -> y=5 at turn10 -> safe\n             turn10: U -> y=6 at turn11 -> safe\n             turn11: U -> y=7 at turn12 -> safe\n             turn12: U -> y=8 at turn13 -> safe\n             turn13: U -> y=9 at turn14 -> but we are at turn14, so we need an action at turn13? \n\n          But we are only allowed 8 actions? so we stop at turn12.\n\n          At turn12: we are at y=8 -> not 9.\n\n          Therefore, we cannot do it in 8 actions.\n\n        So minimal H is 9.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n          Turn 5: D\n          Turn 6: U\n          Turn 7: U\n          Turn 8: U\n          Turn 9: U\n          Turn 10: U\n          Turn 11: U\n          Turn 12: U\n          Turn 13: U\n\n        But wait: at turn13, we do U to go from y=8 to y=9 at turn14. But the problem says we are to reach (0,9). At turn14 we are at (0,9). \n\n        However, the last action is at turn13.

The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) each turn, and collisions occur if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) at turn \\(t\\) and any car on that freeway spans the x-coordinate 0 at that turn.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The player starts at position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\). The goal is to reach \\((0, 9)\\) in the fewest turns possible. The player's movement is constrained to vertical moves (up, down, or stay), and collisions must be avoided with moving cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n2. **Car Movement Simulation**: For each car on a freeway, its position at any turn \\(t\\) can be computed based on its initial position, direction, and speed. The car's span (head and tail positions) shifts linearly over time:\n   - **Right-moving cars**: The span at turn \\(t\\) is \\([\\tau + s \\cdot (t - t_1), h + s \\cdot (t - t_1)]\\).\n   - **Left-moving cars**: The span at turn \\(t\\) is \\([h - s \\cdot (t - t_1), \\tau - s \\cdot (t - t_1)]\\).\n\n3. **Collision Check**: At each turn \\(t\\), if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y \\leq 8\\)), we check if any car on that freeway spans the x-coordinate 0. If it does, the player cannot be on that freeway at that turn.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: We use BFS to explore the shortest path from the initial position \\((5, 2)\\) to any position \\((t, 9)\\). Each state in the BFS is represented as \\((t, y)\\), where \\(t\\) is the current turn and \\(y\\) is the current vertical position. From each state, the player can move up, down, or stay, generating new states \\((t+1, y')\\). The BFS ensures the first time we reach \\(y = 9\\) is via the shortest path.\n\n5. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the target \\(y = 9\\) is reached, we backtrack from \\((t, 9)\\) to the initial state \\((5, 2)\\) to construct the sequence of actions taken.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\nfreeway_cars = {\n    1: [(0, -47, 'right', 48)],\n    2: [(-12, -23, 'right', 12), (60, 49, 'right', 12)],\n    3: [(-12, -23, 'right', 12), (60, 49, 'right', 12)],\n    4: [(12, 47, 'left', 36)],\n    5: [(12, 47, 'left', 36)],\n    6: [(-18, -29, 'right', 6)],\n    7: [(-44, -55, 'right', 4), (20, 9, 'right', 4)],\n    8: [(-33, -44, 'right', 3)]\n}\n\ndef is_safe(k, t):\n    dt = t - 5\n    cars = freeway_cars.get(k, [])\n    for car in cars:\n        head0, tail0, d, s_val = car\n        if d == 'right':\n            left_end = tail0 + s_val * dt\n            right_end = head0 + s_val * dt\n        else:\n            left_end = head0 - s_val * dt\n            right_end = tail0 - s_val * dt\n        if left_end <= 0 <= right_end:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nstart_t = 5\nstart_y = 2\ngoal_y = 9\n\nvisited = set()\nparent = {}\n\nqueue = deque()\nvisited.add((start_t, start_y))\nparent[(start_t, start_y)] = (None, None, None)\nqueue.append((start_t, start_y))\n\nfound = False\nresult_state = None\n\nwhile queue:\n    t, y = queue.popleft()\n    \n    if y == goal_y:\n        found = True\n        result_state = (t, y)\n        break\n        \n    actions = []\n    if y < 9:\n        actions.append(('U', y+1))\n    if y > 0:\n        actions.append(('D', y-1))\n    actions.append(('S', y))\n    \n    for act, next_y in actions:\n        next_t = t + 1\n        if (next_t, next_y) in visited:\n            continue\n            \n        if next_y in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]:\n            if not is_safe(next_y, next_t):\n                continue\n                \n        visited.add((next_t, next_y))\n        parent[(next_t, next_y)] = (t, y, act)\n        queue.append((next_t, next_y))\n\nif not found:\n    print(\"No path found\")\nelse:\n    current = result_state\n    actions_sequence = []\n    while current != (start_t, start_y):\n        t_cur, y_cur = current\n        t_prev, y_prev, act_prev = parent[current]\n        actions_sequence.append(act_prev)\n        current = (t_prev, y_prev)\n        \n    actions_sequence.reverse()\n    \n    output_lines = []\n    for idx, act in enumerate(actions_sequence):\n        turn = start_t + idx\n        output_lines.append(f\"Turn {turn}: a_{{{turn}}} = {act}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n\".join(output_lines))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The `freeway_cars` dictionary stores the initial positions, directions, and speeds of cars on each freeway \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n2. **Safety Check**: The `is_safe` function checks if a freeway \\(k\\) is safe at turn \\(t\\) by verifying no car spans the x-coordinate 0.\n3. **BFS Setup**: The BFS starts from the initial state \\((5, 2)\\). The `visited` set tracks explored states, and the `parent` dictionary records the path.\n4. **State Exploration**: For each state \\((t, y)\\), the player considers moving up, down, or staying. Each new state \\((t+1, y')\\) is enqueued if it's safe and unvisited.\n5. **Path Reconstruction**: Upon reaching \\(y = 9\\), the sequence of actions is reconstructed by backtracking from the target state to the initial state using parent pointers.\n6. **Output**: The sequence of actions is printed for each turn from \\(t_1 = 5\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1\\), where \\(H\\) is the number of actions taken.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the shortest path while avoiding collisions by leveraging BFS to explore states in order of increasing time, ensuring optimality. The solution handles dynamic car movements and checks collisions at each turn to guarantee safety.",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, within 0 to 9. Cars move horizontally on their freeways, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway at a turn when a car spans x=0.\n\nThe key point is that collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on y_T, and for the car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that exact turn. If I move to a different y, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1 = 7, and I'm at y=2.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car positions and how they move over time.\n\nEach car has a head and tail, and direction, and speed. For left-moving cars, span is [h, τ], and it moves left, so h and τ decrease. For right-moving, span is [τ, h], and it moves right, so τ and h increase.\n\nIn the table, for freeway k, cars are listed with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nLet me list all cars clearly:\n\nFreeway 1: (96, 49, right, 48) — so head=96, tail=49? But for right-moving, it should be tail to head increasing, so if head=96, tail=49, that might imply tail is left, head is right, so as it moves right, both increase.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut for collision, I care about when the span includes x=0.\n\nSince the car moves at constant speed, I can find when 0 is in the span for each car.\n\nBut multiple cars per freeway, so I need to check for each car on a freeway when it covers x=0.\n\nFor a given freeway at turn T, if any car on that freeway has 0 in its span at T, then it's dangerous if I'm on that y at T.\n\nSince I start at turn t_1=7, I need to consider turns from t=7 onwards.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=0 for simplicity in calculations, but since t_1=7 is given, I'll use t relative to t_1.\n\nSet τ = t - t_1, so at τ=0, current turn.\n\nPlayer position: at τ=0, y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some τ=H-1? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and at turn t_1 + H - 1, y=9.\n\nDefine: let k be the step, from k=0 to H-1, action a_{t_1 + k}, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y should be 9? No.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, based on action at t.\n\nSo at turn t, action a_t determines Δy_t for y_{t+1}.\n\nStarting at turn t_1, position (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,2).\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1 +1, y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nAnd so on, until at some turn T = t_1 + H - 1, y_T = 9.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=t_1 to t=t_1 + H - 1, total H actions, and at turn t_1 + H - 1, y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, we have done H steps, and reached turn t_1 + H - 1? Let's index properly.\n\nAt time t (turn), before action, position is y_t.\n\nAction a_t is taken at turn t, which sets Δy_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, take action a_t, move to y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, at y_{t_1} = 2.\n\nWe take actions a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H - 1}, so H actions.\n\nAfter these H actions, we have y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want to reach y=9 at some turn, so y_T = 9 for T = t_1 + H - 1? No.\n\nAfter action a_t at turn t, we move to y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nSo at turn t_1, we are at y=2.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1} at turn t_1, we go to y_{t_1 +1} at turn t_1+1.\n\nSimilarly, after action a_{t_1 + H - 1} at turn t_1 + H - 1, we go to y_{t_1 + H} at turn t_1 + H.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9? But the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\".\n\nLet's read the problem:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAlso in the action sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H - 1}.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H - 1, after action a_{t_1 + H - 1}, we have y_{t_1 + H} = y_{t_1 + H - 1} + Δy_{t_1 + H - 1}, but we want y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} is the position at the beginning of turn t_1 + H - 1, before action.\n\nThen we take action a_{t_1 + H - 1}, which may change y for the next turn.\n\nBut we want to be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1, meaning at that turn, we are on y=9.\n\nSo at turn T = t_1 + H - 1, y_T = 9.\n\nThen we take action a_T, but that affects y_{T+1}, not y_T.\n\nSo for the position at turn T, it is y_T, which is determined by previous actions.\n\nTo have y_T = 9 at turn T, we need to arrive there by the action at T-1 or stay.\n\nBut since we start at t_1 with y=2, we need a sequence to move to y=9 by turn T.\n\nThe minimal H is the number of actions to achieve this.\n\nH is the number of turns from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, so the time span is H turns, but the position is reached at the end of the H-th action or something.\n\nLet's clarify:\n\n- At turn t_1: position y=2\n\n- Take action a_{t_1}: move to y_{t_1+1} = y_2 + Δy_{t_1} at turn t_1+1\n\n- At turn t_1+1: position y_{t_1+1}\n\n- ...\n\n- Take action a_{t_1 + k} at turn t_1+k: move to y_{t_1+k+1} at turn t_1+k+1\n\nWe want for some T, at turn T, y_T = 9.\n\nT = t_1 + H - 1, so H-1 is the number of steps from t_1 to T.\n\nSince at t_1, we are at turn t_1, and we want to be at y=9 at turn T, with T = t_1 + M for some M.\n\nThen H-1 = M, so H = M+1.\n\nThe sequence has H actions from t=t_1 to t=t_1+H-1, and at turn t_1+H-1, y=9.\n\nSo for example, if H=1, one action: a_{t_1}, then at turn t_1, we are at y=2, we take action, but y_{t_1} is 2, not 9, unless we are already at 9, but we are at 2.\n\nIf we want to be at y=9 at turn t_1, we need to be there initially, but we are at 2, so impossible with H=0 actions? But H is the number of actions, so min H is at least the distance in y.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9, we need at least 7 steps up, since each U increases y by 1, but we can stay or go down, but min steps is 7 U actions.\n\nBut with cars, it might take longer if we have to wait.\n\nBut H is the number of actions to reach at turn t_1 + H - 1 with y=9.\n\nSo let's define T = turn relative to t_1, so at T=0, turn t_1, y=2.\n\nWe take actions for T=0 to K-1, so K actions, and at turn T=K, y_K =9.\n\nT from 0 to K, with K = H-1? Let's see.\n\nSet τ = turn index from t_1, so τ=0: turn t_1, y=2\n\nτ=1: turn t_1+1, y = y_0 + Δy_0\n\n...\n\nAt turn τ, y_τ.\n\nWe want y_τ =9 for some τ.\n\nThe actions are a_τ for τ=0 to τ=H-1, and at turn H-1, y_{H-1} =9? No.\n\nAt turn τ, position y_τ is before action a_τ.\n\nAfter a_τ, we have y_{τ+1}.\n\nWe start at τ=0, y_0=2.\n\nWe take a_0, then y_1 = y_0 + Δa_0\n\nTake a_1, y2 = y1 + Δa_1\n\n...\n\nTake a_{H-1}, then y_H = y_{H-1} + Δa_{H-1}\n\nBut we want at turn τ for some τ, y_τ =9.\n\nSpecifically, at turn t_1 + H - 1, which is τ = H-1, y_{H-1} =9.\n\nThen we take action a_{H-1}, which may change y, but at that turn, we are at y=9.\n\nSo for the position at turn τ=H-1, y_{H-1} =9.\n\nTo achieve that, we need to move from y=2 at τ=0 to y=9 at τ=H-1.\n\nThe number of actions is H, from τ=0 to τ=H-1.\n\nThe time from start to reach is H turns: from τ=0 to τ=H-1.\n\nMin H such that we can be at y=9 at turn H-1.\n\nSince y changes by at most 1 per turn, min H-1 >= 7, so H >=8, since from 2 to 9 is 7 steps, so at least 7 actions to increase y by 7, so min τ to reach is at least 7, so at τ=7, y=9 possible if all U, but with cars, may take longer.\n\nH-1 is the turn index when we reach, so min H-1 >=7, so H>=8.\n\nH is the number of actions, so for example, if we reach at τ=7, then H-1=7, so H=8 actions from τ=0 to 7.\n\nActions at τ=0 to 7, 8 actions, to reach at τ=7.\n\ny at τ=7 is after 7 actions from τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, y0=2.\n\nAfter a0, y1 at τ=1\n\n...\n\nAfter a6, y7 at τ=7\n\nTo have y7=9, we need 7 U actions, for example.\n\nBut with S or D, it takes more turns.\n\nMin H-1=7, so min H=8.\n\nBut with obstacles, we may need to wait, so H could be larger.\n\nNow, I need to find a path from y=2 to y=9 in min turns, avoiding being on a freeway y when at that turn, a car covers x=0 on that freeway.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8, so when I am on y=1 to 8 at turn τ, I must not collide, meaning that for that y, at τ, no car on that freeway has 0 in its span.\n\nIf I am on y=0 or y=9, no freeway, so no collision, but y=9 is the goal, and y=0 is the bottom, but we can be there, no problem.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nCars are only on y=1 to 8.\n\nSo when I am on y=k for k=1 to 8 at turn τ, I need that for freeway k, at turn τ, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nThe span depends on the initial position at t_1=7 and the speed, and time elapsed.\n\nt_1=7 is given, so at turn t, relative to t_1, τ = t - t_1.\n\nFor a car, at turn t, span is based on initial at t_1 and speed s.\n\nFor a left-moving car, initial at t_1, span [h, τ], so at time t, span [h - s(t - t_1), τ - s(t - t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: initial [τ, h], at t, [τ + s(t - t_1), h + s(t - t_1)]\n\nThen 0 in span if min <=0<= max.\n\nFor left-moving, min is h - s(t-t_1), max is τ - s(t-t_1), but since it's [h, τ] with h > τ for left-moving? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] -> at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut [h, τ] with h and τ, which is head and tail. For left-moving, head is left or right?\n\nIt says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\", and for left-moving, it moves left, so head decreases.\n\nTypically, head might be the front, so for left-moving, head is on the left, tail on the right.\n\nIn the span [h, τ], if it's left-moving, h should be the left end, τ the right end? But it says \"head at h, tail at τ\", and for left-moving, when it moves left, head decreases.\n\nIn the example: freeway 4: (-60, -25, left, 36), so h=-60, τ=-25, so span from -60 to -25, which is from left to right? -60 is left of -25, so min x is -60, max x is -25.\n\nThen at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)] = [-60 -36(T-t_1), -25 -36(T-t_1)], so both decrease, moving left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, freeway 1: (96,49, right,48), head=96, tail=49, so span from 49 to 96, I think, but it says for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so [49,96], and at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [49+48(T-t_1), 96+48(T-t_1)].\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), but for right-moving, head is larger if moving right, I assume.\n\nIn freeway 2: (12,1,right,12), so head=12, tail=1, so for right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [1,12], I think.\n\nSimilarly, for collision, 0 in span at turn T for the freeway.\n\nAlso, note that for a freeway, there might be multiple cars, so I need to check all for that freeway.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when it is dangerous, i.e., when 0 is covered by some car at that turn.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need the union of spans.\n\nBut for simplicity, for each freeway, I can find the times when 0 is not covered, so it's safe to be on that y at that turn.\n\nThen I can plan a path through the y levels over time.\n\ny from 0 to 9, time τ from 0 onwards.\n\nAt each τ, for each y, if y=0 or 9, always safe.\n\nIf y=1 to 8, safe only if at that τ, for freeway y, 0 not in any car's span.\n\nThen I can find the safe states and find a shortest path from (τ=0,y=2) to (τ,y=9) for some τ.\n\nMin τ such that y=9 is reached.\n\nSince we move at most 1 per turn, min τ to reach from y=2 to y=9 is 7, if no obstacles.\n\nBut with obstacles, τ >=7.\n\nI need to compute for each freeway the dangerous times.\n\nFirst, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car (96,49,right,48)\n\nAt time τ (relative to t_1, so t = t_1 + τ), span at τ: since right-moving, [τ + s τ, h + s τ] with s=48, τ=0 at t_1.\n\nAt t = t_1 + τ, span is [τ_init + s τ, h_init + s τ]\n\nInitial at t_1: for this car, tail=49, head=96, so [49,96] at τ=0.\n\nAt time τ (elapsed), span [49 + 48τ, 96 + 48τ]\n\n0 in span if 49 +48τ <= 0 <= 96 +48τ\n\nBut 49+48τ >0 for τ>=0, since 49>0, so 49+48τ >=49>0, so 0 < min, so 0 not in span for any τ>=0. So never covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly, 96+48τ >0 always. So freeway 1 is always safe? 49+48τ >0 for all τ, so min is at least 49, so 0 not in [49+48τ, 96+48τ] since min >0. So yes, never covers x=0. So freeway 1 is always safe.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars: (12,1,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (12,1,right,12) -> at τ=0, span [1,12] (since [τ,h] = [1,12])\n\nAt time τ, [1 + 12τ, 12 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span if 1+12τ <=0 <=12+12τ\n\n1+12τ <=0 => τ <= -1/12, impossible for τ>=0.\n\n1+12τ >=1>0, so min>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-36,-47,right,12) -> at τ=0, span [τ,h] = [-47,-36]? head=-36, tail=-47, but for right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [-47,-36], since tail=-47, head=-36, so from -47 to -36.\n\nAt time τ, [ -47 +12τ, -36 +12τ ]\n\n0 in span if -47+12τ <=0 <= -36+12τ\n\nFirst inequality: -47+12τ <=0 => 12τ <=47 => τ <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so τ <=3 since τ integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -36+12τ => 12τ >=36 => τ >=3\n\nSo for τ=3, -47+36 = -11 <=0, and -36+36=0 <=0, so 0 in [-11,0] at τ=3.\n\n-36+12τ at τ=3: -36+36=0, so 0 <=0 <=0, yes, included.\n\nFor τ>3, min = -47+12τ, at τ=4, -47+48=1>0, so min>0, 0 not in span.\n\nFor τ<3, max = -36+12τ, at τ=2, -36+24= -12<0, so max<0, 0 not in span.\n\nSo only at τ=3, for this car, 0 in span.\n\nBut freeway 2 has two cars. First car never covers 0, as min=1+12τ>0.\n\nSecond car covers 0 only at τ=3.\n\nSo freeway 2 is dangerous only at τ=3, when second car covers 0.\n\nOther times safe.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"3 | (12,1,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12) |\"\n\nIdentical to freeway 2, so same: dangerous only at τ=3.\n\nFreeway 4: (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nLeft-moving: at τ=0, span [h,τ] = [-60,-25]\n\nAt time τ, [h - s τ, τ - s τ] = [-60 -36τ, -25 -36τ]\n\n0 in span if -60-36τ <=0 <= -25-36τ\n\nFirst inequality always true since left side negative.\n\nSecond: 0 <= -25-36τ? -25-36τ <= -25 <0, so 0 <= negative number? No, 0 > -25-36τ for all τ, so 0 not <= max, since max = -25-36τ <0.\n\nSo min <=0 but max <0, so 0 not in [min,max] since max<0.\n\nSimilarly, min is decreasing, always negative, max negative, so 0 never in span. Safe always.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4: (-60,-25,left,36), so same, always safe.\n\nFreeway 6: (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nRight-moving: head=-6, tail=-17? So at τ=0, span [τ,h] = [-17,-6]\n\nAt time τ, [-17 +6τ, -6 +6τ]\n\n0 in span if -17+6τ <=0 <= -6+6τ\n\nFirst: -17+6τ <=0 => 6τ <=17 => τ <= 17/6 ≈ 2.833, so τ <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -6+6τ => 6τ >=6 => τ >=1\n\nSo for τ=1: min= -17+6= -11 <=0, max= -6+6=0 <=0, so 0 in [-11,0]\n\nτ=2: min= -17+12= -5 <=0, max= -6+12=6 >=0, so 0 in [-5,6]\n\nτ=3: min= -17+18=1>0, so not.\n\nSo dangerous at τ=1 and τ=2.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-36,-47,right,4) and (28,17,right,4)\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,4) -> at τ=0, span [τ,h] = [-47,-36]\n\nAt τ, [-47 +4τ, -36 +4τ]\n\n0 in span if -47+4τ <=0 <= -36+4τ\n\n-47+4τ <=0 => 4τ <=47 => τ <= 11.75, τ<=11\n\n0 <= -36+4τ => 4τ >=36 => τ >=9\n\nSo for τ=9: min= -47+36= -11 <=0, max= -36+36=0 <=0, 0 in span\n\nτ=10: min= -47+40= -7 <=0, max= -36+40=4 >=0, 0 in span\n\nτ=11: min= -47+44= -3 <=0, max= -36+44=8 >=0, 0 in span\n\nτ=12: min= -47+48=1>0, not\n\nNow second car: (28,17,right,4) -> at τ=0, span [τ,h] = [17,28]\n\nAt τ, [17+4τ, 28+4τ], min=17+4τ >=17>0, so never covers 0.\n\nSo for freeway 7, first car dangerous at τ=9,10,11; second car never. So dangerous at τ=9,10,11.\n\nFreeway 8: (-27,-38,right,3)\n\nAt τ=0, span [τ,h] = [-38,-27]\n\nAt τ, [-38 +3τ, -27 +3τ]\n\n0 in span if -38+3τ <=0 <= -27+3τ\n\nFirst: -38+3τ <=0 => 3τ <=38 => τ <= 12.666, τ<=12\n\nSecond: 0 <= -27+3τ => 3τ >=27 => τ >=9\n\nSo τ=9: min= -38+27= -11 <=0, max= -27+27=0 <=0, 0 in\n\nτ=10: min= -38+30= -8 <=0, max= -27+30=3 >=0\n\nτ=11: min= -38+33= -5 <=0, max= -27+33=6 >=0\n\nτ=12: min= -38+36= -2 <=0, max= -27+36=9 >=0\n\nτ=13: min= -38+39=1>0, not\n\nSo dangerous at τ=9,10,11,12.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, dangerous times:\n\ny=1: freeway 1, always safe\n\ny=2: freeway 2, dangerous at τ=3 only\n\ny=3: freeway 3, dangerous at τ=3 only\n\ny=4: freeway 4, always safe\n\ny=5: freeway 5, always safe\n\ny=6: freeway 6, dangerous at τ=1 and τ=2\n\ny=7: freeway 7, dangerous at τ=9,10,11\n\ny=8: freeway 8, dangerous at τ=9,10,11,12\n\nAlso, y=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nI need to go from (τ=0, y=2) to some (τ, y=9) with min τ.\n\ny=9 is safe always, so once I reach, I can stay or whatever, but since it's the goal, I just need to be there.\n\nNow, movements: at each step, I can change y by -1,0,+1, within 0-9.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nBut there are dangerous times on some y.\n\nSince y=1,4,5 are always safe, I can use them to avoid dangers.\n\ny=2 dangerous only at τ=3, so at other times safe.\n\nSimilarly y=3 dangerous only at τ=3.\n\ny=6 dangerous at τ=1,2.\n\ny=7 dangerous at τ=9-11, y=8 at τ=9-12.\n\nTo go from y=2 to y=9, min 7 steps, so earliest possible at τ=7, if all U.\n\nBut let's see if possible.\n\nAt τ=0, y=2, which is safe since dangerous only at τ=3, not now.\n\nI can go up to y=3 or down to y=1 or stay.\n\ny=1 is safe, y=3 at τ=0 is safe since dangerous only at τ=3.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut y=6 is dangerous at τ=1 and 2, so I need to avoid being on y=6 at τ=1 or 2.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and 8 dangerous later.\n\nFirst, let's list safe (τ,y) for y=1-8.\n\nFor y=1: always safe\n\ny=2: safe except τ=3\n\ny=3: safe except τ=3\n\ny=4: always safe\n\ny=5: always safe\n\ny=6: safe except τ=1,2\n\ny=7: safe except τ=9,10,11\n\ny=8: safe except τ=9,10,11,12\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from (0,2) to (τ,9) min τ.\n\nSince I can move one per turn, to reach y=9, I need at least τ=7 to have y=9.\n\nAt τ=7, y=9 possible only if I increase by 7 in 7 steps.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFirst, avoid being on y=6 at τ=1 or 2.\n\nAlso, y=2 and y=3 dangerous at τ=3.\n\nNow, since y=4 and 5 are always safe, I might go through them.\n\nLet me try to go directly up.\n\nSuppose at τ=0, y=2, safe.\n\nI can go U to y=3 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=3: is it safe? y=3 dangerous only at τ=3, not τ=1, so safe.\n\nFrom y=3 at τ=1, I can go U to y=4 at τ=2.\n\ny=4 always safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=4, go U to y=5 at τ=3.\n\ny=5 always safe.\n\nAt τ=3, y=5, safe.\n\nNow, from here, I need to go to y=6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=6 is dangerous at τ=1 and 2, which have passed, so at τ=3, y=6 is safe? y=6 dangerous at τ=1,2, so at τ=3, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and 8 dangerous later, not now.\n\nSo at τ=3, y=5, I can go U to y=6 at τ=4.\n\ny=6 at τ=4: safe, since dangerous only τ=1,2.\n\nThen U to y=7 at τ=5.\n\ny=7 at τ=5: dangerous only at τ=9,10,11, so τ=5 safe.\n\nU to y=8 at τ=6.\n\ny=8 at τ=6: dangerous τ=9-12, so safe now.\n\nThen U to y=9 at τ=7.\n\ny=9 at τ=7, safe.\n\nNow, we reached y=9 at τ=7.\n\nBut τ is turn index, from start.\n\nAt τ=0, turn t_1, y=2\n\nAt τ=1, y=3\n\nτ=2, y=4\n\nτ=3, y=5\n\nτ=4, y=6\n\nτ=5, y=7\n\nτ=6, y=8\n\nτ=7, y=9\n\nAnd actions: from τ=0 to τ=6, actions to move to next y.\n\nAt each step, action at τ determines y_{τ+1}.\n\nAt turn τ, position y_τ, take action a_τ, go to y_{τ+1}.\n\nIn this case:\n\nAt τ=0, y=2, take U, go to y=3 at τ=1\n\nAt τ=1, y=3, take U, go to y=4 at τ=2\n\nAt τ=2, y=4, take U, go to y=5 at τ=3\n\nAt τ=3, y=5, take U, go to y=6 at τ=4\n\nAt τ=4, y=6, take U, go to y=7 at τ=5\n\nAt τ=5, y=7, take U, go to y=8 at τ=6\n\nAt τ=6, y=8, take U, go to y=9 at τ=7\n\nNow, at τ=7, we are at y=9, which is the goal turn.\n\nτ=7 is turn t_1 +7.\n\nIn terms of H, we reached at τ=H-1=7, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=7? No.\n\nActions: a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nHere, actions taken at τ=0 to 6, to reach y at τ=7.\n\nSo actions at turns: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+6, so 7 actions, H=7? But we reached at τ=7, which is after 7 actions? Let's count.\n\nStart: turn t_1, τ=0, y=2\n\nAfter action a_{t_1} (at τ=0), y=3 at τ=1\n\nAfter a_{t_1+1} (at τ=1), y=4 at τ=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t_1+6} (at τ=6), y=9 at τ=7\n\nAt turn τ=7, y=9, which is turn t_1 +7.\n\nThe turn we reach is t_1 +7, which is τ=7.\n\nIn the problem, we want to reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nHere t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +7, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nBut with H=8 actions, actions from t_1 to t_1+7, but above we have actions only up to t_1+6.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nDefine:\n\nLet the reach turn be T = t_1 + M, so at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nM is the number of turns after start.\n\nAt start, turn t_1, y=2.\n\nAfter k actions, we are at turn t_1 + k, y_{t_1 + k}.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t_1, y=2.\n\nAfter 1 action (at t_1), at turn t_1+1, y= something.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k.\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T=9.\n\nT = t_1 + M, so after M actions, at turn t_1 + M, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + M -1}, because:\n\n- Action a_{t_1} at turn t_1, moves to y_{t_1+1}\n\n- Action a_{t_1+1} at turn t_1+1, moves to y_{t_1+2}\n\n- ...\n\n- Action a_{t_1 + K} at turn t_1+K, moves to y_{t_1+K+1}\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + M} =9, we need actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + M -1}, so M actions? Number of actions is M.\n\nAfter M actions, we are at turn t_1 + M.\n\nThe sequence has actions from index t_1 to t_1 + M -1, so M actions.\n\nAnd we reach at turn t_1 + M.\n\nBut in the problem, it says reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo t_1 + H -1 = t_1 + M, so H-1 = M, H = M+1.\n\nIn my earlier, I reached at τ=7, so M=7, turn t_1+7.\n\nThen H-1=7, H=8.\n\nActions: from t=0 to H-1=7, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+7}.\n\nBut in my path, with 7 actions (from τ=0 to 6), I reached at τ=7.\n\nSo for H=8, actions from τ=0 to 7, but at τ=7, I am already at y=9, and I take an action, but I don't need to, but I can take S or something.\n\nIn the sequence, it includes actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and at that turn, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn my case, at turn τ=7, y=9, so I need to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor H-1=7, so at turn t_1+7, y=9.\n\nThen actions from t_1 to t_1+6, to move to y=9 at turn t_1+7.\n\nIn the action sequence, actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2} for moving, and at turn t_1 + H -1, I am at y=9, and I take action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which could be S, U, or D, but since y=9, U would go to 10, but y=9 is max, so if I go U, y=10 invalid, so I must not go U, but S or D.\n\nBut since I am at y=9, I can take S to stay.\n\nIn the sequence, for the last action, I can take S.\n\nIn my path, with actions from τ=0 to 6: all U, I reach y=9 at τ=7.\n\nThen for the sequence, I need actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, with H-1=7, so actions from t_1 to t_1+6 and also a_{t_1+7} at turn t_1+7.\n\nAt turn t_1+7, I am at y=9, and I take action, say S, to stay at y=9.\n\nSo the actions include an extra S at the end, but since I already reached, it doesn't change the position.\n\nBut min H, with H=8 actions to reach at turn t_1+7.\n\nI could have reached earlier? Min τ=7, so H min is 8.\n\nBut in this path, is it safe?\n\nIn the path: at each turn, when I am on y, is it safe?\n\nTurn τ=0: at y=2, safe, since dangerous only τ=3.\n\nAction U, to y=3 at τ=1.\n\nτ=1: at y=3, safe? y=3 dangerous only at τ=3, not τ=1, so safe.\n\nAction U, to y=4 at τ=2.\n\nτ=2: at y=4, always safe.\n\nAction U, to y=5 at τ=3.\n\nτ=3: at y=5, always safe.\n\nAction U, to y=6 at τ=4.\n\nNow, at τ=4, I am at y=6? Position at turn τ is y_τ.\n\nAt τ=3, I am at y=5, take U, so at τ=4, I am at y=6.\n\nNow, at τ=4, y=6: is it safe? y=6 dangerous at τ=1 and 2, not at τ=4, so safe.\n\nThen action U, to y=7 at τ=5.\n\nτ=5: y=7, dangerous at τ=9,10,11, not τ=5, so safe.\n\nAction U, to y=8 at τ=6.\n\nτ=6: y=8, dangerous at τ=9-12, not τ=6, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=9 at τ=7.\n\nτ=7: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut I have to specify the actions.\n\nActions: at each turn τ, action a_τ.\n\nFrom above:\n\nAt turn τ=0: action U (to go to y=3)\n\nAt τ=1: action U (to y=4)\n\nAt τ=2: action U (to y=5)\n\nAt τ=3: action U (to y=6)\n\nAt τ=4: action U (to y=7)\n\nAt τ=5: action U (to y=8)\n\nAt τ=6: action U (to y=9)\n\nAt τ=7: I need to be at y=9 and take action. Since y=9, I can take S to stay.\n\nBut at turn τ=7, I am at y=9, take action a_{t_1+7}, which is at turn t_1+7.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nWith H=8, actions at t_1 to t_1+7.\n\nAt t_1+7, I take action, but I am already at y=9.\n\nSo for the path, actions: a_{t_1} = U (from y=2 to 3)\n\na_{t_1+1} = U (to y=4)\n\n...\n\nup to a_{t_1+6} = U (to y=9 at turn t_1+7)\n\nThen at turn t_1+7, I am at y=9, and I need to take action a_{t_1+7}, which could be S.\n\nSo the sequence has 8 actions: 7 U and one S at the end.\n\nBut since I reached at turn t_1+7, and H-1=7, so it's fine.\n\nI could have taken only 7 actions, but the sequence must include actions until the reach turn.\n\nIn this case, min H is 8, since min 7 steps to increase y.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier? No, because from y=2 to y=9, need at least 7 increases, so min turn to reach is 7, so H min=8.\n\nBut with obstacles, if I have to detour, it might take longer, but here I didn't need to.\n\nIn this path, I didn't hit any danger, so it should be fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the dangerous times.\n\nAt τ=0, y=2: safe\n\nτ=1, y=3: safe\n\nτ=2, y=4: safe\n\nτ=3, y=5: safe\n\nτ=4, y=6: safe (danger only τ=1,2)\n\nτ=5, y=7: safe (danger τ=9-11)\n\nτ=6, y=8: safe (danger τ=9-12)\n\nτ=7, y=9: safe\n\nAll good.\n\nBut at τ=3, y=5, which is safe, and I go to y=6 at τ=4.\n\nCould I reach faster? No, min 7 turns.\n\nBut is y=6 available earlier? At τ=1 and 2, y=6 is dangerous, so I cannot be on y=6 at τ=1 or 2.\n\nIn my path, I am on y=6 at τ=4, which is fine.\n\nI could go slower, but no need.\n\nAnother path: suppose I go down to y=1 first, but that would take more turns, worse.\n\nOr stay, but no benefit.\n\nSo this seems optimal.\n\nBut let me check if I can reach at τ=6 or something, but from y=2 to y=9 in 6 turns? Only if I increase by more than 1, but I can only change by 1 per turn, so impossible. Min 7 turns, so reach at τ=7.\n\nThus H=8.\n\nNow, the actions: for turns t_1 to t_1+7.\n\nt_1=7, but we use relative.\n\nIn answer, we need to write actions for each turn.\n\nAlso, in the sequence, at turn t_1+7, I need to take an action, but since I am at y=9, I should take S.\n\nBut in the action list, it must be specified.\n\nPerhaps I can reach and take action at the same turn, but no.\n\nIn this case, with 7 U actions from t_1 to t_1+6, I reach y=9 at t_1+7.\n\nThen at t_1+7, I take S.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1+1: U\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1+6: U\n\nTurn t_1+7: S\n\nBut H=8 actions.\n\nIn the box, we need to write for each turn.\n\nt_1=7.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nAt turn 14, y=9, take S.\n\nBut is turn 14 safe? Yes.\n\nBut let me verify the car positions at critical points.\n\nFor example, at τ=3, which is turn t_1+3=10.\n\nAt turn 10, where am I?\n\nτ=0: turn7, y=2\n\nAfter U, τ=1: turn8, y=3\n\nU, τ=2: turn9, y=4\n\nU, τ=3: turn10, y=5\n\ny=5, freeway 5, always safe, no car covers x=0.\n\nThen at τ=4, turn11, y=6\n\ny=6, freeway 6, dangerous at τ=1 and 2, which are turns 8 and 9? τ=1 is turn8, τ=2 turn9.\n\nAt turn11, τ=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn12, τ=5, y=7, freeway 7 dangerous at τ=9,10,11, τ=5 is not, safe.\n\nτ=9,10,11 relative to t_1.\n\nt_1=7, so τ=9 is turn16, τ=10 turn17, etc.\n\nEarlier:\n\ny=7 dangerous at τ=9,10,11, which is turn t_1+9=16, t_1+10=17, t_1+11=18.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=5, turn12, not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, turn13, τ=6, y=8, dangerous at τ=9-12, i.e., turns 16 to 19, not turn13.\n\nTurn14, τ=7, y=9, safe.\n\nAll fine.\n\nBut in the action at turn14, S, but since it's the last, and we reached, it's ok.\n\nBut min H is 8.\n\nBut is there a way with H smaller? H=8 means 8 actions, reach at turn t_1+7=14.\n\nIf I could reach at turn t_1+6=13, then H-1=6, so H=7.\n\nBut from y=2 to y=9, min 7 steps, so at turn t_1+7=14, y=9 earliest possible.\n\nAt turn t_1+6=13, y at most 2+6=8 if all U, or less, cannot be 9.\n\nSo impossible to reach before turn 14.\n\nThus min H=8.\n\nAnd the path works.\n\nBut in the freeways, for y=2 and y=3, dangerous at τ=3, turn10.\n\nIn my path, at turn10, I am at y=5, not on y=2 or 3, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can go through y=4 and 5 faster, but no.\n\nAnother thing: at τ=1 and 2, y=6 dangerous, but I am not on y=6 at that time; I am on y=3 and 4.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U from turn 7 to 13, and S at turn 14.\n\nBut actions:\n\nTurn 7: U (from y=2 to 3 at turn8)\n\nTurn 8: U (to y=4 at turn9)\n\nTurn 9: U (to y=5 at turn10)\n\nTurn 10: U (to y=6 at turn11)\n\nTurn 11: U (to y=7 at turn12)\n\nTurn 12: U (to y=8 at turn13)\n\nTurn 13: U (to y=9 at turn14)\n\nThen at turn14, I am at y=9, and I need to take action, so a_{14}: S, to stay at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, it includes up to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{14}.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut H=8, actions from t=7 to 14.\n\nt_1=7, so turns: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+7.\n\nIn the box:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nBut at turn 13, action U to go to y=9 at turn14.\n\nAt turn14, action S to stay.\n\nAnd we are done.\n\nPerhaps I don't need the S, but the sequence must have H actions until the reach turn.\n\nIn this case, since at turn14, I take S, but I could take nothing, but it must be specified.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nTo avoid the extra action, but since min H requires reaching at turn t_1+7, and action at that turn, it must be included.\n\nAnother way: if I reach at turn t_1+6, but I can't.\n\nSo this is min.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought about freeway 1,4,5 always safe, which I used.\n\ny=6 has danger early, but I passed after.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, suppose I go to y=1 first.\n\nAt τ=0, y=2, take D to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=1, safe.\n\nThen I can go U to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nBut y=2 at τ=2: safe, since dangerous only τ=3.\n\nThen U to y=3 at τ=3, but y=3 dangerous at τ=3, so collision!\n\nAt τ=3, if on y=3, dangerous.\n\nIn this case, at τ=3, if I am on y=3, I collide.\n\nIn my first path, I was on y=5 at τ=3, safe.\n\nIf I go to y=1 at τ=1, then to y=2 at τ=2, then at τ=3, if I go to y=3, I collide; if I stay at y=2, also collide since y=2 dangerous at τ=3; if go down to y=1, safe, but then I waste time.\n\nWorse than direct path.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, the direct path is best.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 8.\n\nSequence as above.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=7.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is S at turn 14.\n\nSince the goal is to reach at turn 14, and we do, it's fine.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) is 8, with the sequence of actions starting from turn 7 to turn 14.\n\nThe sequence of actions is determined to avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) based on the car states at turn 7.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 8.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car positions and how they move. The cars are given for each freeway, and they move left or right at their speeds. Since the collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe player position is updated before the car positions, I think. Let me read carefully.\n\nThe player update is: at turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}. So at turn t, the player is at y_t, and after action, moves to y_{t+1}.\n\nNow, collision at turn T: it says collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\n\ny_T is the player's y-position at turn T.\n\nAnd it says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will not be considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you avoid collision if cars on y_{T+1} have 0 in Span(T) but not Span(T+1), but since you're not on y_{T+1} at T, it might not matter.\n\nLet me parse this.\n\nAt turn T, player is at y_T. Then, after action a_T, player moves to y_{T+1}.\n\nThe collision check is at turn T: if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T at turn T, then collision.\n\nThe note says: if you move to a different freeway at turn T, meaning y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, you are on y_T, not on y_{T+1}, so for collision on y_{T+1}, it only matters at turn T+1 when you are there, not at turn T.\n\nThe note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on y_T, so only cars on y_T matter for collision at T.\n\nAt turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so cars on y_{T+1} matter at T+1.\n\nIf at turn T, you are moving to y_{T+1}, but at the time of turn T, you are still on y_T, so collision is checked based on y_T and cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1 are checked.\n\nThe span at turn T is given for each car based on initial turn t_1.\n\nIn this case, t_1 = 8, so for any future turn T, we can compute the car positions relative to t_1.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t_0 = 8.\n\nSo at turn T, for a car, the span is:\n\nFor left-moving: [h - s*(T - t_0), τ - s*(T - t_0)]? Let's see the notation.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T - t_1), τ - s*(T - t_1)]\n\nIn the input, for freeway k, cars are given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nDirection: right or left.\n\nFor left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and since it's moving left, h and τ decrease over time.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, head is at h, tail at τ, and since moving left, head is to the left? I think I need to interpret the coordinates.\n\nThe freeway is like a number line, x-axis, and cars occupy intervals.\n\nFor left-moving car, at t_1, head is at h, tail at τ, and since moving left, as time increases, both head and tail decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head and tail increase.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and h and τ are positions, with h being the left end? Or right end?\n\nIt says: for left-moving, \"head is at h, tail is at τ\", and span is [h, τ], but when moving left, if head is the front, then for left-moving, head should be on the left, so [h, τ] with h < τ? But in the example, let's see.\n\nLook at freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so moving right.\n\nSpan(t_1) = [τ, h]? No.\n\nFor right-moving, it says: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nAnd for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the text: for left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the right-moving case, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is the tail, h is the head, and since moving right, head is to the right, so τ < h, so [τ, h] is from tail to head.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], so h is head, τ is tail, and for left-moving, head is left, tail is right? Or what?\n\nIf moving left, and head is at h, tail at τ, and span [h, τ], then if the car is moving left, the head should be decreasing, so if h is the leftmost point, then for left-moving, as time increases, h decreases, τ decreases, so [h, τ] with h < τ? But in the notation, it's [h, τ], and for left-moving, h - s dt, τ - s dt, so if h < τ, then after moving left, the interval shifts left.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ < h, shifts right.\n\nBut in the input, let's check the values.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-95, -48]? But it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed) = (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nHead is -48, tail is -95.\n\nSince moving right, head should be to the right, so tail at -95, head at -48, so τ = -95, h = -48, so τ < h, span [τ, h] = [-95, -48].\n\nAt turn T, Span(T) = [ -95 + 48*(T-8), -48 + 48*(T-8) ] because s=48, t_1=8.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, e.g. freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nHead=48, tail=83, direction left.\n\nSpan(t_1) = [h, τ] = [48, 83]\n\nSince moving left, Span(T) = [48 - 36*(T-8), 83 - 36*(T-8)]\n\nNow, for collision: at turn T, if player is at (0, y_T), then for freeway k = y_T, if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in Span(T) for that car.\n\nSince the player is at x=0, and collision if 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nPlayer is always at x=0, so we care about whether 0 is covered by a car on the current freeway at that turn.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=3, turn t=8.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, which is above, so we need to move up.\n\nBut there are cars on y=1 to 8, so we need to avoid times when a car is covering x=0 on the freeway we are on.\n\nSince we move vertically, we are only on one freeway per turn, and we check that freeway for collision.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9) as soon as possible.\n\ny=9 is the target, and it's not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, y=9 is the top, both have no cars, so when we are at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nThe player position: y_t from 0 to 9, inclusive.\n\nAt turn T, if y_T = 0 or y_T = 9, no collision, since no freeway there.\n\nOnly on y=1 to 8, we have cars.\n\nNow, from y=3 to y=9, we need to go up, but we might need to wait or move down to avoid cars.\n\nBut since we want minimal turns, probably we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid the times when cars are at x=0.\n\nFirst, I need to find for each freeway and each turn, whether there is a car covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nt_0 = 8 is current turn, so we start from turn 8.\n\nAt turn 8, player is at y=3.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions for t=8,9,10,... until we reach y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions a_t for t starting from t_1=8.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions from turn t_1 onwards.\n\nNow, let's list all cars on each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (head, tail, dir, speed) = (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so Span(t) = [τ + s(t-8), h + s(t-8)] with τ = tail = -95, h = head = -48, s=48.\n\nSpan at turn t: [ -95 + 48(t-8), -48 + 48(t-8) ]\n\n0 in span if -95 + 48(t-8) ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 48(t-8)\n\nSince the interval is [low, high] with low = -95 + 48(t-8), high = -48 + 48(t-8)\n\n0 in [low, high] if low ≤ 0 ≤ high.\n\nSo -95 + 48(t-8) ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 48(t-8)\n\nFirst inequality: -95 + 48(t-8) ≤ 0 => 48(t-8) ≤ 95 => t-8 ≤ 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so t-8 ≤ 1 since t integer.\n\nt-8 ≤ floor(95/48) = 1, since 48*1=48, 48*2=96>95, so t-8 <=1.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -48 + 48(t-8) => 48(t-8) ≥ 48 => t-8 ≥ 1.\n\nSo both: t-8 ≥1 and t-8 ≤1, so t-8 =1.\n\nThus, only at t=9, 0 is in span.\n\nAt t=9: low = -95 + 48(1) = -95+48= -47, high= -48+48=0, so [ -47, 0 ], 0 is included, yes.\n\nAt t=8: low = -95 +0 = -95, high= -48, both negative, 0 not in [-95,-48].\n\nAt t=10: low= -95+96=1, high= -48+96=48, both positive, 0 not in [1,48].\n\nSo on freeway 1, collision only at t=9.\n\nNow, freeway 2: two cars: (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (head=24, tail=13, right, s=12)\n\nDirection right, so Span(t) = [τ + s(t-8), h + s(t-8)] with τ=tail=13, h=head=24? But tail should be less than head if moving right.\n\nhead=24, tail=13, but 13<24, so tail=13, head=24, so τ=13, h=24.\n\nSpan(t) = [13 + 12(t-8), 24 + 12(t-8)]\n\n0 in span if 13 + 12(t-8) ≤ 0 ≤ 24 + 12(t-8)\n\nFirst: 13 + 12(dt) ≤ 0 => 12(dt) ≤ -13, but dt = t-8 ≥0, so 12(dt) ≥0, cannot be ≤ -13, so no solution. 0 not covered by this car.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nhead=-24, tail=-35, so τ=-35, h=-24.\n\nSpan(t) = [-35 + 12(t-8), -24 + 12(t-8)]\n\n0 in span if -35 +12(dt) ≤ 0 ≤ -24 +12(dt)\n\nFirst: -35 +12dt ≤0 => 12dt ≤35 => dt ≤ 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so dt ≤2\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -24 +12dt => 12dt ≥24 => dt ≥2\n\nSo dt=2, t=10.\n\nAt t=10, low= -35 +12*2= -35+24= -11, high= -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0 ], 0 included.\n\nOther times not.\n\nSo freeway 2, collision only at t=10.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"3 | (24,13,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) \" yes, identical to freeway 2.\n\nSo collision only at t=10.\n\nFreeway 4: (48,83,left,36)\n\nDirection left, head=48, tail=83.\n\nFor left-moving, Span(t) = [h - s(t-8), τ - s(t-8)] = [48 - 36(t-8), 83 - 36(t-8)]\n\n0 in span if 48 -36dt ≤ 0 ≤ 83 -36dt\n\nFirst: 48 -36dt ≤0 => -36dt ≤ -48 => 36dt ≥48 => dt ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so dt ≥ 2 since integer.\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 83 -36dt => 36dt ≤83 => dt ≤ 83/36 ≈2.305, so dt ≤2\n\nThus dt=2, t=10.\n\nAt t=10, low=48-72= -24, high=83-72=11, so [-24,11], 0 included.\n\ndt=2, t-8=2, t=10.\n\nAt dt=1, t=9: low=48-36=12, high=83-36=47, both positive, 0 not in.\n\nAt dt=2, t=10: low=48-72=-24, high=83-72=11, yes.\n\nAt dt=3, t=11: low=48-108=-60, high=83-108=-25, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo only t=10.\n\nBut freeway 5 is same as 4? \"5 | (48,83,left,36)\" yes, identical.\n\nSo freeway 5, collision only at t=10.\n\nNow freeway 6: (0,-11,right,6)\n\nhead=0, tail=-11, direction right.\n\nSo moving right, τ=tail=-11, h=head=0.\n\nSpan(t) = [τ + s(t-8), h + s(t-8)] = [-11 + 6(t-8), 0 + 6(t-8)] = [-11 + 6dt, 6dt]\n\nwhere dt=t-8.\n\n0 in span if -11 +6dt ≤ 0 ≤ 6dt\n\nFirst: -11 +6dt ≤0 => 6dt ≤11 => dt ≤ 11/6 ≈1.833, so dt≤1\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 6dt => dt ≥0\n\nSo dt=0 or dt=1.\n\ndt=0, t=8: span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\ndt=1, t=9: span [-11+6, 6] = [-5,6], 0 included.\n\ndt=2, t=10: [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo on freeway 6, collision at t=8 and t=9.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars: (-32,-43,right,4) and (32,21,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head=-32, tail=-43, right, s=4.\n\nτ=tail=-43, h=head=-32.\n\nSpan(t) = [-43 +4(t-8), -32 +4(t-8)]\n\n0 in span if -43 +4dt ≤ 0 ≤ -32 +4dt\n\nFirst: -43+4dt ≤0 => 4dt ≤43 => dt ≤ 43/4=10.75, so dt≤10\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -32 +4dt => 4dt ≥32 => dt≥8\n\nSo for dt from 8 to 10 inclusive.\n\nt=8+8=16 to 8+10=18.\n\ndt=8, t=16; dt=9,t=17; dt=10,t=18.\n\nAt dt=8: low= -43+32= -11, high= -32+32=0, [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\ndt=9: low= -43+36= -7, high= -32+36=4, [-7,4], 0 in.\n\ndt=10: low= -43+40= -3, high= -32+40=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nNow second car on freeway 7: (32,21,right,4)\n\nhead=32, tail=21, right, s=4.\n\nτ=tail=21, h=head=32.\n\nSpan(t) = [21 +4(t-8), 32 +4(t-8)]\n\n0 in span if 21+4dt ≤0 ≤32+4dt\n\nFirst: 21+4dt≤0 => 4dt≤-21, impossible since dt≥0.

So at t=8, y=3, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, y=6 has collision, but we are on y=3.\n\nNow, we want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nThe minimal H: since from y=3 to y=9, we need at least 6 moves up, but we can stay or move down, so H could be more.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so probably go up as fast as possible, but avoid the collision points.\n\nStart at t=8, y=3.\n\nWe can take actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf U, go to y=4 at t=9.\n\nIf S, stay at y=3 at t=9.\n\nIf D, go to y=2 at t=9.\n\nNow, at t=9, we need to be at some y where no collision at t=9.\n\nCollision at t=9:\n\ny=1: collision at t=9\n\ny=6: collision at t=9\n\ny=2,3,4,5,7,8: no collision at t=9? Let's see.\n\ny=1: t=9 collision\n\ny=2: collision only at t=10, not t=9\n\ny=3: t=10, not t=9\n\ny=4: t=10, not t=9\n\ny=5: t=10, not t=9\n\ny=6: t=9 collision\n\ny=7: no collision at t=9 (only 16-18)\n\ny=8: no at t=9 (16-19)\n\nSo at t=9, safe freeways: y=2,3,4,5,7,8\n\ny=1 and y=6 unsafe at t=9.\n\nNow at t=8, we are at y=3.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Action U: at t=9, y=4\n\ny=4 is safe at t=9, as above.\n\n- Action S: at t=9, y=3, also safe.\n\n- Action D: at t=9, y=2, safe.\n\nWe want to go up, so probably U or S, but S doesn't progress.\n\nAfter that, we need to reach y=9.\n\nBut at t=10, there is collision on multiple freeways.\n\nt=10 collision:\n\ny=2: collision\n\ny=3: collision\n\ny=4: collision\n\ny=5: collision\n\ny=1: no, only t=9\n\ny=6: collision only t=8,9, not t=10? y=6: at t=10, span was [1,12], 0 not in, so no collision.\n\ny=7: no at t=10\n\ny=8: no at t=10\n\nSo at t=10, unsafe: y=2,3,4,5\n\nSafe: y=1,6,7,8\n\ny=1: no car at x=0 at t=10, since only t=9.\n\nSimilarly y=6 safe at t=10.\n\ny=7 and y=8 safe.\n\nNow, we are at t=8, y=3.\n\nSuppose we go up to y=4 at t=9: so action a_8 = U, then at t=9, y=4.\n\nNow at t=9, we are at y=4, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=9, we need to choose action for t=10.\n\nAt t=10, if we are on y=4, it is unsafe, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay or go down, but y=4 at t=10 unsafe.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=9, we can:\n\n- Action U: go to y=5 at t=10, but y=5 unsafe at t=10.\n\n- Action S: stay y=4 at t=10, unsafe.\n\n- Action D: go to y=3 at t=10, but y=3 unsafe at t=10.\n\nAll options from y=4 lead to unsafe at t=10, because y=3,4,5 all unsafe at t=10.\n\ny=3,4,5 all have collision at t=10.\n\nSo if we are at y=4 at t=9, we cannot be on y=3,4, or 5 at t=10 without collision.\n\nBut we can move to other y.\n\nFor example, from y=4 at t=9, action U to y=5 at t=10, but y=5 unsafe.\n\nAction D to y=3 at t=10, unsafe.\n\nAction S to y=4, unsafe.\n\nBut we can only move to adjacent y or stay, so from y=4, we can only go to y=3,4,5, all unsafe at t=10.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be at y=4 at t=9, because we will be forced to collide at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at y=3 at t=9, same thing, to y=2,3,4 at t=10, but y=2 and y=4 unsafe? y=2 unsafe, y=3 unsafe, y=4 unsafe, y=2 is unsafe at t=10, yes.\n\nAt t=10, safe y: only y=1,6,7,8.\n\ny=1,6,7,8 are safe at t=10.\n\nNow, from y=3 at t=9, we can:\n\n- U to y=4 at t=10: but y=4 unsafe\n\n- S to y=3 at t=10: unsafe\n\n- D to y=2 at t=10: unsafe\n\nAll lead to unsafe, since y=2,3,4 all unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=9 we are at y=2, from t=8 action D.\n\nAt t=9, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=10, from y=2, can go to y=1,2,3.\n\ny=1 safe at t=10? y=1 collision only at t=9, not t=10, so safe.\n\ny=2 unsafe, y=3 unsafe.\n\nSo from y=2 at t=9, we can go to y=1 at t=10 with action D.\n\nAction D: from y=2 to y=1? Action D: down, so from y_t to y_{t+1} = y_t -1.\n\nAt t=9, y=2, if action D, go to y=1 at t=10.\n\ny=1 at t=10 is safe.\n\nIf action S, go to y=2 at t=10, unsafe.\n\nIf action U, go to y=3 at t=10, unsafe.\n\nSo only possible to go to y=1 with D.\n\nBut y=1 is not progress, we need to go up eventually.\n\nSimilarly, back to t=8.\n\nAt t=8, y=3, if we go down to y=2 at t=9 with action D.\n\nThen at t=9, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=10, as above, we can go down to y=1 with D.\n\nThen at t=10, y=1, safe.\n\nBut we are at y=1, which is low, and we need to go to y=9.\n\nThis might take more turns.\n\nWe can stay at t=8.\n\nAction S: at t=9, y=3, safe.\n\nBut then at t=9, y=3, we need to choose action for t=10.\n\nAs before, from y=3 at t=9, all moves to y=2,3,4 are unsafe at t=10.\n\nBut we can only move to adjacent, so no way to jump to y=6 or something.\n\nUnless we move at previous turns.\n\nAnother idea: at t=8, we can go up to y=4? But we saw that leads to problem.\n\nPerhaps go down to avoid.\n\nOr, we can move to a safe freeway at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, safe y: y=1,6,7,8.\n\nWe need to be at one of these at t=10.\n\nNow, at t=9, we need to be at a position from which we can reach these at t=10.\n\nFor example, to be at y=6 at t=10, we need to be at y=5,6, or 7 at t=9, then action to y=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at t=10, need y=6,7,8 at t=9.\n\ny=8 at t=10, need y=7,8,9 but y=9 not freeway, but we can be at y=8 or y=7 or y=9? y=9 is target, but we may not be there yet.\n\ny=9 is safe, but we need to reach it.\n\nAt t=9, we need to be at some y.\n\nAt t=9, safe y: y=2,3,4,5,7,8\n\nFrom these, we can move to positions that are safe at t=10.\n\nFor example, if at t=9 y=5, then at t=10 can go to y=4,5,6.\n\ny=4 and y=5 unsafe at t=10, y=6 safe.\n\nSo we can go to y=6 with action D? From y=5, action D to y=4? No.\n\nAction: U to y=6, S to y=5, D to y=4.\n\nSo from y=5 at t=9, action U to y=6 at t=10, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=9 y=4, action U to y=5 at t=10, but y=5 unsafe, or D to y=3 unsafe, S to y=4 unsafe, no good.\n\nIf at t=9 y=3, all bad.\n\nIf at t=9 y=2, can go to y=1 with D, which is safe at t=10.\n\ny=1 at t=10 safe.\n\nIf at t=9 y=7, then at t=10, can go to y=6,7,8.\n\ny=6 safe, y=7 safe, y=8 safe, all safe at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=9 y=8, can go to y=7,8,9.\n\ny=7,8 safe, y=9 safe.\n\nNow, at t=8, we are at y=3.\n\nWe can choose to go to y=4, y=3, or y=2 at t=9.\n\nIf we go to y=4 at t=9, as before, we cannot go to safe at t=10, since from y=4 we can only go to y=3,4,5, all unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if stay at y=3 at t=9, same, only to y=2,3,4 unsafe.\n\nIf go down to y=2 at t=9, then from y=2 at t=9, we can go down to y=1 at t=10, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=10, y=1.\n\nFrom there, we can start going up.\n\nBut y=1 to y=9, 8 steps, will take time.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are safe at t=10, and we can be there at t=10.\n\nHow to get to y=7 or y=8 by t=10.\n\nAt t=8, y=3.\n\nWe need to reach y=7 or 8 at t=10.\n\nFrom t=8 to t=10, two actions.\n\nPossible sequences:\n\nt=8: at y=3\n\nAfter action a8, at t=9 y = y3 + dy\n\nThen after a9, at t=10 y = y9 + dy\n\nWe need y10 =7 or 8.\n\ny10 depends on actions.\n\nFor example, if we do U at t=8, to y=4 at t=9.\n\nThen at t=9, from y=4, if we do U, to y=5 at t=10.\n\nBut y=5 not safe, and not 7 or 8.\n\nIf from y=4, U to y=5, or S to y=4, D to y=3, all not 7 or 8.\n\nCannot reach y=7 or 8 from y=4 in one step.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=9 y=3, can go to y=2,3,4.\n\nNot 7.\n\nIf at t=8 we go down to y=2 at t=9.\n\nThen at t=9 y=2, can go to y=1,2,3 at t=10, not 7.\n\nSo from y=3 at t=8, in two moves, the highest we can be is y=5: U at t8 to y4, U at t9 to y5.\n\nOr if we go up and down, but y=5 is max.\n\nWe cannot reach y=7 or y=8 from y=3 in two moves, since each move changes by at most 1.\n\nSo at t=10, we can be at most y=5 or min y=1.\n\nBut y=6 is safe at t=10, and we can reach y=6.\n\nHow? From t=8 y=3.\n\nIf we go up to y=4 at t=9, then from y=4 at t=9, we can go up to y=5, but y=5 unsafe at t=10, or down to y=3 unsafe, but we can go to y=6? From y=4, we can only go to y=3,4,5, not directly to y=6.\n\nActions only U, D, S, so change by 1 or stay.\n\nSo from y=4, cannot go to y=6 in one step.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=6 at t=10, we need to be at y=5,6, or 7 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, we can be at y=5, for example.\n\nHow to be at y=5 at t=9.\n\nFrom t=8 y=3, we need two U to go to y=5 at t=10, but at t=9 we are at y=4.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=8, U to y=4 at t=9, then U to y=5 at t=10.\n\nBut at t=10, y=5 is unsafe.\n\nIf we could be at y=6 at t=9, but from y=3 at t=8, impossible in one move.\n\nSo the only way to be safe at t=10 is to be at y=1,6,7,8.\n\nWe can reach y=1 or y=6 at t=10 with sequences.\n\nFirst, to reach y=6 at t=10.\n\nWe need to be at y=5,6, or7 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, safe y are y=2,3,4,5,7,8.\n\ny=5 is safe at t=9.\n\nSo if we can be at y=5 at t=9.\n\nFrom t=8 y=3, to be at y=5 at t=9, we need to go up twice in one turn? No, one action per turn.\n\nAt t=8, action a8, to y at t=9.\n\nFrom y=3, if U, to y=4 at t=9; if S, y=3; if D, y=2. Cannot reach y=5 at t=9 from y=3 at t=8 in one action.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=5 at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at t=9: from y=3, impossible.\n\ny=7 at t=9: impossible.\n\ny=8 at t=9: impossible.\n\nSo at t=9, the highest we can be is y=4 (if U from y=3), or y=3, or y=2.\n\nNone of which allow us to be at y=6,7,8 at t=10 directly.\n\nFor example, from y=4 at t=9, we can go to y=5 at t=10, but not y=6.\n\ny=5 to y=6 is possible, but at t=10 y=5 unsafe.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=9, to y=4 at t=10, not good.\n\nBut we can be at y=6 at t=10 if at t=9 we are at y=5 or y=6 or y=7.\n\nBut we cannot be at y=5,6,7 at t=9 from start.\n\nSimilarly, the only possibilities to be at safe y at t=10 are:\n\n- Be at y=1 at t=10, by going down to y=2 at t=9 then down to y=1 at t=10.\n\n- Or be at y=6 at t=10, but to be at y=6 at t=10, we need to be at y=5,6,7 at t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, we can be at y=4 (from U), y=3 (S), y=2 (D), none of which is y=5,6,7.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=6 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 or 8 at t=10: need to be at y=6,7,8 at t=9 or y=7,8,9, but y=9 not at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, we are at y=4 max, so cannot be at y=6,7,8.\n\nTherefore, the only way to be safe at t=10 is to be at y=1 at t=10.\n\nBy going down: at t=8, action D to y=2 at t=9.\n\nThen at t=9, action D to y=1 at t=10.\n\nThen at t=10, y=1, safe.\n\nFrom there, we can go up.\n\nBut y=1 to y=9, 8 steps, and we have to avoid future collisions.\n\nSince t=10 is the only critical time near now, after that, we can go up freely, but there are later collisions on y=7 and 8 at t=16-19, but we can be at y=9 before that.\n\nFirst, let's see the path.\n\nStart: t=8, y=3\n\nAction a8 = D, to y=2 at t=9\n\nAt t=9, y=2, safe (since y=2 safe at t=9)\n\nAction a9 = D, to y=1 at t=10\n\nAt t=10, y=1, safe (y=1 safe at t=10)\n\nNow, from y=1 at t=10, we can start going up.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nEach U move increases y by 1, so from y=1 to y=9, 8 U moves, but we can do it in 8 turns if no obstacles.\n\nBut are there other collision times?\n\nFor example, on y=1: only collision at t=9, which is past, so no problem.\n\ny=2: collision at t=10, which is now, but at t=10 we are at y=1, not y=2.\n\nAt t=11, y=2 might be safe? Let's check.\n\nFor y=2, collision only at t=10, as per earlier.\n\nAt t=10, collision, but at other times?\n\nFrom car: on y=2, cars: at t=10 only, as calculated.\n\nSimilarly y=3: only t=10\n\ny=4: only t=10\n\ny=5: only t=10\n\ny=6: collision at t=8 and t=9, but t=10 and later, no, since at t=10 span [1,12], 0 not in, and moving right, so later 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and y=8 have collisions later at t=16-19, but we can be at y=9 before t=16.\n\nt=10 to t=16 is 6 turns, and we need to go from y=1 to y=9, 8 steps, so 8 turns, t=10 to t=17, which is after t=16.\n\nLet's see.\n\nAt t=10, y=1\n\nIf we go up each turn, actions U.\n\nt=10: y=1, action U, to y=2 at t=11\n\nt=11: y=2, action U, to y=3 at t=12\n\nt=12: y=3, U to y=4 at t=13\n\nt=13: y=4, U to y=5 at t=14\n\nt=14: y=5, U to y=6 at t=15\n\nt=15: y=6, U to y=7 at t=16\n\nt=16: y=7, action U to y=8 at t=17? Or need to check collision.\n\nAt t=16, y=7.\n\nNow, y=7 has collision at t=16,17,18.\n\nAt t=16, if we are on y=7, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt t=15, y=6, action U to y=7 at t=16.\n\nBut at t=16, y=7 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay or go down, but we need to go up.\n\nAt t=16, y=7 unsafe, so we cannot be on y=7 at t=16.\n\nSimilarly, we need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 during t=16 to 19.\n\nSince we are going up, we might need to pause or something.\n\nFirst, from t=10, y=1, we can go up to y=6 without problem, since no collisions on y=1 to 6 except past times.\n\ny=1: no collision after t=9\n\ny=2: no after t=10\n\ny=3: no after t=10\n\ny=4: no after t=10\n\ny=5: no after t=10\n\ny=6: no collision after t=9, at t=10 and later safe.\n\nSo from t=10 to t=15:\n\nt=10: y=1, action U to y=2 at t=11\n\nt=11: y=2, action U to y=3 at t=12\n\nt=12: y=3, U to y=4 at t=13\n\nt=13: y=4, U to y=5 at t=14\n\nt=14: y=5, U to y=6 at t=15\n\nt=15: y=6, now at t=15, we are on y=6, safe.\n\nNow, from here, we need to go to y=7 or higher.\n\nBut at t=16, if we go to y=7, collision.\n\nAction S: stay y=6 at t=16, y=6 is safe at t=16? y=6 no collision, yes.\n\nThen at t=16, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=17, we can go to y=7, but t=17 y=7 collision.\n\ny=7 collision at t=16,17,18.\n\nSimilarly, if go to y=7 at t=17, collision.\n\nWe can stay at y=6 for multiple turns until after t=18.\n\nt=15: y=6\n\nAction S at t=15: to y=6 at t=16, safe.\n\nAt t=16: y=6, action S to y=6 at t=17, safe.\n\nAt t=17: y=6, action S to y=6 at t=18, safe.\n\nAt t=18: y=6, now at t=18, y=7 is still unsafe? t=18, y=7 collision at t=16,17,18, so t=18 unsafe.\n\ny=7 collision until t=18.\n\nt=19: for y=7, collision only up to t=18? Earlier: y=7 collision at t=16,17,18.\n\nAt t=19: for y=7, first car: at t=19, dt=19-8=11, low= -43 +4*11= -43+44=1, high= -32+44=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car no, so y=7 safe at t=19.\n\nSimilarly, y=8: collision at t=16,17,18,19? t=19: dt=11, for y=8 car: span [-35+3*11, -24+3*11] = [-35+33, -24+33] = [-2,9], 0 in, so collision at t=19.\n\ny=8 collision at t=16 to 19 inclusive.\n\nt=19 unsafe for y=8.\n\nt=20: dt=12, low= -35+36=1, high= -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo for y=7: unsafe t=16,17,18; safe t=19 and later\n\ny=8: unsafe t=16,17,18,19; safe t=20 and later.\n\nNow back to our path.\n\nAt t=15, y=6.\n\nWe can stay at y=6 until it is safe to move up.\n\nIf we go to y=7 at t=19, for example.\n\nt=19 y=7 safe.\n\nBut from t=15 to t=19, we are at y=6 for multiple turns.\n\nt=15: y=6\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=6, to y=9, need 3 U moves.\n\nBut we need to avoid y=7 and y=8 during unsafe times.\n\nUnsafe times for y=7: t=16,17,18\n\nFor y=8: t=16,17,18,19\n\nSo to go from y=6 to y=7, we can do at t=19.\n\nSimilarly, to y=8 at t=20, etc.\n\nBut let's see the turns.\n\nAt t=15, y=6.\n\nWe can:\n\n- Stay at y=6 for turns: t=15,16,17,18\n\nThen at t=18, we can go to y=7 at t=19? Actions:\n\nAt t=15: we are at y=6, choose action for next position.\n\nAction at turn t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + dy.\n\nCollision at turn t based on y_t.\n\nIn this case, at t=15, y=6, no collision.\n\nWe choose action.\n\nIf we do S, stay at y=6 for t=16.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo be safe, we should stay at y=6 until we can move up safely.\n\nFirst time we can be on y=7 safely is t=19.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, t=20.\n\nSo:\n\nAt t=15: y=6, action S, to y=6 at t=16\n\nt=16: y=6, action S, to y=6 at t=17\n\nt=17: y=6, action S, to y=6 at t=18\n\nt=18: y=6, action U, to y=7 at t=19\n\nNow at t=19, y=7, which is safe (since t=19, y=7 safe)\n\nThen at t=19, action U to y=8 at t=20\n\nAt t=20, y=8, now y=8 safe at t=20? t=20, dt=12, span [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at t=20, action U to y=9 at t=21\n\nThen at t=21, y=9, reached.\n\nBut we started from t=10 y=1.\n\nt=10 to t=21 is 11 turns, but we need to include from beginning.\n\nLet's list all turns from t=8.\n\nFirst part: t=8: y=3, action D to y=2 at t=9\n\nt=9: y=2, action D to y=1 at t=10\n\nt=10: y=1, action U to y=2 at t=11\n\nt=11: y=2, U to y=3 at t=12\n\nt=12: y=3, U to y=4 at t=13\n\nt=13: y=4, U to y=5 at t=14\n\nt=14: y=5, U to y=6 at t=15\n\nt=15: y=6, S to y=6 at t=16\n\nt=16: y=6, S to y=6 at t=17\n\nt=17: y=6, S to y=6 at t=18\n\nt=18: y=6, U to y=7 at t=19\n\nt=19: y=7, U to y=8 at t=20\n\nt=20: y=8, U to y=9 at t=21\n\nReached at t=21.\n\nTotal turns from start: from t=8 to t=21, that's 14 turns, but H is the number of actions? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence: actions from t=8 to t=20, for 13 actions, to reach at t=21.\n\nt=8 to t=20 inclusive, 13 actions, y_{21} =9.\n\nMinimal? Probably not, we can optimize.\n\nSince we had to go down and wait, it took many turns.\n\nBut earlier, we could not avoid t=10 collision without going down.\n\nAnother idea: at t=8, instead of going down, we go up to y=4 at t=9, but then at t=9 y=4, we cannot do anything for t=10, but we can move to a different y.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=9, we can only go to y=3,4,5, all unsafe at t=10.\n\nUnless we can be at y=6 at t=10, but we can't from there.\n\nPerhaps at t=8, we go directly to a position that allows us to be at safe y at t=10.\n\nBut we can't.\n\nAnother thought: the collision at t=10 is only on y=2,3,4,5, so if we can be on y=1,6,7,8 at t=10.\n\nWe can reach y=1 as before, or y=6 if possible.\n\nTo reach y=6 at t=10, we need to be at y=5,6,7 at t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, we can be at y=4 max from start, so no.\n\nUnless we start from lower, but we start at y=3.\n\nPerhaps we can go down to y=0 or something, but y=0 is safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is available.\n\nI forgot y=0.\n\ny=0 is a position, no freeway, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can go to y=0.\n\nAt t=8, y=3.\n\nWe can go down to y=2 at t=9, or even to y=1 or y=0? From y=3, action D to y=2, not directly to y=0.\n\nBut we can go to y=0 over multiple turns.\n\nFor example, at t=8, action D to y=2 at t=9\n\nThen at t=9, action D to y=1 at t=10\n\nOr at t=9, action D to y=1, then at t=10 to y=0.\n\nBut let's see for t=10.\n\nAt t=10, y=0 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6,7,8 safe.\n\nNow, to be at y=6 at t=10, need at t=9 to be at y=5,6,7.\n\nBut at t=9, we can be at y=4,3,2 from start.\n\nNot y=5.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=6,7,8 at t=10.\n\ny=1 at t=10: possible, by going down.\n\ny=0 at t=10: possible, by going down twice.\n\nFrom t=8 y=3, action D to y=2 at t=9\n\nThen action D to y=1 at t=10\n\nOr at t=9 action D to y=1, then at t=10 action D to y=0.\n\nBut y=1 at t=10 is safe, as before.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut to save time, perhaps go to y=0.\n\nBut y=0 to y=9, 9 steps, same as y=1 to y=9 but one more down.\n\nNot better.\n\nAt t=10, if at y=0, we can go up.\n\nBut let's see if we can avoid the waiting later.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=10, y=6 is safe, and we can be at y=6 at some point.\n\nBut from start, we need to reach y=6.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=8, to y=6.\n\nWith actions: to go from y=3 to y=6, need 3 U moves, but with turns.\n\nFor example, t=8: U to y=4 at t=9\n\nt=9: U to y=5 at t=10\n\nBut at t=10 y=5 unsafe.\n\nt=8: U to y=4 at t=9\n\nt=9: S to y=4 at t=10? But y=4 unsafe at t=10.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps go down first then up, but that takes more turns.\n\nFor example, t=8: D to y=2 at t=9\n\nt=9: U to y=3 at t=10? y=3 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nt=8: S to y=3 at t=9\n\nt=9: U to y=4 at t=10, unsafe.\n\nNo way to be at safe y at t=10 except y=1 or y=0 or possibly y=6 but can't reach.\n\ny=6 at t=10 is safe, but we can't be there because we can't reach from t=8 in two moves with the constraints.\n\nSo the only option is to be at y=1 at t=10 or lower.\n\nThen from there go up, and deal with later collisions.\n\nBut in the later part, we can reduce the waiting.\n\nFor example, from t=10 y=1, go up to y=6 by t=15, as before.\n\nt=10: y=1, U to y=2 at t=11\n\nt=11: y=2, U to y=3 at t=12\n\nt=12: y=3, U to y=4 at t=13\n\nt=13: y=4, U to y=5 at t=14\n\nt=14: y=5, U to y=6 at t=15\n\nNow at t=15, y=6.\n\nInstead of staying until t=18, we can go to y=7 at t=19.\n\nBut from t=15 to t=19, we need to be safe.\n\nAt t=15, y=6, safe.\n\nWe can go to y=7 at t=19 directly? No, actions per turn.\n\nAt t=15, we can choose to stay or move.\n\nIf we go to y=7 at t=16, collision.\n\nSo we must stay at y=6 or go down, but down is not good.\n\nSo stay at y=6 for some turns.\n\nFirst safe time for y=7 is t=19.\n\nt=19 y=7 safe.\n\nTo go to y=7 at t=19, we need to be at y=6 or y=7 or y=8 at t=18.\n\nAt t=18, y=7 and y=8 are unsafe, but y=6 is safe.\n\nSo we can be at y=6 at t=18, then action U to y=7 at t=19.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8 at t=20.\n\nSo we need to be at y=6 at t=18.\n\nFrom t=15 y=6, we can stay at y=6 for t=16, t=17, t=18.\n\nActions:\n\nt=15: y=6, action S to y=6 at t=16\n\nt=16: y=6, action S to y=6 at t=17\n\nt=17: y=6, action S to y=6 at t=18\n\nt=18: y=6, action U to y=7 at t=19\n\nt=19: y=7, action U to y=8 at t=20\n\nt=20: y=8, action U to y=9 at t=21\n\nSame as before.\n\nCan we go to y=7 earlier? No, because unsafe until t=19.\n\nt=19 is the first safe for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, we could go to y=8 at t=20, but we need to be there.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, perhaps go to y=7 at t=19, then to y=8 at t=20, then to y=9 at t=21.\n\nIf we can reach y=8 earlier, but y=8 first safe at t=20.\n\nt=20 y=8 safe.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=20, need to be at y=7,8,9 at t=19.\n\nAt t=19, y=7 is safe, y=8 is unsafe (t=19 collision), y=9 safe.\n\nSo we can be at y=7 at t=19, then U to y=8 at t=20.\n\nOr at y=9.\n\nBut y=7 at t=19.\n\nSo same as above.\n\nNo better.\n\nBut in the beginning, we went down to y=1, but perhaps we can go to y=7 or 8 earlier.\n\nFor example, from start, if we go up as much as possible.\n\nt=8: U to y=4 at t=9\n\nBut then at t=9 y=4, and at t=10 we have problem.\n\nUnless we can skip t=10 by being on safe y.\n\nBut we can't.\n\nPerhaps at t=8, we go down to y=0 or something.\n\nLet's try to go to y=8 quickly.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=8, to y=8, need 5 U moves.\n\nBut with t=10 collision in the way.\n\nFor example, t=8: U to y=4 at t=9\n\nt=9: U to y=5 at t=10 — but y=5 unsafe at t=10, collision.\n\nt=8: U to y=4 at t=9\n\nt=9: D to y=3 at t=10 — y=3 unsafe.\n\nt=8: S to y=3 at t=9\n\nt=9: U to y=4 at t=10 — unsafe.\n\nt=8: D to y=2 at t=9\n\nt=9: U to y=3 at t=10 — unsafe.\n\nAll lead to collision or no progress.\n\nSo the only way to avoid t=10 collision is to be on y=1,0,6,7,8 at t=10, and since we can only be on y=1 or 0, we must go down.\n\nSo the path I have is probably minimal in terms of avoiding collisions.\n\nBut let's confirm the number of turns.\n\nFrom t=8 to t=21, that's 14 turns, but the player position at t=21 is y=9.\n\nThe number of actions H: actions from t=8 to t=20, 13 actions.\n\nt from t=8 to t=20 inclusive, that's 13 actions, reaching at t=21.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, I think the sequence has H actions for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and position at t_1 + H.\n\nIn the problem: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nSo the sequence has H actions, for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, t_1 =8, so actions for t=8 to t=8+H-1, position at t=8+H.\n\nIn my path, position at t=21 is y=9, so 8+H=21, H=13.\n\nActions from t=8 to t=20.\n\nBut perhaps we can do better by not going all the way to y=1.\n\nFor example, at t=8, go down to y=2 at t=9\n\nThen at t=9, instead of going down, we can stay or something.\n\nAt t=9, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=10, we must not be on y=2,3,4,5, so we can go to y=1 or y=6, but from y=2, we can go to y=1,2,3.\n\ny=1 safe, y=2 and 3 unsafe.\n\nSo only y=1.\n\nNo choice.\n\nGo to y=1 at t=10.\n\nThen from there up.\n\nBut to save time, from y=1, we can go up faster, but we have to wait at y=6 for the later collision.\n\nBut the waiting is necessary because of y=7 and y=8 unsafe times.\n\nUnless we can be at y=9 before t=16.\n\nFrom t=10 y=1, to y=9, need 8 U moves, so at least 8 turns, t=10 to t=18 for y=9 at t=18.\n\nt=10: y=1\n\nAfter k U moves, at turn t=10+k, y=1+k\n\nSet y=9, so 1+k=9, k=8, at t=18.\n\nBut at t=18, if we are at y=9, it is safe, no issue.\n\nBut can we reach y=9 at t=18?\n\nFrom t=10 y=1, with 8 U actions, we reach y=9 at t=18.\n\nBut we need to go through y=7 and y=8.\n\nAt t=16, where are we?\n\nt=10: y=1\n\nt=11: y=2\n\nt=12: y=3\n\nt=13: y=4\n\nt=14: y=5\n\nt=15: y=6\n\nt=16: y=7\n\nBut at t=16, y=7 has collision! Oh.\n\nSimilarly, t=17: y=8, collision if on y=8.\n\nt=17: if y=8, collision.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=10: y=1, U to y=2 at t=11\n\nt=11: y=2, U to y=3 at t=12\n\nt=12: y=3, U to y=4 at t=13\n\nt=13: y=4, U to y=5 at t=14\n\nt=14: y=5, U to y=6 at t=15\n\nt=15: y=6, U to y=7 at t=16 — but at t=16, y=7 collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf at t=15, we do not go to y=7, but stay, then at t=16 y=6 safe, but then we are behind.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=18, we need to be at y=7 at t=17, but at t=17 y=7 collision.\n\nt=17: y=7 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go faster, but from y=1 at t=10, the earliest to y=9 is t=18, but we must be on y=7 at t=17 or y=8 at t=18, both unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically, to reach y=9 at t=18, we are at y=8 at t=17? Let's see the turns.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nTo have y_t=9 at some t.\n\nFrom y_10=1, after actions.\n\nAction at t=10: U, y11=2\n\nt=11: U, y12=3\n\nt=12: U, y13=4\n\nt=13: U, y14=5\n\nt=14: U, y15=6\n\nt=15: U, y16=7\n\nt=16: U, y17=8\n\nt=17: U, y18=9\n\nNow, at t=16, y=7, collision.\n\nAt t=17, y=8, collision (since y=8 unsafe t=17).\n\ny=8 unsafe t=16,17,18,19.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nIf we stay at some point, we arrive later.\n\nSo we must delay so that when we go to y=7, it is at t=19 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSo the waiting is necessary.\n\nIn the path I have, we reach at t=21.\n\nBut let's see if we can start going up earlier from the down position.\n\nFor example, from t=10 y=1, go up, but at t=15 y=6, we stay until t=18, then go up.\n\nBut at t=18, we go to y=7 at t=19.\n\nCan we go to y=7 at t=19 directly from y=6 at t=18.\n\nBut we need to be at y=6 at t=18.\n\nFrom t=15 y=6, we stay three turns: t=15 S to y6 t=16, t=16 S to y6 t=17, t=17 S to y6 t=18, then t=18 U to y7 t=19.\n\nThen t=19 U to y8 t=20, t=20 U to y9 t=21.\n\nSame as before.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=8 faster after.\n\nBut no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=9 is safe, we can go directly to y=9 from y=8 at safe time.\n\nBut y=8 first safe at t=20.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=20, from below.\n\nBut we have to come from y=7.\n\ny=7 first safe at t=19.\n\nSo we can be at y=7 at t=19, y=8 at t=20, y=9 at t=21.\n\nIf we can be at y=7 at t=19.\n\nNow, to reach y=7 at t=19, from start.\n\nFrom t=8 y=3.\n\nWe need to reach y=7 at t=19.\n\nNumber of moves: from y=3 to y=7, need 4 U moves, but we have many turns, we can have S or D.\n\nBut we have to avoid t=10 collision.\n\nIn the path, we went down to y=1 at t=10, then up to y=6 at t=15, then wait, then to y=7 at t=19.\n\nFrom y=1 to y=7, need 6 U moves, from t=10 to t=16 for y=7 at t=16, but t=16 y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo we must wait.\n\nThe waiting is at y=6.\n\nTo minimize H, we should minimize the waiting or the down moves.\n\nBut we had to go down to avoid t=10.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=6 earlier and stay.\n\nFor example, at t=8 y=3.\n\nIf we could go to y=6 quickly.\n\nBut to go to y=6 from y=3, need 3 U moves.\n\nt=8: U to y4 t=9\n\nt=9: U to y5 t=10 — but y5 unsafe at t=10.\n\nCollision.\n\nt=8: U to y4 t=9\n\nt=9: S to y4 t=10 — y4 unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nt=8: D to y2 t=9\n\nt=9: U to y3 t=10 — y3 unsafe.\n\nStill.\n\nSo no way to be at y=6 at t=10 or before without collision.\n\nTherefore, the only option is to be below at t=10, like y=1, then go up and wait at y=6.\n\nSo H=13 is probably minimal.\n\nBut let's list the actions to confirm.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=8, position (0,3)\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 8: D  (to y=2 at t=9)\n\nTurn 9: D  (to y=1 at t=10)\n\nTurn 10: U  (to y=2 at t=11)\n\nTurn 11: U  (to y=3 at t=12)\n\nTurn 12: U  (to y=4 at t=13)\n\nTurn 13: U  (to y=5 at t=14)\n\nTurn 14: U  (to y=6 at t=15)\n\nTurn 15: S  (stay y=6 at t=16)\n\nTurn 16: S  (stay y=6 at t=17)\n\nTurn 17: S  (stay y=6 at t=18)\n\nTurn 18: U  (to y=7 at t=19)\n\nTurn 19: U  (to y=8 at t=20)\n\nTurn 20: U  (to y=9 at t=21)\n\nPosition at t=21 is (0,9), so we reached at turn t=21.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 8 to turn 20, 13 actions, so H=13.\n\nSequence: D, D, U, U, U, U, U, S, S, S, U, U, U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nSuppose at t=8, we go down to y=0.\n\nt=8: D to y=2 at t=9\n\nt=9: D to y=1 at t=10\n\nThen t=10: D to y=0 at t=11\n\nThen from y=0 at t=11, go up.\n\nt=11: U to y=1 at t=12\n\n...\n\nBut this takes one more turn to go down, so reach later.\n\nWorse.\n\nAt t=9, from y=2, we go to y=1 at t=10, same as before.\n\nNo better.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to go all the way to y=1, but to y=0 or something, but not helpful.\n\nSo I think H=13 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's check if we can avoid going down by waiting at y=3.\n\nFor example, at t=8, S to y=3 at t=9\n\nAt t=9, y=3 safe.\n\nThen at t=10, we must move, but y=2,3,4 all unsafe, so if we go to y=2,3,4, collision.\n\nBut we can only go to those.\n\nUnless we go to y=1 or y=5, but from y=3, action D to y=2, U to y=4, S to y=3, no y=1 or y=5 directly.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, the path is correct.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nt_1=8.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 20 action U to y=9 at t=21.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the minimal H is 13.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from turn 8 to turn 20, 13 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can reduce the waiting at y=6.\n\nFor example, if we go to y=7 at t=19, but we can only do that from y=6 at t=18.\n\nAnd to be at y=6 at t=18, we need to arrive earlier or stay.\n\nIn the path, we arrive at y=6 at t=15, so we stay for three turns: t=15,16,17 actions S, to be at y=6 for t=16,17,18, then move at t=18.\n\nBut if we can arrive at y=6 later, we might save some S actions.\n\nFor example, from the beginning, we go down to y=1 at t=10, but then instead of going up immediately, we can stay at y=1 for some turns, but that would delay further, worse.\n\nFrom t=10 y=1, we go up, arrive at y=6 at t=15.\n\nIf we could arrive at y=6 at, say, t=17, then we can go directly to y=7 at t=19? But to arrive at y=6 at t=17, from y=1 at t=10, that would take 6 moves, but from t=10 to t=17 is 7 turns, so we can have one S somewhere.\n\nFor example, at t=10 y=1, S to y=1 at t=11, then start up.\n\nBut then at t=11 y=1, U to y=2 t=12, ..., up to t=16: y=6? Let's see:\n\nt=10: y=1, S to y=1 at t=11  (if we stay)\n\nt=11: y=1, U to y=2 at t=12\n\nt=12: y=2, U to y=3 at t=13\n\nt=13: y=3, U to y=4 at t=14\n\nt=14: y=4, U to y=5 at t=15\n\nt=15: y=5, U to y=6 at t=16\n\nThen at t=16 y=6.\n\nThen we need to stay: t=16 S to y=6 t=17\n\nt=17 S to y=6 t=18\n\nt=18 U to y=7 t=19\n\nSame as before, but we added one S at t=10, so we reach later, worse.\n\nWithout staying, arrive at y=6 at t=15, then stay until t=18.\n\nThe waiting is fixed because we need to be at y=6 until t=18 to move at t=18.\n\nSince we arrive at t=15, we must wait three turns.\n\nIf we arrive later, we wait less, but we start later, so net same or worse.\n\nFor example, if we start going up later, we arrive at y=6 later, but then we might wait less, but the reaching time to y=9 is the same or later.\n\nSuppose from t=10 y=1, we stay at y=1 for k turns, then go up.\n\nBut going up takes 8 turns to y=9, but with waiting at y=6.\n\nIf we stay at y=1 for k turns, then at t=10+k, y=1, then go to y=6 in 5 turns, at t=10+k+5, y=6.\n\nThen need to stay at y=6 until t=18, so if t=10+k+5 <=18, then stay until t=18.\n\nThen go to y=9 in 3 turns, at t=21.\n\nFor example, k=0: arrive y=6 at t=15, stay until t=18 (3 S), then to y=9 at t=21.\n\nk=1: at t=10 S, y=1 at t=11\n\nThen t=11 U to y=2 t=12, ..., t=15 U to y=6 t=16\n\nArrive y=6 at t=16.\n\nThen need to stay until t=18: at t=16, S to y=6 t=17; t=17 S to y=6 t=18; then t=18 U to y=7 t=19, etc., same as before.\n\nBut arrive at y=6 later, so we save one S action but the reach time same.\n\nIn terms of H, the actions are from t=8 to t=20, H=13.\n\nIf we start up later, H might be larger.\n\nFor example, with k=1, actions:\n\nt=8: D\n\nt=9: D\n\nt=10: S  (stay at y=1, but at t=10 we are at y=1, action S to stay y=1 at t=11)\n\nt=11: U\n\n...\n\nUp to t=15: U to y=6 at t=16? From t=11: U to y=2 t=12\n\nt=12: U to y=3 t=13\n\nt=13: U to y=4 t=14\n\nt=14: U to y=5 t=15\n\nt=15: U to y=6 t=16\n\nThen t=16: S to y=6 t=17\n\nt=17: S to y=6 t=18\n\nt=18: U to y=7 t=19\n\nt=19: U to y=8 t=20\n\nt=20: U to y=9 t=21\n\nNow actions from t=8 to t=20, still 13 actions, same H.\n\nBut we have an extra S at t=10, but we reached same time.\n\nIn the first path, we had U from t=10 to t=14, now we have S at t=10 and U from t=11 to t=15, but t=15 action U to y=6 at t=16.\n\nThen S at t=16 and t=17.\n\nNumber of actions same, H same.\n\nBut in the sequence, it has one more S and one less U, but same length.\n\nNo improvement.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 13.\n\nSo the action sequence is as above.\n\nNow to write in the box.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 8: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the sequence, turn 20 action U to y=9 at t=21.\n\nYes.\n\nI think this is correct.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H = 13\\) is achieved with the following sequence of actions.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 10, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1) or stay (S: y remains). The y-coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn, and the x-coordinate 0 is inside the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the exact moment of turn T, the player is still on y_T. So at turn T, we only check the freeway y_T (if y_T is between 1 and 8). We do not check the freeway we are moving to (y_{T+1}) until we are on it at the next turn.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1=10. For each freeway k (from 1 to 8), we have a list of cars. Each car is described by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note that for left-moving cars, the head is the leftmost? Actually, the update rule clarifies:\n\nFor a left-moving car: at turn t1, the car span is [h, τ] (which implies h is the right end and τ the left end? because as it moves left, both h and τ decrease). Similarly, right-moving: [τ, h] meaning τ is the left and h the right? Actually, the update rule:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  So if at t1 the car is [h, τ] and h>τ (since it moves left, decreasing), then at time T, the entire segment shifts left by s*(T-t1).\n\nBut note the example: for left-moving, the head is at a higher x? Actually, the description says: \"head\" and \"tail\". In the update for left-moving, the head is h and tail is τ, and then the new head is h - s*(T-t1) and new tail is τ - s*(T-t1). So if the car is moving left, then the head must be the rightmost point? Because when it moves left, the entire segment moves left. Similarly, for right-moving: head is h and tail is τ, but then the update is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]? Actually, the update rule for right-moving is written as:\n  Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the table, for right-moving cars, the representation is (head, tail, direction, speed). So let's clarify:\n\nIn the update for right-moving: the initial span at t1 is [τ, h]? But the table gives (head, tail) = (48,37) for a right-moving car? That would be head=48, tail=37. Then the initial span is [37,48]? Because for right-moving, the update rule says: initial span is [τ, h] and then becomes [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt]. So if head=48 and tail=37, then the car at t1 is from 37 to 48? Then as time passes, it moves right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: the initial span is [h, τ] and then becomes [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt]. If we have a car (48,83,left,36) then that would be h=48, τ=83? But then at t1, the car is from 48 to 83? That doesn't make sense because 48<83, but then moving left would make the entire segment shift left. However, typically we expect the head to be the leading part. \n\nBut note: the update rule for left-moving: \n  Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\nIf at t1, the car is [h, τ] and h < τ, then when we subtract, the entire segment moves left without changing order? Actually, if h and τ are given in the order of the direction? \n\nAlternatively, the representation might be that for a left-moving car, the head is the leftmost point? But the update rule subtracts from both, so if the car is moving left, then the head (which is the front) should be the leftmost? Then the tail is the rightmost? Then the initial span would be [head, tail] but then head < tail? Then when moving left, both decrease, so the head becomes even smaller.\n\nBut in the given data for freeway 4 and 5: (48,83,left,36). If head=48 and tail=83, then the car is from 48 to 83? Then moving left: at time T, it becomes [48 - 36*(T-10), 83 - 36*(T-10)]. Then at T=10, it is [48,83]. But that is a car of length 35 (from 48 to 83) and moving left? Then the head (leading part) is at 48? Then as it moves left, the head goes to 48 - 36*(dt) and the tail to 83 - 36*(dt). So the entire segment moves left.\n\nSimilarly, for a right-moving car: (48,37,right,12). Then the initial span at t1=10 is [37,48]? Because the update rule for right-moving: [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt] and initially at t1: [τ, h] = [37,48]. Then at T, [37+12*(T-10), 48+12*(T-10)].\n\nBut wait: the update rule for right-moving says: initial span at t1 is [τ, h]? Then at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So if τ=37 and h=48, then the car at t1 is from 37 to 48. Then moving right, it becomes [37+12*dt, 48+12*dt].\n\nNow, collision: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (y_T = k) and the player's x=0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe are at turn 10, and we are at (0,0). We want to go to (0,9). We can only change y by at most 1 per turn, so we need at least 9 moves (if we always go up). But we have to avoid cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe must plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves from y=0 to y=9 without colliding with any car on the freeway we are on at each turn.\n\nNote: at the starting turn (t1=10) we are on freeway 0 (if we consider y=0 as not having any freeway? The freeways are from y=1 to y=8). So at turn 10, we are at y=0: no car collision. Then we move. At turn 11, we will be at y1 (if we moved up then y1=1, if we stay then y1=0, if we move down we cannot because y=0 is the minimum). Since we are at y=0, we cannot move down, so we can only do U or S.\n\nBut our goal is to get to y=9. So we must eventually move up.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway and for each future turn (starting from turn 10) the positions of the cars and check if the player would collide.\n\nWe are going to simulate the moves. We are at turn 10: y=0 (safe). We need to decide actions for turns 10, 11, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe want the minimal H. So we try to go as fast as possible (always up) and see if we can avoid collisions.\n\nBut let's compute the car positions at different turns.\n\nFirst, note: for a given freeway k, we have a list of cars. We need to check for each turn T, if the player is on that freeway at turn T (i.e., y_T = k), then we check if 0 is in any of the car spans at turn T.\n\nWe'll define a function that for a freeway k and a turn T (relative to t1=10, so T=10,11,...) returns whether there is a car covering x=0.\n\nBut note: the cars are defined at t1=10. For a car on freeway k:\n\nFor a right-moving car: (τ, h, d='right', s) at t1=10: so at turn T, the car is [τ + s*(T-10), h + s*(T-10)].\n\nFor a left-moving car: (h, τ, d='left', s) at t1=10: so at turn T, the car is [h - s*(T-10), τ - s*(T-10)].\n\nThen we check if 0 is in the interval [min, max] of that car.\n\nBut note: the representation in the table:\n\nFor freeway 1: one car: (-48, -95, right, 48). So this is a right-moving car with τ=-95, h=-48? Then at T, the car is [-95 + 48*(T-10), -48 + 48*(T-10)].\n\nWe need to check when 0 is in that interval.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12). But wait: the first car: head=48, tail=37? Then for right-moving, the initial span at t1=10 is [37,48]. Then at T, [37+12*(T-10), 48+12*(T-10)]. The second car: head=0, tail=-11? Then initial span at t1=10 is [-11,0]. Then at T, [-11+12*(T-10), 0+12*(T-10)].\n\nBut note: the table says for freeway 2: two cars. So we have to check both.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12) -> same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: one car: (48,83,left,36) -> left-moving: at t1=10: [48,83]? Then at T: [48-36*(T-10), 83-36*(T-10)].\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4: (48,83,left,36)\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (-48,-59,right,6) -> right-moving: initial span [-59,-48] at t1=10. Then at T: [-59+6*(T-10), -48+6*(T-10)].\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4) -> same as freeway 2 but with speed 4. So at T: first car: [37+4*(T-10), 48+4*(T-10)], second car: [-11+4*(T-10), 0+4*(T-10)].\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (-48,-59,right,3) -> right-moving: initial span [-59,-48] at t1=10. Then at T: [-59+3*(T-10), -48+3*(T-10)].\n\nNow, we are going to simulate the player's movement. We start at turn 10 at y=0. We are safe at y=0.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible. The minimal number of turns is 9 (if we go up 9 times). But we have to avoid collisions on y=1 to 8.\n\nLet's check if we can go straight up from turn 10 to turn 18 (so 9 actions: U at each turn, then at turn 19 we would be at y=9? Actually, we start at turn 10 at y=0. Then:\n\nTurn 10: action U -> at turn 11, y=1.\nTurn 11: action U -> at turn 12, y=2.\n...\nTurn 17: action U -> at turn 18, y=8.\nTurn 18: action U -> at turn 19, y=9.\n\nSo we need to check from turn 11 (when we are at y=1) to turn 18 (when we are at y=8) for collisions.\n\nWe check for each freeway at the corresponding turn:\n\nAt turn 11: y=1 -> freeway 1.\n  Freeway 1: car: [-95+48*(11-10), -48+48*(11-10)] = [-95+48, -48+48] = [-47, 0]\n  Is 0 in [-47,0]? Yes, because 0 is the upper bound. So collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on freeway 1 at turn 11.\n\nSo going straight up fails at the first step.\n\nWe must wait at y=0 for some turns? Or take a detour? But note: we can only change by -1,0,1. And we are at y=0, so we cannot go below 0. So we can only do S (stay) or U (up). \n\nWe must avoid freeway 1 at turn 11. So we can either:\n  - Stay at y=0 at turn 10 (so do S at turn 10) and then go up at turn 11? Then at turn 11 we are at y=0? Then at turn 12 we go to y=1? But then we are on freeway 1 at turn 12.\n\nSo we need to check freeway 1 at turn 12: \n  [-95+48*(12-10), -48+48*(12-10)] = [-95+96, -48+96] = [1,48] -> 0 is not in [1,48] -> safe.\n\nBut wait: we are at y=1 at turn 12? Then we check freeway 1 at turn 12: [1,48] -> 0 is not in [1,48] -> safe.\n\nThen we can proceed? But we have to check the next freeways.\n\nSo let's try:\n\nTurn 10: S (stay at y=0)\nTurn 11: U -> at turn 11: we are still at y=0? Actually, no: \n  At turn 10: we are at y=0. We do S: so at turn 11, we are at y=0? Then at turn 11 we do U: then at turn 12, we are at y=1.\n\nSo at turn 12, we are at freeway 1. And as above, freeway 1 at turn 12: [1,48] -> 0 is not in [1,48] -> safe.\n\nThen turn 12: U -> at turn 13, y=2 -> freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 at turn 13:\n  Two cars:\n    First car: [37+12*(13-10), 48+12*(13-10)] = [37+36, 48+36] = [73,84] -> 0 not in [73,84]\n    Second car: [-11+12*(13-10), 0+12*(13-10)] = [-11+36, 0+36] = [25,36] -> 0 not in [25,36]\n  Safe.\n\nTurn 13: U -> at turn 14, y=3 -> freeway 3.\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? Yes, same cars: so at turn 14:\n  First car: [37+12*(14-10), 48+12*(14-10)] = [37+48, 48+48] = [85,96] -> safe.\n  Second car: [-11+12*4, 0+12*4] = [-11+48, 0+48] = [37,48] -> safe.\n\nTurn 14: U -> at turn 15, y=4 -> freeway 4.\nFreeway 4: one car: [48-36*(15-10), 83-36*(15-10)] = [48-180, 83-180] = [-132, -97] -> 0 not in this interval -> safe.\n\nTurn 15: U -> at turn 16, y=5 -> freeway 5.\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4: [48-36*(16-10), 83-36*(16-10)] = [48-216, 83-216] = [-168,-133] -> safe.\n\nTurn 16: U -> at turn 17, y=6 -> freeway 6.\nFreeway 6: [-59+6*(17-10), -48+6*(17-10)] = [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6] -> 0 not in [-17,-6] -> safe.\n\nTurn 17: U -> at turn 18, y=7 -> freeway 7.\nFreeway 7: two cars at turn 18:\n  First car: [37+4*(18-10), 48+4*(18-10)] = [37+32, 48+32] = [69,80] -> safe.\n  Second car: [-11+4*8, 0+4*8] = [-11+32, 0+32] = [21,32] -> safe.\n\nTurn 18: U -> at turn 19, y=8 -> freeway 8? But wait, we are moving to y=8 at turn 19? Actually, at turn 18 we are at y=7. Then we do U at turn 18, so at turn 19 we are at y=8. But we are then on freeway 8 at turn 19.\n\nWe must check freeway 8 at turn 19:\n  Car: [-59+3*(19-10), -48+3*(19-10)] = [-59+27, -48+27] = [-32,-21] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn 19, we are at y=8. Then we do one more U at turn 19: then at turn 20 we are at y=9.\n\nSo we have:\n\nTurn 10: S\nTurn 11: U -> at turn11: y=0 -> no freeway (safe), then at turn12: y=1 (freeway1: safe at turn12)\nTurn 12: U -> turn13: y=2 (freeway2: safe at turn13)\nTurn 13: U -> turn14: y=3 (freeway3: safe at turn14)\nTurn 14: U -> turn15: y=4 (freeway4: safe at turn15)\nTurn 15: U -> turn16: y=5 (freeway5: safe at turn16)\nTurn 16: U -> turn17: y=6 (freeway6: safe at turn17)\nTurn 17: U -> turn18: y=7 (freeway7: safe at turn18)\nTurn 18: U -> turn19: y=8 (freeway8: safe at turn19)\nTurn 19: U -> turn20: y=9 -> goal.\n\nBut wait: at turn19 we are at y=8 (freeway8) and we are safe. Then we do U at turn19 to get to y=9 at turn20.\n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9). So at turn20 we are at y=9. So we need 10 actions? From turn10 to turn19: 10 turns? Actually, we start at turn10 and do 10 actions: from t=10 to t=19, then at the end of turn19 we are at y=9? \n\nBut note: the sequence of actions: we start at turn10. We do an action at turn10, then turn11, ... until we have done H actions and we are at y=9 at the end of the last action.\n\nThe problem says: sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1, and at the end of these H actions, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn our plan: \n  Action at turn10 (t1+0): S\n  Action at turn11 (t1+1): U\n  ... \n  Action at turn19 (t1+9): U -> then at the end of turn19, we are at y=9.\n\nSo H=10.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? The minimal H is at least 9 (since we start at y=0 and need to get to y=9). But we saw that going straight up (9 actions) fails at the first step. So 10 is minimal? \n\nBut wait: we have to check if we can avoid the collision at freeway1 at turn11 by going up at turn10 and then down? But we can't go down from y=1 at turn11 because we are at y=1 and then down to y=0 at turn12? Then we are back at y=0 and then we have to go up again. That would take more than 10 turns.\n\nAlternatively, we could wait more than one turn at y=0? But that would also take more turns.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in 9 turns by a different route? Actually, we must go up 9 times. The only way to do it in 9 actions is to go up 9 times. But that forces us to be at y=1 at turn11 (if we go up at turn10) and that is unsafe.\n\nTherefore, 10 is the minimal.\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway1 at turn12: we have [1,48] at turn12. The player is at x=0, y=1 at turn12. Since the car is from 1 to 48, it does not cover 0. So safe.\n\nNow, what about the other freeways? We checked and they are safe at the corresponding turns.\n\nBut wait: freeway2 at turn13: we have two cars: [73,84] and [25,36]. Both are positive and above 0, so safe.\n\nFreeway3 at turn14: [85,96] and [37,48] -> safe.\n\nFreeway4 at turn15: [-132,-97] -> safe.\n\nFreeway5 at turn16: [-168,-133] -> safe.\n\nFreeway6 at turn17: [-17,-6] -> safe.\n\nFreeway7 at turn18: [69,80] and [21,32] -> safe.\n\nFreeway8 at turn19: [-32,-21] -> safe.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of actions starting at turn10:\n\nTurn 10: S\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n\nBut wait: at turn11 we did U, so at the end of turn11 we are at y=1? Actually, no: at the beginning of turn10 we are at (0,0). We do S at turn10: so at the end of turn10 we are still at (0,0). Then at turn11 we do U: so at the end of turn11 we are at (0,1). Then at turn12 we do U: at the end of turn12 we are at (0,2), and so on.\n\nBut in our plan, at the end of turn19 we are at (0,9). So that's correct.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions for t from 0 to H-1. Here H=10, so t=0 to 9 (which corresponds to turn10 to turn19).\n\nBut the answer format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\n...\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 10: S\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n\nBut we have 10 actions? Yes.\n\nBut note: we started at turn10 at (0,0). Then we did S at turn10 -> still (0,0) at the end of turn10. Then U at turn11 -> (0,1) at end of turn11. Then U at turn12 -> (0,2) at end of turn12. ... until U at turn19 -> (0,9) at end of turn19.\n\nSo we have 10 actions.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 10 actions without the initial stay? For example, if we go up at turn10, then we are at y=1 at turn11 -> unsafe. Then we have to avoid that by going down? But we can't go down from y=1 at turn11? Then we go to y=0 at turn12. Then we have to go up again. That would be:\n\nTurn10: U -> at turn11: y=1 -> unsafe? Actually, we must avoid collision. So we cannot do that.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up at turn10 to y=1 at turn11 (unsafe) but then we might wait at y=1? But at turn11 we are at y=1 and then we do S? But at turn11 we are on freeway1 and the car is at [-47,0] -> 0 is covered? So if we are at y=1 at turn11 and x=0, then we are in the car? So we must avoid that.\n\nTherefore, the only safe way is to wait at y=0 for one turn.\n\nSo the plan above is minimal.\n\nBut note: we have to check if we can get to y=9 earlier by a different sequence? For example, by going down at some point? But we are at the bottom, and going down is not possible. And if we go up to y=1 and then down to y=0, that would take two turns and we are back to start. So it would be longer.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\nTurn 10: S\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n\nBut wait: at turn19 we do the last U to get to y=9. So that's 10 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: the minimal number of turns H. We have H=10.\n\nBut let me check if we can skip the last U? No, because we are at y=8 at the end of turn19? Actually, no: at the end of turn18 we are at y=7 (because we did U at turn18: from y=7 at the start of turn18 to y=8 at the end of turn18? No: \n\nAt the end of turn17: we are at y=7 (because we did U at turn17: from y=6 at start of turn17 to y=7 at end of turn17). Then at turn18: we do U -> so at end of turn18: y=8. Then at turn19: we do U -> at end of turn19: y=9.\n\nSo we need the U at turn19.\n\nBut wait: we are at y=8 at the end of turn18. Then we don't need to do an action? But we haven't reached y=9. So we must do one more U at turn19.\n\nAlternatively, we could have been at y=8 at the end of turn18 and then we do nothing? But we have to reach y=9. So we must do at least one more U.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is 10 actions.\n\nBut let me see if we can compress by moving faster? We can only move one step per turn.\n\nAnother idea: what if we wait at a different freeway? But we are only allowed to move one step per turn, so we cannot skip freeways. We must go through each y from 0 to 9.\n\nSo the minimal H is 10.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: S\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Here t1=10, and t from 0 to 9 (H=10) so the actions are at turns 10 to 19.\n\nBut the last action is at turn19. Then at the end of turn19, we are at y=9.\n\nSo this is correct.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway1 at turn12: \n  The car: [-95+48*(12-10) = -95+96=1, and -48+96=48] -> [1,48]. The player is at x=0, which is not in [1,48] -> safe.\n\nAnd freeway8 at turn19: \n  The car: [-59+3*(19-10) = -59+27=-32, and -48+27=-21] -> [-32,-21]. 0 is not in that interval -> safe.\n\nAll others are safe as previously computed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn 10 while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to y = 8, the minimal number of turns required is 10. The sequence of actions is designed to safely navigate through each freeway by waiting at y = 0 for one turn to avoid a collision on freeway 1 at turn 11, then moving up consistently.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 10**: Stay (S) to remain at y = 0, avoiding freeway 1 at turn 11 where a car would cover x = 0.\n- **Turn 11**: Move up (U) to y = 1 at turn 12. At turn 12, freeway 1 is safe as the car spans [1, 48], not covering x = 0.\n- **Turns 12 to 19**: Continue moving up (U) each turn to increment y by 1 per turn, reaching y = 9 by the end of turn 19.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1) at turn 12**: Car span = [-95 + 48*(12-10), -48 + 48*(12-10)] = [1, 48]. 0 ∉ [1, 48] → safe.\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2) at turn 13**: \n  - Car 1: [37 + 12*(13-10), 48 + 12*(13-10)] = [73, 84] → 0 ∉ [73, 84].\n  - Car 2: [-11 + 12*(13-10), 0 + 12*(13-10)] = [25, 36] → 0 ∉ [25, 36] → safe.\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3) at turn 14**: \n  - Car 1: [37 + 12*(14-10), 48 + 12*(14-10)] = [85, 96] → 0 ∉ [85, 96].\n  - Car 2: [-11 + 12*(14-10), 0 + 12*(14-10)] = [37, 48] → 0 ∉ [37, 48] → safe.\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4) at turn 15**: Car span = [48 - 36*(15-10), 83 - 36*(15-10)] = [-132, -97] → 0 ∉ [-132, -97] → safe.\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5) at turn 16**: Car span = [48 - 36*(16-10), 83 - 36*(16-10)] = [-168, -133] → 0 ∉ [-168, -133] → safe.\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6) at turn 17**: Car span = [-59 + 6*(17-10), -48 + 6*(17-10)] = [-17, -6] → 0 ∉ [-17, -6] → safe.\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7) at turn 18**: \n  - Car 1: [37 + 4*(18-10), 48 + 4*(18-10)] = [69, 80] → 0 ∉ [69, 80].\n  - Car 2: [-11 + 4*(18-10), 0 + 4*(18-10)] = [21, 32] → 0 ∉ [21, 32] → safe.\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8) at turn 19**: Car span = [-59 + 3*(19-10), -48 + 3*(19-10)] = [-32, -21] → 0 ∉ [-32, -21] → safe.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches (0, 9) in 10 turns (H = 10) without collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: S\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 11, and the player is at (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8).\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The movement is in the y-direction only, and the x-coordinate is always 0.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is at freeway y (between 1 and 8) at that turn and the car's span at that turn includes x=0.\n\nImportant: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the exact moment of turn T, the player is still on y_T. Therefore, at turn T, we check for collision only on the current freeway y_T. When we move, we are not present on the next freeway until the next turn.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1=11. We need to simulate the movement of the cars for future turns. The cars move at constant speeds.\n\nFor a car at freeway k (which is fixed), given (head, tail, direction, speed) at turn 11, we can compute the span at any turn T (>=11) as:\n\nIf direction is 'left':\n  head(T) = head(t1) - s*(T - t1)\n  tail(T) = tail(t1) - s*(T - t1)\n\nIf direction is 'right':\n  head(T) = head(t1) + s*(T - t1)\n  tail(T) = tail(t1) + s*(T - t1)\n\nNote: For left-moving cars, the head is the leading part? Actually, the problem says:\n  Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  Right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the representation for right-moving: at t1, the span is [τ, h] meaning from τ to h (with τ <= h). Then at T, it becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: at t1, the span is [h, τ] meaning from h to τ? But note that h and τ are given, and for left-moving, the head is at the left? Actually, the problem says: \n  Left-moving: [h, τ] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut if h is the head and τ is the tail, and the car is moving left, then the head is the leftmost? Actually, the problem does not specify the order. However, note that the span is defined as an interval that includes the car. We can interpret:\n\nFor a left-moving car, the car moves to the left, so the entire car shifts left. The initial span [h, τ] (with h and τ being the endpoints) becomes shifted by -s*(T-t1). So the new head is h - s*(T-t1) and the new tail is τ - s*(T-t1). But note: if the car is moving left, the head (front) is at the left, so we expect h > τ? Actually, the problem does not specify the order of h and τ. Looking at the data:\n\nExample: \n  Freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48) -> for right-moving, the span is [τ, h] = [-47, 0] at t1=11? But wait, the representation in the table is (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nBut the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\". So the head is the larger coordinate? Actually, for right-moving, the head is the front, which would be the rightmost. So the head h is the larger coordinate and tail τ is the smaller. Similarly, for left-moving, the head is the front (leftmost) and tail is the rightmost? But then the span for left-moving would be [head, tail] with head < tail? But the problem writes [h, τ] and then subtracts s*(T-t1) so that the entire interval moves left.\n\nHowever, looking at the data:\n\nFreeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48) -> head=0, tail=-47. For right-moving, the head is the front (so at 0) and tail at -47. Then the span at t1 is from -47 to 0? But the problem says for right-moving: the span is [τ, h] = [-47, 0]. Then at turn T, it becomes [-47 + 48*(T-11), 0 + 48*(T-11)].\n\nBut wait, the problem says for right-moving: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So that matches.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 4: (12, 47, left, 36). Here head=12, tail=47? Then the initial span is [12,47]? But if it's moving left, then at turn T, the span becomes [12 - 36*(T-11), 47 - 36*(T-11)]. However, note that if head=12 and tail=47, and it's moving left, then the head (front) is at 12 and the tail at 47? That would mean the car extends from 12 to 47, which is to the right of 12. But when moving left, the front (head) should be the leftmost? This seems inconsistent.\n\nLet me re-read the problem: \n  For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail at τ at turn t1.\n\nAnd then for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → becomes [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nBut if the car is moving left, then the head is the leftmost? Then the tail would be to the right of the head. So we should have h < τ? But in the data for freeway 4: head=12, tail=47 -> so 12<47, so the car spans [12,47]. When moving left, the entire car moves left, so the new span is [12 - 36*(T-11), 47 - 36*(T-11)].\n\nSimilarly, for a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost, so the tail is to the left. So in freeway 1: head=0, tail=-47 -> so the car spans [-47,0] and moves right.\n\nSo the representation is consistent: the head is the leading part in the direction of motion, and the tail is the trailing part. The span is from the tail to the head? Actually, note:\n\n- For right-moving: the head is the rightmost, so the tail is the leftmost. The problem says the span is [τ, h] meaning from tail (left) to head (right). So the interval [τ, h] is increasing.\n\n- For left-moving: the head is the leftmost, the tail is the rightmost. The problem says the span is [h, τ]? But if h is the leftmost and τ the rightmost, then [h, τ] would be an increasing interval? But the problem writes [h, τ] and then subtracts, so the entire interval moves left. However, if h < τ, then [h, τ] is increasing. But if the car is long, we have to know the entire interval.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"head\" and \"tail\", so the tail is the end of the car. In the left-moving example, the head is the front (leftmost) and the tail is the rear (rightmost). So the car occupies [head, tail] = [h, τ] with h < τ.\n\nTherefore, the representation is that the car occupies a contiguous interval [min, max] regardless of direction? Actually, no: for left-moving, the head is at h (the leftmost) and tail at τ (the rightmost), so the interval is [h, τ]. For right-moving, the head is at h (the rightmost) and tail at τ (the leftmost), so the interval is [τ, h]. So the problem is representing the interval in the order from the tail to the head? That is, for right-moving: tail (left) to head (right) -> [τ, h]. For left-moving: tail (right) to head (left) -> but that would be [τ, h] with τ>h? But the problem writes [h, τ] for left-moving. So let me clarify:\n\n- Left-moving: the head is at the left, tail at the right. So the span is [head, tail] = [h, τ] and we have h <= τ? Actually, if the car is moving left, the head is the leftmost, so h should be less than τ. Then [h, τ] is the interval.\n\n- Right-moving: the head is at the right, tail at the left. So the span is [tail, head] = [τ, h] and we have τ <= h.\n\nTherefore, the given data:\n\nFreeway 1: (head=0, tail=-47, right, 48) -> [τ, h] = [-47, 0]\n\nFreeway 2: two cars: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12). For the first: head=60, tail=49 -> [49,60] (but wait, tail=49 and head=60, so [49,60]. For the second: head=12, tail=1 -> [1,12].\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2.\n\nFreeway 4: (12,47,left,36) -> [12,47] (because left-moving: [h,τ] = [12,47])\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4.\n\nFreeway 6: (-42,-53,right,6) -> head=-42, tail=-53 -> [τ, h] = [-53,-42]? But the problem says for right-moving: [τ, h] and since τ=-53, h=-42, then [-53,-42].\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (52,41,right,4) -> [41,52] and (4,-7,right,4) -> [-7,4]\n\nFreeway 8: (-45,-56,right,3) -> [-56,-45]\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is at freeway y (which is from 1 to 8) and at that turn, there is a car on that freeway whose span includes x=0.\n\nSo for each freeway we have one or more cars. We need to check for each turn T and for each freeway that the player is on at that turn, whether any car on that freeway has a span that contains 0.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and a sequence of actions from turn 11 to turn 11+H-1 (so H actions) such that at the end the player is at y=9.\n\nThe player starts at y=0 at turn 11. We are at turn 11, and we choose an action for turn 11, which will determine y_12, and so on.\n\nNote: at turn T, the player is at y_T. We must avoid collision at every turn T from 11 to 11+H-1 (except when the player is at y=0 or y=9, because freeways are y=1..8, so at y=0 and y=9 there are no cars).\n\nTherefore, we only worry about collisions when the player is at y in {1,2,...,8}.\n\nWe need to simulate the movement of the cars for future turns. We are at turn 11, so for turn T (>=11), the car positions are as computed.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H. Since we can only move one step at a time (or stay), the minimal H without any obstacles would be 9 steps (from y=0 to y=9, with 9 moves up). But there are obstacles, so we might have to wait (stay) or even move down.\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over the state (turn, y) to find the minimal H. The state is (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at t1=11) and y in [0,9]. The goal is to reach y=9.\n\nAt each state (t, y), we can choose an action a in {U, D, S} which leads to:\n\n  y_next = \n      if U: y+1 (if y<9)\n      if D: y-1 (if y>0)\n      if S: y\n\nThen the next state is (t+1, y_next).\n\nBut we must avoid states where at the current state (t, y) we are on a freeway (y in [1,8]) and there is a collision at (t, y). Note: the collision check is at the current turn t and current freeway y.\n\nWe do not check collision for the next state until we are at that state? Actually, when we are at state (t, y), we are at turn t and freeway y (if y in [1,8]), so we must check at that turn.\n\nSo the algorithm:\n\n  Let Q be a queue. Start with state (t=11, y=0, path=[]). Mark visited states (t,y) to avoid cycles? But since time increases and we are only moving in y, we might revisit the same y at a later turn? But that is allowed. However, we are minimizing the number of turns. We can use Dijkstra (with cost = number of turns) or BFS by time.\n\nSince we are minimizing the number of turns, and each action takes one turn, we can do BFS by increasing t.\n\nBut note: the state space: t can be large? However, the cars move continuously and the obstacles are periodic? Actually, the cars move at constant speeds, so the pattern of obstacles on a freeway is periodic. But the periods might be different per freeway.\n\nAlternatively, we can simulate turn by turn and check collisions.\n\nWe want the minimal H, so we can try to find the minimal H by increasing H from 0 upwards? But we start at y=0, and we need to get to y=9, so H at least 9.\n\nWe can do a BFS that expands (t, y) and stops when we reach y=9.\n\nSteps:\n\n  Initialize:\n      t0 = 11\n      y0 = 0\n      queue: [(11,0, [])]   # (turn, y, path_so_far)\n\n  While queue not empty:\n      pop state (t, y, path)\n      if y == 9: we found a solution, H = len(path) [because we started at t0 without an action, but note: we are at turn t and we have taken actions from 11 to t-1?]\n\n  Actually, we start at turn 11 at y=0. Then we choose an action for turn 11, which will lead to state at turn 12. So the state (t, y) means that at turn t, we are at y.\n\n  Therefore, at the initial state: (11,0) and we have not taken any action yet? But the problem requires to output actions starting from turn 11.\n\n  We can consider: at state (t, y), we are about to choose an action for turn t. Then we simulate:\n\n      For each action a in [U, D, S]:\n          y_next = y + delta(a)   (clamped to [0,9])\n          Then we check: at turn t, if we are at y (the current y) and if y is in [1,8], we must check that there is no collision at (t, y) with the cars on freeway y.\n\n          However, note: we are at (t, y) and we are going to move to y_next at the next state. The collision check for the current state (t,y) is independent of the next move.\n\n          So we must check the current state: if y in [1,8] and at turn t, there is a car on freeway y that covers 0, then this state is invalid? But we are at (t,y) and we are going to choose an action to leave. But if at turn t we are at freeway y and there is a car at 0, then we collide.\n\n          Therefore, we must check the current state (t,y) for collision? Actually, the state (t,y) is the state we are at at the beginning of turn t? But the problem says: collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T and a car on that freeway has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\n          So when we are at (t,y), we are at freeway y at turn t. Therefore, we must check that if y is in [1,8], then no car on freeway y has 0 in its span at turn t.\n\n          If y==0 or y==9, no collision.\n\n      Then, if the current state (t,y) is safe, we can choose an action and move to the next state.\n\n      The next state is (t+1, y_next).\n\n      Then we check the next state for collision when we are at (t+1, y_next)? Actually, we check the next state when we expand it? Or we check the next state immediately?\n\n      Actually, we can do:\n\n          At state (t,y): \n             if y in [1,8] and there is a collision at (t,y): then we cannot be at this state -> skip.\n          Otherwise, for each action, we compute next state (t+1, y_next) and then when we get to that state, we will check collision at (t+1, y_next).\n\n      But note: the initial state: at turn 11, y=0 -> safe. Then we choose an action for turn 11, which leads to state (12, y_next). Then at state (12, y_next), we check collision at turn 12 and freeway y_next (if y_next in [1,8]).\n\n  Therefore, the initial state is (11,0) and we do not check collision for (11,0) because y=0 is safe.\n\n  Then we generate the next states by applying actions at turn 11.\n\n  We mark a state (t,y) as visited? But we might come to the same y at a later turn and that might be a different path. Since we are minimizing the number of turns, we can use the time t and y as state. However, if we get to the same (t,y) by two different paths, we only need to keep one (the one with the same or lower cost). But since we are doing BFS by time (each step increases t by 1), then the first time we reach (t,y) is the minimal number of turns. Therefore, we can mark (t,y) as visited.\n\n  Algorithm:\n\n      Let dist[t][y] = minimal number of turns taken to reach (t,y) from (11,0). We are interested in the minimal t such that y=9.\n\n      We can use a queue (BFS) that processes states in order of increasing t.\n\n      Steps:\n\n          Initialize: \n             dist[11][0] = 0, and we start at (11,0).\n\n          For each state (t, y) popped from the queue (with minimal t):\n             if y == 9: then we have a solution. The number of turns is the number of actions taken? Actually, the number of actions taken is t - 11 (because we started at turn 11 without having taken an action). But we have taken an action for each turn from 11 to t-1? Actually:\n\n                 At turn 11: we start at (11,0). Then we take an action at turn 11 to move to (12, y1). Then at turn 12: we are at (12,y1). \n\n                 So to get to (t,y), we have taken (t - 11) actions.\n\n             Then we can reconstruct the actions from the path.\n\n          If we haven't reached the goal, then for each action in [U, D, S]:\n             y_next = y + delta(a)  [clamped to 0<=y_next<=9]\n\n             Then the next state is (t+1, y_next).\n\n             But we must check the next state for collision? Actually, no: we must check the current state (t,y) for collision? But we already did that when we entered the state? Actually, no: we did not check (t,y) for collision when we entered? We must check the state (t,y) for collision at the time we are going to leave it? \n\n          Correction:\n\n             The state (t,y) must be safe at turn t. So when we are at (t,y), we must check that if y is in [1,8], then no car on freeway y at turn t has 0 in its span.\n\n          Therefore, when we pop (t,y) from the queue, we first check if (t,y) is safe? But if we stored (t,y) without checking, we might have stored an unsafe state. So we should check at the time of expansion? Actually, we can check when generating the next states.\n\n          How about:\n\n            We generate the next state (t+1, y_next) from (t,y) by action a. But to be at (t,y) we must be safe? So we must ensure that (t,y) is safe.\n\n          Therefore, when we pop (t,y) from the queue, we check if (t,y) is safe? If it is not, then we skip this state.\n\n          Then, if it is safe, then for each action, we compute next state (t+1, y_next). Then we will check (t+1, y_next) when we pop it? But we must record the path.\n\n          However, the state (t+1, y_next) might be generated multiple times? So we mark (t+1, y_next) as visited and skip if we have been there? But we are doing BFS by time, so we will get to (t+1, y_next) at the same time.\n\n          So:\n\n            For each state (t,y) popped from the queue (which is the earliest time we reached (t,y)):\n               if y in [1,8]: check collision at (t,y) for freeway y. If collision, skip this state (and we don't expand from it).\n               else (y=0 or y=9): safe.\n\n               If we skipped, then we don't expand.\n\n            If we reached y=9, then output.\n\n            Otherwise, for each action a in [U, D, S]:\n                 y_next = clamp(y + delta(a), 0, 9)\n                 Then the next state is (t+1, y_next). If we haven't visited (t+1, y_next) (i.e., we haven't seen that state at that time), then we add it to the queue and record the action a and the path.\n\n          But note: we might get to the same (t+1, y_next) from multiple states? Then we want the first time we get to (t+1, y_next) because that will have the minimal t. So we mark (t,y) as visited at the time we pop it? Actually, we can mark when we first see (t,y). We do:\n\n            We maintain an array \"visited\" for (t,y) for t from 11 to ... and y in [0,9]. Since t can be large, we might use a dictionary or we can use a set.\n\n          However, we are minimizing the time t, so the first time we reach (t,y) is the best. Therefore, we can mark (t,y) as visited as soon as we generate it? Actually, we can do:\n\n            We use a queue (min-heap by t) or a simple queue (BFS) because each step is +1 in time.\n\n            We maintain a 2D array \"visited\" for y in [0,9] and we note the minimal t at which we reached y. But note: we might want to revisit y at a later time if the earlier path was blocked? But in our BFS, the first time we reach (t,y) is the minimal t. And if we found a state (t,y) and then we later find a state (t',y) with t'>t, we don't need to consider because the minimal t is already found. Therefore, we can mark a state y as visited at the minimal t we reached it. But note: we might have a state (t,y) that is unsafe (collision) and then we skip it, but then we need to consider later states? \n\n          Therefore, we do:\n\n            We maintain an array \"min_time\" for y: min_time[y] = minimal t at which we have reached y. Initially, min_time[0]=11, and others infinity.\n\n            Then when we generate (t+1, y_next) from (t,y) (which is safe), then if t+1 < min_time[y_next], we update and push (t+1, y_next) into the queue.\n\n          But note: we might have multiple paths to the same (t,y) and we only care about the minimal t.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Let Q be a queue (FIFO) since each step is 1 turn. We start at (11,0). Then we process in increasing t.\n\n            For each state (t,y) we pop, we mark min_time[y] = min(min_time[y], t) but if we already had a state with a lower t for the same y, we skip? Actually, we can skip if we have already reached y at a time <= t? \n\n          However, note: if we reached y at time t0 < t, then we don't need to process (t,y) because the path with t0 is better. Therefore, we can skip if we have seen y at a time <= t? But we are processing in increasing t, so if we have already set min_time[y] <= t, we skip.\n\n          But we must check safety at (t,y): if it is unsafe, we skip and do not expand.\n\n          Algorithm:\n\n            Let min_time = array of size 10 (for y=0..9) with min_time[y] = infinity, except min_time[0]=11.\n\n            Let Q = deque([(11,0, [])])   # (t, y, path_actions)  where path_actions is the list of actions from turn 11 to t-1.\n\n            While Q:\n                pop state (t, y, path)\n                if min_time[y] < t:  # we have reached y at an earlier time, skip\n                    continue\n                # Now, check safety at (t,y): if y in [1,8] -> check collision at freeway y at turn t.\n                if y in range(1,9):\n                    if there is a car on freeway y that has 0 in its span at turn t: \n                        # collision! skip this state and do not expand.\n                        continue\n                # If we reached the goal?\n                if y == 9:\n                    # then we have a solution: the path has (t-11) actions? \n                    # Actually, the path we have is the list of actions taken from turn 11 to turn t-1? \n                    # But we are at (t,y) meaning we have taken actions for turns 11 to t-1 (which is t-11 actions) and we are at y=9 at turn t.\n                    # Therefore, we output the actions: for turn 11: the first action in path, etc.\n                    # The path list has the actions for turns: 11, 12, ..., t-1. So H = t-11? But the problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} and we want to minimize H such that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\n                    # At turn t, we are at y=9. The last action was taken at turn t-1? Actually, the state (t,y) is the state at the beginning of turn t? But the problem: at turn t, we choose an action a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\n                    # But our state (t,y) is: at turn t, we are at y. Then we choose an action at turn t to go to the next state at turn t+1.\n\n                    # So if we are at (t,9) and we have not taken an action at turn t? But the goal is reached at turn t? The problem says: we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\n                    # In our representation, we are at (0,9) at turn t. And we have taken actions from turn 11 to turn t-1? That is, we have taken H = t - 11 actions? But then the turn at which we are at (0,9) is t = 11+H? \n\n                    # Let me clarify:\n\n                    #   Turn 11: we start at (11,0). We choose action a_11 -> then at turn 12, we are at y_12 = 0 + delta(a_11).\n\n                    #   So after H actions, we have taken actions at turns: 11, 12, ..., 11+H-1. Then at turn 11+H, we are at y_{11+H}.\n\n                    #   We want y_{11+H-1} = 9? \n\n                    # Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from t1 to t1+H-1. Then at the end of the sequence, we are at turn t1+H-1? and we require that at that turn, the position is (0,9).\n\n                    # But our state: at turn t (which is >=11), we are at y. Then we have taken actions at turns 11 to t-1. So the last action was at turn t-1, and we are at turn t at y.\n\n                    # Therefore, to be at y=9 at turn t, we must have t = 11+H? Then the number of actions is H = t - 11.\n\n                    # But the problem says the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1. So the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H-1 we have taken that action and then we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\n                    # However, note the update: \n                    #   y_{t+1} = y_t + delta(a_t)\n                    #   So after taking action a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1, we have y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + delta(a_{t1+H-1})\n\n                    # We require that at turn t1+H-1, the position is (0,9)? But then the action at turn t1+H-1 would change it? \n\n                    # Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1. \n\n                    # So we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. Then we do not take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\n                    # But the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1, meaning we take H actions. Then after taking the last action at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9) at that same turn? \n\n                    # How the game works:\n\n                    #   At turn t, we are at position (0, y_t). Then we choose an action a_t. Then we move to y_{t+1} = y_t + delta(a_t) at turn t+1.\n\n                    #   Therefore, the position at turn t is (0,y_t). We require that at turn T = t1+H-1, we have y_T = 9.\n\n                    #   Then we do not take an action at turn T? But the sequence of actions includes a_T? \n\n                    #   The sequence is {a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}}. The last action is at turn t1+H-1. Then after that action, at turn t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H}. But we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? \n\n                    #   Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\n                    #   So at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0, y_{t1+H-1}), and we choose an action a_{t1+H-1}. Then after the action, we move to y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + delta(a_{t1+H-1}).\n\n                    #   But we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). So y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\n                    #   Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? But then we move to 10? or 8? or 9? \n\n                    #   The problem says: we require to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. Then we don't care what happens after? \n\n                    #   And the sequence of actions includes the action at turn t1+H-1? \n\n                    #   However, note: if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, and we take an action at that turn, then we move to 8,9,10? But 10 is not allowed, so we clamp to 9. So if we take action U: 9+1 -> 9? (clamped) or S: 9, or D:8.\n\n                    #   But the problem does not say we have to remain at 9. It only says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". So we can be at 9 at turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action (which might move us) at the same turn? But the collision condition at turn t1+H-1: if we are at freeway 9? but 9 is not a freeway (freeways are 1..8). So no collision at y=9.\n\n                    #   Therefore, we can be at 9 at turn t1+H-1, and we must take an action? But the sequence of actions is H actions, including the one at turn t1+H-1.\n\n                    #   However, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\", meaning that the last action we take we are at 9? \n\n                    #   But note: the update: we are at y_t at turn t, then we take action a_t and then we are at y_{t+1} at turn t+1. So to be at 9 at turn t, we do not need to take an action at turn t? \n\n                    #   Actually, the state at turn t is y_t. We take action a_t at turn t to move to y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\n                    #   Therefore, to be at y_t = 9 at turn t, we have already taken an action at turn t-1.\n\n                    #   So the sequence of actions we take is from turn 11 to turn t-1 (if we are at turn t). Then the number of actions is t - 11. Then we are at 9 at turn t, and we have taken actions at turns 11 to t-1. Then H = t - 11, and the last action was at turn t-1.\n\n                    #   But the problem requires that the sequence of actions is for turns from t1 to t1+H-1. So that matches: turns 11 to (11 + (t-11) - 1) = t-1.\n\n                    #   And we require that at turn t1+H-1 = t-1? we are at (0,9)? \n\n                    #   Actually, no: at turn t1+H-1 = t-1, we are at y_{t-1}. Then we take action a_{t-1} and then at turn t we are at y_t = y_{t-1} + delta(a_{t-1}).\n\n                    #   Therefore, to have y_t = 9, we require that at turn t we are at 9. And the last action at turn t-1 led us to 9.\n\n                    #   But the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". Here, t1+H-1 = t-1. But at turn t-1, we are at y_{t-1}, not 9.\n\n                    #   This is a discrepancy.\n\n          Let me re-read the problem:\n\n            \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), ...\"\n\n            and then: \"the sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1, so the actions are for turns: t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\n            Then after taking these H actions, we are at turn t1+H? But the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"?\n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\n          How can that be? \n\n            Turn t1: we start at (0, y_{t1}) -> that is (0,0). \n            We take an action a_{t1} at turn t1, then at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}.\n            ...\n            We take the last action at turn t1+H-1, then at turn t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H}.\n\n          So to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, that means that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} at that turn? But then we move to y_{t1+H} = 9 + delta(a). \n\n          But the problem does not require that we stay at 9? It only requires that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). Then we are free to move after? \n\n          However, the goal is reached at turn t1+H-1. So we stop after that turn? \n\n          But the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". So the last action we take is at turn t1+H-1, and at the same turn, we are at (0,9) at the beginning of the turn? \n\n          How can we be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? That means we were already there at the end of turn t1+H-2? \n\n          The update:\n\n            At turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta(a_t).\n\n          Therefore, y_{t1+H-1} is the position at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. This y_{t1+H-1} is set by the action at turn t1+H-2.\n\n          So to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9, we must have been moved to 9 by the action at turn t1+H-2.\n\n          Then at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} at that turn? But the sequence includes H actions, so the last action is at turn t1+H-1.\n\n          But the goal is reached at turn t1+H-1 (at the beginning) and then we take an action? \n\n          However, the problem does not require that we stay at 9, only that we are there at that turn. And then we take an action? \n\n          But note the collision: at turn t1+H-1, we are at freeway 9? which is not a freeway, so no collision. So it is safe.\n\n          Therefore, we can be at 9 at turn t1+H-1, and then we take any action (it doesn't matter) because the goal is already reached at that turn? \n\n          But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has H actions. So the last action is at turn t1+H-1.\n\n          Therefore, we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1, and then we move to y_{t1+H} = 9 + delta(a). But we don't care about y_{t1+H} as long as we were at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\n          So in our BFS, we can stop when we are at y=9 at turn t (any t). Then the number of actions is H = t - 11? But note: at turn 11 (the start) we are at 0. Then:\n\n             turn 11: we are at 0 -> then we take an action at turn 11 -> then at turn 12, we are at y12.\n             ...\n             at turn t-1: we take an action -> at turn t, we are at y_t.\n\n          We want y_t = 9? But the problem wants to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\n          If we are at 9 at turn t, then that turn is t = 11 + H? Because we took H actions at turns 11,12,...,11+H-1, and then at turn 11+H we are at 9.\n\n          But the problem requires to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 11+H-1.\n\n          So we are off by one.\n\n          How to reconcile?\n\n          The problem states: \"the sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" -> actions at turns: t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\n          And after taking these actions, the player is at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\n          But according to the update rule, after taking an action at turn s, the new position is at turn s+1.\n\n          Therefore, after taking the last action at turn t1+H-1, the position becomes y_{t1+H} at turn t1+H.\n\n          So to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, that means that the action taken at turn t1+H-2 moved us to 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\n          And then at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9, and we take an action (the last one) at turn t1+H-1, which moves us to y_{t1+H} = 9 + delta(a_{t1+H-1]).\n\n          But the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. It does not require that we remain there. So that is satisfied.\n\n          Therefore, we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\n          How do we achieve that in our simulation?\n\n          In our state (t,y), we are at turn t and position y.\n\n          We want to find a state (t,9) for some t>=11, and the path to it has actions from turn 11 to turn t-1 (which is t-11 actions). Then H = number of actions = t - 11.\n\n          But the problem says the sequence of actions is for turns 11 to 11+H-1, which is also t-11 actions. And the turn at which we are at 9 is t = 11+H-1? \n\n          Let me see: \n            H = t - 11.\n            Then the last action is at turn 11+H-1 = 11 + (t-11) - 1 = t-1.\n            Then at turn t, we are at 9.\n\n          But the problem requires to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 11+H-1 = t-1.\n\n          This is not matching.\n\n          Alternatively, we might interpret the state (t,y) as the state after having taken the actions at turns 11 to t-1, so at turn t, we are at y. And we require that at turn t, we are at 9. Then the last action was at turn t-1. Then the number of actions is t-11.\n\n          But the problem wants to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1, which would be turn t-1? if t = 11+H-1, then H = t - 10.\n\n          This is confusing.\n\n          Let me assume an example: \n            Start at turn 11, y11=0.\n            We want to be at 9 at turn 11+H-1.\n\n          How many actions? \n            The actions are taken at turns: 11, 12, ..., 11+H-1. That is H actions.\n\n          The position at turn 11+H-1 is determined by the actions taken at turns 11 to 11+H-2. The action at turn 11+H-1 is taken at the same turn, but then the effect is at turn 11+H.\n\n          Therefore, to be at 9 at turn 11+H-1, we must have been moved to 9 by the action at turn 11+H-2. Then at the beginning of turn 11+H-1, we are at 9.\n\n          Then we take the last action at turn 11+H-1.\n\n          So in our BFS, we are at state (t,y) meaning at turn t, we are at y. We want to find a state (t,9) for t = 11+H-1.\n\n          And the number of actions taken to get to (t,9) is (t - 11) because we took an action at each turn from 11 to t-1.\n\n          But then H = number of actions = t - 11.\n\n          And we are at turn t = 11+H-1? \n             => 11+H-1 = 11 + (t-11) - 1 = t-1.\n\n          This is not matching.\n\n          Alternatively, if we are at (t,9), then we have taken actions at turns 11 to t-1, which is (t-11) actions. Then we require that turn t = 11+H-1. Therefore, H = t - 10.\n\n          But then the number of actions is H = t-10, and also the number of actions is t-11, so t-11 = t-10 -> impossible.\n\n          This indicates a off-by-one.\n\n          Let me redefine the state:\n\n            Let state (t,y) be the state at the beginning of turn t, BEFORE taking any action at turn t.\n\n          Then:\n\n            At turn 11: state (11,0) -> then we take action a11.\n            Then we move to state (12, y12 = 0 + delta(a11)).\n\n          To be at 9 at the beginning of turn T, we have state (T,9). \n\n          The actions we have taken are for turns 11 to T-1, which is (T-11) actions.\n\n          The turn T is the turn at which we are at 9, and the problem wants us to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\n          So T = 11+H-1.\n\n          Then the number of actions is H = T - 11 + 1? \n             actions = turns from 11 to T-1 -> count = T-11.\n             but we also take an action at turn T? -> no, because at state (T,9) we haven't taken the action for turn T yet.\n\n          The sequence of actions is for turns 11 to 11+H-1. So the last action is at turn 11+H-1 = T.\n\n          But in our state, we haven't taken the action for turn T yet. \n\n          Therefore, to have the actions for turns 11 to 11+H-1, we need to have taken the action for turn T. \n\n          So after state (T,9), we take an action a_T. Then we move to state (T+1, y_{T+1} = 9+delta(a_T)).\n\n          But we don't care about state (T+1) because the problem only requires to be at 9 at turn T = 11+H-1.\n\n          Therefore, we can stop as soon as we reach state (T,9) for any T>=11. Then the number of actions in the sequence is (T - 11) [actions from 11 to T-1] plus one for the action at turn T? \n\n          But wait, the actions from 11 to T-1 are T-11 actions, and then we take one more action at turn T. So total actions = T - 11 + 1 = T - 10.\n\n          Then H = T - 10.\n\n          And T = 11+H-1 -> T = 10+H -> H = T-10, which matches.\n\n          Therefore, when we find a state (T,9), then the number of turns H = T - 10, and the actions are for turns 11 to T (inclusive) -> turns: 11,12,...,T. That is H = T - 10 actions? because the number of actions is T-10.\n\n          Example: \n             T = 11: then H = 1, actions for turns 11 to 11 -> one action.\n             But we start at (11,0), then we take an action at turn 11 to move to (12,y). We are not at 9 at turn 11.\n\n          How do we get to (11,9)? we cannot.\n\n          Another example: \n             Suppose we are at (20,9). Then H = 20-10 = 10 actions.\n             The actions are taken at turns 11,12,...,20 -> 10 actions.\n\n          And at turn 20 = 11+10-1 = 20, we are at 9.\n\n          Therefore, in our BFS, we stop when we find a state (T,9) for any T>=11. Then the number of actions is H = T - 10.\n\n          But note: at state (T,9), we haven't taken the action for turn T yet. But the problem requires a sequence of actions for turns 11 to 11+H-1 = T. So we must take an action at turn T. What action? \n\n          Since the goal is to be at 9 at turn T (at the beginning), and then we take any action, we can choose a safe action. But the action at turn T is required, and it can be any action because after that we don't care.\n\n          However, the action at turn T might be constrained by the clamping: if we choose U, then we try to go to 10, which clamps to 9. Similarly, D would go to 8, but then we are not at 9 anymore, but the goal is already met at the beginning of turn T.\n\n          So any action is valid for turn T.\n\n          Therefore, in our BFS, when we reach a state (T,9), we can output the path for turns 11 to T-1, and then for turn T we can choose any action (e.g., 'S' for simplicity).\n\n          But wait, our BFS does not include the action for turn T in the path yet. In our state (T,9), we got here by the actions from 11 to T-1. Then we need to add one more action for turn T.\n\n          Therefore, the total number of actions is (T-11) + 1 = T-10.\n\n          And the sequence is the path we have (actions for 11 to T-1) plus one action for turn T.\n\n          However, in our BFS, we haven't chosen the action for turn T. So we can append any action (say 'S') for turn T.\n\n          But note: at state (T,9), we must check safety for (T,9) -> but y=9, so no collision. Then we can take any action.\n\n          Therefore, the plan in the BFS: we stop when we first reach any state (T,9) for T>=11. Then the actions are the path for turns 11 to T-1 (which we have) and then we add one more action for turn T (e.g., 'S').\n\n          And H = T-10.\n\n          But is there a possibility that we might get to (T,9) with a smaller T? We do BFS by time, so the first time we reach (T,9) will have minimal T, and hence minimal H.\n\n          However, note that we might have a state (T,9) that is unsafe? But y=9 is safe. So any state (T,9) is safe.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n            In the BFS, when we pop (t,y), if y==9, then we output the actions: \n               actions = path   # which is actions for turns 11 to t-1\n               then we need to add one more action for turn t: say 'S'\n\n            But wait, the actions in the path are for turns 11 to t-1. The total number of actions in the path is (t-11). Then we add one more for turn t, so total actions = t-10.\n\n            The turns for the actions: 11,12,...,t.\n\n          Example: if we reach (11,9) -> then path is empty (because we haven't taken any action) -> then we add an action for turn 11. But we start at (11,0), so we cannot be at (11,9).\n\n          So in practice, t>=11.\n\n          Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n            Let min_time = array of size 10 with inf, min_time[0]=11.\n            Let Q = deque([(11,0, [])])   # (t, y, path) where path is list of actions from turn 11 to turn t-1.\n\n            while Q:\n                (t, y, path) = Q.popleft()\n                if y == 9:\n                    # We are at turn t and y=9.\n                    # Then we need to output the actions: \n                    #   for turn 11 to t-1: the path\n                    #   for turn t: any action, say 'S'\n                    #   so the total sequence is path + ['S'] and H = len(path)+1 = (number of actions in path) + 1 = (t-11) + 1 = t-10.\n                    #   and the turns: from 11 to t.\n                    #   and the last turn we are at 9 is turn t (at the beginning) and then we take action 'S' at turn t.\n                    #   This satisfies the requirement.\n                    #   We output the actions for turns 11 to t.\n\n                    # But note: the problem says the sequence is for turns 11 to 11+H-1. \n                    #   Here, H = t-10, and the last turn in the sequence is 11+H-1 = 11 + (t-10) - 1 = t.\n                    #   So the actions are for turns 11 to t, which is what we have: path for 11 to t-1 and then 'S' for turn t.\n\n                    #   But the path only has actions for 11 to t-1, so we need to add the last action for turn t.\n\n                    actions = path + ['S']   # total actions: t-10 actions.\n                    # But wait: the path has actions for turns 11 to t-1: that's (t-11) actions, then we add one for turn t: so total t-10 actions.\n\n                    Then we output:\n\n                         Turn 11: actions[0]\n                         Turn 12: actions[1]\n                         ...\n                         Turn t: actions[t-11]   # which is the last 'S'\n\n                    And then we break.\n\n                # If y in [1,8] and there is a collision at (t,y), skip.\n                if 1 <= y <= 8:\n                    if there is any car on freeway y that has 0 in its span at turn t:\n                        continue   # skip this state\n                # Otherwise, expand to next states by actions.\n                for a in ['U','D','S']:\n                    if a=='U':\n                        y_next = y+1\n                        if y_next > 9: \n                            y_next = 9\n                    elif a=='D':\n                        y_next = y-1\n                        if y_next < 0:\n                            y_next = 0\n                    else: # 'S'\n                        y_next = y\n\n                    # next state (t+1, y_next)\n                    # Check if we have seen (t+1, y_next) at an earlier time? \n                    if min_time[y_next] > t+1:\n                        min_time[y_next] = t+1\n                        new_path = path + [a]   # because at turn t, we take action a to go to (t+1, y_next)\n                        Q.append((t+1, y_next, new_path))\n\n            If we empty the queue without finding, then no solution? but there should be one.\n\n          But note: we might get to the same (t+1,y_next) by a different path at the same time? But we are using BFS and we only keep the first time we get to (t+1,y_next).\n\n          However, we are not checking for revisited states at the same time? But we are storing min_time for y_next, and we update only if we get a smaller t. And we are processing in increasing t, so the first time we get to a state (t,y) is the minimal t.\n\n          But note: we might have multiple ways to get to (t+1,y_next) and we only keep the first one. That is fine for minimal time.\n\n          Now, we need to implement the collision check for freeway y at turn t.\n\n          For a given freeway y and turn t (>=11), we have a list of cars on that freeway.\n\n          For each car on freeway y, we have (head, tail, direction, speed) at turn 11.\n\n          Then at turn t, the car's span is:\n\n             if direction is 'right':\n                 span = [ tail + speed*(t-11), head + speed*(t-11) ]\n             if direction is 'left':\n                 span = [ head - speed*(t-11), tail - speed*(t-11) ]\n\n          Then we check if 0 is in the interval [min, max] of the span.\n\n          But note: for a right-moving car, the span is [τ + s*(t-11), h + s*(t-11)] -> and since τ<=h, the span is [τ + s*(t-11), h + s*(t-11)].\n          For a left-moving car, the span is [h - s*(t-11), τ - s*(t-11)] -> and since h<=τ, the span is [h - s*(t-11), τ - s*(t-11)].\n\n          We need to check if 0 is in [A, B] for a car, meaning A<=0<=B.\n\n          However, note: the representation for left-moving: head and tail at t1: head=12, tail=47 -> then the span at t is [12 - 36*(t-11), 47 - 36*(t-11)]. And since 12<47, the span is increasing.\n\n          Similarly for right-moving: tail and head at t1: for freeway1: tail=-47, head=0 -> then at turn t: [-47+48*(t-11), 0+48*(t-11)].\n\n          So the span is always [low, high] with low<=high.\n\n          Therefore, for a car, we compute:\n             if direction == 'right':\n                 low = tail + speed*(t-11)\n                 high = head + speed*(t-11)\n             else: # 'left'\n                 low = head - speed*(t-11)\n                 high = tail - speed*(t-11)\n\n          Then if low <= 0 <= high, then collision.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\".\n\n          Therefore, if any car on freeway y has its span containing 0, then there is a collision.\n\n          We are given the cars per freeway at turn 11.\n\n          Freeways: 1 to 8.\n\n          The given data:\n\n            Freeway 1: only one car: (head=0, tail=-47, direction='right', speed=48)\n                at turn t: \n                    low = -47 + 48*(t-11)\n                    high = 0 + 48*(t-11)\n                Check if 0 is in [ -47+48*(t-11), 48*(t-11) ]\n\n                This is always true? because 48*(t-11) is the high and -47+48*(t-11) <= 48*(t-11). And 0 is in between if:\n                    -47+48*(t-11) <= 0 <= 48*(t-11)\n                -> 48*(t-11) >= 0 -> always true for t>=11.\n                and -47+48*(t-11) <= 0  => 48*(t-11) <= 47 -> t-11 <= 47/48 < 1 -> t-11=0 -> t=11.\n\n                So only at t=11: the interval is [-47,0] -> 0 is included? yes, because high=0.\n                At t=12: low = -47+48 = 1, high=48 -> 0 not in [1,48] -> safe.\n\n            Freeway 2: two cars: \n                car1: (60,49,right,12) -> [49+12*(t-11), 60+12*(t-11)]\n                car2: (12,1,right,12) -> [1+12*(t-11), 12+12*(t-11)]\n\n                For car1: \n                    0 in [49+12*(t-11), 60+12*(t-11)] \n                    -> 49+12*(t-11) <= 0 <= 60+12*(t-11) \n                    The left part: 49+12*(t-11) <=0 -> 12*(t-11) <= -49 -> impossible for t>=11.\n\n                For car2: \n                    1+12*(t-11) <= 0 <= 12+12*(t-11)\n                    -> 12*(t-11) >= -1 and 12*(t-11) >= -12? \n                    but 0 in [1+12*(t-11), 12+12*(t-11)] \n                    requires 1+12*(t-11) <= 0 and 0<=12+12*(t-11)\n                    The second is always true for t>=11.\n                    The first: 1+12*(t-11) <=0 -> 12*(t-11)<=-1 -> t-11<=-1/12 -> impossible.\n\n                So freeway 2 is always safe.\n\n            Freeway 3: same as 2.\n\n            Freeway 4: (12,47,left,36) -> \n                low = 12 - 36*(t-11)\n                high = 47 - 36*(t-11)\n                Check: 12-36*(t-11) <= 0 <= 47-36*(t-11)\n                => 0 <= 47-36*(t-11)  -> 36*(t-11) <=47 -> t-11 <= 47/36 = 1.305 -> t-11=0 or 1.\n                and 12-36*(t-11) <=0 -> 36*(t-11)>=12 -> t-11>=12/36=1/3 -> so for t-11>=1, this is true.\n\n                At t=11: \n                   [12,47] -> 0 not in [12,47] -> safe.\n                At t=12:\n                   [12-36, 47-36] = [-24, 11] -> 0 in [-24,11] -> collision.\n\n                At t=13:\n                   [12-72,47-72] = [-60,-25] -> 0 not in.\n\n                So freeway 4 is unsafe only at t=12.\n\n            Freeway 5: same as 4.\n\n            Freeway 6: (-42,-53,right,6) -> \n                Note: for right-moving: [τ, h] = [-53, -42] -> \n                at turn t: \n                   low = -53 + 6*(t-11)\n                   high = -42 + 6*(t-11)\n                Check: -53+6*(t-11) <= 0 <= -42+6*(t-11)\n                -> 0<=-42+6*(t-11) -> 6*(t-11)>=42 -> t-11>=7.\n                and -53+6*(t-11)<=0 -> 6*(t-11)<=53 -> t-11<=53/6=8.83 -> so for t-11 in [7,8] \n                t=18: [ -53+6*7, -42+6*7] = [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? yes, at the high.\n                t=19: [ -53+48, -42+48] = [-5,6] -> 0 is included.\n\n                Actually, at t=18: high=0 -> included.\n                at t=19: -5<=0<=6 -> included.\n\n                t=20: [ -53+54, -42+54] = [1,12] -> not included.\n\n                So freeway 6: unsafe at t=18 and t=19.\n\n            Freeway 7: two cars:\n                car1: (52,41,right,4) -> [41+4*(t-11), 52+4*(t-11)]\n                car2: (4,-7,right,4) -> [-7+4*(t-11), 4+4*(t-11)]\n\n                car1: \n                   41+4*(t-11)<=0<=52+4*(t-11) -> \n                   left: 41+4*(t-11)<=0 -> 4*(t-11)<=-41 -> impossible.\n\n                car2:\n                   -7+4*(t-11) <=0<=4+4*(t-11)\n                   The right part: 0<=4+4*(t-11) -> always true for t>=11.\n                   left: -7+4*(t-11)<=0 -> 4*(t-11)<=7 -> t-11<=7/4=1.75 -> so t=11,12.\n                   t=11: [-7,4] -> 0 in the interval -> collision.\n                   t=12: [-7+4,4+4] = [-3,8] -> 0 in -> collision.\n                   t=13: [1,8] -> not.\n\n                So freeway 7: unsafe at t=11,12.\n\n            Freeway 8: (-45,-56,right,3) -> \n                [ -56+3*(t-11), -45+3*(t-11) ]\n                Check: -56+3*(t-11)<=0<=-45+3*(t-11)\n                -> 0<=-45+3*(t-11) -> 3*(t-11)>=45 -> t-11>=15.\n                and -56+3*(t-11)<=0 -> 3*(t-11)<=56 -> t-11<=56/3=18.66 -> so for t-11 in [15,18]\n                t=26: [ -56+3*15, -45+3*15] = [-56+45, -45+45] = [-11,0] -> 0 included? yes.\n                t=27: [-56+48, -45+48] = [-8,3] -> included.\n                t=28: [-56+51, -45+51] = [-5,6] -> included.\n                t=29: [-56+54, -45+54] = [-2,9] -> included.\n                t=30: [1,12] -> not.\n\n                So freeway 8: unsafe at t=26,27,28,29.\n\n          Now, we can simulate the BFS.\n\n          We start at (11,0) -> safe (y=0).\n\n          Then we can choose actions: U, D, S.\n\n          But we want to go up, so U is the natural choice.\n\n          Let's try to go up as fast as possible:\n\n             turn11: start at (11,0) -> safe.\n             choose U -> then at turn12, we are at y=1.\n\n          At turn12, freeway1: we computed above: at t=12, freeway1: [ -47+48, 48] = [1,48] -> no 0 -> safe? \n             But wait, freeway1 is y=1.

Then at turn19 we are at 9.\n\n          But that is what we have, and then we are at 9 at turn19. \n\n          But the beginning of turn19: we are at 9. Then we take the action at turn19.\n\n          So in the BFS, we stop when we reach (19,9) at the beginning of turn19. Then we took actions from 11 to 18 (8 actions) and then we need to take one more action at turn19. So total actions: 9.\n\n          How do we get to (19,9)?\n\n          We must have been at (18,8) and then taken U at turn18 to get to (19,9).\n\n          But then in the BFS, we would have:\n\n             state (18,8) is popped. It is safe? freeway8 at turn18: \n                 freeway8: t=18, t-11=7 -> [ -56+3*7, -45+3*7] = [-56+21, -45+21] = [-35, -24] -> safe.\n             then we take U: new_state = (19,9)\n\n          Then at (19,9): we output.\n\n          So the actions are: \n             the path to (18,8) (which is 8 actions: turns11 to 18) and then at turn19 we take 'S'? \n             but wait, to get to (19,9) from (18,8), we took 'U'. So the action for turn18 is 'U' (which is the last action in the path for (18,8)), and then at turn19 we take an additional action (which we choose as 'S').\n\n          But the action at turn18 is already in the path.\n\n          Actually, in our BFS, the action we take at state (t,y) is to go to (t+1,y_next). The action is stored in the path when we generate the next state.\n\n          In the state (18,8), the path has the actions for turns11 to 17. Then when we expand to (19,9) by 'U', we append 'U' to the path, so the path for (19,9) has 9 actions: for turns11 to 18.\n\n          But we don't need an extra action for turn19? \n\n          Why not? \n\n          We are at (19,9) and we output the path as the actions for turns11 to 18. Then for turn19, we do not include an action? \n\n          But the problem requires a sequence of actions for turns 11 to 11+H-1 = 11+9-1=19. So we need 9 actions: turns11 to 19.\n\n          But our path for (19,9) has only 8 actions (turns11 to 18) because we took actions to get to (19,9) which is at the beginning of turn19. \n\n          How to get to (19,9): we took actions at turns11 to 18 to be at (19,9) at the beginning of turn19. Then we haven't taken the action for turn19 yet.\n\n          Therefore, we need to take one more action at turn19. And then the state will be (20,9+delta(a)).\n\n          But the problem only requires to be at 9 at turn19. So we can take any action at turn19.\n\n          In our BFS, when we reach (19,9), we output the actions in the path (for turns11 to 18) and then we output one more action for turn19.\n\n          But our BFS does not generate that extra action. \n\n          Alternatively, we can consider the state (19,9) as the goal and then we output the path for turns11 to 18 and then an additional action for turn19.\n\n          In the BFS, when we find (19,9), we output the path for turns11 to 18 (which is 8 actions) and then we output an action for turn19 (e.g., 'S').\n\n          Then the total actions: 9.\n\n          Therefore, the sequence is:\n\n             Turn 11: U  (from the path)\n             Turn 12: U\n             Turn 13: U\n             Turn 14: U\n             Turn 15: U\n             Turn 16: U\n             Turn 17: U\n             Turn 18: U\n             Turn 19: S   (extra action)\n\n          But then the player at turn19 takes 'S' and stays at 9 at turn20. But the requirement is to be at 9 at turn19, and we are, and then we take 'S' at turn19.\n\n          This satisfies.\n\n          However, in the BFS, we can also choose to output the action for turn19 as 'U', but then we would go to 10? clamped to 9. Or 'D' to 8? but then we are not at 9 at turn20, but the goal is only for turn19.\n\n          So any action is valid for turn19.\n\n          We'll choose 'S' for simplicity.\n\n          But in the BFS, we don't generate the extra action. We only generate up to the state (19,9). Then we append 'S' for turn19.\n\n          Therefore, the code for the BFS: when we find a state (t,9), we output the path (actions for turns11 to t-1) and then one more action (e.g., 'S') for turn t.\n\n          Then the total number of actions is (t-11) + 1 = t-10.\n\n          For our example: t=19, then actions: 19-10 = 9 actions.\n\n          The actions are: the path (8 actions) for turns11 to 18, and then 'S' for turn19.\n\n          But note: to get to (19,9), we must have taken an action at turn18 that moved from 8 to 9. So the action at turn18 is 'U'. \n\n          How do we know the action at turn18? It is stored in the path.\n\n          So the BFS will have in the path for (19,9) the actions for turns11 to 18, including the 'U' at turn18.\n\n          Therefore, the full sequence is:\n\n             Turn11: first action in the path\n             ...\n             Turn18: last action in the path (which is 'U')\n             Turn19: 'S'\n\n          This is 9 actions.\n\n          Now, let's run the BFS for the given data.\n\n          We'll do a BFS in increasing t.\n\n          We start:\n\n             t=11, y=0, path=[].\n\n             Expand: \n                 actions: U, D, S.\n\n                 U: y_next = min(0+1,9)=1 -> state (12,1, ['U'])\n                 D: y_next = max(0-1,0)=0 -> state (12,0,['D'])\n                 S: y_next=0 -> state (12,0,['S'])\n\n             Then we mark min_time for y=1:12, y=0:12.\n\n          Then we pop (12,1,['U']):\n             freeway1: check at turn12: \n                 car: (0,-47,right,48) -> low = -47+48*(1)=1, high=0+48=48 -> [1,48] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n             then expand:\n                 U: y_next=2 -> (13,2,['U','U'])\n                 D: y_next=0 -> (13,0,['U','D'])\n                 S: y_next=1 -> (13,1,['U','S'])\n\n          Then we pop (12,0,['D']): \n             y=0 -> safe.\n             expand: same as above: next states (13,1), (13,0) (by U and S) and (13,0) by D? \n                 U: (13,1,['D','U'])\n                 D: (13,0,['D','D'])\n                 S: (13,0,['D','S'])\n\n          But we already have (13,0) and (13,1) with time13, and we haven't seen them before? \n             min_time[1]=inf, min_time[0]=inf? so we set min_time[1]=13, min_time[0]=13.\n\n          We continue. We are aiming for minimal time, so we try to move up.\n\n          We'll skip the details and follow the upward path.\n\n          We want to know if we can reach (19,9) in 8 moves (actions) and then one extra.\n\n          We need to reach (19,9). How many actions to get to (19,9)? 8 actions (from turn11 to turn18).\n\n          We must go from 0 to 9 in 8 moves? that means 8 ups: but 8 ups only get to y=8.\n\n          So we need 9 ups to get to 9, which would take 9 moves: \n             at turn11: start at0, after 9 moves (at turn20) we are at9.\n\n          But we want to be at9 at the beginning of turn19, which means after 8 moves we must be at9? that's impossible because 8 ups only get to8.\n\n          Therefore, we cannot be at9 at turn19 with only 8 moves.\n\n          We must be at9 at turn19: then the minimal turn is at least 20? \n\n          But let me see: \n             turn11: start at0\n             turn12: after 1 move:1\n             turn13:2\n             turn14:3\n             turn15:4\n             turn16:5\n             turn17:6\n             turn18:7\n             turn19:8   -> we are at8 at the beginning of turn19.\n             then we take U at turn19: then at turn20 we are at9.\n\n          Then we are at9 at turn20.\n\n          So then we output the actions for turns11 to 19 (9 actions) and then at turn20 we take 'S'. \n\n          But then we are at9 at turn20, so we output the path (9 actions) and then one more action for turn20.\n\n          Total actions: 10.\n\n          But is there a faster way? \n\n          We might wait or move down to avoid a collision and then move up.\n\n          In the upward path, we didn't hit any collision until freeway8 at turn19: \n             freeway8 at turn19: unsafe at t=26,27,28,29? and we are at turn19 which is not in that range.\n\n          So the upward path is safe.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\n          The sequence: \n             turn11: U\n             turn12: U\n             turn13: U\n             turn14: U\n             turn15: U\n             turn16: U\n             turn17: U\n             turn18: U\n             turn19: U\n             turn20: S\n\n          But wait, at turn19: we are at8 (beginning of turn19) and we take U to go to9 at turn20. \n          Then at turn20, we are at9. \n          Then we output for turn20: 'S'\n\n          But the actions are for turns11 to 20? that would be 10 actions: turns11,12,...,20.\n\n          And we are at9 at turn20, so the turn for which we are at9 is turn20 = 11+10-1 = 20 -> 11+H-1=20 -> H=10.\n\n          This matches.\n\n          However, is there a path with H<10?\n\n          We need to be at9 at turn11+H-1. For H=9: turn11+8=19. We need to be at9 at turn19.\n\n          To be at9 at turn19, we must have taken 9 actions of U. But we start at0, then after 9 ups we are at9. \n          The moves: \n             turn11: U ->12:1\n             turn12: U ->13:2\n             turn13: U ->14:3\n             turn14: U ->15:4\n             turn15: U ->16:5\n             turn16: U ->17:6\n             turn17: U ->18:7\n             turn18: U ->19:8  -> not 9.\n             turn19: we would take the 9th U to go to9 at turn20.\n\n          So we cannot be at9 at turn19.\n\n          Therefore, minimal H is 10.\n\n          But note: we might move faster by doing double moves? no, because we can only move one step at a time.\n\n          Alternatively, we might move down to avoid a collision, but in the upward path there is no collision, so we don't need to.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is 10 actions.\n\n          Let's verify the collisions along the upward path:\n\n             turn11: y=0 -> safe.\n             turn12: y=1 -> freeway1: [1,48] -> safe.\n             turn13: y=2 -> freeway2: safe.\n             turn14: y=3 -> freeway3: safe.\n             turn15: y=4 -> freeway4: [12-36*4, 47-36*4] = [-132,-97] -> safe.\n             turn16: y=5 -> freeway5: same as freeway4: safe.\n             turn17: y=6 -> freeway6: [-53+6*6, -42+6*6] = [-17,-6] -> safe.\n             turn18: y=7 -> freeway7: [41+4*7,52+4*7]=[69,80] and [-7+4*7,4+4*7]=[21,32] -> safe.\n             turn19: y=8 -> freeway8: [-56+3*8, -45+3*8]=[-32,-21] -> safe.\n             turn20: y=9 -> safe.\n\n          So it is safe.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\n          The actions: \n             turn11: U\n             turn12: U\n             turn13: U\n             turn14: U\n             turn15: U\n             turn16: U\n             turn17: U\n             turn18: U\n             turn19: U\n             turn20: S   (or any action, but 'S' is simplest)\n\n          But note: at turn20, we are at9, and then we take 'S'. The problem doesn't require to stay, but we must provide exactly 10 actions.\n\n          However, is there a path that reaches 9 at an earlier turn? \n\n          We can try to see if we can be at9 at turn19 by moving faster? not possible.\n\n          Or at turn18? then we would need to be at9 at turn18, which requires 8 actions of U from 0 to8, then at turn18 we are at8, and then we need to be at9 at turn18? impossible.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal is 10.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". And we have H=10.\n\n          However, let me see if we can avoid the last action? \n\n          The problem requires a sequence of actions for turns 11 to 11+H-1. And we are at9 at turn11+H-1.\n\n          In our solution, we are at9 at turn20 = 11+10-1 = 20. So it works.\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n            Turn 11: U\n            Turn 12: U\n            Turn 13: U\n            Turn 14: U\n            Turn 15: U\n            Turn 16: U\n            Turn 17: U\n            Turn 18: U\n            Turn 19: U\n            Turn 20: S\n\n          But wait, the last action is at turn20, which is the 10th action.\n\n          However, the state (20,9) is reached by the action at turn19: U. Then the action at turn20 is an extra action.\n\n          But note: in the BFS, the state (20,9) is reached by the path that has actions for turns11 to19. Then we output that path and then one more action for turn20.\n\n          But the problem only requires to be at9 at turn20 (which is 11+10-1=20). Then we are at9 at turn20, and then we take an action at turn20? and then we are at10 or8 or9 at turn21, but we don't care.\n\n          So it is valid.\n\n          Alternatively, we can output without the extra action? \n\n          But the problem requires a sequence of H actions. And H=10, so we need 10 actions.\n\n          In our solution, the 10 actions are for turns11 to20.\n\n          Therefore, we output 10 actions.\n\n          But note: the action at turn20 is taken while we are at9 at the beginning of turn20. Then after that action, we move.\n\n          This is acceptable.\n\n          However, is there a path that reaches (0,9) at turn19 (which would be 11+9-1=19) with 9 actions? we saw not.\n\n          So we output the above.\n\n          But let me double-check with freeway conditions that we might have missed a shorter path.\n\n          For example, if we try to go faster by not moving sometimes? that would not help.\n\n          Or if we move down to avoid a collision and then up, but in this upward path there are no collisions, so it is safe.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: S\n}\n\n          But wait, at turn19: we are at8 (beginning) and we take U, then at turn20 we are at9.\n          Then at turn20, we are at9 (beginning) and we take S, then at turn21 we are at9.\n\n          But the problem only requires to be at9 at turn20 (11+10-1=20) and we are.\n\n          However, note that at turn20, we are at9, and then we take action S, which is safe.\n\n          But is there a constraint that we must remain at9? no.\n\n          Therefore, this is valid.\n\n          We'll output the sequence.\n\n          But note: we could avoid the extra action by being at9 at turn19? we can't.\n\n          Or we could output only the actions that get us to9 at turn20, and then we don't need the extra action? \n\n          But the problem requires exactly H actions. In this case, we have 10 actions.\n\n          And to be at9 at turn20, we must take an action at turn20? but the problem says the sequence is from turn11 to turn20 (inclusive) for H=10.\n\n          And the last action (at turn20) can be any action.\n\n          So we must include an action for turn20.\n\n          Therefore, the above is correct.\n\n          However, note that at turn20, after taking 'S', we are still at9. So it is a no-op.\n\n          We could choose 'U' and then clamp to9, or 'D' and then go to8, but 'S' is simplest.\n\n          So we output.\n\n          But note: the freeway at turn20: we only check if we are on freeway1..8. At y=9, no freeway, so no check.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) is 10. The sequence of actions from turn 11 to turn 20 is as follows:\n\n- At turn 11, the player is at \\((0, 0)\\). Moving up (U) to \\((0, 1)\\) at turn 12 is safe, as freeway 1 at turn 12 has cars at \\([1, 48]\\), and 0 is not in this interval.\n- At turn 12, moving up (U) to \\((0, 2)\\) at turn 13 is safe, as freeway 2 is always safe.\n- At turn 13, moving up (U) to \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 14 is safe, as freeway 3 is always safe.\n- At turn 14, moving up (U) to \\((0, 4)\\) at turn 15 is safe, as freeway 4 at turn 15 has cars at \\([-132, -97]\\), and 0 is not in this interval.\n- At turn 15, moving up (U) to \\((0, 5)\\) at turn 16 is safe, as freeway 5 is identical to freeway 4 and safe.\n- At turn 16, moving up (U) to \\((0, 6)\\) at turn 17 is safe, as freeway 6 at turn 17 has cars at \\([-17, -6]\\), and 0 is not in this interval.\n- At turn 17, moving up (U) to \\((0, 7)\\) at turn 18 is safe, as freeway 7 at turn 18 has cars at \\([69, 80]\\) and \\([21, 32]\\), and 0 is not in these intervals.\n- At turn 18, moving up (U) to \\((0, 8)\\) at turn 19 is safe, as freeway 8 at turn 19 has cars at \\([-32, -21]\\), and 0 is not in this interval.\n- At turn 19, moving up (U) to \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 20 is safe, as \\(y = 9\\) has no cars.\n- At turn 20, the player is at \\((0, 9)\\). The action stay (S) is taken to satisfy the sequence length \\(H = 10\\), though any action is valid since the goal is already achieved at turn 20.\n\nThe sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 20 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 11 + 10 - 1 = 20\\)) without collisions on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 11:  \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12:  \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13:  \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14:  \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15:  \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16:  \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 17:  \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 18:  \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 19:  \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 20:  \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\begin{array}{c}\nU \\\\\nU \\\\\nU \\\\\nU \\\\\nU \\\\\nU \\\\\nU \\\\\nU \\\\\nU \\\\\nS \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 2) on turn t_1 = 13. I need to get to (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player moves vertically: U for up (y increases by 1), D for down (y decreases by 1), S for stay (y unchanged). y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars move horizontally on their respective freeways. For each car, given its head, tail, direction, and speed at turn t_1, I can find its position at any future turn T.\n\nCollision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y (between 1 and 8), and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 (the x-coordinate where the player is) is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nImportant note: When moving to a new y, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you check for collision on that row at that turn. If you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1, so you don't check y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars there. So once I'm at y=9, I'm safe.\n\nI need the minimal H such that after H turns, I'm at y=9, starting from y=2 at turn 13.\n\nSince y=9 is the target, and I start at y=2, I need to move up 7 units, so minimum H would be 7 if I could go straight up with no cars. But there are cars, so I might need to wait or detour, but since I can only move up, down, or stay, and down might not help because I need to go up, probably I should mostly go up, but might need to avoid collisions by staying or even going down temporarily.\n\nBut going down might increase H, so it should be minimized. Probably, staying is better than going down if I need to avoid something.\n\nNow, let's list the car states at turn t_1=13 for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=96, tail=49, direction=right, speed=48)\n\nSince direction is right, for right-moving cars, span at T is [tail + s*(T-t_1), head + s*(T-t_1)]? Let me check the update rule.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\nRight-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For freeway 1, it's (96, 49, right, 48). But in the span notation, for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"head h, tail τ\", so for freeway 1: head=96, tail=49, direction=right.\n\nSo at t_1, span is [τ, h] = [49, 96] for right-moving? No.\n\nThe problem says: for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], which is [tail, head].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ]? Let's see.\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car state, head and tail are given, but for direction, it might imply the order.\n\nFor freeway 1: direction right, so at t_1, span is [tail, head] = [49, 96]\n\nThen at turn T, Span(T) = [49 + 48*(T-13), 96 + 48*(T-13)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T, and 0 is in Span(T) for some car on that freeway.\n\nPlayer is on y_T at turn T.\n\nI need to find for each future turn, for each freeway, if there is a car covering x=0.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, and cars move horizontally, I can precompute for each freeway and each turn whether x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nBut turns are infinite, but since I need minimal H, and cars move at constant speed, I can find when they cover x=0.\n\nFor each car, I can find the times when it covers x=0.\n\nThen for each freeway, I can find the set of turns where it's unsafe (collision possible).\n\nThen I need to move from y=2 to y=9 through the freeways without being on an unsafe freeway at an unsafe turn.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so they are always safe.\n\ny=0 is safe, y=9 is safe, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,2) at turn 13, so at turn 13, player is on y=2, and I need to check if it's safe at turn 13.\n\nI should compute for each freeway, for each turn T >= t_1, whether x=0 is covered.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: dir right, tail=49, head=96, speed=48\n\nAt T, span: [49 + 48*(T-13), 96 + 48*(T-13)]\n\nx=0 is covered if 49 + 48*(T-13) <= 0 <= 96 + 48*(T-13)\n\nSince the car is moving right, the left end is increasing.\n\nSet L(T) = 49 + 48*(T-13)\n\nH(T) = 96 + 48*(T-13)\n\n0 in [L(T), H(T)] iff L(T) <= 0 <= H(T)\n\nL(T) <= 0: 49 + 48*(T-13) <= 0 => 48*(T-13) <= -49 => T-13 <= -49/48 ≈ -1.0208, so T-13 <= -2? Since T integer, T-13 <= -2? Let's compute.\n\n48*(T-13) <= -49\n\nSince 48 > 0, T-13 <= floor(-49/48) = floor(-1.0208) = -2? No, floor is for integers, but inequality.\n\nT-13 <= -49/48 ≈ -1.0208, so since T integer, T-13 <= -2? Let's see:\n\nIf T-13 = -2, L = 49 + 48*(-2) = 49 - 96 = -47, which is <=0\n\nH = 96 - 96 =0, so [ -47, 0], so 0 is included if the interval is inclusive. Problem says \"0 in Span(T)\", and span is [low, high], I assume inclusive.\n\nAt T-13 = -2, T=11, L=49 +48*(-2)=49-96=-47, H=96-96=0, so [ -47, 0], so 0 is included.\n\nBut T=11 is before t_1=13, so for T>=13, T-13 >=0.\n\nL(T) = 49 +48*(T-13)\n\nFor T>=13, T-13>=0, L(T) >=49 >0, so L(T) >0 for all T>=13.\n\nThus for T>=13, L(T) >=49 >0, so 0 < L(T) <= H(T), so 0 not in [L(T), H(T)] since L(T)>0.\n\nSimilarly, H(T) =96 +48*(T-13) >0 always for T>=13.\n\nSo for freeway 1, for all T>=13, x=0 is not covered, so safe.\n\nL(T) min for T=13 is 49 >0, and increasing, so yes, always positive, so 0 never covered for T>=13. So freeway 1 is always safe for T>=13.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36, -47, right, 12) head=-36, tail=-47, dir=right\n\nFor right-moving, span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt T: [ -47 + 12*(T-13), -36 + 12*(T-13) ]\n\nSecond car: (36, 25, right, 12) head=36, tail=25, dir=right\n\nSpan at t_1: [25, 36]\n\nAt T: [25 + 12*(T-13), 36 + 12*(T-13)]\n\nNow, x=0 covered by first car if -47 +12*(T-13) <= 0 <= -36 +12*(T-13)\n\nSimilarly for second car: 25 +12*(T-13) <= 0 <= 36 +12*(T-13)\n\nFirst, for first car:\n\nL1(T) = -47 +12*(T-13)\n\nH1(T) = -36 +12*(T-13)\n\n0 in [L1, H1] iff L1 <=0 and H1 >=0\n\nL1 <=0: -47 +12*(T-13) <=0 => 12*(T-13) <=47 => T-13 <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so T-13 <=3 since T integer.\n\nH1 >=0: -36 +12*(T-13) >=0 => 12*(T-13) >=36 => T-13 >=3\n\nSo L1 <=0 and H1 >=0 iff T-13 >=3 and T-13 <=3? From above:\n\nT-13 <=3 for L1<=0, and T-13 >=3 for H1>=0.\n\nSo T-13 =3.\n\nAt T-13=3, L1= -47 +12*3 = -47+36= -11 <=0, H1= -36+36=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nFor other T, not both true.\n\nSimilarly, for second car:\n\nL2(T) =25 +12*(T-13)\n\nH2(T) =36 +12*(T-13)\n\nL2 <=0: 25 +12*(T-13) <=0 => 12*(T-13) <= -25 => T-13 <= -25/12 ≈ -2.083, so T-13 <= -3? Since integer.\n\nT-13 <= -3, L2=25+12*(-3)=25-36=-11<=0, H2=36-36=0, but T=10, before t_1.\n\nFor T>=13, L2(T) >=25 +12*0=25>0, so always L2>0, H2>0, so 0 not in [L2,H2] for T>=13.\n\nThus for freeway 2, unsafe only when T-13=3, i.e., T=16.\n\nAt T=16, first car covers x=0.\n\nOtherwise safe for T>=13 except T=16.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Cars: (-36, -47, right, 12) and (36, 25, right, 12)\n\nIdentical to freeway 2, so same: unsafe only at T=16.\n\nFreeway 4: one car: (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nDirection left.\n\nFor left-moving, span at t_1: [h, τ] = [-60, -25]? Head=-60, tail=-25, dir=left.\n\nProblem says for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\n\nThen Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\n\nSo here h=-60, τ=-25, s=36\n\nAt T: [ -60 -36*(T-13), -25 -36*(T-13) ]\n\nx=0 covered if L(T) <=0 <= H(T), with L(T) = -60 -36*(T-13), H(T) = -25 -36*(T-13)\n\nSince left-moving, L(T) decreasing, H(T) decreasing.\n\n0 in [L,H] iff L <=0 and H >=0\n\nL <=0: -60 -36*(T-13) <=0 => -36*(T-13) <=60 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality: 36*(T-13) >= -60? Let's see:\n\n-60 -36*(T-13) <=0 => -36*(T-13) <=60\n\nDivide by -36, reverse inequality: T-13 >= 60 / (-36) * (-1)? Better:\n\n-36*(T-13) <= 60\n\nDivide both sides by -36, reverse inequality:\n\nT-13 >= 60 / (-36) ? No:\n\nA <= B, multiply by negative: reverse.\n\nSo -36*(T-13) <= 60\n\nDivide both sides by -36, reverse: T-13 >= 60 / (-36) = -60/36 = -5/3 ≈ -1.666\n\nSince T integer, T-13 >= -1, because -1.666, ceil to -1? T-13 >= ceil(-1.666) = -1? Let's see inequality.\n\nT-13 >= -60/36 = -5/3 ≈ -1.666\n\nSince T integer, T-13 >= -1\n\nSimilarly, H >=0: -25 -36*(T-13) >=0 => -36*(T-13) >=25 => multiply by -1, reverse: 36*(T-13) <= -25 => T-13 <= -25/36 ≈ -0.694, so T-13 <= -1\n\nNow, L <=0 requires T-13 >= -1.666, so T-13 >= -1\n\nH >=0 requires T-13 <= -0.694, so T-13 <= -1\n\nThus both: T-13 >= -1 and T-13 <= -1, so T-13 = -1\n\nAt T=12, L= -60 -36*(-1) = -60 +36 = -24 <=0? T-13 = -1, T=12\n\nL(T) = -60 -36*(T-13) = -60 -36*(-1) = -60 +36 = -24 <=0\n\nH(T) = -25 -36*(-1) = -25 +36 =11 >=0\n\nSo span [ -24, 11], includes 0.\n\nFor T>=13, T-13 >=0, L(T) = -60 -36*(T-13) <= -60 <0, but H(T) = -25 -36*(T-13) <= -25 <0 for T-13>=0, so H<0, so 0 not in [L,H] since H<0.\n\nThus for T>=13, freeway 4 is always safe.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4? Cars: (-60, -25, left, 36) same, so always safe for T>=13.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nHead=-30, tail=-41, dir=right\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [-41, -30]\n\nAt T: [ -41 +6*(T-13), -30 +6*(T-13) ]\n\nx=0 covered if L <=0 <= H, L= -41 +6*(T-13), H= -30 +6*(T-13)\n\nL <=0: -41 +6*(T-13) <=0 => 6*(T-13) <=41 => T-13 <= 41/6 ≈6.833, so T-13 <=6\n\nH >=0: -30 +6*(T-13) >=0 => 6*(T-13) >=30 => T-13 >=5\n\nThus both iff T-13 >=5 and T-13 <=6\n\nAt T-13=5: L= -41 +30= -11<=0, H= -30+30=0, [ -11,0]\n\nAt T-13=6: L= -41+36= -5<=0, H= -30+36=6>=0, [ -5,6]\n\nSo unsafe at T=13+5=18 and T=13+6=19? T-13=5: T=18, T-13=6: T=19\n\nT-13 >=5 and <=6, so T=18 and T=19.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (60,49,right,4) and (12,1,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head=60, tail=49, dir=right, span at t_1: [49,60]\n\nAt T: [49 +4*(T-13), 60 +4*(T-13)]\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4) head=12, tail=1, span [1,12]\n\nAt T: [1 +4*(T-13), 12 +4*(T-13)]\n\nFor first car: 0 in [49+4d, 60+4d] where d=T-13\n\n49+4d <=0 <=60+4d? 49+4d <=0 => 4d <= -49 => d <= -12.25, so d<=-13? For d>=0, 49+4d>=49>0, so never <=0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly, H=60+4d>0.\n\nFor second car: 0 in [1+4d, 12+4d]\n\n1+4d <=0 <=12+4d\n\n1+4d <=0 => 4d <= -1 => d <= -0.25, so d<= -1\n\nFor d>=0, 1+4d >=1>0, so never <=0, thus 0 not covered.\n\nThus freeway 7 always safe for T>=13.\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (-39,-50,right,3)\n\nHead=-39, tail=-50, dir=right\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ,h] = [-50,-39]\n\nAt T: [ -50 +3*(T-13), -39 +3*(T-13) ]\n\nx=0 covered if L<=0<=H, L= -50 +3d, H= -39 +3d, d=T-13\n\nL<=0: -50+3d<=0 => 3d<=50 => d<=50/3≈16.666, d<=16\n\nH>=0: -39+3d>=0 => 3d>=39 => d>=13\n\nSo both iff d>=13 and d<=16\n\nThus T=13+13=26 to T=13+16=29? d from 13 to 16 inclusive.\n\nd=T-13, so d=13: T=26, d=14: T=27, d=15: T=28, d=16: T=29\n\nUnsafe turns: 26,27,28,29\n\nNow, summarize unsafe turns for each freeway:\n\ny=1: always safe (as earlier)\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=16\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=16\n\ny=4: always safe\n\ny=5: always safe\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=18,19\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=26,27,28,29\n\ny=0 and y=9: always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at turn 13.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=2 at turn 13, I need to move up to y=9.\n\nPossible paths: I can go directly up, but need to avoid unsafe times.\n\nAt turn 13, player is on y=2.\n\nIs y=2 safe at turn 13? From above, y=2 unsafe only at T=16, so at T=13, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 unsafe only at T=16, etc.\n\nNow, minimal H: since I need to go from y=2 to y=9, which is 7 steps up, but I might need to stay or go down to avoid collisions, which would increase turns.\n\nSo ideally, H=7 if I can go up every turn.\n\nBut let's see if possible.\n\nStart at turn 13, y=2.\n\nTurn 13: at y=2, safe as per above.\n\nI need to choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go U, to y=3 at turn 14.\n\nTurn 14: player at y=3.\n\nIs y=3 safe at turn 14? y=3 unsafe only at T=16, so T=14 safe.\n\nThen I can go U to y=4 at turn 15.\n\nTurn 15: y=4, which is always safe, so safe.\n\nGo U to y=5 at turn 16.\n\nNow turn 16: if I go to y=5, but at turn 16, I am on y=5 only if I arrived there at turn 16.\n\nLet's track the position at each turn.\n\nAt turn T, player is at y_T.\n\nAction at turn T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nStart: turn 13, y=2.\n\nAfter action at turn 13, y_{14} is set.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo at turn 13: I choose a_{13}, which sets y_{14} = y_{13} + Δy, with Δy based on action.\n\ny_{13} = 2.\n\nSuppose I choose U: then y_{14} = 3.\n\nAt turn 14, I am at y=3.\n\nNow, is it safe? y=3 at turn 14: unsafe only at T=16, so safe.\n\nChoose U: y_{15} = 4.\n\nTurn 15: at y=4, always safe.\n\nChoose U: y_{16} = 5.\n\nTurn 16: at y=5.\n\ny=5 is always safe, as per earlier.\n\nBut at turn 16, y=2 and y=3 are unsafe, but I am at y=5, which is fine.\n\nThen I can continue: choose U to y=6 at turn 17.\n\nTurn 17: at y=6.\n\ny=6 unsafe at T=18 and 19, not 17, so safe.\n\nChoose U to y=7 at turn 18.\n\nTurn 18: at y=7.\n\ny=7 is always safe, so safe.\n\nBut at turn 18, y=6 is unsafe, but I am at y=7, so no issue.\n\nChoose U to y=8 at turn 19.\n\nTurn 19: at y=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=26-29, not 19, so safe? T=19, y=8 unsafe only from 26-29, so safe at 19.\n\nThen choose U to y=9 at turn 20.\n\nTurn 20: at y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, let's count the turns.\n\nStart turn 13, y=2.\n\nAfter actions:\n\nTurn 13: action U, to y=3 at turn 14\n\nTurn 14: at y=3, action U, to y=4 at turn 15\n\nTurn 15: at y=4, action U, to y=5 at turn 16\n\nTurn 16: at y=5, action U, to y=6 at turn 17\n\nTurn 17: at y=6, action U, to y=7 at turn 18\n\nTurn 18: at y=7, action U, to y=8 at turn 19\n\nTurn 19: at y=8, action U, to y=9 at turn 20\n\nAt turn 20, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 13 to turn 19, that's 7 actions? Turns: I take actions at turn 13,14,15,16,17,18,19 to reach y=9 at turn 20.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think H actions to reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nStart at turn t_1=13, after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, after 7 actions: actions at t=13 to t=19, y at t=20 is 9.\n\nt_1 + H =20, t_1=13, so H=7.\n\nAnd I reached without any collision, as per above.\n\nBut let me confirm the unsafe points.\n\nAt turn 16, I was at y=5, which is safe.\n\nAt turn 18, I was at y=7, safe.\n\nAt turn 19, I was at y=8, which is safe since unsafe only later.\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=26-29, not 19.\n\nAnd I arrived at y=9 at turn 20.\n\nIs there any issue?\n\nIn the sequence, when I was at y=6 at turn 17, it was safe, since unsafe only at 18 and 19.\n\nAt turn 18, I moved to y=7, so at turn 18, I am on y=7, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 19, I am on y=8.\n\nNo problem.\n\nBut is H minimal? 7 is the minimum since I need 7 up moves.\n\nI could have stayed or gone down, but that would take more turns, so H=7 should be achievable.\n\nBut let me double-check if at any point I might be unsafe.\n\nPerhaps I should list the position at each turn.\n\nTurn 13: y=2, safe (since unsafe only at 16)\n\nTurn 14: y=3, safe (only unsafe at 16)\n\nTurn 15: y=4, safe\n\nTurn 16: y=5, safe\n\nTurn 17: y=6, safe (unsafe at 18,19)\n\nTurn 18: y=7, safe\n\nTurn 19: y=8, safe (unsafe later)\n\nTurn 20: y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nBut at turn 17, y=6 is safe, but at turn 18, if I were still on y=6, it would be unsafe, but I moved to y=7 at turn 18.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 19, I moved to y=8.\n\nNow, the car on y=6 is unsafe at turn 18 and 19, but I am not on y=6 at those turns.\n\nAt turn 18, I am on y=7, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIs there a problem with freeway 2 or 3 at turn 16?\n\nAt turn 16, y=2 and y=3 are unsafe, but I am at y=5, which is fine.\n\nSo this seems fine.\n\nBut in the action sequence, I need to output the actions from turn t_1 onwards.\n\nIn this case, all actions are U, since I went straight up.\n\nBut let me confirm if starting at turn 13 is safe.\n\nPlayer position at turn 13: (0,2), and freeway y=2.\n\nAt turn 13, for y=2, is there a car covering x=0?\n\nFrom earlier, for y=2, unsafe only at T=16, so at T=13, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should compute explicitly for T=13.\n\nFor example, freeway 2 at T=13: d=0\n\nFirst car: [ -47 +12*0, -36 +12*0] = [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\ny=6 at T=17: d=17-13=4\n\nCar: L= -41 +6*4 = -41+24= -17, H= -30+24= -6, so [-17,-6], 0 not in, since all negative.\n\nAt T=18: d=5, L= -41+30= -11, H= -30+30=0, [-11,0], includes 0, unsafe.\n\nBut at T=17, I am there, safe.\n\nThen I leave at turn 18 to y=7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, I can go straight up with 7 U actions.\n\nH=7, actions: U,U,U,U,U,U,U\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nt_1=13.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nAnd at turn 20, y=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have actions from turn 13 to 19, that's 7 actions.\n\nAfter last action at turn 19, y_{20}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut is there any reason I cannot do this?\n\nPerhaps at some point, if I stay, but here I don't need to.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, at the turn I move, I am on the current y, not the next.\n\nBut in this case, it seems fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if y=9 is reached earlier, but no, I need to go to y=9, which is row 9, not freeway, but in terms of position, (0,9).\n\nIn the move, if I go U from y=8, I reach y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 19 I am at y=8, action U, to y=9 at turn 20.\n\nCould I reach earlier? From y=2 to y=9, minimum 7 moves up, so no.\n\nIf I start at turn 13 y=2, after 6 U, I would be at y=8 at turn 19? Let's see:\n\nTurn 13: start y=2\n\nAfter action U at 13: y=3 at 14\n\nU at 14: y=4 at 15\n\nU at 15: y=5 at 16\n\nU at 16: y=6 at 17\n\nU at 17: y=7 at 18\n\nU at 18: y=8 at 19\n\nThen at turn 19, I am at y=8.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need another action at turn 19: U, to y=9 at turn 20.\n\nSo yes, 7 actions.\n\nIf I do nothing, I stay, but that increases H.\n\nSo minimal H=7.\n\nIn this case, it works.\n\nBut let me check freeway 8, but at turn 19 I am at y=8, which is safe since unsafe only at 26-29.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm the car positions.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 6, at turn 18, it is unsafe, but I am not there.\n\nBut just to be thorough.\n\nPerhaps I can output the sequence.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to list the actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case H=7.\n\nBut is there a constraint I missed?\n\nThe player position: at turn 13, (0,2)\n\nAfter actions, reaches (0,9) at turn 20.\n\nCollision avoided.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if at turn 16, when y=2 and y=3 are unsafe, but I am at y=5, fine.\n\nMaybe I could go slower, but no need.\n\nPerhaps if I go down at some point, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut in freeway 3, same as freeway 2, unsafe at 16, but I am not on it.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the sequence should be all U.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 13: U \\\\ Turn 14: U \\\\ Turn 15: U \\\\ Turn 16: U \\\\ Turn 17: U \\\\ Turn 18: U \\\\ Turn 19: U }\n\nH=7.\n\nBut in the box, I need to include the actions only, I think.\n\nThe format says: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nAnd H is implied by the number of actions.\n\nSince after H actions, you reach.\n\nIn the sequence, I have from turn 13 to 19, that's 6 actions? No.\n\nt from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, so actions at t=13 to t=13+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H.\n\nFor example, after 1 action at t_13, at turn 14, y_{14}.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H.\n\nSet to 9.\n\nIn this case, t_1 + H = 20, so H=7.\n\nActions at turn 13 to 19.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should specify H, but in the answer format, it's the sequence.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 7, I thought always safe, but let me double-check.\n\nFreeway 7: cars (60,49,right,4) and (12,1,right,4)\n\nAt T, for first car: [49+4d,60+4d], d>=0, min 49>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSecond car: [1+4d,12+4d], min 1>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 at early turns: unsafe only at 26-29.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is all U.\n\nBut just to be complete, suppose at some point I needed to avoid, but here not necessary.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Positions and Safe Turns\nThe safety of each freeway at each turn \\(T \\geq 13\\) was determined based on whether \\(x = 0\\) is covered by any car on that freeway. The key unsafe turns are:\n- Freeway 2: Unsafe at \\(T = 16\\)\n- Freeway 3: Unsafe at \\(T = 16\\)\n- Freeway 6: Unsafe at \\(T = 18\\) and \\(T = 19\\)\n- Freeway 8: Unsafe at \\(T = 26, 27, 28, 29\\)\nAll other freeways (1, 4, 5, 7) are safe for all \\(T \\geq 13\\), and \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) are always safe.\n\n### Path to Reach \\(y = 9\\)\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 2\\) is 7, as it requires exactly 7 upward moves (each increasing \\(y\\) by 1). The sequence of actions must avoid collisions:\n- At turn 13, start at \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as \\(y = 2\\) is only unsafe at \\(T = 16\\)).\n- Move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 14 (safe, as \\(y = 3\\) is only unsafe at \\(T = 16\\)).\n- Move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 15 (always safe).\n- Move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 16 (always safe; note \\(y = 2\\) and \\(y = 3\\) are unsafe at \\(T = 16\\), but the player is at \\(y = 5\\)).\n- Move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 17 (safe, as \\(y = 6\\) is unsafe only at \\(T = 18\\) and \\(19\\)).\n- Move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 18 (always safe; note \\(y = 6\\) is unsafe at \\(T = 18\\), but the player moves away).\n- Move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 19 (safe, as \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe only at \\(T = 26-29\\)).\n- Move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 20 (safe, as \\(y = 9\\) has no cars).\n\nThis path achieves the target in \\(H = 7\\) turns with no collisions. Any deviation (e.g., staying or moving down) would increase \\(H\\), so this is minimal.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 13\\) to \\(19\\) is all \"U\" (up), resulting in \\(y = 9\\) at turn 20.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 13: U \\\\ Turn 14: U \\\\ Turn 15: U \\\\ Turn 16: U \\\\ Turn 17: U \\\\ Turn 18: U \\\\ Turn 19: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,3) at turn t1=14 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: U for up (y+1), D for down (y-1), S for stay (y same). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I have its position at turn t1, direction, and speed. I need to check for collisions only when the player is on a freeway y at turn T, meaning if y_T = k for some k=1 to 8, then there must be no car on freeway k where 0 is in its span at that exact turn T.\n\nThe key point is that when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new freeway until the next turn. So, if at turn T, the player is on y_T, and they move to y_{T+1}, at turn T they are still on y_T, so collision check is only for y_T at turn T. When they arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, the collision check is for y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nAlso, cars move continuously; their positions are updated based on the time elapsed from t1.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as T_start = t1 = 14.\n\nPlayer starts at y = 3.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H should be at least the difference in y, which is 6, since from 3 to 9 is 6 steps up, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so it could be more than 6.\n\nBut I should aim for H=6 if possible, meaning all U actions.\n\nBut I have to avoid collisions on the freeways I step on.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to y=8, so when I'm on y=3, I need to check freeway 3 for cars that have 0 in their span at the turn I'm on it.\n\nSimilarly for other y's.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, y=9 is the top, where I need to go.\n\nIn the position, it's (0,y), so x=0 is the point where we check for cars, I think.\n\nThe collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on (0, y_T) and for the freeway k=y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nThe span is the interval where the car is, and 0 is the x-coordinate we care about.\n\nNow, cars are moving, so their positions change with time.\n\nI need to compute for each freeway and each car, the times when 0 is in their span.\n\nThen, for the player path, when they are on a freeway y at turn T, that time T must not be a time when for freeway y, 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, if any car has 0 in span at time T, collision.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars and their movements.\n\nFirst, time is measured from t1=14.\n\nSo, for any turn T, the time elapsed since t1 is Δt = T - t1.\n\nThen for each car, at time T, the span changes based on direction and speed.\n\nLet me define τ = T - t1, so at τ=0, it's turn t1.\n\nThen for a car, given head h, tail τ (I'll use t for tail to avoid confusion, but in the notation it's τ, but I'll call it tail.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor left-moving cars (d=left), span at τ is [h - s*τ, tail - s*τ]\n\nSince head and tail, for left-moving, if head is left of tail, I think.\n\nLet's see the notation.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, at t1, span is [tail, head], so head > tail.\n\nSimilarly for left, at t1, [head, tail], so head < tail? No.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nIn left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and h and τ, which is head and tail.\n\nBut in the example, for freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-95, -48]? τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the notation: for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" so [tail, head], so tail ≤ head.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" so [head, tail], so head ≤ tail? But that might not make sense if head and tail are positions.\n\nI think I need to interpret head and tail based on direction.\n\nTypically, for a car, head is the front, tail is the back.\n\nFor right-moving car, head is on the right, tail on left, so at position, head > tail, so span [tail, head].\n\nFor left-moving, head on left, tail on right, so head < tail, span [head, tail].\n\nIn the update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)] since moving left, both decrease.\n\nSince head < tail for left-moving, [h - s dt, τ - s dt]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ + s dt, h + s dt] since both increase.\n\nNow, collision if 0 is in the span at time T for the freeway.\n\n0 in [low, high] means low ≤ 0 ≤ high.\n\nNow, for each car, I can find when 0 is in its span.\n\nThen for each freeway, the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nBut multiple cars, so occupied if any car has 0 in span.\n\nThen for the player, when on freeway y at time T, it must not be occupied.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so at t1, span [τ, h] = [-95, -48]\n\nAt time T, span [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)] = [-95 + 48*(T-14), -48 + 48*(T-14)]\n\nSet dt = T - 14, so span: low = -95 + 48 dt, high = -48 + 48 dt\n\n0 in span if low ≤ 0 ≤ high\n\n-95 + 48 dt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 48 dt\n\nFirst inequality: -95 + 48 dt ≤ 0 => 48 dt ≤ 95 => dt ≤ 95/48 ≈ 1.979\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -48 + 48 dt => 48 dt ≥ 48 => dt ≥ 1\n\nSo 1 ≤ dt ≤ 1.979\n\nSince dt = T - 14, T integer, so T=15,16? dt=1: T=15, dt=2: T=16?

This car is always to the right, never at x=0. So no issue.\n\nThus for freeway 2, only the first car matters, occupied at T=16.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"3 | (-24, -35, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12)\"\n\nIdentical to freeway 2. So occupied at T=16, same as above.\n\nFreeway 4: one car: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so at t1, span [h, τ] = [48, 83]? For left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], so h=48, τ=83, so [48,83], which means head=48, tail=83, so tail > head, since moving left.\n\nAt T, Span(T) = [h - s dt, τ - s dt] = [48 - 36 dt, 83 - 36 dt]\n\n0 in span if 48 -36 dt ≤ 0 ≤ 83 -36 dt\n\nFirst inequality: 48 -36 dt ≤ 0 => -36 dt ≤ -48 => 36 dt ≥ 48 => dt ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 83 -36 dt => 36 dt ≤ 83 => dt ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSo 4/3 ≤ dt ≤ 83/36\n\ndt ≥ 1.333 and dt ≤ 2.305\n\nT integer, dt=2: T=16? dt=2: 48-72= -24, 83-72=11, so [-24,11], 0 in [-24,11] yes, -24≤0≤11.\n\ndt=1: T=15, 48-36=12, 83-36=47, [12,47], 12>0, 0 not ≤12? 0 <12, not in.\n\ndt=3: T=17, 48-108= -60, 83-108= -25, [-60,-25], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo occupied at T=16 only? dt=2, T=16.\n\ndt=2 is 1.333 to 2.305, so for dt=2, yes.\n\nBut dt=1 not, dt=3 not, so only T=16.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4? \"5 | (48, 83, left, 36)\" identical, so occupied at T=16.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (-24, -35, right, 6)\n\nDirection right, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nAt T, span [ -35 + 6 dt, -24 + 6 dt ]\n\n0 in span if -35 +6 dt ≤ 0 ≤ -24 +6 dt\n\nFirst: -35 +6 dt ≤ 0 => 6 dt ≤ 35 => dt ≤ 35/6 ≈ 5.833\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -24 +6 dt => 6 dt ≥ 24 => dt ≥ 4\n\nSo 4 ≤ dt ≤ 5.833\n\nT integer, dt=4: T=18, low= -35+24= -11, high= -24+24=0, so -11≤0≤0, yes.\n\ndt=5: T=19, low= -35+30= -5, high= -24+30=6, -5≤0≤6, yes.\n\ndt=6: T=20, low= -35+36=1, high= -24+36=12, 1 to 12, 0 not in.\n\ndt=3: T=17, low= -35+18= -17, high= -24+18= -6, both negative, not.\n\nSo occupied at T=18 and T=19.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nDirection right, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T, span [ -59 + 4 dt, -48 + 4 dt ]\n\n0 in span if -59 +4 dt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +4 dt\n\nFirst: -59 +4 dt ≤ 0 => 4 dt ≤ 59 => dt ≤ 59/4 = 14.75\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 +4 dt => 4 dt ≥ 48 => dt ≥ 12\n\nSo 12 ≤ dt ≤ 14.75\n\nT integer, dt=12: T=26, low= -59+48= -11, high= -48+48=0, -11≤0≤0, yes.\n\ndt=13: T=27, low= -59+52= -7, high= -48+52=4, -7≤0≤4, yes.\n\ndt=14: T=28, low= -59+56= -3, high= -48+56=8, -3≤0≤8, yes.\n\ndt=15: T=29, low= -59+60=1, high= -48+60=12, 1 to 12, 0 not in.\n\ndt=11: T=25, low= -59+44= -15, high= -48+44= -4, both negative, not.\n\nSo occupied at T=26,27,28.\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (16, 5, right, 4)\n\n(16, 5, right, 4), but for right-moving, span at t1 [τ, h], τ=5, h=16?

Is y=3 occupied at T=14? From above, for y=3, occupied only at T=16, not at T=14, so safe. Similarly, all freeways are safe at T=14 except possibly, but y=1 at T=15, etc., but T=14 is start, no issue.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nThe direct path: all U, from y=3 to y=9 in 6 steps: T=14 to T=19? Let's see the sequence.\n\nAt turn T, player moves to y_{T+1} based on action at T.\n\nDefine the turn and position.\n\nAt turn T, player is at position y_T, then chooses action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nThen, at turn T, collision check for (0, y_T) with freeway y_T.\n\nFor example, start T=14, y=3. As above, y=3 not occupied at T=14, safe.\n\nNow, if I go up each turn:\n\nAction at T=14: U, so y_{15} = 3+1=4\n\nAt T=14, we are on y=3, safe.\n\nThen turn T=15: player is at y=4. Now, check y=4 at T=15.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4? Freeways y=1 to 8, so y=4 is freeway 4.\n\nFrom above, freeway 4 occupied at T=16, not at T=15. At T=15, for y=4: earlier, freeway 4 occupied only at T=16, so at T=15, not occupied. Safe.\n\nThen action at T=15: U, y_{16}=4+1=5\n\nTurn T=16: player at y=5. Now y=5 at T=16.\n\nFreeway 5 occupied at T=16? Yes, from above. So collision if I am on y=5 at T=16.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf I go straight up:\n\nT=14: y=3, safe (not occ at T=14)\n\nT=15: y=4, freeway 4 not occ at T=15 (occ only at T=16)\n\nT=16: y=5, freeway 5 occ at T=16, collision.\n\nCannot be on y=5 at T=16.\n\nSimilarly, if I try to go to y=5 later or earlier.\n\nBut in direct path, at T=16 I would be on y=5, which is occupied.\n\nSo need to avoid that.\n\nPerhaps I can wait or go down.\n\nSince y=3 at T=14 is safe, I could stay at y=3 for some turns.\n\nBut y=3 will be occupied at T=16, so I need to leave before or after.\n\ny=3 occupied at T=16, so if I stay at y=3, at T=16 collision.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=3 at T=16.\n\nSimilarly for other y's.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be more than 6.\n\nLet me list the occupied times for each y:\n\ny=1: occ T=15\n\ny=2: occ T=16\n\ny=3: occ T=16\n\ny=4: occ T=16\n\ny=5: occ T=16\n\ny=6: occ T=18,19\n\ny=7: occ T=26,27,28\n\ny=8: occ T=26,27,28,29\n\nNow, player starts at T=14, y=3.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some T.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe path must avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nFor example, at T=16, y=2,3,4,5 are all occupied? y=2 occ T=16, y=3 occ T=16, y=4 occ T=16, y=5 occ T=16. So all of them occupied at T=16.\n\ny=1 occ only T=15, not T=16.\n\ny=6 occ later.\n\nAt T=16, freeways 2,3,4,5 are all occupied.\n\nSo if player is on any of y=2,3,4,5 at T=16, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at other times.\n\nNow, to go from y=3 to y=9, I need to cross these freeways.\n\nSince at T=16, all middle freeways are occupied, I should not be on any freeway from 1 to 8 at T=16? But y=1 is not occupied at T=16, only T=15.\n\ny=1 occupied only T=15, so at T=16, y=1 is free.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 not occupied at T=16.\n\ny=6 occ at 18,19, so at T=16, y=6 is free.\n\nBut at T=16, y=2,3,4,5 occupied.\n\nSo possible positions at T=16: y=0,1,6,7,8,9 are safe, but y=7,8 may be occupied later, but at T=16 not.\n\ny=7 occ at 26-28, so at T=16 free.\n\nSimilarly y=8 occ later.\n\nSo at T=16, safe y: 0,1,6,7,8,9.\n\nNow back to the player.\n\nAt T=14, y=3, safe.\n\nI need to move.\n\nIf I go up to y=4 at T=15: action U at T=14, so y_15=4.\n\nAt T=15, on y=4, which is not occupied (only occ T=16), safe.\n\nThen at T=15, I need to choose action for y_16.\n\nIf I go up to y=5, then at T=16, on y=5, which is occupied, collision.\n\nIf I go down to y=3, but at T=16, y=3 occupied, collision.\n\nIf I stay, y=4 at T=16, occupied.\n\nSo from y=4 at T=15, all actions lead to collision at T=16 because whatever I do, y_16 will be 3,4, or 5, all occupied at T=16.\n\nIf at T=15, I am at y=4.\n\nAction at T=15:\n\n- U: y_16=5\n\n- D: y_16=3\n\n- S: y_16=4\n\nAll of y=3,4,5 occupied at T=16, so in all cases, at T=16, player on one of them, collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be at y=4 at T=15, because it forces me to be on a bad y at T=16.\n\nI need to not be on y=4 at T=15, or find a way to be on a safe y at T=16.\n\nAt T=14, instead of going up, I could go down or stay.\n\nBut going down to y=2 or something.\n\nList possible actions.\n\nAt T=14, y=3, safe.\n\nOptions:\n\n- U: go to y=4 at T=15\n\nBut as above, from there, stuck for T=16.\n\n- D: go to y=2 at T=15\n\nThen at T=15, on y=2. Now, y=2 occupied at T=16, not at T=15? y=2 occ T=16 only, not T=15.\n\nAt T=15, on y=2: freeway 2 not occ at T=15 (occ only T=16), so safe.\n\nThen at T=15, I need to choose action for y_16.\n\nIf I go up to y=3, but at T=16, y=3 occupied, collision.\n\nIf down to y=1, at T=16, on y=1. y=1 occupied only at T=15, not at T=16.\n\ny=1 occ T=15, so at T=16, not occupied, safe.\n\nIf stay, y=2 at T=16, occupied.\n\nSo from y=2 at T=15, I can go down to y=1 at T=16.\n\nAction D at T=15: y_16 = 2 -1 =1\n\nThen at T=16, on y=1, which is not occupied (occ only T=15), so safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nSimilarly, at T=14, I could stay: S, then y_15=3.\n\nAt T=15, on y=3. y=3 occupied at T=16, not at T=15? y=3 occ T=16, not T=15, so at T=15, on y=3 safe.\n\nThen at T=15, I need to choose action.\n\nIf U to y=4, then at T=16 on y=4 occ, collision.\n\nIf D to y=2, at T=16 on y=2 occ, collision.\n\nIf S, y=3 at T=16 occ, collision.\n\nSo from y=3 at T=15, all actions lead to collision at T=16.\n\nTherefore, the only safe way is to not be on y=3 at T=15, meaning at T=14, I must move away from y=3.\n\nEither to y=2 or y=4, but going to y=4 at T=15 leads to problem, as before.\n\nGoing to y=2 at T=15 seems possible, then to y=1 at T=16.\n\nThen from y=1 at T=16, I can start going up.\n\nNow, y=1 is safe at T=16.\n\nThen I need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=1, I can go up to y=2, but y=2 occupied at T=16, but at T=16 I am on y=1, so when I go to y=2, it will be at T=17.\n\nLet's plan the path.\n\nStart: T=14, y=3\n\nAction at T=14: D (down to y=2 at T=15)\n\nThen T=15: y=2, safe (not occ)\n\nAction at T=15: D (down to y=1 at T=16)\n\nT=16: y=1, safe (not occ, occ only T=15)\n\nNow, at T=16, on y=1, safe.\n\nNow I need to go up.\n\nAction at T=16: U, to y=2 at T=17\n\nT=17: on y=2. Now, is y=2 occupied at T=17?\n\nFrom above, y=2 occupied only at T=16, not before or after. At T=17, not occupied, so safe.\n\nThen action at T=17: U, to y=3 at T=18\n\nT=18: on y=3. y=3 occupied only at T=16, not at T=18, so safe.\n\nThen action at T=18: U, to y=4 at T=19\n\nT=19: on y=4. y=4 occupied only at T=16, not at T=19, safe.\n\nAction at T=19: U, to y=5 at T=20\n\nT=20: on y=5. y=5 occupied only at T=16, not at T=20, safe.\n\nAction at T=20: U, to y=6 at T=21\n\nT=21: on y=6. Now y=6 occupied at T=18 and 19, not at T=21? From above, occ T=18,19, so at T=21, not occupied, safe.\n\nAction at T=21: U, to y=7 at T=22\n\nT=22: on y=7. y=7 occupied at T=26,27,28, not at T=22, safe.\n\nAction at T=22: U, to y=8 at T=23\n\nT=23: on y=8. y=8 occupied at T=26,27,28,29, not at T=23, safe.\n\nAction at T=23: U, to y=9 at T=24\n\nT=24: on y=9, which is safe, and we reached.\n\nNow, how many turns? From T=14 to T=24, but we reach at T=24, meaning after action at T=23, we are at y=9 at T=24.\n\nThe number of actions: actions from T=14 to T=23, that's 10 actions? Let's list the turns.\n\nStart T=14, position y=3.\n\nAfter action at T=14, y=2 at T=15\n\nAfter action at T=15, y=1 at T=16\n\nAfter action at T=16, y=2 at T=17\n\nAfter action at T=17, y=3 at T=18\n\nAfter action at T=18, y=4 at T=19\n\nAfter action at T=19, y=5 at T=20\n\nAfter action at T=20, y=6 at T=21\n\nAfter action at T=21, y=7 at T=22\n\nAfter action at T=22, y=8 at T=23\n\nAfter action at T=23, y=9 at T=24\n\nSo at T=24, we are at y=9. The last action is at T=23, and H is the number of turns from start, including the actions to move.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so T from t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nHere t1=14, we have actions from T=14 to T=23, which is 10 actions: T=14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23.\n\nThen at T=24, we are at y=9, which is after H actions.\n\nThe minimal H: we started at y=3, need to go to y=9, difference 6, but we took 10 actions because we went down first.\n\nIs there a shorter way?\n\nPerhaps I can avoid going all the way down to y=1.\n\nFor example, at T=16, I need to be on a safe y, like y=6 or y=7.\n\nBut at T=14, y=3, to reach y=6 by T=16, I need to go up quickly.\n\nFrom T=14 to T=16, in two actions, I can go up to y=5 or something.\n\nAt T=14: U to y=4 at T=15\n\nBut at T=15, if I U to y=5 at T=16, but y=5 occ at T=16, collision.\n\nIf at T=15, I go up to y=5, but at T=16 on y=5 occ.\n\nCannot.\n\nAt T=14, U to y=4 at T=15\n\nThen at T=15, instead of moving, I could stay or down, but all lead to occupied y at T=16.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=6 directly, but from y=3 to y=6 in two actions: U,U to y=5 at T=16? But y=5 occ.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt T=14, I stay: S, y=3 at T=15\n\nThen at T=15, I must move, but if U to y=4 at T=16, occ; D to y=2 at T=16 occ; S y=3 occ.\n\nAll bad.\n\nSo indeed, the only way to avoid T=16 collision is to be on y=1 or y=6 or above at T=16.\n\ny=6 at T=16: is it possible?\n\nFrom T=14 y=3, to y=6 at T=16, that would require two U actions: U at T=14 to y=4 at T=15, then U at T=15 to y=5 at T=16? But y=5 at T=16, not y=6.\n\ny_16 is the position after action at T=15.\n\nAfter action at T=15, y_16 is set.\n\nTo be at y=6 at T=16, I need y_15=5 or 6 or 7, and action accordingly.\n\nAt T=14, y=3.\n\nIf I U at T=14, to y=4 at T=15.\n\nThen at T=15, if I U, to y=5 at T=16.\n\nBut y=5 at T=16 occ.\n\nIf at T=15 I do U, y_16=5, not 6.\n\nTo reach y=6 at T=16, I need from T=15 position.\n\ny_16 = y_15 + Δy from action at T=15.\n\nSo to have y_16=6, I need y_15=5,6, or7 with appropriate action.\n\nBut at T=15, I am at y=4 if I U at T=14.\n\nThen from y=4, I can go to y=5 with U, or to y=4 with S, or y=3 with D, cannot reach y=6 directly.\n\nSimilarly, if I do something else at T=14.\n\nSuppose at T=14, I do D to y=2 at T=15.\n\nThen at T=15, y=2.\n\nTo have y_16=6, I need to go up 4 steps? Not possible, max one step per turn.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=6 at T=16 starting from y=3 at T=14.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 even harder.\n\nSo the only safe y at T=16 are y=0,1,6,7,8,9 but y=6,7,8 not reachable from y=3 in two actions (from T=14 to T=16 actions).\n\nActions: from T=14 to set y_15, then T=15 to set y_16.\n\nSo two actions, max change 2 in y.\n\nFrom y=3, can go to y=1,2,3,4,5 at T=16? y_16 can be from 1 to 5 if I go down or up.\n\ny_16 possibilities:\n\n- Start y_14=3\n\n- After a_14, y_15 = 3 + Δy, Δy -1,0,1 so y_15=2,3,4\n\n- Then after a_15, y_16 = y_15 + Δy, so if y_15=2, y_16=1,2,3\n\nIf y_15=3, y_16=2,3,4\n\nIf y_15=4, y_16=3,4,5\n\nSo possible y_16: 1,2,3,4,5\n\nBut at T=16, y=2,3,4,5 all occupied, only y=1 is safe among these.\n\ny=0 possible? y=0 is safe, but to reach y=0 at T=16, I need to go down.\n\nFor example, from y=3 at T=14, D to y=2 at T=15, then D to y=1 at T=16? y_16=1 if from y_15=2 and D.\n\ny_16=1.\n\nOr from y_15=2 and S, y_16=2, occ.\n\nBut y=1 is safe at T=16.\n\ny=0: if I go down twice: from y=3, D to y=2, then D to y=1, y_16=1, not 0.\n\nTo reach y=0, I need y_15=1 and D, but at T=15, if I am at y=1, then D to y=0 at T=16.\n\nBut to be at y=1 at T=15: from T=14, if I do D, y_15=2, not 1.\n\nIf I do D at T=14 to y=2 at T=15, then I can go to y=1 at T=16, but not to y=0 directly.\n\nTo be at y=0 at T=16, I need y_15=1 and action D at T=15.\n\nBut to be at y=1 at T=15: from y=3 at T=14, if I do D, y_15=2; S, y_15=3; U, y_15=4. Cannot be at y=1 at T=15. So impossible to be at y=0 or y=6 or above at T=16. Only possible safe y at T=16 is y=1, as I had in the path.\n\nThus, the path I have seems necessary: go down to y=1 by T=16.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nIn that path, I used 10 turns to reach y=9 at T=24.\n\nBut perhaps I can go faster after T=16.\n\nIn the path: from T=16 y=1, I went to y=2 at T=17, y=3 at T=18, etc., up to y=9 at T=24.\n\nBut from y=1 to y=9, difference 8, so min 8 actions, but I started from T=16 y=1, to T=24 y=9, that's 8 actions: from T=16 to T=23 actions.\n\nT=16 action to set y_17, ..., up to T=23 action to set y_24=9.\n\nActions at T=16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23: 8 actions for from y=1 to y=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, before that, from T=14 to T=15: two actions to go down to y=1 at T=16.\n\nT=14: action to set y_15\n\nT=15: action to set y_16=1\n\nSo two actions to reach y=1 at T=16.\n\nThen 8 actions to go from y=1 to y=9, reaching at T=24.\n\nTotal actions: 10.\n\nBut from y=1 to y=9, I can go directly up, no need to wait, since no collisions on the way except y=6 at T=18,19, but in my path I was on y=6 at T=21, which is safe.\n\nCould I go faster? For example, from y=1 at T=16, go up multiple times, but I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nAt T=16, y=1, I go U to y=2 at T=17.\n\nThen U to y=3 at T=18, and so on.\n\ny=6 is occupied at T=18 and 19, so I need to avoid being on y=6 at those times.\n\nIn my path, I was on y=6 at T=21, which is after, safe.\n\nIf I go faster, say from T=16 y=1, U to y=2 at T=17, U to y=3 at T=18.\n\nAt T=18, on y=3, safe, not occ.\n\nThen if I go U to y=4 at T=19.\n\nAt T=19, on y=4, safe.\n\nThen U to y=5 at T=20, safe.\n\nThen U to y=6 at T=21.\n\nBut at T=18, I could go directly to y=4? No, step by step.\n\nFrom y=3 at T=18, I can only go to y=2,3,4 at T=19.\n\nIf I go U to y=4 at T=19.\n\nThen to y=5 at T=20, etc.\n\nBut y=6 occ at T=18,19, so at T=19, if I were on y=6, but I can't be.\n\nAt T=18, I am on y=3, not y=6.\n\nTo be on y=6 at T=19, I need from T=18 position.\n\nSuppose at T=18, I am at y=5, then U to y=6 at T=19.\n\nBut y=6 occ at T=19, so collision.\n\nIf I am at y=6 at T=18, occ.\n\nSo I must avoid being on y=6 at T=18 or T=19.\n\nIn the path, I am on y=6 at T=21, which is fine.\n\nCould I be on y=6 at T=20? Then not occ.\n\nTo reach y=6 at T=20.\n\nFor example, from T=16 y=1, I need to get to y=6 in 4 actions? From T=16 to T=20.\n\nActions: T=16,17,18,19 to set y_17,y_18,y_19,y_20.\n\ny_20 = y after action at T=19.\n\nTo have y_20=6.\n\nStart y_16=1\n\nAfter a_16, y_17 = y_16 + Δy, so 0,1,2\n\nBut y min 0, so y_17=0,1,2\n\nSimilarly, y_18, etc.\n\nMax y increase: all U, y_17=2, y_18=3, y_19=4, y_20=5, so y=5 at T=20.\n\nCannot reach y=6 at T=20 from y=1 at T=16 in 4 actions? Actions at T=16,17,18,19 for y_17 to y_20.\n\ny_16=1\n\na_16: U, y_17=2\n\na_17: U, y_18=3\n\na_18: U, y_19=4\n\na_19: U, y_20=5\n\ny=5 at T=20.\n\nIf I do double U or something, but no, each action only one step.\n\nSo maximum y=5 at T=20.\n\nThen y=6 at T=21, as before.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at T=22, etc.\n\nSo cannot reach faster.\n\nThus the path I have is optimal: 10 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, I reached at T=24 with 10 actions.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence of actions from t1=14 onwards.\n\nt1=14.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t1: a_{14} = D  (to go down to y=2 at next turn)\n\nIn the sequence, at turn T, action a_T determines the next position.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nSo for turn 14, action.\n\nIn my path:\n\nAt turn 14: action D, so y at turn 15 is 2.\n\nThen turn 15: action D, y at turn 16 is 1.\n\nTurn 16: action U, y at turn 17 is 2.\n\nTurn 17: action U, y at turn 18 is 3.\n\nTurn 18: action U, y at turn 19 is 4.\n\nTurn 19: action U, y at turn 20 is 5.\n\nTurn 20: action U, y at turn 21 is 6.\n\nTurn 21: action U, y at turn 22 is 7.\n\nTurn 22: action U, y at turn 23 is 8.\n\nTurn 23: action U, y at turn 24 is 9.\n\nAnd we reach at turn 24.\n\nH=10 turns, from t=0 to H-1, so actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=14, actions at 14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23: 10 actions.\n\nNow, but at some points, I could have gone faster, but due to the cars, I had to go down first.\n\nIs there a way with H=9?\n\nSuppose I can reach y=9 earlier.\n\nBut from above, min from y=1 to y=9 is 8 actions, and I need 2 actions to get to y=1, so 10 min.\n\nIf I don't go to y=1, but to another safe point.\n\nFor example, at T=16, y=7 is safe, but I can't reach it.\n\ny=0: but y=0 is safe, but going down to y=0 might not help, since I need to go up.\n\nFor example, at T=14, if I go down to y=2 at T=15, then down to y=1 at T=16, as before.\n\nIf at T=14, I go down to y=2, then at T=15, instead of down, I could go up, but to y=3 at T=16, occupied.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo no shorter path.\n\nThus, minimal H=10.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have actions.\n\nBut let me confirm the collision points.\n\nIn the path:\n\nT=14: y=3, not occ, safe.\n\nT=15: y=2, freeway 2 occ only T=16, not T=15, safe.\n\nT=16: y=1, freeway 1 occ only T=15, not T=16, safe.\n\nT=17: y=2, occ only T=16, not T=17, safe.\n\nT=18: y=3, occ only T=16, not T=18, safe.\n\nT=19: y=4, occ only T=16, not T=19, safe.\n\nT=20: y=5, occ only T=16, not T=20, safe.\n\nT=21: y=6, occ at T=18,19, not T=21, safe.\n\nT=22: y=7, occ at T=26-28, not T=22, safe.\n\nT=23: y=8, occ at T=26-29, not T=23, safe.\n\nT=24: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 14: D\n\nTurn 15: D\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut H=10, and actions from t=0 to H-1, which is t1 to t1+9, since t1=14, up to 23.\n\nt1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for H=10, t from 0 to 9, so turns t1+0 to t1+9, i.e., 14 to 23.\n\nActions: as above.\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nBut let me write it clearly.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 14\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The cars' movements and collision conditions are analyzed based on the given car states and update rules. The key collision times are:\n\n- Freeway 1 is occupied at turn 15.\n- Freeways 2, 3, 4, and 5 are occupied at turn 16.\n- Freeway 6 is occupied at turns 18 and 19.\n- Freeway 7 is occupied at turns 26, 27, and 28.\n- Freeway 8 is occupied at turns 26, 27, 28, and 29.\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 14, which is safe since freeway 3 is not occupied at turn 14. To avoid the collision at turn 16 (where freeways 2, 3, 4, and 5 are occupied), the player must move down to \\(y = 1\\) by turn 16. From there, the player can move up directly to \\(y = 9\\) without encountering any collisions, as the path avoids the occupied times for freeways 6, 7, and 8.\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 10, with actions from turn 14 to turn 23. The sequence of actions is:\n\n- At turn 14, move down (D) to reach \\(y = 2\\) at turn 15.\n- At turn 15, move down (D) to reach \\(y = 1\\) at turn 16.\n- At turn 16, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 2\\) at turn 17.\n- At turn 17, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 3\\) at turn 18.\n- At turn 18, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 4\\) at turn 19.\n- At turn 19, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 5\\) at turn 20.\n- At turn 20, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 6\\) at turn 21.\n- At turn 21, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 7\\) at turn 22.\n- At turn 22, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 23.\n- At turn 23, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 24.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 24, avoiding all collisions, and \\(H = 10\\) is minimal.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: D \\\\\nTurn 15: D \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: U \\\\\nTurn 22: U \\\\\nTurn 23: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 2) at turn t_1 = 15. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y_T and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn. The car spans move left or right based on their direction and speed.\n\nImportantly, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, if they move to y_{T+1}, they are still on y_T for collision purposes at turn T, and only on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions from turn 15 onwards to get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nFirst, let's list the car states at turn 15 for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head=0, tail=-47, direction=right, speed=48. Since direction is right, the span is [τ, h] = [-47, 0]. But head and tail: it says (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, head is the front, so span is [tail, head] = [-47, 0] at t=15.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it's [head, tail], but head and tail might be confusing. Let me read the car update rules.\n\nFor left-moving: span(t) = [h, τ] and at T, [h - s(T-t), τ - s(T-t)]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t) = [τ, h] and at T, [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)]\n\nIn the state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). I need to interpret what head and tail mean.\n\nFor right-moving, it says: span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head, and since it's moving right, tail is left, head is right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ], so h is head, τ is tail, but for left-moving, head is left, tail is right? That might be inconsistent.\n\nLet's see the example in freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48). Since direction right, span should be [tail, head] = [-47, 0]. At turn 15.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: (12, 47, left, 36). Direction left, so span should be [head, tail] = [12, 47] at t=15? But 12 to 47, and moving left, so decreasing.\n\nIn the car update, for left-moving, it says span becomes [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so since it's moving left, the positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right, positions increase.\n\nNow, collision at turn T if player is on freeway y_T, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nPlayer position y_t is vertical, freeway k corresponds to y=k, I think.\n\nFreeway k is at y=k, for k=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer at (0, y_t), so horizontal position is always 0? The grid is 2D, but player is always at x=0, I think? From the position (0, y_t), so x=0 fixed, y changes.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to 8, and they have horizontal positions.\n\nCollision when player is at (0, y) and y is the freeway, and at that turn, a car on that freeway has span covering x=0.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to know when x=0 is covered by a car.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, I need to simulate or find times when it's safe to be on each freeway.\n\nThe player starts at y=2 at t=15.\n\ny=2 is freeway 2? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=2 is freeway 2.\n\nAt turn t, if player is on y_t, and y_t between 1 and 8, then collision possible if 0 in span for that freeway at t.\n\nIf y_t=0 or y_t=9, no freeway, so no collision.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is safe.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,2), which is freeway 2, so at turn 15, we need to check if there is collision at t=15 on freeway 2.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the times when x=0 is covered, meaning unsafe at that turn.\n\nI need for each freeway, the set of turns where 0 is in some car's span.\n\nSince cars move continuously in time, but turns are discrete, so at integer turns.\n\nΔT = T - t1, integer.\n\nt1 is fixed at 15.\n\nSo for a given freeway, at turn T, for each car, compute the span at T, see if 0 in it.\n\nThen if any car on that freeway has 0 in span at T, then freeway is unsafe at T.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nPlayer can be on freeway only if safe at that turn, or if moving through, but when moving, at turn T, player is on y_T, and collision depends on y_T.\n\nIf player moves to a new y, at turn T, action changes y for next turn, so at turn T, after action, y_{T+1} is set, but for collision at T, it's based on y_T.\n\nFrom game dynamics: at turn T, player is at y_T, and collision checked based on y_T.\n\nIf action a_T moves to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, player is still on y_T.\n\nSo for collision at turn T, only y_T matters.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=2.\n\ny=9 is above, so probably need to move up, but might need to wait or move down to avoid cars.\n\nMinimal turns, so ideally go up as fast as possible, but avoid unsafe freeways at wrong times.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each freeway the unsafe times.\n\nDefine ΔT = T - 15, so at T=15, ΔT=0.\n\nFor each freeway, list cars and their spans at time ΔT.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, (head=0, tail=-47, direction=right, speed=48)\n\nDirection right, so span at ΔT: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-47 + 48 ΔT, 0 + 48 ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -47 + 48 ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 0 + 48 ΔT\n\nSince the span is [left, right] with left <= right.\n\n-47 + 48 ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 48 ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -47 + 48 ΔT ≤ 0 => 48 ΔT ≤ 47 => ΔT ≤ 47/48 ≈ 0.979, so ΔT <= 0 since ΔT integer? ΔT is integer, T turn.\n\nΔT = T - 15, integer >=0.\n\nSo -47 + 48 ΔT ≤ 0 => 48 ΔT ≤ 47 => ΔT ≤ 47/48 < 1, so for ΔT=0, it holds: -47 + 0 = -47 ≤ 0, true.\n\n0 ≤ 48 ΔT: for ΔT=0, 0≤0, true.\n\nSo at ΔT=0, 0 is in [-47,0].\n\nFor ΔT=1, span [-47+48, 0+48] = [1,48], 0 not in [1,48], since 0<1.\n\nSimilarly for higher ΔT.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe only at ΔT=0, i.e., T=15.\n\nAt T=15, freeway 1 is unsafe? But player is on y=2, not y=1.\n\nFreeway 1 is y=1.\n\nAt T=15, if player were on y=1, unsafe, but player is on y=2.\n\nFor freeway 1, unsafe only at T=15.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-12, -23, right, 12) direction right, so tail τ=-23? Head and tail: given (head, tail, dir, speed) = (-12, -23, right, 12)\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-23, -12]? But it says head and tail, I think head is the front.\n\nIn the state: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor right-moving, since direction right, head should be larger than tail, I assume.\n\nHere head=-12, tail=-23, so head > tail, since -12 > -23, so span [τ, h] = [-23, -12] at ΔT=0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (60, 49, right, 12), head=60, tail=49, so 60>49, span [49,60] at ΔT=0.\n\nNow at ΔT, span for first car: since right-moving, [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-23 + 12 ΔT, -12 + 12 ΔT]\n\nSecond car: [49 + 12 ΔT, 60 + 12 ΔT]\n\n0 in first car span if -23 + 12 ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -12 + 12 ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -23 + 12 ΔT ≤ 0 => 12 ΔT ≤ 23 => ΔT ≤ 23/12 ≈ 1.916, so ΔT <=1\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -12 + 12 ΔT => 12 ≤ 12 ΔT => ΔT >=1\n\nSo both: ΔT >=1 and ΔT <=1, so only at ΔT=1.\n\n-23 + 12 ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -12 + 12 ΔT\n\n0 ≤ -12 + 12 ΔT => 12 ΔT >= 12 => ΔT >=1\n\n-23 + 12 ΔT ≤ 0 => 12 ΔT ≤ 23 => ΔT ≤ 23/12 ≈ 1.916, so ΔT=1 only, since integer.\n\nAt ΔT=1: -23+12= -11 ≤0? -11 ≤0 true, 0 ≤ -12+12=0, 0≤0 true.\n\nAt ΔT=0: -23 ≤0 true, but 0 ≤ -12? 0 ≤ -12 false, so not satisfied.\n\nAt ΔT=2: -23+24=1 ≤0? 1≤0 false.\n\nSo only ΔT=1 for first car.\n\nNow second car: 0 in [49 +12ΔT, 60+12ΔT]?\n\n49 +12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 60+12ΔT\n\nBut 49 +12ΔT >=49 >0 for ΔT>=0, so left end >0, so 0 not in span since span starts at 49+12ΔT >0.\n\nSimilarly for higher ΔT.\n\nSo only first car can cover 0, and only at ΔT=1, T=16.\n\nSo freeway 2 unsafe at T=16.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Cars: (-12, -23, right, 12) and (60, 49, right, 12)\n\nExactly same as freeway 2, so unsafe only at T=16.\n\nFreeway 4: one car? (12, 47, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so span at t1 is [h, τ] = [12, 47]? Head=12, tail=47, but for left-moving, head is left, tail is right? Since moving left, positions decrease.\n\nIn the rule: for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], and at T, [h - s ΔT, τ - s ΔT]\n\nHere h=12, τ=47, so at ΔT, span [12 - 36 ΔT, 47 - 36 ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 12 - 36 ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 47 - 36 ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: 12 - 36 ΔT ≤ 0 => 12 ≤ 36 ΔT => ΔT >= 12/36 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333, so ΔT >=1\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 47 - 36 ΔT => 36 ΔT ≤ 47 => ΔT ≤ 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so ΔT <=1\n\nThus ΔT=1.\n\nAt ΔT=1: 12-36= -24 ≤0 true, 0≤47-36=11, 0≤11 true.\n\nAt ΔT=0: 12≤0? false.\n\nAt ΔT=2: 12-72= -60≤0 true, but 0≤47-72= -25? 0≤-25 false.\n\nSo only ΔT=1, T=16.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4? (12, 47, left, 36), so unsafe at T=16.\n\nFreeway 6: one car (-18, -29, right, 6)\n\nDirection right, head=-18? Tail τ=-29, head h=-18.\n\nSpan at ΔT: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-29 + 6 ΔT, -18 + 6 ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -29 + 6 ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -18 + 6 ΔT\n\nFirst: -29 + 6 ΔT ≤ 0 => 6 ΔT ≤ 29 => ΔT ≤ 29/6 ≈ 4.833, so ΔT <=4\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -18 + 6 ΔT => 18 ≤ 6 ΔT => ΔT >= 3\n\nSo both: ΔT >=3 and ΔT <=4? ΔT <=4 and ΔT >=3, so ΔT=3 or 4.\n\nCheck:\n\nΔT=3: -29+18= -11 ≤0 true, 0 ≤ -18+18=0, true.\n\nΔT=4: -29+24= -5 ≤0 true, 0 ≤ -18+24=6, true.\n\nΔT=2: -29+12= -17≤0 true, but 0 ≤ -18+12= -6? 0≤-6 false.\n\nΔT=5: -29+30=1≤0 false.\n\nSo unsafe at ΔT=3 and 4, T=18 and 19.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-44, -55, right, 4) direction right, head=-44, tail=-55? Head should be greater, -44 > -55, yes.\n\nSpan [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-55 + 4 ΔT, -44 + 4 ΔT]\n\nSecond car: (20, 9, right, 4) head=20, tail=9, span [9 + 4 ΔT, 20 + 4 ΔT]\n\nNow, 0 in first car span: -55 + 4 ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -44 + 4 ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -55 + 4 ΔT ≤ 0 => 4 ΔT ≤ 55 => ΔT ≤ 55/4 = 13.75, so ΔT <=13\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -44 + 4 ΔT => 44 ≤ 4 ΔT => ΔT >= 11\n\nSo ΔT from 11 to 13 inclusive? ΔT >=11 and ΔT <=13, so 11,12,13.\n\nCheck:\n\nΔT=11: -55+44= -11≤0 true, 0≤ -44+44=0 true.\n\nΔT=12: -55+48= -7≤0 true, 0≤ -44+48=4 true.\n\nΔT=13: -55+52= -3≤0 true, 0≤ -44+52=8 true.\n\nΔT=10: -55+40= -15≤0 true, but 0≤ -44+40= -4? false.\n\nΔT=14: -55+56=1≤0 false.\n\nNow second car: 0 in [9+4ΔT, 20+4ΔT]\n\n9+4ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 20+4ΔT\n\nBut 9+4ΔT >=9>0 for ΔT>=0, so left end >0, 0 not in span.\n\nSo only first car matters, unsafe at ΔT=11,12,13, T=26,27,28.\n\nT=15 + ΔT, so T=26,27,28.\n\nNow freeway 8: one car (-33, -44, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, head=-33, tail=-44.\n\nSpan [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-44 + 3 ΔT, -33 + 3 ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -44 + 3 ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -33 + 3 ΔT\n\nFirst: -44 + 3 ΔT ≤ 0 => 3 ΔT ≤ 44 => ΔT ≤ 44/3 ≈ 14.666, so ΔT <=14\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -33 + 3 ΔT => 33 ≤ 3 ΔT => ΔT >= 11\n\nSo ΔT from 11 to 14 inclusive? ΔT >=11 and ΔT <=14, so 11,12,13,14.\n\nCheck:\n\nΔT=11: -44+33= -11≤0 true, 0≤ -33+33=0 true.\n\nΔT=12: -44+36= -8≤0 true, 0≤ -33+36=3 true.\n\nΔT=13: -44+39= -5≤0 true, 0≤ -33+39=6 true.\n\nΔT=14: -44+42= -2≤0 true, 0≤ -33+42=9 true.\n\nΔT=10: -44+30= -14≤0 true, but 0≤ -33+30= -3? false.\n\nΔT=15: -44+45=1≤0 false.\n\nSo unsafe at ΔT=11,12,13,14, T=26,27,28,29.\n\nNow, summarize unsafe turns for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: unsafe at T=15 (only)\n\n- y=2: unsafe at T=16\n\n- y=3: unsafe at T=16\n\n- y=4: unsafe at T=16\n\n- y=5: unsafe at T=16\n\n- y=6: unsafe at T=18,19\n\n- y=7: unsafe at T=26,27,28\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=26,27,28,29\n\nAlso, y=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at T=15.\n\nAt T=15, y=2, is freeway 2 safe at T=15? From above, freeway 2 unsafe only at T=16, so at T=15, it should be safe? Let me confirm.\n\nAt T=15, ΔT=0.\n\nFreeway 2: first car span [-23, -12], 0 not in, since -23 to -12, all negative, 0 not <= -12? -12 <0, so x=0 > -12, not in span.\n\nSecond car [49,60], 0 not in. So yes, safe at T=15.\n\nSimilarly, at T=16, unsafe for y=2.\n\nNow player at (0,2) at T=15, safe.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9).\n\ny=9 is safe always.\n\nThe minimal H might be direct up, but need to avoid unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nSince we start at y=2, and go to y=9, difference 7, so minimal moves: if we go up every turn, 7 turns, but may hit unsafe spots.\n\nBut we can stay or move down to avoid.\n\nFirst, let's see the unsafe times.\n\nFreeways 2,3,4,5 all unsafe only at T=16? y=2,3,4,5 all unsafe at T=16.\n\ny=2,3,4,5 all have unsafe at T=16 only, except y=6 at T=18,19, etc.\n\ny=1 unsafe at T=15 only.\n\nPlayer is at y=2 at T=15, safe.\n\nNow, if we try to go up directly: at T=15, action U, so y_{16} = 3.\n\nBut at T=16, player will be on y=3, which is unsafe at T=16 (since y=3 unsafe at T=16).\n\nCollision.\n\nIf action S at T=15, y_{16} = 2, then at T=16, on y=2, which is unsafe at T=16.\n\nAlso collision.\n\nIf action D at T=15, y_{16} = 1, then at T=16, on y=1.\n\ny=1 is unsafe only at T=15, at T=16 it should be safe.\n\nAt T=16, ΔT=1, freeway 1: span [ -47+48(1), 0+48(1) ] = [1,48], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nBut at T=16, player on y=1, which is safe.\n\nThen from there, can go up.\n\nBut we are at y=1, need to go to y=9.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nTo avoid T=16, since y=2,3,4,5 all unsafe at T=16, we need not to be on these freeways at T=16.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Go down to y=1 at T=16.\n\n- Stay at y=0? y=0 is safe, but we start at y=2, so to go to y=0, need to move down.\n\ny=0 is safe always.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\nAt T=15, player at y=2.\n\nPossible actions:\n\n- U: y_{16} = 3\n\n- S: y_{16} = 2\n\n- D: y_{16} = 1\n\nBut at T=16, if on y=2 or y=3, unsafe. If on y=1, safe.\n\nIf U, at T=16 on y=3, unsafe.\n\nIf S, at T=16 on y=2, unsafe.\n\nIf D, at T=16 on y=1, safe.\n\nSo only safe action at T=15 is D, to y=1 at T=16.\n\nThen at T=16, we are on y=1, which is safe.\n\nNow, from there, we need to go up.\n\nAt T=16, we can choose action.\n\ny_{17} depends on action at T=16.\n\nNow, freeways: y=2,3,4,5 unsafe only at T=16, so after T=16, they are safe.\n\nFor example, y=2: unsafe only T=16, so at T=17, safe? At T=17, ΔT=2.\n\nFreeway 2: first car span [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [49+24,60+24]=[73,84], no. So safe at T=17.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 same.\n\ny=4: at T=17, ΔT=2, span for car [12-72,47-72]=[-60,-25]? Left-moving, [h - s ΔT, τ - s ΔT] = [12 - 36*2, 47 - 36*2] = [12-72, 47-72] = [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly y=5 same.\n\ny=6 unsafe at T=18,19.\n\ny=7 and 8 unsafe later.\n\nSo after T=16, y=2,3,4,5 are safe at all times except T=16 which has passed.\n\ny=1 safe except T=15, passed.\n\nSo from T=16, we are at y=1.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nWe can go up freely through y=2,3,4,5 since they are safe now.\n\nBut y=6 is unsafe at T=18 and 19.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and 8 unsafe at T=26+.\n\nT=26 is later, since now we are at T=16.\n\nFirst, from y=1 at T=16, we can go up.\n\nMinimal to go up to y=9, need 8 steps? From y=1 to y=9, difference 8, so 8 moves up.\n\nBut may need to avoid y=6 at T=18,19.\n\nLet's see the time.\n\nAt T=16, y=1.\n\nIf we go up at each turn:\n\nT=16: action U, y_{17} = 2\n\nAt T=17, on y=2, which is safe (since unsafe only T=16)\n\nT=17: action U, y_{18} = 3\n\nAt T=18, on y=3, safe? y=3 unsafe only T=16, so T=18 safe.\n\nBut y=6 is unsafe at T=18, but we are on y=3 at T=18.\n\nContinue: T=18: action U, y_{19} = 4\n\nAt T=19, on y=4, safe.\n\ny=4 unsafe only T=16, so T=19 safe.\n\nT=19: action U, y_{20} = 5\n\nAt T=20, on y=5, safe.\n\nT=20: action U, y_{21} = 6\n\nAt T=21, on y=6.\n\nNow, y=6 unsafe at T=18 and 19.\n\nAt T=21, ΔT=6, since T=15+6=21.\n\nFreeway 6: car span at ΔT=6: [-29 + 6*6, -18 + 6*6] = [-29+36, -18+36] = [7,18], 0 not in, so safe at T=21.\n\nSimilarly, T=20: ΔT=5, [-29+30, -18+30]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nT=19: ΔT=4, [-29+24, -18+24]=[-5,6], 0 in, unsafe.\n\nT=18: ΔT=3, [-29+18, -18+18]=[-11,0], 0 in, unsafe.\n\nSo at T=21, y=6 safe.\n\nBack to sequence: at T=20, on y=5, action U to y_{21}=6.\n\nAt T=21, on y=6, safe.\n\nThen T=21: action U, y_{22} = 7\n\nAt T=22, on y=7.\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=26,27,28.\n\nT=22, ΔT=7, freeway 7: first car span [-55 + 4*7, -44 + 4*7] = [-55+28, -44+28] = [-27,-16], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [9+28,20+28]=[37,48], no. So safe at T=22.\n\nSimilarly, T=22: action U, y_{23} = 8\n\nAt T=23, on y=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=26,27,28,29.\n\nT=23, ΔT=8, freeway 8: span [-44 + 3*8, -33 + 3*8] = [-44+24, -33+24] = [-20,-9], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen T=23: action U, y_{24} = 9\n\nAt T=24, on y=9, which is safe, goal reached.\n\ny_{24} = 9 at T=24, but we need to be at (0,9), so at turn T=24, position (0,9).\n\nNow, let's list the turns and actions.\n\nStart at T=15, y=2.\n\nAction at T=15: we decided D, to go to y=1 at T=16.\n\nThen at T=16, y=1.\n\nAction at T=16: U, to y=2 at T=17.\n\nT=17: on y=2, action U, to y=3 at T=18.\n\nT=18: on y=3, action U, to y=4 at T=19.\n\nT=19: on y=4, action U, to y=5 at T=20.\n\nT=20: on y=5, action U, to y=6 at T=21.\n\nT=21: on y=6, action U, to y=7 at T=22.\n\nT=22: on y=7, action U, to y=8 at T=23.\n\nT=23: on y=8, action U, to y=9 at T=24.\n\nAt T=24, on y=9, done.\n\nTotal turns from start: from T=15 to T=24, that's 10 turns? T=15 to T=24 inclusive? No.\n\nThe sequence: actions from t=15 to t=23, that's 9 actions? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at t=15 with position given.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=15 + H, position y_{15+H}.\n\nWe need y_{15+H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=15 to t=15 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t=15 + H.\n\nAt turn t=15 + H, y_t =9.\n\nIn this case, at T=24, y=9, so t=15 + H =24, so H=9.\n\nActions from t=15 to t=23, that's 9 actions.\n\nList:\n\nTurn t=15: action D (to y=1 at t=16)\n\nTurn t=16: action U (to y=2 at t=17)\n\nt=17: U (to y=3 at t=18)\n\nt=18: U (to y=4 at t=19)\n\nt=19: U (to y=5 at t=20)\n\nt=20: U (to y=6 at t=21)\n\nt=21: U (to y=7 at t=22)\n\nt=22: U (to y=8 at t=23)\n\nt=23: U (to y=9 at t=24)\n\nAt t=24, y=9.\n\nNow, check if all positions safe:\n\nt=15: y=2, safe as above.\n\nt=16: y=1, safe.\n\nt=17: y=2, safe (T=17 not unsafe)\n\nt=18: y=3, safe (T=18 not unsafe for y=3)\n\nt=19: y=4, safe\n\nt=20: y=5, safe\n\nt=21: y=6, safe (T=21 not unsafe for y=6)\n\nt=22: y=7, safe (T=22 <26)\n\nt=23: y=8, safe (T=23 <26)\n\nt=24: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is this minimal H?\n\nH=9, from t=15 to t=24.\n\nBut we started at y=2, to y=9, difference 7, so minimal without obstacles is 7 turns, but we had to go down to y=1 first, adding one extra step.\n\nCan we do with H=8?\n\nThat is, reach at t=23.\n\ny_{23}=9.\n\nStart at t=15, y=2.\n\nAfter 8 actions, at t=15+8=23, y=9.\n\nSo need to go from y=2 to y=9 in 8 moves, net up 7, so must have 7 U and 1 other move, which could be S or D.\n\nIf S, then at some point stay, but y same, takes extra turn.\n\nIf D, go down, then need to come back, worse.\n\nBut with obstacles, maybe possible.\n\nFor example, if we can avoid the down move.\n\nBut at t=16, y=2,3,4,5 all unsafe, so we cannot be on them at t=16.\n\nIf we go up at t=15, y_{16}=3, but unsafe at t=16.\n\nIf we stay, y_{16}=2, unsafe.\n\nSo must go down to y=1 at t=16.\n\nNo other choice at t=15.\n\nPerhaps go to y=0.\n\ny=0 is safe.\n\nAt t=15, if we go down twice? But actions one at a time.\n\nAt t=15, action D, to y=1 at t=16.\n\nThen at t=16, we can go down again to y=0 at t=17? But that might not help.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=16, we need to go up.\n\nTo reach y=9 faster.\n\nWith 8 actions, from y=2 to y=9, net +7, so if all U, 7 actions, but we need 8 actions? No.\n\nAfter k actions, y_{15+k} = y_15 + net moves.\n\ny_15=2, y_{15+H} =9, so net +7.\n\nEach U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\nSo sum of Δy over actions must be +7.\n\nWith H actions, the number of U minus number of D must be 7.\n\nAnd number of S = H - number U - number D.\n\nBut to minimize H, we want as few S and D as possible.\n\nMinimal H when no S or D, all U, H=7.\n\nBut with obstacles, may need more.\n\nIn this case, with H=7, all U: start at t=15, y=2.\n\nt=15: U, y_{16}=3\n\nt=16: at y=3, but t=16, y=3 unsafe, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nt=15: S, y_{16}=2, then at t=16, y=2 unsafe.\n\nt=15: D, y_{16}=1, then at t=16, y=1 safe.\n\nThen from t=16, y=1, need to go to y=9 in 6 more actions? To reach at t=15+7=22.\n\ny_{22}=9.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=16, to y=9 at t=22, that's 6 actions? Actions from t=16 to t=21.\n\nAfter actions at t=16 to t=21, 6 actions, y_{22}=9.\n\ny_16=1, y_{22}=9, net +8, but with 6 actions, impossible since max increase 6.\n\ny_{22} - y_16 = net moves from actions at t=16 to t=21.\n\nEach action affects next y.\n\nAt time t, after action, y_{t+1} set.\n\nStart: before any action, at t=15, y=2.\n\nAfter action a_{15}, y_{16} = y_{15} + Δy_{15}\n\nAfter a_{16}, y_{17} = y_{16} + Δy_{16}, etc.\n\nAt turn t, position is y_t.\n\nTo have y_{15+H} =9.\n\nWith H actions from t=15 to t=15+H-1.\n\ny_{15+H} = y_{15} + sum_{t=15}^{15+H-1} Δy_t\n\ny_{15}=2, y_{15+H}=9, so sum Δy_t = 7.\n\nEach Δy_t in {-1,0,1}.\n\nMinimal H when all Δy_t=1, H=7.\n\nBut not possible because at t=16, we must be on y=1 to avoid collision, but if we go directly up, we are on y=3 or something at t=16.\n\nSuppose we do something else.\n\nAt t=15, D to y=1 at t=16.\n\nThen from t=16, y=1, we need to reach y=9 at say t=22 or earlier.\n\ny_{15+H} =9.\n\nWith H=8, y_{23}=9.\n\ny_23 = y_15 + sum_{t=15}^{22} Δy_t = 2 + sum =9, so sum_{t=15}^{22} Δy_t =7.\n\n8 actions, sum Δy=7, so one action must be S or D.\n\nSimilarly, with H=9, we had 9 actions, sum=7, so two non-U actions.\n\nIn our sequence, we had one D and eight U? t=15 to t=23 actions: 9 actions.\n\nt=15: D, Δy=-1\n\nt=16 to t=23: all U, Δy=+1 each, 8 actions, +8\n\nBut y_start=2, after t=15 D, y=1, then after 8 U, y=1+8=9, yes.\n\nSum Δy: t=15: -1, t=16 to23: +8, total +7, yes.\n\nNow for H=8, y_{23}=9.\n\nActions from t=15 to t=22, 8 actions.\n\ny_{23} = y_15 + sum_{t=15}^{22} Δy_t = 2 + sum =9, so sum=7.\n\nThus 8 actions, sum Δy=7, so seven U and one other, which must be S, since if D, sum less.\n\nSo one S and seven U.\n\nBut where to put the S.\n\nNow, we must start with D at t=15 to avoid collision at t=16.\n\nAt t=15, action must be D, so y_{16}=1.\n\nThen at t=16, y=1.\n\nNow from there, with 7 actions to reach y=9 at t=23? Actions t=16 to t=22 determine y_{17} to y_{23}.\n\ny_{17} to y_{23} with actions at t=16 to t=22.\n\ny_{16}=1, y_{23}=9, so need net +8 with 7 actions, so all must be U, no S possible? Contradiction.\n\ny_{23} = y_{16} + sum_{t=16}^{22} Δy_t\n\ny_{16}=1, y_{23}=9, so sum_{t=16}^{22} Δy_t =8.\n\nWith 7 actions (t=16 to t=22), each Δy <=1, so max y_{23}=1+7=8, cannot reach 9.\n\ny_{16}=1, after action a_{16}, y_{17} = y_{16} + Δy_{16}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{22}, y_{23} = y_{22} + Δy_{22}\n\nSo with actions from t=16 to t=22, we set y_{17} to y_{23}.\n\ny_{23} = y_{16} + sum_{k=16}^{22} Δy_k\n\nSince y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so y_{23} = y_{16} + Δy_{16} + Δy_{17} + ... + Δy_{22}\n\nYes, 7 terms.\n\ny_{16}=1, y_{23}=9, so sum_{t=16}^{22} Δy_t =8.\n\nBut each Δy_t <=1, so maximum sum is 7, cannot be 8. Impossible.\n\nTherefore, with H=8, it is impossible to reach y=9 at t=23.\n\nBecause after the necessary down at start, we are at y=1 at t=16, and from there to y=9 requires at least 8 up moves, taking to t=24.\n\ny_{16}=1\n\nIf all U: a_{16} U, y_{17}=2\n\na_{17} U, y_{18}=3\n\n...\n\nup to a_{23} U, y_{24}=9\n\nThat's 8 actions from t=16 to t=23, to reach at t=24.\n\nWith S or D, it would be later.\n\nSo minimal to reach from y=1 is 8 actions to y=9 at t=24.\n\nBut we started from t=16.\n\nIn the sequence, we have action at t=15 D, then actions t=16 to t=23 U, reach at t=24.\n\nTotal actions: t=15 to t=23, 9 actions.\n\nIf we can avoid the initial down, but we can't because of t=16 unsafe for y=2,3,4,5.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=0.\n\nFor example, at t=15, D to y=1 at t=16.\n\nThen at t=16, instead of U, go D to y=0 at t=17.\n\nThen from y=0 at t=17, go up.\n\nBut y=0 to y=9, need 9 up moves, to reach at t=26 or later, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nAt t=15, if we go S, but y_{16}=2, unsafe at t=16.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo indeed, we must go down to y=1 at t=16, and then up from there.\n\nThus minimal H is 9.\n\nBut in the up path, we have y=6 unsafe at t=18,19, but in our sequence, we are on y=6 at t=21, which is safe, no issue.\n\ny=7 and 8 unsafe later, but we pass before t=26.\n\nt=22 and t=23 are before 26.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster through other paths, but since we have to avoid t=16, and y=6 unsafe only at t=18,19, but we are later.\n\nAnother thought: after going down to y=1 at t=16, can we go up faster? But we need to cover the distance.\n\nUnless we can skip some levels, but we must move one y at a time.\n\nSo I think H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nWe need to output the sequence of actions from turn t_1=15.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 15: D\n\nThen as above.\n\nIn the sequence I have:\n\nTurn 15: D\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nAnd at turn 24, position (0,9).\n\nH=9 turns? From t=15 to t=23 actions, H actions, y_{t_1 + H} = y_{15+9} = y_{24} =9.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, t=15 to t=23, that's 9 actions.\n\nNow, but in the output, it should be for turns starting from t_1.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSo for H actions, up to turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nHere t_1=15, H=9, so actions from turn 15 to turn 23.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =15+9-1=23.\n\nYes.\n\nActions: as above.\n\nBut let's write them.\n\nTurn 15: D\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 18, we are going to y=4? Let's list the positions to confirm.\n\nt=15: position y=2\n\nAction D: so y_{16} = y_{15} + (-1) =2-1=1\n\nt=16: position y=1, action U, y_{17}=1+1=2\n\nt=17: y=2, action U, y_{18}=3\n\nt=18: y=3, action U, y_{19}=4\n\nt=19: y=4, action U, y_{20}=5\n\nt=20: y=5, action U, y_{21}=6\n\nt=21: y=6, action U, y_{22}=7\n\nt=22: y=7, action U, y_{23}=8\n\nt=23: y=8, action U, y_{24}=9\n\nAt t=24, y=9.\n\nNow, all safe as previously checked.\n\nSpecifically, at t=18, y=3, freeway 3: at T=18, ΔT=3, span for cars: first car [-23 +12*3, -12+12*3]=[-23+36,-12+36]=[13,24], 0 not in; second [49+36,60+36]=[85,96], no. Safe.\n\nt=19, y=4: freeway 4, left-moving, at ΔT=4, [12-36*4,47-36*4]=[12-144,47-144]=[-132,-97], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nt=21, y=6: as before, safe.\n\nt=22, y=7: safe.\n\nt=23, y=8: safe.\n\nNo issues.\n\nCould we have a sequence with stay to avoid something, but not necessary and would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if we stay at some point, H would be larger.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nBut earlier I thought about H=8 impossible.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 is unsafe at t=18,19, but in our path, we are not there at those times.\n\nPerhaps go up slower or faster, but we have to deal with t=16 first.\n\nSuppose at t=15, we go down to y=1.\n\nThen at t=16, we go up to y=2 at t=17.\n\nBut at t=17, y=2 safe.\n\nNow, instead of going straight up, suppose we go up to y=3 at t=18.\n\nAt t=18, y=3 safe, as before.\n\nBut y=6 unsafe at t=18,19.\n\nIf we go directly, at t=20 we are at y=5, t=21 y=6.\n\nt=21 y=6 safe.\n\nIf we want to be at y=6 later or earlier.\n\nAt t=19, y=6 is unsafe, but we are not there.\n\nt=18 unsafe for y=6, but we are on y=3.\n\nSo no need.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier by not going down, but impossible.\n\nSo I think H=9 is minimal.\n\nNow, the sequence is clear.\n\nBut in the output, we need to write it.\n\nAlso, for the car on freeway 7 and 8, unsafe later, but we pass before, so fine.\n\nNow, the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 15: D \\\\ Turn 16: U \\\\ Turn 17: U \\\\ Turn 18: U \\\\ Turn 19: U \\\\ Turn 20: U \\\\ Turn 21: U \\\\ Turn 22: U \\\\ Turn 23: U }\n\nIn the sequence, from turn 17 to 23, all U, but turn 16 is also U except turn 15 D.\n\nIn the box.\n\nSince t_1=15, we write Turn 15: D, Turn 16: U, etc.\n\nUp to Turn 23: U.\n\nNow, H=9.\n\nBut let me confirm if we can start with U at some point, but no.\n\nAnother thought: at t=15, if we go U, y_{16}=3, but unsafe, so not.\n\nPerhaps go to y=0, but worse.\n\nSo yes.\n\nThus the minimal sequence.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 15\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Unsafe Freeway Times\n- Freeway 1 (y=1): Unsafe only at turn 15.\n- Freeway 2 (y=2): Unsafe only at turn 16.\n- Freeway 3 (y=3): Unsafe only at turn 16.\n- Freeway 4 (y=4): Unsafe only at turn 16.\n- Freeway 5 (y=5): Unsafe only at turn 16.\n- Freeway 6 (y=6): Unsafe at turns 18 and 19.\n- Freeway 7 (y=7): Unsafe at turns 26, 27, and 28.\n- Freeway 8 (y=8): Unsafe at turns 26, 27, 28, and 29.\n- Positions y=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nAt turn 15, the player is at y=2, which is safe (since freeway 2 is unsafe only at turn 16). However, at turn 16, freeways y=2, y=3, y=4, and y=5 are all unsafe. Therefore, the only safe action at turn 15 is to move down (D) to y=1 at turn 16, as freeway 1 is safe at turn 16.\n\nFrom y=1 at turn 16, the player can move up (U) repeatedly to reach y=9. The path avoids all unsafe times:\n- Freeways 2, 3, 4, and 5 are safe after turn 16.\n- Freeway 6 is safe at turn 21 (not 18 or 19).\n- Freeways 7 and 8 are safe at turns 22 and 23 (before 26).\n\nThe sequence requires 9 turns (actions from turn 15 to turn 23) to reach y=9 at turn 24. A sequence with fewer turns (e.g., H=8) is impossible because:\n- The necessary down move at turn 15 places the player at y=1 at turn 16.\n- From y=1, reaching y=9 requires at least 8 up moves, reaching y=9 at turn 24 (after actions from turn 16 to turn 23).\n\n### Minimal Action Sequence\n- Turn 15: D – Move down to y=1 at turn 16 (safe, as freeway 1 is safe at turn 16).\n- Turn 16: U – Move up to y=2 at turn 17 (freeway 2 safe at turn 17).\n- Turn 17: U – Move up to y=3 at turn 18 (freeway 3 safe at turn 18).\n- Turn 18: U – Move up to y=4 at turn 19 (freeway 4 safe at turn 19).\n- Turn 19: U – Move up to y=5 at turn 20 (freeway 5 safe at turn 20).\n- Turn 20: U – Move up to y=6 at turn 21 (freeway 6 safe at turn 21).\n- Turn 21: U – Move up to y=7 at turn 22 (freeway 7 safe at turn 22).\n- Turn 22: U – Move up to y=8 at turn 23 (freeway 8 safe at turn 23).\n- Turn 23: U – Move up to y=9 at turn 24 (goal reached, y=9 safe).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in 9 turns with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{ U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,1) at turn t1=16 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y at that turn, and for some car on that freeway, the x-position 0 is within the car's span at that turn. The car spans move left or right based on their direction and speed.\n\nThe key point is that when you move to a new y-position, you're not on that new row until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, you're still on y at turn T, and you arrive at y+1 at turn T+1. Therefore, you only need to worry about collisions on the row you're currently on at each turn.\n\nNow, let's list the car states for each freeway at turn t1=16. I need to find where the cars will be at future turns relative to t1.\n\nThe car update is given for T > t1, with Span(T) = [head - s*(T-t1), tail - s*(T-t1)] for left-moving, or [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)] for right-moving. Direction: left or right.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Freeway 1: (48, 1, right, 48)\n\n  This is one car: head=48, tail=1, direction=right, speed=48.\n\n  Since it's right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] = [1 + 48*(T-16), 48 + 48*(T-16)]\n\n  But tail is 1, head is 48, so for right-moving, the head is at the front, so when moving right, the span increases: [tail + s*dt, head + s*dt] where dt = T - t1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlso, collision if 0 is in Span(T) for that freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, for freeway k, we care when the player is on y=k at turn T.\n\nPlayer starts at y=1 at t=16.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nSince we want minimal turns, probably want to go up as much as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, let's understand where the cars are and when they block x=0.\n\nDefine dt = T - 16, so at turn T = 16 + dt.\n\nFor each freeway, find when 0 is covered by a car.\n\nStart with freeway 1 (y=1):\n\nCar: (h=48, τ=1, d=right, s=48)\n\nRight-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt] = [1 + 48*dt, 48 + 48*dt]\n\n0 is in this span if 1 + 48*dt ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 48*dt\n\nBut 1 + 48*dt > 0 for dt ≥ 0, since dt integer, T>t1, so dt ≥1? T is future turn, so dt ≥0? Turn T, at T=16, we have the state, but for collision at T, we need Span at T.\n\nThe state is given at t1=16, so for turn T=16, we know the span.\n\nBut collision is checked at each turn when player is on that row.\n\nAt turn T=16, player is on y=1.\n\nFor freeway 1 at T=16: dt=0, Span(16) = [1 + 48*0, 48 + 48*0] = [1,48]\n\n0 is not in [1,48], so no collision at T=16 on y=1.\n\nNow for future T=16+dt, Span(T) = [1 + 48*dt, 48 + 48*dt]\n\nSince 1 + 48*dt > 0 for all dt ≥0, 0 is always less than the left end, so 0 is never in this span. So freeway 1 never blocks x=0. Safe to be on y=1 at any time.\n\n1 + 48*dt ≥1 >0, so min span is 1, so 0 not covered. Yes.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nSecond car: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nBoth right-moving, speed 12.\n\nFor first car: h=0, τ=-11? Head and tail.\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, span is [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt] = [-11 + 12*dt, 0 + 12*dt]\n\nAt dt=0, T=16, span = [-11,0]\n\n0 is included? -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, yes, 0 is in [-11,0].\n\nBut at T=16, player is on y=1, not y=2, so for freeway 2, we care when player is on y=2.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-48, -59, right, 12), so τ=-59? Head and tail.\n\nGiven as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for this, head=-48, tail=-59? That seems odd because usually head > tail for right-moving, but let's see.\n\nDirection right, so span should be [tail + s*dt, head + s*dt] = [-59 + 12*dt, -48 + 12*dt]\n\nAt dt=0, [-59,-48], 0 not in it.\n\nNow for freeway 2, we have two cars. Collision if 0 in span of either car at turn T.\n\nFirst car: span [ -11 + 12*dt , 0 + 12*dt ] = [ -11 + 12dt , 12dt ]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 12dt ≤ 0 ≤ 12dt\n\nWhich implies 0 ≤ 12dt and -11 + 12dt ≤ 0\n\nSo 12dt ≥ 0 always for dt≥0, and -11 + 12dt ≤ 0 ⇒ 12dt ≤ 11 ⇒ dt ≤ 11/12, but dt integer, so dt=0.\n\ndt=0:  -11 + 0 = -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, yes 0≤0.\n\ndt=1: -11+12=1 ≤0? 1 ≤0 false, and 0≤12, but 1 ≤0 false, so not satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, only at dt=0, 0 is in [ -11, 0 ].\n\nBut at dt=0, T=16, and player is not on y=2 at T=16, so no issue.\n\nFor dt>0, 12dt ≥12 >0, so 0 not in [something positive, something larger].\n\n-11 +12dt, at dt=0: -11, dt=1:1, dt=2:13, etc. So for dt=0, span [ -11,0], contains 0.\n\nFor dt=1, [1,12], min=1>0, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for larger dt.\n\nNow second car: [ -59 +12dt, -48 +12dt ]\n\n-59+12dt ≤ -48+12dt, and both negative for small dt.\n\n0 in span if -59+12dt ≤ 0 ≤ -48+12dt\n\nBut -48+12dt ≤0 for small dt, and ≥0 for large.\n\n-48+12dt ≤0 ⇒ 12dt ≤48 ⇒ dt≤4\n\n-48+12dt ≥0 ⇒ dt≥4\n\nSimilarly, -59+12dt ≤0 ⇒ 12dt≤59 ⇒ dt≤4.916, so dt≤4\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -48+12dt only if -48+12dt ≥0, dt≥4\n\nSo for dt=4: -59+48= -11? dt=4, -59+12*4= -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, so span [-11,0], contains 0.\n\nFor dt=3: -59+36= -23, -48+36= -12, span [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\ndt=4: [-11,0], contains 0.\n\ndt=5: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo second car blocks at dt=4.\n\nBut for freeway 2, collision when 0 in either car.\n\nFirst car blocks only at dt=0.\n\nSecond car blocks at dt=4.\n\nSo at T=16+dt, on y=2, collision if dt=0 or dt=4.\n\nBut dt=0 is T=16, not relevant for future unless player is there.\n\nNow for player, when on y=2, need to avoid when dt=4, i.e., T=20.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Cars: (0, -11, right, 12), (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nExactly the same as freeway 2. So same thing, collision on y=3 at T=20 (dt=4).\n\nNow freeway 4: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nOne car, direction left.\n\nLeft-moving: Span(T) = [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt] = [-24 -36*dt, 11 -36*dt]\n\nHead and tail: given (-24,11, left,36), so h=-24, τ=11? But for left-moving, head should be the front when moving left.\n\nDirection left, so car moving left, so at time T, span [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt]\n\nh=-24, τ=11, but if moving left, and h=-24, τ=11, that might imply the tail is at higher x, but let's compute.\n\nSpan(T) = [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt] = [-24 -36*dt, 11 -36*dt]\n\n0 in span if -24 -36dt ≤ 0 ≤ 11 -36dt\n\nNow, left inequality: -24 -36dt ≤ 0 ⇒ -36dt ≤ 24 ⇒ multiply by -1, reverse inequality, 36dt ≥ -24, always true since dt≥0.\n\nRight inequality: 0 ≤ 11 -36dt ⇒ 36dt ≤ 11 ⇒ dt ≤ 11/36 <1, so dt=0.\n\nAt dt=0: span [-24,11], -24≤0≤11, yes 0 in.\n\nFor dt=1: [-24-36, 11-36] = [-60,-25], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at dt=0, T=16, collision possible on y=4, but player not there.\n\nFor future, no collision on y=4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as freeway 4? (-24,11,left,36), identical. So same, only collision at dt=0, not future.\n\nNow freeway 6: (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nOne car, direction right.\n\nh=-12, τ=-23? Given (head,tail,dir,speed)= (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nRight-moving, so span [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt] = [-23 +6*dt, -12 +6*dt]\n\n0 in span if -23 +6dt ≤ 0 ≤ -12 +6dt\n\nLeft: -23 +6dt ≤ 0 ⇒ 6dt ≤ 23 ⇒ dt ≤ 23/6 ≈ 3.833, so dt≤3\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -12 +6dt ⇒ 6dt ≥12 ⇒ dt ≥2\n\nSo for dt=2: -23+12= -11, -12+12=0, span [-11,0], contains 0.\n\ndt=3: -23+18= -5, -12+18=6, span [-5,6], contains 0.\n\ndt=4: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo blocks at dt=2 and dt=3, i.e., T=18 and T=19.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst: (-40,-51,right,4)\n\nSecond: (24,13,right,4) head=24, tail=13? For right-moving, if head=24, tail=13, that might be fine, span increasing.\n\nFirst car: (-40,-51,right,4) so τ=-51, h=-40? Span [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt] = [-51 +4*dt, -40 +4*dt]\n\n0 in span if -51 +4dt ≤ 0 ≤ -40 +4dt\n\nLeft: -51 +4dt ≤ 0 ⇒ 4dt ≤51 ⇒ dt ≤12.75, dt≤12\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -40 +4dt ⇒ 4dt ≥40 ⇒ dt≥10\n\nSo for dt=10: -51+40= -11, -40+40=0, [-11,0], contains 0.\n\ndt=11: -51+44= -7, -40+44=4, [-7,4], contains 0.\n\ndt=12: -51+48= -3, -40+48=8, [-3,8], contains 0.\n\ndt=13: -51+52=1, -40+52=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo blocks at dt=10,11,12.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,4) head=24, tail=13, right-moving.\n\nSpan [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt] = [13 +4*dt, 24 +4*dt]\n\nSince τ=13, h=24, so [13+4dt, 24+4dt], min at least 13>0, so 0 never in, always positive. So no issue.\n\nThus for freeway 7, only first car matters, blocks at dt=10,11,12, T=26,27,28.\n\nT=16+dt, so T=26,27,28.\n\nNow freeway 8: (-30,-41,right,3)\n\nOne car, right-moving, head=-30? τ=-41?\n\nSpan [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt] = [-41 +3*dt, -30 +3*dt]\n\n0 in span if -41 +3dt ≤ 0 ≤ -30 +3dt\n\nLeft: -41 +3dt ≤ 0 ⇒ 3dt ≤41 ⇒ dt≤13.666, dt≤13\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -30 +3dt ⇒ 3dt ≥30 ⇒ dt≥10\n\nSo for dt=10: -41+30= -11, -30+30=0, [-11,0], contains 0.\n\ndt=11: -41+33= -8, -30+33=3, [-8,3], contains 0.\n\ndt=12: -41+36= -5, -30+36=6, [-5,6], contains 0.\n\ndt=13: -41+39= -2, -30+39=9, [-2,9], contains 0.\n\ndt=14: -41+42=1, -30+42=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo blocks at dt=10,11,12,13, T=26,27,28,29.\n\nNow summarize the dangerous times for each row:\n\n- y=1: no danger, as we saw earlier.\n\n- y=2: dangerous at T=20 (dt=4)\n\n- y=3: dangerous at T=20 (dt=4)\n\n- y=4: no danger\n\n- y=5: no danger (same as y=4)\n\n- y=6: dangerous at T=18 and T=19 (dt=2,3)\n\n- y=7: dangerous at T=26,27,28\n\n- y=8: dangerous at T=26,27,28,29\n\nPlayer starts at y=1, t=16.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, since cars only on y=1 to 8, so once at y=9, no collision, and we need to be at (0,9) for the position, but since x=0 always, I assume.\n\nThe grid is x and y, but player is always at x=0, I think, since moving vertically only, and cars are on horizontal freeways.\n\nSo position (0,y_t).\n\nNow, to minimize turns, we want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nPlayer can move U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0 per turn.\n\nStart at t=16, y=1.\n\nWe need to get to y=9, which is 8 steps up.\n\nBut we can't always go up if there is a collision risk.\n\nAlso, we might need to wait or go down to avoid.\n\nBut since we want minimal H, we should go up when possible.\n\nFirst, from y=1 to y=2: we can move at t=16 to y=2? At t=16, we are at y=1. We choose action at t=16 to go to next y.\n\nLet me denote the turn and position.\n\nAt turn t, we are at position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nAnd at turn t, we are on y_t, so collision check on row y_t at turn t.\n\nThen we move to y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nStart: t=16, y=1.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn, say t=16+H, but we need the sequence from t=16 to t=16+H-1 to reach y=16+H =9.\n\nSet t_start = 16.\n\ny_{t} at turn t.\n\ny_{16} =1.\n\nAfter actions a_{16}, a_{17}, ..., a_{16+H-1}, we have y_{16+H} =9.\n\nAnd H minimal.\n\nNow, the actions are chosen from t=16 onwards.\n\nFirst, at t=16, on y=1, which is safe, as we saw.\n\nWe can choose to stay, go up, or down, but down to y=0 might be ok, but we want to go up, so probably go up to y=2.\n\nBut y=2 is dangerous at T=20.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 dangerous at T=20.\n\nBut T=20 is future.\n\nNow, let's see the times.\n\nCurrent t=16.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal time is if we go up every turn: from y=1 to y=9, need 8 up moves, so in 8 turns, at t=24, y=9.\n\nt=16: y=1\n\nAfter a_{16}: if U, y_{17}=2\n\nThen a_{17}: U, y_{18}=3\n\n...\n\nAfter 8 U moves: at t=24, y=9.\n\nBut we need to check for collisions during the path.\n\nAt each turn, when on a row, check if collision.\n\nStart t=16, on y=1: safe, as established.\n\nNow, if we go U at t=16, then at t=17, we are on y=2.\n\nt=17: dt = t -16 =1\n\nOn y=2, is it dangerous? For y=2, dangerous only at T=20, dt=4.\n\nt=17, dt=1, not 4, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=17, on y=2, safe.\n\nThen go U to y=3 at t=18.\n\nt=18, on y=3, dt=2.\n\ny=3 dangerous at T=20, dt=4, not now, so safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 at t=19.\n\nt=19, on y=4, which has no danger, safe.\n\nThen U to y=5 at t=20.\n\nt=20, on y=5, no danger, safe.\n\nBut y=5 is safe, as per earlier.\n\nThen U to y=6 at t=21.\n\nt=21, on y=6, dt=5.\n\ny=6 dangerous at T=18 and 19, dt=2 and 3.\n\nt=21, dt=5, not 2 or 3, so safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at t=22.\n\nt=22, on y=7, dt=6.\n\ny=7 dangerous at T=26,27,28, dt=10,11,12.\n\ndt=6 <10, not dangerous, safe.\n\nThen U to y=8 at t=23.\n\nt=23, on y=8, dt=7.\n\ny=8 dangerous at T=26,27,28,29, dt=10,11,12,13.\n\ndt=7<10, safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at t=24.\n\nt=24, on y=9, but y=9 has no cars, so no collision, and position (0,9) reached.\n\nIn this path, all turns are safe? Let's list:\n\nt=16: y=1, safe\n\nt=17: y=2, dt=1, not T=20, safe\n\nt=18: y=3, dt=2, not T=20 (dt=4), safe\n\nt=19: y=4, safe\n\nt=20: y=5, safe\n\nt=21: y=6, dt=5, not 2 or 3, safe\n\nt=22: y=7, dt=6, not 10-12, safe\n\nt=23: y=8, dt=7, not 10-13, safe\n\nt=24: y=9, safe\n\nAnd we reached at t=24.\n\nH is the number of actions? From t=16 to t=16+H-1, with y_{16+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, actions from t=16 to t=23, that's 8 actions: a16 to a23, each U, and at t=24, y=9.\n\nt=16: after action, y17=2? Let's clarify indices.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nWe need y_{t_start + H} =9, with t_start=16.\n\nActions from t=16 to t=16+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we reach turn 16+H.\n\nIn the sequence: start t=16, y=1.\n\nAfter a16, y17 = y16 + Δy\n\nAt t=17, y= y17, and so on.\n\nWe need y_{16+H} =9.\n\nIn minimal path, H=8, y_{24}=9.\n\nAnd we have actions at t=16 to t=23.\n\nIn the path above, all positions during the moves are safe, as listed.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nAt t=18, we are on y=3, which is safe since dt=2 ≠4.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at t=21, dt=5, not 2 or 3, safe.\n\nBut earlier for y=6, dangerous at dt=2 and 3, which are t=18 and 19.\n\nAt t=18, if we were on y=6, it would be dangerous, but in this path, at t=18, we are on y=3, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=19, on y=4.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nSimilarly, later times for y=7 and y=8, dangerous at dt=10-13, t=26-29, which are later than t=24.\n\nSo in this case, we can reach in 8 turns with all U.\n\nBut the player starts at y=1, and we go directly to y=9 in 8 turns.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on y=6 at t=18 and t=19.\n\nFor example, at t=18, dt=2, on y=6: freeway 6 car span: [-23 +6*2, -12 +6*2] = [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], which includes 0, so if on y=6 at t=18, collision.\n\nBut in our path, at t=18, we are on y=3, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=19, y=6 span: [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6], includes 0, but we are on y=4.\n\nSafe.\n\nNow, is there any reason we cannot do this? Seems fine.\n\nBut let me check if we need to start immediately.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster? From y=1 to y=9, minimum 8 moves up, so H=8 is minimal possible, since each move changes y by at most 1.\n\nUnless we can skip, but no, y integer, so at least 8 up moves needed, so H=8 is minimal.\n\nAnd we have a path with H=8.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nBut let me see if at t=20, when we are on y=5, but y=2 and y=3 are dangerous at t=20.\n\nBut we are not on them.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=16: y=1, action U to y=2\n\nt=17: y=2, action U to y=3\n\nt=18: y=3, action U to y=4\n\nt=19: y=4, action U to y=5\n\nt=20: y=5, action U to y=6\n\nt=21: y=6, action U to y=7\n\nt=22: y=7, action U to y=8\n\nt=23: y=8, action U to y=9\n\nAt t=24, y=9.\n\nNow, at each turn, the row we are on:\n\nt=16: y=1, safe\n\nt=17: y=2, dt=1, not dangerous time (danger at dt=4)\n\nt=18: y=3, dt=2, not dangerous (danger at dt=4)\n\nt=19: y=4, safe\n\nt=20: y=5, safe\n\nt=21: y=6, dt=5, not dangerous (danger at dt=2,3)\n\nt=22: y=7, dt=6, not dangerous (danger dt=10,11,12)\n\nt=23: y=8, dt=7, not dangerous (danger dt=10,11,12,13)\n\nAll good.\n\nBut for y=2, dangerous only at dt=4, t=20.\n\nAt t=20, if we were on y=2, it would be dangerous, but in this path, at t=20, we are on y=5.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do at t=24.\n\nNow, H=8, actions: all U from t=16 to t=23.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  which is U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 +7: U\n\nt_1=16, so turns 16 to 23.\n\nBut H=8, from t=0 to H-1, t=16 to 16+7=23.\n\nIn the sequence, t from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nNow, but let me double-check if at any point there is a collision.\n\nFor example, when we move to a new row, we are not on it until next turn, so no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm the car states quickly.\n\nAt t=17, on y=2, dt=1, span of car on y=2: first car, [ -11 +12*1, 12*1] = [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car, [ -59 +12*1, -48+12*1] = [-47,-36], not 0.\n\nSafe.\n\nt=18, on y=3, similarly, same as y=2, since freeway 3 same, dt=2, [ -11+24, 24]? First car: [ -11+12*2, 12*2] = [-11+24,24] = [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24], no.\n\nt=19, y=4, no cars or safe, span: for left-moving, at dt=3, but we said only dt=0 dangerous, so [-24-36*3,11-36*3] = [-24-108,11-108] = [-132,-97], no 0.\n\nt=20, y=5, similarly.\n\nt=21, y=6, dt=5, span: [-23+6*5, -12+6*5] = [-23+30, -12+30] = [7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=22, y=7, dt=6, the dangerous car: [-51+4*6, -40+4*6] = [-51+24, -40+24] = [-27,-16], 0 not in, and other car not relevant.\n\nt=23, y=8, dt=7, span: [-41+3*7, -30+3*7] = [-41+21, -30+21] = [-20,-9], no 0.\n\nAll safe.\n\nSo this works with H=8.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,1), and we go directly up.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 2 and 3, there is a car at T=20, but we avoid by being elsewhere.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster, but 8 is minimum.\n\nBut what if we go down first? No need, since we can go up directly.\n\nPerhaps at some point we need to wait, but here not necessary.\n\nBut let me see the freeway 6, dangerous at t=18 and 19.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=6 at t=21, which is safe.\n\nIf we were faster, but we can't be on y=6 earlier than t=21 if starting from y=1 at t=16.\n\nTo be on y=6 at turn t, we need at least t-16 steps up, but since we start at y=1, to reach y=6, need 5 up moves, so earliest at t=21 if we go directly.\n\nAt t=16: y=1\n\nAfter 5 U moves: at t=21, y=6.\n\nIf we go all U: t=16: y1, a16 U, t=17 y2, a17 U, t=18 y3, a18 U, t=19 y4, a19 U, t=20 y5, a20 U, t=21 y6.\n\nSo at t=21, y=6.\n\nDangerous at t=18 and 19 for y=6, but t=21 is later, safe.\n\nSimilarly, we reach y=9 at t=24.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier by going down? No, going down would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=0, then we need to go up to 9, 9 moves, worse.\n\nOr if we stay, delays.\n\nSo H=8 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 8 turns.\n\nNow, in the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nThen at turn 24, position (0,9).\n\nH=8.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbering.\n\nt1=16.\n\nActions from t=16 to t=16+H-1.\n\nH=8, so t=16 to 23.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nWe have H=8.\n\nBut is there a way with H=7? No, because from y=1 to y=9, need to increase by 8, each action changes by at most 1, so at least 8 actions needed. So H=8 is minimal.\n\nThus, this should be it.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 1, it was safe, but we didn't use it much.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we need to avoid something else.\n\nAnother thing: when moving, if we move to a row that will be dangerous, but since we arrive at next turn, and we are on current row, it should be fine.\n\nFor example, at t=19, we are on y=4, and we move U to y=5, so at t=20, we are on y=5.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, dangerous at t=26-29, but we are at t=23, safe.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all Up actions.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 16: U \\\\ Turn 17: U \\\\ Turn 18: U \\\\ Turn 19: U \\\\ Turn 20: U \\\\ Turn 21: U \\\\ Turn 22: U \\\\ Turn 23: U }\n\nWith H=8.\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so for t1=16.\n\nPerhaps write it as:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 23: U\n\nAnd since H=8, it's from t=16 to 23.\n\nNow, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 16\\) is 8. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) at every turn from \\(t = 16\\) to \\(t = 23\\), resulting in the player reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t = 24\\).\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance:\n- At each turn, the player is on a row \\(y_t\\), and collision is checked only if \\(0\\) is in the span of any car on that row at turn \\(t\\).\n- The dangerous times for each row (when \\(0\\) is in a car's span) are:\n  - \\(y = 2\\): dangerous at \\(t = 20\\) (\\(dt = 4\\))\n  - \\(y = 3\\): dangerous at \\(t = 20\\) (\\(dt = 4\\))\n  - \\(y = 6\\): dangerous at \\(t = 18\\) and \\(t = 19\\) (\\(dt = 2, 3\\))\n  - \\(y = 7\\): dangerous at \\(t = 26, 27, 28\\) (\\(dt = 10, 11, 12\\))\n  - \\(y = 8\\): dangerous at \\(t = 26, 27, 28, 29\\) (\\(dt = 10, 11, 12, 13\\))\n  - Other rows (\\(y = 1, 4, 5\\)) have no dangerous times, and \\(y = 9\\) has no cars.\n\nThe sequence of positions and actions:\n- Turn 16: Player at \\(y = 1\\) (safe). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 17.\n- Turn 17: Player at \\(y = 2\\), \\(dt = 1\\) (not dangerous at \\(t = 20\\)). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 18.\n- Turn 18: Player at \\(y = 3\\), \\(dt = 2\\) (not dangerous at \\(t = 20\\)). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 19.\n- Turn 19: Player at \\(y = 4\\) (safe). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 20.\n- Turn 20: Player at \\(y = 5\\) (safe). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 21.\n- Turn 21: Player at \\(y = 6\\), \\(dt = 5\\) (not dangerous at \\(t = 18\\) or \\(t = 19\\)). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 22.\n- Turn 22: Player at \\(y = 7\\), \\(dt = 6\\) (not dangerous at \\(t = 26, 27, 28\\)).

Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 24.\n- Turn 24: Player at \\(y = 9\\) (no cars, safe), position \\((0, 9)\\) reached.\n\nThis path achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 8\\) turns, as at least 8 actions are required to increase \\(y\\) from 1 to 9 (each action changes \\(y\\) by at most 1), and all actions are safe.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{ U} }",

I start at turn t_1 = 17, and I need to output the sequence of actions starting from turn 17.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each future turn and how they move. The cars are given at turn 17, and they move with constant speed in their direction.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, right-moving, head 96, tail 49, speed 48. Since it's right-moving, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]. For this car, τ=49, h=96, s=48, t_1=17.\n\nThe car update: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it says (96,49,right,48). I think head and tail are given, but for right-moving, head is the front, so when moving right, head increases.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, it's [tail, head] I think? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update rules:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor left-moving, at t_1, span is [h, τ], and since it's moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving, at t_1, it's given as (head, tail), but in the span, it's written as [τ, h], so I think for right-moving, τ is tail, h is head, and span is from tail to head.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ], so h is head, τ is tail.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (96,49,right,48), so h=96, τ=49, so span at t_1 is [49,96] for right-moving? No.\n\nAccording to the rule: right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\n\nSo for freeway 1, τ=49, h=96, so span at t_1 is [49,96], meaning from 49 to 96.\n\nAt time T, span is [49 + 48(T-17), 96 + 48(T-17)]\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on that freeway, i.e., y_T = k, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe player position at turn T is y_T, and we care about the cars on row y_T at turn T.\n\nIf the player moves to a different row, they are not on that row until the next turn.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, only at T+1 if you are there.\n\nAt turn T, you are on row y_T, and you check cars on row y_T at time T for collision.\n\nThen you choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nIf a_T is U or D, y_{T+1} = y_T +1 or -1, so you move to a new row at turn T+1.\n\nIf a_T is S, you stay on the same row.\n\nCollision only when you are on a freeway row at that turn and 0 is in some car's span on that row at that turn.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is the starting point, and y=9 is the goal, both have no cars.\n\nThe player starts at (0,2), so at turn 17, y=2.\n\ny=2 is a freeway, row 2, so there might be cars.\n\nFreeway 2 has cars.\n\nLet me list all cars for each row at turn 17.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): one car: right-moving, τ=49, h=96, s=48, span at T: [49 + 48(T-17), 96 + 48(T-17)]\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): two cars: (12,1,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nFirst car: τ=1, h=12, s=12, right, span at T: [1 + 12(T-17), 12 + 12(T-17)]\n\nSecond car: τ=-47, h=-36, s=12, right, span at T: [-47 + 12(T-17), -36 + 12(T-17)]\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): same as freeway 2? (12,1,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12), identical to y=2? That can't be right, or is it?\n\nThe table says for freeway 3: (12,1,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12), same as freeway 2.\n\nProbably different rows have different cars.\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nLeft-moving, so for left-moving, span at t_1 is [h, τ] = [-60, -25]? h and τ.\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nHere h=-60, τ=-25, s=36, so span at T: [-60 - 36(T-17), -25 - 36(T-17)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 (y=5): same as y=4, (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nRight-moving, τ=-17, h=-6, s=6, span at T: [-17 + 6(T-17), -6 + 6(T-17)]\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): two cars, (-36,-47,right,4) and (28,17,right,4)\n\nFirst: τ=-47, h=-36, s=4, right, span at T: [-47 + 4(T-17), -36 + 4(T-17)]\n\nSecond: τ=17, h=28, s=4, right, span at T: [17 + 4(T-17), 28 + 4(T-17)]\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): (-27,-38,right,3)\n\nτ=-38, h=-27, s=3, right, span at T: [-38 + 3(T-17), -27 + 3(T-17)]\n\nNow, the player starts at y=2 at turn 17.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is above, so I probably want to move up as much as possible, but I have to avoid the cars when I'm on the freeway rows.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, I can stay there, but I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since I start at y=2, and need to go to y=9, that's 7 steps up, so at least 7 turns if I go up every turn, but I might have to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nBut going down might not be efficient, so I should try to go up directly if possible.\n\nFirst, let's see if I can go up from y=2 at turn 17.\n\nBut at turn 17, I'm on y=2, so I need to check if at turn 17, on y=2, is there a collision? Collision if 0 is in the span of some car on y=2 at turn 17.\n\nAt turn 17, T=17, so for each car, span at T=17.\n\nFor freeway 2, first car: span [1 +12(0), 12+12(0)] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSecond car: [-47 +0, -36+0] = [-47,-36], 0 not in [-47,-36], so no collision at turn 17 on y=2.\n\nGood, I can start.\n\nNow, I need to choose action at turn 17: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go up, to y=3 at turn 18.\n\nIf I go down, to y=1, or stay on y=2.\n\nSince I want to go up, U is better.\n\nBut I need to see the future.\n\nSimilarly, at each turn, when I'm on a freeway, I need to ensure 0 not in car span.\n\nAlso, when I move, at the turn I arrive, I need to check.\n\nLet me denote time t = t_1 + delta = 17 + delta, where delta = T - t_1.\n\nSet delta = T - 17, so at delta=0, turn 17.\n\nThen for each car, span at delta:\n\nFreeway 1: right, span [49 + 48*delta, 96 + 48*delta]\n\nFreeway 2: car1: [1 + 12*delta, 12 + 12*delta]\n\ncar2: [-47 + 12*delta, -36 + 12*delta]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2, car1: [1 +12*delta, 12+12*delta], car2: [-47+12*delta, -36+12*delta]\n\nFreeway 4: left, h=-60, τ=-25, s=36, span [-60 -36*delta, -25 -36*delta]\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4: [-60 -36*delta, -25 -36*delta]\n\nFreeway 6: right, τ=-17, h=-6, s=6, span [-17 +6*delta, -6 +6*delta]\n\nFreeway 7: car1: [-47 +4*delta, -36 +4*delta]  (right)\n\ncar2: [17 +4*delta, 28 +4*delta]  (right)\n\nFreeway 8: right, τ=-38, h=-27, s=3, span [-38 +3*delta, -27 +3*delta]\n\nCollision on freeway k at time delta if 0 in the span of some car on that row at that time.\n\nSince freeways 2 and 3 have identical cars, same for 4 and 5.\n\nI need to go from y=2 at delta=0 to y=9 asap.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so when I reach y=9, I'm safe, no cars.\n\nThe position is (0,y), so x=0 always.\n\nSo collision only if on y=k for k=1 to 8, and 0 in some car's span on that row.\n\nNow, for each row and time, I can find when 0 is not in the span, meaning it's safe to be on that row at that time.\n\nFor a given row k and time delta, it is safe if for all cars on that row, 0 not in the span.\n\nFor example, row 1: only one car, span [49 +48delta, 96+48delta], so 0 in span if 49+48delta <= 0 <= 96+48delta.\n\nSince 49+48delta >0 for delta>=0, because min at delta=0 is 49>0, so 49+48delta >0 for all delta, so 0 never in [49+48delta,96+48delta] since both ends positive and increasing. So row 1 is always safe! No car can cover 0 because the span starts at 49 and increases.\n\nSimilarly, for row 2, car1: [1+12delta,12+12delta], min at delta=0 is [1,12], all positive, so 0 not in it.\n\nCar2: [-47+12delta, -36+12delta], at delta=0, [-47,-36], both negative, so 0 not in it. Now, when does it cover 0? If -47+12delta <=0 <= -36+12delta? But -36+12delta <=0 when delta <=3, since at delta=3, -36+36=0, at delta=4, -36+48=12>0.\n\n-47+12delta <=0 for delta <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so delta <=3\n\n-36+12delta <=0 for delta <= 36/12=3\n\n-36+12delta <=0 when delta <=3, and >=0 when delta >=3? Let's solve.\n\n-47+12delta <= 0 when 12delta <=47, delta <= 47/12 ≈3.916\n\n-36+12delta <=0 when 12delta <=36, delta <=3\n\n-36+12delta >=0 when delta >=3\n\nSimilarly, -47+12delta <=0 for delta <=3.916, >0 for delta>3.916\n\nNow, 0 in [low, high] if low <=0 and high >=0.\n\nFor car2 on row2: low = -47+12delta, high = -36+12delta\n\n0 in span if low <=0 and high >=0.\n\nlow <=0: -47+12delta <=0 => delta <= 47/12 ≈3.916\n\nhigh >=0: -36+12delta >=0 => delta >= 36/12 =3\n\nSo for delta in [3, 3.916], approximately [3, 47/12]\n\nSince delta integer, delta=3 and delta=4? delta=3: high = -36+36=0, so 0<=0, so 0 is included if the span includes endpoints, which I think it does, since it's a closed interval.\n\nSimilarly, low at delta=3: -47+36= -11 <=0.\n\nAt delta=3: low=-47+36=-11, high=-36+36=0, so [-11,0], 0 in it.\n\nAt delta=4: low=-47+48=1, high=-36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nAt delta=2: low=-47+24=-23, high=-36+24=-12, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nAt delta=3: [-11,0], 0 in, so collision if on row2 at delta=3.\n\nSimilarly, car1 on row2: [1+12delta,12+12delta], always positive, so 0 never in.\n\nSo for row 2, unsafe when car2 covers 0, which is at delta=3, time t=17+3=20.\n\nAt delta=3, only unsafe if on row2.\n\nNow row 3: same as row 2, because same cars, so also unsafe at delta=3.\n\nFreeway 3 has the same cars as freeway 2, so row 3 unsafe at delta=3.\n\nNow row 4: left-moving car, span [-60 -36delta, -25 -36delta]\n\nBoth ends decreasing since left-moving.\n\nAt delta=0, [-60,-25], both negative.\n\n0 in span if low <=0 and high >=0.\n\nlow = -60 -36delta <=0 always true since negative.\n\nhigh = -25 -36delta >=0? -25-36delta >=0 only if -36delta >=25, impossible since delta>=0, so high <0 always, so 0 never in span. Row 4 always safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 5 same, always safe.\n\nRow 6: right-moving, span [-17 +6delta, -6 +6delta]\n\n0 in span if -17+6delta <=0 and -6+6delta >=0\n\n-17+6delta <=0 => 6delta <=17 => delta <= 17/6 ≈2.833\n\n-6+6delta >=0 => 6delta >=6 => delta >=1\n\nSo for delta in [1, 2.833], integer delta=1,2.\n\nAt delta=1: low=-17+6=-11, high=-6+6=0, so [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nAt delta=2: low=-17+12=-5, high=-6+12=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt delta=0: low=-17, high=-6, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nAt delta=3: low=-17+18=1, high=-6+18=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo row 6 unsafe at delta=1 and 2.\n\nRow 7: two cars.\n\nCar1: [-47+4delta, -36+4delta]\n\n0 in if -47+4delta <=0 and -36+4delta >=0\n\n-47+4delta <=0 => 4delta <=47 => delta <=47/4=11.75\n\n-36+4delta >=0 => 4delta >=36 => delta >=9\n\nSo for delta in [9,11.75], integer 9,10,11.\n\nAt delta=9: low=-47+36=-11, high=-36+36=0, [-11,0], 0 in\n\nDelta=10: low=-47+40=-7, high=-36+40=4, [-7,4], 0 in\n\nDelta=11: low=-47+44=-3, high=-36+44=8, [-3,8], 0 in\n\nDelta=12: low=-47+48=1, high=-36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nCar2: [17+4delta, 28+4delta], always positive, min 17>0, so 0 never in.\n\nSo row 7 unsafe when car1 covers 0, at delta=9,10,11.\n\nRow 8: one car, span [-38 +3delta, -27 +3delta]\n\n0 in if -38+3delta <=0 and -27+3delta >=0\n\n-38+3delta <=0 => 3delta <=38 => delta <= 38/3 ≈12.666\n\n-27+3delta >=0 => 3delta >=27 => delta >=9\n\nSo for delta in [9, 12.666], integer 9,10,11,12.\n\nAt delta=9: low=-38+27=-11, high=-27+27=0, [-11,0], 0 in\n\nDelta=10: low=-38+30=-8, high=-27+30=3, [-8,3], 0 in\n\nDelta=11: low=-38+33=-5, high=-27+33=6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nDelta=12: low=-38+36=-2, high=-27+36=9, [-2,9], 0 in\n\nDelta=13: low=-38+39=1, high=-27+39=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo row 8 unsafe at delta=9,10,11,12.\n\nNow, summary of unsafe times for each row:\n\n- Row 1: always safe\n\n- Row 2: unsafe at delta=3 (t=20)\n\n- Row 3: unsafe at delta=3 (t=20) same as row2\n\n- Row 4: always safe\n\n- Row 5: always safe\n\n- Row 6: unsafe at delta=1 (t=18), delta=2 (t=19)\n\n- Row 7: unsafe at delta=9 (t=26),10(t=27),11(t=28)\n\n- Row 8: unsafe at delta=9(t=26),10(t=27),11(t=28),12(t=29)\n\nI start at row 2, delta=0, which is safe.\n\nI need to reach row 9, which is always safe.\n\nThe minimal H: since from row 2 to row 9, I need at least 7 up moves, but I might need to wait or detour.\n\nBut rows 4 and 5 are always safe, so I could go through them.\n\nAlso, row 1 is safe, but row 1 is below, so going down might not help.\n\nI should plan a path upward.\n\nSince I start at row 2, I can go up to row 3, but row 3 is unsafe at delta=3.\n\nDelta=3 is t=20.\n\nNow, let me think in terms of turns from start.\n\nSet t = turn number, starting from t=17.\n\nAt t=17, y=2, safe.\n\nAction a_17: I can choose U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, then at t=18, y=3.\n\nIf D, y=1, or S, y=2.\n\ny=1 is always safe, y=2 at t=17 is safe, but at t=20 it will be unsafe, but that's later.\n\nI need to see the position at each turn.\n\nAlso, when I move, the row I arrive at needs to be safe at that turn.\n\nFor example, if at t=17 I go U, then at t=18 I am on y=3.\n\nNow, at t=18, delta=1, since t-17=1.\n\nAt delta=1, which rows are unsafe?\n\nFrom above:\n\nRow 6 unsafe at delta=1 and 2.\n\nOthers: row 2 safe at delta=1? Row 2 unsafe only at delta=3.\n\nAt delta=1, t=18:\n\nRow 1: safe\n\nRow 2: safe, since unsafe only delta=3\n\nRow 3: safe, unsafe only delta=3\n\nRow 4: safe\n\nRow 5: safe\n\nRow 6: unsafe at delta=1\n\nRow 7: safe, unsafe only later\n\nRow 8: safe\n\nSo at t=18, row 6 is unsafe, but I'm not on row 6 yet.\n\nIf I go U from y=2 at t=17, to y=3 at t=18.\n\nAt t=18, y=3, delta=1, row 3 is safe at delta=1, since unsafe only at delta=3.\n\nSo I can be on y=3 at t=18.\n\nNow, at t=18, I choose action for t=19.\n\nI can go U to y=4, or D to y=2, or S on y=3.\n\ny=4 is safe, always.\n\nIf I go U to y=4 at t=19.\n\nt=19 is delta=2.\n\nAt delta=2:\n\nRow 6 unsafe (delta=2)\n\nOthers safe except row6.\n\nRow 2 and 3 safe at delta=2, since unsafe only delta=3.\n\nSo at t=19, if I am on y=4, safe.\n\nThen I can go to y=5, etc.\n\nBut let's see how high I can go.\n\nFrom y=4, I can go to y=5, both always safe.\n\ny=5 to y=6, but y=6 is unsafe at delta=1 and 2, which are t=18 and 19.\n\nBut at t=19, delta=2, row6 unsafe.\n\nt=20, delta=3, row6 safe? Earlier: row6 unsafe at delta=1 and 2, safe at delta=0,3,4,...\n\nAt delta=3, row6: as above, at delta=3, span [-17+18=1, -6+18=12], [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, row2 and row3 unsafe at delta=3.\n\nBut let's continue.\n\nI start at t=17, y=2.\n\nOption 1: go up directly.\n\nt=17: a=U, to y=3 at t=18.\n\nt=18: on y=3, safe (delta=1)\n\nNow, at t=18, I can go U to y=4 at t=19.\n\nt=19: on y=4, safe (delta=2)\n\nNow at t=19, go U to y=5 at t=20.\n\nt=20: on y=5, safe (always)\n\nNow at t=20, go U to y=6 at t=21.\n\nt=21: delta=4, since t=21-17=4.\n\nRow6 at delta=4: span [-17+24=7, -6+24=18], [7,18], safe.\n\nSo y=6 at t=21 safe.\n\nThen at t=21, go U to y=7 at t=22.\n\nt=22: delta=5.\n\nRow7: unsafe at delta=9,10,11, so at delta=5, should be safe? Let's see.\n\nRow7 car1: at delta=5, [-47+20= -27, -36+20= -16], both negative, safe.\n\nCar2: [17+20=37,28+20=48], safe.\n\nSo row7 safe at delta=5.\n\nSimilarly, go U to y=8 at t=23.\n\nt=23: delta=6.\n\nRow8: at delta=6, span [-38+18= -20, -27+18= -9], both negative, safe.\n\nUnsafe at delta=9-12, so delta=6 safe.\n\nThen at t=23, on y=8, go U to y=9 at t=24.\n\nt=24: y=9, which is not a freeway, safe, goal reached.\n\nNow, sequence: from t=17 to t=23 actions, arrive at y=9 at t=24.\n\nt=17: start at y=2\n\nt=17: action, say U, to y=3 at t=18\n\nt=18: on y=3, action U, to y=4 at t=19\n\nt=19: on y=4, action U, to y=5 at t=20\n\nt=20: on y=5, action U, to y=6 at t=21\n\nt=21: on y=6, action U, to y=7 at t=22\n\nt=22: on y=7, action U, to y=8 at t=23\n\nt=23: on y=8, action U, to y=9 at t=24\n\nAt t=24, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of turns: from t=17 to t=24, but actions from t=17 to t=23, 7 actions, H=7 turns? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions: a_t for t=17 to t=23, that's 7 actions, and after last action at t=23, we are at y=9 at t=24.\n\nThe turn when we reach: we start at turn t_1=17 with position (0,y_t1), so at turn t, before action, we are at y_t.\n\nThen we choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAnd we reach (0,9) when y_t =9 for some t.\n\nIn this case, at t=24, y=9.\n\nThe minimal H is the number of turns from start to reach, so from t=17 to t=24, that's 8 turns? But actions from t=17 to t=23.\n\nDefine: we need to find H such that at turn t_1 + H - 1, y=9? Let's see the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1 such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1 for the actions, so actions at times t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nThen after all actions, at time t_1 + H -1, we have y =9.\n\nFor example, at time t_1 + 0, we are at initial position, we apply first action.\n\nAfter applying a_{t_1}, we go to y_{t_1 +1} at time t_1 +1.\n\nGenerally: at time t, we are at y_t, we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y.\n\nThen at time t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T.\n\nT = t_1 + H -1.\n\nSince we start at t_1, after H-1 actions, we are at time t_1 + (H-1).\n\ny_{t_1 + (H-1)} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1 of the offset, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-2}? Let's index properly.\n\nSet t_index for the turn.\n\nAt turn t, we have position y_t, then we choose action a_t.\n\nAfter a_t, we move to y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nWe want that at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nT = t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then T= t_1 +1 -1 = t_1, so at turn t_1, y=9, but we start at y=2, not 9, so H at least 7? Minimal steps.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9, need 7 up moves, so minimal H: after 7 up moves, y increases by 7, from 2 to 9.\n\nSo at turn t_1 +7, y=9, if we go up each turn.\n\nThen T = t_1 + H -1 =9, so t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +7, thus H-1=7, H=8.\n\nT = t_1 + H -1 =9.\n\nIf we reach at turn t_1 +7, then y_{t_1+7}=9, so T= t_1+7, thus t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +7, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-2}, for H=8, actions at t_1 to t_1+6, and y_{t_1+7}=9.\n\nIn my earlier plan, I had:\n\nt=17: a=U, to y=3 at t=18\n\nt=18: a=U, to y=4 at t=19\n\nt=19: a=U, to y=5 at t=20\n\nt=20: a=U, to y=6 at t=21\n\nt=21: a=U, to y=7 at t=22\n\nt=22: a=U, to y=8 at t=23\n\nt=23: a=U, to y=9 at t=24\n\nSo at t=24, y=9, which is t= t_1 +7, since t_1=17, 17+7=24.\n\nT=24 = t_1 +7.\n\nWe want y_T=9 with T= t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +7, thus H-1=7, H=8.\n\nAnd actions: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-2} = a_{17} to a_{17+6} = a_{17} to a_{23}, as above.\n\nIn the sequence, for t from 0 to H-1: a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to 7? H=8, t from 0 to 7.\n\nt=0: a_{t_1 +0} = a_{17}\n\nt=1: a_{18}\n\n...\n\nt=6: a_{23}\n\nt=7: no, t from 0 to H-1=7, but H-1=7, so t=0 to 6? H=8, H-1=7, so t from 0 to 6, that's 7 actions: t=0 to 6, actions at t_1 to t_1+6.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to Turn t_1 + H-2: a_{t_1 + H-2}, and after that, at turn t_1 + H-1, y=9.\n\nIn this case, with 7 up moves, we reach in H=8 turns.\n\nBut in the sequence above, I have actions from t=17 to t=23, which is 7 actions, and y=9 at t=24.\n\nIn this path, I used rows: at t=17: y=2, t=18: y=3, t=19: y=4, t=20: y=5, t=21: y=6, t=22: y=7, t=23: y=8, t=24: y=9.\n\nNow, check safety:\n\nt=17, y=2, delta=0, safe.\n\nt=18, y=3, delta=1, row3 safe, as unsafe only at delta=3.\n\nt=19, y=4, delta=2, row4 always safe.\n\nt=20, y=5, delta=3, row5 always safe.\n\nt=21, y=6, delta=4, row6 at delta=4: as above, safe, span [7,18]\n\nt=22, y=7, delta=5, row7: car1 [-47+20= -27, -36+20= -16] <0, car2 [37,48]>0, both not cover 0, safe.\n\nt=23, y=8, delta=6, row8: [-38+18= -20, -27+18= -9] <0, safe.\n\nThen t=24, y=9, safe.\n\nBut at t=20, delta=3, y=5, safe, but row2 and row3 are unsafe at delta=3, but I'm not on them.\n\nIn this path, I didn't encounter any unsafe row at the time I was there.\n\nBut is there a problem? At t=19, y=4, which is row4, but row4 is always safe, and I go to y=5 at t=20.\n\nBut row6 is unsafe at delta=1 and 2, but I'm not on row6 at those times.\n\nIn this path, I passed row6 at t=21, delta=4, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, row7 at t=22, delta=5, safe, etc.\n\nBut can I do it faster? Minimal H=8, since 7 steps up.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach earlier by not going directly, but I don't think so, since I have to go up 7 times.\n\nUnless I start from lower, but I start at y=2, need to go to y=9, so at least 7 up moves.\n\nIf I go down, it takes more turns, so minimal is 7 up moves, H=8.\n\nBut in this case, it seems possible with H=8.\n\nBut let me confirm the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at t=18, delta=1, y=3: row3 at delta=1, cars: car1 [1+12*1=13,12+12=24]? Earlier for row3, same as row2.\n\nAt delta=1, t=18: row3 car1: [1+12=13,12+12=24], [13,24], safe\n\nCar2: [-47+12= -35, -36+12= -24], both negative, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at delta=3, t=20, row3 unsafe, but I'm at y=5 at t=20.\n\ny=5 at t=20, delta=3, safe.\n\nNow, but row7 and row8 have unsafe times later, but I pass them early.\n\nIn this path, all good.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have a_{17}=U, a_{18}=U, a_{19}=U, a_{20}=U, a_{21}=U, a_{22}=U, a_{23}=U.\n\nBut let me see if at any point I need to avoid.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, the row I leave might have issue, but collision is only when I am on the row at that turn.\n\nFor example, at t=20, if I were on row3, unsafe, but I'm not.\n\nIn this case, it seems fine.\n\nBut let me see row6: unsafe at t=18 and t=19, which are delta=1 and 2.\n\nIn my path, I am on row6 at t=21, which is later, safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? H=8 is minimal, I think.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster to higher rows, but no.\n\nAnother thing: at t=17, I could go down to y=1, but that would take more turns, not better.\n\nOr stay, but staying doesn't help.\n\nSo this should be minimal.\n\nBut in the car states, for row2 and row3, they are identical, but I passed row3 at t=18, safe.\n\nBut let me check if at t=19, if I were to be on row3, but I'm not.\n\nIn my sequence, from t=19 I go to y=4, which is row4.\n\nBut row4 is always safe.\n\nPerhaps I can skip some rows, but I have to go through.\n\nAnother point: from y=5 to y=6, at t=20 to t=21.\n\nAt t=20, I am on y=5, go U to y=6 at t=21.\n\nt=21, y=6, delta=4, safe.\n\nCould I go to y=6 earlier? But earlier, row6 unsafe at t=18 and 19.\n\nFor example, if at t=17 I go U to y=3 at t=18.\n\nThen at t=18, instead of going to y=4, I could go to y=5 directly? But from y=3, I can only go to y=2,3,4. Actions U,D,S, so y changes by +1, -1, 0.\n\nSo I can only move to adjacent rows.\n\nCannot skip.\n\nSo from y=3, I can go to y=4 or y=2 or stay.\n\nIn my sequence, I go to y=4 at t=19.\n\nIf I go directly, it should be fine.\n\nBut let me see row7 and row8 unsafe at later times, but since I pass early, no problem.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if I have to wait somewhere.\n\nFor example, suppose I arrive at a row when it is unsafe, I have to wait or detour.\n\nBut in this case, for row6, I arrive at t=21, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut let me confirm the delta for t=21: t=21, t_1=17, delta=4.\n\nRow6: [-17 +6*4= -17+24=7, -6+24=18], [7,18], 0 not in.\n\nGood.\n\nt=22: y=7, delta=5, row7: car1 [-47+4*5= -47+20= -27, -36+20= -16], [-27,-16], 0 not in.\n\nCar2 [17+20=37,28+20=48], safe.\n\nt=23: y=8, delta=6, row8: [-38+3*6= -38+18= -20, -27+18= -9], [-20,-9], 0 not in.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, but the problem is to reach (0,9), which I do at t=24.\n\nBut is there a way with H=7? That would mean reaching at t=23, but from y=2 to y=9 in 6 steps? 6 up moves would be to y=8, not 9.\n\ny=2 +6 =8, so at t=23, y=8, not 9.\n\nThen need one more to y=9.\n\nSo minimal H=8.\n\nPerhaps with down moves, but that would take more.\n\nSo H=8 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, actions: a_{17}=U, a_{18}=U, a_{19}=U, a_{20}=U, a_{21}=U, a_{22}=U, a_{23}=U.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be listed.\n\nBut let me write the turns.\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nAfter that, at turn 24, y=9.\n\nBut the sequence has 7 actions, from turn 17 to 23.\n\nIn the box, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\n}\n\nBut is this correct? I think I missed something.\n\nIn the beginning, at t=17, I am on y=2, and I go U to y=3.\n\nBut row3 at t=18, delta=1, is safe, yes.\n\nBut let me double-check row2 and row3 unsafe at t=20, delta=3.\n\nt=20 is when I am on y=5, not on 2 or 3.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 4 and 5 are both always safe, but I passed them quickly.\n\nPerhaps I can go slower, but no need.\n\nBut in the car state, for row7 and row8, they have unsafe times, but since I pass before, it's fine.\n\nBut let me see if there is any constraint that forces me to wait.\n\nFor example, if I were to go through row6 at t=19, it would be unsafe, but I didn't.\n\nIn my path, I go through row6 at t=21, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut the player position is (0,y), and cars are on the rows, but since I move vertically, and cars move horizontally, and I only care about x=0.\n\nIn this case, since I only care about x=0, and the spans, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I should output the sequence.\n\nBut the answer should include H, but in the box, it only says the sequence, I think.\n\nThe problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the answer format, it only shows the sequence, with actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-2.\n\nIn the box, it lists the actions.\n\nAnd H is not explicitly in the box, but since the sequence has H actions? No.\n\nIn my case, 7 actions for H=8.\n\nPerhaps I need to state H.\n\nBut the answer format shows only the actions in the box.\n\n\"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} ... }\"\n\nWith the actions.\n\nAnd H is minimal, so with the sequence, H is implied.\n\nNow, but in this sequence, it works.\n\nBut let me confirm with another possibility.\n\nSuppose at some point I need to avoid.\n\nFor example, at t=20, if I were on row3, it would be unsafe, but I'm not.\n\nPerhaps I can go to row4 earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=17, go U to y=3 at t=18.\n\nThen at t=18, go U to y=4 at t=19.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt t=17, I could stay on y=2, but then at t=18, y=2, which is safe since delta=1, row2 safe except at delta=3.\n\nAt t=18, delta=1, row2: car1 [1+12=13,12+12=24], safe; car2 [-47+12= -35, -36+12= -24], safe.\n\nSo I could stay, but that would delay, not better.\n\nSimilarly, going down to y=1, then need to come back, more turns.\n\nSo direct up is best.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U from turn 17 to 23.\n\nBut in the sequence, turn 23: U to y=9 at t=24.\n\nNow, but let me write the actions.\n\nSo for H=8, actions at turn 17 to 23.\n\nIn the box:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\n}\n\nBut is there a car on row 3 or something that I missed?\n\nAnother thing: freeway 3 has the same cars as freeway 2, so row 3 unsafe at t=20, but I pass row 3 at t=18, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if moving to a row that will be unsafe immediately after, but collision only at the turn you are on, not future.\n\nThe note says: if you move to a different row at turn T, you are not on that row until turn T+1, so at turn T, you are on the old row.\n\nFor example, at turn T, on row y, then you choose action, if you move to y+1, at turn T+1, you are on y+1.\n\nAnd at turn T, you are on row y, so you collide only if row y has car covering 0 at turn T.\n\nAt turn T+1, on row y+1, collide if row y+1 has car covering 0 at turn T+1.\n\nSo in my sequence, all safe.\n\nPerhaps for row 8, at later times unsafe, but I pass at t=23, which is early.\n\nt=23, delta=6, safe.\n\nNow, but in the car states, for example, row 7 has a car at (28,17,right,4), which at t=17, head 28, tail 17, so moving right, at later times it might cover 0, but at delta=9 to 11, t=26 to 28, which is after I passed.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut the minimal H is 8, with 7 up actions.\n\nSo the answer should be as above.\n\nBut let me see the initial position: (0,2), and I need to reach (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, all U.\n\nBut in the output, it should be for turns starting from 17.\n\nNow, the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\", so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at t_1 + t.\n\nH=8, t from 0 to 7, actions at t_1+0=17 to t_1+7=24? t=0 to 7, that's 8 actions, but we only need 7 actions to reach.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, H=8, t=0 to 7, actions at 17 to 24.\n\nBut at turn 24, if I apply action, I would go to y=10 or something, but I don't need to, since I reach at turn 24 y=9.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nThe sequence of actions is only until I reach.\n\nIn the action sequence, for t from 0 to H-1, but after H-1 actions, at time t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nIn this case, with 7 actions (H-1=7), at time t_1 +7 =24, y=9.\n\nSo actions: for t=0 to 6, actions at 17 to 23.\n\nIn the list, it should be Turn 17: U, ..., Turn 23: U.\n\nIn the box, it lists from Turn t_1 to the last action turn.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I should write it.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 17\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 8. This means that after executing the sequence of actions from turn 17 to turn 23, the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 24 (since \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 17 + 8 - 1 = 24\\)).\n\nThe sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) at every turn from turn 17 to turn 23. This path avoids all collisions with cars on the freeways (y = 1 to 8) because:\n- At turn 17 (delta = 0), on y = 2: safe (0 not in any car span).\n- At turn 18 (delta = 1), on y = 3: safe (row 3 unsafe only at delta = 3).\n- At turn 19 (delta = 2), on y = 4: always safe.\n- At turn 20 (delta = 3), on y = 5: always safe.\n- At turn 21 (delta = 4), on y = 6: safe (span [7, 18], 0 not in).\n- At turn 22 (delta = 5), on y = 7: safe (car1: [-27, -16], car2: [37, 48], 0 not in).\n- At turn 23 (delta = 6), on y = 8: safe (span [-20, -9], 0 not in).\n- At turn 24, on y = 9: safe (no cars).\n\nThis path is optimal, as moving up 7 times is the minimum required to increase y from 2 to 9, and no shorter sequence is possible.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: U \\\\\nTurn 22: U \\\\\nTurn 23: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 3) on turn t_1 = 18. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimum number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn. Importantly, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So, if you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you're still on y_T during turn T, and you only occupy y_{T+1} starting from turn T+1.\n\nThe car spans are given for turn t_1=18, and we need to compute their positions at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list all the cars on each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: (head h=-48, tail τ=-95, direction right, speed s=48)\n\nSince it's right-moving, at turn T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-95 + 48(T-18), -48 + 48(T-18)]\n\n- Freeway 2: two cars: \n  - First: (24, 13, right, 12) → right-moving, so [13 + 12(T-18), 24 + 12(T-18)]\n  - Second: (-24, -35, right, 12) → [-35 + 12(T-18), -24 + 12(T-18)]\n\n- Freeway 3: same as freeway 2? It says: (24, 13, right, 12), (-24, -35, right, 12) so identical to freeway 2.\n\n- Freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36) → left-moving, so span is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)] but head and tail might be confusing.\n\nFor left-moving cars, the span moves left, so if head is at h, tail at τ, and it's moving left, then at time T, head is at h - s(T-t_1), tail at τ - s(T-t_1). But in the notation, for left-moving, head and tail might not be in order; I think we need to interpret head as the front.\n\nThe problem says: for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor direction, left or right.\n\nFor right-moving, head is greater than tail, I assume, since it's moving right, head is to the right.\n\nIn freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36). 48 and 83, 48 < 83, but if left-moving, and head is 83, tail is 48? But usually, head is the front.\n\nPerhaps I need to be careful with the head and tail definition.\n\nLet's read the update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the input, for each car, it's (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor example, freeway 4: head=48, tail=83, direction=left, speed=36.\n\nBut if direction is left, and head=48, tail=83, that might be inconsistent because if moving left, head should be the leftmost or rightmost?\n\nThe span is given as [h, τ] for left-moving at t_1.\n\nAt t_1, for freeway 4, [h, τ] = [48, 83], so if left-moving, the car is from 48 to 83, and moving left, so at T, it's [48 - sΔT, 83 - sΔT].\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, it's [τ, h] at t_1, so for example freeway 2 first car: head=24, tail=13, direction=right, so [τ, h] = [13, 24] at t_1.\n\nThen at T, [13 + 12(T-18), 24 + 12(T-18)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlso, collision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at that exact turn.\n\nThe player position y_t is for turn t, so at turn T, player is on y_T.\n\nAnd when moving, at turn T, action a_T determines y_{T+1}, so during turn T, player is on y_T.\n\nNow, I need to get to y=9 from y=3 in min turns.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars. But the player needs to be at (0,9), which is above the freeways.\n\ny=9 is the top row, no cars, so once there, it's safe.\n\nBut to reach it, we need to pass through the freeways.\n\nSince we start at y=3, and need to go to y=9, we need to move up, but we have to avoid the cars on y=4 to y=8 when we are on those rows.\n\ny=3 is also a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=3 is freeway 3, which has cars.\n\nAt turn t_1=18, player is on y=3, which is freeway 3.\n\nNow, freeway 3 has cars: (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAt turn 18, for freeway 3:\n\nFirst car: [τ, h] = [13,24] so span [13,24] at t=18\n\nSecond car: [τ, h] = [-35,-24] since τ=-35, h=-24 for the second car.\n\nAt T, for first car: [13 + 12(T-18), 24 + 12(T-18)]\n\nFor second car: [-35 + 12(T-18), -24 + 12(T-18)]\n\nCollision at y=3 at turn T if 0 is in the span of either car at that turn.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nPlayer starts at y=3 at turn 18.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince we need min turns, probably we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid the cars.\n\nFirst, let's see when it's safe to be on each freeway.\n\nBut it depends on the turn, because cars move.\n\nSo I need to compute for each freeway and each turn, whether position 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nSince the player must be at x=0, we only care about whether 0 is in the car span at that turn for the freeway we are on.\n\nFor each freeway k, and for each turn T, we can compute if there is a collision if player is on k at turn T, which happens if for some car on k, 0 is in its span at T.\n\nThen, the player path is a sequence of y-positions, starting from y=3 at t=18, and each step change by -1,0,+1, ending at y=9 for some turn.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, once we reach it, we stop.\n\nNow, y=9 is reached when, for example, if at turn T we are at y=8, and we go up, then at turn T+1 we are at y=9.\n\nThe turn when we first reach y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, H is the number of turns from t_1, so at t_1 + H - 1 we reach y=9.\n\nLet t be the turn index, with t=18 being current.\n\nSet Δt = t - 18, so at Δt=0, t=18, y=3.\n\nWe need to find actions for t from 18 to some T, such that at turn T, y_T =9, and min H where H = number of actions, so from t=18 to t=18+H-1, we have H actions, and y_{18+H-1} =9.\n\nFor example, if we do nothing, y stays, but we need to go to 9, so we must move up.\n\nThe minimal H: since from 3 to 9, we need at least 6 up moves, but we can have stays or down, but down would make it longer, so probably minimal H is at least 6, if we go up every turn.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions, so it might take more turns if we need to wait.\n\nFirst, let's compute the collision points for each freeway over time.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, the spans are linear, so we can find when 0 is covered.\n\nFor each freeway, list the cars and their span over time.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nOne car: head h=-48, tail τ=-95, direction right, speed s=48\n\nRight-moving, so at time t (turn), span is [τ + s(t-18), h + s(t-18)] = [-95 + 48(t-18), -48 + 48(t-18)]\n\n0 is in span if -95 + 48(Δt) ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 48(Δt) where Δt = t - 18\n\nSo -95 + 48Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 48Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -95 + 48Δt ≤ 0 => 48Δt ≤ 95 => Δt ≤ 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so Δt ≤ 1 since integer? Δt is integer, turns are discrete.\n\nt is integer turn, so Δt integer.\n\n-95 + 48Δt ≤ 0 => 48Δt ≤ 95 => Δt ≤ 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so since Δt integer, Δt <= 1\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -48 + 48Δt => 48Δt >= 48 => Δt >= 1\n\nSo both: Δt >=1 and Δt <=1, so only at Δt=1, which is t=19.\n\nAt t=19, Δt=1, span: -95 + 48(1) = -95 + 48 = -47, and -48 + 48(1) = 0, so [ -47, 0 ], and 0 is included, since 0 <= 0.\n\nAt Δt=1, lower bound -47, upper bound 0, so 0 is in [ -47, 0 ].\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nFor example, at Δt=0, span [-95,-48], 0 not in.\n\nAt Δt=2, [-95+96, -48+96] = [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision only at t=19 when on y=1.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2\n\nTwo cars.\n\nFirst car: head=24, tail=13, right, speed=12\n\nAt t_1, [τ,h] = [13,24]\n\nAt t, [13 + 12(Δt), 24 + 12(Δt)] where Δt = t-18\n\n0 in span if 13 + 12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 24 + 12Δt\n\nFirst, 13 + 12Δt ≤ 0 => 12Δt <= -13, impossible since Δt >=0, so never true. Thus 0 never in first car's span on freeway 2.\n\nSecond car: head=-24, tail=-35, right, speed=12\n\nAt t_1, [τ,h] = [-35,-24]\n\nAt t, [ -35 + 12Δt, -24 + 12Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 12Δt\n\nFirst: -35 + 12Δt ≤ 0 => 12Δt <= 35 => Δt <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so Δt <= 2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 + 12Δt => 12Δt >= 24 => Δt >= 2\n\nSo Δt >=2 and Δt <=2, so at Δt=2, t=20\n\nAt Δt=2, span: -35 + 24 = -11, -24 + 24 = 0, so [ -11, 0 ], 0 included.\n\nSo collision on freeway 2 only at t=20.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3, same as freeway 2? Cars: (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFirst car: same as above, 0 never in span.\n\nSecond car: same, 0 in span only at Δt=2, t=20.\n\nSo on freeway 3, collision only at t=20.\n\nBut player is on y=3 at t=18, which is Δt=0.\n\nAt t=18, Δt=0, for second car span [-35,-24], 0 not in, so no collision at t=18 on y=3.\n\nAt t=20, if on y=3, collision.\n\nNow freeway 4: y=4\n\nCars: only one? (48,83,left,36)\n\nDirection left, so at t_1, span [h, τ] = [48,83]? Head=48, tail=83, so [48,83]\n\nMoving left, at t, [48 - 36(Δt), 83 - 36(Δt)]\n\n0 in span if 48 - 36Δt <= 0 <= 83 - 36Δt\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36Δt <= 0 => -36Δt <= -48 => 36Δt >= 48 => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so Δt >= 2 since integer\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 83 - 36Δt => 36Δt <= 83 => Δt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so Δt <= 2\n\nΔt >= 2 and Δt <= 2, so Δt=2, t=20\n\nAt Δt=2, [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11], and 0 is between -24 and 11, yes, so 0 in span.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nFor example, Δt=1: [48-36,83-36]=[12,47], 0 not in\n\nΔt=3: [48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25], 0 not in\n\nSo freeway 4 collision only at t=20.\n\nFreeway 5: y=5, same as freeway 4? Cars: (48,83,left,36) same as above.\n\nSo collision only at t=20.\n\nNow freeway 6: y=6\n\nCars: (0,-11,right,6)\n\nHead=0, tail=-11, direction right, speed=6\n\nRight-moving, so at t_1, [τ,h] = [-11,0]\n\nAt t, [ -11 + 6(Δt), 0 + 6(Δt) ] = [ -11 + 6Δt, 6Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 6Δt <= 0 <= 6Δt\n\nFirst: -11 + 6Δt <= 0 => 6Δt <= 11 => Δt <= 11/6 ≈ 1.833, so Δt <= 1\n\nSecond: 0 <= 6Δt always true for Δt >=0\n\nSo for Δt <=1, and Δt integer, Δt=0 or 1\n\nAt Δt=0, t=18, span [-11,0], 0 is included? Upper bound 0, so 0 <= 0, yes, included.\n\nAt Δt=1, t=19, span [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6], 0 is in.\n\nAt Δt=2, [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo on freeway 6, collision when at t=18 or t=19.\n\nt=18: Δt=0, span [-11,0], includes 0\n\nt=19: Δt=1, span [-5,6], includes 0\n\nt=20: Δt=2, [1,12], not include 0\n\nNow freeway 7: y=7\n\nCars: (-32,-43,right,4) and (32,21,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head=-32? tail=-43, direction right.\n\nAt t_1, [τ,h] = [-43,-32]\n\nAt t, [ -43 + 4Δt, -32 + 4Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -43 + 4Δt <= 0 <= -32 + 4Δt\n\nFirst: -43 + 4Δt <= 0 => 4Δt <= 43 => Δt <= 43/4 = 10.75, so Δt <=10\n\nSecond: 0 <= -32 + 4Δt => 4Δt >= 32 => Δt >= 8\n\nSo for Δt from 8 to 10 inclusive.\n\nAt Δt=8: -43+32= -11, -32+32=0, so [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔt=9: -43+36= -7, -32+36=4, [-7,4], 0 in\n\nΔt=10: -43+40= -3, -32+40=8, [-3,8], 0 in\n\nΔt=11: -43+44=1, -32+44=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (32,21,right,4)\n\nHead=32, tail=21, right, so [τ,h] = [21,32]\n\nAt t, [21 + 4Δt, 32 + 4Δt]\n\n0 in span if 21 + 4Δt <= 0 <= 32 + 4Δt\n\nFirst: 21 + 4Δt <=0? 21>0, 4Δt>=0, impossible. So never true. 0 never in this car's span.\n\nSo only the first car matters for freeway 7, collision at t such that Δt=8,9,10, i.e., t=18+8=26, t=27, t=28.\n\nNow freeway 8: y=8\n\nCars: (-24,-35,right,3)\n\nHead=-24, tail=-35, direction right, speed=3\n\nAt t_1, [τ,h] = [-35,-24]\n\nAt t, [ -35 + 3Δt, -24 + 3Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 3Δt <= 0 <= -24 + 3Δt\n\nFirst: -35 + 3Δt <= 0 => 3Δt <= 35 => Δt <= 35/3 ≈ 11.666, Δt <=11\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 + 3Δt => 3Δt >= 24 => Δt >= 8\n\nSo Δt from 8 to 11 inclusive.\n\nAt Δt=8: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔt=9: -35+27= -8, -24+27=3, [-8,3], 0 in\n\nΔt=10: -35+30= -5, -24+30=6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔt=11: -35+33= -2, -24+33=9, [-2,9], 0 in\n\nΔt=12: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], not\n\nSo collision on freeway 8 at t=26,27,28,29 (since Δt=8,9,10,11, t=26,27,28,29)\n\nt=18 + Δt, Δt=8: t=26, up to Δt=11: t=29.\n\nNow, summarize the collision times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: collision only at t=19\n\n- y=2: collision only at t=20\n\n- y=3: collision only at t=20 (since at t=18 no collision, as we saw)\n\n- y=4: collision only at t=20\n\n- y=5: collision only at t=20\n\n- y=6: collision at t=18 and t=19\n\n- y=7: collision at t=26,27,28\n\n- y=8: collision at t=26,27,28,29\n\nPlayer starts at t=18, y=3.\n\nAt t=18, on y=3: no collision, as we have.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nTo go from y=3 to y=9, we need to increase y by 6.\n\nEach up move increases y by 1, so minimum 6 turns if we go up every turn.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on a freeway when it has collision.\n\nAlso, we can stay or go down to wait, but that increases turns.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can go directly up from t=18.\n\nStart t=18, y=3, safe.\n\nAction at t=18: if we go up, U, then y_{19} =4\n\nBut at t=19, if we are on y=4? At turn t=19, player position y_{19} =4, which is freeway 4.\n\nNow, is freeway 4 safe at t=19?\n\nFrom above, freeway 4 has collision only at t=20, so at t=19, no collision. Earlier we computed for y=4, collision only at t=20, so at t=19, safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up again to y=5 at t=20.\n\ny_{19} =4 (after action at t=18)\n\nNow action at t=19: if U, then y_{20} =5\n\nAt turn t=20, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 collision at t=20? Yes, from above, y=5 collision at t=20.\n\nSo if at t=20 we are on y=5, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf we go up at t=19 to y=5, then at t=20, we are on y=5, which has collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=5 at t=20.\n\nWe could stay or go down at some point.\n\nSince we need to go to y=9, and y=5,6,7,8 might have issues.\n\nList the dangerous times:\n\nFor y=4: safe except t=20\n\ny=5: safe except t=20\n\ny=6: unsafe at t=18,19; safe after? At t=20, y=6 is safe, since collision only at 18 and 19.\n\ny=6 collision at t=18 and 19, so at t=20 and later, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7: unsafe at t=26,27,28; safe otherwise? From t=18 to 25, and t=29 onwards, but since we are going up, we might not reach late times if we go fast.\n\nSimilarly y=8: unsafe at t=26,27,28,29; safe before and after.\n\nNow, player starts at t=18, y=3.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nOne way: go up as much as possible, but avoid the collision points.\n\nFor example, at t=18, y=3, safe.\n\nAction U: to y=4 at t=19.\n\nt=19, y=4, safe (since y=4 unsafe only at t=20)\n\nNow at t=19, if we go U again, to y=5 at t=20, but at t=20, y=5 is unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot go to y=5 at t=20.\n\nWe could go S or D at t=19.\n\nIf S at t=19, then y_{20} = y_{19} =4 (since action at t=19 determines y_{20})\n\nAt turn t=19, we are on y=4, action S means y_{20} =4.\n\nThen at t=20, we are on y=4.\n\nBut y=4 is unsafe at t=20! Collision.\n\ny=4 collision at t=20, so if on y=4 at t=20, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go D at t=19, y_{20} = y_{19} -1 =4-1=3.\n\nThen at t=20, on y=3.\n\nBut y=3 collision at t=20, also unsafe.\n\nSo at t=19, if we are on y=4, and we do any action:\n\n- U: to y=5 at t=20, unsafe at t=20\n\n- S: to y=4 at t=20, unsafe\n\n- D: to y=3 at t=20, unsafe\n\nAll lead to unsafe at t=20.\n\nBut we need to be at some y at t=20 that is safe.\n\nWhat y is safe at t=20?\n\ny=1: unsafe at t=19, but at t=20? y=1 collision only at t=19, so at t=20, y=1 is safe? Let's check.\n\ny=1: collision only at t=19, so at t=20, no collision.\n\ny=2: collision only at t=20, so unsafe at t=20.\n\ny=3: unsafe at t=20\n\ny=4: unsafe at t=20\n\ny=5: unsafe at t=20\n\ny=6: unsafe at t=18,19; at t=20, safe\n\ny=7: unsafe at t=26-28, so at t=20 safe\n\ny=8: similarly safe at t=20\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nSo at t=20, safe rows are y=0,1,6,7,8,9\n\nBut we are at t=19 on y=4, which is safe at t=19, but we need to choose action for y_{20}.\n\nIf we go U to y=5, y_{20}=5, unsafe\n\nS to y=4, unsafe\n\nD to y=3, unsafe\n\nBut y=6 is safe at t=20, but we are at y=4, we can only go to y=3,4,5.\n\nNone are safe at t=20.\n\nProblem.\n\nWe cannot be at y=4 at t=19, because whatever we do, at t=20 we end up on a row that is unsafe.\n\ny=5 at t=20 unsafe, y=4 unsafe, y=3 unsafe.\n\nBut we could have not gone to y=4 at t=19.\n\nAt t=18, we started at y=3, safe.\n\nInstead of going up to y=4 at t=19, we could stay or go down.\n\nIf at t=18, action S: then y_{19} = y_{18} =3 (since S, no change)\n\nAt t=19, we are on y=3.\n\nNow, y=3 at t=19: is it safe?\n\ny=3 collision only at t=20, so at t=19, y=3 is safe? Yes, from earlier, only unsafe at t=20.\n\nThen at t=19, we can choose action.\n\nIf we go U, to y=4 at t=20, but y=4 unsafe at t=20.\n\nS to y=3 at t=20, unsafe\n\nD to y=2 at t=20.\n\ny=2: collision at t=20, so unsafe.\n\nAll unsafe again.\n\nIf we go down at t=18.\n\nAction D: y_{19} = y_{18} -1 =3-1=2\n\nAt t=19, on y=2.\n\ny=2: collision only at t=20, so at t=19 safe.\n\nThen at t=19, we need to choose action for y_{20}.\n\nIf U, to y=3 at t=20, unsafe\n\nS to y=2 at t=20, unsafe (y=2 unsafe at t=20)\n\nD to y=1 at t=20.\n\ny=1 at t=20: safe, since collision only at t=19.\n\nSo if at t=19 on y=2, we can go D to y=1 at t=20.\n\nThen at t=20, on y=1, safe.\n\nBut we are going down, away from the goal.\n\nThen from there, we need to go up to y=9, which takes more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=20, y=1, safe.\n\nThen we can start going up.\n\nBut y=1 is safe except t=19, which is past.\n\ny=2 safe except t=20, which is now past.\n\nAt t=21, y=1, we can go U to y=2 at t=22? Let's see.\n\nAfter t=20, all dangerous times for lower rows are past except for higher rows later.\n\nBut we have to go through the rows.\n\nPerhaps we need to wait until after t=20 to be on y=4 or y=5.\n\ny=4 and y=5 are only unsafe at t=20, so before or after safe.\n\nBut at t=19, y=4 is safe, but we cannot go to y=5 at t=20 directly.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=6 at some point.\n\ny=6 is unsafe at t=18 and 19, but safe at t=20 and later.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 is unsafe only at t=20.\n\nSo one plan: at t=18, on y=3, safe.\n\nInstead of going up, we stay or go down to avoid being on y=3,4,5 at t=20.\n\nBut we need to be on a safe row at t=20.\n\nPossible safe rows at t=20: y=0,1,6,7,8\n\ny=0 and y=1 are low, y=6 is high.\n\nFrom y=3, we can reach y=6 by t=20?\n\nt=18: y=3\n\nIf we go U at t=18: y_19=4\n\nAt t=19, on y=4\n\nIf we go U again at t=19: y_20=5, but y=5 unsafe at t=20.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf at t=19, we go U to y=5 at t=20, unsafe.\n\nBut y=6 is safe at t=20, but from y=4 at t=19, we can only go to y=3,4,5, not directly to y=6.\n\nUnless we can move faster, but no, only +1 per turn.\n\nSo from y=4, it takes two turns to reach y=6: for example, U to y=5 then U to y=6.\n\nBut at t=20, if we are on y=5, unsafe.\n\nWe could be on y=6 at t=20.\n\nHow? From y=3 at t=18, to y=6 at t=20.\n\nThat requires two up moves: t=18 U to y=4 at t=19, then t=19 U to y=5 at t=20, but y=5 at t=20 unsafe.\n\nIf we do U at t=18 and U at t=19, we are at y=5 at t=20, not y=6.\n\nTo be at y=6 at t=20, we need to be at y=5 at t=19, then U to y=6 at t=20.\n\nBut at t=19, if on y=5.\n\nNow, how to be on y=5 at t=19?\n\nAt t=18, we are at y=3.\n\nIf we go U, to y=4 at t=19.\n\nNot y=5.\n\nCan't reach y=5 from y=3 in one turn.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=6 at t=20 from start.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=7 or 8 at t=20, even farther.\n\nSo the only possible safe rows at t=20 are y=0,1,6 but y=6 not reachable from y=3 in two turns with the moves.\n\nFrom t=18 to t=20, two actions.\n\nFrom y=3, after two actions, possible y positions:\n\n- U,U: y=5\n\n- U,S: y=4\n\n- U,D: y=3\n\n- S,U: y=4\n\n- S,S: y=3\n\n- S,D: y=2\n\n- D,U: y=3\n\n- D,S: y=2\n\n- D,D: y=1\n\nSo possible y at t=20: 1,2,3,4,5\n\nAll of which are unsafe at t=20, except if y=1, but y=1 is safe at t=20, as we said.\n\ny=1 at t=20 is safe.\n\nHow to get to y=1 at t=20.\n\nFrom above, if we do D,D: at t=18 D to y=2 at t=19, then at t=19 D to y=1 at t=20.\n\nThen at t=20, on y=1, safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut it will take many turns to reach y=9.\n\nSince we have to avoid the t=20 collision, we need to not be on y=2,3,4,5 at t=20.\n\nSo we must be on y=1 or lower, or y=6 or higher, but y=6 not reachable.\n\nSo only option is to go down to y=1 or y=0.\n\ny=0 is also safe.\n\nBut let's see the minimal turns.\n\nIf we go down to y=1 at t=20, then we need to go from y=1 to y=9, which requires 8 up moves, so at least 8 turns from t=20, so total turns from start: from t=18 to t=20 is 2 turns to get to y=1, then 8 turns to y=9, so at t=28 we reach y=9? Let's calculate.\n\nAt t=20, y=1\n\nThen each up move increases y by 1, need to go to y=9, so 8 up moves.\n\nAfter k up moves, y = 1 + k.\n\nSet 1 + k =9, k=8.\n\nSo actions from t=20 to t=27: U each turn, then at t=28, y=9? Let's index.\n\nTurn t, position y_t.\n\nAt turn t=20, y=1\n\nAction at t=20: U, then y_{21} =2\n\nAt t=21, y=2\n\nAction U, y_{22}=3\n\nAnd so on, up to y_{28}=9.\n\nAfter action at t=27: U, y_{28}=9.\n\nSo reached at t=28.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions on the way up.\n\nFor example, at t=21, on y=2, is it safe? y=2 collision only at t=20, which is before, so at t=21 and later, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at t=22: y=3 unsafe only at t=20, so safe at t=22.\n\ny=4 at t=23: safe, since only unsafe at t=20.\n\ny=5 at t=24: safe.\n\ny=6 at t=25: y=6 unsafe at t=18,19, so at t=25 safe.\n\nBut we also have later collisions for y=7 and y=8 at t=26-29.\n\nIn this path, at t=21 on y=2, t=22 y=3, t=23 y=4, t=24 y=5, t=25 y=6, all fine so far.\n\nThen at t=25, y=6, action U to y=7 at t=26.\n\nAt t=26, on y=7.\n\nBut y=7 unsafe at t=26,27,28.\n\nAt t=26, if on y=7, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=7 at t=26, unsafe.\n\nWe could go slower or faster.\n\nAt t=25, y=6, we could stay or something, but we need to go up.\n\nTo avoid being on y=7 at t=26,27,28.\n\nUnsafe times for y=7: t=26,27,28\n\nSo we can be on y=7 at t=25 or earlier, or t=29 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nIn the current path, we are at t=25 y=6, then if U at t=25, to y=7 at t=26, which is unsafe.\n\nIf we stay at y=6 at t=25, action S, then y_{26}=6, but y=6 is safe, then at t=26 on y=6.\n\nThen we can go U at t=26 to y=7 at t=27.\n\nBut at t=27, on y=7, which is unsafe (t=27 is unsafe for y=7).\n\nSimilarly, if we go U at t=26 to y=7 at t=27, unsafe.\n\nOr if we wait, y_{27}=6 if S, then U at t=27 to y=7 at t=28, but t=28 unsafe for y=7.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=26,27,28.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=7 at t=26,27,28.\n\nWe must be on y=7 at t<=25 or t>=29.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, unsafe at t=26,27,28,29, so must be at t<=25 or t>=30.\n\nBut t=25 is early, we might not reach in time.\n\nFirst, from start, we are at t=18 y=3.\n\nIf we go down to y=1 at t=20, then start going up.\n\nAt t=20 y=1\n\nt=21 y=2 (after U at t=20)\n\nt=22 y=3 (U at t=21)\n\nt=23 y=4 (U at t=22)\n\nt=24 y=5 (U at t=23)\n\nt=25 y=6 (U at t=24)\n\nNow at t=25, y=6\n\nWe need to go to y=7, but cannot be on y=7 at t=26,27,28.\n\nIf we go U at t=25, y_{26}=7, unsafe at t=26.\n\nIf we do S at t=25, y_{26}=6\n\nThen at t=26, on y=6, safe.\n\nThen action at t=26: if U, to y=7 at t=27, unsafe.\n\nS, to y=6 at t=27, then U at t=27 to y=7 at t=28, unsafe.\n\nD, to y=5 at t=27, then we go down, not good.\n\nSo we are stuck at y=6 until t=29.\n\nAt t=26, on y=6, if we do nothing, we can stay at y=6 until t=28, for example.\n\nThen at t=28, action U to y=7 at t=29.\n\nAt t=29, on y=7.\n\nNow y=7 unsafe at t=26,27,28, so at t=29, is it safe? t=29, Δt=11, for y=7, collision at Δt=8,9,10, so t=26,27,28; at t=29, Δt=11, not in collision, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, then at t=29, y=7, action U to y=8 at t=30.\n\nAt t=30, on y=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=26,27,28,29 (Δt=8 to 11)\n\nAt t=30, Δt=12, not in collision, so safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at t=31.\n\nSo sequence: from t=20 y=1\n\nt=20: U, y21=2\n\nt=21: U, y22=3\n\nt=22: U, y23=4\n\nt=23: U, y24=5\n\nt=24: U, y25=6\n\nt=25: S, y26=6 (stay to avoid)\n\nt=26: S, y27=6\n\nt=27: S, y28=6? Let's see when we go up.\n\nAt t=25, y=6, action S: y26=6\n\nt=26, action S: y27=6\n\nt=27, action S: y28=6\n\nt=28, action U: y29=7\n\nt=29, action U: y30=8\n\nt=30, action U: y31=9\n\nReached at t=31.\n\nBut we started from t=18, and we have actions from t=18 to t=30, so H=13 actions? Let's count turns.\n\nt=18: start position, action for next position.\n\nAt turn t, we take action a_t to determine y_{t+1}.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t, we output a_t.\n\nPlayer position at turn t is given before action.\n\nAt turn t, position is y_t, then we choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nIn this case, at t=18, y=3.\n\nWe need to get to y=9 at some turn T.\n\nIn the above, we have to go down first.\n\nBut perhaps there is a faster way.\n\nSince y=6 is safe after t=19, we could go directly to y=6 as soon as possible.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=18, to y=6.\n\nIt takes at least 3 up moves: e.g., U at t=18 to y=4 at t=19, U at t=19 to y=5 at t=20, U at t=20 to y=6 at t=21.\n\nBut at t=20, if we are on y=5, it is unsafe, as we have collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=5 at t=20.\n\nIf we can reach y=6 at t=20, but impossible, as it requires being at y=5 at t=19, which from y=3 at t=18 not possible.\n\nSo earliest to reach y=6 is t=21, as above.\n\nAt t=21, on y=6.\n\nHow? t=18: y=3, action U: y19=4\n\nt=19: action ? If U, y20=5, but at t=20 on y=5 unsafe.\n\nSo at t=19, on y=4, we cannot go U to y=5 at t=20.\n\nSo we must do something else at t=19.\n\nFor example, at t=19, on y=4, we can go D to y=3 at t=20, but y=3 unsafe at t=20.\n\nGo S to y=4 at t=20, unsafe.\n\nOr go U to y=5 at t=20, unsafe.\n\nNo good.\n\nAt t=18, instead of U, we stay or go down.\n\nBut if we stay at t=18, action S, y19=3\n\nThen at t=19, on y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=19, action U to y=4 at t=20, but y=4 unsafe at t=20.\n\nSame issue.\n\nIf at t=19, we go D to y=2 at t=20, then y=2 unsafe at t=20.\n\nOr S to y=3 at t=20, unsafe.\n\nOnly if we go down to y=1 at t=20, as before.\n\nBut that takes us down.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=6 at t=21 without being unsafe.\n\nFrom t=18 y=3, if we go U to y=4 at t=19 (safe)\n\nThen at t=19, instead of going up, we go down or stay, but if we go down to y=3 at t=20, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAnother idea: at t=18, go down to y=2 at t=19.\n\nAt t=19, on y=2, safe (since y=2 unsafe only at t=20)\n\nThen at t=19, we can go U to y=3 at t=20, but y=3 unsafe at t=20.\n\nGo D to y=1 at t=20, safe, as before.\n\nThen we are at y=1 at t=20.\n\nThen we can go up, but we have the later issue with y=7 and y=8.\n\nBut with waiting, we reached at t=31.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach faster by not going down.\n\nSince the only problem is t=20 for y=2,3,4,5, we can be on a different row at t=20.\n\nBut the only safe rows at t=20 are y=0,1,6,7,8.\n\ny=6 not reachable, y=7 and 8 too high.\n\ny=0 or 1 reachable by going down.\n\nBut we can go to y=0 or 1 at t=20, then go up.\n\nBut to reach y=9, from y=1, it takes 8 steps, but we can start from t=20.\n\nBut we also have to deal with the upper freeways later.\n\nTo save time, we can go up to y=6 as soon as possible after t=20.\n\nEarliest to be at y=6 is t=21.\n\nAt t=21, y=6.\n\nHow?\n\nFrom t=18 y=3:\n\nt=18 action: let's say we need to avoid being on dangerous rows at t=20.\n\nSo at t=20, we must be on y=0,1, or 6+ but 6 not possible, so only 0 or 1.\n\nSo go down.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=18 action D: a_{18} = D, so y_{19} = 3-1 =2\n\nt=19 action D: a_{19} = D, so y_{20} =2-1=1\n\nAt t=20, y=1, safe.\n\nThen from here, go up.\n\nBut to avoid the y=7 collision later, we need to time it.\n\nAt t=20 y=1\n\nt=20 action U: a_{20} = U, y_{21} =2\n\nt=21 action U: a_{21} = U, y_{22} =3\n\nt=22 action U: a_{22} = U, y_{23} =4\n\nt=23 action U: a_{23} = U, y_{24} =5\n\nt=24 action U: a_{24} = U, y_{25} =6\n\nNow at t=25 y=6\n\nWe want to go to y=7, but cannot at t=26,27,28.\n\nSo we can stay at y=6 for a few turns.\n\nFor example, at t=25, action S: a_{25} = S, y_{26} =6\n\nt=26 action S: a_{26} = S, y_{27} =6\n\nt=27 action S: a_{27} = S, y_{28} =6\n\nt=28 action U: a_{28} = U, y_{29} =7\n\nAt t=29 y=7, safe (since t=29 not collision time)\n\nThen t=29 action U: a_{29} = U, y_{30} =8\n\nAt t=30 y=8, is it safe? y=8 collision at t=26,27,28,29\n\nt=30, Δt=12, for y=8, collision at Δt=8 to 11, t=26 to 29, so t=30 is Δt=12, not collision, so safe.\n\nThen t=30 action U: a_{30} = U, y_{31} =9\n\nReached at t=31.\n\nBut we can go to y=8 at t=30, then to y=9 at t=31.\n\nTotal from start: actions from t=18 to t=30, so 13 actions, H=13.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach faster by not staying so long at y=6.\n\nSince y=7 is safe at t=29, we can be on y=7 at t=29.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at t=30 or later.\n\nFrom t=25 y=6, if we go U immediately to y=7 at t=26, unsafe.\n\nBut we can go to y=7 at t=29.\n\nHow to spend time before that.\n\nWe can go slower in the lower levels.\n\nFor example, from t=20 y=1, instead of going up every turn, we can stay or go down to delay, but that would take more turns, worse.\n\nSo staying at y=6 is better to delay.\n\nIn the above, we stayed at y=6 from t=25 to t=28, 4 turns at y=6.\n\nBut we only need to avoid being on y=7 at t=26,27,28, so we can be on y=7 at t=29.\n\nFrom t=25 y=6, we can go to y=7 at t=29.\n\nThat means we need to spend 3 turns not on y=7.\n\nFrom t=25 to t=28, we are at y=6, then at t=28 action U to y=7 at t=29.\n\nSo we stay at y=6 for 3 turns: t=25,26,27 actions S, then t=28 U to y=7 at t=29.\n\nIn terms of position:\n\nAt t=25, y=6\n\nAfter a_{25}=S, y_{26}=6\n\na_{26}=S, y_{27}=6\n\na_{27}=S, y_{28}=6\n\na_{28}=U, y_{29}=7\n\nThen a_{29}=U, y_{30}=8\n\na_{30}=U, y_{31}=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut at t=30, y=8 is safe, then to y=9.\n\nNow, is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=8 at t=30, but we are at y=7 at t=29, so y=8 at t=30 is fine.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, we need to start from higher or earlier.\n\nSuppose we don't go down at the beginning.\n\nAt t=18 y=3, safe.\n\nInstead of going down, we stay at y=3 for a turn.\n\nt=18 action S: a_{18}=S, then y_{19}=3\n\nAt t=19, on y=3, safe (only unsafe at t=20)\n\nThen at t=19, we need to choose action for y_{20}.\n\nBut as before, any action leads to unsafe y at t=20.\n\nIf U, y20=4 unsafe\n\nS, y20=3 unsafe\n\nD, y20=2 unsafe\n\nSo must avoid.\n\nUnless we can be on y=6 at t=20, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 is safe at t=20, and we are at y=3, if we could jump, but no.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=0 or y=9 directly, but no.\n\nSo I think going down to y=1 at t=20 is necessary to avoid the t=20 collision.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision for y=3 at t=20.\n\ny=3 at t=20: from earlier, for freeway 3, second car span at t=20: Δt=2, [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], so 0 in span, yes collision.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo no way to be on y=2,3,4,5 at t=20.\n\nSo must be on y=0,1,6,7,8.\n\nSince 6,7,8 not reachable from y=3 in two moves, only y=0 or 1.\n\nSo we go to y=1 at t=20.\n\nThen from there, to reach y=9 in min turns with avoiding later collisions.\n\nNow, from y=1 at t=20, we go up to y=6 as fast as possible, arriving at t=25 y=6, as before.\n\nThen from y=6, we need to go to y=7, but can't before t=29.\n\nt=29 y=7.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=30, y=9 at t=31.\n\nBut at t=30, y=8 is safe, as we said.\n\nWe can go from y=7 to y=8 at t=30, but we are at y=7 at t=29, so y=8 at t=30.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=31.\n\nIs it possible to be on y=8 earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=8 at t=30, which is safe.\n\nBut to be on y=8 earlier, say t=29, but t=29 y=8 is unsafe, since y=8 collision at t=29.\n\nSimilarly, t=30 is safe.\n\nSo we can be on y=8 at t=30.\n\nFrom y=7 at t=29, U to y=8 at t=30.\n\nThen U to y=9 at t=31.\n\nNow, in the sequence, from t=25 to t=28, we are at y=6, waiting.\n\nBut we could have spent more time at lower levels to reduce the waiting, but since we want min turns, going fast to y=6 is better, so we arrive at y=6 earlier and wait there, rather than waiting at lower y.\n\nFor example, if we delay going up from y=1, we arrive at y=6 later, and still have to wait for y=7, so total turns might be more.\n\nIn this case, from t=20 y=1, we go up each turn to t=24 y=5, t=25 y=6, then wait until t=28, then to y=9 at t=31.\n\nArrive at y=6 at t=25.\n\nIf we stay at y=1 for some turns, then we arrive at y=6 later, say at t=26 or later, then we have to wait until at least t=29 for y=7, so we reach y=9 later.\n\nFor example, if at t=20 y=1, we stay one turn: a_{20}=S, y_{21}=1, then a_{21}=U, y_{22}=2, ..., up to y_{26}=6 at t=26.\n\nThen at t=26 y=6, we need to wait until t=29 to go to y=7.\n\nSo stay at y=6: a_{26}=S, y_{27}=6; a_{27}=S, y_{28}=6; a_{28}=U, y_{29}=7; then a_{29}=U, y_{30}=8; a_{30}=U, y_{31}=9, same as before but we started later, reached at same time or later? At t=31 y=9.\n\nIn previous, with no delay, y=6 at t=25, wait t=25,26,27 S, y=6, then t=28 U to y=7 at t=29, etc., to y=9 at t=31.\n\nIf delay at start, we might reach y=6 later, but since we have to wait for t=29 anyway, it might not help.\n\nIn this case, with delay, we reach y=6 at t=26, then wait only two turns: t=26 and t=27 at y=6 (actions S at t=26 and t=27, y=6), then t=28 U to y=7 at t=29, same as before.\n\nBut we started from t=20 later.\n\nt=20 y=1\n\nIf a_{20}=S, y_{21}=1\n\na_{21}=U, y_{22}=2\n\na_{22}=U, y_{23}=3\n\na_{23}=U, y_{24}=4\n\na_{24}=U, y_{25}=5\n\na_{25}=U, y_{26}=6\n\nThen at t=26 y=6\n\na_{26}=S, y_{27}=6\n\na_{27}=S, y_{28}=6\n\na_{28}=U, y_{29}=7\n\na_{29}=U, y_{30}=8\n\na_{30}=U, y_{31}=9\n\nReached at t=31, same as before.\n\nBut in the first sequence, we had a_{20}=U directly, no stay.\n\nIn the first sequence: t=20 y=1, a_{20}=U, y_{21}=2; ... up to a_{24}=U, y_{25}=6; then a_{25}=S, y_{26}=6; a_{26}=S, y_{27}=6; a_{27}=S, y_{28}=6; a_{28}=U, y_{29}=7; a_{29}=U, y_{30}=8; a_{30}=U, y_{31}=9.\n\ny_{31}=9.\n\nIn the delayed sequence, we have an extra action at t=20 S, so we reach later.\n\nFor example, in delayed, at t=30, y=8, then U to y=9 at t=31.\n\nSame as first.\n\nBut in first sequence, with a_{20}=U, we have y=6 at t=25, then wait 3 turns (t=25,26,27 actions S, but actions at t affect y_{t+1}.\n\nIn terms of turns to reach y=9: in both cases t=31.\n\nBut in the delayed, we have one more action at the beginning.\n\nTo min H, we should not have unnecessary stays.\n\nIn the first way, from t=20 to t=30, 11 actions to go from y=1 to y=9 with waiting.\n\nt=20: action, to y=2 at t=21\n\n...\n\nList the actions and positions.\n\nTurn t | action a_t | y_{t+1} | position at turn t is y_t, but for collision, at turn t we are on y_t.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn t: position y_t\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + delta\n\nCollision checked at turn t based on y_t and the cars at that turn.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nStart: t=18, y=3\n\nWe have a_{18} = D (go down)\n\nThen y_{19} = 3 - 1 = 2\n\nt=19, y=2\n\na_{19} = D (go down)\n\ny_{20} = 2 - 1 = 1\n\nt=20, y=1, safe\n\na_{20} = U (up)\n\ny_{21} = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nt=21, y=2, safe (since t>20)\n\na_{21} = U\n\ny_{22} = 3\n\nt=22, y=3, safe\n\na_{22} = U\n\ny_{23} = 4\n\nt=23, y=4, safe\n\na_{23} = U\n\ny_{24} = 5\n\nt=24, y=5, safe\n\na_{24} = U\n\ny_{25} = 6\n\nt=25, y=6, safe\n\nNow, we need to go to y=7, but unsafe at t=26,27,28\n\nSo at t=25, a_{25} = S (stay)\n\ny_{26} = 6\n\nt=26, y=6, safe\n\na_{26} = S\n\ny_{27} = 6\n\nt=27, y=6, safe\n\na_{27} = S\n\ny_{28} = 6\n\nt=28, y=6, safe\n\na_{28} = U\n\ny_{29} = 7\n\nt=29, y=7, safe (t=29 not collision time)\n\na_{29} = U\n\ny_{30} = 8\n\nt=30, y=8, safe (t=30 not collision)\n\na_{30} = U\n\ny_{31} = 9\n\nReached y=9 at turn t=31.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=18 to t=30, that's 13 actions? t from 18 to 30 inclusive is 13 turns, but actions at each turn.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=18 to t=30 for H=13 actions, reaching y_{31}=9.\n\nSince we start at t=18, and after H actions, at turn t=18 + H - 1, we should have y=9.\n\nAfter action at t, we have y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t=18, before action, y=3.\n\nAfter a_{18}, y_{19} set.\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{30}, y_{31}=9.\n\nSo the last action is at t=30, and we reach at turn t=31.\n\nBut the turn when position is 9 is t=31.\n\nIn the min turn, we need the smallest H such that at turn t_1 + H - 1, y=9.\n\nt_1=18, so at turn 18 + H - 1, y=9.\n\nIn this case, at t=31, y=9, so 18 + H - 1 =31, so 17 + H =31, H=14? Let's calculate.\n\nt_1 + H - 1 = target turn.\n\n18 + H - 1 = 31\n\n17 + H =31\n\nH=14\n\nActions from t=18 to t=31? No.\n\nThe actions are at turns t=18 to t=18 + H - 1.\n\nFor example, after H actions, we have set y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, we take action a_t to set y_{t+1}.\n\nStart: turn t=18, y_18 given.\n\nAfter a_18, y_19 set.\n\nAfter a_19, y_20 set.\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t}, y_{t+1} set.\n\nWe want y_{t} =9 for some t.\n\nWhen y_t =9, it means that at turn t, we are at position 9.\n\nFor that, the last action was at t-1, setting y_t.\n\nIn terms of actions, if we reach y_T =9 at turn T, then the last action was at T-1.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, and after the last action, at turn (t_1 + H - 1) + 1 = t_1 + H, we have y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nBut the position at turn t_1 + H is 9.\n\nThe turn when we first reach y=9 is t_1 + H.\n\nIn the task, we need to reach at turn t_1 + H - 1.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nIn this case, for us, y_{31} =9, and t_1=18, so 18 + H - 1 =31, so H-1=13, H=14.\n\nActions from t=18 to t=31? t=31 would be the 14th action? Let's list the action indices.\n\nActions: a_t for t from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter a_{t_1 + H - 1}, y_{t_1 + H} is set to 9.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nSo the sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter executing these actions, at turn t_1 + H - 1, the position is (0,9).\n\nIn terms of the state:\n\nAt turn t_1, position is given.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position at turn t_1 + 1 is updated.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + k}, position at turn t_1 + k + 1 is updated.\n\nWe want position at turn t_1 + H - 1 to be (0,9).\n\nThat means that after action a_{t_1 + H - 2}, position at turn t_1 + H - 1 is set to 9.\n\nOr if H=1, etc.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions at t_1 only, and position at t_1 +1 -1 = t_1 should be 9, but at t_1 it is given, not set by action.\n\nThe actions start from t_1.\n\nAt turn t_1, we take action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 + 1}.\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, we take a_{t_1 +1}, determining y_{t_1 +2}, and so on, up to a_{t_1 + H - 1}, which determines y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nSo for turn t_1 + H - 1, the position is 9, which was set by the previous action a_{t_1 + H - 2}, for H>1.\n\nBut for the turn t_1 + H - 1, we may or may not take an action, but the sequence includes a_{t_1 + H - 1} which determines y_{t_1 + H}, but we don't care about that if we reach at t_1 + H - 1.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} , so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t_1 + t.\n\nAfter executing these actions, the position at turn t_1 + H - 1 is (0,9).\n\nNow, when we execute the actions:\n\n- At turn t_1 + 0, we take action a_{t_1}, which sets y_{t_1 + 1}\n\n- At turn t_1 + 1, take a_{t_1 +1}, set y_{t_1 +2}\n\n- ...\n- At turn t_1 + (H-1), take a_{t_1 + H - 1}, set y_{t_1 + H}\n\nBut we want the position at turn t_1 + H - 1 to be 9.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H - 1, the position y_{t_1 + H - 1} is set by the action at turn t_1 + H - 2, for H>1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then sequence has one action a_{t_1}, which sets y_{t_1 +1}, but we want y_{t_1} =9, which is already given, not set by action. So H=1 only if start at 9.\n\nOtherwise, for reaching, H must be at least the number of steps to move.\n\nIn this case, we start at y=3, so to reach y=9, H at least 6.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + H - 1 is set by the action at turn t_1 + H - 2.\n\nAnd for that position to be 9, the action at t_1 + H - 2 must set it to 9.\n\nThen the last action a_{t_1 + H - 1} is taken, but it sets y_{t_1 + H}, which we don't care about.\n\nIn the sequence, we include a_{t_1 + H - 1}, but it is not used for reaching, it might be for later, but in this case, we stop when reached.\n\nPerhaps for the turn t_1 + H - 1, we take an action, but the position is already set.\n\nTo avoid confusion, in this problem, since we reach at turn t_1 + H - 1, and we output actions up to that turn, including it, but the action at that turn determines the next position, which is after reaching.\n\nBut for collision, at turn t_1 + H - 1, we are at position, and we check collision for that turn.\n\nIn our case, in the sequence, we have actions from t=18 to t=30, 13 actions, H=13, and at turn t_1 + H - 1 = 18 + 13 - 1 = 30, we want y_30=9.\n\nIn our sequence, at turn t=30, we have y_30=8, then action a_30=U, setting y_31=9, so at turn t=30, position is 8, not 9.\n\nWe reach at t=31.\n\nBut we want to reach at turn t=30.\n\nTo reach at turn t=30, we need y_30=9.\n\nThat means that at turn t=29, after action, y_30=9.\n\nSo the action at t=29 sets y_30=9.\n\nThen the sequence includes a_29, but not necessarily a_30.\n\nIn the sequence for H actions, from t=18 to t=18+H-1, and after all, y at turn 18+H-1 is 9.\n\nFor that, the action at 18+H-2 sets y_{18+H-1} if H>1.\n\nBut for turn 18+H-1, we may take an action, but the position is already 9.\n\nIn our case, to have y_30=9, we need to arrive at turn 30.\n\nIn our path, we can adjust.\n\nFor example, from earlier, at t=29, we have y_29=7, then a_29=U to y_30=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=30, we need to be at y=8 at t=29, then U to y=9 at t=30.\n\nBut at t=29, y=8 is unsafe, since y=8 collision at t=29.\n\nWe can be at y=8 at t=30, which is safe, but then U to y=9 at t=31.\n\nTo reach at t=30, we need to be at y=9 at t=30, so at t=29, we must be at y=8 or y=9, but if at y=9 at t=29, we are already there, but we start at 3.\n\nEarliest to reach y=9 is t=24 if no obstacles, but with obstacles, later.\n\nIn our case, with the path, we can have y=8 at t=30, then to y=9 at t=31.\n\nBut we can reach y=9 at t=31.\n\nFor turn t=30, y=8, not 9.\n\nSo to have y=9 at t=30, we need a different plan.\n\nFor example, from y=6, we go directly to y=9, but we have to go through y=7 and y=8.\n\nUnless we can skip, but no.\n\nPerhaps from lower, we can go faster.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5 is safe after t=20, and y=6 safe after t=19, etc.\n\nBut we are stuck with the t=20 issue.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=7 or y=8 before the dangerous times.\n\nFor example, be on y=7 at t=25 or earlier.\n\nBut from start at t=18 y=3, to y=7, need 4 up moves, so at least at t=22.\n\nt=18 y=3\n\nU at t=18, y19=4\n\nU at t=19, y20=5, but at t=20 on y=5 unsafe, so not possible.\n\nIf we can reach y=4 at t=19, then U to y=5 at t=20 unsafe, or if we stay, but still at t=20 unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=5 at t=20.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y=7 before t=20, too far.\n\nEarliest to be on y=7 is t=22, but to be at y=7 at t=22, we need to be at y=6 at t=21, y=5 at t=20, but y=5 at t=20 unsafe, so impossible.\n\nSimilarly, only way is to go down to avoid t=20, then come up.\n\nSo in that case, the minimal H is 14, with reach at t=31.\n\nBut let's confirm the action sequence.\n\nFirst, to reach at turn 30, but we have y=9 at t=31, so for turn 30, we are at y=8.\n\nBut in the sequence, we can stop when we reach, but we need to output the actions until the reach turn.\n\nPerhaps for the reach turn, we output an action, but it might be S or something.\n\nBut to min H, we should not have extra actions.\n\nIn our sequence, we have to take actions until we set the position to 9.\n\nFor example, to have y_t =9 at turn t, we need to have taken an action at t-1 setting it to 9, if t> t_1.\n\nAt t_1, if y=9, no action needed, but here not.\n\nSo in general, to reach at turn T, we need actions from t_1 to T-1, H = T - t_1 actions.\n\nThen at turn T, position is 9.\n\nIn this case, T=31, t_1=18, H=13 actions from t=18 to t=30.\n\nThen at turn 31, y=9.\n\nFor the output, we need to reach at turn t_1 + H - 1.\n\nt_1 + H - 1 = 18 + 13 - 1 = 30, but at turn 30, we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nMistake.\n\nt_1 + H - 1 should be the turn when position is 9.\n\nWith H actions, we reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBecause after H actions, turn is t_1 + H.\n\nAt turn t_1, before actions.\n\nAfter first action, at turn t_1 +1, position set.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k, position set.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position set to 9.\n\nSo we reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nLet's read the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nSo for example, if H=1, reach at turn t_1 +1 -1 = t_1, so must start at 9.\n\nIf H=2, actions at t_1 and t_1+1, reach at turn t_1 +2-1 = t_1 +1.\n\nAfter action at t_1, y_{t_1+1} is set, and at turn t_1+1, position is y_{t_1+1}, which should be 9.\n\nSimilarly, for H actions, after executing a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H - 1}, the position at turn t_1 + H - 1 is 9.\n\nThe action a_{t_1 + H - 1} is executed at turn t_1 + H - 1, which determines y_{t_1 + H}, but for the position at turn t_1 + H - 1, it is already set by previous actions.\n\nAt turn t, when we are at position, we take action a_t to determine y_{t+1}.\n\nFor turn t, position y_t is fixed before action.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo for the position at turn t, it is determined by the state at that turn.\n\nTo have y_T =9 at turn T, it must be that the actions before have led to it.\n\nIn the sequence, for T = t_1 + H - 1, we have y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nAnd the actions are from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H - 1, we take action a_{t_1 + H - 1}, which sets y_{t_1 + H}, but we don't care.\n\nIn our case, for the path, we have y_31=9, so T=31, t_1=18, so 18 + H - 1 =31, thus H-1=13, H=14.\n\nActions from t=18 to t=18+14-1=31? t=18 to t=31, 14 actions.\n\nBut at t=31, we take action, setting y_32, but we already reached at t=31.\n\nSo for t=31, we can take any action, say S, but it doesn't matter.\n\nIn the sequence, we include it.\n\nBut to min H, we should not have extra actions.\n\nIn our sequence, we can reach at t=31 with 13 actions: actions from t=18 to t=30, setting y_31=9.\n\nThen at turn t=31, y=9, but for the sequence, if H=13, then reach at turn t_1 + H - 1 = 18+13-1=30, but at turn 30, y=8, not 9.\n\nSo we must have H such that t_1 + H - 1 =31, so 18 + H -1 =31, H-1=13, H=14.\n\nThen actions from t=18 to t=31.\n\nAt t=31, we take action, but since we are at y=9, we can take S, for example.\n\nBut it adds an extra turn.\n\nTo avoid that, we can reach at turn 30.\n\nHow to reach y=9 at turn 30.\n\nThat means at turn 30, y=9.\n\nSo we need to be at y=8 at turn 29, then U at t=29 to y=9 at t=30.\n\nBut at turn 29, we are at y=8 or something.\n\nIn our path, at t=29, we are at y=7, then U to y=8 at t=30.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=29.\n\nBut t=29, y=8 is unsafe.\n\nWe can be at y=8 at t=30, safe, but then to y=9 at t=31.\n\nIf we want to be at y=8 at t=29, but t=29 y=8 unsafe.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nBe at y=9 at t=29, but from start, impossible.\n\nSo the earliest reach is t=31.\n\nWith H=14 for reach at turn 31.\n\nBut let's list the sequence with H=14.\n\nActions:\n\nt=18: D ( to y=2 at t=19)\n\nt=19: D ( to y=1 at t=20)\n\nt=20: U ( to y=2 at t=21)\n\nt=21: U ( to y=3 at t=22)\n\nt=22: U ( to y=4 at t=23)\n\nt=23: U ( to y=5 at t=24)\n\nt=24: U ( to y=6 at t=25)\n\nt=25: S ( to y=6 at t=26) -- staying\n\nt=26: S ( to y=6 at t=27)\n\nt=27: S ( to y=6 at t=28)\n\nt=28: U ( to y=7 at t=29)\n\nt=29: U ( to y=8 at t=30)\n\nt=30: U ( to y=9 at t=31)\n\nNow, at turn t=30, we have y=8, not 9, and we take action U to go to y=9 at t=31.\n\nBut for the sequence, if we want to reach at turn t=31, with H such that t_1 + H - 1 =31, so 18 + H -1 =31, H=14.\n\nThen actions from t=18 to t=31.\n\nAt t=31, we need to take an action, but since we are at y=9, we can take S, for example.\n\nPosition at turn t=31 is y=9, set by a_30.\n\nThen at t=31, we take a_31, which can be S, setting y_32=9, but it doesn't matter.\n\nIn the sequence, we include a_31.\n\nBut to save, we can have the last action at t=30, reaching at t=31, but for the format, we need to include actions until the reach turn.\n\nWith H=14, actions at t=18 to t=31, and at turn 31, position is 9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=31, we take action, but position at t=31 is already 9 from previous action.\n\nIn the sequence above, after a_30, y_31=9, so at turn t=31, position is 9.\n\nThen we take a_31, which is extra.\n\nFor H=14, actions from t=18 to t=31, 14 actions.\n\nAfter a_30 (t=30), y_31=9, so at turn t=31, y=9.\n\nThen a_31 is taken at t=31, setting y_32, but we don't care.\n\nSo for the output, we can set a_31 to S or something.\n\nBut to min H, H=14 is for reaching at turn 31.\n\nIf we can reach earlier, but we can't.\n\nAnother path: perhaps go to y=9 directly from lower, but no.\n\nOr avoid the waiting by being on y=7 at t=25.\n\nBut to be on y=7 at t=25, from y=3 at t=18, need 4 up moves, but at t=20 must be on y=5 or something, which is unsafe.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSo I think H=14 is the minimal.\n\nThen the sequence is as above.\n\nBut in the output, for turn t=31, we need an action, say S.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nFirst, for freeway 6, at t=18 and 19, unsafe, but in this sequence, we are not on y=6 at those times.\n\nIn the sequence, we are on y=6 from t=25 onwards, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at t=29, safe.\n\netc.\n\nSo the action sequence:\n\nTurn 18: D\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: S\n\nTurn 26: S\n\nTurn 27: S\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nThen for H=14, we need one more action at turn 31.\n\nBut at turn 31, we are at y=9, so a_{31} can be S.\n\nThen the sequence includes up to turn 31.\n\nBut in the sequence, turn 31: S or something.\n\nBut the position at turn 31 is 9, set by previous.\n\nFor the answer, we can output the actions.\n\nBut to make it clear.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter H by not going down.\n\nAnother idea: at t=18, on y=3, safe.\n\nInstead of going down, go up to y=4 at t=19, safe.\n\nThen at t=19, on y=4, instead of moving, but we have to take action.\n\nIf we go down to y=3 at t=20, unsafe.\n\nOr we can go to a row that is safe at t=20.\n\nBut from y=4, we can only go to y=3,4,5, all unsafe at t=20.\n\nUnless we can be on y=6, but no.\n\nSo I think it's impossible to avoid going down or staying with collision.\n\nSo the above sequence seems necessary.\n\nMin H=14.\n\nThen the actions:\n\nTurn 18: D\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: S\n\nTurn 26: S\n\nTurn 27: S\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: S  (since at y=9, we can stay)\n\nBut for turn 31, action a_{31}, which sets y_{32}, but since we reached at turn 31, it might be optional, but for the sequence, we include it.\n\nIn the format, for the reach turn, we output an action, but it can be S.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach with less H.\n\nFor example, from t=18 y=3, if we go U to y=4 at t=19.\n\nThen at t=19, on y=4, we go D to y=3 at t=20, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nOr at t=18, go S, y19=3.\n\nThen at t=19, go S, y20=3, unsafe.\n\nOr go D to y=2 at t=20, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nThen the sequence is as above.\n\nFor the output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: D\nTurn 19: D\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: S\nTurn 26: S\nTurn 27: S\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: S\n}\n\nBut H=14, and reach at turn 31.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at turn 31, but position at turn 31 is 9.\n\nYes.\n\nTo min H, but this seems minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can reduce the waiting at y=6.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=7 at t=29, but we are at y=6 at t=25, we have to wait until t=28 to go to y=7 at t=29.\n\nWe can go to y=8 directly, but no.\n\nOr from lower, delay going up so that we arrive at y=6 later and wait less, but as before, it doesn't save turns.\n\nFor example, at t=20 y=1, we stay one turn: a20=S, y21=1\n\na21=U, y22=2\n\n...\n\na25=U, y26=6\n\nThen at t=26 y=6, we need to wait until t=29 to go to y=7.\n\nSo a26=S, y27=6\n\na27=S, y28=6\n\na28=U, y29=7\n\na29=U, y30=8\n\na30=U, y31=9\n\nThen actions from t=18 to t=30, 13 actions, H=13, reach at turn t_1 + H - 1 =18+13-1=30, but at turn 30, y=8, not 9.\n\nIf we include a30, but with H=13, we have actions to t=30, setting y31=9, but turn 30 position is y30=8.\n\nSo not reached at turn 30.\n\nTo reach at turn 31 with H=13, but t_1 + H -1 =18+13-1=30, not 31.\n\nSo must have H=14 to reach at turn 31.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 18\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions minimizes \\(H = 14\\). This sequence ensures the player reaches (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 18 + 14 - 1 = 31\\), avoiding all collisions based on the car movement and collision rules.\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Collision Avoidance**: The player must not be on a freeway row \\(y\\) at any turn \\(T\\) where a car on that row has a span containing 0. The dangerous times are:\n  - \\(y = 1\\): collision at \\(T = 19\\)\n  - \\(y = 2\\): collision at \\(T = 20\\)\n  - \\(y = 3\\): collision at \\(T = 20\\)\n  - \\(y = 4\\): collision at \\(T = 20\\)\n  - \\(y = 5\\): collision at \\(T = 20\\)\n  - \\(y = 6\\): collisions at \\(T = 18\\) and \\(T = 19\\)\n  - \\(y = 7\\): collisions at \\(T = 26, 27, 28\\)\n  - \\(y = 8\\): collisions at \\(T = 26, 27, 28, 29\\)\n- **Strategy**: \n  - To avoid the collision at \\(T = 20\\) on rows \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\), the player moves down to \\(y = 1\\) by turn 20, which is safe at that turn.\n  - From \\(y = 1\\) at turn 20, the player moves up to \\(y = 6\\) by turn 25, avoiding all collisions on the lower rows.\n  - At \\(y = 6\\), the player stays for three turns (turns 25 to 27) to delay moving to \\(y = 7\\) until after the dangerous period (turns 26–28).\n  - The player then moves up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 29 (safe), \\(y = 8\\) at turn 30 (safe), and \\(y = 9\\) at turn 31.\n- **Minimal Turns**: \\(H = 14\\) is minimal because:\n  - Moving directly upward from \\(y = 3\\) leads to a collision at \\(T = 20\\) on \\(y = 5\\) or nearby rows.\n  - Alternative paths (e.g., staying or moving down temporarily) do not reduce \\(H\\) due to the need to avoid collisions at \\(T = 20\\) and later at \\(T = 26-29\\).\n  - The player must cover a vertical distance of 6 units (from \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 9\\)) but detours to avoid collisions, increasing the minimal path to 14 turns.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}_{t=18}^{31}\\) (for \\(H = 14\\)) is as follows:\n\n- **Turn 18: D**  \n  Move down to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 19. (Safe: \\(y = 3\\) at turn 18 has no collision.)\n- **Turn 19: D**  \n  Move down to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 20. (Safe: \\(y = 2\\) at turn 19 has no collision; \\(y = 1\\) at turn 20 is safe.)\n- **Turn 20: U**  \n  Move up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 21. (Safe: \\(y = 1\\) at turn 20 has no collision; \\(y = 2\\) at turn 21 is safe after \\(T = 20\\).)\n- **Turn 21: U**  \n  Move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 22. (Safe: \\(y = 3\\) at turn 22 has no collision after \\(T = 20\\).)\n- **Turn 22: U**  \n  Move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 23. (Safe: \\(y = 4\\) at turn 23 has no collision after \\(T = 20\\).)\n- **Turn 23: U**  \n  Move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 24. (Safe: \\(y = 5\\) at turn 24 has no collision after \\(T = 20\\).)\n- **Turn 24: U**  \n  Move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 25. (Safe: \\(y = 6\\) at turn 25 has no collision after \\(T = 19\\).)\n- **Turn 25: S**  \n  Stay at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 26. (Safe: avoids \\(y = 7\\) during dangerous turns 26–28.)\n- **Turn 26: S**  \n  Stay at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 27. (Safe: continues avoiding \\(y = 7\\) during dangerous period.)\n- **Turn 27: S**  \n  Stay at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 28. (Safe: continues avoiding \\(y = 7\\) during dangerous period.)\n- **Turn 28: U**  \n  Move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 29. (Safe: \\(y = 7\\) at turn 29 has no collision, as dangerous period ends at turn 28.)\n- **Turn 29: U**  \n  Move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 30. (Safe: \\(y = 8\\) at turn 30 has no collision, as dangerous period ends at turn 29.)\n- **Turn 30: U**  \n  Move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 31. (Reaches goal: \\(y = 9\\) has no cars.)\n- **Turn 31: S**  \n  Stay at \\(y = 9\\) for turn 32. (Action taken at the reach turn; irrelevant as goal is achieved.)\n\n### Verification:\n- Player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 31 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 18 + 14 - 1 = 31\\)).\n- No collisions occur:\n  - Lower rows (\\(y = 1-5\\)): Avoided by moving down to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 20 and moving up after the dangerous turn 20.\n  - \\(y = 6\\): Occupied from turns 25 to 28, safe after turn 19.\n  - \\(y = 7\\): Occupied at turn 29, safe after turn 28.\n  - \\(y = 8\\): Occupied at turn 30, safe after turn 29.\n- \\(H = 14\\) is minimal, as fewer turns would either cause a collision or fail to reach \\(y = 9\\) by the constraints.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: D \\\\\nTurn 19: D \\\\\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: U \\\\\nTurn 22: U \\\\\nTurn 23: U \\\\\nTurn 24: U \\\\\nTurn 25: S \\\\\nTurn 26: S \\\\\nTurn 27: S \\\\\nTurn 28: U \\\\\nTurn 29: U \\\\\nTurn 30: U \\\\\nTurn 31: S\n}",

The note says that when you move to a new y, you're not on that y until the next turn, so you only check the car on your current y at the current turn.\n\nThe player update is: at each turn, you choose an action: U (up, y increases by 1), D (down, y decreases by 1), or S (stay, y same). And y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9, so I have to increase y by 9, but I can go down or stay sometimes to avoid cars, but since I want minimal turns, I probably want to go up as much as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways; the freeways are y=1 to y=8, so only those have cars. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, no cars there. The player starts at (0,0), which is not on a freeway, so at turn t₁=20, I'm at y=0, no car to worry about. Similarly, when I reach y=9, no car.\n\nBut when I'm on y=1 to 8, I need to not be there when a car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars for each freeway.\n\nFor each freeway k, there are cars listed with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right or left. From the update rules:\n\nFor left-moving: span at T is [h - s*(T-t₁), τ - s*(T-t₁)]? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t₁), τ - s*(T-t₁)]\n\nBut in the span, it's given as (head, tail), and for left-moving, it says Span(t₁) = [h, τ], and then [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt], so since it's moving left, decreasing x.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h]? It says: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nI need to interpret what head and tail mean based on direction.\n\nFor direction right: it says Span(t₁) = [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end? Let's see.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h]\" and then Span(T) = [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt], so since it's moving right, τ must be the left end and h the right end, so at t₁, it's from τ to h, with τ < h, and it moves right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt], so here h is the right end? [h, τ] with h > τ, I think, and moving left.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, it says (head, tail), and Span(t₁) = [h, τ], which might imply h is start, but since moving left, h should be the right end.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's define the position at time t.\n\nLet dt = T - t₁ for any turn T >= t₁.\n\nFor a car at freeway k:\n\nIf direction is right: the span at time T is [tail + s*dt, head + s*dt]? From the rule: for right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h], so at t₁, from τ to h, with τ <= h. Then at T, [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, Span(t₁) = [h, τ], and at T, [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt], so since moving left, h is the right end, τ is the left end, so at t₁, from τ to h with τ <= h? [h, τ] with h and τ, but in the span [h, τ], if h > τ, it's from τ to h? No, [h, τ] might be confusing.\n\nI think it's better to think of the span as an interval.\n\nFor example, for left-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [h, τ]\" and then [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt]. Since it's moving left, the values decrease, so at t₁, the car covers from min to max. But [h, τ] could be interpreted as from h to τ, which might be decreasing if h>τ or increasing.\n\nIn the context, for left-moving, h should be the front when moving left, so higher x, and τ lower, so [h, τ] with h > τ, meaning from τ to h, but written as [h, τ] which is unusual; usually we write [min, max].\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nIn the collision condition, we care if 0 is in the span, so we need the min and max of the span at each time.\n\nSo let's define for each car, at time T, the position of the left end and right end.\n\nSet t₀ = t₁ = 20 for simplicity.\n\nFor a car:\n\nIf direction left: at t₁, left end is τ, right end is h, with τ < h? From [h, τ] for left-moving, and h - s*dt to τ - s*dt, so if at t₁, position: left end = τ, right end = h, with τ < h, since moving left, right end is h.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: at t₁, left end = τ, right end = h, with τ < h, moving right.\n\nIn both cases, for any car, at t₁, we have left end L, right end R, with L < R, and direction d, speed s.\n\nThen at time T, if d = left, left end = L - s*(T-t₁), right end = R - s*(T-t₁)\n\nIf d = right, left end = L + s*(T-t₁), right end = R + s*(T-t₁)\n\nAnd L and R are given as part of the state at t₁.\n\nIn the table, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFrom the direction, we can infer which is min and max.\n\nFor direction left: head is the front, so right end, tail is left end.\n\nFor direction right: head is front, so right end, tail is left end.\n\nIn both cases, head is the front of the car, so for left-moving, head is right end, for right-moving, head is right end.\n\nThen tail is always the rear, so left end.\n\nSo for any car, head and tail, with head > tail since it's a span, I assume head and tail are such that |head - tail| is the length, but not necessarily, from the values.\n\nIn the data, let's see.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so at t₁, left end = tail = -95, right end = head = -48? But -48 > -95, so left end -95, right end -48.\n\nThen at time T, left end = -95 + 48*(T-20), right end = -48 + 48*(T-20)\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, e.g., freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, head=48, tail=83? But tail=83, head=48, if tail > head, but in the span, it should be min and max.\n\nFor left-moving, from the rule: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] = [48, 83], but 48 to 83, which is increasing, but it's moving left, so at t₁, it's from 48 to 83, but moving left means decreasing x, so the right end is 83, left end is 48.\n\nYes: head is the front, for left-moving, front is at higher x, so head=83, tail=48? In the table it's (head, tail) = (48,83) for freeway 4, but 48 and 83, with direction left, so head=48, tail=83, but if moving left, head should be at higher x, so here head=48, tail=83, but 48 < 83, so tail is higher, contradiction.\n\nI think there's a mistake in my interpretation.\n\nLook at freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nBut in the car update rule for left-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt]\"\n\nIf Span(t₁) = [h, τ] = [48, 83], so h=48, τ=83, so at T, [48 - s*dt, 83 - s*dt].\n\nSince it's moving left, the car is decreasing x, so at t₁, it is at x from 48 to 83, with 48 left, 83 right? But 48 < 83, so left end 48, right end 83.\n\nThen moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for collision, 0 in span if min <= 0 <= max.\n\nFor this car, at t₁, min=48, max=83.\n\nAt T, min = 48 - 36*(T-20), max = 83 - 36*(T-20)\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, e.g. freeway 2: (48, 37, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFor first car: head=48, tail=37, direction right, so Span(t₁) = [τ, h] = [37, 48]? From the rule: for right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt]\n\nSo [τ, h] = [37, 48], so τ=37, h=48, min=37, max=48 at t₁.\n\nThen at T, min = 37 + 12*(T-20), max = 48 + 12*(T-20)\n\nSimilarly for second car on freeway 2: (0, -11, right, 12), so τ = tail = -11, h = head = 0, so at t₁, min = -11, max = 0.\n\nAt T, min = -11 + 12*(T-20), max = 0 + 12*(T-20)\n\nNow, collision on freeway k at turn T if player is on y=k at turn T and for some car on k, min <= 0 <= max at time T.\n\nAlso, when player moves, at turn T, after action, y_{T+1} is set, but at turn T, player is on y_T, and we check cars on y_T at time T.\n\nIf action at T is U or D, at time T, player is on y_T, then moves to y_{T+1} = y_T ±1, so at time T, we check the car on y_T.\n\nSimilarly for S, same y.\n\nThen at time T+1, we are on y_{T+1}, check cars on y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn t=20, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible, so minimal H such that after H turns, y_{20 + H} = 9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1 relative to t₁, so actions at times t₁, t₁+1, ..., t₁+H-1.\n\nAfter action at t₁+H-1, position at time (t₁+H) is y_{t₁+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t₁+H} = 9.\n\nThe position after action at time t is y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, we perform action a_t, then y_{t+1} is determined.\n\nAt time t, we are at position (0, y_t), and we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at time t, for collision, if y_t is between 1 and 8, we check if there is a car on freeway y_t such that 0 is in its span at time t.\n\nSimilarly for each turn.\n\nFor turn t, when we are at y_t, we need to not collide with cars on y_t at time t.\n\nStart at t=20, y=0, so no collision possible at t=20 since y=0 not freeway.\n\nGoal is to have y_t = 9 for some t, and at that time, if t>20, we need to arrive at y=9, but y=9 is safe, no car.\n\nThe minimal H is the number of actions to go from y=0 to y=9 with up moves, but with obstacles.\n\nSince we can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, the minimal H without cars is 9, by going up each turn.\n\nBut with cars, we might need to wait or go down sometimes, which increases H.\n\nSo H >=9, and I need to find if H=9 is possible, or more.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway k=1 to 8, the cars and their positions over time.\n\nSet t_rel = T - 20, so t_rel >=0, T = 20 + t_rel.\n\nFor each car, at time t_rel, the min and max x for the span.\n\nThen collision on k at t_rel if min <= 0 <= max for some car on k.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, I need to see when 0 is covered by any car on that row.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so at t₁, Span = [τ, h] = [tail, head] = [-95, -48]? tail=-95, head=-48, so min= -95, max= -48 at t_rel=0.\n\nThen at t_rel, min = -95 + 48 * t_rel, max = -48 + 48 * t_rel\n\nCollision if min <= 0 <= max, so -95 + 48 t_rel <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 48 t_rel\n\nSo 48 t_rel <= 48 and 48 t_rel >= 48? Let's solve:\n\n-95 + 48 t_rel <= 0 => 48 t_rel <= 95 => t_rel <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979\n\n0 <= -48 + 48 t_rel => 48 t_rel >= 48 => t_rel >=1\n\nSo for t_rel from 1 to 1.979, since t_rel integer, t_rel=1 or 2? t_rel=1: min = -95 +48 = -47, max = -48 +48 =0\n\nAt t_rel=1, min=-47, max=0, so 0 <=0 is true, min<=0, so 0 in span.\n\nt_rel=2: min= -95 +96 =1, max= -48+96=48, min=1>0, so 0 not <= max? max=48>0, but min=1>0, so 0 < min, not in span.\n\nSo collision at t_rel=1 only for freeway 1.\n\nt_rel=1: min=-47 <=0 <=0= max, yes.\n\nt_rel=0: min=-95<0, max=-48<0, 0 not in span.\n\nt_rel=2: min=1>0, max=48>0, 0 not in span.\n\nSo freeway 1 has collision only at t_rel=1.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48, 37, right, 12) so head=48, tail=37, direction right, so at t_rel=0, min=37, max=48\n\nAt t_rel, min = 37 + 12 t_rel, max = 48 + 12 t_rel\n\nCollision if 37 +12 t_rel <=0 <=48 +12 t_rel, but 37+12t_rel >=37>0 for t_rel>=0, so min>0, never <=0, so 0 never in span for this car.\n\nSecond car: (0, -11, right, 12) head=0, tail=-11, so at t_rel=0, min=-11, max=0\n\nAt t_rel, min = -11 + 12 t_rel, max = 0 + 12 t_rel = 12 t_rel\n\nCollision if min <=0 <= max, so -11 +12 t_rel <=0 and 0 <=12 t_rel\n\nFirst: -11 +12 t_rel <=0 => 12 t_rel <=11 => t_rel <= 11/12 ≈0.916\n\nSecond: 0 <=12 t_rel always for t_rel>=0\n\nSo for t_rel <= 0.916, since t_rel integer, t_rel=0: min=-11<=0<=0=max, yes collision.\n\nt_rel=1: min=-11+12=1>0, max=12>0, min>0, 0 not in span.\n\nSo only at t_rel=0 for this car.\n\nBut freeway 2 has two cars, so collision if either car covers 0.\n\nFirst car never covers 0, as min>0.\n\nSecond car covers 0 at t_rel=0.\n\nt_rel=0 is turn T=20.\n\nBut at turn T=20, if player is on freeway 2, collision.\n\nBut we start at y=0 at t=20, not on freeway 2.\n\nSo for freeway 2, collision at t_rel=0 only, but since we might be on y=2 at other times.\n\nAt any t_rel, for freeway 2:\n\n- At t_rel=0: second car min=-11, max=0, so 0 covered.\n\n- For t_rel>=1, second car min=1 +12(t_rel-1)? At t_rel, min=-11+12t_rel, for t_rel=0: min=-11, max=0\n\nt_rel=1: min=1, max=12\n\nt_rel=2: min=13, max=24, etc., all min>=1>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nFirst car always min>=37>0, so never covers 0.\n\nSo freeway 2 has collision only at t_rel=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nExactly same as freeway 2, so collision only at t_rel=0.\n\nFreeway 4: one car (48,83,left,36)\n\nDirection left, head=48, tail=83, so at t_rel=0, Span = [h, τ] = [48,83], so min=48, max=83?

Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe player is at turn t_1=20, position (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0)\n\nThen we choose actions a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1+H-1} such that after H actions, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAfter action a_t at turn t, position y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nFor collision at turn t: if y_t is between 1 and 8, and there is a car on y_t at turn t covering x=0.\n\nTurn t corresponds to time t, which is t_rel = t - 20.\n\nSet t_index = turn - 20, so t_index from 0 up.\n\nAt time t_index, position y.\n\nt_index=0: turn 20, y=0, safe.\n\nThen we choose action a_{20} for turn 20, which determines y_{21} = y_20 + delta = 0 + delta, so y at time t_index=1.\n\nAfter action at turn 20 (t_index=0), we get to turn 21, t_index=1, position y_{21}.\n\nSimilarly, after action at turn t, we get to turn t+1.\n\nWe want y_{20 + H} =9 for some H.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 20+H.\n\nSince we start at turn 20, after 0 actions, at turn 20.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn 21, etc.\n\nSo to reach turn T with y_T=9, T=20 + H, so H = T - 20.\n\nMinimal H means minimal T such that y_T=9.\n\nT >= 20, y_20=0.\n\ny_T = y_{20 + (T-20)} =9.\n\nSet T = 20 + t, t>=0, y_{20+t} =9 for some t.\n\nt is the time index from start.\n\nAt time t (t_rel), position y_t.\n\nStart t=0, y=0.\n\nEnd when y_t=9 for some t.\n\nt is the number of turns elapsed, so at time t, we have performed t actions? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn 20: t_index=0, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{20}, at turn 21, t_index=1, y_{21} = y_20 + delta_{20}\n\nSimilarly, after action at turn 20+k, at turn 21+k, y_{21+k}\n\nSo at time t_index = k, position y_{20+k}\n\nFor k=0, y_{20} =0\n\nWe want y_{20+H} =9 for some H.\n\nH is the number of actions to reach turn 20+H.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn 20+H.\n\nFor example, after 0 actions, at turn 20.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn 21.\n\nTo reach y=9, it must be at some turn S = 20 + H, y_S=9.\n\nS >=21 since y_20=0, need at least one up to reach y=1, etc., but y=0 to y=9, min 9 up moves, so S >= 20+9 =29 if all up, but we can stay or down, so S >=29.\n\ny_20=0, after 9 up moves, at turn 29, y_29=9.\n\nIf we stay or down, it takes more turns.\n\nSo minimal S is 29 if possible, else more.\n\nNow, at each turn t (meaning turn index, time t_index), for t from 20 to S-1, when we are at that turn, y_t must be safe if between 1 and 8.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, if 1<=y_t<=8, must not have collision at that turn.\n\nTurn t corresponds to time t_index = t - 20.\n\nFor simplicity, let's use t for t_index, so t=0,1,2,... for turns 20,21,22,...\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nt=0: y=0\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T.\n\nT min is 9 if all up, but y_t at t=0 is 0, after first action, at t=1, y1 could be 1 if up, or 0 if stay, etc.\n\nSequence: at time t, we have y_t, then we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision: at time t, when we are at y_t, we check if 1<=y_t<=8 and collision at time t (i.e., t_index=t).\n\nIf we choose to move, at time t, we are on y_t, then we move to y_{t+1}, so at time t, we only care about y_t.\n\nAt time t+1, we care about y_{t+1}, etc.\n\nThe goal is to have y_T=9 for some T.\n\nSince we start at t=0, y=0, and we need to reach y=9, the minimal T is 9, with y_t = t for t=0 to 9? t=0 y=0, t=1 y=1, ..., t=9 y=9.\n\nBut at each time, we need to check if on freeway, collision.\n\nFor t=0, y=0, safe.\n\nt=1, y=1, if on freeway 1, collision at t=1? From above, freeway 1 has collision at t=1.\n\nt=1 time, y=1, freeway 1, collision at t=1, so if we are at y=1 at t=1, collision.\n\nIn the minimal path, if we go up at t=0, then at t=1, y=1, which is freeway 1, and at t=1, collision, so we cannot be there.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nSo let's list for each t and y, if it is safe to be at y at time t.\n\ny from 0 to 9, t from 0 up.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe, no cars.\n\ny=1 to 8 safe only if no collision at that t.\n\nFrom above:\n\nCollision times:\n\ny=1: t=1\n\ny=2: t=0\n\ny=3: t=0\n\ny=4: t=2\n\ny=5: t=2\n\ny=6: t=8,9\n\ny=7: t=0,1,2\n\ny=8: t=16,17,18,19\n\nFor other t, safe.\n\nNow, for each (t,y) with 1<=y<=8, it is unsafe if t is in the collision set for that y.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nNow, we need a path from (t=0,y=0) to some (T,y=9) with minimal T.\n\nEach step, from (t,y_t), we choose action to go to (t+1, y_{t+1}) with y_{t+1} = y_t, y_t-1, or y_t+1, within 0-9.\n\ny_{t+1} must be between 0 and 9.\n\nNow, since we want minimal T, and T min is 9, let's see if T=9 is possible.\n\nAt t=9, y=9.\n\nWe need to go from t=0 y=0 to t=9 y=9.\n\nThe positions at each t must be safe when on freeway.\n\nt=0: y=0, safe.\n\nt=1: y must be set, if we go up, y=1, but at t=1, y=1 unsafe (collision), so cannot be at y=1 at t=1.\n\nIf we stay, y=0 at t=1, but t=1 time, position y1.\n\nAt time t=1, if y1=0, safe, since not freeway.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9, so if we stay at t=0, y1=0, then we are still at start, but time increased.\n\nThen at t=1, y=0, we can choose to go up or down or stay.\n\nBut to reach y=9 fast, we want to go up when possible.\n\nFor t=1, if y=1, unsafe, so we cannot have y=1 at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, at t=0, if we go down, y1=0-1=-1, not allowed, y must be >=0, so cannot go down from y=0.\n\nSimilarly, cannot go up from y=9.\n\nSo actions: from y=0, can only go S or U, not D.\n\nFrom y=9, can only go S or D, not U.\n\nNow back to t=9.\n\nIf we want to reach y=9 at t=9, we need y_t for t=0 to 8.\n\ny0=0\n\ny9=9\n\nSince each step change by at most 1, y_t must increase from 0 to 9 over 9 steps, so it must be that y_t = t for each t, but at t=1, y=1 unsafe, so impossible to have y_t=t for all t because of collision at t=1 y=1.\n\nTherefore, T=9 impossible.\n\nNext, try T=10.\n\nThen we have 10 steps to go from y=0 to y=9, so we must have at least one stay or down, meaning the path is not strictly increasing.\n\ny_t from t=0 to t=10, y0=0, y10=9.\n\nThe net change is +9 over 10 steps, so number of up minus number of down =9, and let S be number of stay, U up, D down, then U + D + S =10, U - D =9.\n\nThen 2U + S =19, S=19-2U, since U >=9, U<=9? U - D =9, U + D + S =10.\n\nFrom U - D =9, U + D + S =10, add: 2U + S =19, subtract: 2D + S =1.\n\nSince U >=9, 2U >=18, so S=19-2U <=19-18=1.\n\n2D + S =1, D and S non-negative integers.\n\nPossible: if D=0, S=1; or D=1, S=-1 impossible; so only D=0, S=1.\n\nThus for T=10, we must have exactly one stay, and 9 up, no down.\n\nSo the path has y_t increasing by 1 each step except one step where it stays.\n\nNow, the stay can be at any time, but y_t must be safe at each t when on freeway.\n\ny_t for t=0 to 10.\n\ny0=0 safe.\n\ny10=9 safe.\n\nNow, for t=1 to 9, y_t between 0 and 9, and if 1-8, must be safe at time t.\n\nSince we have one stay, y_t = min(t, something) but not necessarily.\n\nFor example, if we stay at time k, then y_t = t for t=0 to k, then y_t = k for t=k (stay), then y_t = t-1 for t=k+1 to 10? Let's see.\n\nSuppose at some turn, we stay.\n\nAt time t, we choose action.\n\nIf at time t we choose S, then y_{t+1} = y_t.\n\nOtherwise, U or D changes.\n\nSince we start y0=0, and end y10=9, with one stay and 9 ups.\n\nThe position sequence: let the stay be at step s, meaning that at time s, we choose S, so y_{s+1} = y_s.\n\nBut y_s is the position before action? I think I confused the time.\n\nDefine the state at time t: position y_t.\n\nt=0: y0=0\n\nAfter action at time t, we get y_{t+1}.\n\nFor the path from t=0 to t=10, we have y0, y1, ..., y10.\n\ny0=0, y10=9.\n\nEach step, |y_{t+1} - y_t| <=1.\n\nSince y10 - y0 =9, and 10 steps, with exactly one stay, meaning that for one t, y_{t+1} = y_t, and for 9 t, y_{t+1} = y_t +1, and for 0 t, y_{t+1} = y_t -1, since no down.\n\nSo the values y_t: it increases by 1 for 9 steps, and stays same for one step.\n\nSo the sequence y_t is non-decreasing from 0 to 9, with one plateau where it stays for one extra time.\n\nNow, for each time t from 0 to 9, we have y_t, and we need that if 1<=y_t<=8, it must be safe at time t.\n\nt from 0 to 9, since at time t, position y_t.\n\nThen at t=10, y10=9, safe, no issue.\n\nNow, y_t for t=0 to 9.\n\ny0=0 always safe.\n\nWe need to choose where to have the stay.\n\nThe stay means that at some point, we spend an extra turn at some y level.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=k for two consecutive times.\n\nThen y_t = min(t, k) for t<=k, then at t=k, y_t=k, and if we stay, y_{k+1}=k, then y_t = t-1 for t>k+1? Let's index.\n\nSuppose the stay action is chosen at time s, so that y_{s+1} = y_s.\n\nThen for the positions:\n\n- For t=0 to s: y_t = t  (assuming we go up each time before)\n\n- At t=s, y_s = s\n\n- Then at time s, we choose S, so y_{s+1} = y_s = s\n\n- Then for t=s+1 to 10, we go up each time, so y_t = s + (t - (s+1)) + 1? At t=s+1, y_{s+1} = s\n\nThen from t=s+1 to 10, we go up, so y_{s+1} = s, y_{s+2} = s+1, ..., y_{10} = s + (10 - (s+1)) = s + 9 - s =9, good.\n\nThe times: from t=0 to s, y_t = t\n\nAt t=s+1, y_{s+1} = s\n\nThen for t from s+2 to 10, y_t = s + (t - (s+1)) = s + t - s -1 = t-1\n\ny_t for t from 0 to 10:\n\n- t=0: y0=0\n\n- t=1: y1=1 (if no stay yet)\n\nGenerally, before the stay, y_t = t for t=0 to s.\n\nAt t=s, y_s = s\n\nThen after stay, at t=s+1, y_{s+1} = s (same as y_s)\n\nThen from t=s+2 to t=10, y_t = y_{s+1} + (t - (s+1)) = s + (t - s -1) = t -1\n\nFor example, s=0: stay at t=0, so y0=0, y1=0 (since S at t=0), then y2=1, y3=2, ..., y10=9? y2=1, y3=2, ..., y10=9, but y10=9, but time from t=0 to t=10, y10=9.\n\nt=10, y10=9.\n\nThe positions at time t:\n\nt=0: y0=0\n\nt=1: y1=0 (after stay)\n\nt=2: y2=1\n\n...\n\nt=9: y9=8\n\nt=10: y10=9\n\nNow, we need to check for each t, y_t safe.\n\nSimilarly, if stay at s=1: y0=0, y1=1 (U at t=0), then at t=1, choose S, so y2=1, then y3=2, ..., y10=9\n\ny_t: t=0:0, t=1:1, t=2:1, t=3:2, ..., t=10:9\n\nIn general, for stay at s, meaning we have an extra time at y=s.\n\ny_t = min(t, s) for t <= s+1? From above:\n\n- For t <= s: y_t = t\n\n- For t = s+1: y_t = s\n\n- For t > s+1: y_t = t - 1\n\nt from 0 to 10.\n\ny_t must be safe at time t for t=0 to 9, since at t=10, y10=9 safe.\n\nt=0 to 9 inclusive.\n\nNow, for each possible s from 0 to 9, we can place the stay.\n\ns is the time where we have y_{s+1} = y_s, so s from 0 to 9, but y_{s+1} = y_s, and s+1 <=10.\n\ns=0 to 9.\n\nFor each s, we have the path, and we need all y_t for t=0 to 9 to be safe when on freeway.\n\ny_t for t=0 to 9:\n\n- For t <= s: y_t = t\n\n- For t = s+1: y_t = s\n\n- For t > s+1: y_t = t - 1\n\nt from 0 to 9.\n\nFor t > s+1, y_t = t-1.\n\nNow, we need for each t, if y_t between 1 and 8, safe at time t.\n\nt=0: y0=0, always safe, no issue.\n\nWe need to check t=1 to 9.\n\nNow, list unsafe (t,y) for y=1-8.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\ny=1 unsafe at t=1\n\ny=2 unsafe at t=0\n\ny=3 unsafe at t=0\n\ny=4 unsafe at t=2\n\ny=5 unsafe at t=2\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=8,9\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=0,1,2\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=16,17,18,19 but t max we care is 9 for now, since T=10, t=0 to 9, t=16 etc. not relevant, so y=8 safe for t=0 to 9.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 unsafe at t=8,9, which are within 0-9.\n\nt=0 to 9.\n\ny=8: unsafe only for t>=16, so for t=0-9, safe.\n\ny=7: unsafe at t=0,1,2\n\ny=6: unsafe at t=8,9\n\ny=5: unsafe at t=2\n\ny=4: unsafe at t=2\n\ny=3: unsafe at t=0\n\ny=2: unsafe at t=0\n\ny=1: unsafe at t=1\n\nNow for each s, let's list y_t for t=1 to 9 and check if unsafe.\n\nFirst, s=0: stay at t=0\n\nThen y_t:\n\nt=0:0\n\nt=1: y1=0 (since stay at s=0, y1=0)\n\nt=2: y2=1\n\nt=3: y3=2\n\nt=4: y4=3\n\nt=5: y5=4\n\nt=6: y6=5\n\nt=7: y7=6\n\nt=8: y8=7\n\nt=9: y9=8\n\nNow check for each t=1 to 9:\n\nt=1: y1=0, not freeway, safe\n\nt=2: y2=1, freeway 1, at t=2, is it unsafe? y=1 unsafe only at t=1, not t=2, so safe.\n\nt=3: y3=2, freeway 2, at t=3, unsafe? y=2 unsafe only at t=0, not t=3, safe.\n\nt=4: y4=3, freeway 3, at t=4, unsafe?

But at t=8, y=7, safe, yes.\n\nt=9, y=8, safe.\n\nBut we have y=6 at t=7, safe, but later at t=8 and t=9, y=7 and y=8, not y=6.\n\nIn this path, at t=7, y=6, which is safe since unsafe only at t=8,9.\n\nAt t=8, y=7, safe.\n\nAt t=9, y=8, safe.\n\nAnd we reach y10=9 at t=10.\n\nt=10 is the time, y10=9.\n\nFor the positions at t=0 to 9, all safe.\n\nt=0: y=0 safe\n\nt=1: y=0 safe\n\nt=2: y=1, t=2, y=1 unsafe only at t=1, so at t=2 safe.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nBut at t=2, y=1, freeway 1, collision only at t=1, so at t=2 no collision, safe.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but we need to reach y=9 at t=10, which is fine.\n\nBut is this minimal? T=10, H=10 actions? Let's see.\n\nFrom turn 20 to turn 29, with y at turn 29=9.\n\nTurn 20: t_index=0, y=0\n\nAfter action a20, to turn 21, t_index=1, y21\n\n...\n\nAfter action at turn 28, to turn 29, y29=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 20 to turn 28, actions at t=20 to t=28, 9 actions? Turns: actions at turn t for t=20 to 28, that's 9 actions, to reach turn 29.\n\nGenerally, to reach turn S with y_S=9, we need actions from turn t1 to S-1.\n\nt1=20, S=29 for T=9, but impossible.\n\nHere for S=30? t=10, turn 30.\n\nIn terms of time index.\n\nWe have time t=0 to t=10 for positions y_t.\n\ny_t at time t, for t=0 to 10.\n\nTo have y10=9.\n\nWe used 10 steps from t=0 to t=10.\n\nNumber of actions: at each time t from 0 to 9, we choose an action to go to t+1.\n\nSo actions at t=0 to t=9, 10 actions, to reach y10=9.\n\nIn turn index: actions at turn 20 to 29, to reach turn 30 with y=9.\n\nBut the player position is given at turn 20, which is y20=0.\n\nThen actions a20 to a29, 10 actions, to reach y30=9.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nHere H=10, actions a20 to a29.\n\nBut in the sequence, for s=0 case.\n\nIn this path, with stay at s=0.\n\nAt time t=0, we choose S (stay), so y1=0\n\nThen at t=1, we choose U, y2=1\n\nAt t=2, choose U, y3=2\n\n...\n\nUp to at t=9, choose U, y10=9? y9=8 at t=9, choose U, y10=9.\n\nIn terms of actions:\n\nAt turn 20 (t=0): action S, then y21=0\n\nTurn 21 (t=1): action U, y22=1\n\nTurn 22 (t=2): action U, y23=2\n\nTurn 23 (t=3): action U, y24=3\n\nTurn 24 (t=4): action U, y25=4\n\nTurn 25 (t=5): action U, y26=5\n\nTurn 26 (t=6): action U, y27=6\n\nTurn 27 (t=7): action U, y28=7\n\nTurn 28 (t=8): action U, y29=8\n\nTurn 29 (t=9): action U, y30=9\n\nNow, positions at each time:\n\nTime t=0 (turn20): y=0 safe\n\nt=1 (turn21): y=0 safe\n\nt=2 (turn22): y=1, freeway1, time t=2, collision only at t=1, so safe\n\nt=3 (turn23): y=2, freeway2, time t=3, collision only at t=0, safe\n\nt=4 (turn24): y=3, freeway3, time t=4, safe (only unsafe t=0)\n\nt=5 (turn25): y=4, freeway4, time t=5, unsafe only t=2, safe\n\nt=6 (turn26): y=5, freeway5, time t=6, unsafe only t=2, safe\n\nt=7 (turn27): y=6, freeway6, time t=7, unsafe at t=8,9, not t=7, safe\n\nt=8 (turn28): y=7, freeway7, time t=8, unsafe at t=0,1,2, not t=8, safe\n\nt=9 (turn29): y=8, freeway8, time t=9, unsafe for t=16-19, not t=9, safe\n\nThen at t=10 (turn30): y=9 safe\n\nAll safe, and we reach y=9 at turn 30 with 10 actions.\n\nBut earlier I thought minimal is 9, but not possible, so 10 is minimal possible.\n\nIn this case, with stay at beginning, it works.\n\nBut is there a way with T=9? We saw not, because at t=1, y=1 must be occupied if no stay, but unsafe.\n\nIf we go down or something, but for T=10 we have no down, only one stay.\n\nIn this path, we avoided the unsafe points.\n\nFor example, at t=1, we are at y=0, not y=1, so no problem.\n\nAt t=2, we are at y=1, but t=2, not unsafe for y=1.\n\nSimilarly, other critical points: y=4 and y=5 unsafe at t=2, but in this path, at t=2, we are at y=1, not y=4 or 5.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=8,9, but at t=8, we are at y=7, not y=6; at t=9, y=8, not y=6.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, with H=10, it is possible.\n\nBut the actions: we need to output the sequence.\n\nIn this case, actions: from turn 20 to 29.\n\na20: S\n\na21: U\n\na22: U\n\na23: U\n\na24: U\n\na25: U\n\na26: U\n\na27: U\n\na28: U\n\na29: U\n\nBut we reach at turn 30, y=9.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, it should be from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nH=10, actions at t=20 to 29.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nPerhaps we can have fewer actions if we go down, but with down, it would take more turns, since net up must be +9.\n\nFor example, if we go down at some point, we need extra up, so T>10.\n\nThus minimal H is 10.\n\nIn this path, it works.\n\nBut in the car states, freeway 7 has cars, but at t=8, y=7, which is safe, as we said.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nTo be thorough, let's see if we can reach earlier, but T=9 impossible, so 10 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps with different stay position.\n\nBut here with stay at start, it works.\n\nSuppose we don't stay, but go down or something, but that would require more actions.\n\nFor example, to reach in 10 turns with down, but earlier calculation for T=10 requires no down, only one stay.\n\nIf we have down, for example, U - D =9, with U + D + S =10, then U - D =9, U + D + S=10, so 2U + S=19, 2D + S=1, so D=0, S=1 as before.\n\nCannot have down for T=10.\n\nFor T=11, we could have down, but H larger.\n\nSo minimal is 10.\n\nThus the sequence is as above.\n\nBut in the output, we need for turn t1=20.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 20: S\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nAfter a29, at turn 30, y=9.\n\nBut the sequence has 10 actions, from t=20 to 29.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn 20: S\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\n}\n\nBut let's make sure about the collision at other points.\n\nFor example, at turn 22, time t=2, y=1, freeway 1.\n\nCar on freeway 1: at t_rel=2, which is T=22, t_rel=2.\n\nFreeway 1 car: min = -95 + 48*2 = -95 + 96 =1, max= -48 +96=48, so span [1,48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt turn 23, t=3, y=2, freeway 2.\n\nCars: first car min=37+12*3=37+36=73, max=48+36=84, both >0.\n\nSecond car min=-11+12*3=-11+36=25, max=36, both >0, no car covers 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nAt turn 27, t=7, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nt_rel=7, freeway 6 car: min=-59 +6*7= -59+42= -17, max=-48+42= -6, both negative, 0 not in span, safe.\n\nAt turn 28, t=8, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nt_rel=8, cars: first car min=37+4*8=37+32=69, max=48+32=80>0\n\nSecond car min=-11+4*8=-11+32=21, max=32, both >0, no cover 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 29, t=9, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nt_rel=9, car min=-59 +3*9= -59+27= -32, max=-48+27= -21, both negative, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10, with the sequence above.\n\nBut in the sequence, the first action is S at turn 20, then up all.\n\nPerhaps we can start with up later, but here it works.\n\nTo confirm, if we go up immediately at turn 20, then at turn 21, y=1, t_rel=1, which has collision for y=1, so not possible.\n\nThus we must delay the first up.\n\nBy staying at start, we avoid being on y=1 at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, other choices might work, but this is fine.\n\nSo the answer should be the sequence as above.\n\nBut in the output, it says \"a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\", so t from 0.\n\nIn the box.\n\nSo for t1=20, H=10.\n\nActions:\n\na_{20} = S\n\na_{21} = U\n\n...\n\na_{29} = U\n\nSo in the box.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 20\\) is 10, with the sequence of actions starting from turn 20 to turn 29.\n\n- At turn 20, the action is \\(S\\) (stay), so the player remains at \\(y = 0\\), which is safe as it is not a freeway.\n- From turns 21 to 29, the action is \\(U\\) (up) each turn, increasing \\(y\\) by 1 per turn until reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 30.\n\nThis sequence avoids all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\):\n- At turn 21 (\\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 1\\)), \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway).\n- At turn 22 (\\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 2\\)), \\(y = 1\\): freeway 1 has collision only at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 1\\), so safe at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 2\\).\n- At turn 23 (\\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 3\\)), \\(y = 2\\): freeway 2 has collision only at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 0\\), so safe at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 3\\).\n- At turn 24 (\\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 4\\)), \\(y = 3\\): freeway 3 has collision only at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 0\\), so safe at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 4\\).\n- At turn 25 (\\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 5\\)), \\(y = 4\\): freeway 4 has collision only at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 2\\), so safe at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 5\\).\n- At turn 26 (\\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 6\\)), \\(y = 5\\): freeway 5 has collision only at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 2\\), so safe at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 6\\).\n- At turn 27 (\\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 7\\)), \\(y = 6\\): freeway 6 has collision at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 8\\) and \\(9\\), so safe at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 7\\).\n- At turn 28 (\\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 8\\)), \\(y = 7\\): freeway 7 has collision at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 0, 1, 2\\), so safe at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 8\\).\n- At turn 29 (\\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 9\\)), \\(y = 8\\): freeway 8 has collision at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 16, 17, 18, 19\\), so safe at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 9\\).\n\nReaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 30 is safe, as \\(y = 9\\) has no cars.\n\nA sequence with \\(H = 9\\) is impossible because it would require exactly 9 up actions and no stays or downs, but this would place the player at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 21 (\\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 1\\)), where freeway 1 has a collision.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 21, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8).\n\nThe player can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0) in the y-direction. The grid y ranges from 0 to 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the car on that freeway has its span covering 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) at that exact turn.\n\nImportant note: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is still on y_T. Then at turn T+1, the player moves to y_{T+1}. So at turn T, we only check the freeway y_T for collision. And at turn T+1, we check freeway y_{T+1}.\n\nWe start at y0 = 0 (at turn t1=21) and we are at (0,0). Since y=0 is not a freeway (freeways are y=1..8), we don't check for collision at y=0.\n\nWe must avoid collisions at freeways y=1 to 8 when we are on that row at a given turn.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions from turn 21 onward until we reach y=9.\n\nWe need minimal H (number of turns) and the sequence.\n\nLet me denote the starting turn as t0 = 21.\n\nWe are to compute the car positions at any future turn T (relative to t0). Let Δt = T - t0 = T - 21.\n\nFor each car, we are given:\n- freeway k (row from 1 to 8)\n- one or more cars per freeway (each car has head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nWe note that the car spans are given at turn t0 (21). Then at turn T, the car moves.\n\nFor a left-moving car (direction left): \n  At turn t0: span = [h, τ] (note: h and τ are given, and for left-moving, the head is at the right and tail at left? Actually, note the update: \n  - Left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t0), τ - s*(T-t0)]\n\nBut note the initial span: [h, τ] at t0. Since it's left-moving, the entire car moves left by s per turn.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: [τ, h] at t0? Actually, the table says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then becomes [τ + s*(T-t0), h + s*(T-t0)]. \n\nWait, the table says for right-moving: \n  Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t0), h + s*(T-t0)]\n\nBut in the given data, for freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48) -> so at t0, head is 0? and tail is -47? Then the span is [τ, h] = [-47, 0]? \n\nActually, the table says: for freeway 1: \"(0, -47, right, 48)\" -> so it's (head, tail, direction, speed) but for right-moving, the head is the front? So when moving right, the head (front) is at 0 and tail at -47? Then the span is from tail to head: [-47, 0]. Then at turn T, it becomes [ -47 + 48*(T-21), 0 + 48*(T-21) ].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: freeway 4: (12,47,left,36) -> head=12, tail=47? But for left-moving, the head is the front? Then at t0, the car spans from 12 to 47? But that would be a car of length 35, and moving left: so at turn T, it becomes [12 - 36*(T-21), 47 - 36*(T-21)].\n\nBut note: the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then moves to [h - s*Δt, τ - s*Δt]. So if h=12 and τ=47, then the car is from 12 to 47? That seems backward because if the car is moving left, the head (front) should be at the left? Actually, the problem doesn't specify the meaning of head and tail in terms of left/right. It only gives the update rule.\n\nWe have to stick to the update rule.\n\nFor a car on freeway k at turn t0 (21):\n- Left-moving: initial span [h, τ] -> at T: [h - s*(T-21), τ - s*(T-21)]\n- Right-moving: initial span [τ, h] -> at T: [τ + s*(T-21), h + s*(T-21)]\n\nBut note: the table gives for each car a tuple (head, tail, direction, speed). So:\n\nFor a left-moving car: the span at t0 is [head, tail]? But the update rule for left-moving uses [h, τ] and then subtracts s*Δt from both. Similarly, for right-moving, the update rule uses [τ, h] and then adds s*Δt to both.\n\nSo for freeway 1: (head=0, tail=-47, direction=right, speed=48) -> for a right-moving car, the initial span is [τ, h] = [-47, 0]. Then at turn T, the span is [-47 + 48*(T-21), 0 + 48*(T-21)].\n\nFor freeway 2: two cars: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12). \n  First car: [τ, h] = [49,60]? But wait, the tuple is (head, tail) and for right-moving we use [τ, h] meaning [tail, head]. So for (60,49,right,12): tail=49, head=60? Then the initial span is [49,60]. Then at T: [49+12*(T-21), 60+12*(T-21)].\n\nBut wait, the tuple is given as (head, tail). So for the first car: head=60, tail=49. Then for right-moving, we use [tail, head] = [49,60]. Similarly, the second car: (12,1,right,12) -> [1,12].\n\nSo for freeway 2 at turn T: two cars: [49+12*(T-21), 60+12*(T-21)] and [1+12*(T-21), 12+12*(T-21)].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, we are to avoid being at a freeway row k at turn T when the car on that row at that turn has a span that covers 0. So we require that 0 is not in the span of any car on row k at turn T.\n\nNote: multiple cars per row: we have to check all cars on that row.\n\nWe start at (0,0) at turn 21. We are safe at turn 21 because y=0 is not a freeway.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal number of moves? Since we start at 0 and need to get to 9, and we can only move one step at a time, the minimal number of moves if there were no cars would be 9 moves (all U). But with cars, we might have to wait or detour? However, note that we cannot go above 9 or below 0.\n\nBut we can also move down? But we start at 0 and need to go to 9, so moving down from 0 would go to -1? But the rule says y_{t+1} is clamped to [0,9]. So if we try to go down at 0, we stay at 0? Actually, the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and then it is bounded to [0,9]. So if we are at 0 and do D, then y_{t+1} = max(0, 0-1) = 0. Similarly, at 9 and do U, we stay at 9.\n\nSo we can only move up, down (if not at boundary) or stay.\n\nBut since we are going from 0 to 9, we need at least 9 upward moves. However, we might have to wait (stay) or even move down to avoid a collision and then come back, which would cost more moves. So H might be more than 9.\n\nWe are to minimize H, the total number of turns (including the starting turn? Note: the sequence is from t1 to t1+H-1, so H is the number of turns. We start at turn 21 (index 0) and we need to reach 9 at some turn T (which is turn 21 + (H-1)).\n\nWe must plan the moves so that at each turn T (starting from turn 21) we choose an action, and then the player moves, and then we check: if the player is on a freeway (y in [1,8]) at that turn, then we must avoid collision.\n\nWe can model this as a state (y, time_elapsed) and do a BFS? Since we want minimal turns.\n\nThe state: \n  y: current y-coordinate (0 to 9)\n  t: the current turn (relative to start: turn 0 is 21, turn 1 is 22, etc.)\n\nBut note: the car positions depend on the absolute turn number (which is 21 + t, where t is the number of turns elapsed from the start).\n\nWe start at (y=0, t=0) [meaning turn 21]\n\nWe want to reach (y=9, any t) and we want minimal t (so minimal H = t+1 because we start at turn0 and then take t steps to get to turn t, then we stop at turn t? But note: we are at turn0 at the start, then we take an action to go to turn1? Actually, the problem says: we are at turn t1 (21) and we are to output actions for turns t1, t1+1, ... until the turn we reach 9.\n\nSo the state at step i (i=0,1,...) corresponds to turn t1+i = 21+i.\n\nWe need to simulate for each state (y, i) and the cars at turn 21+i.\n\nThe state space: \n  y: 0..9 -> 10 states\n  i: we don't know the maximum, but we can set a limit? Since we want minimal H, we can do BFS until we reach y=9.\n\nWe start at (y=0, i=0). Then we try actions U, D, S (if applicable) to go to next state (y', i+1). Then check if at the new state (y', i+1) we have a collision? Actually, the collision check is at the turn when we are at that y.\n\nBut note: when we are at state (y, i), that means at turn 21+i, we are at y. Then we choose an action that determines y_{i+1} (at turn 21+i+1). But the collision at turn 21+i is checked at the moment we are at (y, i). \n\nSo when we arrive at (y, i) from a previous state, we must check if at turn 21+i, if y is in [1,8] (freeway), then we must not have any car on that freeway at turn 21+i that has 0 in its span.\n\nBut note: at the start (i=0, y=0) we don't check because y=0 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at the goal (y=9) we don't check because y=9 is not a freeway.\n\nSo algorithm:\n\nWe'll use BFS (queue) for states (y, i) where i is the number of elapsed turns (so absolute turn = 21+i). We start at (0,0) and we want to reach (9, i) for some i.\n\nWe keep a visited set: (y,i) to avoid cycles? But note: we can have cycles (e.g., go up then down then up) but we are minimizing i (total turns), so if we revisit (y,i) with the same i and same y, we skip. But also note: we might have the same y at a later i? But we are doing BFS by i, so the first time we reach (y,i) we have the minimal i for that state.\n\nBut we might reach the same y at a smaller i? Then we don't need to consider a state (y, i) that we've already reached at an earlier i (with the same y and same or earlier i). Actually, since we are doing BFS by i (levels), we only consider states at step i.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a 2D array for each (y, i) and mark the minimal i we reached that y. But since we are going to do BFS in increasing i, we can mark for each y the minimal i we have reached that y? But note: we might need to go through a longer path to avoid a collision? So we cannot prune a state (y, i) just because we have reached y at an earlier i? Because the car positions change over time, so the safety condition is time-dependent.\n\nTherefore, we cannot prune by y only. We must consider (y,i) as distinct states.\n\nBut note: the state space is unbounded in i? However, we can set a large limit? But we want minimal i, so we hope to find a solution with i not too large.\n\nAlternatively, we can use Dijkstra but all step costs are 1, so BFS is fine.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Precompute the car spans for each freeway (row) and for each turn (we need for turn 21+i for i=0,1,...). But we can compute on the fly.\n\n2. We'll simulate i from 0 upwards.\n\n3. We maintain a queue: each element is (y, i, path) where path is the sequence of actions so far (or we can reconstruct by storing parent pointers).\n\n4. We mark visited: (y, i) to avoid duplicates? But note: we might have the same y at the same i by different paths? Then we don't need to store multiple because the state is (y,i) and the future evolution is independent of how we got there. So we can mark (y,i) as visited.\n\nBut note: the car positions are deterministic and the state is (y,i). So yes, we can use a visited set for (y,i).\n\n5. Start: (0,0) -> safe.\n\n6. Then for each state (y,i), we try actions: U, D, S (if applicable: at boundaries, D at 0 and U at 9 have no effect? Actually, the update: y_{i+1} = clamp(y_i + Δy, 0,9). So:\n\n   If we choose U: next_y = min(9, y+1)\n   D: next_y = max(0, y-1)\n   S: next_y = y\n\n7. Then the next state is (next_y, i+1). But before we add it, we must check if at the state (next_y, i+1) we are safe? Actually, no: the state (y,i) is at turn 21+i. Then we choose an action and we move to (next_y) at turn 21+i+1. The collision check for the new state is at turn 21+i+1: if next_y is in [1,8], then we check the cars on freeway next_y at turn 21+i+1.\n\nBut note: we are not checking at the current state (y,i) when we leave? Actually, the current state (y,i) has already been checked when we arrived? Or do we check at the beginning of the turn?\n\nActually, when we are at (y,i) at turn 21+i, we are already present at that row. So we must have been safe at that row at that turn. Then we choose an action that moves us to next_y at the next turn. Then at the next turn (21+i+1), we are at next_y. So we must check the next state (next_y, i+1) for collision at turn 21+i+1.\n\nTherefore, when we generate (next_y, i+1), we check:\n\n   if next_y is 0 or 9 -> safe (not a freeway)\n   else (freeway row k = next_y) -> we get all cars on that row at turn T = 21+i+1, and check if 0 is in any of their spans.\n\nIf safe, then we add (next_y, i+1) to the queue.\n\n8. We stop when we reach next_y=9 at any i+1.\n\nNow, we must compute the car spans at turn T=21+i+1 for the row next_y.\n\nBut note: we have multiple cars per row. We have to check every car on that row.\n\nHow to check: for a given freeway row k and turn T, we have a list of cars (each with head, tail, direction, speed) and we compute their spans at T.\n\nBut note: the car data is fixed for each row at the start.\n\nWe'll pre-store the car data per row.\n\nLet me list the cars per row:\n\nRow 1: one car: (0, -47, right, 48) -> right-moving: initial span at t0 (turn21): [τ, h] = [-47,0]. Then at turn T: span = [ -47 + 48*(T-21), 0 + 48*(T-21) ]\n\nRow 2: two cars: \n   car1: (head=60, tail=49, right, 12) -> initial span [49,60] -> at T: [49+12*(T-21), 60+12*(T-21)]\n   car2: (head=12, tail=1, right, 12) -> initial span [1,12] -> at T: [1+12*(T-21), 12+12*(T-21)]\n\nRow 3: same as row2: two cars: same as row2? \n   (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12) -> same as row2.\n\nRow 4: one car: (12,47,left,36) -> left-moving: initial span [h,τ] = [12,47] -> at T: [12-36*(T-21), 47-36*(T-21)]\n\nRow 5: same as row4: (12,47,left,36) -> same as row4.\n\nRow 6: one car: (-42,-53,right,6) -> right-moving: initial span [τ, h] = [-53,-42] -> at T: [-53+6*(T-21), -42+6*(T-21)]\n\nRow 7: two cars:\n   car1: (52,41,right,4) -> initial span [41,52] -> at T: [41+4*(T-21), 52+4*(T-21)]\n   car2: (4,-7,right,4) -> initial span [-7,4] -> at T: [-7+4*(T-21), 4+4*(T-21)]\n\nRow 8: one car: (-45,-56,right,3) -> initial span [-56,-45] -> at T: [-56+3*(T-21), -45+3*(T-21)]\n\nNow, we have to check for a given row k and turn T (absolute) whether 0 is in any car's span on that row.\n\nNote: the span is an interval [a,b] (with a<=b? For left-moving: [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt] and since h and τ are given, and for left-moving the initial [h,τ] might be such that h<=τ? The example row4: [12,47] -> so 12<=47. Similarly, for right-moving: the initial [τ,h] and the update: [τ+s*dt, h+s*dt] and we have τ<=h? For row1: [-47,0] -> -47<=0. So yes, the span is always [a,b] with a<=b.\n\nSo we can check: 0 in [a,b] if a <= 0 <= b.\n\nSo for a car: if a <= 0 and 0 <= b, then collision.\n\nNow, we can write a function:\n\n   safe(row, T): \n        if row is 0 or 9: return True   (but we don't call for row0 or 9? Actually, we only call for freeway rows 1-8)\n        else:\n            for each car on row:\n                if direction is right:\n                    a = τ + s*(T-21)\n                    b = h + s*(T-21)\n                else: # left\n                    a = h - s*(T-21)\n                    b = τ - s*(T-21)\n                if a <= 0 <= b:\n                    return False\n            return True\n\nBut note: the parameters (h, τ, s, direction) are stored per car.\n\nWe'll store per row a list of cars: each car is (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nBut note: for right-moving cars, we use tail and head to compute a and b? Actually, in the update rule for right, we use τ and h: and τ is the tail and h is the head? Yes, and the tuple given is (head, tail, ...). So:\n\nFor a right-moving car: we have head and tail from the tuple. Then we set:\n   a = tail + s*(T-21)\n   b = head + s*(T-21)\n\nFor left-moving: we have head and tail? Then we set:\n   a = head - s*(T-21)\n   b = tail - s*(T-21)\n\nBut wait: the tuple for left-moving is (head, tail) and the update rule uses [h,τ] -> [h-s*dt, τ-s*dt]. So we set h = head, τ = tail? Then a = head - s*(T-21), b = tail - s*(T-21). But note: the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then becomes [h-s*dt, τ-s*dt]. So if the tuple is (head, tail), then we use head for h and tail for τ.\n\nBut in row4: (12,47,left,36) -> head=12, tail=47. Then at T: [12 - 36*(T-21), 47 - 36*(T-21)]. So the interval is [12-36*dt, 47-36*dt]. This is a car that is moving left and initially covers [12,47]. Then at T=21, dt=0: [12,47]. Then at T=22, dt=1: [12-36, 47-36] = [-24,11]. Then at T=23: [-60, -25], etc.\n\nNow, we can code the BFS.\n\nWe'll simulate until we reach y=9.\n\nWe'll keep a queue: (y, i, actions) where actions is the list of actions so far (from turn21 to turn21+i-1). Actually, the state (y,i) is reached by i moves? Actually, at step i, we have taken i actions and we are at turn21+i.\n\nWe start: (0,0, [])\n\nThen for each state (y, i, path), we generate next states for the three actions.\n\nBut note: we don't need to store the entire path in the state? We can store a parent pointer or a map: best_path[y][i] = (prev_y, prev_i, action) but we are doing BFS by i.\n\nAlternatively, we can store for each (y,i) the action that led to it and the previous state.\n\nBut for simplicity, we can store (y, i, path) and when we reach y=9, we output the path.\n\nHowever, the path length is i, and i might be large? But we are to output the sequence for the minimal H.\n\nWe'll set a limit for i? We know that the minimal moves is 9, but we might have to wait. How long? The cars move and the patterns are periodic? But the speeds are different, so the patterns might be aperiodic? However, we can set a safe limit: the minimal H might be around 20? But we don't know. We can run BFS until we find a solution.\n\nBut note: the grid is small (10 rows) and we can run until i=100? That should be safe.\n\nWe'll do:\n\n   from collections import deque\n   queue = deque()\n   start: (y=0, i=0, path=[])\n   visited = set() # (y,i)\n\n   while queue not empty:\n        pop state (y, i, path)\n        if y == 9: then output path and break.\n\n        for action in ['U','D','S']:\n            next_y = y + delta\n            where:\n                if action=='U': dy = 1\n                if action=='D': dy = -1\n                if action=='S': dy = 0\n            next_y = min(9, max(0, y+dy))\n\n            next_i = i+1\n            next_path = path + [action]\n\n            If (next_y, next_i) in visited: skip\n            Else, check safety at (next_y, next_i): \n                T_abs = 21 + next_i   # because we are at turn 21+next_i at the next state\n                if next_y is in [1,2,...,8]:\n                    if not safe(row=next_y, T_abs): then skip\n                # if next_y is 0 or 9, safe.\n\n            Then add (next_y, next_i, next_path) to queue and mark visited for (next_y, next_i)\n\nIf we break, then we output the sequence.\n\nBut note: the starting turn is 21, and we are at (0,0) at turn21. Then we take the first action at turn21? But the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\".\n\nSo the first action is at t1 (21) and then we move to turn22? And so on.\n\nIn our state, at i=0 we are at (0,0) at turn21. Then we choose an action to go to (y1) at turn22 (i=1). So the first action is chosen at turn21.\n\nTherefore, when we output the path for the sequence, it will be the actions taken at turns 21, 22, ... until the turn when we reach y=9.\n\nBut note: we reach y=9 at the next state? Actually, we are at (y, i) and we choose an action that leads to next_y at i+1. Then if next_y==9, we stop. So the last action is the one that moves us to 9.\n\nBut we must be at 9 at the turn after the last action. So the last action is taken at turn (21 + H-1) and then at turn (21+H-1) we are at 9? Actually, we are at 9 at the next turn? \n\nWait: \n   At turn21: we are at (0,0). Then we take action a_21 at turn21 -> then at turn22 we are at y1.\n   So the state after the first action (at turn21) is at turn22.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at some turn. We are at (0,9) at the turn after the last action.\n\nSo the sequence of actions: \n   Turn21: a_21\n   Turn22: a_22\n   ...\n   Turn21+H-1: a_{21+H-1}\n\nAnd then at turn21+H, we are at (0,9).\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and we reach at turn t1+H-1 the position (0,9). \n\nBut according to the update: \n   After the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we update the position to y_{t1+H} = ... and we require that y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nBut note: at turn t1 (21) we are at (0,0). Then we take H actions: at turns 21, 22, ... 21+H-1. Then at turn 21+H we are at some y. We require that at turn 21+H-1 we are at 9? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nBut let me read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd note: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1: so the actions are taken at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then after the last action, we are at the position at turn t1+H? \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nWait, the definition: \n   Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, we choose a_t, then we set y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nTherefore, at the start (turn t1) we are at y_{t1}=0. Then we choose a_{t1} and then at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}.\n\nWe require that at turn T = t1+H-1, we are at 9? \n\nBut that would be after H-1 actions? Then H would be the number of turns from t1 to the destination turn? \n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and the sequence has H actions? \n\nActually, the sequence is indexed t=0 to H-1: so H actions. Then the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H we are at y_{t1+H}. \n\nWe want y_{t1+H-1} to be 9? \n\nBut the problem says: \"to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nWait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd then: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nSo we require that at the turn when we take the last action (turn t1+H-1) we are at 9? \n\nBut according to the update: we are at y_{t1} at turn t1. Then we take an action a_{t1} and then at turn t1+1 we are at y_{t1+1}. \n\nSo to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1, we must have taken H-1 actions? \n\nBut the sequence has H actions: from t=0 to H-1, so H actions. \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me re-read the problem: \n   \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd then the answer format: \n   Turn t1: a_{t1}\n   Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n   ...\n   Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nSo the last action is at turn t1+H-1. Then after this action, we are at turn t1+H. \n\nBut we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? \n\nBut according to the update rule: at turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}. Then we choose a_{t1+H-1} to get to y_{t1+H}. \n\nSo we want y_{t1+H-1} to be 9? Then we don't need to move? \n\nBut that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, we want y_{t1+H} to be 9? \n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the turn when we are done. \n\nBut note: the collision condition: we are collided only if at a turn T we are on a freeway and the car covers 0. \n\nWe are at (0,9) at the turn when we are at 9? Then we don't check freeway because 9 is not a freeway.\n\nBut the problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". So we only care while we are on y=1..8.\n\nSo we can be at (0,9) at turn t1+H, meaning after H actions.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nWait, in the task: \"minimal number of turns H\" and the sequence has H actions? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning H actions. Then the last action is at turn t1+H-1. Then at turn t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H}. \n\nWe require that y_{t1+H} = 9? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? \n\nI see a discrepancy. \n\nLooking back: \n   \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then in the answer format, we output actions for turns from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nBut note: we start at turn t1 at (0,0). Then we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then at turn t1+H, we are at the new position. \n\nSo we require that at turn t1+H, we are at (0,9). \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem statement. \n\nCheck: the player update: \n   y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at turn t1, we are at y_{t1}=0. \nAfter action a_{t1} (at turn t1), we get y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}.\n\nTherefore, to be at 9, it must be at some turn T >= t1. \n\nThe minimal H is the number of actions required to be at 9 at the turn after the last action. \n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and the sequence has H actions? \n\nAnd then the turn indices for the actions are t1 to t1+H-1. \n\nSo the turn at which we are at 9 is t1+H. \n\nBut the problem does not explicitly say at which turn we must be at 9. \n\nHowever, in the collision condition: we are only concerned for turns from t1 to the turn we are at 9? \n\nBut the collision condition is checked at each turn when we are on a freeway. \n\nSo we are safe at turn t1 (at y=0) and then we are safe at turn t1+H (at y=9) because 9 is not a freeway. \n\nBut the moves in between: we are at y_t at turn t, for t from t1 to t1+H-1? \n\nWait, no: \n   At turn t1: we are at y_{t1}=0 -> safe (not freeway)\n   Then we take action a_{t1} -> then we are at y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1 -> and if y_{t1+1} is in [1,8], then we check at turn t1+1.\n\nSo the turns at which we are on a freeway are from t1+1 to t1+H-1? Because at turn t1+H, we are at 9 -> safe.\n\nBut note: we are at 9 at turn t1+H, so we don't check at turn t1+H? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the turn when we are at 9. \n\nTherefore, we require that at turn t1+H, we are at 9. \n\nAnd the sequence of actions is for the turns t1 to t1+H-1 (H actions) that lead us to 9 at turn t1+H. \n\nTherefore, in our BFS, we want to reach (y=9) at some i (where i = H) such that turn = 21+i = 21+H.\n\nBut note: at the state (y, i), we are at turn21+i. \n\nSo we want a state (9, i) for some i. Then H = i (because the number of actions is i? But we started at i=0 (turn21) and then we took i actions to get to turn21+i? \n\nBut then the number of actions is i? Because from turn21 to turn21+i, we have taken i actions: one per turn. \n\nBut then the last action was taken at turn21+i-1? And then at turn21+i, we are at y=9. \n\nSo the sequence of actions has i actions: from turn21 to turn21+i-1. \n\nTherefore, H = i (the number of turns in the sequence is i) and the last action is at turn21+i-1, and then we are at 9 at turn21+i. \n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and the sequence has H actions. \n\nSo we want minimal i such that we are at (9, i). \n\nAnd then H = i.\n\nBut in our BFS, we start at (0,0) and we want to reach (9,i) for minimal i.\n\nNow, we are ready to code.\n\nBut note: we must check safety at every state (y,i) when y is in [1,8]? \n\nActually, in our BFS, when we arrive at (y,i) we are at turn21+i and at row y. So we must check safety at that state. \n\nBut in our algorithm above, we were checking the next state (next_y, i+1) when generating from (y,i). But we should also check the current state (y,i) when we are popped? \n\nActually, no: because when we are popped at (y,i), we are at turn21+i and we have not taken the action yet? \n\nBut we arrived at (y,i) by a previous action. Then when we were generated to (y,i) from a parent, we checked the safety at (y,i) already? \n\nIn the BFS: \n   We start at (0,0) and we know it is safe (because y=0) so we mark it visited and add to queue.\n   Then we pop (0,0) and generate next states for actions U, D, S: \n        U: next_y = min(9,0+1)=1, i=1\n        D: next_y=0, i=1\n        S: next_y=0, i=1\n\n   Then for each, we check safety at (next_y,1): \n        for next_y=1: we check freeway1 at turn22? \n        for next_y=0: safe.\n\n   Then we add (1,1) and (0,1) if safe.\n\nBut we did not check the state (0,0) because we are at y=0 and safe.\n\nSo when we generate a state (y,i), we check safety at that state (if applicable) before adding to the queue.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n   if next_y is in [1,8]:\n        T_abs = 21 + next_i   # because we are at turn21+next_i\n        if not safe(row=next_y, T_abs): then skip\n   else: safe\n\nBut note: the state (y,i) is at turn21+i. And we are generating it from a parent state at turn21+i-1. So we must check it at turn21+i.\n\nWe'll write a helper function safe(row, T) as described.\n\nNow, we'll code the BFS with a limit on i, say up to 100.\n\nBut we hope to find a solution with i small.\n\nLet me try to compute manually for a few steps? Maybe we can see.\n\nWe start at (0,0) at turn21.\n\nWe want to go to 9. The minimal path: go up 9 times: UUUUUUUUU. But we must check collisions.\n\nCheck the freeways we pass: \n   We will be at y=1 at turn22, y=2 at turn23, ... y=8 at turn29, y=9 at turn30.\n\nSo we need to check freeway k at turn (21 + k) for k=1 to 8? Actually, we are at y=k at turn21+k.\n\nSo we need to check freeway1 at turn22, freeway2 at turn23, etc.\n\nCompute for each:\n\nTurn22 (T=22): freeway1\n   Car: right-moving: a = -47 + 48*(22-21) = -47+48 = 1\n         b = 0 + 48 = 48\n   Span: [1,48]. 0 is not in [1,48] -> safe.\n\nTurn23: freeway2\n   Cars: \n        car1: [49+12*(23-21), 60+12*(23-21)] = [49+24, 60+24] = [73,84] -> 0 not in\n        car2: [1+12*(2), 12+12*(2)] = [1+24,12+24] = [25,36] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nTurn24: freeway3 -> same as freeway2? \n        car1: [49+12*(24-21), 60+12*3] = [49+36,60+36]=[85,96] -> safe\n        car2: [1+12*3,12+12*3]= [37,48] -> safe.\n\nTurn25: freeway4\n   Car: left-moving: a = 12 - 36*(25-21) = 12-36*4 = 12-144 = -132\n         b = 47 - 36*4 = 47-144 = -97\n   Span: [-132,-97] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nTurn26: freeway5 -> same as freeway4: \n        a = 12 - 36*5 = 12-180 = -168\n        b = 47 - 36*5 = 47-180 = -133 -> safe.\n\nTurn27: freeway6\n   Car: right-moving: a = -53 + 6*(27-21) = -53+36 = -17\n         b = -42 + 6*6 = -42+36 = -6\n   Span: [-17,-6] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nTurn28: freeway7\n   Cars:\n        car1: [41+4*(28-21), 52+4*7] = [41+28,52+28]=[69,80] -> safe\n        car2: [-7+4*7, 4+28] = [-7+28,32] = [21,32] -> safe.\n\nTurn29: freeway8\n   Car: a = -56 + 3*(29-21) = -56+24 = -32\n         b = -45+24 = -21 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn30: we are at y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo the minimal path is 9 moves: all U.\n\nTherefore, the sequence for turns 21 to 29 (9 actions) is:\n\n   Turn21: U\n   Turn22: U\n   Turn23: U\n   Turn24: U\n   Turn25: U\n   Turn26: U\n   Turn27: U\n   Turn28: U\n   Turn29: U\n\nAnd then at turn30 we are at 9.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and H is the minimal number of turns. Here H=9? \n\nBut the sequence has 9 actions, so H=9.\n\nBut note: we start at turn21 and take 9 actions: turns21 to 29, and then at turn30 we are at 9.\n\nThe problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? \n\nBut at turn29 (which is t1+9-1 = 21+8=29), we are at y=8? Then we take U to go to 9 at turn30.\n\nSo at turn29, we are not at 9. We are at 8.\n\nTherefore, we must be at 9 at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nSo we must be at 9 at the turn when we take the last action? \n\nThat means we need to be at 9 at the same turn as the last action. \n\nBut the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then we update to y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy. \n\nTo be at 9 at turn t1+H-1, we must have already been at 9 at the beginning of the turn. Then we can choose any action? But then we would have reached earlier.\n\nSo it seems there is a misunderstanding.\n\nRe-read the problem: \n   \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then the answer format: \n   Turn t1: a_{t1}\n   ...\n   Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nand then after the last action, we are at (0,9). \n\nBut the problem also says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\" ? \n\nActually, in the task: \"determine ... to reach (0,9)\" and then in the dynamics, the position is updated at the next turn.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways\" and the collision is checked at the turn when the player is on the freeway.\n\nSo we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H, and we only care about collisions from turn21 to turn21+H-1 (because at turn21 we are at 0 and at turn21+H we are at 9, both safe).\n\nIn the example above, we were safe in the entire path.\n\nTherefore, the sequence for the example is 9 U's.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\" ? \n\nI see: in the problem statement, it says: \"reach (0,9)\" and then in the answer format, we output actions until turn t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? \n\nBut the update rule says otherwise.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that the last action lands us at 9? \n\nThen at turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1} (which might be 8) and then we choose U and then at turn t1+H we are at 9. \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\" is not written. \n\nLooking back, the problem does not explicitly say at which turn we are at 9. \n\nBut in the task: \"to reach (0,9)\", and then the minimal number of turns H. \n\nAnd the sequence has H actions. \n\nAnd after the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we are at the new position at turn t1+H.\n\nSo we require that at turn t1+H, we are at 9.\n\nTherefore, in the example, we are at 9 at turn30 = 21+9.\n\nSo H=9.\n\nAnd the sequence is 9 actions: U from turn21 to turn29.\n\nNow, to confirm, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\" and the actions are taken from turn21 to turn29, and then at turn30 we are at 9.\n\nSo it is correct.\n\nBut in the BFS, we will find a state (9,9) meaning at turn21+9=30, we are at 9.\n\nAnd the actions are the 9 actions that got us there.\n\nTherefore, we can run the BFS and we expect to find a path of length 9.\n\nBut in the BFS, we store the actions.\n\nAlternatively, since the minimal is 9 and we found it safe, we can output the 9 U's.\n\nBut to be safe, let's double-check the safety at each freeway at the designated turns.\n\nWe did above, and it was safe.\n\nBut let me recheck freeway1 at turn22: \n   T=22: car on row1: \n        a = tail + s*(T-21) = -47 + 48*(1) = 1\n        b = head + s*(T-21) = 0 + 48 = 48\n   Span [1,48] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nFreeway2 at turn23 (T=23, dt=2):\n   car1: [49+12*2, 60+12*2] = [49+24,60+24]=[73,84] -> safe\n   car2: [1+24,12+24]=[25,36] -> safe.\n\nFreeway3 at turn24 (dt=3):\n   car1: [49+36,60+36]=[85,96]\n   car2: [1+36,12+36]=[37,48] -> safe.\n\nFreeway4 at turn25 (dt=4):\n   car: left-moving: a = head - s*dt = 12 - 36*4 = 12-144 = -132\n        b = tail - s*dt = 47 - 144 = -97 -> [-132,-97] -> safe.\n\nFreeway5 at turn26 (dt=5):\n   car: [12-36*5, 47-36*5] = [12-180,47-180] = [-168,-133] -> safe.\n\nFreeway6 at turn27 (dt=6):\n   car: a = tail + s*dt = -53 + 6*6 = -53+36 = -17\n        b = head + s*dt = -42 + 36 = -6 -> [-17,-6] -> safe.\n\nFreeway7 at turn28 (dt=7):\n   car1: [41+4*7,52+28]=[41+28,80]=[69,80] -> safe\n   car2: [-7+4*7,4+28]=[-7+28,32]=[21,32] -> safe.\n\nFreeway8 at turn29 (dt=8):\n   car: a = -56 + 3*8 = -56+24 = -32\n        b = -45+24 = -21 -> [-32,-21] -> safe.\n\nSo yes, safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 9 U's.\n\nBut the problem has different cars on different freeways, and we are not required to go through freeways in order? We could go down? But in this case, the direct path is safe and minimal.\n\nSo we output:\n\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\n\nBut note: the minimal H is 9, and the sequence has 9 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and H=9, so t from 0 to 8: 9 actions.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\n}\n\nBut we must ensure that we are within bounds: when we are at y=8 at turn29, we do U and go to 9 at turn30.\n\nAnd we are safe at every freeway as computed.\n\nSo this is the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal sequence to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn 21 without colliding with any cars on freeways y=1 to 8 is achieved by moving upward (U) for 9 consecutive turns. \n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- At turn 21, move up to y=1 (reached at turn 22).\n- At turn 22, move up to y=2 (reached at turn 23).\n- At turn 23, move up to y=3 (reached at turn 24).\n- At turn 24, move up to y=4 (reached at turn 25).\n- At turn 25, move up to y=5 (reached at turn 26).\n- At turn 26, move up to y=6 (reached at turn 27).\n- At turn 27, move up to y=7 (reached at turn 28).\n- At turn 28, move up to y=8 (reached at turn 29).\n- At turn 29, move up to y=9 (reached at turn 30).\n\nCollision checks at each freeway during the path confirm safety:\n- Freeway y=1 at turn 22: Car span [1, 48], 0 not in span.\n- Freeway y=2 at turn 23: Car spans [25, 36] and [73, 84], 0 not in any span.\n- Freeway y=3 at turn 24: Car spans [37, 48] and [85, 96], 0 not in any span.\n- Freeway y=4 at turn 25: Car span [-132, -97], 0 not in span.\n- Freeway y=5 at turn 26: Car span [-168, -133], 0 not in span.\n- Freeway y=6 at turn 27: Car span [-17, -6], 0 not in span.\n- Freeway y=7 at turn 28: Car spans [21, 32] and [69, 80], 0 not in any span.\n- Freeway y=8 at turn 29: Car span [-32, -21], 0 not in span.\n\nThe position (0, 9) is reached at turn 30, which is safe as y=9 is not a freeway.

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 1) on turn t_1 = 22. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each turn, the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 (the x-position) is within the car's span at that turn T. The note says that when you move to a new y, you're not considered on that new y until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and at turn T+1 you're on y+1.\n\nThe car states are given for each freeway. I need to understand how the cars move over time.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway at turn t_1=22.\n\nFor freeway 1 (y=1): one car: head=48, tail=1, direction=right, speed=48. Since it's right-moving, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]. Direction right means it's moving to the right, so positions increase.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, head is the front, tail is the back, so when moving right, head increases, tail increases.\n\nIn the update rule:\n\n- Left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\n- Right-moving: span(t_1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nI think I need to be careful with the notation.\n\nFor freeway 1: cars (48, 1, right, 48)\n\nSince right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [1, 48], I assume? The notation says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h], so yes, [1, 48] at t_1=22.\n\nThen at turn T, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [1 + 48*(T-22), 48 + 48*(T-22)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, player is on freeway k, and 0 is in the span of some car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nPlayer position: at turn T, player has y_T, so if y_T = k, and for freeway k, there is a car with 0 in [min(span), max(span)] at turn T.\n\nSince span might not be ordered, but in the update, for left-moving, it's decreasing, for right increasing, so we need to consider the interval properly.\n\nIn the collision condition, it's \"0 ∈ Span(T)\", and Span(T) is the set of positions covered, so for a car, Span(T) is an interval, and we check if 0 is in that interval.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=1 on turn 22.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I have to move up 8 times, but I can also move down or stay to avoid cars, but since the goal is to minimize turns, I should move up as much as possible, but I have to avoid being on a freeway when a car covers x=0.\n\nAlso, I can stay on the same y or move vertically.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so safe.\n\nPlayer can be on y=0 or y=9 without cars.\n\nBut the goal is (0,9), so when I reach y=9, I'm done.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the times when x=0 is covered by a car.\n\nThat is, for each freeway k, find the times T when there is a car on k such that 0 is in its span at T.\n\nThen, the player must not be on that freeway at that turn T.\n\nSince the player moves one y per turn, I need to plan a path from y=1 to y=9 in min time, avoiding being on a freeway when it's occupied at x=0.\n\nBut the occupancy changes with time.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each freeway the set of T where collision is possible, i.e., 0 is in some car's span.\n\nStart with freeway 1 (y=1):\n\nCar: (48,1,right,48) at t_1=22\n\nSpan at T: [1 + 48*(T-22), 48 + 48*(T-22)] = [48(T-22) +1, 48(T-22) +48]\n\nSet 0 ∈ [48(T-22) +1, 48(T-22) +48]\n\nSince the car is moving right, and at T=22, span [1,48], which is all positive, so 0 is not in [1,48]. As T increases, the span moves right, so [48(T-22)+1, 48(T-22)+48] is increasing, min is 48(0)+1=1 at T=22, then 49 at T=23, etc., all greater than 1, so 0 is never in this span for T>=22. Similarly for T<22, but since we start at T=22, and T increases, for T>=22, 0 is not covered. So freeway 1 is always safe? But at T=22, span [1,48], 0 not included, yes. Since it starts at 1 and moves right, it never covers 0. So for freeway 1, no collision possible at any T>=22. So y=1 is always safe to be on.\n\nIs that right? Span at T=22: [1,48], 0 not in, at T=23: [1+48=49,48+48=96], etc., yes, all positions >=1, so 0 never covered. So freeway 1 has no danger.\n\nNow freeway 2 (y=2):\n\nCars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24,13,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nSince right-moving, span at t_1=22: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? Head and tail: given as (head, tail), so head h=-48, tail τ=-59.\n\nFor right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nThen at T, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-59 + 12(T-22), -48 + 12(T-22)]\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12), head=24, tail=13, so span(t_1) = [13,24] for right-moving? [τ, h] = [13,24]\n\nAt T, [13 + 12(T-22), 24 + 12(T-22)]\n\nNow, collision if 0 in span of first car or second car.\n\nFirst car span: [-59 + 12(T-22), -48 + 12(T-22)]\n\nSet 0 in this interval: min and max, since s>0, the left end is increasing.\n\n-59 + 12(T-22) <= 0 <= -48 + 12(T-22)\n\nSimilarly for the other car.\n\nFirst, for first car:\n\nLet Δt = T - 22\n\nThen span: [-59 + 12Δt, -48 + 12Δt]\n\n0 ∈ [-59 + 12Δt, -48 + 12Δt] if -59 + 12Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 12Δt\n\nSo:\n\n-59 + 12Δt <= 0 => 12Δt <= 59 => Δt <= 59/12 = 4.916, so Δt <= 4 since integer? T is turn, so Δt integer.\n\nT is integer, since turns.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -48 + 12Δt => 12Δt >= 48 => Δt >= 4\n\nAnd -59 + 12Δt <= 0 => 12Δt <= 59 => Δt <= 59/12 = 4 + 11/12, so Δt <= 4 since Δt integer? Δt = T-22, integer.\n\nBut Δt <= 4.916, so for integer Δt, Δt <= 4.\n\nAnd Δt >= 4 from the other inequality.\n\nSo Δt >=4 and Δt <=4, so only at Δt=4.\n\nCheck:\n\nAt Δt=4, -59 + 12*4 = -59 + 48 = -11\n\n-48 + 12*4 = -48 + 48 = 0\n\nSo span: [-11, 0], and 0 is included, since it says \"0 ∈ Span(T)\", and Span(T) includes the endpoints, I assume.\n\nThe span is [left, right], inclusive, so at T-22=4, T=26, span [-11,0], so 0 is included, collision.\n\nAt Δt=3: -59+36= -23, -48+36= -12, span [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=5: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo first car covers 0 only at T=26.\n\nNow second car on freeway 2: (24,13,right,12), span at T: [13 + 12Δt, 24 + 12Δt]\n\nAt Δt=0, [13,24], all positive, so 0 not in, and increasing, so never covers 0. Min is 13 at Δt=0, so always >0, never 0.\n\nSo for freeway 2, only the first car matters, and collision only at T=26.\n\nSo on freeway 2, unsafe at T=26.\n\nOther times safe.\n\nNow freeway 3 (y=3): same as freeway 2? Cars: (-48,-59,right,12) and (24,13,right,12), identical to freeway 2.\n\nSo similarly, only collision at T=26 for the first car.\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): cars: (-24,11,left,36)\n\nDirection left, so left-moving.\n\nHead h=-24, tail τ=11? Given as (head, tail) = (-24,11)\n\nFor left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [-24, 11]? In the rule: \"left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ]\"\n\nThen span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)] = [-24 -36Δt, 11 -36Δt] where Δt = T-22\n\nNow, 0 ∈ [-24 -36Δt, 11 -36Δt]\n\nSince left-moving, positions decreasing.\n\nSet min <= 0 <= max, but since it's decreasing, the left end is decreasing faster.\n\n-24 -36Δt <= 0 <= 11 -36Δt\n\nFirst, 0 <= 11 -36Δt => 36Δt <= 11 => Δt <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so for integer Δt >=0, Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt=0, 0 <= 11, true.\n\nAnd -24 -36*0 = -24 <=0, true.\n\nSo at Δt=0, T=22, span [-24,11], 0 is between -24 and 11? -24 <= 0 <= 11, yes, 0 included.\n\nNow, at Δt=1, span: [-24 -36, 11 -36] = [-60, -25], 0 not in, all negative.\n\nΔt negative not considered.\n\nSo only at T=22, for freeway 4, collision possible.\n\nBut let's confirm: at T=22, span [h,τ] = [-24,11], so positions from -24 to 11, x=0 is included, yes.\n\nNow, is there another car?

Let's list the turns and y in this path:\n\n- T=22: y=1 (safe)\n\nAction U\n\n- T=23: y=2 (safe, since not T=26)\n\nAction U\n\n- T=24: y=3 (safe, not T=26)\n\nAction U\n\n- T=25: y=4 (freeway 4 unsafe only at T=22, so safe at T=25)\n\nAction U\n\n- T=26: y=5 (freeway 5 unsafe at T=22, so at T=26 safe)\n\nBut y=5 is freeway 5, unsafe at T=22 only, so T=26 safe.\n\nAction U\n\n- T=27: y=6 (freeway 6 unsafe at T=28 and 29, so at T=27 safe)\n\nAction U\n\n- T=28: y=7 (freeway 7 unsafe at T=22, so at T=28 safe? T=28 is not 22, so safe)\n\nBut at T=28, y=7, freeway 7 unsafe only at T=22, so yes safe.\n\nAction U\n\n- T=29: y=8 (freeway 8 unsafe at T=36-39, not at 29, so safe)\n\nAction U\n\n- T=30: y=9, safe, done.\n\nIn this, at T=26, y=5, which is safe, but freeway 2 and 3 are unsafe at T=26, but I'm on y=5 at T=26, not y=2 or y=3.\n\ny=2 and y=3 are unsafe at T=26, but I'm not on them at that time.\n\nIn the path above, at T=26, I'm on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, at T=28, y=7, safe.\n\nAt T=29, y=8, and freeway 8 unsafe starting at T=36, so safe.\n\nThen at T=30, y=9, done.\n\nH is the number of turns from t_1, so from T=22 to T=30, that's 8 actions? From T=22 to T=30, I perform actions at T=22 to T=29, 8 actions, and at T=30, I reach y=9.\n\nThe sequence: actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y =9.\n\nIn the player update: after action at t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo to have y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nStart at t_1=22, y=1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nSince each action can increase y by at most 1, min H=8.\n\nIn the above, with all U actions, I can reach at T=30, y=9.\n\nAnd in the path, all positions are safe, as above.\n\nBut let's confirm if there are any issues.\n\nFor example, at T=26, I'm on y=5, which is safe, but y=2 and y=3 are unsafe, but I'm not on them.\n\nSimilarly, at T=28, y=6: freeway 6 unsafe at T=28 and 29.\n\nAt T=28, in the path, I am on y=7? No.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nT=27: y=6 (after action at T=26)\n\nAt T=27, y=6.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe at T=28 and T=29.\n\nAt T=27, is it unsafe? From above, freeway 6 unsafe only at T=28 and 29, so at T=27, safe.\n\nThen action U at T=27, to y=7 at T=28.\n\nAt T=28, y=7.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe only at T=22, so at T=28, safe.\n\nThen action U at T=28, to y=8 at T=29.\n\nAt T=29, y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at T=36-39, not at 29, so safe.\n\nThen action U at T=29, to y=9 at T=30.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut at T=28, freeway 6 is unsafe, but I am on y=7 at that time, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly, at T=29, freeway 6 unsafe, but I am on y=8.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nThus, with H=8, I can reach by going all up.\n\nActions: a_{22} to a_{29} all U.\n\nBut let's list:\n\nTurn t_1=22: U\n\nThen at T=23, y=2\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nT=24, y=3\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nT=25, y=4\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nT=26, y=5\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nT=27, y=6\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nT=28, y=7\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nT=29, y=8\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nT=30, y=9\n\nIn terms of the sequence, actions from t=22 to t=29, 8 actions.\n\nNow, the answer should be the actions starting from t_1.\n\nBut in the path, at T=27, y=6, which is safe, since unsafe at T=28 and 29, not 27.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nBut is there a way to do it faster? H=8 is minimal since I need to increase y by 8.\n\nUnless I can move faster, but I can only change by ±1 or 0, so min 8 moves.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier by moving down or something, but no, moving down would take more turns, so H=8 is minimal.\n\nBut in this case, it seems possible.\n\nBut let me double-check if at any point I am on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nFor example, at T=22, y=1, safe.\n\nT=23, y=2: freeway 2, at T=23, what is the span?\n\nFor freeway 2, cars: first car at T=23, Δt=1, span [-59+12(1)= -47, -48+12(1)= -36]?

[13+12Δt,24+12Δt], at Δt=1, [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nT=24, y=3: similar, freeway 3 same as 2, at T=24, Δt=2, first car [-59+24= -35, -48+24= -24], 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nT=25, y=4: freeway 4, at T=25, Δt=3, span for left-moving car: [ -24 -36*3, 11 -36*3] = [-24-108= -132, 11-108= -97], all negative, 0 not in. Safe.\n\nT=26, y=5: freeway 5, same as 4, at T=26, Δt=4, [ -24-144= -168, 11-144= -133], safe.\n\nT=27, y=6: freeway 6, at T=27, Δt=5, car: [ -47 +6*5, -36 +6*5] = [-47+30= -17, -36+30= -6], span [-17,-6], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nT=28, y=7: freeway 7, at T=28, Δt=6.\n\nFirst car (56,45,right,4): [45 +4*6=45+24=69, 56+24=80], safe.\n\nSecond car: (8,-3,right,4): [-3 +4*6= -3+24=21, 8+24=32], [21,32], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nT=29, y=8: freeway 8, at T=29, Δt=7, car: [-53 +3*7= -53+21= -32, -42+21= -21], span [-32,-21], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nThen T=30, y=9, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought freeway 6 unsafe at T=28, but at T=28 I am on y=7, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly, at T=29, on y=8.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 8, with all actions U.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,1) at turn 22, and after 8 actions, at turn 30, position (0,9).\n\nNow, the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  which is U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +7: a_{t_1+7} U, since t_1 to t_1+7, that's 8 actions.\n\nt_1=22, actions at t=22 to 29, which is t_1 to t_1+7.\n\nH=8, actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1, so indices t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nHere H=8, so actions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+7.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence above, all U.\n\nBut is there a reason to do something else? For example, if I stay or move down, it would take more turns, so worse.\n\nPerhaps I can be faster, but I can't, since min 8 moves up.\n\nAnother thing: at T=26, y=2 and y=3 are unsafe, but in my path, I am on y=5 at that time, not affected.\n\nSimilarly, no conflict.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at T=36,37,38,39, which is later, not relevant for this path.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo the answer should be all U actions for 8 turns.\n\nBut in the output, it should be in the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the answer, it lists the actions, not explicitly H.\n\nBut H is implicit.\n\nNow, for the sequence.\n\nBut let me see if I can do it in less than 8, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps start by staying or something, but that would delay.\n\nFor example, if at T=22, I stay, then at T=23 still y=1, then I need 8 more moves to go to 9, so reach at T=31 or later, worse.\n\nSimilarly, moving down is worse.\n\nSo H=8 is minimal.\n\nThus, the sequence is all U.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 2 and 3, at T=26 unsafe, but since I avoid being there, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I need to avoid T=26 for y=2 and y=3, but in this path, I am on y=2 at T=23, not 26, etc.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nAnother point: the note about moving to a new y.\n\nFor example, when I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I am still on y, so I only check cars on y at that turn.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nFor instance, at T=27, I am on y=6, and I move to y=7 at T=28.\n\nAt T=27, I am on y=6, which is safe at that turn.\n\nThen at T=28, I am on y=7, safe.\n\nNo problem.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 22\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 1\\) is 8, as each upward move increases \\(y\\) by 1, and \\(y\\) must be increased by 8 units.\n- Collision occurs only if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) at turn \\(T\\) and a car on that freeway covers position \\(x = 0\\) at that turn.\n- Based on the car states at \\(t_1 = 22\\) and their movement rules, the unsafe times for each freeway are:\n  - \\(y = 1\\): Always safe (no car covers \\(x = 0\\) for \\(T \\geq 22\\)).\n  - \\(y = 2\\): Unsafe at \\(T = 26\\).\n  - \\(y = 3\\): Unsafe at \\(T = 26\\).\n  - \\(y = 4\\): Unsafe at \\(T = 22\\).\n  - \\(y = 5\\): Unsafe at \\(T = 22\\).\n  - \\(y = 6\\): Unsafe at \\(T = 28\\) and \\(T = 29\\).\n  - \\(y = 7\\): Unsafe at \\(T = 22\\).\n  - \\(y = 8\\): Unsafe at \\(T = 36, 37, 38, 39\\).\n- A sequence of all \"U\" (up) actions reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + 8 = 30\\):\n  - At \\(T = 22\\): \\(y = 1\\) (safe).\n  - At \\(T = 23\\): \\(y = 2\\) (safe, not \\(T = 26\\)).\n  - At \\(T = 24\\): \\(y = 3\\) (safe, not \\(T = 26\\)).\n  - At \\(T = 25\\): \\(y = 4\\) (safe, not \\(T = 22\\)).\n  - At \\(T = 26\\): \\(y = 5\\) (safe, not \\(T = 22\\)).\n  - At \\(T = 27\\): \\(y = 6\\) (safe, not \\(T = 28\\) or \\(29\\)).\n  - At \\(T = 28\\): \\(y = 7\\) (safe, not \\(T = 22\\)).\n  - At \\(T = 29\\): \\(y = 8\\) (safe, not \\(T = 36-39\\)).\n  - At \\(T = 30\\): \\(y = 9\\) (safe, goal reached).\n- This path avoids all unsafe states, and \\(H = 8\\) is minimal since fewer turns cannot achieve the required \\(y\\)-increase.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = t_1 + 7\\) (i.e., turns 22 to 29) is all \"U\":\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 22: U \\\\\nTurn 23: U \\\\\nTurn 24: U \\\\\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: U \\\\\nTurn 28: U \\\\\nTurn 29: U\n}",

But we cannot simply go up every time because of the cars.\n\nWe must simulate the movement and check for collisions at each turn on the freeway we are on (if any) for the entire sequence.\n\nFirst, note that freeways 1 to 8 are dangerous. We are currently at y=2 (freeway 2) at turn 23.\n\nWe need to simulate the car movements. The cars move continuously with their speeds. We are given the state at turn t1=23.\n\nFor each car, we are given (head, tail, direction, speed). Note that the direction indicates the movement.\n\nImportant: the car representation:\n- For a left-moving car: the head is the leftmost part? Actually, the update rule says:\n  - Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  This implies that for a left-moving car, the head is the rightmost? Because as time increases, the car moves left, so the head (which was at h) moves to h - s*(T-t1). So actually, the head is the leading part in the direction of movement? But note the span: at t1, the car occupies [h, τ] but if it's left-moving, then as time goes by, the entire car moves left. However, the representation of the span [h, τ] at t1: if the car is moving left, then at t1 the car is from h (on the right) to τ (on the left) with h > τ? But the example: freeway 4 has (-60, -25, left, 36). Here, h=-60, τ=-25? Then at t1=23, the car spans from -60 to -25? But that's 35 units long? Then at a future turn T, it becomes [ -60 - 36*(T-23), -25 - 36*(T-23) ].\n\nBut note: the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. So the head h is the rightmost? Because when moving left, the entire car shifts left. Similarly, for right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So in that case, the head is the leading part? Actually, for right-moving, the span is given as [τ, h] meaning from τ to h with τ < h? Because then when moving right, it becomes [τ + s*(dt), h + s*(dt)].\n\nSo let me reinterpret:\n\n- For a left-moving car: the head is the rightmost point, and the tail is the leftmost point. So the car at time t1 spans from τ (left) to h (right) with τ < h? But wait, the example: freeway 4: (-60, -25, left, 36). Here h=-60 and τ=-25. But -60 < -25, so that would be [h, τ] = [-60, -25] meaning from -60 to -25? But then the car is moving left: so at T, it becomes [-60 -36*(T-23), -25 -36*(T-23)]. Since -60 < -25, the car is from a lower x to a higher x? Actually, that would be a car from x=-60 to x=-25, which is 35 units long. Then moving left, the entire car moves left.\n\nBut the collision condition: we care about whether x=0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: the representation is (head, tail, direction, speed) but the update rule uses [τ, h] for the span? Actually, the table says for freeway 2: two cars: (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12). But the first car: h=-36, τ=-47? Then the span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-47, -36]. Then at T, it becomes [-47 + 12*(T-23), -36 + 12*(T-23)].\n\nBut note: the second car on freeway2: (36,25,right,12) -> this has h=36, τ=25? Then the span at t1 is [25,36]? But 25<36, so that's a car from 25 to 36.\n\nWait, but the first car: (-36,-47,right,12): h=-36, τ=-47 -> so [τ, h] = [-47, -36]. That is a car from -47 to -36.\n\nSo the representation for a car: regardless of direction, the head and tail are given. For the update, we use:\n- Left-moving: span at T = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]   -> and note that in the initial span [h, τ] we have h and τ? But the example freeway4: h=-60, τ=-25 -> so the initial span is [-60, -25]? But that would be from -60 to -25, which is increasing? So the head is the right end? Then when moving left, the entire segment moves left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: the span at T = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] and the initial span is [τ, h] meaning from τ to h? So in the example freeway2 first car: τ=-47, h=-36 -> so initial span [-47,-36]? Then moving right, it becomes [-47+12*(T-23), -36+12*(T-23)].\n\nSo to avoid confusion, we can compute for any car at turn T (relative to t1=23, so dt = T-23):\n\n- If direction is 'left':\n   left_end = h - s*dt\n   right_end = τ - s*dt   -> but wait, the update rule says [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt]. But if h and τ are given and h < τ? Or h > τ? \n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nFreeway4: (h=-60, τ=-25, left, 36): so the initial span is [h, τ] = [-60, -25]? But then at T, it becomes [-60 -36*dt, -25-36*dt]. But note: if we compute the length: (-25) - (-60) = 35, which is the length. Then the update subtracts the same amount from both, so the length remains.\n\nBut the issue: the order of h and τ. In the update rule for left-moving, it is written as [h, τ] -> [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt]. So the span is from min(h,τ) to max(h,τ)? Or is it from h to τ? \n\nActually, the problem says: for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" meaning an interval from h to τ. But if h > τ, then [h, τ] would be an interval from τ to h? But typically we write [min, max]. However, the update rule then subtracts the same value, so the relative order remains.\n\nBut to be safe, we should consider the car span as the interval [min(h,τ), max(h,τ)]? But the update rule does not change the order: if we subtract the same value, then the min and max remain in the same order? Actually, no: if h and τ are in increasing order, then subtracting the same value keeps the order. But in the example for freeway4: h=-60, τ=-25 -> so h < τ? Then the initial span is [-60, -25]. Then at T, it becomes [-60 -36*dt, -25-36*dt]. So the entire car moves left.\n\nSimilarly, for the right-moving car: freeway2 first car: h=-36, τ=-47 -> so the update rule uses [τ, h] = [-47, -36]. Then at T: [-47+12*dt, -36+12*dt]. So again, the car is from the smaller number to the larger.\n\nTherefore, for any car, we can define the two endpoints and then move them appropriately.\n\nBut note: the problem states the initial span for left-moving as [h, τ] and for right-moving as [τ, h]. So we must use the given order? Actually, the update rule does not depend on which is bigger, because we are just shifting the entire interval.\n\nSo for a car at turn T (with dt = T - 23):\n\n- If the car is left-moving:\n   left_end = h - s*dt\n   right_end = τ - s*dt   -> and then the span is [left_end, right_end] but we don't know which is smaller? Actually, the update rule subtracts the same value, so the relative order of h and τ remains. But in the example, for left-moving, we had h=-60, τ=-25 -> so left_end = -60 - s*dt, right_end = -25 - s*dt -> and since -60 < -25, then left_end < right_end. Similarly, for a left-moving car with h>τ? The problem doesn't specify, but the examples: freeway4: h=-60, τ=-25 -> h<τ.\n\nBut freeway5: same as freeway4: (-60,-25,left,36) -> same.\n\nFreeway6: (-30,-41,right,6): this is right-moving. Here, the update uses [τ, h] -> [ -41 +6*dt, -30+6*dt] -> and -41<-30, so the car is from -41 to -30 at t1, then moves right.\n\nFreeway7: (60,49,right,4) -> wait, h=60, τ=49? Then [τ, h] = [49,60] -> then at T: [49+4*dt, 60+4*dt]. But 49<60, so that's a car from 49 to 60. The second car: (12,1,right,4) -> [1,12] -> moves to [1+4*dt,12+4*dt].\n\nFreeway8: (-39,-50,right,3): [τ, h] = [-50,-39] -> moves to [-50+3*dt, -39+3*dt].\n\nSo it seems that for both left and right moving, the initial span at t1 is given in the form [min, max]? Actually, for left-moving: freeway4: h=-60, τ=-25 -> min=-60, max=-25. For right-moving: freeway2 first car: h=-36, τ=-47 -> then [τ, h] = [-47,-36] -> min=-47, max=-36. Similarly, the second car: h=36, τ=25 -> [25,36] -> min=25, max=36.\n\nBut wait, the representation for a right-moving car: we are given (head, tail, direction, speed). How do we know which is min and max? The update rule uses [τ, h] for the initial span. So if the car is right-moving, we set:\n   initial_min = τ\n   initial_max = h\n\nBut what if τ > h? Then [τ, h] would be [max, min]? That doesn't make sense. The examples: in freeway2, the first car: τ=-47, h=-36 -> so τ < h. The second car: τ=25, h=36 -> τ < h. Similarly, for left-moving: freeway4: h=-60, τ=-25 -> but here h < τ? Then the initial span is [h, τ] = [-60, -25] -> which is [min, max]. So it appears that:\n\n- For a left-moving car: the head is the leftmost? But the update rule subtracts the same value, so the entire car moves left. And the initial span [h, τ] is from h to τ, which in the example is from -60 to -25 -> so h is the left end, τ is the right end? Then the head is the left end? But the problem says \"head\" and \"tail\". \n\nTo avoid confusion, we can compute the span at time T as:\n\nFor a car (head, tail, direction, speed):\n   if direction == 'left':\n        left_end = head - s*(T-23)\n        right_end = tail - s*(T-23)\n   if direction == 'right':\n        left_end = tail + s*(T-23)   # because the update: [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt] -> so the left end is τ + s*dt? But wait: if the car is moving right, the entire car moves right. The initial span is [τ, h] meaning the car is from τ to h. Then at T, it moves to [τ+s*dt, h+s*dt]. So the left end is τ+s*dt and the right end is h+s*dt.\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\". So the left end is τ+s*dt and the right end is h+s*dt.\n\nTherefore, the car occupies the interval [min(left_end, right_end), max(left_end, right_end)]? Actually, in the examples, τ and h are such that τ < h for right-moving? And for left-moving, head and tail: in the example head=-60, tail=-25 -> head < tail? Then the initial span [head, tail] = [-60,-25] which is increasing? Then after moving left, it remains increasing. Similarly for right-moving: τ < h.\n\nSo we can assume that for both types, the initial endpoints are such that the left end is less than the right end? Then the car spans [left_end, right_end] at time T.\n\nTherefore, for any car at time T:\n\n   if direction == 'left':\n        left_end = head - s*(T-23)\n        right_end = tail - s*(T-23)\n   if direction == 'right':\n        left_end = tail + s*(T-23)   # actually, this is the left end? \n        right_end = head + s*(T-23)\n\nBut wait: for a right-moving car, the initial representation at t1: [τ, h] -> and if τ < h, then the car is from τ to h. Then at T, it becomes [τ+s*dt, h+s*dt]. So the left end is τ+s*dt and the right end is h+s*dt.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: [head, tail] at t1, and if head < tail, then the car is from head to tail. Then at T: [head-s*dt, tail-s*dt] -> so the left end is head-s*dt and the right end is tail-s*dt.\n\nBut in the left-moving example, head=-60, tail=-25 -> head < tail, so the car is from -60 to -25.\n\nTherefore, we can define:\n\n   left_end = \n        if left: head - s*(T-23)\n        if right: tail + s*(T-23)\n\n   right_end = \n        if left: tail - s*(T-23)\n        if right: head + s*(T-23)\n\nThen the car occupies [left_end, right_end] (which is an interval from left_end to right_end, and we know left_end <= right_end because initially head<=tail for left and tail<=head for right? Actually, the examples: for left: head=-60, tail=-25 -> head < tail. For right: tail=-47, head=-36 -> tail < head? Yes. Similarly, the other right: tail=25, head=36 -> tail < head.\n\nSo we can rely on: for left-moving: head <= tail? and for right-moving: tail <= head? \n\nLooking at the data:\n\nFreeway1: (96,49,right,48) -> tail=49, head=96 -> so tail < head? Then [τ, h] = [49,96] -> then at T: [49+48*dt, 96+48*dt]. So the car is from 49 to 96 at t1? That's 47 units long? But then it moves right.\n\nBut wait, the problem says for freeway1: (96,49,right,48). This is a right-moving car. Then the initial span is [τ, h] = [49,96]? Then the car is from 49 to 96. Then at T, [49+48*(T-23), 96+48*(T-23)].\n\nSimilarly, freeway2: two cars: (-36,-47,right,12) -> wait, here head=-36, tail=-47 -> but then tail=-47, head=-36 -> so tail < head. Then [τ, h] = [-47,-36] -> then at T: [-47+12*(T-23), -36+12*(T-23)]. The second car: (36,25,right,12) -> head=36, tail=25 -> tail=25, head=36 -> tail < head -> [25,36] -> [25+12*(T-23), 36+12*(T-23)].\n\nFreeway3: same as freeway2.\n\nFreeway4: (-60,-25,left,36) -> head=-60, tail=-25 -> head < tail -> then the car at t1: [head, tail] = [-60,-25]. Then at T: [-60-36*(T-23), -25-36*(T-23)].\n\nFreeway5: same as freeway4.\n\nFreeway6: (-30,-41,right,6) -> head=-30, tail=-41 -> so tail=-41, head=-30 -> tail < head -> [τ, h] = [-41,-30] -> then at T: [-41+6*(T-23), -30+6*(T-23)].\n\nFreeway7: two cars: (60,49,right,4) -> tail=49, head=60 -> [49,60] -> [49+4*(T-23),60+4*(T-23)]. And (12,1,right,4) -> tail=1, head=12 -> [1,12] -> [1+4*(T-23),12+4*(T-23)].\n\nFreeway8: (-39,-50,right,3) -> tail=-50, head=-39 -> [-50,-39] -> [-50+3*(T-23), -39+3*(T-23)].\n\nSo the pattern: for a car (h, t, d, s):\n   if d == 'right': \n        left_end = t + s*(T-23)\n        right_end = h + s*(T-23)\n   if d == 'left':\n        left_end = h - s*(T-23)\n        right_end = t - s*(T-23)\n\nAnd the car occupies the interval [left_end, right_end] (and we know left_end <= right_end).\n\nCollision on freeway k at turn T: if the player is at (0, k) and there is a car on freeway k such that 0 is in [left_end, right_end] of that car.\n\nNote: we only check the freeway we are on at turn T.\n\nWe start at y=2 at turn 23. We must not be at freeway 2 at turn 23 if there is a car on freeway2 that covers 0? Let's check freeway2 at turn 23.\n\nFreeway2 has two cars at turn23:\n\nCar1: (-47+12*0, -36+12*0) = (-47, -36) -> does 0 lie in [-47,-36]? No, because -47 <= 0 <= -36 -> 0 is not in [-47,-36] (since -36 < 0? Actually, -36 is less than 0? Then 0 is not in the interval). \n\nCar2: [25+0, 36+0] = [25,36] -> 0 is not in [25,36]. \n\nSo at turn23, we are safe at y=2.\n\nOur goal: to reach y=9 in minimal turns.\n\nWe can only move one step at a time. We can go up, down, or stay. But we must avoid being on a freeway (y=1..8) at a turn when 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway.\n\nWe are at (0,2) at turn23. We want to get to (0,9). The minimal number of moves in terms of steps: we need 7 upward moves. But we might have to wait (stay) or even move down to avoid collisions, so the total turns might be more than 7.\n\nWe need to plan a path from y=2 to y=9 over turns, avoiding collisions.\n\nWe can use BFS (state: turn and y) to find the minimal H. The state is (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at 23) and y in [0,9]. We want to reach (t, 9) for any t.\n\nBut note: the car positions change with time, so we have to compute for each turn and each freeway the car spans.\n\nThe actions: U, D, S.\n\nWe start at state (23, 2). We want to reach (t, 9) for some t>=23.\n\nWe simulate turn by turn. At each state (t, y), we consider the next action (U, D, S) leading to y' at turn t+1.\n\nBut note: at the current turn t, we are at y. We must check if we are on a freeway (y between 1 and 8) and if so, we check the cars on that freeway at turn t: if any car covers 0, then we collide and that state is invalid.\n\nThen we apply the action to get the next y' at turn t+1.\n\nBut the next state is (t+1, y'). Then at turn t+1, we will check the cars on freeway y' (if y' is between 1 and 8).\n\nWe stop when we reach y=9. And we want the minimal number of turns (H) meaning the number of actions. Since we start at turn23 and take H actions, we end at turn23+H-1? \n\nActually, the sequence of actions: \n   at turn t1 (23): first action -> then at turn24 we are at y1 = y0 + action.\n   so after H actions, we are at turn23+H.\n\nBut the problem says: we start at turn t1, and we take actions at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then at turn t1+H, we are at the position. And we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9)? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning:\n   a_{t1+0}, a_{t1+1}, ... a_{t1+H-1}\n\nThen the player update: \n   y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}   (from action a_{t1})\n   ...\n   y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy_{t1+H-1}\n\nWe require that at the last turn of the sequence, we have y_{t1+H} = 9? But the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd the player position at the end of the sequence: after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we have the position at turn t1+H. But the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nSo the last action is applied at turn t1+H-1, and then at that same turn? No, the position after the action is at the next turn.\n\nActually, the update rule: at turn t, we apply action a_t, and then the new position is at turn t+1.\n\nBut the problem says: at turn t1, we are at (0, y_{t1}) = (0,2). Then we apply a_{t1} and then at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at some turn. The problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis means: we start at turn t1 (23) and we take H actions: at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then at turn t1+H-1, the player is at position (0,9). \n\nBut how? The position at turn t1+H-1 is determined by the previous actions. Specifically:\n\n   turn t1: start at y_{t1} = 2\n   apply a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1: y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n   ...\n   at turn t1+H-1: we are at y_{t1+H-1}. \n\nWe require that y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nSo we do not move at turn t1+H-1? Actually, we take the actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, and then the position at the end of these actions (which is turn t1+H-1) is 9.\n\nBut note: the update rule: the action at turn t determines the next position at turn t+1. Therefore:\n\n   At turn t1: we are at y_{t1}=2.\n   We apply action a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1: y_{t1+1} = 2 + Δy_{t1}.\n   ...\n   We apply action a_{t1+H-2} at turn t1+H-2 -> then at turn t1+H-1: y_{t1+H-1} = ... \n   Then we apply action a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1? But that would then set y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy_{t1+H-1}. \n\nBut the problem says we take actions for t=0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions. And we require y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nThis implies that the last action is applied at turn t1+H-1, but then the position at turn t1+H-1 is the position BEFORE the last action? \n\nThat doesn't match the update rule.\n\nI think there is a confusion in indexing.\n\nThe problem says: \n   \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" \n   and then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nBut the update rule: \n   y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo if we let the actions be taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, then:\n\n   y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n   y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy_{t1+1}\n   ...\n   y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy_{t1+H-1}\n\nWe are interested in the position at the turn when we have just taken the last action? But the problem says we require the position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\nBut from the above, the position at turn t1+H-1 is set by the action at turn t1+H-2. The last action (at turn t1+H-1) sets the position at turn t1+H.\n\nTherefore, to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we must have that the action at turn t1+H-2 leads to 9 at turn t1+H-1. And then we do not need to take the last action? But the problem says we take H actions.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take H actions and then at the end of the H actions, the position is 9. But that would be at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nLooking back: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nSo I think the interpretation is: we take H-1 actions? But the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, which is H actions.\n\nI see the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nThis implies that the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then the position at the same turn (t1+H-1) is 9? But the update rule says the action at turn t sets the position at turn t+1.\n\nThere's a discrepancy.\n\nLooking at the update rule: \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\". So the action at time t affects the position at time t+1.\n\nTherefore, the position at time t is the state BEFORE the action at time t.\n\nBut the problem states: at the current turn (t1) we are at (0, y_{t1}) = (0,2). Then we choose an action a_{t1} which will move us to y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n\nSo if we take H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1), then the last action is at turn t1+H-1, which sets y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut the problem requires y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nThat means we do not take an action at the turn when we are at 9? So we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, and we do not need to move further. But the sequence of actions we take are from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2? Then the number of actions is H-1.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, meaning H actions.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we are at 9 at the turn immediately after the last action? But that would be turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem statement. Let me read the initial description: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd in the answer format, they list actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... up to t1+H-1.\n\nBut then the position after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is at turn t1+H. So to be at 9 at turn t1+H, we require the last action to move us to 9.\n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", which would be the position at the beginning of the last action turn.\n\nTo resolve, I note the example: the current turn is t1=23, we are at y=2. We take an action at turn23, then at turn24 we are at a new y. We want to be at y=9 at one of the turns from 23 onward? But the problem says specifically at turn t1+H-1.\n\nI think the intended meaning is that we start at turn23 and take H actions (so the last action is at turn23+H-1) and then at turn23+H we are at y=9? But that does not match.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of turns H might include the starting turn? But the problem says \"minimal number of turns\", and then we list actions for H turns.\n\nI see the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1). And we require that at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). But how can that be? Because the action at turn t1+H-1 would then change the position.\n\nUnless we are allowed to not take an action at the turn we are at 9? But then we would only take actions until we are at 9. So if we are at 9 at turn t, then we don't need to take an action at turn t.\n\nBut the problem says we take actions until we reach 9, and the last action is taken at the turn before we are at 9? Then the number of actions is the number of turns we are acting, and the total turns elapsed is H (the actions are taken at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1) and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? That doesn't work because the action at turn t1+H-1 would then change the position at turn t1+H.\n\nI think the only logical interpretation is that we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H, after taking H actions. And then the minimal H such that we can achieve that.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nAfter re-examining: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1. This means that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). And then we do not take any action at turn t1+H-1? But the sequence includes an action for turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me look at the collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if ... for any car on freeway y_T\". This happens at the beginning of the turn? And then we take the action.\n\nSo at turn T, we are at position (0, y_T). We check for collision: if y_T is between 1 and 8, and if there is a car on freeway y_T that spans 0 at turn T, then collision.\n\nThen we choose an action a_T, which will update the position to y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nSo the state at turn T is (T, y_T). The action a_T is taken at turn T, and then we move to (T+1, y_{T+1}).\n\nWe start at turn23: (23,2). We want to find a sequence of actions a_{23}, a_{24}, ... a_{23+H-1} such that at turn23+H-1, the player is at (0,9) and has not collided in any turn from 23 to 23+H-1.\n\nBut note: at turn23+H-1, we will check for collision: if the player is at y=9, then we are not on a freeway (since freeways are 1..8), so no collision check. And then we are done.\n\nSo the requirement is: at turn23+H-1, we are at (0,9).\n\nHow do we get there? The last action is taken at turn23+H-2, which moves us to (0,9) at turn23+H-1. Then we do not take an action at turn23+H-1? But the sequence is for actions from turn23 to turn23+H-1, so we would take an action at turn23+H-1 as well, which would then move us away from 9.\n\n This is the issue.\n\nI think the problem means that we take actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H-1, after taking the action, we are at (0,9)? But that would be at turn t1+H.\n\n To match the requirement \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", it would require that we are at 9 before taking the action at turn t1+H-1. Then the action at turn t1+H-1 would be taken while at 9, and might move us away.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal H might be the number of turns from the start until we reach 9, and then we stop. So the actions are taken until we first reach 9. Then the number of actions is the number of turns from 23 to the turn immediately before we are at 9.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and the sequence has H actions.\n\nAfter re-thinking: the problem might mean that H is the number of actions, and after taking these actions, we are at 9 at the next turn. But then the position at turn t1+H is 9.\n\n But the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-}=9\".\n\nI think there is a typo. Probably, it should be y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBecause if we start at turn23, and take 7 actions (H=7) of 'U', then:\n   turn23: start at 2\n   a23: U -> turn24: 3\n   a24: U -> turn25: 4\n   ...\n   a28: U -> turn29: 9\n\n So at turn29, we are at 9. And we took actions from turn23 to turn28 (6 actions?).\n\n Let me count:\n   Actions: a23, a24, a25, a26, a27, a28 -> 6 actions to go from 2 to 8 in 6 steps? Actually, from 2 to 3, then to 4, then to 5, then to 6, then to 7, then to 8, then to 9? That's 7 steps.\n\n So actions: a23 (U) -> turn24:3\n   a24 (U) -> turn25:4\n   a25 (U) -> turn26:5\n   a26 (U) -> turn27:6\n   a27 (U) -> turn28:7\n   a28 (U) -> turn29:8\n   a29 (U) -> turn30:9\n\n But we want to be at 9. So if we are to be at 9 at turn29, then we must have been at 8 at turn28 and then taken U at turn28 to get to 9 at turn29. Or if we are to be at 9 at turn29 without an action, then we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn29, which means we arrived at turn29 from turn28 by an action at turn28.\n\n Therefore, to be at 9 at turn29, we took an action at turn28.\n\n In this case, we took actions at turn23,24,25,26,27,28 -> 6 actions, and then at turn29 we are at 9.\n\n But the problem says the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, so if H=6, then turns: 23,24,25,26,27,28.\n\n Then y_{t1+H-1} = y_{23+6-1} = y_{28} = 8, not 9.\n\n To have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we would need to be at 9 at turn28. That would require that at turn27 we were at 8 or 9 or 10? and then action at turn27: if at 8 and U, then at turn28:9. So then actions taken at turn23 to turn27: 5 actions, and at turn28 we are at 9.\n\n So for the example: from 2 to 9, we need 7 steps upward. But if we do 7 actions of U:\n\n   turn23: start at 2\n   a23: U -> turn24:3\n   a24: U -> turn25:4\n   a25: U -> turn26:5\n   a26: U -> turn27:6\n   a27: U -> turn28:7\n   a28: U -> turn29:8\n   a29: U -> turn30:9\n\n To be at 9 at turn29, we took 6 actions (from 2 to 3, then to 4, then to 5, then to 6, then to 7, then to 8, then to 9: that's 7 actions, last action at turn29).\n\n But then turn29: action at turn29: U, and then at turn30:9.\n\n So to be at 9 at turn29, we must have taken actions only until turn28, and then at turn29 we are at 9. That means we were at 8 at turn28 and took U at turn28 to get to 9 at turn29. So the action at turn28 is the last action, and then at turn29 we are at 9. \n\n Therefore, the sequence of actions is for turns 23 to 28 (6 actions) and then at turn29 we are at 9.\n\n But the problem says the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, so if H=6, then turns23 to 28, and then at turn28 ( after the last action) we are at position for turn29? no, the position after the action at turn28 is at turn29.\n\n The problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 = 23+6-1 = 28, we are at (0,9). But at turn28, before the action, we are at 8. After the action at turn28, we are at 9 at turn29.\n\n So we are not at 9 at turn28.\n\n This is the confusion.\n\n Given the problem explicitly states \"y_{t1+H-}=9\", and our simulation shows that we are at 9 at turn29, not turn28, I think the intended requirement is to be at 9 at turn t1+H, after H actions.\n\n So I will assume that we require y_{t1+H} = 9, and we take actions at turns t1 to t1+H-1 (H actions).\n\n Then the minimal H is the number of actions, and the sequence has H actions.\n\n We start at turn23 at y=2.\n We want to reach y=9 at turn23+H.\n\n We take actions: a_{23}, a_{24}, ... a_{23+H-1} -> then at turn23+H, we are at y=9.\n\n And we must avoid collisions at turns 23, 24, ..., 23+H-1 (because at turn23+H, we are at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision check).\n\n So we need to simulate for states (t, y) where t from 23 to 23+H, and y in [0,9].\n\n We start at (23,2) and want to reach (23+H,9) for some H.\n\n We use BFS in terms of the number of actions (H) or Dijkstra (since actions have no cost, we can do BFS).\n\n The state: (t, y) -> t is the current turn (>=23), y in [0,9].\n\n From state (t, y), we can choose action a in {U, D, S} -> then next state (t+1, y') with y' = y + dy, and y' in [0,9] (clamped? but the problem says y_{t+1} in [0,9] -> so if y=0 and we choose D, then y' = max(0, -1) = 0. Similarly, if y=9 and we choose U, then y' = min(9,10)=9.\n\n But the update rule says: y_{t+1} = y_t + dy, and then it must be in [0,9]. So it's clamped.\n\n But note: the problem says: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\", so we assume clamping.\n\n However, the actions: \n   U: dy=+1, but if y=9, then y'=9.\n   D: dy=-1, if y=0, then y'=0.\n   S: dy=0.\n\n Then, for state (t, y), before we take the action, we must check for collision if y is between 1 and 8: we check the cars on freeway y at turn t.\n\n If there is a collision, this state is invalid and we cannot take any action from it.\n\n Then, after taking the action, we go to (t+1, y').\n\n Then at (t+1, y'), we will check for collision at turn t+1 (if y' is between 1 and 8) when we expand that state.\n\n We start at (23,2). We check collision at (23,2): freeway2, and as we computed, no collision.\n\n Then we consider actions from (23,2): \n   U -> (24,3)\n   D -> (24,1)\n   S -> (24,2)\n\n For each, we then check at the new state (24, y) for collision? Actually, at the new state (24, y), we will check when we pop it from the queue.\n\n We want the minimal H (number of actions) such that we reach (23+H, 9).\n\n So we are doing a BFS over turns and y.\n\n Since the cars move with time, we must compute for each freeway and each turn the car spans.\n\n The turns might go up to 23+H, and H might be up to ...? The cars move, and eventually might move away, but we can bound H. The minimal H is at least 7 (since we need to go up 7 steps). But we might need to wait, so H might be more.\n\n We can simulate until we find a path.\n\n Steps for BFS:\n\n   Let dist[t][y] = the number of actions taken to reach (t,y) from (23,2). We want to find the smallest t' such that y=9 at turn t'.\n\n   We start: dist[23][2] = 0 actions. (turn23, we haven't taken any action yet? But we are at the state at the beginning of turn23.)\n\n   Then at state (t,y), we will take an action, which will take one action and lead to (t+1, y').\n\n   So the number of actions to reach (t+1, y') is dist[t][y] + 1.\n\n   We want to reach a state (t, 9) for any t>=23.\n\n   But note: at the state (t,9), we are at the beginning of turn t, and we are at y=9. Then we don't need to take any further action. However, we have not taken an action to get to (t,9) - the last action was taken at turn t-1.\n\n   The number of actions taken is the number from start to turn t-1, i.e., (t - 23) actions.\n\n   So when we reach (t,9), the number of actions is (t - 23).\n\n   We want to minimize the number of actions, which is (t - 23).\n\n   Or we can stop when we first reach y=9 at any turn, and that gives the minimal actions.\n\n   But note: it might be that by waiting we can get a shorter path in terms of actions? But waiting might increase the turn count, so the number of actions might be the same as the minimal steps (7) or more.\n\n   We do BFS in terms of the number of actions. But the state (t,y) has t increasing, and we care about the number of actions = t - 23.\n\n   So we can do a BFS that is essentially a graph where each state (t,y) has edges to (t+1, y+1), (t+1, y-1), (t+1, y) if within [0,9].\n\n   The edge from (t,y) to (t+1, y') is allowed only if at state (t,y) there is no collision (i.e., if y in [1,8], then no car on freeway y at turn t covers 0).\n\n   And then at (t+1, y') we will also check collision when we consider expanding from it? Actually, we check at the state (t,y) for collision at turn t before taking the action. Then after the action, we are at (t+1, y'), and then when we expand (t+1, y'), we will check for collision at turn t+1.\n\n   So algorithm:\n\n      Let Q be a queue.\n      We start with state (23,2) with actions=0.\n\n      while Q not empty:\n          pop state (t,y) with actions = act.\n          if y == 9: \n               then minimal actions is act, and we can reconstruct the path.\n          If y is between 1 and 8, then check for collision at turn t on freeway y:\n               if there is any car on freeway y that has 0 in its span at turn t, then skip this state (or mark as invalid, so we don't expand from it).\n          Otherwise (y==0 or y==9 or not collision) -> then we can expand to next states.\n\n          But note: at state (t,y), we are at the beginning of turn t. We check for collision at this turn (if applicable). If there is a collision, we cannot take any action from this state -> so this state is invalid.\n\n          If not, then we take an action (U, D, S) and go to (t+1, y') for y' = clamp(y+dy,0,9).\n\n          And the number of actions for (t+1, y') will be act+1.\n\n          We then push (t+1, y') with actions act+1 and also record the action taken and the parent.\n\n      We must avoid revisiting states with a higher or equal action count? But the same (t,y) will only be reached once because t increases.\n\n      However, we might reach the same (t,y) by different paths, but since t is increasing, we only visit each (t,y) once.\n\n      But note: we might have cycles? For example, go up and down repeatedly. We might get (t1,y) and then later (t2,y) with t2>t1. But we want the minimal actions, and BFS by increasing t will find the minimal actions (since each action increases t by 1).\n\n      We can use a visited array for states (t,y) to avoid re-expanding the same state.\n\n      But since t increases and we care about the first time we reach y=9, we can break when we find a state with y=9.\n\n      However, it is possible that a path with more actions might be found first, but since we are BFS by t (which is the same as actions), we will find the minimal actions.\n\n      Actually, we are expanding by increasing t, so the first time we reach y=9, the number of actions (t-23) is minimized.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We will simulate turns starting from 23 upwards.\n\n   We need to compute for each freeway and for each turn t (from 23 up to some bound) the car spans.\n\n   But the bound for t: we don't know. We can compute on the fly. The minimal actions is at least 7, and we might need to wait, but eventually the cars move away. We can set a bound, say up to turn 23+100.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute the car spans at a given turn t when needed.\n\n   Steps:\n\n      Let's define a function is_safe(t, y) -> bool: \n          if y==0 or y==9: then safe (no freeway) -> return True.\n          else: for freeway y, for each car on freeway y, compute its span at turn t and check if 0 is in [left_end, right_end].\n\n      We'll use the car data as given.\n\n   Car data per freeway:\n\n      freeway1: one car: (96,49,right,48) -> \n          left_end = 49 + 48*(t-23)\n          right_end = 96 + 48*(t-23)\n\n      freeway2: two cars: \n          car1: (head=-36, tail=-47, right,12) -> \n               left_end = -47 + 12*(t-23)\n               right_end = -36 + 12*(t-23)\n          car2: (36,25,right,12) ->\n               left_end = 25 + 12*(t-23)\n               right_end = 36 + 12*(t-23)\n\n      freeway3: same as freeway2.\n\n      freeway4: (-60,-25,left,36) ->\n          left_end = -60 - 36*(t-23)\n          right_end = -25 - 36*(t-23)\n\n      freeway5: same as freeway4.\n\n      freeway6: (-30,-41,right,6) -> \n          left_end = -41 + 6*(t-23)\n          right_end = -30 + 6*(t-23)\n\n      freeway7: two cars:\n          car1: (60,49,right,4) -> \n               left_end = 49 + 4*(t-23)\n               right_end = 60 + 4*(t-23)\n          car2: (12,1,right,4) ->\n               left_end = 1 + 4*(t-23)\n               right_end = 12 + 4*(t-23)\n\n      freeway8: (-39,-50,right,3) ->\n          left_end = -50 + 3*(t-23)\n          right_end = -39 + 3*(t-23)\n\n   Then for a given (t,y), if y in [1,8], we check if for any car on freeway y, 0 is in [left_end, right_end].\n\n   Note: the car spans are continuous intervals, so 0 is in [left_end, right_end] if left_end <= 0 <= right_end.\n\n   We'll do BFS:\n\n      Let's use a queue: each element (t, y, actions, path)\n      visited: we can use a dictionary or array indexed by t and y. Since t might go up, we can use a set: (t,y)\n\n      Start: (23, 2, 0, [])\n\n      while queue not empty:\n\n          pop (t, y, actions, path)\n\n          if y == 9: \n               we found a solution: actions_count = actions, and the path has the actions taken from turn23 to turn (23+actions-1) = t-1? \n               Because we are at state (t,y) which is the result after actions taken from turn23 to turn t-1.\n\n               The actions in the path are for turns: 23, 24, ..., t-1.\n\n               The number of actions = actions = t - 23.\n\n               So we output the path.\n\n          If we have not visited (t,y) and if is_safe(t,y) is True (i.e., at turn t, at freeway y if applicable, no collision), then mark visited and expand.\n\n          But note: we must check is_safe at the current state (t,y) before we take any action.\n\n          Then for each action in ['U','D','S']:\n\n               compute next_y = \n                   if 'U': min(9, y+1)\n                   if 'D': max(0, y-1)\n                   if 'S': y\n\n               next_t = t+1\n               next_actions = actions+1\n               next_path = path + [action]\n\n               And then we will check at (next_t, next_y) for collision when we pop it? But at expansion we only check the current state.\n\n          So we push (next_t, next_y, next_actions, next_path) into the queue.\n\n      We must check the current state (t,y) for safety before expansion.\n\n   But note: the start state (23,2): we must check it.\n\n   We are at turn23, y=2 -> freeway2, which we computed earlier as safe.\n\n   Then we expand to next states.\n\n   We hope to find a path.\n\n   Since we want the minimal actions, and BFS by t will find the path with minimal turns (hence minimal actions), we stop at the first time we reach y=9.\n\n   But note: it is possible that we reach y=9 at a later turn with the same number of actions? No, because each action increases t by 1, and the number of actions is t-23. So the first time we reach y=9 in terms of t gives the minimal actions.\n\n   However, we might reach y=9 at the same t by different paths, but we want the minimal actions, which is fixed by t.\n\n   We can break when we find any state with y=9.\n\n   We start at t=23, and then t increases, so we will find the smallest t (hence smallest actions = t-23) for which y=9 is reached.\n\n   But note: we might reach y=9 at t=23+7=30 with 7 actions, but maybe we have to wait and it takes more actions.\n\n   We'll code accordingly.\n\n   We'll set a bound on t, say up to 23+50.\n\n   We'll simulate.\n\n   Let's hope we find a path quickly.\n\n   We'll implement is_safe(t, y):\n\n        if y==0 or y==9: return True\n\n        cars = []\n        if y==1: \n            cars = [ (96,49,'right',48) ]\n        if y==2:\n            cars = [ (-36,-47,'right',12), (36,25,'right',12) ]\n        if y==3:\n            cars = [ (-36,-47,'right',12), (36,25,'right',12) ]   # same as freeway2\n        if y==4:\n            cars = [ (-60,-25,'left',36) ]\n        if y==5:\n            cars = [ (-60,-25,'left',36) ]\n        if y==6:\n            cars = [ (-30,-41,'right',6) ]\n        if y==7:\n            cars = [ (60,49,'right',4), (12,1,'right',4) ]\n        if y==8:\n            cars = [ (-39,-50,'right',3) ]\n\n        for car in cars:\n            head, tail, dir, speed = car\n            dt = t - 23\n            if dir == 'left':\n                left_end = head - speed * dt\n                right_end = tail - speed * dt\n            else: # 'right'\n                left_end = tail + speed * dt\n                right_end = head + speed * dt\n\n            # Now, we have the interval [left_end, right_end] (and we know left_end<=right_end)\n            if left_end <= 0 <= right_end:\n                return False   # collision\n\n        return True\n\n   Now, BFS:\n\n      from collections import deque\n      queue = deque()\n      # (t, y, actions, path) but we don't need to store the whole path in the queue to save memory, we can store parent pointers.\n\n      Alternatively, we can store (t, y, path) and then when we find y=9, output the path.\n\n      But to save memory, we can store:\n\n          Let's use a visited set for (t,y) to avoid duplicates.\n\n          We'll store for each (t,y) the parent (t_prev, y_prev) and the action taken from (t_prev, y_prev) to get to (t,y).\n\n      Steps:\n\n          visited = set()\n          parent = dict()  # key: (t,y), value: (parent_t, parent_y, action)\n          dist = dict()   # or we don't need if we do BFS by t\n\n          start: (23,2)\n          visited.add((23,2))\n          parent[(23,2)] = None\n          queue.append((23,2))\n\n          while queue:\n              (t,y) = queue.popleft()\n\n              if y == 9:\n                  break\n\n              # Check safety at (t,y): if not safe, then skip\n              if not is_safe(t,y):\n                  continue\n\n              for action in ['U','D','S']:\n                  if action == 'U':\n                      new_y = y+1\n                      if new_y > 9: new_y = 9\n                  elif action == 'D':\n                      new_y = y-1\n                      if new_y < 0: new_y = 0\n                  else: # 'S'\n                      new_y = y\n\n                  new_t = t+1\n\n                  # If we have not visited (new_t, new_y) and if new_t is within bound (say up to 23+50), and if we haven't visited it, then push.\n                  if new_t > 23+50: \n                      continue\n\n                  if (new_t, new_y) in visited:\n                      continue\n\n                  # We don't check safety at (new_t, new_y) now, we will check when we pop it.\n                  visited.add((new_t, new_y))\n                  parent[(new_t, new_y)] = (t, y, action)   # from (t,y) we took 'action' to get to (new_t, new_y)\n                  queue.append((new_t, new_y))\n\n          Then if we broke because of y==9, then we reconstruct the path backwards.\n\n          But note: we want the actions from turn23 to turn t-1 (which led to (t,9)).\n\n          The last action was taken at turn t-1 from state (t-1, y_prev) to (t,9).\n\n          How to reconstruct:\n\n             We have the state (t,9). \n             We get its parent: (t-1, y_prev, action_last)\n             Then the action at turn t-1 is action_last.\n             Then we go to (t-1, y_prev), and get its parent: (t-2, y_prev2, action_{t-2]), and so on until we reach (23,2).\n\n          Then the actions are in reverse order.\n\n          We then output from turn23 to turn t-1.\n\n          The number of actions = t - 23.\n\n          We want to minimize t-23.\n\n          Since BFS by increasing t, the first time we hit y=9 we have the minimal t.\n\n   However, we might have multiple paths with the same t? But we break at the first time we reach y=9.\n\n   Let's hope there is a path.\n\n   We'll run the BFS.\n\n   But note: the grid is small (10 states for y) and t up to 50, so 27*10=270 states? That's fine.\n\n   We'll code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the is_safe function: for a given (t,y) we compute the car spans.\n\n   Let's test is_safe for a few turns.\n\n   Example: freeway2 at turn23: \n        car1: left_end = -47 + 12*0 = -47, right_end=-36 -> 0 not in [-47,-36] -> safe.\n        car2: left_end=25, right_end=36 -> 0 not in [25,36] -> safe.\n\n   freeway2 at turn24: \n        dt=1\n        car1: [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35, -24] -> 0 not in this interval.\n        car2: [25+12,36+12] = [37,48] -> 0 not in.\n\n   freeway2 at turn25: \n        car1: [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23, -12] -> 0 not in.\n        car2: [25+24,36+24] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\n   freeway2 at turn26: \n        car1: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0] -> 0 is in [-11,0] -> so at turn26, freeway2 is unsafe.\n\n   So at turn26, if we are on freeway2, we collide.\n\n   We start at turn23 at y=2. We can try to move up as fast as possible.\n\n   Actions: \n        turn23: U -> y=3 at turn24.\n        turn24: U -> y=4 at turn25.\n        turn25: U -> y=5 at turn26.\n        turn26: we are at (26,5) -> freeway5: cars: [ (-60,-25,'left',36) ] -> at turn26, dt=3, so left_end = -60 - 36*3 = -60-108 = -168, right_end = -25-108 = -133. 0 not in [-168,-133] -> safe.\n        turn26: we can then go U: to y=6 at turn27.\n\n        turn27: (27,6) -> freeway6: car: (-30,-41,right,6): at turn27, dt=4, left_end=-41+6*4 = -41+24 = -17, right_end=-30+24=-6 -> 0 in [-17,-6]? -17<=0<=-6 -> 0 is in the interval. So collision.\n\n   So at turn27, if we are at y=6, we collide.\n\n   So that path fails.\n\n   We might need to wait at some point.\n\n   Alternative: at turn25, we are at y=5 (freeway5). At turn25, dt=2: freeway5: left_end=-60-36*2=-60-72=-132, right_end=-25-72=-97 -> safe.\n        But at turn25, we could also choose to not go up: we could stay or go down.\n\n   For example, at turn25: y=5, we could choose S: then at turn26: still at y=5.\n\n        At turn26: freeway5: left_end=-60-36*3=-168, right_end=-25-108=-133 -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn26: we can go U to y=6 at turn27.\n\n        At turn27: freeway6: car: left_end=-41+6*4=-41+24=-17, right_end=-30+24=-6 -> unsafe.\n\n        Or at turn26: we go U to y=6 at turn27: unsafe.\n\n        Or we could go down to y=4 at turn27.\n\n        At turn27: freeway4: cars: [ (-60,-25,'left',36) ] -> dt=4, left_end=-60-144=-204, right_end=-25-144=-169 -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn27: we are at y=4, and then we can go up later.\n\n   But we need to eventually go to 9.\n\n   We might need to wait at freeway5 for several turns.\n\n   Let's see when freeway6 becomes safe:\n\n        freeway6: car: ( -30, -41, right, 6)\n        at turn t: left_end = -41 + 6*(t-23), right_end = -30+6*(t-23)\n\n        We require that 0 is NOT in [left_end, right_end] = [-41+6*(t-23), -30+6*(t-23)]\n\n        That means: either 0 < left_end or 0 > right_end.\n\n        Case 1: 0 < left_end  => 0 < -41+6*dt => 6*dt > 41 => dt >= 7 (since 6*6=36<41, 6*7=42>41) -> for dt>=7, left_end = -41+6*7 = 1, so 0<1 -> then 0 is not in the interval.\n\n        Case 2: 0 > right_end => 0 > -30+6*dt => 6*dt < 30 => dt<5.\n\n        So for dt<5 or dt>=7, freeway6 is safe.\n\n        At turn23: dt=0 -> safe (dt<5)\n        turn24: dt=1: safe\n        turn25: dt=2: safe\n        turn26: dt=3: safe\n        turn27: dt=4: safe? \n             left_end = -41+24 = -17, right_end=-30+24=-6 -> 0 in [-17,-6] -> unsafe.\n        turn28: dt=5: \n             left_end = -41+30 = -11, right_end=-30+30=0 -> 0 is included (right_end=0) -> unsafe.\n        turn29: dt=6: \n             left_end = -41+36 = -5, right_end=-30+36=6 -> 0 in [-5,6] -> unsafe.\n        turn30: dt=7: \n             left_end = -41+42=1, right_end=-30+42=12 -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        So freeway6 is safe for turns: \n            t in [23,26] (dt0 to dt3) and then from t=30 (dt=7) onwards.\n\n        Therefore, we can only be on freeway6 at turns 23 to 26 and then from 30 onwards.\n\n   Similarly, we should check other freeways.\n\n   We might need to wait at freeway5 until turn30 to then go to freeway6.\n\n   How about:\n\n        turn23: start at 2 -> safe.\n        a23: U -> turn24:3\n        a24: U -> turn25:4\n        a25: U -> turn26:5\n        Now at turn26: y=5, safe.\n        Then we need to wait at y=5 for 4 turns? until turn30?\n\n        Actions at turn26,27,28,29: S, S, S, S -> then at turn30: still at y=5.\n        Then at turn30: we are at y=5, safe? freeway5: \n             car: left_end = -60 - 36*(30-23) = -60 - 36*7 = -60-252 = -312, right_end = -25 - 252 = -277 -> safe.\n        Then we can go up:\n             a30: U -> turn31:6 -> freeway6: at turn31, dt=31-23=8 -> left_end=-41+6*8=-41+48=7, right_end=-30+48=18 -> safe.\n        a31: U -> turn32:7 -> freeway7: \n             cars: \n                 car1: (60,49,right,4): dt=9 -> left_end=49+4*9=49+36=85, right_end=60+36=96 -> safe? 0 not in [85,96]\n                 car2: (12,1,right,4): left_end=1+36=37, right_end=12+36=48 -> safe.\n        a32: U -> turn33:8 -> freeway8: \n             car: (-39,-50,right,3): dt=10 -> left_end=-50+3*10=-20, right_end=-39+30=-9 -> unsafe! 0 in [-20,-9]? -20<=0<=-9 -> no, 0 is not in [ -20, -9] because -9<0. \n             Actually, 0 is not in [-20,-9] because the interval is from -20 to -9, and 0 is greater than -9.\n\n             So safe.\n\n        a33: U -> turn34:9 -> done.\n\n        Total actions: from turn23 to turn33: 11 actions.\n\n        But is there a shorter path?\n\n   Alternatively, we might go from 5 to 6 earlier? But freeway6 is unsafe from turn27 to 29.\n\n   Or we could go from 5 to 4 to avoid waiting? \n\n        At turn26: we are at y=5. Instead of waiting, we go down to y=4 at turn27.\n        At turn27: freeway4: \n             car: left_end = -60 - 36*(27-23) = -60-36*4 = -60-144 = -204, right_end=-25-144=-169 -> safe.\n        Then at turn27: we can wait at y=4? \n        But we need to go to 9 eventually.\n\n        Or at turn27: go down to y=3? \n        freeway3 at turn27: \n             cars: [ (-36,-47,right,12), (36,25,right,12) ]\n             dt=4:\n                 car1: left_end=-47+12*4 = -47+48=1, right_end=-36+48=12 -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n                 car2: left_end=25+48=73, right_end=36+48=84 -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn27: we are at y=3, safe.\n\n        Then we can wait until turn30 to then go up.\n\n        But then we have to go up from 3 to 9, which is 6 steps, and we are at turn27, so we would reach 9 at turn27+6=33, same as before.\n\n        Or we could go up earlier if we avoid freeway6 until turn30.\n\n   Actually, the minimal actions might be 11.\n\n   But let's see if we can do better.\n\n   We start at 2. We need to go up 7 steps. If we go up continuously, we would be at:\n\n        turn23:2\n        turn24:3\n        turn25:4\n        turn26:5\n        turn27:6 -> unsafe (freeway6 at turn27: unsafe as above)\n        So we cannot go to 6 at turn27.\n\n   So we must wait at 5 for 4 turns? from turn26 to turn30? That's 4 waits.\n\n   Then at turn30: we are at 5, then we go up: \n        turn30:5 -> a30:U-> turn31:6 (safe at freeway6, as above)\n        turn31:6 -> a31:U-> turn32:7 (freeway7: safe as above)\n        turn32:7 -> a32:U-> turn33:8 (freeway8: safe as above)\n        turn33:8 -> a33:U-> turn34:9.\n\n   So actions: 4 (from 2 to 5) + 4 (wait) + 4 (from 5 to 9) = 12 actions.\n\n   But wait, we start at turn23: \n        actions: \n          23: U (to3)\n          24: U (to4)\n          25: U (to5)\n          26: S (wait at5)\n          27: S (wait at5)\n          28: S (wait at5)\n          29: S (wait at5)\n          30: U (to6)\n          31: U (to7)\n          32: U (to8)\n          33: U (to9)\n\n        So 11 actions: turns23 to 33.\n\n   And then at turn34: we are at 9.\n\n   But the last action is at turn33, so the sequence has 11 actions.\n\n   And we are at 9 at turn34.\n\n   But the problem requires that at turn23+H-1=23+11-1=33, we are at 9? \n        In our simulation, at turn33, we are at 8, and then we take U to go to 9 at turn34.\n\n   So we are not at 9 at turn33.\n\n   This goes back to the confusion.\n\n   Given the problem requires y_{t1+H-1}=9, we must be at 9 at turn33.\n\n   So in our simulation, we are at 9 at turn34, which would be after 11 actions, but then the turn is 34 = 23+11.\n\n   So to be at 9 at turn33, we would need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn33.\n\n   That means we must have arrived at turn33 from turn32.\n\n   So we must have been at 8 at turn32 and taken U at turn32 to get to 9 at turn33.\n\n   So the last action is at turn32, and the total actions is 10? \n\n   How to get to 8 at turn32:\n\n        We need to be at 8 at turn32.\n\n        How many steps from 2 to 8: 6 steps.\n\n        With 6 actions of U, we would be at 8 at turn23+6 = turn29.\n\n        But then we have to avoid the freeways.\n\n        Let's try:\n\n          23: start at2, safe.\n          a23: U ->24:3 (freeway3: safe? at24, freeway3: \n               cars: \n                 car1: left_end=-47+12*(1)= -35, right_end=-36+12=-24 -> safe.\n                 car2: left_end=25+12=37, right_end=36+12=48 -> safe.\n          a24: U->25:4 (freeway4: at25: car: left_end=-60-36*2=-132, right_end=-25-72=-97 -> safe.\n          a25: U->26:5 (freeway5: at26: car: left_end=-60-36*3=-168, right_end=-25-108=-133 -> safe.\n          a26: U->27:6 (freeway6: at27: unsafe) -> fail.\n\n        So we cannot go to 6 at27.\n\n        We have to wait at5 for 4 turns? then:\n          a23:U->24:3\n          a24:U->25:4\n          a25:U->26:5\n          a26:S->27:5 (freeway5: safe at27? dt=4: left_end=-60-144=-204, right_end=-25-144=-169 -> safe.\n          a27:S->28:5 (freeway5: dt=5: left_end=-60-180=-240, right_end=-25-180=-205 -> safe.\n          a28:S->29:5 (freeway5: dt=6: left_end=-60-216=-276, right_end=-25-216=-241 -> safe.\n          a29:S->30:5 (freeway5: dt=7: safe.\n          a30:U->31:6 (freeway6: safe at31: dt=8, as above)\n          a31:U->32:7 (freeway7: safe at32: \n               car1: [49+4*(32-23)=49+36=85, 60+36=96] -> safe.\n               car2: [1+36=37,12+36=48] -> safe.\n          a32:U->33:8 (freeway8: at33: dt=10: \n               car: left_end=-50+3*10=-20, right_end=-39+30=-9 -> 0 not in [-20,-9] (since -9<0) -> safe.\n\n          Then at turn33, we are at 8. We want to be at 9 at turn33? We are not.\n\n          We then need to take an action at turn33: U->34:9.\n\n          So we are at 9 at turn34.\n\n        To be at 9 at turn33, we would have to be at 8 at turn32 and then take U at turn32 to get to 9 at turn33.\n\n        So we need to be at 8 at turn32.\n\n        From the above, we are at 7 at turn31, and then U at turn31: to8 at turn32.\n\n        So the path:\n\n          23:2 ->24:3 (U)\n          24:3 ->25:4 (U)\n          25:4 ->26:5 (U)\n          26:5 ->27:5 (S)\n          27:5 ->28:5 (S)\n          28:5 ->29:5 (S)\n          29:5 ->30:5 (S)\n          30:5 ->31:6 (U)\n          31:6 ->32:7 (U)\n          32:7 ->33:8 (U)  [ now at turn33, we are at 8]\n\n        Then at turn33: we take U to go to 9 at turn34.\n\n        So to be at 9 at turn33, we would need to be at 8 at turn32 and then take U at turn32 to get to 9 at turn33? \n           a32:U (at turn32) -> turn33:9.\n\n        So then the last action is at turn32, and we are at 9 at turn33.\n\n        Therefore, the actions are from turn23 to turn32: 10 actions.\n\n        And we are at 9 at turn33 = 23+10-1 = 23+9? \n             turn23: action0\n             turn24: action1\n             ...\n             turn32: action9 (the 10th action) \n             then at turn33: we are at 9.\n\n        So the condition is met: at turn23+10-1 = turn32+? \n             t1+H-1 = 23+10-1 = 32? \n        But we are at 9 at turn33, not turn32.\n\n        This is the confusion.\n\n        The problem says: after the sequence of actions (which are for turns t1 to t1+H-1), we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\n        In our sequence, the actions are for turns23 to 32 (H=10 actions), and then at turn33 ( which is turn23+10) we are at 9.\n\n        But the problem requires at turn23+H-1 = 23+10-1 = 32, we are at 9.\n\n        So it does not match.\n\n        How can we be at 9 at turn32?\n\n        We must be at 8 at turn31 and then take U at turn31 to get to 9 at turn32.\n\n        So we need to be at 8 at turn31.\n\n        Let's try to see if we can get to 8 at turn31:\n\n          23:2\n          24:3 (U)\n          25:4 (U)\n          26:5 (U)\n          27:5 (S) [wait at5]\n          28:5 (S)\n          29:5 (S)\n          30:5 (S)  [ at turn30: still at5]\n          31: we need to be at8 -> that's 3 steps in one action? -> impossible.\n\n        We need to leave freeway5 earlier.\n\n        Alternatively, we could at turn26 go down to4, then at turn27 go down to3, then at turn28 go down to2? \n        then at turn28: freeway2: at dt=5: \n             car1: left_end=-47+12*5 = -47+60=13, right_end=-36+60=24 -> safe.\n             car2: left_end=25+60=85, right_end=36+60=96 -> safe.\n        turn29: from2 to3 (U) -> freeway3 at turn29: \n             car1: left_end=-47+12*6 = -47+72=25, right_end=-36+72=36 -> safe (0 not in)\n             car2: 25+72=97, 36+72=108 -> safe.\n        turn30: from3 to4 (U) -> freeway4: at30, dt=7: left_end=-60-36*7=-312, right_end=-25-252=-277 -> safe.\n        turn31: from4 to5 (U) -> freeway5: safe.\n        turn32: from5 to6 (U) -> freeway6: at32, dt=9: \n             left_end=-41+6*9 = -41+54=13, right_end=-30+54=24 -> safe.\n        turn33: from6 to7 (U) -> freeway7: at33, dt=10:\n             car1: 49+4*10=89, 60+40=100 -> safe.\n             car2: 1+40=41, 12+40=52 -> safe.\n        turn34: from7 to8 (U) -> freeway8: at34, dt=11: \n             left_end=-50+3*11=-50+33=-17, right_end=-39+33=-6 -> unsafe? 0 in [-17,-6] -> no, because -6<0.\n\n             Actually, 0 is not in [-17,-6] because the interval is from -17 to -6, and 0 is greater than -6.\n\n             so safe.\n        turn35: from8 to9 (U) -> done.\n\n        Then at turn35, we are at9.\n\n        Actions from turn23 to turn34: 12 actions.\n\n        Then at turn35 = 23+12, we are at9.\n\n        To be at9 at turn34 = 23+12-1? -> turn34+1? not matching.\n\n        Given the confusion, I think the problem intended: we want to be at (0,9) at the turn immediately after the last action, i.e., at turn23+H.\n\n        And the minimal number of turns H is the number of actions.\n\n        In the example above, with 11 actions we are at9 at turn34 = 23+11.\n\n        So H=11.\n\n        Then the answer would be the 11 actions.\n\n        We'll output for turns23 to turn33.\n\n        Actions: \n          turn23: U\n          turn24: U\n          turn25: U\n          turn26: S\n          turn27: S\n          turn28: S\n          turn29: S\n          turn30: U\n          turn31: U\n          turn32: U\n          turn33: U\n\n        So the sequence.\n\n        We'll run the BFS to find the path with minimal actions (H) such that at turn23+H, we are at9.\n\n        Then the condition is: after H actions, at turn23+H, y=9.\n\n        And then the answer format: \n             Turn 23: a23\n             ...\n             Turn 23+H-1: a_{23+H-1}\n\n        For this example, H=11, so we output actions for turns23 to 23+10=33.\n\n        But turn33: a33 = U.\n\n        So the last action is at turn33.\n\n        We are at9 at turn34.\n\n        But the problem's last turn in the sequence is turn23+H-1 = 23+11-1=33, which is correct.\n\n        And then the position at turn33+1=34 is 9, but the problem doesn't require to output that.\n\n        So we output the 11 actions.\n\n        We hope the BFS finds this path.\n\n        We'll implement the BFS that we described earlier, where we are at (t,y) and we take actions to (t+1,y') and we want to reach (t,9) for any t.\n\n        But note: in the B, we break when we find a state (t,9) for any t.\n\n        That state (t,9) means we are at the beginning of turn t at position 9. Then we don't need to take any action at turn t.\n\n        The number of actions taken to get to (t,9) is the number of actions from turn23 to turn t-1, i.e., actions = t - 23.\n\n        And the actions in the path are for turns: 23,24,...,t-1.\n\n        The last action is at turn t-1.\n\n        So the sequence has actions from turn23 to turn t-1, which is (t-23) actions.\n\n        We then output actions for turn23 to turn t-1.\n\n        This matches the requirement: at turn t1+H-1 = 23 + (t-23) - 1 = t-1, we take the last action, and then at turn t, we are at9.\n\n        So condition: at turn23+H-1 (which is turn t-1) we take the last action, and then at the next turn we are at9.\n\n        But the problem says: at turn23+H-1, we are at (0,9). This is not true in our simulation, because at turn23+H-1 we are at the state before the action, and then after the action at that turn, we are at9 at the next turn.\n\n        However, the problem might mean the position after the last action is (0,9) at the next turn.\n\n        Given the answer format only asks for the actions, we output the actions.\n\n        We'll assume that.\n\n        So we do the BFS until we find a state (t,9) for any t.\n\n        Then we output the actions that led to it.\n\n        We hope to find the path with minimal actions = t-23.\n\n        We'll run the BFS now.\n\n   Let's hope it finds the path we described.\n\n   Given the complexity, and the fact that we have to code, we'll do a simple BFS with a bound on t.\n\n   We'll set a bound, say up to t=23+20.\n\n   We'll do it in code.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do it by hand for this case.\n\n   We have to reach 9 in minimal actions, and we know one path with 11 actions.\n\n   But is there a path with 10 actions? \n        We need to be at9 at turn23+10 = turn33.\n        We need to be at a state (33,9).\n\n        How to get to (33,9): \n            We must have been at (32,8) or (32,9) or (32,10) and then take action: \n                if at8: U to9\n                if at9: S to9\n                if at10: D to9\n\n            But at turn32, if at8: freeway8 must be safe.\n\n            freeway8 at turn32: dt=9: \n                left_end = -50+3*9 = -50+27 = -23, right_end=-39+27=-12 -> 0 not in? -> safe.\n\n            if at9: no freeway, safe.\n            if at10: not possible.\n\n        So we can be at8 or9 at turn32.\n\n        To be at8 or9 at turn32, we need to get there in 9 actions.\n\n        Let's see if we can get to8 at turn32 in 9 actions.\n\n        Steps: 2->8: 6 steps up, so 6 actions of U and 3 actions of wait or down.\n\n        For example: \n           2->3 (1U), 3->4 (1U), 4->5 (1U), then wait at5 for 3 times, then 5->6 (1U), 6->7 (1U), 7->8 (1U) -> total actions: 6U +3S = 9 actions.\n\n        But we have to check the freeways.\n\n        turn23:2 (safe)\n        a23:U->24:3 (freeway3: safe at24: as before)\n        a24:U->25:4 (freeway4: safe)\n        a25:U->26:5 (freeway5: safe)\n        a26:S->27:5 (freeway5: safe)\n        a27:S->28:5 (freeway5: safe)\n        a28:S->29:5 (freeway5: safe)\n        a29:U->30:6 (freeway6: at30, dt=7: safe? -> left_end=-41+42=1, right_end=-30+42=12 -> safe)\n        a30:U->31:7 (freeway7: at31, dt=8: \n             car1: 49+4*8=49+32=81, 60+32=92 -> safe\n             car2: 1+32=33, 12+32=44 -> safe)\n        a31:U->32:8 (freeway8: at32, dt=9: left_end=-50+27=-23, right_end=-39+27=-12 -> safe)\n\n        Then at turn32, we are at8.\n        Then we need to be at9 at turn33: so one more action: a32:U->33:9.\n\n        But then we are at9 at turn33, which is the state (33,9).\n\n        Then the number of actions to get to (33,9) is 10 actions (from a23 to a32).\n\n        This is better than 11.\n\n        Actions (10 actions):\n          23: U\n          24: U\n          25: U\n          26: S\n          27: S\n          28: S\n          29: U  (from5 to6)\n          30: U  (6->7)\n          31: U  (7->8)\n          32: U  (8->9)\n\n        But wait, at turn32: we are at state (32,8) and then we take U to go to (33,9).\n\n        So the state (33,9) is reached by 10 actions.\n\n        Therefore, we output the 10 actions for turns23 to 32.\n\n        And the last action (at32) is 'U'.\n\n        This is shorter than the 11 we found earlier.\n\n        So we must use this.\n\n        Let's verify freeway6 at turn30: dt=7: safe ( as above)\n        freeway7 at turn31: safe.\n        freeway8 at turn32: safe.\n\n        And at turn29: we are at5: freeway5 at29: dt=6: left_end=-60-36*6 = -60-216 = -276, right_end=-25-216=-241 -> safe.\n\n        So the path is valid.\n\n        Therefore, minimal actions is 10.\n\n   We'll output the 10 actions.\n\n   The answer:\n\n        Turn 23: U\n        Turn 24: U\n        Turn 25: U\n        Turn 26: S\n        Turn 27: S\n        Turn 28: S\n        Turn 29: U\n        Turn 30: U\n        Turn 31: U\n        Turn 32: U\n\n   But wait, from 5 at turn29, we go U to6 at turn30. Then U to7 at31, U to8 at32, U to9 at33.\n\n   So the action at32 is U, and then at turn33 we are at9.\n\n   But the state (33,9) is reached, and the actions are for turns23 to32.\n\n   So the sequence is correct.\n\n   Therefore, we have a path with 10 actions.\n\n   We should code the BFS to find this path.\n\n   Given the time, and since the problem asks for the minimal actions, and we found one with 10, we output it.\n\n   But note: the problem might have a shorter path? \n        We need 7 net upward moves, and we took 6 upward moves from 2 to8, and then one more to9, total upward moves: 7, and then 3 waits, so 10 actions.\n\n        Is there a path with 9 actions? \n            7 upward moves and 2 waits or downs? \n            from 2 to9: 7 up, so if we do 7 ups and 2 extra actions, we would be at9 in 9 actions only if we can avoid collisions by waiting less.\n\n        But we have to wait at5 for at least 3 turns? from turn26 to29: because freeway6 is unsafe from turn27 to29.\n\n        We are at5 at turn26. We leave at turn29 (by U) to6 at turn30.\n\n        So we wait at5 for turns26,27,28 -> 3 turns.\n\n        Therefore, minimal actions might be 7+3 = 10.\n\n        So we output the 10 actions as above.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is:\n\n        Turn 23: U\n        Turn 24: U\n        Turn 25: U\n        Turn 26: S\n        Turn 27: S\n        Turn 28: S\n        Turn 29: U\n        Turn 30: U\n        Turn 31: U\n        Turn 32: U\n\n   But note: at turn29 we are at5 and go U to6 at turn30. This is safe because freeway6 at turn30 (dt=7) is safe.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   So we box the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) is 10. The sequence of actions starting from turn 23 is as follows:\n\n- At turn 23, move up (U) to position \\((0, 3)\\).\n- At turn 24, move up (U) to position \\((0, 4)\\).\n- At turn 25, move up (U) to position \\((0, 5)\\).\n- At turn 26, stay (S) to remain at \\((0, 5)\\) to avoid collision on freeway 6 at turn 27.\n- At turn 27, stay (S) to remain at \\((0, 5)\\) to avoid collision on freeway 6 at turn 28.\n- At turn 28, stay (S) to remain at \\((0, 5)\\) to avoid collision on freeway 6 at turn 29.\n- At turn 29, move up (U) to position \\((0, 6)\\), which is safe on freeway 6 at turn 30 (since the car has moved past x=0).\n- At turn 30, move up (U) to position \\((0, 7)\\), safe on freeway 7.\n- At turn 31, move up (U) to position \\((0, 8)\\), safe on freeway 8.\n- At turn 32, move up (U) to position \\((0, 9)\\), reaching the goal.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8, as verified for each turn. The actions are chosen to wait at y=5 for three turns (turns 26, 27, 28) to avoid the unsafe period for freeway 6 (turns 27 to 29), then proceed upward safely.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 23: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 24: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 25: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 26: S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 27: S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 28: S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 29: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 30: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 31: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 32: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 27, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8 (which correspond to y=1 to y=8).\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the car on that freeway at that turn has 0 in its span (meaning the car covers the x=0 position at turn T).\n\nThe player's vertical movement: \n  U: y increases by 1 (unless at 9, then cannot go above 9)\n  D: y decreases by 1 (unless at 0, then cannot go below 0)\n  S: stay at same y.\n\nNote: When moving from y to y+1 (or y-1) at turn T, the player is considered on the new freeway only at the next turn. Specifically:\n  - At turn T, the player is at y_T.\n  - Then we choose an action that will lead to y_{T+1} = y_T, y_T+1, or y_T-1 (clamped to [0,9]).\n  - The collision check at turn T is only for the freeway y_T. When we move, at turn T we are still on the old freeway, and at turn T+1 we are on the new freeway.\n\nTherefore, if we are at y_T and we move up (to y_T+1) at turn T, then at turn T we are on freeway y_T (so we must avoid collision with cars on freeway y_T at turn T). Then at turn T+1, we are on freeway y_T+1 (so we must avoid collision with cars on freeway y_T+1 at turn T+1).\n\nThe goal is to have the player at (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1 (meaning we start at t1 and take H-1 actions? Actually, the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so we start at t1 (which is the current turn) and we take H actions? Let me clarify:\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and we want to reach at turn t1 + H - 1? Actually, note:\n\n- At turn t1 (current turn, t=0 in the sequence index): we are at (0,0). Then we choose an action a_{t1} (which is the first action) that will determine y_{t1+1}.\n- Then at turn t1+1, we choose a_{t1+1}, and so on until turn t1+H-1 (which is the last turn of the sequence) we are at (0,9).\n\nSo the total number of turns from the start (t1) to the end (t1+H-1) is H turns? Actually, we take H actions (from t=0 to t=H-1) and then we have H state transitions? But note that we start at turn t1 and after one action we are at turn t1+1. So the state at turn t1 (initial) is given, then we apply H actions to get to turn t1+H. However, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me re-read: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nActually, the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nSo:\n- We start at turn t1 (index t=0 in the sequence) with position (0,0).\n- We take action a_{t1} (which is the first action) and then at turn t1+1 we have a new state.\n- We take H-1 actions? Because the sequence has H actions: from t=0 to t=H-1. Then the last state is at turn t1+H-1? Actually, the state after the last action (the H-th action) is at turn t1+H. But the problem says that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nLet me clarify the timeline:\n\nTurn t1: initial state: y_{t1} = 0.\nThen we take action a_{t1} -> state at turn t1+1: y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta y_{t1}.\nThen we take action a_{t1+1} -> state at turn t1+2: y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Delta y_{t1+1}.\n...\nAfter the last action (the H-th action, which is a_{t1+H-1}), we have the state at turn t1+H: y_{t1+H} = ... \n\nBut the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). So we are requiring that at the turn before the last action? That doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, note: the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1, meaning the actions taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the state at turn t1+H (after H actions) would be the result of the last action. But the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nThis implies that we are taking actions for H-1 steps? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nBut note: \n- At turn t1 (when we take the first action) we are at y_{t1}=0. Then we take an action a_{t1} and move to turn t1+1 with y_{t1+1}.\n- We take the last action of the sequence at turn t1+H-1 (which is the H-th action? because t goes from 0 to H-1, so there are H actions). Then the state at turn t1+H is the result of that last action. But the problem says we require the state at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). \n\nSo that means we are not using the last action to get to 9? That seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, let me count the turns:\n\n- The initial state is at turn t1 (which is 27). We want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo we are starting at turn 27 and we want to be at (0,9) at turn 27 + (H-1). Therefore, the total number of turns from the start (including the start) is (H-1) - 27 + 1? Actually, the time from turn 27 to turn 27+H-1 is H-1 steps? \n\nBut note: we have to take actions at each turn from 27 to 27+H-2? Because if we take H actions (at turns 27, 28, ..., 27+H-1) then the state at turn 27+H is the result of the last action. However, the problem says we are to be at (0,9) at turn 27+H-1.\n\nThis suggests that the last action is taken at turn 27+H-1 and then we are at 9 at the same turn? But that doesn't match because the action taken at turn 27+H-1 affects the state at turn 27+H.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nBut the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state after the actions taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? Because:\n\n- At turn t1: we are at initial state. Then we take action a_{t1} to get to state at turn t1+1.\n- At turn t1+1: we are at state after the first action. Then take a_{t1+1} to get to state at turn t1+2.\n- ...\n- At turn t1+H-2: we take action a_{t1+H-2} to get to state at turn t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of actions has H-1 actions? Because t runs from 0 to H-1, which is H actions? That would lead to state at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the requirement is state at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). Therefore, we must have the state at turn t1+H-1 being (0,9) without having taken an action at turn t1+H-1? That is, we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2 (total H-1 actions) and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nSo the sequence of actions is for t=0 to H-2? But the problem says t=0 to H-1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number H is the total number of turns from the start (turn t1) to the goal (turn t1+H-1) is H turns? But we take H-1 actions? \n\nI think the problem means that we take H actions (so the sequence has H actions) and then the state at the turn after the last action (turn t1+H) is the result. But then the requirement is for turn t1+H-1? That doesn't match.\n\nLooking back: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we are at turn t1+H-1. \n\nThis implies that we are taking actions for H turns? Actually, the number of actions is H (from t=0 to t=H-1). Then the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then the state at turn t1+H is the result of that action. But the problem says we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThat would mean that at the turn we are taking the last action, we are already at (0,9). But then why take an action? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state we are in when we take the action at turn t1+H-1? But then the action we take at that turn might change the state to turn t1+H, but we are not requiring anything for turn t1+H.\n\nI think there is an off-by-one issue. Let me reinterpret: the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". This means that we must be at (0,9) at the moment we are about to take the action at turn t1+H-1? But then the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken and we move to turn t1+H, but we don't care about that state.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to output the actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1. And we require that at turn t1+H-1 (the turn at which we are taking the last action) the player is at (0,9). \n\nHowever, note that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, the player is at some state. Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} and then move to turn t1+H. But the requirement is that the player is at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 (before taking the action?).\n\nBut the problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if ... for any car on freeway y_T\". So the state at turn T is the state at the beginning of the turn? Or after the action? \n\nThe game dynamics: \n  Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t. \n  So at the beginning of turn t, the player is at y_t. Then we choose an action a_t, and then we update to y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nTherefore, at turn t, the player is at y_t. And we check for collision at turn t: if the player is on a freeway (y_t in [1,8]), then we check the car on that freeway at turn t.\n\nSo for the goal: we require that at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). And we are to take an action at that turn? But note that (0,9) is not a freeway (freeways are 1 to 8), so no collision check at (0,9). And also, we are allowed to be at (0,9) without being on a freeway.\n\nSo the plan is: we must be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1, but that action might move us away? But the problem doesn't require us to stay at 9, only that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nHowever, note that the goal is to reach (0,9), so we can stop at that turn? But the problem requires a sequence of actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1, meaning we take an action at turn t1+H-1. But if we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we can take an action that doesn't move (S) and then we stay at (0,9) for the next turn? But that is not required.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 and then we take an action (any action) and move to (0,9) if we choose S, or to (0,8) if we choose D, etc. But the problem only requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). So we can take an action that moves us away? That seems odd.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", meaning the minimal H such that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). So we are counting the turns from the initial turn (t1) to the turn when we first become at (0,9). And we have to output the actions until that turn.\n\nHowever, the sequence of actions includes the action at the turn when we are at (0,9)? But we don't need to do anything at that turn? Actually, we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action. But the goal is achieved at the beginning of that turn. So we can choose any action at that turn? But to avoid moving away, we can choose S.\n\nBut the minimal H is the number of turns from the start (turn t1) to the goal turn (t1+H-1). So the total number of turns that pass is H? (from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, which is H turns? Actually, from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1 inclusive is (t1+H-1 - t1 + 1) = H turns? But we are only taking actions at the first H-1 of them? \n\nI think the problem is defined as:\n\n- We are at turn t1 (27) at the start.\n- We take an action at every turn until we are at (0,9) at the beginning of a turn.\n- We want the minimal H such that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nBut then the number of actions we take is H-1? Because we take an action at turn t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2, and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9) and we take an action at that turn as well? \n\nThe problem says: the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. And then at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nBut note: the state at the beginning of turn t1 is given (0,0). Then we take an action at turn t1 to get to state at turn t1+1. Then we take an action at turn t1+1 to get to state at turn t1+2, and so on. After taking the action at turn t1+H-2, we get to state at turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1 to get to state at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the requirement is that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). So the state at turn t1+H-1 must be (0,9). How did we get there? By the actions taken at turns t1 to t1+H-2. Then at turn t1+H-1 we take an action (which may move us away, but we don't care as long as at the beginning of that turn we are at 9). However, the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, and then we are done? But the problem requires a sequence of H actions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal H is the number of turns that we are simulating, and we are required to output the actions for the entire sequence until the turn we are at 9. But then the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is taken while we are at (0,9). We can choose S to stay.\n\nSo the state at turn t1+H-1 is (0,9) and we take action S at that turn.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the minimal H such that there exists a sequence of H actions (the last one being at turn t1+H-1) and the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is (0,9).\n\nHow do we compute the state at the beginning of a turn? \n\nLet me denote:\n  t1 = 27.\n  We start at turn 27: y_27 = 0.\n\n  After action a_27: we get y_28 = y_27 + Delta y_27.\n\n  Then at turn 28: we are at y_28, and we check for collision? Yes, if y_28 is in [1,8] then we check the car on freeway y_28 at turn 28.\n\n  But note: the car positions are updated for each turn. The car update rule: for a car, at turn T, the span is computed based on the initial state at turn t1 and the speed.\n\nSpecifically, for a car on freeway i, at turn T (T>=t1), the span is:\n  If left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]  -> but wait, the initial at turn t1 is (h, tau) and then at turn T, it moves by s*(T-t1) to the left.\n  If right-moving: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nCollision at turn T if the player is on freeway i (i.e., y_T = i) and 0 is in the span of the car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNote: each freeway may have multiple cars. So we must avoid 0 being in any car's span on the freeway we are on at turn T.\n\nWe start at y=0 (which is not a freeway) at turn 27, so no collision at turn 27.\n\nWe need to get to y=9 (also not a freeway) at turn 27+H-1.\n\nThe minimal number of moves to go from 0 to 9 is 9 moves (if we always go up). But we have to avoid the freeways 1 to 8 at the turns when we are on them.\n\nSo we must simulate the movement and check for collisions at each turn when we are on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe are going to use BFS (breadth-first search) to find the minimal H. We start at (turn=27, y=0). We want to reach (turn=t, y=9) for some t (which will be 27+H-1) and minimize H (which is t - 27 + 1? because H-1 = t - 27? so H = t - 27 + 1).\n\nBut note: we are going to simulate state = (turn, y). The actions: U, D, S. But we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe have to check at each state (turn, y) if we are on a freeway (y from 1 to 8) then we must check that at this turn, the car (or cars) on that freeway do not cover 0.\n\nThe cars are defined for each freeway at the initial turn (27). And then we can compute the car's span at any turn T by:\n\n  For a car with initial (h, tau, d, s) at turn 27, then at turn T (>=27):\n    if d is 'left': \n        head = h - s*(T-27)\n        tail = tau - s*(T-27)\n        span = [head, tail]? But note: in the left-moving car, the initial span is [h, tau] and then moves left, so the head (which is the front) is at h and then becomes h - s*(T-27). But note: in the update rule for left-moving: \n          \"Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\"\n\n        However, if the car is moving left, then the head is the leftmost part? Actually, the problem says: for left-moving, the head is at h and tail at tau? and then the span is [h, tau] meaning from h to tau? But if the car is moving left, then the head (front) is at the left? \n\n        But note: the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So if h < tau? Or h>tau? \n\n        The example: freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48) -> wait, this is right-moving? \n\n        Actually, the table gives:\n\n        Freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48) -> direction is right, so it's right-moving.\n\n        For a right-moving car: the initial span is [tau, h]? Or [h, tau]? The problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\". But in the table, it is given as (head, tail) and then direction. \n\n        The table says: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\".\n\n        Then the update rule for right-moving: \n          \"Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\n        Why is it [tau, h]? Because the head is the front? So for a right-moving car, the head is at h (which is the front) and tail at tau (the rear). So the span from tail to head is [tau, h]. Then when moving right, the entire span moves right.\n\n        Similarly, for a left-moving car: the head is at h (the front) and tail at tau, and the span is from head to tail? But note: if the car is moving left, the head is the leftmost point? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1)=[h, tau]\" and then moves left.\n\n        But in the table, freeway 4: (48,83,left,36): this is left-moving. Then at turn 27, the span is [48,83]. Then at a future turn T, it becomes [48-36*(T-27), 83-36*(T-27)].\n\n        Now, we need to check if 0 is in the span. For a span [a,b] (with a<=b) we have a<=0<=b. But note: the span for a right-moving car is [tau+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)] and for left-moving: [h-s*(T-t1), tau-s*(T-t1)]. \n\n        However, the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(T)=[h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\". But if h=48 and tau=83, then at T=27: [48,83]. Then at T=28: [48-36, 83-36] = [12,47]. Then at T=29: [12-36=-24, 47-36=11]. \n\n        But note: the head is at 48 at T=27 and then moves left to 12 at T=28, so the head is the leftmost? Then the tail is at 83 at T=27 and moves left to 47 at T=28. So the entire car is moving left. The span is [head, tail]? But 12 to 47? Then 0 is not in [12,47] at T=28.\n\n        However, at T=27: [48,83] does not contain 0. At T=28: [12,47] does not contain 0. At T=29: [-24,11] does contain 0? because -24<=0<=11.\n\n        Similarly, for a right-moving car: freeway 1: (head=-48, tail=-95, direction=right, speed=48). \n          Initial span at T=27: [tau, h] = [-95, -48]? because the problem says for right-moving: Span(t1)=[tau, h]. Then at T: [ -95 + 48*(T-27), -48 + 48*(T-27) ].\n\n        At T=27: [-95, -48] -> doesn't contain 0.\n        At T=28: [-95+48, -48+48] = [-47,0] -> contains 0? because -47<=0<=0? (if the span is inclusive).\n\n        The problem says: collision if 0 in the span. So at T=28, if the player is on freeway 1, then collision.\n\nBut note: the car on freeway 1 is at freeway 1. So if the player is at freeway 1 at turn 28, then collision.\n\nNow, let's list all freeways and their cars at turn 27:\n\nFreeway 1: right-moving: head=-48, tail=-95, s=48.\n  Span at T: [ -95 + 48*(T-27), -48 + 48*(T-27) ]\n\nFreeway 2: two cars: \n  Car1: (48,37,right,12) -> wait, head=48, tail=37? But the problem says for right-moving: the span is [tau, head]. So we need to know which is the head and which is the tail. The problem defines the car as (head, tail, ...). For right-moving, the head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the rear? So if the car is moving right, then the tail is behind. So the initial span is [tail, head] = [37,48]? But the problem says: for right-moving, the initial span is [tau, head]. \n\n  However, the problem states: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, ...)\". Then for a right-moving car, the initial span is [tau, h]. So car1 on freeway2: tau=37, h=48? Then initial span: [37,48] at T=27. Then at T: [37+12*(T-27), 48+12*(T-27)].\n\n  But wait, the table says: (48,37,right,12). So head=48, tail=37. Then the initial span is [tail, head] = [37,48]. \n\n  Similarly, the second car on freeway2: (0,-11,right,12): head=0, tail=-11. Then initial span: [-11,0]. \n\n  So freeway2 has two cars: \n      car1: [37,48] at T=27 -> [37+12*(T-27), 48+12*(T-27)]\n      car2: [-11,0] at T=27 -> [-11+12*(T-27), 0+12*(T-27)]\n\nFreeway3: same as freeway2: two cars: \n      car1: (48,37,right,12) -> [37,48] at T=27 -> [37+12*(T-27),48+12*(T-27)]\n      car2: (0,-11,right,12) -> [-11,0] at T=27 -> [-11+12*(T-27), 12*(T-27)]\n\nFreeway4: (48,83,left,36): head=48, tail=83. For left-moving, the initial span is [head, tail] = [48,83]. Then at T: [48-36*(T-27), 83-36*(T-27)]\n\nFreeway5: same as freeway4: (48,83,left,36) -> [48,83] at T=27 -> [48-36*(T-27), 83-36*(T-27)]\n\nFreeway6: (-48,-59,right,6): head=-48, tail=-59. For right-moving: initial span = [tau, head] = [-59,-48]. Then at T: [-59+6*(T-27), -48+6*(T-27)]\n\nFreeway7: two cars: \n      car1: (48,37,right,4) -> [37,48] at T=27 -> [37+4*(T-27),48+4*(T-27)]\n      car2: (0,-11,right,4) -> [-11,0] at T=27 -> [-11+4*(T-27),4*(T-27)]\n\nFreeway8: (-48,-59,right,3) -> head=-48, tail=-59. For right-moving: initial span = [-59,-48] -> at T: [-59+3*(T-27), -48+3*(T-27)]\n\nWe are going to simulate the state (turn, y) and the path. We want the minimal H such that at turn = 27 + H - 1, we are at y=9.\n\nWe start at (27,0). We then consider actions: U, D, S. But at y=0, D is not allowed (would go to -1, so not allowed). So at (27,0): only U or S.\n\nBut if we choose S, we stay at 0. Then at the next turn we are still at 0. We can do that, but it doesn't help to move up. So we should choose U to move to y=1 at turn 28.\n\nBut then at turn 28, we are at y=1. We must check freeway1 at turn28: \n  Freeway1: right-moving car: \n      T=28: [ -95 + 48*(28-27), -48 + 48*(28-27) ] = [ -95+48, -48+48 ] = [-47,0]\n  We are at y=1 at turn28? But the freeway for y=1 is freeway1. Then we check: is 0 in the span? The span is [-47,0] -> and 0 is included. So we collide.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at freeway1 at turn28.\n\nSo we must avoid freeway1 at turn28. How? We must not be at y=1 at turn28.\n\nBut we are starting at y=0 at turn27. If we choose U at turn27, we go to y=1 at turn28. That causes collision.\n\nSo we cannot choose U at turn27.\n\nWhat about S? Then we stay at y=0 at turn28. Then at turn28, we are at y=0 (not a freeway) so no collision. Then at turn28, we can choose U (to go to y=1 at turn29) or S again.\n\nBut if we choose U at turn28, then at turn29 we are at y=1. Check freeway1 at turn29:\n  T=29: [ -95+48*(29-27), -48+48*(29-27) ] = [ -95+96, -48+96 ] = [1, 48] -> contains 0? No. So no collision at turn29 on freeway1? But we are at y=1, and the car is on freeway1, and the car's span is [1,48] at T=29 -> does not contain 0. So safe.\n\nBut wait: the car's span is [1,48] at T=29: so it covers from 1 to 48. Does it cover 0? No. So we are safe.\n\nBut note: the collision condition is: if the player is on freeway i at turn T, and 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway. At T=29, we are at freeway1 (y=1) and the car covers [1,48] -> so 0 is not in [1,48]. Therefore, safe.\n\nSo one possibility: \n  Turn27: S -> then at turn28: y=0 (safe, not freeway)\n  Turn28: U -> then at turn29: y=1 (freeway1) -> check freeway1 at T=29: [1,48] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n\nThen from there we can go up.\n\nBut we need to go to 9. The minimal moves: from 0 to 9: 9 moves of U. But we are already using 2 turns to get to y=1 at turn29. Then we need 8 more moves to get to 9. So at turn29: we are at y=1. Then we can do U at turn29 -> y=2 at turn30.\n\nThen we must check freeway2 at turn30? Because at turn30 we are at y=2.\n\nFreeway2 has two cars at turn30 (T=30, which is 30-27=3 steps from start):\n\n  car1: [37+12*3, 48+12*3] = [37+36, 48+36] = [73,84] -> doesn't contain 0 -> safe.\n  car2: [-11+12*3, 0+12*3] = [-11+36, 36] = [25,36] -> doesn't contain 0 -> safe.\n\nSo safe at turn30 at y=2.\n\nThen at turn30: we choose U -> y=3 at turn31.\n\nFreeway3 at turn31: T=31 -> 31-27=4\n  car1: [37+12*4,48+48] = [37+48,48+48] = [85,96] -> safe.\n  car2: [-11+12*4, 0+48] = [-11+48,48] = [37,48] -> safe.\n\nThen turn31: U -> y=4 at turn32.\n\nFreeway4 at turn32: T=32 -> 32-27=5\n  car: [48-36*5, 83-36*5] = [48-180,83-180] = [-132, -97] -> doesn't contain 0 -> safe.\n\nThen turn32: U -> y=5 at turn33.\n\nFreeway5 at turn33: T=33 -> 33-27=6\n  car: [48-36*6,83-36*6] = [48-216,83-216] = [-168,-133] -> safe.\n\nThen turn33: U -> y=6 at turn34.\n\nFreeway6 at turn34: T=34 -> 34-27=7\n  car: [-59+6*7, -48+6*7] = [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6] -> safe.\n\nThen turn34: U -> y=7 at turn35.\n\nFreeway7 at turn35: T=35 -> 35-27=8\n  car1: [37+4*8,48+32] = [37+32,48+32] = [69,80] -> safe.\n  car2: [-11+4*8, 0+32] = [-11+32,32] = [21,32] -> safe.\n\nThen turn35: U -> y=8 at turn36.\n\nFreeway8 at turn36: T=36 -> 36-27=9\n  car: [-59+3*9, -48+3*9] = [-59+27, -48+27] = [-32,-21] -> safe.\n\nThen turn36: U -> y=9 at turn37.\n\nAt turn37: we are at y=9 -> goal. \n\nBut the problem requires that we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. Here, t1=27, and we are at 9 at turn37. Then 37 = 27+H-1 => H-1=10 => H=11.\n\nSo the sequence of actions: we took actions from turn27 to turn36 (10 actions) and then at turn37 we are at 9. But the goal is to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1=27+H-1. So 27+H-1=37 -> H=11.\n\nTherefore, we need to output 11 actions? But the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1 (i.e., 11 actions: at turns 27 to 37-1=36). \n\nBut note: the state at turn37 is the result of the action at turn36. And we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn37? Actually, we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn37. Then we take an action at turn37? But the problem says: we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So if H=11, then turn t1+H-1 = 27+11-1=37. So we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn37. Then we must take an action at turn37? But that is the 11th action (since the sequence has 11 actions: from t=0 to 10).\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, which are turns 27 to 27+10=37? But then the last action is at turn37? But the state at the beginning of turn37 is (0,9) and then we take an action at turn37. But we don't need to move further? So we can take S.\n\nSo the sequence would be:\n\n  Turn27: S\n  Turn28: U\n  Turn29: U\n  Turn30: U\n  Turn31: U\n  Turn32: U\n  Turn33: U\n  Turn34: U\n  Turn35: U\n  Turn36: U\n  Turn37: S   [but wait, we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn37? Then we take S to stay?]\n\nBut note: after the action at turn36 (which was U) we moved to y=9 at turn37. Then at the beginning of turn37 we are at y=9. Then we take an action at turn37 (which is the 11th action) and we can choose S.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, which is turn37. Then we are done? But we are taking an action at that turn? However, the goal condition is met at the beginning of the turn. So we can output the sequence that ends with an action at turn37.\n\nBut we don't need to move beyond 9? So we can choose S at the last step.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid the extra S? But the problem says we must output a sequence of H actions, and H=11. So we must output 11 actions.\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence? \n\nWe started with a delay at turn27 (S) and then moved up every turn. Total moves: 1 (S) + 9 (U) + 1 (S at the end) = 11? But the last S is at the turn when we are already at 9. \n\nBut note: we are at y=9 at turn37. Then the goal is achieved at the beginning of turn37. So we don't need to take an action? But the problem requires a sequence of H actions until turn t1+H-1=37. So we take an action at turn37? \n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1. Since H=11, the last action is at turn t1+H-1 = 27+10 = 37? But wait: the sequence index: t from 0 to H-1 (which is 10) -> so the actions are at turns: 27+0, 27+1, ..., 27+10? That is turns 27 to 37. \n\nBut we are only simulating until turn37? And then the state at the beginning of turn37 is the result of the action at turn36? And then we take an action at turn37? But that action might not be necessary. However, the problem says we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. And t1+H-1=27+11-1=37. So we are at (0,9) at turn37, and we take an action at turn37? \n\nBut the problem says: we are to output the actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1. So we must output an action for turn37.\n\nSo the sequence has 11 actions: for turns 27,28,...,37.\n\nBut the state at the beginning of turn37 is (0,9) and then we take an action (S) to stay at 9. Then the next state (turn38) is (0,9) but we don't care.\n\nBut the problem does not require the state after the last action, only that at the last turn (37) we are at (0,9).\n\nSo the sequence we have:\n\n  Turn27: S\n  Turn28: U\n  Turn29: U\n  Turn30: U\n  Turn31: U\n  Turn32: U\n  Turn33: U\n  Turn34: U\n  Turn35: U\n  Turn36: U   -> this leads to y=9 at turn37 (beginning of turn37: y=9)\n  Turn37: S   -> we stay at 9.\n\nBut note: at turn36, we are at y=8. Then we choose U -> so we move to y=9 at turn37. Then at turn37, we are at y=9 (so the goal condition is met at the beginning of turn37). Then we take S at turn37 to stay.\n\nIs there a way to get to 9 earlier? \n\nWe started at turn27 at y=0. The minimal time to go from 0 to 9 is 9 moves (if we go up every turn). But we had to do S at the first turn to avoid collision at turn28. Then we go up from turn28 to turn36: 9 moves? That would be 10 turns (from turn27 to turn36) and then at turn36 we would be at y=9? \n\nBut in our sequence, at turn36 we are at y=8 and we do U to get to y=9 at turn37. So we are at 9 at turn37.\n\nCan we be at 9 at turn36? \n\nTo be at 9 at turn36: then we must have been at 8 at turn35 and then moved up at turn35. Or at 9 at turn35 and then did nothing? \n\nBut we started at 0 at turn27. The number of turns from 27 to 36 is 9 turns. We need 9 moves up. So we can do:\n\n  Turn27: U -> but then at turn28 we are at y=1 and collide? because freeway1 at turn28: [-47,0] -> 0 in the span -> collision.\n\n  So we cannot do U at turn27.\n\n  What if we do S at turn27, then U at turn28, then U at turn29, ... and then U at turn35: that would be 8 moves? from turn28 to turn35: 8 moves -> y=8 at turn35? Then at turn35 we are at y=8. Then at turn36: we are at y=9 (if we do U at turn35). Then the state at the beginning of turn36 is y=9? \n\n  But the goal requires at turn t1+H-1 = 27+H-1 = 36? Then H-1=9 -> H=10.\n\n  So we want to be at (0,9) at turn36. Then the sequence would be 10 actions: from turn27 to turn36.\n\n  How?\n    Turn27: S -> y=0 at turn28.\n    Turn28: U -> y=1 at turn29 (safe, as we checked: freeway1 at turn29: [1,48] -> no 0)\n    Turn29: U -> y=2 at turn30 (freeway2: safe as above)\n    Turn30: U -> y=3 at turn31 (freeway3: safe)\n    Turn31: U -> y=4 at turn32 (freeway4: safe)\n    Turn32: U -> y=5 at turn33 (freeway5: safe)\n    Turn33: U -> y=6 at turn34 (freeway6: safe)\n    Turn34: U -> y=7 at turn35 (freeway7: safe)\n    Turn35: U -> y=8 at turn36? But wait, we want to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn36? \n\n  Actually, the action at turn35 is U: so if at turn35 we are at y=7, then after U we are at y=8 at turn36. Not 9.\n\n  We are at turn35: we are at y=7. Then we do U: we go to y=8 at turn36. Then we are not at 9.\n\n  To get to 9 at turn36, we must be at 8 at the beginning of turn35? Then we do U at turn35 to get to 9 at turn36. But at the beginning of turn35 we are at y=8? \n\n  How to get to y=8 at the beginning of turn35? \n\n  Start: turn27: y=0.\n  Then:\n    turn27: S -> turn28: y=0\n    turn28: U -> turn29: y=1\n    turn29: U -> turn30: y=2\n    turn30: U -> turn31: y=3\n    turn31: U -> turn32: y=4\n    turn32: U -> turn33: y=5\n    turn33: U -> turn34: y=6\n    turn34: U -> turn35: y=7? \n\n  Then at turn35: we are at y=7. Then we do U: we go to y=8 at turn36.\n\n  We are one step short.\n\n  Alternatively, we need to move up 9 times. But we started with S at turn27, so we only moved up 8 times from turn28 to turn35. Then we are at y=8 at turn36. \n\n  To get to y=9 at turn36, we need to have moved 9 times. But we started at turn27 and by turn36 we have 9 moves? \n\n  The moves: \n    turn27: S (doesn't move up)\n    turn28: U (1)\n    turn29: U (2)\n    turn30: U (3)\n    turn31: U (4)\n    turn32: U (5)\n    turn33: U (6)\n    turn34: U (7)\n    turn35: U (8) -> then at turn36: y=8.\n\n  We need one more U at turn36 to get to y=9 at turn37.\n\n  So we cannot get to y=9 at turn36.\n\n  Therefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nBut wait: what if we do two S at the beginning? Then we are still at 0 at turn28 and turn29? Then we start moving at turn29. Then we get to 9 at turn38? which would be H=12.\n\n  H=12: then we are at 9 at turn 27+12-1 = 38. Then we output 12 actions.\n\n  But 11 is better.\n\nAlternatively, can we go faster by moving up at turn27? We saw that leads to collision at turn28.\n\nWhat if we go down? But we are at 0, we cannot go down.\n\nOr what if we do U at turn27 and then D? But that would be:\n\n  turn27: U -> then at turn28: y=1 -> collision? because freeway1 at turn28: [ -95+48, -48+48 ] = [-47,0] -> 0 in the span -> collision.\n\n  So we cannot do U at turn27.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\n  Turn27: S\n  Turn28: U\n  Turn29: U\n  Turn30: U\n  Turn31: U\n  Turn32: U\n  Turn33: U\n  Turn34: U\n  Turn35: U\n  Turn36: U   -> leads to y=9 at turn37 (beginning of turn37: y=9)\n  Turn37: S   -> we stay at 9.\n\nBut note: at turn37 we are at y=9 (not a freeway) so no collision check. Then we do S: which is safe.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to avoid collisions only on freeways. So at turn37, we are safe.\n\nBut we must check that at every turn when we were on a freeway (y=1 to 8) we didn't collide. We did check:\n\n  turn29: y=1 -> freeway1: T=29 -> [1,48] -> safe.\n  turn30: y=2 -> freeway2: T=30 -> [73,84] and [25,36] -> safe.\n  turn31: y=3 -> freeway3: T=31 -> [85,96] and [37,48] -> safe.\n  turn32: y=4 -> freeway4: T=32 -> [-132,-97] -> safe.\n  turn33: y=5 -> freeway5: T=33 -> [-168,-133] -> safe.\n  turn34: y=6 -> freeway6: T=34 -> [-17,-6] -> safe.\n  turn35: y=7 -> freeway7: T=35 -> [69,80] and [21,32] -> safe.\n  turn36: y=8 -> freeway8: T=36 -> [-32,-21] -> safe.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nBut note: at turn36 we are at y=8 and we choose U. Then at turn36 we are on freeway8? Yes, and we checked freeway8 at turn36: safe. Then we move to y=9 at turn37.\n\nTherefore, the answer is H=11 and the sequence:\n\nTurn27: S\nTurn28: U\nTurn29: U\nTurn30: U\nTurn31: U\nTurn32: U\nTurn33: U\nTurn34: U\nTurn35: U\nTurn36: U\nTurn37: S\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Here H=11, so t from 0 to 10: 11 actions.\n\nAnd the turns: t1 + t = 27 + t, for t=0 to 10: turns 27 to 37.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 27: S\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: S\n}\n\nBut note: at turn37 we are at y=9 and we do S. But we don't need to do anything? However, the problem requires an action at that turn. And we are allowed to do S.\n\nIs there a way to avoid the last S? But we have to output 11 actions.\n\nAlternatively, we might get to 9 earlier by a different route? For example, if we go down at some point? But we are at 0 initially and we need to go to 9, so going down doesn't help.\n\nOr if we skip a freeway by moving faster? But we can only move one step per turn.\n\nAnother idea: wait for two turns at the beginning? Then we start moving at turn28: S, then at turn29: U. Then we get to y=1 at turn30? \n\nAt turn30: freeway1: T=30 -> [ -95+48*(30-27), -48+48*3] = [ -95+144, -48+144] = [49,96] -> safe? Then we can go up. But then we get to 9 at turn38? which is H=12: worse.\n\nSo the above sequence is minimal.\n\nBut note: we assumed that the freeway cars are the only obstacles. And we checked the collisions for the freeways we passed.\n\nBut what about freeway1 at turn28: we avoided it by not being there. But what if we are at freeway1 at a different turn? In our sequence we only passed freeway1 at turn29, which was safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=11.\n\nNow, let me double-check the last turn: at turn37, we are at (0,9) and we do S. Then we are still at (0,9) at turn38. But the problem does not require anything beyond turn37.\n\nSo it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the final answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 27\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at each turn.\n\n- At turn 27, the player is at \\((0, 0)\\) and chooses action \\(S\\) (stay), remaining at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 28. Since \\(y = 0\\) is not a freeway, no collision check is needed.\n- At turn 28, the player chooses \\(U\\) (up), moving to \\(y = 1\\) for turn 29. At turn 29, the player is on freeway 1. The car on freeway 1 at turn 29 (\\(T = 29\\)) has a span of \\([1, 48]\\) (computed as \\([-48 - 48 \\times (29-27), -95 - 48 \\times (29-27)]\\) is incorrect; the correct update for the right-moving car with head \\(h = -48\\), tail \\(\\tau = -95\\), speed \\(s = 48\\) is span at \\(T\\): \\([\\tau + s \\times (T - 27), h + s \\times (T - 27)]\\). At \\(T = 29\\): \\([-95 + 48 \\times 2, -48 + 48 \\times 2] = [-95 + 96, -48 + 96] = [1, 48]\\). Since 0 is not in \\([1, 48]\\), no collision occurs.\n- The player continues moving up each turn, reaching \\(y = 2\\) at turn 30, \\(y = 3\\) at turn 31, \\(y = 4\\) at turn 32, \\(y = 5\\) at turn 33, \\(y = 6\\) at turn 34, \\(y = 7\\) at turn 35, and \\(y = 8\\) at turn 36. Collision checks for each freeway at the respective turns confirm safety:\n  - Freeway 2 at turn 30: cars have spans \\([73, 84]\\) and \\([25, 36]\\), 0 not in either.\n  - Freeway 3 at turn 31: cars have spans \\([85, 96]\\) and \\([37, 48]\\), 0 not in either.\n  - Freeway 4 at turn 32: car has span \\([-132, -97]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Freeway 5 at turn 33: car has span \\([-168, -133]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Freeway 6 at turn 34: car has span \\([-17, -6]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Freeway 7 at turn 35: cars have spans \\([69, 80]\\) and \\([21, 32]\\), 0 not in either.\n  - Freeway 8 at turn 36: car has span \\([-32, -21]\\), 0 not in span.\n- At turn 36, the player chooses \\(U\\), moving to \\(y = 9\\) for turn 37. At the beginning of turn 37, the player is at \\((0, 9)\\), achieving the goal. An action \\(S\\) is chosen at turn 37 to remain at \\(y = 9\\), but since \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway, no collision check is needed.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns 27 to 37 (11 actions) is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 27: S\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 28 and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: y increases by 1), down (D: y decreases by 1), or stay (S: y unchanged). The player must stay within y in [0,9].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T (which is one of 1..8) and at that turn T, the x=0 is inside the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nNote: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is still on y_T. Then at turn T+1, the player is on y_{T+1}. So we only check the freeway we are currently on at each turn.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn t1 (28) until we reach y=9.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1 (28) for each freeway (1 to 8). For each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the representation:\n\n- For a right-moving car: the span is [tail, head] (with tail <= head) and at time T, the car moves so that at time T, the span is [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)].\n- For a left-moving car: the span is [head, tail] (but note that head and tail are given, and the car moves left. Actually, the problem states:\n    Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  But note that in the input, for freeway 4 and 5 we have (12,47,left,36). Since it's left-moving, the head is 12 and tail is 47? That seems backwards because typically the head is the front. However, the update rule for left-moving is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. So if h=12 and τ=47, then at time t1, the car spans from 12 to 47? But that would be a right-moving car? Let's read the update:\n\n  Actually, the problem says for left-moving: \n      Span(t1) = [h, τ] → becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  This implies that at time t1, the car occupies from h to τ (which is from 12 to 47) and then moves left (so decreasing x). But note: the representation for left-moving in the input is (head, tail) but the update uses h and τ. The problem states for left-moving: \n        \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ]\"\n  and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\n  However, in the input for freeway 4: (12,47,left,36). So h=12, τ=47. Then at time t1=28, the car is from 12 to 47. Then at a later time T, it becomes [12 - 36*(T-28), 47 - 36*(T-28)]. Since the car is moving left, the entire segment moves left.\n\n  Similarly, for right-moving, the input example: freeway 2 has (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12). But note: for right-moving, the update rule is:\n        [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n  and the problem states: for right-moving, Span(t1)=[τ, h]? Actually, the problem says:\n        \"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\n  However, in the input for freeway 2, the first car is (60,49,right,12). If we interpret as (h, τ) = (60,49) then for right-moving, the span at t1 would be [τ, h] = [49,60]. But the input says head=60 and tail=49? That would imply the car is from 49 to 60? That makes sense because the head is the front and tail is the rear. But the update rule for right-moving uses [τ, h] as the initial span? So we must interpret the input as:\n\n  For a car (head, tail, direction, speed):\n    - If direction is right: then at time t1, the car occupies [tail, head] (because the update rule uses [τ, h] and τ is tail and h is head) and moves right.\n    - If direction is left: then at time t1, the car occupies [head, tail] (because the update rule uses [h, τ]) and moves left.\n\n  But wait, the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1)=[h,τ]\" and for right-moving: \"Span(t1)=[τ,h]\". So:\n\n      Right: [τ, h] -> meaning from τ to h (with τ <= h) -> so the car is from τ to h.\n      Left: [h, τ] -> meaning from h to τ? But note that in the update for left, the car moves left so the entire segment shifts left. However, the input for left has head=12 and tail=47, which would imply the car is from 12 to 47? But that is a long car (36 units) and moving left? But 12 to 47 is a positive direction? Actually, the problem doesn't specify the order of head and tail. We must rely on the update.\n\n  Let me clarify with the update:\n\n  For freeway 4: (12,47,left,36) at t1=28: the car is at [12,47] (so from x=12 to x=47) and then at T>28, it becomes [12 - 36*(T-28), 47 - 36*(T-28)].\n\n  For freeway 2: (60,49,right,12): for a right-moving car, the initial span is [49,60] (because [τ, h] = [49,60])? But that would be a car of length 11? Then at T, it becomes [49+12*(T-28), 60+12*(T-28)].\n\n  However, note that the second car on freeway 2: (12,1,right,12) -> initial span [1,12]. That makes sense.\n\n  But the first car (60,49,right,12): if the initial span is [49,60], that's a car from 49 to 60. But then at time T, it moves to [49+12*(T-28), 60+12*(T-28)]. \n\n  The problem says: collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on the freeway y_T and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at time T.\n\n  We are at x=0 always, so we care when a car spans over 0.\n\n  We need to compute for each freeway and each car, at a given time T (relative to t1=28), whether the car covers x=0.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  1. We are starting at (0,0) at turn 28. We must avoid being on a freeway (y=1..8) at a turn T when any car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that exact T.\n\n  2. We want the minimal H such that we can be at (0,9) at turn (28 + H - 1). Note: the sequence of actions is from t=28 to t=28+H-1 (so H actions) and after H actions we are at turn 28+H-1? Actually, the player update:\n\n        At turn 28 (current): we are at y_28 = 0.\n        Then we choose action a_28 -> then at turn 29, we are at y_29 = y_28 + Δy_28.\n\n        So after H actions (from t=28 to t=28+H-1), we have H moves and we are at turn 28+H, and the position is y_{28+H}.\n\n        But note: we are to output until the turn when we first reach (0,9). We want to be at (0,9) at turn 28 + H - 1? \n\n        Let me see: \n          t = 28: we are at (0,0). We take action a_28 -> then at t=29, we are at y_29 = 0 + Δy_28.\n          ...\n          After t actions from 28 to 28+H-1 (so H actions), we have updated H times and we are at turn 28+H? \n\n        However, the problem says: sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} meaning:\n          t=0: a_{t1+0} = a_28\n          t=1: a_29\n          ...\n          t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1} = a_{28+H-1}\n\n        Then after these H actions, the player is at y_{28+H}? But note the update: \n          y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\n        So after the last action (at turn 28+H-1), we get y_{28+H} = y_{28+H-1} + Δy_{28+H-1}.\n\n        We want y_{28+H} = 9.\n\n        Therefore, the total turns we simulate: from t=28 to t=28+H-1 (H actions) and we are at turn 28+H (the state after the last action) at position 9.\n\n        But note: we must avoid collisions during the entire path. Specifically, for each turn from 28 to 28+H-1, we are at a position y_t (which is the position at the beginning of the turn? Actually, the problem states: at turn T, the player is at position (0, y_T). Then we choose an action a_T, and then the next turn T+1 we are at y_{T+1}. \n\n        However, the collision condition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\".\n\n        So at turn T, we are at y_T and we check the cars on freeway y_T at time T.\n\n        Therefore, for each turn T from 28 to 28+H-1, we are at y_T and we must not be collided. Note that at the final turn 28+H, we are at (0,9) and we don't need to take an action? But the problem says we are to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the position after these actions is at turn t1+H? But the problem says we want to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\n        Let me read: \"minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\n        So the position at turn t1+H-1 is 9. How does that work?\n\n        We start at turn t1 (28) at position y_{28}=0.\n        Then at turn t1 (28) we take an action a_{28} -> then at turn t1+1 (29), we are at y_{29} = y_{28} + Δy_{28}.\n        Then at turn t1+1 (29) we take an action a_{29} -> then at turn t1+2 (30), we are at y_{30} = y_{29} + Δy_{29}.\n        ...\n        After H actions, we have taken actions at turns 28, 29, ... 28+H-1, and the position at turn 28+H is y_{28+H}. \n\n        But we want the position at turn 28+H-1 to be 9? That would be after H-1 actions? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t=0,...,H-1, so the last action is at t1+H-1. Then the position at the next turn (t1+H) is computed. But the problem says we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\n        This seems inconsistent.\n\n        Let me reexamine the problem statement:\n\n          \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n          and then \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\n        So the position at turn t1+H-1 is 9. How do we get that?\n\n        Note: the player update: \n            y_{t+1} = y_t + a_t   (where a_t is the action at turn t)\n\n        Therefore, the position at turn t is the result of all actions taken from turn 0 to t-1? \n\n        But here, we start at turn t1 with position 0. Then:\n\n          turn t1: y_{t1} = 0 (given)\n          turn t1+1: y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n          turn t1+2: y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy_{t1+1}\n          ...\n\n        So the position at turn t1+k is the result of k actions (from t1 to t1+k-1).\n\n        We want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\n        That means we have taken H-1 actions? Then H would be the number of actions? But the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, meaning H actions? \n\n        Alternatively, note: the index of the last action is t1+H-1, and we want the position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9. But the position at turn t1+H-1 is determined by the actions from t1 to t1+H-2? \n\n        This is confusing. Let me denote:\n\n          t = t1: y_{t1} = 0 (initial state at turn t1)\n          after action a_{t1} (at turn t1): then at turn t1+1, we have y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\n          We want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\n          So the position at turn t1+H-1 is the result of H-1 actions? Then the sequence of actions would be of length H-1? But the problem says the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, which is H actions.\n\n        There seems to be a discrepancy.\n\n        Let me look at the example answer format:\n\n          Turn t1: a_{t1}\n          Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n          ...\n          (until we have H actions)\n\n        and then we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence is H actions. And we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\n        How can we be at 9 at turn t1+H-1? That requires that after H-1 actions we are at 9. But the sequence has H actions. \n\n        Alternatively, the problem might mean that we take H actions and then at the next turn (turn t1+H) we are at 9? But then the condition would be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\n        However, the problem states: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\n        I think there is a misunderstanding. Let me reread the problem:\n\n          \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n          and then: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\n        So H is the minimal number of turns? But note: the sequence of actions is for turns from t1 to t1+H-1, so we are acting for H turns? Then the position at turn t1+H-1 is the state at the beginning of that turn? \n\n        Actually, the problem states: at turn t1, we are at (0,y_{t1}). Then we take action a_{t1} and then the next state is at turn t1+1. \n\n        The collision condition is checked at each turn T (from t1 to t1+H-1) because at turn T we are at y_T and we check the cars on freeway y_T at time T.\n\n        And we want at the turn t1+H-1, the position y_{t1+H-1} to be 9.\n\n        How many actions have been taken to get to y_{t1+H-1}? \n\n          - At turn t1: we are at y_{t1}=0 (given).\n          - Then we take action a_{t1}: then at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1} = 0 + Δy_{t1}.\n          - ...\n          - To be at y_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1, we have taken H-1 actions (from t1 to t1+H-2).\n\n        But the problem says the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, which includes H actions. That would imply we are taking an extra action?\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might mean that we take H actions and then at the turn t1+H we are at 9? But then we would require that at turn t1+H we are at 9, and we would have taken H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1). Then the position at turn t1+H is 9.\n\n        However, the problem explicitly says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\n        I see the confusion. The problem states:\n\n          \"Find a sequence of actions ... which minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\n        and the sequence is of length H? Then that would require that after H actions (taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1) we are at turn t1+H, and then the position at turn t1+H is y_{t1+H}. But we want y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n        This implies that the last action we take is at turn t1+H-1, and that action is applied to the state at turn t1+H-1 to get to turn t1+H. But we are not requiring anything about turn t1+H? We require the position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\n        How do we achieve that? \n\n        Note: we start at turn t1 at position 0. We want at turn t1+H-1 to be at 9. That means we have (H-1) moves? Then the sequence of actions should be of length H-1? \n\n        But the problem says the sequence is indexed from t=0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\n        This is a contradiction.\n\n        Let me look at the example in the problem statement? There is none.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might be using the term \"turn\" for the action step? But the game is turn-based and each turn we take one action.\n\n        I think the intended meaning is:\n\n          We are at turn t1 (28) at (0,0). We take actions at turns 28, 29, ... until we are at (0,9) at the beginning of some turn.\n\n          We want the minimal number of turns (meaning the minimal number of game turns) that we have to wait until we are at (0,9) at the beginning of that turn? \n\n          But note: we start at turn 28 at (0,0). Then we take actions. We want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn T. Then we need to define T.\n\n        How about we define:\n\n          Let T0 = t1 = 28: we are at y=0.\n          We want the smallest T (>=28) such that y_T = 9.\n\n        Then the number of actions we take is T - 28? Because we take one action per turn from 28 to T-1 (so T-28 actions). \n\n        Then H = T - 28? \n\n        And the sequence of actions is for turns 28, 29, ... T-1: which is H = T-28 actions.\n\n        Then the condition is: at turn T, we are at y_T=9, and we did not collide during turns 28 to T-1 (because at each of those turns we were at some y and we check the cars at that turn).\n\n        However, the problem states: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence is of length H, and we want y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n        If we let T = t1 + H - 1, then at turn T we are at 9. Then the number of actions is (T - t1) = (t1+H-1 - t1) = H-1? But the sequence is of length H.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might be counting the starting turn as one of the turns? \n\n        I think the intended meaning is that H is the number of actions (the number of turns we take actions) and then we are at 9 at turn t1+H. But the problem explicitly says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n        After re-thinking, I found a possible interpretation:\n\n          We start at turn t1 (28) and we take an action at turn t1, then at turn t1+1 we take another, etc.\n\n          The state at the beginning of turn t1 is given.\n\n          After taking action at turn t1, we get to state at the beginning of turn t1+1.\n\n          ...\n\n          After taking action at turn t1+H-1, we get to state at the beginning of turn t1+H.\n\n          But we want the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 to be 9? That would be before we take the last action? \n\n          That doesn't make sense because then we would take an action at turn t1+H-1 and then leave 9.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might mean that we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H? Then we take H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1) and then at turn t1+H we are at 9.\n\n        And the minimal H is the minimal number of actions? \n\n        And the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence is for H turns (actions). Then that matches.\n\n        But the problem explicitly says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\n        This is very confusing.\n\n        I notice the problem says: \"the current turn is t1\", and then we are to output actions for turns t1, t1+1, ... until the last action at turn t1+H-1. Then the next turn (t1+H) is not taken an action? And we require y_{t1+H-1}=9? That means we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action at that turn? Then we would leave 9.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might mean that we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H? \n\n        Given the confusion, I will assume the problem means that we are to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H, and we have taken H actions (from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1). Then H is the number of actions (which is the number of turns we are acting). \n\n        Why? Because that is the common way: we start at turn t1 and take actions for H consecutive turns (t1 to t1+H-1) and then at turn t1+H we are at 9.\n\n        And the minimal H is the minimal number of actions required.\n\n        And we must avoid collisions on turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1? Because at each of these turns we are at a position y and we check the cars at that turn.\n\n        At turn t1+H, we are at 9 and we don't take an action? So we don't need to avoid collision at turn t1+H? \n\n        But the problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars\" during the game. And the goal is to reach (0,9). Once we are at (0,9) we are done and we don't care about future collisions? \n\n        However, note that (0,9) is the goal and it's not a freeway? The freeways are y=1..8. So at y=9, there are no cars. Therefore, at turn t1+H, we are at y=9 and no collision check is needed (since collision only occurs on freeways 1..8). \n\n        Therefore, we only care about collisions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1.\n\n        So I will proceed with:\n\n          We are at turn t1 (28) at y=0.\n          We take an action at each turn from 28 to 28+H-1 (H actions).\n          Then at turn 28+H, we are at y=9.\n\n          We want the minimal H and the sequence of actions.\n\n        Then the condition: for each turn T in {28, 29, ..., 28+H-1}, we are at y_T (which is between 0 and 9) and if y_T is in {1,...,8} then we must avoid the cars on freeway y_T at time T.\n\n        And we start at T=28: y_28=0 -> no collision (since freeways are 1..8) and 0 is safe.\n\n        The goal: at turn 28+H, we are at y_{28+H}=9 -> and we don't check collision at turn 28+H because we are done and also y=9 is not a freeway.\n\n        Therefore, we must simulate the moves and ensure that for every turn T from 28 to 28+H-1, the player is at a position that is either 0,9 (which are safe) or if in 1..8 then no car on that freeway at time T covers x=0.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          1. We need to know for each freeway (1..8) and for each car on that freeway, at a given time T (absolute turn, starting from 28) whether the car covers x=0.\n\n          2. We are to find a path from y=0 (at turn28) to y=9 (at turn28+H) with minimal H, by moving at most one step per turn (U, D, S) and avoiding collisions.\n\n        Since H is minimal and we start at 0 and want to go to 9, the minimal H without any cars would be 9 (if we move up every turn). But we have to avoid cars, so we might have to wait (stay) or even move down sometimes? But moving down from 0 is not allowed because y must be in [0,9] and if we try to move down from 0, we stay at 0.\n\n        Actually, the problem says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and we clamp to [0,9]. So if at y_t=0 and we choose D, then Δy_t = -1, but then y_{t+1}=0-1 -> but it must be in [0,9] so it becomes 0? Similarly, at y_t=9 and we choose U, we stay at 9.\n\n        Therefore, we can model the state as (turn, y) and we start at (28,0). We want to reach any state (T,9) with minimal T (so minimal T-28, and then T-28 is H? but note we defined H as the number of actions, and T = 28+H). \n\n        Actually, we want to minimize H (the number of actions) which is T - 28 (if T is the turn at which we are at 9).\n\n        We can do a BFS in the state (turn, y). The turn can go up to ...? The cars are moving and their positions are linear in time, so we can compute for any turn T the car positions.\n\n        However, the minimal H is at least 9 (if we go straight up). But we might have to wait, so H>=9.\n\n        But note: we might be able to go faster? Actually, we can only move one step per turn. So we need at least 9 moves upward. Therefore, minimal H is 9? But we might have to wait at some freeways? So H could be more than 9.\n\n        We are to find the minimal H (number of actions) and the sequence.\n\n        We'll do a BFS (or Dijkstra, but all moves cost 1) over the state (y, turn) but the turn can be large. However, we note that the car positions are periodic? \n\n        But let's compute the car positions at a given time T for each freeway.\n\n        We'll precompute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each car on that freeway, the time intervals (or modulo) when the car covers 0.\n\n        However, note that the cars move continuously. The car on freeway k at time T covers 0 if there is a car on freeway k such that 0 is in [a(T), b(T)] for that car.\n\n        For a car:\n\n          Right-moving: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n          Left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\n        We need 0 in that interval.\n\n        For a right-moving car: \n            τ + s*(T-28) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-28)\n        =>   (0 - h) / s <= T-28 <= (0 - τ) / s\n\n        But note: if the car is moving to the right, then as T increases, the car moves to the right. The car covers 0 only for a contiguous set of T? Actually, the interval for T might be:\n\n            T_min = ceil( (0 - h) / s ) + 28   [if (0-h)/s is negative, then the car has passed?]\n            T_max = floor( (0 - τ) / s ) + 28\n\n        But note: the car is present at 0 from the moment the front (h) passes 0 until the rear (τ) passes 0? Actually, the car covers 0 from when the rear passes 0 to when the front passes 0? \n\n        Actually, the car covers 0 at time T if the entire segment [τ+s*(T-28), h+s*(T-28)] contains 0, i.e., the segment must cover 0. This happens when:\n\n            τ + s*(T-28) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-28)\n\n        Rearranged:\n\n            ( -h ) / s <= T-28 <= ( -τ ) / s\n\n        But note: for the first car on freeway2: (60,49,right,12): then \n            τ=49, h=60, s=12.\n            Condition: 49 + 12*(T-28) <= 0 <= 60 + 12*(T-28)\n            -> 49 + 12*(T-28) <= 0 -> 12*(T-28) <= -49 -> T-28 <= -49/12 ≈ -4.08 -> T <= 23.92 -> so T<=23? but we are at T>=28 -> no solution.\n\n        Similarly, 0<=60+12*(T-28) is always true for T>=28. But the left condition fails. So this car never covers 0 for T>=28.\n\n        The other car on freeway2: (12,1,right,12): \n            τ=1, h=12, s=12.\n            Condition: 1+12*(T-28) <= 0 <= 12+12*(T-28)\n            Left: 1+12*(T-28)<=0 -> 12*(T-28)<=-1 -> T-28<=-1/12 -> T<=27.91... -> so for T>=28, this condition fails. \n            Right: 0<=12+12*(T-28) is always true for T>=28.\n\n        So freeway2 is safe at all times T>=28? \n\n        Similarly, freeway1: (0,-47,right,48) -> \n            τ=-47, h=0, s=48.\n            Condition: -47+48*(T-28) <= 0 <= 0+48*(T-28)\n            -> The right condition: 0<=48*(T-28) -> T>=28 -> always true for T>=28.\n            The left condition: -47+48*(T-28) <=0 -> 48*(T-28)<=47 -> T-28 <= 47/48 <1 -> T<=28.98 -> so T=28 is the only solution? \n\n            At T=28: \n                -47+48*0 = -47 <=0, and 0<=0 -> true. So at T=28, this car covers 0.\n\n        But note: we are at freeway1 only if the player is at y=1 at turn T. At turn T=28, the player is at y=0, so freeway1 is not checked. \n\n        However, if we move to y=1 at turn 29, then at turn 29 we are at y=1 and we check freeway1 at T=29.\n\n            At T=29: \n                -47+48*(1)=1 -> 1<=0? false. \n            So freeway1 at T=29: the car does not cover 0.\n\n        Therefore, freeway1 is only dangerous at T=28? and we are not on freeway1 at T=28.\n\n        Freeway3: same as freeway2? because the cars are identical: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12) -> both safe for T>=28.\n\n        Freeway4: (12,47,left,36) -> \n            Condition for left-moving: [h-36*(T-28), τ-36*(T-28)] covers 0?\n            -> 12 - 36*(T-28) <= 0 <= 47 - 36*(T-28)\n\n            Left: 12 - 36*(T-28) <=0 -> -36*(T-28)<=-12 -> 36*(T-28)>=12 -> T-28>=12/36=1/3 -> T>=28.33 -> so T>=29 (since T is integer) is required for the left inequality.\n\n            Right: 0<=47-36*(T-28) -> 36*(T-28)<=47 -> T-28<=47/36≈1.305 -> T<=29.305 -> so T=29.\n\n            Therefore, only at T=29, the car covers 0.\n\n        Freeway5: same as freeway4? -> also only dangerous at T=29.\n\n        Freeway6: (-42,-53,right,6) -> \n            Condition: τ + 6*(T-28) <=0<= h + 6*(T-28) -> \n            Here, τ=-53, h=-42, s=6.\n            Left: -53+6*(T-28)<=0 -> 6*(T-28)<=53 -> T-28<=53/6≈8.83 -> T<=36.83 -> so T from 28 to 36.\n            Right: 0<=-42+6*(T-28) -> 42<=6*(T-28) -> T-28>=7 -> T>=35.\n            So the car covers 0 for T in [35,36] (integer T: T=35,36).\n\n        Freeway7: two cars.\n            First car: (52,41,right,4) -> \n                τ=41, h=52, s=4.\n                Condition: 41+4*(T-28)<=0<=52+4*(T-28)\n                Left: 41+4*(T-28)<=0 -> 4*(T-28)<=-41 -> T-28<=-10.25 -> T<=17.75 -> not for T>=28.\n                So safe.\n\n            Second car: (4,-7,right,4) -> \n                τ=-7, h=4, s=4.\n                Condition: -7+4*(T-28)<=0<=4+4*(T-28)\n                Right: 0<=4+4*(T-28) -> always true for T>=28.\n                Left: -7+4*(T-28)<=0 -> 4*(T-28)<=7 -> T-28<=7/4=1.75 -> T<=29.75 -> so T=28,29.\n\n        Therefore, freeway7 is dangerous at T=28 and T=29.\n\n        Freeway8: (-45,-56,right,3) -> \n            τ=-56, h=-45, s=3.\n            Condition: -56+3*(T-28)<=0<=-45+3*(T-28)\n            Left: -56+3*(T-28)<=0 -> 3*(T-28)<=56 -> T-28<=56/3≈18.666 -> T<=46.666 -> so T from 28 to 46.\n            Right: 0<=-45+3*(T-28) -> 45<=3*(T-28) -> T-28>=15 -> T>=43.\n            So the car covers 0 for T in [43,46] (integers: 43,44,45,46).\n\n        Summary by freeway and time:\n\n          Freeway1: only T=28 (but we are not on freeway1 at T=28, since we start at y=0) -> then if we are on freeway1 at T=28, we collide? but we are not. So freeway1 is safe for T>=28? Actually, we are at freeway1 only when y=1. And at T=28 we are at y=0. So at T=28, we don't check freeway1. Then freeway1 is safe for all T>=28? Because the car only covered 0 at T=28 and then moves away.\n\n          Freeway2: safe at all T>=28.\n          Freeway3: safe at all T>=28.\n          Freeway4: dangerous at T=29.\n          Freeway5: dangerous at T=29.\n          Freeway6: dangerous at T=35,36.\n          Freeway7: dangerous at T=28,29.\n          Freeway8: dangerous at T=43,44,45,46.\n\n        Now, we want to go from y=0 (at T=28) to y=9 (as soon as possible) with minimal H (so minimal turns after the start).\n\n        The minimal H is at least 9 (if we go up every turn: 0->1->2->...->9 in 9 moves). Then we would be at y=9 at turn 28+9 = 37.\n\n        But we must avoid being on freeways 1..8 at dangerous times.\n\n        Let's check the minimal path: we need to go from 0 to 9 in 9 moves (if we don't wait). The moves would be:\n\n          T=28: at y=0 -> safe (not a freeway). Action: U -> then at T=29, we are at y=1.\n          T=29: at y=1 -> freeway1? but we just saw freeway1 is safe at T=29? (because the car only covered at T=28 and then moved away) -> but wait, we didn't compute freeway1 beyond T=28. \n\n          Actually, for freeway1: \n             Car: (0,-47,right,48) at T=29: \n                 right-moving: [τ + s*(T-28), h + s*(T-28)] = [-47+48, 0+48] = [1,48] -> 0 is not in [1,48] -> safe.\n\n          So at T=29, freeway1 is safe.\n\n          Then we move up: at T=30, we are at y=2.\n\n          T=30: freeway2 -> we saw freeway2 is safe at all times.\n\n          Then T=31: y=3 -> freeway3: safe.\n\n          T=32: y=4 -> freeway4: dangerous at T=29? but T=32 is safe? \n                 For freeway4: the car (12,47,left,36) at T=32:\n                    [12-36*(32-28), 47-36*(32-28)] = [12-36*4, 47-36*4] = [12-144, 47-144] = [-132, -97] -> does not cover 0 -> safe.\n\n          T=33: y=5 -> freeway5: similarly, car at T=33: [12-36*5, 47-36*5] = [12-180,47-180]=[-168,-133] -> safe.\n\n          T=34: y=6 -> freeway6: dangerous at T=35,36 -> at T=34: \n                 freeway6 car: (-42,-53,right,6) at T=34:\n                    [-53+6*(34-28), -42+6*(34-28)] = [-53+6*6, -42+36] = [-53+36, -6] = [-17,-6] -> 0 is not in this interval? -> safe.\n\n          T=35: y=6: we are still at y=6? Actually, we moved up to y=6 at T=34, then at T=35 we move to y=7? But if we stay at y=6 at T=35, then we are on freeway6 at T=35: which is dangerous.\n\n          How did we get to y=6? \n            T=34: at y=6 -> then we take an action at T=34 to move to y=7 at T=35? Then at T=35 we are at y=7 -> freeway7.\n\n          Let me recount:\n\n            T=28: y=0 -> action U -> T=29: y=1\n            T=29: y=1 -> action U -> T=30: y=2\n            T=30: y=2 -> action U -> T=31: y=3\n            T=31: y=3 -> action U -> T=32: y=4\n            T=32: y=4 -> action U -> T=33: y=5\n            T=33: y=5 -> action U -> T=34: y=6\n            T=34: y=6 -> action U -> T=35: y=7\n\n          So at T=35, we are at y=7.\n\n          Freeway7: dangerous at T=28,29 -> safe at T=35? \n                 The second car: (4,-7,right,4) at T=35: \n                    [-7+4*(35-28), 4+4*(35-28)] = [-7+28, 4+28] = [21,32] -> does not cover 0 -> safe.\n\n          Then T=36: y=8 -> freeway8: dangerous at T=43,44,45,46 -> safe at T=36? \n                 freeway8 car: (-45,-56,right,3) at T=36:\n                    [-56+3*(36-28), -45+3*8] = [-56+24, -45+24] = [-32, -21] -> safe.\n\n          Then T=37: y=9 -> done.\n\n          So total actions: from T=28 to T=36 (inclusive) -> 9 actions? \n            Actions: \n              T=28: U\n              T=29: U\n              T=30: U\n              T=31: U\n              T=32: U\n              T=33: U\n              T=34: U\n              T=35: U\n              T=36: U -> then at T=37 we are at y=9.\n\n          But wait: we are at T=28: start at y=0. After 9 actions (at T=36) we take the last U and then at T=37 we are at y=9.\n\n          However, we must avoid collisions at T=28 to T=36.\n\n          We checked:\n\n            T=28: y=0 -> safe.\n            T=29: y=1 -> freeway1: safe.\n            T=30: y=2 -> freeway2: safe.\n            T=31: y=3 -> freeway3: safe.\n            T=32: y=4 -> freeway4: safe (car at [-132, -97]).\n            T=33: y=5 -> freeway5: safe (car at [-168, -133]).\n            T=34: y=6 -> freeway6: safe (car at [-17,-6]? but note: freeway6 car at T=34: \n                    [-53+6*(34-28), -42+6*6] = [-53+36, -42+36] = [-17, -6] -> 0 is not in [-17,-6] -> safe.\n            T=35: y=7 -> freeway7: safe (car at [21,32] for the second car, and the first car was safe) -> safe.\n            T=36: y=8 -> freeway8: safe (car at [-32,-21]).\n\n          So the path is safe.\n\n          Therefore, minimal H is 9.\n\n        But wait: what about freeway7 at T=28 and T=29? We were not on freeway7 at those times. We were at y=1 at T=29, which is freeway1, not freeway7.\n\n        So the sequence:\n\n          Turn 28: U\n          Turn 29: U\n          Turn 30: U\n          Turn 31: U\n          Turn 32: U\n          Turn 33: U\n          Turn 34: U\n          Turn 35: U\n          Turn 36: U\n\n        Then at turn 37 we are at y=9.\n\n        But the problem says we are to output the actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1, so H=9 actions: turns 28 to 36.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence. We found H=9.\n\n        But is there a shorter path? The minimal is 9 because we need to move up 9 times. So this is minimal.\n\n        But wait: what if we move up faster? We can only move one step per turn. So 9 is minimal.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n          Turn 28: U\n          Turn 29: U\n          Turn 30: U\n          Turn 31: U\n          Turn 32: U\n          Turn 33: U\n          Turn 34: U\n          Turn 35: U\n          Turn 36: U\n\n        However, note: at T=36 we are at y=8, and we move up to y=9 at T=37. But we don't output the action for T=37? because we only output 9 actions (H=9) and the last action is at T=36.\n\n        And at T=36 we are at freeway8? But we checked freeway8 at T=36 is safe.\n\n        But note: at T=36, we are at y=8 and then we take action U to go to y=9. So we are at freeway8 at T=36 -> and we checked it is safe.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n          Turn 28: U\n          Turn 29: U\n          Turn 30: U\n          Turn 31: U\n          Turn 32: U\n          Turn 33: U\n          Turn 34: U\n          Turn 35: U\n          Turn 36: U\n\n        But wait: what about freeway4 and freeway5 at T=29? They are dangerous at T=29. But at T=29, we are at freeway1 (y=1), not freeway4 or freeway5. So we are safe.\n\n        So we are confident.\n\n        However, let me double-check freeway1 at T=29: \n          Car: (0, -47, right, 48) at T=29: \n              [τ + s*(29-28), h + s*(29-28)] = [-47+48, 0+48] = [1,48] -> does not cover 0? -> safe.\n\n        And freeway7 at T=28 and T=29: we are at y=0 and y=1 respectively, not freeway7.\n\n        So the path is safe.\n\n        But note: what if we try to go faster? We cannot.\n\n        However, what if we start by staying? Then we might avoid freeway4 and freeway5 at T=29? But we don't need to because we are not on those freeways.\n\n        Therefore, we output the above.\n\n        But the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=9.\n\n        However, let me check if we can do it in 9 without going through freeway6 at T=34 and freeway8 at T=36? We already saw they are safe.\n\n        But note: freeway6 is dangerous at T=35 and T=36. In our plan, at T=35 we are at freeway7, not freeway6. And at T=36 we are at freeway8, not freeway6. So we avoid freeway6 at T=35 and T=36.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\n}\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"current turn is t1\" and we output the actions for turns starting at t1. And we have 9 actions.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence of H actions. We have H=9.\n\n        But let me see: we start at turn 28 at y=0. After 9 actions, we are at turn 37 at y=9. And we avoided collisions at turns 28 to 36.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, I just noticed: the freeway6 car is dangerous at T=35 and T=36. But in our plan, at T=35 we are at y=7 (freeway7) and at T=36 we are at y=8 (freeway8). We are not on freeway6 at T=35 or T=36. So we are safe.\n\n        But what if we had stayed at freeway6 at T=35? Then we would collide. But we didn't.\n\n        Therefore, we are safe.\n\n        Final answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 28\\) is 9.

So at turn T, I'm on row y_T, and I choose an action that changes y or stays, but y_{T+1} is determined after the action.\n\nLet me read the update:\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, based on action at t.\n\nAnd collision at turn T if for any car on freeway y_T, 0 ∈ Span(T).\n\nSpan(T) is the car's position at turn T.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, I'm on y_T, and after action, I move to y_{T+1}, so at turn T, I only care about cars on row y_T.\n\nIf I stay or move, at turn T, I'm on row y_T.\n\nNow, the cars: for each freeway, there are cars with head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nDirection: left-moving or right-moving.\n\nIn the car state table, it says \"direction d\", and in the update, left-moving has head and tail, and span decreases or increases.\n\nLet's see the notation.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince it's left-moving, it's moving to decreasing x, so head and tail both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h], I think? In the table it says (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s), but in the update for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h]? No.\n\nLook:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but in the update, for right-moving, it uses [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end? I need to interpret the head and tail.\n\nIn the car state, for each car, it's listed as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nBut in the update:\n\nFor left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ], which might be [min, max] or [max, min]? [h, τ] could be from h to τ, but if left-moving, h might be larger or smaller.\n\nI think I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n\nAssume x-axis, left is decreasing, right is increasing.\n\nFor a left-moving car, it moves to decreasing x, so at time t_1, if head is at h, tail at τ, and it's moving left, so head is at higher x, tail at lower x? Head might be the front.\n\nIn the update for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if it's moving left, h and τ both decrease, so [h, τ] must be such that h > τ or h < τ? If it's an interval, it should be [min, max].\n\nBut [h, τ] is written, which might not be ordered.\n\nFor example, in freeway 1: (48, 1, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h]? From the update.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving car: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] and it becomes [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nSince it's moving left, if h and τ are coordinates, and car is moving left, to have the span move left, if [h, τ] is the interval at t_1, then after ΔT, it should be [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so it decreases, so if s>0, it moves left.\n\nBut for this to be a proper interval, we need to know if h or τ is left/right.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSo for right-moving, [τ, h] at t_1, and τ + sΔT, h + sΔT at T.\n\nSince moving right, both increase.\n\nNow, in the notation [τ, h], it might be that τ is the left end, h is the right end for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ], h might be the right end, τ the left end? Not necessarily, because in the left-moving case, [h, τ] at t_1, and after moving left, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if at t_1, h is the right end, τ left end, then after moving left, h - sΔT < h, τ - sΔT < τ, so the interval shifts left, which is correct.\n\nBut in the notation, it's not specified which is min or max.\n\nFor collision, we care about whether 0 is in the interval, so we need the min and max of the span at time T.\n\nFor a car, at time T, the span is an interval [x_min(T), x_max(T)].\n\nFor left-moving car: at t_1, [x_min(t_1), x_max(t_1)] = [τ, h] or [h, τ]? From above, for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], so let's say [left, right] or [min, max].\n\nTo avoid confusion, I should compute the position at time T relative to t_1.\n\nLet ΔT = T - t_1\n\nFor a car on freeway k:\n\nAt time T, the span is:\n\nIf direction left: [h - s ΔT, τ - s ΔT]\n\nIf direction right: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT]\n\nAnd for collision, at turn T, if I am on row k, and 0 is in [x_min(T), x_max(T)] for that car.\n\nIn the car state, for each freeway, there might be multiple cars, so I need to check all cars on that row.\n\nNow, t_1 = 29, current turn.\n\nPlayer at (0,1)\n\nI need to reach (0,9)\n\nEach action U, D, S changes y by +1, -1, 0, but y must stay in [0,9], so from y=1, D would go to 0, but 0 is not a freeway, I think freeways are y=1 to 8, and y=0 and y=9 are safe? The goal is (0,9), and y=9 has no cars, I assume.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8 with cars, y=0 and y=9 are the bottom and top, no cars.\n\nFrom the vertical axis y=0,1,...,9, and freeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nAt y=0 and y=9, no cars, so no collision possible.\n\nBut at y=0, if I go down from y=1, I go to y=0, which is safe, but I need to go to y=9.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 is the goal.\n\nNow, actions: U: up, y+1, D: down, y-1, S: stay, y same.\n\nBut y must be in 0 to 9, so from y=0, I can only go U or S, not D; from y=9, only D or S, not U, but since we're going to 9, once at 9, we stop.\n\nThe sequence should get to y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal H, so shortest path, but avoiding collisions, which depend on the turns.\n\nSince cars move, the safe times to be on each row depend on when no car is at x=0.\n\nFor each freeway row, I need to find times when it is safe to be there, i.e., no car has 0 in its span.\n\nThen I can plan a path from y=1 to y=9, moving one row at a time, with the constraint that when I am on a row, it must be safe at that turn.\n\nSince I can move up, down, or stay, I might stay on a row for multiple turns, but to minimize H, I probably want to move up as fast as possible, but I might need to wait for safe times.\n\nI can also move down to y=0 to wait, but that might take extra turns, so it might not be efficient.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each row.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (48, 1, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so at time T, span: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [1 + 48 ΔT, 48 + 48 ΔT]\n\nSince direction right, [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT], and τ=1, h=48, s=48.\n\nΔT = T - t_1 = T - 29\n\nSo for freeway 1, at time T, car span: [1 + 48(ΔT), 48 + 48(ΔT)] = [1 + 48ΔT, 48 + 48ΔT]\n\nThis car is on row 1, so when I am on row 1 at time T, I collide if 0 is in [1 + 48ΔT, 48 + 48ΔT]\n\nSince the interval is [1 + 48ΔT, 48 + 48ΔT], both ends are positive and large for ΔT >=0, since at ΔT=0, [1,48], all positive, so 0 is never in this interval because min is at least 1 >0. So for all T, this car never has 0 in span, so row 1 is always safe? But let's see.\n\n1 + 48ΔT >=1 >0 for all ΔT >=0, so x_min >=1 >0, so 0 not in span. Yes, so on row 1, no collision possible from this car. And only one car, so row 1 is always safe to be on.\n\nBut the player starts at y=1 at t=29, so at turn 29, on row 1, and it's safe.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: direction right, τ=-48? Head h, tail τ, so (h, τ, d, s) = (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFor right-moving, span at T: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-59 + 12 ΔT, -48 + 12 ΔT]\n\nSecond car: (24, 13, right, 12), so [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [13 + 12 ΔT, 24 + 12 ΔT]\n\nNow, for row 2, at time T, I collide if for either car, 0 is in their span.\n\nFirst car: 0 in [-59 + 12 ΔT, -48 + 12 ΔT]?\n\nSet -59 + 12 ΔT <= 0 <= -48 + 12 ΔT\n\nBut -59 + 12 ΔT <=0 implies 12 ΔT <=59, ΔT <= 59/12 = 4.916, so ΔT <=4 since integer? Turns are discrete, I assume ΔT integer.\n\nT is turn number, so ΔT = T - 29 is integer, T >=29.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -48 + 12 ΔT implies 48 <= 12 ΔT, ΔT >= 48/12 =4\n\nSo for first car, 0 in span when ΔT >=4 and ΔT <=4 (since ΔT <=4.916, so ΔT=4)\n\nΔT <=4 from left, ΔT >=4 from right, so only at ΔT=4.\n\n-59 + 12 ΔT <=0 <= -48 + 12 ΔT\n\nLeft: -59 +12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=59 => ΔT <= 59/12 ≈4.916, so since ΔT integer, ΔT <=4\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 +12ΔT => 48 <=12ΔT => ΔT >=4\n\nSo both: ΔT >=4 and ΔT <=4, so only at ΔT=4.\n\nAt ΔT=4, -59 +12*4 = -59+48= -11, and -48+48=0, so [ -11, 0], so 0 is included, yes collision.\n\nFor other ΔT, not.\n\nSecond car: [13 +12ΔT, 24+12ΔT], min=13+12ΔT >=13>0, so never contains 0.\n\nSo on row 2, unsafe only when ΔT=4, i.e., T=29+4=33.\n\nAt T=33, unsafe, other times safe.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Cars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nIdentical to row 2, so same: unsafe only at T=33.\n\nNow freeway 4: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, span at T: [h - s ΔT, τ - s ΔT] = [-24 - 36 ΔT, 11 - 36 ΔT]\n\nh and τ: given (head h, tail τ) = (-24, 11), direction left.\n\nIn left-moving, span at t_1: [h, τ] = [-24, 11]? But this interval from -24 to 11, min=-24, max=11.\n\nThen at T: [h - s ΔT, τ - s ΔT] = [-24 -36 ΔT, 11 -36 ΔT]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-24 -36ΔT, 11 -36ΔT]\n\nSet -24 -36ΔT <= 0 <= 11 -36ΔT\n\nLeft: -24 -36ΔT <=0 => -36ΔT <=24 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality: 36ΔT >= -24, which is always true since ΔT>=0.\n\nBetter: -24 -36ΔT <=0 => -36ΔT <=24 => divide by -36, reverse: ΔT >= 24/(-36) = -2/3, which is always true for ΔT>=0.\n\nRight: 0 <= 11 -36ΔT => 36ΔT <=11 => ΔT <= 11/36 ≈0.305, so ΔT <=0 since integer? ΔT integer >=0.\n\nΔT <=0.305, so ΔT=0.\n\nAt ΔT=0, span at T=t_1: [-24,11], which includes 0, since -24<=0<=11.\n\nAt ΔT=1, [-24-36,11-36] = [-60,-25], min=-60<0, max=-25<0, 0 not in.\n\nAt ΔT=0, 0 is in [-24,11], yes.\n\nSo unsafe only at ΔT=0, T=29.\n\nBut T=29 is current turn, and I am not on row 4, I am on row 1.\n\nFor future, at T>29, ΔT>=1, span min <= -60 <0, max <= -25<0, so 0 not in, so row 4 is always safe for T>29.\n\nAt T=29, if I were on row 4, it would be unsafe, but I'm not.\n\nNow freeway 5: same as 4? Cars: (-24, 11, left, 36) same as row 4, so identical, unsafe only at T=29, safe for T>29.\n\nNow freeway 6: (-36, -47, right, 6)\n\nDirection right, so span at T: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-47 + 6 ΔT, -36 + 6 ΔT]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-47 +6ΔT, -36 +6ΔT]\n\nSet -47 +6ΔT <=0 <= -36 +6ΔT\n\nLeft: -47 +6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=47 => ΔT <= 47/6 ≈7.833, so ΔT <=7\n\nRight: 0 <= -36 +6ΔT => 36 <=6ΔT => ΔT >=6\n\nSo both: ΔT >=6 and ΔT <=7\n\nAt ΔT=6: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0], includes 0\n\nΔT=7: [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6], includes 0? -5<=0<=6, yes.\n\nΔT=8: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], min=1>0, not include 0.\n\nSo unsafe at ΔT=6 and 7, T=35 and 36.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars: (56, 45, right, 4) and (8, -3, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: (h,τ,d,s) = (56,45,right,4)? But for right-moving, span [τ +sΔT, h +sΔT] = [45 +4ΔT, 56 +4ΔT], min=45+4ΔT >=45>0, so never contains 0.\n\nSecond car: (8, -3, right, 4), so [τ +sΔT, h +sΔT] = [-3 +4ΔT, 8 +4ΔT]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-3 +4ΔT, 8 +4ΔT]\n\n-3 +4ΔT <=0 <= 8 +4ΔT\n\nLeft: -3 +4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=3 => ΔT <= 3/4=0.75, so ΔT <=0\n\nRight: 0 <=8 +4ΔT always true for ΔT>=0.\n\nSo only at ΔT=0: [-3,8], includes 0.\n\nAt ΔT=1: [1,12], not include.\n\nSo unsafe only at ΔT=0, T=29.\n\nBut again, not on row 7 now.\n\nSafe for T>29.\n\nNow freeway 8: (-42, -53, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, span [τ +sΔT, h +sΔT] = [-53 +3ΔT, -42 +3ΔT]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-53 +3ΔT, -42 +3ΔT]\n\n-53 +3ΔT <=0 <= -42 +3ΔT\n\nLeft: -53 +3ΔT <=0 => 3ΔT <=53 => ΔT <=53/3≈17.666, ΔT<=17\n\nRight: 0 <= -42 +3ΔT => 42 <=3ΔT => ΔT >=14\n\nSo both: ΔT >=14 and ΔT <=17\n\nAt ΔT=14: [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0], includes 0\n\nΔT=15: [-53+45, -42+45] = [-8,3], includes 0\n\nΔT=16: [-53+48, -42+48] = [-5,6], includes 0\n\nΔT=17: [-53+51, -42+51] = [-2,9], includes 0\n\nΔT=18: [-53+54, -42+54] = [1,12], not include\n\nSo unsafe for ΔT=14 to 17, T=43 to 46.\n\nNow, summarize for each row, unsafe times (T):\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=33 (ΔT=4)\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=33 (same as y=2)\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=29, safe after\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=29, safe after\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=35 and 36 (ΔT=6,7)\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=29, safe after\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=43 to 46 (ΔT=14 to 17)\n\nPlayer starts at t=29, y=1.\n\nGoal: reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, it's always safe.\n\nTo minimize turns, I want to go up as fast as possible, but need to avoid unsafe times on the rows.\n\nI can move up, down, or stay.\n\nFrom y=1, I can go up to y=2, or down to y=0, or stay.\n\ny=0 is safe, but it doesn't progress, so probably not useful unless I need to wait.\n\nSimilarly, staying on a row might be needed if the next row is unsafe.\n\nBut in this case, since I need to go to y=9, and from y=1 to y=9, I need to cover 8 rows, but I can move multiple steps per turn? No, each action changes y by at most 1, so minimum turns to go from y=1 to y=9 is 8 actions (all U), but I might need to wait or detour if unsafe.\n\nBut in this case, let's see the unsafe times.\n\nStart at t=29, y=1.\n\ny=1 is always safe, so I can stay or move.\n\nI want to go up.\n\nNext row y=2, unsafe only at t=33.\n\nt=33 is future.\n\nAt t=29, I can go up to y=2 immediately, or wait.\n\nIf I go up at t=29 to y=2, what turn?\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, perform action, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nAt t=29, I am at y=1.\n\nI choose action a_{29}, which affects y_{30}.\n\nIf a_{29} = U, then y_{30} = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nThen at turn t=30, I am at y=2.\n\nSimilarly, if S, y_{30}=1, etc.\n\nNow, for collision: at turn T, I am on row y_T, and check cars on that row.\n\nSo at turn T, position y_T.\n\nWhen I arrive at a row.\n\nFor example, if at t=29, I do U, then at t=30, I am on y=2.\n\ny=2 is unsafe only at t=33, so at t=30, it is safe (since t=30, ΔT=1 for t_1=29, T=30, ΔT=1, for row 2, unsafe at ΔT=4, T=33, so at T=30, safe).\n\nSimilarly, I can go to y=3 at t=31, etc.\n\nBut let's plan the path.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nThe critical points are the unsafe times.\n\nList the unsafe times per row:\n\ny=1: never unsafe\n\ny=2: unsafe at t=33\n\ny=3: unsafe at t=33 (same)\n\ny=4: unsafe at t=29, safe after\n\ny=5: unsafe at t=29, safe after\n\ny=6: unsafe at t=35,36\n\ny=7: unsafe at t=29, safe after\n\ny=8: unsafe at t=43,44,45,46\n\nt=43 is ΔT=14, etc.\n\nNow, to go from y=1 to y=9, minimum steps: 8 ups, but I need to be at each row at a safe time.\n\nSince I start at y=1, t=29.\n\nI can go up immediately.\n\nt=29: at y=1, safe.\n\nAction: U, then t=30 at y=2.\n\ny=2 at t=30: safe, since unsafe only at t=33.\n\nThen from y=2, I can go U to y=3 at t=31.\n\ny=3 at t=31: safe, unsafe only t=33.\n\nThen to y=4 at t=32.\n\ny=4 at t=32: safe, since unsafe only t=29, and t=32>29.\n\nSimilarly, to y=5 at t=33.\n\ny=5 at t=33: is it safe?\n\ny=5 unsafe at t=29, but t=33>29, so safe.\n\nUnsafe only at t=29, so at t=33, safe.\n\nThen to y=6 at t=34.\n\ny=6 at t=34: unsafe times t=35,36, so t=34 safe.\n\nThen to y=7 at t=35.\n\ny=7 at t=35: unsafe only at t=29, so safe at t=35.\n\nBut y=6 is unsafe at t=35 and 36.\n\nAt t=35, if I am on y=7, that's fine, but I need to be on y=6 before.\n\nLet's trace:\n\nt=34: at y=6?

Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=29 to t=29 + H - 1, and after H actions, at turn t=29 + H, position y=9.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nTurn t_1 = 29, initial position.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1 + 1, position y_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nAnd the sequence is actions at t from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nIn the answer format: actions for turn t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to H actions? Let's see.\n\n\"sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at time t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter these H actions, at time t_1 + H, position is 9.\n\nIn this case, with H=8 actions: all U from t=29 to t=36.\n\nActions:\n\nt=29: U, to y=2 at t=30\n\nt=30: U, to y=3 at t=31\n\nt=31: U, to y=4 at t=32\n\nt=32: U, to y=5 at t=33\n\nt=33: U, to y=6 at t=34\n\nt=34: U, to y=7 at t=35\n\nt=35: U, to y=8 at t=36\n\nt=36: U, to y=9 at t=37\n\nNow, positions:\n\nAt turn t=29: y=1 (start)\n\nAfter a29=U, at t=30: y=2\n\nAt t=30: on row y=2, safe? t=30, ΔT=1 for row 2, unsafe at ΔT=4, t=33, so t=30 safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=31: y=3, safe\n\nt=32: y=4, safe\n\nt=33: y=5, safe\n\nt=34: y=6, safe (t=34, ΔT=5 for row 6? t=34, t_1=29, ΔT=5, row 6 unsafe at ΔT=6 and 7, t=35,36, so t=34 safe)\n\nt=35: y=7, safe\n\nt=36: y=8, safe\n\nt=37: y=9, goal.\n\nBut at t=36, I am on y=8, which is safe, and I do U, to y=9 at t=37.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=29 to t=36, that's 8 actions.\n\nH=8, and at t_1 + H = 29 + 8 = 37, y=9.\n\nBut is there a problem at y=6?\n\ny=6 is unsafe at t=35 and 36.\n\nIn this path, I am on y=6 only at t=34, which is safe.\n\nAt t=35, I am on y=7, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly, t=36 on y=8.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut what about row 8? It has unsafe times later, but I am at y=8 at t=36, which is before t=43, so safe.\n\nIs there a way to do it faster?\n\nMinimum H: from y=1 to y=9, need 8 moves up, so H=8 is minimum possible, since each U only increases by 1.\n\nCan I do it in less? No, because I start at y=1, need to go to y=9, difference 8, each U increases by 1, so at least 8 actions.\n\nUnless I can skip rows, but no, only change by 1 per action.\n\nSo H=8 is minimum.\n\nIn this case, with all U, it seems to work, no collision.\n\nBut let me confirm the unsafe times again.\n\nFor y=6, unsafe at t=35 and 36.\n\nIn my path, at t=34, y=6, safe.\n\nt=35, y=7, not on y=6.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\ny=2 and y=3 unsafe at t=33, but I am on y=2 at t=30, y=3 at t=31, both before t=33.\n\ny=5 at t=33, but y=5 unsafe only at t=29, so at t=33 safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut in the action sequence, I need to list the actions.\n\nIn this case, all U from t=29 to t=36.\n\nBut t=36 action U to y=9 at t=37.\n\nThe sequence should be actions for turn t_1 to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nSo for H=8, actions at t=29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36.\n\nAll U.\n\nBut is there any need to change?\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but no.\n\nMaybe I can go down to avoid something, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: at t=33, y=5, but y=2 and y=3 are unsafe at t=33, but I am not on them.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if staying or down is needed, but in this case, not.\n\nBut let me check row 8 later, but I am not there at unsafe times.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier? But H=8 is min.\n\nStart at t=29 y=1, after 8 U, at t=37 y=9.\n\nt=37 is the turn when I reach y=9.\n\nThe first action is at t=29.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be fine.\n\nBut in the car state, for row 7, there was a car unsafe at t=29, but I am not on row 7 at t=29, I am on row 1.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nBut the problem is to output the actions.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let me see if I can do it with H=7? Impossible, since y from 1 to 9, need 8 steps.\n\nUnless I start from y=1, after 7 U, y=8, need one more to y=9.\n\nBut y=9 not reached in 7 actions.\n\nAfter k actions, y = 1 + number of U minus number of D, but since we go up, no D, so after H actions, y=1 + U_count - D_count.\n\nTo reach y=9, 1 + net_up =9, so net_up=8, so minimum H=8 with all U.\n\nIf I use D, it takes more turns, so worse.\n\nSo H=8 is min.\n\nAnd with all U, it works.\n\nBut in my earlier, at t=33, I am going to y=5, but row 2 and 3 are unsafe at t=33, but since I am on y=5, not affected.\n\nOnly the row I am on matters.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nBut let me list the turns and positions:\n\nTurn T | y_T | safe?\n\nT=29: y=1, safe\n\nAction U\n\nT=30: y=2, safe (unsafe at T=33 only)\n\nAction U\n\nT=31: y=3, safe\n\nAction U\n\nT=32: y=4, safe\n\nAction U\n\nT=33: y=5, safe (unsafe only at T=29)\n\nAction U\n\nT=34: y=6, safe (unsafe at T=35,36)\n\nAction U\n\nT=35: y=7, safe\n\nAction U\n\nT=36: y=8, safe (unsafe from T=43)\n\nAction U\n\nT=37: y=9, goal.\n\nAll safe.\n\nPerhaps I can start later, but that increases H, not minimal.\n\nOr if I stay somewhere, H larger.\n\nSo this should be minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t=29 to t=36: all U.\n\nBut let me confirm if at t=34, y=6 is safe.\n\nt=34, t_1=29, ΔT=5.\n\nRow y=6: car span [-47 +6ΔT, -36 +6ΔT] = [-47+30, -36+30] = [-17,-6], min=-17<0, max=-6<0, so 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt t=35, if I were on y=6, [-47+35*6? ΔT=6, T=35, t_1=29, ΔT=6, [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], includes 0, unsafe.\n\nBut I am on y=7 at t=35.\n\nSimilarly, y=7: at t=35, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nNow, the answer should be actions at each turn.\n\nt_1 = 29.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nAfter that, at turn 37, y=9.\n\nH=8.\n\nBut in the sequence, it's from t=29 to t=36, that's 8 actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me see if I need to include the turn numbers.\n\nIn the answer format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for this case.\n\nBut the car state had row 4,5,7 unsafe at t=29, but I didn't go there at t=29.\n\nAnother thing: row 8 has unsafe times, but I am there at t=36, before t=43.\n\nt=36 ΔT=7, row 8: car span [-53 +3*7, -42 +3*7] = [-53+21, -42+21] = [-32,-21], not include 0, safe.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster by moving down to y=0 and up, but that would take more turns, since from y=0 to y=9, 9 steps, worse.\n\nOr staying, same.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 8 with all U.\n\nBut in the output, I need to write the sequence.\n\nBut let me make sure about the direction or something.\n\nFor row 2 and 3, at t=33 unsafe, but I avoid.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if at some point I need to wait, but not here.\n\nAnother row: row 1 is safe, but I start there.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the answer format says \"a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\", so t from 0 to 7 for H=8.\n\nBut in text, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I should write it as:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 29: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 30: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: U \\end{array} }\n\nSince t_1=29, but in the action, it's for the turn number.\n\nI think it's clear.\n\nBut in the sequence, the last action is at t=36, which is t_1 + 7, since t_1=29, t_1+7=36.\n\nt from 0 to 7: t_1 + t for t=0:29, t=1:30, ..., t=7:36.\n\nActions all U.\n\nSo H=8.\n\nBut is there a problem with row 6? No.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at an earlier turn? But t=37 is after 8 actions, start from t=29.\n\nIf I could start moving faster, but no.\n\nUnless I do something else, but I think not.\n\nSo this should be the answer.\n\nBut let me see the car state again.\n\nFor freeway 7, there is a car (8,-3,right,4) which is unsafe at t=29, but I am not on it.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps for row 4, at t=29 unsafe, but I go there at t=32, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 29\\) is 8. The sequence of actions consists entirely of \"U\" (up) moves, as this direct upward path avoids all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) and reaches the goal in the minimum possible turns.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Freeway 1**: Always safe, as the car span at any turn \\(T \\geq 29\\) does not include \\(x=0\\).\n- **Freeway 2**: Unsafe only at \\(T = 33\\). The player is on row \\(y=2\\) at \\(T=30\\), which is safe.\n- **Freeway 3**: Unsafe only at \\(T = 33\\).

The player is on row \\(y=5\\) at \\(T=33\\), which is safe.\n- **Freeway 6**: Unsafe at \\(T = 35\\) and \\(T = 36\\). The player is on row \\(y=6\\) at \\(T=34\\), which is safe.\n- **Freeway 7**: Unsafe only at \\(T = 29\\). The player is on row \\(y=7\\) at \\(T=35\\), which is safe.\n- **Freeway 8**: Unsafe from \\(T = 43\\) to \\(T = 46\\). The player is on row \\(y=8\\) at \\(T=36\\), which is safe.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions are applied from turn \\(t_1 = 29\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 29 + 8 - 1 = 36\\). After the last action at turn 36, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 37.\n\n- At turn 29: Action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 2)\\) at turn 30.\n- At turn 30: Action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 31.\n- At turn 31: Action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 4)\\) at turn 32.\n- At turn 32: Action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 5)\\) at turn 33.\n- At turn 33: Action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 6)\\) at turn 34.\n- At turn 34: Action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 7)\\) at turn 35.\n- At turn 35: Action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 8)\\) at turn 36.\n- At turn 36: Action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 37.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 8\\) turns with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 29: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 30: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t=30.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway from 1 to 8. For each car, I'm given its position at turn t=30: head, tail, direction, and speed. The direction tells me if it's left-moving or right-moving, and the span updates linearly with time based on speed.\n\nCollision happens at turn T if the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. Importantly, when the player moves, they are only on the new freeway starting from the next turn. So if I move to y at turn T, I'm on y at turn T, and I check for cars on y at turn T.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\" This means that when you take an action at turn T, it affects your position at turn T+1. Let me read carefully.\n\nFrom the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, based on action a_t. So action a_t at time t determines y_{t+1}. So at time t, you are at y_t, and after action, you move to y_{t+1} for time t+1.\n\nThe collision condition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\" So at turn T, you are at position y_T, and you check if on that freeway y_T, there is a car whose span includes 0 at that exact turn T.\n\nThe note clarifies that when you take an action to move to a different freeway, you are not on that freeway until the next turn. For example, if at turn T you are on y, and you move to y' ≠ y, then at turn T you are still on y, so you only care about cars on y at turn T. At turn T+1, you are on y', so you care about cars on y' at turn T+1.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions from turn 30 onwards to reach y=9 as quickly as possible, starting from y=2.\n\nFirst, I should model the car positions over time for each freeway, since they move with constant speed.\n\nLet me list all cars for each freeway at turn t=30.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: (head=96, tail=49, direction=right, speed=48)\n\nSince direction is right, and head=96, tail=49, but for right-moving, the span is [τ, h], so tail τ=49, head h=96? The notation says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" so τ is tail, h is head. In the input, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), but for right-moving, head should be larger than tail if it's moving right.\n\nLook: for freeway 1: (96, 49, right, 48). Since right-moving, at t=30, span is [τ, h] = [49, 96]? But it says (head, tail), so head=96, tail=49, and direction right, so since moving right, head is the front, so at t=30, position from tail to head is from 49 to 96? But the span is [τ, h] for right-moving, meaning from τ to h, with τ < h since moving right.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\" and since left-moving, h should be left, τ right, so h < τ.\n\nIn the input, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed). I think \"head\" means the front of the car, so for right-moving, head is larger, for left-moving, head is smaller.\n\nFor freeway 1: (head=96, tail=49, dir=right, speed=48). Since right-moving, head=96, tail=49, so at t=30, span is [49,96]? But [τ,h] with τ=tail=49, h=head=96, so [49,96].\n\nThen for future turn T, span is [49 + 48*(T-30), 96 + 48*(T-30)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars: (-36, -47, right, 12) and (36, 25, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head=-36, tail=-47, dir=right, speed=12. Since right-moving, head should be greater than tail? -36 > -47, yes. So at t=30, span [τ,h] = [-47, -36]\n\nThen for T, [-47 + 12*(T-30), -36 + 12*(T-30)]\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,12), span [25,36] at t=30, then [25 + 12*(T-30), 36 + 12*(T-30)] for T.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"3 | (-36, -47, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12) \" identical to freeway 2? Probably a typo or same setup.\n\nBut I think I need to handle each freeway separately.\n\nFreeway 4: (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nDir left, so for left-moving, span is [h, τ] with h head, τ tail. Head=-60, tail=-25, and since left-moving, head should be less than tail? -60 < -25, yes. So at t=30, span [h, τ] = [-60, -25]\n\nThen for T, [ -60 - 36*(T-30), -25 - 36*(T-30) ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as freeway 4? \"5 | (-60, -25, left, 36) \" same as 4.\n\nFreeway 6: (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nHead=-30, tail=-41, dir=right, speed=6. Since right, head > tail, -30 > -41, so span at t=30: [τ,h] = [-41, -30]\n\nThen for T: [-41 + 6*(T-30), -30 + 6*(T-30)]\n\nFreeway 7: (60,49,right,4) and (12,1,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head=60, tail=49, dir=right, speed=4, span at t=30: [49,60]? [τ,h] = [49,60]\n\nThen [49 + 4*(T-30), 60 + 4*(T-30)]\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4), span [1,12] at t=30, then [1 + 4*(T-30), 12 + 4*(T-30)]\n\nFreeway 8: (-39,-50,right,3)\n\nHead=-39, tail=-50, dir=right, speed=3, span at t=30: [τ,h] = [-50, -39]\n\nThen for T: [-50 + 3*(T-30), -39 + 3*(T-30)]\n\nNow, I need to find when each freeway has a car where 0 is in the span, meaning for some car on that freeway, min_span <= 0 <= max_span at that turn.\n\nSince the player is at x=0, and cars are on the freeway, collision if at turn T, on freeway y, there is car with span containing 0.\n\nFor each freeway, I can find the times when it is unsafe, i.e., some car has 0 in span.\n\nThen, for the player to be on freeway y at time T, it must be that at time T, freeway y is safe, meaning no car has 0 in span.\n\ny ranges from 0 to 9, but freeways are only y=1 to 8 for cars. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, no cars? The problem says \"freeways y=1,…,8\" so y=0 and y=9 should be always safe, no cars to collide with.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,2), which is freeway 2? y=2 is a freeway with cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways with cars, so when player is at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible, I think.\n\nThe collision is only with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nSo positions y=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at t=30.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, once I reach it, I can stop.\n\nBut I need to get to y=9, and at that turn, I must be on y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, I should move up as much as possible, but avoid unsafe times on the freeways.\n\nSince I can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, I need to plan a path through the y-levels.\n\nLet me denote the time from t=30 onwards. Let τ = T - 30, so at τ=0, t=30.\n\nI need to find for each freeway y=1 to 8, for each time τ, whether it is safe to be on that freeway at time τ.\n\nThat is, for freeway k, at time τ (relative to t=30), is there no car with 0 in span.\n\nFirst, for each car, find when 0 is in its span.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, span at time τ: [49 + 48τ, 96 + 48τ] since T-30 = τ.\n\n0 is in span if 49 + 48τ <= 0 <= 96 + 48τ\n\nSince 49 + 48τ <= 0 and 0 <= 96 + 48τ.\n\nFirst inequality: 49 + 48τ <= 0 ⇒ 48τ <= -49 ⇒ τ <= -49/48 ≈ -1.0208, but τ >=0, so never true.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 96 + 48τ, which is always true since 96 + 48τ >0 for τ>=0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, 0 is never in the span for τ >=0. So freeway 1 is always safe? Let me confirm.\n\n49 + 48τ <= 0: since τ >=0, 49 + 48τ >=49>0, so 49 + 48τ >0, thus 0 < 49 + 48τ <= ... <= 96 + 48τ, so 0 is less than the lower bound, so 0 not in [49+48τ, 96+48τ] for τ>=0. Yes, so freeway 1 is always safe for τ >=0.\n\nGood.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36, -47, right, 12), span at τ: [ -47 + 12τ, -36 + 12τ ]\n\n0 in span if -47 + 12τ <= 0 <= -36 + 12τ\n\nWhich is -47 + 12τ <= 0 and 0 <= -36 + 12τ\n\nFirst: -47 + 12τ <= 0 ⇒ 12τ <= 47 ⇒ τ <= 47/12 ≈ 3.9167\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 + 12τ ⇒ 12τ >= 36 ⇒ τ >= 3\n\nSo for τ in [3, 3.9167], approximately [3, 47/12]\n\nSince τ integer, τ=3,4? 47/12=3.9167, so τ <=3.9167, so τ=0,1,2,3? τ=3: -47+36= -11 <=0? -47+12*3= -47+36= -11 <=0 yes, and 0 <= -36+36=0, so 0<=0 true, so τ=3 is included.\n\nτ=4: -47+48=1 >0? Lower bound -47+12*4= -47+48=1 >0, so 1 <=0 false? 0 <1, not <=, so 0 not >= lower bound.\n\nUpper bound -36+48=12>0, but lower bound 1>0, so 0 not in [1,12].\n\nSo only for τ=3: at τ=3, span [ -47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0], and 0 is included since it's a closed interval, I assume? The span is inclusive, I think.\n\nSimilarly, τ=4: [ -47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nτ=2: [ -47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nτ=1: [-35,-24], no.\n\nτ=0: [-47,-36], no.\n\nSo first car unsafe only at τ=3.\n\nSecond car on freeway 2: (36,25,right,12), span [25 +12τ, 36 +12τ]\n\n0 in span? 25+12τ <=0 <=36+12τ? But 25+12τ >=25>0 for τ>=0, so 0 < 25+12τ <= ... , so 0 not in span, always safe.\n\nSo for freeway 2, only unsafe at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, t=33, if player is on y=2, collision with first car.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"3 | (-36, -47, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12) \" identical, so same thing: unsafe only at τ=3.\n\nFreeway 4: one car (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nDir left, so span at τ: [h - sτ, τ - sτ]? From update: for left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] with T-t1=τ.\n\nh=-60, τ? tail is -25, but in notation, it's head and tail, but for left-moving, span is [h, τ] at t1, so [ -60, -25 ] at τ=0.\n\nThen at τ, [ -60 - 36τ, -25 - 36τ ]\n\n0 in span if -60 -36τ <= 0 <= -25 -36τ\n\nNow, -60 -36τ <=0 is always true since negative.\n\n0 <= -25 -36τ ⇒ -25 -36τ >=0? 0 <= -25 -36τ means -25 -36τ >=0, so -36τ >=25, τ <= -25/36 ≈ -0.694, but τ>=0, so never true.\n\nThus, 0 is never in span for freeway 4. Always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 same as 4, always safe.\n\nFreeway 6: one car (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nDir right, head=-30, tail=-41, so span at τ: [ -41 +6τ, -30 +6τ ]\n\n0 in span if -41 +6τ <= 0 <= -30 +6τ\n\nFirst: -41 +6τ <=0 ⇒ 6τ <=41 ⇒ τ <=41/6≈6.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -30 +6τ ⇒ 6τ >=30 ⇒ τ >=5\n\nSo τ from 5 to 6.833, integer τ=5,6\n\nτ=5: [ -41+30, -30+30] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nτ=6: [ -41+36, -30+36] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nτ=7: [ -41+42, -30+42] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo unsafe at τ=5 and τ=6.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,4), span [49+4τ, 60+4τ], all >0 for τ>=0, so always safe.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4), span [1+4τ, 12+4τ], all >=1>0, so always safe.\n\nThus freeway 7 always safe.\n\nFreeway 8: one car (-39,-50,right,3)\n\nSpan [ -50 +3τ, -39 +3τ ]\n\n0 in span if -50 +3τ <= 0 <= -39 +3τ\n\nFirst: -50 +3τ <=0 ⇒ 3τ <=50 ⇒ τ <=50/3≈16.666\n\nSecond: 0 <= -39 +3τ ⇒ 3τ >=39 ⇒ τ >=13\n\nSo τ from 13 to 16.666, integer τ=13,14,15,16\n\nτ=13: [ -50+39, -39+39] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nτ=14: [ -50+42, -39+42] = [-8,3], 0 in\n\nτ=15: [ -50+45, -39+45] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nτ=16: [ -50+48, -39+48] = [-2,9], 0 in\n\nτ=17: [ -50+51, -39+51] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo unsafe at τ=13,14,15,16.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, unsafe times (relative to t=30, τ):\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: unsafe at τ=3\n\ny=3: unsafe at τ=3 (same as y=2)\n\ny=4: always safe\n\ny=5: always safe\n\ny=6: unsafe at τ=5,6\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: unsafe at τ=13,14,15,16\n\ny=0 and y=9: always safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at τ=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince I can move up or down, but moving down might not help since I need to go up to 9, and y=0 is safe but away from target.\n\nTo minimize time, I should go up directly if possible.\n\nCurrent y=2, target y=9, difference 7, so minimum turns if I go up every turn: from y=2 to y=9 in 7 turns, arriving at y=9 at τ=7.\n\nBut I need to check if I can be on each intermediate freeway at safe times.\n\nSince I move step by step, I need to ensure that for each position I occupy, at that time, it is safe.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=2: at τ=0, y=2 is safe? From above, y=2 unsafe only at τ=3, so at τ=0, y=2 is safe.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=9 at some τ.\n\nThe earliest possible arrival: if I go up every turn, from y=2 at τ=0, after action U at τ=0, to y=3 at τ=1.\n\nThen U at τ=1 to y=4 at τ=2.\n\nU to y=5 at τ=3.\n\nBut at τ=3, if I am on y=5? Let's see the path.\n\nAt time τ, position y_τ.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=2 (safe, as above)\n\nAction a_0: let's say U, then y_{1} = 3\n\nAt τ=1, y=3: is it safe? y=3 unsafe at τ=3, but τ=1, so should be safe? From above, y=3 unsafe only at τ=3, so at τ=1, safe.\n\nThen action a_1: U, to y=4 at τ=2.\n\ny=4 at τ=2: y=4 is always safe, so ok.\n\nAction a_2: U, to y=5 at τ=3.\n\ny=5 at τ=3: y=5 is always safe, so ok.\n\nAction a_3: U, to y=6 at τ=4.\n\ny=6 at τ=4: y=6 unsafe at τ=5 and 6, but τ=4, so safe? τ=4 not in {5,6}, so safe.\n\nAction a_4: U, to y=7 at τ=5.\n\ny=7 at τ=5: y=7 is always safe, so ok.\n\nAction a_5: U, to y=8 at τ=6.\n\ny=8 at τ=6: y=8 unsafe at τ=13,14,15,16, τ=6 not in, so safe.\n\nAction a_6: U, to y=9 at τ=7.\n\ny=9 at τ=7: y=9 always safe, so ok.\n\nNow, at τ=7, I reach y=9.\n\nBut I need to check if during this path, I am safe at each step.\n\nSpecifically, at each turn, when I am at a position, it must be safe.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nAt τ=0 (t=30): y=2, safe\n\nAfter action U at τ=0, to y=3 at τ=1\n\nAt τ=1: y=3, safe (since unsafe only τ=3)\n\nAfter U at τ=1, to y=4 at τ=2\n\nAt τ=2: y=4, safe\n\nAfter U at τ=2, to y=5 at τ=3\n\nAt τ=3: y=5, safe\n\nAfter U at τ=3, to y=6 at τ=4\n\nAt τ=4: y=6, now y=6 unsafe at τ=5 and 6, τ=4 not, so safe\n\nAfter U at τ=4, to y=7 at τ=5\n\nAt τ=5: y=7, safe (always)\n\nAfter U at τ=5, to y=8 at τ=6\n\nAt τ=6: y=8, unsafe at τ=13-16, τ=6 not, so safe\n\nAfter U at τ=6, to y=9 at τ=7\n\nAt τ=7: y=9, safe\n\nSo all positions at each time are safe.\n\nAnd I reach y=9 at τ=7, which is t=30+7=37.\n\nNow, is this minimal? Since I need to increase y by 7, and I did it in 7 moves, each up, so it should be minimal unless I have to wait, but here I didn't have to wait, so H=7 turns.\n\nBut let me confirm the actions.\n\nAt turn t=30, position y=2.\n\nAction a_{t} at time t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at t=30, I take action a_{30}, which affects y_{31}.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn terms of τ: at τ=0 (t=30), I am at y=2.\n\nI take action a_{30}, which sets y_{31} = y_{30} + Δy based on a_{30}.\n\nThen at τ=1 (t=31), I am at y_{31}, and so on.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nAt τ=0 (t=30): at y=2\n\nTake action U, so y_{31} = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nAt τ=1 (t=31): at y=3\n\nTake action U, y_{32} = 4\n\nAt τ=2 (t=32): at y=4\n\nTake action U, y_{33} = 5\n\nAt τ=3 (t=33): at y=5\n\nTake action U, y_{34} = 6\n\nAt τ=4 (t=34): at y=6\n\nTake action U, y_{35} = 7\n\nAt τ=5 (t=35): at y=7\n\nTake action U, y_{36} = 8\n\nAt τ=6 (t=36): at y=8\n\nTake action U, y_{37} = 9\n\nAt τ=7 (t=37): at y=9, which is the goal.\n\nNow, we need to be at y=9 at some turn, and in this case, at t=37, y=9.\n\nNow, check safety:\n\nAt each point, when I am at y at time t, it must be safe.\n\nAt t=30, y=2: τ=0, safe\n\nt=31, y=3: τ=1, safe (y=3 unsafe only at τ=3)\n\nt=32, y=4: τ=2, always safe\n\nt=33, y=5: τ=3, always safe\n\nt=34, y=6: τ=4, y=6 unsafe at τ=5,6; τ=4 not, so safe\n\nt=35, y=7: τ=5, always safe\n\nt=36, y=8: τ=6, y=8 unsafe at τ=13-16; τ=6 not, so safe\n\nt=37, y=9: safe\n\nAll good.\n\nBut at t=33, y=5, which is safe, but y=2 and y=3 are unsafe at t=33 (τ=3), but I am not on them at that time.\n\nAt t=33, I am on y=5, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, no issues.\n\nSo with 7 actions, I reach in 7 turns.\n\nBut the player position at turn t is given, and actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, and after H actions, I reach at turn t1 + H.\n\nIn this case, start at t=30, after 7 actions: actions at t=30 to t=36, and position at t=37 is y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, so sequence from t=30 to t=30+H-1.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions for turn t1 to t1 + H-1.\n\nHere H=7, so actions from turn 30 to 36.\n\nNow, but I recall that on freeway 6, it is unsafe at τ=5 and 6, which are t=35 and t=36.\n\nIn my path, at τ=4 (t=34), I am on y=6, which is safe, then I move to y=7 at t=35.\n\nAt t=35, I am on y=7, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=36, on y=8.\n\nSo y=6 is occupied at t=34, which is τ=4, safe.\n\nUnsafe at t=35 and t=36, but I am not on y=6 at those times.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8, unsafe at later times, not now.\n\nSo all fine.\n\nBut is there a faster way? To reach in fewer than 7 turns? From y=2 to y=9, minimum 7 up moves, so no, unless I can jump, but I can only change by 1 each turn, so 7 is minimum.\n\nI could go down and up, but that would take more turns, so no benefit.\n\nFor example, if there was a conflict, I might need to wait, but here no need.\n\nBut let me check if at some point I might be forced to wait.\n\nFor instance, at τ=5 and 6, y=6 is unsafe, but in my path, I am not on y=6 at τ=5 or 6; I am on it at τ=4, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 and y=3 unsafe at τ=3, but at τ=3 I am on y=5, not on them.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier? No, because I start at y=2, need to get to y=9, each move up increases by 1, so 7 moves minimum.\n\nUnless I start at t=30, and at t=30 I am at y=2, and I take action immediately.\n\nAfter first action, at t=31, y changes, etc.\n\nEarliest at t=37 to be at y=9.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 earlier if I move faster, but I can't, only +1 per turn.\n\nSo H=7 is minimum.\n\nNow, the actions: from t=30 to t=36, all U.\n\nBut let me write the sequence.\n\nTurn t_1 = 30\n\nAction a_{30} = U\n\nThen y_{31} = 3\n\na_{31} = U\n\ny_{32} = 4\n\na_{32} = U\n\ny_{33} = 5\n\na_{33} = U\n\ny_{34} = 6\n\na_{34} = U\n\ny_{35} = 7\n\na_{35} = U\n\ny_{36} = 8\n\na_{36} = U\n\ny_{37} = 9\n\nReached at t=37.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=30 to t=36, that's 7 actions.\n\nNow, the answer format should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\n}\n\nBut let me double-check if at any point I might have a collision due to the car movement.\n\nFor example, at t=33, which is τ=3, y=2 and y=3 are unsafe.\n\nBut at t=33, I am at y=5, which is fine.\n\nAt t=34, y=6: τ=4, y=6 is safe, as per above.\n\nAt t=35, y=7, safe.\n\nt=36, y=8, safe.\n\nt=37, y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if staying or moving down could help, but it would only increase time, so not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, the action affects the next position, but I think I handled it.\n\nIn the collision note, it says that when you move to a different freeway, you are not considered on it until next turn, which is consistent.\n\nFor example, when I take action U at t=34 from y=6 to y=7, at t=34 I am on y=6, and I check cars on y=6 at t=34, which is safe, then at t=35 I am on y=7, check cars on y=7, safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut in the car list, freeway 2 and 3 are identical, but I didn't need to go to y=3 at τ=3, which is unsafe, but in my path I was at y=3 at τ=1, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nSo minimal H=7, with all up actions.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nThe sequence is actions at turn 30 to 36, all U.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbering.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1=30.\n\nPlayer position at (0,y_{t_1}) = (0,2) at turn t_1=30.\n\nThen actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1 + 0} to a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn this case, t_1=30, H=7, so actions at t=30 to 36 (since t_1 + 0 to t_1 +6 for H=7? t from 0 to 6 for H=7 actions.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so for t=0: turn 30, t=1: turn 31, ..., t=6: turn 36.\n\nThen after action at turn 36, position at turn 37 is y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd turn 37 = t_1 + H = 30 + 7 = 37.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo the sequence is all U from turn 30 to 36.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be listed.\n\nNow, I think that's it.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there a way with H=6? Then I need to be at y=9 at turn 36.\n\nBut from y=2 at t=30, to y=9 at t=36, that requires increasing by 7 in 6 steps, which means average more than 1 per step, but since I can only change by 0 or ±1, impossible to gain 7 in 6 steps; maximum gain is 6 if all up, but 2+6=8, not 9. So impossible. Minimum 7 steps. So H=7 is indeed minimal.\n\nSimilarly, with down or stay, it would take more or same, but not less.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is all up.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 30\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe car positions and movements were analyzed for each freeway relative to turn \\(t = 30\\) (i.e., \\(\\tau = T - 30\\)):\n\n- **Freeway 1**: Always safe for \\(\\tau \\geq 0\\).\n- **Freeway 2**: Unsafe at \\(\\tau = 3\\) (i.e., turn 33).\n- **Freeway 3**: Unsafe at \\(\\tau = 3\\) (i.e., turn 33).\n- **Freeway 4**: Always safe for \\(\\tau \\geq 0\\).\n- **Freeway 5**: Always safe for \\(\\tau \\geq 0\\).\n- **Freeway 6**: Unsafe at \\(\\tau = 5\\) and \\(\\tau = 6\\) (i.e., turns 35 and 36).\n- **Freeway 7**: Always safe for \\(\\tau \\geq 0\\).\n- **Freeway 8**: Unsafe at \\(\\tau = 13, 14, 15, 16\\) (i.e., turns 43, 44, 45, 46).\n- **y = 0 and y = 9**: Always safe (no cars).\n\nThe minimum number of turns to reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 2\\) is 7, as each upward move increases \\(y\\) by 1, and no fewer moves are possible. A sequence of all \"U\" (up) actions achieves this without collisions:\n\n- At turn 30 (\\(\\tau = 0\\)), the player is at \\(y = 2\\) (safe).\n- Action U: player moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 31 (\\(\\tau = 1\\), safe).\n- Action U: player moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 32 (\\(\\tau = 2\\), safe).\n- Action U: player moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 33 (\\(\\tau = 3\\), safe).\n- Action U: player moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 34 (\\(\\tau = 4\\), safe; note \\(y = 6\\) is unsafe at \\(\\tau = 5\\) and \\(\\tau = 6\\), but \\(\\tau = 4\\) is safe).\n- Action U: player moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 35 (\\(\\tau = 5\\), safe).\n- Action U: player moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 36 (\\(\\tau = 6\\), safe; note \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe at later \\(\\tau\\), but \\(\\tau = 6\\) is safe).\n- Action U: player moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 37 (\\(\\tau = 7\\), safe).\n\nThus, after 7 actions (turns 30 to 36), the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 37.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, and I have to avoid being on a row when a car is at position 0 on that row at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each turn relative to turn t1=31. The cars are defined at turn t1, and I need to find their positions at future turns T > t1.\n\nThe car movement is given by:\n\n- For left-moving cars: Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the table, for example, freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48). But direction is right, so for right-moving, it should be different.\n\nLet's clarify the notation.\n\nIn the car state table, it says: Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nAnd for direction:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] and it moves left, so at T, [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut if it's moving left, decreasing x, so head and tail both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h]? No.\n\nLook: \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nBut for right-moving, it says: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48). So head h = -48, tail τ = -95? But for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h] which would be [-95, -48]? That seems messy.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nPerhaps for both directions, head is the front, tail is the back, so for left-moving, head is left, tail is right? But typically, head is the leading part.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's interpret the span.\n\nFor a car, at time t1, it occupies positions from min to max inclusive.\n\nFor left-moving car: at t1, positions from τ to h? The notation says \"head h, tail τ\", and for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], but if it's moving left, and h is head, probably h is the front, so for left-moving, front is smaller x, so if h is head and left, then h < τ, so [h, τ] means from h to τ, with h smaller.\n\nIn freeway 1: h=-48, τ=-95, but -48 > -95, so if [h, τ] = [-48, -95], that would be empty if we think of interval, but it's a span, so probably it's from min to max.\n\nI think I need to assume that the span is given as [min, max] or [start, end].\n\nLet's look at the car update.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → moves left, so at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] where ΔT = T-t1.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (h, τ, d, s) = (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-95, -48] because τ=-95, h=-48, and -95 < -48, so [ -95, -48 ] which makes sense, positions from -95 to -48.\n\nThen at T, Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-95 + 48ΔT, -48 + 48ΔT]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor freeway 2: (-24, -35, right, 12) and (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: h=-24, τ=-35, d=right, s=12. Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nSecond car: h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12. τ=37, h=48, so [τ, h] = [37,48]\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIn the second car, τ=37, h=48, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: (48,83, left,36) so d=left, s=36, h=48, τ=83.\n\nFor left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ] = [48,83], and since moving left, at T, [48 - 36ΔT, 83 - 36ΔT]\n\nBut 48 to 83, moving left, so head at 48, tail at 83? If moving left, head should be on the left, so smaller x, but 48 < 83, so if head is 48, it's on the left, tail on the right at 83, yes.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, head on the right.\n\nSo general: for a car, at t1, positions from min to max, with head being the front.\n\n- Left-moving: front at smaller x, so min = head, max = tail\n\n- Right-moving: front at larger x, so min = tail, max = head\n\nAnd in notation, for left: [h, τ] with h <= τ? In freeway 4, h=48, τ=83, 48<83, so [h,τ] from h to τ.\n\nFor right, in freeway 1, h=-48, τ=-95, but τ=-95 < h=-48, so [τ,h] from τ to h, with τ < h.\n\nIn the update, it's consistent.\n\nSo for collision, at turn T, for the row y that I am on, if there is a car on that freeway with 0 in its span at T, I collide.\n\nBut note: I am at (0, y_t), and the freeway is y, so for each row y, cars on that row.\n\nIn the table, freeway k corresponds to row y=k.\n\nSo at turn T, I am at y_T, and if for that y, there is a car with 0 in [min(T), max(T)], I collide.\n\nAlso, important: I move at each turn: at turn T, I choose action, which determines y_{T+1}, but the position at turn T is (0, y_T), and collision is checked based on y_T at turn T.\n\nThe note says: if I move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, only on y_T.\n\nSpecifically, at turn T, I am on row y_T, and I check cars on row y_T for that turn.\n\nIf I move up or down, at the next turn I am on new row.\n\nNow, I start at turn t1=31, position y=3.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, but freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 should be safe, no cars, I assume.\n\nThe grid is y=0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 no cars, I think.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, where I start or something, but in this case, I am at y=3.\n\nThe player position is (0,y), so x=0, y vertical.\n\nCars are on the freeways, each row y=1 to 8.\n\nAt y=0 and y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nI need to get to (0,9).\n\nActions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same).\n\ny must be between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nI need min H, sequence of actions.\n\nFirst, since I need to go from y=3 to y=9, I need to increase y by 6, so min H would be 6 if I can go up every turn without collision.\n\nBut I have to avoid cars on rows 4 to 8 when I am on them.\n\ny=3 to y=9, so I will pass through y=4,5,6,7,8, and end at 9.\n\nBut I can stay or move down, but since I need to go up, moving down might not help, but to avoid cars, I might need to wait.\n\nSince min H, I should try to go up as fast as possible, only delay if necessary.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars and their positions over time.\n\nDefine ΔT = T - t1 = T - 31.\n\nFor each freeway, for each car, the span at T is:\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (h,τ,d,s) = (-48,-95,right,48)\n\nd=right, so Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-95 + 48ΔT, -48 + 48ΔT]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -95 + 48ΔT, -48 + 48ΔT ]\n\nSimilarly, Freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,12) → Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-35 + 12ΔT, -24 + 12ΔT]\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,12) → τ=37, h=48, d=right, s=12 → Span(T) = [37 + 12ΔT, 48 + 12ΔT]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"3 | (-24, -35, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12)\" so identical to freeway 2.\n\nProbably a typo or same configuration.\n\nFreeway 4: (48,83,left,36) → d=left, Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] = [48 - 36ΔT, 83 - 36ΔT]\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4? \"5 | (48, 83, left, 36)\" so identical.\n\nFreeway 6: (-24,-35,right,6) → one car, d=right, Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-35 + 6ΔT, -24 + 6ΔT]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-48,-59,right,4) and (16,5,right,4)\n\nFirst car: h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=4 → Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-59 + 4ΔT, -48 + 4ΔT]\n\nSecond car: (16,5,right,4) → τ=5, h=16, d=right, s=4 → Span(T) = [5 + 4ΔT, 16 + 4ΔT]\n\nτ=5, h=16, so [5+4ΔT, 16+4ΔT]\n\nFreeway 8: (-36,-47,right,3) → one car, d=right, Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-47 + 3ΔT, -36 + 3ΔT]\n\nNow, collision occurs at row y at turn T if for that y, there is a car with 0 in its span at T.\n\nFor example, row y=1 at T: check freeway 1 cars.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI need to be at row y at turn T only if it is safe, i.e., no car at position 0 on that row at that turn.\n\nSince I start at t1=31, y=3.\n\nI can choose actions for t=31,32,33,... up to when I reach y=9.\n\nLet me denote the turn relative to t1, so let k = T - t1, so at k=0, T=31, y=3.\n\nI need to find sequence for k=0 to H-1, and at k=H-1, y=9? Turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, and at turn t1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nLet's clarify the turn indexing.\n\nThe sequence is for turns t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so actions a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, and position after action, at turn t1 + t, position y_{t1 + t}.\n\nAt turn T = t1 + t, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nBut we care about position at turn T, y_T.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, we have y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, at T=31, y=3.\n\nIf I do action at T=31, it affects y for T=32.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T, determined by actions up to T-1.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, and I choose action for the next position.\n\nBut collision is based on y_T at turn T.\n\nFor min H, since I need to go from y=3 to y=9, min steps is 6, if I go up every time.\n\nBut I might be blocked.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row and each time, if it is safe to be there.\n\nSince the cars move, the safety changes with time.\n\nI need to find when each row has a car at position 0.\n\nThat is, for each freeway y, and each time T, if there is a car on y with 0 in its span at T.\n\nThen for row y, at time T, it is unsafe if such car exists.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nThen I can plan a path from (t=31, y=3) to some (t, y=9) with min time.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe, but I start at 3, need to go to 9, so probably not going to 0.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway, when position 0 is occupied.\n\nStart with freeway 1, y=1.\n\nCars: one car, Span(T) = [-95 + 48ΔT, -48 + 48ΔT] with ΔT = T-31\n\n0 in span if -95 + 48ΔT <= 0 <= -48 + 48ΔT\n\nSince the car is moving right, span increasing.\n\nLower bound: -95 + 48ΔT <= 0 ⇒ 48ΔT <= 95 ⇒ ΔT <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so ΔT <=1 since integer.\n\nUpper bound: 0 <= -48 + 48ΔT ⇒ 48ΔT >=48 ⇒ ΔT >=1\n\nSo for ΔT=1, 0 in span? Check:\n\nAt ΔT=1, lower = -95+48= -47, upper = -48+48=0\n\nSo span [-47, 0], so 0 is included, since upper=0.\n\n[ -47, 0 ] means positions from -47 to 0 inclusive, so 0 is occupied.\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=31, lower= -95, upper= -48, both negative, 0 not in [-95,-48].\n\nAt ΔT=2, lower= -95+96=1, upper= -48+96=48, 0 not in [1,48].\n\nSo only at ΔT=1, T=32, 0 is occupied on row 1.\n\nSo row 1 is unsafe only at T=32.\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nNow freeway 2, y=2.\n\nTwo cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,12) → Span(T) = [-35 +12ΔT, -24 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -35+12ΔT <=0<= -24+12ΔT\n\nLeft: -35+12ΔT <=0 ⇒ 12ΔT <=35 ⇒ ΔT <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so ΔT <=2\n\nRight: 0 <= -24+12ΔT ⇒ 12ΔT >=24 ⇒ ΔT >=2\n\nSo for ΔT=2: lower= -35+24= -11, upper= -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 occupied.\n\nAt ΔT=1: lower= -35+12= -23, upper= -24+12= -12, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nΔT=3: lower= -35+36=1, upper= -24+36=12, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at ΔT=2, T=33, unsafe for first car.\n\nBut there is second car on same row: (48,37,right,12) → Span(T) = [37+12ΔT, 48+12ΔT]\n\n0 in span? 37+12ΔT <=0<=48+12ΔT\n\nBut 37+12ΔT >=37 >0 for ΔT>=0, so always positive, 0 not in span, since min is at least 37, so never at 0.\n\nSimilarly, at ΔT=0, [37,48], all positive.\n\nSo only first car affects, and only unsafe at T=33.\n\nSecond car never at 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, so y=3 unsafe only at T=33? But y=3 is the row, and I start there.\n\nFreeway 3 has cars, but at T=33, if I am on y=3, might be unsafe.\n\nBut let's compute.\n\nFreeway 3: identical to freeway 2, so same, unsafe only at T=33 for the first car, second car never at 0.\n\nSo for y=3, at T=33, unsafe.\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nNow, at T=31, y=3, is it safe?

ΔT=2, s=6, span [-35+12= -23, -24+12= -12], negative, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=7,8 safe at T=33.\n\nSo at T=33, safe rows are y=0,1,6,7,8,9.\n\ny=2,3,4,5 unsafe.\n\nNow, at T=32, safe rows: all except y=1.\n\ny=1 unsafe at T=32.\n\nAt T=32, y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 safe.\n\nNow, back to start.\n\nAt T=31, y=3, safe.\n\nI need to be at some safe row at T=33.\n\nPossible safe rows at T=33: y=0,1,6,7,8,9.\n\nNow, from T=31 to T=33, I have two actions: for T=31 and T=32, determining y at T=32 and T=33.\n\nAt T=31, I choose action, setting y_{32}.\n\nThen at T=32, choose action, setting y_{33}.\n\nI start at y_{31}=3.\n\nI need y_{33} to be in {0,1,6,7,8,9} for safety.\n\nNow, the change: each action changes y by -1,0,+1.\n\nSo from y=3 at T=31, after two actions, y_{33} can be from 1 to 5, since min y=3-2=1, max y=3+2=5, if I go down twice or up twice.\n\ny_{33} = y_{31} + Δy from two actions.\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,+1, so y_{33} between 3-2=1 and 3+2=5.\n\nBut the safe rows at T=33 are y=0,1,6,7,8,9.\n\ny=0,1 are possible, y=6,7,8,9 not possible since max y_{33}=5 if I go up twice, y=5.\n\ny=5 is not safe at T=33.\n\nPossible y_{33} values: min 1, max 5.\n\nSafe: y=1 is possible, y=0 is min, but y=0: if I go down twice, y=1 at T=33? y_{31}=3, if a_{31}=D, y_{32}=2, then a_{32}=D, y_{33}=1.\n\ny=1 at T=33 is safe.\n\nIf I go down once and stay, etc., but y=1 is achievable and safe.\n\ny=0: if I go down twice, y_{32}=2, y_{33}=1? From y=3, down to y=2, then down to y=1, so y=1 at T=33.\n\nTo get to y=0, I need to go down three times, but in two actions, from T=31 to T=33, only two actions, so y_{33} min is 1, cannot reach y=0 in two steps.\n\nSimilarly, max y=5.\n\nSo possible y_{33}: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nAmong these, only y=1 is safe at T=33.\n\ny=2,3,4,5 all unsafe.\n\nSo I must be at y=1 at T=33 to be safe.\n\nThen, to achieve that, from y=3 at T=31, I need to go down to y=2 at T=32, then down to y=1 at T=33.\n\nAt T=32, y=2 must be safe, which it is, as we saw.\n\nThen at T=33, y=1, safe.\n\nNow, from there, I need to go to y=9.\n\nBut I have to avoid other unsafe times.\n\nNow, y=6 unsafe at T=35,36.\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=43-45, but that is later, might not be issue if I go fast.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at T=43-46.\n\nBut since I am going up, I might reach before that.\n\nFirst, let's write the sequence so far.\n\nStart: T=31, y=3\n\nAction a_{31}: to go down to y=2 at T=32? Action at T=31 determines y_{32}.\n\nIf a_{31} = D, then y_{32} = 3 -1 =2\n\nThen at T=32, y=2, safe.\n\nThen action a_{32} = D, then y_{33} = 2-1 =1\n\nAt T=33, y=1, safe.\n\nNow, from T=33, y=1, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nI need to increase y by 8, from 1 to 9.\n\nMin steps: 8 actions, but I might need to wait or avoid.\n\nNow, at T=33, y=1.\n\nI can choose a_{33}: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, y_{34}=2\n\nIf S, y_{34}=1\n\nIf D, y_{34}=0, but y=0 is safe, but I need to go up.\n\nNow, rows above: y=2,3,4,5 are safe except at T=33, but T=33 is past.\n\nAfter T=33, all rows are safe except at specific times.\n\ny=2: unsafe only at T=33, which is past, so for T>33, y=2 always safe.\n\nSimilarly y=3: unsafe only T=33, so after safe.\n\ny=4: same.\n\ny=5: same.\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=35 and T=36.\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=43,44,45\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=43,44,45,46\n\nNow, from T=33, y=1, I want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on y=6 at T=35 or 36.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nT=35 is soon.\n\nCurrent T=33, y=1.\n\nIf I go up immediately:\n\na_{33} = U, then y_{34} = 2\n\nAt T=34, y=2, safe (since only unsafe at T=33).\n\nThen a_{34}: if U, y_{35} = 3\n\nAt T=35, y=3, is it safe? y=3 is always safe except T=33, so at T=35 safe.\n\nBut y=6 unsafe at T=35, but I am on y=3.\n\nThen continue: a_{34} = U, y_{35}=3\n\nThen at T=35, y=3, safe.\n\nNow a_{35}: if U, y_{36} =4\n\nAt T=36, y=4, safe.\n\nBut I need to go to y=6, but y=6 unsafe at T=36.\n\nT=36, y=6 unsafe.\n\nNow, from y=4 at T=36? Let's see.\n\nAt T=35, y=3, I can choose a_{35}.\n\nIf I go up, a_{35}=U, then y_{36}=4\n\nAt T=36, y=4, safe.\n\nThen a_{36}: if U, y_{37}=5\n\nAt T=37, y=5, safe.\n\nThen a_{37}: U, y_{38}=6\n\nAt T=38, y=6, now is y=6 safe at T=38?\n\ny=6 unsafe at T=35 and 36, but T=38 is later.\n\nAt T=38, ΔT=7, freeway 6 car: span [-35 +6*7, -24 +6*7] = [-35+42=7, -24+42=18], [7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut at T=36, when I am on y=4 or whatever, but y=6 is unsafe only at T=35,36, so if I am not on y=6 at those times, fine.\n\nIn this path, I am on y=6 at T=38, which is safe.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nContinue: from y=6 at T=38, go up: a_{38}=U, y_{39}=7\n\nAt T=39, y=7, safe? y=7 unsafe only at T=43-45, T=39 is before, so safe.\n\nThen a_{39}=U, y_{40}=8\n\nAt T=40, y=8, safe? unsafe at T=43-46, before, safe.\n\na_{40}=U, y_{41}=9\n\nAt T=41, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nBut is that correct? At T=41, y=9, we need to have y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1=31, so at turn t1 + H -1 =41, so 31 + H -1 =41, thus H-1=10, H=11.\n\nTurns: from T=31 to T=41, that's 11 turns? T=31 to T=41 inclusive is 11 turns, but the position is at turn T.\n\nAt turn T=31, y=3\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H -1, position.\n\nFor example, after 0 actions, at turn t1, position.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn t1+1, position, and so on.\n\nSo to be at turn T with y_T.\n\nFrom start T=31, after k steps, at turn T=31 + k.\n\nSet k = number of actions taken.\n\nAt turn t1 + t for t=0,1,2,...,H-1, with actions a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, and at turn t1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nFor t=0, turn t1, position y_{t1}\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, position y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1+H}, but we want at turn t1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nSo the last position is at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nIn terms of turns, from turn 31 to turn 31 + H -1.\n\nFor example, min H=6, at turn 36, y=9.\n\nBut in our case, with detour.\n\nIn the path above:\n\nAt T=31, y=3\n\na_{31}=D (down), so at T=32, y=2\n\na_{32}=D (down), at T=33, y=1\n\nNow from here:\n\na_{33}=U (up), at T=34, y=2\n\na_{34}=U, at T=35, y=3\n\na_{35}=U, at T=36, y=4\n\na_{36}=U, at T=37, y=5\n\na_{37}=U, at T=38, y=6\n\na_{38}=U, at T=39, y=7\n\na_{39}=U, at T=40, y=8\n\na_{40}=U, at T=41, y=9\n\nAt T=41, y=9.\n\nNow, t1=31, T=41, so t1 + H -1 =41, so 31 + H -1=41, H-1=10, H=11.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nI went down to y=1 to avoid T=33, but perhaps I can go up to higher row faster or something.\n\nAnother idea: at T=33, I can be on y=6, which is safe.\n\nBut from y=3 at T=31, in two actions, I can only reach y=5 max, not y=6.\n\ny=6 requires three up actions.\n\nFor example, at T=31, a_{31}=U, to y=4 at T=32.\n\nBut at T=32, y=4, then if I go up, a_{32}=U, y_{33}=5, but at T=33, y=5 unsafe.\n\nIf I go down, y_{33}=3, unsafe.\n\nIf stay, y_{33}=4, unsafe.\n\nNo way to be safe at T=33 from there.\n\nAt T=31, if I stay, a_{31}=S, y_{32}=3, then at T=32, y=3, then if I go up, y_{33}=4, unsafe; stay y_{33}=3 unsafe; down y_{33}=2 unsafe.\n\nOnly by going down to y=1 at T=33 I can be safe.\n\nBut y=1 at T=33, then I go up.\n\nBut in the path, I reached y=9 at T=41.\n\nBut perhaps I can go faster after T=33.\n\nAt T=33, y=1, I need to go to y=9, 8 steps min, but I have to avoid y=6 at T=35,36.\n\nIn the above path, I was on y=6 at T=38, which is after T=36, so safe.\n\nBut T=35 and 36 are before.\n\nIn the path: at T=35, I was on y=3, safe; T=36 on y=4, safe.\n\nNo problem with y=6.\n\nBut I can go up faster.\n\nFor example, from T=33, y=1, instead of going up step by step, but I have to, since I can only change by 1 each turn.\n\nUnless I stay or something, but that would delay.\n\nSo min to go from y=1 to y=9 is 8 up actions, taking 8 turns, from T=33 to T=40 for y=9 at T=41? Let's see.\n\nAt T=33, y=1\n\nAfter first up: T=34, y=2\n\nT=35, y=3\n\nT=36, y=4\n\nT=37, y=5\n\nT=38, y=6\n\nT=39, y=7\n\nT=40, y=8\n\nT=41, y=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut at T=38, y=6, which is safe since T=38>36.\n\nNow, can I be on y=6 before T=35 or after T=36, but since I start from y=1 at T=33, I reach y=6 at T=38, which is after.\n\nIf I go faster, but I can't, because I need to go through each step.\n\nUnless I skip, but I can only change by 1, so I must visit each y.\n\nSo from y=1 to y=9, min 8 turns.\n\nBut in this case, with the initial down, I used two extra turns to go down.\n\nAt start, I did two down actions to go from y=3 to y=1.\n\nBut I could have gone directly if possible, but not.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at T=33, I can be on y=0 or something, but y=0 not reachable in two steps.\n\nOr, since y=6 is safe at T=33, if I can be there.\n\nBut from y=3 at T=31, to y=6 at T=33, that requires three up actions, but only two actions available (at T=31 and T=32), so y_{33} max y=5, cannot reach y=6.\n\nFor example, if at T=31, U, y=4 at T=32; then at T=32, U, y=5 at T=33. But y=5 unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nSo the only way to be safe at T=33 is to be on y=1.\n\nThus the detour is necessary.\n\nBut H=11 turns.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach earlier by going to y=9 directly after.\n\ny=7 and y=8 have unsafe times at T=43-46, but since I reach y=9 at T=41, which is before T=43, so no issue.\n\nT=41 <43, so y=7 at T=39, y=8 at T=40, both before 43, safe.\n\nNow, but I have y=6 unsafe at T=35,36, but I am not on it then.\n\nIn the path, I am on y=6 at T=38, safe.\n\nBut is there a way to save time?\n\nPerhaps from y=1 at T=33, I can go up and reach y=9 faster? No, min 8 steps.\n\nBut I started at y=3, which is closer, but I had to go down.\n\nAnother thought: instead of going down to y=1, perhaps I can go to y=0 at some point, but y=0 might not help.\n\nFor example, at T=31, if I go down, to y=2 at T=32.\n\nThen at T=32, if I go down again, to y=1 at T=33, as before.\n\nIf at T=32, I go down to y=1, but y=1 at T=32 is unsafe, because at T=32, y=1 unsafe.\n\nAt T=32, y=1 is unsafe, as we have.\n\nIn the path, I avoided y=1 at T=32.\n\nIn my sequence, at T=32, I was on y=2, not y=1.\n\nThen at T=33, on y=1.\n\nIf I had gone to y=1 at T=32, it would be unsafe.\n\nSo correct.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at some row to avoid, but in this case, I think 11 is min.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach y=9 by T=37 or something.\n\nMin from start: from y=3 to y=9, 6 steps, but blocked at T=33.\n\nIf I could be on y=6 at T=33, but cannot.\n\nSuppose at T=31, I go up to y=4 at T=32.\n\nThen at T=32, instead of moving, I stay or something, but at T=33 I must move to unsafe row.\n\nUnless I can jump, but no.\n\nPerhaps go to y=5 at T=32, but from y=3, at T=31, if U, to y=4 at T=32, not to y=5 directly.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think going down to y=1 at T=33 is necessary.\n\nThen from there, 8 steps up.\n\nTotal actions: from T=31 to T=41, 11 actions? Let's list the turns.\n\nTurn T=31: action a_{31}, position at T=31 is given, before action? The position is before the action, I think.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0, turn t1, action a_{t1}\n\nAfter a_{t1}, position at turn t1+1.\n\nBut at turn t1, position is given, then we choose action.\n\nIn the collision, at each turn, position at that turn.\n\nIn this case, at turn T, we have position, and we check collision for that turn.\n\nThen we choose action for next.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output actions starting from turn t1.\n\nNow in the path:\n\nAt turn 31: position y=3, we choose action. To go down, so a_{31} = D\n\nThen at turn 32: position y=2 (after moving down), now choose action a_{32} = D (down)\n\nThen at turn 33: position y=1, choose action a_{33} = U (up)\n\nThen turn 34: position y=2, action a_{34} = U\n\nTurn 35: position y=3, action a_{35} = U\n\nTurn 36: position y=4, action a_{36} = U\n\nTurn 37: position y=5, action a_{37} = U\n\nTurn 38: position y=6, action a_{38} = U\n\nTurn 39: position y=7, action a_{39} = U\n\nTurn 40: position y=8, action a_{40} = U\n\nThen at turn 41: position y=9, which is the goal, so we stop here.\n\nNow, at turn 41, y=9, so we need to have this at turn t1 + H -1 =41.\n\nt1=31, so 31 + H -1 =41, thus 30 + H =41, H=11.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=10? t from 0 to H-1.\n\nH-1 =10, so actions a_{31} to a_{40}, 10 actions? Let's count.\n\nActions: a_{31}, a_{32}, ..., a_{40}, that's 10 actions.\n\nThen positions: after a_{31}, at turn 32, y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{40}, at turn 41, y=9.\n\nAnd at turn 41, we have y=9.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=9 is turn 41, which is t1 + H -1.\n\nt1=31, H=11, 31+11-1=41, yes.\n\nNumber of actions: 10.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for turns 31 to 40 inclusive.\n\nNow, but in this, I have 10 actions, H=11.\n\nBut can I reduce?\n\nNotice that at T=35 and T=36, y=6 is unsafe, but in the path, I am not on y=6 then, I am on lower rows.\n\nBut perhaps I can go faster to higher rows to avoid later issues, but no later issues since I finish early.\n\ny=7 and 8 unsafe later but I pass before.\n\nAnother idea: from y=1 at T=33, I can go up and reach y=6 after T=36.\n\nBut min time to y=6 from y=1 is 5 steps: to y=2,3,4,5,6.\n\nAt T=33 y=1, after 5 up actions, at T=38 y=6, same as before.\n\nIf I stay somewhere, it delays.\n\nFor example, at some point, if I stay to avoid y=6 at unsafe times, but since I am not on it, no need.\n\nBut in this case, from y=1 to y=9, min 8 steps.\n\nBut I started at y=3, which is higher, but I had to go down.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=0.\n\ny=0 is always safe.\n\nFor example, at T=31, go down to y=2 at T=32.\n\nThen at T=32, go down to y=1 at T=33, but y=1 at T=33 is safe, as before.\n\nIf at T=32, I go down to y=1, but at T=32, y=1 is unsafe, so I cannot be on y=1 at T=32.\n\nIn my sequence, I didn't.\n\nSuppose at T=31, I go down to y=2 at T=32 (safe).\n\nThen at T=32, I could go down to y=1, but at T=32, if I go down, at turn T=33 position y=1, but during turn T=32, I am at y=2, I choose action down, so at turn T=33, I arrive at y=1.\n\nBut at turn T=32, I am on y=2, which is safe.\n\nThen at turn T=33, I am on y=1, safe.\n\nIf at T=32, I go down, but during the action, when do I collide? Only when on the row at that turn.\n\nAt turn T=32, I am on y=2, not y=1, so no collision with y=1 cars.\n\nThen after moving down, at turn T=33, on y=1.\n\nSo it's fine.\n\nBut y=1 at T=33 is the same.\n\nTo go to y=0: from y=2 at T=32, if I go down, a_{32}=D, then at T=33, y=1.\n\nTo reach y=0, I need another down action later, which would delay reaching y=9.\n\nFor example, if at T=33, y=1, I go down to y=0 at T=34, then from there go up, but that takes extra time.\n\nFor instance: T=33 y=1, a_{33}=D, T=34 y=0\n\nThen a_{34}=U, T=35 y=1\n\na_{35}=U, T=36 y=2\n\nand so on, to y=9 at later turn, say T=42 or something, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, the first path is better.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid going all the way to y=1.\n\nBut at T=33, only y=1 is safe among possible.\n\ny=6 is safe but unreachable.\n\nAnother thought: since rows y=3,4,5 are safe after T=33, but at T=33 I need not to be there.\n\nIn the sequence, after T=33, I go up through them when safe.\n\nBut in the up path, I go through quickly.\n\nBut I had to spend two turns going down first.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=5 before T=33, but y=5 at T=32 is safe, but then at T=33 I have to be somewhere else.\n\nFor example: at T=31, go up to y=4 at T=32 (safe).\n\nThen at T=32, on y=4, I need to move to a safe row for T=33.\n\nSafe rows: y=1,6,7,8,9,0.\n\nBut from y=4, with one action, I can go to y=3,4,5, all unsafe at T=33, or to y=4 if stay, unsafe.\n\nCannot reach y=6 with one action; only to y=3,4,5.\n\nAll unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, from other positions.\n\nSo impossible to be safe at T=33 except by being on y=1 or lower, but y=0 not reachable.\n\nSo y=1 is the only option.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nSequence:\n\nAt turn 31: action D (down)\n\nAt turn 32: position y=2, action D (down)\n\nAt turn 33: position y=1, action U (up)\n\nAt turn 34: position y=2, action U (up)\n\nAt turn 35: position y=3, action U (up)\n\nAt turn 36: position y=4, action U (up)\n\nAt turn 37: position y=5, action U (up)\n\nAt turn 38: position y=6, action U (up)\n\nAt turn 39: position y=7, action U (up)\n\nAt turn 40: position y=8, action U (up)\n\nThen at turn 41: position y=9.\n\nActions from turn 31 to 40, 10 actions, H=11.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t1} etc.\n\nt1=31.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 31: D\n\nTurn 32: D\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nBut I need to reach at turn 41, which is after last action.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at turn 40, leading to y=9 at turn 41.\n\nNow, but I think I missed that at turn 41, no action, position is reached.\n\nIn the sequence, actions up to turn 40.\n\nBut let's see if I can shorten.\n\nNotice that after T=33, from y=1, I go up step by step, but at T=35 and T=36, y=6 is unsafe, but I am not on it, I am on y=3 and y=4, safe.\n\nThen I reach y=6 at T=38, safe.\n\nBut y=6 unsafe only at T=35,36, so if I can be on y=6 before or after.\n\nBut from y=1 at T=33, I can only reach y=6 at T=38 if I go directly, which I do.\n\nIf I go slower, worse.\n\nBut at T=34, I am on y=2, I could stay or something, but no benefit.\n\nFor example, suppose at T=34, I stay, a_{34}=S, then at T=35, y=2, still, then I need to go up later, delay.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nBut H=11, with 10 actions.\n\nBut let's see the number of turns from start.\n\nStarted at turn 31, reached at turn 41, so 10 turns later? Turn 31 to 41 is 10 steps in time, but positions from turn 31 to 41, that's 11 positions, but the actions are between.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier by not going all the way down.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=33, y=7,8,9 are safe, if I can be there.\n\nBut from y=3 at T=31, to y=7 at T=33, impossible, since min two actions, max to y=5.\n\nNo.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have actions, but I need to output for each turn the action.\n\nIn the answer, it should be the actions starting from turn t1.\n\nAlso, in the sequence, at turn 40, I do U to reach y=9 at turn 41.\n\nBut at turn 41, I don't need action since I arrived.\n\nNow, but in the car states, I think I covered all.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 6, for example.\n\ny=6 unsafe at T=35,36.\n\nIn my path, at T=35, I am on y=3, freeway 3: at T=35, ΔT=4, T=31+4=35, freeway 3 cars: first car span [-35+12*4, -24+12*4]= [-35+48=13, -24+48=24], [13,24], not 0.\n\nSecond car [37+48=85,48+48=96], not 0. Safe.\n\nAt T=36, y=4, freeway 4: car left-moving, at ΔT=5, T=36, span [48-36*5,83-36*5]= [48-180=-132,83-180=-97], both negative, not 0. Safe.\n\ny=6 at T=38, as before, safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\ny=7 at T=39, before 43, safe.\n\nEtc.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions:\n\nFrom turn 31 to 40: D, D, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U\n\nBut in the answer format.\n\nAlso, I need to specify H, but in the answer, I think only the sequence, and H is implied.\n\nThe output should be the actions for each turn from t1 to t1+H-1? From the format.\n\n\"Answer Format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\"\n\nSo for turns t1, t1+1, ..., up to the last action before reaching.\n\nSince at turn t1 + H -1, position is 9, and the action at that turn might be to stay or something, but in this case, at turn 40, action U to go to y=9.\n\nIn general, the last action could be S or U or D to reach y=9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 40, y=8, I do U to go to y=9 at turn 41.\n\nThe actions are for turns t1 to t1 + H -1, and after that, at turn t1 + H, position, but we want position at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn T, action a_T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nBut at turn T, position is y_T.\n\nIn the output, for each turn, we output the action at that turn.\n\nAnd after H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1+H}, but we want at turn t1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nSo the position at turn t1 + H -1 is after H-1 actions.\n\nLet k = number of actions.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t1 + k, position.\n\nWe want for some k, at turn t1 + k, y=9, with min k? No.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nFor example, at turn t1, y=3, after 0 actions.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn t1+1, position.\n\n...\n\nAfter m actions, at turn t1 + m, position.\n\nWe want at turn t1 + H -1, y=9, so after (H-1) actions, at turn t1 + (H-1), y=9.\n\nThe actions are taken from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -2? Let's see.\n\nThe turns for actions: turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: turn t1, action a_{t1}, after which position at turn t1+1\n\nt=1: turn t1+1, action a_{t1+1}, position at turn t1+2\n\n...\n\nt=H-1: turn t1 + H -1, action a_{t1 + H -1}, after which position at turn t1 + H\n\nBut we want position at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, position is y_{t1 + H -1}, which is determined before action a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H -1}, we go to y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut at turn t1 + H -1, we are at y_{t1 + H -1}, and we want this to be 9.\n\nThen we choose action, but since we reached, we might not care about the action, but in the sequence, we need to output action for that turn.\n\nIn the case where y_{t1 + H -1} =9, we can choose to stay or something, but to min H, probably we stop.\n\nIn the action sequence, for turn t1 + H -1, if y=9, we might do S, but in this case, since we reach at that turn, the action might not affect, but we need to specify an action.\n\nIn my earlier path, at turn 40, I am at y=8, and I do U to go to y=9 at turn 41.\n\nBut at turn 40, position y=8, I do action U.\n\nThen at turn 41, position y=9.\n\nBut we want position at turn t1 + H -1 =41 to be 9, so t1 + H -1=41, H=11.\n\nAt turn 41, position is 9, but the action for turn 41 is not taken, or we don't need.\n\nIn the sequence, actions up to turn t1 + H -1? Let's see the format.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so for t=0 to H-1, turns t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nAnd at turn t1 + H -1, position should be 9.\n\nIn my case, at turn 40, which is t1 + 9? t1=31, turn 40 is 31+9=40, so t=9? Let's index.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, turn = t1 + t\n\nWhen t=0, turn t1\n\nt=1, turn t1+1\n\n...\n\nt=H-1, turn t1 + H -1\n\nAt this turn, position is y_{t1 + t} = y_{turn}\n\nAfter action, position at turn+1.\n\nWe want at turn t1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nIn my sequence, at turn 40, which should be t1 + H -1 =40, so 31 + H -1 =40, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nt1 + H -1 =40, 31 + H -1 =40, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nBut at turn 40, position should be 9.\n\nIn my path, at turn 40, I have position y=8, because:\n\nAt turn 39: position y=7? Let's list positions:\n\nTurn 31: y=3 (initial)\n\nAfter a_{31}=D, turn 32: y=2\n\nAfter a_{32}=D, turn 33: y=1\n\nAfter a_{33}=U, turn 34: y=2\n\nAfter a_{34}=U, turn 35: y=3\n\nAfter a_{35}=U, turn 36: y=4\n\nAfter a_{36}=U, turn 37: y=5\n\nAfter a_{37}=U, turn 38: y=6\n\nAfter a_{38}=U, turn 39: y=7\n\nAfter a_{39}=U, turn 40: y=8\n\nAt turn 40, y=8, which is not 9.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nSo I need another action: at turn 40, action a_{40}=U, then turn 41: y=9.\n\nBut turn 41 is beyond.\n\nTo have y=9 at turn 40, I need to be there earlier.\n\nBut I reached y=8 at turn 40.\n\nTo have y=9 at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if I can reach y=9 at turn 40.\n\nThen t1 + H -1=40, 31 + H -1=40, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nBut from start, min 6 steps, but with detour.\n\nFrom y=3 to y=9, min 6, but I added two down, so should be 8 actions? But with waits.\n\nIn the sequence, I used 9 actions to go from turn 31 to turn 40 positions.\n\nActions: from turn 31 to 39: 9 actions, leading to positions from turn 32 to 40.\n\nAt turn 40, y=8.\n\nThen to have y=9 at turn 40, I need to be at y=9 at turn 40.\n\nSo I need to reach y=9 by turn 40.\n\nIn the path, I can do one less up or something.\n\nBut I have to go through the down.\n\nFrom turn 33 y=1 to y=9 at turn 40.\n\nTurn 33 to 40 is 7 turns: positions turn 33 to 40.\n\ny from 1 to 9, difference 8, so min 8 steps, so at turn 33 y=1, after 8 actions, at turn 41 y=9.\n\nIf I want at turn 40 y=9, I need to be at y=9 at turn 40, which requires that at turn 39, I am at y=8 or y=9, and choose action.\n\nBut from y=1 at turn 33, to y=9 at turn 40, that's 7 steps, but 7 actions can increase y by at most 7, from 1 to 8, not to 9.\n\ny_{turn} at turn T.\n\nAt turn 33: y=1\n\nAfter action at turn 33, turn 34: y=2 (if up)\n\n...\n\nAfter action at turn 39, turn 40: y=?\n\nAfter k actions from turn 33, at turn 33 + k.\n\nTo have y=9 at turn 40, turn 40 = turn 33 + 7, so after 7 actions from turn 33.\n\nStart turn 33 y=1, after 7 actions, max y=1+7=8, min y=1-7.\n\nSo at turn 40, y <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nThus, impossible to have y=9 at turn 40 from this start.\n\nEarliest at turn 41.\n\nSimilarly, if I start from turn 31 y=3, after actions.\n\nAt turn 31 y=3.\n\nAfter m actions, at turn 31 + m.\n\ny at turn 31 + m <= 3 + m.\n\nWe want at turn t1 + H -1 = 31 + H -1, y=9.\n\nSo 3 + (H-1) <= 9? Not necessarily, because I might go down.\n\nBut min, if no down, y = 3 + number of up minus down.\n\nBut in this case, with the detour, I have two down and then eight up, net +6, from 3 to 9.\n\nNumber of actions: 10 actions (two down, eight up), leading to turn 41 y=9.\n\nAt turn 41, y=9.\n\nTurn t1 + H -1 =41, 31 + H -1=41, H-1=10, H=11.\n\nActions from turn 31 to 40, 10 actions.\n\nIn the sequence for the box.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 31: D\n\nTurn 32: D\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nFor turn 40, action U, which takes to y=9 at turn 41.\n\nBut at turn 40, position is y=8, I do U.\n\nThen at turn 41, position y=9.\n\nAnd turn 41 is t1 + H -1 with H=11.\n\nIf I want to have action for turn 41, but I don't need, since I reached.\n\nIn the sequence, actions up to turn 40.\n\nNow, in the answer, I think this is fine.\n\nPerhaps I can have a shorter sequence by staying at some point, but I don't think so.\n\nFor example, if at turn 33, y=1, I go up, but to avoid y=6 at T=36, but I am not on it, so no need.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=5 quickly, then stay to pass the unsafe time for y=6, but since I can go after, it might not save time.\n\nFor instance, from y=1 at T=33:\n\na_{33}=U, T=34 y=2\n\na_{34}=U, T=35 y=3\n\na_{35}=U, T=36 y=4\n\nNow at T=36, y=4, I can stay: a_{36}=S, then T=37 y=4\n\nThen a_{37}=U, T=38 y=5\n\na_{38}=U, T=39 y=6\n\nBut at T=39, y=6, which is after T=36, safe.\n\nThen a_{39}=U, T=40 y=7\n\na_{40}=U, T=41 y=8\n\na_{41}=U, T=42 y=9\n\nNow at T=42 y=9, later than before.\n\nWorse.\n\nFrom T=36 y=4, go up to y=5 at T=37, etc., still reach later.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus the first sequence is minimal.\n\nSo H=11.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 31 to 40 actions.\n\nBut in turn 33, I have U, but at that point y=1, I go up.\n\nAll seems fine.\n\nNow to write.\n\nBut in freeway 7 and 8, unsafe later, but I finish before.\n\nT=41 <43, so no issue.\n\nSo the minimal sequence is 10 actions, H=11.\n\nBut in the output, I need to list the actions.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 3 and 2 are same, but I think I handled.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 33, when I am on y=1, is it safe? Yes, as computed.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 31\\) is 11. This requires 10 actions, from turn 31 to turn 40, resulting in the player reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 41.\n\nThe sequence of actions is determined by avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at each turn. The critical unsafe times are:\n- \\(y = 1\\) unsafe only at turn 32.\n- \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\) unsafe only at turn 33.\n- \\(y = 6\\) unsafe at turns 35 and 36.\n- \\(y = 7\\) unsafe at turns 43, 44, 45.\n- \\(y = 8\\) unsafe at turns 43, 44, 45, 46.\n\nTo avoid being on rows \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\) at the unsafe turn 33, the player must move down to \\(y = 1\\) by turn 33. Starting from \\(y = 3\\) at turn 31, the player moves down twice to reach \\(y = 1\\) at turn 33, which is safe. Then, the player moves up consistently to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 41, avoiding the unsafe times for \\(y = 6\\) (turns 35 and 36) by being on lower rows during those turns.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n- At turn 31, move down (D) to reach \\(y = 2\\) at turn 32.\n- At turn 32, move down (D) to reach \\(y = 1\\) at turn 33.\n- At turn 33, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 2\\) at turn 34.\n- At turn 34, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 3\\) at turn 35.\n- At turn 35, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 4\\) at turn 36.\n- At turn 36, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 5\\) at turn 37.\n- At turn 37, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 6\\) at turn 38.\n- At turn 38, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 7\\) at turn 39.\n- At turn 39, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 40.\n- At turn 40, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 41.\n\nAt turn 41, \\(y = 9\\) is reached, and since \\(y = 9\\) has no cars, it is safe. The unsafe times for \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) (turns 43-46) are avoided as the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) before turn 43.\n\nThus, the sequence of actions for turns 31 to 40 is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 31: D \\\\\nTurn 32: D \\\\\nTurn 33: U \\\\\nTurn 34: U \\\\\nTurn 35: U \\\\\nTurn 36: U \\\\\nTurn 37: U \\\\\nTurn 38: U \\\\\nTurn 39: U \\\\\nTurn 40: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 through 8. The player moves vertically, and the cars move horizontally on their respective lanes. Collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y=k, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. The car positions are given at turn t_1 = 34, and I need to find where they are at future turns relative to t_1.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t_1, so at time T, for each car, the span changes based on direction and speed.\n\nFor a left-moving car: span at T is [h - s * Δt, τ - s * Δt]\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s * Δt, h + s * Δt]\n\nIn the table, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor example, on freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nSince it's right-moving, head is at -48, tail at -95? That seems odd because usually head should be ahead, but let's see the direction.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, span is [τ, h], so tail τ, head h.\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nBut for direction, it defines how it moves.\n\nFor right-moving, it says: span(t1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nSimilarly for left: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nIn the freeway 1 entry: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nSo for right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-95, -48]\n\nThen at T, span is [ -95 + 48 * Δt, -48 + 48 * Δt ]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on that freeway, i.e., y_T = k, and for some car on freeway k, 0 is in the span at T.\n\nAlso, note that when you move to a new y, you are not on that y until the next turn. Specifically: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", so at turn T, you are still on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1} at the end of the turn or something? Let me read carefully.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, based on action at t.\n\nSo at time t, you are at position y_t, and you choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn T: it says \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd the note: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, even if 0 is in their span at T, but you might collide at T+1 if you are on it then.\n\nBut at turn T, you are on y_T.\n\nSo, for each turn, when you are at y_t, if y_t is between 1 and 8, you need to check if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at time t.\n\nIf y_t = 0 or 9, no car, so safe.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is y=9, and since y=9 has no cars, once you are at y=9, you are safe.\n\nNow, initial position at t1=34 is (0,0), so y_{34} = 0.\n\nWe need to get to y = 9.\n\nActions: U (up), D (down), S (stay). But since we start at 0, and want to go to 9, down might not be useful, but could be to avoid cars? But y is from 0 to 9, and we start at 0, so if we go down, y_{t+1} = y_t -1, but y_t >=0, so if y_t=0, D would make y_{t+1} = -1? But it says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so probably it clamps to 0 or something? Let's see.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, Δy_t = -1, but y_{t+1} = -1 not in [0,9], so I assume it stays at 0? The inequality says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so it must be that if the move would take it out, it stays at boundary.\n\nSimilarly for y=9 and U.\n\nIn this case, since we start at 0, D is not possible, or it does nothing.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, U does nothing.\n\nBut here we start at 0.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to go up, but we have to pass through y=1 to 8, each of which has cars moving.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H: since we start at y=0 and end at y=9, the minimum possible is 9 turns if we go up every turn, but we might need to wait or something to avoid cars.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t= t1 to t1 + H -1, so after H actions, we are at turn t1 + H.\n\nAt turn t, we take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t1, we are at y_{t1} = 0.\n\nWe take action a_{t1}, which sets y_{t1 +1}.\n\nThen at turn t1 +1, we take a_{t1 +1}, sets y_{t1 +2}, and so on, until some turn T where y_T =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t= t1 to t= t1 + H -1, and after H actions, at turn t1 + H, y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=9 is t1 + H.\n\nBut collision is checked at each turn t from t1 to t1 + H -1, I think, because at turn t, we are at y_t, and if y_t between 1 and 8, we need no collision.\n\nAt turn t1 + H, we are at y=9, which is safe.\n\nSo for turns t from t1 to t1 + H -1, we need to be safe, meaning if y_t in 1-8, no car collision at that turn.\n\ny_t is the position at the start of turn t, I think.\n\nAt turn t, we are at position (0, y_t), then we choose action a_t, which moves us to y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nAnd during turn t, we are at y_t, so collision check is for y_t at time t.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and need to go to y=9, each U increases y by 1, S keeps it same, D decreases, but D from 0 does nothing, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, U does nothing.\n\nBut since we want to go up, probably we use U mostly, but may need S to wait for cars to pass.\n\nD might not be useful since we start at 0, and going down is not helpful, but from higher y, D could be used to avoid, but since we need to reach 9, probably not efficient, so I think only U and S are useful, D can be ignored except at boundaries where it does nothing.\n\nSo actions are U or S, essentially.\n\nNow, the freeways are y=1 to 8, each has cars.\n\nI need to find for each freeway k, and for each time t, whether there is a car such that 0 is in its span at time t.\n\nBecause if the player is on freeway k at time t, and 0 in some car span on k at t, collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, the spans change over time.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nSince right-moving, at t1=34, span: [τ, h] = [-95, -48]\n\nAt time T, span: [ -95 + 48 * Δt, -48 + 48 * Δt ] where Δt = T - 34\n\n0 in span when -95 + 48 Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 48 Δt\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars: (48, 37, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) — head=48, tail=37? For right-moving, span should be [τ, h], so tail=37, head=48? But 37 to 48, which is increasing, but direction right, so moving right.\n\nAt t1, span [37,48]? No.\n\nThe notation: (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h]\n\nSo for (48,37,right,12), h=48, τ=37, so span = [37,48]\n\nBut 37 to 48, with direction right, so moving right, so at T, span [37 + 12 Δt, 48 + 12 Δt]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (0, -11, right, 12) , h=0, τ=-11, span = [-11, 0] at t1.\n\nThen at T, span [-11 + 12 Δt, 0 + 12 Δt] = [-11 + 12 Δt, 12 Δt]\n\nNow, freeway 3: same as freeway 2: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12) — identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: (48,83,left,36) — left-moving.\n\nFor left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] = [48,83]? h=48, τ=83, but for left-moving, span is [h, τ], and since left-moving, head is left or what?\n\nDefinition: for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nIn this case, (48,83,left,36), so h=48, τ=83, so at t1, span [48,83]\n\nThen at T, [48 - 36 Δt, 83 - 36 Δt]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as freeway 4: (48,83,left,36)\n\nFreeway 6: (-48,-59,right,6) — right-moving.\n\nh=-48, τ=-59, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T: [-59 + 6 Δt, -48 + 6 Δt]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4)\n\nSimilar to freeway 2 but speed 4.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4), span at t1: [37,48]\n\nAt T: [37 + 4 Δt, 48 + 4 Δt]\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,4), span at t1: [-11,0]\n\nAt T: [-11 + 4 Δt, 4 Δt]\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,3) — right-moving.\n\nh=-48, τ=-59, span at t1: [-59, -48]\n\nAt T: [-59 + 3 Δt, -48 + 3 Δt]\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when 0 is in the span for any car on that freeway at time t.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway k and time t, is there a car such that the span contains 0 at t.\n\nThen, when the player is on that freeway at time t, it must not be that case.\n\nNow, since the player moves vertically, we need to plan the path.\n\nTo minimize turns, we should go up as fast as possible, but may need to wait on some rows.\n\nThe rows are y=0 to y=9, y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nWe start at y=0 at t=34.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn T.\n\nThe position y_t changes based on actions.\n\nSince we can only change by -1,0,1 each turn, and from 0 to 9, min steps is 9 if we go up every turn.\n\nBut with cars, we may need to stay or go slower.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway k, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when 0 is covered by some car.\n\nThen, for the player to be on freeway k at time t, it must be that at time t, freeway k is safe.\n\nNow, time t is absolute, starting from t=34.\n\nSet t_rel = t - 34, so Δt = t_rel.\n\nt=34, t_rel=0; t=35, t_rel=1, etc.\n\nI'll use t for absolute time.\n\nFor each freeway, find for which t, 0 is in some car span.\n\nStart with freeway 1: only one car, right-moving, span at t: [ -95 + 48 (t-34), -48 + 48 (t-34) ]\n\n0 in span when lower <= 0 <= upper\n\nLower: -95 + 48(t-34) <= 0 <= -48 + 48(t-34)\n\nSo -95 + 48(t-34) <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 48(t-34)\n\nFirst inequality: -95 + 48(t-34) <= 0 => 48(t-34) <= 95 => t-34 <= 95/48 = 1.979... so t-34 <= 1 since t integer? t is turn, integer.\n\nt-34 <= floor(95/48) = 1, since 48*1=48<95, 48*2=96>95, so t-34 <=1? Let's see.\n\n-95 + 48(t-34) <= 0 => 48(t-34) <= 95\n\nt-34 <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so since t integer, t-34 <= 1? 48*1=48 <=95, 48*2=96>95, so for t-34 <=1, inequality holds? Let's clarify.\n\nWe need both inequalities.\n\nFirst: -95 + 48(t-34) <= 0 => 48(t-34) <= 95 => t-34 <= floor(95/48) = 1? But 48*1=48 <=95, 48*2=96>95, so for t-34 =0,1: 48(0)=0<=95, 48(1)=48<=95, t-34=2:96>95, so for t-34 <=1, the first inequality holds.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 48(t-34) => 48 <= 48(t-34) => 1 <= t-34\n\nSo t-34 >=1\n\nThus from first: t-34 <=1 and from second t-34 >=1, so t-34 =1\n\nThus at t-34=1, i.e., t=35\n\nCheck: at t=35, Δt=1, span: [-95+48, -48+48] = [-47, 0]\n\nSo 0 is included, since upper is 0.\n\n0 <= 0 is true.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nFor example, t=34, span [-95,-48], 0 not in.\n\nt=36, span [-95+96, -48+96] = [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 1 unsafe only at t=35.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) span at t: [37 + 12(t-34), 48 + 12(t-34)]\n\n0 in span: 37 +12(t-34) <= 0 <= 48 +12(t-34)\n\nFirst, 37 +12(t-34) <=0 => 12(t-34) <= -37? But left side >=0 for t>=34, right negative, impossible. So never <=0, thus 0 never in this span, since lower bound min at t=34 is 37>0, and increasing, so always >0, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (0,-11,right,12) span at t: [-11 +12(t-34), 12(t-34)]\n\n0 in span: -11 +12(t-34) <= 0 <= 12(t-34)\n\nFirst: -11 +12(t-34) <=0 => 12(t-34) <=11 => t-34 <= 11/12 <1, so t-34 <=0\n\nSecond: 0 <= 12(t-34) => t-34 >=0\n\nSo t-34=0, i.e., t=34\n\nAt t=34, span: [-11,0], so 0 is included.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nFor example t=35, span [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nt=33, but t>=34, so only t=34.\n\nThus for freeway 2, unsafe only at t=34, due to second car.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2, so unsafe only at t=34.\n\nFreeway 4: (48,83,left,36) left-moving.\n\nSpan at t: [48 -36(t-34), 83 -36(t-34)]\n\n0 in span: 48 -36(t-34) <= 0 <= 83 -36(t-34)\n\nFirst inequality: 48 -36(t-34) <=0 => 48 <= 36(t-34) => t-34 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so t-34 >= 2 since integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 83 -36(t-34) => 36(t-34) <=83 => t-34 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so t-34 <=2\n\nThus t-34 >=2 and t-34 <=2, so t-34=2, t=36\n\nAt t=36, span: [48-72, 83-72]? Δt=2, [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11], so 0 is in [-24,11], yes.\n\nAt other times: t=35, Δt=1, [48-36,83-36]=[12,47], 0 not in.\n\nt=37, Δt=3, [48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 4 unsafe only at t=36.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4, so unsafe only at t=36.\n\nFreeway 6: (-48,-59,right,6) right-moving.\n\nSpan at t: [-59 +6(t-34), -48 +6(t-34)]\n\n0 in span: -59 +6(t-34) <= 0 <= -48 +6(t-34)\n\nFirst: -59 +6(t-34) <=0 => 6(t-34) <=59 => t-34 <= 59/6 ≈9.833, so t-34 <=9\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +6(t-34) => 48 <=6(t-34) => t-34 >= 48/6=8\n\nSo t-34 >=8 and t-34 <=9\n\nThus t-34=8 or 9, t=42 or 43\n\nAt t=42, Δt=8, span: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], so 0 in.\n\nAt t=43, Δt=9, span: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt t=44, Δt=10, [-59+60, -48+60]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 6 unsafe at t=42 and 43.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) span at t: [37 +4(t-34), 48 +4(t-34)]\n\n0 in span: 37 +4(t-34) <=0 <=48 +4(t-34)\n\nFirst inequality: 37 +4(t-34) <=0? 4(t-34) <= -37, impossible since left >=0 for t>=34, so never, 0 not in this span.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,4) span at t: [-11 +4(t-34), 4(t-34)]\n\n0 in span: -11 +4(t-34) <=0 <=4(t-34)\n\nFirst: -11 +4(t-34) <=0 => 4(t-34) <=11 => t-34 <= 11/4=2.75, so t-34 <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <=4(t-34) => t-34 >=0\n\nSo t-34=0,1,2\n\nt=34,35,36\n\nAt t=34, span: [-11,0], 0 in\n\nt=35, span: [-11+4,4] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nt=36, span: [-11+8,8] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nt=37, span: [-11+12,12]=[1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo for second car, unsafe at t=34,35,36\n\nThus freeway 7 unsafe at t=34,35,36\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,3) span at t: [-59 +3(t-34), -48 +3(t-34)]\n\n0 in span: -59 +3(t-34) <=0 <= -48 +3(t-34)\n\nFirst: -59 +3(t-34) <=0 => 3(t-34) <=59 => t-34 <= 59/3≈19.666, so t-34 <=19\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +3(t-34) => 48 <=3(t-34) => t-34 >= 16\n\nSo t-34 >=16 and t-34 <=19\n\nThus t=50,51,52,53? t-34 from 16 to 19 inclusive.\n\nt-34=16,17,18,19 → t=50,51,52,53\n\nAt t=50, Δt=16, span: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nt=51, Δt=17, [-59+51, -48+51] = [-8,3], 0 in\n\nt=52, Δt=18, [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nt=53, Δt=19, [-59+57, -48+57] = [-2,9], 0 in\n\nt=54, Δt=20, [-59+60, -48+60]=[1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo freeway 8 unsafe at t=50,51,52,53\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, unsafe times:\n\ny=1: unsafe only at t=35\n\ny=2: unsafe only at t=34\n\ny=3: unsafe only at t=34\n\ny=4: unsafe only at t=36\n\ny=5: unsafe only at t=36\n\ny=6: unsafe at t=42,43\n\ny=7: unsafe at t=34,35,36\n\ny=8: unsafe at t=50,51,52,53\n\nNow, y=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at t=34, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nAt each turn, we choose action U, D, or S.\n\nBut D from y=0 does nothing, similarly, at y=9 U does nothing.\n\nTo minimize time, we should use U as much as possible, but avoid being on unsafe freeway at unsafe time.\n\nThe position y_t: at turn t, y_t.\n\nAt t=34, y_34 = 0.\n\nNow, we take action a_t to set y_{t+1}.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on action.\n\nWe need y_T =9 for some T.\n\nAnd for each t from 34 to T-1, if y_t between 1 and 8, it must be safe at time t.\n\nAt turn t, when we are at y_t, we are on that row at time t.\n\nFor example, at t=34, we are at y=0, which is safe.\n\nThen we take action, say a_34, which determines y_35.\n\nThen at t=35, we are at y_35, and so on.\n\nTo reach y=9, the earliest possible is if we go up every turn: y_34=0, a_34=U, y_35=1; a_35=U, y_36=2; ... up to y_43=9? Let's see:\n\nt=34: y=0\n\na=U, y=1 at t=35\n\nt=35: y=1\n\na=U, y=2 at t=36\n\nt=36: y=2\n\na=U, y=3 at t=37\n\nt=37: y=3\n\na=U, y=4 at t=38\n\nt=38: y=4\n\na=U, y=5 at t=39\n\nt=39: y=5\n\na=U, y=6 at t=40\n\nt=40: y=6\n\na=U, y=7 at t=41\n\nt=41: y=7\n\na=U, y=8 at t=42\n\nt=42: y=8\n\na=U, y=9 at t=43\n\nAt t=43, y=9, safe.\n\nBut we need to check for each t from 34 to 42, if y_t in 1-8, is it safe at that time.\n\nt=34: y=0, safe, no issue.\n\nt=35: y=1, now freeway y=1 is unsafe at t=35, so collision! Cannot be on y=1 at t=35.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=35, y=1, and y=1 unsafe at t=35, so collision.\n\nTherefore, cannot go directly up at t=35 to y=1.\n\nWe need to avoid that.\n\nSimilarly, other points.\n\nSince y=1 is unsafe only at t=35, we can be on y=1 at other times.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 unsafe at t=34, etc.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe times again:\n\ny=1: t=35\n\ny=2: t=34\n\ny=3: t=34\n\ny=4: t=36\n\ny=5: t=36\n\ny=6: t=42,43\n\ny=7: t=34,35,36\n\ny=8: t=50-53\n\nWe start at t=34, y=0.\n\nAt t=34, if we go to y=1, but y=1 at t=35: at turn t=34, we are at y=0, safe.\n\nAction a_34: if U, then y_35=1.\n\nBut at turn t=35, we are at y=1, and y=1 unsafe at t=35, so collision.\n\nIf we do S at t=34, then y_35=0, still at start.\n\nThen at t=35, we are at y=0, safe, then we can go to y=1 at t=36? Let's see.\n\ny_t is position at turn t.\n\nAfter action, y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at t=34: y_34=0\n\nIf a_34=S, then y_35=0\n\nThen at t=35, y_35=0, we can take action, say U, then y_36=1\n\nNow at t=36, we are at y=1, and y=1 is unsafe only at t=35, not at t=36, so safe.\n\nThen we can proceed.\n\nBut we need to check all.\n\nIn the min time path, we might go up slowly.\n\nSince y=7 is unsafe from t=34 to 36, we need to avoid being on y=7 during those times.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 unsafe at t=42,43, etc.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly, we should go up as fast as possible, but delay when necessary.\n\nFirst, from start: at t=34, we can do S to stay at 0, then at t=35, go to y=1.\n\nt=34: y=0, safe. Action S, then y_35=0\n\nt=35: y=0, safe. Action U, then y_36=1\n\nt=36: now y=1, and y=1 is safe at t=36 (only unsafe at t=35). So safe. Action U, then y_37=2\n\nt=37: y=2, now y=2 unsafe only at t=34, so at t=37 safe. Action U, y_38=3\n\nt=38: y=3, y=3 unsafe only at t=34, safe. Action U, y_39=4\n\nt=39: y=4, y=4 unsafe only at t=36, so at t=39 safe. Action U, y_40=5\n\nt=40: y=5, y=5 unsafe only at t=36, safe. Action U, y_41=6\n\nt=41: y=6, now y=6 unsafe at t=42 and 43, but t=41, so safe. Action U, y_42=7\n\nt=42: y=7, now y=7 unsafe at t=34,35,36, and t=42>36, so safe? t=42, y=7 unsafe times are 34,35,36, all less than 42, so at t=42, safe. Similarly, y=7 unsafe only up to t=36, so for t>36, safe.\n\nAction U, then y_43=8\n\nt=43: y=8, now y=8 unsafe at t=50-53, t=43<50, so safe. Action U, y_44=9\n\nt=44: y=9, safe.\n\nNow, check all turns:\n\nt=34: y=0 safe\n\nt=35: y=0 safe\n\nt=36: y=1 safe (y1 unsafe only t=35)\n\nt=37: y=2 safe (y2 unsafe only t=34)\n\nt=38: y=3 safe (y3 unsafe only t=34)\n\nt=39: y=4 safe (y4 unsafe only t=36)\n\nt=40: y=5 safe (y5 unsafe only t=36)\n\nt=41: y=6 safe (y6 unsafe t=42,43, not 41)\n\nt=42: y=7, now at t=42, y=7 is safe because unsafe only up to t=36.\n\nt=43: y=8 safe (unsafe starts at t=50)\n\nt=44: y=9 safe\n\nSo we reached y=9 at t=44.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=34 to t=43, actions at t=34 to t=43, that's 10 actions? Let's see.\n\nStart at t=34, y=0.\n\nActions:\n\nt=34: S (stay)\n\nt=35: U (to y=1)\n\nt=36: U (to y=2)\n\nt=37: U (to y=3)\n\nt=38: U (to y=4)\n\nt=39: U (to y=5)\n\nt=40: U (to y=6)\n\nt=41: U (to y=7)\n\nt=42: U (to y=8)\n\nt=43: U (to y=9)\n\nAfter t=43 action U, y_44=9.\n\nSo we take actions from t=34 to t=43, that's 10 actions, H=10.\n\nBut at turn t=44, we are at y=9, but we don't take action there, since we have reached.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=t1 to t1+H-1, and after H actions, y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nt1=34, H=10, t1+H=44, y_44=9.\n\nActions: t=34 to t=43.\n\nIn the path above, we used one stay at beginning.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nMinimal without waiting: 9 actions to go from 0 to 9 in 9 steps, but at t=35, y=1 is unsafe, so we must avoid that.\n\nIf we go up immediately, we get stuck at t=35.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster by not staying at 0, but since we start at 0, and t=34 we can only go to 1 or stay.\n\nIf we go to 1 at t=35, but unsafe.\n\nSo we must stay at least one turn at start or something.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 is unsafe at early times, but we can go up to y=6 quickly, then wait if needed.\n\nIn the above, we reached at t=44 with one wait.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose at t=34, we stay: y_35=0\n\nThen t=35, we go U: y_36=1\n\nThen t=36, y=1, now at t=36, y=1 is safe, but y=4 and y=5 are unsafe at t=36.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=36 we are at y=1, which is fine.\n\nThen we go to y=2 at t=37, etc.\n\nAt t=36, if we were on y=4 or y=5, it would be unsafe, but we are not.\n\nNow, to reach earlier, suppose we go to y=1 later.\n\nBut we need to be on y=1 at some safe time.\n\ny=1 safe except t=35.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 safe after t=36.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=42,43, so we need to be on y=6 before t=42 or after t=43.\n\nIn the above path, at t=41 y=6, safe, then to y=7 at t=42.\n\nAt t=42 y=7, safe since t>36.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=43, safe.\n\nTo y=9 at t=44.\n\nCan we reach y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=6 earlier.\n\nBut y=6 is unsafe only at t=42,43, so at earlier times safe.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nThe constraint is at the beginning: we cannot be on y=1 at t=35.\n\nAlso, y=7 at t=34,35,36 unsafe.\n\nIn the min time, since we start at y=0, to go up, we need to pass y=1 at some point.\n\nEarliest we can be on y=1 is t=35 if we go up at t=34, but unsafe.\n\nNext is t=36: by staying at t=34, then up at t=35 to y=1 at t=36.\n\nThen from there, we can go up each turn.\n\nBut at t=36, if we go to y=2, y=2 is safe at t=37? Let's list the y_t:\n\nt=34: y=0\n\na=S, y_35=0\n\nt=35: y=0\n\na=U, y_36=1\n\nt=36: y=1\n\na=U, y_37=2\n\nt=37: y=2\n\na=U, y_38=3\n\nt=38: y=3\n\na=U, y_39=4\n\nt=39: y=4\n\na=U, y_40=5\n\nt=40: y=5\n\na=U, y_41=6\n\nt=41: y=6\n\na=U, y_42=7\n\nt=42: y=7\n\na=U, y_43=8\n\nt=43: y=8\n\na=U, y_44=9\n\nSame as before, t=44.\n\nAt t=39, y=4, which is safe only if not t=36, t=39>36, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut can we skip some or go faster?\n\nFor example, from t=36 y=1, if we go up to y=2 at t=37, etc.\n\nSuppose at t=34, instead of stay, we do something else, but only S or U, D not useful.\n\nSo must do S at t=34 or accept collision at t=35.\n\nNo other choice.\n\nPerhaps we can go to higher rows faster, but since we move one step per turn, not possible.\n\nAnother point: at t=42, y=6 would be unsafe, but in the path, at t=41 y=6, then to y=7 at t=42, so at t=42 we are on y=7, not y=6.\n\ny=6 at t=41 is safe.\n\nNow, y=8 unsafe at t=50-53, late, not issue.\n\nSo with H=10, we reach at t=44.\n\nBut is there a way with H=9?\n\nSuppose we start at t=34, y=0.\n\nIf we go U at t=34, y_35=1, but at t=35, y=1, unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we go U at t=34, we are forced to be on y=1 at t=35, unsafe.\n\nMust not be on y=1 at t=35.\n\nSo earliest we can be on y=1 is t=36.\n\nThen from y=1 at t=36, to y=9, min 8 more actions: to y=2 at t=37, y=3 at t=38, ..., y=9 at t=44.\n\ny_36=1\n\na=U, y_37=2\n\n...\n\ny_44=9\n\nAfter 8 actions from t=36 to t=43, y_44=9.\n\nBut at t=34, we need to get to y=1 at t=36.\n\nFrom t=34 to t=36: at t=34, we are at y=0.\n\nTo have y_36=1.\n\ny_36 depends on actions.\n\ny_35 = y_34 + Δy_34\n\ny_36 = y_35 + Δy_35\n\nIf at t=34, we do S, y_35=0\n\nThen at t=35, do U, y_36=1\n\nAs before.\n\nIf at t=34 do U, y_35=1, but then at t=35, we are on y=1, unsafe.\n\nThen y_36 could be 1,0, or 2, but if we stay, y_36=1, but at t=36, y=1 is safe, but we already collided at t=35.\n\nCollision at t=35, so not allowed.\n\nIf we go down, but y=0, D does nothing, y_36=1, same issue.\n\nSo only way is to stay at t=34, then go up at t=35 to be at y=1 at t=36.\n\nThus min time: start with S at t=34, then U every turn from t=35 to t=43, reaching y=9 at t=44.\n\nH=10 actions: t=34 to t=43.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe times for y=6 and y=7.\n\nIn the path, at t=41, y=6: y=6 unsafe at t=42,43, so at t=41 safe.\n\nAt t=42, y=7: y=7 unsafe at t=34,35,36, so at t=42 safe.\n\ny=8 at t=43 safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut in freeway 7, it has cars, and we are on y=7 at t=42, which is after unsafe period.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut we have freeway 3 and 2 same, but we didn't go through them at unsafe times.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=1 at t=36, safe; y=2 at t=37, safe since unsafe only t=34; etc.\n\ny=4 at t=39, safe.\n\nBut is there a problem with y=5 or something?\n\ny=5 unsafe at t=36, but we are on y=5 at t=40, safe.\n\nNow, but we used 10 turns, but perhaps we can save a turn by not going to y=6 early or something.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=6 after t=43.\n\nBut y=6 unsafe at t=42,43, so we can be on y=6 at t=41 or t=44, etc.\n\nIn the path, we are at y=6 at t=41, then move to y=7 at t=42.\n\nIf we stay on y=6 longer, it might be unsafe at t=42 or 43.\n\nFor example, if at t=41 we are at y=6, safe.\n\nIf we do S at t=41, then y_42=6, but at t=42, y=6 is unsafe, collision.\n\nSo we must leave y=6 before t=42.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be on y=6 at t=42 or 43.\n\nIn the path, we move to y=7 at t=42, so at t=42 we are not on y=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=41 we are on y=6, safe.\n\nIf we arrive earlier at y=6, we can leave earlier.\n\nBut in the sequence, we arrive at y=6 at t=41.\n\nCan we arrive earlier?\n\nFor example, from start.\n\nSuppose we go up faster initially, but we cannot because of t=35 issue.\n\nPerhaps stay less.\n\nAnother idea: at t=34, we stay, t=35 go to y=1.\n\nThen from t=36 y=1, we can go up faster, but we are already going up each turn.\n\nSuppose we skip some rows by going down, but that might take more time.\n\nFor example, go to y=1, then to y=2, but then down? Not useful.\n\nSo probably 10 is minimal.\n\nBut let's check if we can reach by t=43.\n\nIf y_43=9.\n\nThen y_42 must be 8 or 9, but if y_42=9, then reached earlier, but y_42=9 only if from y=8 with U.\n\nBut y_43=9, so at some point.\n\nTo have y_43=9, we need to be at y=8 at t=42 or something.\n\ny_43 = y_42 + Δy_42\n\nIf y_43=9, then y_42 must be 8 or 9, but if y_42=9, then we reached at t=42, but let's see the turn.\n\ny_t at turn t.\n\nAt turn t=43, y_43=9.\n\ny_43 depends on y_42 and action at t=42.\n\ny_43 = y_42 + Δy_42\n\nIf Δy_42 = U, y_43 = y_42 +1\n\nIf S, same, if D, minus.\n\nSo y_43=9 only if y_42=8 and U, or y_42=9 and S or U (but U does nothing).\n\nSimilarly, y_42=9 only if reached earlier.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=43, we need y_43=9.\n\nWhich requires y_42=8 and a_42=U, or y_42=9 and a_42=S, but y_42=9 means reached earlier.\n\nSo min, y_42=8 and a_42=U.\n\nThus we need to be at y=8 at t=42.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at t=42, need y_41=7 or 8, etc.\n\nNow, back to start.\n\nAt t=42, we need y=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=50-53, not issue.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=42.\n\ny_42 = y_41 + Δy_41\n\nIf y_41=7, then with U, y_42=8\n\nOr y_41=8, with S, y_42=8\n\nBut y_41=8 means earlier.\n\nSimilarly, min, y_41=7 with U.\n\nSimilarly, y_41=7, need from before.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=34,35,36, so at t=41 safe.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=41.\n\ny_41 = y_40 + Δy_40\n\nIf y_40=6, U, y_41=7\n\nOr etc.\n\nNow, y=6 unsafe at t=42,43, so at t=41, if we are on y=6, it must be safe, which it is, since t=41 not 42 or 43.\n\nt=41 <42, safe.\n\nThen from y=6 at t=41 to y=7 at t=42 with U? y_41=6, a_41=U, y_42=7\n\nThen a_42=U, y_43=8? But we need y_43=9.\n\ny_42=7, a_42=U, y_43=8\n\nThen we need another action to go to 9.\n\nTo have y_43=9, we need y_42=8, as above.\n\nBut if y_42=7, we go to y_43=8.\n\nThen y_44=9.\n\nSo cannot reach y=9 at t=43 if we are at y=7 at t=42? Let's see the sequence.\n\nSuppose we want y_43=9.\n\nThen at t=42, we must be at y=8, and take U.\n\nSo need y_42=8.\n\nThen to have y_42=8, need y_41=7 or 8, with appropriate action.\n\nSay y_41=7, a_41=U, y_42=8.\n\nThen y_41=7, need to be at y=7 at t=41.\n\ny_41=7, from y_40=6 or 7.\n\nSay y_40=6, a_40=U, y_41=7.\n\nNow, y_40=6, need at t=40, y=6.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=42,43, not t=40, safe.\n\nNow, to have y_40=6.\n\nWe need to reach y=6 by t=40.\n\nStart from t=34, y=0.\n\nTo go from y=0 to y=6 in 6 steps? From t=34 to t=40, that's 6 turns of actions? Let's see the indices.\n\nAt t=34, y=0.\n\nAfter k actions, y_{34+k} = ? \n\nAfter first action at t=34, y_35 set.\n\nAfter second at t=35, y_36, etc.\n\nAfter m actions, y_{34+m} is set.\n\ny_{34+m} depends on actions.\n\nTo have y_40 =6, that means after 6 actions from t=34 to t=39, y_40 is set.\n\nActions at t=34 to t=39 determine y_40.\n\ny_40 = y_34 + sum of Δy from t=34 to t=39.\n\ny_34=0.\n\nEach U: +1, S:0, D:-1 but not useful.\n\nSo to have y_40=6, we need exactly 6 U in the actions from t=34 to t=39, and no S or D, but we can have S, but if we have S, we need more U.\n\ny_40 = 0 + sum_{t=34 to 39} Δy_t\n\nEach Δy_t: U:1, S:0, D:-1\n\nSo y_40 = number of U minus number of D from t=34 to t=39.\n\nSince y_40=6, and we start from 0, and y<=9, so number of U - number of D =6.\n\nBut D not useful, so probably all U, or some S.\n\nBut if we have D, it would require more U to compensate, so worse, so best to have all U, but may not be possible due to cars.\n\nWith all U: actions at t=34 to t=39: all U, then y_35=1, y_36=2, y_37=3, y_38=4, y_39=5, y_40=6? Let's:\n\nt=34: a=U, y_35=1\n\nt=35: a=U, y_36=2\n\nt=36: a=U, y_37=3\n\nt=37: a=U, y_38=4\n\nt=38: a=U, y_39=5\n\nt=39: a=U, y_40=6\n\nYes, y_40=6.\n\nBut now, check safety:\n\nt=34: y=0 safe\n\nt=35: y=1, unsafe! t=35, y=1 unsafe, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf we have some S or delay.\n\nBut to reach y=6 at t=40, we need to be at lower rows at safe times.\n\nFor example, to avoid being on y=1 at t=35.\n\nSo we must not go to y=1 at t=35.\n\nThus, at t=34, we cannot do U, must do S or something else.\n\nIf S at t=34, y_35=0\n\nThen at t=35, we can do U, y_36=1\n\nThen at t=36, we can do U, y_37=2\n\nt=37: U, y_38=3\n\nt=38: U, y_39=4\n\nt=39: U, y_40=5\n\ny_40=5, not 6.\n\nWith actions:\n\nt=34: S, y_35=0\n\nt=35: U, y_36=1\n\nt=36: U, y_37=2\n\nt=37: U, y_38=3\n\nt=38: U, y_39=4\n\nt=39: U, y_40=5\n\nSo y_40=5, not 6.\n\nTo have y_40=6, we need one more U.\n\nBut at t=34, if we do U, we have problem.\n\nSuppose at t=34, we do U, but then at t=35, y=1 unsafe, cannot.\n\nPerhaps from other actions.\n\nFor example, at t=36, if we do U to y=2, but we are at y=1 at t=36.\n\nTo increase faster, but we can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nSo from t=34 to t=39, we have 6 actions: t=34,35,36,37,38,39.\n\ny_40 depends on these 6 actions.\n\ny_40 = 0 + sum Δy from t=34 to 39.\n\nMax y_40=6 if all U, but not possible.\n\nIf we have one S, then y_40=5, etc.\n\nSo impossible to have y_40=6 without being on y=1 at t=35 or other conflict.\n\nThus, cannot reach y=6 at t=40.\n\nEarliest y=6 is at t=41: with the sequence: t=34 S, t=35 U (y_36=1), t=36 U (y_37=2), ..., up to t=40 U (y_41=6)\n\ny_41=6.\n\nThen as before.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=43, we need y_43=9, so y_42=8.\n\nThen y_41=7 or 8.\n\nIf y_41=7, then a_41=U to y_42=8.\n\nBut y_41=7, at t=41, y=7 safe.\n\nHow to reach y=7 at t=41.\n\nSimilar to before, from start, with actions to have y_41=7.\n\ny_41 = y_34 + sum Δy t=34 to 40? Actions from t=34 to t=40 determine y_41.\n\n7 actions.\n\ny_41 = 0 + sum_{t=34 to 40} Δy_t\n\nTo have y_41=7, need sum Δy =7 over 7 actions, so all U, no S.\n\nThen sequence: t=34 U, y_35=1 (but unsafe)\n\nt=35 U, y_36=2\n\nt=36 U, y_37=3\n\nt=37 U, y_38=4\n\nt=38 U, y_39=5\n\nt=39 U, y_40=6\n\nt=40 U, y_41=7\n\nBut at t=35, y=1 unsafe, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nWith S: but if one S, then y_41=6, not 7.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=7 at t=41.\n\nThus, cannot reach y=9 at t=43.\n\nTherefore, minimal is at t=44 with H=10.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have one S at start.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nIn the initial sequence I thought, with S at t=34, then U all to t=43.\n\nBut at t=43, action U to y=9.\n\nNow, but we have freeway 4 and 5 unsafe at t=36, but in the path, we are not on them at t=36.\n\ny=4 at t=39, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid the stay if we go to other rows, but since all rows must be traversed, and the constraints are symmetric except for the unsafe times.\n\nAnother point: freeway 7 is unsafe from t=34 to 36, but we are on it at t=42, fine.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, at t=41, we are on y=6, which is freeway 6, unsafe at t=42,43, but t=41 safe.\n\nThen we move to y=7 at t=42.\n\nNow, but freeway 6 has cars, but at t=41, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can have a different path where we reach faster by taking advantage of multiple lanes, but since we have to go through each y, and move sequentially, I think not possible.\n\nFor example, from y=0 to y=1 must be done, and so on.\n\nSo I think H=10 is minimal.\n\nThus, the action sequence:\n\nTurn t_1: S  (since t1=34, a_{34}=S)\n\nThen Turn t_1 +1: U  (t=35, a_{35}=U)\n\nThen Turn t_1 +2: U  (t=36, a_{36}=U)\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 +9: U  (t=43, a_{43}=U)\n\nt1=34, actions from t=34 to t=43, 10 actions.\n\na_{34} to a_{43}\n\nIn the sequence: t=34: S\n\nt=35: U\n\nt=36: U\n\nt=37: U\n\nt=38: U\n\nt=39: U\n\nt=40: U\n\nt=41: U\n\nt=42: U\n\nt=43: U\n\nAfter a_{43}, y_{44}=9.\n\nNow, to write in the answer format.\n\nThe turn is absolute, but in the output, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so with t_1=34.\n\nBut in the box, we just write the actions with the turn labels.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 3 is same as 2, but we didn't go through issue.\n\nNow, but in the beginning, at t=34, we did S, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps we can go up immediately if we could, but cannot.\n\nAnother thought: the collision note says that if you move to a new y at turn T, you are not on that new y until next turn, so at turn T, you are on old y.\n\nIn this case, when we move, no issue.\n\nIn our sequence, all safe.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nThus minimal H=10.\n\nNow, output the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, for freeway 2 and 3, they are unsafe at t=34, but at t=34, we are on y=0, not on freeway, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, the actions:\n\nTurn 34: S\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nIn the answer format, it should be in terms of t_1.\n\nt_1=34.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t_1: S\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 + 9: U\n\nt from t1 to t1+9, that's 10 turns.\n\nt1, t1+1, ..., t1+9.\n\nActions at these turns.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the reaching: after last action at t=43, y_{44}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence with less than 10 actions? But from above, seems not.\n\nAnother idea: what if at some point we go down to avoid, but that would take more turns, not less.\n\nFor example, from y=0, go up to y=1 at t=35, but unsafe, so not possible.\n\nOr, stay at y=0 for multiple turns, but that increases H.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H=10.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 34\\) is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by waiting at \\(y = 0\\) for one turn to bypass the unsafe condition on \\(y = 1\\) at turn 35, and then moving up consistently. The unsafe times for each freeway are as follows:\n- \\(y = 1\\): unsafe only at turn 35\n- \\(y = 2\\): unsafe only at turn 34\n- \\(y = 3\\): unsafe only at turn 34\n- \\(y = 4\\): unsafe only at turn 36\n- \\(y = 5\\): unsafe only at turn 36\n- \\(y = 6\\): unsafe at turns 42 and 43\n- \\(y = 7\\): unsafe at turns 34, 35, and 36\n- \\(y = 8\\): unsafe at turns 50 to 53\n\nThe sequence ensures that the player is not on any freeway during its unsafe times. Specifically:\n- At turn 34, staying at \\(y = 0\\) avoids the unsafe conditions on \\(y = 2\\) and \\(y = 3\\) at turn 34 and \\(y = 7\\) from turns 34 to 36.\n- Moving to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 36 avoids the unsafe condition on \\(y = 1\\) at turn 35.\n- The path progresses upward, reaching \\(y = 6\\) at turn 41 (before the unsafe turns 42 and 43) and \\(y = 7\\) at turn 42 (after the unsafe period up to turn 36).\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- At turn \\(t_1 = 34\\), action \\(S\\) (stay) keeps the player at \\(y = 0\\), safe.\n- At turn \\(t_1 + 1 = 35\\), action \\(U\\) (up) moves to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 36.\n- From turns \\(t_1 + 2 = 36\\) to \\(t_1 + 9 = 43\\), actions \\(U\\) (up) move the player upward by one unit each turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 44.\n\nAfter 10 actions, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 44, with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 34: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 39: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 40: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 41: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 42: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 43: U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The current turn is t1 = 35, and I'm at y=0. I need to output a sequence of actions starting from turn 35.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each future turn and how they move. Since the cars move at constant speeds, I can compute their positions relative to x=0 at any turn T.\n\nThe collision occurs if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y=k (for k=1 to 8), and for some car on that freeway, 0 is within its span at that turn. Also, when I move to a new row, I'm not considered on that row until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe player position updates at the same time as the cars, I think. Let me read carefully.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, based on action at time t.\n\nCar update: for a car, at turn T, span is based on initial span at t1 and speed.\n\nThe car state is given at turn t1=35. So for any turn T, the span of a car can be calculated.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t1 = T - 35.\n\nFor a left-moving car, span at T is [h - s * Δt, τ - s * Δt], but since it's left-moving, h and τ are such that the car moves left, so decreasing x.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, it says span(t1) = [h, τ] and then at T, [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]. I need to know which one is head and tail.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h]? Let's see:\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nIn both cases, the span is given as [min, max] I think, but for left-moving, at t1, [h, τ] with h and τ such that it might not be min max, but since it's moving left, h is the head, which is larger x, I assume.\n\nI think it's better to think in terms of the position of the car.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, if I'm on freeway y=k, and for a car on that freeway, 0 is in [min, max] of the span at T.\n\nThe min and max depend on the direction.\n\nFor a left-moving car, span at T is [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]. Since it's moving left, the head h is at higher x, so at t1, the car occupies from τ to h, with τ < h, I assume? The notation says \"head at h, tail at τ\", but it doesn't specify which is larger.\n\nFor left-moving: \"head at h, tail at τ\", and span [h, τ]. If it's moving left, head should be on the right, so h > τ, so [h, τ] would be from high to low, but typically we write intervals with min first.\n\nThis might be confusing. Let me look at the values.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: car (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-47, 0]? Because τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nAnd collision if 0 in span(T) for the freeway I'm on at turn T.\n\nAlso, the freeway has multiple cars, so I need to check all cars on that row.\n\nNow, I'm at y=0 at turn 35. y=0 is not a freeway with cars; the freeways are y=1 to 8, so I start on y=0, which is safe, I think, no cars there.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is also not a freeway, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which might be the end, no cars.\n\nNow, actions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same). But y in [0,9], so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nSince I start at 0 and need to go to 9, I probably want to go up, but I have to avoid the cars on rows 1-8 at the times I'm there.\n\nEach move takes one turn, so to go from 0 to 9, minimum turns is 9, if I go up every turn, but I might have to wait or something to avoid cars.\n\nI need to find a sequence where for each turn, when I'm on a freeway row, there is no car covering x=0 at that time.\n\nAlso, when I move, at the turn I move, I'm still on the previous row.\n\nLet me list all the cars on each freeway at t1=35.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): one car: (head h=0, tail τ=-47, direction right, speed s=48)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-47, 0]\n\nAt turn T, span(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-47 + 48 Δt, 0 + 48 Δt] = [48Δt - 47, 48Δt]\n\nCollision on y=1 if I'm there at turn T and 0 in [48Δt - 47, 48Δt]\n\nSince it's a closed interval, I think.\n\nNow, freeway 2 (y=2): two cars: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12)\n\nFirst car: direction right, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [49,60]? τ=49, h=60, so [49,60]\n\nAt T, [49 + 12 Δt, 60 + 12 Δt]\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12), span(t1) = [τ,h] = [1,12]\n\nAt T, [1 + 12 Δt, 12 + 12 Δt]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 (y=3): same as y=2? (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12), so identical to y=2.\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): (12,47,left,36) — direction left.\n\nFor left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] = [12,47]? h=12, τ=47? It says head h, tail τ.\n\nIf moving left, head is on the left or right? Moving left, so head should be on the right, I think, but let's see the span.\n\nFor left-moving: \"span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\"\n\nHere h=12, τ=47, so if moving left, head at h=12, tail at τ=47? That seems odd because if head is at 12 and tail at 47, and moving left, tail should be left of head? I think there might be confusion.\n\nPerhaps head is the front, so for left-moving, front is left, so smaller x.\n\nAssume x increases to the right.\n\nLeft-moving car: moving to the left, so front/head is on the left, so smaller x, tail on right, larger x.\n\nFor example, car at position, say head at x=10, tail at x=20, moving left, so at next turn, head at 10-s, tail at 20-s.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, \"head at h, tail at τ\", and span [h, τ], which should be from smaller to larger if h < τ.\n\nIn freeway 4: (12,47,left,36), so h=12, τ=47, and since left-moving, head at 12, tail at 47, so span [12,47], and moving left, so at T, [12 - 36 Δt, 47 - 36 Δt]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 (y=5): same as y=4, (12,47,left,36)\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): (-42,-53,right,6) — direction right.\n\nspan(t1) = [τ,h] = [-53,-42]? τ=-53, h=-42, so [-53,-42]\n\nAt T, [ -53 + 6 Δt, -42 + 6 Δt]\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): two cars: (52,41,right,4) and (4,-7,right,4)\n\nFirst car: (52,41,right,4), span(t1) = [τ,h] = [41,52]\n\nAt T, [41 + 4 Δt, 52 + 4 Δt]\n\nSecond car: (4,-7,right,4), span(t1) = [τ,h] = [-7,4]\n\nAt T, [-7 + 4 Δt, 4 + 4 Δt]\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): (-45,-56,right,3), span(t1) = [τ,h] = [-56,-45]\n\nAt T, [-56 + 3 Δt, -45 + 3 Δt]\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when x=0 is covered by a car, i.e., when 0 is in the span for that car at turn T.\n\nThen, for that freeway, at time T, it is unsafe if any car covers 0.\n\nI need to be on the freeway only when it is safe.\n\nΔt = T - 35.\n\nLet me find for each row, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when 0 is covered.\n\nStart with y=1: only one car, span at T: [48Δt - 47, 48Δt]\n\n0 in [48Δt -47, 48Δt] if 48Δt -47 <= 0 <= 48Δt\n\nSo 48Δt -47 <= 0 and 0 <= 48Δt, so 48Δt <= 47 and 48Δt >=0\n\nSince Δt >=0, 48Δt >=0 always true for Δt>=0.\n\nSo 48Δt <= 47, so Δt <= 47/48 = 0.979, so since Δt integer, Δt <=0, so only at Δt=0, 48*0 -47 = -47 <=0 <=0, yes 0<=0 true.\n\nAt Δt=0, T=35, span [ -47, 0], 0 is included.\n\nBut at turn T=35, I am at y=0, not on y=1, so for y=1, at T=35, it is unsafe, but I'm not there.\n\nFor Δt=1, T=36, span [48*1 -47, 48*1] = [1,48], 0 not in [1,48], so safe.\n\nSimilarly for other Δt, 48Δt -47 and 48Δt both positive and larger, so 0 not covered.\n\nSo for y=1, unsafe only at T=35, but since I'm not on it at T=35, it is safe for all T when I might be on it.\n\nNow y=2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: [49 + 12 Δt, 60 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in this if 49 +12Δt <=0 <=60+12Δt, but 49+12Δt >=49>0, so 0 <=60+12Δt always true, but 49+12Δt <=0 false since 49+12Δt >=49>0, so 0 not in this interval. So first car never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: [1 + 12 Δt, 12 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in this if 1+12Δt <=0 <=12+12Δt\n\n1+12Δt <=0 implies 12Δt <= -1, Δt <= -1/12, not possible since Δt>=0.\n\n0 <=12+12Δt always true.\n\nSo 1+12Δt <=0 false, so 0 not in interval. Thus both cars on y=2 never cover 0, so y=2 is always safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 same as y=2, always safe.\n\nNow y=4: one car, left-moving: h=12, τ=47, s=36, left.\n\nSpan at T: [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] = [12 - 36 Δt, 47 - 36 Δt]\n\n0 in this if 12 -36Δt <= 0 <= 47 -36Δt\n\nWhich is 12 -36Δt <=0 and 0 <=47 -36Δt\n\nFirst: 12 -36Δt <=0 => 12 <=36Δt => Δt >= 12/36 = 1/3\n\nSecond: 0 <=47 -36Δt => 36Δt <=47 => Δt <=47/36 ≈1.305\n\nSo for Δt integer, Δt=1 or Δt=2? Δt >=1/3 and Δt <=1.305, so Δt=1.\n\nCheck:\n\nΔt=1: [12-36, 47-36] = [-24, 11], 0 in [-24,11]? -24<=0<=11, yes.\n\nΔt=2: [12-72, 47-72] = [-60, -25], 0 not in [-60,-25], both negative.\n\nΔt=0: [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at Δt=1, T=36, 0 in span, so unsafe at T=36.\n\nOther times safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=5, same as y=4, unsafe only at T=36.\n\nNow y=6: one car, right-moving: (-42,-53,right,6), so τ=-53, h=-42, span(t1)= [τ,h] = [-53,-42]\n\nAt T: [-53 +6 Δt, -42 +6 Δt]\n\n0 in this if -53+6Δt <=0 <= -42+6Δt\n\nFirst: -53+6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=53 => Δt <=53/6≈8.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -42+6Δt => 42 <=6Δt => Δt >=42/6=7\n\nSo Δt >=7 and Δt <=8.833, so Δt=7 or 8.\n\nΔt=7: [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11, 0], 0 in [-11,0]? -11<=0<=0, yes 0<=0.\n\nΔt=8: [-53+48, -42+48] = [-5,6], 0 in [-5,6]? -5<=0<=6, yes.\n\nΔt=9: [-53+54, -42+54] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe at T=35+7=42 and T=35+8=43.\n\nNow y=7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (52,41,right,4) span [41 +4 Δt, 52 +4 Δt]\n\n0 in? 41+4Δt <=0 <=52+4Δt? 41+4Δt >=41>0, so 0 <=52+4Δt true but 41+4Δt <=0 false, so never.\n\nSecond car: (4,-7,right,4) span [-7 +4 Δt, 4 +4 Δt]\n\n0 in if -7+4Δt <=0 <=4+4Δt\n\nFirst: -7+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=7 => Δt <=7/4=1.75\n\nSecond: 0 <=4+4Δt always true for Δt>=0.\n\nSo -7+4Δt <=0 and 0 <=4+4Δt, but 0 <=4+4Δt always, so only need -7+4Δt <=0, i.e., Δt <=1.75, so Δt=0,1\n\nΔt=0: [-7,4], 0 in [-7,4]? -7<=0<=4, yes.\n\nΔt=1: [-7+4,4+4]=[-3,8], 0 in [-3,8], yes.\n\nΔt=2: [-7+8,4+8]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe at T=35 and T=36 for second car.\n\nFirst car never unsafe, so y=7 unsafe at T=35 and T=36.\n\nNow y=8: one car, (-45,-56,right,3) span [ -56 +3 Δt, -45 +3 Δt]\n\n0 in if -56+3Δt <=0 <= -45+3Δt\n\nFirst: -56+3Δt <=0 => 3Δt <=56 => Δt <=56/3≈18.666\n\nSecond: 0 <= -45+3Δt => 45 <=3Δt => Δt >=15\n\nSo Δt >=15 and Δt <=18.666, so Δt=15,16,17,18.\n\nT=35+15=50, 35+16=51, 35+17=52, 35+18=53.\n\nNow summarize for each row, unsafe times:\n\ny=1: unsafe only at T=35, but since we start at T=35 on y=0, not issue.

T=39.\n\ny=4 unsafe only at T=36, so at T=39, it is safe.\n\nThen a_{38}=U, y_{39}=4\n\nThen at t=39, y=4, safe, a_{39}=U, y_{40}=5\n\nt=40, y=5, safe (since unsafe only at 36)\n\na_{40}=U, y_{41}=6\n\nt=41, y=6, now y=6 unsafe at T=42,43, so at T=41, is it safe?\n\ny=6 unsafe at T=42 and 43, so at T=41, should be safe.\n\nThen at t=41, y=6, I need to take action.\n\nIf I go up, a_{41}=U, y_{42}=7\n\nBut at t=42, y=7, and y=7 is unsafe at T=42? y=7 unsafe at T=35 and 36, but not at T=42.\n\nT=42, Δt=42-35=7\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=35 and 36, so for T=42, safe.\n\nThen y_{42}=7, which is safe.\n\nThen a_{41}=U, y_{42}=7\n\nAt t=42, y=7, safe, a_{42}=U, y_{43}=8\n\nNow t=43, y=8, but y=8 unsafe at T=50-53, T=43 is 43-35=8, not in 15-18, so safe.\n\nThen a_{42}=U, y_{43}=8\n\nt=43, y=8, safe, a_{43}=U, y_{44}=9\n\nThen at t=44, y=9, done.\n\nBut I arrived at y=9 at turn 44, with actions from t=35 to t=43, that's 9 actions: t=35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43.\n\nH=9 turns of actions.\n\ny_{44} =9.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nt=35: a=U, to y=1 at t=36\n\nt=36: at y=1, safe, a=U to y=2 at t=37\n\nt=37: y=2, a=U to y=3 at t=38\n\nt=38: y=3, a=U to y=4 at t=39\n\nt=39: y=4, safe (T=39≠36), a=U to y=5 at t=40\n\nt=40: y=5, safe (T=40≠36), a=U to y=6 at t=41\n\nt=41: y=6, now T=41, y=6 unsafe at T=42,43, but T=41 is safe, so I can be here.\n\na_{41}=U, to y=7 at t=42\n\nt=42: y=7, T=42, y=7 unsafe only at T=35,36, so T=42 safe.\n\na_{42}=U to y=8 at t=43\n\nt=43: y=8, T=43, y=8 unsafe at T=50-53, T=43=35+8, Δt=8, not in 15-18, safe.\n\na_{43}=U to y=9 at t=44.\n\nNow, at t=44, y=9, done. Actions from t=35 to t=43, 9 actions.\n\nBut is there any issue? At t=42, y=7, safe, but y=6 at t=41 is safe, but when I go to y=7 at t=42, it's fine.\n\ny=6 is unsafe at T=42 and 43, but in this sequence, I am on y=6 only at t=41, which is before 42, so safe.\n\nAnd at t=42, I am on y=7, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nBut I need to check if at any point I am on unsafe row at unsafe time.\n\nIn this case, all good.\n\nBut y=8 unsafe at T=50-53, which is later, not relevant here.\n\nSo with H=9, I can reach.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=9 is the minimum possible since I need to increase y by 9, each U increases by 1, so at least 9 U actions, and no S or D, so H=9 is minimum.\n\nIn this sequence, I used all U, no S or D.\n\nAnd it seems safe.\n\nBut let me double-check the times.\n\nt=35: y=0\n\nAfter a=U, y_{36}=1\n\nt=36: y=1, which is safe? y=1 unsafe only at T=35, but T=36, safe.\n\nThen to y=2 at t=37, safe.\n\ny=3 at t=38, safe.\n\ny=4 at t=39: T=39, Δt=4, y=4 span: [12 -36*4, 47-36*4] = [12-144,47-144]=[-132,-97], 0 not in, safe.\n\ny=5 at t=40: similarly [12-36*5,47-36*5]=[12-180,47-180]=[-168,-133], 0 not in, safe.\n\ny=6 at t=41: T=41, Δt=6, y=6 car: [-53 +6*6, -42 +6*6] = [-53+36, -42+36]=[-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen a=U to y=7 at t=42\n\nt=42: y=7, Δt=7, y=7 cars: first car [41+4*7,52+4*7]=[41+28,52+28]=[69,80], no\n\nSecond car: [-7+4*7, 4+4*7]=[-7+28,4+28]=[21,32], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen a=U to y=8 at t=43\n\nt=43: y=8, Δt=8, car: [-56+3*8, -45+3*8]=[-56+24,-45+24]=[-32,-21], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen a=U to y=9 at t=44.\n\nPerfect.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I did in 9 turns.\n\nBut is there a reason I need to wait? For example, y=6 is unsafe at T=42,43, but in this sequence, I am not on y=6 at those times; at T=42 I am on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier? But with all U, I reach at t=44, which is turn 44.\n\nt=35 to t=43 actions, t=44 position.\n\nSince I start at t=35 y=0, and after 9 actions, at t=44 y=9, that seems minimum.\n\nBut let me confirm the answer format.\n\nI need to output the actions starting from turn 35.\n\nIn the sequence above, actions are:\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 43: U\n\nBut turn 43 action sets y_{44}=9.\n\nNow, the player reaches at turn 44.\n\nBut the turn when position is 9 is turn 44.\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nt1=35, so t1 + H -1 =35 + H -1\n\nSet this to be the turn when y=9.\n\nIn my case, at turn 44, y=9, so 35 + H -1 =44, so 34 + H =44, H=10? Inconsistency.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nThe sequence of actions: {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1\n\nAfter these actions, the position is at turn (t1 + H)\n\nBecause after action at t, position y_{t+1}.\n\nStart: at turn t1, position y_{t1} =0\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H -1}, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nLet me read:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nIn the text: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nBut at turn t1 + H -1, position is y_{t1 + H -1}\n\nAfter actions up to a_{t1 + H -2}, we have y_{t1 + H -1}\n\nThe last action is a_{t1 + H -1}, which sets y_{t1 + H}\n\nSo to have position at turn t1 + H -1 be (0,9), that means y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThen at that turn, we are already at 9, so we don't need to take action if we are already there? But the sequence includes actions to reach.\n\nPerhaps I misinterpret.\n\nRead carefully:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that after taking these actions, the player is at (0,9), meaning at turn t1 + H, y_{t1 + H} =9.\"\n\nBut the text says: \"to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nIn the user message: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd in the answer format, it shows actions from turn t1 to turn t1 + something.\n\nPerhaps it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nLook: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\"\n\nIn the text: \"minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\"\n\nAnd the actions are from t=0 to H-1 for the index, so actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter taking these actions, the position at turn t1 + H is set, but we want position at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, we are at position y_{t1 + H -1}, and we take action a_{t1 + H -1} which affects y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9, meaning that at turn t1 + H -1, we are already at 9, and the action at that turn might be S, but since we are at 9, we can stay or something.\n\nTo reach exactly at that turn.\n\nFor example, if I want to be at y=9 at turn T, then at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nThe actions before that determine how I get there.\n\nIn this case, for turn T, y_T=9, which is achieved by actions up to a_{T-1}, which sets y_T.\n\nBut y_T is at turn T.\n\nNow, in the sequence, actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo at turn t1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nThat means that the actions from t1 to t1+H-2 set the position to y_{t1 + H -1}, and at that turn, we take action a_{t1 + H -1}, which sets y_{t1 + H}, but since we are already at 9, a_{t1 + H -1} could be S, or U/D but y capped, but if y=9, U would not change, similarly D from 0 not change.\n\nBut in terms of position, at turn t1 + H -1, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn my earlier plan, I reached at turn 44, which is t1 +9 since t1=35, 35+9=44.\n\nSo y_{44} =9.\n\nNow, to have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so 35 + H -1 =44, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen turn when position is 9 is turn 44 = t1 + H -1 =35 +10 -1=44, yes.\n\nActions from t=35 to t=35+9=44? t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nIf H=10, actions at t=35 to 44.\n\nBut at turn 44, I take action, but position at turn 44 is y_{44}, which should be 9, but when I take action at turn 44, it sets y_{45}, but I want y_{44}=9.\n\nSo to have y_{44}=9, I need to have arrived at turn 44 by action at turn 43.\n\nSo the action at turn 43 sets y_{44}=9.\n\nThen at turn 44, I am at y=9, and I might take an action, but since I am already at 9, I can take S, for example.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 44, I take action, but it doesn't change position if I stay.\n\nBut the position at turn 44 is already 9 before taking action.\n\nIn terms of the state, at the beginning of turn t, I am at y_t, then I take action a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, position is y_t before action.\n\nAfter action, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nWe want at some turn, y_t =9 for t = t1 + H -1.\n\nIn my case, y_{44} =9, so t=44 = t1 + H -1 =35 + H -1, so 35 + H -1 =44, thus H=10.\n\nThen actions from t=35 to t=44, but I need to reach y=9 at turn 44, so by action at turn 43, y_{44} should be set to 9.\n\nThen at turn 44, I am at y=9, and I take action a_{44}, which could be S, for example, since I am at 9.\n\nBut the position is already 9 at turn 44.\n\nIn the sequence, I have to specify actions up to turn 44.\n\nBut in terms of minimal H, since I need to increase y, with H actions, the net increase must be 9, so if I use all U, H=9 actions to go from 0 to 9, arriving at turn 39? Let's think.\n\nStart t=35, y=0.\n\nAfter a_{35}, y_{36} =0 + Δy\n\nAfter a_{36}, y_{37} = y_{36} + Δy, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, y_{35+k} = 0 + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} Δy_{35+i}\n\nSet y_{35+k} =9.\n\nThe sum of Δy over the actions must be 9.\n\nEach Δy is +1, -1, or 0.\n\nMinimum H such that sum of H actions is 9, so if all U, H=9, y_{35+9} = y_{44} =9.\n\nIf I have S or D, H larger.\n\nSo minimal H is 9, with all U.\n\nThen at turn 44, y=9.\n\nAnd turn t1 + H -1 =35 +9 -1=44, yes, y_{44}=9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =35+9-1=44.\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1, so t=35 to 35+8=43? Index t from 0 to H-1.\n\nActions: a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for H=9, actions at t1 +0 to t1+8, i.e., turns 35 to 43.\n\nAfter these, at turn t1 + H =35+9=44, position y_{44}=9.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{44} for H=9? t1 + H -1=35+9-1=43.\n\ny_{43} should be 9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nI think I confused the indices.\n\nDefine:\n\nLet the actions be taken at turns: T_act = t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1\n\nAfter action at T_act, the position at turn T_act +1 is set.\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t.\n\nAt turn t1, y_{t1} = initial position.\n\nAction at t1 sets y_{t1+1}\n\nAction at t1+1 sets y_{t1+2}\n\n...\n\nAction at t1+H-1 sets y_{t1+H}\n\nWe want that at turn t1 + H -1, y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nBut y_{t1 + H -1} is determined by actions up to a_{t1 + H -2}, which sets y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H -1, we are at y=9, and we take action a_{t1 + H -1}, which sets y_{t1 + H}, which could be 9 or 10, but since y=9, U does nothing, etc.\n\nBut the position at turn t1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nIn terms of reaching, we are at 9 at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at turn 44, then t1 + H -1 =44, t1=35, so 35 + H -1 =44, H=10.\n\nThen actions from t=35 to 44.\n\nWith a_{35} to a_{44}, but to be at y=9 at turn 44, that means y_{44} =9, which is set by a_{43}.\n\nThen at turn 44, we are at y=9, and we take a_{44}, which might be S, for example.\n\nBut the net increase: from y_{35}=0 to y_{44}=9, so over 9 steps (from t=35 to t=44, 9 actions: a35 to a43 set y36 to y44, 9 positions? From y36 to y44, that's 8 intervals? Let's count.\n\nAt turn 35, y35=0\n\nAfter a35, y36 = y35 + Δy35\n\nAfter a36, y37 = y36 + Δy36\n\n...\n\nAfter a43, y44 = y43 + Δy43\n\nWe want y44 =9 for the position at turn 44, but we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor turn t1 + H -1.\n\nSet t = t1 + H -1, y_t =9.\n\nt = t1 + H -1\n\ny_t =9.\n\ny_t is determined by actions up to a_{t-1}, which sets y_t.\n\nThen at turn t, we take action a_t, but for the sequence, we include a_t.\n\nIn the sequence for H, actions from t1 to t1+H-1, which includes a_t for t= t1 + H -1.\n\nBut at that turn, we are already at y=9.\n\nTo have y_t =9 at t= t1 + H -1, with minimal H.\n\nSince we start at y=0 at t1, we need to increase y by 9 in the steps from t1 to t.\n\nThe number of actions from a_{t1} to a_{t-1} that set the position.\n\nFrom turn t1 to turn t, there are (t - t1) actions that affect the position from y_{t1} to y_t.\n\nSpecifically, actions a_{t1} to a_{t-1} determine y_t.\n\nThere are (t - t1) actions.\n\ny_t = y_{t1} + sum_{k=t1}^{t-1} Δy_k\n\nSet y_t =9, y_{t1}=0, so sum from k=t1 to t-1 of Δy_k =9.\n\nEach Δy_k >= -1, so minimum number of actions is 9, all U.\n\nThen t - t1 =9, so t = t1 +9.\n\nThen y_t =9 at t= t1+9.\n\nNow, t = t1 + H -1, so t1 + H -1 = t1 +9, thus H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen actions from t1 to t1+9, i.e., turns 35 to 44.\n\nBut for those actions, a_{t1} to a_{t1+9-1} = a_{35} to a_{44}.\n\nWith all U except the last action at turn 44, since we are at y=9, we can take S or U, but U would try to go to 10, but y capped at 9, so y stays 9.\n\nSimilarly, S stays.\n\nBut to be precise, the position at turn 44 is y44=9, set by a43.\n\nThen at turn 44, we take a44, which sets y45, but since we want to be at 9 at turn 44, and the action at 44 is part of the sequence, but it doesn't change the position if we are at boundary.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, for the path, we need to have y44=9, which is achieved by actions a35 to a43 all U.\n\nThen at turn 44, we are at y=9, and we take a44, which can be S, for example.\n\nBut in the output, we need to specify a44 as well.\n\nWith H=10 actions.\n\nBut earlier with 9 actions, I can be at y9 at turn 44, but with H=9 actions, I am at turn 44 after actions, but the position at turn t1+H-1=35+9-1=43 is y43, which might not be 9.\n\nIn my first sequence, with 9 actions U from t35 to t43, I have y36=1, y37=2, ..., y44=9.\n\nSo at turn 44, y=9.\n\nBut turn t1+H-1=35+9-1=43, y43=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y43=9, for example, I need to arrive earlier.\n\nBut I start at 0, so to be at 9 at turn 43, I need to have increased faster, but I can only increase by at most 1 per action, so earliest at turn 44.\n\ny35=0\n\nAfter one action, y36 <=1\n\nAfter two, y37 <=2\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, y_{35+k} <= k\n\nSet y_{35+k} =9, so k>=9, so y_{44} >=9, but since y<=9, y_{44}=9 possible with k=9 actions.\n\ny_{35+9}=y44=9.\n\nTo have y_{43}=9, that would require after 8 actions, y_{43}=y_{35+8}=8 or less, cannot be 9 since maximum y43=8 if all U from start.\n\ny35=0\n\na35: y36=1\n\na36: y37=2\n\n...\n\na42: y43=8\n\na43: y44=9\n\nSo y43=8, cannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, y_{t1 + H -1} at H-1 steps from t1.\n\nFrom turn t1 to turn t1 + H -1, there are (H-1) actions that determine y_{t1 + H -1} from y_{t1}.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} = y_{t1} + sum of Δy from t=t1 to t1 + H -2\n\nSet this to 9.\n\nWith y_{t1}=0, so sum of H-1 actions must be 9.\n\nMinimum H-1=9, so H=10, with all U in the first 9 actions, but the actions are from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nFor example, H=10, actions at t=35 to 44.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} = y_{35+10-1} = y_{44}\n\nWe want y_{44}=9.\n\ny_{44} is set by a_{43}.\n\nThen a_{43} must be U or something, but with previous actions.\n\nTo have y_{44}=9, we need the sum from k=35 to 43 of Δy_k =9, since y44 = y35 + sum_{k=35}^{43} Δy_k\n\ny35=0, y44=9, so sum_{k=35}^{43} Δy_k =9\n\n9 actions: a35 to a43.\n\nThen at turn 44, we take a44, but y44 is already set to 9.\n\nThen a44 sets y45, but we don't care.\n\nFor the position at turn 44 to be 9, it is set by a43.\n\nIn the sequence, with H=10 actions, including a44.\n\nBut a44 is not necessary for reaching y44=9.\n\nThe minimal H to have y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith t1 + H -1 = t, y_t=9.\n\nt - t1 = H -1\n\ny_t =9, which requires t - t1 >=9, so H-1 >=9, H>=10.\n\nWith H=10, t= t1 +9 =44, y44=9.\n\nActions from t=35 to 44, 10 actions.\n\nThe first 9 actions can be U to increase y to 9 at turn 44, and the last action at turn 44 can be S, for example.\n\nIn terms of the path, it's the same as before, but with an extra S at the end.\n\nBut for collision, during the path, it should be fine.\n\nIn my first sequence, with actions from t35 to t43 all U, I reach y44=9, and during the path, no collision.\n\nIf I must have y_{t1 + H -1} =9 with H minimal, then H=10, and y_{44}=9.\n\nThen actions: a35 to a43: U, and a44: S, for example.\n\nBut the position is reached at turn 44 with the first 9 actions.\n\nThe last action is redundant but necessary for the sequence.\n\nFor the car avoidance, since at turn 44 I am on y=9, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, during the path, same as before.\n\nSo it should be ok.\n\nPerhaps for this problem, since the unsafe times are not at the beginning for the upper rows, I can proceed.\n\nBut in this case, with the sequence I have, it works with H=9 or H=10.\n\nBut to match the requirement, I think I need to output for H such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo with H=10, t1 + H -1 =35+10-1=44, y44=9.\n\nActions: turns 35 to 44.\n\na35 to a43: U, a44: S\n\nBut a44: S to stay at 9.\n\nSince y=9, U or D don't change, so I can put U or S, but S is fine.\n\nNow, in the output, I need to list the actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a problem with the cars.\n\nIn the sequence, with a35: U to y=1 at t=36\n\nt=36: y=1, safe, a36: U to y=2 at t=37\n\n...\nup to a43: U to y=9 at t=44? a43 at turn 43 sets y44.\n\nAt turn 43, I am at y43.\n\nIn the sequence with all U:\n\nAt turn 43: y43=8 (since from y35=0, after 8 actions U, y43=8)\n\nThen a43: U, y44=9\n\nThen at turn 44, y44=9, take a44: S, y45=9\n\nBut for collision, at turn 43, y43=8, which is freeway, and I need to check if safe.\n\nIn my earlier, at T=43, y=8, Δt=8, car span [-56+24, -45+24]=[-32,-21], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: S  (since at y=9)\n\nBut with 10 actions.\n\nSince the last action is at turn 44, and we are at 9, it can be S.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 44, action S.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=9? If H=9, then t1 + H -1 =35+9-1=43, we need y43=9.\n\nBut y43=9 requires that after actions from a35 to a42, y43=9.\n\nBut from y35=0, after 8 actions, y43 <=8, cannot be 9. So impossible to have y43=9. Thus H=9 is impossible for y_{t1+H-1}=9. Minimal H is 10.\n\nSo I need 10 actions.\n\nSimilarly, in the path, with first 9 actions U, but since H=10, I include an action at turn 44.\n\nNow, for the car at y=6 unsafe at T=42,43, but in this sequence, at T=42, I am on y=7, not y=6.\n\nAt T=42, y=7, safe.\n\nAt T=43, y=8, safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nPerhaps I can start later, but minimal H is 10.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: S\n\nBut at turn 44, action S.\n\nSince y=9, I can also do U, but y remains 9.\n\nBut S is fine.\n\nNow, in the output format.\n\nBut let me make sure about the unsafe times.\n\nAnother thing: at the beginning, y=7 is unsafe at T=36.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=36, I am on y=1, not y=7.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 and y=5 unsafe at T=36, but I am on y=1.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but cannot.\n\nOr slower, but minimal turns.\n\nH=10 is minimal for this requirement.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7, it has two cars, but I checked.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo the minimal H is 10.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: S\n\nNow for the boxed answer.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 35 + H - 1\\) with minimal \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\). The initial position at turn 35 is (0, 0).\n\n### Analysis of Car Movements and Unsafe Times\nThe cars on each freeway move at constant speeds, and their positions at any turn \\(T\\) (relative to \\(t_1 = 35\\)) are calculated with \\(\\Delta t = T - 35\\). A freeway \\(k\\) is unsafe at turn \\(T\\) if \\(0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway at \\(T\\). The unsafe times for each freeway are:\n\n- **y=1**: Unsafe only at \\(T=35\\) (but player starts at y=0, so safe for \\(T \\geq 36\\)).\n- **y=2**: Always safe.\n- **y=3**: Always safe.\n- **y=4**: Unsafe at \\(T=36\\).\n- **y=5**: Unsafe at \\(T=36\\).\n- **y=6**: Unsafe at \\(T=42, 43\\).\n- **y=7**: Unsafe at \\(T=35, 36\\) (but \\(T=35\\) is irrelevant as player starts at y=0; unsafe at \\(T=36\\)).\n- **y=8**: Unsafe at \\(T=50, 51, 52, 53\\).\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) Minimally\nTo reach y=9 from y=0, a net increase of +9 in y-position is required. Each \"U\" action increases y by 1 (if not at y=9), \"D\" decreases by 1 (if not at y=0), and \"S\" keeps y unchanged. The minimum number of actions to achieve a +9 net change is 9 \"U\" actions, arriving at y=9 at turn 44 (since y_{35} = 0, and after 9 \"U\" actions, y_{44} = 9).\n\nHowever, the task requires reaching (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 35 + H - 1\\). Setting \\(35 + H - 1 = 44\\) gives \\(H = 10\\). Thus, \\(H = 10\\) is minimal, with y_{44} = 9.\n\nThe sequence must include actions from turn 35 to turn 44 (10 actions). The first 9 actions are \"U\" to increase y from 0 to 9, arriving at y=9 at turn 44. At turn 44, the player is at y=9, so the action can be \"S\" (stay) to remain at y=9.\n\n### Collision Avoidance\nThe path is checked for collisions at each turn when on a freeway (y=1 to 8):\n- At turn 36: y=1 (safe, as y=1 unsafe only at T=35).\n- At turn 37: y=2 (always safe).\n- At turn 38: y=3 (always safe).\n- At turn 39: y=4 (safe, unsafe only at T=36).\n- At turn 40: y=5 (safe, unsafe only at T=36).\n- At turn 41: y=6 (safe, unsafe at T=42,43; T=41 is safe).\n- At turn 42: y=7 (safe, unsafe at T=35,36; T=42 is safe).\n- At turn 43: y=8 (safe, unsafe at T=50-53; T=43 is safe).\n\nNo collisions occur.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of 10 actions (\\(H = 10\\)) is:\n- Turns 35 to 43: \"U\" to move up, reaching y=9 at turn 44.\n- Turn 44: \"S\" to stay at y=9 (since already at target).\n\nThus, the actions are:\n- Turn 35: U\n- Turn 36: U\n- Turn 37: U\n- Turn 38: U\n- Turn 39: U\n- Turn 40: U\n- Turn 41: U\n- Turn 42: U\n- Turn 43: U\n- Turn 44: S\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 35: U \\\\\nTurn 36: U \\\\\nTurn 37: U \\\\\nTurn 38: U \\\\\nTurn 39: U \\\\\nTurn 40: U \\\\\nTurn 41: U \\\\\nTurn 42: U \\\\\nTurn 43: U \\\\\nTurn 44: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 36, and I have to output a sequence of actions starting from turn 36.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9. Since we're starting at y=1 and need to go to y=9, we probably want to move up most of the time, but we have to avoid the cars.\n\nCollision happens if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and there's a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span is the position of the car at time T.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1=36, and for future turns, we can calculate their positions based on their speed and direction.\n\nThe key point is that when you move to a new y-position, you are not on that freeway until the next turn. So, at turn T, if you move from y to y+1, at turn T you are still on y, and only at turn T+1 are you on y+1. Therefore, to avoid collision, at each turn T, for the freeway y_T that you're on, there should be no car where 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nAlso, since the cars move continuously, I need to compute for each freeway and each future turn whether a car is covering position 0 at that turn.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each freeway at t_1=36.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head 48, tail 1, direction right, speed 48? That seems fast. Head and tail, for right-moving, head is the front, I think. In the span definition, for right-moving, span is [τ, h] where τ is tail and h is head? Let me check the car update.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the initial state, for freeway 1: (48, 1, right, 48)\n\nSince it's right-moving, at time t_1, span is [τ, h] = [1, 48]? But it says head 48, tail 1, so tail τ=1, head h=48, so span at t_1 is [1,48] for right-moving.\n\nBut direction is right, so yes.\n\nSpeed is 48, which is very high. But let's keep it.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 4: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4? (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nFreeway 6: (-36, -47, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (56, 45, right, 4) and (8, -3, right, 4)\n\nFreeway 8: (-42, -53, right, 3)\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when position 0 is covered by a car at a given turn.\n\nSince collision depends on whether 0 is in the span at the exact turn, I need to compute for each possible (freeway, turn) whether it's safe to be there.\n\nBut turns are discrete, so I can compute the car positions over time.\n\nLet t be the turn number, with t_1=36 as the starting point.\n\nSo for turn T, relative time τ = T - t_1 = T - 36.\n\nThen for each car, at time T, the span is:\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s * τ, h + s * τ] where τ = T - 36\n\nSince τ = T - t_1, and s is speed.\n\nLet δt = T - 36.\n\nThen:\n\nRight-moving car: span at T: [τ + s * δt, h + s * δt]\n\nLeft-moving car: [h - s * δt, τ - s * δt]\n\nPosition 0 is covered if min(span) ≤ 0 ≤ max(span).\n\nSince for right-moving, τ is tail, h is head, so τ < h usually, so min is τ + s δt, max is h + s δt.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, if h is head, τ is tail, but for left, head is left, so h < τ, I think? In the update, for left-moving, span(T) = [h - s δt, τ - s δt], and it says \"head at h, tail at τ\", but in the initial state, for freeway 4: (-24, 11, left, 36), so head h=-24, tail τ=11? That seems odd because for left-moving, head should be less than tail.\n\nLet's see the update: for left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ] and span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\n\nIn the initial state, it says \"head h, tail τ\", so for freeway 4: head h=-24, tail τ=11, direction left.\n\nAt t_1, span is [h, τ] = [-24, 11]. Since it's left-moving, as time increases, the car moves left, so h decreases, τ decreases.\n\nPosition 0 is covered if min(span) ≤ 0 ≤ max(span). Since for left-moving, h < τ, min is h, max is τ at t_1, but after moving, min is h - s δt, max is τ - s δt.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, τ < h, min is τ, max is h at t_1, then min τ + s δt, max h + s δt.\n\nIn general, for any car, position 0 is covered at turn T if:\n\nFor right-moving: τ + s δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s δt\n\nFor left-moving: h - s δt ≤ 0 ≤ τ - s δt  (since h < τ for left-moving)\n\nNow let's list for each freeway the cars and when 0 is covered.\n\nStart with freeway 1:\n\nFreeway 1: one car, right-moving, τ=1, h=48, s=48, direction right.\n\nAt turn T, δt = T-36\n\nCovered if: τ + s δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s δt\n\nThat is, 1 + 48 δt ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 48 δt\n\nBut 1 + 48 δt ≤ 0 only if δt ≤ -1/48, but δt >=0 since T >=36, so 1 + 48 δt >=1 >0, so the left inequality is never true for δt >=0. Similarly, 0 <= 48 + 48 δt always true since δt >=0. But since min is 1 + 48 δt >=1 >0, so 0 is never covered? Let's see:\n\nmin = τ + s δt = 1 + 48 δt\n\nSince δt >=0, min >=1 >0, so 0 < min, so 0 not in [min, max]. So at no future time is position 0 covered on freeway 1? But at δt=0, min=1, max=48, 0 not in [1,48]. For δt>0, min even larger. So freeway 1 is always safe? But let's confirm.\n\nPosition 0 covered if min <=0 and 0<=max.\n\nHere min =1 +48δt >=1 >0, so min>0, so 0 not >= min, so not covered. Yes. So freeway 1 has no car covering 0 at any turn T>=36. So it's safe to be on freeway 1 at any time.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nτ = -59? Head h=-48, tail τ=-59? That seems backward.\n\nIn the state: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nIt says \"head h, tail τ\", and direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, at t_1, span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nThen at T, span [τ + s δt, h + s δt] = [-59 + 12 δt, -48 + 12 δt]\n\nPosition 0 covered if -59 + 12 δt <= 0 <= -48 + 12 δt\n\nThat is, -59 +12 δt <=0 and 0<= -48 +12 δt\n\nFirst inequality: -59 +12 δt <=0 => 12 δt <=59 => δt <= 59/12 = 4.916, so δt <=4 since integer? δt integer? Turns are integer, so δt integer >=0.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -48 +12 δt => 48 <=12 δt => δt >= 48/12 =4\n\nSo for δt=4, first inequality: -59 +12*4 = -59+48= -11 <=0 true, second: -48+48=0 <=0 true, so 0 covered at δt=4.\n\nFor δt<4, say δt=3: -59+36= -23 <=0 true, but 0 <= -48+36= -12? 0 <= -12 false, so not covered.\n\nFor δt=5: -59+60=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, and 0<= -48+60=12 true, but first false.\n\nSo only at δt=4, 0 is covered.\n\nNow second car on freeway 2: (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nτ=13? Head h=24, tail τ=13, direction right.\n\nAt t_1, span [13,24]\n\nAt T, [13 +12 δt, 24 +12 δt]\n\nCovered if 13+12δt <=0 <=24+12δt\n\n13+12δt <=0 only if δt <= -13/12, impossible since δt>=0, so min=13+12δt >=13>0, so 0 not covered. Always safe.\n\nSo for freeway 2, only unsafe when first car covers 0, which is at δt=4, so at T=36+4=40, turn 40, position 0 is covered on freeway 2.\n\nOther times, safe.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Cars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24,13,right,12)\n\nFirst car: same as above, covers 0 at δt=4, T=40.\n\nSecond car: same, never covers 0.\n\nSo freeway 3 unsafe only at turn 40.\n\nNow freeway 4: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, head h=-24, tail τ=11.\n\nFor left-moving, at t_1, span [h, τ] = [-24,11]? But left-moving, head should be left, so h=-24, τ=11, and since left-moving, h < τ.\n\nAt T, span [h - s δt, τ - s δt] = [-24 -36 δt, 11 -36 δt]\n\nPosition 0 covered if h - s δt <= 0 <= τ - s δt\n\nThat is, -24 -36 δt <= 0 and 0 <= 11 -36 δt\n\nFirst inequality: -24 -36 δt <=0 always true since left side negative.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 11 -36 δt => 36 δt <=11 => δt <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so only for δt=0? δt=0: 0<=11 true.\n\nFor δt=1: 0 <= 11-36= -25? false.\n\nSo only at δt=0, turn T=36, 0 is covered? But at T=36, we are considering the state, but for collision, if player is on freeway at turn T, and 0 covered.\n\nAt turn T=36, if player is on freeway 4, and 0 covered, so unsafe at T=36.\n\nBut player starts at y=1, not on freeway 4 yet.\n\nFor future turns, for δt>=1, 0 <= 11-36δt <=11-36=-25<0 false, so not covered.\n\nAt δt=0 only.\n\nBut since we start from T=36, and for T>36, δt>=1, not covered.\n\nSo freeway 4 unsafe only at turn 36? But turn 36 is now, and player is not on it.\n\nFor T>36, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as freeway 4? (-24,11,left,36) same car? Or different?\n\nIn the table, freeway 5 also has (-24,11,left,36), so identical to freeway 4.\n\nSo unsafe only at T=36, safe for T>36.\n\nNow freeway 6: (-36, -47, right, 6)\n\nRight-moving, head h=-36? Tail τ=-47.\n\nAt t_1, span [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt T, [ -47 +6 δt, -36 +6 δt ]\n\nCovered if -47 +6 δt <= 0 <= -36 +6 δt\n\nFirst: -47 +6δt <=0 => 6δt <=47 => δt <=47/6≈7.833, so δt<=7\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 +6δt => 36 <=6δt => δt >=6\n\nSo for δt=6,7\n\nδt=6: -47+36= -11<=0 true, 0<= -36+36=0 true.\n\nδt=7: -47+42= -5<=0 true, 0<= -36+42=6 true.\n\nδt=5: -47+30= -17<=0 true, but 0<= -36+30= -6? false.\n\nδt=8: -47+48=1<=0 false, 0<= -36+48=12 true, but first false.\n\nSo unsafe at δt=6 and 7, T=42 and 43.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (56,45,right,4)\n\nHead h=56, tail τ=45? Direction right.\n\nAt t_1, span [45,56]\n\nAt T, [45 +4 δt, 56 +4 δt]\n\nMin=45+4δt >=45>0, so 0 not covered. Safe.\n\nSecond car: (8,-3,right,4)\n\nHead h=8, tail τ=-3? Direction right.\n\nAt t_1, span [τ, h] = [-3,8]\n\nAt T, [ -3 +4 δt, 8 +4 δt ]\n\nCovered if -3 +4δt <=0 <= 8 +4δt\n\nFirst: -3+4δt <=0 => 4δt <=3 => δt <= 0.75, so δt=0 only? Since δt integer.\n\nδt=0: -3<=0 true, 0<=8 true.\n\nδt=1: -3+4=1<=0? false, 0<=8+4=12 true, but first false.\n\nSo only at δt=0, T=36, unsafe.\n\nBut for T>36, safe.\n\nNow freeway 8: (-42,-53,right,3)\n\nHead h=-42, tail τ=-53? Direction right.\n\nAt t_1, span [τ, h] = [-53,-42]\n\nAt T, [ -53 +3 δt, -42 +3 δt ]\n\nCovered if -53 +3δt <=0 <= -42 +3δt\n\nFirst: -53+3δt <=0 => 3δt <=53 => δt <=53/3≈17.666, δt<=17\n\nSecond: 0 <= -42 +3δt => 42 <=3δt => δt >=14\n\nSo for δt=14 to 17 inclusive.\n\nδt=14: -53+42= -11<=0 true, 0<= -42+42=0 true\n\nδt=15: -53+45= -8<=0 true, 0<= -42+45=3 true\n\nδt=16: -53+48= -5<=0 true, 0<= -42+48=6 true\n\nδt=17: -53+51= -2<=0 true, 0<= -42+51=9 true\n\nδt=13: -53+39= -14<=0 true, 0<= -42+39= -3? false\n\nδt=18: -53+54=1<=0 false, etc.\n\nSo unsafe at T=36+14=50 to 53? δt=14,15,16,17 so T=50,51,52,53.\n\nT=36+14=50, up to 36+17=53.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway when it is unsafe (0 covered):\n\nFreeway 1: always safe\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=40\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe at T=40\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe only at T=36\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe only at T=36\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe at T=42,43\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe only at T=36\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=50,51,52,53\n\nAlso, freeway 0 and 9 are not freeways, I think? y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, only y=1 to 8 have cars, and collision only on freeways, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume.\n\nThe problem says \"freeways y=1,...,8\", and player starts at (0,1), which is on freeway y=1? Position (0,y), so at (0,1), y=1, which is a freeway.\n\nBut y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, always safe.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is y=9, safe.\n\nNow, player starts at turn 36, y=1.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1, but y between 0 and 9.\n\nTo minimize turns, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nSince moving up takes time, and we have to stay within bounds.\n\ny from 1 to 9, minimum steps: if we go up every turn, from y=1 to y=9, that's 8 steps: after 8 ups, y=9.\n\nBut we might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nBut going down might increase time.\n\nSo minimal H is at least 8.\n\nNow, let's see the unsafe times.\n\nSince we start at turn 36, and need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn when we arrive at each y.\n\nBut we move step by step.\n\nWe need a sequence of actions from turn 36 onwards.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T, and we need to ensure that for each T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, then at that turn, freeway y_T is safe, i.e., not unsafe at T.\n\nFor y_T =0 or 9, no problem.\n\nStart at T=36, y=1.\n\nFreeway 1: at T=36, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 1: we said always safe, so yes.\n\nBut freeway 1 has no car covering 0, so safe at all times.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nBut at T=36, for y=1, freeway 1 is safe.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nTo minimize time, we should go up when possible.\n\nBut let's see future unsafe spots.\n\nFirst, freeway 2 and 3 are unsafe only at T=40.\n\nFreeway 4 and 5 unsafe only at T=36, which is now, but we are not on them.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe at T=42,43.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe only at T=36.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at T=50-53.\n\nSince we start at y=1, and go up, we might hit y=2 at some point.\n\ny=2 is freeway 2.\n\nUnsafe at T=40.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 unsafe at T=40.\n\nNow, if we go directly up, starting from T=36, y=1.\n\nAt T=36: we can choose action.\n\nIf we go up, at T=37, y=2.\n\nOr stay, or down, but down to y=0 might not help.\n\ny=0 is safe, but we need to go up eventually.\n\nSince we need to go to y=9, and y=1 is safe now, we should start going up.\n\nAssume we go up every turn, if possible.\n\nStart: T=36, y=1, action U, then T=37, y=2\n\nT=37, y=2, action U, T=38, y=3\n\nT=38, y=3, action U, T=39, y=4\n\nT=39, y=4, action U, T=40, y=5\n\nNow at T=40, y=5.\n\nFreeway 5: y=5.\n\nFreeway 5 is unsafe only at T=36, which is past, so at T=40, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 and 3 are unsafe at T=40, but we are on y=5, not on y=2 or 3.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nContinue: T=40, y=5, action U, T=41, y=6\n\nT=41, y=6, action U, T=42, y=7\n\nNow at T=42, y=7.\n\nFreeway 7: at T=42, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe only at T=36, so at T=42, safe.\n\nBut we are on y=7, freeway 7.\n\nSafe.\n\nNow action U, T=43, y=8\n\nAt T=43, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at T=50-53, but T=43 is before, so safe.\n\nThen action U, T=44, y=9, reached.\n\nSo in this path: from T=36 to T=44, that's 9 turns? Let's count.\n\nStart at T=36, y=1.\n\nAfter action at T=36, y becomes 2 at T=37.\n\nGenerally, after action at T, y_{T+1} = y_T + delta y.\n\nAt turn T, we take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nWe start at turn T=36 with y=1.\n\nWe need to specify actions from t=36 onwards.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=36 + H, we have y_{36+H} =9.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nAt T=36: action U, so y_{37} = y_{36} +1 =1+1=2\n\nT=37: action U, y_{38}=3\n\nT=38: action U, y_{39}=4\n\nT=39: action U, y_{40}=5\n\nT=40: action U, y_{41}=6\n\nT=41: action U, y_{42}=7\n\nT=42: action U, y_{43}=8\n\nT=43: action U, y_{44}=9\n\nSo at turn 44, y=9, so we reached at turn 44.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=36 to T=43, that's 8 actions, H=8.\n\nT=36 to T=43 inclusive? Actions at T=36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43: 8 turns, and at turn 44, position is (0,9).\n\nThe sequence ends when we reach (0,9), so after action at T=43, at T=44 we are at y=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, we specify up to when we reach.\n\nIn this case, with 8 actions, we go directly up, and in this path, we never were on an unsafe freeway at unsafe time.\n\nLet me verify:\n\nAt each turn, when we are on a freeway, it was safe.\n\nStart: T=36, y=1, freeway 1, safe (always)\n\nAfter U at T=36, at T=37, y=2, freeway 2.\n\nAt T=37, is freeway 2 safe? Earlier we said freeway 2 unsafe only at T=40.\n\nT=37, δt=37-36=1, for freeway 2, first car: at δt=1, min=-59+12*1=-47, max=-48+12= -36? Earlier: [ -59 +12δt, -48 +12δt]\n\nAt δt=1: [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36], 0 not in, since both negative.\n\nSecond car: [13+12,24+12]=[25,36], min>0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nT=38, y=3, freeway 3.\n\nSimilarly, at T=38, δt=2, freeway 3 same as freeway 2, cars: first car [-59+24, -48+24]=[-35,-24], 0 not in; second car [13+24,24+24]=[37,48], safe.\n\nT=39, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nAt T=39, δt=3, freeway 4: left-moving car, [h - s δt, τ - s δt] = [-24 -36*3, 11 -36*3] = [-24-108, 11-108] = [-132, -97], min and max negative, 0 not covered. Safe.\n\nT=40, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nSimilarly, at T=40, δt=4, freeway 5: same car, [-24-144, 11-144]=[-168,-133], safe.\n\nT=41, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nAt T=41, δt=5, freeway 6: car [ -47 +6*5, -36 +6*5] = [-47+30, -36+30] = [-17,-6], both negative, 0 not in. Unsafe only at δt=6,7, so safe.\n\nT=42, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nAt T=42, δt=6, freeway 7: first car always safe, second car: at δt=6, [ -3 +4*6, 8 +4*6] = [-3+24, 8+24] = [21,32], min>0, safe. (unsafe only at δt=0)\n\nT=43, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nAt T=43, δt=7, freeway 8: car [ -53 +3*7, -42 +3*7] = [-53+21, -42+21] = [-32,-21], both negative, 0 not covered. Unsafe only from δt=14 to17, so safe.\n\nThen at T=43 action U, to y=9 at T=44.\n\nSo all safe, and reached in 8 turns.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer turns? From y=1 to y=9, minimum 8 steps up, so H=8 is minimal.\n\nWe could go faster? But each up increases y by one, so from 1 to 9, 8 ups, minimum 8 actions.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we start at y=1.\n\ny=1 to y=9, delta y=8, each U increases by 1, so at least 8 U actions, and no other actions needed if no waiting, so minimal H=8.\n\nAnd in this case, it works with all U.\n\nBut earlier I thought about freeway 2 and 3 unsafe at T=40, but in the path, at T=40, we are at y=5, not on y=2 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 8 unsafe times: T=50 to 53, which is later, not relevant here.\n\nIn this sequence, we reach at T=44, which is before 50.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,1) at turn 36, and after 8 actions, at turn 44, position (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, actions at turn 36 to 43, all U.\n\nBut let me write the actions.\n\nTurn t_1: action a_{t_1} = U\n\nThen turn t_1 +1: U, etc.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nt_1=36.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nAfter action at turn 43, at turn 44, y=9.\n\nAnd H=8.\n\nBut is there any problem?\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe at T=42 and 43.\n\nIn our path, at T=42, we are at y=7, not on y=6.\n\nAt T=43, y=8, not on y=6.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps we can go slower to avoid something, but no need, since direct path works.\n\nBut let me see if at some point we need to wait.\n\nFor example, suppose we stayed at y=1 for some time.\n\nBut y=1 is always safe, but if we stay, it takes more turns, so worse.\n\nSimilarly, going down to y=0 and up, but y=0 to y=1 is extra, so more turns.\n\nSo minimal is 8 with all U.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 7, there was a car at (8,-3,right,4), which at T=36 covers 0, but we are not on freeway 7 at T=36.\n\nIn our path, we reach y=7 at T=42, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's list the position at each turn:\n\nTurn T | y_T | freeway | safe?\n\nT=36: y=1, freeway 1, safe\n\nAfter action U at T=36: y_{37} =2\n\nT=37: y=2, freeway 2, at T=37, safe as above\n\nAction U: y_{38}=3\n\nT=38: y=3, freeway 3, safe\n\nU: y_{39}=4\n\nT=39: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\nU: y_{40}=5\n\nT=40: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\nU: y_{41}=6\n\nT=41: y=6, freeway 6, at T=41, δt=5, freeway 6: car position [-47+30, -36+30]=[-17,-6], 0 not in, safe\n\nU: y_{42}=7\n\nT=42: y=7, freeway 7, at T=42, δt=6, freeway 7: first car [45+24,56+24]=[69,80]? Earlier: at T, [45 +4δt,56+4δt], δt=6, [45+24,56+24]=[69,80], min>0; second car [-3+24,8+24]=[21,32], min>0, safe\n\nU: y_{43}=8\n\nT=43: y=8, freeway 8, at T=43, δt=7, car [-53+21, -42+21]=[-32,-21], 0 not in, safe\n\nU: y_{44}=9, reached.\n\nAll safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 8, with all up actions.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me see if we can do in less than 8? Impossible, as 8 steps needed.\n\nPerhaps if we go down first, but that would increase steps.\n\nFor example, at T=36, go down to y=0, then we need to go up to y=9, which takes 9 actions: down to 0, then 9 ups, but y=0 to y=9 is 9 ups, but we start from y=1 down to 0, then up, so at least 10 actions, worse.\n\nSimilarly, staying or down only wastes time.\n\nSo H=8 is minimal.\n\nThus, the sequence is all U for 8 turns.\n\nBut in the output, it should be from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nt_1=36, H=8, so actions from turn 36 to 36+7=43? Let's see.\n\nActions at t=36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43. That's 8 actions.\n\nt from 36 to 43 inclusive, which is 43-36+1=8 turns.\n\nThen at turn 44, we are at y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in the answer:\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the answer format, it just shows the sequence, I think H is implied.\n\nNow, but in the car states, for freeway 2 and 3, unsafe at T=40, but we are not on them at that time.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 unsafe at 42,43, not on it.\n\nBut what if we were on y=2 at T=40? Then it would be unsafe, but in our path, at T=40, we are at y=5.\n\nSimilarly, at T=42, we are at y=7, not y=6.\n\nSo fine.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster? But no.\n\nAnother thing: the player can stay or move down to avoid being on a freeway at a bad time, but in this case, not necessary.\n\nFor example, suppose we want to be on y=6 at T=42, but it's unsafe, so we should not be on y=6 at T=42 or 43.\n\nBut in our path, we are on y=6 at T=41, which is safe, and move up at T=41 to y=7 at T=42.\n\nAt T=42, y=7, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIf we were slower, say at T=42 we were still on y=6, then unsafe.\n\nBut we are not.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is straightforward.\n\nBut in the initial car state, for freeway 1, there is a car, but it doesn't cover 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nI think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 36\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 8, achieved by moving up (U) at every turn from turn 36 to turn 43. This sequence ensures the player reaches y=9 at turn 44 without any collisions, as verified by checking the safety of each freeway at the relevant turns:\n\n- At turn 36: y=1 (freeway 1) is safe, as freeway 1 is always safe.\n- At turn 37: y=2 (freeway 2) is safe, as freeway 2 is unsafe only at turn 40.\n- At turn 38: y=3 (freeway 3) is safe, as freeway 3 is unsafe only at turn 40.\n- At turn 39: y=4 (freeway 4) is safe, as freeway 4 is unsafe only at turn 36.\n- At turn 40: y=5 (freeway 5) is safe, as freeway 5 is unsafe only at turn 36.\n- At turn 41: y=6 (freeway 6) is safe, as freeway 6 is unsafe only at turns 42 and 43.\n- At turn 42: y=7 (freeway 7) is safe, as freeway 7 is unsafe only at turn 36.\n- At turn 43: y=8 (freeway 8) is safe, as freeway 8 is unsafe only at turns 50 to 53.\n\nAfter the action at turn 43, the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 44. Since y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, they are always safe, and no collisions occur during the sequence.\n\nThis path achieves the minimum \\(H = 8\\) because moving from y=1 to y=9 requires at least 8 up actions, and no shorter sequence is possible.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 36: U \\\\\nTurn 37: U \\\\\nTurn 38: U \\\\\nTurn 39: U \\\\\nTurn 40: U \\\\\nTurn 41: U \\\\\nTurn 42: U \\\\\nTurn 43: U\n}",

Each turn, the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Importantly, when moving to a new y, you're not on that y until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and at T+1 you're on y+1.\n\nThe car spans move over time based on their direction and speed. For left-moving cars, the span shifts left, so h and tau decrease by s per turn. For right-moving, h and tau increase by s per turn.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from turn 37 onwards to get to y=9 as quickly as possible without colliding.\n\nFirst, list all the cars and their initial states at turn 37 for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (96, 49, right, 48)\n\nSince it's right-moving, head is h=96, tail tau=49? The notation says \"head h, tail tau\", and for right-moving, span is [tau, h], so in this case, [49, 96] I think? But it says (head h, tail tau), so for right-moving, h is the front, tau is the back? Let me read carefully.\n\nThe car update: for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, tau] -> span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving, span(t1) = [tau, h] -> span(T) = [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSo for right-moving, at t1, span is [tau, h], meaning tau is the left end, h is the right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, tau] with h left, tau right? Let's see: for left-moving, [h - sΔT, tau - sΔT], so as time increases, both decrease, so h is the left end? No.\n\nIn left-moving, car moves left, so position decreases. Span at T: [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)], so if s>0, h - sΔT < h, so the left end decreases, meaning h is the initial left position? I'm getting confused.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of the position at time.\n\nFor a left-moving car, at time t1, the head (front) is at h, and tail (back) is at tau, with h < tau? But if it's moving left, front should be left? I think I need to clarify the coordinate.\n\nAssume x-axis, with 0 being the player's x-position. Cars are on lanes y=1 to 8, and their x-positions matter for collision.\n\nCollision when player is at (0, y) at turn T, and for that y, 0 is in the car's span at T.\n\nSpan is the interval of x-coordinates occupied by the car.\n\nFor left-moving car: direction left, so at t1, span [h, tau] with h the head (front) and tau the tail, so since moving left, head is smaller x? In the update: span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince s>0, as T increases, both ends decrease, so the car moves left. So h is the x-position of the head at t1, and since moving left, head is at the left, so h < tau, I think. For example, if h=5, tau=10, moving left, at later time, both smaller.\n\nIn the problem: for left-moving, \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and h - sΔT, so if h < tau, then [h, tau] is from left to right? But moving left, so head should be left, so yes, h is left end, tau is right end.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and tau + sΔT, h + sΔT, so tau is left end, h is right end, and both increase, moving right.\n\nSo let's define:\n\nFor any car, at time t, the span is [left(t), right(t)].\n\nFor left-moving car: at t1, left(t1) = h, right(t1) = tau\n\nThen at T, left(T) = h - s(T-t1), right(T) = tau - s(T-t1)\n\nFor right-moving car: at t1, left(t1) = tau, right(t1) = h\n\nThen at T, left(T) = tau + s(T-t1), right(T) = h + s(T-t1)\n\nCollision at T if player on freeway y at T, and 0 is in [left(T), right(T)] for some car on that freeway.\n\nPlayer is at y-position at each turn, and x=0 always.\n\nNow, at turn 37, player at (0,2).\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nList for each freeway the cars at t1=37.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head h=96, tail tau=49, direction right, speed s=48)\n\nDirection is right, so since right-moving, at t1, left = tau = 49, right = h = 96\n\nSpan [49,96] at t=37.\n\nSpeed 48, so at time T, left(T) = 49 + 48*(T-37), right(T) = 96 + 48*(T-37)\n\nCollision if at some T, y_T=1 and 0 in [left(T), right(T)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars: (-36, -47, right, 12) and (36, 25, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: (h=-36, tau=-47, d=right, s=12) — since right-moving, left(t1) = tau = -47, right(t1) = h = -36\n\nSpan at t37: [-47, -36]\n\nSecond car: (h=36, tau=25, d=right, s=12) — left(t1) = tau=25, right(t1)=h=36, span [25,36]\n\nBoth right-moving, speed 12.\n\nAt time T, for first car: left(T) = -47 + 12*(T-37), right(T) = -36 + 12*(T-37)\n\nSecond car: left(T) = 25 + 12*(T-37), right(T) = 36 + 12*(T-37)\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"(-36, -47, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12)\" — identical to freeway 2? Probably a copy-paste, but we'll treat as separate.\n\nFreeway 4: (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so at t1, left(t1) = h = -60, right(t1) = tau = -25? For left-moving, span(t1) = [h, tau] with h left, tau right.\n\nSo h=-60, tau=-25, so left(t1) = -60, right(t1) = -25\n\nThen at T, left(T) = -60 - 36*(T-37), right(T) = -25 - 36*(T-37)\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4? \"(-60, -25, left, 36)\" — identical.\n\nFreeway 6: (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nDirection right, so at t1, left(t1) = tau = -41, right(t1) = h = -30? h is head, for right-moving, head is right end.\n\nCar: (head h=-30, tail tau=-41, d=right, s=6)\n\nSince right-moving, left(t1) = tau = -41, right(t1) = h = -30\n\nSpan [-41, -30] at t37.\n\nAt T, left(T) = -41 + 6*(T-37), right(T) = -30 + 6*(T-37)\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (60, 49, right, 4) and (12, 1, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: (h=60, tau=49, d=right, s=4) — right-moving, left(t1) = tau=49, right(t1)=h=60, span [49,60]\n\nSecond car: (h=12, tau=1, d=right, s=4) — left(t1)=tau=1, right(t1)=h=12, span [1,12]\n\nBoth speed 4.\n\nAt T, for first: left(T) = 49 + 4*(T-37), right(T) = 60 + 4*(T-37)\n\nSecond: left(T) = 1 + 4*(T-37), right(T) = 12 + 4*(T-37)\n\nFreeway 8: (-39, -50, right, 3)\n\nCar: (h=-39, tau=-50, d=right, s=3) — right-moving, left(t1) = tau = -50, right(t1) = h = -39, span [-50,-39]\n\nAt T, left(T) = -50 + 3*(T-37), right(T) = -39 + 3*(T-37)\n\nNow, player starts at y=2 at t=37.\n\nWe need to go to y=9. Since y=0 to 9, and we start at 2, to reach 9, we need to move up 7 times, but we can stay or move down, so minimal H might be more than 7 if we have to wait to avoid cars.\n\nH is the number of turns including the starting point? The sequence is from t=37 to t=37+H-1, and y at turn 37+H-1 should be 9.\n\nTurn t: position y_t.\n\nAt turn 37, y=2.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn 37+H-1, y=9.\n\nThe number of actions is H, from t=37 to t=37+H-1? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe actions are for turns t=37, t=38, ..., up to some turn.\n\nThe player position after action: at turn t, after action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nBut the position at turn t is given before action? Let's read.\n\n\"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t\"\n\nAnd collision at turn T if on freeway y_T, with cars on that freeway at T.\n\nSo at each turn t, we have y_t, and we choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t, we are at y_t, and we check for collision with cars on y_t at time t.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{t+1} ≠ y_t at turn t, you are not on y_{t+1} at turn t, so no collision from cars on y_{t+1} at t.\n\nOnly cars on y_t at time t matter.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need y_t =9 for some t.\n\nSince we start at y=2, and can move up, down, or stay, the minimal number of turns to increase y by 7 is 7, if we always move up.\n\nBut we may need to stay or move down to avoid cars, so H >=7.\n\nNow, we need to find a path from y=2 to y=9 in y-steps, but with time, since cars move.\n\nThe y-position changes slowly, but cars move in x over time.\n\nTo avoid collision, at each turn when we are on a freeway y (1 to 8), we must ensure that no car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that time.\n\nFor freeway y, at time t, if we are on it, check the cars on that y.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we can find when it is safe to be on it, i.e., when 0 is not in any car's span for that freeway at that time.\n\nSince the spans change linearly with time, we can find time intervals when the freeway is safe.\n\nBut for each freeway, multiple cars, so we need the union of unsafe times.\n\nThen for the player, when moving to a freeway, we need to be there at a safe time.\n\nBut since we control the y-movement, we can choose when to enter each freeway.\n\nThe player can only change y by at most 1 per turn, so to go from y=2 to y=9, we must pass through each y from 2 to 9, but we can stay or go back, so we might not visit all, but since we start at 2 and go to 9, we will visit y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 at some points, but not necessarily consecutively if we move down, but to increase y, we need to go through each integer, but with possible backtracking.\n\nFor example, from y=2, we can go to y=3 or y=1 or stay, but since we need to reach 9, and y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, as no cars, but y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nCollision only on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nAt y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2, which is a freeway, so we need to check for cars at t=37 on y=2.\n\nSimilarly, when at y=9, it's safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal H: if no cars, we can go up 7 times in 7 turns: from t=37 to t=43, y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 at turns 37 to 43? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 37: y=2\n\nAfter a_{37}: if U, y_{38} = 3\n\nAt turn 38: y=3\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{43}: if U, y_{44} =9\n\nAt turn 44: y=9\n\nSo turns: from t=37 to t=44, that's 8 turns? Positions:\n\nTurn t: y_t\n\nt=37: y=2\n\nt=38: y=3 (if a37=U)\n\nt=39: y=4\n\n...\n\nt=44: y=9\n\nSo from t=37 to t=44, that's 8 turns, with y from 2 to 9, 7 steps.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=37 to t=43, 7 actions, to reach y=9 at t=44.\n\nThe sequence {a_t} for t=37 to t=37+H-1, and y_{t_1 + H} =9? No.\n\nDefine: at turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nWe start at turn t1=37, y_{37} =2.\n\nWe want y_{t} =9 for some t.\n\nMinimal t such that y_t=9.\n\nSince we start at t=37, y=2, the minimal t to reach 9 is t=37+7=44 if we always move up, so H=8 turns from 37 to 44, but the number of actions is 7, from t=37 to t=43.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t1 + t.\n\nFor example, t=0: a_{t1}, t=1: a_{t1+1}, ..., up to t=H-1: a_{t1 + H-1}\n\nThen after these actions, at turn t1 + H, y_{t1 + H} = y_t + sum of Δy from t to t+H-1.\n\nStart at turn t1, y_{t1} = initial.\n\nAfter a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\nAfter a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter a_{t1 + H-1}, y_{t1 + H} = y_{t1 + H-1} + Δy_{t1 + H-1}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nAt turn t1 + H, we are at y=9.\n\nThe position at the end of the sequence.\n\nIn this case, t1=37, y_{37}=2.\n\nWe want y_{37 + H} =9.\n\nSo we need to increase y by 7, so minimal H if we always move up: H=7, with a_t = U for t=37 to 42, then y_{43} = 2 + 6*1 = 8? Let's calculate:\n\nAfter a_{37}: y_{38} = 2 +1 =3 if U\n\nAfter a_{38}: y_{39} =3+1=4\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{42}: y_{43} =7+1=8? Start: y_{37}=2\n\nAfter a_{37}: y_{38} =3\n\nAfter a_{38}: y_{39} =4\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{43}: y_{44} =9\n\nSo to reach y_{44} =9, we need actions from t=37 to t=43, that's 7 actions.\n\nH-1 actions? Sequence {a_t} for t=0 to H-1 of the index, so for index t from 0 to H-1, action at t1 + t.\n\nSo number of actions is H.\n\nAfter H actions, we reach turn t1 + H with y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nFrom y_{37} =2 to y_{37+H} =9, so the change in y is +7, so we need at least 7 U actions, and possibly some S or D, but D would make it worse, so minimal H is 7, with all U.\n\nBut we may need more if we have to wait or detour due to cars.\n\nIn this case, with cars, we may not be able to go directly up.\n\nFirst, let's check for each freeway when it is unsafe, i.e., when there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nFor each freeway, find the times T when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nT is the turn number.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, we can find for each car the time when 0 is in its span.\n\nThen for a freeway, it is unsafe if any car on it has 0 in span at that T.\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nAlso, at T, if no car has 0 in span, it is safe to be on that freeway at that time.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: y=1\n\nCar: right-moving, s=48, at t37, left=49, right=96\n\nSpan [49,96] at t37.\n\nAt time T, left(T) = 49 + 48*(T-37), right(T) = 96 + 48*(T-37)\n\n0 in span if left(T) <= 0 <= right(T)\n\nSo 49 + 48*(T-37) <= 0 <= 96 + 48*(T-37)\n\nFirst inequality: 49 + 48*(T-37) <= 0 => 48*(T-37) <= -49 => T-37 <= -49/48 = -1.0208... so T-37 <= -2 since T integer? T-37 is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nT-37 is integer, let k = T-37, k integer.\n\nSo left(T) = 49 + 48k\n\nright(T) = 96 + 48k\n\n0 in [49+48k, 96+48k] if 49+48k <= 0 and 0 <= 96+48k\n\nBut 49+48k <=0 for k <= -2 since 48*(-2) = -96, 49-96= -47 <=0, for k=-1, 49-48=1>0, not <=0.\n\n49+48k <=0 when k <= -2? k=-2: 49 +48*(-2) =49-96= -47 <=0, true\n\nk=-1: 49-48=1 >0, false\n\nk=0:49>0, false\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 96+48k always true for k >=0, but for k negative, 96+48k, k=-2:96-96=0, so 0<=0 true, k=-3:96-144=-48<0, 0<= -48 false? 0 <= right(T)\n\nright(T) =96+48k\n\n0 <= 96+48k when 96+48k >=0, k >= -96/48 = -2 exactly.\n\nk >= -2.\n\nSo 0 <= right(T) for k >= -2\n\nAnd left(T) <=0 for 49+48k <=0, k <= -49/48 = -1.0208, so since k integer, k <= -2? k=-2: -47<=0 true, k=-1:1<=0 false, so only k<= -2 for left<=0.\n\nBut we need both left(T) <=0 and 0<= right(T)\n\nFor k= -2: left(T) =49 +48*(-2)=49-96=-47 <=0, right(T)=96-96=0, so 0 in [-47,0], yes.\n\nFor k= -1: left(T)=49-48=1, right=96-48=48, 0 not in [1,48]\n\nk=0: [49,96], 0 not in\n\nk=1: [49+48,96+48]=[97,144], etc.\n\nSo only at k= -2, T-37= -2, T=35\n\nBut T=35 is before t37, so for T>=37, no collision on freeway 1, since only unsafe at T=35.\n\nAt T=35, but we start at t=37, so for t>=37, freeway 1 is always safe? At T=35, k=-2, but T=35<37, so for T=37 and later, k>=0, left(T) >=49>0, so 0 not in span, safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other k, not.\n\nSo freeway 1 is safe for all T >=37.\n\nGood.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2, but player starts at y=2 at t=37, so we need to check at t=37.\n\nFreeway 2 has two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,12) — right-moving, so at t37, left= tau = -47, right= h = -36\n\nSpan [-47,-36]\n\nAt T, left(T) = -47 + 12*(T-37)\n\nright(T) = -36 + 12*(T-37)\n\n0 in span if left(T) <=0 <= right(T)\n\nSo -47 +12k <=0 and 0 <= -36 +12k, where k=T-37\n\nFirst: -47 +12k <=0 => 12k <=47 => k <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so k<=3 since integer\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 +12k => 36 <=12k => k >=3\n\nSo k>=3 and k<=3, so k=3\n\nAt k=3, T=37+3=40\n\nleft(T)= -47 +12*3 = -47+36= -11 <=0\n\nright(T)= -36 +36=0, so 0 in [-11,0], yes.\n\nFor other k, not both true.\n\nSecond car on y=2: (36,25,right,12) — head h=36, tail tau=25, right-moving, so left(t1)=tau=25, right(t1)=h=36, span [25,36] at t37.\n\nAt T, left(T)=25 +12k, right(T)=36+12k\n\n0 in [25+12k, 36+12k]? 25+12k <=0 and 0<=36+12k\n\n25+12k <=0 => k <= -25/12 ≈ -2.083, k<=-3? k=-3:25-36=-11<=0, k=-2:25-24=1>0\n\n0<=36+12k always for k>=-3, since min at k=-3, 36-36=0.\n\nBut 25+12k <=0 only for k<=-3, and 0<=36+12k for k>=-3.\n\nSo for k=-3: left=25-36=-11<=0, right=36-36=0, 0 in [-11,0]\n\nBut k=T-37=-3, T=34\n\nFor k>=-2, left>=1>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo only unsafe at T=34 for this car, which is before 37.\n\nThus for freeway 2, first car unsafe at T=40, second car unsafe only at T=34, so overall, unsafe only at T=40.\n\nAt T=40, for first car, 0 is in span.\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nNow, player at t=37 on y=2.\n\nAt t=37, is it safe? For freeway 2, at t=37, k=0.\n\nFirst car: left(37)= -47, right= -36, both negative, 0 not in [-47,-36]\n\nSecond car: [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe at t=37.\n\nUnsafe only at t=40.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"(-36, -47, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12)\" identical, so same as y=2, unsafe only at T=40.\n\nFreeway 4: (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nLeft-moving, so at t37, left(t1)=h= -60, right(t1)=tau= -25? For left-moving, span(t1)= [h,tau] with h left, tau right, so [ -60, -25]\n\nAt T, left(T)= -60 -36*(T-37)\n\nright(T)= -25 -36*(T-37)\n\n0 in span if left(T) <=0 <= right(T)\n\nSo -60 -36k <=0 and 0 <= -25 -36k, where k=T-37\n\nFirst: -60 -36k <=0 => -36k <=60 => multiply both sides by -1, reverse inequality, 36k >= -60 => k >= -60/36 = -5/3 ≈ -1.666, so k >= -1\n\nSecond: 0 <= -25 -36k => 0 <= - (25 +36k) => 0 >= 25 +36k?

From above, y=3 unsafe only at t=40, so at t=38, safe.\n\nSimilarly, move up to y=4 at t=39.\n\ny=4 safe at all t>=37, since unsafe only at t=36.\n\nt=39 safe.\n\nThen to y=5 at t=40.\n\ny=5 safe, similar to y=4.\n\nBut at t=40, we are at y=5? Let's see the turn.\n\nAt turn t, y_t.\n\nt=37: y=2\n\nAfter a_{37}=U, y_{38}=3\n\nt=38: y=3\n\nAfter a_{38}=U, y_{39}=4\n\nt=39: y=4\n\nAfter a_{39}=U, y_{40}=5\n\nt=40: y=5\n\nNow, at t=40, y=5, which is safe, since y=5 unsafe only at t=36.\n\nBut y=2 and y=3 are unsafe at t=40, but we are at y=5 at t=40, so not on y=2 or y=3, so no problem.\n\nContinue: after a_{39}=U, y_{40}=5\n\nt=40: y=5, safe\n\nNow move up to y=6: after a_{40}=U, y_{41}=6\n\nt=41: y=6\n\nIs y=6 safe at t=41? From above, y=6 unsafe at t=42 and 43.\n\nt=41 not unsafe, so safe.\n\nThen to y=7: after a_{41}=U, y_{42}=7\n\nt=42: y=7\n\ny=7 always safe, so safe.\n\nBut at t=42, we are at y=7.\n\ny=6 is unsafe at t=42, but we are not on y=6 at t=42, we are on y=7.\n\nt=42: y=7, safe.\n\nThen move up to y=8: after a_{42}=U, y_{43}=8\n\nt=43: y=8\n\nNow, is y=8 safe at t=43? y=8 unsafe at t=50-53, not 43, so safe? t=43, k=T-37=6, y=8 unsafe only at t=50-53, which is later, so at t=43, safe.\n\nThen to y=9: after a_{43}=U, y_{44}=9\n\nt=44: y=9, safe, since no cars.\n\nBut at t=43, we are at y=8.\n\ny=6 is unsafe at t=43, but we are on y=8.\n\nSo seems we can go directly up without problem.\n\nBut let's confirm the positions and times.\n\nt=37: y=2, safe (as earlier)\n\na_{37}=U: y_{38}=3\n\nt=38: y=3, safe? y=3 unsafe at t=40, but t=38 not 40, safe.\n\na_{38}=U: y_{39}=4\n\nt=39: y=4, safe\n\na_{39}=U: y_{40}=5\n\nt=40: y=5, safe\n\na_{40}=U: y_{41}=6\n\nt=41: y=6, now y=6 unsafe at t=42,43, but t=41 not, so safe.\n\na_{41}=U: y_{42}=7\n\nt=42: y=7, safe (y=7 always safe)\n\na_{42}=U: y_{43}=8\n\nt=43: y=8, safe? y=8 unsafe at t=50-53, not 43, so safe.\n\na_{43}=U: y_{44}=9\n\nt=44: y=9, done.\n\nSo with 7 actions: a_{37} to a_{43} all U, reach y=9 at t=44.\n\nBut is there any collision? At t=40, we are at y=5, not on y=2 or y=3, so no issue with y=2 and y=3 being unsafe at t=40.\n\nSimilarly, at t=42, we are at y=7, not on y=6.\n\nAt t=43, at y=8, not on y=6.\n\nAnd y=8 safe at t=43.\n\nBut y=6 is unsafe at t=42 and 43, but we are not on it at those times.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=41, we are on y=6, which is safe at t=41.\n\nThen at t=42, we move to y=7, so at t=42, we are on y=7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 6 at t=41.\n\ny=6 at t=41.\n\nk=41-37=4\n\nleft(T)= -41 +6*4 = -41+24= -17\n\nright(T)= -30 +24= -6\n\nspan [-17,-6], both negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nAt t=42, k=5, left= -41+30= -11, right= -30+30=0, 0 in [-11,0], so unsafe.\n\nBut at t=42, if we were on y=6, it would be collision, but in our path, at t=42, y=7, not on y=6.\n\nSimilarly t=43, k=6, left= -41+36= -5, right= -30+36=6, 0 in [-5,6], unsafe, but we on y=8.\n\ny=8 at t=43: k=6, T=43.\n\ny=8 unsafe from t=50 to 53, which is later.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut we need to output the actions for turns starting from t_1=37.\n\nSo actions: for 7 turns, all U.\n\nBut H=7, since y_{37+7} = y_{44} =9.\n\nSequence: a_{37}, a_{38}, ..., a_{43} all U.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let me confirm if y=2 at t=37 is indeed safe.\n\nFreeway 2 at t=37: k=0\n\nFirst car: left= -47, right= -36, both <0, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: left=25, right=36, both >0, 0 not in. Safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut freeway 3 is the same, but we are not on it.\n\nIn this path, we go through y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 at t=37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44.\n\ny=6 at t=41 safe, as above.\n\nIs there a reason to take more turns? Probably not, since we can go directly.\n\nBut let me see if we need to avoid something.\n\nAt t=40, y=2 and y=3 are unsafe, but we are at y=5, so fine.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster, but cannot, since minimal 7 steps.\n\nOr slower, but no need.\n\nBut in freeway 8, unsafe later, but we are not affected.\n\nSo I think this works.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,2), which is on freeway y=2, and we move immediately.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have actions.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 44, y=9.\n\nThe sequence is from t=37 to t=43, 7 actions.\n\nH=7.\n\nBut in the box.\n\nBut let me make sure about the car on freeway 2 and 3 at t=40.\n\nFor example, if we stayed on y=2 or y=3 at t=40, collision, but we don't.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, but we pass early.\n\nAnother thing: when moving, at the turn we leave, we are still on the freeway.\n\nFor example, when we move from y=6 to y=7 at t=41: at turn t=41, we are on y=6, then we choose a_{41}=U, so y_{42}=7.\n\nAt t=41, we are on y=6, which is safe, as computed.\n\nThen at t=42, on y=7.\n\nNo collision.\n\nSimilarly all points.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8\", and we do.\n\nSo minimal H is 7.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 2 and 3 are identical, but since we go through them quickly, no problem.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster? No, 7 is minimal.\n\nSlower? No need.\n\nSo the sequence should be all U for 7 turns.\n\nBut let's write the answer.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\n}\n\nIn the sequence, it should be up to H-1? t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}\n\nHere t1=37, H=7, so a_{37} to a_{43}, that's 7 actions.\n\nAnd y_{44}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the turn labels, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut I think that's it.\n\nBut let me see if at t=43, y=8 is safe.\n\ny=8 at t=43: freeway 8, k=43-37=6\n\nleft(T)= -50 +3*6 = -50+18= -32\n\nright(T)= -39 +18= -21\n\nspan [-32,-21], both negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nUnsafe only from t=50 to 53.\n\nSo fine.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo I think no issue.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn 37. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nAnalysis of car positions and safe times for each freeway shows that:\n- Freeway 1 is safe for all turns ≥ 37.\n- Freeway 2 is unsafe only at turn 40.\n- Freeway 3 is unsafe only at turn 40.\n- Freeway 4 is safe for all turns ≥ 37 (unsafe only at turn 36).\n- Freeway 5 is safe for all turns ≥ 37 (unsafe only at turn 36).\n- Freeway 6 is unsafe at turns 42 and 43.\n- Freeway 7 is safe for all turns ≥ 37.\n- Freeway 8 is unsafe at turns 50, 51, 52, and 53 (but these are later than the minimal path).\n\nThe player can move directly upward from y=2 to y=9 in 7 turns without encountering any unsafe positions:\n- At turn 37, y=2 is safe.\n- Moving up to y=3 at turn 38 is safe (y=3 unsafe only at turn 40, but turn 38 is safe).\n- Moving up to y=4 at turn 39 is safe (y=4 safe for all ≥37).\n- Moving up to y=5 at turn 40 is safe (y=5 safe for all ≥37; y=2 and y=3 unsafe at turn 40, but player is on y=5).\n- Moving up to y=6 at turn 41 is safe (y=6 unsafe at turns 42 and 43, but turn 41 is safe).\n- Moving up to y=7 at turn 42 is safe (y=7 always safe; y=6 unsafe at turn 42, but player is on y=7).\n- Moving up to y=8 at turn 43 is safe (y=8 unsafe only later; y=6 unsafe at turn 43, but player is on y=8).\n- After moving up at turn 43, the player reaches y=9 at turn 44.\n\nThis sequence requires 7 actions (H=7) and is minimal since 7 upward moves are needed to increase y from 2 to 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- Turn 37: Move up (U) to y=3 at turn 38.\n- Turn 38: Move up (U) to y=4 at turn 39.\n- Turn 39: Move up (U) to y=5 at turn 40.\n- Turn 40: Move up (U) to y=6 at turn 41.\n- Turn 41: Move up (U) to y=7 at turn 42.\n- Turn 42: Move up (U) to y=8 at turn 43.\n- Turn 43: Move up (U) to y=9 at turn 44.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 37: U \\\\\nTurn 38: U \\\\\nTurn 39: U \\\\\nTurn 40: U \\\\\nTurn 41: U \\\\\nTurn 42: U \\\\\nTurn 43: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 38.\n\nThe player moves vertically: U for up (y increases by 1), D for down (y decreases by 1), or S for stay (y stays the same). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I have its position at turn t₁=38, and I need to compute where it will be at future turns to avoid collisions.\n\nA collision happens at turn T if the player is on a freeway y at that turn, and for some car on that freeway, the x=0 is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nImportant note: when you move to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn. So if at turn T you're on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1}, at turn T you're still on y_T for collision purposes, and you only occupy y_{T+1} starting from turn T+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9. Since we start at y=3, we need to go up to y=9, which is 6 steps up, but we might need to wait or go down sometimes to avoid cars, so it could take more turns.\n\nMinimal H without any obstacles would be 6 turns (all U actions), but with cars, it might be more.\n\nNow, let's list the cars for each freeway. Freeways are y=1 to y=8, but not all have cars; some have multiple cars.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head h=-48, tail τ=-95, direction right, speed s=48. Since direction is right, and it's moving right, so at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]? Let's check the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving cars: at turn T, span is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]? But in the rule it says:\n\nRight-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nBut in the initial state, for right-moving, it says Span(t₁) = [τ, h], which for freeway 1, it's given as (-48, -95), but head and tail: for right-moving, head should be the front, so if it's moving right, head is larger x? Let's clarify.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]  since it moves left, x decreases.\n\nRight-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]  moves right, x increases.\n\nBut in the initial Span(t₁), for left-moving it's given as (h, τ), and for right-moving as (τ, h)? No.\n\nLook at freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nNow, at t₁, for right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h]? But here h=-48, τ=-95, so τ=-95, h=-48, so Span(t₁) = [-95, -48]? But it says \"head h, tail τ\", so for right-moving, if it's moving right, head should be the right end, so h should be larger than τ.\n\nHere h=-48, τ=-95, -48 > -95, so yes, head is at -48, tail at -95, so the car spans from -95 to -48, and since direction right, it's moving to increasing x.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36), head=48, tail=83, but 48 < 83? If left-moving, head should be left end? Inconsistency.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [h, τ]\" and it moves left, so h decreases.\n\nIn freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36). If h=48, τ=83, then [h,τ] = [48,83], but since it's left-moving, head should be smaller? 48 to 83, if moving left, head at 83? I'm confused.\n\nPerhaps I misread the notation.\n\nThe table says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for left-moving, in update: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nSo at T=t₁, Span(t₁) = [h, τ]\n\nFor the car to be valid, τ should be such that the span makes sense.\n\nFor freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36). So h=48, τ=83, so at t₁, span is [48,83]. Since left-moving, it will move to decreasing x, so at T, it's [48 - sΔT, 83 - sΔT] with ΔT = T-t₁.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like freeway 1: h=-48, τ=-95, so at t₁, span [τ,h]? No, for right-moving, the update is Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so at T=t₁, ΔT=0, Span(t₁) = [τ, h] = [-95, -48].\n\nBut in the car state, it's listed as (head h, tail τ), so for right-moving, head is h, which is the right end, tail τ is left end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head is the left end, tail is the right end? In freeway 4, (48,83,left), if head is 48 and tail is 83, but 48<83, so head is smaller, which is left end for left-moving car.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo general rule:\n\n- For a car, head is the front: for right-moving, front is right; for left-moving, front is left.\n\nTail is the back.\n\nAt t₁, the span is from min to max: for right-moving, from τ to h (since τ < h for right); for left-moving, from h to τ (h < τ).\n\nIn terms of interval, it's [min, max] or what? But in collision, we care if 0 is in the closed interval I think.\n\nNow for collision: at turn T, if player is on freeway y, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in Span(T).\n\nSpan(T) is the interval at turn T.\n\nAlso, note that the grid x is infinite, I assume, or we don't care about bounds except x=0.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when there is a car such that 0 is in its span at turn T relative to t₁.\n\nLet ΔT = T - t₁, so ΔT is the number of turns after t₁.\n\nFor a car, at time T, the span depends on direction.\n\nLet s be speed, ΔT = T - t₁.\n\nFor right-moving car: Span(T) = [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT]\n\nFor left-moving car: Span(T) = [h - s ΔT, τ - s ΔT]\n\n0 is in Span(T) if for right-moving: τ + s ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + s ΔT\n\nFor left-moving: h - s ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ τ - s ΔT\n\nNow, since the player starts at y=3 at t₁, and wants to go to y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, no freeways, so no cars there. Only y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nSo we need to pass through y=4,5,6,7,8 to reach y=9.\n\nBut we can stay or move down to avoid bad times.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway, as some have multiple.\n\nFreeway k=1: one car: h=-48, τ=-95, d=right, s=48\n\nSo right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-95 + 48 ΔT, -48 + 48 ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -95 + 48 ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 48 ΔT\n\nSolve:\n\n-95 + 48 ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 48 ΔT ≤ 95 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so ΔT ≤ 1 since integer? ΔT is integer, turns.\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ -48 + 48 ΔT ⇒ 48 ΔT ≥ 48 ⇒ ΔT ≥ 1\n\nAnd -95 + 48 ΔT ≤ 0 for lower bound.\n\nSo 0 in span when ΔT ≥ 1 and ΔT ≤ 1.979, so only at ΔT=1? Let's see:\n\nAt ΔT=1: lower bound -95 +48 = -47, upper bound -48 +48=0\n\nSo Span = [-47, 0], so 0 is included, since ≤.\n\nSimilarly, at ΔT=0: Span = [-95, -48], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=2: [-95+96, -48+96] = [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision at ΔT=1 only.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24, -35, right, 12) — head h=-24, tail τ=-35, d=right, s=12\n\nRight-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-35 + 12 ΔT, -24 + 12 ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -35 +12 ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -24 +12 ΔT\n\nWhich is -35 +12 ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 12 ΔT ≤ 35 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so ΔT ≤ 2\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -24 +12 ΔT ⇒ 12 ΔT ≥ 24 ⇒ ΔT ≥ 2\n\nAlso, -35 +12 ΔT ≤ 0 for lower bound, but with ΔT≥2, at ΔT=2: lower -35+24= -11, upper -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 in.\n\nΔT=3: lower -35+36=1, upper -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only ΔT=2 for first car.\n\nSecond car on freeway 2: (48, 37, right, 12) — head h=48, tail τ=37, d=right, s=12\n\nτ=37, h=48, so Span(T) = [37 +12 ΔT, 48 +12 ΔT]\n\n0 in span? 37 +12 ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 48 +12 ΔT? But 37 +12 ΔT >0 for ΔT≥0, so never ≤0, so 0 never in span. Always positive.\n\nSo for freeway 2, only first car causes collision at ΔT=2.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"(-24, -35, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12)\" identical to freeway 2.\n\nSo similarly, only first car causes collision at ΔT=2.\n\nFreeway 4: one car: (48, 83, left, 36) — head h=48, tail τ=83, d=left, s=36\n\nLeft-moving: Span(T) = [h - s ΔT, τ - s ΔT] = [48 - 36 ΔT, 83 - 36 ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 48 -36 ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 83 -36 ΔT\n\nFirst, 0 ≤ 83 -36 ΔT ⇒ 36 ΔT ≤ 83 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so ΔT ≤ 2\n\nAnd 48 -36 ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 48 ≤ 36 ΔT ⇒ ΔT ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so ΔT ≥ 2 since integer? ΔT ≥ 2\n\nΔT ≥ ceil(1.333) =2\n\nΔT ≤ floor(2.305) =2?

Is there collision on y=3 at ΔT=0?\n\nFor freeway 3, collision at ΔT=2, not at ΔT=0, so no collision at start.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, which has no cars, so safe.\n\nThe minimal path: we need to go from y=3 to y=9, so we need to increase y by 6, but we can take S or D actions to wait.\n\nSince y=3 has collision at ΔT=2, we should not be on y=3 at ΔT=2.\n\nSimilarly, other y have issues.\n\nLet me list the safe times for each y.\n\nFor each freeway y, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., collision possible.\n\ny=1: unsafe at ΔT=1\n\ny=2: unsafe at ΔT=2\n\ny=3: unsafe at ΔT=2\n\ny=4: unsafe at ΔT=2\n\ny=5: unsafe at ΔT=2\n\ny=6: unsafe at ΔT=4,5\n\ny=7: unsafe at ΔT=12-14\n\ny=8: unsafe at ΔT=12-15\n\nFor other times, safe to be on that y.\n\nNow, player can move U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0.\n\nStart at y=3, ΔT=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some H.\n\nSince y=9 is safe always.\n\nThe direct path: all U, but let's see if possible.\n\nIf we go U each turn:\n\nStart ΔT=0, y=3\n\nAfter action a_{t1} at ΔT=0, we move to y_{t1+1} at ΔT=1.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t₁ + t for t=0,1,2,... but in the action sequence, actions are from t=0 to H-1.\n\nDefine: at time t (relative), at the start of turn t, player is at position y_t.\n\nThen action a_t is taken, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at the end of the turn, we check collision for y_t at time t? No.\n\nThe collision is checked at turn T, for the position at that turn.\n\nThe game dynamics: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the player's y position at turn T.\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but not Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut for collision at T, it depends on y_T, not where you move to.\n\nAt turn T, player is on y_T, and we check cars on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nIf you move to a different y, at turn T you are still on y_T.\n\nSo for each turn T, we have y_T, and we need that for freeway y_T, at time T, 0 not in any car span on that freeway.\n\nIn terms of ΔT, let ΔT = T - t₁.\n\nSo at each step, for time ΔT, y must be safe for that freeway at that time.\n\nStart: at ΔT=0, y=3, which is safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, actions: we choose a_t for t=0 to H-1, so at time ΔT=t, we are at y_t, and we choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t=H, we have y_H, which should be 9.\n\nt from 0 to H-1 for actions, so after H actions, time is ΔT=H, and position y_H.\n\nWe want y_H = 9.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nSince we start at y=3 and need y=9, minimal actions without obstacles is 6 U, but with obstacles, may need more.\n\nNow, the dangerous times:\n\n- At ΔT=1, y=1 is unsafe, but we are at y=3 at ΔT=0, and we move to y_{1} at ΔT=1.\n\nAt ΔT=1, we are at y_1, which depends on action at t=0.\n\nSimilarly, at ΔT=2, y_2 must be safe, etc.\n\ny=1 is only unsafe at ΔT=1, so if we are not on y=1 at ΔT=1, fine.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 unsafe at ΔT=2, y=3 unsafe at ΔT=2, y=4 unsafe at ΔT=2, y=5 unsafe at ΔT=2.\n\ny=6 unsafe at ΔT=4 and 5.\n\ny=7 and 8 unsafe from ΔT=12 to 14 and 12 to 15, which are later.\n\nSince we want minimal H, probably we can avoid the late times by going fast.\n\nFirst, the critical point is ΔT=2, where y=2,3,4,5 are all unsafe at ΔT=2.\n\nSo at ΔT=2, we cannot be on y=2,3,4,5.\n\nWe can be on y=1, but y=1 is unsafe at ΔT=1, not at ΔT=2, since for y=1, unsafe only ΔT=1.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 is safe at ΔT=2, since unsafe only at 4,5.\n\ny=7,8 safe now.\n\nAt ΔT=2, possible safe y: y=0,1,6,7,8,9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe, no freeway.\n\nBut we start from y=3.\n\nNow, at ΔT=0, we are at y=3, safe.\n\nWe choose action a_0 (for turn t1+0), which affects y at ΔT=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, to avoid being on y=2,3,4,5 at ΔT=2.\n\nAt ΔT=2, y_2 must be safe, so y_2 must be in {0,1,6,7,8,9}\n\nBut we start at y=3, so we need to move away.\n\nPossible: go up or down or stay.\n\nBut if we stay at ΔT=0, a_0=S, then y_1 = y_0 =3 at ΔT=1.\n\nAt ΔT=1, we are on y=3. Is y=3 safe at ΔT=1? From above, y=3 unsafe only at ΔT=2, not at ΔT=1. So at ΔT=1, y=3 is safe.\n\nThen at ΔT=1, we choose action a_1, which determines y at ΔT=2.\n\nNow, at ΔT=2, we need y_2 not in {2,3,4,5}, so y_2 ≤1 or y_2 >=6.\n\nBut y=1 at ΔT=2 is safe, since unsafe only at ΔT=1.\n\nSimilarly, y=0,6,7,8,9 safe.\n\nNow, from y=3 at ΔT=1, we can go to:\n\n- U: y_2=4, but 4 is unsafe at ΔT=2? y=4 unsafe at ΔT=2, so if we go to y=4 at ΔT=2, collision.\n\n- D: y_2=2, unsafe at ΔT=2.\n\n- S: y_2=3, unsafe at ΔT=2.\n\nAll three actions from y=3 at ΔT=1 lead to unsafe y at ΔT=2.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt ΔT=1, we are at y=3, and whatever we do, y_2 will be 2,3, or 4, all unsafe at ΔT=2.\n\nBut we need to be safe at ΔT=2.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=3 at ΔT=1, because from there, we are forced to an unsafe position at ΔT=2.\n\nTherefore, at ΔT=1, we must not be on y=3.\n\nThat means, at the start, ΔT=0, we cannot stay, because if a_0=S, then y_1=3 at ΔT=1, which is bad as above.\n\nSo we must move at ΔT=0.\n\nOptions: U or D.\n\nIf a_0=U, then y_1 = y_0 +1 =4 at ΔT=1.\n\nIf a_0=D, y_1=2 at ΔT=1.\n\nNow, at ΔT=1, we are on y_1.\n\nFirst case: if we go U at ΔT=0, y_1=4 at ΔT=1.\n\nIs y=4 safe at ΔT=1? y=4 unsafe only at ΔT=2, not at ΔT=1, so yes, safe at ΔT=1.\n\nThen from y=4 at ΔT=1, we need to choose a_1 to go to y_2 at ΔT=2.\n\ny_2 must be safe, so not 2,3,4,5.\n\nFrom y=4, possible actions:\n\n- U: y_2=5, but unsafe at ΔT=2\n\n- D: y_2=3, unsafe\n\n- S: y_2=4, unsafe\n\nAll lead to unsafe y at ΔT=2. Same problem.\n\nIf we go down at ΔT=0: a_0=D, then y_1=2 at ΔT=1.\n\ny=2 at ΔT=1: is it safe? y=2 unsafe only at ΔT=2, not at ΔT=1, so safe at ΔT=1.\n\nThen from y=2 at ΔT=1, choose a_1:\n\n- U: y_2=3, unsafe at ΔT=2\n\n- D: y_2=1, now y=1 at ΔT=2: is it safe? y=1 unsafe only at ΔT=1, not at ΔT=2, so at ΔT=2, y=1 is safe.\n\n- S: y_2=2, unsafe at ΔT=2\n\nSo if we go D from y=2 at ΔT=1, we go to y_2=1, which is safe at ΔT=2.\n\nThen we can proceed.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to y=1 at ΔT=2.\n\nBut y=1 is freeway, but safe at that time.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9 eventually.\n\nBut minimal turns.\n\nWe could go to higher y faster.\n\nAnother option: at ΔT=0, go down to y=2 or something.\n\nBut let's list possible paths.\n\nSince at ΔT=2, we need to be at y<=1 or y>=6.\n\ny=6 is safe at ΔT=2, since unsafe only at 4,5.\n\ny=7,8 safe.\n\nBut from start, at ΔT=0, y=3.\n\nTo reach y=6 by ΔT=2, we need to go up 3 steps in 2 turns, which requires two U actions, but from y=3 to y=6, need +3, but in two actions: from ΔT=0 to ΔT=1: if U, y=4; then ΔT=1 to ΔT=2: U, y=5, but y=5 is unsafe at ΔT=2.\n\nIf we go U,U, we reach y=5 at ΔT=2, but unsafe.\n\nTo reach y=6 at ΔT=2, we need to be at y=6 after two actions.\n\nStart: after a_0, y at ΔT=1; after a_1, y at ΔT=2.\n\nTo have y_2=6, since y_0=3, we need to increase by 3 in two steps, so actions: U and U, but y_1=4, y_2=5? No.\n\ny_0=3, a_0=U, then y_1=4 at ΔT=1\n\nThen a_1=U, y_2=5 at ΔT=2\n\nBut y=5 unsafe at ΔT=2.\n\na_0=U, a_1=S, y_2=4, unsafe.\n\na_0=S, a_1=U, y_1=3, y_2=4, unsafe.\n\nCannot reach y=6 at ΔT=2 from y=3 in two steps because max y_2=5 with U,U.\n\ny_2=5 or less, all unsafe except if we go down.\n\nBut going down: if a_0=D, y_1=2; then if a_1=D, y_2=1, which is safe.\n\nOr a_1=S, y_2=2, unsafe; a_1=U, y_2=3, unsafe.\n\nSo only by going down to y=1 at ΔT=2.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut y=1 at ΔT=2 is safe.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=6 has unsafe times at ΔT=4 and 5.\n\ny=7 and 8 have unsafe times later, but since we want min H, we can go fast to avoid those.\n\nFirst, let's go with the down path to avoid ΔT=2 issue.\n\nSo plan:\n\nAt ΔT=0: action a_0 = D, so go down to y=2? a_0 is action at turn t1+0, so from y_0=3, a_0=D, then y_1 = y_0 -1 = 2 at ΔT=1.\n\nThen at ΔT=1, we are at y=2, safe (since unsafe only at ΔT=2? At ΔT=1, y=2 is safe, yes).\n\nThen action a_1: we need to go to y_2 safe at ΔT=2.\n\nAs above, if a_1=D, y_2=1, safe.\n\nIf other, unsafe.\n\nSo a_1=D, y_2=1 at ΔT=2, safe.\n\nNow, at ΔT=2, y=1.\n\nThen we can start going up.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\ny=1 to y=9, need +8, so min 8 turns if all U, but with obstacles.\n\nNow, check other unsafe times.\n\ny=6 unsafe at ΔT=4 and 5.\n\ny=7 unsafe at ΔT=12-14, but since we are at ΔT=2 now, and if we go fast, ΔT=12 might be far, so we can ignore if H small.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nFirst, from y=1 at ΔT=2, we can go up.\n\nBut at ΔT=4 and 5, y=6 is unsafe, so we should not be on y=6 at those times.\n\nSimilarly, other y might be safe.\n\nNow, let's list the position over time.\n\nSet t=0: ΔT=0, y=3\n\na_0 = D → y_1=2 at ΔT=1\n\na_1 = D → y_2=1 at ΔT=2\n\nNow at ΔT=2, y=1\n\nNow we want to go up.\n\nNext actions: to go to y=9.\n\nAt ΔT=3, we are at y=1, choose a_2.\n\nIf a_2=U, y_3=2 at ΔT=3\n\ny=2 at ΔT=3: is it safe? y=2 unsafe only at ΔT=2, not at ΔT=3, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, if a_2=S, y_3=1, safe; or D to y=0, safe, but we want up.\n\nSo better go U.\n\na_2=U, y_3=2 at ΔT=3\n\nThen a_3: if U, y_4=3 at ΔT=4\n\ny=3 at ΔT=4: safe? y=3 unsafe only at ΔT=2, not at other times, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 unsafe only at ΔT=2, etc.\n\nAt ΔT=4, we are at y=3? Let's see.\n\nAfter a_3=U, from y_3=2, to y_4=3 at ΔT=4.\n\ny=3 at ΔT=4: safe, since only unsafe at ΔT=2.\n\nThen a_4: U to y_5=4 at ΔT=5\n\ny=4 at ΔT=5: safe? y=4 unsafe only at ΔT=2, so safe at ΔT=5.\n\nThen a_5: U to y_6=5 at ΔT=6\n\ny=5 at ΔT=6: safe, only unsafe at ΔT=2.\n\nThen a_6: U to y_7=6 at ΔT=7\n\ny=6 at ΔT=7: is it safe? y=6 unsafe at ΔT=4 and 5, not at 7, so safe.\n\nThen a_7: U to y_8=7 at ΔT=8\n\ny=7 at ΔT=8: safe? y=7 unsafe at ΔT=12,13,14, not at 8, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_8: U to y_9=8 at ΔT=9\n\ny=8 at ΔT=9: safe? unsafe at ΔT=12-15, not 9, safe.\n\nThen a_9: U to y_10=9 at ΔT=10\n\nNow y=9, reached at ΔT=10.\n\nBut is this minimal? We used 10 actions from start, including the two downs.\n\nActions: a_0 to a_9, 10 actions, reached at ΔT=10.\n\nBut perhaps we can do better by not going down.\n\nEarlier I thought to reach y>=6 at ΔT=2.\n\nBut from y=3 at ΔT=0, in two actions, max y=5, which is unsafe.\n\nWhat about going to y=0 or y=1 at ΔT=2.\n\nWe did that with two downs.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, but we have to go up from there.\n\nAnother idea: at ΔT=0, go down to y=2, but then at ΔT=1, go up to y=3, but at ΔT=2, y=3 unsafe, so not good.\n\nPerhaps stay at y=3 until after ΔT=2, but we cannot, because at ΔT=2 we must not be there.\n\nSince y=6 is safe at ΔT=2, if we can be at y=6 at ΔT=2.\n\nBut from y=3, to y=6 in two steps: impossible, since each step +1 max.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we start at 3.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=6 at ΔT=2 by having moved earlier, but at ΔT=0 we are at 3, and actions affect immediate future.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=6 at ΔT=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=7,8 impossible.\n\nSo the only safe options at ΔT=2 are y<=1.\n\nWe have to go down to y=1 or y=0 at ΔT=2.\n\nIn the path above, we went to y=1 at ΔT=2.\n\nThen from there, we went up directly, reaching y=9 at ΔT=10.\n\nBut we have y=6 unsafe at ΔT=4 and 5, but in our path, at ΔT=4, we were at y=3, not y=6; at ΔT=5, at y=4, not y=6. So we avoided it.\n\nSimilarly, later unsafe times are not reached since we finish at ΔT=10.\n\nNow, can we reach faster?\n\nMinimal without obstacles: from y=3 to y=9, 6 steps, but we had to go down first, so we added two downs, then up 8 times? From y=1 to y=9 is 8 up, but we started from y=3 down to y=1, so net we did two downs and then from y=1 to y=9: 8 ups, total 10 actions.\n\nBut the two downs were necessary to avoid ΔT=2.\n\nPerhaps we can go down only once or something.\n\nAt ΔT=0, if we go down to y=2, then at ΔT=1, we are at y=2.\n\nBut from y=2 at ΔT=1, to have safe y at ΔT=2, we must go down to y=1, as before. If we go up or stay, we go to y=3 or 2, unsafe.\n\nSo we must go to y=1 at ΔT=2.\n\nNo choice.\n\nPerhaps go to y=0.\n\nAt ΔT=0, a_0=D, y_1=2\n\nThen a_1=D, y_2=1, as before.\n\nIf a_0=D, y_1=2; then a_1=U? y_2=3, unsafe.\n\nOr a_1=S, y_2=2, unsafe.\n\nOnly D to y=1.\n\nSimilarly, if we go directly to y=0.\n\na_0=D, y_1=2\n\nThen a_1=D, y_2=1; then from y=1, we can go down to y=0 if we want, but that might be worse.\n\ny=0 is safe, but we need to go up eventually.\n\nSo going to y=1 at ΔT=2 is fine.\n\nNow, from there, in the up path, we took 8 ups to reach y=9 at ΔT=10.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach earlier by going faster up, but we are going up as fast as possible.\n\nIn the sequence: from ΔT=2, y=1\n\na_2=U, y_3=2 at ΔT=3\n\na_3=U, y_4=3 at ΔT=4\n\na_4=U, y_5=4 at ΔT=5\n\na_5=U, y_6=5 at ΔT=6\n\na_6=U, y_7=6 at ΔT=7\n\na_7=U, y_8=7 at ΔT=8\n\na_8=U, y_9=8 at ΔT=9\n\na_9=U, y_10=9 at ΔT=10\n\nNow, at ΔT=6, y=5, safe.\n\nAt ΔT=7, y=6, which is safe since unsafe only at 4 and 5.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut we have y=6 unsafe at ΔT=4 and 5, but in this path, at ΔT=4, we are at y=3, at ΔT=5, at y=4, both safe, not on y=6.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, is there a way to reach y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be at higher y at earlier time.\n\nBut at ΔT=2, we are at y=1, which is low.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to go all the way down.\n\nAnother idea: at ΔT=0, go up to y=4.\n\nBut then at ΔT=1, y=4, which is safe since only unsafe at ΔT=2? At ΔT=1, y=4 safe.\n\nThen from y=4 at ΔT=1, we need to go to safe y at ΔT=2.\n\nBut as before, all actions lead to y=3,4,5, all unsafe at ΔT=2.\n\nUnless we can jump to y=6, but cannot.\n\nSo impossible to be safe at ΔT=2 from there.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to y=2 at ΔT=0, then at ΔT=1 y=2, then must go down to y=1 at ΔT=2.\n\nNo escape.\n\nSo we must be at y<=1 at ΔT=2.\n\ny=0 or y=1.\n\nNow, from y=1 at ΔT=2, we can go up.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we reached y=9 at ΔT=10.\n\nBut ΔT=10 means H=10 actions? Let's see.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=9, that's 10 actions, but after 10 actions, we are at y_10 at ΔT=10.\n\nSince we start at t=0, after k actions, at time ΔT=k.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at ΔT=0, y=3.\n\nAfter 1 action, at ΔT=1, y_1.\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at ΔT=H, y_H.\n\nWe want y_H=9.\n\nIn the sequence, after 10 actions, y_10=9.\n\nMinimal possible: if no obstacles, from y=3 to y=9, need 6 actions: U six times, reach at ΔT=6.\n\nBut with obstacles, we had to add actions.\n\nIn this case, we added 4 extra actions? From 6 to 10, but we went down to y=1, so we have to cover that distance.\n\ny=1 to y=9 is 8 steps, plus we started from y=3 but went down to y=1, so we lost 2, then gain 8, net 6 from start, but with the downs, we used 10 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can go up faster after.\n\nBut in the sequence, we are going up as fast as possible from ΔT=2.\n\nAnother point: at ΔT=4 and 5, y=6 is unsafe, but in our path we are not on y=6 then, so fine.\n\nBut if we could be on y=6 earlier, but we can't because we start from low.\n\nFor example, suppose at ΔT=2 we are at y=1, then if we could go directly to y=6, but we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo min steps from y=1 to y=9 is 8, so at least ΔT=10 from start? From ΔT=2, we need 8 steps to y=9, so at ΔT=2 + 8 = ΔT=10, y=9.\n\nBut ΔT=10 is from start, with 10 actions.\n\nSince we start at ΔT=0, and reach at ΔT=10.\n\nBut is there a way to be at higher y at ΔT=2?\n\nFor example, if we go to y=0 at ΔT=2.\n\nBut y=0 is even lower, worse.\n\ny=0 at ΔT=2, then to y=9, need 9 steps, reach at ΔT=11, worse than 10.\n\nSo y=1 at ΔT=2 is better.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid going down by waiting at y=3 until ΔT=3 or something, but at ΔT=2 we must not be on y=3,4,etc.\n\nAt ΔT=0, if we do nothing, at ΔT=1 we are at y=3, then at ΔT=2 we must move, but all moves lead to unsafe.\n\nSo we must move at ΔT=0 to not be at y=3 at ΔT=1? No.\n\nAt ΔT=0, if we stay, y_1=3 at ΔT=1, which is safe, but then at ΔT=1, from y=3, we have to choose action for ΔT=2 position, and all choices lead to unsafe y at ΔT=2.\n\nTherefore, we must not be at y=3 at ΔT=1, because it forces us into danger.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=4 at ΔT=1, same issue.\n\nOnly by going to y=2 at ΔT=1, then we can go to y=1 at ΔT=2.\n\nNo other choice.\n\nThus, the path we have is necessary: down to y=2 at ΔT=1, down to y=1 at ΔT=2, then up all the way to y=9 at ΔT=10.\n\nBut in the up path, we have to ensure that at no point we are on unsafe y at unsafe time.\n\nIn our sequence:\n\nΔT=0: y=3, safe\n\nΔT=1: y=2, safe (since unsafe only ΔT=2? At ΔT=1, y=2 is safe)\n\nΔT=2: y=1, safe\n\nΔT=3: y=2, safe (as above)\n\nΔT=4: y=3, safe\n\nΔT=5: y=4, safe\n\nΔT=6: y=5, safe\n\nΔT=7: y=6, safe (ΔT=7, not 4 or 5)\n\nΔT=8: y=7, safe (not 12-14)\n\nΔT=9: y=8, safe\n\nΔT=10: y=9, reached\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, but we have y=6 unsafe at ΔT=4 and 5, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 unsafe later, not reached.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nFor example, from y=1 at ΔT=2, if we go up faster, but we are going max speed.\n\nPerhaps we can skip some levels, but we have to move one step at a time.\n\nAnother idea: at some point, we can go directly to y=9 without hitting unsafe times.\n\nFor instance, y=6 is unsafe at ΔT=4 and 5, but if we are on y=6 at other times, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in this case, since we start low at ΔT=2, we can't reach early.\n\nMinimal H: we must have at least 6 net up movements, but we have two down movements, so total 8 movements: 2 down and 6 up, but 2 down and 6 up from y=3 would bring us to y=3 -2 +6 =7, not 9.\n\nStart y=3, after two downs, y=1, then need 8 ups to y=9, so total actions: two downs and eight ups, 10 actions.\n\nThe net displacement is +6, but with detour.\n\nSince we must be at y<=1 at ΔT=2, and y=3 at ΔT=0, the earliest we can be at y=9 is after 8 up from y=1, so ΔT=2 +8 =10.\n\nThus, H=10 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach at ΔT=9 or less.\n\nSuppose at ΔT=2, we are at y=1.\n\nThen after k actions, at ΔT=2+k, y=1 + number of U minus number of D, but since we go up, min k=8 to reach y=9.\n\nSo at ΔT=10.\n\nIf at ΔT=2 we are at y=0, then need 9 ups, reach at ΔT=11.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo H=10 is best.\n\nNow, about the late unsafe times: y=7 unsafe at ΔT=12-14, but we are at y=7 at ΔT=8, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at ΔT=9, fine.\n\nNo issue.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions.\n\nNow, the actions are for turns starting from t1.\n\nt1 = 38.\n\nSo actions:\n\nAt turn t1 + 0: a_{t1} = D (since we go down from y=3)\n\nIn the sequence: at ΔT=0, action a_0 = D, to go to y=2 at ΔT=1.\n\nThen at turn t1 +1: a_{t1+1} = D, to go to y=1 at ΔT=2.\n\nThen at turn t1 +2: a_{t1+2} = U, to go to y=2 at ΔT=3\n\nTurn t1 +3: a_{t1+3} = U, to y=3 at ΔT=4\n\nTurn t1 +4: a_{t1+4} = U, to y=4 at ΔT=5\n\nTurn t1 +5: a_{t1+5} = U, to y=5 at ΔT=6\n\nTurn t1 +6: a_{t1+6} = U, to y=6 at ΔT=7\n\nTurn t1 +7: a_{t1+7} = U, to y=7 at ΔT=8\n\nTurn t1 +8: a_{t1+8} = U, to y=8 at ΔT=9\n\nTurn t1 +9: a_{t1+9} = U, to y=9 at ΔT=10\n\nAfter this action, at ΔT=10, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=0 to t=9, 10 actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be the sequence of actions for turns starting from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nH is the number of turns, so actions from t=0 to H-1, turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nWe reach at turn t1 + H, position after H actions.\n\nBut in the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} = 9?\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nIn the player update: after action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSet t relative to t1.\n\nAt time τ = t1 + t, for t=0,1,2,...\n\nAt τ = t1 + t, player position y_{t1 + t}\n\nThen action a_{t1 + t} is taken, then y_{t1 + t + 1} = y_{t1 + t} + Δy\n\nThe sequence {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} means actions for t=0 to H-1, so for times τ = t1 to t1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter these H actions, the position is y_{t1 + H}, because from y_{t1} to y_{t1+1} after first action, ..., to y_{t1+H} after H actions.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9? That seems inconsistent.\n\nCheck the task.\n\n\"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} is the position at time t1 + H - 1.\n\nBut after actions up to a_{t1 + H - 2}, we have y_{t1 + H - 1}.\n\nThen at time t1 + H - 1, we are at y_{t1 + H - 1}, and if it is 9, we are done, but we might not take action at that turn? Confusing.\n\nRead the task:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9)\"\n\nBut in the dynamics, the position is updated after action.\n\nPerhaps the position y_t is at the beginning of turn t.\n\nStandard in such games.\n\nAssume: at the start of turn t, player is at y_t.\n\nThen during turn t, action a_t is taken, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision checked at turn t based on y_t and car positions at t.\n\nThen, after H actions, meaning from turn t1 to t1 + H - 1, we take actions, and after the last action, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut the task says y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nLook: \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9)\"\n\nPerhaps y_{t1 + H - 1} is the position at the end of the actions.\n\nTo clarify, in the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1 for times t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H - 1}, the position becomes y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9, which is before the last action? Messy.\n\nPerhaps the index.\n\nAnother way: the actions are taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter action at turn τ, position at turn τ+1 is set.\n\nSo position at turn τ+1 depends on action at τ.\n\nWe start at turn t1, position y_{t1} given.\n\nAfter action at t1, position y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter action at t1+H-1, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at some turn, which should be after the actions.\n\nThe task says: \"reach (0,9)\" and \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nAt turn t1 + H - 1, we take action a_{t1 + H - 1}, then y_{t1 + H} = y_{t1 + H - 1} + Δy.\n\nIf y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9, and we take an action, it might move away, unless S.\n\nBut we want to reach and be at 9.\n\nPerhaps we need to have y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9, and we take no further action, so we are at 9 at that turn.\n\nIn that case, for the last turn, we are at y=9 without moving.\n\nIn our sequence, we reach y=9 at ΔT=10, which is turn t1+10.\n\nSo at turn t1+10, we are at y=9.\n\nIf we set H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9, then at turn t1 + H - 1, position is 9.\n\nIn our case, at turn t1+10, y=9.\n\nSo t1 + H - 1 = t1 +10, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nBut that includes the turn where we are already at 9.\n\nLet's think.\n\nSuppose at turn t1 + k, we are at y=9.\n\nThen we don't need to take action for that turn, since we are already there.\n\nThe sequence of actions should bring us to y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe minimal H is the number of actions to reach.\n\nIn the task, it says \"minimal number of turns H\", and \"sequence of actions for t=0 to H-1\", such that after these actions, y_{t1 + H} =9? But it says y_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nI think there might be confusion in indexing.\n\nPerhaps in the context, y_t is position at time t, and action a_t is taken at time t, updating to y_{t+1}.\n\nThen we want y_{t1 + H} =9 after H actions.\n\nBut the task says y_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nLook at the answer format: it shows actions for Turn t1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, ..., up to some turn.\n\nAnd we need to reach at turn t1 + H -1 or something.\n\nTo avoid confusion, in our sequence, we reach y=9 at turn t1 + 10.\n\nAt turn t1 + 10, position is 9.\n\nIf we consider that we take actions from turn t1 to turn t1+9, 10 actions, and at turn t1+10, we are at 9.\n\nBut for the position at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nSet t1 + H -1 = t1 +10, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nThen y_{t1 + 10} =9 for H=11.\n\nBut with H=11, we would have 11 actions, but we only need 10 to reach.\n\nPerhaps we stop when we reach.\n\nI think it's a indexing issue.\n\nIn the player update: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\", so position at t+1 depends on action at t.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t depends on y_t.\n\nWe start at turn t1, y_{t1} =3.\n\nAfter actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1 + k-1}, we have y_{t1 + k}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + k} =9 for some k.\n\nThe number of actions is k, and H = k.\n\nThen y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nBut the task says y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nPerhaps H is the number of turns including the start or something.\n\nAnother way: the sequence has H actions, for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAfter that, at turn t1+H, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut we want to reach at turn t1+H-1 or t1+H.\n\nThe task: \"reach (0,9)\" and \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo it wants position at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nThat means at the beginning of turn t1 + H -1, we are at y=9, and we may or may not take action, but since we are at 9, we can stop.\n\nIn that case, for our path, we are at y=9 at turn t1+10.\n\nSo at turn t1+10, y=9.\n\nSet t1 + H -1 = t1 +10, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nThen with H=11, we have actions from t=0 to 10, but we only need actions up to the point before we reach.\n\nIf at turn t1+10, we are at y=9, then for y_{t1 + H -1} =9, we set H-1=10, H=11, and the actions are from turn t1 to t1+10, but at turn t1+10, we are already at 9, so the action at t1+10 might be S or not needed.\n\nBut the sequence includes actions for turns up to t1+H-1.\n\nIf H=11, t1+H-1 = t1+10, so action at turn t1+10.\n\nBut at turn t1+10, if we are at y=9, we can take S or U or D, but to stay or something.\n\nSince we are already at 9, we can take S, but the action is part of the sequence.\n\nIn the minimal H, we should not include extra actions.\n\nFor example, in our case, after 10 actions, we are at y=9 at turn t1+10.\n\nSo at turn t1+10, position is 9, so for y_{t1 + H -1} =9, we need t1 + H -1 = t1+10, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nThen with H=11, we have 11 actions.\n\nBut the last action, at turn t1+10, we are at y=9, so we can take a_{t1+10} = S, for example.\n\nBut that adds an extra turn.\n\nPerhaps the sequence should bring us to 9 at the position after the last action.\n\nI think there's ambiguity, but let's look at the answer format.\n\nIt says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., and we need to specify the actions until we reach.\n\nBut in the box, we list the actions for the turns.\n\nTo be safe, let's assume that we need to have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, meaning at turn t1 + H -1, we are at 9, and we take action a_{t1 + H -1} which might move us, but to reach at that turn, we probably take no action or S.\n\nIn many games, the position is updated after action, so to be at 9 at a turn, we need to have arrived there by previous action.\n\nFor simplicity, in our sequence, with 10 actions, we reach at turn t1+10.\n\nSet H=10, then y_{t1 + H} = y_{t1+10} =9.\n\nBut the task says y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nPerhaps I should set the reach turn.\n\nLet's read the task precisely: \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAnd \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nSo for t from 0 to H-1, actions at t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThen y_{t1 + H -1} is the position at the start of turn t1 + H -1, before action a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nThen after action a_{t1 + H -1}, we get y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9, meaning that at the start of turn t1 + H -1, we are at 9, and we take some action, but since we are at 9, the action can be S to stay, or we can move, but we want to be at 9, so probably S or no action, but we have to specify action.\n\nIn this case, for us, we are at y=9 at turn t1+10.\n\nSo at start of turn t1+10, y=9.\n\nSo for y_{t1 + H -1} =9, set t1 + H -1 = t1+10, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nThen actions for t=0 to 10, turns t1 to t1+10.\n\nAt turn t1+10, y=9, so action a_{t1+10} can be S.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turns t1 to t1+9, we have actions to move there, and at t1+10, S.\n\nBut that adds an unnecessary action.\n\nTo reach at turn t1+9, for example.\n\nBut in our path, at turn t1+9, we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t1+9, we take U to go to y=9 at turn t1+10.\n\nSo at turn t1+9, y=8.\n\nIf we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9, that would be at turn t1+9 for H=10, but at t1+9, we are at 8, not 9.\n\nSo not.\n\nWith H=10, y_{t1+9} =8, not 9.\n\nTo have y_{t1+9} =9, we need to be at 9 at turn t1+9.\n\nBut in our path, we are at 8 at turn t1+9.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we go up faster from the beginning, but we can't because of the ΔT=2 constraint.\n\nFor example, at ΔT=0, a0=U, y1=4 at ΔT=1\n\nThen at ΔT=1, y=4, we must go to safe y at ΔT=2, but we can't, as before.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=9 before ΔT=10.\n\nAt ΔT=9, what is the highest we can be.\n\nAt ΔT=2, we are at y=1.\n\nThen from ΔT=2 to ΔT=9, 7 turns, we can go up 7 steps, to y=1+7=8 at ΔT=9.\n\nThen at turn t1+9, y=8.\n\nThen to be at y=9, we need to take action to go to y=9 at next turn.\n\nSo at turn t1+9, we are at y=8, take U, to y=9 at turn t1+10.\n\nIf we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9, then for turn t1+9 to be 9, we need to be at 9 at start of turn t1+9, which requires that at turn t1+8, we were at y=9 or something, but we are at y=7 at turn t1+8, etc.\n\nSo earliest at turn t1+10, y=9.\n\nTherefore, to have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, we need t1 + H -1 = t1+10, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nThen at turn t1+10, y=9, so for action at turn t1+10, we can take S.\n\nBut that seems redundant.\n\nPerhaps the task means that after H actions, we are at 9 at turn t1+H.\n\nI think it's a common mistake.\n\nLet's assume that we need to reach at the position after H actions, so y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nThen H=10.\n\nAnd in the sequence, actions for t=0 to 9.\n\nThen in the answer, list actions for turn t1 to t1+9.\n\nAnd y at t1+10=9.\n\nFor collision, at each turn, we check based on current y.\n\nIn our sequence, all good.\n\nI think for this problem, we can proceed with H=10 and the sequence.\n\nTo match the format, let's see.\n\nAnother way: in the answer format, it lists \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., and we stop when we reach.\n\nBut in the box, we list the actions until the last one before reaching or including.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps for this, we can output the sequence as per our path.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 38: D\n\nTurn 39: D\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nAfter Turn 47 action (U from y=8), at turn 48, y=9.\n\nActions from turn 38 to 47, that's 10 actions.\n\nt1=38.\n\nTurn t1=38: action\n\nTurn t1+1=39: action\n\n...\n\nTurn t1+9=47: action\n\nThen at turn 48, y=9.\n\nFor y_{t1 + H -1} =9, if H=10, t1+H-1=38+9=47, at turn 47, what is y?\n\nAt turn 47, we are at y=8 (before action), then we take action U, so y_{47} =8, not 9.\n\nSo y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{47} for H=10, which is 8, not 9.\n\nTo have y_{47} =9, we need to be at 9 at turn 47.\n\nBut at turn 47, if we are at y=9, then we don't need to move, but in the sequence, we are not.\n\nSo to have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, we must be at 9 at the start of that turn.\n\nIn our case, at turn t1+10=48, y=9.\n\nSo for turn 48 to be t1 + H -1, so 38 + H -1 =48, H-1=10, H=11.\n\nThen at turn 47, we are at y=8, take action a_{47} = U to go to y=9 at turn 48.\n\nBut at turn 47, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 47, we need to have arrived earlier.\n\nBut with the constraints, we can only be at y=8 at turn 47.\n\nFor example, if at ΔT=2, y=1, then at ΔT=9, after 7 actions, y=1+7=8 at turn t1+9=47.\n\nSo y_{47} =8.\n\nThen to be at y=9 at turn 47, impossible with this path.\n\nBut perhaps another path where we reach earlier.\n\nSuppose we don't go down, but we must.\n\nOr at some point go faster.\n\nBut we can't.\n\nPerhaps on the way up, we can skip some steps, but no, only one step per turn.\n\nSo minimal, at turn t1+10, y=9.\n\nTherefore, to have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, we can set H=11, and at turn t1+10=48, y=9, so for H=11, t1+H-1=38+10=48, so at turn 48, y=9.\n\nThen the actions include a_{48} which can be S.\n\nBut at turn 48, we are at y=9, so we take S to stay.\n\nBut that adds an action.\n\nIn the sequence, for turns 38 to 47, we have the 10 actions to move there, and at turn 48, S.\n\nBut turn 48 is t1+10.\n\nWith H=11, actions from t=0 to 10, turns 38 to 48.\n\nAt turn 48, action a_{48} = S.\n\nThen y at turn 49 is still 9, but we don't care.\n\nBut it's extra.\n\nPerhaps the task allows us to reach at the turn.\n\nI think for this problem, since it says \"reach (0,9)\", and in the context, we can assume that after the actions, we are at 9.\n\nTo be safe, I'll use the sequence with 10 actions, reaching at turn 48.\n\nAnd in the answer, list actions for turn 38 to 47.\n\nThen in the box, write the actions.\n\nThe minimal H is 10.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 38: D \\\\ Turn 39: D \\\\ Turn 40: U \\\\ Turn 41: U \\\\ Turn 42: U \\\\ Turn 43: U \\\\ Turn 44: U \\\\ Turn 45: U \\\\ Turn 46: U \\\\ Turn 47: U }\n\nAfter Turn 47 U, at turn 48, y=9.\n\nAnd H=10 turns of actions.\n\nI think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 38\\) is 10, with the sequence of actions avoiding all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Explanation of the Path:\n- At turn 38 (\\(t_1\\)), the player is at \\(y = 3\\). Moving down (D) to \\(y = 2\\) avoids being on \\(y = 3\\) at \\(\\Delta T = 1\\) (turn 39), which is safe since \\(y = 3\\) is only unsafe at \\(\\Delta T = 2\\).\n- At turn 39, the player is at \\(y = 2\\). Moving down (D) to \\(y = 1\\) ensures the position at \\(\\Delta T = 2\\) (turn 40) is safe, as \\(y = 1\\) is safe at \\(\\Delta T = 2\\) (unsafe only at \\(\\Delta T = 1\\)).\n- From turn 40 onwards, the player moves up (U) consecutively to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 48. This path avoids all unsafe times for the freeways:\n  - \\(y = 6\\) is unsafe at \\(\\Delta T = 4\\) and \\(5\\) (turns 42 and 43), but at these times, the player is at \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\) respectively, which are safe.\n  - \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are unsafe at later times (\\(\\Delta T = 12-15\\) and \\(\\Delta T = 12-15\\)), but the player reaches \\(y = 7\\) at \\(\\Delta T = 8\\) (turn 46) and \\(y = 8\\) at \\(\\Delta T = 9\\) (turn 47), which are safe.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 + t\\) from \\(t = 0\\) to \\(t = 9\\) (turns 38 to 47) is as follows:\n\n- Turn 38: D (move down to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 39)\n- Turn 39: D (move down to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 40)\n- Turn 40: U (move up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 41)\n- Turn 41: U (move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 42)\n- Turn 42: U (move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 43)\n- Turn 43: U (move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 44)\n- Turn 44: U (move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 45)\n- Turn 45: U (move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 46)\n- Turn 46: U (move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 47)\n- Turn 47: U (move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 48)\n\nAfter the action at turn 47, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 48. No collisions occur during the sequence, as verified against the car states and their movements.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 38: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 39: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 40: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 41: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 42: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 43: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 44: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 45: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 46: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 47: \\text{ U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 40 and the player is at (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, with actions from {U, D, S}, avoiding collisions.\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is at y = k (where k is between 1 and 8) then we must check the cars on freeway k at that turn. The collision occurs only if the player's x-coordinate (which is always 0) is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNote: the player moves at the same time as the cars? Actually, the update for the player happens when we choose an action, and the cars move according to their rules. Importantly, the note says: if at turn T you move to a new row (y_{T+1} != y_T), then at turn T you are still on the old row y_T, and at turn T+1 you are on the new row. So at turn T, we only check the freeway corresponding to y_T.\n\nWe are to compute the car positions at any future turn T (relative to t1) by:\n  T = t1 + t, for t>=0.\n\nFor a car given at t1 with (head, tail, direction, speed):\n  If direction is 'right': the car moves to the right as time increases. The span at time T (from t1) is:\n      [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n  But note: at t1, the car is [tail, head]? Actually, the table says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning [tail, head] and then at T: [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)].\n\n  Similarly, for left-moving: at t1: [h, tau] (which is [head, tail]?) but note the example: \n      Left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nBut wait: in the table for freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48) -> at t1, the car is given as head=-48, tail=-95? and direction right. Then for right direction, the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-95, -48]. Then at time T, it becomes [-95 + 48*(T-40), -48 + 48*(T-40)].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 4: (48,83,left,36): at t1, the car is [head, tail] = [48,83]? but that doesn't make sense because 48<83. Actually, the note says for left: \"Span(t1)=[h, tau]\" and then moves left. So if h=48, tau=83, then [48,83] and then at T: [48 - 36*(T-40), 83 - 36*(T-40)].\n\nBut note: the head is the front? So for a left-moving car, the front is at the left? Actually, the problem states: for left-moving, the car moves to the left as time increases. Therefore, the head (front) is the leftmost point? \n\nWait, let me reinterpret: \n  In the car update rules:\n    Left-moving: at t1: [h, tau] -> meaning from h to tau? but if the car moves left, then the head (front) should be the left end. So if the car is moving left, then the head is at a smaller coordinate and the tail at a larger? \n\nBut the example freeway 4: (48,83,left,36): if the car is moving left, then at t1 the head is at 48 and the tail is at 83? but that would imply the car is from 48 to 83, which is 35 units long, and then as it moves left, the head becomes 48 - 36*(T-40) and the tail becomes 83 - 36*(T-40). \n\nHowever, the condition for collision is: at turn T, we require 0 to be in [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] for left, or [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)] for right.\n\nBut note: the span must be an interval. For left-moving, if the head is at a smaller coordinate and the tail at a larger, then the interval is [head, tail]? But then when moving left, the entire car shifts left. Similarly, for right-moving, the car is [tail, head] and then moves right.\n\nBut wait: the table entry for freeway 1: head=-48, tail=-95. Then for a right-moving car, the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-95, -48]. Then at T, it becomes [-95 + 48*(T-40), -48 + 48*(T-40)]. \n\nNow, the car on freeway 2: two cars: \n  (48,37,right,12) -> wait: head=48, tail=37? then [tail, head] = [37,48] at t1. Then at T: [37+12*(T-40), 48+12*(T-40)].\n  and (0,-11,right,12) -> [tail, head] = [-11,0] at t1, then at T: [-11+12*(T-40), 0+12*(T-40)].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? \n  (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12) -> same as above.\n\nFreeway 4: (48,83,left,36) -> head=48, tail=83? so at t1: [48,83]? but wait, for left-moving the rule says: [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So at t1: [48,83] and at T: [48-36*(T-40), 83-36*(T-40)].\n\nBut note: 48<83, so the car is from 48 to 83? and moving left, so the entire car moves to lower coordinates.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 6: (-48,-59,right,6) -> [tail, head] = [-59,-48] at t1, then at T: [-59+6*(T-40), -48+6*(T-40)].\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: \n  (48,37,right,4) -> [37,48] at t1, then [37+4*(T-40), 48+4*(T-40)]\n  (0,-11,right,4) -> [-11,0] at t1, then [-11+4*(T-40),0+4*(T-40)]\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,3) -> [-59,-48] at t1, then [-59+3*(T-40),-48+3*(T-40)]\n\nOur goal: start at (0,0) at turn 40, and we want to get to (0,9). We can only move up, down, or stay. But note: we start at y=0 and want to get to y=9, so we must go up. However, we have to avoid the freeways 1 to 8 at the times when we are on them.\n\nWe need the minimal H and a sequence of actions.\n\nWe are at turn 40: y40 = 0.\n\nAt turn 40, we are at y=0. We are not on any freeway (since freeways are y=1..8), so no collision at turn 40.\n\nWe then choose an action at turn 40 for the next state.\n\nWe can model this as a BFS in the state space: state = (turn, y). But note: the turn is increasing and we want minimal H. Also, the car positions change deterministically with time.\n\nSince the grid is small (y in 0..9) and the number of turns might be bounded (because cars move and eventually might leave the x=0 region), we can try to simulate until we reach y=9.\n\nHowever, note that the cars move continuously and we only check at integer turns. The collision condition at turn T: if the player is at (0, k) with k in {1,...,8} at turn T (meaning at that turn the player is on row k) and then we check if 0 is in the span of any car on row k at that turn.\n\nWe must avoid states where at turn T, we are on a row k (1<=k<=8) and 0 is in the span of a car on that row.\n\nWe start at (40,0). We want to get to (T,9) for some T.\n\nWe can only change y by -1,0,+1 per turn, and y must stay in [0,9].\n\nWe note that we start at 0 and want to get to 9, so the minimal number of moves if there were no cars would be 9 moves (all U). But we might have to wait sometimes.\n\nWe have to compute for each freeway and for each future turn whether the car spans cover 0.\n\nLet me define the time relative to t1=40: let t = T - 40. Then at time t (>=0), the player has taken t actions (from turn40 to turn40+t-1) and is at position y_t.\n\nThe cars at relative time t (i.e., absolute turn T=40+t) are:\n\nFor each freeway k, the cars:\n\nFreeway 1: \n  One car: right-moving: \n    span = [-95 + 48*t, -48 + 48*t]\n\nFreeway 2: \n  Car1: right-moving: [37+12*t, 48+12*t]\n  Car2: right-moving: [-11+12*t, 0+12*t]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: \n  One car: left-moving: [48-36*t, 83-36*t]\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 6:\n  One car: right-moving: [-59+6*t, -48+6*t]\n\nFreeway 7:\n  Car1: [37+4*t, 48+4*t]\n  Car2: [-11+4*t, 0+4*t]\n\nFreeway 8:\n  One car: right-moving: [-59+3*t, -48+3*t]\n\nWe are interested in when 0 is in these spans for the respective freeway.\n\nFor example, for freeway 1 at time t: \n  0 in [-95+48t, -48+48t] \n  => -95+48t <= 0 <= -48+48t\n  => 48t <= 95 and 48t >= 48\n  => t>=1 and t<=95/48 ≈ 1.979 -> so t=1? \n\nCheck: at t=1: [-95+48, -48+48] = [-47,0] -> 0 is included? yes, at the upper bound.\nBut note: the interval is inclusive? yes, since it's a span.\n\nSo at t=1 (absolute turn 41), if the player is on freeway 1 (y=1), then collision.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2:\n  Car1: 0 in [37+12t, 48+12t] -> \n      37+12t <= 0 <= 48+12t -> but 37+12t>=37>0 for t>=0 -> never.\n  Car2: 0 in [-11+12t, 0+12t] = [-11+12t, 12t]\n      -> -11+12t <= 0 <= 12t\n      -> 12t>=0 (always for t>=0) and 12t<=11 -> t<=11/12 ≈ 0.916 -> so only t=0? \n      At t=0: [ -11, 0] -> 0 is included? yes.\n\nBut at t=0 (absolute turn 40) we are at y=0, so we don't check freeway 2? because we are not on freeway 2 at turn40.\n\nSo for freeway2, the dangerous time for car2 is only t=0? but we are not on that freeway at t=0. Then for t>=1, car2: \n  At t=1: [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12]. \n  So freeway2 is safe for t>=1? \n\nBut wait, car1: never dangerous because 37+12t>0 for t>=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3: same as freeway2.\n\nFreeway4: \n  [48-36t, 83-36t] contains 0?\n  48-36t <= 0 <= 83-36t\n  => 36t>=48 -> t>=48/36=4/3≈1.333 -> t>=2\n  and 36t<=83 -> t<=83/36≈2.305 -> so t=2?\n  Check t=2: [48-72,83-72] = [-24,11] -> 0 in [-24,11] -> yes.\n\n  t=3: [48-108,83-108] = [-60,-25] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway4 is dangerous at t=2.\n\nFreeway5: same as freeway4 -> dangerous at t=2.\n\nFreeway6:\n  [-59+6t, -48+6t] contains 0?\n  => -59+6t<=0<=-48+6t\n  => 6t<=59 -> t<=59/6≈9.833\n  and 6t>=48 -> t>=8\n  So t from 8 to 9 (inclusive) since t integer?\n  Check t=8: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> 0 included? yes.\n  t=9: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6] -> 0 included? yes.\n  t=10: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> no.\n\nSo freeway6 dangerous at t=8,9.\n\nFreeway7:\n  Car1: [37+4t,48+4t] -> 37+4t>0 always -> never.\n  Car2: [-11+4t, 0+4t] = [-11+4t, 4t] -> contains 0?\n        -11+4t<=0<=4t -> 4t<=11 -> t<=11/4=2.75, and 4t>=0 -> so t=0,1,2?\n        t=0: [-11,0] -> 0 included -> dangerous at t=0? but we are not on freeway7 at t0.\n        t=1: [-7,4] -> 0 included? yes.\n        t=2: [-3,8] -> 0 included? yes.\n        t=3: [1,12] -> no.\n\nSo freeway7 dangerous at t=1,2.\n\nFreeway8:\n  [-59+3t, -48+3t] contains 0?\n  => -59+3t<=0<=-48+3t\n  => 3t>=48 -> t>=16\n      3t<=59 -> t<=19 (since 3*19=57, 3*20=60>59)\n  Check t=16: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> 0 included? yes.\n  t=17: [-59+51, -48+51] = [-8,3] -> yes.\n  t=18: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6] -> yes.\n  t=19: [-59+57, -48+57] = [-2,9] -> yes.\n  t=20: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> no.\n\nSo freeway8 dangerous at t=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow, we need to move from y0=0 at t=0 (absolute 40) to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nWe are at y=0 at t0. We can move to y=1 at t1 (by action U at t0) or stay at y=0 (S) or even move down? but that would be counterproductive.\n\nBut note: we must avoid the freeways at the times we are on them.\n\nLet me denote the state (t, y) where t is the relative time (number of steps from 40) and y is the vertical position.\n\nWe start at (0,0). We wish to achieve y=9.\n\nWe can simulate:\n\nWe are at (0,0). We choose an action for the next state.\n\nWe have to avoid:\n\nFor freeway1: dangerous at t=1 (if we are at y=1 at t=1) -> we cannot be at y=1 at relative time t=1.\n\nFor freeway2: dangerous at t=0? but we are not on freeway2 at t0. And for t>=1, freeway2 is safe? so we can be on freeway2 at t>=1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3: same as freeway2.\n\nFreeway4: dangerous at t=2 -> if we are at y=4 at t=2, then collision.\n\nFreeway5: same, dangerous at t=2.\n\nFreeway6: dangerous at t=8,9.\n\nFreeway7: dangerous at t=1,2.\n\nFreeway8: dangerous at t=16,17,18,19.\n\nSo the immediate dangers:\n\nAt t=1: we cannot be at y=1 (freeway1) and also we cannot be at freeway7 (y=7) because freeway7 is dangerous at t=1? but at t=1, if we are at y=7, then we check freeway7: which is dangerous at t=1 -> so we cannot be at y=7 at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, at t=2: we cannot be at y=4 (freeway4) or y=5 (freeway5) or y=7 (freeway7).\n\nWe can try to move up as quickly as possible, but we have to avoid these.\n\nMinimal H: we need at least 9 moves (if we go up every time). So H_min=9? But we might have to wait.\n\nLet's try to go up every time:\n\nt0 (relative time 0): at y0=0 -> safe (not on freeway)\n  action: U -> then at t1 (relative time 1): y1=1.\n\nBut at t1, y1=1: we are on freeway1 -> and freeway1 is dangerous at t1 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot do U at t0 to get to y=1 at t1.\n\nSo we must avoid being at y=1 at t1.\n\nWhat if we stay at t0? \n  action: S -> then at t1: y1=0 -> safe (y=0 is safe always? because not a freeway).\n\nThen at t1 (relative time 1): we are at (1,0). Now we can choose an action.\n\nBut note: at t1, if we go up to y=1 at t2 (relative time 2), then we check freeway1 at t2: \n  freeway1 at t2: [ -95+48*2, -48+48*2] = [-95+96, -48+96] = [1,48] -> 0 not in [1,48] -> safe.\n\nSo we can go to y=1 at t2.\n\nBut then we also have to consider freeway7 at t2: but we are not at y=7 at t2.\n\nSo plan:\n\nt0 (absolute40): S -> then at t1 (absolute41): still at y=0.\nt1: U -> then at t2: y=1 -> safe? as above.\n\nThen we can continue going up:\n\nt2: U -> y=2 at t3.\n\nAt t3: y=2 -> freeway2? freeway2 is safe at all t>=1 -> so safe.\n\nt3: U -> y=3 at t4 -> freeway3: safe at t4 (>=1) -> safe.\n\nt4: U -> y=4 at t5.\n\nBut at t5: relative time 5? we have to check freeway4: \n  freeway4 at t5: [48-36*5, 83-36*5] = [48-180, 83-180] = [-132,-97] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nBut wait, we are at t5 (relative time 5) and freeway4 was dangerous at t=2. But we are at y=4 at t5 -> we check freeway4 at t5 -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5 same.\n\nBut what about freeway7? at t5: we are at y=4, so we don't check freeway7.\n\nSo safe.\n\nt5: U -> y=5 at t6 -> freeway5: same as freeway4 at t6: [48-36*6,83-36*6]=[48-216,83-216]=[-168,-133] -> safe.\n\nt6: U -> y=6 at t7 -> freeway6: at t7: [-59+6*7, -48+6*7] = [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nt7: U -> y=7 at t8.\n\nAt t8: freeway7: dangerous at t=1,2? but t8>2 -> freeway7 at t8: \n  Car1: [37+4*8,48+4*8]=[37+32,48+32]=[69,80] -> safe.\n  Car2: [-11+4*8,0+4*8]=[-11+32,32]=[21,32] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway7 safe at t8.\n\nt8: U -> y=8 at t9 -> freeway8: at t9: [-59+3*9, -48+3*9]=[-59+27,-48+27]=[-32,-21] -> safe.\n\nt9: U -> y=9 at t10 -> we reached goal at relative time t=10 (absolute turn 50).\n\nTotal turns: H=10 (from t0 to t9: 10 actions? Actually, we take 10 actions: at absolute turns 40 to 49, and at the end of the 10th action (at turn49) we are at y=9? \n\nLet me clarify:\n\nAt turn40 (t0 relative): we start at y0=0 and take an action for the next state.\nAfter the action at turn40, we are at turn41: y1 = y0 + delta.\n\nSo:\n  turn40: action S -> then at turn41: y=0.\n  turn41: action U -> then at turn42: y=1.\n  turn42: U -> turn43: y=2.\n  turn43: U -> turn44: y=3.\n  turn44: U -> turn45: y=4.\n  turn45: U -> turn46: y=5.\n  turn46: U -> turn47: y=6.\n  turn47: U -> turn48: y=7.\n  turn48: U -> turn49: y=8.\n  turn49: U -> turn50: y=9.\n\nBut we are required to have the last action at turn t1+H-1 and then we are at (0,9). So H=10 actions: from turn40 to turn49, and then at turn50 we are at y=9.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning for t from 0 to H-1, the action at turn t1+t.\n\nSo at turn40 (t=0) to turn40+H-1 (t=H-1). Then at the next turn (turn40+H) we have the position after the last action. So we require that at turn40+H, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn our case, we want to be at (0,9) at turn40+H. We started at turn40 at (0,0). We did H actions: the last action at turn40+H-1, and then at turn40+H we are at (0,9).\n\nIn our plan, we have:\n  After 10 actions (at turn40+9 = turn49) we are at y=8? Then we take the 10th action (U) at turn49 and then at turn50 (which is 40+10) we are at y=9.\n\nSo H=10.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWe lost one turn by staying at the beginning. Can we avoid that?\n\nAlternative: at t0, instead of staying, we might go down? but that would be worse.\n\nOr: at t0, we go up? but then at t1 we are at y=1 -> collision.\n\nSo we must avoid y=1 at t1.\n\nWhat if we go up at t0 to y=1 at t1? but that causes collision.\n\nUnless we can skip the freeway? but we can't because we are forced to be at y=1 at t1.\n\nSo we must wait at least one turn at the beginning.\n\nBut is there a way to get to y=9 in 9 moves? We need 9 moves of U to go from 0 to 9. But if we do 9 consecutive U, we would be:\n\nt0: U -> t1: y=1 -> collision at t1.\n\nSo we must insert at least one non-up move? and that would make at least 10 moves.\n\nSo minimal H is 10.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in 10 without the initial stay? \n\nAnother idea: what if we go up twice? but we cannot at the beginning because of the collision at t1.\n\nAlternatively, we might take a detour? but that would take more moves.\n\nSo the plan above is minimal.\n\nBut wait: in the plan above, we have:\n\n  turn40: S -> then y remains 0 at turn41.\n  then we go up 9 times: from turn41 to turn49: 9 U's -> then at turn50 we are at y=9.\n\nTotal actions: 10.\n\nBut let me verify the entire path for collisions:\n\nAt each turn T (absolute) and the state we are in at that turn (after the action of the previous turn? actually, at the start of the turn we are at a position, and then we choose an action that will update the position at the next turn.\n\nBut the collision check is at the current turn: at turn T, we are at (0,y_T). And we check the freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nWe start at turn40: (0,0) -> safe (not freeway).\n\nThen we do action S at turn40: so at turn41, we are at (0,0) -> safe.\n\nThen action U at turn41: so at turn42, we are at (0,1). Now we check freeway1 at turn42 (absolute turn42, relative t=2): \n  freeway1: [ -95+48*(42-40)= -95+96=1, -48+96=48] -> [1,48] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nThen at turn42: action U -> at turn43: y=2 -> check freeway2 at turn43 (t=3): \n  freeway2: car1: [37+12*3=37+36=73,48+36=84] -> safe.\n            car2: [-11+12*3=-11+36=25, 0+36=36] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn43: action U -> turn44: y=3 -> freeway3: same as freeway2 at t=4? \n  Actually, relative time: at turn44: t=4 -> freeway3: \n      car1: [37+12*4=37+48=85,48+48=96] -> safe.\n      car2: [-11+12*4=37,48] -> safe.\n\nThen turn44: U -> turn45: y=4 -> freeway4 at turn45 (t=5): [48-36*5,83-36*5]=[48-180,83-180]=[-132,-97] -> safe.\n\nThen turn45: U -> turn46: y=5 -> freeway5: same as freeway4 at t=6: [48-36*6,83-36*6]=[48-216,83-216]=[-168,-133] -> safe.\n\nThen turn46: U -> turn47: y=6 -> freeway6 at t=7: [-59+6*7, -48+42]=[-17,-6] -> safe.\n\nThen turn47: U -> turn48: y=7 -> freeway7 at t=8: \n  car1: [37+4*8=37+32=69,48+32=80] -> safe.\n  car2: [-11+32=21,32] -> safe.\n\nThen turn48: U -> turn49: y=8 -> freeway8 at t=9: [-59+3*9, -48+27]=[-32,-21] -> safe.\n\nThen turn49: U -> turn50: y=9 -> goal, and we don't check freeway for y=9.\n\nSo the entire path is safe.\n\nIs there a way with H=9? \n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn40+9=49.\n\nSo we must have taken 9 actions starting at turn40 to turn48.\n\nWe start at turn40: (0,0). Then after 9 actions, at turn49 we are at (0,9).\n\nThe sequence of y: \n  turn40: y0=0\n  turn41: y1 = y0 + a0\n  ...\n  turn49: y9 = y8 + a8\n\nWe require y9=9.\n\nThe total upward moves must be 9, and no downward moves? because we start at 0 and need to go to 9. So we need exactly 9 U's and 0 D's? and then the number of S's would be 0? so we must do 9 U's in a row.\n\nBut then:\n  turn40: U -> turn41: y=1 -> collision at freeway1 (as at t1 relative, which is turn41) -> so we cannot.\n\nIf we do 8 U's and 1 S? then we end at 8? not 9.\n\nOr 9 U's and some D? then we end at less than 9.\n\nSo it is impossible in 9 moves.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=10.\n\nThe sequence:\n\nTurn40: S\nTurn41: U\nTurn42: U\nTurn43: U\nTurn44: U\nTurn45: U\nTurn46: U\nTurn47: U\nTurn48: U\nTurn49: U\n\nBut note: the last action (at turn49) leads to y=9 at turn50.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to list the actions from turn40 to turn40+H-1, which is turn40 to turn49.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn40: S\nTurn41: U\nTurn42: U\nTurn43: U\nTurn44: U\nTurn45: U\nTurn46: U\nTurn47: U\nTurn48: U\nTurn49: U\n\nBut wait: we have 10 actions. The last one (at turn49) is U, which is the 10th action.\n\nBut note: the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: \n  a_{t1} = a_{40} (t=0)\n  a_{41} (t=1)\n  ...\n  a_{49} (t=9) -> which is the 10th action? because t from 0 to 9 is 10 actions.\n\nYes.\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 40: S\nTurn 41: U\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\n}\n\nBut wait, we have 10 lines? from turn40 to turn49.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, so H=10, then t=0,...,9 -> 10 actions.\n\nSo this is correct.\n\nBut note: in the answer format, we write:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n...\nTurn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nHere t1=40, H=10, so last turn is 40+9=49.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 40: S\nTurn 41: U\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\n\nBut we must check if we can do it without the initial stay? we concluded no.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way that we go up at the beginning and then avoid freeway1 by going down? but that would take more moves.\n\nSo this is minimal.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid freeway7 at t=1 and t=2. In our plan, we are at y=1 at turn42 (t=2 relative) and then we are at y=2 at turn43 (t=3) and so on. We are never at freeway7 at the dangerous times? because at t=1 (turn41) we are at y=0, and at t=2 (turn42) we are at y=1, and at t=3 (turn43) we are at y=2, etc. So we avoid freeway7 at t=1 and t=2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 40\\) is 10.

The collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in the span of a car on the freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U) to y+1, down (D) to y-1, or stay (S) to keep y the same. But y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nI need to reach y=9, so I have to move up at least 9 times, but I might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, which could add extra turns. Since I start at y=0 and need to get to y=9, the minimum H without any obstacles would be 9 turns, all U actions. But with cars, I might need more.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states for each freeway. Each freeway has one or more cars, and I need to know when any car on that freeway has 0 in its span at a given turn.\n\nThe car spans move with constant speed. For left-moving cars, the span shifts left (decreasing x), for right-moving, it shifts right (increasing x).\n\nThe span at turn T is given based on turn t_1=41.\n\nSo for each car, I need to find for which T, 0 is in [h - s*(T-41), τ - s*(T-41)] for left-moving, or [τ + s*(T-41), h + s*(T-41)] for right-moving? Let's see the notation.\n\nFor left-moving: span at T is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut in the car state, head h and tail τ are given at t_1. For left-moving, if head is at h and tail at τ, and it's moving left, so at T, head is at h - s(T-t_1), tail at τ - s(T-t_1). Since it's moving left, h should be greater than τ, I assume? The span is from head to tail, but direction indicates movement.\n\nIn the car state, for left-moving, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and span is [h, τ], but if it's moving left, h should be the right end? I think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook: for left-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nBut if it's moving left, and [h, τ] is the span at t_1, then h must be the left end or right end? Typically, head might be the front.\n\nPerhaps it's better not to assume; let's use the given.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nFor right-moving, at t_1, span is [τ, h], so τ is left, h is right, I think? Because when moving right, left end is τ, right end is h, and both increase.\n\nIn the update, for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)], so τ and h are both at t_1.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)], so at t_1, it's [h, τ].\n\nBut for left-moving, if it's moving left, the head should be the left end, I think? But here it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for left-moving, span is [h, τ], which might have h > τ or h < τ? Probably we should consider the values.\n\nFor example, on freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nDirection is right, so at t_1, span is [τ, h] = [-47, 0], I think? From the car state: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor this one: head h=0, tail τ=-47, direction right, speed 48.\n\nAnd for right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-47, 0]\n\nThen at turn T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-47 + 48(T-41), 0 + 48(T-41)] = [48(T-41) -47, 48(T-41)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\n0 is in the span if min <= 0 <= max.\n\nFor this car, 0 is in [48(T-41) -47, 48(T-41)] when 48(T-41) -47 <= 0 <= 48(T-41)\n\nSince 48(T-41) -47 <= 0 <= 48(T-41) implies that 0 <= 48(T-41) and 48(T-41) -47 <= 0, so 48(T-41) <= 47? Let's solve inequalities.\n\n48(T-41) -47 <= 0 <= 48(T-41)\n\nThe right inequality: 0 <= 48(T-41) implies T-41 >= 0, so T >= 41\n\nLeft inequality: 48(T-41) -47 <= 0 implies 48(T-41) <= 47, so T-41 <= 47/48 < 1, so T-41 <= 0 since T integer? T-41 is integer, 47/48 <1, so T-41 <= 0.\n\nThus T-41 <= 0 and T-41 >=0, so T-41=0, T=41.\n\nAt T=41, 48(0) -47 = -47 <=0 <=0, yes 0 is in [-47,0].\n\nFor T>41, 48(T-41) >=48>0, so 0 <= 48(T-41) only if T-41=0, but for T>41, 48(T-41) >0, and lower bound 48(T-41)-47, which for T=42 is 48-47=1>0, so span [1,48], 0 not in. Similarly for T<41, but T>=t_1? We start from t_1=41, so only T=41 has collision on freeway 1, but at T=41, we are at y=0, not on freeway 1, freeway 1 is y=1.\n\nCollision occurs if we are on freeway y_T at turn T and 0 in span for that freeway.\n\nAt turn T, we are on row y_T, and if there is a car on that row with 0 in its span at T.\n\nFor freeway 1, y=1, at T=41, span is [ -47, 0 ] for that car, so 0 is included, so if we are on y=1 at T=41, we collide, but we start at T=41 on y=0, so not on y=1.\n\nNow for other turns, for T>41, on freeway 1, the span is [48(T-41)-47, 48(T-41)], which for T>41, min is at least 48-47=1>0 for T=42, so 0 not in span for any T>41 on freeway 1. So freeway 1 is safe for T>41.\n\nSimilarly, for T<41, but we start at T=41, so no issue.\n\nNow freeway 2: has two cars: (60,49, right,12) and (12,1, right,12)\n\nBoth right-moving, speed 12.\n\nFirst car: head h=60, tail τ=49, direction right, so at t_1, span [τ, h] = [49,60]\n\nAt T, [49 + 12(T-41), 60 + 12(T-41)]\n\n0 in this if 49 +12(T-41) <=0 <=60+12(T-41)\n\nSince 49 +12(T-41) >=49>0 for T>=41, so min>0, 0 not <= min, so never 0 in span for this car.\n\nSimilarly, second car: head h=12, tail τ=1, direction right, span at t_1 [τ,h] = [1,12]\n\nAt T, [1 +12(T-41), 12+12(T-41)]\n\nMin =1+12(T-41) >=1>0 for T>=41, so always min>0, 0 not in span.\n\nSo for freeway 2, no car ever has 0 in span for T>=41. So safe at all times.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Cars: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12) same as freeway 2.\n\nSo also safe.\n\nNow freeway 4: (12,47, left,36)\n\nDirection left, so at t_1, span [h,τ] = [12,47]? Head h=12, tail τ=47.\n\nAnd moving left, so at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)] = [12 -36(T-41), 47-36(T-41)]\n\n0 in span when min <=0<= max, so 12 -36(T-41) <=0 <=47-36(T-41)\n\nNow, 0 <=47-36(T-41) implies 36(T-41) <=47, so T-41 <= 47/36 ≈1.305, so T-41 <=1 since integer.\n\nSimilarly, 12-36(T-41) <=0 implies 12 <=36(T-41), so T-41 >= 12/36=1/3, so T-41 >=1 since integer.\n\nThus T-41 >=1 and T-41 <=1, so T-41=1, T=42.\n\nAt T=42, min =12-36(1) =12-36=-24 <=0, max=47-36=11, 0 between -24 and 11, yes.\n\nFor other T, not.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as freeway 4? (12,47,left,36), same, so only at T=42, 0 in span.\n\nNow freeway 6: (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nDirection right, head h=-42, tail τ=-53, so at t_1, span [τ,h] = [-53,-42]\n\nAt T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-53 +6(T-41), -42 +6(T-41)]\n\n0 in this if -53 +6(T-41) <=0 <= -42 +6(T-41)\n\nLeft: -53 +6(T-41) <=0 implies 6(T-41) <=53, T-41 <=53/6≈8.833, T<=49\n\nRight: 0 <= -42 +6(T-41) implies 42 <=6(T-41), so T-41 >=42/6=7, T>=48\n\nSo for T from 48 to 49 inclusive.\n\nT-41 >=7 and T-41 <=8.833, so T-41=7 or 8, T=48 or 49.\n\nAt T=48, min=-53+6(7)= -53+42= -11 <=0, max=-42+42=0, so 0 in [-11,0], yes.\n\nAt T=49, min=-53+48= -5? T-41=8, min=-53+6*8=-53+48=-5, max=-42+48=6, 0 in [-5,6], yes.\n\nT=50, min=-53+54=1>0, not.\n\nSo on freeway 6, collision at T=48 and 49.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars: (52,41,right,4) and (4,-7,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head 52, tail 41, right, span at t_1 [41,52]\n\nAt T, [41+4(T-41), 52+4(T-41)]\n\nMin=41+4(T-41) >=41>0 for T>=41, so 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: head 4, tail -7, right, span at t_1 [τ,h] = [-7,4]\n\nAt T, [-7 +4(T-41), 4 +4(T-41)]\n\n0 in this if -7 +4(T-41) <=0 <= 4 +4(T-41)\n\nLeft: -7+4(T-41) <=0 implies 4(T-41) <=7, T-41 <=7/4=1.75, T<=42.75, so T<=42\n\nRight: 0 <=4 +4(T-41) implies -4 <=4(T-41), always true for T>=41? 0 <=4 +4(T-41) for T>=41, since 4(T-41)>=0, so yes.\n\nBut left inequality: -7+4(T-41) <=0\n\nFor T=41: -7+0 = -7 <=0, true; 0 <=4+0=4, true, so 0 in [-7,4]\n\nT=42: -7+4(1)= -3 <=0, 0 <=4+4=8, true.\n\nT=43: -7+8=1>0, so min=1>0, 0 not <= min, not in.\n\nSo for second car, 0 in span at T=41 and T=42.\n\nFirst car no, so on freeway 7, collision at T=41 and T=42.\n\nNow freeway 8: (-45,-56,right,3)\n\nDirection right, head h=-45, tail τ=-56, span at t_1 [τ,h] = [-56,-45]\n\nAt T, [-56 +3(T-41), -45 +3(T-41)]\n\n0 in this if -56 +3(T-41) <=0 <= -45 +3(T-41)\n\nLeft: -56+3(T-41) <=0 implies 3(T-41) <=56, T-41 <=56/3≈18.666, T<=59.666, T<=59\n\nRight: 0 <= -45 +3(T-41) implies 45 <=3(T-41), T-41 >=15, T>=56\n\nSo T from 56 to 59 inclusive? T-41 >=15 and T-41 <=18.666, so T-41=15,16,17,18, T=56,57,58,59.\n\nAt T=56, min=-56+3*15=-56+45=-11<=0, max=-45+45=0, 0 in.\n\nT=57, min=-56+48=-8<=0, max=-45+48=3, 0 in.\n\nT=58, min=-56+51=-5<=0, max=-45+51=6, 0 in.\n\nT=59, min=-56+54=-2<=0, max=-45+54=9, 0 in.\n\nT=60, min=-56+57=1>0, not.\n\nSo collision on freeway 8 at T=56,57,58,59.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when collision occurs at x=0:\n\n- y=1: only at T=41 (from car)\n\n- y=2: never\n\n- y=3: never\n\n- y=4: at T=42 (from car)\n\n- y=5: at T=42 (same as y=4)\n\n- y=6: at T=48 and 49\n\n- y=7: at T=41 and 42\n\n- y=8: at T=56 to 59\n\nAlso, y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so safe always.\n\nWe start at T=41, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe minimal H might be 9 if we can go straight up without colliding.\n\nBut let's see if we can go from y=0 to y=9 in 9 turns, starting from T=41.\n\nAt each turn T, we choose action, which determines y_{T+1}, but we are at y_T at turn T.\n\nSequence: at turn T, we are at position (0, y_T), then we choose action a_T, which sets Δy for the turn, so y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are at (0, y_{T+1}).\n\nCollision at turn T if we are on y_T and y_T has a car with 0 in span at T.\n\nFor T=41, we are at y=0, which has no cars, so safe.\n\nNow, we need to be on y=1 to y=8 only when no collision on that row at that turn.\n\nStart: T=41, y=0, safe.\n\nAfter action a_41, y_{42} = y_41 + Δy_41 = 0 + Δy, so we move to y_{42} at T=42.\n\nAt T=42, we are at y_{42}, and so on.\n\nI should list the forbidden (y,T) pairs.\n\nFor each freeway, the dangerous turns:\n\ny=1: T=41\n\nBut at T=41, we are on y=0, not y=1, so for y=1, dangerous only at T=41, but since we are not on it then, it might be safe to be on y=1 at other times.\n\ny=1 has cars only at T=41 dangerous, other times safe? From above, freeway 1 only dangerous at T=41, so for T≠41, y=1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2: always safe.\n\ny=3: always safe.\n\ny=4: dangerous at T=42\n\ny=5: dangerous at T=42\n\ny=6: dangerous at T=48,49\n\ny=7: dangerous at T=41,42\n\ny=8: dangerous at T=56,57,58,59\n\nNow, we need to go from y=0 at T=41 to y=9 at some T.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0, or +1.\n\nWe must increase y from 0 to 9, so net +9, but with possible stays or downs, but to minimize turns, we should avoid downs and minimize stays.\n\nMinimal H is 9 if all up.\n\nBut let's see if we can do U all the way.\n\nStart: T=41, y=0\n\nAfter a_41: if U, then y_42 =1\n\nAt T=42, we are at y=1.\n\nBut y=1 at T=42: is it dangerous? From above, y=1 only dangerous at T=41, not at T=42, so safe.\n\nThen at T=42, we choose a_42.\n\nIf we go to y=2, at T=43, y=2 is always safe.\n\nSimilarly, to y=3 at T=44, safe.\n\nThen to y=4 at T=45.\n\ny=4 dangerous only at T=42, but T=45 ≠42, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, to y=5 at T=46, dangerous only T=42, safe.\n\nThen to y=6 at T=47.\n\ny=6 dangerous at T=48,49, not 47, so safe.\n\nThen to y=7 at T=48.\n\ny=7 dangerous at T=41 and 42, not 48, so safe? T=48, y=7.\n\ny=7 dangerous at T=41,42, and T=48 is later, not dangerous, so safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at T=49.\n\ny=8 dangerous at T=56-59, not 49, so safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at T=50.\n\ny=9 no cars, safe.\n\nSo with all U actions, we reach y=9 at T=50, with H=9 turns? Let's see the turns.\n\nT=41: start y=0, action a_41, to y_42\n\nT=42: at y_42, action a_42, to y_43\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence: from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -1, with actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and position at turn T is y_T.\n\nAt turn T=t_1, y_{t_1} = given, here 0.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, we have y_{t_1 + H} = y_{t_1} + sum of Δy from t=t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThe position at the turn after last action is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nAnd we need to reach (0,9), so y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nFor H=9, we start at T=41, y=0.\n\nAfter 9 actions: a_41 to a_49, then at T=50, y_50 =9.\n\nNow, during the path:\n\nT=41: y=0, safe\n\nAfter a_41=U, y_42=1\n\nT=42: y=1, which is safe because y=1 dangerous only at T=41, not 42.\n\nThen a_42=U, y_43=2\n\nT=43: y=2, safe\n\na_43=U, y_44=3\n\nT=44: y=3, safe\n\na_44=U, y_45=4\n\nT=45: y=4, dangerous only at T=42, not 45, safe\n\na_45=U, y_46=5\n\nT=46: y=5, dangerous only T=42, not 46, safe\n\na_46=U, y_47=6\n\nT=47: y=6, dangerous at T=48,49, not 47, safe\n\na_47=U, y_48=7\n\nT=48: y=7, dangerous at T=41,42, not 48, safe\n\na_48=U, y_49=8\n\nT=49: y=8, dangerous at T=56-59, not 49, safe\n\na_49=U, y_50=9\n\nT=50: y=9, safe, and we reached.\n\nSo with all U actions from T=41 to T=49, we reach y=9 at T=50.\n\nH=9 turns, actions a_41 to a_49 all U.\n\nBut is there a problem at T=42?\n\nAt T=42, we are at y=1, which is safe.\n\nBut y=4 and y=5 are dangerous at T=42, but we are not on them at T=42.\n\nAt T=42, we are on y=1, which is safe.\n\ny=7 dangerous at T=42, but we are on y=1, not y=7.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo it seems we can go straight up in 9 turns.\n\nBut let me confirm the dangerous times again.\n\nFor y=4: only dangerous at T=42\n\nWe are on y=4 at T=45, which is not 42, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=5 at T=46, safe.\n\ny=6 at T=47, safe, not 48 or 49.\n\ny=7 at T=48, safe, not 41 or 42.\n\ny=8 at T=49, safe, not 56-59.\n\nAnd we start at y=0 T=41, end at y=9 T=50.\n\nAll actions U.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence for turns starting from t_1=41.\n\nSo actions: a_41 = U, a_42=U, ..., a_49=U.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H -1 =41 +9 -1=49, we take action, and y_{50}=9.\n\nH=9.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer? H=9 is minimum since we need to increase by 9.\n\nWe start at y=0, need to reach y=9, each U increases by 1, S or D doesn't help to increase, so minimum 9 actions, all U, if possible.\n\nHere it seems possible.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=7 dangerous at T=41 and 42, but we are not on it then.\n\nIn the sequence, when we go to y=7 at T=48, it's fine.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7, y=7, dangerous at T=41 and T=42.\n\nAt T=41, we are at y=0.\n\nAt T=42, we are at y=1, not y=7.\n\nSo when we are on y=7 at T=48, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we need to avoid being on certain rows at certain times, but in this case, no conflict.\n\nMaybe for y=6, dangerous at T=48 and 49, but we are on y=6 at T=47, which is before, safe.\n\nThen move to y=7 at T=48.\n\nAt T=48, we are on y=7, which is safe, not dangerous.\n\ny=7 dangerous only at T=41,42.\n\nT=48 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at T=49, safe.\n\nSo I think H=9 is achievable.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence.\n\nPerhaps I need to output for each turn.\n\nBut the question says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case H=9.\n\nBut let me see if we can reach earlier.\n\nWith all U, we reach at T=50.\n\nCan we reach before T=50?\n\nStart T=41 y=0.\n\nAfter first action, at T=42, y could be 1 if U, or 0 if S, or -1 but y min 0, so D not possible from y=0? y_{t+1} in [0,9], so from y=0, D not possible, only S or U.\n\nSimilarly, from y=9, U not possible.\n\nBut here, to reach faster, we need to increase faster, but we can only increase by 1 per turn, so from 0 to 9, minimum 9 actions, so earliest at T=50.\n\nT=41: after 0 actions, y=0\n\nAfter 1 action: T=42, y=1 if U\n\n...\n\nAfter 9 actions: T=50, y=9\n\nSo T=50 is the earliest possible.\n\nAnd we achieved it.\n\nPerhaps we can stay or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, all actions U.\n\nBut let me confirm the collision note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nIn our case, when we move, at turn T, we are on y_T, and we might be moving to y_{T+1}, but we are only considered on y_T at turn T for collision.\n\nIn the sequence, no issue.\n\nFor example, at T=42, we are on y=1, and freeway y=1 has no car at x=0 except at T=41, but T=42, no issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 4 and 5 at T=42, but we are not on y=4 or 5 at T=42.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with all U actions.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nThen at turn 50, y=9.\n\nNow, in the answer format, it should be from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so turns 41 to 49, actions a_41 to a_49.\n\nEach with U.\n\nNow, the boxed answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", let's see.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor t=0, a_{t_1}, t=1, a_{t_1+1}, ..., t=H-1, a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nThen after that, at turn t_1 + H, y =9.\n\nFor H=9, actions at t=41 to 49.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to list each turn.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\n...\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nIn the format.\n\nBut perhaps I should write it.\n\nBut is there any mistake?\n\nAnother thing: freeway 6 has cars at T=48,49, but we are on y=6 at T=47, and y=7 at T=48, y=8 at T=49.\n\nAt T=48, y=7, which is safe.\n\nAt T=49, y=8, safe.\n\nBut if we were on y=6 at T=48, it would be dangerous, but we are not.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, dangerous later, but not at T=49.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 7 at T=41 and 42.\n\nBut not relevant.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we can go faster, but we can't.\n\nOr with stays, but that increases H.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought about the note: when moving, we are not on the next row until next turn.\n\nBut in this case, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps at T=41, if we stay, but that delays.\n\nNo need.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 41\\) is 9. The sequence of actions consists of all \"U\" (up) moves, which increment the y-coordinate by 1 each turn without any collisions with cars on the freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Verification of Path and Collision Avoidance:\n- **Turn 41 (y=0)**: Action U moves to y=1 at turn 42. Safe, as y=0 has no cars.\n- **Turn 42 (y=1)**: Action U moves to y=2 at turn 43. Safe, as y=1 is only dangerous at turn 41, not turn 42.\n- **Turn 43 (y=2)**: Action U moves to y=3 at turn 44. Safe, as y=2 has no dangerous turns.\n- **Turn 44 (y=3)**: Action U moves to y=4 at turn 45. Safe, as y=3 has no dangerous turns.\n- **Turn 45 (y=4)**: Action U moves to y=5 at turn 46. Safe, as y=4 is only dangerous at turn 42, not turn 45.\n- **Turn 46 (y=5)**: Action U moves to y=6 at turn 47. Safe, as y=5 is only dangerous at turn 42, not turn 46.\n- **Turn 47 (y=6)**: Action U moves to y=7 at turn 48. Safe, as y=6 is dangerous at turns 48 and 49, but not turn 47.\n- **Turn 48 (y=7)**: Action U moves to y=8 at turn 49. Safe, as y=7 is dangerous at turns 41 and 42, not turn 48.\n- **Turn 49 (y=8)**: Action U moves to y=9 at turn 50. Safe, as y=8 is dangerous at turns 56–59, not turn 49, and y=9 has no cars.\n\nAt turn 50, the position is \\((0, 9)\\), achieving the goal in 9 turns with no collisions.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 = 41\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 49\\) is all \"U\":\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 41: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 42: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 43: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 44: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 45: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 46: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 47: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 48: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: & U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 42, and I start at y=1. I have three actions: U (up, increase y by 1), D (down, decrease y by 1), or S (stay, y doesn't change). But since I need to reach y=9, and I'm at y=1, I should mostly go up.\n\nThe cars are moving, and I need to avoid being on a freeway where a car covers position x=0 at the turn I'm on that row. Importantly, when I move to a new row, I'm not considered on that row until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1. Similarly for down or stay.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, I'm on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span is given by the head and tail positions, which move with speed s in the direction.\n\nFirst, I need to model where the cars are at each turn relative to t_1=42.\n\nLet me denote the turn number. Since t_1=42 is the current turn, for any future turn T, the time elapsed is Δt = T - 42.\n\nFor each car, given its state at t_1, I can find its span at time T.\n\nThe car state is given for each freeway. Freeways are y=1 to y=8, and for each, there are one or more cars listed.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: (head=48, tail=1, direction=right, speed=48)\n\nDirection right means it's moving right, so since head is greater than tail? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving cars: span at t_1 is [τ, h], and at time T, span is [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left: [h, τ] at t_1, becomes [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)] at T.\n\nIn the state, for freeway 1: (48, 1, right, 48)\n\nSince it's right-moving, at t_1, span is [τ, h] = [1, 48]? But it says (head, tail, dir, speed), and for right, head should be the front, so if moving right, head is right, tail is left, so span is [tail, head] for right-moving? Let's read carefully.\n\nThe state says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for update:\n\nLeft-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nRight-moving: span(t_1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nFor left-moving, at t_1, span is [h, τ], which implies h is the left end (head towards left), τ is right end? That might be confusing.\n\nTypically, head is the front, so for left-moving, head is left, for right-moving, head is right.\n\nIn the notation:\n\nFor left-moving car: span(t_1) = [h, τ], and since moving left, at T, both decrease by s Δt.\n\nFor right-moving: span(t_1) = [τ, h], meaning τ is left, h is right, and at T, both increase by s Δt.\n\nIn freeway 1: (48, 1, right, 48)\n\nSince right, span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [1, 48]\n\nAt time T, span is [1 + 48*(T-42), 48 + 48*(T-42)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, I am on row y_T, and for that row, there is a car with 0 in its span at T.\n\nBut I need to be on y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars there, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe, and I need to end there.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, only y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, I start from (0,1), and go to (0,9).\n\nIn the position, it's (x,y), but x is always 0 for the player, I think, since we're moving vertically? No, the player is at (0,y), and we move vertically, while cars move horizontally on rows y=1 to 8.\n\nCars are on fixed rows, moving left or right, and we move vertically between rows.\n\nAt each turn, we choose to go up, down, or stay, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must be in 0 to 9.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to know when it is safe to be on that row, i.e., when no car has 0 in its span.\n\nSince multiple cars per row, I need for each row, the times when 0 is not covered by any car on that row.\n\nThen, when I plan my path, I need that for each turn T, when I am on y_T, y_T must be safe at that turn.\n\nAlso, since I move at each turn, the row changes only after the move.\n\nLet me denote the turn from t=42 onwards.\n\nAt turn 42, I am at y=1.\n\nI choose an action a_{42}, which affects y_{43}.\n\nLet's see the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, I choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nPosition at turn t is (0, y_t).\n\nThen I choose a_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, I am on row y_T, and collision if for freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nIn this case, at turn T, y_T is fixed, and we check cars on that row at that turn.\n\nNow, when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, I choose a_T, which sets y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I am on y_T, so I need y_T to be safe at T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nI need to reach a turn where y_T = 9 for some T, and at that turn, since y=9 has no cars, it should be safe, but we need to be at (0,9), which is not a freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe, but we start from y=1.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when some car covers x=0.\n\nThen I can model the safe times for each row.\n\nThen, I need to find a sequence of moves from y=1 to y=9 in min turns, such that at each turn, the row I'm on is safe at that time.\n\nSince I start at turn 42 on y=1, and I need to end on y=9 at some turn.\n\nLet me first compute for each row the set of turns where it is unsafe.\n\nTurns are integers, I assume, since we move in discrete turns.\n\nFirst, for each car, find when it covers x=0.\n\nFor a car, at turn T, it covers x=0 if min(span) <= 0 <= max(span).\n\nFor a given car, let s be speed, Δt = T - 42.\n\nFor left-moving car: span at T is [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nIt covers 0 if h - s Δt <= 0 <= τ - s Δt\n\nSince for left-moving, h is left, τ is right, so h <= τ, and span is [h, τ] decreasing, so min is h - s Δt, max is τ - s Δt.\n\n0 covered if h - s Δt <= 0 <= τ - s Δt\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: span at T is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt], min τ + s Δt, max h + s Δt, so 0 covered if τ + s Δt <= 0 <= h + s Δt\n\nNow, for each freeway, there might be multiple cars, so for the row to be unsafe, if any car covers 0 at that turn.\n\nSafe when no car covers 0.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per row.\n\nFirst, freeway 1 (y=1): only one car: (h=48, τ=1, d=right, s=48)\n\nRight-moving, so at T, span [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [1 + 48 Δt, 48 + 48 Δt]\n\n0 covered if 1 + 48 Δt <= 0 <= 48 + 48 Δt\n\nSince Δt = T-42, and T>=42, Δt >=0, so 1 + 48 Δt >=1 >0, so left inequality 1 + 48 Δt <=0 is false since 1+48Δt >=1 >0. Thus, 0 is never covered? 1 + 48 Δt <=0 implies Δt <= -1/48, impossible for Δt>=0. Similarly, 0 <= 48 + 48 Δt always true since positive. But the condition is τ + s Δt <= 0 <= h + s Δt, which is 1 + 48 Δt <= 0 and 0 <= 48 + 48 Δt. But 1 + 48 Δt <=0 is never true for Δt>=0, so 0 is never in the span. So this car never covers x=0 at any T>=42.\n\nAt T=42, span [1,48], 0 not in, since 1>0. At later times, span moves right, min increases, so always min >=1 >0, so 0 never covered. So freeway 1 is always safe for all T>=42.\n\nIs that right? Car is at [1,48] at t=42, moving right, so it only covers x>=1, never x=0, since min is 1. Yes, so y=1 is always safe.\n\nNow, freeway 2 (y=2): two cars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nThis is right-moving, so span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48] because τ is tail, h is head, and since right, τ left, h right, so [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T, span: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-59 + 12 Δt, -48 + 12 Δt]\n\nCovers 0 if -59 + 12 Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 12 Δt\n\nSimilarly, second car: (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nState: head=24, tail=13, direction=right, speed=12\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [13, 24]\n\nAt T: [13 + 12 Δt, 24 + 12 Δt]\n\nCovers 0 if 13 + 12 Δt <= 0 <= 24 + 12 Δt\n\nBut 13 + 12 Δt >=13>0 for Δt>=0, so 13+12Δt <=0 impossible, thus never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, first car: covers 0 if -59 + 12 Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 12 Δt\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n-59 + 12 Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 12 Δt\n\nFirst: -59 + 12 Δt <= 0 => 12 Δt <= 59 => Δt <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so Δt <=4 since integer? Δt integer, turns.\n\nT integer, Δt integer.\n\nΔt <= floor(59/12) = floor(4.916) =4\n\n12 Δt <=59, Δt <= 59/12=4.916, so Δt <=4\n\nAnd second inequality: 0 <= -48 + 12 Δt => 12 Δt >=48 => Δt >=4\n\nSo Δt >=4 and Δt <=4, so only at Δt=4.\n\nThus, at Δt=4, T=42+4=46, span: -59+12*4= -59+48= -11, and -48+12*4= -48+48=0, so [ -11, 0], so 0 is covered, yes.\n\nOtherwise, not.\n\nSo car 1 covers 0 only at T=46.\n\nCar 2 never covers 0.\n\nSo for y=2, unsafe only at T=46.\n\nSafe for all other T.\n\nNow freeway 3 (y=3): same as y=2? \"3 | (−48,−59,right,12),(24,13,right,12) \"\n\nIdentical to y=2, so same thing: unsafe only at T=46.\n\nNow freeway 4 (y=4): \"4 | (−24,11,left,36) \"\n\nOne car: head=-24, tail=11, direction=left, speed=36.\n\nLeft-moving, so span at t_1: [h, τ] = [-24, 11]  // since left, h left, τ right\n\nAt T: [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] = [-24 - 36 Δt, 11 - 36 Δt]\n\nCovers 0 if -24 -36 Δt <= 0 <= 11 -36 Δt\n\nNow, -24 -36 Δt <= 0 always true since negative? -24 -36 Δt <=0, which is -36 Δt <=24, multiply both sides by -1, reverse inequality: 36 Δt >= -24, always true for Δt>=0.\n\nBut the condition is min <=0 <= max.\n\nMin is h - s Δt = -24 -36 Δt <=0 always for Δt>=0? -24 -36 Δt, for Δt=0, -24<0, decreases, so always negative, so min <=0 always true.\n\nMax is τ - s Δt =11 -36 Δt\n\n0 <= max means 0 <= 11 -36 Δt, so 36 Δt <=11, Δt <=11/36≈0.305, so for Δt=0 only?

No.\n\nFrom the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nLet's read:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t with a_t.\n\nAt turn t_1, position is (0, y_{t_1})\n\nAfter applying actions a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to a_{t_1 + H-1}, we have H actions.\n\nThe position after H actions is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut we need to reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1, y_{t_1} =1.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + k-1}, at turn t_1 + k, y_{t_1 + k} = y_{t_1} + sum of Δy from t= t_1 to t_1+k-1\n\nWe need that at some turn T, y_T =9, and T = t_1 + H -1 for some H.\n\nT = t_1 + H -1, so H = T - t_1 +1\n\nSince t_1=42, T=42 + H -1\n\ny_T =9.\n\nAnd for each turn s from t_1 to T-1, we need that at turn s, y_s is safe, because we are on that row at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, we are on y_T=9, which is safe.\n\nIn the sequence, for turns from 42 to T-1, we are on some row between 0 and 9, and it must be safe at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, we are on y=9, safe.\n\nNow, T = 42 + H -1\n\nMinimal H means minimal T, since t_1 fixed.\n\nBut T depends on how we move.\n\nThe minimal possible T: if we go up every turn, from y=1 at t=42, after 0 up, y=1; after 1 up at t=43, y=2; ... after 7 ups, at t=49, y=8? Let's see:\n\nAt t=42, y=1\n\na_{42} = U, then at t=43, y=2\n\na_{43}=U, t=44, y=3\n\n...\n\nUp to a_{48}=U, t=49, y=7? Start y=1 at t=42.\n\nAfter k up moves, y=1+k\n\nSet 1+k=9, k=8.\n\nSo after 8 up moves, y=9.\n\nFirst action a_{42}, after that t=43, y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{49}, t=50, y=9? Let's index:\n\nTurn 42: y=1\n\nAction a_{42}: after action, turn 43, y= y_{42} + Δy, if U, y=2\n\nSimilarly, a_{43}: turn 44, y=3\n\n...\n\na_{48}: turn 49, y= 1 +7? From t=42 to t=43: after a_{42}, y_{43}=2\n\nt=43 to t=44: after a_{43}, y_{44}=3\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{48}, turn 49, y_{49} = y_{48} + Δy, but y_{48} = ? After 6 up moves from start.\n\nAt turn 42: y=1\n\nAfter 1 action (a_{42}), turn 43, y=2 if U\n\nAfter 2 actions, turn 44, y=3\n\n...\n\nAfter m actions, turn 42+m, y=1+m\n\nSet 1+m=9, m=8, so at turn 42+8=50, y=9.\n\nAnd we reach at turn T=50, which is t_1 + H -1? t_1=42, T=50, so 50 = 42 + H -1 => H-1=8, H=9? No.\n\nT = t_1 + H -1 =42 + H -1\n\nSet to 50, so 42 + H -1 =50 => H-1=8, H=9.\n\nNumber of actions: H actions from t= t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nSequence {a_t for t= t_1 to t_1+H-1}, H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut we need to be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nFrom the problem: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd the sequence is actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nAt turn t_1, before any action, position is (0, y_{t_1})\n\nAfter applying a_{t_1}, we go to turn t_1+1 with y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{a_{t_1}}\n\nAfter applying a_{t_1+H-1}, we go to turn t_1 + H with y_{t_1+H} = y_{t_1} + sum Δy\n\nBut we need that at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9)\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y_{t_1 + H -1}, which is set by previous actions.\n\nThe position at turn s is y_s, which depends on actions up to s-1.\n\nFor turn s, y_s is determined by actions from t_1 to s-1.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd this is achieved by actions from t_1 to (t_1 + H -1) -1? Let's think.\n\nThe actions are applied at turns t_1 to t_1+H-1, each affecting the next turn's position.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At turn t_1: position y_{t_1}, choose a_{t_1}, which sets y_{t_1+1}\n\n- At turn t_1+1: position y_{t_1+1}, choose a_{t_1+1}, sets y_{t_1+2}\n\n- ...\n- At turn t_1 + H -1: position y_{t_1 + H -1}, choose a_{t_1 + H -1}, which sets y_{t_1 + H}\n\nBut we need that at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo at the turn when we choose the last action, we are already at y=9, and the last action might be S or something, but since we are at 9, we can stay or move, but to reach 9, we need to be at 9 at that turn.\n\nThe actions lead us to be at y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, with min moves: start t=42, y=1.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at turn T, with T=42 + H -1.\n\nAfter 8 up moves, we can be at y=9 at turn 50, since:\n\nt=42: y=1\n\na_{42}=U: t=43, y=2\n\na_{43}=U: t=44, y=3\n\n...\na_{48}=U: t=49, y=8? After 7 actions: from t=42 to t=49, that's 7 actions: a42 to a48, turn 43 to 49, y from 2 to 8 at t=49.\n\ny at t=43:2, t=44:3, ..., t=49:8\n\nThen at t=49, y=8, we choose a_{49}=U, then at t=50, y=9.\n\nBut we need to be at y=9 at turn T= t_1 + H -1.\n\nHere t_1=42, at turn 50, y=9, so T=50.\n\n50 = 42 + H -1 => H-1=8, H=9 actions.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from a_{42} to a_{50}, but a_{50} is at turn 50, which sets y_{51}, but we don't care.\n\nWe need actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{42 +9 -1} = a_{50}, but at turn 50, we are at y=9, and we choose a_{50}, which might be S or whatever, but since we have reached, we can choose S.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to specify actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nFor min H, with 8 up moves, we reach y=9 at turn 50 with actions from t=42 to t=49: 8 actions? Let's count.\n\nActions: a_{42} to a_{49}, that's 8 actions: indices from 42 to 49 inclusive, that's 8 actions.\n\nThen after a_{49}, at turn 50, y=9.\n\nSo at turn 50, we are at y=9.\n\nNow, turn 50 is t_1 + H -1? t_1=42, H=8, t_1 + H -1 =42+8-1=49, but at turn 49, we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nMistake.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =42 + H -1\n\nSet equal to 50, so 42 + H -1 =50, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nThen actions from a_{42} to a_{42+9-1} = a_{50}.\n\nAt turn 50, we are at y=9 (from previous action), and we choose a_{50}, but since we are already at 9, a_{50} could be S, and it doesn't change position.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H -1 =50, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nWith 8 up moves, we need 9 actions to be at y=9 at turn 50: actions a42 to a49 to go from y1 to y9, and a50 to be at turn 50 with y9.\n\nBut a50 is the last action, and at turn 50, we are at y9 before choosing a50? No.\n\nAt turn t, we are at position, then we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn 50, if we are at y9, it means that from turn 49, we were at y8, and chose U, so at turn 50, y=9.\n\nThen at turn 50, we are at y9, and we can choose a50=S or U or D, but since we need to be at y9 at turn t_1+H-1, and with H=9, t_1+H-1=50, so at turn 50, y=9, perfect.\n\nAnd a50 can be S, for example.\n\nSimilarly, for min time, we can have H=9 with 8 up and one stay or something, but in this case, with 8 up and one S at the end.\n\nBut we can reach at turn 50 with y9.\n\nNow, back to the problem.\n\nI need to go from y=1 at t=42 to y=9 at some T, with T as small as possible, but avoiding unsafe rows at each turn.\n\nThe unsafe times:\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: unsafe at t=46\n\ny=3: unsafe at t=46\n\ny=4: unsafe at t=42\n\ny=5: unsafe at t=42\n\ny=6: unsafe at t=48,49\n\ny=7: unsafe at t=42\n\ny=8: unsafe at t=56,57,58,59\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nI start at t=42 on y=1, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nIf I go directly up, I would be:\n\nt=42: y=1\n\nt=43: y=2 (if U)\n\nt=44: y=3\n\nt=45: y=4\n\nt=46: y=5\n\nt=47: y=6\n\nt=48: y=7\n\nt=49: y=8\n\nt=50: y=9\n\nNow, check safety at each turn:\n\nt=42: y=1, safe\n\nt=43: y=2, is it safe? y=2 unsafe only at t=46, but t=43 is not 46, so safe.\n\nt=44: y=3, unsafe only at t=46, t=44≠46, safe.\n\nt=45: y=4, y=4 unsafe at t=42, t=45≠42, safe.\n\nt=46: y=5, y=5 unsafe at t=42, not t=46, so safe? y=5 unsafe only at t=42, as per above.\n\ny=5: same as y=4, unsafe only at t=42.\n\nt=46 is not 42, so safe.\n\nBut at t=46, y=5, which is safe.\n\nNow t=47: y=6, y=6 unsafe at t=48 and 49, t=47 not, so safe.\n\nt=48: y=7, y=7 unsafe at t=42, not t=48, so safe.\n\ny=7 unsafe only at t=42.\n\nt=49: y=8, y=8 unsafe at t=56-59, not t=49, so safe.\n\nt=50: y=9, safe.\n\nIn this path, all turns are safe? But at t=46, I am on y=5, which is safe, and y=2 and y=3 are unsafe at t=46, but I am not on them at t=46.\n\nAt t=46, I am on y=5, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=48 and 49, but at t=48, I am on y=7, not y=6; at t=49, I am on y=8, not y=6.\n\nSo in this direct path, I never occupy an unsafe row at the wrong time.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At t=46, y=2 and y=3 are unsafe, but I am on y=5, safe.\n\n- At t=48, y=6 unsafe, but I am on y=7, safe.\n\n- At t=49, y=6 unsafe, but I am on y=8, safe.\n\n- At t=42, y=4,5,7 unsafe, but I am on y=1, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nAnd I reach at t=50 with y=9.\n\nBut is there a faster way? To reach earlier.\n\nMinimal time: from y=1, to y=9, need at least 8 moves up, so cannot be earlier than t=50.\n\nt=50 is the earliest possible.\n\nAnd with this path, it works.\n\nBut let me confirm the actions.\n\nStart t=42: at y=1, choose a_{42}=U, go to y=2 at t=43\n\nt=43: at y=2, choose a_{43}=U, go to y=3 at t=44\n\nt=44: at y=3, choose a_{44}=U, go to y=4 at t=45\n\nt=45: at y=4, choose a_{45}=U, go to y=5 at t=46\n\nt=46: at y=5, choose a_{46}=U, go to y=6 at t=47\n\nt=47: at y=6, choose a_{47}=U, go to y=7 at t=48\n\nt=48: at y=7, choose a_{48}=U, go to y=8 at t=49\n\nt=49: at y=8, choose a_{49}=U, go to y=9 at t=50\n\nNow, at turn t=50, y=9, which is when we need to reach, turn t_1 + H -1 =42 + H -1=50, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions from a_{42} to a_{49}, that's 8 actions? a_{42} to a_{49} is 8 actions: t=42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49.\n\nThen at turn 50, y=9.\n\nBut the sequence should include actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{42 + H -1}\n\nWith H=9, a_{42+8} = a_{50}\n\nBut at turn 50, we are at y=9, and we need to specify a_{50}, which can be S, for example, to stay.\n\nThen at turn 50, we are at y=9.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence, we have 9 actions.\n\nBut in the min path, we used 8 U actions to go up, and then one S at the end.\n\nWe could have a_{49} to go to y=9 at t=50, and no need for a_{50}, but according to the problem, we need to specify actions until we reach, and H includes the turns.\n\nSince we need to be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1, and with actions up to a_{t_1 + H -2}, we set y_{t_1 + H -1}, but at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at position, and we also choose an action, but the position is already set.\n\nIn this case, for H=9, t_1 + H -1=50, we need to be at y=9 at turn 50.\n\nWith the 8 U actions from t=42 to t=49, we are at y=9 at turn 50.\n\nThen at turn 50, we choose a_{50}, which can be S, and we are done.\n\nIf we don't want the extra action, we could reach earlier? But we cannot reach before t=50, since at t=42 y=1, each move increases turn, so min turn to y=9 is t=50.\n\nt=50 is turn 50.\n\nPerhaps with staying or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo min H is 9, with actions U from t=42 to t=49, and S at t=50? But t=50 action is not needed for moving, but to satisfy the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, for t=50, we specify a_{50}=S.\n\nBut in the path above, at t=49, we go to y=9 at t=50, so at turn 50, y=9.\n\nNow, in the unsafe times, we don't have issues.\n\nBut let me double-check if at any point I am on an unsafe row.\n\nFor example, at t=46, I am on y=5. Is y=5 safe at t=46? Yes, only unsafe at t=42.\n\nSimilarly, at t=48, y=7, safe, only unsafe at t=42.\n\nBut y=6 is unsafe at t=48 and 49, but I am not on y=6 at those times.\n\nAt t=47, I am on y=6, and t=47, is it safe? y=6 unsafe at t=48 and 49, not t=47, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=49 I am on y=8, safe.\n\nt=48 y=7, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut in freeway 7, y=7, there is a car that covers at t=42, but I am not on it at t=42.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo this seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut let me see if I can go faster, but I don't think so.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to y=0 and up, but that would take more turns, since y=0 to y=9 is 9 steps, but from y=1, down to y=0 is one step down, then up to y=9, 9 steps, total 10 actions, worse.\n\nOr staying, but that delays.\n\nSo min is 8 up moves, reaching at t=50 with H=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions: a42 to a49 should be U, and a50=S.\n\nBut a50 is the action at turn 50, which we set to S.\n\nSince we reach at turn 50, and the action at turn 50 doesn't affect the position for that turn, it sets the next, but we don't care.\n\nIn the answer, we need to specify.\n\nBut let me see the car on y=6.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=48 and 49.\n\nIn my path, at t=48, I am on y=7, not y=6.\n\nAt t=49, on y=8.\n\nAt t=47, on y=6, which is safe.\n\nIs there any other constraint?\n\ny=8 unsafe from t=56 to 59, but I am on y=8 at t=49, which is fine.\n\nSo all clear.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=9, with actions: U at t=42, U at t=43, ..., U at t=49, and S at t=50? t=50 is a_{50}, but the sequence is for turns from t_1 to t_1+H-1, which is t=42 to 50 for H=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =42+9-1=50.\n\nActions: a_{42} to a_{50}.\n\na_{42} to a_{49}: U\n\na_{50}: S (since we are at y=9, stay)\n\nWe could have a_{50} as U or D, but S is fine.\n\nIn the output, it should be the actions.\n\nBut in the path, with a_{42} to a_{49} all U, we reach y=9 at t=50, so at turn 50, we are at y=9, and we choose a_{50}=S.\n\nThe sequence is for actions at those turns.\n\nNow, but in the freeway, for y=2 and y=3, unsafe at t=46, but I am not on them at t=46, so ok.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on y=2.\n\nAt t=46, y=2 is unsafe, but in my path, at t=46, I am on y=5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut is there a problem with y=6?\n\nAnother thing: when I move, the row I move to, I am not on it until next turn.\n\nBut in this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can have a shorter path if I avoid rows at certain times, but since min is 8 moves, I cannot do better.\n\nSuppose I stay at some point to avoid, but that would increase time.\n\nFor example, if I had to avoid t=46 on y=2 or 3, but in this path, I am not on them at that time.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with actions all U from t=42 to t=49, and S at t=50.\n\nt=49 action: at t=49, I go to y=9 at t=50.\n\nThen a_{50}=S.\n\nNow, in the sequence:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{42} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{43} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 +7: a_{49} = U\n\nThen Turn t_1 +8: a_{50} = S\n\nt_1 + H -1 = t_1 +8 for the last turn? H=9, t_1 + H -1 =42+9-1=50.\n\nThe actions are for t from t_1 to t_1+H-1, i.e., t=42 to 50.\n\nIndex: t= t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so t=42 to 42+H-1.\n\nWith H=9, t=42 to 50.\n\na_{42} to a_{50}.\n\na_{42} to a_{49}: U\n\na_{50}: S\n\nIn the output format:\n\nTurn 42: a_{42} = U\n\nTurn 43: a_{43} = U\n\n...\n\nTurn 49: a_{49} = U\n\nTurn 50: a_{50} = S\n\nBut turn 50 is t_1 + 8, since t_1=42, 42+8=50.\n\nt from 0 to H-1=8, so t_1 + t for t=0:42, t=1:43, ..., t=8:50.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, for t=50, action S.\n\nSince we are at y=9, it doesn't matter.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nPerhaps I can have only 8 actions, but then I reach at turn 50, but at turn t_1 + H -1 with H=8, t_1 + H -1=42+8-1=49, but at turn 49, in the direct path, I am at y=8, not y=9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 49, I need to have reached earlier, but I start at y=1 at t=42, so at turn 49, y=1+ (49-42) = 1+7=8 if all up, or less if down or stay, so cannot be at y=9 at turn 49. Min at turn 50.\n\nSo H=9 is min.\n\nThus, the sequence should be U for turns 42 to 49, and S for turn 50.\n\nBut turn 50 is included.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 7, there is a car (8,-3,right,4) which covers 0 at t=42, but I am not on y=7 at t=42.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nBut let me write the answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8\", and I think I have.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if moving affects, but I think not.\n\nAnother point: when I move to a new row, I am not on it until next turn, so for example, if I move to y at turn T, I am on y at turn T+1.\n\nBut in collision, it is only at the turn I am on the row.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=9.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: S\n\nIn the output, it should be for turns starting from t_1.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on y=6.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=48 and 49.\n\nIn my path, at t=48, I am on y=7, which is safe.\n\nAt t=49, on y=8, safe.\n\nAt t=47, on y=6, which is safe since t=47 not 48 or 49.\n\nt=47 is safe for y=6.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can go slower to avoid something, but no need.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 42\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs only if, at turn \\(T\\), the player is on a freeway row \\(y_T\\) and a car on that row has position 0 within its span at that turn.\n\n### Analysis of Safe and Unsafe Times for Each Freeway\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Always safe for all turns \\(T \\geq 42\\), as the car (head=48, tail=1, direction=right, speed=48) never covers position 0 (span min >= 1).\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Unsafe only at turn 46 due to car (-48, -59, right, 12) covering position 0.\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Identical to freeway 2, unsafe only at turn 46.\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Unsafe only at turn 42 due to car (-24, 11, left, 36) covering position 0.\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Identical to freeway 4, unsafe only at turn 42.\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Unsafe at turns 48 and 49 due to car (-36, -47, right, 6) covering position 0.\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Unsafe only at turn 42 due to car (8, -3, right, 4) covering position 0 (the other car (56, 45, right, 4) never covers 0).\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Unsafe at turns 56 to 59 due to car (-42, -53, right, 3) covering position 0.\n- **y=0 and y=9**: No freeways, always safe.\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) Minimally\nThe minimal number of turns to reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 1\\) is 8 upward moves, taking 8 turns (from turn 43 to turn 50). However, the sequence must include actions from turn \\(t_1 = 42\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1\\), where \\(H\\) is the number of actions, and the position at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1\\) must be (0, 9).\n\n- At turn 42: Start at \\(y = 1\\).\n- After 8 upward actions (U) at turns 42 to 49, the position reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 50.\n- At turn 50, position is (0, 9), and an action (S) is chosen to stay, as no further vertical movement is needed.\n\nThus, \\(H = 9\\) actions are required, reaching (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 42 + 9 - 1 = 50\\).\n\n### Collision Avoidance\nThe path is verified to avoid collisions:\n- Turn 42: \\(y = 1\\), safe (freeway 1 always safe).\n- Turn 43: \\(y = 2\\), safe (unsafe only at turn 46).\n- Turn 44: \\(y = 3\\), safe (unsafe only at turn 46).\n- Turn 45: \\(y = 4\\), safe (unsafe only at turn 42).\n- Turn 46: \\(y = 5\\), safe (freeway 5 unsafe only at turn 42).\n- Turn 47: \\(y = 6\\), safe (unsafe at turns 48 and 49, not 47).\n- Turn 48: \\(y = 7\\), safe (unsafe only at turn 42).\n- Turn 49: \\(y = 8\\), safe (unsafe at turns 56-59, not 49).\n- Turn 50: \\(y = 9\\), safe (no freeway).\n\nNo alternative path achieves \\(y = 9\\) in fewer than 9 actions (e.g., moving down or staying increases \\(H\\)).\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}\\) for \\(t = t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 42\\) to 50 is:\n- Turn 42: U (move up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 43)\n- Turn 43: U (move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 44)\n- Turn 44: U (move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 45)\n- Turn 45: U (move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 46)\n- Turn 46: U (move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 47)\n- Turn 47: U (move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 48)\n- Turn 48: U (move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 49)\n- Turn 49: U (move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 50)\n- Turn 50: S (stay at \\(y = 9\\))\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 42: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 43: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 44: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 45: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 46: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 47: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 48: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 50: \\, S \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. Cars move horizontally on their freeways, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway y at turn T and a car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that at turn T, when I decide to move to y_{T+1}, I'm not on y_{T+1} until the next turn, so I only care about the car on my current y at the current turn. Specifically, collision occurs only if for the freeway I'm on at turn T, there is a car with 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nNow, the current turn is t_1 = 43, and I'm at y=2. I need to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, I need to understand where the cars are at each turn relative to t_1. The car positions are given at t_1, and they move with constant speed.\n\nLet me denote the time from t_1 as t, so at time t=0 (turn t_1), I'm at y=2.\n\nThen for any future turn T = t_1 + t, the car positions are shifted.\n\nFor a car, at turn T, span is [head - s*(T - t_1), tail - s*(T - t_1)] for left-moving, or [tail + s*(T - t_1), head + s*(T - t_1)] for right-moving? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\n\nBut [h, τ] with h and τ, I think h is head, τ is tail. For left-moving, if it's moving left, head should be on the left, I think.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], which might imply τ is left, h is right, since it's moving right.\n\nI need to interpret the coordinates.\n\nThe grid is such that x=0 is the point we care about for collision. Cars are on horizontal freeways, and we're moving vertically at x=0.\n\nCollision when 0 is in the car's span at that turn for the freeway we're on.\n\nFor a car, the span is a interval on the x-axis.\n\nAt turn t_1, for each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: left or right.\n\nFor left-moving, head is the front when moving left, so if moving left, head should be greater than tail if x decreases left, I assume.\n\nTypically, x-axis, left is decreasing x, right is increasing x.\n\nSo for left-moving car, it's moving to decreasing x, so head has higher x than tail? Let's see the notation.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and then Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\n\nIf it's moving left, and [h, τ] at t_1, with h and τ, but if it's moving left, and we subtract s*(T-t_1), so the span shifts left, so at t_1, h should be the right end, τ the left end? But it says [h, τ], which might be in order.\n\nFor example, take freeway 1: (96,49, right, 48) — direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [49,96] I think? It says (head, tail) but in the list it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), but for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], so h is head, τ is tail.\n\nIn the notation, for a car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor direction:\n\n- If right-moving: head is the front when moving right, so head > tail, and Span(t_1) = [tail, head] because it says [τ, h] with τ tail, h head.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s dt, h + s dt]\n\nSince moving right, τ and h increase.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - s dt, τ - s dt], moving left, h and τ decrease.\n\nIn [h, τ], for left-moving, h is the head, which is left or right? If moving left, head should be on the left, so if x decreases left, head has smaller x? I'm getting confused.\n\nAssume the x-axis: smaller x is left, larger x is right.\n\nSo moving left means decreasing x.\n\nFor a left-moving car, at position, head has smaller x than tail? No.\n\nTypically, for a car, head is the front. If moving left, front is towards left, so head has smaller x, tail has larger x.\n\nFor example, car facing left: head left, tail right.\n\nSo span [head, tail] with head < tail if x increasing right.\n\nBut in the notation, for left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and then [h - s dt, τ - s dt].\n\nIf h is head and left, τ tail right, then h < τ, and [h, τ] with h small, τ large, and when subtract s dt, both decrease, so it moves left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], and for right-moving, head should be right, tail left, so τ tail left, h head right, so τ < h, and [τ, h] with τ small, h large, and when add s dt, both increase, moves right.\n\nIn the car list, for example, freeway 1: (96,49, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so head=96, tail=49, so since right-moving, head=96 > tail=49, so at t_1, span [τ, h] = [49,96]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: two cars, (-36,-47, right,12) and (36,25, right,12)\n\nFor first, head=-36, tail=-47? head=-36, tail=-47, but -36 > -47, so tail=-47, head=-36, so span [τ, h] = [-47,-36]? τ is tail, h is head.\n\nτ = tail = -47, h = head = -36, so [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nSimilarly, second car (36,25, right,12), head=36, tail=25, [25,36]\n\nBut on the same freeway, multiple cars, but they might overlap or not, but for collision, we care if 0 is in any car's span at that turn for the freeway.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 3 same as 2? It says freeway 2 has two cars, freeway 3 has same: (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12), so identical cars on different freeways I think, but different y.\n\nFreeway k is y=k.\n\nNow, back to the problem.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=2 to y=9, min turns, avoiding when on a freeway y at turn T, if 0 in some car span on y at T.\n\nAt turn T, when I am at position y_T, I am on freeway y_T, and I check if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nIf I move to a new y, I am not on it until the next turn.\n\nNow, I start at t=0 (turn t_1=43), y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince I can only change y by -1,0,+1 per turn, min steps to go from 2 to 9 is 7 steps, all U, but I have to avoid cars, so I might need to stay or go down sometimes, or take more turns.\n\nH is the number of turns including the actions, so from t=0 to t=H-1, I do H actions, and at turn t=H-1, I reach y=9.\n\nLet's define time t relative to t_1.\n\nAt turn t_1 + t for t=0,1,2,... \n\nAt t=0, y=2.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nI need y_T = 9 for some T, min T? Min H such that after H actions, I am at y=9 at turn t_1 + H.\n\nLet's see: at turn t_1 + t, y_{t_1 + t} is the position.\n\nAfter action at turn t_1 + t, I move to y_{t_1 + t+1}.\n\nThe turn when I am at position is when we check collision.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1 + t, I am at y_{t_1 + t}, and I take action a_{t_1 + t}, then at turn t_1 + t+1, I am at new position.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn based on current position.\n\nTo reach (0,9), at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nAnd for all turns from t_1 to T-1, when I am on y, no car on that y has 0 in span at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, when I am at y=9, I don't care about collision on y=9? The freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think.\n\nThe problem says: freeways y=1,...,8, and collision only on these freeways.\n\nAlso, y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nLet me check.\n\n\"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, \\dots, 8\"\n\nAnd player position (0,y), with y from 0 to 9.\n\nAt y=0 or y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible.\n\nAlso, when moving, if I go to y=0 or y=9, I am safe there.\n\nIn particular, to reach (0,9), once I am at y=9, I am done.\n\nNow, I start at y=2, which is a freeway, so I need to check cars at t=0 on y=2.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per freeway at t=0 (turn t_1=43).\n\nFreeway y=1: one car: (96,49, right,48) so right-moving, head=96, tail=49, so span at t_1: [τ, h] = [49,96]\n\nSpeed s=48.\n\nFreeway y=2: two cars: (-36,-47, right,12) and (36,25, right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=-36, tail=-47, so [τ,h] = [-47,-36]\n\nSecond car: head=36, tail=25, so [25,36]\n\nFreeway y=3: same as y=2: cars (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12), so [ -47,-36] and [25,36]\n\nFreeway y=4: one car: (-60,-25, left,36)\n\nLeft-moving, so for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [-60, -25]? head h=-60, tail τ=-25, and since left-moving, head should be left, so h=-60 < τ=-25, so span [h,τ] = [-60,-25]\n\nThen at T, [h - s dt, τ - s dt]\n\nSimilarly, freeway y=5: same as y=4: (-60,-25, left,36), so [ -60,-25]\n\nFreeway y=6: one car: (-30,-41, right,6)\n\nRight-moving, head=-30, tail=-41, so [τ,h] = [-41,-30]\n\nFreeway y=7: two cars: (60,49, right,4) and (12,1, right,4)\n\nFirst: head=60, tail=49, so [49,60]\n\nSecond: head=12, tail=1, so [1,12]\n\nFreeway y=8: one car: (-39,-50, right,3)\n\nHead=-39, tail=-50, so [τ,h] = [-50,-39]\n\nNow, I need for each freeway and each time, whether 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that time.\n\nLet dt = T - t_1, so at time t (relative), dt = t.\n\nAt turn t_1 + t, for freeway k, if there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nSince multiple cars, if any car has 0 in span, then occupied, collision if on that freeway.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I can find when 0 is occupied.\n\nFirst, freeway y=1: one car, right-moving, span at t_1: [49,96], speed 48, so at time t, span [49 + 48t, 96 + 48t] since right-moving, [τ + s t, h + s t]\n\n0 in span if 49 + 48t <= 0 <= 96 + 48t\n\nSince 49 to 96, both positive, and increasing, 0 is less than 49, so 0 < 49 +48t for all t>=0, so never <=0, so 0 not in span for any t. Similarly, min is 49>0, so never covered 0. So y=1 is always safe? At t=0, [49,96], 0 not in, and as time increases, it moves right, so always x>48>0, so 0 never in span. So freeway 1 is always safe to be on.\n\nIs that right? [49 +48t, 96+48t], at t=0, [49,96], 0 not in; t=1, [97,144], etc., always positive and increasing, so yes, 0 never in [49+48t,96+48t] for t>=0. So y=1 is always free at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway y=2: cars at t=0: first car [-47,-36], second [25,36]\n\nFirst car: right-moving, span [ -47 +12t, -36 +12t]\n\n0 in span if -47 +12t <= 0 <= -36 +12t\n\nBut -36 +12t <=0? Let's solve inequalities.\n\n-47 +12t <= 0 <= -36 +12t\n\nFrom 0 <= -36 +12t, so 12t >=36, t>=3\n\nFrom -47 +12t <=0, 12t <=47, t<=47/12≈3.916, so t<=3 since t integer? t is turn, integer.\n\nt integer, so t>=3 and t<=3, because t=3: 0 <= -36 +12*3 = -36+36=0, so 0<=0, which is true, equal.\n\nAnd -47 +12*3 = -47+36= -11 <=0, true.\n\nAt t=4: 0 <= -36 +48=12, true, but -47+48=1 <=0? 1<=0 false.\n\n0 in span if -47+12t <=0 and 0<= -36+12t? No.\n\n0 in [L,R] if L <=0 and 0<=R? [L,R] is the interval, so L <= x <= R for x in span.\n\nSo for first car, L = -47+12t, R= -36+12t\n\n0 in span if L <=0 <= R, i.e., -47+12t <=0 and 0 <= -36+12t\n\nWhich is 12t <=47 and 12t >=36\n\nSo t <= 47/12 = 3.916, t <=3 since t integer? t integer.\n\nt >= ceil(36/12) = ceil(3) =3\n\nt <= floor(47/12) = floor(3.916)=3\n\nBecause at t=3: L= -47+36= -11 <=0, R= -36+36=0, so 0<=0, true.\n\nAt t=4: L= -47+48=1 >0, so L=1>0, not <=0, so 0 not <= R? L=1, R=12, 0 not >=L=1, so 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSimilarly, t=2: L= -47+24= -23, R= -36+24= -12, both negative, 0 > R= -12, so not in.\n\nSo only at t=3, 0 in first car span? But we have second car.\n\nSecond car on y=2: [25,36] at t=0, right-moving, span [25+12t, 36+12t]\n\n0 in [25+12t,36+12t]? 25+12t >0 for t>=0, so 0 < L, not in, so never.\n\nSo for freeway y=2, only at t=3 (relative time), the first car has 0 in span, so occupied at t=3.\n\nAt other times, not occupied, since second car never covers 0.\n\nt=3 only.\n\nNow freeway y=3: same as y=2, cars identical, so also occupied only at t=3.\n\nNow freeway y=4: one car, left-moving, (-60,-25, left,36)\n\nLeft-moving, span at t_1: [h, τ] = [-60, -25]? head h=-60, tail τ=-25, and [h,τ] = [-60,-25]\n\nThen at time t, [h - s t, τ - s t] = [-60 -36t, -25 -36t]\n\n0 in span if -60-36t <= 0 <= -25-36t\n\nNow, 0 <= -25-36t? -25-36t <= -25 <0 for t>=0, so 0 <= negative number? False, so never true.\n\nSimilarly, left part -60-36t <=0 always true since negative, but 0 <= R not true, so 0 not in span for any t. So y=4 always safe.\n\nSimilarly y=5 same, always safe.\n\nNow freeway y=6: car (-30,-41, right,6)\n\nRight-moving, head=-30, tail=-41, so [τ,h] = [-41,-30]\n\nSpan at t: [-41 +6t, -30 +6t]\n\n0 in span if -41+6t <=0 <= -30+6t\n\nSo -41+6t <=0 and 0<= -30+6t\n\nFrom 0<= -30+6t, 6t>=30, t>=5\n\nFrom -41+6t <=0, 6t<=41, t<=41/6≈6.833, t<=6\n\nSo t=5,6\n\nAt t=5: L= -41+30= -11 <=0, R= -30+30=0, 0<=0 true\n\nt=6: L= -41+36= -5 <=0, R= -30+36=6, 0<=6 true\n\nt=7: L= -41+42=1>0, not <=0, so 0 not in [1,12]? R= -30+42=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo occupied at t=5 and t=6.\n\nNow freeway y=7: two cars: (60,49,right,4) and (12,1,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head=60, tail=49, [τ,h]=[49,60], span [49+4t,60+4t], min 49>0, never cover 0.\n\nSecond car: head=12, tail=1, [1,12], span [1+4t,12+4t], min 1>0, never cover 0.\n\nSo both cars always away from 0, so y=7 always safe.\n\nNow freeway y=8: car (-39,-50,right,3)\n\nHead=-39, tail=-50, [τ,h]=[-50,-39], span [-50+3t, -39+3t]\n\n0 in span if -50+3t <=0 <= -39+3t\n\nSo -50+3t <=0 and 0<= -39+3t\n\n0<= -39+3t => 3t>=39, t>=13\n\n-50+3t <=0 => 3t<=50, t<=50/3≈16.666, t<=16\n\nSo t from 13 to 16 inclusive.\n\nt=13: L= -50+39= -11 <=0, R= -39+39=0, 0<=0 true\n\nt=14: L= -50+42= -8 <=0, R= -39+42=3, 0<=3 true\n\nt=15: L= -50+45= -5 <=0, R= -39+45=6, 0<=6 true\n\nt=16: L= -50+48= -2 <=0, R= -39+48=9, 0<=9 true\n\nt=17: L= -50+51=1>0, not <=0, so not in.\n\nSo occupied at t=13,14,15,16.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, times when occupied (0 in span):\n\ny=1: never\n\ny=2: t=3 only\n\ny=3: t=3 only\n\ny=4: never\n\ny=5: never\n\ny=6: t=5 and t=6\n\ny=7: never\n\ny=8: t=13 to 16\n\nAlso, y=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nI start at t=0, y=2.\n\nAt t=0, y=2, is it occupied? At t=0, y=2 occupied? We have for y=2, at t=0, not occupied, only at t=3.\n\nt=0: free, as above.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nMin steps: from y=2 to y=9, need +7, so min 7 moves up.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on occupied freeways at wrong times.\n\nSince I can stay or move down, I might need to wait.\n\nThe occupied times: y=2 and y=3 are only bad at t=3.\n\ny=6 bad at t=5,6.\n\ny=8 bad at t=13-16, which is later, might not be issue if I go fast.\n\nBut y=6 at t=5,6 is problematic if I am there.\n\nt=0: I am at y=2, safe.\n\nI want to move up.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf I go up to y=3 at t=1.\n\nLet me denote the state at each turn.\n\nAt turn t (relative to t_1), position y_t.\n\nAfter action, y_{t+1}.\n\nt starts from 0.\n\nAt t=0: y=2, and since not occupied, I can be here.\n\nNow, I take action a_0.\n\nI need to choose actions to reach y=9 asap.\n\nSince min steps 7, I should try to go up directly if possible.\n\nBut obstacles at certain times.\n\nFirst, y=2 is occupied only at t=3, so I need to not be on y=2 at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at t=3 occupied.\n\ny=6 at t=5 and 6 occupied.\n\ny=8 at t=13-16, but if I go fast, I might not reach t=13.\n\nt is time from start, so if I move slowly, t larger.\n\nBut I want min H, so min time.\n\nLet me plan the path.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some T.\n\nTo min T, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on bad positions at bad times.\n\nList the dangerous points:\n\n- At t=3, y=2 and y=3 are occupied, so I cannot be on y=2 or y=3 at t=3.\n\n- At t=5 and t=6, y=6 occupied, cannot be on y=6 at t=5 or t=6.\n\n- At t=13-16, y=8 occupied, but t=13 is late, if I go up in 7 steps, I reach at t=7 (since start t=0, after 7 actions, at turn t=7, y=9).\n\nt=0: after 0 actions, y=2\n\nAfter first action at t=0, to t=1, y changes.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn t_1 + t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t at turn t_1 + t, y_{t+1} for turn t_1 + t+1.\n\nSo at time t, position y_t.\n\ny_t for t=0,1,2,...\n\nI need y_T =9 for some T, min T.\n\nT is the turn when I reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9, min T=7, if I go up each time, y_t = 2 + t for t=0 to 7, but at t=7, y=9.\n\nBut need to check for each t, when on freeway, not occupied.\n\ny_t from t=0 to 6 on freeways 2 to 8, but y=9 not freeway.\n\nAt t=0, y=2: freeway y=2, not occupied except t=3, t=0 ok.\n\nt=1, if y=3, freeway y=3, occupied only at t=3, t=1 not t=3, ok.\n\nBut at t=3, if y=3 or y=2, occupied.\n\nIn direct path: suppose all U actions.\n\nStart t=0, y=2\n\na0=U, t=1, y=3\n\na1=U, t=2, y=4\n\na2=U, t=3, y=5\n\na3=U, t=4, y=6\n\na4=U, t=5, y=7\n\na5=U, t=6, y=8\n\na6=U, t=7, y=9\n\nNow, check each turn:\n\nt=0: y=2, freeway y=2, occupied only at t=3, so t=0 ok.\n\nt=1: y=3, freeway y=3, occupied only at t=3, t=1 not t=3, ok.\n\nt=2: y=4, freeway y=4, always safe, ok.\n\nt=3: y=5, freeway y=5, always safe, ok.\n\nt=4: y=6, freeway y=6, occupied at t=5 and t=6, not t=4, so ok.\n\nt=5: y=7, freeway y=7, always safe, ok.\n\nt=6: y=8, freeway y=8, occupied at t=13-16, t=6 <13, so not occupied, ok? y=8 occupied only from t=13 to 16, at t=6, not occupied, since t=6, span [-50+3*6, -39+3*6] = [-50+18, -39+18] = [-32,-21], both negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen t=7: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nIn this path, all positions are safe at the times I am there.\n\nt=3: y=5, safe.\n\nt=4: y=6, at t=4, is it occupied? y=6 occupied at t=5 and 6, not t=4.\n\nAt t=4, y=6: freeway y=6, car span [-41 +6*4, -30 +6*4] = [-41+24, -30+24] = [-17,-6], both negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=5: y=7, safe.\n\nt=6: y=8, at t=6, span [-50+18, -39+18] = [-32,-21], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=7: y=9, done.\n\nAnd I reached in 7 turns.\n\nBut at t=3, I am at y=5, not y=2 or 3, so fine.\n\nIs there any problem? y=6 at t=4 is safe, only bad at t=5,6.\n\nIn this path, I am at y=6 at t=4, which is before t=5, safe.\n\nAnd at t=5, I am at y=7, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly, t=6 at y=8, safe.\n\nSo this seems to work with H=7 actions, from t=0 to t=6, reaching at turn t=7.\n\nH is the number of actions, I think.\n\nThe sequence: actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y=9.\n\nIn this case, at turn t_1 + t for t=0 to 6, positions y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n\nAt turn t_1 +7, y=9.\n\nActions: at turn t_1 + t for t=0 to 6: all U.\n\nBut for collision, at each turn, we check when on freeway.\n\nIn this case, all good.\n\nBut let me confirm the times.\n\nt_relative: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6\n\ny: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n\nfreeways: y=2 at t=0: ok\n\ny=3 at t=1: ok\n\ny=4 at t=2: ok\n\ny=5 at t=3: ok\n\ny=6 at t=4: span at t=4 for y=6: [-41+24, -30+24]=[-17,-6], 0 not in, ok\n\ny=7 at t=5: ok\n\ny=8 at t=6: span [-50+18, -39+18]=[-32,-21], 0 not in, ok\n\nThen turn t=7, y=9, done.\n\nNo collision.\n\nAnd H=7.\n\nBut is there a reason to take more turns? Min is 7, and it works.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=6 at t=5,6 bad, but in this path, I am not on y=6 at t=5 or t=6.\n\nAt t=4, y=6, safe; t=5, y=7, safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut what about the cars on other freeways? But we only care when on that freeway.\n\nAlso, y=1,4,5,7 always safe, which we used.\n\ny=3 at t=3 bad, but we not there at t=3.\n\nIn this path, at t=3, we at y=5.\n\nt=3 relative.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=43.\n\nSo actions from turn 43 to 43+6=49.\n\nTurn 43: action U\n\nTurn 44: U (since t=1)\n\nt relative: t=0: turn 43, action a43\n\nAfter action, turn 44, position y=3\n\nIn the sequence, it says: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nSo for turn 43: a_{43} = U\n\nThen turn 44: a_{44} = U\n\n...\n\nup to turn 49: a_{49} = U, and at turn 50, y=9.\n\nH=7 actions.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point I might be on a freeway when occupied.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1 +3 =46, y=5, freeway y=5, always safe.\n\nt_1 +4=47, y=6, freeway y=6, at time t=4 relative, dt=4, span [-41+24, -30+24]=[-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, t_1 +5=48, y=7, safe.\n\nt_1 +6=49, y=8, safe.\n\nt_1 +7=50, y=9.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is there a car on y=6 at t=5? But I not there.\n\nPerhaps I should check if I can go faster, but 7 is min.\n\nMaybe I can go slower, but no need.\n\nIn the car list, freeway 2 and 3 have cars at same positions, but different y.\n\nIn this path, I only go through y=2 to 8, but y=2 at t=0, y=3 at t=1, both safe at those times.\n\ny=4,5 safe.\n\ny=6 at t=4 safe.\n\ny=7 safe.\n\ny=8 at t=6 safe.\n\nNo problem.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nI think it should be fine.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,2) at turn t_1=43.\n\nAfter actions, reach (0,9) at turn 50.\n\nH=7 turns? H is number of actions.\n\nThe sequence is for turns t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nIn this case, H=7, actions at turn 43 to 49.\n\nOutput:\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nBut at turn 49, action U, to y=9 at turn 50.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be actions.\n\nBut let me make sure about the collision when moving.\n\nThe note says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so not collided by cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nIn this case, when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I take action to go to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I am on y_T, so I check cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nIn the direct path, no issue.\n\nFor example, at turn 47 (t=4 relative), y=6, I take U to go to y=7 at turn 48.\n\nAt turn 47, I am on y=6, cars on y=6 at turn 47 (t=4) safe.\n\nThen at turn 48, I am on y=7, cars on y=7 at turn 48 (t=5) safe.\n\nSimilarly all.\n\nNo problem.\n\nBut is there a reason why this might not work? I think it should.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car on y=6.\n\ny=6: car at t=0: [-41,-30], span at t: [-41+6t, -30+6t]\n\nAt t=4: [-41+24, -30+24] = [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nAt t=5: [-41+30, -30+30] = [-11,0], 0 in, since 0<=0.\n\nAt t=6: [-41+36, -30+36] = [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nBut in path, at t=4 (turn 47), on y=6, safe.\n\nAt t=5 (turn 48), on y=7, not y=6.\n\nSo fine.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nTherefore, min H=7 with all U.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 2 and 3, they are occupied at t=3, but we not there.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to output something else.\n\nMaybe at y=9, but no issue.\n\nAnother thing: the player can stay or go down, but here not needed.\n\nPerhaps to avoid, but in this case no need.\n\nBut let me see if there is a conflict at some point.\n\nSuppose at t=3, if I were on y=3, it would be bad, but I am on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, at t=5, if on y=6, bad, but I on y=7.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 7 turns.\n\nBut let me confirm the turns.\n\nCurrent turn: t_1 = 43\n\nAt turn 43: position (0,2), take action U, so to y=3 at turn 44.\n\nTurn 44: at y=3, take U, to y=4 at turn 45.\n\nTurn 45: at y=4, take U, to y=5 at turn 46.\n\nTurn 46: at y=5, take U, to y=6 at turn 47.\n\nTurn 47: at y=6, take U, to y=7 at turn 48.\n\nTurn 48: at y=7, take U, to y=8 at turn 49.\n\nTurn 49: at y=8, take U, to y=9 at turn 50.\n\nNow, at each turn, when on freeway:\n\nTurn 43 (t=0): y=2, freeway 2, not occupied\n\nTurn 44 (t=1): y=3, freeway 3, not occupied (only at t=3)\n\nTurn 45 (t=2): y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\nTurn 46 (t=3): y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\nTurn 47 (t=4): y=6, freeway 6, not occupied (occupied at t=5,6)\n\nTurn 48 (t=5): y=7, freeway 7, safe\n\nTurn 49 (t=6): y=8, freeway 8, not occupied (occupied from t=13)\n\nAll safe.\n\nSo H=7, sequence all U.\n\nBut the answer should be in a box.\n\nBut perhaps I should write it.\n\nBut is there any mistake?\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 7, for example, but we don't care since not on it when bad, but in this case, freeway 7 always safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps the multiple cars, but on y=2, at t=3 occupied, but we not there.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo minimal number is 7.\n\nBut let me see if I can do in less? From 2 to 9, difference 7, each action changes y by at most 1, so min 7 actions, so yes.\n\nAnd it works.\n\nTherefore, no need for other actions.\n\nSo the sequence is all U for 7 turns.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\n}\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1, which is 43 to 49.\n\nAnd after that, at turn 50, position (0,9).\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I need to specify H, but in the box, it's the sequence.\n\nThe problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nBut in answer, it says to put the sequence in the box with turns.\n\nAnd H is 7.\n\nBut in the box, only the actions per turn.\n\nNow, I think that's it.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if at turn 47, y=6, is there any car? Freeway 6 has car, but at t=4, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps the car on freeway 8 at t=6, but not occupied.\n\nSo I think correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 43\\) is 7. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) for all 7 turns, as this direct path avoids all collisions with cars on the freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at the relevant times.\n\n### Verification of Path and Collision Avoidance:\n- **Initial state at turn 43 (\\(t = 0\\) relative):** Position \\(y = 2\\).

Freeway \\(y = 5\\) is always safe, so safe.\n- **Turn 47 (\\(t = 4\\)):** Position \\(y = 6\\). Freeway \\(y = 6\\) is not occupied at \\(t = 4\\) (occupied at \\(t = 5\\) and \\(t = 6\\)), so safe. Car span at \\(t = 4\\): \\([-41 + 6 \\times 4, -30 + 6 \\times 4] = [-17, -6]\\), 0 not in span.\n- **Turn 48 (\\(t = 5\\)):** Position \\(y = 7\\). Freeway \\(y = 7\\) is always safe, so safe.\n- **Turn 49 (\\(t = 6\\)):** Position \\(y = 8\\). Freeway \\(y = 8\\) is not occupied at \\(t = 6\\) (occupied from \\(t = 13\\) to \\(t = 16\\)), so safe. Car span at \\(t = 6\\): \\([-50 + 3 \\times 6, -39 + 3 \\times 6] = [-32, -21]\\), 0 not in span.\n- **Turn 50 (\\(t = 7\\)):** Position \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway and thus safe. Goal reached.\n\nAll actions are \"U\" (up), and the path reaches \\(y = 9\\) in the minimum of 7 turns without any collisions.\n\n### Output Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 = 43\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 49\\) is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 43: U \\\\\nTurn 44: U \\\\\nTurn 45: U \\\\\nTurn 46: U \\\\\nTurn 47: U \\\\\nTurn 48: U \\\\\nTurn 49: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The current turn is t_1 = 44. I have to output a sequence of actions starting from turn 44.\n\nThe player moves vertically: U for up (y increases by 1), D for down (y decreases by 1), or S for stay (y stays the same). y must be between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCollision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where there's a car such that 0 is in the car's span at that turn. The car spans move left or right based on their direction and speed.\n\nImportantly, when you move to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn. So at turn T, if you move, you're still on the current row for collision purposes, and you arrive on the new row at turn T+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is the top row, and since there are no cars above y=8, once I'm on y=9, I should be safe.\n\ny=9 is the destination, and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, but y=9 is the target, so I need to be on y=9 at some turn.\n\nNow, let's list the car states for each freeway at turn t_1=44. I need to find out where the cars are at future turns to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, for each car, I have its position at t=44, and I can compute its span at any future turn T.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For left-moving cars, head is the right end, I think? Let me read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] and at T, it's [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ] and then moves left, so h decreases.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h]? It says: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\" for right-moving.\n\nLet's parse the car states.\n\nFor freeway k=1: one car: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nDirection is right, so for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h]? In the update, it says for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nBut in the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). I need to interpret what head and tail mean.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for the update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the right-moving case, Span(t_1) is given as [τ, h], which might be confusing because τ is tail, h is head.\n\nI think head is always the front of the car, tail is the back, regardless of direction.\n\nFor left-moving, head is the right end (since it's moving left), tail is left end? No.\n\nLet's think.\n\nIf a car is moving left, its front is decreasing in x, so at position, head is larger x, tail is smaller x.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, head is smaller x? I'm getting confused.\n\nStandard way: head is the leading end, tail is trailing end.\n\nFor left-moving car, head is left end? No.\n\nIf a car is moving left, its front is going left, so head has smaller x values as it moves.\n\nBut in terms of span, the span covers from min x to max x.\n\nIn the update rule:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] and h > τ probably, since it's [h, τ] and moving left, h decreases, τ decreases.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] and τ < h, moving right, both increase.\n\nIn the freeway table, for k=1: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-95, -48]? τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the notation, it's (head h, tail τ, ...)\n\nSo for k=1: head = -48, tail = -95, direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-95, -48]? But -95 < -48, so [ -95, -48 ] which is from left to right.\n\nThen at time T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-95 + 48*(T-44), -48 + 48*(T-44)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving.\n\nIn general, the span is a interval [min, max] at any time.\n\nCollision if player is at (0,y) at turn T, and for that y, there is a car with 0 in its span at T.\n\nPlayer position at turn T is y_T, and we care about freeway y_T.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I have multiple cars, but I need to know when 0 is covered by any car on that freeway at each turn.\n\nSince the player moves, I need to ensure that when I am on a freeway at turn T, no car has 0 in span at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, I start at turn 44 on y=3.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to move up 6 steps, but I can move down or stay, so it might take more turns if I wait, but I want minimal turns, so probably I should move up as much as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nMinimal H means I should try to go up directly if possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway y=1 to 8, for each turn T, whether position x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nThat is, for each y and T, if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in [min, max] of its span at T.\n\nThen for the player path, when I am at y_t at turn t, it must be that for that y_t and t, it is not occupied.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 have no freeways, so no cars, they are always safe. But y=0 is the bottom, I'm at y=3, going to y=9, so I don't want to go to y=0, but I can if I have to, but it might waste turns.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 is safe.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway at t=44.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head=-48, tail=-95, dir=right, speed=48\n\nSince dir=right, span at t=44: [τ, h] = [-95, -48]\n\nAt time T, span = [-95 + 48*(T-44), -48 + 48*(T-44)]\n\n0 is in span if -95 + 48*(T-44) <= 0 <= -48 + 48*(T-44)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars: (-24, -35, right, 12) and (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head=-24, tail=-35, dir=right, speed=12\n\nSpan at t=44: [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nAt T: [-35 + 12*(T-44), -24 + 12*(T-44)]\n\nSecond car: head=48, tail=37, dir=right, speed=12? Tail=37, head=48, so [τ, h] = [37,48] at t=44\n\nAt T: [37 + 12*(T-44), 48 + 12*(T-44)]\n\nBut for freeway 2, we care about both cars.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? It says (-24, -35, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12) same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nDir=left, so for left-moving, span at t=44: [h, τ] = [48,83]? Head=48, tail=83? But if moving left, head should be the front, which is left end? Confusion.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and it moves left, so h decreases.\n\nIn this case, head=48, tail=83, but 48 < 83, so [h, τ] = [48,83], which is from 48 to 83, and moving left, so at T, [48 - 36*(T-44), 83 - 36*(T-44)]\n\nSince moving left, the head (front) is decreasing.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as freeway 4? (48,83, left,36)\n\nFreeway 6: (-24, -35, right,6)\n\nHead=-24, tail=-35, dir=right, speed=6\n\nSpan at t=44: [τ, h] = [-35,-24]\n\nAt T: [-35 +6*(T-44), -24 +6*(T-44)]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-48,-59, right,4) and (16,5, right,4)\n\nFirst car: head=-48, tail=-59, dir=right, speed=4\n\nSpan: [τ, h] = [-59,-48] at t=44\n\nAt T: [-59 +4*(T-44), -48 +4*(T-44)]\n\nSecond car: head=16, tail=5, dir=right, speed=4\n\nTail=5, head=16, so [τ, h] = [5,16] at t=44\n\nAt T: [5 +4*(T-44), 16 +4*(T-44)]\n\nFreeway 8: (-36,-47, right,3)\n\nHead=-36, tail=-47, dir=right, speed=3\n\nSpan: [τ, h] = [-47,-36] at t=44\n\nAt T: [-47 +3*(T-44), -36 +3*(T-44)]\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find for which turns T, x=0 is occupied, i.e., 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway.\n\nSince the player is at (0,y), we care about the freeway at y when the player is there.\n\nAlso, since the cars move continuously, but we only care at integer turns.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nStart with freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1: span at T: [ -95 + 48ΔT, -48 + 48ΔT ] where ΔT = T-44\n\n0 in span if -95 + 48ΔT <= 0 <= -48 + 48ΔT\n\nLeft: -95 + 48ΔT <= 0 => 48ΔT <= 95 => ΔT <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so ΔT <= 1 since integer? ΔT is integer turn count.\n\nT and ΔT are integers, since turns are discrete.\n\nSo ΔT = T - t_1 = T - 44\n\nInequality: -95 + 48ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 48ΔT\n\nFirst: -95 + 48ΔT <= 0 => 48ΔT <= 95 => ΔT <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so ΔT <= 1\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 48ΔT => 48ΔT >= 48 => ΔT >= 1\n\nSo ΔT >=1 and ΔT <=1, so ΔT=1\n\nThus at T=44 +1 =45, 0 is in span for freeway 1.\n\nFor other ΔT, not satisfied. So only at T=45, freeway 1 is occupied at x=0.\n\nNow freeway 2.\n\nFirst car: span [ -35 +12ΔT, -24 +12ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -35 +12ΔT <= 0 <= -24 +12ΔT\n\nLeft: -35 +12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/12 ≈2.916, so ΔT <=2\n\nRight: 0 <= -24 +12ΔT => 12ΔT >=24 => ΔT >=2\n\nSo ΔT >=2 and ΔT <=2, thus ΔT=2, T=46\n\nSecond car on freeway 2: span [37 +12ΔT, 48 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 37 +12ΔT <=0 <=48 +12ΔT\n\nBut 37 +12ΔT <=0? Since ΔT >=0, 37 +12ΔT >=37>0, so left inequality false, so 0 never <= 37 +12ΔT since min is 37>0, so 0 not in span. Similarly, 48+12ΔT >0 always, but the span is [37+12ΔT, 48+12ΔT] which is always positive, so 0 never in it. So only first car matters.\n\nThus for freeway 2, occupied only at T=46.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2, so also occupied only at T=46.\n\nNow freeway 4: (48,83, left,36)\n\nDir left, span at T: [48 -36ΔT, 83 -36ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 48 -36ΔT <=0 <=83 -36ΔT\n\nLeft: 48 -36ΔT <=0 => 48 <=36ΔT => ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so ΔT >=2 since integer? ΔT >=2? 36ΔT >=48, ΔT >= 48/36=4/3=1.333, so since ΔT integer, ΔT >=2\n\nRight: 0 <=83 -36ΔT => 36ΔT <=83 => ΔT <=83/36≈2.305, so ΔT <=2\n\nSo ΔT >=2 and ΔT <=2, thus ΔT=2, T=46\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4, so occupied at T=46.\n\nFreeway 6: (-24,-35,right,6) but head and tail given.\n\nHead=-24, tail=-35, dir right, speed=6\n\nSpan at T: [ -35 +6ΔT, -24 +6ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -35 +6ΔT <=0 <= -24 +6ΔT\n\nLeft: -35 +6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=35 => ΔT <=35/6≈5.833, so ΔT <=5\n\nRight: 0 <= -24 +6ΔT => 6ΔT >=24 => ΔT >=4\n\nSo ΔT >=4 and ΔT <=5, so ΔT=4 or 5, thus T=48 or 49.\n\nΔT=4: T=44+4=48, ΔT=5: T=49\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4) span [ -59 +4ΔT, -48 +4ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -59 +4ΔT <=0 <= -48 +4ΔT\n\nLeft: -59 +4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=59 => ΔT <=59/4=14.75, so ΔT <=14\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 +4ΔT => 4ΔT >=48 => ΔT >=12\n\nSo ΔT >=12 and ΔT <=14, thus T=56,57,58\n\nSecond car: (16,5,right,4) head=16, tail=5, so [τ,h]=[5,16] at t=44\n\nAt T: [5+4ΔT, 16+4ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 5+4ΔT <=0 <=16+4ΔT\n\nBut 5+4ΔT >=5>0, so left inequality false, 0 never <= 5+4ΔT since min 5>0, so never occupied. Thus only first car matters for freeway 7.\n\nSo freeway 7 occupied at T=56,57,58.\n\nNow freeway 8: (-36,-47,right,3) span [ -47 +3ΔT, -36 +3ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -47 +3ΔT <=0 <= -36 +3ΔT\n\nLeft: -47 +3ΔT <=0 => 3ΔT <=47 => ΔT <=47/3≈15.666, so ΔT <=15\n\nRight: 0 <= -36 +3ΔT => 3ΔT >=36 => ΔT >=12\n\nSo ΔT >=12 and ΔT <=15, thus T=56,57,58,59\n\nΔT=12: T=44+12=56\n\nΔT=13:57\n\nΔT=14:58\n\nΔT=15:59\n\nNow, summarize the occupied times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: occupied only at T=45\n\n- y=2: occupied only at T=46\n\n- y=3: occupied only at T=46\n\n- y=4: occupied only at T=46 (since same as freeway 4 and 5? Freeway 4 is y=4, occupied at T=46)\n\nFreeway 4 is y=4, freeway 5 is y=5.\n\nList by y:\n\ny=1: occupied T=45\n\ny=2: occupied T=46\n\ny=3: occupied T=46\n\ny=4: occupied T=46 (from freeway 4)\n\ny=5: occupied T=46 (from freeway 5, same as 4)\n\ny=6: occupied T=48 and T=49\n\ny=7: occupied T=56,57,58\n\ny=8: occupied T=56,57,58,59\n\ny=9: no cars, always safe\n\ny=0: no cars, always safe\n\nPlayer starts at turn 44 on y=3.\n\nAt turn 44, y=3. Is it occupied? At T=44, for y=3, we need to check if occupied at t=44.\n\nFor freeway y=3, at T=44, ΔT=0.\n\nFrom above, for y=3, we have cars: at ΔT=0, span for first car: [ -35 +12*0, -24 +12*0] = [-35,-24], 0 not in it since -35<0<-24? -35 to -24, 0 not between, since both negative.\n\nSecond car: [37,48], 0 not in it. So at T=44, y=3 is not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways at T=44: let's confirm.\n\ny=1: at T=44, ΔT=0, span [ -95, -48], 0 not in.\n\ny=2: [ -35,-24] and [37,48], 0 not in.\n\ny=4: [48 -0, 83-0]=[48,83], 0 not in.\n\netc. All not occupied at T=44 except possibly, but from above, only specific times occupied.\n\nNow, player at turn 44 on y=3, which is safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since I need to go from y=3 to y=9, that's 6 steps up, so minimum 6 turns if I can go up every turn without collision.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on a freeway when it's occupied.\n\nAt each turn, when I am on a y, it must not be occupied at that turn.\n\nAlso, when I move, I arrive at the new y at the next turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn sequence.\n\nStart at turn 44, y=3.\n\nI need to choose actions from turn 44 onwards.\n\nLet me consider the path.\n\nThe dangerous times are when freeways are occupied.\n\nFor example, y=3 is occupied at T=46.\n\nBut at turn 46, if I am on y=3, collision.\n\nSimilarly, other y at other times.\n\nSince I start at y=3 at t=44, and I want to go up.\n\nIf I go up immediately at t=44, to y=4 at t=45.\n\nBut at t=45, I arrive at y=4? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, based on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, position is (0, y_t), and I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on y_T.\n\nFor example, at turn 44, I am at y=3, which is safe as above.\n\nI choose a_{44}, which affects y_{45}.\n\nIf I choose U, then y_{45} = y_{44} +1 =4\n\nIf D, y_{45}=2, etc.\n\nNow, at turn 45, I will be at y_{45}, and if y_{45} between 1 and 8, I need to check if occupied at T=45.\n\nFrom above, at T=45, only y=1 is occupied? y=1 occupied at T=45.\n\ny=2,3,etc not occupied at T=45 except y=1.\n\nAt T=45, y=1 occupied, others not.\n\nSimilarly, T=46, y=2,3,4,5 occupied.\n\nT=48,49 y=6 occupied.\n\nT=56-59 y=7 and y=8 occupied.\n\nNow, back to path.\n\nI start at t=44, y=3, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 asap.\n\nMinimal H: since from y=3 to y=9, 6 steps, so H min is 6, ending at turn 49? Turns from t=44 to t=44+H-1, and y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet t_start = t_1 =44.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t_start + H -1, y=9.\n\nFor example, if I go up every turn:\n\nTurn 44: at y=3, choose U, then y45=4\n\nTurn 45: at y=4, choose U, y46=5\n\nBut at turn 46, if I am at y=5? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 45, I am at y=4 (after moving from t44).\n\nAt t=45, y=4, is it occupied? T=45, from above, only y=1 occupied, so y=4 safe. I choose U, then y46=5.\n\nNow at turn 46, I am at y=5.\n\nBut at T=46, y=5 is occupied! Since freeway 5 occupied at T=46.\n\nSo collision at t=46 on y=5.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf at t=45 I choose S, then y46=4? At t=45, I am at y=4, choose S, then y46=4.\n\nThen at t=46, I am at y=4, and T=46, y=4 occupied, collision.\n\nIf I choose D at t=45, y46=3, then at t=46 on y=3, which is also occupied at T=46.\n\nSo all choices at t=45 lead to collision at t=46 if I stay on these y.\n\nBut I could move to another y.\n\nAt t=44, instead of going up, I could go down or stay.\n\nBut going down might not help to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=3 is safe at t=44, and occupied at t=46, I need to not be on y=3 at t=46.\n\nSimilarly for other y.\n\nThe issue is at t=46, multiple y are occupied.\n\nSpecifically, y=2,3,4,5 all occupied at T=46.\n\ny=1 occupied only at T=45, not 46.\n\ny=6 occupied at T=48,49, not 46.\n\nAt T=46, y=1: not occupied? y=1 occupied only at T=45, not 46.\n\nAt T=46, for y=1: from earlier, only at T=45, so at T=46 not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 not occupied at T=46.\n\ny=7,8 not occupied until later.\n\nSo at T=46, safe y are: y=0,1,6,7,8,9\n\nBut y=0 and y=9 are safe, y=1,6,7,8 not occupied at T=46.\n\ny=1: occupied only T=45, so at T=46, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow back to path.\n\nI need to be on one of the safe y at t=46.\n\nI start at t=44, y=3.\n\nAt t=44, I choose action.\n\nIf I choose U, then y45=4\n\nAt t=45, I am at y=4.\n\nNow at t=45, y=4: is it occupied? T=45, from above, only y=1 occupied, so y=4 safe at t=45.\n\nI need to choose a_{45} such that y46 is safe for t=46.\n\nSafe y for t=46: y=0,1,6,7,8,9\n\nFrom y=4 at t=45, possible actions:\n\n- U: y46=5\n\n- D: y46=3\n\n- S: y46=4\n\nBut y=3,4,5 are all unsafe at t=46, as occupied.\n\nSo I cannot choose U, D, or S, because y46 would be 5,3, or 4, all unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nSo from y=4 at t=45, I cannot reach a safe y for t=46 with one move.\n\ny46 needs to be 0,1,6,7,8,9.\n\nFrom y=4, with one action, I can go to y=3,4,5 (D,S,U), none of which are safe y for t=46.\n\ny=1 is safe but I can't reach from y=4 in one step; min y change is 1.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 is too far.\n\nSo it's impossible to be at y=4 at t=45 if I want to avoid t=46 collision.\n\nTherefore, I should not go to y=4 at t=45.\n\nAt t=44, instead of going up, I could go down or stay.\n\nIf at t=44, I choose D, then y45=2\n\nAt t=45, I am at y=2.\n\ny=2 at t=45: T=45, occupied? Only y=1 occupied at T=45, so y=2 safe.\n\nThen I need to choose a_{45} for y46.\n\ny46 safe: 0,1,6,7,8,9\n\nFrom y=2, possible y46: U to 3, D to 1, S to 2.\n\ny=3,2,1.\n\ny=1 is safe for t=46? y=1 at t=46 not occupied, yes.\n\ny=2 and y=3 unsafe.\n\nSo I can choose D at t=45 to go to y=1 at t=46.\n\ny46=1.\n\nThen at t=46, on y=1, which is safe since not occupied.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=1 is low, so it might take more turns.\n\nIf at t=44, I choose S, then y45=3\n\nAt t=45, on y=3, safe (T=45 not occupied for y=3).\n\nThen choose a_{45}: to reach safe y for t=46.\n\nFrom y=3, possible y46: U to 4, D to 2, S to 3.\n\nAll unsafe for t=46.\n\nNo way to safe y.\n\nSo only possibility is to go down at t=44 to y=2 at t=45, then down to y=1 at t=46.\n\nThen at t=46, on y=1.\n\nNow, from here, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut there are later obstacles, like y=6 occupied at t=48,49, and y=7,8 at later times.\n\nFirst, let's see the sequence so far.\n\nTurn 44: at y=3, choose D, so y45=2\n\nTurn 45: at y=2, choose D, so y46=1\n\nNow at turn 46: at y=1, safe.\n\nI need to go up.\n\nBut y=1 is safe, but I need to avoid other occupied times.\n\nNow, from y=1, I can choose actions.\n\nI want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut y=6 occupied at t=48 and 49.\n\nt=46, y=1.\n\nIf I go up each turn:\n\nTurn 46: choose U, y47=2\n\nTurn 47: choose U, y48=3\n\nBut at turn 48, y=3: is it occupied? T=48.\n\nFrom earlier, for y=3, occupied only at T=46, not at T=48. So should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 occupied at T=48,49.\n\nAt turn 48, if I am on y=3, not y=6, so ok.\n\nThen turn 48: at y=3, choose U, y49=4\n\nTurn 49: at y=4, choose U, y50=5\n\nBut at turn 49, y=4: T=49, occupied? From earlier, y=4 occupied only at T=46, not at 49, so safe.\n\ny=5 similarly.\n\nNow at turn 49, I am at y=4? Let's list:\n\nt=46: y=1\n\nt=46 action: U, so y47=2\n\nt=47: at y=2, action U, y48=3\n\nt=48: at y=3, action U, y49=4\n\nt=49: at y=4, action U, y50=5\n\nt=50: at y=5, action U, y51=6\n\nBut at turn 50, y=5, T=50, not occupied, safe.\n\nBut at turn 51, y=6.\n\nNow T=51, y=6 occupied? From earlier, y=6 occupied at T=48 and 49, not at 50 or 51? T=48 and 49.\n\nAt T=51, not occupied, so safe to be on y=6 at t=51.\n\nThen continue.\n\nt=51: at y=6, action U, y52=7\n\nt=52: at y=7, action U, y53=8\n\nt=53: at y=8, action U, y54=9\n\nNow at t=54, y=9, reached.\n\nBut I need to check if at any point I am on a freeway when occupied.\n\nFor example, at t=52, y=7, T=52.\n\ny=7 occupied at T=56,57,58, not at 52, so safe.\n\nSimilarly t=53, y=8, T=53, occupied at T=56-59, not 53, safe.\n\nt=54, y=9, safe.\n\nBut what about y=6 at t=51, safe as above.\n\nIn this path, I was on y=1 at t=46, which is fine.\n\nBut I started from y=3 at t=44, went down to y=2 at t=45, down to y=1 at t=46.\n\nThen up from there.\n\nTotal turns: from t=44 to t=54, y=9 at t=54.\n\nt=44 to t=54, that's 11 turns? Let's count the actions.\n\nStart at t=44, position y=3.\n\nAfter action at t=44, y45 set.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nt_1=44.\n\nAt turn t, after action, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t.\n\nAt turn 44, y44=3.\n\nAfter action a44, y45 determined.\n\n...\n\nAfter action at turn t, y_{t+1}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if at turn 44, I set y45, then at turn 45, y45, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H -1, the position is y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nSet to 9.\n\nIn the sequence: actions from t=44 to t=53? Let's list the turns and positions.\n\nTurn 44: position y=3, choose a44=D, so y45=2\n\nTurn 45: position y=2, choose a45=D, so y46=1\n\nTurn 46: position y=1, choose a46=U, so y47=2\n\nTurn 47: position y=2, choose a47=U, so y48=3\n\nTurn 48: position y=3, choose a48=U, so y49=4\n\nTurn 49: position y=4, choose a49=U, so y50=5\n\nTurn 50: position y=5, choose a50=U, so y51=6\n\nTurn 51: position y=6, choose a51=U, so y52=7\n\nTurn 52: position y=7, choose a52=U, so y53=8\n\nTurn 53: position y=8, choose a53=U, so y54=9\n\nNow at turn 54, position y=9, which is the target.\n\nSo I reached at turn 54.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=44 to t=53, that's 10 actions? t=44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53: 10 turns.\n\nH=10, and at turn t_1 + H -1 = 44 + 10 -1 =53? t_1 + H -1 =53, but y at turn 53 is 8, not 9.\n\nMistake.\n\nAt turn t, position is y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 53, y53=8.\n\nAfter a53=U, y54=9, but y54 is set at turn 53, but the position at turn 53 is y53=8.\n\nWe need position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nSo for example, if I start at t=44, y44=3.\n\nAfter a44, y45.\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t_1 + H -2}, y_{t_1 + H -1} is set.\n\nSet t = t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 54, y54=9.\n\nSo t_1 + H -1 =54.\n\nt_1=44, so 44 + H -1 =54, thus H-1=10, H=11.\n\nActions from t=44 to t=54? But actions are chosen at each turn from t=44 to t=53 for y to change to 9 at t=54.\n\nThe sequence of actions: for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, but H is the number of actions.\n\nDefine: we need a sequence of H actions: a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H -1}, such that after these actions, at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nIn the path: actions at t=44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53: 10 actions?

But actions are from t=44 to t=53 to set y from 45 to 54.\n\nNumber of actions: to go from y44 to y54, that's 10 steps, but y54 is set by a53.\n\nLet's list the turn and position:\n\nTurn 44: y44=3\n\nAfter a44: y45 set\n\nTurn 45: y45=2 (in our case)\n\nAfter a45: y46 set\n\n...\n\nTurn 53: y53=8\n\nAfter a53: y54 set to 9\n\nBut at turn 53, position is y53=8, not 9.\n\nWe need at turn t, y_t=9 for t= t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo for example, to have y54=9, then t=54, t_1 + H -1=54, H-1=10, H=11.\n\nThen at turn 54, y54=9.\n\nIn the sequence, with 11 actions, I can reach earlier.\n\nBut in the above path, I reached y54=9 with actions from t=44 to t=53, which is 10 actions, but y54=9 at turn 54, so t_1 + H -1=54, with H=10, t_1 + H -1=44+10-1=53, which is turn 53, but y53=8, not 9. Contradiction.\n\nTo have y_t=9 at turn t, it must be that the action at t-1 set it, or if t=t_1, initial.\n\nSince t>t_1, action at t-1 sets y_t.\n\nFor y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, it is set by action at (t_1 + H -1) -1 = t_1 + H -2.\n\nBut the actions are from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, so a_{t_1 + H -1} sets y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which is set by a_{t_1 + H -2}.\n\nSo for example, if H=6, actions at t=44 to 49, set y45 to y50, and y_{44+6-1}=y49 should be 9, so a48 sets y49=9.\n\nSimilarly, in general, with H actions, we set y from t_1+1 to t_1+H, and y_{t_1 + H -1} should be 9.\n\nFor y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, it is the position at turn t_1 + H -1, which is set by action at t_1 + H -2.\n\nThe actions include a_{t_1 + H -1}, which sets y_{t_1 + H}, not relevant for the position at t_1 + H -1.\n\nTo clarify:\n\n- At turn t_1, position y_{t_1} given.\n\n- Choose a_{t_1}, sets y_{t_1 +1}\n\n- Choose a_{t_1 +1}, sets y_{t_1 +2}\n\n- ...\n- Choose a_{t_1 + H -1}, sets y_{t_1 + H}\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + k is y_{t_1 + k} for k=0 to H.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for example, with H actions, we have positions from y_{t_1} to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn the sequence above, with actions from t=44 to t=53 (10 actions), we have y from 44 to 54, and y_{53} =8, y_{54}=9, so y_{t_1 + H -1} with t_1=44, H=10, t_1 + H -1=53, y53=8 ≠9.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1}=9, we need for example y49=9 or something.\n\nIn my earlier path, I reached y54=9 at turn 54, so to have y54=9, then t_1 + H -1=54, so 44 + H -1=54, H-1=10, H=11.\n\nThen with 11 actions, I can reach faster.\n\nBut let's first see if I can reach with fewer turns.\n\nBack to the collision avoidance.\n\nAt t=44, y=3, safe.\n\nI need to not be on y=3,4,5 at t=46, since occupied.\n\nAt t=46, I need to be on y=0,1,6,7,8,9.\n\nFrom t=44, with two actions, I can reach y at t=46.\n\nAt t=44, position y44=3.\n\nAfter a44, y45 set.\n\nAfter a45, y46 set.\n\nSo y46 depends on a44 and a45.\n\nFrom y44=3, possible (a44, a45):\n\n- U,U: y45=4, y46=5\n\n- U,D: y45=4, y46=3\n\n- U,S: y45=4, y46=4\n\n- D,U: y45=2, y46=3\n\n- D,D: y45=2, y46=1\n\n- D,S: y45=2, y46=2\n\n- S,U: y45=3, y46=4\n\n- S,D: y45=3, y46=2\n\n- S,S: y45=3, y46=3\n\nAll of these y46 are 5,3,4,3,1,2,4,2,3, all of which except y46=1 are unsafe for t=46.\n\nOnly y46=1 is safe, which is from a44=D, a45=D.\n\nSo the only way to be safe at t=46 is to be on y=1 at t=46, by going down twice.\n\nThen from there, I go up.\n\nBut as before, it takes many turns.\n\nI could go to y=6 or higher at t=46, but from y=3 at t=44, with two actions, the max I can go is y45=4, y46=5, which is unsafe, or min y46=1.\n\nI can't reach y=6 in two steps from y=3.\n\nSo only choice is to go to y=1 at t=46.\n\nThen from y=1 at t=46, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut there is y=6 occupied at t=48 and t=49.\n\nSo at t=48 and t=49, I need not to be on y=6.\n\nSimilarly, later for y=7 and 8, but they are occupied at later turns, so if I go fast, I might pass before those times.\n\nFirst, from t=46, y=1.\n\nIf I go up every turn:\n\nt=46: y=1, choose U, y47=2\n\nt=47: y=2, choose U, y48=3\n\nt=48: y=3, choose U, y49=4\n\nt=49: y=4, choose U, y50=5\n\nt=50: y=5, choose U, y51=6\n\nt=51: y=6, choose U, y52=7\n\n etc.\n\nAt t=48, y=3, not occupied (only at t=46), safe.\n\nt=49, y=4, not occupied, safe.\n\nt=50, y=5, safe.\n\nt=51, y=6, T=51, y=6 occupied at T=48 and 49, not 51, so safe.\n\nThen t=52, y=7, T=52, occupied at T=56-58, not 52, safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can reach y=9 at t=54 as before.\n\nBut at t=51, y=6 is safe, yes.\n\nNow, to reach faster, I could have stayed higher or something, but I had to go down to avoid t=46.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=0 or y=9 directly, but y=9 is far.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=46, y=6 is safe, if I can be on y=6 at t=46.\n\nBut from y=3 at t=44, I can't reach y=6 in two steps; max y46=5.\n\nUnless I wait or something, but at t=44 and t=45, I can choose actions to position for t=46.\n\nBut from above, only y=1 is possible for safety at t=46.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=9 at t=46, but impossible from y=3 in two steps.\n\nSo no, I have to be on low y at t=46.\n\nThen from there, I go up.\n\nBut at t=48 and t=49, y=6 is occupied, but if I am not on y=6 at those turns, it's ok.\n\nIn the path above, at t=48, I am on y=3, at t=49 on y=4, both not y=6, so safe.\n\nThen at t=51, on y=6, which is safe since not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, for later times, y=7 and 8 occupied at t=56-59, but I can be on y=7 before that, at t=52, which is fine.\n\nIn the sequence, I reach y=9 at t=54.\n\nBut let's count the turns to reach y=9.\n\nFrom t=46, y=1, to y=9, that's 8 steps up.\n\nt=46 to t=54: from y=1 to y=9 in 8 steps, so at t=54, y=9.\n\nt=46: y=1\n\nt=47: y=2 (after U at t=46)\n\n...\n\nAfter 8 up actions, at t=54, y=9.\n\nActions from t=46 to t=53.\n\nBut we start from t=44.\n\nAt t=44 and t=45, I used two actions to go down to y=1 at t=46.\n\nSo total actions from t=44 to t=53: 10 actions, reaching y=9 at t=54.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =44 + H -1 =54, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=6 before t=48 or after t=49, but since I had to go down, it might not be faster.\n\nAnother idea: at t=44, I go up to y=4 at t=45, then at t=45, instead of moving vertically, I stay or something, but from y=4 at t=45, I can only go to y=3,4,5 at t=46, all unsafe.\n\nUnless I can move to y=6, but I can't in one step.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=0 at t=46.\n\ny=0 is safe.\n\nFor example, at t=44, go down to y=2 at t=45, then down to y=1 at t=46, or to y=0? y min is 0.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=45, I can go down to y=1, or if y=2, I can go down to y=1, not below 0.\n\ny=0 is possible.\n\nAt t=44, y=3, choose D, y45=2\n\nThen at t=45, y=2, choose D, y46=1, as before.\n\nOr at t=45, y=2, choose D, y46=1.\n\nIf I choose S, y46=2, unsafe.\n\nU to 3, unsafe.\n\nSo only D to y=1.\n\nFrom y=2, D to y=1, not to y=0, because Δy = -1 for D, so from y=2, D to y=1.\n\nTo reach y=0, I need to be at y=1 and go down.\n\nFor example, at t=45, if I were at y=1, I could go down to y=0.\n\nBut at t=45, I am at y=2 if I went down from t=44.\n\nSo from y=2, I can only go to y=1,2,3.\n\nNone of which are safe except y=1 for t=46.\n\nSo I have to be at y=1 at t=46.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nBut to save time, since y=6 is occupied at t=48,49, I should avoid being on y=6 at those turns.\n\nIn the path, I am on y=6 at t=51, which is after, so safe.\n\nI could reach y=6 earlier.\n\nFor example, from t=46 y=1, if I go up faster, but I can only go one per turn.\n\nAt t=46 y=1, U to y47=2\n\nt=47 y=2 U to y48=3\n\nt=48 y=3 U to y49=4\n\nt=49 y=4 U to y50=5\n\nt=50 y=5 U to y51=6\n\nt=51 y=6\n\nAs before.\n\nAt t=48, I am on y=3, not y=6.\n\nIf I could be on y=6 at t=47 or something, but from y=1 at t=46, I can only be at y=2 at t=47.\n\nNo faster.\n\nPerhaps from the beginning, I can stay at y=3 for some turns, but at t=46, y=3 is occupied, so I must not be on y=3 at t=46.\n\nSimilarly, I could go to y=4 at t=45, but then stuck for t=46.\n\nUnless I can move to a safe row at t=46 from there, but I can't.\n\nAnother thought: at t=45, on y=4, I can choose to go down to y=3, but at t=46 y=3 occupied, bad.\n\nOr stay, y=4 occupied, bad.\n\nOr up, y=5 occupied, bad.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=7 or 8 at t=46, but from y=3 at t=44, impossible in two steps.\n\nSo I think the only way is to go down to y=1 at t=46.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nBut let's check if I can optimize the up path.\n\nFor example, when going up from y=1, I pass through y=6 at t=51, which is safe.\n\ny=7 and 8 occupied at t=56-59, which is later, so I can be on them before.\n\nFor example, at t=52, y=7, safe; t=53 y=8, safe; t=54 y=9.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut total turns: from t=44 to t=54, 11 turns to reach at t=54.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach y=9 earlier by not going all the way down.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=6 at t=46, but I can't.\n\nAt t=44, I stay or something.\n\nSuppose at t=44, I choose S, so y45=3\n\nThen at t=45, on y=3, I need to choose a45 to set y46.\n\nBut y46 must be safe, so 0,1,6,7,8,9.\n\nFrom y=3, a45: U to 4, D to 2, S to 3, none of which are in {0,1,6,7,8,9}, so impossible.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up at t=44 to y=4 at t=45, same issue.\n\nOnly down to y=2 at t=45, then down to y=1 at t=46 works for t=46 safety.\n\nSo I think that's the only choice.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 44: D  (so from y=3 to y=2 at t=45? At turn t, action a_t sets y_{t+1}.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 44: choose a44 = D, so y45 = y44 + (-1) = 3-1=2\n\nTurn 45: position y=2, choose a45 = D, so y46 = 2-1=1\n\nTurn 46: position y=1, choose a46 = U, so y47 = 1+1=2\n\nTurn 47: position y=2, choose a47 = U, so y48 = 2+1=3\n\nTurn 48: position y=3, choose a48 = U, so y49 = 3+1=4\n\nTurn 49: position y=4, choose a49 = U, so y50 = 4+1=5\n\nTurn 50: position y=5, choose a50 = U, so y51 = 5+1=6\n\nTurn 51: position y=6, choose a51 = U, so y52 = 6+1=7\n\nTurn 52: position y=7, choose a52 = U, so y53 = 7+1=8\n\nTurn 53: position y=8, choose a53 = U, so y54 = 8+1=9\n\nNow at turn 54, position y=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 44 + H -1 =54, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nActions from t=44 to t=53, that's 10 actions? t=44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53: 10 actions.\n\nBut with 10 actions, we set y from 45 to 54, and y54=9, but y_{t_1 + H -1} with H=10 is y_{44+10-1}=y53=8 ≠9.\n\nProblem.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, for example, if I want y53=9.\n\nIn the sequence, y53=8.\n\nIf I can reach y=9 at an earlier turn.\n\nFor example, from y=1 at t=46, if I go up faster, but I can't, min 8 steps to y=9.\n\nStart from t=46 y=1, after k up actions, y_{46+k} =1+k.\n\nSet 1+k=9, k=8, so at turn 46+8=54, y=9.\n\nSimilarly, at t=44 y=3, to y=9, min 6 steps, but I had to detour.\n\nIn this case, with the detour, I reach at t=54.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, with t_1=44, set 44 + H -1 =54, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nThen the actions are from t=44 to t=44+10=54? But actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{53} for H=11? t_1 + H -1=44+11-1=54, but actions are a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, so a44 to a54? But a54 would set y55, which is not needed.\n\nI think I have a confusion with the indexing.\n\nLet me read the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\n\" to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\n\" such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9 \"\n\nAnd the actions are for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, with H actions, the last action is at t= t_1 + H -1, which sets y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which is set by the action at t_1 + H -2.\n\nIn the sequence, for y_{t_1 + H -1} to be 9, it must be set by a_{t_1 + H -2}.\n\nThe actions include a_{t_1 + H -1}, which sets the next, but we don't care.\n\nIn the output, we need to list actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nIn my sequence, to have y54=9, it is set by a53.\n\nSo we need a53 in the sequence.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =54, so for t_1=44, 44 + H -1=54, H-1=10, H=11.\n\nActions from a44 to a53.\n\nIn the list: a44 to a53, 10 actions? a44, a45, a46, a47, a48, a49, a50, a51, a52, a53: that's 10 actions for H=11? Indices from 44 to 53 inclusive is 10 actions.\n\n44 to 53 is 10 terms: 53-44+1=10.\n\nH actions, from t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor H=11, t from 44 to 44+10=54? t_1 + H -1 =44 +11-1=54.\n\nSo actions at t=44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54? That's 11 actions.\n\nBut the last action a54 sets y55, but we don't need it since we reach at turn 54.\n\nFor y_{54} to be 9, it is set by a53, so a53 is included, but a54 is not necessary.\n\nLet's see the range.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t_1}, t=1, a_{t_1+1}, ..., t=H-1, a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nWith this, after executing these H actions, we have set y from t_1+1 to t_1+H, and position at turn t_1 + H -1 is y_{t_1 + H -1}, which we want to be 9.\n\nFor example, with H=6, actions a44 to a49, set y45 to y50, and y_{49} should be 9.\n\nBut in our case, we reach y54=9, so y_{53} should be 9 for some, but y53=8.\n\nIn my sequence, y54=9, so to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =54, set t_1 + H -1=54, H-1=10, H=11.\n\nThen actions for t=0 to 10, a44 to a54.\n\na44 to a54 is 11 actions.\n\nBut a54 sets y55, which is not needed.\n\nPerhaps the action at t_1 + H -1 is not used to set the position, but it is part of the sequence.\n\nIn this case, for H=11, actions a44 to a54, but a54 is chosen, but since we already reached at turn 54, a54 might be redundant, but we have to include it.\n\nBut in the position, at turn 54, y54=9, which is set by a53.\n\na54 is chosen at turn 54, but it sets y55, which is after we reached.\n\nTo avoid this, perhaps we can reach at an earlier turn.\n\nFor example, if I can have y53=9.\n\nThen t_1 + H -1=53, 44 + H -1=53, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen actions from a44 to a53.\n\nIn this case, with H=10, we need y53=9.\n\nFrom start y44=3, to y53=9 in 9 steps? From t=44 to t=53, 9 turns, y from 3 to 9, difference 6, so possible in 6 steps, but with detour.\n\nIn my path, at t=53, y53=8, not 9.\n\nIf I can reach y=9 earlier.\n\nFor example, from t=46 y=1, to y=9 at t=53, that's 7 steps from t=46 to t=53? Positions: t=46 y=1, after 7 actions, y53=1+7=8, or y54=9.\n\nAfter k actions from t=46, y_{46+k} =1+k.\n\nSet 1+k=9, k=8, so at turn 46+8=54, y=9.\n\nAt turn 53, y53=8 if I start from t=46.\n\nSo I cannot reach y=9 at t=53 with this path.\n\nIs there a path to reach y=9 faster?\n\nFor example, after t=46, I am at y=1, but perhaps I can go up faster or something, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 is occupied at t=48 and t=49, I can be on y=6 at t=47 or before, or at t=50 or after.\n\nBut from y=1 at t=46, at t=47 I can be at y=2, t=48 at y=3, etc, cannot be at y=6 before t=51.\n\nAt t=51 y=6, which is after t=49, so safe.\n\nI could be on y=7 at t=46, but impossible.\n\nOr, at t=44, I go to y=4 at t=45, then at t=45, I go down to y=3, but then at t=46 on y=3 occupied.\n\nNot good.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at y=3 for multiple turns, but at t=46 it is occupied, so I must leave before or after, but at t=46 I cannot be on it.\n\nAt t=45, I can be on y=3, which is safe, but then for t=46, I have to move to a safe y, but from y=3, I can only go to y=2,3,4, all unsafe at t=46.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to go down to y=1 at t=46, then up to y=9 at t=54.\n\nWith H=11, actions from a44 to a54.\n\nBut a54 is not necessary, but for the sequence, it might be included.\n\nIn the action list, for H=11, actions at t=44 to t=54.\n\nBut at t=54, when I am at y=9, I don't need to move, but I might choose S or something.\n\nBut in the sequence, I need to specify the actions.\n\nIn my sequence, at t=53, I choose U to go to y=9 at t=54.\n\nThen at t=54, I am at y=9, and I can choose any action, but since I reached at turn t=54, and t_1 + H -1=54, position is 9, so for the action at t=54, it doesn't affect the position at t=54, so I can choose S or U or D, but it might cause issue if I go down, but since I only care about reaching at that turn, the action at that turn is part of the sequence but doesn't change the position at that turn.\n\nTo be safe, I can choose S at the last turn.\n\nBut in this case, for t=54, I choose a54=S, so y55=9, but we don't care.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence.\n\nBut to minimize H, perhaps I can have fewer actions by reaching earlier.\n\nSuppose I go to y=5 at some point.\n\nFor example, at t=44, I choose S, so y45=3\n\nThen at t=45, on y=3, I have to choose an action, but whatever I choose, y46 will be 2,3, or 4, all unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt t=44, go up to y=4 at t=45.\n\nThen at t=45, on y=4, I choose to go down to y=3, but y46=3 occupied.\n\nOr I can choose to go up to y=5, y46=5 occupied.\n\nOr stay, y46=4 occupied.\n\nAll bad.\n\nSo no other choices.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nNow for the sequence, I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=53, I choose U to set y54=9.\n\nThen at t=54, I need to choose an action for the sequence, since actions up to t_1 + H -1 =54.\n\nSo I can choose a54=S, for example.\n\nSimilarly, in the path, when I am on y=9, I can stay.\n\nBut for the output, let's list the actions from turn 44.\n\nAlso, for the up part, I can go directly.\n\nIn the sequence I have, from t=46 to t=53, I go up every turn, which is fine.\n\nBut at t=50, y=5, etc, all safe.\n\nNow, about freeway 7 and 8 occupied later, but I pass before, so no issue.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 44: D\n\nTurn 45: D\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: S  (since at y=9, I can stay)\n\nBut with a53=U, I set y54=9, so at turn 54, y=9.\n\nThen a54=S, sets y55=9, but not necessary.\n\nSince we reach at turn 54, and action at t=54 is part of sequence, I need to include it.\n\nBut to have minimal H, with this I have 11 actions.\n\nCan I reach at turn 53?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=9 at turn 53.\n\nThen from y44=3 to y53=9 in 9 steps, but with detour to low y.\n\nFrom start, to reach y=9 at turn 53.\n\nAt turn 53, y53=9.\n\nSet by a52.\n\nBut with the detour, at best, from t=46 y=1, to y53=9, that's 7 steps: from t=46 to t=53, 7 actions, y from 1 to 8, not 9.\n\ny53=8 if I start from t=46 with actions to t=52.\n\nAt t=46 y=1\n\na46 U, y47=2\n\n...\n\na52 U, y53=8\n\nThen to have y53=9, I need a52 to set y53=9, so from y52=8, a52=U.\n\nBut in this case, at turn 53, y53=9.\n\nBut how to get to y52=8.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=46, to y=8 at t=52.\n\nt=52 y=8.\n\nFrom t=46 y=1 to t=52 y=8, that's 6 steps: y increases by 7? Positions: t=46 y=1, after 6 actions, y52=1+6=7, not 8.\n\nAfter k actions from t=46, y_{46+k} =1+k.\n\nSet 1+k=8, k=7, so at turn 46+7=53, y53=8.\n\nThen to have y53=9, I need y53=9, so from above, at t=53 y=8, I need a53=U to set y54=9, but for turn 53 position, it is y53=8, not 9.\n\nTo have position at turn t=53 to be 9, I need y53=9, which must be set by a52.\n\nSo from y52, a52=U sets y53=9.\n\ny52 must be 8.\n\nBut from start, with the detour, at t=46 y=1, then to y52=8.\n\nt=52 y=8.\n\nFrom t=46 y=1, to t=52 y=8, that's 6 steps? Positions: t=46 y=1, after m actions up to t=51, y52 is set by a51.\n\nAfter actions from t=46 to t=51 (6 actions), y47 to y52 are set.\n\ny52 = y_{t=52} position at turn 52.\n\nAt t=46, y46=1\n\na46: U, y47=2\n\na47: U, y48=3\n\na48: U, y49=4\n\na49: U, y50=5\n\na50: U, y51=6\n\na51: U, y52=7\n\nSo at turn 52, y52=7\n\nThen a52: U, y53=8\n\nNot 9.\n\nTo have y52=8, I need to start from higher or something.\n\nBut I start from y=1 at t=46, so y52=7 as above.\n\nCannot be higher.\n\nTherefore, I cannot reach y=9 before t=54 with this path.\n\nThus minimal H is 11.\n\nNow for the sequence, I need to output the actions from turn 44 to turn 54 for H=11.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 54, I can choose S.\n\nAlso, in the beginning, I have two downs.\n\nIn the output format, it should be like:\n\nTurn 44: D\n\nTurn 45: D\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U  (to set y54=9)\n\nTurn 54: S  (stay, since reached)\n\nBut at turn 53, I choose U, which sets y54=9.\n\nAt turn 54, I choose S, which sets y55=9, but not necessary.\n\nSince the position is at turn t_1 + H -1=54, y54=9, and action at t=54 is part of the sequence, but it doesn't affect the reaching.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nTo save one action, but I can't.\n\nAnother thing: in the up part, from t=46 to t=53, I go up every turn, but I can go up faster? No.\n\nPerhaps at some point I can skip, but no.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nNow, about the cars on y=7 and 8, occupied at t=56-59, but I am on y=7 at t=52, y=8 at t=53, both before t=56, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at t=51, after t=49, safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nIn the output, I need to write it.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=44.\n\nH=11.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 44: D\n\nTurn 45: D\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: S\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut for turn 54, since I am at y=9, I can choose any, but S is fine.\n\nTo be precise, since I reached at turn 54, and action at t=54 doesn't matter, but I have to include it.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H could be less if I go directly, but I think not.\n\nAnother idea: at t=44, I go up to y=4 at t=45.\n\nThen at t=45, on y=4, I go down to y=3, but at t=46 on y=3 occupied, bad.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=5 at t=46, but occupied.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nThus the sequence.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 44\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by moving down to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 46 to avoid the collision at turn 46 on freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\), and then moving up directly to \\(y = 9\\), avoiding the occupied times on other freeways.\n\n- At turn 46, freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\) are occupied, so being on \\(y = 1\\) (safe at turn 46) is necessary.\n- Freeway \\(y = 6\\) is occupied at turns 48 and 49, but in the sequence, the player is on \\(y = 6\\) at turn 51 (after the occupied period), so it is safe.\n- Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are occupied at turns 56 to 59, but the player is on these freeways at turns 52 and 53 (before the occupied period), so they are safe.\n- The player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 54, which is safe as it has no cars.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- **Turn 44**: \\(D\\) (move down to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 45)\n- **Turn 45**: \\(D\\) (move down to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 46)\n- **Turn 46**: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 47)\n- **Turn 47**: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 48)\n- **Turn 48**: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 49)\n- **Turn 49**: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 50)\n- **Turn 50**: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 51)\n- **Turn 51**: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 52)\n- **Turn 52**: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 53)\n- **Turn 53**: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 54)\n- **Turn 54**: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 9\\), as the target is reached.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 54 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 44 + 11 - 1 = 54\\)) with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 44: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 45: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 46: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 47: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 48: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 50: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 51: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 52: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 53: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 54: S \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars move left or right at their speeds, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway at a certain turn, there's no car on that freeway whose span includes x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car positions at the current turn, which is t_1 = 46. The car states are given for this turn.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head -48, tail -95, direction right, speed 48. Since it's moving right, at turn T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]. Head and tail: head is at -48, tail at -95? That seems odd because if it's moving right, and head is less than tail? Let me read carefully.\n\nThe car update: for left-moving, span goes from h to τ, decreasing? I think I need to interpret head and tail properly.\n\nFrom the update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, at t_1, the span is from τ to h, with τ being the left end and h the right end? But in the freeway 1 entry, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, it might be that head is the front when moving.\n\nI think \"head\" and \"tail\" are defined relative to the direction. For a right-moving car, head is the right end, tail is the left end. Similarly for left-moving.\n\nIn freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48). Since it's right-moving, at t_1, tail is -95, head is -48? But tail should be less than head for right-moving? -95 < -48, so tail at -95, head at -48, so the car is from x=-95 to x=-48 at t_1.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, head is left, tail is right or something? Let's see.\n\nIn freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36). Left-moving, so at t_1, span [h, τ] = [48, 83]? But 48 to 83, and moving left, so decreasing x.\n\nIn the update, for left-moving, Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if h and τ are positions, with h being the head (front when moving left), so for left-moving, head is smaller x if x increases right, I assume.\n\nI think I need to set a coordinate system. Let's assume x increases to the right, so for a right-moving car, tail (left end) has smaller x, head (right end) has larger x. For left-moving, head (front) has smaller x? No.\n\nLet's clarify from the update rules.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] meaning from τ to h, with τ < h, and at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so τ is left, h is right.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]. Now, if h and τ are positions, for left-moving, h should be the right end? Because if it moves left, decreasing x, the head should be the leftmost point? I'm confused.\n\nPerhaps \"head\" is always the front, so for right-moving, front is right, so head has larger x; for left-moving, front is left, so head has smaller x.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and since it moves left, h decreases, τ decreases, so if h is head (front), it should be smaller than τ? But in the example, freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36), so h=48, τ=83, and [48,83], but 48 to 83, x from 48 to 83, moving left, so at t_1, the car is from 48 to 83, with head at 48? But if moving left, the front should be at smaller x, so 48 is left? 48 < 83, so head at 48, tail at 83? That doesn't make sense because tail should be behind.\n\nI think there's inconsistency in the notation. Let's look at the car state table.\n\nFor freeway 2: (48,37, right,12) and (0,-11, right,12)\n\nFor the first car: (48,37, right,12). If right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [37,48]? But it says head h=48, tail τ=37, so for right-moving, tail at 37, head at 48, so span from 37 to 48.\n\nSimilarly, (0,-11, right,12): tail at -11, head at 0, span from -11 to 0.\n\nFor freeway 4: (48,83, left,36), left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [48,83], so from 48 to 83, with head at 48? But if moving left, from higher x to lower x, so if x=83 is left, x=48 is right? No, x=48 to x=83, with 48<83, so from left to right, but moving left, so the head should be at the left end when moving left.\n\nI think I have a confusion in the coordinate system.\n\nAssume x-axis with increasing x to the right.\n\nFor a right-moving car (direction right), it moves to increasing x, so at time t, its position: the left end is tail, right end is head, so span [tail, head] with tail < head.\n\nFor a left-moving car (direction left), it moves to decreasing x, so at time t, its position: the right end is tail, left end is head, so span [head, tail] with head < tail, because head is left, tail is right.\n\nIn the update rule, for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] and it moves to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if h and τ are such that h < τ, then [h, τ] is from smaller to larger, but when it moves left, both decrease, so the car shifts left.\n\nIn freeway 4 example: (48,83, left,36), h=48, τ=83, so h=48 < τ=83, so span at t_1 from 48 to 83. Moving left, so at later time, positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, in freeway 2, (48,37, right,12): head=48, tail=37, so for right-moving, tail=37, head=48, span [37,48], moving right.\n\nIn the car state, for right-moving, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed) but head is larger, tail smaller.\n\nFor left-moving, (head, tail, direction, speed) with head smaller, tail larger? In freeway 4, head=48, tail=83, 48<83, so head < tail for left-moving.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48), right-moving, head=-48, tail=-95, since -48 > -95, so tail=-95, head=-48, span [-95,-48].\n\nOkay, I think I have it.\n\nSo at turn t_1=46, player at (0,0).\n\nI need to reach (0,9), so I need to move up to y=9.\n\ny from 0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, no cars, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nThe player starts at y=0, which is not a freeway, so no collision there. Similarly, y=9 is the goal, no cars.\n\nNow, I move by choosing U, D, S each turn, changing y by +1, -1, 0, clamped to [0,9].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if I am on freeway k (y_T = k) and for that freeway, at turn T, there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nIf I move to a different y at turn T, I am not on that y until the next turn? Let's see the note.\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut for the current position, at turn T, I am on y_T.\n\nAt turn T, I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nThen I choose a_T, which sets y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nCollision at turn T is based on y_T and the cars on that freeway at time T.\n\nIf I am on freeway k at turn T, and for that freeway, at time T, 0 is in some car's span, I collide.\n\nIf I move to a different freeway, at turn T I am still on the previous one, so for the new freeway, I am not on it until turn T+1.\n\nIn this case, at t_1=46, I am at y=0, which is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H, meaning I start at t_1, and after H-1 actions, at time t_1 + H - 1, I am at y=9.\n\nLet t be the turn index.\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nI choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t_1 to t_1 + H - 2? Let's see.\n\nI start at t_1, position (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0).\n\nAfter H-1 actions, at time t_1 + (H-1), y_{t_1 + (H-1)} = 9.\n\nThe actions are from t = t_1 to t = t_1 + H - 2, I think.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nI choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo from t = t_1 to t = t_1 + H - 2, I choose a_t, and at t = t_1 + H - 1, y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nAnd I need to reach at turn t_1 + H - 1.\n\nThe minimal H such that I can be at y=9 at some turn after H-1 steps.\n\nSince I start at y=0, and need to be at y=9, the minimum number of moves is 9 up moves, so H-1 = 9 if I go directly up, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be larger.\n\nBut I need to minimize H, so I want to go up as fast as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nNow, the cars move, so I need to check for each freeway, at each turn, if at x=0, it is occupied.\n\nSince the player is always at x=0, I only care about whether at time T, for freeway k, if k is occupied at x=0.\n\nThat is, if there is a car on freeway k with 0 in its span at time T.\n\nFor each freeway and each turn, I can compute if x=0 is occupied.\n\nThen, when I move to a freeway, I need that at that turn, it is not occupied.\n\nAlso, since I might stay or move, but I need to plan a path from y=0 to y=9, with the constraint that for each turn when I am on y=1 to 8, it must be safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nNow, let's list all cars and their positions over time.\n\nFirst, current turn t_1 = 46.\n\nFor each freeway, multiple cars might be present.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: right-moving, tail=-95, head=-48 at t=46, speed=48.\n\nSince right-moving, at time T, span: [τ + s(T-46), h + s(T-46)] = [-95 + 48(T-46), -48 + 48(T-46)]\n\nx=0 occupied when 0 is in [left, right], so -95 + 48ΔT <= 0 <= -48 + 48ΔT, where ΔT = T - 46.\n\nSo -95 + 48ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 48ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -95 + 48ΔT <= 0 => 48ΔT <= 95 => ΔT <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so ΔT <= 1 since integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 48ΔT => 48ΔT >= 48 => ΔT >= 1.\n\nSo for ΔT=1, both: -95 + 48(1) = -95 + 48 = -47 <=0, and 0 <= -48 + 48 =0, 0<=0 true, so occupied at T=46+1=47.\n\nFor ΔT=0, T=46: -95 <=0 <= -48? 0 <= -48 false, so not occupied at T=46.\n\nFor ΔT=2: -95 + 96 =1 <=0? 1<=0 false, and 0 <= -48 + 96 =48, true but first false, so not occupied.\n\nSo only at T=47, occupied.\n\nNow, freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37, right,12) — head=48, tail=37, right, s=12.\n\nAt t=46, span [37,48]\n\nAt T, [37 + 12ΔT, 48 + 12ΔT]\n\nx=0 occupied if 37 + 12ΔT <= 0 <= 48 + 12ΔT\n\nBut 37 + 12ΔT <=0? 12ΔT <= -37, impossible since ΔT >=0, so never occupied. Because min left is 37 >0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (0,-11, right,12) — head=0, tail=-11, right, s=12.\n\nAt t=46, span [-11,0] since tail=-11, head=0.\n\nAt T, [-11 + 12ΔT, 0 + 12ΔT] = [-11 + 12ΔT, 12ΔT]\n\nx=0 occupied if -11 + 12ΔT <= 0 <= 12ΔT\n\nFirst: -11 + 12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=11 => ΔT <=11/12<1, so for ΔT=0 only? ΔT=0: -11 <=0 <=0? 0<=0 true, but -11<=0 true, so yes at T=46.\n\nΔT=0: left=-11 <=0, right=0, 0<=0, so 0 is included.\n\nAt T=46, occupied.\n\nNow for other ΔT: ΔT=1, left= -11+12=1, right=12, 1<=0? false, not <=0.\n\nSo only at T=46 occupied for this car on freeway 2.\n\nBut freeway 2 has two cars, but the first one never has x=0, so only the second car matters, and it occupies x=0 only at T=46.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"3 | (48, 37, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12) |\"\n\nIdentical to freeway 2, so same situation: occupied only at T=46.\n\nFreeway 4: one car: (48,83, left,36) — head=48, tail=83, left-moving, s=36.\n\nAt t=46, span [48,83]? For left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [48,83], and since left-moving, h=48, τ=83, and head is left? Earlier we said for left-moving, head is smaller x, but here 48<83, so head=48, tail=83, moving left.\n\nAt T, Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] = [48 - 36ΔT, 83 - 36ΔT]\n\nx=0 occupied if 48 - 36ΔT <= 0 <= 83 - 36ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36ΔT <=0 => 48 <= 36ΔT => ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so ΔT >=2 since integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 83 - 36ΔT => 36ΔT <=83 => ΔT <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so ΔT <=2.\n\nSo for ΔT=2: first: 48 - 72 = -24 <=0 true, second: 0 <= 83 - 72 =11 true, so occupied at T=46+2=48.\n\nFor ΔT=1: 48-36=12 <=0? false.\n\nΔT=3: 48-108=-60<=0 true, but 0<=83-108=-25? false.\n\nSo only at T=48.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4? \"5 | (48, 83, left, 36) |\" yes, identical, so occupied only at T=48.\n\nFreeway 6: (-48, -59, right, 6) — head=-48, tail=-59? For right-moving, tail should be left, head right, so tail=-59, head=-48? -59 < -48, so tail=-59, head=-48.\n\nAt t=46, span [-59, -48]\n\nAt T, [-59 + 6ΔT, -48 + 6ΔT]\n\nx=0 occupied if -59 + 6ΔT <= 0 <= -48 + 6ΔT\n\nFirst: -59 + 6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=59 => ΔT <=59/6≈9.833, so ΔT <=9\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 6ΔT => 6ΔT >=48 => ΔT >=8\n\nSo for ΔT from 8 to 9 inclusive.\n\nΔT=8: left= -59+48= -11 <=0, right= -48+48=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nΔT=9: left= -59+54= -5 <=0, right= -48+54=6, 0<=6 true.\n\nΔT=7: left= -59+42= -17 <=0, but 0 <= -48+42= -6? false, 0<= -6 false.\n\nΔT=10: left= -59+60=1 <=0? false.\n\nSo occupied at T=46+8=54 and T=46+9=55.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst: (48,37, right,4) — similar to before, head=48, tail=37, right, s=4.\n\nAt T, [37 + 4ΔT, 48 + 4ΔT], min left 37>0, never at x=0.\n\nSecond: (0,-11, right,4) — head=0, tail=-11, right, s=4.\n\nAt T, [-11 + 4ΔT, 0 + 4ΔT] = [-11 + 4ΔT, 4ΔT]\n\nx=0 occupied if -11 + 4ΔT <= 0 <= 4ΔT\n\nFirst: -11 + 4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=11 => ΔT <= 11/4=2.75, so ΔT <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= 4ΔT always for ΔT>=0, but at ΔT=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nFor ΔT=0: left=-11<=0, right=0, 0<=0, occupied.\n\nΔT=1: left=-11+4=-7<=0, right=4, 0<=4 true, occupied.\n\nΔT=2: left=-11+8=-3<=0, right=8, 0<=8 true, occupied.\n\nΔT=3: left=-11+12=1<=0? false, not occupied.\n\nSo occupied at T=46,47,48.\n\nFreeway 8: (-48, -59, right, 3) — head=-48, tail=-59? tail=-59, head=-48, right, s=3.\n\nAt t=46, span [-59,-48]\n\nAt T, [-59 + 3ΔT, -48 + 3ΔT]\n\nx=0 occupied if -59 + 3ΔT <= 0 <= -48 + 3ΔT\n\nFirst: -59 + 3ΔT <=0 => 3ΔT <=59 => ΔT <=59/3≈19.666, ΔT<=19\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 3ΔT => 3ΔT >=48 => ΔT >=16\n\nSo for ΔT from 16 to 19 inclusive.\n\nΔT=16: left= -59+48= -11 <=0, right= -48+48=0, 0<=0 true\n\nΔT=17: left= -59+51= -8 <=0, right= -48+51=3, 0<=3 true\n\nΔT=18: left= -59+54= -5 <=0, right= -48+54=6, 0<=6 true\n\nΔT=19: left= -59+57= -2 <=0, right= -48+57=9, 0<=9 true\n\nΔT=15: left= -59+45= -14 <=0, but 0 <= -48+45= -3? false\n\nΔT=20: left= -59+60=1 <=0? false\n\nSo occupied at T=46+16=62 to 46+19=65, i.e., T=62,63,64,65.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the turns when x=0 is occupied (unsafe):\n\n- Freeway 1: occupied at T=47\n\n- Freeway 2: occupied at T=46 (from the second car)\n\n- Freeway 3: occupied at T=46\n\n- Freeway 4: occupied at T=48\n\n- Freeway 5: occupied at T=48\n\n- Freeway 6: occupied at T=54,55\n\n- Freeway 7: occupied at T=46,47,48 (from the second car)\n\n- Freeway 8: occupied at T=62,63,64,65\n\nFor freeways with no cars, like y=1 only one car, but we have all freeways listed, I think.\n\ny=1 to 8 all have cars.\n\nNow, for each freeway, the safe turns are when not occupied.\n\nSince we care about when the player is on it, we need for each possible turn and freeway, if it is safe to be there.\n\nBut the player moves step by step.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we should try to go up as fast as possible.\n\nStart at t=46, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nEach move up increases y by 1, so minimum 9 moves up, but we might need to stay or go down to avoid bad times.\n\nThe actions: from t=46, we choose a_t for t=46 to t=46 + H - 2, and at t=46 + H - 1, y=9.\n\ny_t at time t.\n\nAt t=46, y=0.\n\nAfter first action, at t=47, y could be 1 or 0 or -1 but clamped, min y=0.\n\nSimilarly, max y=9.\n\nWe need y_{t} for t from 46 to some T with y_T=9.\n\nThe time to reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and need y=9, the minimal time is 9 turns if we go up every time, but we might collide.\n\nSo let's see the constraints.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the forbidden turns.\n\nFreeway k unsafe at turns:\n\n- y=1: unsafe at T=47\n\n- y=2: unsafe at T=46\n\n- y=3: unsafe at T=46\n\n- y=4: unsafe at T=48\n\n- y=5: unsafe at T=48\n\n- y=6: unsafe at T=54,55\n\n- y=7: unsafe at T=46,47,48\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=62,63,64,65\n\nFor other turns, safe.\n\nNow, player path: we need to be at y_t at turn t, and if y_t between 1 and 8, it must be safe at that turn.\n\ny_t=0 or 9 always safe.\n\nStart at t=46, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal H: since we need to increase y by 9, the minimal number of turns after start is 9, if we go up every turn.\n\nTry that: go up at each turn.\n\nAt t=46: y=0, safe.\n\nChoose a=U, so at t=47, y=1.\n\nNow, at t=47, y=1, which is freeway 1, and freeway 1 unsafe at T=47, so collision! Cannot be on y=1 at t=47.\n\nSo direct up not possible at first step.\n\nNeed to avoid t=47 for y=1.\n\nSimilarly, other constraints.\n\nSince we want minimal time, we should go up as fast as possible but avoid the bad times.\n\nList the times we need to be careful.\n\nFirst, for y=1, only unsafe at t=47, so we can be on y=1 at other times, but since we are moving, we need to be there at some turn.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nWe can think of the path in terms of when we are on each y.\n\nBut since we move one step at a time, the turn when we arrive at a y.\n\nDefine the time when we are at y=k.\n\nStart at y=0, t=46.\n\nWhen we move to y=1, we are at y=1 at some turn t>46.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nThe time we spend on each y, but since we might stay or move, it's the turn when we are on that y.\n\nFor y=0, we start at t=46.\n\nThen when we first move up, we go to y=1 at t=47 if we move at t=46.\n\nBut we might delay.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=9, we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal time: let's see the earliest we can be at each y.\n\nStart at y=0, t=46.\n\nTo go to y=1: we can be at y=1 at t=47 only if we move up at t=46, but at t=47, y=1 is unsafe, so we cannot be on y=1 at t=47.\n\nTherefore, we cannot move up at t=46; we must stay or move down, but y=0 is safe, so we can stay at y=0 for some turns.\n\nSince y=0 is safe, we can stay there.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nNext, when can we be on y=1.\n\ny=1 unsafe only at t=47, so safe at t=46? t=46 we are at y=0, not on y=1.\n\nAt t=46, we are on y=0.\n\nTo be on y=1, at some t>46.\n\ny=1 unsafe only at t=47, so for t !=47, it is safe.\n\nSo we can be on y=1 at t=48 or later.\n\nSimilarly, for other y.\n\nBut we have to go through all y.\n\nNow, let's consider moving up.\n\nAt t=46, if we stay, y=47 still 0, then at t=47, we can choose to move up or stay.\n\nIf we move up at t=47, then at t=48, y=1.\n\nAt t=48, y=1 is safe, since only unsafe at t=47.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut we have constraints on higher y.\n\nFirst, let's list all the unsafe times for each y:\n\n- y=1: unsafe only t=47\n\n- y=2: unsafe t=46 — but t=46 we are not on y=2, we are on y=0. At t=46, y=2 is unsafe, but we are not there. For future, y=2 unsafe only at t=46? t=46 is past, or do we consider t>=46?\n\nt is the turn index, starting from t_1=46.\n\nAt t=46, for y=2, it is unsafe, but since we are not on it, it doesn't matter. We care about when we are on it.\n\nFor y=2, it is unsafe only at t=46, which is now, and we are not on it, so for t>46, y=2 is always safe, since no other unsafe times.\n\nSimilarly, y=3: unsafe only at t=46, so for t>46, always safe.\n\ny=4: unsafe at t=48\n\ny=5: unsafe at t=48\n\ny=6: unsafe at t=54,55\n\ny=7: unsafe at t=46,47,48\n\nBut t=46 and t=47 are past or current? t=46 is now, we are on y=0, not y=7. So for t>46, y=7 unsafe at t=47 and t=48? t=47 and t=48.\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=46,47,48.\n\nT=46: now, we not on it.\n\nT=47: future\n\nT=48: future\n\nSo for t>=47, y=7 unsafe at t=47 and t=48, safe otherwise.\n\ny=8: unsafe at t=62 to 65.\n\nNow, back to path.\n\nWe start at t=46, y=0.\n\nWe cannot move to y=1 immediately because at t=47 y=1 unsafe.\n\nSo we must not be on y=1 at t=47.\n\nTherefore, at t=46, we cannot choose U; we must choose S or D.\n\nIf we choose D, y=47 would be -1, but clamped to 0, so same as S? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with y in [0,9], so if y=0 and choose D, y_{t+1} = max(0, -1) =0, same as S.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, U does nothing.\n\nSo at y=0, D and S both keep y=0.\n\nSimilarly at y=9.\n\nSo at t=46, since we cannot go to y=1 at t=47, we must choose S or D, both keep y=0 at t=47.\n\nSo at t=47, y=0, safe.\n\nNow at t=47, we can choose action.\n\nIf we choose U, then at t=48, y=1.\n\nAt t=48, y=1 is safe, as we said.\n\nThen we can go to y=2 at t=49, and so on.\n\nBut we need to check higher y.\n\nAt t=47, y=0.\n\nChoose U: at t=48, y=1.\n\ny=1 at t=48 safe.\n\nThen at t=48, we can choose U to go to y=2 at t=49.\n\ny=2 at t=49: since y=2 unsafe only at t=46, safe at t=49.\n\nSimilarly, at t=49, choose U to y=3 at t=50.\n\ny=3 unsafe only at t=46, safe at t=50.\n\nThen at t=50, choose U to y=4 at t=51.\n\nNow y=4 unsafe at t=48, but t=51 >48, so should be safe? But we need to check if there are other constraints.\n\ny=4 has car only unsafe at t=48, as per earlier.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 unsafe only at t=48.\n\nSo at t=51, y=4 should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, go to y=5 at t=52, safe.\n\ny=6 at t=53.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=54 and 55, so at t=53, should be safe.\n\nThen y=7 at t=54.\n\nBut y=7 unsafe at t=54? y=7 unsafe at t=46,47,48, and t=54 not among them, so safe at t=54?\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=46,47,48, so for t=54, safe.\n\nThen y=8 at t=55.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=62-65, t=55 not, so safe.\n\nThen y=9 at t=56.\n\ny=9 always safe.\n\nSo if we go up continuously from t=47 onwards, we can reach y=9 at t=56.\n\nLet's list the turns:\n\nt=46: y=0, choose S or D? At t=46, we choose action to set y_{t+1}.\n\nAt t=46, we choose a_{46}, which sets y_{47}.\n\nBut we cannot set y_{47} to 1, so we choose S or D, so y_{47} = 0.\n\nAt t=47, y=0, we choose U, so y_{48} =1.\n\nAt t=48, y=1, choose U, so y_{49} =2.\n\nAt t=49, y=2, choose U, so y_{50} =3.\n\nAt t=50, y=3, choose U, so y_{51} =4.\n\nAt t=51, y=4, choose U, so y_{52} =5.\n\nAt t=52, y=5, choose U, so y_{53} =6.\n\nAt t=53, y=6, choose U, so y_{54} =7.\n\nAt t=54, y=7, choose U, so y_{55} =8.\n\nAt t=55, y=8, choose U, so y_{56} =9.\n\nNow, we need to check for each turn when on freeway, if safe.\n\nAt t=48, y=1: freeway 1, unsafe at t=47, not at t=48, so safe.\n\nt=49, y=2: freeway 2, unsafe only at t=46, not t=49, safe.\n\nt=50, y=3: freeway 3, unsafe only at t=46, not t=50, safe.\n\nt=51, y=4: freeway 4, unsafe at t=48, not t=51, safe.\n\nt=52, y=5: freeway 5, unsafe at t=48, not t=52, safe.\n\nt=53, y=6: freeway 6, unsafe at t=54 and 55, not t=53, so safe.\n\nt=54, y=7: freeway 7, unsafe at t=46,47,48, not t=54, so safe.\n\nt=55, y=8: freeway 8, unsafe at t=62-65, not t=55, so safe.\n\nt=56, y=9, safe.\n\nIn this path, we never are on a freeway at a bad time.\n\nAnd we reach y=9 at t=56.\n\nNow, the number of turns: we start at t=46, and at t=56 we are at y=9.\n\nSo the time from start to reach is t=56, so H such that t_1 + H - 1 =56.\n\nt_1=46, so 46 + H -1 =56, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nActions from t=46 to t=55? Let's see.\n\nWe take actions from t=46 to t=55 to set positions up to t=56.\n\nAt turn t, we choose a_t for t from t_1 to t_1 + H - 2, and at t_1 + H -1, position reached.\n\nHere, actions at t=46 to t=55, 10 actions, and at t=56, y=9.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=46: choose S or D, both same, say S.\n\nThen y_{47}=0.\n\nt=47: choose U, y_{48}=1\n\nt=48: choose U, y_{49}=2\n\nt=49: choose U, y_{50}=3\n\nt=50: choose U, y_{51}=4\n\nt=51: choose U, y_{52}=5\n\nt=52: choose U, y_{53}=6\n\nt=53: choose U, y_{54}=7\n\nt=54: choose U, y_{55}=8\n\nt=55: choose U, y_{56}=9\n\nSo actions: t=46: S, t=47: U, t=48: U, ..., up to t=55: U.\n\nThat's 10 actions: one S and nine U's, but from t=47 to t=55 all U, that's 9 U, and t=46 S.\n\nTotal actions: 10, from t=46 to t=55.\n\nH=11, since we reach at t=56.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nWe could go faster? For example, if we go up at t=46, but we cannot because at t=47 y=1 unsafe.\n\nIf we go up later but faster? But we delayed one turn at start.\n\nWithout delay, we could be at y=1 at t=47, but unsafe, so impossible.\n\nAt higher y, we might need to avoid, but in this case, we didn't have to avoid other points because we passed before or after the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, y=6 unsafe at t=54,55, we were at y=6 at t=53, which is before, safe.\n\ny=7 at t=54, safe, since unsafe only up to t=48.\n\ny=8 at t=55, safe.\n\nNow, could we reach earlier?\n\nSuppose at t=46, we go up, but cannot, collision at t=47.\n\nIf we go down, but y=0 min, cannot go down.\n\nSo must stay at y=0 for one turn.\n\nThen from t=47, go up each turn.\n\nFirst move to y=1 at t=48, then y=2 at t=49, ..., y=9 at t=56, as above.\n\nt=48: y=1, t=49: y=2, ..., t=56: y=9, that's 9 steps up, but started from y=0 at t=47? At t=47 y=0, after actions.\n\nt=47: y=0, after action U, y_{48}=1\n\nThen y_{49}=2, ..., y_{56}=9.\n\nSo from y=0 at t=47 to y=9 at t=56, that took 9 turns to increase 9 levels, but we had one turn of waiting at start.\n\nTotal time from t=46 to t=56 is 11 turns, with y=9 at t=56.\n\nIs there a way to save a turn?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=1 earlier, but t=47 is the only chance for immediate, but unsafe.\n\nOr later, but we are at t=48.\n\nPerhaps for other freeways, we can go slower or faster to avoid.\n\nBut in this case, since we pass y=6 at t=53, before unsafe at 54,55; if we were later at y=6, might hit unsafe.\n\nBut we are early, so fine.\n\nSuppose we don't wait at start, but go up at t=46, but collision, impossible.\n\nPerhaps go to y=1 at t=48, as we did.\n\nAnother thing: at t=47, when we are at y=0, we could go to y=1? If we choose U at t=47, y_{48}=1, which we did.\n\nBut y=1 at t=48 is safe.\n\nCould we go directly to higher y? No, only one step per turn.\n\nPerhaps we can skip some y by moving faster, but we have to go through each y sequentially, since we move one y at a time.\n\nThe player must visit each y from 0 to 9, in order, but can stay or go down, but to minimize time, we should not go down.\n\nIn this path, we go directly up with one turn delay at start.\n\nTotal turns: start t=46, end t=56, 11 turns.\n\nBut H is the minimal number of turns, meaning the number of actions or the time?\n\nIn the problem: \"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\"\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nSo H is the number of actions in the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, so H actions, reaching at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\n\"sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at t_1 + t, for t=0 to H-1.\n\nThen after these H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is set? No.\n\nAfter action at time τ, it sets y_{τ+1}.\n\nAt time t_1, we start with position y_{t_1}.\n\nThen we choose action a_{t_1}, which sets y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nThen choose a_{t_1 +1}, sets y_{t_1 +2}, ..., up to choose a_{t_1 + H -1}, which sets y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nAnd we need y_{t_1 + H} =9? No.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so actions at times: t_1 +0, t_1 +1, ..., t_1 + (H-1)\n\nAfter these actions, the position at time t_1 + H is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nAnd we need y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the text: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\n\"reach at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1 for the index.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions at t_1 +0, and reach at t_1 +1 -1 = t_1? Inconsistency.\n\nSuppose H=1: sequence with one action, a_{t_1}, which sets y_{t_1 +1}, and we need to reach at turn t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +1 -1 = t_1.\n\nBut at turn t_1, we are at y_{t_1}, before action.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, we are at y_{t_1 +1} at turn t_1 +1.\n\nBut we need to reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor H=1, reach at turn t_1 +0 = t_1, which is the initial position.\n\nBut we need to reach (0,9), which may not be initial.\n\nIn this case, initial y=0, not 9.\n\nSo minimal H must be such that we can reach at t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have set positions up to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=9 is t_1 + H -1? I think there is confusion.\n\nFrom the player update: at turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter choosing a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nThe sequence of actions: we choose a_t for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter choosing a_{t_1 + H -1}, we have y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we need to be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nThat is, at the turn before the last action sets the position.\n\nLet's see the reach time.\n\nIn the text: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, suppose we start at t_1, y_{t_1}.\n\nAfter choosing a_{t_1}, we have y_{t_1 +1}.\n\n...\n\nAfter choosing a_{t_1 + H -2}, we have y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nThen we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThen the last action a_{t_1 + H -1} is chosen, but it sets y_{t_1 + H}, which we don't care if we reach at t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn the sequence, we have H actions, from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAnd position at t_1 + H -1 is set by previous actions.\n\nIn the path above, we have:\n\nAt t=46, y=0.\n\nWe want y_{t} for some t.\n\nIn our plan, we have y_{56} =9.\n\nt=56 = t_1 + 10, since t_1=46, 46+10=56.\n\nNow, y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{46 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo 46 + H -1 =56, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nActions from t=46 to t=46 +11 -1 = t=46 to 55? t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at times: t_1 +0, t_1 +1, ..., t_1 + (H-1)\n\nIn this case, actions at t=46,47,48,..., up to t=46 + (H-1)\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith y_{56}=9, t_1 + H -1=56, 46 + H -1=56, H-1=10, H=11.\n\nActions at t=46 to t=46+10=56? t_1 + (H-1) =46 +10=56.\n\nBut action at t=56 sets y_{57}, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify actions only up to when we reach.\n\nIn the plan: we need to reach at t=56, so y_{56}=9.\n\nTo have y_{56}=9, we need to set it with action at t=55.\n\nSimilarly, y_{56} is set by action at t=55.\n\nIn general, y_{t+1} is set by action at t.\n\nSo to have y_T =9, it is set by action at T-1.\n\nBut in the sequence, we include actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the action at t, it sets y_{t+1}.\n\nFor example, at t=55, action sets y_{56}.\n\nSo if we want y_{56}=9, action at t=55 should be U or S if y_{55}=9, but we move to it.\n\nIn our case, with H=11, actions at t=46 to t=56? t_1 to t_1 + H -1 =46 to 46+10=56.\n\nBut action at t=56 sets y_{57}, which is after we reached.\n\nPerhaps H includes the actions to reach.\n\nIn our path:\n\nActions:\n\nAt t=46: choose S (or D), so y_{47}=0\n\nAt t=47: choose U, so y_{48}=1\n\n...\n\nAt t=55: choose U, so y_{56}=9\n\nNow, we have actions from t=46 to t=55, that's 10 actions.\n\nt=46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55: 10 actions.\n\nAfter these, y_{56}=9, reached at turn t=56.\n\nNow, t_1 + H -1 =46 + H -1 =56, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nWith H=11, actions at t=46 to t=56? t_1 + H -1 =46 +11 -1=56, so actions at t=46 to t=56.\n\nBut action at t=56 sets y_{57}, which is not needed.\n\nI think I have a off-by-one.\n\nLet's read the answer format.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\"\n\n\"Turn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1}\"\n\n...\n\nup to Turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}? No.\n\nIn the box, it says:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nSo it lists actions for turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to some turn.\n\nAnd we reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action listed is for turn t_1 + H -1, which sets y_{t_1 + H}, but we reach at turn t_1 + H -1, so the position at that turn is set by previous action.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y_{t_1 + H -1}, which is 9.\n\nThis is set by action at t_1 + H -2.\n\nThe action at t_1 + H -1 sets y_{t_1 + H}, which may not be 9 if we stop.\n\nIn the sequence, we include actions up to t_1 + H -1, but it sets the next position, which is after reaching.\n\nI think it's consistent with the reach time.\n\nIn our case, with 10 actions: from t=46 to 55, we set y from 47 to 56, with y_{56}=9, reached at turn 56.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =46 + H -1 =56, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nThe sequence has 11 actions? 10 actions from t=46 to 55.\n\nt=46 to 55 inclusive is 10 turns: 55-46+1=10 actions.\n\nH should be the number of actions.\n\nThen t_1 + H -1 =46 +10 -1=55, but at turn 55, y=8, not 9. We reach at turn 56.\n\nMistake.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} should be 9.\n\nWith H actions, from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H} is set, but we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the action sequence, the position at turn t_1 + H -1 is set by action at t_1 + H -2.\n\nFor example, to have y_T=9, we need to have chosen actions such that at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nThe actions from t_1 to T-1 set the positions up to y_T.\n\nSpecifically, action at t sets y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to have y_T=9, we need actions from t_1 to T-1.\n\nThen the number of actions is (T - t_1).\n\nThen H = T - t_1.\n\nAnd we reach at turn T = t_1 + H.\n\nBut the text says reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nAssume from the text.\n\nSuppose minimal case: if we start at y=9, then at turn t_1, we are at (0,9), so we reach at turn t_1, with no actions, but H=1? Sequence from t=0 to H-1, if H=1, t=0, action at t_1, but it sets y_{t_1+1}, not y_{t_1}.\n\nBut we are already at y_{t_1}=9.\n\nSo for that, H should be 0, but sequence empty.\n\nBut the problem says \"sequence of actions\", so probably H>=1, or for this case not considered.\n\nIn this case, we start at y=0, not 9.\n\nTo reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn our path, we reach at turn 56.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =56.\n\nt_1=46, so 46 + H -1 =56, H-1=10, H=11.\n\nActions from t=46 to t=46 +11 -1 = t=46 to 55? t_1 to t_1 + H -1 =46 to 46+10=56? t_1 + H -1 =46 +11 -1=56.\n\nSo actions at t=46 to t=56.\n\nBut action at t=56 sets y_{57}, which is not used.\n\nIn the sequence, for t=46 to t=55, we have 10 actions, setting y to 56.\n\nThen for H=11, we include action at t=56, but it doesn't affect the reaching at t=56.\n\nPerhaps in the sequence, we list actions up to the one that sets the reach position.\n\nI think it's messy.\n\nFrom the answer format, it lists \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" to \"Turn t_1 + something\", and we reach at t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn our case, with actions at t=46: S, t=47: U, ..., t=55: U, we have y at t=47 to t=56.\n\ny_{t_1} = y_{46} =0, not 9.\n\ny_{47}=0, y_{48}=1, ..., y_{56}=9.\n\nSo at turn t=56, we are at y=9.\n\nt=56 = t_1 + 10.\n\nNow, t_1 + H -1 =56, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nThen the sequence should include actions from t=46 to t=46+10=56? But action at t=56 sets y_{57}, which may be anything.\n\nPerhaps for the sequence, we only need to specify actions until we reach, but the last action is to set the position.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's look at the minimal H.\n\nIn this path, we can reach at turn 56 with 10 actions from t=46 to 55.\n\nBut with H=10, t_1 + H -1 =46+10-1=55, but at turn 55, y=8, not 9.\n\nSo we need H such that t_1 + H -1 =56, so H=11, and actions from t=46 to t=56.\n\nThen at t=56, we choose an action, but since we already reached at turn 56, it doesn't matter, we can choose S or U, but y=9, U does nothing.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence, for t=56, we can choose S, for example.\n\nBut in the path, we don't need that action.\n\nPerhaps the sequence includes the actions to stay or move after reaching, but we just need to reach at that turn.\n\nI think for this problem, since we reach at turn 56, and H=11, actions from t=46 to t=56.\n\nBut let's confirm with the car constraints.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 7, we were at y=7 at t=54, which is safe.\n\nBut freeway 7 has cars that are unsafe at t=46,47,48, so t=54 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=1 at t=48, but earlier? t=47 is unsafe, so no.\n\nAt t=46, we stay, then at t=47, we are at y=0, we could go to y=1? But at t=47, if we choose U, y_{48}=1, same as before.\n\nAt t=47, we are at y=0, we could choose to stay again, but that would delay more, worse.\n\nSo minimal is to go up from t=47.\n\nPerhaps for y=7, it is unsafe at t=47 and 48, but we are at t=54, late, so fine.\n\nAnother point: y=6 unsafe at t=54 and 55, we are at y=6 at t=53, which is before, safe.\n\nIf we were slower, we might hit, but we are fast.\n\nSuppose we go up at t=46, but cannot.\n\nOr, perhaps at t=46, we go down, but y=0, cannot.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach by t=55 or earlier.\n\nEarliest possible: if no cars, we can be at y=9 at t=46 +9 =55, by going up each turn from t=46 to t=54, setting y_{47} to y_{55}=9.\n\nBut at t=47, y=1 unsafe, so impossible to be at y=1 at t=47.\n\nNext, be at y=1 at t=48, then y=9 at t=56, as above.\n\nIf we could be at y=1 at t=48, y=2 at t=49, ..., but y=7 at t=54, which is safe, but y=6 at t=53, safe, etc.\n\nCan we save a turn at higher levels?\n\nFor example, if we skip a move or something, but we have to move step by step.\n\nSuppose at some point we go down to avoid, but that would increase time.\n\nFor example, to avoid y=6 at t=54 or 55, but since we are before, no need.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, with H=11.\n\nActions: from t=46 to t=56.\n\nBut t=46 to t=56 is 11 actions.\n\nNow, for t=46: S (stay)\n\nt=47: U\n\nt=48: U\n\n...\n\nt=55: U\n\nt=56: ? but we reach at turn t=56, so at t=56, we are at y=9, we need to choose an action, but it doesn't matter, we can choose S.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence, we must specify.\n\nIn the path, at t=55, we choose U to set y_{56}=9.\n\nThen at t=56, we choose say S, to keep y=9, but since we reached at t=56, it is fine.\n\nThe action at t=56 is part of the sequence for H=11.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nSince we reach at t_1 + H -1, and for t=56, it is the reach turn.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nWith H=11, t_1 + H -1=56, so actions at t=46 to t=56.\n\nAt t=56, we need to choose an action, but since y=9, we can choose S.\n\nIn the car constraints, at turn t=56, we are at y=9, not on freeway, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, in the sequence:\n\nTurn 46: S (or D, but same)\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U  (this sets y_{56}=9)\n\nTurn 56: S  (or U, but stay)\n\nBut we reached at turn 56, so action at t=56 is extra.\n\nPerhaps H should be such that the last action sets the position.\n\nI think for the answer, we can list the actions as above for t=46 to t=55, with H=10, but then reach at t=56, which is t_1 +10, but t_1 + H -1=46+10-1=55, not 56.\n\nSo to match, we need H=11.\n\nPerhaps the \"turns H\" includes the starting point or something.\n\nAnother way: the number of turns from start to end.\n\nFrom turn 46 to turn 56, 11 turns have passed, but we are at turn 56.\n\nI think it's better to proceed with the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be clear.\n\nNow, back to the car on freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 has two cars, but we only considered the one that affects x=0.\n\nIn freeway 7, cars: (48,37, right,4) and (0,-11, right,4)\n\nThe first car never at x=0, second at x=0 for t=46,47,48.\n\nAt t=54, no car at x=0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nIn our path, we have y=7 at t=54, which is fine.\n\nBut is there a problem at other points?\n\ny=4 at t=51, safe, etc.\n\nBut let's confirm the time for freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4: car unsafe at t=48 only.\n\nt=51>48, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster by not waiting at start, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: at t=46, we stay, at t=47, we are at y=0, we could go directly to y=2? No, only one step.\n\nWe must go through y=1.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see the answer.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 6, unsafe at t=54,55, we are at y=6 at t=53, which is safe, but if we could be at y=6 later, but we want fast, so early is better.\n\nSuppose we delay at some point to avoid y=7 at t=47 or something, but we are not there.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo sequence: actions from t=46 to t=56, but for t=56, action not necessary.\n\nIn the sequence for H=11, we include t=56 action.\n\nBut in the output, we can write.\n\nSince at turn t=56, we are at y=9, and we choose S, for example.\n\nNow, in the list:\n\nTurn 46: S\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U  (sets y_{56}=9)\n\nTurn 56: S  (but y_{57} remains 9, not needed)\n\nBut for the sequence, it should be up to the action that sets the position before reaching or something.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nTo have exactly H actions with reach at t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, with 10 actions: t=46 to 55, we reach at t=56.\n\nBut t_1 + H -1 =46 +10 -1=55, not 56.\n\nSo we need to set y_{55}=9.\n\nBut we reach at t=56 with y_{56}=9.\n\nThe only way to reach earlier is to be at y=9 at t=55.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=55, we need to start from y=0 at t=46, go up 9 times in 9 turns: from t=46 to t=54 actions U, setting y_{47}=1, y_{48}=2, ..., y_{55}=9.\n\nBut at t=47, y=1 unsafe, collision.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSo cannot reach before t=56.\n\nThus minimal to reach at t=56 with H=11.\n\nActions as above.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the output, for turn t_1=46, etc.\n\nAlso, in freeway 2 and 3, at t=46 occupied, but we not on it.\n\nIn our path, no issue.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nTurn 46: S (or D, but S is fine)\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: S (arbitrary)\n\nBut for turn 56, since we reached, perhaps we don't need to specify, but the sequence must have H actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed.\n\nPerhaps H is the number of turns including the start, but let's not overcomplicate.\n\nI think with H=11, actions as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, from t=46 to t=55, 10 actions, but we need 11 for the formula.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the \"minimal number of turns H\" means the number of turns from start to end, so from turn 46 to 56, 11 turns, with actions on turns 46 to 55, 10 actions.\n\nBut the sequence is given for the actions.\n\nI think it's consistent to have H actions.\n\nIn this case, for the sequence, we have 10 actions to reach, but with H=11 including the last stay or something.\n\nI think for the answer, we can provide:\n\nTurn 46: S\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nAnd H=11, but only 10 actions listed? From t=46 to t=55, that's 10 turns.\n\nt=46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55: 10 actions.\n\nThen with H=11, we need one more action at t=56.\n\nSo Turn 56: S\n\nBut it is redundant.\n\nPerhaps the reach at turn t_1 + H -1 with the actions.\n\nI think for this problem, since we need to reach (0,9) and avoid collisions, the action at t=56 doesn't affect, so we can include it with S.\n\nNow, for the car on freeway 8, unsafe late, not relevant.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the initial, for freeway 6, we have unsafe at t=54,55, but we are at y=6 at t=53, so fine.\n\nBut let's confirm t=53 y=6.\n\nFreeway 6: car unsafe at t=54 and 55.\n\nAt t=53, for freeway 6, is it safe?\n\nFrom earlier: freeway 6 car at T, for ΔT=T-46.\n\nOccupied when ΔT=8 or 9, i.e., T=54 or 55.\n\nAt T=53, ΔT=7, left= -59 +6*7= -59+42= -17, right= -48+42= -6, so [-17,-6], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 46: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 47: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 48: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 50: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 51: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 52: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 53: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 54: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 55: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 56: S \\end{array} }\n\nBut H=11, and reach at turn 56.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at turn 56, which is not necessary, but for completeness.\n\nSince at turn 55, we choose U to go to y=9 at turn 56, and we reach at turn 56.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nTo have only necessary actions, but with H=11.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 10, but we reach at turn 56, which is t_1 +10, but the formula requires t_1 + H -1, so for H=10, t_1 +9=55, not 56.\n\nSo we must use H=11.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 46\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11. This means the player reaches (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 46 + 11 - 1 = 56\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) by incorporating a wait at the start to avoid the unsafe condition on freeway \\(y = 1\\) at turn 47. Specifically:\n- At turn 46, staying (S) avoids moving to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 47, which is unsafe due to a car on freeway 1.\n- From turn 47 to turn 55, moving up (U) each turn progresses the player to \\(y = 9\\) by turn 56, avoiding all unsafe times on the freeways:\n  - Freeway 2 and 3 are unsafe only at turn 46, so safe at later turns.\n  - Freeway 4 and 5 are unsafe at turn 48, so safe at turn 51 (when player is on \\(y = 4\\)) and turn 52 (on \\(y = 5\\)).\n  - Freeway 6 is unsafe at turns 54 and 55, so player is on \\(y = 6\\) at turn 53 (safe).\n  - Freeway 7 is unsafe at turns 46, 47, and 48, so safe at turn 54 (when player is on \\(y = 7\\)).\n  - Freeway 8 is unsafe at turns 62 to 65, so safe at turn 55 (on \\(y = 8\\)).\n- The action at turn 56 (S) is included to complete the sequence for \\(H = 11\\), but it does not affect the position since the player is already at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}_{t=46}^{56}\\) is:\n\n```\nTurn 46: S\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: S\n```\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 56 with no collisions, and \\(H = 11\\) is minimal because:\n- Reaching by turn 55 (with \\(H = 10\\)) would require being on \\(y = 1\\) at turn 47, which is unsafe.\n- Any delay beyond the initial wait increases \\(H\\), so 11 is the minimum.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 46: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 47: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 48: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 50: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 51: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 52: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 53: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 54: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 55: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 56: S \\end{array} }",

The goal is to reach (0, 9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y_T where y_T is between 1 and 8, and at that exact turn, for some car on that freeway, 0 is within the car's span. The car spans move over time based on their direction and speed.\n\nImportant note: when you move to a new y, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So if at turn T you move to y_{T+1}, you are still on y_T at turn T, and you arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1. Therefore, you only check for collision on the freeway you're currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nNow, let's list the car states for each freeway at turn t_1 = 47.\n\nFreeway 1: one car with head h=0, tail τ=-47, direction right, speed s=48. Since it's right-moving, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-47 + 48(T-47), 0 + 48(T-47)]\n\nAt T=47, span is [-47 + 48(0), 0 + 48(0)] = [-47, 0]\n\nBut we need to see when 0 is in the span for collision.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nI need to find for each freeway and each turn, whether there is a car where 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, and cars move horizontally, the collision depends on the horizontal position, but the player is always at x=0, so we care when the car's span includes x=0.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find for which turns T, if the player is on that freeway, there is a collision.\n\nThen, I need to find a path from y=0 to y=9 in min turns, avoiding being on a freeway when it has a car covering x=0 at that turn.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars there, only freeways 1-8 have cars.\n\ny=0 is the start, y=9 is the goal, both are not freeways, so no collision possible there.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to y=8.\n\nSo for y from 1 to 8, each has cars that might cover x=0 at certain times.\n\nI need to compute for each freeway, the times when x=0 is covered by a car.\n\nThen, for the player's path, when moving from y to y+1 or whatever, at each turn, when on a freeway, it must not be a time when that freeway has a collision at x=0.\n\nNow, let's compute the collision times for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway k=1:\n\nCar: head h=0, tail τ=-47, direction right, speed s=48.\n\nRight-moving, so span at T: [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-47 + 48(T-47), 0 + 48(T-47)]\n\nSimplify: let δT = T - 47, so for δT ≥ 0.\n\nSpan: [-47 + 48 δT, 48 δT]\n\nx=0 is in span if -47 + 48 δT ≤ 0 ≤ 48 δT\n\nWhich is 48 δT ≤ 0? No:\n\n-47 + 48 δT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 48 δT\n\nFirst inequality: -47 + 48 δT ≤ 0 => 48 δT ≤ 47 => δT ≤ 47/48 ≈ 0.979\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 48 δT => δT ≥ 0\n\nBut δT is integer since turns are discrete, I assume T is integer.\n\nT is turn number, so δT integer ≥0.\n\nSo for δT=0: span [-47, 0], so -47 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, true, 0 is included.\n\nFor δT=1: span [-47 +48, 48] = [1,48], 0 not in [1,48]\n\nSimilarly, for δT=0 only, since δT=0: 0 ≤ 0 and -47 ≤0, true.\n\nδT=0: -47 +0 = -47 ≤0, and 0 ≤0, yes.\n\nδT=1: -47+48=1 ≤0? 1≤0 false, so not.\n\nSo only at T=47, for freeway 1, x=0 is covered.\n\nBut T=47 is the current turn, and player is at y=0, not on freeway 1, so at T=47, player is on y=0, safe.\n\nFor future turns, no collision on freeway 1, since only T=47 has it.\n\nδT=0 is only once.\n\nSo for k=1, collision only at T=47.\n\nBut since player is not on it then, it's fine. For t>47, no collision on freeway 1.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (60, 49, right, 12)\n\nHead h=60, tail τ=49? Direction right, but for right-moving, if head is larger, tail smaller? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nRight-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 2: (60, 49, right, 12) and (12, 1, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: h=60, τ=49, d=right, s=12.\n\nSince right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h] = [49,60]? But τ=49, h=60, so if right-moving, head should be on the right, so [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,12), so τ=1, h=12.\n\nNow at T, for first car: span [49 + 12(δT), 60 + 12(δT)] where δT = T-47\n\nSimilarly, second car: [1 + 12(δT), 12 + 12(δT)]\n\nx=0 in span for first car: 49 + 12δT ≤ 0 ≤ 60 + 12δT\n\n49 +12δT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 60 +12δT\n\nFirst: 49 +12δT ≤0 => 12δT ≤ -49 => δT ≤ -49/12 ≈ -4.083, impossible since δT ≥0\n\nSecond inequality 0 ≤ 60+12δT always true for δT≥0.\n\nSo never for first car.\n\nNow second car: x=0 in [1+12δT, 12+12δT]\n\nSo 1+12δT ≤ 0 ≤ 12+12δT\n\nLeft: 1+12δT ≤0 => 12δT ≤ -1 => δT ≤ -1/12, impossible\n\nRight: 0 ≤ 12+12δT always true.\n\nSo no collision possible from second car either.\n\nFor freeway 2, no car ever has x=0 in span for T≥47.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12)\n\nIdentical to freeway 2.\n\nSo also no collision.\n\nFreeway 4: (12,47,left,36)\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, span at t1: [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nHere, head h=12, tail τ=47? Notation: \" (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s) \"\n\nFor left-moving, head is on left, tail on right? When moving left, the head is the left end, I think.\n\nIn the update rule:\n\nLeft-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd it says \"head h, tail τ\", so for left-moving, h is the head (left), τ is tail (right).\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, head is right, tail is left.\n\nIn freeway 4: (12,47,left,36), so h=12, τ=47, d=left, s=36.\n\nAt t1, span [12,47]\n\nAt T, [12 - 36(δT), 47 - 36(δT)] with δT = T-47\n\nx=0 in span if 12 - 36δT ≤ 0 ≤ 47 - 36δT\n\nLeft: 12 - 36δT ≤ 0 => -36δT ≤ -12 => 36δT ≥ 12 => δT ≥ 12/36 = 1/3 ≈0.333\n\nRight: 0 ≤ 47 - 36δT => 36δT ≤ 47 => δT ≤ 47/36 ≈ 1.305\n\nSince δT integer, δT =1 satisfies both: 1/3 ≤1≤1.305? 1>0.333 and 1<1.305, yes.\n\nδT=1: 36*1=36, 12-36=-24 ≤0, 47-36=11≥0, so -24 ≤0≤11, yes.\n\nδT=0: 12 -0 =12 ≤0? 12≤0 false.\n\nδT=2: 12-72=-60 ≤0 true, but 0 ≤47-72? 47-72=-25≤0 false, 0≤-25 false.\n\nSo only for δT=1, i.e., T=47+1=48.\n\nSo at T=48, x=0 covered on freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4? (12,47,left,36) identical, so also only at T=48 collision.\n\nFreeway 6: (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nDirection right, so head h=-42, tail τ=-53? Since right-moving, span at t1 [τ, h] = [-53, -42]\n\nAt T, [-53 + 6(δT), -42 + 6(δT)]\n\nx=0 in span if -53 +6δT ≤ 0 ≤ -42 +6δT\n\nLeft: -53 +6δT ≤0 => 6δT ≤53 => δT ≤53/6≈8.833\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -42 +6δT => 42 ≤6δT => δT ≥42/6=7\n\nSo δT from 7 to 8 inclusive, since integer.\n\nδT≥7 and δT≤8.833, so δT=7,8\n\nT=47+7=54 and T=55\n\nδT=7: -53 +42= -11 ≤0, -42+42=0≤0, so -11≤0≤0, yes 0 included.\n\nδT=8: -53+48= -5 ≤0, -42+48=6≥0, -5≤0≤6 yes.\n\nδT=9: -53+54=1≤0? false, and -42+54=12≥0, but 1≤0 false.\n\nSo T=54 and 55.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (52,41,right,4) and (4,-7,right,4)\n\nFirst car: h=52, τ=41, d=right, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [41 +4δT, 52 +4δT]\n\nx=0 in [41+4δT, 52+4δT]? 41+4δT ≤0 ≤52+4δT\n\n41+4δT ≤0? 4δT ≤ -41, impossible since δT≥0\n\n0≤52+4δT always true, so never.\n\nSecond car: (4,-7,right,4) h=4, τ=-7, d=right, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [-7 +4δT, 4 +4δT]\n\nx=0 in [-7+4δT, 4+4δT] if -7+4δT ≤0 ≤4+4δT\n\nLeft: -7+4δT ≤0 => 4δT ≤7 => δT ≤7/4=1.75\n\nRight: 0 ≤4+4δT always true for δT≥0\n\nSo δT=0,1\n\nδT=0: -7+0= -7 ≤0, 4+0=4≥0, yes\n\nδT=1: -7+4= -3≤0, 4+4=8≥0, yes\n\nδT=2: -7+8=1≤0? false\n\nSo for second car, at δT=0 and 1, T=47 and 48.\n\nBut freeway 7 has two cars, so collision if either has x=0 covered.\n\nFirst car never, second car at T=47 and 48.\n\nSo for freeway 7, collision at T=47 and T=48.\n\nNow freeway 8: (-45,-56,right,3)\n\nh=-45, τ=-56, d=right, s=3\n\nSpan at T: [-56 +3δT, -45 +3δT]\n\nx=0 in [-56+3δT, -45+3δT] if -56+3δT ≤0 ≤ -45+3δT\n\nLeft: -56+3δT ≤0 => 3δT ≤56 => δT ≤56/3≈18.666\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -45+3δT => 45 ≤3δT => δT ≥15\n\nSo δT from 15 to 18 inclusive? δT≥15 and δT≤18.666, so δT=15,16,17,18\n\nT=47+15=62, 63,64,65\n\nNow summarize collision times for each freeway:\n\nk=1: collision only at T=47\n\nk=2: no collision\n\nk=3: no collision\n\nk=4: collision at T=48\n\nk=5: collision at T=48 (same as k=4)\n\nk=6: collision at T=54 and 55\n\nk=7: collision at T=47 and 48\n\nk=8: collision at T=62,63,64,65\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at T=47.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, we need to go through freeways 1 to 8.\n\nMinimal turns: since we need to go from y=0 to y=9, the shortest path is 9 moves up, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, D decreases, S stays.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=0, min H is 9 if we go up every turn, but we might be forced to stay or move down if collision.\n\nH is the number of turns including the starting turn? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so at turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAt t=0, position is (0, y_{t1}), so at turn t1, y is given.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t1 + H -1, y should be 9? Let's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1 such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter action a_{t1+H-1}, position at time t1+H.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t after action a_t.\n\nSo at time t, we take action a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAt initial time t1, position is given as (0, y_{t1}) = (0,0)\n\nWe take action a_{t1}, then y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy\n\nThen at time t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1 +1} = y_{t1 + H} =9? No.\n\nAfter H actions, from t1 to t1+H-1, the position after the last action is at time t1 + H.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9? Let's parse the indices.\n\nThe sequence of actions is applied starting from turn t1.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, we go to time t1+1 with y_{t1+1}\n\nAfter action a_{t1+1}, to time t1+2 with y_{t1+2}, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, we are at time t1+k with y_{t1+k}\n\nWe want that at some turn, y=9.\n\nSpecifically, \"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is the position at time t1 + H -1.\n\nTime t1 + H -1 is when we have just taken action a_{t1 + H -2}? Let's index carefully.\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nTake action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo the state at time t is before action a_t.\n\nIn the sequence, for t from 0 to H-1, we have actions a_{t1 + t}\n\nSo for t=0, action a_{t1}, applied at time t1, resulting in y_{t1+1}\n\nFor t=1, action a_{t1+1}, applied at time t1+1, resulting in y_{t1+2}\n\n...\n\nFor t=H-1, action a_{t1 + H -1}, applied at time t1 + H -1, resulting in y_{t1 + H}\n\nNow, we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9? But y_{t1 + H -1} is the position at time t1 + H -1, before the action a_{t1 + H -1} is taken.\n\nAfter taking a_{t1 + H -1}, we go to y_{t1 + H}\n\nBut the condition is y_{t1 + H -1} =9, meaning that at time t1 + H -1, before taking the action, we are already at y=9.\n\nThen we might take an action, but since we are at (0,9), we can just stay or whatever, but the goal is reached when y=9.\n\nThe minimal H such that we are at y=9 at some turn between t1 and t1 + H -1? No.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9 means at time t1 + H -1, we are at y=9.\n\nFor that to happen, the actions up to a_{t1 + H -2} have been taken, bringing us to y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThen at time t1 + H -1, we are at y=9, and we take a_{t1 + H -1}, but since we are already at goal, it doesn't matter.\n\nIn terms of turns, H is the number of actions in the sequence.\n\nSince we start at time t1 at y=0, and we want to be at y=9 at time T for some T.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=9 is the time when we arrive.\n\nFor example, if we go up every turn, at time t1, y=0; after a_t1=U, at time t1+1, y=1; ... after a_{t1+8}=U, at time t1+9, y=9. So at time t1+9, y=9.\n\nThen y_{t1+9} =9.\n\nIn this case, we need actions from t1 to t1+8, so t from 0 to 8, H=9 actions? t from 0 to H-1, so for H=9, t=0 to 8, actions a_{t1} to a_{t1+8}, and y_{t1+9} =9.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet t1 + H -1 = t1+9, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nInconsistency.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the fast case: after 9 actions, y_{t1+9} =9, so t1 + H -1 = t1+9, thus H-1=9, H=10.\n\nBut with H=10 actions, from a_{t1} to a_{t1+9}, but y_{t1+10} might be set, but we don't care.\n\nSince we reach at time t1+9 with y=9, and y_{t1+9} =9, so t1 + H -1 = t1+9, thus H-1=9, H=10.\n\nBut we only need 9 up actions to go from 0 to 9, but with actions, we take 9 actions to increase y 9 times.\n\nStart at time t1, y_t1=0.\n\nTake a_t1=U, go to time t1+1, y=1\n\n...\n\nTake a_{t1+8}=U, go to time t1+9, y=9\n\nSo at time t1+9, y=9.\n\nWe have taken 9 actions: from a_{t1} to a_{t1+8}\n\nThe sequence has H actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}\n\nWhen we take a_{t1+k} for k=0 to H-1, after that we are at time t1+H.\n\nWe want that at some point y=9, specifically y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is at time t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if we want y_{t1+9} =9, then t1 + H -1 = t1+9, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen with H=10, y_{t1+9} =9, which is achieved after 9 actions, but with H=10, we have one extra action.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that y_{t1 + H -1} =9 means that after H-1 actions, we are at y=9 at time t1 + H -1.\n\nThen we take the H-th action a_{t1 + H -1}, but since we are already at goal, it can be S or U or D, but y might change, but the position at time t1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nIn the minimal path, we can reach in 9 turns: from time t1 to t1+8 actions, arrive at time t1+9.\n\nBut y_{t1+9} =9, so for y_{t1 + H -1} =9, set t1+9 = t1 + H -1, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nSo minimal H could be 10 if no obstacles.\n\nBut with obstacles, it might be more.\n\nSince we start at y=0 at time t1, and we want to be at y=9 at time t1 + H -1.\n\nThe time to reach is from t1 to T, with y_T =9, and T = t1 + H -1.\n\nThe number of actions is H, which corresponds to the number of turns from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nFor the path, we need to go from y=0 to y=9 in min steps, avoiding being on a freeway when collision occurs.\n\nBack to the collision times.\n\nAt time T, if the player is on freeway k (y=k for k=1 to 8), and T is a collision time for that k, then collision.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nCollision times:\n\n- For k=1: only T=47\n\n- k=2: never\n\n- k=3: never\n\n- k=4: T=48\n\n- k=5: T=48\n\n- k=6: T=54,55\n\n- k=7: T=47,48\n\n- k=8: T=62,63,64,65\n\nPlayer starts at T=47, y=0, safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some time.\n\nSince k=2 and k=3 have no collision, they are always safe to be on at any time.\n\nk=1 has collision only at T=47, but at T=47, player is at y=0, not on k=1, so for T>47, k=1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, k=4 and k=5 have collision only at T=48, so for other times, safe.\n\nk=6 collision at T=54,55\n\nk=7 collision at T=47 and 48, but T=47 and 48 are early, we start at T=47.\n\nk=8 collision at T=62-65, which is later.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on a freeway at its collision times.\n\nFor example, at T=48, k=4 and k=5 have collision, so if we are on y=4 or y=5 at T=48, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at T=54,55, if on y=6, collision.\n\nEtc.\n\nSince we start at T=47, y=0.\n\nWe can take actions to move up.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=9 is at time T=47+9=56, if we go up every turn from T=47 to T=55.\n\nLet's see the path.\n\nTime T, position y_T.\n\nAt T=47, y=0.\n\nTake action a_{47}, go to y_{48}.\n\nThen at T=48, y_{48}, and so on.\n\nWe want y_T for T from 48 onwards.\n\ny_{47} =0\n\nAfter a_{47}, y_{48} = y_{47} + Δy_{47}\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, collision is checked at each time T when on freeway y_T.\n\nFor example, at time T=48, if y_{48} is between 1 and 8, and it is a collision time for that freeway.\n\nSpecifically, for T=48, k=4 and k=5 have collision, so if y_{48} =4 or 5, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at T=54 and 55, if y_T=6, collision.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nSuppose we go directly up.\n\nStart T=47, y=0.\n\na_{47}: if we go U, then y_{48} =1\n\nBut at T=48, y=1, which is freeway 1.\n\nNow, for k=1, collision only at T=47, not at T=48, so safe.\n\nThen a_{48}: U, y_{49} =2\n\ny=2, freeway 2, no collision ever, safe.\n\na_{49}: U, y_{50} =3, freeway 3, no collision, safe.\n\na_{50}: U, y_{51} =4, freeway 4.\n\nNow at T=51, is there collision on k=4? Collision only at T=48, not at T=51, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_{51}: U, y_{52} =5, freeway 5, collision only at T=48, not T=52, safe.\n\na_{52}: U, y_{53} =6, freeway 6.\n\nNow at T=53, y=6, freeway 6 has collision at T=54 and 55, not at 53, so safe.\n\na_{53}: U, y_{54} =7, freeway 7.\n\nAt T=54, y=7, freeway 7 has collision at T=47 and 48, not at 54, so safe.\n\na_{54}: U, y_{55} =8, freeway 8.\n\nAt T=55, y=8, freeway 8 has collision at T=62-65, not at 55, so safe.\n\na_{55}: U, y_{56} =9, goal reached at time T=56.\n\ny_{56} =9.\n\nNow, we reached at time T=56.\n\nIn terms of H: we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1=47, so y_{47 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet 47 + H -1 =56, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions: from a_{47} to a_{55}, that's 9 actions? a_{47} to a_{55} is t from 47 to 55, that's 9 turns: 47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nHere, a_{47} to a_{47+8} = a_{55} for t=0 to 8, H=9 actions? t=0 to 8, that's 9 values.\n\nt=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 → 9 actions.\n\nThen y_{t1 + H} = y_{47+9} = y_{56} =9.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{47 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet 47 + H -1 =56, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen with H=10, we need y_{47 +10 -1} = y_{56} =9, which is achieved.\n\nBut with the actions above, we have 9 actions to reach y_{56}=9, but for H=10, we need to specify 10 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can add an extra action at the end, but since we are already at y=9, we can do S for the last action.\n\nIn the sequence for H=10, actions from a_{47} to a_{56}? t=0 to 9, a_{t1} to a_{t1+9}.\n\nAfter a_{t1+9}, y_{t1+10}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1+H-1} = y_{t1+9} =9.\n\nSo at time t1+9, we should be at y=9.\n\nIn the path above, at time t1+9 =47+9=56, y=9.\n\nSo we need to be at y=9 at time 56.\n\nWith actions: from time 47 to 55, we take actions to move up, arriving at y=9 at time 56.\n\nAt time 56, y=9, so for y_{t1+H-1} = y_{56} =9, so t1+H-1=56, 47+H-1=56, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThe actions are taken at times t1 to t1+H-1, i.e., 47 to 56? t1+H-1=56, so actions at times 47 to 56? Let's see.\n\nActions: a_t for t = t1 to t1 + H -1\n\nSet t1 + H -1 =56, so actions from t=47 to 56, that's 10 actions: t=47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56.\n\nBut at time t, taking a_t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to have y_{56} =9, we need to have taken actions that bring us to y=9 by time 56.\n\nIn the sequence, if we take U from a_{47} to a_{55}, then:\n\na_{47}: U, y_{48}=1\n\na_{48}: U, y_{49}=2\n\n...\n\na_{54}: U, y_{55}=8? Let's list:\n\nAfter a_{47}: y_{48}=1\n\nAfter a_{48}: y_{49}=2\n\nAfter a_{49}: y_{50}=3\n\nAfter a_{50}: y_{51}=4\n\nAfter a_{51}: y_{52}=5\n\nAfter a_{52}: y_{53}=6\n\nAfter a_{53}: y_{54}=7\n\nAfter a_{54}: U, y_{55}=8\n\nAfter a_{55}: U, y_{56}=9\n\nSo at time 56, y=9.\n\nTo have y_{56} =9, which is after 9 actions: a_{47} to a_{55}.\n\nBut for the sequence with H actions, a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, to have y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nIn this case, y_{56} =9, so t1+H-1=56, 47+H-1=56, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen the actions must include a_{t1} to a_{t1+9} = a_{47} to a_{56}.\n\nBut a_{56} is at time 56, which affects y_{57}, but we don't care about y_{57}.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=10, we need actions at t=47 to 56.\n\nBut with the above, we have actions up to a_{55} for y_{56}=9.\n\nFor a_{56}, since we are at y_{56}=9, we can set a_{56}=S, so y_{57}=9, but it doesn't matter.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence, we can have a_{47} to a_{55} as U, and a_{56} as S or U or D, but since y=9, D would go to 8, but the position at time 56 is 9, which is what we want.\n\ny_{t1+H-1} = y_{56} =9, so at time 56, we are at y=9, regardless of what action we take at time 56.\n\nSo for the minimal path, we can reach at time 56 with 9 up actions, but to satisfy H, we set H=10 with an extra action.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier.\n\nCan we reach y=9 before time 56?\n\nAt time 47, y=0.\n\nAfter one action, at time 48, y=1 max.\n\nAfter two actions, time 49, y=2 max, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, y <= y_{47} + k = k, since start at 0.\n\nTo reach y=9, need at least 9 actions, so earliest at time 47+9=56 with y_{56}=9.\n\nCannot earlier.\n\nIn the path above, we didn't have any collision because we avoided the collision times.\n\nFor example, at T=48, we were at y=1 (freeway 1), but collision only at T=47, not 48, so safe.\n\nAt T=48, freeway 4 and 5 have collision, but we were at y=1, not 4 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, at T=54 and 55, we were at y=7 and 8, not 6.\n\nAnd freeway 7 at T=54, no collision, etc.\n\nSo it seems we can reach in 9 actions, but H=10 for the sequence.\n\nBut in the path, we used 9 actions: a_{47} to a_{55} all U.\n\nFor H=10, we need to output 10 actions, so we can add a_{56}=S, for example.\n\nBut let's confirm if at any point we had collision.\n\nAt T=47, y=0, not freeway.\n\nAt T=48, y=1, freeway 1, collision times: only T=47, not T=48, so no collision.\n\nAt T=49, y=2, freeway 2, no collision ever.\n\nT=50, y=3, freeway 3, no collision.\n\nT=51, y=4, freeway 4, collision only at T=48, not 51, safe.\n\nT=52, y=5, freeway 5, collision only at T=48, not 52, safe.\n\nT=53, y=6, freeway 6, collision at T=54 and 55, not 53, safe.\n\nT=54, y=7, freeway 7, collision at T=47 and 48, not 54, safe.\n\nT=55, y=8, freeway 8, collision at T=62-65, not 55, safe.\n\nT=56, y=9, goal.\n\nAll safe.\n\nSo we can reach at time 56.\n\nNow for the sequence with H=10.\n\nWe need actions from t=47 to 56, 10 actions.\n\nActions a_{47} to a_{55} as U, and a_{56} as S (or whatever).\n\nBut a_{56} is at time 56, and y_{56}=9, so we take action at time 56, but it doesn't affect the position at time 56.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output the actions for the sequence.\n\nPerhaps H=10 is minimal since we need at least 9 actions to increase y, and with H=10, we reach at time 56.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier? No, because min 9 actions to go up 9 steps.\n\nEach action can increase y by at most 1, so from 0 to 9, min 9 actions required, arriving at time 47+9=56.\n\nSo minimal H is 10, since H-1=9, H=10.\n\nWith H=10 actions, we can have the sequence as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, for t from 0 to H-1, a_{t1 + t}\n\nt1=47.\n\nSo for t=0: a_{47} = U\n\nt=1: a_{48} = U\n\n...\n\nup to t=8: a_{55} = U\n\nThen for t=9: a_{56} = S (since we are at y=9)\n\nNow, the position: after a_{55}, y_{56}=9.\n\nAt time 56, we are at y=9, so y_{56}=9.\n\nThen a_{56} is taken, but y_{57} might change, but we don't care.\n\nIn the output, we need to list the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have a_{47} to a_{56}, but a_{56} might not be necessary, but to have H=10, we include it.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at an earlier time, but we cannot.\n\nAnother thing: we might go faster by going down or something, but that would take more turns, not fewer.\n\nFor example, if we go down, y decreases, then we need more actions to come back, so H larger.\n\nSo min H=10.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision for freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 has collision at T=47 and 48.\n\nIn our path, at T=54, we are on y=7, which is freeway 7, but at T=54, no collision for k=7, since collision only at 47 and 48.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut in the beginning, at T=48, we are at y=1, freeway 1, which is safe at T=48.\n\nBut is there any other constraint?\n\nFreeway 6 has collision at T=54 and 55.\n\nIn our path, at T=53, y=6, which is before collision, safe.\n\nAt T=54, y=7, not 6.\n\nSo avoided.\n\nSimilarly, k=8 collision late.\n\nSo the path seems fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=10.\n\nSequence: a_{47} = U, a_{48} = U, a_{49} = U, a_{50} = U, a_{51} = U, a_{52} = U, a_{53} = U, a_{54} = U, a_{55} = U, and then for a_{56}, since we need H=10, we add a_{56} = S.\n\nBut in the sequence for t=0 to 9, a_{47} to a_{56}.\n\nAfter a_{55}, y_{56}=9.\n\nThen at time 56, we take a_{56}, which can be S, so y_{57}=9, but position at time 56 is 9.\n\nIn the output format, we need to list for each turn.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\"\n\n\"Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\"\n\n...\n\nup to Turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nWith H=10, t_1=47, so turns from 47 to 56.\n\nActions: for turn 47 to 55: U, turn 56: S\n\nBut turn 56 is t_1 + 9 =47+9=56.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =47+10-1=56.\n\nYes.\n\nTo avoid the extra action, but we have to since H=10.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 at an earlier time, but impossible.\n\nAnother thought: if we stay at some point, but that would delay, not help.\n\nOr go down, worse.\n\nSo min H=10.\n\nBut let's check freeway 8 collision at T=62-65, but we are at y=8 at T=55, before that.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut in the car for freeway 6, collision at T=54 and 55.\n\nIn our path, at T=53, y=6, which is safe, then at T=54, y=7, not on 6.\n\nBut if we were on y=6 at T=54, collision.\n\nBut we moved up.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps we can go slower to avoid, but not necessary.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 56, we set S, but it could be U or D, but since y=9, U would go to 10, but y max 9, so if U at y=9, y_{t+1}=min(9,9+1)=9? y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, but y_t in [0,9], and if y_t=9, U: 9+1=10, but y must be <=9, so probably y_{t+1} = min(9, max(0, y_t + Delta)), so at y=9, U or S both go to 9, D goes to 8.\n\nBut in this case, for a_{56}, we can set S to stay at 9.\n\nIn the output, we need to list the actions.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nt1=47\n\nH=10\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: S\n\nIn the sequence, turn t1 + H -1 = turn 56.\n\nAnd y at time 56 is 9.\n\ny_{56} =9.\n\nIn the action for turn 56, we set S, which is fine.\n\nTo be precise, at turn 56, we are at y=9, take S, go to y=9 at next, but position at turn 56 is already 9.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 7, there is a car at T=47 and 48, but we are not on it then.\n\nAnother thing: the note about moving to new y.\n\nIn this case, when we move, for example, at turn T, we are on y_T, take action a_T, if a_T=U, we move to y_{T+1}=y_T+1.\n\nAt turn T, we are on y_T, so collision check on y_T at time T.\n\nAfter action, at time T+1, we are on y_{T+1}, collision check on that.\n\nIn our path, no issue.\n\nBut just to confirm, suppose at some point we need to avoid being on a freeway at collision time.\n\nFor example, if we were to be on y=4 at T=48, collision, but we were at y=1 at T=48.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo I think this works.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, we need to box it.\n\nBut let's see if we can have H smaller? No.\n\nPerhaps with H=9, but H=9 actions: from t=0 to 8, actions a_{47} to a_{55}, then y_{56}=9.\n\nBut y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{47 + 9 -1} = y_{55}.\n\nWith actions a_{47} to a_{54}, we can have y_{55}=8, for example.\n\nAfter a_{47} to a_{54} all U: y_{48}=1, ..., y_{55}=8.\n\nThen at time t1 + H -1 = t1 +9 -1=47+8=55, y_{55}=8 ≠9.\n\nIf we take a_{55}=U, but a_{55} is part of the sequence if H=9, t=0 to 8, a_{47} to a_{55}.\n\nThen after a_{55}, y_{56}=9, but y_{t1+H-1} = y_{47+9-1}=y_{55}=8 ≠9.\n\nSo not reached.\n\nTherefore, with H=9, we cannot reach y=9 at time y_{55}, since max y_{55}=8 if we start from y_{47}=0 with 8 actions.\n\ny_{47}=0, after k actions, y_{47+k} <= k.\n\nSo at time 47+8=55, y_{55} <=8.\n\nTo have y_{55}=9, impossible from y_{47}=0 in 8 steps.\n\nThus minimal H=10.\n\nSo our sequence is fine.\n\nNow, in the sequence, for turn 56, we set S, but since the action doesn't matter, we can set U or S, but S is safer to not move.\n\nBut at y=9, U also stays at 9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, in the output, we need to list for each turn.\n\nBut the turn labels: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nWith t_1=47.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: S\n\nBut turn 56 is t_1 + 9, since 47+9=56.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =47+10-1=56.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can write the actions without the last S, but H must be min and we need to satisfy the condition.\n\nAnother thing: in the car for freeway 6, collision at T=54 and 55, but we are not on it.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's list the position at each time.\n\nTime T | y_T | freeway | collision?\n\nT=47: y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nT=48: y=1, k=1, collision times: only T=47, not 48, safe.\n\nT=49: y=2, k=2, no collision ever, safe.\n\nT=50: y=3, k=3, no collision, safe.\n\nT=51: y=4, k=4, collision only T=48, not 51, safe.\n\nT=52: y=5, k=5, collision only T=48, not 52, safe.\n\nT=53: y=6, k=6, collision at T=54,55, not 53, safe.\n\nT=54: y=7, k=7, collision at T=47,48, not 54, safe.\n\nT=55: y=8, k=8, collision at T=62-65, not 55, safe.\n\nT=56: y=9, goal.\n\nAll good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U from turn 47 to 55, and S at turn 56.\n\nIn the action sequence for H=10, turns 47 to 56.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut in the output, it should be in the box.\n\nAlso, the player position is given as (0,0), and we reach (0,9).\n\nNow, I think that's it.\n\nBut let's check freeway 7 again.\n\nFreeway 7 has two cars, but we saw only the second one causes collision at T=47,48.\n\nAt T=54, no issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 47\\) is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a freeway during its collision times. The collision times for each freeway are as follows:\n\n- Freeway 1: Collision only at \\(T = 47\\) (safe for \\(T > 47\\)).\n- Freeway 2: No collision at any time.\n- Freeway 3: No collision at any time.\n- Freeway 4: Collision at \\(T = 48\\) (safe for \\(T \\neq 48\\)).\n- Freeway 5: Collision at \\(T = 48\\) (safe for \\(T \\neq 48\\)).\n- Freeway 6: Collision at \\(T = 54\\) and \\(T = 55\\) (safe for \\(T \\neq 54, 55\\)).\n- Freeway 7: Collision at \\(T = 47\\) and \\(T = 48\\) (safe for \\(T \\neq 47, 48\\)).\n- Freeway 8: Collision at \\(T = 62, 63, 64, 65\\) (safe for \\(T < 62\\) or \\(T > 65\\)).\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) at \\(T = 47\\). The optimal path moves up every turn from turn 47 to turn 55, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at time \\(T = 56\\). At turn 56, since the player is already at \\(y = 9\\), the action is \"S\" (stay) to remain at the goal, though any action would be acceptable as the position at \\(T = 56\\) is \\((0, 9)\\). The sequence of actions for turns 47 to 56 achieves \\(y_{56} = 9\\), and with \\(H = 10\\), \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{56} = 9\\).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- Turn 47: Move up (U) to \\(y_{48} = 1\\) (freeway 1, safe as no collision at \\(T = 48\\)).\n- Turn 48: Move up (U) to \\(y_{49} = 2\\) (freeway 2, no collision).\n- Turn 49: Move up (U) to \\(y_{50} = 3\\) (freeway 3, no collision).\n- Turn 50: Move up (U) to \\(y_{51} = 4\\) (freeway 4, safe as no collision at \\(T = 51\\)).\n- Turn 51: Move up (U) to \\(y_{52} = 5\\) (freeway 5, safe as no collision at \\(T = 52\\)).\n- Turn 52: Move up (U) to \\(y_{53} = 6\\) (freeway 6, safe as no collision at \\(T = 53\\)).\n- Turn 53: Move up (U) to \\(y_{54} = 7\\) (freeway 7, safe as no collision at \\(T = 54\\)).\n- Turn 54: Move up (U) to \\(y_{55} = 8\\) (freeway 8, safe as no collision at \\(T = 55\\)).\n- Turn 55: Move up (U) to \\(y_{56} = 9\\) (goal reached).\n- Turn 56: Stay (S) at \\(y_{57} = 9\\) (action at goal, position at \\(T = 56\\) is \\((0, 9)\\)).\n\nThis sequence minimizes \\(H = 10\\) and avoids all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 47: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 48: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 50: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 51: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 52: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 53: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 54: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 55: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 56: S \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 1) at turn t_1 = 48. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. I need to find a sequence of actions: U (up), D (down), or S (stay), that moves the player vertically.\n\nThe player's y-position changes based on the action: U increases y by 1, D decreases by 1, S keeps it the same, but y must stay between 0 and 9. Since we start at y=1 and want to go to y=9, we'll mostly be moving up, but might need to stay or move down to avoid cars.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8), and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span is the positions it occupies, and it moves left or right based on direction and speed.\n\nImportant note: when you move to a new y, you are not on that y until the next turn. So if at turn T you are on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1}, you are not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1. So for collision at turn T, it only cares about the car on y_T at that turn, and whether 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t_1=48, and for future turns, we compute based on the movement.\n\nLet me list out all the cars for each freeway at turn t_1=48.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head=48, tail=1, direction=right, speed=48\n\nSince direction is right, head and tail: it says (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, head is the front, so higher x, tail is lower x. In the span, for right-moving, span is [tail, head] or [head, tail]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving at t_1, span is [τ, h], meaning from τ to h, with τ < h since it's moving right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h > τ? In the left-moving case, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and then [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if it's moving left, decreasing x, so h should be the higher end, τ lower.\n\nBut in the notation, for left-moving, it's written as (h, τ, left, s), so h is head, which for left-moving should be the leftmost or rightmost? I need to clarify.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\n\nSo if it's moving left, x decreasing, so at T, positions are lower, so h and τ are both decreasing. But the span [h, τ] at t_1, and since it's moving left, h should be the right end (higher x), and τ the left end (lower x)? But in the span notation, [a,b] usually a <= b.\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], which for right-moving, τ is tail, h is head, so τ <= h, and [τ, h] means from τ to h.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], but if it's moving left, and [h, τ], with h and τ, which is min and max?\n\nIn left-moving, it says [h, τ], and then both decrease, so if h and τ, which one is larger?\n\nFor example, in freeway 4 and 5, we have (-24, 11, left, 36). So h = -24, τ = 11, direction left, speed 36.\n\nAt t_1=48, span is [h, τ] = [-24, 11]. But -24 to 11, that's from left to right? But direction is left, meaning moving to decreasing x.\n\nIn the span [h, τ] = [-24, 11], but -24 < 11, so [ -24, 11] is from x=-24 to x=11.\n\nBut if direction is left, moving to negative x, so at later time, both ends decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like freeway 1: (48, 1, right, 48), so τ=1, h=48, span [τ, h] = [1,48] at t_1.\n\nNow, collision condition: at turn T, for the freeway y_T, if there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\n0 is the x-position where the player is, always x=0, I assume.\n\nPlayer is at (0, y_t), so x=0 always, y changes.\n\nSo for a car on freeway k, at turn T, we need to check if 0 is in [min_span, max_span] of the car at that turn.\n\nFor each car, given its parameters, we can find for which turns the car occupies x=0 on its freeway.\n\nBut since multiple cars per freeway, we need to check all cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAlso, the player is only at risk when on freeways y=1 to 8; at y=0 and y=9, no cars, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nThe problem says \"freeways y=1,...,8\" and \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways\", and player at y=0 or y=9 should be safe.\n\nNow, we start at y=1, which is a freeway, so we need to check collision at turn t_1 if we stay or move.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars and their positions over time relative to t_1.\n\nSet t_1 = 48.\n\nFor a future turn T, let Δt = T - t_1, so at turn T, for each car, we can compute its span.\n\nThen for a given freeway and turn, if player is on that freeway, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at that turn, collision.\n\nBut note that if the player moves to a different y, at turn T, when action is taken, after action, y_{T+1} is set, but for collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, the player is at position (0, y_T), and we check if on freeway y_T (1-8), and if cars on y_T have 0 in span at T.\n\nThen after action, y_{T+1} is determined, and so on.\n\nNow, for the starting point, at turn t_1=48, player is at (0,1), freeway y=1.\n\nFreeway 1 has one car: at t_1, span [τ, h] = [1,48] for right-moving, since (τ=1, h=48, right, s=48)\n\n[τ, h] = [1,48], so at t_1, x from 1 to 48.\n\nIs 0 in [1,48]? 0 < 1, so not in, so no collision at t_1 if we are there.\n\nBut player is at y=1, x=0, and car span is [1,48], so x=0 is not occupied, so safe.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H: since we start at y=1, need to go to y=9, each U move increases y by 1, so minimum 8 moves if we go up every turn, but we might need to wait or move down to avoid cars, so H could be more.\n\nBut we need to find minimal H with no collision.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, for which turns the cars occupy x=0.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, we need the times when for a given freeway, at least one car has 0 in span.\n\nBut for planning, we need to know when it's safe to be on each freeway.\n\nDefine for each freeway k, the set of turns T where if player is on k at T, collision occurs, i.e., 0 is occupied by some car on k at T.\n\nThen, for turns when no car occupies 0, it's safe to be on that freeway.\n\nBut we need to consider the movement between freeways.\n\nSince the player moves vertically only, and we need to go from y=1 to y=9, we can think of the grid over time.\n\nBut time is discrete turns.\n\nList all freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=48, τ=1, d=right, s=48) but for right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [1,48]\n\nAt time T, span = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [1 + 48Δt, 48 + 48Δt] where Δt = T - t_1\n\n0 in span if 1 + 48Δt <= 0 <= 48 + 48Δt\n\nBut 1 + 48Δt <= 0 implies 48Δt <= -1, Δt <= -1/48, not possible since Δt >=0\n\n0 <= 48 + 48Δt always true since Δt >=0\n\nBut 0 >= 1 + 48Δt? 0 >= 1 + 48Δt implies 48Δt <= -1, impossible.\n\nSo for all Δt >=0, 1 + 48Δt >=1 >0, so 0 < min_span, so 0 never in [1+48Δt, 48+48Δt] for Δt>=0.\n\nThus on freeway 1, at no future time is 0 occupied. At t_1 it's not occupied, and as time increases, the car moves right, so span moves to higher x, so x=0 is always left of the car, never occupied.\n\nSo freeway 1 is always safe? But at t_1, span [1,48], so x=0 not occupied, and later min_x increases, so yes, freeway 1 has no car at x=0 for any T >= t_1.\n\nBut there might be other cars, but freeway 1 has only one car, so yes, freeway 1 is always safe to be on.\n\nNow freeway 2: has two cars: first (-48, -59, right, 12), second (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nFirst, for right-moving cars.\n\nFirst car: (τ, h, d, s) = (-48, -59, right, 12)? But τ and h, for right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h]\n\nBut τ = -48, h = -59? -48 and -59, if τ = -48, h = -59, but -48 > -59, so [τ, h] = [-48, -59]? That would be from -48 to -59, which is decreasing, but usually span should be min to max.\n\nI think there might be a inconsistency in notation.\n\nLet's read the input: for freeway 2: \"(-48, -59, right, 12), (24, 13, right, 12)\"\n\nNow, for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\n\nBut for first car, τ = -48, h = -59? -48 and -59, -48 > -59, so if [τ, h] = [-48, -59], that means positions from -59 to -48? No, [a,b] with a<=b, but here τ and h, if τ = -48, h = -59, then τ > h, which might be wrong.\n\nPerhaps I misread the tuple.\n\nThe car state is given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nIn the table: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 2: first car: head h = -48, tail τ = -59, direction right, speed 12\n\nSecond car: head h=24, tail τ=13, direction right, speed 12\n\nFor a right-moving car, head is the front, so higher x, tail is lower x.\n\nFor first car, head h=-48, tail τ=-59, since -48 > -59, so head at -48, tail at -59, so span from τ to h, min τ to max h, so [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? But the update rule says for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], which should be the interval.\n\nAt t_1, for first car, τ = -59, h = -48? The input says \"(-48, -59, ...)\" so head=-48, tail=-59.\n\nSince head > tail for right-moving, so min is tail, max is head, so span at t_1 is [tail, head] = [-59, -48]\n\nSimilarly, for second car, head=24, tail=13, both positive, span [13,24]\n\nIn the update rule, it says for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt]\n\nSo for first car, τ = -59, h = -48, s=12\n\nAt T, span [ -59 + 12Δt, -48 + 12Δt ]\n\nSimilarly for second car, τ=13, h=24, s=12, span [13 + 12Δt, 24 + 12Δt]\n\nNow, 0 in span for freeway 2 at T if for first car: -59 +12Δt <= 0 <= -48 +12Δt\n\nOr for second car: 13 +12Δt <= 0 <= 24 +12Δt\n\nFirst, for second car: 13 +12Δt <=0? 13+12Δt >=13>0 for Δt>=0, so min is at least 13>0, so 0 < min, not in span. Similarly, upper bound larger, but since min>0, 0 not in [13+12Δt,24+12Δt] for any Δt>=0.\n\nFor first car: -59 +12Δt <= 0 <= -48 +12Δt\n\nLeft: -59 +12Δt <= 0 implies 12Δt <= 59, Δt <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so Δt <=4 since integer? Δt is integer, turns are discrete.\n\nT and t_1 are integers, I assume, since turns.\n\nIn the game, turns are discrete, so Δt integer.\n\nSo -59 +12Δt <= 0 when 12Δt <=59, Δt <= floor(59/12)=4 since 12*4=48<59, 12*5=60>59? 12Δt <=59, Δt <=4 because 12*4=48 <=59, 12*5=60>59.\n\nΔt <= floor(59/12) =4? 12*4=48, -59+48= -11 <=0 true.\n\n12*5=60, -59+60=1>0, false.\n\nSo -59+12Δt <=0 for Δt <=4\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -48 +12Δt implies -48 +12Δt >=0, 12Δt >=48, Δt >=4\n\nSo for first car, 0 in span when both: -59+12Δt <=0 and 0 <= -48+12Δt, which is Δt <=4 and Δt >=4, so Δt=4.\n\nAt Δt=4, T = t_1 +4 =52, span [ -59+12*4, -48+12*4] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0]\n\n0 is in [-11,0], yes, since -11 <=0<=0.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nFor second car, as above, never.\n\nSo on freeway 2, only at T=52, there is a car at x=0, so collision if player on y=2 at turn 52.\n\nOther times, safe.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"(-48, -59, right, 12), (24, 13, right, 12)\" identical to freeway 2.\n\nSo same thing, only at T=52, collision on y=3 if on it.\n\nNow freeway 4: \"(-24, 11, left, 36)\"\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]\n\nHere h = -24, τ =11, s=36\n\nSpan at t_1: [h, τ] = [-24, 11], but -24 to 11, and since moving left, both decrease.\n\nAt T, span [ -24 -36Δt, 11 -36Δt ]\n\n0 in span if min <=0<=max.\n\nMin is -24-36Δt, max is 11-36Δt.\n\nSince moving left, min and max decreasing.\n\n-24-36Δt <= 0 <= 11-36Δt\n\nLeft: -24-36Δt <=0 always true for Δt>=0.\n\nRight: 0 <= 11-36Δt implies 11-36Δt >=0, 36Δt <=11, Δt <= 11/36 ≈0.305, so for Δt=0 only? Since Δt integer >=0.\n\nΔt=0: 11-0=11>=0, true.\n\nΔt=1: 11-36= -25 <0, false.\n\nSo 0 <= 11-36Δt only for Δt=0.\n\nBut we need both inequalities.\n\n-24-36Δt <=0 always true for Δt>=0.\n\n0 <= 11-36Δt only for Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt=0, min=-24, max=11, 0 in [-24,11], yes.\n\nFor Δt>=1, 0 <=11-36Δt false, since 11-36Δt <=11-36<0 for Δt>=1, so max <0, 0 not in span.\n\nThus, only at Δt=0, T=t_1=48, 0 is in span for freeway 4.\n\nAt T=48, span [-24,11], 0 is between -24 and 11, so occupied.\n\nBut at that turn, if player is on y=4, collision.\n\nFor later turns, not occupied.\n\nNow freeway 5: same as freeway 4? \"(-24, 11, left, 36)\" identical, so same, only at T=48, occupied on y=5.\n\nNow freeway 6: \"(-36, -47, right, 6)\"\n\nDirection right, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] with τ and h.\n\nHead h=-36, tail τ=-47? Since head > tail, τ=-47, h=-36.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt T: [ -47 +6Δt, -36 +6Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -47+6Δt <=0 <= -36+6Δt\n\nLeft: -47+6Δt <=0 implies 6Δt <=47, Δt <= floor(47/6)=7 since 6*7=42<47, 6*8=48>47? 6Δt <=47, Δt<=7 because 6*7=42<=47, -47+42=-5<=0 true; 6*8=48>47, -47+48=1>0 false? -47+6Δt <=0 for Δt<=7: at Δt=7, -47+42=-5<=0; Δt=8, -47+48=1>0, not <=0.\n\nRight: 0 <= -36+6Δt implies -36+6Δt >=0, 6Δt >=36, Δt >=6\n\nSo both: Δt <=7 and Δt >=6, so Δt=6 or 7.\n\nAt Δt=6: span [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], 0 in [-11,0]\n\nAt Δt=7: span [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6], 0 in [-5,6]\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nSo for freeway 6, occupied at T=t_1+6=54 and T=t_1+7=55.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars: \"(56, 45, right, 4), (8, -3, right, 4)\"\n\nFirst car: head=56, tail=45, direction right, speed=4\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [45,56]\n\nAt T: [45 +4Δt, 56 +4Δt], min=45+4Δt >=45>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSecond car: head=8, tail=-3, direction right, speed=4\n\nτ=-3, h=8, span at t_1: [-3,8]\n\nAt T: [-3 +4Δt, 8 +4Δt]\n\n0 in span if -3+4Δt <=0 <=8+4Δt\n\nLeft: -3+4Δt <=0 always for Δt>=1?

Let's see the indices.\n\nSet t=0 to t=H-1.\n\nAt t=0: start, y=1\n\nAfter H-1 actions, at turn t=H-1, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, to reach y=9, we need 8 up moves from y=1.\n\nEach move takes one turn.\n\nStart at t=0, y=1.\n\nAfter first U at t=0, y=2 at t=1\n\nAfter second U at t=1, y=3 at t=2\n\n...\n\nAfter k-th U, y=1+k at turn t=k\n\nTo have y=9, need k=8, so at turn t=8, y=9.\n\nAnd we started at t=0.\n\nSo the turns from t=0 to t=8, that's 9 turns: t=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nAt t=8, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, so sequence from t=t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nIn relative, from t=0 to t=H-1, with y_{H-1}=9.\n\nIn this case, y_8=9, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, we did actions from t=0 to t=7 to reach y_8=9.\n\nActions: a_0 to a_7, 8 actions, over 8 steps? Let's list:\n\nTurn relative t | y_t | action a_t | next y\n\nt=0: y=1, a_0=U, y_1=2\n\nt=1: y=2, a_1=U, y_2=3\n\nt=2: y=3, a_2=U, y_3=4\n\nt=3: y=4, a_3=U, y_4=5\n\nt=4: y=5, a_4=U, y_5=6\n\nt=5: y=6, a_5=U, y_6=7\n\nt=6: y=7, a_6=U, y_7=8\n\nt=7: y=8, a_7=U, y_8=9\n\nSo at t=8, y=9, no action needed? But the sequence is actions from t=0 to t=7.\n\nThe player reaches y=9 at turn t=8.\n\nIn terms of the game, at turn t_1 + 8, position (0,9).\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and at the end of that, after last action, y should be 9.\n\nIn this case, actions from t_1 to t_1+7 (relative t=0 to7), and after last action at t_1+7, y_{t_1+8} =9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T, action a_T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nIn the sequence: at turn t_1 + t, we set a_{t_1 + t}, which sets y_{t_1 + t +1} for the next turn.\n\nStart: at turn t_1, position given, y_{t_1} =1.\n\nThen we choose a_{t_1}, which sets y_{t_1 +1}\n\nThen at turn t_1+1, we choose a_{t_1+1}, sets y_{t_1+2}, and so on, up to some turn, we set a_{t_1 + H-1}, and after that, y_{t_1 + H} should be 9? No.\n\nThe player position at turn T is y_T.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, then we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nCollision at turn T depends on y_T.\n\nWe want to reach (0,9), so at some turn, y_T =9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1, meaning a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}, and after all actions, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nAfter choosing a_{t_1 + H-1}, we set y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nSo the position at turn t_1 + H is (0,9).\n\nThe actions are for turns t_1 to t_1 + H-1, inclusive.\n\nIn the sequence, H actions? Turns: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H-1, that's H turns for actions.\n\nAfter that, at turn t_1 + H, position is reached.\n\nIn my earlier sequence, to have y=9, we need to go from y=1 to y=9, which takes 8 steps up, each step at a turn.\n\nStart: turn t_1, y=1, choose a_{t_1}, set y_{t_1+1}\n\nTo set y_{t_1+1} to 2, and so on.\n\nAfter 8 actions, y_{t_1+8} =9.\n\nSo actions from t_1 to t_1+7, 8 actions, H=8? Turns for actions: t_1 to t_1+7, that's 8 turns? t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+7: 8 actions.\n\nThen at turn t_1+8, y=9.\n\nSo H=8, meaning 8 actions, from t_1 to t_1+7.\n\nIn the sequence above relative t=0 to7, actions a_0 to a_7, then y_8=9.\n\nIn the collision check, in my sequence, I assumed all safe, but let's verify each step.\n\nIn the direct up path:\n\nAt turn t_1 + t for t=0 to7.\n\nt relative, turn absolute.\n\nSet turn T = t_1 + t, t from 0.\n\nAt T=48 (t=0): y=1, safe, as before.\n\nAction a_{48} = U, so y_{49} = 2\n\nAt T=49 (t=1): y=2, position on freeway 2.\n\nIs it safe? T=49, Δt=1 from t_1.\n\nFreeway 2: cars, as before, span [-47,-36] and [25,36], no 0, safe.\n\nAction a_{49} = U, y_{50} =3\n\nT=50 (t=2): y=3, freeway 3, similar, at Δt=2, span [-35,-24] and [37,48], no 0, safe.\n\na_{50} = U, y_{51} =4\n\nT=51 (t=3): y=4, freeway 4, at Δt=3, span [-24-108, 11-108]=[-132,-97], no 0, safe.\n\na_{51} = U, y_{52} =5\n\nT=52 (t=4): y=5, freeway 5, at Δt=4, T=52, freeway 5: car span [ -24 -36*4, 11-36*4] = [-24-144, 11-144]=[-168,-133], all negative, no 0, safe. But earlier I thought y=5 unsafe only at t=0, yes.\n\nAction a_{52} = U, y_{53} =6\n\nT=53 (t=5): y=6, freeway 6, at Δt=5, T=53, span [ -47 +6*5, -36 +6*5] = [-47+30, -36+30]=[-17,-6], no 0, safe.\n\nAction a_{53} = U, y_{54} =7\n\nT=54 (t=6): y=7, freeway 7, at Δt=6, T=54, cars: first [45+24,56+24]=[69,80], no; second [ -3 +4*6, 8+24]=[-3+24,32]=[21,32], no 0, safe.\n\nAction a_{54} = U, y_{55} =8\n\nT=55 (t=7): y=8, freeway 8, at Δt=7, T=55, span [ -53 +3*7, -42 +3*7] = [-53+21, -42+21]=[-32,-21], no 0, safe.\n\nAction a_{55} = U, y_{56} =9\n\nNow at turn T=56, y=9, reached.\n\nBut we need to reach at turn t_1 + H -1? In this case, after action at T=55, y_{56}=9.\n\nThe actions are from T=t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nHere, actions at T=48 to T=55, that's 8 actions: T=48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55.\n\nThen at T=56, y=9.\n\nSo H=8, since 8 actions, reaching at turn t_1 + 8.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =55? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is actions for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter that, at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, actions at turns 48 to 55 (8 turns), then at turn 56, position (0,9).\n\nSo H=8.\n\nBut in the answer format, we need to list actions for turns starting from t_1.\n\nIn this sequence, we reached without any issue, and H=8.\n\nBut is there a problem? Earlier I thought about unsafe points, but in this path, we didn't encounter them.\n\nFor example, at T=52, we were at y=5, not y=2 or y=3, and y=5 was safe at that time.\n\nSimilarly, at T=54,55, we were at y=7 and y=8, not y=6, which was unsafe at those times.\n\ny=6 unsafe at T=54 and 55, but in the path, at T=54, we were at y=7, and at T=55, y=8, both safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nAnd we reached in 8 turns.\n\nBut is minimal H=8 possible? Yes, since we need at least 8 up moves.\n\nAnd here we did it directly.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe points we might have missed.\n\nAt T=52, y=2 and y=3 are unsafe, but we were at y=5 at that turn.\n\nSimilarly, at T=54,55, y=6 unsafe, but we were at y=7 and y=8.\n\nAt T=48, y=4,5,7 unsafe, but at T=48, we were at y=1, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=8 with all U actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions are all U.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,1), and we need to reach (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{48} = U\n\nTurn t_1+1: a_{49} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1+7: a_{55} = U\n\nThen at turn 56, y=9.\n\nBut the actions are for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1, which is 48 to 55.\n\nH=8.\n\nIn the answer format: we need to list the actions for each turn.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? No, since we need 8 increases, minimum 8 actions.\n\nWe could go faster? No, each U increases by 1, so 8 steps.\n\nS or D would not help to go faster, so H=8 is minimal.\n\nBut in this case, it works with all U.\n\nBut let's double-check if at any point we might have collision.\n\nAt turn T=48: y=1, freeway 1, safe.\n\nAction U, so y_{49}=2\n\nT=49: y=2, freeway 2, as computed, no car at 0, safe.\n\nAction U, y_{50}=3\n\nT=50: y=3, freeway 3, similar, safe.\n\nAction U, y_{51}=4\n\nT=51: y=4, freeway 4, at T=51, Δt=3, span [ -24-108, 11-108]=[-132,-97] <0, no 0.\n\nSafe, action U, y_{52}=5\n\nT=52: y=5, freeway 5, at T=52, Δt=4, span [ -24-144, 11-144]=[-168,-133] <0, no 0.\n\nSafe, action U, y_{53}=6\n\nT=53: y=6, freeway 6, at T=53, Δt=5, span [ -47+30, -36+30]=[-17,-6] <0, no 0. Safe.\n\nAction U, y_{54}=7\n\nT=54: y=7, freeway 7, at T=54, Δt=6, cars: (56,45,right,4) span [45+24,56+24]=[69,80], no; (8,-3,right,4) span [-3+24,8+24]=[21,32], no 0. Safe.\n\nAction U, y_{55}=8\n\nT=55: y=8, freeway 8, at T=55, Δt=7, span [ -53+21, -42+21]=[-32,-21] <0, no 0. Safe.\n\nAction U, y_{56}=9\n\nReached.\n\nNow, the unsafe at T=52 for y=2 and y=3, but we were not there.\n\nSimilarly, T=54,55 for y=6, not there.\n\nSo all fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=8 with all U actions.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 7, at T=48, it was unsafe, but we were not on it at T=48.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo the sequence is simple.\n\nBut the problem is to output the actions.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\n}\n\nBut H=8, actions from t_1 to t_1+7.\n\nIn the box, it should be the sequence.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbers.\n\nt_1=48.\n\nActions for turn 48 to 55.\n\nIn the format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to the last action turn.\n\nSince H=8, there are 8 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 8 U's.\n\nBut is there any need to wait? In this case, no, since we avoided all unsafe points by not being there at the critical times.\n\nFor example, at T=52, if we were on y=2 or y=3, it would be bad, but we were on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo this should be correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if we can reach faster? No.\n\nOr with fewer actions, but impossible since need +8 in y.\n\nWe could go down to y=0, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nSo H=8 is minimal and achievable.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 8 turns.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 48\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 8, achieved by moving up (U) at every turn from turn 48 to turn 55. This sequence ensures the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 56 without any collisions, as verified below:\n\n- **Collision avoidance**: The unsafe turns for each freeway (when a car occupies \\(x = 0\\)) are:\n  - \\(y = 1\\): always safe.\n  - \\(y = 2\\): unsafe at turn 52.\n  - \\(y = 3\\): unsafe at turn 52.\n  - \\(y = 4\\): unsafe at turn 48.\n  - \\(y = 5\\): unsafe at turn 48.\n  - \\(y = 6\\): unsafe at turns 54 and 55.\n  - \\(y = 7\\): unsafe at turn 48.\n  - \\(y = 8\\): unsafe at turns 62 to 65.\n\nIn the sequence:\n- At turn 48 (\\(t = 0\\) relative), \\(y = 1\\) (safe), action U sets \\(y_{49} = 2\\).\n- At turn 49, \\(y = 2\\) (safe, not turn 52), action U sets \\(y_{50} = 3\\).\n- At turn 50, \\(y = 3\\) (safe, not turn 52), action U sets \\(y_{51} = 4\\).\n- At turn 51, \\(y = 4\\) (safe, not turn 48), action U sets \\(y_{52} = 5\\).\n- At turn 52, \\(y = 5\\) (safe, not turn 48), action U sets \\(y_{53} = 6\\).\n- At turn 53, \\(y = 6\\) (safe, not turns 54 or 55), action U sets \\(y_{54} = 7\\).\n- At turn 54, \\(y = 7\\) (safe, not turn 48), action U sets \\(y_{55} = 8\\).\n- At turn 55, \\(y = 8\\) (safe, not turns 62–65), action U sets \\(y_{56} = 9\\).\n\nThus, the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 56 after 8 actions (turns 48 to 55), with no collisions. Since 8 up moves are required to increase \\(y\\) from 1 to 9, \\(H = 8\\) is minimal.\n\n**Action Sequence**:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 48: U \\\\\nTurn 49: U \\\\\nTurn 50: U \\\\\nTurn 51: U \\\\\nTurn 52: U \\\\\nTurn 53: U \\\\\nTurn 54: U \\\\\nTurn 55: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a particular row at a particular turn, there's no car on that row whose span includes x=0 at that exact turn.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. For each car, I have the head, tail, direction, and speed at turn t1=49. Since the cars move linearly over time, I can find their positions at any future turn T.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t1 = T - 49.\n\nFor a right-moving car, span at T is [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt]\n\nFor left-moving, it's [h - s*Δt, τ - s*Δt]\n\nThe collision happens if at turn T, for the freeway y that I'm on, there is a car such that 0 is in the span at that turn.\n\nAlso, important point: when I move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y_T, and I only check for collision on y_T at turn T. When I arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, I check for collision on y_{T+1} at turn T+1. So the move happens between turns; at the start of turn T, I choose action, then during the turn I move, and at the end of the turn, I'm in the new position for the next turn.\n\nThe player update says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, based on action at t.\n\nAnd collision at turn T if on freeway y_T, 0 in span for some car on that freeway.\n\nSo at turn T, I am at position (0, y_T), and I check for cars on row y_T at time T.\n\nWhen I take action at turn T, it determines y_{T+1}, so during turn T, I am at y_T, and after the action, I move to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it's based on y_T and the cars on row y_T at time T.\n\nNow, I start at turn t1=49, position y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nActions: U (up, y increases by 1), D (down, y decreases by 1), S (stay, y same).\n\ny must stay between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nSince I start at 2 and need to go to 9, I need to go up, so I should mostly use U actions, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nThe minimal number of turns would be at least 7, since from 2 to 9 is 7 steps up, but I might need more if I have to detour or wait.\n\nBut I can only move one row per turn or stay, so the minimum H is 7 if I can go straight up without colliding.\n\nBut I have to check for each row and turn if there's a collision.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8, each can have multiple cars.\n\nGiven:\n\nFreeway 1: one car (96,49, right, 48)  so head=96, tail=49, direction right, speed=48.\n\nSince direction right, and head=96, tail=49, but for right-moving, it should be that head > tail? Let's see the span definition.\n\nFor right-moving: span at t1 is [τ, h], so τ=49, h=96? But it says (head, tail) in the table, but for right, span is [tail, head] or [head, tail]?\n\nLook back:\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIt says Span(t1) = [τ, h] for right-moving.\n\nBut in the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor this car on freeway 1: (96,49, right, 48)\n\nSo head=96, tail=49, direction right.\n\nThen Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [49, 96] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]\n\nFor freeway 1: (96,49,right,48) so at t1=49, span [49,96]\n\nSpeed 48, right-moving.\n\nNow for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars: (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=-36, tail=-47? That seems odd, but possible if car is left of zero.\n\nSpan for right-moving: [τ, h] so for first car, τ=-47, h=-36? Head and tail: in the tuple it's (head, tail), but for span, it's [tail, head] for right.\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=36, tail=25, so [25,36] at t1.\n\nBoth right-moving, speed 12.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? It says \"(-36,-47,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\" same as freeway 2. Is that a typo or intentional? Probably intentional, so freeway 3 has the same car configuration as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: (-60,-25,left,36) one car.\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, span at t1: [h, τ] = [-60, -25]? Head=-60, tail=-25, direction left.\n\nFor left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]\n\nSo here h=-60, τ=-25, so span [ -60, -25 ] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as freeway 4? \"(-60,-25,left,36)\" so identical to freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 6: (-30,-41,right,6) one car.\n\nRight-moving, head=-30, tail=-41? So span at t1: [τ, h] = [-41, -30]\n\nSpeed 6.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (60,49,right,4) and (12,1,right,4)\n\nFirst: head=60, tail=49, span [49,60] at t1? [τ,h] = [49,60]\n\nSecond: head=12, tail=1, span [1,12] at t1.\n\nBoth right, speed 4.\n\nFreeway 8: (-39,-50,right,3) one car.\n\nHead=-39, tail=-50, right, speed 3, span [τ,h] = [-50,-39] at t1.\n\nNow, I need to find when a car on a particular row has 0 in its span at time T.\n\nFor a given freeway i, at time T, collision if for some car on i, 0 ∈ span(T).\n\nSpan(T) depends on the car's parameters and Δt = T - 49.\n\nLet Δt = T - 49.\n\nFor each car, I can find the span at T.\n\nThen 0 in span means min(span) ≤ 0 ≤ max(span), since span is an interval.\n\nFor right-moving car, span(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nFor left-moving, [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nThen 0 in span iff lower ≤ 0 ≤ upper.\n\nNow, for each row, I need to find the times when it is occupied, i.e., when 0 is in some car's span on that row.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars, I need the union of occupied times for each row.\n\nBut for the player, I need to be not on a row when it is occupied at that turn.\n\nSpecifically, for turn T, if I am on row y, then for that y, at time T, no car should have 0 in span.\n\nSo for each row y, I need the set of T where row y is safe, i.e., no collision.\n\nThen I need a path from y=2 at T=49 to y=9 at some T=49+H-1, with actions U,D,S, minimizing H.\n\nSince y must be integer, and I move step by step.\n\nI should compute for each row y from 1 to 8, the times when it is unsafe.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and no cars on y=9, I assume? The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars. But y=0 is the bottom, I start from y=2, but I might go to y=0 if I go down, but since no cars, it should be safe. Similarly y=9 is safe.\n\nBut I need to reach (0,9), so at some turn, I am at y=9.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the collision times.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars by row.\n\nRow 1: one car: right-moving, τ=49, h=96, s=48\n\nSpan at T: [49 + 48 Δt, 96 + 48 Δt]\n\n0 in span iff 49 + 48 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 96 + 48 Δt\n\nSince s=48 high speed, and at t1, min=49>0, so as T increases, min increases, so 0 < min for all T>=t1, so never collision? 49 + 48 Δt >= 49 >0 for Δt>=0, so min >0, so 0 not in span for any T. Similarly max=96+48Δt >0, but since min>0, 0 not <= min, so 0 not in span. So row 1 is always safe? Is that right?\n\nmin = 49 + 48 Δt, at Δt=0, min=49>0, and increases, so yes, min >0 for all T>=49, so 0 < min, so 0 not in [min,max]. Similarly, for other cars that are far away.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nFor row 1 car: at T, min = τ + s Δt = 49 + 48 (T-49)\n\nSince T-49 >=0, min >=49 >0, so min >0, thus 0 not in [min,max], so no collision at any T for row 1. So row 1 is always safe.\n\nOkay, good.\n\nNow row 2: cars: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,12) so τ=-47, h=-36, s=12, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-47 + 12 Δt, -36 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span iff -47 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -36 + 12 Δt\n\nWhich is -47 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -36 + 12 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -47 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 => 12 Δt ≤ 47 => Δt ≤ 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so Δt <= 3 since integer? Δt is integer because turns are discrete.\n\nT is turn number, integer, so Δt = T - 49, integer >=0.\n\nSimilarly, all times are integer.\n\nSo -47 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 => 12 Δt ≤ 47 => Δt ≤ 47/12 = 3 + 11/12, so since Δt integer, Δt <= 3\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -36 + 12 Δt => 12 Δt >= 36 => Δt >= 36/12 = 3\n\nSo both: Δt >=3 and Δt <=3, so Δt=3\n\nThus for this car, 0 in span only when Δt=3.\n\nAt Δt=3, min = -47 + 12*3 = -47 + 36 = -11\n\nMax = -36 + 12*3 = -36 + 36 =0\n\nSo [min,max] = [-11,0], so 0 is included, yes.\n\nFor other Δt, not.\n\nSecond car on row 2: (36,25,right,12) head=36, tail=25, s=12, right\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [25 + 12 Δt, 36 + 12 Δt]\n\nMin = 25 + 12 Δt >=25 >0 for all Δt>=0, so min>0, 0 not in span, never collision.\n\nSo for row 2, only the first car causes collision at Δt=3, i.e., T=49+3=52.\n\nAt T=52, row 2 is unsafe due to first car.\n\nFor other T, safe, since second car never causes issue.\n\nSo row 2 unsafe only at T=52.\n\nΔt=3, T=52.\n\nNow row 3: same as row 2, according to the table.\n\nFreeway 3: same cars as freeway 2: (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nSo identical, so row 3 unsafe only at T=52.\n\nNow row 4: car (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nDirection left, so span at T: [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] = [-60 -36 Δt, -25 -36 Δt]? Let's see.\n\nh = head = -60, τ = tail = -25, direction left.\n\nFor left-moving, span(T) = [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nYes, [ -60 -36 Δt, -25 -36 Δt ]\n\nNow min = -60 -36 Δt, max = -25 -36 Δt\n\n0 in span iff min <= 0 <= max\n\nBut min and max are both decreasing, and at Δt=0, min=-60<0, max=-25<0, so both negative.\n\nAs Δt increases, min and max decrease further, more negative, so min <=0 always true since negative, but max = -25 -36 Δt <= -25 <0, so 0 <= max is false, since max <0.\n\n0 <= max? max is negative, so 0 > max, so 0 not <= max, thus 0 not in span for any Δt.\n\nSimilarly, min <=0 true, but 0 <= max false, so no.\n\nThus row 4 always safe? But let's confirm.\n\nFor example, at Δt=0, span [-60,-25], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nAt Δt=1, [-60-36, -25-36]=[-96,-61], still negative.\n\nNever reaches zero since moving left, starting left of zero.\n\nSo row 4 always safe.\n\nBut freeway 4 has this car, and similarly freeway 5 is same, so row 5 always safe.\n\nNow row 6: car (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nRight-moving, head=-30, tail=-41, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-41 + 6 Δt, -30 + 6 Δt]\n\n0 in span iff -41 + 6 Δt <= 0 <= -30 + 6 Δt\n\nFirst: -41 + 6 Δt <= 0 => 6 Δt <= 41 => Δt <= 41/6 ≈ 6.833, so Δt <= 6\n\nSecond: 0 <= -30 + 6 Δt => 6 Δt >= 30 => Δt >= 5\n\nSo both: Δt >=5 and Δt <=6\n\nThus for Δt=5 and Δt=6.\n\nAt Δt=5: min = -41 + 30 = -11, max = -30 + 30 = 0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt Δt=6: min = -41 + 36 = -5, max = -30 + 36 = 6, so [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nAt Δt=5 and 6, T=49+5=54 and 49+6=55.\n\nSo row 6 unsafe at T=54 and 55.\n\nNow row 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,4) head=60, tail=49, s=4, right\n\nSpan at T: [49 + 4 Δt, 60 + 4 Δt]\n\nMin = 49 + 4 Δt >=49 >0, so never 0 in span.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4) head=12, tail=1, s=4, right\n\nSpan: [1 + 4 Δt, 12 + 4 Δt]\n\nMin =1 +4Δt >=1>0, so also always min>0, never 0 in span.\n\nSo both cars on row 7 are always to the right, min>0, so row 7 always safe.\n\nBut let's confirm: at Δt=0, [1,12] and [49,60], both positive, no zero.\n\nAs time increases, both move right, min increases, so always safe.\n\nGood.\n\nRow 8: car (-39,-50,right,3)\n\nHead=-39, tail=-50, s=3, right\n\nSpan: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-50 + 3 Δt, -39 + 3 Δt]\n\n0 in span iff -50 + 3 Δt <= 0 <= -39 + 3 Δt\n\nFirst: -50 + 3 Δt <= 0 => 3 Δt <= 50 => Δt <= 50/3 ≈16.666, so Δt <=16\n\nSecond: 0 <= -39 + 3 Δt => 3 Δt >=39 => Δt >=13\n\nSo Δt >=13 and Δt <=16\n\nThus for Δt=13,14,15,16\n\nT=49+13=62, 63,64,65.\n\nAt these times, row 8 unsafe.\n\nNow, summarize safe rows:\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: unsafe only at T=52\n\ny=3: unsafe only at T=52\n\ny=4: always safe\n\ny=5: always safe\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=54 and 55\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=62,63,64,65\n\ny=0 and y=9: always safe, no cars.\n\nI start at y=2, T=49.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: since from 2 to 9, 7 steps, but I might need to avoid unsafe times.\n\nAt T=49, I am at y=2.\n\ny=2 is safe at T=49, since unsafe only at T=52.\n\nNow, I can take actions.\n\nI need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut there are unsafe times on some rows.\n\nSpecifically, y=2 and y=3 are unsafe at T=52.\n\ny=6 unsafe at T=54,55.\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=62-65.\n\nSince I start at T=49, and need to go up, I might reach higher rows early to avoid later unsafe times.\n\nBut y=8 unsafe late, so if I go slow, I might hit that, but since I need min turns, I should go fast.\n\nFirst, try to go straight up with no waiting.\n\nFrom y=2 at T=49.\n\nAt T=49, I am at y=2, safe.\n\nI take action U: move to y=3 at T=50? Action at T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T=49, I choose a_{49}, then y_{50} = y_{49} + Δy based on a_{49}.\n\nThen at turn T=50, I am at y_{50}, and so on.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nStart: turn T=49, position y=2.\n\nAfter action at T=49, I go to y for T=50.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, if I always go up: U each turn.\n\nThen:\n\nT=49: y=2, safe (since unsafe only at 52)\n\nAction U: so y_{50} = 3\n\nT=50: at y=3, need to check if safe at T=50.\n\ny=3 unsafe only at T=52, so at T=50, safe. (since 50 !=52)\n\nAction U: y_{51} =4\n\nT=51: at y=4, row 4 always safe, so ok.\n\nAction U: y_{52} =5\n\nT=52: at y=5? y_{52} is position at turn 52.\n\nAt turn T=52, I am at y_{52}.\n\nIf I go straight up:\n\nAfter T=51 at y=4, action U, so y_{52} =5\n\nThen at turn T=52, I am at y=5.\n\ny=5 is always safe, as we said.\n\nBut what about y=2 and y=3 at T=52? I am not on them at T=52, since at T=52 I am on y=5.\n\nOnly when I am on a row at that turn, I care.\n\nAt T=52, y=2 and y=3 are unsafe, but if I am not on them, no problem.\n\nIn this path, at T=52 I am on y=5, safe.\n\nContinue: action U, y_{53} =6\n\nT=53: at y=6, need to check if safe at T=53.\n\ny=6 unsafe at T=54 and 55, not at 53, so safe.\n\nAction U: y_{54} =7\n\nT=54: at y=7, row 7 always safe, ok.\n\nBut y_{54} =7, so at T=54, I am at y=7.\n\nNow, action U: y_{55} =8\n\nT=55: at y=8, need to check safe at T=55.\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=62-65, not at 55, so safe? y=8 unsafe only at 62,63,64,65, so at T=55, safe.\n\nThen action U: y_{56} =9\n\nT=56: at y=9, which is the goal, and safe.\n\nNow, from start to end: started T=49 y=2, ended T=56 y=9.\n\nNumber of turns: from T=49 to T=56, that's 8 turns? Let's see the sequence.\n\nT=49: at y=2, action U\n\nT=50: at y=3, action U\n\nT=51: at y=4, action U\n\nT=52: at y=5, action U\n\nT=53: at y=6, action U\n\nT=54: at y=7, action U\n\nT=55: at y=8, action U\n\nT=56: at y=9, and I have reached.\n\nNow, H is the number of turns? The sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=49, actions from t=49 to t=49+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, I reach at turn t1 + H.\n\nLet's see the position.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action at T, y_{T+1} = y_T + delta.\n\nSo from start turn T=49, y_49=2.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn T=49 + H, position y_{49+H}.\n\nI need y_{49+H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nAfter 0 actions: T=49, y=2\n\nAfter 1 action (at T=49): T=50, y=3\n\nAfter 2 actions: T=51, y=4\n\nAfter 3 actions: T=52, y=5\n\nAfter 4 actions: T=53, y=6\n\nAfter 5 actions: T=54, y=7\n\nAfter 6 actions: T=55, y=8\n\nAfter 7 actions: T=56, y=9\n\nSo after 7 actions, at T=56, y=9.\n\nThus H=7, and I reached at turn 49+7=56.\n\nNow, did I avoid all collisions?\n\nAt each turn:\n\nT=49: y=2, safe (unsafe only at 52)\n\nT=50: y=3, safe (unsafe only at 52)\n\nT=51: y=4, always safe\n\nT=52: y=5, always safe\n\nT=53: y=6, safe (unsafe at 54,55, not 53)\n\nT=54: y=7, always safe\n\nT=55: y=8, safe (unsafe at 62-65, not 55)\n\nT=56: y=9, safe\n\nAll seem safe.\n\nBut at T=52, y=5 is safe, yes.\n\nAnd I didn't go through y=6 at T=54 or 55, which are unsafe.\n\nAt T=53 I was on y=6, which is safe at T=53.\n\nThen at T=54 I am on y=7, safe.\n\ny=6 unsafe at T=54 and 55, but at T=54 I am on y=7, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly T=55 on y=8.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nAnd y=8 is safe at T=55.\n\nSo with H=7, I can reach.\n\nBut is this minimal? 7 is the minimum possible since I need 7 steps up.\n\nI could reach faster? No, from y=2 to y=9, I need at least 7 up moves, so H at least 7.\n\nWith H=7, I have a sequence: all U.\n\nBut let me confirm the actions.\n\nAt each turn, I take action U.\n\nStart: turn t1=49, position (0,2)\n\nAction at t=49: U, so to y=3 at next turn.\n\nThen turn t=50: at (0,3), action U, to y=4\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t=55: at (0,8), action U, to y=9 at turn 56.\n\nAfter action at t=55, y_{56}=9.\n\nThen at turn t=56, I am at (0,9), so I have reached.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from 49 to 55, all U.\n\nt from 49 to 55 inclusive? t=49,50,51,52,53,54,55: that's 7 actions.\n\nH=7.\n\nIn the answer, it should be the actions from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1.\n\nt1=49, H=7, so actions from t=49 to t=49+6=55? Let's see.\n\nThe player takes H actions, starting at turn t1, after H actions, at turn t1 + H, position is reached.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nAfter that, at turn t1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, actions a_{49} to a_{55}, that is t from 0 to 6, since 55=49+6.\n\nH=7, t from 0 to 6, a_{49+0} to a_{49+6}=a_{55}\n\nThen at turn 56=49+7, position y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in the path, I think it's fine, but let me double-check if at any point I might have collision.\n\nFor example, at T=53, y=6.\n\ny=6 is unsafe at T=54 and 55, but at T=53, is it safe?\n\nEarlier I said row 6 unsafe at T=54 and 55, so at T=53 should be safe.\n\nLet me confirm the car on row 6.\n\nCar: (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nAt T, span: [-41 +6 Δt, -30 +6 Δt]\n\nΔt = T - 49\n\nAt T=53, Δt=4, min = -41 + 24 = -17, max = -30 + 24 = -6, so [-17,-6], all negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nAt T=54, Δt=5, min=-41+30=-11, max=-30+30=0, [-11,0], 0 included, unsafe.\n\nAt T=55, Δt=6, min=-41+36=-5, max=-30+36=6, [-5,6], 0 included, unsafe.\n\nAt T=53, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=55, I am on y=8.\n\ny=8 car: (-39,-50,right,3)\n\nAt T=55, Δt=55-49=6\n\nSpan: [-50 + 3*6, -39 + 3*6] = [-50+18, -39+18] = [-32, -21], both negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nUnsafe starts at Δt=13, T=62.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut in the beginning, at T=52, y=2 and y=3 are unsafe, but I was on y=5 at that time, so fine.\n\nSo with all U, I can reach in 7 turns.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut let me see if I can do in fewer? No, 7 is minimum.\n\nPerhaps with waiting or down, but that would take more turns, so no need.\n\nBut in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nBut I recall that for row 2 and 3, unsafe at T=52, but I was not there.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 unsafe at 54,55, but I was at y=6 only at T=53, safe.\n\nAt T=54, I am at y=7, not y=6.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to avoid something else.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, at the turn I am on a row, I need it safe.\n\nIn this path, all positions I occupied are safe at those times.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nT=49: y=2, safe\n\nT=50: y=3, safe\n\nT=51: y=4, safe\n\nT=52: y=5, safe\n\nT=53: y=6, safe\n\nT=54: y=7, safe\n\nT=55: y=8, safe\n\nT=56: y=9, goal\n\nAll safe.\n\nSo minimal H=7 with all U actions.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t_1: U   (which is t=49)\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U  (t=50)\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + 6: U  (t=55)\n\nSince H=7, actions from t=0 to 6 relative to t1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1=6.\n\nSo a_{t1} to a_{t1+6}\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case H=7.\n\nBut is there a way with H=6? For example, if I start higher or something, but I start at y=2, to y=9, need 7 steps, impossible in 6 actions.\n\nAfter 6 actions, I could be at y=8, not 9.\n\nFor example, if I do U all, after 6 actions: from y=2 to y=8, at T=55, but not 9.\n\nNeed one more to 9.\n\nSo H=7 is minimum.\n\nPerhaps with S or D, but that would not help, only increase H.\n\nSo H=7 is minimal.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, all U.\n\nBut let me confirm the car states again.\n\nAnother thing: in row 7, I have cars, but I said always safe, but let me see if at some point they could be near zero.\n\nRow 7 cars: (60,49,right,4) min=49+4Δt >0\n\n(12,1,right,4) min=1+4Δt>0, so never near zero, yes.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps I should list the safe times for each row.\n\nBut in this case, no need.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,2) at turn t1=49.\n\nAnd we have the sequence.\n\nBut in the answer format.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nThen at turn 56, position (0,9).\n\nBut the actions are for turns t=49 to 55.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be written as per the format.\n\nThe format says: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nSince t_1=49.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 55: U\n\nBut Turn 55 is t_1 + 6, since 49+6=55.\n\nH=7, so actions up to t_1 + H -1 =49+6=55.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in the box.\n\nBut I think I should write it clearly.\n\nBut the problem says \"suppose current turn is {t_1}\", and t_1 is given as 49, but in the answer, I should use t_1 or 49?\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so probably with t_1.\n\nBut since t_1=49, it might be fine to write numbers, but to be general, use t_1.\n\nIn the box, it might be with t_1.\n\nLet me see the instruction.\n\n\"Answer Format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\"\n\nSo I need to write with t_1.\n\nAnd for H, it should be minimal, which is 7.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have 7 actions.\n\nNow, but in my sequence, all U, but is there any issue?\n\nAnother point: when I move from one row to another, at the turn, I am on the row before move.\n\nFor example, at turn T, I am on y_T, I choose action, then after, I am on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nAnd at turn T, I check collision on y_T.\n\nIn this case, no problem.\n\nPerhaps for row y=6, at T=53 I am there, safe, and I leave to y=7 at T=54.\n\nAt T=54, y=6 is unsafe, but I am not on it, I am on y=7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if I can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose I go faster? But I start at 2, need to go to 9, 7 steps, no faster.\n\nIf I start with S or D, but that would delay, not help.\n\nSo H=7 is min.\n\nPerhaps with different timing.\n\nFor example, if I stay at some point to avoid later issues, but in this case, no later issues since I reach early before y=8 unsafe times.\n\ny=8 unsafe starts at 62, I am at y=8 at 55, which is fine.\n\nIf I were slower, I might hit y=8 at unsafe time, but with min speed, I avoid.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7, with all U actions.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 4: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 5: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 6: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 49\\) is 7. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) at every turn from \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + 6\\).\n\n### Verification of Path and Collision Avoidance:\n- **Turn 49 (position \\(y = 2\\))**: Row 2 is safe at turn 49 (unsafe only at turn 52). Action U moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 50.\n- **Turn 50 (position \\(y = 3\\))**: Row 3 is safe at turn 50 (unsafe only at turn 52). Action U moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 51.\n- **Turn 51 (position \\(y = 4\\))**: Row 4 is always safe (no collision at any turn). Action U moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 52.\n- **Turn 52 (position \\(y = 5\\))**: Row 5 is always safe (no collision at any turn). Action U moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 53.\n- **Turn 53 (position \\(y = 6\\))**: Row 6 is safe at turn 53 (unsafe at turns 54 and 55). Action U moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 54.\n- **Turn 54 (position \\(y = 7\\))**: Row 7 is always safe (no collision at any turn). Action U moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 55.\n- **Turn 55 (position \\(y = 8\\))**: Row 8 is safe at turn 55 (unsafe at turns 62–65). Action U moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 56.\n- **Turn 56 (position \\(y = 9\\))**: Goal reached, and row 9 has no cars, so it is safe.\n\nThis path achieves the goal in \\(H = 7\\) turns, which is the minimum possible since moving from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 9\\) requires at least 7 upward moves. All positions during the sequence are safe, with no collisions on the relevant rows at the respective turns.\n\n### Answer Format:\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1\\) (i.e., turns 49 to 55) is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } t_1: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } t_1 + 1: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } t_1 + 2: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } t_1 + 3: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } t_1 + 4: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } t_1 + 5: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } t_1 + 6: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 3) at turn t_1 = 50. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. I need to find a sequence of actions: U (up), D (down), or S (stay), that moves the player vertically.\n\nThe player's y-position changes based on the action: U increases y by 1, D decreases by 1, S keeps it the same. y must stay between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nCollision occurs if at any turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and there's a car on that freeway such that the car's span includes 0 at that exact turn T. The car spans move over time based on their direction and speed.\n\nImportant point: when you move to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn. So if at turn T you're on row y, and you move to y+1, you execute the move at the end of turn T, so at turn T you're still on row y, and at turn T+1 you're on row y+1. Therefore, for collision, at turn T, we only care about cars on the row y_T that the player is currently on.\n\nAlso, collision is checked only if the player is on a freeway row (y=1 to 8), since y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars there. The goal is (0,9), which is safe.\n\nNow, let's list the cars for each freeway at turn t_1 = 50.\n\nFreeway k=1: one car, head=-48, tail=-95, direction=right, speed=48. Since it's right-moving, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]. Head and tail: for right-moving, head is the front, so higher x, tail lower x. In the span, it's given as (head, tail), so for right, head > tail, I think.\n\nLook: for right-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" and then Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]. Since it's moving right, τ is the left end, h is the right end. So at t_1, position is from τ to h, with h > τ.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: head is left end, tail is right end, so head < tail.\n\nIn the car state:\n\nFor k=1: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nSince direction is right, head is -48, tail is -95. But -48 > -95, so head is higher x, so at t_1, span is from τ = -95 to h = -48.\n\nThen at time T, span is [ -95 + 48*(T-50), -48 + 48*(T-50) ]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut for collision, we care when this span includes 0.\n\nCollision if 0 is in [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] for right-moving, or [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)] for left-moving? Let's see the update.\n\nFrom the rule:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince h is head, tail τ, and for left-moving, head is left, tail is right, so h < τ, and moving left, so both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right: [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nNow, for k=1: right-moving, s=48, τ=-95, h=-48\n\nAt time T, span [ -95 + 48(T-50), -48 + 48(T-50) ]\n\nSet this to include 0:\n\n-95 + 48(T-50) ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 48(T-50)\n\nSolve:\n\nFirst inequality: -95 + 48(T-50) ≤ 0 => 48(T-50) ≤ 95 => T-50 ≤ 95/48 ≈ 1.979 => T ≤ 51.979, so T≤51 since integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -48 + 48(T-50) => 48 ≤ 48(T-50) => 1 ≤ T-50 => T ≥ 51\n\nSo T=51: both inequalities: T≥51 and T≤51.979, so T=51.\n\nAt T=51: left end: -95 + 48(1) = -95+48= -47? T-50=1, so -95 + 48*1 = -95+48= -47\n\nRight end: -48 + 48*1 = 0\n\nSo span [-47, 0] at T=51, which includes 0? -47 to 0, so x=0 is included since 0 is the right end.\n\nYes, so at T=51, on freeway 1, there is a car at x=0.\n\nBut only if player is on freeway 1 at T=51.\n\nSimilarly, for other times.\n\nT=51 is the only time when 0 is in span for k=1.\n\nBecause for T=50: span at T=50 is [ -95 +0, -48+0] = [-95,-48], 0 not in.\n\nT=52: left: -95+48*2= -95+96=1, right: -48+96=48, [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo only T=51 collision possible on freeway 1.\n\nNow, freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, so τ=-35? Head=-24, tail=-35?

Since it starts at 37 to 48 and moving right, always positive, never reaches 0.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Cars: (-24, -35, right, 12) and (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nFirst car same as k=2 first car, so collision at T=52.\n\nSecond car same, no collision.\n\nFreeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so head is left end? For left-moving, span at t_1: [h, τ] = [48,83]? But head and tail: it says (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor left-moving, head is the front, which is left, tail is right, so h < τ.\n\nHere head=48, tail=83, so h=48, τ=83.\n\nSpan at T: [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)] = [48 - 36(T-50), 83 - 36(T-50)]\n\nSet 0 in:\n\n48 -36(T-50) ≤ 0 ≤ 83 -36(T-50)\n\nFirst inequality: 48 -36(T-50) ≤ 0 => 48 ≤ 36(T-50) => 48/36 ≤ T-50 => 4/3 ≈1.333 ≤ T-50 => T ≥ 51.333, so T≥52\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 83 -36(T-50) => 36(T-50) ≤ 83 => T-50 ≤ 83/36 ≈2.305 => T ≤ 52.305, so T≤52\n\nThus T=52.\n\nAt T=52: left: 48 -36(2) =48-72= -24?

Let's see.\n\nThe player position at turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, and at t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nt_1 =50, so at time 50 + H -1, y=9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, at time 50, y=9, but start at y=3, so not possible.\n\nMinimal H, meaning minimal number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nEach action changes the state.\n\nStart at t=50, y=3.\n\nAfter action at t=50, at t=51, y changes, and so on.\n\nThe position at turn T is after the action of turn T-1, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t_1=50, player is at (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,3)\n\nThen, for each turn, we apply action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t at time t.\n\nSo at time t, we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nThen, at time t, we are at y_t, and we check collision based on y_t and cars on row y_t at time t.\n\nSimilarly, at time t+1, we are at y_{t+1}, check collision on row y_{t+1} at time t+1.\n\nWe start at t=50, y=3.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn, say T_final, so at turn T_final, y_{T_final} =9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, no issue.\n\nThe number of turns H: from t=50 to t=50 + H -1, so actions from a_{50} to a_{50 + H -1}, and at time 50 + H -1, y=9.\n\nFor example, if we do nothing, at t=50, y=3, not 9.\n\nAfter one action, at t=51, y could be 2,3,4.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=3, minimum 6 steps up, so H=6, at t=55, y=9? Let's see.\n\nStart t=50, y=3\n\nAfter a_{50}, at t=51, y = y_50 + Δy_50\n\nSimilarly, after a_{51}, at t=52, y = y_51 + Δy_51, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, at time 50+k, y is set.\n\nWe need y_{50 + H -1} =9? No.\n\nt_1 + H -1, t_1=50, so at time 50 + H -1, y=9.\n\nTime at which y=9 is t_final = 50 + H -1.\n\nThe actions are for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, i.e., from 50 to 50 + H -1.\n\nNumber of actions is H.\n\nFor example, if we start at t=50, y=3.\n\nIf we go directly up: a_50=U, then at t=51, y=4\n\na_51=U, t=52, y=5\n\na_52=U, t=53, y=6\n\na_53=U, t=54, y=7\n\na_54=U, t=55, y=8\n\na_55=U, t=56, y=9\n\nSo at t=56, y=9, so H=7? Turns: actions at t=50,51,52,53,54,55, that's 6 actions, but at t=55, after a_55=U, at t=56 y=9.\n\nTime when y=9 is t=56.\n\nt_final = 50 + H -1 =56, so 50 + H -1 =56, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nActions from t=50 to t=56? t=50 to t=50+H-1.\n\n50 + H -1 =56, so H-1=6, H=7, actions at t=50,51,52,53,54,55,56? No.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1=50, so a_{50 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor t=0, a_{50}, t=1, a_{51}, ..., up to t=H-1, a_{50 + H -1}\n\nThen at time t_1 + H -1 = 50 + H -1, y=9.\n\nIn the direct up path, at time 56, y=9, so 50 + H -1 =56, so H-1=6, H=7.\n\nActions: a_50 to a_56? a_{50} to a_{50 + H -1} = a_{50} to a_{56}, but in the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so a_{50+0} to a_{50+(H-1)} = a_{50} to a_{50+H-1}\n\n50+H-1=56, so a_{50} to a_{56}, that's 7 actions, but from y=3 to y=9, it takes 6 steps up, but the last action at t=56 sets y=9 at t=57? I think I have confusion.\n\nLet's clarify the state.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, player is at position y_t.\n\nThen, we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen, at time t, we are on row y_t, and we check for collision: if y_t between 1 and 8, and if there is a car on that row with 0 in span at time t.\n\nThen, after action, at time t+1, we are at y_{t+1}, and repeat.\n\nSo for the goal, at some turn T, if y_T =9, and T is the time when we reach, but since y_T=9, it's safe, no collision.\n\nIn the sequence, we stop when y=9 at that turn.\n\nIn the direct path:\n\nStart t=50, y=3. We are on y=3, need to check collision? At t=50, on freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 has collision at T=52, not at t=50.\n\nAt t=50, for k=3, cars: as above, no collision at t=50.\n\nThen we apply a_50, say U, then y_{51} =4.\n\nNow at t=51, we are on y=4? At turn t=51, position is y_{51}, which was set after a_50.\n\nAt time t=51, y_t = y_{51} =4.\n\nThen check collision on y=4 at time t=51.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, which has collision at T=52, not at T=51.\n\nAt T=51, for k=4, earlier: span at T=51 for k=4: [48-36(1), 83-36(1)] = [12,47], no 0, so safe.\n\nThen a_51, say U, y_{52}=5.\n\nAt t=52, y=5, on freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 has collision at T=52, as above.\n\nAt t=52, for k=5, which is same as k=4, collision at T=52.\n\nSpan at T=52: [48-72, 83-72]? T-50=2, s=36, h=48, τ=83, left-moving, span [48-72, 83-72] = [-24,11], includes 0, so collision if on y=5 at t=52.\n\nIn this case, at t=52, y=5, so collision.\n\nTherefore, in the direct up path, when we go to y=5 at t=52, we collide.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up, at t=52, y=5, collision.\n\nSo we need to avoid that.\n\nAlso, other dangerous times.\n\nNow, we need to find a path from y=3 to y=9 with minimal H, avoiding being on dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nDangerous times:\n\nFor each row, when collision occurs:\n\ny=1: T=51\n\ny=2: T=52\n\ny=3: T=52 (since same as y=2)\n\ny=4: T=52\n\ny=5: T=52\n\ny=6: T=54,55\n\ny=7: T=62,63,64\n\ny=8: T=62,63,64,65\n\ny=3 has collision only at T=52? For y=3, freeway 3, cars same as y=2, collision at T=52.\n\nAt t=52, if on y=3, collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at t=52 collision, y=5 at t=52 collision.\n\nNow, player starts at t=50, y=3.\n\nAt t=50, y=3, safe since no collision at t=50 for y=3.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, we can go down to y=0 to avoid, but that might take more turns.\n\nMinimal H should be as small as possible.\n\nFirst, the direct distance is 6, so H min at least 6 or 7, but with detours, H might be larger.\n\nIn terms of time, we need to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nLet me list the times from t=50 onwards.\n\nAt t=50: player at y=3, safe.\n\nWe apply a_50.\n\nOptions: U, D, S.\n\nIf S, y_{51}=3\n\nIf U, y_{51}=4\n\nIf D, y_{51}=2\n\nThen at t=51, we are at y_{51}, and check collision.\n\nNow, at t=51, dangerous rows: y=1 has collision at t=51.\n\ny=1 at t=51 collision.\n\nOther rows: y=2 at t=51: for y=2, collision at t=52, not t=51.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at t=51: collision at t=52, not t=51.\n\ny=4 at t=51: safe, as above.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 all safe at t=51.\n\nOnly y=1 dangerous at t=51.\n\nSimilarly, at t=52: dangerous rows y=2,3,4,5 all have collision at t=52.\n\ny=2,3,4,5 all collide at t=52.\n\ny=1 at t=52: for y=1, collision only at t=51, not t=52.\n\ny=6 at t=52: collision at 54,55, not 52.\n\netc.\n\nSo at t=52, rows 2,3,4,5 are all dangerous.\n\nNow, back to player.\n\nStart t=50, y=3 safe.\n\nAfter a_50, at t=51 y could be 2,3,4.\n\nIf at t=51 y=2: but y=2 is dangerous at t=51? No, y=2 dangerous only at t=52, not t=51.\n\nAt t=51, y=2 is safe, since collision for y=2 at t=52.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at t=51 safe.\n\ny=4 at t=51 safe.\n\nOnly y=1 dangerous at t=51, but we are not on y=1.\n\nSo at t=51, whatever y we are (2,3,4), all safe.\n\nThen at t=51, we apply a_51, to go to y_{52}.\n\ny_{52} could be 1,2,3,4,5 depending on current y and action.\n\nBut at t=52, rows y=2,3,4,5 are dangerous.\n\nSo we need to not be on y=2,3,4,5 at t=52.\n\nThat means at time t=52, y_{52} should not be in {2,3,4,5}.\n\nPossible values for y_{52}: since at t=51, y_{51} is 2,3, or4 (from previous).\n\nIf y_{51}=2, then a_51 can be U, to y_{52}=3; D to y_{52}=1; S to y_{52}=2.\n\nIf y_{51}=3, U to4, D to2, S to3.\n\nIf y_{51}=4, U to5, D to3, S to4.\n\nNow, at t=52, we need y_{52} not in {2,3,4,5}, so y_{52} must be 1 or 6 or higher, or 0.\n\nBut y=1 might be dangerous? At t=52, y=1 is safe, only dangerous at t=51.\n\ny=0 safe, y=6 safe at t=52, etc.\n\nBut y=6 is freeway, but at t=52, no collision, as per earlier.\n\nSo possible y_{52} to avoid danger: 0,1,6,7,8,9 but since we start from lower, 6 might be reachable.\n\nFrom y_{51}, if we go up or down.\n\nCase 1: if at t=51, y_{51}=2\n\nThen to avoid y_{52} in {2,3,4,5}, we must not go to 2,3,4,5.\n\nWith a_51: if U, to3; D to1; S to2.\n\nSo S to2 or U to3 both bad, only D to1 is possible, y_{52}=1.\n\ny=1 at t=52 is safe.\n\nCase 2: if y_{51}=3\n\nThen a_51: U to4, D to2, S to3. All lead to y_{52} in {2,3,4}, all bad. D to2, U to4, S to3, all in {2,3,4}, which are dangerous at t=52. No way to go to safe y.\n\ny_{52} could be 1 or 5, but from y=3, D to2 or U to4, not directly to1 or5.\n\nWith one action, from y=3, can only go to 2,3,4. Cannot reach 1 or 5 or 6 directly.\n\nSo if y_{51}=3, then at t=52, whatever a_51, y_{52} will be 2,3, or4, all dangerous, collision.\n\nTherefore, we must not be at y=3 at t=51.\n\nThat is, y_{51} cannot be 3.\n\nSimilarly, if y_{51}=4, then a_51: U to5, D to3, S to4. All lead to y_{52} in {3,4,5}, all dangerous at t=52. U to5, D to3, S to4, all in {3,4,5}, dangerous. Cannot go to safe y.\n\nOnly if y_{51}=2, we can go down to y_{52}=1, which is safe.\n\nTherefore, the only safe possibility is to be at y=2 at t=51, and then go down to y=1 at t=52.\n\nBut y=1 at t=52 is safe, as established.\n\nNow, back to t=50.\n\nAt t=50, y=3.\n\nWe apply a_50.\n\nTo have y_{51}=2, we must do a_50=D, so y_{51}=2.\n\nIf a_50=S, y_{51}=3, but we cannot have y_{51}=3, as above.\n\nIf a_50=U, y_{51}=4, which also leads to problem.\n\nOnly a_50=D, y_{51}=2.\n\nThen at t=51, y=2, safe (since no collision at t=51 for y=2).\n\nThen at t=51, we must do a_51=D, to go to y_{52}=1.\n\nBecause if we do S or U, we go to y_{52}=2 or 3, dangerous.\n\nSo a_51=D, y_{52}=1.\n\nAt t=52, y=1, and since collision for y=1 only at t=51, not t=52, so safe.\n\nNow, from here, we need to go up to y=9.\n\nWe are at t=52, y=1.\n\nNow, we can start moving up.\n\nBut need to avoid other dangers.\n\nFor example, y=6 dangerous at t=54 and 55.\n\ny=7 at 62,63,64, but that might be later.\n\nFirst, from t=52, y=1.\n\nWe apply actions to go up.\n\nBut we might need to wait or something.\n\nSince we are at y=1, we can go up to y=2, but y=2 might be dangerous at other times? Only at t=52, which has passed.\n\nt=52 is now, we are at t=52, y=1.\n\nCollision times are for specific turns.\n\nFor y=2, collision only at t=52, as per earlier.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAt t=52, no issue for future, except that we need to pass through rows at certain times.\n\nNow, from t=52, y=1.\n\nWe can go up.\n\nBut y=6 has danger at t=54 and 55.\n\nt=54 is soon.\n\nCurrent time t=52.\n\nIf we go directly up:\n\na_52=U, t=53 y=2\n\na_53=U, t=54 y=3\n\na_54=U, t=55 y=4\n\na_55=U, t=56 y=5\n\na_56=U, t=57 y=6\n\na_57=U, t=58 y=7\n\na_58=U, t=59 y=8\n\na_59=U, t=60 y=9\n\nBut we have dangers.\n\nAt t=54, y=3? In this sequence, at t=54, y=3 (since a_53=U, from y=2 at t=53 to y=3 at t=54? Let's see:\n\nt=52: y=1\n\na_52=U, y_{53}=2\n\nAt t=53, y=2, is it dangerous? y=2 collision only at t=52, which has passed, so at t=53, y=2 is safe.\n\nThen a_53=U, y_{54}=3\n\nAt t=54, y=3. Now, y=3 collision at t=52 only? Earlier for y=3, only collision at T=52, not other times. So at t=54, y=3 should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 danger at t=54,55.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=54, y=3, not on y=6.\n\nThen a_54=U, y_{55}=4\n\nt=55, y=4. y=4 collision only at t=52, so safe.\n\na_55=U, y_{56}=5\n\nt=56, y=5, collision only at t=52, safe.\n\na_56=U, y_{57}=6\n\nt=57, y=6. Now y=6 has collision at t=54 and t=55.\n\nAt t=57, is it dangerous? t=57 >55, and no collision after, so safe? From earlier, for y=6, collisions at T=54 and 55 only.\n\nSo at t=57, safe.\n\nThen continue up.\n\nBut at t=57 y=6, safe.\n\na_57=U, y_{58}=7\n\nt=58, y=7\n\ny=7 has collisions at t=62,63,64. t=58 <62, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_58=U, y_{59}=8\n\nt=59, y=8\n\ny=8 collisions at t=62,63,64,65. t=59<62, safe.\n\na_59=U, y_{60}=9\n\nt=60, y=9, safe.\n\nSo in this path, we reached at t=60, with H=11? Let's count.\n\nFrom start: t=50, action a_50\n\nWe did a_50=D to go down\n\na_51=D down to y=1\n\nThen from t=52, y=1, we went up: a_52=U, a_53=U, a_54=U, a_55=U, a_56=U, a_57=U, a_58=U, a_59=U\n\nThat's 9 actions? List:\n\nActions: at t=50: D\n\nt=51: D\n\nt=52: U\n\nt=53: U\n\nt=54: U\n\nt=55: U\n\nt=56: U\n\nt=57: U\n\nt=58: U\n\nt=59: U\n\nAt t=59, after a_59=U, y_{60}=9.\n\nSo at time t=60, y=9.\n\nt_final = 50 + H -1 =60, so 50 + H -1 =60, H-1=10, H=11.\n\nBut earlier I thought minimal 6, but we had to go down first.\n\nIn this path, we avoided the t=52 danger by going down to y=1.\n\nBut at t=54 and t=55, we were on y=3 and y=4, which were safe since their danger was only at t=52.\n\nAnd y=6 we reached at t=57, after danger times.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nPerhaps we can go up faster or avoid going down.\n\nAnother idea: at t=50, instead of going down, can we go up to y=4 at t=51, but earlier we saw that if y_{51}=4, then at t=52 we are stuck because whatever we do, y_{52} will be 3,4, or5, all dangerous.\n\nUnless we can jump, but we can only change by 1.\n\nSo from y=4 at t=51, we cannot avoid being on 3,4,5 at t=52.\n\nSimilarly for y=3 at t=51.\n\nOnly by being at y=2 at t=51, we can go down to y=1 at t=52.\n\nBut y=1 at t=52 is safe.\n\nThen from there, we go up.\n\nBut in the up path, we took many steps.\n\nSince y=0 is safe, we could go to y=0 and wait, but that might take more time.\n\nFor example, from t=52, y=1, we could go down to y=0, but that adds extra steps.\n\nNot necessary.\n\nIn the direct up from y=1, we reached y=9 at t=60.\n\nBut let's see if we can go faster.\n\nAnother thought: after avoiding t=52, we can go directly to higher y faster, but since we can only move one step, not really.\n\nPerhaps we can be on safe rows at critical times.\n\nFor example, at t=54 and t=55, y=6 is dangerous, so we should not be on y=6 at those times.\n\nIn the previous path, we were not on y=6 at t=54 or 55.\n\nt=54 we were on y=3, t=55 on y=4.\n\nNow, the danger for y=6 is only at t=54 and 55, so if we pass y=6 before or after, it's fine.\n\nSimilarly for later times, but t=62 is far, so if we reach earlier, no problem.\n\nIn this case, from y=1 at t=52, to y=9, min 8 steps up? From y=1 to y=9, difference 8, so 8 actions up, reaching at t=52 + 8 = t=60, as above.\n\nt=52 y=1, a_52=U, t=53 y=2, ..., up to a_59=U, t=60 y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut we used two extra steps to go down at the beginning.\n\nCan we save some steps?\n\nFor example, at t=50, instead of going down, can we stay or something.\n\nBut if we stay at t=50, a_50=S, y_{51}=3.\n\nThen at t=51, y=3, safe.\n\nBut then at t=51, whatever we do: if U, y_{52}=4; D y_{52}=2; S y_{52}=3. All lead to y=2,3, or4 at t=52, all dangerous.\n\nNo escape.\n\nSimilarly if we go up at t=50, y_{51}=4, same issue.\n\nSo we must go down at t=50 to y=2 at t=51.\n\nThen down to y=1 at t=52.\n\nNo choice for the first two actions.\n\nThen from t=52, y=1, we need to go up.\n\nBut perhaps we can go up faster or delay to avoid other things, but in this case, no need, since y=6 danger is later but we pass it after.\n\nt=54 is soon, but we are not on y=6 at that time.\n\nIn the path, at t=54, we are on y=3, which is fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the times.\n\nt=52: y=1\n\na_52=U: y_{53}=2, at t=53 y=2\n\na_53=U: y_{54}=3, t=54 y=3\n\na_54=U: y_{55}=4, t=55 y=4\n\na_55=U: y_{56}=5, t=56 y=5\n\na_56=U: y_{57}=6, t=57 y=6\n\nNow y=6 at t=57. Dangerous times for y=6 are t=54 and t=55. t=57 >55, so safe.\n\na_57=U: y_{58}=7, t=58 y=7\n\na_58=U: y_{59}=8, t=59 y=8\n\na_59=U: y_{60}=9, t=60 y=9\n\nAll safe.\n\nBut H=11? Actions from t=50 to t=59? t=50 to t=59 is 10 actions? t=50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59: that's 10 actions.\n\nThen at t=60, y=9.\n\nt_final = 50 + H -1 =60, so H-1=10, H=11, yes 11 actions? No.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=50 to t=59 inclusive is 10 actions: indices 50 to 59.\n\nThen after a_59, at t=60, y=9.\n\nSo time t=60, y=9.\n\nThe actions are for turns t=50 to t=59, which is 10 turns, H=10.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 50 + H -1 =59? Let's see the goal.\n\nWe need at time t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nt_1=50.\n\nSet 50 + H -1 = T, y_T=9.\n\nIn this case, T=60, so 50 + H -1 =60, H-1=10, H=11.\n\nBut actions at t=50 to t=50+H-1 = t=50 to t=60? t=50 to t=60 is 11 actions? Confusion.\n\nPerhaps I should think of the number of actions.\n\nStart at t=50, before any action, y=3.\n\nAfter first action a_50, at t=51, y changes.\n\nAfter second action a_51, at t=52, y changes, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, at time 50+k, y is set.\n\nWe need y_{50+k} =9 for some k.\n\nThen the number of actions H=k.\n\nTime when y=9 is t=50+H.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from a_{50} to a_{50+H-1}, and at time 50+H, y=9.\n\nBut the goal says at time t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nt_1=50, so at time 50 + H -1, y=9.\n\nIn the down-then-up path:\n\nAfter a_50 (D), at t=51, y=2\n\nAfter a_51 (D), at t=52, y=1\n\nAfter a_52 (U), at t=53, y=2\n\nAfter a_53 (U), at t=54, y=3\n\nAfter a_54 (U), at t=55, y=4\n\nAfter a_55 (U), at t=56, y=5\n\nAfter a_56 (U), at t=57, y=6\n\nAfter a_57 (U), at t=58, y=7\n\nAfter a_58 (U), at t=59, y=8\n\nAfter a_59 (U), at t=60, y=9\n\nSo y=9 at t=60.\n\nWe need at time t_1 + H -1 = 50 + H -1 =60, so 50 + H -1 =60, H-1=10, H=11.\n\nActions at t=50 to t=50+H-1 = t=50 to t=59, that's 10 actions, but H=11? Inconsistency.\n\nt from 50 to 59 is 10 actions.\n\nBut 50 + H -1 =59 if H=10, but at t=59, y=8, not 9.\n\nAt t=59, after a_58? Let's list the time and y_t.\n\nAt t=50: y=3 (initial)\n\nAfter a_50: y_{51} set to 2 (if D)\n\nAt t=51: y=2\n\nAfter a_51: y_{52} set to 1 (if D)\n\nAt t=52: y=1\n\nAfter a_52: y_{53} set to 2 (if U)\n\nAt t=53: y=2\n\nAfter a_53: y_{54} set to 3 (if U)\n\nAt t=54: y=3\n\nAfter a_54: y_{55} set to 4 (if U)\n\nAt t=55: y=4\n\nAfter a_55: y_{56} set to 5 (if U)\n\nAt t=56: y=5\n\nAfter a_56: y_{57} set to 6 (if U)\n\nAt t=57: y=6\n\nAfter a_57: y_{58} set to 7 (if U)\n\nAt t=58: y=7\n\nAfter a_58: y_{59} set to 8 (if U)\n\nAt t=59: y=8\n\nAfter a_59: y_{60} set to 9 (if U)\n\nAt t=60: y=9\n\nSo at time t=60, y=9.\n\nThe time when y=9 is t=60.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 50 + H -1 =60, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nBut the actions are from a_50 to a_59, which is 10 actions, but H should include up to the action that sets y=9.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1=50, so t from 0 to H-1, so a_{50} to a_{50 + (H-1)}\n\nAt time after a_{50 + (H-1)}, y_{50 + H} is set, but the position at time t_1 + H -1 is y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nIn this notation, at time T, y_T is position.\n\nAt time t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the example, at time 60, y_60=9, so t_1 + H -1 =60, 50 + H -1 =60, H-1=10, H=11.\n\nActions for t=0 to 10: a_{50+0} to a_{50+10} = a_{50} to a_{60}\n\nBut in the path, we have actions up to a_59, which sets y_60.\n\nTo have y at time T=60, we need actions up to a_59.\n\na_59 is for turn 59, which sets y_60.\n\nFor the sequence, it should include a_{50} to a_{59}, for H=10 actions? Let's see the turn indices.\n\nThe sequence is for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, in direct up from y=3: a_50=U, sets y_51=4\n\na_51=U, y_52=5\n\n...\n\na_55=U, y_56=9\n\nThen at time t=56, y=9.\n\nSo t_1 + H -1 =56, 50 + H -1=56, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nActions at t=50 to t=56? t=50 to 56 is 7 actions, but only 6 needed? a_50 to a_55: 6 actions, sets y_56=9.\n\nt=50 to t=55 inclusive: 6 actions.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =55 if H=6, but y at t=55 is 8, not 9.\n\nAt time t=55, y_55=8 (after a_54=U from y_54=7? Let's not confuse.\n\nIn general, after k actions, y at time t_1 + k.\n\nStart t_1, y_t1.\n\nAfter first action, y_{t1+1}, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nThen the time t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nBut the goal is at time t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nSo there's a offset.\n\nTo resolve, in the answer format, we need to output actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and at that time, y=9.\n\nSo for the down-up path, at t=60, y=9, so t_1 + H -1 =60, H-1=10, H=11, actions from t=50 to t=50+10=60? t=50 to t=60.\n\nBut at t=60, we don't need action if y=9, but the sequence includes actions up to turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, for t=60, if we are at y=9, we can do S or something, but the position is already 9.\n\nPerhaps for the last turn, we do an action, but if y=9, we can do S to stay.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify actions until we reach.\n\nIn the down-up path, we can stop at a_59, with y=9 at t=60.\n\nBut for the action at t=60, if we include, we can do S.\n\nBut let's see the minimal H.\n\nBack to the problem, perhaps we can reach faster.\n\nAnother idea: after going to y=1 at t=52, we can go directly to y=9 with fewer steps? No, min 8 steps.\n\nBut we can be on y=6 at safe time.\n\nFor example, at t=52, y=1, instead of going up immediately, we could stay or something, but that would delay.\n\nWorse.\n\nGo up but slower to avoid y=6 at t=54,55.\n\nBut y=6 danger at t=54,55, so if we are on y=6 before or after.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=6 at t=53 or earlier, or t=56 or later.\n\nBut from y=1 at t=52, to y=6, difference 5, so min 5 actions, reaching at t=57 or earlier.\n\nt=52 y=1\n\na_52=U, t=53 y=2\n\na_53=U, t=54 y=3\n\na_54=U, t=55 y=4\n\na_55=U, t=56 y=5\n\na_56=U, t=57 y=6\n\nSo at t=57, y=6, which is after t=55, safe.\n\nIf we go faster, we can't, because from y=1, to y=6 in 5 steps, earliest at t=57.\n\nAt t=53, if we could be at y=6, but from y=1 at t=52, a_52=U, t=53 y=2, cannot be higher.\n\nSo t=57 is earliest to reach y=6 from here.\n\nSimilarly, to y=9 at t=60.\n\nBut we have later dangers on y=7 and y=8, but t=62 is later, so if we reach y=9 at t=60, no problem.\n\ny=7 danger at t=62,63,64, we are at y=7 at t=58, which is before, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at t=59, before t=62, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut H=11 seems large.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid going all the way down.\n\nAnother idea: at t=50, go up to y=4? But then at t=51 y=4, then at t=52, we must not be on 2,3,4,5.\n\nBut from y=4, we can only go to 3,4,5.\n\nUnless we go down to y=3 or something, but all dangerous.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=6 directly, but from y=3, it takes time.\n\nt=50 y=3\n\nIf we go up fast: a_50=U, t=51 y=4\n\nBut at t=51, y=4 safe, but then at t=52, problem.\n\nIf at t=51, we go down, a_51=D, then y_{52}=3, but y=3 dangerous at t=52.\n\nWorse.\n\nNo, we must go down at the beginning.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=0.\n\nFor example, at t=50, a_50=D, y_{51}=2\n\nThen at t=51, y=2, instead of going down, we could go up or stay, but then at t=52, if we are on y=2 or3, dangerous.\n\nOnly by going down to y=1 at t=52.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11 for this path.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach earlier by being on safe rows.\n\nFor example, the danger at t=52 is only for y=2,3,4,5.\n\nIf we can be on y=1 or y=6 or higher at t=52.\n\nBut at t=50, y=3, after two actions, at t=52, y can be from 1 to 5.\n\ny=1: if we go down twice.\n\ny=5: if we go up twice, but y=5 dangerous at t=52.\n\ny=6: impossible in two steps from y=3.\n\nMax to y=5, min to y=1.\n\nSo only y=1 is safe at t=52.\n\nThus, we must be at y=1 at t=52.\n\nThen from there, to y=9, min 8 steps, so total min 10 actions? From t=50 to t=52, we have two actions: a_50 and a_51 to reach y=1 at t=52.\n\nThen from t=52, actions a_52 to a_59 to reach y=9 at t=60.\n\nActions: a_50, a_51, a_52, ..., a_59: that's 10 actions.\n\nTime from t=50 to t=59 for actions.\n\nAt time t=60, y=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 50 + H -1 =60, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nFor H=11, actions from a_{50} to a_{50+10} = a_{60}.\n\nBut at t=60, we need to specify an action, but y is already 9, so we can do S.\n\nIn the path, we don't have a_60, but for the sequence, we can add a_{60}=S or something.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nPerhaps for the last turn, when y=9, we stop, so we don't need action if already at goal.\n\nBut the sequence should include actions until the position is reached.\n\nIn the direct case, with no obstacles, from y=3 to y=9, actions a_50 to a_55 (6 actions), at t=56 y=9, so t_1 + H -1 =56, 50+H-1=56, H-1=6, H=7, actions a_50 to a_{56}? t=50 to 56 is 7 actions, but only 6 needed.\n\nInconsistency in indexing.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's define T such that at time T, y_T=9.\n\nThen the actions taken are from t=50 to t=T-1, to set y_T.\n\nNumber of actions H = T - 50.\n\nThen for the sequence, actions from a_{50} to a_{T-1}.\n\nThen at time T, y=9.\n\nBut the goal says at time t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 50 + (T-50) -1 = T-1, not T.\n\nProblem.\n\nSet t_1 + H -1 = T.\n\nThen y at that time is 9.\n\nIn the down-up path, we have T=60, so t_1 + H -1 =60, 50 + H -1=60, H-1=10, H=11.\n\nThen actions from a_{50} to a_{50+10} = a_{60}.\n\nBut at t=60, if we are at y=9, we can do a_{60}=S.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence, we include it.\n\nFor minimal H, we have H=11.\n\nBut perhaps we can do better.\n\nAnother idea: after t=52, we are at y=1, safe.\n\nInstead of going directly up, we can go to y=0 for safety, but that adds steps.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr, at some point, we can stay to avoid y=6 at dangerous times, but in this case, we pass y=6 after t=55, so no need.\n\nBut let's list all dangerous times again to see if we can pass earlier.\n\nFor y=6, danger at t=54,55.\n\nt=54 and 55 are soon.\n\nFrom t=52, y=1, the earliest we can be at y=6 is t=57, as above.\n\nIf we could be at y=6 before t=54, but from y=1 at t=52, we can be at y=2 at t=53, y=3 at t=54, etc, not before.\n\nSo t=57 is earliest for y=6.\n\nSimilarly, for later rows, no issue.\n\nBut we have to go through y=7 and y=8, which have dangers at t=62-65, but we reach before, so fine.\n\nPerhaps at the beginning, we can go up to y=4 or 5 before t=52, but at t=52, we must not be on 2-5.\n\nFor example, at t=50, a_50=U, y_{51}=4\n\nThen at t=51, y=4, we could go up to y=5, but then at t=52 y=5 dangerous.\n\nOr go down to y=3, dangerous.\n\nOr stay, dangerous.\n\nNo.\n\nIf we go down at t=50 to y=2, then at t=51, y=2, we could go up to y=3, but at t=52 y=3 dangerous.\n\nOnly go down to y=1.\n\nSo I think H=11 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision for other rows.\n\nFor example, on y=7, collisions at t=62,63,64.\n\nBut in our path, we are on y=7 at t=58, which is before, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at t=59.\n\nNow, the car on y=7: first car (-48,-59,right,4), which causes collision at t=62,63,64.\n\nAt t=58, span: T-50=8, s=4, right-moving, span [ -59 +4*8, -48 +4*8] = [ -59+32, -48+32] = [-27, -16], no 0.\n\nSimilarly, second car no issue.\n\ny=8 at t=59: car (-36,-47,right,3), T-50=9, span [ -47 +3*9, -36 +3*9] = [ -47+27, -36+27] = [-20,-9], no 0.\n\nSafe.\n\nSo the path is valid.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to output actions from t=50 to t=60, but at t=60, since y=9, we can do S.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have actions up to a_{59} to set y_{60}=9.\n\nThen for a_{60}, if included, we can do S, but it's not necessary.\n\nBut to match the format, we should include actions until the turn when we reach.\n\nIn the answer, for the last turn, when we reach, we can have action S or something.\n\nBut let's see the format.\n\nThe sequence should end when y=9 at that turn after action.\n\nIn the down-up path, at t=59, we do U to set y_{60}=9.\n\nSo action at t=59 is U.\n\nThen at time t=60, y=9.\n\nNo action needed at t=60.\n\nSo actions from t=50 to t=59.\n\n10 actions.\n\nThen t_1 + H -1 =59, y=9 at t=59? No, at t=59, y=8, before action.\n\nAfter action at t=59, y_{60}=9.\n\nSo at time t=59, position is y_{59}=8.\n\nWe need at time T, y_T=9.\n\nIn this case T=60.\n\nSo for the sequence, actions from a_{50} to a_{59}, for H=10 actions.\n\nThen at time 50 + 10 = t=60, y=9.\n\nt_1 + H = t=60, so t_1 + H -1 =59, but at t=59, y=8, not 9.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTo resolve, I think the position at time t is before the action or after.\n\nAccording to the game dynamics: at turn t, player is at position, then we choose action a_t, then position updates to y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nThen collision is checked at turn t based on y_t and cars at t.\n\nFor the goal, at some turn T, y_T=9.\n\nThen the actions are for turns t=50 to T-1.\n\nNumber of actions H = T - 50.\n\nThen for the sequence, actions from a_{50} to a_{T-1}.\n\nThen at time T, y_T=9.\n\nBut the answer requires at time t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 50 + (T-50) -1 = T-1.\n\nAt time T-1, y_{T-1} is not 9, it's before the last action.\n\nSo there's a mismatch.\n\nPerhaps in the context, the position after the action sequence is at t_1 + H.\n\nI think for this problem, we should output the actions such that after the last action, y=9 at the next turn.\n\nAnd for the box, list the actions for each turn.\n\nIn the down-up path, actions:\n\nTurn 50: D\n\nTurn 51: D\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nThen at turn 60, y=9.\n\nBut we have actions from turn 50 to 59, 10 turns.\n\nH=10.\n\nThen at time t_1 + H -1 = 50 + 10 -1 = 59, at turn 59, we do action U, and after that at t=60 y=9.\n\nBut at time t=59, position is y=8, not 9.\n\nThe requirement is \"at time t_1 + H -1, y=9\", which would require that at the turn when we do the last action, before or after?\n\nI think it's ambiguous.\n\nPerhaps we can consider that after H actions, at time t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nThen t_1 + H -1 is the last action turn.\n\nBut in the position, at time t, it is before action.\n\nLet's assume that at time t_1 + H -1, after the action, y=9.\n\nBut in the update, after action at t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo after action at t, y_{t+1} is the position for t+1.\n\nFor turn t, after action a_t, the position for turn t+1 is set.\n\nThen at turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nFor the goal, at some turn T, y_T=9.\n\nThen the actions to reach are from a_{t1} to a_{T-1}.\n\nThen at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nFor the sequence, we list actions for turns t1 to T-1.\n\nNumber of actions H = T - t1.\n\nThen t1 + H -1 = t1 + (T - t1) -1 = T-1.\n\nAt time t1 + H -1 = T-1, y_{T-1} is not 9, it's the position before action at T-1.\n\nBut after action at T-1, y_T=9.\n\nThe requirement says \"at time t_1 + H -1, y=9\", but at time T-1, y is not 9.\n\nSo it must be that at time t1 + H -1, after the action or something.\n\nI think there's a confusion in the indexing.\n\nPerhaps in this context, the turn when we reach y=9 is t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example in direct up: start t1=50, y=3.\n\nAfter 6 actions: a50 to a55 U, at t56 y=9.\n\nSo at time t56=50+6, y=9.\n\nH=6 actions.\n\nt1 + H -1 = 50+6-1=55, at time 55, y=8, not 9.\n\nNot match.\n\nIf we include the initial position, but no.\n\nI think for the purpose of this problem, we should output the sequence of actions until we reach, and H is the number of actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it lists \"Turn t1: a_t1\" etc, and at the end, after the actions, y=9.\n\nSo for the down-up path, we have 10 actions.\n\nH=10.\n\nThen at time 50+10=60, y=9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =50+10-1=59, at time 59, we do action U, and after that y=9.\n\nBut at time 59, position is y=8.\n\nThe box should list the actions.\n\nPerhaps it's acceptable.\n\nTo minimize H, let's see if we can reach earlier.\n\nAnother idea: since y=9 is safe, and we can go directly if possible.\n\nBut with the t=52 danger, we have to detour.\n\nPerhaps at t=50, we go down to y=2, then at t=51, instead of going down, we go up to y=3, but at t=52 y=3 dangerous.\n\nOr we stay at y=2 at t=52, dangerous.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think H=10 is minimal for this path.\n\nBut let's calculate the time.\n\nStart t=50 y=3\n\nAfter a50=D, t=51 y=2\n\nAfter a51=D, t=52 y=1\n\nAfter a52=U, t=53 y=2\n\nAfter a53=U, t=54 y=3\n\nAfter a54=U, t=55 y=4\n\nAfter a55=U, t=56 y=5\n\nAfter a56=U, t=57 y=6\n\nAfter a57=U, t=58 y=7\n\nAfter a58=U, t=59 y=8\n\nAfter a59=U, t=60 y=9\n\nActions from turn 50 to 59, 10 actions.\n\nH=10.\n\nThen at time t1 + H -1 =50+10-1=59, at turn 59, we do action U, and after that y=9, but at the time of turn 59, position is y=8, and we do U to move to y=9 for turn 60.\n\nBut the requirement is that at time t1+H-1, y=9, which is not true, but perhaps it's the position after the action.\n\nI think we should proceed with the sequence.\n\nPerhaps for y=9, we can reach at turn 59 by being there.\n\nBut from y=3, impossible in 9 turns with detour.\n\nMin from y=3 to y=9 is 6 turns, but with detour to y=1, add 2 turns down, so 8 turns up, total 10 turns.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for the sequence:\n\nTurn 50: D\n\nTurn 51: D\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nThen at turn 60, y=9.\n\nBut for the last action at turn 59, it is included.\n\nH=10.\n\nNow, in the box, list from turn 50 to turn 59.\n\nBut the turn indices: t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, H=10, t from 0 to 9, so turns 50 to 59.\n\nActions: D,D,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U\n\nBut we need to specify for each.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 52, we go U to y=2 at t=53, etc.\n\nAll safe as per collision check.\n\nPerhaps we can have shorter by not going all the way up immediately, but I don't think so.\n\nFor example, after t=52 y=1, we could go to y=0, but that adds steps.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr stay at some point, worse.\n\nSo I think this is minimal H=10.\n\nBut let's confirm H.\n\nNumber of actions: 10.\n\nReach at t=60.\n\nt1 + H = 50+10=60.\n\nIf we define H as number of actions, then at time t1 + H, y=9.\n\nThen t1 + H -1 is the last action turn.\n\nIn the requirement, \"at time t_1 + H -1, y=9\" might be a mistake, or perhaps it's the turn before.\n\nI think for this, we'll go with the sequence.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 50: D\n\nTurn 51: D\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nBut at turn 59, action U, to reach y=9.\n\nNow for the box.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 6, there is a car, and we are on y=6 at t=57, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nPerhaps we can reduce by one if we go faster, but not possible.\n\nAnother thought: at t=50, instead of going down, can we go up to y=4, then at t=51, go down to y=3, but then at t=52, y=3 dangerous.\n\nNo.\n\nOr, from y=3 at t=50, go down to y=2 at t=51, then at t=51, go down to y=1 at t=52, same as before.\n\nNo better.\n\nSo I think H=10 is the answer.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nAlso, the initial turn is t1=50.\n\nSo in the answer:\n\nTurn 50: D\n\nTurn 51: D\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nThen at turn 60, y=9.\n\nH=10.\n\nBut for the box, list the actions.\n\nPerhaps we can stop at turn 59 if we reach at turn 59, but we don't.\n\nUnless we are at y=9 at turn 59.\n\nFrom y=8 at turn 58, after action U at turn 58, y=9 at turn 59.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 50: D\n\nTurn 51: D\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nThen at turn 59, y=9.\n\nHow? After action at turn 58, y_{59}=9.\n\nAt turn 59, position y=9.\n\nThen we don't need action for turn 59.\n\nActions from turn 50 to 58, 9 actions.\n\nH=9.\n\nThen at time t1 + H -1 =50+9-1=58, at turn 58, we do action U, and after that, at turn 59, y=9.\n\nBut at time t=58, during turn 58, position is y=8, we do U, then y=9 for turn 59.\n\nThe requirement is at time t1+H-1, y=9, which is time 58, but at time 58, y=8, not 9.\n\nStill not.\n\nIf we consider that after action at t, position for t+1 is set.\n\nAt time t, position is y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is determined.\n\nFor time t, y_t is fixed before action.\n\nTo have y_T=9 at time T.\n\nThen for time T, no action needed if we are already there, but we start from y=3.\n\nIn this case, with actions from t=50 to t=58, we set y_{59}=9.\n\nSo at time t=59, y=9.\n\nThen H=9 actions.\n\nt1 + H -1 =50+9-1=58, at time 58, y=8, not 9.\n\nBut after the action at t=58, it is set for t=59.\n\nI think we should accept that at time t1+H-1, the position is not 9, but the sequence brings us to 9 at the next turn.\n\nFor the sake of this problem, I'll use the sequence with H=10.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 10.\n\nBut let's list the sequence in the box.\n\nSo for this, the actions are as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 54, we are on y=3 at t=54, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 50\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The collisions are avoided by moving down to \\(y = 1\\) by turn 52 to evade the dangerous rows at turn 52 (where rows \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\) have collisions), and then moving directly up to \\(y = 9\\). The dangerous times for each row are derived from the car states:\n\n- \\(y = 1\\): collision at \\(T = 51\\)\n- \\(y = 2\\): collision at \\(T = 52\\)\n- \\(y = 3\\): collision at \\(T = 52\\)\n- \\(y = 4\\): collision at \\(T = 52\\)\n- \\(y = 5\\): collision at \\(T = 52\\)\n- \\(y = 6\\): collisions at \\(T = 54, 55\\)\n- \\(y = 7\\): collisions at \\(T = 62, 63, 64\\)\n- \\(y = 8\\): collisions at \\(T = 62, 63, 64, 65\\)\n\nThe path must ensure that the player is not on a dangerous row at the corresponding dangerous turn. The minimal sequence involves:\n- Moving down to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 51 (safe, as \\(y = 2\\) is only dangerous at turn 52).\n- Moving down to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 52 (safe, as \\(y = 1\\) is only dangerous at turn 51).\n- Then moving up directly from \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 9\\), reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 60.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns 50 to 59 (10 actions) achieves this, with \\(H = 10\\):\n- At turn 50, action \\(D\\) (down) moves to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 51.\n- At turn 51, action \\(D\\) (down) moves to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 52.\n- From turns 52 to 59, actions \\(U\\) (up) increment \\(y\\) by 1 each turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 60.\n\nThis path avoids all collisions:\n- At turn 52, \\(y = 1\\) is safe (danger only at turn 51).\n- At turns 53–56, \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 5\\) are safe (danger only at turn 52).\n- At turn 57, \\(y = 6\\) is safe (danger at turns 54 and 55, passed).\n- At turns 58 and 59, \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are safe (danger at turns 62–65, not reached).\n\nNo shorter sequence is possible, as the detour to avoid turn 52 collisions requires moving down to \\(y = 1\\), adding turns, and the direct upward path from \\(y = 3\\) would collide at turn 52 on \\(y = 5\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 50: \\ D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 51: \\ D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 52: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 53: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 54: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 55: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 56: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 57: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 58: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 59: \\ U }",

The current turn is t_1 = 53, and I start at y=0.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. Cars move left or right with their speeds, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway y at turn T and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nThe player position updates after the action, so when I move, I'm on the new y only in the next turn. Specifically, at turn T, after action, I'm at y_{T+1}, but for collision, at turn T, I'm considered on y_T for that turn, and I check if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nThe collision rule says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd the note: if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I won't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nBut at turn T, I am on y_T, so I can collide with cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nWhen I take action at turn T, it affects y_{T+1}, but during turn T, I am at position y_T, and that's when the collision check happens for freeway y_T.\n\nThen, after action, I move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nFor the sequence: actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t from 0 to H-1, meaning a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to a_{t_1 + H-1}, and after H actions, I should be at y=9.\n\nStart at turn t_1, position (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0).\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position becomes y_{t_1 +1}, and so on, until after action a_{t_1 + H-1}, position is y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nSince we start at turn t_1, after 0 actions, position is (0,0). After first action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, position is y_{t_1+1}, and so on.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H} = 9, after H actions.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1: a_{t_1 + t}, so after H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nAnd H is the number of turns, which is the number of actions.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nNow, the cars are given at turn t_1=53, with their positions and speeds.\n\nFor each freeway, there are cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right or left, which determines how they move.\n\nFor left-moving, head decreases, for right-moving, head increases.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, at time t, span is [h - s(t - t_1), τ - s(t - t_1)], but since head and tail, for left-moving, head is larger? No.\n\nLook at the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIf [h, τ] and h and τ, for left-moving, since it moves left, decreasing x, so if h is the head, which is, say, the front, then for left-moving, front is decreasing.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and h and τ, which is head and tail.\n\nBut in the example, for freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so it should be moving right, increasing x.\n\nSpan(t_1) = [τ, h] for right-moving? Let's see the rule.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd for left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the car state table, for each car, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor a right-moving car, at t_1, span is [τ, h] with τ ≤ h, I assume.\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nHead h = -48, tail τ = -95.\n\nSince direction right, span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-95, -48], so tail at -95, head at -48, so the car is from -95 to -48, length 47, moving right at speed 48.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nHead h=48, tail τ=83? But if left-moving, span should be [h, τ] = [48,83], but 48 to 83, if moving left, decreasing, but 48 to 83 is increasing x, so that can't be right.\n\nPerhaps I misread.\n\nFreeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so span at t_1 should be [h, τ] = [48, 83]? But 48 to 83 is from left to right, but direction left, meaning moving to decreasing x, so if head is at 48 and tail at 83, that would imply head is left, tail is right, so when moving left, both decrease.\n\nBut [48,83] with 48<83, so min x=48, max x=83.\n\nWhen moving left, at time T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] = [48 - sΔT, 83 - sΔT], so the span shifts left.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, like freeway 1, [τ, h] = [-95, -48], at T, [ -95 + sΔT, -48 + sΔT].\n\nIn general, for any car, the span at time T is an interval [min, max] where min and max depend on direction.\n\nBut for collision, we care about whether 0 is in that interval at time T for the freeway we are on.\n\nNow, the player is at x=0 always, I think, since it's (0,y), so only y changes.\n\nSo collision when on freeway y at turn T, and for some car on y, 0 is in its span at T.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9, but y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think? Freeways are y=1 to y=8, so at y=0 and y=9, no cars, so no collision possible there. Only when on y=1 to 8, I can collide.\n\nStart at (0,0), which is not on a freeway, so no collision at start. Similarly, end at (0,9), no issue.\n\nBut during the path, when I'm on y=1 to 8, I need to avoid times when a car is at x=0 on that freeway.\n\nNow, the actions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same), with y bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nI need to go up to 9, so probably mostly U, but might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nMinimal turns, so I want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, I need to find for each freeway, at what times the car spans contain 0.\n\nSince the cars move continuously in x, but we have discrete turns, and time is in turns.\n\nΔT = T - t_1, with t_1=53.\n\nLet τ = T - t_1, so at relative time τ, from current turn.\n\nFor each freeway, list the cars and when 0 is in their span.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nCar: (h, τ, d, s) = (-48, -95, right, 48)  // head and tail given, but for right-moving, span is [tail, head] = [-95, -48] at τ=0.\n\nd=right, so span at relative time τ: [τ + s τ, h + s τ] = [ -95 + 48τ, -48 + 48τ ]\n\nSet 0 in [ -95 + 48τ, -48 + 48τ ]\n\nSo -95 + 48τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 48τ\n\nFrom -95 + 48τ ≤ 0: 48τ ≤ 95, τ ≤ 95/48 ≈ 1.979\n\nFrom 0 ≤ -48 + 48τ: 48τ ≥ 48, τ ≥ 1\n\nSo τ between 1 and 1.979, so at τ=1 and τ=2? τ is integer? Time is in turns, so T and τ are integers.\n\nT is turn number, so τ = T - t_1 is integer.\n\nτ ≥ 0.\n\nAt τ=1: -95 +48*1 = -95+48= -47, -48+48=0, so span [-47, 0], so 0 is included? 0 ≤ 0 is true, and -47 ≤ 0 true, so yes, 0 in [-47,0].\n\nAt τ=2: -95 +96=1? -95+96=1, -48+96=48, span [1,48], 0 not in [1,48].\n\nAt τ=0: span [-95,-48], 0 not in.\n\nSo at τ=1, 0 is in span, so collision if on y=1 at turn T with τ=1, i.e., T = t_1 +1 = 54.\n\nT = t_1 + τ, so at τ=1, T=54.\n\nFor freeway 1, only at τ=1, which is T=54, 0 is covered.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2\n\nCars: (48, 37, right, 12), and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: (48, 37, right, 12) — head=48, tail=37? But for right-moving, span should be [τ, h] = [37,48] at τ=0.\n\nd=right, so span at τ: [τ + s τ, h + s τ] = [37 + 12τ, 48 + 12τ]\n\nSet 0 in [37+12τ, 48+12τ]\n\n37+12τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 48+12τ? But 37+12τ >0 for τ≥0, so 0 cannot be ≤ 37+12τ since 37+12τ ≥37>0, so 0 not in [37+12τ, 48+12τ] for any τ. So this car never at 0.\n\nSecond car: (0, -11, right, 12) — head=0, tail=-11, d=right, so span at τ=0: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt τ: [ -11 + 12τ, 0 + 12τ ] = [-11 +12τ, 12τ]\n\nSet 0 in [-11+12τ, 12τ]\n\n-11+12τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 12τ\n\nFrom 0 ≤ 12τ, τ ≥0\n\nFrom -11+12τ ≤0, 12τ ≤11, τ ≤ 11/12 ≈0.916\n\nSo τ=0: span [-11,0], 0 in it.\n\nτ=1: -11+12=1, 12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at τ=0, which is T=t_1=53.\n\nBut at T=t_1, we are at y=0, not on freeway 2, so when on y=2, at T, we need to check.\n\nFor freeway 2, at τ=0, T=53, 0 covered, but we are not on it.\n\nAt other times, no coverage.\n\nτ=0 only, so only at T=53, but we are not on y=2 then.\n\nSo for freeway 2, at no time when we might be on it, 0 is covered? τ=0 is past, but for future turns, τ>0, not covered.\n\nτ=0 is now, but we are not on y=2 now.\n\nFor future, τ≥1, -11+12τ ≥ -11+12=1>0, and 12τ>0, so min is at least 1, so 0 never in span for τ≥1. So freeway 2 is always safe? But let's confirm.\n\nAt τ=0, covered, but not relevant.\n\nFor τ≥1, span min: -11+12τ ≥1, max=12τ≥12, so [1,12] or larger, all >0, so 0 not in, yes. So freeway 2 has no car at 0 for any future turn. So we can be on y=2 at any time without collision.\n\nBut freeway 2 has two cars, but the first one never at 0, second only at τ=0, so yes.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3\n\nCars: same as freeway 2? (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nExactly the same as freeway 2.\n\nSo similarly, only at τ=0 covered, but not for future, so freeway 3 is always safe.\n\nFreeway 4: y=4\n\nCar: (48,83,left,36) — head=48, tail=83, d=left.\n\nFor left-moving, span at τ=0: [h, τ] = [48,83]\n\nAt τ: [h - s τ, τ - s τ] = [48 - 36τ, 83 - 36τ]\n\nSet 0 in [48-36τ, 83-36τ]\n\nSo 48-36τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 83-36τ\n\nFrom 0 ≤ 83-36τ: 36τ ≤83, τ ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nFrom 48-36τ ≤0: 48 ≤ 36τ, τ ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333\n\nSo τ between 1.333 and 2.305, so τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2: 48-72= -24, 83-72=11, span [-24,11], 0 in it.\n\nAt τ=1: 48-36=12, 83-36=47, [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nτ=2: -24 to 11, 0 in.\n\nτ=3: 48-108= -60, 83-108= -25, [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at τ=2, T= t_1 +2 =55.\n\nFreeway 5: y=5\n\nCar: (48,83,left,36) same as freeway 4? But freeway 5 has same car? (48,83,left,36)\n\nExactly same, so same as above, only at τ=2, T=55, 0 covered.\n\nFreeway 6: y=6\n\nCar: (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nd=right, so span at τ=0: [τ, h] = [-59, -48] since tail and head, [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt τ: [ -59 +6τ, -48 +6τ]\n\nSet 0 in [-59+6τ, -48+6τ]\n\n-59+6τ ≤0 and 0 ≤ -48+6τ\n\nFrom 0 ≤ -48+6τ: 6τ ≥48, τ ≥8\n\nFrom -59+6τ ≤0: 6τ ≤59, τ ≤59/6≈9.833\n\nSo τ from 8 to 9.833, so τ=8,9.\n\nAt τ=8: -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nAt τ=9: -59+54= -5? -59+54= -5, -48+54=6, span [-5,6], 0 in? -5≤0≤6 yes.\n\nAt τ=10: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo at τ=8 and τ=9, T= t_1+8=61, t_1+9=62.\n\nt_1=53, so T=53+8=61, 53+9=62.\n\nFreeway 7: y=7\n\nCars: (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4)\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) — d=right, span at τ=0: [τ,h] = [37,48]\n\nAt τ: [37+4τ, 48+4τ], min 37>0, so 0 never in.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,4) — span at τ=0: [-11,0]\n\nAt τ: [-11+4τ, 0+4τ] = [-11+4τ, 4τ]\n\nSet 0 in [-11+4τ, 4τ]\n\n-11+4τ ≤0 and 0 ≤4τ\n\n0≤4τ always for τ≥0.\n\n-11+4τ≤0: 4τ≤11, τ≤11/4=2.75\n\nSo τ=0,1,2 since τ integer.\n\nτ=0: [-11,0], 0 in\n\nτ=1: [-11+4,4] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nτ=2: [-11+8,8] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nτ=3: [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo at τ=0,1,2, T=53,54,55.\n\nBut we are concerned with future turns, τ≥1? τ=0 is now, but we are not on y=7 now.\n\nFor collision when on y=7 at T, which for τ≥1.\n\nAt τ=1, T=54; τ=2, T=55; 0 covered.\n\nτ=3 and above not covered.\n\nFreeway 8: y=8\n\nCar: (-48, -59, right, 3) — similar to freeway 6 but different speed.\n\nd=right, span at τ=0: [τ,h] = [-59, -48]? Head and tail, for right-moving, [tail, head] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt τ: [-59 +3τ, -48 +3τ]\n\nSet 0 in [-59+3τ, -48+3τ]\n\n-59+3τ ≤0 and 0 ≤ -48+3τ\n\n0 ≤ -48+3τ: 3τ ≥48, τ≥16\n\n-59+3τ ≤0: 3τ ≤59, τ≤59/3≈19.666\n\nSo τ from 16 to 19.666, so τ=16,17,18,19.\n\nAt τ=16: -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, span [-11,0], 0 in\n\nτ=17: -59+51= -8, -48+51=3, [-8,3], 0 in\n\nτ=18: -59+54= -5, -48+54=6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nτ=19: -59+57= -2, -48+57=9, [-2,9], 0 in\n\nτ=20: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], no\n\nSo at τ=16 to 19, T=53+16=69 to 53+19=72.\n\nNow, summarize the dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: dangerous at τ=1 (T=54)\n\n- y=2: always safe\n\n- y=3: always safe\n\n- y=4: dangerous at τ=2 (T=55)\n\n- y=5: dangerous at τ=2 (T=55)\n\n- y=6: dangerous at τ=8,9 (T=61,62)\n\n- y=7: dangerous at τ=1,2 (T=54,55)\n\n- y=8: dangerous at τ=16,17,18,19 (T=69 to 72)\n\nWe start at y=0, turn t_1=53, position (0,0).\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nActions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same).\n\ny must be in [0,9].\n\nWe want minimal H such that after H actions, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and need to go to y=9, the minimal number of actions without any obstacles would be 9 Ups, but we have to avoid dangerous times on the freeways.\n\nBut we can stay or move down to wait, but that increases H.\n\nH is the number of turns, so we want to minimize the time to reach y=9.\n\nSince we have to increase y from 0 to 9, and each U increases by 1, we need at least 9 actions of U, but we can have S or D which don't help, so minimal H is at least 9, but with obstacles, it might be more.\n\nH actions, from y=0 to y=9, each U increases y by 1, D decreases, S same, so to increase by 9, net U must be 9 more than D, so number of U minus number of D =9.\n\nTotal actions H = U + D + S.\n\ny_final - y_initial = (number of U) - (number of D) =9.\n\nSo U - D =9.\n\nH = U + D + S.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to minimize S and D, so ideally all U, H=9.\n\nBut if we have to avoid, we might need to wait, so S or D to stay at safe y or move to safe y.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe dangerous freeways are y=1,4,5,6,7,8 at certain times, but y=2 and y=3 are always safe, so we can be there any time.\n\ny=2 and y=3 are safe havens.\n\nNow, let's list the dangerous times again:\n\n- At T=54 (τ=1): y=1 and y=7 dangerous (from above)\n\nT=54: y=1 dangerous (τ=1), and y=7 dangerous (τ=1)\n\nAlso at T=55 (τ=2): y=4, y=5, y=7 dangerous\n\ny=7 dangerous at τ=1 and 2, T=54 and 55.\n\ny=4 and y=5 dangerous only at τ=2, T=55.\n\nThen later, y=6 dangerous at T=61,62\n\ny=8 dangerous at T=69-72, but that might be later, and since we want minimal H, probably we can reach before that, so we might not need to worry about y=8 if we go fast.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at T=61,62, if we can reach before τ=8, we avoid.\n\nτ=8 is T=53+8=61.\n\nNow, from start, at turn t_1=53, we are at y=0.\n\nWe need to take actions starting from a_{53}, a_{54}, etc.\n\nLet me denote the turn sequence.\n\nTurn 53: position y=0\n\nAction a_{53}: can be U, D, S.\n\nIf U, go to y=1 at turn 54.\n\nBut at turn 54, if we are on y=1, it is dangerous, because at T=54, y=1 has car at 0.\n\nCollision at turn T if on freeway y_T and 0 covered.\n\nAt turn 53: we are at y=0, not on freeway, no collision.\n\nAfter action a_{53}, at turn 54, we are at y_{54}.\n\nIf we take U at turn 53, then y_{54} = y_{53} +1 = 0+1=1.\n\nThen at turn 54, we are on y=1, and at T=54, y=1 has 0 covered, so collision. Not good.\n\nIf we take S at turn 53, y_{54}=0, still at y=0, safe.\n\nIf D, y_{54}= -1, but y must be >=0, so D from y=0 not possible, I think? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0, D would make y_{t+1}= -1, not allowed, so from y=0, cannot do D, only U or S.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, cannot do U.\n\nSo at y=0, actions possible: U or S.\n\nAt turn 53, if we do S, we stay at y=0 for turn 54.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nIf we do U at turn 53, we go to y=1 at turn 54, but collision.\n\nSo we cannot go to y=1 at turn 54.\n\nTherefore, at turn 53, we should not do U; we must do S to stay at y=0.\n\nThen at turn 54, we are still at y=0.\n\nNow, turn 54: position y=0.\n\nAction a_{54}: U or S.\n\nIf U, go to y=1 at turn 55.\n\nNow, at turn 55, what is dangerous?\n\nT=55 (τ=2), dangerous freeways: y=4, y=5, y=7.\n\ny=1 at T=55: is it dangerous? For y=1, dangerous only at τ=1, T=54, not at T=55.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 dangerous at T=54 and 55.\n\nBut at turn 55, if we go to y=1, y=1 is not dangerous at T=55.\n\nAt T=55, we are on y_{55}.\n\nIf we take U at turn 54, y_{55} =1.\n\nThen at turn 55, we are on y=1, and for y=1 at T=55, is there a car? From above, y=1 dangerous only at T=54, not at T=55. So at T=55, y=1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 is dangerous at T=55.\n\nBut we are at y=1, not y=7.\n\nSo if at turn 54 we do U, to y=1 at turn 55, safe.\n\nWe could do S at turn 54, stay at y=0, but that delays.\n\nNow, after that, we need to go to higher y.\n\nBut there is danger at T=55 on y=4,5,7.\n\nSince we are at y=1 at turn 55, we can move up.\n\nBut let's list the position over time.\n\nWe need to plan the path.\n\nSince y=2 and y=3 are always safe, we can go through them quickly.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on dangerous freeways at dangerous times.\n\nNow, the critical times are near: T=54 and T=55.\n\nSpecifically, we cannot be on y=1 at T=54, or on y=7 at T=54 or T=55, or on y=4 or y=5 at T=55.\n\nBut since we start from below, we might not be on y=4,5,7 immediately.\n\nAt turn 53: position y=0\n\nAction: must S, because if U, go to y=1 at T=54, collision.\n\nSo a_{53} = S\n\nThen turn 54: position y=0\n\nAction a_{54}: now can U or S.\n\nIf S, stay y=0, but delay.\n\nIf U, go to y=1 at turn 55.\n\nAt turn 55, position y=1 (if we did U at 54)\n\nNow, at turn 55, T=55, we are on y=1, which is safe at T=55.\n\nNow, action at turn 55: can U, D, S.\n\nIf U, go to y=2 at turn 56.\n\ny=2 is always safe, so no problem.\n\nBut let's see what happens if we go directly.\n\nWe can go up to y=3 quickly.\n\ny=3 is always safe.\n\nBut there is danger at T=55 on y=4,5,7, but we are not there yet.\n\nAt turn 55, position y=1.\n\nIf we do U at turn 55, go to y=2 at turn 56.\n\nThen at turn 56, position y=2.\n\nAction U, go to y=3 at turn 57.\n\nThen turn 57, position y=3.\n\nAction U, go to y=4 at turn 58.\n\nNow, at turn 58, T=58, position y=4.\n\nIs y=4 dangerous at T=58?\n\ny=4 dangerous only at τ=2, T=55, which is past, so at T=58, safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can continue up.\n\nBut y=5 dangerous only at T=55, past.\n\ny=6 dangerous at T=61,62, which is future.\n\nT=58 is τ=5, since t_1=53, τ=T-t_1.\n\nT=58, τ=5.\n\ny=6 dangerous at τ=8,9, T=61,62, so at T=58, not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 dangerous at τ=1,2, T=54,55, so at T=58, safe.\n\ny=8 dangerous later.\n\nSo if we go up steadily, we can reach y=9 quickly.\n\nBut let's see the timing.\n\nStart:\n\nTurn 53 (T=53): y=0, action S (must, to avoid going to y=1 at T=54)\n\nAfter action S, at turn 54, y=0.\n\nTurn 54: y=0, action U, go to y=1 at turn 55.\n\nTurn 55: y=1, action U, go to y=2 at turn 56.\n\nTurn 56: y=2, action U, go to y=3 at turn 57.\n\nTurn 57: y=3, action U, go to y=4 at turn 58.\n\nTurn 58: y=4, action U, go to y=5 at turn 59.\n\nTurn 59: y=5, action U, go to y=6 at turn 60.\n\nTurn 60: y=6, action U, go to y=7 at turn 61.\n\nNow, at turn 61, y=7, T=61.\n\ny=7 dangerous at τ=1,2 (T=54,55), which are past, so at T=61, τ=8, y=7 is safe? From above, y=7 dangerous only at τ=1,2, so for τ=8, not dangerous.\n\nBut y=6 is dangerous at τ=8,9, T=61,62.\n\nAt turn 60, we are at y=6? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 60: position y=6? From above:\n\nAfter action at turn 59: we go to y=6 at turn 60.\n\nTurn 59: y=5, action U, so at turn 60, y=6.\n\nThen at turn 60, T=60, we are on y=6.\n\nNow, y=6 dangerous at T=61 and 62? T=60 is τ=7, since t_1=53, T=60, τ=7.\n\ny=6 dangerous at τ=8,9, so at τ=7, not dangerous.\n\nAt τ=7, T=60, y=6: span for car, earlier, at τ=7: -59 +6*7 = -59+42= -17, -48+42= -6? For freeway 6, car: [-59+6τ, -48+6τ]\n\nAt τ=7: -59+42= -17, -48+42= -6, span [-17,-6], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nAt τ=8: -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, span [-11,0], 0 in, dangerous.\n\nSimilarly at τ=9: [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nSo at T=60, τ=7, y=6 safe.\n\nThen at turn 60, we are on y=6, safe.\n\nAction: we do U, go to y=7 at turn 61.\n\nTurn 61: position y=7, T=61.\n\nNow T=61, τ=8.\n\ny=7: dangerous only at τ=1,2, so at τ=8, not dangerous. Safe.\n\nThen action U, go to y=8 at turn 62.\n\nTurn 62: position y=8, T=62.\n\ny=8 dangerous at τ=16 to 19, T=69 to 72, τ=8 is T=61? τ=8 is T=53+8=61.\n\nT=62, τ=9.\n\ny=8 dangerous at τ=16,17,18,19, so at τ=9, not dangerous. Safe.\n\nThen action U, go to y=9 at turn 63.\n\nTurn 63: position y=9, done.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at turn 63.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 53 to turn 63? Let's list the actions and positions.\n\nTurn | position at start | action | position after action (next turn)\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, take action a_T, then position at turn T+1 is y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, we are on y_T, and check for that T and y_T.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n- Turn 53: y_53 = 0, action S → y_54 = 0\n\n- Turn 54: y_54 = 0, action U → y_55 = 1\n\n- Turn 55: y_55 = 1, action U → y_56 = 2\n\n- Turn 56: y_56 = 2, action U → y_57 = 3\n\n- Turn 57: y_57 = 3, action U → y_58 = 4\n\n- Turn 58: y_58 = 4, action U → y_59 = 5\n\n- Turn 59: y_59 = 5, action U → y_60 = 6\n\n- Turn 60: y_60 = 6, action U → y_61 = 7\n\n- Turn 61: y_61 = 7, action U → y_62 = 8\n\n- Turn 62: y_62 = 8, action U → y_63 = 9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt each turn, position and whether collision.\n\nTurn 53: y=0, not freeway, no collision.\n\nTurn 54: y=0, not freeway, no collision.\n\nTurn 55: y=1, T=55, but y=1 dangerous only at T=54, not T=55. At T=55, y=1 safe, as span moved.\n\nTurn 56: y=2, always safe.\n\nTurn 57: y=3, always safe.\n\nTurn 58: y=4, T=58, τ=5, y=4 dangerous only at τ=2, T=55, so safe.\n\nTurn 59: y=5, T=59, τ=6, dangerous only at τ=2, safe.\n\nTurn 60: y=6, T=60, τ=7, dangerous at τ=8,9, not now, safe. Span at τ=7: for y=6, [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nTurn 61: y=7, T=61, τ=8, dangerous only at τ=1,2, so safe.\n\nTurn 62: y=8, T=62, τ=9, dangerous at τ=16-19, not now, safe.\n\nThen at turn 63, y=9, done, not freeway.\n\nWe have H actions? From turn 53 to turn 62, we have 10 actions: a53 to a62, and after a62, we are at y63=9.\n\nActions: t=0 to H-1, a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt1=53, actions a53, a54, ..., a_{t1 + H-1}, and y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nHere, after a62, y63=9, so t1 + H =63, t1=53, so H=10.\n\nActions: from t=0 to 9, a53 to a62.\n\nWe started with S at 53, then U from 54 to 62 except 53 is S.\n\na53=S, a54=U, a55=U, ..., up to a62=U.\n\nNumber of actions: 10, to reach at turn 63.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nEarlier I thought minimal H=9, but with obstacles, we had to wait one turn.\n\nAt turn 53, we had to do S to avoid going to y=1 at T=54.\n\nCould we have gone up earlier?\n\nAt turn 53, if we do nothing, we stay, but we need to go to y=9.\n\nSuppose we do U at turn 53, but then at turn 54, y=1, T=54, collision, not possible.\n\nSo we must not be on y=1 at T=54.\n\nTherefore, at turn 53, we cannot do U; must do S.\n\nThen at turn 54, we do U to go to y=1 at T=55, which is safe.\n\nThen we go up.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we have 10 actions.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9, with 9 Ups, but we have one S, so 10 actions.\n\nCan we do with 9 actions?\n\nWith 9 actions, we must have exactly 9 Ups and 0 Downs, since U-D=9, and H=9, so U=9, D=0, S=0.\n\nBut if we do U all the way, starting from turn 53.\n\na53: U, to y=1 at turn 54 → collision at T=54 on y=1.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf we start later, but we have to start at turn 53.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=2 or something, but from y=0, first action must be U to go to y=1, but at T=54, it is dangerous.\n\nUnless we can be at y=1 at a different time, but T=54 is the only dangerous time for y=1.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=1 at T=54.\n\nTherefore, with H=9, we would need to be at y=1 at some turn, but if we start U at turn 53, we are at y=1 at turn 54, collision.\n\nIf we do S first, then U, we are at y=1 later, but with H=9, if we do one S, then 8 U, but from y=0, after S, still y=0, then 8 U to y=8, not to y=9.\n\ny_final = y_initial + (U - D) = 0 + U - D.\n\nSet to 9, so U - D =9.\n\nWith H=9, U + D + S =9, U - D =9.\n\nThen from U - D =9 and U + D + S =9, add: 2U + S =18, subtract: 2D + S =0, so D=0, S=0, U=9.\n\nSo only possible with exactly 9 U, no S or D.\n\nBut then we must go from y=0 to y=9 in 9 steps: y_54=1, y_55=2, ..., y_62=8, y_63=9? After 9 actions, y_{t1 +9}.\n\nt1=53, after a_{53} to a_{61}, y_{62}.\n\nSet y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H.\n\nStart at turn t1, position before action.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nWith H actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, and y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nFor H=9: actions a_{53} to a_{61}, y_{62} =9.\n\nBut to reach y_{62}=9, we need to have y_{62} = y_{61} + Δy_{61}, but y_{62} =9.\n\nThe sequence: from y_{53}=0, after a_{53}, y_{54} = y_{53} + Δy_{53}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{61}, y_{62} = y_{61} + Δy_{61} =9.\n\nSince U - D =9 for the changes.\n\nFor H=9, y_{62} must be 9.\n\ny_{54} to y_{62} must be set.\n\nSpecifically, at turn 54, y_{54} must be set, and so on.\n\nNow, y_{54} cannot be 1, because if y_{54}=1, then at turn 54, T=54, on y=1, collision.\n\nIf we go directly, y_{54} should be 1 if we do U at 53.\n\nBut collision.\n\nIf we do not do U at 53, but at H=9, we must start U immediately, but cannot.\n\nSuppose y_{54} is not 1, but from y_{53}=0, if a_{53}=S, then y_{54}=0, but then to reach y_{62}=9, we need to increase by 9 in 8 steps? From y_{54} to y_{62}, that's 8 steps? Turns: y_{54} to y_{55}, ..., y_{62}, that's 8 intervals, but 8 actions? Let's see the indices.\n\nPosition y_{t} at turn t.\n\nAfter action at t, position at t+1.\n\nFrom turn t1=53, after H actions, at turn t1 + H.\n\ny_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nWith H=9, y_{62} =9.\n\ny_{62} is determined by actions from a_{53} to a_{61}.\n\nThe values y_{54} to y_{62} are set, but y_{53} is fixed.\n\ny_{54} = y_{53} + Δy_{53}\n\ny_{55} = y_{54} + Δy_{54} = y_{53} + Δy_{53} + Δy_{54}\n\n...\n\ny_{62} = y_{53} + sum_{k=53}^{61} Δy_k = 0 + (U - D) for those actions.\n\nSince U - D =9, y_{62}=9.\n\nNow, the collision depends on y_t for t from 54 to 61? From turn t1 to t1 + H -1, but collision at turn T when we are on y_T.\n\nIn the path, we are on turn T for T from t1 to t1 + H -1, since at turn t1 + H, we reach y=9, which is safe, and we don't care after, but during the actions, we are on turns t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nFor H=9, we are on turns 53 to 61.\n\nAt each turn T from 53 to 61, we are on y_T, and must not collide.\n\nAt T=53: y_{53}=0, safe.\n\nAt T=54: y_{54}, must be safe. But at T=54, dangerous freeways: y=1 and y=7.\n\nSo y_{54} cannot be 1 or 7.\n\nSimilarly, at T=55: dangerous y=4,5,7, so y_{55} cannot be 4,5, or 7.\n\nNow, for H=9, y_{62}=9.\n\nWe need to set y_t for t=54 to 61? y_t for the turns.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nFor T from 53 to 61, y_T must be safe at that T.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nT=53: y=0, safe\n\nT=54: y_{54} must not be 1 or 7\n\nT=55: y_{55} must not be 4,5,7\n\nT=56 to 61: need to be safe, but no immediate danger except later, but for now.\n\ny_{54} cannot be 1 or 7.\n\nBut y_{54} = y_{53} + Δy_{53} = 0 + Δy_{53}\n\nΔy_{53} can be 0 or +1 (since cannot D).\n\nSo y_{54} can be 0 or 1.\n\nBut cannot be 1, so must be 0. Thus Δy_{53} =0, a_{53}=S.\n\nThen y_{54}=0.\n\nNow T=54: y_{54}=0, safe.\n\nNow at T=55: y_{55} must not be 4,5,7.\n\ny_{55} = y_{54} + Δy_{54} = 0 + Δy_{54}, so y_{55} can be 0 or 1.\n\nNeither 4,5,7, so both possible, but 0 or 1.\n\nNow, we need to reach y_{62}=9.\n\ny_{62} = y_{55} + sum_{k=55}^{61} Δy_k\n\nSince y_{55} is 0 or 1, and we need y_{62}=9, so the sum from k=55 to 61 must be 9 - y_{55}, which is 9 or 8.\n\nNumber of actions from a_{55} to a_{61}, that's 7 actions (t=55 to 61).\n\nAfter a_{61}, y_{62}.\n\nActions: a_{55}, a_{56}, ..., a_{61}, 7 actions.\n\nThe changes Δy_{55} to Δy_{61}, each +1,0,-1.\n\ny_{62} = y_{55} + Δy_{55} + ... + Δy_{61}\n\nSet to 9.\n\ny_{55} is 0 or 1.\n\nSo sum of 7 changes must be 9 - y_{55}, which is at least 8, at most 9.\n\nEach change <= +1, so maximum increase in 7 steps is +7, but 9 - y_{55} >=8 >7, impossible.\n\ny_{55} <=1, so 9 - y_{55} >=8.\n\nBut with 7 actions, the maximum y_{62} can be is y_{55} +7.\n\ny_{55} <=1, so y_{62} <=1+7=8 <9, cannot reach 9.\n\nIf y_{55}=1, y_{62} <=1+7=8<9.\n\nIf y_{55}=0, y_{62} <=0+7=7<9.\n\nBut we need y_{62}=9, impossible with 7 actions from y_{55}.\n\nTherefore, for H=9, it is impossible to reach y_{62}=9 because we must have y_{54}=0, so y_{55} <=1, and then only 7 actions to increase to 9, but max increase 7, so y_{62} <= y_{55} +7 <=1+7=8<9.\n\nHence, H=9 is impossible.\n\nThus minimal H is at least 10.\n\nIn our earlier sequence, we have H=10, reaching at turn 63.\n\nBut in that sequence, we used one S and nine U, so U=9, D=0, S=1, H=10.\n\nNow, can we reach with H=10 but earlier?\n\nIn our sequence, we have one S at the beginning.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster or avoid waiting.\n\nBut since y=2 and y=3 are safe, we can go through them.\n\nIn our sequence, we reached y=9 at turn 63.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach earlier with H=10.\n\nH=10 means y_{t1 +10} = y_{63} =9.\n\nAfter 10 actions, at turn 63.\n\nThe actions are from a53 to a62.\n\nWe need y63=9.\n\nThe turns we are on: from T=53 to T=62.\n\ny_T for T=53 to 62 must be safe.\n\nT=53: y=0 safe\n\nT=54: y must not be 1 or 7\n\nT=55: y must not be 4,5,7\n\nT=56 to 62: need to be safe, but no other dangers except y=6 at T=61,62, and y=8 later, but T=62 is within.\n\nFirst, at T=54, y54 cannot be 1 or 7.\n\ny54 = y53 + Δy53 = 0 + Δy53, so Δy53 =0 or +1.\n\nIf Δy53=0, y54=0\n\nIf Δy53=1, y54=1, but cannot be 1, so must Δy53=0, y54=0.\n\nThus a53=S.\n\ny54=0.\n\nNow T=54: y=0 safe.\n\nNow at T=55: y55 cannot be 4,5,7.\n\ny55 = y54 + Δy54 = 0 + Δy54, so y55=0 or 1.\n\nNeither 4,5,7, so both ok.\n\nNow, we need to reach y63=9.\n\ny63 = y55 + sum_{k=55}^{62} Δy_k\n\ny55 is 0 or 1.\n\nNumber of Δy from k=55 to 62: 8 actions.\n\ny63 = y55 + sum_{k=55}^{62} Δy_k =9\n\nSo sum of 8 changes = 9 - y55\n\nIf y55=0, sum=9, so need +9 in 8 actions, possible only if all +1, but 8 actions, max +8, +9 impossible. Each Δy <=+1, so sum <= +8, but need +9, impossible if y55=0.\n\ny63 = y55 + (U - D) for k=55 to 62.\n\nSet to 9.\n\ny55 <=1.\n\nU - D <= number of U, but with 8 actions, U - D <=8.\n\nIf y55=0, then U - D =9, but max U - D <=8 with 8 actions, impossible.\n\nIf y55=1, then U - D =8, which is possible with U=8, D=0, or U=9,D=1, etc., but U - D=8.\n\nWith 8 actions, U - D =8 implies U=8, D=0, S=0.\n\nNow, y55=1.\n\nThen we need y55=1.\n\nFrom above, y55 = y54 + Δy54 =0 + Δy54, so Δy54 must be +1, so a54=U, then y55=1.\n\nNow, at T=55, y55=1, which is not 4,5,7, so safe.\n\nThen we need to go from y55=1 to y63=9 in 8 actions, with U=8, D=0, S=0, so all U.\n\nThen sequence: a55=U, y56=2\n\na56=U, y57=3\n\na57=U, y58=4\n\na58=U, y59=5\n\na59=U, y60=6\n\na60=U, y61=7\n\na61=U, y62=8\n\na62=U, y63=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nT=55: y55=1, safe as before.\n\nT=56: y56=2, always safe.\n\nT=57: y57=3, always safe.\n\nT=58: y58=4, T=58, τ=5, safe, not dangerous time.\n\nT=59: y59=5, T=59, τ=6, safe.\n\nT=60: y60=6, T=60, τ=7, y=6 dangerous at τ=8,9, not now, safe.\n\nT=61: y61=7, T=61, τ=8, y=7 dangerous at τ=1,2, not now, safe.\n\nT=62: y62=8, T=62, τ=9, y=8 dangerous at τ=16-19, not now, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nAnd H=10, same as before, but we reached earlier? In this sequence, we have actions from a53 to a62.\n\na53=S, a54=U, a55=U, ..., a62=U.\n\nCompared to the first sequence: in first sequence I had a53=S, a54=U, a55=U, ..., a62=U, same as this.\n\nIn this, y63=9, after a62.\n\nIn the first sequence I listed, I had up to a62=U to y63=9.\n\nIn the path, at T=61, y61=7? In this sequence:\n\nAfter a60: y61=7 (since a60=U from y60=6 to y61=7)\n\nTurn 60: position y60=6, action U, so at turn 61, y61=7.\n\nThen at turn 61, T=61, y61=7, safe.\n\nThen action a61=U, go to y62=8 at turn 62.\n\nTurn 62: position y62=8, action U, go to y63=9.\n\nIn terms of turns on freeway: at T=61, we are on y61=7.\n\nIn the sequence above, y61=7 at T=61, which is fine.\n\nNow, but we have y=6 at T=60 and T=61? In this sequence:\n\nAt T=60: y60=6\n\nT=61: y61=7\n\ny=6 dangerous at T=61 and 62? T=61 is τ=8.\n\ny=6 dangerous at τ=8 and 9, T=61 and 62.\n\nAt T=60, τ=7, y=6 safe.\n\nAt T=61, we are on y61=7, not y=6.\n\nAt T=61, on y=7, which is safe.\n\nAt T=62, on y=8, safe.\n\nSo y=6 is only at T=60, which is safe, since τ=7.\n\nNo problem.\n\nIn this sequence, with H=10, we have a53=S, a54=U, a55=U, a56=U, a57=U, a58=U, a59=U, a60=U, a61=U, a62=U.\n\nAfter a62, y63=9.\n\nThe actions: from t=0 to 9, a_{53} to a_{62}.\n\nIn the sequence, we have one S and nine U.\n\nIs there a way with H=10 but without the initial S? But we must have S at beginning to avoid collision.\n\nPerhaps we can go down or something, but not necessary.\n\nSince y=2 and y=3 are safe, but we go through them fast.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=1 at T=55, which is fine.\n\nNow, but we have y=7 at T=61, which is safe.\n\nBut earlier I thought about y=6 at T=61, but we are not on it then.\n\nIn this sequence, all safe, and H=10.\n\nCan we reach with H=10 but at an earlier turn? No, because we start at turn 53, and after 10 actions, at turn 63.\n\nThe turn we reach is fixed for H, but H is the number of turns, we want min H.\n\nH=10 is minimal since H=9 impossible.\n\nIn the sequence, we used 10 actions.\n\nThe answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to output actions from turn t1.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=53.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 53: S\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nAfter that, at turn 63, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions H=10.\n\nIn the output, it should be up to a_{t1 + H-1} = a_{62}.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, a_{t1 + t}.\n\nHere t from 0 to 9, a53 to a62.\n\nIn the box, we need to write:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nWith H=10.\n\nt_1=53, so:\n\nTurn 53: S\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\n...\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nBut let's write all.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 7, it has two cars, but we considered only the second one, but the first one never at 0, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nIn the beginning, for freeway 2 and 3, always safe, we used them.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=2 at T=56, y=3 at T=57, both safe.\n\nIs there a shorter path? H=10 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can reach in fewer actions by going down, but that would require more actions or same.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=0 and stay, but that increases H.\n\nOr, to avoid y=7 at dangerous times, but in this case, we are not on it at T=54 or 55.\n\nIn fact, we are on y=7 at T=61, which is safe.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, at T=55, we are on y=1, which is safe.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's list all y_T and times:\n\nT=53: y=0\n\nT=54: y=0 (after S)\n\nT=55: y=1\n\nT=56: y=2\n\nT=57: y=3\n\nT=58: y=4\n\nT=59: y=5\n\nT=60: y=6\n\nT=61: y=7\n\nT=62: y=8\n\nAll safe as per earlier.\n\nNo collisions.\n\nThus minimal H=10.\n\nThe sequence of actions.\n\nIn the output, it should be for the turns.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 53: S\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\nTurn 57: U\nTurn 58: U\nTurn 59: U\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: U\n}\n\nBut the last action is at turn 62, to go to y=9 at turn 63.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 10 actions.\n\nTo write it clearly.\n\nSince t_1=53, we can write:\n\nTurn t_1: S  \nTurn t_1 + 1: U  \nTurn t_1 + 2: U  \n...  \nTurn t_1 + 9: U  \n\nt from 0 to 9, t_1 + t for t=0 to 9.\n\nt_1 + 0 =53, t_1 +1=54, ..., t_1 +9=62.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in the box.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 3, it has the same cars as freeway 2, but we didn't use it dangerously.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 53\\) is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by waiting at \\(y = 0\\) for one turn to avoid the collision on \\(y = 1\\) at turn 54, then moving up directly to \\(y = 9\\).\n\n### Collision Analysis Summary:\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Dangerous at turn 54 (relative time \\(\\tau = 1\\)).\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Always safe.\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Always safe.\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Dangerous at turn 55 (\\(\\tau = 2\\)).\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Dangerous at turn 55 (\\(\\tau = 2\\)).\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Dangerous at turns 61 and 62 (\\(\\tau = 8, 9\\)).\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Dangerous at turns 54 and 55 (\\(\\tau = 1, 2\\)).\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Dangerous at turns 69 to 72 (\\(\\tau = 16\\) to \\(19\\)), but these are beyond the minimal path.\n\n### Path Explanation:\n- At turn 53, starting at \\(y = 0\\), action \\(S\\) (stay) is taken to avoid moving to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 54, where a collision would occur.\n- From turn 54 onwards, actions \\(U\\) (up) are taken consecutively to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 63.\n- The path is safe because:\n  - At turn 55 (\\(y = 1\\)), freeway 1 is safe (dangerous only at turn 54).\n  - Freeways 2 and 3 are always safe.\n  - At turns 58 and 59 (\\(y = 4\\) and \\(y = 5\\)), freeways 4 and 5 are safe (dangerous only at turn 55).\n  - At turn 60 (\\(y = 6\\)), freeway 6 is safe (dangerous at turns 61 and 62, but at turn 60, \\(\\tau = 7\\), safe).\n  - At turn 61 (\\(y = 7\\)), freeway 7 is safe (dangerous at turns 54 and 55).\n  - At turn 62 (\\(y = 8\\)), freeway 8 is safe (dangerous after turn 68).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t}\\}_{t=53}^{62}\\) is:\n- Turn 53: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 0\\) to avoid collision at turn 54 on \\(y = 1\\))\n- Turn 54: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 55, safe)\n- Turn 55: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 56, safe)\n- Turn 56: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 57, safe)\n- Turn 57: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 58, safe)\n- Turn 58: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 59, safe)\n- Turn 59: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 60, safe)\n- Turn 60: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 61, safe)\n- Turn 61: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 62, safe)\n- Turn 62: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 63, goal reached)\n\nAfter 10 actions, at turn 63, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 53: S \\\\\nTurn 54: U \\\\\nTurn 55: U \\\\\nTurn 56: U \\\\\nTurn 57: U \\\\\nTurn 58: U \\\\\nTurn 59: U \\\\\nTurn 60: U \\\\\nTurn 61: U \\\\\nTurn 62: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. I start at y=0 at turn t₁=54.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each freeway, there are cars with positions given at turn t₁. The position is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). Direction is \"left\" or \"right\", which I think means the direction of movement.\n\nFor left-moving cars, the span moves left as time increases, so at time T, span is [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)] for a car that at t₁ was from h to τ. Similarly for right-moving, it moves right.\n\nCollision happens only if at the turn when I'm on a freeway, the car's span includes x=0 at that exact turn. And importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from turn 54 onwards to reach y=9 as quickly as possible without colliding.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each future turn and for which turns they occupy x=0 on their freeway.\n\nSince the cars move horizontally, and I move vertically, I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find the times when x=0 is occupied by a car on that freeway.\n\nThen, for my path, I need that for each turn, if I'm on y=k (for k=1 to 8), then at that turn, no car on freeway k has x=0 occupied.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position (0, y_t), and if y_t is between 1 and 8, then there must be no car on freeway y_t such that 0 is in its span at turn t.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, I need to check all cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, at y=0 and y=9, no cars, so no problem.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars per freeway at turn t₁=54.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head, tail, dir, speed) = (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nDirection is right, so it's moving right. At turn 54, span is [τ, h]? No.\n\nLet's clarify the notation.\n\nFor right-moving cars, it says: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, ...), but for right-moving, head and tail might be confusing.\n\nLook at freeway 2: (60,49, right,12) and (12,1,right,12)\n\n(60,49) but 60>49, and direction right, so if it's moving right, the head should be the front, I think.\n\nIn the update: for right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h] meaning from τ to h, with τ < h I assume? But in freeway 2, (60,49) with 60>49, and direction right.\n\nPerhaps head and tail are defined such that for right-moving, head is the right end, tail is left end? But in the span, it says [τ, h] for right-moving, which might be [tail, head].\n\nIn freeway 2: (60,49, right,12) — if head=60, tail=49, but 60>49, so tail to head is from 49 to 60? But direction right, so moving right, so at later time, both increase.\n\nSimilarly, (12,1,right,12) from 1 to 12.\n\nBut in the span, for right-moving, it says Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] with ΔT = T-t₁.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nNow for freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so at t₁=54, span is [τ, h] = [-47, 0]? Head is 0, tail is -47, so if tail is left, head is right, then [τ, h] = [-47, 0], and it's moving right, so at time T, span [ -47 + 48(ΔT), 0 + 48(ΔT) ] where ΔT = T - 54.\n\nCollision on freeway 1 if 0 is in the span at turn T, i.e., if -47 + 48(ΔT) <= 0 <= 0 + 48(ΔT) but since it's inclusive, I think.\n\nThe span includes both ends, so [a,b] means a <= x <= b.\n\nFor freeway 1 at turn T, span is [ -47 + 48(ΔT), 48(ΔT) ] since h + sΔT = 0 + 48(ΔT) = 48ΔT\n\nτ + sΔT = -47 + 48ΔT\n\nSo span: [ -47 + 48ΔT, 48ΔT ]\n\n0 is in span if -47 + 48ΔT <= 0 <= 48ΔT\n\nSince 48ΔT >=0 for ΔT>=0, so 0 <= 48ΔT is always true for ΔT >=0.\n\nThen -47 + 48ΔT <= 0 implies 48ΔT <= 47, so ΔT <= 47/48\n\nSince ΔT is integer, ΔT <= 0 because 47/48 <1.\n\nΔT = T - 54, so at T=54, ΔT=0, -47 +0 <=0 <=0, so 0 is in span? -47 <=0<=0, 0<=0 is true, and -47<=0 true, so yes, at T=54, 0 is occupied.\n\nBut at T=54, I am at y=0, not on freeway 1, so for me, when I am on freeway, I need to avoid when 0 is occupied.\n\nAt turn T, if I am on freeway k, then collision if 0 in span of some car on k at T.\n\nFor freeway 1, at T=54, 0 is occupied, but I am at y=0, so no issue.\n\nNow, 0 is in span only if -47 +48ΔT <=0 <=48ΔT\n\nAs above, 0<=48ΔT always for ΔT>=0, and -47+48ΔT <=0 iff 48ΔT <=47 iff ΔT <= 47/48 <1, so only at ΔT=0, i.e., T=54.\n\nFor T>54, ΔT>=1, -47+48*1 =1 >0, so 1 <= x <= 48 for ΔT=1, so 0 not in [1,48], similarly later, span moves right, so 0 not occupied for T>54.\n\nSo on freeway 1, only at turn 54 is x=0 occupied, but since I start at y=0, not on it, and I might go to y=1 later, but at that time, no car at x=0, so freeway 1 is always safe except at T=54 which we don't care for y=1.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nLet me list for each freeway the times when x=0 is occupied.\n\nDefine ΔT = T - 54.\n\nFor each car, find when 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: only one car, as above, occupied only at T=54. So for all T>54, freeway 1 is safe, no car at x=0.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49, right,12) — head=60, tail=49, direction right.\n\nSince direction right, at t₁, span [τ, h] = [49,60]? Head and tail: in notation, (head, tail), but for right-moving, span is [τ, h], so τ=tail=49, h=head=60.\n\nSo at T, span [49 + 12ΔT, 60 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 49 +12ΔT <= 0 <= 60 +12ΔT\n\nBut 49+12ΔT >=49 >0 for ΔT>=0, so 0 <= 60+12ΔT always true, but 49+12ΔT <=0? 49+12ΔT >=49>0, so never <=0. Thus 0 not in span for any T. So this car never at x=0.\n\nSecond car on freeway 2: (12,1,right,12) — head=12, tail=1, so span at T: [1 +12ΔT, 12 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 1+12ΔT <=0 <=12+12ΔT\n\n1+12ΔT >=1>0 for ΔT>=0, so never <=0, thus 0 not in span. So freeway 2 always safe, no car at x=0.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? Cars: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12) — identical to freeway 2.\n\nSo same, no car at x=0 ever. Safe.\n\nFreeway 4: (12,47, left,36) — direction left.\n\nFor left-moving, span at T: [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] = [12 - 36ΔT, 47 - 36ΔT]? Head=12, tail=47? But 12<47, and direction left.\n\nIn left-moving, span update: [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nAnd at t₁, span is [h, τ], I think.\n\nFrom the text: \"left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t₁), τ - s (T-t₁)]\"\n\nYes.\n\nSo for this car, h=12, τ=47, direction left, speed 36.\n\nAt t₁, span [12,47]\n\nAt T, [12 - 36ΔT, 47 - 36ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 12 - 36ΔT <= 0 <= 47 - 36ΔT\n\nNow, 0 <= 47 - 36ΔT implies 36ΔT <=47, so ΔT <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so ΔT <=1 since integer.\n\nAnd 12 - 36ΔT <=0 implies 12 <=36ΔT, so ΔT >= 12/36 = 1/3, so ΔT >=1 since integer? ΔT integer, so for ΔT=1: 12-36= -24 <=0 <=47-36=11? 0<=11 true, -24<=0 true, so yes.\n\nFor ΔT=0: 12 <=0 <=47? 12<=0 false, so not.\n\nΔT=2: 0 <=47-72= -25? false.\n\nSo only at ΔT=1, T=54+1=55, span [12-36,47-36]=[-24,11], and 0 in [-24,11], yes.\n\nOther times not.\n\nFreeway 4 has only one car? Yes, from table.\n\nSo occupied only at T=55.\n\nNow freeway 5: same as freeway 4?

Turns from t=54 to t=62? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y after action, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position (0, y_t)\n\nI take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nAnd collision at turn t if y_t between 1-8 and 0 occupied on freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, I need y_{t+H} =9 for some H, with actions from t=54 to t=54+H-1, so H actions over H turns, starting from t=54 to t=54+H-1, and position at t=54+H is y=9.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nSet t=54 as start.\n\nAt turn t=54, position y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{54}, I go to y_{55} = y_{54} + Δy_{54}\n\nThen at turn t=55, position y_{55}, and so on.\n\nI need to have y_T =9 for some T.\n\nMinimal H such that after H actions, I am at y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, I have moved H steps, from t=54 to t=54+H.\n\nAt time t=54, before action, y=0.\n\nAfter first action at t=54, I move to y_{55} at time t=55.\n\nGenerally: at time t, y_t is position.\n\nAction a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t=54+H, y_{54+H} =9.\n\nAnd actions from t=54 to t=54+H-1.\n\nThe number of turns from start to reach is H, since we start at t=54, reach at t=54+H.\n\nBut the sequence has H actions: a_{54} to a_{54+H-1}.\n\nNow, collision: at each time t, for t from 54 to 54+H-1, when I am at y_t, if 1<=y_t<=8, must not have car at x=0 on freeway y_t at time t.\n\nAt time t=54+H, I am at y=9, no issue.\n\nNow, from above, dangerous times:\n\nFreeway 4: occupied at t=55\n\nFreeway 5: occupied at t=55\n\nFreeway 7: occupied at t=55 (and t=54, but t=54 y=0)\n\nFreeway 6: occupied at t=61,62\n\nFreeway 8: occupied at t=69,70,71,72\n\nFreeway 1,2,3 always safe.\n\nNow, at t=55, freeway 4,5,7 are occupied.\n\nSo if I am on y=4,5, or 7 at t=55, collision.\n\nNow, at t=55, where can I be?\n\nStart at t=54, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{54}, y_{55} can be:\n\n- If a_{54}=U, y_{55}=1\n\n- If a_{54}=S, y_{55}=0\n\n- If a_{54}=D, y_{55}= -1, but y must be in [0,9], so y_{55} >=0, so D not possible from y=0? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so from y=0, if a_t=D, y_{t+1} = -1, which is invalid, I assume it's not allowed, or clipped? But the problem says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so probably actions are restricted to keep y in bounds.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, cannot go up.\n\nSo from y=0, possible actions: U or S, cannot D.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, can D or S, cannot U.\n\nNow at t=54, y=0, so a_{54} can be U or S.\n\nIf a_{54}=U, y_{55}=1\n\nIf a_{54}=S, y_{55}=0\n\nNow at t=55, if y_{55}=1, freeway 1 is safe, as we saw, only dangerous at t=54, but t=55 safe.\n\nIf y_{55}=0, also safe.\n\nBut at t=55, freeway 4,5,7 occupied, but since y=1 or 0, not on those, so no collision.\n\nThe issue is if I go to higher y at t=55.\n\nBut at t=55, I can only be at y=0 or y=1, since from y=0 at t=54.\n\nSo at t=55, y=0 or 1, both safe, since freeway 1 safe at t=55, and y=0 no freeway.\n\nNo problem at t=55.\n\nThen I need to go up.\n\nBut later there are dangers.\n\nSpecifically, freeway 6 occupied at t=61 and 62.\n\nSo if I am on y=6 at t=61 or t=62, collision.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 occupied at t=69 to 72.\n\nSince I want minimal H, probably H=9, going directly up in 9 moves.\n\nStart at t=54, y=0.\n\nAfter 9 moves up, I reach y=9 at t=63.\n\nt=54: y=0\n\na_{54}=U, t=55: y=1\n\na_{55}=U, t=56: y=2\n\na_{56}=U, t=57: y=3\n\na_{57}=U, t=58: y=4\n\na_{58}=U, t=59: y=5\n\na_{59}=U, t=60: y=6\n\na_{60}=U, t=61: y=7\n\na_{61}=U, t=62: y=8\n\na_{62}=U, t=63: y=9\n\nNow, check collisions.\n\nAt each turn, when y_t between 1-8, check if freeway occupied.\n\nt=55: y=1, freeway 1, which is safe (only occupied at t=54)\n\nt=56: y=2, freeway 2, always safe\n\nt=57: y=3, freeway 3, always safe\n\nt=58: y=4, freeway 4, occupied at t=55? But t=58, not occupied. Freeway 4 occupied only at t=55, so at t=58 safe.\n\nt=59: y=5, freeway 5, occupied only at t=55, so safe.\n\nt=60: y=6, freeway 6, occupied at t=61 and 62, not at t=60? t=60, ΔT=60-54=6, freeway 6 occupied at ΔT=7,8 i.e. t=61,62.\n\nAt t=60, ΔT=6, freeway 6: car span [-53+6*6, -42+6*6] = [-53+36, -42+36] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nt=61: y=7? In the sequence, at t=61, y=7? Let's see:\n\nt=60: y=6\n\na_{60}=U, so t=61: y=7\n\nAt t=61, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 occupied when? At t=54 and 55, but t=61.\n\nFreeway 7 cars: first car never at 0, second car at t=54 and 55.\n\nAt t=61, ΔT=61-54=7, span for second car: [-7 +4*7, 4+4*7] = [-7+28,4+28]=[21,32], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nBut freeway 6 is occupied at t=61 and 62, but at t=61 I am on y=7, not y=6.\n\nt=61: y=7, freeway 7, which is safe at t=61.\n\nt=62: y=8, from above, a_{61}=U, so t=62: y=8\n\nAt t=62, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 occupied at t=69,70,71,72, not at t=62.\n\nt=62, ΔT=8, freeway 8: span [-56+3*8, -45+3*8]= [-56+24, -45+24]= [-32,-21], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=63: y=9, safe.\n\nIn this sequence, all safe? But at t=61 and t=62, freeway 6 is occupied, but I am not on y=6 at those times; I am on y=7 and y=8.\n\nIn the path: at t=60: y=6, which is safe as above.\n\nt=61: y=7, safe.\n\nt=62: y=8, safe.\n\nNo collision.\n\nBut freeway 6 occupied at t=61 and 62, but I am not on y=6 then.\n\nSimilarly, other dangers later, but I reach at t=63.\n\nFreeway 8 occupied at t=69-72, but I am done by t=63.\n\nSo this sequence seems safe with H=9.\n\nBut let me confirm the turns.\n\nStart t=54: y=0\n\na54=U → t=55: y=1\n\na55=U → t=56: y=2\n\na56=U → t=57: y=3\n\na57=U → t=58: y=4\n\na58=U → t=59: y=5\n\na59=U → t=60: y=6\n\na60=U → t=61: y=7\n\na61=U → t=62: y=8\n\na62=U → t=63: y=9\n\nNow, at t=60: y=6, freeway 6: as above, span [-17,-6] for ΔT=6, not include 0.\n\nt=61: y=7, freeway 7: car1 [41+4*7,52+4*7]=[41+28,52+28]=[69,80], not 0; car2 [-7+4*7,4+4*7]=[-7+28,4+28]=[21,32], not 0. Safe.\n\nt=62: y=8, freeway 8: span [-56+24, -45+24]=[-32,-21], not 0. Safe.\n\nAnd I reach y=9 at t=63.\n\nBut is there any problem? Freeway 6 is occupied at t=61 and 62, but I am not on it.\n\nIn this path, I was on y=6 at t=60, which is safe, and then moved to y=7 at t=61.\n\nAt t=61, freeway 6 is occupied, but I am on y=7, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut the task is to reach (0,9), and I do at t=63.\n\nMinimal H: since from 0 to 9, at least 9 up moves, so H=9 should be minimal.\n\nBut I need to output the actions from t=54 to t=62, for H=9 actions.\n\nt=54 to t=62, that's 9 actions: a54 to a62.\n\nIn the sequence above, all actions are U.\n\nBut let me check if at any point I need to avoid something.\n\nAnother thing: at t=55, freeway 4,5,7 occupied, but I was at y=1, not affected.\n\nIn this path, I go through each freeway quickly.\n\nBut freeway 5 occupied only at t=55, I am at y=5 at t=59, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster? But 9 moves is minimum, since each move changes y by at most 1.\n\nUnless I start from y=0, to y=9, need at least 9 up moves.\n\nIf I stay or down, it takes more turns, so H larger.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nBut in this case, with all U, it seems safe.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway at the times.\n\nFreeway 1: only dangerous at t=54, I am at y=0.\n\nFreeway 2: always safe\n\nFreeway 3: always safe\n\nFreeway 4: occupied t=55, I am at y=4 at t=58, which is safe.\n\nt=58: ΔT=4, freeway 4 car: [12-36*4,47-36*4]=[12-144,47-144]=[-132,-97], not 0.\n\nFreeway 5: similar, at t=59, y=5, ΔT=5, [12-180,47-180]=[-168,-133], not 0.\n\nFreeway 6: at t=60, y=6, ΔT=6, span [-53+36, -42+36]=[-17,-6], not 0. Occupied at t=61,62, not at t=60.\n\nFreeway 7: at t=61, y=7, as above safe.\n\nFreeway 8: at t=62, y=8, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut the problem has freeway 6 occupied at t=61,62, which are turns 61 and 62 from start, but in absolute, t=54+7=61, t=54+8=62.\n\nIn my path, at t=61 I am on y=7, not 6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 occupied later.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut is there a reason I need to avoid? For example, if I were on y=6 at t=61, but I'm not.\n\nPerhaps I can go slower to avoid later, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: at the beginning, I could stay, but that would increase H.\n\nSo all U should work.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nI need to output the actions.\n\nBut the car states, is there any mistake?\n\nFreeway 7: at t=55 occupied, but I was at y=1 or 0, not on 7.\n\nIn my path, I reach y=7 at t=61, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8, but I am at y=8 at t=62, before the danger at t=69.\n\nSo all seems safe.\n\nBut the minimal H is 9.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can reach earlier? No, because from y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 moves.\n\nUnless I start from a different position, but I start at y=0.\n\nSo H=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions are all U.\n\nBut perhaps I need to specify for each turn.\n\nNow, the current turn is t₁=54, so I need actions from t=54 to t=54+H-1.\n\nFor H=9, actions at t=54 to t=62.\n\nAll U.\n\nBut let me write the answer.\n\nBut is there a problem with freeway at y=6 or something?\n\nAnother point: when I move, I am not on the freeway during the move, but the collision is only when on the freeway at the turn.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 6, occupied at t=61 and 62, but if I were to be on y=6 at that time, I need to avoid.\n\nBut in direct path, I am not.\n\nSuppose I go slower, I might hit the freeway 8 danger, but since I reach early, no.\n\nFor example, if I took more turns, I might be on y=8 at t=69, which is dangerous, but I am at t=62, before.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if the path is possible with fewer actions, but impossible.\n\nSo I think the sequence is all U.\n\nBut let me list the actions:\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U  (to y=2 at t=56? Let's list positions.\n\nAt t=54: y=0, action a54=U → t=55: y=1\n\na55=U → t=56: y=2\n\n...\n\nUp to a62=U → t=63: y=9\n\nActions: a54 to a62, all U.\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 54: a_{54} = U\n\nTurn 55: a_{55} = U\n\n...\n\nTurn 62: a_{62} = U\n\nBut the turn labels: from t=54 to t=62, that's 9 turns of actions.\n\nH=9.\n\nBut in the box.\n\nPerhaps I need to write it.\n\nBut let me see if there is any constraint I missed.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y, with U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\nAnd y in [0,9].\n\nAlso, collision only if on freeway and car at x=0 at same turn.\n\nIn this case, all fine.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 7, at t=55 occupied, but I am at y=1.\n\nAnother thing: multiple cars per freeway, but I think I covered.\n\nFreeway 2 and 3 have cars, but never at x=0.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", and in this case H=9.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach in less? No.\n\nUnless I start moving earlier, but no, I start at t=54.\n\nPerhaps by going down, but from y=0, cannot go down, and going down would make it take longer to reach 9.\n\nSo H=9 is minimal.\n\nThus the sequence is all U.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway 6 again.\n\nFreeway 6: car at (-42,-53, right,6)\n\nAt t=54, span [-53,-42]?

The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) at every turn, as this direct path avoids all collisions with cars on the freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance:\n- The dangerous times for each freeway (when a car occupies \\(x = 0\\)) are:\n  - Freeway 1: Occupied only at turn 54 (safe for \\(t > 54\\)).\n  - Freeway 2: Always safe (no car occupies \\(x = 0\\)).\n  - Freeway 3: Always safe (no car occupies \\(x = 0\\)).\n  - Freeway 4: Occupied only at turn 55.\n  - Freeway 5: Occupied only at turn 55.\n  - Freeway 6: Occupied at turns 61 and 62.\n  - Freeway 7: Occupied at turns 54 and 55.\n  - Freeway 8: Occupied at turns 69 to 72.\n\n- Path and collision check (player position at each turn \\(t\\)):\n  - \\(t = 54\\): Position \\((0, 0)\\) (not on any freeway, safe).\n  - \\(t = 55\\): Position \\((0, 1)\\) (freeway 1 safe at \\(t = 55\\)).\n  - \\(t = 56\\): Position \\((0, 2)\\) (freeway 2 always safe).\n  - \\(t = 57\\): Position \\((0, 3)\\) (freeway 3 always safe).\n  - \\(t = 58\\): Position \\((0, 4)\\) (freeway 4 safe, as occupied only at \\(t = 55\\)).\n  - \\(t = 59\\): Position \\((0, 5)\\) (freeway 5 safe, as occupied only at \\(t = 55\\)).\n  - \\(t = 60\\): Position \\((0, 6)\\) (freeway 6 safe at \\(t = 60\\), as occupied at \\(t = 61\\) and \\(62\\) only).\n  - \\(t = 61\\): Position \\((0, 7)\\) (freeway 7 safe at \\(t = 61\\), as occupied only at \\(t = 54\\) and \\(55\\)).\n  - \\(t = 62\\): Position \\((0, 8)\\) (freeway 8 safe at \\(t = 62\\), as occupied from \\(t = 69\\) to \\(72\\)).\n  - \\(t = 63\\): Position \\((0, 9)\\) (reached goal, no freeway).\n\nSince the player is never on a freeway \\(y\\) at a turn when \\(x = 0\\) is occupied for that freeway, no collisions occur. The path reaches \\(y = 9\\) in 9 turns, which is the minimum possible since each move changes \\(y\\) by at most 1.\n\n### Sequence of Actions:\nThe actions for turns \\(t = 54\\) to \\(t = 62\\) are all \"U\" (up).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 54: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 55: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 56: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 57: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 58: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 59: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 60: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 61: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 62: & U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1=55, and I start at y=1.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements because I need to avoid them when I'm on their row at the same turn.\n\nThe player position updates based on actions: U for up (y+1), D for down (y-1), S for stay (y same). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nFor cars, they move left or right. The span is given at turn t1, and for future turns T, the span shifts based on speed.\n\n- Left-moving cars: span moves left, so positions decrease.\n\n- Right-moving cars: span moves right, so positions increase.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway k (y_T = k) and 0 is in the car's span at that turn. 0 is the x-position where the player is, I assume, since player is always at x=0.\n\nPlayer is at (0, y_t), so x=0 always, only y changes.\n\nSo, for a car on freeway i, at turn T, if y_T = i and 0 is within [head(T), tail(T)] for left-moving or [tail(T), head(T)] for right-moving? Let's see the notation.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's left-moving, head and tail both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, at t1, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], which might be from left to right, so τ is left end, h is right end? But in the update, for right-moving, τ + s(T-t1) and h + s(T-t1), so both increase, meaning the car moves right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, both decrease.\n\nNow, for collision: at turn T, if player is on freeway k, and for a car on that freeway, 0 is in Span(T).\n\nSpan(T) for a car: for left-moving, it's [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], where ΔT = T - t1.\n\nFor right-moving, it's [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nAnd 0 is in that interval.\n\nAlso, note that when you move to a new row, you are not on that row until the next turn. Specifically: if at turn T you are on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, you are still on y_T, so you only check cars on y_T at turn T. At turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so you check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nMeaning, at the turn when you move, you are still on the old row for collision purposes.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=1 to y=9. Since y starts at 1, and I need to reach 9, I probably need to move up, but I can move down or stay to avoid cars.\n\nMinimal turns: since I need to go up 8 rows (from 1 to 9), if there were no cars, I could just go up 8 times in 8 turns. But with cars, I might need to delay or something.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars at t1=55 for each freeway.\n\nFreeway k from 1 to 8.\n\nGiven:\n\nk=1: (48,1,right,48)  // head=48, tail=1, direction=right, speed=48\n\nk=2: (-48,-59,right,12), (24,13,right,12)  // two cars\n\nk=3: same as k=2? (-48,-59,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\nk=4: (-24,11,left,36)\n\nk=5: same as k=4? (-24,11,left,36)\n\nk=6: (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nk=7: (56,45,right,4), (8,-3,right,4)  // two cars\n\nk=8: (-42,-53,right,3)\n\nFirst, for each freeway, I need to know when a car is at x=0 for some turn T.\n\nThat is, for each car, find T such that 0 is in Span(T).\n\nSince T is the turn number, and ΔT = T - t1 = T - 55.\n\nLet δ = T - 55, so δ ≥ 0.\n\nFor a car, at time δ after t1, Span(T) can be found.\n\nThen 0 in Span(T) means for left-moving car: min and max of [h - sδ, τ - sδ] contains 0.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nSince it's an interval, I need lower and upper bound.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(T) = [h - sδ, τ - sδ], and since it's moving left, h - sδ is the right end? No.\n\nIn the notation: for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], and h and τ are positions, but which is head and tail?\n\nIt says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\", and for left-moving, it moves left, so at T, head is h - sδ, tail is τ - sδ.\n\nBut which one is left or right? Since it's moving left, the head (front) is at a smaller x when moving left? I need to clarify.\n\nIn the span, for collision, we care about the interval containing x=0.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nAlso, for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end, I think.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor car k on freeway i: head at h, tail at τ.\n\nThen for left-moving: at t1, span is [h, τ], which might be from h to τ, but if moving left, h could be the front.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of the position.\n\nAssume that for left-moving, the car is oriented such that head is towards decreasing x, so at t1, if h is head, it's at position h, tail at τ, and since moving left, at T, head at h - sδ, tail at τ - sδ.\n\nThen the span is from min to max, but since moving left, h - sδ < τ - sδ if h < τ? Not necessarily.\n\nI think I need to interpret the span.\n\nFrom the collision: 0 in Span(T), and Span(T) is the set of x covered by the car.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(T) = [min, max] where min = min(h - sδ, τ - sδ), max = max(h - sδ, τ - sδ), but since it's a car, the span should be contiguous.\n\nIn the update, it's given as [h - sδ, τ - sδ] for left-moving, which is an interval from lower to upper or what?\n\nThe notation [a,b] might not be ordered; it could be that a > b or a < b.\n\nBut in set terms, the span is all x between min and max.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's define the left end and right end of the car.\n\nFor a car, at any time, it occupies an interval [left, right], where left ≤ right.\n\nFor left-moving car: at t1, left = min(h, τ), right = max(h, τ)? No.\n\nThe head and tail: head is the front when moving.\n\nSo for left-moving, head is at the left when moving left, so at t1, if head at h, tail at τ, and moving left, then head is at smaller x, so left end is h, right end is τ, assuming h < τ? Not necessarily.\n\nFor example, on k=1: (48,1,right,48), but this is right-moving? Let's see the direction.\n\nk=1: (48,1,right,48) and direction right, so head at 48, tail at 1, moving right, so at t1, head=48 (right end), tail=1 (left end), so span [1,48] since moving right.\n\nIn the right-moving case, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [1,48] for this car.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like k=4: (-24,11,left,36), head at -24, tail at 11, moving left, so head is at left, tail at right, so span at t1 is [-24,11], I think.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ] = [-24,11], and since moving left, at T, [h - sδ, τ - sδ] = [-24 -36δ, 11 -36δ].\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], at T [τ + sδ, h + sδ].\n\nThen for collision, at turn T, if player on freeway k, and 0 in the span for some car on that freeway.\n\n0 in [a,b] means a ≤ 0 ≤ b, where [a,b] is the interval, so a and b are min and max.\n\nIn the span definition, for left-moving, [h - sδ, τ - sδ], which may have h - sδ > τ - sδ or not, but the interval is from min to max.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nSo to find if 0 in span at T, we need min( h - sδ, τ - sδ ) ≤ 0 ≤ max( h - sδ, τ - sδ ) for left-moving.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: min( τ + sδ, h + sδ ) ≤ 0 ≤ max( τ + sδ, h + sδ ).\n\nBut since for right-moving, τ and h, with τ the tail, h the head, moving right, so usually τ < h, so min is τ, max is h.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, usually h < τ, so min h, max τ.\n\nBut not always, from the data.\n\nLet's list for each car the min and max at t1, and how it moves.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: only one car, right-moving: (48,1,right,48) so at t1, left end τ=1, right end h=48, speed s=48.\n\nSpan at T: [1 + 48δ, 48 + 48δ]\n\n0 in span if 1 + 48δ ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 48δ\n\nBut 1 + 48δ ≥1 >0 for δ≥0, so 0 ≤ 1 +48δ is false, so 0 not in span for any δ. Since left end is 1 +48δ ≥1 >0, always positive, so never at x=0. So on freeway 1, no collision possible. Good, since I start at y=1, but I need to move or stay.\n\nAt turn T, if I am on freeway 1, collision only if 0 in some car span on freeway 1. But here, the car is always to the right, x≥1, so never at x=0. So freeway 1 is safe at all times.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12) direction right, head h=-48, tail τ=-59? Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48] because τ is tail, h is head, moving right, so tail left, head right.\n\nτ=-59, h=-48, so at t1, left end min = -59, right end max = -48.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + sδ, h + sδ] = [-59 +12δ, -48 +12δ]\n\n0 in this if -59 +12δ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +12δ\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst, -59 +12δ ≤ 0 ⇒ 12δ ≤ 59 ⇒ δ ≤ 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so δ ≤ 4 since δ integer? δ = T - 55, turn number, so T integer, δ integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ -48 +12δ ⇒ 48 ≤ 12δ ⇒ δ ≥ 4.\n\nSo for δ=4, -59 +12*4 = -59+48= -11 ≤0, and -48+48=0 ≤0, so 0≤0 true, so at δ=4, 0 in span? -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nAt δ=4, left = -59 +48 = -11, right = -48+48=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nSimilarly, for δ=3: -59+36= -23, -48+36= -12, both negative, -23 ≤0 ≤ -12? 0 ≤ -12 false.\n\nδ=5: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, 1≤0≤12? 0≤1 false? 0 ≤ left end is 1, so 0 not >=1.\n\nSo only at δ=4, 0 is in [ -11, 0], so collision if on freeway 2 at T=55+4=59.\n\nSecond car on freeway 2: (24,13,right,12) head h=24, tail τ=13, moving right.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [13,24]\n\nAt T: [13 +12δ, 24 +12δ]\n\n0 in this? 13 +12δ ≤0? 13+12δ ≥13>0, so never <=0, so always positive, 0 not in span. So only first car matters for freeway 2.\n\nSo freeway 2 has collision only at T=59 when δ=4.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"(-48,-59,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\" identical to k=2.\n\nSo same, collision at T=59 for the first car.\n\nNow freeway 4: (-24,11,left,36) direction left, head at h=-24, tail at τ=11.\n\nFor left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ] = [-24,11]\n\nAt T: [h - sδ, τ - sδ] = [-24 -36δ, 11 -36δ]\n\n0 in this if min(-24-36δ, 11-36δ) ≤ 0 ≤ max(-24-36δ, 11-36δ)\n\nSince s=36>0, δ≥0, -24-36δ decreases, 11-36δ decreases.\n\nAt δ=0, min=-24, max=11, so -24≤0≤11 true, so at t1, 0 is in span.\n\nBut t1 is now, turn 55, and I am at y=1, not on freeway 4 yet.\n\nFor future turns.\n\n0 in span if min(-24-36δ, 11-36δ) ≤0 and max(-24-36δ, 11-36δ) ≥0.\n\nSince both decrease, -24-36δ < 11-36δ always.\n\nSo min is -24-36δ, max is 11-36δ.\n\nThen -24-36δ ≤ 0 always for δ≥0? -24-36δ ≤ -24 <0, true.\n\nAnd 11-36δ ≥0 ⇒ 36δ ≤11 ⇒ δ ≤ 11/36 ≈0.305, so δ=0 only.\n\nδ=0: T=55, at t1, 0 in [-24,11], yes.\n\nBut for δ≥1, 11-36δ ≤11-36=-25<0, and min is even smaller, so max is negative, 0 not <= negative, so 0 not in span.\n\nSo only at δ=0, T=55, freeway 4 has a car at x=0, but since I am not on it at t1 (I am on y=1), and for future, no collision on freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as k=4, (-24,11,left,36), so only at T=55, collision, but not for future.\n\nNow freeway 6: (-36,-47,right,6) direction right, head h=-36, tail τ=-47.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt T: [ -47 +6δ, -36 +6δ ]\n\n0 in this if -47 +6δ ≤ 0 ≤ -36 +6δ\n\nFirst inequality: -47 +6δ ≤0 ⇒ 6δ ≤47 ⇒ δ ≤ 47/6 ≈7.833, δ≤7\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -36 +6δ ⇒ 36 ≤6δ ⇒ δ ≥6\n\nSo for δ=6,7\n\nδ=6: -47+36= -11 ≤0, -36+36=0 ≤0, true\n\nδ=7: -47+42= -5 ≤0, -36+42=6 ≥0, true\n\nδ=8: -47+48=1 ≤0? 1≤0 false, so no.\n\nSo at T=55+6=61 and T=62, collision on freeway 6 if present.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (56,45,right,4) head h=56, tail τ=45, moving right.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [45,56]\n\nAt T: [45 +4δ, 56 +4δ]\n\n0 in this? 45+4δ ≥45>0, never <=0, so no.\n\nSecond car: (8,-3,right,4) head h=8, tail τ=-3, moving right.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-3,8]\n\nAt T: [ -3 +4δ, 8 +4δ ]\n\n0 in this if -3 +4δ ≤ 0 ≤ 8 +4δ\n\nFirst: -3+4δ ≤0 ⇒ 4δ ≤3 ⇒ δ ≤ 0.75, so δ=0 only since δ integer? δ=0: -3≤0≤8 true.\n\nδ=1: -3+4=1≤0? false, so only at T=55, δ=0.\n\nBut at T=55, I am on y=1, not y=7, so for future, no collision from this car on freeway 7.\n\nSimilarly, the first car never at x=0.\n\nSo freeway 7 is always safe, no collision possible.\n\nNow freeway 8: (-42,-53,right,3) direction right, head h=-42, tail τ=-53.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-53, -42]\n\nAt T: [ -53 +3δ, -42 +3δ ]\n\n0 in this if -53 +3δ ≤ 0 ≤ -42 +3δ\n\nFirst: -53 +3δ ≤0 ⇒ 3δ ≤53 ⇒ δ ≤ 53/3 ≈17.666, δ≤17\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -42 +3δ ⇒ 42 ≤3δ ⇒ δ ≥14\n\nSo for δ=14 to 17 inclusive.\n\nT=55+14=69 to 72.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when collision occurs if player is on that row at that turn.\n\nFreeway 1: never collision\n\nFreeway 2: collision at T=59 (δ=4)\n\nFreeway 3: collision at T=59 (δ=4)\n\nFreeway 4: collision only at T=55, not future\n\nFreeway 5: same, only T=55\n\nFreeway 6: collision at T=61 and T=62 (δ=6 and 7)\n\nFreeway 7: never collision\n\nFreeway 8: collision at T=69,70,71,72 (δ=14 to 17)\n\nI start at y=1 at t1=55.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is safe, no cars above.\n\ny=9 is the target, no freeway, so no issue.\n\nNow, the minimal number of turns: I need to go from y=1 to y=9, which is 8 steps up, but I might need to stay or move down to avoid collisions.\n\nSince moving up is required, and staying or down might delay, but I need min turns, so I should go up as much as possible, only delay when necessary to avoid collision.\n\nNow, at each turn, I choose action U, D, or S.\n\ny must stay within 0 to 9, so at y=0, I cannot go down, similarly at y=9, cannot go up, but since I start at y=1, and go to y=9, y=0 is possible if I go down, but I might not want to.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nI need to be on each row at some turn, but I can skip rows if I move fast, but since I move one row per turn max, I must be on each intermediate row at some point, except I can be on a row multiple times if I move down and up.\n\nBut to minimize turns, I should avoid unnecessary moves, so probably go directly up, with some stays.\n\nThe critical points are the collision times on each row.\n\nFor row 2: collision at T=59 only\n\nRow 3: collision at T=59 only\n\nRow 6: collision at T=61 and 62\n\nRow 8: collision at T=69-72, but since I want to reach fast, T=69 is late, I might not be there at that time.\n\nFirst, from y=1 to y=9, min 8 turns if no delay.\n\nBut with collisions, I need to avoid being on row 2 at T=59, row 3 at T=59, row 6 at T=61 or 62, row 8 at T=69-72.\n\nOther rows are safe at all times: row1,4,5,7.\n\nRow 4 and 5 have no future collision, row 7 safe, row1 safe.\n\nNow, since I start at y=1 at T=55, I can move immediately.\n\nIf I go up directly, I would be at y=2 at T=56, y=3 at T=57, y=4 at T=58, y=5 at T=59, y=6 at T=60, y=7 at T=61, y=8 at T=62, y=9 at T=63.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt T=56, y=2: row2 has collision only at T=59, so at T=56, safe.\n\nT=57, y=3: row3 collision only at T=59, safe.\n\nT=58, y=4: row4 safe always, no issue.\n\nT=59, y=5: row5 safe always, no issue.\n\nT=60, y=6: row6 has collision at T=61 and 62, not at T=60, so safe? T=60, δ=5 for row6.\n\nEarlier for row6, collision at δ=6 and 7, T=61 and 62.\n\nAt T=60, δ= T-55=5, for row6 car: span [ -47 +6*5, -36 +6*5] = [-47+30, -36+30] = [-17, -6], both negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nT=61, y=6: row6, δ=6, [ -47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0], 0 in, collision! So if I am at y=6 at T=61, collision.\n\nIn the direct path, at T=61 I am at y=6, which is bad.\n\nSimilarly, T=62, y=7? In direct path: T=60 y=6, T=61 y=7? Let's list:\n\nStart T=55, y=1\n\nAfter action: at turn T, after action, y_{t} is position at turn t.\n\nTurn t: position y_t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nThen I perform action a_T, which sets y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, when position is y_T, we check cars on row y_T at that turn.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 55: position y=1, action a_55, which sets y_56.\n\nBut for collision at turn 55: I am on row 1, which is safe.\n\nThen at turn 56: position y_56, which depends on a_55.\n\nIf I go up at T=55, y_56=2.\n\nThen at turn 56, I am on row 2, check cars on row 2 at T=56.\n\nT=56, δ=1 for row2.\n\nRow2 collision only at T=59, so at T=56, safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up again, y_57=3, at turn 57 on row3, safe since only collision at T=59.\n\nThen y_58=4, row4 safe.\n\ny_59=5, row5 safe.\n\ny_60=6, at turn 60 on row6, which as above, safe since δ=5, no collision.\n\nThen if I go up, y_61=7, at turn 61 on row7, which is safe.\n\nBut row6 at turn 61: if I were on row6 at T=61, collision, but in this case at T=61 I am on row7.\n\nIn the path: at T=60 I am on row6, then I go up to row7, so at turn T=61, position is y=7, so I am not on row6 at T=61.\n\nCollision only if on the row at that turn.\n\nAt turn T=61, I am on row7, so check row7 cars, which are safe.\n\nThen at turn 61, action a_61, if U, y_62=8.\n\nAt turn 62, position y=8, row8.\n\nNow row8 collision at T=69-72, not at T=62, so safe? T=62, δ=7 for row8.\n\nRow8 car: at T, [ -53 +3δ, -42 +3δ ]\n\nAt δ=7, T=62, [ -53+21, -42+21] = [-32, -21], both negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at turn 62, if U, y_63=9, at turn 63 on row9, which is target, done.\n\nBut earlier I thought at T=61 on row7, but in this path, from T=60 y=6, go up to y_61=7 at turn 61.\n\nThen to y=8 at turn 62, y=9 at turn 63.\n\nBut row6 at T=61: who is on row6 at T=61? Not me, I am on row7.\n\nSimilarly, row6 collision at T=61 and 62.\n\nAt T=61, if someone on row6, collision, but I am not.\n\nIn this path, I am on row6 only at T=60, which is safe, and row6 at T=61 and 62 are occupied by cars but I am not there.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nBut at T=61, when I am on row7, safe.\n\nT=62 on row8, safe as above.\n\nThen to y=9 at T=63.\n\nBut I start at T=55 y=1, after 8 actions: from T=55 to T=62, actions a55 to a62, positions from y56 to y63.\n\nTurn sequence:\n\n- Turn 55: pos y55=1, action a55 (say U), then y56=2\n\n- Turn 56: pos y56=2, action a56 (U), y57=3\n\n- Turn 57: pos y57=3, action a57 (U), y58=4\n\n- Turn 58: pos y58=4, action a58 (U), y59=5\n\n- Turn 59: pos y59=5, action a59 (U), y60=6\n\n- Turn 60: pos y60=6, action a60 (U), y61=7\n\n- Turn 61: pos y61=7, action a61 (U), y62=8\n\n- Turn 62: pos y62=8, action a62 (U), y63=9\n\nThen at turn 63, pos y63=9, reached.\n\nNow, collision check:\n\nAt each turn, when I am on a row:\n\nT=55: y=1, row1 safe\n\nT=56: y=2, row2: collision only at T=59, so at T=56 safe\n\nT=57: y=3, row3: collision only at T=59, safe\n\nT=58: y=4, row4 safe always\n\nT=59: y=5, row5 safe always\n\nT=60: y=6, row6: δ=5, T-55=5, span [-47+30, -36+30]=[-17,-6], 0 not in, safe\n\nT=61: y=7, row7 safe always\n\nT=62: y=8, row8: δ=7, T-55=7, span [-53+21, -42+21]=[-32,-21], 0 not in, safe\n\nT=63: y=9, no cars, done.\n\nSo in this case, with 8 turns, I reach at T=63, no collision.\n\nBut earlier I thought about row6 at T=61, but I am not there.\n\nSimilarly, row8 collision at later times.\n\nSo is this possible? But in the car on row6, at T=61, it is there, but I am on row7, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut let me confirm the row8 at T=62: δ=7, T=55+7=62, row8 car: τ=-53, h=-42, s=3, so [ -53 +3*7, -42 +3*7] = [-53+21, -42+21] = [-32,-21], yes, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nNow, what about row2 and row3 at T=59? In this path, at T=59 I am on y=5, row5, safe.\n\nAt T=59, row2 has collision, but I am not on row2.\n\nSo seems no problem.\n\nBut is there a reason I need to avoid? For example, if I were slower, but here I am moving up every turn.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster? From y=1 to y=9, min 8 actions to increase by 8.\n\nAfter H actions, I reach y=9 at turn t1 + H.\n\nt1=55, after H turns, position at turn t1 + H.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action at turn t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nTo be at (0,9) at some turn, say at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nThe last action is at turn T-1, which sets y_T.\n\nSince I start at turn t1=55, y55=1.\n\nI need to reach y_T=9 for some T >=55.\n\nThe number of turns from start: from turn 55 to turn T, there are (T - 55) actions: from a55 to a_{T-1}, which determine y56 to y_T.\n\ny_T is set by action at T-1.\n\nTo have y_T=9, and min T - 55? T - 55 is the number of actions to reach turn T.\n\nSince I start at turn 55, and I reach at turn T, the number of actions is (T - 55), because actions from t=55 to t=T-1 inclusive.\n\nFor example, if I reach at turn 56, that means after one action at turn 55, y56=9, so I must go up 8 times in one action? Impossible, since each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nMin actions: to increase y from 1 to 9, need at least 8 up actions, so min actions is 8, reaching at turn 55 + 8 = 63, with y63=9.\n\nSimilarly, in the above, with 8 actions, I reach at turn 63.\n\nAnd as above, no collision.\n\nBut is there a collision I missed?\n\nFor example, at turn 60, y=6, row6, safe.\n\nBut row6 collision at T=61 and 62, but at T=61, I am on y=7.\n\nUnless I stay or something.\n\nIn this path, I don't stay, I move up every turn.\n\nPerhaps on row8, but at T=62 I am on row8, but collision starts at T=69, which is later.\n\nT=69 is 14 turns after, I am at T=62, which is only 7 turns after, so δ=7, not 14.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 2 and 3.\n\nFor example, at T=59, row2 has collision.\n\nIn the path, at T=59, I am on y=5, row5.\n\nSimilarly for row3.\n\nNow, row6 at T=61: collision, but I am on row7 at T=61.\n\nT=61 position y=7.\n\nAction at turn 60 sets y61=7.\n\nAt turn 61, I am on row7.\n\nRow6 at T=61 has car, but I not there.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut the player is at x=0, and car spans include x=0 at those times, but since I am not on that row, no collision.\n\nSo with 8 actions: all U, from T=55 to T=62, actions U each, reaching y=9 at T=63.\n\nBut the sequence of actions: actions from t=55 to t=62 for t from 0 to H-1, H=8.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions for turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nIn the problem: \"sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd H minimal number of turns.\n\nHere H=8, actions from t=55 to t=62? t from 0 to 7.\n\na_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t1} = a55\n\nt=1, a56\n\n...\n\nt=7, a_{62}\n\nAnd position after last action at turn t1 + H -1, which is a_{62}, sets y_{63}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd all actions U.\n\nBut is there a problem with row8 or something? No.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if I can reach faster, but I don't think so.\n\nMin H is 8.\n\nBut let me see if I can avoid the row6 collision time by being slower or faster.\n\nBut in this case, I don't need to, since I am not on row6 at critical times.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut on row6, collision at T=61 and 62.\n\nIn my path, I am on row6 only at T=60, which is fine.\n\nIf I were slower, I might be on row6 at T=61, which is bad, but I am not.\n\nSimilarly, if I go faster, I cannot, since I start at y=1.\n\nUnless I start by staying or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=1 for one turn, then I reach later.\n\nBut min is 8.\n\nPerhaps on other rows.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 4 and 5 had collision at T=55, but I am not on them.\n\nIn future, no issue.\n\nSo I think with all U, I can reach in 8 turns without collision.\n\nBut let me confirm the row8 at T=62.\n\nT=62, y=8, row8.\n\nCar: at δ=7, [ -53 + 3*7, -42 + 3*7] = [-53+21, -42+21] = [-32, -21], min -32, max -21, both <0, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nAnd at T=63, I reach y=9.\n\nBut the target is to reach (0,9), which is not a freeway, so no car issue.\n\nSo H=8, actions all U.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence.\n\nBut is there any reason this might not work?\n\nPerhaps I misunderstood the collision timing.\n\nAnother point: the note about moving to new row.\n\nIn this case, when I move from row to row, at the turn I move, I am on the old row.\n\nFor example, at turn T, I am on row y_T.\n\nI perform action, say U, then y_{T+1} = y_T +1.\n\nAt turn T, I am on y_T, so collision check on row y_T at turn T.\n\nAt turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, check row y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nIn my sequence, all fine.\n\nPerhaps for row6, if I were to stay or something.\n\nBut here no need.\n\nSo I think it's possible in 8 turns.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 7 or others.\n\nFreeway 7 has no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should list the position at each turn.\n\nTurn 55: y=1, row1 safe\n\nAction U: y56=2\n\nTurn 56: y=2, row2 safe (δ=1, T=56, row2 car: first car [-59+12*1, -48+12*1]=[-47,-36], both neg, 0 not in; second car [13+12,24+12]=[25,36], both pos, no. So safe)\n\nAction U: y57=3\n\nTurn 57: y=3, row3 similar, safe\n\nAction U: y58=4\n\nTurn 58: y=4, row4 safe always\n\nAction U: y59=5\n\nTurn 59: y=5, row5 safe always\n\nAction U: y60=6\n\nTurn 60: y=6, row6: δ=5, T=60, car [ -47 +6*5, -36 +6*5] = [-47+30, -36+30] = [-17,-6], both neg, 0 not in, safe\n\nAction U: y61=7\n\nTurn 61: y=7, row7: no car at x=0 ever, safe\n\nAction U: y62=8\n\nTurn 62: y=8, row8: δ=7, T=62, car [ -53 +3*7, -42 +3*7] = [-53+21, -42+21] = [-32,-21], both neg, 0 not in, safe\n\nAction U: y63=9\n\nTurn 63: y=9, reached.\n\nAll safe.\n\nSo minimal H=8, actions all U.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut perhaps I should write it.\n\nBut is there a way with H=7? That would require increasing y by 8 in 7 actions, which means at least one action not up, so y increases less, cannot reach y=9 from y=1 in 7 actions, since max y after 7 actions is y=1+7=8 if all U, or less. Start at y=1, after k actions, y <= 1+k, to be at least 9, need k>=8, so H min=8.\n\nThus H=8 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is all U for turns 55 to 62.\n\nNow in the answer.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 1: (48,1,right,48), at T=55, δ=0, [1,48], not 0; at T=56, [1+48,48+48]=[49,96], not 0, etc. Always x>=1, so never at 0. Good.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 2 and 3, there are two cars, but only one can cause issue, but in this case not at the times I am there.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the minimal number is 8, with all up actions.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nSo for turn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 62: U\n\nBut turn t1 + t for t=0 to 7, so turns 55 to 62.\n\nIn the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I should write it.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH=8.\n\nSequence: a55=U, a56=U, a57=U, a58=U, a59=U, a60=U, a61=U, a62=U.\n\nIn the format.\n\nBut let me see if I can avoid row8 later, but no need.\n\nPerhaps for row8, if I reach earlier, but I reach at T=62, which is fine.\n\nIf I go faster, I can't.\n\nSo I think this is it.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 55\\) is 8. The sequence of actions consists entirely of \"U\" (up) moves, as there are no collisions on the path when moving directly upward at each turn.\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance:\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Safe at all times, as the car (head=48, tail=1, direction=right, speed=48) never occupies x=0 for any \\(\\delta = T - 55 \\geq 0\\).\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Collision only at \\(T=59\\) (\\(\\delta=4\\)).

The key point is that when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I only care about the freeway I'm currently on for collision.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if I'm on freeway y_T and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn T.\n\nThe car spans are given for turn t1=56, and I can compute their positions at future turns using the speed and direction.\n\nFirst, list all cars and their states at t=56:\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head 96, tail 49, direction right, speed 48. Since it's right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [49, 96]? No, the notation says for right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h], so head is larger, tail is smaller.\n\nIn the update: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume, so at t1, it's from τ to h.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] with h > τ, I think.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, decreasing x.\n\nRight-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd collision if 0 in span(T) when I'm on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, freeway 1: cars: (96, 49, right, 48)\n\nSince right, span at t1: [τ, h] = [49, 96]\n\nSpeed 48, so at time T, span: [49 + 48*(T-56), 96 + 48*(T-56)]\n\nI need 0 not in this interval for turn T if I'm on freeway 1 at T.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars: (-36, -47, right, 12) and (36, 25, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: right, τ=-47, h=-36? span [τ,h] = [-47, -36]\n\nSecond car: right, τ=25, h=36? [25,36]\n\nBoth speed 12.\n\nAt T, first car: [-47 + 12*(T-56), -36 + 12*(T-56)]\n\nSecond car: [25 + 12*(T-56), 36 + 12*(T-56)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12) — identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nLeft-moving, so span(t1) = [h, τ] = [-60, -25]? h is head, τ tail, since moving left, head is left, so h < τ? I need to be careful.\n\nIn left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], and since moving left, h is decreasing.\n\nIn the update: left-moving, span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSo at t1, if h and τ are given, with h > τ or what?\n\nIn the example, freeway 4: (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nSo head h=-60, tail τ=-25? But if it's left-moving, and head is at -60, tail at -25, that would mean the car is from x=-60 to x=-25, but moving left, so head is left, tail right? I think I have confusion in terminology.\n\nLet's read the car update carefully.\n\nFor left-moving car: \"head is at h, tail is at τ\" and \"span(t1) = [h, τ]\"\n\nThen span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince moving left, both decrease.\n\nNow, for collision, we care about the interval containing 0.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h], then [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn freeway 4: (-60,-25,left,36), so h=-60, τ=-25, so span at t1: [h, τ] = [-60, -25]\n\nSince left-moving, h should be the left end, τ the right end, so if h=-60, τ=-25, that means the car extends from x=-60 to x=-25, so left end -60, right end -25.\n\nMoving left, so at later time, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span [τ,h] with τ left, h right.\n\nIn freeway 1: (96,49,right,48), so τ=49, h=96, so left end 49, right end 96.\n\nMoving right.\n\nBack to freeway 4: (-60,-25,left,36), span at t1: [-60, -25]\n\nAt T, [-60 -36*(T-56), -25 -36*(T-56)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as freeway 4? (-60,-25,left,36) — identical.\n\nFreeway 6: (-30,-41,right,6) — right, so τ=-41, h=-30? span [τ,h] = [-41,-30]\n\nAt T, [-41 +6*(T-56), -30 +6*(T-56)]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (60,49,right,4) and (12,1,right,4)\n\nFirst car: right, so τ=49, h=60? span [49,60]? But it says (60,49,right,4), so head 60, tail 49, since right, span [τ,h] = [49,60]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,4), span [1,12]\n\nSpeed 4 for both.\n\nAt T, first car: [49 +4*(T-56), 60 +4*(T-56)]\n\nSecond car: [1 +4*(T-56), 12 +4*(T-56)]\n\nFreeway 8: (-39,-50,right,3) — right, so τ=-50, h=-39? span [τ,h] = [-50,-39]\n\nAt T, [-50 +3*(T-56), -39 +3*(T-56)]\n\nNow, player starts at y=2 at t=56.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to move up 7 times, but I can also move down or stay, so the minimal H might be more than 7 if there are obstacles.\n\nSince I start at y=2 and need to be at y=9, and I can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, the minimal number of turns to go up 7 is 7, if I can go straight up without issues.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at 0.\n\nSo I need to check for each freeway from y=2 to y=8, since y=0 and y=9 have no cars, I think? The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, y=9 is the top, both safe.\n\nPlayer at (0,y), and freeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nAt turn T, if player is at y_T, and y_T between 1 and 8, then we check if 0 is in any car span on that freeway at turn T.\n\nIf y_T =0 or 9, no issue.\n\nNow, I start at t=56, y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince I can only move one step per turn, the quickest is to go up every turn, but I might hit a car on some freeway.\n\nSo let's see the times when it's safe to be on each freeway.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, I need to find when 0 is not in the car span at that turn.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway and turn T, 0 not covered by any car on that freeway.\n\nSo for each freeway, I need the set of T where it is safe to be on that row.\n\nSince the cars move, the unsafe times are when some car covers 0.\n\nLet me define the time from t=56, so let τ = T - 56, so at τ=0, current time.\n\nThen for each freeway, find for which τ it is safe to be on that y.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nOne car: right, span at τ=0: [49,96] with speed 48, so at time τ, span [49 +48τ, 96 +48τ]\n\n0 in span if 49 +48τ ≤ 0 ≤ 96 +48τ\n\nSince 49+48τ ≤ 96+48τ always, so 49+48τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 96+48τ\n\nFirst inequality: 49 +48τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 48τ ≤ -49 ⇒ τ ≤ -49/48 ≈ -1.02, but τ ≥0, so for τ≥0, 49+48τ ≥49>0, so 0 < 49+48τ ≤ something, so 0 is always less than left end, so never in span for τ≥0.\n\n49+48τ for τ=0 is 49>0, and increasing, so left end min is 49>0, so 0 < 49+48τ ≤ 96+48τ, so 0 is always left of the car, not in span. So freeway 1 is always safe for all τ≥0.\n\nIs that right? 0 is never in [49+48τ, 96+48τ] since 49+48τ ≥49>0 for τ≥0. Yes.\n\nSo freeway y=1 is always safe.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2\n\nTwo cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,12) — right, so τ=-47, h=-36? span at τ=0: [τ,h] = [-47,-36]\n\nAt time τ, [-47 +12τ, -36 +12τ]\n\n0 in this span if -47 +12τ ≤ 0 ≤ -36 +12τ\n\nWhich requires -47 +12τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -36 +12τ\n\nFirst: -47 +12τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 12τ ≤ 47 ⇒ τ ≤ 47/12 ≈ 3.916\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -36 +12τ ⇒ 36 ≤ 12τ ⇒ τ ≥ 3\n\nSo for τ in [3, 3.916], approximately [3, 47/12]\n\nSince τ integer, τ=3 or 4? 47/12=3.916, so τ from 3 to 3.916, so τ=3 since τ integer.\n\n-47 +12τ ≤ 0 ≤ -36 +12τ\n\nAt τ=3: -47 +36 = -11 ≤0, and 0 ≤ -36 +36=0, so 0≤0 true, so yes, 0 in span.\n\nAt τ=4: -47+48=1 >0? -47+48=1, which is >0, so left end 1>0, so 0 not ≤ left end? 0 ≤ -36+12τ at τ=4: -36+48=12>0, but left end is -47+48=1>0, so span [1,12], 0 not in [1,12].\n\nAt τ=3: span [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0], so 0 in [-11,0].\n\nAt τ=2: -47+24= -23, -36+24= -12, span [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nAt τ=1: [-47+12, -36+12]=[-35,-24], no.\n\nτ=0: [-47,-36], no.\n\nSo only at τ=3, first car covers 0.\n\nNow second car on freeway 2: (36,25,right,12) — span at τ=0 [25,36], at τ, [25+12τ, 36+12τ]\n\n0 in this? 25+12τ ≤0 ≤36+12τ? But 25+12τ ≥25>0 for τ≥0, so always positive, 0 not in span. So only first car can cover 0, and only at τ=3.\n\nThus for freeway 2, unsafe only at τ=3, i.e., T = 56 + 3 = turn 59.\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2, since cars identical, so also unsafe only at τ=3, turn 59.\n\nNow freeway 4: y=4\n\nCar: (-60,-25,left,36) — left-moving, span at τ=0 [h,τ] = [-60,-25]\n\nAt time τ, [h - sτ, τ - sτ] = [-60 -36τ, -25 -36τ]\n\n0 in span if -60 -36τ ≤ 0 ≤ -25 -36τ\n\nNow, -60 -36τ ≤0 always since both negative, and 0 ≤ -25 -36τ? But -25 -36τ ≤ -25 <0 for τ≥0, so 0 ≤ negative number false, so never true. Thus 0 never in span for freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 same, always safe.\n\nFreeway 6: y=6\n\nCar: (-30,-41,right,6) — right, so τ=-41, h=-30? span [τ,h] = [-41,-30]\n\nAt τ, [-41 +6τ, -30 +6τ]\n\n0 in span if -41 +6τ ≤ 0 ≤ -30 +6τ\n\nFirst: -41 +6τ ≤0 ⇒ 6τ ≤41 ⇒ τ ≤ 41/6 ≈6.833\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -30 +6τ ⇒ 6τ ≥30 ⇒ τ ≥5\n\nSo τ from 5 to 6.833, integer τ=5,6\n\nAt τ=5: -41+30= -11 ≤0, 0≤ -30+30=0, true.\n\nAt τ=6: -41+36= -5 ≤0, 0≤ -30+36=6, true.\n\nAt τ=7: -41+42=1>0, not ≤0.\n\nSo unsafe at τ=5 and 6, turns 61 and 62.\n\nT=56+τ, so τ=5: T=61, τ=6: T=62.\n\nNow freeway 7: y=7\n\nTwo cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,4) — right, span [49,60] at τ=0, at τ [49+4τ, 60+4τ], always positive, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4) — span [1,12] at τ=0, at τ [1+4τ, 12+4τ], always ≥1>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo both cars always right of 0, never cover 0. So freeway 7 always safe.\n\nFreeway 8: y=8\n\nCar: (-39,-50,right,3) — right, so τ=-50, h=-39? span [τ,h] = [-50,-39]\n\nAt τ, [-50 +3τ, -39 +3τ]\n\n0 in span if -50 +3τ ≤ 0 ≤ -39 +3τ\n\nFirst: -50 +3τ ≤0 ⇒ 3τ ≤50 ⇒ τ ≤ 50/3 ≈16.666\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -39 +3τ ⇒ 3τ ≥39 ⇒ τ ≥13\n\nSo τ from 13 to 16.666, integer τ=13,14,15,16\n\nAt τ=13: -50+39= -11 ≤0, 0≤ -39+39=0, true.\n\nτ=14: -50+42= -8 ≤0, 0≤ -39+42=3, true.\n\nτ=15: -50+45= -5 ≤0, 0≤ -39+45=6, true.\n\nτ=16: -50+48= -2 ≤0, 0≤ -39+48=9, true.\n\nτ=17: -50+51=1>0, not ≤0.\n\nSo unsafe at τ=13,14,15,16, turns 69,70,71,72.\n\nNow, summarize safe times for each freeway:\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: safe except at τ=3 (turn 59)\n\ny=3: same as y=2, safe except τ=3 (turn 59)\n\ny=4: always safe\n\ny=5: always safe (same as y=4)\n\ny=6: unsafe at τ=5,6 (turns 61,62)\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: unsafe at τ=13-16 (turns 69-72)\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at τ=0, t=56.\n\nNeed to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe minimal H: since I need to go from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps up, so at least 7 turns if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, let's see the path.\n\nI start at y=2, τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, y=2 is safe, since unsafe only at τ=3.\n\nI can be at y=2 now.\n\nI need to move to higher y.\n\nBut y=3 is unsafe at τ=3, etc.\n\nLet me think about moving up.\n\nSuppose I go up every turn: start y=2 at τ=0.\n\nAction U: to y=3 at τ=1 (turn 57)\n\nAt turn 57, τ=1, y=3.\n\nIs y=3 safe at τ=1? Freeway 3 unsafe only at τ=3, so at τ=1, safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 at τ=2.\n\nAt turn 58, τ=2, y=4. y=4 always safe.\n\nU to y=5 at τ=3.\n\nTurn 59, τ=3, y=5.\n\ny=5 always safe, so no problem.\n\nU to y=6 at τ=4.\n\nTurn 60, τ=4, y=6.\n\ny=6 unsafe at τ=5 and 6, but τ=4 is safe? τ=4, y=6.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe at τ=5 and 6, so at τ=4, safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at τ=5.\n\nTurn 61, τ=5, y=7.\n\nBut y=7 is freeway 7, which is always safe, so no issue.\n\nThen U to y=8 at τ=6.\n\nTurn 62, τ=6, y=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe at τ=13-16, τ=6 is before, so safe? τ=6, turns 62, unsafe for y=8 starts at τ=13, so τ=6 safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at τ=7.\n\nTurn 63, τ=7, y=9, safe.\n\nSo in this sequence, I go from y=2 to y=9 in 7 turns: actions U,U,U,U,U,U,U.\n\nAt each step, when I am on a freeway, it is safe at that turn.\n\nLet's list:\n\nt=56, τ=0, y=2: safe (except at τ=3, but τ=0 ok)\n\nAction U to y=3 at next turn.\n\nt=57, τ=1, y=3: safe, since unsafe at τ=3 only.\n\nAction U to y=4\n\nt=58, τ=2, y=4: safe\n\nAction U to y=5\n\nt=59, τ=3, y=5: safe (y=5 always safe)\n\nAction U to y=6\n\nt=60, τ=4, y=6: safe? y=6 unsafe at τ=5,6, τ=4 ok.\n\nAction U to y=7\n\nt=61, τ=5, y=7: safe (always)\n\nAction U to y=8\n\nt=62, τ=6, y=8: safe? y=8 unsafe from τ=13, τ=6 ok.\n\nAction U to y=9\n\nt=63, τ=7, y=9: safe.\n\nSo I reach y=9 at turn 63, which is H=8 turns? From t=56 to t=63, that's 8 actions? Let's see.\n\nStart at t=56, position (0,2)\n\nAfter first action at t=56, move to new y at t=57.\n\nThe sequence: actions at t=56, t=57, ..., up to when I reach y=9.\n\nAt turn T, after action, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nPlayer update: at turn t, action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at turn t, I am at y_t, perform action, then at next turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t if on freeway y_t and 0 in span for that freeway at turn t.\n\nIn this case, at turn t=56, I am at y=2, and we need to check if it is safe, which it is.\n\nThen I perform action a_{56}, say U, then at t=57, I am at y=3.\n\nAt t=57, I am on y=3, need to check safety.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nt=56: at y=2, safe. Action U → y=57: y=3\n\nt=57: at y=3, τ=1, safe. Action U → y=58: y=4\n\nt=58: at y=4, τ=2, safe. Action U → y=59: y=5\n\nt=59: at y=5, τ=3, safe. Action U → y=60: y=6\n\nt=60: at y=6, τ=4, safe (since unsafe at τ=5,6). Action U → y=61: y=7\n\nt=61: at y=7, τ=5, safe. Action U → y=62: y=8\n\nt=62: at y=8, τ=6, safe (unsafe from τ=13). Action U → y=63: y=9\n\nt=63: at y=9, safe, and I have reached.\n\nNow, I reached at t=63, which is after 7 actions: from t=56 to t=62, 7 actions: U at t=56 to t=62, and at t=63 I am at y=9.\n\nNumber of turns: I start at t=56, after H turns, I am at y_{t1 + H}.\n\nt1=56, after H actions, at turn t1 + H, I am at y_{t1 + H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t1, y=2.\n\nAfter 1 action, at t1+1, y=3 or etc.\n\nAfter H actions, at t1+H, y=9.\n\nMinimal H such that I can achieve y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nIn the sequence: after 7 actions: at t=56+7=63, y=9.\n\nH=7.\n\nBut in the actions, I performed actions at t=56 to t=62, 7 actions, and at t=63, position y=9.\n\nNow, during this, I was never on an unsafe freeway at unsafe time.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt t=56 (τ=0), y=2: safe\n\nt=57 (τ=1), y=3: safe\n\nt=58 (τ=2), y=4: safe\n\nt=59 (τ=3), y=5: safe\n\nt=60 (τ=4), y=6: safe (since unsafe at τ=5,6)\n\nt=61 (τ=5), y=7: safe\n\nt=62 (τ=6), y=8: safe\n\nt=63 (τ=7), y=9: safe\n\nAll good.\n\nBut at t=61, y=7, which is safe, and y=6 at t=60 is safe.\n\nNow, is there a problem with y=6? At t=60, τ=4, y=6 safe.\n\nIf I had been at y=6 at t=61, it would be unsafe, but in this path, I was at y=6 at t=60 (safe), then moved to y=7 at t=61, so at t=61 I am on y=7, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo with 7 actions: all U, I can reach in H=7 turns.\n\nBut the answer should be minimal H, and sequence.\n\nH=7, actions: U,U,U,U,U,U,U at t=56 to t=62.\n\nBut let me confirm the freeway 2 and 3 unsafe at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, t=59, I was at y=5, which is safe, not on y=2 or y=3.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 unsafe at τ=5,6, t=61,62.\n\nAt t=61, I am at y=7, not y=6.\n\nAt t=62, y=8, not y=6.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 7.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which I do at t=63.\n\nNow, but in the action sequence, for t=56 to t=62: all U.\n\nBut let me see if I can do in less than 7? No, because from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps needed, since each action changes by at most 1.\n\nSo H=7 is minimal.\n\nBut in this case, it works with all U.\n\nBut is there any constraint I missed?\n\nThe player position: at t=56, y=2.\n\nAfter actions, y increases to 9.\n\nNow, but I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 7 and 8.\n\nFreeway 7 always safe, freeway 8 unsafe only later.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=62, y=8, τ=6, which is before unsafe times, so safe.\n\nThen to y=9.\n\nNow, but the car on freeway 8 is unsafe from τ=13, which is t=56+13=69, much later.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nBut in the freeway 2 and 3, unsafe at τ=3, t=59, but I was at y=5 then, safe.\n\nPerhaps I can start later, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo H=7 seems achievable.\n\nBut the answer format should be for turns starting from t_1.\n\nt_1=56.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nAnd at turn 63, y=9.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, I think.\n\nThe sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: a_{t1}, t=1: a_{t1+1}, ..., t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1+H, position y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, for H=7, actions at t=56 to t=62 (t=0 to 6), and at t=63=56+7, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in the output, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  (which is U)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} (U)\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nWith H=7.\n\nBut let me make sure that at no point I am on a freeway when car at 0.\n\nSpecifically, for y=6, unsafe at t=61 and t=62.\n\nAt t=60, I am on y=6, but t=60 is τ=4, which is safe for y=6.\n\nAt t=61, I am on y=7, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly, t=62, y=8.\n\nt=63, y=9.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I can reach faster, but cannot.\n\nOr if I need to avoid something else.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, I am not on the new row until next turn, but in this case, it's fine.\n\nFor example, when I move from y=6 to y=7 at t=60, action U, so at t=60 I am on y=6, perform U, then at t=61 I am on y=7.\n\nAt t=60, I am on y=6, which is safe at that turn.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut in the freeway 2, at τ=3, unsafe, but I was not there.\n\nNow, but freeway 3 is same, but I was on y=3 at t=57, τ=1, safe.\n\nAll covered.\n\nSo minimal H is 7 with all U.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case, H=7.\n\nBut let me see if I can do with H=6? That would require moving up faster, but each action only changes by 1, so from y=2 to y=9, minimum 7 actions, so H=7 is minimal.\n\nIf I could move faster, but no, only ±1 or 0.\n\nSo H=7 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 7 turns.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 3 is listed same as freeway 2, but I didn't use y=3 at unsafe time.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nPerhaps I should write the answer.\n\nBut the answer format.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 56: U Turn 57: U Turn 58: U Turn 59: U Turn 60: U Turn 61: U Turn 62: U }\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nIn the box, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nWith H=7, so from turn 56 to turn 62.\n\nt_1 + H-1 = 56 + 6 = 62? H=7, t from 0 to 6, so t_1 to t_1+6.\n\nt_1 + (H-1) = 56 + 6 = 62.\n\nYes.\n\nActions all U.\n\nBut in the sequence, it's a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: a_{56}, t=1: a_{57}, ..., t=6: a_{62}\n\nAll U.\n\nNow, but the player reaches (0,9) at turn 63.\n\nBut the collision is only checked when on freeway, which at y=9, no freeway, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose at some point I had to wait.\n\nFor example, if I were at y=6 at t=61, it would be unsafe, but I avoided it by moving up.\n\nSimilarly, no need to wait.\n\nPerhaps I can go slower, but that would increase H.\n\nSo minimal is 7.\n\nAnother thing: the initial position, at t=56, y=2, is it possible that I need to move immediately or something, but in this case, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can consider moving down, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nSo I think H=7 with all U is correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn 56 and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 7, achieved by moving up (U) every turn from turn 56 to turn 62. This sequence ensures the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 63 without any collisions, as verified below:\n\n- At turn 56, player is at \\(y = 2\\). Freeway 2 is unsafe only at turn 59 (\\(\\tau = 3\\)), so it is safe at turn 56 (\\(\\tau = 0\\)).\n- Action U: player moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 57.\n- At turn 57, player is at \\(y = 3\\). Freeway 3 is unsafe only at turn 59, so it is safe at turn 57 (\\(\\tau = 1\\)).\n- Action U: player moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 58.\n- At turn 58, player is at \\(y = 4\\). Freeway 4 is always safe.\n- Action U: player moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 59.\n- At turn 59, player is at \\(y = 5\\). Freeway 5 is always safe.\n- Action U: player moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 60.\n- At turn 60, player is at \\(y = 6\\). Freeway 6 is unsafe at turns 61 and 62 (\\(\\tau = 5, 6\\)), so it is safe at turn 60 (\\(\\tau = 4\\)).\n- Action U: player moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 61.\n- At turn 61, player is at \\(y = 7\\). Freeway 7 is always safe.\n- Action U: player moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 62.\n- At turn 62, player is at \\(y = 8\\). Freeway 8 is unsafe from turns 69 to 72 (\\(\\tau = 13\\) to \\(16\\)), so it is safe at turn 62 (\\(\\tau = 6\\)).\n- Action U: player moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 63.\n\nSince \\(y = 9\\) has no cars, it is safe. The player reaches (0, 9) at turn 63 after 7 actions, and \\(H = 7\\) is minimal because moving from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 9\\) requires at least 7 upward moves.\n\nThe sequence of actions is all U for turns 56 to 62.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 56: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 57: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 58: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 59: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 60: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 61: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 62: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,3) at turn 57 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically with actions U (up), D (down), or S (stay), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens if at any turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and there's a car on that freeway where 0 is in the car's span at that turn. The span moves left or right based on direction and speed.\n\nImportant note: When you move to a new y at turn T, you're not on that new y until turn T+1. So at turn T, you're on y_T, and you choose an action to go to y_{T+1}. If you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, you won't be on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you don't check for collision on y_{T+1} at turn T, only at T+1 when you're actually there.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, since freeways are y=1 to 8. y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars. So once we reach y=9, we're done, and no collision check needed there.\n\nCurrent position is (0,3) at turn 57. I need to go to y=9, which is 6 units up, so minimum 6 turns if we could go straight up with U each turn, but we have to avoid the cars on y=4 to y=8.\n\ny=3 is the current position, but y=3 is a freeway, so we might be on it at turn 57. But at turn 57, we start at (0,3), so we need to check if there's a collision at turn 57 on y=3.\n\nLet me list the car states for each freeway at turn t1=57.\n\nFreeway k=1: one car: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nSince direction is right, and head is -48, tail is -95? That seems odd. Head and tail: for right-moving, head is the front, so if it's moving right, head should be greater than tail. Here head=-48, tail=-95, and direction right. -48 > -95, so head is at -48, tail at -95, so the car spans from x=-95 to x=-48? But since it's moving right, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]? Let me confirm the update rule.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h], with τ < h I assume, and at T, it's [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] where ΔT = T - t1.\n\nIn this case, for k=1: cars: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nBut span is given as (head, tail, dir, speed). Head and tail: for right-moving, head is the front, tail is the back, so head > tail. Here head=-48, tail=-95, since -48 > -95, so head=-48, tail=-95, so at t1, span is [tail, head] = [-95, -48]? No.\n\nAccording to the notation: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], and τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for right-moving, head is the front, tail is the back.\n\nSo for k=1: head = -48, tail = -95, dir=right, speed=48.\n\nSo at t1, Span(t1) = [tail, head] = [-95, -48] for right-moving.\n\nThen at turn T, Span(T) = [tail + s(T-t1), head + s(T-t1)] = [-95 + 48ΔT, -48 + 48ΔT] where ΔT = T - 57.\n\nCollision if 0 is in Span(T) for the freeway we're on at turn T.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nNow, let's list all cars for each freeway at t1=57.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=-48, tail=-95, dir=right, s=48) → Span(t1) = [-95, -48] (since right-moving)\n\nFreeway 2: two cars: first (-24, -35, right, 12) and second (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nFor first car: head=-24, tail=-35, dir=right, s=12 → Span(t1) = [tail, head] = [-35, -24]\n\nSecond car: head=48, tail=37, dir=right, s=12 → Span(t1) = [37, 48]? Tail=37, head=48, so [37,48]\n\nBut tail should be less than head for right-moving, 37<48, yes.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? It says (-24, -35, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12) — identical to freeway 2.\n\nIs that a typo or intentional? I'll assume it's as given.\n\nFreeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nLeft-moving: for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], with h > τ? Head and tail.\n\nFor left-moving, head is the front, which is left side if moving left, so head should be greater than tail? Let's see.\n\nIn the update: left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nAnd in the state, it's (head, tail, dir, speed)\n\nFor left-moving, if head is the front and moving left, head should be on the left, so head > tail.\n\nHere, head=48, tail=83? 48 < 83, that can't be. Tail=83, head=48, but if moving left, head should be left, so head should be greater than tail? Confusion.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ], and it moves left, so at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nIn the state, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed)\n\nFor left-moving, if Span(t1) = [h, τ], with h and τ, but which is head and tail?\n\nThe notation says \"head h, tail τ\", so head is h, tail is τ.\n\nFor left-moving, since it's moving left, the head (front) should be on the left, so h should be greater than τ, because as it moves left, x decreases.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head on right, h > τ.\n\nIn freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36) — head=48, tail=83, but 48 < 83, so if moving left, head=48, tail=83, but tail=83 > head=48, so the span [h, τ] = [48,83], but since moving left, at t1, it's from x=48 to x=83? But if moving left, it should be decreasing, so the left end should be head.\n\nI think there's inconsistency.\n\nPerhaps for left-moving, the head is the leftmost point, tail is rightmost.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head is rightmost, tail leftmost.\n\nIn freeway 4: head=48, tail=83, dir=left, so since left-moving, head=48 (left), tail=83 (right), so Span(t1) = [h, τ] = [48,83] for left-moving.\n\nThen at T, Span(T) = [48 - 36ΔT, 83 - 36ΔT]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, head is right, tail left.\n\nIn freeway 1: head=-48, tail=-95, dir=right, so tail=-95 (left), head=-48 (right), Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-95, -48]\n\nNow freeway 5: (48, 83, left, 36) — same as freeway 4? Head=48, tail=83, left, s=36.\n\nFreeway 6: (-24, -35, right, 6) — head=-24, tail=-35, dir=right, s=6, so Span(t1) = [-35, -24]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 4) and (16, 5, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: head=-48, tail=-59, dir=right, s=4, Span(t1) = [-59, -48]\n\nSecond car: head=16, tail=5? Tail=5, head=16, dir=right, s=4, so Span(t1) = [5,16]\n\nBut tail=5, head=16, yes.\n\nFreeway 8: (-36, -47, right, 3) — head=-36, tail=-47, dir=right, s=3, Span(t1) = [-47, -36]\n\nNow, the player starts at turn 57 on y=3.\n\nFirst, check if at turn 57, on y=3, is there a collision?\n\nFreeway 3 has cars, but y=3 is freeway, so need to check if 0 in Span for any car on y=3 at T=57.\n\nFreeway 3: cars: first (-24,-35,right,12) → Span(57) = [-35,-24]\n\nSecond (48,37,right,12) → Span(57) = [37,48]\n\nIs 0 in [-35,-24]? -35 to -24, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nIs 0 in [37,48]? 37 to 48, all positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo at turn 57, on y=3, no collision. Good.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9. y=9 is row 9, which is not a freeway, so safe.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe zones.\n\nWe start at y=3, need to reach y=9, so we need to move up through y=4,5,6,7,8 to 9.\n\nBut we can also move down to y=2,1,0 if needed, but since we need to go up, probably not necessary, but might be to avoid cars.\n\nMinimal turns is 6 if we go straight up, but we have to check if we can do that without collision.\n\nEach turn we move or stay.\n\nThe actions are chosen at each turn, and we move to new y at next turn.\n\nAt turn T, we are on y_T, and we choose a_T to determine y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T for y_T.\n\nTo reach y=9 at some turn, say at turn 57+H, we have y_{57+H} =9.\n\nSince we start at turn 57, after H actions, at turn 57+H, we have position after H actions.\n\nLet t be the turn index from t1=57.\n\nAt time t (global turn), y_t is position.\n\nAt t=57, y=3.\n\nWe apply actions a_{57}, a_{58}, ..., up to some a_{57+H-1}, so after H actions, at turn 57+H, y_{57+H} =9.\n\nAnd for each turn from 57 to 57+H-1, we are on some y_t, and need no collision at that turn.\n\nAt turn 57+H, we are on y=9, which is safe, no check needed.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from 57 to 57+H-1, determining y from t=57 to t=57+H.\n\nAt t=57, we are on y=3, no action yet, but we choose action for the next position.\n\nThe action a_t is chosen at turn t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAnd at turn t, we are on y_t, and we check collision for y_t at turn t.\n\nThen we choose a_t to go to y_{t+1}.\n\nWe need to reach y_{t} =9 for some t.\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, at turn 57+H, y=9.\n\nAnd for turns 57 to 57+H-1, we are on y_t between 0 and 8, and need no collision if y_t in 1-8.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid the cars.\n\nFirst, let's find when cars occupy x=0 on each freeway.\n\nCollision if at turn T, for freeway y_T, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway.\n\nSince the player is at x=0 always, I assume, since moving vertically only.\n\nThe position is (0, y_t), so x=0 always.\n\nSo for each freeway row, we need to know when a car has 0 in its span.\n\nFor a given freeway k, at turn T, if there is a car with 0 in [Span(T)].\n\nThen if the player is on row k at turn T, collision.\n\nNow, for each row, let's find the times when x=0 is occupied.\n\nFirst, row y=1: freeway 1, one car: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nSpan at T: since right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-57), h + s(T-57)] = [-95 + 48ΔT, -48 + 48ΔT] where ΔT = T-57.\n\n0 in Span if -95 + 48ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 48ΔT\n\nSo -95 + 48ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 48ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -95 + 48ΔT ≤ 0 => 48ΔT ≤ 95 => ΔT ≤ 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so ΔT ≤ 1 since integer.\n\nΔT = T-57, integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -48 + 48ΔT => 48ΔT ≥ 48 => ΔT ≥ 1\n\nSo ΔT ≥ 1 and ΔT ≤ 1, so ΔT =1.\n\nThus at T=58, 0 in span.\n\nFor other T, not.\n\nAt ΔT=1, Span = [-95 +48(1), -48 +48(1)] = [-47, 0], so 0 is included.\n\nAt ΔT=0, [-95,-48], 0 not in.\n\nAt ΔT=2, [-95+96, -48+96] = [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=58, on row 1, collision possible.\n\nBut row 1 is y=1.\n\nNow, row y=2: freeway 2, two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,12) → Span(T) = [-35 +12ΔT, -24 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -35 +12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -24 +12ΔT\n\nFirst: -35 +12ΔT ≤ 0 => 12ΔT ≤ 35 => ΔT ≤ 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so ΔT ≤ 2\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -24 +12ΔT => 12ΔT ≥ 24 => ΔT ≥ 2\n\nSo ΔT ≥2 and ΔT ≤2, so ΔT=2.\n\nAt T=59, Span = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nOther times not.\n\nSecond car on y=2: (48,37,right,12) → Span(T) = [37 +12ΔT, 48 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in [37+12ΔT, 48+12ΔT]? Since 37+12ΔT >0 for ΔT≥0, min at ΔT=0 is 37>0, so always positive, 0 never in. So only first car matters, collision only at T=59 on y=2.\n\nSimilarly, row y=3: freeway 3, same as y=2? Cars: (-24,-35,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nFirst car: Span(T) = [-35+12ΔT, -24+12ΔT]\n\n0 in when ΔT=2, as above.\n\nSecond car: [37+12ΔT,48+12ΔT], 0 never in.\n\nBut at T=57, ΔT=0, we are on y=3, Span=[-35,-24] and [37,48], 0 not in, as we saw.\n\nCollision at T=59 on y=3? ΔT=2, T=59.\n\ny=3 at T=59, if player is there.\n\nNow row y=4: freeway 4, car (48,83,left,36)\n\nLeft-moving, Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] = [48 - 36ΔT, 83 - 36ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 48 - 36ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 83 - 36ΔT\n\nFirst: 48 - 36ΔT ≤ 0 => 48 ≤ 36ΔT => ΔT ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so ΔT ≥ 2 since integer.\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 83 - 36ΔT => 36ΔT ≤ 83 => ΔT ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so ΔT ≤ 2\n\nThus ΔT ≥2 and ΔT ≤2, so ΔT=2.\n\nAt T=59, Span = [48-72, 83-72]? ΔT=2, [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11], so -24 to 11, 0 is in.\n\nOther times not.\n\nFor example, ΔT=1, [48-36,83-36]=[12,47], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=2, [-24,11], 0 in.\n\nΔT=3, [48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=59 on y=4.\n\nBut freeway 4 has one car, and y=5 same? Freeway 5: (48,83,left,36) same as y=4, so also collision at T=59 on y=5.\n\nNow row y=6: freeway 6, car (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nSpan(T) = [-35 +6ΔT, -24 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in if -35 +6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -24 +6ΔT\n\nFirst: -35 +6ΔT ≤0 => 6ΔT ≤35 => ΔT ≤ 35/6 ≈5.833, ΔT≤5\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -24 +6ΔT => 6ΔT ≥24 => ΔT ≥4\n\nSo ΔT ≥4 and ΔT ≤5, so ΔT=4 or 5.\n\nAt ΔT=4: Span = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔT=5: [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔT=3: [-35+18,-24+18]=[-17,-6], 0 not in\n\nΔT=6: [-35+36,-24+36]=[1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo on y=6, collision at T=61 (ΔT=4) and T=62 (ΔT=5)\n\nT=57+4=61, T=57+5=62.\n\nNow row y=7: freeway 7, two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4) → Span(T) = [-59 +4ΔT, -48 +4ΔT]\n\n0 in if -59 +4ΔT ≤0 ≤ -48 +4ΔT\n\nFirst: -59 +4ΔT ≤0 => 4ΔT ≤59 => ΔT ≤ 59/4=14.75, ΔT≤14\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 +4ΔT => 4ΔT ≥48 => ΔT ≥12\n\nSo ΔT ≥12 and ΔT ≤14, so ΔT=12,13,14.\n\nAt ΔT=12: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔT=13: [-59+52, -48+52] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nΔT=14: [-59+56, -48+56] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nΔT=11: [-59+44, -48+44]=[-15,-4], 0 not in\n\nΔT=15: [-59+60, -48+60]=[1,12], 0 not in\n\nSecond car on y=7: (16,5,right,4) → head=16, tail=5, dir=right, Span(T) = [5 +4ΔT, 16 +4ΔT]\n\nSince min at ΔT=0 is [5,16] >0, so always positive, 0 never in. So only first car matters.\n\nCollision on y=7 at T=69,70,71 (ΔT=12,13,14)\n\nT=57+12=69, 57+13=70, 57+14=71.\n\nNow row y=8: freeway 8, car (-36,-47,right,3) → Span(T) = [-47 +3ΔT, -36 +3ΔT]\n\n0 in if -47 +3ΔT ≤0 ≤ -36 +3ΔT\n\nFirst: -47 +3ΔT ≤0 => 3ΔT ≤47 => ΔT ≤ 47/3 ≈15.666, ΔT≤15\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -36 +3ΔT => 3ΔT ≥36 => ΔT ≥12\n\nSo ΔT ≥12 and ΔT ≤15, so ΔT=12,13,14,15.\n\nAt ΔT=12: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔT=13: [-47+39, -36+39] = [-8,3], 0 in\n\nΔT=14: [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔT=15: [-47+45, -36+45] = [-2,9], 0 in\n\nΔT=11: [-47+33, -36+33]=[-14,-3], 0 not in\n\nΔT=16: [-47+48, -36+48]=[1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo on y=8, collision at T=69,70,71,72.\n\nT=57+12=69, 70,71,72.\n\nNow, summarize the dangerous times for each row:\n\n- y=1: collision at T=58\n\n- y=2: collision at T=59\n\n- y=3: collision at T=59 (from earlier)\n\n- y=4: collision at T=59\n\n- y=5: same as y=4, collision at T=59\n\n- y=6: collision at T=61,62\n\n- y=7: collision at T=69,70,71\n\n- y=8: collision at T=69,70,71,72\n\nAt other times, no collision for that row.\n\nWe start at t=57, y=3.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, which is above.\n\nThe minimal path might be to go up directly, but we have to avoid being on dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nSince we can stay or move down, but moving down might not help since we need to go up eventually.\n\nLet's see the timeline.\n\nFirst, at t=57: we are on y=3, safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, we choose action a_{57} to go to y_{58}.\n\nPossible actions: U to y=4, D to y=2, S to y=3.\n\nBut at t=58, if we are on y=1,2,3,4,5, some have collisions.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt t=58:\n\n- y=1 has collision (from above)\n\n- y=2: no collision at t=58? Earlier for y=2, collision only at t=59, not at t=58.\n\nFor y=2, at t=59, ΔT=2.\n\nt=58, ΔT=1, for y=2 first car: Span=[-35+12(1), -24+12(1)]=[-23,-12], 0 not in. Second car no, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at t=58, ΔT=1: first car Span=[-35+12,-24+12]=[-23,-12], 0 not in; second no, safe.\n\ny=4 at t=58, ΔT=1: car Span=[48-36,83-36]=[12,47], 0 not in, safe.\n\ny=5 same, safe.\n\ny=6 at t=58, ΔT=1: Span=[-35+6,-24+6]=[-29,-18], 0 not in, safe.\n\ny=7 and y=8, far away, safe at t=58.\n\nSo at t=58, all rows are safe, except y=1 has collision, but we may not be on y=1.\n\nNow, back to choosing a_{57}.\n\nIf we go up, a_{57}=U, then y_{58}=4.\n\nAt t=58, we are on y=4, which is safe at t=58, as above.\n\nThen from there.\n\nIf we stay, a_{57}=S, then y_{58}=3.\n\nAt t=58, y=3 is safe.\n\nIf we go down, a_{57}=D, then y_{58}=2, safe at t=58.\n\nBut going down might delay, so probably not helpful.\n\nSimilarly, staying might not help.\n\nSo let's try to go up.\n\nOption 1: Go up directly as fast as possible.\n\nStart t=57, y=3.\n\nAction a_{57}: U, so y_{58}=4\n\nAt t=58, on y=4, which is safe (since at t=58, no collision on y=4).\n\nThen action a_{58}: if we go U, y_{59}=5\n\nAt t=59, we would be on y=5.\n\nBut y=5 has collision at t=59! From earlier, y=4 and y=5 both have collision at t=59.\n\nAt t=59, on y=5, collision.\n\nIf we stay on y=4 at t=59, but when we choose action at t=58.\n\nAt t=58, on y=4, we choose a_{58}.\n\nIf a_{58}=U, then y_{59}=5, and at t=59, on y=5, collision.\n\nIf a_{58}=S, then y_{59}=4, at t=59, on y=4, which has collision at t=59.\n\nIf a_{58}=D, then y_{59}=3, at t=59, on y=3, which also has collision at t=59.\n\nAt t=59, all of y=2,3,4,5 have collision? y=2,3,4,5 all dangerous at t=59.\n\ny=2: collision at t=59\n\ny=3: collision at t=59\n\ny=4: collision at t=59\n\ny=5: collision at t=59\n\ny=1: not, but y=1 collision only at t=58.\n\nSo at t=59, rows 2,3,4,5 are all occupied at x=0.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on y=2,3,4,5 at turn t=59.\n\nThat means, at t=59, we must be on y=0,1,6,7,8 or 9, but y=9 is goal, probably not yet.\n\ny=0 or 1 or 6,7,8.\n\nBut y=1 has no collision at t=59? y=1 collision only at t=58, at t=59 it should be safe.\n\nFor y=1 at t=59, ΔT=2, Span=[-95+96, -48+96]=[1,48], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at t=59: ΔT=2, for y=6 car, Span=[-35+12, -24+12]=[-23,-12]?

Earlier, y=1 safe at t=59, only unsafe at t=58.\n\nAt t=59, y=1: ΔT=2, Span=[1,48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo a_{58}=D to y=1 at t=59, which is safe.\n\nThen we can go up from there.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nSo one option: go down to y=1 at t=59, safe, then go up.\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\nSince at t=59, we must be on y=0,1,6,7,8.\n\ny=0 is safe, but below.\n\nWe are at y=3 at t=57, so to be on y=6,7,8 at t=59, we need to move up fast.\n\nFrom t=57 to t=59, two actions.\n\nAt t=57, y=3.\n\nAfter two actions, at t=59, y_{59}.\n\ny_{59} = y_{57} + Δy from two actions.\n\nEach action U, D, S changes y by +1,-1,0.\n\nSo min y_{59} = 3 -2 =1 (if both D)\n\nMax y_{59} = 3+2=5 (both U)\n\nBut y=5 unsafe at t=59.\n\nTo be on y=6 at t=59, we need y_{59} =6.\n\nBut from y=3, after two actions, max y=5, cannot reach y=6 in two actions.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 or 8 impossible.\n\ny=1 is possible, as above.\n\ny=0: if we go down twice.\n\nBut y=0 is safe.\n\nNow, y=6,7,8 not reachable from y=3 in two actions.\n\nTherefore, at t=59, the only safe rows we can be on are y=0 or y=1.\n\ny=6,7,8 are too high to reach.\n\ny=0 or 1.\n\nIf we go to y=1 at t=59, as above.\n\nOr to y=0.\n\nBut y=1 is closer to target.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nFirst, to avoid being unsafe at t=59, we need to be on y=0 or 1 at t=59.\n\nSince we start at y=3, we need to move down.\n\nOption: at t=57, go down: a_{57}=D, so y_{58}=2\n\nAt t=58, on y=2, which is safe at t=58.\n\nThen at t=58, go down again: a_{58}=D, so y_{59}=1\n\nAt t=59, on y=1, safe, as established.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=1 at t=59.\n\nNow, we can start going up.\n\nBut there might be later obstacles.\n\nFirst, from y=1 at t=59.\n\nAction a_{59}: we can go U to y=2, or S to y=1, or D to y=0.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\ny=2: is it safe at t=60?\n\nCheck y=2 at t=60.\n\nFor y=2, collision only at t=59, not other times.\n\nAt t=60, ΔT=3, for first car: Span=[-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], 0 not in; second car no, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all other rows safe except as per schedule.\n\nSo at t=60, no particular danger except rows with cars, but from schedule, no collisions at t=60 except possibly, let's see:\n\ny=6 has collision at t=61,62\n\nt=60 is safe for all.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo from y=1 at t=59, we can go up: a_{59}=U, to y_{60}=2\n\nAt t=60, on y=2, safe.\n\nThen a_{60}=U, to y_{61}=3\n\nAt t=61, on y=3.\n\nNow, y=3: collision only at t=59, not at other times.\n\nAt t=61, ΔT=4, first car Span=[-35+48, -24+48]=[13,24], 0 not in; second no, so safe.\n\nThen a_{61}=U, to y_{62}=4\n\nAt t=62, on y=4.\n\ny=4: collision only at t=59, not other times.\n\nAt t=62, ΔT=5, car on y=4: Span=[48-180,83-180]? Left-moving, Span(T)=[48-36ΔT, 83-36ΔT]\n\nΔT=5, [48-180,83-180]=[-132,-97], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 same.\n\nSo a_{61}=U to y=4 at t=62, safe.\n\nThen a_{62}=U to y_{63}=5\n\nAt t=63, on y=5, similarly safe, since no collision except t=59.\n\nThen a_{63}=U to y_{64}=6\n\nAt t=64, on y=6.\n\nNow y=6 has collision at t=61 and t=62.\n\nt=64: ΔT=7, Span for y=6 car: [-35 +6*7, -24+6*7] = [-35+42, -24+42] = [7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen a_{64}=U to y_{65}=7\n\nAt t=65, on y=7.\n\ny=7 has collisions at t=69,70,71, which are later, t=65 is ΔT=8, for first car: Span=[-59+32, -48+32]=[-27,-16], 0 not in; second car [5+32,16+32]=[37,48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen a_{65}=U to y_{66}=8\n\nAt t=66, on y=8.\n\ny=8 has collisions at t=69,70,71,72.\n\nt=66: ΔT=9, Span=[-47+27, -36+27]=[-20,-9], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen a_{66}=U to y_{67}=9\n\nAt t=67, on y=9, safe, done.\n\nNow, we reached y=9 at turn 67.\n\nTotal turns: from t=57 to t=67, that's 10 turns? Let's count the actions.\n\nStart at t=57, y=3.\n\nActions: a57, a58, ..., a66 to reach y67=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=57 to t=67, that's 10 actions? t=57 to t=58: one action, up to t=67: after 10 actions, y_{67}.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=57: action a57=D, to y58=2\n\nt=58: action a58=D, to y59=1\n\nt=59: action a59=U, to y60=2\n\nt=60: action a60=U, to y61=3\n\nt=61: action a61=U, to y62=4\n\nt=62: action a62=U, to y63=5\n\nt=63: action a63=U, to y64=6\n\nt=64: action a64=U, to y65=7\n\nt=65: action a65=U, to y66=8\n\nt=66: action a66=U, to y67=9\n\nAt t=67, y=9, done.\n\nTotal actions: 10 actions, H=10.\n\nBut is this minimal? We had to go down first, which added turns.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly to a safe row without going down.\n\nAt t=59, we need to be on y=0 or 1.\n\nWe could go to y=0 instead.\n\nBut y=1 is higher.\n\nAnother idea: at t=57, we could stay or something, but we saw it forces us to unsafe.\n\nPerhaps we can go up to y=4 or 5 but then at t=59, we need to be on safe row, but we can't reach y=6 in time.\n\nUnless we move faster, but we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo impossible to be above y=5 at t=59 from start.\n\nTherefore, going down to y=1 is necessary to avoid t=59.\n\nBut we might have a shorter path by going up later, but with the obstacles on y=6 at t=61,62 and y=7,8 later.\n\nIn the above path, we pass y=6 at t=64, which is after t=62, so safe.\n\ny=7 at t=65, before t=69, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at t=66, before t=69, safe.\n\nNow, is there a way with fewer than 10 turns?\n\nMinimal is 6 turns, but we have to avoid t=59 and also later times.\n\nSuppose we delay or something.\n\nAnother option: at t=57, go down to y=2, but then at t=58, instead of going down, we could go up? But to where.\n\nAt t=58, if on y=2, and we go up to y=3, but then at t=59 on y=3, unsafe.\n\nIf we stay on y=2 at t=59, unsafe.\n\nOnly down to y=1 safe.\n\nPerhaps go to y=0.\n\nBut similar.\n\nAfter t=59, we can go up fast.\n\nIn the path above, from t=59 to t=67, we go from y=1 to y=9 in 8 turns, but since we started from lower, it took time.\n\nFrom t=57 to t=59, we went from y=3 to y=1, down 2, so to go up 8 to y=9, total 10 turns.\n\nIf we could be at higher y after t=59.\n\nBut at t=59, we can only be at y=0 or 1.\n\ny=1 is better.\n\nNow, later, on y=6, we have to avoid t=61 and t=62.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=6 at t=64, which is fine.\n\nCould we be on y=6 earlier? For example, at t=60 or something.\n\nBut at t=59, we are at y=1, so at t=60, we can be at y=2, then t=61 y=3, etc, same as before.\n\nIf we go up faster, but we can only one step per turn.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we can't.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at t=57, we go up to y=4, but then at t=58, we go down to y=3 or something, but at t=59 we are stuck.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think the above path is necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose we go to y=0 at t=59.\n\nFor example, a57=D to y58=2\n\na58=D to y59=1, same as before.\n\nTo y=0: a57=D to y58=2, a58=S to y59=2, but y=2 unsafe at t=59.\n\na58=D to y59=1, or if y58=2, a58=D to y59=1.\n\nIf we want y59=0, need to go down from y=3 to y=2 to y=1 to y=0, but that takes three downs, at t=57 D to y58=2, t=58 D to y59=1, then to y60=0, but at t=59 we are at y=1, which is safe, and we can go to y=0 later if needed, but not necessary.\n\nGoing to y=0 might be worse.\n\nSo y=1 at t=59 is fine.\n\nNow, in the up path, from y=1 at t=59, we go to y=2 at t=60, y=3 at t=61, etc.\n\nAt t=61, we are on y=3, but y=6 has collision at t=61, but we are not on y=6 yet.\n\nWe reach y=6 at t=64.\n\nBut at t=61, if we were on y=6, it would be unsafe, but we are on y=3.\n\nSimilarly, t=62 on y=4, not y=6.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, later on y=7 and y=8, we are at t=65 and t=66, before the dangerous times t=69-72, so fine.\n\nNow, can we go faster? For example, from y=1 at t=59, if we could go directly, but we can't.\n\nPerhaps skip some rows, but no, must move one step.\n\nAnother thought: when we go up, on y=6, we have to be not at t=61 or 62.\n\nIn our case, t=64 is fine.\n\nBut suppose we go up slower or faster.\n\nFor example, if from y=1 at t=59, we go up immediately to y=2 at t=60, as before.\n\nIf we stay on y=1 at t=60, but that would delay.\n\nFor instance, a59=S, stay on y=1 at t=60, then a60=U to y=2 at t=61, etc, but then we reach later, worse.\n\nSo better to go up fast.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 10 actions.\n\nBut is there a way with 9 actions?\n\nMinimal distance: from y=3 to y=9, difference 6, so min 6 actions if no obstacles.\n\nBut with obstacles, we had to go down to y=1, so net from y=3 to y=1 down 2, then up to y=9 up 8, total 10 actions.\n\nIf we can avoid going down by timing.\n\nBut at t=59, we must not be on y=2,3,4,5, so we have to be below or above, but above not possible, so below.\n\nUnless we can be on y=6 at t=59, but impossible.\n\nSo I think 10 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier by going through other paths, but no, vertical only.\n\nAnother idea: at t=58, if we are on a row where we can go to y=6 or something, but no.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=57, we go up to y=4 at t=58.\n\nThen at t=58, on y=4, safe.\n\nBut at t=59, we need to be safe, so we must move to a safe row, but from y=4, we can only go to y=3,4,5 or if we go down to y=3, but all unsafe at t=59.\n\ny=4 to y=3 is down, or to y=5 up, both unsafe.\n\nWe cannot jump to y=6.\n\nSo impossible to avoid without going down.\n\nTherefore, the sequence I have seems correct.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have actions from t=57 to t=66.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list actions starting from t_1=57.\n\nIn the sequence: a57=D, a58=D, a59=U, a60=U, a61=U, a62=U, a63=U, a64=U, a65=U, a66=U\n\nBut a66=U to y67=9.\n\nNow, H=10 turns.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nStart: turn 57, position y=3.\n\nAfter action a57=D, at turn 58, y=2\n\na58=D, turn 59, y=1\n\na59=U, turn 60, y=2\n\na60=U, turn 61, y=3\n\na61=U, turn 62, y=4\n\na62=U, turn 63, y=5\n\na63=U, turn 64, y=6\n\na64=U, turn 65, y=7\n\na65=U, turn 66, y=8\n\na66=U, turn 67, y=9\n\nYes, at turn 67, y=9.\n\nNow, collision checks:\n\nAt turn 57: y=3, safe\n\nTurn 58: y=2, safe (since y=2 unsafe only at t=59)\n\nTurn 59: y=1, safe\n\nTurn 60: y=2, safe\n\nTurn 61: y=3, safe\n\nTurn 62: y=4, safe\n\nTurn 63: y=5, safe (y=5 collision only t=59)\n\nTurn 64: y=6, at t=64, ΔT=7, Span=[7,18], 0 not in, safe\n\nTurn 65: y=7, at t=65, ΔT=8, Span first car [-27,-16], second [37,48], 0 not in, safe\n\nTurn 66: y=8, at t=66, ΔT=9, Span=[-20,-9], 0 not in, safe\n\nTurn 67: y=9, safe, no check.\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose we go down only once, but we need to be at y=0 or 1 at t=59.\n\nIf at t=57, we go down to y=2 (a57=D), then at t=58, we are on y=2.\n\nIf we go down to y=1 at t=59, as before.\n\nIf at t=58, we go up, to y=3 at t=59, unsafe.\n\nNo choice.\n\nAt t=57, stay: a57=S, y58=3\n\nThen at t=58, on y=3, must go down to y=2 or something, but at t=59 y=2 or y=3 both unsafe.\n\nUnless go to y=1: from y=3 at t=58, a58=D to y59=1, same as before, but we stayed at t=57, so we have an extra stay, which delays, worse.\n\nFor example: t=57 S, y58=3\n\nt=58 D, y59=1\n\nThen from y=1 at t=59, same up sequence, but we have an extra turn at t=57 S, so reach later.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down at t=57 to y=2, then at t=58, if we stay, a58=S, y59=2, unsafe.\n\nMust go down to y=1.\n\nSo no shorter path.\n\nPerhaps after t=59, we can go slower to avoid later obstacles, but in this case, no need, since we pass y=6 after t=62.\n\ny=6 dangerous at t=61,62, we at t=64, fine.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 dangerous at 69-71, we at 65, fine.\n\nSo I think 10 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach y=9 by turn 66 or earlier.\n\nTurn 67 is after 10 actions.\n\nStart turn 57, after 0 actions, at y=3.\n\nAfter 1 action, turn 58, y=?\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 57+k.\n\nWe need y_{57+H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 67, y=9, so 57+H=67, H=10.\n\nCan we have y_{57+H}=9 with H<10?\n\nFor example, H=9, so at turn 66, y=9.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at turn 66, we need to be at y=8 at turn 65 or something.\n\nFrom turn 57 to turn 66, that's 9 turns later? Turn 57 to turn 66 is 9 steps? Let's see.\n\nAfter 0 actions: turn 57, y=3\n\nAfter 1 action: turn 58\n\n...\n\nAfter 9 actions: turn 66\n\nAt turn 66, we want y=9.\n\nSo need to go from y=3 to y=9 in 9 actions, net +6, so possible if no downs, but with downs needed.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 66, we must not have gone down, but we have to avoid t=59.\n\nAt turn 59, which is after 2 actions (since turn 57+2=59), we need to be at y=0 or 1.\n\nAfter 2 actions from turn 57, at turn 59, y_{59}.\n\ny_{59} must be 0 or 1.\n\nBut from y=3, after two actions, min y=1 (if both down), or max y=5.\n\ny=1 is possible, as before.\n\nBut if we go to y=1 at turn 59, then from there to turn 66, that's 7 actions (from turn 59 to 66: actions a59 to a65, 7 actions).\n\nFrom y=1 to y=9, need +8, but in 7 actions, we can gain at most +7, so y=1 +7=8 at turn 66, not 9.\n\nIf we go to y=0 at turn 59, even worse, y=0 +7=7 at turn 66.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 66, we need to be at higher y earlier.\n\nBut at turn 59, we must be at low y.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach y=9 before turn 67.\n\nThus, minimal H=10.\n\nAnd the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have two downs at the beginning.\n\nBut in the answer format, we need to list the actions.\n\nCurrent turn t1=57.\n\nActions: a57, a58, ..., a66.\n\nIn the box.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 3 is same as 2, but we didn't use it, but it's fine.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 57: D\n\nTurn 58: D\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nBut we need to specify for each turn.\n\nAnswer format: for each turn, the action.\n\nFrom t=57 to t=66, but t=66 action leads to y at t=67.\n\nH=10 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1=57, actions from t=57 to t=57+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position.\n\nSet t_1 + H = T, y_T=9.\n\nIn this case, T=67, so t_1 + H =67, 57 + H=67, H=10.\n\nActions at turns 57 to 66.\n\nList:\n\nTurn 57: D\n\nTurn 58: D\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 57 with the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 10, meaning the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 67.\n\n### Key Constraints and Reasoning:\n- **Avoiding Turn 59 Collisions**: At turn 59, freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\) have collisions at \\(x = 0\\). Therefore, the player must not be on these rows at turn 59. The only safe rows at turn 59 are \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y = 1\\), as \\(y = 6, 7, 8\\) are unreachable from \\(y = 3\\) in two moves.\n- **Initial Moves**: From \\(y = 3\\) at turn 57, moving down to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 58 and then to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 59 avoids the turn 59 collision zone.\n- **Later Obstacles**: \n  - Freeway \\(y = 6\\) has collisions at turns 61 and 62. The sequence passes \\(y = 6\\) at turn 64, which is safe.\n  - Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) have collisions from turns 69 to 72. The sequence passes \\(y = 7\\) at turn 65 and \\(y = 8\\) at turn 66, both before the dangerous times.\n- **Efficiency**: Moving down initially adds turns but is necessary to avoid turn 59. After turn 59, moving up continuously reaches \\(y = 9\\) in the minimal time, as no faster path exists due to the constraints.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions are chosen to minimize \\(H\\) while ensuring no collision occurs at any turn. For each turn from 57 to 66, the action determines the player's position at the next turn. Collision checks confirm safety at all steps:\n- Turn 57: On \\(y = 3\\), safe (no collision at turn 57).\n- Turn 58: On \\(y = 2\\), safe (no collision at turn 58).\n- Turn 59: On \\(y = 1\\), safe (no collision at turn 59).\n- Turns 60–66: All positions safe as per car schedules.\n\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}_{t=57}^{66}\\) is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 57: D \\\\\nTurn 58: D \\\\\nTurn 59: U \\\\\nTurn 60: U \\\\\nTurn 61: U \\\\\nTurn 62: U \\\\\nTurn 63: U \\\\\nTurn 64: U \\\\\nTurn 65: U \\\\\nTurn 66: U\n}\n\n**Explanation of Path**:\n- **Turn 57 (action D)**: Move down to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 58.\n- **Turn 58 (action D)**: Move down to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 59 (safe, avoids collision on \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\)).\n- **Turn 59 (action U)**: Move up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 60.\n- **Turn 60 (action U)**: Move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 61.\n- **Turn 61 (action U)**: Move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 62.\n- **Turn 62 (action U)**: Move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 63.\n- **Turn 63 (action U)**: Move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 64 (safe, after collision period).\n- **Turn 64 (action U)**: Move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 65 (safe, before collision period).\n- **Turn 65 (action U)**: Move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 66 (safe, before collision period).\n- **Turn 66 (action U)**: Move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 67 (goal reached, safe).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in 10 turns, which is minimal given the constraints.",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t_1 = 58, and the player is at (0,2). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and at that same turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nThe player's y-position at turn T is denoted y_T. The update is:\n  - U: y_{t+1} = y_t + 1\n  - D: y_{t+1} = y_t - 1\n  - S: y_{t+1} = y_t\n\nWe start at y_58 = 2. We need to end at y_{58+H-1} = 9.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway whose span includes 0 at that exact turn T.\n\nNote: The player is not on the freeway during the move. Specifically, if at turn T the player is at y_T and moves to y_{T+1} (which is different), then at turn T the player is only on freeway y_T, and at turn T+1 the player is only on freeway y_{T+1}. So we only check the freeway at the current turn.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t_1=58. For any future turn T (>=58), we can compute the car's span at turn T by:\n\n  For a car given at turn 58: (head, tail, direction, speed)\n  - If direction is 'right': \n        at turn T, the car's head becomes: head + s*(T-58)\n        and tail becomes: tail + s*(T-58)\n        so the span is [tail + s*(T-58), head + s*(T-58)]? \n\nBut note: in the table, for right-moving cars, the span at t_1 is given as [tau, h] meaning from tail to head? Actually, the representation in the table is:\n\n  For freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48) -> so at turn 58, the car's head is at 0 and tail at -47? \n  But the update for right-moving: \n        Span(58) = [tau, h] = [-47, 0]? \n  Then at turn T: [tau + s*(T-58), h + s*(T-58)] = [-47 + 48*(T-58), 0 + 48*(T-58)]\n\nHowever, note that the problem says for right-moving: \n        Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t_1), head + s*(T-t_1)]? \n  But in the initial state, the head and tail are given as (head, tail) but the representation for right-moving is [tau, head] meaning the tail is the leftmost and head the rightmost? Actually, the problem says:\n\n  For right-moving: \n        Span(t_1) = [tau, h] -> then at T: [tau + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nSo the initial head and tail are given in the order: (head, tail) in the table? Let's see:\n\n  Freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48) -> so head=0, tail=-47? \n        Then the span at t_1 is [tail, head] = [-47, 0]? \n        But the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [tau, h]\" and then moves to [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]. \n\nSo we can compute the position at any T.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving:\n        Span(t_1) = [h, tau] -> then at T: [h - s*(T-t_1), tau - s*(T-t_58)]\n\nExample for freeway 4: (12,47,left,36) -> head=12, tail=47? \n        Then at t_1, the span is [12,47] (since head is at 12 and tail at 47, meaning the car extends from 12 to 47, and it's moving left so the head is at the right and moves left? \n        But the problem says: left-moving: Span(t_1)=[h, tau] -> [12,47]? \n        Then at T: [12 - 36*(T-58), 47 - 36*(T-58)]\n\nBut note: the problem says \"head\" and \"tail\". For left-moving, the head is the rightmost? and tail the leftmost? Actually, the update for left-moving: the entire car moves left, so the head (which was at 12) moves left and the tail (which was at 47) also moves left? That would make the car extend from 12 to 47 at t_1? Then moving left, the numbers decrease.\n\nBut wait: if the car is moving left, then the head (front) is at the left? Or is the head the front? Actually, the problem does not specify. But the update rule is consistent: for left-moving, we subtract the displacement.\n\nThe key point: the car occupies a contiguous set of x-coordinates. The collision condition is: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (so y_T = k) and the car on freeway k has a span that includes 0 at that turn T, then collision.\n\nWe are to compute the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nSince we are only moving vertically and the horizontal position is fixed at 0, we only care about when the player is on a freeway row (1 to 8) and the car on that row at the same turn has 0 in its span.\n\nWe start at (0,2) at turn 58. We need to get to (0,9). The moves are U, D, S. We can plan a path that goes from y=2 to y=9 without colliding.\n\nWe must avoid:\n  For each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each turn T (>=58), if the player is at y_T = k, then we must check all cars on freeway k at turn T: if any car's span at turn T contains 0.\n\nNote: Each freeway has one or more cars. We are given the cars at turn 58.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway k, the times (turns) at which the freeway k is unsafe (i.e., there is a car on freeway k that has 0 in its span at that turn).\n\nWe'll compute for each car on each freeway the times when 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=0, tail=-47, direction='right', speed=48)\n  Right-moving: at turn T, the head position = 0 + 48*(T-58)\n                tail position = -47 + 48*(T-58)\n  We want 0 to be in [tail, head] at turn T? \n        So: tail <= 0 <= head\n        => -47 + 48*(T-58) <= 0 <= 0 + 48*(T-58)\n        The right inequality: 0 <= 48*(T-58) -> T>=58 (always true for T>=58)\n        The left: -47 + 48*(T-58) <= 0 \n                => 48*(T-58) <= 47\n                => T-58 <= 47/48 < 1\n                => T-58 = 0 -> T=58.\n        So only at T=58, the car is at [ -47, 0 ] -> 0 is at the right edge? But note: at T=58, the head is at 0, so 0 is included.\n        Therefore, freeway 1 is unsafe at T=58.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars: \n  Car1: (-12, -23, right, 12) -> head=-12, tail=-23? \n        Actually, the problem says: for right-moving, the span at t_1 is [tau, head] = [-23, -12]? \n        But the input is given as (head, tail) = (-12, -23). \n        So we interpret: head = -12, tail = -23, and the span at t_1 is [tail, head] = [-23, -12]? \n        Then at T: [ -23 + 12*(T-58), -12 + 12*(T-58) ]\n\n        Check when 0 is in this interval:\n          -23 + 12*(T-58) <= 0 <= -12 + 12*(T-58)\n          Left: -23 + 12*(T-58) <= 0 -> 12*(T-58) <= 23 -> T-58 <= 23/12 ≈ 1.916 -> T-58 <= 1 -> T=58,59\n          Right: 0 <= -12 + 12*(T-58) -> 12*(T-58) >= 12 -> T-58>=1 -> T>=59.\n\n        So the two conditions together: T-58>=1 and T-58<=1.916? Actually, we have:\n          T-58 must be at least 1 (from the right) and at most 1.916 (from the left). But T is integer, so T-58=1 -> T=59.\n\n        Therefore, this car is unsafe at T=59? Let's check:\n          At T=58: [ -23, -12] -> 0 not in [-23,-12] -> safe.\n          At T=59: [ -23+12= -11, -12+12=0] -> [-11,0] -> 0 is included (at the right edge) -> unsafe.\n\n        But wait, the right edge is 0? So 0 is included? Yes.\n\n        Now the other car on freeway 2: (60,49,right,12) -> head=60, tail=49? \n        Then the span at t_1: [49,60]? \n        At T: [49+12*(T-58), 60+12*(T-58)]\n\n        Check 0 in [49+12*(T-58), 60+12*(T-58)]:\n          49+12*(T-58) <= 0 <= 60+12*(T-58)\n          The left part: 49+12*(T-58) <=0 -> T-58 <= -49/12 ≈ -4.08 -> impossible for T>=58.\n\n        So this car never covers 0.\n\n        Therefore, freeway 2 is unsafe only at T=59.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? \n  Two cars: (-12,-23,right,12) and (60,49,right,12) -> same as freeway 2.\n  So unsafe only at T=59.\n\nFreeway 4: (12,47,left,36) \n  Left-moving: at T, head becomes 12 - 36*(T-58), tail becomes 47 - 36*(T-58)\n        But note: the problem says for left-moving: \n          Span(t_1)= [head, tail] = [12,47]? \n          Then at T: [12-36*(T-58), 47-36*(T-58)]\n\n        Check 0 in [12-36*(T-58), 47-36*(T-58)]:\n          Lower bound: 12-36*(T-58) <= 0\n          Upper bound: 47-36*(T-58) >= 0\n\n        Lower: 12-36*(T-58) <=0 -> 36*(T-58) >=12 -> T-58>=12/36=1/3 -> T>=58.33 -> so T>=59 (since T integer)\n        Upper: 47-36*(T-58)>=0 -> 36*(T-58)<=47 -> T-58<=47/36≈1.305 -> T-58<=1 -> T<=59.\n\n        So T-58 must be 1 -> T=59.\n\n        Therefore, freeway 4 is unsafe at T=59.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4: (12,47,left,36) -> unsafe at T=59.\n\nFreeway 6: (-18,-29,right,6)\n  Right-moving: head=-18, tail=-29 -> span at t_1: [-29, -18]\n  At T: [-29+6*(T-58), -18+6*(T-58)]\n\n  Check 0 in that interval:\n    -29+6*(T-58) <= 0 <= -18+6*(T-58)\n    Left: -29+6*(T-58)<=0 -> 6*(T-58)<=29 -> T-58<=29/6≈4.833 -> T<=62\n    Right: 0<=-18+6*(T-58) -> 6*(T-58)>=18 -> T-58>=3 -> T>=61\n\n    So T-58 must be between 3 and 4.833 -> T=61,62.\n\n    Therefore, freeway 6 is unsafe at T=61 and 62.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars:\n  Car1: (-44,-55,right,4) -> head=-44, tail=-55 -> span at t_1: [-55,-44]\n        At T: [-55+4*(T-58), -44+4*(T-58)]\n        Check 0: \n          -55+4*(T-58)<=0<=-44+4*(T-58)\n          Left: -55+4*(T-58)<=0 -> 4*(T-58)<=55 -> T-58<=55/4=13.75 -> T<=71\n          Right: 0<=-44+4*(T-58) -> 4*(T-58)>=44 -> T-58>=11 -> T>=69\n          So T in [69, 71.75] -> T=69,70,71? But we must check the interval:\n\n          At T=69: [-55+4*11 = -55+44=-11, -44+44=0] -> [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Yes, at the right edge -> unsafe.\n          At T=70: [-55+48=-7, -44+48=4] -> [-7,4] -> 0 included -> unsafe.\n          At T=71: [-55+52=-3, -44+52=8] -> [-3,8] -> 0 included -> unsafe.\n\n        So unsafe at T=69,70,71.\n\n  Car2: (20,9,right,4) -> head=20, tail=9 -> span at t_1: [9,20]\n        At T: [9+4*(T-58),20+4*(T-58)]\n        Check 0 in [9+4*(T-58),20+4*(T-58)]:\n          9+4*(T-58)<=0 -> 4*(T-58)<=-9 -> impossible for T>=58.\n\n        So only car1 matters.\n\n  Therefore, freeway 7 is unsafe at T=69,70,71.\n\nFreeway 8: (-33,-44,right,3)\n  Right-moving: head=-33, tail=-44 -> span at t_1: [-44,-33]\n  At T: [-44+3*(T-58), -33+3*(T-58)]\n\n  Check 0 in the interval:\n    -44+3*(T-58) <=0<= -33+3*(T-58)\n    Left: -44+3*(T-58)<=0 -> 3*(T-58)<=44 -> T-58<=44/3≈14.666 -> T<=72\n    Right: 0<=-33+3*(T-58) -> 3*(T-58)>=33 -> T-58>=11 -> T>=69\n\n    So T-58 in [11,14.666] -> T=69,70,71,72.\n\n    Therefore, freeway 8 is unsafe at T=69,70,71,72.\n\nSummary of unsafe freeways by turn:\n\nTurn 58: freeway 1 is unsafe (so if we are at freeway 1 at turn 58, we collide). But we start at y=2 (freeway 2? Actually, freeways are rows 1 to 8, and we are at row 2 at turn 58). Freeway 1 is row 1? So we are at row 2 -> safe at turn58.\n\nBut note: at turn58, we are at row2, so we check freeway2: \n  freeway2 at turn58: \n      car1: at T=58: [-23, -12] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n      car2: [49,60] -> safe.\n  So row2 is safe at turn58.\n\nUnsafe turns by row:\n\nRow1: unsafe only at T=58.\nRow2: unsafe at T=59.\nRow3: unsafe at T=59.\nRow4: unsafe at T=59.\nRow5: unsafe at T=59.\nRow6: unsafe at T=61,62.\nRow7: unsafe at T=69,70,71.\nRow8: unsafe at T=69,70,71,72.\n\nWe start at turn58 at row2. We need to get to row9 (which is not a freeway, so no car) and row9 is safe.\n\nWe can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). We must avoid being on a row that is unsafe at the current turn.\n\nWe are at row2 at turn58 -> safe.\n\nOur goal: row9 at some turn. The minimal number of moves? We need to go from row2 to row9: 7 steps up. But we can also move down or stay to avoid unsafe times.\n\nWe need to minimize H (the number of turns including the starting turn? Actually, the sequence is from t_1 to t_1+H-1, so H turns. We start at turn t_1 (58) and then we take H-1 actions? Actually, the sequence of actions is from t_1 to t_1+H-1? The problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. So:\n\n  t = 0: action at t_1 (turn58)\n  t = 1: action at t_1+1 (turn59)\n  ...\n  t = H-1: action at t_1+H-1 (turn58+H-1)\n\nAnd the position at the beginning of turn58 is (0,2). Then after the action at turn58, we get the position at the beginning of turn59? Actually, the update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nWe start at turn58: y58=2. Then we choose a58 -> then y59 = y58 + Delta(a58).\n\nWe want to reach (0,9) at the beginning of some turn T. So we want y_{58+H-1} = 9? Actually, the last action is at turn58+H-2? \n\nLet me clarify:\n\n  Turn58: we are at y58=2. We take action a58 -> then at turn59: y59 = 2 + Delta(a58).\n  ...\n  After H-1 actions, we are at turn58+H-1? \n\nActually, if we take 0 actions: then we are at turn58, and we haven't taken any action. We need to take actions until we are at y=9.\n\nThe problem: we take H actions? The sequence is from t=0 to t=H-1: so we take H actions? Then the state after H actions is at turn58+H. But we want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of a turn? Actually, the position after the last action is the one that must be (0,9). \n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we have y_{t_1+H-1} = 9. \n\nBut note: the action a_{t} is taken at turn t. Then the position at the next turn (t+1) is updated. So:\n\n  At turn t_1: we are at (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,2). \n  Then we take a_{t_1} -> then at turn t_1+1: y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Delta(a_{t_1})\n\n  Then we take a_{t_1+1} -> then at turn t_1+2: y_{t_1+2} = y_{t_1+1} + Delta(a_{t_1+1})\n\n  ...\n\n  After the last action at turn t_1+H-1, we get y_{t_1+H} = y_{t_1+H-1} + Delta(a_{t_1+H-1})\n\nBut we require that at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1, we are at (0,9)? Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1? \n\nNo: the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9)\", and then in the answer format we output actions from turn t_1 to ... until we reach.\n\nBut note: the position at the beginning of turn t_1+H is the result of the last action. However, the problem states: \"y_{t_1+H-1} = 9\" — wait, the index is t_1+H-1? \n\nLet me read: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence is for turns t_1 to t_1+H-1. Then the position after the last action is at turn t_1+H? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t_1+H-1? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we have y_{t_1+H-1} = 9.\n\nBut note: the action a_{t_1} is taken at the beginning of turn t_1, and then we get y_{t_1+1}. So how can y_{t_1+H-1} be 9? \n\nThe state at the beginning of turn t_1 is y_{t_1}. Then:\n\n  After action a_{t_1} (taken at turn t_1), we get y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Delta(a_{t_1}).\n\n  After action a_{t_1+1} (taken at turn t_1+1), we get y_{t_1+2} = y_{t_1+1} + Delta(a_{t_1+1}).\n\n  ...\n\n  After action a_{t_1+H-1} (taken at turn t_1+H-1), we get y_{t_1+H} = y_{t_1+H-1} + Delta(a_{t_1+H-1}).\n\nBut the problem says we want y_{t_1+H-1} = 9? That would mean that at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1 we are at 9, and then we take an action? But we don't care about the state after the last action? \n\nActually, the problem states: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence has H actions. But then the position after H actions is y_{t_1+H}. \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"y_{t_1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nLet me re-read: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd in the answer format, we output:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n...\nTurn t_1+H-1: a_{t_1+H-1}\n\nSo the last action is at turn t_1+H-1, and then the requirement is that at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1 we are at (0,9)? But that doesn't make sense because then we are taking an action at a state that is already the goal? \n\nAlternatively, the requirement is that at the beginning of turn t_1+H we are at (0,9). Then the state after the last action is the goal.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t_1+H-1} = 9\" — which is the state at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1, and then we take an action and then we are at y_{t_1+H} which may not be 9.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking at the problem: \"y_{t_1+H-1} = 9\" — so they require that at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1, the player is at 9. Then we take an action at that turn? But then we might move away? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t_1+H-1. So we are done when we are at (0,9) at the beginning of a turn. We don't need to take an action after that? \n\nHowever, the sequence of actions is from t_1 to t_1+H-1. So the last action is taken at turn t_1+H-1? Then that action would change the position? \n\nBut if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1, and we take an action, then we might leave 9? \n\nThe problem says: we want to reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1. So we must be at 9 at the beginning of that turn, and then we take an action? But we don't care about the next state? \n\nActually, the problem does not say we have to remain at 9. It only says to reach it. But typically, we stop when we reach. However, the sequence includes an action at the turn when we are at 9? \n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we have y_{t_1+H-1}=9. \n\nSo the state at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1 is 9, and then we take the last action a_{t_1+H-1}? \n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1. Then we are done? We don't care what happens after? \n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" — meaning that we must be at (0,9) at the beginning of that turn. Then we can take any action? But we don't care? However, the minimal H is the number of turns we use? \n\nBut note: the goal is to be at (0,9) at the beginning of a turn. So if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn T, then we have reached at turn T. The number of turns we have used is T - t_1 + 1? \n\nWait: at the beginning of turn t_1, we are at (0,2). Then we haven't reached. Then we take actions until we are at (0,9) at the beginning of some turn.\n\nLet T be the turn at which we are at (0,9) at the beginning. Then the number of turns we have been in the game from start (t_1) to T is T - t_1 + 1? But the number of actions taken is T - t_1.\n\nBut the problem says the minimal number of turns H? And the sequence has H actions? Then:\n\n  T = t_1 + H   ??? \n\nBecause:\n  Turn t_1: we start at y58=2 -> take action a58 -> then at turn59: y59 = 2 + Delta(a58)\n  ...\n  After H actions (taken at turns 58,59,...,58+H-1), we get y_{58+H} = ... \n\nBut we want y_{58+H} = 9? Then the beginning of turn58+H we are at 9.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions is from t_1 (58) to t_1+H-1 (58+H-1) and then we have y_{t_1+H-1}=9? \n\nThis implies that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn58+H-1? Then we take an action at turn58+H-1? \n\nI think there is a confusion in indexing.\n\nLooking at the update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nSo the state at turn t+1 is determined by the state at turn t and the action at turn t.\n\nThe state at turn t_1 (58) is given. Then we take action a_{t_1} at turn t_1, which leads to state y_{t_1+1} at turn t_1+1.\n\nWe want to have state 9 at some turn. Let T be the turn at which we are at 9 at the beginning. Then:\n\n  T = t_1 + k   for some k>=0.\n\n  We start at t_1: y_{t_1}=2 -> not 9.\n  Then we take an action at t_1: then we get y_{t_1+1} = 2 + Delta(a_{t_1})\n\n  We want y_T = 9.\n\n  The number of actions taken to get to turn T is T - t_1.\n\n  The sequence of actions is from turn t_1 to turn T-1? \n\n  So the sequence has length H = T - t_1.\n\n  And the turns at which actions are taken: t_1, t_1+1, ..., T-1.\n\n  Then the state at turn T is the result.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is {a_{t_1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so the last action is at t_1+H-1 = t_1 + (T-t_1) - 1 = T-1. Then the state after the last action is at turn T.\n\nAnd the problem requires y_{t_1+H-1} = 9? But that would be y_{T-1} = 9? \n\nBut we want y_T=9? \n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t_1+H-1} = 9\". So they require that at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1 we are at 9. Then we take an action at that turn? \n\nThis is inconsistent with the goal.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the problem statement. Let me read again: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd then: \"y_{t_1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nSo they require that at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1, the player is at 9. \n\nBut then we are taking an action at that turn (a_{t_1+H-1})? And then we move to y_{t_1+H} which is 9+Delta? \n\nThat doesn't make sense for the goal. \n\nAlternatively, the sequence of actions does not include an action at the turn when we are already at the goal? \n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so H actions. \n\nI think the intended meaning is:\n\n  We start at turn t_1 at (0,2). Then we take actions at turns t_1, t_1+1, ... until we are at (0,9) at the beginning of a turn.\n\n  The turn at which we are at (0,9) at the beginning is T. Then the number of actions taken is T - t_1.\n\n  Then H = T - t_1.\n\n  The sequence of actions is for turns: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1? But then the last action is at turn t_1+H-1, and then the state at turn t_1+H is the result.\n\n  We want the state at turn t_1+H to be 9.\n\n  But the problem says: \"y_{t_1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis is a conflict.\n\nTo resolve, let me assume the problem means that we want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t_1+H. Then the number of actions is H, and the actions are taken at turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nThen the state at turn t_1+H is 9.\n\nBut the problem explicitly writes: \"y_{t_1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the indexing is such that the state after H turns of actions is at turn t_1+H, but the problem counts the starting turn as the first turn? \n\nBut then the minimal H would include the starting turn? \n\nI think we should follow the problem: it says the sequence has H actions and then y_{t_1+H-1}=9. \n\nSo we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1, and then we take an action at that turn? \n\nBut then we might move away? \n\nHowever, the problem does not require to stay at 9, only to reach it. So even if we move away in the next action, it's still considered reached at turn t_1+H-1.\n\nBut that seems odd.\n\nLet me check the example: if we are at 9 at turn T, then we have reached. The minimal H should be the number of turns from start to T, and the actions are from turn58 to turn T-1? \n\nBut the problem says the sequence has H actions and the state at turn t_1+H-1 is 9.\n\nIf T = t_1+H-1, then we have reached at turn T = t_1+H-1.\n\nThe number of actions is H = (T - t_1 + 1)? \n\nBut then the actions are taken at turns: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1 = T.\n\nBut then the action at turn T is taken when we are already at 9? \n\nAnd then we move to 9 + Delta(a_T) at turn T+1.\n\nSo to be safe, we should choose action 'S' at the last action so that we stay at 9.\n\nBut the problem does not specify that we have to stay. It only says to reach.\n\nHowever, to be consistent with the requirement that at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1 we are at 9, and then we take an action, we must ensure that the action we take at turn t_1+H-1 is such that we are allowed to be on the freeway of row9? But row9 is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8), so it's always safe.\n\nSo the last action can be anything? But we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1, and then we take an action and move to 10? That would be invalid because y must be in [0,9]. \n\nSo we must choose action 'S' at the last action to stay at 9? Or action 'D' to go to 8? But then we leave 9.\n\nBut the requirement is only to reach 9 at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1, not to stay. And the grid bounds: if we try to go above 9, it's clamped to 9? The problem says: y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we try to go up from 9, we stay at 9.\n\nSimilarly, down from 0 stays at 0.\n\nSo if we are at 9 and we choose 'U', we stay at 9.\n\nTherefore, we can choose any action at the last step? It doesn't matter.\n\nBut the problem says: we only care about being at 9 at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1.\n\nSo the minimal H is the number of turns from the start (turn58) to the turn when we are at 9 (turn T), and then H = T - 58 + 1? Because the turn T is the (T-58+1)-th turn? \n\nBut the actions taken are from turn58 to turn T-1? And the number of actions is T - 58.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence has H actions and then the state at turn58+H-1 is 9.\n\nSo if T = turn when we are at 9 = 58+H-1, then H = T - 58 + 1.\n\nThe number of actions is H = T - 58 + 1.\n\nBut the actions are taken at turns: 58, 59, ..., 58+H-1 = T.\n\nAnd at the beginning of turn T (58+H-1) we are at 9.\n\nAnd then we take an action at turn T.\n\nSo to be safe, we must ensure that at turn T, if we are on a freeway (row9 is not a freeway) then it's safe. But row9 is safe.\n\nSo we can do that.\n\nNow, we need to minimize H, the number of actions. But H = T - 58 + 1, so minimizing H is the same as minimizing the turn T at which we first reach 9.\n\nBut we can also reach 9 earlier and then leave? But the requirement is to be at 9 at the beginning of turn T, so if we reach 9 earlier and then leave and then come back, that would be a larger T.\n\nSo we want the minimal T such that there is a path from y58=2 to y_T=9, and for every turn s in [58, T-1], the state at the beginning of turn s (y_s) is safe (i.e., if y_s is between 1 and 8, then the freeway y_s is safe at turn s).\n\nNote: at turn T, we are at 9 and then we take an action, but that action might move us to 8 or 9 or 10->9, and then at turn T+1 we are somewhere. But we don't care about after T.\n\nSo the journey is from turn58 to turn T (the beginning of turn T we are at 9).\n\nThe actions are taken at turns58 to T-1 (so T-58 actions) but the problem says the sequence has H actions and then we are at 9 at turn58+H-1. So T = 58+H-1 -> H = T - 58 + 1.\n\nWe want to minimize H, so minimize T.\n\nMinimal T: we start at 2 at turn58. We need to get to 9. The minimal number of up moves is 7. But we can also move down and then up, so the minimal number of turns is at least 7. The earliest we can be at 9 is turn58+7 = turn65.\n\nBut we have to avoid unsafe rows at the unsafe turns.\n\nWe want to know if there is a path from y58=2 to y65=9 such that for every turn s from 58 to 64 (the beginning of each turn), the row we are on is safe at that turn.\n\nThe states: we are at row y_s at turn s.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions for s=58 to s=64 (7 actions) that takes us from y58=2 to y65=9.\n\nThe net displacement: 7 up. So we must have exactly 7 more U's than D's? But we can have extra moves that cancel. But we have only 7 actions, so we need exactly 7 U's and 0 D's? Then y59=3, y60=4, y61=5, y62=6, y63=7, y64=8, y65=9.\n\nSo the path: 2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9.\n\nNow, check safety at each turn:\n\n  Turn58: y58=2 -> safe (as we saw: freeway2 safe at turn58)\n  Turn59: y59=3 -> freeway3: unsafe at turn59 (from above) -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot take the direct path at turn59.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeway3 at turn59.\n\nWhat can we do?\n\nOption 1: delay the upward move at turn58: instead of moving up at turn58, we move down or stay, and then later move up faster.\n\nBut we are at 2 at turn58. If we move down to 1 at turn59, then at turn59 we are at freeway1. But freeway1 is only unsafe at turn58, and at turn59: \n  Freeway1: car: at turn59: \n        head = 0 + 48*(59-58) = 48\n        tail = -47+48=1\n        span = [1,48] -> 0 not in [1,48] -> safe.\n  So freeway1 is safe at turn59.\n\nThen at turn59, we are at 1. Then we can move up.\n\nBut we need to get to 9 in as few turns as possible. We are now at turn59 at row1, and we need to get to row9: 8 steps up. So the earliest would be turn59+8=67.\n\nBut we can try to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nWe know that freeways 2,3,4,5 are unsafe at turn59. So we must not be on rows 2,3,4,5 at turn59.\n\nWe start at row2 at turn58. At turn58, we can choose:\n\n  a58 = U -> then at turn59: y59=3 -> unsafe -> collision.\n  a58 = D -> then at turn59: y59=1 -> safe (as computed above).\n  a58 = S -> then at turn59: y59=2 -> unsafe? freeway2 at turn59: we computed unsafe at turn59 -> collision.\n\nSo the only safe move at turn58 is D.\n\nThen at turn59, we are at 1.\n\nAt turn59, we are at row1. What can we do?\n  We need to avoid being on unsafe rows at turn60? \n  We don't have information for freeways at turn60 yet? We only computed for the given unsafe turns.\n\nWe need to compute the safety for all turns in the planning horizon.\n\nBut we want minimal T, so let's try to go as fast as possible.\n\nFrom turn59 at row1, we can move up. But freeway2 is unsafe at turn59? But we are at row1 at turn59, so we are safe.\n\nAt turn59, we choose:\n\n  a59 = U: then at turn60: y60=2.\n  a59 = D: then at turn60: y60=0 -> then we are at 0, which is safe (not a freeway) but then we have to go up from 0, which might take more time.\n  a59 = S: then at turn60: y60=1.\n\nWe want to minimize time, so we try to move up.\n\nSo a59 = U: then at turn60: y60=2.\n\nNow, at turn60: freeway2: we need to check if it's safe.\n\nFreeway2 at turn60:\n  Car1: (-12,-23,right,12): \n        at turn60: T-58=2 -> \n          tail = -23+12*2 = -23+24=1\n          head = -12+24=12\n          span = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n  Car2: (60,49,right,12): \n        tail=49+24=73, head=60+24=84 -> safe.\n\nSo freeway2 at turn60 is safe.\n\nThen at turn60, we are at 2. Then we can move up: a60=U -> then at turn61: y61=3.\n\nAt turn61: freeway3: \n  We computed that freeway3 is unsafe only at turn59? \n  Let me check freeway3 at turn61:\n  Car1: (-12,-23,right,12): \n        T-58=3 -> tail=-23+36=13, head=-12+36=24 -> [13,24] -> safe.\n  Car2: (60,49,right,12): safe as before.\n\nSo freeway3 at turn61 is safe.\n\nThen a61=U -> turn62: y62=4.\n\nAt turn62: freeway4: \n  We had a car: (12,47,left,36): \n        at turn62: T-58=4 -> \n          head = 12 - 36*4 = 12-144 = -132\n          tail = 47-144 = -97\n          span = [-132, -97] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n\nBut wait, we computed that freeway4 was unsafe only at turn59. So at turn62 it is safe.\n\nThen a62=U -> turn63: y63=5.\n\nAt turn63: freeway5: \n  Car: (12,47,left,36): \n        T-58=5: head=12-36*5=12-180=-168, tail=47-180=-133 -> safe.\n\nThen a63=U -> turn64: y64=6.\n\nAt turn64: freeway6: \n  We computed that freeway6 is unsafe at turn61 and 62? But turn64 is safe? \n  Car: (-18,-29,right,6): \n        T-58=6: tail=-29+6*6=-29+36=7, head=-18+36=18 -> [7,18] -> safe.\n\nThen a64=U -> turn65: y65=7.\n\nBut we need to get to 9, and we are at 7 at turn65? We missed.\n\nWe started at turn58:2\n  turn58: D -> turn59:1\n  turn59: U -> turn60:2\n  turn60: U -> turn61:3\n  turn61: U -> turn62:4\n  turn62: U -> turn63:5\n  turn63: U -> turn64:6\n  turn64: U -> turn65:7\n\nWe need two more moves: then turn65: U -> turn66:8, turn66: U -> turn67:9.\n\nSo T = 67: at the beginning of turn67, we are at 9.\n\nThen H = T - 58 + 1 = 67-58+1 = 10? But the number of actions is from turn58 to turn66 (9 actions). \n\nBut the problem says: the sequence has H actions and then at turn58+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nSo if we are at 9 at turn67 = 58+H-1, then 58+H-1=67 -> H=10.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nAlternatively, we might not go down at the beginning. \n\nWe must avoid being on rows 2,3,4,5 at turn59. We start at row2 at turn58.\n\nWe can only go down to row1 at turn59 (safe), as we did.\n\nBut what if we stay at row2 at turn58? That is not safe because at turn58, row2 is safe, but then at turn59 we are still at row2? \n\nAt turn58: if we choose S, then at turn59 we are still at 2. But freeway2 at turn59 is unsafe -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot stay.\n\nAlternatively, we might go up to row3 at turn59, but that is unsafe.\n\nSo the only safe move at turn58 is down.\n\nThen at turn59, we are at row1. Then we go up to row2 at turn60 (which is safe, as we saw).\n\nBut then we are at row2 at turn60. Then we can go up to row3 at turn61 (which is safe).\n\nBut then we are at row3 at turn61. Then we go to row4 at turn62, then row5 at turn63, then row6 at turn64, then row7 at turn65, then row8 at turn66, then row9 at turn67.\n\nThat is 9 actions: from turn58 to turn66.\n\nBut we can try to move faster? We did 7 U moves and 1 D move, net +6, so we end at 8? \n\nWe started at 2, then down to 1, then up to 2, then up to 3,4,5,6,7,8: that's 7 up and 1 down -> net +6, so 2+6=8.\n\nBut we need to get to 9, so we need an additional up move.\n\nSo we need 8 up moves and 1 down move? Then net +7: 2-1+8 = 9. But that would take 9 actions? \n\nAlternatively, we can go up twice in a row sometimes.\n\nBut in the above, we did 8 up moves and 1 down move? Actually, we did 7 up moves and 1 down move: 7U and 1D -> net +6.\n\nTo get net +7, we need 8U and 1D, or 7U and 0D, but we had to do one D at the beginning.\n\nSo total actions: 9 actions: D, then 8 U's.\n\nThen the path:\n\n  turn58: D -> y59=1\n  turn59: U -> y60=2\n  turn60: U -> y61=3\n  turn61: U -> y62=4\n  turn62: U -> y63=5\n  turn63: U -> y64=6\n  turn64: U -> y65=7\n  turn65: U -> y66=8\n  turn66: U -> y67=9\n\nThen at the beginning of turn67, we are at 9.\n\nSo T = 67.\n\nThen H = T - 58 + 1 = 10? But the number of actions is 9. \n\nBut the problem says: the sequence has H actions. And then at turn58+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nSo 58+H-1 = 67 -> H=10.\n\nThe actions are for turns 58 to 67-1=66? So 9 actions? Then H=9? \n\nLet me: \n  H = number of actions = 9.\n  Then turn58+H-1 = 58+9-1 = 66.\n  But we are at 9 at the beginning of turn67, not turn66.\n\nAt the beginning of turn66, we are at y66=8 (from the action at turn65: U from 7 to 8 at turn66).\n\nThen at turn66, we take an action: U, then at turn67 we are at 9.\n\nSo to be at 9 at the beginning of turn67, we must have the state at turn67.\n\nBut the problem requires that at turn58+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nSo if we want to be at 9 at turn66 (which is 58+8), then we set H=9? Then turn58+9-1=66, and we require y66=9.\n\nBut in our plan, at turn66 we are at 8.\n\nSo we need to reach 9 earlier.\n\nHow? We need to be at 9 by turn66.\n\nThat means we have 8 actions (from turn58 to turn65) to go from 2 to 9: net +7.\n\nWe must have at least 7 more up moves than down moves.\n\nWith 8 actions, we can have 7 up and 1 down, or 8 up and 0 down, etc.\n\nBut we have to avoid the unsafe turns.\n\nWe know:\n\n  turn58: we start at 2 -> must go down to 1 (only safe move) -> then at turn59:1.\n\n  Then from turn59 to turn65 (7 actions): we need to go from 1 to 9: +8.\n\n  So we need 8 up moves and 0 down moves in 7 actions? That's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, we might not go down at turn58? But we saw we cannot stay or up.\n\nOr, we might go down at turn58 to 1, and then at turn59, instead of moving up, we move down to 0? \n\nThen at turn59: y59=1 -> we choose D -> then at turn60: y60=0.\n\nThen from 0 at turn60, we can move up to 1 at turn61, then to 2 at turn62, etc.\n\nBut then we are at turn60 at 0, then turn61:1, turn62:2, turn63:3, turn64:4, turn65:5, turn66:6 -> then we need 3 more moves to 9.\n\nThat would be turn69? Worse.\n\nOr, after turn59 at 1, we move up at turn59 to 2, then at turn60 we move up to 3, and so on, but we are at 3 at turn61, and then we can try to go faster by moving up more, but we are limited to one per move.\n\nSo the fastest is to do 8 up moves after the initial down, but that takes 8 moves after turn58, so turn58: down, then 8 ups: then at turn67 we are at 9.\n\nTotal actions: 9 actions (turn58 to turn66) -> then at turn67 we are at 9.\n\nBut we want to be at 9 at turn58+H-1. So if we set H=9, then we require at turn58+9-1=66 we are at 9, but we are at 8.\n\nIf we set H=10, then we require at turn58+10-1=67 we are at 9, and we are.\n\nSo the minimal H is 10.\n\nBut is there a way to be at 9 at an earlier turn? For example, turn66? That would be H=9: turn58+9-1=66.\n\nHow? We need to go from 2 to 9 in 8 actions: net +7.\n\nWe start at turn58:2.\n\nWe must avoid row2,3,4,5 at turn59.\n\nThe only safe move at turn58 is down to 1.\n\nThen at turn59:1.\n\nFrom turn59 to turn65 (7 actions): we need to get to 9 from 1: +8. So we need 8 up moves and 0 down moves -> but we only have 7 actions. Impossible.\n\nAlternatively, we might use a different route that avoids the unsafe rows at the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at turn59, we must not be on rows 2,3,4,5. We are at 1 at turn59 (safe).\n\nThen at turn60, we can be on row2 (safe, as we saw).\n\nThen at turn61, we can be on row3 (safe).\n\nThen at turn62, we are on row4 (safe).\n\nThen at turn63, row5 (safe).\n\nThen at turn64, row6: but freeway6 is unsafe at turn61 and 62, but turn64 is safe.\n\nThen at turn65, row7: freeway7 is unsafe at turn69-71, so turn65 is safe.\n\nThen at turn66, row8: freeway8 is unsafe at turn69-72, so safe.\n\nThen at turn67, row9.\n\nSo we are at row9 at turn67.\n\nBut to get to row9 at turn66, we would need to be at row8 at turn65, then up at turn65 to row9 at turn66.\n\nSo the path:\n\n  turn58: D -> 1\n  turn59: U -> 2\n  turn60: U -> 3\n  turn61: U -> 4\n  turn62: U -> 5\n  turn63: U -> 6\n  turn64: U -> 7\n  turn65: U -> 8\n  turn66: U -> 9\n\nThen at turn66: we are at 9? But this is the beginning of turn66? Then we have taken actions from turn58 to turn65: 8 actions.\n\nThen we are at 9 at the beginning of turn66.\n\nThen for the problem: we want to be at 9 at turn58+H-1.\n\nSo 58+H-1 = 66 -> H=9.\n\nBut in this path, at turn65: we are at 8, and then we take U at turn65 to get to 9 at turn66.\n\nNow, check safety for each turn:\n\n  turn58: y58=2 -> safe.\n  turn59: y59=1 -> safe (freeway1 safe at turn59).\n  turn60: y60=2 -> freeway2 at turn60: safe (as computed: [1,12] for car1, and car2 safe).\n  turn61: y61=3 -> freeway3 at turn61: safe (car1: [13,24], car2 safe).\n  turn62: y62=4 -> freeway4 at turn62: \n        car: (12,47,left,36): head=12-36*4=12-144=-132, tail=47-144=-97 -> safe.\n  turn63: y63=5 -> freeway5: same car: head=12-36*5=-168, tail=47-180=-133 -> safe.\n  turn64: y64=6 -> freeway6: car (-18,-29,right,6): \n        at turn64: T-58=6 -> tail=-29+36=7, head=-18+36=18 -> [7,18] -> 0 not in [7,18] -> safe.\n  turn65: y65=7 -> freeway7: at turn65: \n        car1: (-44,-55,right,4): \n             T-58=7 -> tail=-55+4*7=-55+28=-27, head=-44+28=-16 -> [-27,-16] -> safe.\n        car2: (20,9,right,4): [9+4*7=9+28=37, 20+28=48] -> safe.\n  turn66: we are at 9 -> safe.\n\nSo the entire path is safe.\n\nTherefore, we can be at 9 at turn66.\n\nThen H = 9, since we take 8 actions: from turn58 to turn65.\n\nThe sequence:\n\n  turn58: D\n  turn59: U\n  turn60: U\n  turn61: U\n  turn62: U\n  turn63: U\n  turn64: U\n  turn65: U\n  turn66: not an action in the sequence? \n\nBut we only have 8 actions? \n\nThe actions are for turns 58 to 58+8-1=65.\n\nThe states:\n\n  Start: turn58: y58=2\n  a58: D -> y59=1\n  a59: U -> y60=2\n  a60: U -> y61=3\n  a61: U -> y62=4\n  a62: U -> y63=5\n  a63: U -> y64=6\n  a64: U -> y65=7\n  a65: U -> y66=8\n\nBut we are at 8 at turn66, not 9.\n\nMistake: we have 8 actions, but we need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn66.\n\nTo be at 9 at turn66, we must have y66=9.\n\nSo the last action (at turn65) must be U and we must be at 8 at turn65.\n\nBut in our plan, at turn65 we are at 7 (because from turn64: y64=6, then a64=U -> y65=7, then a65=U -> y66=8).\n\nWe need to be at 8 at turn65 to then go to 9 at turn66.\n\nHow? We need to be at 8 at turn65.\n\nFrom 1 at turn59, we need to get to 8 at turn65: that's 7 moves: from 1 to 8: 7 up moves.\n\nSo:\n\n  turn59:1\n  turn60: U ->2\n  turn61: U ->3\n  turn62: U ->4\n  turn63: U ->5\n  turn64: U ->6\n  turn65: U ->7\n\nThen we are at 7 at turn65. Then we need one more up move to get to 8 at turn66, not 9.\n\nTo get to 9 at turn66, we need to be at 8 at turn65, then U to 9 at turn66.\n\nBut we are at 7 at turn65.\n\nWe need an extra up move somewhere.\n\nWe have only 7 moves from turn59 to turn65 (6 actions: turn59 to turn64) to get from 1 to 8? \n\nLet me count the actions from turn59 to turn65:\n\n  Actions at: turn59, turn60, turn61, turn62, turn63, turn64, turn65: 7 actions.\n\nWe start at turn59:1.\n\nAfter 7 actions of U: we go to 1+7=8 at turn66.\n\nBut we want to be at 9 at turn66, so we would need 8 up moves in 7 actions? impossible.\n\nSo to be at 9 at turn66, we must be at 8 at turn65, and then U at turn65.\n\nSo we need to be at 8 at the beginning of turn65.\n\nFrom 1 at turn59 to 8 at turn65: we have actions at turn59,60,61,62,63,64: 6 actions.\n\nWe need to go from 1 to 8: +7, so we need 7 up moves in 6 actions? That requires 7 ups and 0 downs, which is impossible in 6 actions.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be at 9 at turn66.\n\nThe earliest is turn67.\n\nAnd we have a safe path to turn67:\n\n  turn58: D -> y59=1\n  turn59: U -> y60=2\n  turn60: U -> y61=3\n  turn61: U -> y62=4\n  turn62: U -> y63=5\n  turn63: U -> y64=6\n  turn64: U -> y65=7\n  turn65: U -> y66=8\n  turn66: U -> y67=9\n\nThen at turn67: we are at 9.\n\nNumber of actions: 9 (turns58 to 66).\n\nThen H = 9? But then we require at turn58+H-1 = 58+9-1=66 we are at 9? But we are at 8 at turn66.\n\nIf we set H=10, then turn58+10-1=67, and we are at 9 at turn67.\n\nAnd the actions are from turn58 to turn66 (9 actions) for H=10? \n\nThe problem says: the sequence has H actions. So for H=10, we have 10 actions.\n\nBut we only have 9 actions in the above.\n\nWe need one more action? \n\nAt turn67, we are at 9. We don't need to take an action after that? \n\nBut the problem requires a sequence of H actions and then the state at turn58+H-1=67 (if H=10) is 9.\n\nSo the last action is at turn67-1=66, and then the state at turn67 is the result of that action.\n\nBut in our plan, the action at turn66 is U, and then at turn67 we are at 9.\n\nSo the actions are:\n\n  turn58: D\n  turn59: U\n  turn60: U\n  turn61: U\n  turn62: U\n  turn63: U\n  turn64: U\n  turn65: U\n  turn66: U\n\nThat's 9 actions.\n\nThen H=9? But then turn58+9-1=66, and we require y66=9, but we are at 8 at turn66.\n\nIf we take the action at turn66: U, then at turn67 we are at 9, but turn67 is not turn66.\n\nSo to have y_{67}=9, we need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn67, which is after the action at turn66.\n\nBut the problem requires the state at turn58+H-1 to be 9.\n\nSo if we want that to be turn67, then 58+H-1=67 -> H=10.\n\nThen the sequence has 10 actions: from turn58 to turn67-1=66? But that is 9 actions.\n\n58 to 66 inclusive is 9 turns: 58,59,...,66.\n\nSo 9 actions.\n\nBut H=10 requires 10 actions.\n\nSo we need 10 actions? \n\nWe are at 2 at turn58.\nAfter 10 actions, we are at turn68: \n  y68 = 2 + net displacement.\n\nWe need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn67? And then we take an action at turn67? \n\nBut the problem requires the state at turn58+H-1 to be 9.\n\nIf H=10, then turn58+10-1=67, so we want y67=9.\n\nThen the actions are for turns58 to 66 (9 actions) that get us to y67=9.\n\nSo the last action (at turn66) must be such that from y66 we move to 9.\n\nBut y66 is either 8 or 10? \n\nIf y66=8, then U ->9.\nIf y66=10 -> then we cannot, because we would clamp to 9? But that would be moving from 10 to 9? But we can only move one step.\n\nSo we must be at 8 at turn66, then U to 9 at turn67.\n\nSo the plan we have is exactly that.\n\nBut then the sequence of actions has 9 actions: turns58 to 66.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence has H=10 actions? \n\nThis is a problem.\n\nPerhaps the problem counts the turns differently.\n\nAnother possibility: the minimal turns H is the number of turns that have passed, including the starting turn? \n\nFor example, at turn58, we have spent 1 turn? But we haven't taken any action yet.\n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence of actions for H turns.\n\nPerhaps H is the number of turns from start to finish, including the start.\n\nThen at turn58, we are at turn1 of the journey? \n\nBut then the state at turn58 is the start, and then after H turns, we are at turn58+H-1? \n\nThis is messy.\n\nLet me assume that the problem means that we start at turn58 and we take actions for H turns, and then at the next turn (turn58+H) we are at 9. But the problem says we are at 9 at turn58+H-1.\n\nTo resolve, let's output the sequence for our plan and set H=9 actions, and state that at turn67 we are at 9, but the problem wants turn58+H-1=67 for H=9? that gives 58+9-1=66, not 67.\n\nIf we set H=10 for the number of actions, then we have 10 actions, which would take us to turn68.\n\nBut we can easily add an extra action: at the end, we can do a 'S' at turn67.\n\nThen the actions are 10: from turn58 to turn67.\n\nThen the state after the last action is at turn68: y68 = 9 + Delta(a67) = 9+0=9.\n\nBut we are at 9 at turn68.\n\nThen for the problem: we want at turn58+H-1 = 58+10-1=67 to be 9? But at turn67 we are at 9 (because the action at turn66 got us to 9 at turn67, and then at turn67 we do S, and then at turn68 we are still at 9).\n\nBut at the beginning of turn67, we are at 9. So if we set H=10, then we require y_{58+10-1}=y67=9, which is true.\n\nAnd the actions are:\n\n  turn58: D\n  turn59: U\n  turn60: U\n  turn61: U\n  turn62: U\n  turn63: U\n  turn64: U\n  turn65: U\n  turn66: U   -> this gets us to 9 at turn67.\n  turn67: S   -> to stay at 9.\n\nThen the state at turn67 (which is the beginning of turn67) is 9, and then we take action S at turn67, and then at turn68 we are still at 9.\n\nBut the problem only requires to be at 9 at turn58+H-1=67.\n\nSo this satisfies.\n\nAnd H=10.\n\nBut is there a plan with H=9? \n\nIf we set H=9, then we require y_{58+9-1}=y66=9.\n\nHow to achieve that?\n\nWe need to be at 9 at turn66.\n\nFrom 2 at turn58 to 9 at turn66: 8 actions.\n\nNet +7.\n\nWe start at 2.\n\nWe must not be on rows 2,3,4,5 at turn59.\n\nThe only safe move at turn58 is down to 1.\n\nThen at turn59:1.\n\nThen we have 7 actions (turn59 to turn65) to go from 1 to 9: net +8.\n\nThat requires at least 8 up moves in 7 actions, impossible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 10.\n\nSo the sequence of 10 actions:\n\n  turn58: D\n  turn59: U\n  turn60: U\n  turn61: U\n  turn62: U\n  turn63: U\n  turn64: U\n  turn65: U\n  turn66: U\n  turn67: S   (or U or D, but to be safe and not move, we choose S)\n\nBut do we need the last action? We are at 9 at turn67, and then we can choose any action. Choosing S is fine.\n\nBut is there a way to avoid the last action? \n\nIf we set the last action to be at turn66 and then we are at 9 at turn67, and we don't need an action after that, but the sequence must have H=10 actions, so we must include an action at turn67.\n\nSo we output 10 actions.\n\nAlternatively, we might not need to do the last action if we are already at 9, but the problem asks for a sequence of exactly H actions.\n\nSo we do.\n\nNow, we must check safety for turn67: when we are at 9 at the beginning of turn67, and then we take action S. \n  At turn67: we are at 9 -> safe (not a freeway).\n  The action S doesn't move us, so we are still at 9 at turn68.\n\nBut the problem doesn't require anything beyond turn67.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\nThe sequence:\n\n  turn58: D\n  turn59: U\n  turn60: U\n  turn61: U\n  turn62: U\n  turn63: U\n  turn64: U\n  turn65: U\n  turn66: U\n  turn67: S\n\nBut let me verify safety for the last few turns:\n\n  turn65: y65=7 -> freeway7 at turn65: \n        T-58=7: \n          car1: (-44,-55,right,4): tail=-55+4*7=-55+28=-27, head=-44+28=-16 -> [-27,-16] -> safe.\n          car2: (20,9,right,4): tail=9+28=37, head=20+28=48 -> safe.\n\n  turn66: y66=8 -> freeway8 at turn66: \n        car: (-33,-44,right,3): \n             T-58=8: tail=-44+3*8=-44+24=-20, head=-33+24=-9 -> [-20,-9] -> safe.\n\n  turn67: we are at 9 -> safe.\n\nAnd the action at turn66: U from 8 to 9 -> valid.\n\nSo the entire path is safe.\n\nBut is there a faster path? We have H=10, but is there a path with H=9? \n\nH=9 means we are at 9 at turn58+9-1=66.\n\nWe need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn66.\n\nAs we've seen, it's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, we might take a different path that goes to row0 or something to avoid the unsafe turn59 for rows2-5, but then we have to go up from 0, which takes more steps.\n\nFor example:\n\n  turn58: D ->1\n  turn59: D ->0   (at turn59: freeway1 safe, so D is safe)\n  turn60: U ->1\n  turn61: U ->2\n  turn62: U ->3\n  turn63: U ->4\n  turn64: U ->5\n  turn65: U ->6\n  turn66: U ->7\n\nThen we are at 7 at turn66, not 9. Then we need two more steps.\n\nThat is worse.\n\nOr, after turn59 at 0, we can move up faster, but still we are behind.\n\nSo the minimal H is 10.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 58: D\nTurn 59: U\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: U\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: U\nTurn 66: U\nTurn 67: S\n}\n\nBut the last action can be anything, but 'S' is fine.\n\nNote: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so for t from 0 to 9 (since H=10, t=0,...,9), corresponding to turns 58 to 67.\n\nYes.\n\nSo we output.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn 58, while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 10. The sequence of actions from turn 58 to turn 67 (i.e., \\(a_{58}\\) to \\(a_{67}\\)) ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at the beginning of turn 67 (which is turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 58 + 10 - 1 = 67\\)).\n\n### Path and Safety Verification:\n- **Turn 58 (start):** Player at \\(y = 2\\).

Action: \\(S\\) (stay, though any action is acceptable as the goal is reached).\n\n### Explanation:\n- The initial move down at turn 58 avoids collision on freeway 2 at turn 59 (which is unsafe for freeways 2–5).\n- Subsequent upward moves are timed to avoid all unsafe freeways at critical turns (e.g., freeway 6 unsafe at turns 61–62, freeways 7–8 unsafe at turns 69–72, which do not affect this path).\n- The net displacement is \\(+7\\) (from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 9\\)), achieved with 8 up actions and 1 down action over 9 state transitions, but the sequence requires 10 actions to satisfy the requirement of being at \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 67\\).\n- The final action at turn 67 is \\(S\\) (stay) to remain at \\(y = 9\\), though \\(U\\) or \\(D\\) would also clamp to \\(y = 9\\) or \\(y = 8\\) (but the goal is already met at the start of turn 67).\n\nThis sequence minimizes \\(H\\) to 10, as paths with \\(H < 10\\) cannot reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 66 while avoiding collisions (due to the unsafe turn 59 on freeways 2–5 and the net \\(+7\\) displacement requirement).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 58:  D \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 59:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 60:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 61:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 62:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 63:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 64:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 65:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 66:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 67:  S \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

So at τ=0, y=2.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens if at turn T, the player is on some y between 1 and 8, and for that y, there is a car whose span includes 0 at that turn. The span is the position on the x-axis, I assume, since it's a grid and cars are moving horizontally.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if the player is at (0, y_T), and y_T is between 1 and 8, then for that freeway y_T, if there is a car with span such that 0 is in [head - s*(T-t1), tail - s*(T-t1)] for left-moving, or [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)] for right-moving. Since t1 is 60, T is the absolute turn.\n\nBut to simplify, since we're starting from t1=60, I can define time relative to t1. Let t be the number of turns since t1, so at time t=0, it's turn 60.\n\nThen at time t, the player position y_t, with y_0 = 2.\n\nFor a car given at t1=60, with head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nThen at time t (after t turns), the car's position:\n\nIf left-moving (d = left), span at time t is [h - s*t, τ - s*t]\n\nIf right-moving (d = right), span at time t is [τ + s*t, h + s*t]\n\nBecause at t=0, it's [h, τ] for left? No, let's see the update.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\nAt T=t1, Span = [h - s*0, τ - s*0] = [h, τ], so for left-moving, head and tail are both decreasing.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nAt T=t1, Span = [τ +0, h+0] = [τ, h], so for right-moving, tail is left, head is right, I think, so [tail, head] with tail < head? But in the list, for example, freeway 1: (96,49,right,48), so head=96, tail=49? But 96>49, so for right-moving, if head > tail, then at t1, span is [tail, head] = [49,96] for freeway 1.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 1: (96,49,right,48), so h=96, τ=49, d=right, s=48.\n\nSince d=right, at time t (from t1), span = [τ + s*t, h + s*t] = [49 + 48t, 96 + 48t]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 4: (-60,-25,left,36), so h=-60, τ=-25, d=left, s=36.\n\nThen span at time t = [h - s*t, τ - s*t] = [-60 -36t, -25 -36t]\n\nCollision at time t if the player is at y_t (between 1 and 8), and for that freeway k=y_t, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at time t.\n\nAlso, note that if the player moves to a different y at turn t, they are not on that y until the next turn? Let's read carefully.\n\nFrom the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn T based on where the player is at that turn.\n\nPlayer position at turn T is y_T.\n\nAt turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and collision happens if y_T between 1 and 8 and for some car on freeway y_T, 0 is in Span(T) for that car.\n\nWhen the player moves, at turn T, they choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nBut for collision at turn T, it's based on y_T, not y_{T+1}.\n\nThe note says: if at turn T, you move to a different y (so y_{T+1} ≠ y_T), then at turn T, you are still on y_T, and you leave y_T to go to y_{T+1}, so at turn T, you are on y_T for collision purposes, and at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nSimilarly, if you stay, y_{T+1} = y_T, so you are on the same freeway.\n\nThe note clarifies that when you move, at the moment of moving, you are not yet on the new freeway, so you don't collide with cars there at that turn.\n\nBack to the task: start at y=2, need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and since it's not a freeway (freeways are y=1 to 8), no cars on y=9 or y=0, so no collision there.\n\nWe need to go from y=2 to y=9, moving through y=3 to y=8, avoiding collisions when on those levels.\n\nMinimal number of turns H, meaning the number of actions, so from t=0 to t=H-1, with y_H = 9.\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} = 9, and actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nAt time t, after t actions, position y_t.\n\ny_0 = 2 at t=0 (turn 60)\n\nAfter first action at t=0, y_1 is set, and so on, up to after H actions, y_H = 9.\n\nThe sequence is actions a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so after H actions, we are at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut the position at turn T is before action or after? Let's see the dynamics.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at time t, position y_t, then we choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it's based on y_T.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T, then we choose a_T, which affects y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T based on y_T.\n\nIf y_T between 1 and 8, and for freeway y_T, 0 is in some car's span at time T.\n\nTime T is absolute turn.\n\nIn terms of relative time, at time t (t=0,1,2,...), turn is t1 + t = 60 + t.\n\nPosition y_t at time t.\n\nFor car span at time t, it depends on t, since t = T - t1.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions a_t for t=0 to H-1 such that y_H = 9, and for all τ from 0 to H-1, at position y_τ, if y_τ between 1 and 8, no collision, meaning for freeway y_τ, 0 not in any car span at time τ.\n\nAnd minimize H.\n\nSince we start at y=2, which is freeway 2, so we need to avoid collision at t=0 if on freeway with car at 0.\n\nFirst, let's list all freeways and their cars at time t relative to t1=60.\n\nFreeway k=1 to 8.\n\nFor each, the cars are given.\n\nI need to find for each freeway, at what times t the span includes 0, so that if the player is on that freeway at time t, collision occurs.\n\nThen for the player path, we need that for each time t, if y_t = k between 1 and 8, then at time t, freeway k has no car with 0 in span.\n\nAlso, y_t must be integer between 0 and 9.\n\nStart at y0=2, goal y_H=9.\n\nSince we can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, to go from 2 to 9, minimum H is 7, if we go up every turn: U,U,U,U,U,U,U, so y:2→3→4→5→6→7→8→9, in 7 actions, H=7, from t=0 to t=6, y7=9.\n\nBut we need to check if this path has collisions at any point.\n\nWe might need to wait or go down sometimes to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's analyze each freeway to find when 0 is occupied.\n\nDefine for each freeway k, the set of times t when 0 is in some car's span on that freeway.\n\nSince t is discrete, we can find for each k, the times t where collision occurs if on k at t.\n\nThen for the player, we need that at each time t, if y_t = k, then t not in collision set for k.\n\nAlso, y_t must be defined for t=0 to H, with y0=2, y_H=9.\n\nH is the number of actions, so from t=0 to t=H-1 actions, positions from y0 to y_H.\n\ny_t for t=0 to H.\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t is chosen at time t, affecting y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision at time t, it depends on y_t.\n\nNow, let's list all cars.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car: (96,49,right,48)\n\nd=right, so span at time t: [τ + s t, h + s t] = [49 + 48t, 96 + 48t]\n\n0 is in span if 49 + 48t <= 0 <= 96 + 48t\n\nSince 49+48t <= 96+48t always true, so 49 + 48t <= 0 and 0 <= 96 + 48t\n\nBut 96 + 48t > 0 for all t>=0, since t>=0, 48t>=0, 96>0.\n\n49 + 48t <=0? 48t <= -49, t <= -49/48 ≈ -1.02, since t>=0, 49+48t >=49>0, so 0 < 49+48t <= 96+48t, so 0 is never <= 49+48t because 49+48t >0, so 0 not in [49+48t, 96+48t] for t>=0.\n\nThus on freeway 1, no car at 0 for any t>=0.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars: (12,1,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (12,1,right,12), d=right, span [τ + s t, h + s t] = [1 + 12t, 12 + 12t]\n\n0 in span if 1+12t <=0 <=12+12t\n\n1+12t <=0: 12t <= -1, t <= -1/12 <0, not for t>=0\n\n0 <=12+12t always true for t>=0\n\nBut since 1+12t >=1>0 for t>=0, so 0 < 1+12t <= 12+12t, so 0 not in [1+12t,12+12t]\n\nSecond car: (-36,-47,right,12), d=right, span [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-47 + 12t, -36 + 12t]\n\n0 in span if -47 +12t <=0 <= -36 +12t\n\n-47 +12t <=0: 12t <=47, t <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so t<=3\n\n0 <= -36 +12t: 36 <=12t, t>=3\n\nSo both: t<=3 and t>=3, so t=3\n\nAt t=3, -47+12*3 = -47+36= -11 <=0? -11 <=0 true, 0 <= -36+36=0, 0<=0 true, so yes, 0 in span at t=3.\n\nFor other t, not both satisfied.\n\nSo on freeway 2, collision at t=3 only, from the second car.\n\nFirst car no issue.\n\nSo freeway 2 has collision only at t=3.\n\nNow freeway 3: similar to freeway 2, same cars: (12,1,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nExactly the same as freeway 2.\n\nSo collision only at t=3.\n\nNow freeway 4: one car: (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nd=left, span [h - s t, τ - s t] = [-60 -36t, -25 -36t]\n\n0 in span if -60 -36t <= 0 <= -25 -36t\n\n-60 -36t <=0 always true since both negative\n\n0 <= -25 -36t? -25 -36t <=0 for all t, and <= -25 <0, so 0 <= negative number? False, since -25-36t <0.\n\nThus 0 not in span for any t.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as freeway 4: (-60,-25,left,36), same, no collision.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car: (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nd=right, span [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-17 + 6t, -6 + 6t]\n\n0 in span if -17 +6t <=0 <= -6 +6t\n\n-17 +6t <=0: 6t <=17, t <= 17/6 ≈ 2.833, so t<=2\n\n0 <= -6 +6t: 6 <=6t, t>=1\n\nSo both: t<=2 and t>=1, so t=1 or t=2.\n\nAt t=1: -17+6= -11 <=0, 0 <= -6+6=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nAt t=2: -17+12= -5 <=0, 0 <= -6+12=6, 0<=6 true.\n\nAt t=0: -17 <=0 true, but 0 <= -6? false.\n\nt=3: -17+18=1>0, so -17+6t=1>0, so 0 not <= lower bound.\n\nSo collision at t=1 and t=2.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars: (-36,-47,right,4) and (28,17,right,4)\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,4), d=right, span [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-47 + 4t, -36 + 4t]\n\n0 in span if -47 +4t <=0 <= -36 +4t\n\n-47+4t <=0: 4t<=47, t<=47/4=11.75, t<=11\n\n0 <= -36+4t: 36<=4t, t>=9\n\nSo both: t<=11 and t>=9, so t=9,10,11.\n\nAt t=9: -47+36= -11<=0, 0<= -36+36=0 true\n\nt=10: -47+40= -7<=0, 0<= -36+40=4 true\n\nt=11: -47+44= -3<=0, 0<= -36+44=8 true\n\nt=8: -47+32= -15<=0, but 0 <= -36+32= -4? 0<= -4 false\n\nt=12: -47+48=1>0, not <=0\n\nSecond car: (28,17,right,4), span [17 + 4t, 28 + 4t]\n\n0 in span? 17+4t <=0? 17+4t >=17>0, so 0 not in [17+4t,28+4t]\n\nSo only first car causes collision at t=9,10,11.\n\nThus freeway 7 has collision at t=9,10,11.\n\nNow freeway 8: one car: (-27,-38,right,3)\n\nd=right, span [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-38 + 3t, -27 + 3t]\n\n0 in span if -38 +3t <=0 <= -27 +3t\n\n-38+3t <=0: 3t<=38, t<=38/3≈12.666, t<=12\n\n0 <= -27+3t: 27<=3t, t>=9\n\nSo both: t<=12 and t>=9, so t=9,10,11,12.\n\nAt t=9: -38+27= -11<=0, 0<= -27+27=0 true\n\nt=10: -38+30= -8<=0, 0<= -27+30=3 true\n\nt=11: -38+33= -5<=0, 0<= -27+33=6 true\n\nt=12: -38+36= -2<=0, 0<= -27+36=9 true\n\nt=13: -38+39=1>0, not <=0\n\nSo collision at t=9,10,11,12.\n\nNow, summarize collision times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: never\n\n- Freeway 2: t=3\n\n- Freeway 3: t=3\n\n- Freeway 4: never\n\n- Freeway 5: never\n\n- Freeway 6: t=1,2\n\n- Freeway 7: t=9,10,11\n\n- Freeway 8: t=9,10,11,12\n\nWe start at y0=2, which is freeway 2.\n\nAt t=0, on freeway 2, collision only at t=3, not at t=0, so safe.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimum path: go up directly: y_t for t=0 to 7: y0=2, y1=3, y2=4, y3=5, y4=6, y5=7, y6=8, y7=9.\n\nNow check for each t, if on freeway, collision.\n\nt=0: y=2, freeway 2, collision at t=3 only, not t=0, so safe.\n\nt=1: y=3, freeway 3, collision at t=3 only, not t=1, safe.\n\nt=2: y=4, freeway 4, no collision ever, safe.\n\nt=3: y=5, freeway 5, no collision, safe.\n\nt=4: y=6, freeway 6, collision at t=1,2, not t=4, safe.\n\nt=5: y=7, freeway 7, collision at t=9,10,11, not t=5, safe.\n\nt=6: y=8, freeway 8, collision at t=9,10,11,12, not t=6, safe.\n\nt=7: y=9, not a freeway, no collision.\n\nSo in this path, all safe, and H=7.\n\nBut is that possible? t=3: y=5, which is freeway 5, no cars or no collision.\n\nFreeway 5 has a car but no collision as we saw.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=3, we are at y=5, which is fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the times.\n\nt is relative to t1=60.\n\nAt t=3, absolute turn 63, freeway 5, car on freeway 5 is (-60,-25,left,36), span at t=3: h - s t = -60 -36*3 = -60-108= -168, τ - s t = -25 -108= -133, so span [-168,-133], 0 not in, yes.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut in the direct path, we go through t=0 to t=6 on freeways, all safe at those times.\n\nt=0: y=2 safe\n\nt=1: y=3 safe\n\nt=2: y=4 safe\n\nt=3: y=5 safe\n\nt=4: y=6 safe (since collision only t=1,2)\n\nt=5: y=7 safe (collision t=9-11)\n\nt=6: y=8 safe (collision t=9-12)\n\nt=7: y=9, done.\n\nSo with H=7, actions: U,U,U,U,U,U,U from t=0 to t=6.\n\nt=0 to t=6, 7 actions.\n\nBut the player starts at y0=2, after a0=U, y1=3, ..., after a6=U, y7=9.\n\nNow, but in the freeway 6, at t=4, y=6, is it safe? Freeway 6 collision at t=1 and t=2, not t=4, yes.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut is there a problem with freeway 3? At t=1, y=3, freeway 3 collision only at t=3, so at t=1, no collision.\n\nIn the path, at t=1, we are at y=3, which is fine.\n\nBut let me list the actions:\n\nTurn 60: a_{60} = U (to go to y=3)\n\nIn the sequence, actions a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt1=60, so a_{60} for t=0, a_{61} for t=1, etc.\n\nAfter a_{60}, position at turn 61 is y=3.\n\nCollision at turn T based on y_T.\n\nAt turn 60: y=2, freeway 2, no collision at t=0 (relative).\n\nTurn 61: y=3, freeway 3, no collision at relative t=1.\n\nTurn 62: y=4, freeway 4, no collision.\n\nTurn 63: y=5, freeway 5, no collision.\n\nTurn 64: y=6, freeway 6, no collision at relative t=4.\n\nTurn 65: y=7, freeway 7, no collision at t=5.\n\nTurn 66: y=8, freeway 8, no collision at t=6.\n\nTurn 67: after action, but at turn 67, position y=9, which is goal, and not a freeway.\n\nThe position when we reach y=9 is at turn t1 + H, I think.\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} =9? Let's see.\n\nThe problem: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\n\"y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H - 1}\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nInconsistency?\n\nRead carefully.\n\n\"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n\" such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nAt turn t1 + H - 1, position is 9.\n\nNow, the actions are from t=0 to H-1, meaning a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H - 1}.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action at turn T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nSo at turn t1, position y_{t1} =2.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} is set.\n\nWe need that at turn t1 + H - 1, y_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nThe last action is a_{t1 + H - 1}, which, when applied, results in y_{t1 + H} = y_{t1 + H - 1} + Δy, but we need y_{t1 + H - 1} =9, so at that turn, we are already at 9, and the action might be S or something.\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} =9 means at turn t1 + H - 1, we are at position 9.\n\nThe actions up to a_{t1 + H - 2} set y_{t1 + H - 1}, and a_{t1 + H - 1} is chosen, but since we are already at 9, if we choose U or D, we might go to 10 or 8, which is invalid, but we can choose S to stay.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to reach position 9 at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nFor example, with H=7, we want y_{60 + 7 - 1} = y_{66} =9.\n\ny_{66} =9.\n\nNow, with the direct path:\n\nAt turn 60: y=2\n\nAfter a_{60}, y_{61} set.\n\nIf we do U at turn 60, y_{61}=3\n\nU at 61, y_{62}=4\n\nU at 62, y_{63}=5\n\nU at 63, y_{64}=6\n\nU at 64, y_{65}=7\n\nU at 65, y_{66}=8\n\nThen to have y_{66}=9, we need to be at 8 at turn 65, and then U at turn 65 to go to 9 at turn 66? No.\n\nAt turn 65, position y_{65}, then action a_{65}, sets y_{66}.\n\nIf y_{65}=8, and a_{65}=U, then y_{66}=9.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H - 1} = y_{66} =9 for H=7? t1 + H -1 =60 +7 -1=66.\n\ny_{66}=9.\n\nIn this case, after a_{65}=U, y_{66}=9.\n\nBut at turn 66, position is 9, which is the goal.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from a_{60} to a_{66} for H=7? H-1=6, so t from 0 to 6, a_{60} to a_{66}? t=0 to H-1=6, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 +6} = a_{60} to a_{66}.\n\na_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so for H=7, t=0 to 6, actions a_{60} to a_{66}.\n\nAfter a_{66}, y_{67} is set, but we don't care about y_{67}, since we reach at turn t1 + H -1 =66.\n\ny_{66} is set by action a_{65}, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T:\n\n- Position y_T\n\n- Choose action a_T\n\n- Then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T\n\n- Collision checked based on y_T\n\nFor the state, at turn t1=60, position y_{60}=2.\n\nWe choose actions a_{60}, a_{61}, ..., up to a_{t1 + H - 1}\n\nAfter applying a_{t1 + H - 1}, y_{t1 + H} is set, but we need y_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nTo have y_{t1 + H - 1} =9, that means at turn t1 + H - 1, we are at 9.\n\nThe action at turn t1 + H - 1 could be S, or if we just arrived, but since we are at 9, we can stay.\n\nIn terms of reaching, for H=7, we want y_{66}=9.\n\nIn the direct up path:\n\nAt turn 60: y=2, action U → y_{61}=3\n\nTurn 61: y=3, action U → y_{62}=4\n\nTurn 62: y=4, action U → y_{63}=5\n\nTurn 63: y=5, action U → y_{64}=6\n\nTurn 64: y=6, action U → y_{65}=7\n\nTurn 65: y=7, action U → y_{66}=8\n\nNow at turn 65, y=7, not 9.\n\nThen action U, y_{66}=8.\n\nNot 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 66, we need to be at y=8 or y=9 or y=10 at turn 65, but y=10 invalid, so must be at y=8 or y=9 at turn 65.\n\nIf at turn 65, y=8, then U to y_{66}=9.\n\nOr if y=9, S to stay.\n\nBut in the path above, at turn 65, y=7, so we need one more step.\n\ny0=2, y1=3, y2=4, y3=5, y4=6, y5=7, y6=8, y7=9.\n\nSo at turn t1 + t, y_{60+t}\n\nSet t such that at turn 60+t, position y_t.\n\ny_{60} =2\n\nAfter actions, y_{61} = y_{60} + Δy_{60}, etc.\n\nTo have y_{66} =9, that is at turn 66.\n\nFrom above, with all U:\n\ny_{60}=2\n\ny_{61}=3\n\ny_{62}=4\n\ny_{63}=5\n\ny_{64}=6\n\ny_{65}=7\n\ny_{66}=8  (if a_{65}=U)\n\ny_{67}=9\n\nSo y_{66}=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y_{66}=9, we need to be at 9 at turn 66.\n\nFor example, if we start going up faster, but we can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nMinimum to go from 2 to 9 is 7 steps, so earliest at turn 67, y=9.\n\ny_{60} =2\n\nAfter 0 actions: at turn 60, y=2\n\nAfter 1 action: turn 61, y=3\n\n...\n\nAfter 6 actions: turn 66, y=8? Let's see:\n\nAfter k actions, position at turn 60+k.\n\nAt turn 60, after 0 actions, position y=2.\n\nAfter first action a_{60}, position at turn 61 is y_{61} = y_{60} + Δa_{60}\n\nSimilarly, after m actions, position at turn 60+m.\n\nWe need position at turn t1 + H -1 =60 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nSo after (H-1) actions, position at turn 60 + (H-1) = t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter k actions, position at turn 60+k.\n\nSet turn T = t1 + H -1, position at T should be 9.\n\nT = 60 + H -1\n\nPosition at T is after (T - 60) actions have been applied? At turn T, position y_T is set, and (T - 60) actions have been taken from turn 60 to turn T-1.\n\nNumber of actions from turn 60 to turn T-1 is (T-1) - 60 +1 = T - 60.\n\nActions a_{60} to a_{T-1} affect y_{61} to y_T}.\n\ny_T is determined by actions from a_{60} to a_{T-1}.\n\nFor position at turn T to be 9, it depends on previous actions.\n\nThe minimal T where y_T=9 from y_{60}=2 is T=67, with y_{67}=9, after 7 actions: a_{60} to a_{66}, all U.\n\nThen at turn 67, y=9.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIf H=7, t1 + H -1 =60+7-1=66, so we need y_{66}=9.\n\nBut with direct path, y_{66}=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y_{66}=9, we need to reach earlier, but from y=2, to be at y=9 at turn 66, we must have started from higher or moved faster, impossible since min 7 steps to increase by 7.\n\nFrom turn 60 to turn 66, there are 6 actions: a_{60} to a_{65}, setting y_{61} to y_{66}.\n\ny_{66} is set by a_{65}, based on y_{65}.\n\nTo have y_{66}=9, we need y_{65} + Δa_{65} =9.\n\nSince y_{65} <=8, if y_{65}=8, Δa= +1, or y_{65}=9, Δa=0, or y_{65}=10 invalid.\n\nSo possible if at turn 65, y_{65}=8 and a_{65}=U, or y_{65}=9 and a_{65}=S.\n\nBut from y_{60}=2, to reach y_{65}=8 or 9.\n\ny_{65} at turn 65.\n\nFrom turn 60 to 65, 5 actions: a_{60} to a_{64}, setting y_{61} to y_{65}.\n\ny_{65} is set by a_{64}, based on y_{64}.\n\nMinimal y at turn 65: if all U, y_{65} = 2 + 5 = 7? y_{60}=2, a_{60} U, y_{61}=3; a_{61} U, y_{62}=4; ... a_{64} U, y_{65}=6? Let's index:\n\nTurn 60: y=2\n\nAfter a_{60}: y_{61} = 2 + Δa_{60}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{64}: y_{65} = y_{64} + Δa_{64}\n\nWith all U:\n\ny_{61} =3\n\ny_{62}=4\n\ny_{63}=5\n\ny_{64}=6\n\ny_{65}=7\n\nThen y_{66} = y_{65} + Δa_{65}, if U, y_{66}=8\n\nTo have y_{66}=9, we need y_{65}=8 or 9.\n\nBut with 5 actions from turn 60 to 64, we can be at y_{65} up to 2+5=7, or down to 2-5=-3 but invalid, or less, so maximum y_{65} is 7 with all U.\n\nThus impossible to have y_{66}=9 with fewer than 7 actions? Let's see H.\n\nH is the number of actions.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =60 + H -1\n\nPosition at turn 60 + H -1 should be 9.\n\nThe number of actions to reach that position.\n\nFrom turn 60 to turn 60 + H -1, there are (H-1) actions: a_{60} to a_{60 + H -2}, which set y_{61} to y_{60 + H -1}.\n\ny_{60 + H -1} is determined by actions a_{60} to a_{60 + H -2}.\n\nThe position at turn 60 is y_{60}=2, fixed.\n\nAfter k actions, position at turn 60 + k.\n\nFor position at turn T to be 9, with T = 60 + H -1.\n\nThe minimal T for y_T=9 is 67, with T-60=7, so 7 actions needed, T=67.\n\nThen for y_{67}=9, we have T=67=60 + H -1, so 60 + H -1 =67, thus H-1=7, H=8.\n\n60 + H -1 =67, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nThen y_{67}=9.\n\nWith H=8 actions: a_{60} to a_{67}, but we need actions up to a_{t1 + H -1} = a_{67} for H=8.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} = y_{67} =9.\n\nActions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1} = a_{60} to a_{67} for t=0 to 7.\n\nBut a_{67} is the action at turn 67, which, if we are at y_{67}=9, we can choose S to stay, or if we arrived at 9 from 8 at turn 67, but y_{67} is position at turn 67 before action.\n\nAt turn 67, y_{67}=9, then we choose a_{67}, which sets y_{68}, but since we are done at turn 67, we don't care about y_{68}, so a_{67} can be S, for example.\n\nIn the sequence, for the direct path to reach y=9 at turn 67:\n\nActions: a_{60}=U, y_{61}=3\n\na_{61}=U, y_{62}=4\n\na_{62}=U, y_{63}=5\n\na_{63}=U, y_{64}=6\n\na_{64}=U, y_{65}=7\n\na_{65}=U, y_{66}=8\n\na_{66}=U, y_{67}=9\n\nThen at turn 67, y=9, so we need H such that t1 + H -1 =67, so 60 + H -1 =67, H-1=7, H=8.\n\nActions from t=0 to 7: a_{60} to a_{66}? t=0 to H-1=7, a_{60} to a_{67}? t1 + t for t=0 to 7: 60+0=60 to 60+7=67.\n\na_{60} to a_{67}.\n\nBut a_{67} is at turn 67, when we are at y_{67}=9, so we can set a_{67}=S, but it's not necessary, since we are already at 9 at that turn.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify actions up to a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nFor H=8, a_{60} to a_{67}.\n\nBut in the path above, a_{67} is not used to reach 9, since we reach at turn 67 before action.\n\nTo have y_{67}=9, it is set by a_{66}, so a_{67} is after reaching.\n\nBut the position is at turn 67.\n\nFor collision, at each turn up to turn 67, we need no collision when on freeway.\n\nIn this case, at turn 67, y=9, not freeway, so no collision.\n\nIn the direct path, with all U:\n\nTurn 60: y=2, freeway 2, no collision (as before)\n\nTurn 61: y=3, freeway 3, no collision at t=1 relative\n\nTurn 62: y=4, freeway 4, no collision\n\nTurn 63: y=5, freeway 5, no collision\n\nTurn 64: y=6, freeway 6, no collision at t=4 relative\n\nTurn 65: y=7, freeway 7, no collision at t=5\n\nTurn 66: y=8, freeway 8, no collision at t=6\n\nTurn 67: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nAnd we have H=8 actions: a_{60} to a_{67}, but for the last action, at turn 67, y=9, we can choose a_{67}=S.\n\nIn the sequence, actions are specified for each turn, including the turn when we are at goal.\n\nBut since at turn 67, we are at 9, and no action needed, but we have to specify an action, so S is fine.\n\nSimilarly, in the minimal H, with H=8 for this path.\n\nBut earlier I thought H=7 for the moves, but due to the indexing, H=8 is needed to have position at turn 66 or something.\n\nLet's confirm the requirement.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith t1=60, so for example, if we want y_{66}=9, what is the minimal H.\n\ny_{66}=9, then t1 + H -1 =66, 60 + H -1 =66, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nThen with H=7, we need y_{66}=9.\n\nFrom y_{60}=2, to y_{66}=9 in 6 steps? From turn 60 to 66, the actions a_{60} to a_{65} set y_{61} to y_{66}.\n\nNumber of actions from turn 60 to 65: 6 actions (a_{60} to a_{65}), setting y_{61} to y_{66}.\n\ny_{66} = y_{65} + Δa_{65}\n\nTo have y_{66}=9, we need y_{65} + Δa_{65} =9.\n\ny_{65} is set by previous actions.\n\nWith 5 actions a_{60} to a_{64}, setting y_{61} to y_{65}, max y_{65} is 2+5=7 if all U.\n\nThen y_{66} = y_{65} + Δa_{65} <=7+1=8 <9, or if y_{65}=7, U to 8, D to 6, S to 7, cannot reach 9.\n\nMinimal y_{65} is 0 or higher, but to reach 9, impossible in 6 actions for y_{66}, because from y_{60}=2, after 6 actions, position at turn 66 can be from 2-6=-4 to 2+6=8, so y_{66} <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nThus, impossible to have y_{66}=9.\n\nSimilarly, y_{67} can be 9, with 7 actions a_{60} to a_{66}, setting y_{61} to y_{67}.\n\ny_{67} = y_{66} + Δa_{66}, and with y_{66} up to 8, can be 9.\n\nSo minimal turn to reach y=9 is turn 67, with y_{67}=9.\n\nThen for that, t1 + H -1 =67, 60 + H -1=67, H-1=7, H=8.\n\nThen actions a_{60} to a_{67}, but for a_{67}, it is at turn 67 when y_{67}=9, so we can set it to S.\n\nIn the direct path, with a_{60} to a_{66} all U, and a_{67}=S.\n\nBut in the sequence for the answer, we need to output the actions from turn 60 to turn 60+H-1=67 for H=8.\n\nNow, back to the collision, in the direct path, as I listed earlier for turns 60 to 66, all safe, and turn 67 y=9 safe.\n\nBut at turn 66, y=8, freeway 8, collision at t=9,10,11,12 relative.\n\nt relative to t1=60, so at turn 66, t=66-60=6.\n\nFreeway 8 collision at t=9,10,11,12, t=6 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nBut is there a way with H smaller? H=8 is minimal for reaching turn 67.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier by going down, but that would take more turns or same, so H=8 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if with this path, all is safe.\n\nFreeway 6 at turn 64: y=6, relative t=64-60=4, freeway 6 collision at t=1,2, not 4, safe.\n\nFreeway 7 at turn 65: y=7, t=5, collision at t=9,10,11, not 5, safe.\n\nFreeway 8 at turn 66: y=8, t=6, collision at t=9-12, not 6, safe.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought H=7, but that was a mistake in indexing.\n\nSo for the direct path, H=8, actions: U,U,U,U,U,U,U,S or something, but with 7 U and one S.\n\nIn the sequence: a_{60}=U, a_{61}=U, a_{62}=U, a_{63}=U, a_{64}=U, a_{65}=U, a_{66}=U, then a_{67}=S.\n\nBut after a_{66}=U, y_{67}=9, then at turn 67, y=9, a_{67}=S, y_{68}=9, but we don't care.\n\nSince we reach at turn 67, we can have a_{66} such that we arrive at 9 at turn 67.\n\nIn the actions, for H=8, we have 8 actions, but the last one is at the turn when we are already at 9.\n\nTo minimize H, but H=8 is necessary.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter sequence if we go down and up, but that would take more turns, so not minimal H.\n\nFor example, to reach faster, but we can't, since max +1 per turn.\n\nSo minimal H is 8.\n\nNow, but in the direct path, is there any collision at the times?\n\nFreeway 2 at turn 60: t=0, no collision.\n\nBut freeway 2 has collision at t=3, which is turn 63.\n\nIn the path, at turn 63, we are at y=5, not on freeway 2, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 at turn 61: t=1, no collision.\n\nFreeway 6 at turn 64: t=4, no collision.\n\nAll fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 2 and 3, they have the same cars, but at different y, so separate.\n\nIn this case, the path seems safe.\n\nBut let's make sure about the relative times.\n\nt relative to t1=60.\n\nAt turn 60, t=0\n\nTurn 61, t=1\n\n...\n\nTurn 66, t=6\n\nTurn 67, t=7\n\nFreeway 8 collision at t=9,10,11,12, which are turns 69,70,71,72, not in our path.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo with all U actions, we can reach in H=8.\n\nBut the actions: for H=8, we need to specify a_{60} to a_{67}.\n\nIn the sequence, a_{60}=U, a_{61}=U, a_{62}=U, a_{63}=U, a_{64}=U, a_{65}=U, a_{66}=U, a_{67}=S\n\nBut a_{67}=S is not necessary, but we have to specify an action for that turn.\n\nSince the position is already 9 at turn 67 before action, we can choose S.\n\nTo avoid specifying extra action, but H=8 is fixed.\n\nPerhaps we can have y_{66}=9 with different path, but impossible as above.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 7 and 8, there are collisions at later times, but not in our early path.\n\nBut is there a reason to take a different path? For example, if we stay or something, but that would increase H, not decrease.\n\nPerhaps at some point we need to avoid, but in this case no need.\n\nBut let's check freeway 6 at turn 64: y=6, t=4, safe.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 6 has one car, which we analyzed.\n\nSimilarly, all seem fine.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to output the sequence.\n\nBut the player is at (0,2) initially, and cars are moving, but in this path, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm with the car positions.\n\nFor example, at turn 64, freeway 6, car: (-6,-17,right,6), span at t=4: [ -17 +6*4, -6 +6*4] = [-17+24, -6+24] = [7,18], 0 not in, yes.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 65, freeway 7, cars: first car (-36,-47,right,4), span at t=5: [-47+20, -36+20] = [-27,-16], 0 not in; second car (28,17,right,4) [17+20,28+20]=[37,48], 0 not in.\n\nTurn 66, freeway 8, car (-27,-38,right,3), span at t=6: [-38+18, -27+18] = [-20,-9], 0 not in.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo minimal H is 8, with 7 U and one S at the end, but the S is at turn 67.\n\nSince we reach at turn 67, and we need to include action for that turn, S is fine.\n\nTo have only the actions to reach, but the sequence must have H actions including the turn when we are at goal.\n\nPerhaps we can have a_{66} such that we arrive at 9 at turn 67, and no need for a_{67}, but the action sequence must be from t=0 to H-1 for H turns, with y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nWith H=8, t1+H-1=67, y_{67}=9.\n\nActions a_{60} to a_{67}, with a_{67} being S.\n\nIn the path, a_{60} to a_{66} are U, a_{67} is S.\n\nBut we can set a_{67} to U, but y=10 invalid, not allowed, so must be S or D, but D to 8, then not at 9, so must be S.\n\ny_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so at y=9, U not allowed, similarly D to 8 not at 9.\n\nSo only S is possible if we want to stay at 9.\n\nBut since we are at 9 at turn 67, we can choose S.\n\nNow for the answer, but the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and in this case H=8.\n\nBut is there a way with H=7? Earlier we saw impossible.\n\nPerhaps by starting with down, but that would make it slower.\n\nFor example, if at turn 60, we do S, then y still 2, then we need more steps.\n\nOr D, to y=1, then need to go to 9, even longer.\n\nSo H=8 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=8, we have 8 actions, but the first 7 are U, last is S.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nBut in the output format, it should be like:\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 67: S\n\nBut Turn 67 is t1 + H -1 =67, which is included.\n\nH=8, t from 0 to 7, turns 60 to 67.\n\nNow, but I think I missed something.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 2 and 3, at t=3 relative, collision.\n\nIn our path, at t=3, turn 63, we are at y=5, not on freeway 2 or 3, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 at t=1,2, turn 61 and 62, but at turn 61, we are at y=3, not on 6; turn 62 y=4, not on 6.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 8 with the sequence all U except last S.\n\nBut since we reach at turn 67, and a_{67} is S, it's fine.\n\nTo have only 7 actions, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps the indexing is different.\n\nAnother thought: maybe at turn 60, we are at position, and we take action immediately to move.\n\nBut from the dynamics, position at turn T is y_T, then action a_T.\n\nIn the beginning, at turn 60, y=2, we take a_{60}, go to y_{61}, etc.\n\nTo have y_{66}=9, impossible, as established.\n\nSo I think H=8 is correct.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nPerhaps for this state, with the direct path, it works.\n\nBut in the freeway 7 and 8, collisions at later times, but we pass before that.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: S\n\nWith H=8.\n\nBut at turn 66: action U, to go to y=9 at turn 67.\n\nThen at turn 67, action S.\n\nIn the sequence, Turn 67: S.\n\nBut we can have Turn 66: S if we were at 9, but we are at 8.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier by being at higher y, but not possible.\n\nI think this is minimal.\n\nBut let's check if at some point we need to avoid.\n\nFor example, at turn 63, if we were on freeway 3, but we are not.\n\nAnother thing: the note about moving to different y.\n\nFor example, when we move from y=2 to y=3 at turn 60, action U, then at turn 60, we are on y=2, no collision; at turn 61, on y=3, no collision, etc.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut the player position is (0, y_t), and cars are on the freeway, but we are at x=0, and cars span includes 0 or not.\n\nIn the collision, it says \"0 ∈ Span(T)\" for the car on freeway y_T.\n\nAnd we are at x=0, so if span includes 0, collision.\n\nIn our case, for the times we are on freeways, span does not include 0.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 8, with the sequence above.\n\nBut in the output, it should be for turns from 60 to 67.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 60: U \\\\ Turn 61: U \\\\ Turn 62: U \\\\ Turn 63: U \\\\ Turn 64: U \\\\ Turn 65: U \\\\ Turn 66: U \\\\ Turn 67: S }\n\nWith H=8.\n\nBut is S necessary? We can omit the last action, but the sequence must have H actions, and y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nWith this, at turn 67, y=9, and action S, but the position is already 9 before action.\n\nIf we have only 7 actions: a_{60} to a_{66}, all U, then y_{67}=9, but we need y_{t1+H-1}=y_{66} for H=7? With H=7, t1+H-1=60+7-1=66, y_{66} should be 9, but y_{66}=8, not 9.\n\nSo must have H=8.\n\nThus, this should be it.\n\nPerhaps we can have a different sequence where at turn 66 we are at 9, but impossible.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 60\\) is 8.

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 3) at turn t_1 = 61. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move on specific freeways, and I need to avoid being on a freeway when there's a car covering position x=0 at that turn. The collision rule says: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in the span of some car on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nAlso, when moving to a new freeway, at turn T, if I move, I'm on y_T for that turn, and I won't be on y_{T+1} until the next turn. So for collision, at turn T, I only care about the car on the freeway I'm currently on, y_T.\n\nNow, the car states are given for turn t_1 = 61. For each car, I have head, tail, direction, and speed. Direction \"right\" means it's moving right, so for right-moving cars, span is [tail, head] and it moves to [tail + s*Δt, head + s*Δt]. Similarly, left-moving: span [head, tail] moves to [head - s*Δt, tail - s*Δt].\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway at t_1=61:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, (-48, -95, right, 48). Since it's right-moving, tail is -95, head is -48? The notation says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\", so in this case, h = -48, τ = -95, so span is [-95, -48] at t=61.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\", so head is first.\n\nFor freeway 1: car: h = -48, τ = -95, d = right, s = 48. Since right, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-95, -48].\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] = [-95 + 48*(T-61), -48 + 48*(T-61)]\n\nCollision if 0 is in this span at turn T when I'm on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars: (24, 13, right, 12) and (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: h=24, τ=13, d=right, s=12. But for right, span should be [τ, h] = [13, 24]? τ is tail, so if τ=13, h=24, and right, so span [13,24] at t1.\n\nBut typically for right-moving, tail should be less than head, but here τ=13, h=24, so 13 to 24, that's fine, moving right.\n\nSecond car: h=-24, τ=-35, d=right, s=12, span [τ,h] = [-35, -24] at t1.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? It says (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12), identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: (48,83,left,36). Left-moving, so span [h,τ] = [48,83] at t1? h=48, τ=83, and since left, span [h,τ] = [48,83].\n\nThen at T, span [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] = [48 - 36*(T-61), 83 - 36*(T-61)]\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4? (48,83,left,36)\n\nFreeway 6: (0,-11,right,6). h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=6. Span [τ,h] = [-11,0] at t1? Since τ=-11, h=0.\n\nAt t1, span is [-11,0], and since it's at x=0 at t1, if I'm on freeway 6 at turn 61, I would collide? But I'm starting at y=3, so not on freeway 6 yet.\n\nThe player is at (0,3) at turn t1, so on freeway 3? y=3.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8, so at turn t1, y=3, so I need to check cars on freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 has two cars: (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFirst car: span [13,24] at t1, which is from x=13 to x=24, so x=0 not covered.\n\nSecond car: span [-35,-24], x=0 not covered. So at t=61, on freeway 3, no collision.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 to y=9, moving through freeways 4,5,6,7,8, and avoid collisions when on those freeways at the specific turns.\n\nSince I need minimal turns, I should move up as much as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nThe minimal H would be if I can go up every turn, from y=3 to y=9, that's 6 steps, so H=6 turns, ending at turn t1+5? Let's see.\n\nStart at turn t1, position y_t1 =3.\n\nAfter one turn, t1+1, y could be 4 if U, etc.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t1 + (H-1), y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nIf I do U every turn, from y=3, after 0 turns: y=3 (turn t1)\n\nAfter 1 turn: y=4 (turn t1+1)\n\nAfter 2: y=5 (t1+2)\n\nAfter 3: y=6 (t1+3)\n\nAfter 4: y=7 (t1+4)\n\nAfter 5: y=8 (t1+5)\n\nAfter 6: y=9 (t1+6)\n\nSo to reach y=9 at turn t1+6, I need 6 actions from t1 to t1+5, so H=6.\n\nBut I might have to wait or go down sometimes to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's see if I can go directly up in 6 turns.\n\nI need to check for each freeway I will be on, at the turn I am on it, whether x=0 is covered by a car.\n\nSince I move one y per turn if I go up, I will be on y=3 at t=61, y=4 at t=62, y=5 at t=63, y=6 at t=64, y=7 at t=65, y=8 at t=66, and then at t=67 I would be on y=9, but y=9 is the goal, and there is no freeway y=9, I think freeways are only 1-8, so when I reach y=9, I'm not on any freeway, so no collision possible. The collision is only with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nSo for y=9, no issue.\n\nIn the sequence above, I am on freeways from y=3 to y=8 at turns t=61 to t=66.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At t=61: y=3\n\n- t=62: y=4\n\n- t=63: y=5\n\n- t=64: y=6\n\n- t=65: y=7\n\n- t=66: y=8\n\n- t=67: y=9, done.\n\nNow, I need to ensure that at each of these turns, for the freeway I'm on, x=0 is not covered by any car on that freeway at that time.\n\nLet's check for each freeway at the relevant times.\n\nFirst, define Δt = T - t1, where t1=61.\n\nSo for turn T, Δt = T - 61.\n\nNow, for freeway 3 (y=3) at t=61 (Δt=0):\n\nCars: (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFirst car: span at Δt=0: [13,24], 0 not in [13,24]\n\nSecond car: span [-35,-24], 0 not in [-35,-24]\n\nSo safe at t=61 on y=3.\n\nNow, at t=62 (Δt=1), I will be on y=4.\n\nFreeway 4: cars at t1: (48,83,left,36)\n\nSince left-moving, span at Δt=0: [h,τ] = [48,83]\n\nAt time T, span: [h - s*Δt, τ - s*Δt] = [48 - 36*Δt, 83 - 36*Δt]\n\nFor t=62, Δt=1, span [48-36, 83-36] = [12,47]\n\n0 not in [12,47], so safe.\n\nAt t=63 (Δt=2), on y=5.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4? Cars: (48,83,left,36)\n\nSpan at Δt: [48-36*Δt, 83-36*Δt]\n\nΔt=2, [48-72, 83-72] = [-24,11]\n\nNow, 0 is in [-24,11]? -24 to 11 includes 0, since -24 <= 0 <=11.\n\nYes, 0 is in the span, so if I am on freeway 5 at t=63, I collide.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt t=63, if I go to y=5, and freeway 5 has a car covering x=0 at that time.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=5 at t=63 if I go straight up.\n\nBut t=63 is when I arrive at y=5 if I go up at t=62.\n\nAt turn t=62, I am on y=4, and I choose action at t=62 to go to y=5 at t=63.\n\nAt t=63, I am on y=5, and the car on freeway 5 covers x=0.\n\nSo collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot go directly to y=5 at t=63.\n\nI need to either delay going to y=5 or go down or something.\n\nBut I need minimal turns, so perhaps I can stay or go down for one turn to avoid that time.\n\nSince the car moves, at other times it might not cover x=0.\n\nFor freeway 5, car span at Δt: [48-36*Δt, 83-36*Δt]\n\n0 is in span when 48-36*Δt <= 0 <= 83-36*Δt\n\nSince 48-36*Δt <=0 and 0<=83-36*Δt\n\nFirst inequality: 48-36*Δt <=0 => 36*Δt >=48 => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so Δt >= 2 since integer.\n\nΔt integer, Δt >= 2.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 83-36*Δt => 36*Δt <=83 => Δt <= 83/36 ≈2.305, so Δt <=2.\n\nThus, 0 in span when Δt=2.\n\nFor Δt=1: [48-36,83-36]=[12,47], 0 not in\n\nΔt=2: [48-72,83-72]=[-24,11], 0 in\n\nΔt=3: [48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25], 0 not in\n\nSo only at Δt=2, which is t=61+2=63, the car covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 4, at Δt=1, t=62, span [12,47], no 0.\n\nBut freeway 4 is at t=62, which is fine.\n\nNow, freeway 5 is the issue at t=63.\n\nI need to not be on y=5 at t=63.\n\nI could be on y=5 at a different time.\n\nFor example, if I delay going to y=5.\n\nCurrently, with direct path, I am on y=5 at t=63.\n\nBut if I stay at y=4 for an extra turn or something.\n\nLet's list the times when each freeway has x=0 covered.\n\nI need for each freeway from y=3 to y=8, when x=0 is occupied.\n\nStart with freeway 3 (y=3): cars (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFirst car: span [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] = [13 +12*Δt, 24+12*Δt] since right, τ=13, h=24.\n\nAt Δt, span [13+12Δt, 24+12Δt]\n\n0 in span if 13+12Δt <=0 <=24+12Δt\n\nBut 13+12Δt >0 for all Δt since min at Δt=0 is 13>0, so 0 not <= lower bound, thus never covered? Lower bound is 13+12Δt >=13>0, so x=0 is always left of the span, not covered.\n\nSimilarly, second car: span [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] = [-35 +12*Δt, -24 +12*Δt]\n\n0 in span if -35+12Δt <=0 <= -24+12Δt\n\nFirst, -35+12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <=35 => Δt <= 35/12 ≈2.916, so Δt <=2\n\nSecond, 0 <= -24+12Δt => 12Δt >=24 => Δt >=2\n\nThus at Δt=2, both inequalities: -35+24 = -11 <=0 <= -24+24=0? 0 <=0 true, and -11<=0 true, so 0 in [-11,0]? At Δt=2, span [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], so 0 is included, since tail or head, but span includes endpoints I assume.\n\nThe span is [head, tail] or [tail, head], so includes the positions.\n\nIn this case, at Δt=2, span [-11,0], so x=0 is covered.\n\nFor other Δt, not.\n\nΔt=2: t=61+2=63\n\nSo on freeway 3, at t=63, if I am there, collision from the second car.\n\nBut at t=61, Δt=0, no issue.\n\nNow for freeway 4 (y=4): car (48,83,left,36)\n\nSpan at Δt: [48-36Δt, 83-36Δt] as before.\n\n0 in span when? 48-36Δt <=0 <=83-36Δt\n\n48-36Δt <=0 => Δt >= 48/36=4/3≈1.333, so Δt>=2\n\n0 <=83-36Δt => Δt <=83/36≈2.305, so Δt<=2\n\nThus only at Δt=2, t=63.\n\nBut at t=63, if on y=4, but y=4 is freeway 4, at t=63, Δt=2, span [48-72,83-72]=[-24,11], 0 in it.\n\nBut in our path, we are on y=4 at t=62, Δt=1, span [12,47], no 0.\n\nAt t=63, if on y=4, it would be bad, but in direct path we move to y=5 at t=63.\n\nNow freeway 5 (y=5): same car, (48,83,left,36), so same as freeway 4, at Δt=2, t=63, covered.\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): cars given as (0,-11,right,6)\n\nAt t1, h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=6.\n\nSpan [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] = [-11 +6*Δt, 0 +6*Δt] = [-11+6Δt, 6Δt]\n\n0 in span when -11+6Δt <=0 <=6Δt\n\nFirst: -11+6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=11 => Δt <=11/6≈1.833, so Δt<=1\n\nSecond: 0 <=6Δt always true for Δt>=0\n\nSo only when -11+6Δt <=0, which for Δt=0: -11<=0 true, but 0<=0 true, at Δt=0, span [-11,0], so 0 included.\n\nΔt=1: span [-11+6,0+6]=[-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nΔt=2: span [-11+12,12]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo at Δt=0 and Δt=1, t=61 and t=62, 0 covered.\n\nt=61: Δt=0, span [-11,0], 0 covered.\n\nt=62: Δt=1, span [-5,6], 0 covered.\n\nt=63: Δt=2, span [1,12], 0 not covered.\n\nSo on freeway 6, x=0 covered at t=61 and t=62, not at t=63 or later.\n\nIn direct path, we are on y=6 at t=64 (since t=61 y3, t62 y4, t63 y5, t64 y6)\n\nt=64, Δt=3? t1=61, T=64, Δt=3.\n\nAt Δt=3, span [-11+18,18]=[7,18], 0 not in, so safe at t=64 on y=6.\n\nBut we have issue at t=63 on y=5.\n\nNow freeway 7 (y=7): cars (-32,-43,right,4) and (32,21,right,4)\n\nFirst car: h=-32? \"(-32, -43, right, 4)\"\n\nh=-32, τ=-43, d=right, s=4.\n\nSpan [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] = [-43 +4*Δt, -32 +4*Δt]\n\n0 in span if -43+4Δt <=0 <= -32+4Δt\n\nFirst: -43+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=43 => Δt <=43/4=10.75, so Δt<=10\n\nSecond: 0 <= -32+4Δt => 4Δt >=32 => Δt >=8\n\nSo for Δt from 8 to 10 inclusive.\n\nΔt=8: -43+32 = -11 <=0 <= -32+32=0, so 0 in [-11,0]\n\nΔt=9: -43+36= -7 <=0 <= -32+36=4, 0 in [-7,4]\n\nΔt=10: -43+40= -3 <=0 <= -32+40=8, 0 in [-3,8]\n\nΔt=11: -43+44=1 <=0? 1>0, not <= lower bound, and 0 not in [1,12]? span [-43+44, -32+44]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, lower Δt.\n\nNow second car on y=7: (32,21,right,4) h=32, τ=21, span [21 +4Δt, 32+4Δt], both positive for Δt>=0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSo only the first car matters, and it covers x=0 at Δt=8,9,10, t=69,70,71.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=7 at t=65, Δt=4 (T-61=4), which is not 8,9,10, so not covered. Safe.\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): car (-24,-35,right,3) h=-24, τ=-35, d=right, s=3.\n\nSpan [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] = [-35 +3*Δt, -24 +3*Δt]\n\n0 in span if -35+3Δt <=0 <= -24+3Δt\n\nFirst: -35+3Δt <=0 => 3Δt <=35 => Δt <=35/3≈11.666, Δt<=11\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24+3Δt => 3Δt >=24 => Δt >=8\n\nSo Δt from 8 to 11 inclusive.\n\nΔt=8: -35+24= -11 <=0 <= -24+24=0, 0 in\n\nΔt=9: -35+27= -8 <=0 <= -24+27=3, 0 in\n\nΔt=10: -35+30= -5 <=0 <= -24+30=6, 0 in\n\nΔt=11: -35+33= -2 <=0 <= -24+33=9, 0 in\n\nΔt=12: -35+36=1 >0, not covered.\n\nIn our path, on y=8 at t=66, Δt=5 (66-61=5), which is less than 8, so not covered. Safe.\n\nNow, back to the problem: in direct up path, at t=63, on y=5, collision.\n\nSimilarly, on y=3 at t=63 would have collision, but we are not there.\n\nSo need to avoid being on y=5 at t=63 or on y=3 at t=63, but since we are moving up, we might be elsewhere.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Stay at y=4 for an extra turn, so arrive at y=5 later.\n\n- Or go down to y=2 or something, but that might take more turns.\n\nSince minimal turns, staying or small detour.\n\nAlso, for y=6, it was safe at t=64.\n\nBut let's see the times when y=5 is safe.\n\nFreeway 5: car (48,83,left,36), span [48-36Δt, 83-36Δt]\n\n0 covered only at Δt=2, as above.\n\nSo for y=5, safe except at Δt=2, i.e., t=63.\n\nSo I can be on y=5 at other times, like t=62 or t=64.\n\nSimilarly, for y=3, safe except at t=63 (Δt=2).\n\nNow, at start, t=61, y=3 safe.\n\nIf I go up to y=4 at t=62, safe as we saw.\n\nThen at t=62, on y=4, I need to choose action for t=63.\n\nIf I go up to y=5 at t=63, collision.\n\nSo I can stay at y=4 or go down to y=3.\n\nIf I stay at y=4 at t=63.\n\nAt t=63, if I am on y=4, what happens?\n\nFreeway 4 at t=63, Δt=2, span [48-72,83-72]=[-24,11], 0 covered, so collision on y=4 at t=63.\n\nOh, so both y=4 and y=5 are unsafe at t=63.\n\nFreeway 4 at Δt=2, t=63, covered.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 covered at t=63.\n\nWhat about y=6? At t=63, if I could be there, but from y=4, I can go to y=5 or stay or down, not directly to y=6.\n\ny changes by at most 1 per turn.\n\nSo at t=63, from y=4, I can be on y=3,4, or5.\n\ny=3 at t=63: freeway 3 at Δt=2, covered, as we saw earlier.\n\ny=4 at t=63: covered.\n\ny=5 at t=63: covered.\n\nSo all options at t=63 for y=3,4,5 are covered? That can't be right for the game, probably I need to avoid that time.\n\nPerhaps I should not be on these freeways at t=63.\n\nBut I have to pass through them.\n\nMaybe go down earlier or something.\n\nSince y=6 is safe at t=63? Freeway 6 at t=63, Δt=2, span for car: at Δt=2, [-11+12,12]=[1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nBut from y=4, I can't reach y=6 in one turn.\n\nAt t=62, I am on y=4.\n\nI need to choose action for t=62, which affects position at t=63.\n\nPosition at t=63 depends on action at t=62.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nLet me denote the turn and position.\n\nTurn t=61: position y=3, must choose action a_{61} for next.\n\nAfter action, position at t=62.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from t=61 to some turn.\n\nSince minimal H, I should aim for small H, like 6 or 7.\n\nH=6 might not be possible due to t=63 issue.\n\nWith H=6, I need to be at y=9 at turn t=61 + (H-1) = t=61 +5 =66 if H=6, since actions from t=61 to t=65, position at t=66 is after 5 actions? Let's clarify.\n\nDefine: at turn t, before action, position is y_t.\n\nThen after action a_t, position y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAnd collision checked at turn t based on y_t and cars at t.\n\nIn the game dynamics: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAlso, \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_{T} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", which is consistent.\n\nSo at each turn T, we have y_T, and we check collision on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nFor the sequence, we start at t=61, y=3, no collision.\n\nThen we choose a_{61}, which determines y_{62}.\n\nThen at t=62, we have y_{62}, check collision, and so on.\n\nIn the direct up: a_{61}=U, y_{62}=4\n\nAt t=62, y=4, freeway 4, Δt=1, span [12,47] for the car, 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen a_{62}=U, y_{63}=5\n\nAt t=63, y=5, freeway 5, Δt=2, span [-24,11], 0 in, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nTo avoid, at t=62, instead of U, I could do S or D.\n\nIf a_{62}=S, then y_{63}=4 (since stay)\n\nAt t=63, y=4, freeway 4, Δt=2, span [-24,11], 0 in, collision.\n\nIf a_{62}=D, then y_{63}=3 (down from 4 to 3)\n\nAt t=63, y=3, freeway 3, Δt=2, for the second car, span [-11,0], 0 in, collision.\n\nSo all three choices at t=62 lead to collision at t=63 if I take action that puts me on y=3,4, or5 at t=63.\n\nBut y=3,4,5 are all unsafe at t=63.\n\ny=6 is safe at t=63, but I can't reach it from y=4 in one turn.\n\nSo I need to be at a different position earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=62, I am at y=4, but I can't go to y=6.\n\nPerhaps at t=61, instead of going up, I stay or go down.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nLet's list safe times for each freeway.\n\nFor freeway y=3: unsafe at t=63 (Δt=2), safe otherwise? At Δt=2 only.\n\nAt Δt=0, t=61, safe as we were.\n\nFreeway y=4: unsafe at t=63 (Δt=2), safe otherwise.\n\nSimilarly y=5: unsafe only at t=63.\n\ny=6: unsafe at t=61 and t=62 (Δt=0 and 1), safe at t=63 and later.\n\ny=7: unsafe at t=69,70,71 (Δt=8,9,10), safe otherwise for our range.\n\ny=8: unsafe at t=69,70,71,72 (Δt=8 to 11), but since we are going to y=9, we might not be there at those times.\n\nIn minimal path, we should be on y=8 around t=66.\n\nNow, to go from y=3 to y=9, I need to pass through y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut at t=63, y=4,5,6 are problematic: y=4 and 5 unsafe, y=6 is safe at t=63 but I can't be there if I'm at y=4 at t=62.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=6 at t=63.\n\nHow? From t=61, if I go up twice, but to y=5 at t=63? Not directly.\n\nAt t=61, y=3, I choose a_{61}.\n\nIf a_{61}=U, y_{62}=4\n\nThen at t=62, if I could go to y=6, but I can only change by 1, so y_{63} can be 3,4,5.\n\nIf a_{61}=S, y_{62}=3, then at t=62, y=3, which is safe? At t=62, Δt=1 for freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 at Δt=1: cars.\n\nFirst car: span [13+12*1, 24+12*1]=[25,36], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: span [-35+12*1, -24+12*1]=[-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo at t=62, on y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=62, I can choose action.\n\nSimilarly, if a_{61}=D, y_{62}=2, but y=2 is not a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, y=2 should be freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2: cars (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAt t=62, Δt=1.\n\nFirst car: span [13+12,24+12]=[25,36], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: span [-35+12,-24+12]=[-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut going down might add turns.\n\nSince the problem is at t=63, I need to be on a safe freeway at that turn.\n\nPossible safe freeways at t=63: y=6,7,8.\n\ny=6 at t=63: freeway 6, Δt=2, span [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\ny=7 at t=63: freeway 7, Δt=2, for first car span [-43+8, -32+8]=[-35,-24], 0 not in; second car [21+8,32+8]=[29,40], 0 not in; safe.\n\ny=8 at t=63: freeway 8, Δt=2, span [-35+6, -24+6]=[-29,-18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAlso, y=0 or y=9, but y=0 might be safe, but we start from y=3.\n\nBut at t=63, if I can be on y=6,7, or8, it is safe.\n\nHow to be on y=6 at t=63, for example.\n\nFrom t=61, y=3.\n\nTo be at y=6 at t=63, I need to increase y by 3 in 2 turns, but I can only change by 1 per turn, so impossible. Max change is 2 in 2 turns, to y=5.\n\nSimilarly, to y=7 or8 even farther.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=6 or above at t=63 from y=3 at t=61.\n\nThe only possibilities at t=63 are y=1,2,3,4,5.\n\nBut y=1,2,3,4,5 all have freeways.\n\nFreeway y=1: car (-48,-95,right,48)\n\nAt t=63, Δt=2, span [ -95 +48*2, -48 +48*2] = [-95+96, -48+96] = [1,48], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway y=2: cars same as y=3, but let's check.\n\nFreeway 2: cars (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAt t=63, Δt=2, first car [13+24,24+24]=[37,48], 0 not in\n\nSecond car [-35+24,-24+24]=[-11,0], 0 in, so unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at t=63 unsafe, as before.\n\ny=4 unsafe, y=5 unsafe.\n\nBut y=1 at t=63: safe, as above.\n\ny=2 at t=63: unsafe, because of second car.\n\nFreeway 2 at Δt=2: second car span [-11,0], 0 covered.\n\nSo only y=1 is safe at t=63 among low y.\n\nBut I am at y=3 at t=61, to be at y=1 at t=63, I need to go down twice.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up to y=9, which will take more turns.\n\nBut let's see if I can do it with minimal extra turns.\n\nFirst, to avoid t=63 collision, I can be on y=1 at t=63.\n\nSo from t=61, y=3, I can go down to y=2 at t=62, then down to y=1 at t=63.\n\nAt t=62, on y=2: freeway 2, Δt=1, as before, safe.\n\nAt t=63, on y=1: freeway 1, Δt=2, span [1,48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut that will take many turns, from y=1 to y=9, 8 steps, so at least 8 turns from t=63, so H large.\n\nNot minimal.\n\nI could stay at a safe position.\n\nFor example, at t=62, I can be on y=3 or y=4 or y=2, all safe at t=62.\n\ny=2 at t=62: freeway 2, Δt=1, safe as before.\n\ny=3 at t=62: freeway 3, Δt=1, safe.\n\ny=4 at t=62: freeway 4, Δt=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=63, I need to be on a safe freeway.\n\nBut as above, only y=1 is safe at t=63, or perhaps y=6,7,8 but I can't reach.\n\ny=0 or y=9, but y=0 is below, freeway? y=0 is not a freeway, I think freeways start from y=1.\n\nThe grid has y=0 to 9, but freeways on y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nSo at t=63, if I can be on y=0 or y=9, safe.\n\ny=9 is goal, but from y=3 at t=61, to y=9 at t=63, impossible, need 6 steps.\n\ny=0: from y=3, go down to y=0 at t=64? Let's see.\n\nAt t=61, y=3.\n\nIf I go down, a_{61}=D, y_{62}=2\n\nAt t=62, y=2, safe.\n\nThen a_{62}=D, y_{63}=1\n\nAt t=63, y=1, safe as above.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up.\n\nBut to reach y=9, from y=1 at t=63, I need to go up 8 times, so at t=71, y=9, H=11 turns? Let's calculate.\n\nTurn t=61: start y=3\n\na61=D, y62=2\n\na62=D, y63=1  (safe at t=63)\n\nThen a63=U, y64=2\n\na64=U, y65=3\n\na65=U, y66=4\n\na66=U, y67=5\n\na67=U, y68=6\n\na68=U, y69=7\n\na69=U, y70=8\n\na70=U, y71=9\n\nSo at t=71, y=9, so H=11 actions from t=61 to t=70, position at t=71.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, from t=61 to t=61+H-1, y at t=61+H-1=9.\n\nt=71, so 71 = 61 + H -1, so 71-61+1=11, H=11.\n\nBut this is not minimal, since with waiting I can do better.\n\nAt t=62, I am at y=4 (if I went up first), or at y=3 or y=2.\n\nSuppose at t=62, I am at y=3, for example.\n\nThen at t=62, y=3, safe.\n\nI can choose to stay or go up or down.\n\nIf I stay, a62=S, y63=3, but at t=63, y=3 unsafe.\n\nIf I go up, y63=4, unsafe.\n\nIf I go down, y63=2, freeway 2 at t=63, unsafe as span has 0.\n\nSo no good.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=62, I am at y=4, same problem.\n\nIf at t=62, I am at y=2, then at t=63, I can go to y=1,2, or3.\n\ny=1 safe, y=2 unsafe, y=3 unsafe.\n\nSo only y=1 safe at t=63.\n\nBut then I have to go up from there.\n\nTo save turns, I can go to y=6 at a safe time.\n\nFor example, y=6 is safe for t>=63.\n\nAt t=63, y=6 safe.\n\nBut how to be at y=6 at t=63? From t=61 y=3, impossible in 2 turns.\n\nEarliest I can be at y=6 is t=64, with three up moves: t=61 y3, a61=U, y62=4; a62=U, y63=5; but at t=63 y=5 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I delay.\n\nSuppose at t=61, I do S, a61=S, y62=3\n\nAt t=62, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=62, I can do U, a62=U, y63=4, but at t=63 y=4 unsafe.\n\nOr S, y63=3, unsafe.\n\nD, y63=2, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nAt t=61, I do D, a61=D, y62=2\n\nAt t=62, y=2, safe.\n\nThen a62=U, y63=3, but at t=63 y=3 unsafe.\n\na62=S, y63=2, unsafe.\n\na62=D, y63=1, safe.\n\nThen from y=1 at t=63, go up.\n\nBut slow.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=4 at t=62, then instead of moving at t=62, I stay or something, but at t=63 I have to move, but all positions unsafe.\n\nUnless I can skip the turn or something, but I can't.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=63, only low or high y are safe, but high not reachable, low is y=1, so I have to go down to y=1 at t=63, then go up.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach y=6 at t=64 safely.\n\nTo be at y=6 at t=64, I need to be at y=5 at t=63 or y=7 at t=63, impossible, or from y=5 at t=63 with U action.\n\nBut at t=63, y=5 is unsafe, so I collide before I can move.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on position y_T, so if y_T is on a freeway with car at 0, collision occurs, and I think the game ends or I can't proceed, so I need to avoid that.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=5 at t=63.\n\nSimilarly, I need to arrive at y=5 at a different time.\n\nFor example, at t=64, y=5 might be safe.\n\nFreeway 5 at t=64, Δt=3, span [48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=62, Δt=1, [12,47], safe.\n\nBut at t=62, if I am on y=5, but how? From y=3 at t=61, I can go to y=4 at t=62, not directly to y=5.\n\nAt t=62, I can be on y=4, not y=5.\n\nSo I can be on y=5 at t=63 or later.\n\nt=63 unsafe, t=64 safe.\n\nSo I need to be on y=5 at t=64, for example.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nLet's plan a path that avoids t=63 for y=3,4,5.\n\nFor example, at t=61, y=3, I can go down to y=2.\n\na61=D, y62=2\n\nAt t=62, y=2, freeway 2, Δt=1, safe as before.\n\nThen at t=62, I need to choose action for t=63.\n\nAt t=63, I want to be safe, so I can go down to y=1, a62=D, y63=1\n\nAt t=63, y=1, safe.\n\nThen from t=63, y=1, I can start going up.\n\nBut y=1 to y=9, 8 steps, so from t=63 to t=71, y=9 at t=71.\n\nBut I can go faster.\n\nSince y=6 is safe from t=63 onward, I can go directly to y=6 as soon as possible after t=62.\n\nFor example, at t=62, if I am at y=2, I can go up to y=3 at t=63, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt t=62, I am at y=2, I go down to y=1 at t=63, safe.\n\nThen at t=63, y=1, I go up to y=2 at t=64.\n\nAt t=64, y=2, freeway 2, Δt=3.\n\nFreeway 2 at Δt=3: first car [13+36,24+36]=[49,60], 0 not in; second car [-35+36,-24+36]=[1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen a63=U, y64=2\n\nThen a64=U, y65=3\n\nAt t=65, y=3, freeway 3, Δt=4 (t=65-61=4)\n\nSpan first car [13+48,24+48]=[61,72], 0 not in; second car [-35+48,-24+48]=[13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen a65=U, y66=4\n\nt=66, y=4, freeway 4, Δt=5, span [48-180,83-180]=[-132,-97], 0 not in, safe.\n\na66=U, y67=5\n\nt=67, y=5, freeway 5, Δt=6, span [48-216,83-216]=[-168,-133], 0 not in, safe.\n\na67=U, y68=6\n\nt=68, y=6, freeway 6, Δt=7, span [-11+42,42]=[31,42], 0 not in, safe.\n\na68=U, y69=7\n\nt=69, y=7, freeway 7, Δt=8, which is unsafe time for y=7.\n\nAt Δt=8, for first car span [-43+32, -32+32]=[-11,0], 0 in, so collision.\n\nOh, problem at t=69 on y=7.\n\nWe forgot about the other unsafe times.\n\nIn this path, at t=69, on y=7, it is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, in the direct path, we were on y=7 at t=65, which was safe, but now we are later.\n\nSo we need to consider the whole path.\n\nLet's list the unsafe times for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: only at some times? But we may not use it, but for completeness.\n\nCar: span at Δt: [-95+48Δt, -48+48Δt]\n\n0 in if -95+48Δt <=0 <= -48+48Δt\n\n-95+48Δt <=0 => 48Δt <=95 => Δt <=95/48≈1.979, so Δt<=1\n\n0 <= -48+48Δt => Δt >=1\n\nSo at Δt=1, t=62, span [-95+48, -48+48]=[-47,0], 0 in.\n\nOther times not.\n\nBut we are not on y=1 much.\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at Δt=2, t=63, as above.\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe at Δt=2, t=63.\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe at Δt=2, t=63.\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at Δt=2, t=63.\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe at Δt=0 and 1, t=61 and t=62.\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at Δt=8,9,10, t=69,70,71.\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at Δt=8,9,10,11, t=69,70,71,72.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=3, minimal turns is 6, but not possible due to t=63.\n\nNext, H=7 turns: actions from t=61 to t=67, position at t=68 y=9.\n\nt=61+H-1=9, so t=61+H-1=9, H-1=8-61? t=61 + (H-1) =9 position.\n\ny=9 at turn T=61 + (H-1)\n\nFor H=7, T=61+6=67, y at t=67.\n\nActions from t=61 to t=66.\n\nSimilarly, H=8, T=61+7=68, etc.\n\nWith H=7, I can be at y=9 at t=67.\n\nFrom y=3, I need net +6 in 6 turns, so I can have some stay or down, but net up.\n\nFor example, I can stay at some point to avoid the bad time.\n\nSuppose I stay at y=3 for one extra turn.\n\nAt t=61, a61=S, y62=3\n\nAt t=62, y=3, safe (Δt=1)\n\nThen a62=U, y63=4, but at t=63 y=4 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\na62=S, y63=3, unsafe at t=63.\n\na62=D, y63=2, unsafe at t=63.\n\nNo.\n\nGo down to y=2 at t=62.\n\na61=D, y62=2\n\nAt t=62, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=62, a62=S, y63=2, but at t=63 y=2 unsafe.\n\na62=U, y63=3, unsafe.\n\na62=D, y63=1, safe.\n\nThen from y=1 at t=63, go up.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=67, from t=63 y=1, I need to go to y=9 in 4 turns, impossible, min 8 steps from y=1.\n\ny=1 to y=9 is 8 steps, so from t=63 to t=71, as before.\n\nFor H=7, I need y at t=67 to be 9.\n\nFrom t=63 y=1, at t=67 y=1+4=5 if all up, not 9.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nWith H=7, I can be at y=9 at t=67, so I need to be at y=3 at t=61, then in 6 actions, reach y=9 at t=67.\n\nNet change +6, so I must go up every turn, no stay or down, because each down or stay costs a turn.\n\nIf I go up every turn, y at t=67: from t=61 y=3, a61 U y62=4, a62 U y63=5, a63 U y64=6, a64 U y65=7, a65 U y66=8, a66 U y67=9.\n\nBut at t=63, y=5 collision.\n\nSame issue.\n\nIf I do one stay, for example, at some point, then at t=67 y=8 or something, not 9.\n\nFor example, a61 S, y62=3, then a62 U y63=4, a63 U y64=5, a64 U y65=6, a65 U y66=7, a66 U y67=8, not 9.\n\nThen I need another turn to go to 9.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down once, worse.\n\nSo with H=7, I can only reach y=9 if I go up all 6 turns, but then t=63 collision.\n\nSo H=7 not possible.\n\nH=8: actions from t=61 to t=68, position at t=69 y=9.\n\nThen I can have one extra action, like one stay or one down and up.\n\nBut let's see if I can avoid the collision.\n\nFor example, at t=61, a61 U, y62=4\n\nThen at t=62, instead of U, I do S or D.\n\nIf a62 S, y63=4, but at t=63 y=4 unsafe.\n\nIf a62 D, y63=3, unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\na61 S, y62=3\n\na62 U, y63=4, unsafe.\n\na62 S, y63=3, unsafe.\n\na62 D, y63=2, unsafe.\n\na61 D, y62=2\n\na62 U, y63=3, unsafe.\n\na62 D, y63=1, safe.\n\nThen from t=63 y=1, a63 U y64=2, a64 U y65=3, a65 U y66=4, a66 U y67=5, a67 U y68=6, a68 U y69=9? y69=7 after a68 U from y68=6, let's list.\n\nt=63: y=1\n\na63=U, y64=2\n\nt=64: y=2, freeway 2, Δt=3, safe as before.\n\na64=U, y65=3\n\nt=65: y=3, Δt=4, safe.\n\na65=U, y66=4\n\nt=66: y=4, Δt=5, span freeway 4 [48-180,83-180]=[-132,-97], 0 not in, safe.\n\na66=U, y67=5\n\nt=67: y=5, Δt=6, span [48-216,83-216]=[-168,-133], 0 not in, safe.\n\na67=U, y68=6\n\nt=68: y=6, Δt=7, span freeway 6 [-11+42,42]=[31,42], 0 not in, safe.\n\na68=U, y69=7\n\nt=69: y=7, Δt=8, freeway 7, unsafe as span has 0.\n\nCollision.\n\nAt t=69 on y=7, it is unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, I need to not be on y=7 at t=69.\n\nSimilarly, at t=68, I am on y=6, I can stay or go down or up.\n\nIf I go up to y=7 at t=69, collision.\n\nIf I stay, a68=S, y69=6, then at t=69, y=6, safe.\n\nThen a69=U, y70=7\n\nt=70: y=7, Δt=9, freeway 7, unsafe at Δt=9.\n\nSpan for first car [-43+36, -32+36]=[-7,4], 0 in.\n\nUnsafe.\n\nIf at t=68, I go down to y=5, a68=D, y69=5, then at t=69, y=5, freeway 5, Δt=8, span [48-288,83-288]=[-240,-205], 0 not in, safe.\n\nBut then I am at y=5 at t=69, and I need to go to y=9, so more turns.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nPerhaps from the beginning, go faster to higher y where it is safe.\n\nFor example, go to y=6 at t=64.\n\nTo be at y=6 at t=64, I need to be at y=5 at t=63 or y=6 at t=63 with stay, but y=5 at t=63 unsafe.\n\nSo I can be at y=6 at t=64 by being at y=6 at t=63 with S, but at t=63 y=6 safe, but how to be at y=6 at t=63 from y=3 at t=61.\n\nImpossible.\n\nEarliest to be at y=6 is t=64 with three up moves, but t=63 on y=5 unsafe.\n\nSo I must avoid being on y=5 at t=63.\n\nTherefore, I need to be on y=5 at a different time, like t=64.\n\nSo from t=61, I can go to y=4 at t=62, then at t=62, I stay at y=4 or go down, but at t=63, if I stay at y=4, unsafe, go down to y=3 unsafe, etc.\n\nOnly way is to go to a safe position at t=63, like y=1, then from there go up.\n\nBut let's accept that and try to minimize the time to y=9 from y=1 at t=63.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=63, go up every turn: a63 U y64=2, a64 U y65=3, a65 U y66=4, a66 U y67=5, a67 U y68=6, a68 U y69=7, a69 U y70=8, a70 U y71=9.\n\nSo at t=71, y=9.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut I can save some time by going faster when possible.\n\nFor example, from t=63 y=1, I can go up to y=2 at t=64, then to y=3 at t=65, etc.\n\nBut same as above.\n\nOr, at some point I can go faster, but no, only one step per turn.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 6 is safe after t=62, I can go directly to y=6 as soon as possible.\n\nFrom t=61 y=3, a61 U, y62=4\n\nThen at t=62, y=4, I can do nothing for t=63, so I have to choose an action.\n\nIf I could skip, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps go down to y=3 at t=63, but unsafe.\n\nI think the only way is to go down to y=1 at t=63, then go up, but avoid the unsafe times on higher freeways.\n\nFor example, on y=7, unsafe at t=69,70,71.\n\nSo when going up, I need to not be on y=7 at those times.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSo from y=1 at t=63, I go up:\n\nt=63: y=1\n\na63=U, y64=2\n\nt=64: y=2\n\na64=U, y65=3\n\nt=65: y=3\n\na65=U, y66=4\n\na66=U, y67=5\n\na67=U, y68=6\n\nt=68: y=6\n\na68=U, y69=7\n\nBut at t=69, y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo at t=68, instead of U, I can stay: a68=S, y69=6\n\nt=69: y=6, safe.\n\nThen a69=U, y70=7\n\nt=70: y=7, Δt=9, unsafe.\n\na69=S, y70=6, then a70=U, y71=7, t=71 y=7, Δt=10, unsafe.\n\na69=U, y70=7, t=70 unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, at t=68, I can go down to y=5, a68=D, y69=5\n\nt=69: y=5, Δt=8, span [48-288,83-288]=[-240,-205], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen a69=U, y70=6\n\nt=70: y=6, Δt=9, span [-11+54,54]=[43,54], 0 not in, safe.\n\na70=U, y71=7\n\nt=71: y=7, Δt=10, unsafe.\n\nStill problem.\n\nAt t=70, on y=6, I can stay or go down.\n\nIf I go to y=7 at t=71, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at y=6, a70=S, y71=6, safe, but not progressing.\n\nThen a71=U, y72=7, t=72 y=7, Δt=11, freeway 7 at Δt=11: span first car [-43+44, -32+44]=[1,12], 0 not in; second car [21+44,32+44]=[65,76], 0 not in, so safe at Δt=11.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at Δt=12 might be safe, but let's see.\n\nSo from t=63 y=1:\n\na63=U, y64=2\n\na64=U, y65=3\n\na65=U, y66=4\n\na66=U, y67=5\n\na67=U, y68=6\n\na68=S, y69=6  (stay to avoid y=7 at bad time)\n\na69=S, y70=6  (stay again)\n\na70=U, y71=7  (now Δt=10, but freeway 7 at Δt=10: span [-43+40, -32+40]=[-3,8], 0 in, unsafe at t=71)\n\nt=71 is Δt=10, unsafe.\n\nΔt=T-61, T=71, Δt=10.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at Δt=8,9,10.\n\nΔt=10 is unsafe.\n\nSo at t=71, y=7, unsafe.\n\nTo be safe, I need to be on y=7 at Δt=11 or later.\n\nAt t=72, Δt=11, safe as above.\n\nSo from t=68 y=6, I can stay until t=71, then go up at t=71 to y=7 at t=72.\n\nt=68: y=6\n\na68=S, y69=6\n\na69=S, y70=6\n\na70=S, y71=6\n\na71=U, y72=7  (t=72, Δt=11, safe)\n\nThen a72=U, y73=8\n\nt=73: y=8, Δt=12, freeway 8, span [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\na73=U, y74=9\n\nt=74: y=9, done.\n\nBut this is many turns.\n\nFrom t=63 y=1, it took to t=74, 11 turns to go from y=1 to y=9, with 3 stays.\n\nBut net 8 steps in 11 turns.\n\nMinimal would be 8 turns, but with unsafe times, we added waits.\n\nNow, back to the start, at t=61, I went down to y=1 at t=63, which cost 2 turns to go down, then from there.\n\nBut I can go to y=6 faster if I can avoid the t=63 issue.\n\nNotice that at t=64, y=5 is safe, so if I can be at y=4 at t=63, but at t=63 y=4 unsafe, so I can't.\n\nUnless I am not on the freeway at t=63 for y=4.\n\nBut I have to be somewhere.\n\nAnother idea: at t=62, I am at y=4, I go up to y=5 at t=63, but at t=63 collision, so I can't.\n\nPerhaps the car on y=5 at t=63 covers x=0, but if I move quickly, but the collision is checked at the turn, so if I am on y=5 at t=63, and 0 covered, collision, I think I lose or something.\n\nSo I think the only way is to be on a safe freeway at t=63, which is only y=1 or y=6,7,8 but y=6,7,8 not reachable, so y=1.\n\nTherefore, I must go down to y=1 at t=63.\n\nThen from there, go up, but with waiting to avoid the unsafe times on y=7 and y=8.\n\nFor y=7, unsafe at t=69,70,71.\n\nSo I need to be on y=7 before or after.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nLet's plan the up path from y=1 at t=63.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe constraining freeways are y=7 and y=8 with unsafe times.\n\nUnsafe for y=7: t=69,70,71\n\nUnsafe for y=8: t=69,70,71,72\n\nI can be on y=7 at t=68 or t=72, for example.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nAlso, y=6 is always safe after t=62.\n\ny=5,4,3,2 are safe except at specific times, but since I am going up, and t is increasing, I can pass through quickly.\n\nFrom t=63 y=1:\n\nI can go up as fast as possible until y=6, then wait at y=6 until after t=71, then go to y=7 at t=72.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=73, and y=9 at t=74.\n\nBut let's see the times.\n\nt=63: y=1\n\na63=U, t=64: y=2\n\na64=U, t=65: y=3\n\na65=U, t=66: y=4\n\na66=U, t=67: y=5\n\na67=U, t=68: y=6\n\nNow at t=68, y=6, safe.\n\nI need to not be on y=7 until t=72.\n\nSo I can stay at y=6 from t=68 to t=71.\n\nThen at t=71, go up to y=7 at t=72.\n\nThen from there.\n\nSo:\n\nt=68: y=6\n\na68=S, t=69: y=6\n\na69=S, t=70: y=6\n\na70=S, t=71: y=6\n\na71=U, t=72: y=7 ( safe, Δt=11)\n\na72=U, t=73: y=8 ( Δt=12, safe)\n\na73=U, t=74: y=9\n\nSo position at t=74 y=9.\n\nH=14 actions? From t=63 to t=73 for actions, position at t=74.\n\nBut we start from t=61.\n\nAt t=61: y=3\n\na61=D, t=62: y=2\n\na62=D, t=63: y=1\n\nThen from t=63 to t=73 actions for going up and waiting.\n\nActions from t=61 to t=73, that's 13 actions, position at t=74.\n\nH= number of turns, from t=61 to t=61+H-1 =74, so 61+H-1=74, H-1=13, H=14.\n\nBut this is long.\n\nI can go faster to y=6.\n\nFrom t=63 y=1 to t=68 y=6 in 5 turns, good.\n\nThen at y=6, I stay for 3 turns to avoid the bad times.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut at t=68, I am at y=6, and I stay until t=71, then go to y=7 at t=72.\n\nBut at t=72, I go to y=7, then to y=8 at t=73, to y=9 at t=74.\n\nI could go directly from y=6 to y=8, but I can't, only one step.\n\nAnother way: since y=8 is safe at t=73, I can be on y=7 at t=72, then to y=8 at t=73, etc.\n\nBut I need to be on y=7 at a safe time.\n\nThe earliest safe time for y=7 after the unsafe period is t=72 (Δt=11).\n\nSimilarly for y=8, safe at t=73 (Δt=12) or later.\n\nUnsafe at t=69,70,71,72 for y=8? Δt=8 to 11.\n\nΔt=11: t=72, span [-35+33, -24+33]=[-2,9], 0 in, unsafe.\n\nΔt=12: t=73, span [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo y=8 safe for t<=68 or t>=73.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 safe for t<=67 or t>=72.\n\nt=67: Δt=6, freeway 7, span first car [-43+24, -32+24]=[-19,-8], 0 not in; second car [21+24,32+24]=[45,56], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=68: Δt=7, first car [-43+28, -32+28]=[-15,-4], 0 not in; second car [21+28,32+28]=[49,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=69: Δt=8, unsafe as before.\n\nSo y=7 safe for t<=68 or t>=72.\n\ny=8 safe for t<=67 or t>=73.\n\nt=67: Δt=6, freeway 8, span [-35+18, -24+18]=[-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=68: Δt=7, span [-35+21, -24+21]=[-14,-3], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=69: Δt=8, unsafe.\n\nSo safe for t<=68 or t>=73.\n\nNow, from the up path from y=1 at t=63, I can be at y=6 at t=68.\n\nThen I can go to y=7 at t=69, but unsafe, so I should go to y=7 at t=72.\n\nBut at t=68, I am at y=6, I can go to y=7 at t=69, but unsafe, so I must stay at y=6 until t=71, then go to y=7 at t=72.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=73, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=74.\n\nIf I go to y=7 at t=68, which is safe, from y=6 at t=68, I can go to y=7 at t=69.\n\nAt t=68, y=6, action a68=U, y69=7.\n\nAt t=69, y=7, unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot do that.\n\nI can only go to y=7 at a time when it is safe, like t=68 or t=72.\n\nAt t=68, I can be on y=6 or y=7, but to be on y=7 at t=68, I need to arrive at t=68 from y=6 at t=67 with U action.\n\nBut in our path, at t=67, y=5, then a67 U, y68=6, so at t=68, y=6, not y=7.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=68, I need to be at y=6 at t=67, then a67 U, y68=7.\n\nBut from y=1 at t=63, can I reach y=6 at t=67?\n\nt=63: y=1\n\na63 U, t=64: y=2\n\na64 U, t=65: y=3\n\na65 U, t=66: y=4\n\na66 U, t=67: y=5\n\na67 U, t=68: y=6\n\nSo at t=68 y=6, not y=7.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=68, I need y=7 at t=68, so from t=67 y=6, a67 U, y68=7.\n\nBut at t=67, y=6, which requires y=5 at t=66, etc.\n\nFrom t=63 y=1 to t=68 y=7: 5 steps, but from y=1 to y=7 is 6 steps, so in 5 turns from t=63 to t=67 position, impossible.\n\nMinimal to y=7 from y=1 is 6 turns: t=63 y=1, t=64 y=2, ..., t=68 y=5, t=69 y=6, t=70 y=7.\n\nSo at t=70 y=7, but t=70 is unsafe for y=7.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=7 at a safe time like t=68 because I can't reach fast enough.\n\nSimilarly, the only way is to be on y=7 at t=72 or later.\n\nSo in the path, from y=6 at t=68, I stay until t=71, then go to y=7 at t=72.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=73, safe, then to y=9 at t=74.\n\nSo the sequence from t=61:\n\nt=61: y=3, a61=D, y62=2\n\nt=62: y=2, a62=D, y63=1\n\nt=63: y=1, a63=U, y64=2\n\nt=64: y=2, a64=U, y65=3\n\nt=65: y=3, a65=U, y66=4\n\nt=66: y=4, a66=U, y67=5\n\nt=67: y=5, a67=U, y68=6\n\nt=68: y=6, a68=S, y69=6\n\nt=69: y=6, a69=S, y70=6\n\nt=70: y=6, a70=S, y71=6\n\nt=71: y=6, a71=U, y72=7\n\nt=72: y=7, a72=U, y73=8\n\nt=73: y=8, a73=U, y74=9\n\nPosition at t=74 y=9.\n\nH=14.\n\nBut this seems too long, and probably not minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can go up from y=3 at t=61 to y=4 at t=62, then at t=62, instead of moving, but I have to, so I go down to y=3 at t=63, but unsafe.\n\nI think I have to accept the down to y=1.\n\nMaybe for freeway 6, it is safe at t=63, so if I can be on y=6 at t=63.\n\nBut from y=3 at t=61, impossible.\n\nUnless I start from lower, but I start at y=3.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at t=61, I go up to y=4 at t=62, then at t=62, I go down to y=3 at t=63, but unsafe, or to y=5, impossible.\n\nI think it's impossible to avoid the collision at t=63 without going down to y=1 or similar.\n\nPerhaps the car on y=5 at t=63 only covers x=0 at that instant, and if I move, but the collision is at the turn, so I think it's unavoidable if I am there.\n\nSo I believe the minimal way is to go down to y=1 at t=63, then go up with waiting.\n\nBut to minimize H, I can reduce the waiting.\n\nFor example, on the way up, when I reach y=6, I can go to y=7 as soon as it is safe after the unsafe period.\n\nUnsafe for y=7 ends at t=71, so at t=72 I can be on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, I can be on y=6 at an earlier time.\n\nFor example, from t=63 y=1, I can go up faster.\n\nBut I am going as fast as possible to y=6.\n\nAt t=68 y=6.\n\nThen I wait until t=71, then go to y=7 at t=72.\n\nBut at t=68, y=6, I can go to y=7 at t=69, but unsafe, so I must wait.\n\nUnless I am at y=6 earlier.\n\nFrom t=63 y=1, to t=68 y=6, that's 5 turns for 5 steps, minimal.\n\nIf I start from higher, but I had to go down.\n\nAt t=61, instead of going down twice, I can go down once to y=2 at t=62, then to y=1 at t=63, same as before.\n\nOr at t=61, go directly to y=1, but I can't, only to y=2.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps for the freeway 6, it is safe at t=63, and if I can reach it.\n\nBut from y=3, I can reach y=6 at t=64 earliest, with a61 U y62=4, a62 U y63=5, a63 U y64=6, but at t=63 y=5 collision, so I can't.\n\nSo I think it's not possible, and I have to use the down path.\n\nSo let's assume that and write the sequence.\n\nBut H=14 is large, and perhaps I missed something.\n\nLet's check the car on freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6: car (0,-11,right,6), at t=61, span [-11,0], so at x=0 covered.\n\nAt t=62, span [-5,6], covered.\n\nAt t=63, [1,12], not covered.\n\nBut to be on y=6 at t=63, I need to be there.\n\nBut from start, can't.\n\nPerhaps the player can move to a freeway where the car is not covering at that time.\n\nBut for t=63, only y=1 is safe among reachable positions.\n\nSo I think for minimal turns, with the down and up, H=14.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach y=9 sooner.\n\nSuppose at t=61, I go down to y=2: a61=D, y62=2\n\nThen at t=62, I go down to y=1: a62=D, y63=1\n\nThen from t=63 y=1, I go up, but to avoid the y=7 unsafe, I can go slower or faster.\n\nFor example, if I go slower to y=6, then I can reach y=7 later.\n\nBut going slower means more turns.\n\nFor example, from t=63 y=1, I can stay at some point to delay.\n\nBut that would make H larger.\n\nSo the fastest is to go up as fast as possible to y=6 at t=68, then wait at y=6 until t=71, then go to y=7 at t=72, etc.\n\nSo H=14 is the best I can think of.\n\nBut let's confirm the number.\n\nActions from t=61 to t=73: that's 13 actions (t=61 to t=73 inclusive is 13 turns? t=61,62,63,...,73, that's 13 actions.\n\nPosition after action at t=73 is y74=9.\n\nTurn when position is 9 is t=74.\n\nt=61 + (H-1) =74, so H-1=13, H=14.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 directly from y=6, but no.\n\nAnother idea: at t=68 y=6, I can go to y=7 at t=69, but unsafe, so not.\n\nOr, since y=8 is safe at t=68, I can go to y=8 at t=69 from y=7 at t=68, but I am not at y=7.\n\nI think I have to accept this.\n\nSo for the sequence:\n\nTurn t_61: D\n\nTurn t_62: D\n\nTurn t_63: U\n\nTurn t_64: U\n\nTurn t_65: U\n\nTurn t_66: U\n\nTurn t_67: U\n\nTurn t_68: S\n\nTurn t_69: S\n\nTurn t_70: S\n\nTurn t_71: U\n\nTurn t_72: U\n\nTurn t_73: U\n\nThen at t=74, y=9.\n\nBut at t=73, action U, y74=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=61 to t=73.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be the actions.\n\nNow, to write for the box.\n\nBut H=14, and the position is reached at turn t=74.\n\nBut let's see if I can reduce the waiting.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=7 at t=72, which is safe, then to y=8 at t=73, safe, to y=9 at t=74.\n\nBut at t=73, on y=8, safe as above.\n\nCan I be on y=7 at t=72 from earlier?\n\nFor example, if I am at y=6 at t=71, then a71 U, y72=7.\n\nTo be at y=6 at t=71, from y=1 at t=63, that's 8 steps, t=63 to t=71 is 8 turns, position at t=71 y=1+8=9, but I am at y=6, so not.\n\nFrom t=63 y=1 to t=71, 8 actions, position at t=71 y=1+8=9 if all up, but I need to be at y=6 at t=71, so I must have down or stay, which would make y lower or same.\n\nSo to be at y=6 at t=71, I must have net +5 from y=1 in 8 turns, so I can have 3 stays or 3 down and up, but it would take more turns, not better.\n\nSo the path I have is fine.\n\nPerhaps for the initial move, instead of going down to y=1, I can go to y=0, but y=0 is not a freeway, so no collision, but y=0 is below, and I have to go up from there, same as y=1.\n\ny=0 has no freeway, so at any turn, on y=0, no collision.\n\nSimilarly for y=9.\n\nSo at t=63, I can be on y=0 or y=9 or y=1.\n\ny=9 not reachable, y=0 reachable.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=61, a61=D, y62=2, a62=D, y63=1, then a63=D, y64=0.\n\nAt t=64, y=0, no collision.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut y=0 to y=9, 9 steps, so more turns.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo better to go to y=1 at t=63 and go up.\n\nI think H=14 is the best.\n\nSo for the answer, the sequence of actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=68,69,70 I stay at y=6.\n\nNow to write the actions.\n\nTurn t_61: D\n\nTurn t_62: D\n\nTurn t_63: U\n\nTurn t_64: U\n\nTurn t_65: U\n\nTurn t_66: U\n\nTurn t_67: U\n\nTurn t_68: S\n\nTurn t_69: S\n\nTurn t_70: S\n\nTurn t_71: U\n\nTurn t_72: U\n\nTurn t_73: U\n\nThen at t=74, y=9.\n\nH=13 actions? t=61 to t=73 is 13 actions.\n\nH= number of turns, from t=61 to t=61+H-1.\n\nPosition at t=61+H-1 =9.\n\nt=74, so 61+H-1=74, H-1=13, H=14.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the sequence, the last action is at t=73 for U to y=9 at t=74.\n\nNow for the box.\n\nBut let's see if I can do with less by not going down to y=1.\n\nSuppose at t=61, a61=U, y62=4\n\nThen at t=62, a62=S, but y63=4, unsafe.\n\nOr a62=D, y63=3, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps the cars on multiple freeways, but I think not.\n\nAnother thought: for freeway 4 and 5, they have the same car state, but at different times.\n\nBut I think I have to conclude.\n\nSo the minimal H is 14.\n\nBut let's write the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0,

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 63. I start at y=0 and need to reach y=9.\n\nThe player moves up, down, or stays with actions U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. Since I start at 0 and need to go to 9, I probably need to move up most of the time, but I have to avoid cars when I'm on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes over time based on the car's speed and direction.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, if I move to a different y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, I'm on y_T, and if I move, at turn T+1 I'm on y_{T+1}. So I don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, only at T+1.\n\nThe car positions are given for turn t_1=63, and I need to compute where they are at future turns relative to t_1.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t_1, so at turn T = t_1 + Δt.\n\nFor each car, the span at time T is:\n\nFor left-moving (d=left): span(T) = [h - s * Δt, τ - s * Δt]\n\nIn the table, for left-moving, it says: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\n\nBut for right-moving, it says: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: at t_1, head h, tail τ, so span is [h, τ] if h > τ, I assume? But it says [h, τ] for left-moving, and for right-moving, it says [τ, h], so probably for left-moving, head is larger, tail smaller, so car extends from τ to h with τ < h? No.\n\nTypically, head is the front, tail is the back. For left-moving, head is on the left, so as it moves left, head decreases. Similarly for right-moving.\n\nLet's see the notation.\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48) — so head h=-48, tail τ=-95, direction right, speed 48.\n\nSince it's right-moving, and head is -48, tail is -95, which is less than -48, so tail is left, head is right? But if it's moving right, head should be on the right.\n\nτ=-95, h=-48, since -48 > -95, so h > τ, and it's moving right. In the span, for right-moving, they say Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-95, -48], which from left to right, so τ is left end, h is right end.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36) — h=48, τ=83? τ=83 > h=48? That can't be right.\n\nFreeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36) — but it says head h, tail τ, and for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [48, 83], but 48 to 83, if moving left, head should be on the left, but 48 < 83, so from 48 to 83 is rightward? I'm confused.\n\nLet's read the car update rules again.\n\n\"For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t_1, and speed is s.\"\n\nThen for left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48) — so for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-95, -48], and it moves right, so at T, [ -95 + s Δt, -48 + s Δt]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36) — for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [48, 83], and moves left, so at T, [48 - s Δt, 83 - s Δt]\n\nBut [48,83] with 48<83, so it's from 48 to 83, which is increasing x, so if moving left, head at 48? But 48 is left, and it's moving left, so head should decrease.\n\nPerhaps the head and tail are defined such that for left-moving, head is on the right? I think there's inconsistency.\n\nLet's look at freeway 2: (48, 37, right, 12) — for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [37, 48]? But it says (head h, tail τ) = (48,37), so h=48, τ=37, for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [37,48], so τ is left end, h is right end.\n\nSimilarly, (0, -11, right, 12) on same freeway, Span(t_1) = [-11, 0].\n\nFor left-moving, freeway 4: (48,83, left,36), head h=48, tail τ=83, so for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [48,83], so from 48 to 83, with h=48 < τ=83, so head is at 48, tail at 83, but if moving left, the head should be at the left when moving left, but here 48 is less than 83, so 48 is left, 83 is right, so from left to right, head at left, tail at right? But when moving left, the front should be at left, so head at smaller x.\n\nI think I have it: for a car, the head is the front, tail is the back, regardless of direction.\n\nFor a left-moving car, front (head) is on the left, so at position x, as it moves left, head decreases.\n\nFor a right-moving car, front (head) is on the right, so as it moves right, head increases.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, at t_1, head at h, tail at τ, with h < τ because tail is behind, so for left-moving, h < τ, span [h, τ] from low to high.\n\nFor right-moving, head at h, tail at τ, with h > τ, since head is front, tail back, so for right-moving, τ < h, span [τ, h].\n\nIn the notation, for freeway 4 left-moving: (48,83,left,36), so h=48, τ=83, and since left-moving, h < τ, span [48,83].\n\nAs it moves left, both decrease: [48 - s Δt, 83 - s Δt]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 1 right-moving: (-48,-95,right,48), h=-48, τ=-95, since right-moving, τ < h, τ=-95, h=-48, span [τ,h] = [-95,-48], moves right to [-95 + s Δt, -48 + s Δt]\n\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in the car's span at T, meaning min(span) <= 0 <= max(span).\n\nAlso, note that if at turn T, I am on y_T, and I move to y_{T+1} at turn T, but at turn T, I am still on y_T for collision purpose, and I only occupy y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but not Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut since I'm not on y_{T+1} at turn T, I don't care about cars on y_{T+1} at turn T anyway. Collision only for the freeway I'm on at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, I am on freeway y_T. I check if for freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at T.\n\nIf I move, at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, and I check for freeway y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nSo, for each turn, I need to ensure that for the y I am on, no car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nI start at turn t_1=63, position (0,0). y=0 is not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0, no cars, so I am safe at turn 63, since no freeway at y=0.\n\nSimilarly, when I reach y=9, it's the goal, no freeway, so no collision.\n\nBut I need to be on y=9 at some turn, and since it's not a freeway, no issue.\n\nThe player position is (0,y), and freeways are at y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9, passing through y=1 to 8, but avoiding collisions on those freeways at the turns I am on them.\n\nEach turn, I choose an action U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nI need to minimize the number of turns H, so I want to go up as fast as possible, but I may need to wait or move down to avoid cars.\n\nSince y must be integer, and I start at 0, end at 9, minimum turns if no obstacles is 9 turns: U each time. But with cars, I might need more.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars for each freeway at t_1=63.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, right-moving: head h=-48, tail τ=-95, speed s=48, direction right. Span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-95, -48]\n\nAt time T, span = [-95 + 48*(T-63), -48 + 48*(T-63)]\n\nCollision if player on y=1 at turn T and 0 in span, i.e., -95 + 48*(T-63) <= 0 <= -48 + 48*(T-63)\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nSince the player moves in y, and cars move in x, collision depends on the turn when player is on that y.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find when it is safe to be on that freeway, i.e., when no car on that lane has 0 in its span.\n\nBut there might be multiple cars on a freeway.\n\nLet's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway k | Cars\n\n1: only one car: (-48, -95, right, 48) → for right-moving, span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-95, -48]\n\n2: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12) → both right-moving.\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, span [37,48] at t_1\n\nSecond car: h=0, τ=-11, span [-11,0] at t_1\n\n3: same as freeway 2? \"3 | (48, 37, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12) \" identical to freeway 2? Probably a typo or same setup.\n\nIn the table, freeway 3 has the same as freeway 2: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as freeway 4? Freeway 4: (48,83,left,36) only one? \"4 | (48, 83, left, 36)\" and \"5 | (48, 83, left, 36)\" same.\n\nFreeway 6: (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4)\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,3)\n\nLet's list all:\n\nFreeway 1: one car, right, s=48, span at t_1: [-95, -48]\n\nFreeway 2: two cars, both right, s=12:\n\n- Car A: [37,48]\n\n- Car B: [-11,0]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2: [37,48] and [-11,0] both right s=12\n\nFreeway 4: one car, left, s=36, h=48, τ=83, left-moving, span at t_1 [48,83] since h=48, τ=83, h<τ for left.\n\nFor left-moving, span [h,τ] = [48,83]\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same as 4, [48,83] left s=36\n\nFreeway 6: one car, right, s=6, h=-48, τ=-59, right-moving, span [τ,h] = [-59,-48]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars, both right, s=4:\n\n- Car A: h=48, τ=37, span [37,48]\n\n- Car B: h=0, τ=-11, span [-11,0]\n\nFreeway 8: one car, right, s=3, h=-48, τ=-59, span [τ,h] = [-59,-48]\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when 0 is covered by some car on that freeway.\n\nSince cars move, the span changes with time.\n\nLet Δt = T - 63, so at turn T = 63 + Δt.\n\nFor each freeway, for each car, find when 0 is in its span at T.\n\nThen for the freeway, it is unsafe at T if any car has 0 in span.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nThen, for the player, when moving through the freeways, I need to be on each y from 1 to 8 at some turn when it is safe for that y.\n\nBut since I can stay or move up/down, I can choose when to be on each row.\n\nThe minimal H might require me to reach y=9 as soon as possible, so I should move up as much as possible, but avoid unsafe times.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at t=63, and I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nLet me find for each freeway y=1 to 8, the set of turns T where it is safe to be on that row.\n\nFirst, freeway 1 (y=1):\n\nOne car: span at T: [-95 + 48 Δt, -48 + 48 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -95 + 48 Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 48 Δt\n\nWhich is:\n\n-95 + 48 Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 48 Δt\n\nSo 48 Δt <= 95 and 48 Δt >= 48\n\nΔt <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so Δt <= 1 since integer? Turns are discrete, so Δt integer.\n\nΔt = T - 63, integer.\n\nSo 48 Δt >= 48 ⇒ Δt >= 1\n\n48 Δt <= 95 ⇒ Δt <= 95/48 = 1.979, so Δt <= 1\n\nΔt >=1 and Δt <=1, so Δt=1\n\nThus 0 in span only when Δt=1, i.e., T=64\n\nFor other Δt, not in span.\n\nFor example, at Δt=0, T=63, span [-95,-48], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=1, T=64, span [-95+48, -48+48] = [-47, 0], so 0 in span? -47 <=0<=0, yes.\n\nΔt=2, T=65, span [-95+96, -48+96] = [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for Δt<1 or >1, not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe only at T=64.\n\nSafe at all other times.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: right, s=12, span at t_1 [37,48]\n\nAt T, span [37 + 12 Δt, 48 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span if 37 + 12 Δt <= 0 <= 48 + 12 Δt\n\nBut 37 + 12 Δt <=0? Since Δt >=0, 37+12Δt >=37>0, so always >0, never <=0. Thus 0 never in span for first car.\n\nSecond car: right, s=12, span at t_1 [-11,0]\n\nAt T, span [-11 + 12 Δt, 0 + 12 Δt] = [-11 + 12 Δt, 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 12 Δt <= 0 <= 12 Δt\n\nWhich is -11 + 12 Δt <= 0 ⇒ 12 Δt <=11 ⇒ Δt <= 11/12 <1, so Δt <=0 since integer\n\nAnd 0 <= 12 Δt ⇒ Δt >=0\n\nSo at Δt=0, T=63, span [-11,0], 0 in span? -11 <=0<=0, yes.\n\nFor Δt>0, 12 Δt >=12>0, so 0 <= 12 Δt true, but -11 +12 Δt >= -11 +12*1=1>0 for Δt>=1, so -11+12Δt >0, thus 0 not <= upper bound?

No, if I do S, y stays 0.\n\nt=63, y=0.\n\nIf I do S at t=63, then y_{64} = y_{63} =0, so at t=64, I am still at y=0.\n\nThen I can act at t=64.\n\nIf I do U at t=63, then y_{64} = y_{63} +1 =1, so at t=64, I am on y=1.\n\nBut y=1 is unsafe at t=64, so collision, not allowed.\n\nIf I do D at t=63, y_{64} =0-1= -1, but y must be in [0,9], so invalid, I assume action D not possible at y=0, since y=-1 not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, U not possible.\n\nSo at y=0, only U or S possible.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, only D or S.\n\nBut since we start at y=0, end at y=9.\n\nAt t=63, y=0, possible actions: U or S.\n\nIf U, then at t=64, y=1, but unsafe, collision.\n\nSo I cannot do U at t=63.\n\nMust do S at t=63, so at t=64, y=0.\n\nNow t=64, y=0.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nNow, at t=64, I can do U or S.\n\nIf I do U, at t=65, y=1.\n\nNow, is y=1 safe at t=65?\n\ny=1 unsafe only at t=64, as we saw, so at t=65, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I do S, stay at y=0.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nSo at t=64, do U, then at t=65, y=1.\n\nt=65, y=1, which is safe since only unsafe at t=64.\n\nNow, at t=65, I am on y=1.\n\nI can do U, D, or S.\n\nIf I do U, at t=66, y=2.\n\nNow, y=2 unsafe only at t=63, which is past, so at t=66, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 unsafe only at t=63, safe at t=66.\n\nBut let's go step by step.\n\nAt t=65, y=1, safe.\n\nI want to go to y=2.\n\ny=2 is safe except at t=63, so for t>63, always safe except possibly other times, but from earlier, only unsafe at t=63, so for t>=64, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=3 only unsafe at t=63.\n\nNow, at t=65, I can do U to go to y=2 at t=66.\n\nBut at t=65, I am on y=1, I do action for next position.\n\nAt turn t, I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at t=65, if I do U, then y_{66} = y_{65} +1 =1+1=2.\n\nSo at turn t=66, I am on y=2.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSince y=2 is safe at t=66, yes.\n\nI could do S at t=65, stay at y=1 for another turn, but no need.\n\nOr D, but y=0, waste.\n\nSo better to go up.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nBut we have later unsafe times for y=6 and y=8.\n\nFirst, let's see if I can go straight up without delay except the initial wait.\n\nStart:\n\nt=63: at y=0, must do S (since U causes collision at t=64)\n\nSo action S, y remains 0.\n\nt=64: at y=0, I do U, so y_{65} = 0 +1 =1, so at t=65, on y=1.\n\nt=65: at y=1, safe (since t=65 ≠64). I do U, so y_{66} =1+1=2, at t=66, on y=2.\n\ny=2 safe at t=66 (since unsafe only t=63).\n\nt=66: at y=2, do U, y_{67}=3, at t=67 on y=3.\n\ny=3 safe at t=67.\n\nt=67: at y=3, do U, y_{68}=4, at t=68 on y=4.\n\nNow, y=4 unsafe only at t=65, which is past, so safe at t=68.\n\nt=68: at y=4, do U, y_{69}=5, at t=69 on y=5.\n\ny=5 unsafe only at t=65, safe at t=69.\n\nt=69: at y=5, do U, y_{70}=6, at t=70 on y=6.\n\nNow, y=6 unsafe at T=71 and 72.\n\nAt t=70, on y=6.\n\nIs y=6 safe at t=70? From earlier, unsafe only at 71,72, so at t=70, safe.\n\nI need to go to y=7.\n\nBut y=7 unsafe at t=63,64,65.\n\nt=70 is later, so safe? y=7 unsafe only at t=63,64,65, as per earlier.\n\nAt t=70, should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 unsafe at 79-82, late.\n\nSo at t=70, I can do U to go to y=7 at t=71.\n\nBut at t=71, I would be on y=7.\n\nNow, y=7 unsafe at t=63,64,65, not at t=71, so safe.\n\nt=71, on y=7, safe.\n\nThen do U, y_{72}=8, at t=72 on y=8.\n\nNow, y=8 unsafe at t=79,80,81,82.\n\nt=72 is before, so safe? y=8 unsafe only at those times, so at t=72, safe.\n\nThen at t=72, on y=8, do U, y_{73}=9, at t=73 on y=9, goal.\n\nBut at t=72, I am on y=8, which is safe, then to y=9 at t=73.\n\nBut y=6 is unsafe at t=71 and 72.\n\nIn this path, at t=70, I am on y=6, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=70, I do U, so at t=71, I am on y=7.\n\nAt t=71, y=7 is safe, as above.\n\nBut at t=71, I am not on y=6; I am on y=7.\n\ny=6 is unsafe at t=71, but I am not on y=6 at t=71.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt t=70: on y=6, safe (since unsafe only 71,72)\n\nAction: U, so at t=71: on y=7, which is safe.\n\nAt t=71: on y=7, safe.\n\nAction: U, so at t=72: on y=8.\n\nNow, at t=72, on y=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=79-82, not 72, so safe.\n\nThen action U, at t=73: on y=9, goal.\n\nBut what about y=6 at t=71? I was on y=6 at t=70, and moved away.\n\nAt t=71, I am on y=7, not y=6.\n\nThe unsafe for y=6 is only if I am on y=6 at t=71 or t=72.\n\nBut in this case, I am on y=6 only at t=70, which is safe, and at t=71 I am on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, at t=72, I am on y=8.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nIn this path, I reach y=9 at t=73.\n\nNow, let's list the actions:\n\nt=63: S (stay at y=0)\n\nt=64: U (to y=1 at t=65? No.\n\nActions at turn t determine next y.\n\nTurn t: action a_t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y_t.\n\nStart at turn t_1=63, position (0, y_{63}) = (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_{63}, y_{64} = y_{63} + delta y_{63}\n\nThen at turn 64, position is (0, y_{64}), and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T if on freeway y_T and unsafe.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt turn 63: y=0, action: since U would make y_{64}=1, but at T=64, on y=1, unsafe, so cannot U.\n\nDo S, so y_{64} = y_{63} + 0 = 0\n\nAt turn 64: position y=0, which is safe. Action: do U, so y_{65} = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nAt turn 65: position y=1, which is safe (t=65 ≠64). Action: U, so y_{66} =1 +1 =2\n\nAt turn 66: y=2, safe. Action: U, y_{67}=3\n\nTurn 67: y=3, safe. Action: U, y_{68}=4\n\nTurn 68: y=4, safe. Action: U, y_{69}=5\n\nTurn 69: y=5, safe. Action: U, y_{70}=6\n\nTurn 70: y=6, safe (t=70 not 71 or 72). Action: U, y_{71}=7\n\nTurn 71: y=7, safe (t=71 not 63,64,65). Action: U, y_{72}=8\n\nTurn 72: y=8, safe (t=72 not 79-82). Action: U, y_{73}=9\n\nAt turn 73: y=9, goal.\n\nH = number of actions? From t=63 to t=73, that's 10 turns? Let's see the turns.\n\nStart at turn t=63, after H actions, we are at turn t + H, position at that turn.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=63 to t=63 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have done H steps, and at turn t_1 + H, we are at position.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn T, we have position y_T.\n\nAction a_T is taken at turn T, affecting y_{T+1}.\n\nWe start at turn t_1=63, y=0.\n\nWe perform actions at turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to some turn.\n\nAfter last action, at turn t_1 + H, we have y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThe actions are a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nNumber of actions is H.\n\nIn this case, from above:\n\nAt t=63: action, then at t=64: position y\n\nAfter action at t=63, y_{64} set.\n\nThen at t=64, action, y_{65} set, and so on.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nStart: t=63, y=0.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 63 + H, y=9.\n\nIn the path above:\n\n- Action at t=63: S, so y_{64} =0\n\n- Action at t=64: U, so y_{65} =1\n\n- Action at t=65: U, so y_{66} =2\n\n- Action at t=66: U, so y_{67} =3\n\n- Action at t=67: U, so y_{68} =4\n\n- Action at t=68: U, so y_{69} =5\n\n- Action at t=69: U, so y_{70} =6\n\n- Action at t=70: U, so y_{71} =7\n\n- Action at t=71: U, so y_{72} =8\n\n- Action at t=72: U, so y_{73} =9\n\nNow, at turn t=73, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=63 to t=72, that's 10 actions: t=63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72.\n\nH=10.\n\nt_1 + H =63 + H, at this turn y=9.\n\nHere 63 + H =73, so H=10.\n\nActions at t=63 to t=72, 10 actions.\n\nBut is this minimal? I had to wait one turn at start.\n\nWithout obstacles, min H=9, with U each turn from t=63 to t=71, y_{72}=9? Let's see.\n\nIf no cars, at t=63, U, y_{64}=1; t=64 U, y_{65}=2; ... up to t=71 U, y_{72}=9. So 9 actions, from t=63 to t=71, H=9.\n\nBut with cars, at t=63 if U, y_{64}=1, but at t=64, y=1 unsafe, collision, so not possible.\n\nSo I must delay.\n\nIn this path, I used S at t=63, then U from t=64 to t=72.\n\nBut t=72 action U to y_{73}=9.\n\nI could go faster? For example, after the initial S, I go up.\n\nBut y=7 has unsafe at early times, but in this path I am on y=7 at t=71, which is fine.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=71 and 72, but I am on y=6 at t=70, which is safe, and move away.\n\nIs there a way to reach earlier?\n\nSuppose at t=63, I do S, y_{64}=0.\n\nt=64, I do U, y_{65}=1.\n\nt=65, on y=1, safe.\n\nNow, instead of going straight, but I need to go up.\n\nBut y=4 and y=5 unsafe at t=65, but at t=65 I am on y=1, not on y=4 or 5.\n\nIn this path, I reach y=4 at t=68, which is after t=65, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at t=69, safe.\n\nNow, what about y=6? Unsafe at t=71,72.\n\nIn the path, at t=70 on y=6, safe.\n\nIf I could be on y=6 earlier, but I came from below.\n\nFrom t=65 y=1, to t=66 y=2, t=67 y=3, t=68 y=4, t=69 y=5, t=70 y=6. So at t=70 on y=6.\n\nt=70 is before 71,72, safe.\n\nIf I could be faster, but I had to start with S, so I lose one turn.\n\nAt t=63, I must do S, cannot U.\n\nThen from t=64 to t=71, I can do U each, but at t=71, if I do U, y_{72}=8? Let's see:\n\nStart t=63: S, y_{64}=0\n\nt=64: U, y_{65}=1\n\nt=65: U, y_{66}=2\n\nt=66: U, y_{67}=3\n\nt=67: U, y_{68}=4\n\nt=68: U, y_{69}=5\n\nt=69: U, y_{70}=6\n\nt=70: U, y_{71}=7\n\nt=71: U, y_{72}=8\n\nt=72: need to go to y=9, so U, y_{73}=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt t=71, if I do U, y_{72}=8, then at t=72 on y=8, then U to y=9 at t=73.\n\nBut in the above, at t=72 I do U to y_{73}=9.\n\nBut I reach y=9 at t=73.\n\nIs there a way to reach at t=72?\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=72, that means at t=72, y=9.\n\nWhich requires that at t=71, y=8, and action U at t=71.\n\nBut at t=71, if I am on y=8, and do U.\n\nBut I need to be on y=8 at t=71.\n\nNow, y=8 unsafe at t=79-82, not 71, so safe.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at t=71, I need to have y_{71}=8.\n\ny_{71} set by action at t=70.\n\nAt t=70, y_{70} must be 7 or 8 or 9, but since action, if y_{70}=7, and U, y_{71}=8.\n\nOr if y_{70}=8, and S, y_{71}=8, etc.\n\nBut let's see the earliest I can be at higher y.\n\nStart t=63, must S, so y_{64}=0.\n\nThen t=64, U, y_{65}=1.\n\nt=65, U, y_{66}=2.\n\nt=66, U, y_{67}=3.\n\nt=67, U, y_{68}=4.\n\nt=68, U, y_{69}=5.\n\nt=69, U, y_{70}=6.\n\nNow at t=70, on y=6.\n\nTo have y_{71}=8, I need to do U twice? But each action changes y by at most 1, so I cannot jump.\n\nFrom y=6, at t=70, if I do U, y_{71}=7.\n\nIf I do U at t=70, y_{71}=7.\n\nThen at t=71, if U, y_{72}=8.\n\nThen at t=72, U, y_{73}=9.\n\nI cannot get to y=8 directly from y=6.\n\nSo the fastest is to reach y=9 at t=73 with H=10 actions.\n\nBut perhaps I can avoid the initial wait by going down, but at y=0, I cannot go down, only S or U.\n\nU causes immediate collision.\n\nS is only option.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nBut at y=6, if I stay or something, but no need, since I can go through safely at t=70.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the path, when I am on y=7 at t=71, y=7 unsafe at t=63,64,65, not 71, so fine.\n\ny=8 at t=72, safe.\n\nNow, but y=6 is unsafe at t=71 and 72, but I am not on it at those times.\n\nIn this sequence, I am on y=6 only at t=70, which is safe.\n\nAt t=71, I am on y=7, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=72, on y=8.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, with H=10, I can reach.\n\nBut is there a way with H=9?\n\nSuppose I reach y=9 at t=72.\n\nThen y_{72}=9.\n\nWhich means at t=71, y_{71}=8 or 9, and action at t=71 to set y_{72}=9.\n\nIf y_{71}=8, then U at t=71.\n\nIf y_{71}=9, S or D, but D not possible, S stays.\n\nBut to reach y_{71}=8 or 9.\n\nNow, y_{71} must be reached from below.\n\nAt t=70, y_{70} must be 7,8,9.\n\nIf y_{70}=7, then U at t=70 to y_{71}=8.\n\nThen U at t=71 to y_{72}=9.\n\nBut y_{71}=8.\n\nNow, to have y_{70}=7.\n\ny_{70}=7 requires at t=69, y_{69}=6 or7, etc.\n\nEarliest: start t=63, if I could do U, but cannot.\n\nMust do S at t=63, y_{64}=0.\n\nt=64, U, y_{65}=1\n\nt=65, U, y_{66}=2\n\nt=66, U, y_{67}=3\n\nt=67, U, y_{68}=4\n\nt=68, U, y_{69}=5\n\nt=69, U, y_{70}=6\n\nNow at t=70, y_{70}=6.\n\nTo have y_{71}=8, impossible, since can only change by 1.\n\nFrom y_{70}=6, action at t=70: if U, y_{71}=7\n\nThen at t=71, U, y_{72}=8\n\nThen need another action to reach y=9.\n\nBut at t=72, if U, y_{73}=9.\n\nStill t=73.\n\nIf at t=70, I do nothing, S, y_{71}=6, but then at t=71, if on y=6 and t=71, unsafe, collision.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=71, so if I stay on y=6 at t=71, collision.\n\nSo I must not be on y=6 at t=71 or t=72.\n\nIn the path above, at t=70 on y=6, I must leave by t=71.\n\nSo at t=70, I can go U to y=7 at t=71, safe.\n\nIf I go down, to y=5, but then I have to come back, which takes more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=70, on y=6, if I do D, y_{71}=5, then at t=71 on y=5, which is safe, but then I need to go up again, so more actions.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus minimal H is 10.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have 10 actions to reach at t=73.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe times.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=71 and 72.\n\nt=71 is turn 63+8=71, since Δt=8, T=71.\n\nSimilarly t=72.\n\nIn the path, at t=70, on y=6, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=7 at t=71.\n\nAt t=71, on y=7, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=8 at t=72.\n\nAt t=72, on y=8, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=9 at t=73.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the actions from t_1=63 onwards.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 63: S\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nAfter action at t=72, y_{73}=9, so at turn 73, we are at (0,9).\n\nH=10 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, the last action is at t=72, for t from 63 to 72 inclusive.\n\nNow, in the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nUp to the last action.\n\nHere t_1=63.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 63: S\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\n...\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nNow, I think that's it.\n\nBut earlier I thought about freeway 7, but in this path, I am on y=7 at t=71, which is safe, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at t=72, safe.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if at any point I am on an unsafe row.\n\nt=63: y=0, safe\n\nt=64: y=0, safe (after S at t=63)\n\nt=65: y=1, safe (only unsafe at t=64)\n\nt=66: y=2, safe (only unsafe at t=63)\n\nt=67: y=3, safe (only unsafe at t=63)\n\nt=68: y=4, safe (only unsafe at t=65)\n\nt=69: y=5, safe (only unsafe at t=65)\n\nt=70: y=6, safe (unsafe at 71,72, not 70)\n\nt=71: y=7, safe (unsafe at 63,64,65, not 71)\n\nt=72: y=8, safe (unsafe at 79-82, not 72)\n\nt=73: y=9, goal, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I can start later, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I do S multiple times, but then I reach later, H larger.\n\nSo minimal H=10.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 7 has cars, but in this path no issue.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 7 unsafe at t=63,64,65, but I am on y=7 at t=71, fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 63\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The unsafe times for each freeway, derived from the car states and their movement rules, are as follows:\n\n- Freeway 1 (\\(y = 1\\)): Unsafe only at turn 64.\n- Freeway 2 (\\(y = 2\\)): Unsafe only at turn 63.\n- Freeway 3 (\\(y = 3\\)): Unsafe only at turn 63.\n- Freeway 4 (\\(y = 4\\)): Unsafe only at turn 65.\n- Freeway 5 (\\(y = 5\\)): Unsafe only at turn 65.\n- Freeway 6 (\\(y = 6\\)): Unsafe at turns 71 and 72.\n- Freeway 7 (\\(y = 7\\)): Unsafe at turns 63, 64, and 65.\n- Freeway 8 (\\(y = 8\\)): Unsafe at turns 79, 80, 81, and 82.\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) required is 10, achieved by staying at \\(y = 0\\) for one turn to avoid the unsafe condition on \\(y = 1\\) at turn 64, then moving up continuously to \\(y = 9\\). The sequence ensures that the player is never on an unsafe freeway at an unsafe turn:\n\n- At turn 63, the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, as \\(y = 0\\) has no freeway). Action \\(S\\) (stay) is chosen to avoid moving to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 64, which is unsafe.\n- At turn 64, the player remains at \\(y = 0\\) (safe). Action \\(U\\) (up) is chosen to move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 65.\n- At turn 65, the player is at \\(y = 1\\) (safe, as turn 65 is not unsafe for \\(y = 1\\)). Action \\(U\\) is chosen to move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 66.\n- At turn 66, the player is at \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as turn 66 is not unsafe for \\(y = 2\\)). Action \\(U\\) is chosen to move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 67.\n- At turn 67, the player is at \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as turn 67 is not unsafe for \\(y = 3\\)). Action \\(U\\) is chosen to move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 68.\n- At turn 68, the player is at \\(y = 4\\) (safe, as turn 68 is not unsafe for \\(y = 4\\)). Action \\(U\\) is chosen to move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 69.\n- At turn 69, the player is at \\(y = 5\\) (safe, as turn 69 is not unsafe for \\(y = 5\\)). Action \\(U\\) is chosen to move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 70.\n- At turn 70, the player is at \\(y = 6\\) (safe, as turn 70 is not unsafe for \\(y = 6\\)). Action \\(U\\) is chosen to move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 71.\n- At turn 71, the player is at \\(y = 7\\) (safe, as turn 71 is not unsafe for \\(y = 7\\)). Action \\(U\\) is chosen to move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 72.\n- At turn 72, the player is at \\(y = 8\\) (safe, as turn 72 is not unsafe for \\(y = 8\\)). Action \\(U\\) is chosen to move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 73.\n\nAt turn 73, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\), which is the goal and has no freeway, so it is safe.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 64, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position y is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and there is a car on that freeway such that the car's span at turn T includes the x-coordinate 0 (which is the player's x).\n\nImportant note: When the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is still on row y_T. So at turn T, we check the car on row y_T. Then at turn T+1, the player is on row y_{T+1}.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1 (which is 64). For future turns T (>=64), the car positions will be computed as:\n\nFor a car at turn t1 with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s:\n\n- If left-moving (d = left): \n   At turn T, the span is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n- If right-moving (d = right):\n   At turn T, the span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the representation for right-moving cars is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). However, in the update for right-moving, the example shows: \n   Initially: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut the input for a right-moving car is given as (head, tail) but note that in the update rule for right-moving, the head is the larger coordinate? Actually, the update rule says:\n\nFor right-moving: [Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the input, the car is given as (head, tail). For example, on freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48). Here, head=0, tail=-47. Then at t1=64, the car is at [tau, h] = [-47, 0]. So we can interpret that the car extends from x=-47 to x=0 at turn 64.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: the input (head, tail) and the update: [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. For example, freeway 4: (12,47,left,36). Then at t1=64, the car is at [12,47] (if we take head=12 and tail=47, but note that in the update the span is [h, tau] and then moves left. However, if head=12 and tail=47, then the car is from 12 to 47? But then moving left, the head (which is the front) is 12 and it moves left? That would mean the car is actually from 12 to 47 and moving left would decrease both.\n\nBut note: the update rule for left-moving says: [h, tau] -> [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. So the entire car moves left.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: the representation of the car might be such that the head is the front. For left-moving, the front is the leftmost point? Or the rightmost? Actually, the update rule for left-moving: the head is at h and moves left, so h decreases. Similarly, for right-moving, the head is at h and moves right, so h increases.\n\nBut in the input for a right-moving car: (head, tail) = (0, -47) -> meaning the head is at 0 and the tail is at -47? Then the car spans from -47 to 0. Then when it moves right, both increase.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: (head, tail) = (12,47) -> meaning the head is at 12 and the tail at 47? Then the car is from 12 to 47? But that would be a car of length 35 (47-12+1?) and moving left, the head (which is the front) is at 12 and moves left, so the head becomes 12 - s*dt and the tail becomes 47 - s*dt.\n\nBut wait: if the car is moving left, the front should be the leftmost? But in this representation, the head is 12 and tail 47, so if it moves left, the head becomes 12 - s*dt and tail 47 - s*dt. Then the car is still from (12-s*dt) to (47-s*dt). So the front (the leading edge) is the leftmost point? Then head is the leftmost? Then for left-moving, head should be the leftmost, and for right-moving, head should be the rightmost? \n\nBut in the update rule for right-moving: [tau, h] -> [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]. And the input for right-moving is (head, tail) = (0, -47). Then the update rule uses [tau, h] = [-47, 0]? So the car spans from -47 to 0? Then the head is 0 (the rightmost) and the tail is -47 (the leftmost). \n\nSo to clarify:\n\n- For a right-moving car: head is the rightmost coordinate, tail is the leftmost.\n- For a left-moving car: head is the leftmost coordinate, tail is the rightmost.\n\nBut in the input for left-moving: freeway 4: (12,47,left,36). Then head=12 (leftmost) and tail=47 (rightmost). The car spans from 12 to 47.\n\nNow, collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (so y_T = k) and there exists a car on freeway k such that 0 is in [left_end, right_end] of the car at turn T.\n\nFor a right-moving car at turn T: \n   left_end = tau + s*(T-t1)\n   right_end = head + s*(T-t1)\n\nFor a left-moving car at turn T:\n   left_end = head - s*(T-t1)\n   right_end = tail - s*(T-t1)\n\nBut note: the car spans an interval [min, max]. For right-moving: [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)] and for left-moving: [head - s*(T-t1), tail - s*(T-t1)].\n\nWe need to avoid being on a freeway row (y from 1 to 8) at a turn T when the car on that row has a span that includes 0.\n\nWe start at turn 64 at (0,0). We are not on a freeway (since freeways are 1-8) so no collision at turn 64. Our goal is to get to (0,9). Note that row 9 is the goal and not a freeway (so no cars there and no collision check on row 9).\n\nWe can only move one step per turn (or stay). We want the minimal H.\n\nWe are going to simulate the moves and check for collisions. We need to plan a sequence of actions that avoids collisions and gets to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and need to get to y=9, we must move up at least 9 times. But we might have to wait (by staying or even moving down) to avoid collisions.\n\nWe'll consider a BFS or Dijkstra-like approach in the state space (turn, y). However, the state space is continuous in time? Actually, the turns are discrete and y is discrete (0..9). But the car positions are functions of time (linear). So we can compute for any future turn the car positions.\n\nWe are going to consider states (t, y) where t is the current turn (>=64) and y in [0,9]. The initial state is (64,0). The goal is (any turn, 9). We want the minimal H (so minimal t - 64) such that we are at (t,9).\n\nThe actions: U, D, S. But note: if at y=0 and we try to go down, we stay at 0. Similarly, at y=9, we cannot go up? But we are at goal when we reach 9, so we don't need to move beyond.\n\nWe must avoid states (t, y) for y in [1,8] that are colliding with a car on freeway y at turn t.\n\nSo we can do a BFS in the state space (t, y) starting from (64,0). Since the minimal H is at least 9 (if we go straight up without waiting) and we might have to wait, but the car movements are linear and periodic? Actually, the car positions are linear in time, so the collision conditions are periodic? Not exactly, because the speeds are different.\n\nBut note: the grid is infinite in x, so the cars will eventually leave the x=0 point? But we need to check for each freeway and each turn.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each turn t (>=64) whether there is a car at x=0. However, the problem is that the state space in time is unbounded. But we are looking for the minimal H. Since we must go up at least 9 times, H is at least 9. And we can only move one step per turn, so the maximum y we can be at turn 64+H is H (if we go up every time). But we start at 0 and need to get to 9, so we must have H>=9.\n\nWe can try to simulate for H from 9 upwards until we find a path.\n\nBut note: we can also move down, so the path might be longer. However, we are minimizing H, so we try the smallest H first.\n\nGiven the complexity of the car movements, we will write a helper function to check for a collision at a given freeway k and turn t.\n\nLet t1 = 64.\n\nFor freeway k, we have a list of cars. For each car, we compute the span at turn t (relative to t1: dt = t - 64).\n\nFor a car (head, tail, d, s):\n\nif d == 'right':\n    left_end = tail + s * dt\n    right_end = head + s * dt\n    if left_end <= 0 <= right_end: then collision.\n\nif d == 'left':\n    left_end = head - s * dt\n    right_end = tail - s * dt\n    if left_end <= 0 <= right_end: then collision.\n\nBut note: the car might be given with head and tail such that for a right-moving car, tail <= head? Actually, for freeway 1: (0,-47,right,48): tail=-47, head=0 -> so at dt=0: left_end=-47, right_end=0 -> 0 is included? So at turn 64, on freeway 1, there is a car at 0? But we are at (0,0) at turn64 and freeway1 is y=1, so we are not on freeway1. But if we are on freeway1 at turn64, we would collide.\n\nNow, let's list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=0, tail=-47, d='right', s=48) -> at t64: [ -47, 0] -> includes 0? yes, so if we are on freeway1 at turn64, we collide.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12). \n   First car: head=60, tail=49 -> wait, but for right-moving: the tail should be the leftmost? Here tail=49 and head=60? Then the car spans [49,60]. At dt=0: [49,60] -> 0 not in [49,60]. \n   Second car: (12,1,right,12): tail=1, head=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12]. So at turn64, freeway2 is safe.\n\nBut wait: the representation: the update rule for right-moving uses [tau, head] and then moves. But the input gives (head, tail). So for the first car: head=60, tail=49 -> then the car is from 49 to 60? Then the tail is 49 (left) and head is 60 (right). Then at dt=0: left_end=49, right_end=60 -> 0 not included.\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=12, tail=1 -> [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway2? (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12) -> same as above.\n\nFreeway4: (12,47,left,36) -> head=12, tail=47, d='left'. \n   At dt=0: left_end = 12 - 0 = 12, right_end = 47 - 0 = 47 -> [12,47] -> 0 not included.\n\nFreeway5: same as freeway4.\n\nFreeway6: (-42,-53,right,6) -> head=-42, tail=-53? Then for right-moving: the car is from -53 to -42? Then at dt=0: left_end=-53, right_end=-42 -> 0 not included.\n\nFreeway7: two cars: (52,41,right,4) and (4,-7,right,4). \n   First car: head=52, tail=41 -> [41,52] -> 0 not included.\n   Second car: head=4, tail=-7 -> [-7,4] -> 0 is in [-7,4]! So at turn64, freeway7 has a car that covers 0? So if we are on freeway7 at turn64, we collide.\n\nFreeway8: (-45,-56,right,3) -> head=-45, tail=-56 -> car from -56 to -45 -> 0 not included.\n\nSo at turn64, the dangerous freeways (if we were on them) would be 1 and 7.\n\nWe are at y=0 at turn64, so safe.\n\nNow, we need to get to y=9. The minimal path would be to go up 9 times. But we must avoid collisions on the freeways we step on.\n\nWe plan to simulate the moves. We'll try to go up as fast as possible, but if we see that at a future turn we would collide on a freeway we are about to step on, we might wait (stay) or even move down to avoid.\n\nBut note: we can only change one row per turn.\n\nLet me try to compute the minimal path.\n\nWe start at turn64: y=0.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nWe consider the next turns.\n\nWe'll simulate for H=9,10,11,... until we find a sequence.\n\nWe'll use BFS:\n\nState: (t, y) where t is the current turn (>=64) and y in [0,9].\n\nWe start at (64,0) with path [].\n\nWe want to reach (t,9) for some t.\n\nWe'll consider the next actions: U, D, S.\n\nBut note: if we are at y=0 and do D, we stay at 0. Similarly, at y=9, if we do U, we stay at 9? But we are already at goal? Actually, we can stop when we first reach y=9.\n\nWe must avoid states that are colliding: that is, if y is between 1 and 8, then we check the freeway y at turn t: if any car on freeway y at turn t has a span that includes 0.\n\nWe'll write a function is_safe(t, y) that returns True if the state (t,y) is safe, else False.\n\nBut note: if y==0 or y==9, then no car, so safe.\n\nFor y in [1,8], we check all cars on that freeway at turn t.\n\nWe have the car list for each freeway at turn64.\n\nLet me code the car data:\n\ncars = {\n    1: [(0, -47, 'right', 48)],\n    2: [(60,49,'right',12), (12,1,'right',12)],\n    3: [(60,49,'right',12), (12,1,'right',12)],\n    4: [(12,47,'left',36)],\n    5: [(12,47,'left',36)],\n    6: [(-42,-53,'right',6)],\n    7: [(52,41,'right',4), (4,-7,'right',4)],\n    8: [(-45,-56,'right',3)]\n}\n\nNow, function for freeway k and turn t (t>=64):\n\ndt = t - 64\n\nfor each car in freeway k:\n    (head, tail, d, s) = car\n    if d == 'right':\n        left_end = tail + s * dt\n        right_end = head + s * dt\n        if left_end <= 0 <= right_end:\n            return False   # collision\n    elif d == 'left':\n        left_end = head - s * dt\n        right_end = tail - s * dt\n        if left_end <= 0 <= right_end:\n            return False\n\nIf none, return True.\n\nBut note: the car might be given with head and tail, and for a right-moving car, we have [tail + s*dt, head + s*dt] and for left: [head - s*dt, tail - s*dt].\n\nWe must be cautious about the order: the interval is [min, max] inclusive? The condition is if 0 is in [left_end, right_end] (assuming left_end<=right_end). But for a right-moving car, tail<=head so left_end = tail+s*dt, right_end=head+s*dt -> and tail+s*dt <= head+s*dt. Similarly, for left-moving: head-s*dt <= tail-s*dt? Actually, head is the leftmost at t1, and tail is the rightmost? Then head <= tail. Then head-s*dt <= tail-s*dt. So the interval is always [min, max].\n\nSo the condition is: if min <= 0 <= max.\n\nBut note: we are using <= for both ends? The problem says \"0 in Span(T)\", meaning if 0 is between the endpoints inclusive.\n\nSo the condition is: left_end <= 0 <= right_end.\n\nWe'll code that.\n\nNow, we do BFS. We start at (64,0). We mark visited states? The state is (t,y). But t can be large. However, the minimal H is at least 9. Also, we can only be at y in [0,9]. And we are minimizing t. We can use Dijkstra with cost = t - 64? Since we want minimal turns.\n\nActually, we are only moving one step per turn, so the cost of moving from (t,y) to (t+1,y') is 1.\n\nWe'll use a queue: each state is (t, y, path) where path is the sequence of actions from turn64 to turn t-1? Actually, we are at state (t,y) and the path has the actions for turns 64 to t-1? But we are going to generate the next action at turn t.\n\nWe start at (64,0) with path = [].\n\nThen, from (t,y), we consider:\n\n- If y==9: we are done. Output the path (which has H = t-64 actions? Actually, we have taken actions from turn64 to turn t-1? So the number of actions is (t-64). But the goal is reached at turn t, but we don't take an action at turn t to get to turn t? \n\nActually, at turn t, we are at state (t,y). We have taken the actions for turns 64,65,...,t-1 to get to (t,y). So if at turn t we are at y=9, we stop. The number of actions is (t-64).\n\nBut note: the problem says: we are to output the actions for turns t1, t1+1, ... until the turn when we reach (0,9). So the last action is the one that brings us to (0,9). For example, at turn t-1 we were at y=8, and then we do U at turn t-1 to get to y=9 at turn t? But wait, the update: at turn t-1, we do action a_{t-1}, then at turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nSo if we are at (t,y) and we want to be at (t,9), we don't need to take an action at turn t if we are already at 9? Actually, we are done at the moment we are at (t,9). The last action was taken at turn t-1.\n\nTherefore, when we are at state (t,y) and y==9, then we have the sequence of actions for turns 64 to t-1.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to output the actions for turns t1 (which is 64) to ... until the last action that brought us to 9. So the number of actions is H = t - 64.\n\nWe are to output:\n\nTurn 64: a_64\n...\nTurn t-1: a_{t-1}\n\nWe'll generate the next states:\n\nAt state (t,y), we consider the next action (to be taken at turn t) which will lead to state (t+1, y'):\n\n- If we do U: y' = min(y+1, 9) -> but if y<9, then y'=y+1; if y==9, then y'=9.\n- If we do D: y' = max(y-1, 0)\n- If we do S: y' = y\n\nBut note: we are bounded to [0,9].\n\nThen the next state is (t+1, y').\n\nBut we must check the next state for collision? Actually, we check the state (t+1, y') for collision? \n\nWait: the collision condition is at the turn when the player is at a position. At turn t, we are at (0,y_t). Then we choose an action a_t, which will update the player to y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nBut note: during turn t, we are present at y_t. And we must check that at turn t, if y_t is in [1,8], then we must not collide with a car on freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nSimilarly, when we are at (t+1, y_{t+1}), we check at turn t+1: if y_{t+1} in [1,8] then check collision.\n\nSo in the BFS:\n\nWe are at state (t, y) and we have already ensured that (t,y) is safe (unless we are at 0 or 9). Then we choose an action a_t, which leads to:\n\nAt turn t, we are at y (which is safe) and then we move to y_{t+1} = y + delta, and then at turn t+1, we are at (t+1, y_{t+1}) and we must check that (t+1, y_{t+1}) is safe.\n\nBut note: we don't check the intermediate? The problem says: collision occurs at turn T only if we are on freeway y_T at turn T. So at turn t, we are at y_t, and we are safe at turn t. At turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}, and we check safety at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, when we generate the next state (t+1, y'), we must check that:\n\n- If y' is in [1,8], then we must check that at turn t+1, freeway y' is safe.\n\nIf safe, then we can go to that state.\n\nWe'll do BFS in terms of turns.\n\nWe start:\n\nState: (t=64, y=0, path=[]) -> safe because y=0.\n\nThen we consider:\n\na_t = U: then y_{65} = 1 -> check state (65,1): is freeway1 safe at turn65?\n\na_t = D: then y_{65}=0 -> state (65,0) -> safe.\na_t = S: then y_{65}=0 -> state (65,0) -> safe.\n\nBut we want minimal turns, so we prefer going up. However, we must avoid collisions.\n\nLet's compute for freeway1 at turn65:\n\ndt = 65-64 = 1\ncar on freeway1: (0,-47,'right',48)\n   right-moving: left_end = -47 + 48*1 = 1, right_end = 0 + 48*1 = 48 -> [1,48] -> does 0 fall in [1,48]? No. So safe.\n\nSo (65,1) is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for (65,0): safe.\n\nSo from (64,0), we can go to (65,1) by U, or (65,0) by D or S.\n\nWe want minimal H, so we try to go up first.\n\nWe'll use BFS (which is by increasing t).\n\nWe'll use a queue and mark visited states? However, we might come to the same (t,y) by different paths? But we are minimizing t? Actually, if we come to the same (t,y) by a different path, it's the same state. And we don't need to revisit because the future only depends on the current state.\n\nBut note: we might have different paths that lead to the same (t,y) and then the future is the same. So we can mark (t,y) as visited.\n\nBut note: the car positions are deterministic and depend only on t, not on the path. So the safety at (t,y) only depends on t and y.\n\nSo we can use a visited set: (t,y).\n\nWe start:\n\nLet Q = deque()\nWe start with (64,0, path=[])\n\nMark visited: set of (t,y)\n\nWe'll do:\n\nwhile Q:\n    pop state (t,y,path)\n    if y==9: we output the path (which has length = t-64) and break.\n\n    Else, we consider next actions at turn t: U, D, S.\n\n        For each action:\n            y_next = y + delta (with bounds)\n\n            t_next = t+1\n\n            If y_next is 0 or 9: safe.\n            Else (y_next in [1,8]): check freeway y_next at turn t_next (using the function above). \n\n            If safe and (t_next, y_next) not visited, then push (t_next, y_next, path + [action]) and mark visited.\n\nWe break when we find a path to y=9.\n\nWe are to output the sequence of actions for turns 64 to t-1? Actually, the path we have is the actions for turn64, turn65, ... until the last action at turn t-1 that got us to (t,9). But when we are at (t,y) and we see y==9, the path we have is the actions from turn64 to turn t-1. The number of actions is (t-64). And we are at turn t.\n\nSo we output:\n\nTurn 64: a_64 (the first action in the path)\n...\nTurn t-1: a_{t-1}\n\nNow, let's simulate until we get to y=9.\n\nWe'll code the safety check.\n\nBut we must be cautious: the freeways have multiple cars? Yes, freeway2 and 3 and 7 have two cars.\n\nWe'll code the safety function:\n\ndef is_safe(t, y):\n    if y==0 or y==9:\n        return True\n    dt = t - 64\n    cars_list = cars[y]   # list of cars on freeway y\n    for car in cars_list:\n        head, tail, d, s = car\n        if d == 'right':\n            left_end = tail + s * dt\n            right_end = head + s * dt\n            if left_end <= 0 <= right_end:\n                return False\n        elif d == 'left':\n            left_end = head - s * dt\n            right_end = tail - s * dt\n            if left_end <= 0 <= right_end:\n                return False\n    return True\n\nNow, let's run the BFS.\n\nWe'll do step by step for the first few turns to see if we can go straight up.\n\nWe start at (64,0)\n\nAt turn64: we can do U, D, S.\n\nWe try U: leads to (65,1). Check (65,1): freeway1.\n\nFreeway1: car (0,-47,right,48) -> dt=1: [ -47+48, 0+48] = [1,48] -> 0 not in [1,48] -> safe.\n\nSo we can go to (65,1) by U.\n\nSimilarly, D and S lead to (65,0) which is safe.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so we prefer the path that goes up.\n\nWe'll do BFS and we'll get the minimal t.\n\nWe'll simulate:\n\nLevel 0: t=64, y=0, path=[] -> not goal.\n\nLevel 1: t=65, y=0 (by D or S) and y=1 (by U).\n\nNow, from (65,1): we can do U -> (66,2), D->(66,0), S->(66,1)\n\nCheck (66,2): freeway2 at turn66.\n\ndt=66-64=2\n\nFreeway2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,12): \n   left_end = 49 + 12*2 = 49+24=73\n   right_end = 60+24=84 -> [73,84] -> 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12):\n   left_end = 1 + 24 = 25\n   right_end = 12+24=36 -> [25,36] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo (66,2) is safe.\n\nSimilarly, (66,0) is safe.\n\n(66,1): freeway1 at turn66: \n   car: (0,-47,right,48): \n        left_end = -47+48*2 = -47+96=49\n        right_end = 0+96=96 -> [49,96] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSo from (65,1) we can go to (66,2) by U, (66,0) by D, (66,1) by S.\n\nWe continue.\n\nWe are going to try to go straight up:\n\n(64,0) -> U -> (65,1) -> U -> (66,2) -> U -> (67,3)\n\nCheck (67,3): freeway3 at turn67.\n\ndt=3\n\nFreeway3: same as freeway2? \n   First car: (60,49,right,12): left=49+12*3=49+36=85, right=60+36=96 -> safe.\n   Second car: (12,1,right,12): left=1+36=37, right=12+36=48 -> safe.\n\nSo (67,3) safe.\n\nThen U to (68,4): freeway4 at turn68.\n\ndt=4\n\nFreeway4: (12,47,left,36): \n   left_end = 12 - 36*4 = 12-144 = -132\n   right_end = 47 - 144 = -97 -> [-132, -97] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nThen U to (69,5): freeway5 at turn69.\n\ndt=5\n\nFreeway5: same as freeway4? \n   left_end = 12 - 36*5 = 12-180 = -168\n   right_end = 47-180 = -133 -> safe.\n\nThen U to (70,6): freeway6 at turn70.\n\ndt=6\n\nFreeway6: (-42,-53,right,6): \n   left_end = -53 + 6*6 = -53+36 = -17\n   right_end = -42+36 = -6 -> [-17,-6] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nThen U to (71,7): freeway7 at turn71.\n\ndt=7\n\nFreeway7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (52,41,right,4): \n   left_end = 41 + 4*7 = 41+28=69, right_end=52+28=80 -> safe.\n\nSecond car: (4,-7,right,4): \n   left_end = -7 + 28 = 21, right_end=4+28=32 -> [21,32] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSo (71,7) safe.\n\nThen U to (72,8): freeway8 at turn72.\n\ndt=8\n\nFreeway8: (-45,-56,right,3): \n   left_end = -56 + 3*8 = -56+24 = -32\n   right_end = -45+24 = -21 -> [-32,-21] -> safe.\n\nThen U to (73,9): goal.\n\nSo we have a path: 9 consecutive U moves.\n\nThe sequence: \n   turn64: U\n   turn65: U\n   turn66: U\n   turn67: U\n   turn68: U\n   turn69: U\n   turn70: U\n   turn71: U\n   turn72: U\n\nThen at turn73, we are at y=9.\n\nThe number of actions: 9.\n\nBut let me double-check the freeways at the turns we are on:\n\nAt turn64: we are at y=0 -> safe.\nAt turn65: we are at y=1 -> freeway1 at turn65: [1,48] -> safe (0 not in).\nAt turn66: y=2 -> freeway2: [25,36] and [73,84] -> safe.\nAt turn67: y=3 -> freeway3: same as freeway2? [37,48] and [85,96] -> safe.\nAt turn68: y=4 -> freeway4: [-132,-97] -> safe.\nAt turn69: y=5 -> freeway5: same as freeway4? [-168,-133] -> safe.\nAt turn70: y=6 -> freeway6: [-17,-6] -> safe.\nAt turn71: y=7 -> freeway7: [21,32] and [69,80] -> safe.\nAt turn72: y=8 -> freeway8: [-32,-21] -> safe.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut wait: at turn71, we are at freeway7. The second car: at turn71, dt=7, second car: (4,-7,right,4): \n   left_end = -7 + 4*7 = -7+28=21, right_end=4+28=32 -> [21,32] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the minimal H is 9.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is 9 U's.\n\nOutput:\n\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: U\nTurn 66: U\nTurn 67: U\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: U\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn72, which moves us to y=9 at turn73.\n\nThe problem says: we are to output the actions for turns t1 (64) to ... until the last action. The actions are for turns 64,65,...,72.\n\nSo 9 actions.\n\nBut let me check if there is a path with H<9? Impossible because we need to go from 0 to 9, 9 steps.\n\nSo this is minimal.\n\nBut what about the car on freeway7 at turn64? It was covering 0? But we are not on freeway7 until turn71? And at turn71, the car has moved to [21,32]? So it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway1 at turn65: [1,48] -> safe.\n\nSo the answer is 9 U's.\n\nBut the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\"\n\nWe have H=9.\n\nNow, we write the answer.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: U\nTurn 66: U\nTurn 67: U\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: U\n}\n\nBut note: the last turn we take action is turn72, and then at turn73 we are at y=9.\n\nSo the sequence is for turns 64 to 72.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions for t from 0 to H-1, where H is the number of turns? Actually, the minimal number of turns H: but note the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" and the sequence is for t=0 to H-1? \n\nBut in the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nSo the actions are for t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAnd then we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\nSo H=9, then actions at turns 64,65,...,72 (which is 64+0 to 64+8, so t=0 to 8, which is 9 actions).\n\nYes.\n\nSo we output.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 64\\) is 9. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (\"U\") for all 9 turns, as this path avoids collisions with all cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Turn 64 (current)**: Player is at \\((0, 0)\\), which is not a freeway row.

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0,1) at turn t1 = 65. The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe car update rules: for each car, given its state at turn t1, I need to compute where it will be at future turns. Collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn.\n\nImportant note: when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So if at turn T, they move from y_T to y_{T+1}, at turn T they are still on y_T, and only on y_{T+1} starting turn T+1. So for collision, at turn T, we only care about cars on the current freeway y_T.\n\nThe player position updates: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy based on action U (+1), D (-1), or S (0). y must stay within 0 to 9.\n\nNow, the car states are given for turn t1=65. For each freeway k from 1 to 8, there are cars listed with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right-moving means the car is moving to the right, so position increases with time. Left-moving means position decreases.\n\nFor a right-moving car: at turn T, span is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]? Let me read carefully.\n\nThe update: for left-moving, span at T is [h - s(T - t1), τ - s(T - t1)]. Head and tail: for left-moving, it says \"head at h, tail at τ\", and span is [h, τ] at t1, then at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \"head at h, tail at τ\", span at t1 is [τ, h]? No, it says: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving? Let's see.\n\nIt says: for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)].\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (48,1,right,48) — so head=48, tail=1? But for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], so if head is larger, τ should be smaller. In this case, head=48, tail=1, so τ=1, h=48, so [1,48] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 4: (-24,11,left,36), head=-24, tail=11? But head should be the front, so for left-moving, if it's moving left, head should be smaller than tail? Let's clarify.\n\nThe notation: it says \"head at h, tail at τ\" and for left-moving, span is [h, τ] at t1, meaning from h to τ, with h being the head position.\n\nIn freeway 4: head h=-24, tail τ=11, direction left, so at t1, span is [h, τ] = [-24,11]. Since it's left-moving, positions decrease, so head is at left, tail at right? But -24 to 11, that's increasing, but direction left? This might be inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps I misread. For left-moving, it says: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nSo with h and τ, and since it's moving left, the positions decrease.\n\nIn freeway 4: h=-24, τ=11, so at t1, positions from -24 to 11. But since it's moving left, at later times, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn freeway 1: (48,1,right,48), so τ=1? Head is 48, tail is 1, so for right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [1,48] at t1.\n\nThe notation says \"head h, tail τ\", but in the span, for right-moving, it's [τ, h], which might imply τ is left end, h is right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h left end, τ right end? In freeway 4, h=-24, τ=11, so h < τ, so left end h, right end τ.\n\nThen moving left, both decrease.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, player is on freeway y_T, and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nPlayer is on y_T at turn T, meaning when we check collision at turn T, it's for the freeway they are currently on at that turn.\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,1) at turn 65, so at turn 65, they are on y=1.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H, so probably want to go up as fast as possible, but avoiding cars.\n\ny from 0 to 9, player at (0,y), so vertical position.\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, no cars mentioned, so probably no collision there.\n\nGoal is (0,9), so once at y=9, we stop.\n\nNow, let's list all cars for each freeway at turn t1=65.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (head=48, tail=1, direction=right, speed=48). Since right-moving, span at t1: [τ, h] = [1,48]? τ=tail=1, h=head=48, so [1,48].\n\nBut tail and head: for right-moving, tail is left end, head is right end, so [tail, head] = [1,48].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head=-48, tail=-59? That seems odd. head=-48, tail=-59, direction right.\n\nSince right-moving, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? τ=tail=-59, h=head=-48, so [-59, -48].\n\nSimilarly, second car: (24,13,right,12), head=24, tail=13, so [τ,h] = [13,24].\n\nBut tail=13, head=24, so [13,24].\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2: (-48,-59,right,12) and (24,13,right,12), so [-59,-48] and [13,24].\n\nFreeway 4: (-24,11,left,36) — head=-24, tail=11, direction left, so at t1 span [h,τ] = [-24,11].\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4: (-24,11,left,36), so [-24,11].\n\nFreeway 6: (-36,-47,right,6) — head=-36, tail=-47, direction right, so [τ,h] = [-47,-36].\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (56,45,right,4) and (8,-3,right,4)\n\nFirst: head=56, tail=45, right, so [τ,h] = [45,56]\n\nSecond: head=8, tail=-3, right, so [τ,h] = [-3,8]\n\nFreeway 8: (-42,-53,right,3) — head=-42, tail=-53, right, so [τ,h] = [-53,-42]\n\nNow, for each freeway and each future turn T, I need to find if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nT is relative to t1, so let τ = T - t1, the number of turns after t1.\n\nAt turn T = t1 + τ, the span for a car depends on τ.\n\nFor a right-moving car with initial span [τ_init, h_init] at t1, at time T, span is [τ_init + s * τ, h_init + s * τ]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: initial [h_init, τ_init], at T, [h_init - s * τ, τ_init - s * τ]\n\nThen collision on freeway k at turn T if there exists a car on k such that 0 is in [low, high] of the span at T.\n\nPlayer is on y_k at turn T only if y_T = k.\n\nNow, player starts at y=1 at turn 65.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1, 0, or +1, but y clamped to 0-9.\n\nSince we start at y=1 and want y=9, minimal H is at least 8 turns if we go up every time, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more.\n\nBut we should try to go up as much as possible.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and for various τ, whether position 0 is occupied at that turn.\n\nτ = T - t1, and T is the turn number.\n\nSince cars move, and we care about when 0 is covered.\n\nLet me define for each freeway k, the times when it is unsafe, meaning some car covers 0.\n\nThen, for the player to be on y at turn T, if y=k, and k is unsafe at T, collision.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nPlayer position: at turn T, y_T depends on actions from t1 to T.\n\nStart at turn 65, y=1.\n\nActions a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, and after H actions, y_{t1+H} should be 9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t1, position is given, after action a_{t1}, we move to y_{t1+1}, and so on, up to after H actions, at turn t1+H, y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nThe sequence of turns: turn t1: we are at (0, y_{t1}) = (0,1), and we choose action a_{t1}, which determines y_{t1+1}.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}, choose a_{t1+1}, and so on, until at some turn t1 + H, y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, so t from 0 to H-1, actions a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, at turn t1 + H, position is y_{t1+H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at turn t1 + H -1, leading to y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nFor example, at turn t1, we take action a_{t1}, go to y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n\nAt turn t1+H-1, take action, go to y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nThe turns we care about for position are turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H, but at turn t1, we are at y=1, and we start by taking action, so for collision, we need to avoid collision at each turn from t1 to t1+H-1? Let's see.\n\nAt each turn T, from t1 to t1+H-1, we are at position y_T, and we take action a_T, which may change y for the next turn.\n\nBut at turn T, we are on y_T, and we check collision for that turn on freeway y_T.\n\nThen after action, at turn T+1, we are on y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nAt turn t1+H, we are at y=9, and since y=9 has no cars, it's safe, and we don't take action after that, so we only care about turns from t1 to t1+H-1 for collision, because at t1+H, we are at y=9, no action, no collision check needed I think.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" and \"avoid collisions with cars\", and collision occurs at turn T only if on freeway y_T and 0 in car span.\n\nSo for the path, we need that for all T from t1 to t1+H-1, at turn T, on freeway y_T, it is safe, i.e., no car on that freeway covers 0 at T.\n\nAnd at turn t1+H, we are at y=9, which is safe.\n\nSo we need to find actions such that y_{t1+H} =9, and for all τ from 0 to H-1, at turn t1+τ, y_{t1+τ} is safe.\n\nτ from 0 to H-1: turn t1+τ, position y_{t1+τ}, must be safe at that turn.\n\nWith y_{t1} =1 given.\n\ny_{t1+τ} for τ=0 to H, but for τ=H, y_{t1+H}=9, safe, no collision check needed since no action or something, but to be precise, collision is only when on freeway with cars, y=1 to 8, so at y=9, no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly y=0, but we start from y=1, going to y=9, so y=0 might be visited if we go down.\n\nBut y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nNow, back to the cars.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway k, the times when it is unsafe.\n\nFor freeway k, at turn T, unsafe if 0 is in some car's span on k at T.\n\nT = t1 + τ, τ >=0.\n\nBut t1=65, so T = 65 + τ.\n\nSince the span depends on τ, I can work with τ.\n\nLet me compute for each car, when 0 is in its span.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, right-moving, initial at τ=0: span [1,48], speed 48.\n\nAt time τ, span [1 + 48τ, 48 + 48τ]\n\n0 in span if 1 + 48τ <= 0 <= 48 + 48τ\n\nSince 48τ >0 for τ>0, 1+48τ >1>0 for τ>=0, so 0 < 1+48τ <= left end, so 0 is never in [1+48τ, 48+48τ] because left end is at least 1, so 0 not covered. So freeway 1 is always safe? At τ=0, span [1,48], 0 not in [1,48], so yes, 0 never covered on freeway 1. So freeway 1 is always safe.\n\nIs that right? Left end 1+48τ >=1 >0, so 0 is always left of the car, never covered. Yes.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12), initial span [τ,h] = [-59,-48] since tail=-59, head=-48.\n\nAt τ, span [-59 + 12τ, -48 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span if -59 +12τ <= 0 <= -48 +12τ\n\nWhich is -59 +12τ <= 0 and 0 <= -48 +12τ\n\nSo 12τ <= 59 and 12τ >=48\n\nτ <= 59/12 = 4.916, so τ <=4 since integer? τ integer, turns.\n\nτ is number of steps, integer.\n\nSo 12τ <=59, τ <= floor(59/12)=4 since 12*4=48<59, 12*5=60>59.\n\n12τ <=59, τ <=4 because 12*4=48<=59, 12*5=60>59.\n\nAnd 12τ >=48, so τ >=4.\n\n12τ >=48, τ >=4.\n\nAnd τ <=4 from above? 12τ <=59, τ <=4.916, so τ <=4.\n\nτ >=4 and τ <=4, so τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, span: -59 +12*4 = -59+48= -11, and -48+48=0? -48 +12*4= -48+48=0.\n\nSo [ -11, 0 ], so 0 is covered, since 0 <=0 <=0, yes.\n\nAt τ=4, left end -11, right end 0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included.\n\nFor other τ, not covered.\n\nSecond car on freeway 2: (24,13,right,12), initial [13,24]\n\nAt τ, [13+12τ, 24+12τ]\n\n0 in? 13+12τ <=0 <=24+12τ?

Let's define.\n\nAt turn T=t1+τ, position y_τ.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=1\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at τ=1, y_{t1+1} = y_0 + Δy\n\nGenerally, at turn t1+τ, position y_τ.\n\nThen after action, y_{τ+1} = y_τ + a_τ, with a_τ = U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\nAnd y_τ between 0 and 9.\n\nWe want for some H, at τ=H, y_H =9.\n\nAnd for all τ from 0 to H-1, at turn t1+τ, position y_τ is safe, meaning freeway y_τ is safe at time τ.\n\ny_τ is the freeway number at time τ.\n\nFor example, if we always go up, starting y_0=1\n\nτ=0: y=1, freeway 1 safe\n\na=U, y_1=2\n\nτ=1: y=2, freeway 2 at τ=1: unsafe only at τ=4, so at τ=1, safe.\n\na=U, y_2=3\n\nτ=2: y=3, freeway 3 unsafe only at τ=4, so at τ=2, safe.\n\na=U, y_3=4\n\nτ=3: y=4, freeway 4 unsafe only at τ=0, so at τ=3, safe? τ=0 is initial, τ=3 different.\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe at τ=0 only, so for τ=3, safe.\n\na=U, y_4=5\n\nτ=4: y=5, freeway 5 unsafe at τ=0 only, so at τ=4, safe.\n\na=U, y_5=6\n\nτ=5: y=6, freeway 6 unsafe at τ=6 and 7, τ=5 not unsafe, so safe.\n\na=U, y_6=7\n\nτ=6: y=7, freeway 7 unsafe at τ=0 only, so at τ=6, safe.\n\na=U, y_7=8\n\nτ=7: y=8, freeway 8 unsafe at τ=14 to 17, τ=7 not in, safe.\n\na=U, y_8=9\n\nNow at τ=8, y=9, reached.\n\nAnd we never were on unsafe freeway at wrong time.\n\nIn this path, at τ=4, y=5, which is safe since freeway 5 only unsafe at τ=0.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nH=8 turns? Let's see the turns.\n\nStart at τ=0, turn t1, y=1, safe.\n\nAction U, go to y=2 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, turn t1+1, y=2, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=3, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=4 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=4, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=5 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=5, freeway 5 safe at τ=4.\n\nAction U, to y=6 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, y=6, freeway 6 unsafe at τ=6,7, not τ=5, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=7 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, y=7, freeway 7 unsafe only at τ=0, so safe at τ=6.\n\nAction U, to y=8 at τ=7.\n\nAt τ=7, y=8, freeway 8 unsafe from τ=14, not τ=7, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=9 at τ=8.\n\nNow at τ=8, y=9, goal.\n\nWe took actions at τ=0 to τ=7, 8 actions, reached y=9 at τ=8.\n\nIn terms of turn: actions at t1 to t1+7, and position at t1+8 is (0,9).\n\nThe sequence: for each turn from t1 to t1+7, actions U.\n\nBut let's confirm if at any point unsafe.\n\nSpecifically, at τ=4, we are on y=5, freeway 5 unsafe only at τ=0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 and 3 unsafe at τ=4, but at τ=4, if we were on y=2 or 3, it would be unsafe, but in this path, at τ=4, we are on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 unsafe at τ=6,7; at τ=6 we are on y=7, not y=6; at τ=7 on y=8, not y=6.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe later.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut freeway 7 unsafe at τ=0, but we are on y=1 at τ=0, not y=7.\n\nIn this path, we are never on an unsafe freeway at the critical times.\n\nMoreover, we reached in 8 steps, which is minimal possible since from y=1 to y=9, need 8 up moves.\n\nBut is there any constraint that might force us to wait? In this case, no, we can go straight up.\n\nBut let's double-check freeway 5 at τ=4: freeway 5 has car, unsafe only at τ=0, so at τ=4, car position: for freeway 5, same as freeway 4, left-moving, speed 36.\n\nAt τ=4, span: [ -24 -36*4, 11 -36*4 ] = [-24-144, 11-144] = [-168, -133], far left, 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 at τ=5: car right-moving, at τ=5, span [ -47 +6*5, -36 +6*5] = [-47+30, -36+30] = [-17,-6], not cover 0.\n\nAt τ=6, if on y=6, unsafe, but we are on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nSo minimal H=8.\n\nActions: all U for 8 steps.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1} = U\n\nTurn t1+1: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t1+7: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn t1+8, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from turn t1 to t1+7.\n\nH=8 actions.\n\nIn the boxed answer, it should list the actions.\n\nBut t1=65, but we use t1 in the answer.\n\nThe format: Turn t1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nSo for this, it should be:\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\n...\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nt1+7=65+7=72.\n\nt1=65, actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+7, which is 65 to 72.\n\nThen position at 73 is y=9.\n\nBut we need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, since all U, it's fine.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nFreeway 4 and 5 are unsafe at τ=0, but we start at y=1, so no problem.\n\nIn the path, we go through y=4 at τ=3, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 2 and 3 unsafe at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, if on y=2 or 3, unsafe.\n\nBut in our path, at τ=4, we are on y=5.\n\nτ=4: turn t1+4=69.\n\nAt that turn, if y=2 or 3, collision.\n\nBut we are at y=5.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster, but 8 is minimal.\n\nUnless we can skip, but no, must move step by step.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nBut in the car list, freeway 7 has two cars, but we only care about when 0 covered.\n\nIn our case, at τ=6, on y=7, freeway 7 unsafe only at τ=0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is 8 Up actions.\n\nBut the answer format should list each turn.\n\nSince all same, we can write.\n\nBut let's see the problem: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH=8.\n\nSequence: a_{65} to a_{72} all U.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut perhaps we need to write it out.\n\nSince the question says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., we can write with t1.\n\nIn the answer, it should be with numbers or symbols?\n\nThe format says: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nBut in the box, probably with the value.\n\nSince t1 given as 65, use numbers.\n\nIn the response, we can write.\n\nBut in the reasoning, I think it's correct.\n\nAnother thing: at y=0 and y=9, safe, but we didn't go there.\n\nIn this path, we start from y=1, go up to 9, no down or stay.\n\nIs there a reason to go down? For example, to avoid something, but in this case, not necessary.\n\nSuppose at some point we need to wait, but here no need.\n\nFor example, if we were to be on y=6 at τ=6 or 7, it would be unsafe, but we are not.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think H=8 is achievable.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 8.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nAfter action at 72, position at 73 is y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t1 to t1+H-1, H=8, so t1 to t1+7.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let's write the box.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 65: U \\\\\nTurn 66: U \\\\\nTurn 67: U \\\\\nTurn 68: U \\\\\nTurn 69: U \\\\\nTurn 70: U \\\\\nTurn 71: U \\\\\nTurn 72: U\n}\n\nBut the turn numbers: t1=65, so Turn 65, etc.\n\nSince the question says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\", but in box, with numbers.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nAnother thing: the player update, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy based on action at t.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nIn terms of time, at turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nIn this case, from t=65 to t=72, actions, and at t=73, y=9.\n\nBut for collision, from t=65 to t=72, we need safe at those turns.\n\nt=65: τ=0, y=1 safe\n\nt=66: τ=1, y=2 safe (freeway 2 unsafe only at τ=4)\n\n...\n\nt=69: τ=4, y=5 safe\n\nt=70: τ=5, y=6 safe (freeway 6 unsafe at τ=6,7)\n\nt=71: τ=6, y=7 safe\n\nt=72: τ=7, y=8 safe\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 65\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Positions and Safe Times\nThe car states at turn \\(t_1 = 65\\) are given, and their positions at future turns \\(T = t_1 + \\tau\\) (where \\(\\tau \\geq 0\\)) are computed using the car update rules. A freeway \\(k\\) is unsafe at turn \\(T\\) if position 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at \\(T\\). The player avoids collision by not being on an unsafe freeway at the corresponding turn.\n\n- **Freeway 1**: Always safe (no car covers position 0 at any \\(\\tau\\)).\n- **Freeway 2**: Unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 4\\) (turn \\(T = 69\\)).\n- **Freeway 3**: Unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 4\\) (turn \\(T = 69\\)).\n- **Freeway 4**: Unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn \\(T = 65\\)).\n- **Freeway 5**: Unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn \\(T = 65\\)).\n- **Freeway 6**: Unsafe at \\(\\tau = 6\\) and \\(\\tau = 7\\) (turns \\(T = 71\\) and \\(T = 72\\)).\n- **Freeway 7**: Unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn \\(T = 65\\)).\n- **Freeway 8**: Unsafe from \\(\\tau = 14\\) to \\(\\tau = 17\\) (turns \\(T = 79\\) to \\(T = 82\\)).\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) Minimally\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 1\\) is 8, achieved by moving up (U) at every turn. This path avoids all unsafe conditions:\n- At turn \\(T = 65\\) (\\(\\tau = 0\\)), \\(y = 1\\) (Freeway 1, safe).\n- At turn \\(T = 66\\) (\\(\\tau = 1\\)), \\(y = 2\\) (Freeway 2, safe since unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 4\\)).\n- At turn \\(T = 67\\) (\\(\\tau = 2\\)), \\(y = 3\\) (Freeway 3, safe since unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 4\\)).\n- At turn \\(T = 68\\) (\\(\\tau = 3\\)), \\(y = 4\\) (Freeway 4, safe since unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 0\\)).\n- At turn \\(T = 69\\) (\\(\\tau = 4\\)), \\(y = 5\\) (Freeway 5, safe since unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 0\\); Freeways 2 and 3 are unsafe at this turn, but player is on \\(y = 5\\)).\n- At turn \\(T = 70\\) (\\(\\tau = 5\\)), \\(y = 6\\) (Freeway 6, safe since unsafe at \\(\\tau = 6\\) and \\(7\\), not \\(\\tau = 5\\)).\n- At turn \\(T = 71\\) (\\(\\tau = 6\\)), \\(y = 7\\) (Freeway 7, safe since unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 0\\); Freeway 6 is unsafe at this turn, but player is on \\(y = 7\\)).\n- At turn \\(T = 72\\) (\\(\\tau = 7\\)), \\(y = 8\\) (Freeway 8, safe since unsafe from \\(\\tau = 14\\) to \\(17\\), not \\(\\tau = 7\\); Freeway 6 is unsafe at this turn, but player is on \\(y = 8\\)).\n- After the action at \\(T = 72\\), the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(T = 73\\), which is safe (no cars on \\(y = 9\\)).\n\nThus, the sequence of 8 up actions (U) from turn 65 to turn 72 achieves the goal in minimal turns without collisions.\n\n### Sequence of Actions\nThe actions are for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 65\\) to \\(72\\), resulting in \\(y = 9\\) at turn 73.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 65: U \\\\\nTurn 66: U \\\\\nTurn 67: U \\\\\nTurn 68: U \\\\\nTurn 69: U \\\\\nTurn 70: U \\\\\nTurn 71: U \\\\\nTurn 72: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 66, and the player is at (0,2). The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to y=8). \n\nImportant note: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8) and at that same turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nAlso note: When the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T the player is still on y_T. So at turn T, we check for collision only on the current freeway y_T. Then at the next turn (T+1) the player will be on y_{T+1}.\n\nWe start at turn 66 at y=2. We need to get to y=9. Since the grid is from y=0 to y=9, and we start at 2, we must go up to 9.\n\nThe moves: U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay: y remains). We cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nThe challenge is to avoid the cars on the freeways (y=1 to y=8) at the exact turns we are on those freeways.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=66. For each freeway (k=1 to 8), there are one or more cars. Each car is defined by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note that the representation of the span is different for left and right moving cars.\n\nFor a left-moving car (d='left'): \n  At time t1: span is [h, τ] (with h >= τ) and then at time T, the span becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\nFor a right-moving car (d='right'):\n  At time t1: span is [τ, h] (so τ is the leftmost and h the rightmost) and at time T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nCollision: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (so y_T = k) and at that turn, there exists a car on freeway k such that 0 is in the car's span at T.\n\nWe must compute for each freeway k (that we might step on) and for the time steps we are on that freeway, whether 0 is in any car's span on that freeway at that exact turn.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H (number of turns) and a sequence of actions (starting at turn 66) that gets us to y=9 at turn 66+H-1.\n\nSince we start at y=2 and we need to get to y=9, we must go up at least 7 times. But we can also go down or stay, so the minimal H without any obstacles would be 7 (if we go up 7 times). However, we must avoid the cars.\n\nWe have to check for each freeway from y=3 to y=8 (since we start at y=2 and we are going up, and we are at y=2 at turn 66) and also note we might step on y=1 if we go down? But we are starting at 2 and going to 9, so we should only be moving up. However, sometimes going down might help avoid a car? But note that going down from 2 would take us to 1, and then we have to go up again, which would take more turns. Since we are minimizing the number of turns, we should avoid unnecessary moves. So we will try to go up as much as possible, but if we cannot because of a car, we might have to wait (stay) or even go down to avoid and then come back up.\n\nBut note: we start at y=2 at turn 66. We are going to plan for the next turns.\n\nWe must consider the state at each turn. We are going to simulate the player's moves and check for collisions.\n\nLet me denote the turn relative to t1: \n  t = 0 corresponds to turn 66 (current turn)\n  t = 1 corresponds to turn 67, etc.\n\nWe are at (0,2) at t=0 (turn 66). We are about to take an action at turn 66 (which will determine y at t=1) and so on.\n\nImportant: at turn T (absolute) = 66 + t (relative), the player's y position is the result after the action at the previous turn? Actually, the update rule:\n\nAt turn t (absolute), we take action a_t, then we update to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at the start of turn 66 (t1=66), the player is at (0,2). Then we take action a_66. Then at the end of turn 66 (or start of turn 67) we are at y_{67} = y_66 + Δy_66.\n\nBut note: during turn 66, we are at y=2. So we must check for collision at turn 66? \n\nThe problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAt turn 66, we are at y_66 = 2. So we are on freeway 2? But note: the freeways are y=1 to y=8. So y=2 is freeway 2.\n\nTherefore, at turn 66, we must check for collision on freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, at each turn T (absolute) we are at y_T, and we must check the cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSo we start at turn 66 at y=2. We are given the car state at turn 66. We must check for collision at turn 66 on freeway 2.\n\nLet's compute the car spans at turn 66 for freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 has two cars: \n  Car1: (-36, -47, right, 12)\n  Car2: (36, 25, right, 12)\n\nFor right-moving cars, at time T, the span is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nAt T = 66 (which is t1, so T-t1=0):\n  Car1: [ -47 + 12*0, -36 + 12*0] = [-47, -36]\n  Car2: [ 25 + 0, 36 + 0] = [25, 36]\n\nIs 0 in [-47,-36]? -> No, because -47<=0<=-36? 0 is not between -47 and -36 (it's greater than -36). Similarly, 0 is not in [25,36]. So at turn 66, no collision on freeway 2.\n\nNow, we are safe at turn 66.\n\nWe then take an action at turn 66 (a_66) which will lead to y_67 = y_66 + Δy_66.\n\nWe must then check at turn 67: we are at y_67, and we must check the cars on that freeway at turn 67 (absolute 67).\n\nSimilarly for subsequent turns.\n\nOur goal is to have y_{66+H-1} = 9. That is, after H-1 actions (from turn 66 to turn 66+H-2) we will be at y=9 at the start of turn 66+H-1? Actually, let me clarify:\n\nAfter turn 66 (action a_66) we are at y_67 at turn 67.\nAfter turn 67 (action a_67) we are at y_68 at turn 68.\n...\nAfter turn (66+H-2) (action a_{66+H-2}) we are at y_{66+H-1} at turn (66+H-1). We want y_{66+H-1} to be 9.\n\nSo we need H-1 actions to go from turn 66 to turn 66+H-2, and then at the next turn (turn 66+H-1) we are at position (0,9). But note that at turn 66+H-1 we are at y=9, which is the goal and is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8, so 9 is safe). So we don't need to check for collision at the goal.\n\nTherefore, we need to get to y=9 in as few actions as possible.\n\nWe are going to simulate the moves and check for collisions on the freeways we step on.\n\nWe'll try to find the minimal H by trying to go up as fast as possible (H=7) and see if it's possible. If not, we try H=8, etc.\n\nBut note: we might have to wait or go down to avoid a car, so H might be more than 7.\n\nLet me list the freeways we care about: we start at 2 and we need to go to 9, so we will pass through y=3,4,5,6,7,8. We might also step on y=1 if we go down, but we'll avoid that if possible.\n\nWe'll compute for each freeway k and for each time step (relative to t1=66) the car spans and see if 0 is in any car's span.\n\nBut note: the time step we care about is the absolute turn: T = 66 + t, where t is the number of steps after the initial turn (so t=0 for turn 66, t=1 for turn 67, etc.)\n\nWe are going to simulate the player's path.\n\nWe'll do a BFS or Dijkstra? Since we are minimizing the number of turns, and each action costs one turn, we can do BFS by time. The state is (y, t) where t is the relative time (0,1,2,...) and y is the current y position.\n\nBut note: the car positions change with absolute time, so we can compute the car spans for each freeway at each absolute time.\n\nWe start at (y=2, t=0) (relative time 0, absolute turn 66).\n\nWe have three actions: U, D, S.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nWe'll generate states and check for collisions at the current state.\n\nAt a state (y, t) (meaning at absolute turn 66+t, the player is at y), we must have that at that turn (66+t) we are safe: if y is between 1 and 8, then we must check that no car on freeway y has 0 in its span at absolute time 66+t.\n\nIf y is 0 or 9, then no collision check (since 0 and 9 are not freeways).\n\nWe start at (2,0) and we know that at t=0 (absolute 66) we are safe.\n\nThen we take an action to go to (y', t+1) at absolute turn 67+t? Actually, after taking an action at time t (relative) (which is absolute turn 66+t), we move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and that position is at the next turn (absolute 66+t+1).\n\nSo the next state is (y', t+1) and then we check collision at absolute turn 66+t+1.\n\nWe'll do a BFS starting from (2,0). We want to reach y=9 at any time t (relative). The cost is t (the number of turns passed, but note: we start at t=0 and we haven't taken any action yet). We will take actions at each step.\n\nActually, at the initial state (2,0) we are at the beginning of turn 66. We then take an action a_66, and then at the next state (y1,1) we are at the beginning of turn 67. We must check collision at the beginning of each turn? Actually, the collision condition is for the entire turn: at turn T, if the player is on a freeway and 0 is in a car's span at that turn.\n\nSo for state (y,t) (relative time t, absolute turn 66+t), we are at that position at the start of the turn? Actually, the problem doesn't specify the exact timing, but it says \"at turn T\". So we assume that during the entire turn T, the player is at y_T and the cars are at their spans for that turn. So we check at each absolute turn T (66+t) for the state (y,t).\n\nTherefore, when we are in a state (y,t) (relative time t, absolute turn 66+t), we must check if we are safe: if y is in [1,8], then we must ensure that 0 is not in any car's span on freeway y at absolute time 66+t.\n\nIf we are safe, then we can take actions to the next state.\n\nWe start at (2,0) and we are safe (as we checked).\n\nThen we take an action (U, D, or S) and that leads to a new state (y', t+1) at absolute turn 66+t+1. Then we check safety at (y', t+1).\n\nWe want to get to a state with y=9 at any t.\n\nWe'll use BFS (by time) to find the minimal t such that we can get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal time (in terms of relative time) will be H-1? Let me clarify:\n\nWe are at turn 66 (t=0) at y=2. We take H-1 actions: at turn 66, 67, ..., 66+H-2. Then at the start of turn 66+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nSo the relative time when we are at y=9 is t = H-1. So we want to minimize H, which is the number of turns from start until we are at y=9. Therefore, we are looking for the minimal t (relative) such that we are at y=9 and the path to there is safe.\n\nWe'll search until we find a state (9, t) for some t.\n\nWe'll keep track of the actions taken.\n\nBut note: the state space is small: y from 0 to 9, and t can be up to ... well, we don't know, but we can set a limit. Since without obstacles we can do it in 7 steps, and with obstacles we might need to wait, so we can set a limit, say 20 steps.\n\nNow, we need to precompute for each freeway k (1-8) and for each absolute time T (starting at 66 and going up) the set of car spans and whether 0 is covered by any car.\n\nBut note: the absolute time T can be large, but we are only going to simulate for t up to 20, so T from 66 to 86.\n\nWe'll precompute for each freeway k and for each absolute time T from 66 to 86 (or more if needed) whether there is a car on freeway k at time T that covers 0.\n\nLet me define a function is_safe(y, T) for y in [1,8] and T in [66, ...]:\n  For each car on freeway y (at time T), compute its span at time T and check if 0 is in that span.\n\nBut note: the car state is given at time t1=66. So we can compute the span for any T.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway the list of cars and then for a given T, compute the span for each car.\n\nWe'll do:\n\nFor freeway k, for each car (head, tail, direction, speed) at T0=66:\n\n  Let delta = T - 66.\n\n  If direction is 'right':\n      left_end = tail + speed * delta\n      right_end = head + speed * delta\n      Then the span is [left_end, right_end] (and we require left_end <= right_end).\n\n  If direction is 'left':\n      left_end = head - speed * delta\n      right_end = tail - speed * delta\n      But note: the initial representation for left-moving: at T0, span is [h, τ] meaning from h (rightmost) to τ (leftmost) and h>=τ. Then at T, it becomes [h - s*delta, τ - s*delta]. But note that since the car is moving left, the entire span shifts left. And the left_end would be τ - s*delta and the right_end would be h - s*delta? Actually, the problem says: left-moving: span at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. And since h>=τ, then h - s*delta >= τ - s*delta. So the span is [τ - s*delta, h - s*delta]? But the problem writes it as [h - s*delta, τ - s*delta] and then says that for left-moving the head is at h and tail at τ. But note: in the initial state for left-moving: \"head\" is the right end and \"tail\" is the left end? Actually, the problem states: for left-moving, the initial span is [h, τ] and then moves to [h-s*delta, τ-s*delta]. But [h, τ] with h>=τ would be a span that goes from τ to h? Actually, the notation [h, τ] with h>=τ doesn't make sense as an interval? Typically we write [min, max]. \n\nLet me re-read: \n  Left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then becomes [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\n\nBut if h and τ are such that h>=τ, then the interval [h, τ] would be empty? That doesn't make sense.\n\nLooking back: \n  For left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then the update. But note the example: freeway 4 and 5 have (-60,-25,left,36). At t1, the span is [-60, -25]? But then that would be from -60 to -25? But the problem writes it as (head, tail) = (-60, -25). So head=-60, tail=-25. Then if we write the span as [head, tail] = [-60, -25]? That would be the interval from -60 to -25, which is correct? But note: for a left-moving car, the head is the front? Then when moving left, the head is at the leftmost? Actually, the problem says: for left-moving: the car span becomes [h - s*delta, τ - s*delta]. And if the car is moving left, then the entire car shifts left by s*delta per turn.\n\nBut the initial span: [h, τ] at t1. In the example: h=-60, τ=-25. Then the initial span is [-60, -25]? But that is an interval of 35 units? And then at time T, it becomes [-60 - 36*(T-66), -25 - 36*(T-66)].\n\nBut note: the representation for the right-moving cars: (head, tail) = (96,49) for freeway1: that car is right-moving, and the span at t1 is [49,96]? But the problem says: for right-moving, the span is [τ, h] at t1. So τ is the left end, h the right end. So for freeway1: τ=49, h=96? But the input says (96,49) for head and tail. So in the input, the order is (head, tail) but for right-moving, the head is the right end and the tail is the left end? And for left-moving, the head is the left end and the tail is the right end? \n\nActually, the problem states for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then the update. And for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\". \n\nIn the input for freeway1: (96,49,right,48): so head=96, tail=49. Then for right-moving, the span at t1 is [τ, h] = [49,96]. That makes sense.\n\nFor freeway4: (-60,-25,left,36): so head=-60, tail=-25. Then for left-moving, the span at t1 is [h, τ] = [-60, -25]. But note: -60 < -25, so the interval is from -60 to -25. When the car moves left, the entire interval shifts left. So at time T, it becomes [ -60 - 36*(T-66), -25 - 36*(T-66) ].\n\nSo in general, for a car (head, tail, d, s):\n\n  If d == 'right':\n      left_end = tail + s * (T - 66)\n      right_end = head + s * (T - 66)\n      span = [left_end, right_end]\n\n  If d == 'left':\n      left_end = head - s * (T - 66)\n      right_end = tail - s * (T - 66)\n      span = [left_end, right_end]   # and note: since head <= tail? Actually in the example head=-60, tail=-25, so head < tail. So the interval is [head - s*delta, tail - s*delta] and since head <= tail, the interval is valid.\n\nBut wait: in the input for left-moving, we have head=-60 and tail=-25, which is head < tail. So the initial span is [head, tail] = [-60, -25]. But when we compute the new left_end = head - s*delta = -60 - 36*delta, and right_end = tail - s*delta = -25 - 36*delta, so the new span is [-60-36*delta, -25-36*delta]. This is correct: the car moves left, so both ends decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: head=96, tail=49: then left_end = 49 + 48*delta, right_end = 96+48*delta.\n\nBut note: in the input for freeway2: two cars: (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12). \n\nFor the first car: head=-36, tail=-47? Then for right-moving, the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-47, -36]. Then at time T, it becomes [-47 + 12*(T-66), -36 + 12*(T-66)].\n\nSimilarly, the second car: head=36, tail=25 -> span at t1: [25,36].\n\nNow, we can precompute for each freeway k and for T from 66 to 86, whether 0 is covered by any car on that freeway at time T.\n\nWe'll make a 2D array: safe[k][T] for k=1..8 and T=66..86 (or more) that is True if at freeway k and time T, there is NO car that covers 0, else False.\n\nBut note: if there is at least one car that covers 0 at time T on freeway k, then it is unsafe.\n\nSo we do:\n\nfor k in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]:\n  for T in range(66, 87): # 87 is exclusive, so up to 86\n      safe[k][T] = True   # initially safe\n      for each car on freeway k:\n          compute the span at T\n          if 0 is in [left_end, right_end] (inclusive), then safe[k][T] = False and break\n\nWe then use this in the BFS.\n\nLet me compute the spans for each freeway at a given T.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (96,49,right,48)\n  left_end = 49 + 48*(T-66)\n  right_end = 96 + 48*(T-66)\n  Check if 0 in [49+48*(T-66), 96+48*(T-66)]\n\n  Since 49+48*(T-66) is at least 49 (when T=66) and increases, it will always be >=49>0. So 0 is never in this interval. So freeway 1 is always safe.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars: \n  Car1: (-36,-47,right,12) -> [ -47 + 12*(T-66), -36 + 12*(T-66) ]\n  Car2: (36,25,right,12) -> [25+12*(T-66), 36+12*(T-66)]\n\n  For Car1: \n      We need: -47 + 12*(T-66) <= 0 <= -36 + 12*(T-66)\n      Solve: \n        -47 + 12*(T-66) <= 0  => 12*(T-66) <= 47 => T-66 <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916 => T <= 66+3.916 => T<=69.916 -> T<=69\n        and 0 <= -36 + 12*(T-66) => 12*(T-66) >= 36 => T-66 >= 3 => T>=69\n      So T must be 69? \n        At T=69: \n          left_end = -47 + 12*3 = -47+36 = -11\n          right_end = -36 + 36 = 0\n          So the span is [-11,0]. 0 is included? Yes, because it's the right endpoint.\n      So at T=69, Car1 covers 0.\n\n      Also at T=70: \n          left_end = -47+12*4 = -47+48=1, right_end=-36+48=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\n      So only T=69 is unsafe for Car1.\n\n  For Car2:\n      [25+12*(T-66), 36+12*(T-66)] -> always positive for T>=66, so 0 is never included.\n\n  Therefore, freeway 2 is unsafe at T=69, and safe at other times.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? \n  The input: \"3 | (-36, -47, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12)\"\n  So same as freeway2. So unsafe only at T=69.\n\nFreeway 4: one car: (-60,-25,left,36)\n  For left-moving: \n      left_end = head - 36*(T-66) = -60 - 36*(T-66)\n      right_end = tail - 36*(T-66) = -25 - 36*(T-66)\n      We need: -60 -36*(T-66) <= 0 <= -25 -36*(T-66)\n\n      Let d = T-66\n      So: -60 -36d <= 0  => -36d <= 60 => d >= -60/36 = -1.666 (always true for d>=0)\n      and 0 <= -25 -36d => 36d <= -25 => d <= -25/36 -> negative, which is impossible.\n\n      Therefore, 0 is never in the span? \n\n      But let me check: the interval is [ -60-36d, -25-36d]. Since d>=0, the entire interval is negative? \n        At d=0: [-60, -25] -> all negative, so 0 is not in there.\n        And as d increases, the interval moves left and becomes more negative. So 0 is never covered.\n\n  So freeway4 is always safe.\n\nFreeway5: same as freeway4: (-60,-25,left,36) -> always safe.\n\nFreeway6: one car: (-30,-41,right,6)\n  Right-moving: \n      left_end = tail + 6*(T-66) = -41 + 6d\n      right_end = head + 6*(T-66) = -30 + 6d\n\n      Check: -41+6d <= 0 <= -30+6d\n        First: -41+6d<=0 => 6d<=41 => d<=41/6≈6.833 -> d<=6\n        Second: 0<=-30+6d => 6d>=30 => d>=5\n        So d in [5,6] -> d=5,6.\n\n        At d=5 (T=71): [-41+30, -30+30] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? at the right end -> unsafe.\n        At d=6 (T=72): [-41+36, -30+36] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6] -> unsafe.\n\n        At d=7: [-41+42, -30+42] = [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\n      So unsafe at T=71 and T=72.\n\nFreeway7: two cars: (60,49,right,4) and (12,1,right,4)\n  Car1: (60,49,right,4) -> [49+4d, 60+4d] -> always positive, so 0 not included.\n  Car2: (12,1,right,4) -> [1+4d, 12+4d] -> also always positive. So freeway7 is always safe.\n\nFreeway8: one car: (-39,-50,right,3)\n  Right-moving: \n      left_end = -50 + 3d\n      right_end = -39 + 3d\n      Check: -50+3d <=0<=-39+3d\n        First: -50+3d<=0 => 3d<=50 => d<=16.666\n        Second: 0<=-39+3d => 3d>=39 => d>=13\n        So d from 13 to 16 inclusive.\n\n        d=13 (T=79): [-50+39, -39+39] = [-11,0] -> 0 included -> unsafe.\n        d=14 (T=80): [-50+42, -39+42] = [-8,3] -> 0 included -> unsafe.\n        d=15 (T=81): [-50+45, -39+45] = [-5,6] -> 0 included -> unsafe.\n        d=16 (T=82): [-50+48, -39+48] = [-2,9] -> 0 included -> unsafe.\n        d=17 (T=83): [1,12] -> safe.\n\n      So unsafe at T=79,80,81,82.\n\nSummary of unsafe times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: always safe.\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=69.\nFreeway 3: unsafe at T=69.\nFreeway 4: always safe.\nFreeway 5: always safe.\nFreeway 6: unsafe at T=71,72.\nFreeway 7: always safe.\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=79,80,81,82.\n\nNow, we simulate the player movement.\n\nWe start at (y=2, t=0) (absolute T=66) and we are safe (as we checked).\n\nWe can take actions: U (to y=3), D (to y=1), S (stay at y=2).\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nWe'll do BFS by time (number of steps).\n\nWe keep a queue: (y, t, path) where t is the relative time (so absolute time = 66+t), and path is the sequence of actions so far (from turn66 to turn66+t-1).\n\nBut note: at state (y,t), we have taken t actions (from turn66 to turn66+t-1) and we are at y at time 66+t.\n\nWe then for each action a in [U,D,S]:\n  next_y = y + delta(a)\n  next_t = t+1 (so absolute time = 66+t+1)\n\n  If next_y is out of [0,9] -> invalid.\n\n  Then check if at state (next_y, next_t) is safe: \n      If next_y is 0 or 9 -> safe (since not a freeway)\n      Else (1<=next_y<=8) -> check if at absolute time T=66+t+1, freeway next_y is safe (using our precomputed table).\n\n  If safe, then we can go to (next_y, next_t) and record the action.\n\nWe stop when we reach y=9 at any time.\n\nWe want the minimal t (which is the number of steps taken) so we do BFS and the first time we hit y=9 we stop.\n\nNote: we start at (2,0) and we haven't taken any action yet. Then we take an action at turn66 (which will lead to the next state at relative time t=1).\n\nSo the state (2,0) is the start. Then from there we take the first action.\n\nWe'll generate the next states for the three actions.\n\nWe'll use a queue and a visited set. The state is (y, t). But note: we might come to the same y at a later time and that might be useful if we are avoiding a car? But since we are doing BFS by time (and time is increasing) and we want minimal time, we don't need to revisit a state (y,t) if we already have a path to (y,t) with the same or lower time? Actually, we are doing BFS by time so we first visit states with minimal t. So if we have visited (y,t) then we skip.\n\nBut note: we might have multiple ways to get to (y,t) and we only need one.\n\nWe'll do:\n\nLet visited[0..9][t] be a boolean array, initially false.\n\nWe start at (2,0) and mark visited[2][0]=true.\n\nThen we enqueue (2,0) with path [].\n\nThen while queue not empty:\n   pop state (y, t, path)\n   if y==9: then we output the path (which has length t) and stop.\n\n   Otherwise, for each action a in [U,D,S]:\n        next_y = y + (1 if a='U', -1 if a='D', 0 if a='S')\n        if next_y not in [0,9]: skip? Actually, we can go to 0 and 9, but 0 is safe and 9 is goal. But we are going up, but if we go down to 1, we can. But we want minimal time, so going down might be necessary? However, in this case we are going to 9, so going down would be counterproductive? But we have obstacles that might force us to wait or go down? \n\n        We'll allow any move as long as next_y in [0,9].\n\n        next_t = t+1\n        absolute_time = 66 + next_t   # because at the next state, we are at absolute time 66+next_t\n\n        Check safety at (next_y, absolute_time):\n            if next_y is 0 or 9 -> safe\n            else: check our precomputed safe[freeway=next_y][absolute_time]\n\n        If safe, and not visited[next_y][next_t]:\n            mark visited and enqueue (next_y, next_t, path + [a])\n\nWe start at t=0, and we take the first action that leads to t=1.\n\nWe'll set a limit for t, say up to 20.\n\nNow, we run the BFS.\n\nWe'll do it step by step for minimal time.\n\nWe want to get to 9 in 7 steps? But we have obstacles.\n\nList of obstacles:\n\n  At absolute time T=69 (which is relative t = 69-66 = 3): freeway 2 and 3 are unsafe. \n  At T=71 (t=5) and T=72 (t=6): freeway 6 unsafe.\n  At T=79 (t=13) to T=82 (t=16): freeway8 unsafe.\n\nWe start at y=2 at T=66 (t=0).\n\nWe need to go from 2 to 9: so we must pass through y=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nWe want to avoid being on freeway 2 at T=69? But we start at freeway2 at T=66. Then we move up to freeway3 at T=67? or stay?\n\nWe have to avoid being on freeway2 or freeway3 at T=69.\n\nSimilarly, avoid freeway6 at T=71 and 72, and freeway8 at T=79 to 82.\n\nBut note: we can be on other freeways at those times.\n\nWe'll simulate:\n\nWe'll try to go up as fast as possible:\n\nOption 1: UUUUUUU (7 ups) -> we go from 2 to 9 in 7 steps.\n\nThe path:\n\nTurn66 (action0): U -> at T=67, y=3\nTurn67: U -> T=68, y=4\nTurn68: U -> T=69, y=5 -> at T=69, we are on freeway5 -> safe (always safe) -> so far safe.\nTurn69: U -> T=70, y=6 -> freeway6 at T=70: is it safe? \n        Freeway6: unsafe at T=71 and 72, but T=70 is safe? \n        From our precomputation: freeway6 unsafe at 71 and 72, so T=70 is safe.\nTurn70: U -> T=71, y=7 -> freeway7 at T=71: always safe -> safe.\nTurn71: U -> T=72, y=8 -> freeway8 at T=72: unsafe? \n        Our precomputation: freeway8 unsafe at T=79,80,81,82 -> so T=72 is safe.\nTurn72: U -> T=73, y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo in 7 moves: U,U,U,U,U,U,U.\n\nBut wait: at the last move at turn72 (absolute T=72+66=138? No: we started at turn66.\n\nLet me compute absolute times:\n\nStart: turn66: at y=2 (T=66) -> safe.\nAction0 (turn66): U -> then at T=67, y=3 -> freeway3: at T=67: we need to check freeway3 at T=67. \n   We precomputed freeway3 unsafe at T=69 only. So T=67 is safe.\n\nAction1 (turn67): U -> T=68, y=4 -> freeway4: always safe -> safe.\n\nAction2 (turn68): U -> T=69, y=5 -> freeway5: always safe -> safe.\n\nAction3 (turn69): U -> T=70, y=6 -> freeway6: unsafe at T=71,72 -> T=70 is safe.\n\nAction4 (turn70): U -> T=71, y=7 -> freeway7: always safe -> safe.\n\nAction5 (turn71): U -> T=72, y=8 -> freeway8: unsafe at T=79-82, so T=72 is safe.\n\nAction6 (turn72): U -> T=73, y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo we reached at T=73 (absolute) which is turn73. The sequence of actions is 7 actions: U at each step.\n\nBut note: we are at y=9 at turn73, which is after 7 actions (from turn66 to turn72). So H = number of turns? The problem says: minimal number of turns H and the sequence of actions from t1 (66) to t1+H-1.\n\nWe take H-1 actions? \n\nWe start at turn66. We take actions at turn66, turn67, ... turn66+H-2, and then at turn66+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\nIn our case: \n  After 0 actions: turn66, y=2.\n  After 1 action: turn67, y=3.\n  ...\n  After 7 actions: turn73, y=9.\n\nSo we are at y=9 at turn73 = 66+7. Therefore, H=7? \n\nBut the problem: we take actions from t1 to t1+H-1. That would be H actions? \n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take H actions? \n\nBut then we would be at y_{t1+H} = 9. \n\nBut note the update: \n  After taking action at turn t, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn t1+H, we take H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nIn our case: we take 7 actions (from turn66 to turn72) and then at turn73 (which is t1+7) we are at y=9.\n\nSo H=7.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and the sequence of actions for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nSo we have H=7, and the actions are for turns 66 to 72 (7 turns).\n\nBut the problem says: \"Turn t_1: a_{t1}\" meaning the action at the starting turn.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 66: U\nTurn 67: U\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: U\n\nAnd then at turn73 we are at 9.\n\nBut we must check if we are safe at every step? We did:\n\nT=66: y=2 -> safe (freeway2 at T=66: safe)\nT=67: y=3 -> freeway3 at T=67: safe (only unsafe at T=69)\nT=68: y=4 -> safe (freeway4 always safe)\nT=69: y=5 -> safe (freeway5 always safe)\nT=70: y=6 -> freeway6 at T=70: safe (only unsafe at 71,72)\nT=71: y=7 -> safe (freeway7 always safe)\nT=72: y=8 -> freeway8 at T=72: safe (only unsafe at 79-82)\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". We never stepped on freeway1? We started at 2 and went up: 2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9. So we were on freeways 2,3,4,5,6,7,8. And we checked all.\n\nSo the answer is 7 turns.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence. We have H=7.\n\nBut let me check the goal: we are to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nBut note: the actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we update to y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy_{t1+H-1}.\n\nBut the problem says: we reach at turn t1+H-1? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nBut at turn t1+H-1, we are about to take an action? Or after the action? \n\nLet me read the update: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\", meaning that at the end of turn t, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, at the start of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we take action a_t, and then we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at the start of a turn, that would be y_t = 9 for some turn t.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\", meaning that at the turn we reach, we are at (0,9). \n\nBut note: the collision condition is checked at the start of the turn? The problem says \"at turn T\" and we are at y_T at turn T.\n\nSo we want that at turn T, we are at (0,9) and that turn T we are at y=9 (which is safe). \n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThat is, at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nBut in our plan, we are at y=9 at the start of turn73 (which is t1+7). So H-1 = 7? Then H=8.\n\nBut that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take H actions and then we are at y=9 at the start of turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"reach at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nLet me read carefully:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nSo we reach at turn t1+H-1. That means at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9).\n\nBut in our simulation, we are at (0,9) at the start of turn73 = 66+7 = t1+7. So we have t1+H-1 = t1+7 -> H-1 = 7 -> H=8.\n\nBut we took 7 actions? \n\nHow do we get to be at y=9 at the start of a turn without taking an action that same turn?\n\nWe start at turn66 (t1) at y=2. Then we take an action at turn66 to move to y=3 at the start of turn67? \n\nBut the problem: at the start of turn66, we are at y=2. Then we take action a_66, which updates to y_{67}=2+Δy. Then at the start of turn67, we are at y_{67}.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, we must have arrived there by the action taken at turn (t1+H-2).\n\nTherefore, we need to take H-1 actions: from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2.\n\nIn our case: we want to be at y=9 at the start of turn t1+7 (which is 73). Then H-1 = 7 -> H=8.\n\nBut then we must have taken actions at turns 66,67,...,72 (7 actions) to be at y=9 at the start of turn73.\n\nSo the minimal number of turns H is 8? But that doesn't make sense because we took 7 actions.\n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". What does H represent? It says \"the minimal number of turns H\". And then the sequence is for turns from t1 to t1+H-1, which is H actions.\n\nBut then we are at y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me see the example in the problem? There isn't one.\n\nBut note: the player update: \n   y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo after action at turn t, we are at y_{t+1} at the start of turn t+1? Actually, the state at the start of turn t+1 is y_{t+1}.\n\nSo if we take an action at turn t, we are updating to the position at the next turn.\n\nTherefore, to be at y=9 at the start of turn T, we must have taken an action at turn T-1.\n\nWe start at turn66 at y=2. We want to be at y=9 at the start of some turn T. Then we took an action at turn T-1.\n\nThe number of turns we have taken actions: from turn66 to turn T-1: that is (T-1 - 66 + 1) = T-66 actions.\n\nAnd T = turn number when we are at y=9.\n\nThe minimal H in the problem is the number of turns? The problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has H actions? \n\nBut then we are at turn66+H after the last action? So at the start of turn66+H, we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach at turn t1+H-1\", meaning at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo: t1+H-1 = 66+H-1.\n\nWe want that at the start of turn 66+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nBut we are at y=9 at the start of turn66+H-1 only if we took an action at turn66+H-2 that made us land there.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of actions should be from turn66 to turn66+H-2? That is, H-1 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, meaning from t1+0 to t1+H-1: H actions.\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nLooking back: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nAnd then \"to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nBut if we take H actions, we are taking actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then after the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we update to y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy_{t1+H-1}.\n\nSo we are at y_{t1+H} at the start of turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says we reach at turn t1+H-1? That is at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nTherefore, we must have y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nBut then we do not take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut the sequence includes an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and then at the start of turn t1+H, we are at y=9. And that is the turn we reach? But the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"turn\" in \"minimal number of turns H\" refers to the number of game turns (from the start turn to the end turn), and the actions are taken in the first H-1 turns? \n\nBut the problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence of actions for H turns? \n\nI think there is a misunderstanding.\n\nLet me look again: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nSo the sequence has H actions (t=0 to H-1) and we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut how can that be? At turn t1+H-1, we are about to take the last action a_{t1+H-1}. Then after taking that action, we go to y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy_{t1+H-1}. So unless we are already at y=9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action that might move us away? \n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9), so we want to be there at the start of a turn.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action (which might be S, U, or D) at turn t1+H-1. But if we take U or D, we move away, so we would take S.\n\nBut the problem doesn't say that we have to stay there, it says \"reach\" at that turn.\n\nSo if we are at y=9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, then we have reached, and then we take an action at that turn (which could be S) and then we are still at 9 at the next turn. But the problem doesn't require to stay, only to reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo the condition is: at the start of turn t1+H-1, y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nThen the actions we take are from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2, because the action at turn t1+H-2 updates to y_{t1+H-1}.\n\nAnd then at turn t1+H-1, we take an action a_{t1+H-1} (which is in the sequence) but that action doesn't affect our arrival (since we are already there) but we are allowed to take it.\n\nBut then the sequence has H actions, but the last action is taken after we have arrived.\n\nThis is a bit odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that we take actions for H turns and then at the end of the last action we are at (0,9), which is at the start of turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says \"at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nTo resolve, let me assume that the problem means:\n\nWe take H actions (at turns t1 to t1+H-1) and then at the start of turn t1+H, we are at y=9. But then the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\", which is not when we are at y=9.\n\nGiven the confusion, let me read the problem again: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nAnd the player is at (0, y_t) at turn t.\n\nSo if we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, that means at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9).\n\nThen, to get there, we must have taken actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2, because the action at turn t1+H-2 updates to y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nThen the sequence of actions should be for turns t1 to t1+H-2, which is H-1 actions.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, which is H actions.\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nPerhaps the indexing is off by one.\n\nLooking at the answer format: it says to output actions for turns: Turn t1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, etc.\n\nAnd it says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" which is H actions.\n\nThen to reach at turn t1+H-1, we must have that after taking the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H? But the problem says turn t1+H-1.\n\nI think there might be a typo in the problem.\n\nGiven that in our simulation we are at y=9 at the start of turn73 = t1+7, then if we interpret that we reach at turn t1+7, then H-1 = 7 -> H=8, and then the sequence of actions has H=8 actions? But we only took 7 actions to get there.\n\nAlternatively, if we are to be at y=9 at the start of turn73, then we took actions at turns66 to turn72 (7 actions) to get there. So the sequence should be 7 actions, and then at turn73 (which is turn t1+7) we are at 9.\n\nThen the minimal number of turns H should be 7? But the problem says we reach at turn t1+H-1, so 66+7-1=72. But at turn72, we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn72 (t1+6), then we would have to get there faster, but we can't in 6 actions because we need to move up 7 steps.\n\nTherefore, the only logical interpretation is that we take H actions and then we are at y=9 at the start of turn t1+H.\n\nSo the reach turn is t1+H.\n\nThen the problem should have said \"reach at turn t1+H\".\n\nBut it says \"t1+H-1\".\n\nGiven the time, and since the problem might have a typo, and given that our simulation shows we can get there in 7 actions and be at y=9 at turn73 = t1+7, I'll assume that the intended meaning is that we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H, and we take H actions (from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1).\n\nThen H=7.\n\nAnd the sequence is 7 actions: U at each step.\n\nThen the answer is:\n\nTurn 66: U\nTurn 67: U\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: U\n\nBut to be safe, let me see if there is a problem with the last step? \n\nAt turn72, we take action U from y=8 to y=9, and then at turn73 we are at 9. But the problem might require that we are at 9 at the turn we take the last action? That is, at turn72, we are at y=8, and then we take U and then we are at 9 at turn73.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoiding collisions\" and during turn72, we are at y=8 (freeway8) at turn72, which is safe. Then we move to y=9 at turn73.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nTherefore, I think H=7 and the sequence is 7 U's.\n\nBut let me double-check if we can do it in 6 actions? That would require moving up 7 steps in 6 actions? Impossible.\n\nSo minimal H is 7.\n\nBut if the problem insists on reaching at turn t1+H-1, then we would have to be at y=9 at turn72 = t1+6, which requires only 6 actions, but we need 7 moves up? That's impossible.\n\nTherefore, I believe the problem has a typo and it should be \"at turn t1+H\".\n\nOr sometimes in such problems, the initial turn is counted.\n\nAnother interpretation: the minimal number of turns H means the number of turns that have passed, including the starting turn? Then from turn66 to turn73 is 8 turns. But then the sequence of actions is for turns66 to turn72, which is 7 actions.\n\nThe problem says \"a sequence of actions\" of length H? But if H=8, then we would have 8 actions.\n\nI think the safest is to output the 7 actions that we know work, and state H=7.\n\nBut the answer format requires to output the actions for turns from t1 to t1+H-1, so if H=7, then turns 66 to 72.\n\nAnd we have that.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's see if there is a reason to wait? For example, if we wait at some point, can we avoid the obstacles? But we didn't hit any obstacle in this path.\n\nAlternatively, if we had hit an obstacle, we might have to wait. But here we didn't.\n\nSo the answer is 7 U's.\n\nBut let me write it in the box.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 66: U\nTurn 67: U\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", but in the answer format we only output the actions. So we don't need to output H.\n\nThe user says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\", but the answer format only requires the actions. So we output the actions.\n\nAnd since we found a sequence of 7 actions that works, and it's minimal, we output that.\n\nSo final answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal sequence of actions to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn 66, while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), requires 7 actions. The sequence consists of moving up (U) at each turn, as this path avoids all car collisions:\n\n- At turn 66, the player is at \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2). Cars on freeway 2 at turn 66 are safe (0 is not in any car's span).\n- Moving up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 67 (freeway 3) is safe, as freeway 3 is unsafe only at turn 69.\n- Moving up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 68 (freeway 4) is safe, as freeway 4 is always safe.\n- Moving up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 69 (freeway 5) is safe, as freeway 5 is always safe.\n- Moving up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 70 (freeway 6) is safe, as freeway 6 is unsafe at turns 71 and 72, but safe at turn 70.\n- Moving up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 71 (freeway 7) is safe, as freeway 7 is always safe.\n- Moving up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 72 (freeway 8) is safe, as freeway 8 is unsafe at turns 79 to 82, but safe at turn 72.\n- After the last action at turn 72, the player moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 73, which is the goal and not a freeway.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal number of actions (7) and avoids all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 66: U \\\\\nTurn 67: U \\\\\nTurn 68: U \\\\\nTurn 69: U \\\\\nTurn 70: U \\\\\nTurn 71: U \\\\\nTurn 72: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 67, and the player is at (0,3). The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player moves vertically: \n  U: y += 1\n  D: y -= 1\n  S: y remains\n\nThe player can only be at y in [0,9]. We start at y=3 and wish to get to y=9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway y has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player is always 0).\n\nImportant note: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on y_T during turn T. Therefore, at turn T, we check the car on freeway y_T. Only when the player is on a freeway (y between 1 and 8) and at that turn the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0, then there is a collision.\n\nAlso note: if the player moves to a new freeway at turn T (so at turn T+1 the player is on a different row), then during turn T the player is still on the old row. So at the moment of the move (turn T), the car on the destination row (y_{T+1}) is not checked until the next turn (T+1).\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1=67. For each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed). The update for the cars is linear:\n\nFor a left-moving car (which we assume is when the direction is 'left'? but note the representation: \n  In the table, for freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48) -> but the update rule says:\n    Left-moving: [h, τ] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n    Right-moving: [τ, h] -> becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nWait, the representation of the car state is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). We must interpret:\n\nFor a right-moving car: the head is the front, which is at a higher x-coordinate? Actually, the update rule for right-moving is: \n  [τ, h] -> [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the input, we have (head, tail, ...). So we need to know: in the input, for a right-moving car, is the head the larger coordinate? \n\nLooking at the example for freeway 2: (-24, -35, right, 12) and (48, 37, right, 12). \n\nFor the first car: (-24, -35, right, 12). Since it's right-moving, the head should be the larger coordinate? But -24 > -35? Yes, -24 is greater than -35. So the head is the front (larger x) and tail is the back (smaller x). So the span for a right-moving car is [tail, head]? \n\nThe update rule for right-moving: \n  Initially (at t1) the span is [τ, h] (which is [tail, head]) and at time T, it becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: \n  The initial span is [h, τ] (so head and tail, but note: head is the front? and for left-moving the front is at a smaller x? because it moves left) -> then the update: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut in the input, for the left-moving car on freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36). Here, 48 is head and 83 is tail? But 83>48, so if it's left-moving, the head (front) should be at a higher x? and then it moves left. But wait, the update rule says for left-moving: the span is [h, τ] -> which would be [48,83]? That doesn't make sense because 48<83, so the car would be from 48 to 83? and then as it moves left, the entire segment moves left.\n\nBut note: the update rule for left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. If initially h=48, τ=83, then at t1 the car is from 48 to 83? and then at time T, it becomes [48 - s*(T-t1), 83 - s*(T-t1)]. This is a segment that is moving left and remains of length 83-48=35.\n\nHowever, in the update rule it says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. But if h=48 and τ=83, then the car is from 48 to 83? That's a length of 35, and then moving left.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ\". The head is the front? For left-moving, the front is at the leftmost? or the rightmost? \n\nActually, in the update rule, the representation of the car's position is independent of the direction: \n  For left-moving: the head is at h and the tail is at τ, and the entire car is between min(h,τ) and max(h,τ)? Not necessarily: the update rule for left-moving uses [h, τ] and then subtracts. \n\nBut note the example: freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36). If the car is left-moving, and the head is 48 and tail is 83, then the car is from 48 to 83? That is a segment of 35 units. Then as it moves left, both endpoints decrease. But the head (front) of a left-moving car should be the leftmost? Then why is the head at 48 and tail at 83? That would mean the head is at 48 (left) and the tail at 83 (right)? That doesn't make sense because when moving left, the front is the leftmost.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the representation of the car is always given with the head being the front and the tail being the rear, regardless of direction? Then for a left-moving car, the front (head) is at a smaller x than the tail? But in the example, 48<83, so head=48, tail=83: then the front is at 48 and the rear at 83? Then the car is from 48 to 83? and it moves left: so the entire segment moves left. Then the front (head) is the leftmost? Actually, when the car moves left, the front is the leftmost. So that makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, for a right-moving car, the head is the front (rightmost) and the tail is the rear (leftmost). So for freeway 2: (-24, -35, right, 12): head=-24 (front) and tail=-35 (rear). The car is from -35 to -24? Then it moves right: both endpoints increase.\n\nBut note: the update rule for right-moving uses [τ, h] and then adds. That is, the initial span is [tail, head]? So in the example, tail=-35, head=-24 -> the car is from -35 to -24? That's consistent.\n\nTherefore, we can interpret:\n\nFor a car (head, tail, direction, speed):\n  The car occupies the segment from min(head, tail) to max(head, tail) at time t1? But wait, no: for right-moving, the tail is the left end and head the right end? and for left-moving, the head is the left end and tail the right end? \n\nActually, the update rule tells us:\n\n- For right-moving: the initial span is [τ, h] (tail, head) and then it moves by adding s*(T-t1) to both. So the car is from τ to h (which are the tail and head, and τ <= h).\n\n- For left-moving: the initial span is [h, τ]? But then if h>τ, then [h, τ] would be from τ to h? Actually, the update rule says [h, τ] and then subtracts. So the car is from h to τ? But if h>τ, then that would be [τ, h] again? \n\nWait, the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" meaning the interval from h to τ? But in mathematics, [a,b] with a>b is not standard. So we must assume that for a left-moving car, the head h is the leftmost and the tail τ is the rightmost? Then the interval is [h, τ] and h<=τ? Similarly, for right-moving, the tail is the leftmost and head the rightmost? Then the interval is [tail, head] and tail<=head.\n\nBut in the given data:\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48) -> tail=-95, head=-48 -> so the car is from -95 to -48? (since -95<-48). Then at time t1=67, the car is at [-95, -48]. Then it moves right: at time T, it will be at [-95+48*(T-67), -48+48*(T-67)].\n\nFreeway 2: (-24, -35, right, 12) -> tail=-35, head=-24 -> car from -35 to -24? and then (48,37,right,12): wait, here head=48, tail=37? But 37<48, so that's consistent? Actually, no: the representation is (head, tail, ...). For the second car: head=48, tail=37 -> but tail=37 and head=48? then the car is from 37 to 48? But the update rule for right-moving uses [tail, head] so [37,48]? Then it moves right: [37+12*(T-67), 48+12*(T-67)].\n\nBut wait, the input says: (48,37,right,12) -> so head=48, tail=37. That means the front (head) is at 48 and the rear (tail) at 37? Then the car is from 37 to 48? That's correct for a right-moving car: the tail is the left end (37) and head the right end (48).\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: freeway 4: (48,83,left,36) -> head=48, tail=83. Then the car is from head to tail? meaning from 48 to 83? and moves left: so at time T, [48-36*(T-67), 83-36*(T-67)].\n\nBut note: the head is the front (for left-moving, the front is the left end) and tail is the rear (right end). So the car occupies [head, tail] = [48,83]? But that's from 48 to 83? and then moves left.\n\nSo in summary, we can define the car's initial (at t1=67) segment as:\n  For a car (h, t, d, s):\n      if d is 'right': then the segment is [t, h] (since tail t is the left end and head h the right end) and t <= h.\n      if d is 'left': then the segment is [h, t] (since head h is the left end and tail t the right end) and h <= t.\n\nBut in the given data, we see for right-moving: \n  freeway2: (-24,-35,right,12) -> t=-35, h=-24 -> then segment is [-35, -24] -> which is correct because -35<-24.\n  freeway2: (48,37,right,12) -> t=37, h=48 -> segment [37,48] -> correct.\n\nFor left-moving: \n  freeway4: (48,83,left,36) -> h=48, t=83 -> segment [48,83] -> but 48<83, so the segment is [48,83]? Then the car is from 48 to 83? and then moves left.\n\nBut note: the collision condition is that the player is at (0, y) at turn T, and we require that 0 is in the segment of the car on freeway y at turn T.\n\nSo for a car on freeway y at turn T, we need to compute the segment at turn T and check if 0 is in that segment.\n\nWe are to find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) for the player, starting at turn t1=67, at position y=3, and we want to get to y=9 in minimal turns.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway row (1..8) at a turn T if the car on that row at turn T has a segment that includes 0.\n\nNote: at the start (turn 67), we are at y=3. We must check the car on freeway 3? But note: we are at turn 67, so we are on freeway 3 at turn 67. We must check the cars on freeway 3 at turn 67.\n\nFreeway 3: Cars: (-24, -35, right, 12) and (48, 37, right, 12). \n\nFirst car: right-moving, segment at t1: [tail, head] = [-35, -24]. \nSecond car: right-moving, segment at t1: [37,48].\n\nAt turn 67, the player is at (0,3). We need to check if 0 is in any of the segments for freeway 3 at turn 67? \n  First car: [-35, -24] -> 0 is not in this segment? (since -24 < 0 is false, because -24 is negative and 0 is greater than -24? Actually, -35 <= 0 <= -24? -> 0 is not between -35 and -24 because -24 is negative and 0 is greater than -24? So 0 is not in [-35,-24] because -24 < 0? -> so no.\n\n  Second car: [37,48] -> 0 is not in [37,48]. \n\nSo we are safe at turn 67.\n\nNow, we need to plan a sequence to get to y=9. The minimal number of moves without any obstacles would be 6 moves: from 3 to 9: we need 6 moves of U. But we have to avoid cars on freeways 4,5,6,7,8 as we go up? and also we might have to wait (use S) to avoid cars.\n\nWe are only concerned with freeways 1 to 8, but we are starting at 3 and going to 9 (which is above 8). So we will pass through freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8 and then 9. But note: 9 is the goal and is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8). So we don't check cars on row 9.\n\nWe are at turn 67 at y=3. We can choose to move U (to y=4 at turn 68), D (to y=2 at turn 68) or S (stay at y=3 at turn 68). But we want to go up, so D is not helpful. However, sometimes we might have to wait.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway and for each turn T (>=67) the car segments and check if at turn T, if the player is on that freeway, then 0 must not be in the segment.\n\nWe are going to try to find the minimal H such that we can get to y=9 in H-1 moves? Note: the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1, meaning from turn t1 to t1+H-1? Actually, the problem says: sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} and then at turn t1+H-1 the player is at 9. \n\nWe start at turn t1=67, and we are at y=3. Then at turn 67 we take action a_{67} (which is the first action). Then at turn 68, we are at y_{68} = y_67 + Delta(a_{67}). Then at turn 68 we take a_{68}, etc.\n\nWe want to minimize H (the number of actions, which is the number of turns from t1 to t1+H-1, so H turns? Actually, the actions are taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and then at the end of turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9. So the total number of turns we play is H, and we end at turn t1+H-1.\n\nWe are to output the actions for turns 67, 68, ... until the last action.\n\nWe need to simulate the car movements. Since the cars move linearly, we can compute the segment at any turn T.\n\nWe are going to try to move as fast as possible: 6 moves of U. But we must check for collisions.\n\nLet's simulate the car positions at the necessary turns.\n\nWe are going to traverse freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8. But note: we might not go in a straight line? We might have to wait (S) or even go down? But going down would be counterproductive. So we hope to go up without waiting, but if there is a car blocking, we might have to wait.\n\nWe'll compute for each freeway and for the turns when we might be on that freeway, whether 0 is covered by a car on that freeway.\n\nFirst, let's compute the car positions for each freeway. We'll note that multiple cars on the same freeway: we must check all.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n  It's right-moving: segment at t1=67: [tail, head] = [-95, -48] -> but wait, the input is (head, tail) = (-48, -95) -> so head=-48, tail=-95? Then for right-moving: the segment is [tail, head] = [-95, -48]. \n  At turn T: segment = [-95 + 48*(T-67), -48 + 48*(T-67)]\n\nFreeway 2: two cars: \n  Car1: (head=-24, tail=-35, right, 12) -> segment at t1: [-35, -24]\n      At T: [-35 + 12*(T-67), -24 + 12*(T-67)]\n  Car2: (head=48, tail=37, right, 12) -> segment at t1: [37,48]\n      At T: [37+12*(T-67), 48+12*(T-67)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway2? \n  Cars: (-24, -35, right, 12) and (48,37,right,12) -> same as freeway2.\n\nFreeway 4: one car: (48,83,left,36) \n  Left-moving: segment at t1: [head, tail] = [48,83] (since head=48, tail=83, and head<=tail)\n  At T: [48 - 36*(T-67), 83 - 36*(T-67)]\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway4: (48,83,left,36) -> same.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (-24, -35, right, 6) \n  Right-moving: segment at t1: [tail, head] = [-35, -24]\n  At T: [-35 + 6*(T-67), -24 + 6*(T-67)]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars:\n  Car1: (-48, -59, right, 4) -> segment at t1: [tail, head] = [-59, -48]\n      At T: [-59 + 4*(T-67), -48 + 4*(T-67)]\n  Car2: (16,5,right,4) -> wait, head=16, tail=5? -> segment at t1: [5,16]\n      At T: [5+4*(T-67), 16+4*(T-67)]\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (-36, -47, right, 3)\n  Segment at t1: [tail, head] = [-47, -36]\n  At T: [-47 + 3*(T-67), -36 + 3*(T-67)]\n\nWe are going to simulate the player moving upward. We start at turn67 at y=3. We wish to be at y=9 at the last turn.\n\nWe consider the turns when we are on freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8. We must avoid being on a freeway when 0 is in the segment of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nWe'll try to go straight up: 6 consecutive U.\n\nTurn67: at y=3 -> freeway3: we already checked at turn67: safe.\n\nTurn67: action U -> then at turn68, we are at y=4.\n\nTurn68: at y=4 -> freeway4. Check freeway4 at turn68.\n\nFreeway4 at turn68: \n  T = 68 -> T-67 = 1\n  Car: [48 - 36*1, 83 - 36*1] = [12, 47]\n  Is 0 in [12,47]? -> no.\n\nSo safe.\n\nAction at turn68: U -> then at turn69, y=5.\n\nTurn69: at y=5 -> freeway5. Check freeway5 at turn69.\n\nFreeway5: same car as freeway4? \n  At T=69: T-67=2 -> [48-36*2, 83-36*2] = [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11]\n  Is 0 in [-24,11]? -> yes, because -24<=0<=11.\n\nCollision! So we cannot be at freeway5 at turn69.\n\nTherefore, we cannot do U at turn68? Or we must wait at y=4 for one turn?\n\nAlternatively, we might change the timing.\n\nLet me see: at turn68 we are at y=4. If we do not move at turn68 (action S), then we stay at y=4 for turn69? \n\nAt turn68: action S -> then at turn69, we are still at y=4? But we already were at y=4 at turn68? So at turn69 we are still at freeway4? \n\nWe must check freeway4 at turn69: \n  T=69, T-67=2 -> [48-36*2, 83-36*2] = [-24,11] -> 0 is in [-24,11]? -> yes. So if we are at freeway4 at turn69, we collide.\n\nSo waiting at y=4 for turn68 (so that at turn69 we are still at y=4) is also not safe.\n\nWhat if we do not go up at turn67? We could stay at y=3 for one turn? \n\nTurn67: action S -> then at turn68, we are still at y=3. Check freeway3 at turn68.\n\nFreeway3 at turn68 (T=68, T-67=1):\n  Car1: [-35+12*1, -24+12*1] = [-23, -12] -> 0 not in this.\n  Car2: [37+12*1, 48+12*1] = [49,60] -> 0 not in this.\n\nSafe.\n\nThen at turn68, we can do U -> to y=4 at turn69.\n\nNow, at turn69: at y=4 -> freeway4. Check freeway4 at turn69: T=69, T-67=2 -> [-24,11] -> 0 in the segment -> collision.\n\nSo that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, at turn67 we do U to go to y=4 at turn68, then at turn68 we do D to go back to y=3 at turn69? But then we are at y=3 at turn69: check freeway3 at turn69.\n\nFreeway3 at turn69 (T=69, T-67=2):\n  Car1: [-35+12*2, -24+12*2] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0] -> 0 is in [-11,0]? -> yes! So collision.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nWhat if we wait at y=3 for two turns?\n\nTurn67: S -> at turn68: y=3 -> safe (as above at turn68: freeway3 safe).\nTurn68: S -> at turn69: y=3 -> check freeway3 at turn69: \n  Car1: [-35+12*2, -24+12*2] = [-11,0] -> 0 in [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot stay at y=3 at turn69.\n\nTherefore, we must leave y=3 by turn68 at the latest? \n\nAt turn67: we have two options: U or S? (D would go to y=2, which is freeway2? but we don't want to go down? but let's check freeway2 at turn67: \n  Freeway2: two cars at turn67: \n      Car1: [-35, -24] -> 0 not in.\n      Car2: [37,48] -> 0 not in.\n  So safe. But if we go down to y=2 at turn68, then we are at freeway2 at turn68? \n      Freeway2 at turn68 (T=68, T-67=1): \n          Car1: [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n          Car2: [37+12,48+12] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\nThen we can go back up? But that would be inefficient.\n\nBut we are trying to minimize H, so we want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid freeway5 at turn69 by delaying our arrival at freeway5.\n\nWe note that the car on freeway5 (and freeway4) moves left at 36 units per turn. The segment at turn67: [48,83] -> then at turn69: [48-72,83-72] = [-24,11]. Then at turn70: [48-36*3,83-36*3] = [48-108,83-108] = [-60,-25] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo if we can be at freeway5 at turn70 instead of turn69, then safe.\n\nHow to do that? \n\nWe start at turn67 at y=3.\n\nOption 1:\n  Turn67: U -> y=4 at turn68.\n  Turn68: S -> stay at y=4 at turn69? \n      At turn69: at freeway4 -> check freeway4 at turn69: [-24,11] -> unsafe.\n\nOption 2:\n  Turn67: U -> y=4 at turn68.\n  Turn68: U -> then we are at y=5 at turn69 -> unsafe (freeway5 at turn69).\n\nOption 3:\n  Turn67: S -> stay at y=3 at turn68.\n  Turn68: U -> then at turn69: y=4 -> freeway4 at turn69: unsafe.\n\nOption 4:\n  Turn67: S -> at turn68: y=3.\n  Turn68: S -> at turn69: y=3 -> unsafe (freeway3 at turn69: car1 covers 0).\n\nBut we see that we must avoid being at freeway3 at turn69 and freeway4 at turn69 and freeway5 at turn69? \n\nWe are at y=3 at turn67. We want to get to y=5 eventually. We can go:\n\n  Turn67: U -> to y=4 at turn68 (safe for freeway4 at turn68: [12,47] -> safe).\n  Then we must avoid being at y=4 at turn69? because freeway4 at turn69 is unsafe.\n\n  So at turn68, we must leave y=4. We can go up to y=5? but then at turn69 we are at freeway5: unsafe.\n\n  Or go down to y=3? then at turn69 we are at freeway3: unsafe.\n\n  So we must leave y=4 at turn68? But we just arrived at turn68. The only options are to leave at the same turn? no, we have to take an action at turn68 to move.\n\n  We are stuck? \n\nAlternatively, we can try to go faster: but we are already moving up as fast as we can? \n\nOr we can try to wait at y=3 for one turn, then at turn68 go to y=4, but then at turn69 we are at y=4 and unsafe.\n\nBut wait, what if we wait at y=3 for one turn (turn67: S) and then at turn68 we go to y=4? Then at turn69 we are at y=4 and unsafe. \n\nBut what if we then at turn69 we go up to y=5? That would be at turn70? \n\nBut at turn69: we are at y=4 and it's unsafe -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=4 at turn69.\n\nHow about we go from y=3 to y=4 at a later time? \n\nWe need to be at freeway5 at a turn when the car is not covering 0. We saw that at turn70, freeway5 is safe: segment [-60,-25] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo we want to be at freeway5 at turn70? \n\nBut we must also consider the timing for freeway4 and freeway3.\n\nWe start at turn67 at y=3.\n\nWe want to be at y=5 at turn70? \n\nThen:\n  turn67: at y=3.\n  turn68: at y=4? \n  turn69: at y=5? -> but then at turn69 we are at freeway5: unsafe.\n\n  Or:\n  turn67: at y=3.\n  turn68: at y=3 (if we do S at turn67, then at turn68 we are at y=3) -> then turn68: U -> to y=4 at turn69.\n  turn69: at y=4 -> freeway4 at turn69: unsafe.\n\n  Or:\n  turn67: U -> to y=4 at turn68.\n  turn68: S -> stay at y=4 at turn69 -> unsafe.\n\n  Or:\n  turn67: U -> to y=4 at turn68.\n  turn68: U -> to y=5 at turn69 -> unsafe.\n\n  Or:\n  turn67: U -> to y=4 at turn68.\n  turn68: D -> to y=3 at turn69 -> then at turn69: freeway3: unsafe.\n\nSo none of the ways to be at y=5 at turn70 by the above paths work because we get stuck in an unsafe freeway at turn69.\n\nBut wait, what if we are at y=5 at turn70? Then we must have been at y=4 at turn69? and at turn69 we are at freeway4: unsafe.\n\nUnless we jump from y=3 to y=5 in one move? But we can only move by 1 each turn. So we must go through y=4.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=4 at some turn, and then at the next turn we go to y=5. The problem is that at turn69, both freeway4 and freeway5 are unsafe.\n\nBut freeway4 at turn69 is unsafe, and freeway5 at turn69 is unsafe. However, at turn70, freeway5 is safe.\n\nSo if we can be at y=4 at turn68 (safe) and then at turn69 we are still at y=4 (but that's unsafe) or we go to y=5 (unsafe). \n\nUnless we can skip the turn69 for freeway4 and freeway5 by being at a different row? \n\nBut we have to be at either y=4 or y=5 at turn69 if we want to be at y=5 at turn70.\n\nHow about this: \n  turn67: U -> y=4 at turn68 (safe for freeway4).\n  turn68: U -> y=5 at turn69 -> unsafe (freeway5 at turn69).\n\n  turn67: U -> y=4 at turn68.\n  turn68: S -> y=4 at turn69 -> unsafe (freeway4 at turn69).\n\n  turn67: U -> y=4 at turn68.\n  turn68: D -> y=3 at turn69 -> unsafe (freeway3 at turn69).\n\nSo we have to avoid being on freeway3,4,5 at turn69.\n\nWhat if we go up to y=6 or higher by turn69? \n\nFrom y=4 at turn68, we can only go to y=5 at turn69. We cannot jump to y=6 in one move.\n\nAlternatively, we could go down to freeway2 at turn68? \n\nLet's try a different path: \n  turn67: D -> to y=2 at turn68.\n  turn68: then we are at freeway2 at turn68: safe (as computed earlier: [-23,-12] and [49,60] -> 0 not in).\n  then we can go up: turn68: U -> to y=3 at turn69 -> but freeway3 at turn69: unsafe.\n\n  turn67: D -> to y=2 at turn68.\n  turn68: S -> stay at y=2 at turn69: freeway2 at turn69: \n        T=69, T-67=2:\n        Car1: [-35+12*2, -24+12*2] = [-11,0] -> 0 in [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\n  turn67: D -> to y=2 at turn68.\n  turn68: U -> to y=3 at turn69: unsafe (freeway3 at turn69).\n\n  turn67: D -> to y=2 at turn68.\n  turn68: D -> to y=1 at turn69: freeway1 at turn69: \n        Freeway1: car: at T=69: [-95+48*2, -48+48*2] = [-95+96, -48+96] = [1,48] -> 0 not in? -> safe.\n        So safe.\n\n  Then at turn69: we are at y=1. Then we can go up: \n        turn69: U -> to y=2 at turn70.\n        turn70: at freeway2: check at T=70 (T-67=3):\n            Car1: [-35+12*3, -24+12*3] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n            Car2: [37+12*3,48+12*3] = [37+36,48+36] = [73,84] -> safe.\n        Then turn70: U -> to y=3 at turn71.\n        turn71: freeway3: T=71 (T-67=4):\n            Car1: [-35+12*4, -24+12*4] = [-35+48, -24+48] = [13,24] -> safe.\n            Car2: [37+12*4,48+12*4] = [37+48,48+48] = [85,96] -> safe.\n        Then turn71: U -> to y=4 at turn72.\n        turn72: freeway4: T=72 (T-67=5): car: [48-36*5,83-36*5] = [48-180,83-180] = [-132,-97] -> safe.\n        Then turn72: U -> to y=5 at turn73.\n        turn73: freeway5: same as freeway4? [48-36*6,83-36*6] = [48-216,83-216] = [-168,-133] -> safe.\n        Then turn73: U -> to y=6 at turn74.\n        turn74: freeway6: car: at T=74 (T-67=7): [-35+6*7, -24+6*7] = [-35+42, -24+42] = [7,18] -> safe.\n        Then turn74: U -> to y=7 at turn75.\n        turn75: freeway7: two cars at T=75 (T-67=8):\n            Car1: [-59+4*8, -48+4*8] = [-59+32, -48+32] = [-27, -16] -> 0 not in.\n            Car2: [5+4*8,16+4*8] = [5+32,16+32] = [37,48] -> safe.\n        Then turn75: U -> to y=8 at turn76.\n        turn76: freeway8: car: at T=76 (T-67=9): [-47+3*9, -36+3*9] = [-47+27, -36+27] = [-20, -9] -> safe.\n        Then turn76: U -> to y=9 at turn77.\n\nThis works. Total turns: from turn67 to turn77 -> 11 actions? \n  Actions: \n    turn67: D\n    turn68: D\n    turn69: U\n    turn70: U\n    turn71: U\n    turn72: U\n    turn73: U\n    turn74: U\n    turn75: U\n    turn76: U\n\nThat's 10 actions? Let me count the turns: \n  Start: turn67 at y=3.\n  After action0 (turn67): D -> at turn68, y=2.\n  action1 (turn68): D -> at turn69, y=1.\n  action2 (turn69): U -> at turn70, y=2.\n  action3 (turn70): U -> at turn71, y=3.\n  action4 (turn71): U -> at turn72, y=4.\n  action5 (turn72): U -> at turn73, y=5.\n  action6 (turn73): U -> at turn74, y=6.\n  action7 (turn74): U -> at turn75, y=7.\n  action8 (turn75): U -> at turn76, y=8.\n  action9 (turn76): U -> at turn77, y=9.\n\nSo H=10 actions? and we reach at turn77 = 67+10-1? Let me see: \n  actions: t67, t68, ... up to t76? -> 10 actions (t67 to t76) and then at turn76 we take the last action and then at turn77 we are at y=9? \n\nBut the problem: the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. And after the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we are at the goal. \n\nIn this case, after the action at turn76 (which is t1+9, since t1=67, so 67+9=76), we are at y=9? But at turn76 we are at y=8, then we do U and then at turn77 we are at y=9. But the action at turn76 is the last action (the 10th action) and then the state at turn77 is the result. \n\nThe problem says: \"at turn t1+H-1\" we are at (0,9). In this case, H=10, so t1+H-1 = 67+9 = 76. But at turn76 we are at y=8, not 9. \n\nMistake: we are at y=8 at the beginning of turn76. Then we take an action U at turn76, and that moves us to y=9 at turn77. But the problem says: after the sequence of actions, at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nBut the action at turn76 is the last action (the H-1-th action in the sequence, which is the 10th action). But after that action, we are at turn77? \n\nActually, the state update is: \n  At turn t, we are at position y_t, and we take action a_t, then we are at y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn T, we must have taken an action at turn T-1 that moved us from y=8 to y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: we want at turn t1+H-1 to be at (0,9). \n\nSo turn t1+H-1 = T, and at that turn we are at (0,9). This means that the action that got us to y=9 was taken at turn t1+H-2? \n\nLet me clarify with a small example. Suppose we start at turn0 at y0, and we take one action (H=1) then we are at turn0+H-1 = turn0? So we must start at y=9? \n\nBut that doesn't make sense. \n\nThe problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo the actions are taken at: \n  t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAnd then at turn t1+H-1, after the last action, we are at (0,9).\n\nBut note: the action at time t1+H-1 is taken at the beginning of the turn? and then the state is updated to the next turn? \n\nActually, the state at turn t1 is given. Then we take action a_{t1} and then we are at state at turn t1+1. Then we take a_{t1+1} and then we are at turn t1+2, ... until we take a_{t1+H-1} and then we are at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nThis is confusing. Let me read: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nSo the condition is: at turn (t1 + H - 1), the player is at y=9.\n\nBut how do we get there? \n\nThe actions are applied at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThe action at turn t1 determines the state at turn t1+1.\nThe action at turn t1+1 determines the state at turn t1+2.\n...\nThe action at turn t1+H-2 determines the state at turn t1+H-1.\nThe action at turn t1+H-1 determines the state at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the condition is at turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9. That means that the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is already y=9? \n\nOr after the action of that turn? \n\nLet me see the update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, where Delta y_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at the start of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we take a_t, and then we are at y_{t+1} at the start of turn t+1.\n\nThe condition is: at turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nBut that means that the state at the start of turn t1+H-1 is 9. \n\nHow did we get there? \n  We took actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., up to t1+H-2? \n\nFor example, if H=1, then we require at turn t1+1-1 = t1, we are at y_{t1}=9. But we are given that we are at y=3 at turn67. So H must be at least 6.\n\nThe minimal H without obstacles is 6: then we would be at y=9 at turn67+6-1 = turn72. \n\nHow? \n  turn67: start at y=3.\n  turn67: action0 (U) -> then at turn68: y=4.\n  turn68: action1 (U) -> turn69: y=5.\n  turn69: action2 (U) -> turn70: y=6.\n  turn70: action3 (U) -> turn71: y=7.\n  turn71: action4 (U) -> turn72: y=8.\n  turn72: action5 (U) -> turn73: y=9.\n\nBut the condition is at turn t1+H-1 = 67+6-1 = 72, we are at y=9? In this case, at turn72 we are at y=8, not 9. \n\nSo we are at y=9 at turn73, which is t1+6. But then we would require H such that t1+H-1 = 73 -> 67+H-1=73 -> H=7.\n\nWith 7 actions: \n  actions at turns67,68,69,70,71,72,73.\n  at turn73 (which is 67+7-1=73) we are at y=9.\n\nYes: \n  after action0 at turn67: turn68 -> y=4.\n  after action1 at turn68: turn69 -> y=5.\n  after action2 at turn69: turn70 -> y=6.\n  after action3 at turn70: turn71 -> y=7.\n  after action4 at turn71: turn72 -> y=8.\n  after action5 at turn72: turn73 -> y=9.\n\nAnd then we stop: we have taken 6 actions? But wait, we need 6 U's to go from 3 to 9: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9 -> 6 moves? But then we would be at y=9 at turn73, and we have taken actions at turns67 to72 (6 actions). Then H=6, but t1+H-1=67+6-1=72, and at turn72 we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nSo we need one more action to get to 9 at turn73. So H=7.\n\nTherefore, to go from y0 to y0+k, we need k actions of U, and then the state at turn t1+k is y0+k. And we require that at turn t1+H-1 = y0+k. This implies that H-1 = k? -> H = k+1.\n\nBut then we would be at y0+k at turn t1+k = t1+(H-1). \n\nSo the minimal H without obstacles is 7: because we start at 3, need to go to 9 -> difference 6, so H=7.\n\nBut in the above we saw that with 6 U's we get to 9 at turn73, which is t1+6, so if we set H=7, then t1+H-1=67+7-1=73, and at turn73 we are at y=9.\n\nSo the minimal H in the obstacle-free case is 7.\n\nBut with obstacles, it may take more.\n\nNow, in our earlier path that went down, we had 10 actions? and we reached y=9 at turn77. Then 67+H-1 =77 -> H=11.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nLet me try to find a path that takes less than 10 actions.\n\nWe need to avoid the cars on freeway3,4,5 at turn69.\n\nWhat if we are at freeway4 at turn68 (safe) and then at turn68 we do not stay at y=4, but we go up to y=5 at turn69? -> unsafe.\n\nOr we go down to y=3 at turn69 -> unsafe.\n\nOr we go up to y=5 at a later turn.\n\nWe note that freeway4 at turn70: \n  T=70, T-67=3: [48-36*3,83-36*3] = [48-108,83-108] = [-60,-25] -> safe.\n\n freeway5 at turn70: same as freeway4: [-60,-25] -> safe.\n\n freeway3 at turn70: \n   T=70, T-67=3:\n        Car1: [-35+12*3, -24+12*3] = [1,12] -> safe.\n        Car2: [37+12*3,48+12*3] = [73,84] -> safe.\n\nSo at turn70, freeways 3,4,5 are safe.\n\nTherefore, if we can be at y=5 at turn70, then safe.\n\nHow to be at y=5 at turn70? \n  We are at y=3 at turn67.\n  We need to be at y=5 at the start of turn70.\n\n  So we have turns67,68,69 to move.\n\n  We can do: \n      turn67: U -> y=4 at turn68.\n      turn68: S -> y=4 at turn69. \n      turn69: U -> y=5 at turn70.\n\n  But at turn69, we are at y=4 -> freeway4 at turn69: T=69 -> [-24,11] -> unsafe.\n\n  Alternatively:\n      turn67: S -> y=3 at turn68.\n      turn68: U -> y=4 at turn69. -> unsafe (freeway4 at turn69)\n      turn69: U -> y=5 at turn70.\n\n  Or:\n      turn67: U -> y=4 at turn68.\n      turn68: U -> y=5 at turn69. -> unsafe (freeway5 at turn69)\n\nSo none work.\n\nWhat if we are at y=6 at turn70? Then we must be at y=5 at turn69? -> unsafe.\n\nOr at y=4 at turn69 is the only way to then be at y=5 at turn70, but then we are unsafe at turn69.\n\nWe need to be at freeway4 at a safe turn. We see that freeway4 is safe at turn68 and at turn70, but not at turn69.\n\nSo if we can be at freeway4 only at turn68 and then at turn70 we are at freeway5, but we can't skip freeway4 in between.\n\nUnless we move through freeway4 in one turn and then leave before the unsafe turn? But we can't because the unsafe turn is exactly the next turn.\n\nWe could try to be at freeway4 at turn67? But we start at turn67 at y=3.\n\nOr at turn71: freeway4 is safe: T=71, T-67=4: [48-36*4,83-36*4] = [48-144,83-144] = [-96,-61] -> safe.\n\nBut then we would be delayed.\n\nLet me try to go up after turn70.\n\n We are at turn67: y=3.\n turn67: S -> turn68: y=3.\n turn68: S -> but freeway3 at turn68: safe, but at turn69: unsafe. So we cannot do two S's.\n\n turn67: S -> turn68: y=3.\n turn68: U -> turn69: y=4 (unsafe).\n\n turn67: U -> turn68: y=4.\n turn68: S -> turn69: y=4 (unsafe).\n\n turn67: U -> turn68: y=4.\n turn68: U -> turn69: y=5 (unsafe).\n\n turn67: U -> turn68: y=4.\n turn68: D -> turn69: y=3 (unsafe).\n\nThe only safe move at turn68 from y=4 is to go to y=3 or y=5 or stay, but all are unsafe at turn69.\n\n unless we can be at a safe row at turn69. The safe rows are the ones that are not freeways or freeways that are safe.\n\n The non-freeway rows are y=0 and y=9. We are at y=3 at turn67, and we can try to go to y=0.\n\n Let me check freeway1 at turn68 and turn69.\n\n freeway1: car: right-moving, segment at T: [-95+48*(T-67), -48+48*(T-67)]\n\n turn68: T=68 -> [-95+48, -48+48] = [-47,0] -> 0 in the segment? -> yes, because -47<=0<=0? -> collision.\n\n turn69: T=69 -> [-95+96, -48+96] = [1,48] -> safe.\n\n freeway2 at turn69: \n   Car1: [-35+12*2, -24+12*2] = [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n   Car2: [37+24,48+24] = [61,72] -> safe.\n\n so freeway2 at turn69 is unsafe.\n\n freeway6 at turn69: \n   car: right-moving: [-35+6*2, -24+6*2] = [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n freeway7 at turn69: \n   Car1: [-59+4*2, -48+4*2] = [-59+8, -48+8] = [-51,-40] -> safe.\n   Car2: [5+8,16+8] = [13,24] -> safe.\n\n freeway8 at turn69: \n   [-47+3*2, -36+3*2] = [-47+6, -36+6] = [-41,-30] -> safe.\n\nSo the only freeways that are unsafe at turn69 are 3,4,5 and also freeway2 and freeway1 at turn68 is unsafe.\n\nThe safe rows at turn69 are: \n  y=0: not a freeway, always safe.\n  y=1: freeway1 at turn69: safe (segment [1,48] -> 0 not in).\n  y=6: freeway6 at turn69: safe.\n  y=7: freeway7 at turn69: safe.\n  y=8: freeway8 at turn69: safe.\n  y=9: goal, safe.\n\nBut we are at y=3 or 4 at turn68, and we want to be at a safe row at turn69.\n\nFrom y=4 at turn68, we can go to y=3,4,5. But these are unsafe.\n\nFrom y=3 at turn68, we can go to y=2,3,4: and these are unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at a safe row at turn69 if we are at y=3 or 4 at turn68.\n\nWe must be at a different row at turn68. \n\nFor example, if we are at y=1 at turn68, then we can go to y=0,1,2 at turn69. \n  y=0: safe.\n  y=1: safe (freeway1 at turn69: safe).\n  y=2: unsafe (freeway2 at turn69: has a car with [-11,0]).\n\nSo from y=1 at turn68, we can go to y=0 or y=1 at turn69.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at y=5 at turn68, then we can go to y=4,5,6 at turn69. But y=4 and y=5 are unsafe. y=6 is safe.\n\nSo if we can be at y=1 or y=5 or y=6 etc. at turn68, then we can avoid.\n\nHow to be at y=1 at turn68? \n  turn67: we are at y=3. We can do D twice? \n      turn67: D -> y=2 at turn68.\n      then we are at freeway2 at turn68: safe (segment at turn68: car1: [-23,-12] -> safe, car2: [49,60] -> safe).\n      then at turn68, we can do: \n          D -> to y=1 at turn69: safe (freeway1 at turn69: safe).\n          or S -> to y=2 at turn69: unsafe.\n          or U -> to y=3 at turn69: unsafe.\n\n  turn67: D -> y=2 at turn68.\n  then at turn68: D -> y=1 at turn69: safe.\n\n  total actions so far: \n      turn67: D\n      turn68: D\n\n  then at turn69: we are at y=1.\n\n  then we can start going up.\n\n  But we are at y=1, and we want to go to y=9. We need 8 steps upward.\n\n  We have to avoid freeways at future turns.\n\n  Specifically, we need to check freeway1 at the turns we are on it, freeway2, etc.\n\n  We are at y=1 at turn69. \n      turn69: action: U -> to y=2 at turn70.\n      freeway2 at turn70: T=70, T-67=3: \n          car1: [-35+12*3, -24+12*3] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n          car2: [37+36,48+36] = [73,84] -> safe.\n      turn70: U -> to y=3 at turn71.\n      freeway3 at turn71: T=71, T-67=4: \n          car1: [-35+48, -24+48] = [13,24] -> safe.\n          car2: [37+48,48+48] = [85,96] -> safe.\n      turn71: U -> to y=4 at turn72.\n      freeway4 at turn72: T=72, T-67=5: [48-180,83-180] = [-132,-97] -> safe.\n      turn72: U -> to y=5 at turn73.\n      freeway5: same as freeway4 at turn73? T=73, T-67=6: [48-216,83-216] = [-168,-133] -> safe.\n      turn73: U -> to y=6 at turn74.\n      freeway6 at turn74: T=74, T-67=7: [-35+6*7, -24+6*7] = [7,18] -> safe.\n      turn74: U -> to y=7 at turn75.\n      freeway7 at turn75: T=75, T-67=8:\n          car1: [-59+32, -48+32] = [-27,-16] -> safe.\n          car2: [5+32,16+32] = [37,48] -> safe.\n      turn75: U -> to y=8 at turn76.\n      freeway8 at turn76: T=76, T-67=9: [-47+27, -36+27] = [-20,-9] -> safe.\n      turn76: U -> to y=9 at turn77.\n\n  So we reach y=9 at turn77.\n\n  Actions: \n      turn67: D\n      turn68: D\n      turn69: U\n      turn70: U\n      turn71: U\n      turn72: U\n      turn73: U\n      turn74: U\n      turn75: U\n      turn76: U\n\n  That's 10 actions.\n\n  Then at turn77 = 67+10-1? -> 67+10-1=76, but we are at y=9 at turn77, so we require 67+H-1=77 -> H=11.\n\n  So we need 11 actions.\n\n  Sequence: actions at turns67 to turn77-1? -> turns67 to 76 (10 actions) and then we are at turn77.\n\n  But the last action is at turn76, and then at turn77 we are at y=9. \n\n  The problem: we want at turn t1+H-1 =77 to be at (0,9). This means H-1 = 77 - t1 = 77-67=10, so H=11.\n\n  So we output 11 actions: from turn67 to turn77-1 = turn76.\n\n  But wait, the actions are for turns67,68,...,76.\n\n  And then at turn77 (which is 67+11-1=77) we are at y=9.\n\n  But the action at turn76 should be U to get from y=8 to y=9.\n\n  So the last action is at turn76: U.\n\n  Total actions: 11.\n\n  But is there a shorter path?\n\n  What if we do not go down to y=1, but go up to y=6 by turn69? \n\n  We are at y=3 at turn67.\n  turn67: U -> turn68: y=4.\n  turn68: U -> turn69: y=5 -> unsafe.\n\n  cannot.\n\n  turn67: U -> turn68: y=4.\n  turn68: U -> turn69: y=5 (unsafe) \n\n  or turn68: from y=4, we can only move to y=3,4,5.\n\n  What if we move faster? we can't.\n\n  Another idea: at turn67: U to y=4 at turn68 (safe).\n  then at turn68: we want to be at a safe haven at turn69. The only safe havens at turn69 are y=0,1,6,7,8,9.\n\n  from y=4, can we reach y=6 in one move? no.\n\n  or y=1? we would need to do three D's: from y=4 to y=1 in one move? no.\n\n  so impossible.\n\n  Therefore, the only way is to go down to y=1 and then up.\n\n  But is there a way to only go down to y=2 and then somewhere safe at turn69? \n\n  At turn68: if we are at y=2, then at turn69 we can only be at y=1,2,3. \n      y=1: safe.\n      y=2: unsafe.\n      y=3: unsafe.\n\n  so only y=1 is safe.\n\n  So we must go to y=1 at turn69.\n\n  So the path is fixed: \n      turn67: D (from 3 to 2)\n      turn68: D ( from 2 to 1)\n      turn69: we are at y=1, and then we go up from there.\n\n  But then we have to go up 8 steps: from y=1 to y=9.\n\n  That takes 8 steps: \n      turn69: U -> y=2 at turn70.\n      turn70: U -> y=3 at turn71.\n      turn71: U -> y=4 at turn72.\n      turn72: U -> y=5 at turn73.\n      turn73: U -> y=6 at turn74.\n      turn74: U -> y=7 at turn75.\n      turn75: U -> y=8 at turn76.\n      turn76: U -> y=9 at turn77.\n\n  So actions: \n      turn67: D\n      turn68: D\n      turn69: U\n      turn70: U\n      turn71: U\n      turn72: U\n      turn73: U\n      turn74: U\n      turn75: U\n      turn76: U\n\n  That's 10 actions, and we reach y=9 at turn77.\n\n  So H=11 because 67+H-1=77 -> H=77-67+1=11.\n\n  But let me count the actions: \n      action0: turn67: D\n      action1: turn68: D\n      action2: turn69: U\n      action3: turn70: U\n      action4: turn71: U\n      action5: turn72: U\n      action6: turn73: U\n      action7: turn74: U\n      action8: turn75: U\n      action9: turn76: U\n\n  That's 10 actions, which is H=10, but then the last turn is turn76 = 67+10-1=76, and at turn76 we are at y=8, not 9.\n\n  We are at y=9 at turn77, so we require the state at turn77. Therefore, we need to set H such that 67+H-1=77 -> H=11.\n\n  So we need to include one more action? But we have already used 10 actions.\n\n  The action at turn76: U -> then at turn77: y=9.\n\n  So the actions are from turn67 to turn76: 10 actions? and then at turn77 we are at y=9.\n\n  The condition is: at turn t1+H-1 =77, we are at y=9. This means that H-1 = 77-67 = 10, so H=11.\n\n  Therefore, we must have 11 actions. \n\n  But with 10 actions, we cover turns67 to76, and then at turn77 we are at y=9. \n\n  The last action is at turn76. Do we need an action at turn77? \n\n  The problem does not require an action after reaching the goal. We only output actions until we reach the goal.\n\n  But the condition is that at turn67+H-1 we are at y=9. \n\n  In our case, at turn77 we are at y=9, and 77 = 67+10, so 67+H-1 =67+10 -> H-1=10 -> H=11.\n\n  But we have only taken 10 actions. \n\n  How can this be? \n\n  Let me clarify the indexing.\n\n  Let t = t1 + i, for i=0 to H-1.\n\n  We take action a_{t1+i} at turn (t1+i), and then the next state is at turn (t1+i+1).\n\n  We want at turn (t1+H-1) to be at y=9.\n\n  If we take 0 actions (H=1), then we are at turn67 and we require y_{67}=9, but we are at 3.\n\n  If we take one action (H=2), then we take action at turn67, and then at turn68 we are at some y, and we require at turn67+2-1= turn68, y=9.\n\n  In general, after taking actions at turns67,68,...,67+H-1, the state at turn67+H is set.\n\n  But the condition is for turn67+H-1.\n\n  So to be at y=9 at turn67+H-1, that means that the last action we took was at turn67+H-2, which moved us to y=9 at turn67+H-1.\n\n  Therefore, we do not take an action at turn67+H-1.\n\n  In our case, we want to be at y=9 at turn77. \n      turn77 = 67+H-1  => H = 77 - 67 + 1 = 11.\n\n  We then take actions at turns67,68,...,76 ( which is 10 actions: from i=0 to i=10-1? -> i=0..9 -> 10 actions).\n\n  The last action is at turn76, and that action (U) moves us from y=8 at turn76 to y=9 at turn77.\n\n  So the sequence has 11-1=10 actions? \n\n  But the problem says: the sequence has H actions: from t=0 to H-1.\n\n  So for H=11, we have actions for t=0 to 10 -> 11 actions. \n\n  This is a contradiction.\n\n  Let me read the problem: \n      \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\n  and then at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9).\n\n  The number of actions is H.\n\n  In our case, to be at (0,9) at turn77, we need to have taken actions at turns67,68,...,76? that's 10 actions: turns67 to76 is 10 turns (67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76).\n\n  So H=10, and then turn67+10-1 =76, but we are at y=9 at turn77, not turn76.\n\n  Alternatively, if we output 11 actions, then the last action would be at turn77, and then at turn78 we are at y=10? but we can't go above 9.\n\n  Clearly, there is a mismatch.\n\n  Let me example with small example.\n\n  Suppose we are at y=8 at turn67, and we want to get to y=9.\n      We need one action: U at turn67.\n      Then at turn68, we are at y=9.\n      We want at turn67+H-1 =68 to be at y=9.\n      So 67+H-1=68 -> H=2.\n      We output two actions? but we only need one.\n\n  The problem says: minimize H, the number of turns? and the sequence has H actions.\n\n  In the small example, we would output:\n        Turn 67: U\n        Turn 68: ? \n\n  But we only need one action.\n\n  The indexing: {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\n\n  For H=2, t=0 and t=1: \n        a_{67} and a_{68}\n\n  But after a_{67} we are at y=9 at turn68. Then a_{68} is not needed.\n\n  So the problem must allow that we may not need to take all H actions if we reach earlier? \n\n  But the condition is: after taking the sequence of actions, at turn67+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\n  In the small example, with H=2, we are at turn67+2-1=68, and we want to be at y=9 at turn68. We can do:\n        a_{67} = U -> then at turn68: y=9.\n        and a_{68} can be anything? but the problem is to reach exactly at that turn.\n\n  But the minimal H in this case should be 1: \n        if H=1, then we are at turn67+1-1=67, and we want y_{67}=9, but we are at 8.\n\n  so we need H=2.\n\n  But then we are outputting an extra action.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence.\n\n  In the small example, the minimal H is 2, and the sequence is two actions? but the second action is not necessary.\n\n  But we can set the second action to S or U or D? but if we set to U and we are at y=9, then we try to go to y=10, but that is clamped to 9. \n\n  The update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, but then clamped to [0,9]. \n\n  So if we are at y=9 and do U, we stay at 9.\n\n  So we can set the second action to S or U or D, it doesn't matter.\n\n  In our case, for the original problem, if we use the path we have and then at the last action we are at y=9, then the subsequent actions can be arbitrary, but we only need to output until we reach at the required turn.\n\n  But the problem requires to output exactly the actions from turn67 to turn67+H-1.\n\n  And we require that at turn67+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\n  In our path, at turn76 we are at y=8, and we do U at turn76 to get to y=9 at turn77.\n\n  And we want to be at y=9 at turn77 =67+11-1=77.\n\n  So H=11.\n\n  We then output 11 actions: for turns67 to77? -> that would be turns67,68,...,77. But that's 11 actions.\n\n  But the last action at turn77 would be after we are already at y=9? and then we would be at turn78 at y=9 or 10? \n\n  Let me see: \n      At turn77, we are at y=9 (because of the action at turn76).\n      Then we take action a_{77} at turn77, and that might change it.\n\n  But the condition is only for turn77: we are at y=9 at turn77, but we are also taking an action at turn77.\n\n  The condition does not require that we stay at y=9 after the action, only that at turn77 we are at y=9.\n\n  However, the state at the start of turn77 is y=9. Then we take an action a_{77} and then at turn78 we are at y_{78} = y_{77} + Delta.\n\n  The problem: \"at turn t1+H-1 =77, we are at (0,9)\" -> that means at the beginning of turn77 we are at y=9? or after the action? \n\n  The problem says: \"at turn t1+H-1\", and turn is the time.\n\n  In the game dynamics, the state at the beginning of turn t is y_t.\n\n  So at the beginning of turn77, we are at y=9.\n\n  How did we get there? \n      By the action at turn76: which moved us from turn76 to turn77.\n\n  So the action at turn76 is the only one that moved us to y=9 at turn77.\n\n  Then we do not need an action at turn77.\n\n  Therefore, we only output actions up to turn76.\n\n  So the sequence is for turns67 to76: 10 actions.\n\n  then at turn77 = 67+10, we are at y=9.\n\n  then we require that 67+H-1 =77 -> H=11.\n\n  But then we only have 10 actions in the sequence.\n\n  This is the indexing: \n      The sequence has H actions: indexed t=0 to H-1.\n      The actions are taken at turns: t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n      The state after the last action is at turn t1+H.\n      But we require the state at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9).\n\n  In our case, we want the state at turn77 to be (0,9), so t1+H-1 =77 -> 67+H-1=77 -> H=11.\n  Then the actions are at turns67 to67+10=77? -> turn77 is included.\n\n  But we only need actions up to turn76 to get to y=9 at turn77.\n\n  So for the action at turn77: we are already at y=9 at the beginning of turn77. We can set a_{77} to S, for example.\n\n  Then the state at turn78 will still be 9, but we don't care.\n\n  So we can do:\n      actions from turn67 to turn76: 10 actions as above.\n      and then at turn77: we output an action, say 'S'.\n\n  Then the sequence has 11 actions.\n\n  Therefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\n  So the answer is 11 actions.\n\n  But is there a path with H<11? \n\n  We have to achieve y=9 at turn77 or earlier. \n\n  The direct path in 7 actions would get to y=9 at turn73, but we cannot because of the cars.\n\n  Can we achieve it at an earlier turn than 77? \n\n  For example, can we be at y=9 at turn76? \n\n  To be at y=9 at turn76, we would have to be at y=8 at turn75 and then do U.\n\n  But to be at y=8 at turn75, we need to have been at y=7 at turn74, etc.\n\n  We know that freeway5 is only safe after turn69 (at turn70 it becomes safe). \n\n  The soonest we can be at y=5 is turn70.\n\n  Then the earliest we can be at y=9 is turn74: \n      turn70: y=5\n      turn71: y=6\n      turn72: y=7\n      turn73: y=8\n      turn74: y=9\n\n  So at turn74, we are at y=9.\n\n  Therefore, we want to be at y=9 at turn74.\n\n  We are at y=3 at turn67.\n\n  We have turns67,68,69,70,71,72,73 to get to y=9.\n\n  We need to be at y=5 at turn70.\n\n  How to get from y=3 at turn67 to y=5 at turn70 without being in an unsafe freeway in between.\n\n  We must pass through freeway3,4,5.\n\n  We know freeway3 and freeway4 are safe at turn70, freeway5 at turn70 is safe.\n\n  But we must be on freeway3 at some turn, freeway4 at some turn, freeway5 at some turn.\n\n  The constraints are:\n      turn69: freeway3,4,5 are unsafe.\n\n  We cannot be on freeway3,4,5 at turn69.\n\n  We can try:\n      turn67: U -> y=4 at turn68 (freeway4 at turn68: safe)\n      turn68: S -> then at turn69: y=4 (freeway4: unsafe) -> not allowed.\n\n      turn67: U -> y=4 at turn68.\n      turn68: U -> turn69: y=5 (freeway5: unsafe) -> not allowed.\n\n      turn67: U -> y=4 at turn68.\n      turn68: D -> turn69: y=3 (freeway3: unsafe) -> not allowed.\n\n      turn67: S -> turn68: y=3.\n      turn68: U -> turn69: y=4 ( unsafe) -> not allowed.\n\n  So we cannot be at a freeway in {3,4,5} at turn69.\n\n  What if we are at freeway3 at turn67 and turn68, and then skip turn69 for these freeways by being at a different row at turn69.\n\n  For example, if we are at y=6 at turn69, then safe.\n\n  How to be at y=6 at turn69? \n      from turn67: \n          turn67: U -> y=4 at turn68.\n          turn68: U -> y=5 at turn69: then we are at freeway5: unsafe.\n\n      turn67: U -> y=4 at turn68.\n          then at turn68: we need to go to y=6 in one move? impossible.\n\n      turn67: two U's in a row: \n          turn67: U -> turn68: y=4.\n          turn68: U -> turn69: y=5: unsafe.\n\n  So we cannot be at y=6 at turn69.\n\n  Therefore, we must be at a safe row at turn69 that is not in {3,4,5}. The safe rows at turn69 are y=0,1,6,7,8,9.\n\n  We are at y=3 at turn67.\n\n  To be at y=6 at turn69, we would need to do three U's in two turns: from 3 to 6 in two actions: 3->4->5->6: but that's two actions to move two steps? no, we can only move one per action. \n        3 ->4 (1 action) then 4->5 (second action) -> that's only to 5.\n\n  To get to 6, we need three actions: 3->4->5->6.\n\n  So in two actions (from turn67 to turn68 and turn68 to turn69) we can only get to y=5.\n\n  Similarly, to get to y=1 at turn69, we need two D's: \n          turn67: D -> y=2 at turn68.\n          turn68: D -> y=1 at turn69.\n\n  This is safe.\n\n  Then from y=1 at turn69, we can start going up. But to be at y=5 at turn70, we would need to do four U's in one move? from y=1 to y=5 in one action? no.\n\n  The soonest we can be at y=5 from y=1 is turn73: \n          turn69: y=1.\n          turn70: y=2.\n          turn71: y=3.\n          turn72: y=4.\n          turn73: y=5.\n          turn74: y=6.\n          turn75: y=7.\n          turn76: y=8.\n          turn77: y=9.\n\n  This is the same as before.\n\n  from y=1 at turn69, to y=5 at turn73: that's 4 steps: 1->2->3->4->5.\n\n  then to 9: 5->6->7->8->9: 4 more steps, so total from turn69 to turn77: 8 steps.\n\n  turn69 is the third turn (actions taken at turn67 and turn68 to get to y=1 at turn69).\n\n  So total turns from start: \n        actions at turn67, turn68: to get to turn69 at y=1.\n        then actions at turn69 to turn76: to get to turn77 at y=9.\n        that's 10 actions: turn67 to turn76.\n\n  and then at turn77 we are at y=9.\n\n  so H=11.\n\n  Therefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\n  So we output 11 actions.\n\n  The sequence is:\n\n  turn67: D\n  turn68: D\n  turn69: U\n  turn70: U\n  turn71: U\n  turn72: U\n  turn73: U\n  turn74: U\n  turn75: U\n  turn76: U\n  turn77: ? \n\n  But we are at y=9 at turn77, and we need an action for turn77. We can choose 'S'.\n\n  So the last action is S.\n\n  Therefore, the sequence is:\n\n  Turn 67: D\n  Turn 68: D\n  Turn 69: U\n  Turn 70: U\n  Turn 71: U\n  Turn 72: U\n  Turn 73: U\n  Turn 74: U\n  Turn 75: U\n  Turn 76: U\n  Turn 77: S\n\n  But is this valid? \n      At turn77: we are at y=9 (from the action at turn76: U from y=8 at turn76 to y=9 at turn77).\n      Then at turn77, we take action S, and then at turn78 we are still at y=9.\n\n      The condition only requires that at turn77 (67+11-1=77) we are at (0,9). \n          At the beginning of turn77, we are at y=9. Then we take action S, and then at turn78 we are at y=9, but that's fine.\n\n  However, the condition for collision: at turn77, we are on freeway? no, y=9 is not a freeway. So no collision.\n\n  Therefore, it is safe.\n\n  So the minimal H is 11.\n\n  But is there a path with H=10? \n      If H=10, then we require at turn67+10-1=76 to be at y=9.\n      To be at y=9 at turn76, we must have been at y=8 at turn75 and then done U at turn75.\n      So we are at y=8 at turn75.\n      How to be at y=8 at turn75? \n          We must have been at y=7 at turn74, etc.\n\n      The earliest we can be at y=5 is turn70.\n      Then turn71: y=6\n      turn72: y=7\n      turn73: y=8\n      turn74: y=9 -> this is for turn74.\n      But we want to be at y=9 at turn76, which is later, but we can be there earlier.\n\n      However, the condition is to be there at turn76.\n\n      But we can be there at turn74.\n\n      So for H=8? then turn67+8-1=74, so we want to be at y=9 at turn74.\n\n      How to be at y=9 at turn74 from y=3 at turn67 in 7 actions (H=8 actions) and avoid all cars.\n\n      We need to be at y=5 at turn70.\n\n      then turn70: y=5 (safe, because freeway5 at turn70: safe)\n      turn71: U -> y=6 (freeway6 at turn71: T=71, T-67=4: car: [-35+6*4, -24+6*4] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> 0 in the segment! -> unsafe.\n\n      Oh, freeway6 at turn71 is unsafe.\n\n      freeway6 car: right-moving, at T=71: \n          segment: [-35+6*(71-67), -24+6*(71-67)] = [-35+6*4, -24+24] = [-35+24,0] = [-11,0] -> contains 0.\n\n      So unsafe.\n\n      What about turn72 for freeway6?

The initial position at turn 67 is \\(y = 3\\), and the goal is to be at \\(y = 9\\) at turn 77 (since \\(67 + 11 - 1 = 77\\)). The sequence of actions minimizes the number of turns \\(H = 11\\) and ensures no collisions occur on any freeway during the path.\n\nThe sequence is as follows:\n- At turn 67, move down to \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as freeway 3 at turn 67 is clear).\n- At turn 68, move down to \\(y = 1\\) (safe, as freeway 2 at turn 68 is clear).\n- At turn 69, move up to \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as freeway 1 at turn 69 is clear).\n- At turn 70, move up to \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as freeway 2 at turn 70 is clear).\n- At turn 71, move up to \\(y = 4\\) (safe, as freeway 3 at turn 71 is clear).\n- At turn 72, move up to \\(y = 5\\) (safe, as freeway 4 at turn 72 is clear).\n- At turn 73, move up to \\(y = 6\\) (safe, as freeway 5 at turn 73 is clear).\n- At turn 74, move up to \\(y = 7\\) (safe, as freeway 6 at turn 74 is clear).\n- At turn 75, move up to \\(y = 8\\) (safe, as freeway 7 at turn 75 is clear).\n- At turn 76, move up to \\(y = 9\\) (safe, as freeway 8 at turn 76 is clear).\n- At turn 77, stay (since \\(y = 9\\) is reached and not a freeway, any action is safe; 'S' is chosen).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 77 (i.e., \\(67 + 11 - 1\\)) with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 67: D \\\\\nTurn 68: D \\\\\nTurn 69: U \\\\\nTurn 70: U \\\\\nTurn 71: U \\\\\nTurn 72: U \\\\\nTurn 73: U \\\\\nTurn 74: U \\\\\nTurn 75: U \\\\\nTurn 76: U \\\\\nTurn 77: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,0) at turn 69 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe collision rule is important: collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y_T and at that turn, for the car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span. The note says that when you move to a new y, you're not on that new row until the next turn. So if you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you're still on y_T during turn T, and only on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe car positions are given for turn t_1 = 69. For each car, I have head, tail, direction, and speed. The span is defined based on direction: for left-moving, head is left, tail is right? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ], and at time T, it becomes [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]. Similarly for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h] and becomes [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)].\n\nI think there might be a inconsistency in notation. Let me parse this.\n\nFor left-moving cars: at t_1, span is [h, τ], meaning from h to τ, and since it's left-moving, h decreases over time. In the update, h - sΔT, τ - sΔT, so both decrease, meaning the car is moving left, so the head is the front when moving left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span is [τ, h], and at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so both increase, so for right-moving, τ is the tail and h is the head, I think.\n\nIn the left-moving case, [h, τ] with h and τ, and h - sΔT, τ - sΔT, so if h < τ, then it's from left to right? But if it's moving left, the coordinates should decrease.\n\nI think I need to interpret the span.\n\nAssume that the road is a number line, and position 0 is the point we care about for collision.\n\nFor a left-moving car, at t_1, the span covers from h to τ, and as time increases, both h and τ decrease by s per turn, so the whole car moves left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span is from τ to h, and both increase by s per turn.\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" and \"Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\", so if τ and h are numbers, and it's moving right, so τ should be the left end and h the right end at t_1.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h and τ, and moving left, so h might be the right end and τ the left end? But it says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\", but in the context, for left-moving, head is h, tail is τ, and both decrease.\n\nBut in terms of the span, for collision, we care about whether 0 is in [min, max] of the span at time T.\n\nFor a left-moving car, at time T, span is [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], and since it's moving left, if h > τ, then [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] with h - sΔT decreasing, τ - sΔT decreasing, but if h > τ, then min is τ - sΔT, max is h - sΔT, so span is [min, max] = [τ - sΔT, h - sΔT].\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span at T is [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so min is τ + sΔT, max is h + sΔT.\n\nAnd collision if y_T = k and 0 is in the span of the car on freeway k at time T.\n\nAlso, note that for each freeway, there might be multiple cars, so I need to check all cars on the row when the player is there.\n\nNow, player starts at y=0 at turn 69. y=0 is not a freeway, I think freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0, no cars, so it's safe. Similarly, y=9 might be safe, but the goal is (0,9), so when at y=9, no cars I assume, since freeways are 1-8.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8\", so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer position is given as (0, y_t), so x is always 0, I think, we only care about y-position and time.\n\nThe grid is 2D, but player is always at x=0, and cars are on the rows, but their positions are on the x-axis, I think.\n\nCars are on specific y-levels, and for each, we have their span on the x-axis.\n\nCollision is only when player is at x=0 and on the same y as a car, and 0 is within the car's x-span at that time.\n\nSo for each freeway row, at each time, I need to know if there is a car covering x=0.\n\nSince the player moves in y, and time passes, I need to simulate the car movements over time from t_1=69.\n\nLet ΔT = T - 69, so for time T, ΔT = T - 69.\n\nFor each car, given its state at t_1, I can find its span at time T.\n\nLet's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway k=1: one car: head h=-48, tail τ=-95, direction right, speed s=48.\n\nDirection right, so right-moving, so span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-95, -48]? From the notation: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" so min τ, max h? [τ, h] might imply τ to h, so if τ < h, it's from τ to h.\n\nIn this case, τ=-95, h=-48, so τ < h since -95 < -48, so span is from -95 to -48.\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-95 + 48ΔT, -48 + 48ΔT]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, different.\n\nBut in the car state, for k=1, it's right-moving, s=48.\n\nNow freeway k=2: two cars: (48, 37, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head h=48, tail τ=37? But for right-moving, span is [τ, h], so if τ=37, h=48, so [37,48] at t_1.\n\nThen at T, [37 + 12ΔT, 48 + 12ΔT]\n\nSecond car: h=0, τ=-11, right-moving, so span [τ, h] = [-11, 0] at t_1.\n\nAt T, [-11 + 12ΔT, 0 + 12ΔT] = [-11 + 12ΔT, 12ΔT]\n\nSimilarly, freeway k=3: same as k=2? (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12), identical to k=2.\n\nFreeway k=4: (48,83,left,36) — left-moving, so for left-moving, span at t_1 is [h, τ] = [48,83]? h=48, τ=83, so [48,83], and since left-moving, at T, [48 - 36ΔT, 83 - 36ΔT]\n\nBut if h=48, τ=83, and moving left, so the span is decreasing, min 48 -36ΔT, max 83-36ΔT? Since 48<83, min=48-36ΔT, max=83-36ΔT.\n\nFreeway k=5: same as k=4, (48,83,left,36)\n\nFreeway k=6: (-48,-59,right,6) — right-moving, h=-48, τ=-59, so for right-moving, span [τ,h] = [-59,-48] at t_1, since τ=-59, h=-48, τ<h.\n\nAt T, [-59 +6ΔT, -48 +6ΔT]\n\nFreeway k=7: (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4) — similar to k=2 but speed 4.\n\nFirst car: [37,48] at t_1, at T [37+4ΔT,48+4ΔT]\n\nSecond car: [-11,0] at t_1, at T [-11+4ΔT, 4ΔT]\n\nFreeway k=8: (-48,-59,right,3) — similar to k=6 but speed 3.\n\nSpan at t_1 [τ,h] = [-59,-48], at T [-59+3ΔT, -48+3ΔT]\n\nNow, for each freeway, at each time, I need to see if x=0 is covered by any car on that row.\n\nThat is, for a given k and T, if min <= 0 <= max for some car on row k.\n\nPlayer is on row y at time T, collision if y between 1 and 8, and 0 in span for that y at T.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at T=69. y=0 is safe.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9.\n\nI need to choose a sequence of actions: U, D, S, to change y, with y bounded, so from 0, I can go to 1 or stay at 0.\n\nSince I want to minimize turns, I should go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nThe minimal number of turns to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 turns, all U, but I might have to wait or detour if there are cars.\n\nBut I can only move vertically, no horizontal movement, so I have to pass through each row at some time, but I can stay or move down to avoid being on a row when a car is at 0.\n\nFor example, if at time T, row y has a car at 0, I should not be on y at that time; I can be on a different row, or move to another row.\n\nBut when I move, at the turn I move, I am still on the previous row.\n\nLet me denote time starting from t=69.\n\nAt time t=69: player at y=0.\n\nI need to find actions for t=69,70,71,... until I reach y=9.\n\ny_t is position after action at time t? Let's see the update.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on action a_t.\n\nSo at time t, action a_t is taken, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position is given for turn t_1, which is (0, y_{t_1}), and we start at t_1=69, y=0.\n\nSo at time 69, position is (0,0).\n\nThen action a_{69} determines y_{70} = y_{69} + Δy_{69}.\n\nThen at time 70, position is (0, y_{70}), and so on.\n\nCollision occurs at time T if when the player is at position (0, y_T), and y_T between 1 and 8, and for the car on freeway y_T, 0 is in the span at time T.\n\nThe note: if you move to a new y at time T, you are not on that new y until time T+1.\n\nFor example, if at time T, you are on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1} = y_T +1, then at time T, you are on y_T, so collision check on y_T at time T.\n\nAt time T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, collision check on y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nIf you stay, y_{T+1} = y_T, so you are on the same row at T and T+1.\n\nIf you move down, similar.\n\nNow, I need to find when each freeway has a car at x=0.\n\nThat is, for each row k=1 to 8, find times T when 0 is in the span for some car on row k.\n\nThen, for the player to be safe at time T on row y_T, if y_T = k, then T should not be a time when row k has a car at 0.\n\nIf y_T =0 or 9, no problem.\n\nSince I start at 0, and want to reach 9, I need to go through rows 1 to 8 at some times.\n\nBut I can be on a row at multiple times, or skip some if I move fast, but I have to visit each row at least once? No, I can go from 0 to 1 to 2... to 9, or I can go up and down, but since I want min turns, I should go directly up, but avoid the collision times.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up as much as possible, but wait when necessary.\n\nSince I can move down, I might go to a row earlier or later to avoid the car.\n\nBut the car positions change with time, so the unsafe times are different for each row.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row k, the set of times T when it is unsafe, i.e., some car covers x=0.\n\nThen for the player path, for each time T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, then T must not be in the unsafe set for row y_T.\n\ny_T is the position at time T, which is determined by the actions.\n\nT is the time index.\n\nLet me define the unsafe intervals for each row.\n\nFor each freeway k, and for each car on it, find when 0 is in its span.\n\nThen the row is unsafe if any car has 0 in span.\n\nStart with k=1.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, right-moving, span at T: [ -95 + 48ΔT, -48 + 48ΔT ] with ΔT = T - 69\n\n0 in span if min <= 0 <= max, so -95 +48ΔT <= 0 <= -48 +48ΔT\n\nSolve inequalities:\n\nFirst, -95 +48ΔT <= 0 => 48ΔT <= 95 => ΔT <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so ΔT <= 1 since ΔT integer? T is turn, so integer, ΔT integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -48 +48ΔT => 48 <= 48ΔT => ΔT >= 1\n\nAnd -95 +48ΔT <= 0 <= -48 +48ΔT\n\nFrom 0 <= -48 +48ΔT => 48ΔT >= 48 => ΔT >=1\n\nFrom -95 +48ΔT <= 0 => 48ΔT <= 95 => ΔT <= 95/48 = 1.979, so ΔT <=1 since integer.\n\nSo for ΔT=1, min = -95 +48(1) = -47, max = -48 +48 = 0? ΔT=1, T=70\n\nAt T=70, ΔT=1, min = -95 +48*1 = -47, max = -48 +48*1 = 0\n\nSo span [ -47, 0 ], so 0 is included, since max=0.\n\nSimilarly, at ΔT=0, T=69, min=-95, max=-48, 0 not in [-95,-48] since -48<0? -48 <0, so 0 > max, not in.\n\nAt ΔT=1, T=70, min=-47, max=0, so 0 <=0, so 0 in span.\n\nAt ΔT=2, T=71, min=-95+96=1, max=-48+96=48, min=1>0, so 0 not in [1,48].\n\nSo for k=1, unsafe only at T=70.\n\nNow freeway k=2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) — right-moving, span at t_1: [τ,h] = [37,48], at T: [37+12ΔT, 48+12ΔT]\n\n0 in span? 37+12ΔT <= 0 <= 48+12ΔT\n\nBut 37+12ΔT >=37 >0 for ΔT>=0, so min >0, so 0 never <= min, so 0 not in span for this car.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) — h=0, τ=-11, right-moving, span at t_1: [τ,h] = [-11,0], at T: [-11+12ΔT, 0+12ΔT] = [-11+12ΔT, 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if min <=0<= max, so -11+12ΔT <=0 and 0<=12ΔT\n\nFrom 0<=12ΔT, since ΔT integer >=0, always true for ΔT>=0? 12ΔT >=0, yes.\n\n-11+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=11 => ΔT <= 11/12 <1, so ΔT <=0 since integer.\n\nΔT=0: -11+0 = -11 <=0 <=0, 0<=0 true, min=-11<=0, so yes.\n\nΔT=1: min=-11+12=1, max=12, min=1>0, 0 not <= min.\n\nSo only at ΔT=0, T=69, unsafe for this car.\n\nBut row k=2 has two cars, so unsafe if either car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst car never, second car at T=69.\n\nSo k=2 unsafe at T=69.\n\nSimilarly, freeway k=3: same as k=2, so unsafe at T=69.\n\nNow k=4: (48,83,left,36) — left-moving.\n\nFor left-moving, span at t_1: [h,τ] = [48,83], and at T: [48 -36ΔT, 83 -36ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 48-36ΔT <= 0 <= 83-36ΔT\n\nFirst, 48-36ΔT <=0 => 48<=36ΔT => ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so ΔT >=2\n\nSecond, 0 <= 83-36ΔT => 36ΔT <=83 => ΔT <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so ΔT <=2\n\nNow, ΔT >=2 and ΔT <=2, so only ΔT=2.\n\nAt ΔT=2, min=48-72= -24, max=83-72=11, so -24 <=0<=11, yes.\n\nAt ΔT=1, min=48-36=12, max=83-36=47, both >0, 0 not in [12,47]\n\nAt ΔT=3, min=48-108= -60, max=83-108= -25, both <0, 0 not in.\n\nSo k=4 unsafe only at T=69 +2 =71.\n\nSimilarly, k=5 same as k=4, unsafe at T=71.\n\nNow k=6: (-48,-59,right,6) — right-moving.\n\nh=-48, τ=-59, span at t_1: [τ,h] = [-59,-48], at T: [-59+6ΔT, -48+6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -59+6ΔT <=0 <= -48+6ΔT\n\nFirst, -59+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=59 => ΔT <= 59/6 ≈9.833, so ΔT <=9\n\nSecond, 0 <= -48+6ΔT => 48 <=6ΔT => ΔT >= 48/6=8\n\nSo ΔT >=8 and ΔT <=9\n\nΔT=8: min=-59+48= -11, max=-48+48=0, so -11<=0<=0, yes.\n\nΔT=9: min=-59+54= -5, max=-48+54=6, so -5<=0<=6, yes.\n\nΔT=10: min=-59+60=1, max=-48+60=12, min=1>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe for T=69+8=77 and T=69+9=78.\n\nk=7: two cars, speed 4.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) span [37+4ΔT,48+4ΔT], min>0, always, so never unsafe.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,4) span [-11+4ΔT, 4ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -11+4ΔT <=0 and 0<=4ΔT\n\n0<=4ΔT always for ΔT>=0\n\n-11+4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=11 => ΔT <= 11/4=2.75, so ΔT <=2\n\nΔT=0: min=-11<=0<=0, yes\n\nΔT=1: min=-11+4= -7<=0<=4, yes? max=4ΔT, at ΔT=1, max=4, min=-7, -7<=0<=4 yes\n\n0<=4ΔT true, and min<=0.\n\n-11+4ΔT <=0 <=4ΔT\n\nAt ΔT=0: -11 <=0 <=0, 0<=0 true, -11<=0 true.\n\nAt ΔT=1: -11+4= -7 <=0 <=4, yes.\n\nAt ΔT=2: -11+8= -3 <=0 <=8, yes.\n\nAt ΔT=3: -11+12=1, max=12, min=1>0, 0 not <= min, so not.\n\nSo for second car, unsafe for ΔT=0,1,2, T=69,70,71.\n\nFirst car never unsafe, so k=7 unsafe at T=69,70,71.\n\nk=8: (-48,-59,right,3) span at T: [-59+3ΔT, -48+3ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -59+3ΔT <=0 <= -48+3ΔT\n\nFirst, -59+3ΔT <=0 => 3ΔT <=59 => ΔT <=59/3≈19.666, ΔT<=19\n\nSecond, 0 <= -48+3ΔT => 48<=3ΔT => ΔT >=16\n\nSo ΔT >=16 and ΔT <=19\n\nΔT=16: min=-59+48= -11, max=-48+48=0, -11<=0<=0 yes\n\nΔT=17: min=-59+51= -8, max=-48+51=3, -8<=0<=3 yes\n\nΔT=18: min=-59+54= -5, max=-48+54=6, yes\n\nΔT=19: min=-59+57= -2, max=-48+57=9, yes\n\nΔT=20: min=-59+60=1, max=-48+60=12, min=1>0, no\n\nSo unsafe T=69+16=85 to T=69+19=88.\n\nNow, summarize unsafe times for each row:\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=70\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=69\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=69\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=71\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=71\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=77,78\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=69,70,71\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=85,86,87,88\n\nPlayer starts at T=69, y=0.\n\nAt T=69, position y=0, safe since not on freeway.\n\nAction a_{69} determines y_{70}.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some time, say T_end, with y_{T_end} =9.\n\nMinimize the number of turns, so min H such that from t=69 to t=69+H-1, actions, and position at t=69+H-1 is y=9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=t_1 to t_1+H-1, so H actions, and after H actions, y_{t_1 + H} =9? No.\n\nStart: at time t_1, position y_{t_1} =0.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 +1}, y_{t_1 +2}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{t_1 + H}, and we want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThe turn when position is first 9 is at time t_1 + H, after H actions.\n\nBut we need to specify actions from t=t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, after 0 actions, at t_1, y=0.\n\nAfter 1 action, at t_1+1, y could be 1 or 0.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nAnd we need to avoid collision at all times from t_1 to t_1 + H -1? At time T, position y_T, collision check.\n\nAt time t_1, y_{t_1}=0, safe.\n\nAt time t_1+1, y_{t_1+1}, and so on, up to time t_1 + H -1, position y_{t_1 + H -1}, and at time t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}=9.\n\nAt time t_1 + H, if y_{t_1 + H} =9, which is not a freeway, so no collision, so we don't need to check collision at time t_1 + H, only from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe position at time t_1 + H is the goal, and since y=9, no car, so safe.\n\nNow, for times T from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, if y_T between 1 and 8, it must be safe at that time.\n\ny_T is the position at time T.\n\nAt T=t_1, y_T=0, safe.\n\nFor T>t_1, y_T depends on previous actions.\n\nI need to choose actions so that for each T, when y_T = k for k=1-8, T not in unsafe times for k.\n\nSince I start at y=0, I can go up to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H is at least 9, since I need to increase y from 0 to 9, each U increases by 1, so min 9 U actions, but I might have S or D, which add turns, so to minimize H, I should avoid S and D if possible, and go up directly.\n\nBut I have to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nList the unsafe times for each row:\n\ny=1: unsafe only at T=70\n\ny=2: unsafe only at T=69\n\ny=3: unsafe only at T=69\n\ny=4: unsafe only at T=71\n\ny=5: unsafe only at T=71\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=77,78\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=69,70,71\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=85,86,87,88\n\nNow, at T=69, y=0 safe.\n\nIf I go up at T=69, a_{69}=U, then y_{70} = 0 +1 =1\n\nAt T=70, position y=1, but y=1 is unsafe at T=70, so collision.\n\nIf I stay at T=69, a_{69}=S, then y_{70}=0, position at T=70 is y=0, safe.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince y=2 and y=3 are unsafe at T=69 only, but at T=69 I am at y=0, so I can be on y=2 or y=3 at other times.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI should find a path that avoids being on a row when it is unsafe.\n\nStart from T=69, y=0.\n\nOption: stay or go up.\n\nIf go up at T=69, y_{70}=1, but at T=70, y=1, and y=1 unsafe at T=70, so collision, not possible.\n\nSo I cannot go up at T=69; I must stay or go down, but y=0, go down? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, Δy = -1 if D, but y=0, if D, y_{70} = 0 -1 = -1? But y must be in [0,9], so I cannot go below 0.\n\nSimilarly, cannot go above 9.\n\nSo at y=0, action D is invalid? The player update says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, y_{t+1} = max(0-1,0) or something? It says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], but it doesn't specify the bound, but since it must be in [0,9], I think if action would take it out, it stays or something? But the problem doesn't say.\n\nLook back: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where ... , y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\"\n\nIt says y_{t+1} in [0,9], but doesn't specify what happens if out of bound. I think we assume that the action is only taken if possible, or it clips.\n\nTo be safe, since y must be in [0,9], if at y=0 and D, y_{t+1} should be 0, similarly at y=9 and U, y_{t+1}=9.\n\nI think that's standard.\n\nSo at y=0, action D: Δy = -1, but y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) =0, so effectively S.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, U is like S.\n\nSo at y=0, possible actions: U or S (D same as S).\n\nSimilarly at y=9, D or S (U same as S).\n\nIn this case, at T=69, y=0, I can do S or U.\n\nBut if U, y_{70}=1, but at T=70, y=1, and unsafe, collision.\n\nSo I must do S at T=69, so y_{70}=0.\n\nAt T=70, position y=0, safe.\n\nNow, action a_{70}, I can U or S.\n\nIf I U at T=70, y_{71} = 0 +1 =1\n\nAt T=71, position y=1.\n\nNow, y=1 unsafe only at T=70, not at other times, so at T=71, y=1 should be safe.\n\nConfirm: for y=1, unsafe only at T=70, as we found.\n\nAt T=71, for k=1, ΔT=2, span min=1, max=48, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSo at T=71, y=1 is safe.\n\nIf I go to y=1 at T=71.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up.\n\nBut I also need to consider other rows.\n\nAt T=70, position y=0.\n\nIf I S, y_{71}=0, but I need to move up eventually.\n\nIf I U at T=70, y_{71}=1.\n\nAt T=71, y=1, safe as above.\n\nNow action a_{71}, I can go to y=2.\n\ny_{72} = y_{71} + Δy_{71}\n\nIf a_{71}=U, y_{72}=2.\n\nAt T=72, position y=2.\n\nNow, y=2 unsafe only at T=69, not at T=72, so should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 unsafe only at T=69.\n\nBut let's see y=7, which is unsafe at multiple times.\n\nFirst, continue.\n\nSo possible to go from y=1 to y=2 at T=72.\n\nBut I need to reach higher rows.\n\nNow, y=4 and y=5 unsafe at T=71.\n\nAt T=71, if I am on y=1, not on y=4 or 5.\n\nIf I go to y=2 at T=72, etc.\n\nBut let's list the times I can be on each row safely.\n\nFor y=1: unsafe at T=70, so safe at T≠70, e.g., T=69,71,72,... but T=69 I am at y=0, so for y=1, safe times T>=71 or T=69 but T=69 not possible since I start at 0.\n\nT=69: y=0, so for y=1, possible times T>=71.\n\nSimilarly, y=2: unsafe only T=69, so safe at T>=70? T=70,71,... except T=69.\n\nBut at T=69, I am not on y=2 anyway.\n\ny=3: similar, safe at T>=70.\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=71, so safe at T≠71, e.g., T=69,70,72,73,... \n\ny=5: similar, safe T≠71.\n\ny=6: unsafe T=77,78, so safe at T<=76 or T>=79.\n\ny=7: unsafe T=69,70,71, so safe at T>=72.\n\ny=8: unsafe T=85,86,87,88, so safe at T<=84 or T>=89.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at T=69 to y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe always.\n\nNow, the path: I need to be on each y from 1 to 8 at some safe time.\n\nBut I don't have to be on each row; I can skip rows if I move multiple steps, but I can only change by ±1 per turn, so I must pass through each integer y between 0 and 9, but not necessarily stay; I move step by step.\n\nFor example, from y=0 to y=1 to y=2, etc., or I could go to y=1 then back to y=0, but that wastes turns.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should go directly up without down or stay, if possible.\n\nBut I may need to stay to avoid unsafe times.\n\nNow, from above, at T=69, y=0, I must S or D, but D same as S, so S.\n\nSo a_{69} = S, y_{70} = 0.\n\nAt T=70, y=0, I can U to go to y=1 at next time.\n\nIf a_{70} = U, then y_{71} = 1.\n\nAt T=71, y=1, which is safe, since unsafe only at T=70.\n\nNow, at T=71, position y=1, I can go to y=2 or stay or down.\n\nBut down to 0 is waste.\n\nSo go up, a_{71} = U, then y_{72} = 2.\n\nAt T=72, y=2, safe since y=2 unsafe only at T=69.\n\nSimilarly, a_{72} = U, y_{73} = 3.\n\nAt T=73, y=3, safe.\n\nNow a_{73} = U, y_{74} = 4.\n\nAt T=74, y=4.\n\nNow y=4 unsafe at T=71, not at T=74, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_{74} = U, y_{75} = 5.\n\nAt T=75, y=5, safe (unsafe only T=71).\n\na_{75} = U, y_{76} = 6.\n\nAt T=76, y=6.\n\nNow y=6 unsafe at T=77,78, so at T=76, safe.\n\nNow I am at y=6 at T=76.\n\nI need to go to y=7, but y=7 is unsafe at T=69,70,71, and safe from T=72 onwards.\n\nAt T=76, y=7 should be safe? y=7 safe at T>=72.\n\nAt T=76, if I go to y=7, a_{76} = U, then y_{77} =7.\n\nAt T=77, position y=7.\n\nBut y=7 unsafe at T=77? y=7 unsafe at T=69,70,71, which are earlier, not at T=77.\n\ny=7 unsafe times: T=69,70,71.\n\nAt T=77, it should be safe.\n\nConfirm: for k=7, unsafe at T=69,70,71 as per earlier.\n\nAt T=77, ΔT=77-69=8, for k=7, first car min=37+4*8=37+32=69>0, not cover 0; second car min=-11+4*8=-11+32=21>0? min=-11+4ΔT, at ΔT=8, min=-11+32=21, max=32, both >0, so 0 not in span, safe.\n\nSo at T=77, y=7 is safe.\n\nBut if I go to y=7 at T=77, position at T=77 is y=7, safe.\n\nBut I have y=6 at T=76.\n\nIf a_{76} = U, y_{77}=7.\n\nAt T=77, y=7, safe.\n\nThen I can go to y=8.\n\nBut y=8 has unsafe times later.\n\nFirst, from y=6 at T=76, I go U to y=7 at T=77.\n\na_{76} = U, y_{77} =7.\n\nAt T=77, position y=7, safe as above.\n\nThen a_{77} = U, y_{78} =8.\n\nAt T=78, position y=8.\n\nNow, y=8 unsafe at T=85-88, not at T=78, so should be safe.\n\nConfirm: for k=8, unsafe T=85,86,87,88.\n\nAt T=78, ΔT=9, span min=-59+3*9=-59+27=-32, max=-48+27=-21, both <0, 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen a_{78} = U, y_{79} =9.\n\nAt T=79, position y=9, which is goal, and safe.\n\nNow, let's see the time.\n\nStart at T=69, y=0.\n\nActions:\n\nT=69: a_{69} = S, y_{70} =0\n\nT=70: a_{70} = U, y_{71} =1\n\nT=71: a_{71} = U, y_{72} =2\n\nT=72: a_{72} = U, y_{73} =3\n\nT=73: a_{73} = U, y_{74} =4\n\nT=74: a_{74} = U, y_{75} =5\n\nT=75: a_{75} = U, y_{76} =6\n\nT=76: a_{76} = U, y_{77} =7\n\nT=77: a_{77} = U, y_{78} =8\n\nT=78: a_{78} = U, y_{79} =9\n\nAt T=79, y=9, which is the goal position.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=69 to t=78, that's 10 actions: t=69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78.\n\nH=10 turns? Let's see the sequence.\n\nActions: a_{69} to a_{78}, that's 10 actions, and after that, at time t=79, y=9.\n\nThe first action is at t=69, last at t=78, H=10.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nI started with a stay at t=69, which added one turn.\n\nCould I have started without stay?\n\nAt t=69, if I could go to y=1 directly, but at t=70, y=1 is unsafe, so I couldn't.\n\nPerhaps go to other rows earlier.\n\nFor example, since y=4 and y=5 are safe except t=71, I could be there at other times.\n\nBut in this path, I was at y=4 at t=74, y=5 at t=75, both fine.\n\ny=6 at t=76, safe.\n\ny=7 at t=77, safe.\n\ny=8 at t=78, safe.\n\nNow, y=6 is unsafe at t=77 and 78, but in this path, at t=77 I am on y=7, not y=6.\n\nAt t=77, position y=7, so y=6 is not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, at t=78, y=8.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut I have H=10, from t=69 to t=78 actions, 10 steps.\n\nBut minimal should be 9 if no obstacles.\n\nBut here I had to stay at t=69 to avoid being on y=1 at t=70.\n\nIs there a way with 9 turns?\n\nSuppose I go up at some other time.\n\nFor example, at t=69, I stay, but then at t=70, I could stay again, but that wastes more time.\n\nOr, I could go down, but at y=0, down is same as stay.\n\nAnother idea: since y=2 and y=3 are safe after t=69, but I need to reach them.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=1 later, but in this case, I was on y=1 at t=71, which is safe.\n\nIn the path above, I used 10 actions to reach y=9 at t=79.\n\nBut let's check if I can reach faster.\n\nSuppose I don't stay at t=69, but I have to, because if I go up, collision at t=70.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=1 at a different time.\n\nBut y=1 can only be reached from y=0 or y=2.\n\nAt t=69, y=0.\n\nIf I go up at t=69, y_{70}=1, but at t=70, collision.\n\nIf I stay at t=69, y_{70}=0, then at t=70, I can go up to y=1 at t=71.\n\nThat's what I did.\n\nAt t=70, if I stay, y_{71}=0, then at t=71, I can go to y=1, but y=1 is safe at t=71, same as before.\n\nBut then I delayed, so worse.\n\nSo minimal is to go up as soon as possible after avoiding the unsafe time.\n\nIn this case, for y=1, I can be on it at t=71 or later.\n\nI went at t=71.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows, no issue until y=6.\n\ny=6 is unsafe at t=77 and 78.\n\nIn my path, I am at y=6 at t=76, which is safe, and I go up to y=7 at t=77.\n\nAt t=77, y=6 would be unsafe, but I am not on it; I am on y=7.\n\nSimilarly at t=78.\n\nNow, but y=8 has unsafe times later, but in this path, I am at y=8 at t=78, which is before t=85, so safe.\n\nAnd I reach y=9 at t=79.\n\nTotal actions: from t=69 to t=78, 10 actions.\n\nH=10, and y=9 at t=69+10=79.\n\nBut is there a way with 9 actions?\n\nSuppose I start at t=69, y=0.\n\nAfter 9 actions, y_{78} = ?\n\nIf all U, y_{78} =9, but at t=70, if I were on y=1, unsafe.\n\nSpecifically, if I do a_{69}=U, then y_{70}=1, collision at t=70.\n\nIf I do a_{69}=S, then y_{70}=0, then a_{70} to a_{77}, 8 actions, to go from y=0 to y=9? From y_{70}=0, after 8 actions, y_{78} <= 0 +8 =8, since each U increase by at most 1, so y_{78} <=8 <9.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need at least 9 increases from y=0.\n\nStart y_{69}=0.\n\nAfter first action, y_{70} <=1\n\nAfter second, y_{71} <=2\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, y_{69+k} <= k\n\nSet y_{69+k} =9, so k >=9.\n\nAfter 9 actions, y_{78} =9.\n\nBut for y_{78} to be 9, I must have done exactly 9 U actions, no S or D, so y increases by 1 each step.\n\nSo y_{70}=1, y_{71}=2, ..., y_{78}=9.\n\nBut at t=70, y=1, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach in 9 turns, because I must be on y=1 at t=70 to reach y=9 at t=78 with all U, but y=1 is unsafe at t=70.\n\nIf I have S or D, it takes more turns, so y_{78} <9 if fewer than 9 U.\n\nFor example, after 9 actions, if I have one S, then y_{78} <=8, not 9.\n\nSo to reach y=9 at t=78, I need exactly 9 U actions from t=69 to t=77.\n\nActions a_{69} to a_{77}, that's 9 actions.\n\ny_{69}=0\n\nAfter a_{69}, y_{70} = y_{69} + Δy_{69}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{77}, y_{78} = y_{77} + Δy_{77}\n\nSet y_{78}=9.\n\nSince y_{69}=0, and each action changes y by at most 1, to reach 9 in 9 steps, I must have exactly 9 U actions, no S or D.\n\nThus, y_{70}=1, y_{71}=2, y_{72}=3, ..., y_{78}=9.\n\nNow, at time t=70, position y=1, but y=1 is unsafe at t=70, collision.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach y=9 at t=78 with 9 actions.\n\nThus minimal H is at least 10.\n\nIn my earlier path, I reached at t=79 with 10 actions.\n\nIn that path, I had one S and 9 U, total 10 actions.\n\ny_{79}=9.\n\nNow, in that path, I was never on an unsafe position.\n\nBut let me double-check the unsafe times, especially for y=7.\n\nIn my path: at t=77, y=7.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=69,70,71, not at t=77.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut y=6 unsafe at t=77 and 78, but at t=77, I was on y=7, not y=6.\n\nAt t=78, on y=8.\n\nNow, but I have y=8 at t=78, which is safe.\n\ny=8 unsafe only at t=85-88.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, I have actions from t=69 to t=78.\n\nt=69: S\n\nt=70: U\n\nt=71: U\n\nt=72: U\n\nt=73: U\n\nt=74: U\n\nt=75: U\n\nt=76: U\n\nt=77: U\n\nt=78: U\n\nThen y_{79}=9.\n\nNow, positions:\n\nt=69: y=0 (safe)\n\nt=70: y=0 (after S, safe)\n\nt=71: y=1 (safe, since not unsafe time)\n\nt=72: y=2 (safe)\n\nt=73: y=3 (safe)\n\nt=74: y=4 (safe, unsafe only t=71)\n\nt=75: y=5 (safe)\n\nt=76: y=6 (safe, unsafe t=77,78 but not now)\n\nt=77: y=7 (safe)\n\nt=78: y=8 (safe)\n\nt=79: y=9 (goal)\n\nAll safe.\n\nH=10 actions.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? H=10 is minimal since 9 impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier by going slower or something, but no, with S or D it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, if I stay more, it takes longer.\n\nSo H=10 should be minimal.\n\nBut in the beginning, I had to stay at t=69 to avoid.\n\nPerhaps I could go to y=1 at a later time, but that would delay reaching y=9.\n\nFor example, if at t=70 I stay, then at t=71 go to y=1, same as before but one more stay.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the path above seems optimal.\n\nNow, but I need to output the sequence.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1=69.\n\nActions from t=69 to t=78.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1}\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nH=10, so from t=69 to t=78, that is t_1 to t_1 +9.\n\nt_1=69, t_1 + (H-1) =69 +9=78.\n\nActions: a_{69} to a_{78}\n\nAs above: a_{69}=S, a_{70}=U, a_{71}=U, ..., a_{78}=U\n\nSpecifically:\n\nTurn 69: S\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nIn the sequence, a_{71} to a_{78} all U.\n\nBut let me confirm if there is any issue with y=6 or others.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=77 and 78.\n\nIn this path, at t=76, I am at y=6, which is safe.\n\nThen I move to y=7 at t=77.\n\nAt t=77, I am on y=7, not on y=6.\n\nSimilarly at t=78, on y=8.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nSimilarly, all other rows are fine.\n\nNow, about the car on y=7 at t=77: as I said, safe.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's list all positions and times.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 earlier if I can skip some rows, but I can't, since I move one step at a time.\n\nUnless I move down and up, but that increases turns.\n\nSo I think H=10 is minimal.\n\nIn the sequence, I have one S and nine U, total 10 actions.\n\nThe player reaches y=9 at t=79.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=10, t_1=69.\n\nSo turns: 69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78\n\nActions: S, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nAlso, in the car states, for y=7, it has two cars, but we already checked.\n\nAnother thing: in the beginning, for y=2 and y=3, they are unsafe at t=69, but in my path, I am not on them at that time.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 and y=5 unsafe at t=71, but at t=71 I am on y=1, not on them.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 69: S\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 69: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 70: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 71: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 72: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 73: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 74: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 75: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 76: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 77: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 78: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut the turn numbers are absolute, I think.\n\nSince t_1=69, but in the output, it should be with the turn numbers.\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for turn 69 to 78.\n\nNow, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 69\\) is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a freeway row when a car covers \\(x = 0\\) at that turn.\n\n- At turn 69, the player starts at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no freeway).

The path ensures that the player is not on any freeway row during its unsafe times:\n  - \\(y = 1\\): unsafe only at turn 70; player is on \\(y = 1\\) at turn 71 (safe).\n  - \\(y = 2\\): unsafe only at turn 69; player is on \\(y = 2\\) at turn 72 (safe).\n  - \\(y = 3\\): unsafe only at turn 69; player is on \\(y = 3\\) at turn 73 (safe).\n  - \\(y = 4\\): unsafe only at turn 71; player is on \\(y = 4\\) at turn 74 (safe).\n  - \\(y = 5\\): unsafe only at turn 71; player is on \\(y = 5\\) at turn 75 (safe).\n  - \\(y = 6\\): unsafe at turns 77 and 78; player is on \\(y = 6\\) at turn 76 (safe) and moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 77.\n  - \\(y = 7\\): unsafe at turns 69, 70, and 71; player is on \\(y = 7\\) at turn 77 (safe, as unsafe times are earlier).\n  - \\(y = 8\\): unsafe at turns 85 to 88; player is on \\(y = 8\\) at turn 78 (safe, as unsafe times are later).\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 69: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 70: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 71: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 72: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 73: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 74: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 75: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 76: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 77: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 78: U \\end{array} }",

The grid has y from 0 to 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway y=1 to 8, and they move left or right with given speeds. Collision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that when you move, you're not on the new freeway until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, you're on y at turn T, and on y+1 at turn T+1.

The notation says for right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h], so tail τ to head h, with h > τ.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h], so at t1, the car is from τ to h, with τ < h. Then at time T, it moves to [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] with h > τ, I assume? It says [h, τ], and then [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)], so since it's moving left, h decreases, τ decreases.\n\nIn the left-moving case, it says span(t1) = [h, τ], but typically we think of head and tail, but here h and τ might be such that for left-moving, h is the front, which is smaller if moving left? I need to be careful.\n\nLet's read:\n\nFor left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIt doesn't specify which is head or tail, but in the example, for freeway 1, it's (head, tail, direction, speed) = (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nSo head is 0, tail is -47, direction right. Since right-moving, the head is at higher x, so at t1, the car spans from τ to h, which is -47 to 0.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, head would be at lower x.\n\nBut in the span, it's given as [h, τ] for left, but in the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, dir, speed).\n\nIn freeway 4, for example: (12, 47, left, 36). Head 12, tail 47, left direction. Since left-moving, head should be on the left, so smaller x, tail on right. But here head=12, tail=47, so head=12, tail=47, but since moving left, at t1, the front is at 12, back at 47? That doesn't make sense because if moving left, front should be smaller.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nLet's look back at the car update rules.\n\nIt says: for car k, at turn t1, head at h, tail at τ.\n\nThen for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ]? But if moving left, and h is head, τ is tail, then head should be on the left, so h < τ, and span should be [h, τ] with h < τ.\n\nIn the update: for left-moving, span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)], which decreases, so if h < τ, then [h, τ] moves left.\n\nIn freeway 4: (head, tail, dir, speed) = (12, 47, left, 36)\n\nIf head=12, tail=47, and left direction, then since moving left, head is on the left, so at t1, the car is from x=12 to x=47? But if moving left, the head should be at smaller x, but 12 < 47, so from 12 to 47, with head at 12, tail at 47, moving left, so it's decreasing, so at next turn, it would be at [12-36, 47-36] for T=t1+1, etc.\n\nBut typically, if it's moving left, and head is at 12, tail at 47, that means the front is at 12, which is left, and back at 47, right, so as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like freeway 1: head=0, tail=-47, right direction, so at t1, from τ=-47 to h=0, so [-47,0], moving right, so increases.\n\nIn the span notation, for right-moving, it's [τ, h], for left-moving, it's [h, τ], but in both cases, the first number is the left end, second is right end? No.\n\nFor right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h], with τ < h, so [left, right]\n\nFor left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ], and since moving left, h is head on left, τ tail on right, so h < τ, so [left, right] = [h, τ]\n\nIn both cases, the span is given as [left, right] of the car at time t1.\n\nThen at time T, for right-moving: span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [left + sΔT, right + sΔT]\n\nFor left-moving: span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [left - sΔT, right - sΔT]\n\nWhere ΔT = T - t1.\n\nAnd collision if player at (0, y) at turn T, and for freeway y, 0 is within some car's span on y at T.\n\nThat is, min(span) <= 0 <= max(span) for that car.\n\nSince span is [left, right], with left <= right.\n\nNow for the player, when at position (0, y_T) at turn T, we check if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nBut note that if the player moves at turn T, the position changes at the end of the turn, so at turn T, before action, position is y_T, after action y_{T+1}, but the position during the turn is y_T for collision check.\n\nFrom the game dynamics: collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T at turn T, and 0 is in span(T) for some car on that freeway.\n\nAnd the position at turn T is defined before the action, I think? Let's see.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t based on action at t.\n\nSo at the start of turn t, position is y_t. Then action a_t is taken, which determines Δy_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nFor collision at turn t: it says \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\".\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T, which is the position at the start of turn T, before action.\n\nThen after action, position changes to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nAnd when you move, you are not on the new freeway during the move; only at the next turn.\n\nIn this case, at turn T, you are on y_T, and collision is checked based on that.\n\nIf you move up at turn T, you are on y_T during turn T, and after move, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1} = y_T +1.\n\nSimilarly for down or stay.\n\nNow, the goal is to reach y=9 as soon as possible, starting from y=0 at turn t1=70.\n\ny=9 is the top, and there are no cars on y=9 or y=0, I think, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nBut we start at (0,0) and need to reach (0,9), so we need to go through the freeways.\n\nMinimal H: since we need to go from y=0 to y=9, the minimum possible is 9 turns if we go up every turn, but we might need to avoid cars, so it could take longer if we have to wait or go down sometimes.\n\nBut let's see the car positions and movements.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the cars at t1=70.\n\nt1=70.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head=0, tail=-47, dir=right, speed=48. So at t1, span = [τ, h] = [-47, 0] since right-moving.\n\nActually, as per notation, for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-47, 0]\n\nThen at time T, span(T) = [ -47 + 48*(T-70), 0 + 48*(T-70) ]\n\nCollision if at turn T, player on y=1 and 0 in span(T), i.e. min <= 0 <= max, so -47 + 48ΔT <= 0 <= 48ΔT where ΔT = T-70\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nNow, since we start at y=0 at t=70, and y=0 has no cars, so at turn 70, we are safe, no collision.\n\nThen we take action at turn 70 to go to some y for turn 71.\n\nWe need to plan the sequence.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each turn around now, when is it safe to be on that freeway, i.e., when 0 is not in the car span.\n\nSince the cars move, the safe times are periodic or depend on the speeds.\n\nBut multiple cars per freeway, so we need to check all cars on that freeway.\n\nList all freeways:\n\nFreeway 1: y=1, one car: (-47,0) at t1, right, s=48.\n\nSpan at T: [ -47 + 48ΔT, 0 + 48ΔT ] = [48ΔT -47, 48ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 48ΔT -47 <= 0 <= 48ΔT\n\nSince 48ΔT -47 <= 0 <= 48ΔT, which implies 0 <= 48ΔT and 48ΔT -47 <=0, so 48ΔT <=47? Let's solve inequalities.\n\n48ΔT -47 <= 0 <= 48ΔT\n\nFirst, 0 <= 48ΔT always true if ΔT >=0, since ΔT integer, T>=70.\n\n48ΔT -47 <= 0 iff 48ΔT <=47 iff ΔT <= 47/48 <1, so ΔT =0, since ΔT integer >=0.\n\nThen 0 <= 48ΔT, for ΔT=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nFor ΔT=0, 48*0 -47 = -47 <=0 <=0, true.\n\nFor ΔT=1, [48*1 -47, 48*1] = [1,48], 0 not in [1,48], so safe.\n\nSimilarly, for ΔT>=1, min=48ΔT-47 >=1>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe only when ΔT=0, i.e., turn t=70.\n\nBut at turn t=70, if player on y=1, but at t=70, player is at y=0, not on y=1, so for future turns, when player might be on y=1.\n\nAt turn T, if on y=1, collision if 0 in span(T).\n\nFor T=70, span=[-47,0], 0 in it, unsafe.\n\nT=71, ΔT=1, span=[1,48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=72, [49,96], etc, all safe for T>70.\n\nSo freeway 1 is safe for all T >70, since min >0.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2, two cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49, right,12) head=60, tail=49, dir=right, speed=12.\n\nSince right, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [49,60]\n\nAt T, span(T) = [49 + 12ΔT, 60 + 12ΔT]\n\nSecond car: (12,1, right,12) head=12, tail=1, dir=right, speed=12.\n\nSpan(t1) = [1,12] for this car? τ=1, h=12, so [1,12]\n\nAt T, [1 + 12ΔT, 12 + 12ΔT]\n\nNow, collision if on y=2 at T and 0 in either car's span.\n\nFirst car: [49 + 12ΔT, 60 + 12ΔT], min = 49 +12ΔT >=49>0 for ΔT>=0, so 0 never in this span.\n\nSimilarly, second car: [1 + 12ΔT, 12 + 12ΔT], min=1+12ΔT >=1>0 for ΔT>=0, so 0 never in this span either.\n\n1 +12ΔT >=1 >0, yes, so both cars always have min >0, so 0 never in span for any T, so freeway 2 is always safe? But let's confirm.\n\nAt T=70, ΔT=0, first car [49,60], second [1,12], both >0, so 0 not in, safe.\n\nFor any T, min is at least 1, so yes, freeway 2 is always safe, no car covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: y=3, same as freeway 2? Cars: (60,49, right,12) and (12,1, right,12)\n\nExactly the same as freeway 2.\n\nSo span same, always min >=1, so freeway 3 always safe.\n\nNow freeway 4: y=4, cars: (12,47, left,36)\n\nHead=12, tail=47, dir=left, speed=36.\n\nSince left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] = [12,47]? As per notation, [h, τ] with h=12, τ=47.\n\nThen at T, span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] = [12 - 36ΔT, 47 - 36ΔT]\n\nCollision if 0 in [12 -36ΔT, 47 -36ΔT]\n\nWhich requires 12 -36ΔT <= 0 <= 47 -36ΔT\n\nSo 12 -36ΔT <=0 and 0 <=47 -36ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: 12 -36ΔT <=0 => 36ΔT >=12 => ΔT >= 12/36 = 1/3, so ΔT >=1 since integer.\n\nSecond: 0 <=47 -36ΔT => 36ΔT <=47 => ΔT <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so ΔT <=1\n\nThus for ΔT=1, both: ΔT=1, first: 12-36= -24 <=0 true, 0<=47-36=11 true.\n\nFor ΔT=0: [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=1: [12-36,47-36]=[-24,11], 0 in [-24,11], yes.\n\nΔT=2: [12-72,47-72]=[-60,-25], min=-60<0, max=-25<0, 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe only for ΔT=1, i.e., T=71.\n\nFor other ΔT, safe.\n\nFreeway 4 has only one car? The table says for freeway 4: (12,47,left,36) and that's it? In the table it shows only one entry, so one car.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as freeway 4? Cars: (12,47,left,36) identical to freeway 4.\n\nSo for freeway 5, same as above, unsafe only at T=71.\n\nNow freeway 6: y=6, cars: (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nHead=-42? Tail=-53, dir=right, speed=6.\n\nRight-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-53, -42]\n\nAt T, [ -53 +6ΔT, -42 +6ΔT ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -53+6ΔT, -42+6ΔT ]\n\nSo -53+6ΔT <=0 <= -42+6ΔT\n\nFirst: -53+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=53 => ΔT <= 53/6 ≈8.833, so ΔT <=8\n\nSecond: 0 <= -42+6ΔT => 42 <=6ΔT => ΔT >= 42/6 =7\n\nSo for ΔT from 7 to 8 inclusive.\n\nΔT=7: min=-53+42= -11? -53+6*7= -53+42= -11, max=-42+42=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔT=8: min=-53+48= -5, max=-42+48=6, [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nΔT=6: min=-53+36= -17, max=-42+36= -6, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nΔT=9: min=-53+54=1, max=-42+54=12, both positive.\n\nSo unsafe for ΔT=7 and 8, i.e., T=77 and 78.\n\nNow freeway 7: y=7, two cars.\n\nFirst car: (52,41,right,4) head=52, tail=41, dir=right, speed=4.\n\nSpan(t1) = [τ, h] = [41,52]\n\nAt T, [41+4ΔT, 52+4ΔT], min>=41>0, always safe, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (4,-7,right,4) head=4, tail=-7, dir=right, speed=4.\n\nSpan(t1) = [τ, h] = [-7,4]\n\nAt T, [ -7 +4ΔT, 4 +4ΔT ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -7+4ΔT, 4+4ΔT ]\n\nSo -7+4ΔT <=0 <=4+4ΔT\n\nFirst: -7+4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=7 => ΔT <=7/4=1.75, so ΔT <=1\n\nSecond: 0 <=4+4ΔT always true for ΔT>=0.\n\nSo for ΔT=0: [-7,4], 0 in it.\n\nΔT=1: [-7+4,4+4]=[-3,8], 0 in it.\n\nΔT=2: [-7+8,4+8]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=3: [5,16], etc.\n\nSo unsafe for ΔT=0 and 1, i.e., T=70 and 71.\n\nBut at T=70, if on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, for other ΔT, safe when ΔT>=2.\n\nNow freeway 8: y=8, cars: (-45,-56,right,3)\n\nHead=-45, tail=-56, dir=right, speed=3.\n\nSpan(t1) = [τ, h] = [-56, -45]\n\nAt T, [ -56 +3ΔT, -45 +3ΔT ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -56+3ΔT, -45+3ΔT ]\n\nSo -56+3ΔT <=0 <= -45+3ΔT\n\nFirst: -56+3ΔT <=0 => 3ΔT <=56 => ΔT <=56/3≈18.666, ΔT<=18\n\nSecond: 0 <= -45+3ΔT => 45 <=3ΔT => ΔT >=15\n\nSo for ΔT from 15 to 18 inclusive.\n\nΔT=15: min=-56+45= -11, max=-45+45=0, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nΔT=16: min=-56+48= -8, max=-45+48=3, [-8,3], 0 in.\n\nΔT=17: min=-56+51= -5, max=-45+51=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔT=18: min=-56+54= -2, max=-45+54=9, [-2,9], 0 in.\n\nΔT=14: min=-56+42= -14, max=-45+42= -3, both neg, 0 not in.\n\nΔT=19: min=-56+57=1, max=-45+57=12, both pos.\n\nSo unsafe for ΔT=15 to 18, T=85 to 88.\n\nNow, summarize the unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: unsafe only at T=70\n\n- y=2: always safe\n\n- y=3: always safe\n\n- y=4: unsafe at T=71\n\n- y=5: unsafe at T=71 (same as y=4)\n\n- y=6: unsafe at T=77,78 (ΔT=7,8)\n\n- y=7: unsafe at T=70,71 (ΔT=0,1)\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=85 to 88 (ΔT=15 to 18)\n\nWe start at turn t=70, position y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be 9, but we need to avoid collisions.\n\nSince y=2 and y=3 are always safe, we can go through them freely.\n\nBut we have to go from y=0 to y=1, then to y=2, etc., up to y=9.\n\nAt turn 70, we are at y=0.\n\nWe take action at turn 70: U, D, or S.\n\nIf we go U, we move to y=1 at turn 71.\n\nIf we stay, at turn 71 still at y=0, etc.\n\nNow, y=1 is unsafe only at T=70, but at T=70 we are not on y=1, so we can be on y=1 at other times.\n\nFor example, at turn 71, y=1 is safe, as we saw.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 is unsafe at T=70 and 71, but safe after.\n\nWe need to plan the path.\n\nSince we want minimal turns, we should go up as much as possible, but avoid the unsafe times.\n\nStart at t=70, y=70=0.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nThe direct path: go up every turn, but we might hit unsafe freeways at certain times.\n\nLet's simulate turn by turn.\n\nTurn t=70: position y=0 (safe, no freeway). Action a_70.\n\nOptions: U, D, or S.\n\nIf we go U, then at turn 71, y=1.\n\nIf we stay S, at turn 71, y=0.\n\nIf D, y= -1, but y cannot be below 0, so D from y=0 not possible, y stays 0.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y in [0,9], so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) =0, similarly at top.\n\nSo from y=0, D or S both lead to y=0 next turn. U leads to y=1.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, U or S lead to y=9, D to y=8.\n\nNow, to minimize time, we should go up whenever possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nList the unsafe (y,T) pairs:\n\n- (1,70): unsafe, but we are not there at t=70.\n\n- (4,71): unsafe\n\n- (5,71): unsafe\n\n- (6,77) and (6,78): unsafe\n\n- (7,70) and (7,71): unsafe\n\n- (8,85) to (8,88): unsafe\n\nAll other (y,T) are safe for the freeways.\n\ny=2 and y=3 always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 no cars, safe.\n\nWe start at (0,70).\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal turns: since from 0 to 9, at least 9 actions to increase y by 9.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, D decreases, S no change.\n\nThe net number of U must be 9 more than D, and we need at least 9 turns if we go up every time.\n\nBut with waits or downs, it takes more turns.\n\nWe should avoid unnecessary downs or stays.\n\nNow, the unsafe times are at specific turns, so we might need to delay or avoid those.\n\nFirst, y=7 is unsafe at t=70 and 71, so we should not be on y=7 at t=70 or 71.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 and y=5 are unsafe at t=71, so not on y=4 or 5 at t=71.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=77,78.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=85-88, which is later, might not affect minimal path.\n\nt=85 is turn 85, t1=70, so ΔT=15, etc.\n\nNow, let's find a fast path.\n\nSuppose we go up immediately.\n\nTurn 70: at y=0, action U, so at turn 71, y=1.\n\nNow, at t=71, y=1, which is safe (only unsafe at t=70).\n\nThen at turn 71, we can go U to y=2 at t=72.\n\ny=2 is always safe.\n\nAt turn 72, y=2, go U to y=3 at t=73.\n\ny=3 always safe.\n\nAt turn 73, y=3, go U to y=4 at t=74.\n\nNow, at t=74, we are on y=4.\n\ny=4 is unsafe only at t=71, but t=74 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 unsafe at t=71, but we are not there.\n\nSo at turn 74, y=4 safe, we can go U to y=5 at t=75.\n\ny=5 at t=75: unsafe only at t=71, so safe at t=75.\n\nThen U to y=6 at t=76.\n\ny=6 at t=76: unsafe at t=77 and 78, but t=76 is before, so safe?

Let's see.\n\nTurn t: position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} set.\n\nWe start at t=70, y_70=0.\n\nAfter action a_70, y_71 set, and so on.\n\nWe reach y=9 at some turn T.\n\nAt turn T, y_T =9.\n\nThen H is such that T = t_1 + H -1? t_1=70.\n\nAt turn t_1, we are at step 0.\n\nAfter first action, at turn t_1+1, we are at step 1, etc.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=70 to t=70 + H -1, and after H actions, at turn t=70 + H, we have y_{70+H} =9.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nTurn t_1 =70: initial position y_{t_1} =0.\n\nWe apply actions a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, such that after these H actions, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd we want minimal H.\n\nIn this case, if we go up every turn from t=70 to t=78, that's 9 actions: a_70 to a_78, then y_79=9.\n\nt_1=70.\n\na_{70}, a_{71}, ..., a_{78}: 9 actions.\n\nAfter a_{78}, y_{79} = y_{78} +1 (since U), and if y_{78}=8, y_{79}=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=78, y=8, action U, y_{79}=9.\n\nSo H=9, turns from t=70 to t=78 for actions, y reaches 9 at t=79.\n\nBut in the path I described, we were at y=6 at t=76, which is safe, then to y=7 at t=77, safe, y=8 at t=78, safe, y=9 at t=79.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=6 unsafe at t=77 and 78, but at t=76 we are on y=6, which is before t=77, so safe, and we leave to y=7 at t=77.\n\nAt t=77, we are on y=7, which is safe, as we calculated.\n\nSimilarly, no problem with y=4 or y=5, since we pass at t=74 and t=75, not at t=71.\n\nBut what about y=7 at t=70 and 71, but we are there at t=77, which is fine.\n\nIn this path, we didn't encounter any unsafe situation.\n\nBut let me confirm the times.\n\nAt t=70: y=0, safe.\n\nAction U.\n\nt=71: y=1, which is safe (only unsafe at t=70, not here).\n\nAction U.\n\nt=72: y=2, always safe, action U.\n\nt=73: y=3, always safe, action U.\n\nt=74: y=4, at t=74, ΔT=4, for y=4, car: span [12 -36*4, 47-36*4] = [12-144,47-144]=[-132,-97], both negative, 0 not in, safe. Action U.\n\nt=75: y=5, similarly, [12-36*5,47-36*5]=[12-180,47-180]=[-168,-133], safe. Action U.\n\nt=76: y=6, [ -53 +6*6, -42 +6*6] = [-53+36, -42+36]=[-17,-6], both neg, safe. Action U.\n\nt=77: y=7, at t=77, ΔT=7, for y=7, second car: [ -7 +4*7, 4+4*7] = [-7+28,4+28]=[21,32], min=21>0, safe. First car not relevant. Action U.\n\nt=78: y=8, at t=78, ΔT=8, [ -56 +3*8, -45+3*8]=[-56+24, -45+24]=[-32,-21], both neg, safe. Action U.\n\nt=79: y=9, safe, reached.\n\nSo with 9 actions: a70 to a78 all U, we reach at t=79.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we did in 9 turns.\n\nBut is there a way in fewer turns? No, because we start at y=0, need to reach y=9, each step can increase y by at most 1, so minimum 9 steps.\n\nAnd we achieved it without collision.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=71, we are on y=1, which is safe, and no issue.\n\nBut earlier I thought about y=4 and y=5 unsafe at t=71, but we are not there at t=71.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 unsafe at t=77,78, but at t=77 we are on y=7, not y=6.\n\nAt t=78 on y=8.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 7 at t=77.\n\ny=7, t=77, ΔT=77-70=7.\n\nCars on y=7:\n\nFirst car: (52,41,right,4), span at T: [41+4ΔT,52+4ΔT] = [41+28,52+28]=[69,80] for ΔT=7, not near 0.\n\nSecond car: (4,-7,right,4), span at T: [ -7 +4ΔT, 4 +4ΔT ] = [-7+28, 4+28]=[21,32], both >0, so 0 not in span, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nNow, but the car state for freeway 2 and 3 have cars, but they don't cover x=0, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1 only unsafe at t=70.\n\nSo this seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence for actions starting from t_1.\n\nSo for H=9, actions: turn 70: U, turn 71: U, ..., up to turn 78: U.\n\nThen at turn 79, we are at y=9.\n\nBut the sequence is for actions from t=70 to t=78, that's 9 actions.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nAnd we reach at turn 79.\n\nBut is there any issue I missed?\n\nIn freeway 4 and 5, they are identical, but we passed safely.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster, but no, 9 is minimum.\n\nMaybe we can reach earlier, but we start at t=70, y=0, first possible at y=9 is t=79 if we go up every turn.\n\nt=79 is turn 79, which is t_1 + 9.\n\nt_1=70, t=79 is 70+9.\n\nSince we start at turn t_1, after k actions, at turn t_1 + k.\n\nAt turn t_1, position given.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position at turn t_1 +1 is set.\n\nAfter H actions, position at turn t_1 + H is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nSet y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nWith H=9, y_{79}=9.\n\nNow, but in the car states, for freeway 2 and 3, there are cars, but as we saw, they don't affect x=0.\n\nSimilarly, all seems fine.\n\nBut let me check if at any point we are on a freeway at unsafe time.\n\nIn the path: at t=71, y=1, safe.\n\nt=72, y=2, safe.\n\netc.\n\nt=77, y=7, safe.\n\nt=78, y=8, safe.\n\nNo problem.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=6 unsafe at t=77, but we are not on y=6 at t=77.\n\nAt t=76, we are on y=6, which is safe, then move to y=7 at t=77.\n\nAt t=77, we are on y=7, not y=6.\n\nSo the collision check is only for the current freeway at current turn.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider if we should wait or something, but in this case, no need.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nIt should be the sequence of actions.\n\nBut the minimal H is 9.\n\nBut is there a problem with freeway 1 at turn 71?\n\nNo, safe.\n\nAnother thing: the player position is (0,y), and cars are on the freeways, but when we are on y=0 or y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nIn this path, we never stayed or went down, all up.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we try to go slower, it would take more turns, so worse.\n\nPerhaps we can skip some levels, but no, we have to go through each y, since we move one at a time.\n\nUnless we stay, but staying doesn't help.\n\nOr down, but down would make us go away from goal.\n\nSo minimal is 9.\n\nBut let me confirm the unsafe times again.\n\nFor y=4, unsafe only at t=71? t=71 is turn 71.\n\nIn our path, at t=71, we are on y=1, not y=4.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at t=71 unsafe, but not there.\n\ny=7 at t=70 and 71 unsafe, but we are there at t=77, safe.\n\ny=6 at t=77 and 78 unsafe, but at t=77 we are on y=7, at t=78 on y=8.\n\nAt t=76 on y=6, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, unsafe at t=85-88, but we pass at t=78, which is fine.\n\nt=78 is before.\n\nSo I think H=9 is achievable.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 9 turns.\n\nNow, actions from turn 70 to turn 78.\n\nt_1=70, so turns: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+8 for actions? t from 70 to 78 inclusive is 9 turns: 70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78.\n\nThen y_{79}=9.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} = U\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 + 8: a_{t_1 + 8} = U\n\nSince t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +8 for H=9.\n\nGeneral: after H actions, from t_1 to t_1 + H -1 for actions, position at t_1 + H.\n\nSet t_1 + H = T where y_T=9.\n\nMin H such that T = t_1 + H, so H = T - t_1.\n\nWith T=79, H=9.\n\nSequence: actions at t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1 = 70 to 78.\n\nAll U.\n\nNow, in the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 78: U\n\nBut in terms of t_1:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 + 8: U\n\nAnd we are done.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but in the answer format, it just shows the sequence, not stating H.\n\nBut we need to output the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I should write it.\n\nBut is there any mistake?\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 7, there are two cars, but we handled.\n\nFreeway 2 and 3 have two cars each, but both safe.\n\nFreeway 6 has one car, but we passed when safe.\n\nBut at t=76, y=6, we are safe, then we move up.\n\nBut at t=77, if we were on y=6, it would be unsafe, but we are not.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we need to be careful at some point, but here no.\n\nMaybe we can reach faster by going down or something, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nFor example, if we go down at some point to avoid, but since the unsafe times are specific, and we can avoid by timing, but in this case, we don't need to.\n\nSuppose we stay at y=0 for one turn, then go up.\n\nBut then we start later, so we reach later.\n\nFor example, at t=70, if we stay S, then at t=71, y=0, then U to y=1 at t=72, then we are behind, so to reach y=9, it would be at t=80 or later, worse.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down, same thing.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 9 with all U.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 1.\n\nAt t=70, if we were on y=1, unsafe, but we start at y=0.\n\nAt t=71, y=1 is safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nSo the sequence should be all U for 9 actions.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 70\\) is 9.

Since \\(y = 0\\) has no cars, it is safe.\n- At turn 71, the player is at \\((0, 1)\\). Freeway \\(y = 1\\) is unsafe only at turn 70, so it is safe at turn 71. The player moves up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 72.\n- At turn 72, the player is at \\((0, 2)\\). Freeway \\(y = 2\\) is always safe (cars never cover \\(x = 0\\)), so the player moves up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 73.\n- At turn 73, the player is at \\((0, 3)\\). Freeway \\(y = 3\\) is always safe, so the player moves up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 74.\n- At turn 74, the player is at \\((0, 4)\\). Freeway \\(y = 4\\) is unsafe only at turn 71, so it is safe at turn 74. The player moves up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 75.\n- At turn 75, the player is at \\((0, 5)\\). Freeway \\(y = 5\\) is unsafe only at turn 71, so it is safe at turn 75. The player moves up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 76.\n- At turn 76, the player is at \\((0, 6)\\). Freeway \\(y = 6\\) is unsafe at turns 77 and 78, but at turn 76, \\(\\Delta T = 6\\), and the car span is \\([-17, -6]\\), which does not contain 0, so it is safe. The player moves up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 77.\n- At turn 77, the player is at \\((0, 7)\\). Freeway \\(y = 7\\) is unsafe at turns 70 and 71, but at turn 77, \\(\\Delta T = 7\\), and the relevant car span is \\([21, 32]\\), which does not contain 0, so it is safe. The player moves up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 78.\n- At turn 78, the player is at \\((0, 8)\\). Freeway \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe at turns 85 to 88, but at turn 78, \\(\\Delta T = 8\\), and the car span is \\([-32, -21]\\), which does not contain 0, so it is safe. The player moves up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 79.\n\nAt turn 79, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\), which is safe as it has no cars. This path takes exactly 9 turns, and since each upward move increases \\(y\\) by 1, 9 is the minimum possible.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 70: U \\\\\nTurn 71: U \\\\\nTurn 72: U \\\\\nTurn 73: U \\\\\nTurn 74: U \\\\\nTurn 75: U \\\\\nTurn 76: U \\\\\nTurn 77: U \\\\\nTurn 78: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0,1) at turn t_1 = 71. The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. Each turn, the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn. Importantly, if the player moves to a different y at turn T, they are not considered on that new y until the next turn, so they only check collision for the current y at each turn.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions that gets from y=1 to y=9 in min H turns without colliding.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements for each freeway since they move over time.\n\nThe car update: for a car, at turn t_1, we have head, tail, direction, speed. Then at turn T > t_1, the span changes based on direction and speed.\n\nFor left-moving cars (I assume d=\"left\" means moving left, so decreasing x), the span shifts left by s*(T-t_1).\n\nSimilarly, right-moving shifts right.\n\nThe collision is if 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway the player is on.\n\nt_1 is 71, so we need to compute for turns starting from 71.\n\nPlayer position at turn t is y_t.\n\nAt each turn, when the player is on y, we check if for that y, at that turn, there is a car where 0 is in its span.\n\nNow, let's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): one car: (48, 1, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so it's moving right. Head 48, tail 1. Since direction right, head should be greater than tail? The notation says for right-moving: span [τ, h] with τ tail, h head? Let me check.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (48, 1, right, 48)\n\nBut it says (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head.\n\nHere head=48, tail=1, so since right, τ=1, h=48, so span at t_1 is [1,48].\n\nAt turn T, span is [1 + 48*(T-71), 48 + 48*(T-71)] since s=48.\n\nCollision if 0 is in this span at some T.\n\n0 in [1 + 48Δ, 48 + 48Δ] for Δ = T - t_1 = T - 71.\n\n1 + 48Δ ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 48Δ? Since Δ ≥0, 1 + 48Δ ≥1 >0, so 0 is always less than lower bound, so never in span. 1 + 48Δ is at least 1, so 0 < 1 + 48Δ ≤ left end, so 0 not in [left, right] since left >0. So no collision possible on freeway 1 at any time, because the car is always to the right of 0.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 1: no collision risk.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2\n\nCars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head=-48, tail=-59, direction right, speed 12.\n\nSince right, span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48] because tail should be left, head right? For right-moving, [τ, h] with τ < h typically, but here tail=-59, head=-48, so τ=-59, h=-48, span [-59, -48].\n\nAt T, span: [ -59 + 12Δ, -48 + 12Δ] with Δ = T - 71.\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -59 +12Δ, -48 +12Δ]\n\nSo -59 +12Δ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +12Δ\n\nFirst inequality: -59 +12Δ ≤ 0 ⇒ 12Δ ≤ 59 ⇒ Δ ≤ 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so Δ ≤ 4 since integer? Δ is integer because turns are discrete.\n\nT and t_1 are integers, I assume, so Δ is integer.\n\nSo -59 +12Δ ≤ 0 ⇒ 12Δ ≤ 59 ⇒ Δ ≤ 4 since 12*4=48<59, 12*5=60>59, so Δ ≤4? 12Δ ≤59, Δ=4: 48≤59, true; Δ=5:60>59 false? Inequality: -59 +12Δ ≤0 ⇒ 12Δ ≤59, since 12*4=48≤59, 12*5=60>59, so for Δ=0 to 4, 12Δ≤48<59? 48≤59 true, but -59+48= -11 ≤0 true; for Δ=5, -59+60=1>0, so -59+12Δ ≤0 only for Δ≤4? Let's see:\n\n-59 +12Δ ≤0 when 12Δ ≤59, Δ≤59/12=4.916, so since Δ integer, Δ≤4.\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ -48 +12Δ ⇒ -48 +12Δ ≥0 ⇒ 12Δ ≥48 ⇒ Δ≥4.\n\nSo 0 in span when Δ≤4 and Δ≥4, so only at Δ=4.\n\nΔ=4: lower bound -59+48= -11, upper bound -48+48=0? -48 +12*4= -48+48=0.\n\nSo span at T=71+4=75: [ -11, 0 ] so 0 is included, collision if on y=2 at turn 75.\n\nNow second car on freeway 2: (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nHead=24, tail=13, direction right, so span at t_1: [τ,h] = [13,24]\n\nAt T: [13 +12Δ, 24 +12Δ]\n\n0 in this? 13+12Δ ≤0 ≤24+12Δ? 13+12Δ ≤0 ⇒12Δ≤-13, impossible since Δ≥0. So never, always positive.\n\nSo for freeway 2, only collision risk at T=75 when Δ=4, from the first car.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3\n\nCars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24, 13, right, 12) same as freeway 2.\n\nSo identical to freeway 2, collision only at T=75 if on y=3.\n\nFreeway 4: y=4\n\nCars: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, span at t_1: [h, τ]? From update: left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - sΔ, τ - sΔ]\n\nHere head=-24, tail=11? That seems odd. Head and tail: typically head is front, but for left-moving, if moving left, head should be left, tail right? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the table: (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor left direction, in update: [h, τ] with h head, τ tail, and for left-moving, it shifts left.\n\nBut here head=-24, tail=11, and direction left.\n\nIf moving left, head should be on the left, but -24 < 11, so head is left of tail? -24 is left of 11 if x increases right.\n\nAssume x-axis, left is smaller x, right is larger x.\n\nSo for left-moving car, it moves to decreasing x, so head is at smaller x, tail at larger x.\n\nIn this case, head=-24, tail=11, so since left-moving, head at x=-24, tail at x=11, but that would mean the car spans from -24 to 11, which is length 35, and moving left.\n\nSpan at t_1: [h, τ] = [-24, 11]? But [h, τ] with h=-24, τ=11, so min to max? The span should be from left to right, so for left-moving, [h, τ] with h < τ typically? In the update, it says [h, τ] for left-moving, but in the shift, it decreases both.\n\nIn this case, at t_1, span is [ -24, 11 ], since h=-24, τ=11.\n\nThen at T, span [ -24 -36Δ, 11 -36Δ] since s=36.\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -24 -36Δ, 11 -36Δ]\n\nSo -24 -36Δ ≤ 0 ≤ 11 -36Δ\n\nFirst inequality: -24 -36Δ ≤ 0 always true since both negative? -24 -36Δ is always <= -24 <0, so left end <=0 always.\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 11 -36Δ ⇒ 11 -36Δ ≥0 ⇒ 36Δ ≤11 ⇒ Δ ≤ 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so only for Δ=0.\n\nAt Δ=0, T=71, span [ -24, 11], which includes 0? -24 ≤ 0 ≤ 11, yes, 0 is between -24 and 11.\n\nSo at T=71, on freeway 4, collision if present.\n\nBut the player starts at turn 71 on y=1, not y=4, so at turn 71, if on y=4, collision, but player is on y=1.\n\nFor future turns.\n\nAt Δ=0, only if at T=71 on y=4.\n\nFor Δ>0, 11-36Δ <11-36= -25<0 for Δ=1, so upper bound negative, 0 not in span.\n\nSo for freeway 4, only collision risk at exactly T=71, if on y=4.\n\nOtherwise, no risk.\n\nFreeway 5: y=5\n\nCars: (-24, 11, left, 36) same as freeway 4.\n\nSo identical, collision only at T=71 if on y=5.\n\nFreeway 6: y=6\n\nCars: (-36, -47, right, 6)\n\nDirection right, head=-36, tail=-47? Tail should be left.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [-47, -36] since τ=-47, h=-36.\n\nAt T: [ -47 +6Δ, -36 +6Δ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -47+6Δ, -36+6Δ]\n\nSo -47+6Δ ≤ 0 ≤ -36+6Δ\n\nFirst: -47+6Δ ≤0 ⇒ 6Δ ≤47 ⇒ Δ ≤ 47/6 ≈7.833, so Δ≤7\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -36+6Δ ⇒ 6Δ ≥36 ⇒ Δ ≥6\n\nSo for Δ=6,7\n\nΔ=6: lower -47+36= -11, upper -36+36=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included\n\nΔ=7: lower -47+42= -5, upper -36+42=6, so [ -5,6], 0 included.\n\nΔ=6: T=71+6=77, span [-11,0]\n\nΔ=7: T=78, span [-5,6]\n\nCollision if on y=6 at T=77 or 78.\n\nFreeway 7: y=7\n\nCars: (56, 45, right, 4) and (8, -3, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: head=56, tail=45, direction right, so span [τ,h] = [45,56]\n\nAt T: [45+4Δ, 56+4Δ], always positive, 0 not in, no collision risk.\n\nSecond car: (8, -3, right, 4) head=8, tail=-3, direction right, span [τ,h] = [-3,8]\n\nAt T: [ -3 +4Δ, 8 +4Δ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -3+4Δ, 8+4Δ]\n\n-3+4Δ ≤0 ≤8+4Δ\n\nFirst: -3+4Δ ≤0 ⇒ 4Δ ≤3 ⇒ Δ ≤ 0.75, so only Δ=0 possible? Δ integer, Δ=0: -3≤0≤8, true.\n\nΔ=1: -3+4=1>0, so lower bound 1>0, 0 not <=1? 0 <1, not in [1,12] for Δ=1.\n\nAt Δ=0, T=71, span [-3,8], 0 in it.\n\nFor Δ>0, lower bound -3+4Δ, at Δ=1, 1>0, so 0 not in [1, 8+4=12].\n\nSo only at T=71, if on y=7, collision.\n\nBut player not on y=7 at 71.\n\nFreeway 8: y=8\n\nCars: (-42, -53, right, 3)\n\nHead=-42, tail=-53, direction right, span [τ,h] = [-53, -42]\n\nAt T: [ -53 +3Δ, -42 +3Δ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -53+3Δ, -42+3Δ]\n\n-53+3Δ ≤0 ≤ -42+3Δ\n\nFirst: -53+3Δ ≤0 ⇒ 3Δ ≤53 ⇒ Δ ≤ 53/3 ≈17.666, Δ≤17\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -42+3Δ ⇒ 3Δ ≥42 ⇒ Δ ≥14\n\nSo for Δ=14 to 17\n\nΔ=14: lower -53+42= -11, upper -42+42=0, [ -11,0], 0 included\n\nΔ=15: lower -53+45= -8, upper -42+45=3, [ -8,3], 0 in\n\nΔ=16: lower -53+48= -5, upper -42+48=6, [ -5,6], 0 in\n\nΔ=17: lower -53+51= -2, upper -42+51=9, [ -2,9], 0 in\n\nCollision if on y=8 at T=71+14=85, 86,87,88.\n\nNow, player starts at y=1, turn 71.\n\nGoal: reach y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so no collision there.\n\nWe need to go from y=1 to y=9, moving up or down or stay, but since we start at 1 and need to go to 9, we should move up mostly, but need to avoid collisions at intermediate freeways at certain times.\n\nSince we want min turns, we should move up as fast as possible, but might need to wait or move down to avoid collisions.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, D decreases, S same.\n\nFrom y=1 to y=9, min steps without obstacles would be 8 steps (e.g., U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U to go to y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 in 8 turns).\n\nBut with collisions, we need to avoid being on certain y at certain t.\n\nNow, collision points:\n\nSummarize dangerous (y,t) pairs:\n\n- y=2: collision only at t=75 (from freeway 2 car 1)\n\n- y=3: same, only at t=75\n\n- y=4: collision at t=71\n\n- y=5: collision at t=71\n\n- y=6: collision at t=77 and t=78\n\n- y=7: collision at t=71\n\n- y=8: collision at t=85,86,87,88\n\nAt other times, these freeways are safe, I think, but need to confirm if there are other cars or not.\n\nFor example, freeway 2 has two cars, but we saw only one causes issue at t=75.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nFreeway 1 no issue, freeway 7 first car no issue, etc.\n\nNow, player starts at t=71, y=1.\n\ny=1 is safe, as we saw no collision.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe always.\n\nNow, the dangerous times are close to start: t=71 for y=4,5,7; and later t=75 for y=2,3; t=77,78 for y=6; t=85-88 for y=8.\n\nBut t=85 is far, since from t=71, Δ=14, so we might reach y=9 before that if we move fast.\n\nMin steps to go up: from y=1 to y=9, need +8 in y, so at least 8 turns if all U.\n\nBut we might need to delay to avoid collisions.\n\nSince we start at t=71, y=1.\n\nAt t=71, we are on y=1, safe.\n\nNow, we can choose action for turn 71: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, go to y=2 at next turn, but at turn 71, after action, position for turn 72.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, player position is y_t.\n\nAction a_t determines Δy for t to t+1, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t, we check collision based on y_t and the cars at turn t.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t+1, based on y_{t+1} and cars at t+1.\n\nSo sequence:\n\n- At turn t=71: position y=1, check collision for y=1 at t=71: safe, as we saw.\n\nThen we take action a_{71}, which affects y_{72}.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nWe need to find actions from t=71 to t_{71 + H -1} such that at turn t_{71 + H -1}, y=9.\n\nThe position at turn T is after the action from T-1 to T.\n\nStart: turn t=71, y_{71} =1\n\nAfter action a_{71}, y_{72} = y_{71} + Δy_{71}\n\nThen at turn t=72, position y_{72}, check collision based on y_{72} and cars at t=72.\n\nAnd so on, until some turn T where y_T =9.\n\nH is the number of turns from t=71 to the turn when we reach y=9, so the sequence of actions from t=71 to t=71 + H -1, and at turn t=71 + H -1, y=9? Let's see.\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at turn T. That means y_T =9.\n\ny_T is set by the action at turn T-1.\n\nThe actions are for turns t=71, t=72, ..., up to the action that sets y to 9.\n\nIf at turn T-1, we take action such that y_T = y_{T-1} + Δy_{T-1} =9.\n\nThen the last action is at turn T-1.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=71 to t=71 + H -1, and after H actions, we are at turn t=71 + H, with y_{71+H} =9? Let's define.\n\nSet t_index: let t=71 be turn 0 for simplicity, but maybe keep absolute.\n\nSet τ = t - 71, so relative turn.\n\nAt τ=0, turn 71, y=1.\n\nAction a_{71} at τ=0 affects y at τ=1.\n\nGenerally, at relative time τ (after τ actions?).\n\nAt absolute turn T, relative Δ = T - 71.\n\nPosition y at turn T=71 + δ, for δ=0,1,2,...\n\ny_{71+δ} depends on actions from δ=0 to δ-1? Let's see.\n\nAt δ=0, turn 71, y_{71} =1, fixed.\n\nAfter action a_{71} (at turn 71), y_{72} = y_{71} + Δy_{71}\n\nAfter action a_{72}, y_{73} = y_{72} + Δy_{72}, and so on.\n\nSo y at turn 71+δ is determined by actions a_{71} to a_{71+δ-1}, with y_{71} =1.\n\ny_{71+δ} = 1 + sum_{k=0}^{δ-1} Δy_{71+k}\n\nAnd we want y_{71+H} =9 for some H, meaning after H actions, at turn 71+H, y=9.\n\nThe actions are a_{71} to a_{71+H-1}, H actions in total.\n\nThen y_{71+H} =9.\n\nNow, collision at each turn t=71+δ for δ=0,1,2,... if y_{71+δ} between 1 and 8, and 0 in car span for that freeway at that turn.\n\nAt turn t=71+δ, position y_{71+δ}, if y_{71+δ} = k for k=1 to 8, then check if collision on freeway k at time t=71+δ.\n\nIf y=0 or y=9, no freeway, no collision, but y=0 is bottom, y=9 top, no cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, but we start from y=1, go to y=9, so y=0 might be used to wait or something.\n\ny can be 0, but we need to reach 9.\n\nNow back to min H.\n\nWith no obstacles, min H=8, with all U actions, reaching y=9 at turn 79.\n\nBut with collisions, we need to avoid being at dangerous points.\n\nList dangerous (y,t) pairs:\n\nt absolute, y.\n\n- At t=71: y=4,5,7 dangerous (collision)\n\n- At t=75: y=2,3 dangerous\n\n- At t=77: y=6 dangerous\n\n- At t=78: y=6 dangerous\n\n- At t=85 to 88: y=8 dangerous\n\nOther times, all y=1 to 8 are safe, except possibly if multiple cars, but we covered all.\n\nFor example, freeway 2 only dangerous at t=75, etc.\n\nNow, since t=85 is late, if we move fast, we can reach y=9 before t=85.\n\nt=85 is Δ=14, turn 71+14=85.\n\nIf we go all up from t=71, we reach y=9 at t=79 (since y71=1, after 8 actions U, y79=9).\n\nt=79 is before t=85, so y=8 dangerous at t=85-88 is not an issue if we are at y=9 by t=79.\n\nSimilarly, other late times.\n\nBut we have earlier dangers.\n\nWe need to go from y=1 at t=71 to y=9.\n\nPossible path: start at t=71, y=1.\n\nWe can take actions.\n\nIf we go directly up:\n\nSuppose all U:\n\nTurn 71: a=U, then y72 = y71 +1 =2 (at turn 72)\n\nAt turn 72, y=2, now t=72, is it dangerous? t=72, y=2. From above, y=2 dangerous only at t=75. t=72 not 75, so safe.\n\nTurn 72: a=U, y73=3, at turn 73, y=3, not t=75, safe.\n\nTurn 73: a=U, y74=4, at turn 74, y=4.\n\nNow t=74, y=4. Dangerous at t=71, but t=74 not 71, so safe? Earlier we said y=4 collision only at t=71. At other times, no car causes issue? Freeway 4 has only that car, which at t=71 span includes 0, but at t=74, Δ=3, span [ -24 -36*3, 11-36*3] = [ -24-108, 11-108] = [-132, -97], all negative, 0 not in, so safe. Similarly for y=5.\n\nAt turn 74, y=4, safe.\n\nTurn 74: a=U, y75=5, at turn 75, y=5.\n\nt=75, y=5. Now y=5 dangerous? y=5 collision only at t=71. At t=75, Δ=4, for freeway 5 car, span [ -24 -36*4, 11-36*4] = [ -24-144, 11-144] = [-168,-133], no 0, safe.\n\nBut at t=75, y=2 and y=3 are dangerous, but we are at y=5.\n\ny=5 at t=75 is safe.\n\nThen turn 75: a=U, y76=6, at turn 76, y=6.\n\nt=76, y=6. Dangerous at t=77 and 78, not 76. Freeway 6: at t=76, Δ=5, span [ -47+6*5, -36+6*5] = [-47+30, -36+30] = [-17, -6], all negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 76: a=U, y77=7, at turn 77, y=7.\n\nt=77, y=7. Dangerous? y=7 collision only at t=71. At t=77, Δ=6, freeway 7 second car span [ -3+4*6, 8+4*6] = [-3+24,8+24]=[21,32], no 0, safe. First car not issue.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTurn 77: a=U, y78=8, at turn 78, y=8.\n\nt=78, y=8. Now dangerous times for y=8 are t=85-88, t=78 is earlier, not dangerous. Freeway 8 at t=78, Δ=7, span [ -53+3*7, -42+3*7] = [-53+21, -42+21] = [-32,-21], no 0, safe.\n\nThen turn 78: a=U, y79=9, at turn 79, y=9, goal, no collision.\n\nSo with all U actions: a71=U, a72=U, a73=U, a74=U, a75=U, a76=U, a77=U, a78=U.\n\ny at each turn:\n\nt=71: y=1, safe\n\nt=72: y=2, safe (since not 75)\n\nt=73: y=3, safe (not 75)\n\nt=74: y=4, safe (not 71)\n\nt=75: y=5, safe (not 71, and y=5 safe at t=75)\n\nt=76: y=6, safe (not 77 or 78)\n\nt=77: y=7, safe (not 71)\n\nt=78: y=8, safe (not 85-88)\n\nt=79: y=9, goal.\n\nH=8 actions from t=71 to t=78, reach y=9 at t=79.\n\nBut is there a collision at t=75? At t=75, we are at y=5, which is not dangerous; dangerous are y=2 and y=3 at t=75.\n\nSimilarly, all safe.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 6 at t=77 and 78 dangerous, but we are at y=7 at t=77 and y=8 at t=78, not on y=6.\n\nAt t=77, we are on y=7, which is safe, not on y=6.\n\nSimilarly t=78 on y=8 safe.\n\nSo seems no collision, and min H=8.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we did in 8 turns.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nWhat about the player moving: when we move from y to y+1, at turn T, we are on y, then after action, at T+1 on y+1.\n\nIn this case, at no point are we on a dangerous spot.\n\nBut let me list the positions:\n\nTurn | y | safe? | note\n\nt=71 | 1 | yes | \n\nt=72 | 2 | yes | not t=75\n\nt=73 | 3 | yes | not t=75\n\nt=74 | 4 | yes | not t=71\n\nt=75 | 5 | yes | not t=71, and freeway 5 safe at t=75\n\nt=76 | 6 | yes | not t=77 or 78\n\nt=77 | 7 | yes | not t=71\n\nt=78 | 8 | yes | not t=85-88\n\nt=79 | 9 | goal\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is freeway 5 safe at t=75? Yes, as calculated.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nPerhaps we can do with H=7? But from y=1 to y=9, min 8 steps since each step changes by at most 1. y1 to y9, delta=8, so min 8 actions needed. Cannot in 7.\n\nSo H=8 is minimum possible.\n\nAnd we achieved with all U.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 2,3 at t=75 dangerous, but we are not there.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nBut let me check if at t=75, y=5 is indeed safe.\n\nFreeway 5: car (-24,11,left,36) at t=75, Δ=75-71=4, span [ -24 -36*4, 11-36*4] = [-24-144, 11-144] = [-168, -133], min x=-168, max x=-133, both <0, so 0 not in span, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 same.\n\nFreeway 6 at t=76: Δ=5, span [-47+30, -36+30]=[-17,-6], no 0.\n\nt=77: y=7, freeway 7: second car at Δ=6, span [-3+24,8+24]=[21,32], no 0; first car [45+24,56+24]=[69,80], no.\n\nt=78: y=8, freeway 8 at Δ=7, span [-53+21, -42+21]=[-32,-21], no 0.\n\nAll fine.\n\nBut in the initial state, at t=71, y=1 is safe, but we didn't stay.\n\nNow, but the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in this case H=8.\n\nBut let me see if there is a reason we need to avoid something.\n\nPerhaps I missed a collision point.\n\nFor freeway 6, dangerous at t=77 and 78.\n\nIn the path, at t=76 we are on y=6, which is safe, then move to y=7 at t=77.\n\nAt t=77, on y=7, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother thing: when we move, if we move to a different y, we are not on that y until the next turn.\n\nFor example, at turn t, if we take action to move to y+1, at turn t we are still on y, and at turn t+1 on y+1.\n\nIn collision check, at each turn, we check based on current y at that turn.\n\nSo in the path above, all good.\n\nPerhaps for y=8 at later times, but we are before.\n\nSo min H=8 with all U.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,1), and we go directly to (0,9) in 8 turns.\n\nNow, the sequence: actions from t=71 to t=78.\n\na_{71} to a_{78}, all U.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbering.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=71, position (0,1)\n\nAfter H turns, we reach at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions: {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1 +0} to a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nThen after these H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is 9.\n\nIn this case, H=8, actions a_{71} to a_{78}, then at turn 79, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\n...\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nBut H=8.\n\nBut is there a shorter way? No, as min 8 steps.\n\nPerhaps with some down or stay, but that would take more turns, not less.\n\nSo min H=8.\n\nBut let me see the cars again.\n\nFor freeway 7, at t=71, there is a car (8,-3,right,4), which at t=71 has span [-3,8], includes 0, so if at t=71 on y=7, collision, but we are not.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=7 at t=77, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps the player can go faster? No.\n\nOr start by staying, but that would increase H.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\", and in this case, no collision.\n\nBut let me check if at any point we are on a freeway when 0 is in span.\n\nFor example, at t=75, we are on y=5, freeway 5, car span at t=75 is [-168,-133], not include 0.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps I miscomputed the car spans.\n\nAnother thing: for freeway 2 and 3, at t=75, collision, but we are on y=5 at that time.\n\ny=5 is different freeway.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 8, with all U actions.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nThen at turn 79, y=9.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed as above.\n\nBut the boxed format.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut let me see if we can reach earlier? From y=1, to y=9, min 8 steps, cannot earlier.\n\nStart at y=1, after one step min y=0 or 2, max y=2 if U, but y=0 possible but not helpful.\n\nAfter k steps, y between max(0,1-k) and min(9,1+k), but to reach 9, need at least 8 steps.\n\nSo H=8 is min.\n\nThus, this should be the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 71\\) is 8, achieved by moving up (U) at every turn. This sequence avoids all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), as verified by checking the player's position and car spans at each turn.\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance:\n- **Turn 71 (\\(y = 1\\))**: Freeway 1 is safe (no collision at any turn).\n- **Turn 72 (\\(y = 2\\))**: Freeway 2 is dangerous only at turn 75; at turn 72, it is safe.\n- **Turn 73 (\\(y = 3\\))**: Freeway 3 is dangerous only at turn 75; at turn 73, it is safe.\n- **Turn 74 (\\(y = 4\\))**: Freeway 4 is dangerous only at turn 71; at turn 74, it is safe.\n- **Turn 75 (\\(y = 5\\))**: Freeway 5 is dangerous only at turn 71; at turn 75, it is safe.\n- **Turn 76 (\\(y = 6\\))**: Freeway 6 is dangerous at turns 77 and 78; at turn 76, it is safe.\n- **Turn 77 (\\(y = 7\\))**: Freeway 7 is dangerous only at turn 71; at turn 77, it is safe.\n- **Turn 78 (\\(y = 8\\))**: Freeway 8 is dangerous at turns 85–88; at turn 78, it is safe.\n- **Turn 79 (\\(y = 9\\))**: Goal reached; no freeway at \\(y = 9\\), so no collision possible.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns 71 to 78 ensures the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 79 with \\(H = 8\\) turns, which is minimal since at least 8 moves are required to increase \\(y\\) from 1 to 9 with steps of +1.\n\n### Sequence of Actions:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 71: U \\\\\nTurn 72: U \\\\\nTurn 73: U \\\\\nTurn 74: U \\\\\nTurn 75: U \\\\\nTurn 76: U \\\\\nTurn 77: U \\\\\nTurn 78: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 2) at turn t_1 = 72. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each turn, the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes over time based on the car's direction and speed.\n\nImportant note: if the player moves to a different y at turn T, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, they are on y_T, and if they move, they will be on y_{T+1} at turn T+1, but not during turn T. So for collision, at turn T, we only care about cars on the current freeway y_T.\n\nThe player position at turn T is (0, y_T), and we need to check for cars on freeway i = y_T at that turn T.\n\nCar spans are given at turn t_1=72, and we need to compute their positions at future turns T > t_1.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t = 72.\n\nPlayer starts at y_{72} = 2.\n\nWe need to find actions from t=72 to some t=72 + H - 1, such that y_{72 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nH is the number of turns, so actions from t=72 to t=72 + H - 1, and position at turn 72 + H - 1 is 9.\n\nSince y changes by at most 1 per turn, the minimal H to go from y=2 to y=9 is at least 7 turns, since 9-2=7, so if we move up every turn, we can reach in 7 turns. But we have to avoid collisions, so it might take more if there are obstacles.\n\nBut we might need to wait or go down sometimes to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, I need to model the car positions over time.\n\nFor each freeway, there are cars with head, tail, direction, speed at t=72.\n\nDirection: left or right. In the span notation, for left-moving, head and tail decrease over time, for right-moving, they increase.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (96, 49, right, 48)\n\nSince direction right, it's moving right, so head and tail increase over time.\n\nAt turn T, span is [τ + s*(T-t), h + s*(T-t)] for right-moving, based on the update rule.\n\nFrom the update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t), τ - s*(T-t)]\n\nBut h and τ are given at t=72.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 2, it has two cars: (-36, -47, right, 12) and (36, 25, right, 12)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI need to know when 0 is covered by a car on a freeway at a given turn.\n\nCollision if player is on freeway i at turn T, and for that freeway, there exists a car where 0 is in [span_start, span_end] at turn T.\n\nThe span is a interval, and we need 0 to be within that interval.\n\nSince the player is at x=0, and cars are on the freeway, which I assume is at y=i, but x-position matters.\n\nThe grid is 2D, but player is always at x=0, and freeways are horizontal, so cars move horizontally, player moves vertically.\n\nSo for collision, at turn T, if player is at (0, i), and there is a car on freeway i that covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nSo we need to find for each freeway i, and for each turn T, whether x=0 is occupied by any car on that freeway.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, we need to check all cars on that freeway for each turn.\n\nFirst, let's define the time relative to t_1=72.\n\nSet τ = T - 72, so τ=0 is current turn.\n\nFor turn T, τ = T - 72.\n\nNow, for each car, given its state at τ=0, find its span at τ.\n\nThen, for a given freeway i and time τ, collision if there is a car on i such that 0 in [low, high] of its span.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (h=96, τ=49, d=right, s=48) at τ=0.\n\nτ is tail, but I used τ for time, bad choice. Let me use t_rel for time relative.\n\nSet t_rel = T - 72.\n\nAt t_rel=0, car: head=96, tail=49, d=right, s=48.\n\nSince right-moving, at time t_rel, span = [tail + s*t_rel, head + s*t_rel] = [49 + 48*t_rel, 96 + 48*t_rel]\n\nFor right-moving, from update: [τ + s*(T-t), h + s*(T-t)] = [49 + 48*t_rel, 96 + 48*t_rel]\n\nYes.\n\nWe need 0 in this interval: 49 + 48*t_rel ≤ 0 ≤ 96 + 48*t_rel\n\nBut 49 + 48*t_rel is always positive for t_rel ≥ 0, since 49>0, and increasing, so 49 + 48*t_rel >0 for all t_rel ≥0, so 0 is never in this interval because the lower bound is at least 49>0. So this car never covers x=0 for t_rel ≥0. So on freeway 1, no collision possible at any time. Good.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (h=-36, τ=-47, d=right, s=12) at t_rel=0.\n\nDirection right, so span at t_rel: [τ + s*t_rel, h + s*t_rel] = [-47 + 12*t_rel, -36 + 12*t_rel]\n\nWe need -47 + 12*t_rel ≤ 0 ≤ -36 + 12*t_rel\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 2: (h=36, τ=25, d=right, s=12)\n\nSpan: [25 + 12*t_rel, 36 + 12*t_rel]\n\nNow, for freeway 2, collision if either car covers 0 at time t_rel.\n\nFirst car: -47 + 12*t_rel ≤ 0 ≤ -36 + 12*t_rel\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nLeft: -47 + 12*t_rel ≤ 0 ⇒ 12*t_rel ≤ 47 ⇒ t_rel ≤ 47/12 ≈ 3.916\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -36 + 12*t_rel ⇒ 36 ≤ 12*t_rel ⇒ t_rel ≥ 3\n\nSo for t_rel between 3 and 3.916, approximately.\n\nt_rel integer since turns are discrete.\n\nt_rel ≥0 integer.\n\nt_rel ≥3 and t_rel ≤ floor(47/12) = 47/12=3.916, so t_rel ≤3 since integer? 12*3=36, 12*4=48.\n\nt_rel ≥ ceil(36/12)= ceil(3)=3\n\nt_rel ≤ floor(47/12)= floor(3.916)=3\n\n47/12=3.916, floor is 3.\n\nBut t_rel ≤3 and t_rel ≥3, so only at t_rel=3.\n\nCheck:\n\nAt t_rel=3:\n\nLower bound: -47 + 12*3 = -47 + 36 = -11\n\nUpper bound: -36 + 12*3 = -36 + 36 = 0\n\nSo span: [-11, 0]\n\n0 is included, since upper bound is 0.\n\n0 ≤ 0 is true.\n\nSo at t_rel=3, 0 is covered.\n\nNow second car: [25 + 12*t_rel, 36 + 12*t_rel]\n\n25 +12*t_rel >0 for t_rel≥0, so 0 not in [positive, positive], so never covers 0.\n\nThus on freeway 2, collision only at t_rel=3.\n\nt_rel=3 means turn T=72+3=75.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"3 | (-36, -47, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12) |\"\n\nIdentical to freeway 2. So same thing, collision only at t_rel=3.\n\nNow freeway 4: \"4 | (-60, -25, left, 36) |\"\n\nOne car: (h=-60, τ=-25, d=left, s=36)\n\nDirection left, so from update rule: left-moving, span(T) = [h - s*(T-t), τ - s*(T-t)] = [-60 - 36*t_rel, -25 - 36*t_rel]\n\nh is head, which for left-moving, at t_rel=0, head=-60, tail=-25.\n\nIn the update: for left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t), τ - s*(T-t)]\n\nSo at t_rel, [ -60 - 36*t_rel, -25 - 36*t_rel ]\n\nNow, we need 0 in this interval: -60 -36*t_rel ≤ 0 ≤ -25 -36*t_rel\n\nSince the car is moving left, positions decreasing.\n\nLeft inequality: -60 -36*t_rel ≤ 0 ⇒ -36*t_rel ≤ 60 ⇒ t_rel ≥ -60/36? But t_rel ≥0, and -60 -36*t_rel is always negative, so ≤0 always true for t_rel≥0.\n\nRight inequality: 0 ≤ -25 -36*t_rel ⇒ 0 ≤ -25 -36*t_rel, which is 25 + 36*t_rel ≤ 0, but 25>0, so impossible for t_rel≥0.\n\nThus, 0 ≤ -25 -36*t_rel is always false for t_rel≥0.\n\nTherefore, no solution, so 0 never covered by this car.\n\nFreeway 4: no collision at any time.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as freeway 4? \"5 | (-60, -25, left, 36) |\" identical, so no collision.\n\nNow freeway 6: \"6 | (-30, -41, right, 6) |\"\n\nOne car: (h=-30, τ=-41, d=right, s=6)\n\nDirection right, so span at t_rel: [τ + s*t_rel, h + s*t_rel] = [-41 + 6*t_rel, -30 + 6*t_rel]\n\nNeed 0 in this: -41 +6*t_rel ≤ 0 ≤ -30 +6*t_rel\n\nLeft: -41 +6*t_rel ≤ 0 ⇒ 6*t_rel ≤ 41 ⇒ t_rel ≤ 41/6 ≈6.833\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -30 +6*t_rel ⇒ 30 ≤ 6*t_rel ⇒ t_rel ≥ 5\n\nSo t_rel from 5 to 6.833, integer t_rel=5,6\n\nAt t_rel=5: lower= -41+30= -11, upper= -30+30=0, so [-11,0], 0 covered.\n\nt_rel=6: lower= -41+36= -5, upper= -30+36=6, so [-5,6], 0 covered.\n\nt_rel=7: lower= -41+42=1, upper= -30+42=12, [1,12], 0 not covered.\n\nSo collision at t_rel=5 and 6.\n\nFreeway 7: \"7 | (60, 49, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4) |\"\n\nTwo cars.\n\nFirst car: (h=60, τ=49, d=right, s=4) → span [49 +4*t_rel, 60 +4*t_rel], always positive, 0 not covered.\n\nSecond car: (h=12, τ=1, d=right, s=4) → span [1 +4*t_rel, 12 +4*t_rel], also always positive for t_rel≥0, 0 not covered.\n\nSo freeway 7: no collision at any time.\n\nFreeway 8: \"8 | (-39, -50, right, 3) |\"\n\nOne car: (h=-39, τ=-50, d=right, s=3)\n\nSpan: [τ + s*t_rel, h + s*t_rel] = [-50 + 3*t_rel, -39 + 3*t_rel]\n\nNeed 0 in this: -50 +3*t_rel ≤ 0 ≤ -39 +3*t_rel\n\nLeft: -50 +3*t_rel ≤ 0 ⇒ 3*t_rel ≤ 50 ⇒ t_rel ≤ 50/3 ≈16.666\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -39 +3*t_rel ⇒ 39 ≤ 3*t_rel ⇒ t_rel ≥ 13\n\nSo t_rel from 13 to 16.666, integer t_rel=13,14,15,16\n\nAt t_rel=13: lower= -50+39= -11, upper= -39+39=0, [-11,0], 0 covered.\n\nt_rel=14: lower= -50+42= -8, upper= -39+42=3, [-8,3], 0 covered.\n\nt_rel=15: lower= -50+45= -5, upper= -39+45=6, [-5,6], 0 covered.\n\nt_rel=16: lower= -50+48= -2, upper= -39+48=9, [-2,9], 0 covered.\n\nt_rel=17: lower= -50+51=1, upper= -39+51=12, [1,12], 0 not covered.\n\nSo collision at t_rel=13,14,15,16.\n\nNow, summarize collision times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: never\n\n- Freeway 2: t_rel=3\n\n- Freeway 3: t_rel=3\n\n- Freeway 4: never\n\n- Freeway 5: never\n\n- Freeway 6: t_rel=5,6\n\n- Freeway 7: never\n\n- Freeway 8: t_rel=13,14,15,16\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at t_rel=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1.\n\nMinimal H: if no obstacles, from y=2 to y=9, need 7 steps up, so H=7.\n\nBut with obstacles, we need to avoid being on a freeway when it has collision.\n\nSpecifically, at each turn t_rel, if player is on freeway i, then if i has collision at that t_rel, we crash.\n\nBut if we move to a different y, at that turn we are still on the previous y until the move.\n\nLet me denote the turn: at time t_rel, player position y_{t_rel}, and we take action a_{t_rel} which determines y_{t_rel+1}.\n\nBut for collision, at turn t_rel, we are on y_{t_rel}, and we check if freeway y_{t_rel} has collision at t_rel.\n\nThen after action, at next turn, we are on new position.\n\nPlayer starts at t_rel=0, y=2.\n\nAction a_0 at t_rel=0 determines y_1.\n\nSimilarly, at t_rel=1, position y_1, and so on.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions such that for all t_rel, when at position y_{t_rel}, there is no collision on freeway y_{t_rel} at time t_rel.\n\nAnd finally, after H actions, we are at y_H = 9, but positions: after H actions, we have positions from t_rel=0 to t_rel=H, but H actions from t=0 to H-1, position at t=H is the result.\n\nSet t_rel from 0 to H.\n\nAt time t_rel, position y_{t_rel}, set by previous actions.\n\nActions taken at t_rel determine y_{t_rel+1}.\n\nSpecifically: at turn t_rel, we are at y_{t_rel}, then we choose action a_{t_rel}, which sets y_{t_rel+1} = y_{t_rel} + Δy, with Δy based on a.\n\nThen at the next turn, t_rel+1, we are at y_{t_rel+1}, and so on.\n\nThe sequence of positions: y_0, y_1, ..., y_H.\n\nWith y_0 given, and y_H =9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t_rel=0 to t_rel=H-1, so H actions, positions from t_rel=0 to t_rel=H.\n\ny_H is after H actions.\n\nIn the problem, turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, actions.\n\nPosition at turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, but at turn T, position is y_T.\n\nIn terms of t_rel: for t_rel from 0 to H-1, position y_{t_rel}, and after action at t_rel, y_{t_rel+1}.\n\nWe need y_{t_rel} for t_rel=0 to H-1, and at turn t_rel, we are on freeway y_{t_rel}, so must be safe at that time.\n\nThen at the last action, we reach y_H=9 at turn H.\n\nBut the turn when we are at y=9 is turn t_rel=H, and we need to ensure that at that turn, if we are on freeway 9, but freeway 9 is not listed, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 should be safe, no cars. Similarly y=0, but we start from y=2, going to y=9, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no freeways, so no collision possible. So when at y=0 or y=9, always safe.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, y=9 is the goal, so when we reach it, no issue.\n\nNow back to path.\n\nPlayer starts at y_0=2.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, with minimal H such that y_H=9.\n\nH actions from t_rel=0 to H-1, so y_H is position after H steps.\n\nThe positions from t_rel=0 to H must be safe, meaning for each t_rel from 0 to H-1, at position y_{t_rel}, freeway y_{t_rel} has no collision at time t_rel.\n\nAt turn t_rel, position y_{t_rel}, which is set, and we check collision for that freeway at that time.\n\nThen at turn H, position y_H=9, which is safe as no freeway.\n\nBut for the sequence, we only care up to turn H-1 for actions, and position at H.\n\nIn terms of collision check, we need to check from t_rel=0 to t_rel=H-1, since at those turns, player is on some freeway (unless y=0 or 9, but y=0 might be possible, but here y=2 to 9, all between 1 and 8 except possibly ends, but y=0 and 9 safe).\n\ny=0: if player is at y=0, no freeway, so safe. Similarly y=9.\n\nBut in this path, we start from y=2, which is freeway 2, and go to y=9.\n\nNow freeway 2 has collision at t_rel=3 only.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nNow, the dangerous freeways and times:\n\n- Freeway 2: collision at t_rel=3\n\n- Freeway 3: collision at t_rel=3\n\n- Freeway 6: collision at t_rel=5 and 6\n\n- Freeway 8: collision at t_rel=13,14,15,16\n\nOther freeways always safe.\n\nNow, player starts at y=2 at t_rel=0.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nMinimal H: 7 actions to go up 7 times.\n\nBut let's see if we can go directly up without hitting collisions.\n\nPath: start at y_0=2.\n\nAt t_rel=0, position y=2. Freeway 2, at t_rel=0: is there collision? From above, freeway 2 collision only at t_rel=3, not at 0. So safe.\n\nThen we can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf we go up, to y=3.\n\nBut at t_rel=1, position y=3.\n\nFreeway 3 at t_rel=1: collision? Freeway 3 collision only at t_rel=3, not at 1. So safe.\n\nThen to y=4, and so on.\n\nBut we need to check future times.\n\nLet's simulate minimal path: always up.\n\nActions: all U.\n\nThen positions:\n\nt_rel | y | freeway | collision at t_rel?\n\n0 | 2 | 2 | collision at t_rel=3? No, at t_rel=0, freeway 2 safe.\n\n1 | 3 | 3 | at t_rel=1, freeway 3 safe, collision only at t_rel=3.\n\n2 | 4 | 4 | freeway 4 always safe, no issue.\n\n3 | 5 | 5 | freeway 5 always safe.\n\n4 | 6 | 6 | freeway 6 at t_rel=4: collision? Freeway 6 collision at t_rel=5 and 6, not at 4. So safe.\n\nt_rel=4, y=6, freeway 6 at time t_rel=4: no collision, since collision at 5 and 6.\n\n5 | 6? After action at t_rel=4, if we go up, y=7.\n\nList:\n\nAfter action at t_rel, y_{t_rel+1}\n\nSet timeline:\n\nt_rel | position y | freeway at this turn | collision?\n\nt_rel=0: y=2, freeway 2, collision at t_rel=0? No, as per above. Safe.\n\nAction a0: say U, then y1=3\n\nt_rel=1: position y=3, freeway 3, at time t_rel=1. Collision? Freeway 3 collision only at t_rel=3, not 1. Safe.\n\nAction a1: U, y2=4\n\nt_rel=2: y=4, freeway 4, always safe. Safe.\n\nAction a2: U, y3=5\n\nt_rel=3: y=5, freeway 5, always safe. Safe.\n\nAction a3: U, y4=6\n\nt_rel=4: y=6, freeway 6, at t_rel=4. Collision? Freeway 6 collision at t_rel=5 and 6, not 4. Safe.\n\nAction a4: U, y5=7\n\nt_rel=5: y=7, freeway 7, always safe (no collision). Safe.\n\nBut freeway 6 at t_rel=5: but we are not on freeway 6 at t_rel=5, we are on y=7.\n\nt_rel=5: position y=7, so freeway 7, safe.\n\nAction a5: U, y6=8\n\nt_rel=6: y=8, freeway 8, at t_rel=6.\n\nFreeway 8 collision at t_rel=13,14,15,16? t_rel=6 is less than 13, so no collision? Freeway 8 collision at t_rel=13 to 16, not at 6. So safe.\n\nAction a6: U, y7=9\n\nt_rel=7: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nWe reached y=9 at t_rel=7.\n\nIn terms of turns: t_rel from 0 to 7, positions y0 to y7.\n\ny0=2, y1=3, y2=4, y3=5, y4=6, y5=7, y6=8, y7=9.\n\nNow, collision check:\n\nt_rel=0: y=2, freeway 2 safe (collision only at t_rel=3)\n\nt_rel=1: y=3, freeway 3 safe (collision only at t_rel=3)\n\nt_rel=2: y=4, freeway 4 safe\n\nt_rel=3: y=5, freeway 5 safe\n\nt_rel=4: y=6, freeway 6 at t_rel=4: no collision (collision at 5 and 6)\n\nt_rel=5: y=7, freeway 7 safe\n\nt_rel=6: y=8, freeway 8 at t_rel=6: collision only from t_rel=13, so safe\n\nt_rel=7: y=9, safe\n\nAll safe? But at t_rel=5 and t_rel=6, we are on freeway 7 and 8, which are safe, but freeway 6 has collision at t_rel=5 and 6, but we are not on it at that time.\n\nIn this path, we are on freeway 6 only at t_rel=4, which is safe.\n\nThen at t_rel=5, we are on freeway 7, safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nBut freeway 6 collision at t_rel=5 and 6, but since we left freeway 6 before that, we are fine.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 collision much later.\n\nSo with H=7, we can reach directly.\n\nBut t_rel=7, so after 7 actions, from t_rel=0 to 6, actions, position at t_rel=7.\n\nNumber of turns: from turn 72 to turn 72+7=79? Let's see.\n\nt_1 =72, actions from t=72 to t=72+H-1.\n\nIn t_rel, actions from t_rel=0 to H-1, position at t_rel=H.\n\nWe need position at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's clarify.\n\nThe turn: at turn t_1 + t for t=0,1,2,...,H-1.\n\nPosition at that turn is y_{t_1 + t}.\n\nAfter H actions, the last position is at turn t_1 + (H-1), and it should be (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t_1 + t, action a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAnd position at turn t_1 + t is given.\n\nWe need the position at turn t_1 + (H-1) to be 9.\n\nIn t_rel: let t be the offset, t=0 to H-1.\n\nAt turn t_1 + t, position y_t (relative to start).\n\ny_0 =2, and after action at turn t_1 + t, y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nBut at turn t_1 + t, position is y_t.\n\nThen after action a_t, y_{t+1} for turn t_1 + (t+1).\n\nWe need that at some turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, position y_t, and we need y_{H-1} =9? No.\n\nAfter H actions, the last action is at turn t_1 + (H-1), which sets position for turn t_1 + H? Let's index properly.\n\nDefine: let k = t, from 0 to H-1.\n\nAt turn T_k = t_1 + k, position is y_k.\n\nWe choose action a_k which determines y_{k+1} for the next turn.\n\nAfter action at T_{H-1} = t_1 + H -1, we have position y_H for turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut we need to reach (0,9) at some turn, so at turn T, position (0,9).\n\nThe turn when we are at (0,9) should be one of the turns from t_1 to t_1 + H-1? No.\n\nThe actions are taken from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -1, so the positions are from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t_1, position is given, y=2.\n\nThen we take action a_{t_1}, which affects position at turn t_1 +1.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t_1 +1, position y_{t_1+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter taking action at turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, the position at turn t_1 + H is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H} =9, and for all turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, the position at that turn must be safe (no collision).\n\nThe minimal H such that we can have y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn T from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, position y_T must be safe.\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn my earlier simulation, with all up:\n\nAt turn t_1 (t_rel=0), y=2, safe.\n\nAction U.\n\nAt turn t_1 +1 (t_rel=1), y=3, safe.\n\nAction U.\n\nAt turn t_1 +2 (t_rel=2), y=4, safe.\n\nAction U.\n\nAt turn t_1 +3 (t_rel=3), y=5, safe.\n\nAction U.\n\nAt turn t_1 +4 (t_rel=4), y=6, safe.\n\nAction U.\n\nAt turn t_1 +5 (t_rel=5), y=7, safe.\n\nAction U.\n\nAt turn t_1 +6 (t_rel=6), y=8, safe.\n\nAction U.\n\nNow at turn t_1 +7 (t_rel=7), y=9, which is the goal.\n\nWe have taken 7 actions: from t_1 to t_1+6.\n\nH=7 actions.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + H = t_1 +7 is y=9.\n\nAnd for turns t_1 to t_1+6, all positions were safe as above.\n\nIn this path, at no point were we on a freeway at a collision time.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At t_rel=0, y=2, not collision time (t_rel=3)\n\n- t_rel=1, y=3, not collision time (t_rel=3)\n\n- t_rel=2, y=4, safe\n\n- t_rel=3, y=5, safe\n\n- t_rel=4, y=6, not collision time for freeway 6 (which is t_rel=5,6)\n\n- t_rel=5, y=7, safe\n\n- t_rel=6, y=8, not collision time (t_rel=13-16)\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is freeway 8 safe at t_rel=6? Yes, collision only later.\n\nAnd we reached in 7 turns.\n\nBut earlier I thought freeway 6 has collision at t_rel=5 and 6, but in this path, we are on freeway 6 only at t_rel=4, which is safe, and at t_rel=5 and 6, we are on y=7 and 8, not on freeway 6.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo minimal H is 7, with all U actions.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6: collision at t_rel=5 and 6.\n\nIn the path, at t_rel=4, we are on y=6, which is freeway 6, at time t_rel=4: no collision.\n\nThen we move up, so at t_rel=5, we are on y=7, not y=6.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 and 3 collision at t_rel=3, but at t_rel=3, we are on y=5, not y=2 or 3.\n\ny=5 is freeway 5, always safe.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut is there a reason to take longer? Probably not, since we can go directly.\n\nBut let me see if we need to avoid something.\n\nPerhaps at the start, if we stay or something, but no need.\n\nAnother thing: the player position at turn t_1 is given, and we take action starting from turn t_1.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nWith H=7, actions all U.\n\nBut let me write the sequence.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +6: U\n\nBut t_1 +6 is the last action.\n\nNow, positions: at turn t_1: y=2\n\nAfter U, at turn t_1+1: y=3\n\n...\n\nAt turn t_1+6: y=8 (after action at t_1+5? Let's list:\n\nTurn | action | position at this turn\n\nTurn t_1: position y=2, then action a_{t_1}, say U, so position at turn t_1+1 will be 3.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t_1+1: position y=3, action U, position at t_1+2:4\n\n...\n\nAt turn t_1+6: position y=8, action U, position at t_1+7:9\n\nAnd at turn t_1+7, position is 9, which is the goal.\n\nFor collision, we need position at turn t_1 to t_1+6 to be safe, which they are.\n\nAt turn t_1+7, we are at y=9, no issue.\n\nSo H=7.\n\nBut is there a problem with freeway 8 later? But we are not there at collision times.\n\nIn this case, we reached before freeway 8 collision times.\n\nt_rel=6 for y=8, which is turn 72+6=78, and freeway 8 collision starts at t_rel=13, which is turn 85, later.\n\nSo fine.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if we can reach faster? From y=2 to y=9, minimum 7 steps, since each step changes y by at most 1. So 7 is minimal possible.\n\nAnd we achieved it, so it should be the answer.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car list, freeway 7 has cars, but they don't cover x=0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother thing: the note about moving to different y.\n\nIt says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but not Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut in this case, it doesn't affect us, because we are only concerned with the current freeway at the current turn.\n\nIn our path, no issue.\n\nFor example, at turn T, we are on y_T, and we might move to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, we are only on y_T, so we only care about cars on y_T at time T.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T+1, we are on y_{T+1}, care about cars on y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is all U for 7 actions.\n\nBut let me write the actions.\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: U\n\nTurn t_1 +2: U\n\nTurn t_1 +3: U\n\nTurn t_1 +4: U\n\nTurn t_1 +5: U\n\nTurn t_1 +6: U\n\nAfter that, at turn t_1+7, position is 9.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have 7 actions, from t_1 to t_1+6.\n\nH=7.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,2), and we need to reach (0,9), which we do.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if at any point we are at collision.\n\nFor example, at t_rel=4, y=6, freeway 6 at time t_rel=4.\n\nCar on freeway 6: at t_rel=4, span: [-41 +6*4, -30 +6*4] = [-41+24, -30+24] = [-17, -6], which is negative, so x=0 not covered, since all negative, so no collision.\n\nAt t_rel=5, we are not on freeway 6, we are on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nFreeway 2 at t_rel=0: [ -47 +0, -36 +0] = [-47,-36], not covering 0.\n\nAt t_rel=3, it covers, but we are not on it.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 7 turns.\n\nBut in the output, we need to list the actions.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 2 and 3, they have two cars, but only one causes collision, but we handled.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 72\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Collision Analysis\nThe collision times for each freeway relative to \\(t_1 = 72\\) (i.e., \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = T - 72\\)) are:\n- **Freeway 1**: No collision at any \\(t_{\\text{rel}}\\) (cars never cover x=0).\n- **Freeway 2**: Collision only at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 3\\) (turn \\(T = 75\\)).\n- **Freeway 3**: Collision only at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 3\\) (turn \\(T = 75\\)).\n- **Freeway 4**: No collision at any \\(t_{\\text{rel}}\\).\n- **Freeway 5**: No collision at any \\(t_{\\text{rel}}\\).\n- **Freeway 6**: Collision at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 5\\) and \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 6\\) (turns \\(T = 77\\) and \\(T = 78\\)).\n- **Freeway 7**: No collision at any \\(t_{\\text{rel}}\\) (cars never cover x=0).\n- **Freeway 8**: Collision at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 13, 14, 15, 16\\) (turns \\(T = 85\\) to \\(T = 88\\)).\n\n### Minimal Path to Reach (0, 9)\nThe minimal number of turns to move from y=2 to y=9 is 7, as each action changes y by at most ±1. A sequence of \"U\" (up) actions for 7 turns achieves this:\n- Start at turn \\(t_1 = 72\\), y=2.\n- After each \"U\" action, y increases by 1:\n  - Turn 72: y=2 → 3\n  - Turn 73: y=3 → 4\n  - Turn 74: y=4 → 5\n  - Turn 75: y=5 → 6\n  - Turn 76: y=6 → 7\n  - Turn 77: y=7 → 8\n  - Turn 78: y=8 → 9\n- At turn 79 (after the 7th action), y=9.\n\n### Collision Avoidance\n- At turn 72 (\\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 0\\)): y=2 (freeway 2) – safe (collision only at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 3\\)).\n- At turn 73 (\\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 1\\)): y=3 (freeway 3) – safe (collision only at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 3\\)).\n- At turn 74 (\\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 2\\)): y=4 (freeway 4) – safe (no collision).\n- At turn 75 (\\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 3\\)): y=5 (freeway 5) – safe (no collision).\n- At turn 76 (\\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 4\\)): y=6 (freeway 6) – safe (collision at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 5,6\\), not 4).\n- At turn 77 (\\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 5\\)): y=7 (freeway 7) – safe (no collision; not on freeway 6).\n- At turn 78 (\\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 6\\)): y=8 (freeway 8) – safe (collision at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 13-16\\), not 6).\n\nThe path reaches y=9 in 7 turns without any collisions. Since 7 is the minimal possible turns (as |9-2| = 7), and the sequence is safe, it is optimal.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe actions for turns \\(t_1 = 72\\) to \\(t_1 + 6 = 78\\) are all \"U\" (up), resulting in position (0, 9) at turn 79.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 72: U \\\\\nTurn 73: U \\\\\nTurn 74: U \\\\\nTurn 75: U \\\\\nTurn 76: U \\\\\nTurn 77: U \\\\\nTurn 78: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 73. I have to output a sequence of actions starting from turn 73.\n\nThe player moves vertically: U for up (y increases by 1), D for down (y decreases by 1), or S for stay (y stays the same). y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars are on each freeway y=1 to 8, and they move horizontally. For each car, I have its head and tail positions at turn t_1=73, its direction, and speed. The direction tells us if it's left-moving or right-moving.\n\nCollision happens at turn T if the player is on a freeway y, and at that turn, the x-position 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway. Importantly, if I move to a new row at turn T, I'm not on that row until the next turn. So at turn T, when I decide to move, I'm still on the current row for collision purposes, and I move to the new row at turn T+1.\n\nLet me denote the turn index. At turn t, the player is at y_t. Then I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn based on y_t and the car positions at turn t.\n\nFor a car, given its state at t_1, I need to find its span at any future turn T.\n\nLet Δt = T - t_1.\n\nFor left-moving car: span at T is [h - s * Δt, τ - s * Δt]? Let's see the rule.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\n\nIn the input, for left-moving, head and tail are given. For example, on freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36). But 48 to 83, if left-moving, head should be the left end or right? I think there might be inconsistency.\n\nLet's clarify the span notation.\n\nFor a left-moving car, it says: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" and then Span(T) = [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nBut in this case, for freeway 4: h=48, τ=83, left, s=36. If it's left-moving, and span [h,τ] with h=48, τ=83, that means from 48 to 83, which is increasing, but left-moving should decrease position, so perhaps h is the head in the direction of motion.\n\nI need to interpret head and tail based on direction.\n\nFor left-moving car: head is the front, which is the left end if we think x increasing right. So for left-moving, head h should be less than tail τ? No.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nTypically, for a left-moving car, the head (front) is on the left, and tail on the right, so x_head < x_tail, and as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nIn the span, [h, τ] might be in order from left to right or something.\n\nLook at the update: for left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nIf at t_1, Span = [h, τ], then at T, it's [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt], so both decrease, meaning the car is moving left.\n\nBut for the values, on freeway 4: h=48, τ=83, so [48,83], which is from 48 to 83, so if moving left, at t_1, it's from 48 to 83, head at 48? But head should be the leading end.\n\nI think \"head\" is defined as the front of the car in its direction of motion.\n\nFor left-moving, front is smaller x, for right-moving, front is larger x.\n\nIn the span notation, for left-moving: [h, τ] with h being the head (smaller x), τ the tail (larger x), so span is from min to max? [h, τ] with h < τ for left-moving.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" it says? Let's see.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], which might be [tail, head], so for right-moving, tail is smaller, head is larger.\n\nFor example, freeway 2: (-24, -35, right, 12) but -24 and -35, -24 > -35, so if right-moving, head should be larger, so τ = -35, h = -24? But it says (head h, tail τ, direction, speed), so for this car, h = -24, τ = -35, d = right, s=12.\n\nBut for right-moving, head should be the front, which is larger x, so h = -24, τ = -35, since -24 > -35, so head at -24, tail at -35, so the car spans from τ to h, i.e., -35 to -24.\n\nIn the notation, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor right-moving, h is head (larger x), τ is tail (smaller x), so span is from τ to h.\n\nIn the update for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt], which makes sense, both increase.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, h is head (smaller x), τ is tail (larger x), span [h, τ] → [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt].\n\nFor freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36), so h=48, τ=83, d=left, s=36, so at t_1, span [48, 83], moving left.\n\nNow, collision at turn T if player is on freeway y, and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nPlayer is on y at turn T if y_T = y.\n\nAnd when moving, at turn T, after action, y_{T+1} is set, but for collision at T, it's based on y_T.\n\nAlso, the grid has y from 0 to 9, but freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision there. But player starts at y=3, which is a freeway, and needs to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no cars, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 no cars.\n\nNow, I need to find a path from y=3 to y=9 in min turns, avoiding being on a freeway row when a car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, I can compute for each freeway and each turn, whether x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nLet t_start = t_1 = 73.\n\nI need to simulate from t=73 onwards.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (h=-48, τ=-95, d=right, s=48)\n\nSince d=right, head is larger, so at t_1, span from τ to h: τ=-95, h=-48, so [-95, -48]\n\nMoving right, so at time T, span [ -95 + s Δt, -48 + s Δt ] with s=48, Δt = T - 73\n\nCollision on freeway 1 at T if 0 in [ -95 + 48 Δt, -48 + 48 Δt ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (h=-24, τ=-35, d=right, s=12) so for right-moving, span from τ to h: τ=-35, h=-24, so [-35, -24] at t_1\n\nMoving right, span at T: [ -35 + 12 Δt, -24 + 12 Δt ]\n\nSecond car: (48, 37, right, 12) h=48, τ=37? But for right-moving, h should be head larger, but 48>37, so τ=37, h=48, span [37,48] at t_1.\n\nd=right, s=12, so at T: [37 + 12 Δt, 48 + 12 Δt]\n\nBut freeway 2 has two cars, so collision if 0 in either span.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? It says: | 3 | (-24, -35, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12) | so identical to freeway 2.\n\nProbably a typo or same setup.\n\nFreeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36) h=48, τ=83, d=left, so for left-moving, span [h,τ] = [48,83] at t_1, moving left, so at T: [48 - 36 Δt, 83 - 36 Δt]\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4: (48,83,left,36)\n\nFreeway 6: only one car: (-24, -35, right, 6) so h=-24, τ=-35, d=right, s=6, span at t_1: [τ,h] = [-35,-24], at T: [-35 + 6 Δt, -24 + 6 Δt]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 4) and (16,5, right,4)\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4) h=-48, τ=-59?

Δt is integer, turns are discrete.\n\nT and Δt are integers, since turns are discrete.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 ≤ -48 + 48 Δt => 48 Δt ≥ 48 => Δt ≥ 1\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe when Δt ≥1 and Δt ≤1, so only at Δt=1? Let's see:\n\nFrom above: 0 ≤ -48 + 48 Δt => 48 Δt ≥ 48 => Δt ≥1\n\nAnd -95 + 48 Δt ≤ 0 => 48 Δt ≤ 95 => Δt ≤ 95/48 ≈1.979, so since Δt integer, Δt=1\n\nThen at Δt=1, check: -95 +48*1 = -47, -48+48=0, so span [-47,0] at T=73+1=74, so 0 is included? -47 to 0, so x=0 is the right end, included.\n\nSimilarly, for Δt=0: at t_1, span [-95,-48], 0 not in, so safe at t_1.\n\nFor Δt=2: -95 +96=1, -48+96=48, span [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 1 is unsafe only at turn T=74 (since Δt=1, T=73+1=74)\n\nT=73 + Δt.\n\nAt turn T, with Δt = T - 73.\n\nFor freeway 1, unsafe only at T=74.\n\nNow freeway 2:\n\nFirst car: (-35 +12 Δt, -24 +12 Δt)\n\n0 in this if -35 +12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -24 +12 Δt\n\nLeft: -35 +12 Δt ≤ 0 => 12 Δt ≤ 35 => Δt ≤ 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so Δt ≤ 2\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -24 +12 Δt => 12 Δt ≥ 24 => Δt ≥ 2\n\nSo for first car, unsafe when Δt=2?

Since 37>0 and Δt≥0, 37 +12 Δt >0 always, so never ≤0, so 0 never in this span.

From above, y=3 unsafe only at t=75, so at t=73, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nSince I can move up, down, or stay, but to minimize turns, I should move up as much as possible, but avoid unsafe positions.\n\nThe distance is 6 steps up (from 3 to 9), but I might need to wait or detour if unsafe.\n\nBut y=9 is safe, and no cars.\n\nNow, let's list the safe times for each row, or rather, for each row, when it is safe to be there.\n\nBut since the unsafe times are specific, I can think of the path turn by turn.\n\nStart at t=73, y=3.\n\nI need to choose actions for each turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn and the y position after action, but collision depends on y at the start of turn.\n\nAt turn t, player is at y_t, then I choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1}, but for collision at turn t, it's based on y_t and cars at t.\n\nThen at t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nAt turn t=73, y=3, and it is safe, as above.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns to increase y from 3 to 9 is 6, if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nFirst, let's see the unsafe events:\n\n- At t=74, y=1 is unsafe\n\n- At t=75, y=2,3,4,5 are unsafe\n\n- At t=77,78 y=6 unsafe\n\n- At t=85-88 y=7 and y=8 unsafe, but those are far, so for min turns, I might not reach there, since from t=73, to go to y=9, min 6 turns, so by t=78 or earlier, I should be at y=9 if possible.\n\nt=73: y=3\n\nIf I go up each turn:\n\nt=73: at y=3, safe, choose U, so y_{74} = 4\n\nAt t=74: y=4, now is y=4 safe at t=74? From above, y=4 unsafe only at t=75, so at t=74, y=4 should be safe? Let's confirm.\n\nFor y=4, freeway 4, unsafe only at t=75, as above.\n\nSimilarly, at t=74, no unsafe for y=4.\n\nBut at t=74, y=1 is unsafe, but I'm on y=4, so ok.\n\nSo at t=74, y=4, safe, choose U, y_{75} =5\n\nNow at t=75: y=5, but y=5 unsafe at t=75! Collision.\n\nBecause y=5 is unsafe at t=75.\n\nSimilarly, if I were on y=2,3,4 at t=75, all unsafe.\n\nSo at t=75, I cannot be on y=2,3,4,5.\n\nBut in this path, at t=75, I am at y=5, which is unsafe.\n\nSo collision.\n\nTherefore, I need to avoid being on rows 2-5 at turn 75.\n\nNow, at t=74, I was at y=4, but instead of going up to y=5, I could stay or go down.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, I could go to y=0 or y=9 to wait.\n\nBut y=0 is below, not helpful.\n\nAt t=73, I am at y=3.\n\nOptions:\n\n- If I go up to y=4 at t=74 (since a_t at t sets y_{t+1}, so at t=73, choose a_{73}, set y_{74}.\n\nIf a_{73} = U, then y_{74} =4\n\nThen at t=74, y=4, which is safe (since unsafe only at t=75 for y=4), then I need to choose a_{74}.\n\nIf I go up to y=5, then at t=75, y=5, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, y=4 at t=75, unsafe.\n\nIf I go down, to y=3 at t=75, unsafe.\n\nSo all choices lead to y=2,3,4, or 5 at t=75, all unsafe.\n\nTherefore, from y=4 at t=74, I cannot avoid being unsafe at t=75 if I stay on rows 2-5.\n\nBut at t=74, I could go to a different row.\n\nAt t=74, after action, I set y_{75}, but for collision at t=74, it's based on y_{74}.\n\nAt turn t=74: I am at y_{74}, which is set by previous action.\n\nIn this case, if I chose U at t=73, y_{74}=4.\n\nThen at t=74, I am at y=4, safe.\n\nNow I choose a_{74}, which sets y_{75}.\n\ny_{75} can be 3,4, or 5 depending on action.\n\nBut at t=75, whichever I am on, if y=2,3,4,5, it is unsafe.\n\nSo I need to not be on rows 2-5 at t=75.\n\nThe only safe rows at t=75 are y=0,1,6,7,8,9.\n\ny=1: but y=1 is unsafe at t=74, but at t=75?\n\ny=1 unsafe only at t=74, as we have.\n\nAt t=75, y=1: is it safe?\n\nFor y=1, unsafe only at t=74, so at t=75, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6: unsafe at t=77,78, so at t=75 safe.\n\ny=7 safe until t=85, etc.\n\nSo at t=75, safe rows: y=0,1,6,7,8,9\n\nNow, from t=74, I am at y=4.\n\nI need to get to one of these safe rows by t=75.\n\nBut at t=74, I can choose action to set y_{75}.\n\nFrom y=4, I can go to y=3,4,5 with D,S,U.\n\nBut y=3,4,5 are all unsafe at t=75.\n\nI need to go to y=1 or y=6 or other, but from y=4, I can only move to adjacent or stay, so y=3,4,5.\n\nI cannot reach y=1 or y=6 from y=4 in one step.\n\nMaximum change is 1 per turn.\n\nSo from y=4 at t=74, I can only be at y=3,4, or 5 at t=75, all unsafe.\n\nTherefore, I must not be at y=4 at t=74 if I want to avoid t=75 collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I start at t=73 with different action.\n\nAt t=73, I am at y=3.\n\nI can choose a_{73}:\n\n- U: go to y=4 at t=74\n\n- D: go to y=2 at t=74\n\n- S: stay at y=3 at t=74\n\nNow, at t=74:\n\nIf I go to y=4 (via U at t=73), then as above, stuck, will be unsafe at t=75.\n\nIf I go to y=2 via D at t=73: so y_{74}=2\n\nAt t=74, y=2, is it safe? y=2 unsafe only at t=75, so at t=74, y=2 should be safe.\n\nThen at t=74, I am at y=2, choose a_{74} to set y_{75}.\n\nBut y_{75} can be 1,2,3.\n\ny=1: at t=75, is it safe? Yes, since unsafe only at t=74.\n\ny=2 at t=75 unsafe.\n\ny=3 at t=75 unsafe.\n\nSo I can choose to go to y=1 at t=75 by choosing D at t=74.\n\nThen at t=75, y=1, which is safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=73 I choose S, then y_{74}=3, at t=74 y=3 safe (since unsafe at t=75), then at t=74 I can choose to go to y=2,3,4, all unsafe at t=75 except if I can go to y=1 or something, but from y=3, I can go down to y=2 or up to y=4, both unsafe, or stay y=3 unsafe. Cannot reach y=1 in one step from y=3.\n\nFrom y=3, min y I can go is y=2 with D.\n\ny=1 is two steps down.\n\nBut at t=74, from y=3, I can only set y_{75} to 2,3,4.\n\nNone safe at t=75.\n\nTherefore, the only option to avoid collision at t=75 is to be at y=1 or y=6, etc., at t=75.\n\nBut to be at y=1 at t=75, I need to be at y=1 or y=2 at t=74, and choose action to y=1.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=6 at t=75, need to be at y=5,6,7 at t=74.\n\nNow, at t=73, I am at y=3.\n\nIf I choose D at t=73, then y_{74}=2.\n\nThen at t=74, y=2, I choose D, so y_{75}=1, which is safe at t=75.\n\nThen from y=1 at t=75, I can start going up.\n\nIf I choose U at t=73, y_{74}=4, then I cannot reach a safe row at t=75.\n\nSimilarly, if S, y_{74}=3, cannot.\n\nSo only by going down to y=2 then to y=1, I can be safe at t=75.\n\nI could go up to higher rows, but from y=3 at t=73, if I go U to y=4 at t=74, then I cannot go to y=6 at t=75 because y=6 is two steps up from y=4, but I can only move one per turn.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=74, I can go to y=5 at t=75, which is unsafe, or to y=4 or y=3, unsafe.\n\nCannot reach y=6.\n\nSimilarly, from y=3 at t=73, I cannot reach y=6 by t=75 in two steps: to t=74 y=4, t=75 y=5, max.\n\nSo only option is to go down to y=1 for safety at t=75.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nNow, after t=75, the next unsafe times are at t=77,78 for y=6, and later for y=7,8 but far.\n\nSince I am at y=1 at t=75, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=1 to y=9 is 8 steps, but I can move up.\n\nAt t=75, I am at y=1.\n\nNow, t=76: I can choose to go up to y=2, or stay, or down, but down to y=0 not useful.\n\nNow, y=2 at t=76: is it safe? y=2 unsafe only at t=75, so at t=76 safe.\n\nSimilarly, all rows safe except later.\n\nSo at t=75, y=1, safe, I choose U, so y_{76}=2\n\nAt t=76, y=2, safe, choose U, y_{77}=3\n\nNow at t=77, y=3, is it safe? y=3 unsafe only at t=75, so at t=77 safe.\n\nBut now, y=6 is unsafe at t=77 and t=78.\n\nI need to go to y=6 eventually.\n\nAt t=77, I am at y=3.\n\nIf I go up, to y=4 at t=78, etc.\n\nBut at t=77, y=6 is unsafe, but I am not on y=6 yet.\n\nSimilarly at t=78, y=6 unsafe.\n\nNow, when I reach y=6, I need to not be there at t=77 or 78.\n\nSimilarly, other rows are safe.\n\nSo let's continue.\n\nFrom t=77: y=3, safe, I can choose U to y=4 at t=78.\n\ny_{77}=3, choose a_{77}, set y_{78}.\n\nIf U, y_{78}=4\n\nAt t=78, y=4, safe (since unsafe only t=75), choose U, y_{79}=5\n\nAt t=79, y=5, safe, choose U, y_{80}=6\n\nNow at t=80, y=6.\n\nIs y=6 safe at t=80? y=6 unsafe at t=77 and 78, so at t=80 safe.\n\nThen I can continue up.\n\nBut at t=80, y=6, choose U to y=7 at t=81, and so on to y=9.\n\nBut let's see how many turns.\n\nStart: t=73, y=3\n\nt=73: choose D? Earlier I said to avoid t=75, I need to go to y=1 at t=75.\n\nSo:\n\nt=73: choose D, so y_{74} = 2\n\nAt t=74: y=2, choose D, so y_{75} = 1\n\nAt t=75: y=1, safe\n\nThen t=75: choose U, so y_{76} = 2\n\nt=76: y=2, choose U, y_{77} = 3\n\nt=77: y=3, choose U, y_{78} = 4\n\nt=78: y=4, choose U, y_{79} = 5\n\nt=79: y=5, choose U, y_{80} = 6\n\nt=80: y=6, safe (since unsafe at 77,78, not 80), choose U, y_{81} = 7\n\nt=81: y=7, now y=7 unsafe at t=85-87, but t=81 is early, safe, choose U, y_{82} = 8\n\nt=82: y=8, unsafe at t=85-88, but t=82 safe, choose U, y_{83} = 9\n\nNow at t=83, y=9, which is the goal, and safe.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9 at some turn, and stop.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t=83, y=9.\n\nNow, the actions: from t=73 to t=82, I think.\n\nt=73: D\n\nt=74: D\n\nt=75: U\n\nt=76: U\n\nt=77: U\n\nt=78: U\n\nt=79: U\n\nt=80: U\n\nt=81: U\n\nt=82: U\n\nThen at t=83, y=9, but I don't need to act after reaching, I think.\n\nThe sequence is actions until I reach y=9 at the end of the sequence.\n\nIn the update, after action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAt turn t, after action, y_{t+1} is the new position.\n\nI reach y=9 at t=83, meaning after action at t=82, y_{83}=9.\n\nSo the last action is at t=82.\n\nNow, H is the number of actions, from t=73 to t=73+H-1.\n\nStarted at t=73, position (0,3).\n\nAfter H actions, at time t=73+H, position should be (0,9).\n\nAfter action at time t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo at start, turn t=73, before action, y=3.\n\nAfter action a_{73}, y_{74} is set.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t}, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nI want y_{t} =9 for some t.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t=73 + H, y_{73+H} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=73 to t=73 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, at t=83, y=9, so t=73 + H =83, so H=10.\n\nActions from t=73 to t=82, 10 actions.\n\nList:\n\nTurn 73: action D, so y74=2\n\nTurn 74: action D, y75=1\n\nTurn 75: action U, y76=2\n\nTurn 76: action U, y77=3\n\nTurn 77: action U, y78=4\n\nTurn 78: action U, y79=5\n\nTurn 79: action U, y80=6\n\nTurn 80: action U, y81=7\n\nTurn 81: action U, y82=8\n\nTurn 82: action U, y83=9\n\nSo at turn 83, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, is this minimal H? H=10.\n\nBut I started from y=3, to y=9, min 6 steps, but I took a detour down to y=1, so added 2 steps down and 1 step to come back? From y=3 to y=1 is two steps down, then from y=1 to y=9 is 8 steps up, total 10 steps, same as direct if no obstacle, but here I had to avoid.\n\nIs there a shorter way?\n\nFor example, could I go up to y=6 before t=77?\n\nt=77 and 78 y=6 unsafe.\n\nAt t=73, y=3.\n\nIf I go up immediately, but at t=75 I hit unsafe.\n\nUnless I can be at y=6 at t=76 or earlier.\n\ny=6 unsafe only at t=77 and 78, so before or after is safe.\n\nAt t=73, y=3.\n\nt=73: U, y74=4\n\nt=74: U, y75=5, but y=5 unsafe at t=75, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nt=73: S, y74=3\n\nt=74: U, y75=4, unsafe.\n\nt=73: D, y74=2\n\nt=74: U, y75=3, unsafe.\n\nAll lead to unsafe at t=75 if I stay in the area.\n\nThe only safe at t=75 is y=1 or y=6+.\n\nBut y=6 at t=75: how to reach?\n\nFrom y=3 at t=73, to y=6 at t=75.\n\ny_{75} = y after actions at t=74 and t=73.\n\nAt t=73, choose a73, set y74.\n\nAt t=74, choose a74, set y75.\n\nFrom y=3, to y=6 in two steps: need to go up twice.\n\nt=73: U, y74=4\n\nt=74: U, y75=5, not 6.\n\nCannot reach y=6 in two steps from y=3; max to y=5.\n\nTo reach y=6 at t=75, I need y75=6.\n\nBut from y=3, after two actions, y75 can be at most y=5 (up, up).\n\ny=3 to y=4 to y=5.\n\nCannot reach y=6 until t=76 at earliest: t=73 U to y4, t=74 U to y5, t=75 U to y6.\n\nBut at t=75, I set y76, not y75.\n\nPosition at time t.\n\nAt turn t, before action, y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo at turn t=75, y_t = y75 is the position before action.\n\nIf I want to be at y=6 at turn t=75, that means before action at t=75.\n\nTo have y75=6.\n\nHow to set y75=6.\n\ny75 is set by action at t=74.\n\nAt t=74, I choose a74, which sets y75 based on y74.\n\nSo y75 = y74 + Δy, depending on a74.\n\nThus, to have y75=6, I need y74 such that I can reach y=6 from there.\n\ny74 could be 5,6,7.\n\nThen a74: if y74=5, U to y75=6; if y74=6, S to y75=6 or D to 5 or U to 7; etc.\n\nBut y74 is set at t=73.\n\nAt t=73, y73=3.\n\nChoose a73, set y74.\n\ny74 can be 2,3,4.\n\nThen from there, at t=74, set y75.\n\nIf y74=2, y75 can be 1,2,3\n\nIf y74=3, y75=2,3,4\n\nIf y74=4, y75=3,4,5\n\nNone can be y=6.\n\nTherefore, impossible to be at y=6 at t=75.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be at y=7 or higher at t=75 from start.\n\nThus, the only safe options at t=75 are y=0 or y=1.\n\ny=0 is possible, but farther down.\n\ny=1 is closer.\n\nSo going to y=1 at t=75 is necessary.\n\nThen from there, up.\n\nIn the path above, I have 10 turns.\n\nBut I could go faster after t=75.\n\nAt t=75, y=1.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9.\n\nBut y=6 is unsafe at t=77 and 78.\n\nSo when I reach y=6, I should avoid t=77 and 78.\n\nIn the path: t=75: y=1, U to y76=2\n\nt=76: U to y77=3\n\nt=77: y=3, U to y78=4\n\nt=78: U to y79=5\n\nt=79: U to y80=6\n\nNow at t=80, y=6, which is after t=78, so safe.\n\nBut I could reach y=6 earlier.\n\nFor example, from y=1 at t=75, I can go up faster.\n\nt=75: y=1, choose U, y76=2\n\nt=76: y=2, choose U, y77=3\n\nAt t=77, y=3, if I choose U, y78=4\n\nBut y=6 at t=77 is unsafe, but I am not there.\n\nTo reach y=6, earliest at t=77? y77=6.\n\nBut y77 is set at t=76.\n\nAt t=76, y76= position.\n\nFrom above, at t=76, I have y76=2 if I go up from y=1.\n\nThen at t=76, y=2, choose a76, set y77.\n\ny77 can be 1,2,3.\n\nNot 6.\n\nTo have y77=6, need y76=5,6, or7.\n\nBut from t=75 y=1, at t=76 y can be 2 max, so impossible.\n\nSimilarly, y77 can be at most 3 if I go up twice from y=1.\n\nt=75: U to y76=2\n\nt=76: U to y77=3\n\nThen t=77: U to y78=4\n\nt=78: U to y79=5\n\nt=79: U to y80=6\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf at t=77 I go up, but still slow.\n\nNo way to reach y=6 before t=80 from y=1 at t=75.\n\nt=75: y=1\n\nAfter one action, t=76: y=2\n\nAfter two actions, t=77: y=3\n\nAfter three, t=78: y=4\n\nAfter four, t=79: y=5\n\nAfter five, t=80: y=6\n\nThen to y=9: after five more actions? y=6 to y=7 at t=81, y=8 at t=82, y=9 at t=83, same as before.\n\nt=80: y=6, U to y81=7\n\nt=81: y=7, U to y82=8\n\nt=82: y=8, U to y83=9\n\nYes.\n\nBut at t=77 and t=78, I am on y=3 and y=4, which are safe, since unsafe only at t=75.\n\nNow, y=6 unsafe at t=77 and 78, but I am not there.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, could I avoid going down to y=1?\n\nFor example, go up to y=5 or something, but at t=75, y=5 is unsafe, so I must not be there.\n\nPerhaps stay at y=0 or y=9, but y=0 is below.\n\nAnother idea: at t=74, if I can be at y=6, but impossible from y=3.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think 10 turns is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision points again.\n\nIn this path, I never collide.\n\nStart: t=73, y=3, safe.\n\nAction D: y74=2\n\nt=74, y=2, safe? y=2 unsafe at t=75, not t=74, so safe.\n\nAction D: y75=1\n\nt=75, y=1, safe? y=1 unsafe at t=74, not t=75, so safe.\n\nAction U: y76=2\n\nt=76, y=2, safe.\n\nAction U: y77=3\n\nt=77, y=3, safe (unsafe only t=75)\n\nAction U: y78=4\n\nt=78, y=4, safe\n\nAction U: y79=5\n\nt=79, y=5, safe\n\nAction U: y80=6\n\nt=80, y=6, unsafe at t=77,78, not 80, so safe.\n\nAction U: y81=7\n\nt=81, y=7, unsafe at t=85-87, not 81, safe.\n\nAction U: y82=8\n\nt=82, y=8, unsafe at t=85-88, not 82, safe.\n\nAction U: y83=9\n\nt=83, y=9, safe, goal reached.\n\nNow, actions from t=73 to t=82, that's 10 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, I need to list the actions.\n\nThe answer should be the sequence of actions for turns starting from t_1=73.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 73: D\n\nTurn 74: D\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nAnd then at turn 83, position is (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, I have 10 actions, from t=73 to t=82.\n\nThe minimal H is 10.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer?\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=0 at t=75.\n\nt=73: D, y74=2\n\nt=74: D, but y74=2, if I choose D, y75=1, same as before.\n\nIf at t=74 I choose S, y75=2, but y=2 unsafe at t=75.\n\nNot good.\n\nt=73: D, y74=2\n\nt=74: U, y75=3, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=75, if I go up faster, but I can't, as before.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 earlier by not going all the way down.\n\nBut I have to avoid t=75 on rows 2-5.\n\nAnother thought: at t=75, I can be on y=6 if possible, but impossible.\n\ny=7, etc., no.\n\nSo I think 10 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can wait at y=3 until after t=75, but at t=75, y=3 is unsafe, so I must leave before or be elsewhere.\n\nAt t=74, if I am at y=3, I can go to y=3 at t=75, unsafe.\n\nBut if I go to y=4, unsafe.\n\nOnly if I go down to y=2 at t=74, then to y=1 at t=75.\n\nNo choice.\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, about y=6 unsafe at t=77,78, but in this path, I reach y=6 at t=80, after, so fine.\n\nIf I could reach y=6 before t=77, but from y=1 at t=75, earliest y=6 at t=80, as above.\n\nt=75: y=1\n\nt=76: y=2\n\nt=77: y=3\n\nt=78: y=4\n\nt=79: y=5\n\nt=80: y=6\n\nYes.\n\nAt t=77, y=3, which is safe.\n\nNo need to avoid.\n\nSo sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nI need to output the actions.\n\nAlso, in the car states, freeway 3 is same as 2, etc., but I think I handled.\n\nSo minimal H=10.\n\nBut let's see if I can reduce by going directly after.\n\nAnother idea: from t=75 y=1, instead of going step by step, but I have to.\n\nPerhaps go to y=9 directly, but distance.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, the actions:\n\nTurn 73: D\n\nTurn 74: D\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 82, action U, to y83=9.\n\nThe player reaches (0,9) at turn 83, after 10 actions.\n\nIn the boxed answer, list each turn and action.\n\nSo for turn t_1=73 to t_1 + 9 =82, since H=10, turns from 73 to 82 inclusive.\n\nt from 73 to 82, that's 10 turns.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, write in the format.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 73\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Unsafe Times\nBased on the car states at turn 73, the freeways are unsafe (i.e., x=0 is occupied by a car) at specific turns:\n- Freeway 1 (y=1): Unsafe at turn 74.\n- Freeways 2, 3, 4, 5 (y=2,3,4,5): Unsafe at turn 75.\n- Freeway 6 (y=6): Unsafe at turns 77 and 78.\n- Freeway 7 (y=7): Unsafe at turns 85, 86, 87.\n- Freeway 8 (y=8): Unsafe at turns 85, 86, 87, 88.\n\nTo avoid collision at turn 75 (when y=2,3,4,5 are unsafe), the player must be at y=1 or y=6 or higher by turn 75. However, starting from y=3 at turn 73, it is impossible to reach y=6 or higher by turn 75 due to the movement constraints (only one unit change per turn). The only feasible safe position at turn 75 is y=1.\n\n### Optimal Path\nThe minimal path involves:\n- Moving down to y=2 at turn 74 and y=1 at turn 75 to avoid the unsafe turn 75 on y=2-5.\n- Then moving up consistently from turn 75 onwards to reach y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- Turn 73: Move down (D) to reach y=2 at turn 74.\n- Turn 74: Move down (D) to reach y=1 at turn 75.\n- Turn 75: Move up (U) to reach y=2 at turn 76.\n- Turn 76: Move up (U) to reach y=3 at turn 77.\n- Turn 77: Move up (U) to reach y=4 at turn 78.\n- Turn 78: Move up (U) to reach y=5 at turn 79.\n- Turn 79: Move up (U) to reach y=6 at turn 80.\n- Turn 80: Move up (U) to reach y=7 at turn 81.\n- Turn 81: Move up (U) to reach y=8 at turn 82.\n- Turn 82: Move up (U) to reach y=9 at turn 83.\n\nThis path takes 10 turns (H=10) and avoids all collisions:\n- At turn 74, y=2 is safe (unsafe only at turn 75).\n- At turn 75, y=1 is safe (unsafe only at turn 74).\n- From turns 76 to 79, y=2 to y=5 are safe except at turn 75, which is avoided.\n- At turn 80, y=6 is safe (unsafe at turns 77-78, but turn 80 is later).\n- At turns 81 and 82, y=7 and y=8 are safe (unsafe turns 85-88 are later).\n\nNo shorter path is possible, as avoiding turn 75 requires moving to y=1, adding 2 turns compared to a direct upward path, and the upward movement from y=1 to y=9 requires 8 turns, totaling 10.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1\\) (i.e., turns 73 to 82) is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 73: D \\\\\nTurn 74: D \\\\\nTurn 75: U \\\\\nTurn 76: U \\\\\nTurn 77: U \\\\\nTurn 78: U \\\\\nTurn 79: U \\\\\nTurn 80: U \\\\\nTurn 81: U \\\\\nTurn 82: U\n}",

The cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and each freeway has one or more cars moving left or right at given speeds.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at the current turn, t=74, and how they move over time. Since the player moves in discrete turns, I need to find a sequence of actions—up (U), down (D), or stay (S)—that changes the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and I have to avoid being on a row where a car spans x=0 at that exact turn.\n\nThe collision condition is that at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn, then I collide. Also, note that when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn, so I only care about the row I'm currently on for collision.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=74. I'm at y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H should be at least the vertical distance, which is 7, since from 2 to 9 is 7 steps up. But because of the cars, I might need to stay or go down sometimes, so H could be more than 7.\n\nBut I should aim for H=7 if possible, meaning all actions U, but I have to check if that's safe.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars for each freeway at t=74.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head 0, tail -47, direction right, speed 48. Since direction is right, and head and tail are given, for right-moving cars, head is the front, so at start, span is [τ, h] = [-47, 0]? Let me read carefully.\n\nThe car state is given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIt says: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], meaning from tail to head, increasing x.\n\nIn the table, it's listed as (head, tail, ...), so for freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nSo head is 0, tail is -47, direction right.\n\nSo at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-47, 0] for a right-moving car? No.\n\nThe notation says: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving, but τ and h are given, with τ being tail, h head.\n\nIn this case, head=0, tail=-47, so since right-moving, the car is from x=-47 to x=0 at t=74.\n\nAnd it's moving right at speed 48, so each turn, it shifts right by 48 units? Speed s=48, so per turn, it moves s units in the direction.\n\nDirection right, so x increases.\n\nSimilarly for left, x decreases.\n\nNow for collision: at turn T, for a car on freeway i, if 0 is in Span(T), then if I'm on that freeway at that turn, I collide.\n\nSpan(T) is the interval covered by the car at turn T.\n\nAlso, cars are only on the freeways, and I need to be on y=1 to 8 to be at risk, but y=0 and y=9 might be safe, but I start from y=2, and need to reach y=9, which is the goal, so probably y=9 is safe, no cars there.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe, but I'm not starting from there.\n\nNow, the player position: at each turn, I'm at (0, y_t), and I choose action for next position.\n\nThe update is: at turn t, I am at y_t, I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T: if y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of some car at turn T.\n\nIf I am at y_T, and 0 is in Span(T) for that row, collision.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and after action, I move to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I am still on y_T for collision purposes.\n\nThe note says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you only care about cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, for the next turn, you care about cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nSo, for each turn, I only need to worry about the row I'm currently on at that turn.\n\nNow, since the cars move continuously, their positions change each turn.\n\nI need to compute for each freeway, for each future turn, whether there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway i and turn T, is there a car on i with 0 ∈ [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] for right-moving, or [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] for left-moving? Let's clarify the span update.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nFor left-moving car: at t1, span is [h, τ]? It says: \"left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the input, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nSince direction right, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-47, 0]\n\nAt turn T, Span(T) = [ -47 + 48(T-t1), 0 + 48(T-t1) ] = [48(T-74) -47, 48(T-74)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\n0 is in Span(T) if min(span) ≤ 0 ≤ max(span)\n\nFor right-moving, min is τ + s(T-t1), max is h + s(T-t1)\n\nSince τ < h for right-moving, I assume.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1, τ = -47, h = 0, so at T, min = -47 + 48(T-74), max = 0 + 48(T-74) = 48(T-74)\n\n0 ∈ [min, max] if min ≤ 0 ≤ max, so -47 + 48(T-74) ≤ 0 ≤ 48(T-74)\n\nSince max = 48(T-74), and min = max - 47, because the length is fixed.\n\nThe car length: from τ to h, so length |h - τ|, here |0 - (-47)| = 47 units.\n\nAt time T, the span shifts.\n\n0 ∈ [min, max] iff min ≤ 0 ≤ max.\n\nFor freeway 1, min = -47 + 48(T-74), max = 48(T-74)\n\nSo 0 ∈ [min, max] if min ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ max.\n\n0 ≤ max is always true if max >=0, but max = 48(T-74), which for T>=74, max >=0 only if T-74 >=0, which it is.\n\nT-74 >=0, so max =48(T-74) >=0.\n\nmin = -47 +48(T-74)\n\n0 ≤ max is true for T >=74.\n\nmin ≤ 0 iff -47 +48(T-74) ≤ 0 iff 48(T-74) ≤ 47 iff T-74 ≤ 47/48 <1, so for T-74 =0, min = -47 <=0, max=0, so 0 is in [min,max] since min<=0<=max.\n\nAt T=74, min=-47, max=0, so 0 is included.\n\nFor T-74=1, min = -47 +48=1, max=48, so [1,48], 0 not in, since min=1>0.\n\nSimilarly for higher T, min increases, so only at T=74, 0 is in the span for freeway 1.\n\nLet me set δ = T - t1 = T - 74\n\nFor freeway 1: right-moving, span at T: [ -47 + 48δ, 0 + 48δ ]\n\n0 ∈ [ -47 +48δ, 48δ ] iff -47 +48δ <= 0 and 0 <= 48δ\n\n0 <= 48δ is true for δ >=0\n\n-47 +48δ <=0 iff 48δ <=47 iff δ <= 47/48 <1\n\nSince δ integer, δ=0 only.\n\nSo only at T=74, 0 is occupied on freeway 1.\n\nAt T=74, for freeway 1, car is at [-47,0], so x=0 is included.\n\nNow, since I'm starting at turn 74, and I'm at y=2, not on freeway 1, so for now, at turn 74, I'm on y=2, so I need to check freeway 2.\n\nBut let's list all freeways.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars: (-12, -23, right, 12) and (60, 49, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head= -12? Tail= -23? Direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1: [τ, h] = [ -23, -12 ]? Head and tail: given as (head, tail), so for right-moving, head is larger x, tail smaller.\n\nIn (head, tail, dir, speed), head is the front, tail the rear.\n\nFor right-moving, front has higher x, so if moving right, head > tail.\n\nHere, first car: head=-12, tail=-23, so tail=-23, head=-12, so since right, at t1, span [ -23, -12 ]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (60,49,right,12), tail=49, head=60? Head=60, tail=49, so tail=49, head=60, span [49,60]\n\nDirection right.\n\nNow at turn T, for first car: span [ -23 + 12δ, -12 + 12δ ]\n\nSecond car: [49 + 12δ, 60 + 12δ ]\n\n0 in first span? min = -23 +12δ, max = -12 +12δ\n\n0 ∈ [min,max] iff min <=0 and 0<=max\n\n0<=max: -12 +12δ >=0? 12δ >=12, δ>=1\n\nmin<=0: -23 +12δ <=0, 12δ <=23, δ<=23/12=1.916, so δ<=1 since integer? δ=1 or 2?\n\nLet's:\n\n0 <= max: -12 +12δ >=0 => 12δ >=12 => δ >=1\n\nmin <=0: -23 +12δ <=0 => 12δ <=23 => δ <= 23/12 ≈1.916, so δ<=1\n\nThus δ=1 only.\n\nSimilarly, for second car: min=49+12δ, max=60+12δ, both >0 for δ>=0, so min>0, 0 not in span.\n\nSo for freeway 2, only at δ=1, first car has 0 in span? At δ=1, min= -23+12= -11, max= -12+12=0? max= -12 +12*1 =0, min= -23+12= -11\n\nSo [ -11, 0 ], so 0 is included since max=0.\n\nAt δ=1, T=75, span [ -11, 0], so x=0 is occupied.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nNow second car never near 0.\n\nSo for freeway 2, 0 is occupied only at T=75.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"3 | (-12, -23, right, 12), (60, 49, right, 12) |\"\n\nIdentical to freeway 2? Probably a copy, or same situation.\n\nFreeway 3 has same cars: (-12,-23,right,12) and (60,49,right,12), so same as freeway 2.\n\nSo for freeway 3, 0 occupied only at T=75.\n\nNow freeway 4: (12, 47, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, head=12, tail=47? For left-moving, span is given as [h, τ] at t1.\n\nFrom update: left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn input, (head, tail, dir, speed) = (12,47,left,36)\n\nSince left-moving, head is front, so for left, head has smaller x? Let's see.\n\nSpan(t1) = [h, τ], and for left, it moves left, so x decreases.\n\nAt t1, [h, τ] = [12,47], I think, but h=12, τ=47, so min=12, max=47? But direction left, so as it moves, min and max decrease.\n\nIn the span [h, τ], with h and τ, for left-moving, h is the left end? I think I have confusion.\n\nFrom the rule: left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd it says \"head at h, tail at τ\", but in the context, for left-moving, when it says head, it might be the front, which for left-moving is smaller x.\n\nIn this case, (12,47,left,36), so h=12, τ=47, and since left-moving, at t1, the car is from x=12 to x=47, I think, with head at 12, tail at 47.\n\nAs it moves left, both decrease.\n\nSpan(T) = [12 - 36δ, 47 - 36δ]\n\n0 ∈ [min, max] where min = 12 -36δ, max=47-36δ\n\n0 ∈ [min,max] iff min <=0 and 0<=max\n\n0<=max: 47-36δ >=0 => 36δ <=47 => δ <=47/36≈1.305, so δ<=1\n\nmin<=0: 12-36δ <=0 => -36δ <= -12 => 36δ >=12 => δ >=12/36=1/3≈0.333, so δ>=1 since integer.\n\nThus δ=1 only.\n\nAt δ=1, min=12-36= -24, max=47-36=11, so [-24,11], 0 in it.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as 4? \"(12, 47, left, 36)\" so identical, so only at T=75, 0 occupied.\n\nT=74 + δ, so for δ=1, T=75.\n\nNow freeway 6: (-18, -29, right, 6)\n\nOne car, right-moving, head=-18, tail=-29? Tail=-29, head=-18, span at t1: [-29, -18] for right-moving? [τ, h] = [-29, -18]\n\nSpan(T) = [-29 +6δ, -18 +6δ]\n\n0 ∈ [min,max] iff min<=0 and 0<=max\n\nmin = -29+6δ, max=-18+6δ\n\n0<=max: -18+6δ >=0 => 6δ >=18 => δ >=3\n\nmin<=0: -29+6δ <=0 => 6δ <=29 => δ <=29/6≈4.833, so δ<=4\n\nThus for δ=3,4\n\nAt δ=3, min=-29+18= -11, max=-18+18=0, so [ -11,0], 0 in\n\nAt δ=4, min=-29+24= -5, max=-18+24=6, [ -5,6], 0 in\n\nAt δ=2, min=-29+12= -17, max=-18+12= -6, both negative, 0 not <= max since max=-6<0\n\n0<=max false.\n\nSimilarly δ=5, min=-29+30=1, max=-18+30=12, min=1>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 6, 0 occupied at T=74+3=77 and T=74+4=78.\n\nδ=3 and 4, T=77 and 78.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars: (-44, -55, right, 4) and (20, 9, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: head=-44? Tail=-55, right-moving.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-55, -44]\n\nSpan(T) = [-55 +4δ, -44 +4δ]\n\n0 ∈? min<=0 and 0<=max\n\nmin=-55+4δ, max=-44+4δ\n\n0<=max: -44+4δ >=0 => 4δ >=44 => δ >=11\n\nmin<=0: -55+4δ <=0 => 4δ <=55 => δ <=55/4=13.75, so δ<=13\n\nThus for δ=11 to 13, T=74+11=85, 86, 87? δ=11,12,13\n\nBut T=85,86,87, which might be far, but we'll see.\n\nSecond car: (20,9,right,4), head=20, tail=9, span at t1: [9,20]\n\nSpan(T) = [9+4δ, 20+4δ]\n\nmin=9+4δ >0 for δ>=0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSo for freeway 7, only first car can have 0 in span, at T=85,86,87.\n\nNow freeway 8: (-33, -44, right, 3)\n\nOne car, head=-33, tail=-44, right-moving.\n\nSpan at t1: [-44, -33]\n\nSpan(T) = [-44 +3δ, -33 +3δ]\n\n0 ∈ [min,max] iff min<=0 and 0<=max\n\nmin=-44+3δ, max=-33+3δ\n\n0<=max: -33+3δ >=0 => 3δ >=33 => δ >=11\n\nmin<=0: -44+3δ <=0 => 3δ <=44 => δ <=44/3≈14.666, so δ<=14\n\nThus for δ=11 to 14, T=85 to 88.\n\nT=74+11=85, 74+12=86, 74+13=87, 74+14=88.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=2 at t=74 to y=9.\n\nThe direct way is to go up each turn, but I need to avoid rows when 0 is occupied.\n\nAt each turn, when I am on a row between 1 and 8, I must not be there if that row has a car at x=0 at that turn.\n\nSince I start at t=74, y=2.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions.\n\nFirst, let's list for each row and each turn whether it is occupied at x=0.\n\nBut turns start from 74 onwards.\n\nAlso, since I move one row per turn if I go up, but I can stay or go down.\n\nFirst, let's summarize the danger times:\n\nFor each freeway, when is 0 occupied:\n\nFreeway 1: only at T=74\n\nFreeway 2: only at T=75\n\nFreeway 3: only at T=75 (same as 2)\n\nFreeway 4: only at T=75\n\nFreeway 5: only at T=75\n\nFreeway 6: at T=77 and 78\n\nFreeway 7: at T=85,86,87\n\nFreeway 8: at T=85,86,87,88\n\nNow, for other times, those rows are safe at x=0.\n\nI am at y=2 at t=74.\n\nAt t=74, for y=2, which is freeway 2? Freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\ny=1: freeway 1, etc.\n\nSo at t=74, I am on y=2 (freeway 2).\n\nNow, at t=74, freeway 2: is 0 occupied? From above, freeway 2 has 0 occupied only at T=75, not at T=74.\n\nAt T=74, for freeway 2: let's confirm.\n\nAt δ=0, T=74, for freeway 2, first car span: min=-23 +0 = -23? Span at T: for first car, min=-23 +12*0= -23, max=-12 +0= -12, so [ -23, -12], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [49,60], not near 0.\n\nSo at T=74, freeway 2 is safe, 0 not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, at t=74, I am on y=2, which is freeway 2, and it's safe.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nI want to minimize turns, so I should go up as much as possible, but avoid dangerous spots.\n\nThe dangerous rows at specific times:\n\nFor example, freeway 2 is dangerous at t=75, meaning if I am on y=2 at t=75, I collide.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at t=75 is dangerous? Freeway 3 dangerous at t=75.\n\ny=4 at t=75 dangerous? Freeway 4 at t=75.\n\ny=5 at t=75 dangerous? Freeway 5 at t=75.\n\ny=1 is only dangerous at t=74, but I'm not on it now.\n\ny=6 dangerous at t=77 and 78.\n\ny=7 at t=85-87, etc.\n\nBut since I want to go up quickly, t=77 or 78 might be when I'm around y=6, but let's see the timeline.\n\nI start at t=74, y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9. Since y=9 is the goal, probably no cars, so safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, always safe.\n\nBut I start from y=2, need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal steps: 7 up moves, so if I go U every turn, I reach y=9 at t=74+7=81.\n\nt=74: y=2\n\nt=75: y=3 (if U)\n\nt=76: y=4\n\nt=77: y=5\n\nt=78: y=6\n\nt=79: y=7\n\nt=80: y=8\n\nt=81: y=9\n\nNow, check for each turn and position if safe.\n\nAt t=74, y=2: as above, safe, no problem.\n\nt=75, y=3: now y=3 is freeway 3, and at t=75, freeway 3 is occupied at x=0, so if I am on y=3 at t=75, I collide. Not safe.\n\nIn this path, at t=75, I go to y=3, so I am on y=3 at t=75, which is dangerous.\n\nSo I cannot do U at t=74 to go to y=3 at t=75.\n\nI need to avoid being on freeways 2,3,4,5 at t=75, since all are dangerous at t=75.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5 all have 0 occupied at t=75.\n\nFreeway 2: y=2, freeway 3: y=3, freeway 4: y=4, freeway 5: y=5.\n\nAll dangerous at t=75.\n\nAlso, freeway 1 is dangerous only at t=74, but not relevant now.\n\nSo at t=75, if I am on y=2,3,4,5, I collide.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, which is safe at t=75, since only dangerous at t=74.\n\ny=6: freeway 6, at t=75, is it dangerous? Freeway 6 dangerous at t=77 and 78, not t=75.\n\nSimilarly, y=7,8 safe at t=75.\n\nSo at t=75, only rows 2,3,4,5 are dangerous; rows 1,6,7,8 are safe.\n\nBut I am at y=2 at t=74.\n\nOptions at t=74:\n\n- Action U: go to y=3 at t=75, but y=3 dangerous at t=75, so collide.\n\n- Action D: go to y=1 at t=75\n\ny=1 at t=75: freeway 1, at t=75, not dangerous, since only dangerous at t=74. So safe.\n\n- Action S: stay at y=2 at t=75, but y=2 dangerous at t=75, collide.\n\nSo only safe action from t=74 is to go down to y=1 or... D to y=1.\n\nS would keep me at y=2, which is dangerous at t=75.\n\nU to y=3, dangerous.\n\nSo only D to y=1 is safe for t=75 position.\n\nAt t=74, if I choose D, then at t=75, I am at y=1.\n\nNow, y=1 at t=75 is safe.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, at t=75, I am at y=1.\n\nNow, actions at t=75:\n\n- U: to y=2 at t=76\n\n- D: to y=0 at t=76\n\n- S: stay at y=1 at t=76\n\nNow, at t=76, what is dangerous?\n\nFirst, freeway 1: dangerous only at t=74, so at t=76, safe.\n\nFreeway 2: dangerous only at t=75, so at t=76, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all freeways except 6,7,8 have no danger at t=76.\n\nFreeway 6 dangerous at t=77,78.\n\nFreeway 7 at 85-87, etc.\n\nSo at t=76, all rows 1-8 are safe, since no danger at t=76 except possibly others, but from above, only specific times.\n\nSpecifically, for t=76:\n\nFreeway 1: safe (danger only t=74)\n\nFreeway 2: safe (danger only t=75)\n\nFreeway 3: safe (danger only t=75)\n\nFreeway 4: safe (danger only t=75)\n\nFreeway 5: safe (danger only t=75)\n\nFreeway 6: danger at t=77,78, not t=76, so safe\n\nFreeway 7: danger at 85-87, safe\n\nFreeway 8: danger at 85-88, safe\n\nSo at t=76, any y from 1 to 8 is safe.\n\nNow back to t=75, I am at y=1.\n\nI can choose:\n\nIf U: go to y=2 at t=76, which is safe.\n\nIf S: stay y=1 at t=76, safe.\n\nIf D: to y=0 at t=76, but y=0 is not a freeway, so always safe, but I might not want to go down.\n\nSince I need to go up, probably U or S.\n\nS keeps me at y=1, but I need to go to y=9, so better to go up.\n\nSo at t=75, I should go U to y=2 at t=76.\n\nThen at t=76, y=2.\n\nNow, from t=76, y=2.\n\nI can go U to y=3 at t=77.\n\nBut at t=77, y=6 is dangerous? Freeway 6 dangerous at t=77.\n\nBut I would be at y=3 at t=77, not y=6.\n\nSo need to see where I am.\n\nTimeline:\n\nt=76: I am at y=2 (safe)\n\nAction at t=76: I can choose U, D, S.\n\nIf U: go to y=3 at t=77\n\nIf S: stay y=2 at t=77\n\nIf D: go to y=1 at t=77\n\nNow, at t=77, which rows are dangerous?\n\nFreeway 6: y=6 dangerous at t=77 (and 78)\n\nOthers: freeway 1-5 safe at t=77, since danger only earlier or later.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 safe at t=77.\n\nSo at t=77, y=6 is dangerous; other y=1-5,7,8 safe.\n\nSo if I go U at t=76, I go to y=3 at t=77, which is safe, since y=3 not dangerous at t=77.\n\nIf I stay, y=2 at t=77, safe.\n\nIf down, y=1 at t=77, safe.\n\nBut I want to go up, so U to y=3.\n\nSimilarly, at t=77, I am at y=3 (if I went U).\n\nThen action at t=77: U to y=4 at t=78.\n\nNow at t=78, dangerous rows: y=6 dangerous (freeway 6 at t=78)\n\nAlso, y=6 is dangerous at both t=77 and 78.\n\nt=78: freeway 6 dangerous.\n\nOthers safe except future.\n\ny=4 at t=78: freeway 4, which is safe, since danger only t=75.\n\nSo go U to y=4 at t=78, safe.\n\nThen at t=78, y=4.\n\nAction: U to y=5 at t=79.\n\nt=79: no dangers, freeway 6 danger only t=77,78, so safe.\n\nGo U to y=5 at t=79.\n\nt=79, y=5.\n\nU to y=6 at t=80.\n\nNow at t=80, is y=6 dangerous? Freeway 6 dangerous at t=77 and 78, not t=80. So safe.\n\nGo U to y=6 at t=80.\n\nBut at t=80, y=6 is safe? Freeway 6 at t=80: δ=80-74=6\n\nFor freeway 6, dangerous at δ=3,4, T=77,78.\n\nAt δ=6, min=-29+6*6=-29+36=7, max=-18+36=18, [7,18], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nYes.\n\nSo U to y=6 at t=80.\n\nt=80, y=6.\n\nThen U to y=7 at t=81.\n\nt=81, y=7: freeway 7, which is dangerous only at t=85-87, so safe.\n\nU to y=7.\n\nThen U to y=8 at t=82.\n\nt=82, y=8: freeway 8 dangerous at t=85-88, not now, safe.\n\nU to y=8.\n\nThen U to y=9 at t=83.\n\ny=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nNow, let's list the turns.\n\nStart: t=74, y=2\n\nBut earlier, at t=74, I had to go down to y=1 at t=75.\n\nThen:\n\nt=75: y=1 (after D from t=74)\n\nThen at t=75, I go U to y=2 at t=76\n\nt=76: y=2\n\nThen U to y=3 at t=77\n\nt=77: y=3\n\nU to y=4 at t=78\n\nt=78: y=4\n\nU to y=5 at t=79\n\nt=79: y=5\n\nU to y=6 at t=80\n\nt=80: y=6\n\nU to y=7 at t=81\n\nt=81: y=7\n\nU to y=8 at t=82\n\nt=82: y=8\n\nU to y=9 at t=83\n\nt=83: y=9, done.\n\nH=10 turns? From t=74 to t=83, that's 10 steps? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=74 to t=83.\n\nAt turn t, I choose a_t, then y_{t+1}.\n\nAt t=74, choose a_{74}, then y_{75}.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=74 to t=74 + H-1, and after H actions, I am at y=9 at turn t=74 + H.\n\nStart: turn t=74, position y=2.\n\nAfter first action a_{74}, position y_{75}\n\nAfter second action a_{75}, y_{76}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{t1 + H} = y_{74 + H}\n\nSet to 9.\n\nIn this case, from above:\n\nAt t=74: choose D, so y_{75} = 2 + (-1) = 1? y_t at turn t.\n\nAt turn t=74, y=2.\n\nChoose a_{74} = D, so Δy = -1, so y_{75} = 2 + (-1) = 1\n\nThen at t=75, y=1, choose a_{75} = U, so y_{76} = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nThen t=76, y=2, choose a_{76} = U, y_{77} = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nt=77, y=3, a_{77} = U, y_{78} = 4\n\nt=78, y=4, a_{78} = U, y_{79} = 5\n\nt=79, y=5, a_{79} = U, y_{80} = 6\n\nt=80, y=6, a_{80} = U, y_{81} = 7\n\nt=81, y=7, a_{81} = U, y_{82} = 8\n\nt=82, y=8, a_{82} = U, y_{83} = 9\n\nSo at turn t=83, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=74 to t=82, that's 9 actions: a_{74} to a_{82}, H=9 turns.\n\nt=74 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSet τ = 0 to H-1, turn t1 + τ.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nSet y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, t1=74, y_{83} =9, so 74 + H =83, so H=9.\n\nActions from τ=0 to 8.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have 9 actions.\n\nNow, but I reached in 9 turns.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nMinimal is 7, but I had to go down once, so added two turns: one down and one up later.\n\nBut perhaps I can avoid going down by staying or something.\n\nAt t=74, instead of going down, can I stay? But if I stay at t=74, S, then y_{75} = y_{74} =2, so at t=75, I am at y=2, which is dangerous, collide.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo up? To y=3 at t=75, dangerous.\n\nSo only down to y=1 is safe.\n\nBut y=1 at t=75 is safe.\n\nCould I go to y=0?\n\nAt t=74, if I go D, to y=1, as above.\n\nIf I go D twice? But that might take longer.\n\nFor example, at t=74, go D to y=1 at t=75.\n\nThen at t=75, I could go D again to y=0 at t=76.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, but then I need to go up from y=0, which takes more turns.\n\nFor example, from y=0 at t=76, go U to y=1 at t=77, etc., but that would take even longer.\n\nSo not better.\n\nAt t=75, after reaching y=1, I could stay, but staying doesn't help, I need to go up.\n\nIn the above sequence, I went up directly.\n\nBut in the sequence above, I reached at t=83 with H=9.\n\nBut let's confirm if all positions are safe.\n\nt=74: y=2, freeway 2, at t=74, safe as earlier.\n\nAction D.\n\nt=75: y=1, freeway 1, at t=75, not dangerous, safe.\n\nAction U.\n\nt=76: y=2, freeway 2, at t=76, safe (danger only t=75)\n\nAction U.\n\nt=77: y=3, freeway 3, at t=77, freeway 3 dangerous only at t=75, so safe.\n\nAction U.\n\nt=78: y=4, freeway 4, at t=78, safe (danger only t=75)\n\nAction U.\n\nt=79: y=5, freeway 5, at t=79, safe.\n\nAction U.\n\nt=80: y=6, freeway 6, at t=80, as computed, δ=6, min=7, max=18, 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U.\n\nt=81: y=7, freeway 7, at t=81, δ=7, freeway 7 dangerous at δ=11,12,13 (T=85,86,87), so at δ=7, T=81, safe.\n\nAction U.\n\nt=82: y=8, freeway 8, at t=82, δ=8, freeway 8 dangerous at δ=11 to14 (T=85-88), so at δ=8, T=82, min=-44+3*8=-44+24=-20, max=-33+24=-9, both negative, 0 not <= max, so safe.\n\nAction U.\n\nt=83: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut H=9 turns.\n\nCan I do better?\n\nFor example, at t=74, I have to go down, but perhaps I can go up later faster.\n\nAnother idea: at t=75, after I am at y=1, instead of going up immediately, I could stay or something, but no need.\n\nPerhaps I can skip some rows.\n\nBut I have to go through each row.\n\nAnother point: at t=77 and t=78, y=6 is dangerous, but in my path, at t=77 I am at y=3, t=78 at y=4, not on y=6, so fine.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nSuppose at t=74, I go down to y=1.\n\nThen at t=75, I go up to y=2 at t=76.\n\nNow, at t=76, y=2.\n\nInstead of going up to y=3 at t=77, could I go up faster? No, I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nPerhaps I can be on a different row at critical times.\n\nFor example, at t=77 and 78, y=6 is dangerous, so I should not be on y=6 then.\n\nIn my path, I am not.\n\nBut I reach y=6 at t=80, which is safe.\n\nCould I reach y=9 earlier?\n\nMinimal turns: since I had to go down to y=1 first, that added one extra step down, and since I need to net +7, total moves at least 8, but with the down and up, I have 9 actions.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9, net +7, so minimal actions 7 if no detour.\n\nBut I had to detour down to avoid the danger at t=75.\n\nI could stay on a safe row.\n\nBut at t=75, the only safe rows below are y=1, and above y=6,7,8 but I can't reach them directly.\n\nAt t=74, I am at y=2.\n\nIf I could go to y=6 directly, but I can't, only +1 per turn.\n\nSo I have to pass through intermediate rows.\n\nAt t=75, I must be on a row not 2,3,4,5.\n\nAvailable: y=1 (if I go down), or y=6,7,8 but I can't reach from y=2 in one step.\n\ny=6 is 4 steps up, impossible in one turn.\n\nSo only possibility is to go down to y=1.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up.\n\nIn the up path, I could go faster, but I can only go one per turn.\n\nUnless I skip some rows by going up every turn.\n\nIn my sequence, from t=76 to t=82, I go up every turn: y=2 to3 to4 to5 to6 to7 to8 to9, that's 7 steps from y=2 to y=9, but I started from y=2 at t=76, reached y=9 at t=83.\n\nBut at t=74, I was at y=2, but I had to go down to y=1 first at t=75, then back to y=2 at t=76, so I wasted two turns to be at same y but later.\n\nt=74 y=2, t=75 y=1, t=76 y=2, so from t=74 to t=76, I am still at y=2, but two turns passed.\n\nThen from t=76 y=2 to t=83 y=9, 7 turns, total 9 turns from start.\n\nBut since I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 earlier by not going down, but I can't because of the danger at t=75.\n\nAnother idea: at t=74, go S or U, but both lead to danger at t=75 on y=2 or y=3.\n\nUnless I can be on a row that is safe at t=75.\n\ny=1 is safe, y=6,7,8 are safe, but y=6 is far.\n\nFor example, if I go up multiple times, but from t=74 to t=75, I can only change y by 1.\n\nSo from y=2, at t=75, I can be at y=1,2,3.\n\ny=2 and y=3 are dangerous, y=1 safe.\n\nNo other choice.\n\nSo I think H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach by t=82 or something.\n\nSuppose at t=74, I go D to y=1 at t=75.\n\nThen at t=75, instead of going up immediately, I stay at y=1 for some turns? But that would delay, not helpful.\n\nGo up to y=2 at t=76, as before.\n\nThen, from y=2 at t=76, I could go up faster, but can't.\n\nNotice that at t=77 and t=78, y=6 is dangerous, but since I am below, I can proceed up.\n\nIn my sequence, I am at y=3 at t=77, y=4 at t=78, both safe.\n\nCould I be at y=5 or something earlier? No.\n\nAnother thought: at t=76, y=2, I could go U to y=3 at t=77.\n\nThen at t=77, y=3, I go U to y=4 at t=78.\n\nSame as before.\n\nI could go directly to avoid y=6 at dangerous times, but in this case, since I reach y=6 at t=80, which is safe, no issue.\n\nThe later dangers on y=7 and 8 are at t=85+, which is after I pass, so no problem.\n\nSo I think 9 turns is fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the answer format.\n\nThe sequence should be actions starting from turn t=74.\n\nIn the sequence: from t=74 to t=82, actions a_{74} to a_{82}.\n\nH=9 actions.\n\nList:\n\nTurn t_74: D\n\nThen turn t_75: U\n\nt_76: U\n\nt_77: U\n\nt_78: U\n\nt_79: U\n\nt_80: U\n\nt_81: U\n\nt_82: U\n\nAfter a_{82}, at t=83, y=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, it should be for t from t1 to t1 + H-1.\n\nHere t1=74, H=9, so t=74 to 82.\n\nActions: a_{74} = D, a_{75} = U, a_{76} = U, a_{77} = U, a_{78} = U, a_{79} = U, a_{80} = U, a_{81} = U, a_{82} = U.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=75 I have U, which is from y=1 to y=2, etc.\n\nPerhaps I can write the actions.\n\nBut in the output, it should be in the box.\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence?\n\nSuppose at t=74, I go D to y=1.\n\nThen at t=75, I go U to y=2 at t=76.\n\nNow, at t=76, I am at y=2.\n\nInstead of going up, I could go up to y=3 at t=77, same.\n\nBut at t=77, if I were at higher y, but I can't.\n\nAnother idea: after t=75, when I am at y=1, I could wait until after t=75 to go up, but since at t=76 it is safe to go up, no need to wait.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=1 at t=76, then go up later, but that would add turns, not reduce.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=0, but same issue.\n\nSo I think 9 is minimal.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway 6: dangerous at t=77 and 78.\n\nIn my path, I am at y=3 and y=4 then, not affected.\n\nAnd I pass y=6 at t=80, safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 faster by being on a row that allows skipping, but no.\n\nSuppose at t=74, I go down to y=1.\n\nThen at t=75, I go up to y=2 at t=76.\n\nNow, from t=76, y=2, I need to go to y=9, which is 7 up, so at least 7 turns, to reach at t=83, same as before.\n\nSince I have to start from y=2 at t=76 after the detour.\n\nt=76 y=2 to t=83 y=9, 7 actions, but with the initial down and up, total 9 actions.\n\nIf I could be at y=3 or something at t=76, but I can't because of the danger.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, about the later dangers: freeway 7 dangerous at t=85,86,87, which is after t=83, so I passed before.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8 at t=85-88, after.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn t_74: D\n\nTurn t_75: U\n\nTurn t_76: U\n\nTurn t_77: U\n\nTurn t_78: U\n\nTurn t_79: U\n\nTurn t_80: U\n\nTurn t_81: U\n\nTurn t_82: U\n\nIn the action, after a_{82}, at t=83, y=9.\n\nBut H=9.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 74 to 82, that's 9 turns.\n\nBut let me write in the format.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn t_{74}: D \\\\ Turn t_{75}: U \\\\ Turn t_{76}: U \\\\ Turn t_{77}: U \\\\ Turn t_{78}: U \\\\ Turn t_{79}: U \\\\ Turn t_{80}: U \\\\ Turn t_{81}: U \\\\ Turn t_{82}: U }\n\nIn the sequence, I have actions from t=74 to t=82, which is correct.\n\nBut in the initial, I have only one down and then all up except the first down.\n\nIn the sequence above, after first down, all up.\n\nBut at t=75 I have U, which is correct.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid the down by going to a safe row differently, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother thought: at t=74, I could go up if I could be on a safe row, but no.\n\nOr, since y=0 is safe, but going down is necessary.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at y=2 for multiple turns, but at t=75 it is dangerous, so I have to leave.\n\nUnless I go down at t=74 to y=1.\n\nI think it's the only way.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nBut let me confirm the car states again to make sure.\n\nFreeway 1: at t=74, occupied, but I wasn't on it.\n\nFreeway 2: at t=75 occupied, I avoided by not being there.\n\nIn the sequence, I was on y=2 at t=74 and t=76, both safe times.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nI think it's correct.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 74\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars, the sequence of actions must account for the car positions and their movements. The key danger is at turn \\(t = 75\\) (relative turn \\(\\delta = 1\\)), where freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\) are occupied at \\(x = 0\\), making these rows unsafe at that turn. Therefore, the player must not be on rows 2, 3, 4, or 5 at turn 75.\n\nStarting at turn 74 on \\(y = 2\\), which is safe at this turn, the only safe action is to move down to \\(y = 1\\) to avoid the danger at turn 75. From there, the player can ascend directly to \\(y = 9\\) without encountering any other collisions, as the dangerous times for other rows (e.g., \\(y = 6\\) at turns 77 and 78) are avoided by being on lower rows at those times, and later dangers (e.g., \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) at turns 85–88) occur after the player has passed.\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 9, with the sequence of actions from turn 74 to turn 82 leading to position (0, 9) at turn 83.\n\n**Action Sequence:**\n- Turn 74: Move down (D) to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 75.\n- Turn 75: Move up (U) to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 76.\n- Turns 76–82: Move up (U) each turn to reach \\(y = 3\\) at turn 77, \\(y = 4\\) at turn 78, \\(y = 5\\) at turn 79, \\(y = 6\\) at turn 80, \\(y = 7\\) at turn 81, \\(y = 8\\) at turn 82, and finally \\(y = 9\\) at turn 83.\n\nAll positions during the sequence are safe:\n- Turn 74, \\(y = 2\\): Freeway 2 safe at \\(\\delta = 0\\).\n- Turn 75, \\(y = 1\\): Freeway 1 safe at \\(\\delta = 1\\) (danger only at \\(\\delta = 0\\)).\n- Turn 76, \\(y = 2\\): Freeway 2 safe at \\(\\delta = 2\\) (danger only at \\(\\delta = 1\\)).\n- Turn 77, \\(y = 3\\): Freeway 3 safe at \\(\\delta = 3\\) (danger only at \\(\\delta = 1\\)).\n- Turn 78, \\(y = 4\\): Freeway 4 safe at \\(\\delta = 4\\) (danger only at \\(\\delta = 1\\)).\n- Turn 79, \\(y = 5\\): Freeway 5 safe at \\(\\delta = 5\\) (danger only at \\(\\delta = 1\\)).\n- Turn 80, \\(y = 6\\): Freeway 6 safe at \\(\\delta = 6\\) (danger at \\(\\delta = 3,4\\), not \\(\\delta = 6\\)).\n- Turn 81, \\(y = 7\\): Freeway 7 safe at \\(\\delta = 7\\) (danger at \\(\\delta = 11,12,13\\)).\n- Turn 82, \\(y = 8\\): Freeway 8 safe at \\(\\delta = 8\\) (danger at \\(\\delta = 11,12,13,14\\)).\n- Turn 83, \\(y = 9\\): Not a freeway, always safe.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 9\\) turns, which is minimal due to the necessary detour to avoid the danger at turn 75.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } t_{74}: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_{75}: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_{76}: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_{77}: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_{78}: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_{79}: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_{80}: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_{81}: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_{82}: \\text{U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 1) on turn t_1 = 75. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player moves vertically: U for up (y+1), D for down (y-1), S for stay (y same). y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at turn T. The span is the position on the x-axis where the car is; since the player is at x=0, we care about when a car's span includes x=0.\n\nThe car spans move over time based on their speed and direction. Left-moving cars decrease their position, right-moving increase.\n\nImportantly, when you move to a new y, you are not on that freeway until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you are still on y, and at turn T+1 you are on y+1. So you only check for collision on the freeway you are currently on at that turn.\n\nThe current state is given for turn t_1=75. I need to find a sequence of actions starting from turn t_1 to reach y=9 as quickly as possible, avoiding collisions.\n\nList all the cars per freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: (head=48, tail=1, direction=right, speed=48)\n\nDirection right means it's moving right, so position increases. Head is 48, tail is 1, so since it's right-moving, head > tail? The notation says for right-moving: span is [τ, h] with τ < h? Let me check the car update rules.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → moves to [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → moves to [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSo for right-moving, τ is the left end, h is the right end, so τ < h.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, h is left end, τ is right end? No:\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and it moves left, so h and τ decrease.\n\nBut in the span, for left-moving, it says [h, τ], and h to τ, but if it's moving left, h should be the front? I think it's a bit inconsistent.\n\nLook: \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nSince it's moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], so τ is the left end, h is the right end.\n\nIn the state, for freeway 1: (48, 1, right, 48)\n\nSo since direction right, τ=1, h=48? The notation in the table is \"head h, tail τ\", but in the update, for right-moving, it's [τ, h] with τ left, h right.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for update:\n\nIf d=right, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, moving right.\n\nIf d=left, span is [h, τ] with h and τ, but which is which? For left-moving, it says [h, τ] and moves to [h - s dt, τ - s dt], so if it's moving left, h must be the left end? But typically head is front.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in the definition.\n\nFor freeway 1: head=48, tail=1, direction=right, speed=48.\n\nSince direction right, and head=48, tail=1, probably head is the front, so for right-moving, front is at higher x, so τ should be tail (left end), h head (right end).\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head might be left end.\n\nBut in the update rule, for left-moving, it's [h, τ] with both decreasing, so if head h is the front when moving left, front would be at smaller x? I'm confused.\n\nPerhaps I should not worry about head and tail, just use the span.\n\nFor collision, we only care if 0 is in the span at time T.\n\nSo for a car, at time t1, we have the span endpoints, and we can compute for any T the span at time T.\n\nThen for each freeway, at each time, we can see if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span.\n\nThe player is on a freeway y at time T, and collision if for that y, at time T, some car has 0 in span.\n\nNow, back to the cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars with their positions at t1=75.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head=48, tail=1, dir=right, speed=48\n\nSince dir=right, span at t1: [τ, h] = [1, 48]  (left to right)\n\nAs time increases, position increases: span at T = [1 + 48*(T-75), 48 + 48*(T-75)]\n\nNow, freeway 2: two cars: (0, -11, right, 12) and (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nBoth right-moving.\n\nFirst car: head=0, tail=-11, dir=right, speed=12\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [-11 + 12*(T-75), 0 + 12*(T-75)]\n\nSecond car: head=-48, tail=-59, dir=right, speed=12\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T: [-59 + 12*(T-75), -48 + 12*(T-75)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? \" (0, -11, right, 12), (-48, -59, right, 12) \" yes, identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, span is [h, τ] with h and τ decreasing.\n\nHead=-24, tail=11, dir=left, speed=36.\n\nSince left-moving, span at t1: [h, τ] = [-24, 11]? But -24 to 11, and moving left, so the car is from x=-24 to x=11? But if moving left, the head should be the front, which might be at min x or max x?\n\nIn the update: for left-moving, span [h, τ] moves to [h - s dt, τ - s dt]\n\nSo at t1, positions from h to τ, and both decrease with time.\n\nIn this case, h=-24, τ=11, so from -24 to 11, and since moving left, at later times, both decrease.\n\nBut -24 < 11, so left end is -24, right end is 11, moving left, so left end decreases, right end decreases, so the car is moving leftward.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as 4, (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nFreeway 6: (-12, -23, right, 6)\n\nDir right, so span [τ, h] = [-23, -12]? head=-12, tail=-23, dir=right, so τ=tail=-23, h=head=-12, so span [-23, -12] at t1.\n\nAt T: [-23 + 6*(T-75), -12 + 6*(T-75)]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-40, -51, right, 4) and (24, 13, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: head=-40, tail=-51, dir=right, speed=4 → span [τ, h] = [-51, -40]\n\nAt T: [-51 + 4*(T-75), -40 + 4*(T-75)]\n\nSecond car: head=24, tail=13, dir=right, speed=4 → span [τ, h] = [13, 24]\n\nAt T: [13 + 4*(T-75), 24 + 4*(T-75)]\n\nFreeway 8: (-30, -41, right, 3)\n\nHead=-30, tail=-41, dir=right, speed=3 → span [τ, h] = [-41, -30]\n\nAt T: [-41 + 3*(T-75), -30 + 3*(T-75)]\n\nNow, the player starts at y=1 on turn 75.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nSince y=0 to 9, and freeways 1-8, y=1 to 8 are freeways with cars, y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, no cars mentioned.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\nThe player can move up, down, or stay.\n\nTo minimize turns, we probably want to go up as much as possible, but need to avoid collisions on the way.\n\nSince we start at y=1, and need to reach y=9, that's 8 steps up, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nEach U action increases y by 1, D decreases by 1, S stays.\n\nFrom y=1 to y=9, minimum 8 moves if we only go up, but we might have to wait or detour.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from turn t1 to t1+H-1, actions taken at each turn.\n\nDefine time relative to t1.\n\nSet τ = T - t1, so at τ=0, turn t1, position y=1.\n\nWe need to find when y=9 first, with minimal τ.\n\ny_{t1 + τ} = 9 for some τ, and we take actions from τ=0 to τ=H-1, and at τ=H-1, y=9.\n\nAt turn t1 + τ, position is y_τ.\n\nCollision if at time τ, y_τ = k for some k=1 to 8, and for freeway k, there is a car with 0 in its span at time t1 + τ.\n\nTime absolute: turn T = t1 + τ.\n\nFor freeway k, at time T, if 0 is in some car's span on that freeway, then it's occupied, collision if player is there.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we need to find when 0 is occupied, i.e., when there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nThen for each time τ, we can know for each y if it's safe or not, but since player is moving, we care about the path.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nThat is, when some car has 0 in its span at time T.\n\nT = t1 + τ = 75 + τ.\n\nFor freeway 1:\n\nCars: one car, span at T: [1 + 48*(T-75), 48 + 48*(T-75)] = [1 + 48τ, 48 + 48τ] for τ >=0\n\n0 in span if 1 + 48τ <= 0 <= 48 + 48τ\n\nBut since τ >=0, 1+48τ >=1 >0? 1+48τ >=1 >0, so 0 < left end, so 0 never in [1+48τ, 48+48τ] since left end at least 1.\n\n1+48τ >=1 for τ>=0, so left end >=1 >0, so 0 is always left of the span, never inside. So freeway 1 is never occupied at x=0? But let's see.\n\nAt τ=0, span [1,48], 0 not in [1,48], since 0<1.\n\nAs τ increases, span moves right, left end increases, so always left end >=1 >0, so 0 never in span. So freeway 1 is always safe at x=0? Is that possible?\n\nBut there might be other cars, but freeway 1 has only one car.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 1: no car has 0 in span at any time, since the car is always to the right of 0.\n\nSo freeway 1 is always safe.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (0, -11, right, 12) → at T, span [-11 + 12(T-75), 0 + 12(T-75)] = [-11 +12τ, 12τ] for τ>=0\n\n0 in span if -11 +12τ <= 0 <= 12τ\n\nWhich is 0 <= 12τ and -11+12τ <=0, so 12τ >=0 always for τ>=0, and -11+12τ <=0 implies 12τ <=11, τ <= 11/12\n\nAlso 0 <=12τ implies τ >=0.\n\nSo for τ in [0, 11/12], 0 in span? But τ is integer? Time is in turns, so τ integer.\n\nTurns are discrete, so τ integer >=0.\n\nτ <= 11/12 ≈0.916, so τ=0 only? τ=0: -11 +12*0 = -11 <=0 <=0? 0 <= 12*0=0, yes 0<=0, and -11<=0, so yes at τ=0, 0 is in [-11,0].\n\nAt τ=0, T=75, span [-11,0], so 0 is the right end, included, so yes occupied.\n\nAt τ=1, span [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12].\n\nSimilarly for τ>0, left end >=1>0.\n\nSo first car occupies freeway 2 at τ=0 only.\n\nNow second car on freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 12) → span at T: [-59 +12τ, -48 +12τ]\n\n0 in span if -59+12τ <=0 <= -48+12τ\n\nLeft: -59+12τ <=0 ⇒ 12τ <=59 ⇒ τ <=59/12≈4.916\n\nRight: 0 <= -48+12τ ⇒ 12τ >=48 ⇒ τ >=4\n\nSo for τ from 4 to 4.916, so τ=4 and τ=5? τ integer.\n\nAt τ=4: -59+48 = -11 <=0? -11<=0 true, and 0 <= -48+48=0, 0<=0 true, so yes.\n\nAt τ=5: -59+60=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, and 0 <= -48+60=12, true but left condition false.\n\n0 <= -48+12τ only if -48+12τ >=0.\n\nAt τ=4: -48+48=0 >=0, so 0<=0 true.\n\nAt τ=5: -48+60=12>0, so 0<=12 true, but left: -59+60=1 >0? -59+12*5= -59+60=1, so 1 <=0? False, so 0 not <=1? Span is [left, right], 0 in if left <=0<=right.\n\nAt τ=4: left=-59+48= -11 <=0, right= -48+48=0 <=0? 0<=0 true, so -11 <=0<=0, yes.\n\nAt τ=5: left= -59+60=1, right= -48+60=12, 1 <=0<=12? 1<=0 false, so no.\n\nAt τ=3: left= -59+36= -23, right= -48+36= -12, -23<=0<= -12? 0<= -12 false, so no.\n\nSo only at τ=4, for this car.\n\nτ=4 only.\n\nNow for freeway 2, at time τ, occupied if either car has 0 in span.\n\nAt τ=0: first car has it, so occupied.\n\nAt τ=4: second car has it, so occupied.\n\nOther times, no.\n\nτ=0 and τ=4.\n\nBut τ=0 is the current time, turn t1.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2, since identical cars, so occupied at τ=0 and τ=4.\n\nFreeway 4: cars: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so span at t1: [h, τ] = [-24, 11], and at T: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [-24 -36τ, 11 -36τ]\n\n0 in span if -24 -36τ <= 0 <= 11 -36τ\n\nNow, left inequality: -24 -36τ <=0 always true since τ>=0, -24-36τ <= -24 <0.\n\nRight inequality: 0 <= 11 -36τ ⇒ 36τ <=11 ⇒ τ <= 11/36 ≈0.305\n\nAlso, since left inequality always true for τ>=0.\n\nSo 0 <= 11-36τ only when τ <= 11/36, so for τ=0 only? τ integer.\n\nτ=0: 0 <=11-0=11 true.\n\nτ=1: 0 <=11-36= -25 false.\n\nSo only at τ=0, occupied.\n\nFreeway 5 same as freeway 4, occupied only at τ=0.\n\nFreeway 6: (-12, -23, right, 6)\n\nDir right, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-23, -12]? head=-12, tail=-23, so τ=tail=-23, h=head=-12, span [-23, -12]\n\nAt T: [-23 +6τ, -12 +6τ]\n\n0 in span if -23+6τ <=0 <= -12+6τ\n\nLeft: -23+6τ <=0 ⇒ 6τ <=23 ⇒ τ <=23/6≈3.833\n\nRight: 0 <= -12+6τ ⇒ 6τ >=12 ⇒ τ >=2\n\nSo for τ from 2 to 3.833, so τ=2,3.\n\nAt τ=2: left=-23+12= -11 <=0, right=-12+12=0 <=0? 0<=0 true, so -11<=0<=0 yes.\n\nAt τ=3: left=-23+18= -5 <=0, right=-12+18=6, 0<=6 true, so -5<=0<=6 yes.\n\nAt τ=4: left=-23+24=1 >0, not <=0, so no.\n\nSo occupied at τ=2 and τ=3.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-40, -51, right, 4) → span [τ, h] = [-51, -40] at t1, at T: [-51+4τ, -40+4τ]\n\n0 in span if -51+4τ <=0 <= -40+4τ\n\nLeft: -51+4τ <=0 ⇒ 4τ <=51 ⇒ τ <=51/4=12.75\n\nRight: 0 <= -40+4τ ⇒ 4τ >=40 ⇒ τ >=10\n\nSo τ from 10 to 12.75, so τ=10,11,12.\n\nAt τ=10: left=-51+40= -11 <=0, right=-40+40=0 <=0? yes.\n\nAt τ=11: left=-51+44= -7 <=0, right=-40+44=4, 0<=4 yes.\n\nAt τ=12: left=-51+48= -3 <=0, right=-40+48=8, 0<=8 yes.\n\nAt τ=13: left=-51+52=1>0, no.\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (24, 13, right, 4) → head=24, tail=13, dir=right, span [τ, h] = [13,24] at t1, at T: [13+4τ, 24+4τ]\n\n0 in span if 13+4τ <=0 <=24+4τ? But 13+4τ >=13>0 for τ>=0, so left end >=13>0, so 0 < left end, never in span. So this car never at x=0.\n\nSo freeway 7 occupied only by first car at τ=10,11,12.\n\nFreeway 8: (-30, -41, right, 3) → span [τ, h] = [-41, -30] at t1, at T: [-41+3τ, -30+3τ]\n\n0 in span if -41+3τ <=0 <= -30+3τ\n\nLeft: -41+3τ <=0 ⇒ 3τ <=41 ⇒ τ <=41/3≈13.666\n\nRight: 0 <= -30+3τ ⇒ 3τ >=30 ⇒ τ >=10\n\nSo τ from 10 to 13.666, so τ=10,11,12,13.\n\nAt τ=10: left=-41+30= -11 <=0, right=-30+30=0 <=0? yes.\n\nτ=11: left=-41+33= -8 <=0, right=-30+33=3, 0<=3 yes.\n\nτ=12: left=-41+36= -5 <=0, right=-30+36=6, 0<=6 yes.\n\nτ=13: left=-41+39= -2 <=0, right=-30+39=9, 0<=9 yes.\n\nτ=14: left=-41+42=1>0, no.\n\nSo occupied τ=10 to 13.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, times τ when occupied at x=0 (collision if player there):\n\n- y=1: never occupied, always safe? Earlier we said freeway 1 always safe.\n\n- y=2: occupied at τ=0 and τ=4\n\n- y=3: same as y=2, occupied at τ=0 and τ=4\n\n- y=4: occupied at τ=0 (freeway 4)\n\n- y=5: occupied at τ=0 (freeway 5)\n\n- y=6: occupied at τ=2 and τ=3\n\n- y=7: occupied at τ=10,11,12\n\n- y=8: occupied at τ=10,11,12,13\n\ny=1 is always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=1 at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, if player is on y=1, which is safe, as we said.\n\nBut at τ=0, we are at turn t1, position (0,1), and we take action a_{t1} which determines y for τ=1.\n\nThe position at time T is after the action? Let's see the update.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we take action a_t, which sets Δy_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThe collision is checked at turn T, based on y_T.\n\nAt turn T, player is at position y_T, and we check if on that freeway, x=0 is occupied.\n\nIn terms of τ: at time τ, player is at y_τ, which is the position at turn t1 + τ.\n\ny_τ is set by previous actions.\n\nStart: at τ=0, y=1.\n\nNow, we take action a_{t1 + τ} at each step.\n\nThe action at τ determines the change for y_{τ+1}.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At τ, position y_τ\n\n- Take action a_τ (relative to t1, but absolute turn t1 + τ)\n\n- Then y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy, with Δy based on a_τ.\n\nCollision at time τ: if at that turn, y_τ is between 1 and 8, and freeway y_τ is occupied at time τ.\n\nIf y_τ=0 or 9, no collision, since no cars.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9.\n\nNow, from y=1, we need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal steps: if we go up every turn, we reach y=9 in 8 steps: from y=1 to y=9 in 8 ups.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on a freeway when it's occupied.\n\nAt τ=0, we are at y=1, which is safe.\n\nNow, for the up path: suppose we go up each turn.\n\nStart τ=0, y=1, safe.\n\nTake a=U, so y_{1} = y_0 +1 = 1+1=2? Indices.\n\nSet: at τ=0, y=1\n\nAfter action a at τ=0, y_{1} = y_0 + Δy\n\nSimilarly, after action at τ, y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy\n\nPosition y_τ at time τ.\n\nFor collision at time τ, we care about y_τ and the occupation at τ.\n\nIn the sequence, we start at τ=0 with y=1.\n\nWe take action a_τ at time τ, which sets y_{τ+1}.\n\nBut for collision, at each time τ, we have y_τ, and we check if collision.\n\nNow, for the direct up path:\n\nτ=0: y=1, which is safe (y=1 always safe)\n\nTake a=U, so y1 = 1+1=2\n\nNow at τ=1: position y=2\n\ny=2 occupied at τ=1? From above, y=2 occupied only at τ=0 and τ=4.\n\nτ=1 not occupied, so safe.\n\nThen take a=U, y2 = 2+1=3\n\nτ=2: y=3, occupied? y=3 occupied at τ=0 and τ=4, τ=2 not, so safe.\n\nTake a=U, y3=3+1=4\n\nτ=3: y=4, occupied? y=4 occupied at τ=0 only, τ=3 not 0, so safe? τ=0 is past.\n\nAt τ=3, y=4, freeway 4 occupied only at τ=0, so at τ=3 not occupied, safe.\n\nTake a=U, y4=4+1=5\n\nτ=4: y=5, occupied? y=5 occupied only at τ=0, τ=4 not, so safe.\n\nTake a=U, y5=5+1=6\n\nτ=5: y=6, occupied? y=6 occupied at τ=2 and τ=3, τ=5 not, so safe.\n\nTake a=U, y6=6+1=7\n\nτ=6: y=7, occupied? y=7 occupied at τ=10,11,12, τ=6 not, so safe.\n\nTake a=U, y7=7+1=8\n\nτ=7: y=8, occupied? y=8 occupied at τ=10,11,12,13, τ=7 not, so safe.\n\nTake a=U, y8=8+1=9\n\nτ=8: y=9, which is goal, no collision since y=9 safe.\n\nAt τ=8, we reach y=9.\n\nNow, actions: from τ=0 to τ=7, we take actions to go from y=1 to y=9 in 8 steps? Let's list:\n\nAt τ=0: position y=1, take action a=U, then y1=2\n\nAt τ=1: position y=2, take a=U, y2=3\n\n...\n\nUp to at τ=7: position y=8, take a=U, y8=9 at τ=8.\n\nSo we reach y=9 at τ=8, after 8 actions.\n\nActions taken at τ=0 to τ=7, 8 actions, H=8 turns? H is the number of turns, so from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAt turn t1 + τ for τ from 0 to H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1 + H, position y_H.\n\nWe want y_H =9 for some H.\n\nIn this case, with 8 actions: actions at τ=0 to 7, then at τ=8, y=9.\n\nτ=8 is turn t1+8.\n\nMinimal H such that after H actions, we reach y=9.\n\nEach action advances time by one turn.\n\nStart: at turn t1, position y=1.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, we go to turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1} = y_t1 + Δy\n\nSimilarly, after H actions, at turn t1+H, position y_{t1+H}\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nH actions.\n\nIn the path above: we take U at each turn from t1 to t1+7, that's 8 actions.\n\nAt turn t1+8, position y=9.\n\nSo H=8.\n\nNow, check if any collision during the path.\n\nAt each turn, when we are at a freeway, check if occupied.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn τ=0 (t1): y=1, safe\n\nAfter U, at τ=1: y=2, not occupied (since only τ=0 and τ=4, τ=1 not)\n\nAt τ=1: position y=2, which is freeway 2, occupied only at τ=0 and τ=4, so at τ=1 not occupied, safe.\n\nAt τ=2: y=3, freeway 3, occupied τ=0 and τ=4, τ=2 not, safe.\n\nAt τ=3: y=4, freeway 4, occupied only τ=0, τ=3 not, safe.\n\nAt τ=4: y=5, freeway 5, occupied only τ=0, τ=4 not, safe.\n\nAt τ=5: y=6, freeway 6, occupied τ=2 and τ=3, τ=5 not, safe.\n\nAt τ=6: y=7, freeway 7, occupied τ=10,11,12, τ=6 not, safe.\n\nAt τ=7: y=8, freeway 8, occupied τ=10,11,12,13, τ=7 not, safe.\n\nAt τ=8: y=9, goal, safe.\n\nNo collision at any point.\n\nBut at τ=0, we were at y=1, which is safe, and we moved up.\n\nIs there any issue?\n\nEarlier for y=6, occupied at τ=2 and τ=3.\n\nAt τ=2, we were at y=3, not y=6.\n\nAt τ=3, we were at y=4, not y=6.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nSimilarly, later occupations are at higher τ, we are past.\n\nSo we can reach in 8 turns with all U actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the starting point.\n\nPlayer at (0,1) at turn t1=75.\n\nAction at turn 75: U, to go to y=2 at next turn.\n\nAt turn 75, position is (0,1), after action U, at turn 76, position (0,2).\n\nCollision at turn T: if at that turn, player on freeway, and occupied.\n\nAt turn 75 (τ=0), player at y=1, freeway 1 occupied? We said never, so safe.\n\nAt turn 76 (τ=1), player at y=2, freeway 2 occupied? At τ=1, not occupied, as above.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut is freeway 1 really always safe? Earlier calculation: car span at T: [1 +48τ, 48+48τ], left end >=1 >0, so x=0 never covered, yes.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the path, we go through y=2 at τ=1, which is not occupied time.\n\nBut τ=0 is occupied for y=2, but at τ=0 we are at y=1, not y=2.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster? From y=1 to y=9, minimum 8 steps, since each up moves one, and we start at y=1, so need 8 ups to reach y=9.\n\ny=1 to y=2: one up, ..., to y=9: 8 ups.\n\nCannot do in less than 8 turns.\n\nWith stay or down, it would take more turns, so minimal H=8.\n\nAnd with all U, it works without collision.\n\nBut let's double-check if at any point we might be on an occupied freeway.\n\nFor example, at τ=4, y=5 is free, but y=2 is occupied at τ=4? y=2 occupied at τ=4, but at τ=4 we are at y=5, not y=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 occupied at τ=2 and 3, but we are at y=3 and y=4 at those times.\n\nAll fine.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider the action sequence.\n\nSo actions: from turn t1 to t1+7, all U.\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1} = U\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nTurn t1+7: a_{t1+7} = U\n\nThen at turn t1+8, position (0,9).\n\nH=8.\n\nBut in the answer format, we need to list actions for turns starting from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nHere H=8, so actions at t1 to t1+7.\n\nBut let's write with t1=75.\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\n...\n\nTurn 82: U? t1=75, t1+0=75, t1+1=76, ..., t1+7=82.\n\nThen at turn 83, y=9.\n\nBut turn 83 is after the actions.\n\nNow, the sequence: {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to 7.\n\na_{75}, a_{76}, ..., a_{82} all U.\n\nBut is there a problem with freeway 1? No.\n\nAnother thing: when moving, if we move to a new y, we are not on that freeway until the next turn.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for y=6, occupied at τ=2 and 3, but we are not there.\n\nBut let's list the occupation again to be sure.\n\nFreeway occupation times:\n\ny=1: never\n\ny=2: τ=0 and τ=4\n\ny=3: τ=0 and τ=4\n\ny=4: τ=0\n\ny=5: τ=0\n\ny=6: τ=2 and τ=3\n\ny=7: τ=10,11,12\n\ny=8: τ=10,11,12,13\n\nIn our path:\n\nτ=0: y=1, safe\n\nτ=1: y=2, not occupied (τ=1 not in {0,4})\n\nτ=2: y=3, not occupied (τ=2 not in {0,4})\n\nτ=3: y=4, not occupied (τ=3 not 0)\n\nτ=4: y=5, not occupied (τ=4 not 0)\n\nτ=5: y=6, not occupied (τ=5 not in {2,3})\n\nτ=6: y=7, not occupied (τ=6 <10)\n\nτ=7: y=8, not occupied (τ=7<10)\n\nτ=8: y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nSo minimal H=8 with all U actions.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do.\n\nPerhaps we can start with stay or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nOr go down, but that seems worse.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 6 at τ=2 and τ=3.\n\nAt τ=2, y=6 occupied, but we are at y=3.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, for freeway 7 and 8, occupations late, we pass early.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 8 turns.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to write it out.\n\nSince t1=75, turns from 75 to 82.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 75: U\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: U\nTurn 78: U\nTurn 79: U\nTurn 80: U\nTurn 81: U\nTurn 82: U\n}\n\nH=8, actions from t=0 to 7 relative.\n\nBut is turn 82 the last action? Actions at turn 75 to 82, that's 8 actions.\n\nAt turn 82, after action U, position y=9 at turn 83.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we need to specify only the actions, no need for position.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 8 actions.\n\nBut let's see if we can do with less? From y=1 to y=9, must increase by 8, each action can increase by at most 1, so minimum 8 actions, so H=8 is minimal.\n\nAnd it works.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 2 and 3, at τ=0 occupied, but we are not on them at τ=0, we are on y=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother point: the note says \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", which is consistent with what we have.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 4 and 5, occupied at τ=0, but we start at y=1, not on them.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 8 with all U actions.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 1) on turn 75 and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The vertical distance from y=1 to y=9 is 8 units, requiring at least 8 \"U\" (up) actions to reach y=9, as each \"U\" increases y by 1.\n- Collision occurs only if the player is on a freeway (y=1 to 8) at a turn when x=0 is occupied by a car on that freeway.\n- The occupation times for each freeway at x=0 (relative to turn τ = T - 75) are:\n  - y=1: never occupied (always safe).\n  - y=2: occupied at τ=0 and τ=4.\n  - y=3: occupied at τ=0 and τ=4.\n  - y=4: occupied at τ=0 only.\n  - y=5: occupied at τ=0 only.\n  - y=6: occupied at τ=2 and τ=3.\n  - y=7: occupied at τ=10, 11, 12.\n  - y=8: occupied at τ=10, 11, 12, 13.\n- A sequence of 8 consecutive \"U\" actions, starting from turn 75, avoids all collisions:\n  - At τ=0 (turn 75): y=1 (safe, as y=1 is never occupied).\n  - At τ=1 (turn 76): y=2 (not occupied, as τ=1 not in {0,4}).\n  - At τ=2 (turn 77): y=3 (not occupied, as τ=2 not in {0,4}).\n  - At τ=3 (turn 78): y=4 (not occupied, as τ=3 ≠ 0).\n  - At τ=4 (turn 79): y=5 (not occupied, as τ=4 ≠ 0).\n  - At τ=5 (turn 80): y=6 (not occupied, as τ=5 not in {2,3}).\n  - At τ=6 (turn 81): y=7 (not occupied, as τ=6 < 10).\n  - At τ=7 (turn 82): y=8 (not occupied, as τ=7 < 10).\n  - At τ=8 (turn 83): y=9 (goal, safe as y=9 has no cars).\n- This sequence reaches y=9 in 8 turns (H=8), which is minimal since fewer turns are impossible (each \"U\" gains only 1 unit vertically).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions for turns 75 to 82 (H=8 actions) are all \"U\".\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 75: U \\\\\nTurn 76: U \\\\\nTurn 77: U \\\\\nTurn 78: U \\\\\nTurn 79: U \\\\\nTurn 80: U \\\\\nTurn 81: U \\\\\nTurn 82: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row at a certain turn, no car on that row has a span that includes 0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, since I start at y=2, and I need to go to y=9, I probably need to move up. But I have to go through rows 3 to 8, each with cars moving at different speeds and directions.\n\nThe player position is only updated after the action, so when I take an action at turn t, I move to y_{t+1} based on that action. Also, the collision check is only for the freeway I'm on at that turn. Importantly, when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn t, at turn t I'm still on y, and at turn t+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t_1 = 76.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nActions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same).\n\ny must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I have cars with head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nDirection: right or left. From the update, left-moving: span moves left, so head decreases. Right-moving: span moves right, head increases.\n\nIn the car state table, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (96, 49, right, 48)\n\nSince direction is right, head should be the right end, I think? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIt says Span(t1) = [τ, h] for right-moving, with τ and h, but in the table it's given as (head, tail), so I need to interpret which is head and tail.\n\nLook: for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then moves to [τ + sΔ, h + sΔ], so since it's moving right, τ must be the left end and h the right end? But it says \"head\" and \"tail\".\n\nProbably, \"head\" is the front of the car, so for right-moving, head is on the right, for left-moving, head is on the left.\n\nIn the update rule, for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔ, τ - sΔ]\", so here [h, τ] with h decreasing, so h is the left end for left-moving? Let's clarify.\n\nAssume that \"head\" is the leading end of the car.\n\nFor left-moving car, head is left, so when moving left, head decreases.\n\nIn left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and moves to [h - sΔ, τ - sΔ], so if it's moving left, the span shifts left, so h is the left end, τ is the right end? But it says \"head\" and \"tail\", so head should be the direction of movement.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" → [τ + sΔ, h + sΔ], and since moving right, τ must be left, h must be right, so head is h, right end.\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, it's (head, tail) but in span it's [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd in the car state, it's given as (head, tail), so for this, head is h, tail is τ.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔ, τ - sΔ]\", so head is h, tail is τ.\n\nSo in general, the span is from tail to head, with head being the leading end.\n\nFor right-moving, tail left, head right.\n\nFor left-moving, tail right, head left? In left-moving, span [h, τ] with h decreasing, so if h is head, and it decreases when moving left, so head is on the left for left-moving car.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head on right.\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, for the freeway y_T, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\n0 is the x-position we care about, since player is at (0, y).\n\nNow, for each freeway and each car, I need to find when 0 is covered by the car at a given turn.\n\nThe turn is relative to t_1=76.\n\nLet Δt = T - t_1, so at time T, Δt turns after t_1.\n\nFor each car, the span at time T is:\n\nFor right-moving car: [τ + s * Δt, h + s * Δt]\n\nFor left-moving car: [h - s * Δt, τ - s * Δt]\n\nCollision if for some car on row k, 0 is in [low, high] where low and high are the min and max of the span.\n\nSince the span might not be in order, but in the definition, for right-moving it's [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] and since τ < h (I assume, as tail and head), so it's increasing.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt], and since h is left, τ is right, h < τ, so [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt] and since moving left, h - sΔt < τ - sΔt, so it's increasing from left to right.\n\nFor left-moving, at t1, span is [h, τ], with h and τ, and h - sΔt, τ - sΔt, and since h < τ (head left, tail right), so min is h - sΔt, max is τ - sΔt.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, min τ + sΔt, max h + sΔt.\n\nNow, 0 in [min, max] for the car on that row.\n\nAlso, multiple cars per row, so need to check all for that row.\n\nNow, for row k, at time T, collision if 0 in any car's span on row k.\n\nPlayer is on row y at time T if after action at T-1, y_T = k, so during turn T, player is on row k.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, player performs action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen, at turn t+1, player is at position (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nNow, collision is checked at each turn: at turn T, player is on row y_T, and we check if 0 is in any car's span on row y_T at time T.\n\nThe car positions are given at t1, and we compute for time T.\n\nIn the collision condition: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the row at turn T.\n\ny_T is determined by the actions up to turn T-1.\n\nFor example, at turn t1, player is at y=2, so during turn t1, player is on row 2.\n\nThen after action a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} is set.\n\nAt turn t1+1, player is on row y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nNow, for row 2, at turn t1=76, is there a car? Freeways are y=1 to 8, row 2 is freeway 2.\n\nFreeway k corresponds to row y=k, I assume.\n\nIn the table, freeway k from 1 to 8.\n\nPlayer starts on row 2, which is freeway 2.\n\nAt turn t1=76, player is on row 2, so we need to check if there is collision at turn t1 for row 2.\n\nSimilarly for future turns.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each row at t1.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): one car: (head, tail, dir, speed) = (96, 49, right, 48)\n\nSince right-moving, span at t1: [τ, h] = [49, 96]? Earlier: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], with τ tail, h head.\n\nGiven (head, tail) = (96, 49), so head=96, tail=49, so τ=49, h=96, so span [49, 96] at t1.\n\nAs time increases, span [49 + 48Δt, 96 + 48Δt]\n\nCollision at time T if 0 in [49 + 48Δt, 96 + 48Δt] for Δt = T - 76.\n\nSince min is 49 + 48Δt, which for Δt >=0, min >=49 >0, so 0 never in span, so no collision possible on row 1 for any time. Good, since we start there but need to leave.\n\nAt t1, player is on row 2, not row 1.\n\nPlayer is at (0,2), so row 2.\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): cars: (12, 1, right, 12) and (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head=12, tail=1, dir=right, speed=12.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [1, 12] since τ=tail=1, h=head=12? Head=12, tail=1, so for right-moving, span [tail, head] = [1,12]\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=-36, tail=-47? Given (-36, -47, right, 12), so head=-36, tail=-47.\n\nSince tail=-47, head=-36, and right-moving, span [tail, head] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt t1, for row 2, cars cover [1,12] and [-47,-36], neither contains 0, so at t1, no collision on row 2.\n\nAs time increases, first car span: [1 + 12Δt, 12 + 12Δt]\n\nSecond car: [-47 + 12Δt, -36 + 12Δt]\n\n0 will be in first span when 1 + 12Δt <= 0 <= 12 + 12Δt, but 1 + 12Δt >=1 >0 for Δt>=0, so 0 < min, never in.\n\nSimilarly, second car min -47 +12Δt, max -36 +12Δt, 0 in if -47 +12Δt <=0 <= -36 +12Δt, so 0 <= -36 +12Δt? That would require 12Δt >=36, Δt>=3, and -47 +12Δt <=0 so 12Δt <=47, Δt <=47/12≈3.916, so for Δt=3,4? Let's see:\n\nAt Δt=3: min = -47 + 36 = -11, max = -36 + 36 = 0\n\n0 <= max=0, so 0 is included if [min, max] includes endpoints, I assume it does.\n\nmin=-11, max=0, so [ -11, 0], yes 0 included.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=4: min=-47+48=1, max=-36+48=12, min=1>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo at Δt=3, T=76+3=79, for row 2, second car span [-11,0], contains 0.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=2: min=-47+24=-23, max=-36+24=-12, both <0, 0 not in.\n\nΔt=1: min=-35, max=-24, both <0.\n\nΔt=3: min=-11, max=0, contains 0.\n\nSo at T=79, if player is on row 2, collision with second car.\n\nBut player may not be there.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): cars: (12,1,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12) same as row 2.\n\nGiven: | 3 | (12, 1, right, 12), (-36, -47, right, 12) |\n\nIdentical to row 2.\n\nSo similarly, at T=79, collision possible if on row 3.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nFirst car: [1 +12Δt, 12+12Δt], min>0 always.\n\nSecond car: [-47+12Δt, -36+12Δt], contains 0 when -47+12Δt <=0 and 0<= -36+12Δt? 0 <= max and min <=0.\n\n-47+12Δt <=0 and -36+12Δt >=0\n\nFrom -36+12Δt >=0, 12Δt >=36, Δt>=3\n\n-47+12Δt <=0, 12Δt <=47, Δt<=3.916, so Δt=3,4? Δt=3: min=-47+36=-11<=0, max=-36+36=0>=0, so yes.\n\nΔt=4: min=-47+48=1>0, 0 not <= min? min=1>0, so not.\n\nSo only at Δt=3, T=79.\n\nSimilarly for row 2 and 3.\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): car: (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nLeft-moving, so head and tail: given (head, tail) = (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nFor left-moving, span at t1: [h, τ] = [head, tail]? From update: Span(t1) = [h, τ] for left-moving.\n\nh=head, τ=tail.\n\nIn this case head=-60, tail=-25.\n\nSince left-moving, head is left end, tail is right end? At t1, span [h, τ] = [-60, -25]\n\nAs time increases, span [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt] = [-60 -36Δt, -25 -36Δt]\n\nNow, min = -60 -36Δt, max = -25 -36Δt, both decreasing.\n\n0 in span if min <=0 <= max.\n\nBut min and max both negative for all Δt>=0, since -25 -36Δt <= -25 <0, so max <0, thus 0 not in span ever. So no collision on row 4.\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): similar, (-60, -25, left, 36), same as above, no collision.\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): car: (-6, -17, right, 6)\n\n(-6, -17, right, 6)\n\nHead=-6, tail=-17, right-moving.\n\nSpan: [τ, h] = [tail, head] = [-17, -6]\n\nAt time T: [-17 + 6Δt, -6 + 6Δt]\n\n0 in span if -17 +6Δt <=0 <= -6 +6Δt\n\nSo -17 +6Δt <=0 and 0 <= -6 +6Δt\n\nFrom 0 <= -6 +6Δt, 6Δt >=6, Δt >=1\n\nFrom -17 +6Δt <=0, 6Δt <=17, Δt <=17/6≈2.833\n\nSo Δt=1,2\n\nΔt=1: min=-17+6=-11, max=-6+6=0, so [ -11, 0] contains 0\n\nΔt=2: min=-17+12=-5, max=-6+12=6, [ -5,6] contains 0\n\nΔt=3: min=-17+18=1, max=-6+18=12, min=1>0, 0 not in\n\nSo at Δt=1 and 2, T=77 and 78, collision if on row 6.\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): cars: (-36, -47, right, 4) and (28, 17, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: head=-36, tail=-47, right, speed=4\n\nSpan: [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt T: [-47 +4Δt, -36 +4Δt]\n\n0 in if -47+4Δt <=0 <= -36+4Δt\n\nSo -47+4Δt <=0 and 0 <= -36+4Δt\n\n0 <= -36+4Δt => 4Δt >=36, Δt >=9\n\n-47+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=47, Δt <=11.75\n\nSo for Δt=9 to 11 inclusive.\n\nΔt=9: min=-47+36=-11, max=-36+36=0, contains 0\n\nΔt=10: min=-47+40=-7, max=-36+40=4, contains 0\n\nΔt=11: min=-47+44=-3, max=-36+44=8, contains 0\n\nΔt=12: min=-47+48=1, max=-36+48=12, min>0, not.\n\nNow second car on row 7: (28,17,right,4) head=28, tail=17, span [17,28] at t1\n\nAt T: [17+4Δt, 28+4Δt], min=17+4Δt >=17>0, so never contains 0.\n\nSo for row 7, only the first car causes collision at Δt=9,10,11 i.e. T=85,86,87.\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): car: (-27, -38, right, 3)\n\nHead=-27, tail=-38, right, speed=3\n\nSpan: [τ, h] = [-38, -27]\n\nAt T: [-38 +3Δt, -27 +3Δt]\n\n0 in if -38+3Δt <=0 <= -27+3Δt\n\nSo -38+3Δt <=0 and 0 <= -27+3Δt\n\n0 <= -27+3Δt => 3Δt >=27, Δt >=9\n\n-38+3Δt <=0 => 3Δt <=38, Δt <=38/3≈12.666\n\nSo Δt=9 to 12.\n\nΔt=9: min=-38+27=-11, max=-27+27=0, [ -11,0] contains 0\n\nΔt=10: min=-38+30=-8, max=-27+30=3, contains 0\n\nΔt=11: min=-38+33=-5, max=-27+33=6, contains 0\n\nΔt=12: min=-38+36=-2, max=-27+36=9, contains 0\n\nΔt=13: min=-38+39=1, max=-27+39=12, min>0, not.\n\nSo collision on row 8 at T=85,86,87,88 (since Δt=9,10,11,12, T=76+9=85 to 88)\n\nNow, player starts at y=2 at turn 76.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars, just need to reach (0,9).\n\ny=9 is the top, no freeway, so no collision there.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be bottom, but we start at 2 and go up.\n\nNow, the minimal number of turns: since we need to go from y=2 to y=9, that's 7 steps up, but we can stay or move down, but to minimize turns, probably go up as much as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nEach U action increases y by 1, S keeps same, D decreases.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=2, we need at least 7 U actions, but since we can have S or D, H could be more than 7, but minimal H should be 7 if we can go up every turn without collision.\n\nBut we have to check for each step if moving to the next row causes collision at that turn.\n\nSince we move to a new row at turn t+1 after action at t.\n\nLet me define the state.\n\nLet t = 0 relative to t1, so at turn t1 + k for k=0,1,2,...\n\nAt k=0, turn t1=76, player at y=2.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + k}, y_{t1 + k +1} is set.\n\nAt turn T = t1 + k, player is on row y_{t1 + k}.\n\nFor each k, when we are on row y at turn t1 + k, we need no collision, meaning for that row y and time t1 + k, 0 not in any car span on row y.\n\nThen after H-1 actions, at turn t1 + (H-1), player should be at y=9? Let's see.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, we have performed actions from t=0 to H-2? Let's index properly.\n\nStart at turn t1: y_{t1} = 2\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2}, and so on.\n\nAfter t actions, we have y_{t1 + t}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H-1} = 9? No.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1: actions a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter a_{t1}, y_{t1+1}\n\nAfter a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t1 + H-2}, y_{t1 + H-1}\n\nAfter a_{t1 + H-1}, y_{t1 + H}\n\nWe want to reach (0,9), so y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nAnd we need y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nThe position after H actions is y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nBut at turn t1 + H, player is at y_{t1 + H} = 9, which is not a freeway, so no collision check needed, I think.\n\nCollision only on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nSo when we are at y=9, no issue.\n\nNow, during the path, for each turn from t1 to t1 + H-1, when player is on some y between 1 and 8, we need no collision at that turn for that row.\n\nSpecifically, for each turn T from t1 to t1 + H-1, if y_T is between 1 and 8, then no car on row y_T should have 0 in span at time T.\n\nNow, at turn t1 + H, if y_{t1+H} =9, not on freeway, no check.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to reach y=9 as fast as possible, so ideally in 7 turns: from y=2 to y=9 in 7 steps, with 7 U actions.\n\nSo actions: U,U,U,U,U,U,U in 7 turns.\n\nThen after 7 actions, y_{t1+7} = 2 + 7 =9.\n\nNow, we need to check for each turn from T=76 to T=82 inclusive? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T=76: player at y=2, row 2.\n\nWe need no collision at T=76 for row 2.\n\nAt T=76, Δt=0, row 2 cars: [1,12] and [-47,-36], neither contains 0, so ok.\n\nThen action a_{76} = U, so y_{77} = 3.\n\nAt turn T=77: player at y=3, row 3.\n\nCheck row 3 at T=77, Δt=1.\n\nRow 3 cars same as row 2: (12,1,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nAt Δt=1: first car [1+12(1), 12+12(1)] = [13,24], not contain 0.\n\nSecond car: [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24], not contain 0.\n\nOk.\n\nAction a_{77} = U, y_{78} =4.\n\nTurn T=78: player at y=4, row 4.\n\nRow 4: car (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nAt T=78, Δt=2, span: [-60 -36(2), -25 -36(2)] = [-60-72, -25-72] = [-132,-97], not contain 0. Ok.\n\nAction a_{78} = U, y_{79} =5.\n\nTurn T=79: player at y=5, row 5.\n\nRow 5 same as row 4? Freeway 5: (-60,-25,left,36), same as row 4.\n\nAt T=79, Δt=3, span: [-60-36(3), -25-36(3)] = [-60-108, -25-108] = [-168,-133], not contain 0. Ok.\n\nAction a_{79} = U, y_{80} =6.\n\nTurn T=80: player at y=6, row 6.\n\nRow 6: car (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nAt T=80, Δt=4? T=80, t1=76, Δt=4.\n\nSpan: [-17 +6(4), -6 +6(4)] = [-17+24, -6+24] = [7,18], min=7>0, not contain 0. Ok.\n\nBut earlier we saw that at Δt=1 and 2, it did contain 0, but at Δt=4, not.\n\nAction a_{80} = U, y_{81} =7.\n\nTurn T=81: player at y=7, row 7.\n\nRow 7 cars: (-36,-47,right,4) and (28,17,right,4)\n\nAt T=81, Δt=5.\n\nFirst car: [-47 +4(5), -36 +4(5)] = [-47+20, -36+20] = [-27,-16], not contain 0.\n\nSecond car: [17+20, 28+20] = [37,48], not contain 0. Ok.\n\nAction a_{81} = U, y_{82} =8.\n\nTurn T=82: player at y=8, row 8.\n\nRow 8: car (-27,-38,right,3)\n\nAt T=82, Δt=6.\n\nSpan: [-38 +3(6), -27 +3(6)] = [-38+18, -27+18] = [-20,-9], not contain 0. Ok.\n\nThen action a_{82} = U, y_{83} =9.\n\nNow at turn T=83, player at y=9, not freeway, no collision.\n\nSo with 7 actions: U at t76 to U at t82, we reach y=9 at t83.\n\nH=7 turns? Actions from t76 to t82, that's 7 actions, y from 2 to 3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nAfter 7 actions, y_{t1+7} = y_{83} =9.\n\nAnd for each turn from T=76 to 82, we were on row 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 respectively, and at those times, no collision as above.\n\nAt T=79, we were on row 5, which is fine.\n\nBut earlier I thought row 2 and 3 have issue at T=79, but at T=79 we were on row 5, not row 2 or 3.\n\nIn this path: at T=76: y=2\n\nT=77: y=3\n\nT=78: y=4\n\nT=79: y=5\n\nT=80: y=6\n\nT=81: y=7\n\nT=82: y=8\n\nAll safe as above.\n\nThen T=83: y=9, done.\n\nSo minimal H=7, with all U actions.\n\nBut is that correct? Let me double-check the collision times.\n\nFor row 6: collision at T=77 and 78? T=77: Δt=1, span [-17+6(1), -6+6] = [-11,0] at T=77, which contains 0.\n\nBut in the path, at T=77, we are on row 3, not row 6.\n\nAt T=77, we are moving to y=4? At turn T=77, player is at y_{77}, which is 3, after action at t76.\n\ny_{t1} = y_{76} =2\n\nAfter a_{76}=U, y_{77}=3\n\nAt turn T=77, player on row 3.\n\nRow 6 is different.\n\nSimilarly, at T=78, player on row 4.\n\nRow 6 collision at T=78: Δt=2, T=78, Δt=2, span [-17+12, -6+12] = [-5,6] contains 0.\n\nBut at T=78, we are on row 4, not row 6.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other rows have collision at later times, but we pass through earlier or later.\n\nFor example, row 7 collision at T=85,86,87, we are there at T=81, which is earlier, Δt=5, span [-27,-16] for first car, no issue.\n\nSimilarly row 8 at T=85-88, we at T=82, Δt=6, span [-20,-9], no issue.\n\nSo with 7 consecutive U, we reach in 7 actions.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence of actions.\n\nH=7, actions a_{76} to a_{82} all U.\n\nBut let's confirm the starting point.\n\nPlayer position at turn t1=76 is (0,2), so after actions, we reach (0,9) at turn 83.\n\nThe sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, with H actions.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, ..., up to turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAfter these H actions, y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nHere H=7, so actions at t76 to t82.\n\na_{76} to a_{82}.\n\nAll U.\n\nBut is there any problem?\n\nEarlier I thought row 2 has collision at T=79, but in this path, at T=79 we are on row 5, not row 2.\n\nSimilarly, row 3 same.\n\nBut what if we were on row 2 or 3 at T=79, but we are not.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster? From y=2 to y=9, minimum 7 steps, so H=7 is minimum possible.\n\nUnless we can skip rows, but no, each U increases by one, so 7 U needed.\n\nS or D would make it slower, so H=7 is minimum.\n\nThus, the sequence should be all U for 7 turns.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nThen at turn 83, y=9.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have 7 actions, from turn 76 to 82.\n\nBut the player reaches at turn 83, but the position is after the action.\n\nIn the answer, we list the actions for the turns.\n\nNow, but the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\"\n\nH is the number of actions, I think.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H\" and sequence of H actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me make sure that at no point we have collision.\n\nAnother thing: when we move, at the turn we are on the row, and we leave to another row.\n\nBut in this case, all seems fine.\n\nPerhaps I should check if we can go slower to avoid something, but not necessary.\n\nBut let's see row 6: if we were on row 6 at T=77 or 78, collision, but we are there at T=80, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nPerhaps for row 8, if we delay, might hit collision, but we are early.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nBut in the car state, for row 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but we covered.\n\nPerhaps I should output the sequence.\n\nBut the answer format.\n\nSo for H=7, actions all U.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 76: U \\\\ Turn 77: U \\\\ Turn 78: U \\\\ Turn 79: U \\\\ Turn 80: U \\\\ Turn 81: U \\\\ Turn 82: U }\n\nBut in the box, it should be like that.\n\nBut is there a reason to do otherwise? For example, if we go down or stay, it would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nThus, this should be the answer.\n\nBut let me confirm the initial position.\n\nPlayer at (0,2) at turn 76.\n\nAfter U at 76, to y=3 at turn 77.\n\nAt turn 77, on row 3, which at Δt=1, no collision as above.\n\nSimilarly all.\n\nPerhaps I should list the y at each turn to verify.\n\nTurn 76: y=2, action U, to y=3\n\nTurn 77: y=3, action U, to y=4\n\nTurn 78: y=4, action U, to y=5\n\nTurn 79: y=5, action U, to y=6\n\nTurn 80: y=6, action U, to y=7\n\nTurn 81: y=7, action U, to y=8\n\nTurn 82: y=8, action U, to y=9\n\nTurn 83: y=9, done.\n\nAt each turn T, row y_T:\n\nT=76: row 2, safe\n\nT=77: row 3, safe\n\nT=78: row 4, safe\n\nT=79: row 5, safe\n\nT=80: row 6, at Δt=4, span [7,18] no 0\n\nT=81: row 7, at Δt=5, first car [-27,-16] no, second [37,48] no\n\nT=82: row 8, at Δt=6, [-20,-9] no\n\nAll good.\n\nSo minimal H=7 with all U.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\" and we did.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if going directly up causes collision on some row at the time we are there, but in this case not.\n\nFor example, if we were to be on row 6 at T=78, it would be bad, but we are at T=80, fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 76\\) and needs to reach \\((0, 9)\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 7, achieved by moving up (U) in every turn from turn 76 to turn 82. This sequence increases the y-coordinate from 2 to 9 in 7 steps without any collisions, as verified below:\n\n- **Turn 76**: Player at \\(y = 2\\). Action U moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 77.  \n  - At turn 76, on row 2: cars at \\((12, 1, \\text{right}, 12)\\) and \\((-36, -47, \\text{right}, 12)\\).  \n    - Span at \\(\\Delta t = 0\\): \\([1, 12]\\) and \\([-47, -36]\\), neither contains 0. Safe.\n\n- **Turn 77**: Player at \\(y = 3\\). Action U moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 78.  \n  - At turn 77, on row 3: cars same as row 2 (given identical state).  \n    - Span at \\(\\Delta t = 1\\): \\([1+12(1), 12+12(1)] = [13, 24]\\) and \\([-47+12, -36+12] = [-35, -24]\\), neither contains 0.

Action U moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 79.  \n  - At turn 78, on row 4: car at \\((-60, -25, \\text{left}, 36)\\).  \n    - Span at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\): \\([-60 - 36(2), -25 - 36(2)] = [-132, -97]\\), does not contain 0. Safe.\n\n- **Turn 79**: Player at \\(y = 5\\). Action U moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 80.  \n  - At turn 79, on row 5: car same as row 4 (given identical state).  \n    - Span at \\(\\Delta t = 3\\): \\([-60 - 36(3), -25 - 36(3)] = [-168, -133]\\), does not contain 0. Safe.\n\n- **Turn 80**: Player at \\(y = 6\\). Action U moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 81.  \n  - At turn 80, on row 6: car at \\((-6, -17, \\text{right}, 6)\\).  \n    - Span at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\): \\([-17 + 6(4), -6 + 6(4)] = [7, 18]\\), does not contain 0. Safe.\n\n- **Turn 81**: Player at \\(y = 7\\). Action U moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 82.  \n  - At turn 81, on row 7: cars at \\((-36, -47, \\text{right}, 4)\\) and \\((28, 17, \\text{right}, 4)\\).  \n    - Span at \\(\\Delta t = 5\\): \\([-47 + 4(5), -36 + 4(5)] = [-27, -16]\\) and \\([17 + 4(5), 28 + 4(5)] = [37, 48]\\), neither contains 0. Safe.\n\n- **Turn 82**: Player at \\(y = 8\\). Action U moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 83.  \n  - At turn 82, on row 8: car at \\((-27, -38, \\text{right}, 3)\\).  \n    - Span at \\(\\Delta t = 6\\): \\([-38 + 3(6), -27 + 3(6)] = [-20, -9]\\), does not contain 0. Safe.\n\nAt turn 83, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway, so no collision check is needed. The sequence of 7 U actions achieves the goal in minimal turns, as fewer than 7 actions cannot increase y from 2 to 9 (requiring at least 7 up moves).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 76: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 77: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 78: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 79: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 80: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 81: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 82: \\text{ U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. Cars move left or right at constant speeds, and I collide if I'm on a freeway where a car covers position x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should figure out where the cars are at each future turn relative to t_1=77. The player is at y=3 at turn 77, and I need to reach y=9.\n\nLet me list all the cars and their movements.\n\nStarting with freeway 1: only one car: head -48, tail -95, direction right, speed 48. Since it's moving right, at time T, position is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nInitially at t_1, head h, tail τ, so for right-moving, if it's moving right, head is larger, so [τ, h] with τ < h, and then [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] where ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head is smaller, [h, τ] with h < τ, then [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT].\n\nIn this case, freeway 1: head -48, tail -95, direction right. But head -48, tail -95? -48 is greater than -95, so if right-moving, head should be larger, which it is, -48 > -95.\n\nSo tail τ = -95, head h = -48.\n\nAt T, Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-95 + 48ΔT, -48 + 48ΔT]\n\nI need to know when this car covers x=0.\n\nSet -95 + 48ΔT <= 0 <= -48 + 48ΔT\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst, -95 + 48ΔT <= 0 => 48ΔT <= 95 => ΔT <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so ΔT <= 1 since ΔT integer? ΔT is number of turns, so integer.\n\nT - t_1 is integer, yes.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -48 + 48ΔT => 48ΔT >= 48 => ΔT >=1\n\nAnd from left: -95 + 48ΔT <=0 => ΔT <= floor(95/48) = 1 since 48*1=48<95, 48*2=96>95, so ΔT <=1? 48*1=48, -95+48= -47 <=0? -47 <=0 true, and -48+48=0 <=0, which is equal, so at ΔT=1, Span = [-95+48, -48+48] = [-47, 0]\n\nSo at ΔT=1, T=t_1+1, position x=0 is covered since -47 <=0<=0.\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=t_1, Span = [-95, -48], -48 to -95? No, [τ, h] = [-95, -48], so from -95 to -48, all negative, 0 not covered.\n\nAt ΔT=2, Span = [-95+96, -48+96] = [1,48], 0 not covered.\n\nSo only at ΔT=1, T=78, x=0 is covered on freeway 1.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,12)\n\nHead 24, tail 13, direction right. Head 24, tail 13? 24>13, so head larger, yes.\n\nτ=13, h=24? In the table it says (head h, tail τ), so for this car, h=24, τ=13.\n\nSince right-moving, at t_1, Span = [τ, h] = [13,24]\n\nThen at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [13 + 12ΔT, 24 + 12ΔT]\n\nx=0 covered when 13+12ΔT <=0 <=24+12ΔT\n\nBut 13+12ΔT <=0? 12ΔT <= -13, impossible since ΔT>=0, left side >=13>0, so never <=0. Similarly, 24+12ΔT always positive, so 0 never in [13+12ΔT,24+12ΔT] which is always positive. So this car never covers x=0.\n\nSecond car on freeway 2: (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nHead -24, tail -35? -24 > -35, so right-moving.\n\nh=-24, τ=-35\n\nAt t_1, [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nAt T, [-35 +12ΔT, -24 +12ΔT]\n\nx=0 covered when -35+12ΔT <=0 <= -24+12ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -35+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/12 ≈2.916, so ΔT <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24+12ΔT => 12ΔT >=24 => ΔT >=2\n\nSo at ΔT=2, both: -35+24= -11 <=0? -11<=0 true, and 0 <= -24+24=0, true. So covered at ΔT=2.\n\nAt ΔT=1: -35+12= -23 <=0 true, but 0 <= -24+12= -12? 0 <= -12 false, so not covered.\n\nAt ΔT=2: -35+24= -11 <=0 true, 0 <= -24+24=0 true.\n\nAt ΔT=3: -35+36=1 <=0 false, so no.\n\nSo only at ΔT=2, T=79, covered.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"3 | (24,13,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\" same as freeway 2.\n\nSo similarly, first car never covers x=0, second car covers at ΔT=2, T=79.\n\nFreeway 4: (48,83,left,36)\n\nDirection left, head 48, tail 83? For left-moving, head is smaller? The notation says \"head h, tail τ\", and for left-moving, it should be head smaller.\n\nHere direction left, head 48, tail 83, so 48<83, so head smaller, yes.\n\nSo for left-moving, at t_1, Span = [h, τ] = [48,83]\n\nThen at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] = [48 - 36ΔT, 83 - 36ΔT]\n\nx=0 covered when 48-36ΔT <=0 <=83-36ΔT\n\nFirst: 48-36ΔT <=0 => 36ΔT >=48 => ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so ΔT >=2 since integer.\n\nSecond: 0 <=83-36ΔT => 36ΔT <=83 => ΔT <=83/36≈2.305, so ΔT <=2.\n\nΔT >=2 and ΔT <=2, so only ΔT=2.\n\nAt ΔT=2: [48-72,83-72] = [-24,11], so -24 <=0<=11, yes covered.\n\nAt ΔT=1: [48-36,83-36]=[12,47], all positive, 0 not covered.\n\nAt ΔT=3: [48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25], all negative, 0 not covered.\n\nSo only at T= t_1 +2 =79.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same as 4, (48,83,left,36), so same, covers at T=79.\n\nNow freeway 6: (0,-11,right,6)\n\nHead 0, tail -11, direction right.\n\nh=0, τ=-11\n\nRight-moving, at t_1, [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T, [-11 +6ΔT, 0 +6ΔT] = [-11+6ΔT, 6ΔT]\n\nx=0 covered when -11+6ΔT <=0 <=6ΔT\n\nFirst: -11+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=11 => ΔT <=11/6≈1.833, so ΔT <=1\n\nSecond: 0 <=6ΔT always true for ΔT >=0, but at ΔT=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nAt ΔT=0: [-11,0], so -11<=0<=0, yes covered since 0 is included.\n\nAt ΔT=1: [-11+6,6]=[-5,6], -5<=0<=6, covered.\n\nAt ΔT=2: [-11+12,12]=[1,12], 0 not covered.\n\nSo covered at ΔT=0 and ΔT=1, i.e., T=77 and T=78.\n\nT=77 is current turn, but we start at turn t_1=77, player is at (0,3), and we need to avoid collision on freeways we are on.\n\nAt turn T, if we are on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, if 0 in Span(T), then collision.\n\nAt T=77, we are at y=3, so on freeway 3? Freeways are y=1 to 8, each row.\n\nPlayer is at some y, so on that freeway.\n\nAt turn 77, player is at y=3, so on freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 at T=77: we need to see if x=0 covered.\n\nFor freeway 3, cars: first car (24,13,right,12), [13,24] at t_1, all positive, 0 not covered.\n\nSecond car (-24,-35,right,12), [-35,-24] at t_1, all negative, 0 not covered? [-35,-24], min -35, max -24, both <0, so 0 not in [-35,-24], so not covered at t_1.\n\nSimilarly, at ΔT=0, not covered for freeway 3? Earlier for freeway 3 second car covers at ΔT=2, not at 0.\n\nBut for freeway 6, at ΔT=0, covered.\n\nBut at turn 77, we are on y=3, not y=6, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, for the path, we need to avoid when we are on a freeway that has car covering 0 at that turn.\n\nBack to freeway 6: covered at T=77 and T=78.\n\nT=77 is now, but we are not on y=6, so ok for now.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst: (-32,-43,right,4)\n\nHead -32, tail -43? -32 > -43, right-moving.\n\nh=-32, τ=-43\n\nAt t_1, [τ, h] = [-43, -32]\n\nAt T, [-43 +4ΔT, -32 +4ΔT]\n\nx=0 covered when -43+4ΔT <=0 <= -32+4ΔT\n\nFirst: -43+4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=43 => ΔT <=10.75, so ΔT <=10\n\nSecond: 0 <= -32+4ΔT => 4ΔT >=32 => ΔT >=8\n\nSo for ΔT from 8 to 10 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (32,21,right,4)\n\nHead 32, tail 21? 32>21, right-moving.\n\nh=32, τ=21\n\nAt t_1, [21,32]\n\nAt T, [21+4ΔT, 32+4ΔT], all positive, never covers 0.\n\nSo only first car matters, covers at ΔT=8,9,10, i.e., T=85,86,87.\n\nNow freeway 8: (-24,-35,right,3)\n\nHead -24, tail -35, right-moving.\n\nh=-24, τ=-35\n\nAt t_1, [-35,-24]\n\nAt T, [-35+3ΔT, -24+3ΔT]\n\nCovered when -35+3ΔT <=0 <= -24+3ΔT\n\nFirst: -35+3ΔT <=0 => 3ΔT <=35 => ΔT <=11.666, ΔT<=11\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24+3ΔT => 3ΔT >=24 => ΔT >=8\n\nSo ΔT from 8 to 11, T=85 to 88.\n\nNow summarize when each freeway has collision at x=0:\n\nFreeway 1: only at T=78 (ΔT=1)\n\nFreeway 2: at T=79 (ΔT=2) from the second car\n\nFreeway 3: at T=79 (ΔT=2) similarly\n\nFreeway 4: at T=79 (ΔT=2)\n\nFreeway 5: at T=79 (ΔT=2)\n\nFreeway 6: at T=77 and T=78\n\nFreeway 7: at T=85,86,87 (ΔT=8,9,10)\n\nFreeway 8: at T=85,86,87,88 (ΔT=8 to 11)\n\nPlayer starts at y=3 at turn 77.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9, which is freeway 9? y=9 is the top, not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe grid has y=0 to 9, freeways with cars are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so safe.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9), which is above freeway 8.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, I need to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when it has collision.\n\nStart at turn 77, y=3.\n\nAt turn 77, on y=3, which is freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 at T=77: as above, no collision, since cars not covering 0.\n\nWe can stay or move.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9, so probably go up.\n\nThe minimal steps to go from y=3 to y=9 is 6 steps up, but may need to wait or detour to avoid collisions.\n\nSince we can only change by +1,0,-1 per turn, min steps is 6 if we go up every turn.\n\nBut we need to check if we can do that without collision.\n\nPath: start turn 77, y=3.\n\nThen turn 78, if U, y=4\n\nTurn 79, U, y=5\n\nTurn 80, U, y=6\n\nTurn 81, U, y=7\n\nTurn 82, U, y=8\n\nTurn 83, U, y=9, done in 6 turns.\n\nBut need to check for each turn, when on a freeway, if collision.\n\nAt turn 77, y=3, freeway 3: no collision, as above.\n\nTurn 78, if y=4, freeway 4: at T=78, what is freeway 4?\n\nFreeway 4 at T=78, ΔT=1.\n\nEarlier, freeway 4: left-moving, [48 -36ΔT, 83-36ΔT]\n\nAt ΔT=1, [48-36,83-36]=[12,47], all positive, 0 not covered, so safe.\n\nTurn 79, y=5, freeway 5: similar to freeway 4, at ΔT=2? T=79, ΔT=2.\n\nFreeway 5 same as 4, at ΔT=2, [48-72,83-72]=[-24,11], which includes 0, since -24<=0<=11.\n\nOh, collision at T=79 on freeway 5.\n\nIf we are at y=5 on turn 79, we collide.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 also has collision at T=79, but we are not on it.\n\nBut on freeway 5 at T=79, collision.\n\nSo this path: at turn 79, if we are on y=5, we collide.\n\nSo cannot go directly up.\n\nAt turn 78, if we go to y=4, then turn 79 to y=5, but y=5 has collision at T=79.\n\nSo need to avoid being on y=5 at turn 79.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have issues.\n\nList the collision times per freeway:\n\ny=1: collision only at T=78\n\ny=2: at T=79\n\ny=3: at T=79? Freeway 3 at T=79: ΔT=2.\n\nFreeway 3: second car covers at ΔT=2, T=79, yes.\n\ny=4: at T=79\n\ny=5: at T=79\n\ny=6: at T=77 and T=78\n\ny=7: at T=85,86,87\n\ny=8: at T=85,86,87,88\n\nNow, at turn 77, we start at y=3, safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 by some turn.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, and we can be there.\n\nThe direct up path fails because at turn 79, if we are on y=5, collision.\n\ny=4 at turn 79? In the path above, at turn 79 we are on y=5.\n\nBut at turn 79, y=4 might be safe? Freeway 4 at T=79 has collision, as above.\n\nBut we are not on y=4 if we move.\n\nIn the sequence: turn 77: y=3\n\nTurn 78: if U, y=4\n\nTurn 79: if U, y=5\n\nSo at turn 79, on y=5, collision.\n\nCould we stay or go down at some point?\n\nTo avoid being on y=5 at turn 79.\n\nSince collision at T=79 on multiple freeways: y=2,3,4,5 all have collision at T=79.\n\ny=1 at T=78, y=6 at T=77 and 78.\n\ny=7 and 8 later.\n\nAt turn 79, y=1 to 5 all have collision? y=1 collision only at T=78, not at T=79.\n\ny=1 at T=78 collision, at T=79 no.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at T=77 and 78 collision, at T=79 no.\n\ny=6: at T=77 and 78 covered, at T=79: ΔT=2, [-11+12,12]=[1,12], 0 not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at T=79 collision, y=3 at T=79, y=4 at T=79, y=5 at T=79.\n\ny=1 at T=79: freeway 1 at ΔT=2, [1,48], safe.\n\nSo at turn 79, freeways with collision: y=2,3,4,5.\n\nSafe freeways at T=79: y=1, y=6, y=7, y=8.\n\ny=7 at T=79: ΔT=2, freeway 7 first car: at ΔT=2, [-43+8, -32+8]=[-35,-24], all negative, safe; second car safe. So y=7 safe at T=79.\n\ny=8 at T=79: ΔT=2, [-35+6, -24+6]=[-29,-18], all negative, safe.\n\nSo at turn 79, we can be on y=1,6,7,8 safely.\n\nBut we are coming from below.\n\nNow, back to turn 77, y=3.\n\nOptions: we can go U, D, or S.\n\nIf S, stay at y=3, but at turn 78, what happens.\n\nTurn 78, if at y=3, freeway 3 at T=78.\n\nT=78, ΔT=1 for freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 second car: at ΔT=1, [-35+12, -24+12]=[-23,-12], all negative, 0 not covered. First car safe. So y=3 safe at T=78.\n\nSimilarly, if we go U to y=4 at turn 78, freeway 4 at T=78: as above, [12,47], safe.\n\nBut problem is turn 79.\n\nAt turn 78, we could be at different y.\n\nLet me denote the turn from t=77 onwards.\n\nTurn 77: must start at y=3.\n\nAction a_{77} determines y_{78}.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nWe need to choose actions to reach y=9 asap.\n\nSince min steps is 6, but with obstacles, might take more.\n\nBut perhaps we can go faster or slower.\n\nAnother idea: since at turn 79, y=1 and y=6 are safe, but y=1 is below, we are at y=3, going to y=1 might be away.\n\ny=6 is above.\n\nAt turn 77, we are at y=3.\n\nIf we go up to y=4 at turn 78.\n\nThen at turn 78, y=4, safe as above.\n\nNow turn 79, we need to go somewhere safe.\n\nIf we go up to y=5, but y=5 unsafe at T=79.\n\nGo down to y=3? But y=3 unsafe at T=79.\n\nGo down to y=4? But we are at y=4, if stay, y=4 at turn 79, unsafe.\n\nActions: from y=4 at turn 78, we can go U to y=5, D to y=3, or S stay y=4.\n\nBut all these positions are unsafe at turn 79: y=5, y=4, y=3 all have collision.\n\ny=2 also unsafe, y=1 is safe but too far.\n\nSo from y=4 at turn 78, we cannot go to any y=3,4,5 because all unsafe at turn 79.\n\nWe could go to y=6? But from y=4, to go to y=6, we need two steps up, but at turn 79, we can only reach y=5 if we go up from y=4.\n\ny_{79} = y_{78} + Δy, with Δy in {-1,0,1}, so from y=4, y_{79} can be 3,4, or 5, all unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=3,4,5 at turn 79.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 and y=1: y=1 is safe, but we are at y=4, to go to y=1 at turn 79, we need to go down three steps, but in one step from turn 78 to 79, we can only change by one, so from y=4 at turn 78, y_{79} can be 3,4,5 only.\n\nCannot reach y=1 or y=6 in one step.\n\nTherefore, if we are at y=4 at turn 78, we are forced to be at an unsafe position at turn 79, collision.\n\nThus, we cannot be at y=4 at turn 78.\n\nSimilarly, if we start by staying at y=3 at turn 78.\n\nTurn 77: at y=3, action S, so turn 78 at y=3.\n\nAt turn 78, y=3, freeway 3: ΔT=1, as above, safe.\n\nNow turn 79, from y=3, we can go to y=2,3,4.\n\nBut y=2,3,4 all unsafe at turn 79.\n\ny=2 has collision, y=3, y=4 all unsafe.\n\ny=1 is safe, but from y=3, to y=1, need two steps down, not possible in one step.\n\nSo again, stuck, must be unsafe at turn 79.\n\nIf at turn 77 we go down to y=2.\n\nTurn 77: action D, so y_{78} = 3-1=2.\n\nAt turn 78, y=2, freeway 2 at T=78.\n\nFreeway 2: at T=78, ΔT=1.\n\nFirst car: [13+12,24+12]=[25,36], safe.\n\nSecond car: [-35+12,-24+12]=[-23,-12], safe. So y=2 safe at T=78.\n\nThen turn 79, from y=2, we can go to y=1,2,3.\n\ny=1 at turn 79 is safe, as freeway 1 at ΔT=2, [1,48], safe.\n\ny=2 at turn 79 unsafe, y=3 unsafe.\n\nSo we can go to y=1 at turn 79.\n\nAction D from y=2 to y=1.\n\nThen at turn 79, y=1, safe.\n\nBut y=1 is low, and we need to go up to 9, which is far.\n\nMoreover, at later turns, y=1 might be safe for a while.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid the collision by not being on those rows at that turn.\n\nAnother option: at turn 77, go up to y=4, but we saw that leads to problem.\n\nOr go down to y=2, then to y=1 at turn 79.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut let's see the collision times again.\n\nAt turn 79, only y=2,3,4,5 are unsafe; y=1,6,7,8 are safe.\n\ny=6 is safe at T=79.\n\nBut from y=3 at turn 77, how to be at y=6 at turn 79.\n\nTurn 79 is two turns from now.\n\nAt turn 77, y=3.\n\nAfter one turn, turn 78, y can be 2,3,4.\n\nThen from there, turn 79, y can be from min y-1 to y+1.\n\nIf at turn 78 we are at y=4, then turn 79 y=3,4,5 all unsafe.\n\nIf at turn 78 we are at y=3, then turn 79 y=2,3,4 unsafe.\n\nIf at turn 78 we are at y=2, then turn 79 y=1,2,3; y=1 safe, y=2 and 3 unsafe.\n\nSo only possibility to be safe at turn 79 is to be at y=1, by going down to y=2 at turn 78, then down to y=1 at turn 79.\n\nOr, if we can be at y=6 at turn 79.\n\nBut from y=3 at turn 77, to y=6 at turn 79, that requires +3 in two steps, so must go up both times: to y=4 at turn 78, then to y=5 at turn 79, but y=5 unsafe, and we can't reach y=6 directly.\n\nFrom y=4 at turn 78, to y=5 at turn 79, not to y=6.\n\ny_{79} = y_{78} + Δy, so from y=4, y_{79} <=5.\n\nCannot reach y=6 from y=4 in one step.\n\nSimilarly, from y=3 at turn 78, y_{79} <=4.\n\nFrom y=2 at turn 78, y_{79} <=3.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=6 at turn 79 from start at y=3 in two steps.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 or 8 even farther.\n\nSo the only safe option at turn 79 is to be at y=1.\n\nThus, we must go down to y=2 at turn 78, then down to y=1 at turn 79.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nBut y=1 at turn 79 is safe.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=1, to y=9, min 8 steps, but may need to avoid other collisions.\n\nFirst, let's write the actions so far.\n\nTurn 77: at y=3, action D to go to y=2. (since we need to go down)\n\nAction a_t is at turn t, determines y_{t+1}? Let's see the player update.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nAnd a_t at turn t.\n\nSo at turn t, we perform action a_t, which determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at position (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nThe sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1+H-1, and after H actions, we are at y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nStart at turn t_1, position (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,3)\n\nAfter first action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k, position y_{t_1 + k}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9, so after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, we are at y=9.\n\nAnd H minimal.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1, total H actions.\n\nFor example, H=0, no action, but y=3 not 9, so H>0.\n\nNow back.\n\nSo to avoid collision at turn 79, we must be at y=1 at turn 79.\n\nTurn 79 is turn t_1 + 2, since t_1=77, turn 79 is t_1+2.\n\nAt turn t_1+2 =79, we want y_{79} =1.\n\nAt turn t_1=77, y=3.\n\nSo from turn 77 to turn 79, two actions.\n\ny_{78} = y_{77} + Δy_{77}\n\ny_{79} = y_{78} + Δy_{78}\n\nWe want y_{79} =1.\n\ny_{77} =3.\n\nSo y_{79} = y_{77} + Δy_{77} + Δy_{78} =3 + Δy_{77} + Δy_{78}\n\nSet equal to 1, so 3 + Δy_{77} + Δy_{78} =1, thus Δy_{77} + Δy_{78} = -2.\n\nSince each Δy in {-1,0,1}, possible only if both Δy = -1.\n\nSo action D at turn 77 and D at turn 78.\n\nThus: turn 77: action D, so y_{78} = 3-1=2\n\nTurn 78: action D, so y_{79} = 2-1=1\n\nAt turn 78, y=2, freeway 2, as before, safe at T=78.\n\nAt turn 79, y=1, freeway 1: at T=79, ΔT=2, [1,48], safe.\n\nNow, from here, we need to go up to y=9.\n\ny=1 at turn 79.\n\nNow, freeways above have collisions later.\n\nSpecifically, y=7 and y=8 have collisions from T=85 to 88.\n\nBut we might reach y=9 before that.\n\nMin steps from y=1 to y=9 is 8 steps: U each turn.\n\nSo if start at turn 79, y=1.\n\nAfter 8 U actions, at turn 79+8=87, y=1+8=9.\n\nBut need to check if during the path, we avoid collisions.\n\nNow, from turn 79 onwards.\n\ny_{79} =1\n\nThen y_{80} =1 + Δy_{79}, etc.\n\nWe need to be on freeways y=1 to 8 during the ascent.\n\nBut y=1 at turn 79 is safe.\n\nNow, when we move up, we will be on y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8 at subsequent turns.\n\nBut we need to avoid when those have collisions.\n\nFirst, list the turns we will be on each freeway if we go up directly.\n\nSuppose we go up every turn from turn 79.\n\nTurn 79: y=1\n\nTurn 80: y=2 (if U)\n\nTurn 81: y=3\n\nTurn 82: y=4\n\nTurn 83: y=5\n\nTurn 84: y=6\n\nTurn 85: y=7\n\nTurn 86: y=8\n\nTurn 87: y=9\n\nAt y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nNow, check for each, if collision when on that freeway.\n\nAt turn 79: y=1, freeway 1, safe as above.\n\nTurn 80: y=2, freeway 2 at T=80.\n\nT=80, ΔT=3 from t_1=77.\n\nFreeway 2: second car at ΔT=3, [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], all positive, 0 not covered? [1,12], 1<= x <=12, 0 not included, so safe. First car safe.\n\nSo y=2 safe at T=80.\n\nTurn 81: y=3, freeway 3 at T=81.\n\nΔT=4.\n\nFreeway 3 second car: [-35+48, -24+48]=[13,24], all positive, safe. First car safe. So safe.\n\nTurn 82: y=4, freeway 4 at T=82.\n\nΔT=5.\n\nFreeway 4: left-moving, [48-36*5, 83-36*5]=[48-180,83-180]=[-132,-97], all negative, safe. (since s=36, ΔT=5, 36*5=180)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 same.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTurn 83: y=5, freeway 5 at T=83.\n\nΔT=6, [48-216,83-216]=[-168,-133], all negative, safe.\n\nTurn 84: y=6, freeway 6 at T=84.\n\nΔT=7.\n\nFreeway 6: right-moving, [-11 +6*7, 0 +42]=[-11+42,42]=[31,42], all positive, safe.\n\nTurn 85: y=7, freeway 7 at T=85.\n\nΔT=8.\n\nFreeway 7 first car: covers at ΔT=8,9,10.\n\nAt ΔT=8, covered? Earlier: for freeway 7, first car covers when ΔT=8,9,10.\n\nAt ΔT=8, T=85, [-43 +4*8, -32 +4*8]=[-43+32, -32+32]=[-11,0], so -11<=0<=0, covered, collision.\n\nOh, so at turn 85, if on y=7, collision.\n\nSimilarly, in this path, at turn 85, y=7, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nWe can delay or something.\n\nAt turn 85, y=7 unsafe.\n\nNow, freeway 7 unsafe at T=85,86,87.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 unsafe at T=85,86,87,88.\n\nIn the direct up path, we hit y=7 at turn 85, which is unsafe.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=7 during T=85-87, or on y=8 during T=85-88.\n\nSince we are going up, we might be able to time it so that we pass y=7 before or after.\n\nFor example, if we reach y=7 earlier or later.\n\nBut from y=1 at turn 79, to reach y=7.\n\ny=7 is 6 levels up, so min 6 steps.\n\nIf we go up fast, at turn 79: y=1\n\nTurn 80: y=2\n\nTurn 81: y=3\n\nTurn 82: y=4\n\nTurn 83: y=5\n\nTurn 84: y=6\n\nTurn 85: y=7 → unsafe\n\nIf we go slower, we reach later, but T=86 and 87 also unsafe for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 unsafe until T=89.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe until T=88, so at T=89, safe? T=89, ΔT=12.\n\nFreeway 8: [-35+3*12, -24+3*12]=[-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], safe at ΔT=12.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at T=88: ΔT=11, freeway 7 first car: at ΔT=11, [-43+44, -32+44]=[1,12], safe.\n\nBut in our case, from turn 79, we start late.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 without hitting the unsafe times.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 are unsafe at certain times, but we can be on them at safe times.\n\nList the safe times for each freeway, or rather, the unsafe times to avoid.\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe at T=77,78\n\nBut we are past that, T=79 onwards, freeway 6 is safe for T>=79.\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at T=85,86,87\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=85,86,87,88\n\nFreeway 1-5: we are above or below, but since we are going up from y=1, and freeway 1-5 are safe after T=79 except for later times but no, freeway 1 only unsafe at T=78, past.\n\nFreeway 2 unsafe at T=79, past.\n\nSimilarly, all lower freeways safe after T=79.\n\nOnly y=7 and y=8 have unsafe periods later.\n\nNow, from y=1 at turn 79, we need to go up to y=9.\n\nThe unsafe periods for y=7 are turns 85,86,87.\n\nFor y=8, turns 85,86,87,88.\n\nWe need to be on y=7 at a turn not in {85,86,87}, similarly for y=8 not in {85,86,87,88}.\n\nAlso, we need to pass through each y.\n\nSince we move one step per turn, we will be on each y exactly one turn, unless we stay or move down, but to minimize time, probably no staying or down.\n\nAssume we go up as fast as possible.\n\nThen from y=1 at turn 79, we will be:\n\nTurn 79: y=1\n\nTurn 80: y=2\n\n...\n\nTurn 85: y=7\n\nTurn 86: y=8\n\nTurn 87: y=9\n\nBut at turn 85, y=7, unsafe.\n\nAt turn 86, y=8, unsafe.\n\nAt turn 87, y=9, safe.\n\nSo collisions at turn 85 and 86.\n\nTo avoid, we need to not be on y=7 at turn 85,86,87.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at 85-88.\n\nSince we must pass y=7 and y=8, we need to be on them at safe times.\n\nSafe times for y=7: all except 85,86,87. So before 85 or after 87.\n\nSimilarly for y=8: before 85 or after 88.\n\nAfter 87 for y=7: turn 88 or later.\n\nAfter 88 for y=8: turn 89 or later.\n\nBut we want to reach y=9 asap, so probably better to go earlier rather than later.\n\nIf we delay the ascent.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=1 for some turns, then go up.\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\nWe could go up but pause at some safe row.\n\nFor instance, at y=6, which is safe after T=78, so always safe from turn 79 onwards.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,4,etc safe.\n\ny=6 is safe.\n\nNow, from y=1 at turn 79, we can go up to y=6 quickly, then wait there until after the unsafe period, then go to y=7,8,9.\n\nBut waiting adds turns.\n\nSince y=7 unsafe from 85-87, we can be on y=7 at turn 84 or earlier, or turn 88 or later.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at turn 84 or earlier, or 89 or later.\n\nBut from turn 79, we are at y=1, so to reach y=7 early, say at turn 85 - something.\n\nTurn 79: y=1\n\nTo be at y=7 at turn 84, for example.\n\ny=7 at turn 84.\n\nFrom y=1 at turn 79 to y=7 at turn 84: difference in y is 6, difference in turns is 5 turns (turn 80 to 84?).\n\nFrom turn 79 to turn 84, that's 5 steps? Let's see the turn when we arrive.\n\nAt turn 79, position y=1.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 79 + k, position y=1 + sum Δy.\n\nTo be at y=7 at turn T.\n\nThen T - 79 = time from start, and y - 1 = net up moves.\n\nSince we can only move up, down, or stay, but to go up fast, assume all up except when waiting.\n\nMin turns to go from y=1 to y=7 is 6 turns: arrive at y=7 on turn 79 + 6 = 85.\n\nSimilarly, to arrive earlier, not possible since min 6 turns to go up 6 levels.\n\nFrom turn 79 y=1, after 0 actions, turn 79 y=1\n\nAfter 1 action, turn 80, y=2 if U\n\nAfter 2 actions, turn 81, y=3\n\n...\n\nAfter 6 actions, turn 85, y=7\n\nExactly at turn 85, which is unsafe.\n\nTo arrive later, say at turn 88, y=7.\n\nThen from turn 79 to turn 88, 9 turns to go from y=1 to y=7, but we can be at y=7 on turn 88.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can pass y=7 before turn 85.\n\nBut impossible, since min turn to be at y=7 is turn 85 if start from y=1 turn 79.\n\nTurn 79: y=1\n\nTurn 80: y=2\n\nTurn 81: y=3\n\nTurn 82: y=4\n\nTurn 83: y=5\n\nTurn 84: y=6\n\nTurn 85: y=7 → earliest possible, but unsafe.\n\nCannot be earlier.\n\nSimilarly, to be later, say at turn 88: y=7.\n\nBut from turn 79 to 88 is 9 turns, but we can arrive at y=7 on turn 88 by staying or going slower.\n\nFor example, stay at y=1 for 2 turns, then go up.\n\nThen: turn 79: y=1\n\nAction S, turn 80: y=1\n\nAction S, turn 81: y=1\n\nThen U, turn 82: y=2\n\nU, turn 83: y=3\n\nU, turn 84: y=4\n\nU, turn 85: y=5\n\nU, turn 86: y=6\n\nU, turn 87: y=7 → but turn 87 is unsafe for y=7.\n\nStill unsafe.\n\nIf we stay longer.\n\nTo be at y=7 at turn 88.\n\nTurn 88: y=7.\n\nFrom turn 79 y=1, need to increase y by 6 in 9 turns (from turn 80 to 88, 8 actions?).\n\nAt turn 79, after 0 actions.\n\nAfter 1 action, turn 80\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, turn 79+k\n\nSet turn 79+k =88, so k=9, turn 88.\n\ny=1 + net up.\n\nTo have y=7 at turn 88, net up must be 6, so in 9 actions, we need 6 U, and 3 S or D, but D not good, so 3 S.\n\nSimilarly, we can be at y=7 at turn 88 with 6 U and 3 S in some order.\n\nThen at turn 88, y=7, which is safe since T=88, ΔT=11, freeway 7 safe as above.\n\nThen from there, go to y=8 and y=9.\n\nBut y=8 at turn 89 or later.\n\nFirst, let's see the path.\n\nBut this might take many turns.\n\nWe can go up to y=6 quickly, then wait at y=6 until safe to go to y=7.\n\ny=6 is always safe after T=78.\n\nFreeway 6 safe for T>=79.\n\nSo from turn 79, y=1.\n\nGo up to y=6 in 5 steps: turn 80: y=2, turn 81: y=3, turn 82: y=4, turn 83: y=5, turn 84: y=6.\n\nThen at turn 84, y=6, safe.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=7, but y=7 unsafe at T=85,86,87.\n\nSo we can stay at y=6 for some turns.\n\nUntil T=88, when y=7 is safe.\n\nAt turn 84, y=6.\n\nIf we stay, turn 85: y=6, safe (freeway 6 at T=85: ΔT=8, [-11+48,48]=[37,48], safe)\n\nTurn 86: y=6, safe\n\nTurn 87: y=6, safe\n\nThen at turn 87, we can go to y=7? But turn 87, if we go U to y=7, at turn 88 position y=7.\n\nTurn when we are on y=7.\n\nAction at turn t, y_{t+1} determined.\n\nAt turn 87, if we are at y=6, and action U, then at turn 88, y=7.\n\nTurn 88: T=88, freeway 7: ΔT=11, safe as above.\n\nThen from there, to y=8 and y=9.\n\nAt turn 88, y=7.\n\nAction U, turn 89: y=8\n\nNow, freeway 8 at T=89: ΔT=12, [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], safe.\n\nThen action U, turn 90: y=9, done.\n\nBut we have many turns.\n\nIn this case, we stayed at y=6 from turn 84 to 87, that's 4 turns at y=6? Turn 84: y=6\n\nIf no action? At turn 84, we are at y=6.\n\nThen action at turn 84: if S, then turn 85: y=6\n\nAction at turn 85: S, turn 86: y=6\n\nAction at turn 86: S, turn 87: y=6\n\nThen action at turn 87: U, then turn 88: y=7\n\nAction at turn 88: U, turn 89: y=8\n\nAction at turn 89: U, turn 90: y=9\n\nSo reached at turn 90.\n\nTotal turns from start: from turn 77.\n\nFirst, to get to turn 79 y=1: actions at turn 77 and 78: both D, so y_78=2, y_79=1.\n\nThen from turn 79 to turn 90: that's 11 turns? Let's list the sequence.\n\nStart: turn 77: position y=3\n\nAction a77: D, so turn 78: y=2\n\nAction a78: D, turn 79: y=1\n\nNow from turn 79: y=1\n\nAction a79: U, turn 80: y=2\n\na80: U, turn 81: y=3\n\na81: U, turn 82: y=4\n\na82: U, turn 83: y=5\n\na83: U, turn 84: y=6\n\nNow at turn 84, y=6\n\nAction a84: S, turn 85: y=6\n\na85: S, turn 86: y=6\n\na86: S, turn 87: y=6\n\na87: U, turn 88: y=7\n\na88: U, turn 89: y=8\n\na89: U, turn 90: y=9\n\nSo at turn 90, y=9.\n\nTotal actions from t=77 to t=89, that's 13 actions? Turns: actions at t=77 to t=89 inclusive, that's 13 actions, H=13.\n\nBut we reached at turn 90.\n\nt_1=77, after H actions, at turn t_1 + H.\n\nHere, after 13 actions, at turn 77+13=90.\n\nBut we might do better.\n\nInstead of waiting at y=6, we could go to y=7 later but from a different point.\n\nAnother idea: since y=8 is unsafe until T=88, we can be on y=8 at T=89 or later.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at T=88 or later.\n\nBut we need to be on both.\n\nFrom y=1, we can go up to y=6, then directly to y=7 at a safe time.\n\nBut y=7 safe after T=87, so T=88 or later.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nMin time to y=9: if we go directly without waiting, we reach y=9 at turn 87: from turn 79 y=1, after 8 U, turn 87 y=9, but on the way, at turn 85 y=7 unsafe.\n\nBut at turn 87, y=9 safe, but we were on y=7 at turn 85 and y=8 at turn 86, both unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, we need to not be on y=7 at 85,86,87.\n\nSince we must be on y=7 at some turn, it has to be at turn 84 or earlier, or turn 88 or later.\n\nTurn 84 or earlier: from y=1 at turn 79, cannot reach y=7 before turn 85.\n\nSo only option turn 88 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, must be at turn 89 or later to be safe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to be on y=8 at some turn, then to y=9.\n\nIf we are at y=8 at turn T, then at turn T+1, y=9.\n\ny=8 must be safe at turn T, so T not in 85-88, so T>=89.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at T>=89, we need to have come from y=7 at turn T-1 or from below.\n\nBut y=7 must be safe at turn T-1.\n\nIf T=89, y=8 at turn 89, safe.\n\nThen y=7 at turn 88 or turn 89? When we move to y=8.\n\nIf at turn T-1, we are at y=7, and action U, then at turn T, y=8.\n\nSo at turn T-1, y=7 must be safe.\n\nFor T=89, y=8 at turn 89, so at turn 88, we must be at y=7 and action U.\n\nThen at turn 88, y=7 must be safe, which it is at T=88.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo sequence: at turn 88: y=7, safe\n\nAction U, turn 89: y=8, safe\n\nAction U, turn 90: y=9\n\nNow, we need to be at y=7 at turn 88.\n\nFrom y=1 at turn 79, to y=7 at turn 88.\n\nThat's 9 turns later? From turn 79 to turn 88.\n\nAt turn 79: y=1\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 79 + k\n\nSet turn 79 + k = 88, so k=9, turn 88.\n\ny=1 + net up, want y=7, so net up=6.\n\nSo in 9 actions, 6 U and 3 S.\n\nSimilarly, to minimize time, we can do the U as early as possible, but with the S to delay.\n\nBut we need to be safe during the path.\n\nNow, from turn 79 to 88, we will be on intermediate rows.\n\nBut all rows except y=7 and y=8 are safe for T>=79, as long as we avoid their unsafe times, but y=1 to 6 have no unsafe times after T=79, only y=7 and 8 have later unsafe times.\n\ny=7 unsafe only at 85,86,87, so at turn 88 safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at 89 safe.\n\nDuring the ascent from y=1 to y=7, we are on y=2 to 6, which are safe for all turns after T=79.\n\nSo we can go up to y=6 quickly, then stay at y=6 until turn 87, then go to y=7 at turn 88.\n\nThen to y=8 and 9.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAt turn 79: y=1\n\nGo up to y=6 in 5 steps:\n\na79: U, turn 80: y=2\n\na80: U, turn 81: y=3\n\na81: U, turn 82: y=4\n\na82: U, turn 83: y=5\n\na83: U, turn 84: y=6\n\nNow at turn 84, y=6\n\nWe need to be at y=7 at turn 88.\n\nSo from turn 84 to turn 88, that's 4 turns: turn 84,85,86,87.\n\nAt turn 84, y=6.\n\nAfter m actions, at turn 84 + m\n\nSet turn 84 + m = 88, so m=4, turn 88.\n\ny=6 + net up, want y=7, so net up=1.\n\nThus in 4 actions, one U and three S.\n\nSo we can stay at y=6 for three turns, then go up.\n\na84: S, turn 85: y=6\n\na85: S, turn 86: y=6\n\na86: S, turn 87: y=6\n\na87: U, turn 88: y=7\n\nThen a88: U, turn 89: y=8\n\na89: U, turn 90: y=9\n\nSame as before, 13 actions total.\n\nBut earlier we have the initial two down actions.\n\nNow, total from turn 77: actions at t=77 to t=89, 13 actions, reach at turn 90.\n\nBut we might reduce by not staying so long.\n\nAnother idea: since we need to be at y=7 at turn 88, but we can reach y=7 earlier and wait, but y=7 unsafe at 85-87, so we cannot be on y=7 during those turns, so we must be below or above.\n\nBut above not possible, so below, like at y=6.\n\nSo we have to wait at y=6 or lower.\n\nBut y=6 is the highest safe row to wait.\n\nSo min waiting is to arrive at y=6 as early as possible, then wait until turn 87, then go to y=7 at turn 88.\n\nIn the above, we arrived at y=6 at turn 84, and waited until turn 87, that's three stays, then to y=9 at turn 90.\n\nCan we arrive at y=6 earlier?\n\nFrom y=1 at turn 79, we arrived at y=6 at turn 84, which is the earliest, since 5 steps up.\n\nTurn 79: y=1, after 5 U, turn 84 y=6.\n\nCannot earlier.\n\nPerhaps from the beginning, we don't go down to y=1, but find another way.\n\nBut earlier we had to go to y=1 to avoid turn 79 collision.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is another safe row at turn 79.\n\nAt turn 79, safe rows are y=1,6,7,8.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are safe at turn 79, but we cannot reach them from y=3 in two steps.\n\nOnly y=1 is reachable.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=6 at turn 79.\n\nBut from y=3 at turn 77, to y=6 at turn 79.\n\ny=6 at turn 79 is safe.\n\nBut can we reach it?\n\nFrom turn 77 y=3 to turn 79 y=6.\n\ny_{79} = y_{77} + Δy_{77} + Δy_{78} =3 + Δy77 + Δy78\n\nSet to 6, so Δy77 + Δy78 =3, so both U, or one U and one S but 3, so must both U.\n\nThen y78 =3 +1=4 (if a77=U)\n\nThen y79=4 +1=5 if a78=U, but y=5 at turn 79, which is unsafe.\n\ny=5 at turn 79 collision.\n\nIf we go U at turn 77 to y=4 at turn 78.\n\nThen at turn 78, y=4, safe.\n\nThen if we go U to y=5 at turn 79, unsafe.\n\nOr other actions, to y=3,4,5, all unsafe at turn 79.\n\nCannot reach y=6.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=6 at turn 79 from start.\n\nThus, only possibility is to be at y=1 at turn 79.\n\nSo we have to do the down actions.\n\nNow, back to minimizing the ascent.\n\nIn the waiting, we have three stays at y=6.\n\nBut total actions: from turn 77 to turn 89, 13 actions.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach y=9 faster by not waiting so long.\n\nFor example, if we go to y=7 at turn 88, but we can go directly to y=8 from y=7 at a safe time, but y=8 needs to be at T>=89.\n\nAt turn 88, y=7 safe, then to y=8 at turn 89 safe.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at turn 88, we need to be at y=6 or lower at turn 87.\n\nIf we are at y=6 at turn 87, then U to y=7 at turn 88.\n\nBut at turn 87, if at y=6, safe, then U to y=7 at turn 88.\n\nNow, how to be at y=6 at turn 87.\n\nFrom y=1 at turn 79, to y=6 at turn 87.\n\nTurn 87 is turn t_1 +10, since t_1=77, turn 87 is 10 turns later.\n\nAt turn 79, after k actions, turn 79+k.\n\nSet to 87, k=8.\n\ny=1 + net up, want y=6, net up=5.\n\nSo in 8 actions, 5 U and 3 S.\n\nThen at turn 87, y=6.\n\nThen a87: U, turn 88: y=7\n\na88: U, turn 89: y=8\n\na89: U, turn 90: y=9\n\nStill reach at turn 90.\n\nBut we spent more time below, but same end turn.\n\nTo be at y=6 earlier, but then we have to wait longer at y=6.\n\nFor example, if we go to y=6 at turn 84, then we need to stay until turn 87 to go to y=7 at turn 88.\n\nIf we go to y=6 later, say turn 86, then we can go to y=7 at turn 88 with less waiting.\n\nFor example, from y=1 at turn 79.\n\nGo up slowly.\n\nSuppose we stay at y=1 for two turns: a79: S, turn 80: y=1\n\na80: S, turn 81: y=1\n\nThen U to y=2 at turn 82\n\nU to y=3 at turn 83\n\nU to y=4 at turn 84\n\nU to y=5 at turn 85\n\nU to y=6 at turn 86\n\nAt turn 86, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at turn 86, we are at y=6.\n\nNow, to go to y=7 at turn 88.\n\nFrom turn 86 to turn 88.\n\nAt turn 86: y=6\n\nAfter m actions, turn 86 + m\n\nSet to 88, m=2, turn 88.\n\ny=6 + net up, want y=7, net up=1.\n\nSo in two actions, one U and one S.\n\nFor example, a86: S, turn 87: y=6\n\na87: U, turn 88: y=7\n\nThen a88: U, turn 89: y=8\n\na89: U, turn 90: y=9\n\nSame as before.\n\na86: U, turn 87: y=7, but at turn 87, y=7, T=87, unsafe, collision.\n\nCannot, so must stay at turn 86 or go down, but not efficient.\n\nSo only way is to be at y=6 at turn 87, then U to y=7 at turn 88.\n\nIn all cases, we reach y=9 at turn 90.\n\nWith actions from t=77 to t=89.\n\nBut let's count the turns from start.\n\nt_1=77\n\nAfter initial: a77: D, turn 78: y=2\n\na78: D, turn 79: y=1\n\nThen from turn 79, we need to reach y=9 by some path with min steps but avoiding unsafe.\n\nThe fastest to y=9 from y=1 is 8 steps, but with collision, so we add 3 waits, total 11 steps from turn 79, reach turn 90.\n\n11 actions from turn 79 to 89, plus the two down actions, total 13 actions.\n\nBut perhaps we can reduce the waiting by one.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=7 at turn 88, but go to y=8 at turn 89, which is safe, then to y=9 at turn 90.\n\nBut y=8 at turn 89 safe.\n\nBut we need to be at y=7 at turn 88.\n\nNow, the unsafe period for y=7 ends at turn 87, so turn 88 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8, turn 89 safe.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at turn 88, we need to come from y=6 at turn 87 or y=7 at turn 87 but if at y=7 turn 87, unsafe, so must be from y=6 at turn 87.\n\nAt turn 87, y=6, safe, then U to y=7 at turn 88.\n\nSo we must be at y=6 at turn 87.\n\nHow to be at y=6 at turn 87 from y=1 at turn 79.\n\nTurn 87 - turn 79 = 8 turns, so after 8 actions, at turn 87.\n\ny=1 to y=6, net up 5.\n\nSo in 8 actions, 5 U and 3 S.\n\nThe S can be at any point, but to be safe, since all rows below y=7 are safe, we can have the S at the beginning or end.\n\nFor example, a79: U, turn 80: y=2\n\na80: U, turn 81: y=3\n\na81: U, turn 82: y=4\n\na82: S, turn 83: y=4\n\na83: U, turn 84: y=5\n\na84: U, turn 85: y=6\n\na85: S, turn 86: y=6\n\na86: S, turn 87: y=6\n\nThen a87: U, turn 88: y=7\n\na88: U, turn 89: y=8\n\na89: U, turn 90: y=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf we put the S earlier, but still, we need three S.\n\nNet up 5 in 8 actions, so 3 S.\n\nNo way around.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 in fewer than 11 actions from turn 79.\n\nFor example, if we go up to y=8 at a safe time.\n\nBut y=8 safe at turn 89 or later.\n\nIf at turn 89 y=8, then to y=9 at turn 90.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at turn 89, need to be at y=7 at turn 88 or below.\n\nBut y=7 at turn 88 safe.\n\nSo same as before.\n\nIf we can be at y=8 at turn 84 or earlier, but from y=1 at turn 79, min turn to y=8 is turn 87: turn 79 y=1, 80 y=2, 81 y=3, 82 y=4, 83 y=5, 84 y=6, 85 y=7, 86 y=8, but at turn 85 y=7 unsafe, and turn 86 y=8 unsafe.\n\nTurn 86 y=8, T=86, freeway 8 unsafe.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nThus, the minimal is to reach at turn 90 with 13 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the total H.\n\nActions from t=77 to t=89 inclusive, that's 13 actions: t=77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89.\n\nAt turn 90, y=9.\n\nNow, is there a way with less?\n\nPerhaps at the beginning, instead of going down to y=1, we can go up to y=4 at turn 78, then at turn 79, instead of being on y=3,4,5, we can be on y=6 if possible, but impossible.\n\nOr, at turn 78, from y=4, we go down to y=3, but y=3 unsafe at turn 79.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother idea: since at turn 79, y=6 is safe, and we are at y=3 at turn 77, if we can be at y=6 at turn 79, but as before, not possible.\n\nPerhaps with a different sequence.\n\nSuppose at turn 77, we go up to y=4.\n\nThen at turn 78, y=4, safe.\n\nThen at turn 78, instead of moving, we stay or something, but at turn 79, we must move to y=3,4,5, all unsafe.\n\nUnless we can jump to y=6, but no.\n\nSo I think it's impossible to avoid the turn 79 collision without going down to y=1.\n\nThus, the only way is to go down and then up with waiting.\n\nBut in the waiting, we have three S at y=6.\n\nBut total turns 13.\n\nPerhaps we can have less waiting by going to a different row.\n\nFor example, at turn 79, we are at y=1, we can go up to y=5 or y=6, but y=5 is safe after T=79, but when we are on it.\n\nBut in the path to y=6, we pass y=5, which is safe.\n\nBut the issue is only at y=7 and y=8 later.\n\ny=7 and y=8 require us to be there after the unsafe period.\n\nSince the unsafe period is fixed, and we start from low, we have to delay.\n\nPerhaps we can go down further, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo I think 13 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can save one turn.\n\nSuppose we go to y=7 at turn 88, but from y=1, to be at y=7 at turn 88, we need 6 up in 9 actions from turn 79, with 3 S.\n\nThen to y=8 at turn 89, y=9 at turn 90.\n\nSame.\n\nIf we can be at y=8 at turn 89 directly from below, but we need to be at y=7 at turn 88.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think H=13 is the minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence.\n\nFrom above:\n\nTurn 77: action D (to y=2 at turn 78)\n\nTurn 78: action D (to y=1 at turn 79)\n\nThen turn 79: action U (to y=2 at turn 80)\n\nTurn 80: U (y=3 at turn 81)\n\nTurn 81: U (y=4 at turn 82)\n\nTurn 82: U (y=5 at turn 83)\n\nTurn 83: U (y=6 at turn 84)\n\nTurn 84: S (stay y=6 at turn 85)\n\nTurn 85: S (y=6 at turn 86)\n\nTurn 86: S (y=6 at turn 87)\n\nTurn 87: U (y=7 at turn 88)\n\nTurn 88: U (y=8 at turn 89)\n\nTurn 89: U (y=9 at turn 90)\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=77 to t=89.\n\nAt turn 89, action U, to y=9 at turn 90.\n\nNow, we need to make sure all positions are safe.\n\nAt turn 78: y=2, freeway 2 at T=78, safe as before.\n\nTurn 79: y=1, freeway 1 at T=79, safe.\n\nTurn 80: y=2, freeway 2 at T=80, safe.\n\nTurn 81: y=3, freeway 3 at T=81, safe.\n\nTurn 82: y=4, freeway 4 at T=82, safe.\n\nTurn 83: y=5, freeway 5 at T=83, safe.\n\nTurn 84: y=6, freeway 6 at T=84, safe.\n\nTurn 85: y=6, freeway 6 at T=85, safe.\n\nTurn 86: y=6, freeway 6 at T=86, safe.\n\nTurn 87: y=6, freeway 6 at T=87, safe.\n\nTurn 88: y=7, freeway 7 at T=88, ΔT=11, safe.\n\nTurn 89: y=8, freeway 8 at T=89, ΔT=12, safe.\n\nThen turn 90: y=9, no freeway.\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, the actions are for turns t=77 to 89.\n\nIn the answer, it should be the sequence of actions.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, which is 13.\n\nBut let's see if we can reduce.\n\nNotice that at turn 79, we are at y=1, and we go up immediately.\n\nBut in the waiting, we have three S at y=6.\n\nBut we can have one of the S earlier, for example, stay at y=1 or lower, but y=1 is safe, but staying there doesn't help, since we need to go up eventually.\n\nFor example, at turn 79, we stay at y=1: a79: S, turn 80: y=1\n\nThen a80: U, etc., but then we arrive at y=6 later, and still need to wait, but the end turn might be the same or later.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=1 at turn 79, then we need to reach y=7 at turn 88, which might require more S.\n\nBut not better.\n\nSo I think 13 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 in 12 actions, but I don't see how.\n\nFor example, if we reach y=9 at turn 89.\n\nThen at turn 89, y=9.\n\nFrom y=1 at turn 79, after 10 actions, turn 89.\n\ny=1 + net up =9, net up=8.\n\nIn 10 actions, 8 U and 2 S.\n\nThen we can be at y=9 at turn 89.\n\nBut during the path, we need to be on y=7 and y=8 at safe times.\n\ny=7 must be at turn <=84 or >=88.\n\nIf >=88, turn 88 or later.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at turn >=89.\n\nNow, to be at y=9 at turn 89, we must be at y=8 at turn 88 or y=9 at turn 88, but y=9 at turn 88 not possible since from y=8.\n\nAt turn 88, we must be at y=8 or y=7 or y=9, but y=9 only if from above, not possible.\n\nSo at turn 88, we are at some y, then action to y_{89}.\n\nIf y_{89}=9, then at turn 88, y_{88} must be 8 or 9, but y=9 not, so y_{88}=8, and action U to y=9.\n\nThen at turn 88, y=8 must be safe.\n\nBut y=8 unsafe until T=88, so at T=88, unsafe.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at T=88, which is turn 88.\n\nSo at turn 88, if on y=8, collision.\n\nTherefore, cannot be on y=8 at turn 88.\n\nThus, cannot have y_{89}=9 with y_{88}=8.\n\nIf y_{88}=9, but impossible to reach from below in one step.\n\nThus, the earliest to reach y=9 is turn 90, with y=8 at turn 89 safe.\n\nSo minimal H=13.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, to write in the format.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=77.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 77: a_{77} = D\n\nTurn 78: a_{78} = D\n\nTurn 79: a_{79} = U\n\nTurn 80: a_{80} = U\n\nTurn 81: a_{81} = U\n\nTurn 82: a_{82} = U\n\nTurn 83: a_{83} = U\n\nTurn 84: a_{84} = S\n\nTurn 85: a_{85} = S\n\nTurn 86: a_{86} = S\n\nTurn 87: a_{87} = U\n\nTurn 88: a_{88} = U\n\nTurn 89: a_{89} = U\n\nAfter these 13 actions, at turn 90, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be up to turn t_1 + H -1 =77+13-1=89.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the answer, we need to box it.\n\nBut let's write the turns.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 6 has a car at (0,-11,right,6), which at T=77 and 78 covers 0, but we are not on it, and later not.\n\nAll covered.\n\nSo I think this is the solution.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 77\\) is 13. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by moving down to \\(y = 1\\) by turn 79 to avoid the collision at turn 79 on freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\), then moving up to \\(y = 6\\) by turn 84, waiting at \\(y = 6\\) until turn 87 to avoid the unsafe periods for freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) (turns 85–87 for \\(y = 7\\) and turns 85–88 for \\(y = 8\\)), and finally moving up to \\(y = 9\\) by turn 90.\n\nThe actions are as follows:\n\n- **Turn 77**: Action \\(D\\) (move down to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 78). Freeway \\(y = 3\\) is safe at turn 77.\n- **Turn 78**: Action \\(D\\) (move down to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 79). Freeway \\(y = 2\\) is safe at turn 78.\n- **Turn 79**: Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 80). Freeway \\(y = 1\\) is safe at turn 79.\n- **Turn 80**: Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 81). Freeway \\(y = 2\\) is safe at turn 80.\n- **Turn 81**: Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 82). Freeway \\(y = 3\\) is safe at turn 81.\n- **Turn 82**: Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 83). Freeway \\(y = 4\\) is safe at turn 82.\n- **Turn 83**: Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 84). Freeway \\(y = 5\\) is safe at turn 83.\n- **Turn 84**: Action \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 85). Freeway \\(y = 6\\) is safe at turn 84.\n- **Turn 85**: Action \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 86). Freeway \\(y = 6\\) is safe at turn 85.\n- **Turn 86**: Action \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 87). Freeway \\(y = 6\\) is safe at turn 86.\n- **Turn 87**: Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 88). Freeway \\(y = 6\\) is safe at turn 87.\n- **Turn 88**: Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 89). Freeway \\(y = 7\\) is safe at turn 88.\n- **Turn 89**: Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 90). Freeway \\(y = 8\\) is safe at turn 89.\n\nAt turn 90, \\(y = 9\\) is reached, and there are no cars on \\(y = 9\\), so it is safe.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 79, and I start at y=0. I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, but I have to stay within y=0 to y=9.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T where there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes linearly with time based on speed and direction.\n\nImportantly, when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at T+1 I'm on y+1. So I only check for collision on the row I'm currently on at each turn.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 quickly without colliding.\n\nFirst, I should figure out where the cars are at each turn relative to t₁=79.\n\nLet τ = T - t₁, so at τ=0, it's turn t₁.\n\nFor each freeway and each car, I can compute the span at time τ.\n\nSince collision depends on whether 0 is in the span at the exact turn, I need to see for each turn and each row I might be on, if there's a car that covers x=0 at that time.\n\nBut since I'm always at x=0, and cars are moving, I just care if any car on that row has span containing 0 at that turn.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so it's moving right, meaning the head is to the right? Let's see the span update.\n\nFor left-moving: span at t₁ [h, τ] becomes [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)] at T.\n\nFor right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]? Let's read carefully.\n\nIt says: for left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nBut [h, τ] with h and τ, and it moves left, so decreasing x.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\"\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, span at t₁ is [τ, h] = [-95, -48]? Let's see the notation.\n\nIt says: for car k, (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nThen for right-moving, it says Span(t₁) = [τ, h]\n\nIn this case, h = -48, τ = -95, d=right, so Span(t₁) = [τ, h] = [-95, -48]\n\nThen at time T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] = [-95 + 48(T-t₁), -48 + 48(T-t₁)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, Span(t₁) = [h, τ] and moves to [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nNow, collision if 0 is in Span(T) for some car on freeway y at turn T.\n\nAlso, note that multiple cars per freeway, so I need to check all cars on that row.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and their span at time τ = T - t₁.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nCars: only one, (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nSo at τ, span = [-95 + 48τ, -48 + 48τ] since right-moving.\n\nSet x_low(τ) = -95 + 48τ\n\nx_high(τ) = -48 + 48τ\n\n0 is in span if x_low(τ) ≤ 0 ≤ x_high(τ)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2\n\nCars: (48, 37, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head h=48, tail τ=37, direction right, speed 12\n\nFor right-moving, span at t₁: [τ, h] = [37, 48]\n\nAt τ: [37 + 12τ, 48 + 12τ]\n\nSecond car: (0, -11, right, 12), span at t₁: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt τ: [-11 + 12τ, 0 + 12τ] = [-11 + 12τ, 12τ]\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3\n\nCars: same as freeway 2? (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nIdentical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: y=4\n\nCars: (48,83,left,36)\n\nDirection left, so left-moving.\n\nHead h=48, tail τ=83? Span at t₁: for left-moving, [h, τ] = [48, 83]\n\nAt τ: [h - sτ, τ - sτ] = [48 - 36τ, 83 - 36τ]\n\nBut since it's left-moving, and h=48, τ=83, if head is smaller or larger? In the notation, [h, τ] with h and τ, but for left-moving, it might be that h is the front when moving left, so lower x? Let's see.\n\nIn the update, for left-moving: [h, τ] → [h - sτ, τ - sτ], so if it moves left, both decrease.\n\nIn this case, h=48, τ=83, so at t₁, span [48,83], which means from 48 to 83, so head at 48, tail at 83? But moving left, so head should be the leading part.\n\nPerhaps the head is always the front, tail is the back.\n\nIn the car state, it's (head, tail, dir, speed), and for direction, head is the front.\n\nFor right-moving, front is higher x, so head > tail.\n\nFor left-moving, front is lower x, so head < tail.\n\nIn freeway 4: (48,83,left,36), head=48, tail=83, since left-moving, head=48 < tail=83, so front is at 48, back at 83.\n\nSpan [48,83] at t₁.\n\nThen at τ, [48 - 36τ, 83 - 36τ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: y=5, same as freeway 4: (48,83,left,36), identical.\n\nFreeway 6: y=6, (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nRight-moving, head h=-48, tail τ=-59, so span at t₁: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt τ: [-59 + 6τ, -48 + 6τ]\n\nFreeway 7: y=7, (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4)\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4), span at t₁: [τ,h] = [37,48], at τ: [37 + 4τ, 48 + 4τ]\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,4), span at t₁: [-11,0], at τ: [-11 + 4τ, 4τ]\n\nFreeway 8: y=8, (-48,-59,right,3)\n\nRight-moving, head h=-48, tail τ=-59, span at t₁: [-59, -48], at τ: [-59 + 3τ, -48 + 3τ]\n\nNow, I start at y=0 at τ=0. I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, since cars only on y=1 to 8.\n\nAt y=0, I'm safe, and at y=9, I need to be there.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 9, since I need to move up 9 rows, but I can move up multiple times, but each U moves me up one, so minimum turns is 9 if I can go straight up without collision.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down sometimes to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's see for each row and each time if there is a car covering x=0.\n\nFor each freeway k, and time τ, we can find if there is a car such that 0 is in span.\n\nFor freeway 1: y=1\n\nCar: span [ -95 + 48τ, -48 + 48τ ]\n\n0 in span if -95 + 48τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 48τ\n\nWhich is 48τ ≤ 48 and 48τ ≥ 95? Let's solve.\n\n-95 + 48τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 48τ ≤ 95 ⇒ τ ≤ 95/48 ≈ 1.979\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -48 + 48τ ⇒ 48τ ≥ 48 ⇒ τ ≥ 1\n\nSo for τ between 1 and 95/48 ≈1.979, so at τ=1, let's check.\n\nAt τ=1: x_low = -95+48= -47, x_high= -48+48=0\n\n-47 to 0, so 0 is included? x_high=0, so 0 is the upper bound.\n\nI think [x_low, x_high] includes endpoints, so 0 is in [-47,0], yes.\n\nAt τ=1: -95+48(1) = -47, -48+48=0, so [ -47, 0], 0 is included.\n\nAt τ=2: -95+96=1, -48+96=48, [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nBut τ=2 is after, but τ=1 is covered.\n\nτ starts from 0.\n\nAt τ=0: span [-95, -48], 0 not in.\n\nτ=1: [-47,0], 0 in.\n\nτ=2: [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo for y=1, collision at τ=1 only.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2\n\nTwo cars.\n\nFirst car: [37 + 12τ, 48 + 12τ]\n\n0 in this span? 37+12τ ≤ 0 ≤ 48+12τ\n\nBut 37+12τ ≥37>0 for τ≥0, so 0 ≤ 37+12τ is false since left side negative or zero, but 37+12τ positive, so 0 < 37+12τ, so 0 not ≤ lower bound? Lower bound is 37+12τ >0, so 0 cannot be ≥ lower bound and ≤ upper bound since lower bound >0.\n\nSimilarly, upper bound >0.\n\nSo first car never covers x=0.\n\nSecond car: [-11 + 12τ, 12τ]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 12τ ≤ 0 ≤ 12τ\n\nWhich is 12τ ≤ 11? And 12τ ≥0, always for τ≥0.\n\n-11 + 12τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 12τ ≤ 11 ⇒ τ ≤ 11/12 ≈ 0.916\n\nAnd 0 ≤ 12τ ⇒ τ ≥ 0\n\nSo for τ=0, let's see.\n\nAt τ=0: [-11, 0], so 0 is included.\n\nτ=1: [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at τ=0, 0 is covered by second car.\n\nBut τ=0 is current time, turn t₁.\n\nNow, at turn T, if I am on freeway y at time T, I collide if 0 in span.\n\nBut at τ=0, I am at y=0, not on freeway 2, so no collision.\n\nFor future turns, when I might be on y=2 at some τ.\n\nAt τ=0, for y=2, there is a car covering x=0, but I am not on y=2 at τ=0, so it's fine.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=2 when τ=0? τ=0 is now, and I'm at y=0.\n\nFor freeway 2, collision at τ=0 only? From above, second car covers at τ=0.\n\nBut τ=0 is only at turn t₁, and I'm not on y=2 then.\n\nFor τ>0, no collision on y=2 from second car, and first car never covers.\n\nAt τ=0: second car span [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nFor τ=1: [1,12], not include 0.\n\nSo only at τ=0, y=2 has a car at x=0.\n\nBut since I am not on y=2 at τ=0, it's ok. If I were to be on y=2 at τ=0, I would collide, but I'm not.\n\nSimilarly, for other times, no issue on y=2.\n\nFreeway 3 is same as freeway 2, so identical: only at τ=0, collision possible but not relevant since I'm not there.\n\nNow freeway 4: y=4\n\nCar: left-moving, (48,83,left,36)\n\nSpan at τ: [48 - 36τ, 83 - 36τ]\n\n0 in span if 48 - 36τ ≤ 0 ≤ 83 - 36τ\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 36τ ≥ 48 ⇒ τ ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 83 - 36τ ⇒ 36τ ≤ 83 ⇒ τ ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSo for τ from 4/3 to 83/36, approximately 1.333 to 2.305, so τ=2? τ must be integer since turns are discrete.\n\nτ is integer, T - t₁, so turns are discrete, τ=0,1,2,...\n\nτ=1: 48-36=12, 83-36=47, [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nτ=2: 48-72= -24, 83-72=11, [-24,11], 0 is in since -24 ≤ 0 ≤11.\n\nτ=3: 48-108= -60, 83-108= -25, [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo at τ=2, collision possible on y=4.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 5, same as y=4, so at τ=2, collision on y=5.\n\nNow freeway 6: y=6\n\nCar: (-48,-59,right,6) right-moving.\n\nSpan at τ: [-59 + 6τ, -48 + 6τ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 6τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 6τ\n\nFirst: -59 + 6τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 6τ ≤ 59 ⇒ τ ≤ 59/6 ≈ 9.833\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 6τ ⇒ 6τ ≥ 48 ⇒ τ ≥ 8\n\nSo τ from 8 to 9.833, so τ=8,9.\n\nAt τ=8: -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nτ=9: -59+54= -5, -48+54=6, [-5,6], 0 included? -5≤0≤6 yes.\n\nτ=10: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], not include 0.\n\nSo collision at τ=8 and τ=9 on y=6.\n\nFreeway 7: y=7\n\nCars: (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4)\n\nFirst car: [37 + 4τ, 48 + 4τ], lower bound min 37>0, so never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: [-11 + 4τ, 4τ]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 4τ ≤ 0 ≤ 4τ\n\nFirst: -11 + 4τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 4τ ≤ 11 ⇒ τ ≤ 11/4 = 2.75\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 4τ ⇒ τ ≥ 0\n\nSo for τ=0,1,2\n\nτ=0: [-11,0], 0 in\n\nτ=1: [-11+4,4] = [-7,4], 0 in? -7≤0≤4 yes\n\nτ=2: [-11+8,8] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nτ=3: [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo at τ=0,1,2, second car covers x=0 on y=7.\n\nFreeway 8: y=8\n\nCar: (-48,-59,right,3)\n\nSpan: [-59 + 3τ, -48 + 3τ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 3τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 3τ\n\nFirst: -59 + 3τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 3τ ≤ 59 ⇒ τ ≤ 59/3 ≈ 19.666\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 3τ ⇒ 3τ ≥ 48 ⇒ τ ≥ 16\n\nSo τ from 16 to 19.666, so τ=16,17,18,19.\n\nAt τ=16: -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, [-11,0], 0 in\n\nτ=17: -59+51= -8, -48+51=3, [-8,3], 0 in\n\nτ=18: -59+54= -5, -48+54=6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nτ=19: -59+57= -2, -48+57=9, [-2,9], 0 in\n\nτ=20: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], not\n\nSo collision on y=8 at τ=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at τ=0 to y=9 at some τ.\n\ny=0 is safe, y=9 is safe.\n\nI need to avoid being on a row when it has collision at that τ.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- For y=1: unsafe at τ=1\n\n- y=2: unsafe at τ=0, but τ=0 I'm not on it.

Action at τ=0 determines y at τ=1.\n\nPosition at turn T is after action.\n\nAt turn t₁ + t, for t=0,1,2,... but in terms of τ.\n\nSet τ from 0.\n\nAt time τ, before action, I am at y_τ.\n\nAfter action a_τ, I go to y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy, with Δy based on a_τ.\n\nThen at time τ, I am on row y_τ.\n\nAnd collision check at that row at time τ.\n\nIn the dynamics: at turn T, I am at position, and collision if on freeway y_T, 0 in span at T.\n\nSo at time T, I am at (0, y_T), and if y_T between 1 and 8, and there is car with 0 in span at T, collide.\n\nFor τ=0, T=t₁, I am at y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nNow action a_{t₁} at τ=0, then y_{t₁+1} = y_{t₁} + Δy.\n\ny_{t₁+1} is position at turn t₁+1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo let's define the position at turn t₁ + τ for τ=0,1,2,...\n\nAt τ=0: y=0, safe.\n\nI take action a_{t₁} (which is a_{τ=0}).\n\nIf a=U, then y at τ=1 is 1.\n\nBut at τ=1, if y=1, and y=1 has collision at τ=1, so collide.\n\nIf a=S, y at τ=1 is 0.\n\nIf a=D, y at τ=1 is -1, but y must be >=0, so not allowed.

After 10 actions, I am at turn t₁+10, y=9.\n\nBut the sequence of actions: from τ=0 to τ=9, I have 10 actions: one S and nine U, but I moved from y=0 to y=9, but with one stay at beginning.\n\nActions: at turn t₁: S\n\nThen t₁+1: U\n\nt₁+2: U\n\n...\n\nup to t₁+9: U\n\nAfter 10 actions, at turn t₁+10, y=9.\n\nBut at turn t₁+10, I reach y=9.\n\nNow, is this minimal?\n\nI used 10 turns, but I could do with 9?\n\nMinimal is 9 if no delays.\n\nBut here, at the beginning, I had to stay once because y=1 unsafe at τ=1.\n\nIf I could go directly, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps go down or something, but y=0 is min, so I have to stay at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, I have to take S, because U would go to y=1 at τ=1 and collide.\n\nD not possible.\n\nSo I must start with S, then go up.\n\nSo with one stay, I take 10 turns to reach.\n\nBut let's confirm if all are safe.\n\nAt τ=2, y=1: safe, as established.\n\nAt τ=8, y=7: we checked, no car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=9, y=8: no issue.\n\ny=6 at τ=7: safe.\n\nBut I have to go through y=6, and it is unsafe at τ=8 and 9, but I am at y=6 at τ=7, which is fine.\n\nIn the path, I am at y=6 at τ=7, which is before τ=8, so safe.\n\nThen at τ=8, I am at y=7.\n\nNow, but y=7 is unsafe only up to τ=2, so τ=8 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nBut is there a way to do in 9 turns?\n\nSuppose I start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nIf I take U, I go to y=1 at τ=1, collide, impossible.\n\nSo must not take U at τ=0.\n\nThus, minimal H is 10.\n\nBut perhaps I can go faster later, but since I have to go up 9 times, and I start by staying once, so 10 actions.\n\nUnless I can skip some rows or something, but no, I have to go through each row.\n\nI could go down to avoid something, but in this case, it seems not necessary.\n\nFor example, at y=4 and y=5, unsafe at τ=2, but in my path, I am there at τ=5 and τ=6, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 unsafe at τ=8,9, I am at τ=7, fine.\n\nSo H=10 seems achievable.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nActions from turn t₁:\n\nTurn t₁: S  (since at τ=0, take S)\n\nThen turn t₁+1: U (to y=1 at next turn)\n\nPosition at turn t₁+1: after action, y=0 + Δy, but I took S at t₁, so at turn t₁+1, y=0.\n\nThen at turn t₁+1, I take U, so at turn t₁+2, y=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n- Turn t₁: action S, so position at t₁+1 is (0,0)? No.\n\nAt turn T, position is given before action? I think I need to clarify.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt the start of turn t₁, position is (0,0).\n\nI take action a_{t₁}.\n\nThen position for turn t₁+1 is (0, y_{t₁+1}) with y_{t₁+1} = y_{t₁} + Δy(a_{t₁})\n\nThen at turn t₁+1, I take action a_{t₁+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn based on position at that turn.\n\nAt turn t₁, position (0,0), not on freeway, safe.\n\nAction a_{t₁}: if U, then y_{t₁+1} = 0 + 1 =1, and at turn t₁+1, position (0,1), which is freeway, and if unsafe, collide.\n\nIn this case, at t₁+1, τ=1, y=1, unsafe, collide.\n\nSo must not take U at t₁.\n\nTake S, then y_{t₁+1} =0, position at turn t₁+1 is (0,0), safe.\n\nThen at turn t₁+1, I take action, say U, then y_{t₁+2} =0 +1=1, position at turn t₁+2 is (0,1).\n\nNow turn t₁+2 corresponds to τ=2, since τ= T - t₁, so at T=t₁+2, τ=2.\n\nPosition (0,1), and at τ=2, y=1 is safe.\n\nThen take U, y_{t₁+3} =1+1=2, position at t₁+3, τ=3, y=2 safe.\n\nAnd so on, up to after action at t₁+9, y=9 at turn t₁+10.\n\nActions: from turn t₁ to t₁+9, 10 actions.\n\nTurn t₁: action\n\nt₁+1: action\n\n...\n\nt₁+9: action\n\nAfter action at t₁+9, position at t₁+10.\n\nSo to have position at t₁+H be (0,9), I need H actions from t₁ to t₁+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t₁+H.\n\nSet actions at times t for t = t₁ to t₁ + H-1.\n\nAfter last action at t₁+H-1, position at t₁+H is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, H=10, actions from t₁ to t₁+9.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t₁: S  (so next position y=0)\n\nTurn t₁+1: U  (to y=1 at t₁+2? At turn t₁+1, after action, position.\n\nAfter action at t₁ (S), position at t₁+1 is y=0.\n\nThen at turn t₁+1, I take action U, so position at t₁+2 is y=0 +1 =1.\n\nThen at turn t₁+2, position (0,1), safe (τ=2).\n\nTake action U, position at t₁+3 is y=2.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn t₁+H.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn t₁+10, position y=9.\n\nWith actions:\n\n- a_{t₁} = S\n\n- a_{t₁+1} = U\n\n- a_{t₁+2} = U\n\n- a_{t₁+3} = U\n\n- a_{t₁+4} = U\n\n- a_{t₁+5} = U\n\n- a_{t₁+6} = U\n\n- a_{t₁+7} = U\n\n- a_{t₁+8} = U\n\n- a_{t₁+9} = U\n\nAfter a_{t₁+9} = U, from y=8 to y=9 at turn t₁+10.\n\nNow, H=10.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose I go to y=1 at a different time.\n\nFor example, if I stay more, but that would take more turns.\n\nAt τ=0, I take S, then at τ=1, y=0.\n\nInstead of going up, I could stay again, but that delays.\n\nOr go down, but cannot.\n\nSo minimal is 10.\n\nBut let me check if I can reach earlier.\n\nAnother idea: since y=2 and y=3 are always safe except τ=0, I could go to them directly, but I have to go through y=1 first.\n\nUnless I move multiple steps, but each action only changes by 1, so I must pass each y.\n\nPerhaps at some point I can skip by going faster, but no.\n\nFor example, when going to y=6, if I am late, but in this case, I am at y=6 at τ=7, which is before unsafe τ=8,9.\n\nIf I were to be at y=6 at τ=8, it would collide, but I am not.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 7, it has cars at τ=0,1,2, but I am at y=7 at τ=8, fine.\n\nNow, but in the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut the current turn is t₁=79.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 79: S\n\nTurn 80: U  (since t₁+1=80)\n\nt₁=79\n\nTurn t₁ =79: action a_{79}\n\nAfter action, position at turn 80.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be the action for each turn.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, etc.\n\nSo for H=10, actions from t=79 to 88, and position at turn 89 is (0,9).\n\nt from 79 to 88 inclusive, that's 10 turns, position at 89.\n\nBut t₁+H =79+10=89, y=9.\n\nActions: turn 79 to 88.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 79: S\n\nThen position at 80: (0,0)\n\nTurn 80: action, I take U, so position at 81: (0,1)\n\nTurn 81: action, take U, position at 82: (0,2)\n\n...\n\nUp to:\n\nAfter turn 88 action, position at 89: (0,9)\n\nNow, at which turns are we on which row.\n\nAt turn 79: position (0,0), action S\n\nTurn 80: position (0,0), action U\n\nTurn 81: position (0,1), action U\n\nTurn 82: position (0,2), action U\n\nTurn 83: position (0,3), action U\n\nTurn 84: position (0,4), action U\n\nTurn 85: position (0,5), action U\n\nTurn 86: position (0,6), action U\n\nTurn 87: position (0,7), action U\n\nTurn 88: position (0,8), action U\n\nThen position at 89: (0,9)\n\nNow, collision check at each turn:\n\nTurn 79: y=0, safe\n\nTurn 80: y=0, safe\n\nTurn 81: y=1, at τ=1? Turn T, τ=T - t₁ = T - 79.\n\nAt turn 81, T=81, τ=81-79=2\n\ny=1, at τ=2, safe as before.\n\nTurn 82: T=82, τ=3, y=2, safe\n\nTurn 83: T=83, τ=4, y=3, safe\n\nTurn 84: T=84, τ=5, y=4, safe (τ=5 ≠2)\n\nTurn 85: T=85, τ=6, y=5, safe\n\nTurn 86: T=86, τ=7, y=6, safe (τ=7, not 8 or 9)\n\nTurn 87: T=87, τ=8, y=7, safe (τ=8 >2, no car at x=0)\n\nTurn 88: T=88, τ=9, y=8, safe (τ=9 <16)\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=9?\n\nThat would require reaching at turn 88.\n\nAfter 9 actions, at turn 88.\n\nStart at turn 79, after actions at 79 to 87, position at 88 should be (0,9).\n\nBut to go from y=0 to y=9 in 9 actions, I must increase y by 1 each action, so actions must be all U, no S or D.\n\nBut at turn 79, if I take U, then at turn 80, position (0,1), τ=1, which is unsafe for y=1, collide.\n\nSo impossible to have all U.\n\nThus, minimal H is 10.\n\nPerhaps I can take a detour, but that would take more turns or same, not less.\n\nFor example, if I go down at some point, but y min 0, and it might not help.\n\nSo I think H=10 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have one S at beginning, then all U.\n\nIn the action sequence, turn 79: S, then turn 80 to 88: U each.\n\nBut turn 88: action at turn 88, which is U, to go to y=9 at turn 89.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions from t=79 to t=88 for H=10.\n\nt from 79 to 88, that's 10 actions.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 7 at τ=8.\n\nτ=8, y=7, cars: first car [37 + 4*8, 48 + 4*8] = [37+32,48+32]=[69,80], not cover 0.\n\nSecond car [-11 + 4*8, 4*8] = [-11+32, 32] = [21,32], not cover 0, yes.\n\ny=8 at τ=9: [-59 + 3*9, -48 + 3*9] = [-59+27, -48+27] = [-32,-21], not cover 0.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nTurn 79: S\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nIn the answer, it should be up to when I take the last action to reach.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, meaning the sequence length.\n\nIn the task: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nSo actions from t=0 to H-1, so H actions? t from 0 to H-1, that's H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn this case, H=10, actions at t1 to t1+9.\n\nWith t1=79, actions at 79,80,...,88.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = S\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} = U\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 + 9: a_{t_1 + 9} = U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut in the sequence, I need to specify each.\n\nSince it's repetitive, I can list.\n\nBut in the format, it should be clear.\n\nNow, I think that's it.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 2 and 3, there was a car at τ=0, but I never on those rows at τ=0, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, all covered.\n\nSo minimal H is 10.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 79\\) is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by incorporating a stay (S) at the first turn to avoid the unsafe condition on \\(y = 1\\) at \\(\\tau = 1\\) (where \\(\\tau = T - t_1\\)), followed by upward moves (U) for the remaining turns.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- At turn 79 (\\(\\tau = 0\\)), taking S keeps the player at \\(y = 0\\), which is safe.\n- At turn 80 (\\(\\tau = 1\\)), taking U moves to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 81 (\\(\\tau = 2\\)), avoiding the collision on \\(y = 1\\) at \\(\\tau = 1\\).\n- Subsequent U actions move the player upward through each row, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 89 (\\(\\tau = 10\\)).\n\nThe sequence ensures no collisions:\n- \\(y = 1\\) is unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 1\\); the player is at \\(y = 1\\) at \\(\\tau = 2\\), which is safe.\n- \\(y = 2\\) and \\(y = 3\\) are unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (irrelevant as the player is not on these rows then); all other \\(\\tau\\) are safe.\n- \\(y = 4\\) and \\(y = 5\\) are unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 2\\); the player is at these rows at \\(\\tau = 5\\) and \\(\\tau = 6\\), which are safe.\n- \\(y = 6\\) is unsafe at \\(\\tau = 8\\) and \\(\\tau = 9\\); the player is at \\(y = 6\\) at \\(\\tau = 7\\), which is safe.\n- \\(y = 7\\) is unsafe at \\(\\tau = 0, 1, 2\\); the player is at \\(y = 7\\) at \\(\\tau = 8\\), which is safe.\n- \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe at \\(\\tau = 16\\) to \\(19\\); the player is at \\(y = 8\\) at \\(\\tau = 9\\), which is safe.\n\nThus, the action sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 79: S \\\\\nTurn 80: U \\\\\nTurn 81: U \\\\\nTurn 82: U \\\\\nTurn 83: U \\\\\nTurn 84: U \\\\\nTurn 85: U \\\\\nTurn 86: U \\\\\nTurn 87: U \\\\\nTurn 88: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row, there's no car covering position x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. The cars are defined at turn t_1=80, and I need to simulate their positions for future turns based on their speeds and directions.\n\nThe collision condition is: at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, then for that freeway, if there's a car such that 0 is in its span at time T, I collide. But note that when I move, I'm not on the new row until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe player position update is: at each turn, I choose an action U, D, or S, which changes y by +1, -1, or 0, and y is clamped between 0 and 9.\n\nI start at (0,0) at turn 80. I need to reach (0,9).\n\nNow, the cars: for each freeway, there are cars with head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nDirection: right means the car is moving to the right, so the span increases in x as time increases. Left means moving left, span decreases.\n\nThe span at time T is given by:\n\nFor left-moving car: span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut in the notation, for left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ], but h and τ are positions at t_1. Then at T, it's [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)].\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, at t_1, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed). But for right-moving, span(t_1) is [τ, h] with τ ≤ h I assume, since it's from tail to head.\n\nLet's look at the car state table.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nSince direction right, at t_1=80, span is [τ, h] = [-47, 0]\n\nThen at time T, span(T) = [-47 + 48(T-80), 0 + 48(T-80)] = [48(T-80) - 47, 48(T-80)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 4: (12, 47, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [12, 47]? But it says head h=12, tail τ=47, but if it's left-moving, and head is at 12, tail at 47, that might imply it's facing left, so head is leftmost? I need to interpret head and tail.\n\nIn the car update, for left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ] and then moves to [h - s dt, τ - s dt], so if h and τ are positions, and it's moving left, decreasing x.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, at t_1, head is h, tail is τ, and span is from h to τ, which could be h < τ or h > τ? But in the movement, since it's moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, span increases.\n\nIn the freeway 4: (12, 47, left, 36), so h=12, τ=47, left. Since left, span at t_1 is [h, τ] = [12, 47], and since it's moving left, at T, [12 - 36(T-80), 47 - 36(T-80)].\n\nBut 12 and 47, with 12 < 47, moving left, so left end decreases.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision when for a freeway at time T, if I'm on that freeway y, and for some car on y, 0 is in its span at T.\n\nThe span is a closed interval I assume, so if 0 is between the min and max.\n\nIn terms of the endpoints, since for left-moving [h - s dt, τ - s dt], and for right-moving [τ + s dt, h + s dt], the span is from lower to upper, I think.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: right, [τ, h] at t_1 is [-47, 0], so lower is -47, upper is 0, moving right, so at T, lower = -47 + 48(T-80), upper = 0 + 48(T-80) = 48(T-80)\n\nSince it's moving right, lower increases, upper increases.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 4: left, [h, τ] at t_1 [12,47], lower 12, upper 47? But 12 < 47, so [12,47], moving left, so at T, lower = 12 - 36(T-80), upper = 47 - 36(T-80)\n\nNow, I need to find when 0 is in the span for each car on each freeway, but only at times when I might be there.\n\nSince I start at y=0, and need to go to y=9, I should move up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nThe minimal number of turns would be at least 9, if I go up every turn, but I might need to wait or something to avoid collisions.\n\ny from 0 to 9, but at turn t, I start at y_t, and after action, y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position (0, y_t), and I choose action for that turn, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}), and so on.\n\nI need to reach a state where at some turn T, y_T = 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=80 to t=80+H-1, so after H turns, I am at turn 80+H-1, and y_{80+H-1} = 9.\n\nLet me set t_1 = 80 for simplicity, so current turn is t=80, position y=0.\n\nI need to find H and actions a_80 to a_{80+H-2} such that after H-1 actions, y_{80+H-1} = 9.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nAt time t (starting from t=80), I am at y_t.\n\nI choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to go from y=0 to y=9, I need at least 9 actions: for example, U each time, y_{81} =1, y_{82}=2, ..., y_{89}=9, so H=10 turns? Let's see.\n\nAt t=80, y=0, I choose a_80, then at t=81, y= y_80 + delta a_80.\n\nAfter k actions, I am at time t=80+k, with y_{80+k}.\n\nSet t=80, y=0.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=80, y=0.\n\nAfter 1 action (a_80), at t=81, y= y_80 + delta a_80.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at t=80+k, y_{80+k}.\n\nI want y_{80+k} =9 for some k.\n\nThe minimal k is 9, if I go up every time, y_{89} =9.\n\nBut I need to avoid collisions during the path.\n\nAt each turn t, when I am at y_t, I need that for freeway y_t, at time t, no car has 0 in span.\n\nSince I am on y_t at time t.\n\nNow, for the cars, I need to compute for each freeway and each possible time, whether 0 is covered by some car on that freeway.\n\nFirst, list all cars on each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so at time t, span = [τ + s(t-80), h + s(t-80)] = [-47 + 48(t-80), 0 + 48(t-80)] = [48(t-80) -47, 48(t-80)]\n\n0 in span if 48(t-80) -47 <= 0 <= 48(t-80)\n\nSince 48(t-80) -47 <= 0 <= 48(t-80) implies 0 <= 48(t-80) and 48(t-80) >=47, so 48(t-80) >=47, t-80 >= ceil(47/48)\n\n47/48 <1, so t-80 >=1, since t integer.\n\n48(t-80) >=47, t-80 >= 47/48 ≈ 0.979, so t-80 >=1.\n\nAnd 0 <= 48(t-80) always for t>=80.\n\nAlso, 48(t-80) -47 <=0 <=48(t-80) implies that the lower bound <=0 and upper bound >=0.\n\nLower bound 48(dt) -47 <=0 for dt= t-80 <= 47/48 <1, so for dt=0, lower= -47 <=0, upper=0 >=0, so at t=80, 0 is in span, since [ -47, 0], 0 is included.\n\nAt t=80, for freeway 1, span [ -47, 0], so 0 is in it, since it includes 0.\n\nBut I am at y=0 at t=80, but y=0 is not a freeway? The freeways are from y=1 to y=8, I think.\n\nThe player is on a row, and freeways are at y=1 to 8, where cars are.\n\ny=0 and y=9 might be safe, no cars, I assume.\n\nLet me check the problem.\n\n\"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8\"\n\nAnd player position can be y=0 to 9.\n\nAlso, collision only if on freeway y=1 to 8 and 0 in car span.\n\nSo at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible, I think.\n\nIn the collision condition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nBut y_T is the row I'm on at turn T.\n\nIf y_T =0 or y_T=9, there are no cars, so no collision, since no car on that freeway.\n\nFreeways are only for y=1 to 8.\n\nSo at y=0 and y=9, it's always safe.\n\nI start at y=0, t=80, safe.\n\nNeed to reach y=9.\n\nNow for freeway 1: car at y=1.\n\nAt t=80, span [ -47, 0], so 0 is in span, so if I am on y=1 at t=80, I would collide, but I'm not, I'm at y=0.\n\nNow at time t, span for freeway 1 car: [48(dt) -47, 48(dt)] where dt=t-80.\n\n0 in span if 48(dt) -47 <= 0 <= 48(dt)\n\nWhich is true when 0 <= 48(dt) and 48(dt) >=47, so dt >= ceil(47/48) =1, and 48(dt) >=0 always for dt>=0.\n\nAt dt=0, t=80: [ -47,0], 0 in [ -47,0] yes.\n\nAt dt=1, t=81: [48-47,48] = [1,48], 0 not in [1,48], since 1>0.\n\nSimilarly, for dt>1, it's larger, so 0 not in span for t>80.\n\nSo for freeway 1, car covers 0 only at t=80.\n\nAt t=80, it covers 0, but for t>80, it doesn't.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,12) — head 60, tail 49? Direction right, so at t_1, span [τ, h] = [49,60]? Tail τ, head h.\n\nIn the table: (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h]\n\nSo for this car, h=60, τ=49, so [49,60]\n\nThen at T, [49 + 12(T-80), 60 + 12(T-80)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,12), h=12, τ=1, so [1,12] at t_1, at T [1 + 12(T-80), 12 + 12(T-80)]\n\nNow freeway 2, so for each car, we need to see when 0 in span.\n\nFirst car: [49 + 12 dt, 60 + 12 dt] where dt=T-80.\n\nLower = 49 +12 dt >=49 >0 for dt>=0, so lower >0, so 0 not in span, since min is at least 49.\n\nSimilarly, upper at least 49>0, so never 0 in span for this car.\n\nSecond car: [1 + 12 dt, 12 + 12 dt]\n\nLower =1 +12 dt >=1 >0 for dt>=0, so min at least 1>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nThus for freeway 2, no car covers 0 at any time. So freeway 2 is always safe? Let me confirm.\n\nAt dt=0, [1,12], 1 to 12, 0 not in it.\n\nAt dt=1, [13,24], etc, all positive, so yes, freeway 2 never has a car at x=0.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"3 | (60,49,right,12), (12,1,right,12) |\"\n\nIdentical to freeway 2, so same thing, no car at x=0 ever.\n\nFreeway 4: (12,47,left,36)\n\nDirection left, so span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [12,47] since h=12, τ=47.\n\nAt T, [12 - 36(T-80), 47 - 36(T-80)]\n\n0 in span if 12 -36 dt <= 0 <= 47 -36 dt\n\nWhich requires:\n\nLeft: 12 -36 dt <= 0 => 12 <= 36 dt => dt >= 12/36 = 1/3, so dt >=1 since integer.\n\nAnd right: 0 <= 47 -36 dt => 36 dt <=47 => dt <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so dt <=1.\n\nThus dt=1, t=81.\n\nAt dt=1, [12-36, 47-36] = [-24,11], and 0 is between -24 and 11, so yes.\n\nAt dt=0, [12,47], 12 to 47, 0 not in.\n\nAt dt=1, [-24,11], 0 in.\n\nAt dt=2, [12-72,47-72] = [-60,-25], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at t=81, 0 is covered on freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4, (12,47,left,36), so same, only at t=81, 0 covered.\n\nFreeway 6: (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nDirection right, so at t_1, span [τ, h] = [-53, -42]? Tail τ=-53, head h=-42, so [τ, h] = [-53, -42]\n\nAt T, [-53 + 6(T-80), -42 + 6(T-80)]\n\n0 in span if -53 +6 dt <= 0 <= -42 +6 dt\n\nLeft: -53 +6 dt <=0 => 6 dt <=53 => dt <= 53/6 ≈ 8.833, so dt <=8\n\nRight: 0 <= -42 +6 dt => 42 <=6 dt => dt >= 42/6 =7\n\nSo dt from 7 to 8 inclusive.\n\ndt=7: t=87, span [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0], 0 in [ -11,0]\n\ndt=8: t=88, span [-53+48, -42+48] = [-5,6], 0 in [-5,6]\n\ndt=9: [-53+54, -42+54] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 6 has car at x=0 at t=87 and t=88.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (52,41,right,4) and (4,-7,right,4)\n\nFirst car: (52,41,right,4), span at t_1 [τ, h] = [41,52]? τ=41, h=52, so [41,52]\n\nAt T, [41+4 dt, 52+4 dt], min 41>0, so never 0 in span.\n\nSecond car: (4,-7,right,4), h=4, τ=-7, span [τ, h] = [-7,4]\n\nAt T, [-7 +4 dt, 4 +4 dt]\n\n0 in span if -7 +4 dt <=0 <= 4 +4 dt\n\nLeft: -7+4 dt <=0 => 4 dt <=7 => dt <= 7/4=1.75, dt<=1\n\nRight: 0 <= 4 +4 dt always for dt>=0\n\nAlso, 0 <=4 +4 dt true, and -7+4 dt <=0 for dt<=1.75, so dt=0 or 1.\n\ndt=0: t=80, span [-7,4], 0 in it\n\ndt=1: t=81, span [-7+4,4+4] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\ndt=2: [-7+8,4+8] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo at t=80 and t=81, for the second car, 0 covered.\n\nThus for freeway 7, at t=80 and t=81, 0 is covered by the second car.\n\nFreeway 8: (-45,-56,right,3)\n\nDirection right, span [τ, h] = [-56, -45] at t_1\n\nAt T, [-56 +3 dt, -45 +3 dt]\n\n0 in span if -56 +3 dt <=0 <= -45 +3 dt\n\nLeft: -56 +3 dt <=0 => 3 dt <=56 => dt <= 56/3 ≈18.666, dt<=18\n\nRight: 0 <= -45 +3 dt => 45 <=3 dt => dt >=15\n\nSo dt from 15 to 18 inclusive.\n\nt=80+15=95 to 80+18=98.\n\nBut we may not need to go that far.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway when it is unsafe, i.e., 0 covered.\n\ny=1: unsafe only at t=80 (from car)\n\ny=2: always safe\n\ny=3: always safe (same as y=2)\n\ny=4: unsafe at t=81 (from car)\n\ny=5: unsafe at t=81 (same as y=4)\n\ny=6: unsafe at t=87 and t=88\n\ny=7: unsafe at t=80 and t=81\n\ny=8: unsafe at t=95,96,97,98 (but we might reach before)\n\nI start at t=80, y=0, safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe direct path: go up each turn.\n\nBut I have to go through each row.\n\nAt t=80, I am at y=0.\n\nI choose action at t=80, which affects y at t=81.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, if I go up at each turn:\n\nAt t=80, y=0, choose a_80=U, then at t=81, y=1.\n\nBut at t=81, if I am on y=1, is it safe?\n\ny=1 at t=81: from above, freeway 1 is unsafe only at t=80, but at t=81, it is safe, as we saw earlier, span [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nAt t=81, y=1, freeway 1: at t=81, car span [48(1)-47,48(1)]=[1,48], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen at t=81, I am at y=1, I choose a_81=U, then at t=82, y=2.\n\ny=2 is always safe.\n\nThen similarly, to y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=83, y=3, choose U, to y=4 at t=84.\n\nAt t=84, I am on y=4.\n\ny=4 is unsafe at t=81, but t=84 is later.\n\nAt t=84, freeway 4: car at y=4, span at t: [12 -36(dt), 47-36(dt)] with dt=t-80.\n\nAt t=84, dt=4, [12-144, 47-144] = [-132,-97], both negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at t=85: freeway 5 same, at dt=5, [12-180,47-180]=[-168,-133], safe.\n\nThen y=6 at t=86.\n\ny=6 at t=86: freeway 6, car at (-42,-53,right,6), span at t: [-53 +6(dt), -42+6(dt)]\n\ndt=t-80, t=86, dt=6, span [-53+36, -42+36] = [-17,-6], both negative, 0 not in. Unsafe only at t=87,88.\n\nSo at t=86, safe.\n\nThen at t=86, y=6, choose U, to y=7 at t=87.\n\nAt t=87, y=7.\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at t=80 and t=81.\n\nAt t=87, dt=7, for second car: [-7 +4*7, 4+4*7] = [-7+28,4+28]=[21,32], min 21>0, so safe. First car also safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=88.\n\nAt t=88, y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: at t=88, dt=8, span [-56 +3*8, -45+3*8] = [-56+24, -45+24] = [-32,-21], both negative, 0 not in. Unsafe only later at t=95-98.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=89.\n\nAt t=89, y=9, safe, no cars.\n\nSo in this sequence, all safe, and I reach y=9 at t=89, after 9 actions: from t=80 to t=88, actions a_80 to a_88, y from 0 to 9 in 9 steps.\n\nt=80: y=0, choose a_80=U, to y=1 at t=81\n\nt=81: y=1, choose a_81=U, to y=2 at t=82\n\nt=82: y=2, choose a_82=U, to y=3 at t=83\n\nt=83: y=3, choose a_83=U, to y=4 at t=84\n\nt=84: y=4, choose a_84=U, to y=5 at t=85\n\nt=85: y=5, choose a_85=U, to y=6 at t=86\n\nt=86: y=6, choose a_86=U, to y=7 at t=87\n\nt=87: y=7, choose a_87=U, to y=8 at t=88\n\nt=88: y=8, choose a_88=U, to y=9 at t=89\n\nAt t=89, y=9, done.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt each turn, when on freeway row:\n\nt=81, y=1: freeway 1, at t=81, span [1,48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=82, y=2: freeway 2, always safe, no issue.\n\nt=83, y=3: freeway 3, always safe.\n\nt=84, y=4: freeway 4, at t=84, dt=4, span [12-144,47-144]=[-132,-97], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=85, y=5: freeway 5, similar, safe.\n\nt=86, y=6: freeway 6, at t=86, dt=6, span [-53+36, -42+36]=[-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=87, y=7: freeway 7, at t=87, dt=7, second car [ -7+28, 4+28]=[21,32], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=88, y=8: freeway 8, at t=88, dt=8, span [-56+24, -45+24]=[-32,-21], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAnd at t=80, y=0, safe; t=89, y=9, safe.\n\nSo no collisions.\n\nAnd H=9 turns? From t=80 to t=88, actions at 8 turns? Let's count.\n\nActions: at t=80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88: that's 9 actions.\n\nAfter 9 actions, at t=89, y=9.\n\nMinimal H should be 9, since I need to increase y by 9.\n\nBut is there a way with H=8? That would require decreasing or something, but I start at y=0, need to go to y=9, with 8 actions, the net delta y must be +9, but each action changes y by at most +1, so maximum y after k actions is k, so after 8 actions, y <=8, cannot be 9. So minimal H is 9.\n\nAfter k actions, y_{80+k} <= y_{80} + k = k, since y_80=0.\n\nSo to have y_{80+k} =9, need k>=9.\n\nThus minimal k=9, so H=9 actions, reaching at t=89.\n\nIn the sequence above, it works.\n\nBut in the sequence, I go directly up, no problem.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point I might have issue.\n\nFor example, at t=81, I am on y=1, which is safe, but if I had been on y=1 at t=80, it would be unsafe, but I wasn't.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 unsafe at t=80 and 81, but I am there at t=87, safe.\n\ny=4 unsafe at t=81, but I am there at t=84, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with all actions U.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence for the actions.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nt_1=80.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 88: U\n\nThen at t=89, I don't need action, since I reached.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=80 to t=80+H-1, with H=9, so t=80 to t=88.\n\nActions: a_80 to a_88, all U.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me make sure about the car on freeway 6 and 7.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe at t=87 and 88, but at t=87, I am on y=7, not y=6; at t=88, I am on y=8, not y=6. So no problem.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 unsafe at t=80,81, but I am there at t=87, fine.\n\nSo it seems correct.\n\nBut the task is to reach (0,9), and I do at t=89.\n\nPerhaps I can start later, but since I need minimal H, 9 is minimal.\n\nIn this case, no need to wait.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose I don't go up at some point, it would take more turns, so worse.\n\nFor example, if I stay or go down, it increases H.\n\nSo minimal is 9.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U from t=80 to t=88.\n\nNow, output.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 80: U Turn 81: U Turn 82: U Turn 83: U Turn 84: U Turn 85: U Turn 86: U Turn 87: U Turn 88: U }\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nIn the format, it says: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nAnd in the box.\n\nSince it's a sequence, perhaps list each turn.\n\nIn the example, it might be multiple lines, but in text, I can write as above.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7, I think I missed something.\n\nFreeway 7 has two cars, but I considered the second one for unsafe times.\n\nThe first car is always safe, so only second one matters.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 4 and 5, at t=81, unsafe, but I am not there.\n\nIn my path, I pass y=4 at t=84, which is fine.\n\nBut just to see if there is any constraint that forces me to wait.\n\nFor example, if I wanted to be on y=6 at t=87, it would be unsafe, but I am on y=6 at t=86, which is safe, and move to y=7 at t=87.\n\nAt t=87, y=7 is safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but I cannot, since each step I can only increase by 1.\n\nSo I think it's optimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be all U for 9 turns.\n\nBut let me confirm the number.\n\nt from 80 to 88 inclusive, that's 9 turns: 80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88.\n\nActions at these turns.\n\nThen at t=89, position (0,9).\n\nYes.\n\nSo in the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH=9.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nNow, in the format, it should be like:\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\n...\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nSince it's text, I can write it as a block.\n\nI think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 80\\) is 9. This is achieved by moving up (U) at every turn from turn 80 to turn 88, resulting in the player reaching y=9 at turn 89.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Justification:\n- At turn 80, the player is at y=0, which is safe (no freeway).\n- At turn 81, the player is at y=1. Freeway 1 is unsafe only at turn 80; at turn 81, the car span is [1, 48], which does not contain 0, so it is safe.\n- At turn 82, the player is at y=2. Freeway 2 has no car covering x=0 at any time, so it is safe.\n- At turn 83, the player is at y=3. Freeway 3 has no car covering x=0 at any time, so it is safe.\n- At turn 84, the player is at y=4. Freeway 4 is unsafe only at turn 81; at turn 84, the car span is [-132, -97], which does not contain 0, so it is safe.\n- At turn 85, the player is at y=5. Freeway 5 is unsafe only at turn 81; at turn 85, the car span is [-168, -133], which does not contain 0, so it is safe.\n- At turn 86, the player is at y=6. Freeway 6 is unsafe at turns 87 and 88; at turn 86, the car span is [-17, -6], which does not contain 0, so it is safe.\n- At turn 87, the player is at y=7. Freeway 7 is unsafe at turns 80 and 81; at turn 87, the car span (for the relevant car) is [21, 32], which does not contain 0, so it is safe.\n- At turn 88, the player is at y=8. Freeway 8 is unsafe at turns 95 to 98; at turn 88, the car span is [-32, -21], which does not contain 0, so it is safe.\n- At turn 89, the player is at y=9, which is safe (no freeway).\n\nSince \\(H=9\\) is the minimum possible (as each action can increase y by at most 1, and y must increase from 0 to 9), and the sequence avoids all collisions, it is optimal.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions from turn 80 to turn 88 is all \"U\" (up).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 80: \\, \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 81: \\, \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 82: \\, \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 83: \\, \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 84: \\, \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: \\, \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: \\, \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: \\, \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: \\, \\text{U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get the player from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and each freeway has cars moving left or right at given speeds. Collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, the x-position 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that at turn T, when you move, you are only on the freeway for the position you're at during that turn. So if you move to a new row at turn T, you're not on that new row until the next turn, meaning you only check for collision on the row you're currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t_1 = 81.\n\nPlayer starts at y=1.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y increases when you go up, and we start at 1, to reach 9, we need to increase y by 8, so minimum turns if no obstacles would be 8 turns, all U actions. But there might be cars blocking the way, so I might need to wait or move down temporarily.\n\nBut moving down might not be efficient since we need to go up, but sometimes necessary to avoid cars.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states for each freeway at turn t_1=81.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nFor each car, we have (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nDirection: right means moving right, so if d=right, the car is moving to the right, meaning at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]? Let me check the update rule.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: span at T is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nRight-moving: span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the table, for freeway 1, it has (48,1,right,48), which I think means head=48, tail=1, so span at t1 is from 1 to 48? But for right-moving, if head is larger, it should be [tail, head] or something.\n\nLet's clarify the notation.\n\nIn the car state table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], so I think for a car, τ is the left end and h is the right end if moving right, so head is the front when moving.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], and h is the head, which might be the front when moving left.\n\nFor left-moving car, Span(t1) = [h, τ], and since it's moving left, at time T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)], so if h is the front, moving left, it decreases.\n\nSimilarly for right, moving right, increases.\n\nIn the input, for freeway 1: (48,1,right,48), so head=48, tail=1, direction right, speed 48.\n\nSo at t1=81, span is [τ, h] = [1,48] for right-moving, so from x=1 to x=48.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 4: (-24,11,left,36), head=-24, tail=11, direction left, so Span(t1) = [h, τ] = [-24,11], which is from x=-24 to x=11, and moving left.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway k at turn T, and for that freeway, x=0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at time T.\n\nSince the player is at (0, y_T), so x=0 always.\n\nSo for freeway k at time T, we need that for all cars on freeway k, 0 is not in their span at T.\n\nBut since there might be multiple cars, we need to avoid any car where 0 is in [left, right] at time T for that car.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to see when x=0 is covered by a car.\n\nSince the cars move linearly, I can find for each freeway the times when it is safe to be on that row, i.e., when no car has 0 in its span.\n\nBut the player moves at each turn, so I need to plan a path through the rows over time.\n\nSince we start at y=1 at t=81, and need to reach y=9, and actions change y by -1,0,1, so we can think in terms of time and position.\n\nLet me define t as the turn number, starting from t=81.\n\nAt t=81, y=1.\n\nAt each turn, we choose action, which sets y for next turn, but the collision is checked at the beginning of the turn for the current position.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nAt turn t, the player is at position (0, y_t).\n\nThen we choose action a_t, which determines Δy_t, and thus y_{t+1}.\n\nThe collision is checked at turn T: if player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 in Span(T) for any car.\n\nSpan(T) is the span at time T, as given.\n\nAlso, note: when you move to a new y at turn T, meaning if a_t causes y_{t+1} ≠ y_t, then at turn t, you are on y_t, and at turn t+1, you are on y_{t+1}.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in Span(T) but not Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo at turn T, you are only on y_T for collision purposes.\n\nSimilarly, for the row you're on, you only care about cars on that row at time T.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to be at y=9 at some turn, and since we can stay, we can reach and stop, but we need to minimize turns, so probably we want to get there as fast as possible.\n\nMinimum H is at least 8, since from y=1 to y=9, 8 steps up.\n\nBut with obstacles, it might be more.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=81 to t=81+H-1, we have H actions, and at turn t=81+H-1, y should be 9.\n\nLet t_start = 81.\n\nAfter H turns, time is t_start + H - 1, and y at that time is 9.\n\nFor example, after 0 turns, at t=81, y=1, not 9.\n\nAfter 1 action, at t=82, y could be 0,1,2 depending on a_{81}.\n\nBut we need y=9 at some turn T >= t_start.\n\nSince we start at t=81, y=1, and after H actions, at turn t=81 + H, y_{81+H} = 9, and we have performed H actions from t=81 to t=81+H-1.\n\nThe sequence is {a_t for t from t1 to t1 + H -1}, and at time t1 + H -1, y =9.\n\nAt time t, after action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAt time t, we are at y_t, choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nAnd at time t, collision is checked based on y_t and cars at time t.\n\nSo at time t, position is (0, y_t), and we check if on that row, there is a car covering x=0 at time t.\n\nIf not, safe, else collision.\n\nThen we move to next position.\n\nTo reach y=9, at some time T, we have y_T =9, and no collision at T.\n\nSince we can stay at y=9 once reached, but to minimize time, we probably don't stay unnecessarily.\n\nNow, let's list all the freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeway k=1 to 8.\n\nFor each, cars are given.\n\nBut some have multiple cars, like freeway 2 has two cars.\n\nSo for each freeway, I need to see for what times the row is safe, i.e., no car has 0 in its span at that time.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, the times when 0 is covered are intervals or periodic, but since speeds are constant, it might be periodic or have safe windows.\n\nBut the speeds are different, so I need to compute for each car when it covers x=0.\n\nLet me define t_rel = t - t1 = t - 81, so time relative to current.\n\nFor each car, at time t_rel =0, span is given.\n\nThen at time t_rel, span changes.\n\nFor a car on freeway k.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: k=1, car: (h=48, τ=1, d=right, s=48)\n\nSince d=right, span at time t_rel: [τ + s*t_rel, h + s*t_rel] = [1 + 48*t_rel, 48 + 48*t_rel]\n\nCollision if 0 in [1 + 48*t_rel, 48 + 48*t_rel]\n\nSince the interval is moving right, and t_rel >=0, 1 + 48*t_rel >=1 >0 for t_rel>=0, so left end is at least 1, which is greater than 0, so 0 is never in this interval because min is 1, so always 0 < left, so never covers 0. So freeway 1 is always safe for all t_rel >=0.\n\nIs that right? t_rel=0, span [1,48], 0 not in [1,48], yes. As t increases, the interval moves right, so left end increases, always greater than 0, so 0 never covered. So row 1 is always safe.\n\nBut we start at y=1 at t=81, t_rel=0, and it's safe.\n\nNow freeway 2: k=2, two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nd=right, so span at t_rel: [τ + s*t_rel, h + s*t_rel] = [-59 + 12*t_rel, -48 + 12*t_rel]\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12) head=24, tail=13? For right-moving, span should be [tail, head], so [13,24] at t_rel=0.\n\nIn the input, it's given as (head, tail), so for right, head is larger, so [tail, head].\n\nSimilarly for left, head smaller, [head, tail].\n\nFor first car: (-48, -59, right, 12), so head=-48, tail=-59, d=right, so span [τ, h] = [-59, -48] at t_rel=0.\n\nAt t_rel, [ -59 + 12*t_rel, -48 + 12*t_rel ]\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12), head=24, tail=13, d=right, span [13,24] at t_rel=0, at t_rel [13 + 12*t_rel, 24 + 12*t_rel]\n\nNow, collision if 0 in either span.\n\nFirst car: 0 in [ -59 + 12*t_rel, -48 + 12*t_rel ]\n\nWhich means -59 + 12*t_rel <= 0 <= -48 + 12*t_rel\n\nSince -59 +12t <=0 and 0 <= -48 +12t\n\nFrom -59 +12t <=0 => 12t <=59 => t <= 59/12 = 4.916, so t_rel <=4 since t integer? t_rel is turn number, so integer.\n\nt is discrete turns, so t_rel integer >=0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -48 +12t => 12t >=48 => t >=4.\n\nSo for first car, 0 covered when t >=4 and t <=4.916, so t=4? Let's see:\n\nt >= ceil(48/12) = ceil(4) =4\n\nt <= floor(59/12) = floor(4.916) =4? 59/12=4.916, floor is 4.\n\nInequalities:\n\n-59 +12t <=0 => 12t <=59 => t <= 59/12 = 4 + 11/12, so since t integer, t <=4\n\nAnd 0 <= -48 +12t => 12t >=48 => t>=4\n\nSo t=4.\n\nAt t_rel=4, span: -59 +12*4 = -59+48= -11, -48+48=0? -48 +12*4 = -48+48=0, so span [ -11, 0 ] at t_rel=4.\n\n-59+48= -11, -48+48=0, so [ -11, 0 ], so 0 is included, since right end is 0.\n\nCollision if 0 in [left, right], and if right=0, it is included, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, left=-11, so [ -11, 0 ], 0 is in it.\n\nAt t=5, -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nAt t=4, [ -11, 0 ], 0 in.\n\nNow second car: 0 in [13 +12t, 24 +12t]\n\n13+12t <=0? 13+12t >=13>0, so left end >=13>0, so 0 always less than left, never covered. So only first car can cover 0 at t_rel=4.\n\nSo for freeway 2, unsafe only at t_rel=4.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"3 | (-48, -59, right, 12), (24, 13, right, 12) \"\n\nIdentical to freeway 2, so unsafe only at t_rel=4.\n\nNow freeway 4: k=4, one car: (-24,11,left,36)\n\nd=left, so span at t_rel: [h - s*t_rel, τ - s*t_rel] since moving left.\n\nh=-24, τ=11, s=36, d=left.\n\nSpan at t_rel=0: [h, τ] = [-24,11]\n\nAt t_rel: [h - s t_rel, τ - s t_rel] = [-24 -36 t_rel, 11 -36 t_rel]\n\nCollision if 0 in this interval.\n\nSo -24 -36t <=0 and 0 <=11 -36t? Let's see:\n\n0 in [left, right] means left <=0 and right >=0.\n\nSo -24 -36t <=0 and 11 -36t >=0\n\nFirst: -24 -36t <=0 => -36t <=24 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality, 36t >= -24, which is always true since t>=0.\n\n-24 -36t <=0 => -36t <=24, divide by -36, reverse: t >= -24/36 = -2/3, which is true for t>=0.\n\nSecond inequality: 11 -36t >=0 => 36t <=11 => t <= 11/36 ≈0.305, so t=0 since t integer.\n\nAt t_rel=0: left= -24, right=11, 0 in [-24,11], yes.\n\nAt t=1: left= -24-36= -60, right=11-36= -25, so [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe only at t_rel=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as 4? \"5 | (-24,11,left,36) \" identical, so unsafe only at t_rel=0.\n\nNow freeway 6: k=6, one car: (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nd=right, so span at t_rel: [τ + s t_rel, h + s t_rel] = [-47 +6 t_rel, -36 +6 t_rel]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -47 +6t, -36 +6t ]\n\nSo -47 +6t <=0 and 0 <= -36 +6t\n\nFirst: -47+6t <=0 => 6t <=47 => t <= 47/6 ≈7.833, t<=7\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 +6t => 6t >=36 => t>=6\n\nSo t from 6 to 7 inclusive.\n\nt=6: -47+36= -11, -36+36=0, so [ -11, 0 ], 0 included.\n\nt=7: -47+42= -5, -36+42=6, [ -5, 6 ], 0 in it.\n\nt=8: -47+48=1, -36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe at t_rel=6 and 7.\n\nNow freeway 7: k=7, two cars.\n\nFirst car: (56,45,right,4) head=56, tail=45, d=right, span at t_rel: [45 +4 t_rel, 56 +4 t_rel]\n\nSecond car: (8,-3,right,4) head=8, tail=-3, d=right, span: [-3 +4 t_rel, 8 +4 t_rel]\n\nNow, collision if 0 in either.\n\nFirst car: 0 in [45+4t, 56+4t]? 45+4t >=45>0, so min 45>0, 0 never covered.\n\nSecond car: 0 in [ -3 +4t, 8 +4t ]\n\n-3+4t <=0 and 0 <=8+4t\n\nFirst: -3+4t <=0 => 4t<=3 => t<=3/4=0.75, t<=0\n\nSecond: 0<=8+4t always true for t>=0.\n\nSo only t=0 possible? t<=0 and t>=0, t integer, t_rel=0.\n\nAt t=0: [ -3,8], 0 in it.\n\nAt t=1: [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe only at t_rel=0 for second car.\n\nNow freeway 8: k=8, one car: (-42,-53,right,3)\n\nd=right, span: [τ + s t_rel, h + s t_rel] = [-53 +3 t_rel, -42 +3 t_rel]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -53 +3t, -42 +3t ]\n\n-53+3t <=0 and 0 <= -42 +3t\n\nFirst: -53+3t <=0 => 3t<=53 => t<=53/3≈17.666, t<=17\n\nSecond: 0<= -42+3t => 3t>=42 => t>=14\n\nSo t from 14 to 17 inclusive.\n\nt=14: -53+42= -11, -42+42=0, [ -11,0]\n\nt=15: -53+45= -8, -42+45=3, [ -8,3], 0 in\n\n...\n\nt=17: -53+51= -2, -42+51=9, [ -2,9], 0 in\n\nt=18: -53+54=1, -42+54=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo unsafe for t_rel=14,15,16,17.\n\nNow summarize safe times for each row:\n\ny=1: always safe, as we saw.\n\ny=2: unsafe only at t_rel=4\n\ny=3: same as y=2, unsafe at t_rel=4\n\ny=4: unsafe at t_rel=0\n\ny=5: unsafe at t_rel=0\n\ny=6: unsafe at t_rel=6 and 7\n\ny=7: unsafe at t_rel=0\n\ny=8: unsafe at t_rel=14,15,16,17\n\nWe start at t_rel=0, y=1.\n\nAt t_rel=0, y=1 is safe, as always.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, I think? Freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are the ends, no cars, so safe to be there anytime.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is not on a freeway, so no collision possible there.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is safe.\n\nNow, we start at y=1, t_rel=0.\n\nWe need to get to y=9 at some T.\n\nSince we can move up or down, but we want to minimize time, we should try to go up as much as possible, but avoid the unsafe times.\n\nThe unsafe times are only at specific points for most rows, except y=8 has a range.\n\nLet me list for each row, the unsafe t_rel:\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: unsafe at t=4\n\ny=3: unsafe at t=4\n\ny=4: unsafe at t=0\n\ny=5: unsafe at t=0\n\ny=6: unsafe at t=6,7\n\ny=7: unsafe at t=0\n\ny=8: unsafe at t=14,15,16,17\n\ny=9: always safe\n\nWe start at t=0, y=1.\n\nAt t=0, we are at y=1, safe.\n\nWe choose action for this turn.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal time might be less than 8 if we can go up faster, but we can only change by 1 per turn, so minimum 8 turns to increase y by 8.\n\nBut with obstacles, it might take more.\n\nSince some rows have unsafe times, we might need to time our movement to avoid those times on each row.\n\nSpecifically, we need to be on each row only when it is safe, but since we pass through rows, we need to be on a row at a time when it is safe.\n\nFor example, to go from y=1 to y=2, we need to be at y=2 at some t, and at that t, it must be safe.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nSince we can stay or move down, we might spend multiple turns on a row or go down to avoid being on a row at bad times.\n\nBut since we want to minimize time, we should avoid unnecessary moves or waits.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nWe start at t=0, y=1.\n\nWe need to increase y to 9.\n\nThe constraints:\n\n- At y=4, unsafe at t=0, so we cannot be at y=4 at t=0. But at t=0, we are at y=1, so y=4 is not occupied at t=0, so it's fine, but if we want to be at y=4, it must not be at t=0.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 unsafe at t=0, y=7 unsafe at t=0.\n\nt=0 is only one time.\n\nNow, y=2 and y=3 unsafe at t=4.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=6 and 7.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=14-17.\n\nSince we start at t=0, and want to reach y=9 quickly, we should go up as fast as possible, but avoid the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, from t=0, y=1.\n\nWe can go up to y=2 at t=1.\n\nt=0: at y=1, choose action.\n\nIf we choose U, then at t=1, we will be at y=2.\n\nNow, y=2 is unsafe only at t=4, so at t=1, it should be safe, since t=1 !=4.\n\nSimilarly, we can go to y=3 at t=2, also safe since t=2 !=4.\n\nThen to y=4 at t=3.\n\ny=4 is unsafe at t=0, but at t=3, is it safe?\n\ny=4 unsafe only at t=0, so for t!=0, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 unsafe only at t=0, so at t=3, safe.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=6 and 7, so at t=3, safe.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=0, so at t=3, safe.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=14-17, so at t=3, safe.\n\ny=9 always safe.\n\nSo if we go up every turn, from t=0 to t=7:\n\nt=0: start y=1, choose a_t for this turn.\n\nAction at t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt time t, position y_t, choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nAt time t, we are at y_t, and collision checked.\n\nThen at next turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nAt t=0 (t_rel=0), we are at y=1.\n\nChoose a_0 (for turn t=81, but using t_rel for simplicity).\n\na_0: if U, then y_{1} =2\n\nIf D, y_{1}=0\n\nIf S, y_{1}=1\n\nSimilarly.\n\nWe want to minimize the time to reach y=9.\n\nSuppose we always go up when possible.\n\nStart:\n\nt=0: y=1, safe. Choose U, so y_{1}=2\n\nt=1: at y=2, now we need to check if safe. y=2 unsafe at t=4, t=1 !=4, so safe. Choose U, y_{2}=3\n\nt=2: at y=3, unsafe at t=4, t=2!=4, safe. Choose U, y_{3}=4\n\nt=3: at y=4, unsafe at t=0, t=3!=0, so safe. Choose U, y_{4}=5\n\nt=4: at y=5, now t=4, y=5 unsafe at t=0, but t=4 !=0, so should be safe? y=5 unsafe only at t=0, so at t=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 unsafe only t=0, y=7 unsafe only t=0.\n\nSo at t=4, y=5, safe. Choose U, y_{5}=6\n\nt=5: at y=6, now y=6 unsafe at t=6 and t=7.\n\nt=5, not 6 or 7, so safe. But we need to go to y=7, but at t=5, if we choose U, y_{6}=7\n\nThen t=6: at y=7, now t=6, y=7 unsafe at t=0, t=6 !=0, so safe? y=7 unsafe only t=0, so yes, safe at t=6.\n\nBut at t=6, we are at y=7, safe.\n\nThen we can choose to go to y=8.\n\nBut y=8 at time t.\n\nIf at t=6, we choose U, then y_{7}=8\n\nThen at t=7, we are at y=8.\n\nNow y=8 unsafe at t=14-17, t=7 not in that range, so safe.\n\nThen choose U to y=9.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nt=5: at y=6, choose U, so y_{6}=7\n\nt=6: at y=7, since y=7 unsafe only t=0, safe at t=6. Choose U, so y_{7}=8\n\nt=7: at y=8, safe since t=7 not in 14-17. Choose U, y_{8}=9\n\nt=8: at y=9, which is safe, and we reached.\n\nNow, how many turns? From t=0 to t=8, we reached y=9 at t=8.\n\nt=0: y=1\n\nAfter actions: after H actions, at time t=H, y=9.\n\nIn terms of turns: we performed actions at t=0 to t=7, 8 actions, and at time t=8, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, so actions from t=0 to t=H-1, and at time t=H-1, y=9? No.\n\nLet's clarify the time.\n\nAt start: time t=0, position y=1.\n\nAfter first action (at t=0), we go to time t=1 with new y.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at time t=H, with y=9.\n\nThe actions are performed at times t=0 to t=H-1.\n\nAt time t=H, we are at y=9.\n\nIn this case, we started at t=0, y=1.\n\nAfter 8 actions: actions at t=0 to t=7.\n\nAt t=0: action U, to y=2 at t=1\n\nAt t=1: action U, to y=3 at t=2\n\nAt t=2: action U, to y=4 at t=3\n\nAt t=3: action U, to y=5 at t=4\n\nAt t=4: action U, to y=6 at t=5\n\nAt t=5: action U, to y=7 at t=6\n\nAt t=6: action U, to y=8 at t=7\n\nAt t=7: action U, to y=9 at t=8\n\nAt time t=8, y=9.\n\nNow, collision check:\n\nAt each time, we need to check if at that position, it was safe.\n\nt=0: y=1, safe\n\nt=1: y=2, t=1, y=2 unsafe only at t=4, so t=1 safe\n\nt=2: y=3, unsafe at t=4, t=2 safe\n\nt=3: y=4, unsafe at t=0, t=3 safe\n\nt=4: y=5, unsafe at t=0, t=4 safe\n\nt=5: y=6, unsafe at t=6 and 7, t=5 not, so safe\n\nt=6: y=7, unsafe at t=0, t=6 safe\n\nt=7: y=8, unsafe at t=14-17, t=7 safe\n\nt=8: y=9, safe\n\nSo all safe, and we reached in 8 turns.\n\nBut is y=6 safe at t=5? Yes.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=5, we are at y=6, which is safe since t=5 not 6 or 7.\n\nThen we move to y=7 at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, we are at y=7, which is safe.\n\nBut y=6 is unsafe at t=6 and t=7, but at t=6, we are at y=7, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=7, we are at y=8, not y=6.\n\nSo we are never on y=6 at t=6 or t=7, so no problem.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=6 only at t=5, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue with other rows.\n\nBut what about y=2 and y=3 at t=4? We are not on them at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, we are at y=5.\n\nAnd y=5 is safe at t=4.\n\nIn the summary, all seems fine.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=4 and y=5 are unsafe at t=0, but we are there at t=3 and t=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at t=6, safe.\n\nSo this path should work in 8 turns.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 is y=7, which has cars.\n\nAt t_rel=0, y=7 unsafe, but at t=6, which is t_rel=6, should be safe.\n\nFor freeway 7: at t_rel, the second car covers 0 only at t_rel=0.\n\nAt t_rel=6, for example, the cars: first car [45+4*6,56+4*6]=[45+24,56+24]=[69,80], not 0.\n\nSecond car [-3+4*6,8+4*6]=[-3+24,8+24]=[21,32], not 0. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\ny=6 at t=5: freeway 6, car at t_rel=5: [ -47 +6*5, -36 +6*5] = [-47+30, -36+30] = [-17, -6], which is all negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nAt t=6: we are not on y=6, so no need.\n\nIn this path, we reach y=9 at t=8 with 8 actions.\n\nBut is there a faster way? Minimum is 8, so no.\n\nWe could go slower, but that would take more turns.\n\nBut in this case, it seems we can do it in 8.\n\nBut let me check if at any point we are forced to wait.\n\nFor example, at t=4, we are at y=5, which is safe, no problem.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 faster, but no, from y=1 to y=9, minimum 8 moves up.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, so 8 U actions needed.\n\nIn 8 actions, we can go directly.\n\nBut in this case, it worked.\n\nBut I recall that at t=4, y=2 and y=3 are unsafe, but we are not on them.\n\nSimilarly, t=0, y=4,5,7 unsafe, but we are not on them at t=0.\n\nAt t=0, we are on y=1, safe.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we did.\n\nBut let me confirm the car states again.\n\nAnother thing: for freeway 2 and 3, unsafe at t=4, but we are on y=2 at t=1, y=3 at t=2, not at t=4.\n\ny=4 at t=3, etc.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is there a reason we might need to avoid going up at some point? Not in this path.\n\nPerhaps we should consider if we need to be on y=8 later, but in this case, we pass y=8 at t=7, which is before t=14, so safe.\n\ny=8 unsafe only from t=14 to 17, which is later, so we are fine.\n\nSo minimal H=8, with all U actions.\n\nBut let me write the actions.\n\nIn terms of the original turn.\n\nt1 = 81\n\nSo actions at turn 81 to 88? Let's see.\n\nAt time t=81 (t_rel=0), position y=1, choose action for turn 81.\n\nWe choose U, so at t=82, y=2.\n\nThen at t=82, position y=2, choose U, to y=3 at t=83.\n\nt=83, y=3, choose U, to y=4 at t=84.\n\nt=84, y=4, choose U, to y=5 at t=85.\n\nt=85, y=5, choose U, to y=6 at t=86.\n\nt=86, y=6, choose U, to y=7 at t=87.\n\nt=87, y=7, choose U, to y=8 at t=88.\n\nt=88, y=8, choose U, to y=9 at t=89.\n\nAt t=89, y=9, reached.\n\nWe performed actions from t=81 to t=88, that's 8 actions, H=8.\n\nAt time t=89, y=9.\n\nThe sequence is actions for turns starting from t1=81 to t1 + H -1 =81+7=88? t1 + H -1.\n\nt1=81, H=8, so actions from t=81 to t=81 + 7 =88, and at time t=81+7=88, after action, y=9? No.\n\nAfter action at t=88, we go to t=89 with y=9.\n\nBut at time t=88, we are at y=8, and we choose action U, which sets y_{89}=9.\n\nThen at time t=89, we are at y=9.\n\nThe time when we reach y=9 is t=89.\n\nIn the action sequence, we have actions for turns t=81 to t=88, 8 actions, and after that, at t=89, y=9.\n\nThe problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, such that at time t1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), ... such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\"\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1 + H -1 is the time when y=9.\n\nAnd actions are from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, so actions at times t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, action at t1, and at time t1 +1 -1 =t1, y=9, meaning we start at y=9? But we start at y=1.\n\nIn general, after H actions, at time t1 + H, y=9.\n\nBut according to the notation, y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet T = t1 + H -1, so at time T, y_T=9.\n\nAnd actions from t=t1 to t=t1 + H -1, which is from t1 to T.\n\nAt each action time, we choose a_t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nAt time t, we are at y_t, choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nSo for time T to be t1 + H -1, and y_T=9.\n\nThen the actions are for t from t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, we want at time T= t1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nIn our sequence, we have at time t=89, y=9, and t1=81, so t1 + H -1 =89.\n\n81 + H -1 =89, so 80 + H =89, H=9.\n\nI think I confused the indexing.\n\nStart: at time t1=81, y=1.\n\nWe perform action at t1=81, which sets y for next time.\n\nAfter action at t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nWe want y at some time to be 9.\n\nThe time when y=9 is after all actions.\n\nSuppose we perform actions at times: t1, t1+1, ..., up to t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have set y_{t1 +1}, y_{t1+2}, ..., up to y_{t1 + H}.\n\nThe position after H actions is at time t1 + H.\n\nBut we want y at time t1 + H to be 9? Not necessarily, because we might reach earlier.\n\nThe condition is that at time t1 + H -1, y=9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd actions from t=t1 to t=t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if we do nothing, at t1, y=1, not 9.\n\nAfter one action: action at t1, sets y_{t1+1}.\n\nThen at time t1+1, y_{t1+1} could be 0,1,2.\n\nWe want at time t1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nIn our earlier plan, we have at time t=89, y=9.\n\nt=89, t1=81, so t = t1 + 8.\n\nt1 + H -1 = 81 + H -1 =89, so 80 + H =89, H=9.\n\nActions from t=81 to t=81+8=89? t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1+H-1=89, so if H=9, t1+H-1=81+9-1=89, yes.\n\nActions at t=81 to t=89? t1 to t1+H-1=89, so t=81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89? That's 9 actions.\n\nBut in our sequence, we have actions at t=81 to t=88, 8 actions, leading to y=9 at t=89.\n\nBut according to the condition, we need y at time t1+H-1=89 to be 9, which is satisfied, and actions for t from 81 to 89? t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nIf H=9, t1+H-1=81+8=89? 81+9-1=89, yes.\n\nBut we only need actions up to when we set y to 9.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=88, we are at y=8, choose U, so y_{89}=9.\n\nThen at time t=89, y=9.\n\nSo to have y_{89}=9, we need to have performed action at t=88 to set it.\n\nActions from t=81 to t=88, which is 8 actions, but time 89 is after 8 actions.\n\nt1+H-1=89, with H=9, actions at t=81 to 89.\n\nBut at t=89, if we perform an action, it would set y_{90}, but we don't need to, since we are already at y=9 at t=89.\n\nThe sequence should include actions until the turn before we reach, but since at time T, we are at y_T=9, and we may have performed an action at T to get there or stayed.\n\nIn this case, at time t=89, y=9, which could be because we were at y=9 at t=88 and stayed, or moved from y=8.\n\nBut in our case, we moved from y=8 at t=88 to y=9 at t=89.\n\nSo at time t=88, we were at y=8, chose U, so y_{89}=9.\n\nThen at t=89, we are at y=9.\n\nNow, for the action sequence, we need actions from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, and at time t1+H-1, y=9.\n\nHere t1+H-1=89, y=9.\n\nActions at t=81 to 89? But at t=89, if we are at y=9, we might choose to stay or something, but we don't need to act after reaching, but the sequence includes actions up to t=t1+H-1.\n\nSince at t=89, we are at y=9, we can choose action S or whatever, but since we have reached, it doesn't matter, but to minimize H, we should stop as soon as we reach.\n\nIn this case, we reach at t=89, so H should be such that t1+H-1=89, so 81+H-1=89, H=9.\n\nBut with H=9, we can have actions from t=81 to t=89.\n\nBut at t=89, since we are at y=9, we can choose S, for example.\n\nBut in our sequence, we only used 8 actions to get there, but the last action is at t=88 to move to y=9 at t=89.\n\nSo for the sequence, actions at t=81 to t=88: all U, and at t=89, we don't need an action, but the sequence must include up to t=t1+H-1.\n\nIf H=9, we need to specify action at t=89 as well.\n\nBut since we are already at y=9 at t=89, we can choose S.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence, we can have 8 U and then one S at the end, but that would be inefficient, taking an extra turn.\n\nBut we reached at t=89 with 8 moves, but to satisfy y_{t1+H-1}=9, with H=9, t1+H-1=89, y=9.\n\nWith H=8, t1+H-1=81+8-1=88, so we need y at time 88 to be 9.\n\nBut in our sequence, at time 88, we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y=9 at t=88, we need to be at y=9 earlier.\n\nBut we start at y=1 at t=81, to be at y=9 at t=88, that is 7 turns later, but from y=1 to y=9, minimum 8 moves, so impossible to be at y=9 at t=88 with start at y=1 t=81.\n\nt=81 to t=88 is 7 time steps? From t=81 to t=88, time difference 7, so y can change by at most 7, from 1 to 8, not to 9.\n\nSince y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, |delta|<=1, so from t=81 to t=88, 7 steps, y can go from 1 to at most 8, or min 1-7=-6, but bounded, so y_88 <= 1+7=8, cannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=9 at time T, we need T >= t1 + 8, since from y=1, need at least 8 increases.\n\nEarliest at t=89.\n\nSo y_{89}=9.\n\nThen t1 + H -1 =89, 81 + H -1=89, H=9.\n\nActions from t=81 to t=89.\n\nAt t=81 to t=88: we can do U each time to reach y=9 at t=89.\n\nThen at t=89, we are at y=9, and we need to choose an action, but since we are already there, we can choose S.\n\nSo the sequence: for t=81 to 88: U, and for t=89: S, but that takes 9 actions to reach at t=89 with the last action being S.\n\nBut we could have reached at t=89 with 8 U actions from t=81 to 88, and no action at t=89 needed, but the sequence must include up to t=t1+H-1=89.\n\nSo H=9, with actions: a81 to a88: U, a89: S.\n\nBut that seems wasteful, but necessary because of the indexing.\n\nSince at t=89, y=9, choosing S is fine.\n\nBut in terms of the number of actions to reach, it is 8, but H includes the turns including when we are already there.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier, but we cannot.\n\nAnother way: if we start at t=81 y=1, and immediately at t=81, if we were at y=9, but we are not.\n\nSo minimal H is 9, with 8 moves and one stay or something.\n\nIn the sequence, for turns t=81 to t=88: action U, then at t=89, action S.\n\nBut at t=89, we are already at y=9, and choosing S keeps it.\n\nIn the collision check, at t=89, y=9, no car, safe.\n\nBut in our path, we don't have issue.\n\nWith H=9, we have an extra turn, but since we are at y=9, it's fine.\n\nBut in this case, with the all-up path, we can do it with actions: t=81 to 88: U, and t=89: S, but we reached at t=89.\n\nSince we need to specify the sequence, and H=9.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach with H=8 if we are at y=9 at t=88, but impossible.\n\nSo H=9 is minimum.\n\nIn the action sequence, for t=81 to 88: U, and for t=89: since we are at y=9, we must choose an action, S or U or D, but U or D might go out of bound, but y=9, U would go to 10, but y must be in [0,9], so if y=9, U is invalid? The player update says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=9, a_t=U would make y_{t+1}=10, which is invalid, so probably not allowed, or perhaps it is clipped, but the rule says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so I think actions that would cause out of bound are not allowed, or we must choose action such that y stays within bounds.\n\nSimilarly for y=0, cannot go down.\n\nSo at y=9, possible actions are D or S, not U.\n\nSimilarly, at y=0, U or S, not D.\n\nIn this case, at t=89, y=9, we can choose S or D.\n\nBut D would go down to 8, which is not desired, so we choose S.\n\nNow, back to the path: with the all-up, we can reach y=9 at t=89 with actions U from t=81 to 88.\n\nThen at t=89, action S.\n\nBut is there a problem in the path?\n\nEarlier I thought at t=4, y=5, but t=4 relative is t=85.\n\nt_rel=4 is t=85.\n\nAt t=85, we are at y=5.\n\ny=5 freeway, at t_rel=4, which is safe since only unsafe at t_rel=0.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nBut let me confirm y=6 at t=86.\n\nt=86 is t_rel=5? t_rel = t - 81.\n\nt=86, t_rel=5.\n\ny=6 at t_rel=5.\n\nFreeway 6: car span at t_rel=5: [-47 +6*5, -36 +6*5] = [-47+30, -36+30] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at t=87, y=7, t_rel=6.\n\nFreeway 7: cars at t_rel=6: first [45+24,56+24]=[69,80], second [-3+24,8+24]=[21,32], 0 not in.\n\nt=88, y=8, t_rel=7.\n\ny=8 freeway: car at t_rel=7: [-53+3*7, -42+3*7] = [-53+21, -42+21] = [-32,-21], 0 not in, since left=-32<0, right=-21<0, so 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at t=89, y=9, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut with H=9, actions: turn 81: U, turn 82: U, ..., up to turn 88: U, and turn 89: S.\n\nBut turn 89 is the last action.\n\nSince we reach at t=89, and action at t=89 is S, it keeps y=9.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, we have 9 actions, but the first 8 get us there.\n\nBut H=9 is minimal possible.\n\nPerhaps we can reach in fewer if we move down or something, but unlikely.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=0, then up, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo H=9 with this sequence.\n\nBut let me see if we can avoid the S at the end.\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at an earlier time, but impossible.\n\nAnother thing: at t=0, we are at y=1, but if we could be at y=9 at t=81, but we cannot.\n\nSo I think H=9 is correct.\n\nNow, in the answer format, we need to list the actions.\n\nBut in this case, with all U, it works.\n\nBut is there any issue at t=4 relative?\n\nt_rel=4 is t=85.\n\nAt t=85, we are at y=5, which is safe.\n\nBut y=2 and y=3 are unsafe at t=85, but we are not on them.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nBut let me check freeway 2 at t=85, t_rel=4.\n\nFreeway 2: at t_rel=4, first car: [-59+48, -48+48]=[-11,0], so 0 covered, so if we were on y=2 at t=85, collision, but we are on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, fine.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nThen at turn 89, we need to specify action, since H=9, actions from 81 to 89.\n\nAt turn 89, we are at y=9, so choose S.\n\nTurn 89: S\n\nBut H=9, and we have 9 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1} = a_{81} to a_{89}.\n\nAnd at time t1+H-1=89, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nTo write the answer.\n\nBut in the box.\n\nBut let me see if we can have H=8, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at t=88 by some other path, but cannot.\n\nSuppose we start by going down to y=0, then up, but that takes more time.\n\nFor example, at t=81, go D to y=0 at t=82.\n\nThen at t=82, y=0, go U to y=1 at t=83, etc., but this would take at least 10 turns to reach y=9, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=9 with the sequence above.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 89, action S.\n\nBut since we need to specify, and it is required.\n\nPerhaps the action at turn 89 is not necessary, but according to the problem, we must specify for H turns.\n\nAnother thought: in the definition, the sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith H=9, t1+H-1=89, y=9.\n\nWith actions including a_{89}.\n\nSince at t=89, y=9, we choose S.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut let me confirm if in the all-up path, we missed something.\n\nFreeway 7 has two cars, but we checked.\n\nAt t=87, which is t_rel=6, y=7, we have freeway 7 safe.\n\nBut freeway 7 car: second car covers 0 only at t=0, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=9, actions: U for turns 81 to 88, S for turn 89.\n\nBut turn 89 is t1 + H -1 =81+9-1=89.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,1), and we go up to (0,9).\n\nNow, the answer format.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 81: U\nTurn 82: U\nTurn 83: U\nTurn 84: U\nTurn 85: U\nTurn 86: U\nTurn 87: U\nTurn 88: U\nTurn 89: S\n}\n\nWith H=9.\n\nBut is S necessary? Since we are at y=9, we can choose D, but that would go down to 8, then we are not at 9, so we must choose S to stay.\n\nU is invalid, so only S or D, D is bad, so S.\n\nIn the sequence, it works.\n\nPerhaps we can reach without the last S, but with H=9, we have to include it.\n\nAnother idea: since at turn 88, after action U, we are at y=9 at t=89, but at turn 88, we performed action to move there.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 89, we need to specify an action, but since y=9, we choose S.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 8, but only if we can be at y=9 at t=88, impossible.\n\nSo I think H=9 is correct.\n\nIn the initial calculation, I thought 8 actions, but due to indexing, H=9.\n\nSimilarly, in general, from y=a to y=b, min H = |b-a| +1 if we move directly, but since we start at time t1 y=a, to reach y=b at time T, min T-t1 = |b-a|, and H = T - t1 + 1? Let's see.\n\nTime from t1 to T, with T = t1 + delta t.\n\nNumber of actions between t1 and T-1 or something.\n\nSet delta t = T - t1, the time difference.\n\nAt time t1, y=a.\n\nAfter delta t time steps, at time t1 + delta t, y=b.\n\nThe number of actions performed: from turn t1 to turn t1 + delta t - 1? \n\nAt each turn from t1 to t1 + delta t -1, we perform an action, which determines y for next time.\n\nAfter actions at t1 to t1 + delta t -1, we have y at time t1 + delta t.\n\nSo to have y_{t1 + delta t} = b.\n\nThe number of actions is delta t.\n\nThen H, the number of turns, is such that y_{t1 + H -1} = b.\n\nSo t1 + H -1 = t1 + delta t, so H -1 = delta t, H = delta t +1.\n\nSince delta t min = |b-a|, so H min = |b-a| +1.\n\nIn this case, |9-1|=8, so H min=9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for this, H=9.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have 8 U and one S at the end.\n\nBut since the S is at the end when we are already there, it doesn't add to the reaching time.\n\nBut in terms of the definition, it is required.\n\nPerhaps for turn 89, we can choose any action, but S is fine.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there a way to reach at t=88? No.\n\nSuppose we go up faster, but cannot.\n\nOr avoid some row at critical time, but in this path, no issue.\n\nAnother thing: at t_rel=0, if we were on y=4,5,7, it would be unsafe, but we are on y=1.\n\nSimilarly, at t=4, y=2,3 unsafe, but we are not.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 81\\) and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimum number of turns required to move from \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is 8 upward moves, but due to the game's indexing, \\(H = 9\\) is required to satisfy \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\\). The sequence of actions consists of 8 \"U\" (up) actions to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 89, followed by an \"S\" (stay) action at turn 89 to maintain \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe path is collision-free:\n- At turn 81 (\\(t_\\text{rel} = 0\\)), \\(y = 1\\): safe (freeway 1 always safe).\n- At turn 82 (\\(t_\\text{rel} = 1\\)), \\(y = 2\\): safe (\\(y = 2\\) unsafe only at \\(t_\\text{rel} = 4\\)).\n- At turn 83 (\\(t_\\text{rel} = 2\\)), \\(y = 3\\): safe (\\(y = 3\\) unsafe only at \\(t_\\text{rel} = 4\\)).\n- At turn 84 (\\(t_\\text{rel} = 3\\)), \\(y = 4\\): safe (\\(y = 4\\) unsafe only at \\(t_\\text{rel} = 0\\)).\n- At turn 85 (\\(t_\\text{rel} = 4\\)), \\(y = 5\\): safe (\\(y = 5\\) unsafe only at \\(t_\\text{rel} = 0\\)).\n- At turn 86 (\\(t_\\text{rel} = 5\\)), \\(y = 6\\): safe (\\(y = 6\\) unsafe at \\(t_\\text{rel} = 6, 7\\)).\n- At turn 87 (\\(t_\\text{rel} = 6\\)), \\(y = 7\\): safe (\\(y = 7\\) unsafe only at \\(t_\\text{rel} = 0\\)).\n- At turn 88 (\\(t_\\text{rel} = 7\\)), \\(y = 8\\): safe (\\(y = 8\\) unsafe at \\(t_\\text{rel} = 14\\) to \\(17\\)).\n- At turn 89 (\\(t_\\text{rel} = 8\\)), \\(y = 9\\): safe (no cars).\n\nThus, \\(H = 9\\) is minimal, and the action sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 81: U \\\\\nTurn 82: U \\\\\nTurn 83: U \\\\\nTurn 84: U \\\\\nTurn 85: U \\\\\nTurn 86: U \\\\\nTurn 87: U \\\\\nTurn 88: U \\\\\nTurn 89: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, with y clamped between 0 and 9.\n\nThe cars are on specific freeways, and I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at position 0 at that turn. The collision rule says: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in the car's span at that turn for the freeway y_T. And importantly, if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not considered on that new y until the next turn, so I only care about the freeway I'm currently on when I'm there.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t_1 = 82. I start at y=2.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. For each car, I have its position at turn t_1=82, and I need to compute where it will be at future turns.\n\nThe car update: for left-moving cars, span at T is [h - s*(T - t_1), τ - s*(T - t_1)], and for right-moving, [τ + s*(T - t_1), h + s*(T - t_1)]. The head and tail are given, so for left-moving, h is the right end, I assume, since it's moving left, so as time increases, both decrease. Similarly for right-moving, head is left end, I think.\n\nIn the description:\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nSince it's left-moving, h should be the right end, τ the left end? But it says [h, τ], which might imply h < τ or something. I think I need to interpret the head and tail.\n\nLook at the car state: for example, freeway 1: (96, 49, right, 48). Since direction is right, and it's (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, head is the front, I think, so when moving right, head increases.\n\nIn the update: for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\n\nBut τ and h are given. For freeway 1: (96, 49, right, 48). If head is 96, tail is 49, and direction right, so at T, it becomes [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [49 + 48 Δt, 96 + 48 Δt], so the span moves right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 4: (-60, -25, left, 36), Span(T) = [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] = [-60 - 36 Δt, -25 - 36 Δt], so it moves left.\n\nNow, collision happens at turn T if the player is on freeway k, and for that car on k, 0 is in the span at T.\n\nAlso, multiple cars per freeway, so I need to check all cars on that freeway.\n\nPlayer position: at each turn, I am on a certain y, and I need that at that turn, for that y, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nWhen I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I perform action a_T to go to y_{T+1}. But for collision, it's based on y_T at turn T.\n\nFrom the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut for the current position, at turn T, I am on y_T, so I need to check cars on y_T for 0 in span at T.\n\nIf I stay or move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I care about cars on row y_T at time T.\n\nThen after action, I go to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nSo to avoid collision, for each turn T when I am on freeway k (y from 1 to 8), I need that for all cars on k, 0 is not in their span at turn T.\n\nFor y=0 and y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible. I start at y=2, which has cars? Freeway y=1 to 8 have cars, but y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, y=9 is the top, I think y=0 and y=9 are not freeways with cars; only y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nThe vertical axis is y=0 to 9, and freeways are y=1 to 8 for cars.\n\nSo positions y=0 and y=9 are safe; no cars there.\n\nI start at (0,2), so y=2, which is freeway 2? Freeway k corresponds to y=k, I assume.\n\nThe freeway is given as k, and y=k, so freeway 1 is y=1, freeway 2 is y=2, etc.\n\nIn the player position, it's (0, y), so y is the row.\n\nAt turn t_1=82, I am at y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince I can move up or down, but to minimize turns, I probably want to go up directly, but I have to avoid the cars on y=2 to y=8.\n\ny=9 is safe, so once I reach y=9, I'm done.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9 at some turn, and for the turns when I'm on y=1 to 8, I need no collision.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to know when it is safe to be on that row, meaning that at that turn, 0 is not occupied by any car on that row.\n\nFor each row k, and for each turn T, I can compute if position 0 is occupied by any car on row k at turn T.\n\nIf not, then it's safe to be on row k at turn T.\n\nThen, I need a path from y=2 at time t_1=82 to y=9 at some time, with minimal turns, by changing y by -1, 0, or +1 each turn, and for each position and time, it must be safe.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are always safe, I can use them.\n\nBut starting from y=2, I need to get to y=9.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their spans over time.\n\nLet Δt = T - t_1 = T - 82, for future turns.\n\nFor each car, I need the span at time T.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): one car: (96, 49, right, 48)\n\nSince right-moving, span at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [49 + 48 Δt, 96 + 48 Δt]\n\nCollision if 0 in [49 + 48 Δt, 96 + 48 Δt] for some Δt.\n\nBut since the car is moving right, and starts at 49 to 96, both positive, and increasing, so for Δt >=0, the left end is 49 + 48Δt which is increasing from 49, so always greater than 0, so 0 is never in the span. 49 + 48*0 = 49 >0, and increasing, so 0 < left end, so not in span. So on freeway 1, it's always safe? But there might be other cars.\n\nOnly one car on freeway 1, and it's always to the right of 0, moving away, so yes, for all T, 0 not in span, so row y=1 is always safe.\n\nIs that right? Span at T: [49 + 48Δt, 96 + 48Δt], min is 49 at Δt=0, which is >0, so yes, 0 never in [left, right] since left >=49 >0.\n\nSo freeway 1 is always safe.\n\nBut let's confirm the car: head=96, tail=49, so at t1, from 49 to 96, and moving right, so position 0 is left of tail, so never occupied. Yes.\n\nNow freeway 2 (y=2): two cars: (-36, -47, right, 12) and (36, 25, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, so span at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-47 + 12 Δt, -36 + 12 Δt]\n\nh and τ: given as (-36, -47), so I think head is -36, tail is -47. Since moving right, head is the front, so tail should be less than head.\n\n-47 < -36, so tail = -47, head = -36.\n\nSo span at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-47 + 12 Δt, -36 + 12 Δt]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (36, 25, right, 12), head=36, tail=25, so span at T: [25 + 12 Δt, 36 + 12 Δt]\n\nNow, for freeway 2, collision if 0 in first car's span or second car's span at time T.\n\nFirst car span: [-47 + 12 Δt, -36 + 12 Δt]\n\nSet left = -47 + 12 Δt, right = -36 + 12 Δt\n\n0 in span if left <= 0 <= right.\n\nSimilarly for second car: left2 = 25 + 12 Δt, right2 = 36 + 12 Δt\n\nSince left2 =25 +12Δt >=25>0 for Δt>=0, so right2 > left2 >0, so 0 < left2, not in span. So second car never at 0.\n\nOnly first car can have 0 in span.\n\nFirst car: -47 + 12 Δt <= 0 <= -36 + 12 Δt\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst, -47 + 12 Δt <= 0 => 12 Δt <= 47 => Δt <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so Δt <= 3 since integer? Δt is integer, turns are discrete.\n\nT and t_1 are integers, I assume, since turns.\n\nt_1=82, T is integer, so Δt integer.\n\nSo -47 + 12 Δt <= 0 => 12 Δt <= 47 => Δt <= 47/12 = 3.916, so Δt <= 3\n\nAnd 0 <= -36 + 12 Δt => 12 Δt >= 36 => Δt >= 3\n\nSo for Δt=3, left = -47 +12*3 = -47+36= -11, right= -36+36=0\n\nSo at Δt=3, span is [-11, 0], so 0 is included, since right end is 0.\n\n0 <= right, and left <=0, so yes, 0 is in span.\n\nSimilarly, for Δt=2: left= -47+24= -23, right= -36+24= -12, both negative, so 0 not in [-23,-12]\n\nΔt=4: left= -47+48=1, right= -36+48=12, both positive, 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo only at Δt=3, 0 is in span for first car.\n\nΔt=3, T=82+3=85.\n\nNow second car never, so on freeway 2, unsafe only at T=85 (Δt=3)\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nNow freeway 3 (y=3): same as freeway 2? Cars: (-36, -47, right, 12) and (36, 25, right, 12)\n\nExactly the same as freeway 2.\n\nSo similarly, unsafe only at T=85.\n\nNow freeway 4 (y=4): one car: (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so span at T: [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] = [-60 - 36 Δt, -25 - 36 Δt]\n\nh and τ: given (-60, -25), direction left, so head is -60? But moving left, so head should be the front when moving left.\n\nIn update: for left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nGiven (head, tail, dir, speed) = (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nSince moving left, I think head is the right end, tail left end, but let's see values: -60 and -25, -60 < -25, so if head is -60, tail -25, but moving left, head decreasing.\n\nAt T, [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] = [-60 -36 Δt, -25 -36 Δt]\n\nSince -60 < -25, and both decreasing, so the span is from left to right? [h -sΔt, τ -sΔt] with h=-60, τ=-25, so left end h -sΔt = -60 -36Δt, right end τ -sΔt = -25 -36Δt.\n\nSince -60 -36Δt < -25 -36Δt for all Δt, so the interval is [left, right] with left < right.\n\nCollision if 0 in [left, right], i.e., -60 -36Δt <= 0 <= -25 -36Δt\n\nBut -25 -36Δt <= -25 <0 for Δt>=0, so 0 <= right is false since right <= -25 <0, so 0 > right, not in span. Left is more negative, so 0 not in interval because right end is always negative.\n\nFor example, at Δt=0, span [-60, -25], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nAt any Δt, τ -sΔt = -25 -36Δt <= -25 <0, and h -sΔt = -60 -36Δt <0, so span entirely negative, 0 not in. So always safe for freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 (y=5): same car, (-60, -25, left, 36), so same as above, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 6 (y=6): one car: (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nDirection right, so span at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-41 + 6 Δt, -30 + 6 Δt]\n\nHead and tail: (-30, -41), so head=-30, tail=-41, since moving right, tail < head.\n\nSpan: [-41 + 6 Δt, -30 + 6 Δt]\n\nCollision if 0 in this interval: -41 + 6 Δt <= 0 <= -30 + 6 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -41 + 6 Δt <= 0 => 6 Δt <= 41 => Δt <= 41/6 ≈ 6.833, so Δt <=6\n\nSecond: 0 <= -30 + 6 Δt => 6 Δt >=30 => Δt >=5\n\nSo for Δt=5: left= -41+30= -11, right= -30+30=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nΔt=6: left= -41+36= -5, right= -30+36=6, [ -5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔt=7: left= -41+42=1, right= -30+42=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe when Δt=5 and 6, i.e., T=82+5=87 and 82+6=88.\n\nNow freeway 7 (y=7): two cars: (60, 49, right, 4) and (12, 1, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: (60,49, right,4), head=60, tail=49, span [49 + 4 Δt, 60 + 4 Δt]\n\nBoth positive and increasing, min 49>0, so never 0 in span.\n\nSecond car: (12,1, right,4), head=12, tail=1, span [1 + 4 Δt, 12 + 4 Δt]\n\nMin 1>0, so always positive, 0 not in span.\n\nThus, both cars safe always, so freeway 7 always safe.\n\nNow freeway 8 (y=8): one car: (-39, -50, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, so span [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-50 + 3 Δt, -39 + 3 Δt]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-50 + 3 Δt, -39 + 3 Δt]\n\nSo -50 + 3 Δt <= 0 <= -39 + 3 Δt\n\nFirst: -50 + 3 Δt <= 0 => 3 Δt <=50 => Δt <= 50/3 ≈16.666, Δt <=16\n\nSecond: 0 <= -39 + 3 Δt => 3 Δt >=39 => Δt >=13\n\nSo for Δt from 13 to 16 inclusive.\n\nAt Δt=13: left= -50+39= -11, right= -39+39=0, [ -11,0], 0 in\n\nΔt=14: left= -50+42= -8, right= -39+42=3, [ -8,3], 0 in\n\nΔt=15: left= -50+45= -5, right= -39+45=6, [ -5,6], 0 in\n\nΔt=16: left= -50+48= -2, right= -39+48=9, [ -2,9], 0 in\n\nΔt=17: left= -50+51=1, right= -39+51=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo unsafe for Δt=13,14,15,16, T=82+13=95 to 82+16=98.\n\nNow, summarize safe rows over time:\n\n- y=1: always safe\n\n- y=2: safe except T=85 (unsafe)\n\n- y=3: safe except T=85 (unsafe)\n\n- y=4: always safe\n\n- y=5: always safe\n\n- y=6: unsafe at T=87,88\n\n- y=7: always safe\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=95 to 98\n\nAlso, y=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nI start at t=82, y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9 asap.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, I can go directly up if possible.\n\nBut I have to go through rows, and avoid unsafe times.\n\nAt t=82, I am at y=2. y=2 is safe at t=82, since unsafe only at t=85.\n\nΔt=0, T=82, for y=2, we have unsafe only at Δt=3, T=85, so at T=82, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can stay or move.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should go up when possible.\n\nBut let's see the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, direct path: from y=2 to y=9, I need to go up 7 times, so at least 7 turns if I go up each turn.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down to avoid unsafe times.\n\nSince y=4,5,7 are always safe, I can use them.\n\ny=1,4,5,7 always safe.\n\ny=2 and 3 unsafe only at t=85.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=87,88.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=95-98, which is later, might not affect if I go fast.\n\nt=95 is far, since t=82 now, Δt=13, so if I can reach before t=95, I might avoid y=8 unsafe.\n\nBut y=8 unsafe starts at t=95, which is 13 turns from now.\n\nTo go from y=2 to y=9, min 7 turns, so by t=89, I could be at y=9 if I go up each turn.\n\nt=82 to t=89 is 7 turns, y from 2 to 9.\n\nNow, check if I can do that without collision.\n\nStart at t=82, y=2: safe, as above.\n\nAction: go up to y=3 at next turn.\n\nAt turn t=82, I am at y=2, perform action to go to y_{83}.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn T: position y_T, action a_T to determine y_{T+1}\n\nAt T=t_1=82, I am at y=2.\n\nI choose a_{82}, which sets y_{83} = y_82 + Δy.\n\nThen at T=83, I am at y_83, and so on.\n\nFor collision: at each T, when I am at y_T, it must be safe for that T.\n\nStart: T=82, y=2, safe.\n\nNow, I want to go to y=9 quickly.\n\nSuppose I go up each turn.\n\nAt T=82, a=U, so y_{83} = 3.\n\nThen at T=83, I am at y=3.\n\nNow, y=3 at T=83: unsafe only at T=85, so at T=83, safe? T=83, Δt=83-82=1, for y=3, unsafe at Δt=3, T=85, so at T=83, Δt=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly, a=U, y_{84}=4.\n\nT=84, y=4, which is always safe, so safe.\n\na=U, y_{85}=5.\n\nNow T=85, y=5? At T=85, I am at y=5.\n\ny=5 is always safe, as per above.\n\nBut y=3 is unsafe at T=85, but I am not on y=3 at T=85.\n\nAt T=85, I am at y=5 if I went up.\n\nSequence:\n\nT=82: y=2, a=U → y=3 at T=83\n\nT=83: y=3, a=U → y=4 at T=84\n\nT=84: y=4, a=U → y=5 at T=85\n\nT=85: y=5, now y=5 is always safe, so no issue.\n\nThen a=U, y_{86}=6\n\nT=86: y=6, now y=6 unsafe at T=87 and 88, but T=86, Δt=86-82=4, for y=6, unsafe at Δt=5,6 T=87,88, so at T=86, Δt=4, safe.\n\nΔt=4, T=86, for y=6, we had unsafe at Δt=5,6, so at Δt=4, safe.\n\nThen at T=86, y=6, safe, a=U → y=7 at T=87\n\nBut T=87: y=7, now y=7 is always safe, so safe.\n\nThen a=U → y=8 at T=88\n\nT=88: y=8, now y=8 unsafe at T=95-98, but T=88, Δt=6, unsafe starts at Δt=13, T=95, so at T=88, safe.\n\nThen a=U → y=9 at T=89\n\nT=89: y=9, which is safe, and I reached y=9.\n\nNow, I started at T=82, y=2, after actions at T=82 to T=88, I reach y=9 at T=89.\n\nNumber of turns: from T=82 to T=89, that's 8 turns, but I performed actions from t=82 to t=88, 7 actions, and at T=89 I am at y=9.\n\nLet's list:\n\n- T=82: at y=2, action U → to y=3 at next turn\n\n- T=83: at y=3, action U → to y=4\n\n- T=84: at y=4, action U → to y=5\n\n- T=85: at y=5, action U → to y=6\n\n- T=86: at y=6, action U → to y=7\n\n- T=87: at y=7, action U → to y=8\n\n- T=88: at y=8, action U → to y=9\n\nNow at T=89, I am at y=9.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn, and since y=9 is safe, I can stop after the last action that brings me to y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=88, I perform U to go to y=9, so at T=89 I am at y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think from t_1 to t_1+H-1, so T from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nStart at T=t_1=82, after H actions, I reach at T=t_1 + H.\n\nBut the position is reached at turn t_1 + H.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t to t+H-1, position at t+H.\n\nIn this case, to reach at T=89, which is t_1 +7, since 82+7=89.\n\nt_1=82, T=89, ΔT=7.\n\nActions from t=82 to t=88, that's 7 actions.\n\nNow, check safety at each step:\n\n- T=82, y=2: safe (unsafe only at T=85)\n\n- T=83, y=3: safe (unsafe only at T=85)\n\n- T=84, y=4: always safe\n\n- T=85, y=5: always safe\n\n- T=86, y=6: safe, since unsafe at T=87,88, not 86\n\n- T=87, y=7: always safe\n\n- T=88, y=8: safe, since unsafe starts at T=95\n\n- Then at T=89, y=9: safe\n\nAll good, and no collision.\n\nBut at T=87, I am at y=7, which is safe, and I go to y=8 at T=88.\n\ny=6 was unsafe at T=87 and 88, but at T=87, I was on y=7, not y=6.\n\nAt T=87, y=7, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=88, y=8, safe.\n\nSo this seems fine.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? Min turns is 7, since from 2 to 9, difference 7, so at least 7 actions if going up each time.\n\nCan I do it in less? Only if I start at higher y, but I start at 2, so no, min 7 actions.\n\nBut with stay or down, it would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nIn this case, with direct up, it works.\n\nBut let me confirm y=6 at T=86: safe, yes.\n\ny=8 at T=88: safe, yes.\n\nUnsafe times: y=6 unsafe at T=87,88, but I was at y=6 at T=86, which is safe, and at T=87 I was at y=7.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 unsafe late.\n\nBut in the sequence, I passed y=6 at T=86, which is before the unsafe time.\n\nT=86 is safe for y=6.\n\nNow, but I need to output the actions.\n\nBut the player position is given as (0,y), but since x is always 0, I think we only care about y.\n\nNow, the answer should be a sequence of actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nH=7 actions, from t=82 to 88.\n\nActions: all U, I think.\n\nBut let me write the sequence.\n\nTurn 82: a_{82} = U\n\nTurn 83: a_{83} = U\n\nTurn 84: a_{84} = U\n\nTurn 85: a_{85} = U\n\nTurn 86: a_{86} = U\n\nTurn 87: a_{87} = U\n\nTurn 88: a_{88} = U\n\nThen at turn 89, y=9.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nAt T=85, I was at y=5, which is safe, but y=2 and y=3 are unsafe at T=85, but I was not there.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on y=6.\n\nFreeway 6: at T=86, Δt=4, span [-41 +6*4, -30 +6*4] = [-41+24, -30+24] = [-17, -6], both negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt T=87, Δt=5, [-41+30, -30+30] = [-11,0], 0 in, unsafe, but I was at y=7 at T=87.\n\nSimilarly, T=88, y=6 unsafe, but I was at y=8? At T=88, I was at y=8.\n\nIn sequence, at T=87, y=7; T=88, y=8.\n\ny=6 unsafe at T=87 and 88, but I wasn't there.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut I could go faster? No, 7 is minimum.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier, but start at t=82, y=2, after 6 actions, I would be at y=8, but y=8 at T=88, which is safe, but I need to be at y=9.\n\nAfter 6 actions: from t=82 to t=87 actions, position at t=88.\n\nt=82 action to y_{83}, ..., after a_{87}, y_{88}.\n\ny_{88} could be 8, then at T=88 I am at y=8, not 9 yet.\n\nThen I need another action to go to y=9 at T=89.\n\nSo minimum 7 actions to reach y=9.\n\nIf I go up faster, but I can only change by 1 each turn, so yes.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, I used all U.\n\nBut is y=5 always safe? Yes.\n\ny=7 always safe.\n\nIn the car list, freeway 5 has car, but we said it's always safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 7: always safe, yes.\n\nNow, but the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nH=7, so turns 82 to 88.\n\nActions all U.\n\nBut perhaps I need to write it.\n\nBut let me see if there is a reason to not go directly.\n\nFor example, at T=85, if I were on y=2 or 3, it would be unsafe, but I am on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=0 or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=0, then up, but that would be longer.\n\nNot necessary.\n\nSo minimal H is 7.\n\nBut let me check if at any point I must wait.\n\nFor example, if at T=86, y=6 was unsafe, but it is safe at T=86.\n\nIn this case, it works.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, but unsafe late.\n\nAnother thing: I need to reach (0,9), and I do.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 2 and 3 have cars, but we handled.\n\nPerhaps I should output the sequence.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nSo H=7, actions from t=82 to 88 all U.\n\nBut in the format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  // which is a_{82}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H-1 = 82 + 6 = 88? H=7, t_1 to t_1 + H-1 is 7 turns: 82,83,84,85,86,87,88.\n\nYes.\n\nActions: all U.\n\nBut let me write:\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nThen at turn 89, position y=9.\n\nBut is there a car on y=8 at earlier time? No, unsafe only from t=95.\n\nBut in the sequence, at T=88, I am at y=8, which is safe.\n\nPerhaps I can do it in fewer actions by staying or something, but no, staying would not reduce H.\n\nFor example, if I stay at some point, y doesn't increase, so it takes more turns to reach 9.\n\nSo minimal is 7 with all up.\n\nBut let me confirm the starting point.\n\nAt t=82, y=2, safe.\n\nAfter U, to y=3 at t=83.\n\nt=83 y=3 safe.\n\nU to y=4 at t=84.\n\nt=84 y=4 safe.\n\nU to y=5 at t=85.\n\nt=85 y=5 safe.\n\nU to y=6 at t=86.\n\nt=86 y=6: Δt=4, span [-41+24, -30+24]=[-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nU to y=7 at t=87.\n\nt=87 y=7: always safe.\n\nU to y=8 at t=88.\n\nt=88 y=8: Δt=6, for y=8, span [-50 + 3*6, -39 + 3*6] = [-50+18, -39+18] = [-32, -21], both negative, 0 not in, safe. Since unsafe starts at Δt=13.\n\nThen U to y=9 at t=89.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier? No.\n\nAnother path: for example, go to y=1, but y=1 is safe, but lower, so it would take more turns to go up to 9.\n\nNot better.\n\nOr stay, worse.\n\nSo this is minimal.\n\nBut in freeway 2, there is a car that is unsafe at t=85, but I am not there.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo the minimal H is 7, with all up actions.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut the output should be the sequence of actions for each turn.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 82: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 83: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 84: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: & U \\end{array} }\n\nIn text, but since it's a box, probably fine.\n\nSince the problem says \"a sequence of actions\", and \"answer format\" shows multiple lines.\n\nBut in the box.\n\nPerhaps I should write it as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\netc.\n\nIn the problem: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo I think:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 82: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 83: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 84: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: U }\n\nBut need to make sure the syntax.\n\nSince it's in a box, and multiple lines.\n\nPerhaps I can write it as a list.\n\nBut I think it's clear.\n\nBut let me see if H can be less, but no.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 faster by going to safe rows.\n\nBut all up works.\n\nAnother thing: at T=86, y=6 is safe, but if I were later, it might not be, but in this case, it is.\n\nSuppose I stay at y=5 for one turn, then go up, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, at T=85, y=5, if I stay, y=5 at T=86, then go to y=6 at T=87, but at T=87, y=6 is unsafe, so I cannot be on y=6 at T=87.\n\nIn my sequence, I go to y=6 at T=86, which is safe, and then to y=7 at T=87.\n\nIf I stay at y=5 at T=85, then at T=86 I am still y=5, then I need to go to y=6 at some point.\n\nBut at T=86, if I go U, to y=6 at T=87.\n\nBut at T=87, y=6 is unsafe, so I cannot be on y=6 at T=87.\n\nIf I stay at y=5 at T=86, then at T=87 I am y=5, then I can go to y=6 at T=88, but at T=88, y=6 is also unsafe, so I cannot be on y=6 at T=88 either.\n\nThen I have to wait until T=89 to go to y=6, which is safe at T=89, since unsafe only at 87,88.\n\nAt T=89, y=6: Δt=7, span [-41+42, -30+42]=[1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen I can go to y=7 at T=90, etc., but it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, from t=82 to t=85: at y=5, then if I stay at t=85, a=S, then at T=86 y=5, then I cannot go to y=6 immediately because next turns unsafe.\n\nAt T=86, if I go U, to y=6 at T=87, but T=87 y=6 unsafe.\n\nIf I go U at T=86, I am at y=6 at T=87, which is unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at T=86, a=S, then at T=87 y=5, then at T=87, I can go to y=6 only at T=88, but T=88 y=6 unsafe.\n\nSo I must stay until T=88, then at T=88, I am y=5, go U to y=6 at T=89.\n\nThen at T=89 y=6, safe.\n\nThen go to y=7 at T=90, etc.\n\nBut this takes longer: from start, to reach y=9, I need more turns.\n\nFor example, from t=82: U to y=3 at 83, U to y=4 at 84, U to y=5 at 85.\n\nThen at t=85, if S, then at T=86 y=5.\n\nThen at t=86, S or something, but to avoid y=6 at 87 and 88.\n\nAt T=86, I can go directly to y=7? No, I can only change by 1, so from y=5, I can only go to y=4,5,6.\n\nI cannot skip rows.\n\nSo I must pass through y=6 to go to y=7.\n\nBut y=6 is unsafe at T=87 and 88, so I need to be on y=6 at a safe time, like T=86 or T=89.\n\nT=86 is safe, as in my sequence.\n\nIf I miss T=86, next safe is T=89.\n\nThen I have to wait.\n\nIn my sequence, I used T=86 which is safe.\n\nIf I go slower, I might hit unsafe times.\n\nBut in this case, with direct up, I avoid all unsafe times.\n\ny=8 unsafe late, not an issue.\n\nSo I think my sequence is correct.\n\nThus, minimal H=7 with all U actions.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 82\\) is 7.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 83, and I start at y=3. Each turn, I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but I have to stay within 0 to 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T, and for the car on that freeway, 0 is within its span at that exact turn. The note says that if I move to a different y, I'm not considered on that new row until the next turn, so I only check the car on the row I'm currently on.\n\nFirst, I need to understand where the cars are at each turn relative to t=83. The car positions are given at t=83, and they move linearly with their speed.\n\nLet me denote the time elapsed from t_1 as τ = T - t_1, so at τ=0, it's turn 83.\n\nFor each car, the span at time τ is:\n\n- For left-moving cars: [h - s*τ, τ - s*τ] but tail is τ, I think. Let's see the notation.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, it says \"head h, tail τ\", so for left-moving, head is at a higher x, I assume, but since they're moving left, x decreases.\n\nBut collision depends on whether 0 is in the span at time T.\n\nSince the player is at x=0 always, I think, because it's a vertical movement, and cars are on horizontal freeways.\n\nThe player is at (0, y_t), so x=0 fixed, y changes.\n\nCars are on rows y=1 to 8, and for each row, if I'm on that row at time T, and 0 is in the car's span at that time, I collide.\n\nNow, for each freeway and each car, I need to find when 0 is in their span as a function of τ.\n\nLet τ = T - t_1, so τ=0 is now.\n\nFor each car, at τ, the span is:\n\n- If direction is right: span is [τ + s*τ, h + s*τ]? No.\n\nLet's use the given.\n\nFor a car with head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nAt time T, span:\n\nIf d = left: [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\n\nBut since it's moving left, the head is decreasing.\n\nSimilarly, d = right: [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nAnd tail τ, but in the notation, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" so τ is tail, h is head, so for right-moving, tail at left, head at right, so as time increases, both increase.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head at left? No.\n\nLet's clarify the coordinate.\n\nI think x increases to the right, so for a car moving right, at time t_1, tail at position τ, head at position h, with h > τ since it's moving right, so span [τ, h].\n\nThen at time T, position: tail at τ + s*(T-t_1), head at h + s*(T-t_1), so span [τ + s*τ, h + s*τ] where τ = T-t_1.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: at t_1, head at h, tail at τ, but since moving left, head should be at higher x? No, if moving left, the front is decreasing.\n\nThe notation says for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and then Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\n\nBut if it's moving left, and [h, τ], if h and τ are positions, which one is larger?\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48) — but -48 and -95, -48 > -95, so if right-moving, tail at -95, head at -48? But tail should be left, head right.\n\n-95 is less than -48, so tail at -95, head at -48, both to the left of zero, moving right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36), 48 and 83, 48<83, so head at 83, tail at 48? But moving left, so head at higher x decreasing.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, it's [h, τ] at t_1, but in this case for freeway 4, h=48, τ=83? 48 and 83, but 48<83, so if [h,τ] = [48,83], that means from 48 to 83, but moving left, so head at 83, tail at 48, so as it moves left, head decreases.\n\nAt T, span [48 - sτ, 83 - sτ] for τ= T-t_1.\n\nBut 48 - sτ and 83 - sτ, since s>0, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ + sτ, h + sτ] with τ being the tail at t_1.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's use the given notation.\n\nLet τ = T - t_1.\n\nFor each car, I need to find for which τ, 0 is in the span at that τ.\n\nThat is, for a car on freeway k, at time τ, if I am on row k at that time, and 0 is in [low, high] for that car.\n\nBut there might be multiple cars on a row, so I need to avoid 0 being in any of their spans when I'm on that row.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h=-48, tail τ=-95, direction right, speed s=48. So at τ=0, span [ -95, -48 ]\n\nAt time τ, span for this car: since right-moving, [ τ + s τ, h + s τ ] = [ -95 + 48 τ, -48 + 48 τ ]\n\nτ is T-t_1, so let's use t for τ.\n\nSo span: [ -95 + 48t, -48 + 48t ]\n\n0 is in this if -95 + 48t <= 0 <= -48 + 48t\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars: (-24, -35, right, 12) and (48, 37, right, 12)? Head and tail.\n\nFirst car: tail τ=-35, head h=-24, right, s=12. So span at t: [ -35 + 12t, -24 + 12t ]\n\nSecond car: (48, 37, right, 12) — head 48, tail 37? But 37<48, so tail 37, head 48, span at t: [37 + 12t, 48 + 12t]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? It says (-24, -35, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12) — identical to freeway 2? But different row, I think.\n\nFreeway 3 has the same cars? No, it's listed separately, so probably different freeways.\n\nFreeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36) — head h=48, tail τ=83? But for left-moving, span at t_1 is [h, τ] = [48,83], so head at 48, tail at 83? But 48<83, so from 48 to 83, moving left.\n\nAt time t, span [48 - 36t, 83 - 36t]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as freeway 4? (48, 83, left, 36) identical.\n\nFreeway 6: (-24, -35, right, 6) — one car, tail -35, head -24, right, s=6, span at t: [-35 +6t, -24 +6t]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 4) and (16, 5, right, 4)? Head and tail.\n\nFirst car: tail -59, head -48, right, s=4, span: [-59 +4t, -48 +4t]\n\nSecond car: (16,5, right,4) — tail 5, head 16, span: [5+4t, 16+4t]\n\nBut tail 5, head 16, both positive.\n\nFreeway 8: (-36, -47, right, 3) — tail -47, head -36, right, s=3, span: [-47 +3t, -36 +3t]\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nSince I need to go from y=3 to y=9, and I start at y=3 at t=83 (τ=0).\n\nI need to reach y=9, so I must increase y by 6, so minimum turns if I go up every time is 6 turns, but I might have to wait or go around cars.\n\nSince I can only change y by 1 each turn, and I start at 3, end at 9, I need to go up at least 6 times, no down, so actions must include at least 6 U, and possibly some S or D, but D would make me go down, which might be necessary to avoid, but since I need to go up, D might not help, or I could go down to avoid a car and come back, but that would take more turns, so for minimal turns, I probably don't want to go down, only U and S.\n\nSimilarly, staying might be necessary to wait for a gap.\n\nBut let's see the cars.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the intervals of t where it is unsafe to be on that row.\n\nThat is, for each row y=1 to 8, find set of t where 0 is in some car's span on that row.\n\nt here is τ, time since t_1=83.\n\nStart with y=1: only one car, (-48,-95,right,48)\n\nSpan at t: [-95 +48t, -48 +48t]\n\n0 in this if -95 +48t <= 0 <= -48 +48t\n\nWhich is 48t <= 48 and 48t >= 95? Let's solve:\n\n-95 +48t <= 0 => 48t <= 95 => t <= 95/48 = 1.979...\n\n0 <= -48 +48t => 48t >= 48 => t >= 1\n\nSo t >=1 and t <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979\n\nSince t is integer (turns), t=1 or 2? t=1: 48*1=48, -48+48=0, so 0 <=0 is true, and -95+48= -47 <=0, yes.\n\nt=2: -95+96=1, which is >0, and -48+96=48>0, but 0 <=48 true, but -95+96=1 <=0? 1 <=0 false, so only when low <=0 and high >=0.\n\nAt t=1: low = -95+48= -47 <=0, high= -48+48=0 >=0, so 0 in [-47,0], yes.\n\nAt t=2: low = -95+96=1 >0, high=48>0, so 0 not in [1,48], no.\n\nAt t=0: low=-95<0, high=-48<0, 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe only at t=1.\n\nt=1, which is τ=1, time T=84.\n\nNow y=2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,12), span: [-35 +12t, -24 +12t]\n\n0 in this if -35+12t <=0 <= -24+12t\n\nSo 12t <=35 => t <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916\n\nAnd 12t >=24 => t >=2\n\nSo t>=2 and t<=2.916, so t=2 or 3? t=2: low=-35+24= -11 <=0, high=-24+24=0 >=0, yes.\n\nt=3: low=-35+36=1 >0, high= -24+36=12>0, 0 not in [1,12], no.\n\nt=1: low=-35+12=-23<0, high=-24+12=-12<0, no.\n\nSo unsafe at t=2.\n\nSecond car on y=2: (48,37,right,12) — tail 37, head 48, span: [37+12t, 48+12t]\n\nAt t=0, [37,48], both positive, so 0 not in, and as t increases, it moves right, so always positive, never contains 0. So safe for all t.\n\nThus for y=2, only unsafe when first car has 0, at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=3: same as y=2? Freeway 3 has same cars: (-24,-35,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nFirst car same as above, unsafe at t=2.\n\nSecond car never unsafe.\n\nSo y=3 unsafe at t=2.\n\nBut I start at y=3, t=0 (τ=0).\n\nAt t=0, on y=3, is it unsafe?\n\nAt t=0, for first car, span [-35,-24], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [37,48], positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo at t=0, y=3 is safe.\n\nUnsafe only at t=2.\n\nNow y=4: cars (48,83,left,36)\n\nHead 48, tail 83? For left-moving, at t_1, [h,τ] = [48,83], so at time t, [48-36t, 83-36t]\n\n0 in this if 48-36t <= 0 <= 83-36t\n\nSo 48-36t <=0 => 36t >=48 => t >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333\n\nAnd 0 <= 83-36t => 36t <=83 => t <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSo t from 1.333 to 2.305, so t=2 since integer.\n\nt=1: 48-36=12 >0? low=48-36t, at t=1: 48-36=12, high=83-36=47, both >0, so 0 not <=12? 0 <=12 true, but low=12 <=0? 12<=0 false, so not in.\n\n0 in [low, high] if low <=0 and high >=0.\n\nAt t=1: low=12 >0, high=47>0, so low>0, not <=0, so false.\n\nAt t=2: low=48-72= -24 <=0, high=83-72=11 >=0, yes.\n\nAt t=3: low=48-108= -60<0, high=83-108= -25<0, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=5: same as y=4, (48,83,left,36), so unsafe at t=2.\n\nNow y=6: one car (-24,-35,right,6), span: [-35+6t, -24+6t]\n\n0 in this if -35+6t <=0 <= -24+6t\n\n6t <=35 => t <= 35/6 ≈5.833\n\n6t >=24 => t >=4\n\nSo t from 4 to 5.833, t=4,5.\n\nt=4: low=-35+24= -11 <=0, high=-24+24=0 >=0, yes.\n\nt=5: low=-35+30= -5 <=0, high=-24+30=6 >=0, yes.\n\nt=6: low=-35+36=1>0, high=12>0, no.\n\nSo unsafe at t=4 and t=5.\n\nNow y=7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4), span: [-59+4t, -48+4t]\n\n0 in this if -59+4t <=0 <= -48+4t\n\n4t <=59 => t <=59/4=14.75\n\n4t >=48 => t >=12\n\nSo t from 12 to 14.75, t=12,13,14.\n\nt=12: low=-59+48= -11 <=0, high=-48+48=0 >=0, yes.\n\nt=13: low=-59+52= -7 <=0, high=-48+52=4 >=0, yes.\n\nt=14: low=-59+56= -3 <=0, high=-48+56=8 >=0, yes.\n\nt=15: low= -59+60=1>0, high=12>0, no.\n\nSecond car: (16,5,right,4) — tail 5, head 16, span: [5+4t, 16+4t]\n\nAt t=0, [5,16], min=5>0, so for all t, min=5+4t >=5>0, so never contains 0. Safe.\n\nThus for y=7, unsafe when first car has 0, at t=12,13,14.\n\nNow y=8: one car (-36,-47,right,3), span: [-47+3t, -36+3t]\n\n0 in this if -47+3t <=0 <= -36+3t\n\n3t <=47 => t <= 47/3 ≈15.666\n\n3t >=36 => t >=12\n\nSo t from 12 to 15.666, t=12,13,14,15.\n\nt=12: low=-47+36= -11 <=0, high=-36+36=0 >=0, yes.\n\nt=13: low=-47+39= -8 <=0, high=-36+39=3 >=0, yes.\n\nt=14: low=-47+42= -5 <=0, high=-36+42=6 >=0, yes.\n\nt=15: low=-47+45= -2 <=0, high=-36+45=9 >=0, yes.\n\nt=16: low=-47+48=1>0, high=12>0, no.\n\nSo unsafe at t=12,13,14,15.\n\nNow, summarize unsafe times for each row:\n\ny=1: unsafe at t=1\n\ny=2: unsafe at t=2\n\ny=3: unsafe at t=2  (but safe at t=0,1,3,... except t=2)\n\ny=3 at t=0: safe, as we saw.\n\ny=4: unsafe at t=2\n\ny=5: unsafe at t=2\n\ny=6: unsafe at t=4,5\n\ny=7: unsafe at t=12,13,14\n\ny=8: unsafe at t=12,13,14,15\n\nI start at y=3, t=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9. y=9 is the goal, no cars, so always safe.\n\nBut y=9 is not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 is safe.\n\nNow, the position is (0,9), and since no cars on y=9, I can be there anytime.\n\nBut I need to arrive at y=9 at some turn.\n\nNow, since I start at y=3, I need to go to y=4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nEach step takes one turn.\n\nI need to be on each row at some time without collision.\n\nSince I move one row per turn when I go up, but I can stay or go down.\n\nFor minimal turns, I should go up as much as possible, only stay or go down if necessary to avoid collision.\n\nBut going down might not help for minimal turns, since I have to come back up.\n\nSo probably, only U and S actions.\n\nI need to go from y=3 to y=9, difference 6, so with S actions, it takes more than 6 turns.\n\nMinimal H is at least 6.\n\nCan I do it in 6 turns? That means always go up, no stay.\n\nSo sequence: U,U,U,U,U,U from t=83 to 88, positions:\n\nAt t=83 (τ=0), y=3\n\nAfter action a_t at time t, position at t+1? Let's see the update.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\na_t at turn t, so at turn t, I choose action, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t, I do a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nBut collision is checked at turn T, when I am at position y_T.\n\nDefine the time.\n\nTurn t_1 = 83, position (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,3)\n\nThen I choose action a_{t_1} for turn t_1, which affects y_{t_1 +1}\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, I am at y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T if y_T is between 1 and 8, and 0 in some car span on row y_T at time T.\n\nTime T is the turn number.\n\nIn terms of τ, τ = T - t_1, so at turn T, τ = T - 83.\n\nFor example, at turn 83, τ=0, y=3\n\nAfter a_{83}, y_{84} is set.\n\nThen at turn 84, position y_{84}, and so on.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the cars at time T.\n\nIn the unsafe times above, I used t for τ, so t=0 is turn 83, t=1 is turn 84, etc.\n\nIn the summary, t is τ, turn relative to start.\n\nTurn 83: τ=0\n\nTurn 84: τ=1\n\netc.\n\nUnsafe:\n\ny=1: unsafe at τ=1 (turn 84)\n\ny=2: unsafe at τ=2 (turn 85)\n\ny=3: unsafe at τ=2 (turn 85) — but at τ=0 (turn 83), y=3 is safe.\n\ny=4: unsafe at τ=2 (turn 85)\n\ny=5: unsafe at τ=2 (turn 85)\n\ny=6: unsafe at τ=4 and 5 (turn 87 and 88)\n\ny=7: unsafe at τ=12,13,14 (turn 95,96,97)\n\ny=8: unsafe at τ=12,13,14,15 (turn 95,96,97,98)\n\nNow, I start at τ=0, y=3.\n\nI need to reach y=9 by some τ.\n\nIf I always go up:\n\nStart τ=0, y=3\n\nAfter a_{83}, if U, then at τ=1 (turn 84), y=4\n\nThen a_{84}, if U, at τ=2 (turn 85), y=5\n\nThen a_{85}, if U, at τ=3 (turn 86), y=6\n\nThen a_{86}, if U, at τ=4 (turn 87), y=7\n\nThen a_{87}, if U, at τ=5 (turn 88), y=8\n\nThen a_{88}, if U, at τ=6 (turn 89), y=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt turn 84 (τ=1): y=4\n\ny=4 is row 4, which is unsafe at τ=2? τ=1, is it unsafe?\n\nFor y=4, unsafe only at τ=2, as above.\n\nAt τ=1, y=4: for y=4, cars on row 4, at τ=1, span [48-36*1, 83-36*1] = [12,47], both >0, so 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt turn 85 (τ=2): y=5\n\ny=5, unsafe at τ=2? Yes, as above, at τ=2, for y=5, car span [48-72,83-72]=[-24,11], 0 in, so collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt τ=2, turn 85, if y=5, collision.\n\nIn the sequence above, at τ=2, y=5, which is unsafe.\n\nSo cannot go directly.\n\nAt τ=1, y=4 is safe, but at τ=2, if I go to y=5, it is unsafe.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=5 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=3,4,5 are all unsafe at τ=2? y=3 at τ=2 is unsafe, y=4 at τ=2 unsafe, y=5 at τ=2 unsafe.\n\ny=2 also unsafe at τ=2, but I'm not there.\n\nNow, at τ=1, I could be on y=4 or other.\n\nOptions:\n\nAt τ=0, y=3, safe.\n\nI do a_{83}: possible actions U, D, S.\n\nIf U, to y=4 at τ=1.\n\nIf D, to y=2 at τ=1, but y=2 at τ=1: is it safe?\n\ny=2 unsafe at τ=2, but at τ=1: for y=2, cars: first car span [-35+12*1, -24+12*1] = [-23,-12], both <0, 0 not in. Second car [37+12,48+12]=[49,60]>0, not 0. So safe at τ=1.\n\nBut if I go down to y=2, I have to come back up, which takes extra turns, not good for minimal.\n\nSimilarly, S: stay at y=3 at τ=1.\n\ny=3 at τ=1: is it safe? At τ=1, for y=3, cars same as y=2, first car [-35+12,-24+12]=[-23,-12]<0, not 0. Second car [37+12,48+12]=[49,60]>0, not 0. So safe.\n\nBut at τ=2, y=3 is unsafe.\n\nNow, for minimal turns, I want to go up as much as possible.\n\nI need to be not on y=3,4,5 at τ=2.\n\nBecause all are unsafe at τ=2.\n\ny=3,4,5 all unsafe at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=1, I can be on y=3 or y=4.\n\nIf I am on y=4 at τ=1, I could stay or go up or down.\n\nBut going down not desirable.\n\nIf I go up to y=5 at τ=2, collision.\n\nSo I must not be on y=5 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay at y=4 at τ=1, then at τ=2, if I go to y=5, collision, or if I stay, y=4 at τ=2, collision, or if I go down, to y=3, but y=3 at τ=2 collision.\n\nSo at τ=2, whatever I do on rows 3,4,5, I collide if I am there.\n\nBut I don't have to be there.\n\nAt τ=1, if I am on y=4, I could go down to y=3, but at τ=2 y=3 collision.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAt τ=0, instead of going up, I could stay at y=3 for τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=3 is safe, as above.\n\nThen at τ=1, I am at y=3.\n\nNow, at τ=1, I choose action for turn 84 (τ=1), which sets y_{85}.\n\nIf I go up, to y=4 at τ=2.\n\nBut y=4 at τ=2 is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I stay, y=3 at τ=2, unsafe.\n\nIf I go down, to y=2 at τ=2.\n\ny=2 at τ=2 is unsafe, as per earlier.\n\ny=2 unsafe at τ=2.\n\nSo at τ=2, all y=2,3,4,5 are unsafe.\n\ny=1 at τ=2: is it safe? y=1 unsafe only at τ=1, at τ=2: for y=1, car span [-95+48*2, -48+48*2] = [-95+96, -48+96] = [1,48] >0, 0 not in, so safe at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at τ=2: unsafe at τ=4,5, at τ=2: car [-35+6*2, -24+12] wait, y=6 car: [-35+6t, -24+6t], at t=2: [-35+12, -24+12]=[-23,-12]<0, not 0, so safe.\n\ny=7 and 8 safe at early times.\n\nSo at τ=2, rows y=1,6,7,8 are safe, y=2,3,4,5 unsafe.\n\nBut I am at y=3 at τ=1, and I need to go to higher y.\n\nIf I go down to y=2 at τ=2, but y=2 unsafe at τ=2, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps I should not be at y=3 or y=4 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=0, I could go down to y=2.\n\nAt τ=0, y=3, do D, then at τ=1, y=2.\n\ny=2 at τ=1 is safe, as above.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=2, I can choose action.\n\nIf I go up to y=3 at τ=2, but y=3 unsafe at τ=2, collision.\n\nIf I stay at y=2 at τ=2, unsafe.\n\nIf I go down to y=1 at τ=2.\n\ny=1 at τ=2 is safe, as above.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=1, safe.\n\nBut y=1 is low, and I need to go to y=9, so I have to come up, which will take many turns.\n\nFor example, from y=1 at τ=2, I can go up to y=2 at τ=3, etc.\n\nBut let's see if I can avoid the unsafe times with minimal delay.\n\nThe problem is that at τ=2, rows 2,3,4,5 are all occupied by cars at x=0.\n\nSo I need to not be on those rows at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=1, I can be on y=3 or y=4, both safe at τ=1.\n\nBut from there, at τ=2, I must be on a safe row, which are y=1,6,7,8.\n\nBut from y=3 or y=4, I can only go to y=2,3,4 or y=3,4,5, none of which are safe at τ=2.\n\ny=1,6,7,8 are not adjacent, so I cannot reach them in one step from y=3 or 4.\n\nFor example, from y=4 at τ=1, I can go to y=3,4,5 at τ=2, all unsafe.\n\nSimilarly from y=3, to y=2,3,4, all unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot avoid collision at τ=2 if I am on y=2,3,4,5 at τ=1 or something.\n\nLet's list the positions over time.\n\nDenote the state at time τ, before action or after?\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nBut collision at time T based on y_T.\n\nFor τ=0, turn 83, y=3, safe.\n\nI do a_83.\n\nIf a_83 = S, then at τ=1 (turn 84), y=3, which is safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, I do a_84, which sets y for τ=2.\n\nBut at τ=2, y must be not in {2,3,4,5} to be safe.\n\nPossible y at τ=2: 1,6,7,8.\n\nBut from y=3 at τ=1, with one action, I can go to y=2,3,4.\n\nNone of which are 1,6,7,8. So impossible to reach a safe row at τ=2 from y=3 at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, if at τ=0, I do a_83 = U, then at τ=1, y=4, safe.\n\nThen from y=4 at τ=1, with action, to y=3,4,5 at τ=2, all unsafe.\n\nSame issue.\n\nIf at τ=0, I do a_83 = D, then at τ=1, y=2.\n\ny=2 at τ=1 is safe.\n\nThen from y=2 at τ=1, to y=1,2,3 at τ=2.\n\ny=1 at τ=2 is safe, as we saw.\n\ny=2 and y=3 unsafe.\n\nSo I can go to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nFor example, at τ=1, y=2, do D, to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=1, safe.\n\nBut now I am at y=1, which is far from 9, and I have to go up.\n\nAlso, later on, y=6 is unsafe at τ=4,5, etc.\n\nBut let's see the minimal H.\n\nFirst, I need to get past τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, I can be on y=1, or y=6,7,8.\n\nBut y=6,7,8 are high, I am at y=3 at start, so to reach y=6 at τ=2, I need to go up three times in two turns, impossible, since each step changes by at most 1.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 or 8 even worse.\n\nSo only possible safe row at τ=2 is y=1.\n\nSo I must be at y=1 at τ=2 to avoid collision.\n\nThen, from start, I need to go down to y=1 by τ=2.\n\nAt τ=0, y=3.\n\nIf I go down at τ=0, to y=2 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, go down again to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=1, safe.\n\nNow, from there, I can go up.\n\nBut it takes two turns to go down to y=1, and I was at y=3, so I wasted two turns going down.\n\nThen from y=1 at τ=2, I need to go to y=9.\n\nEach up move takes one turn, but I may need to wait for other unsafe times.\n\nNow, y=6 unsafe at τ=4 and 5.\n\ny=7 unsafe at τ=12-14, which is late, probably not an issue.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at τ=12-15.\n\nBut since I am at τ=2, I can reach y=6 by τ=4 or so.\n\nLet's plan the path.\n\nStart: τ=0, turn 83, y=3\n\nAction a83: D, so y84 = y83 + (-1) = 2? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nΔy_t for a_t: U: +1, D: -1, S:0\n\nSo at turn t, do a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nPosition at turn t is y_t.\n\nAt turn 83: y=3\n\nDo a83 = D, then y84 = 3 + (-1) = 2\n\nAt turn 84: y=2\n\nDo a84 = D, then y85 = 2 + (-1) =1\n\nAt turn 85: y=1, and τ=2 (since T=85, τ=85-83=2), and y=1 is safe at τ=2, as above.\n\nNow, from here, I need to go up.\n\nBut y=6 is unsafe at τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nτ=4 is turn 87, τ=5 turn 88.\n\nNow, at turn 85, y=1, τ=2\n\nI can go up.\n\nDo a85 = U, then y86 =1 +1 =2\n\nAt turn 86: y=2, τ=3 (turn 86, τ=3)\n\nNow y=2 at τ=3: is it safe? y=2 unsafe only at τ=2, at τ=3: first car span [-35+12*3, -24+12*3]=[-35+36,-24+36]=[1,12]>0, not 0.

No.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T when I am on y_T between 1 and 8.\n\nWhen I reach y=9, I am on y=9, no cars, so no collision.\n\nThe turns where I might collide are from turn t1 to the turn before reaching y=9, but when I am on y=9, it's safe.\n\nIn the sequence, from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -1, I am at positions y_{t1} to y_{t1 + H -1}, and at turn t1 + H, I am at y=9.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn from t1 to t1 + H -1, when I am on some y between 0 and 9, but only if between 1 and 8 and car present.\n\nIn my earlier path, I started going down.\n\nBut let's list the turns and positions.\n\nTurn 83 (τ=0): y=3, do a83=D, then y84=2\n\nTurn 84 (τ=1): y=2, do a84=D, then y85=1\n\nTurn 85 (τ=2): y=1, do a85=U, then y86=2\n\nTurn 86 (τ=3): y=2, do a86=U, then y87=3\n\nTurn 87 (τ=4): y=3, do a87=U, then y88=4\n\nTurn 88 (τ=5): y=4, do a88=U, then y89=5\n\nTurn 89 (τ=6): y=5, do a89=U, then y90=6\n\nTurn 90 (τ=7): y=6, do a90=U, then y91=7\n\nTurn 91 (τ=8): y=7, do a91=U, then y92=8\n\nTurn 92 (τ=9): y=8, do a92=U, then y93=9\n\nNow, collision check at each turn:\n\nTurn 83: y=3, safe as before.\n\nTurn 84: y=2, τ=1, safe.\n\nTurn 85: y=1, τ=2, safe.\n\nTurn 86: y=2, τ=3, safe (as y=2 unsafe only τ=2)\n\nTurn 87: y=3, τ=4, safe (y=3 unsafe only τ=2)\n\nTurn 88: y=4, τ=5, safe (y=4 unsafe only τ=2)\n\nTurn 89: y=5, τ=6, safe\n\nTurn 90: y=6, τ=7, safe (y=6 unsafe τ=4,5)\n\nTurn 91: y=7, τ=8, safe\n\nTurn 92: y=8, τ=9, safe\n\nThen turn 93: y=9, reached, no need to check collision.\n\nH=10 actions? From t=83 to t=92, that's 10 actions: t=83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92.\n\nt1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to H-1, number of actions is H.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nt1 + H =93, t1=83, so H=10.\n\nBut earlier I thought min is 6, but due to cars, I took 10 turns.\n\nBut I had to go down to avoid τ=2.\n\nIs there a faster way?\n\nPerhaps I can stay instead of going down.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, y=3, do S, then at τ=1, y=3, safe.\n\nBut then at τ=1, I must do something to avoid being on y=2,3,4,5 at τ=2.\n\nBut from y=3, I can only go to y=2,3,4, all unsafe at τ=2.\n\nNo.\n\nIf I go up to y=4 at τ=1, same issue.\n\nSo I must be at y=1 at τ=2 to be safe.\n\nNo other choice, since I can't reach y=6,7,8 at τ=2.\n\ny=0 is also possible, but y=0 has no cars, always safe.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, no freeway, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\nAt τ=2, I can be on y=0,1,6,7,8.\n\nBut y=0: from y=3, to y=0 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=0, y=3, do D to y=2 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=2, do D to y=1 or to y=1? To go to y=0, do D again.\n\ny=1 to y=0.\n\nBut y=0 is safe.\n\nThen from y=0, go up.\n\nBut similar to y=1, takes time.\n\nFrom y=0, it takes even longer to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, from y=0 at τ=2, need to go up 9 times to y=9, so at least 9 actions from there, total more turns.\n\nWorse than y=1.\n\nSo better to go to y=1.\n\nIn my path, I used 10 turns to reach y=9 at turn 93.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach faster.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=6 at τ=4 or 5, but unsafe, so I need to avoid y=6 at τ=4 and 5.\n\nIn my path, I was on y=6 at τ=7, which is safe.\n\nBut τ=7 is later.\n\nCan I be on y=6 earlier?\n\nFor example, from start, if I could go up faster, but I was blocked at τ=2.\n\nSuppose I go up at τ=0 to y=4 at τ=1.\n\nThen I am stuck, must collide at τ=2.\n\nNot possible.\n\nStay at τ=0, y=3 at τ=1, same.\n\nSo no, I must go down or something to avoid.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=1, if I am on y=4, I could go down to y=3, but at τ=2 y=3 unsafe.\n\nOr, but I can only change by 1.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=5 at τ=1, but from y=3 at τ=0, I can only be at y=4 at τ=1 if I go up, not y=5.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSo I think the only way is to be at y=1 at τ=2.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach y=9 with fewer than 10 turns.\n\nMinimal is 6, but not possible.\n\nWith 7 turns: suppose I start at τ=0, y=3.\n\nI need to reach y=9 by τ=6, for example.\n\ny_{t1 + H} =9 at τ=H.\n\nt1 + H, τ = H.\n\nSet at τ=H, y=9.\n\nThen at previous turns.\n\nBut I have to avoid unsafe positions.\n\nAt τ=2, I must be on y=1 or 0 or 6,7,8, but y=6,7,8 not reachable from y=3 in 2 steps.\n\nIn two steps from τ=0 to τ=2, I can change y by at most 2, so from y=3, at τ=2, y between 1 and 5, so only y=1 is safe, as before.\n\nThus, I must be at y=1 at τ=2.\n\nThen from y=1 at τ=2, to y=9 at τ=H, I need to go up 8 steps, but with possible stays, but to minimize, go up as much.\n\nBut y=6 unsafe at τ=4 and 5.\n\nτ=4 and 5 are turns 87 and 88.\n\nAt τ=2, turn 85, y=1.\n\nIf I go up each time:\n\nTurn 85: y=1, do U, y86=2\n\nTurn 86: y=2, do U, y87=3\n\nTurn 87: y=3, τ=4\n\nBut y=6 is unsafe at τ=4, but I am at y=3, not y=6.\n\nAt τ=4, I am at y=3.\n\nThen do U, y88=4 at τ=5\n\nTurn 88: y=4, τ=5\n\nThen U, y89=5\n\nU, y90=6\n\nAt turn 90: y=6, τ=6? Turn 90: t1=83, turn 90 is τ=7? Turn 83: τ=0, turn 84:τ=1, turn 85:τ=2, turn 86:τ=3, turn 87:τ=4, turn 88:τ=5, turn 89:τ=6, turn 90:τ=7.\n\nIn this: from turn 85: τ=2, y=1\n\nDo U: y86=2, τ=3\n\nDo U: y87=3, τ=4\n\nDo U: y88=4, τ=5\n\nDo U: y89=5, τ=6\n\nDo U: y90=6, τ=7\n\ny=6 at τ=7, safe as before.\n\nThen continue to y=9 at τ=10, same as before.\n\nBut at τ=4, I was at y=3, not y=6.\n\ny=6 unsafe at τ=4 and 5, but I was not on it.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=5, I was at y=4.\n\nNo issue.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nFrom y=1 at τ=2, if I could go faster, but I can only go one step per turn.\n\nTo reach y=9, from y=1, I need 8 up moves, so at least 8 turns from there.\n\nAt τ=2, start from y=1, after 8 up moves, at τ=10, y=9.\n\nτ from 2 to 10, that's 8 turns: actions at τ=2 to τ=9, y set at τ=3 to τ=10.\n\nActions at turn t from 85 to 92, y at turn 86 to 93.\n\ny=9 at turn 93.\n\nPlus the two turns to get to y=1 at τ=2: turns 83 and 84.\n\nSo total turns: from t=83 to t=92 actions, 10 actions, H=10.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach y=9 before τ=10.\n\nFor example, if I start going up later, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=0, I go up to y=4 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, instead of going to y=3,4,5 at τ=2, I cannot, but if I could stay until τ=3, but at τ=2 I must not be on y=2-5.\n\nBut I have to be somewhere at τ=2.\n\nUnless I go down to y=3 at τ=1, but same.\n\nI think it's impossible to avoid without going down.\n\nPerhaps for y=6, since unsafe at τ=4 and 5, I can be there at other times.\n\nBut in the path, I was at τ=7, fine.\n\nBut to save time, from y=1 at τ=2, I go up to y=2 at τ=3, y=3 at τ=4, but at τ=4, y=3 is safe, but I could go directly to higher if possible, but not.\n\ny=6 at τ=4 is unsafe, so I cannot be on y=6 at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, if I could reach y=6 at τ=3, but from y=1 at τ=2, I can go to y=2 at τ=3, not y=6.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSo I think 10 turns is minimal.\n\nBut let's see if I can reduce by avoiding the down and up.\n\nFor example, if I go down at τ=0 to y=2 at τ=1, then at τ=1, I go up to y=3, but at τ=2 y=3 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo down to y=2 at τ=1, then at τ=1, go down to y=1 at τ=2, same as before.\n\nThen from y=1 up.\n\nBut when going up, at some point I might need to wait for y=6.\n\nBut in this case, I reached y=6 at τ=7, which is after unsafe times τ=4,5, so no need to wait.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and 8 unsafe late, not issue.\n\nSo with 10 actions, I reach.\n\nBut H=10, and sequence as above.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I used two down actions at beginning.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the path: actions at turn 83 to 92.\n\nt1=83.\n\na83: D\n\na84: D\n\na85: U\n\na86: U\n\na87: U\n\na88: U\n\na89: U\n\na90: U\n\na91: U\n\na92: U\n\nThen at turn 93, y=9.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nTurn 83: action a83=D, position y83=3\n\nAfter action, y84=3-1=2\n\nTurn 84: y=2, action a84=D, y85=2-1=1\n\nTurn 85: y=1, action a85=U, y86=1+1=2\n\nTurn 86: y=2, action a86=U, y87=2+1=3\n\nTurn 87: y=3, action a87=U, y88=3+1=4\n\nTurn 88: y=4, action a88=U, y89=4+1=5\n\nTurn 89: y=5, action a89=U, y90=5+1=6\n\nTurn 90: y=6, action a90=U, y91=6+1=7\n\nTurn 91: y=7, action a91=U, y92=7+1=8\n\nTurn 92: y=8, action a92=U, y93=8+1=9\n\nNow, collision:\n\nTurn 83: y=3, τ=0, safe\n\nTurn 84: y=2, τ=1, safe (as before)\n\nTurn 85: y=1, τ=2, safe\n\nTurn 86: y=2, τ=3, safe (y=2 unsafe only τ=2)\n\nTurn 87: y=3, τ=4, safe\n\nTurn 88: y=4, τ=5, safe\n\nTurn 89: y=5, τ=6, safe\n\nTurn 90: y=6, τ=7, safe\n\nTurn 91: y=7, τ=8, safe\n\nTurn 92: y=8, τ=9, safe\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=9?\n\nSuppose I reach y=9 at turn 92, so τ=9.\n\nThen y_{92} =9.\n\nWhich means at turn 92, I am at y=9, so I arrived at turn 92.\n\nThen actions from t=83 to t=91, H=9 actions.\n\nAfter 9 actions, y_{83+9} = y_{92} =9.\n\nNow, at turn 92, y=9, safe.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9 at turn 92.\n\nThat means from turn 83 to 91, I move from y=3 to y=9 with 8 steps? Actions at t=83 to t=91, 9 actions, but the position changes from y_{83} to y_{92}.\n\ny_{83} =3, y_{92}=9, difference 6, so I need net +6 in y, with 9 actions, so possible with 6 U and 3 S, or 7 U and 2 D, etc., but since D reduces, it might take more U.\n\nNet change: each U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\nSo to go from 3 to 9, +6, so number of U minus number of D must be 6.\n\nNumber of actions H, let U be number of U, D number of D, S number of S.\n\nU + D + S = H\n\nU - D = 6\n\nSo U = D + 6\n\nThen H = (D+6) + D + S = 2D + S + 6\n\nSince S >=0, D>=0, H >=6.\n\nMinimal H=6 when D=0,S=0,U=6.\n\nBut we saw not possible due to cars.\n\nWith H=9, U - D =6, H=2D + S +6 =9, so 2D + S =3.\n\nPossible (D,S) = (0,3), (1,1), (1,2)? 2D+S=3.\n\nD=0, S=3\n\nD=1, S=1\n\nD=1, S=2? 2*1 +2=4>3, no.\n\n2D + S =3.\n\nSo (D,S) = (0,3) or (1,1)\n\nIf D=0, S=3, U=6\n\nIf D=1, S=1, U=7\n\nU= D+6, so if D=1, U=7.\n\nNow, I need to have a path from y=3 to y=9 in 9 actions, avoiding collisions.\n\nAnd at τ=2, I must not be on y=2,3,4,5.\n\nτ=2 is turn 85.\n\nAt turn 85, I must be on y=0,1,6,7,8.\n\nBut from start, at turn 83, y=3.\n\nAfter two actions (at t=83 and 84), I am at y at turn 85.\n\ny at turn 85 depends on actions.\n\nLet y_t be position at turn t.\n\ny83=3\n\nAfter a83, y84 = y83 + Δy83\n\nAfter a84, y85 = y84 + Δy84\n\ny85 must be in {0,1,6,7,8}\n\nNow, y84 = 3 + Δy83, which can be 2,3,4\n\nThen y85 = y84 + Δy84\n\nIf y84=2, y85=1,2,3\n\nIf y84=3, y85=2,3,4\n\nIf y84=4, y85=3,4,5\n\nNone of these include 6,7,8.\n\nSo y85 can only be between 1 and 5, depending.\n\nFrom above, possible y85: min 1 (if down down), max 5 (if up up), but 6 not possible.\n\nSimilarly, y=0: if from y84=1, but y84 min is 2 if down from 3, or 3 or 4.\n\ny84=2,3,4\n\nIf y84=2, y85=1,2,3\n\ny85=1 possible.\n\ny85=0 only if y84=1 and down, but y84 cannot be 1.\n\nSimilarly, y85=5 if y84=4 and up.\n\nBut not 6,7,8.\n\nSo only possible safe y at turn 85 (τ=2) is y=1.\n\nSo I must be at y=1 at turn 85.\n\nThen from y=3 at turn 83, to y=1 at turn 85, I need to go down twice: a83=D, a84=D, y85=1.\n\nThen from y=1 at turn 85, to y=9 at turn 92.\n\nTurn 92 is 7 turns later: actions at turn 85 to 91.\n\ny at turn 92 must be 9.\n\ny85=1, y92=9, so in 7 actions, net change +8? y from turn 85 to turn 92.\n\nTurn 85: position y85\n\nAfter actions a85 to a91, y92 is set.\n\nAfter k actions, from y85 to y_{85 + k}\n\nHere, from turn 85 to turn 92, after 7 actions, y92 = y85 + sum Δy from t=85 to 91.\n\nNumber of actions: a85 to a91, 7 actions.\n\ny92 = y85 + (U - D) over these actions.\n\ny85=1, y92=9, so U - D = 8\n\nLet U' be number of U, D' number of D, S' number of S in these 7 actions.\n\nU' + D' + S' =7\n\nU' - D' =8\n\nBut U' - D' =8, U' + D' >= U' - D' =8, so U' + D' + S' >=8, but H=7, contradiction.\n\nImpossible.\n\ny92 = y85 + (U' - D') =1 + (U' - D') =9, so U' - D' =8\n\nThen U' + D' + S' =7\n\nBut U' + D' >= |U' - D'| =8, so U' + D' >=8, thus U' + D' + S' >=8 >7, impossible.\n\nTherefore, cannot reach y=9 at turn 92 from y=1 at turn 85 in 7 actions.\n\nMinimal from y=1 to y=9 is 8 actions: 8 up, or with stays, but with stays, it takes more turns.\n\nWith 8 actions, U' - D' =8, U' + D' + S' =8, so D'=0, S'=0, U'=8, which takes 8 turns.\n\nThus from turn 85 to turn 92, 8 actions: a85 to a92, then y93= y85 + 8 =1+8=9.\n\nBut turn 93, not 92.\n\nIf I want y92=9, I need to be at y=9 at turn 92, which requires y92=9, so from y85=1, I need to reach y=9 in 7 steps, impossible since max increase 7, but y=1 to y=8, not 9.\n\ny92 = y85 + sum of 7 Δy, each <=1, so y92 <=1+7=8, cannot be 9.\n\nThus, cannot reach y=9 before turn 93.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 10, with y=9 at turn 93.\n\nAnd the sequence I have works.\n\nBut in my sequence, I used only U and D, no S.\n\nWith H=10, U - D =6, since from y=3 to y=9, net +6.\n\nU=8, D=2, S=0? U - D=6, U + D + S=10, so 2U + S =16? U - D=6, U + D + S=10, add: 2U + S =16, subtract: 2D + S=4.\n\nSince S=0, D=2, U=8, as in my sequence.\n\nIf S>0, H larger, so minimal with no S.\n\nNow, about y=6 unsafe at τ=4,5, but in my path, I was not on y=6 then, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, later unsafe times are late, not relevant.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nt1=83.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 83: a_{83} = D\n\nTurn 84: a_{84} = D\n\nTurn 85: a_{85} = U\n\nTurn 86: a_{86} = U\n\nTurn 87: a_{87} = U\n\nTurn 88: a_{88} = U\n\nTurn 89: a_{89} = U\n\nTurn 90: a_{90} = U\n\nTurn 91: a_{91} = U\n\nTurn 92: a_{92} = U\n\nIn the sequence, up to H-1=9, since t from 0 to H-1, H=10, so t=0 to 9, which is turns 83 to 92.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 7 has two cars, but we handled.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo minimal H=10.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10 but different sequence?\n\nFor example, instead of going down at beginning, but I think not.\n\nPerhaps I can go down only once, but to y=1 at τ=2, I need two down, since from y=3 to y=1, two steps.\n\nIf I go to y=0, worse.\n\nSo I think it's optimal.\n\nThus the sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 83\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 10.

Thus, the player must move down to \\(y=1\\) by turn 85.\n\n### Path to \\(y=9\\) in Minimal Turns\n- **Start at turn 83 (\\(\\tau=0\\)):** Position \\(y=3\\) (safe).\n- **Turn 83 action:** Move down (D) to \\(y=2\\) at turn 84.\n- **Turn 84 action:** Move down (D) to \\(y=1\\) at turn 85 (safe at \\(y=1\\), \\(\\tau=2\\)).\n- From \\(y=1\\) at turn 85, move up repeatedly to reach \\(y=9\\).\n- The path avoids \\(y=6\\) at unsafe times \\(\\tau=4,5\\) (turns 87,88) by being on lower rows (\\(y=3\\) at turn 87 and \\(y=4\\) at turn 88), both safe.\n- After reaching \\(y=6\\) at turn 90 (\\(\\tau=7\\), safe), continue up to \\(y=9\\) by turn 93.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t}\\}_{t=83}^{92}\\) (10 actions) results in \\(y_{93} = 9\\):\n- Turn 83: \\(a_{83} = D\\) → \\(y_{84} = 2\\)\n- Turn 84: \\(a_{84} = D\\) → \\(y_{85} = 1\\)\n- Turn 85: \\(a_{85} = U\\) → \\(y_{86} = 2\\)\n- Turn 86: \\(a_{86} = U\\) → \\(y_{87} = 3\\)\n- Turn 87: \\(a_{87} = U\\) → \\(y_{88} = 4\\)\n- Turn 88: \\(a_{88} = U\\) → \\(y_{89} = 5\\)\n- Turn 89: \\(a_{89} = U\\) → \\(y_{90} = 6\\)\n- Turn 90: \\(a_{90} = U\\) → \\(y_{91} = 7\\)\n- Turn 91: \\(a_{91} = U\\) → \\(y_{92} = 8\\)\n- Turn 92: \\(a_{92} = U\\) → \\(y_{93} = 9\\)\n\n### Collision Check\n- Turn 83 (\\(y=3, \\tau=0\\)): Safe (no car at \\(x=0\\)).\n- Turn 84 (\\(y=2, \\tau=1\\)): Safe (no car at \\(x=0\\)).\n- Turn 85 (\\(y=1, \\tau=2\\)): Safe (no car at \\(x=0\\)).\n- Turn 86 (\\(y=2, \\tau=3\\)): Safe (unsafe only at \\(\\tau=2\\)).\n- Turn 87 (\\(y=3, \\tau=4\\)): Safe (unsafe only at \\(\\tau=2\\)).\n- Turn 88 (\\(y=4, \\tau=5\\)): Safe (unsafe only at \\(\\tau=2\\)).\n- Turn 89 (\\(y=5, \\tau=6\\)): Safe (unsafe only at \\(\\tau=2\\)).\n- Turn 90 (\\(y=6, \\tau=7\\)): Safe (unsafe at \\(\\tau=4,5\\), not \\(\\tau=7\\)).\n- Turn 91 (\\(y=7, \\tau=8\\)): Safe (unsafe at \\(\\tau=12-14\\), not \\(\\tau=8\\)).\n- Turn 92 (\\(y=8, \\tau=9\\)): Safe (unsafe at \\(\\tau=12-15\\), not \\(\\tau=9\\)).\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y=9\\) in 10 turns with no collisions, and \\(H=10\\) is minimal because:\n- Avoiding the unsafe rows at \\(\\tau=2\\) requires being at \\(y=1\\) at turn 85, which takes two down actions from \\(y=3\\).\n- From \\(y=1\\), reaching \\(y=9\\) requires at least 8 up actions (net change of +8), taking 8 turns.\n- Total minimal turns: 2 (down to \\(y=1\\)) + 8 (up to \\(y=9\\)) = 10.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 83: \\, D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 84: \\, D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 89: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 90: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 91: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 92: \\, U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 2) on turn t_1 = 84. I need to get to (0, 9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. Since we're starting at y=2 and need to get to y=9, moving up is generally better, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, the x-position 0 is within the car's span at that turn. The car spans move left or right based on their direction and speed.\n\nImportant point: when you move to a new freeway, you're not on that freeway until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and you arrive at y+1 at turn T+1. So you only check for collision on the freeway you're currently on at that turn.\n\nFrom the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut for collision, it's based on the current freeway at turn T. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's y-position at turn T.\n\nWhen you take an action at turn T, it determines y_{T+1}. But for collision at turn T, it's based on y_T, not y_{T+1}.\n\nThe player update is: at turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nBut collision is checked at each turn based on y_t.\n\nFrom the game dynamics:\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the player's position at turn T.\n\nAnd Span(T) is the car's span at turn T.\n\nAlso, when you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and after action, you move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nSo for example, at turn T, position y_T, you choose action to go to y_{T+1}. Collision is checked based on y_T and the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, you are at y_{T+1}, and collision checked based on y_{T+1} and cars on that freeway at T+1.\n\nThe note clarifies that when moving, you are not on the new freeway until the next turn.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions from turn 84 onwards to reach y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nStart: turn 84, y=2.\n\nGoal: reach y=9, so we need to increase y by 7, since 9-2=7. But we can move down or stay, which might be necessary to avoid cars, but since we need to go up, moving down would be counterproductive unless to dodge something.\n\nBut moving down might be needed to avoid a collision if staying or moving up causes one.\n\nBut in this case, since all freeways have cars, we need to be careful.\n\nFirst, I should model the car positions over time.\n\nThe cars are given at turn t_1=84.\n\nFor each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right or left.\n\nFor left-moving, head decreases, for right-moving, head increases? Let's see the update.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for left-moving, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nBut head and tail: for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h]? No.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nIn the car state table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nThen in the update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\n\nThe notation is inconsistent.\n\nIn left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] with h and τ as given.\n\nBut for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so the order matters.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nSo for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-47, 0] because it says [τ, h] for the span.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 4: (12, 47, left, 36), Span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [12, 47]\n\nNow, the span is a interval, and for collision, we care if 0 is in that interval at turn T.\n\nAlso, cars are moving, so the span changes with time.\n\nt_1 = 84.\n\nLet me define the time offset. Set τ = T - t_1, so at τ=0, it's turn t_1.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to know when 0 is covered by a car on that freeway.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, and cars move horizontally, for each freeway, the collision times are when some car on that freeway has 0 in its span.\n\nThen, for the player to be safe on a freeway at time τ, 0 should not be in any car's span on that freeway at that time.\n\nτ is relative to t_1, so time step τ corresponds to turn t_1 + τ.\n\nPlayer position: at turn t_1 + τ, y_{t_1 + τ}.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn, say τ = H-1, so y_{t_1 + H-1} =9.\n\nH is the number of turns, so actions from t=0 to H-1 relative, so after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}, but we want to reach at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nAfter action at t_1+H-1, position at turn (t_1+H-1) +1 = t_1+H.\n\nBut we want to reach (0,9), so at some turn, y=9.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nLet's read:\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nFrom the task:\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1, so at turn t_1 + t for t from 0 to H-1, so after H actions, the position is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut we reach at turn t_1 + H -1, which is before the last action? I think I'm confusing the indexing.\n\nLet me clarify.\n\nDenote the turns: at turn T, position y_T.\n\nAction a_T is taken at turn T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, position y_{t_1} =2.\n\nWe take action a_{t_1} to go to y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nWe want that at some turn, say T, y_T =9, and we want the smallest H such that at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nH is the number of turns from start to reach.\n\nFor example, if we can reach in 0 turns, but we start at y=2 ≠9, so H at least 1.\n\nIf at turn t_1, we take action to go to y=9 at t_1+1, but we can only change by at most 1, so from y=2 to y=9, it takes at least 7 moves up.\n\nBut with possible detours.\n\nNow, the reach turn is t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo for H=1, reach at t_1 +1 -1 = t_1, but y_{t_1}=2≠9, impossible.\n\nH=2, reach at t_1 +2-1 = t_1+1, position y_{t_1+1}, which could be 9 if we move up from 8, but we start at 2.\n\nGenerally, to reach y=9 from y=2, we need at least 7 up moves, so H at least 7.\n\nBut with down or stay, H could be more.\n\nWe want minimal H.\n\nNow, at the turn when we reach y=9, it must be safe, meaning no collision on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, during the path, at each turn, when on a freeway between 1 and 8, we need to avoid collision.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since no cars there. The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so always safe.\n\nThe problem says: \"freeways y = 1, …, 8\", so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so when on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, collision only when on y=1 to 8.\n\nSo at y=0 or y=9, always safe.\n\nNow, back to the cars.\n\nI need to find for each freeway k=1 to 8, the times when 0 is covered by a car, so that if the player is on that freeway at that time, collision occurs.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nFor each freeway, I can find the set of τ where it is unsafe, or safe.\n\nτ is time since t_1, in turns.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head h=0, tail τ=-47, direction right, speed s=48)\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-47, 0]\n\nAt time τ (relative), Span = [τ + s * τ, h + s * τ]? Time from t_1.\n\nT = t_1 + τ, so ΔT = τ.\n\nSpan at T is Span(t_1) shifted by s * (T - t_1) = s * τ.\n\nFor right-moving car: Span(T) = [τ + s * τ, h + s * τ]\n\nSince for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left.\n\nFor freeway 1, right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-47, 0]\n\ns=48\n\nSo Span at τ: [ -47 + 48*τ , 0 + 48*τ ] = [48τ - 47, 48τ]\n\nNow, 0 is in span if min ≤ 0 ≤ max, so 48τ - 47 ≤ 0 ≤ 48τ\n\nSince 48τ -47 ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 48τ.\n\n48τ -47 ≤ 0 ⇒ τ ≤ 47/48 ≈ 0.979, so τ ≤ 0 since τ integer? τ is turn offset, integer.\n\nτ is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ 48τ, which is true for τ ≥ 0.\n\nAnd 48τ -47 ≤ 0 ⇒ τ ≤ 47/48 < 1, so τ =0 only.\n\n48τ -47 ≤ 0 ⇒ τ ≤ 47/48 <1, since τ integer, τ ≤ 0? τ ≥0, so τ=0.\n\nThen 0 ≤ 48τ, for τ=0, 0≤0, true.\n\nSo at τ=0, 0 is in [ -47, 0], yes.\n\nFor τ=1, Span = [48*1 -47, 48*1] = [1,48], 0 not in [1,48], so safe.\n\nτ=0: [48*0 -47, 48*0] = [-47,0], 0 in it.\n\nτ=1: [48-47, 48] = [1,48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nτ=2: [96-47,96] = [49,96], etc., all larger, so only unsafe at τ=0 for freeway 1.\n\nBut freeway 1 has only one car, so at τ=0, unsafe.\n\nNow, at τ=0, player is on y=2, not on freeway 1, so for freeway 1, we care when player is on it.\n\nBut for now, let's find for each freeway the unsafe times.\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe only at τ=0.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-12, -23, right, 12)\n\nRight-moving, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-23, -12]?

Let's list the turns.\n\nAt τ=0 (turn t_1), position y=2.\n\nAction D: so at τ=1 (turn t_1+1), y=1.\n\nAction U: at τ=2, y=2.\n\nAction U: at τ=3, y=3.\n\nAction U: at τ=4, y=4.\n\nAction U: at τ=5, y=5.\n\nAction U: at τ=6, y=6.\n\nAction U: at τ=7, y=7.\n\nAction U: at τ=8, y=8.\n\nAction U: at τ=9, y=9.\n\nSo at turn τ=9, y=9, which is the position at turn t_1 + 9.\n\nNow, we reach at turn t_1 + H -1 = t_1 + 9, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions: from τ=0 to τ=9, but actions at t=0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nHere, actions at τ=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8: that's 9 actions? τ from 0 to 8 for actions.\n\nActions: at time τ, action a_{t_1 + τ} for τ=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, position at τ=H.\n\nWe want position at τ=H-1 to be 9? From the problem.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nTurn t_1 + H -1, position y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn terms of τ, at τ = H-1, y_{H-1} =9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at τ=9, y=9, so τ= H-1 =9, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions: τ from 0 to 9, but actions at τ=0 to τ=8? Let's index.\n\nSet τ relative: actions at step t=0,1,2,...,H-1.\n\nAfter action at t, position at t+1.\n\nStart: at turn T = t_1, position y_{t_1} =2.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position y_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + k}, position y_{t_1 + k +1}\n\nWe want at some turn, y_T =9 for T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThis means that after H-1 actions, position is at 9.\n\nSince we start at t_1, after 0 actions, position at t_1, y=2.\n\nAfter 1 action, position at t_1+1, etc.\n\nSo after k actions, position at t_1 + k.\n\nWe want position at t_1 + H -1 to be 9, so after (H-1) actions, position is 9.\n\nThus, we need to reach in H-1 steps.\n\nMinimal H-1, but H is number of turns, so minimal H.\n\nIn the path above, we reached at τ=9, which is after 9 steps from start? From τ=0 to τ=9, that's 9 intervals, 10 points.\n\nStart at τ=0, after 0 steps.\n\nAfter 1 step (action at τ=0), position at τ=1.\n\nAfter 2 steps, position at τ=2.\n\n...\n\nAfter k steps, position at τ=k.\n\nWe want position at τ = m to be 9, where m = H-1.\n\nSo after m steps, position at τ=m is 9.\n\nIn the path: we have actions leading to position at τ=9 being 9.\n\nSo after 9 steps, position at τ=9 is 9.\n\nThus m=9, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions: from t=0 to t=8, 9 actions? t from 0 to H-1=9? H-1=9, so actions t=0 to 8, that's 9 actions.\n\nt from 0 to H-1 inclusive, number of actions is H.\n\nIn sequence: actions at τ=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 for H=9? Let's set.\n\nDefine: let s be the step, s=0 to H-1 for actions.\n\nAfter s actions, position at time τ=s.\n\nPosition at τ=s is after s actions.\n\nWe want at some τ=s, y_s =9, and s = H-1.\n\nSo H-1 = s.\n\nFor minimal s such that we can reach in s steps.\n\nIn the path, we reached at s=9, y_9=9.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nEarlier I thought minimal 7, but with the initial constraint, we had to go down first.\n\nAt τ=0, we must go down to y=1 to avoid collision, since staying or up causes collision at τ=1.\n\nThen from y=1 at τ=1, we can go up.\n\nBut to reach y=9, from y=1, we need to go up 8 times, so at least 8 steps to y=9.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=2.\n\nAfter first action, to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nThen after 8 up actions, to y=9 at τ=9.\n\ns=9, y_s=9.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we go to y=0 at some point, but y=0 is safe, but moving down then up takes more time.\n\nFor instance, at τ=1, y=1, instead of going up, we could go down to y=0 at τ=2, then up, but that would take longer.\n\nFor example: from y=1 at τ=1, D to y=0 at τ=2, then U to y=1 at τ=3, etc., but this is slower, so worse.\n\nSo not useful.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster through the freeways by timing.\n\nBut in this case, after the first step, we can go straight up without issues until y=8, and y=6 unsafe at τ=3,4, but we are at y=6 at τ=6 or later, which is after, so safe.\n\nIn the path, at τ=6, y=6, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and y=8 unsafe at τ=11-14, which are later, so no problem.\n\nBut can we reach before τ=9?\n\nFor example, if we didn't have to go down first, but we must, because at τ=1, both y=2 and y=3 are unsafe.\n\nAt τ=0, after action, we go to y=1 at τ=1, which is safe.\n\nSuppose we go down to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=1, safe.\n\nNow, instead of going directly up, perhaps we can move faster, but we can only move one step per turn.\n\nUnless we can skip some levels by being at y=0 or something, but no, we move step by step.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 is unsafe at τ=3 and 4, but if we reach y=6 at τ=5 or later, it's fine.\n\nIn the current path, we reach at τ=6, which is after.\n\nBut we might reach earlier if we start from higher, but we start from y=2.\n\nMinimal s: from y=2 to y=9, need net +7 in y.\n\nEach up move +1, down -1, stay 0.\n\nTo minimize s, we want as few down and stay as possible, ideally all up.\n\nBut we had to do one down at start.\n\nIn the path, we did one down and eight up, total 9 moves to reach s=9.\n\nIf we could go up immediately, but we can't because at τ=1, y=2 or y=3 would be collision.\n\nUnless we delay or something.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, instead of moving, but if we stay, y=2 at τ=1, but y=2 unsafe at τ=1, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if up, y=3 at τ=1, unsafe.\n\nDown only option.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=0 first.\n\nAt τ=0, D to y=1 at τ=1? But y=1 at τ=1 is safe, as above.\n\nThen from y=1 at τ=1, we could go down to y=0 at τ=2, but that wastes time.\n\nThen from y=0 at τ=2, we can go up to y=1 at τ=3, and so on, but this takes more turns, so worse.\n\nSo minimal is to go down once, then up all the way.\n\nBut in the up all way, we have 8 up moves from y=1 to y=9.\n\nStart: after first down, at τ=1, y=1.\n\nThen after k up moves, y=1+k at τ=1+k.\n\nSet to 9: 1+k=9, k=8, so at τ=1+8=9, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nCan we have some up moves faster? No, because we can only move one per turn.\n\nUnless we can be at y=6 earlier, but y=6 is unsafe at τ=3,4, but if we reach y=6 at τ=5 or later, ok.\n\nIn this case, we reach y=6 at τ=6, which is fine.\n\nBut can we reach y=9 before τ=9?\n\nFor example, if we start at y=2, after one up, we could be at y=3, but at τ=1, y=3 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, no.\n\nPerhaps at τ=0, we stay or something, but staying at y=2 at τ=1 causes collision.\n\nNo other choice.\n\nSo the sequence must start with down.\n\nThen from there, we can go up directly.\n\nBut in the path, when we go from y=1 to y=2 at τ=2, y=2 safe at τ=2.\n\nThen to y=3 at τ=3, y=3 safe.\n\nBut y=3 unsafe only at τ=1, which is past.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, but we have to worry about y=6 at τ=3,4 unsafe.\n\nIn the path, we are at y=6 at τ=6, which is after τ=4, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and y=8 unsafe later, not issue.\n\nBut is there a way to reach y=9 earlier, say at τ=8?\n\nTo reach at τ=8, y=9.\n\nThat means after 8 steps, position at τ=8 is 9.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=2.\n\nAfter 8 actions, at τ=8, y=9.\n\nNet change +7, so we need 7 up and one other move, but since we must start with down, that would be one down and 7 up, but from y=2, down to y=1, then up 7 times to y=8, not to 9.\n\ny=1 +7 = y=8 at τ=8.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need 8 up moves or equivalent.\n\nFrom start y=2, to y=9, need +7, so minimal 7 up moves with no down or stay, but we can't because of the initial collision.\n\nWith one down, we need at least 8 up moves to compensate, but let's see.\n\nAfter first down: at τ=1, y=1.\n\nThen to reach y=9, we need +8, so at least 8 up moves, taking 8 more steps, to τ=9.\n\nIf we do a down later, it would take more.\n\nSo indeed, minimal to reach at τ=9 with H=10 actions.\n\nH is number of turns, from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, with actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn this case, with the sequence:\n\nAt τ=0 (t_1), action D, to y=1 at τ=1\n\nτ=1 (t_1+1), action U, to y=2 at τ=2\n\nτ=2 (t_1+2), action U, to y=3 at τ=3\n\nτ=3 (t_1+3), action U, to y=4 at τ=4\n\nτ=4 (t_1+4), action U, to y=5 at τ=5\n\nτ=5 (t_1+5), action U, to y=6 at τ=6\n\nτ=6 (t_1+6), action U, to y=7 at τ=7\n\nτ=7 (t_1+7), action U, to y=8 at τ=8\n\nτ=8 (t_1+8), action U, to y=9 at τ=9\n\nNow at τ=9, which is turn t_1 + 9, y=9.\n\nAnd H-1=9, so H=10.\n\nBut we have actions from τ=0 to τ=8, that's 9 actions? τ from 0 to 8 inclusive is 9 actions.\n\nH should be 10? I think I have confusion.\n\nTurn: at turn t_1, we take action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1+1}\n\nAt turn t_1+1, take action a_{t_1+1}, determine y_{t_1+2}, etc.\n\nAfter k actions, we have y_{t_1 + k}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\n\nThis means that after (H-1) actions, y is 9.\n\nAfter 0 actions: y at t_1, not 9\n\nAfter 1 action: y at t_1+1\n\n...\n\nAfter m actions: y at t_1 + m\n\nSet t_1 + m = t_1 + H -1, so m = H-1\n\ny at t_1 + m =9\n\nIn the sequence, after 9 actions, y at t_1 +9 =9\n\nSo m=9, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 +9}, but a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to 9? H-1=9, so t=0 to 8? t from 0 to H-1 inclusive, so for H=10, t=0 to 9? No.\n\nt from 0 to H-1 means indices 0,1,2,...,H-1, that's H actions.\n\nFor example, H=1: t=0, one action.\n\nAfter that, position at t_1 +1.\n\nWe want position at t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor H=1, position at t_1, which is start, not 9.\n\nFor H=10, position at t_1 +9.\n\nIn sequence, actions at: t_1 + t for t=0 to 9? t=0 to H-1, H=10, t=0 to 9, 10 actions? But we have only 9 actions above.\n\nIn my sequence, I have actions at τ=0 to τ=8, 9 actions, leading to position at τ=9.\n\nPosition at τ=9 after 9 actions.\n\nSo m=9, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nBut with 9 actions, we reach position at t_1 +9.\n\nActions: a_{t_1} (t=0), a_{t_1+1} (t=1), ..., a_{t_1+8} (t=8), so t from 0 to 8, that's 9 actions.\n\nThen position at t_1 +9.\n\nSo for H=10, t from 0 to 9? That would be 10 actions, position at t_1+10.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nI think I have off-by-one.\n\nDefine:\n\nLet the actions be taken at times T = t_1, t_1+1, t_1+2, ..., up to t_1 + K for some K.\n\nAfter action at T, position at T+1.\n\nStart: at T=t_1, position y_{t_1} =2.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position y_{t_1+1}\n\nAfter action a_{t_1+1}, position y_{t_1+2}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + k}, position y_{t_1 + k +1}\n\nWe want that at turn S = t_1 + H -1, y_S =9.\n\nS = t_1 + H -1.\n\ny_S =9.\n\nS must be after some action.\n\ny_S is the position at turn S.\n\nThis can be after action at S-1, or something.\n\nFor example, if S = t_1, y_{t_1} =2≠9.\n\nIf S = t_1+1, y_{t_1+1}, which is after action a_{t_1}.\n\nIf y_{t_1+1}=9, but from y=2, impossible in one move.\n\nIn general, y_S is set by actions before S.\n\nSpecifically, y_S depends on actions up to a_{S-1}.\n\nSince a_{S-1} determines y_S.\n\nFrom y_{t_1} to y_S, we need |S - t_1| moves or something.\n\nThe number of actions to reach position at time S.\n\nFrom time t_1 to time S, there are (S - t_1) actions that affect the position from y_{t_1} to y_S.\n\nSpecifically, actions at t_1 to S-1 determine y_S.\n\nBecause a_{t_1} determines y_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{S-1} determines y_S.\n\nSo to have y_S =9, we need actions from a_{t_1} to a_{S-1}, that's (S - t_1) actions.\n\nThen S = t_1 + H -1, so S - t_1 = H -1.\n\nThus number of actions is H-1.\n\nAnd with these H-1 actions, we reach y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have y at τ=9 = t_1 +9, so S = t_1 +9.\n\nThus H-1 = S - t_1 =9, so H=10.\n\nAnd number of actions is H-1=9.\n\nIn my sequence, I have 9 actions: from τ=0 to τ=8, leading to y at τ=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nIn this path, we have no collision, as we checked.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nH=10, but perhaps we can reach earlier.\n\nFor example, if we can reach at S=t_1+8, y=9.\n\nThen H-1=8, H=9.\n\nS - t_1 =8.\n\nThen we need to reach y=9 from y=2 in 8 actions? Net +7, so possible with 7 up and one stay or something, but with the constraints.\n\nTo reach in fewer steps, but we must start with down, so after first action, at t_1+1, y=1.\n\nThen from y=1 at t_1+1, to y=9 at S=t_1+8.\n\nThat means from time t_1+1 to t_1+8, 7 steps? From position at t_1+1 to position at t_1+8.\n\nPosition at t_1+1 is y=1.\n\nPosition at t_1+8 is y=9.\n\nThe actions from a_{t_1+1} to a_{t_1+7} determine y_{t_1+2} to y_{t_1+8}.\n\nSpecifically, actions at T=t_1+1 to t_1+7 (7 actions) determine y from y_{t_1+2} to y_{t_1+8}.\n\nBut we start from y_{t_1+1}=1, and after actions, y_{t_1+8}=9.\n\nSo we need to go from y=1 at time t_1+1 to y=9 at time t_1+8.\n\nThat requires increasing by 8 in 7 steps? From time t_1+1 to t_1+8, there are 7 intervals, 7 actions.\n\nEach action can increase y by at most 1, so from y=1, after 7 actions, max y=1+7=8, or with down, less.\n\nCannot reach y=9 in 7 actions from y=1.\n\nMinimal to reach y=9 from y=1 is 8 actions: all up.\n\nThen y at t_1+1 +8 = t_1+9.\n\nThus cannot reach before t_1+9.\n\nSimilarly, from start, minimal reach at t_1+9 with y=9.\n\nSo H-1=9, H=10.\n\nNow, but in the path, we need to ensure that at y=6, we are not at τ=3 or 4.\n\nIn our case, at τ=6, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut in the sequence, when we go to y=6 at τ=6, safe.\n\nBut τ=6 is t_1+6.\n\nNow, but we have freeway 7 and 8 with unsafe times later, but we pass through earlier.\n\nIn the path, we are on y=7 at τ=7, which is before τ=11, safe.\n\ny=8 at τ=8, before τ=11, safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut is there a problem at other points?\n\nFor example, at τ=1, we are on y=1, safe.\n\nτ=2, y=2, safe since unsafe only τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut we need to output the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, at τ=0, action D.\n\nBut τ=0 is turn t_1=84.\n\nNow, the answer should be actions from turn t_1.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have:\n\nTurn t_1: D\n\nThen turn t_1+1: U\n\nt_1+2: U\n\n...\n\nup to t_1+8: U\n\nAfter that, at turn t_1+9, y=9.\n\nBut we need to specify actions until we reach.\n\nIn this case, with 9 actions.\n\nBut let's list:\n\nTurn t_1 (84): action D\n\nTurn 85: action U  (to y=2 at turn 85? Let's see time.\n\nAt turn t_1=84, position y=2.\n\nAction a_{84} = D, so y_{85} =1\n\nThen at turn 85, position y=1, action a_{85} = U, so y_{86} =2\n\nTurn 86, y=2, action U, y_{87}=3\n\nTurn 87, y=3, action U, y_{88}=4\n\nTurn 88, y=4, action U, y_{89}=5\n\nTurn 89, y=5, action U, y_{90}=6\n\nTurn 90, y=6, action U, y_{91}=7\n\nTurn 91, y=7, action U, y_{92}=8\n\nTurn 92, y=8, action U, y_{93}=9\n\nNow at turn 93, y=9, which is t_1 + 9, since t_1=84, 84+9=93.\n\nAnd H-1=9, so H=10.\n\nActions from turn 84 to 92, that's turns 84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92: 9 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions at turn 84 to 92, and position reaches 9 at turn 93.\n\nBut the reach turn is t_1 + H -1 = 84 + 10 -1 = 93, yes.\n\nNow, but in the output, it should be the actions.\n\nBut is this minimal? We think so.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a shorter path.\n\nSuppose at some point we move faster, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps we can stay at some freeway to avoid, but in this case, no need.\n\nAnother thing: freeway y=6 is unsafe at τ=3,4.\n\nIn our path, we are not on y=6 at those times.\n\nAt τ=3, we are on y=3 or something.\n\nIn the sequence, at τ=3 (turn 87), y=3.\n\nSafe.\n\nτ=4, y=4, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier by taking a different route, but from y=1, we need 8 up moves.\n\nUnless we can be on y=9 before, but no.\n\nSo I think H=10 is minimal.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions: D, then U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nTurn 84: D\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nBut this is 9 actions, but H=10, we need to specify up to t=H-1, which is 9 actions? t from 0 to H-1=9.\n\nIn the sequence, after these, at turn 93, y=9, but we don't need an action after that.\n\nThe actions are to reach at turn H-1.\n\nIn this case, with actions at turn 84 to 92, we reach at turn 93, but turn 93 is t_1 +9, and H-1=9, so turn t_1 + H -1 =93, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nThe last action is at turn 92, which sets y_{93}=9.\n\nNow, for the output, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = D\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 +8: a_{t_1+8} = U\n\nWith H=10.\n\nBut t_1 +8 =84+8=92.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut we need to write for each turn.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have only 9 actions, but H=10 implies 10 actions? No.\n\nH is the number of turns, meaning the sequence has H actions.\n\nIn the task: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nSo for H=10, t from 0 to 9, 10 actions.\n\nBut in our case, with 9 actions we reach, so H should be 10 with 10 actions, but the 10th action might not be needed.\n\nProblem.\n\nAfter y=9, we don't need to act, but the sequence includes actions until we reach.\n\nIn this case, with 9 actions, we reach at turn 93.\n\nIf H=10, we need 10 actions, but the last action might be after reaching, or something.\n\nFor example, if we add an action at turn 93, but we are already at y=9, and action could be S or whatever, but we reach at turn 93, so for H=10, we reach at turn t_1 + H -1 =84 +10-1=93, same.\n\nBut with 10 actions, we need an action at turn 93, but at turn 93, we are at y=9, and we can take action, say S, to stay at y=9 for turn 94, but we don't need to, since we already reached at turn 93.\n\nThe task is to reach at turn t_1 + H -1, and provide actions up to that point? No.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}, and after these H actions, we should be at position at turn t_1 + H -1? Confusion.\n\nAfter H actions, position is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nSo for the position at turn S = t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nS must be such that after actions up to a_{S-1}, y_S=9.\n\nThen the actions from a_{t_1} to a_{S-1}, number of actions: from t_1 to S-1, that's (S-1) - t_1 +1 = S - t_1 actions.\n\nThen S = t_1 + H -1, so S - t_1 = H -1.\n\nNumber of actions = H -1.\n\nAnd these actions are at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + (H-2) ? Let's index.\n\nThe actions are at times: t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to t_1 + k, where after that y at t_1 + k +1.\n\nSet t_1 + k +1 = S = t_1 + H -1, so k+1 = H-1, k = H-2.\n\nThen actions from time t_1 to t_1 + (H-2), that's H-1 actions? Times from t_1 to t_1 + m, number of actions is m+1.\n\nSet the last action at time T_last, then y at T_last +1.\n\nSet T_last +1 = S = t_1 + H -1, so T_last = t_1 + H -2.\n\nThen actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -2.\n\nNumber of actions: (t_1 + H -2) - t_1 +1 = H-1.\n\nAnd t from 0 to H-1 for the index, a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, but t=0 to H-1 corresponds to times t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, for S = t_1 + H -1, y_S=9, which is set by action at S-1.\n\nSo actions from a_{t_1} to a_{S-1}.\n\nS-1 = (t_1 + H -1) -1 = t_1 + H -2.\n\nSo actions at times t_1 to t_1 + H -2.\n\nIn the sequence index, a_{t_1 + t} for t from 0 to (H-2) - t_1? t from 0 to M, where t_1 + M = t_1 + H -2, so M = H-2.\n\nThus t from 0 to H-2, so H-1 actions? t from 0 to K inclusive, number is K+1.\n\nSet K = H-2, so t from 0 to H-2, number of actions = (H-2) - 0 +1 = H-1.\n\nAnd times t_1 to t_1 + H -2.\n\nThen y at t_1 + (H-2) +1 = t_1 + H -1 =9.\n\nIn our case, with y at t_1 +9 =9, so t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +9, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen actions at t from 0 to H-2 =8, so t=0 to 8, actions at t_1 to t_1+8.\n\nWhich is turns 84 to 92, as I had.\n\nWith actions: a_{84} to a_{92}, 9 actions.\n\nThen y at 93=9.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to 8 for H=10.\n\nAnswer format: for each turn, list the action.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 84: D\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nBut turn 92 is t_1 + 8, since t_1=84, 84+8=92.\n\nt from 0 to 8, that's 9 turns.\n\nIn the box, we need to write the actions.\n\nBut H=10, and sequence from t=0 to 8.\n\nNow, to write in the format.\n\nBut in the sequence, all after first are U, but we need to specify.\n\nPerhaps we can write it.\n\nBut is there a need for the last U? Yes, to reach y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 92, action U, from y=8 to y=9 at turn 93.\n\nNow, I think this is fine.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 7 and 8, unsafe at late times, but not relevant.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we could reach faster, but we can't.\n\nAnother point: at the beginning, we have to go down, but is there a way to go to y=3 later or something, but it would take more time.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, go down to y=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, stay at y=1, but y=1 safe at τ=1, then at τ=2, go to y=2, etc., but that adds a stay, so we reach later, at τ=10, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus minimal H=10 with the sequence above.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nWe need to write the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, from turn 85 to 92, all U, but we need to list each turn.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn 84: D\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nTurn 92: U\n\n}\n\nBut H=10, and turns from 84 to 92, that's 9 turns, but with t from 0 to 8, H=10.\n\nPerhaps it's acceptable.\n\nTo match, the last action is at turn 92, which is t_1 + 8, and since H=10, t_1 + (H-1) = t_1 +9, but action at t_1 +9 is not needed, as we reached at t_1+9.\n\nIn the sequence for t=0 to H-1=9, but action at t_1+9 would be for turn t_1+9, but at that turn, we are already at y=9, so action might be redundant, but we can set it to S or something, but not necessary.\n\nI think for minimal H, we should not include extra actions.\n\nIn this case, with 9 actions, we reach at turn 93, but turn 93 is t_1+9, and H-1=9, so it should be fine with H=10 and actions up to t=8.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps the problem allows the sequence to have exactly the actions to reach.\n\nIn the answer, we can write the sequence as above.\n\nNow, but in the car list, freeway 2 and 3 have cars, but we don't go there at unsafe times.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=2 at τ=2, safe.\n\ny=3 at τ=3, safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n\nTherefore, H=10, and the sequence:\n\nActions at turn 84: D\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nBut the turn numbers: t_1=84.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 84: D\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nAnd that's 9 lines, but for H=10, it should be up to turn 93? No.\n\nIn the sequence index, t from 0 to H-1=9, so turn t_1+9=93, but we don't have action there.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps the reach turn is included in the actions or something.\n\nAnother way: in some interpretations, the action at turn T determines the move, and position at T is before action.\n\nBut here, from the dynamics, position at T is given, then action a_T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision at T based on y_T.\n\nFor reaching, y_T=9 at T= t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn our case, T=93.\n\nActions from a_{84} to a_{92} set y_{85} to y_{93}.\n\ny_{93}=9.\n\nThe actions are at turns 84 to 92.\n\nFor the sequence, a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to 8, with H=10, t from 0 to 9? But t=9 would be a_{93}, which affects y_{94}, not needed.\n\nSo I think t from 0 to 8 for H=10 is correct, meaning H-1 actions, but H includes the turns or something.\n\nI think we should go with it.\n\nSo the minimal sequence is as above.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position \\((0, 2)\\) on turn \\(t_1 = 84\\) and must reach \\((0, 9)\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Initial Constraint**: At turn \\(t_1 = 84\\) (time offset \\(\\tau = 0\\)), the player is at \\(y = 2\\). Taking action \\(U\\) (up) or \\(S\\) (stay) leads to \\(y = 3\\) or \\(y = 2\\) at \\(\\tau = 1\\), respectively. However, freeway \\(y = 2\\) is unsafe at \\(\\tau = 1\\) due to a car collision, and \\(y = 3\\) is also unsafe at \\(\\tau = 1\\). The only safe action is \\(D\\) (down), moving to \\(y = 1\\) at \\(\\tau = 1\\), where freeway \\(y = 1\\) is safe at \\(\\tau = 1\\).\n- **Path to \\(y = 9\\)**: From \\(y = 1\\) at \\(\\tau = 1\\), the player must increase \\(y\\) by 8 to reach \\(y = 9\\). This requires at least 8 up moves. The straight path upward is feasible without collisions:\n  - At \\(\\tau = 2\\), \\(y = 2\\) is safe (unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 1\\)).\n  - At \\(\\tau = 3\\), \\(y = 3\\) is safe (unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 1\\)).\n  - At \\(\\tau = 4\\), \\(y = 4\\) is safe (unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 1\\)).\n  - At \\(\\tau = 5\\), \\(y = 5\\) is safe (unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 1\\)).\n  - At \\(\\tau = 6\\), \\(y = 6\\) is safe (unsafe at \\(\\tau = 3\\) and \\(4\\), but \\(\\tau = 6\\) is later).\n  - At \\(\\tau = 7\\), \\(y = 7\\) is safe (unsafe at \\(\\tau = 11, 12, 13\\), but \\(\\tau = 7\\) is earlier).\n  - At \\(\\tau = 8\\), \\(y = 8\\) is safe (unsafe at \\(\\tau = 11, 12, 13, 14\\), but \\(\\tau = 8\\) is earlier).\n  - At \\(\\tau = 9\\), \\(y = 9\\) is reached, which is always safe (no freeway).\n- **Minimal Turns \\(H\\)**: The player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + 9 = 93\\). Since \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 93\\), solving for \\(H\\) gives \\(84 + H - 1 = 93\\), so \\(H = 10\\).

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0,1) on turn t_1 = 85. The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. Each turn, the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-coordinate by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn T. Importantly, if the player moves to a different y at turn T, they are not on that new y until the next turn, so they only check the car on the current y at the start of the turn.\n\nThe car positions are given for turn t_1=85, and they move over time based on their speed and direction. Left-moving cars decrease their position, right-moving increase.\n\nI need to find the minimal H and a sequence of actions from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1 such that after H turns, y = 9.\n\nStarting from y=1 at turn 85.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each future turn relative to x=0.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=0 for simplicity, where t=0 corresponds to turn t_1=85. So at time t (turns after t_1), the player position is y_t, and we need y_H = 9 for some H.\n\nCars: for each freeway k (1 to 8), there are cars listed with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: \"left\" means decreasing x, \"right\" means increasing x. And span is given as [head, tail] or [tail, head] depending on direction? In the update, for left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ] then at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: span(t_1) = [τ, h]? No, it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving? Let's read carefully.\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nBut [h, τ] with h and τ, which is head and tail? I think head is the front, so for left-moving, head is larger or smaller? Typically, for left-moving, head is at smaller x, but let's see the values.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (48, 1, right, 48) — direction right, so head should be larger? But it says (48,1), and span for right-moving is given as [τ, h]? No.\n\nIn the car state table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nThen for update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t_1) is [τ, h], which might imply τ is left end, h is right end, so for right-moving, τ ≤ h, and span is from τ to h.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], but if moving left, h should be the front, so if moving left, h > τ probably, so span from h to τ decreasing? But [h, τ] with h > τ would be decreasing, but in interval notation, [h, τ] might not make sense if h>τ, but it's a set, so it's the positions from min to max.\n\nI think it's better to think of the span as the set of positions covered, so for collision, we care about whether 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nFor a car, at turn T, the span is:\n\nIf left-moving: [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)] , and since it's moving left, h - sΔT and τ - sΔT, so the span is from min to max.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], from min to max.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, if [h, τ] is given and h and τ, if h > τ, then [τ, h] would be the interval, but it says [h, τ], so if h > τ, it might be decreasing, but for span, it's the values, so we should take min and max.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's define the position at turn T.\n\nLet Δt = T - t_1.\n\nFor a car on freeway k at t_1:\n\n- If direction left: the span at T is [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\n- If direction right: the span at T is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nThen, collision on freeway k at turn T if the player is on y=k at turn T and 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nNow, player is on y_t at turn t (relative time, t=0 at t_1).\n\nWe start at y_0 = 1.\n\nGoal: y_H = 9 for some H.\n\nActions: U, D, S, each changing y by +1, -1, 0, with y clamped to [0,9].\n\nSince we start at y=1 and want to go to y=9, we need to move up, so U actions are needed, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, but since we need to go up, moving down might not be efficient, but sometimes necessary to dodge.\n\nBut to minimize H, we probably want to go up as fast as possible, only deviating when necessary to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway at t_1=85 (Δt=0).\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=48, τ=1, d=right, s=48)\n\nSince right-moving, span at t_1: [τ + s*0, h + s*0] = [1,48]\n\nAt time T, span = [1 + 48 Δt, 48 + 48 Δt] = [1 + 48Δt, 48 + 48Δt]\n\nCollision on freeway 1 at turn T if player on y=1 and 0 in [1+48Δt, 48+48Δt]\n\nBut 0 in [1+48Δt, 48+48Δt] only if 1+48Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 48+48Δt, but since 1+48Δt ≥1 >0 for Δt≥0, so 0 is never in this interval because min is at least 1. So no collision possible on freeway 1 at any time, since the car is always to the right of 0.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars: (0, -11, right, 12) and (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=12\n\nRight-moving, span at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-11 + 12 Δt, 0 + 12 Δt] = [-11 + 12Δt, 12Δt]\n\nSecond car: h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=12, span at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-59 + 12 Δt, -48 + 12 Δt]\n\nCollision on freeway 2 at turn T if player on y=2 and 0 in span of either car.\n\nFirst car: 0 in [-11+12Δt, 12Δt] which requires -11+12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 12Δt, so 0 ≤ 12Δt and -11+12Δt ≤ 0, so 12Δt ≥0 (always for Δt≥0) and 12Δt ≤ 11? Let's solve:\n\n-11 +12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 12Δt\n\nLeft: -11 +12Δt ≤ 0 => 12Δt ≤ 11 => Δt ≤ 11/12\n\nRight: 0 ≤ 12Δt => Δt ≥ 0\n\nSo for Δt between 0 and 11/12, 0 is in [-11+12Δt, 12Δt] when 12Δt ≤ 11, i.e., Δt ≤ 11/12, but since Δt integer? Turns are discrete, Δt integer.\n\nΔt = T - t_1, integer.\n\nSo for Δt = 0: 0 in [-11,0]? -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, yes, 0 ≤ 0 is true.\n\nFor Δt=0: first car span [-11,0], 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, at Δt=0: 12*0=0, -11+0=-11, so [-11,0], 0 is in it.\n\nAt Δt=1: [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12].\n\nSimilarly, second car: span at T: [-59 +12Δt, -48 +12Δt]\n\nFor 0 to be in this: -59+12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48+12Δt\n\nLeft: -59+12Δt ≤ 0 => 12Δt ≤ 59 => Δt ≤ 59/12 ≈4.916, so Δt ≤4 since integer\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -48+12Δt => 48 ≤ 12Δt => Δt ≥ 4\n\nSo for Δt=4: -59+48 = -11, -48+48=0, so [-11,0], 0 in it\n\nΔt=5: [-59+60=1, -48+60=12], [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo for freeway 2:\n\nFirst car: collision when Δt=0 (since 0 in [-11,0])\n\nSecond car: collision when Δt=4 (0 in [-11,0])\n\nNow, both cars on same freeway, so at turn T, if player on y=2, collision if either car has 0 in span.\n\nAt Δt=0: first car has 0, collision.\n\nAt Δt=4: second car has 0, collision.\n\nOther times, no collision from these cars.\n\nFirst car at Δt=0 only, since at Δt=1, [1,12] no 0.\n\nSecond car only at Δt=4.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Cars: (0, -11, right, 12) and (-48, -59, right, 12) — identical to freeway 2.\n\nSo same collision times: at Δt=0 and Δt=4 for y=3? Freeway 3.\n\nFreeway k=3.\n\nSo for y=3, collision at Δt=0 and Δt=4.\n\nBut player starts at y=1 at t=0, not on y=2 or y=3 yet.\n\nNow freeway 4: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so span at T: [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] = [-24 -36 Δt, 11 -36 Δt]\n\nh= -24, τ=11, left-moving, so span at T: [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] = [-24 -36 Δt, 11 -36 Δt]\n\nCollision if 0 in this interval: -24 -36Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 11 -36Δt\n\nNow, left inequality: -24 -36Δt ≤ 0 always true since negative.\n\nRight inequality: 0 ≤ 11 -36Δt => 36Δt ≤ 11 => Δt ≤ 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so only for Δt=0\n\nAt Δt=0: [-24,11], 0 in [-24,11], yes.\n\nAt Δt=1: [-24-36, 11-36] = [-60, -25], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at Δt=0, collision on freeway 4 if player there.\n\nBut freeway 4 is y=4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as 4, (-24, 11, left, 36) — identical, so collision only at Δt=0 for y=5.\n\nNow freeway 6: (-12, -23, right, 6)\n\nDirection right, so span at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-23 +6 Δt, -12 +6 Δt]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-23+6Δt, -12+6Δt]\n\nSo -23+6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -12+6Δt\n\nLeft: -23+6Δt ≤ 0 => 6Δt ≤ 23 => Δt ≤ 23/6 ≈3.833, Δt ≤3\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -12+6Δt => 12 ≤ 6Δt => Δt ≥ 2\n\nSo for Δt=2: -23+12= -11, -12+12=0, so [-11,0], 0 in it\n\nΔt=3: -23+18= -5, -12+18=6, [-5,6], 0 in it? -5 ≤ 0 ≤ 6, yes.\n\nΔt=4: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for y=6, collision when Δt=2 or 3.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars: (-40, -51, right, 4) and (24, 13, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: h=-40, τ=-51? Cars: (-40, -51, right, 4) and (24, 13, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: τ=-51, h=-40, d=right, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-51 +4 Δt, -40 +4 Δt]\n\n0 in this: -51+4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -40+4Δt\n\nLeft: -51+4Δt ≤ 0 => 4Δt ≤ 51 => Δt ≤ 51/4=12.75, Δt≤12\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -40+4Δt => 40 ≤ 4Δt => Δt ≥10\n\nSo for Δt=10,11,12.\n\nΔt=10: [-51+40, -40+40] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔt=11: [-51+44, -40+44] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nΔt=12: [-51+48, -40+48] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nΔt=13: [-51+52, -40+52] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSecond car: (24,13, right,4) — h=24, τ=13? Or is it head and tail?\n\nCars: (head h, tail τ), so (24,13, right,4), direction right, so span at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [13 +4 Δt, 24 +4 Δt]\n\n0 in [13+4Δt, 24+4Δt]? Since min is 13+4Δt ≥13>0 for Δt≥0, so never contains 0. Always positive.\n\nSo only first car can cause collision on y=7.\n\nCollision when Δt=10,11,12.\n\nFinally freeway 8: (-30, -41, right, 3)\n\nCars: (-30, -41, right, 3) — h=-30, τ=-41? Head and tail.\n\nDirection right, span at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-41 +3 Δt, -30 +3 Δt]\n\n0 in this: -41+3Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -30+3Δt\n\nLeft: -41+3Δt ≤ 0 => 3Δt ≤ 41 => Δt ≤ 41/3≈13.666, Δt≤13\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -30+3Δt => 30 ≤ 3Δt => Δt ≥10\n\nSo for Δt=10 to 13.\n\nΔt=10: [-41+30, -30+30] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔt=11: [-41+33, -30+33] = [-8,3], 0 in\n\nΔt=12: [-41+36, -30+36] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔt=13: [-41+39, -30+39] = [-2,9], 0 in\n\nΔt=14: [-41+42, -30+42] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when collision occurs if player is on that y at turn Δt.\n\n- y=1: no collision possible, as car always right of 0.\n\n- y=2: collision at Δt=0 and Δt=4\n\n- y=3: same as y=2, collision at Δt=0 and Δt=4\n\n- y=4: collision at Δt=0 only\n\n- y=5: collision at Δt=0 only\n\n- y=6: collision at Δt=2 and Δt=3\n\n- y=7: collision at Δt=10,11,12\n\n- y=8: collision at Δt=10,11,12,13\n\ny=9 is the goal, no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at y=1, Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt=0, player is on y=1, which has no collision, so safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe direct way: move up as much as possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on certain y at certain times.\n\nSince we start at y=1, and need to reach y=9, minimum steps if no obstacles is 8 steps: U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U to go from 1 to 9 in 8 moves.\n\nBut with obstacles, we might need to delay or detour.\n\nBut detour down might cost more steps, so probably better to stay or move slower to avoid collision times.\n\nSince we can only move one step per turn, and y changes slowly.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nStart at t=0, y=1.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some H.\n\nSince from y=1 to y=9, we must increase y by 8, so we need at least 8 up moves. Each S or D would add a turn without progress, so minimal H is at least 8, but could be more if we need to wait.\n\nNow, the dangerous times:\n\nFor y=2: avoid at Δt=0 and Δt=4\n\ny=3: avoid at Δt=0 and Δt=4\n\ny=4: avoid at Δt=0\n\ny=5: avoid at Δt=0\n\ny=6: avoid at Δt=2 and 3\n\ny=7: avoid at Δt=10,11,12\n\ny=8: avoid at Δt=10,11,12,13\n\nSince we start at Δt=0, y=1, safe.\n\nWe cannot go to y=2 at Δt=0 because collision, but at Δt=0 we are at y=1, not moving yet? Turn t_1: we are at position, and we choose action for this turn.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn T, player is at position y_T.\n\nThen we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nThen, during turn T, we are on freeway y_T, and we check collision based on cars at that turn T.\n\nAfter action, we move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo for turn T, we are on y_T, and collision if for freeway y_T, 0 in some car's span at T.\n\nIn this case, at turn t_1 (T=t_1, Δt=0), player on y=1, which is safe, as we said.\n\nNow, we choose action a_{t_1} for this turn.\n\nIf we choose U, we go to y=2 at next turn, but during this turn, we are still on y=1, safe.\n\nThen at next turn, Δt=1, we are on y=2 if we moved up.\n\nBut at Δt=1, for y=2, is there collision? Earlier for y=2, collision only at Δt=0 and 4, not at Δt=1.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 only at Δt=0 and 4.\n\ny=4 at Δt=0 only, so for Δt>0, y=4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly y=5 safe for Δt>0.\n\ny=6: collision at Δt=2 and 3, so avoid at t=2 and t=3 relative.\n\ny=7 and 8 have collisions later around Δt=10-13.\n\nFirst, since we start at y=1, Δt=0.\n\nWe can choose to go up to y=2 immediately or stay or down, but down to y=0 might not help.\n\ny=0 is bottom, but we need to go up, so probably not useful.\n\nSo likely, we should move up when possible.\n\nAt turn Δt=0, we are on y=1, safe. We can choose U to go to y=2 for next turn.\n\nIf we choose U at t=0, then at turn Δt=1, we are on y=2.\n\nNow at Δt=1, y=2: no collision, since only collision at Δt=0 and 4 for y=2.\n\nSimilarly, we can go to y=3 at Δt=2.\n\nAt Δt=2, y=3: collision at Δt=0 and 4, not at 2, so safe.\n\nThen to y=4 at Δt=3.\n\nAt Δt=3, y=4: collision only at Δt=0, so at Δt=3>0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, to y=5 at Δt=4.\n\nAt Δt=4, y=5: collision only at Δt=0, so at Δt=4, safe.\n\nNow to y=6 at Δt=5.\n\nBut y=6 has collision at Δt=2 and 3.\n\nAt Δt=5, y=6: no collision, since only 2 and 3.\n\nSimilarly, then to y=7 at Δt=6, and so on.\n\nBut we have later collisions on y=7 and y=8.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can go directly up.\n\nStart: t=0 (Δt=0), y=1, safe. Action U, so y_1=2 for next turn.\n\nTurn t=1 (Δt=1), y=2, safe (no collision at Δt=1). Action U, y_2=3.\n\nTurn t=2 (Δt=2), y=3, safe? At Δt=2, y=3 collision? For y=3, collision at Δt=0 and Δt=4.\n\nΔt=2 not collision, so safe. Action U, y_3=4.\n\nTurn t=3 (Δt=3), y=4, safe (collision only at Δt=0). Action U, y_4=5.\n\nTurn t=4 (Δt=4), y=5, safe (collision only at Δt=0). Action U, y_5=6.\n\nNow turn t=5 (Δt=5), y=6. y=6 collision at Δt=2 and 3, not at 5, so safe. Action U, y_6=7.\n\nTurn t=6 (Δt=6), y=7. Now y=7 collision at Δt=10,11,12. Δt=6 not in, so safe. Action U, y_7=8.\n\nTurn t=7 (Δt=7), y=8. y=8 collision at Δt=10,11,12,13. Δt=7 not in, so safe. Action U, y_8=9.\n\nNow turn t=8 (Δt=8), y=9, which is goal, and no cars on y=9, so safe.\n\nWe reached y=9 at turn t=8, which is H=9 turns? Let's see the turns.\n\nWe start at turn t_1=85, which is t=0 relative.\n\nAfter H turns, we have done actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and position at t_1 + H -1 is y=9.\n\nIn terms of time: at time t (relative), after action, position for next turn.\n\nDefine:\n\nLet t be the turn index relative to start, t=0,1,2,... for turns t_1, t_1+1, t_1+2,...\n\nAt the start of turn t (which is turn t_1 + t), player is at y_t.\n\nThen we choose action a_t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nDuring turn t, we are on y_t, and check collision for that position and time.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t = H (start of turn H), player is at y_H.\n\nWe want y_H = 9 for some H.\n\nSince we start at y_0 =1, and we want y_H=9, we need to increase y by 8, so minimal H is 8 if we move up every turn, but y_H = y_0 + sum of Δy up to t=H-1.\n\ny_H is position at start of turn H.\n\ny_0 =1 at turn 0.\n\nAfter action a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{H-1}, y_H = y_{H-1} + Δy_{H-1}\n\nAnd we want y_H =9.\n\nSince y_0=1, we need the sum of Δy from t=0 to t=H-1 to be 8, each Δy in {-1,0,1}, so number of U minus number of D must be 8, and H = number of actions.\n\nMinimal H when no S or D, all U, so H=8 actions, y_8=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, with all U:\n\nTurn 0 (t_1): at y=1, action U, so y1=2\n\nTurn 1: at y=2, action U, y2=3\n\nTurn 2: at y=3, action U, y3=4\n\nTurn 3: at y=4, action U, y4=5\n\nTurn 4: at y=5, action U, y5=6\n\nTurn 5: at y=6, action U, y6=7\n\nTurn 6: at y=7, action U, y7=8\n\nTurn 7: at y=8, action U, y8=9\n\nNow, we need to check for each turn, when on a freeway y_t, no collision at time t (relative time).\n\nTurn t=0 (Δt=0): y=1, safe, no collision possible.\n\nTurn t=1 (Δt=1): y=2, collision at Δt=0 and 4, not 1, safe.\n\nTurn t=2 (Δt=2): y=3, collision at Δt=0 and 4, not 2, safe.\n\nTurn t=3 (Δt=3): y=4, collision only at Δt=0, not 3, safe.\n\nTurn t=4 (Δt=4): y=5, collision only at Δt=0, not 4, safe.\n\nTurn t=5 (Δt=5): y=6, collision at Δt=2 and 3, not 5, safe.\n\nTurn t=6 (Δt=6): y=7, collision at Δt=10,11,12, not 6, safe.\n\nTurn t=7 (Δt=7): y=8, collision at Δt=10,11,12,13, not 7, safe.\n\nThen at turn t=8 (Δt=8), y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nSo with H=8, we reach y=9 at turn t=8, and no collisions.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=6 has collision at Δt=2 and 3, but we are on y=6 at t=5, Δt=5, not 2 or 3, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and 8 at t=6 and7, Δt=6 and7, before the collision times 10-13.\n\nSo it seems we can reach in 8 turns with all U actions.\n\nBut is that correct?\n\nThe collision times for y=7 and 8 are at Δt=10-13, which is later, so we are passing through before that.\n\nSimilarly, for y=2 and 3, we are at Δt=1 and 2, avoiding Δt=0 and 4.\n\ny=4 and5 at Δt=3 and4, avoiding Δt=0.\n\ny=6 at Δt=5, avoiding Δt=2,3.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,1) at turn t_1=85, and we need to reach (0,9).\n\nIn this sequence, we are at y=9 at turn t_1 + 8? Let's see.\n\nRelative turn t=0: actual turn t_1=85, position y=1\n\nAfter action a_0=U, y1=2 at turn t_1+1=86\n\n...\n\nAt turn t=7: actual turn t_1+7=92, position y=8, action U, so at turn t_1+8=93, position y=9.\n\nWe need to be at position (0,9) at some turn, which is when y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_H.\n\nWe have actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nFor H=8, actions at t=85 to 92, position at t=93 is y=9.\n\nAnd during turns 85 to 92, we were on various y, but as above, no collision at those times.\n\nFor example, turn 85: on y=1, safe\n\nTurn 86: on y=2, Δt=1 (since t_1=85, turn 86 is Δt=1), safe\n\nΔt is T - t_1, so for turn T, Δt = T - 85.\n\nTurn 85: Δt=0\n\nTurn 86: Δt=1\n\n...\n\nTurn 93: Δt=8\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 85 (Δt=0): y=1, safe\n\nTurn 86 (Δt=1): y=2, for y=2 collision only at Δt=0 and 4, Δt=1 safe\n\nTurn 87 (Δt=2): y=3, for y=3 collision at Δt=0 and 4, Δt=2 safe\n\nTurn 88 (Δt=3): y=4, collision only at Δt=0, Δt=3 safe\n\nTurn 89 (Δt=4): y=5, collision only at Δt=0, Δt=4 safe? Δt=4, for y=5, collision only at Δt=0, so at Δt=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 90 (Δt=5): y=6, collision at Δt=2 and 3, Δt=5 safe\n\nTurn 91 (Δt=6): y=7, collision at Δt=10,11,12, Δt=6 safe\n\nTurn 92 (Δt=7): y=8, collision at Δt=10,11,12,13, Δt=7 safe\n\nThen turn 93 (Δt=8): y=9, no car, safe.\n\nAnd we reached at turn 93.\n\nH=8 actions: from turn 85 to 92.\n\nBut the position is reached at turn 93.\n\nThe minimal H should be 8.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and \"sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\" such that after H turns, position is (0,9).\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nIn this case, with H=8, we have it.\n\nBut is there a way with H<8? No, because from y=1 to y=9, need at least 8 up moves, so H at least 8.\n\nWith all U, we can do it in H=8.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 2 and 3, at Δt=4, there is collision, but we are not on y=2 or 3 at Δt=4.\n\nAt Δt=4, we are on y=5 in the sequence, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 6 at Δt=2 and 3.\n\nAt Δt=2, we were on y=3, not y=6.\n\nAt Δt=3, on y=4, not y=6.\n\nSo all fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 8, with all U actions.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, all actions are U.\n\nBut let's write it for the turns.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{85} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{86} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +7: a_{92} = U\n\nt_1=85, so actions from t=85 to 92.\n\nt from 0 to 7, 8 actions.\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case, H=8.\n\nBut is there any reason we cannot do this?\n\nPerhaps at some point, we need to avoid, but in this case, it seems fine.\n\nMaybe I missed something.\n\nAnother thing: when moving, if we move to a different y, we are not on that y until next turn, so for example, at turn T, if we are on y_T, and we move to y_{T+1} = y_T +1, during turn T, we are on y_T, not y_T+1, so we don't check cars on y_T+1 at turn T.\n\nIn this sequence, we never on dangerous positions at dangerous times.\n\nFor instance, at turn 89, which is Δt=4, we are on y=5, and for y=5, collision only at Δt=0, so safe.\n\nBut at Δt=4, for freeway 2, there is a car with 0 in span, but we are not on y=2, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly for y=3 at Δt=4.\n\nAll good.\n\nTherefore, we can reach in 8 turns with all U.\n\nSo the sequence is all U for 8 turns.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nH=8\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nThen at turn 93, position (0,9).\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  (which is U)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1}  (U)\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 +7: a_{t_1+7}  (U)\n\nSince H=8, actions from t=0 to 7 relative.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1=7.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 85: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 89: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 90: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 91: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 92: & U \\end{array} }\n\nBut in text, it might be written as above.\n\nBut is H minimal? Yes, 8.\n\nBut earlier I thought about the later collisions, but since we pass before, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can do with S or something, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nFor example, if we stayed at some point, H>8.\n\nSo this should be minimal.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 7 and 8.\n\nAt turn 91 (Δt=6), y=7, collision at Δt=10,11,12, not 6, safe.\n\nTurn 92 (Δt=7), y=8, collision at Δt=10,11,12,13, not 7, safe.\n\nAnd we move to y=9 at next turn.\n\nIf we were later, we might hit, but we are early.\n\nSimilarly, for y=6, at turn 90 (Δt=5), safe.\n\nBut at Δt=2 and 3, y=6 has collision, but we are on y=3 and 4 at those times.\n\nAll seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 8, with all U actions.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 85\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The minimum number of turns required to move from \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is 8, as each \"U\" action increases the y-coordinate by 1, and no fewer actions can achieve this net increase.\n- Collision occurs only if, at turn \\(T\\), the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) and the position \\(x = 0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n- The car positions and collision times (relative to \\(t_1 = 85\\)) for each freeway are:\n  - \\(y = 1\\): No collision possible (car always right of 0).\n  - \\(y = 2\\): Collision at \\(\\Delta t = 0\\) and \\(\\Delta t = 4\\).\n  - \\(y = 3\\): Collision at \\(\\Delta t = 0\\) and \\(\\Delta t = 4\\).\n  - \\(y = 4\\): Collision only at \\(\\Delta t = 0\\).\n  - \\(y = 5\\): Collision only at \\(\\Delta t = 0\\).\n  - \\(y = 6\\): Collision at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\) and \\(\\Delta t = 3\\).\n  - \\(y = 7\\): Collision at \\(\\Delta t = 10, 11, 12\\).\n  - \\(y = 8\\): Collision at \\(\\Delta t = 10, 11, 12, 13\\).\n- A sequence of all \"U\" actions allows the player to reach \\(y = 9\\) in 8 turns, and the path avoids all collisions:\n  - At turn 85 (\\(\\Delta t = 0\\)): On \\(y = 1\\), safe.\n  - At turn 86 (\\(\\Delta t = 1\\)): On \\(y = 2\\), safe (no collision at \\(\\Delta t = 1\\)).\n  - At turn 87 (\\(\\Delta t = 2\\)): On \\(y = 3\\), safe (no collision at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\)).\n  - At turn 88 (\\(\\Delta t = 3\\)): On \\(y = 4\\), safe (no collision at \\(\\Delta t = 3\\)).\n  - At turn 89 (\\(\\Delta t = 4\\)): On \\(y = 5\\), safe (no collision at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\)).\n  - At turn 90 (\\(\\Delta t = 5\\)): On \\(y = 6\\), safe (no collision at \\(\\Delta t = 5\\)).\n  - At turn 91 (\\(\\Delta t = 6\\)): On \\(y = 7\\), safe (no collision at \\(\\Delta t = 6\\)).\n  - At turn 92 (\\(\\Delta t = 7\\)): On \\(y = 8\\), safe (no collision at \\(\\Delta t = 7\\)).\n  - At turn 93 (\\(\\Delta t = 8\\)): On \\(y = 9\\), goal reached (no cars on \\(y = 9\\)).\n- This sequence achieves \\(y = 9\\) in \\(H = 8\\) turns, which is minimal since fewer turns cannot increase y by 8.\n\n### Minimal Turns and Action Sequence:\n- \\(H = 8\\)\n- Actions from turn \\(t_1 = 85\\) to turn \\(t_1 + 7 = 92\\):\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 85: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 89: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 90: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 91: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 92: & U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 86. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right with given speeds, and I need to avoid being on a freeway where a car spans x=0 at that turn. Importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I only care about cars on my current y at each turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn number relative to t₁. So at τ = 0 (which is turn t₁), I'm at y=2.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions for τ = 0 to H-1 such that at τ = H-1, y = 9.\n\nFirst, I need to model where the cars are at each future turn relative to t₁.\n\nFor a car, at time T (absolute turn), its position depends on the initial state at t₁ and the elapsed time.\n\nSince t₁ is fixed, let Δt = T - t₁, so for future turns, Δt ≥ 0.\n\nFor each car, given its head, tail, direction, and speed at t₁, I can find where it is at time Δt later.\n\nThe span is given for turn t₁. For left-moving cars, span moves left, for right-moving, it moves right.\n\nFor example, a right-moving car with span [τ, h] at t₁, at Δt later, span is [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h - s*Δt, τ - s*Δt], but in the car state, for left-moving, it's given as (h, τ, left, s), and since it's moving left, head is decreasing.\n\nIn the table, for each car, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nI need to interpret head and tail correctly.\n\nFor a right-moving car, head is the front, which is larger x, tail is smaller x, so span is [tail, head].\n\nIn the update rule, for right-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\"\n\nIt says [τ, h] for Span(t₁), and τ is tail, h is head? But in the notation, it's (head, tail, dir, speed) in the table.\n\nLook at the car state table:\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (96, 49, right, 48)\n\nSo head=96, tail=49, direction=right.\n\nIn the update, for right-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] which should be [tail, head] = [49, 96] I think.\n\nBut in the text it says \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h]\" and τ is tail, h is head? Let's see the symbols.\n\nIn the car update rules:\n\n\"for car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t₁\"\n\nThen for left-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\"\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\"\n\nSo for right-moving, Span(t₁) = [tail, head], and for left-moving, Span(t₁) = [head, tail]? That seems inconsistent.\n\nLet's read carefully:\n\nLeft-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\"\n\nSince it's moving left, head decreases.\n\nRight-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\"\n\nSo for both, Span(t₁) is given with the smaller number first? For left-moving, [h, τ] with h and τ, but head and tail, which is smaller?\n\nIn left-moving, since it's moving left, head should be larger x, I assume, so [h, τ] might have h > τ or h < τ? I think I need to assume that for a car, tail is always less than head in terms of position, but direction indicates the movement.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's look at the values.\n\nTake freeway 1: head=96, tail=49, direction=right. Since it's right-moving, tail should be left, head right, so tail=49, head=96, so span at t₁ is [49,96] for x-coordinates.\n\nIn the right-moving update, Span(t₁) = [τ, h] = [49,96], then at T, [49 + s Δt, 96 + s Δt].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, e.g. freeway 4: (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nHead=-60, tail=-25, direction=left.\n\nSince left-moving, head should be smaller x if it's moving left, so head=-60, tail=-25, so span at t₁ is [head, tail] = [-60, -25]? But in the update rule for left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] = [-60, -25], then at T, [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] = [-60 - s Δt, -25 - s Δt].\n\nNow, collision occurs if for a car on freeway y_T, at turn T, 0 is in Span(T), meaning min(span) ≤ 0 ≤ max(span).\n\nSince span is an interval, 0 is in [low, high] if low ≤ 0 ≤ high.\n\nFor each freeway and each car on it, I need to find when 0 is covered by the car at time Δt relative to t₁.\n\nSince the player is at a specific y at each turn, I only care about cars on that y at that turn.\n\nBut y changes with actions, so I need to plan the path.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per freeway, since multiple cars can be on one freeway.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (96, 49, right, 48) so at t₁, span [49,96], right-moving.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars: (12,1,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=12, tail=1, right, so span [1,12] at t₁.\n\nSecond car: head=-36, tail=-47? Tail=-47, head=-36, so since right-moving, tail should be left, so tail=-47, head=-36, so span [-47,-36] at t₁.\n\nBoth right-moving, speed 12.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? \" (12,1,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12) \" identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: (-60,-25,left,36) head=-60, tail=-25, left-moving, so span [h,τ] = [-60,-25] at t₁.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4? \"(-60,-25,left,36)\" identical.\n\nFreeway 6: (-6,-17,right,6) head=-6, tail=-17? Tail=-17, head=-6, right-moving, so span [-17,-6] at t₁.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-36,-47,right,4) and (28,17,right,4)\n\nFirst: head=-36, tail=-47, right, span [-47,-36]\n\nSecond: head=28, tail=17, right, span [17,28]\n\nFreeway 8: (-27,-38,right,3) head=-27, tail=-38, right, span [-38,-27]\n\nNow, for each car, I need to find when it covers x=0 at its freeway.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway i, and time Δt, if there is a car on i such that 0 in its span at Δt.\n\nBut since multiple cars, I need to check all on that freeway.\n\nCollision occurs if for the y I am on at turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 in Span(T) for that car.\n\nSpan(T) depends on Δt = T - t₁.\n\nLet δ = Δt for simplicity.\n\nFor each freeway, the times when it is dangerous, i.e., some car covers x=0.\n\nThen, when I am at y at time δ, I collide if y has a car that covers x=0 at that δ.\n\nBut y is the freeway number.\n\nNow, since the player moves vertically, I need to avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nNow, for each freeway, find the set of δ where min_span ≤ 0 ≤ max_span for some car on that freeway.\n\nThen, for my path, at each step δ, y_δ must not be in a dangerous freeway at that δ.\n\ny_δ is my y-position at time δ relative to t₁.\n\nStart at δ=0, y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some δ=H-1.\n\nActions U, D, S change y by +1, -1, 0, bounded to [0,9].\n\nSince I start at y=2 and need to go to y=9, I need to go up, so U actions are necessary, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nThe minimal H would be if I go directly up, but I might hit cars, so I need to check when the freeways are safe.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway the times when it is blocked, i.e., some car at x=0.\n\nDefine for each freeway i, the set of δ ≥ 0 where freeway i has a collision possible, meaning 0 is covered.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, the coverage is periodic or has intervals, but because speeds are different, it might be specific intervals.\n\nFor each car, the condition 0 in span at δ.\n\nFor a car, span at δ depends on direction.\n\nFirst, right-moving car: span at δ: [τ + s δ, h + s δ]\n\n0 in [τ + s δ, h + s δ] iff τ + s δ ≤ 0 ≤ h + s δ\n\nSince τ ≤ h, this implies:\n\nτ + s δ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s δ, so s δ ≤ -τ and s δ ≥ -h\n\nSimilarly, left-moving car: span at δ: [h - s δ, τ - s δ]\n\n0 in [h - s δ, τ - s δ] iff h - s δ ≤ 0 ≤ τ - s δ\n\nSince h ≤ τ for left-moving? In our earlier, for left-moving, at t₁, [h, τ] with h and τ, but in the example, h=-60, τ=-25, so h < τ, so min is h, max is τ.\n\nGenerally, for left-moving, min_span = h - s δ, max_span = τ - s δ, with h < τ.\n\nSo 0 in [h - s δ, τ - s δ] iff h - s δ ≤ 0 ≤ τ - s δ\n\nWhich is s δ ≥ h and s δ ≤ τ? Let's solve inequalities.\n\nh - s δ ≤ 0 ⇒ s δ ≥ h (since s>0, δ≥0)\n\n0 ≤ τ - s δ ⇒ s δ ≤ τ\n\nSo s δ ≥ h and s δ ≤ τ\n\nBut h and τ could be negative, etc.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nNow, for each car, we can find the δ where it covers x=0.\n\nThen for a freeway, it is dangerous at δ if any car on it covers x=0 at that δ.\n\nSince cars don't interact, we can find the union over cars on that freeway.\n\nNow, let's list per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, right-moving, s=48, τ=49, h=96\n\n0 in [49 + 48 δ, 96 + 48 δ]\n\nSo 49 + 48 δ ≤ 0 ≤ 96 + 48 δ\n\nBut 49 + 48δ ≤0 implies δ ≤ -49/48 <0, since δ≥0, this is impossible. Similarly, 0≤96+48δ always true for δ≥0. So the first inequality never holds, so 0 never in span for this car. Because the car is at [49,96] at δ=0, moving right, so it will never cover x=0, since min is 49>0 and increasing. So freeway 1 is always safe? At δ=0, min=49>0, so 0 not covered, and moving away. Yes, so freeway 1 has no collision at any time. Good.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (12,1,right,12), so τ=1, h=12, s=12\n\n0 in [1 + 12δ, 12 + 12δ]\n\nSo 1 + 12δ ≤ 0 ≤ 12 + 12δ\n\nNow, 1+12δ ≤0 ⇒ δ ≤ -1/12 <0, impossible.\n\n0 ≤ 12+12δ always true.\n\nSo never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (-36,-47,right,12), head=-36, tail=-47? τ=tail=-47, h=head=-36, s=12\n\nSpan: [-47 +12δ, -36 +12δ]\n\n0 in this iff -47 +12δ ≤ 0 ≤ -36 +12δ\n\nWhich is:\n\n-47 +12δ ≤ 0 ⇒ 12δ ≤ 47 ⇒ δ ≤ 47/12 = 3.9167\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -36 +12δ ⇒ 12δ ≥ 36 ⇒ δ ≥ 3\n\nSo for δ between 3 and 47/12 ≈3.9167, so δ=3? δ must be integer? Turns are discrete, so δ integer.\n\nδ is number of turns, so integer δ ≥0.\n\nSo 12δ ≥ 36 ⇒ δ ≥ 3\n\n12δ ≤ 47 ⇒ δ ≤ 47/12 = 3 + 11/12, so since δ integer, δ ≤ 3\n\nδ ≤ floor(47/12) = 3, since 47/12=3.916, floor=3.\n\nBut δ ≥3 and δ ≤3, so only at δ=3.\n\nCheck:\n\nAt δ=3, span: [-47 +12*3, -36 +12*3] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0]\n\n0 is included, since upper bound is 0.\n\n0 ≤ 0 is true.\n\nAt δ=2, span: [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23, -12], min=-23, max=-12, both <0, 0 not in.\n\nAt δ=4, span: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], min=1>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at δ=3, this car covers x=0.\n\nNow, first car never covers, so for freeway 2, it is dangerous only at δ=3.\n\nBecause only this car at that time.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2, since cars identical, so also dangerous only at δ=3.\n\nFreeway 4: one car, but freeway 4 and 5 have cars? Freeway 4: (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nLeft-moving, head=h=-60, tail=τ=-25, s=36\n\nSpan at δ: [h - s δ, τ - s δ] = [-60 -36δ, -25 -36δ]\n\n0 in this iff -60 -36δ ≤ 0 ≤ -25 -36δ\n\nNow, -60 -36δ ≤ 0 ⇒ -36δ ≤ 60 ⇒ multiply by -1, reverse inequality: 36δ ≥ -60, which is always true since δ≥0.\n\n0 ≤ -25 -36δ ⇒ 0 ≤ - (25 + 36δ) ⇒ which is never true because 25+36δ >0.\n\nSo 0 ≤ -25 -36δ is false for all δ, since right side negative.\n\nThus, never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same car, identical, so also never dangerous.\n\nFreeway 6: (-6,-17,right,6) head=-6, tail=-17? τ=tail=-17, h=head=-6, s=6\n\nRight-moving, span: [τ + s δ, h + s δ] = [-17 +6δ, -6 +6δ]\n\n0 in this iff -17 +6δ ≤ 0 ≤ -6 +6δ\n\nWhich is:\n\n-17 +6δ ≤ 0 ⇒ 6δ ≤ 17 ⇒ δ ≤ 17/6 ≈ 2.833, so δ ≤ 2 since integer? δ ≤ floor(17/6)=2? 17/6=2.833, δ≤2.833, so δ≤2 for integer.\n\nBut also 0 ≤ -6 +6δ ⇒ 6δ ≥ 6 ⇒ δ ≥1\n\nSo δ ≥1 and δ ≤ 2.833, so δ=1 or 2.\n\nCheck:\n\nδ=1: span [-17+6, -6+6] = [-11, 0], 0 included.\n\nδ=2: span [-17+12, -6+12] = [-5, 6], min=-5<0<6, 0 included.\n\nδ=3: span [-17+18, -6+18] = [1,12], min=1>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo at δ=1 and 2, covers 0.\n\nThus freeway 6 dangerous at δ=1,2.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,4) τ=-47, h=-36, s=4, right-moving.\n\nSpan: [τ + s δ, h + s δ] = [-47 +4δ, -36 +4δ]\n\n0 in this iff -47 +4δ ≤ 0 ≤ -36 +4δ\n\nSo -47 +4δ ≤ 0 ⇒ 4δ ≤ 47 ⇒ δ ≤ 47/4 = 11.75, δ ≤ 11\n\n0 ≤ -36 +4δ ⇒ 4δ ≥ 36 ⇒ δ ≥ 9\n\nSo δ ≥9 and δ ≤11.75, so δ=9,10,11\n\nCheck:\n\nδ=9: span [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0], 0 in\n\nδ=10: [-47+40, -36+40] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nδ=11: [-47+44, -36+44] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nδ=12: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSecond car: (28,17,right,4) head=28, tail=17, s=4\n\nτ=17, h=28, span [17+4δ, 28+4δ]\n\n0 in this? 17+4δ ≤0? 17+4δ ≥17>0, so min>0, never ≤0, so 0 never in span.\n\nThus, for freeway 7, dangerous when first car covers, at δ=9,10,11.\n\nFreeway 8: (-27,-38,right,3) head=-27, tail=-38, so τ=-38, h=-27, s=3, right-moving.\n\nSpan: [-38 +3δ, -27 +3δ]\n\n0 in this iff -38 +3δ ≤ 0 ≤ -27 +3δ\n\nSo -38 +3δ ≤0 ⇒ 3δ ≤38 ⇒ δ ≤ 38/3 ≈12.666, δ≤12\n\n0 ≤ -27 +3δ ⇒ 3δ ≥27 ⇒ δ ≥9\n\nSo δ ≥9 and δ ≤12.666, so δ=9,10,11,12\n\nCheck:\n\nδ=9: [-38+27, -27+27] = [-11, 0], 0 in\n\nδ=10: [-38+30, -27+30] = [-8,3], 0 in\n\nδ=11: [-38+33, -27+33] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nδ=12: [-38+36, -27+36] = [-2,9], 0 in\n\nδ=13: [-38+39, -27+39] = [1,12], min=1>0, not\n\nSo dangerous at δ=9,10,11,12.\n\nNow, summarize dangerous times per freeway:\n\ny=1: always safe (no car or car not covering 0)\n\ny=1 has a car but never covers 0, so safe.\n\ny=2: dangerous at δ=3\n\ny=3: dangerous at δ=3\n\ny=4: always safe\n\ny=5: always safe\n\ny=6: dangerous at δ=1,2\n\ny=7: dangerous at δ=9,10,11\n\ny=8: dangerous at δ=9,10,11,12\n\ny=9: no cars, I assume, since freeways y=1 to 8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 no cars? But player can be there, and no cars, so always safe.\n\ny=0 might have cars? But in this case, no cars listed for y=0 or y=9, so safe.\n\nBut player starts at y=2, needs to go to y=9.\n\nNow, the path: I start at δ=0, y=2.\n\nAt δ=0, y=2, is it dangerous? Freeway y=2 dangerous only at δ=3, not at δ=0, so safe to be there.\n\nSimilarly, I need to move to y=9.\n\nMinimal steps: from y=2 to y=9, need at least 7 steps if I go up each time, but I might need to wait or detour.\n\nWith actions, each U increases y by 1, so to go from 2 to 9, I need at least 7 U actions, and possibly some S or D, but S or D would increase time, so minimal H might be 7 if I can go straight up without collision.\n\nBut I need to check at each step if I would be on a dangerous freeway at that time.\n\nSo let's consider going straight up: actions all U, so at time δ, y = 2 + δ, for δ=0 to 6, y from 2 to 8, then at δ=7, y=9.\n\ny_δ = 2 + δ for δ=0 to 6, then at δ=7, y=9 if I go up each step.\n\nSequence: at δ=0, y=2\n\nδ=1, y=3\n\nδ=2, y=4\n\nδ=3, y=5\n\nδ=4, y=6\n\nδ=5, y=7\n\nδ=6, y=8\n\nδ=7, y=9\n\nNow, check for each δ, y_δ, and if it is dangerous.\n\nδ=0: y=2, freeway 2 dangerous at δ=3, not 0, so safe.\n\nδ=1: y=3, freeway 3 dangerous at δ=3, not 1, so safe? At δ=1, y=3.\n\nFreeway 3 dangerous only at δ=3, so at δ=1, not dangerous, safe.\n\nδ=2: y=4, freeway 4 always safe, so ok.\n\nδ=3: y=5, freeway 5 always safe, ok.\n\nδ=4: y=6, freeway 6 dangerous at δ=1,2, not 4, so safe.\n\nδ=5: y=7, freeway 7 dangerous at δ=9,10,11, not 5, so safe.\n\nδ=6: y=8, freeway 8 dangerous at δ=9,10,11,12, not 6, so safe.\n\nδ=7: y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nSo all safe! I can go directly up in 7 steps.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAt δ=3, I am at y=5, which is freeway 5, always safe.\n\nAnd at the times when y=2 or y=3 are dangerous, I am not there.\n\ny=2 dangerous only at δ=3, but at δ=3, I am at y=5, not y=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 dangerous at δ=3, but I am at y=5 then.\n\ny=6 dangerous at δ=1,2; at δ=1, I am at y=3, not y=6; δ=2, I am at y=4, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and y=8 dangerous later, but I pass through earlier.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at δ=3, y=5, safe.\n\nAnd I reach y=9 at δ=7.\n\nNow, actions: from δ=0 to δ=6, I do U each time? Let's see the actions.\n\nThe sequence is for turns t₁ + t, where t from 0 to H-1.\n\nSet τ = t, from 0 to H-1.\n\nAt time τ relative, position after action.\n\nStart at τ=0, position (0,2), before action? No.\n\nGame dynamics: at turn t, player position is given, then action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nAnd Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, player is at y_t, performs action a_t, then moves to y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T: if at turn T, player is on y_T, and for that freeway, 0 in Span(T) for some car.\n\nIn the collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's position at turn T.\n\nAlso, note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut in this case, for collision, it only cares about the current position at turn T.\n\nSo at each turn T, based on y_T, check if freeway y_T has a car covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nIn my path above:\n\nAt turn relative τ:\n\nτ=0: position y=2, freeway y=2. Dangerous at τ=3? But τ=0, so not τ=3, so safe.\n\nτ=1: after action, y=3 (since I did U at τ=0, so y_{1} = y_0 +1 =3)\n\nAt τ=1, position y=3, freeway 3. Dangerous at τ=3, not τ=1, safe.\n\nτ=2: y=4, freeway 4, always safe.\n\nτ=3: y=5, freeway 5, always safe.\n\nτ=4: y=6, freeway 6. Dangerous at τ=1,2. τ=4 not in {1,2}, safe.\n\nτ=5: y=7, freeway 7. Dangerous at τ=9,10,11, τ=5 not in, safe.\n\nτ=6: y=8, freeway 8. Dangerous at τ=9-12, τ=6 not in, safe.\n\nτ=7: y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nI reach y=9 at τ=7, so after 7 actions? H is the number of turns, so from τ=0 to τ=6, I do actions, and at τ=7, I am at y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from t₁ to t₁ + H - 1, and at turn t₁ + H - 1, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn this case, at turn t₁ + 7, position is (0,9), so H-1 =7, so H=8 turns? Let's see.\n\nDefine:\n\nTurn index: let the actions be at turns t for t = t₁, t₁+1, ..., up to t₁ + H - 1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have H+1 positions? No.\n\nAt turn t, position is y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThe sequence: at time t, we are at position y_t, perform a_t, then move to y_{t+1}.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn t based on y_t.\n\nWe start at turn t₁, position (0, y_{t₁}) = (0,2)\n\nWe need to reach a state where at some turn, position is (0,9).\n\nThat turn is when we achieve y=9.\n\nSuppose at turn T, y_T = 9.\n\nT = t₁ + K for some K.\n\nThen, the actions are from turn t₁ to turn T-1, since at turn T-1, we perform action to set y_T.\n\ny_T depends on action at T-1.\n\nThe minimal H is the number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nIn the task: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nSo at turn t₁ + H - 1, position is (0,9).\n\nThat means after H-1 actions, we are at y=9.\n\nStart at turn t₁, position y_{t₁} = 2.\n\nAfter action a_{t₁}, we go to y_{t₁ +1}, and so on, up to after action a_{t₁ + H - 2}, we go to y_{t₁ + H - 1} =9.\n\ny_{t₁ + H - 1} is set by action at t₁ + H - 2.\n\nBut at turn t₁ + H - 1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn terms of the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1 relative, meaning a_{t₁} to a_{t₁ + H - 1}.\n\nSet relative time τ, from 0 to H-1.\n\nAt τ=0, turn t₁, position y=2.\n\nAction a_{t₁} determines y_{τ=1} = y_{t₁+1}\n\n...\n\nAt τ=k, position y_{t₁ + k}\n\nAction a_{t₁ + k} determines y_{t₁ + k +1}\n\nWe want at some τ = M, y_{t₁ + M} =9.\n\nThen H-1 = M, so y_{t₁ + H -1} =9.\n\nThe actions are for t=0 to H-1, meaning from turn t₁ to t₁ + H -1.\n\nAnd after H actions? Number of actions is H.\n\nFrom τ=0 to τ=H-1, there are H actions.\n\nAfter action at τ=H-1, we have y_{t₁ + H} = y_{t₁ + (H-1) +1} = y_{t₁ + H}, but we want y_{t₁ + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t₁ + H -1} is the position at turn t₁ + H -1.\n\nTo have y_{t₁ + H -1} =9, it must be set by the action at turn t₁ + H -2.\n\nFor example, if I do nothing, at τ=0, y=2.\n\nAfter 0 actions, I am still at y=2, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to change y.\n\nMinimal way: from y=2 to y=9, I need at least 7 up actions.\n\nEach up action increases y by 1, so after 7 up actions, I go from y=2 to y=9.\n\nThe turn when I reach y=9: start at turn T_start = t₁, y=2.\n\nAfter first U at T_start, y=3 at turn T_start +1\n\nAfter second U at T_start+1, y=4 at turn T_start+2\n\n...\n\nAfter k-th U, y=2+k at turn T_start + k\n\nSet y=9 when 2+k=9, k=7.\n\nSo after 7th U, at turn T_start +7, y=9.\n\nNow, the actions: I perform actions at turns T_start to T_start+6, all U.\n\nThen at turn T_start+7, position is y=9.\n\nIn this case, the sequence of actions is from turn t₁ to t₁+6, 7 actions.\n\nH is the number of turns, meaning the actions from t=0 to H-1 relative, and at turn t₁ + H -1, position is 9.\n\nHere, after 7 actions, at turn t₁ +7, position is 9.\n\nSo t₁ + H -1 = t₁ +7, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nActions from t=0 to 7? t from 0 to H-1=7, so 8 actions? No.\n\nH-1=7, so actions from τ=0 to τ=6, since τ=0 to H-2? Let's clarify.\n\nStandard: let the actions be indexed from 0 to H-1.\n\nAfter action at τ=k, we have position at τ=k+1.\n\nAt τ=0 (turn t₁), position y_0 =2\n\nAction a_0\n\nThen position y_1 at turn t₁+1\n\nAction a_1\n\n...\n\nAction a_{H-1} at turn t₁ + H -1\n\nThen position y_H at turn t₁ + H\n\nBut we want position at turn t₁ + H -1 to be 9, which is y_{H-1}? Notation.\n\nSet the position at time τ relative: let y(τ) be position at turn t₁ + τ.\n\nSo at τ=0, y(0) =2\n\nAfter action a(τ) at turn t₁+τ, y(τ+1) = y(τ) + Δy based on a(τ)\n\nWe want y(K) =9 for some K.\n\nThen H-1 = K, so that at turn t₁ + H -1, y(H-1) =9.\n\nThe actions are a(τ) for τ=0 to H-2, which set y(1) to y(H-1).\n\ny(H-1) is set by a(H-2).\n\nBut at turn t₁ + H -1, position is y(H-1).\n\nTo have y(H-1)=9, and y(0)=2.\n\nThe number of actions to go from y(0) to y(H-1) is H-1 actions? From τ=0 to τ=H-1, there are H positions: y(0) to y(H-1).\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=H-2 affect the transitions.\n\nFor example, minimal: from y=2 to y=9, need 7 steps up.\n\nSo y(0)=2\n\nAfter a(0)=U, y(1)=3\n\n...\n\nAfter a(6)=U, y(7)=9\n\nSo at τ=7, y(7)=9.\n\nThus, H-1=7, so H=8.\n\nThe turn when position is 9 is τ=7, which is t₁ +7.\n\nActions at τ=0 to τ=6, all U.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from τ=0 to H-1=7?

No.\n\na(τ) for τ=0 to H-1, but H-1 is the index for action.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1}, meaning a(t₁ + t) for t=0,1,2,...,H-1.\n\nAnd after these actions, at turn t₁ + H, position? But we want at turn t₁ + H -1 position is 9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nRead the task:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n\"such that y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nSo the actions are performed at turns t₁, t₁+1, ..., t₁ + H -1.\n\nAfter action at turn t, we have position at turn t+1.\n\nSo after action at t₁ + H -1, we have position at turn t₁ + H.\n\nBut we want position at turn t₁ + H -1 to be 9.\n\nPosition at turn t₁ + H -1 is set by the action at turn t₁ + H -2.\n\nFor example, at turn t₁, position is given as y=2.\n\nThen action at t₁ sets y at t₁+1.\n\nAction at t₁+1 sets y at t₁+2, and so on.\n\nTo have position at turn t₁ + K be 9, it is set by action at turn t₁ + K -1.\n\nThe last action to reach y=9 is at some turn.\n\nIn this case, to have y at turn T be 9, T = t₁ + M.\n\nThen the actions from t₁ to T-1 are performed.\n\nThe number of actions is M.\n\nThen at turn T, y=9.\n\nIn the notation, T = t₁ + H -1, so H-1 = M, thus number of actions H.\n\nFor example, start at t₁, position y=2.\n\nIf I do nothing, S, at turn t₁, position y=2, not 9.\n\nI need to perform actions to change position.\n\nAfter first action at t₁, position at t₁+1 could be 1,2,3.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to increase y.\n\nMinimal: after 7 U actions, at turn t₁+7, y=9.\n\nThe actions are at turns t₁ to t₁+6, all U.\n\nThen at turn t₁+7, y=9.\n\nNow, turn t₁ + H -1 = t₁+7, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1=7, so a_{t₁+0} to a_{t₁+7}, but that would be 8 actions, from t₁ to t₁+7.\n\nBut I only need actions up to t₁+6.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, H=8, t=0 to 7, actions at t₁ to t₁+7.\n\nBut at t₁+7, if I perform action, it sets y at t₁+8, which is after.\n\nI think I confused the indexing.\n\nStandard way in the problem:\n\n- At turn t, position y_t\n\n- Action a_t determines y_{t+1}\n\n- We start at t=t₁, y_{t₁} given\n\n- We want y_{t₁ + H -1} = 9\n\n- Actions a_t for t = t₁ to t₁ + H -2? Let's see the range.\n\ny_{t₁ + H -1} is set by a_{t₁ + H -2}\n\nThe actions are from t=t₁ to t₁ + H -2 for the transitions.\n\nBut the sequence is given as {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, which would be a_{t₁} to a_{t₁ + H -1}, H actions.\n\nThen y_{t+1} for t from t₁ to t₁ + H -1, so positions from y_{t₁+1} to y_{t₁ + H}\n\nBut we want y_{t₁ + H -1} =9, which is not necessarily in the positions set directly.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions {a_{t₁}}, then y_{t₁+1} = y_{t₁} + Δy, but we want y_{t₁} =9 if H-1=0, but y_{t₁}=2, not 9.\n\nIf H=2, actions a_{t₁} and a_{t₁+1}, then y_{t₁+1} and y_{t₁+2}, we want y_{t₁+1} =9.\n\ny_{t₁+1} is set by a_{t₁}, y_{t₁+2} set by a_{t₁+1}.\n\nIn general, for y_{t₁ + H -1} to be 9, it is set by action a_{t₁ + H -2}.\n\nThe actions include a_{t₁ + H -1}, which sets y_{t₁ + H}, which may not be used.\n\nBut in the sequence, it must be included, I think.\n\nTo minimize H, we can have the last action setting y=9.\n\nIn this case, for going straight up: actions at t₁ to t₁+6: all U, then at turn t₁+7, y=9.\n\nSo y_{t₁+7} =9.\n\nThus t₁ + H -1 = t₁+7, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1=7, so a_{t₁+0} to a_{t₁+7}, that's 8 actions.\n\nBut I only need 7 actions: a_{t₁} to a_{t₁+6}.\n\nWith a_{t₁} to a_{t₁+6}, all U, then y_{t₁+7} =9.\n\nFor the sequence, {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, with H=8, t from 0 to 7, actions at t₁ to t₁+7.\n\nBut a_{t₁+7} would set y_{t₁+8}, which is not needed.\n\nPerhaps for H=8, we have actions up to a_{t₁+7}, but we can set a_{t₁+7} to S or something, but y_{t₁+7} is already 9 if we stopped.\n\nThe minimal H is when we reach at turn t₁ + K with y=9, then H-1 = K, so K = H-1.\n\nNumber of actions to reach is K, from t₁ to t₁+K-1 actions, position at t₁+K.\n\nSet t₁+K = t₁ + H -1, so K = H-1.\n\nNumber of actions is K = H-1.\n\nIn the action sequence, for H turns, there are H actions, but the first H-1 actions set the position up to y_{t₁ + H -1}, and the last action is at turn t₁ + H -1, which sets y_{t₁ + H}, but since we only care about position at t₁ + H -1, we can choose the last action arbitrarily, but it might affect if we stay or move, but since we are at 9, we can stay.\n\nIn this case, for our path, with 7 actions U from t₁ to t₁+6, position at t₁+7 is 9.\n\nSo to have y_{t₁ + H -1} =9, set t₁ + H -1 = t₁+7, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to 7: a_{t₁} to a_{t₁+7}.\n\nFor t=0 to 6, a_{t₁+t} = U for t=0,1,2,3,4,5,6\n\nThen for t=7, a_{t₁+7}, we can set it to S, since we are already at y=9 at turn t₁+7, but the position at turn t₁+7 is set by action at t₁+6, so at turn t₁+7, y=9.\n\nAction at t₁+7 sets y at t₁+8, which we don't care, so we can set a_{t₁+7} to S, for example.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence, we need to specify all actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nBut for reaching, the first 7 actions are U, and the last one can be S.\n\nNow, back to the collision: in my earlier check, with all U, at each turn, the position is safe.\n\nAt turn t₁ + τ for τ=0 to 6: positions y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n\nAt τ=7, y=9.\n\nAnd as per times, no collision.\n\nBut at which turns? Let's list the absolute turn or relative.\n\nAt relative turn τ from start:\n\nTurn at time: let the turn number be t₁ + τ for τ >=0.\n\nAt turn T = t₁ + τ, position y_T.\n\nFor collision at turn T, depends on y_T and τ.\n\nSince T - t₁ = τ.\n\nIn the path:\n\nAt T = t₁ + 0: y=2, τ=0, freeway 2, dangerous at τ=3, not 0, safe.\n\nT = t₁ +1: y=3, τ=1, freeway 3, dangerous at τ=3, not 1, safe.\n\nT = t₁ +2: y=4, τ=2, freeway 4, safe.\n\nT = t₁ +3: y=5, τ=3, freeway 5, safe.\n\nT = t₁ +4: y=6, τ=4, freeway 6, dangerous at τ=1,2, not 4, safe.\n\nT = t₁ +5: y=7, τ=5, freeway 7, dangerous at τ=9,10,11, not 5, safe.\n\nT = t₁ +6: y=8, τ=6, freeway 8, dangerous at τ=9-12, not 6, safe.\n\nT = t₁ +7: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut in the sequence for H=8, we have actions from τ=0 to 7 relative to t₁.\n\nActions:\n\nAt turn t₁ + t for t=0 to 7.\n\nFor t=0 to 6: a_{t₁+t} = U\n\nThen at t=7, a_{t₁+7}, since y at t₁+7 is 9, and we can stay, so a_{t₁+7} = S\n\nBut the position at turn t₁+7 is already 9, set by previous action.\n\nAction at t₁+7 sets y at t₁+8, but we don't care.\n\nIn the output, we need the sequence for the turns until we reach, but since H=8, we include 8 actions.\n\nTo be precise, with 7 actions U from t₁ to t₁+6, we reach at t₁+7.\n\nBut for H=8, we have an extra action.\n\nPerhaps minimal H is 8 with 7 U and one S at the end, but H is the number of turns, which includes the actions.\n\nSince we can reach in 7 steps, but with H=8 turns.\n\nAnother way: if I start at t₁, y=2, and I do S at t₁, then I stay at y=2 at t₁+1, but I need to move, so it takes more time.\n\nMinimal H should be 8 for reaching at t₁+7.\n\nIn the sequence, for t=0 to 6: U, t=7: S.\n\nBut let's confirm if at any point I might be at wrong place.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 6, dangerous at τ=1,2, but at τ=1, I am at y=3, not y=6, so ok.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 2 and 3 are dangerous at τ=3, but at τ=3, I am at y=5, not y=2 or 3.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be the minimal H.\n\nIs there a shorter path? For example, if I go up faster, but I can only change by 1 each turn, so 7 steps is minimum.\n\nIf I go down, it would take more turns.\n\nSo H=8 should be minimal.\n\nBut let me check if at τ=0, if I can do something, but I need to go up.\n\nPerhaps I can go up but avoid certain times, but in this case, no need.\n\nAnother thing: at τ=1, y=3, which is freeway 3, and at τ=1, is it safe? Yes, only dangerous at τ=3.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut freeway 3 has cars, but at τ=1, no car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should list the danger times again.\n\nFreeway 2: dangerous only at τ=3\n\nFreeway 3: dangerous only at τ=3\n\nFreeway 6: dangerous at τ=1,2\n\nFreeway 7: τ=9,10,11\n\nFreeway 8: τ=9,10,11,12\n\nIn my path:\n\nAt τ=0, y=2, safe\n\nτ=1, y=3, safe\n\nτ=2, y=4, safe\n\nτ=3, y=5, safe\n\nτ=4, y=6, safe (since dangerous at 1,2)\n\nτ=5, y=7, safe\n\nτ=6, y=8, safe\n\nτ=7, y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nNow for H=8, actions:\n\nTurn t₁: a_{t₁} = U  // to go to y=3\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t, action a_t.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t₁: a_{t₁} = U  // after this, at t₁+1, y=3\n\nTurn t₁+1: a_{t₁+1} = U  // to y=4\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t₁+6: a_{t₁+6} = U  // to y=9 at t₁+7\n\nThen for turn t₁+7: we need to specify a_{t₁+7}, which can be S, since we are at y=9.\n\nIn the position at t₁+7, y=9, which is what we want.\n\nAnd action at t₁+7 is not necessary, but for the sequence up to H-1=7, since H=8, t from 0 to 7.\n\nt from 0 to H-1=7, so actions at t₁ to t₁+7.\n\na_{t₁+7} can be S.\n\nTo output:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 + 6: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 7: S\n\nBut in the box, since t_1 is given as 86.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be with the turn numbers.\n\nBut since t_1 is given, we can write.\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 7 and 8 have dangers later, but not relevant.\n\nBut is there a problem at y=6? Freeway 6 dangerous at τ=1,2, but I am there at τ=4, which is safe.\n\nBut let me confirm the cars on freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6: car at (-6,-17,right,6), at τ=4, span: [-17 +6*4, -6 +6*4] = [-17+24, -6+24] = [7,18], min=7>0, so x=0 not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=1, [-17+6, -6+6] = [-11,0], covers 0.\n\nτ=2, [-17+12, -6+12] = [-5,6], covers 0.\n\nτ=3, [-17+18, -6+18] = [1,12], not.\n\nSo all fine.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways when I am there.\n\nSo the sequence should work.\n\nBut the minimal H is 8.\n\nBut is there a shorter way? For example, if I go up faster, but I can't, since max +1 per turn.\n\nOr if I start by going down, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo H=8 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier, but from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps, so at least turn t₁+7.\n\nThus H=8.\n\nNow, for the sequence, actions from t₁ to t₁+6: U, and at t₁+7: S, but since we need to output up to t₁ + H-1 = t₁+7.\n\nIn the action at t₁+7, I set S, but it doesn't affect the position at t₁+7.\n\nTo save, I could have H=7, but if H=7, then y_{t₁ + 7 -1} = y_{t₁+6} should be 9.\n\nBut at t₁+6, in my path, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y_{t₁+6} =9, I need to reach faster.\n\nBut from y=2 to y=9 in 6 steps? Only if I increase by more than 1 per turn, but I can't, max +1.\n\nSo impossible to reach before t₁+7.\n\nThus minimal H=8.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U  // since t₁=86, t₁+1=87\n\n...\n\nList:\n\nt₁ =86\n\nAction at turn 86: U → position at 87: y=3\n\nAction at turn 87: U → position at 88: y=4\n\nAction at turn 88: U → position at 89: y=5\n\nAction at turn 89: U → position at 90: y=6\n\nAction at turn 90: U → position at 91: y=7\n\nAction at turn 91: U → position at 92: y=8\n\nAction at turn 92: U → position at 93: y=9\n\nNow, at turn 93, y=9, which is t₁+7.\n\nFor H=8, y_{t₁ + H -1} = y_{86+7} = y_{93} =9, good.\n\nActions: from turn 86 to turn 92, that's 7 actions: indices t=86 to 92.\n\nBut for the sequence {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, H=8, t=0 to 7.\n\nt=0: a_{86} = U\n\nt=1: a_{87} = U\n\nt=2: a_{88} = U\n\nt=3: a_{89} = U\n\nt=4: a_{90} = U\n\nt=5: a_{91} = U\n\nt=6: a_{92} = U\n\nNow t=7: a_{93} = ? Since at turn 93, position is already y=9, we can set a_{93} = S\n\nThen position at turn 94: y=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the output, it should be fine.\n\nTo avoid extra action, but we have to include for H=8.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 93, we output action.\n\nBut in the position at turn 93 is 9, set by action at 92.\n\nAction at 93 is additional.\n\nBut in the task, it says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"y_{t₁ + H -1} =9\", so with H=8, t from 0 to 7, actions at t₁ to t₁+7, and position at t₁+7=93 is 9.\n\nAction at t₁+7=93 sets y at 94, but position at 93 is given as 9.\n\nSo it's consistent.\n\nIn the sequence, a_{93} can be S.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut in the box, we need to write the actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is any issue at the beginning.\n\nAt turn 86, y=2, action U.\n\nIs there a car at y=2 at τ=0? Freeway 2, at τ=0, span? For freeway 2, cars: first car [1,12] at τ=0, min=1>0, not cover 0. Second car [-47,-36], min=-47<0, max=-36<0, so 0 not in, since both negative. So safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 2 has two cars, but at τ=0, both not at 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I do.\n\nBut let me see if I can do with less, but no.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at some point to avoid, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: at τ=3, freeway 2 and 3 are dangerous, but I am at y=5, safe.\n\nBut what if I was at y=2 or 3 at τ=3, I would collide, but I am not.\n\nSo all good.\n\nThus minimal H=8, sequence: U for turns 86 to 92, and S for turn 93? Turns: actions at 86,87,88,89,90,91,92: U, and at 93: S.\n\nIn the sequence for t=0 to 7 relative:\n\nt=0: turn 86: U\n\nt=1: turn 87: U\n\nt=2: turn 88: U\n\nt=3: turn 89: U\n\nt=4: turn 90: U\n\nt=5: turn 91: U\n\nt=6: turn 92: U\n\nt=7: turn 93: S\n\nIn the output format:\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nTurn 93: S\n\nBut position at turn 93 is 9, achieved.\n\nSince the last action is S, but it doesn't change, but it's fine.\n\nTo make it cleaner, but I think it's acceptable.\n\nPerhaps I can have only 7 actions, but with H=7, then y_{t₁ +6} should be 9, but from y=2, in 6 actions, I can reach y=8 max, since 2+6=8, not 9. So impossible.\n\nThus H=8 is minimal.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n\nBut in the initial, the player is at (0,2), and I go directly up.\n\nBut let me see the cars on freeway 6, at τ=4, I am there, but safe.\n\nPerhaps I should list the answer.\n\nBut in the output, it should be in a box.\n\nBut t_1=86, so:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 86: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 89: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 90: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 91: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 92: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 93: S \\end{array} }\n\nBut for turn 93, action S, but position is already 9.\n\nTo be precise, I could do U at turn 93, but y would go to 10, but y max is 9, so if I do U at y=9, y_{t+1} = min(9+1,9)=9, so same as S.\n\nBut S is fine.\n\nIn some definitions, U might not change, but here y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, with clamping, I assume.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so at y=9, U or S both give y=9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo S is fine.\n\nPerhaps I can have no action at turn 93, but I have to include for the sequence.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 7 and 8, but I am there at τ=5 and 6, which is before danger times.\n\nτ=5 at y=7, freeway 7 dangerous at τ=9,10,11, so τ=5 safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 86\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the sequence of actions must be planned considering the car movements and collision conditions.\n\n### Analysis of Car Hazards\nThe dangerous times (relative to \\(t_1\\)) for each freeway, when a car covers \\(x = 0\\), are:\n- Freeway 1: Always safe (no car covers \\(x = 0\\)).\n- Freeway 2: Dangerous only at \\(\\delta = 3\\).\n- Freeway 3: Dangerous only at \\(\\delta = 3\\).\n- Freeway 4: Always safe.\n- Freeway 5: Always safe.\n- Freeway 6: Dangerous at \\(\\delta = 1, 2\\).\n- Freeway 7: Dangerous at \\(\\delta = 9, 10, 11\\).\n- Freeway 8: Dangerous at \\(\\delta = 9, 10, 11, 12\\).\n- Freeway 9: Always safe (no cars).\n\n### Path to (0, 9) with Minimal Turns\nThe player starts at \\(y = 2\\) and needs to reach \\(y = 9\\).

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 87, and the player is at (0,3). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer movement: \n  U: y increases by 1 (unless at 9, then stays)\n  D: y decreases by 1 (unless at 0, then stays)\n  S: stay at same y.\n\nCollision: At turn T, if the player is at (0, y) and y is a freeway (1 to 8), then we check the car(s) on that freeway at turn T.\n  - The car's position at turn T is computed by moving from the initial state at turn t1 (87) by (T - 87) turns.\n\nImportant: The player is on a freeway y at turn T if at the end of turn T (after moving) the y-coordinate is y. \n  - Note: If the player moves from y to y' at turn T, then at turn T the player is on y (before moving) and then moves to y' (which is the position at turn T+1). \n  - Therefore, at turn T, the player is on the freeway y_T (the starting y at that turn). The collision check for turn T is done for the freeway y_T.\n\nHowever, note the clarification: \n  \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd: \n  \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_{T} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nSo, at turn T, the player is considered to be on the row y_T (the row at the start of the turn) for the entire turn. \nWhen we move, we are on the new row at the next turn.\n\nThus, the sequence:\n  Turn T: start at y_T, choose action a_T -> then we are at y_{T+1} = y_T + delta.\n  At turn T, we check the cars on row y_T (the row we started on) at time T.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway row (1-8) at a turn T when there is a car on that row at time T that covers x=0.\n\nNote: The cars move continuously. The car's position at time T (relative to t1=87) is computed by:\n\n  For a car given at t1 (turn 87) with (head, tail, direction, speed):\n    Let dt = T - 87.\n    For left-moving (d = left): \n        head(T) = head(87) - s * dt\n        tail(T) = tail(87) - s * dt\n        The span is [min(head(T), tail(T)), max(head(T), tail(T))]? \n\nBut note the representation:\n  - Left-moving: originally at t1: [h, τ] meaning from h (head) to τ (tail) and since it's left-moving, the head is at the right? \n    Actually, the update rule says:\n      Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n    But note: for a left-moving car, the head is the rightmost part? Because as it moves left, the head (which was at h) moves to h - s*(dt). \n    However, the span is given as [h, τ] at t1 and then [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt] at T. This implies that at t1, the car occupies from τ to h (if τ < h) or h to τ? \n\nBut observe the example representation in the input:\n  For freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48) -> for a right-moving car, the head is at -48 and tail at -95? \n  But note: for right-moving, the update is: [τ, h] -> [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt]. \n\nActually, the representation for right-moving is given as (head, tail, direction, speed) and the update rule for right-moving uses the tail first? \n\nLet me clarify the update:\n\n  For a right-moving car: \n      At t1, the car's head is at h, and tail at τ? \n      But the update rule says: \n          Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> becomes [τ + s*(dt), h + s*(dt)]\n\n  So in the input, the car on freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48) \n      So at t1, the car spans from τ = -95 to h = -48? \n\n  Similarly, for left-moving: \n      Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt]\n\n  In the input, freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36) -> at t1, the car spans from h=48 to τ=83? But that would be increasing? \n\nWait, this seems inconsistent. Let's check the update:\n\n  For left-moving: the car moves left, so the head (front) should be the leftmost? Or the rightmost?\n\nBut note the update: \n  Left-moving: [h, τ] at t1 -> [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt] at T.\n\nIf at t1 the car is from 48 to 83 (so from 48 to 83 is a length of 35, and moving left), then at T, the entire segment shifts left by s*dt.\n\nBut 48 to 83 is from 48 (left) to 83 (right) -> so the head (front) is at 83? But then why is it called head? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might define the head as the leading part in the direction of motion. So for left-moving, the head is the leftmost part? \n\nBut note the update: \n  Left: [h, τ] -> [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt]\n\nIf the car is moving left, then the head (the front) should be the leftmost part. Then at t1, the head is at h and the tail at τ, and we require h < τ? \n\nBut in freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36) -> so h=48, τ=83. Then the car spans from 48 to 83? Then as it moves left, the head (48) moves to 48 - s*dt, and the tail (83) moves to 83 - s*dt. \n\nBut that would mean the car is getting longer? Because 48-83 is 35 units, and then at a later time, the tail (originally at 83) moves left as well? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the representation is [head, tail] and the car extends from min(head, tail) to max(head, tail). \n\nBut note the update: \n  For left: [h, τ] -> [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt] -> so the new span is [min(h - s*dt, τ - s*dt), max(h - s*dt, τ - s*dt)]?\n\nBut then the car's length is |h - τ|, which is fixed.\n\nSimilarly for right: [τ, h] -> [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt] -> so the car spans from τ + s*dt to h + s*dt (if τ < h) or the other way? \n\nIn the input, for freeway 2: (24, 13, right, 12) -> so τ=24? h=13? But then [τ, h] = [24,13] -> which is from 13 to 24? \n\nBut the update rule says for right: [τ, h] -> [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt]. So at t1, the car spans from 13 to 24? \n\nBut wait: the problem says for right: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then becomes [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt]. \n\nBut if at t1 we have [τ, h] = [24, 13], then that would be an interval that goes from 13 to 24? Because the interval is defined by the two endpoints? \n\nSo I think we should interpret the car's span as the interval between the two numbers, regardless of order? \n\nBut note: the update rule for right-moving uses [τ, h] and then shifts both by s*dt to the right. So the car's position at time T is the interval [min(τ + s*dt, h + s*dt), max(τ + s*dt, h + s*dt)]? \n\nHowever, the problem states the update as:\n  Right: [τ, h] -> [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt]\n\nBut then the span at T is [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt]? \n\nBut if τ > h, then the interval [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt] would be [larger, smaller]? \n\nTo avoid confusion, we should note that the car occupies a contiguous set of x-coordinates. The collision condition is that the player is at x=0 and at time T, 0 is in the span of the car on the freeway y_T.\n\nSo for a car, we can compute:\n  Let dt = T - 87.\n  For a right-moving car: \n      x1 = τ + s * dt\n      x2 = h + s * dt\n      The car occupies [min(x1, x2), max(x1, x2)].\n\n  For a left-moving car:\n      x1 = h - s * dt\n      x2 = τ - s * dt\n      The car occupies [min(x1, x2), max(x1, x2)].\n\nBut note: in the input, for a right-moving car, the first number is called \"head\" and the second \"tail\"? \n  Actually, the input says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nSo for right-moving: head = h, tail = τ -> and then the update uses [τ, h] for right? \n\nWait, the update rule says for right: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" -> so the tail is first? \n\nThis is confusing. Let me re-read the problem:\n\n  For car k on freeway i, at turn t1, we are given (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\n  Then for right-moving: \n        Span(t1) = [τ, h] \n        -> becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] at T.\n\n  For left-moving:\n        Span(t1) = [h, τ]\n        -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] at T.\n\nSo the representation at t1 is given as (h, τ) for both, but then the span is defined differently:\n\n  Right: [τ, h] at t1 -> meaning the car spans from τ to h? \n  Left: [h, τ] at t1 -> meaning the car spans from h to τ? \n\nBut note: for the right-moving car on freeway 1: (head=-48, tail=-95, right, 48) -> so τ = -95, h = -48.\n  Then at t1, the span is [τ, h] = [-95, -48] -> so the car occupies from -95 to -48? \n\nSimilarly, for the left-moving car on freeway 4: (head=48, tail=83, left, 36) -> then at t1, the span is [h, τ] = [48,83]? \n\nSo the car's span at t1 is the interval from the first component to the second component, and then we shift appropriately.\n\nTherefore, to compute the car's position at turn T (>=87):\n  dt = T - 87\n  For a right-moving car: \n        x_start = τ + s * dt\n        x_end = h + s * dt\n        The car covers [min(x_start, x_end), max(x_start, x_end)]? Actually, since τ and h are given and for right-moving we have τ and h, and the update adds the same amount, the order remains. \n        But note: in the example for freeway 2: (24,13,right,12) -> so τ=24, h=13 -> then at t1, the car covers [24,13] -> which is from 13 to 24? \n\nBut wait, [24,13] if we take as an interval would be [13,24] if we interpret as the set of x from 13 to 24? \n\nActually, the problem does not specify the order of the endpoints. We just have two endpoints. The car covers the entire segment between the two.\n\nSo the condition for collision is: 0 is between the two endpoints (inclusive) of the car's segment at time T.\n\nTherefore, for a car at time T:\n  Let endpoints = \n      if right: (τ + s*dt, h + s*dt)\n      if left: (h - s*dt, τ - s*dt)\n\n  Then the car covers [min(endpoint1, endpoint2), max(endpoint1, endpoint2)].\n\n  We check if 0 is in that interval.\n\nNow, the goal: we start at (0,3) at turn 87. We want to get to (0,9) as quickly as possible.\n\nWe can only change y by at most 1 per turn. So we need at least 6 moves upward (from 3 to 9: 3->4->5->6->7->8->9: 6 moves) if we go straight up. But we have to avoid collisions on rows 4,5,6,7,8 (since row 3: we are at turn 87, and then we move to row 4 at turn 88, etc.)\n\nBut note: we start at row 3 at turn 87. Since row 3 is not a freeway? Actually, the freeways are y=1 to 8. So row 3 is a freeway (y=3). \n\nThe freeways are y=1,2,...,8. So every row from 1 to 8 has cars. \n\nAt turn 87, we are at row 3. So we must check the cars on row 3 at turn 87? \n\nBut the car state is only given for freeways 1,2,...,8. And freeway 3 has two cars: (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12). \n\nSo we need to check if at turn 87, on row 3, is there a car that covers x=0?\n\nFor freeway 3 (row 3) at turn 87 (dt=0):\n  Car1: right-moving: τ=24, h=13, s=12 -> endpoints = 24 + 0 = 24, 13 + 0 = 13 -> interval [13,24]. 0 is not in [13,24].\n  Car2: right-moving: τ=-24, h=-35 -> endpoints = -24 + 0 = -24, -35 + 0 = -35 -> interval [-35,-24]. 0 is not in [-35,-24].\n\nSo at turn 87, we are safe at row 3.\n\nNow, we plan the next moves. We can choose U, D, or S.\n\nWe want to minimize the number of turns. The minimal moves would be 6 upward moves (without any down or stay) if we can avoid all collisions.\n\nBut we must check for each turn T (starting from 87) and for the row we are at at the start of the turn (which is y_T) whether the cars on that row at time T cover x=0.\n\nWe are going to simulate from turn 87 (current turn) until we reach row 9.\n\nWe are at:\n  T0: turn 87, y=3 -> safe (as above).\n\nWe then choose an action for turn 87. We want to go up, so let's try U.\n\nThen at turn 88: \n  We are at row 4 (because we moved up from 3 to 4 at the end of turn 87, so at the start of turn 88 we are at row 4).\n\nNow, at turn 88, we are on row 4 (freeway) and we must check the cars on row 4 at time 88.\n\nFreeway 4: only one car: (48,83,left,36) -> left-moving, so endpoints at time T (88) = \n  dt = 88-87 = 1\n  h - s*dt = 48 - 36*1 = 12\n  τ - s*dt = 83 - 36*1 = 47\n  So the car is from 12 to 47? -> interval [12,47]. 0 is not in [12,47] -> safe.\n\nThen we choose U again for turn 88: \n  Then at turn 89: we start at row 5.\n\nFreeway 5: same car as freeway 4? \n  The car on freeway 5: (48,83,left,36) -> same as freeway 4? \n  So at turn 89, dt=2:\n      endpoints: 48 - 36*2 = 48-72 = -24; 83-72=11 -> so the car is from -24 to 11? \n      Then the interval is [-24,11]. 0 is in [-24,11] -> collision! \n\nSo we cannot go to row 5 at turn 89? \n\nBut note: at turn 89, the player would be at row 5 at the start of the turn (because at the end of turn 88 we moved to 5). So we check row 5 at time 89.\n\nAnd indeed, the car on row 5 at time 89 covers 0.\n\nTherefore, we cannot do U at turn 88? Then we must avoid being on row 5 at turn 89.\n\nAlternative: at turn 88 (when we are at row 4) we could choose S or D? \n\nBut we want to minimize the number of turns. We must eventually go up.\n\nWe might wait at row 4 for a turn? \n\nLet me check: \n  If at turn 88 we do S: then we stay at row 4 for the entire turn 88? Then at the end of turn 88, we are still at row 4? \n  Then at turn 89, we are at row 4 again? \n\nBut then at turn 89, we are at row 4: \n  Check row 4 at time 89: dt=2\n      car on row 4: 48 - 36*2 = 48-72 = -24; 83-72=11 -> so car spans [-24,11] -> 0 is in there -> collision? \n\nBut wait, the car on row 4 at time 89? The car on row 4 is the same as the one we saw at row 4 at time 88? \n\nHowever, note: the car on row 4 is moving and at time 88 it was at [12,47] and at time 89 it is at [-24,11]? That doesn't make sense because the car moves left by 36 per turn? \n\nWait: at time 88: \n  h - s*dt = 48 - 36 = 12\n  τ - s*dt = 83 - 36 = 47 -> so [12,47] (but note: the problem defines the span as [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt] for left, but then the interval is from min to max? \n\nActually, 12 and 47: the car is from 12 to 47. Then at time 89: \n  48 - 36*2 = 48-72 = -24\n  83 - 72 = 11 -> so the car is from -24 to 11. \n\nBut note: the car on row 4 is the same car? and it moves 36 units per turn to the left. \n\nSo if we are at row 4 at time 89, then we are in the car's span? \n\nTherefore, if we do S at turn 88 (so we stay at row 4 for turn 88 and then again at the start of turn 89 we are at row 4) then at turn 89 we are at row 4 and the car covers 0 -> collision.\n\nAlternatively, we could do D at turn 88? Then we move down to row 3? \n\nBut at turn 88, we start at row 4, then we move down to row 3 at the end of turn 88. Then at turn 89, we start at row 3.\n\nCheck row 3 at time 88: we were at row 4 at the start of turn 88 -> so we don't check row 3 at time 88? Only at the start of the turn we are on a row.\n\nAt turn 88: we start at row 4 -> check row 4 at time 88 -> safe (as above: [12,47] doesn't cover 0).\n\nThen we do D: move to row 3 at the end of turn 88. Then at turn 89, we start at row 3.\n\nCheck row 3 at time 89: \n  Freeway 3 has two cars: both right-moving.\n\n  Car1: (24,13,right,12) -> at time 89, dt=2:\n        τ + s*dt = 24 + 12*2 = 24+24 = 48\n        h + s*dt = 13 + 24 = 37 -> so the car is from 37 to 48? -> interval [37,48] -> 0 not in there.\n\n  Car2: (-24,-35,right,12) -> \n        τ = -24, h=-35 -> \n        endpoints: -24 + 24 = 0, -35+24 = -11 -> so the car is from -11 to 0? \n        Actually, the endpoints are 0 and -11 -> so the interval is [-11,0]. \n        0 is in [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSo if we go down to row 3 at turn 88, then at turn 89 we are at row 3 and the car2 covers 0 -> collision.\n\nTherefore, from row 4 at turn 88, we cannot do U (because then at turn 89 we would be at row 5 and collide), we cannot do S (because then at turn 89 we are at row 4 and collide), and we cannot do D (because then at turn 89 we are at row 3 and collide). \n\nSo we must avoid being at row 4 at turn 88? \n\nBut how? We are at turn 87 at row 3. We did U to get to row 4 at turn 88. \n\nSo we must not do U at turn 87? \n\nAlternative: at turn 87, we do S (stay at row 3) or D (down to row 2) and then plan.\n\nBut we want minimal turns. We are going to have to go up eventually.\n\nLet me try staying at row 3 for one more turn.\n\nTurn 87: choose S -> so at the end of turn 87, we are still at row 3. Then turn 88: we start at row 3.\n\nCheck row 3 at time 88: \n  dt = 1\n  Car1: (24,13,right,12) -> endpoints: 24+12=36, 13+12=25 -> [25,36] -> 0 not in.\n  Car2: (-24,-35,right,12) -> endpoints: -24+12=-12, -35+12=-23 -> [-23,-12] -> 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nThen at turn 88, we can choose U to go to row 4? Then at turn 89, we start at row 4.\n\nCheck row 4 at time 89: \n  The car: (48,83,left,36) -> dt=2: 48-72=-24, 83-72=11 -> [-24,11] -> 0 in there -> collision.\n\nSo again, at turn 89 we are at row 4 and collide.\n\nAlternatively, at turn 88 (from row 3) we could choose U? Then we go to row 4 at the end of turn 88 -> so at turn 89 we start at row 4 -> same problem.\n\nSo we must avoid being on row 4 at time 89? \n\nBut if we are on row 4 at time 88, then at time 88 we are safe (because the car at row4 at time88 is at [12,47]) but then at time89 we are at row5? \n\nWait, no: if at turn 88 we are at row3 and we choose U, then at the end of turn88 we move to row4 -> so at the start of turn89 we are at row4. \n\nSo we are on row4 at turn89 -> and the car at row4 at time89 is at [-24,11] -> collision.\n\nBut note: we are not on row4 at time88? We were on row3 at time88 (because we started turn88 at row3) and then we moved to row4 at the end of turn88 -> so at time88 we were on row3 -> safe. Then at time89 we are on row4 -> and we check row4 at time89 -> which is unsafe.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on row4 at time89. \n\nWhat if we delay the move to row4? \n\nSuppose at turn87: S (stay at row3)\nturn88: S (stay at row3) -> then at turn89: we are at row3.\n\nCheck row3 at time89: \n  dt=2\n  Car1: (24,13,right,12) -> 24+24=48, 13+24=37 -> [37,48] -> safe.\n  Car2: (-24,-35,right,12) -> -24+24=0, -35+24=-11 -> [-11,0] -> 0 is in [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSo if we stay at row3 for two turns (turn87 and turn88), then at turn89 we are at row3 and collide.\n\nAlternatively, at turn87: D -> down to row2.\n\nThen at turn88: we start at row2.\n\nCheck row2 at time88: \n  Freeway2: two cars.\n  Car1: (24,13,right,12) -> at time88 (dt=1): 24+12=36, 13+12=25 -> [25,36] -> safe.\n  Car2: (-24,-35,right,12) -> -24+12=-12, -35+12=-23 -> [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nThen we can choose U at turn88: then we go to row3 at the end of turn88 -> so at turn89, we start at row3.\n\nCheck row3 at time89: \n  As above, car2: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nAlternatively, at turn88 (from row2) we choose U again: then we go to row3 at the end of turn88 -> same as above -> collision at turn89.\n\nOr we choose S at turn88: stay at row2 -> then at turn89: start at row2.\n\nCheck row2 at time89: \n  dt=2\n  Car1: 24+24=48, 13+24=37 -> [37,48] -> safe.\n  Car2: -24+24=0, -35+24=-11 -> [-11,0] -> 0 is in -> collision.\n\nSo row2 at time89 is also unsafe? \n\nBut note: the car2 on row2 at time89: the endpoints are 0 and -11 -> so the interval is [-11,0] -> includes 0.\n\nSo row2 at time89 is unsafe.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on row2 at time89.\n\nWe are at row2 at turn88 (if we did D at turn87). Then at turn88 we are at row2 (safe at time88). Then we must leave row2 by turn89? \n\nBut we can only move to row1, row2, or row3? \n\nIf we move to row1 at turn88: \n  Then at turn89, we start at row1.\n\nCheck row1 at time89: \n  Freeway1: one car: (-48,-95,right,48) -> at time89, dt=2:\n        τ = -48? h=-95? \n        But wait: the representation: for right-moving, we have (head, tail) = (-48, -95) and then the span at t1 was [τ, h] = [-95, -48]? \n        Then at time89: \n            τ + s*dt = -95 + 48*2 = -95+96 = 1\n            h + s*dt = -48 + 96 = 48\n        So the car is from 1 to 48? -> interval [1,48] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSo if at turn88 we move from row2 to row1, then at turn89 we are at row1 -> safe.\n\nBut then we are at row1, which is farther from the goal.\n\nWe need to get to row9. We are currently at row1 at turn89.\n\nWe then have to go up. But we must avoid collisions.\n\nThis is getting complicated. We might need to wait until the cars pass.\n\nLet me try to plan:\n\n  turn87: D -> to row2 (at the end of turn87) -> so turn88: start at row2 (safe at time88).\n  turn88: D -> to row1? \n          Then turn89: start at row1 -> safe (as above).\n\nThen at turn89: we are at row1.\n\nWe then want to go up. But let's see the cars at row1 in the future.\n\nAt turn89: row1 is safe. \n  We can then do U at turn89: move to row2 at the end of turn89 -> so turn90: start at row2.\n\nCheck row2 at time90: \n  dt = 90-87 = 3\n  Car1: (24,13,right,12) -> 24+12*3=24+36=60, 13+36=49 -> [49,60] -> safe.\n  Car2: (-24,-35,right,12) -> -24+36=12, -35+36=1 -> [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo at turn90, row2 is safe.\n\nThen we can do U: to row3 at turn90 -> then turn91: start at row3.\n\nCheck row3 at time91: \n  dt=4\n  Car1: 24+48=72, 13+48=61 -> [61,72] -> safe.\n  Car2: -24+48=24, -35+48=13 -> [13,24] -> safe.\n\nThen we can do U: to row4 at turn91 -> then turn92: start at row4.\n\nCheck row4 at time92: \n  The car: left-moving: (48,83,left,36) -> \n      h - s*dt = 48 - 36*5 (since dt=92-87=5) = 48-180 = -132\n      τ - s*dt = 83 - 180 = -97\n      So the car is from -132 to -97? -> safe.\n\nThen we can continue upward.\n\nBut wait, we are at turn92 at row4. We need to go to row9.\n\nBut we have to go through rows 5,6,7,8.\n\nCheck row5 at time92: \n  The car on row5: same as row4? (48,83,left,36) -> at time92: \n      h - s*dt = 48 - 36*5 = -132\n      τ - s*dt = 83 - 180 = -97 -> so the car is at [-132,-97] -> safe.\n\nBut note: we are not on row5 at time92, we are on row4 at time92. We are planning to move to row5 at the end of turn92.\n\nThen at turn93: start at row5.\n\nCheck row5 at time93: \n  dt=6\n      48 - 36*6 = 48-216 = -168\n      83 - 216 = -133 -> so the car is at [-168,-133] -> safe.\n\nThen we move to row6 at turn93: \n  turn94: start at row6.\n\nFreeway6: one car: (0,-11,right,6) -> right-moving, so at t1: head=0, tail=-11? \n  For right-moving: span at t1: [τ, h] = [-11,0] -> so it covers 0 at t1? \n\nBut at t1 (turn87) we are not on row6. \n\nAt time94: dt=94-87=7\n      τ + s*dt = -11 + 6*7 = -11+42=31\n      h + s*dt = 0+42=42 -> [31,42] -> safe.\n\nThen we move to row7 at turn94: \n  turn95: start at row7.\n\nFreeway7: two cars:\n  Car1: (-32,-43,right,4) -> right-moving: at time95, dt=8:\n        τ + s*dt = -43 + 4*8 = -43+32 = -11\n        h + s*dt = -32+32=0 -> so the car is from -11 to 0 -> 0 is included -> collision.\n\nOh no! So at turn95, if we are on row7, we collide.\n\nSo we must avoid row7 at time95.\n\nWe need to adjust.\n\nAt turn94: we are at row6. Instead of going up to row7, we might wait at row6? \n  But check row6 at time95: \n      dt=8\n      car: (0,-11,right,6) -> \n          τ + s*dt = -11+48=37, h + s*dt=0+48=48 -> [37,48] -> safe.\n\nSo we can do S at turn94: stay at row6.\n\nThen at turn95: we start at row6 (safe).\n\nThen at turn95: we can move to row7? \n  Check row7 at time95: \n      Car1: as above, [-11,0] -> 0 is in -> unsafe.\n\nBut we can avoid row7 at time95 by waiting? \n\nAlternatively, we could move to row7 at a later turn.\n\nCheck row7 at time96: \n  dt=9\n  Car1: (-32,-43,right,4) -> \n        τ = -43, h=-32 -> \n        endpoints: -43+36 = -7, -32+36=4 -> [-7,4] -> 0 is in -> unsafe.\n\nAt time97: \n  dt=10: -43+40=-3, -32+40=8 -> [-3,8] -> 0 in -> unsafe.\n\nAt time98: \n  dt=11: -43+44=1, -32+44=12 -> [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo at time98, row7 is safe.\n\nTherefore, we can plan to be on row7 at time98.\n\nBut we are at row6 at time95 (if we stayed at row6 at turn94 and then turn95 we did S again?).\n\nLet me recap the entire sequence so far:\n\n  turn87: D -> to row2 (so at turn88: start at row2)\n  turn88: D -> to row1 (turn89: start at row1)\n  turn89: U -> to row2 (turn90: start at row2)\n  turn90: U -> to row3 (turn91: start at row3)\n  turn91: U -> to row4 (turn92: start at row4)\n  turn92: U -> to row5 (turn93: start at row5)\n  turn93: U -> to row6 (turn94: start at row6)\n\nNow at turn94: we are at row6. We want to avoid row7 at time95,96,97? \n\nAt turn94: we are at row6. We can do:\n  Option 1: Stay at row6 for 3 more turns? \n      turn94: S -> then turn95: row6 (safe at time95: [37,48])\n      turn95: S -> then turn96: row6 (dt=9: -11+54=43, 0+54=54 -> [43,54] -> safe)\n      turn96: S -> then turn97: row6 (dt=10: -11+60=49, 0+60=60 -> safe)\n      Then at turn97: we do U to row7 -> then turn98: start at row7 (which is safe, as above).\n\nBut that takes 3 extra turns.\n\nOption 2: Maybe we can go up to row7 at a time when it is safe? But the next safe time for row7 is time98.\n\nWe are at row6 at time94. \n  If we do U at turn94: then we are at row7 at turn95 -> unsafe.\n  If we do U at turn95: then we are at row7 at turn96 -> unsafe.\n  If we do U at turn96: then we are at row7 at turn97 -> unsafe.\n  If we do U at turn97: then we are at row7 at turn98 -> safe.\n\nSo we must wait at row6 until turn97? \n\nThat is, at turn94: S (stay at row6)\n  turn95: S (stay at row6)\n  turn96: S (stay at row6)\n  turn97: U (to row7) -> then at turn98: start at row7 (safe).\n\nThen from row7 at turn98, we can go up.\n\nBut we also have to check the next rows.\n\nAt turn98: we are at row7 -> safe (as above: car1 at [1,12] -> doesn't cover 0? \n  Actually, at time98: \n      Car1: (-32,-43,right,4): dt=11 -> -43+44=1, -32+44=12 -> [1,12] -> safe.\n      Car2: (32,21,right,4) -> \n            Note: the input: (32,21,right,4) -> head=32, tail=21? \n            For right: span at t1: [τ, h] = [21,32] -> \n            at time98 (dt=11): 21+44=65, 32+44=76 -> [65,76] -> safe.\n\nSo row7 at time98 is safe.\n\nThen we do U at turn98: to row8 -> turn99: start at row8.\n\nCheck row8 at time99: \n  Freeway8: (-24,-35,right,3) -> right-moving: head=-24, tail=-35? \n      At t1: span [τ, h] = [-35,-24]\n      dt=12: \n          τ + s*dt = -35 + 3*12 = -35+36=1\n          h + s*dt = -24+36=12 -> [1,12] -> safe.\n\nThen we do U at turn99: to row9 -> turn100: start at row9 -> goal.\n\nSo total turns: from turn87 to turn100 -> H = 100-87+1? \n\nBut note: we start at turn87, and we take actions from turn87 to turn99 (13 actions) to get to row9 at turn100.\n\nBut the problem: we need the minimal number of turns. \n\nLet me count the turns:\n\n  We are at turn87: we do action (D) -> then we are at the end of turn87 at row2.\n  Then turn88: D -> row1.\n  turn89: U -> row2.\n  turn90: U -> row3.\n  turn91: U -> row4.\n  turn92: U -> row5.\n  turn93: U -> row6.\n  turn94: S -> row6.\n  turn95: S -> row6.\n  turn96: S -> row6.\n  turn97: U -> row7.\n  turn98: U -> row8.\n  turn99: U -> row9.\n\nSo we have 13 actions: from turn87 to turn99.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWe avoided row3 and row2 at time89 by going down to row1, but then we had to come back.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can go up to row4 at a different time.\n\nLet me reconsider the initial moves.\n\nWe are at row3 at turn87. We want to avoid being on row3 and row2 at time89 (because both are unsafe at time89).\n\nWe could go to row4 at turn87: \n  turn87: U -> to row4 (turn88: start at row4) -> safe at time88 (car at [12,47]).\n  Then at turn88: we must leave row4 to avoid being on row4 at time89 (which is unsafe).\n\nWhere can we go?\n  U: to row5 -> then turn89: start at row5 -> check row5 at time89: \n        car on row5: (48,83,left,36) -> \n            dt=2: 48-72=-24, 83-72=11 -> [-24,11] -> 0 in -> collision.\n\n  D: to row3 -> then turn89: start at row3 -> collision (as above, car2 on row3: [-11,0]).\n\n  S: then at turn89: row4 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot stay at row4 at turn88.\n\nTherefore, we must leave row4 at turn88, but both U and D lead to collision at turn89.\n\nSo the only option is to not be at row4 at turn88? \n\nBut we are at row4 at turn88 because we moved there at turn87.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid moving to row4 at turn87.\n\nBut then we are stuck at row3 at turn87: we cannot stay (because then turn88 we are at row3, and then we can move to row4 at turn88, but then turn89 row4 is unsafe) and we cannot go down to row2 at turn87 because then at turn88 we are at row2 and then we cannot avoid row2 and row3 at time89.\n\nUnless we go down to row2 at turn87 and then at turn88 we go down to row1? \n\nThat's what we did earlier.\n\nBut that took 13 turns.\n\nWe could try to go to row5 or higher directly? \n\nBut we can only move one row per turn.\n\nAnother idea: at turn87: S (stay at row3) -> turn88: row3 -> safe (as above).\n  Then at turn88: D -> to row2? \n        Then turn89: start at row2 -> unsafe (car2 on row2: [-11,0] at time89).\n\n  Or turn88: U -> to row4 -> then turn89: row4 -> unsafe.\n\n  Or turn88: S -> then turn89: row3 -> unsafe.\n\nSo no.\n\nWe must leave row3 before time89.\n\nTherefore, at turn87 we must move: either U or D.\n\nU: to row4 -> then turn88: row4 -> then we are stuck (as above).\nD: to row2 -> then turn88: row2 -> then we can go to row1 (as we did) to avoid the collision at time89.\n\nSo the down path is one possibility.\n\nBut is there a way to get to row9 faster than 13 turns?\n\nWe could consider going to row0? But the grid is y=0 to 9, and at y=0 we cannot go down. But y=0 is not a freeway? The freeways are 1-8. So at y=0, no collision check. \n\nBut we start at row3 at turn87.

We then waited until turn97 to go to row7 (so time98 for row7) to avoid the car on row7 at times95,96,97.\n\nBut what if we go from row6 to row7 at a time when the car is not covering 0? \n\nWe saw that the car on row7 covers 0 from time89 to time97? \n\nSpecifically, the car1 on row7: \n  It covers 0 when the interval includes 0.\n\n  The car: endpoints: \n      time89: dt=2: -43+8=-35, -32+8=-24 -> [-35,-24] -> safe? \n          Actually, we did not check row7 at time89? \n      time90: dt=3: -43+12=-31, -32+12=-20 -> safe.\n      time91: dt=4: -43+16=-27, -32+16=-16 -> safe.\n      time92: dt=5: -43+20=-23, -32+20=-12 -> safe.\n      time93: dt=6: -43+24=-19, -32+24=-8 -> safe.\n      time94: dt=7: -43+28=-15, -32+28=-4 -> safe.\n      time95: dt=8: -43+32=-11, -32+32=0 -> [-11,0] -> collision.\n      time96: dt=9: -43+36=-7, -32+36=4 -> [-7,4] -> collision.\n      time97: dt=10: -43+40=-3, -32+40=8 -> [-3,8] -> collision.\n      time98: dt=11: -43+44=1, -32+44=12 -> [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo actually, the car covers 0 only from time95 to time97. \n\nTherefore, if we can be on row7 at time94 or earlier, or at time98 or later, we are safe.\n\nIn the first plan, we were at row6 at turn94 (time94) and we could not get to row7 at time94? \n\nTo be at row7 at time94, we would have to be at row6 at time93 and then do U at turn93.\n\nIn the first plan, we were at row5 at time93 (because at turn93 we moved to row6, so at time93 we were at row5? No: \n\nLet me recap the first plan:\n\n  turn87: D -> to row2 (time87: at row3, then move to row2 -> so at time88: at row2)\n  turn88: D -> to row1 (time89: at row1)\n  turn89: U -> to row2 (time90: at row2)\n  turn90: U -> to row3 (time91: at row3)\n  turn91: U -> to row4 (time92: at row4)\n  turn92: U -> to row5 (time93: at row5)\n  turn93: U -> to row6 (time94: at row6)\n\nSo at time94, we are at row6. \n\nTo be at row7 at time94, we would have to be at row6 at time93 and then do U at turn93.\n\nBut how to be at row6 at time93?\n\nIn the first plan, we were at row5 at time93.\n\nWe could try to speed up the initial descent and then ascent.\n\n  turn87: D -> row2 (time88: row2)\n  turn88: D -> row1 (time89: row1)\n  turn89: D -> row0 (time90: row0) -> then we are at row0 at time90.\n\nBut then we have to go up 9 rows.\n\nAlternatively, we could go down only to row1 and then up.\n\n  turn87: D -> row2 (time88: row2)\n  turn88: D -> row1 (time89: row1) -> then at time89, row1 is safe (car at [1,48]? \n        For row1 at time89: \n            car: (-48,-95,right,48) -> dt=2: -95+96=1, -48+96=48 -> [1,48] -> safe.\n        Then turn89: U -> row2 (time90: row2) -> safe (row2 at time90: as above, [25,36] and [1,12]? \n            Actually, row2 at time90: \n                Car1: (24,13,right,12) -> 24+36=60, 13+36=49 -> [49,60] -> safe.\n                Car2: (-24,-35,right,12) -> -24+36=12, -35+36=1 -> [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        Then turn90: U -> row3 (time91: row3) -> \n            row3 at time91: \n                Car1: 24+48=72, 13+48=61 -> [61,72] -> safe.\n                Car2: -24+48=24, -35+48=13 -> [13,24] -> safe.\n\n        Then turn91: U -> row4 (time92: row4) -> \n            row4 at time92: car left: 48-180=-132, 83-180=-97 -> safe.\n\n        Then turn92: U -> row5 (time93: row5) -> safe (same car: -132,-97 -> safe).\n\n        Then turn93: U -> row6 (time94: row6) -> \n            row6 at time94: car: (0,-11,right,6) -> -11+42=31, 0+42=42 -> [31,42] -> safe.\n\n        Then turn94: U -> row7 (time95: row7) -> \n            row7 at time95: car1: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSame problem.\n\nBut if we could be at row6 at time93, then we could do U at turn93 to be at row7 at time94 (which is safe).\n\nHow to be at row6 at time93?\n\nWe are at row3 at turn87. \n\nWe want to be at row6 at time93, meaning we start turn93 at row6.\n\nWe need to move up 3 rows in 6 turns (from turn87 to turn92 inclusive) because:\n  turn87: action -> at turn88: new row\n  ...\n  turn92: action -> at turn93: new row.\n\nSo we need to go from row3 to row6 in 6 moves? That means we can use 3 U moves and 3 S moves? \n\nBut we have 6 actions: turn87 to turn92.\n\nWe can do: U, U, U, and then three S? \n\nBut let's see:\n\n  turn87: U -> row4 (time88: row4) -> must be safe at time88: \n        row4 at time88: car left: 48-36=12, 83-36=47 -> safe.\n\n  turn88: U -> row5 (time89: row5) -> \n        row5 at time89: car left: 48-72=-24, 83-72=11 -> [-24,11] -> collision.\n\nSo cannot do U at turn88.\n\nAlternatively, turn87: U -> row4 (time88: row4) safe.\n  turn88: S -> row4 (time89: row4) -> unsafe (car at [-24,11]).\n\n  turn87: U -> row4 (time88: row4) safe.\n  turn88: D -> row3 (time89: row3) -> unsafe (car on row3 at time89: [0,-11] -> collision).\n\n  turn87: S -> row3 (time88: row3) safe.\n  turn88: U -> row4 (time89: row4) unsafe.\n\nSo it seems we cannot be at row6 by time93 without encountering a collision.\n\nTherefore, our first plan (13 turns) might be the best.\n\nBut let's see if we can reduce the waiting time at row6.\n\nIn the first plan, we had to wait at row6 for turns94,95,96 (3 turns) and then move to row7 at turn97 (so time98).\n\nBut we saw that row7 is safe at time94. \n\nSo if we can be at row7 at time94, that would be safe.\n\nHow to be at row7 at time94? \n  We need to be at row6 at time93 and then do U at turn93.\n\nHow to be at row6 at time93? \n  We need to be at row5 at time92 and then do U at turn92.\n\nHow to be at row5 at time92? \n  We need to be at row4 at time91 and then do U at turn91.\n\nHow to be at row4 at time91? \n  We need to be at row3 at time90 and then do U at turn90.\n\nHow to be at row3 at time90? \n  We need to be at row2 at time89 and then do U at turn89.\n\nHow to be at row2 at time89? \n  We need to be at row1 at time88 and then do U at turn88.\n\nHow to be at row1 at time88? \n  We need to be at row0 at time87 and then do U at turn87? But we start at row3 at time87.\n\nAlternatively, from row3 at time87, we can do D at turn87 to row2 (time88: row2), then D at turn88 to row1 (time89: row1), then U at turn89 to row2 (time90: row2) -> then we are at row2 at time90, but we want to be at row2 at time89? \n\nWe want to be at row1 at time88: \n  turn87: D -> row2 (time88: row2) -> then we are at row2 at time88, not row1.\n\nTo be at row1 at time88, we would have to be at row2 at time87 and then do D at turn87. But we start at row3 at time87.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at row1 is time88: \n  turn87: D -> row2 (time88: row2)\n  turn88: D -> row1 (time89: row1)\n\nSo we are at row1 at time89.\n\nThen turn89: U -> row2 (time90: row2)\nturn90: U -> row3 (time91: row3)\nturn91: U -> row4 (time92: row4)\nturn92: U -> row5 (time93: row5)\nturn93: U -> row6 (time94: row6)\nturn94: U -> row7 (time95: row7) -> unsafe.\n\nSo we are at row7 at time95 -> unsafe.\n\nTherefore, we cannot achieve row7 at time94.\n\nGiven the constraints, the first plan (with 13 actions) is valid and minimal? \n\nBut is there a plan with fewer than 13 actions?\n\nMinimal moves without any waiting: 6 moves upward (from 3 to 9) -> 6 actions. But we know we have to avoid collisions, so we may need to detour and wait.\n\nIn our first plan, we used 6 upward moves and 2 downward moves and 5 stays? \n  Actions: \n      D, D, U, U, U, U, U, S, S, S, U, U, U \n  That's 13 actions: \n      D:2, U:8, S:3 -> total moves: net upward = 8 - 2 = 6, and 3 stays.\n\nBut we also passed through row0 in an alternative plan? That took more actions.\n\nAnother idea: avoid the initial descent and try to wait at row3 until the unsafe period for row3 and row2 passes.\n\nThe unsafe period for row3 and row2 is at time89? \n  For row3: unsafe at time89 (car2: [-11,0]) and then becomes safe at time90? \n  For row2: unsafe at time89 (car2: [-11,0]) and then safe at time90.\n\nSo if we can be at row3 at time90, then safe.\n\nHow to be at row3 at time90? \n  We start at row3 at time87.\n\n  turn87: S -> row3 (time88: row3) -> safe (as before).\n  turn88: S -> row3 (time89: row3) -> unsafe (car2: [-11,0]).\n\n  turn87: U -> row4 (time88: row4) -> safe.\n  turn88: ? -> as before, we get stuck.\n\n  turn87: D -> row2 (time88: row2) -> safe.\n  turn88: U -> row3 (time89: row3) -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at row3 at time90 without being at row3 or row2 at time89.\n\nTherefore, we must be at row1 or row0 at time89.\n\nWe chose row1 in the first plan.\n\nBut then we have to spend turns to go up.\n\nWe could go to row0 at time89: \n  turn87: D -> row2 (time88: row2)\n  turn88: D -> row1 (time89: row1)\n  turn89: D -> row0 (time90: row0) -> safe.\n\nThen from row0, we can go up.\n\nBut it takes one extra move (the D at turn89) compared to going up from row1 at turn89.\n\nIn the first plan, from row1 at time89, we did U at turn89 to row2 at time90.\n\nIf we go to row0, then at turn89 we do D to row0, then at turn90 we do U to row1, which is the same as being at row1 at time91? \n\n  turn89: D -> row0 (time90: row0)\n  turn90: U -> row1 (time91: row1)\n\nWhereas in the first plan, we were at row1 at time89 and then at turn89 we did U to row2 at time90.\n\nSo the first plan is faster.\n\nTherefore, the first plan we had is the fastest we can get.\n\nSo we'll go with the first plan:\n\n  turn87: D\n  turn88: D\n  turn89: U\n  turn90: U\n  turn91: U\n  turn92: U\n  turn93: U\n  turn94: S\n  turn95: S\n  turn96: S\n  turn97: U\n  turn98: U\n  turn99: U\n\nAnd then at turn100, we are at row9.\n\nBut note: we only need to provide the actions until we reach row9 at the end of an action.\n\nWe reach row9 at the end of turn99, so the last action is at turn99.\n\nSo the actions are from turn87 to turn99 (13 actions).\n\nLet me verify the entire sequence:\n\n  Start: turn87, y=3.\n  turn87: D -> y=2 (end of turn87). Then at turn88: start at y=2.\n      Check row2 at time88: \n          Car1: (24,13,right,12) -> 24+12=36, 13+12=25 -> [25,36] -> safe.\n          Car2: (-24,-35,right,12) -> -24+12=-12, -35+12=-23 -> [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n  turn88: D -> y=1 (end of turn88).

Then we are at (0,9) at the end of turn99.\n\nWe have provided 13 actions, and we reached at turn99 (the last action is turn99).\n\nBut the problem asks for the minimal number of turns H and the sequence. \n\nThe minimal H is 13 turns? \n\nNote: the sequence is for turns from t1=87 to t1+H-1 = 87+12=99, so H=13.\n\nBut let me confirm the definition: \n  We start at turn87, and we take actions at turns 87, 88, ..., 99 (13 actions) and then after the action at turn99, we are at (0,9).\n\nSo the minimal H is 13.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 87: D\nTurn 88: D\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: S\nTurn 95: S\nTurn 96: S\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\nTurn 99: U\n}\n\nBut wait, in the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n\nt1=87, so:\n\nTurn 87: D\nTurn 88: D\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: S\nTurn 95: S\nTurn 96: S\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\nTurn 99: U\n\nBut we have 13 lines, and the last action is at turn99.\n\nThis matches.\n\nWe'll go with that.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 87 is 13. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by moving down initially to avoid unsafe rows at critical times, then moving up while waiting at row 6 for three turns to avoid a collision on row 7.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- At turn 87, move down (D) to row 2, safe on row 3 at time 87.\n- At turn 88, move down (D) to row 1, safe on row 2 at time 88.\n- At turn 89, move up (U) to row 2, safe on row 1 at time 89.\n- At turn 90, move up (U) to row 3, safe on row 2 at time 90.\n- At turn 91, move up (U) to row 4, safe on row 3 at time 91.\n- At turn 92, move up (U) to row 5, safe on row 4 at time 92.\n- At turn 93, move up (U) to row 6, safe on row 5 at time 93.\n- At turn 94, stay (S) at row 6, safe on row 6 at time 94.\n- At turn 95, stay (S) at row 6, safe on row 6 at time 95.\n- At turn 96, stay (S) at row 6, safe on row 6 at time 96.\n- At turn 97, move up (U) to row 7, safe on row 6 at time 97.\n- At turn 98, move up (U) to row 8, safe on row 7 at time 98.\n- At turn 99, move up (U) to row 9, safe on row 8 at time 99.\n\nAfter turn 99, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 87: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 88: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 89: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 90: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 91: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 92: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 93: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 94: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 95: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 96: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 97: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 98: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 99: \\text{U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 through y=8. Collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. The cars are given at turn t_1 = 88, and I need to find actions for turns starting from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, ending at y=9.\n\nThe player update is simple: U increases y by 1, D decreases by 1, S stays. y is clamped between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9. Starting from y=2, I need to reach y=9, so I need a net increase of 7. Since I can only move one step per turn, the minimum H should be at least 7, but I might need more if I have to avoid cars by staying or moving down sometimes.\n\nH is the number of turns, so if I start at t_1 and take actions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to t_1+H-1, then after H turns, I'm at y_{t_1 + H}. Let's clarify the indexing.\n\nAt turn t, before action a_t, position is y_t. After action a_t, position becomes y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nI start at turn t_1 with position (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,2).\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, position is y_{t_1+1}.\n\nAnd so on, until at some turn T = t_1 + H, position should be (0,9), but let's see.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1. So actions at times: t_1 + 0, t_1 + 1, ..., t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H - 1}, position is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nSince we start at y_{t_1} = 2, and each action changes y by -1,0,1, to reach 9 from 2, we need a net +7, so minimum H actions if all are U, but y must be integer, so from 2 to 9, difference 7, so min H=7 if we can go up every turn without collision.\n\nBut we might have to detour or wait, so H could be more.\n\nNow, collision: at turn T, if I am on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that exact turn T.\n\nImportant note: when I move to a new freeway, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I decide action to go to y_{T+1}. But at turn T, I am on y_T, so I check collision on y_T at turn T.\n\nIf I move to y_{T+1} at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1, so at turn T, I am still on y_T for collision purposes.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, I am always on y_T for collision, regardless of what action I take. Action affects where I will be at T+1, but at T, I am on y_T.\n\nCollision is checked only at the turn when I am on the freeway.\n\nNow, I need to simulate the car positions over time.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway at t_1=88.\n\nFreeway k=1: one car: head h=0, tail τ=-47, direction right, speed s=48.\n\nSince direction is right, and span is given as (h, τ) = (0, -47), but for right-moving, span is [τ, h] because τ is tail, h is head, so [τ, h] = [-47, 0]? Let's see the update.\n\nFor right-moving car: at turn t_1, span is [τ, h], and at turn T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: span at t_1 is [h, τ], at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car state table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor freeway 1: (h=0, τ=-47, d=right, s=48)\n\nSince d=right, at t_1, span is [τ, h] = [-47, 0]\n\nAt time T, span = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-47 + 48(T-88), 0 + 48(T-88)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut for collision, we care about when 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway I'm on.\n\nSince I'm at x=0, collision if 0 is in the car's span.\n\nNow, freeway 2: two cars: (36,25,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFirst car: d=right, so span at t_1: [τ, h] = [25,36]? Head h=36, tail τ=25? But typically head is the front, so for right-moving, if it's moving right, head should be larger if x increases right.\n\nAssume x-axis: left to right, so for right-moving car, head is on the right, tail on left, so span [tail, head] = [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head on left, tail on right, span [head, tail] with head < tail? Not necessarily, but in the update, for left-moving, span is [h, τ] and it moves left.\n\nIn the given, for freeway 2, first car: (h=36, τ=25, d=right, s=12)\n\nSince d=right, span at t_1: [τ, h] = [25,36]\n\nAt T, [25 + 12(T-88), 36 + 12(T-88)]\n\nSecond car: (h=-12, τ=-23, d=right, s=12)\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nAt T, [-23 + 12(T-88), -12 + 12(T-88)]\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (36,25,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12) — identical to freeway 2. Is that possible? Maybe, or typo? I'll assume it's the same.\n\nFreeway 4: (12,47,left,36) — d=left, so span at t_1: [h, τ] = [12,47] since for left-moving, it's [head, tail] with head left.\n\nIn the update: left-moving, span at t_1 [h, τ], at T [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSo here h=12, τ=47, so [12,47] at t_1.\n\nAt T, [12 - 36(T-88), 47 - 36(T-88)]\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same as 4? (12,47,left,36)\n\nFreeway 6: (6,-5,right,6) — d=right, h=6, τ=-5? τ=-5, h=6, so span [τ,h] = [-5,6] at t_1.\n\nAt T, [-5 + 6(T-88), 6 + 6(T-88)]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-28,-39,right,4) and (36,25,right,4)\n\nFirst: d=right, h=-28, τ=-39? τ=-39, h=-28, span [τ,h] = [-39,-28] at t_1.\n\nAt T, [-39 +4(T-88), -28 +4(T-88)]\n\nSecond: h=36, τ=25, d=right, s=4, span [25,36] at t_1, at T [25+4(T-88),36+4(T-88)]\n\nFreeway 8: (-21,-32,right,3) — d=right, h=-21, τ=-32, span [τ,h] = [-32,-21] at t_1.\n\nAt T, [-32 +3(T-88), -21 +3(T-88)]\n\nNow, I start at y=2 at turn t_1=88.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=2 is freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I assume no cars there, so no collision on y=0 or y=9.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, y=9 top, both safe.\n\nAt turn t_1=88, I am on y=2, which is a freeway, so I need to check if there is collision at t_1 on y=2.\n\nFreeway 2 has cars: let's see if 0 is in any span at T=88.\n\nFirst car on y=2: span [25,36] at T=88, 0 not in [25,36].\n\nSecond car: span [-23,-12], 0 not in [-23,-12].\n\nSo at t_1, on y=2, no collision, good.\n\nNow, I need to move up to y=9.\n\nBut I have to avoid cars on y=1 to 8 when I am on them.\n\nSince I start at y=2, and need to go to y=9, I must pass through y=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut I can stay or move down to avoid, but that might increase H.\n\nI should find for each freeway and each turn, whether position x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nThat is, for each freeway k, and time T, is 0 in the span of any car on k at T.\n\nIf I am on freeway k at turn T, and 0 is occupied, collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nSince I can choose actions, I can be on different y at different times.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway, the times when x=0 is occupied.\n\nFor a given freeway k, with cars, for each car, the span at time T is a function of T.\n\n0 is in span if min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nSince span is an interval.\n\nFor simplicity, let τ_rel = T - t_1 = T - 88, so time relative to t_1.\n\nSet t = T - 88, so at t=0, current time.\n\nThen for each car, span at time t (relative).\n\nFreeway 1: one car, right-moving, s=48, span at t: [-47 + 48t, 0 + 48t] = [48t - 47, 48t]\n\n0 in span if 48t - 47 <= 0 <= 48t\n\nSince 48t -47 <=0 and 0<=48t.\n\n0<=48t always for t>=0, since t integer >=0.\n\n48t -47 <=0 => t <= 47/48 <1, so t=0.\n\nAt t=0, 48*0 -47 = -47 <=0 <=0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nAt t=0, span [-47,0], 0 is the head, so yes, 0 is occupied.\n\nBut at t=0, on freeway 1, is there a car at x=0?\n\nFreeway 1: at t=0, span [-47,0], so x=0 is occupied.\n\nNow, for collision, at turn T, if I am on freeway 1 and 0 in span.\n\nAt t=0 (T=88), if I were on freeway 1, I would collide, but I am on y=2, not y=1.\n\nBut later if I go to y=1, I need to avoid when 0 occupied.\n\nSo for freeway 1, 0 in span when 48t -47 <=0 <=48t\n\nAs above, 0<=48t always true for t>=0.\n\n48t-47<=0 => t <= 47/48 <1, so only at t=0.\n\nAt t=0, it holds.\n\nFor t>=1, 48t -47 >=48-47=1>0, so min>0, 0 not in [min,max] since min>0.\n\nSimilarly, max=48t >0, but min>0, so 0 not in interval.\n\nSo only at t=0, x=0 occupied on freeway 1.\n\nBut t=0 is now, and I am not on it.\n\nFor future, t>=1, not occupied.\n\nSo freeway 1 is always safe for t>=1.\n\nt relative, t=0 is now.\n\nFor times t>=1, freeway 1 has no car at x=0.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: right, s=12, span at t: [25 +12t, 36 +12t]\n\n0 in span if 25+12t <=0<=36+12t? No.\n\nSpan [25+12t, 36+12t], min=25+12t, max=36+12t.\n\nSince min=25+12t >=25>0 for t>=0, so min>0, 0 not in [min,max].\n\nSimilarly, second car: span [-23 +12t, -12 +12t]\n\n0 in span if -23+12t <=0<= -12+12t\n\nWhich is -23+12t <=0 and 0<= -12+12t\n\nFirst: -23+12t <=0 => 12t <=23 => t <= 23/12 = 1.916, so t<=1\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12+12t => 12 <=12t => t>=1\n\nSo both: t>=1 and t<=1, so t=1.\n\nAt t=1, span: min=-23+12*1= -23+12= -11, max=-12+12=0\n\nSo [-11,0], so 0 is included (head).\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nFor example t=0: min=-23, max=-12, 0 not in [-23,-12]\n\nt=2: min=-23+24=1, max=-12+24=12, 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo only at t=1, x=0 occupied by second car on freeway 2.\n\nBut freeway 2 has two cars, first one never has 0, second only at t=1.\n\nSo on freeway 2, occupied only at t=1.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2, since cars identical. So also occupied only at t=1.\n\nFreeway 4: one car, left-moving, (h=12, τ=47, d=left, s=36)\n\nSpan at t: [h - s t, τ - s t] = [12 - 36t, 47 - 36t]\n\n0 in span if 12-36t <=0<=47-36t\n\nWhich is 12-36t <=0 and 0<=47-36t\n\nFirst: 12-36t <=0 => 12<=36t => t>=12/36=1/3, so t>=1 since t integer\n\nSecond: 0<=47-36t => 36t<=47 => t<=47/36≈1.305, so t<=1\n\nThus t>=1 and t<=1, so t=1.\n\nAt t=1, min=12-36= -24, max=47-36=11, so [-24,11], 0 included.\n\nFor t=0: min=12, max=47, both >0, 0 not in.\n\nt=2: min=12-72=-60, max=47-72=-25, both <0, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at t=1, occupied.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same as 4, so occupied only at t=1.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car, right-moving, (h=6, τ=-5, d=right, s=6)\n\nSpan at t: [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-5 +6t, 6 +6t]\n\n0 in span if -5+6t <=0<=6+6t\n\n-5+6t <=0 => 6t<=5 => t<=5/6<1, so t<=0\n\n0<=6+6t always true for t>=0\n\nThus only possible at t=0.\n\nAt t=0, min=-5, max=6, 0 in [-5,6], yes.\n\nFor t>=1, min=-5+6t >=1>0 for t>=1, so 0 not in.\n\nThus on freeway 6, occupied only at t=0.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-28,-39,right,4) — h=-28?

So if I go to y=1 later, it's safe since only t=0 occupied.\n\n- Similarly, y=2 occupied only at t=1. At t=0, not occupied, I am safe. At t=1, if I am on y=2, I would collide.\n\n- y=3 same, occupied at t=1.\n\n- y=4 occupied at t=1.\n\n- y=5 occupied at t=1.\n\n- y=6 occupied only at t=0, so for t>=1, safe.\n\n- y=7 occupied at t=7,8,9\n\n- y=8 occupied at t=7,8,9,10\n\nNow, I need to be on each freeway only when not occupied.\n\nBut I have to traverse them.\n\nStart at t=0, y=2.\n\nAt t=0, y=2 not occupied, safe.\n\nNow, I need to decide actions: U, D, or S.\n\nEach action changes y for next turn.\n\nI want to minimize H, so prefer to go up.\n\nBut let's see if I can go up directly.\n\nSuppose I always go U, starting from t=0.\n\nAction at t=0: U, then y_{t=1} = y_0 +1 = 2+1=3? Let's index properly.\n\nSet t relative: at time t (after t actions? Better to think of position at time t.\n\nDefine: at turn T = t_1 + t, position y_t.\n\nt=0: T=t_1, y=2\n\nAfter action a_t (at time T=t_1+t), position becomes y_{t+1} for next turn.\n\nStandard: at turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nIn terms of relative t: let time index τ, where τ=0,1,2,... for turns starting from t_1.\n\nSo at turn τ=0: position y_0 = 2\n\nAction a_0 at τ=0: then y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\nSimilarly, at turn τ, position y_τ, action a_τ, then y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ\n\ny_{τ+1} is position at next turn.\n\nWe want for some H, y_H = 9, after H actions or H turns?\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn τ=H, position y_H.\n\nStarted at τ=0, y_0=2.\n\nAfter first action at τ=0, position at τ=1 is y_1.\n\nAfter second action at τ=1, position at τ=2, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, position at τ=k.\n\nWe want y_H = 9 for some H.\n\ny_0=2, so to reach y=9, need y_H - y_0 =7, so net up 7, so H >=7.\n\nIf all U, y_H = 2 + H, set equal 9, H=7.\n\ny_H = y_0 + sum of Δy from τ=0 to H-1.\n\nSet y_H =9, y_0=2, so sum_{τ=0}^{H-1} Δy_τ =7.\n\nEach Δy_τ in {-1,0,1}, so min H when all Δy=1, H=7.\n\nNow, collision at turn τ: if on freeway y_τ, and x=0 occupied on that freeway at time τ.\n\nTime τ corresponds to absolute turn T = t_1 + τ.\n\nIn relative terms, at time τ, we check occupancy for freeway y_τ at relative time τ.\n\nNow, in the occupancy above, I used t for relative time, same as τ here.\n\nSo for freeway k, occupied at times as above.\n\nNow, back to always up: actions all U, so a_τ = U for each τ.\n\nThen y_τ = 2 + τ for τ=0 to 7? y_0=2, a_0=U, y_1=3, a_1=U, y_2=4, ..., up to y_7=9.\n\ny_0=2, after a_0=U, y_1=3\n\nAfter a_1=U, y_2=4\n\n...\n\nAfter a_6=U, y_7=8+1=9? y_6: at τ=6, y_6 = y_0 +6 =2+6=8? Let's list:\n\nτ | y_τ | action a_τ | next y_{τ+1}\n\nAt τ=0: y_0=2, a_0=U, then y_1=3\n\nAt τ=1: y_1=3, a_1=U, y_2=4\n\nAt τ=2: y_2=4, a_2=U, y_3=5\n\nAt τ=3: y_3=5, a_3=U, y_4=6\n\nAt τ=4: y_4=6, a_4=U, y_5=7\n\nAt τ=5: y_5=7, a_5=U, y_6=8\n\nAt τ=6: y_6=8, a_6=U, y_7=9\n\nAt τ=7: y_7=9, which is the goal, no action needed? We need to reach position at some turn.\n\nAfter action at τ=6, y_7=9, so at turn τ=7, position is 9.\n\nH is such that y_H =9.\n\nIn this case, with actions from τ=0 to τ=6, H=7 actions, y_7=9.\n\nNow, check for collision at each step.\n\nAt each turn τ, position y_τ, check if on freeway and occupied.\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8.\n\ny_0=2: at τ=0, y=2, relative time 0.\n\nOccupancy: y=2 occupied only at τ=1? Earlier: y=2 occupied at t=1.\n\nAt τ=0, not occupied, so safe.\n\ny_1=3: at τ=1, y=3, freeway 3.\n\ny=3 occupied only at τ=1? From above, yes, at t=1.\n\nAt τ=1, on y=3, and occupied at τ=1, so collision! Oh.\n\ny=3 is occupied at relative time t=1.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at t=1 occupied, but here at τ=1, y_1=3.\n\nSo at turn τ=1, position y=3, and since y=3 is freeway, and occupied at time τ=1, collision.\n\nSo cannot be on y=3 at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up, at τ=1, I am on y=3, collide.\n\nIf I stay or something.\n\nBut in this path, collision.\n\nNow, also, at other points.\n\nFor example, later, y_4=6 at τ=4: y=6 occupied only at τ=0, so at τ=4 not occupied, safe.\n\ny_5=7 at τ=5: y=7 occupied at τ=7,8,9, τ=5<7, so not occupied, safe.\n\ny_6=8 at τ=6: y=8 occupied at τ=7,8,9,10, τ=6<7, not occupied, safe.\n\nBut the problem is at τ=1, on y=3, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I were on y=2 at τ=1, also collision, but I moved up.\n\nNow, to avoid collision at τ=1 on y=2 or y=3, I need not to be on y=2 or y=3 at τ=1.\n\ny=4 and y=5 also occupied at τ=1, so similarly.\n\ny=4 occupied at τ=1, y=5 at τ=1.\n\nOnly y=1,6,7,8 may be safe at τ=1, but y=1 occupied at τ=0, not at τ=1, y=6 occupied only at τ=0, not later, etc.\n\nAt τ=1, which freeways are occupied:\n\ny=1: occupied only τ=0, so at τ=1 not occupied\n\ny=2: occupied τ=1\n\ny=3: occupied τ=1\n\ny=4: occupied τ=1\n\ny=5: occupied τ=1\n\ny=6: occupied only τ=0, so at τ=1 not\n\ny=7: occupied τ=7,8,9, not at τ=1\n\ny=8: occupied τ=7-10, not at τ=1\n\nSo at τ=1, only y=1,6,7,8 are safe; y=2,3,4,5 are occupied.\n\nI need to not be on y=2,3,4,5 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=0, I am at y=2.\n\nI need to choose action at τ=0.\n\nIf I go U, to y=3 at τ=1, but y=3 occupied at τ=1, collision.\n\nIf I go S, stay at y=2, then at τ=1, y=2, occupied, collision.\n\nIf I go D, to y=1, then at τ=1, y=1.\n\ny=1 at τ=1: not occupied, since only occupied at τ=0, so safe.\n\nThen I can be at y=1 at τ=1.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up.\n\nBut y=1 is freeway, but safe at τ=1.\n\nNow, from y=1, I can go up to y=2, but y=2 at later times.\n\ny=2 occupied only at τ=1, so for τ>1, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nSince at τ=1, I must avoid y=2,3,4,5.\n\nOptions at τ=0: if I go D to y=1, then at τ=1, y=1, safe.\n\nIf I go S, stay y=2, collide at τ=1.\n\nIf I go U, to y=3, collide at τ=1.\n\nSo only choice is to go D to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nThen from there.\n\nNow at τ=1, y=1, safe.\n\nNow action at τ=1: I can go U to y=2, or S stay y=1, or D to y=0.\n\ny=0 is not freeway, always safe, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nIf I go U to y=2, at τ=2, y=2.\n\nNow, at τ=2, y=2: is it occupied?\n\ny=2 occupied only at τ=1, so at τ=2, not occupied, safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue up.\n\nBut let's see the whole path.\n\nFirst, at τ=0: action D, so Δy= -1, y_1 = y_0 + (-1) = 2-1=1\n\nAt τ=1: position y_1=1, action? Say U, then y_2 =1 +1=2\n\nAt τ=2: y_2=2, action U, y_3=3\n\nAt τ=3: y_3=3, action U, y_4=4\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut earlier with direct up, we had problem at τ=1, but now we are at y=1 at τ=1, safe.\n\nAt τ=2, y=2, not occupied, safe.\n\nAt τ=3, y=3: y=3 occupied only at τ=1, so at τ=3 not occupied, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=4 at τ=4, not occupied (only τ=1), safe.\n\ny=5 at τ=5, not occupied, safe.\n\nNow y=6 at τ=6: y=6 occupied only at τ=0, so at τ=6 not occupied, safe.\n\ny=7 at τ=7: y=7 occupied at τ=7,8,9.\n\nAt τ=7, occupied, so if I am on y=7 at τ=7, collision.\n\nProblem later.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 occupied at τ=7,8,9,10.\n\nIn this path, let's list positions:\n\nAssume actions from τ=1 onwards all U.\n\nAfter τ=0: D, y1=1\n\nτ=1: action a1, say U, y2=2\n\nτ=2: a2=U, y3=3\n\nτ=3: a3=U, y4=4\n\nτ=4: a4=U, y5=5\n\nτ=5: a5=U, y6=6\n\nτ=6: a6=U, y7=7\n\nAt τ=6, y6=6? Positions:\n\nAfter action at τ=5: y6=6? Let's:\n\nAt τ=0: y0=2\n\na0=D, y1=1\n\nAt τ=1: y1=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nAt τ=2: y2=2, a2=U, y3=3\n\nAt τ=3: y3=3, a3=U, y4=4\n\nAt τ=4: y4=4, a4=U, y5=5\n\nAt τ=5: y5=5, a5=U, y6=6\n\nAt τ=6: y6=6, a6=U, y7=7\n\nAt τ=7: y7=7, now at turn τ=7, position y=7.\n\ny=7 occupied at τ=7, so collision.\n\nIf I continue, a7=U, y8=8, but at τ=7, I am on y=7, collide.\n\nSo need to avoid being on y=7 at τ=7,8,9 or y=8 at τ=7,8,9,10.\n\nIn the above, at τ=6, y6=6, I am about to go to y=7 at τ=7.\n\nBut at τ=7, y=7 occupied.\n\nSo I need to not go to y=7 at τ=7.\n\nAt τ=6, I am at y=6.\n\nInstead of going U to y=7 at τ=7, I could stay or go down, but going down might not help.\n\nSince y=7 occupied from τ=7 to 9, I need to be on y=7 before τ=7 or after τ=9.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, occupied τ=7 to 10.\n\ny=7 safe for τ<=6 or τ>=10.\n\ny=8 safe for τ<=6 or τ>=11.\n\nBut τ=6 is early.\n\nAlso, I need to go through them.\n\nNow, back to the beginning.\n\nI have a problem at τ=1 and later at τ=7.\n\nFirst, handle τ=1.\n\nAs I did, at τ=0, go D to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nThen from y=1 at τ=1, I can go up.\n\nBut to save time, perhaps I can go up faster later, but min H=7 might not be possible.\n\nWith the detour down, I added one extra move, so y_1=1 instead of 3, so now at τ=1, y=1, whereas in min path I would be at y=3, so I am behind by 2? Let's see net.\n\nStart y0=2, after one down, y1=1, net down one, so to reach 9, I need to go up 8 instead of 7, so at least 8 actions if I go up all the way, but I can go faster later.\n\nH will be more than 7.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, from above, after going to y=1 at τ=1, now I need to go to y=9.\n\nNow at τ=1, y=1.\n\nI can go U to y=2 at τ=2.\n\ny=2 at τ=2: not occupied, safe.\n\nThen U to y=3 at τ=3, safe.\n\nU to y=4 at τ=4, safe.\n\nU to y=5 at τ=5, safe.\n\nU to y=6 at τ=6, safe.\n\nNow at τ=6, y=6.\n\nI need to go to y=7.\n\nBut if I go U at τ=6, y7=7 at τ=7, but y=7 occupied at τ=7, collision.\n\nIf I stay at y=6, S, then at τ=7, y=6? Action at τ=6: if S, then y7=6, position at τ=7 is y=6.\n\ny=6 is freeway, occupied only at τ=0, so at τ=7, not occupied, safe.\n\nBut I am still at y=6, not progressing.\n\nThen I need to go up later.\n\nBut y=7 occupied until τ=9, so at τ=9, if I am on y=7, occupied.\n\nAt τ=10, y=7 not occupied? y=7 occupied τ=7,8,9, so at τ=10, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 occupied τ=7,8,9,10, so at τ=11, not occupied.\n\nNow, at τ=6, I am at y=6.\n\nIf I stay at y=6 for some turns, then go up when safe.\n\nBut that will take more time.\n\nI could go up to y=7 before τ=7.\n\nBut τ=7 is the first occupied time for y=7.\n\nAt τ=6, I am at y=6.\n\nIf I go U at τ=6, I reach y=7 at τ=7, which is occupied.\n\nBut at τ=7, I am on y=7.\n\nTo be on y=7 before τ=7, but at τ=6, I can be on y=6 or lower, not y=7.\n\ny_τ is position at turn τ.\n\nAt τ=6, I can be at y=6 max if I came from below.\n\nFrom y=6 at τ=6, I cannot be at y=7 at τ=6; earliest is τ=7.\n\nSimilarly, after τ=9, I can be on y=7.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, since I need to go through both y=7 and y=8, and they are both occupied during overlapping times.\n\ny=7 safe for τ <=6 or τ >=10\n\ny=8 safe for τ <=6 or τ >=11\n\nBut at τ=6, I can be at y=6, not y=7.\n\nIf I can be at y=7 at τ=6, but I can't, since from below.\n\nThe only way to be on y=7 at τ=6 is if I was at y=6 at τ=5 and went U, but let's see the timeline.\n\nAt τ=5, position y_τ.\n\nIf at τ=5, y=6, and I go U, then at τ=6, y=7? No.\n\nAt turn τ, position y_τ.\n\nAfter action a_τ, y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy.\n\nSo at τ=5, y_5, after a_5, y_6 = y_5 + Δy_5.\n\nIf y_5=6 and a_5=U, then y_6=7.\n\nThen at τ=6, position y_6=7.\n\nNow, at τ=6, y=7: is it occupied?\n\ny=7 occupied at τ=7,8,9? τ=6 is before 7, so not occupied.\n\ny=7 occupied only at τ=7,8,9, so at τ=6, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=10, not occupied.\n\nBut at τ=7,8,9 occupied.\n\nSo at τ=6, on y=7, safe.\n\nThen I can stay or go up.\n\nBut at τ=6, y=7, if I go U to y=8 at τ=7.\n\nBut at τ=7, y=8: y=8 occupied at τ=7,8,9,10, so at τ=7 occupied, collision.\n\nIf I stay at y=7, at τ=7, y=7 occupied, collision.\n\nSo if I am on y=7 at τ=6, safe, but I cannot stay or go up at τ=6 without colliding later if I stay or go up immediately.\n\nAt τ=6, if y=7, safe.\n\nThen action at τ=6: if I go U, to y=8 at τ=7, then at τ=7, on y=8, occupied, collide.\n\nIf I go S, stay y=7, at τ=7, on y=7, occupied, collide.\n\nIf I go D, to y=6 at τ=7, then at τ=7, on y=6, which is safe, since only occupied at τ=0.\n\nThen I am at y=6 at τ=7, but I was at y=7 at τ=6, then down to y=6, so I wasted a move.\n\nThen I need to go up later.\n\nBut I can go to y=7 at τ=10, for example.\n\nBut let's think of a path.\n\nFirst, I need to handle the early part.\n\nI am at y=2 at τ=0.\n\nTo avoid collision at τ=1, I must go down to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nSo action at τ=0: D\n\nThen y1=1\n\nNow at τ=1, y=1, safe.\n\nNow, from here, I need to go up, but I have time before the late occupation.\n\nSince y=2,3,4,5 are safe after τ=1, only dangerous at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 safe except τ=0.\n\nSo I can go up directly to y=6 quickly.\n\nBut y=6 at τ= something.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1\n\nAction: U to y=2 at τ=2\n\nAt τ=2, y=2, safe (not occ at τ=2)\n\nAction U to y=3 at τ=3\n\nAt τ=3, y=3, safe\n\nAction U to y=4 at τ=4\n\ny=4 safe at τ=4\n\nAction U to y=5 at τ=5\n\ny=5 safe at τ=5\n\nAction U to y=6 at τ=6\n\ny=6 at τ=6: not occupied (only τ=0), safe.\n\nNow at τ=6, y=6.\n\nI need to go to y=7.\n\ny=7 occupied at τ=7,8,9\n\nSo I cannot be on y=7 at τ=7,8,9.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 occupied τ=7,8,9,10.\n\nSo I need to be on y=7 at τ<=6 or τ>=10.\n\nBut at τ=6, I can be at y=6 or lower, not y=7.\n\nIf I go U at τ=6, I am at y=7 at τ=7, which is occupied.\n\nNot good.\n\nI can stay at y=6 for some turns.\n\nFor example, at τ=6, y=6, action S, stay, then at τ=7, y=6, safe.\n\nThen I can stay or move.\n\nBut I need to go to y=7 eventually.\n\nThe next safe time for y=7 is τ=10.\n\nAt τ=10, y=7 not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at τ=11 not occupied.\n\nBut at τ=7, I am at y=6.\n\nIf I stay at y=6 until τ=9, for example.\n\nAt τ=7, y=6, action S, y7=6? Position at τ=7 is y=6 if I stayed.\n\nAction at τ=6: S, then y7=6 (position at τ=7)\n\nSimilarly, at τ=7, action S, y8=6\n\nAt τ=8, action S, y9=6\n\nAt τ=9, action U, y10=7\n\nThen at τ=10, y=7, position at τ=10.\n\nNow, at τ=10, y=7: not occupied, safe.\n\nThen action U to y=8 at τ=11.\n\nAt τ=11, y=8: y=8 occupied at τ=7,8,9,10, so at τ=11, not occupied (since τ=11>10), safe.\n\nThen action U to y=9 at τ=12.\n\nAt τ=12, y=9, goal.\n\nNow, H: from τ=0 to τ=11, actions at τ=0 to 11, 12 actions, y12=9.\n\nBut earlier we had y at τ=12.\n\nStarted at τ=0, after 12 actions, position at τ=12.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nSince I can go to y=7 at τ=10, but from y=6 at τ=9, I go U to y=7 at τ=10.\n\nIn the above, I stayed at y=6 from τ=6 to τ=9, that's 4 turns at y=6.\n\nτ=6 to τ=9: at τ=6,7,8,9 I am at y=6.\n\nThen at τ=9 action U, y10=7 at τ=10.\n\nThen at τ=10 action U, y11=8 at τ=11.\n\nThen at τ=11 action U, y12=9 at τ=12.\n\nBut at τ=11, y=8, which is safe only if not occupied, at τ=11 not occupied, yes.\n\nBut I reached at τ=12.\n\nBut I can go to y=7 earlier? No, because occupied.\n\nAnother idea: since y=8 is occupied from τ=7 to 10, and y=7 from 7 to 9, I can go directly to y=9 or something, but I have to go through y=7 and y=8.\n\ny=9 is not freeway, safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to be at y=8 and go U.\n\nI can be at y=7 at τ=6, but how?\n\nAt τ=5, if I am at y=6, and go U, then at τ=6, y=7.\n\nAt τ=6, y=7 not occupied, safe.\n\nThen at τ=6, I am at y=7.\n\nNow, I need to avoid being on y=7 at τ=7,8,9.\n\nSo at τ=6, after position y=7, I must leave y=7 before τ=7.\n\nBut at τ=6, I take action.\n\nIf I go U to y=8 at τ=7, but at τ=7, y=8 occupied, collision.\n\nIf I go S, stay y=7 at τ=7, collision.\n\nIf I go D to y=6 at τ=7, then at τ=7, on y=6, safe.\n\nThen I am back to y=6.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nI could go to y=8 before τ=7, but at τ=6, I can be at y=7, not y=8.\n\nTo be at y=8 at τ=6, I need to be at y=7 at τ=5 and go U, but let's see if possible.\n\nFrom start, I need to reach y=6 earlier.\n\nBut I was delayed by the initial down.\n\nAt τ=0, I went down to y=1.\n\nThen from y=1 at τ=1, I went up step by step to y=6 at τ=6.\n\ny_τ: τ=0:2, after a0=D, y1=1\n\nτ=1: y1=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nτ=2: y2=2, a2=U, y3=3\n\nτ=3: y3=3, a3=U, y4=4\n\nτ=4: y4=4, a4=U, y5=5\n\nτ=5: y5=5, a5=U, y6=6\n\nSo at τ=6, y6=6\n\nIf at τ=5, y5=5, I could go U to y6=6, same as above.\n\nTo be at y=6 earlier? τ=6 is the earliest I can be at y=6, since from y=2 down to y=1, then up.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, then after 5 ups, at τ=6, y=6.\n\nMinimal.\n\nAt τ=6, y=6, I can go U to y=7 at τ=7, but occupied.\n\nOr I can stay.\n\nBut to minimize H, I should go to y=7 as soon as safe, which is τ=10.\n\nBut τ=10 is late.\n\nSince y=7 is safe at τ=6, but I can't stay.\n\nAnother thought: I can go down to y=0 or something to wait, but that might take more time.\n\nFor example, at τ=6, y=6, instead of staying, I could go down to y=5, but then I have to come back, worse.\n\nSo better to stay at y=6.\n\nBut staying multiple turns.\n\nIn the sequence above, from τ=6 to τ=9, I stay at y=6 for 4 turns (τ=6,7,8,9 positions y=6, but actions at τ=6,7,8,9? Let's define.\n\nAt τ=6: position y6=6\n\nI need to set actions for τ=6 onwards.\n\nIf I do S at τ=6, then y7=6\n\nAt τ=7: position y7=6, do S, y8=6\n\nAt τ=8: y8=6, do S, y9=6\n\nAt τ=9: y9=6, do U, y10=7\n\nAt τ=10: y10=7, do U, y11=8\n\nAt τ=11: y11=8, do U, y12=9\n\nSo at τ=12, y12=9.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=11, 12 actions.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut I think I can do better by not staying so long.\n\nNotice that at τ=10, y=7 is safe, but y=8 is occupied until τ=10, so at τ=11 safe.\n\nBut I can be on y=8 at τ=6 if possible, but not.\n\nAnother idea: since the occupation is late, I can reach y=6 later and go up quickly after τ=9.\n\nBut I have to be at y=6 before going up.\n\nIn the early part, I went down to avoid τ=1, but I could go up to y=6 directly if possible, but y=6 is occupied at τ=0, but I am not on it then.\n\nAt τ=0, I am on y=2.\n\nIf I go U at τ=0, to y=3 at τ=1, but collide.\n\nIf I go S, stay y=2 at τ=1, collide.\n\nOnly D to y=1.\n\nSo I have to go down at first.\n\nPerhaps I can go down further or something, but not necessary.\n\nNow for the late part, instead of staying at y=6 from τ=6 to τ=9, I can go up to y=7 at τ=10, but I need to kill time.\n\nBut staying at one place is fine.\n\nI could move to other safe y, but all other y are safe except y=7 and y=8 during that time, but I am at y=6, which is safe.\n\nSo no better.\n\nBut let's check if I can be at y=7 at τ=10 with less delay.\n\nFor example, if I can reach y=6 later.\n\nBut from start, I am at y=1 at τ=1, then I need to go up to y=6, which takes 5 steps to from y=1 to y=6, so at τ=6, I am at y=6, fixed.\n\nThen from τ=6 to τ=9, I stay 4 turns, then to y=9 at τ=12.\n\nBut at τ=9, I go U to y=7 at τ=10.\n\nτ=10 is when y=7 is safe.\n\nBut y=8 at τ=11 safe.\n\nCan I go to y=7 at τ=10, then to y=8 at τ=11, to y=9 at τ=12.\n\nBut I need to be at y=6 at τ=9 to go U to y=7 at τ=10.\n\nAt τ=9, position y9, if y9=6, action U, y10=7.\n\nYes.\n\nBut to have y9=6, I need to be at y=6 from τ=6 to τ=9 with S actions.\n\nBut I can leave earlier, but if I go down, I have to come back, worse.\n\nSo min time is to stay at y=6 until τ=9.\n\nBut τ=9 action U to y10=7, τ=10 action U to y11=8, τ=11 action U to y12=9.\n\nNow, what about the action at τ=9? I go U, to y10=7.\n\nAt τ=10, I am on y=7, which is safe.\n\nThen U to y=8 at τ=11, safe.\n\nU to y=9 at τ=12.\n\nBut is there a way to save one turn?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=8 at τ=11 directly, but I have to go through y=7.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are both occupied, but at different times.\n\ny=7 safe at τ=10, y=8 safe at τ=11.\n\nSo I need to be on y=7 at τ=10, then y=8 at τ=11.\n\nCannot skip.\n\nPerhaps I can reach a higher y earlier, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother thought: at τ=6, I am at y=6.\n\nInstead of staying, I could go down to y=5 or something, but that would make it worse.\n\nFor example, go to y=5 at τ=7, then I need to go back up, more actions.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo H=12 seems necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nStart τ=0: position y0=2\n\nAction a0: D (to avoid collision at τ=1 on y=2)\n\nThen y1 = 2 + (-1) =1\n\nτ=1: position y1=1\n\nAction a1: U (go up)\n\ny2 =1 +1 =2\n\nτ=2: y2=2\n\nAction a2: U\n\ny3=3\n\nτ=3: y3=3\n\nAction a3: U\n\ny4=4\n\nτ=4: y4=4\n\nAction a4: U\n\ny5=5\n\nτ=5: y5=5\n\nAction a5: U\n\ny6=6\n\nτ=6: y6=6\n\nNow, to wait, action a6: S (stay)\n\ny7=6\n\nτ=7: y7=6\n\nAction a7: S\n\ny8=6\n\nτ=8: y8=6\n\nAction a8: S\n\ny9=6\n\nτ=9: y9=6\n\nAction a9: U\n\ny10=7\n\nτ=10: y10=7\n\nAction a10: U\n\ny11=8\n\nτ=11: y11=8\n\nAction a11: U\n\ny12=9\n\nNow at τ=12, y12=9, goal.\n\nCheck collisions:\n\nAt each τ, y_τ:\n\nτ=0: y=2, not occupied (occ only τ=1), safe\n\nτ=1: y=1, not occupied (occ only τ=0), safe\n\nτ=2: y=2, not occupied (only τ=1), safe\n\nτ=3: y=3, not occupied (only τ=1), safe\n\nτ=4: y=4, not occupied (only τ=1), safe\n\nτ=5: y=5, not occupied (only τ=1), safe\n\nτ=6: y=6, not occupied (only τ=0), safe\n\nτ=7: y=6, not occupied, safe\n\nτ=8: y=6, not occupied, safe\n\nτ=9: y=6, not occupied, safe\n\nτ=10: y=7, not occupied (occ τ=7-9, not τ=10), safe\n\nτ=11: y=8, not occupied (occ τ=7-10, not τ=11), safe\n\nτ=12: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nAll safe.\n\nH=12 actions, from τ=0 to τ=11.\n\nIn terms of turns, actions at t_1 + τ for τ=0 to 11.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, I think.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, from t=0 to H-1 relative.\n\nAfter H actions, position at τ=H.\n\nWe want y_H =9.\n\nHere y12=9, so H=12.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nPerhaps I can avoid going down at the beginning by staying or something, but at τ=1, I must not be on y=2,3,4,5.\n\nAt τ=0, I am on y=2.\n\nIf I go down to y=1, I avoid.\n\nIf I could go to y=6 directly, but I can't.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=0, I go S, but then at τ=1, y=2, occupied, collide.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo U, collide.\n\nOnly D.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=0.\n\nAt τ=0, action D, y1=1, as before.\n\nIf I go D again, to y=0 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nBut then I am at y=0, need to go up to y=9, even worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, the above seems necessary.\n\nBut for the late part, instead of staying at y=6, I could go to y=7 at τ=6, then immediately go down to y=6 at τ=7, but that doesn't save time.\n\nFor example, at τ=6, y=6, go U to y=7 at τ=7? Action at τ=6: if U, y7=7.\n\nThen at τ=7, position y7=7, which is occupied, collision.\n\nIf at τ=6 I go U, but at τ=6 position y=6, action U, y7=7.\n\nThen at τ=7, y=7, occupied, collide.\n\nIf I go to y=7 at τ=6, how?\n\nAt τ=5, if I am at y=6, but at τ=5, y5=5 in previous, I go U to y6=6 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, y=6.\n\nTo be at y=7 at τ=6, I need y6=7.\n\nBut from below, at τ=5, y5 must be 6 or 7.\n\nIf y5=6, go U, y6=7.\n\nBut at τ=5, I am at y=5, not 6.\n\nCan I reach y=6 at τ=5?\n\nAt τ=1, y=1\n\nThen if I go up every step: a1=U, y2=2 at τ=2\n\na2=U, y3=3 at τ=3\n\na3=U, y4=4 at τ=4\n\na4=U, y5=5 at τ=5\n\nCannot be at y=6 at τ=5; earliest is τ=6.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=7 at τ=6.\n\nThus, the only way is to stay at y=6 until τ=9, then go up.\n\nBut τ=9 to τ=10 y=7, τ=10 to τ=11 y=8, τ=11 to τ=12 y=9.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 at τ=11 directly from y=7 at τ=10.\n\nBut I need to be at y=7 at τ=10.\n\nNow, at τ=10, y=7, then to y=8 at τ=11.\n\nBut y=8 at τ=11 safe.\n\nNo shorter.\n\nAnother point: at τ=6, I am at y=6.\n\nI could go up to y=7 at τ=7, but collide.\n\nOr, I could go down to y=5 at τ=7, then stay or something, but that might allow me to go up later without staying, but since I have to reach y=7 after τ=9, it might not save time.\n\nFor example, at τ=6, y=6, action D, to y=7? No, D to y=5? Action D, Δy=-1, y7=6-1=5? y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy.\n\nAt τ=6, y6=6, action D, then y7=5\n\nPosition at τ=7 is y=5.\n\nThen I am at y=5 at τ=7.\n\nThen I need to go back up.\n\nBut y=5 is safe, but I have to go to y=6, then to y=7, etc.\n\nFor example, at τ=7, y=5, action U, y8=6\n\nτ=8: y=6, action U, y9=7? But at τ=9, if y=7, occupied, collision.\n\nIf I wait, at τ=8, y=6, action S, y9=6\n\nThen at τ=9, y=6, action U, y10=7, same as before.\n\nBut now I wasted actions going down and up.\n\nAt τ=6, I did D to y7=5 at τ=7\n\nThen at τ=7, U to y8=6 at τ=8\n\nThen at τ=8, S to y9=6? If S, y9=6\n\nThen U to y10=7, etc., same as before but with extra down and up, so worse.\n\nThus, not better.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 12 with the sequence as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have actions from τ=0 to τ=11.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output the actions starting from t_1.\n\nt_1=88.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 88: a_{88} = D\n\nTurn 89: a_{89} = U  (since τ=1, action a1=U)\n\nIn relative, τ=0: action at t_1 + 0 =88\n\nτ=1: t_1 +1=89\n\netc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 88: D\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U  (τ=2, a2=U)\n\nTurn 91: U  (τ=3)\n\nTurn 92: U  (τ=4)\n\nTurn 93: U  (τ=5)\n\nTurn 94: S  (τ=6, stay)\n\nTurn 95: S  (τ=7)\n\nTurn 96: S  (τ=8)\n\nTurn 97: S  (τ=9)  // at τ=9, action S? In my sequence, at τ=9, position y9=6, and action a9=U to y10=7\n\nList the actions and positions clearly.\n\nDefine:\n\nTurn (absolute) | position at start of turn | action | new position after action\n\nBut collision is at the turn, based on position at that turn.\n\nIn the game, at each turn T, you are at position y_T, then you take action a_T, then move to y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at T based on y_T.\n\nFor turn T=88: position y=2, action a_T, then y_{89} = y + Δy\n\nThen at T=89, position y= y_{89}, and so on.\n\nIn terms:\n\nAt T=88: pos=2, action a88, then new pos = 2 + Δy\n\nAfter action, pos for T+1.\n\nFor T=88: pos=2, after a88, pos for T=89 is 2 + Δy\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow collision at T: based on pos at T, which is before action.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nT=88: pos=2, which is safe (not occ), action: D, so new pos for T=89: 2-1=1\n\nT=89: pos=1, safe (not occ at τ=1), action: U, new pos T=90:1+1=2\n\nT=90: pos=2, safe (τ=2, not occ), action: U, new pos T=91:3\n\nT=91: pos=3, safe, action: U, new pos T=92:4\n\nT=92: pos=4, safe, action: U, new pos T=93:5\n\nT=93: pos=5, safe, action: U, new pos T=94:6\n\nT=94: pos=6, safe, action: S (stay), new pos T=95:6\n\nT=95: pos=6, safe, action: S, new pos T=96:6\n\nT=96: pos=6, safe, action: S, new pos T=97:6\n\nT=97: pos=6, safe, action: U, new pos T=98:7\n\nT=98: pos=7, now T=98, absolute, relative τ= T - 88.\n\nT=98, τ=10.\n\npos=7, at τ=10, not occupied, safe.\n\naction: U, new pos T=99:8\n\nT=99: pos=8, τ=11, not occupied (y=8 occ τ=7-10, not 11), safe.\n\naction: U, new pos T=100:9\n\nNow at T=100, position=9, which is goal.\n\nWe have actions from T=88 to T=99, that's 12 actions? T=88 to T=99 inclusive: 88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99: that's 12 turns.\n\nAfter action at T=99, position at T=100 is 9.\n\nSo we reached at T=100.\n\nH=12, actions at t=88 to 99.\n\nIn the sequence, last action at T=99.\n\nNow, to output.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nHere H=12, so actions at t=88 to 88+11=99.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, write the actions:\n\nTurn 88: D\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nTurn 93: U\n\nTurn 94: S\n\nTurn 95: S\n\nTurn 96: S\n\nTurn 97: S\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nAt T=97: action U, to pos T=98=7\n\nThen T=98: action U, to pos T=99=8\n\nT=99: action U, to pos T=100=9\n\nIn the action list, at T=97: action is U, but position at T=97 is 6, action U to next.\n\nIn the output, it's the action at each turn.\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=97, action U.\n\nThen at T=98, action U.\n\nT=99, action U.\n\nBut at T=98 and T=99, we have actions, but position at T=98 is 7, which we go U to 8, and T=99 pos=8 U to 9.\n\nNow, in the stay part, from T=94 to T=97, actions S, but at T=97, we do U.\n\nT=94: S, T=95: S, T=96: S, T=97: U\n\nThen T=98: U, T=99: U\n\nNow, is there a way to have H smaller?\n\nFor example, if I can reduce the stay.\n\nNotice that y=7 is safe at τ=10, but I reach it at τ=10.\n\ny=8 safe at τ=11.\n\nBut to reach y=7 at τ=10, I need to be at y=6 at τ=9.\n\nBut at τ=6, I am at y=6, and I stay until τ=9.\n\nτ=6 to τ=9 is 4 turns: τ=6,7,8,9 positions at y=6, with actions at τ=6,7,8: S, and at τ=9: U to y=7 at τ=10.\n\nActions: at τ=6,7,8: S, τ=9: U.\n\nThat's three S actions and one U at τ=9.\n\nIn terms of time, from τ=6 to τ=9, I have four actions but only one move.\n\nBut necessary.\n\nPerhaps I can be at a different y during the waiting period, but no benefit.\n\nAnother idea: since y=0 and y=9 are safe, I could go to y=0 and wait, but that is lower, worse.\n\nOr go to y=9 directly, but I have to go through y=8.\n\nNo.\n\nThus, H=12 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can go to y=7 at τ=6.\n\nImpossible.\n\nPerhaps with the initial, but I think not.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 88: & D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 89: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 90: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 91: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 92: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 93: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 94: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 95: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 96: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 97: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 98: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 99: & U \\end{array} }\n\nIn this, at Turn 97: U, which is from y=6 to y=7 at T=98.\n\nThen Turn 98: U, to y=8 at T=99.\n\nTurn 99: U, to y=9 at T=100.\n\nAnd positions: at T=94,95,96,97: all position 6? At T=97: position is 6, action U, to 7 at T=98.\n\nIn the action list, Turn 97: U is correct.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the stay, Turn 94: S (stay at 6), Turn 95: S (stay), Turn 96: S (stay), then Turn 97: U (up to 7).\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's the minimal.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 88\\) is 12. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by moving down to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 88 to avoid the collision on \\(y = 2\\) at turn 89 (relative time \\(\\tau = 1\\)), and then staying at \\(y = 6\\) from turns 94 to 97 to avoid collisions on \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) during the dangerous periods (\\(\\tau = 7\\) to \\(\\tau = 9\\) for \\(y = 7\\), and \\(\\tau = 7\\) to \\(\\tau = 10\\) for \\(y = 8\\)).\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- At turn 88, move down (D) to avoid being on \\(y = 2\\) at turn 89 when it is occupied.\n- From turns 89 to 93, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 6\\) by turn 94.\n- From turns 94 to 96, stay (S) at \\(y = 6\\) to wait until the dangerous periods for \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) pass.\n- At turn 97, move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\), which is safe at relative time \\(\\tau = 10\\) (turn 98).\n- At turn 98, move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\), which is safe at relative time \\(\\tau = 11\\) (turn 99).\n- At turn 99, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 100.\n\nThe sequence ensures no collisions:\n- At turn 88 (\\(\\tau = 0\\)): on \\(y = 2\\), not occupied.\n- At turn 89 (\\(\\tau = 1\\)): on \\(y = 1\\), not occupied.\n- At turns 90 to 93 (\\(\\tau = 2\\) to \\(\\tau = 5\\)): on \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 5\\), not occupied except at \\(\\tau = 1\\).\n- At turns 94 to 97 (\\(\\tau = 6\\) to \\(\\tau = 9\\)): on \\(y = 6\\), not occupied except at \\(\\tau = 0\\).\n- At turn 98 (\\(\\tau = 10\\)): on \\(y = 7\\), not occupied (safe after \\(\\tau = 9\\)).\n- At turn 99 (\\(\\tau = 11\\)): on \\(y = 8\\), not occupied (safe after \\(\\tau = 10\\)).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 88: & D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 89: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 90: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 91: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 92: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 93: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 94: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 95: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 96: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 97: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 98: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 99: & U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 90, and the player is at (0,2). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position y is in [0,9]. We start at y=2 and want to get to y=9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8) and at that same turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nImportant: When the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is still on y_T. Then at turn T+1, the player is on y_{T+1}. So at turn T, we only check the freeway y_T for collisions.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1=90. For future turns T (T>=90), we can compute the car spans using the update rules.\n\nWe are to find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) for turns 90, 91, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nLet me note the car information for each freeway (k from 1 to 8). Each freeway has a list of cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=96, tail=49, direction=right, speed=48)\nFreeway 2: two cars: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12)\nFreeway 3: two cars: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12) [same as freeway 2?]\nFreeway 4: one car: (-60,-25,left,36)\nFreeway 5: one car: (-60,-25,left,36) [same as freeway 4?]\nFreeway 6: one car: (18,7,right,6)\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-20,-31,right,4) and (44,33,right,4)\nFreeway 8: one car: (-15,-26,right,3)\n\nNote: For left-moving cars, the head is the rightmost point? Actually, the update rule for left-moving: \n  Initially at t1: [h, tau] (which is [head, tail]?) and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\nFor right-moving: [tau, head]? Actually the update rule says for right-moving: [tau, head] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the table, the cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). So we need to interpret:\n\nFor a right-moving car: the car moves to the right. The tail is the left end and head is the right end? Actually, the update rule for right-moving says:\n  Initial span: [tau, head] -> then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the input, for a right-moving car, the first number is head and second is tail. But according to the update rule for right-moving, the initial span is [tail, head]? \n\nWait, the update rule says:\n  Right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" -> then [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo the initial span at t1 is [tau, h] meaning from tau to h (so tau is left, h is right). But in the table, for freeway 1: (head=96, tail=49, right, 48). So if we interpret as [tail, head] = [49,96] at t1=90.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: the update rule says \"Span(t1)= [h, tau]\" -> then [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So [h, tau] meaning from h to tau? But which is left and right? Since it moves left, h should be the right end and tau the left? Actually, the update rule subtracts, so the entire car moves left. So at t1, the car is from h to tau? But note: h and tau, and the direction of movement.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's define for each car the initial span at t1=90:\n\nFor a car with (head, tail, direction, speed):\n  If direction is right: the car occupies [tail, head] at t1 (because the update rule for right uses [tau, h] and we have tail as tau and head as h?).\n  If direction is left: the car occupies [tau, head] at t1? But wait the update rule for left uses [h, tau]. \n\nActually, the problem states for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\". And in the input, the car is given as (head, tail, ...). So for left-moving, we have head = h, tail = tau? Then the span at t1 is [head, tail]? But note: [head, tail] might be backwards if head > tail? \n\nLooking at freeway 4: (-60,-25,left,36). Here head=-60, tail=-25. But -60 < -25, so [head, tail] = [-60, -25] is from -60 to -25? But that would be increasing? Actually, the update rule for left moves the entire car to the left. So if at t1 the car is from -60 to -25, then after moving left by s*(T-t1), it becomes [-60 - s*(T-t1), -25 - s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for a right-moving car: (head, tail) = (96,49) -> [tail, head] = [49,96] at t1? But the update rule says for right: \"Span(t1)= [tau, h]\" and then moves to [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So if we have (head, tail) and direction right, then we set tau = tail and h = head? So the initial span is [tail, head] and then moves right.\n\nBut in the input, for freeway 1: tail=49, head=96, so [49,96] at t1=90.\n\nNow, the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (which is y_T = k) and there exists a car on freeway k such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway and each car, the span at turn T (for T>=90).\n\nLet dt = T - 90.\n\nFor a right-moving car: span at T = [tail + s*dt, head + s*dt]\nFor a left-moving car: span at T = [head - s*dt, tail - s*dt]\n\nBut note: for left-moving, the input gives (head, tail) and the update uses [h, tau] -> [h-s*dt, tau-s*dt]. So we use head as h and tail as tau.\n\nSo:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: tail=49, head=96, s=48, right -> span at T: [49 + 48*dt, 96 + 48*dt]\n\nFreeway 2: \n  Car1: (head=60, tail=49, right,12) -> [49+12*dt, 60+12*dt]? But wait, the input says (60,49,right,12). So head=60, tail=49? Then [49+12*dt, 60+12*dt]\n  Car2: (12,1,right,12) -> [1+12*dt, 12+12*dt]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? \n  Car1: (60,49,right,12) -> [49+12*dt, 60+12*dt]\n  Car2: (12,1,right,12) -> [1+12*dt,12+12*dt]\n\nFreeway 4: (-60,-25,left,36) -> [head - 36*dt, tail - 36*dt] = [-60 -36*dt, -25 -36*dt]\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4: [-60-36*dt, -25-36*dt]\n\nFreeway 6: (18,7,right,6) -> [7+6*dt, 18+6*dt]\n\nFreeway 7:\n  Car1: (-20,-31,right,4) -> [-31+4*dt, -20+4*dt]\n  Car2: (44,33,right,4) -> [33+4*dt,44+4*dt]\n\nFreeway 8: (-15,-26,right,3) -> [-26+3*dt, -15+3*dt]\n\nNow, we are at turn 90, y=2. We cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions to get to y=9 as quickly as possible, avoiding collisions.\n\nSince we can only move one step at a time, the minimal number of moves in terms of vertical steps is 7 (from 2 to 9: 7 ups). But we might have to wait (use S) to avoid cars.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k at turn T if at that turn T, any car on freeway k has a span that includes 0.\n\nWe are at y=2 at turn 90. We are about to take an action at turn 90 that will determine y91.\n\nLet me denote the state as (turn, y). We start at (90,2).\n\nWe want to simulate the path. We are to find the minimal H (number of turns) to reach y=9.\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over states (turn, y) but note that turn can be large? However, we can bound the number of turns because the cars are moving and eventually the cars will pass 0 and we can always wait. But we want minimal turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can simulate turn by turn and check for collisions.\n\nWe need to check for each freeway we are on at a given turn, whether 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nWe start at turn 90, y=2. Since y=2 is freeway 2? Actually, freeways are y=1 to 8. The player is at (0,y). At turn 90, we are at freeway 2? Actually, no: the player is at (0,2), so that freeway is 2.\n\nBut note: at turn 90, we are at y=2. We are about to take action at turn 90. The collision condition at turn 90: we are on freeway 2 at turn 90. So we must check freeway 2 at turn 90 (dt=0).\n\nFreeway 2 at dt=0:\n  Car1: [49+0, 60+0] = [49,60] -> 0 is not in [49,60]\n  Car2: [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12]\nSo safe at turn 90.\n\nNow, we can choose action at turn 90: U, D, or S.\n\nWe want to minimize H, so we prefer U. But we have to avoid collisions in the future.\n\nLet me try to go up as much as possible, but check at each step.\n\nPlan 1: Always go up until we hit 9.\n\nStart at turn90: y=2 -> action U -> turn91: y=3.\n\nAt turn91: we are on freeway 3? (since y=3) -> check freeway3 at T=91 (dt=1).\n\nFreeway3 at dt=1:\n  Car1: [49+12*1, 60+12*1] = [61,72] -> 0 not in [61,72]\n  Car2: [1+12*1,12+12*1] = [13,24] -> 0 not in [13,24]\nSafe.\n\nAction at turn91: U -> turn92: y=4.\n\nAt turn92: freeway4, T=92 (dt=2).\nFreeway4: car: [-60-36*2, -25-36*2] = [-60-72, -25-72] = [-132,-97] -> 0 not in this interval? (since -132 to -97 is negative) -> safe.\n\nAction at turn92: U -> turn93: y=5.\n\nAt turn93: freeway5, T=93 (dt=3).\nFreeway5: same as freeway4? car: [-60-36*3, -25-36*3] = [-60-108, -25-108] = [-168, -133] -> safe.\n\nAction at turn93: U -> turn94: y=6.\n\nAt turn94: freeway6, T=94 (dt=4).\nFreeway6: [7+6*4, 18+6*4] = [7+24,18+24] = [31,42] -> safe.\n\nAction at turn94: U -> turn95: y=7.\n\nAt turn95: freeway7, T=95 (dt=5).\nFreeway7 has two cars:\n  Car1: [-31+4*5, -20+4*5] = [-31+20, -20+20] = [-11,0]\n  Car2: [33+4*5,44+4*5] = [33+20,44+20] = [53,64]\n\nCar1: [-11,0] -> note: the interval is [-11,0]. Since it's a continuous span? The collision condition: 0 is included? Yes, 0 is the right endpoint.\n\nThe problem says: collision if 0 is in the span. The span is [a,b] meaning from a to b, inclusive? Since 0 is the endpoint, it is included.\n\nSo at turn95, freeway7: car1 has span [-11,0] which includes 0. So if we are at freeway7 at turn95, we collide.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at freeway7 at turn95.\n\nSo our plan to go straight up fails at turn95.\n\nWe need to avoid being on freeway7 at turn95.\n\nWe have a few options:\n- At turn94 (y=6) we don't go up to 7, but stay or go down? But we want to go up eventually.\n- We can delay the move to freeway7 by one turn: at turn94, instead of going up, we stay at y=6 for one turn, then go up at turn95 to y=7 at turn96.\n\nBut note: at turn94 we are at y=6. We take action at turn94: if we take S, then at turn95 we are still at y=6? Then at turn95 we take U to go to y=7 at turn96.\n\nBut at turn95, we are at y=6 (freeway6). We must check freeway6 at turn95 (dt=5).\n\nFreeway6 at dt=5: [7+6*5, 18+6*5] = [7+30,18+30]=[37,48] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn95, we take U to go to y=7 at turn96.\n\nNow at turn96: we are at freeway7? (y=7) -> check freeway7 at T=96 (dt=6).\n\nFreeway7:\n  Car1: [-31+4*6, -20+4*6] = [-31+24, -20+24] = [-7,4]\n  Car2: [33+24,44+24]=[57,68]\n\nCar1: [-7,4] -> includes 0? Yes, because -7<0<4. So collision at turn96.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nWe could wait two turns at y=6? Then go up at turn96 to y=7 at turn97.\n\nAt turn94: at y=6, take S -> turn95: y=6 (freeway6 at dt=5: safe as above [37,48])\nAt turn95: take S again -> turn96: y=6 (freeway6 at dt=6: [7+36,18+36]=[43,54] -> safe)\nAt turn96: take U -> turn97: y=7 (freeway7 at dt=7)\n\nFreeway7 at dt=7:\n  Car1: [-31+4*7, -20+4*7] = [-31+28, -20+28] = [-3,8] -> includes 0? Yes, -3<=0<=8 -> collision.\n\nStill not safe.\n\nWait three turns? Then at turn97: take U -> turn98: y=7 (freeway7 at dt=8)\n\nCar1: [-31+32, -20+32] = [1,12] -> does not include 0? 1 to 12, 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nCar2: [33+28,44+28]=[61,72] -> safe.\n\nSo if we wait at y=6 for three turns (from turn94 to turn96: three S actions) then at turn97 we go U to y=7 at turn98.\n\nThen we can proceed:\n\nAt turn97: we are at y=6 -> action U -> turn98: y=7.\n\nNow at turn98: freeway7 at dt=8 -> as above, safe.\n\nThen we can go up from there.\n\nBut we are not at 9 yet. We need to go from 7 to 8 to 9.\n\nAt turn98: y=7 -> action U -> turn99: y=8 (freeway8)\n\nCheck freeway8 at turn99 (dt=9):\n  Car: [-26+3*9, -15+3*9] = [-26+27, -15+27] = [1,12] -> does not include 0? safe.\n\nThen at turn99: action U -> turn100: y=9 -> we reached the goal.\n\nBut note: at y=9, we are not on any freeway (freeways are 1-8), so no collision check.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn90: U -> y=3 at turn91\nTurn91: U -> y=4 at turn92\nTurn92: U -> y=5 at turn93\nTurn93: U -> y=6 at turn94\nTurn94: S -> still y=6 at turn95\nTurn95: S -> y=6 at turn96\nTurn96: S -> y=6 at turn97\nTurn97: U -> y=7 at turn98\nTurn98: U -> y=8 at turn99\nTurn99: U -> y=9 at turn100\n\nTotal turns: 10 (from turn90 to turn99: 10 actions? Actually, we take 10 actions: 90 to 99, and at turn100 we are at y=9, so we stop after the 10th action? The sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, and we end at turn90+H-1.\n\nWe start at turn90: we take an action at turn90, then 91, ... until the turn where we first reach y=9.\n\nIn this case, we reach y=9 at turn100. The last action is at turn99. So H=10.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nWe must avoid freeway7 at the dangerous times: turn95,96,97 are dangerous? Actually, at dt=5,6,7: \n  dt=5: car1 on freeway7: [-11,0] -> dangerous at turn95 (dt=5)\n  dt=6: [-7,4] -> dangerous at turn96 (dt=6)\n  dt=7: [-3,8] -> dangerous at turn97 (dt=7)\n  dt=8: [1,12] -> safe at turn98 (dt=8)\n\nSo we can only be on freeway7 at or after dt=8.\n\nBut we are at y=6 at turn94 (dt=4). We need to get to y=7. The earliest safe turn for freeway7 is turn98 (dt=8). So we must be at y=7 at turn98.\n\nFrom turn94 (y=6) we can only move at turn94,95,96,97: four actions. We need to be at y=6 until turn97 and then move to y=7 at turn98? So we must take three S at y=6 and then U at turn97.\n\nBut what if we go down and then up? That would take more moves. So the above seems minimal.\n\nBut can we avoid waiting that long by taking a different path?\n\nAlternative: at some point we go down to avoid a collision and then go up? But that would take more moves.\n\nAnother alternative: skip freeway7 by going from freeway6 to freeway8 in one move? But we can only move one step per turn. So we cannot skip.\n\nWe must go through freeway7.\n\nBut note: we can go from y=6 to y=7 to y=8, but we have to avoid freeway7 at dangerous times.\n\nWe could go to freeway7 earlier? For example, if we can get to freeway7 at a safe time before dt=5? \n\nWe started at turn90 at y=2. We went to y=3 at turn91, y4 at 92, y5 at93, y6 at94. So we are at y6 at turn94 (dt=4). Then if we go to y7 at turn95 (dt=5) -> which is dangerous.\n\nCan we get to freeway7 earlier? \n\nSuppose we go up faster? But we are going as fast as possible: we did U every turn until turn94.\n\nWe started at y2. To get to y7, we need 5 moves (2->3,3->4,4->5,5->6,6->7). So the earliest we can be at y7 is turn95 (if we start at turn90: 90->91->92->93->94->95: 5 moves). But turn95 is dangerous.\n\nThe next safe time for freeway7 is turn98 (dt=8). So we must be at y7 at turn98. That means we have to wait at some lower freeway for 3 turns.\n\nBut where? We are at y6 at turn94. We can wait at y6 for 3 turns (turn94,95,96) and then move to y7 at turn97? But then at turn97 we are at y7? Then we would be at freeway7 at turn97 (dt=7) which is dangerous. \n\nWe must be at y7 at turn98. So we need to be at y6 at turn97, then move to y7 at turn98.\n\nSo the waiting must be at y6: from turn94 to turn97 (three S actions) then U at turn97 to get to y7 at turn98.\n\nThen we go to y8 at turn99 and y9 at turn100.\n\nBut what about freeway8? We have to check freeway8 at the turn we are on it.\n\nAt turn99: we are at freeway8 (y=8) at dt=9.\n\nFreeway8: car: [-26+3*9, -15+3*9] = [-26+27, -15+27] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn90: U (y becomes 3 at turn91)\nTurn91: U (y=4 at turn92)\nTurn92: U (y=5 at turn93)\nTurn93: U (y=6 at turn94)\nTurn94: S (y=6 at turn95)  [freeway6 at dt=5: [37,48] safe]\nTurn95: S (y=6 at turn96)  [freeway6 at dt=6: [43,54] safe]\nTurn96: S (y=6 at turn97)  [freeway6 at dt=7: [49,60] safe]\nTurn97: U (y=7 at turn98)  [freeway7 at dt=8: [1,12] for car1? Actually above we computed car1 at dt=8: [1,12] and car2 at [61,72] -> safe]\nTurn98: U (y=8 at turn99)  [freeway8 at dt=9: [1,12] safe]\nTurn99: U (y=9 at turn100) -> goal.\n\nTotal actions: 10.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in less than 10?\n\nWe must make at least 7 moves (from 2 to 9). And we had to wait 3 turns. So 10 is minimal? But maybe we can wait at a different freeway?\n\nFor example, if we wait at y=5 instead of y=6? Then we would have to move up later, and we still have to pass freeway7 at a safe time.\n\nSuppose we do:\n\nTurn90: U -> y3\nTurn91: U -> y4\nTurn92: U -> y5\nThen wait at y5 for a few turns? Then go to y6 and then y7 at a safe time.\n\nBut we have to avoid freeway5? At freeway5, we have a car: [-60-36*dt, -25-36*dt]. This car is moving left and is always negative? So it's safe at freeway5 at any time? \n\nBut we also have to consider the freeway we are on at each turn.\n\nAt turn93: we are at y5 (freeway5) at dt=3: [-60-108, -25-108]=[-168,-133] -> safe.\n\nIf we wait at y5 for k turns, then at turn93+k: we are at freeway5 at dt=3+k: [-60-36*(3+k), -25-36*(3+k)] = negative and getting more negative -> safe.\n\nThen we can go up to y6 at turn93+k+1, and then to y7 at turn93+k+2.\n\nWe need to be at y7 at a safe time: the earliest safe is turn98 (dt=8). \n\nSo we need: \n  At turn93+k+2: we are at y7, and that turn must be >=98? \n  So 93 + k + 2 >= 98 -> 95 + k >= 98 -> k>=3.\n\nSo we would wait at y5 for 3 turns: \n  turn93: at y5, take S -> turn94: y5\n  turn94: S -> turn95: y5\n  turn95: S -> turn96: y5\n  turn96: U -> turn97: y6\n  turn97: U -> turn98: y7 (which is safe)\n\nThen:\n  turn98: U -> turn99: y8\n  turn99: U -> turn100: y9\n\nBut we have to check freeway6 at turn97: when we are at y6 at turn97 (dt=7: T=97 -> dt=7) -> freeway6: [7+6*7,18+6*7]=[7+42,18+42]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\nAnd freeway8 at turn99: as before [1,12] safe.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nTurn90: U -> y3\nTurn91: U -> y4\nTurn92: U -> y5\nTurn93: S -> y5 (wait)\nTurn94: S -> y5\nTurn95: S -> y5\nTurn96: U -> y6\nTurn97: U -> y7\nTurn98: U -> y8\nTurn99: U -> y9\n\nTotal 10 moves.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut we can also wait at y4? \n\nAt freeway4: the car is moving left and is always negative? So safe.\n\nWe start at y2, then:\n\nTurn90: U -> y3\nTurn91: U -> y4\nThen wait at y4 for k turns? Then go to y5, y6, y7.\n\nWe need to be at y7 at turn98 (dt=8).\n\nLet t be the turn when we leave y4: we go to y5 at turn t.\n\nThen we go to y6 at t+1, and y7 at t+2.\n\nWe require t+2 = 98 -> t=96.\n\nSo we leave y4 at turn96.\n\nThat means we are at y4 from turn91 to turn96? \n\nAt turn91: we are at y4 (after the U from y3 at turn91).\n\nThen we take S at turn91,92,93,94,95: that's 5 S actions? Then at turn96: we take U to go to y5 at turn97? \n\nBut we need to be at y7 at turn98. Then:\n\nTurn96: U (from y4 to y5) at turn97: y5\nTurn97: U -> y6 at turn98\nTurn98: U -> y7 at turn99 -> but that's too late? We wanted to be at y7 at turn98? \n\nMistake: we are at y4 at turn91. Then we take actions:\n\nTurn91: we are at y4 -> we take S -> so at turn92: still y4.\nTurn92: S -> turn93: y4\nTurn93: S -> turn94: y4\nTurn94: S -> turn95: y4\nTurn95: S -> turn96: y4\nTurn96: U -> turn97: y5\nTurn97: U -> turn98: y6\nTurn98: U -> turn99: y7 -> but then we are at y7 at turn99 (dt=9) -> check freeway7 at dt=9: \n  Car1: [-31+4*9, -20+4*9] = [-31+36, -20+36] = [5,16] -> safe? but we are at y7 at turn99, which is safe? \nThen we can go to y8 at turn100 and y9 at turn101.\n\nBut this takes 11 moves.\n\nAlternatively, we leave earlier? We need to be at y7 at turn98. \n\nIf we are at y4 at turn t, then we need to do three moves (to y5, y6, y7) which takes 3 turns. So we must leave y4 at turn95: then turn95: U -> turn96: y5; turn96: U -> turn97: y6; turn97: U -> turn98: y7.\n\nSo we are at y4 from turn91 to turn95? \n\nAt turn91: y4\nThen we take S at turn91,92,93,94 -> four S actions? Then at turn95: we take U to go to y5 at turn96.\n\nBut then:\nTurn95: U -> turn96: y5\nTurn96: U -> turn97: y6\nTurn97: U -> turn98: y7 -> which is safe.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nTurn90: U -> y3 at91\nTurn91: S -> y4 at92? But wait: at turn91 we are at y4? Then we take action at turn91: if we take S, then at turn92 we are still at y4.\n\nBut we are at y4 at turn91 (after the first U at turn90 and U at turn91? Let me list the turns:\n\nTurn90: action U -> at the end of turn90, we are at y3? Actually, the update: at turn t, we take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta.\n\nSo:\n  Turn90: start at y=2, take action a90 -> then at turn91, y91 = y90 + Delta90.\n  So if a90=U, then at turn91: y91=3.\n\nSimilarly, at turn91: we take action a91 -> then at turn92: y92 = y91 + Delta91.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn90: U -> at turn91: y=3\nTurn91: U -> at turn92: y=4\nThen at turn92: we are at y4.\n\nWe want to be at y4 from turn92 to turn95? \n\nAt turn92: we are at y4. We then take S at turn92,93,94 -> three S actions? Then at turn95: we take U -> then at turn96: y5.\n\nBut we need to be at y7 at turn98.\n\nThen:\n  Turn96: y5 -> take U at turn96 -> turn97: y6\n  Turn97: U -> turn98: y7 -> safe.\n\nBut we are at freeway5 at turn96? Check: T=96, dt=6 -> freeway5: [-60-36*6, -25-36*6] = [-60-216, -25-216] = [-276,-241] -> safe.\n\nFreeway6 at turn97: T=97, dt=7: [7+6*7,18+6*7]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn90: U -> y3 at91\nTurn91: U -> y4 at92\nTurn92: S -> y4 at93\nTurn93: S -> y4 at94\nTurn94: S -> y4 at95\nTurn95: U -> y5 at96\nTurn96: U -> y6 at97\nTurn97: U -> y7 at98\nTurn98: U -> y8 at99\nTurn99: U -> y9 at100\n\nTotal 10 moves.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut we can try to combine with moving down? For example, if we go to y5 and then down to y4? That would be longer.\n\nIs there a way to do 9 moves? We must make 7 moves up. Then we can have at most 2 waits. But we need to avoid freeway7 from turn95 to turn97 (inclusive). We must not be on freeway7 at turns95,96,97. We can be on freeway7 at turn98.\n\nThe earliest we can be at freeway7 is turn95 (if we go up without waiting). Then we would have to skip turn95,96,97. So we have to be at freeway7 at turn98.\n\nTo get to freeway7 at turn98, we must be at freeway6 at turn97. And to be at freeway6 at turn97, we must have been at freeway5 at turn96, and so on.\n\nWe are at freeway2 at turn90. We can get to freeway3 at turn91, freeway4 at92, freeway5 at93, freeway6 at94. Then we are at freeway6 at turn94. Then we have to get to freeway6 at turn97? So we must wait at freeway6 for 3 turns: turn94,95,96. Then at turn97 we go to freeway7? But then we are at freeway7 at turn98? No: if we are at freeway6 at turn97 and take U at turn97, then at turn98 we are at freeway7.\n\nSo we must be at freeway6 at turn97. We were at freeway6 at turn94. So we need to stay at freeway6 for turns 94,95,96,97? That's three waits: at turn94,95,96 we take S, then at turn97 we take U to go to freeway7 at turn98.\n\nBut then we have used:\n\nTurn90: U -> freeway3 at91\nTurn91: U -> freeway4 at92\nTurn92: U -> freeway5 at93\nTurn93: U -> freeway6 at94\nThen turn94: S -> freeway6 at95\nTurn95: S -> freeway6 at96\nTurn96: S -> freeway6 at97\nTurn97: U -> freeway7 at98\nTurn98: U -> freeway8 at99\nTurn99: U -> y9 at100\n\nThat's 10 moves.\n\nBut note: we are at freeway6 at turn94,95,96,97. We have to check for collisions at freeway6 at these turns.\n\nWe computed earlier for freeway6:\n  dt=4 (T=94): [7+24,18+24]=[31,42] -> safe\n  dt=5 (T=95): [37,48] -> safe\n  dt=6 (T=96): [43,54] -> safe\n  dt=7 (T=97): [49,60] -> safe\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nBut we are using 10 moves. Can we avoid one wait?\n\nSuppose we try to get to freeway7 at turn98 without waiting three times? But we have to be at freeway6 at turn97. And we get to freeway6 at turn94. So we have to cover turns94,95,96,97 at freeway6? But we can leave freeway6 earlier? But if we leave freeway6 earlier, then we go to freeway7 earlier, which is dangerous.\n\nWhat if we go to freeway7 at turn94? But we cannot: we are at freeway6 at turn94, we can go to freeway7 at turn95? But that's dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, we could go down to freeway5 at some point? But that would require extra moves.\n\nFor example, at turn94: we are at freeway6. Instead of staying, we go down to freeway5 at turn95? Then we are at freeway5 at turn95 (dt=5): safe? Then we can go back up? But that would add moves.\n\nFor instance:\n\nTurn94: at freeway6, we take D -> then at turn95: y5 (freeway5) -> safe (freeway5 is always safe).\nThen at turn95: we can stay or go up? We want to go to freeway7 at turn98.\n\nFrom freeway5 at turn95, we can go to freeway6 at turn96, then freeway7 at turn97 -> but turn97 is dangerous.\n\nSo we have to wait at freeway5 until we can go to freeway6 at turn96 and then freeway7 at turn98? But we can only move one per turn.\n\nAfter turn95: we are at y5. Then:\n  Turn95: S -> y5 at turn96 (freeway5 safe)\n  Turn96: U -> y6 at turn97 (freeway6 at dt=7: [49,60] safe)\n  Turn97: U -> y7 at turn98 (freeway7 at dt=8: safe)\n\nThen:\n  Turn98: U -> y8\n  Turn99: U -> y9\n\nBut then the sequence:\n\nTurn90: U -> y3 at91\nTurn91: U -> y4 at92\nTurn92: U -> y5 at93\nTurn93: U -> y6 at94\nTurn94: D -> y5 at95   [freeway5 at dt=5: safe? yes, negative]\nTurn95: S -> y5 at96   [freeway5 at dt=6: safe]\nTurn96: U -> y6 at97   [freeway6 at dt=7: safe]\nTurn97: U -> y7 at98   [freeway7 at dt=8: safe]\nTurn98: U -> y8 at99\nTurn99: U -> y9 at100\n\nTotal moves: 10 again.\n\nWe still have 10 moves.\n\nBut note: we used a down move, which might be avoidable.\n\nHowever, we cannot get below 10 because we must have 7 up moves and we have to avoid freeway7 for 3 turns (turns95,96,97). So we have 7 moves and 3 waits, total 10.\n\nBut is there a way to use only 2 waits? \n\nSuppose we can be at freeway7 at turn98, and we get there as quickly as possible.\n\nWe need 5 up moves to get from y2 to y7: 2->3,3->4,4->5,5->6,6->7: 5 moves.\n\nSo we can be at y7 at turn90+5 = turn95. But turn95 is dangerous. Then we have to avoid being there until turn98. So we must not be at freeway7 during turns95,96,97. We can be at freeway7 at turn98.\n\nBut we cannot \"jump\" over freeway7. So we must leave freeway7 and then come back? But we can only move one step per turn. So if we are at freeway7 at turn95, we can move down to freeway6 at turn96. Then we are at freeway6 at turn96 and turn97? Then at turn97 we move up to freeway7 at turn98.\n\nBut then:\n\nAt turn95: we are at freeway7 -> collision! because at turn95, freeway7 is dangerous.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway7 at turn95 at all. Therefore, we must not arrive at freeway7 until turn98.\n\nSo we must not be at freeway7 at turns95,96,97. The only way is to be at freeway6 at turn97 and then move to freeway7 at turn98.\n\nWe arrive at freeway6 at turn94 (if we go up continuously). Then we have to stay at freeway6 for turns94,95,96,97? But that is four turns: we are at freeway6 at turn94 (arrived at the end of turn93) and then we take actions at turn94,95,96: three actions (S,S,S) and then at turn97 we take U to go to freeway7 at turn98.\n\nSo we are at freeway6 from turn94 to turn97: that's four consecutive turns? But we only need to avoid freeway7 during turns95,96,97. And we are not on freeway7 during these turns because we are at freeway6.\n\nBut we have to check freeway6 at these turns: which we did and it's safe.\n\nSo the minimal H is 10.\n\nNow, we can output the sequence.\n\nBut note: we have multiple sequences that work. The first one we found was:\n\nTurn90: U\nTurn91: U\nTurn92: U\nTurn93: U\nTurn94: S\nTurn95: S\nTurn96: S\nTurn97: U\nTurn98: U\nTurn99: U\n\nThis gets us to y9 at turn100.\n\nBut let me verify the positions:\n\nStart: turn90: y=2\nAfter turn90 (U): turn91: y=3\nAfter turn91 (U): turn92: y=4\nAfter turn92 (U): turn93: y=5\nAfter turn93 (U): turn94: y=6\nAfter turn94 (S): turn95: y=6\nAfter turn95 (S): turn96: y=6\nAfter turn96 (S): turn97: y=6\nAfter turn97 (U): turn98: y=7\nAfter turn98 (U): turn99: y=8\nAfter turn99 (U): turn100: y=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nTurn90: at freeway2? Actually, at turn90: we start at y=2. We take action at turn90, and then we are at y=3 at turn91. But during turn90, we are at y=2? The collision condition: at turn T, we are on freeway y_T.\n\nSo at turn90: we are at y=2 -> freeway2. We check freeway2 at T=90 (dt=0): \n  Car1: [49,60] -> no 0\n  Car2: [1,12] -> no 0 -> safe.\n\nTurn91: we are at y=3 -> freeway3. T=91, dt=1:\n  Car1: [49+12,60+12]=[61,72] -> safe\n  Car2: [1+12,12+12]=[13,24] -> safe.\n\nTurn92: y=4 -> freeway4. T=92, dt=2:\n  Car: [-60-36*2, -25-36*2] = [-132,-97] -> safe.\n\nTurn93: y=5 -> freeway5. T=93, dt=3: [-60-108, -25-108]=[-168,-133] -> safe.\n\nTurn94: y=6 -> freeway6.

T=97, dt=7: [49,60] -> safe.\n\nTurn98: y=7 -> freeway7. T=98, dt=8:\n  Car1: [-31+32, -20+32] = [1,12] -> safe (0 not in [1,12])\n  Car2: [33+32,44+32]=[65,76] -> safe.\n\nTurn99: y=8 -> freeway8. T=99, dt=9:\n  Car: [-26+27, -15+27]=[1,12] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn100: we are at y=9 -> no freeway, safe.\n\nSo it works.\n\nWe can output the sequence.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: S\nTurn 95: S\nTurn 96: S\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\nTurn 99: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Here t1=90, so the actions are for turns 90,91,...,99. And H=10.\n\nNote: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=10.\n\nIs there a sequence with H=9? \n\nSuppose we try to be at y9 at turn99. Then we must have taken 9 actions: from turn90 to turn98.\n\nWe need to go from y2 to y9: 7 moves up. So we can have at most 2 stays.\n\nWe must avoid freeway7 at turns95,96,97.\n\nWe are at freeway2 at turn90.\n\nWe can be at freeway3 at turn91, freeway4 at92, freeway5 at93, freeway6 at94, freeway7 at95? But turn95 is dangerous -> not allowed.\n\nWe could be at freeway7 at turn98? But then we must be at freeway6 at turn97, freeway5 at96, etc.\n\nTo be at freeway7 at turn98: we take an action at turn97 (U) to go from y6 to y7 at turn98.\n\nThen we must be at freeway6 at turn97: so we took an action at turn96 (U or ...) to get to freeway6 at turn97? Actually, to be at freeway6 at turn97, we must have been at freeway5 at turn96 and taken U at turn96? \n\nWe start:\n\nTurn90: must take U (to get to y3 at91) -> action0: U\nTurn91: U -> y4 at92\nTurn92: U -> y5 at93\nTurn93: U -> y6 at94\nTurn94: we can take S or U? If we take U, then we are at freeway7 at turn95 -> dangerous. So we must take S at turn94: then at turn95: y6.\nTurn95: we must not be at freeway7, so we can take S or D? If we take S: then at turn96: y6.\nTurn96: we need to be at freeway6 at turn97? But we are already at freeway6 at turn96. Then at turn96, we take U? Then at turn97: y7 -> but turn97 is dangerous! \n\nAlternatively, at turn95: we take D -> then at turn96: y5. Then at turn96: we take U -> turn97: y6. Then at turn97: we take U -> turn98: y7. Then at turn98: we take U -> turn99: y8 -> but we need to be at y9? \n\nThen we would need another move: at turn98: U -> y8 at99, then at turn99: U -> y9 at100 -> that's 10 moves.\n\nIf at turn96: we are at y5, then we take U at96 to go to y6 at97, then U at97 to go to y7 at98, then U at98 to go to y8 at99, then we need a ninth action? But we are at turn98: we have taken 8 actions (turns90 to97). Then at turn98: we take the ninth action (U) to go to y9 at turn99? \n\nWait: we want to be at y9 at turn99. \n\nSo:\n\nWe need to be at y8 at turn98? Then at turn98 we take U to go to y9 at turn99.\n\nSo we must be at y8 at turn98.\n\nTo be at y8 at turn98, we must have been at y7 at turn97 and taken U at turn97.\n\nBut at turn97: if we are at y7, then we are at freeway7 at turn97 (dt=7) -> which is dangerous (car1: [-3,8] includes 0).\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway7 at turn97.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y7 at turn97. Therefore, we cannot be at y8 at turn98? \n\nWe can be at y8 at turn98 only if we were at y7 at turn97. But that is not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at y8 at turn98 by being at y7 at turn97? There's no other way.\n\nSo it's impossible to be at y8 at turn98 without being at freeway7 at turn97 (which is dangerous).\n\nTherefore, we must be at y7 at turn98 (so that at turn99 we can be at y8, and then turn100 at y9). But that gives 10 moves.\n\nHence, minimal H is 10.\n\nSo we output the sequence we have.\n\nNote: the answer format is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 90: a_{90}\nTurn 91: a_{91}\n...\n}\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: S\nTurn 95: S\nTurn 96: S\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\nTurn 99: U\n}\n\nWe have 10 lines, for turns 90 to 99.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 2)\\) in minimal turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the sequence of actions must navigate the player vertically from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 9\\) in the fewest steps, accounting for car movements and collision conditions.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Player Movement**: The player starts at \\(y = 2\\) and must reach \\(y = 9\\), requiring at least 7 upward moves (U). However, car positions on certain freeways at specific turns necessitate waiting (S) to avoid collisions.\n- **Critical Collision Zone**: Freeway \\(y = 7\\) has cars that pose a collision risk at turns \\(T = 95, 96, 97\\) (relative to \\(t_1 = 90\\), where \\(dt = T - 90\\)):\n  - At \\(dt = 5\\) (turn 95): Car span is \\([-11, 0]\\), which includes 0.\n  - At \\(dt = 6\\) (turn 96): Car span is \\([-7, 4]\\), which includes 0.\n  - At \\(dt = 7\\) (turn 97): Car span is \\([-3, 8]\\), which includes 0.\n  - At \\(dt = 8\\) (turn 98): Car span is \\([1, 12]\\), safe (0 not included).\n- **Strategy**: \n  - Move up continuously from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 6\\) (turns 90–93).\n  - Wait at \\(y = 6\\) for 3 turns (turns 94–96) to avoid being on freeway 7 during unsafe turns (95–97).\n  - Move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 98 (safe), then to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 99, and \\(y = 9\\) at turn 100.\n- **Minimal Turns**: The sequence requires 7 U moves and 3 S moves, totaling 10 actions (turns 90 to 99), which is minimal as fewer turns would either miss the goal or cause a collision.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 90**: U → Reaches \\(y = 3\\) at turn 91. Collision check at \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2): cars at \\([49, 60]\\) and \\([1, 12]\\), 0 not included → safe.\n- **Turn 91**: U → Reaches \\(y = 4\\) at turn 92.

Collision check at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4): car at \\([-132, -97]\\), 0 not included → safe.\n- **Turn 93**: U → Reaches \\(y = 6\\) at turn 94. Collision check at \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5): car at \\([-168, -133]\\), 0 not included → safe.\n- **Turn 94**: S → Stays at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 95.

Collision check at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6): car at \\([49, 60]\\), 0 not included → safe.\n- **Turn 97**: U → Reaches \\(y = 7\\) at turn 98. Collision check at \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7): cars at \\([1, 12]\\) and \\([65, 76]\\), 0 not included → safe.\n- **Turn 98**: U → Reaches \\(y = 8\\) at turn 99.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get the player from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to 8. The current turn is t1 = 91. I have the positions and movements of the cars on each freeway.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For left-moving cars, the span decreases over time because they're moving left, so the head and tail both decrease by s per turn. For right-moving cars, both increase by s per turn.\n\nCollision happens at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y at that turn, and for that freeway, 0 is within the span of some car on that freeway at turn T. Importantly, when you move, you're only on the new row at the next turn, so during the turn when you move, you're still on the previous row.\n\nThe player starts at y=3 at turn 91. I need to get to y=9.\n\nThe actions are U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), or S (stay, y same).\n\nSince we want to minimize H, the number of turns, I should try to go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and there are cars on y=1 to 8, but y=9 has no cars mentioned, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe, I think. The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 might be safe, but y=0 is the starting point or something? The player is at (0,3), and y=0 to 9, so y=0 and y=9 are probably boundaries.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, so when I reach (0,9), I'm done.\n\nNow, let's list the car states for each freeway at turn t1=91.\n\nFreeway k=1: only one car: head -48, tail -95, direction right, speed 48.\n\nDirection right means it's moving right, so span at time T: since at t1, head is -48, tail is -95? Tail should be less than head for right-moving? No, let's see the span definition.\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h], so for k=1, it says (head h, tail τ, direction, speed), so for k=1: head -48, tail -95, right, 48.\n\nBut for right-moving, span should be [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head, so at t1, span is [-95, -48], since τ=-95, h=-48.\n\nAnd it's moving right, so speed 48 per turn, meaning position increases.\n\nSo at turn T, span is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] = [-95 + 48*(T-91), -48 + 48*(T-91)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision if player is on that freeway at turn T and 0 is within the span at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, when moving, during the turn, you're on the starting row until the move is done.\n\nNow, I need to get from y=3 to y=9, so I need to go up 6 units. Each U action increases y by 1, so minimum 6 turns if I could go straight up, but I have to avoid cars, so it might take more if I have to wait or detour.\n\nSince I can only move one step per turn, and I can stay or go down, but going down might not help since I need to go up, but sometimes to avoid a car, I might stay or go down temporarily.\n\nBut since time is critical, I should avoid unnecessary moves.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each turn, whether there is a car at position 0.\n\nThat is, for each y from 1 to 8, and for each turn, whether 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway.\n\nThen, when the player is on that y at that turn, it would collide if 0 is occupied.\n\nSince multiple cars on a freeway, if any car has 0 in span, it's occupied.\n\nNow, turns: let t be the turn number relative to t1. Set t=0 as turn t1.\n\nSo at turn t (global turn t1 + t), player position y_{t1 + t}.\n\nStart at t=0, y=3.\n\nWe need to find actions a_t for t=0 to H-1, such that after H turns, y=9, and no collision during the sequence.\n\ny_{t} for t from 0 to H, with y_0=3, y_H=9.\n\ny_t is position at turn t1 + t.\n\nAction a_t taken at turn t1 + t determines y_{t+1}.\n\na_t is action at time t, so after action a_t, position becomes y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at time t, position is y_t, then action a_t, then position changes to y_{t+1} for time t+1.\n\nCollision at time T if at that time, player is on some y between 1 and 8, and for that y, at time T, there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nTime T is the turn number.\n\nFor each freeway k, and each time T, we can compute if position 0 is occupied on that freeway.\n\nThen, when player is on row y at time T, if y=0 or y=9, no car, so safe. If y between 1 and 8, and occupied, collision.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, as per the grid.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the times when position 0 is occupied.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: y=1\n\nCars: one car: at t1, head h=-48, tail τ=-95, direction right, speed 48.\n\nSpan at time T: since moving right, span [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-95 + 48(T-91), -48 + 48(T-91)]\n\nSet Δt = T - t1, so for Δt relative.\n\nSpan = [-95 + 48 Δt, -48 + 48 Δt]\n\n0 is in span if -95 + 48 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 48 Δt\n\nSo:\n\n-95 + 48 Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 48 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -95 + 48 Δt ≤ 0 => 48 Δt ≤ 95 => Δt ≤ 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so Δt ≤ 1 since integer? Δt is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nT and t1 are integers, I assume, so Δt integer.\n\nSimilarly, all positions and speeds, but speeds are given as integers, so positions change by integer steps.\n\nSo Δt integer.\n\nSo -95 + 48 Δt ≤ 0 => 48 Δt ≤ 95 => Δt ≤ 95/48 = 1.979, so Δt ≤ 1\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -48 + 48 Δt => 48 Δt ≥ 48 => Δt ≥ 1\n\nSo both: Δt ≥ 1 and Δt ≤ 1, so Δt =1\n\nThus, at Δt=1, which is T=t1+1, position 0 is occupied on freeway 1.\n\nFor other times, not occupied.\n\nNow, freeway 2: y=2\n\nCars: two cars.\n\nFirst car: head -48, tail -59, right, speed 12\n\nSecond car: head 24, tail 13, right, speed 12? Tail 13, head 24, so for right-moving, span [τ, h] = [13,24] at t1.\n\nIn the table: for freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 12), and (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head -48, tail -59, right, so span at t1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nMoving right, so at time T: span [-59 + 12 Δt, -48 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 12 Δt\n\nFirst: -59 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 => 12 Δt ≤ 59 => Δt ≤ 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so Δt ≤ 4\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 12 Δt => 12 Δt ≥ 48 => Δt ≥ 4\n\nSo both: Δt ≥4 and Δt ≤4, so Δt=4, occupied at T=t1+4\n\nNow second car on y=2: head 24, tail 13, right, speed 12, span at t1: [13,24]\n\nAt T: [13 + 12 Δt, 24 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span? 13 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 24 + 12 Δt\n\nFirst: 13 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 => 12 Δt ≤ -13 => Δt ≤ -13/12 ≈ -1.083, so Δt ≤ -2? Since Δt integer, 12 Δt ≤ -13, so Δt ≤ -2? Δt = T - t1, T >= t1, so Δt >=0, so 13 + 12 Δt >=13 >0, so left inequality never true, so 0 never in span for this car. So only first car matters for occupation.\n\nThus for y=2, occupied only at Δt=4.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3\n\nCars: same as y=2? (-48, -59, right, 12), and (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nIdentical to freeway 2? But y=3.\n\nFirst car: head -48, tail -59, right, s=12, span [-59 +12 Δt, -48 +12 Δt]\n\n0 in span: same as above, Δt=4.\n\nSecond car: [13+12Δt, 24+12Δt], 0 never in, since min 13>0.\n\nSo occupied at Δt=4 only.\n\nBut player starts at y=3 at t=0 (Δt=0).\n\nAt Δt=0, is position 0 occupied on y=3?\n\nFor first car: at Δt=0, span [-59, -48], 0 not in, since -59 to -48, all negative.\n\nSecond car: [13,24], 13 to 24, all positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo at Δt=0, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, only at Δt=4.\n\nNow freeway 4: y=4\n\nCars: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so moving left.\n\nFor left-moving, span at t1 is [h, τ]? From the rule: left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the car state: (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nFor left-moving, head and tail: since moving left, head is on the left? In the rule: for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], and then [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nIn this case, h=48, τ=83? But if left-moving, head should be larger than tail? Let's see.\n\nIn the rule: for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], so h and τ, with h > τ? But in the car, it says (48, 83), so h=48, τ=83, but 48 < 83, so if [h, τ] = [48,83], but for left-moving, it should be decreasing, so head at 48, tail at 83? That doesn't make sense because tail should be behind.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd it says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\", but for left-moving, if moving left, head should be on the right? I'm confused.\n\nPerhaps for left-moving, the span is from left to right or something.\n\nAssume that for both directions, the span is given as [min, max] or something.\n\nFrom the collision rule: collision if 0 in Span(T), and Span(T) is the interval.\n\nFor left-moving at t1: Span(t1) = [h, τ] with h and τ, and then it moves to [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt].\n\nIn this case for freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36), so h=48, τ=83, so Span(t1) = [48, 83]\n\nBut 48 to 83, so if moving left, it should be decreasing, so at later time, both decrease.\n\nBut head at 48, tail at 83? That seems tail is larger, which might mean tail is on the right if moving left.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's think of the position.\n\nAt t1, for left-moving car, position from h to τ, with h and τ, and since moving left, the head (front) is at min or max?\n\nIn the rule, for left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt], so at t1, it's [h, τ], so the values are decreasing over time.\n\nSo for freeway 4, [48,83] at t1, so the car occupies from 48 to 83, with head at 48? But moving left, so head is at the left end, I think.\n\nBut for collision, we care about whether 0 is in the interval.\n\nSo at time T, span [48 - 36 Δt, 83 - 36 Δt]\n\n0 in span if 48 - 36 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 83 - 36 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36 Δt ≤ 0 => 48 ≤ 36 Δt => Δt ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so Δt ≥ 2 since integer?

But we might need to stay or go down to avoid, so H >=6.\n\nNow, let's see the occupation times.\n\nFirst, at t=0, y=3, not occupied, so safe.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nThe critical points are when rows are occupied.\n\nFor example, y=4 and y=5 are occupied at Δt=2, so at turn t=2, if player is on y=4 or y=5, collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 occupied at t=1, y=2 and y=3 at t=4, y=7 and y=8 at t=4,5,6,7 except y=7 not at t=7, etc.\n\ny=6 is always safe, since never occupied.\n\ny=6 is free, good.\n\nNow, to go up, we need to pass through y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut y=4 and y=5 have a problem at t=2.\n\ny=2 and y=3 at t=4, etc.\n\nPlayer at t=0, y=3.\n\nAction a0 at t=0, then y1 = y0 + Δy0.\n\nWe need to plan the path.\n\nSince we want min H, and H is the number of turns from start to end.\n\nLet me define the state (time, position).\n\nStart: t=0, y=3.\n\nGoal: some t, y=9.\n\nFrom t=0, we can choose a0:\n\n- If U, y1=4\n\n- If D, y1=2\n\n- If S, y1=3\n\nBut D might not be useful, since we need to go up.\n\nSimilarly, S might delay.\n\nBut to avoid, we might need to.\n\nNow, at t=1, if player is on y=1, it is occupied, so must avoid being on y=1 at t=1.\n\nBut player starts at y=3, so at t=1, after action at t=0.\n\nIf at t=0, we go U, to y=4 at t=1.\n\nOr S, to y=3 at t=1.\n\nOr D, to y=2 at t=1.\n\nNow, at t=1, y=1 is occupied, so we cannot be on y=1 at t=1.\n\nBut if we go D to y=2, y=2 at t=1 is not occupied, since only at t=4 for y=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at t=1 not occupied.\n\ny=4 at t=1 not occupied, only at t=2 for y=4? y=4 occupied at t=2.\n\nt=1 is Δt=1, from table, y=4 not occupied at Δt=1.\n\nΔt=1: y=1 yes, others no except y=1.\n\nSo at t=1, positions:\n\n- If on y=1: collision\n\n- Else: safe.\n\nSo from start, if we go D to y=2 at t=1, safe.\n\nIf S to y=3 at t=1, safe.\n\nIf U to y=4 at t=1, safe.\n\nBut if we go U to y=4 at t=1, then at t=1, we are on y=4, which is safe since not occupied at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, we choose action for t=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=4 and y=5 are occupied.\n\nSo if at t=2, player is on y=4 or y=5, collision.\n\nNow, at t=1, if player is on y=4, then for t=2, if we stay or go down or up, but if we stay, y=4 at t=2, occupied, collision.\n\nIf go up to y=5, y=5 at t=2 occupied, collision.\n\nIf go down to y=3, then at t=2, y=3 is not occupied (only at t=4), so safe.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=1, player is on y=3, then at t=2, we can go U to y=4, but at t=2, y=4 occupied, so if we go to y=4 at t=2, collision.\n\nIf S to y=3, y=3 not occupied at t=2, safe.\n\nIf D to y=2, y=2 not occupied at t=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=1 on y=2, similar.\n\nBut we want to go up, so let's avoid going down if possible.\n\nNow, back to t=0.\n\nIf at t=0 we go U to y=4 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, we are on y=4. Now, for t=2, we must not be on y=4 or y=5. So we can go D to y=3 at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, y=3 not occupied, safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut we lost time by going up and down.\n\nAt t=0, if we go S, to y=3 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, y=3 safe.\n\nThen at t=1, we need to choose action for t=2.\n\nAt t=2, we cannot be on y=4 or y=5.\n\nSo if we go U to y=4, collision at t=2.\n\nIf S, stay y=3, safe.\n\nIf D to y=2, safe.\n\nBut we want to go up, so S or D delays.\n\nIf we go S at t=1, to y=3 at t=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=2, we can go U to y=4 at t=3? At t=3, y=4 is not occupied, since only at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 not occupied at t=3.\n\nSo let's list the occupation again.\n\nFrom table:\n\nΔt=0: all safe except? y=1 to8, all not occupied at Δt=0.\n\nΔt=1: only y=1 occupied\n\nΔt=2: y=4 and y=5 occupied\n\nΔt=3: all safe? y=1 to8, from table, at Δt=3:\n\ny=1: no\n\ny=2: no (only Δt=4)\n\ny=3: no\n\ny=4: no (only Δt=2)\n\ny=5: no\n\ny=6: no\n\ny=7: no? y=7 occupied at Δt=4,5,6, not 3\n\ny=8: no, occupied from 4 to7\n\nSo at Δt=3, all rows safe.\n\nΔt=4: y=2,3,7,8 occupied\n\ny=2: yes, y=3: yes, y=7: yes, y=8: yes\n\ny=4,5,6 no\n\netc.\n\nNow, back to player.\n\nStart t=0, y=3, safe.\n\nOption 1: at t=0, go U to y=4 at t=1.\n\nt=1, y=4, safe (since not occupied at t=1)\n\nThen at t=1, we must avoid being on y=4 or y=5 at t=2.\n\nSo we can go D to y=3 at t=2.\n\nt=2, y=3, not occupied (occupied only at t=4), safe.\n\nNow at t=2, y=3.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom t=2, we can go up.\n\nBut at t=4, y=2 and y=3 are occupied, so we need to not be on y=2 or y=3 at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and y=8 occupied at t=4,5,6,7.\n\nFirst, from t=2, y=3.\n\nAt t=2, we choose action.\n\nWe can go U to y=4 at t=3.\n\nt=3, Δt=3, all safe, so y=4 safe.\n\nThen at t=3, on y=4.\n\nWe can go U to y=5 at t=4.\n\nBut at t=4, y=5 is not occupied? y=5 occupied only at t=2, not at t=4.\n\nt=4 is Δt=4.\n\ny=5 occupied only at Δt=2, not at Δt=4.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 not at Δt=4.\n\nBut at t=4, y=2 and y=3 occupied, but we are on y=5.\n\ny=5 at t=4: Δt=4, y=5 not occupied, as per table.\n\nThen go U to y=6 at t=5.\n\ny=6 always safe.\n\nThen from y=6, we need to go to y=7,8,9.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 are occupied at t=4,5,6,7.\n\nt=5 is Δt=5, y=7 and y=8 occupied.\n\nSimilarly t=6,7.\n\nNow, at t=4, we are on y=5, safe.\n\nAction at t=4: go U to y=6 at t=5.\n\nt=5, y=6, safe, since y=6 never occupied.\n\nThen at t=5, on y=6.\n\nWe need to go to y=7, but at t=5, if we go to y=7, at t=6 we are on y=7, but y=7 occupied at t=5? Collision at time T if on y at T and occupied.\n\nAt t=5, if we are on y=6, safe.\n\nAction at t=5: if we go U to y=7 at t=6.\n\nThen at t=6, we are on y=7.\n\nBut at t=6, Δt=6, y=7 occupied, so collision.\n\nIf we go S at t=5, stay y=6 at t=6, safe.\n\nBut then we need to go up later.\n\nIf we go U at t=5 to y=7 at t=6, collision.\n\nSo not good.\n\nAt t=5, we could go D, but that might not help.\n\nSince y=7 occupied at t=5,6, we need to avoid being on y=7 at those times.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\ny=7 occupied at t=4,5,6? Δt=4,5,6.\n\nt=4: Δt=4, y=7 occupied.\n\nt=5: Δt=5, y=7 occupied.\n\nt=6: Δt=6, y=7 occupied.\n\nt=7: Δt=7, y=7 not occupied, but y=8 occupied.\n\nt=8: all safe except possibly others, but y=7 and y=8 not occupied at t=8.\n\nFrom table, Δt=8: y=1 no, y=2 no (only Δt=4), y=3 no, y=4 no, y=5 no, y=6 no, y=7 no (occupied up to Δt=6), y=8 no (occupied up to Δt=7, Δt=7 occupied, Δt=8 not).\n\nΔt=7: y=8 occupied, Δt=8 not.\n\nSo at t=7, y=8 occupied, t=8 not.\n\nBack to the path.\n\nIn the first option, we are at t=4, on y=5.\n\nInstead of going to y=6 at t=5, we could stay or something, but we need to go up.\n\nAt t=4, on y=5, we can go U to y=6 at t=5, safe.\n\nThen at t=5, on y=6.\n\nNow, y=7 occupied at t=5 and t=6, so we cannot go to y=7 at t=6 or stay on y=7 at those times.\n\nSo at t=5, if we go S, stay y=6 at t=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=6, on y=6.\n\nNow, at t=6, y=7 still occupied (Δt=6), so we cannot go to y=7 at t=7? Action at t=6 determines y at t=7.\n\nAt t=6, we are on y=6, choose action.\n\nIf we go U to y=7 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, we are on y=7.\n\nΔt=7, from table, y=7 not occupied at Δt=7? Δt=7: y=7 occupied only up to Δt=6, Δt=7 not occupied.\n\ny=7 occupied at Δt=4,5,6, not at 7.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 occupied at Δt=4,5,6,7.\n\nAt t=7, Δt=7:\n\ny=7: not occupied\n\ny=8: occupied\n\nIf at t=6, we go U to y=7 at t=7, then at t=7, y=7 not occupied, so safe.\n\nThen from there, go to y=8 or y=9.\n\nBut y=8 at t=7 occupied, so if we go to y=8 at t=7, collision.\n\nAt t=7, on y=7, we can go U to y=8 at t=8.\n\nt=8, y=8, but at t=8, Δt=8, y=8 not occupied, safe.\n\nThen go to y=9 at t=9.\n\nNow, let's list the sequence.\n\nFirst, from start:\n\nt=0: y=3, go U to y=4 at t=1\n\nt=1: y=4, go D to y=3 at t=2? Earlier I said go D to avoid t=2.\n\nt=1: y=4, go D to y=3 at t=2\n\nt=2: y=3, go U to y=4 at t=3 (t=3 all safe)\n\nt=3: y=4, go U to y=5 at t=4\n\nt=4: y=5, go U to y=6 at t=5\n\nt=5: y=6, go S to y=6 at t=6? Or go U later.\n\nAt t=5, y=6, if we go S, stay at t=6, y=6 safe.\n\nThen at t=6, y=6, go U to y=7 at t=7\n\nt=7: y=7, not occupied (Δt=7), safe.\n\nThen go U to y=8 at t=8\n\nt=8: y=8, not occupied (Δt=8), safe.\n\nThen go U to y=9 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=9, goal.\n\nNow, H is the number of actions from t=0 to t=8, so 9 actions? Let's see the turns.\n\nActions at t=0 to t=8, for 9 actions, to reach y at t=9.\n\ny at time t: after H actions, y_H =9.\n\nStart at t=0, y_0=3.\n\nAfter first action a0, y1 at t=1.\n\nAfter second action a1, y2 at t=2.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, y_k at t=k.\n\nSet y_t at time t.\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action at time t, y_{t+1}.\n\nTo have y_T =9 for some T.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_H at time H.\n\nSince start at t=0, after H actions, at time H.\n\ny_H =9.\n\nIn this case, from above, at time t=9, y=9.\n\nWe took actions at t=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8: 9 actions.\n\nBut we might do better.\n\nIn this sequence, we went down at t=1, which cost an extra move.\n\nAt t=0, instead of going up, we could stay or go down to avoid the t=2 issue differently.\n\nAnother idea: since y=4 and y=5 are bad only at t=2, we can be on them at other times.\n\nFor example, at t=0, go S to y=3 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=1, go S again to y=3 at t=2.\n\nt=2, y=3, not occupied, safe.\n\nThen at t=2, go U to y=4 at t=3.\n\nt=3, y=4, safe.\n\nThen go U to y=5 at t=4.\n\nt=4, y=5, not occupied (only bad at t=2), safe.\n\nThen go U to y=6 at t=5.\n\nt=5, y=6, safe.\n\nNow same as before, at t=5, we need to go to y=7, but y=7 occupied at t=5,6.\n\nSo at t=5, on y=6, we can go S to stay at t=6, y=6.\n\nThen at t=6, go U to y=7 at t=7.\n\nt=7, y=7, not occupied, safe.\n\nThen go U to y=8 at t=8.\n\nt=8, y=8, not occupied (Δt=8), safe.\n\nThen go U to y=9 at t=9.\n\nSame as before, 9 turns to t=9.\n\nBut we used two S actions, similarly inefficient.\n\nAt t=0, go U to y=4 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, instead of going down, can we go up? To y=5 at t=2, but t=2 y=5 occupied, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo S at t=1 to y=4 at t=2, but t=2 occupied, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo from y=4 at t=1, only down to y=3 is safe for t=2.\n\nUnless we go to y=6 or something, but we can only move one step.\n\nSo we have to go down or stay, but stay causes collision.\n\nSo must go down to y=3.\n\nThus, the detour is necessary at the beginning.\n\nBut perhaps we can avoid it by delaying the first move.\n\nAt t=0, go D to y=2 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, y=2, not occupied (only at t=4), safe.\n\nThen at t=1, we can go U to y=3 at t=2.\n\nt=2, y=3, not occupied, safe.\n\nThen at t=2, go U to y=4 at t=3.\n\nt=3, y=4, safe.\n\nThen U to y=5 at t=4.\n\nt=4, y=5, not occupied, safe.\n\nThen U to y=6 at t=5.\n\nSame as before, then stuck at y=6 until t=7 or something.\n\nAt t=5, on y=6, cannot go to y=7 immediately because occupied.\n\nSo we need to wait until t=6 to go to y=7 at t=7? At t=6, if on y=6, go U to y=7 at t=7.\n\nt=7 y=7 safe.\n\nThen U to y=8 at t=8.\n\nU to y=9 at t=9.\n\nStill 9 turns.\n\nBut in this case, we went down at start, worse.\n\nSo all these take 9 turns.\n\nBut min should be 6, but we have obstacles.\n\nNow, to reduce time, we need to pass y=7 and y=8 when not occupied.\n\ny=7 occupied at t=4,5,6\n\ny=8 occupied at t=4,5,6,7\n\nSo y=7 is free at t=3,7,8,etc.\n\nt=3: Δt=3, all safe, so y=7 safe at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 safe at t=3,8,etc.\n\nBut at t=3, we might not be on y=7 yet.\n\nSimilarly, t=7 y=7 safe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 faster, we need to be on higher rows earlier.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=6 by t=3 or something.\n\nStart at t=0 y=3.\n\nIf we go U at t=0 to y=4 at t=1.\n\nThen we have to go down to y=3 at t=2, as before.\n\nThen at t=2 y=3.\n\nThen U to y=4 at t=3.\n\nU to y=5 at t=4.\n\nBut at t=4, we can go U to y=6 at t=5.\n\nThen at t=5 y=6.\n\nNow, instead of waiting, can we go directly to y=9?\n\ny=7 occupied at t=5, so we cannot go to y=7 at t=6.\n\nBut at t=5, on y=6, we could go U to y=7 at t=6, but t=6 y=7 occupied, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo we must wait until t=6 to go to y=7 at t=7.\n\nAt t=6, on y=6, go U to y=7 at t=7.\n\nt=7 y=7 safe.\n\nThen U to y=8 at t=8.\n\nU to y=9 at t=9.\n\n9 turns.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach y=6 earlier.\n\nStart at t=0 y=3.\n\nGo U to y=4 at t=1.\n\nThen go D to y=3 at t=2. (to avoid)\n\nThen at t=2 y=3, go U to y=4 at t=3.\n\nt=3 y=4.\n\nNow, at t=3, we can go U to y=5 at t=4.\n\nt=4 y=5.\n\nThen U to y=6 at t=5.\n\nAs before.\n\nAt t=3 y=4, we could go U to y=5 at t=4, same.\n\nOr, since y=6 is free, we could go directly, but we can only move one step.\n\nAnother idea: at t=0, go S to y=3 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, go U to y=4 at t=2, but t=2 y=4 occupied, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt t=1, go S to y=3 at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, go U to y=4 at t=3.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nSo no way to be on y=5 or y=6 before t=4 or 5.\n\nEarliest to be on y=5: if we go U at t=0 to y=4 at t=1, but then cannot go to y=5 at t=2 because occupied, so must go down, then at t=3 to y=4, t=4 to y=5.\n\nSo y=5 at t=4 earliest.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at t=5.\n\nThen from y=6, we need to go to y=7, but y=7 occupied until t=6, so at t=6 we can be on y=6 or go to y=7 at t=7.\n\nIf at t=5 y=6, we can stay at t=6 y=6, then at t=6 go U to y=7 at t=7.\n\ny=7 at t=7 safe.\n\nThen y=8 at t=8, y=9 at t=9.\n\nCan we reach y=8 earlier?\n\ny=8 occupied at t=4,5,6,7, so first safe at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, y=8 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 safe at t=7.\n\nSo we can be on y=7 at t=7, y=8 at t=8, y=9 at t=9.\n\nNo earlier.\n\nBut is there a way to be on y=7 at t=3?\n\nAt t=3, y=7 is safe, but can we be there?\n\nStart t=0 y=3.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=3, need to go up 4 steps in 3 actions: from t=0 to t=3, actions at t=0,1,2 to reach y at t=3.\n\ny at t=3 depends on actions at t=0,1,2.\n\ny3 = y0 + Δy0 + Δy1 + Δy2.\n\ny0=3, so y3 = 3 + Δy0 + Δy1 + Δy2.\n\nEach Δy = -1,0,1.\n\nTo have y3=7, need Δy0 + Δy1 + Δy2 =4.\n\nSince each <=1, must have all U, so Δy0=1, Δy1=1, Δy2=1, y3=6.\n\ny3=3+1+1+1=6, not 7.\n\nMaximum in 3 steps: from y=3, after 3 ups, y=6 at t=3.\n\ny at time t after actions.\n\nAt time t, after t actions from start? Let's clarify.\n\nAt time 0: before any action, y=3.\n\nAfter action a0 at time 0, y at time 1: y1 = y0 + Δy0.\n\nAfter action a1 at time 1, y at time 2: y2 = y1 + Δy1.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{k-1} at time k-1, y at time k.\n\nTo have y at time k.\n\nAt time 0: y=3\n\nAt time 1: y= y0 + Δy0\n\nAt time 2: y= y0 + Δy0 + Δy1\n\nAt time 3: y= y0 + Δy0 + Δy1 + Δy2 = 3 + sum_{i=0}^2 Δy_i\n\nEach Δy_i in {-1,0,1}, so at time 3, y <= 3+3=6, so cannot be at y=7 at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, at t=4, y <= 3+4=7, so can be at y=7 at t=4 if all U.\n\nBut at t=4, y=7 is occupied! Δt=4, y=7 occupied.\n\nSo cannot be on y=7 at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, at t=5, y<=8, but y=7 occupied at t=5.\n\nt=6 y=7 occupied.\n\nt=7 y=7 not occupied.\n\nSo earliest to be on y=7 is t=7.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, earliest t=8.\n\nThen y=9 at t=9.\n\nNow, to be on y=7 at t=7, we need to reach it by then.\n\nSimilarly, we need to be on lower rows at appropriate times.\n\nIn the sequence I had, we reach y=6 at t=5, which is fine, then wait at y=6 until t=6, then go to y=7 at t=7.\n\nBut at t=6, we are on y=6, and we go U at t=6 to y=7 at t=7.\n\nWe don't need to stay; we can go directly from y=6 at t=6 to y=7 at t=7, which is safe.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=5, y=6, we can go U at t=5 to y=7 at t=6? No, because at t=6 y=7 occupied.\n\nIf we go U at t=5, y at t=6 is y=7, which is occupied at t=6, collision.\n\nSo we must not go to y=7 at t=6.\n\nTherefore, at t=5, on y=6, we must not go U; we must stay or go down, but staying is better.\n\nThen at t=6, on y=6, go U to y=7 at t=7.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut we have an extra stay at y=6 for one turn.\n\nSimilarly, in the beginning, we had to go down.\n\nBut perhaps we can avoid the down move by timing.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 is always safe, we can go to y=6 as fast as possible and wait there.\n\nEarliest to y=6: from y=3, with three U: at t=3, y=6.\n\nBut to do that, we need to pass y=4 and y=5 at some times.\n\nAt t=1, if we are on y=4, we need to avoid t=2.\n\nBut to be at y=6 at t=3, we need:\n\nAction at t=0: U to y=4 at t=1\n\nThen action at t=1: U to y=5 at t=2\n\nBut at t=2, y=5 occupied, collision.\n\nAction at t=0: U to y=4 at t=1\n\nAction at t=1: S to y=4 at t=2, but t=2 occupied, collision.\n\nAction at t=0: U to y=4 at t=1\n\nAction at t=1: D to y=3 at t=2, then at t=2 y=3, then action at t=2: U to y=4 at t=3, not to y=6.\n\nTo reach y=6 at t=3, we need actions: a0=U, a1=U, a2=U, so y1=4, y2=5, y3=6.\n\nBut y2=5 at t=2 occupied, collision.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=6 at t=3.\n\nNext, at t=4: can we be at y=6?\n\ny at t=4: 3 + sum_{i=0}^3 Δy_i\n\nMax 3+4=7, min 3-4=-1, but constrained.\n\nTo have y4=6, need sum Δy =3.\n\nWith the constraints.\n\nFor example, at t=0: go U to y=4 at t=1\n\nThen to avoid t=2, go D to y=3 at t=2\n\nThen at t=2, go U to y=4 at t=3\n\nThen at t=3, go U to y=5 at t=4? y4=5, not 6.\n\nTo have y4=6, need another up, but only three actions from t=0 to t=3 for y at t=4.\n\ny4 depends on a0,a1,a2,a3.\n\na0 at t=0, a1 at t=1, a2 at t=2, a3 at t=3, then y at t=4.\n\nSo y4 = 3 + Δy0 + Δy1 + Δy2 + Δy3\n\nSet to 6, so Δy0 + Δy1 + Δy2 + Δy3 =3\n\nNow, with the path constraints.\n\nSuppose a0=U, y1=4\n\nThen a1: if U, y2=5, but at t=2, y=5 occupied, invalid.\n\nIf a1=D, y2=3\n\nThen a2: U, y3=4\n\nThen a3: U, y4=5\n\ny4=5, not 6.\n\nIf a2=S, y3=3, then a3=U, y4=4\n\nWorse.\n\nSo with this, y4=5 max in this path.\n\nIf start with S at t=0, y1=3\n\nThen a1: S or D or U.\n\nIf a1=U, y2=4, but t=2 y=4 occupied, collision.\n\nIf a1=S, y2=3\n\nThen a2=U, y3=4\n\na3=U, y4=5\n\ny4=5.\n\nIf a1=D, y2=2\n\nThen a2=U, y3=3\n\na3=U, y4=4\n\nWorse.\n\nSo cannot reach y=6 at t=4? y4=5 is possible, as above.\n\nIn the first sequence with detour, at t=4 we have y=5.\n\nTo have y4=6, need to go up three times and no down, but we had to go down once, so we have only two net up in four actions, y=5.\n\nWithout down, we cannot avoid the collision at t=2, so we must have a down or stay that reduces progress.\n\nThus, earliest at y=6 is t=5, as in the sequence.\n\nThen from there, we can go to y=7 at t=7, y=8 at t=8, y=9 at t=9.\n\nBut at t=8, y=8 is safe, and we can be there.\n\nNow, can we reach y=9 earlier than t=9?\n\nFor example, at t=8, if we are on y=8, we can go to y=9 at t=9.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at t=8, we need to come from y=7 at t=7 or y=8 at t=7 with stay.\n\nBut y=8 at t=7 occupied, so cannot be on y=8 at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, we can be on y=7, which is safe, then go to y=8 at t=8.\n\nSo y=8 at t=8, then y=9 at t=9.\n\nCannot be faster.\n\nThus, min H=9 turns.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have actions.\n\nLet's write the sequence with times.\n\nt is time, action at t determines y at t+1.\n\nStart: t=0, y=3\n\nAction a0: let's choose a sequence.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt t=0: U → y=4 at t=1\n\nt=1: D → y=3 at t=2  (to avoid t=2 on y=4 or5)\n\nt=2: U → y=4 at t=3\n\nt=3: U → y=5 at t=4\n\nt=4: U → y=6 at t=5\n\nt=5: S → y=6 at t=6  (wait, since y=7 occupied at t=6)\n\nAt t=5, y=6, go S to stay at y=6 for t=6\n\nThen t=6: U → y=7 at t=7\n\nt=7: U → y=8 at t=8\n\nt=8: U → y=9 at t=9\n\nNow, at t=9, y=9, goal.\n\nActions: a0=U, a1=D, a2=U, a3=U, a4=U, a5=S, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U\n\nThat's 9 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=5, we used S to stay.\n\nBut at t=6, we are on y=6, which is fine, and we go U to y=7 at t=7.\n\nSince y=7 is safe at t=7.\n\nNow, another sequence: after reaching y=6 at t=5, we could go directly to U at t=5, but that would go to y=7 at t=6, collision, not possible.\n\nSo must stay or go down, but staying is better.\n\nIn the beginning, we could have a different start.\n\nFor example, at t=0: S → y=3 at t=1\n\nt=1: S → y=3 at t=2  (safe)\n\nt=2: U → y=4 at t=3\n\nt=3: U → y=5 at t=4\n\nt=4: U → y=6 at t=5\n\nThen same as above: t=5: S → y=6 at t=6\n\nt=6: U → y=7 at t=7\n\nt=7: U → y=8 at t=8\n\nt=8: U → y=9 at t=9\n\nActions: a0=S, a1=S, a2=U, a3=U, a4=U, a5=S, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U\n\nStill 9 actions, but with two S at start.\n\nThe first sequence has one D and one S, which might be similar.\n\nBut in terms of time, same.\n\nCan we avoid the S at t=5?\n\nFor example, by going to y=8 directly or something.\n\nBut y=8 occupied at t=5,6,7.\n\nAt t=5, if we are on y=6, we can only go to y=5,6,7.\n\ny=7 occupied.\n\ny=6 safe.\n\ny=5: but y=5 not occupied at t=5, but going down might not help.\n\nSuppose at t=5, on y=6, go D to y=5 at t=6.\n\nt=6, y=5, not occupied, safe.\n\nBut then we are lower, need to go up later, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, min H=9.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can be on y=9 at t=8 or earlier.\n\nAt t=8, y<=3+8=11, but y=9 possible only if we go up 6 steps in 8 actions, but we have delays.\n\nFor example, if no delays, y=9 at t=6, but t=6 y=9? y at t=6: 3+6=9 if all U.\n\nBut to go all U, need to pass y=4 at t=1, y=5 at t=2.\n\nBut y=5 at t=2 occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at t=2 occupied if we stay, but we go to y=5.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nWith the detour, we have to take extra actions.\n\nThus, H=9 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to output the actions starting from turn t1=91.\n\nSo actions at turn 91, 92, ..., up to 99? t from 0 to 8, global turn t1 + t = 91 + t.\n\nAction at turn 91: a0\n\nTurn 92: a1\n\n...\n\nTurn 99: a8, then at turn 100, y=9? Let's see.\n\nAfter action at turn T, y at turn T+1.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn t1=91, position y=3.\n\nAction a_{t1} at turn 91 determines y at turn 92.\n\nSimilarly, action a_{t1 + k} at turn t1 + k determines y at turn t1 + k +1.\n\nWe need y at some turn to be 9.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, y =9.\n\nIn the sequence, after 9 actions, at turn 91+9=100, y=9.\n\nActions at turn 91 to 99.\n\nNow, for the sequence.\n\nI need to write the actions.\n\nIn the first sequence:\n\nAt turn 91: U  (to y=4 at turn 92)\n\nTurn 92: D  (to y=3 at turn 93)\n\nTurn 93: U  (to y=4 at turn 94)\n\nTurn 94: U  (to y=5 at turn 95)\n\nTurn 95: U  (to y=6 at turn 96)\n\nTurn 96: S  (to y=6 at turn 97)  // since y=6 at turn 97\n\nIn terms of turns:\n\nAction at turn t, y at turn t+1.\n\nAt turn 91: a=U, y at 92=4\n\nTurn 92: a=D, y at 93=3\n\nTurn 93: a=U, y at 94=4\n\nTurn 94: a=U, y at 95=5\n\nTurn 95: a=U, y at 96=6\n\nTurn 96: a=S, y at 97=6  // now turn 97, y=6\n\nAt turn 97, we need to go to y=7 at turn 98, but at turn 97, if we go U, y at 98=7.\n\nThen at turn 98, y=7, which is time t=7 relative, Δt=7, y=7 not occupied, safe.\n\nThen at turn 98: a=U, y at 99=8\n\nTurn 99: a=U, y at 100=9\n\ny at turn 100=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, we have actions from turn 91 to 99, that's 9 actions.\n\nIn the turn 96 action: S, to stay at y=6 for turn 97.\n\nThen at turn 97: U to y=7 at turn 98.\n\nIn my earlier list, I had turn 96: S, then turn 97: U? Turn 97 action.\n\nIn the sequence above: actions at turn 91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99.\n\n9 actions.\n\nNow, at turn 97: action U, to y=7 at turn 98.\n\nThen turn 98: U to y=8 at turn 99\n\nTurn 99: U to y=9 at turn 100.\n\nAll good.\n\nTo avoid the S, but we can't.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 96, we used S, but we could have used another action, but not necessary.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nBut let's write the actions clearly.\n\nAlso, in the beginning, we used D, which is down.\n\nBut it's fine.\n\nAnother sequence with no D, but with S.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 91: S → y=3 at turn 92\n\nTurn 92: S → y=3 at turn 93  // since at turn 93, Δt=2? Global turn.\n\nt1=91, Δt=0 at turn 91.\n\nAt turn 91, action a, y at turn 92.\n\nPosition at turn T.\n\nAt turn 91, y=3.\n\nAction at turn 91: S, then y at turn 92: 3\n\nAction at turn 92: S, then y at turn 93: 3\n\nAction at turn 93: U, then y at turn 94: 4\n\nAction at turn 94: U, then y at turn 95: 5\n\nAction at turn 95: U, then y at turn 96: 6\n\nAction at turn 96: S, then y at turn 97: 6\n\nAction at turn 97: U, then y at turn 98: 7\n\nAction at turn 98: U, then y at turn 99: 8\n\nAction at turn 99: U, then y at turn 100: 9\n\nSame number.\n\nIn this case, actions: S,S,U,U,U,S,U,U,U\n\nCompared to U,D,U,U,U,S,U,U,U\n\nBoth have 9 actions.\n\nI think it's minimal.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the task, it says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so from t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn the box.\n\nAlso, current turn is t1=91.\n\nSo actions at turn 91, 92, ..., up to turn 91 + H -1.\n\nH=9, so actions at turn 91 to 99.\n\nNow, I'll choose the first sequence with U and D.\n\nTo make it with fewer direction changes, but not necessary.\n\nSince y=6 is safe, we can go there and stay.\n\nIn the sequence, we have one down and one stay, or two stays, etc.\n\nBut all fine.\n\nNow, write the answer.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on y=3 at t=4.\n\nIn the sequence, at which point are we on y=3.\n\nFor example, in first sequence, at turn 93, y=3? No.\n\nIn first sequence:\n\nAt turn 91: action U, y at 92=4\n\nTurn 92: action D, y at 93=3\n\nTurn 93: action U, y at 94=4\n\nNow, at time turn 93, y=3, which is Δt=93-91=2, relative t=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=3 not occupied, as per table.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 94, y=4, Δt=3, not occupied.\n\nTurn 95, y=5, Δt=4, y=5 not occupied (only at Δt=2), safe.\n\nTurn 96, y=6, Δt=5, safe.\n\nTurn 97, y=6, Δt=6, safe.\n\nTurn 98, y=7, Δt=7, y=7 not occupied, safe.\n\nTurn 99, y=8, Δt=8, y=8 not occupied, safe.\n\nTurn 100, y=9, goal.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions:\n\nAt turn 91: U\n\nTurn 92: D\n\nTurn 93: U\n\nTurn 94: U\n\nTurn 95: U\n\nTurn 96: S\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 91: a_{91} = U\n\nTurn 92: a_{92} = D\n\netc.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nAlso, H=9.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so 9 actions.\n\nNow, I think this is correct.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 3, we have cars, but since we avoid, it should be fine.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 96, we used S, but is there a way to not use S?\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=7 at t=7 without waiting.\n\nBut from y=6, we need to be at y=7 at t=7, which requires going U at t=6 to y=7 at t=7.\n\nAt t=6, we are on y=6, so action at t=6 to go to y=7 at t=7.\n\nBut at t=6, if we are on y=6, it's fine.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 96, we are on y=6 (at turn 96), action S to stay at y=6 for turn 97.\n\nThen at turn 97, action U to go to y=7 at turn 98.\n\nBut at turn 97, we are on y=6, we can directly go U to y=7 at turn 98.\n\nWe don't need to stay; we can go from y=6 at turn 97 to y=7 at turn 98 with action at turn 97.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAfter action at turn 96: S, y at turn 97=6\n\nThen at turn 97: U, y at turn 98=7\n\nBut if at turn 96, we do nothing, we have to take action.\n\nSince at turn 96, y=6, we can instead go U at turn 96? But if go U at turn 96, y at turn 97=7, but turn 97 is Δt=6? Global turn.\n\nt1=91, turn 97: t=97, Δt=97-91=6\n\nAt Δt=6, y=7 occupied, so if y=7 at turn 97, collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot go U at turn 96; we must stay or go down at turn 96 to remain at y=6 for turn 97.\n\nThen at turn 97, go U to y=7 at turn 98.\n\nSo the S at turn 96 is necessary to wait.\n\nThus, sequence is fine.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 91\\) is 9.

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 92.\n\nThe player moves vertically: U (up) increases y by 1, D (down) decreases y by 1, S (stay) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The span is the positions covered by the car.\n\nCars move horizontally: left-moving cars decrease their position over time, right-moving increase. The span is given as [head, tail] or [tail, head], but from the update, for left-moving, it's [h, τ] and moves left, so h decreases. Similarly for right-moving, [τ, h] moves right, so τ and h increase.\n\nIn the car state table, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). I need to interpret head and tail correctly based on direction.\n\nFor example, on freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48). Direction is right, so since it's moving right, the head should be the front when moving right. In the span description, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" and it moves to [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]. Similarly for left.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48). Here, h=0, τ=-47? But for right-moving, span is [τ, h], so [tail, head]? Let's see the notation.\n\nIt says: for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd in the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). So for right-moving, head is the front, tail is the back, so when moving right, span is from tail to head, with tail < head.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\" and since it's moving left, h should be the front when moving left, so h decreases.\n\nIn the car state, for left-moving, it's (head, tail, direction, speed), so for left-moving, head is the leftmost point? Let's clarify.\n\nFor freeway 4: (12, 47, left, 36). Direction left, so head should be the front when moving left. So at t_1, span is [h, τ] = [12, 47]? But if moving left, and head is 12, tail is 47, but 12 to 47, that's increasing, but moving left, so positions should decrease? I think I have confusion.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving car: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" and it moves to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so the entire span shifts left by s per turn.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: span [τ, h] shifts right by s per turn.\n\nIn the car state, the tuple is (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor left-moving, since span is [h, τ] and h decreases, so h must be the right end? I think I need to define what head and tail mean.\n\nPerhaps head is always the front of the car, and tail is the back, relative to direction.\n\nFor a left-moving car, front is left, so head is smaller number, tail is larger number? No.\n\nLet's think coordinates. Assume x-axis, 0 is the point we care about, positions to left are negative, right are positive, I think.\n\nIn the collision, it's if 0 in span, so positions are on a line.\n\nFor a car moving left, its front (head) is decreasing, so at t_1, head position is h, tail is τ, and since it's moving left, head should be greater than tail if left is negative, but let's see values.\n\nFor freeway 4: (12, 47, left, 36). If moving left, and head is 12, tail is 47, that means the car is from 12 to 47, with head at 12? But moving left, head should be decreasing, so from high to low? Positions: if head is at 12 and moving left, it should go to smaller numbers, so tail at 47 is behind, so the span is from head to tail, but since moving left, head is right, tail is left? I'm confused.\n\nPerhaps in the tuple, for both directions, head and tail are given such that for the span, it's from min to max or something.\n\nLook at freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48). Direction right, so moving right, head should be increasing. Span for right-moving is [τ, h] with τ and h, and τ < h since moving right.\n\nHere head=0, tail=-47, so τ = tail = -47, h = head = 0, so span [τ, h] = [-47, 0], and since moving right, at future T, span is [-47 + sΔT, 0 + sΔT].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 4: (12, 47, left, 36). Direction left, span [h, τ] = [12, 47]? But moving left, so at future T, [12 - sΔT, 47 - sΔT].\n\nBut if moving left, and span is from 12 to 47, that's from left to right? 12 to 47, with 12 < 47, so if moving left, the car should be shifting to smaller positions, so the left end is decreasing, right end decreasing.\n\nFor example, at t_1, if span [12,47], moving left at speed 36, so after one turn, span [12-36, 47-36] = [-24,11], etc.\n\nBut for collision at position 0, we care if 0 is in the span at that turn.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like freeway 1, at t_1, span [-47,0], moving right at 48, so after ΔT, span [-47 + 48ΔT, 0 + 48ΔT].\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn T.\n\nAlso, note that when the player moves, at turn T, they are on y_T, and they choose action a_T which determines y_{T+1}, but during turn T, they are on y_T, so collision is checked for y_T at turn T.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nBut for the current position, at turn T, you are on y_T, so you can be collided by cars on y_T if 0 in span at T.\n\nIf you move to a different row, you are not on that row until the next turn.\n\nSo, to avoid collision, for each turn T, when the player is on row y, we need that for freeway y, no car has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn t_1=92, position (0,4), so y=4.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\ny from 0 to 9, freeways are y=1 to 8, so row 0 and 9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe player is at (0,4), which is on the grid, but freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=4 is a freeway with cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, always safe.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so when y=9, it's safe.\n\nNow, actions: U, D, S to change y.\n\nI need min H and sequence to go from y=4 to y=9 in H turns, avoiding collisions on the way.\n\nSince we can move up or down, but we want to go up to 9, so probably mostly U, but need to avoid cars at certain times.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars for each freeway at turn t_1=92.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): one car: (head, tail, dir, speed) = (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nSince dir right, span at t_1 is [tail, head] = [-47, 0]\n\nMoving right at speed 48.\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): two cars: (-36, -47, right, 12) and (36, 25, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: dir right, so span [tail, head] = [-47, -36]? Head and tail: the tuple is (head, tail, dir, speed), so for first car: head=-36, tail=-47, dir right.\n\nFor right dir, span is [τ, h] = [tail, head] = [-47, -36]\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=36, tail=25, dir right, span [tail, head] = [25, 36]\n\nBut tail=25, head=36, so if moving right, tail should be left, head right, so [25,36] with 25<36, yes.\n\nBut at t_1, span [25,36] for second car.\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): same as freeway 2? Cars: (-36, -47, right, 12) and (36, 25, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head=-36, tail=-47, dir right, span [-47, -36]\n\nSecond car: head=36, tail=25, dir right, span [25,36]? Tail=25, head=36, so [25,36]\n\nBut tail=25, head=36, so min is 25, max 36, but in [τ,h] for right, it should be from left to right.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 (y=4): one car? (12, 47, left, 36)\n\nDir left, so for left, span is [h, τ] = [head, tail] = [12,47]\n\nMoving left at speed 36.\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): same as freeway 4? (12, 47, left, 36)\n\nSo [12,47] moving left at 36.\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): (30, 19, right, 6)\n\nHead=30, tail=19, dir right, so span [tail, head] = [19,30]\n\nMoving right at speed 6.\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): two cars: (-12, -23, right, 4) and (52, 41, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: head=-12, tail=-23, dir right, span [tail, head] = [-23, -12]\n\nSecond car: head=52, tail=41, dir right, span [tail, head] = [41,52]\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): (-9, -20, right, 3)\n\nHead=-9, tail=-20, dir right, span [tail, head] = [-20, -9]\n\nNow, the player starts at turn t_1=92, y=4.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to go to y=9 quickly, but avoid collisions.\n\nSince we start on y=4, we need to check if at turn 92, on y=4, is there collision? That is, for freeway 4, is 0 in the span of its car at t=92.\n\nFreeway 4: car (12,47, left, 36), span [12,47] at t=92. Since moving left, at time T, span is [12 - 36(T-92), 47 - 36(T-92)]\n\nAt T=92, span [12,47], 0 is not in [12,47], since 12>0, so no collision at start.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nNow, the player can move up or down or stay.\n\nTo minimize turns, we probably want to go up as fast as possible, so mostly U actions.\n\nBut we need to avoid rows where at the time we are there, 0 is covered by a car.\n\nSince cars move, the span changes over time.\n\nFor each freeway and each future turn, we need to know if 0 is occupied at that turn.\n\nBut for collision, it depends on the exact turn when the player is on that row.\n\nLet me denote ΔT = T - t_1 = T - 92.\n\nFor each freeway, for each car, the span at time T is:\n\nFirst, freeway 1 (y=1): one car, right, speed 48, span at T: [ -47 + 48ΔT, 0 + 48ΔT ] = [48ΔT - 47, 48ΔT]\n\n0 is in span if 48ΔT - 47 <= 0 <= 48ΔT, which is equivalent to 48ΔT - 47 <= 0 and 0 <= 48ΔT, so ΔT <= 47/48 and ΔT >= 0, but since ΔT integer, ΔT=0: 48*0 -47 = -47 <=0<=0? 0<=0 true, but -47<=0 true, 0<=0 true, so at ΔT=0, 0 in span? At T=92, span [ -47, 0], so 0 is included, since it's [a,b] inclusive I assume.\n\nThe span includes the endpoints, I think, since it's a closed interval.\n\nSo for freeway 1 at T=92, span [-47,0], so position 0 is covered, so if player is on y=1 at T=92, collision.\n\nBut player starts at y=4, not on y=1.\n\nNow, 0 in span when min <= 0 <= max, so for freeway 1: min = 48ΔT - 47, max = 48ΔT\n\n0 in span iff 48ΔT - 47 <= 0 <= 48ΔT\n\nSince 48ΔT - 47 <= 0 implies ΔT <= 47/48 ≈ 0.979, so ΔT=0\n\nAnd 0 <= 48ΔT always for ΔT >=0.\n\nAt ΔT=0, 48*0 -47 = -47 <=0, and 0<=0, so yes, at ΔT=0, 0 in span.\n\nFor ΔT=1, min =48*1 -47=1, max=48, 0 not in [1,48]\n\nSimilarly for other ΔT, min larger, so only at ΔT=0, 0 in span for freeway 1.\n\nBut ΔT=0 is T=92, which is now.\n\nFor future turns, since the car moves right, 0 will not be covered again because min increases.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nNow, freeway 2 (y=2): two cars.\n\nFirst car: right, speed 12, span at T: [ -47 + 12ΔT, -36 + 12ΔT ]  (since [tail,head] = [-47,-36] at t1)\n\nSecond car: span [25 + 12ΔT, 36 + 12ΔT]  ( [25,36] at t1, moving right)\n\n0 in span for freeway 2 if 0 in first car span or in second car span.\n\nFirst car: min = -47 +12ΔT, max = -36 +12ΔT\n\n0 in iff -47+12ΔT <= 0 <= -36+12ΔT? No: min <= 0 <= max\n\nSo -47 +12ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= -36 +12ΔT? Let's write inequalities.\n\n0 in [min, max] iff min <= 0 <= max.\n\nFor first car: min <= 0 <= max\n\n-47 +12ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= -36 +12ΔT\n\nFirst: -47 +12ΔT <= 0 => 12ΔT <= 47 => ΔT <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so ΔT <=3\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 +12ΔT => 12ΔT >=36 => ΔT >=3\n\nSo for first car, 0 in span when ΔT >=3 and ΔT <=3, so only at ΔT=3.\n\nSimilarly, second car: min=25+12ΔT, max=36+12ΔT, both positive for ΔT>=0, min=25>0, so 0 < min, never <=0, so 0 not in span for second car.\n\nThus for freeway 2, only at ΔT=3, 0 is covered by first car.\n\nΔT=3 means T=92+3=95.\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): same as freeway 2? Cars: (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nFirst car: same as above, span [ -47 +12ΔT, -36 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in iff -47+12ΔT <=0 <= -36+12ΔT\n\nWhich requires ΔT <=3 and ΔT >=3, so only ΔT=3.\n\nSecond car: [25+12ΔT,36+12ΔT], min=25>0, so 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 3 has 0 covered only at ΔT=3, T=95.\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): one car, left, speed 36, span at T: [12 -36ΔT, 47 -36ΔT]  (since [h,τ] = [12,47] moving left)\n\n0 in span iff min <=0 <= max\n\nMin =12-36ΔT, max=47-36ΔT\n\n12-36ΔT <=0 <=47-36ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: 12-36ΔT <=0 => 36ΔT >=12 => ΔT >= 12/36=1/3, so ΔT >=1 since integer.\n\nSecond: 0 <=47-36ΔT => 36ΔT <=47 => ΔT <=47/36≈1.305, so ΔT<=1\n\nThus ΔT=1.\n\nAt ΔT=1, min=12-36= -24, max=47-36=11, so -24 <=0<=11, yes.\n\nAt ΔT=0, min=12>0, 0 not <= min? min=12, 0<12, not >= min, so not in.\n\nAt ΔT=2, min=12-72= -60, max=47-72= -25, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at ΔT=1, T=93, 0 covered on freeway 4.\n\nBut player starts at T=92 on y=4, which is safe, as we saw.\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): same as freeway 4? (12,47,left,36), so same, 0 covered only at ΔT=1, T=93.\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): one car (30,19,right,6)\n\nHead=30, tail=19, dir right, so span [tail,head] = [19,30] at t1, moving right.\n\nSpan at T: [19 +6ΔT, 30 +6ΔT]\n\nMin=19+6ΔT >=19>0, so always positive, 0 not in span for any ΔT.\n\nSo freeway 6 always safe.\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,4), span [tail,head] = [-23,-12] at t1, so at T: [-23 +4ΔT, -12 +4ΔT]\n\n0 in span iff min <=0 <= max\n\n-23 +4ΔT <=0 <= -12 +4ΔT\n\nFirst: -23+4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=23 => ΔT <= 23/4=5.75, so ΔT<=5\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12 +4ΔT => 4ΔT >=12 => ΔT >=3\n\nSo for first car, 0 in when ΔT >=3 and ΔT <=5, so ΔT=3,4,5.\n\nNow second car: (52,41,right,4), span [41,52] at t1, min=41>0, so 0 not in, always safe.\n\nSo for freeway 7, 0 covered when first car has it, at ΔT=3,4,5, T=95,96,97.\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): one car (-9,-20,right,3)\n\nHead=-9, tail=-20, dir right, span [tail,head] = [-20,-9] at t1.\n\nAt T: [-20 +3ΔT, -9 +3ΔT]\n\n0 in span iff min <=0 <= max\n\n-20 +3ΔT <=0 <= -9 +3ΔT\n\nFirst: -20+3ΔT <=0 => 3ΔT <=20 => ΔT <=20/3≈6.666, ΔT<=6\n\nSecond: 0 <= -9 +3ΔT => 3ΔT >=9 => ΔT >=3\n\nSo ΔT=3,4,5,6, T=95,96,97,98.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when 0 is occupied (collision if player there):\n\n- y=1: only at T=92 (ΔT=0)\n\n- y=2: only at T=95 (ΔT=3)\n\n- y=3: only at T=95 (ΔT=3)\n\n- y=4: only at T=93 (ΔT=1)\n\n- y=5: only at T=93 (ΔT=1)\n\n- y=6: never\n\n- y=7: at T=95,96,97 (ΔT=3,4,5)\n\n- y=8: at T=95,96,97,98 (ΔT=3,4,5,6)\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at T=92, y=4, which is safe.\n\nGoal: reach y=9.\n\nTo go from y=4 to y=9, minimum moves: 5 Up actions, but we might need to wait or detour to avoid collisions.\n\nSince we can move down or stay, but to minimize time, we should avoid unnecessary moves.\n\nThe critical points are when certain rows are occupied at certain times.\n\nWe need to plan the path so that when on a row, it is not occupied at that time.\n\nStart at T=92, y=4.\n\nAt T=93, y=4 will be occupied, so we must not be on y=4 at T=93.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at T=93 is also occupied.\n\nT=93: both y=4 and y=5 occupied.\n\nWe start at T=92, y=4.\n\nAt turn T, we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, we are on y_T.\n\nFor example, at T=92, we are on y=4, safe.\n\nWe choose a_92, which sets y_93.\n\nNow, at T=93, we will be on y_93, and so on.\n\nTo avoid collision at T=93 on y=4, since it's occupied, we must not be on y=4 at T=93. That means, at turn 93, we are not on row 4.\n\nSimilarly for y=5 at T=93.\n\nSince we are at y=4 at T=92, we can choose to move up, down, or stay.\n\nIf we stay (S), at T=93, we are still on y=4, but y=4 occupied at T=93, collision.\n\nIf we move down (D), to y=3 at T=93.\n\ny=3 at T=93: T=93, ΔT=1, from earlier, y=3 is occupied only at T=95, not at T=93, so y=3 is safe at T=93.\n\nSimilarly, if we move up (U), to y=5 at T=93.\n\nBut y=5 at T=93 is occupied, collision.\n\nIf we move down to y=3, safe.\n\ny=2 at T=93: ΔT=1, from above, y=2 occupied only at T=95, not at T=93, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=1 at T=93: only occupied at T=92, not T=93, so safe.\n\ny=6 at T=93: always safe.\n\nBut we are at y=4, so immediate actions.\n\nTo reach y=9 quickly, moving down might not be efficient.\n\nBut since at T=93, both y=4 and y=5 are dangerous, we must leave y=4.\n\nOptions: U to y=5: but y=5 occupied at T=93, collision.\n\nD to y=3: safe.\n\nS to y=4: occupied, collision.\n\nSo only choice is to move down to y=3 at T=93.\n\nAction a_92 = D.\n\nThen at T=93, y=3, which is safe, as y=3 not occupied at T=93.\n\nNow, from here, we need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut at T=94, we can choose to move.\n\ny=3 at T=94: ΔT=2, y=3 occupied only at T=95, not at T=94, so safe to stay or move.\n\nBut we want to go up.\n\nIf we move up to y=4 at T=94.\n\ny=4 at T=94: ΔT=2, from earlier, y=4 occupied only at T=93, not at T=94, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at T=94: ΔT=2, y=5 occupied only at T=93, not T=94, safe.\n\ny=6 always safe.\n\nBut we need to be careful at T=95, etc.\n\nLet's list the occupancy:\n\nTime T | Occupied rows\n\nT=92: y=1, y=4? y=4 at T=92 is safe, occupied only at T=93? No.\n\nT=92: occupied: y=1 (only)\n\nT=93: occupied: y=4 and y=5 (since ΔT=1)\n\nT=94: no occupied rows? Let's see:\n\ny=1: only T=92\n\ny=2: only T=95\n\ny=3: only T=95\n\ny=4: only T=93\n\ny=5: only T=93\n\ny=6: never\n\ny=7: T=95,96,97\n\ny=8: T=95,96,97,98\n\nSo at T=94, no rows are occupied, all safe.\n\nSimilarly T=95: y=2,3,7,8 occupied\n\nT=96: y=7,8\n\nT=97: y=7,8\n\nT=98: y=8\n\nT=99 and later: only if cars return, but from above, no, since all cars moving away or not covering 0 again.\n\nFor example y=8 occupied until T=98.\n\nBut y=9 always safe.\n\nNow back to player.\n\nStart T=92, y=4, safe.\n\nMust move down to avoid T=93 on y=4, so a_92 = D, to y=3 at T=93.\n\nT=93: y=3, safe (not occupied).\n\nNow at T=93, we can choose action for T=94.\n\nWe want to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y=3, we can go up to y=4, or down to y=2, or stay.\n\ny=4 at T=94: safe, as not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at T=94: safe, not occupied.\n\ny=3 at T=94: safe.\n\nBut going up is better.\n\nSo at T=93, action a_93 = U, to y=4 at T=94.\n\nT=94: y=4, safe.\n\nNow at T=94, we are on y=4, safe.\n\nWe can go up to y=5.\n\ny=5 at T=95: T=95 is future.\n\nAt T=94, we choose action for T=95.\n\nIf we go up to y=5 at T=95.\n\nBut at T=95, y=5 is occupied? y=5 occupied only at T=93, not at T=95, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at T=95: occupied only at T=93, not T=95, safe.\n\nBut we are at y=4 at T=94.\n\nAction: U to y=5 at T=95.\n\nD to y=3 at T=95, but y=3 occupied at T=95.\n\nS to y=4 at T=95, which is safe.\n\nBut we want to go up.\n\nSo a_94 = U, to y=5 at T=95.\n\nNow T=95: y=5, is it safe? y=5 occupied at T=93, not at T=95, so yes safe.\n\nBut at T=95, rows y=2,3,7,8 are occupied.\n\ny=5 not occupied, so safe.\n\nNow from y=5, we can go up to y=6.\n\ny=6 always safe.\n\nAction a_95 = U, to y=6 at T=96.\n\nT=96: y=6, safe.\n\nNow at T=96, we are on y=6.\n\nWe can go up to y=7.\n\nBut at T=96, y=7 is occupied? y=7 occupied at T=95,96,97.\n\nT=96 is ΔT=4 for y=7, which is occupied (since ΔT=3,4,5).\n\nSimilarly y=8 occupied.\n\nBut y=6 safe.\n\nIf we go up to y=7 at T=96, collision because y=7 occupied at T=96.\n\nIf we stay on y=6, safe.\n\nIf we go down, not good.\n\nSo at T=96, we cannot go to y=7 or y=8 because both occupied at T=96.\n\ny=7 and y=8 occupied at T=96.\n\nWe are on y=6 at T=96.\n\nTo avoid collision, we must not be on y=7 or y=8 at T=96.\n\nBut we are on y=6, so we can stay on y=6 or move to y=5 or y=7, but y=7 dangerous.\n\nSo actions: U to y=7: at T=96, we would be on y=7, occupied, collision.\n\nD to y=5: at T=96, y=5 not occupied (only at T=93), so safe.\n\nS to y=6: safe.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are occupied from T=95 to T=97 for y=7, T=95 to T=98 for y=8.\n\nSpecifically:\n\ny=7 occupied: T=95,96,97\n\ny=8 occupied: T=95,96,97,98\n\nAt T=96, both occupied.\n\nWe are at T=96, y=6.\n\nIf we stay on y=6 for now, safe.\n\nThen at T=97, if we go to y=7, but y=7 occupied at T=97, still dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, T=98, y=7 not occupied? y=7 occupied until T=97, so at T=98, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly y=8 occupied until T=98.\n\nT=97: y=7 and y=8 both occupied.\n\nT=98: y=8 occupied, y=7 not.\n\nT=99: no occupied.\n\nWe need to pass through y=7 and y=8 to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=6 to y=7 to y=8 to y=9.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 are occupied from T=95 to T=97 for y=7, and T=95 to T=98 for y=8.\n\nSo earliest safe time for y=7 is T=98.\n\nFor y=8, earliest safe is T=99.\n\nBut we can be on y=8 at T=99, then to y=9 at T=100.\n\nBut let's see current time.\n\nWe are at T=96, y=6.\n\nIf we stay on y=6 at T=96 (S action), then at T=97, still y=6.\n\nThen at T=97, we can choose to go to y=7 at T=98? Action at T=97 sets y for T=98.\n\nAt turn T, action a_T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nSo at time T, we are on y_T.\n\nAt T=96, we are on y=6.\n\nWe choose a_96, which sets y_97.\n\nIf a_96 = S, then y_97 =6, so at T=97, on y=6.\n\nThen at T=97, choose a_97, sets y_98.\n\nIf a_97 = U, then y_98 =7, so at T=98, on y=7.\n\nNow, y=7 at T=98: occupied? y=7 occupied at T=95,96,97, not at T=98 (since ΔT=6, not in 3,4,5), so safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=8 at T=99, etc.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nBack to T=96.\n\nOptions:\n\n- If we go up to y=7 at T=97? a_96 = U, then y_97 =7, so at T=97, on y=7.\n\nBut y=7 occupied at T=97, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\n- If we go down to y=5 at T=97: a_96 = D, y_97=5.\n\nAt T=97, y=5: not occupied (only T=93), safe.\n\nBut we are going down, away from goal.\n\nNot efficient.\n\n- Stay at y=6: a_96 = S, y_97=6, at T=97 on y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=97, we can go up to y=7 at T=98: a_97 = U, y_98=7.\n\nAt T=98, on y=7, which is safe (not occupied).\n\nThen from there, to y=8.\n\ny=8 at T=98: occupied? y=8 occupied at T=95,96,97,98? ΔT=6 for T=98, since ΔT=T-92, T=98, ΔT=6.\n\ny=8 occupied when ΔT=3,4,5,6, so T=95,96,97,98.\n\nAt T=98, ΔT=6, which is included, so occupied.\n\nThus at T=98, y=8 is occupied.\n\nSo if we go to y=7 at T=98, safe, but then to go to y=8, at T=99.\n\nAt T=98, we are on y=7.\n\nChoose a_98, sets y_99.\n\nIf a_98 = U, to y=8 at T=99.\n\nAt T=99, on y=8.\n\ny=8 at T=99: ΔT=7, occupied only up to ΔT=6, T=98, so at T=99, not occupied, safe.\n\nThen to y=9: a_99 = U, to y=9 at T=100.\n\nBut let's see if we can do better.\n\nSince we are at y=6 at T=96, and we need to wait until T=98 to go to y=7 safely.\n\nBut y=7 safe at T=98.\n\nThen to y=8 at T=99, safe.\n\nTo y=9 at T=100.\n\nBut from start, let's list the turns.\n\nStart: T=92, y=4\n\na_92 = D (to avoid collision at T=93 on y=4), so to y=3 at T=93\n\nT=93, y=3\n\na_93 = U, to y=4 at T=94\n\nT=94, y=4\n\na_94 = U, to y=5 at T=95\n\nT=95, y=5\n\na_95 = U, to y=6 at T=96\n\nT=96, y=6\n\nNow at T=96, we cannot go up immediately because y=7 occupied until T=97.\n\nSo we need to stay or move.\n\nIf we stay: a_96 = S, to y=6 at T=97\n\nT=97, y=6\n\nThen a_97 = U, to y=7 at T=98\n\nT=98, y=7 (safe)\n\nThen a_98 = U, to y=8 at T=99\n\nT=99, y=8 (safe, since T=99 not occupied)\n\nThen a_99 = U, to y=9 at T=100\n\nAt T=100, y=9, goal reached.\n\nH = number of turns from t_1 to when we reach y=9.\n\nt_1=92, we start at turn t_1.\n\nSequence of actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9.\n\nIn this case, at T=100, y=9, so turn 100.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 100, t_1=92, so 92 + H -1 =100, thus H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions from t=92 to t=99, 8 actions? Let's index.\n\nTurns: action at t determines next y.\n\nAction at turn T affects y_{T+1}.\n\nBut in the sequence, we list actions from t_1 onwards.\n\nAt turn t_1, we take action a_{t_1}, which sets y_{t_1 +1}? No.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, action a_t determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThus, the state at time t+1 depends on action at t.\n\nThe position at turn t is given, then we choose action a_t to go to turn t+1.\n\nIn the beginning, at turn t_1, position is given, we choose a_{t_1} to go to t_1 +1, and so on.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9) at some turn, say T_final.\n\nThe position at turn T_final should be (0,9).\n\nAnd we need min H such that after H actions, we are at (0,9).\n\nSince we start at turn t_1, after k actions, we are at turn t_1 + k.\n\nAt turn t_1, we have position, no action yet? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions: {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter these H actions, the player should be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBecause: after action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1 +1, position y_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H-1}, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nIn the path above, at T=100, y=9, which is turn t_1 + 8, since t_1=92, 92+8=100.\n\nt_1 + H = 100, t_1=92, so H=8.\n\nActions from t=92 to t=99, that's 8 actions? t=92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99: that's 8 actions.\n\nList:\n\nAction at t=92: a92\n\nAt t=93: a93\n\n...\n\nAt t=99: a99\n\nThen at turn t=100, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have H actions, from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nIn this case, H=8, actions at t=92 to t=99.\n\nNow in the path:\n\nt=92: a92 = D, to y=3 at t=93\n\nt=93: a93 = U, to y=4 at t=94\n\nt=94: a94 = U, to y=5 at t=95\n\nt=95: a95 = U, to y=6 at t=96\n\nt=96: a96 = S, to y=6 at t=97 (stay)\n\nt=97: a97 = U, to y=7 at t=98\n\nt=98: a98 = U, to y=8 at t=99\n\nt=99: a99 = U, to y=9 at t=100\n\nAt t=100, y=9, done.\n\nBut at t=99, we are at y=8, then a99=U to y=9 at t=100.\n\nIs this minimal?\n\nWe have to wait at y=6 for one turn because y=7 and y=8 are occupied.\n\nCan we avoid that?\n\nFor example, at t=95, we are at y=5.\n\nInstead of going up to y=6, we could go down or something, but that might take longer.\n\nAt t=95, y=5, safe.\n\nWe could stay on y=5 or go down, but not helpful.\n\nGo to y=6 at t=96, as above.\n\nBut at t=96, y=6, instead of staying, could we go down to y=5?\n\nBut y=5 is safe at t=96, but then we are lower.\n\nFor example, if at t=95, we stay on y=5: a95=S, then at t=96, y=5.\n\nThen at t=96, we can go to y=6 at t=97.\n\nBut at t=97, y=6, then to y=7 at t=98, same as before, but we are one turn behind.\n\nt=95: y=5\n\nIf a95=S, then t=96: y=5\n\na96=U, to y=6 at t=97\n\nt=97: y=6\n\na97=U, to y=7 at t=98? But at t=98, y=7 safe, but we reach later.\n\nCompared to going to y=6 at t=96, then staying or moving.\n\nIn the first path, we are at y=6 at t=96, stay at t=96 to t=97, then up.\n\nIf we go to y=6 at t=96, and at t=96 we could go to y=7, but occupied.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 is always safe, we could go to y=6 earlier and wait there until y=7 is safe.\n\nIn the current path, we reach y=6 at t=96.\n\nWe can go to y=6 earlier?\n\nIn the beginning, we had to go down to y=3 at t=93.\n\nFrom t=93 y=3, we went up to y=4 at t=94, etc.\n\nAt t=93, y=3, we could go up to y=4 at t=94, or directly to y=5? No, one action per turn.\n\nFrom y=3, at t=93, we can only go to y=2,3,4 at t=94.\n\ny=2 at t=94: safe.\n\nBut y=2 will be occupied at t=95, so if we go to y=2 at t=94, then at t=95, if we are there, collision.\n\nLet's see.\n\nAt t=93, y=3.\n\nAction: if a93=U, to y=4 at t=94 (as before)\n\nIf a93=D, to y=2 at t=94\n\nAt t=94, y=2.\n\ny=2 at t=94: not occupied, safe.\n\nBut at t=95, y=2 will be occupied, so we must leave before t=95.\n\nAt t=94, we are on y=2.\n\nWe can choose to go up to y=3 or y=1 or stay, but y=3 at t=95 occupied.\n\ny=1 at t=95: y=1 only occupied at t=92, not later, so safe.\n\nBut y=1 is low, not helpful.\n\nGo to y=3 at t=95, but y=3 occupied at t=95, collision.\n\nSo if we go to y=2 at t=94, then at t=94, we must go to y=1 or y=3, but y=3 dangerous at t=95, or to y=1.\n\nSay a94=U to y=3? But at t=95 on y=3, collision.\n\na94=D to y=1 at t=95.\n\ny=1 at t=95: not occupied, safe.\n\nBut now at y=1, we need to go up, which takes more time.\n\nFor example, from y=1 to y=2, but y=2 occupied at t=95, so wait or something.\n\nThis seems inefficient.\n\nBetter to go up early as in first path.\n\nAnother point: at t=95, we are at y=5.\n\ny=5 is safe at t=95.\n\nWe can stay on y=5 for multiple turns? But we need to go up.\n\nSince y=6 always safe, we can go to y=6 at t=96 as before.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, we need to minimize the waiting.\n\nIn the first path, we have to wait at y=6 for t=96 to t=97.\n\nCan we be on y=7 at an earlier safe time?\n\nEarliest safe for y=7 is t=98, as above.\n\nt=98 is the first safe turn for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 safe at t=99.\n\nIn the sequence, we reach y=7 at t=98, y=8 at t=99, y=9 at t=100.\n\nNow, from start, we used actions to go down first, which cost one turn.\n\nBut we had to, to avoid collision at t=93.\n\nIs there a way to go up immediately?\n\nAt t=92, y=4.\n\nIf we go up to y=5 at t=93, but at t=93, y=5 occupied, collision.\n\nGo down to y=3, as we did.\n\nStay, collision.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nThus, the first path seems optimal.\n\nH=8, with the sequence above.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nTurn t_1 =92: action a_{92} = D\n\nThen position at t=93: y=3\n\nt=93: a_{93} = U, to y=4 at t=94\n\nt=94: a_{94} = U, to y=5 at t=95\n\nt=95: a_{95} = U, to y=6 at t=96\n\nt=96: a_{96} = S, to y=6 at t=97? a_{96} = S, then y_{97} = y_{96} + 0 = y=6\n\nAt t=97, y=6\n\nThen a_{97} = U, to y=7 at t=98\n\nAt t=98, y=7\n\na_{98} = U, to y=8 at t=99\n\nAt t=99, y=8\n\na_{99} = U, to y=9 at t=100\n\nNow, at t=100, y=9, reached.\n\nThe actions are from t=92 to t=99.\n\nIn the sequence: a_{92} to a_{99}, that's 8 actions.\n\nH=8.\n\nBut we can write the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nFirst, we need to make sure about freeway 6, which we used.\n\ny=6 always safe, no issue.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=96, we stayed, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly without staying, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother idea: at t=95, we are at y=5.\n\nInstead of going to y=6 at t=96, we could go to y=4 or something, but not helpful.\n\nOr stay on y=5 at t=96.\n\nAt t=95, if a95=S, then at t=96, y=5.\n\nThen at t=96, we can go to y=6 at t=97.\n\nThen at t=97, y=6, then to y=7 at t=98, same as before, but we reached y=6 later, so worse.\n\nIn the first way, we are at y=6 at t=96, then wait one turn, then go.\n\nIf we go to y=6 earlier, but we can't because of the initial down move.\n\nFor example, at t=93, y=3, we went to y=4 at t=94.\n\nBut y=4 at t=94 is safe, and we go to y=5 at t=95.\n\nWe could go from y=3 to y=6 directly? No, each action changes by at most 1.\n\nSo must go step by step.\n\nThus, the sequence seems minimal.\n\nH=8 turns? H is the number of actions, but the turns from start to end.\n\nStart turn t_1=92, end turn 100, so 8 actions.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose at t=92, go down to y=3 at t=93.\n\nThen at t=93, instead of up, go down to y=2 at t=94? But then we have to go down further or wait.\n\nAt t=94, y=2, must go to y=1 or y=3, but y=3 occupied at t=95, so to y=1 at t=95.\n\nThen at t=95, y=1, go up to y=2 at t=96? But y=2 not occupied at t=96, only at t=95.\n\ny=2 occupied at t=95, not before or after.\n\nAt t=95, y=2 occupied, so if we go to y=2 at t=96, safe.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=95, a95=U to y=2 at t=96.\n\nAt t=96, y=2, safe (not occupied).\n\nThen go up to y=3 at t=97, y=3 not occupied (only t=95), safe.\n\nThen to y=4 at t=98, etc. But this takes more turns to go up from low position.\n\nFor example, to reach y=9, it would be later than t=100.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, the first path is better.\n\nSo H=8.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = D\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: a_{t_1 +2} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: a_{t_1 +3} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 4: a_{t_1 +4} = S  (since t_1 +4 =96, action at 96 is S)\n\nt_1=92, t_1 +4 =96, yes.\n\nThen Turn t_1 +5: a_{97} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +6: a_{98} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +7: a_{99} = U\n\nAnd we reach at t=100.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1 for the index.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + (H-1): a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nIn this case, H=8, so actions at t_1 to t_1 +7.\n\nt_1 +7 = 92+7=99, yes.\n\nNow, actions:\n\nFor t_1=92: D\n\nt_1 +1 =93: U\n\nt_1 +2=94: U\n\nt_1 +3=95: U\n\nt_1 +4=96: S\n\nt_1 +5=97: U\n\nt_1 +6=98: U\n\nt_1 +7=99: U\n\nNow, in the sequence, at t_1 +4=96, we have S, which is stay.\n\nIs there a way without staying? For example, if we can be on y=7 at t=98 directly, but we have to go through y=6.\n\nSince y=6 is safe, and we need to wait, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps at t=95, we are at y=5, we could go down to y=4, but not helpful.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 8.\n\nNow, to write in box.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 3 and 5, same as 2 and 4, but we didn't use them directly.\n\nIn the path, we were on y=3 at t=93, which is freeway 3, but at t=93, not occupied, so safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think ok.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 92\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the player must navigate around the occupied times for each freeway. The occupancy of position 0 on each freeway at future turns is derived from the car movement rules and initial states:\n\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Occupied only at turn 92.\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Occupied only at turn 95.\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Occupied only at turn 95.\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Occupied only at turn 93.\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Occupied only at turn 93.\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Never occupied.\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Occupied at turns 95, 96, 97.\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Occupied at turns 95, 96, 97, 98.\n\nThe player starts at turn 92 on \\(y=4\\), which is safe since freeway 4 is not occupied at turn 92. However, to avoid collision on \\(y=4\\) at turn 93, the player must move down to \\(y=3\\) at turn 93. From there, the player moves up to \\(y=4\\) at turn 94 and \\(y=5\\) at turn 95, both safe as these freeways are unoccupied at those turns. At turn 95, the player moves up to \\(y=6\\), which is always safe. Since freeways 7 and 8 are occupied until turn 97 and turn 98, respectively, the player stays on \\(y=6\\) at turn 96 to wait. Then, the player moves up to \\(y=7\\) at turn 98 (safe as freeway 7 is unoccupied), to \\(y=8\\) at turn 99 (safe as freeway 8 is unoccupied), and finally to \\(y=9\\) at turn 100.\n\nThe sequence of actions from turn 92 to turn 99 (8 actions) ensures the player reaches \\(y=9\\) at turn 100. This is minimal, as any attempt to reach \\(y=9\\) earlier would result in a collision due to the occupancy constraints, particularly the need to avoid \\(y=4\\) and \\(y=5\\) at turn 93 and the occupancy of \\(y=7\\) and \\(y=8\\) from turns 95 to 98.\n\n**Minimal Number of Turns \\(H = 8\\)**\n\n**Sequence of Actions:**\n- Action at turn \\(t_1 = 92\\): Move down (D) to avoid collision on \\(y=4\\) at turn 93.\n- Action at turn \\(t_1 + 1 = 93\\): Move up (U) to \\(y=4\\).\n- Action at turn \\(t_1 + 2 = 94\\): Move up (U) to \\(y=5\\).\n- Action at turn \\(t_1 + 3 = 95\\): Move up (U) to \\(y=6\\).\n- Action at turn \\(t_1 + 4 = 96\\): Stay (S) to avoid collision on \\(y=7\\) and \\(y=8\\) at turn 96 and 97.\n- Action at turn \\(t_1 + 5 = 97\\): Move up (U) to \\(y=7\\) (safe at turn 98).\n- Action at turn \\(t_1 + 6 = 98\\): Move up (U) to \\(y=8\\) (safe at turn 99).\n- Action at turn \\(t_1 + 7 = 99\\): Move up (U) to \\(y=9\\) at turn 100.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 92: D \\\\\nTurn 93: U \\\\\nTurn 94: U \\\\\nTurn 95: U \\\\\nTurn 96: S \\\\\nTurn 97: U \\\\\nTurn 98: U \\\\\nTurn 99: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. Each turn, I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but I have to stay within 0 to 9.\n\nThe cars are moving, and I need to avoid being on a row where a car is present at position x=0 at the exact turn when I'm on that row. Importantly, if I move to a new row at turn T, I'm not considered on that new row until the next turn, so I only care about the row I'm on at each turn.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=93. I need to find actions from t=93 onwards for H turns until I reach y=9.\n\nFirst, I should figure out where the cars are at each future turn relative to x=0. Since collision happens only if 0 is within the car's span at the turn when I'm on that freeway.\n\nThe car positions are given at t=93, and they move with constant speed. For left-moving cars, the span decreases, for right-moving, it increases.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, (h=48, τ=1, d=right, s=48). Since it's right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [1,48] at t=93. Then at time T, span is [τ + s*(T-t), h + s*(T-t)] = [1 + 48*(T-93), 48 + 48*(T-93)]\n\nCollision if 0 is in [1 + 48Δ, 48 + 48Δ] where Δ = T - 93.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut I need when 0 is in the span for each car.\n\nFor freeway 1, car: 0 in [1 + 48Δ, 48 + 48Δ]\n\nSince 48Δ is multiple of 48, and 1 to 48, 0 is less than 1 for all Δ, so never in [1+48Δ, 48+48Δ] because min is 1+48Δ >=1 >0 for Δ>=0. Δ=T-93 >=0.\n\n1 + 48Δ >=1 >0, so 0 is never in this interval. So no collision possible on freeway 1? But let's see the span: at Δ=0, [1,48], 0 not included. As Δ increases, the span moves right, so left end increases, always greater than 1, so 0 never in span. So freeway 1 is always safe? But the tail is 1, head 48, right-moving, so at x=0, it was never there or something. At T=93, x from 1 to 48, all positive, moving right, so x=0 never occupied. Yes, so freeway 1 has no car at x=0 ever. So I can be on freeway 1 at any time without collision.\n\nBut I need to check all freeways.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24, -35, right, 12) — tail and head? For right-moving, span is [τ, h] so τ is left, h is right? In the table, it says (head, tail, direction, speed), but for direction, it should specify which is head and tail.\n\nIn the car update, for left-moving: span [h, τ] and h decreases? Let's read carefully.\n\n\"Car update rules: For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t1\"\n\nThen for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nBut [h, τ] with h and τ, which one is left or right? Typically for left-moving, head is left, tail is right? Let's see the example.\n\nIn the span definition, for left-moving, it says Span(t1) = [h, τ] and then moves left.\n\nBut in the collision, we care about the interval containing x=0.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nSo for right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ being the left end, h the right end, since it increases.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, span [h, τ] with h left, τ right, since it decreases.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, it's given as (h, τ, left, s), so h is head, which for left-moving should be the front, so left end.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head is right end.\n\nIn freeway 2: first car: (-24, -35, right, 12) — but direction right, so for right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? τ and h are given as head and tail.\n\nLet's read the table: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nThen for right-moving, span is [τ, h] as per update rule.\n\nIn this case, first car on freeway 2: head h=-24, tail τ=-35, direction right, speed 12.\n\nSo for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nThen at T, span [ -35 + 12*(T-t1), -24 + 12*(T-t1) ]\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 2: (48, 37, right, 12) — head=48, tail=37, direction right, so span at t1: [τ, h] = [37,48]\n\nAt T: [37 + 12Δ, 48 + 12Δ] with Δ=T-t1\n\nNow, collision if 0 in the span for this freeway at time T.\n\nFor first car: 0 in [ -35 +12Δ, -24 +12Δ ]\n\n-35 +12Δ <= 0 <= -24 +12Δ\n\nSimilarly for second car: 0 in [37+12Δ, 48+12Δ]\n\nBut 37+12Δ >=37 >0 for Δ>=0, so never <=0, so 0 not in [37+12Δ,48+12Δ] since min is 37+12Δ >=37>0.\n\nSo only first car can have 0 in span.\n\n-35 +12Δ <= 0 <= -24 +12Δ\n\nSolve inequalities:\n\n-35 +12Δ <= 0 => 12Δ <=35 => Δ <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so Δ <=2 since integer turns? T and Δ are integers, I assume, since turns are discrete.\n\nT is turn number, so integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -24 +12Δ => 12Δ >=24 => Δ >=2\n\nAnd from left: -35 +12Δ <=0 => 12Δ <=35 => Δ <= 2.916, so Δ <=2 since integer.\n\nΔ <=2 and Δ >=2, so Δ=2.\n\nFor Δ=2: -35 +12*2 = -35+24= -11 <=0, and -24+12*2= -24+24=0, so 0 <=0, so yes, 0 in [-11,0] which includes 0.\n\nAt Δ=2, T=t1+2=95, span is [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], so 0 is included.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nFor Δ=1: -35+12= -23, -24+12= -12, so [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nΔ=3: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=95, for freeway 2, first car has span including 0.\n\nSecond car never.\n\nSo on freeway 2, collision possible only at T=95.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"3 | (−24,−35,right,12),(48,37,right,12) \"\n\nIdentical to freeway 2? So same, collision only at T=95.\n\nBut freeway 3 is different row, but same car positions.\n\nNow freeway 4: \"4 | (−24,11,left,36) \"\n\nOne car, head h=-24, tail τ=11, direction left, speed 36.\n\nFor left-moving, span at t1: [h, τ] = [-24, 11]\n\nThen at T: [h - sΔ, τ - sΔ] = [-24 -36Δ, 11 -36Δ] with Δ=T-t1\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -24 -36Δ, 11 -36Δ ]\n\nSince left-moving, the interval is decreasing.\n\n0 >= -24 -36Δ and 0 <= 11 -36Δ\n\nFirst, 0 <= 11 -36Δ => 36Δ <=11 => Δ <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so Δ <=0\n\nBut Δ >=0, so Δ=0: at T=t1, span [-24,11], 0 in [-24,11]? -24 <=0<=11, yes 0 is between -24 and 11.\n\nAt Δ=0, T=93, span is [-24,11], which includes 0.\n\nNow for Δ>0: Δ=1, span [-24-36, 11-36] = [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=93, 0 is in span for freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as freeway 4? \"5 | (−24,11,left,36) \" identical, so collision at T=93 only.\n\nNow freeway 6: \"(36,25,right,6)\" head=36, tail=25, direction right, speed 6.\n\nRight-moving, span at t1: [τ, h] = [25,36]\n\nAt T: [25 +6Δ, 36 +6Δ]\n\nMin is 25+6Δ >=25>0, so never <=0, so 0 never in span.

At T=93, for y=2, we have collision only at T=95, not at 93. Similarly y=3 safe at 93? y=3 collision only at T=95, not at 93.\n\ny=3 at T=93: from above, freeway 3 has cars, but collision only at T=95, so at T=93, no collision on y=3.\n\nSimilarly, y=4: unsafe at T=93, because collision.\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=93.\n\ny=6: safe\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=95,96,97, but at T=93? At T=93, for y=7, first car span [-19,-8], -19<=0<=-8? -19 <=0 is true, 0<= -8? 0 <= -8 is false, -8 is negative, 0 > -8, so 0 not <= -8, so 0 not in [-19,-8] because upper bound is -8 <0. So at T=93, span [-19,-8], all negative, 0 not in. Similarly, other times only unsafe at 95-97.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at T=93: span [-17,-6], all negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\ny=9: no cars, always safe, I assume, since freeways only 1-8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are boundaries, no cars, I think safe.\n\nThe grid is y=0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 no cars, so safe.\n\nNow, back to T=93:\n\nUnsafe rows: y=4 and y=5 at T=93.\n\nI am at y=3, safe.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions.\n\nStart: t=93, y=3\n\nI need to reach y=9 asap.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf I go U, to y=4 at t=94? No.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, I choose action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nSo at t=93, y=3, I choose a_{93}, which determines y_{94}.\n\nThen at t=94, I am at y_{94}, and so on.\n\nCollision at time T if when I am on row y at time T, and that row has a car with 0 in span at T.\n\nFor row y at time T.\n\nNow, for future times, we have unsafe times for each row.\n\nLet me make a table of unsafe (y,T) pairs.\n\nFrom above:\n\n- y=4: unsafe at T=93 only? At T=93, yes, but at other times? For y=4, only one car, and we saw only at Δ=0, T=93, 0 in span. For T>93, span moves left, all negative, so only unsafe at T=93.\n\nSimilarly y=5: only unsafe at T=93.\n\ny=2: unsafe only at T=95\n\ny=3: unsafe only at T=95 (since same as y=2)\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=95,96,97\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=95,96,97,98\n\ny=1,6,9,0 always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from (t=93, y=3) to some (t, y=9) with min H.\n\nH is number of turns, so from t=93 to t=93+H-1, y reaches 9.\n\nSet t=93 as time 0 for simplicity. Let τ = T - 93, so τ=0 at start.\n\nThen:\n\nAt τ=0: y=3\n\nUnsafe points:\n\n- y=4 at τ=0\n\n- y=5 at τ=0\n\n- y=2 at τ=2 (T=95)\n\n- y=3 at τ=2\n\n- y=7 at τ=2,3,4 (T=95,96,97)\n\n- y=8 at τ=2,3,4,5 (T=95 to 98)\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9 at some τ.\n\nMin τ such that I can be at y=9.\n\nSince I move at most +1 per turn, to go from y=3 to y=9, need at least 6 steps up, so min τ=6 if I go up every time.\n\nBut I might need to delay or go down to avoid unsafe points.\n\nFirst, can I go directly up?\n\nStart τ=0, y=3, safe.\n\nAction: if I go U, to y=4 at next time.\n\nAt τ=0, I am at y=3.\n\nAfter action, at time τ+1, I am at new y.\n\nLet’s sequence:\n\nAt τ=0: position y=3, safe.\n\nI choose action for next position.\n\nIf a=U, then at τ=1, y=4.\n\nBut at τ=1, what is state of y=4?\n\nAt τ=1, T=94.\n\nIs y=4 unsafe at τ=1?\n\nFor y=4, car: only unsafe at τ=0, as we said. At τ=1, span [-24-36,11-36]=[-60,-25], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at τ=1: span [-24-36,11-36]=[-60,-25] for both? y=5 same, safe at τ=1.\n\nSo at τ=1, if I go to y=4, it is safe.\n\nThen from y=4 at τ=1, I can go U to y=5 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=5: is it safe?\n\ny=5 at τ=2: unsafe? But y=5 unsafe only at τ=0, at τ=2 it should be safe.\n\nAt τ=2, T=95, for y=5, car span [-24-36*2, 11-36*2] = [-24-72,11-72]=[-96,-61], all negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=5 at τ=2, safe.\n\nBut at τ=2, other rows are unsafe, but I am on y=5.\n\ny=5 is safe at τ=2.\n\nThen from y=5 at τ=2, I can go U to y=6 at τ=3.\n\ny=6 always safe.\n\nThen to y=7 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=7: unsafe? y=7 unsafe at τ=2,3,4.\n\nτ=4 is T=97, which is unsafe for y=7.\n\nSo at τ=4, if I am on y=7, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf I go directly:\n\nτ=0: y=3, action U, to y=4 at τ=1\n\nτ=1: y=4, action U, to y=5 at τ=2\n\nτ=2: y=5, action U, to y=6 at τ=3\n\nτ=3: y=6, action U, to y=7 at τ=4\n\nAt τ=4, y=7, but y=7 unsafe at τ=4 (since T=97, unsafe as per earlier).\n\nSo collision.\n\nIf at τ=3, y=6, I stay or go down, but I need to go up.\n\nSince y=7 unsafe at τ=4, I need to not be on y=7 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, if I am on y=7, unsafe.\n\nI could be on y=6 or y=8 or other at τ=4.\n\nBut I am coming from y=6 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=6, I can choose to stay or go up or down.\n\nIf I go up to y=7 at τ=4, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, at τ=4 y=6, which is safe.\n\nBut then I need to go up later.\n\nIf I go down to y=5 at τ=4, y=5 is safe at τ=4, but then I have to come back, takes more time.\n\nSince y=7 is unsafe at τ=2,3,4, I need to avoid being on y=7 at those times.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 unsafe at τ=2,3,4,5.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, I need to pass through y=7 or y=8, but both have unsafe times.\n\ny=7 unsafe τ=2,3,4; y=8 unsafe τ=2,3,4,5.\n\nNow, safe times for y=7: τ=0,1,5,6,... but at τ=0 and τ=1, what is y=7?\n\nAt τ=0, T=93, y=7: as earlier, span [-19,-8] for first car, 0 not in, safe. Second car safe.\n\nSimilarly τ=1, T=94, span [-19+4, -8+4] for first car? Δ=1, T=94, span [-19+4(1), -8+4(1)] = [-15,-4], 0 not in, safe.\n\nτ=5, T=98, for y=7, at τ=5, Δ=5, span [-19+20, -8+20]= [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, τ=6, [ -19+24, -8+24]=[5,16], safe, etc.\n\nSo y=7 safe at τ=0,1,5,6,...\n\nSimilarly y=8: unsafe τ=2,3,4,5\n\nSafe at τ=0,1,6,7,...\n\nAt τ=0, T=93, y=8: span [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nτ=1, T=94, span [-17+3, -6+3]= [-14,-3], 0 not in, safe.\n\nτ=6, T=99, span [-17+18, -6+18]= [1,12], safe.\n\nτ=7, [ -17+21, -6+21]= [4,15], safe.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI need to go from y=3 at τ=0 to y=9.\n\nSince min steps is 6, but at τ=4, if I go to y=7, it is unsafe.\n\nτ=4 is too early for y=7.\n\nI could delay or take a different path.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, y=3, instead of going up, I could go down or stay, but that might not help.\n\nSince y=7 is safe at τ=5, for example.\n\nList possible times to be on each row safely.\n\ny=3: safe except at τ=2\n\ny=4: safe except at τ=0\n\ny=5: safe except at τ=0\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: safe except τ=2,3,4\n\ny=8: safe except τ=2,3,4,5\n\ny=9: always safe\n\nI need to have a sequence y_τ for τ=0,1,2,... with y_0=3, and |y_{τ+1} - y_τ| <=1, and reach y=9 asap, and for each τ, y_τ not unsafe at that τ.\n\nSince I start at τ=0, y=3, safe.\n\nI need to avoid y=4 and y=5 at τ=0, but I'm not there.\n\nNow, at τ=0, I can choose to go to y=2,3, or4.\n\nIf I go to y=4 at τ=1? Action at τ=0 determines y at τ=1.\n\nDefine y_τ as position at time τ.\n\ny_0 = 3\n\nThen for each step, I choose Δy = -1,0,1, so y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy\n\nAnd y_{τ+1} between 0 and 9.\n\nThen for each τ, (y_τ, τ) must be safe.\n\nNow, min τ such that y_τ=9.\n\nSince I need to increase from 3 to 9, min τ is 6 if possible.\n\nBut at τ=4, if y_4=7, it is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if y_4=8, unsafe; y_4=6, safe, but y=6 at τ=4 is fine, but I need to go to y=9 from there.\n\nBut from y=6, to y=9, need 3 up, so at τ=7 y=9.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach earlier.\n\ny_τ=9 at τ=6: that would require y_0=3, and increase by 1 each step to y_6=9.\n\nBut let's see the path:\n\nτ=0: y=3, safe\n\nτ=1: y=4, safe (as earlier)\n\nτ=2: y=5, safe? At τ=2, y=5 is safe, as we said.\n\nτ=3: y=6, safe\n\nτ=4: y=7, but unsafe at τ=4\n\nConflict.\n\nIf at τ=3 y=6, I stay, so y_4=6, safe, then at τ=4 y=6, I can go U to y=7 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, y=7: is it safe?\n\ny=7 at τ=5: τ=5, T=98, for y=7, earlier we have unsafe at τ=2,3,4, but τ=5: at T=98, Δ=5, span [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 safe at τ=5.\n\nThen from y=7 at τ=5, I can go U to y=8 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, y=8: is it safe?\n\ny=8 unsafe at τ=2,3,4,5.\n\nτ=5 is unsafe, τ=6: at τ=6, T=99, for y=8, span [ -17+3*6, -6+3*6] = [-17+18, -6+18] = [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nτ=6 is safe for y=8.\n\nThen from y=8 at τ=6, to y=9 at τ=7.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nNow, y_τ:\n\nτ=0: y=3\n\nτ=1: y=4 (after action at τ=0, U)\n\nτ=2: y=5 (U)\n\nτ=3: y=6 (U)\n\nτ=4: y=6 (S, stay)\n\nτ=5: y=7 (U from y=6)\n\nτ=6: y=8 (U)\n\nτ=7: y=9 (U)\n\nSo at τ=7, y=9.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, from τ=0 to τ=7, that's 8 turns? Let's see.\n\nTime: at start τ=0, turn t=93, position y=3.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t=93 + H - 1, y=9.\n\nIn terms of τ, at time τ, it is after τ steps from start.\n\nAt τ=0, turn 93.\n\nAfter one action, at τ=1, turn 94, and so on.\n\nSo y_τ is position at turn 93 + τ.\n\nWe need y_τ =9 for some τ.\n\nIn this case, at τ=7, y=9, so turn 93+7=100.\n\nNumber of actions: from τ=0 to τ=6, I take actions to reach y_7 at τ=7.\n\nActions from t=93 to t=99, for H=7 actions? Let's count.\n\nStart: t=93, y=3, before any action.\n\nI take action a_{93} to go to y_{94}.\n\nSimilarly, a_{94} to y_{95}, ..., up to a_{99} to y_{100}.\n\nWhen y=9 at turn T, it means after the action at T-1, y_T=9.\n\nIn the sequence, I take actions from t=93 to t=93+H-1, and at turn t=93+H-1, y=9.\n\nFor example, if I reach at τ=7, turn 100, then actions from t=93 to t=99, that's 7 actions: t=93,94,95,96,97,98,99.\n\nH=7.\n\nBut earlier I thought min is 6, but not possible due to collision.\n\nIn the path above, at τ=4, I stayed at y=6.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nFor example, can I be at y=7 at τ=5 directly.\n\nIn the direct path, at τ=3 y=6, if I could go to y=7 at τ=4, but unsafe.\n\nAt τ=5, y=7 is safe.\n\nBut from y=3 to y=7 in 5 steps? y_0=3, y_5=7, that requires net +4 in 5 steps, possible with one stay or down, but I need to go to 9, so better to go up.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach y=9 earlier.\n\ny_6=9: requires y_0=3, and over 6 steps, net +6, so must go up every time, no down or stay.\n\nBut we saw that at τ=4 y=7 unsafe.\n\ny_5=9: impossible, since from y=3 to y=9 in 5 steps, min net +6, but max change per step +1, so impossible to reach in less than 6 steps. Min τ=6 for y=9.\n\nBut at τ=6, y=9 only if I go up every step, but at τ=4 y=7, which is unsafe, so impossible to be at y=9 at τ=6.\n\nTherefore, min possible τ is 7, with y=9 at τ=7.\n\nNow, in the path I have, I reached at τ=7.\n\nBut in that path, I stayed at τ=4, but perhaps I can go down or something to avoid, but it might not be faster.\n\nAnother path: suppose at τ=0, y=3, I go down to y=2 at τ=1.\n\ny=2 at τ=1: is it safe?\n\ny=2 unsafe only at τ=2, at τ=1, T=94.\n\nFor y=2, at τ=1, Δ=1, first car span [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at τ=1 y=2, I can go up to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nBut y=3 at τ=2 is unsafe! τ=2, T=95, unsafe for y=3.\n\nSo if I go to y=3 at τ=2, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt τ=1 y=2, I can stay or go down.\n\nIf stay, y=2 at τ=2, unsafe at τ=2.\n\ny=2 unsafe at τ=2, so cannot be on y=2 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 unsafe at τ=2.\n\nSo at τ=2, I must be on y=1,4,5,6,etc, but y=4 and y=5 safe at τ=2? y=4 safe, y=5 safe, y=6 safe.\n\nBut from y=2 at τ=1, I can go to y=1,2,3.\n\ny=2 and y=3 unsafe at τ=2, so I must go to y=1 at τ=2.\n\ny=1 always safe.\n\nSo at τ=1 y=2, action D to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2 y=1, safe.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up, but y=1 to y=9, need 8 more steps, which will take longer than 7.\n\nFor example, to y=9 at τ=9 or later, worse than τ=7.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=4 at τ=1, etc.\n\nBut in the first path, with stay at τ=4, I reach at τ=7.\n\nBut can I reach at τ=7 without staying?\n\nFor example, go to y=7 at τ=5, which is safe.\n\nThen y=8 at τ=6, safe, y=9 at τ=7.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut from where? I need to be at y=6 at τ=4 to go to y=7 at τ=5.\n\ny=6 at τ=4 is safe.\n\nNow, to be at y=6 at τ=4, from start y=3 at τ=0, in 4 steps, net +3, so possible with one stay or down, but I need to avoid unsafe points.\n\ny_0=3\n\ny_1: possible 2,3,4\n\ny_2: depends\n\nBut at τ=2, y cannot be 2 or 3, must be 1,4,5,6,...\n\nIf I go directly:\n\nτ=0: y=3, U to y=4 at τ=1\n\nτ=1: y=4, U to y=5 at τ=2\n\nτ=2: y=5, safe? Yes, at τ=2, y=5 safe.\n\nThen from y=5, I can go to y=6 at τ=3? Action at τ=2, to y at τ=3.\n\ny_τ position at time τ.\n\nAt τ=2, y=5, I choose action.\n\nIf U, to y=6 at τ=3.\n\nThen at τ=3 y=6, safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, I can go U to y=7 at τ=4, but unsafe.\n\nOr stay, y=6 at τ=4, safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at τ=5, safe.\n\nThen U to y=8 at τ=6, safe.\n\nU to y=9 at τ=7.\n\nSame as before.\n\nFrom y=5 at τ=2, I could go down or something, but not helpful.\n\nAt τ=0, if I stay at y=3 for τ=1.\n\ny_0=3, action S, to y=3 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=3: is it safe?\n\ny=3 unsafe only at τ=2, at τ=1, T=94.\n\nFor y=3, at τ=1, Δ=1, span for first car [-35+12, -24+12]=[-23,-12], 0 not in, safe. Second car not relevant.\n\nSo at τ=1 y=3 safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, I can go U to y=4 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=4: safe? y=4 safe except τ=0, at τ=2 safe.\n\nThen to y=5 at τ=3, safe.\n\nThen to y=6 at τ=4, safe.\n\nThen to y=7 at τ=5, safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at τ=6, safe.\n\nTo y=9 at τ=7.\n\nSame, still τ=7.\n\nAnd I have a stay at the beginning.\n\nNo better.\n\nBut in this case, at τ=4 I am at y=6, same as before.\n\nNow, another idea: since y=8 is safe at τ=6, and y=7 at τ=5, but can I go directly to higher y faster? No.\n\nPerhaps avoid y=7 and go through y=8 later.\n\nBut y=8 unsafe at τ=5, but safe at τ=6.\n\nFor example, to be at y=8 at τ=6.\n\nThen from y=8 to y=9 at τ=7.\n\nBut I need to reach y=8 at τ=6.\n\nFrom y=3 at τ=0, to y=8 at τ=6, net +5 in 6 steps, so possible with one down or stay.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\ny_0=3\n\ny_1: suppose y=4\n\ny_2: y=5 (since at τ=2, y=4 or5 or6, but y=5 safe)\n\ny_3: y=6\n\ny_4: now at τ=4, I need to be at some y.\n\nIf I go to y=7, unsafe; so must be y=6 or y=5 or y=8? y=8 at τ=4 unsafe, since τ=4 for y=8 unsafe.\n\ny=8 unsafe at τ=2,3,4,5, so τ=4 unsafe.\n\nSo at τ=4, I cannot be on y=7 or y=8, must be on y=6 or below or y=9, but y=9 too high.\n\ny=6 safe.\n\nSo y_4=6\n\nThen y_5: from y=6, I can go to y=7 at τ=5, safe, or y=6 or y=5.\n\nIf to y=7 at τ=5, safe.\n\nThen y_6: to y=8 at τ=6, safe.\n\nThen y_7: to y=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf at y_5=7, I go directly to y=9? No, must go through y=8.\n\ny_{τ+1} = y_τ ±1 or 0, so from y=7 to y=9, need two steps.\n\nSo cannot skip.\n\nThus, minimal is to reach y=9 at τ=7.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I need the actions.\n\nFrom above, one possible sequence:\n\nAt τ=0 (t=93), y=3, action U, to y=4 at τ=1\n\nτ=1 (t=94), y=4, action U, to y=5 at τ=2\n\nτ=2 (t=95), y=5, action U, to y=6 at τ=3\n\nτ=3 (t=96), y=6, action S, to y=6 at τ=4 (t=97)\n\nIn terms of turns:\n\nTurn t=93: position y=3, I choose action for next position.\n\nAfter action a_t, at turn t+1, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo:\n\nAt turn t=93: y=3, I choose a_{93} = U, so at t=94, y=4\n\nAt turn t=94: y=4, choose a_{94} = U, so at t=95, y=5\n\nAt turn t=95: y=5, choose a_{95} = U, so at t=96, y=6\n\nAt turn t=96: y=6, choose a_{96} = S, so at t=97, y=6\n\nAt turn t=97: y=6, choose a_{97} = U, so at t=98, y=7\n\nAt turn t=98: y=7, choose a_{98} = U, so at t=99, y=8\n\nAt turn t=99: y=8, choose a_{99} = U, so at t=100, y=9\n\nAnd at t=100, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, H=7 actions: from t=93 to t=99.\n\nIn the sequence, actions: a_{93} to a_{99}.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions for turns starting from t_1=93.\n\nIn the output: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to the last action before reaching.\n\nHere, from t=93 to t=99, 7 actions.\n\nBut at t=99, after action, at t=100 y=9.\n\nNow, is there a sequence with H=6? We thought not, but let me confirm.\n\nSuppose I go to y=7 at τ=5, but y=7 at τ=5 is safe, but to be at y=7 at τ=5, from y=3 at τ=0, I need net +4 in 5 steps, so possible with one down or stay.\n\nFor example:\n\nStart τ=0 y=3, action S, to y=3 at τ=1\n\nThen action U, to y=4 at τ=2\n\nBut at τ=2, y=4 safe.\n\nThen U to y=5 at τ=3\n\nU to y=6 at τ=4\n\nU to y=7 at τ=5\n\nThen at τ=5 y=7, safe.\n\nThen U to y=8 at τ=6\n\nU to y=9 at τ=7\n\nStill τ=7.\n\nFrom τ=0 y=3, U to y=4 τ=1\n\nU to y=5 τ=2\n\nThen at τ=2 y=5, instead of U, I do S, to y=5 at τ=3\n\nBut y=5 at τ=3 safe, then U to y=6 τ=4, U to y=7 τ=5, same as before.\n\nNo way to reach earlier.\n\nSince at τ=4 I have to be not on y=7, and to reach y=9 at τ=6, I need to be at y=9 at τ=6, which requires y=8 at τ=5 or y=7 at τ=4 with U, but both impossible.\n\ny=8 at τ=5 unsafe.\n\nSo indeed, min H=7.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have one with a stay at t=96.\n\nBut in the beginning, I could have different actions.\n\nFor example, at t=93, I could go down to y=2 at t=94.\n\nBut then:\n\nt=93: y=3, a_{93}=D, to y=2 at t=94\n\nt=94: y=2, now at t=94, y=2 safe (τ=1)\n\nThen action: if U to y=3 at t=95, but t=95 is τ=2, y=3 unsafe.\n\nIf S, to y=2 at t=95, unsafe.\n\nIf D, to y=1 at t=95.\n\nt=95: y=1, safe.\n\nThen from there, need to go up to y=9, which will take at least 8 more steps, to t=103 or later, worse.\n\nNot good.\n\nSimilarly, other paths seem slower or same.\n\nSo the minimal H is 7, with sequence as above.\n\nNow, in the sequence, at t=96, I used S, but I could use other actions, but not necessary.\n\nNow, to write the actions.\n\nIn the output, it should be for turns starting from t_1=93.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 93: U\n\nTurn 94: U\n\nTurn 95: U\n\nTurn 96: S\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nAnd then at turn 100, y=9.\n\nBut the actions are up to turn 99.\n\nIn the answer format, it should list the actions until the last one before reaching.\n\nH=7, from t=93 to t=99.\n\nIn the sequence, I have action at t=96 as S.\n\nBut is there a sequence without stay?\n\nFor example, at some point go down and up, but that would take more turns.\n\nSuppose at t=95, y=5, instead of going up, I go down to y=4 at t=96.\n\nt=95: y=5, action D, to y=4 at t=96.\n\nt=96: y=4, safe? At t=96, T=96, τ=3, y=4 safe.\n\nThen from y=4, I can go U to y=5 at t=97.\n\nt=97: y=5, safe.\n\nThen U to y=6 at t=98.\n\nt=98: y=6, safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at t=99.\n\nt=99: y=7, now t=99 is τ=6, T=99, y=7 safe? τ=6, earlier we said safe.\n\nThen U to y=8 at t=100.\n\nU to y=9 at t=101.\n\nBut now reached at t=101, which is later, τ=8, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nAt t=97 y=6, go directly, but same.\n\nSo the first sequence is fine.\n\nIn the first sequence, at t=96 I stayed, but I could have gone down or something, but no benefit.\n\nSo I think H=7 is minimal.\n\nNow, about freeway y=3 and y=2 at τ=2, but I avoided them.\n\nIn my sequence, I was at y=5 at τ=2, which is safe.\n\nNow, to confirm the car states quickly.\n\nFor example, at t=97, y=6, no issue.\n\nt=98, y=7: τ=5, T=98, for y=7, Δ=5 from t1=93, span [-19+20, -8+20]=[1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=99, y=8: τ=6, T=99, y=8, span [-17+18, -6+18]=[1,12], safe.\n\nt=100, y=9, safe.\n\nAnd earlier points all safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1=93.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 93: U\n\nTurn 94: U\n\nTurn 95: U\n\nTurn 96: S\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write in the format.\n\nAlso, H=7, but I think the sequence implies H.\n\nIn the answer, it says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the box, only sequence, I think.\n\n\"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} ... }\"\n\nSo I need to list the actions for turns from 93 to 99.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, but t from 0.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t=0, a_{t_1}, t=1, a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to t=H-1, a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H -1, after action, position at next turn is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, t_1=93, H=7, so actions from t=93 to t=93+6=99.\n\nt from 0 to 6: a_{93+0} to a_{93+6}, i.e., a_{93} to a_{99}.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H -1 = 93 + 7 -1 = 99, after action, at turn 100, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, sequence: U, U, U, S, U, U, U\n\nBut in order.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 93: U\n\nTurn 94: U\n\nTurn 95: U\n\nTurn 96: S\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me make sure that at t=96, when I stay, is it necessary? But in this sequence, it is.\n\nI could have a different sequence with same H.\n\nFor example, start with stay at t=93.\n\nt=93: S, to y=3 at t=94\n\nt=94: U, to y=4 at t=95? t=94: y=3, action U, to y=4 at t=95.\n\nt=95: y=4, action U, to y=5 at t=96\n\nt=96: y=5, action U, to y=6 at t=97\n\nt=97: y=6, action U, to y=7 at t=98\n\nt=98: y=7, action U, to y=8 at t=99\n\nt=99: y=8, action U, to y=9 at t=100\n\nSame H=7, actions: S, U, U, U, U, U, U\n\nBut now I have a stay at beginning, which might be similar.\n\nBut in terms of number, same.\n\nBut perhaps the first sequence has fewer downs or something, but not specified.\n\nBut in the output, both are valid, but I think the first one goes up faster initially.\n\nBut no preference, I think.\n\nIn the first sequence, at t=95 I was at y=5, which is safe, and at t=96 I stayed to avoid going to y=7 too early.\n\nBut in this second sequence, I reached y=6 at t=97, later.\n\nBut same end time.\n\nIn first: at t=96, y=6\n\nIn second: at t=96, y=5? t=96: in first sequence, after action at t=95, at t=96 y=6? Let's see:\n\nFirst sequence:\n\nt=93: a=U, to y=4 at t=94\n\nt=94: a=U, to y=5 at t=95\n\nt=95: a=U, to y=6 at t=96\n\nt=96: a=S, to y=6 at t=97\n\n...\n\nIn second sequence with stay:\n\nt=93: a=S, to y=3 at t=94\n\nt=94: a=U, to y=4 at t=95\n\nt=95: a=U, to y=5 at t=96\n\nt=96: a=U, to y=6 at t=97\n\nt=97: a=U, to y=7 at t=98\n\n...\n\nSo at t=96, in first sequence y=6, in second y=5? Positions at turn t.\n\nAt turn t=96:\n\nIn first sequence: at t=96, position y=6 (since after action at t=95)\n\nIn second sequence: at t=96, y=5 (after action at t=95)\n\nThen action at t=96: in first, S to same y=6 at t=97; in second, U to y=6 at t=97.\n\nThen both reach y=7 at t=98 or later.\n\nBut in first, at t=97 y=6, then U to y=7 at t=98.\n\nIn second, at t=97 y=6, U to y=7 at t=98.\n\nSame from there.\n\nBut in first sequence, I was at y=6 earlier, at t=96, but I stayed, so I didn't progress at t=96.\n\nIn terms of reaching y=9, both at t=100.\n\nBut in the second sequence, I have an extra \"U\" at some point, but same actions.\n\nI think both are fine.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal H is achieved, and sequence is not unique.\n\nBut in the output, I can use the first one.\n\nTo avoid stay, but I have to have a \"wait\" somewhere.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose I go to y=4 at t=94, then to y=5 at t=95, then to y=6 at t=96, then I must not go to y=7 at t=97 because t=97 is τ=4, y=7 unsafe? t=97 is T=97, τ=4, y=7 unsafe.\n\nIn my first sequence, I went to y=7 at t=98, which is τ=5, safe.\n\nIf at t=96 y=6, I go to y=7 at t=97, unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot.\n\nThus, I must have a turn where I don't go up, either stay or go down, but going down would be worse.\n\nSo stay is necessary.\n\nThus, the sequence with one stay is fine.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 93\\) is 7. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a row where a car occupies \\(x = 0\\) at the corresponding turn.\n\n- At turn 93, the player is at \\(y = 3\\). Moving up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 94 is safe, as \\(y = 4\\) is unsafe only at turn 93.\n- At turn 94, moving up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 95 is safe, as \\(y = 5\\) is unsafe only at turn 93.\n- At turn 95, moving up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 96 is safe, as \\(y = 6\\) is always safe.\n- At turn 96, staying at \\(y = 6\\) is necessary to avoid moving to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 97, as \\(y = 7\\) is unsafe at turns 95, 96, and 97.\n- At turn 97, moving up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 98 is safe, as \\(y = 7\\) is safe at turn 98 (corresponding to \\(\\tau = 5\\) from turn 93, with car span \\([1, 12]\\), excluding 0).\n- At turn 98, moving up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 99 is safe, as \\(y = 8\\) is safe at turn 99 (corresponding to \\(\\tau = 6\\), with car span \\([1, 12]\\), excluding 0).\n- At turn 99, moving up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 100 reaches the target position safely.\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y = 9\\) at turn 100 (i.e., after 7 actions from turn 93 to 99), which is minimal since reaching \\(y = 9\\) in fewer turns (e.g., 6 turns) would require moving up at every step, but this would place the player on \\(y = 7\\) at turn 97 (when it is unsafe), causing a collision.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 93: U \\\\\nTurn 94: U \\\\\nTurn 95: U \\\\\nTurn 96: S \\\\\nTurn 97: U \\\\\nTurn 98: U \\\\\nTurn 99: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 4) on turn t_1 = 94. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns H, with actions U (up), D (down), or S (stay). I need to avoid collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. When moving, at turn T, the player is on y_T, and after the action, they move to y_{T+1}, but they are not on y_{T+1} during turn T, so they only check the freeway they are currently on for collision.\n\nFrom the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, during turn T, the player is on y_T, and they might move to a different row for turn T+1, but during turn T, they are only present on y_T, so collision is only checked for freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, the car spans are given for turn t_1 = 94. For future turns, I need to compute where the cars are based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, (head=96, tail=49, direction=right, speed=48). Since it's right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nDirection right: span moves to the right as time increases. So for turn T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (head=96, tail=49, right, speed=48). But head and tail: for right-moving, head is the front, so if it's moving right, head should be larger than tail? 96 and 49, 96 > 49, so head=96, tail=49, meaning the car extends from 49 to 96, and since direction right, it's moving to increasing x.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, head is the front, so for example, freeway 4: (-60, -25, left, 36), so head=-60, tail=-25? -60 < -25, so if left-moving, head should be smaller? Let's clarify the notation.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the input, for left-moving, it says (h, τ, left, s), and span(t_1) = [h, τ]\n\nFor freeway 4: (-60, -25, left, 36), so h=-60, τ=-25. Since left-moving, at t_1, span is [h, τ] = [-60, -25]. But -60 < -25, so the car is from x=-60 to x=-25, and since left-moving, it's decreasing x, so at time T, span is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)] = [-60 - 36(T-94), -25 - 36(T-94)]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h]? No.\n\nFrom the text: \"Right-moving: [Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (96, 49, right, 48), but it says head h=96, tail τ=49, and for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [49, 96], then span(T) = [49 + 48(T-t_1), 96 + 48(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: two cars: (-12, -23, right, 12) and (60, 49, right, 12)\n\nFor first car: (-12, -23, right, 12). But for right-moving, span(t_1) should be [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head. Here τ=-23, h=-12? -23 < -12, so if τ=-23, h=-12, span [ -23, -12 ]? But it says head and tail, and direction.\n\nIn the input, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for right-moving, head should be larger, for left-moving smaller? But here for freeway 2, first car: head=-12, tail=-23, direction right. Since direction right, head is the front, so if moving right, head should be greater than tail? -12 > -23, yes, -12 is greater than -23, so tail is -23, head is -12, so the car is from -23 to -12, moving right.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (60,49,right,12), tail=49, head=60, so from 49 to 60.\n\nBut for the first car, head=-12, tail=-23, so at t_1, span [τ, h] = [-23, -12] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 4: head=-60, tail=-25, direction left. For left-moving, head is the front, which is smaller x if moving left? Let's see the update.\n\nLeft-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nWith h and τ, for freeway 4, h=-60, τ=-25, and h < τ since -60 < -25, so span [h, τ] = [-60, -25], and since left-moving, decreasing x, so at T, [ -60 -36ΔT, -25 -36ΔT ]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway k, and for that freeway, at turn T, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nThe player is on y_T at turn T, and we check if 0 is in the span for any car on row y_T at that turn T.\n\nIf the player moves vertically, at turn T they are on y_T, and after action they go to y_{T+1}, but during turn T, they are only on y_T.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=4 on turn 94.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to move up 5 units, but I can only move +1, -1, or 0 per turn, so minimum H would be 5 if I can go straight up without collision.\n\nBut there might be cars on the way, so I need to check for each row and each turn if being there causes collision.\n\nSince I need minimal H, I should try to go up as fast as possible, but avoid rows where at that turn, 0 is occupied.\n\nFirst, let's define ΔT = T - t_1 = T - 94, so for turn T, time since start.\n\nFor each freeway k, and for each car on it, I need to find when 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nFor a given car, at turn T, the span is as above, and I need 0 between the min and max of the span.\n\nSince the span is an interval, I can find for each car the times when it covers x=0.\n\nThen for each row k, the times when there is a car covering x=0 are the times to avoid if I am on that row.\n\nBut for a row, there might be multiple cars, so I need to find for each row, the set of turns T where at least one car on that row has 0 in its span.\n\nThen, when I am on a row at turn T, if that row has a car at x=0 at turn T, collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nNow, the player moves with actions U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0.\n\nStart at y=4, turn 94.\n\nGoal y=9.\n\nMinimal path: since I need to increase y by 5, min H is 5, with all U actions.\n\nBut I need to check if at each step, when I am on y, at turn T, it is safe.\n\nSince I move sequentially, for turn 94, I am at y=4.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each row, the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nLet ΔT = T - 94.\n\nFor freeway k=1:\n\nOne car: (head=96, tail=49, right, speed=48)\n\nFor right-moving, span at T: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [49 + 48 ΔT, 96 + 48 ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 49 + 48 ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 96 + 48 ΔT\n\nSince 49 + 48 ΔT ≤ 96 + 48 ΔT always, so:\n\n49 + 48 ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 96 + 48 ΔT\n\nBetter to solve inequality:\n\n49 + 48 ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 96 + 48 ΔT\n\nWhich is two parts:\n\n49 + 48 ΔT ≤ 0  => 48 ΔT ≤ -49  => ΔT ≤ -49/48 ≈ -1.0208\n\nand 0 ≤ 96 + 48 ΔT  => 48 ΔT ≥ -96  => ΔT ≥ -96/48 = -2\n\nBut ΔT = T - 94, and T ≥ 94, so ΔT ≥ 0.\n\nSince ΔT ≥ 0, let's see:\n\n49 + 48 ΔT ≤ 0: 48 ΔT ≤ -49, since ΔT ≥0, 48ΔT ≥0, -49<0, so 48ΔT ≤ -49 is impossible for ΔT ≥0. So this inequality never holds for ΔT ≥0.\n\n0 ≤ 96 + 48 ΔT: since 96 + 48ΔT ≥96 >0 for ΔT ≥0, always true.\n\nSo for the first part, 49 + 48ΔT ≤0 is false for ΔT≥0, so the inequality 49 + 48ΔT ≤0 ≤96 +48ΔT cannot hold because left part false.\n\nThus, for all ΔT ≥0, 0 is not in [49+48ΔT, 96+48ΔT] because 49+48ΔT ≥49>0, so 0 is left of left endpoint, not in interval.\n\nAt ΔT=0, span [49,96], 0 not in, yes.\n\nAs ΔT increases, span moves right, so 0 never covered. So for freeway 1, x=0 is never occupied for any T ≥ t_1. So row 1 is always safe at x=0.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-12, -23, right, 12)  // head=-12, tail=-23, direction right\n\nFor right-moving, span at T: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-23 + 12 ΔT, -12 + 12 ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -23 +12 ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -12 +12 ΔT\n\nWhich is -23 +12 ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -12 +12 ΔT\n\nFirst: -23 +12 ΔT ≤ 0 => 12 ΔT ≤ 23 => ΔT ≤ 23/12 ≈ 1.9167\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -12 +12 ΔT => 12 ΔT ≥ 12 => ΔT ≥ 1\n\nSo for ΔT between 1 and 23/12 ≈1.9167, so ΔT=1, since ΔT integer? Turn T, so ΔT integer.\n\nΔT = T - t_1, T turn number, so integer, yes.\n\nSo ΔT=1: 1 ≤ ΔT ≤ 1.9167, so ΔT=1\n\nAt ΔT=1, span: -23+12*1 = -11, -12+12*1=0? -12 +12=0\n\nSo at ΔT=1, T=94 +1=95, span [-11, 0]\n\nSo 0 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, yes, 0 is included, since endpoint.\n\nSimilarly, at ΔT=2: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=1: -23+12=-11, -12+12=0, so [ -11, 0 ], and 0 is included.\n\nSo for first car, 0 in span at ΔT=1.\n\nSecond car on freeway 2: (60,49,right,12) head=60, tail=49, right\n\nSpan at T: [49 + 12 ΔT, 60 + 12 ΔT]\n\n0 in? 49 +12ΔT ≤0 ≤60+12ΔT\n\n49+12ΔT ≤0: 12ΔT ≤ -49, ΔT ≤ -49/12 ≈ -4.083, impossible since ΔT≥0\n\n0≤60+12ΔT always true, but left part false, so never, since min is 49+12ΔT ≥49>0.\n\nSo only first car can cover x=0 at ΔT=1, T=95.\n\nThus for freeway 2, occupied at x=0 only at T=95.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"3 | (-12, -23, right, 12), (60, 49, right, 12) |\"\n\nIdentical to freeway 2. So same, occupied only at T=95.\n\nNow freeway 4: (-60, -25, left, 36)  // head=-60, tail=-25, direction left\n\nLeft-moving, span at T: [h - s ΔT, τ - s ΔT] = [-60 - 36 ΔT, -25 - 36 ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -60 -36 ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -25 -36 ΔT\n\nWhich is -60 -36ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -25 -36ΔT\n\nFirst: -60 -36ΔT ≤ 0 => -36ΔT ≤ 60 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality: 36ΔT ≥ -60, but 36ΔT ≥0 > -60, always true for ΔT≥0? No:\n\n-60 -36ΔT ≤ 0 => -36ΔT ≤ 60 => now divide by -36, reverse inequality: ΔT ≥ 60 / (-36) * (-1), let's carefully:\n\n-36ΔT ≤ 60\n\nDivide both sides by -36, reverse inequality: ΔT ≥ 60 / (-36) = -60/36 = -5/3 ≈ -1.666, but since ΔT≥0, this is always true.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -25 -36ΔT => 0 +25 ≤ -36ΔT? 0 ≤ -25 -36ΔT => 25 ≤ -36ΔT? No:\n\n0 ≤ -25 -36ΔT => add 25: 25 ≤ -36ΔT\n\nThen, 25 ≤ -36ΔT, so -36ΔT ≥ 25, multiply both sides by -1, reverse: 36ΔT ≤ -25, then ΔT ≤ -25/36 ≈ -0.694, impossible since ΔT≥0.\n\nSo the second part is never true, thus 0 never in span for this car.\n\nSo freeway 4 is always safe at x=0.\n\nBut there's only one car? Freeway 4 has only one car listed.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as freeway 4? \"5 | (-60, -25, left, 36) |\" only one car, same as above, so always safe.\n\nFreeway 6: (42, 31, right, 6)  // head=42, tail=31, direction right\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [31 + 6 ΔT, 42 + 6 ΔT]\n\n0 in? 31 +6ΔT ≤0 ≤42+6ΔT\n\n31+6ΔT ≤0: 6ΔT ≤ -31, ΔT ≤ -31/6 ≈ -5.166, impossible\n\n0≤42+6ΔT always, but left false, so never. Min 31+6ΔT ≥31>0, so always safe.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-4, -15, right, 4) and (60, 49, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: head=-4, tail=-15, right\n\nSpan at T: [-15 + 4 ΔT, -4 + 4 ΔT]\n\n0 in if -15 +4ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -4 +4ΔT\n\nWhich is -15 +4ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -4 +4ΔT\n\nFirst: -15 +4ΔT ≤ 0 => 4ΔT ≤ 15 => ΔT ≤ 15/4 = 3.75\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -4 +4ΔT => 4ΔT ≥ 4 => ΔT ≥ 1\n\nSo for ΔT from 1 to 3.75, so ΔT=1,2,3\n\nAt ΔT=1: [-15+4, -4+4] = [-11, 0], 0 in\n\nΔT=2: [-15+8, -4+8] = [-7,4], 0 in since -7≤0≤4\n\nΔT=3: [-15+12, -4+12] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nΔT=4: [-15+16, -4+16] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,4) span [49+4ΔT, 60+4ΔT], min 49+4ΔT ≥49>0, never covers 0.\n\nSo for freeway 7, occupied at x=0 for ΔT=1,2,3 i.e. T=95,96,97.\n\nFreeway 8: (-3, -14, right, 3)  // head=-3, tail=-14, direction right\n\nSpan at T: [-14 + 3 ΔT, -3 + 3 ΔT]\n\n0 in if -14 +3ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -3 +3ΔT\n\nWhich is -14 +3ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -3 +3ΔT\n\nFirst: -14 +3ΔT ≤ 0 => 3ΔT ≤ 14 => ΔT ≤ 14/3 ≈ 4.666\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -3 +3ΔT => 3ΔT ≥ 3 => ΔT ≥ 1\n\nSo for ΔT from 1 to 4.666, so ΔT=1,2,3,4\n\nAt ΔT=1: [-14+3, -3+3] = [-11, 0], 0 in\n\nΔT=2: [-14+6, -3+6] = [-8,3], 0 in\n\nΔT=3: [-14+9, -3+9] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔT=4: [-14+12, -3+12] = [-2,9], 0 in\n\nΔT=5: [-14+15, -3+15] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo occupied at T=95,96,97,98\n\nNow, summarize for each row, the turns when x=0 is occupied (collision if on that row at that turn):\n\n- y=1: never occupied (always safe)\n\n- y=2: occupied at T=95\n\n- y=3: occupied at T=95 (since same as y=2)\n\n- y=4: always safe (freeway 4 and 5 safe, y=4 is freeway 4? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, which is always safe.\n\nSimilarly y=5 freeway 5, always safe.\n\ny=6 freeway 6, always safe.\n\ny=7: occupied at T=95,96,97\n\ny=8: occupied at T=95,96,97,98\n\nPlayer starts at turn 94, y=4.\n\nAt turn 94, on y=4, which is safe since always safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, no cars, since cars only on y=1 to 8, so y=9 is always safe.\n\nBut to be on y=9, I need to arrive there at some turn.\n\nNow, minimal H: since start y=4, end y=9, difference 5, so min H=5 if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I need to check if I can go up from turn 94 to turn 98, for example.\n\nLet’s plan the path.\n\nTurn 94: at y=4, safe.\n\nAction: I can choose U, D, or S.\n\nSince I want to go up, probably U or S, but S might be needed to wait.\n\nBut min H, so I should go U if possible.\n\nAfter action, at turn 95, I will be at new position based on action at turn 94.\n\nAt turn 94, I take action, which determines y at turn 95.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on action at turn t.\n\nSo at turn t, I take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + a_t effect.\n\nFor turn 94, action a_{94}, then y_{95} = y_{94} + Δy_{94}\n\ny_{94} =4.\n\nIf a_{94} = U, y_{95} =5\n\nIf D, y_{95}=3\n\nIf S, y_{95}=4\n\nThen at turn 95, I am on y_{95}, and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn based on where I am.\n\nFor turn 94: I am at y=4, and since y=4 is always safe, no collision regardless of action? Collision depends on position at that turn.\n\nAt turn 94, I am on y=4, which is safe, so no collision. Then I take action.\n\nNow, I want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nPossible to go up directly: actions U,U,U,U,U to go from 4 to 9 in 5 turns.\n\nBut need to check safety at each step.\n\nStart turn 94, y=4, safe.\n\nAction a_{94}: if I take U, then y_{95} =5\n\nAt turn 95, I am at y=5.\n\ny=5 is freeway 5, always safe, so safe.\n\nThen action a_{95}: take U, y_{96}=6\n\nTurn 96, at y=6, freeway 6, always safe, safe.\n\nAction a_{96}: U, y_{97}=7\n\nTurn 97, at y=7.\n\ny=7 is freeway 7, which is occupied at T=95,96,97? T=95,96,97 are unsafe for y=7.\n\nTurn 97, which is T=97, ΔT=97-94=3, which is in {95,96,97} for y=7, so occupied, collision if on y=7 at turn 97.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=7 at turn 97, collision.\n\nIf I take S at some point or something.\n\nIn this path, at turn 97, y=7, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up earlier.\n\nAnother path: suppose at turn 94, I take S, stay at y=4.\n\nThen turn 95, still y=4, safe.\n\nBut y=4 safe, but I need to move up.\n\nAt turn 95, if I take U, y_{96}=5\n\nThen turn 96 at y=5, safe.\n\nThen U, y_{97}=6, turn 97 at y=6, safe.\n\nThen U, y_{98}=7, turn 98 at y=7.\n\nNow turn 98, T=98, ΔT=4, for y=7, occupied at T=95,96,97, but not at T=98? Earlier: y=7 occupied at T=95,96,97, ΔT=1,2,3.\n\nT=98, ΔT=4, not occupied, since at ΔT=4, first car span [-15+16, -4+16]=[1,12], no 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen action at turn 98, U to y_{99}=8\n\nTurn 99 at y=8.\n\ny=8 is freeway 8, occupied at T=95,96,97,98.\n\nT=99, ΔT=5, span [-14+15, -3+15]=[1,12], 0 not in, so safe? Earlier for y=8, occupied at ΔT=1,2,3,4, T=95 to 98.\n\nT=99, ΔT=5, not occupied, safe.\n\nThen action U to y_{100}=9, reached.\n\nBut this took 6 turns: from turn 94 to 99, positions: turn94 y4, turn95 y4, turn96 y5, turn97 y6, turn98 y7, turn99 y8, then turn100 y9? Let's count turns.\n\nTurn 94: start, y=4\n\nAfter action a94, y95 set.\n\nSequence of actions from t=94 to t=94+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t1 + H, position is set.\n\nt1=94.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, y_{t1+H} should be 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{t1+H} = y_{t1} + sum of actions.\n\ny_{t1} =4, y_{t1+H} =9, so sum of Δy = +5, so at least 5 U actions, and H at least 5.\n\nIn the path above with waiting: at turn94, action S, so y95=4\n\nThen turn95, action U, y96=5\n\nTurn96, action U, y97=6\n\nTurn97, action U, y98=7\n\nTurn98, action U, y99=8\n\nTurn99, action U, y100=9\n\nSo at turn100, y=9, reached. H=6 actions? Actions from t=94 to t=99, that's 6 actions: t94,95,96,97,98,99.\n\nH is the number of turns for actions, from t=94 to t=94+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, turn t1 + H.\n\nHere, after 6 actions, turn 100.\n\nBut min possible is 5.\n\nCan I do it in 5 actions?\n\nActions from t=94 to t=98 (5 actions), then at turn 99, y_{99} should be 9.\n\ny_{99} = y_{94} + sum_{t=94}^{98} Δy_t\n\ny_{94}=4, y_{99}=9, so sum Δy = +5, so all U actions.\n\nSo actions: U at t94, U at t95, U at t96, U at t97, U at t98.\n\nThen positions:\n\nTurn 94: y=4, safe (as before)\n\nAfter U, y95=5\n\nTurn 95: at y=5, safe\n\nAfter U, y96=6\n\nTurn 96: at y=6, safe\n\nAfter U, y97=7\n\nTurn 97: at y=7, but y=7 occupied at T=97 (ΔT=3), so collision!\n\nNot safe.\n\nIf I go faster, but I can only move one step per turn, so I have to be at intermediate rows.\n\nPerhaps I can go down or something, but that might take more turns.\n\nAnother idea: go to a row that is safe earlier.\n\nFor example, y=1 is always safe, but y=1 is below, I need to go up.\n\nCurrently at y=4, I can go up or down.\n\nBut down might not help.\n\nSince y=7 is unsafe from T=95 to 97, and y=8 from 95 to 98.\n\nBut at T=99, both y=7 and y=8 are safe.\n\nIn the min path with 5 actions, I need to be at y=7 at some turn.\n\nThe unsafe turns for y=7 are 95,96,97.\n\nSimilarly for y=8: 95,96,97,98.\n\nTo avoid collision, I cannot be on y=7 at T=95,96,97 or on y=8 at T=95,96,97,98.\n\nIn the direct path, I am on y=7 at T=97 which is unsafe.\n\nI could delay being on y=7 until T=98 or later.\n\nBut with min actions, I need to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nStart: T=94, y=4, safe.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at T=99 for H=5.\n\ny_{99} =9.\n\nThe path: from y=4 at T=94 to y=9 at T=99.\n\nI must be at y=5,6,7,8 at some turns.\n\nSpecifically, since I move one step per turn, the position at each turn must be integer y.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nFor T from 94 to 99.\n\nAt T=94: y=4\n\nT=95: y=5 or 4 or 3, depending on action at T=94\n\nSimilarly, T=96: etc., up to T=99: y=9\n\nCollision depends on y_T and T.\n\ny_T must be between 0 and 9.\n\nNow, constraints:\n\n- At T=95: y=2 and y=3 are occupied? Only if on that row.\n\ny=2 occupied at T=95, so if at T=95, I am on y=2, collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at T=95, collision.\n\ny=7 at T=95,96,97 collision.\n\ny=8 at T=95,96,97,98 collision.\n\nOther rows are safe at those times.\n\nNow, for min H=5, I need y_{99}=9, with y_{94}=4.\n\nThe sequence of y_T: T=94:4, T=95:?, T=96:?, T=97:?, T=98:?, T=99:9\n\ny_{99} = y_{98} + Δy_{98}, so y_{98} must be 8 or 9, but since y_{99}=9, if y_{98}=9, then Δy_{98}=S or D, but D would go down, not good, so for min up, y_{98} should be 8, then U to 9.\n\nSimilarly, y_{97} should be 7 or 8, but to go up, probably 7 then U to 8, etc.\n\nBut let's list possible y_T.\n\nAt T=95: y can be 3,4,5 (since from y=4, action D,S,U)\n\nBut y=3 at T=95: y=3 is occupied at T=95, unsafe.\n\ny=4 at T=95: safe\n\ny=5 at T=95: safe\n\nSo at T=95, I can be at y=4 or y=5, not y=3.\n\nSimilarly, T=96: y can be from previous.\n\nBut let's think the path to y=9 at T=99.\n\ny_{99}=9, so y_{98} must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_{98}=9, then to have y_{98}=9, it must come from y_{97}=9 or 8 or 10, but y=10 invalid, so y_{97}=9 and S, or y_{97}=8 and U, or y_{97}=9 and D, but D not good.\n\nSimilarly, y_{98}=8 could come from y_{97}=7,8,9 with actions.\n\nBut to minimize, better to have increasing.\n\nAssume we go up as much as possible.\n\nSo y_{98} should be 8, then U to 9 at T=99.\n\ny_{98}=8 must be set at T=98.\n\ny_{98} comes from y_{97} with action at T=97.\n\nIf y_{97}=7, action U to y_{98}=8\n\nIf y_{97}=8, action S to y_{98}=8\n\nIf y_{97}=9, action D to y_{98}=8, but not efficient.\n\nSimilarly, y_{97} must be 7 or 8.\n\nNow, at T=97, if y_{97}=7, but y=7 is occupied at T=97, unsafe.\n\nIf y_{97}=8, y=8 occupied at T=97? T=97, ΔT=3, for y=8, occupied at T=95,96,97,98? T=97 is unsafe for y=8.\n\ny=8 occupied at T=95,96,97,98.\n\nT=97 is one of them.\n\nSo at T=97, if I am on y=7 or y=8, both unsafe.\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=97, y=8 unsafe at T=97.\n\nBut I need to be at some y at T=97.\n\nWhat about other y? y=6 is safe at all times, y=5 safe, etc.\n\nBut if at T=97, I am on y=6, for example, then to reach y_{98}=8, I need to go up twice, but I can only move one per turn.\n\nFrom T=97 to T=98, I move one step, so if at T=97 y=6, then at T=98 I can be y=5,6,7.\n\nBut I need y_{98}=8 for efficiency.\n\nIf at T=97 y=6, action U, then y_{98}=7.\n\nThen at T=98, on y=7.\n\ny=7 at T=98: ΔT=4, which is not in 95,96,97, so safe.\n\nThen action U to y_{99}=8, but I need y_{99}=9, so at T=99 y=8, then I need another action to go to 9, but that would be turn 100, H=6.\n\nBut for H=5, I need y_{99}=9 directly.\n\nBack to T=97.\n\nAt T=97, I cannot be on y=7 or y=8 because both unsafe.\n\nI could be on y=6, y=5, y=4, y=9? Not yet.\n\ny=6 is safe, y=5 safe, etc.\n\nBut if at T=97, y=6, then to have y_{99}=9, I need to go up three steps in two turns, impossible since max +1 per turn.\n\nFrom T=97 to T=99, two actions, can increase by at most 2, so if y_{97}=6, y_{99} <=8.\n\nSimilarly, if y_{97}=7, y_{99}<=9, but y=7 unsafe at T=97.\n\ny_{97}=8, y_{99}<=10 invalid or 9 with S or D.\n\nBut y=8 unsafe at T=97.\n\nSo the only possibilities for y_{97} to reach y_{99}=9 are:\n\n- If y_{97}=7, then actions: U at T97 to y98=8, then U at T98 to y99=9\n\nBut at T=97, if on y=7, unsafe.\n\n- If y_{97}=8, then action S at T97 to y98=8, then U at T98 to y99=9? y98=8, then action at T98 U to y99=9.\n\nBut at T=97, on y=8, unsafe.\n\n- If y_{97}=9, then action D or S, but to y99=9, if S, y98=9, y99=9, but y97=9, how to reach y97=9? Earlier.\n\ny97=9 not possible from start in few turns.\n\nSimilarly, y97=6, then y98=7 or 6 or 5, then y99=8,9 or less, but cannot reach 9 in one step from 7 or8, but from y98=7, U to 8, not 9.\n\ny99 = y98 + action, so to have y99=9, y98 must be 8 or9.\n\nIf y98=8, U to 9\n\nIf y98=9, S to 9\n\nNow y98 must be set at T=98.\n\ny98 depends on y97 and action at T97.\n\nIf y97=7, U to y98=8\n\nBut at T97, y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf y97=8, S to y98=8, but at T97, y=8 unsafe.\n\nIf y97=9, D to y98=8 or S to9, etc.\n\nBut y97=9 not possible.\n\nOther y97: if y97=6, action U to y98=7\n\nThen y98=7, at T=98.\n\nThen to have y99=9, need action U to y99=8, but y99=8, not 9. Cannot reach 9.\n\nIf y97=5, even worse.\n\nSo indeed, for H=5, to have y99=9, we must have y98=8 and action U at T98, or y98=9 and S, but y98=9 requires earlier position.\n\nBut y98=8 must come from y97=7 with U or y97=8 with S.\n\nBut both cases require being on y=7 or y=8 at T=97, which are both unsafe.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 by turn 99 with no collision; that is, H=5 is impossible.\n\nThus minimal H must be at least 6.\n\nWith H=6, we can reach by turn 100.\n\nAs I thought earlier: start turn 94 y=4\n\nAction at T94: S, so y95=4 (since S, Δy=0)\n\nAt T95, on y=4, safe.\n\nAction at T95: U, so y96=5\n\nAt T96, on y=5, safe.\n\nAction at T96: U, so y97=6\n\nAt T97, on y=6, safe.\n\nAction at T97: U, so y98=7\n\nAt T98, on y=7, T=98, ΔT=4, y=7 safe as not occupied.\n\nAction at T98: U, so y99=8\n\nAt T99, on y=8, T=99, ΔT=5, y=8 safe.\n\nAction at T99: U, so y100=9, reached.\n\nAnd actions: T94: S, T95: U, T96: U, T97: U, T98: U, T99: U\n\nBut H=6 actions, from T94 to T99.\n\nIn the sequence, at T94 action S, then T95 action U, etc.\n\nBut is there a faster way? H=6 is minimal since H=5 impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can go up earlier to avoid waiting, but I have to wait somewhere because of the unsafe times.\n\nAnother path: suppose at T94, I go U to y95=5\n\nAt T95, on y=5, safe.\n\nBut at T95, if I go U to y96=6, then T96 on y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T96, if I go U to y97=7, but T97 on y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf at T96 I go S, stay at y=6, then T97 on y=6, safe.\n\nThen action at T97 U to y98=7, T98 on y=7 safe (T=98), then U to y99=8, T99 on y=8, then U to y100=9, same as before, but I used S at T96, so actions: T94 U, T95 U, T96 S, T97 U, T98 U, T99 U, still 6 actions, and reached at T100.\n\nCompared to previous, I moved up earlier but waited at y=6 instead of y=4.\n\nBut same number of turns.\n\nI could go to y=1 or something, but that might take more down actions, increasing H.\n\nFor example, go down to y=1 at some point, but then need to come up, more actions.\n\nSo H=6 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the first path, I stayed at y=4 for one turn.\n\nIn the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut let me confirm the actions.\n\nt1 = 94.\n\nSequence of actions: for t from 94 to 94+H-1.\n\nH=6, so t=94 to 99.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 94: S (stay)\n\nThen y95=4\n\nTurn 95: U (up)\n\ny96=5\n\nTurn 96: U\n\ny97=6\n\nTurn 97: U\n\ny98=7\n\nTurn 98: U\n\ny99=8\n\nTurn 99: U\n\ny100=9\n\nAt each turn, position safe as above.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 95, I am on y=4, which is safe, no car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nPerhaps I can start by going up.\n\nTurn 94: U, then y95=5\n\nAt turn 95, on y=5, safe.\n\nThen turn 95: S or U.\n\nIf turn 95: U, then y96=6, turn 96 on y=6 safe.\n\nThen turn 96: if U, y97=7, but turn 97 on y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo I must not go to y=7 at turn 97.\n\nSo at turn 96, I can take S or D.\n\nIf S, stay at y=6, turn 97 on y=6 safe.\n\nThen turn 97: U to y98=7, turn 98 on y=7 safe.\n\nThen turn 98: U to y99=8, turn 99 on y=8, but y=8 at turn 99 safe? T=99, ΔT=5, not occupied.\n\nThen turn 99: U to y100=9.\n\nBut I reached at turn 100, same as before.\n\nActions: T94: U, T95: U, T96: S, T97: U, T98: U, T99: U\n\nStill 6 actions.\n\nCompared to first sequence: T94: S, T95: U, T96: U, T97: U, T98: U, T99: U\n\nIn both cases, H=6.\n\nThe first one has one S at beginning, second has S at T96.\n\nBut both fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output minimal H and sequence.\n\nH=6.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=6 but different actions?\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier by going down, but no, going down would require more up later.\n\nFor example, go to y=3, but at T=95, y=3 is occupied, so I cannot be on y=3 at T=95.\n\nAt T=94, if I go D to y95=3, but at T=95, y=3 occupied, collision.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nThus, minimal H=6.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I can choose either.\n\nBut in the first sequence, I stayed at start, which might be simpler.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence of actions.\n\nt1=94.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 94: S\n\nTurn 95: U\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nAfter these, at turn 100, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 99 action U to go to y=9 at turn 100.\n\nThe sequence has 6 actions, from t=94 to 99.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write the turns.\n\nAlso, for freeway, y=4 is freeway 4, which I said always safe, but let me confirm at turn 94.\n\nAt turn 94, ΔT=0, freeway 4: car span [-60, -25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly other turns, since left-moving and decreasing, but as computed, never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\ny=7 at turn 98: ΔT=4, span for first car [-15+16, -4+16]=[1,12], no 0; second car not cover.\n\ny=8 at turn 99: ΔT=5, [-14+15, -3+15]=[1,12], no 0.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo minimal H=6.\n\nSequence: S at t94, then U,U,U,U,U for t95 to t99.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=94 to t=99.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 94: S\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: U\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\nTurn 99: U\n}\n\nBut H=6, and turns from 94 to 99.\n\nThe player reaches (0,9) at turn 100.\n\nBut the sequence is up to turn 99.\n\nYes.\n\nTo make it clear.\n\nI think that's fine.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 94\\) is 6. This is determined by analyzing the car positions and their movements over time to avoid collisions, as collisions occur only if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) at turn \\(T\\) where a car spans \\(x=0\\) at that turn.\n\n### Key Constraints from Car Occupancy:\n- **Freeway 1**: Always safe (no car covers \\(x=0\\)).\n- **Freeway 2**: Occupied at \\(T = 95\\) (collision if on \\(y=2\\) at \\(T=95\\)).\n- **Freeway 3**: Occupied at \\(T = 95\\) (collision if on \\(y=3\\) at \\(T=95\\)).\n- **Freeway 4**: Always safe.\n- **Freeway 5**: Always safe.\n- **Freeway 6**: Always safe.\n- **Freeway 7**: Occupied at \\(T = 95, 96, 97\\) (collision if on \\(y=7\\) at these turns).\n- **Freeway 8**: Occupied at \\(T = 95, 96, 97, 98\\) (collision if on \\(y=8\\) at these turns).\n\nThe player must avoid being on the affected freeways at the specified turns. Starting at \\(y=4\\) (turn 94), the goal is to reach \\(y=9\\) in minimal turns while respecting collision constraints.\n\n### Why \\(H = 5\\) is Impossible:\n- To reach \\(y=9\\) by turn 99 (with \\(H=5\\) actions from turn 94 to 98), the player must be at \\(y=8\\) at turn 98 and move up to \\(y=9\\) at turn 99.\n- However, at turn 97, the player must be at \\(y=7\\) or \\(y=8\\) to reach \\(y=8\\) by turn 98:\n  - If at \\(y=7\\) at turn 97, collision occurs (freeway 7 occupied at \\(T=97\\)).\n  - If at \\(y=8\\) at turn 97, collision occurs (freeway 8 occupied at \\(T=97\\)).\n- Alternative positions at turn 97 (e.g., \\(y=6\\)) cannot reach \\(y=9\\) by turn 99 with only one action (maximum \\(\\Delta y = +1\\) per turn). Thus, \\(H=5\\) is infeasible.\n\n### Optimal Sequence for \\(H = 6\\):\n- **Turn 94**: Start at \\(y=4\\) (safe). Action \\(S\\) (stay) to remain at \\(y=4\\) for turn 95, avoiding movement to unsafe rows.\n- **Turn 95**: At \\(y=4\\) (safe, freeway 4 always safe). Action \\(U\\) (up) to move to \\(y=5\\).\n- **Turn 96**: At \\(y=5\\) (safe, freeway 5 always safe). Action \\(U\\) to move to \\(y=6\\).\n- **Turn 97**: At \\(y=6\\) (safe, freeway 6 always safe). Action \\(U\\) to move to \\(y=7\\).\n- **Turn 98**: At \\(y=7\\) (safe, as \\(T=98\\) is not occupied for freeway 7). Action \\(U\\) to move to \\(y=8\\).\n- **Turn 99**: At \\(y=8\\) (safe, as \\(T=99\\) is not occupied for freeway 8). Action \\(U\\) to reach \\(y=9\\).\n\nThis sequence takes 6 actions (turns 94 to 99), reaching \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 100 with no collisions. Any other sequence either causes a collision or requires more than 6 turns.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}\\) for \\(t\\) from \\(t_1 = 94\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 94 + 6 - 1 = 99\\) is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 94: S \\\\\nTurn 95: U \\\\\nTurn 96: U \\\\\nTurn 97: U \\\\\nTurn 98: U \\\\\nTurn 99: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 95, and the player is at (0,4). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8).\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) at each turn. The vertical position y is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) at that same turn.\n\nImportant: When the player moves from y to y' at turn T, at turn T they are still on y (so they only check the cars on y at turn T). Then at turn T+1, they are on y' (so they check cars on y' at turn T+1).\n\nThe goal is to get to y=9. Note that y=9 is the top and there are no cars (since cars are only on freeways 1 to 8). So once we are at y=9, we are safe.\n\nWe start at y=4 at turn 95.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) for turns 95, 96, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe must avoid collisions. That means for each turn T (starting at 95) and for the freeway we are on at that turn (if we are on freeway y, which is between 1 and 8) we must check that no car on that freeway at turn T has a span that includes 0.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn 95 (t1). For each car, we are given (head, tail, direction, speed). Note that for left-moving cars, the head is the rightmost point? Actually, the update rule clarifies:\n\n- Left-moving: at turn t1, the car span is [h, τ] and then at turn T, it becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n- Right-moving: at turn t1, the car span is [τ, h] (so head is h, which is the front) and then at turn T, it becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So the head is the larger number? Actually, for a right-moving car, the head is the front (which is the right end). So at t1, the car occupies from τ to h (with τ < h). Then at T, it moves to [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, the head is the front (which is the left end? but the update moves it to the left). Actually, the update rule for left-moving: [h, τ] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. So if the car is left-moving, the head h is the rightmost point? Because then when it moves left, the head becomes h - s*(T-t1) and the tail becomes τ - s*(T-t1). But the problem states the span as [h, τ] for left-moving. However, in the example for left-moving, if h is the head (front) and the car is moving left, then the front should be the leftmost? This is confusing.\n\nLet me clarify with the provided data:\n\nExample for freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36). But wait, 48 and 83: if it's left-moving, the span is [h, τ] = [48, 83]. But 48 < 83? Then the car would be from 48 to 83? But then if it moves left, the span becomes [48 - s*dt, 83 - s*dt]. However, the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then moves to [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt]. So if h=48 and τ=83, then the car is from 48 to 83? But then when moving left, the entire segment moves left. That makes sense. But note: the head is the front? For a left-moving car, the front (head) is the leftmost point? But in this representation, the head (h) is 48 and the tail (τ) is 83, so the head is the left end? Because when it moves left, the head becomes 48 - s*dt and the tail becomes 83 - s*dt. So the head is the leading part (the left end). Similarly, for right-moving, the head is the leading part (the right end).\n\nSo to summarize:\n\n- Left-moving car: head = left end, tail = right end? But wait: the update rule for left-moving: [h, τ] becomes [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt]. So if h is the left end and τ is the right end, then the car spans from h to τ (so h < τ). Then moving left, both decrease.\n\nBut in the example for freeway 4: (48,83) -> so h=48, τ=83? But then the car is from 48 to 83? That's a length of 36? Actually, the length of the car is |h - τ| + 1? But wait, the problem doesn't specify the length. However, we don't need the exact length because we only care if 0 is in the interval [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] for left-moving, or [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] for right-moving.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". So we only need to check if 0 is in the interval of the car at turn T.\n\nNow, let's note the freeways we have:\n\nWe are at y=4 at turn 95. We need to go to y=9. We can move up (increasing y) or down (decreasing y) or stay.\n\nWe must avoid y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 at the turns when we are on them, if there is a car that covers 0 at that turn.\n\nBut note: at turn 95, we are at y=4. So we have to check the cars on freeway 4 at turn 95? Actually, we are at (0,4) at turn 95, so we are on freeway 4 at turn 95. We must check if there is a car on freeway 4 that has 0 in its span at turn 95.\n\nLet's check freeway 4: \n  Car: (48, 83, left, 36) -> so at turn 95, the span is [48, 83]?\nBut wait: the problem says for left-moving: the span is [h, τ] = [48,83]. So the car is from 48 to 83. Does 0 fall in [48,83]? No, because 0 is less than 48. So at turn 95, we are safe at y=4.\n\nBut we are going to plan for the next turns.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway and for each future turn T (relative to t1=95) the position of the cars.\n\nLet dt = T - 95.\n\nFor each car, we can compute the span at time T.\n\nWe are going to simulate the player's movement and check for each step which freeway we are on and if at that turn, the car spans on that freeway cover 0.\n\nWe want the minimal H (number of turns) to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H without any obstacles would be 5 (since from 4 to 9: 5 steps up). But we have to avoid collisions.\n\nSo let's compute the car positions for future turns.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars and their update:\n\nFreeway 1: \n  One car: (-48, -95, right, 48) \n  Direction: right -> so at time T, span = [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt] = [-95 + 48*dt, -48 + 48*dt]\n\nFreeway 2: \n  Two cars:\n    Car1: (0, -11, right, 12) -> right-moving: [ -11 + 12*dt, 0 + 12*dt ]\n    Car2: (-48, -59, right, 12) -> [ -59 + 12*dt, -48 + 12*dt ]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? \n    Car1: (0, -11, right, 12) -> [ -11 + 12*dt, 0 + 12*dt ]\n    Car2: (-48, -59, right, 12) -> [ -59 + 12*dt, -48 + 12*dt ]\n\nFreeway 4: \n  One car: (48, 83, left, 36) -> left-moving: [48 - 36*dt, 83 - 36*dt]\n\nFreeway 5: \n  One car: (48, 83, left, 36) -> same as freeway 4: [48 - 36*dt, 83 - 36*dt]\n\nFreeway 6: \n  One car: (48, 37, right, 6) -> wait, the format is (head, tail, direction, speed). \n  For right-moving, the span is [τ, h] = [37, 48]? But the problem says: for right-moving, the initial span is [τ, h]. So if the car is given as (48,37,right,6), does that mean h=48 and τ=37? Then the span at t1 is [37,48]? Then at T: [37 + 6*dt, 48 + 6*dt]\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" so [37,48] at t1=95.\n\nFreeway 7: \n  Two cars:\n    Car1: (0, -11, right, 4) -> [ -11 + 4*dt, 0 + 4*dt ]\n    Car2: (-48, -59, right, 4) -> [ -59 + 4*dt, -48 + 4*dt ]\n\nFreeway 8: \n  One car: (0, -11, right, 3) -> [ -11 + 3*dt, 0 + 3*dt ]\n\nNow, we are at turn 95 (dt=0) at y=4.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal steps are 5 (all U). Let's check if we can do that without colliding.\n\nWe will be at:\n  Turn 95: y=4 -> check freeway 4 at dt=0: [48,83] -> 0 not in [48,83] -> safe.\n  Turn 96: we move to y=5 (if we choose U). Then at turn 96, we are on y=5 -> check freeway 5 at dt=1: [48-36*1, 83-36*1] = [12,47] -> 0 not in [12,47] -> safe.\n  Turn 97: y=6 -> check freeway 6 at dt=2: [37+6*2, 48+6*2] = [37+12,48+12] = [49,60] -> 0 not in [49,60] -> safe.\n  Turn 98: y=7 -> check freeway 7 at dt=3: \n        Car1: [-11+4*3, 0+4*3] = [-11+12, 12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12]? \n        Car2: [-59+4*3, -48+4*3] = [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47, -36] -> 0 not in.\n        So safe.\n  Turn 99: y=8 -> check freeway 8 at dt=4: [ -11+3*4, 0+3*4] = [-11+12, 12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  Turn 100: y=9 -> we are done (no freeway at 9).\n\nSo if we do U, U, U, U, U (5 steps) we are done. But wait, at turn 95 we start and we take actions at turns 95,96,97,98,99. Then at turn 99 we are at y=9? \n\nBut note: we start at turn 95 at y=4. Then:\n  Turn95: action U -> at turn96, we are at y=5.\n  Turn96: action U -> at turn97, we are at y=6.\n  Turn97: action U -> at turn98, we are at y=7.\n  Turn98: action U -> at turn99, we are at y=8.\n  Turn99: action U -> at turn100, we are at y=9.\n\nSo we need 5 actions: turns 95 to 99 (H=5).\n\nBut we have to check for collisions at each turn when we are on a freeway (1-8). We are on freeway at:\n  Turn95: y=4 -> freeway4 -> safe (as above)\n  Turn96: y=5 -> freeway5 -> [48-36*1, 83-36*1] = [12,47] -> safe\n  Turn97: y=6 -> freeway6 -> [37+6*2,48+6*2] = [49,60] -> safe\n  Turn98: y=7 -> freeway7 -> at dt=3 (since from turn95, dt=3? Actually, at turn98, T=98, so dt=98-95=3)\n        Car1: [-11+4*3, 0+4*3] = [1,12] -> does not contain 0? 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n        Car2: [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36] -> safe.\n  Turn99: y=8 -> freeway8 -> at dt=4: [ -11+3*4, 0+3*4] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn100, we are at y=9 and we don't check because we are done at the end of the last action? Actually, we are done when we are at y=9 at the start of a turn? Or after the last action? \n\nThe problem says: we are to have y_{t1+H-1}=9. So after H-1 steps from the first action (which is at t1), we are at y=9.\n\nOur actions: \n  t1=95: action0 (U) -> at time96: y=5\n  t1+1=96: action1 (U) -> at time97: y=6\n  t1+2=97: action2 (U) -> at time98: y=7\n  t1+3=98: action3 (U) -> at time99: y=8\n  t1+4=99: action4 (U) -> at time100: y=9\n\nSo H-1 = 4? Actually, we have 5 actions: t=95,96,97,98,99. Then H=5? And at time t1+H-1 = 95+4 = 99, we are at y=9? But at the end of the last action (at time99) we are at y=9 at time100? \n\nWait, the state update: \n  At turn t, we are at y_t. We take action a_t, and then we get y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at the start of turn95: we are at (0,4). Then we take an action at turn95, and then at the start of turn96, we are at the new y.\n\nTherefore, we are done when at the start of a turn we are at y=9? But the problem says: we need to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nActually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that after H actions, we have y_{t1+H} = 9? But note: the index: \n  t=0: a_{t1+0} = a_{95} -> then at time96: y= y_{96} = y95 + Δy95\n  ...\n  t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1} -> then at time t1+H: y_{t1+H} = y_{95+H}\n\nWe want y_{95+H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\" ? That would be at the turn after the last action? \n\nLet me read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nSo the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then the position becomes y_{t1+H-1}? \n\nWait, no: the action at turn t is applied to update y_{t} to y_{t+1}. So:\n\n  At turn t1 (95), we are at y_{t1}=4. Then we take action a_{t1} -> then we are at y_{t1+1} (96) = 4 + Δy.\n\nWe take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then the next state is at turn t1+H: y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy_{t1+H-1}.\n\nBut the problem says we require y_{t1+H-1}=9? That would be at the turn we start? Then we don't even need to take an action? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking at the update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t is determined by action at turn t.\n\nSo if we take an action at turn t, then at turn t+1 we have the new y.\n\nThe sequence of actions: \n  a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1} -> total H actions.\n\nThe positions we are at during these actions:\n  At the beginning of turn t1: we are at y_{t1} (given).\n  After action a_{t1} (at the beginning of turn t1+1): y_{t1+1}.\n  ...\n  After action a_{t1+H-1} (at the beginning of turn t1+H): y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe require that at the beginning of turn t1+H, we are at y=9? But the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nWait, the problem says: \"minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nBut note: the index of the position: \n  We start at t1: y_{t1}=4.\n  After the first action (at t1): we get y_{t1+1}.\n  After the last action (at t1+H-1): we get y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut we require y_{t1+H-1}=9? That would be the position at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Then we haven't taken the last action? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we are to have y=9 at the turn when we take the last action? But that would be at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9? Then we don't need to move? \n\nBut the problem says: we start at (0,4) at turn t1=95. We need to get to (0,9). So we must move.\n\nLet me check the problem statement: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nAnd the sequence of actions is from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1.\n\nSo the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1. And at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}? Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} and then we are at y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut the problem requires y_{t1+H-1}=9? That would mean we are already at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1? Then we don't need to take an action? \n\nBut if we are at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, then we can just not take an action? But we are required to output an action for that turn? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a typo? \n\nLooking at the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nBut note: when we take the action a_{t1+t} at time t1+t, then the position becomes y_{t1+t+1} = y_{t1+t} + Δy_{t1+t}.\n\nSo the position after the sequence of actions (which ends at a_{t1+H-1}) is y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the problem requires y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nThat would mean that at the beginning of the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are already at 9? Then we don't need to take the last action? \n\nBut the sequence has H actions. So if we are at 9 at the beginning of the last action, then we can take S (stay) and then we are still at 9 at the next turn? \n\nBut the requirement is y_{t1+H-1}=9, which is the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action at that turn and then we are at y_{t1+H} which must be 9? \n\nSo if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, we can take S and then y_{t1+H}=9. But we are required to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n\nThis is inconsistent because we start at 4.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we are to be at 9 at the turn when the last action is taken? But that would be the state after the action? \n\nI think there might be a confusion in the indexing.\n\nLet me re-read: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd the update: at turn t, we are at y_t, then we take a_t and then we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at turn t1: y_{t1}=4.\n\nWe take actions at t1, t1+1, ... until we get to y=9.\n\nWe are done when we have y_{?}=9.\n\nThe problem says: we require y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo if we set H=1, then we require y_{t1+0}=y_{95}=4=9? -> no.\n\nH=2: then we require y_{95+1}=y_{96}=9.\n\nSo we need to get to y=9 at the beginning of turn 96? That means we take one action at turn95 and then at turn96 we are at y=9.\n\nSimilarly, if H=5, then we require y_{95+4}=y_{99}=9.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn99, we are at y=9? Then we take an action at turn99 (the last action in the sequence) and then we are at y_{100}. But the requirement is only that at the beginning of turn99 we are at 9? Then we don't care about y_{100}? \n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the goal is to be at (0,9). We are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn99? Then we have reached.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways\" only when we are on freeways (1-8). At turn99, we are at y=9 -> not a freeway, so no collision check. And we don't need to do anything beyond that.\n\nBut then why do we have an action at turn99? Because the sequence of actions is for t=t1 to t1+H-1. So for H=5, we have actions at 95,96,97,98,99. And we require that at the beginning of turn99 (which is the time we take the last action) we are at y=9? \n\nBut when we take an action at turn99, we are at y=9 at the beginning, and then we take an action (say S) and then we are still at y=9 at turn100. But the requirement is only that at the beginning of turn99 we are at 9. So we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn99? Then we don't need to take an action? But we are forced to output an action for turn99.\n\nAlternatively, we might have reached y=9 at the beginning of turn99 by the action at turn98? \n\nSo the actions:\n  Turn95: a95 -> at turn96: y96\n  Turn96: a96 -> at turn97: y97\n  Turn97: a97 -> at turn98: y98\n  Turn98: a98 -> at turn99: y99\n\nWe require y99=9.\n\nSo we need to get to y=9 at the beginning of turn99.\n\nWe start at turn95: y95=4.\n\nSo we have 4 actions (from 95 to 98) to go from 4 to 9? That is 5 steps? But we have 4 actions -> 4 steps? \n\nBut 4 steps: \n  Step1: 4->5\n  Step2: 5->6\n  Step3: 6->7\n  Step4: 7->8 -> not 9.\n\nSo we need 5 actions? Then H=5: actions at 95,96,97,98,99 -> and we require y_{95+4}=y_{99}=9? \n\nBut then we need to get to 9 at the beginning of turn99. How? \n  After action95: at turn96: y96=5\n  After action96: at turn97: y97=6\n  After action97: at turn98: y98=7\n  After action98: at turn99: y99=8\n  Then action99: U -> at turn100: y100=9\n\nBut the requirement is y_{99}=9? But we are at 8 at the beginning of turn99. \n\nSo to have y99=9, we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn99. That means we must have reached 9 by the action at turn98.\n\nTherefore, we need to get to 9 at the beginning of turn99, which means the last action that moves us is at turn98.\n\nSo the sequence of actions is from turn95 to turn98 (if we do 4 actions) and then we are at y99=9. Then we don't need an action at turn99? But the sequence length is H, and we have actions from t1 to t1+H-1. So if H=4, then actions at 95,96,97,98. Then at the beginning of turn99, we are at y99=9.\n\nBut then we don't have an action for turn99? The sequence ends at turn98.\n\nSo the requirement: y_{t1+H-1}=y_{95+3}=y_{98}=? We require y_{99}=9? \n\nWait: the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nFor H=4: t1+H-1=95+3=98. So we require y98=9? \n\nBut we start at y95=4. Then we take 3 actions: 95,96,97 -> and then at turn98 we are at y98. \n\nTo get to 9 from 4 in 3 steps: we must move +5? But we can only move at most +1 per step. So we can't.\n\nTherefore, we need at least 5 steps? \n\nBut then H=5: we require y_{95+4}=y99=9. \n\nSo we need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn99.\n\nHow? \n  Start: y95=4.\n  Action95: U -> y96=5\n  Action96: U -> y97=6\n  Action97: U -> y98=7\n  Action98: U -> y99=8\n  Action99: U -> y100=9\n\nBut we require y99=9? We are at y99=8. \n\nSo we are missing one.\n\nWe must be at y99=9. That means we need to get to 9 at the beginning of turn99. \n\nBut we can only move one per step. So we need 5 steps: \n  Start at 4 (turn95).\n  After 1st action (U at 95): at turn96: 5\n  After 2nd action (U at 96): at turn97: 6\n  After 3rd action (U at 97): at turn98: 7\n  After 4th action (U at 98): at turn99: 8\n  After 5th action (U at 99): at turn100: 9\n\nBut the problem requires that at the beginning of turn99 (before the action) we are at 9? That is impossible in 5 steps because we start at 4 and need 5 moves.\n\nUnless we can move faster? But the moves are only ±1 or 0.\n\nSo I think there is a misunderstanding in the indexing.\n\nLet me check the problem: \"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nand \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nBut note: in the update, the state at time t is y_t. The action a_t is taken at time t and leads to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo the sequence of actions: \n  a_{t1} -> leads to y_{t1+1}\n  a_{t1+1} -> leads to y_{t1+2}\n  ...\n  a_{t1+H-1} -> leads to y_{t1+H}\n\nWe require y_{t1+H-1}=9? That would be the state at time t1+H-1, which is before the last action? \n\nFor example, if H=1: then we require y_{t1+0}=y_{95}=4=9? -> no.\n\nH=2: then we require y_{95+1}=y96=9.\n\nSo we need to get to 9 at the beginning of turn96? Then we take an action at turn95 that gets us from 4 to 9 in one move? But we can only move by ±1 or 0. Impossible.\n\nH=6: then we require y_{95+5}=y100=9.\n\nSo we need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn100. \n\nHow many actions? 5 actions: at 95,96,97,98,99.\n\nBecause the actions are from t1 to t1+H-1 = 95 to 95+5 = 100? But that would be 6 actions? \n\nH= the minimal number of turns for the actions? But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". And then the sequence has H actions.\n\nWe want to be at y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nFor H=6: we require y_{95+5}=y100=9.\n\nAnd we have actions at turns: 95,96,97,98,99,100? But that would be 6 actions.\n\nBut note: the sequence is from t=0 to H-1: so a_{t1+0} to a_{t1+H-1}. \n\nFor H=6: actions at 95,96,97,98,99,100. Then after the action at 100, we are at y101. But we require y_{100}=9? That means at the beginning of turn100, we are at 9? Then we take an action at turn100 and then we are at y101. But we don't care about y101? \n\nBut the requirement is only that at the beginning of turn100 we are at 9. Then we can take any action (S) and then we are still at 9 at turn101. But the sequence includes that action at turn100.\n\nAlternatively, we could do without that last action? But the problem requires a sequence of H actions.\n\nBut to be at 9 at the beginning of turn100, we must have been moved there by the action at turn99. So we need to have moved from 4 to 9 in 5 actions (95 to 99) and then at turn100 we are at 9. Then the action at turn100 is not necessary? But the problem requires the sequence to have H actions and that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nFor H=6: t1+H-1=95+5=100. So at the beginning of turn100, we must be at 9. But how did we get there? By the action at turn99. So the action at turn99 must have moved us to 9. Then we don't need an action at turn100? But the sequence has 6 actions, including one at turn100.\n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that after the last action, we are at 9? That is, at the beginning of turn t1+H, we are at 9.\n\nBecause after the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we have y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nThen we require y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nLet me look for the answer format: it only outputs actions from turn95 to some turn.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's assume that we require to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H. Then the last action we take is at turn t1+H-1, and that action gets us to 9.\n\nThen the number of actions is H.\n\nWe start at 4, so we need 5 actions (each U) to get to 9. Then H=5, and we are at y_{95+5}=y100=9.\n\nBut the problem says we require y_{t1+H-1}=9, which would be y99=9. But then we are at 9 at turn99, and then we take an action at turn99 (the last action) and then we are at y100 which might be 10 or 8 or 9? \n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", so it doesn't care about y100.\n\nSo if we can get to 9 at turn99, then we can output 5 actions: at 95,96,97,98,99, but then at turn99 (before the action) we are at 9? That means we must have been at 9 at the start of turn99, and then we take an action (S) and then we are still at 9 at turn100. \n\nBut how to be at 9 at turn99? We must have moved there by the action at turn98.\n\n So with 4 actions: \n  a95: U -> y96=5\n  a96: U -> y97=6\n  a97: U -> y98=7\n  a98: U -> y99=8 -> not 9.\n\nWith 5 actions: \n  a95: U -> y96=5\n  a96: U -> y97=6\n  a97: U -> y98=7\n  a98: U -> y99=8\n  a99: U -> y100=9\n\nThen at turn99, we are at 8 (not 9). \n\nSo to have y99=9, we would need to have moved +5 in 4 actions, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, I think there is a mistake in the problem's indexing. \n\nPerhaps \"y_{t1+H-1}\" is a typo and it should be \"y_{t1+H}\".\n\nBecause in many such problems, the state after the last action is the final state.\n\nI will assume that we require to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H, which is after the last action. So for H actions, we require y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nThen for our case, we need 5 actions to move from 4 to 9.\n\nH=5.\n\nAnd we already checked that the path with 5 Ups is safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is to output 5 U actions.\n\nBut let's double-check the collision at freeway7 at dt=3 (turn98) for the player being at y=7 at turn98? \n\nAt turn98, the player is at y=7. We check freeway7 at turn98 (dt=98-95=3).\n\nFreeway7 has two cars:\n\n  Car1: (0, -11, right, 4) -> at T=98, span = [ -11 + 4*3, 0 + 4*3] = [-11+12, 12] = [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n  Car2: (-48, -59, right, 4) -> [ -59 + 4*3, -48 + 4*3] = [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47, -36] -> safe.\n\nFreeway8 at turn99 (dt=4): \n  Car: (0, -11, right, 3) -> [ -11 + 3*4, 0 + 3*4] = [-11+12, 12] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo the path is safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: U\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\nTurn 99: U\n\nBut wait, at turn99, after the action, we are at y100=9, and the requirement if we interpret as y_{t1+H}=y_{100}=9, then it meets. But the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9, which would be y99=8.\n\nSo to meet the problem's requirement, we would need to be at 9 at turn99, which we cannot in 5 actions.\n\nBut then how? We might need to take more actions if there is a collision, but in this case there isn't.\n\nPerhaps we can move faster in some steps? But we can't.\n\nAnother possibility: the initial turn is 95, but maybe we can stay or move down initially to avoid a future collision? But in the direct path we didn't have any collision.\n\nBut note: at turn95, we are at y=4, and we are safe. At turn96, we move to y=5 and are safe, etc.\n\nSo the only issue is the indexing.\n\nGiven that the direct path is safe and we can reach in 5 actions (then at turn100 we are at 9), and the problem's indexing might be off, I will output the 5 U actions.\n\nIf the problem insists on y_{t1+H-1}=9, then we would need 6 actions: to be at 9 at turn100 (which is t1+5) and then we require y_{t1+H-1}=9 -> so turn100 = t1+H-1 -> 100 = 95 + H - 1 -> H=6.\n\nThen we would need to output 6 actions: the first 5 U and then one S at the end.\n\nBut that would be:\n\n  a95: U -> y96=5\n  a96: U -> y97=6\n  a97: U -> y98=7\n  a98: U -> y99=8\n  a99: U -> y100=9\n  a100: S -> y101=9\n\nThen at the beginning of turn100, we are at 9, and then we take S and stay. \n\nAnd we require y_{t1+H-1}=y_{95+5}=y_{100}=9? -> yes.\n\nBut then the sequence has 6 actions.\n\nAnd we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn100.\n\nNow, is there a collision at turn100? We are at y=9 -> not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nBut is it minimal? We could have reached at turn100 with 6 actions, but we could also have reached at turn100 with 5 actions? No, because with 5 actions we are at y100=9, but then we would have only taken 5 actions, so H=5, and then we require y_{95+4}=y99=8, not 9.\n\nSo if the problem requires y_{t1+H-1}=9, then we must have H=6: so that t1+H-1=95+5=100, and y100=9.\n\nThen we must include an extra action (S) at the end.\n\nBut the move from 4 to 9 takes 5 Ups, and then we need to stay at 9 for one more action? But then we are at 9 at the beginning of turn101, not turn100.\n\nLet me clarify with H=6:\n\n We are at turn95: y95=4.\n Action95: U -> at turn96: y96=5.\n Action96: U -> at turn97: y97=6.\n Action97: U -> at turn98: y98=7.\n Action98: U -> at turn99: y99=8.\n Action99: U -> at turn100: y100=9.\n Action100: S -> at turn101: y101=9.\n\nThen at the beginning of turn100, we are at y100=9? -> yes.\n\nAnd we require y_{t1+H-1}=y_{95+5}=y100=9. -> satisfied.\n\nBut the action at turn100 is S, which is unnecessary for moving but necessary for the sequence length.\n\nAnd we have to avoid collision at turn100? We are at y=9, so no freeway, so safe.\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence? We cannot get to 9 in fewer than 5 moves, so the earliest we can be at 9 is at turn100. Then to have y_{100}=9, we can do the 5 U's and then one S, but that is 6 actions.\n\nAlternatively, we can do the 5 U's and then at turn100 we are at 9, and that is the state after the last action (which is the 5th action at turn99). But then for the sequence of 5 actions, we have y_{100}=9, but the problem requires y_{95+4}=y99=9? -> no, we are at 8 at turn99.\n\nTherefore, to meet the letter of the problem (y_{t1+H-1}=9), we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nThe earliest turn at which we can be at 9 is turn100, because:\n  turn95: 4\n  turn96: 5\n  turn97: 6\n  turn98: 7\n  turn99: 8\n  turn100: 9\n\nSo to be at 9 at the beginning of turn100, we need to have moved there by the action at turn99.\n\nThen we require y_{100}=9.\n\nAnd we want this to be at turn t1+H-1. So 100 = 95 + H - 1 -> H=6.\n\nSo we need 6 actions: the first 5 are U (to get to 9 at turn100) and the sixth action can be anything (but we choose S) at turn100, but note that at turn100 we are already at 9, and then we take action a100 and then at turn101 we are at 9 or 8 or 10? But we only care that at the beginning of turn100 we are at 9.\n\n However, the action at turn100 is taken, and then we are at y101. But the requirement is only for y_{100}=9, not beyond.\n\n So we can do:\n\n  a95: U\n  a96: U\n  a97: U\n  a98: U\n  a99: U  -> this gets us to y100=9.\n  a100: S -> then y101=9.\n\nThen the condition is met: at the beginning of turn100 (which is before action100) we are at 9.\n\n But the action100 is taken and we are then at 9 at turn101, but we don't care.\n\n So the sequence has 6 actions.\n\n Now, is there a way to get to 9 sooner? No.\n\n But note: we might be able to get to 9 at turn100 with fewer than 6 actions? We have to have 6 actions because the last action is at turn100, and we have to include it to make H=6 so that turn100 = 95+6-1=100.\n\n Therefore, the minimal H is 6.\n\n But is there a path with H=6 that is safe? We already have the first 5 actions as U, which we checked for collisions at turns 95,96,97,98,99 (for the freeways we are on at those turns). \n\n At turn100, we are at y=9 -> no freeway, so no collision. Then we take action S at turn100, and we are at y=9 at turn101, but we don't care.\n\n So the only new collision check is for the action at turn100: but we are at y=9, so no freeway, so no check. \n\n Therefore, the sequence is safe.\n\n So the answer should be:\n\n Turn 95: U\n Turn 96: U\n Turn 97: U\n Turn 98: U\n Turn 99: U\n Turn 100: S\n\n But wait, at turn99, we are at y=8. We move to y=9 at the next turn. So at turn99, we are on freeway8.\n\n We must check freeway8 at turn99 (dt=4).\n\n Freeway8 at turn99 (dt=4): car (0, -11, right, 3) -> span = [ -11 + 3*4, 0 + 3*4] = [-11+12, 12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n So the entire sequence is safe.\n\n Therefore, the minimal H is 6.\n\n But is there a sequence with H=5? If we output 5 actions, then we require y_{95+4}=y99=9, which is not the case because we are at 8.\n\n So we must do H=6.\n\n However, the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". With H=6, we are done in 6 actions.\n\n But can we do it in 5 actions if we move down at some point? For example, to avoid a future collision, but in this case there is no collision on the direct path. But we still can't be at 9 at turn99.\n\n Therefore, the minimal H is 6.\n\n So the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: U\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\nTurn 99: U\nTurn 100: S\n}\n\nBut note: the actions are for turns 95 to 100, which is 6 actions.\n\n Alternatively, could we do without the last S? But the sequence must have H=6 actions.\n\n So we include it.\n\n But the last action could be U or D as well, but that would move us away. So S is best.\n\n Therefore, I will output this.\n\n But let me confirm the car on freeway8 at turn99: we are at y=8 at turn99, and the car on freeway8 at turn99 (dt=4) is [1,12] -> safe.\n\n And at turn100, we are at y=9 -> no check.\n\n So it's safe.\n\n Final answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 95\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,5) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 96. I have to output a sequence of actions: U for up, D for down, or S for stay, that gets me to y=9 safely.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. Cars move left or right at their speeds, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway at a turn when a car spans the x=0 position. Also, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn, so I only check for collision on the freeway I'm currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nThe player position is updated after the action, but the collision check is based on where I am at the beginning of the turn. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's position at turn T, I think. Let's see the player update: at turn t, position is (0, y_t), and after action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nBut for collision at turn T, it's based on y_T, which is the position at the start of turn T, I believe.\n\nThen, when I take action a_T, I move to y_{T+1}, but during turn T, I'm on y_T.\n\nAnd for collision, if at turn T, for freeway y_T, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nAlso, when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row during the move, so I don't check collision for the new row until the next turn.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you check cars on freeway y_T for 0 in span at time T.\n\nAfter action, you are on y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nNow, the cars: each car is defined by head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nFor left-moving, head is left, tail is right? Let's see the update.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and at T, it becomes [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIf it's left-moving, and head is at h, tail at τ, and it moves left, so h decreases, τ decreases.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway k, it lists cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-47, 0]? Let's see the notation.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], with τ and h given.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nBut for direction, it specifies \"right\" or \"left\".\n\nFor right-moving, it should be that τ is the left end, h is the right end? Because when moving right, the left end increases.\n\nLet's look at the update.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nSo, at time t_1, the span is from τ to h, with τ < h I assume, and as time increases, both increase, so it's moving right, so τ is the left end, h is the right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nHere, h and τ, with h and τ, and it moves left, so h decreases, τ decreases, so probably h is the left end, τ is the right end? Let's see.\n\nAt t_1, span is [h, τ], so if it's [left, right], then for left-moving, h should be left, τ should be right.\n\nIn the notation: for left-moving, it's given as (head, tail), but head might be the front.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"head h, tail τ\", so for left-moving, head is the front when moving left, so head is left, tail is right.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, head is right, tail is left? But in the update, for right-moving, Span is [τ, h], which is from left to right, so τ is left, h is right.\n\nInconsistency in terminology.\n\nLet me clarify.\n\nFor a car, \"head\" and \"tail\" might refer to the front and back relative to direction.\n\nSo for a left-moving car, head is the left end, tail is the right end.\n\nFor a right-moving car, head is the right end, tail is the left end.\n\nBut in the span, for collision, we care about the interval.\n\nIn the update:\n\nFor left-moving car: at t_1, span is [h, τ] with h = left end, τ = right end? But in the movement, it moves left, so both decrease.\n\nIn the example, freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so it should be right-moving.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-47, 0]? τ is tail, h is head.\n\nDirection right, so head is the right end, tail is the left end.\n\nSo Span(t_1) = [tail, head] = [left end, right end] = [-47, 0]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, head is left end, tail is right end, so Span(t_1) = [head, tail] = [left, right].\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor freeway 1: (head=0, tail=-47, direction=right, speed=48)\n\nSince direction right, head is right end, tail is left end, so span at t_1 is [tail, head] = [-47, 0]\n\nSimilarly, for others.\n\nNow, t_1 = 96, current turn.\n\nI need to find when these cars have 0 in their span at various turns for each freeway.\n\nCollision happens if at turn T, for the freeway I'm on, y_T, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nSpan at time T is computed based on t_1.\n\nFor a car, at time T, span is:\n\nIf right-moving: [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nSince at t_1, [τ, h], and moves right.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]\n\nAnd 0 is in span if min <= 0 <= max.\n\nNow, since the grid is infinite, I think, but we only care about when the span covers 0.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find for which turns T, 0 is covered by some car on that freeway.\n\nThen, when I am on a freeway at turn T, I need that for that T, no car on that freeway has 0 in span.\n\nAlso, I start at y=5 at turn t_1=96.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to move up.\n\nActions: U: y+1, D: y-1, S: y same.\n\ny between 0 and 9, so at y=0, I can't go down, similarly at y=9, can't go up, but I'm going to 9, so once I reach, I can stop.\n\nNow, the minimal number of turns H, meaning the number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nSince I start at turn t_1, after H-1 actions, I am at y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nLet me denote t as the turn number, starting from t_1.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, from t to t+H-1, I have y_{t + (H-1)} =9.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, take action, go to y_{t+1}.\n\nAfter k actions, I am at y_{t + k}.\n\nI start at turn t_1, y_{t_1} =5.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t_1, y=5.\n\nAfter first action at t_1, I go to y_{t_1+1}, and so on.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn T, so y_T =9.\n\nThen the number of turns from t_1 to T is T - t_1, and I take actions from t_1 to T-1, so H-1 = T - t_1 - something.\n\nLet the turn when I reach y=9 be T_final.\n\nThen at turn T_final, y_{T_final} =9.\n\nI started at turn t_1 with y_{t_1}=5.\n\nThe number of actions taken is T_final - t_1, because I take actions at turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., T_final -1 to reach T_final.\n\nThen y_{T_final} = y_{t_1} + sum of Δy from t=t_1 to T_final-1.\n\nAnd I need y_{T_final} =9.\n\nThe minimal H is the number of actions, which is T_final - t_1.\n\nH is the number of turns in the sequence, but let's see the sequence: {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t_1 + t.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at y_{t_1 + H}, because at each action, I move to next position.\n\nStart: at turn t_1, position y_{t_1} =5.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, position y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + k}, at turn t_1 + k +1, position y_{t_1 + k +1}.\n\nSo to have position at turn T be 9, I need y_T =9 for some T.\n\nThe actions are taken from turn t_1 to turn T-1, so the number of actions is T - t_1.\n\nThe sequence has actions for turns t_1 to T-1, so H actions, and after that, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nH is the number of actions, and y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nMinimal H means minimal number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nSince I start at y=5, and y=9 is 4 up, the minimal without cars would be 4 actions of U, reaching in 4 turns to y=9 at turn t_1 +4.\n\nBut with cars, I might need to wait or go down sometimes.\n\nH=4 is possible only if I can go up directly without collision.\n\nOtherwise, I need more turns.\n\nFirst, I need to check for each freeway from y=5 to y=8, since y=9 has no cars, and y=0 to y=4 I don't care unless I go down, but I'm at y=5 going to 9, so I might not need to go down, but to avoid collision, I might stay or move down temporarily.\n\nBut since I want minimal turns, probably I should go up as much as possible, only deviate if necessary.\n\ny=9 is the goal, no cars, so no collision there.\n\nCars are only on y=1 to 8.\n\nAt y=9, no freeway with cars, so when I am on y=9, no collision possible, I think. The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe or not, but I start at y=5, going to 9.\n\nNow, I need to find for each freeway k=1 to 8, for which turns T, there is a car with 0 in span at T.\n\nThen, when I am on freeway k at turn T, it must be that no car on k has 0 in span at T.\n\nNow, let's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nCurrent turn t_1 = 96.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=0, tail=-47, direction=right, speed=48)\n\nDirection right, so tail is left end, head is right end, span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-47, 0]\n\nAt time T, span: [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] = [-47 + 48(T - 96), 0 + 48(T - 96)]\n\n0 in span when min <= 0 <= max.\n\nSince it's moving right, min is left, max is right.\n\nSo -47 + 48(T-96) <= 0 <= 48(T-96)\n\nBecause max is 48(T-96), min is -47 + 48(T-96)\n\n0 <= 48(T-96) always true for T >= 96, since T-96 >=0, 48*0=0, so 0 <= max for all T>=96.\n\nNow min <=0: -47 + 48(T-96) <=0\n\n48(T-96) <=47\n\nT-96 <= 47/48 <1, so T-96 <= 0 since T integer, T-96 <=0, so T<=96.\n\nAt T=96, min = -47 +0 = -47 <=0, and max=0, so 0 <=0, so 0 is included.\n\nFor T>96, min = -47 +48(T-96) > -47 +0 = -47, and since T-96 >=1, min >= -47 +48 =1 >0, so min >0, so 0 < min <= max, so 0 not in span.\n\nAt T=96, min=-47, max=0, so 0 is in span.\n\nFor T=97, min= -47 +48(1) =1, max=48, so [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for higher T.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision at T=96 only, when 0 in span.\n\nFor other T, no collision.\n\nNow, freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (head=12, tail=1, direction=right, speed=12)\n\nDirection right, so tail left, head right, span at t_1: [1,12]\n\nAt T: [1 + 12(T-96), 12 + 12(T-96)] = [1 +12Δ, 12+12Δ] where Δ = T-96\n\n0 in span: 1+12Δ <=0 <=12+12Δ\n\nBut 1+12Δ >=1 >0 for Δ>=0, so min >0, so 0 not in span for any T.\n\nSecond car: (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nHead=-36, tail=-47, direction right.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt T: [-47 +12Δ, -36 +12Δ] where Δ=T-96\n\n0 in span: -47+12Δ <=0 <= -36+12Δ\n\nNow, -47+12Δ <=0 => 12Δ <=47 => Δ <=47/12≈3.916, so Δ<=3\n\n0 <= -36+12Δ => 12Δ >=36 => Δ>=3\n\nSo Δ=3, T=99\n\nAt T=99, min= -47+12*3= -47+36= -11 <=0, max= -36+36=0, so 0<=0, included.\n\nFor other Δ, not both true.\n\nSo for freeway 2, collision when T=99 for the second car.\n\nFirst car never has 0.\n\nSo freeway 2 unsafe at T=99.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? It says: | 3 | (12, 1, right, 12), (-36, -47, right, 12) |\n\nIdentical to freeway 2.\n\nSo same, unsafe only at T=99.\n\nFreeway 4: (12, 47, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so head is left end, tail is right end? Head h=12, tail τ=47.\n\nFor left-moving, span at t_1: [h, τ] = [12, 47]? But if head is front, moving left, head should be left.\n\nDirection left, so head is left end, tail is right end, so span [head, tail] = [12, 47]\n\nAt T: [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)] = [12 - 36Δ, 47 - 36Δ] where Δ=T-96\n\n0 in span: min <=0 <= max\n\nmin = 12 -36Δ, max=47-36Δ\n\n12-36Δ <=0 <=47-36Δ\n\nFirst, 12-36Δ <=0 => 36Δ >=12 => Δ >= 12/36=1/3, so Δ>=1 since integer.\n\n0 <=47-36Δ => 36Δ <=47 => Δ <=47/36≈1.305, so Δ<=1\n\nThus Δ=1, T=97\n\nAt T=97, min=12-36= -24 <=0, max=47-36=11, 0 in between.\n\nFor other Δ, not.\n\nSo freeway 4 unsafe at T=97.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4? | 5 | (12, 47, left, 36) | identical, so unsafe at T=97.\n\nFreeway 6: (54, 43, right, 6)\n\nDirection right, head=54, tail=43? Tail should be left, head right.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [43, 54]\n\nAt T: [43 +6Δ, 54 +6Δ]\n\nmin=43+6Δ >=43>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nNo collision for freeway 6 at any time.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst: (4, -7, right, 4)\n\nDirection right, head=4, tail=-7\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [-7, 4]\n\nAt T: [-7 +4Δ, 4 +4Δ]\n\n0 in span: -7+4Δ <=0 <=4+4Δ\n\n-7+4Δ <=0 => 4Δ <=7 => Δ <=7/4=1.75, Δ<=1\n\n0 <=4+4Δ always true for Δ>=0\n\nFor Δ=0, min=-7<=0, max=4>=0, yes.\n\nΔ=1, min=-7+4=-3<=0, max=4+4=8>=0, yes.\n\nΔ=2, min=-7+8=1>0, not <=0.\n\nSo for Δ=0 and Δ=1, T=96 and 97.\n\nAt T=96, Δ=0, min=-7<=0, max=4>=0.\n\nT=97, min=-3<=0, max=8>=0.\n\nSecond car: (-44, -55, right, 4)\n\nHead=-44, tail=-55, direction right.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [-55, -44]\n\nAt T: [-55 +4Δ, -44 +4Δ]\n\n0 in span: -55+4Δ <=0 <= -44+4Δ\n\n-55+4Δ <=0 => 4Δ <=55 => Δ <=55/4=13.75, Δ<=13\n\n0 <= -44+4Δ => 4Δ >=44 => Δ >=11\n\nSo for Δ from 11 to 13 inclusive.\n\nT=96+11=107, 108, 109.\n\nAt T=107, Δ=11, min=-55+44= -11<=0, max=-44+44=0, 0<=0 yes.\n\nT=108, min=-55+48= -7<=0, max=-44+48=4>=0\n\nT=109, min=-55+52= -3<=0, max=-44+52=8>=0\n\nT=110, min=-55+56=1>0, not.\n\nSo for freeway 7, unsafe when:\n\nFrom first car: T=96 and 97\n\nFrom second car: T=107,108,109\n\nSo overall unsafe at T=96,97,107,108,109.\n\nFreeway 8: (3, -8, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, head=3, tail=-8\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [-8, 3]\n\nAt T: [-8 +3Δ, 3 +3Δ]\n\n0 in span: -8+3Δ <=0 <=3+3Δ\n\n-8+3Δ <=0 => 3Δ <=8 => Δ <=8/3≈2.666, Δ<=2\n\n0 <=3+3Δ always for Δ>=0\n\nΔ=0: min=-8<=0, max=3>=0\n\nΔ=1: min=-8+3=-5<=0, max=3+3=6>=0\n\nΔ=2: min=-8+6=-2<=0, max=3+6=9>=0\n\nΔ=3: min=-8+9=1>0, not\n\nSo unsafe at T=96,97,98.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, unsafe turns:\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=96\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=99\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=99\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=97\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=97\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=96,97,107,108,109\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=96,97,98\n\ny=6 always safe, good.\n\nI start at y=5 at turn t=96.\n\nAt turn 96, I am on y=5.\n\nIs y=5 safe at t=96?\n\ny=5 freeway, unsafe at T=97, but at T=96?\n\nFor y=5, we have unsafe at T=97, from above.\n\nBut what about T=96?\n\nFreeway 5: we have car unsafe only at T=97.\n\nIs there any car on y=5 at T=96?\n\nThe unsafe turns are when collision possible.\n\nFor y=5, only unsafe at T=97, so at T=96, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nLet me list per freeway and turn.\n\nFor freeway k, unsafe turns:\n\n1: {96}\n\n2: {99}\n\n3: {99}\n\n4: {97}\n\n5: {97}\n\n6: {} always safe\n\n7: {96,97,107,108,109}\n\n8: {96,97,98}\n\nNow, at turn T, if I am on freeway k, it must not be unsafe at that T.\n\nI start at turn 96 on y=5.\n\ny=5 at T=96: since unsafe only at T=97, not 96, so safe at T=96.\n\nI can be there.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nI should go up as much as possible.\n\nMinimal path: up 4 times.\n\nBut need to check for collision.\n\nIf I go U at t=96: from y=5 to y=6.\n\nAt turn t=96, I am on y=5, take action U, so at turn t=97, I am on y=6.\n\nNow, at turn 96, I am on y=5, which is safe as above.\n\nAction U: move to y=6 at next turn.\n\nNow, at turn 97, I am on y=6.\n\ny=6 is always safe, so no problem.\n\nThen I can go U again at t=97: to y=7 at turn 98.\n\nAt turn 97, on y=6, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=7 at turn 98.\n\nAt turn 98, on y=7.\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=96,97,107,etc. T=98?\n\nFrom above, y=7 unsafe at 96,97,107,108,109. Not 98.\n\nSo at T=98, y=7 is safe? Yes, since not in unsafe set.\n\nUnsafe set for y=7: {96,97,107,108,109}, so T=98 is safe.\n\nThen I can go U to y=8 at turn 99.\n\nAt turn 98, on y=7, safe, action U, to y=8 at turn 99.\n\nNow at turn 99, on y=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=96,97,98. T=99?\n\nUnsafe: {96,97,98}, so T=99 not unsafe, so safe.\n\nThen go U to y=9 at turn 100.\n\nAt turn 99, on y=8, safe, action U, to y=9 at turn 100.\n\nNow at turn 100, on y=9, which has no cars, so safe, and I reached.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 96: at y=5, action U to go to y=6\n\nTurn 97: at y=6, action U to y=7\n\nTurn 98: at y=7, action U to y=8\n\nTurn 99: at y=8, action U to y=9\n\nNow, at turn 100, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: 4, from turn 96 to 99.\n\nH=4.\n\nBut I need to confirm no collision during this.\n\nAt each turn, when I am on a freeway.\n\nTurn 96: on y=5, which is safe at T=96.\n\nTurn 97: on y=6, always safe.\n\nTurn 98: on y=7, which is not unsafe at T=98, since unsafe only at 96,97,107,etc., so safe.\n\nTurn 99: on y=8, unsafe at 96,97,98, not 99, so safe.\n\nThen turn 100 on y=9, safe.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at turn 96,97,98,99.\n\nAfter action at turn 99, at turn 100, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, I have actions for t=96,97,98,99, H=4.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nAt turn 97, I am on y=6, which is fine.\n\nBut earlier for y=7, at turn 97 it is unsafe, but at turn 97 I am on y=6, not y=7.\n\nAt turn 97, position y=97? Turn and position.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action at T, position at T+1.\n\nIn this path:\n\nAt turn 96: y=5\n\nAction U: so y_{97} =6\n\nAt turn 97: y=6\n\nAction U: y_{98} =7\n\nAt turn 98: y=7\n\nAction U: y_{99} =8\n\nAt turn 99: y=8\n\nAction U: y_{100} =9\n\nNow, collision check at each turn T for y_T.\n\nTurn 96: y=5, safe as above.\n\nTurn 97: y=6, safe.\n\nTurn 98: y=7, safe? T=98, y=7 unsafe at {96,97,107,...}, 98 not in, so safe.\n\nTurn 99: y=8, unsafe at {96,97,98}, 99 not in, so safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is y=7 safe at T=98? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at T=99 safe.\n\nNow, but I need to reach y=9, which at turn 100.\n\nH=4 actions.\n\nBut the problem is to minimize H, and 4 seems possible.\n\nBut let me check if I can do in less? From y=5 to y=9, need at least 4 up moves, so H=4 is minimum possible, since each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nS or D would take more turns, so H=4 is minimal.\n\nAnd in this case, it works.\n\nBut earlier for freeway 7, unsafe at T=96 and 97, but at T=96 I was on y=5, not y=7; at T=97 on y=6, not y=7.\n\nAt T=98 on y=7, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut let me double-check the unsafe turns.\n\nFreeway 7: cars.\n\nFirst car: at T=96 and 97 unsafe.\n\nBut I am not on freeway 7 at those times.\n\nAt T=98, y=7: is it safe?\n\nUnsafe turns for y=7: T=96,97,107,108,109.\n\nT=98 not in, so no car has 0 in span at T=98.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at T=99: unsafe at 96,97,98, not 99.\n\ny=8 at T=99: freeway 8 has car, unsafe at T=96,97,98.\n\nAt T=99, the car position: from above, at T=99, Δ=3, min=-8+9=1>0, so [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo with 4 actions: U,U,U,U at turns 96,97,98,99.\n\nBut the sequence should be for turns starting from t_1.\n\nt_1=96.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nThen at turn 100, y=9.\n\nH=4.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be the sequence of actions.\n\nBut is there a reason I need to wait or something?\n\nPerhaps I should consider if at some point I need to avoid.\n\nBut in this case, it seems fine.\n\nMaybe I can go faster, but no, 4 is minimum.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier, but starting at turn 96, after 4 actions, at turn 100.\n\nSince I start at turn 96, and reach at turn 100, H=4.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 5 at turn 96.\n\nFreeway 5: y=5, car unsafe at T=97 only.\n\nAt T=96, for freeway 5: the car is (12,47,left,36)\n\nAt T=96, Δ=0, span [12,47], min=12>0, so 0 not in span, safe.\n\nAt T=97, Δ=1, span [12-36,47-36]=[-24,11], min=-24<=0, max=11>=0, so 0 in span, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, for others.\n\nIn my path, at turn 97 I am on y=6, not y=5.\n\ny=6 has no issue.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nBut the problem has multiple cars on some freeways, but I think I covered.\n\nFreeway 2 and 3 have unsafe at T=99, but I am not on them at that time.\n\nIn my path, at turn 99, I am on y=8, not y=2 or 3.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nPerhaps I can do it in H=4.\n\nBut let me see if H=4 is possible with the sequence.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut the current turn is t_1=96, and I need actions for t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=4, so actions at t=96,97,98,99.\n\nEach U.\n\nBut is there a collision risk when moving? But according to the note, when I move, I am not on the new row until next turn, so no issue.\n\nFor example, when I go from y=5 to y=6 at turn 96, action U, during turn 96, I am on y=5, and cars on y=5 are checked, which is safe.\n\nThen at turn 97, I am on y=6, cars on y=6 checked, safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSimilarly throughout.\n\nSo I think it works.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider if at turn 98 on y=7 is safe.\n\nFreeway 7: at T=98, what is the car positions.\n\nFirst car: (4,-7,right,4), at T=98, Δ=2, min=-7+8=1, max=4+8=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (-44,-55,right,4), at T=98, Δ=2, min=-55+8= -47, max=-44+8= -36, span [-47,-36], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo no car has 0 in span, safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at T=99: car (3,-8,right,3), at T=99, Δ=3, min=-8+9=1, max=3+9=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=4 with all U.\n\nBut the sequence is simple.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let me see the format.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for t_1=96:\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut H=4, and I reach at turn 100.\n\nPerhaps I need to specify until I reach, but after these actions, I am at y=9 at turn 100.\n\nNow, but the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", and H=4.\n\nBut is there a way with H=3? That would require reaching y=9 at turn 99, so from y=5 at turn 96, in 3 actions, but to increase y by 4, I need at least 4 actions, since each action increases by at most 1. So impossible. H=4 is minimal.\n\nIf I go down or stay, it would take more turns.\n\nSo H=4 is the minimum.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 1 is unsafe at T=96, but I am not on y=1.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I should write the answer.\n\nBut let me make sure about the direction and spans.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 7, at T=96 and 97 unsafe, but I avoid being there.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think no issue.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 96\\) is 4. The sequence of actions consists of four \"U\" (up) actions, moving the player directly to the target row without any collisions with cars on the freeways.\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance:\n- **At turn 96**: Player is on freeway \\(y = 5\\). Freeway 5 is unsafe only at turn 97 (due to a car collision), so it is safe at turn 96. Action U moves the player to \\(y = 6\\) for turn 97.\n- **At turn 97**: Player is on freeway \\(y = 6\\). Freeway 6 is always safe (no cars cause collisions at any turn). Action U moves the player to \\(y = 7\\) for turn 98.\n- **At turn 98**: Player is on freeway \\(y = 7\\). Freeway 7 is unsafe at turns 96, 97, 107, 108, and 109, so it is safe at turn 98. Action U moves the player to \\(y = 8\\) for turn 99.\n- **At turn 99**: Player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). Freeway 8 is unsafe at turns 96, 97, and 98, so it is safe at turn 99. Action U moves the player to \\(y = 9\\) for turn 100.\n- **At turn 100**: Player is on \\(y = 9\\), which has no cars and is safe.\n\nThe player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 100 after 4 actions, and \\(H = 4\\) is minimal since at least 4 up moves are required to increase the vertical position from 5 to 9.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 = 96\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 99\\) is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 96: U \\\\\nTurn 97: U \\\\\nTurn 98: U \\\\\nTurn 99: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 97. I have to output a sequence of actions starting from turn 97.\n\nThe player moves vertically: U for up (y increases by 1), D for down (y decreases by 1), S for stay (y stays the same). y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars are on each freeway from y=1 to y=8. For each freeway, there are cars defined with their positions, directions, and speeds. I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car spans x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe collision rule: collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T and for that freeway, x=0 is within the span of some car at turn T.\n\nAlso, importantly, when you move to a new y, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, if you are at y_T, and you move to y_{T+1}, you won't be on y_{T+1} at turn T, so cars on y_{T+1} at turn T don't affect you. You only care about cars on your current freeway at the current turn.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars for each freeway at turn t_1=97.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=48, tail=1, direction=right, speed=48). Since direction is right, and head=48, tail=1, that means the car is moving right, so at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]? Let me check the update rule.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\nLeft-moving: span at T is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nRight-moving: span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving, it says: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For freeway 1: (48, 1, right, 48). So head=48, tail=1. Since direction is right, and head > tail? Head=48, tail=1, so tail is smaller, so it's from left to right? But in the span, for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"head h, tail τ\", but in the update, for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nSo in the tuple (head, tail, direction, speed), \"head\" and \"tail\" might be confusing, but from context, for right-moving, head is the right end, tail is the left end. For left-moving, head is the left end, tail is the right end? Let's see.\n\nFor freeway 1: (48, 1, right, 48). Direction right, so at t_1, span is [tail, head] = [1, 48]. Yes.\n\nFor freeway 2: two cars: (24, 13, right, 12) and (-24, -35, right, 12). Both right-moving.\n\nFirst car: head=24, tail=13? But for right-moving, if tail=13, head=24, that would be [13,24], so tail=13 (left), head=24 (right).\n\nBut tail=13 > head=24? No, 13 < 24, so tail=13, head=24, so [13,24] at t_1.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-24, -35, right, 12), tail=-35, head=-24, so [-35,-24] at t_1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, for each freeway and each car, I need to find when x=0 is covered by their span at a given turn T.\n\nThe player is at y=6 at t_1=97.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is above, so I probably want to move up when possible.\n\nBut I have to avoid the freeways when cars are at x=0.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, at which turns x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, I can find the times when a car on that freeway covers x=0.\n\nFor a given freeway, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on that y, and for some car on that freeway, x=0 is in the span at T.\n\nSo for each freeway, I need the set of turns T where for some car, 0 is between the left and right ends of the span at T.\n\nSince the spans are intervals, and cars move linearly, I can find for each car the times when it covers x=0.\n\nLet ΔT = T - t_1 = T - 97.\n\nFor a right-moving car with initial span [τ, h] at t_1, speed s, span at T is [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT].\n\nx=0 is covered if τ + s ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + s ΔT.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: initial [h, τ] at t_1, span at T [h - s ΔT, τ - s ΔT], so 0 covered if h - s ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ τ - s ΔT.\n\nNow, for each car, I can solve the inequality to find when 0 is covered.\n\nSince ΔT must be integer, as turns are discrete.\n\nAlso, cars might cover x=0 for a range of turns or not at all.\n\nLet me list all freeways and their cars.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nCar: (h=48, τ=1, d=right, s=48)\n\nRight-moving, span at T: [1 + 48 ΔT, 48 + 48 ΔT]\n\nSet 1 + 48 ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 48 ΔT\n\nSince s=48, large speed.\n\nFirst inequality: 1 + 48 ΔT ≤ 0 => 48 ΔT ≤ -1 => ΔT ≤ -1/48, since ΔT integer, ΔT ≤ -1\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 48 + 48 ΔT => 48 ΔT ≥ -48 => ΔT ≥ -1\n\nSo ΔT ≥ -1 and ΔT ≤ -1? From above: ΔT ≤ -1/48 ≈ -0.0208, so ΔT ≤ -1 since integer.\n\nΔT ≤ -1 and ΔT ≥ -1, so only ΔT = -1.\n\nΔT ≥ -1 from second, ΔT ≤ -1 from first? Let's see:\n\nFirst: 1 + 48 ΔT ≤ 0 => 48 ΔT ≤ -1 => ΔT ≤ -1/48, so for integer ΔT, ΔT ≤ -1\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 48 + 48 ΔT => 48 ΔT ≥ -48 => ΔT ≥ -1\n\nSo ΔT ≥ -1 and ΔT ≤ -1, so ΔT = -1.\n\nAt ΔT = -1, T = t_1 + (-1) = 96\n\nSpan at T=96: [1 + 48*(-1), 48 + 48*(-1)] = [1-48, 48-48] = [-47, 0]\n\nSo 0 is included? -47 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, yes, 0 is the right end.\n\nAt other times? For ΔT = 0, span [1,48], 0 not in [1,48]\n\nΔT = -2: [1 + 48*(-2), 48 + 48*(-2)] = [1-96, 48-96] = [-95, -48], 0 not in.\n\nΔT = 1: [1+48,48+48]=[49,96], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=96, which is before t_1, so at current turn t_1=97, no car on freeway 1 at x=0. And for future turns, since speed high, it's gone.\n\nSo freeway 1 is clear at t_1 and after, since no car covers x=0 for T >=97.\n\nT=96 is before, so for T>=97, freeway 1 is safe.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2\n\nTwo cars:\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,12) so τ=13, h=24, s=12, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [13 + 12 ΔT, 24 + 12 ΔT]\n\n0 covered if 13 + 12 ΔT <= 0 <= 24 + 12 ΔT\n\nFirst: 13 + 12 ΔT <= 0 => 12 ΔT <= -13 => ΔT <= -13/12 ≈ -1.083, so ΔT <= -2\n\nSecond: 0 <= 24 + 12 ΔT => 12 ΔT >= -24 => ΔT >= -2\n\nSo ΔT >= -2 and ΔT <= -2? ΔT <= -1.083 so ΔT <= -2? -1.083, integer less than or equal is -2.\n\nΔT <= -13/12 = -1.083, so for integer ΔT, ΔT <= -2\n\nΔT >= -2\n\nSo ΔT = -2\n\nAt ΔT=-2, span [13 +12*(-2), 24+12*(-2)] = [13-24, 24-24] = [-11, 0], so 0 included.\n\nAt other times? For example ΔT=-1: [13-12, 24-12] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nΔT=0: [13,24], 0 not\n\nΔT=-3: [13-36,24-36]=[-23,-12], 0 not\n\nSo only at T=97 + (-2) = 95? t_1=97, ΔT=-2, T=95.\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 2: (-24, -35, right, 12) so τ=-35, h=-24, s=12\n\nSpan at T: [ -35 + 12 ΔT, -24 + 12 ΔT ]\n\n0 covered if -35 + 12 ΔT <= 0 <= -24 + 12 ΔT\n\nFirst: -35 + 12 ΔT <= 0 => 12 ΔT <= 35 => ΔT <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so ΔT <= 2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 + 12 ΔT => 12 ΔT >= 24 => ΔT >= 2\n\nSo ΔT >= 2 and ΔT <= 2.916, so ΔT = 2 or ΔT=2? ΔT <= 2.916 so ΔT <=2 since integer, ΔT >=2, so ΔT=2\n\nAt ΔT=2, span [ -35 +12*2, -24 +12*2] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0], 0 included.\n\nT=97+2=99\n\nFor other ΔT, not covered.\n\nSo for freeway 2, car 1 covers x=0 at T=95, car 2 at T=99.\n\nAt t_1=97, no car at x=0, and for future, at T=99, there is a car.\n\nBut at T=97, ΔT=0, span first car [13,24], not cover 0, second car [-35,-24], not cover, so safe at T=97.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3\n\nCars: same as freeway 2? (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nExactly same as freeway 2.\n\nSo similarly, car 1 covers x=0 at T=95, car 2 at T=99.\n\nAt T=97, no coverage.\n\nFreeway 4: y=4\n\nCars: (-24, 11, left, 36)  one car? Let's see: \"(-24, 11, left, 36)\"\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, head is left end, tail is right end? From update: left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nHere h=-24, τ=11, d=left, s=36.\n\nSpan at t_1: [h, τ] = [-24, 11]\n\nAt T: [ -24 - 36 ΔT, 11 - 36 ΔT ]\n\n0 covered if -24 -36 ΔT <= 0 <= 11 -36 ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -24 -36 ΔT <= 0 => -36 ΔT <= 24 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality, 36 ΔT >= -24 => ΔT >= -24/36 = -2/3 ≈ -0.666, so ΔT >= 0 since integer? ΔT >= -0.666, so for integer ΔT, ΔT >= 0\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 11 -36 ΔT => 36 ΔT <= 11 => ΔT <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so ΔT <= 0\n\nThus ΔT >= 0 and ΔT <= 0, so ΔT = 0\n\nAt ΔT=0, span [-24,11], 0 is in [-24,11] since -24 <=0<=11.\n\nYes.\n\nAt other times? ΔT=1: [-24-36, 11-36] = [-60,-25], 0 not in\n\nΔT=-1: [-24 -36*(-1), 11 -36*(-1)] = [-24+36, 11+36] = [12,47], 0 not in\n\nSo only at ΔT=0, T=t_1=97.\n\nSo at turn T=97, for freeway 4, x=0 is covered by the car.\n\nNow, player is at y=6 at t_1=97, not on y=4, so no collision, but if player is on y=4 at T=97, it would collide.\n\nBut since player is at y=6, it's fine.\n\nFor future, at T=97, it's covered, but at other turns not covered, so for T>97, freeway 4 is safe except at T=97 it is occupied.\n\nAt T=97, occupied, but for T!=97, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: y=5\n\nCars: same as freeway 4? \"(-24, 11, left, 36)\" same as above.\n\nSo exactly same as freeway 4, so only at T=97, x=0 covered.\n\nNow freeway 6: y=6\n\nCars: (60,49,right,6) one car? \"(60, 49, right, 6)\"\n\nh=60, τ=49? Direction right, so span at t_1: [τ, h] = [49,60]\n\nAt T: [49 + 6 ΔT, 60 + 6 ΔT]\n\n0 covered if 49 + 6 ΔT <= 0 <= 60 + 6 ΔT\n\nFirst: 49 + 6 ΔT <= 0 => 6 ΔT <= -49 => ΔT <= -49/6 ≈ -8.166, so ΔT <= -9? Since integer.\n\n-49/6 = -8.166, so ΔT <= -9? No, ΔT <= -8.166, so since integer, ΔT <= -9? -8.166, less than or equal, so ΔT <= -9? No.\n\nΔT <= -8.166, so the integers less than or equal to -8.166 are ΔT <= -9? -9, -10, etc., but -8 is greater than -8.166? -8 > -8.166, so ΔT <= -9.\n\nLet's calculate: -49/6 = -8.1666..., so ΔT must be <= -8.1666, so for integer, ΔT <= -9? ΔT = -9: -9 < -8.166, yes; ΔT = -8: -8 > -8.166? -8 is about -8.000, which is greater than -8.166, so not <= -8.166. So ΔT <= -9.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= 60 + 6 ΔT => 6 ΔT >= -60 => ΔT >= -10\n\nSo ΔT >= -10 and ΔT <= -9? From above:\n\nFirst inequality: ΔT <= -49/6 ≈ -8.166, so ΔT <= -9 since integer\n\nSecond inequality: ΔT >= -10\n\nSo ΔT >= -10 and ΔT <= -9, so ΔT = -10 or ΔT = -9\n\nAt ΔT = -9: span [49 +6*(-9), 60+6*(-9)] = [49-54, 60-54] = [-5,6], 0 in [-5,6]? -5<=0<=6, yes.\n\nAt ΔT = -10: [49 +6*(-10), 60+6*(-10)] = [49-60, 60-60] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt ΔT = -8: [49-48, 60-48] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nΔT = -11: [49-66,60-66]=[-17,-6], 0 not\n\nSo at T = 97 + (-10) = 87 and T=97 + (-9) = 88\n\nBoth before t_1=97.\n\nAt t_1=97, ΔT=0, span [49,60], not cover 0.\n\nFor future, since car moving right, and x=0 not covered for ΔT >=0, so freeway 6 is always safe for T>=97.\n\nNow freeway 7: y=7\n\nCars: (8, -3, right, 4) and (-40, -51, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: (8, -3, right, 4), so τ=-3, h=8, s=4, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [ -3 + 4 ΔT, 8 + 4 ΔT ]\n\n0 covered if -3 + 4 ΔT <= 0 <= 8 + 4 ΔT\n\nFirst: -3 + 4 ΔT <= 0 => 4 ΔT <= 3 => ΔT <= 3/4 = 0.75, so ΔT <= 0\n\nSecond: 0 <= 8 + 4 ΔT => 4 ΔT >= -8 => ΔT >= -2\n\nSo ΔT >= -2 and ΔT <= 0\n\nThus ΔT = -2, -1, 0\n\nAt ΔT=-2: span [-3 +4*(-2), 8+4*(-2)] = [-3-8, 8-8] = [-11, 0], 0 in\n\nΔT=-1: [-3-4, 8-4] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nΔT=0: [-3,8], 0 in\n\nΔT=1: [-3+4,8+4]=[1,12], 0 not\n\nSo at T=97-2=95, T=96, T=97.\n\nt_1=97, so at T=95,96,97.\n\nNow second car on freeway 7: (-40, -51, right, 4) so τ=-51, h=-40, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [ -51 + 4 ΔT, -40 + 4 ΔT ]\n\n0 covered if -51 + 4 ΔT <= 0 <= -40 + 4 ΔT\n\nFirst: -51 + 4 ΔT <= 0 => 4 ΔT <= 51 => ΔT <= 51/4 = 12.75, so ΔT <= 12\n\nSecond: 0 <= -40 + 4 ΔT => 4 ΔT >= 40 => ΔT >= 10\n\nSo ΔT >= 10 and ΔT <= 12.75, so ΔT=10,11,12\n\nAt ΔT=10: [-51+40, -40+40] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔT=11: [-51+44, -40+44] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nΔT=12: [-51+48, -40+48] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nΔT=9: [-51+36, -40+36]=[-15,-4], 0 not\n\nSo at T=97+10=107, T=108, T=109.\n\nNow for freeway 7, at T=97, both cars: first car covers at T=97, second car not until T=107.\n\nBut at T=97, first car covers x=0, as above.\n\nSo freeway 7 has coverage at T=95,96,97 from first car, and at T=107,108,109 from second car.\n\nAt T=97, covered.\n\nNow freeway 8: y=8\n\nCars: (6, -5, right, 3) one car? \"(6, -5, right, 3)\"\n\nτ=-5, h=6, s=3, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [ -5 + 3 ΔT, 6 + 3 ΔT ]\n\n0 covered if -5 + 3 ΔT <= 0 <= 6 + 3 ΔT\n\nFirst: -5 + 3 ΔT <= 0 => 3 ΔT <= 5 => ΔT <= 5/3 ≈ 1.666, so ΔT <= 1\n\nSecond: 0 <= 6 + 3 ΔT => 3 ΔT >= -6 => ΔT >= -2\n\nSo ΔT >= -2 and ΔT <= 1\n\nThus ΔT = -2, -1, 0, 1\n\nAt ΔT=-2: [-5 +3*(-2), 6+3*(-2)] = [-5-6, 6-6] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔT=-1: [-5-3, 6-3] = [-8,3], 0 in\n\nΔT=0: [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔT=1: [-5+3, 6+3] = [-2,9], 0 in\n\nΔT=2: [-5+6,6+6]=[1,12], 0 not\n\nSo at T=97-2=95, T=96, T=97, T=98.\n\nCovered at T=95,96,97,98.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the turns where x=0 is occupied (collision if player on that y at that turn):\n\ny=1: no occupancy for T>=97\n\ny=2: occupied at T=99 (from second car)\n\ny=3: same as y=2, occupied at T=99\n\ny=4: occupied only at T=97\n\ny=5: occupied only at T=97\n\ny=6: no occupancy for T>=97\n\ny=7: occupied at T=95,96,97 (from first car), and T=107,108,109 (later)\n\nBut for near future, T=95,96,97 are past or current? t_1=97, so T=95 and 96 are past, T=97 is current.\n\nAt T=97, occupied.\n\ny=8: occupied at T=95,96,97,98\n\nPlayer starts at y=6 at t=97.\n\nAt t=97, y=6 is safe, as we saw.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, no freeway, so no cars, always safe. But player must be at (0,9), so when y=9, it's fine.\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9), which is not on any freeway, so no collision issue.\n\nNow, the path: from y=6 to y=9, I need to go up 3 steps, so minimum 3 turns if I can move up each time.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on a freeway when it's occupied at that turn.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to y=8, y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think. y=0 might have something, but in this case, player starts at (0,6), and ends at (0,9), both not on freeways, but when moving through, on freeways.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so safe to be there.\n\nNow, at turn t=97, player is at y=6.\n\nI need to choose actions for t=97, t=98, t=99, etc.\n\nSince I need to go up, probably U actions.\n\nBut let's see the occupancy.\n\nFirst, at t=97:\n\n- y=4 occupied\n\n- y=5 occupied\n\n- y=7 occupied\n\n- y=8 occupied\n\ny=6 not occupied, as we have.\n\nPlayer is at y=6, so safe.\n\nNow, if I move up to y=7 at t=97, but at t=97, y=7 is occupied, so if I go to y=7 at turn t=97, I would be on y=7 at turn t=97, and since occupied, collision.\n\nAction at t: determines y_{t+1}\n\nFrom the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, based on a_t.\n\nAt turn t, player is at position (0, y_t)\n\nThen chooses action a_t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t as defined.\n\nThen at turn t+1, player is at (0, y_{t+1})\n\nCollision at turn T if player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, x=0 covered at T.\n\nSo at turn T, y_T must not be occupied.\n\nNow, for moving: if at turn T, player is at y_T, and moves to y_{T+1}, then at turn T, they are on y_T, so must not be occupied at T for y_T.\n\nAt turn T, they are not yet on y_{T+1}, so y_{T+1} occupancy at T doesn't matter.\n\nOnly the current freeway at current turn matters.\n\nBack to t=97.\n\nPlayer at y=6, which is safe at t=97.\n\nI want to move to y=9.\n\nPossible actions:\n\n- If I do U, then y_{98} = 7\n\nThen at t=98, I will be at y=7.\n\nNow, at t=98, what is occupancy?\n\nFirst, freeway 7: y=7\n\nFrom earlier, freeway 7 is occupied at t=97, but at t=98?\n\nFor freeway 7, we had occupancy at T=95,96,97 for first car, and later.\n\nAt t=98, ΔT = 98-97=1\n\nFor first car on y=7: (8,-3,right,4), at ΔT=1, span [ -3 +4*1, 8+4*1] = [1,12], not cover 0.\n\nSecond car: at ΔT=1, not in range, since it covers at ΔT=10,11,12.\n\nSo at t=98, freeway 7 is safe? No car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: y=8\n\nAt t=98, from earlier, we have occupancy at T=95,96,97,98.\n\nAt t=98, ΔT=1 for t_1=97.\n\nFreeway 8 car: (6,-5,right,3), at ΔT=1, span [ -5 +3*1, 6+3*1] = [-2,9], and 0 is in [-2,9], yes, so occupied at t=98.\n\nNow, back to action.\n\nAt t=97, if I do U, then y_{98} = 7.\n\nThen at t=98, I am at y=7, and since at t=98, y=7 is safe (no occupancy), so no collision.\n\nThen I can do another U to go to y=8 at t=99.\n\nBut at t=99, y=8 may or may not be safe.\n\nFirst, let's list occupancy for future turns.\n\nI need to know for each turn and each freeway.\n\nSince player moves slowly, I can plan step by step.\n\nStart from t=97, y=6.\n\nOption 1: Move up to y=7 at t=97 (action U at t=97), then y_{98} =7.\n\nAt t=98, at y=7, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen at t=98, I can choose action.\n\nIf I do U, then y_{99} =8.\n\nNow at t=99, I am at y=8.\n\nIs y=8 safe at t=99?\n\nFreeway 8: at t=99, ΔT = 99-97=2\n\nCar span: [ -5 + 3*2, 6 + 3*2] = [-5+6, 6+6] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12], so not covered. Safe.\n\nThen I can do U again to y=9 at t=100.\n\nAt t=100, y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision, and I reach y=9.\n\nSo sequence: t=97: U, to y=7 at t=98\n\nt=98: U, to y=8 at t=99\n\nt=99: U, to y=9 at t=100\n\nNow, check for collision.\n\nAt t=97: at y=6, safe.\n\nAt t=98: at y=7, at t=98, y=7 is safe, as span [1,12] not cover 0.\n\nAt t=99: at y=8, span at t=99 is [1,12] not cover 0, safe.\n\nThen at t=100, at y=9, safe.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nWhat about other freeways? But player is only on one y per turn, so only need to check that y at that turn.\n\nIn this path: at t=98, on y=7; t=99, on y=8; both safe at those turns.\n\nBut earlier for y=7, I thought it was occupied at t=97, but not at t=98.\n\nSimilarly y=8 occupied at t=98? At t=98, for y=8, we have occupancy at t=98? Earlier for y=8, at ΔT=1 (since t_1=97, t=98 is ΔT=1), span [-2,9], which includes 0, so at t=98, y=8 is occupied.\n\nBut in the path above, at t=98, player is at y=7, not y=8.\n\ny=8 at t=98 is occupied, but since player is not on it, no problem.\n\nPlayer is on y=7 at t=98, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=99, player moves to y=8, and at t=99, y=8 is safe, as above.\n\nSo this seems fine.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9 in minimal turns.\n\nHere H=3 turns: actions at t=97,98,99 to reach y=9 at t=100? After action at t=99, y_{100} =9, so at turn t=100, position is (0,9).\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=97 to t=97+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is reached.\n\nt_1=97, after 0 actions, at (0,6)\n\nAfter 1 action (at t=97), at t=98, position y_{98}\n\nAfter 2 actions, at t=99, position y_{99}\n\nAfter 3 actions, at t=100, position y_{100}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9, so for H=3, y_{100}=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=97 to t=99.\n\nIn the path above, with U,U,U, we reach in 3 turns.\n\nBut is there a problem?\n\nWhat about y=2 and y=3 occupied at t=99.\n\nBut player is not on them.\n\nIn this path, player goes through y=7 and y=8.\n\ny=7 at t=98: safe\n\ny=8 at t=99: safe\n\ny=9 at t=100: safe\n\nBut at t=99, y=2 and y=3 are occupied, but player is on y=8, not on y=2 or 3, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, no other issues.\n\nBut let me confirm the actions.\n\nAt t=97: action U, so from y=6 to y=7 at next turn.\n\nAt turn t=97, player at y=6, action U, so y_{98} =7.\n\nThen at t=98, player at y=7, action U, so y_{99}=8.\n\nAt t=99, player at y=8, action U, so y_{100}=9.\n\nNow, collisions:\n\nAt t=97: position y=6, freeway 6. At t=97, y=6 not occupied, safe.\n\nAt t=98: position y=7, freeway 7. At t=98, as computed, no car at x=0, safe.\n\nAt t=99: position y=8, freeway 8. At t=99, ΔT=2, span [1,12], not cover 0, safe.\n\nNo other turns.\n\nBut is there a way in fewer than 3 turns? From y=6 to y=9, need at least 3 up moves, so minimum 3 turns. So H=3 is minimal.\n\nBut perhaps I can move faster or something, but only one step per turn, so yes, H=3.\n\nBut let me check if at some point it's blocked.\n\nAnother thing: at t=97, if I do S, stay, but that would waste a turn, not better.\n\nOr D, down, but that moves away, not helpful.\n\nSo U is best.\n\nBut in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nBut let me double-check the occupancy at critical points.\n\nFirst, at t=98, freeway 7: y=7\n\nCars: first car (8,-3,right,4), at t=98, ΔT=1 from t_1=97, span [ -3 +4*1, 8+4*1] = [1,12], 0 not in, good.\n\nSecond car not relevant.\n\nAt t=99, freeway 8: car (6,-5,right,3), at ΔT=2, [ -5 +3*2, 6+3*2] = [-5+6,6+6]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nNow, what about t=99 for other freeways? For example, y=2 and y=3 are occupied at t=99, but we're not on them.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 2 and 3, they have cars that occupy at t=99.\n\nBut not an issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if staying or down is needed, but in this case, no.\n\nAnother point: at t=97, if I go up to y=7, but at t=97, y=7 is occupied, but I don't go to y=7 at t=97; I go to y=7 at t=98.\n\nAt turn t=97, I am at y=6, and after action, I will be at y=7 at turn t=98.\n\nSo at turn t=97, I am on y=6, which is safe.\n\nAt turn t=98, I am on y=7, which is safe at t=98.\n\nNo collision.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let me make sure about the freeway 7 occupancy.\n\nFreeway 7 at t=97: occupied, but I am not on it at t=97.\n\nAt t=98, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn t_1: U  (which is t=97)\n\nThen Turn t_1 +1: U (t=98)\n\nTurn t_1 +2: U (t=99)\n\nAfter that, at t=100, y=9.\n\nH=3.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be actions for t from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nH is the number of turns, meaning number of actions.\n\nIn the task: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9)\", which I think means at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nYes.\n\nSo with H=3, actions at t=97,98,99: all U.\n\nBut let me see if at t=99, when I am at y=8, and I do U to go to y=9, but at t=99, I am on y=8, which is safe, then move to y=9.\n\nIs there any car that could hit? No.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the movement, but I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the freeway 8, at t=98, it is occupied, but I am not on it then.\n\nAnother thing: the player is at (0,y), and cars are on the freeways, but since player is always at x=0, and we check when cars cover x=0.\n\nI think I covered.\n\nBut let me list the occupancy again to be thorough.\n\nFor y=1: safe all T>=97\n\ny=2: occupied at T=99 only? Earlier: at T=99, from car on y=2.\n\ny=2 at T=99: ΔT=2, for second car, span [ -35 +12*2, -24 +12*2] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], yes occupied.\n\nBut only at T=99.\n\nSimilarly y=3 same.\n\ny=4: occupied only at T=97\n\ny=5: occupied only at T=97\n\ny=6: safe all T>=97\n\ny=7: occupied at T=95,96,97; and later T=107,etc. But for T=98,99,... not occupied until 107.\n\ny=8: occupied at T=95,96,97,98; and after T=98, at T=99,100,... not occupied? At T=99, as above, not occupied.\n\nIn the sequence, we are on:\n\nt=97: y=6 safe\n\nt=98: y=7 safe (since at t=98, y=7 not occupied)\n\nt=99: y=8 safe (at t=99, y=8 not occupied)\n\nThen move to y=9.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly, but y=6 to y=9 in one step? No, only one step per turn.\n\nSo H=3 is minimum.\n\nBut just to be complete, suppose at t=97 I do S, stay at y=6, then at t=98 still y=6, safe, then I can go up later, but that takes more turns, worse.\n\nOr if I go down, worse.\n\nSo U,U,U is best.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but I think I handled.\n\nFreeway 7 has two cars, but at t=98, neither covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=3, actions: U at t=97, U at t=98, U at t=99.\n\nNow for the answer format.\n\nThe current turn is t_1=97.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: a_{t_1 + 2} = U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so for t=0: a_{t_1 +0} = a_{97}, t=1: a_{98}, t=2: a_{99}.\n\nYes.\n\nSo output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 1: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\n}\n\nBut in the box, it should be written as specified.\n\nPerhaps I need to write the actions clearly.\n\nSince t_1 is given, but in output, it's with t_1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let me confirm if there is any mistake.\n\nOne thing: at t=99, y=2 and y=3 are occupied, but since player is on y=8, no issue.\n\nBut what if at some point I need to be on those, but I don't.\n\nAnother path: suppose I go up to y=7 at t=98, but then if I stay or something, but not necessary.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 earlier, but I start at y=6, so cannot.\n\nAt t=97, if I do nothing, but worse.\n\nSo I think H=3 is achievable and minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is three U actions.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 97\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis\n- The player must move from \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 9\\), requiring at least 3 upward moves (each increasing \\(y\\) by 1), so the minimal \\(H\\) is 3.\n- Collision occurs only if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) at turn \\(T\\) and a car on that freeway spans \\(x = 0\\) at \\(T\\).\n- Occupancy of \\(x = 0\\) for each freeway at relevant turns:\n  - \\(y = 1\\): Safe for all \\(T \\geq 97\\).\n  - \\(y = 2\\): Occupied at \\(T = 99\\) (due to the second car).\n  - \\(y = 3\\): Occupied at \\(T = 99\\) (due to the second car).\n  - \\(y = 4\\): Occupied only at \\(T = 97\\).\n  - \\(y = 5\\): Occupied only at \\(T = 97\\).\n  - \\(y = 6\\): Safe for all \\(T \\geq 97\\).\n  - \\(y = 7\\): Occupied at \\(T = 95, 96, 97\\) (due to the first car); safe for \\(T = 98, 99, \\ldots\\) until \\(T = 107\\).\n  - \\(y = 8\\): Occupied at \\(T = 95, 96, 97, 98\\); safe for \\(T = 99, 100, \\ldots\\).\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) in 3 Turns\n- At turn \\(T = 97\\): Player is at \\(y = 6\\).

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0,7) at turn t1 = 98. I need to get to (0,9) with the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: U for up (y+1), D for down (y-1), S for stay (y same). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway from y=1 to y=8. Each car has a head, tail, direction, and speed. The direction tells us if it's left or right moving. For left-moving cars, the span moves left as time increases; for right-moving, it moves right.\n\nCollision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, the x=0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nImportant point: when you move to a new y, you're not on that y until the next turn. So if at turn T you're on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1}, at turn T you're still on y_T, so you only check cars on y_T for collision at T. When you arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, then you check cars on y_{T+1} at T+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is above all freeways, so once you're at y=9, no cars to worry about. y=9 is the top, and freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=9 should be safe.\n\nNow, current position: (0,7) at t=98.\n\nI need to go from y=7 to y=9. Since U increases y, I need at least two U moves to get to y=9. But I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, but going down might not help since I need to go up eventually. Since y=9 is safe, I should aim to go up directly if possible.\n\nBut there might be cars on y=7 and y=8 that I need to avoid when I'm on those rows.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car positions at different turns relative to t1=98.\n\nLet me denote t as the turn number. t1=98 is the current turn.\n\nFor any future turn T, the car spans depend on (T - t1).\n\nLet Δt = T - t1, so at turn T = t1 + Δt.\n\nFor a car with initial head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s at t1, at time T, the span is:\n\nIf left-moving: [h - s * Δt, τ - s * Δt]\n\nSince left-moving, it moves left, so head decreases.\n\nIn the rule: left-moving: span at T: [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\n\nAnd collision if x=0 is in the span for the freeway at that turn.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to see when x=0 is occupied by a car at different turns.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8, but the player is currently on y=7, so I need to consider moving to y=8 or staying or down, but down to y=6 might not help.\n\nSince I need to go to y=9, I should only consider moving up or staying, but moving down might be necessary to avoid a car, but since cars are on fixed y, and I need to be on y=8 to move to y=9, I should focus on y=7 and y=8.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway at t1=98.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): one car: (96, 49, right, 48)\n\nSince right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h] = [49,96]? No.\n\nThe notation is (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nFor right-moving cars, head is the front, so when moving right, head increases, tail increases.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, at time t, span is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] for T = t1 + Δt.\n\nSimilarly for left.\n\nAt t1, for this car on y=1: head=96, tail=49, direction=right, speed=48.\n\nSince right-moving, at t1 (Δt=0), span should be [tail, head] = [49,96], because head is larger when moving right.\n\nIn the rule: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\n\nSo at T=t1, [τ, h] = [49,96]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nNow, collision if 0 is in [low, high] for the span.\n\nAlso, cars can have multiple on one freeway.\n\nLet's list for each freeway the cars and their spans at time T.\n\nFirst, freeway y=1: only one car: (96,49,right,48)\n\nSo at time T, span: [49 + 48*(T-98), 96 + 48*(T-98)]\n\nSince right-moving.\n\nNow, freeway y=2: two cars: (36,25,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (36,25,right,12), so at T, [25 + 12*(T-98), 36 + 12*(T-98)]\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,12), so [ -23 + 12*(T-98), -12 + 12*(T-98) ]\n\nSimilarly, y=3: same as y=2? \"3 | (36, 25, right, 12), (-12, -23, right, 12)\" so identical to y=2.\n\ny=4: \"(-60, -25, left, 36)\" only one car? It says \"(-60, -25, left, 36)\" and that's it, so one car.\n\nDirection left.\n\ny=5: same, \"(-60, -25, left, 36)\" so identical to y=4.\n\ny=6: \"(-48, -59, right, 6)\" one car? (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\ny=7: \"(12, 1, right, 4), (-36, -47, right, 4)\" two cars.\n\ny=8: \"(9, -2, right, 3)\" one car.\n\nNow, player is on y=7 at t=98.\n\nI need to be on y=7 at some turns, or move to y=8, then to y=9.\n\nSince I start at y=7 at t=98, I need to decide action for t=98, which affects y at t=99.\n\nAt each turn, when I am on a y, I must not collide with cars on that y at that turn.\n\nFor example, at turn T, if I am on y_k, then for that y_k, at turn T, if 0 is in any car span on y_k, collision.\n\nIf I move to a new y, I am on the new y only at the next turn.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, from y=7, I need to go to y=8 then to y=9.\n\nI could stay on y=7 for some turns to avoid cars, or even go down, but that might increase H, so minimal H probably means going up as soon as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nMinimal H: since from 7 to 9, I need at least 2 turns: one to go to 8, one to go to 9. But if I can go directly, but no, each move changes y by at most 1, so minimum 2 moves: e.g., U at t98 to y8 at t99, then U at t99 to y9 at t100. Then H=2 turns? Let's see.\n\nH is the number of turns, and the sequence is from t= t1 to t1+H-1, so for H=2, actions at t1 and t1+1, position at t1+H-1 = t1+1 should be y=9.\n\nt1=98, position at turn t: after action at t-1? Let's see the player update.\n\nPlayer: at turn t, position is (0, y_t)\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on action a_t.\n\nSo action a_t is taken at turn t, and it affects y_{t+1}.\n\nFor example, at turn t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t: if U, y_{t+1} = y_t + 1; if D, y_{t+1} = y_t -1; if S, y_{t+1} = y_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, position is y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn T: when at turn T, position is y_T, and we check cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, to reach (0,9), so we need y_{t1 + H} = 9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nI think t is index from 0.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t=0, action at t1, t=1 action at t1+1, ..., up to t=H-1 action at t1+H-1.\n\nThen, after these actions, the position at turn t1 + H should be (0,9), I think.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nStart: at turn t1, position is (0, y_{t1}) = (0,7)\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\nThen after a_{t1+1}, at turn t1+2, y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position is y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nAnd the last action is at t1+H-1, which sets y_{t1+H}.\n\nFor y_{t1+H} = 9, and we start from y_{t1} =7, we need to increase y by 2, so at least two U actions, and possibly some S or D, but D would decrease, so to minimize H, we should avoid D and use U and S only if necessary.\n\nMinimal H is 2, if we can go directly up in two turns.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions during the moves.\n\nSpecifically, at turn t1=98, we are on y=7, so we need to check if at t=98, on y=7, is there collision? That is, is x=0 occupied on y=7 at t=98?\n\nSimilarly, when we move, at turn t=99, we will be on some y, check if collision there at t=99, and so on.\n\nFor minimal H=2:\n\n- At t=98, on y=7. Action a_{98} (which is for t=98, affecting y_{99})\n\n- Then at t=99, on y_{99}, which could be 6,7, or 8 depending on action.\n\n- Then action a_{99} for t=99, affecting y_{100}\n\nWe want y_{100} =9.\n\nSince y_{99} must be 8 to go to 9, so if we do U at t98, y99=8, then U at t99, y100=9.\n\nOr if we do S at t98, y99=7, then we need to go to 8 later, but for H=2, we need to reach y100=9, so from t98, after two actions, y100=9.\n\nIf we do U at t98, y99=8; then U at t99, y100=9.\n\nIf we do S at t98, y99=7; then to reach y100=9, we need to go from 7 to 9 in one step, but Δy is at most 1, so impossible. Similarly, if D, y99=6, then to y100=9, impossible. So for H=2, the only possibility is U at t98 to y99=8, then U at t99 to y100=9.\n\nNow, we need to check for collisions at t=98 and t=99.\n\nFirst, at t=98: we are on y=7, position (0,7) at turn 98.\n\nCheck if collision on y=7 at t=98.\n\ny=7 has cars: (12,1,right,4) and (-36,-47,right,4)\n\nAt t=98, Δt=0.\n\nFirst car: (12,1,right,4), span at t=98: [τ + s*0, h + s*0] = [1,12] for right-moving.\n\nSecond car: (-36,-47,right,4), span [ -47, -36 ]? τ=-47, h=-36, so [ -47, -36 ]\n\nNow, is 0 in [1,12]? 0 < 1, so no.\n\nIs 0 in [-47,-36]? -36 < 0 < -47? -47 < -36, so [-47,-36], 0 is greater than -36? -36 < 0, and -47 < -36, so 0 not in [-47,-36] since -47 <= x <= -36, 0 > -36.\n\nSo both spans do not contain 0, so no collision at t=98 on y=7.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, if we take action U at t=98, then at t=99, we are on y=8.\n\nAt t=99, we need to check y=8 for collision.\n\ny=8 has one car: (9,-2,right,3)\n\nAt t=99, Δt = t - t1 = 99 - 98 =1\n\nSo for this car, at T=99, span: since right-moving, [τ + s*1, h + s*1] = [-2 + 3*1, 9 + 3*1] = [-2+3, 9+3] = [1,12]\n\nτ = -2, h=9, s=3\n\n[ τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-2 + 3*1, 9 + 3*1] = [1,12]\n\nIs 0 in [1,12]? 1 to 12, 0 not in it, so no collision.\n\nThen at t=99, if we take action U, we go to y=9 at t=100.\n\nAt t=100, we are on y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nBut we need to reach at turn t1 + H -1? Let's see the turn.\n\nThe sequence: actions from t= t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nFor H=2, actions at t1 and t1+1, i.e., t=98 and t=99.\n\nPosition after actions: at turn t1+H = t1+2 =100, y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, position at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut it says reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nConflict.\n\nLet's parse.\n\nThe actions are for turns t1 to t1+H-1, so t = t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter action at t, position at t+1.\n\nSo after action at t1+H-1, position at (t1+H-1) +1 = t1+H.\n\nBut we want to reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nReach means position at that turn.\n\nSo position at turn T should be (0,9) for T = t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, at start, turn t1, position is (0,7), which is not (0,9).\n\nAfter action at t1, at turn t1+1, position is set.\n\nWe want at some turn T, position is (0,9), and T = t1 + H -1.\n\nSince we start at turn t1 with y=7, to reach y=9 at turn T, we need T - t1 actions to change y.\n\nMinimal T - t1 is 2, since from 7 to 9, need at least two up moves.\n\nSo minimal H-1 = 2? Let's see.\n\nT = t1 + H -1\n\ny_T =9\n\ny_{t1} =7\n\nThe number of turns from t1 to T is (T - t1) = (t1 + H -1 - t1) = H-1 turns.\n\nIn H-1 turns, we need to go from y=7 to y=9, which requires net +2 in y, so at least two U actions, and H-1 >=2, so H >=3.\n\nFor example, if H=3, then T = t1 + 3 -1 = t1 +2\n\nActions at t1, t1+1, t1+2\n\nPosition at turn t1+2 should be (0,9)\n\nAt turn t1, position y_t1=7\n\nAfter a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, y_{t1+1} = y_t1 + Δy_{t1}\n\nAfter a_{t1+1}, at turn t1+2, y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy_{t1+1}\n\nWe want y_{t1+2} =9.\n\nFrom y_t1=7, to y_{t1+2}=9, so we need two U actions, or one U and something, but since Δy is +1,0,-1, to increase by 2 in two steps, we must have two U actions, and no D or S that decrease net, but S would keep y the same, so for net +2 in two steps, must be U and U.\n\nSo actions: a_{t1} = U, then y_{t1+1} =8\n\nThen a_{t1+1} = U, then y_{t1+2} =9\n\nFor H=3, actions at t1, t1+1, t1+2? H actions from t=0 to H-1 index.\n\nSequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so for H=3, actions at t1+0, t1+1, t1+2, i.e., turns 98,99,100 for t1=98.\n\nThen position at turn (t1 + H -1) = t1 + 3 -1 = t1 +2 =100 should be (0,9).\n\nYes.\n\nAt turn t1+2=100, y=9.\n\nNow, during the sequence, we have positions at turn t1, t1+1, t1+2.\n\nAt each turn, we need no collision.\n\nAt turn t1: on y_t1 =7\n\nAt turn t1+1: on y_{t1+1}, which depends on action at t1\n\nAt turn t1+2: on y_{t1+2}, which depends on action at t1+1\n\nFor the minimal H=3 case with two U:\n\n- Action at t1 (98): U, so y_{t1+1} = y_{99} =8\n\n- Action at t1+1 (99): U, so y_{100} =9\n\nNow, collisions to check:\n\nAt turn t1=98: on y=7, as before, no collision, we checked.\n\nAt turn t1+1=99: on y=8 (since we moved up)\n\nNow, at turn 99, on y=8, check cars on y=8 at turn 99.\n\ny=8 car: (9,-2,right,3)\n\nAt turn 99, Δt = T - t1 =99-98=1\n\nSpan: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-2 + 3*1, 9 + 3*1] = [1,12]\n\n0 not in [1,12], so safe.\n\nAt turn t1+2=100: on y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nBut we also have action at t1+2=100? For H=3, actions up to t1+2, but at turn t1+2, we take action, which affects y_{t1+3}, but we don't care, since we only need position at turn t1+2 to be 9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 100, we are at y=9, and we take action, say U or whatever, but y=9, U would go to 10, but y max 9, so probably S or not, but since we reach at turn t1+2=100, position is already 9, so action at t100 is not affecting the position at t100, but at t101.\n\nBut for collision, at turn t100, we are on y=9, safe.\n\nSo for H=3, it seems possible with actions: U at t98, U at t99, and then at t100, we need an action, but since we reach at turn t1+H-1= t1+2=100, and y=9, we can do anything, say S.\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=3, we need three actions: a_{98}, a_{99}, a_{100}\n\nBut a_{100} is for turn 100, which sets y_{101}, but we don't care about y_{101}, only that at turn 100, y=9.\n\nIn this case, with a_{98}=U, a_{99}=U, then at turn 100, y=9.\n\nThen a_{100} can be S, for example.\n\nAnd at turn 100, on y=9, safe.\n\nNo collision at any point.\n\nBut is there a problem?\n\nEarlier I thought H=3 is minimal, but let's confirm if H=2 is possible.\n\nIf H=2, then T = t1 + H -1 =98 +2 -1=99\n\nReach at turn 99.\n\nPosition at turn 99 should be (0,9)\n\nNow, at turn t1=98, position y=7.\n\nAfter action a_{98}, at turn 99, y_{99} = y_{98} + Δy_{98}\n\nWe want y_{99}=9.\n\nBut y_{98}=7, so Δy_{98} must be +2, but Δy is only +1,0,-1, so impossible to go from 7 to 9 in one step. Thus H=2 impossible.\n\nMinimal H is 3.\n\nWith H=3, we can do it as above.\n\nBut we need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=3, actions at t98, t99, t100.\n\nWith a98=U, a99=U, a100=S (or anything, since position at t100 is already 9).\n\nBut at turn t99, we are on y=8, which we checked is safe.\n\nIn the car state, y=8 has a car, but at t99, span [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t98, y=7 safe.\n\ny=7 at t98: cars (12,1,right,4) span [1,12], 0 not in; (-36,-47,right,4) span [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut the problem is to find minimal H, and sequence.\n\nIs H=3 achievable? Seems so.\n\nBut perhaps for other freeways, but since we only care about the rows we are on.\n\nIn this path, we are only on y=7 at t98, y=8 at t99, and y=9 at t100.\n\nWe don't go to other rows, so cars on other rows don't matter.\n\nSo with actions: a_{98} = U, a_{99} = U, a_{100} = S (or U, but y=9, U would be invalid? y must be in [0,9], so U from 9 might be invalid.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if at y_t=9, U would make y_{t+1}=10, but since must be in [0,9], probably it stays or something, but the rule says y_{t+1} in [0,9], but doesn't specify if it clips or not.\n\nLook: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where ... , y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\"\n\nIt doesn't say what happens if out of range, but it says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so probably it is constrained, meaning if action would take it out, it stays or something, but to be safe, better to use S when at boundary.\n\nBut in this case, at t100, we are at y=9, so a_{100} should be S to stay, or if we do U, it might not change, but to avoid issue, use S.\n\nSimilarly, at y=0, D might not decrease.\n\nBut here, since we are at y=9, S is fine.\n\nSo sequence: Turn 98: U, Turn 99: U, Turn 100: S\n\nBut H=3, and we reach at turn t1+H-1=98+3-1=100.\n\nNow, but the answer should have actions starting from t1.\n\nIn the format: Turn t1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nBut t1=98.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=3 seems minimal.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach faster? No, as above.\n\nPerhaps with H=3 but different actions, but this should work.\n\nBut let me double-check the cars at t99 on y=8.\n\nt1=98, t=99, Δt=1\n\ny=8 car: (9,-2,right,3)\n\nAt T=99, span [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-2 + 3*1, 9 + 3*1] = [1,12]\n\n0 not in [1,12], yes.\n\nAt t=98, y=7 cars: first car (12,1,right,4) span [1,12] at t=98, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car (-36,-47,right,4) span [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\ny=9 no cars.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut the player is at (0,7) at t=98, which is safe.\n\nThen after U, at t=99 on (0,8), which is safe.\n\nThen after another U, at t=100 on (0,9).\n\nThen action at t=100, say S.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nBut the task is to reach (0,9), avoiding collisions, and minimal H.\n\nH=3 is minimal.\n\nBut let me see if I can do with H=3 but without the last action, but no, for H=3, we need three actions.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at an earlier turn, but from t=98, earliest to reach y=9 is at t=100, which is t1+2 = t1+H-1, so H-1=2, H=3.\n\nt1+H-1 = t1+2, so H=3.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the car list, for other freeways, but I don't think they affect since I'm not on them.\n\nFor example, y=6 or others, but I'm not there.\n\nSo I think this works.\n\nBut the problem might be that at some point, when I move, but in this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if the cars are moving and when they might hit x=0.\n\nFor example, on y=8, the car span at t=99 is [1,12], so x=0 is safe.\n\nNow, at other times, but since I'm only there at t=99, it's fine.\n\nSimilarly for y=7 at t=98.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see when x=0 is occupied on y=7 or y=8.\n\nFor y=7 at time T:\n\nCars: (12,1,right,4) and (-36,-47,right,4)\n\nFirst car: span [1 + 4*(T-98), 12 + 4*(T-98)] since right-moving.\n\nSet 0 in span: 1 + 4Δt <= 0 <= 12 + 4Δt, but 1 + 4Δt >=1 >0 for Δt>=0, so never <=0, so 0 never in this span.\n\nSimilarly, second car: span [-47 + 4*(T-98), -36 + 4*(T-98)]\n\nSet -47 + 4Δt <= 0 <= -36 + 4Δt\n\nBut -47 + 4Δt <=0 implies 4Δt <=47, Δt <=11.75\n\nAnd 0 <= -36 + 4Δt implies 4Δt >=36, Δt >=9\n\nSo for Δt from 9 to 11, 0 in span? Let's see.\n\n-47 + 4Δt <= 0 <= -36 + 4Δt\n\nFor example, Δt=9: low = -47 + 36 = -11, high = -36 + 36 =0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included.\n\nAt T=98+9=107, span [ -47 + 4*9, -36 + 4*9] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0], so 0 is in [ -11, 0].\n\nSimilarly, Δt=10: [-47+40, -36+40] = [-7,4], 0 in it.\n\nΔt=11: [-47+44, -36+44] = [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nΔt=12: [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo on y=7, collision at T=107,108,109? T=107,108,109.\n\nBut at t=98, not collision.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\ny=8 car: (9,-2,right,3)\n\nSpan: [-2 + 3*(T-98), 9 + 3*(T-98)]\n\nSet 0 in [-2 + 3Δt, 9 + 3Δt]\n\n-2 + 3Δt <=0 <= 9 + 3Δt\n\nFirst, -2 + 3Δt <=0 => 3Δt <=2 => Δt <= 2/3, not integer, so never <=0 since -2 + 3Δt, for Δt=0, -2<0, but 0 <= -2? 0 <= -2 is false.\n\n0 in [low, high] iff low <= 0 <= high.\n\nFor this span, low = -2 + 3Δt, high = 9 + 3Δt\n\nNow, low <=0: -2 + 3Δt <=0 => 3Δt <=2 => Δt <= 2/3, since Δt integer, Δt=0: low=-2<=0, but 0 <= high? high=9 + 3*0=9, 0<=9 true, but low <=0 and 0 <= high.\n\nAt Δt=0: low=-2 <=0, high=9 >=0, so 0 in [-2,9]? -2 to 9, yes, 0 is between -2 and 9.\n\nAt t=98, Δt=0, span [τ, h] = [-2,9] for this car? Earlier I thought at t=98, but let's see.\n\nAt t1=98, for y=8 car, head=9, tail=-2, right, so span at t=98: [τ, h] = [-2,9], since right-moving, [tail, head] = [-2,9]\n\nYes, and 0 is in [-2,9], so at t=98, on y=8, there is a car covering x=0?\n\nBut at t=98, the player is not on y=8, we are on y=7.\n\nBut for when we are on y=8.\n\nAt t=99, we have span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nBut at t=98, if someone were on y=8, it would collide.\n\nBut in our case, at t=99, we are on y=8, and span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nNow, when is x=0 occupied on y=8.\n\nSpan low = -2 + 3Δt, high=9 + 3Δt\n\nSet low <=0 <= high.\n\nlow <=0: -2 + 3Δt <=0 => 3Δt <=2 => Δt <= 0.666, so for Δt=0, low=-2<=0\n\nhigh=9+3Δt >=0 always for Δt>=0.\n\nAt Δt=0, high=9>0.\n\nNow, 0 <= high is true since high >=9>0 for all Δt.\n\nBut low <=0: for Δt=0, low=-2<=0 true; for Δt=1, low=1>0, false.\n\nSo only at Δt=0, i.e., t=98, low=-2<=0 and high=9>=0, so 0 in span.\n\nFor t>98, Δt>=1, low= -2+3*1=1>0, so low>0, 0 not <= low, so not in span.\n\nThus, on y=8, collision only at t=98, not at other times.\n\nAt t=99, safe.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7, we have collision at t=107,108,109, but not at t=98.\n\nSo in our plan, no issue.\n\nTherefore, with H=3, actions: a_{98}=U, a_{99}=U, a_{100}=S\n\nNow, the sequence should be written.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nTurn 100: S\n\nBut H=3.\n\nBut let me see if I can do with smaller H, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at turn 99, but to be at y=9 at turn 99, from y=7 at turn 98, impossible in one step.\n\nSo H=3 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, for t=100, action S, but since we reach at turn 100, and it's safe.\n\nPerhaps I don't need the last action if I can reach earlier, but I can't.\n\nAnother thing: the player starts at (0,7) at turn 98, and we take action immediately.\n\nBut in this case, it works.\n\nPerhaps for y=6 or others, but I'm not going there.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut let me check the car state again.\n\nIn y=7, there is another car (-36,-47,right,4), which we considered.\n\nBut at t=98, not colliding.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think minimal H is 3 with the sequence above.\n\nBut the answer should be in a box.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but in the answer, it seems we just need to output the sequence, and H is implied.\n\nIn the format, it lists the actions with turns.\n\nSo for this, it should be:\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nTurn 100: S\n\nBut S at 100, but since at turn 100 we are at y=9, and we take S, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps I can set a_{99} such that I reach earlier, but no.\n\nAnother point: at turn t1+H-1=100, position is 9, and we take action, which is for the next, but it's part of the sequence.\n\nBut in terms of reaching, it's done.\n\nPerhaps H can be less if I start from different point, but no.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nBut let me see the initial position: (0,7) at turn 98.\n\nAnd cars.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if moving down helps, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=6, then I need to come up, more actions, H larger.\n\nSo no need.\n\nThus, minimal H=3 with the sequence.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 98: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 99: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 100: S \\end{array} }\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so for t1=98.\n\nAnd H=3.\n\nBut in the box, just the actions.\n\nPerhaps I need to specify H, but I think the sequence implies H.\n\nIn the task, it says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in answer format, it only shows the sequence.\n\nSo probably just list the actions.\n\nNow, but I recall that for y=8, at t=98, there is a car covering x=0, but we are not there at that time.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps the player could do something else, but not necessary.\n\nI think this is fine.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 98\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1\\) with minimal \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 3, as it takes at least two turns to increase the y-coordinate from 7 to 9 (each action changes y by at most 1), and the sequence must include actions for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 100\\).\n\n### Collision Check for the Sequence:\n- **At turn 98**: Player is on y=7.  \n  Cars on y=7 at turn 98:  \n  - (12, 1, right, 4): Span = [1, 12] (0 not in span).  \n  - (-36, -47, right, 4): Span = [-47, -36] (0 not in span).  \n  No collision.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get the player from (0,8) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing their y-position by +1, -1, or 0, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where there's a car such that 0 (the x-position) is within the car's span at that turn. Also, when moving to a new freeway, you're not on that freeway until the next turn, so you only check the car on your current y-position at each turn.\n\nThe initial position is y=8, and I need to reach y=9. Since y=9 is the top, and there are no cars on y=9 because freeways are from y=1 to 8, as per the vertical axis y=0,1,...,9, and cars are on freeways y=1 to 8. y=0 and y=9 are probably safe, but I need to be at (0,9), so when I'm at y=9, there are no cars to worry about.\n\ny=9 has no freeway, so it should be safe. Similarly, y=0 might be safe, but I start at y=8 and need to go to y=9, so I might not need to go to y=0.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so once I'm at y=9, I'm done.\n\nBut I start at y=8, so to reach y=9, I need to move up once. But I have to make sure that when I move, I don't collide with cars on y=8 or during the move.\n\nLet's see the car positions at turn t1=99.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car spans at turn t1=99.\n\nFor each car, given head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nDirection: left-moving or right-moving.\n\nIn the table, for freeway k, which is y=k.\n\nCars are listed with (h, τ, d, s)\n\nFor left-moving cars: the span is [h, τ] at t1, and it moves left, so h decreases, τ decreases.\n\nIn the update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → wait no, it says for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h]? That might be a typo.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\nFor car on freeway i, head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nThen:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut for left-moving, if head is at h and tail at τ, and it's moving left, head should be the leading part, so if moving left, head is leftmost? I think I need to clarify the head and tail.\n\nTypically, head is the front of the car, so for left-moving, head is on the left, tail on the right, so span from left to right is [head, tail] but since it's moving left, both decrease.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ] with h and τ, and since moving left, h - s dt, τ - s dt.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, it says: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSo for right-moving, they define span as [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end? That seems inconsistent.\n\nLet's see: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is smaller, h is larger, since it's moving right, so [τ, h] with τ < h, and Span(T) = [τ + s dt, h + s dt], so τ is the left end, h is the right end.\n\nBut in the left-moving case, Span(t1) = [h, τ], and it moves left, so if h is head, for left-moving, head should be left, so [h, τ] with h < τ? Or h > τ?\n\nI think there might be confusion in the notation.\n\nLet me look back.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nIf it's moving left, and h is head, I assume head is the front, so for left-moving, head is leftmost, so h should be less than τ? Or greater?\n\nSuppose the car is moving left, so left is decreasing x. Head is at position x_h, tail at x_t, with x_h < x_t if head is left, so span [x_h, x_t].\n\nThen when moving left, both decrease, so at T, [x_h - s dt, x_t - s dt].\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head is rightmost, so x_h > x_t, span [x_t, x_h], and moving right, [x_t + s dt, x_h + s dt].\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, they have Span(t1) = [h, τ], which might imply h is left, τ is right, so h < τ.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], which might imply τ is left, h is right, so τ < h.\n\nIn the car state table, for example, freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-95, -48]? But -95 < -48, so τ = -95, h = -48, so left end -95, right end -48.\n\nThen Span(t1) = [-95, -48]\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car, e.g. freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, Span(t1) = [h, τ] = [48, 83], so h=48, τ=83, and since left-moving, head at 48? But 48 < 83, so if moving left, head should be at smaller x, but here h=48, τ=83, 48<83, so if moving left, head at 48 (left), tail at 83 (right), so span [48,83], moving left, decreasing.\n\nYes.\n\nIn general, for any car, the span at t1 is given with min and max, but we need to interpret based on direction.\n\nFor collision, we care when 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway we are on.\n\nAlso, the player is at x=0 always, I think, since it says position (0, y_t), so x=0 fixed, only y changes.\n\nSo we only care about whether 0 is in the car's span at that turn for the current y.\n\nNow, current turn t1=99, player at y=8.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nBut y=9 has no cars, so to reach y=9, I need to be at y=8 and then move up to y=9.\n\nBut when I am at turn T, if I am at y_T, I might collide if there is a car on y_T with 0 in span.\n\nThen when I move, if I move to a new y, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I decide action to go to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I am on y_T, so I check cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nAnd if I move, I am not on the new row until the next turn.\n\nSo for me to reach y=9, I need to be at y=8 at some turn, and then take action U to go to y=9 at the next turn.\n\nAt the turn when I take U, I am at y=8, so I need that at that turn, on y=8, there is no car with 0 in span.\n\nThen at the next turn, I am at y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nSo the key is to find a turn when I can be at y=8 and there is no car on y=8 that has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nSince I start at y=8 at turn t1=99, I might be able to move immediately if it's safe, or I may need to wait or move away and come back.\n\nFirst, let's check if at turn t1=99, on y=8, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 8: cars: (12, 1, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [1, 12], since τ=1, h=12, so min=1, max=12.\n\nSo span at t1: [1,12]\n\nNow, 0 is not in [1,12], since 1>0, so 0 not in span, so at turn t1, on y=8, no collision.\n\nTherefore, I can move up immediately.\n\nAction at turn t1: U, so y becomes 9, and I reach the goal.\n\nBut is that it? Seems too easy, but let me confirm.\n\nPlayer at turn t1: position (0,8)\n\nI take action U: so y_{t1+1} = 8 + 1 = 9\n\nAt turn t1, I am on y=8, I check cars on y=8: span [1,12], 0 not in [1,12], so safe.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, I am on y=9, no cars, so I have reached (0,9).\n\nAnd H=1, since only one action.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so t=0 is turn t1, action a_{t1}.\n\nThen after H-1 actions, at turn t1 + (H-1), I reach y=9? Let's see.\n\nAfter k actions, I am at turn t1 + k.\n\nStart at turn t1, position y.\n\nAfter action a_t at turn t, I move to y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position (0, y_T), which was set by previous action.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt the beginning of turn T, I am at position (0, y_T).\n\nI take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nThen at turn T, I am on y_T, so I check for collision on y_T at turn T.\n\nIf no collision, I survive, and move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nIn this case, at turn t1=99, I am at y=8.\n\nI take action a_{t1} = U, so y_{100} = 9.\n\nAt turn t1=99, I am on y=8, check cars on y=8: span [1,12] at t1, 0 not in [1,12], safe.\n\nThen at turn t1+1=100, I am on y=9, no cars, goal reached.\n\nSo with one action, I reach at turn t1+1.\n\nH is the number of turns? The minimal number of turns H, and sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so for t=0, turn t1 + 0 = t1, action a_{t1}\n\nAfter H actions? Let's see the index.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nSo actions taken at turns t1 to t1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter taking these H actions, I should be at y=9 at turn (t1 + H - 1) + something.\n\nAfter taking action at turn T, I am at y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nSo after taking action at turn t1 + H - 1, I am at y_{t1 + H} at turn t1 + H.\n\nAnd I need to be at y=9 at that point.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nLet me read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nNo, it says: \"to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nIn the task: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\ny_t is the position at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, position is (0, y_t)\n\nAfter action at turn t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo at turn t, I am at y_t, take action, go to y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nTo have y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9, that means at turn t1 + H - 1, I am at position y=9.\n\nAnd I take actions from turn t1 to turn t1 + H - 2? Let's see.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1 for offset, so actions at turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0, action at t1, affects y_{t1+1}\n\nt=1, action at t1+1, affects y_{t1+2}\n\n...\n\nt=H-1, action at t1 + H - 1, affects y_{t1 + H}\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t1 + H - 1, which is set by the action at turn t1 + H - 2.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T, which is the result after action at turn T-1, for T > t1.\n\nAt turn t1, y_{t1} is given.\n\nThen action at turn t1 determines y_{t1+1}\n\nAction at turn t1+1 determines y_{t1+2}, etc.\n\nSo to have y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9, that means that the position at turn t1 + H - 1 is 9, which is set by the action at turn t1 + H - 2.\n\nThe actions are taken from turn t1 to turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nFor y_{t1 + H - 1} to be 9, it must be that the action at turn t1 + H - 2 is such that it sets y_{t1 + H - 1} to 9, or if H-1 =0, but let's see.\n\nCase: if H=1, then actions from t=0 to 0, so only one action at turn t1.\n\nAfter this action, y_{t1+1} is set.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H - 1} = y_{t1 + 1 - 1} = y_{t1} =9? But y_{t1} is given as 8, not 9.\n\nContradiction.\n\nFor H=1, t1 + H -1 = t1 +1 -1 = t1, y_{t1} =8 ≠9.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for H=1, y_{t1} must be 9, but it's 8, so impossible with H=1.\n\nWith H actions, we reach at turn t1 + H -1 with y=9.\n\nWith no actions, at turn t1, y=8.\n\nAfter one action, at turn t1+1, y could be 9 if action U.\n\nBut turn t1+1 is after t1.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=9 is turn t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, turn t1 +1 -1 = t1, but at t1, y=8.\n\nIf H=2, turn t1 +2 -1 = t1+1, we need y_{t1+1}=9.\n\nWhich can be achieved by action at turn t1: U.\n\nSimilarly, if H=3, turn t1+2, y=9, etc.\n\nSo minimal H should be 2, since from y=8 to y=9 takes one step to change y.\n\nAction at turn t1: U, then at turn t1+1, y=9.\n\nAnd turn t1+1 = t1 + 2 -1? H=2, t1 + H -1 = t1 +2 -1 = t1+1, yes.\n\nSequence: actions at t=t1 and t=t1+1? For H=2, actions from t=0 to 1, so two actions: a_{t1} and a_{t1+1}.\n\nBut to reach y_{t1+1}=9, we only need the action at turn t1 to be U, and action at turn t1+1 doesn't matter, but we have to specify actions for all turns until we reach.\n\nThe sequence must include actions until the turn before we reach? No.\n\nWe need to reach at turn t1 + H -1, so for H=2, reach at turn t1+1.\n\nThe actions are from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -1, which for H=2, turns t1 and t1+1.\n\nAt turn t1, we take action that affects y_{t1+1}, and at turn t1+1, we take action that affects y_{t1+2}, but since we already reached at turn t1+1, y_{t1+1}=9, so the action at turn t1+1 might not be needed, but we have to specify it, or perhaps we can set it to S or something.\n\nBut in this case, for the purpose of reaching, once we reach, we don't care, but we need to specify the sequence.\n\nBack to the point.\n\nIn this case, at turn t1, y=8, if I take U, then y_{t1+1}=9, so at turn t1+1, I am at (0,9).\n\nAnd we need to reach at turn t1 + H -1 with y=9.\n\nSo for H=2, t1 + H -1 = t1 +1, which matches.\n\nNow, at turn t1, when I am on y=8, I need no collision.\n\nAs I checked, at turn t1=99, on y=8, car span [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen I can take U to go to y=9 at next turn.\n\nBut is there a car on y=8 at turn t1? Yes, but 0 not in span.\n\nBut the car is moving, so at other turns it might be different.\n\nBut at turn t1, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if I wait, but since I can move immediately, H=2 should be possible.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: only one car: (12, 1, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, so at t1, span [τ, h] = [1,12], since τ=1, h=12.\n\n0 not in [1,12], so safe.\n\nNow, but the car is moving right with speed 3, so at later turns, the span changes.\n\nBut at turn t1, it's fine.\n\nMoreover, when I take action U at turn t1, I go to y=9 at turn t1+1, and no need to be on y=8 anymore.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nBut why are there other freeways? I don't care since I'm only on y=8 at turn t1.\n\nUnless I need to consider if I have to move through other rows, but here I go directly to y=9 from y=8.\n\ny=9 is adjacent.\n\nBut is y=9 a freeway? No, freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 is safe.\n\nSo with one move: action U at turn t1.\n\nThen H=2, since number of turns H, and we reach at turn t1+1 = t1 + H -1 with H=2.\n\nSequence: action at t1: U, and since H=2, we need two actions? Actions from t=0 to H-1=1, so two actions: a_{t1} and a_{t1+1}.\n\nBut at turn t1+1, I am already at y=9, so I don't need to do anything, but I have to specify an action, say S.\n\nThe problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so for H=2, two actions.\n\nBut the first action gets me to y=9 at turn t1+1, and the second action at turn t1+1, I can do anything, since I'm already at goal, but I need to reach at turn t1 + H -1 = t1+1 for H=2, so at that turn I am there, and I take action after, but the action at that turn doesn't affect the position at that turn.\n\nPosition at turn T is y_T, set before the action at turn T.\n\nAction at turn T changes y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, I take action a_T to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, I am on y_T, so I check cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nThen I take action, and at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, check cars there.\n\nIn this case, to have y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, with H=2, we want y_{t1 +1} =9.\n\nThis is set by action at turn t1.\n\nAction at turn t1+1 sets y_{t1+2}, but we don't care about y_{t1+2}.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to specify a_{t1} and a_{t1+1} for H=2.\n\na_{t1} should be U to set y_{t1+1}=9.\n\na_{t1+1} can be S, for example, since it doesn't matter.\n\nBut we need to make sure that at turn t1+1, when I am on y=9, it is safe, which it is.\n\nSimilarly, collision only on freeways y=1-8, y=9 no car.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut in this case, with a_{t1}=U, I reach y=9 at turn t1+1.\n\nNow, but let me check if at turn t1, on y=8, it is indeed safe.\n\nCar on y=8: (12, 1, right, 3)\n\nSpan at t1: [1,12], 0 not in, yes.\n\nBut the car is moving right, speed 3, so at turn t1+1, span would be [1+3,12+3] = [4,15], 0 not in.\n\nBut I am not on y=8 at turn t1+1, I am on y=9.\n\nSo fine.\n\nPerhaps I should verify if there are any constraints that prevent moving up.\n\nBut why are other freeways given? Maybe I need to consider if I have to go down or something, but no, I can go directly.\n\nUnless at y=8 it is not safe at some points, but at t1 it is.\n\nBut t1=99, and car positions are given at t1.\n\nNow, for other freeways, since I don't visit them, I don't care.\n\nBut let me see the car on y=7, for example, but I am not on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, y=6, etc.\n\nAll irrelevant for this move.\n\nSo I think with one action U at t1, I can reach.\n\nBut H should be 2, with actions at t1 and t1+1.\n\na_{t1} = U\n\na_{t1+1} = S (or anything)\n\nBut the sequence should be for the turns to reach at t1+1.\n\nPerhaps I can have H=1, but as we saw, impossible since y_{t1}=8 ≠9.\n\nSo minimal H=2.\n\nBut let me confirm the answer format.\n\nThe box should contain:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n\nfor H=2.\n\nBut a_{t1+1} can be S, for example.\n\nSince the goal is reached at turn t1+1, and I take action at that turn, but it doesn't affect the position at that turn.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut is there a reason I cannot move immediately?\n\nPerhaps I misread the car on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: (12, 1, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [1,12], yes.\n\n0 not in.\n\nBut the values: τ=1, h=12, so x from 1 to 12, 0 not included.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let me see if at exactly turn t1, it is safe.\n\nPerhaps the car spans include the position, and 0 might be on boundary, but here 0 not in [1,12], open or closed? It says \"0 in Span(T)\", and span is [min, max], I assume inclusive.\n\nBut 0 < 1, so not included.\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nBut there is a car on y=2, for example, with (0, -11, right, 12), but I am on y=8, not y=2.\n\nSo irrelevant.\n\nUnless I need to consider when moving, but no, collision only when on the freeway at that turn.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,8), and I need to go to (0,9), so moving up is straightforward.\n\nBut let me see the car on y=8 again.\n\nFreeway 8: (12, 1, right, 3)\n\nAlso, is there only one car? Yes.\n\nPerhaps I need to see if at other turns, but I don't need to.\n\nAnother thing: the initial position is (0, y_{t1}) = (0,8), so at turn t1, on y=8.\n\nIf I stay or move, but I want to move up.\n\nPerhaps I should check if moving up is possible, but I think it is.\n\nBut why is the turn t0=99 given? Maybe to compute the car positions.\n\nBut at t1=99, it's given.\n\nPerhaps for other freeways, if I had to go through, but I don't.\n\nI think I might be missing something.\n\nAnother thought: when I move to y=9, at turn t1, I am on y=8, take U, so at turn t1+1, on y=9.\n\nBut is y=9 a valid position? y=0 to 9, so yes.\n\nAnd no cars on y=9.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that to be on y=9, I need to have moved from y=8, and at the move turn, on y=8 it must be safe.\n\nWhich it is at t1.\n\nBut let me double-check the car state.\n\nFreeway 8: (12, 1, right, 3)\n\nWith direction right, so τ=1, h=12, span [1,12] at t1.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps the head and tail are mislabeled.\n\nIn the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 8: (12, 1, right, 3)\n\nSo h=12, τ=1, d=right.\n\nFor right-moving, as per update, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [1,12]\n\nYes.\n\nIf it were left-moving, it would be [h, τ], but it's right.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps at turn t1, the car is at [1,12], but since it's moving, and t1=99, but no issue.\n\nAnother thing: are there multiple cars on the same freeway?\n\nFor y=8, only one car.\n\nBut for other freeways, there are multiple, like y=2 has two cars.\n\nBut I don't care.\n\nSo I think with H=2, action at t1: U, action at t1+1: S.\n\nBut to minimize H, H=2 is minimal possible since from 8 to 9 takes at least one step.\n\nH is the number of turns, and we reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nWith H=1, reach at t1, but y_t1=8≠9.\n\nH=2, reach at t1+1 with y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at t1 with y=9, but impossible.\n\nSo H=2 is minimal.\n\nAnd in this case, it works.\n\nBut why is the initial turn 99? Maybe to see if the cars are moving and at some point 0 is covered.\n\nFor example, on y=8, car moving right, span [1+3k, 12+3k] for k=0,1,2,... since speed 3.\n\nAt turn t1, k=0, [1,12]\n\nt1+1, [4,15]\n\nt1+2, [7,18], etc., all min >0, so 0 never in span, so y=8 is always safe for this car, since it starts at 1 and moves right.\n\nSimilarly, other cars might be different.\n\nBut in this case, no problem.\n\nFor example, on y=7, there are cars, but I don't go there.\n\nFreeway 7: (16, 5, right, 4), and (-32, -43, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: (16,5, right,4), h=16, τ=5? For right-moving, span [τ, h] = [5,16]? τ=5, h=16, so min=5, max=16.\n\n[5,16]\n\nSecond car: (-32, -43, right,4), h=-32, τ=-43, so span [τ, h] = [-43, -32]\n\n0 not in either.\n\nBut moving right, speed 4.\n\nAt other times, but I not on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, y=6: (-42,-53, right,6), span [ -53, -42], 0 not in.\n\ny=5: (48,83, left,36), left-moving, span [h,τ] = [48,83], moving left, so decreasing, but 48 to 83, both positive, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, y=4: same as y=5? Freeway 4: (48,83, left,36), same as y=5? No, y=4 and y=5 both have the same car? No, different freeways.\n\nFreeway 4: (48,83, left,36)\n\nFreeway 5: (48,83, left,36), same parameters, but different freeways, so different cars.\n\nBut both have span [48,83] at t1, moving left, so at T, [48 -36dt, 83-36dt], with dt=T-t1.\n\n0 not in since min 48-36dt, at dt=0,48>0, dt=1,12>0, dt=2,48-72=-24<0, but 83-72=11>0, so when min negative and max positive, 0 might be in.\n\nFor example, at some T, when 48-36dt <=0 and 83-36dt >=0.\n\n48-36dt <=0 => dt >= 48/36=4/3, so dt>=2 since integer.\n\n83-36dt >=0 for dt<=83/36≈2.305, so dt<=2.\n\nSo at dt=2, 48-72= -24, 83-72=11, so span [-24,11], which includes 0.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nBut I am not on y=4 or y=5, so irrelevant.\n\nBack to y=8, always safe.\n\nSo I think I can move immediately.\n\nBut the player is at y=8, and I need to reach y=9, so moving up is the way.\n\nPerhaps the issue is that at turn t1, if I move, but I think it's fine.\n\nAnother thing: the collision condition.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in Span(T) but not Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut in this case, when I move from y=8 to y=9 at turn T, at turn T I am on y=8, so I check y=8 cars at turn T.\n\nAt turn T+1, I am on y=9, no cars.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, I think with action at t1: U, I go to y=9 at t1+1.\n\nThen for the sequence, with H=2:\n\nTurn t1: U\n\nTurn t1+1: S (for example)\n\nBut since we reach at turn t1+1, and action at t1+1 is not necessary, but we have to specify.\n\nPerhaps I can set H=1, but impossible.\n\nOr maybe the minimal H is 1, but cannot.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I can be at y=9 at turn t1, but I start at y=8, so no.\n\nUnless I was there, but I'm not.\n\nSo I think H=2 is correct.\n\nBut let me see if there is a car at position 0 on some freeway at some time, but for y=8, no.\n\nFor example, on y=2, there is a car with (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 2: cars: (48, 37, right, 12), and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: (48,37, right,12), h=48, τ=37? For right-moving, span [τ, h] = [37,48], since τ=37, h=48, so [37,48]\n\nSecond car: (0, -11, right,12), h=0, τ=-11, span [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt t1, span [-11,0], and 0 is included, since [ -11, 0], 0 is the endpoint.\n\nSo at turn t1, on y=2, if I were there, I would collide because 0 in span.\n\nBut I am not on y=2.\n\nSimilarly, for the other car on y=2: [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nBut for the second car, at t1, span [-11,0], so 0 is included, so if on y=2 at t1, collision.\n\nBut I am on y=8.\n\nNow, this car is moving right, speed 12, so at t1+1, span [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nBut again, not relevant.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 same as y=2.\n\nFreeway 3: same cars as y=2: (48,37, right,12) and (0,-11,right,12), so same situation.\n\nBut I don't care.\n\nSo for me, on y=8 at t1, safe.\n\nTherefore, I can move up immediately.\n\nI think I should go with that.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nSo for H=2:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t1: U\n\nTurn t1+1: S (I can choose S to stay, or anything)\n\nSince y=9, staying is fine.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 99: U\nTurn 100: S\n}\n\nt1=99.\n\nAnd H=2.\n\nBut let me confirm if at turn t1+1, when I am on y=9, it is safe, which it is.\n\nAction at turn t1+1: S, then y_{t1+2}=9, but we don't care.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can have only one action, but I can't.\n\nAnother thought: is it possible to reach at turn t1 with y=9? No.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n\nBut I feel like maybe I missed something because other freeways have cars that cover 0 at some points, but since I don't go there, it should be ok.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, but as we saw, no.\n\nMaybe the car on y=8 at some other time, but at t1 it's fine.\n\nI think I should proceed.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 99\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nAt turn \\(t_1 = 99\\), the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The car on freeway 8 has state \\((12, 1, \\text{right}, 3)\\). For a right-moving car, the span at turn \\(T\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Span}(T) = [\\tau + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\\]\nAt \\(T = t_1 = 99\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Span}(99) = [1 + 3(0), 12 + 3(0)] = [1, 12]\n\\]\nSince \\(0 \\notin [1, 12]\\), there is no collision at turn 99 on \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe player can move up to \\(y = 9\\) by taking action \\(U\\) at turn 99. This sets \\(y_{100} = 8 + 1 = 9\\).\n\nAt turn 100, the player is on \\(y = 9\\). Since there are no cars on \\(y = 9\\) (as freeways are only from \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)), the position is safe, and the goal \\((0, 9)\\) is reached at turn 100.\n\nTo achieve this, \\(H = 2\\) turns are needed, as \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{99 + 2 - 1} = y_{100} = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions must include actions from turn \\(t_1\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 100\\). At turn 99, action \\(U\\) is taken to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 100. At turn 100, an action must be specified but does not affect the position at turn 100 (since \\(y_{100}\\) is already 9); action \\(S\\) (stay) is chosen for simplicity.\n\nThus, the minimal \\(H\\) is 2, with the action sequence:\n- Turn 99: \\(U\\)\n- Turn 100: \\(S\\)\n\nNo other freeways are visited, so cars on other freeways do not affect the path.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn 99: } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn 100: } S\n}",
