The available moves are:\n1. U (up): (3, 3) → (3, 4)\n2. D (down): (3, 3) → (3, 2) → but (3, 2) is an internal obstacle (wall), so invalid.\n3. L (left): (3, 3) → (2, 3)\n\nThus, the valid immediate actions are **U** or **L**.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n#### Option 1: Move U to (3, 4)\n- New head position: (3, 4)\n- Direction becomes U.\n- Next steps to reach food:\n  - From (3, 4), can move L to (2, 4), then L to (1, 4) to eat the food at (1, 4) on turn 2.\n  - Alternatively, could move R to (4, 4), but this doesn't lead directly to food.\n\n#### Option 2: Move L to (2, 3)\n- New head position: (2, 3)\n- Direction remains L.\n- Next steps to reach food:\n  - From (2, 3), can move U to (2, 4), then L to (1, 4) to eat the food at (1, 4) on turn 2.\n  - Alternatively, can move D to (2, 2), then L to (1, 2) to eat the food at (1, 2) on turn 2.\n\n### Comparing Paths:\n- Both options (U or L) allow reaching (1, 4) in 2 turns.\n- Moving L first allows an additional path to (1, 2) in 2 turns, which is more flexible.\n- The food at (6, 6) is too far to consider immediately.\n\n### Risks:\n- After eating, the snake will grow to length 2, but since the initial length is 1, there is no risk of body collision yet.\n- The tail reward danger is not applicable here since the snake is length 1 (no tail yet).\n\n### Decision:\nMoving **L (left)** to (2, 3) is the better immediate action because:\n1. It allows reaching either (1, 4) or (1, 2) in the next steps, providing more flexibility.\n2. It doesn't restrict future movements more than moving U would.\n3. It keeps the snake away from the internal obstacle at (3, 2).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{L}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 0 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(3, 2)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(3, 3)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: L\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (1, 4, 10, 1)\n\t- (1, 2, 10, 1)\n\t- (6, 6, 10, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 0 \\)\n> <think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. The current turn is t_1 = 0. I need to think at least 5 turns ahead to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> Let me understand the grid. The walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (3,2). So I can't move into that cell.\n> \n> Snake positions: only one segment, which is the head at (3,3). That means the snake is length 1 right now. Head direction is L, which is left, so it's facing west.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,4) with value 1 and life_span 10\n> \n> - (1,2) with value 1 and life_span 10\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1 and life_span 10\n> \n> All food is positive, value +1, so eating any will increase length by 1. Life span is 10 for each, meaning they disappear after 10 turns if not eaten, including the current turn, so countdown decreases each turn.\n> \n> Since the snake is only one segment, there's no body to worry about yet. Also, no tail collision issues because the tail is the head itself, but since it's moving, it might grow when it eats.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,3), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: I can go U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But since current direction is L, I cannot do an instant reverse, which would be R (right). So I can't go right on this turn because that's opposite to left.\n> \n> So available moves: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid coordinates. Assuming (0,0) is bottom-left, but in the wall description, y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y increases upwards? Typically in such grids, y=0 might be bottom, but let's confirm.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive? Let's see: if x=0 is wall, x=7 is wall, so x coordinates from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Similarly, y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> But snake is at (3,3), which should be within bounds.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Food at (1,4), (1,2), (6,6).\n> \n> (1,2) is at x=1, y=2.

No, obstacle is at (3,2), which is a wall cell? No, walls are borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle (3,2).\n> \n> So (3,2) is occupied by a wall, so I cannot move there.\n> \n> D to (3,2) is invalid because it's a wall.\n> \n> Similarly, L to (2,3) should be fine.\n> \n> R to (4,3) but I can't go R because it's reverse direction.\n> \n> U to (3,4) should be fine.\n> \n> So available moves: U or L. D is blocked by wall.\n> \n> D to (3,2) is wall, so not possible.\n> \n> So only U and L are possible? What about staying? No, I have to move one cell per turn.\n> \n> Directions: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But D is invalid, R is invalid (reverse), so only U and L are possible actions.\n> \n> U: (3,4)\n> \n> L: (2,3)\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food.\n> \n> Food at (1,4), (1,2), (6,6)\n> \n> (1,4) is at x=1,y=4\n> \n> (1,2) at x=1,y=2\n> \n> (6,6) at x=6,y=6\n> \n> From (3,3), going U to (3,4) gets me closer to (1,4)? (3,4) to (1,4) is left, but (1,4) is at x=1.\n> \n> Similarly, going L to (2,3) gets me closer to (1,2) or (1,4)? (2,3) to (1,4) is not direct, or to (1,2).\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of moves to eat food while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Since snake is length 1, no body collision risk yet. But after eating, it will grow.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills. But now, no tail, so not an issue.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food life spans. All have life span 10, and current turn 0, so they disappear after turn 10? Life span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it disappears after L turns from now? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for a food spawned at turn S with life_span L, it will disappear at turn S + L - 1? Or S + L?\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, countdown is C. After turn t, C decreases by 1. When C=0, it disappears? Or at the start of turn?\n> \n> The state is given at turn t_1=0, so at turn 0, life span is 10, meaning after 10 turns, it will be gone.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn 0, life span is 10. After turn 0, countdown becomes 9. After turn 1, 8, and so on. When countdown reaches 0, after that turn, it disappears? Or at the end of the turn?\n> \n> The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", so if N=10, it disappears after 10 turns, meaning it is present from turn 0 to turn 9, and gone at turn 10.\n> \n> Countdown at turn t: for food, at turn 0, life_span=10, so countdown=10. After each turn, it decreases. When countdown=1, after that turn it becomes 0 and disappears? Let's think.\n> \n> Typically, \"disappears after N turns\" might mean it is available for N turns including the current one or not.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, let's look at the countdown: \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> At turn t_1=0, for a food, life_span=10, so countdown=10.\n> \n> After turn 0 is executed, countdown decreases to 9, and so on. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears, probably after the turn where countdown was 1.\n> \n> But for planning, since all food has life_span 10, and we're at turn 0, we have 10 turns to eat them before they disappear. But we might not need that long.\n> \n> Now, back to moves.\n> \n> From (3,3), I can go U to (3,4) or L to (2,3).\n> \n> If I go U to (3,4), I'm at (3,4). Then from there, I can go U, D, L, R, but not reverse if I just moved U, but since direction was L, after moving U, new direction is U, so I cannot go D next, etc. But let's not get ahead.\n> \n> If I go L to (2,3), I'm at (2,3), direction L.\n> \n> Now, food at (1,4) and (1,2) are both at x=1, so left side.\n> \n> (1,4) is y=4, (1,2) is y=2.\n> \n> From (2,3), I could go U to (2,4) or D to (2,2) or L to (1,3) or R to (3,3), but R might be reverse if I came from left? Let's keep track of direction.\n> \n> Current position and direction: at (3,3) dir L.\n> \n> Action turn 0: say U, to (3,4), new dir U.\n> \n> Then turn 1: from (3,4) dir U, can go U to (3,5), D to (3,3) but D is reverse, not allowed, L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n> \n> Similarly, if action turn 0 L, to (2,3) dir L.\n> \n> Then turn 1: from (2,3) dir L, can go U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3) but R is reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> Now, let's think about getting to food.\n> \n> First, food at (1,4): from current (3,3), one way is to go U to (3,4), then L to (2,4), then L to (1,4). So two moves to eat it, at turn 2 if I start now.\n> \n> Turn 0: U to (3,4)\n> \n> Turn 1: L to (2,4)\n> \n> Turn 2: L to (1,4) — eat food, snake grows to length 2, head at (1,4), tail at (3,4)? Positions: after eating, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added, so body becomes previous positions.\n> \n> Start: snake at [(3,3)]\n> \n> Turn 0: move U to (3,4), no food, so snake becomes [(3,4)] — still length 1.\n> \n> Then turn 1: move L to (2,4), no food, snake [(2,4)]\n> \n> Turn 2: move L to (1,4), which is food, so eat it, snake grows: head to (1,4), and body is previous, so positions: [(1,4), (2,4)] — length 2.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go directly to (1,4) via left, but from (3,3) I can't go directly L to (2,3) then to (1,4) not directly.\n> \n> From (3,3) go L to (2,3), then turn 1 U to (2,4), then L to (1,4) on turn 2, same as above.\n> \n> (2,3) to (1,4) is not adjacent, so need to go to (2,4) or (1,3) first.\n> \n> (1,4) is at (1,4), adjacent cells are (1,5), (1,3), (0,4), (2,4). But x=0 is wall, so (0,4) invalid, (2,4) is valid.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) at (1,2), adjacent (1,3), (1,1), (0,2), (2,2). (0,2) invalid.\n> \n> Now, another food at (1,2). To reach (1,2) from (3,3): one way, go L to (2,3), then D to (2,2), then L to (1,2).\n> \n> Turn 0: L to (2,3)\n> \n> Turn 1: D to (2,2) — but (2,2) is not food, unless it is, but food is at (1,2), not (2,2).\n> \n> Then turn 2: L to (1,2) eat.\n> \n> From (2,3), go L to (1,3), then D to (1,2) or U to (1,4), etc.\n> \n> But (1,3) has no food.\n> \n> Now, food at (6,6) is far away, at the opposite corner.\n> \n> I need to think about which food to target first, considering the path and risks.\n> \n> Since the snake is short, risks are low, but I should avoid dead ends or traps.\n> \n> Also, after eating, the body grows, so I need to move without colliding into myself.\n> \n> For example, if I go to (1,4) first, I end up near the wall at x=1, which might be risky if I grow longer.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) is near y=1, bottom wall.\n> \n> (6,6) is corner.\n> \n> But all are corners except (1,4) and (1,2) are not corners, but near walls.\n> \n> x=1 is wall, so (1,4) is adjacent to wall.\n> \n> Now, let's list all possible actions for turn 0: U or L.\n> \n> Case 1: Move U to (3,4)\n> \n> Then snake at (3,4), dir U.\n> \n> Now from here, I can go U to (3,5), L to (2,4), R to (4,4).

        "thinking": "Based on the detailed analysis and the guidance from the previous thinking model, the immediate action for the current turn \\( t_0 = 1 \\) (given the snake's head direction is L and the snake is at [(2, 3)]) is to move **Left (L)** to (1, 3). This aligns with the plan to eventually reach and eat the positive food at (1, 4) by turn 2. \n\nHere’s the reasoning for the immediate action at \\( t_0 = 1 \\):\n1. **Current State**: Snake at [(2, 3)], head direction L.  \n2. **Valid Moves**: Cannot reverse (R is invalid). D to (2, 2) is blocked by the internal obstacle (3, 2). Thus, only U (to (2, 4)) or L (to (1, 3)) are valid.  \n3. **Plan Alignment**: The previous plan (from \\( t_1 = 0 \\)) was to move L to (2, 3) at \\( t_0 = 0 \\), then U to (2, 4) at \\( t_0 = 1 \\), followed by L to (1, 4) to eat the food at turn 2. However, since the snake is already at (2, 3) at \\( t_0 = 1 \\), moving L to (1, 3) is safer (avoids potential future collisions) and still allows reaching (1, 4) via (1, 3) → (1, 4) next.  \n\n### Immediate Action:\n\\boxed{L}  \n\n### Additional Context:\n- Moving L to (1, 3) at \\( t_0 = 1 \\) ensures the snake is positioned to eat (1, 4) on the next turn (\\( t_0 = 2 \\)) by moving U to (1, 4).  \n- This avoids the risk of colliding with the body segment if the snake grows after eating (1, 4).  \n- The alternative (U to (2, 4)) would require an extra turn to reach (1, 4) and could complicate future movements.  \n\nThe action sequence continues as planned:  \n- \\( t_0 = 1 \\): L to (1, 3)  \n- \\( t_0 = 2 \\): U to (1, 4) (eat food)  \n- Follow the remaining plan to (6, 6).  \n\nThis ensures optimal score while minimizing risk.",

The current turn is t_1 = 0. I need to think at least 5 turns ahead to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> Let me understand the grid. The walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (3,2). So I can't move into that cell.\n> \n> Snake positions: only one segment, which is the head at (3,3). That means the snake is length 1 right now.

Life span is 10 for each, meaning they disappear after 10 turns if not eaten, including the current turn, so countdown decreases each turn.\n> \n> Since the snake is only one segment, there's no body to worry about yet. Also, no tail collision issues because the tail is the head itself, but since it's moving, it might grow when it eats.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,3), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: I can go U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).

But now, no tail, so not an issue.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food life spans. All have life span 10, and current turn 0, so they disappear after turn 10? Life span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it disappears after L turns from now? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for a food spawned at turn S with life_span L, it will disappear at turn S + L - 1?

After turn 0, countdown becomes 9. After turn 1, 8, and so on. When countdown reaches 0, after that turn, it disappears? Or at the end of the turn?\n> \n> The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", so if N=10, it disappears after 10 turns, meaning it is present from turn 0 to turn 9, and gone at turn 10.\n> \n> Countdown at turn t: for food, at turn 0, life_span=10, so countdown=10. After each turn, it decreases. When countdown=1, after that turn it becomes 0 and disappears? Let's think.\n> \n> Typically, \"disappears after N turns\" might mean it is available for N turns including the current one or not.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, let's look at the countdown: \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> At turn t_1=0, for a food, life_span=10, so countdown=10.\n> \n> After turn 0 is executed, countdown decreases to 9, and so on. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears, probably after the turn where countdown was 1.\n> \n> But for planning, since all food has life_span 10, and we're at turn 0, we have 10 turns to eat them before they disappear. But we might not need that long.\n> \n> Now, back to moves.\n> \n> From (3,3), I can go U to (3,4) or L to (2,3).\n> \n> If I go U to (3,4), I'm at (3,4).

D to (1,1), but y=1, walls y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is playable? y=0 is wall, y=1 is not wall, so (1,1) should be free, unless obstacle, but no, obstacle only at (3,2).\n> \n> So (1,1) free.\n> \n> But U to (1,3) is body, collision.\n> \n> So only possible moves: R to (2,2) or D to (1,1).\n> \n> Now, food left: only (6,6), which is far.\n> \n> But there might be more food later, but for now, only these three.\n> \n> The state has only these foods.\n> \n> After eating two foods, I have a snake of length 3, stuck near (1,2), and need to go to (6,6).\n> \n> But (6,6) is at top-right, I'm at bottom-left.\n> \n> Also, the internal obstacle at (3,2) might be in the way.\n> \n> For example, to go from (1,2) to (6,6), I need to move right and up.\n> \n> But from (1,2), if I go R to (2,2), then I can go U or R, etc.\n> \n> But (3,2) is obstacle, so I cannot go directly to (3,2), so I have to go around.\n> \n> For example, from (2,2), I can go to (2,3), then (2,4), etc., avoiding (3,2).\n> \n> But it might take many turns.\n> \n> Moreover, the food at (6,6) might disappear if I take too long, but life span 10, from turn 0, so I have until turn 10 to eat it, but after eating first food at turn 2, and second at turn 4, I have until turn 10 to eat the third.\n> \n> Turn 0: start\n> \n> If I eat first food at turn 2, second at turn 4, then at turn 4 I'm at (1,2), need to go to (6,6), which is at least 10 moves away? |1-6|=5, |2-6|=4, min 9 moves, but with obstacles, might be more.\n> \n> |1-6| x-diff 5, |2-6| y-diff 4, so Manhattan distance 9, so at least 9 moves from (1,2) to (6,6), so at turn 4 + 9 = turn 13, but food disappears after 10 turns from now, so at turn 10 it disappears? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> At turn t_1=0, life span 10, so disappears after 10 turns, meaning it is present until turn 9, gone at turn 10.\n> \n> Countdown at turn 0: 10, decreases each turn.\n> \n> After turn 0, countdown 9; after turn 1, 8; ... after turn 9, countdown 1? At turn t, before move, countdown is C.\n> \n> After the move, it decreases.\n> \n> But for disappearance: \"disappears after N turns\", so with N=10, it should be gone after turn 10, so available from turn 0 to turn 9 inclusive.\n> \n> At turn 10, it is gone.\n> \n> Similarly, if I want to eat at turn T, T must be <=9 for this food.\n> \n> Now, if I eat first food at turn 2, second at turn 4, then at turn 4, I need to reach (6,6) by turn 9.\n> \n> From (1,2) to (6,6), min distance 9, but I can reach in 9 moves only if direct path, but with the obstacle, it might take more.\n> \n> For example, from (1,2) to (2,2) to (2,3) to (2,4) to (3,4) to (4,4) to (5,4) to (5,5) to (5,6) to (6,6) — that's 8 moves: (1,2)->(2,2)->(2,3)->(2,4)->(3,4)->(4,4)->(5,4)->(5,5)->(6,6)? (5,5) to (6,6) is one move, but let's count cells:\n> \n> Start from (1,2)\n> \n> 1. to (2,2)\n> \n> 2. to (2,3)\n> \n> 3. to (2,4)\n> \n> 4. to (3,4)  // now at (3,4)\n> \n> 5. to (4,4)\n> \n> 6. to (5,4)\n> \n> 7. to (5,5)\n> \n> 8. to (5,6)  // (5,6)\n> \n> 9. to (6,6)\n> \n> 9 moves to (6,6) from (1,2).\n> \n> At turn 4 I'm at (1,2), so after move turn 4, at (1,2).\n> \n> Then moves turn 5 to (2,2), turn 6 to (2,3), turn 7 to (2,4), turn 8 to (3,4), turn 9 to (4,4), but (4,4) not (6,6), I need to get to (6,6) by turn 9.\n> \n> Turn 9 is the last chance to eat, since disappears after turn 10.\n> \n> At turn 9, I can be at (6,6) to eat.\n> \n> But from above, at turn 8 I'm at (3,4), then to (4,4) turn 9, not (6,6).\n> \n> Faster path?

Cannot move R (right) because it's opposite to current direction L.\n- **Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle at (3,2).\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,4): value +1 (up from head)\n  - (1,2): value +1 (down from head)\n  - (6,6), (6,5): distant food (not immediately relevant)\n\n### Move Evaluation:\n1. **Move L (left) to (0,3)**:\n   - (0,3) is a wall (x=0) → collision → death → invalid.\n\n2. **Move U (up) to (1,4)**:\n   - Eats food at (1,4): +1 score, length becomes 2.\n   - New head: (1,4), body: (1,3).\n   - Next possible moves: U (to (1,5)) or R (to (2,4)). Cannot move D (opposite) or L (wall).\n\n3. **Move D (down) to (1,2)**:\n   - Eats food at (1,2): +1 score, length becomes 2.\n   - New head: (1,2), body: (1,3).\n   - Next possible moves: D (to (1,1)) or R (to (2,2)). Cannot move U (opposite) or L (wall).\n\n### Long-Term Considerations:\n- **Obstacle at (3,2)**: Blocks lower paths. Moving down first may constrain future movement more than moving up.\n- **Path to Distant Food**: Moving up allows a clearer path to the right (e.g., (1,4) → (2,4) → (3,4)...). Moving down requires navigating around (3,2).\n- **Food Accessibility**: After moving up, the food at (1,2) is still accessible later (though harder to reach with a longer body). Similarly, after moving down, (1,4) is still accessible.\n\n### Decision:\nMoving **U (up)** is better because:\n1. It avoids the obstacle at (3,2) blocking future movement.\n2. It provides a clearer path to the distant food on the right.\n3. The food at (1,2) can still be eaten later if possible.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{U}",

It avoids immediate risks (no collisions or walls).\n2. It aligns with the long-term plan to reach `(6,5)` and `(6,6)`, which are high-value targets with longer lifespans.\n3.

It's turn 6, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are on the borders, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So any cell with x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is a wall. Playable cells are from (1,1) to (6,6). Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,4), body at (3,4). So the snake has two segments: head and one body part. Since it's moving right, from (3,4) to (4,4), so direction is R.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,2) with value 1, life span 4. Since it's turn 6, life span decreases each turn, including current. So at turn 6, it has 4 turns left, meaning it disappears after turn 9? Life span decreases every turn, so if life span is N at turn t, it disappears at turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The food has a life span: it disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including the current turn. So for food at turn t with life span L:\n> \n> - At turn t, life span = L\n> \n> - After turn t, life span becomes L-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - When life span reaches 0, it disappears after that turn? Or at the start of the turn?\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"Disappears after N turns\". I think \"after N turns\" means after N turns from now, it's gone. But countdown decreases including current turn, so:\n> \n> - Turn t: life span = L, so it will disappear after L more turns? Example: if at turn t, life span is 4, then:\n> \n> - Turn t: countdown = 4\n> \n> - Turn t+1: countdown = 3\n> \n> - Turn t+2: countdown = 2\n> \n> - Turn t+3: countdown = 1\n> \n> - Turn t+4: countdown = 0, disappears? Or after turn t+4?\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the start of each turn, the life span decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, the food is removed before or after the turn? But it says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning it exists for N turns including the current one or not?\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, for food with life span N at turn t, it will be present for N more turns? Countdown decreases at each turn, so at turn t, countdown = N, at turn t+1, countdown = N-1, ..., at turn t + N - 1, countdown = 1, then at turn t + N, it disappears.\n> \n> But \"disappears after N turns\" might mean that it is present during turns t to t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> Similarly, \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – at turn t, when we see it, countdown is N, which decreases each turn.\n> \n> For this state, turn t=6:\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,2): value 1, life span 4. So at turn 6, life span=4, so it will disappear after turn 9? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 6: life span=4\n> \n> - Turn 7: life span=3\n> \n> - Turn 8: life span=2\n> \n> - Turn 9: life span=1\n> \n> - Turn 10: life span=0, disappears. But when does it disappear? Probably at the end of turn 9 or start of turn 10? I think for eating, as long as it's present during a turn, it can be eaten that turn.\n> \n> The rule doesn't specify, but I think we assume that at the start of turn, food is present if life span >0, and after the snake moves, if head is on food, it eats it.\n> \n> Similarly, life span decreases at the end of the turn or something. To simplify, since we're planning for future turns, we need to know when food exists.\n> \n> For this food at (1,2): life span 4 at turn 6, so:\n> \n> - Exists on turns 6,7,8,9 (since countdown from 4 to 1)\n> \n> - After turn 9, countdown=0, disappears before turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, other food:\n> \n> - (6,6): value 1, life span 4, same as above, exists turns 6-9\n> \n> - (6,5): value 1, life span 5, so at turn 6, life span=5, exists turns 6-10\n> \n> - (1,6): value 1, life span 8, exists turns 6-13\n> \n> All food have value 1, positive food, since value=1.\n> \n> No negative food mentioned, all are +1.\n> \n> Now, snake: positions [(4,4), (3,4)], head at (4,4), moving right, so from (3,4) to (4,4), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is R, so cannot move L (left) on this turn. So possible moves: U, D, R. (since L is opposite, not allowed).\n> \n> No instant reverse: so from current direction R, cannot go L immediately.\n> \n> Now, grid: walls at borders, so x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls. Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), so (3,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake head at (4,4), body at (3,4).\n> \n> Food at: (1,2), (6,6), (6,5), (1,6)\n> \n> I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, but since it's a sequence, I should plan for multiple turns.\n> \n> The answer should have an action sequence starting from turn 6, then turn 7, etc., and I need to think 5+ turns ahead for strategy.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid for clarity.\n> \n> Grid size: 6x6 playable, but coordinates (1,1) to (6,6), with walls outside.\n> \n> Let me sketch:\n> \n> y=6: row 6\n> \n> ...\n> \n> y=1: row 1\n> \n> x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> So, positions:\n> \n> - (1,2): food, life span 4\n> \n> - (6,6): food, life span 4\n> \n> - (6,5): food, life span 5\n> \n> - (1,6): food, life span 8\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2)\n> \n> Snake: head (4,4), body (3,4), so tail is at (3,4)\n> \n> Since only two segments, when it moves, if it eats food, it grows, so tail doesn't move immediately? Standard snake: when snake moves to a new cell, if no food, tail moves forward, so head moves to new position, tail is removed. If food, head moves to food, tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, body segments: after head moves, the body follows.\n> \n> Current state, snake positions list: head first, then body. So after head, the next segment is the one behind.\n> \n> When snake moves in a direction, head goes to new position. If the new position has food, it eats it, and the tail remains, so snake grows by one. If no food, tail is removed, so snake length same.\n> \n> Here, all food are positive, so eating increases length by one.\n> \n> Also, collision: if head hits body or wall, death. But can move to tail position only if tail moves away, but in this case, since snake is short, it might be possible.\n> \n> Now, for turn 6, possible actions: U (up, to (4,5)), D (down, to (4,3)), R (right, to (5,4)), cannot L because opposite to current R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about getting food while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's see where the food is and life spans.\n> \n> Food at (1,2): life span 4, so must be eaten by turn 9 or it disappears. Turn 10 it disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 9.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) life span 4, last chance turn 9.\n> \n> (6,5) life span 5, last chance turn 10.\n> \n> (1,6) life span 8, plenty of time.\n> \n> Also, (6,5) and (6,6) are both near each other, at (6,5) and (6,6).\n> \n> (6,5) is below (6,6)? y-coordinates: assuming y increases up or down? The movement: U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, I think, so higher y is up.\n> \n> In the movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n> \n> So, y increases as we go up, so (x,y) with y=0 at bottom? Walls: y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But walls are at y=0 and y=7, so playable y from 1 to 6, with y=1 bottom, y=6 top? Let's see.\n> \n> Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls. So for a cell, y=0 is bottom row, y=7 is top row? But since walls, the playable cells are y from 1 to 6, where y=1 is the bottom row, y=6 is the top row? Movement U: (x,y+1), so if at (x,1), U to (x,2), which is up, so y increases upward. So y=1 bottom, y=6 top.\n> \n> Similarly, x: x=1 left, x=6 right.\n> \n> So grid:\n> \n> Top row y=6: (1,6) to (6,6)\n> \n> Bottom row y=1: (1,1) to (6,1)\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,2): at x=1,y=2, which is left side, second row from bottom.\n> \n> - (6,6): x=6,y=6, top-right corner\n> \n> - (6,5): x=6,y=5, which is below (6,6), so one row down from top.\n> \n> - (1,6): x=1,y=6, top-left corner\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2): x=3,y=2, which is on the same row as (1,2), but x=3.\n> \n> Snake at (4,4) and (3,4), so at x=4,y=4 and x=3,y=4, which is center-left.\n> \n> Head at (4,4), moving right.\n> \n> Now, to maximize score, I need to eat as much food as possible, but with long-term survival.\n> \n> Since all food is positive and same value, I should prioritize food that is about to disappear soon, but also consider distance.\n> \n> First, food with short life span: (1,2) and (6,6) both life span 4, so must be eaten by turn 9.\n> \n> (6,5) life span 5, by turn 10.\n> \n> (1,6) life span 8, by turn 13.\n> \n> Turn 6 now, so (1,2) and (6,6) need to be eaten soon.\n> \n> But snake is at (4,4), so (1,2) is at (1,2), which is left-bottom, distance: |4-1|=3 in x, |4-2|=2 in y, so Manhattan distance 5.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) is at (6,6), |4-6|=2 in x, |4-6|=2 in y, distance 4.\n> \n> (6,5) at (6,5), |4-6|=2, |4-5|=1, distance 3.\n> \n> (1,6) at (1,6), |4-1|=3, |4-6|=2, distance 5.\n> \n> So (6,5) is closest, distance 3.\n> \n> But (6,5) has longer life span, life span 5, so I can go for it later.\n> \n> (6,6) is distance 4, life span 4, so if I don't go soon, I might miss it.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) distance 5, life span 4.\n> \n> Also, (1,2) has an obstacle at (3,2), which is on the way if I go directly.\n> \n> (3,2) is an obstacle, so I cannot go through it.\n> \n> Now, for turn 6, possible moves from (4,4):\n> \n> - U to (4,5)\n> \n> - D to (4,3)\n> \n> - R to (5,4)\n> \n> Cannot L.\n> \n> Now, let's see what each move leads to.\n> \n> First, if I go R to (5,4): that's toward (6,5) and (6,6).

This maximizes score by targeting the most urgent food (life span 3 and 4).\n\n### Current Turn \\( t_0 = 7 \\):\n- The snake is at (5, 4), having just moved right from (4,4) at turn 6.\n- The next step in the plan is to move right again to (6,4).\n\n### Decision for Turn \\( t_0 = 7 \\):\n- Follow the plan: move **Right (R)** to (6,4).

It's turn 6, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are on the borders, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So any cell with x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is a wall. Playable cells are from (1,1) to (6,6). Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,4), body at (3,4). So the snake has two segments: head and one body part. Since it's moving right, from (3,4) to (4,4), so direction is R.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,2) with value 1, life span 4. Since it's turn 6, life span decreases each turn, including current. So at turn 6, it has 4 turns left, meaning it disappears after turn 9? Life span decreases every turn, so if life span is N at turn t, it disappears at turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The food has a life span: it disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including the current turn. So for food at turn t with life span L:\n> \n> - At turn t, life span = L\n> \n> - After turn t, life span becomes L-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - When life span reaches 0, it disappears after that turn? Or at the start of the turn?\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"Disappears after N turns\". I think \"after N turns\" means after N turns from now, it's gone. But countdown decreases including current turn, so:\n> \n> - Turn t: life span = L, so it will disappear after L more turns? Example: if at turn t, life span is 4, then:\n> \n> - Turn t: countdown = 4\n> \n> - Turn t+1: countdown = 3\n> \n> - Turn t+2: countdown = 2\n> \n> - Turn t+3: countdown = 1\n> \n> - Turn t+4: countdown = 0, disappears? Or after turn t+4?\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the start of each turn, the life span decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, the food is removed before or after the turn? But it says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning it exists for N turns including the current one or not?\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, for food with life span N at turn t, it will be present for N more turns? Countdown decreases at each turn, so at turn t, countdown = N, at turn t+1, countdown = N-1, ..., at turn t + N - 1, countdown = 1, then at turn t + N, it disappears.\n> \n> But \"disappears after N turns\" might mean that it is present during turns t to t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> Similarly, \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – at turn t, when we see it, countdown is N, which decreases each turn.\n> \n> For this state, turn t=6:\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,2): value 1, life span 4. So at turn 6, life span=4, so it will disappear after turn 9? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 6: life span=4\n> \n> - Turn 7: life span=3\n> \n> - Turn 8: life span=2\n> \n> - Turn 9: life span=1\n> \n> - Turn 10: life span=0, disappears. But when does it disappear? Probably at the end of turn 9 or start of turn 10? I think for eating, as long as it's present during a turn, it can be eaten that turn.\n> \n> The rule doesn't specify, but I think we assume that at the start of turn, food is present if life span >0, and after the snake moves, if head is on food, it eats it.\n> \n> Similarly, life span decreases at the end of the turn or something. To simplify, since we're planning for future turns, we need to know when food exists.\n> \n> For this food at (1,2): life span 4 at turn 6, so:\n> \n> - Exists on turns 6,7,8,9 (since countdown from 4 to 1)\n> \n> - After turn 9, countdown=0, disappears before turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, other food:\n> \n> - (6,6): value 1, life span 4, same as above, exists turns 6-9\n> \n> - (6,5): value 1, life span 5, so at turn 6, life span=5, exists turns 6-10\n> \n> - (1,6): value 1, life span 8, exists turns 6-13\n> \n> All food have value 1, positive food, since value=1.\n> \n> No negative food mentioned, all are +1.\n> \n> Now, snake: positions [(4,4), (3,4)], head at (4,4), moving right, so from (3,4) to (4,4), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is R, so cannot move L (left) on this turn. So possible moves: U, D, R.

Standard snake: when snake moves to a new cell, if no food, tail moves forward, so head moves to new position, tail is removed. If food, head moves to food, tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, body segments: after head moves, the body follows.\n> \n> Current state, snake positions list: head first, then body. So after head, the next segment is the one behind.\n> \n> When snake moves in a direction, head goes to new position. If the new position has food, it eats it, and the tail remains, so snake grows by one. If no food, tail is removed, so snake length same.\n> \n> Here, all food are positive, so eating increases length by one.\n> \n> Also, collision: if head hits body or wall, death. But can move to tail position only if tail moves away, but in this case, since snake is short, it might be possible.\n> \n> Now, for turn 6, possible actions: U (up, to (4,5)), D (down, to (4,3)), R (right, to (5,4)), cannot L because opposite to current R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about getting food while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's see where the food is and life spans.\n> \n> Food at (1,2): life span 4, so must be eaten by turn 9 or it disappears. Turn 10 it disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 9.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) life span 4, last chance turn 9.\n> \n> (6,5) life span 5, last chance turn 10.\n> \n> (1,6) life span 8, plenty of time.\n> \n> Also, (6,5) and (6,6) are both near each other, at (6,5) and (6,6).\n> \n> (6,5) is below (6,6)? y-coordinates: assuming y increases up or down?

Walls: y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But walls are at y=0 and y=7, so playable y from 1 to 6, with y=1 bottom, y=6 top? Let's see.\n> \n> Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls. So for a cell, y=0 is bottom row, y=7 is top row? But since walls, the playable cells are y from 1 to 6, where y=1 is the bottom row, y=6 is the top row? Movement U: (x,y+1), so if at (x,1), U to (x,2), which is up, so y increases upward.

Moving Down (D) to (6,3) would:\n   - Avoid food, keeping snake length short\n   - Make it impossible to reach (6,5) and (6,6) before they disappear\n   - Lead away from most food sources\n\n**Decision:**\nThe optimal immediate action is to move Up (U) to eat the food at (6,5), as this:\n- Gains immediate points\n- Positions the snake to potentially eat another food (6,6) next turn\n- Is safe (no collision risk)\n- Doesn't violate movement rules (current direction is R, so U is allowed)\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Eating it would grow the snake to length 4.\n  - Check for Tail Reward Danger: Tail is at (5, 4). Head is at (6, 5). They are not adjacent (Manhattan distance > 1), so no danger.\n  - Valid move.\n- **L (Left)**: Move to (5, 5).\n  - No food at (5, 5). No collision risk.\n  - Valid move.\n- **R (Right)**: Move to (7, 5).\n  - x=7 is a wall. Invalid move (deadly).\n\n### Decision:\n- **Priority**: Eat the food at (6, 6) because it disappears after this turn. Missing it would lose the opportunity to gain points and grow the snake.\n- **Safety**: Moving U to (6, 6) is safe (no collisions, no Tail Reward Danger).\n- **Alternative**: Moving L to (5, 5) is safe but misses the food.\n\n### Action:\n\\boxed{U} \n\n### Reasoning:\nAt Turn 9, the snake should move **U (up)** to (6, 6) to eat the positive food there before it disappears. This maximizes the score and grows the snake safely, as no immediate risks (collisions or Tail Reward Danger) are present. The alternative (moving left) is safe but suboptimal since it misses the food.",

It's turn 10, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, because x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly for y. So playable cells are (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (3,2)\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,6), then (6,5), (6,4), (5,4). So the snake has 4 segments. Head direction is Up, which is consistent with moving from (6,5) to (6,6) since y increases going up. From (6,5) to (6,6) is up, yes.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1 and life span 5. Since current turn is 10, it will disappear at turn 10 + 5 = 15? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 10, life span is 5, meaning it has 5 turns left, including turn 10. So after 5 turns, it disappears. So it will be gone after turn 14? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear after L-1 more turns? Example: if at turn t, life span is L, then:\n> \n> - At turn t: countdown L\n> \n> - Turn t+1: countdown L-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t + L-1: countdown 1\n> \n> - Turn t + L: gone\n> \n> So for (1,6): life span 5 at turn 10, so it will be present on turns 10,11,12,13,14? Countdown: turn 10: 5, turn 11:4, turn 12:3, turn 13:2, turn 14:1, then turn 15 it disappears. But it can be eaten until turn 14 inclusive? Since on turn 14, countdown is 1, so it's still there, and if eaten, it's consumed before disappearing.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> (1,6,5,1) — I think this means position (1,6), value 1, life span 5\n> \n> Food format: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\n> \n> So (1,6) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> (4,4) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> (4,2) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All positive food, since value 1, and no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.

Since head direction is Up, reverse would be Down. So I cannot move Down on the next turn because it would be opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Current head direction is Up, meaning the snake is facing Up, so instant reverse is not allowed. So from (6,6), with direction Up, I can move U (up), L (left), or R (right), but not D (down), because that would be reverse.\n> \n> Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> So current direction is U, so cannot move D next.\n> \n> Possible actions at turn 10: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, let's see the positions:\n> \n> - Up: (6,6) to (6,7) — but y=7 is wall, so collision, deadly.

Snake positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)]\n> \n> So (6,5) is the second segment, so if I move Down to (6,5), it's a body collision, since it's not the tail. Tail is (5,4), which is moving away.\n> \n> But moving to (6,5) would be collision with body, deadly.\n> \n> Moreover, I cannot move Down because of reverse rule.\n> \n> So only possible move at turn 10 is Left to (5,6).\n> \n> Is (5,6) safe? Let's see: after moving, the snake will be: head at (5,6), then the body: since head moves to (5,6), the tail moves? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and if no food eaten, tail is removed.\n> \n> But in this case, I'm not eating food, I think.\n> \n> (5,6) is not a food position, I think.

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state of the game at Turn \\( t_0 = 11 \\):\n\n- **Grid Dimensions**: 8x8 grid (coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n- **Walls**:\n  - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n  - Internal Obstacle: (3,2).\n- **Snake**:\n  - Positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)] (head at (5,6), tail at (6,4)).\n  - Current Direction: Left (L).\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,6): value=+1, life_span=4.\n  - (4,4): value=+1, life_span=6.\n  - (4,2): value=+1, life_span=9.\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 11\n\nFrom the current head position (5,6) and direction L, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (5,6) → (5,7). But y=7 is a wall. **Invalid**.\n2. **Down (D)**: (5,6) → (5,5). Check:\n   - Not a wall.\n   - Not occupied by the snake's body (body is at (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)).\n   - No food at (5,5). **Valid**.\n3. **Left (L)**: (5,6) → (4,6). Check:\n   - Not a wall.\n   - Not occupied by the snake's body.\n   - No food at (4,6). **Valid**.\n4. **Right (R)**: Opposite to current direction L. **Invalid**.\n\nSo, valid immediate actions: D or L.\n\n### Evaluating the Moves\n\n**Option 1: Move Down (D) to (5,5)**\n\n- **Immediate Effect**:\n  - New head: (5,5).\n  - Body: [(5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)]. Tail (6,4) is removed.\n- **Future Considerations**:\n  - Food at (1,6) has life_span=4 (present until turn 14).\n    - To reach (1,6) from (5,5):\n      - Need at least 4 moves (left 4, up 1 → min 4 moves).\n      - E.g., (5,5)→(4,5)→(3,5)→(2,5)→(1,5)→(1,6) → but (1,6) is gone by turn 15.\n    - Cannot reach (1,6) before it disappears.\n  - Other foods:\n    - (4,4): life_span=6 (until turn 16).\n      - From (5,5), can reach (4,4) in fewer moves, but need to plan path carefully.\n    - (4,2): life_span=9 (until turn 19).\n      - More time to reach.\n\n**Option 2: Move Left (L) to (4,6)**\n\n- **Immediate Effect**:\n  - New head: (4,6).\n  - Body: [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)]. Tail (6,4) is removed.\n- **Future Considerations**:\n  - Food at (1,6):\n    - Can reach in 3 moves: (4,6)→(3,6)→(2,6)→(1,6) at turn 14 (just before it disappears).\n    - Eating at (1,6) on turn 14:\n      - Snake grows: [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)].\n      - Then, from (1,6), possible moves:\n        - U: (1,7) wall → invalid.\n        - D: (1,5).\n        - L: (0,6) wall → invalid.\n        - R: (2,6) → body segment → collision.\n      - Only valid move: D to (1,5).\n  - Other foods:\n    - After eating (1,6), can plan to reach (4,4) or (4,2), but (4,4) disappears at turn 16, which may be hard to reach in time.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe primary goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. \n\n- **Food at (1,6)**:\n  - High priority due to short life_span (only until turn 14).\n  - Can be safely reached by moving left now (turn 11: L to (4,6)) and continuing left in subsequent turns.\n  - Missing it means losing a +1 score opportunity.\n- **Other Foods**:\n  - (4,4) and (4,2) have longer life_spans, so can be targeted after securing (1,6).\n\n**Risk Assessment**:\n- Moving left to (4,6) is safe (no immediate collision or wall).\n- Path to (1,6) is clear (no obstacles or body segments in the way).\n- After eating (1,6), the snake can move down to (1,5) to avoid getting stuck.\n\n**Alternative (Moving Down)**:\n- Cannot reach (1,6) in time.\n- May reach other foods, but missing (1,6) is a lost opportunity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe optimal immediate action is to move **Left (L)** to (4,6) to start the path towards eating the food at (1,6) before it disappears.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

It's turn 11, and the grid has walls and obstacles. The walls are the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). So the snake is moving left from (5,6) to (6,6)? Let's plot this.\n> \n> Head is at (5,6), and the direction is L, which is left. So from (5,6), moving left would be to (4,6), but the current position shows the head at (5,6) with direction L, meaning it just moved left to (5,6) or is about to move? I need to clarify.\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)]. Since head first, (5,6) is head, then (6,6) is the first body segment, (6,5) second, (6,4) tail. The head direction is L, which means in the previous move, it moved left to (5,6), I assume. But let's see the positions: from (6,6) to (5,6) would be moving left, but (6,6) is the first body segment, so the head was at (6,6) before moving left to (5,6).\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think of the current state: at turn 11, the snake has just moved to (5,6) from (6,6) by moving left, so head is now at (5,6) with direction L. The body segments are at (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). (6,5) and (6,4) are below (6,6), so the snake was moving down or something earlier.\n> \n> Let's trace the snake: positions: head (5,6), then (6,6) which is right of head, but since head moved left, (6,6) is where head was. Then (6,5) is below (6,6), and (6,4) below that. So the snake was at turn 10: head at (6,6), then it moved left to (5,6), so the body followed: (6,6) became body, and the tail was at (6,5), but after move, the new tail is (6,4)? No.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head goes to a new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> In this case, positions: before move, say turn 10: head at (6,6), body at (6,5), tail at (6,4). Then it moves left to (5,6), so new head is (5,6), body from head becomes (6,6), then (6,5) stays, but (6,4) is the tail, so after move, positions are: head (5,6), body (6,6), body (6,5), and tail (6,4). But (6,4) was tail, and since no food eaten, tail moves off? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: at each turn, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is vacated unless food is eaten and snake grows.\n> \n> Given positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)]\n> \n> This means at turn 11, head is (5,6), and the body segments are at (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). Since the head just moved to (5,6) from (6,6), and (6,6) is now the first body segment. Before that, the head was at (6,6) with some direction, but now direction is given as L, so it moved left.\n> \n> (6,5) and (6,4) are south of (6,6), so previously, the snake was moving down or south.\n> \n> But for current state, we have head at (5,6), direction L, so last move was left.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (4,4) with value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (4,2) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All are positive food since value 1, and life span decreases each turn, including current turn? Life span is how many turns left, I think.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 11, for food at (1,6), life span 4, so it will disappear after 4 more turns, meaning on turn 15 it will be gone? Let's see: life span N means it has N turns left including current, so after N turns it disappears.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So, for example, food with life span 4 at turn 11: it will disappear after turn 14? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means that at the start of turn t, if life span is N, then after N full turns, it disappears, but since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, with life span N, it will be there for this turn and N-1 more, so it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1 or something.\n> \n> To avoid confusion: countdown decreases every turn, including the current one. So at turn t, if life span is L, then after turn t, it becomes L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears. So it is present for turns when countdown >0.\n> \n> At turn 11, food (1,6) has life span 4, so it will be present for turns 11,12,13,14, and disappear at turn 15.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) life span 6: present turns 11 to 16, disappear turn 17.\n> \n> (4,2) life span 9: present turns 11 to 19, disappear turn 20.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so positive.\n> \n> Now, grid is 8x8 with walls at borders: so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake head at (5,6), with direction L (left), so it can move U (up), D (down), L (left), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> Current head direction is L, so it cannot move R (right) on this turn. Possible moves: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid to avoid collisions.\n> \n> First, current snake body: (5,6) head, (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). So body cells occupied: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). Head is at (5,6), which is not a body cell, so safe.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So for example, moving left from (5,6) to (4,6) would be within bounds since x=4 is not wall, y=6 not wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), which is not near head right now.\n> \n> Food locations: (1,6) at row 1, col 6? Coordinates: (x,y), so (1,6) is x=1,y=6.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) x=4,y=4, (4,2) x=4,y=2.\n> \n> Snake head at (5,6), so (1,6) is left, same row, distance |5-1|=4 in x, same y.\n> \n> (4,4) is down-left, x=4,y=4.\n> \n> (4,2) is further down, x=4,y=2.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's list possible moves from current position (5,6):\n> \n> - U (up): to (5,7). But y=7 is wall? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=7 is wall. Therefore, (5,7) is wall, cannot move there. So U is invalid.\n> \n> - D (down): to (5,5). Is this safe? (5,5) is not a wall, and let's see if it's occupied by body. Current body: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). (6,5) is at y=5,x=6, so (5,5) is empty. No food there, I think. Food at (1,6),(4,4),(4,2), not (5,5). So moving to (5,5) should be safe.\n> \n> - L (left): to (4,6). (4,6) is not wall, not body (body at (6,6) etc., all different), no food there? Food at (1,6) but (4,6) is empty. So safe.\n> \n> - R (right): but cannot, because opposite direction, current direction L, so R not allowed.\n> \n> So possible actions: D or L.\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Goal: eat food, but avoid risks, especially tail reward danger.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Current tail is at (6,4).\n> \n> Head is at (5,6), not adjacent to tail. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (5,6) and (6,4) are not adjacent; difference in x and y, so diagonal not adjacent. Adjacent only up, down, left, right.\n> \n> So no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, food to consider: (1,6) is close, at (1,6), same row, left. (4,4) is at (4,4), which is left and down. (4,2) is further.\n> \n> Life span: (1,6) has short life, only 4 turns including this one, so it will disappear soon if not eaten.\n> \n> (4,4) has 6 turns, (4,2) has 9, so more time.\n> \n> But I need to plan a sequence of moves.\n> \n> Since I have to provide an action sequence for several turns, but I don't know how many, but at least 5 turns ahead? The answer format says \"Action Sequence (in order)\" for turns t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, but since I need to think 5+ turns ahead, probably 5 turns or more.\n> \n> But the sequence might depend on what happens, but I think I need to output a fixed sequence based on current state, assuming no changes, but food life span decreases, and snake moves, but no new food spawns? The problem doesn't mention new food spawning, only existing food with life span.\n> \n> In this state, only these three food items, no new ones mentioned, so I assume only these exist.\n> \n> So I need to plan a path to eat some of them safely.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

But food at (1,6) has life span 4, which means at turn 11 it is present, after turn 11, life span 3, turn 12: 2, turn 13:1, turn 14:0? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> At turn 11, life span 4, so:\n> \n> - After turn 11, life span becomes 3\n> \n> - After turn 12, life span 2\n> \n> - After turn 13, life span 1\n> \n> - After turn 14, life span 0, so it disappears, meaning not available on turn 14? Let's read.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> And \"disappears after N turns\", but I think it means that at the beginning of each turn, if life span >0, it is present, and after the turn, life span decreases.\n> \n> So at start of turn t, food with life span L is present for that turn if L >0. After the turn, L decreases by 1.\n> \n> For (1,6) at turn 11: life span 4, so present on turns 11,12,13,14. On turn 15, it is gone.\n> \n> Similarly, to eat it, I need to be at (1,6) on or before turn 14.\n> \n> If I move to (1,6) on turn 14, I can eat it.\n> \n> Now, from current position (5,6) at turn 11.\n> \n> Move sequence to (1,6):\n> \n> Turn 11: L to (4,6)\n> \n> Turn 12: L to (3,6)\n> \n> Turn 13: L to (2,6)\n> \n> Turn 14: L to (1,6) and eat.\n> \n> But when I eat, snake grows, so length increases by 1.\n> \n> Currently snake length 4: positions 4 cells.\n> \n> After eating, it becomes 5.\n> \n> Now, is this path safe?

Since no food eaten, tail moves off, so new positions: head (4,6), body (5,6), (6,6), (6,5). Tail was (6,4), removed, so body now: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5). Length still 4.\n> \n> After move without eating: head new position, each body segment moves to previous position, tail cell vacated.\n> \n> So positions after turn 11 move to (4,6): head (4,6), then previous head (5,6) now body, then (6,6) now body, then (6,5) now tail.

Now, (1,6) has food, so eat it.

It's turn 11, and the grid has walls and obstacles. The walls are the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). So the snake is moving left from (5,6) to (6,6)? Let's plot this.\n> \n> Head is at (5,6), and the direction is L, which is left. So from (5,6), moving left would be to (4,6), but the current position shows the head at (5,6) with direction L, meaning it just moved left to (5,6) or is about to move? I need to clarify.\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)]. Since head first, (5,6) is head, then (6,6) is the first body segment, (6,5) second, (6,4) tail. The head direction is L, which means in the previous move, it moved left to (5,6), I assume. But let's see the positions: from (6,6) to (5,6) would be moving left, but (6,6) is the first body segment, so the head was at (6,6) before moving left to (5,6).\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think of the current state: at turn 11, the snake has just moved to (5,6) from (6,6) by moving left, so head is now at (5,6) with direction L. The body segments are at (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). (6,5) and (6,4) are below (6,6), so the snake was moving down or something earlier.\n> \n> Let's trace the snake: positions: head (5,6), then (6,6) which is right of head, but since head moved left, (6,6) is where head was. Then (6,5) is below (6,6), and (6,4) below that. So the snake was at turn 10: head at (6,6), then it moved left to (5,6), so the body followed: (6,6) became body, and the tail was at (6,5), but after move, the new tail is (6,4)? No.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head goes to a new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> In this case, positions: before move, say turn 10: head at (6,6), body at (6,5), tail at (6,4). Then it moves left to (5,6), so new head is (5,6), body from head becomes (6,6), then (6,5) stays, but (6,4) is the tail, so after move, positions are: head (5,6), body (6,6), body (6,5), and tail (6,4). But (6,4) was tail, and since no food eaten, tail moves off? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: at each turn, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is vacated unless food is eaten and snake grows.\n> \n> Given positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)]\n> \n> This means at turn 11, head is (5,6), and the body segments are at (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). Since the head just moved to (5,6) from (6,6), and (6,6) is now the first body segment. Before that, the head was at (6,6) with some direction, but now direction is given as L, so it moved left.\n> \n> (6,5) and (6,4) are south of (6,6), so previously, the snake was moving down or south.\n> \n> But for current state, we have head at (5,6), direction L, so last move was left.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (4,4) with value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (4,2) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All are positive food since value 1, and life span decreases each turn, including current turn? Life span is how many turns left, I think.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 11, for food at (1,6), life span 4, so it will disappear after 4 more turns, meaning on turn 15 it will be gone? Let's see: life span N means it has N turns left including current, so after N turns it disappears.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So, for example, food with life span 4 at turn 11: it will disappear after turn 14? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means that at the start of turn t, if life span is N, then after N full turns, it disappears, but since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, with life span N, it will be there for this turn and N-1 more, so it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1 or something.\n> \n> To avoid confusion: countdown decreases every turn, including the current one. So at turn t, if life span is L, then after turn t, it becomes L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears. So it is present for turns when countdown >0.\n> \n> At turn 11, food (1,6) has life span 4, so it will be present for turns 11,12,13,14, and disappear at turn 15.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) life span 6: present turns 11 to 16, disappear turn 17.\n> \n> (4,2) life span 9: present turns 11 to 19, disappear turn 20.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so positive.\n> \n> Now, grid is 8x8 with walls at borders: so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake head at (5,6), with direction L (left), so it can move U (up), D (down), L (left), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed.

Head is at (5,6), which is not a body cell, so safe.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So for example, moving left from (5,6) to (4,6) would be within bounds since x=4 is not wall, y=6 not wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), which is not near head right now.\n> \n> Food locations: (1,6) at row 1, col 6? Coordinates: (x,y), so (1,6) is x=1,y=6.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) x=4,y=4, (4,2) x=4,y=2.\n> \n> Snake head at (5,6), so (1,6) is left, same row, distance |5-1|=4 in x, same y.\n> \n> (4,4) is down-left, x=4,y=4.\n> \n> (4,2) is further down, x=4,y=2.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.

Therefore, (5,7) is wall, cannot move there. So U is invalid.\n> \n> - D (down): to (5,5). Is this safe? (5,5) is not a wall, and let's see if it's occupied by body. Current body: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). (6,5) is at y=5,x=6, so (5,5) is empty. No food there, I think. Food at (1,6),(4,4),(4,2), not (5,5). So moving to (5,5) should be safe.\n> \n> - L (left): to (4,6). (4,6) is not wall, not body (body at (6,6) etc., all different), no food there? Food at (1,6) but (4,6) is empty.

(4,2) is further.\n> \n> Life span: (1,6) has short life, only 4 turns including this one, so it will disappear soon if not eaten.\n> \n> (4,4) has 6 turns, (4,2) has 9, so more time.\n> \n> But I need to plan a sequence of moves.\n> \n> Since I have to provide an action sequence for several turns, but I don't know how many, but at least 5 turns ahead? The answer format says \"Action Sequence (in order)\" for turns t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, but since I need to think 5+ turns ahead, probably 5 turns or more.\n> \n> But the sequence might depend on what happens, but I think I need to output a fixed sequence based on current state, assuming no changes, but food life span decreases, and snake moves, but no new food spawns? The problem doesn't mention new food spawning, only existing food with life span.\n> \n> In this state, only these three food items, no new ones mentioned, so I assume only these exist.\n> \n> So I need to plan a path to eat some of them safely.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

Valid options: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L).\n- **Walls**: \n  - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n  - Internal Obstacle: (3,2) (irrelevant for current position).\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,6): Value +1, Life Span 2 (disappears after Turn 14).\n  - (4,4): Value +1, Life Span 4 (disappears after Turn 16).\n  - Others: Longer life spans (not urgent).\n\n### Immediate Moves:\n1. **Up (U) to (3,7)**:\n   - Invalid (y=7 is a wall).\n2. **Down (D) to (3,5)**:\n   - Valid (no wall or body collision).\n   - Moves away from food at (1,6), which expires soon.\n3. **Left (L) to (2,6)**:\n   - Valid (no wall or body collision).\n   - Moves toward food at (1,6), which can be eaten on Turn 14.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Option 1: Left (L) to (2,6)**:\n  - Turn 13: Move to (2,6). Snake becomes [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)].\n  - Turn 14: Move Left to (1,6) to eat food. Snake grows to [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)].\n  - Subsequent moves: Only Down (D) to (1,5) is safe (other directions blocked). This may corner the snake.\n- **Option 2: Down (D) to (3,5)**:\n  - Turn 13: Move to (3,5). Snake becomes [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)].\n  - Cannot reach (1,6) by Turn 14 (food expires). \n  - Focus shifts to other food (e.g., (4,4)), but it requires careful pathing around the obstacle at (3,2).\n\n### Decision:\n- The food at (1,6) is expiring soon (Turn 14), and it's safely reachable by moving Left now. While it may corner the snake temporarily, the +1 score is valuable, and future moves can be planned to escape the corner (e.g., moving Down to (1,5) afterward).\n\n### Action:\n\\boxed{L}",

It's turn 13, and the grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,2). The snake is at positions: head at (3,6), then (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). So the snake is horizontal, facing left, since head direction is L. The tail is at (6,6), and it's 4 segments long.\n> \n> Now, the food items:\n> \n> - (1,6) with life span 2, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (4,4) with life span 4, value +1\n> \n> - (4,2) with life span 7, value +1\n> \n> - (6,1) with life span 10, value +1\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. That's good; I don't have to worry about penalties.\n> \n> Life span decreases each turn, so I need to consider how long each food will last. For example, the food at (1,6) has life span 2, meaning it will disappear after 2 more turns, including this one. So if I don't eat it by turn 14, it's gone. Life span is given at turn t1=13, so:\n> \n> - Food at (1,6): life span 2, so it disappears after turn 14. That means it can be eaten on turn 13 or 14.\n> \n> - Food at (4,4): life span 4, disappears after turn 16.\n> \n> - Food at (4,2): life span 7, disappears after turn 19.\n> \n> - Food at (6,1): life span 10, disappears after turn 22.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (3,6), facing left. Current direction is L, so I can move U, D, or L, but not R because that would be instant reverse. Since it's facing left, opposite is right, so I cannot move right on the next turn.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,6):\n> \n> - Up: to (3,7) – but y=7 is a wall, so that's out of bounds. Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=7 is a wall, so moving up to (3,7) is invalid; it would cause a wall collision.\n> \n> - Down: to (3,5) – y=5 is within bounds, and no wall mentioned except borders, so should be ok.\n> \n> - Left: to (2,6) – x=2, y=6, should be within bounds.\n> \n> - Right: to (4,6) – but (4,6) is occupied by the snake's body. The snake positions are [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)], so (4,6) is the second segment. Moving right would cause a body collision immediately, since head would touch the body segment at (4,6). So that's deadly.\n> \n> Also, walls: borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), I assume, with walls on those lines.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), but that's not relevant for current position.\n> \n> So from (3,6), possible safe moves:\n> \n> - Down to (3,5)\n> \n> - Left to (2,6)\n> \n> Up is wall, right is body collision, so only down or left.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Food locations:\n> \n> - (1,6) is at row 6, column 1. Since snake is at row 6, and (1,6) is left, but at same y.\n> \n> - (4,4) is down-left from head.\n> \n> - (4,2) is down, but with obstacle at (3,2), so need to go around.\n> \n> - (6,1) is down-right.\n> \n> Also, the food at (1,6) has short life, only 2 turns left. If I want to eat it, I need to get to it by turn 14.\n> \n> Current position: (3,6)\n> \n> To reach (1,6): I can go left twice: turn 13: left to (2,6), then turn 14: left to (1,6). That should be possible.\n> \n> But let's check if it's safe.\n> \n> After moving left to (2,6) on turn 13, snake positions would be: head at (2,6), then body at (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). Tail is still at (6,6), but when I move, the tail moves? Let's see how snake moves.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail segment is removed unless I eat food.\n> \n> If I don't eat food, length remains same, tail moves.\n> \n> So after moving left to (2,6) on turn 13:\n> \n> - Head to (2,6)\n> \n> - Then body: (3,6) from old head, (4,6) from old second, (5,6) from old third. Old tail at (6,6) is gone, so positions: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)]\n> \n> Now, on turn 14, if I move left to (1,6), I eat the food there. Since it's positive, length increases by one.\n> \n> So after eating: head to (1,6), then body: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), and since I ate, a new segment is added, so tail is now at (5,6)? Let's clarify.\n> \n> When I eat food, the snake grows, so after moving to food, the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail position before moving.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when head moves to food, the snake grows, so the tail stays, and new segment is added where tail was or something.\n> \n> The problem says: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food, and \"snake positions\" include head and body.\n> \n> When head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, and the snake grows by one segment. So, after moving to food, the head is on food, and the body includes the previous positions, but since it grows, the tail doesn't advance; a new segment is added at the end.\n> \n> For example, before move: positions [A,B,C,D] with A head, D tail.\n> \n> Move head to new cell E. If E has food, then positions become [E,A,B,C,D], so length increases.\n> \n> If no food, positions become [E,A,B,C], D is removed.\n> \n> In this case, on turn 14, if I move to (1,6), which has food, so after move: head at (1,6), then previous head (2,6), then (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), so positions: [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)] length 5.\n> \n> Now, is there any danger? The food at (1,6) might be under the body or something? But currently, at turn 13, positions are [(3,6),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6)], so (1,6) is not occupied, it's free. After turn 13 move to (2,6), positions are [(2,6),(3,6),(4,6),(5,6)], so (1,6) is still free. Then moving to (1,6) should be fine.\n> \n> But there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n> \n> In this case, when I move to (1,6), the tail is at (5,6), which is not adjacent to (1,6); (1,6) and (5,6) are not adjacent, since |1-5|=4 >1, so not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (1,6) and (5,6) are not adjacent, so no danger.\n> \n> Also, the food is at (1,6), not on the tail cell. Tail is at (5,6) or whatever, not relevant.\n> \n> So eating (1,6) seems safe and possible by turn 14.\n> \n> But is it the best move? I should consider other options.\n> \n> Another food is at (4,4), which has life span 4, so I have until turn 16 to eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) and (6,1) have longer life.\n> \n> But (1,6) expires soon, so I might prioritize it.\n> \n> But let's see the risks.\n> \n> If I go for (1,6), I need to move left twice.\n> \n> After eating it, I'll be at (1,6) with a longer snake, and then I need to think about next moves.\n> \n> The grid has walls, and internal obstacle.\n> \n> Also, after being at (1,6), where can I go?\n> \n> From (1,6), possible moves: up, down, left, right.\n> \n> But y=7 is wall, so up to (1,7) invalid.\n> \n> Left to (0,6): x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Right to (2,6): but (2,6) is part of the body?

It's turn 13, and the grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,2). The snake is at positions: head at (3,6), then (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). So the snake is horizontal, facing left, since head direction is L. The tail is at (6,6), and it's 4 segments long.\n> \n> Now, the food items:\n> \n> - (1,6) with life span 2, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (4,4) with life span 4, value +1\n> \n> - (4,2) with life span 7, value +1\n> \n> - (6,1) with life span 10, value +1\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. That's good; I don't have to worry about penalties.\n> \n> Life span decreases each turn, so I need to consider how long each food will last. For example, the food at (1,6) has life span 2, meaning it will disappear after 2 more turns, including this one. So if I don't eat it by turn 14, it's gone. Life span is given at turn t1=13, so:\n> \n> - Food at (1,6): life span 2, so it disappears after turn 14. That means it can be eaten on turn 13 or 14.\n> \n> - Food at (4,4): life span 4, disappears after turn 16.\n> \n> - Food at (4,2): life span 7, disappears after turn 19.\n> \n> - Food at (6,1): life span 10, disappears after turn 22.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (3,6), facing left. Current direction is L, so I can move U, D, or L, but not R because that would be instant reverse. Since it's facing left, opposite is right, so I cannot move right on the next turn.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,6):\n> \n> - Up: to (3,7) – but y=7 is a wall, so that's out of bounds. Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=7 is a wall, so moving up to (3,7) is invalid; it would cause a wall collision.\n> \n> - Down: to (3,5) – y=5 is within bounds, and no wall mentioned except borders, so should be ok.\n> \n> - Left: to (2,6) – x=2, y=6, should be within bounds.\n> \n> - Right: to (4,6) – but (4,6) is occupied by the snake's body. The snake positions are [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)], so (4,6) is the second segment. Moving right would cause a body collision immediately, since head would touch the body segment at (4,6). So that's deadly.\n> \n> Also, walls: borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), I assume, with walls on those lines.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), but that's not relevant for current position.\n> \n> So from (3,6), possible safe moves:\n> \n> - Down to (3,5)\n> \n> - Left to (2,6)\n> \n> Up is wall, right is body collision, so only down or left.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Food locations:\n> \n> - (1,6) is at row 6, column 1. Since snake is at row 6, and (1,6) is left, but at same y.\n> \n> - (4,4) is down-left from head.\n> \n> - (4,2) is down, but with obstacle at (3,2), so need to go around.\n> \n> - (6,1) is down-right.\n> \n> Also, the food at (1,6) has short life, only 2 turns left.

That should be possible.\n> \n> But let's check if it's safe.\n> \n> After moving left to (2,6) on turn 13, snake positions would be: head at (2,6), then body at (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). Tail is still at (6,6), but when I move, the tail moves? Let's see how snake moves.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail segment is removed unless I eat food.\n> \n> If I don't eat food, length remains same, tail moves.\n> \n> So after moving left to (2,6) on turn 13:\n> \n> - Head to (2,6)\n> \n> - Then body: (3,6) from old head, (4,6) from old second, (5,6) from old third. Old tail at (6,6) is gone, so positions: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)]\n> \n> Now, on turn 14, if I move left to (1,6), I eat the food there. Since it's positive, length increases by one.\n> \n> So after eating: head to (1,6), then body: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), and since I ate, a new segment is added, so tail is now at (5,6)? Let's clarify.\n> \n> When I eat food, the snake grows, so after moving to food, the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail position before moving.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when head moves to food, the snake grows, so the tail stays, and new segment is added where tail was or something.\n> \n> The problem says: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food, and \"snake positions\" include head and body.\n> \n> When head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, and the snake grows by one segment. So, after moving to food, the head is on food, and the body includes the previous positions, but since it grows, the tail doesn't advance; a new segment is added at the end.\n> \n> For example, before move: positions [A,B,C,D] with A head, D tail.\n> \n> Move head to new cell E. If E has food, then positions become [E,A,B,C,D], so length increases.\n> \n> If no food, positions become [E,A,B,C], D is removed.\n> \n> In this case, on turn 14, if I move to (1,6), which has food, so after move: head at (1,6), then previous head (2,6), then (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), so positions: [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)] length 5.\n> \n> Now, is there any danger? The food at (1,6) might be under the body or something? But currently, at turn 13, positions are [(3,6),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6)], so (1,6) is not occupied, it's free. After turn 13 move to (2,6), positions are [(2,6),(3,6),(4,6),(5,6)], so (1,6) is still free. Then moving to (1,6) should be fine.\n> \n> But there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n> \n> In this case, when I move to (1,6), the tail is at (5,6), which is not adjacent to (1,6); (1,6) and (5,6) are not adjacent, since |1-5|=4 >1, so not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (1,6) and (5,6) are not adjacent, so no danger.\n> \n> Also, the food is at (1,6), not on the tail cell. Tail is at (5,6) or whatever, not relevant.\n> \n> So eating (1,6) seems safe and possible by turn 14.\n> \n> But is it the best move?

It's turn 15, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls occupy the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the snake can only be in cells where x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6, I think. But let's see the snake positions: [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)]. y=6 is one below y=7, so y=6 is playable since y=7 is wall. Similarly, x=1 to x=5, all within 1 to 6. x=6 is also playable since x=7 is wall. So grid is 1 to 6 in both x and y.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake head is at (1,6), and direction is L, which is left, so moving west.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,4) with life span 2, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (4,2) with life span 5, value +1\n> \n> - (6,1) with life span 8, value +1\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Value 1 for all, so +1 each.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (1,6), then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). So it's horizontal at y=6, from x=1 to x=5, head left, so tail is at (5,6).\n> \n> Since head is moving left, from (1,6), if it moves left, it would go to (0,6), but x=0 is wall, so it can't move left. Current head direction is L, but it can't go left because (0,6) is wall.\n> \n> The movement constraints say: in each turn you can choose to move, but no instant reverse. Since current direction is L, I cannot move right (which is opposite) on the next turn. But I can move up, down, or left, but left is blocked.\n> \n> Possible moves from current head position (1,6):\n> \n> - Up: (1,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Down: (1,5) which is within bounds, no wall there.\n> \n> - Left: (0,6) x=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Right: (2,6) but (2,6) is the second segment of the snake body. Is that a collision?\n> \n> Body collision: head touches any body segment. But there's an exception: you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move forward.\n> \n> Let's see the snake positions: [(1,6) head, (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) tail].\n> \n> If head moves right to (2,6), which is currently occupied by the body. But (2,6) is not the tail; tail is at (5,6). So moving to (2,6) would cause collision with body, deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left to (0,6) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> Moving up to (1,7) wall, invalid.\n> \n> Moving down to (1,5) is empty, I assume, since no food or obstacle there.\n> \n> Food is at (4,4), (4,2), (6,1), none at (1,5).\n> \n> Also, walls: internal obstacle at (3,2), not near here.\n> \n> So from (1,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - Down: to (1,5) - valid, no collision.\n> \n> - Left: to (0,6) - wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Up: to (1,7) - wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Right: to (2,6) - body segment, not tail, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is down to (1,5).\n> \n> Is that right? Current direction is L, left. But since it can't go left, and no reverse issue because moving down is not opposite to left.\n> \n> Opposite directions: U/D, L/R. So from L, opposite is R. But moving down is perpendicular, not opposite, so it should be allowed.\n> \n> And since only down is possible, I have to move down.\n> \n> But the action is for turn t1=15, I need to choose action for turn 15.\n> \n> In the sequence, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, for turn 15, I must move down to (1,5), as it's the only choice.\n> \n> Then, after moving, snake positions will be: new head at (1,5), then the body: since head moved to (1,5), the segment that was at (1,6) becomes part of body, so the new positions: head (1,5), then (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), and tail (5,6) will move to (4,6)? Let's think how snake moves.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, and each segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So:\n> \n> - Head was at (1,6), moves to (1,5)\n> \n> - Then, the first body segment at (2,6) moves to where head was, (1,6)\n> \n> - Second body segment at (3,6) moves to (2,6)\n> \n> - Third at (4,6) moves to (3,6)\n> \n> - Tail at (5,6) moves to (4,6)\n> \n> So new snake positions: [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n> \n> Head now at (1,5), and direction after move: since I moved down, new head direction is D.\n> \n> Now, food: all food has life span decreasing. Current turn is 15, food:\n> \n> - (4,4): life span 2, so after turn 15, it will have 1 turn left? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> The food info is given at turn 15: (4,4,2,1) means at turn 15, it has life span 2, so it will disappear after 2 more turns, i.e., at turn 17 it will be gone if not eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2,5,1) life span 5, disappears at turn 20.\n> \n> (6,1,8,1) life span 8, disappears at turn 23.\n> \n> But we need to see if we can eat them.\n> \n> Now, for turn 16 and beyond, I need to plan.\n> \n> First, from current position (1,5), head direction D (down).\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is D, I cannot move up (opposite), but I can move down, left, right.\n> \n> From (1,5):\n> \n> - Down: to (1,4)\n> \n> - Left: to (0,5) x=0 wall, invalid\n> \n> - Right: to (2,5)\n> \n> - Up: to (1,6) but (1,6) is now a body segment?

Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> At turn 15, life span 2: it will exist for 2 more turns, including turn 15. So at turn 15, if not eaten, life span decreases to 1. Then at turn 16, if eaten, ok, else after turn 16, it disappears, so not available on turn 17.\n> \n> Similarly, life span N: disappears after N turns from current, so available for N turns including current.\n> \n> For (4,4) at turn 15: life span 2, so available on turn 15 and 16, gone on turn 17.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) life span 5, available turns 15 to 19, gone on 20.\n> \n> (6,1) life span 8, available turns 15 to 22, gone on 23.\n> \n> Now, turn 15 action: we must move down to (1,5), as established.\n> \n> Then for turn 16, from (1,5), we can go down to (1,4) or right to (2,5).\n> \n> I need to aim for food, but also avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food at (4,4) which is about to disappear soon.

But (1,6) is body, invalid; (0,5) wall; so only (1,4) or (2,5). Neither is (4,4), so we cannot reach (4,4) on turn 16 from (1,5). Therefore, it is impossible to eat (4,4) before it disappears. So we should ignore this food, as it's not reachable in time.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (4,2) and (6,1) have more time.\n> \n> (4,2) life span 5, so available until turn 19.\n> \n> (6,1) life span 8, until turn 22.\n> \n> Now, snake is at (1,5) after turn 15.\n> \n> Head direction down.\n> \n> For turn 16, I need to choose action.\n> \n> Options: move down to (1,4) or right to (2,5).\n> \n> I need to think long-term towards other food.\n> \n> Also, there is an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid rows y from 1 to 6, bottom to top? Usually in coordinates, y increases up, but in snake, sometimes y increases down, but here positions given: (1,6), (2,6), etc., and walls y=0 and y=7, with y=7 top or bottom?\n> \n> Walls: y=0 and y=7. Snake at y=6, which is near y=7. Since y=0 and y=7 are walls, and y=6 is playable, so y=6 is adjacent to top wall if y=7 is top, or bottom if y=7 bottom. But since head direction is down, which decreases y, I think y increases upwards? Let's see.\n> \n> In the position, from (1,6) to (1,5) is down, so y decreases as we go down.

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state at Turn \\( t_0 = 16 \\):\n\n- **Grid Dimensions**: Playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), with walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n- **Internal Obstacle**: (3,2) is blocked.\n- **Snake**:\n  - Positions: [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] (head at (1,5), tail at (4,6))\n  - Current direction: Down (D)\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,4): value=1, life_span=1 (disappears after Turn 16)\n  - (4,2): value=1, life_span=4 (disappears after Turn 19)\n  - (6,1): value=1, life_span=7 (disappears after Turn 22)\n  - (4,3): value=1, life_span=10 (disappears after Turn 25)\n\nFrom the previous thinking model's output at Turn 15, the snake was forced to move Down to (1,5) because other directions were blocked or led to collisions. Now, at Turn 16, the snake is at (1,5) with direction Down.\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 16\n\nFrom (1,5), with current direction Down, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Down (D)**: (1,4)\n   - Check: (1,4) is within bounds, not a wall, and not occupied by the snake's body (current body segments are at (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)). Valid.\n2. **Left (L)**: (0,5)\n   - Check: x=0 is a wall. Invalid.\n3. **Right (R)**: (2,5)\n   - Check: (2,5) is within bounds. Is it occupied by the snake's body? Current body segments are at (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). (2,5) is not in this list. Valid.\n4. **Up (U)**: (1,6)\n   - Check: (1,6) is the first body segment after the head. Moving here would collide with the body (not the tail, since tail is at (4,6)). Invalid.\n\nAdditionally, we cannot make an instant reverse. Current direction is Down, so Up is the reverse, which is already invalid due to collision. So, possible valid moves: Down (D) or Right (R).\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\n**Option 1: Move Down to (1,4)**\n\n- New head position: (1,4)\n- New direction: Down\n- New snake positions: [(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)]\n  - Tail moves from (4,6) to (3,6)\n  \nFrom (1,4), possible next moves (for future planning):\n- Down to (1,3)\n- Right to (2,4)\n- Up to (1,5) (body segment, invalid unless it's the tail, but tail is at (3,6))\n  \nSo, from (1,4), can move Down or Right.\n\n**Option 2: Move Right to (2,5)**\n\n- New head position: (2,5)\n- New direction: Right\n- New snake positions: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)]\n  - Tail moves from (4,6) to (3,6)\n\nFrom (2,5), possible next moves (for future planning):\n- Right to (3,5)\n- Down to (2,4)\n- Up to (2,6) (body segment, invalid unless tail, but tail is at (3,6))\n  \nSo, from (2,5), can move Right or Down.\n\n### Food Accessibility\n\nNow, let's assess if any food is reachable within its lifespan.\n\n1. **Food at (4,4)**: life_span=1 (disappears after Turn 16)\n   - To eat at Turn 16, head must be at (4,4) at Turn 16.\n   - Current head is at (1,5). Distance: |4-1| + |4-5| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n   - Need to reach in 0 moves (since action is at Turn 16, and food disappears after). Impossible. So, cannot eat (4,4).\n\n2. **Food at (4,2)**: life_span=4 (disappears after Turn 19)\n   - Must be eaten by Turn 19.\n   - From Turn 16 to 19: 4 moves (Turns 16,17,18,19).\n   - Distance from (1,5) to (4,2): |4-1| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6.\n   - Need to reach in 4 moves: impossible (minimum moves is 6 > 4).\n   - Cannot eat (4,2).\n\n3. **Food at (6,1)**: life_span=7 (disappears after Turn 22)\n   - Must be eaten by Turn 22.\n   - From Turn 16 to 22: 7 moves.\n   - Distance from (1,5) to (6,1): |6-1| + |1-5| = 5 + 4 = 9.\n   - Need to reach in 7 moves: impossible (minimum moves is 9 > 7).\n   - Cannot eat (6,1).\n\n4. **Food at (4,3)**: life_span=10 (disappears after Turn 25)\n   - Must be eaten by Turn 25.\n   - From Turn 16 to 25: 10 moves.\n   - Distance from (1,5) to (4,3): |4-1| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5.\n   - Possible to reach in 5 moves, but need to check path with obstacle at (3,2).\n   - Example path: \n     - Turn 16: R to (2,5)\n     - Turn 17: R to (3,5)\n     - Turn 18: D to (3,4)\n     - Turn 19: D to (3,3) (but (3,2) is blocked, so cannot go down further)\n     - Turn 20: R to (4,3) (eat here at Turn 20)\n   - But need to eat by Turn 25, so this is possible.\n   - However, the previous thinking model concluded that all food is unreachable, which seems incorrect for (4,3).\n\nWait, the previous thinking model might have missed (4,3) because it focused on (4,2) and (6,1). Let's re-examine:\n\nFrom (1,5), to reach (4,3):\n\nOption: Move Right first\n- Turn 16: R to (2,5)\n- Turn 17: R to (3,5)\n- Turn 18: D to (3,4)\n- Turn 19: D to (3,3)\n- Turn 20: R to (4,3) (eat here)\n\nThis takes 5 moves (Turns 16-20), and food is available until Turn 25, so this is feasible.\n\nSimilarly, another path:\n- Turn 16: D to (1,4)\n- Turn 17: D to (1,3)\n- Turn 18: R to (2,3)\n- Turn 19: R to (3,3)\n- Turn 20: R to (4,3) (eat here)\n\nAlso 5 moves.\n\nSo, (4,3) is reachable by Turn 20, well within its lifespan (disappears after Turn 25).\n\n### Decision for Turn 16\n\nGiven that (4,3) is reachable, we should aim to eat it. The two possible initial moves are:\n\n1. **Move Down to (1,4)**:\n   - Then path: D, D, R, R, R to (4,3) by Turn 20.\n2. **Move Right to (2,5)**:\n   - Then path: R, R, D, D, R to (4,3) by Turn 20.\n\nBoth are feasible. Let's choose the first one for simplicity (moving down first).\n\n### Action Sequence to Reach (4,3)\n\n- **Turn 16**: D to (1,4)\n- **Turn 17**: D to (1,3)\n- **Turn 18**: R to (2,3)\n- **Turn 19**: R to (3,3)\n- **Turn 20**: R to (4,3) (eat here)\n\nThis sequence ensures we reach the food at (4,3) by Turn 20.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Check if the tail has food under it at any point where the head is adjacent to the tail. Currently, no food is under the snake's body, so no danger.\n- **Collisions**: Each move is to an empty cell or the tail (which moves away), so no collisions.\n\n### Final Decision\n\n\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 16 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(3, 2)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: D\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (4, 4, 1, 1)\n\t- (4, 2, 4, 1)\n\t- (6, 1, 7, 1)\n\t- (4, 3, 10, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 15 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 15, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls occupy the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the snake can only be in cells where x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6, I think. But let's see the snake positions: [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)]. y=6 is one below y=7, so y=6 is playable since y=7 is wall. Similarly, x=1 to x=5, all within 1 to 6. x=6 is also playable since x=7 is wall. So grid is 1 to 6 in both x and y.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake head is at (1,6), and direction is L, which is left, so moving west.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,4) with life span 2, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (4,2) with life span 5, value +1\n> \n> - (6,1) with life span 8, value +1\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Value 1 for all, so +1 each.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (1,6), then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). So it's horizontal at y=6, from x=1 to x=5, head left, so tail is at (5,6).\n> \n> Since head is moving left, from (1,6), if it moves left, it would go to (0,6), but x=0 is wall, so it can't move left. Current head direction is L, but it can't go left because (0,6) is wall.\n> \n> The movement constraints say: in each turn you can choose to move, but no instant reverse. Since current direction is L, I cannot move right (which is opposite) on the next turn. But I can move up, down, or left, but left is blocked.\n> \n> Possible moves from current head position (1,6):\n> \n> - Up: (1,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Down: (1,5) which is within bounds, no wall there.\n> \n> - Left: (0,6) x=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Right: (2,6) but (2,6) is the second segment of the snake body.

So moving to (2,6) would cause collision with body, deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left to (0,6) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> Moving up to (1,7) wall, invalid.\n> \n> Moving down to (1,5) is empty, I assume, since no food or obstacle there.\n> \n> Food is at (4,4), (4,2), (6,1), none at (1,5).\n> \n> Also, walls: internal obstacle at (3,2), not near here.\n> \n> So from (1,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - Down: to (1,5) - valid, no collision.\n> \n> - Left: to (0,6) - wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Up: to (1,7) - wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Right: to (2,6) - body segment, not tail, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is down to (1,5).\n> \n> Is that right? Current direction is L, left. But since it can't go left, and no reverse issue because moving down is not opposite to left.\n> \n> Opposite directions: U/D, L/R. So from L, opposite is R.

Let's think how snake moves.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, and each segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So:\n> \n> - Head was at (1,6), moves to (1,5)\n> \n> - Then, the first body segment at (2,6) moves to where head was, (1,6)\n> \n> - Second body segment at (3,6) moves to (2,6)\n> \n> - Third at (4,6) moves to (3,6)\n> \n> - Tail at (5,6) moves to (4,6)\n> \n> So new snake positions: [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n> \n> Head now at (1,5), and direction after move: since I moved down, new head direction is D.\n> \n> Now, food: all food has life span decreasing.

No, the number of moves is the Manhattan distance since diagonal not allowed.\n> \n> From (1,5) to (4,4), we need to change x by 3 and y by 1, so min 4 moves: e.g., right, right, right, down; or down, right, right, right, etc. But we need to be at (4,4) on some turn.\n> \n> Currently at turn 15 end: head at (1,5)\n> \n> Turn 16: move somewhere.\n> \n> Turn 17: move again.\n> \n> But (4,4) disappears after turn 16, meaning it is not available on turn 17.

But (1,6) is body, invalid; (0,5) wall; so only (1,4) or (2,5). Neither is (4,4), so we cannot reach (4,4) on turn 16 from (1,5). Therefore, it is impossible to eat (4,4) before it disappears. So we should ignore this food, as it's not reachable in time.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (4,2) and (6,1) have more time.\n> \n> (4,2) life span 5, so available until turn 19.\n> \n> (6,1) life span 8, until turn 22.\n> \n> Now, snake is at (1,5) after turn 15.\n> \n> Head direction down.\n> \n> For turn 16, I need to choose action.\n> \n> Options: move down to (1,4) or right to (2,5).\n> \n> I need to think long-term towards other food.\n> \n> Also, there is an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid rows y from 1 to 6, bottom to top?

Snake at y=6, which is near y=7. Since y=0 and y=7 are walls, and y=6 is playable, so y=6 is adjacent to top wall if y=7 is top, or bottom if y=7 bottom. But since head direction is down, which decreases y, I think y increases upwards? Let's see.\n> \n> In the position, from (1,6) to (1,5) is down, so y decreases as we go down.

Since the head is at (1,4) and moving down, but the next segment is (1,5), which is south, so if it's moving down, y decreases? Let me clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> The grid: y=0 is probably the bottom, y=7 top? But movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if y increases up, then U is up, D is down. But typically in grids, y=0 is bottom, so D (down) would decrease y.\n> \n> In the snake positions: head (1,4), then (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6). If moving down, from (1,4) to (1,5)? That would be increasing y, but D is (x,y-1), which decreases y. Inconsistency here.\n> \n> Head direction is given as D, down. But the positions: from head to body: (1,4) to (1,5) to (1,6). If head is at (1,4) and moving down (D), which should be to (1,3), but the next segment is (1,5), which has higher y, meaning it was previously above? Let's think about the movement.\n> \n> The snake positions are listed as [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] with head first. So head is (1,4), then the body segments follow. The direction is given as D, meaning the snake is currently moving downward.\n> \n> But if it's moving downward, from where? The previous head position must have been above. Let's see the sequence: positions (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). (1,6) is the tail end? (1,6) to (2,6) to (3,6), so the tail is at (3,6).\n> \n> Since head is at (1,4) and moving down (D), that means next move should decrease y. But the body segment at (1,5) is directly above it? If head is at (1,4) and moving down to, say, (1,3), but the body is at (1,5), which is north of head.\n> \n> Perhaps the coordinate system: let's assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, so U (up) increases y, D (down) decreases y.\n> \n> Head at (1,4), moving down, so it came from (1,5)? But the position list has (1,4) then (1,5), meaning (1,5) is the first body segment after head. So if head is at (1,4), and it was moving down, it must have come from a cell with higher y, like (1,5), but (1,5) is now the body segment. So the snake was previously at head (1,5), moved down to (1,4), so now head is (1,4), and the old head is now body at (1,5), and so on.\n> \n> Similarly, the segment at (1,6) is the previous position before that.\n> \n> Then (1,6) to (2,6) to (3,6), so it must have turned left or something at (1,6) to go to (2,6).\n> \n> But direction is given as current head direction, which is D, so from (1,4), moving down, next move could be to (1,3).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (4,2) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,1) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,3) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn, including current. So at turn 17, life span 4 means it will disappear after 4 more turns, so at turn 21 it's gone? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns, meaning it lasts for N turns including the current one? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (4,2) with life span 4 on turn 17: it will disappear after 4 turns, so on turn 21 it is gone. Similarly, (6,1) life span 6, disappears after turn 22 (17+6-1? Let's calculate properly.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, on turn t, with life span L, it has L turns left including turn t. So after L turns, it disappears. For example, on turn 17, L=4, so it will be there on turn 17,18,19,20, and disappear before turn 21. So last chance to eat is turn 20.\n> \n> Similarly, L=6 for (6,1): present on turns 17 to 22, disappear before turn 23.\n> \n> L=9 for (4,3): present on turns 17 to 25, disappear before turn 26.\n> \n> Now, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so grid is from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x:1 to 6, y:1 to 6? But y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Also internal obstacle at (3,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Grid size: since borders at x=0,7 and y=0,7, the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, so 6x6 grid.\n> \n> Cells: (1,1) to (6,6), but (3,2) is wall, so not accessible.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (1,4), body (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6).

Since the head is at (1,4) and moving down, but the next segment is (1,5), which is south, so if it's moving down, y decreases? Let me clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> The grid: y=0 is probably the bottom, y=7 top? But movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if y increases up, then U is up, D is down. But typically in grids, y=0 is bottom, so D (down) would decrease y.\n> \n> In the snake positions: head (1,4), then (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6). If moving down, from (1,4) to (1,5)? That would be increasing y, but D is (x,y-1), which decreases y. Inconsistency here.\n> \n> Head direction is given as D, down. But the positions: from head to body: (1,4) to (1,5) to (1,6). If head is at (1,4) and moving down (D), which should be to (1,3), but the next segment is (1,5), which has higher y, meaning it was previously above? Let's think about the movement.\n> \n> The snake positions are listed as [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] with head first. So head is (1,4), then the body segments follow. The direction is given as D, meaning the snake is currently moving downward.\n> \n> But if it's moving downward, from where? The previous head position must have been above. Let's see the sequence: positions (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). (1,6) is the tail end? (1,6) to (2,6) to (3,6), so the tail is at (3,6).\n> \n> Since head is at (1,4) and moving down (D), that means next move should decrease y. But the body segment at (1,5) is directly above it? If head is at (1,4) and moving down to, say, (1,3), but the body is at (1,5), which is north of head.\n> \n> Perhaps the coordinate system: let's assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, so U (up) increases y, D (down) decreases y.\n> \n> Head at (1,4), moving down, so it came from (1,5)? But the position list has (1,4) then (1,5), meaning (1,5) is the first body segment after head. So if head is at (1,4), and it was moving down, it must have come from a cell with higher y, like (1,5), but (1,5) is now the body segment. So the snake was previously at head (1,5), moved down to (1,4), so now head is (1,4), and the old head is now body at (1,5), and so on.\n> \n> Similarly, the segment at (1,6) is the previous position before that.\n> \n> Then (1,6) to (2,6) to (3,6), so it must have turned left or something at (1,6) to go to (2,6).\n> \n> But direction is given as current head direction, which is D, so from (1,4), moving down, next move could be to (1,3).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (4,2) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,1) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,3) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn, including current. So at turn 17, life span 4 means it will disappear after 4 more turns, so at turn 21 it's gone? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns, meaning it lasts for N turns including the current one? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (4,2) with life span 4 on turn 17: it will disappear after 4 turns, so on turn 21 it is gone. Similarly, (6,1) life span 6, disappears after turn 22 (17+6-1? Let's calculate properly.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, on turn t, with life span L, it has L turns left including turn t. So after L turns, it disappears. For example, on turn 17, L=4, so it will be there on turn 17,18,19,20, and disappear before turn 21. So last chance to eat is turn 20.\n> \n> Similarly, L=6 for (6,1): present on turns 17 to 22, disappear before turn 23.\n> \n> L=9 for (4,3): present on turns 17 to 25, disappear before turn 26.\n> \n> Now, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so grid is from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x:1 to 6, y:1 to 6?

Cannot move L (Left) because it's the reverse of the current direction (R).\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,2): Life span 2 (expires after Turn 20), value +1.\n  - (6,1): Life span 4 (expires after Turn 22), value +1.\n  - (4,3): Life span 7 (expires after Turn 25), value +1.\n  - (3,1): Life span 10 (expires after Turn 28), value +1.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Food at (4,2)**:\n   - Must be eaten by Turn 20 (next turn).\n   - From (3,4), cannot reach (4,2) in one move (not adjacent).\n   - Even if we move towards it (e.g., R to (4,4) or D to (3,3)), we cannot reach (4,2) by Turn 20 due to the wall at (3,2) blocking the path.\n   - Conclusion: Cannot eat (4,2) in time. Ignore it.\n\n2. **Other Food**:\n   - (4,3): Closest, can be eaten soon.\n   - (6,1) and (3,1): Further away, but plenty of time.\n\n3. **Possible Moves from (3,4)**:\n   - **U (Up) to (3,5)**:\n     - No food at (3,5).\n     - Safe move, but not directly beneficial.\n   - **D (Down) to (3,3)**:\n     - No food at (3,3).\n     - Next turn (Turn 20), from (3,3), can move R to (4,3) to eat (4,3).\n   - **R (Right) to (4,4)**:\n     - No food at (4,4).\n     - Next turn (Turn 20), from (4,4), can move D to (4,3) to eat (4,3).\n\n### Optimal Path:\n- The best immediate action is to move towards the closest food (4,3) while ensuring safety.\n- Moving **D (Down) to (3,3)** sets up the snake to move R to (4,3) on Turn 20, eating the food there.\n- Moving **R (Right) to (4,4)** also sets up the snake to move D to (4,3) on Turn 20, but this is less direct and risks missing other opportunities.\n\n### Decision:\n- Move **D (Down) to (3,3)** to prepare for eating (4,3) on the next turn.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

There's an internal obstacle at (3,2), which is a wall cell.\n> \n> Current turn is 19.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,4), then (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). So the snake is shaped like this: head at (3,4), body to the left at (2,4), then down to (1,4), then up to (1,5), and up to (1,6). Let me sketch this.\n> \n> - (1,6) is the tail.\n> \n> - (1,5)\n> \n> - (1,4) is the body\n> \n> - (2,4) is the body\n> \n> - (3,4) is head\n> \n> And head direction is right, meaning it was moving right to get to (3,4) from (2,4), I assume? Positions are given in order, so from head to tail: (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (1,4) -> (1,5) -> (1,6). So the snake is moving right to (3,4), but before that, it was at (2,4) going right? Let's see the path.\n> \n> From tail: (1,6) to (1,5) is down? y=6 to y=5, so moving down to (1,5). Then (1,5) to (1,4) is down again to (1,4). Then (1,4) to (2,4) is right to (2,4). Then (2,4) to (3,4) is right to (3,4). So current head direction is R, which matches moving right.\n> \n> Now food:\n> \n> - (4,2) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,1) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,3) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,1) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Value 1 for all, and different life spans.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 19, for (4,2) life span 2, it will disappear after 2 more turns? Life span is the number of turns it remains, including current, so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns from now? Let me read the rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span L, it will be present from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and disappear at turn t + L. Countdown decreases each turn, so at turn t, countdown is L, at turn t+1, it's L-1, ..., at turn t+L-1, it's 1, and then gone.\n> \n> In this case, turn 19:\n> \n> - (4,2): life span 2, so countdown: at turn 19: 2, turn 20: 1, turn 21: gone.\n> \n> - (6,1): life span 4, so turn 19:4, 20:3, 21:2, 22:1, gone at 23.\n> \n> - (4,3): life span 7, so present from 19 to 25 (since 19+7-1=25), gone at 26.\n> \n> - (3,1): life span 10, present from 19 to 28, gone at 29.\n> \n> All food is positive, so eating any gives +1 score and increases length by 1.\n> \n> Now, I need to move the snake. Head is at (3,4), direction R, so I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since it was moving right, I cannot move left (L) immediately, because that would be opposite direction. Current head direction is R, so last move was to the right, so I cannot move left on this turn. So possible moves: U, D, R. L is not allowed.\n> \n> Now, grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so boundaries are from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6. Internal wall at (3,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Playable cells: (1,1) to (6,6) except (3,2).\n> \n> Snake occupies: (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). So (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) are occupied, but since the snake moves, when it moves, the tail will move away, so cells become free except where the body is.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's list the possible moves from (3,4):\n> \n> - U: up to (3,5)\n> \n> - D: down to (3,3)\n> \n> - R: right to (4,4)\n> \n> L is not possible because of no reverse.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> - (3,5): is it free? Snake positions: (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). So (3,5) is not occupied, and not a wall. Walls: x=0,7 y=0,7 and (3,2). (3,5) is within 1-6,1-6, not (3,2), so safe to move? But after moving, the head goes to (3,5), and the body: the tail (1,6) will move away if we move, but let's see the new positions.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new position, and each segment moves to the next position, so tail is removed unless we eat food.\n> \n> If I move to (3,5), new positions: head at (3,5), then body: previous head (3,4) now body, then (2,4), then (1,4), then (1,5).

However, the current state shows the snake is already at (3, 3) with direction D, so the previous plan is not directly applicable. Instead, we can directly eat the food at (4, 3) by moving **R (Right)**.\n\n### Avoiding Risks:\n- The food at (4, 2) has a life span of 1 (will disappear after this turn), but it is not adjacent to the current head (3, 3), so it cannot be eaten this turn.\n- The food at (4, 3) is safe to eat (no tail reward danger, as the tail is at (1, 5), not adjacent to the head).\n- The other foods (6, 1) and (3, 1) are too far to reach immediately.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate action is to move **R (Right)** to (4, 3) to eat the positive food there, maximizing the score and avoiding risks.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

There's an internal obstacle at (3,2), which is a wall cell.\n> \n> Current turn is 19.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,4), then (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). So the snake is shaped like this: head at (3,4), body to the left at (2,4), then down to (1,4), then up to (1,5), and up to (1,6). Let me sketch this.\n> \n> - (1,6) is the tail.\n> \n> - (1,5)\n> \n> - (1,4) is the body\n> \n> - (2,4) is the body\n> \n> - (3,4) is head\n> \n> And head direction is right, meaning it was moving right to get to (3,4) from (2,4), I assume? Positions are given in order, so from head to tail: (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (1,4) -> (1,5) -> (1,6). So the snake is moving right to (3,4), but before that, it was at (2,4) going right? Let's see the path.\n> \n> From tail: (1,6) to (1,5) is down? y=6 to y=5, so moving down to (1,5). Then (1,5) to (1,4) is down again to (1,4). Then (1,4) to (2,4) is right to (2,4). Then (2,4) to (3,4) is right to (3,4).

Life span is the number of turns it remains, including current, so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns from now? Let me read the rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

Countdown decreases each turn, so at turn t, countdown is L, at turn t+1, it's L-1, ..., at turn t+L-1, it's 1, and then gone.\n> \n> In this case, turn 19:\n> \n> - (4,2): life span 2, so countdown: at turn 19: 2, turn 20: 1, turn 21: gone.\n> \n> - (6,1): life span 4, so turn 19:4, 20:3, 21:2, 22:1, gone at 23.\n> \n> - (4,3): life span 7, so present from 19 to 25 (since 19+7-1=25), gone at 26.\n> \n> - (3,1): life span 10, present from 19 to 28, gone at 29.\n> \n> All food is positive, so eating any gives +1 score and increases length by 1.\n> \n> Now, I need to move the snake. Head is at (3,4), direction R, so I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since it was moving right, I cannot move left (L) immediately, because that would be opposite direction.

L is not allowed.\n> \n> Now, grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so boundaries are from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6.

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State (Turn 21)\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state at Turn 21 based on the provided information:\n\n- **Grid Dimensions**: The playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), with walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n  \n- **Snake**:\n  - Positions: [(4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5)]\n    - Head: (4, 3)\n    - Body: (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5) (tail)\n  - Head Direction: R (right)\n\n- **Food**:\n  - (6, 1): value = 1, life_span = 3 (will disappear after Turn 23)\n  - (3, 1): value = 1, life_span = 8 (will disappear after Turn 28)\n\n### Previous Plan from Turn 19\n\nFrom the previous thinking model at Turn 19, the plan was to:\n\n1. Move R to (4,4) at Turn 19.\n2. Move D to (4,3) at Turn 20 to eat the food there.\n3. Then proceed towards (3,1) by moving left and down in subsequent turns.\n\nHowever, we're now at Turn 21, and the snake's position is [(4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5)], which suggests that the snake has already eaten the food at (4,3) (since the length is now 6, up from the initial length at Turn 19 which was 5). \n\nThis implies that the moves at Turn 19 (R to (4,4)) and Turn 20 (D to (4,3)) have already been executed, and now we're at Turn 21 deciding the next move.\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 21\n\nGiven the snake's head is at (4,3) and the current direction is R (right), the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (4,4)\n   - Check if (4,4) is free:\n     - Not part of the snake's body: The body is at (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5). (4,4) is not in this list.\n     - Not a wall: Walls are at borders and (3,2). (4,4) is not a wall.\n   - So, (4,4) is free.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (4,2)\n   - Check if (4,2) is free:\n     - Not part of the snake's body.\n     - Not a wall.\n     - However, the food at (6,1) has a life_span of 3, meaning it will disappear after Turn 23. (4,2) is not a food position in the current state, so it's just an empty cell.\n   - So, (4,2) is free.\n\n3. **Left (L)**: (3,3)\n   - Check if (3,3) is free:\n     - It's part of the snake's body (second segment).\n     - However, the tail is at (1,5), and when the snake moves, the tail will move away unless we eat food (which we're not at (3,3)).\n     - But moving left would reverse the direction from right to left, which is not allowed (no instant reverse rule).\n   - So, L is not allowed.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: (5,3)\n   - Check if (5,3) is free:\n     - Not part of the snake's body.\n     - Not a wall.\n   - So, (5,3) is free.\n\nHowever, the \"no instant reverse\" rule states that you cannot move in the opposite direction of the current head direction on the next turn. The current head direction is R (right), so the opposite is L (left). Therefore, L is not allowed, but U, D, and R are allowed.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible moves (U, D, R):\n\n1. **Up (U) to (4,4)**:\n   - No food at (4,4).\n   - New head position: (4,4)\n   - Body: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)\n   - Tail (1,5) is removed.\n   - This move doesn't eat any food but moves the snake upwards, potentially opening space.\n\n2. **Down (D) to (4,2)**:\n   - No food at (4,2).\n   - New head position: (4,2)\n   - Body: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)\n   - Tail (1,5) is removed.\n   - This moves the snake downwards, but (4,2) is close to the wall at (3,2), which might limit future movements.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (5,3)**:\n   - No food at (5,3).\n   - New head position: (5,3)\n   - Body: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)\n   - Tail (1,5) is removed.\n   - Moves the snake to the right, towards the food at (6,1).\n\n### Considering the Food\n\nThe remaining foods are at (6,1) and (3,1):\n\n- **(6,1)**:\n  - Life_span: 3 (disappears after Turn 23)\n  - Distance from (4,3): |6-4| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4 moves away.\n  - To reach (6,1) by Turn 23, we have Turns 21, 22, and 23 (3 moves).\n  - So, it's possible if we move directly towards it:\n    - Turn 21: R to (5,3)\n    - Turn 22: R to (6,3)\n    - Turn 23: D to (6,1) (eat the food)\n  \n- **(3,1)**:\n  - Life_span: 8 (disappears after Turn 28)\n  - More time is available, so we can plan to eat this after (6,1).\n\n### Potential Path to (6,1)\n\nIf we choose to go for (6,1):\n\n1. Turn 21: R to (5,3)\n2. Turn 22: R to (6,3)\n3. Turn 23: D to (6,1) (eat the food)\n\nThis sequence would allow us to eat the food at (6,1) before it disappears.\n\n### Checking for Collisions and Validity\n\nLet's verify each move in the sequence:\n\n- **Turn 21: R to (5,3)**:\n  - Current head at (4,3), direction R.\n  - Move R to (5,3): valid (no body or wall).\n  - New head direction: R.\n  \n- **Turn 22: R to (6,3)**:\n  - Head at (5,3), direction R.\n  - Move R to (6,3): valid (no body or wall).\n  - New head direction: R.\n  \n- **Turn 23: D to (6,1)**:\n  - Head at (6,3), direction R.\n  - Move D to (6,1): valid (no body or wall), and eats the food at (6,1).\n  - New head direction: D.\n\nNo collisions or rule violations in this path.\n\n### Alternative Moves\n\nIf we choose not to go for (6,1), perhaps because it's risky or we prefer to go for (3,1), we might consider:\n\n1. Turn 21: U to (4,4)\n   - Then possibly move towards (3,1), but this would take longer and (6,1) would disappear.\n\n2. Turn 21: D to (4,2)\n   - Then move towards (3,1), but this seems less direct and may not be as efficient.\n\nGiven that (6,1) is about to disappear soon (after Turn 23), and it's reachable within the remaining turns, it's more optimal to go for it now and then plan for (3,1) later.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action at Turn 21 is to move **Right (R)** to (5,3), initiating the path to eat the food at (6,1) before it disappears at Turn 24.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 21 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(3, 2)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: R\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (6, 1, 3, 1)\n\t- (3, 1, 8, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 19 \\)\n> <think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6). There's an internal obstacle at (3,2), which is a wall cell.\n> \n> Current turn is 19.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,4), then (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). So the snake is shaped like this: head at (3,4), body to the left at (2,4), then down to (1,4), then up to (1,5), and up to (1,6). Let me sketch this.\n> \n> - (1,6) is the tail.\n> \n> - (1,5)\n> \n> - (1,4) is the body\n> \n> - (2,4) is the body\n> \n> - (3,4) is head\n> \n> And head direction is right, meaning it was moving right to get to (3,4) from (2,4), I assume? Positions are given in order, so from head to tail: (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (1,4) -> (1,5) -> (1,6). So the snake is moving right to (3,4), but before that, it was at (2,4) going right? Let's see the path.\n> \n> From tail: (1,6) to (1,5) is down? y=6 to y=5, so moving down to (1,5). Then (1,5) to (1,4) is down again to (1,4). Then (1,4) to (2,4) is right to (2,4). Then (2,4) to (3,4) is right to (3,4). So current head direction is R, which matches moving right.\n> \n> Now food:\n> \n> - (4,2) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,1) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,3) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,1) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Value 1 for all, and different life spans.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 19, for (4,2) life span 2, it will disappear after 2 more turns? Life span is the number of turns it remains, including current, so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns from now? Let me read the rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span L, it will be present from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and disappear at turn t + L. Countdown decreases each turn, so at turn t, countdown is L, at turn t+1, it's L-1, ..., at turn t+L-1, it's 1, and then gone.\n> \n> In this case, turn 19:\n> \n> - (4,2): life span 2, so countdown: at turn 19: 2, turn 20: 1, turn 21: gone.\n> \n> - (6,1): life span 4, so turn 19:4, 20:3, 21:2, 22:1, gone at 23.\n> \n> - (4,3): life span 7, so present from 19 to 25 (since 19+7-1=25), gone at 26.\n> \n> - (3,1): life span 10, present from 19 to 28, gone at 29.\n> \n> All food is positive, so eating any gives +1 score and increases length by 1.\n> \n> Now, I need to move the snake. Head is at (3,4), direction R, so I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since it was moving right, I cannot move left (L) immediately, because that would be opposite direction. Current head direction is R, so last move was to the right, so I cannot move left on this turn. So possible moves: U, D, R. L is not allowed.\n> \n> Now, grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so boundaries are from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6. Internal wall at (3,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Playable cells: (1,1) to (6,6) except (3,2).\n> \n> Snake occupies: (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). So (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) are occupied, but since the snake moves, when it moves, the tail will move away, so cells become free except where the body is.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's list the possible moves from (3,4):\n> \n> - U: up to (3,5)\n> \n> - D: down to (3,3)\n> \n> - R: right to (4,4)\n> \n> L is not possible because of no reverse.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> - (3,5): is it free? Snake positions: (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). So (3,5) is not occupied, and not a wall. Walls: x=0,7 y=0,7 and (3,2). (3,5) is within 1-6,1-6, not (3,2), so safe to move? But after moving, the head goes to (3,5), and the body: the tail (1,6) will move away if we move, but let's see the new positions.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new position, and each segment moves to the next position, so tail is removed unless we eat food.\n> \n> If I move to (3,5), new positions: head at (3,5), then body: previous head (3,4) now body, then (2,4), then (1,4), then (1,5). Tail (1,6) is removed, so (1,6) is free now.\n> \n> Similarly for other moves.\n> \n> (3,5) is currently empty, no food there, I think. Food is at (4,2), (6,1), (4,3), (3,1). (3,5) has no food.\n> \n> Now (3,3): down to (3,3). (3,3) is not occupied by snake, not a wall, since walls are (3,2) and borders. (3,3) is y=3, x=3, not (3,2), so should be free.\n> \n> But (3,2) is wall, so (3,3) is above it, free.\n> \n> And (4,4): right to (4,4). (4,4) not occupied, not wall, free.\n> \n> Now, also, food positions: (4,2) is below, (4,3) is left-down? (4,3) is at x=4,y=3, (4,2) is x=4,y=2.\n> \n> (3,4) to (4,4) would be moving right.\n> \n> But no food at (4,4) directly.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence for 5+ turns.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid for clarity.\n> \n> Grid rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: (3,2) and borders, but borders are outside, so inside cells are all except (3,2).\n> \n> Snake: head (3,4), body (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). So (1,4) to (1,6) are occupied.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,2): value 1, life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 20 (since at turn 19 countdown 2, eaten on turn 20 countdown 1, or turn 19? If eaten on turn, it disappears, I think.\n> \n> Eating: if head moves to food cell, it eats it.\n> \n> So for (4,2), it can be eaten on turn 19 or 20, but not later, since gone at turn 21.\n> \n> Life span 2 at turn 19, so available on turn 19 and 20.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) available turn 19 to 22.\n> \n> (4,3) available turn 19 to 25.\n> \n> (3,1) available turn 19 to 28.\n> \n> Now, (4,2) is close to head at (3,4).

(3,2) is wall, cannot. So cannot go directly down from (3,4) to (3,2) because wall at (3,2).\n> \n> (3,3) is free, but (3,2) is wall, so from (3,4), if I go D to (3,3), then from (3,3), I can only go U, D, L, R, but D to (3,2) is wall, not possible.

Current direction is R, so I cannot move L (left). So possible moves: U (up, to (5,4)), D (down, to (5,2)), R (right, to (6,3)).\n> \n> Now, check if these are safe:\n> \n> - U to (5,4): is this a wall? Walls are at borders, (5,4) is x=5, y=4, both between 1-6, not a wall. Internal obstacle at (3,2), not (5,4). Snake body: positions are (5,3) head, (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4). So (5,4) is not occupied by body? Let's list all body cells: head (5,3), segment 2: (4,3), segment 3: (3,3), segment 4: (3,4), segment 5: (2,4), segment 6: (1,4). So (5,4) is free, not body, not wall. So U to (5,4) is possible.\n> \n> - D to (5,2): (5,2) - x=5, y=2, within 1-6, not wall. Internal obstacle at (3,2), not (5,2). Body: not occupied, since body is at y=3 and y=4 mostly. (5,2) not in positions. So possible.\n> \n> - R to (6,3): (6,3) - x=6, y=3. x=6 is not x=7 or x=0, so not border wall. y=3 fine. Not internal obstacle. Body: not occupied. So possible.\n> \n> Now, food locations:\n> \n> - (6,1): life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 22, life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 23? Let's think.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? Example: if at turn t, life span 1, it disappears after this turn, so can be eaten only on turn t. If life span 2 at turn t, it can be eaten on turn t or t+1, and disappears after turn t+1.\n> \n> Standard: if life span N at turn t, it exists for N turns starting from t, so last chance to eat is on turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> For (6,1): at turn 22, life span 2, so it can be eaten on turn 22 or 23. After turn 23, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1): life span 7 at turn 22, so can be eaten from turn 22 to 28.\n> \n> (4,5): life span 10, turn 22 to 31.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's see where the snake can go.\n> \n> Current head (5,3), direction R.\n> \n> I need to choose an action for turn 22.\n> \n> Options: U, D, R.\n> \n> If I go R to (6,3), that's right to the edge, x=6, which is one before wall at x=7. From (6,3), I can go U, D, or L (but L is left, which might be reverse? Current direction to (6,3) is R, so from (6,3), possible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2), L to (5,3), but (5,3) is where the tail is? After moving, the snake will have moved, so positions change.\n> \n> I need to simulate the movement.\n> \n> Also, food at (6,1) is close, with short life.\n> \n> (6,1) is at x=6,y=1, which is south from (6,3), so D from (6,3) would be to (6,2), then another D to (6,1).\n> \n> But life span 2, so if I go to (6,3) on turn 22, then on turn 23 I can go D to (6,2), but (6,1) is not eaten yet, I need to reach (6,1).\n> \n> From (6,3), I can go directly D to (6,2) on turn 23, then on turn 24 to (6,1), but life span 2 at turn 22 means it disappears after turn 23, so last chance to eat is turn 23.\n> \n> Turn 22: if I move to (6,3), I don't eat food, since no food there.\n> \n> Then turn 23: if I move D to (6,2), still not eating (6,1). (6,1) is at y=1, so from (6,2), I need to move down to (6,1), which would be turn 24. But by turn 24, (6,1) has disappeared, since after turn 23 it's gone.\n> \n> Life span 2 at turn 22: exists on turn 22 and 23, disappears after turn 23. So can be eaten on turn 22 or 23.\n> \n> If I don't eat it on turn 22 or 23, it's gone.\n> \n> Currently at turn 22, head at (5,3). To eat (6,1) on this turn, I need to move directly to it, but (6,1) is not adjacent to (5,3); adjacent cells are (5,4) U, (5,2) D, (6,3) R. (6,1) is not adjacent; it's two steps away.\n> \n> From (5,3), I can move to (6,3) in one step, but (6,3) is not (6,1).\n> \n> Then from (6,3), I can move to (6,2) or (6,1) directly? (6,1) is adjacent to (6,2), not to (6,3). (6,3) to (6,1) is not adjacent; it's two cells down, so I need two moves to reach (6,1) from (5,3): e.g., to (6,3) then to (6,2), then to (6,1), but that would be turn 24 for (6,1), too late.\n> \n> From (5,3), if I go D to (5,2) on turn 22, then from (5,2) I can go R to (6,2) on turn 23, then from (6,2) go D to (6,1) on turn 23? Let's see:\n> \n> Turn 22: move D to (5,2) — but (5,2) has no food.\n> \n> Then turn 23: from (5,2), possible moves: U to (5,3), but (5,3) is where the body is? After turn 22 move, snake positions: head moves to (5,2), so new positions: head (5,2), then previous head (5,3) becomes body, so positions: [(5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)] — tail (1,4) is removed since no food eaten, so length same.\n> \n> After moving to (5,2), the body is (5,3), (4,3), etc.\n> \n> From (5,2), direction is D (since moved down), so cannot move U (up) because reverse, so possible: D to (5,1)? y=1, but y=1 is not wall, since walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is free. Or L to (4,2), or R to (6,2).\n> \n> R to (6,2) is possible.\n> \n> Then on turn 23, move R to (6,2). (6,2) has no food, I think.\n> \n> Then from (6,2), I can move D to (6,1) on turn 24, but again, (6,1) disappears after turn 23, so turn 24 is too late.\n> \n> To eat (6,1) on turn 23, I need to be on a cell adjacent to it on turn 22 end or something.\n> \n> At the start of turn 22, head at (5,3).

So only (6,2) and (5,1) are possible.\n> \n> (7,1) is wall, (6,0) wall, so only (6,2) and (5,1).\n> \n> So to eat (6,1) on turn 23, I need to be at (6,2) or (5,1) at the end of turn 22.\n> \n> Currently at (5,3), end of turn 22 position depends on move.\n> \n> If I move R to (6,3) on turn 22, then at end of turn 22, head at (6,3). (6,3) is not adjacent to (6,1); it's two away. From (6,3), on turn 23 I can move to (6,2), which is adjacent to (6,1), so then on turn 24 I can move to (6,1), but turn 24 is after turn 23, so food gone.\n> \n> Turn 23: if I move to (6,2) on turn 23, I can eat on turn 24?

Positions are given head first: (5,3) is head, then (4,3) is the next segment, which is where the head was before, so since head is at (5,3) and direction is R, it came from left, so previous position was (4,3), which matches.

But internal obstacle at (3,2), which is within this area.\n> \n> So free cells: all (x,y) with 1≤x≤6, 1≤y≤6 except (3,2).\n> \n> Snake occupies: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)\n> \n> Head at (5,3), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,3): since direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L because L would be reverse, which is not allowed since last move was R to here.\n> \n> Movement constraints: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so I cannot move L (left). So possible moves: U (up, to (5,4)), D (down, to (5,2)), R (right, to (6,3)).\n> \n> Now, check if these are safe:\n> \n> - U to (5,4): is this a wall? Walls are at borders, (5,4) is x=5, y=4, both between 1-6, not a wall. Internal obstacle at (3,2), not (5,4). Snake body: positions are (5,3) head, (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4). So (5,4) is not occupied by body? Let's list all body cells: head (5,3), segment 2: (4,3), segment 3: (3,3), segment 4: (3,4), segment 5: (2,4), segment 6: (1,4). So (5,4) is free, not body, not wall. So U to (5,4) is possible.\n> \n> - D to (5,2): (5,2) - x=5, y=2, within 1-6, not wall. Internal obstacle at (3,2), not (5,2). Body: not occupied, since body is at y=3 and y=4 mostly. (5,2) not in positions. So possible.\n> \n> - R to (6,3): (6,3) - x=6, y=3. x=6 is not x=7 or x=0, so not border wall. y=3 fine. Not internal obstacle. Body: not occupied. So possible.\n> \n> Now, food locations:\n> \n> - (6,1): life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 22, life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 23? Let's think.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? Example: if at turn t, life span 1, it disappears after this turn, so can be eaten only on turn t. If life span 2 at turn t, it can be eaten on turn t or t+1, and disappears after turn t+1.\n> \n> Standard: if life span N at turn t, it exists for N turns starting from t, so last chance to eat is on turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> For (6,1): at turn 22, life span 2, so it can be eaten on turn 22 or 23. After turn 23, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1): life span 7 at turn 22, so can be eaten from turn 22 to 28.\n> \n> (4,5): life span 10, turn 22 to 31.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's see where the snake can go.\n> \n> Current head (5,3), direction R.\n> \n> I need to choose an action for turn 22.\n> \n> Options: U, D, R.\n> \n> If I go R to (6,3), that's right to the edge, x=6, which is one before wall at x=7. From (6,3), I can go U, D, or L (but L is left, which might be reverse? Current direction to (6,3) is R, so from (6,3), possible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2), L to (5,3), but (5,3) is where the tail is? After moving, the snake will have moved, so positions change.\n> \n> I need to simulate the movement.\n> \n> Also, food at (6,1) is close, with short life.\n> \n> (6,1) is at x=6,y=1, which is south from (6,3), so D from (6,3) would be to (6,2), then another D to (6,1).\n> \n> But life span 2, so if I go to (6,3) on turn 22, then on turn 23 I can go D to (6,2), but (6,1) is not eaten yet, I need to reach (6,1).\n> \n> From (6,3), I can go directly D to (6,2) on turn 23, then on turn 24 to (6,1), but life span 2 at turn 22 means it disappears after turn 23, so last chance to eat is turn 23.\n> \n> Turn 22: if I move to (6,3), I don't eat food, since no food there.\n> \n> Then turn 23: if I move D to (6,2), still not eating (6,1). (6,1) is at y=1, so from (6,2), I need to move down to (6,1), which would be turn 24. But by turn 24, (6,1) has disappeared, since after turn 23 it's gone.\n> \n> Life span 2 at turn 22: exists on turn 22 and 23, disappears after turn 23. So can be eaten on turn 22 or 23.\n> \n> If I don't eat it on turn 22 or 23, it's gone.\n> \n> Currently at turn 22, head at (5,3). To eat (6,1) on this turn, I need to move directly to it, but (6,1) is not adjacent to (5,3); adjacent cells are (5,4) U, (5,2) D, (6,3) R. (6,1) is not adjacent; it's two steps away.\n> \n> From (5,3), I can move to (6,3) in one step, but (6,3) is not (6,1).\n> \n> Then from (6,3), I can move to (6,2) or (6,1) directly? (6,1) is adjacent to (6,2), not to (6,3). (6,3) to (6,1) is not adjacent; it's two cells down, so I need two moves to reach (6,1) from (5,3): e.g., to (6,3) then to (6,2), then to (6,1), but that would be turn 24 for (6,1), too late.\n> \n> From (5,3), if I go D to (5,2) on turn 22, then from (5,2) I can go R to (6,2) on turn 23, then from (6,2) go D to (6,1) on turn 23? Let's see:\n> \n> Turn 22: move D to (5,2) — but (5,2) has no food.\n> \n> Then turn 23: from (5,2), possible moves: U to (5,3), but (5,3) is where the body is? After turn 22 move, snake positions: head moves to (5,2), so new positions: head (5,2), then previous head (5,3) becomes body, so positions: [(5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)] — tail (1,4) is removed since no food eaten, so length same.\n> \n> After moving to (5,2), the body is (5,3), (4,3), etc.\n> \n> From (5,2), direction is D (since moved down), so cannot move U (up) because reverse, so possible: D to (5,1)? y=1, but y=1 is not wall, since walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is free. Or L to (4,2), or R to (6,2).\n> \n> R to (6,2) is possible.\n> \n> Then on turn 23, move R to (6,2). (6,2) has no food, I think.\n> \n> Then from (6,2), I can move D to (6,1) on turn 24, but again, (6,1) disappears after turn 23, so turn 24 is too late.\n> \n> To eat (6,1) on turn 23, I need to be on a cell adjacent to it on turn 22 end or something.\n> \n> At the start of turn 22, head at (5,3). To eat on turn 22, I need to move to a food cell, but (6,1) is not adjacent, so impossible to eat on turn 22.\n> \n> To eat on turn 23, I need to be on a cell adjacent to (6,1) at the end of turn 22, so that on turn 23 I can move to (6,1).\n> \n> Adjacent cells to (6,1) are: (6,2) above, (5,1) left, (7,1) right but x=7 wall, (6,0) down but y=0 wall. So only (6,2) and (5,1) are possible.\n> \n> (7,1) is wall, (6,0) wall, so only (6,2) and (5,1).\n> \n> So to eat (6,1) on turn 23, I need to be at (6,2) or (5,1) at the end of turn 22.\n> \n> Currently at (5,3), end of turn 22 position depends on move.\n> \n> If I move R to (6,3) on turn 22, then at end of turn 22, head at (6,3). (6,3) is not adjacent to (6,1); it's two away. From (6,3), on turn 23 I can move to (6,2), which is adjacent to (6,1), so then on turn 24 I can move to (6,1), but turn 24 is after turn 23, so food gone.\n> \n> Turn 23: if I move to (6,2) on turn 23, I can eat on turn 24? No.\n> \n> Eating happens when head moves to food cell.\n> \n> So for (6,1), to eat on turn t, I need to move to (6,1) on turn t.\n> \n> To move to (6,1) on turn t, I need to be adjacent at turn t-1.\n> \n> At turn 21, head was at (4,3), moved R to (5,3) on turn 22? Turn 22 is current turn, we are deciding action for turn 22.\n> \n> At start of turn 22, head at (5,3).\n> \n> After action, head moves to new position.\n> \n> If on turn 22 I move to a position, that's the end state for turn 22.\n> \n> Then on turn 23, I move from there.\n> \n> To eat (6,1) on turn 23, I need to move to (6,1) on turn 23, which requires that at the end of turn 22, I am at a cell adjacent to (6,1), i.e., (6,2) or (5,1).\n> \n> Similarly, for turn 22, to eat on turn 22, I need to move to (6,1) now, but I can't from (5,3).\n> \n> So it's impossible to eat (6,1) on turn 22 or 23 from current position, because I can't reach an adjacent cell in one move to be in position for turn 23 eat.\n> \n> From (5,3), in one move, I can go to (5,4), (5,2), or (6,3).\n> \n> None of these are (6,2) or (5,1), so I cannot be at (6,2) or (5,1) at end of turn 22.\n> \n> (5,2) is adjacent to (5,1), but (5,1) is not (6,1), and (5,2) is not adjacent to (6,1).\n> \n> (6,1) adjacent cells are (6,2) and (5,1), as above.\n> \n> From (5,3), moving to (5,2) gets me to (5,2), which is not adjacent to (6,1); distance is |6-5| + |1-2| =1+1=2, not adjacent.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) to (6,1) is not adjacent.\n> \n> So I cannot reach a position to eat (6,1) on turn 23; the earliest I could reach it is turn 24, but by then it's gone.\n> \n> Therefore, (6,1) is impossible to eat; it will disappear without being eaten. So I should ignore it.\n> \n> Life span 2 at turn 22, last eat on turn 23, but I can't reach it by turn 23, so yes, impossible.

From (6,3), I can go U to (6,4), D to (6,2), or L to (5,3). But (5,3) will be the body after move, so moving L to (5,3) would be body collision, but since the tail is moving, let's see.\n> \n> After moving to (6,3) on turn 22, snake positions: head (6,3), then (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4) — tail (1,4) is removed, so positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)]\n> \n> Now, from (6,3), on turn 23, possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (6,4): free?

After the move, the head moves to (4,3), but since the body segment was there, and it's not the tail, it would cause a collision because the body doesn't move away instantly? No.\n> \n> When the snake moves:\n> \n> - Head moves to new position.\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> - The tail segment is removed, and if food is eaten, a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> Specifically, when you move:\n> \n> - New head position based on direction.\n> \n> - Body segments shift: segment 1 moves to where head was, segment 2 to where segment 1 was, and so on.\n> \n> - If food not eaten, tail is removed.

So if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment, and that segment is not the tail, after the shift, that segment will move to the new head position, causing collision.\n> \n> Only if head moves to the current tail position, and the tail moves away, it might be safe.\n> \n> Here, (4,3) is not the tail; tail is (3,4).

Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left last turn.\n> \n> Food: two pieces:\n> \n> - (3,1) with life span 6 and value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (4,5) with life span 8 and value +1 (also positive food)\n> \n> Both foods have value +1, so they're both positive. No negative food here.\n> \n> I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 24. So, turns 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and possibly beyond, but at least 5 turns.\n> \n> The goal is to maximize score by eating food while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> Key constraints:\n> \n> - Cannot move opposite to current direction. Since head direction is L, I cannot move right (R) on the next turn (turn 24). So possible moves from (4,4) are U, D, L. R is invalid because it's opposite to L.\n> \n> Current head at (4,4), direction L. So from (4,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up (U): (x,y+1) = (4,5)\n> \n> - Down (D): (x,y-1) = (4,3)\n> \n> - Left (L): (x-1,y) = (3,4)\n> \n> - Right (R): (x+1,y) = (5,4) but this is opposite to current direction L, so not allowed.\n> \n> Now, check if these cells are safe:\n> \n> - (4,5): is this a wall? Walls: border at y=7 and y=0, x=0,x=7. (4,5) is within bounds, y=5 <7, x=4 between 0 and 7. Internal obstacle at (3,2), so (4,5) is clear. But is it occupied by snake body?\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)\n> \n> (4,5) is not in this list, so it's empty. But there is food at (4,5), with value +1 and life span 8.\n> \n> - (4,3): this is a body segment? Snake has (4,3) which is the fourth segment. Moving to (4,3) would be a body collision, except if it's the tail and we can move there if the tail moves.\n> \n> Let's see: if I move to (4,3), the head would be at (4,3), but that cell is currently occupied by the body. However, since the tail will move, if (4,3) is the tail, it might be ok.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (4,4), then (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4). So the tail is at (3,4).\n> \n> (4,3) is the fourth position, not the tail. Tail is (3,4).\n> \n> If I move head to (4,3), that cell is currently occupied by the body segment at (4,3). After the move, the head moves to (4,3), but since the body segment was there, and it's not the tail, it would cause a collision because the body doesn't move away instantly? No.\n> \n> When the snake moves:\n> \n> - Head moves to new position.\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> - The tail segment is removed, and if food is eaten, a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> Specifically, when you move:\n> \n> - New head position based on direction.\n> \n> - Body segments shift: segment 1 moves to where head was, segment 2 to where segment 1 was, and so on.\n> \n> - If food not eaten, tail is removed. If food eaten, tail stays and new segment added, so snake grows.\n> \n> Collision: head collides with any body segment except that if head moves to where the tail was, it might be ok if the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (4,3), which is currently occupied by a body segment (not the tail), after the move, that body segment will move to (5,4) or something? Let's simulate.\n> \n> Current positions:\n> \n> Index: 0: head (4,4)\n> \n> 1: (5,4)\n> \n> 2: (5,3)\n> \n> 3: (4,3)\n> \n> 4: (3,3)\n> \n> 5: tail (3,4)\n> \n> If I move down to (4,3):\n> \n> - New head position: (4,3)\n> \n> But (4,3) is currently occupied by segment 3.\n> \n> After head moves to (4,3), the body segments shift:\n> \n> - Segment 1 moves to previous head position (4,4)\n> \n> - Segment 2 moves to previous segment 1 position (5,4)\n> \n> - Segment 3 moves to previous segment 2 position (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 4 moves to previous segment 3 position (4,3) — but (4,3) is now the head, so segment 4 would move to (4,3), which is the head position, causing collision.\n> \n> Exactly. So if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment, and that segment is not the tail, after the shift, that segment will move to the new head position, causing collision.\n> \n> Only if head moves to the current tail position, and the tail moves away, it might be safe.\n> \n> Here, (4,3) is not the tail; tail is (3,4). So moving to (4,3) would cause collision with body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left to (3,4): (3,4) is the tail position.\n> \n> If I move to (3,4):\n> \n> - New head at (3,4)\n> \n> - Tail was at (3,4), but it will move away because the snake moves.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - Head moves to (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 1 moves to (4,4)\n> \n> - Segment 2 moves to (5,4)\n> \n> - Segment 3 moves to (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 4 moves to (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 5 (tail) moves to (3,3) — previous position of segment 4.\n> \n> Since head moved to (3,4), which was the tail, and tail moves to (3,3), so no collision, because the cell is vacated.\n> \n> But (3,4) was the tail, so it should be safe.\n> \n> Now, if I move up to (4,5): (4,5) is empty, no body there.\n> \n> Also, (4,5) has food with value +1 and life span 8.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 24, food at (4,5) has life span 8, meaning it will disappear after 8 more turns, so at turn 32? Life span decreases each turn, starting from now.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 24, food at (4,5) has life span 8, so it will be there for 8 turns, from turn 24 to 31 inclusive? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, then at turn t, food with life span L will disappear after L turns, meaning it is present from turn t to turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> For example, if L=1 at turn t, it disappears after this turn, so you can eat it only on turn t.\n> \n> If L=2, present at t and t+1, disappear after t+1.\n> \n> Similarly, here at turn 24:\n> \n> Food at (3,1) life span 6: present from turn 24 to 24+6-1=29, so turns 24,25,26,27,28,29. Disappears after turn 29.\n> \n> Food at (4,5) life span 8: present from 24 to 31, disappears after 31.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves from (4,4) at turn 24:\n> \n> - U: to (4,5) - empty, has food\n> \n> - D: to (4,3) - currently body segment, not tail, so collision if moved there\n> \n> - L: to (3,4) - currently tail, so should be safe\n> \n> - R: invalid, opposite direction\n> \n> So only U and L are safe moves. D is unsafe, causes collision.\n> \n> Therefore, for turn 24, possible actions: U or L.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> First, let's consider eating the food at (4,5). It's close, and we can eat it now by moving up.\n> \n> If I move U to (4,5) at turn 24:\n> \n> - Head moves to (4,5), eats food (since there is food), so snake grows.\n> \n> New snake: head at (4,5), then previous head (4,4) becomes segment 1, and so on, tail remains, and a new segment is added at the tail position? Standard snake growth: when food eaten, tail doesn't move, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> - Head moves to new position, if food, it is eaten.\n> \n> - Then, if food eaten, the tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the tail position, effectively the snake grows by one.\n> \n> - If no food, tail is removed.\n> \n> In this case, move U to (4,5): food eaten, so:\n> \n> - New positions: head at (4,5)\n> \n> - Then, the body: segment 1 at (4,4) (previous head)\n> \n> Segment 2 at (5,4) (previous seg1)\n> \n> Segment 3 at (5,3) (previous seg2)\n> \n> Segment 4 at (4,3) (previous seg3)\n> \n> Segment 5 at (3,3) (previous seg4)\n> \n> And since food eaten, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, which was (3,4), but the tail was (3,4), and it doesn't move, so new segment at (3,4).\n> \n> Previous tail position: before move, tail was at (3,4). After head moves and food eaten, the tail stays, so new segment at (3,4), and the previous segments shift.\n> \n> So new snake: head (4,5), then (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), and new tail at (3,4)? Let's list:\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - Head: (4,5)\n> \n> - Seg1: old head (4,4)\n> \n> - Seg2: old seg1 (5,4)\n> \n> - Seg3: old seg2 (5,3)\n> \n> - Seg4: old seg3 (4,3)\n> \n> - Seg5: old seg4 (3,3)\n> \n> - And since food eaten, new segment at old tail position (3,4), so now tail is at (3,4).\n> \n> Positions: [(4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)]\n> \n> Length increased to 7.\n> \n> Head direction now U, since we moved up.\n> \n> Food at (4,5) is eaten, so removed.\n> \n> Food at (3,1) still there with life span 6, but now at turn 24, after eating, life span decreases to 5 for the next turn? Life span decreases every turn, including when food is not eaten.\n> \n> At the start of turn 24, food has life span as given. After the turn, when we process, life span decreases.\n> \n> But for the food, countdown happens regardless of eating.\n> \n> In this case, after turn 24, if we eat (4,5), it's gone. Food at (3,1) life span decreases to 5 for turn 25.\n> \n> Now, after this move, head at (4,5), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves from there: since direction U, cannot move D (opposite), so possible U, L, R.\n> \n> Cells around:\n> \n> - U: (4,6) - within bounds, y=6<7, no wall, check if body.

It's turn 26, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think.

So the snake is a bit coiled up.\n> \n> Head direction is Down, meaning it was moving down to (3,3) from the previous position. The positions are given in order: head first, so from (3,3) to (3,4), which is up? Let's list them:\n> \n> - Head: (3,3)\n> \n> - Next: (3,4) — that's one step up in y, so from (3,3) to (3,4) is moving up? But the head direction is given as D, which is down. Inconsistency?\n> \n> Coordinates: (x,y). Moving Up increases y? The movement definitions: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So y increases upward or downward?\n> \n> Typically in grids, y=0 might be top or bottom. But here, walls are y=0 and y=7, so let's assume y=0 is bottom or top? Movement: U (x,y+1) — if y+1, and walls at y=0 and y=7, probably y=0 is the bottom, so U (up) increases y, moving to higher y, which might be north if we think of the grid.\n> \n> But let's see the snake positions: head at (3,3), next segment at (3,4). Since positions are head first, the head is at (3,3), and the next part is (3,4), which means the snake was moving from (3,4) to (3,3)? That would be down, since y decreased from 4 to 3? y=4 to y=3 is decreasing y, which is down, D.\n> \n> But the head direction is given as D, which is down, so at turn 26, the head is at (3,3), and it just moved down to there, I assume from (3,4) in the previous turn? But the positions are listed as [(3,3), (3,4), ...], so (3,3) is head, (3,4) is the first body segment, meaning the head was at (3,4) before moving to (3,3). So moving from (3,4) to (3,3) is down, decreasing y, so direction D is consistent.\n> \n> Now, the food:\n> \n> - (3,1) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,5) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,1) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (3,1), life span 4 at turn 26, so it disappears after 4 turns, meaning it will be gone after turn 29? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 26, life span 4, after turn 26 it becomes 3, then turn 27:2, turn 28:1, turn 29:0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 26 to 28, I think. Life span N means it disappears after N turns, so if life span is S at turn t, it will be present until turn t + S - 1, and disappear at turn t + S.\n> \n> The rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is N, after the turn, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until N=0, it disappears. So for food at (3,1), life span 4 at turn 26, after turn 26, life span becomes 3; after turn 27, life span 2; after turn 28, life span 1; after turn 29, life span 0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 26,27,28,29? But on turn 29, if eaten, life span is 1 before eating, I think.\n> \n> The eating happens when the head moves onto the food cell during the turn. So for a food with life span N at turn t, it can be eaten on turn t if head moves there, and after eating, it's gone. If not eaten, life span decreases to N-1 at the start of next turn, and so on.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable area x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (3,3)\n> \n> - Body: (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)\n> \n> So let's plot this:\n> \n> y=6: ...\n> \n> y=5: ...\n> \n> y=4: (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)\n> \n> y=3: (3,3) head, (5,3), (4,3) — (4,3) is the tail, I think.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: (3,3) head, 1: (3,4), 2: (4,4), 3: (5,4), 4: (5,3), 5: (4,3)\n> \n> So tail is at (4,3).\n> \n> Now, head at (3,3), moving down? Direction is D, down, which is (x,y-1). But since it just moved to (3,3) by going down, from (3,4), so current direction is down.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,3):\n> \n> - U: (3,4) — but (3,4) is occupied by body segment, so collision if move there.\n> \n> - D: (3,2) — but (3,2) is an internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - L: (2,3) — is this free? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n> \n> Occupied cells: snake positions: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)\n> \n> Walls: borders and (3,2)\n> \n> So (2,3): x=2,y=3, which is within 1-6, and not occupied by snake or wall, so free.\n> \n> R: (4,3) — (4,3) is occupied by the tail, but moving into tail is allowed only if the tail moves away, so it might be safe.\n> \n> Rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

Positions: let's list the segments:\n> \n> Segments: 0: head (3,3)\n> \n> 1: (3,4)\n> \n> 2: (4,4)\n> \n> 3: (5,4)\n> \n> 4: (5,3)\n> \n> 5: tail (4,3)\n> \n> If head moves to (4,3), which is segment 5, tail position.\n> \n> After move, if no food eaten, head moves to (4,3), and tail moves away to segment 4's previous position? Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, if no food, tail is removed, so the cell is free.\n> \n> Specifically: head moves to new position. If new position not food, then tail is removed (the last segment is popped), so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> Therefore, if head moves to the current tail position, and it's not food, then after the move, the head is at that cell, and the tail segment is gone, so no collision because the tail moved.\n> \n> If it is food, then the tail doesn't move, and snake grows, so if head moves to tail cell and it has food, it would cause collision because the tail doesn't move, and head occupies the same cell? But the rule has a special case.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> But here, the head is at (3,3), tail at (4,3), so they are adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> Now, is there food at tail? The food positions are at (3,1), (4,5), (2,1), not at (4,3), so no food at tail cell.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (4,3) should be safe, since no food there, so tail will move away.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (2,3) should be safe.\n> \n> But from (3,3), possible moves:\n> \n> U: (3,4) - occupied by body segment 1, so collision, death.

So can be eaten on turns 26,27,28,29? On turn 29, if head moves to it, life span is 1 before move, so can be eaten, then after eating, it's gone.

It's turn 26, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,3), then body segments: (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3).

The positions are given in order: head first, so from (3,3) to (3,4), which is up? Let's list them:\n> \n> - Head: (3,3)\n> \n> - Next: (3,4) — that's one step up in y, so from (3,3) to (3,4) is moving up? But the head direction is given as D, which is down. Inconsistency?\n> \n> Coordinates: (x,y). Moving Up increases y? The movement definitions: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So y increases upward or downward?\n> \n> Typically in grids, y=0 might be top or bottom. But here, walls are y=0 and y=7, so let's assume y=0 is bottom or top? Movement: U (x,y+1) — if y+1, and walls at y=0 and y=7, probably y=0 is the bottom, so U (up) increases y, moving to higher y, which might be north if we think of the grid.\n> \n> But let's see the snake positions: head at (3,3), next segment at (3,4). Since positions are head first, the head is at (3,3), and the next part is (3,4), which means the snake was moving from (3,4) to (3,3)? That would be down, since y decreased from 4 to 3? y=4 to y=3 is decreasing y, which is down, D.\n> \n> But the head direction is given as D, which is down, so at turn 26, the head is at (3,3), and it just moved down to there, I assume from (3,4) in the previous turn? But the positions are listed as [(3,3), (3,4), ...], so (3,3) is head, (3,4) is the first body segment, meaning the head was at (3,4) before moving to (3,3). So moving from (3,4) to (3,3) is down, decreasing y, so direction D is consistent.\n> \n> Now, the food:\n> \n> - (3,1) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,5) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,1) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (3,1), life span 4 at turn 26, so it disappears after 4 turns, meaning it will be gone after turn 29? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 26, life span 4, after turn 26 it becomes 3, then turn 27:2, turn 28:1, turn 29:0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 26 to 28, I think. Life span N means it disappears after N turns, so if life span is S at turn t, it will be present until turn t + S - 1, and disappear at turn t + S.\n> \n> The rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is N, after the turn, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until N=0, it disappears. So for food at (3,1), life span 4 at turn 26, after turn 26, life span becomes 3; after turn 27, life span 2; after turn 28, life span 1; after turn 29, life span 0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 26,27,28,29? But on turn 29, if eaten, life span is 1 before eating, I think.\n> \n> The eating happens when the head moves onto the food cell during the turn. So for a food with life span N at turn t, it can be eaten on turn t if head moves there, and after eating, it's gone. If not eaten, life span decreases to N-1 at the start of next turn, and so on.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable area x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (3,3)\n> \n> - Body: (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)\n> \n> So let's plot this:\n> \n> y=6: ...\n> \n> y=5: ...\n> \n> y=4: (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)\n> \n> y=3: (3,3) head, (5,3), (4,3) — (4,3) is the tail, I think.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: (3,3) head, 1: (3,4), 2: (4,4), 3: (5,4), 4: (5,3), 5: (4,3)\n> \n> So tail is at (4,3).\n> \n> Now, head at (3,3), moving down? Direction is D, down, which is (x,y-1). But since it just moved to (3,3) by going down, from (3,4), so current direction is down.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,3):\n> \n> - U: (3,4) — but (3,4) is occupied by body segment, so collision if move there.\n> \n> - D: (3,2) — but (3,2) is an internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - L: (2,3) — is this free? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n> \n> Occupied cells: snake positions: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)\n> \n> Walls: borders and (3,2)\n> \n> So (2,3): x=2,y=3, which is within 1-6, and not occupied by snake or wall, so free.\n> \n> R: (4,3) — (4,3) is occupied by the tail, but moving into tail is allowed only if the tail moves away, so it might be safe.\n> \n> Rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to (4,3) might be safe if the tail moves.\n> \n> Current tail is (4,3), and if head moves to (4,3), then after move, the snake grows if it eats food, but here no food at (4,3), so if head moves to (4,3), and tail moves away, it should be ok, but let's see the sequence.\n> \n> When head moves to a cell, if it's not food, the tail moves, so the cell is vacated.\n> \n> Specifically for tail: if head moves to the tail position, and it's not food, then since the tail moves, the head doesn't collide with it; the head occupies the cell, tail moves to next.\n> \n> But in this case, (4,3) is the tail, so if head moves right to (4,3), and (4,3) is not food, then after moving, head is at (4,3), and the tail was at (4,3) but moves to the next segment, which is (5,3)? Positions: let's list the segments:\n> \n> Segments: 0: head (3,3)\n> \n> 1: (3,4)\n> \n> 2: (4,4)\n> \n> 3: (5,4)\n> \n> 4: (5,3)\n> \n> 5: tail (4,3)\n> \n> If head moves to (4,3), which is segment 5, tail position.\n> \n> After move, if no food eaten, head moves to (4,3), and tail moves away to segment 4's previous position? Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, if no food, tail is removed, so the cell is free.\n> \n> Specifically: head moves to new position. If new position not food, then tail is removed (the last segment is popped), so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> Therefore, if head moves to the current tail position, and it's not food, then after the move, the head is at that cell, and the tail segment is gone, so no collision because the tail moved.\n> \n> If it is food, then the tail doesn't move, and snake grows, so if head moves to tail cell and it has food, it would cause collision because the tail doesn't move, and head occupies the same cell? But the rule has a special case.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> But here, the head is at (3,3), tail at (4,3), so they are adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> Now, is there food at tail? The food positions are at (3,1), (4,5), (2,1), not at (4,3), so no food at tail cell.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (4,3) should be safe, since no food there, so tail will move away.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (2,3) should be safe.\n> \n> But from (3,3), possible moves:\n> \n> U: (3,4) - occupied by body segment 1, so collision, death.

At turn 29, if life span was 1, it can be eaten before disappearing.\n> \n> Life span 4 at turn 26: after turn 26, life span 3; turn 27:2; turn 28:1; turn 29:0, disappears. So can be eaten on turns 26,27,28,29? On turn 29, if head moves to it, life span is 1 before move, so can be eaten, then after eating, it's gone. Similarly, disappears after turn 29, meaning not available on turn 30.\n> \n> But since we start from turn 26, we can eat it on turn 26,27,28, or 29.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5): life span 6, at turn 26, so can be eaten until turn 31 (since 26+6-1=31?

D and R are invalid.\n> \n> D is to (2,3), which is body, so collision.\n> \n> R is to (3,2), wall.\n> \n> So only U or L are possible.\n> \n> Now, U is to (2,1), which has food. L is to (1,2), which has no food mentioned, so empty.\n> \n> But food at (2,1) is positive, and eating it would increase length.\n> \n> However, there's a rule about Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Let's check the tail position.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,4).\n> \n> Head is at (2,2), which is not adjacent to (5,4). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (2,2) to (5,4) is not adjacent; it's far away.\n> \n> So no issue with that for (2,1).\n> \n> Now, if I move to (2,1), I eat the food, snake grows to 7 segments. New head at (2,1), and the tail stays or moves? When you eat, the tail doesn't move that turn, so length increases.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, you move to the food cell, and the tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions: if head moves to food, it stays there, and the body follows, but since tail doesn't move, the new position list will have the new head at (2,1), then previous head (2,2) becomes body, then (2,3), (3,3), etc., up to (5,4), so now 7 segments.\n> \n> But I need to think about future moves.\n> \n> Also, food at (2,1) has life span 7, but on this turn, it decreases to 6 after this turn? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Turn t1=28, if I move to (2,1) on turn 28, I eat it, so it's consumed, no problem.\n> \n> If I don't eat it, after turn 28, life span becomes 1? Let's see the life span.\n> \n> Food at (2,1) has life span 7 at turn 28. Since it decreases on turn 28, after turn 28, life span becomes 6. Then after turn 29, 5, and so on, disappears after turn 34.\n> \n> But if I eat it on turn 28, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, back to moves: from (2,2), I can only go U or L.\n> \n> Option 1: U to (2,1) - eat food, grow to 7 segments.\n> \n> Option 2: L to (1,2) - no food, just move.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there are other foods: (3,1), (4,5), (1,5)\n> \n> (3,1) has life span 2, so after turn 28, it becomes 1, so it disappears after turn 29 if not eaten. Meaning, if not eaten by turn 29, it's gone.\n> \n> Turn t1=28, food life span decreases on each turn including when the snake acts.\n> \n> Typically, the sequence: on turn t, snake moves, then food life span decreases, and if life span reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Let's interpret.\n> \n> For food with life span L at turn t, it means it will disappear after t + L - 1 or something? Need to be careful.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, with life span L, after the turn, countdown decreases by 1, so new life span L-1. It disappears when life span reaches 0.\n> \n> For example, (3,1) life span 2 at turn 28: after turn 28, life span becomes 1. After turn 29, life span becomes 0, and it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 28 or 29, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) life span 4: after turn 28:3, turn 29:2, turn 30:1, turn 31:0 disappear.

So (2,2) is now a body segment, so moving to (2,2) would cause collision.\n> \n> - L: (1,1) - x=1,y=1, not wall, not occupied? Currently snake at (2,1),(2,2),etc., so (1,1) free?

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State (Turn \\( t_0 = 29 \\))\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state based on the given information:\n\n- **Grid Dimensions and Walls**: \n  - The grid is 8x8 (coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n  - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n  - Internal obstacle at (3,2).\n\n- **Snake**:\n  - Positions: [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)] (head at (2,1), tail at (5,4)).\n  - Current head direction: Down (D). This means the snake was moving downward to reach (2,1) from (2,2) in the previous move.\n\n- **Food**:\n  1. (3,1): value = +1, life_span = 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten).\n  2. (4,5): value = +1, life_span = 3.\n  3. (1,5): value = +1, life_span = 9.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (2,1) with Direction D\n\nFrom the head at (2,1) moving Down (D), the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (2,0) \n   - y=0 is a border wall → Invalid.\n2. **Down (D)**: (2,2)\n   - (2,2) is the second segment of the snake's body → Collision → Invalid.\n3. **Left (L)**: (1,1)\n   - Check:\n     - Not a wall: x=1,y=1 is within bounds and not listed as a wall.\n     - Not occupied by snake: Current snake positions are from (2,1) to (5,4); (1,1) is free.\n     - No food at (1,1) in the given list.\n   - Valid move.\n4. **Right (R)**: (3,1)\n   - Check:\n     - Not a wall: x=3,y=1 is within bounds; internal wall is at (3,2), not (3,1).\n     - Not occupied by snake: (3,1) is not in the snake's current positions.\n     - Food present: (3,1) has positive food with life_span = 1.\n   - Valid move.\n\n**Valid Immediate Moves**: Left (L) to (1,1) or Right (R) to (3,1).\n\n### Evaluating the Moves\n\n1. **Move Right (R) to (3,1)**:\n   - **Pros**:\n     - Eats positive food at (3,1) before it disappears after this turn.\n     - Increases snake length by 1 (new length = 8).\n   - **Cons**:\n     - After moving to (3,1), the next moves might be limited:\n       - From (3,1), direction is Right (R).\n       - Possible next moves:\n         - Up (U): (3,0) → wall (y=0) → invalid.\n         - Down (D): (3,2) → internal wall → invalid.\n         - Left (L): (2,1) → body segment → invalid.\n         - Right (R): (4,1) → free.\n       - Only possible move is Right to (4,1), which may lead to being boxed in with limited future options.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (1,1)**:\n   - **Pros**:\n     - Keeps the snake length the same (no growth).\n     - Opens up space to potentially reach other foods like (1,5) in the future.\n   - **Cons**:\n     - Misses the opportunity to eat the food at (3,1), which will disappear after this turn.\n\n### Considering the Previous Plan (from Turn 28)\n\nThe previous plan at Turn 28 suggested:\n- Turn 28: U (to (2,1)) — already executed.\n- Turn 29: R (to (3,1)) — current turn is 29, so this suggests moving Right to (3,1).\n\nThe reasoning was to prioritize eating the expiring food at (3,1) and then move downward for long-term survival.\n\n### Potential Issues with Following the Previous Plan\n\n- After moving to (3,1), the only immediate next move is Right to (4,1), which may not be optimal for reaching other foods like (1,5) or (4,5).\n- The food at (4,5) has a life_span of 3, meaning it will disappear after Turn 31. From (4,1), reaching (4,5) by Turn 31 is impossible (requires at least 4 moves: (4,1)→(4,2)→(4,3)→(4,4)→(4,5)), but Turn 31 is only 2 moves away from Turn 29.\n\n### Alternative Approach: Move Left to (1,1)\n\n- By moving Left to (1,1), we can start heading towards (1,5), which has a long life_span (9 turns).\n- Future moves could be:\n  - From (1,1), possible moves:\n    - Up (U): (1,0) → wall → invalid.\n    - Down (D): (1,2) → free.\n    - Left (L): (0,1) → wall → invalid.\n    - Right (R): (2,1) → body → invalid.\n    - Only Down to (1,2).\n  - Then from (1,2), can go Down to (1,3), and so on, eventually reaching (1,5).\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that the food at (3,1) is about to disappear and is positive, it's beneficial to eat it to maximize the score. Even though it may limit immediate future moves, the score gain is valuable. The previous plan's reasoning aligns with this, and the potential limitation in movement can be managed by carefully choosing subsequent moves to avoid dead ends.\n\n### Immediate Action\n\nAt Turn 29, the best immediate action is to follow the previous plan and move Right (R) to (3,1) to eat the food before it disappears.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Also, an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> - Snake positions: Head at (2,2), then body segments at (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4). So the snake has 6 segments.

That means from (2,2), moving down would go to (2,1), but (2,1) has food. Let's see the grid layout.\n> \n> I should sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid is from x=0 to x=7, y=0 to y=7.

Positions: head at (2,2), next body at (2,3), which is directly below? (2,3) is at same x, y=3, so higher y is down? Typically in grids, y=0 is top, y=7 is bottom, so increasing y is downward.\n> \n> Confirm: head at (2,2), body at (2,3). Since y=3 > y=2, that means (2,3) is below (2,2), so snake was moving down to (2,3)? No.\n> \n> Snake positions list: [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3), ...] so head is first, then the body segments in order. So from head to tail: (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (5,4)\n> \n> The head is at (2,2), and the next segment is at (2,3), which is directly below it (since y=3 > y=2, assuming y increases downward). But head direction is given as D, which is down. So if head is moving down, from previous position to current.\n> \n> Perhaps I need to think about the movement.\n> \n> Head direction is D, meaning it is currently facing down, so on the next move, it can go down, left, or right, but not up (since reverse is not allowed instantly).\n> \n> Current head position: (2,2)\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,2):\n> \n> - Up (U): (2,1) — but y=1, which is up if y=0 top.\n> \n> - Down (D): (2,3) — but (2,3) is occupied by the body! (2,3) is the first body segment.\n> \n> - Left (L): (1,2)\n> \n> - Right (R): (3,2) — but (3,2) is an internal obstacle?

Currently, no snake or obstacle? Snake positions: (2,2) head, (2,3) body, (3,3), etc. (2,1) is not occupied, and it has food? Food at (2,1) is present.\n> \n> (2,1) has food with life span 7.\n> \n> - D: (2,3) — but (2,3) is occupied by the snake body.

No internal obstacle mentioned, so should be free.\n> \n> - R: (3,2) — but (3,2) is an internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> So possible moves: U or L. D and R are invalid.\n> \n> D is to (2,3), which is body, so collision.\n> \n> R is to (3,2), wall.\n> \n> So only U or L are possible.\n> \n> Now, U is to (2,1), which has food. L is to (1,2), which has no food mentioned, so empty.\n> \n> But food at (2,1) is positive, and eating it would increase length.\n> \n> However, there's a rule about Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Let's check the tail position.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,4).\n> \n> Head is at (2,2), which is not adjacent to (5,4). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (2,2) to (5,4) is not adjacent; it's far away.\n> \n> So no issue with that for (2,1).\n> \n> Now, if I move to (2,1), I eat the food, snake grows to 7 segments. New head at (2,1), and the tail stays or moves? When you eat, the tail doesn't move that turn, so length increases.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, you move to the food cell, and the tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions: if head moves to food, it stays there, and the body follows, but since tail doesn't move, the new position list will have the new head at (2,1), then previous head (2,2) becomes body, then (2,3), (3,3), etc., up to (5,4), so now 7 segments.\n> \n> But I need to think about future moves.\n> \n> Also, food at (2,1) has life span 7, but on this turn, it decreases to 6 after this turn? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Turn t1=28, if I move to (2,1) on turn 28, I eat it, so it's consumed, no problem.\n> \n> If I don't eat it, after turn 28, life span becomes 1? Let's see the life span.\n> \n> Food at (2,1) has life span 7 at turn 28. Since it decreases on turn 28, after turn 28, life span becomes 6. Then after turn 29, 5, and so on, disappears after turn 34.\n> \n> But if I eat it on turn 28, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, back to moves: from (2,2), I can only go U or L.\n> \n> Option 1: U to (2,1) - eat food, grow to 7 segments.\n> \n> Option 2: L to (1,2) - no food, just move.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there are other foods: (3,1), (4,5), (1,5)\n> \n> (3,1) has life span 2, so after turn 28, it becomes 1, so it disappears after turn 29 if not eaten. Meaning, if not eaten by turn 29, it's gone.\n> \n> Turn t1=28, food life span decreases on each turn including when the snake acts.\n> \n> Typically, the sequence: on turn t, snake moves, then food life span decreases, and if life span reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Let's interpret.\n> \n> For food with life span L at turn t, it means it will disappear after t + L - 1 or something? Need to be careful.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, with life span L, after the turn, countdown decreases by 1, so new life span L-1. It disappears when life span reaches 0.\n> \n> For example, (3,1) life span 2 at turn 28: after turn 28, life span becomes 1. After turn 29, life span becomes 0, and it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 28 or 29, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) life span 4: after turn 28:3, turn 29:2, turn 30:1, turn 31:0 disappear. Can be eaten up to turn 31.\n> \n> (2,1) life span 7: after turn 28:6, ..., disappear after turn 34.\n> \n> (1,5) life span 10: disappear after turn 37.\n> \n> Now, back to immediate move.\n> \n> If I go U to (2,1), I eat the food, snake grows, head now at (2,1).\n> \n> From there, possible moves: since I moved up, previous direction was down, but now head is at (2,1), and I just moved up, so current direction is U? Direction changes with move.\n> \n> Snake head direction is given as D, but after I move, the direction updates.\n> \n> After moving U to (2,1), head direction becomes U.\n> \n> Then possible moves from (2,1): U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But cannot reverse, so since I just moved U, I cannot move D (down) next turn.\n> \n> Also, check surroundings:\n> \n> - U: (2,0) - but y=0 is wall (border), so invalid\n> \n> - D: (2,2) - now, after move, the body: after eating, positions: head at (2,1), then (2,2) (previous head), then (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4). So (2,2) is now a body segment, so moving to (2,2) would cause collision.\n> \n> - L: (1,1) - x=1,y=1, not wall, not occupied? Currently snake at (2,1),(2,2),etc., so (1,1) free? No food mentioned.\n> \n> - R: (3,1) - (3,1) has food! And it's within bounds, not wall.\n> \n> (3,1) has life span 2 at turn 28, so on turn 28, if I don't eat it, after turn 28, life span 1.\n> \n> But I'm moving on turn 28 to (2,1), so on turn 28, I eat (2,1) food.\n> \n> Then on turn 29, I can move from (2,1).\n> \n> From (2,1), moves:\n> \n> - U: wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (2,2) body, collision, invalid\n> \n> - L: (1,1) - free, I think\n> \n> - R: (3,1) - has food, and not occupied by snake yet.\n> \n> (3,1) is not in snake positions, so can move there.\n> \n> But (3,1) has an internal obstacle?

It's turn 30. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls are on the edges. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,1), then body segments: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4). So the snake has 8 segments.

Life span 2 means it disappears after 2 turns, including the current turn. So if not eaten by turn 31, it might disappear? Let's see: life span decreases every turn, including current. At turn 30, life span is 2, so after turn 30, it becomes 1, and after turn 31, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 30 or 31.\n> \n> - (1,5) with value 1 and life span 8. Value 1 is positive food, so both are positive food since value is 1 for both.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for the next 5+ turns to maximize score while avoiding risks. I should think about possible moves and their consequences.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. I'll assume the grid is from (0,0) bottom-left to (7,7) top-right, but since walls are at y=0 and y=7, y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, x=0 left, x=7 right. Snake head at (3,1), which is x=3, y=1.\n> \n> Current snake positions: head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4). So let's list the cells:\n> \n> - Head: (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (2,1) – this is left of head\n> \n> - Segment 2: (2,2) – above (2,1)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (2,3) – above (2,2)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (3,3) – right of (2,3)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (3,4) – above (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (4,4) – right of (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (5,4) – right of (4,4)\n> \n> Tail is at (5,4).\n> \n> Head direction is R, so it came from left, meaning previous move was from (2,1) to (3,1) by moving right.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (3,1): up (U) to (3,2), down (D) to (3,0), left (L) to (2,1), right (R) to (4,1).\n> \n> But need to check for collisions and walls.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.

Cannot move up.\n> \n> - D to (3,0): y=0 is wall, so also deadly collision. Cannot move down.\n> \n> - L to (2,1): (2,1) is a body segment. Is it safe? The snake body: positions are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), etc. (2,1) is occupied by the first body segment.\n> \n> But according to rules, body collision is deadly only if head touches any body segment except the tail in certain cases. Rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, (2,1) is not the tail; tail is at (5,4). So moving left to (2,1) would collide with body segment, deadly. Cannot move left.\n> \n> - R to (4,1): what is at (4,1)? From snake positions, (4,4) is a segment, but (4,1) is not listed, so should be empty? Let's see the grid.\n> \n> Snake occupies: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4). So (4,1) is not occupied, and not a wall. x=4, y=1 is within bounds, x=4 between 0 and 7, y=1 not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacles only (3,2), so (4,1) should be free.\n> \n> Therefore, the only possible move from current position is right (R) to (4,1). Is that right?\n> \n> But head direction is R, and no instant reverse, but since we're moving right, and possible moves are U, D, L, R, but U, D, L are all invalid due to walls or body, so only R is possible.\n> \n> Confirming:\n> \n> - U: (3,2) obstacle\n> \n> - D: (3,0) wall\n> \n> - L: (2,1) body segment\n> \n> - R: (4,1) empty\n> \n> Yes, so at turn 30, must move right to (4,1).\n> \n> Then, after moving, snake will have new head at (4,1), and since it ate no food, length unchanged, so tail moves away. Tail was at (5,4), but when snake moves, head to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so tail is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> Snake movement: when moving without eating, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> So after moving right to (4,1):\n> \n> - New head: (4,1)\n> \n> - Then body: previous head (3,1) becomes first segment, then (2,1) becomes second, but (2,1) was second, now it will be at (3,1)?

Since life span decreases every turn, at turn 30, it has life span 2. After turn 30, it will have life span 1 at turn 31. After turn 31, it disappears if not eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,5) with life span 8, so it will last until turn 37 or so.\n> \n> Now, head is at (4,1) after turn 30 move.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,1): U to (4,2), D to (4,0), L to (3,1), R to (5,1).\n> \n> Check:\n> \n> - D to (4,0): y=0 wall, deadly, invalid.\n> \n> - L to (3,1): (3,1) is now a body segment (the first body segment after head). In new positions, (3,1) is occupied by body, not tail. Tail is at (4,4). So moving to (3,1) would collide with body, deadly. Invalid.\n> \n> - U to (4,2): what is (4,2)? Not a wall, not in snake? Snake positions: (4,1) head, (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4). So (4,2) not occupied, not wall (x=4,y=2, walls only borders and (3,2) obstacle? (3,2) is obstacle, but (4,2) is different cell. Internal obstacle only (3,2), so (4,2) should be free.\n> \n> - R to (5,1): (5,1) not occupied, not wall.\n> \n> Also, head direction is R, so moving left would be reverse, but since we can only not do instant reverse, moving left to (3,1) is invalid anyway due to body collision, so not an option.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (4,2) or R to (5,1).\n> \n> Now, we need to think about getting food.\n> \n> Food at (4,5) is above, at (4,5), which is same x, y=5.\n> \n> From (4,1), to reach (4,5), need to go up, but there might be obstacles.\n> \n> Also, food at (1,5) is left and up.\n> \n> But let's see the path.\n> \n> First, since (4,5) has short life span, only available for turn 31 (since at turn 31, life span 1, disappears after turn 31).\n> \n> At turn 30, life span 2, after turn 30 (current turn), it decreases to 1 at turn 31. Then at turn 31, if eaten, good; if not, after turn 31, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So can be eaten on turn 31 only? No.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> At turn t, food has life_span L.\n> \n> After turn t, if not eaten, life_span becomes L-1.\n> \n> It can be eaten on turn t if head moves to it during turn t.\n> \n> Then, after eating, it is consumed.\n> \n> If not eaten by the time life_span reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> For (4,5): at turn 30, life_span=2, so it can be eaten on turn 30 or 31.\n> \n> On turn 30, head was at (3,1), and we moved to (4,1), not to (4,5), so not eaten on turn 30.\n> \n> After turn 30, life_span decreases to 1 for turn 31.\n> \n> So on turn 31, if head moves to (4,5), it can be eaten, but only if we can get there in one move from current position after turn 30.\n> \n> After turn 30, head at (4,1), (4,5) is at same x, y=5, so |dy| =4, not adjacent, cannot reach in one move. We need multiple moves to get there.\n> \n> From (4,1), we can move U to (4,2) or R to (5,1).\n> \n> To reach (4,5), we need to go up, but y=1 to y=5, 4 steps up, but we have only one turn to eat it, turn 31, but from (4,1), we can only move to adjacent cells, so (4,2) or (5,1), neither is (4,5).

Life span 2 means it disappears after 2 turns, including the current turn. So if not eaten by turn 31, it might disappear? Let's see: life span decreases every turn, including current.

Value 1 is positive food, so both are positive food since value is 1 for both.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for the next 5+ turns to maximize score while avoiding risks. I should think about possible moves and their consequences.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. I'll assume the grid is from (0,0) bottom-left to (7,7) top-right, but since walls are at y=0 and y=7, y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, x=0 left, x=7 right.

Internal obstacles only (3,2), so (4,1) should be free.\n> \n> Therefore, the only possible move from current position is right (R) to (4,1). Is that right?\n> \n> But head direction is R, and no instant reverse, but since we're moving right, and possible moves are U, D, L, R, but U, D, L are all invalid due to walls or body, so only R is possible.\n> \n> Confirming:\n> \n> - U: (3,2) obstacle\n> \n> - D: (3,0) wall\n> \n> - L: (2,1) body segment\n> \n> - R: (4,1) empty\n> \n> Yes, so at turn 30, must move right to (4,1).\n> \n> Then, after moving, snake will have new head at (4,1), and since it ate no food, length unchanged, so tail moves away.

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State (Turn \\( t_0 = 33 \\))\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current game state:\n\n- **Grid Dimensions**: 8x8 grid with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n- **Snake Positions**: \n  - Head: (4,3)\n  - Body: [(4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)]\n  - Tail: (3,3)\n- **Snake Head Direction**: Up (U)\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,5): value = +1, life_span = 6\n  - (1,3): value = +1, life_span = 8\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves from Current Position (4,3)\n\nFrom the head position (4,3), with current direction U, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (4,4)\n   - Check if (4,4) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=4 (1-6), y=4 (1-6), not (3,2).\n     - Not occupied by snake: Current snake positions are up to (3,3), so (4,4) is free.\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (4,2)\n   - Check if (4,2) is valid:\n     - Occupied by the snake's body segment (4,2), which is not the tail (tail is at (3,3)).\n     - Moving here would cause a collision with the body.\n   - Invalid move.\n\n3. **Left (L)**: (3,3)\n   - Check if (3,3) is valid:\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Occupied by the tail (3,3).\n     - According to rules, moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move away.\n   - Valid move.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: (5,3)\n   - Check if (5,3) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=5 (1-6), y=3 (1-6).\n     - Not occupied by snake.\n   - Valid move.\n\nSo, the possible valid moves from (4,3) are: U, L, R.\n\n### Evaluating the Moves Based on the Previous Plan\n\nFrom the previous thinking model's plan at turn \\( t_1 = 32 \\), the sequence was:\n\n- Turn 32: U\n- Turn 33: L\n- Turn 34: L\n- Turn 35: L\n- Turn 36: U\n\nAt turn \\( t_0 = 33 \\), the previous plan suggests moving L (Left) to (3,3).\n\nLet's verify if following this plan is still optimal:\n\n1. **Move L to (3,3)**:\n   - New head: (3,3)\n   - Body segments shift: \n     - New S1: (4,3)\n     - New S2: (4,2)\n     - ...\n     - New tail: (2,3)\n   - (3,3) was the tail, so moving here is safe.\n   - Next, from (3,3), possible moves would be to approach (1,3) or (1,5).\n\n2. **Alternative Moves**:\n   - **U to (4,4)**:\n     - Moves away from the food at (1,3) and (1,5).\n     - May delay reaching the food before their life spans expire.\n   - **R to (5,3)**:\n     - Also moves away from the food.\n     - Similar issue as moving U.\n\nGiven that the food at (1,3) and (1,5) are to the left, moving L aligns with the goal of reaching them efficiently.\n\n### Checking for Risks in Moving L to (3,3)\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: \n  - Current tail is at (3,3), and we're moving the head there.\n  - The tail (3,3) does not have food under it (food is at (1,5) and (1,3)).\n  - No risk of Tail Reward Danger.\n  \n- **Collision with Body**:\n  - Only the tail is at (3,3), and moving into the tail is safe as per rules.\n  \n- **Obstacle at (3,2)**:\n  - Not in the path when moving to (3,3).\n\n### Life Span Consideration\n\n- **Food at (1,5)**:\n  - Current life_span = 6 at turn 33.\n  - Will disappear after turn 33 + 6 = turn 39.\n  \n- **Food at (1,3)**:\n  - Current life_span = 8 at turn 33.\n  - Will disappear after turn 33 + 8 = turn 41.\n\nWe have until turn 39 to eat (1,5) and until turn 41 to eat (1,3). Following the previous plan allows us to reach (1,3) by turn 35 and (1,5) by turn 37, which is within their life spans.\n\n### Verifying the Next Steps After Moving L at Turn 33\n\nAfter moving L to (3,3) at turn 33:\n\n- **Turn 34**: From (3,3), possible moves:\n  - L to (2,3): \n    - (2,3) is the new tail (from shifted body).\n    - Safe to move here.\n  - Other moves may not lead directly to food.\n\n- **Turn 35**: From (2,3), move L to (1,3) to eat the food there.\n\nThis aligns with the previous plan and ensures we eat both foods efficiently.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFollowing the previous plan's suggestion to move L at turn 33 is optimal because:\n\n1. It directly paths towards the positive food at (1,3) and subsequently (1,5).\n2. It avoids collisions and obstacles.\n3. It ensures eating both foods before their life spans expire.\n4. There are no immediate risks like Tail Reward Danger or body collisions.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

It's turn 34, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm: walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x from 1 to 6 is inside; similarly y=0 and y=7, so y from 1 to 6. But let's list all wall cells: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, and internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Also, snake positions: head at (3,3), then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is L, meaning left, so it's moving towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,5) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (1,3) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive, no negative food here. But I need to be careful with the tail reward danger.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,5), life span 5, so it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 34, life span 5 means it will disappear after turn 38? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, it decreases each turn, so after N-1 turns it will be gone? No.\n> \n> Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at the start of turn t, if life span is N, after this turn (turn t), it decreases to N-1. Then after turn t+1, to N-2, and so on, until it reaches 0, and disappears before the next turn or something.\n> \n> Typically, if at turn t, life span is N, it means it has N turns left including the current one. So after N turns, it's gone. For example, at turn t, life span N, after turn t, it has N-1 left; after turn t+1, N-2, ..., after turn t + (N-1), it has 1 left, and after turn t + N, it should be gone, so it disappears between turns or at the start of turn t+N+1? But for simplicity, since we plan actions per turn, we should consider that at the beginning of turn t, the food is present if life span > 0, and after the turn, life span decreases.\n> \n> But for planning, when we say \"disappears after N turns\", it means it will not be available after turn t + N - 1 or something? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the start of a turn, if life span is L, then during that turn, the food can be eaten, and at the end of the turn, life span decreases by 1. If life span was 1, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so not available for the next turn.\n> \n> Similarly, for new turns.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 34:\n> \n> Food (1,5): life span 5, so available on turns 34,35,36,37,38. After turn 38, it disappears, so not available on turn 39.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3): life span 7, available turns 34 to 40.\n> \n> (4,1): life span 10, available turns 34 to 43.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (3,3), moving left (direction L). So from (3,3), possible moves: since direction is L, it can go L, U, or D, but not R because no instant reverse. Reverse of L is R, so it cannot go right immediately.\n> \n> Current head direction L, so next move can be L, U, D, but not R.\n> \n> Now, let's list the snake body to avoid collisions.\n> \n> Snake segments: indices 0 to 7: (3,3) head, (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) tail.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail might be free if no food or something, but in terms of collision, the head cannot move into a body segment except the tail, because the tail will move away.\n> \n> Collision rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, when moving, if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the current tail, it collides and dies. If it moves to the tail cell, it's ok because after moving, the tail moves away, and the head is there, but since the snake grows only when eating food, if it doesn't eat, the tail moves, so the cell is free.\n> \n> In this case, since we might eat food, but when moving to tail, if there is food, it could be eaten only if head moves onto it after tail moves, but the rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> But for the tail cell, if there is food under it, when the tail moves away, the food is revealed, and if head moves to that cell, it can eat it. But in this case, the food at (4,1) is on a body segment? Let's see.\n> \n> Food at (4,1): snake has segment at (4,1), which is position index 3. Is it the tail? Tail is at (2,3), so (4,1) is a body segment, not tail. So food at (4,1) is under the snake body, so it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (1,5) and (1,3) are not on snake body, so can be eaten directly if head moves there.\n> \n> (1,5) is at (1,5), snake positions: let's list all occupied cells: (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). So (1,5) not occupied, (1,3) not occupied, (4,1) occupied by snake body.\n> \n> So (4,1) has food under it, but since it's a body segment, it can't be eaten until the snake moves away from that cell.\n> \n> Now, the food at (4,1) has value 1, life span 10, so plenty of time.\n> \n> But there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (2,3). Head is at (3,3), which is adjacent to (2,3)? (3,3) and (2,3) are adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: up, down, left, right, so (3,3) and (2,3) are adjacent, yes, since left of (3,3) is (2,3).\n> \n> So head is adjacent to tail.\n> \n> Now, the tail cell (2,3) has food? Food positions: (1,5), (1,3), (4,1). No food at (2,3), so no issue for now. But if there were food on tail, and head moves to eat it, it would be bad, but here no food on tail.\n> \n> Food on (4,1) is under a body segment, not tail.\n> \n> So for now, no immediate tail reward danger.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for turn 34 and beyond, thinking 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n> \n> First, possible moves from current position (3,3) with direction L.\n> \n> Can go L to (2,3), but (2,3) is the current tail position. Since it's tail, moving to (2,3) is safe because tail will move away.\n> \n> Can go U to (3,4), or D to (3,2), but (3,2) is a wall? Walls: internal obstacle at (3,2), so (3,2) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Also border walls, but (3,3) is inside.\n> \n> So possible moves:\n> \n> - L: to (2,3) — current tail, safe\n> \n> - U: to (3,4) — should be free, let's check snake positions: (3,4) not in list, and not wall? Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, internal (3,2), so (3,4) should be free.\n> \n> - D: to (3,2) — but (3,2) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move.\n> \n> - R: to (4,3) — but (4,3) is body segment, index 1, not tail, so moving there would cause collision, death. Cannot.\n> \n> So only possible moves: L to (2,3) or U to (3,4).\n> \n> Now, if I go L to (2,3), since it's the tail, and no food there, I just move, snake doesn't grow, tail moves to the next position.\n> \n> After move, head to (2,3), tail was (2,3), but since no eat, tail moves away to (2,2)?

Before, tail was (2,3), after move, since no grow, tail is removed, so new positions: head (2,3), then (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), and (2,2) is now the tail?

It's turn 34, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm: walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x from 1 to 6 is inside; similarly y=0 and y=7, so y from 1 to 6. But let's list all wall cells: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, and internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Also, snake positions: head at (3,3), then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is L, meaning left, so it's moving towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,5) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (1,3) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive, no negative food here. But I need to be careful with the tail reward danger.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,5), life span 5, so it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 34, life span 5 means it will disappear after turn 38? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, it decreases each turn, so after N-1 turns it will be gone? No.\n> \n> Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at the start of turn t, if life span is N, after this turn (turn t), it decreases to N-1. Then after turn t+1, to N-2, and so on, until it reaches 0, and disappears before the next turn or something.\n> \n> Typically, if at turn t, life span is N, it means it has N turns left including the current one. So after N turns, it's gone. For example, at turn t, life span N, after turn t, it has N-1 left; after turn t+1, N-2, ..., after turn t + (N-1), it has 1 left, and after turn t + N, it should be gone, so it disappears between turns or at the start of turn t+N+1? But for simplicity, since we plan actions per turn, we should consider that at the beginning of turn t, the food is present if life span > 0, and after the turn, life span decreases.\n> \n> But for planning, when we say \"disappears after N turns\", it means it will not be available after turn t + N - 1 or something? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the start of a turn, if life span is L, then during that turn, the food can be eaten, and at the end of the turn, life span decreases by 1. If life span was 1, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so not available for the next turn.\n> \n> Similarly, for new turns.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 34:\n> \n> Food (1,5): life span 5, so available on turns 34,35,36,37,38. After turn 38, it disappears, so not available on turn 39.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3): life span 7, available turns 34 to 40.\n> \n> (4,1): life span 10, available turns 34 to 43.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (3,3), moving left (direction L). So from (3,3), possible moves: since direction is L, it can go L, U, or D, but not R because no instant reverse. Reverse of L is R, so it cannot go right immediately.\n> \n> Current head direction L, so next move can be L, U, D, but not R.\n> \n> Now, let's list the snake body to avoid collisions.\n> \n> Snake segments: indices 0 to 7: (3,3) head, (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) tail.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail might be free if no food or something, but in terms of collision, the head cannot move into a body segment except the tail, because the tail will move away.\n> \n> Collision rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, when moving, if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the current tail, it collides and dies. If it moves to the tail cell, it's ok because after moving, the tail moves away, and the head is there, but since the snake grows only when eating food, if it doesn't eat, the tail moves, so the cell is free.\n> \n> In this case, since we might eat food, but when moving to tail, if there is food, it could be eaten only if head moves onto it after tail moves, but the rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> But for the tail cell, if there is food under it, when the tail moves away, the food is revealed, and if head moves to that cell, it can eat it. But in this case, the food at (4,1) is on a body segment? Let's see.\n> \n> Food at (4,1): snake has segment at (4,1), which is position index 3. Is it the tail? Tail is at (2,3), so (4,1) is a body segment, not tail. So food at (4,1) is under the snake body, so it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (1,5) and (1,3) are not on snake body, so can be eaten directly if head moves there.\n> \n> (1,5) is at (1,5), snake positions: let's list all occupied cells: (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). So (1,5) not occupied, (1,3) not occupied, (4,1) occupied by snake body.\n> \n> So (4,1) has food under it, but since it's a body segment, it can't be eaten until the snake moves away from that cell.\n> \n> Now, the food at (4,1) has value 1, life span 10, so plenty of time.\n> \n> But there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (2,3). Head is at (3,3), which is adjacent to (2,3)? (3,3) and (2,3) are adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: up, down, left, right, so (3,3) and (2,3) are adjacent, yes, since left of (3,3) is (2,3).\n> \n> So head is adjacent to tail.\n> \n> Now, the tail cell (2,3) has food? Food positions: (1,5), (1,3), (4,1). No food at (2,3), so no issue for now. But if there were food on tail, and head moves to eat it, it would be bad, but here no food on tail.\n> \n> Food on (4,1) is under a body segment, not tail.\n> \n> So for now, no immediate tail reward danger.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for turn 34 and beyond, thinking 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n> \n> First, possible moves from current position (3,3) with direction L.\n> \n> Can go L to (2,3), but (2,3) is the current tail position.

Walls: internal obstacle at (3,2), so (3,2) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Also border walls, but (3,3) is inside.\n> \n> So possible moves:\n> \n> - L: to (2,3) — current tail, safe\n> \n> - U: to (3,4) — should be free, let's check snake positions: (3,4) not in list, and not wall?

After move, head at (1,4), body segments: old head (1,3) becomes new segment 1, then (2,3) becomes segment 2, and so on, down to tail (2,2) which moves to (2,1)? Let's simulate.\n> \n> Current positions: H(1,3), B1(2,3), B2(3,3), B3(4,3), B4(4,2), B5(4,1), B6(3,1), B7(2,1), T(2,2)\n> \n> If I move U to (1,4):\n> \n> New head: (1,4)\n> \n> Then body: segment 1: old head (1,3)\n> \n> Segment 2: old B1 (2,3)\n> \n> Segment 3: old B2 (3,3)\n> \n> Segment 4: old B3 (4,3)\n> \n> Segment 5: old B4 (4,2)\n> \n> Segment 6: old B5 (4,1)\n> \n> Segment 7: old B6 (3,1)\n> \n> Segment 8: old B7 (2,1)\n> \n> Tail: old T (2,2) is removed since no food eaten? No, when no food, tail is removed, so the new snake has segments: head (1,4), then (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). So tail is now (2,1).\n> \n> Positions: [(1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)]\n> \n> Now, is (1,4) occupied by any body? Body cells are (1,3), (2,3), etc., not (1,4), so safe. Also, not wall.\n> \n> Similarly, move D to (1,2): head to (1,2), then body: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), and tail (2,2) removed? New positions: [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)] tail at (2,1). (1,2) not in body, so safe.\n> \n> Move L to (0,3): but x=0 is wall, invalid, cannot.\n> \n> Move R to (2,3): (2,3) is currently body segment B1. But after move, head goes to (2,3), and body moves: segment 1 is old head (1,3), segment 2 is old B1 which was (2,3) but now it moves to where? When head moves to (2,3), which is currently occupied, but after move, the body shifts.\n> \n> New head: (2,3)\n> \n> Then segment 1: old head (1,3)\n> \n> Segment 2: old B1 (2,3) but since head is moving to (2,3), and B1 was at (2,3), it will move to the next position.\n> \n> After move, positions: head (2,3), then segment 1: (1,3), segment 2: old B2 (3,3), segment 3: old B3 (4,3), segment 4: old B4 (4,2), segment 5: old B5 (4,1), segment 6: old B6 (3,1), segment 7: old B7 (2,1), and tail: old T (2,2) removed? No food, so tail removed, new tail is old B7 (2,1)? Let's list:\n> \n> New positions: [(2,3), (1,3), (2,3) is head, but (1,3) is segment 1, then segment 2 should be old B1, which was (2,3), but now (2,3) is head, so segment 2 is the next, which is old B2 (3,3), then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). And tail is (2,1), since old T (2,2) is gone.\n> \n> But head is at (2,3), and segment 1 is at (1,3), different cells. Is there a body segment at (2,3)? After move, (2,3) is head, and the body includes (1,3), (3,3), etc., so (2,3) is only head, not body. Body segments are (1,3), (3,3), (4,3), etc. So no collision at (2,3).\n> \n> Moreover, moving to (2,3) is safe because it was the position of B1, but after move, B1 moves to where B2 was or something. Specifically, since the snake moves forward, the cell that was occupied by a body segment might be freed if it's the tail, but here (2,3) was not tail.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (2,3) is fine because after the move, that cell is the head, and the previous occupant has moved away.\n> \n> Similarly, in the U move, we saw it was fine.\n> \n> But in this case, for move R to (2,3), it should be allowed, and no collision.\n> \n> Current direction is L, and R is opposite, so I cannot move R because of no instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> Current direction is L (left), so opposite is R (right), so I cannot move R on this turn. So R is invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, from (1,3), possible moves: U, D, L.\n> \n> L is to (0,3) which is wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only U and D are possible.\n> \n> U to (1,4) or D to (1,2).\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the food.\n> \n> Food at (1,5) with life span 3. Since current turn is 36, it will disappear after turn 38? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Life span 3 on turn 36: it exists on turns 36,37,38, disappears on turn 39? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (1,5) with life span 3 on turn 36, it will be present on turn 36,37,38. After turn 38, it disappears, so not available on turn 39.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,1) with life span 8, present from turn 36 to 43, disappears after turn 43.\n> \n> Now, food at (4,1) is currently under the snake's body at segment B5 (4,1). So to eat it, the snake needs to move away from (4,1) and then have the head come back when it's free.\n> \n> But the head is far, at (1,3), and the snake is long, so it might be tricky.\n> \n> Food at (1,5) is at (1,5), which is above (1,4).\n> \n> Current head at (1,3), if I move U to (1,4), I'm at (1,4), then next turn I can move U to (1,5) to eat the food, but only if it's still there.\n> \n> Life span 3, so on turn 36,37,38.\n> \n> If I move U on turn 36 to (1,4), then on turn 37 I can move U to (1,5) to eat it, since turn 37 is within life span.\n> \n> Turn 36: move to (1,4), food still there? On turn 36, food at (1,5) is present.\n> \n> After move to (1,4), turn 36 ends, then turn 37: I move to (1,5), and if food is still there, I eat it.\n> \n> On turn 37, life span decreases to 2? On turn 36, life span is 3, after turn 36, it decreases to 2 for turn 37.\n> \n> Food exists as long as life span > 0, I think.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, so on turn t, life span L means it will disappear after L more turns, so available for L turns including current.\n> \n> So for (1,5), life span 3 on turn 36: available on turn 36 (L=3), turn 37 (L=2), turn 38 (L=1), gone on turn 39.\n> \n> So on turn 37, it is available with L=2.\n> \n> So if I go to (1,4) on turn 36, then to (1,5) on turn 37, I can eat it.\n> \n> But is (1,5) safe to move to?\n> \n> First, let's see if moving U on turn 36 is safe.\n> \n> Move U to (1,4): as before, new positions: head (1,4), body (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). Tail at (2,1).\n> \n> (1,4) is empty, not wall, not body, so safe.\n> \n> Then on turn 37, if I move U to (1,5), new head (1,5), and since I eat food, a new segment is added. So snake grows: head (1,5), then segment 1: (1,4), segment 2: (1,3), and so on, down to (2,1), and new tail at old tail position? When eating, the tail doesn't move, so new segment is added at the tail.\n> \n> After move to (1,5), head at (1,5), body segments: old head becomes new segment 1: (1,4), then old segment 1: (1,3), old segment 2: (2,3), ..., up to old segment 8: (2,1), and since food eaten, new segment added, so tail is now (2,1), and a new segment at the previous tail position? No.\n> \n> Standard: when food eaten, the head moves to the food, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move. Positions: new head at food, then the previous segments, and tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, on turn 37, before move, positions: head (1,4), body (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n> \n> After move U to (1,5): head to (1,5), which has food, so eaten. New head (1,5), then segment 1: previous head (1,4), segment 2: previous segment 1 (1,3), segment 3: previous segment 2 (2,3), ..., segment 9: previous segment 8 (2,1), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the end, so segment 10: previous tail position (2,1)? The tail position before move was (2,1), and since we add a new segment there, it becomes (2,1) again? Let's think.\n> \n> Typically, when no eat, tail moves away; when eat, tail stays, and body extends.\n> \n> Before move, tail is at (2,1).\n> \n> After moving head to (1,5) and eating, the new snake: head at (1,5), then the first body segment is the old head (1,4), then old segment 1 (1,3), old segment 2 (2,3), ..., old segment 8 which was the tail (2,1), and since food eaten, we add a new segment at the position where the tail was, so (2,1) now has a segment, and the tail is still at (2,1), but with an extra segment.\n> \n> Positions: new head (1,5), then:\n> \n> - Body segment 1: old head (1,4)\n> \n> - Body segment 2: old segment 1 (1,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 3: old segment 2 (2,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 4: old segment 3 (3,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 5: old segment 4 (4,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 6: old segment 5 (4,2)\n> \n> - Body segment 7: old segment 6 (4,1)\n> \n> - Body segment 8: old segment 7 (3,1)\n> \n> - Body segment 9: old segment 8 (2,1)  // which was tail\n> \n> - And new body segment 10: added at old tail position, so (2,1)? But (2,1) is already occupied by segment 9? I think I confused.\n> \n> Better: after eating, the head moves to the new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, and since food eaten, a new segment is created at the position of the old tail, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is added there.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose before move, positions are P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., Pk (tail).\n> \n> After move to new position Q (with food):\n> \n> - New head: Q\n> \n> - New segment 1: P0\n> \n> - New segment 2: P1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - New segment k: P_{k-1}\n> \n> - New segment k+1: Pk (old tail position)\n> \n> So the new tail is at Pk.\n> \n> In this case, before move on turn 37: positions H(1,4), S1(1,3), S2(2,3), S3(3,3), S4(4,3), S5(4,2), S6(4,1), S7(3,1), S8(2,1)  // S8 is tail\n> \n> After move to (1,5) and eat:\n> \n> - New head: (1,5)\n> \n> - New S1: old H (1,4)\n> \n> - New S2: old S1 (1,3)\n> \n> - New S3: old S2 (2,3)\n> \n> - New S4: old S3 (3,3)\n> \n> - New S5: old S4 (4,3)\n> \n> - New S6: old S5 (4,2)\n> \n> - New S7: old S6 (4,1)\n> \n> - New S8: old S7 (3,1)\n> \n> - New S9: old S8 (2,1)  // tail\n> \n> - And since food eaten, add new segment at old tail position (2,1), so new S10: (2,1)\n> \n> But (2,1) is now occupied by S9 and S10? That can't be; positions must be unique.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> Standard snake: when eating, the tail stays in place, so the new segment is added at the tail position, meaning that position now has the tail segment, and the previous tail is now part of body.\n> \n> Positions after move and eat: head at new position, then the entire previous snake body, including the tail, becomes the new body, and a new segment is added at the end, which is the new tail at the same position as the old tail.\n> \n> But since the tail didn't move, it's the same cell.\n> \n> In terms of cells: for example, if tail was at C, and we eat, after move, tail is still at C, and a new segment is there, so C has the new tail, and the previous segment is now the second last.\n> \n> But the cell C is occupied by the tail segment.\n> \n> In this case, before move, tail at (2,1).\n> \n> After moving head to (1,5) and eating, the new snake has head at (1,5), then the old head (1,4), then old S1 (1,3), ..., up to old S8 (2,1), and since we add a new segment, it is at (2,1), so the new tail is at (2,1), and the previous segment is old S8, but old S8 was at (2,1), so now new S9 is at (2,1), and new S10 is also at (2,1)? Conflict.\n> \n> No: the new segments are: new head at (1,5), new segment 1 at old head (1,4), new segment 2 at old S1 (1,3), new segment 3 at old S2 (2,3), ..., new segment 9 at old S8 (2,1), and then new segment 10 added at the position of the old tail, which is (2,1), so new segment 10 at (2,1). But that means two segments at (2,1), which is impossible.\n> \n> I think I have a fundamental mistake.\n> \n> Correct way: when the snake eats food, the head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but the tail does not move; it stays in place, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail.\n> \n> Positions: after moving the head to the new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, but since food is eaten, the last segment (tail) does not move; it stays, and a new segment is not added separately; rather, the tail remains, so the length increases.\n> \n> For example, suppose positions before move: H, B1, B2, T\n> \n> Move to new cell Q with food: new head at Q, new B1 at H, new B2 at B1, and new T at T (since tail doesn't move), and because of growth, there is an additional segment at the old T position, but since T stays, it's like the tail position has a segment that doesn't move.\n> \n> In terms of list: before: [H, B1, B2, T]\n> \n> After move to Q with eat: [Q, H, B1, B2, T]  // T stays, so new positions include T as part of body, and tail is still T.\n> \n> So length increased by one, tail is at T.\n> \n> In my earlier case:\n> \n> Before move on turn 37: positions [ (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1) ] let's call them P0 to P8, with P0 head (1,4), P1 (1,3), P2 (2,3), P3 (3,3), P4 (4,3), P5 (4,2), P6 (4,1), P7 (3,1), P8 (2,1) tail.\n> \n> After move U to (1,5) with eat: new head at (1,5), then new body: P0 at (1,4), P1 at (1,3), P2 at (2,3), P3 at (3,3), P4 at (4,3), P5 at (4,2), P6 at (4,1), P7 at (3,1), P8 at (2,1), and since eat, tail stays, so P8 is still at (2,1), and new tail is at (2,1). So the new snake has 10 segments: head (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1).\n> \n> Tail at (2,1).\n> \n> Now, (1,5) is not occupied by any body, so moving there is fine.\n> \n> Back to turn 36.\n> \n> If I move U to (1,4) on turn 36, then on turn 37 I can move U to (1,5) to eat the food, gaining +1 and length increases.\n> \n> But I need to check if (1,5) is safe.

Snake positions include (4,1), which is segment 5. Food at (4,1) is listed, but the snake is already on (4,1)? That might be a problem.\n> \n> Food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> In this case, food at (4,1) is under the snake's body segment (4,1). Since it's a body segment, not the head, it can be eaten later if the snake moves away and then head comes back.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,5) is not occupied by snake, so it's free to eat if I can get there.\n> \n> Head direction is L, so current movement is left.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, L, R. But no instant reverse, so since current direction is L, I cannot move R (right) on the next turn. So possible moves from (1,3) are U (up), D (down), or L (left).

After move, head at (1,4), body segments: old head (1,3) becomes new segment 1, then (2,3) becomes segment 2, and so on, down to tail (2,2) which moves to (2,1)? Let's simulate.\n> \n> Current positions: H(1,3), B1(2,3), B2(3,3), B3(4,3), B4(4,2), B5(4,1), B6(3,1), B7(2,1), T(2,2)\n> \n> If I move U to (1,4):\n> \n> New head: (1,4)\n> \n> Then body: segment 1: old head (1,3)\n> \n> Segment 2: old B1 (2,3)\n> \n> Segment 3: old B2 (3,3)\n> \n> Segment 4: old B3 (4,3)\n> \n> Segment 5: old B4 (4,2)\n> \n> Segment 6: old B5 (4,1)\n> \n> Segment 7: old B6 (3,1)\n> \n> Segment 8: old B7 (2,1)\n> \n> Tail: old T (2,2) is removed since no food eaten? No, when no food, tail is removed, so the new snake has segments: head (1,4), then (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). So tail is now (2,1).\n> \n> Positions: [(1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)]\n> \n> Now, is (1,4) occupied by any body? Body cells are (1,3), (2,3), etc., not (1,4), so safe. Also, not wall.\n> \n> Similarly, move D to (1,2): head to (1,2), then body: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), and tail (2,2) removed? New positions: [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)] tail at (2,1). (1,2) not in body, so safe.\n> \n> Move L to (0,3): but x=0 is wall, invalid, cannot.\n> \n> Move R to (2,3): (2,3) is currently body segment B1. But after move, head goes to (2,3), and body moves: segment 1 is old head (1,3), segment 2 is old B1 which was (2,3) but now it moves to where? When head moves to (2,3), which is currently occupied, but after move, the body shifts.\n> \n> New head: (2,3)\n> \n> Then segment 1: old head (1,3)\n> \n> Segment 2: old B1 (2,3) but since head is moving to (2,3), and B1 was at (2,3), it will move to the next position.\n> \n> After move, positions: head (2,3), then segment 1: (1,3), segment 2: old B2 (3,3), segment 3: old B3 (4,3), segment 4: old B4 (4,2), segment 5: old B5 (4,1), segment 6: old B6 (3,1), segment 7: old B7 (2,1), and tail: old T (2,2) removed? No food, so tail removed, new tail is old B7 (2,1)? Let's list:\n> \n> New positions: [(2,3), (1,3), (2,3) is head, but (1,3) is segment 1, then segment 2 should be old B1, which was (2,3), but now (2,3) is head, so segment 2 is the next, which is old B2 (3,3), then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). And tail is (2,1), since old T (2,2) is gone.\n> \n> But head is at (2,3), and segment 1 is at (1,3), different cells. Is there a body segment at (2,3)? After move, (2,3) is head, and the body includes (1,3), (3,3), etc., so (2,3) is only head, not body. Body segments are (1,3), (3,3), (4,3), etc. So no collision at (2,3).\n> \n> Moreover, moving to (2,3) is safe because it was the position of B1, but after move, B1 moves to where B2 was or something. Specifically, since the snake moves forward, the cell that was occupied by a body segment might be freed if it's the tail, but here (2,3) was not tail.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (2,3) is fine because after the move, that cell is the head, and the previous occupant has moved away.\n> \n> Similarly, in the U move, we saw it was fine.\n> \n> But in this case, for move R to (2,3), it should be allowed, and no collision.\n> \n> Current direction is L, and R is opposite, so I cannot move R because of no instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> Current direction is L (left), so opposite is R (right), so I cannot move R on this turn. So R is invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, from (1,3), possible moves: U, D, L.\n> \n> L is to (0,3) which is wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only U and D are possible.\n> \n> U to (1,4) or D to (1,2).\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the food.\n> \n> Food at (1,5) with life span 3. Since current turn is 36, it will disappear after turn 38? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Life span 3 on turn 36: it exists on turns 36,37,38, disappears on turn 39? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (1,5) with life span 3 on turn 36, it will be present on turn 36,37,38. After turn 38, it disappears, so not available on turn 39.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,1) with life span 8, present from turn 36 to 43, disappears after turn 43.\n> \n> Now, food at (4,1) is currently under the snake's body at segment B5 (4,1). So to eat it, the snake needs to move away from (4,1) and then have the head come back when it's free.\n> \n> But the head is far, at (1,3), and the snake is long, so it might be tricky.\n> \n> Food at (1,5) is at (1,5), which is above (1,4).\n> \n> Current head at (1,3), if I move U to (1,4), I'm at (1,4), then next turn I can move U to (1,5) to eat the food, but only if it's still there.\n> \n> Life span 3, so on turn 36,37,38.\n> \n> If I move U on turn 36 to (1,4), then on turn 37 I can move U to (1,5) to eat it, since turn 37 is within life span.\n> \n> Turn 36: move to (1,4), food still there? On turn 36, food at (1,5) is present.\n> \n> After move to (1,4), turn 36 ends, then turn 37: I move to (1,5), and if food is still there, I eat it.\n> \n> On turn 37, life span decreases to 2? On turn 36, life span is 3, after turn 36, it decreases to 2 for turn 37.\n> \n> Food exists as long as life span > 0, I think.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, so on turn t, life span L means it will disappear after L more turns, so available for L turns including current.\n> \n> So for (1,5), life span 3 on turn 36: available on turn 36 (L=3), turn 37 (L=2), turn 38 (L=1), gone on turn 39.\n> \n> So on turn 37, it is available with L=2.\n> \n> So if I go to (1,4) on turn 36, then to (1,5) on turn 37, I can eat it.\n> \n> But is (1,5) safe to move to?\n> \n> First, let's see if moving U on turn 36 is safe.\n> \n> Move U to (1,4): as before, new positions: head (1,4), body (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). Tail at (2,1).\n> \n> (1,4) is empty, not wall, not body, so safe.\n> \n> Then on turn 37, if I move U to (1,5), new head (1,5), and since I eat food, a new segment is added. So snake grows: head (1,5), then segment 1: (1,4), segment 2: (1,3), and so on, down to (2,1), and new tail at old tail position? When eating, the tail doesn't move, so new segment is added at the tail.\n> \n> After move to (1,5), head at (1,5), body segments: old head becomes new segment 1: (1,4), then old segment 1: (1,3), old segment 2: (2,3), ..., up to old segment 8: (2,1), and since food eaten, new segment added, so tail is now (2,1), and a new segment at the previous tail position? No.\n> \n> Standard: when food eaten, the head moves to the food, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move. Positions: new head at food, then the previous segments, and tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, on turn 37, before move, positions: head (1,4), body (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n> \n> After move U to (1,5): head to (1,5), which has food, so eaten. New head (1,5), then segment 1: previous head (1,4), segment 2: previous segment 1 (1,3), segment 3: previous segment 2 (2,3), ..., segment 9: previous segment 8 (2,1), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the end, so segment 10: previous tail position (2,1)? The tail position before move was (2,1), and since we add a new segment there, it becomes (2,1) again? Let's think.\n> \n> Typically, when no eat, tail moves away; when eat, tail stays, and body extends.\n> \n> Before move, tail is at (2,1).\n> \n> After moving head to (1,5) and eating, the new snake: head at (1,5), then the first body segment is the old head (1,4), then old segment 1 (1,3), old segment 2 (2,3), ..., old segment 8 which was the tail (2,1), and since food eaten, we add a new segment at the position where the tail was, so (2,1) now has a segment, and the tail is still at (2,1), but with an extra segment.\n> \n> Positions: new head (1,5), then:\n> \n> - Body segment 1: old head (1,4)\n> \n> - Body segment 2: old segment 1 (1,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 3: old segment 2 (2,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 4: old segment 3 (3,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 5: old segment 4 (4,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 6: old segment 5 (4,2)\n> \n> - Body segment 7: old segment 6 (4,1)\n> \n> - Body segment 8: old segment 7 (3,1)\n> \n> - Body segment 9: old segment 8 (2,1)  // which was tail\n> \n> - And new body segment 10: added at old tail position, so (2,1)? But (2,1) is already occupied by segment 9? I think I confused.\n> \n> Better: after eating, the head moves to the new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, and since food eaten, a new segment is created at the position of the old tail, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is added there.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose before move, positions are P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., Pk (tail).\n> \n> After move to new position Q (with food):\n> \n> - New head: Q\n> \n> - New segment 1: P0\n> \n> - New segment 2: P1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - New segment k: P_{k-1}\n> \n> - New segment k+1: Pk (old tail position)\n> \n> So the new tail is at Pk.\n> \n> In this case, before move on turn 37: positions H(1,4), S1(1,3), S2(2,3), S3(3,3), S4(4,3), S5(4,2), S6(4,1), S7(3,1), S8(2,1)  // S8 is tail\n> \n> After move to (1,5) and eat:\n> \n> - New head: (1,5)\n> \n> - New S1: old H (1,4)\n> \n> - New S2: old S1 (1,3)\n> \n> - New S3: old S2 (2,3)\n> \n> - New S4: old S3 (3,3)\n> \n> - New S5: old S4 (4,3)\n> \n> - New S6: old S5 (4,2)\n> \n> - New S7: old S6 (4,1)\n> \n> - New S8: old S7 (3,1)\n> \n> - New S9: old S8 (2,1)  // tail\n> \n> - And since food eaten, add new segment at old tail position (2,1), so new S10: (2,1)\n> \n> But (2,1) is now occupied by S9 and S10? That can't be; positions must be unique.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> Standard snake: when eating, the tail stays in place, so the new segment is added at the tail position, meaning that position now has the tail segment, and the previous tail is now part of body.\n> \n> Positions after move and eat: head at new position, then the entire previous snake body, including the tail, becomes the new body, and a new segment is added at the end, which is the new tail at the same position as the old tail.\n> \n> But since the tail didn't move, it's the same cell.\n> \n> In terms of cells: for example, if tail was at C, and we eat, after move, tail is still at C, and a new segment is there, so C has the new tail, and the previous segment is now the second last.\n> \n> But the cell C is occupied by the tail segment.\n> \n> In this case, before move, tail at (2,1).\n> \n> After moving head to (1,5) and eating, the new snake has head at (1,5), then the old head (1,4), then old S1 (1,3), ..., up to old S8 (2,1), and since we add a new segment, it is at (2,1), so the new tail is at (2,1), and the previous segment is old S8, but old S8 was at (2,1), so now new S9 is at (2,1), and new S10 is also at (2,1)? Conflict.\n> \n> No: the new segments are: new head at (1,5), new segment 1 at old head (1,4), new segment 2 at old S1 (1,3), new segment 3 at old S2 (2,3), ..., new segment 9 at old S8 (2,1), and then new segment 10 added at the position of the old tail, which is (2,1), so new segment 10 at (2,1). But that means two segments at (2,1), which is impossible.\n> \n> I think I have a fundamental mistake.\n> \n> Correct way: when the snake eats food, the head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but the tail does not move; it stays in place, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail.\n> \n> Positions: after moving the head to the new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, but since food is eaten, the last segment (tail) does not move; it stays, and a new segment is not added separately; rather, the tail remains, so the length increases.\n> \n> For example, suppose positions before move: H, B1, B2, T\n> \n> Move to new cell Q with food: new head at Q, new B1 at H, new B2 at B1, and new T at T (since tail doesn't move), and because of growth, there is an additional segment at the old T position, but since T stays, it's like the tail position has a segment that doesn't move.\n> \n> In terms of list: before: [H, B1, B2, T]\n> \n> After move to Q with eat: [Q, H, B1, B2, T]  // T stays, so new positions include T as part of body, and tail is still T.\n> \n> So length increased by one, tail is at T.\n> \n> In my earlier case:\n> \n> Before move on turn 37: positions [ (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1) ] let's call them P0 to P8, with P0 head (1,4), P1 (1,3), P2 (2,3), P3 (3,3), P4 (4,3), P5 (4,2), P6 (4,1), P7 (3,1), P8 (2,1) tail.\n> \n> After move U to (1,5) with eat: new head at (1,5), then new body: P0 at (1,4), P1 at (1,3), P2 at (2,3), P3 at (3,3), P4 at (4,3), P5 at (4,2), P6 at (4,1), P7 at (3,1), P8 at (2,1), and since eat, tail stays, so P8 is still at (2,1), and new tail is at (2,1).

Snake positions include (4,1), which is segment 5. Food at (4,1) is listed, but the snake is already on (4,1)? That might be a problem.\n> \n> Food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> In this case, food at (4,1) is under the snake's body segment (4,1). Since it's a body segment, not the head, it can be eaten later if the snake moves away and then head comes back.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,5) is not occupied by snake, so it's free to eat if I can get there.\n> \n> Head direction is L, so current movement is left.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, L, R.

After move, head at (1,4), body segments: old head (1,3) becomes new segment 1, then (2,3) becomes segment 2, and so on, down to tail (2,2) which moves to (2,1)?

No, when no food, tail is removed, so the new snake has segments: head (1,4), then (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). So tail is now (2,1).\n> \n> Positions: [(1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)]\n> \n> Now, is (1,4) occupied by any body?

New positions: [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)] tail at (2,1). (1,2) not in body, so safe.\n> \n> Move L to (0,3): but x=0 is wall, invalid, cannot.\n> \n> Move R to (2,3): (2,3) is currently body segment B1. But after move, head goes to (2,3), and body moves: segment 1 is old head (1,3), segment 2 is old B1 which was (2,3) but now it moves to where? When head moves to (2,3), which is currently occupied, but after move, the body shifts.\n> \n> New head: (2,3)\n> \n> Then segment 1: old head (1,3)\n> \n> Segment 2: old B1 (2,3) but since head is moving to (2,3), and B1 was at (2,3), it will move to the next position.\n> \n> After move, positions: head (2,3), then segment 1: (1,3), segment 2: old B2 (3,3), segment 3: old B3 (4,3), segment 4: old B4 (4,2), segment 5: old B5 (4,1), segment 6: old B6 (3,1), segment 7: old B7 (2,1), and tail: old T (2,2) removed? No food, so tail removed, new tail is old B7 (2,1)? Let's list:\n> \n> New positions: [(2,3), (1,3), (2,3) is head, but (1,3) is segment 1, then segment 2 should be old B1, which was (2,3), but now (2,3) is head, so segment 2 is the next, which is old B2 (3,3), then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). And tail is (2,1), since old T (2,2) is gone.\n> \n> But head is at (2,3), and segment 1 is at (1,3), different cells. Is there a body segment at (2,3)? After move, (2,3) is head, and the body includes (1,3), (3,3), etc., so (2,3) is only head, not body. Body segments are (1,3), (3,3), (4,3), etc. So no collision at (2,3).\n> \n> Moreover, moving to (2,3) is safe because it was the position of B1, but after move, B1 moves to where B2 was or something. Specifically, since the snake moves forward, the cell that was occupied by a body segment might be freed if it's the tail, but here (2,3) was not tail.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (2,3) is fine because after the move, that cell is the head, and the previous occupant has moved away.\n> \n> Similarly, in the U move, we saw it was fine.\n> \n> But in this case, for move R to (2,3), it should be allowed, and no collision.\n> \n> Current direction is L, and R is opposite, so I cannot move R because of no instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> Current direction is L (left), so opposite is R (right), so I cannot move R on this turn. So R is invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, from (1,3), possible moves: U, D, L.\n> \n> L is to (0,3) which is wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only U and D are possible.\n> \n> U to (1,4) or D to (1,2).\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the food.\n> \n> Food at (1,5) with life span 3. Since current turn is 36, it will disappear after turn 38? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Life span 3 on turn 36: it exists on turns 36,37,38, disappears on turn 39? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (1,5) with life span 3 on turn 36, it will be present on turn 36,37,38. After turn 38, it disappears, so not available on turn 39.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,1) with life span 8, present from turn 36 to 43, disappears after turn 43.\n> \n> Now, food at (4,1) is currently under the snake's body at segment B5 (4,1). So to eat it, the snake needs to move away from (4,1) and then have the head come back when it's free.\n> \n> But the head is far, at (1,3), and the snake is long, so it might be tricky.\n> \n> Food at (1,5) is at (1,5), which is above (1,4).\n> \n> Current head at (1,3), if I move U to (1,4), I'm at (1,4), then next turn I can move U to (1,5) to eat the food, but only if it's still there.\n> \n> Life span 3, so on turn 36,37,38.\n> \n> If I move U on turn 36 to (1,4), then on turn 37 I can move U to (1,5) to eat it, since turn 37 is within life span.\n> \n> Turn 36: move to (1,4), food still there? On turn 36, food at (1,5) is present.\n> \n> After move to (1,4), turn 36 ends, then turn 37: I move to (1,5), and if food is still there, I eat it.\n> \n> On turn 37, life span decreases to 2? On turn 36, life span is 3, after turn 36, it decreases to 2 for turn 37.\n> \n> Food exists as long as life span > 0, I think.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, so on turn t, life span L means it will disappear after L more turns, so available for L turns including current.\n> \n> So for (1,5), life span 3 on turn 36: available on turn 36 (L=3), turn 37 (L=2), turn 38 (L=1), gone on turn 39.\n> \n> So on turn 37, it is available with L=2.\n> \n> So if I go to (1,4) on turn 36, then to (1,5) on turn 37, I can eat it.\n> \n> But is (1,5) safe to move to?\n> \n> First, let's see if moving U on turn 36 is safe.\n> \n> Move U to (1,4): as before, new positions: head (1,4), body (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). Tail at (2,1).\n> \n> (1,4) is empty, not wall, not body, so safe.\n> \n> Then on turn 37, if I move U to (1,5), new head (1,5), and since I eat food, a new segment is added. So snake grows: head (1,5), then segment 1: (1,4), segment 2: (1,3), and so on, down to (2,1), and new tail at old tail position? When eating, the tail doesn't move, so new segment is added at the tail.\n> \n> After move to (1,5), head at (1,5), body segments: old head becomes new segment 1: (1,4), then old segment 1: (1,3), old segment 2: (2,3), ..., up to old segment 8: (2,1), and since food eaten, new segment added, so tail is now (2,1), and a new segment at the previous tail position? No.\n> \n> Standard: when food eaten, the head moves to the food, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move. Positions: new head at food, then the previous segments, and tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, on turn 37, before move, positions: head (1,4), body (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n> \n> After move U to (1,5): head to (1,5), which has food, so eaten. New head (1,5), then segment 1: previous head (1,4), segment 2: previous segment 1 (1,3), segment 3: previous segment 2 (2,3), ..., segment 9: previous segment 8 (2,1), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the end, so segment 10: previous tail position (2,1)? The tail position before move was (2,1), and since we add a new segment there, it becomes (2,1) again? Let's think.\n> \n> Typically, when no eat, tail moves away; when eat, tail stays, and body extends.\n> \n> Before move, tail is at (2,1).\n> \n> After moving head to (1,5) and eating, the new snake: head at (1,5), then the first body segment is the old head (1,4), then old segment 1 (1,3), old segment 2 (2,3), ..., old segment 8 which was the tail (2,1), and since food eaten, we add a new segment at the position where the tail was, so (2,1) now has a segment, and the tail is still at (2,1), but with an extra segment.\n> \n> Positions: new head (1,5), then:\n> \n> - Body segment 1: old head (1,4)\n> \n> - Body segment 2: old segment 1 (1,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 3: old segment 2 (2,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 4: old segment 3 (3,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 5: old segment 4 (4,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 6: old segment 5 (4,2)\n> \n> - Body segment 7: old segment 6 (4,1)\n> \n> - Body segment 8: old segment 7 (3,1)\n> \n> - Body segment 9: old segment 8 (2,1)  // which was tail\n> \n> - And new body segment 10: added at old tail position, so (2,1)? But (2,1) is already occupied by segment 9? I think I confused.\n> \n> Better: after eating, the head moves to the new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, and since food eaten, a new segment is created at the position of the old tail, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is added there.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose before move, positions are P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., Pk (tail).\n> \n> After move to new position Q (with food):\n> \n> - New head: Q\n> \n> - New segment 1: P0\n> \n> - New segment 2: P1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - New segment k: P_{k-1}\n> \n> - New segment k+1: Pk (old tail position)\n> \n> So the new tail is at Pk.\n> \n> In this case, before move on turn 37: positions H(1,4), S1(1,3), S2(2,3), S3(3,3), S4(4,3), S5(4,2), S6(4,1), S7(3,1), S8(2,1)  // S8 is tail\n> \n> After move to (1,5) and eat:\n> \n> - New head: (1,5)\n> \n> - New S1: old H (1,4)\n> \n> - New S2: old S1 (1,3)\n> \n> - New S3: old S2 (2,3)\n> \n> - New S4: old S3 (3,3)\n> \n> - New S5: old S4 (4,3)\n> \n> - New S6: old S5 (4,2)\n> \n> - New S7: old S6 (4,1)\n> \n> - New S8: old S7 (3,1)\n> \n> - New S9: old S8 (2,1)  // tail\n> \n> - And since food eaten, add new segment at old tail position (2,1), so new S10: (2,1)\n> \n> But (2,1) is now occupied by S9 and S10? That can't be; positions must be unique.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> Standard snake: when eating, the tail stays in place, so the new segment is added at the tail position, meaning that position now has the tail segment, and the previous tail is now part of body.\n> \n> Positions after move and eat: head at new position, then the entire previous snake body, including the tail, becomes the new body, and a new segment is added at the end, which is the new tail at the same position as the old tail.\n> \n> But since the tail didn't move, it's the same cell.\n> \n> In terms of cells: for example, if tail was at C, and we eat, after move, tail is still at C, and a new segment is there, so C has the new tail, and the previous segment is now the second last.\n> \n> But the cell C is occupied by the tail segment.\n> \n> In this case, before move, tail at (2,1).\n> \n> After moving head to (1,5) and eating, the new snake has head at (1,5), then the old head (1,4), then old S1 (1,3), ..., up to old S8 (2,1), and since we add a new segment, it is at (2,1), so the new tail is at (2,1), and the previous segment is old S8, but old S8 was at (2,1), so now new S9 is at (2,1), and new S10 is also at (2,1)? Conflict.\n> \n> No: the new segments are: new head at (1,5), new segment 1 at old head (1,4), new segment 2 at old S1 (1,3), new segment 3 at old S2 (2,3), ..., new segment 9 at old S8 (2,1), and then new segment 10 added at the position of the old tail, which is (2,1), so new segment 10 at (2,1). But that means two segments at (2,1), which is impossible.\n> \n> I think I have a fundamental mistake.\n> \n> Correct way: when the snake eats food, the head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but the tail does not move; it stays in place, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail.\n> \n> Positions: after moving the head to the new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, but since food is eaten, the last segment (tail) does not move; it stays, and a new segment is not added separately; rather, the tail remains, so the length increases.\n> \n> For example, suppose positions before move: H, B1, B2, T\n> \n> Move to new cell Q with food: new head at Q, new B1 at H, new B2 at B1, and new T at T (since tail doesn't move), and because of growth, there is an additional segment at the old T position, but since T stays, it's like the tail position has a segment that doesn't move.\n> \n> In terms of list: before: [H, B1, B2, T]\n> \n> After move to Q with eat: [Q, H, B1, B2, T]  // T stays, so new positions include T as part of body, and tail is still T.\n> \n> So length increased by one, tail is at T.\n> \n> In my earlier case:\n> \n> Before move on turn 37: positions [ (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1) ] let's call them P0 to P8, with P0 head (1,4), P1 (1,3), P2 (2,3), P3 (3,3), P4 (4,3), P5 (4,2), P6 (4,1), P7 (3,1), P8 (2,1) tail.\n> \n> After move U to (1,5) with eat: new head at (1,5), then new body: P0 at (1,4), P1 at (1,3), P2 at (2,3), P3 at (3,3), P4 at (4,3), P5 at (4,2), P6 at (4,1), P7 at (3,1), P8 at (2,1), and since eat, tail stays, so P8 is still at (2,1), and new tail is at (2,1).

        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 39 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(3, 2)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: U\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (4, 1, 5, 1)\n\t- (2, 2, 8, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 39 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 39. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,2). The snake is at positions: head at (1,6), then body segments at (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), and tail at (3,1). So the snake has 10 segments. Head direction is Up, which means it was moving upwards to get to (1,6).\n> \n> Now, food: there are two food items. One at (4,1) with value 1 and life span 5. Another at (2,2) with value 1 and life span 8. Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. It's 8x8? Walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacles. Internal obstacle at (3,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (1,6)\n> \n> - Body: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1)\n> \n> Tail is (3,1). From positions: index 0: (1,6) head, index 1: (1,5), index 2: (1,4), index 3: (1,3), index 4: (2,3), index 5: (3,3), index 6: (4,3), index 7: (4,2), index 8: (4,1), index 9: (3,1) tail. So 10 segments.\n> \n> Food at (4,1) and (2,2).\n> \n> (4,1) is currently occupied by the snake! Position index 8 is (4,1). But food is at (4,1) with life span 5 and value 1.\n> \n> According to the rules: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So (4,1) has food, but it's under the snake's body segment. To eat it, the body must move away, and then head must move there.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) is free, I think. Let me check if (2,2) is occupied.\n> \n> Snake positions: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1). (2,2) is not listed, so it should be empty. Obstacles: (3,2) is wall, so (2,2) should be free.\n> \n> (2,2): x=2,y=2. Walls are borders and (3,2), so (2,2) is within bounds and not occupied by snake or wall? Snake has (1,3), (2,3), etc., but not (2,2). Let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Occupied by snake: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1)\n> \n> Walls: (3,2) and borders, but borders are x=0,7 or y=0,7, so cells like (0,y) etc. are walls, but since we're playing from (1,1) to (6,6), (2,2) is at x=2,y=2, which is within 1-6, and not listed as snake or obstacle except (3,2) is obstacle, so (2,2) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,1) is under snake body.\n> \n> Head direction is Up, so last move was to (1,6) from (1,5), I assume, since it was moving up.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: I can go Up, Down, Left, Right, but cannot reverse instantly. Since head direction is Up, I cannot go Down immediately, because that would be opposite direction.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, so moving down would be reverse, which is not allowed. So possible moves: Up, Left, Right. Down is invalid.\n> \n> Head at (1,6). Possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (1,7) but y=7 is border wall, so invalid. Walls at y=7, so (1,7) is out of bounds, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down: (1,5) but (1,5) is the body segment, and it's adjacent, but since it's the body, moving there would cause collision? Let's see.\n> \n> Collision rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> (1,5) is the segment right after head, so it's the neck. Moving down to (1,5) would put head on a body cell that is not the tail, so it should be collision.\n> \n> Positions: head at (1,6), then (1,5) is next segment. If I move down to (1,5), head goes to (1,5), but (1,5) is currently occupied by the first body segment. After move, the snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to previous position.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail moves away.\n> \n> But when moving to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body segment, it's collision unless it's the tail cell.\n> \n> Specifically: if head moves to a cell that has a body segment, and that segment is not the tail, collision. If it is the tail, no collision because tail moves away.\n> \n> Here, (1,5) is the segment at index 1, which is not the tail; tail is at (3,1). So moving to (1,5) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, left: (0,6) but x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Right: (2,6) - is this free? x=2,y=6. Within bounds? x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? y=6 is not border? Borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are playable, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> (2,6): x=2, y=6, not listed as snake or wall. Snake positions: all have y<=6, but (1,6) is head, (1,5) y=5, etc. (2,6) not occupied. Obstacles: (3,2) only, so (2,6) should be free.\n> \n> Down is invalid because reverse and also body collision.\n> \n> Up invalid due to wall.\n> \n> Left invalid due to wall.\n> \n> So only possible move is Right to (2,6).\n> \n> Is that right?\n> \n> Head at (1,6). Directions:\n> \n> - U: (1,7) y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D: (1,5) which is body segment, and since not tail, collision. Invalid.\n> \n> - L: (0,6) x=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - R: (2,6) seems free.\n> \n> But is (2,6) safe? Yes, no wall, no snake, no obstacle.\n> \n> So only possible move is Right to (2,6).\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, food to consider.\n> \n> Food at (2,2) and (4,1), but (4,1) is under snake body.\n> \n> Life span: food at (4,1) has life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> \"Life-span Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 39, life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 39 + 5 - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning at the end of turn t + N - 1 or something?\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, life span L, it decreases to L-1 at end of turn, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> For food at (4,1): life span 5 at turn 39. So:\n> \n> - Turn 39: countdown 5\n> \n> - Turn 40: countdown 4\n> \n> - Turn 41: countdown 3\n> \n> - Turn 42: countdown 2\n> \n> - Turn 43: countdown 1\n> \n> - Turn 44: countdown 0, disappears? Or at turn 44, after decrease, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n> \n> Typically, it might disappear when countdown reaches 0 at the start or end of turn. But to be safe, let's assume it disappears when countdown reaches 0, so it can be eaten on the turn when countdown is still >=1.\n> \n> Similarly for (2,2): life span 8 at turn 39.\n> \n> - Turn 39: 8\n> \n> - Turn 40: 7\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Disappears when countdown reaches 0, after turn 39 + 8 - 1? Turn 46: countdown 1? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Turn t, life span L.\n> \n> After k turns, countdown = L - k.\n> \n> It disappears when countdown <=0 or when it becomes 0.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, it has countdown L, after turn t, it becomes L-1, and so on, until L-k =0, it disappears, so it can be eaten up to turn t + L -1.\n> \n> For (4,1): life span 5 at turn 39, can be eaten up to turn 39 + 5 - 1 = 43? Let's see:\n> \n> - Start turn 39: countdown=5\n> \n> - After turn 39: countdown=4 (still present)\n> \n> - After turn 40: countdown=3\n> \n> - After turn 41: countdown=2\n> \n> - After turn 42: countdown=1\n> \n> - After turn 43: countdown=0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 39 to 43? On turn 43, before the turn, countdown=1, after eating or after turn, it decreases.\n> \n> I think we need to specify when it can be eaten.\n> \n> Typically, during the turn, if head moves to food cell, it is eaten before the countdown decrease.\n> \n> But to be precise, the food is present at the start of the turn with countdown L, and if not eaten, countdown decreases at end of turn.\n> \n> If eaten, it is consumed and removed.\n> \n> For (4,1), at turn 39, present with countdown 5. If head moves to (4,1) on turn 39, it can be eaten, but currently (4,1) is occupied by body, so cannot be eaten now.\n> \n> Similarly, for (2,2), present with countdown 8.\n> \n> Back to movement.\n> \n> At turn 39, head at (1,6), only possible move is Right to (2,6), since other directions are blocked.\n> \n> Is that correct?\n> \n> Let me confirm the grid.\n> \n> x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Head (1,6): U to (1,7) y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> D to (1,5) which is snake body at index 1, not tail, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> L to (0,6) x=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> R to (2,6): let's check if occupied. Snake: positions are (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1). None at (2,6). Walls: borders and (3,2), so (2,6) is free. So only possible move is R to (2,6).\n> \n> So for turn 39, I must go Right.\n> \n> Then after moving, snake head at (2,6), and the body moves: the segment that was at (1,5) moves to (1,6), which was head position, but since head moved, the body follows.\n> \n> New positions: head at (2,6), then body: first segment to old head position (1,6), then (1,5) to (1,5)?

        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 40 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(3, 2)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(2, 6), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: R\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (4, 1, 4, 1)\n\t- (2, 2, 7, 1)\n\t- (2, 6, 10, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 39 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 39. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,2). The snake is at positions: head at (1,6), then body segments at (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), and tail at (3,1). So the snake has 10 segments. Head direction is Up, which means it was moving upwards to get to (1,6).\n> \n> Now, food: there are two food items. One at (4,1) with value 1 and life span 5. Another at (2,2) with value 1 and life span 8. Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. It's 8x8? Walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacles. Internal obstacle at (3,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (1,6)\n> \n> - Body: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1)\n> \n> Tail is (3,1). From positions: index 0: (1,6) head, index 1: (1,5), index 2: (1,4), index 3: (1,3), index 4: (2,3), index 5: (3,3), index 6: (4,3), index 7: (4,2), index 8: (4,1), index 9: (3,1) tail. So 10 segments.\n> \n> Food at (4,1) and (2,2).\n> \n> (4,1) is currently occupied by the snake! Position index 8 is (4,1). But food is at (4,1) with life span 5 and value 1.\n> \n> According to the rules: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So (4,1) has food, but it's under the snake's body segment. To eat it, the body must move away, and then head must move there.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) is free, I think. Let me check if (2,2) is occupied.\n> \n> Snake positions: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1). (2,2) is not listed, so it should be empty. Obstacles: (3,2) is wall, so (2,2) should be free.\n> \n> (2,2): x=2,y=2. Walls are borders and (3,2), so (2,2) is within bounds and not occupied by snake or wall? Snake has (1,3), (2,3), etc., but not (2,2). Let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Occupied by snake: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1)\n> \n> Walls: (3,2) and borders, but borders are x=0,7 or y=0,7, so cells like (0,y) etc. are walls, but since we're playing from (1,1) to (6,6), (2,2) is at x=2,y=2, which is within 1-6, and not listed as snake or obstacle except (3,2) is obstacle, so (2,2) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,1) is under snake body.\n> \n> Head direction is Up, so last move was to (1,6) from (1,5), I assume, since it was moving up.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: I can go Up, Down, Left, Right, but cannot reverse instantly. Since head direction is Up, I cannot go Down immediately, because that would be opposite direction.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, so moving down would be reverse, which is not allowed. So possible moves: Up, Left, Right. Down is invalid.\n> \n> Head at (1,6). Possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (1,7) but y=7 is border wall, so invalid. Walls at y=7, so (1,7) is out of bounds, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down: (1,5) but (1,5) is the body segment, and it's adjacent, but since it's the body, moving there would cause collision? Let's see.\n> \n> Collision rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> (1,5) is the segment right after head, so it's the neck. Moving down to (1,5) would put head on a body cell that is not the tail, so it should be collision.\n> \n> Positions: head at (1,6), then (1,5) is next segment. If I move down to (1,5), head goes to (1,5), but (1,5) is currently occupied by the first body segment. After move, the snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to previous position.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail moves away.\n> \n> But when moving to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body segment, it's collision unless it's the tail cell.\n> \n> Specifically: if head moves to a cell that has a body segment, and that segment is not the tail, collision. If it is the tail, no collision because tail moves away.\n> \n> Here, (1,5) is the segment at index 1, which is not the tail; tail is at (3,1). So moving to (1,5) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, left: (0,6) but x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Right: (2,6) - is this free? x=2,y=6. Within bounds? x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? y=6 is not border? Borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are playable, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> (2,6): x=2, y=6, not listed as snake or wall. Snake positions: all have y<=6, but (1,6) is head, (1,5) y=5, etc. (2,6) not occupied. Obstacles: (3,2) only, so (2,6) should be free.\n> \n> Down is invalid because reverse and also body collision.\n> \n> Up invalid due to wall.\n> \n> Left invalid due to wall.\n> \n> So only possible move is Right to (2,6).\n> \n> Is that right?\n> \n> Head at (1,6). Directions:\n> \n> - U: (1,7) y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D: (1,5) which is body segment, and since not tail, collision. Invalid.\n> \n> - L: (0,6) x=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - R: (2,6) seems free.\n> \n> But is (2,6) safe? Yes, no wall, no snake, no obstacle.\n> \n> So only possible move is Right to (2,6).\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, food to consider.\n> \n> Food at (2,2) and (4,1), but (4,1) is under snake body.\n> \n> Life span: food at (4,1) has life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> \"Life-span Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 39, life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 39 + 5 - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning at the end of turn t + N - 1 or something?\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, life span L, it decreases to L-1 at end of turn, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> For food at (4,1): life span 5 at turn 39. So:\n> \n> - Turn 39: countdown 5\n> \n> - Turn 40: countdown 4\n> \n> - Turn 41: countdown 3\n> \n> - Turn 42: countdown 2\n> \n> - Turn 43: countdown 1\n> \n> - Turn 44: countdown 0, disappears? Or at turn 44, after decrease, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n> \n> Typically, it might disappear when countdown reaches 0 at the start or end of turn. But to be safe, let's assume it disappears when countdown reaches 0, so it can be eaten on the turn when countdown is still >=1.\n> \n> Similarly for (2,2): life span 8 at turn 39.\n> \n> - Turn 39: 8\n> \n> - Turn 40: 7\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Disappears when countdown reaches 0, after turn 39 + 8 - 1? Turn 46: countdown 1? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Turn t, life span L.\n> \n> After k turns, countdown = L - k.\n> \n> It disappears when countdown <=0 or when it becomes 0.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, it has countdown L, after turn t, it becomes L-1, and so on, until L-k =0, it disappears, so it can be eaten up to turn t + L -1.\n> \n> For (4,1): life span 5 at turn 39, can be eaten up to turn 39 + 5 - 1 = 43? Let's see:\n> \n> - Start turn 39: countdown=5\n> \n> - After turn 39: countdown=4 (still present)\n> \n> - After turn 40: countdown=3\n> \n> - After turn 41: countdown=2\n> \n> - After turn 42: countdown=1\n> \n> - After turn 43: countdown=0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 39 to 43? On turn 43, before the turn, countdown=1, after eating or after turn, it decreases.\n> \n> I think we need to specify when it can be eaten.\n> \n> Typically, during the turn, if head moves to food cell, it is eaten before the countdown decrease.\n> \n> But to be precise, the food is present at the start of the turn with countdown L, and if not eaten, countdown decreases at end of turn.\n> \n> If eaten, it is consumed and removed.\n> \n> For (4,1), at turn 39, present with countdown 5. If head moves to (4,1) on turn 39, it can be eaten, but currently (4,1) is occupied by body, so cannot be eaten now.\n> \n> Similarly, for (2,2), present with countdown 8.\n> \n> Back to movement.\n> \n> At turn 39, head at (1,6), only possible move is Right to (2,6), since other directions are blocked.\n> \n> Is that correct?\n> \n> Let me confirm the grid.\n> \n> x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Head (1,6): U to (1,7) y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> D to (1,5) which is snake body at index 1, not tail, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> L to (0,6) x=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> R to (2,6): let's check if occupied. Snake: positions are (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1). None at (2,6). Walls: borders and (3,2), so (2,6) is free. So only possible move is R to (2,6).\n> \n> So for turn 39, I must go Right.\n> \n> Then after moving, snake head at (2,6), and the body moves: the segment that was at (1,5) moves to (1,6), which was head position, but since head moved, the body follows.\n> \n> New positions: head at (2,6), then body: first segment to old head position (1,6), then (1,5) to (1,5)?

There's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (2,5), and the body segments are (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2). So the snake has 10 segments. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning moving downwards, so increasing y? No, in coordinates, typically y increases upwards, but in this context, let's check the movement definitions.\n> \n> Movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So U increases y, D decreases y. So y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But walls are y=0 and y=7, so probably y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> Head direction is D, down, so decreasing y. Current head is at (2,5), and since it's moving down, previous position was above it? Snake positions list: head (2,5), then (2,6), which is above it since y=6 > y=5? Positions: (2,5) head, then (2,6), (1,6), etc.\n> \n> (2,5) to (2,6): from (2,6) to (2,5) is moving down?

Since (2,6) has higher y, and head is at (2,5) with direction D, meaning it just moved down to (2,5) from (2,6)? Let's think.\n> \n> The snake positions are listed from head to tail. So head is at (2,5), then the body segments follow. The first body segment is (2,6), which is directly above the head since y=6 > y=5? In standard coordinates, higher y is up, so (2,6) is north of (2,5).\n> \n> But head direction is D, down. That means the snake was previously at (2,6) and moved down to (2,5), so the head is now at (2,5) after moving down. So the previous head position was (2,6), and it moved to (2,5).\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (2,2) with value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> (2,6) is a food position, but (2,6) is also occupied by the snake's first body segment? Snake positions include (2,6) as the first body segment after head.\n> \n> According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n> \n> So (2,6) has food, but it's currently under the snake body. To eat it, the snake needs to move such that the body leaves (2,6), and later the head moves there.\n> \n> But (2,6) is the position right after head, so when the snake moves, the body will move away from (2,6) only if the head doesn't go back, but let's see the movement.\n> \n> I need to plan the next moves. I have to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

No instant reverse means I cannot move opposite to current direction on the next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up). So on the next turn, turn 41, I cannot move U, because that would be instant reverse.\n> \n> Allowed moves: since direction is D, I can move D (down), L (left), or R (right), but not U.\n> \n> Now from (2,5):\n> \n> - Down: (2,4)\n> \n> - Left: (1,5)\n> \n> - Right: (3,5)\n> \n> But I need to check if these are valid, no walls or obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7.

Countdown decreases to 0 at turn 44? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> And \"disappears after N turns\" – I think it means that at the start of turn t, if life span is L, then after L turns, it disappears.

It's turn 41. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (2,5), and the body segments are (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2). So the snake has 10 segments. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning moving downwards, so increasing y? No, in coordinates, typically y increases upwards, but in this context, let's check the movement definitions.\n> \n> Movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So U increases y, D decreases y. So y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But walls are y=0 and y=7, so probably y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> Head direction is D, down, so decreasing y. Current head is at (2,5), and since it's moving down, previous position was above it? Snake positions list: head (2,5), then (2,6), which is above it since y=6 > y=5? Positions: (2,5) head, then (2,6), (1,6), etc.\n> \n> (2,5) to (2,6): from (2,6) to (2,5) is moving down?

Since (2,6) has higher y, and head is at (2,5) with direction D, meaning it just moved down to (2,5) from (2,6)? Let's think.\n> \n> The snake positions are listed from head to tail. So head is at (2,5), then the body segments follow. The first body segment is (2,6), which is directly above the head since y=6 > y=5? In standard coordinates, higher y is up, so (2,6) is north of (2,5).\n> \n> But head direction is D, down. That means the snake was previously at (2,6) and moved down to (2,5), so the head is now at (2,5) after moving down. So the previous head position was (2,6), and it moved to (2,5).\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (2,2) with value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> (2,6) is a food position, but (2,6) is also occupied by the snake's first body segment? Snake positions include (2,6) as the first body segment after head.\n> \n> According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n> \n> So (2,6) has food, but it's currently under the snake body. To eat it, the snake needs to move such that the body leaves (2,6), and later the head moves there.\n> \n> But (2,6) is the position right after head, so when the snake moves, the body will move away from (2,6) only if the head doesn't go back, but let's see the movement.\n> \n> I need to plan the next moves.

No instant reverse means I cannot move opposite to current direction on the next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up).

6: (2,3), 7: (3,3), 8: (4,3), 9: (4,2)\n> \n> So (2,6) is index 1.\n> \n> When the snake moves, if the head moves to a new cell, index 1 moves to old index 0, index 2 to old index 1, etc.\n> \n> So the cell (2,6) is always occupied by index 1 or whatever index shifts to it.\n> \n> Specifically, after each move, the cell that was old index 1 is now new index 2 position, but the cell (2,6) is the position, not the index.\n> \n> The physical cell (2,6) is currently occupied by the segment at index 1.\n> \n> After a move, if the head moves to (2,4), for example, then new index 1 is at (2,5), new

Head direction is down, which is D, meaning moving downwards, so increasing y? No, in coordinates, typically y increases upwards, but in this context, let's check the movement definitions.\n> \n> Movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So U increases y, D decreases y. So y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But walls are y=0 and y=7, so probably y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> Head direction is D, down, so decreasing y. Current head is at (2,5), and since it's moving down, previous position was above it? Snake positions list: head (2,5), then (2,6), which is above it since y=6 > y=5?

Since (2,6) has higher y, and head is at (2,5) with direction D, meaning it just moved down to (2,5) from (2,6)? Let's think.\n> \n> The snake positions are listed from head to tail. So head is at (2,5), then the body segments follow. The first body segment is (2,6), which is directly above the head since y=6 > y=5? In standard coordinates, higher y is up, so (2,6) is north of (2,5).\n> \n> But head direction is D, down. That means the snake was previously at (2,6) and moved down to (2,5), so the head is now at (2,5) after moving down. So the previous head position was (2,6), and it moved to (2,5).\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (2,2) with value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> (2,6) is a food position, but (2,6) is also occupied by the snake's first body segment? Snake positions include (2,6) as the first body segment after head.\n> \n> According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n> \n> So (2,6) has food, but it's currently under the snake body. To eat it, the snake needs to move such that the body leaves (2,6), and later the head moves there.\n> \n> But (2,6) is the position right after head, so when the snake moves, the body will move away from (2,6) only if the head doesn't go back, but let's see the movement.\n> \n> I need to plan the next moves.

Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 41, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 43? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? For example, if L=1, it disappears at the end of this turn, so can be eaten only this turn.\n> \n> Generally, it can be eaten on turns when countdown >0, and disappears after countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> But countdown decreases each turn, so for food at (4,1): life span 3 at turn 41, so:\n> \n> - Turn 41: countdown 3, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn 42: countdown 2, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn 43: countdown 1, can be eaten\n> \n> - After turn 43, disappears? Countdown decreases to 0 at turn 44? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> And \"disappears after N turns\" – I think it means that at the start of turn t, if life span is L, then after L turns, it disappears. But since countdown decreases each turn, including current, after decreasing L times, it reaches 0 and disappears.\n> \n> So for turn t, with life span L:\n> \n> - At the beginning of turn t, countdown = L\n> \n> - After the turn, countdown decreases to L-1 for next turn? The countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think: during turn t, the food has remaining life span R, and after the turn, R decreases by 1.\n> \n> If R=1 at start of turn, it can be eaten during that turn, and after that, it disappears.\n> \n> If not eaten, after the turn, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, if R=2 at start, it can be eaten during turn, and after, R=1 for next turn.\n> \n> Standard way: at the start of turn, life span is given, and it decreases by 1 at the end of the turn. If decreased to 0, it disappears.\n> \n> For this food: at turn 41, life span 3, so:\n> \n> - Turn 41: can be eaten, after turn, life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 42: can be eaten, after turn, life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 43: can be eaten, after turn, life span 0, disappears\n> \n> - So not available on turn 44.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2): life span 6 at turn 41, so available until turn 46? Life span 6, decreases each turn.\n> \n> - Turn 41: LS=6\n> \n> - After turn 41: LS=5 (for turn 42)\n> \n> - Turn 42: LS=5\n> \n> - After turn 42: LS=4\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn 46: LS=0, disappears, so not available turn 47.\n> \n> Available from turn 41 to 46 inclusive? At turn 46, LS=1, can be eaten, then after disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6): life span 9 at turn 41, so available until turn 49.\n> \n> Now, (2,6) is currently occupied by snake body, so it can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there later.\n> \n> Also, there's a special rule: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, I need to plan moves.\n> \n> From head at (2,5), direction D, so at turn 41, I can move D, L, or R.\n> \n> - Move D to (2,4)\n> \n> - Move L to (1,5) but (1,5) is occupied by body, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> - Move R to (3,5)\n> \n> - Move U not allowed, reverse.\n> \n> So only possible moves: D to (2,4) or R to (3,5)\n> \n> Now, let's evaluate these options.\n> \n> First, move D to (2,4):\n> \n> After moving, snake head to (2,4), body: the tail end moves?

It must be eaten by turn 43, but I can't reach it in time.\n> \n> Therefore, I should ignore (4,1) and focus on other food.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) has life span 6, so available until turn 46.\n> \n> (2,6) has life span 9.\n> \n> Now, (2,6) is under body, so I need to free it.\n> \n> How to free (2,6).\n> \n> Currently occupied by body segment.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the body at (2,6) will move to the old head position if head moves away.\n> \n> But at turn 41, head is at (2,5), if I move down to (2,4), then the body at (2,6) moves to (2,5), so (2,6) is free? No.\n> \n> After move down to (2,4), new positions: head (2,4), seg1 (2,5), seg2 (2,6) — seg2 is at (2,6), so still occupied.\n> \n> If I move right to (3,5), head to (3,5), seg1 to (2,5), seg2 to (2,6), still occupied.\n> \n> To free (2,6), I need the head to move in a way that the segment that is at (2,6) moves to a different position.\n> \n> Currently, the segment at index 1 is at (2,6).\n> \n> When head moves, this segment will move to the current head position (2,5), only if the head moves to a new position.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to (2,4) or (3,5), the segment that was at (2,6) will move to (2,5), so the cell (2,6) is vacated only if no other segment moves there, but in this case, after the move, the new seg2 is at (2,6), which is the same cell.\n> \n> The cell (2,6) is occupied by the second segment before and after, so it doesn't free up.\n> \n> The only way to free (2,6) is to have the snake move such that the body part at (2,6) is not followed by another segment staying there, but since it's a chain, when the head moves, the body shifts, so the position (2,6) will be occupied by the next segment unless the snake turns.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves left, but left is occupied, invalid.\n> \n> Or if later, when the snake bends, it might free up.\n> \n> Specifically, (2,6) can be freed if the head moves in a direction that causes the body to not occupy (2,6) after the move.\n> \n> Suppose at turn 41, I move right to (3,5).\n> \n> Then as above, seg2 is at (2,6).\n> \n> Now from there, on turn 42, I can move, say, up to (3,6), but (3,6) is free, and direction was R, U is not reverse, so allowed.\n> \n> Move U to (3,6), then head to (3,6), new seg1 to (3,5), new seg2 to (2,5), new seg3 to (2,6), etc.\n> \n> New positions: head (3,6), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (2,6), seg4 (1,6), etc.\n> \n> So now seg3 is at (2,6), still occupied.\n> \n> If from (3,5) I move down to (3,4), then head (3,4), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (2,6), same.\n> \n> So (2,6) remains occupied because it's early in the body.\n> \n> To free (2,6), I need the snake to move so that the segment at (2,6) moves away and no segment comes back immediately.\n> \n> For example, if I can move the head in a way that the body at (2,6) moves to (2,5) or something, but (2,6) is fixed in position until the snake moves in a different direction.\n> \n> Perhaps I need to wait for the snake to progress so that (2,6) becomes closer to the tail.\n> \n> Currently, the tail is at (4,2), so (2,6) is near the head.\n> \n> As the snake moves, the position (2,6) will be occupied until the tail passes, but since the snake is long, it might take time.\n> \n> Let's list the body positions: indices from head: 0: (2,5), 1: (2,6), 2: (1,6), 3: (1,5), 4: (1,4), 5: (1,3), 6: (2,3), 7: (3,3), 8: (4,3), 9: (4,2)\n> \n> So (2,6) is index 1.\n> \n> When the snake moves, if the head moves to a new cell, index 1 moves to old index 0, index 2 to old index 1, etc.\n> \n> So the cell (2,6) is always occupied by index 1 or whatever index shifts to it.\n> \n> Specifically, after each move, the cell that was old index 1 is now new index 2 position, but the cell (2,6) is the position, not the index.\n> \n> The physical cell (2,6) is currently occupied by the segment at index 1.\n> \n> After a move, if the head moves to (2,4), for example, then new index 1 is at (2,5), new index 2 is at (2,6), so cell (2,6) is still occupied by new index 2.\n> \n> Similarly, if head moves to (3,5), new index 1 at (2,5), new index 2 at (2,6), same.\n> \n> So the cell (2,6) remains occupied by a body segment until the snake moves in a way that the segment that was at (2,6) moves to a different cell and no other segment moves to (2,6).\n> \n> For that to happen, the head must move in a direction that causes the body to turn, but at (2,6), it's connected to (2,5) and (1,6), so if the head moves, say, left, but left is occupied.\n> \n> Perhaps later, when the snake moves, the position (2,6) might be vacated if the body moves down or something.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves down to (2,4), then as before, only choice is to move right to (3,4) on turn 42.\n> \n> Then from (3,4), I can move to (2,4) or (4,4), say (4,4).\n> \n> Then head to (4,4), body (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), etc. still (2,6) occupied.\n> \n> It seems difficult to free (2,6) soon.\n> \n> Since (2,6) has life span 9, I have time, so I can focus on other food.\n> \n> Food at (2,2) with value 1, life span 6, so can be eaten until turn 46.\n> \n> (2,2) is at the bottom left.\n> \n> Current head at (2,5), so down to (2,4), then to (2,3) but (2,3) is occupied.\n> \n> After some moves, it might be free.\n> \n> Let's consider the move options.\n> \n> At turn 41, if I move down to (2,4), then at turn 42, only possible move is right to (3,4), as we saw earlier.\n> \n> Then from (3,4), I can move left to (2,4) or right to (4,4).\n> \n> (2,4) might be free or not.\n> \n> After

Body segments follow as listed.\n- **Food**: \n  - (2,2): Value +1, life span 4 (available until turn 47)\n  - (2,6): Value +1, life span 6 (available until turn 49) - currently under body segment\n  - (1,1): Value +1, life span 9 (available until turn 52)\n- **Constraints**:\n  - Cannot move left (opposite of current direction R).\n  - Must avoid walls (borders at x=0/7, y=0/7) and internal obstacle (3,2).\n  - Must avoid colliding with body segments (except tail, which moves away).\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **Right (R) to (5,4)**:\n   - Check: (5,4) is within bounds (x=5,y=4), not a wall or obstacle.\n   - Not occupied by any body segment (current body segments are all elsewhere).\n   - Safe move.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (4,5)**:\n   - Check: (4,5) is within bounds, not a wall or obstacle.\n   - Not occupied by any body segment.\n   - Safe move.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (4,3)**:\n   - Check: (4,3) is within bounds, not a wall or obstacle.\n   - Not occupied by any body segment.\n   - Safe move.\n\n### Food Considerations:\n- **(2,6)**: Currently under body segment. Cannot be eaten immediately (must wait for body to move away).\n- **(2,2) and (1,1)**: Accessible but require multiple moves to reach. Not immediately relevant for the current turn.\n\n### Immediate Goal:\n- Avoid collisions and set up for future food collection. Since no food is immediately reachable, prioritize moves that keep the snake safe and flexible.\n\n### Best Move:\n- **Right (R) to (5,4)**:\n  - Moves the snake away from the coiled body, reducing immediate collision risks.\n  - Keeps options open for future moves (can go up/down next turn).\n  - Avoids trapping the snake in a corner or near walls.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

It's turn 44, and I'm playing Snake on a grid from (0,0) to (7,7), since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (4,4), then body segments at (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), and tail at (2,3). So the snake is 10 segments long.\n> \n> The head direction is R, meaning it was moving right to get to (4,4) from (3,4). Since it moved to (4,4), which is to the right of (3,4), direction is R.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (2,2) with value 1 and life span 4 (so it disappears after 4 turns, including this one? Life span decreases every turn, so if life span is 4 at turn 44, it will disappear after turn 47? Let's clarify: \"life-span disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 44, life span 4 means it will disappear at the end of turn 47? Countdown: at turn 44, countdown=4, after turn 44 it becomes 3, after turn 45 it becomes 2, after turn 46 it becomes 1, after turn 47 it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten until turn 47, and disappears before turn 48. Similarly for others.\n> \n> - Food at (2,6) with value 1 and life span 6. So countdown from 6 at turn 44, disappears after turn 49? Turn 44:6, 45:5, 46:4, 47:3, 48:2, 49:1, 50:0 gone. Life span N, disappears after N turns, meaning after N turns it's gone. \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means that it will be gone at the start of turn t + N or something. Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". For example, if N=1 at turn t, it disappears after that turn, so it's there at turn t but gone by turn t+1. If N=2 at turn t, it decreases to 1 at turn t+1, then to 0 at turn t+2, gone by turn t+3? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard way: at turn t, if life span is L, then after L turns, it disappears. Meaning, it is present for L more turns, including the current one? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, countdown is C, then after turn t, C becomes C-1, and when C=0, it disappears. So for food at (2,2): C=4 at turn 44. After turn 44, C=3; after turn 45, C=2; after turn 46, C=1; after turn 47, C=0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 44,45,46,47. Similarly, (2,6) C=6 at turn 44, can be eaten until turn 49 (since after turn 49, C=0 gone). And (1,1) C=9, can be eaten until turn 52.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all are positive food.\n> \n> Now, I need to move the snake. Current head at (4,4), direction R. Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move left immediately. So possible moves: U, D, R. L is not allowed because it would be instant reverse.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid walls and body collisions, but since the tail moves, head can go to where tail is now, because tail will move away.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid. Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and (3,2) is obstacle.\n> \n> Snake positions: list them:\n> \n> - Head: (4,4)\n> \n> - Body: (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)\n> \n> So tail is (2,3).\n> \n> Now, food at: (2,2), (2,6), (1,1)\n> \n> (2,6) is a food position, but (2,6) is also occupied by the snake body? Let's see: snake has (2,6) as one of the positions. Positions: (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)\n> \n> So (2,6) is the fifth segment, so it's occupied by the snake body. But food can spawn under the body, which is the case here. Food at (2,6) is under the snake body.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods: (2,2) is empty, (1,1) is empty.\n> \n> For food under body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it. So for (2,6), since it's under a body segment, not the head, we need that segment to move away, and then head to move there.\n> \n> But (2,6) is not the tail; tail is (2,3). So when the snake moves, the body will shift.\n> \n> I need to think about the movement.\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide. But in this case, tail is at (2,3), head at (4,4), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (4,4) adjacent to (4,3),(4,5),(3,4),(5,4), but (5,4) might be out or not, but (3,4) is body, not tail. Tail is (2,3), which is not adjacent to (4,4). Distance: |4-2|=2, |4-3|=1, not adjacent. So no issue now.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan 5+ turns ahead to maximize score with long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's see possible moves from (4,4):\n> \n> - U: to (4,5)\n> \n> - D: to (4,3)\n> \n> - R: to (5,4)\n> \n> L not allowed.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> - (4,5): is it wall or body? Walls: borders are walls, so y=0 and y=7 are walls, x=0 and x=7 are walls. (4,5): x=4, y=5, not border. Internal obstacle at (3,2), not here. Snake body: positions include (3,5), (2,5), etc., but (4,5) is not in the list. List: (4,4) is head, (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3). So (4,5) is free? (4,5) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3): not border, not obstacle, not in snake positions?

When snake moves, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So at turn 44, positions: head (4,4), then segments: 1:(3,4), 2:(3,5), 3:(2,5), 4:(2,6), 5:(1,6), 6:(1,5), 7:(1,4), 8:(1,3), 9:(2,3) — let's index for clarity.\n> \n> Define: at turn t, snake positions: S0 = head (4,4), S1 = (3,4), S2 = (3,5), S3 = (2,5), S4 = (2,6), S5 = (1,6), S6 = (1,5), S7 = (1,4), S8 = (1,3), S9 = tail (2,3).\n> \n> When snake moves in a direction, new head is based on move, and each body segment takes position of the previous one, so tail position is vacated.\n> \n> For example, if I move right to (5,4), then new positions: head (5,4), then S0 was (4,4) now body1, S1 was (3,4) now body2, ..., up to S8 was (2,3) now body9, and S9 tail is gone, so new tail is the previous S8 position? Let's see:\n> \n> After move, new head: (5,4)\n> \n> Then body segments: segment 1: old head (4,4), segment 2: old S1 (3,4), segment 3: old S2 (3,5), segment 4: old S3 (2,5), segment 5: old S4 (2,6), segment 6: old S5 (1,6), segment 7: old S6 (1,5), segment 8: old S7 (1,4), segment 9: old S8 (1,3), and tail: old S9 (2,3) is removed? No.\n> \n> The snake has 10 segments, so when head moves to new cell, the tail cell is left, so the snake grows only when eating food. Without eating, the tail moves, so the snake occupies the new head and all body segments shift forward, tail is removed.\n> \n> So after move without eating: new head at new position, body segments: segment i is at old segment i-1 position for i=1 to 9, and tail (segment 9) is at old segment 8 position? Better to think indices.\n> \n> Let positions at turn t: P0, P1, P2, ..., P9 where P0 head, P9 tail.\n> \n> After move to new head position H_new, the new positions are: H_new, P0, P1, P2, ..., P8.\n> \n> So the new tail is P8, and P9 is vacated.\n> \n> In this case, after move, if no food eaten, snake has same length, positions: new head, then old head, then old S1, ..., old S8.\n> \n> Old S9 is left.\n> \n> Specifically for us:\n> \n> Current: P0=(4,4), P1=(3,4), P2=(3,5), P3=(2,5), P4=(2,6), P5=(1,6), P6=(1,5), P7=(1,4), P8=(1,3), P9=(2,3)\n> \n> If move to (5,4) (R), new positions: head (5,4), then P0=(4,4), P1=(3,4), P2=(3,5), P3=(2,5), P4=(2,6), P5=(1,6), P6=(1,5), P7=(1,4), P8=(1,3), and P9=(2,3) is gone, so tail is now at (1,3), which was old P8.\n> \n> New tail is old P8, which is (1,3).\n> \n> Similarly, if move U to (4,5): new head (4,5), then (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), tail at (1,3)? Old P8 is (1,3), new positions: head (4,5), body1: (4,4), body2: (3,4), body3: (3,5), body4: (2,5), body5: (2,6), body6: (1,6), body7: (1,5), body8: (1,4), tail: (1,3) — but old P9 was (2,3), which is vacated.\n> \n> In new list, position after U: (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — so tail at (1,3).\n> \n> Similarly for D to (4,3): new head (4,3), then (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), tail at (1,3).\n> \n> In all cases, the new tail is at (1,3), since old P8 was (1,3).\n> \n> Now, food at (2,6) is under current P4.

New body4 is old P3 (2,5), new body5 is old P4 (2,6), so (2,6) is still occupied by body, specifically new body5.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move R: new body5 is old P4 (2,6), so still occupied.\n> \n> If I move D, same.\n> \n> So immediately after move, (2,6) is still occupied because the segment that was there is now the previous segment, but since body shifts, the cell (2,6) might be reoccupied if the segment stays, but in this case, when moving, the segment that was at (2,6) moves to the position of old P3, which is (2,5)? Let's clarify.\n> \n> In the shift, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n> \n> For cell (2,6), it was occupied by P4. After move, P4 new position is old P3 position, which is (2,5). So the cell (2,6) is vacated only if no new segment moves there, but in the new positions, who is at (2,6)? New body5 is at old P4 position, which is (2,6), but old P4 is now new body5, and new body5 is at old P4 position, which is (2,6), so (2,6) is still occupied by new body5.\n> \n> For example, after move U: new head (4,5), new body1: old P0 (4,4), new body2: old P1 (3,4), new body3: old P2 (3,5), new body4: old P3 (2,5), new body5: old P4 (2,6), new body6: old P5 (1,6), etc. So (2,6) is now occupied by new body5, which is the same as old P4, so the food is still under the body.\n> \n> To eat the food at (2,6), we need the body to move away from it, meaning that the segment occupying it moves, and no other segment moves there immediately, so the cell is free, then head can move there later.\n> \n> Since the snake moves one step at a time, the cell (2,6) will be vacated when the segment that is there moves to a different position.\n> \n> In the current state, P4 is at (2,6). When the snake moves, P4 new position is old P3 position, which is (2,5), so it moves to (2,5). Then the new position for what was P4 is now at (2,5), so (2,6) is vacated only if no other part moves there. But in the new positions, new body5 is at old P4 position (2,6), but since P4 moved to (2,5), the cell (2,6) is now empty because new body5 is defined as at old P4 position, but old P4 position is (2,6), so new body5 is at (2,6), so it's still occupied.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Let's think of the grid cells.\n> \n> At turn t, cell (2,6) is occupied by the snake body segment at P4.\n> \n> After a move, the segment that was at P4 is now at the position that was P3, so it has moved to (2,5).\n> \n> The cell (2,6) is now empty because no segment is assigned to it anymore. The new body segment that occupies (2,6) is not there; the new body positions are based on the old positions shifted.\n> \n> After move, the new body segments are at the old positions of the previous segments.\n> \n> Specifically, new body1 is at old P0 position, new body2 at old P1 position, etc., up to new body9 at old P8 position.\n> \n> For cell (2,6), it was old P4 position. After move, new body5 is at old P4 position, which is (2,6), so new body5 is at (2,6). Therefore, (2,6) is still occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> The segment that was there is now elsewhere, but the cell is still occupied by a different segment.\n> \n> In terms of the grid, the cell (2,6) remains occupied because the body part that was P4 is now at (2,5), but the body part that was P5 is now at old P5 position? No.\n> \n> Let's list old positions and new positions after a move.\n> \n> Old positions:\n> - P0: (4,4)\n> - P1: (3,4)\n> - P2: (3,5)\n> - P3: (2,5)\n> - P4: (2,6)\n> - P5: (1,6)\n> - P6: (1,5)\n> - P7: (1,4)\n> - P8: (1,3)\n> - P9: (2,3)\n> \n> After move, say U to (4,5):\n> - New head: (4,5)\n> - New body1: old P0 = (4,4)\n> - New body2: old P1 = (3,4)\n> - New body3: old P2 = (3,5)\n> - New body4: old P3 = (2,5)\n> - New body5: old P4 = (2,6)\n> - New body6: old P5 = (1,6)\n> - New body7: old P6 = (1,5)\n> - New body8: old P7 = (1,4)\n> - New body9: old P8 = (1,3)  -- new tail\n> \n> Old P9 (2,3) is vacated.\n> \n> So cell (2,6) is occupied by new body5, which is at (2,6).\n> \n> Similarly, for any move, the cell (2,6) will be occupied by the new body5, which is at old P4 position, so it stays occupied until the snake moves in a way that this position changes.\n> \n> To vacate (2,6), we need the body to move so that no segment is at (2,6) after the shift. That means that the segment that is currently at P4 must move, and the position (2,6) should not be the new position for any body part.\n> \n> In the shift, the only way (2,6) is vacated is if it is not the position of any new body segment. But since new body5 is always at old P4 position, which is (2,6), it will be occupied as long as the snake has that many segments.\n> \n> Unless the snake eats food and grows, but for now, length is fixed.\n> \n> So (2,6) will remain occupied by the body until the snake moves in a way that the body part leaves it, but due to the shift, it's always occupied by the same \"logical\" segment or its position.\n> \n> Actually, the cell (2,6) is occupied by a body segment as long as that part of the body doesn't move away, but when the snake moves, the segment moves to a new position, so the cell is vacated, but immediately reoccupied by the next segment in line? No.\n> \n> In the example above, when snake moves U, the segment that was at P4 moves to new position (2,5) (which was old P3), so it leaves (2,6). Then the cell (2,6) is not occupied by that segment anymore. But in the new positions, new body5 is at (2,6), which is the position where old P4 was, but old P4 is now at (2,5), so the body part that was at P4 is now at (2,5), and the body part that was at P5 is now at old P5 position, which is (1,6), so for cell (2,6), after the move, it is occupied by new body5, but new body5 is the segment that was old P4, and it is at (2,6)? No.\n> \n> New body5 is at old P4 position, which is (2,6), and new body5 is the segment that was old P4, so the same segment is now at (2,6) again? I'm messing up.\n> \n> Let's label the segments.\n> \n> Denote the segments: S0 head, S1, S2, ..., S9 tail.\n> \n> At time t, positions: S0: (4,4), S1: (3,4), S2: (3,5), S3: (2,5), S4: (2,6), S5: (1,6), S6: (1,5), S7: (1,4), S8: (1,3), S9: (2,3)\n> \n> After moving U, new head is at (4,5).\n> \n> Then, the new body segments are: the segment that was S0 is now body1 at (4,4), the segment that was S1 is now body2 at (3,4), the segment that was S2 is now body3 at (3,5), the segment that was S3 is now body4 at (2,5), the segment that was S4 is now body5 at (2,6), the segment that was S5 is now body6 at (1,6), the segment that was S6 is now body7 at (1,5), the segment that was S7 is now body8 at (1,4), the segment that was S8 is now body9 at (1,3), and the segment that was S9 is gone.\n> \n> So for cell (2,6), it was occupied by S4 at time t. At time t+1, it is occupied by the same segment S4, which is now body5 at (2,6). So the cell is still occupied by the same snake part.\n> \n> The position didn't change for that segment; it stayed at (2,6).\n> \n> But when the snake moved, the head moved, but this body segment didn't move because the segments behind it moved, but in this case, since the head moved up, the body segments shift, but S4 was at (2,6), and after move, it is still at (2,6) because it became body5 at the same position.\n> \n> In terms of movement, S4 did not change position; it stayed.\n> \n> Only the head and the segments before it moved, but S4 stayed put because the movement didn't affect it yet.\n> \n> From the positions: at t, S4 at (2,6); at t+1 after U move, new body5 at (2,6), which is the same segment, so yes, it didn't move.\n> \n> To move the segment away from (2,6), we need a move that causes this segment to change position.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves in a way that the body is pulled, but in this case, since (2,6) is far from head, it may take several moves for it to move.\n> \n> Specifically, S4 will move when the segment in front of it moves, but S3 is at (2,5), which is left of (2,6), so if S3 moves, then S4 will move to where S3 was.\n> \n> S3 will move when S2 moves, and so on.\n> \n> So to vacate (2,6), we need to move the head such that after some steps, the body shifts and S4 moves to a different cell.\n> \n> For instance, if we move the head, it might take 4 moves for S4 to be affected, since it's the 5th segment.\n> \n> The segment S k will move when the head has moved k steps, roughly.\n> \n> In this position, the snake is coiled, so it might be sooner or later.\n> \n> Perhaps for now, since (2,6) is occupied, and food is there, we can only eat it if we move the head to (2,6) after the body has moved away.\n> \n> But since the body is on it, we need to first move so that the body leaves (2,6), then later head can go there.\n> \n> From the current state, after one move, S4 is still at (2,6), as above.\n> \n> After two moves, it might move, etc.\n> \n> Let's think about the food at (2,6) with life span 6, so it has from turn 44 to 49 to be eaten.\n> \n> Turn 44: C=6, after turn 44 C=5, so available at turns 44,45,46,47,48,49, gone at 50.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (2,2) with C=4, available turns 44,45,46,47.\n> \n> And (1,1) with C=9, available turns 44 to 52.\n> \n> Now, (2,2) is empty, so we can potentially eat it directly if head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly for (1,1).\n> \n> But (2,6) is under body, so we need to free it first.\n> \n> Also, the snake is long, 10 segments, so moving around might be tricky with the walls and obstacle.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, cells (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6?

        "thinking": "Let's analyze the current state and decide the immediate action for Turn 45.\n\n### Current State (Turn 45):\n- **Snake Positions**: [(5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3)]\n- **Head Direction**: R (right)\n- **Food**:\n  - (2, 2): value 1, life span 3 (disappears after Turn 47)\n  - (2, 6): value 1, life span 5 (disappears after Turn 49)\n  - (1, 1): value 1, life span 8 (disappears after Turn 52)\n- **Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacle at (3, 2).\n\n### Possible Moves:\nFrom the current head position (5, 4) and direction R, the possible moves are:\n1. **U (Up)**: (5, 5)\n   - Check: Not a wall, not occupied by body, no obstacle.\n2. **D (Down)**: (5, 3)\n   - Check: Not a wall, not occupied by body, no obstacle.\n3. **R (Right)**: (6, 4)\n   - Check: Not a wall (x=6 is playable), not occupied by body, no obstacle.\n4. **L (Left)**: (4, 4)\n   - Not allowed (opposite of current direction R).\n\n### Food Considerations:\n1. **(2, 2)**: Life span 3 (must eat by Turn 47). Distance from head: |5-2| + |4-2| = 5 moves. Too far to reach in time (only 2 turns left after Turn 45).\n2. **(2, 6)**: Under body segment (2, 6). To eat, the body must move away, which is unlikely soon.\n3. **(1, 1)**: Life span 8 (plenty of time). Distance: |5-1| + |4-1| = 7 moves. Not urgent.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nSince the food at (2, 2) is unreachable in time and (2, 6) is under the body, the best immediate action is to **move towards the center to avoid trapping the snake**. \n\n- **Move R (Right) to (6, 4)**:\n  - Moves the head away from the coiled body.\n  - Keeps options open for future moves.\n  - Avoids immediate collisions.\n\n### Verification:\n- After moving R to (6, 4), the new head is at (6, 4), and the tail segment (1, 3) is removed. The body shifts forward:\n  - New positions: [(6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4)]\n- No collisions or wall hits.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate action is to move **right (R)** to (6, 4).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

It's turn 44, and I'm playing Snake on a grid from (0,0) to (7,7), since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (4,4), then body segments at (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), and tail at (2,3). So the snake is 10 segments long.\n> \n> The head direction is R, meaning it was moving right to get to (4,4) from (3,4). Since it moved to (4,4), which is to the right of (3,4), direction is R.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (2,2) with value 1 and life span 4 (so it disappears after 4 turns, including this one? Life span decreases every turn, so if life span is 4 at turn 44, it will disappear after turn 47? Let's clarify: \"life-span disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 44, life span 4 means it will disappear at the end of turn 47? Countdown: at turn 44, countdown=4, after turn 44 it becomes 3, after turn 45 it becomes 2, after turn 46 it becomes 1, after turn 47 it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten until turn 47, and disappears before turn 48. Similarly for others.\n> \n> - Food at (2,6) with value 1 and life span 6. So countdown from 6 at turn 44, disappears after turn 49? Turn 44:6, 45:5, 46:4, 47:3, 48:2, 49:1, 50:0 gone. Life span N, disappears after N turns, meaning after N turns it's gone. \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means that it will be gone at the start of turn t + N or something. Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". For example, if N=1 at turn t, it disappears after that turn, so it's there at turn t but gone by turn t+1. If N=2 at turn t, it decreases to 1 at turn t+1, then to 0 at turn t+2, gone by turn t+3? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard way: at turn t, if life span is L, then after L turns, it disappears. Meaning, it is present for L more turns, including the current one? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, countdown is C, then after turn t, C becomes C-1, and when C=0, it disappears. So for food at (2,2): C=4 at turn 44. After turn 44, C=3; after turn 45, C=2; after turn 46, C=1; after turn 47, C=0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 44,45,46,47. Similarly, (2,6) C=6 at turn 44, can be eaten until turn 49 (since after turn 49, C=0 gone). And (1,1) C=9, can be eaten until turn 52.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all are positive food.\n> \n> Now, I need to move the snake. Current head at (4,4), direction R. Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move left immediately. So possible moves: U, D, R. L is not allowed because it would be instant reverse.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid walls and body collisions, but since the tail moves, head can go to where tail is now, because tail will move away.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid. Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and (3,2) is obstacle.\n> \n> Snake positions: list them:\n> \n> - Head: (4,4)\n> \n> - Body: (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)\n> \n> So tail is (2,3).\n> \n> Now, food at: (2,2), (2,6), (1,1)\n> \n> (2,6) is a food position, but (2,6) is also occupied by the snake body? Let's see: snake has (2,6) as one of the positions. Positions: (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)\n> \n> So (2,6) is the fifth segment, so it's occupied by the snake body. But food can spawn under the body, which is the case here. Food at (2,6) is under the snake body.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods: (2,2) is empty, (1,1) is empty.\n> \n> For food under body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it. So for (2,6), since it's under a body segment, not the head, we need that segment to move away, and then head to move there.\n> \n> But (2,6) is not the tail; tail is (2,3). So when the snake moves, the body will shift.\n> \n> I need to think about the movement.\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide. But in this case, tail is at (2,3), head at (4,4), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (4,4) adjacent to (4,3),(4,5),(3,4),(5,4), but (5,4) might be out or not, but (3,4) is body, not tail. Tail is (2,3), which is not adjacent to (4,4). Distance: |4-2|=2, |4-3|=1, not adjacent. So no issue now.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan 5+ turns ahead to maximize score with long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's see possible moves from (4,4):\n> \n> - U: to (4,5)\n> \n> - D: to (4,3)\n> \n> - R: to (5,4)\n> \n> L not allowed.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> - (4,5): is it wall or body? Walls: borders are walls, so y=0 and y=7 are walls, x=0 and x=7 are walls. (4,5): x=4, y=5, not border. Internal obstacle at (3,2), not here. Snake body: positions include (3,5), (2,5), etc., but (4,5) is not in the list. List: (4,4) is head, (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3). So (4,5) is free? (4,5) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3): not border, not obstacle, not in snake positions? (4,3) not listed, so free.\n> \n> (5,4): not border, not obstacle, not in snake positions? (5,4) not listed, so free.\n> \n> So all three moves are safe for now.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Food to consider: (2,2), (2,6), (1,1)\n> \n> (2,6) is under the snake body at (2,6). So to eat it, that segment needs to move away, and head needs to move there.\n> \n> Currently, (2,6) is occupied by body, so when snake moves, that body part will move to where the previous segment was? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So at turn 44, positions: head (4,4), then segments: 1:(3,4), 2:(3,5), 3:(2,5), 4:(2,6), 5:(1,6), 6:(1,5), 7:(1,4), 8:(1,3), 9:(2,3) — let's index for clarity.\n> \n> Define: at turn t, snake positions: S0 = head (4,4), S1 = (3,4), S2 = (3,5), S3 = (2,5), S4 = (2,6), S5 = (1,6), S6 = (1,5), S7 = (1,4), S8 = (1,3), S9 = tail (2,3).\n> \n> When snake moves in a direction, new head is based on move, and each body segment takes position of the previous one, so tail position is vacated.\n> \n> For example, if I move right to (5,4), then new positions: head (5,4), then S0 was (4,4) now body1, S1 was (3,4) now body2, ..., up to S8 was (2,3) now body9, and S9 tail is gone, so new tail is the previous S8 position? Let's see:\n> \n> After move, new head: (5,4)\n> \n> Then body segments: segment 1: old head (4,4), segment 2: old S1 (3,4), segment 3: old S2 (3,5), segment 4: old S3 (2,5), segment 5: old S4 (2,6), segment 6: old S5 (1,6), segment 7: old S6 (1,5), segment 8: old S7 (1,4), segment 9: old S8 (1,3), and tail: old S9 (2,3) is removed? No.\n> \n> The snake has 10 segments, so when head moves to new cell, the tail cell is left, so the snake grows only when eating food. Without eating, the tail moves, so the snake occupies the new head and all body segments shift forward, tail is removed.\n> \n> So after move without eating: new head at new position, body segments: segment i is at old segment i-1 position for i=1 to 9, and tail (segment 9) is at old segment 8 position? Better to think indices.\n> \n> Let positions at turn t: P0, P1, P2, ..., P9 where P0 head, P9 tail.\n> \n> After move to new head position H_new, the new positions are: H_new, P0, P1, P2, ..., P8.\n> \n> So the new tail is P8, and P9 is vacated.\n> \n> In this case, after move, if no food eaten, snake has same length, positions: new head, then old head, then old S1, ..., old S8.\n> \n> Old S9 is left.\n> \n> Specifically for us:\n> \n> Current: P0=(4,4), P1=(3,4), P2=(3,5), P3=(2,5), P4=(2,6), P5=(1,6), P6=(1,5), P7=(1,4), P8=(1,3), P9=(2,3)\n> \n> If move to (5,4) (R), new positions: head (5,4), then P0=(4,4), P1=(3,4), P2=(3,5), P3=(2,5), P4=(2,6), P5=(1,6), P6=(1,5), P7=(1,4), P8=(1,3), and P9=(2,3) is gone, so tail is now at (1,3), which was old P8.\n> \n> New tail is old P8, which is (1,3).\n> \n> Similarly, if move U to (4,5): new head (4,5), then (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), tail at (1,3)? Old P8 is (1,3), new positions: head (4,5), body1: (4,4), body2: (3,4), body3: (3,5), body4: (2,5), body5: (2,6), body6: (1,6), body7: (1,5), body8: (1,4), tail: (1,3) — but old P9 was (2,3), which is vacated.\n> \n> In new list, position after U: (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — so tail at (1,3).\n> \n> Similarly for D to (4,3): new head (4,3), then (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), tail at (1,3).\n> \n> In all cases, the new tail is at (1,3), since old P8 was (1,3).\n> \n> Now, food at (2,6) is under current P4. After any move, since the body shifts, (2,6) will be occupied by different segment or vacated?\n> \n> If I move, say, U: new positions, body5 is at (2,6) still? New body4 is old P3 (2,5), new body5 is old P4 (2,6), so (2,6) is still occupied by body, specifically new body5.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move R: new body5 is old P4 (2,6), so still occupied.\n> \n> If I move D, same.\n> \n> So immediately after move, (2,6) is still occupied because the segment that was there is now the previous segment, but since body shifts, the cell (2,6) might be reoccupied if the segment stays, but in this case, when moving, the segment that was at (2,6) moves to the position of old P3, which is (2,5)? Let's clarify.\n> \n> In the shift, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n> \n> For cell (2,6), it was occupied by P4. After move, P4 new position is old P3 position, which is (2,5). So the cell (2,6) is vacated only if no new segment moves there, but in the new positions, who is at (2,6)? New body5 is at old P4 position, which is (2,6), but old P4 is now new body5, and new body5 is at old P4 position, which is (2,6), so (2,6) is still occupied by new body5.\n> \n> For example, after move U: new head (4,5), new body1: old P0 (4,4), new body2: old P1 (3,4), new body3: old P2 (3,5), new body4: old P3 (2,5), new body5: old P4 (2,6), new body6: old P5 (1,6), etc. So (2,6) is now occupied by new body5, which is the same as old P4, so the food is still under the body.\n> \n> To eat the food at (2,6), we need the body to move away from it, meaning that the segment occupying it moves, and no other segment moves there immediately, so the cell is free, then head can move there later.\n> \n> Since the snake moves one step at a time, the cell (2,6) will be vacated when the segment that is there moves to a different position.\n> \n> In the current state, P4 is at (2,6). When the snake moves, P4 new position is old P3 position, which is (2,5), so it moves to (2,5). Then the new position for what was P4 is now at (2,5), so (2,6) is vacated only if no other part moves there. But in the new positions, new body5 is at old P4 position (2,6), but since P4 moved to (2,5), the cell (2,6) is now empty because new body5 is defined as at old P4 position, but old P4 position is (2,6), so new body5 is at (2,6), so it's still occupied.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Let's think of the grid cells.\n> \n> At turn t, cell (2,6) is occupied by the snake body segment at P4.\n> \n> After a move, the segment that was at P4 is now at the position that was P3, so it has moved to (2,5).\n> \n> The cell (2,6) is now empty because no segment is assigned to it anymore. The new body segment that occupies (2,6) is not there; the new body positions are based on the old positions shifted.\n> \n> After move, the new body segments are at the old positions of the previous segments.\n> \n> Specifically, new body1 is at old P0 position, new body2 at old P1 position, etc., up to new body9 at old P8 position.\n> \n> For cell (2,6), it was old P4 position. After move, new body5 is at old P4 position, which is (2,6), so new body5 is at (2,6). Therefore, (2,6) is still occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> The segment that was there is now elsewhere, but the cell is still occupied by a different segment.\n> \n> In terms of the grid, the cell (2,6) remains occupied because the body part that was P4 is now at (2,5), but the body part that was P5 is now at old P5 position? No.\n> \n> Let's list old positions and new positions after a move.\n> \n> Old positions:\n> - P0: (4,4)\n> - P1: (3,4)\n> - P2: (3,5)\n> - P3: (2,5)\n> - P4: (2,6)\n> - P5: (1,6)\n> - P6: (1,5)\n> - P7: (1,4)\n> - P8: (1,3)\n> - P9: (2,3)\n> \n> After move, say U to (4,5):\n> - New head: (4,5)\n> - New body1: old P0 = (4,4)\n> - New body2: old P1 = (3,4)\n> - New body3: old P2 = (3,5)\n> - New body4: old P3 = (2,5)\n> - New body5: old P4 = (2,6)\n> - New body6: old P5 = (1,6)\n> - New body7: old P6 = (1,5)\n> - New body8: old P7 = (1,4)\n> - New body9: old P8 = (1,3)  -- new tail\n> \n> Old P9 (2,3) is vacated.\n> \n> So cell (2,6) is occupied by new body5, which is at (2,6).\n> \n> Similarly, for any move, the cell (2,6) will be occupied by the new body5, which is at old P4 position, so it stays occupied until the snake moves in a way that this position changes.\n> \n> To vacate (2,6), we need the body to move so that no segment is at (2,6) after the shift. That means that the segment that is currently at P4 must move, and the position (2,6) should not be the new position for any body part.\n> \n> In the shift, the only way (2,6) is vacated is if it is not the position of any new body segment. But since new body5 is always at old P4 position, which is (2,6), it will be occupied as long as the snake has that many segments.\n> \n> Unless the snake eats food and grows, but for now, length is fixed.\n> \n> So (2,6) will remain occupied by the body until the snake moves in a way that the body part leaves it, but due to the shift, it's always occupied by the same \"logical\" segment or its position.\n> \n> Actually, the cell (2,6) is occupied by a body segment as long as that part of the body doesn't move away, but when the snake moves, the segment moves to a new position, so the cell is vacated, but immediately reoccupied by the next segment in line? No.\n> \n> In the example above, when snake moves U, the segment that was at P4 moves to new position (2,5) (which was old P3), so it leaves (2,6). Then the cell (2,6) is not occupied by that segment anymore. But in the new positions, new body5 is at (2,6), which is the position where old P4 was, but old P4 is now at (2,5), so the body part that was at P4 is now at (2,5), and the body part that was at P5 is now at old P5 position, which is (1,6), so for cell (2,6), after the move, it is occupied by new body5, but new body5 is the segment that was old P4, and it is at (2,6)? No.\n> \n> New body5 is at old P4 position, which is (2,6), and new body5 is the segment that was old P4, so the same segment is now at (2,6) again? I'm messing up.\n> \n> Let's label the segments.\n> \n> Denote the segments: S0 head, S1, S2, ..., S9 tail.\n> \n> At time t, positions: S0: (4,4), S1: (3,4), S2: (3,5), S3: (2,5), S4: (2,6), S5: (1,6), S6: (1,5), S7: (1,4), S8: (1,3), S9: (2,3)\n> \n> After moving U, new head is at (4,5).\n> \n> Then, the new body segments are: the segment that was S0 is now body1 at (4,4), the segment that was S1 is now body2 at (3,4), the segment that was S2 is now body3 at (3,5), the segment that was S3 is now body4 at (2,5), the segment that was S4 is now body5 at (2,6), the segment that was S5 is now body6 at (1,6), the segment that was S6 is now body7 at (1,5), the segment that was S7 is now body8 at (1,4), the segment that was S8 is now body9 at (1,3), and the segment that was S9 is gone.\n> \n> So for cell (2,6), it was occupied by S4 at time t. At time t+1, it is occupied by the same segment S4, which is now body5 at (2,6). So the cell is still occupied by the same snake part.\n> \n> The position didn't change for that segment; it stayed at (2,6).\n> \n> But when the snake moved, the head moved, but this body segment didn't move because the segments behind it moved, but in this case, since the head moved up, the body segments shift, but S4 was at (2,6), and after move, it is still at (2,6) because it became body5 at the same position.\n> \n> In terms of movement, S4 did not change position; it stayed.\n> \n> Only the head and the segments before it moved, but S4 stayed put because the movement didn't affect it yet.\n> \n> From the positions: at t, S4 at (2,6); at t+1 after U move, new body5 at (2,6), which is the same segment, so yes, it didn't move.\n> \n> To move the segment away from (2,6), we need a move that causes this segment to change position.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves in a way that the body is pulled, but in this case, since (2,6) is far from head, it may take several moves for it to move.\n> \n> Specifically, S4 will move when the segment in front of it moves, but S3 is at (2,5), which is left of (2,6), so if S3 moves, then S4 will move to where S3 was.\n> \n> S3 will move when S2 moves, and so on.\n> \n> So to vacate (2,6), we need to move the head such that after some steps, the body shifts and S4 moves to a different cell.\n> \n> For instance, if we move the head, it might take 4 moves for S4 to be affected, since it's the 5th segment.\n> \n> The segment S k will move when the head has moved k steps, roughly.\n> \n> In this position, the snake is coiled, so it might be sooner or later.\n> \n> Perhaps for now, since (2,6) is occupied, and food is there, we can only eat it if we move the head to (2,6) after the body has moved away.\n> \n> But since the body is on it, we need to first move so that the body leaves (2,6), then later head can go there.\n> \n> From the current state, after one move, S4 is still at (2,6), as above.\n> \n> After two moves, it might move, etc.\n> \n> Let's think about the food at (2,6) with life span 6, so it has from turn 44 to 49 to be eaten.\n> \n> Turn 44: C=6, after turn 44 C=5, so available at turns 44,45,46,47,48,49, gone at 50.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (2,2) with C=4, available turns 44,45,46,47.\n> \n> And (1,1) with C=9, available turns 44 to 52.\n> \n> Now, (2,2) is empty, so we can potentially eat it directly if head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly for (1,1).\n> \n> But (2,6) is under body, so we need to free it first.\n> \n> Also, the snake is long, 10 segments, so moving around might be tricky with the walls and obstacle.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, cells (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No.\n> \n> \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so playable area is inner grid x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but with internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> (3,2) is at x=3,y=2, which is within 1 to 6, so it's an obstacle.\n> \n> Also, food at (2,2), (2,6), (1,1) — (1,1) is corner, x=1,y=1, which is not border? Borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (1,1) is playable, similarly (2,2), (2,6) etc.\n> \n> (2,6) is at x=2,y=6, y=6 is not wall, since walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable.\n> \n> Similarly, x=2, x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=2 ok.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), tail (2,3).\n> \n> So the snake is mostly on the left side, from (1,3) to (1,6) and (2,3) to (2,6), with head at (4,4) and (3,4), (3,5).\n> \n> Head at (4,4), which is center-right.\n> \n> Food at (2,2) is below, (1,1) is bottom-left, (2,6) is top-left but under body.\n> \n> Now, to maximize score, I need to eat food while avoiding death.\n> \n> Since all food is +1, eating any is good, but with life span, some may expire soon.\n> \n> (2,2) has short life, only 4 turns including this, so I should consider eating it soon.\n> \n> (2,6) has longer life, but is under body.\n> \n> (1,1) has very long life.\n> \n> Also, after eating, snake grows, so it becomes harder to maneuver.\n> \n> Current length 10.\n> \n> Let's think about possible actions for turn 44.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, R (L not allowed).\n> \n> If I move U to (4,5): (4,5) is free?

So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Current turn is 46.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head at (6,4), then body segments: (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4). So the snake is 10 segments long. Head direction is right, meaning it just moved to (6,4) from the left, I assume, since it was moving right.\n> \n> Head direction is given as R, so it's facing right. That means from the previous position, it moved right to (6,4). Previous head was probably (5,4), but (5,4) is the second segment, so yes, it moved from (5,4) to (6,4).\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (2,2) with life span 2, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,1) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,4) with life span 10, value 1 (positive). But (5,4) is currently occupied by the snake's second segment. So this food is under the body.\n> \n> I need to think about how to eat food safely. Especially since (5,4) is under the body, I can only eat it if the body moves away and the head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Also, there's a rule about tail reward danger: if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, let's list all positions:\n> \n> Grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but walls at borders, so (0,y) and (7,y) are walls, similarly (x,0) and (x,7). And obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake: head (6,4), then (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4). So tail is at (1,4).\n> \n> Food at: (2,2), (2,6), (1,1), and (5,4) which is under the snake at (5,4).\n> \n> (2,6) is also a food position, but (2,6) is part of the snake? Snake has (2,6) as the 7th segment? Let's see: positions: index 0: head (6,4), 1: (5,4), 2: (4,4), 3: (3,4), 4: (3,5), 5: (2,5), 6: (2,6), 7: (1,6), 8: (1,5), 9: tail (1,4).\n> \n> So (2,6) is the snake's body segment at index 6. But food is at (2,6) with life span 4, value 1. So food is under the snake at (2,6) as well? No, the food positions are given separately, but (2,6) is listed as a food position, and it's also occupied by the snake. Similarly, (5,4) is food and occupied.\n> \n> Food at (2,6) and snake has a segment there. But food can spawn under body, so it's possible.\n> \n> Food list: (2,2,2,1), (2,6,4,1), (1,1,7,1), (5,4,10,1). So (2,6) and (5,4) are under snake body segments.\n> \n> To eat them, the body must move away, then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Now, life spans: for (2,2), life span 2, so it disappears after 2 turns, meaning on turn 48, it might be gone? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn 46, so:\n> \n> - (2,2): life span 2, so after turn 46, it will have 1 left, and after turn 47, it will have 0 and disappear, so it can be eaten on turn 46 or 47? Life span decreases each turn, including current, so on turn 46, when we start, life span is 2. After we move this turn (turn 46), life span decreases to 1 for the next state. Then on turn 47, after move, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 46 or 47.\n> \n> Similarly:\n> \n> - (2,6): life span 4, so available for 4 turns: turns 46,47,48,49? After turn 46 move, life span 3; turn 47 move, life span 2; turn 48 move, life span 1; turn 49 move, life span 0, disappear. So can be eaten on turns 46 to 49.\n> \n> But (2,6) is under snake body now, so we need to move the body away first.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1): life span 7, so available for many turns.\n> \n> (5,4): life span 10, also long time.\n> \n> (5,4) is under the second segment, (5,4).\n> \n> Snake head is at (6,4), moving right. But x=7 is wall, so it cannot move right, because that would be (7,4), which is wall.\n> \n> Head direction is R, but at (6,4), moving right to (7,4) is invalid, wall. So it must change direction.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,4): current head position.\n> \n> Directions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1)\n> \n> But R to (7,4) is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> L to (5,4), but (5,4) is occupied by the snake body, second segment.\n> \n> Collision: if head moves to a body segment, it dies, unless it's the tail and we can move into it because tail moves.\n> \n> Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment except that you can move into the tail cell because tail will move.\n> \n> Specifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But (5,4) is not the tail; it's the second segment, close to head.\n> \n> Tail is at (1,4).\n> \n> So from (6,4):\n> \n> - Move U to (6,5): is this free? Let's see what's there.\n> \n> First, grid positions:\n> \n> List all occupied cells by snake:\n> \n> (6,4) head\n> \n> (5,4) body\n> \n> (4,4) body\n> \n> (3,4) body\n> \n> (3,5) body\n> \n> (2,5) body\n> \n> (2,6) body\n> \n> (1,6) body\n> \n> (1,5) body\n> \n> (1,4) tail\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal (3,2)\n> \n> So (6,5): is it occupied? Snake has (6,4), (5,4), etc., no (6,5). Walls: x=6,y=5 is within 1-6, not wall except borders, so (6,5) should be free? x=6,y=5: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, so (6,5) is playable, no wall, not occupied by snake currently.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3): y=3, should be free.\n> \n> (5,4) is occupied, but that's left.\n> \n> So possible moves from (6,4):\n> \n> - U: to (6,5) - possible, no snake, no wall\n> \n> - D: to (6,3) - possible, no snake, no wall\n> \n> - L: to (5,4) - occupied by body segment, not tail, so collision, death\n> \n> - R: to (7,4) - wall, death\n> \n> So only U or D are safe moves.\n> \n> Head direction is R, but since we can't move R, and we have to choose, U or D.\n> \n> No instant reverse: but since we can't move R or L effectively, U and D are not opposite to R? Opposite to R would be L, but we're not moving L, U and D are perpendicular, so no issue with reverse.\n> \n> So for turn 46, action must be U or D.\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead to maximize score.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> (2,2) - life span 2, so must be eaten soon or lost. But (2,2) is at bottom-left, snake is at top-right.\n> \n> (2,6) - life span 4, but it's under snake body at (2,6), which is segment index 6.\n> \n> (1,1) - life span 7, bottom-left.\n> \n> (5,4) - under body at (5,4), index 1.\n> \n> Also, after eating, snake grows, so positions change.\n> \n> I should plan a path to get food safely.\n> \n> First, let's consider the immediate move.\n> \n> If I move U to (6,5), or D to (6,3).\n> \n> Now, from there, where can I go.\n> \n> Also, the tail is at (1,4), and if I eat food, it grows.\n> \n> But for now, no food eaten this turn, since no food at (6,4), (6,5), or (6,3).\n> \n> Foods are at (2,2), (2,6), (1,1), (5,4).\n> \n> None near head.\n> \n> So turn 46: move U or D.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid rows y=1 to 6, cols x=1 to 6.\n> \n> y=1 bottom, y=6 top? Usually in coordinates, y increases up, but in movement, U is y+1, so y=1 is bottom, y=6 top? In the positions, snake has (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), etc., so y=6 is top row.\n> \n> Similarly, x=1 left, x=6 right.\n> \n> Walls: x=0 and x=7 are left and right walls, y=0 bottom wall, y=7 top wall, but since grid is 1-6, y=0 and y=7 are outside.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake: head (6,4), body: (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), tail (1,4).\n> \n> So the snake is mostly on row 4, with a turn at (3,4) to (3,5), then up to (2,6), left to (1,6), down to (1,5), down to (1,4)? (1,5) to (1,4) is down, y-1.\n> \n> (1,6) to (1,5) is down, (1,5) to (1,4) is down.\n> \n> But tail is at (1,4).\n> \n> Foods:\n> \n> - (2,2) - bottom-left\n> \n> - (2,6) - top-left, but occupied by snake body\n> \n> - (1,1) - bottom-left corner\n> \n> - (5,4) - on row 4, column 5, occupied by snake body\n> \n> Life spans: (2,2) has life span 2, so after turn 46, it will have 1, then after turn 47, 0, gone. So can be eaten on turn 46 or 47, but turn 46 head is at (6,4), far away, so impossible to reach by turn 47? Distance: from (6,4) to (2,2), min Manhattan distance is |6-2| + |4-2| = 4 + 2 = 6, so at least 6 moves, but we have only 2 turns? Turn 46 and 47, but to eat on turn 47, we need to be at (2,2) on turn 47.\n> \n> After turn 46 move, we are at new position, then turn 47 move.\n> \n> Current turn 46, we move to, say, (6,5) or (6,3), then from there, we can move towards (2,2), but from (6,5) to (2,2) is |6-2| + |5-2| = 4+3=7 moves, too far. Similarly from (6,3), |6-2| + |3-2| =4+1=5 moves, still more than 2, and we have only this move and next to reach, but after turn 46 move, we are not at (2,2), and on turn 47 we can move one step, so at best we can be at distance 1 on turn 46 after move, but from (6,4) to (2,2) is far, so impossible to eat (2,2) before it disappears. It will disappear after turn 47, so we cannot eat it. It's lost.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) has life span 4, so available turns 46,47,48,49.\n> \n> But (2,6) is currently occupied by snake body, so we need to move the snake so that the body leaves (2,6), then head can move there.\n> \n> Currently, (2,6) is occupied by the 6th segment. When the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so segments shift.\n> \n> Let's simulate snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail segment is removed, unless food is eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, tail moves away.\n> \n> For (2,6) food: it is under body now. After each move, the snake shifts, so the segment that was at (2,6) will move to the next position.\n> \n> Current positions: index 6 is at (2,6). When snake moves, the head moves to new cell, then segment 1 moves to where head was, segment 2 to where segment 1 was, ..., segment 6 to where segment 5 was, which is (2,5), since segment 5 is (2,5) now? Positions: let's list with indices:\n> \n> 0: head (6,4)\n> \n> 1: (5,4)\n> \n> 2: (4,4)\n> \n> 3: (3,4)\n> \n> 4: (3,5)\n> \n> 5: (2,5)\n> \n> 6: (2,6)\n> \n> 7: (1,6)\n> \n> 8: (1,5)\n> \n> 9: tail (1,4)\n> \n> After a move, if no food eaten, head moves to new position, then segment 1 moves to (6,4), segment 2 to (5,4), ..., segment 6 moves to where segment 5 was, (2,5), segment 7 to where segment 6 was, (2,6), segment 8 to where segment 7 was, (1,6), segment 9 to where segment 8 was, (1,5), and tail was at (1,4), which is left, so the cell (1,4) is now free, but since no food, tail moves, so (1,4) is empty.\n> \n> For food at (2,6): it is currently occupied by segment 6. After a move, segment 6 moves to (2,5), so the cell (2,6) is now occupied by segment 7, which moves to where segment 6 was, so (2,6) is still occupied by the snake, but by a different segment.\n> \n> Segment 7 was at (1,6), after move, it moves to (2,6), since segment 6 was at (2,6), so segment 7 moves to (2,6).\n> \n> Similarly, segment 6 moves to (2,5), which was segment 5's position.\n> \n> So the cell (2,6) remains occupied by the snake after the move, because segment 7 moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, for any body cell except the tail, when the snake moves, the cell may still be occupied if there is a segment moving into it.\n> \n> Specifically, for a body segment at position P, after move, the segment that was behind it moves to P, so P is still occupied unless it was the tail position.\n> \n> The tail position is the only one that becomes free if no food eaten.\n> \n> In this case, (2,6) is not the tail; tail is at (1,4). After move, the tail moves to (1,5), so (1,4) becomes free, but (2,6) is now occupied by segment 7, which was at (1,6) and moves to (2,6).\n> \n> So (2,6) remains occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, for (5,4), it is occupied by segment 1. After move, segment 1 moves to where head was, (6,4), so (5,4) is now occupied by segment 2, which moves there.\n> \n> So to free up a cell that has food under it, we need the snake to move so that no segment is on that cell anymore, which means the tail must pass over it or something.\n> \n> Since the snake is moving, a cell becomes free only if it was the tail position and no food eaten, or if the snake moves away and no segment fills it.\n> \n> But for a body cell, when the snake moves, the cell is immediately filled by the next segment, so it never becomes free unless that segment was the tail and we don't eat food.\n> \n> Specifically, for a position P occupied by segment K, after move, segment K moves to the position of segment K-1, and segment K+1 moves to P.\n> \n> So P is now occupied by segment K+1.\n> \n> Therefore, the only way for a cell to become empty is if it was occupied by the tail and we don't eat food, then tail moves away, and it's free.\n> \n> Otherwise, body cells are always occupied when the snake moves without eating.\n> \n> For food under body, to eat it, we need the tail to be on that cell, and then when we move without eating food, the tail moves away, and the cell is free, then later head can move onto it.\n> \n> But in this case, for (2,6), it is occupied by segment 6, not tail. Tail is at (1,4).\n> \n> The tail will move to (1,5) after one move, then to (1,6) or wherever.\n> \n> To have (2,6) free, we need segment 6 to be the last segment or something, but it's not.\n> \n> The food at (2,6) can only be eaten if the snake moves such that the segment on it moves away and no other segment moves in, but from above, when the snake moves, if the cell was not tail, it remains occupied.\n> \n> So the only time a non-tail body cell becomes free is if the snake shortens or something, but we don't shorten, only grow or stay same length.\n> \n> Since we can only grow by eating food, but for a cell with food under body, to access it, we need to have that cell be the tail when we move away.\n> \n> That is, we need to move the tail to that position.\n> \n> For example, to eat food at P, if P is under body, we need to have the tail on P at some point, then when we move the snake without eating food, the tail moves away, P is free, then head can move to P later.\n> \n> But the head might not be able to reach it easily.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,6), it is segment 6. The tail is segment 9 at (1,4).\n> \n> After moves, the tail will move.\n> \n> But to have (2,6) become tail, we need the snake to move in a way that the segment on (2,6) becomes the tail, which means we need to eat food to grow, but eating food makes the tail stay, so the cell doesn't become free.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Suppose a cell P has food and is occupied by segment K.\n> \n> If we move and eat food elsewhere, the snake grows, so segment K is still there, and P remains occupied.\n> \n> If we don't eat food, segment K moves to the position of segment K-1, and segment K+1 moves to P, so P is still occupied.\n> \n> The only way for P to become free is if, when the tail is on P, and we move without eating food, then the tail moves away, and P is free.\n> \n> But for P to be the tail, it must be that segment K is the last segment.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,6), it is segment 6, and there are segments 7,8,9 after it, so it is not the tail. To make it the tail, we need to have the snake consume the segments after it, but we can't remove segments, only add.\n> \n> So it's impossible to make (2,6) the tail unless we eat food to grow the front, but the tail remains the same.\n> \n> When we eat food, the tail doesn't move, so the segment at tail position stays.\n> \n> But for (2,6), it's not the tail, so we can never free it by moving, because the snake is connected, and as long as there are segments behind it, when the snake moves, those segments will occupy the positions.\n> \n> Specifically, for any body segment that is not the tail, when the snake moves, the cell it occupied is taken by the next segment.\n> \n> So the only cell that can be freed is the tail position when we move without eating food.\n> \n> For a food under a non-tail body segment, it can only be eaten if the head is already on it, but head is not on it, and to have head on it, it must be free, which it never is, so it's impossible to eat food that is under a non-tail body segment because the cell is always occupied and head can't move there.\n> \n> But the rules say: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1.

This would cause a collision (head touches body), so **invalid**.\n2. **D (down) to (6, 2)**:\n   - (6, 2) is free (no wall or snake). Valid.\n3. **L (left) to (5, 3)**:\n   - (5, 3) is free. Valid.\n4. **R (right) to (7, 3)**:\n   - (7, 3) is a wall (x=7). Invalid.\n\n### Movement Constraints:\n- **No instant reverse**: The head direction is D (down), so the opposite direction is U (up). Moving U is already invalid due to collision, so no issue here.\n- **Valid moves**: D or L.\n\n### Food Considerations:\n- (2, 2) will disappear after this turn, and it's too far to reach in one move (Manhattan distance from (6,3) to (2,2) is 4 + 1 = 5). Ignore.\n- (5, 4) is under the snake's body and cannot be eaten this turn (the body must move away first).\n- (1, 1) and (2, 6) are possible targets, but not reachable immediately.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nFrom the valid moves (D or L), neither leads to food this turn. We should choose a move that keeps the snake safe and potentially moves towards food in future turns. \n\n- Moving **D (down) to (6, 2)**:\n  - Moves the snake towards the bottom of the grid, closer to (1,1) in the long run.\n  - Avoids getting boxed in near the top-right corner.\n\n- Moving **L (left) to (5, 3)**:\n  - Moves the snake towards the center, but doesn't provide a clear advantage.\n\n### Decision:\nMove **D (down)** to (6, 2) to start navigating towards the bottom-left where (1,1) is located. This is a safe move that doesn't risk immediate collision and opens up future opportunities.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Current turn is 46.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head at (6,4), then body segments: (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4). So the snake is 10 segments long. Head direction is right, meaning it just moved to (6,4) from the left, I assume, since it was moving right.\n> \n> Head direction is given as R, so it's facing right. That means from the previous position, it moved right to (6,4). Previous head was probably (5,4), but (5,4) is the second segment, so yes, it moved from (5,4) to (6,4).\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (2,2) with life span 2, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,1) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,4) with life span 10, value 1 (positive). But (5,4) is currently occupied by the snake's second segment. So this food is under the body.\n> \n> I need to think about how to eat food safely. Especially since (5,4) is under the body, I can only eat it if the body moves away and the head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Also, there's a rule about tail reward danger: if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, let's list all positions:\n> \n> Grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but walls at borders, so (0,y) and (7,y) are walls, similarly (x,0) and (x,7). And obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake: head (6,4), then (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4). So tail is at (1,4).\n> \n> Food at: (2,2), (2,6), (1,1), and (5,4) which is under the snake at (5,4).\n> \n> (2,6) is also a food position, but (2,6) is part of the snake? Snake has (2,6) as the 7th segment? Let's see: positions: index 0: head (6,4), 1: (5,4), 2: (4,4), 3: (3,4), 4: (3,5), 5: (2,5), 6: (2,6), 7: (1,6), 8: (1,5), 9: tail (1,4).\n> \n> So (2,6) is the snake's body segment at index 6. But food is at (2,6) with life span 4, value 1. So food is under the snake at (2,6) as well? No, the food positions are given separately, but (2,6) is listed as a food position, and it's also occupied by the snake. Similarly, (5,4) is food and occupied.\n> \n> Food at (2,6) and snake has a segment there. But food can spawn under body, so it's possible.\n> \n> Food list: (2,2,2,1), (2,6,4,1), (1,1,7,1), (5,4,10,1). So (2,6) and (5,4) are under snake body segments.\n> \n> To eat them, the body must move away, then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Now, life spans: for (2,2), life span 2, so it disappears after 2 turns, meaning on turn 48, it might be gone? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn 46, so:\n> \n> - (2,2): life span 2, so after turn 46, it will have 1 left, and after turn 47, it will have 0 and disappear, so it can be eaten on turn 46 or 47? Life span decreases each turn, including current, so on turn 46, when we start, life span is 2. After we move this turn (turn 46), life span decreases to 1 for the next state. Then on turn 47, after move, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 46 or 47.\n> \n> Similarly:\n> \n> - (2,6): life span 4, so available for 4 turns: turns 46,47,48,49? After turn 46 move, life span 3; turn 47 move, life span 2; turn 48 move, life span 1; turn 49 move, life span 0, disappear. So can be eaten on turns 46 to 49.\n> \n> But (2,6) is under snake body now, so we need to move the body away first.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1): life span 7, so available for many turns.\n> \n> (5,4): life span 10, also long time.\n> \n> (5,4) is under the second segment, (5,4).\n> \n> Snake head is at (6,4), moving right. But x=7 is wall, so it cannot move right, because that would be (7,4), which is wall.\n> \n> Head direction is R, but at (6,4), moving right to (7,4) is invalid, wall. So it must change direction.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,4): current head position.\n> \n> Directions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1)\n> \n> But R to (7,4) is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> L to (5,4), but (5,4) is occupied by the snake body, second segment.\n> \n> Collision: if head moves to a body segment, it dies, unless it's the tail and we can move into it because tail moves.\n> \n> Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment except that you can move into the tail cell because tail will move.\n> \n> Specifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But (5,4) is not the tail; it's the second segment, close to head.\n> \n> Tail is at (1,4).\n> \n> So from (6,4):\n> \n> - Move U to (6,5): is this free? Let's see what's there.\n> \n> First, grid positions:\n> \n> List all occupied cells by snake:\n> \n> (6,4) head\n> \n> (5,4) body\n> \n> (4,4) body\n> \n> (3,4) body\n> \n> (3,5) body\n> \n> (2,5) body\n> \n> (2,6) body\n> \n> (1,6) body\n> \n> (1,5) body\n> \n> (1,4) tail\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal (3,2)\n> \n> So (6,5): is it occupied? Snake has (6,4), (5,4), etc., no (6,5). Walls: x=6,y=5 is within 1-6, not wall except borders, so (6,5) should be free? x=6,y=5: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, so (6,5) is playable, no wall, not occupied by snake currently.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3): y=3, should be free.\n> \n> (5,4) is occupied, but that's left.\n> \n> So possible moves from (6,4):\n> \n> - U: to (6,5) - possible, no snake, no wall\n> \n> - D: to (6,3) - possible, no snake, no wall\n> \n> - L: to (5,4) - occupied by body segment, not tail, so collision, death\n> \n> - R: to (7,4) - wall, death\n> \n> So only U or D are safe moves.\n> \n> Head direction is R, but since we can't move R, and we have to choose, U or D.\n> \n> No instant reverse: but since we can't move R or L effectively, U and D are not opposite to R? Opposite to R would be L, but we're not moving L, U and D are perpendicular, so no issue with reverse.\n> \n> So for turn 46, action must be U or D.\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead to maximize score.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> (2,2) - life span 2, so must be eaten soon or lost. But (2,2) is at bottom-left, snake is at top-right.\n> \n> (2,6) - life span 4, but it's under snake body at (2,6), which is segment index 6.\n> \n> (1,1) - life span 7, bottom-left.\n> \n> (5,4) - under body at (5,4), index 1.\n> \n> Also, after eating, snake grows, so positions change.\n> \n> I should plan a path to get food safely.\n> \n> First, let's consider the immediate move.\n> \n> If I move U to (6,5), or D to (6,3).\n> \n> Now, from there, where can I go.\n> \n> Also, the tail is at (1,4), and if I eat food, it grows.\n> \n> But for now, no food eaten this turn, since no food at (6,4), (6,5), or (6,3).\n> \n> Foods are at (2,2), (2,6), (1,1), (5,4).\n> \n> None near head.\n> \n> So turn 46: move U or D.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid rows y=1 to 6, cols x=1 to 6.\n> \n> y=1 bottom, y=6 top? Usually in coordinates, y increases up, but in movement, U is y+1, so y=1 is bottom, y=6 top? In the positions, snake has (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), etc., so y=6 is top row.\n> \n> Similarly, x=1 left, x=6 right.\n> \n> Walls: x=0 and x=7 are left and right walls, y=0 bottom wall, y=7 top wall, but since grid is 1-6, y=0 and y=7 are outside.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake: head (6,4), body: (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), tail (1,4).\n> \n> So the snake is mostly on row 4, with a turn at (3,4) to (3,5), then up to (2,6), left to (1,6), down to (1,5), down to (1,4)? (1,5) to (1,4) is down, y-1.\n> \n> (1,6) to (1,5) is down, (1,5) to (1,4) is down.\n> \n> But tail is at (1,4).\n> \n> Foods:\n> \n> - (2,2) - bottom-left\n> \n> - (2,6) - top-left, but occupied by snake body\n> \n> - (1,1) - bottom-left corner\n> \n> - (5,4) - on row 4, column 5, occupied by snake body\n> \n> Life spans: (2,2) has life span 2, so after turn 46, it will have 1, then after turn 47, 0, gone. So can be eaten on turn 46 or 47, but turn 46 head is at (6,4), far away, so impossible to reach by turn 47? Distance: from (6,4) to (2,2), min Manhattan distance is |6-2| + |4-2| = 4 + 2 = 6, so at least 6 moves, but we have only 2 turns? Turn 46 and 47, but to eat on turn 47, we need to be at (2,2) on turn 47.\n> \n> After turn 46 move, we are at new position, then turn 47 move.\n> \n> Current turn 46, we move to, say, (6,5) or (6,3), then from there, we can move towards (2,2), but from (6,5) to (2,2) is |6-2| + |5-2| = 4+3=7 moves, too far. Similarly from (6,3), |6-2| + |3-2| =4+1=5 moves, still more than 2, and we have only this move and next to reach, but after turn 46 move, we are not at (2,2), and on turn 47 we can move one step, so at best we can be at distance 1 on turn 46 after move, but from (6,4) to (2,2) is far, so impossible to eat (2,2) before it disappears. It will disappear after turn 47, so we cannot eat it. It's lost.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) has life span 4, so available turns 46,47,48,49.\n> \n> But (2,6) is currently occupied by snake body, so we need to move the snake so that the body leaves (2,6), then head can move there.\n> \n> Currently, (2,6) is occupied by the 6th segment. When the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so segments shift.\n> \n> Let's simulate snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail segment is removed, unless food is eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, tail moves away.\n> \n> For (2,6) food: it is under body now. After each move, the snake shifts, so the segment that was at (2,6) will move to the next position.\n> \n> Current positions: index 6 is at (2,6). When snake moves, the head moves to new cell, then segment 1 moves to where head was, segment 2 to where segment 1 was, ..., segment 6 to where segment 5 was, which is (2,5), since segment 5 is (2,5) now? Positions: let's list with indices:\n> \n> 0: head (6,4)\n> \n> 1: (5,4)\n> \n> 2: (4,4)\n> \n> 3: (3,4)\n> \n> 4: (3,5)\n> \n> 5: (2,5)\n> \n> 6: (2,6)\n> \n> 7: (1,6)\n> \n> 8: (1,5)\n> \n> 9: tail (1,4)\n> \n> After a move, if no food eaten, head moves to new position, then segment 1 moves to (6,4), segment 2 to (5,4), ..., segment 6 moves to where segment 5 was, (2,5), segment 7 to where segment 6 was, (2,6), segment 8 to where segment 7 was, (1,6), segment 9 to where segment 8 was, (1,5), and tail was at (1,4), which is left, so the cell (1,4) is now free, but since no food, tail moves, so (1,4) is empty.\n> \n> For food at (2,6): it is currently occupied by segment 6. After a move, segment 6 moves to (2,5), so the cell (2,6) is now occupied by segment 7, which moves to where segment 6 was, so (2,6) is still occupied by the snake, but by a different segment.\n> \n> Segment 7 was at (1,6), after move, it moves to (2,6), since segment 6 was at (2,6), so segment 7 moves to (2,6).\n> \n> Similarly, segment 6 moves to (2,5), which was segment 5's position.\n> \n> So the cell (2,6) remains occupied by the snake after the move, because segment 7 moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, for any body cell except the tail, when the snake moves, the cell may still be occupied if there is a segment moving into it.\n> \n> Specifically, for a body segment at position P, after move, the segment that was behind it moves to P, so P is still occupied unless it was the tail position.\n> \n> The tail position is the only one that becomes free if no food eaten.\n> \n> In this case, (2,6) is not the tail; tail is at (1,4). After move, the tail moves to (1,5), so (1,4) becomes free, but (2,6) is now occupied by segment 7, which was at (1,6) and moves to (2,6).\n> \n> So (2,6) remains occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, for (5,4), it is occupied by segment 1. After move, segment 1 moves to where head was, (6,4), so (5,4) is now occupied by segment 2, which moves there.\n> \n> So to free up a cell that has food under it, we need the snake to move so that no segment is on that cell anymore, which means the tail must pass over it or something.\n> \n> Since the snake is moving, a cell becomes free only if it was the tail position and no food eaten, or if the snake moves away and no segment fills it.\n> \n> But for a body cell, when the snake moves, the cell is immediately filled by the next segment, so it never becomes free unless that segment was the tail and we don't eat food.\n> \n> Specifically, for a position P occupied by segment K, after move, segment K moves to the position of segment K-1, and segment K+1 moves to P.\n> \n> So P is now occupied by segment K+1.\n> \n> Therefore, the only way for a cell to become empty is if it was occupied by the tail and we don't eat food, then tail moves away, and it's free.\n> \n> Otherwise, body cells are always occupied when the snake moves without eating.\n> \n> For food under body, to eat it, we need the tail to be on that cell, and then when we move without eating food, the tail moves away, and the cell is free, then later head can move onto it.\n> \n> But in this case, for (2,6), it is occupied by segment 6, not tail. Tail is at (1,4).\n> \n> The tail will move to (1,5) after one move, then to (1,6) or wherever.\n> \n> To have (2,6) free, we need segment 6 to be the last segment or something, but it's not.\n> \n> The food at (2,6) can only be eaten if the snake moves such that the segment on it moves away and no other segment moves in, but from above, when the snake moves, if the cell was not tail, it remains occupied.\n> \n> So the only time a non-tail body cell becomes free is if the snake shortens or something, but we don't shorten, only grow or stay same length.\n> \n> Since we can only grow by eating food, but for a cell with food under body, to access it, we need to have that cell be the tail when we move away.\n> \n> That is, we need to move the tail to that position.\n> \n> For example, to eat food at P, if P is under body, we need to have the tail on P at some point, then when we move the snake without eating food, the tail moves away, P is free, then head can move to P later.\n> \n> But the head might not be able to reach it easily.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,6), it is segment 6. The tail is segment 9 at (1,4).\n> \n> After moves, the tail will move.\n> \n> But to have (2,6) become tail, we need the snake to move in a way that the segment on (2,6) becomes the tail, which means we need to eat food to grow, but eating food makes the tail stay, so the cell doesn't become free.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Suppose a cell P has food and is occupied by segment K.\n> \n> If we move and eat food elsewhere, the snake grows, so segment K is still there, and P remains occupied.\n> \n> If we don't eat food, segment K moves to the position of segment K-1, and segment K+1 moves to P, so P is still occupied.\n> \n> The only way for P to become free is if, when the tail is on P, and we move without eating food, then the tail moves away, and P is free.\n> \n> But for P to be the tail, it must be that segment K is the last segment.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,6), it is segment 6, and there are segments 7,8,9 after it, so it is not the tail. To make it the tail, we need to have the snake consume the segments after it, but we can't remove segments, only add.\n> \n> So it's impossible to make (2,6) the tail unless we eat food to grow the front, but the tail remains the same.\n> \n> When we eat food, the tail doesn't move, so the segment at tail position stays.\n> \n> But for (2,6), it's not the tail, so we can never free it by moving, because the snake is connected, and as long as there are segments behind it, when the snake moves, those segments will occupy the positions.\n> \n> Specifically, for any body segment that is not the tail, when the snake moves, the cell it occupied is taken by the next segment.\n> \n> So the only cell that can be freed is the tail position when we move without eating food.\n> \n> For a food under a non-tail body segment, it can only be eaten if the head is already on it, but head is not on it, and to have head on it, it must be free, which it never is, so it's impossible to eat food that is under a non-tail body segment because the cell is always occupied and head can't move there.\n> \n> But the rules say: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2.

No, because the movement is discrete; at each turn, the positions are updated simultaneously, so after move, the cell is immediately occupied by the next segment.\n> \n> So there is no time when the cell is free; it's always occupied by some segment until the tail leaves it.\n> \n> But for a cell that was occupied by segment K, when segment K moves away, segment K+1 moves in at the same time, so it's never empty.\n> \n> The only exception is the tail position: when the tail moves away, if no food eaten, it becomes empty.\n> \n> For a non-tail cell with food, it can never be eaten because it's never accessible to the head.\n> \n> But that can't be right; the rules imply it is possible.\n> \n> Let me read the rules again.\n> \n> \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1.

Usually in coordinates, y increases up, but in movement, U is y+1, so y=1 is bottom, y=6 top? In the positions, snake has (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), etc., so y=6 is top row.\n> \n> Similarly, x=1 left, x=6 right.\n> \n> Walls: x=0 and x=7 are left and right walls, y=0 bottom wall, y=7 top wall, but since grid is 1-6, y=0 and y=7 are outside.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake: head (6,4), body: (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), tail (1,4).\n> \n> So the snake is mostly on row 4, with a turn at (3,4) to (3,5), then up to (2,6), left to (1,6), down to (1,5), down to (1,4)? (1,5) to (1,4) is down, y-1.\n> \n> (1,6) to (1,5) is down, (1,5) to (1,4) is down.\n> \n> But tail is at (1,4).\n> \n> Foods:\n> \n> - (2,2) - bottom-left\n> \n> - (2,6) - top-left, but occupied by snake body\n> \n> - (1,1) - bottom-left corner\n> \n> - (5,4) - on row 4, column 5, occupied by snake body\n> \n> Life spans: (2,2) has life span 2, so after turn 46, it will have 1, then after turn 47, 0, gone. So can be eaten on turn 46 or 47, but turn 46 head is at (6,4), far away, so impossible to reach by turn 47? Distance: from (6,4) to (2,2), min Manhattan distance is |6-2| + |4-2| = 4 + 2 = 6, so at least 6 moves, but we have only 2 turns? Turn 46 and 47, but to eat on turn 47, we need to be at (2,2) on turn 47.\n> \n> After turn 46 move, we are at new position, then turn 47 move.\n> \n> Current turn 46, we move to, say, (6,5) or (6,3), then from there, we can move towards (2,2), but from (6,5) to (2,2) is |6-2| + |5-2| = 4+3=7 moves, too far. Similarly from (6,3), |6-2| + |3-2| =4+1=5 moves, still more than 2, and we have only this move and next to reach, but after turn 46 move, we are not at (2,2), and on turn 47 we can move one step, so at best we can be at distance 1 on turn 46 after move, but from (6,4) to (2,2) is far, so impossible to eat (2,2) before it disappears. It will disappear after turn 47, so we cannot eat it. It's lost.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) has life span 4, so available turns 46,47,48,49.\n> \n> But (2,6) is currently occupied by snake body, so we need to move the snake so that the body leaves (2,6), then head can move there.\n> \n> Currently, (2,6) is occupied by the 6th segment. When the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so segments shift.\n> \n> Let's simulate snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail segment is removed, unless food is eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, tail moves away.\n> \n> For (2,6) food: it is under body now. After each move, the snake shifts, so the segment that was at (2,6) will move to the next position.\n> \n> Current positions: index 6 is at (2,6). When snake moves, the head moves to new cell, then segment 1 moves to where head was, segment 2 to where segment 1 was, ..., segment 6 to where segment 5 was, which is (2,5), since segment 5 is (2,5) now? Positions: let's list with indices:\n> \n> 0: head (6,4)\n> \n> 1: (5,4)\n> \n> 2: (4,4)\n> \n> 3: (3,4)\n> \n> 4: (3,5)\n> \n> 5: (2,5)\n> \n> 6: (2,6)\n> \n> 7: (1,6)\n> \n> 8: (1,5)\n> \n> 9: tail (1,4)\n> \n> After a move, if no food eaten, head moves to new position, then segment 1 moves to (6,4), segment 2 to (5,4), ..., segment 6 moves to where segment 5 was, (2,5), segment 7 to where segment 6 was, (2,6), segment 8 to where segment 7 was, (1,6), segment 9 to where segment 8 was, (1,5), and tail was at (1,4), which is left, so the cell (1,4) is now free, but since no food, tail moves, so (1,4) is empty.\n> \n> For food at (2,6): it is currently occupied by segment 6. After a move, segment 6 moves to (2,5), so the cell (2,6) is now occupied by segment 7, which moves to where segment 6 was, so (2,6) is still occupied by the snake, but by a different segment.\n> \n> Segment 7 was at (1,6), after move, it moves to (2,6), since segment 6 was at (2,6), so segment 7 moves to (2,6).\n> \n> Similarly, segment 6 moves to (2,5), which was segment 5's position.\n> \n> So the cell (2,6) remains occupied by the snake after the move, because segment 7 moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, for any body cell except the tail, when the snake moves, the cell may still be occupied if there is a segment moving into it.\n> \n> Specifically, for a body segment at position P, after move, the segment that was behind it moves to P, so P is still occupied unless it was the tail position.\n> \n> The tail position is the only one that becomes free if no food eaten.\n> \n> In this case, (2,6) is not the tail; tail is at (1,4). After move, the tail moves to (1,5), so (1,4) becomes free, but (2,6) is now occupied by segment 7, which was at (1,6) and moves to (2,6).\n> \n> So (2,6) remains occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, for (5,4), it is occupied by segment 1. After move, segment 1 moves to where head was, (6,4), so (5,4) is now occupied by segment 2, which moves there.\n> \n> So to free up a cell that has food under it, we need the snake to move so that no segment is on that cell anymore, which means the tail must pass over it or something.\n> \n> Since the snake is moving, a cell becomes free only if it was the tail position and no food eaten, or if the snake moves away and no segment fills it.\n> \n> But for a body cell, when the snake moves, the cell is immediately filled by the next segment, so it never becomes free unless that segment was the tail and we don't eat food.\n> \n> Specifically, for a position P occupied by segment K, after move, segment K moves to the position of segment K-1, and segment K+1 moves to P.\n> \n> So P is now occupied by segment K+1.\n> \n> Therefore, the only way for a cell to become empty is if it was occupied by the tail and we don't eat food, then tail moves away, and it's free.\n> \n> Otherwise, body cells are always occupied when the snake moves without eating.\n> \n> For food under body, to eat it, we need the tail to be on that cell, and then when we move without eating food, the tail moves away, and the cell is free, then later head can move onto it.\n> \n> But in this case, for (2,6), it is occupied by segment 6, not tail. Tail is at (1,4).\n> \n> The tail will move to (1,5) after one move, then to (1,6) or wherever.\n> \n> To have (2,6) free, we need segment 6 to be the last segment or something, but it's not.\n> \n> The food at (2,6) can only be eaten if the snake moves such that the segment on it moves away and no other segment moves in, but from above, when the snake moves, if the cell was not tail, it remains occupied.\n> \n> So the only time a non-tail body cell becomes free is if the snake shortens or something, but we don't shorten, only grow or stay same length.\n> \n> Since we can only grow by eating food, but for a cell with food under body, to access it, we need to have that cell be the tail when we move away.\n> \n> That is, we need to move the tail to that position.\n> \n> For example, to eat food at P, if P is under body, we need to have the tail on P at some point, then when we move the snake without eating food, the tail moves away, P is free, then head can move to P later.\n> \n> But the head might not be able to reach it easily.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,6), it is segment 6. The tail is segment 9 at (1,4).\n> \n> After moves, the tail will move.\n> \n> But to have (2,6) become tail, we need the snake to move in a way that the segment on (2,6) becomes the tail, which means we need to eat food to grow, but eating food makes the tail stay, so the cell doesn't become free.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Suppose a cell P has food and is occupied by segment K.\n> \n> If we move and eat food elsewhere, the snake grows, so segment K is still there, and P remains occupied.\n> \n> If we don't eat food, segment K moves to the position of segment K-1, and segment K+1 moves to P, so P is still occupied.\n> \n> The only way for P to become free is if, when the tail is on P, and we move without eating food, then the tail moves away, and P is free.\n> \n> But for P to be the tail, it must be that segment K is the last segment.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,6), it is segment 6, and there are segments 7,8,9 after it, so it is not the tail. To make it the tail, we need to have the snake consume the segments after it, but we can't remove segments, only add.\n> \n> So it's impossible to make (2,6) the tail unless we eat food to grow the front, but the tail remains the same.\n> \n> When we eat food, the tail doesn't move, so the segment at tail position stays.\n> \n> But for (2,6), it's not the tail, so we can never free it by moving, because the snake is connected, and as long as there are segments behind it, when the snake moves, those segments will occupy the positions.\n> \n> Specifically, for any body segment that is not the tail, when the snake moves, the cell it occupied is taken by the next segment.\n> \n> So the only cell that can be freed is the tail position when we move without eating food.\n> \n> For a food under a non-tail body segment, it can only be eaten if the head is already on it, but head is not on it, and to have head on it, it must be free, which it never is, so it's impossible to eat food that is under a non-tail body segment because the cell is always occupied and head can't move there.\n> \n> But the rules say: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> But from above, the body never moves away from a non-tail cell; it's always occupied.\n> \n> Unless the snake moves in such a way that the segment on it is the last one to leave, but since segments move in order, it's always occupied.\n> \n> Perhaps if the snake turns and the body follows, but the cell is vacated for a moment? No, because the movement is discrete; at each turn, the positions are updated simultaneously, so after move, the cell is immediately occupied by the next segment.\n> \n> So there is no time when the cell is free; it's always occupied by some segment until the tail leaves it.\n> \n> But for a cell that was occupied by segment K, when segment K moves away, segment K+1 moves in at the same time, so it's never empty.\n> \n> The only exception is the tail position: when the tail moves away, if no food eaten, it becomes empty.\n> \n> For a non-tail cell with food, it can never be eaten because it's never accessible to the head.\n> \n> But that can't be right; the rules imply it is possible.\n> \n> Let me read the rules again.\n> \n> \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> But in practice, for a body cell that is not the tail, when the body moves away, the next body segment moves in, so it's not away; it's still occupied.\n> \n> Perhaps \"the body moves away\" means that in subsequent turns, the snake has moved so that no segment is on that cell.\n> \n> For that to happen, the tail must be on that cell at some point, and then when the tail moves away, it becomes free.\n> \n> For example, to eat food at P under body, we need to have the tail on P, then move without eating food, so tail moves, P is free, then later head can move to P.\n> \n> But at that point, the food might have disappeared or something.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,6), it is segment 6. The tail is at (1,4). The snake would need to move so that the tail reaches (2,6).\n> \n> Currently, the tail is at (1,4), and the body is (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), etc.\n> \n> To move the tail to (2,6), we need to eat food or move in a way that the tail position changes.\n> \n> The tail position changes when we move without eating food; it moves to the previous position of the second-to-last segment.\n> \n> When we don't eat food, the tail moves to where the penultimate segment was.\n> \n> In this case, to have (2,6) become the tail, we need to have the segments after it be gone, but we can't remove segments, so it's impossible unless we eat food to freeze the tail.\n> \n> When we eat food, the tail stays in place, and we add a new segment at head, so the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> So the tail position only changes when we don't eat food.\n> \n> Let's trace the tail.\n> \n> Current tail at (1,4).\n> \n> If we don't eat food on turn 46, after move, tail moves to where segment 8 was, which is (1,5), since segment 8 is at (1,5), and it moves to where segment 7 was, (1,6), so tail moves to (1,5).\n> \n> Then if not eat, next move tail moves to (1,6), and so on.\n> \n> To have the tail at (2,6), we need to not eat food for several moves until the tail reaches (2,6).\n> \n> Currently, the path to (2,6) is: from tail (1,4), then (1,5), (1,6), then (2,6).\n> \n> After three moves with no food eaten, the tail will be at (2,6).\n> \n> Let's simulate:\n> \n> Current state: positions: 0:(6,4), 1:(5,4), 2:(4,4), 3:(3,4), 4:(3,5), 5:(2,5), 6:(2,6), 7:(1,6), 8:(1,5), 9:(1,4) tail.\n> \n> After one move with no food: head moves to new position, say U to (6,5), then new positions: head (6,5), then 1:(6,4), 2:(5,4), 3:(4,4), 4:(3,4), 5:(3,5), 6:(2,5), 7:(2,6), 8:(1,6), 9:(1,5) tail.

Since it's moving down, from (6,1), moving down would go to (6,0), but y=0 is a wall, so that would be a wall collision. Moving down from (6,1) to (6,0) is invalid because y=0 is a wall. Therefore, the snake cannot move down; it would die immediately.\n> \n> Current head direction is D (down), but at (6,1), moving down to (6,0) is impossible since y=0 is a border wall. So, the snake must change direction to avoid moving into the wall.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,1):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (6,2)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (6,0) — wall, invalid\n> \n> - Left (L): to (5,1)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (7,1) — but x=7 is wall, invalid\n> \n> x=7 is border, so R to (7,1) is invalid.\n> \n> So only possible moves are U to (6,2) or L to (5,1).\n> \n> But U to (6,2): (6,2) is a body segment? Snake positions: head (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), etc. So (6,2) is the second segment, which is the body.

Let's see the snake positions: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6). So (5,1) is not in the list, and no walls there except borders, and (5,1) is within 1 to 6 in both x and y? x=5, y=1, y=1 is not wall, walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is playable.

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State (Turn 50)\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state at Turn 50 based on the previous plan:\n\n- **Snake Positions**: After moving left to (5,1) at Turn 49, the snake's new positions are:\n  - Head: (5,1)\n  - Body: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]\n  - Tail: (2,5)\n\n- **Snake Head Direction**: Left (L), since the last move was left to (5,1).\n\n- **Food Items**:\n  - (2,6): Value 1, Life Span 1 (will disappear after Turn 50)\n  - (1,1): Value 1, Life Span 3 (disappears after Turn 52)\n  - (5,4): Value 1, Life Span 6 (disappears after Turn 55)\n  - (2,4): Value 1, Life Span 9 (disappears after Turn 58)\n\n- **Walls and Obstacles**:\n  - Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n  - Internal obstacle at (3,2).\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 50\n\nFrom the head position (5,1), moving left (L) to (4,1) or up (U) to (5,2) are the only viable options because:\n\n- **Down (D)**: (5,0) is a wall (y=0).\n- **Right (R)**: (6,1) is occupied by the body (second segment).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the two possible moves:\n\n1. **Move Left (L) to (4,1)**:\n   - New head: (4,1)\n   - Body segments shift: (5,1) becomes the first body segment, (6,1) the second, etc., and the tail (2,5) is removed.\n   - New positions: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)]\n   - Tail is now at (3,5).\n\n   From (4,1), possible next moves:\n   - Up (U) to (4,2)\n   - Left (L) to (3,1)\n   - Down (D) to (4,0) is a wall.\n   - Right (R) to (5,1) is body (second segment).\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (5,2)**:\n   - New head: (5,2)\n   - Body segments shift: (5,1) becomes first body segment, (6,1) second, etc., tail (2,5) removed.\n   - New positions: [(5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)]\n   - Tail is now at (3,5).\n\n   From (5,2), possible next moves:\n   - Up (U) to (5,3)\n   - Left (L) to (4,2)\n   - Down (D) to (5,1) is body (second segment).\n   - Right (R) to (6,2) is body (fourth segment).\n\n### Evaluating the Moves\n\n**Option 1: Move Left (L) to (4,1)**\n\n- **Pros**:\n  - Moves towards the left side where there's more open space.\n  - Positions the snake to potentially reach (2,4) food in the future.\n  - Avoids the dense body cluster on the right.\n\n- **Cons**:\n  - (2,6) food will disappear after this turn, but it's not reachable in one move anyway.\n  - Might delay reaching other food items like (5,4).\n\n**Option 2: Move Up (U) to (5,2)**\n\n- **Pros**:\n  - Moves towards the center, potentially opening up more options.\n  - Keeps the snake in a position where it might vacate (5,4) for future eating.\n\n- **Cons**:\n  - The body is more clustered on the right, which might limit future moves.\n  - Doesn't directly aim for any immediate food.\n\n### Considering the Previous Plan\n\nThe previous plan at Turn 49 suggested moving left to (5,1) and then continuing left to (4,1) at Turn 50 to eventually reach (2,4) for food. This seems like a reasonable path because:\n\n- (2,4) is a positive food with a long life span (until Turn 58).\n- Moving left initially avoids the body cluster and the obstacle at (3,2).\n- It provides a clear path towards the food without immediate risks.\n\n### Immediate Decision at Turn 50\n\nGiven the above, the best immediate action at Turn 50 is to continue with the previous plan and move left to (4,1). This maintains the trajectory towards the (2,4) food and avoids potential body collisions or dead ends.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Since it's moving down, from (6,1), moving down would go to (6,0), but y=0 is a wall, so that would be a wall collision. Moving down from (6,1) to (6,0) is invalid because y=0 is a wall. Therefore, the snake cannot move down; it would die immediately.\n> \n> Current head direction is D (down), but at (6,1), moving down to (6,0) is impossible since y=0 is a border wall. So, the snake must change direction to avoid moving into the wall.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,1):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (6,2)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (6,0) — wall, invalid\n> \n> - Left (L): to (5,1)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (7,1) — but x=7 is wall, invalid\n> \n> x=7 is border, so R to (7,1) is invalid.\n> \n> So only possible moves are U to (6,2) or L to (5,1).\n> \n> But U to (6,2): (6,2) is a body segment? Snake positions: head (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), etc. So (6,2) is the second segment, which is the body. Moving to (6,2) would cause a collision because head touches body immediately.\n> \n> Positions: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), ...] so (6,2) is directly below the head and is occupied by the body. If I move up to (6,2), that's where the body is, so it would collide and die.\n> \n> In the movement, when the head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by any body segment except the tail (which might move), it's a collision.\n> \n> Here, (6,2) is occupied by the body, and since the tail is at (2,6), this is not the tail, so moving to (6,2) would cause collision.\n> \n> Therefore, from (6,1), moving U to (6,2) is invalid because of body collision.\n> \n> Moving D to (6,0) is invalid, wall.\n> \n> Moving R to (7,1) is invalid, wall.\n> \n> Only possible move is L to (5,1).\n> \n> Is (5,1) free? Let's see the snake positions: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6). So (5,1) is not in the list, and no walls there except borders, and (5,1) is within 1 to 6 in both x and y? x=5, y=1, y=1 is not wall, walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is playable. Internal obstacle at (3,2), not (5,1). So (5,1) should be free.\n> \n> Therefore, the only possible safe move at turn 49 is L to (5,1).\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (2,6), which is the tail, and it has life span 2. Since current turn is 49, it will disappear after 2 turns, so at turn 51 it will be gone if not eaten.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 49, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 50? Let's see: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> For food at (2,6): life span 2 at turn 49. After turn 49, life span becomes 1. After turn 50, life span becomes 0, and it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 49 or 50.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (1,1) life span 4, so disappears after turn 52? After turn 49, span 3; turn 50, span 2; turn 51, span 1; turn 52, span 0, gone.\n> \n> (5,4) life span 7, disappears after turn 55.\n> \n> (2,4) life span 10, disappears after turn 58.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,1), moving to (5,1) on turn 49.\n> \n> After moving to (5,1), the head direction was D, but now we moved L, so new direction is L.\n> \n> Snake positions after turn 49: head moves to (5,1), and the tail might move if we don't eat food.

According to rules, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) has food, and (6,3) is position 6 in snake, so also under body.\n> \n> (2,4) has food, which is not occupied by snake.\n> \n> (1,1) has food, not occupied.\n> \n> Now back to current move: from (2,1), I can go L to (1,1) or U to (2,2).\n> \n> If I go L to (1,1), I eat the food there, since it's positive food, snake length increases by 1, so after eating, snake will have 11 segments. New head at (1,1), and tail stays or moves? When you eat, the tail doesn't move this turn, so the snake grows.\n> \n> Movement: when you move to a cell with food, you eat it, and the snake grows, so the new position is added to head, tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> If no food, head moves to new cell, tail moves off the last cell.\n> \n> So if I move to (1,1), which has food, I eat it, so new head at (1,1), and the tail remains at (4,4) for now? No: the snake moves: head moves to new cell, and if food eaten, no tail movement, so the segment that was tail stays, and new head added.\n> \n> After move: head is at new position, and if food eaten, the previous tail remains, so snake length increases by one.\n> \n> If not, tail moves to the second last or something. Standard snake: when head moves to a cell without food, head moves, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed. With food, head moves, body follows, but tail doesn't move, so new cell added at head.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after moving to a cell with food, the positions list: new head at food cell, then the previous positions from head to before tail, and tail stays in place? No.\n> \n> Example: suppose snake positions [A, B, C], head A, tail C.\n> \n> Move to D with food: new positions [D, A, B, C], so head D, tail C, length 4.\n> \n> Move to D without food: new positions [D, A, B], head D, tail B, length 3.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (1,1) with food, new head at (1,1), then previous head (2,1) becomes second, and so on, up to tail (4,4) remains, so snake becomes [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)] — that's 11 positions, yes.\n> \n> Now, if I go U to (2,2), no food there, so head moves to (2,2), then positions become [(2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4)] and tail (4,4) is removed? When no food, tail moves off.\n> \n> Positions: current [ (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ] 10 segments.\n> \n> After moving head to (2,2) without eating: new head (2,2), then the next segments: (2,1) becomes second, (3,1) third, ..., up to (5,4) ninth, and tail (4,4) is removed, so new positions: [(2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4)] — (5,4) is now the tail? Let's list indices:\n> \n> Current: index 0: (2,1), 1: (3,1), 2: (4,1), 3: (5,1), 4: (6,1), 5: (6,2), 6: (6,3), 7: (6,4), 8: (5,4), 9: (4,4)\n> \n> After move U to (2,2) no eat: head to (2,2), then segment 0 moves to (2,2)? No: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one.\n> \n> So new head: (2,2)\n> \n> Then segment 0 (old head) becomes new segment 1: (2,1)\n> \n> Segment 1 becomes new segment 2: (3,1)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Up to segment 8 becomes new segment 9: (5,4)\n> \n> And segment 9 (tail) is removed, so new positions: [ (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4) ] — so tail is (5,4), and (4,4) is gone.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move L to (1,1) and eat, new positions: [ (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ] — all segments kept, tail (4,4).\n> \n> Now, back to decision.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize survival.\n> \n> If I go L to (1,1), I eat the food, snake grows to 11, but I'm at (1,1), which is corner? (1,1) has walls at (0,1) and (1,0), so only two exits: right to (2,1) or up to (1,2)? But (2,1) is now the second segment, so I can't go there.\n> \n> After move to (1,1), head at (1,1), body at (2,1), etc.\n> \n> From (1,1), possible moves: U to (1,2), R to (2,1) but (2,1) is body, collision, so invalid. D to (1,0) y=0 wall, invalid. L to (0,1) x=0 wall, invalid. So only possible move is U to (1,2).\n> \n> Then from (1,2), I can go U, D, L, R, but need to see surroundings.\n> \n> (1,2) is y=2, x=1.\n> \n> Possible: U to (1,3), D to (1,1) but (1,1) is now body? After first move, positions: [ (1,1), (2,1), ... (4,4) ] so (1,1) is occupied by body, so I can't move back. L to (0,2) wall, R to (2,2).\n> \n> So from (1,2), I can go U to (1,3) or R to (2,2).\n> \n> If I go to (1,2), then depending on direction.\n> \n> But this seems risky because I'm trapped in the corner with few options.\n> \n> Moreover, if I go to (1,1), I must go to (1,2) next, no choice.\n> \n> Then from (1,2), say I go to (1,3) or (2,2).\n> \n> But let's see the grid.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), so (3,2) blocked.\n> \n> Also, food at (2,4), (5,4), etc.\n> \n> But if I go to (1,1), I might get stuck.\n> \n> Now, the other option: U to (2,2).\n> \n> From (2,1) go U to (2,2), no food, so snake moves, tail shortens? When no eat, tail moves off, so length decreases? No, in snake, when no food eaten, the length stays the same, but the tail moves, so the snake doesn't grow, but doesn't shrink; it moves forward.\n> \n> In terms of positions, after moving to (2,2) no eat, positions: [ (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4) ] — so head (2,2), tail (5,4), length 10.\n> \n> Now from (2,2), I can move U, D, L, R.\n> \n> Current direction after move: I moved U, so head direction is now U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1) but (2,1) is now the second segment, so collision, invalid. L to (1,2), R to (3,2) but (3,2) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n> \n> So from (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3) or L to (1,2).\n> \n> Now, (1,2) is empty? Currently no food or snake there, I think.\n> \n> Food: (1,1) but that's different, (2,4) is food, etc.\n> \n> (1,2) not listed as food, so empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,3) empty.\n> \n> So from (2,2), I can go U to (2,3) or L to (1,2).\n> \n> If I go U to (2,3), then from there, etc.\n> \n> Or L to (1,2), which might lead to corner.\n> \n> But let's think about the food with short life.\n> \n> Food at (1,1) has life span 1, so only available this turn. If I don't eat it now, it disappears forever.\n> \n> Food at (5,4) has life span 3, so available for 3 turns including this one.\n> \n> (2,4) life span 6, (6,3) life span 9.\n> \n> So (1,1) is urgent.\n> \n> But eating it might be dangerous.\n> \n> Also, there's a rule about tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, tail is at (4,4), head at (2,1), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing edge, so (2,1) and (4,4) are not adjacent; (2,1) to (3,1) is adjacent, but tail is far.\n> \n> So not an issue here.\n> \n> Now, let's consider the move to (1,1).\n> \n> If I go L to (1,1), I eat food, grow to 11 segments.\n> \n> Then I must go U to (1,2) next turn.\n> \n> From (1,2), I can go U to (1,3) or R to (2,2).\n> \n> (2,2) is currently empty, but after I move, it might be occupied.\n> \n> After turn 53: if I go L to (1,1), positions: [ (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ]\n> \n> Turn 54: from (1,1), only U to (1,2), since other moves invalid.\n> \n> After moving U to (1,2), if (1,2) has no food, then head to (1,2), tail moves off, so new positions: [ (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4) ] — tail is (5,4), and (4,4) removed? Let's see: after eating at turn 53, snake has 11 segments. When moving to (1,2) without eating, head to (1,2), then each segment moves: new segment 1: (1,1), segment 2: (2,1), ..., up to segment 10: (6,4), and segment 11: (5,4) becomes new tail, but (5,4) is still there, and (4,4) is removed.\n> \n> Positions: old [ (1,1), (2,1), ..., (4,4) ] 11 segments.\n> \n> After move to (1,2) no eat: new head (1,2), then new segment 1: old head (1,1), new segment 2: old segment 1 (2,1), ..., new segment 10: old segment 9 (5,4), new segment 11: old segment 10 (4,4) but since no eat, tail is removed, so only 10 segments: [ (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) ] — and (5,4) is included, but (4,4) is gone. Old segment 8 is (5,4)? Let's index old positions turn 53 after eat: index 0: (1,1), 1: (2,1), 2: (3,1), 3: (4,1), 4: (5,1), 5: (6,1), 6: (6,2), 7: (6,3), 8: (6,4), 9: (5,4), 10: (4,4)\n> \n> After move to (1,2) no eat: new head (1,2)\n> \n> New segment 1: old head (1,1)\n> \n> New segment 2: old segment 1 (2,1)\n> \n> New segment 3: old segment 2 (3,1)\n> \n> New segment 4: old segment 3 (4,1)\n> \n> New segment 5: old segment 4 (5,1)\n> \n> New segment 6: old segment 5 (6,1)\n> \n> New segment 7: old segment 6 (6,2)\n> \n> New segment 8: old segment 7 (6,3)\n> \n> New segment 9: old segment 8 (6,4)\n> \n> New segment 10: old segment 9 (5,4)\n> \n> Old segment 10 (4,4) is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: [ (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) ] and (5,4) is now segment 10, tail.\n> \n> (6,4) is segment 9, (6,3) segment 8, etc.\n> \n> Now from (1,2), I can go U to (1,3) or R to (2,2).\n> \n> (2,2) is empty now.\n> \n> If I go R to (2,2), then from there, etc.\n> \n> But I have to think ahead.\n> \n> Alternatively, if I don't eat the (1,1) food, it disappears, and I go U to (2,2).\n> \n> Turn 53: move U to (2,2), no eat, positions: [ (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4) ] tail at (5,4)\n> \n> From (2,2), as before, can go U to (2,3) or L to (1,2).\n> \n> (1,2) is empty.\n> \n> If I go U to (2,3), then from (2,3), I can go U, D, L, R.\n> \n> D to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, invalid.

According to rules, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) has food, and (6,3) is position 6 in snake, so also under body.\n> \n> (2,4) has food, which is not occupied by snake.\n> \n> (1,1) has food, not occupied.\n> \n> Now back to current move: from (2,1), I can go L to (1,1) or U to (2,2).\n> \n> If I go L to (1,1), I eat the food there, since it's positive food, snake length increases by 1, so after eating, snake will have 11 segments. New head at (1,1), and tail stays or moves? When you eat, the tail doesn't move this turn, so the snake grows.\n> \n> Movement: when you move to a cell with food, you eat it, and the snake grows, so the new position is added to head, tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> If no food, head moves to new cell, tail moves off the last cell.\n> \n> So if I move to (1,1), which has food, I eat it, so new head at (1,1), and the tail remains at (4,4) for now? No: the snake moves: head moves to new cell, and if food eaten, no tail movement, so the segment that was tail stays, and new head added.\n> \n> After move: head is at new position, and if food eaten, the previous tail remains, so snake length increases by one.\n> \n> If not, tail moves to the second last or something. Standard snake: when head moves to a cell without food, head moves, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed. With food, head moves, body follows, but tail doesn't move, so new cell added at head.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after moving to a cell with food, the positions list: new head at food cell, then the previous positions from head to before tail, and tail stays in place? No.\n> \n> Example: suppose snake positions [A, B, C], head A, tail C.\n> \n> Move to D with food: new positions [D, A, B, C], so head D, tail C, length 4.\n> \n> Move to D without food: new positions [D, A, B], head D, tail B, length 3.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (1,1) with food, new head at (1,1), then previous head (2,1) becomes second, and so on, up to tail (4,4) remains, so snake becomes [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)] — that's 11 positions, yes.\n> \n> Now, if I go U to (2,2), no food there, so head moves to (2,2), then positions become [(2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4)] and tail (4,4) is removed? When no food, tail moves off.\n> \n> Positions: current [ (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ] 10 segments.\n> \n> After moving head to (2,2) without eating: new head (2,2), then the next segments: (2,1) becomes second, (3,1) third, ..., up to (5,4) ninth, and tail (4,4) is removed, so new positions: [(2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4)] — (5,4) is now the tail? Let's list indices:\n> \n> Current: index 0: (2,1), 1: (3,1), 2: (4,1), 3: (5,1), 4: (6,1), 5: (6,2), 6: (6,3), 7: (6,4), 8: (5,4), 9: (4,4)\n> \n> After move U to (2,2) no eat: head to (2,2), then segment 0 moves to (2,2)? No: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one.\n> \n> So new head: (2,2)\n> \n> Then segment 0 (old head) becomes new segment 1: (2,1)\n> \n> Segment 1 becomes new segment 2: (3,1)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Up to segment 8 becomes new segment 9: (5,4)\n> \n> And segment 9 (tail) is removed, so new positions: [ (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4) ] — so tail is (5,4), and (4,4) is gone.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move L to (1,1) and eat, new positions: [ (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ] — all segments kept, tail (4,4).\n> \n> Now, back to decision.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize survival.\n> \n> If I go L to (1,1), I eat the food, snake grows to 11, but I'm at (1,1), which is corner? (1,1) has walls at (0,1) and (1,0), so only two exits: right to (2,1) or up to (1,2)? But (2,1) is now the second segment, so I can't go there.\n> \n> After move to (1,1), head at (1,1), body at (2,1), etc.\n> \n> From (1,1), possible moves: U to (1,2), R to (2,1) but (2,1) is body, collision, so invalid. D to (1,0) y=0 wall, invalid. L to (0,1) x=0 wall, invalid. So only possible move is U to (1,2).\n> \n> Then from (1,2), I can go U, D, L, R, but need to see surroundings.\n> \n> (1,2) is y=2, x=1.\n> \n> Possible: U to (1,3), D to (1,1) but (1,1) is now body? After first move, positions: [ (1,1), (2,1), ... (4,4) ] so (1,1) is occupied by body, so I can't move back. L to (0,2) wall, R to (2,2).\n> \n> So from (1,2), I can go U to (1,3) or R to (2,2).\n> \n> If I go to (1,2), then depending on direction.\n> \n> But this seems risky because I'm trapped in the corner with few options.\n> \n> Moreover, if I go to (1,1), I must go to (1,2) next, no choice.\n> \n> Then from (1,2), say I go to (1,3) or (2,2).\n> \n> But let's see the grid.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), so (3,2) blocked.\n> \n> Also, food at (2,4), (5,4), etc.\n> \n> But if I go to (1,1), I might get stuck.\n> \n> Now, the other option: U to (2,2).\n> \n> From (2,1) go U to (2,2), no food, so snake moves, tail shortens? When no eat, tail moves off, so length decreases? No, in snake, when no food eaten, the length stays the same, but the tail moves, so the snake doesn't grow, but doesn't shrink; it moves forward.\n> \n> In terms of positions, after moving to (2,2) no eat, positions: [ (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4) ] — so head (2,2), tail (5,4), length 10.\n> \n> Now from (2,2), I can move U, D, L, R.\n> \n> Current direction after move: I moved U, so head direction is now U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1) but (2,1) is now the second segment, so collision, invalid. L to (1,2), R to (3,2) but (3,2) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n> \n> So from (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3) or L to (1,2).\n> \n> Now, (1,2) is empty? Currently no food or snake there, I think.\n> \n> Food: (1,1) but that's different, (2,4) is food, etc.\n> \n> (1,2) not listed as food, so empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,3) empty.\n> \n> So from (2,2), I can go U to (2,3) or L to (1,2).\n> \n> If I go U to (2,3), then from there, etc.\n> \n> Or L to (1,2), which might lead to corner.\n> \n> But let's think about the food with short life.\n> \n> Food at (1,1) has life span 1, so only available this turn. If I don't eat it now, it disappears forever.\n> \n> Food at (5,4) has life span 3, so available for 3 turns including this one.\n> \n> (2,4) life span 6, (6,3) life span 9.\n> \n> So (1,1) is urgent.\n> \n> But eating it might be dangerous.\n> \n> Also, there's a rule about tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, tail is at (4,4), head at (2,1), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing edge, so (2,1) and (4,4) are not adjacent; (2,1) to (3,1) is adjacent, but tail is far.\n> \n> So not an issue here.\n> \n> Now, let's consider the move to (1,1).\n> \n> If I go L to (1,1), I eat food, grow to 11 segments.\n> \n> Then I must go U to (1,2) next turn.\n> \n> From (1,2), I can go U to (1,3) or R to (2,2).\n> \n> (2,2) is currently empty, but after I move, it might be occupied.\n> \n> After turn 53: if I go L to (1,1), positions: [ (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ]\n> \n> Turn 54: from (1,1), only U to (1,2), since other moves invalid.\n> \n> After moving U to (1,2), if (1,2) has no food, then head to (1,2), tail moves off, so new positions: [ (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4) ] — tail is (5,4), and (4,4) removed? Let's see: after eating at turn 53, snake has 11 segments. When moving to (1,2) without eating, head to (1,2), then each segment moves: new segment 1: (1,1), segment 2: (2,1), ..., up to segment 10: (6,4), and segment 11: (5,4) becomes new tail, but (5,4) is still there, and (4,4) is removed.\n> \n> Positions: old [ (1,1), (2,1), ..., (4,4) ] 11 segments.\n> \n> After move to (1,2) no eat: new head (1,2), then new segment 1: old head (1,1), new segment 2: old segment 1 (2,1), ..., new segment 10: old segment 9 (5,4), new segment 11: old segment 10 (4,4) but since no eat, tail is removed, so only 10 segments: [ (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) ] — and (5,4) is included, but (4,4) is gone. Old segment 8 is (5,4)? Let's index old positions turn 53 after eat: index 0: (1,1), 1: (2,1), 2: (3,1), 3: (4,1), 4: (5,1), 5: (6,1), 6: (6,2), 7: (6,3), 8: (6,4), 9: (5,4), 10: (4,4)\n> \n> After move to (1,2) no eat: new head (1,2)\n> \n> New segment 1: old head (1,1)\n> \n> New segment 2: old segment 1 (2,1)\n> \n> New segment 3: old segment 2 (3,1)\n> \n> New segment 4: old segment 3 (4,1)\n> \n> New segment 5: old segment 4 (5,1)\n> \n> New segment 6: old segment 5 (6,1)\n> \n> New segment 7: old segment 6 (6,2)\n> \n> New segment 8: old segment 7 (6,3)\n> \n> New segment 9: old segment 8 (6,4)\n> \n> New segment 10: old segment 9 (5,4)\n> \n> Old segment 10 (4,4) is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: [ (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) ] and (5,4) is now segment 10, tail.\n> \n> (6,4) is segment 9, (6,3) segment 8, etc.\n> \n> Now from (1,2), I can go U to (1,3) or R to (2,2).\n> \n> (2,2) is empty now.\n> \n> If I go R to (2,2), then from there, etc.\n> \n> But I have to think ahead.\n> \n> Alternatively, if I don't eat the (1,1) food, it disappears, and I go U to (2,2).\n> \n> Turn 53: move U to (2,2), no eat, positions: [ (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4) ] tail at (5,4)\n> \n> From (2,2), as before, can go U to (2,3) or L to (1,2).\n> \n> (1,2) is empty.\n> \n> If I go U to (2,3), then from (2,3), I can go U, D, L, R.\n> \n> D to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, invalid.

No: when you eat, the head moves to new cell, and the body follows, but since tail doesn't move, the length increases. So positions: [new head (2,4), then previous head (2,3) now first body, then (2,2), ..., down to (6,4) which is now the second last, and tail is still (6,4) but since we add a segment, the tail position remains for that turn? I need to clarify the movement.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: each turn, the head moves to a new cell.

No: when you eat, the head moves to new cell, and the body follows, but since tail doesn't move, the length increases.

Cannot move L (left) as it's opposite to current direction R.\n- **Food**: At (6, 3), value +1, life span 6 (will disappear after turn 62). Currently under the snake's body (not the tail).\n- **Tail**: At (6, 4).\n\n### Goal:\nEat the food at (6, 3) safely before it disappears (by turn 62). To do this:\n1. The body segment at (6, 3) must move away (i.e., it must become the tail and then the tail moves away).\n2. The head must then move to (6, 3) when it's free.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Turn 57**: Move in a direction that progresses the snake toward freeing (6, 3) and eventually reaching it.\n   - Moving right (R) to (4, 4) is a good choice because:\n     - It progresses the snake toward the right side where the food is.\n     - After this move, the tail will be at (6, 3) (food location), and (6, 4) will be freed.\n   - Moving up (U) or down (D) would not directly help free (6, 3) as quickly.\n\n2. **Subsequent Moves** (simulated for clarity):\n   - **Turn 57**: Move R to (4, 4). New tail is at (6, 3) (food location).\n   - **Turn 58**: Move R to (5, 4). Now (6, 3) is freed (tail moves to (6, 2)), and food is exposed at (6, 3).\n   - **Turn 59**: Move R to (6, 4). Now the head is adjacent to (6, 3) (food location).\n   - **Turn 60**: Move D to (6, 3) to eat the food. \n     - **Danger Check**: Head is adjacent to tail (which is at (6, 2)), but the food is at (6, 3), not under the tail. No Tail Reward Danger here because the tail is not on the food cell when eating.\n\n### Immediate Action (Turn 57):\nMove right (R) to (4, 4) to start the sequence toward the food.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{R}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 57 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(3, 2)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: R\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (6, 3, 6, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 57 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 57. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls are on the borders. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,4), then body segments at (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). So the snake is 12 segments long. Head direction is right (R), meaning it was moving to the east when it arrived at (3,4).\n> \n> Food: There's one food at (6,3) with value 1 and life span 6. Since it's turn 57, and life span decreases every turn, including current, this food will disappear after turn 62 (57 + 6 - 1? Let's calculate: life span 6 means it has 6 turns left including this one, so it disappears after turn 62. On turn 63 it's gone.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 57, life span is 6, meaning it can be eaten from turn 57 to 62 inclusive. On turn 63, it's gone.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. The food at (6,3) is positive with value +1, so eating it would increase snake length by 1.\n> \n> But I have to be careful about collisions. Walls are at borders and (3,2). Also, the snake body: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n> \n> Food is at (6,3). But (6,3) is currently occupied by the snake's body! Specifically, it's the 11th segment in the list, index 10 if 0-based. Positions: head (0) at (3,4), then (1): (2,4), (2): (2,3), (3): (2,2), (4): (2,1), (5): (3,1), (6): (4,1), (7): (5,1), (8): (6,1), (9): (6,2), (10): (6,3), (11): (6,4). So (6,3) is the second last segment, the tail is at (6,4).\n> \n> Food is at (6,3), but that cell is occupied by the snake body. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> So, to eat this food, the snake needs to move such that the segment at (6,3) moves away, and then the head moves to (6,3). But since the snake moves one cell per turn, and the body follows, I need to plan a path.\n> \n> Also, head direction is R, so from (3,4), moving right would go to (4,4), but let's see possible moves.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,4), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> But cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so cannot move L (left) immediately.\n> \n> Also, walls: borders, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> So for head at (3,4):\n> \n> - U: to (3,5) – is this valid? y=5, within 0 to 7, not a wall? Walls are only borders and (3,2), so (3,5) should be free, but need to check if occupied by body.\n> \n> Body positions: list all: (3,4) head, (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n> \n> So (3,5) is not in this list, so it's free. Similarly, (4,4) is not in list, free. (3,3): not in list, free. (3,4) is head, so adjacent cells.\n> \n> Adjacent cells to head (3,4):\n> \n> - Up: (3,5) – not occupied, not wall\n> \n> - Down: (3,3) – not occupied? (3,3) is not in snake positions, so free. Walls: (3,3) is within bounds, not border wall, not (3,2), so free.\n> \n> - Left: (2,4) – but (2,4) is the first body segment, occupied. Also, moving left is opposite to current direction R? Current direction is R, so moving left is opposite, and not allowed. Cannot move L.\n> \n> - Right: (4,4) – not occupied, free.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,4): U, D, R. Cannot L because opposite direction.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about getting to the food at (6,3).\n> \n> Food at (6,3) is under the body segment at (6,3). When the snake moves, the body will move away if the head moves and the tail follows.\n> \n> The snake moves step by step. On each turn, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail end is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> Currently, food is under (6,3), which is not the tail; tail is at (6,4).\n> \n> To eat the food at (6,3), we need that cell to be free when the head moves there. That means the segment currently at (6,3) must have moved away by that time.\n> \n> Since the snake moves, in subsequent turns, positions change.\n> \n> Also, there's a danger: Tail Reward Danger. If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, food is at (6,3), which is not the tail; tail is (6,4). So if head moves to (6,3) after the body has moved, it should be ok, but we need to ensure that when head moves to (6,3), it's not occupied, and also after eating, the new tail doesn't cause collision.\n> \n> Let's simulate possible paths.\n> \n> First, I should consider the food life span: it disappears after turn 62, so we have from turn 57 to 62 to eat it, 6 turns including 57.\n> \n> Turn 57: current turn, we choose action.\n> \n> Then turns 58,59,60,61,62: we can act to eat it on or before turn 62.\n> \n> Since life span decreases every turn, including current, at turn 57, life span 6, so it can be eaten on turns 57,58,59,60,61,62. On turn 63 gone.\n> \n> But to eat it, we need head to be on (6,3) when it's free.\n> \n> Currently, (6,3) is occupied by body.\n> \n> When does it become free? The snake will move, so the body at (6,3) will move to where the next segment is going, but it depends on the movement.\n> \n> The segment at (6,3) is part of the body; it will move to (6,2) or wherever the segment ahead moves, but it's a chain.\n> \n> Let's list the snake positions in order: indices 0 to 11: (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n> \n> The head is at (3,4). If we move, say, right to (4,4), then new head is (4,4), and the body segments shift: segment 1 (was at (2,4)) moves to old head position (3,4)? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front of it.\n> \n> So after head moves to new position, the segment that was at index 1 moves to where index 0 was, index 2 moves to where index 1 was, and so on, up to the tail.\n> \n> Specifically: new positions: head at new cell, then body[0] at old head position, body[1] at old body[0], ..., body[n-1] at old body[n-2], and the old tail position is vacated unless food is eaten.\n> \n> In this case, no food eaten yet.\n> \n> So after one move, the tail moves away from its current position.\n> \n> For example, if head moves right to (4,4) at turn 57.\n> \n> Then new snake positions: head at (4,4), then the segments: the old head (3,4) becomes new body[0], then (2,4) becomes body[1], (2,3) body[2], (2,2) body[3], (2,1) body[4], (3,1) body[5], (4,1) body[6], (5,1) body[7], (6,1) body[8], (6,2) body[9], (6,3) body[10], and the old tail (6,4) is no longer part of snake, so (6,4) is free now.\n> \n> The body segment at (6,3) moves to where?

To eat it:\n     - The tail must move away (freeing (6,3)).\n     - The head must then move to (6,3) when it is free.\n\n### Plan Execution (Following Previous Guidance)\n- The previous plan (from Turn 57) was:\n  - Turn 57: R to (4,4).\n  - Turn 58: R to (5,4).\n  - Turn 59: R to (6,4).\n  - Turn 60: D to (6,3) to eat the food.\n\n### Immediate Action for Turn 58\nFrom (4,4), move **R to (5,4)** to continue the plan. This will:\n- Move the tail from (6,3) to (6,2) (freeing (6,3) for future eating).\n- Keep the path clear for reaching (6,3) by Turn 60.\n\n### Verification\n- After moving to (5,4):\n  - New head: (5,4).\n  - Body: [(4,4), (3,4), ..., (6,2)].\n  - Tail at (6,2).\n  - (6,3) is now free with food, and the head is not adjacent to the tail (no Tail Reward Danger).\n\n### Final Decision\nFollow the plan: move **R (right)** to (5,4).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

It's turn 57. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls are on the borders. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,4), then body segments at (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). So the snake is 12 segments long. Head direction is right (R), meaning it was moving to the east when it arrived at (3,4).\n> \n> Food: There's one food at (6,3) with value 1 and life span 6. Since it's turn 57, and life span decreases every turn, including current, this food will disappear after turn 62 (57 + 6 - 1? Let's calculate: life span 6 means it has 6 turns left including this one, so it disappears after turn 62. On turn 63 it's gone.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 57, life span is 6, meaning it can be eaten from turn 57 to 62 inclusive. On turn 63, it's gone.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. The food at (6,3) is positive with value +1, so eating it would increase snake length by 1.\n> \n> But I have to be careful about collisions. Walls are at borders and (3,2). Also, the snake body: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n> \n> Food is at (6,3). But (6,3) is currently occupied by the snake's body! Specifically, it's the 11th segment in the list, index 10 if 0-based. Positions: head (0) at (3,4), then (1): (2,4), (2): (2,3), (3): (2,2), (4): (2,1), (5): (3,1), (6): (4,1), (7): (5,1), (8): (6,1), (9): (6,2), (10): (6,3), (11): (6,4). So (6,3) is the second last segment, the tail is at (6,4).\n> \n> Food is at (6,3), but that cell is occupied by the snake body. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> So, to eat this food, the snake needs to move such that the segment at (6,3) moves away, and then the head moves to (6,3). But since the snake moves one cell per turn, and the body follows, I need to plan a path.\n> \n> Also, head direction is R, so from (3,4), moving right would go to (4,4), but let's see possible moves.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,4), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> But cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so cannot move L (left) immediately.\n> \n> Also, walls: borders, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> So for head at (3,4):\n> \n> - U: to (3,5) – is this valid? y=5, within 0 to 7, not a wall? Walls are only borders and (3,2), so (3,5) should be free, but need to check if occupied by body.\n> \n> Body positions: list all: (3,4) head, (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n> \n> So (3,5) is not in this list, so it's free. Similarly, (4,4) is not in list, free. (3,3): not in list, free. (3,4) is head, so adjacent cells.\n> \n> Adjacent cells to head (3,4):\n> \n> - Up: (3,5) – not occupied, not wall\n> \n> - Down: (3,3) – not occupied? (3,3) is not in snake positions, so free. Walls: (3,3) is within bounds, not border wall, not (3,2), so free.\n> \n> - Left: (2,4) – but (2,4) is the first body segment, occupied. Also, moving left is opposite to current direction R? Current direction is R, so moving left is opposite, and not allowed. Cannot move L.\n> \n> - Right: (4,4) – not occupied, free.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,4): U, D, R. Cannot L because opposite direction.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about getting to the food at (6,3).\n> \n> Food at (6,3) is under the body segment at (6,3). When the snake moves, the body will move away if the head moves and the tail follows.\n> \n> The snake moves step by step. On each turn, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail end is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> Currently, food is under (6,3), which is not the tail; tail is at (6,4).\n> \n> To eat the food at (6,3), we need that cell to be free when the head moves there. That means the segment currently at (6,3) must have moved away by that time.\n> \n> Since the snake moves, in subsequent turns, positions change.\n> \n> Also, there's a danger: Tail Reward Danger. If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, food is at (6,3), which is not the tail; tail is (6,4). So if head moves to (6,3) after the body has moved, it should be ok, but we need to ensure that when head moves to (6,3), it's not occupied, and also after eating, the new tail doesn't cause collision.\n> \n> Let's simulate possible paths.\n> \n> First, I should consider the food life span: it disappears after turn 62, so we have from turn 57 to 62 to eat it, 6 turns including 57.\n> \n> Turn 57: current turn, we choose action.\n> \n> Then turns 58,59,60,61,62: we can act to eat it on or before turn 62.\n> \n> Since life span decreases every turn, including current, at turn 57, life span 6, so it can be eaten on turns 57,58,59,60,61,62. On turn 63 gone.\n> \n> But to eat it, we need head to be on (6,3) when it's free.\n> \n> Currently, (6,3) is occupied by body.\n> \n> When does it become free? The snake will move, so the body at (6,3) will move to where the next segment is going, but it depends on the movement.\n> \n> The segment at (6,3) is part of the body; it will move to (6,2) or wherever the segment ahead moves, but it's a chain.\n> \n> Let's list the snake positions in order: indices 0 to 11: (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n> \n> The head is at (3,4). If we move, say, right to (4,4), then new head is (4,4), and the body segments shift: segment 1 (was at (2,4)) moves to old head position (3,4)? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front of it.\n> \n> So after head moves to new position, the segment that was at index 1 moves to where index 0 was, index 2 moves to where index 1 was, and so on, up to the tail.\n> \n> Specifically: new positions: head at new cell, then body[0] at old head position, body[1] at old body[0], ..., body[n-1] at old body[n-2], and the old tail position is vacated unless food is eaten.\n> \n> In this case, no food eaten yet.\n> \n> So after one move, the tail moves away from its current position.\n> \n> For example, if head moves right to (4,4) at turn 57.\n> \n> Then new snake positions: head at (4,4), then the segments: the old head (3,4) becomes new body[0], then (2,4) becomes body[1], (2,3) body[2], (2,2) body[3], (2,1) body[4], (3,1) body[5], (4,1) body[6], (5,1) body[7], (6,1) body[8], (6,2) body[9], (6,3) body[10], and the old tail (6,4) is no longer part of snake, so (6,4) is free now.\n> \n> The body segment at (6,3) moves to where?

Move **R** to (6, 4) now to set up eating (6, 3) on Turn 60.\n- Avoid growing the snake prematurely by not eating (5, 5) yet.\n\n### Action:\n\\boxed{R}",

It's turn 59. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (3,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4), then (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). So the snake has 12 segments. Head is at (5,4) facing right (R), which means it's moving east.\n> \n> Food: two pieces:\n> \n> - At (6,3) with value 1 and life span 4. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, it will disappear after 4 more turns? Let's see: life span 4 means it has 4 turns left including this one. So after turn 59, it has 3 left; after turn 60, 2; turn 61, 1; turn 62, 0, so it disappears before turn 63. But we need to eat it before it disappears.\n> \n> - Another food at (5,5) with value 1 and life span 9, so it has 9 turns left, which is plenty of time.\n> \n> Both foods are positive, since value is +1. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 59. The head direction is R, so I can move U, D, L, or R, but with no instant reverse. Since it's facing R, reverse would be L, so I cannot move left immediately. Possible moves from (5,4) are: U (up, to (5,5)), D (down, to (5,3)), R (right, to (6,4)), or L (left, to (4,4)), but L is reverse, so I cannot move left because that would be opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so moving L would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. So from (5,4), possible moves are U, D, or R. L is invalid.\n> \n> Also, I need to avoid collisions with walls, obstacles, and body, except for the tail which might move.\n> \n> First, let's list the possible moves from current position (5,4):\n> \n> - U: to (5,5)\n> \n> - D: to (5,3)\n> \n> - R: to (6,4)\n> \n> Now, check what's at these cells.\n> \n> First, (5,5): is there food? Yes, food at (5,5) with value 1. Also, is it a wall? Walls are borders and (3,2). (5,5) is within 0 to 7, so not border wall, and not (3,2), so free. But I need to check if moving there causes collision.\n> \n> Snake body positions: [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n> \n> (5,5) is not in this list, so no body collision if I move there, except that after moving, the tail moves, so it should be fine.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3): not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n> \n> (6,4): not in snake positions? Let's see: (6,1) and (6,2) are body, but (6,4) is not listed, so should be free. But (6,4) is adjacent to (6,3) which has food, but (6,4) itself is empty I think.\n> \n> Food is at (6,3) and (5,5), so (6,4) has no food.\n> \n> Now, if I move to (5,5), I eat the food there, since head moves to it. Value +1, length increases by 1.\n> \n> If I move to (5,3), no food, just move.\n> \n> If I move to (6,4), no food, but close to (6,3) food.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> What is the tail? Current tail is at (6,2). After moving, the tail moves depending on the direction.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed, unless food is eaten, in which case tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, if I eat food, tail stays, else tail moves.\n> \n> Current tail is (6,2).\n> \n> Where is the tail after moves? It depends on the path.\n> \n> But for Tail Reward Danger, it's about the head being adjacent to the tail and the tail cell having food that I eat.\n> \n> But the food on tail can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves on it later.\n> \n> In this state, is there food on the tail? Food positions are (6,3) and (5,5), tail is at (6,2), which has no food, so no issue now.\n> \n> (6,2) is part of the snake, and food is at (6,3), not on (6,2).\n> \n> So no food on body currently, I think.\n> \n> Food at (6,3) and (5,5), snake positions include (6,2) but not (6,3), so (6,3) is free, food is there.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) is free.\n> \n> Now, life span: (6,3) has life span 4, meaning it will disappear after 4 turns including this one. So if not eaten by turn 62, it's gone.\n> \n> (5,5) has life span 9, so more time.\n> \n> I should aim to eat both, but prioritize based on risk and opportunity.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the grid layout.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so cannot go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake is long, 12 segments, so space might be tight.\n> \n> Current head at (5,4), tail at (6,2).\n> \n> If I move up to (5,5), I eat the food, length becomes 13, and the tail doesn't move this turn because I ate food. So new positions: head at (5,5), body: (5,4), (4,4), ..., (6,1), and tail still at (6,2)? No.\n> \n> When I eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the end, so tail stays where it was. But in terms of positions, the tail remains, and a new head is added.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving without eating, head to new cell, tail removed. When eating, head to new cell, no tail removed, so length increases by one.\n> \n> So after eating at (5,5), positions: head (5,5), then previous head (5,4) becomes second segment, and so on, down to tail (6,2), and since I ate, tail doesn't move, so positions: [(5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] — that's 13 segments now.\n> \n> (6,2) is still there, and (6,1) is before it? Let's list: after move to (5,5) and eat, head is (5,5), then the old head (5,4) is now body, then (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), and tail (6,2). But (6,1) and (6,2) are both there, with (6,1) before (6,2) in the list?

(5,4) to (6,3) is not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right. (6,3) is down-right from (5,4), not directly adjacent. From (5,4), adjacent cells are (5,5) up, (5,3) down, (6,4) right, (4,4) left but invalid.\n> \n> (6,3) is not adjacent to (5,4); it's diagonally down-right, so I need to move to a cell that is adjacent to it.\n> \n> For example, from (5,4), I can move to (6,4), then from (6,4) I can move down to (6,3).\n> \n> Similarly, I could go to (5,3), then right to (6,3), but (5,3) to (6,3) is right, which might be possible.\n> \n> But let's think step by step.\n> \n> First, turn 59: I need to choose an action.\n> \n> Options:\n> \n> - U: to (5,5), eat food, length +1 to 13, and I'm at (5,5)\n> \n> - D: to (5,3), no food, to (5,3)\n> \n> - R: to (6,4), no food, to (6,4)\n> \n> If I go U, I eat the food at (5,5), which is good, but then I'm at (5,5), and the food at (6,3) is close but with limited time.\n> \n> If I go R to (6,4), I'm closer to (6,3), and I can eat it next turn if I move down.\n> \n> But let's see risks.\n> \n> Also, after eating, the snake grows, which might make it harder to maneuver.\n> \n> Now, the internal obstacle at (3,2) is there, but not near current position.\n> \n> Walls borders.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the area around (6,3).\n> \n> (6,3) is at x=6,y=3.

But I need to check if moving there causes collision.\n> \n> Snake body positions: [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n> \n> (5,5) is not in this list, so no body collision if I move there, except that after moving, the tail moves, so it should be fine.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3): not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n> \n> (6,4): not in snake positions? Let's see: (6,1) and (6,2) are body, but (6,4) is not listed, so should be free. But (6,4) is adjacent to (6,3) which has food, but (6,4) itself is empty I think.\n> \n> Food is at (6,3) and (5,5), so (6,4) has no food.\n> \n> Now, if I move to (5,5), I eat the food there, since head moves to it. Value +1, length increases by 1.\n> \n> If I move to (5,3), no food, just move.\n> \n> If I move to (6,4), no food, but close to (6,3) food.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> What is the tail? Current tail is at (6,2). After moving, the tail moves depending on the direction.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed, unless food is eaten, in which case tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, if I eat food, tail stays, else tail moves.\n> \n> Current tail is (6,2).\n> \n> Where is the tail after moves? It depends on the path.\n> \n> But for Tail Reward Danger, it's about the head being adjacent to the tail and the tail cell having food that I eat.\n> \n> But the food on tail can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves on it later.\n> \n> In this state, is there food on the tail? Food positions are (6,3) and (5,5), tail is at (6,2), which has no food, so no issue now.\n> \n> (6,2) is part of the snake, and food is at (6,3), not on (6,2).\n> \n> So no food on body currently, I think.\n> \n> Food at (6,3) and (5,5), snake positions include (6,2) but not (6,3), so (6,3) is free, food is there.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) is free.\n> \n> Now, life span: (6,3) has life span 4, meaning it will disappear after 4 turns including this one. So if not eaten by turn 62, it's gone.\n> \n> (5,5) has life span 9, so more time.\n> \n> I should aim to eat both, but prioritize based on risk and opportunity.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the grid layout.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so cannot go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake is long, 12 segments, so space might be tight.\n> \n> Current head at (5,4), tail at (6,2).\n> \n> If I move up to (5,5), I eat the food, length becomes 13, and the tail doesn't move this turn because I ate food. So new positions: head at (5,5), body: (5,4), (4,4), ..., (6,1), and tail still at (6,2)? No.\n> \n> When I eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the end, so tail stays where it was. But in terms of positions, the tail remains, and a new head is added.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving without eating, head to new cell, tail removed. When eating, head to new cell, no tail removed, so length increases by one.\n> \n> So after eating at (5,5), positions: head (5,5), then previous head (5,4) becomes second segment, and so on, down to tail (6,2), and since I ate, tail doesn't move, so positions: [(5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] — that's 13 segments now.\n> \n> (6,2) is still there, and (6,1) is before it?

Long-term survival.\n> \n> Food at (6,3) has short life, only 4 turns left, so I should eat it soon.\n> \n> But to eat (6,3), I need to move to it.\n> \n> From current position (5,4), (6,3) is adjacent? (5,4) to (6,3) is not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right. (6,3) is down-right from (5,4), not directly adjacent.

Not directly helpful for reaching food.\n\n2. **L (Left) to (5, 3)**:\n   - Safe (no collision).\n   - Moves closer to food (food is at x=5; current x=6 → moving to x=5).\n   - Future path: From (5, 3), can move L to (4, 3) or D to (5, 2). Potential to reach (5, 5) via (5, 3) → (5, 4) → (5, 5), but (5, 4) is occupied by body after this move (see below).\n\n### Food Access:\n- **Food at (5, 5)**:\n  - To reach (5, 5), need to go from (5, 3) → (5, 4) → (5, 5).\n  - After moving L to (5, 3), (5, 4) is occupied by body (segment S3). Cannot move U to (5, 4) → **Collision**.\n  - Thus, cannot reach (5, 5) immediately after L move.\n\n- **Food at (5, 6)**:\n  - To reach (5, 6), need to go from (5, 3) → (5, 4) → (5, 5) → (5, 6).\n  - Same issue: (5, 4) is blocked after L move.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Moving **L (Left)** to (5, 3) is better than moving D (Down) because:\n  - It aligns the snake's x-coordinate with the food (x=5).\n  - Even though immediate access to food is blocked, it opens future opportunities (e.g., from (5, 3), move D to (5, 2), then L to (4, 2), etc., to loop around).\n- Moving D (Down) leads to dead ends (bottom row) and away from food.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\\boxed{L}",

That means the grid is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? Let me confirm. Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> - Snake positions: Head is at (6,3), and the body segments follow: [(6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)]. So the snake is 13 segments long. Head direction is down, which is D. Since direction is D, moving down means increasing y? I need to clarify coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, (x,y) with y increasing upwards or downwards? The movement says U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increases upwards, but in many games, y increases downwards. Let's see the movement definitions:\n> \n> - U: (x,y+1) – if y+1, that means y increases as we go up? But in the context, let's see the snake positions.\n> \n> Snake head is at (6,3), and direction is D, which is down. D is (x,y-1) according to the movement constraints. So:\n> \n> - U: (x, y+1) – up\n> \n> - D: (x, y-1) – down\n> \n> - L: (x-1, y) – left\n> \n> - R: (x+1, y) – right\n> \n> Also, walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's list possible coordinates.\n> \n> x=0 to x=7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive. Similarly, y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6 inclusive. So grid is 6x6 cells: x=1,2,3,4,5,6 and y=1,2,3,4,5,6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), which is within the grid.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (5,5) with life span 7, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (5,6) with life span 10, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive food, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for both, and life span given.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 61, for (5,5) life span 7, meaning it will disappear after 7 more turns, so at turn 68. Similarly, (5,6) life span 10, disappears at turn 71.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,3) with direction down. Down is (x,y-1), so from (6,3), moving down would go to (6,2).\n> \n> But let's see where the snake can move.\n> \n> Current head position: (6,3)\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (x,y+1) = (6,4)\n> \n> - D: (x,y-1) = (6,2)\n> \n> - L: (x-1,y) = (5,3)\n> \n> - R: (x+1,y) = (7,3) but x=7 is wall, so not possible.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: current direction is D, so cannot move U immediately, because U is opposite to D? Let's see.\n> \n> Current direction is down (D). Opposite would be up (U). So cannot move U on next turn.\n> \n> Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> So from D, cannot move U.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid collisions.\n> \n> First, list possible moves from (6,3):\n> \n> - U: (6,4) – but is this occupied? Snake body: positions are [(6,3), (6,4), (5,4), ...] so (6,4) is the second segment, which is the body. So if head moves to (6,4), it would collide with the body segment there.\n> \n> Body collision: head touches any body segment. But note the exception: can move into tail cell because tail moves away.\n> \n> Here, (6,4) is not the tail; tail is at (6,1), I think. Snake positions: head (6,3), then (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So tail is (6,1).\n> \n> (6,4) is the segment right after head, so if head moves to (6,4), it would be on top of the current position of the first body segment. Since the body moves, after head moves, the body segments follow, so if head goes to (6,4), the body segment that was at (6,4) will move to where the head was? Let's think how snake movement works.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So if head moves to a new cell, the segment that was behind the head moves to the head's old position, and so on.\n> \n> So if head is at S0, body at S1, S2, ..., Stail.\n> \n> After move, head to new position, S1 moves to S0, S2 to S1, etc., Stail moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> Therefore, if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by S1 (the first body segment), then after the move, S1 moves to S0, so the head is at the new cell, but S1 is no longer there; it moved away. However, during the move, if head goes to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail under certain conditions, it collides.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, for a body segment that is not the tail, if head moves to it, it will cause collision because at the time of move, that cell is occupied and not by the tail.\n> \n> In this case, (6,4) is currently occupied by the first body segment, which is not the tail (tail is at (6,1)), so moving to (6,4) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (5,3): is (5,3) occupied? Look at positions: (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So (5,3) is not in the list, so it should be free, but need to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,3) is x=5,y=3, which is within 1-6, so not wall. Obstacles: internal obstacle at (3,2), not (5,3). So (5,3) should be free.\n> \n> Moving D to (6,2): (6,2) not in snake positions, and not wall or obstacle. y=2, x=6, within bounds.\n> \n> Moving R to (7,3) but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Also, cannot move U because opposite to current direction D.\n> \n> So possible moves:\n> \n> - L: to (5,3) – left\n> \n> - D: to (6,2) – down\n> \n> U is not possible because opposite and also occupied.\n> \n> R is wall.\n> \n> So only L or D.\n> \n> Now, food is at (5,5) and (5,6).\n> \n> (5,5) is at x=5,y=5, and (5,6) at x=5,y=6.\n> \n> But y=6 is the top row? y=7 is wall, so y=6 is within bounds, since y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Grid: y=1 bottom? Since D is y-1, so y decreases down, so y=1 is bottom, y=6 is top? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Movement: U: (x,y+1) so y increases as we go up. D: (x,y-1) so y decreases as we go down.\n> \n> So at (6,3), U to (6,4), D to (6,2).\n> \n> y=1 is the bottom row, y=6 is the top row.\n> \n> Food at (5,5) and (5,6): (5,6) is at y=6, which is the top row, since y=7 is wall.\n> \n> (5,6) is within grid.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> Current turn t1=61.\n> \n> Sequence for turn 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, and so on, but at least 5 turns.\n> \n> Also, think long-term.\n> \n> First, from (6,3), I can go left to (5,3) or down to (6,2).\n> \n> If I go down to (6,2), that is closer to the bottom, but food is up at (5,5) and (5,6).\n> \n> (6,2) to (5,5) is not direct.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid 6x6: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: borders, and obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head (6,3), body: (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n> \n> So the snake is mostly on the right and bottom, with a part going left to (2,4) then down to (2,1) and right to (6,1).\n> \n> Specifically, from head (6,3), it goes up to (6,4), then left to (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), then down to (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), then right to (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1).\n> \n> Tail is at (6,1).\n> \n> Food at (5,5) and (5,6).\n> \n> (5,5) is at row 5, col 5, and (5,6) at row 5, col 6? x=5,y=5 and x=5,y=6.\n> \n> In coordinates, (x,y), so (5,5) is x=5,y=5, (5,6) is x=5,y=6.\n> \n> y=6 is top row.\n> \n> Now, (5,5) is empty?

The description says \"Cells occupied by walls\" and \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\", but x=0 and x=7 are outside the grid, so I think it means that moving to those coordinates is invalid, but the cells themselves are not part of the grid.

So the snake is 13 segments long. Head direction is down, which is D. Since direction is D, moving down means increasing y? I need to clarify coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, (x,y) with y increasing upwards or downwards? The movement says U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increases upwards, but in many games, y increases downwards. Let's see the movement definitions:\n> \n> - U: (x,y+1) – if y+1, that means y increases as we go up? But in the context, let's see the snake positions.\n> \n> Snake head is at (6,3), and direction is D, which is down. D is (x,y-1) according to the movement constraints.

So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's list possible coordinates.\n> \n> x=0 to x=7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive. Similarly, y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6 inclusive.

Similarly, (5,6) life span 10, disappears at turn 71.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,3) with direction down.

Snake body: positions are [(6,3), (6,4), (5,4), ...] so (6,4) is the second segment, which is the body. So if head moves to (6,4), it would collide with the body segment there.\n> \n> Body collision: head touches any body segment. But note the exception: can move into tail cell because tail moves away.\n> \n> Here, (6,4) is not the tail; tail is at (6,1), I think.

So tail is (6,1).\n> \n> (6,4) is the segment right after head, so if head moves to (6,4), it would be on top of the current position of the first body segment. Since the body moves, after head moves, the body segments follow, so if head goes to (6,4), the body segment that was at (6,4) will move to where the head was? Let's think how snake movement works.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So if head moves to a new cell, the segment that was behind the head moves to the head's old position, and so on.\n> \n> So if head is at S0, body at S1, S2, ..., Stail.\n> \n> After move, head to new position, S1 moves to S0, S2 to S1, etc., Stail moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> Therefore, if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by S1 (the first body segment), then after the move, S1 moves to S0, so the head is at the new cell, but S1 is no longer there; it moved away. However, during the move, if head goes to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail under certain conditions, it collides.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, for a body segment that is not the tail, if head moves to it, it will cause collision because at the time of move, that cell is occupied and not by the tail.\n> \n> In this case, (6,4) is currently occupied by the first body segment, which is not the tail (tail is at (6,1)), so moving to (6,4) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (5,3): is (5,3) occupied? Look at positions: (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So (5,3) is not in the list, so it should be free, but need to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,3) is x=5,y=3, which is within 1-6, so not wall. Obstacles: internal obstacle at (3,2), not (5,3). So (5,3) should be free.\n> \n> Moving D to (6,2): (6,2) not in snake positions, and not wall or obstacle. y=2, x=6, within bounds.\n> \n> Moving R to (7,3) but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Also, cannot move U because opposite to current direction D.\n> \n> So possible moves:\n> \n> - L: to (5,3) – left\n> \n> - D: to (6,2) – down\n> \n> U is not possible because opposite and also occupied.\n> \n> R is wall.\n> \n> So only L or D.\n> \n> Now, food is at (5,5) and (5,6).\n> \n> (5,5) is at x=5,y=5, and (5,6) at x=5,y=6.\n> \n> But y=6 is the top row? y=7 is wall, so y=6 is within bounds, since y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Grid: y=1 bottom? Since D is y-1, so y decreases down, so y=1 is bottom, y=6 is top? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Movement: U: (x,y+1) so y increases as we go up. D: (x,y-1) so y decreases as we go down.\n> \n> So at (6,3), U to (6,4), D to (6,2).\n> \n> y=1 is the bottom row, y=6 is the top row.\n> \n> Food at (5,5) and (5,6): (5,6) is at y=6, which is the top row, since y=7 is wall.\n> \n> (5,6) is within grid.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> Current turn t1=61.\n> \n> Sequence for turn 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, and so on, but at least 5 turns.\n> \n> Also, think long-term.\n> \n> First, from (6,3), I can go left to (5,3) or down to (6,2).\n> \n> If I go down to (6,2), that is closer to the bottom, but food is up at (5,5) and (5,6).\n> \n> (6,2) to (5,5) is not direct.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid 6x6: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: borders, and obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head (6,3), body: (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n> \n> So the snake is mostly on the right and bottom, with a part going left to (2,4) then down to (2,1) and right to (6,1).\n> \n> Specifically, from head (6,3), it goes up to (6,4), then left to (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), then down to (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), then right to (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1).\n> \n> Tail is at (6,1).\n> \n> Food at (5,5) and (5,6).\n> \n> (5,5) is at row 5, col 5, and (5,6) at row 5, col 6? x=5,y=5 and x=5,y=6.\n> \n> In coordinates, (x,y), so (5,5) is x=5,y=5, (5,6) is x=5,y=6.\n> \n> y=6 is top row.\n> \n> Now, (5,5) is empty?

Let's calculate.\n> \n> At turn t, food has life span L, it will disappear after L turns, so at turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, at turn 61, life span 7, so it exists on turns 61,62,63,64,65,66,67, disappears at turn 68. So can be eaten from turn 61 to 67 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6) life 10, exists from 61 to 70, disappears at 71.\n> \n> Now, I need to get to the food, but also avoid risks.\n> \n> First, from (6,3), options:\n> \n> - Move L to (5,3)\n> \n> - Move D to (6,2)\n> \n> If I move D to (6,2), then head at (6,2), direction D.\n> \n> Then from there, I can move L to (5,2), or D to (6,1), but (6,1) is the tail.\n> \n> (6,1) is tail, so moving to (6,1) might be possible since it's the tail.\n> \n> Rule: can move into tail cell because tail moves away.\n> \n> But in this case, if head moves to (6,1), which is tail, then after move, head is at (6,1), tail moves to (5,1)? Positions: current positions: head (6,3), then (6,4), (5,4), ..., (5,1), (6,1) tail.\n> \n> If head moves D to (6,2), then new head at (6,2), the segment that was at (6,4) moves to (6,3)?

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State (Turn \\( t_0 = 63 \\))\n\nFirst, let's parse the current state:\n\n- **Grid Dimensions**: The playable area is from \\( x=1 \\) to \\( x=6 \\) and \\( y=1 \\) to \\( y=6 \\). Walls are at \\( x=0, x=7 \\) and \\( y=0, y=7 \\). There's also an internal obstacle at \\( (3, 2) \\).\n  \n- **Snake Positions**: The snake's head is at \\( (4, 3) \\), followed by body segments in this order:\n  - Head: \\( (4, 3) \\)\n  - Body: \\( (5, 3) \\), \\( (6, 3) \\), \\( (6, 4) \\), \\( (5, 4) \\), \\( (4, 4) \\), \\( (3, 4) \\), \\( (2, 4) \\), \\( (2, 3) \\), \\( (2, 2) \\), \\( (2, 1) \\), \\( (3, 1) \\), \\( (4, 1) \\)\n  - Tail: \\( (5, 1) \\) (assuming the last segment is the tail)\n\n- **Snake Head Direction**: The head is currently moving left (`L`), meaning the previous move was to the left (from \\( (5, 3) \\) to \\( (4, 3) \\)).\n\n- **Food**:\n  - \\( (5, 5) \\): Value = +1, Life Span = 5 (will disappear at turn 68)\n  - \\( (5, 6) \\): Value = +1, Life Span = 8 (will disappear at turn 71)\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 63\n\nFrom the current head position \\( (4, 3) \\) with direction `L`, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (`U`)**: \\( (4, 4) \\)\n   - Check if \\( (4, 4) \\) is occupied: Yes, it's part of the snake's body.\n   - Cannot move here as it would cause a collision.\n\n2. **Down (`D`)**: \\( (4, 2) \\)\n   - Check if \\( (4, 2) \\) is occupied or a wall/obstacle:\n     - Not in snake positions.\n     - Not a wall (\\( x=4, y=2 \\) is within bounds).\n     - Not the obstacle at \\( (3, 2) \\).\n   - Valid move.\n\n3. **Left (`L`)**: \\( (3, 3) \\)\n   - Check if \\( (3, 3) \\) is occupied or a wall/obstacle:\n     - Not in snake positions.\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not the obstacle at \\( (3, 2) \\).\n   - Valid move.\n\n4. **Right (`R`)**: \\( (5, 3) \\)\n   - Check if \\( (5, 3) \\) is occupied:\n     - It's the segment right after the head (the first body segment).\n     - Normally, moving into the first body segment is a collision, but there's an exception if it's the tail.\n     - Here, the tail is at \\( (5, 1) \\), so \\( (5, 3) \\) is not the tail.\n   - Cannot move here as it would cause a collision.\n\nAdditionally, we cannot reverse the direction immediately. The current direction is `L`, so we cannot move `R` (right) next. However, `R` is already invalid due to collision, so this doesn't add a new constraint.\n\n### Valid Moves:\n- Down (`D`) to \\( (4, 2) \\)\n- Left (`L`) to \\( (3, 3) \\)\n\n### Evaluating the Moves\n\n**Option 1: Move Down (`D`) to \\( (4, 2) \\)**\n- New head position: \\( (4, 2) \\)\n- The body segment at \\( (5, 3) \\) will move to \\( (4, 3) \\), and so on.\n- Next possible moves from \\( (4, 2) \\):\n  - Up (`U`) to \\( (4, 3) \\): Occupied by the body segment that just moved there.\n  - Down (`D`) to \\( (4, 1) \\): Occupied by the snake's body (segment at \\( (4, 1) \\)).\n  - Left (`L`) to \\( (3, 2) \\): Obstacle at \\( (3, 2) \\).\n  - Right (`R`) to \\( (5, 2) \\): Need to check if \\( (5, 2) \\) is free.\n    - \\( (5, 2) \\) is not in the snake's current positions, not a wall, not an obstacle.\n    - Valid move.\n  \nFrom \\( (4, 2) \\), the only valid move would be `R` to \\( (5, 2) \\), which seems safe but doesn't directly lead toward the food.\n\n**Option 2: Move Left (`L`) to \\( (3, 3) \\)**\n- New head position: \\( (3, 3) \\)\n- The body segment at \\( (5, 3) \\) moves to \\( (4, 3) \\), and so on.\n- Next possible moves from \\( (3, 3) \\):\n  - Up (`U`) to \\( (3, 4) \\): Occupied by the snake's body (segment at \\( (3, 4) \\)).\n  - Down (`D`) to \\( (3, 2) \\): Obstacle at \\( (3, 2) \\).\n  - Left (`L`) to \\( (2, 3) \\): Occupied by the snake's body (segment at \\( (2, 3) \\)).\n  - Right (`R`) to \\( (4, 3) \\): Occupied by the body segment that just moved there.\n  \nFrom \\( (3, 3) \\), there are no valid moves, leading to a dead end. This is dangerous as it would trap the snake.\n\n### Considering the Previous Plan\n\nFrom the previous thinking model at turn \\( t_1 = 61 \\), the planned sequence was:\n- Turn 61: L\n- Turn 62: D\n- Turn 63: R\n- Turn 64: D\n- Turn 65: L\n\nAt turn 63, the planned move is `R`. However, as we saw, moving `R` to \\( (5, 3) \\) is invalid because it's occupied by the first body segment (not the tail). Therefore, we cannot follow this plan at turn 63.\n\n### Re-evaluating Based on Current Constraints\n\nGiven that the planned `R` move is invalid, we must choose between `D` and `L`:\n- `D` to \\( (4, 2) \\) is safe and allows future movement to \\( (5, 2) \\).\n- `L` to \\( (3, 3) \\) leads to a dead end.\n\nTherefore, the safer choice is to move `D` to \\( (4, 2) \\), even though it doesn't directly advance toward the food. This avoids immediate danger and keeps options open for future moves.\n\n### Checking for Food Accessibility\n\nThe food at \\( (5, 5) \\) and \\( (5, 6) \\) is to the right and up from the current position. Moving `D` to \\( (4, 2) \\) takes us further down, but we can potentially loop around:\n- After \\( (4, 2) \\), move `R` to \\( (5, 2) \\).\n- Then `U` to \\( (5, 3) \\), etc., to approach the food.\n\nHowever, given the snake's length and the grid's size, reaching the food in time may be challenging, especially for \\( (5, 5) \\) which disappears at turn 68 (current turn is 63). \n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the constraints and to avoid immediate danger, the best immediate action is to move down (`D`). This keeps the snake safe and allows for future maneuvering.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

That means the grid is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? Let me confirm. Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> - Snake positions: Head is at (6,3), and the body segments follow: [(6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)]. So the snake is 13 segments long. Head direction is down, which is D. Since direction is D, moving down means increasing y? I need to clarify coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, (x,y) with y increasing upwards or downwards? The movement says U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increases upwards, but in many games, y increases downwards. Let's see the movement definitions:\n> \n> - U: (x,y+1) – if y+1, that means y increases as we go up? But in the context, let's see the snake positions.\n> \n> Snake head is at (6,3), and direction is D, which is down. D is (x,y-1) according to the movement constraints. So:\n> \n> - U: (x, y+1) – up\n> \n> - D: (x, y-1) – down\n> \n> - L: (x-1, y) – left\n> \n> - R: (x+1, y) – right\n> \n> Also, walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's list possible coordinates.\n> \n> x=0 to x=7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive. Similarly, y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6 inclusive. So grid is 6x6 cells: x=1,2,3,4,5,6 and y=1,2,3,4,5,6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), which is within the grid.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (5,5) with life span 7, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (5,6) with life span 10, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive food, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for both, and life span given.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 61, for (5,5) life span 7, meaning it will disappear after 7 more turns, so at turn 68. Similarly, (5,6) life span 10, disappears at turn 71.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,3) with direction down. Down is (x,y-1), so from (6,3), moving down would go to (6,2).\n> \n> But let's see where the snake can move.\n> \n> Current head position: (6,3)\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (x,y+1) = (6,4)\n> \n> - D: (x,y-1) = (6,2)\n> \n> - L: (x-1,y) = (5,3)\n> \n> - R: (x+1,y) = (7,3) but x=7 is wall, so not possible.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: current direction is D, so cannot move U immediately, because U is opposite to D? Let's see.\n> \n> Current direction is down (D). Opposite would be up (U). So cannot move U on next turn.\n> \n> Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> So from D, cannot move U.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid collisions.\n> \n> First, list possible moves from (6,3):\n> \n> - U: (6,4) – but is this occupied? Snake body: positions are [(6,3), (6,4), (5,4), ...] so (6,4) is the second segment, which is the body. So if head moves to (6,4), it would collide with the body segment there.\n> \n> Body collision: head touches any body segment. But note the exception: can move into tail cell because tail moves away.\n> \n> Here, (6,4) is not the tail; tail is at (6,1), I think. Snake positions: head (6,3), then (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So tail is (6,1).\n> \n> (6,4) is the segment right after head, so if head moves to (6,4), it would be on top of the current position of the first body segment. Since the body moves, after head moves, the body segments follow, so if head goes to (6,4), the body segment that was at (6,4) will move to where the head was? Let's think how snake movement works.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So if head moves to a new cell, the segment that was behind the head moves to the head's old position, and so on.\n> \n> So if head is at S0, body at S1, S2, ..., Stail.\n> \n> After move, head to new position, S1 moves to S0, S2 to S1, etc., Stail moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> Therefore, if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by S1 (the first body segment), then after the move, S1 moves to S0, so the head is at the new cell, but S1 is no longer there; it moved away. However, during the move, if head goes to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail under certain conditions, it collides.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, for a body segment that is not the tail, if head moves to it, it will cause collision because at the time of move, that cell is occupied and not by the tail.\n> \n> In this case, (6,4) is currently occupied by the first body segment, which is not the tail (tail is at (6,1)), so moving to (6,4) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (5,3): is (5,3) occupied? Look at positions: (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So (5,3) is not in the list, so it should be free, but need to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,3) is x=5,y=3, which is within 1-6, so not wall. Obstacles: internal obstacle at (3,2), not (5,3).

tail is at (6,1), so it will take time.\n> \n> The segment at (5,4) will move to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> After each move, the body moves, so the cell (5,4) will be occupied by different segments, but it may be vacated when the tail moves past.\n> \n> But the tail is at (6,1), and the body is long, so (5,4) will be occupied for a while.\n> \n> For example, the distance from head to (5,4) is 2 segments, so when the head moves, (5,4) will be occupied by the next segment.\n> \n> It will only be free when the tail moves away, but the tail is far.\n> \n> So to free (5,4), I

According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> So (2,3) has food under it, but it's currently covered by the snake body segment. To eat it, that segment must move away, and then the head must move to (2,3).\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (5,5) and (5,6) are not occupied, I think.\n> \n> (5,5): let's see if it's occupied. Snake positions: (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1). None of these are (5,5), so (5,5) is free. Similarly, (5,6) is free. (2,3) is occupied by body segment at index 9.\n> \n> Now, head direction is down, so from (4,2), moving down would be to (4,1), but let's see what's at (4,1).\n> \n> y=1, x=4. Is (4,1) occupied? Snake positions: (2,1) and (3,1), but not (4,1). Also, walls: y=0 is bottom, so (4,1) should be free, but y=0 is wall, y=1 is not wall? Borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells with y=0 or y=7 are invalid. Similarly x=0 or x=7.\n> \n> So (4,1) is within bounds: x=4 (1 to 6? x=0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x: 1 to 6? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Cells: x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so snake cannot be there. Similarly y=0 and y=7 walls.\n> \n> In the snake positions, we have (2,1), (3,1), which are y=1, x=2 and x=3. y=1 is not wall, since wall is y=0.\n> \n> y=0 is wall, so (x,0) for any x is wall, similarly (x,7), (0,y), (7,y) are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> So for (4,1): x=4, y=1. x=4 is between 1 and 6, y=1 is not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Is it obstacle? Only (3,2) is obstacle, so (4,1) should be free.\n> \n> But snake body: we have (2,1) and (3,1), but not (4,1), so (4,1) is empty.\n> \n> Head at (4,2), direction down, so moving down to (4,1) is possible? Direction down means decreasing y, since y=0 is bottom? Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if U increases y, that might imply y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Let's see.\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) — so moving up increases y.\n> \n> D: (x,y-1) — moving down decreases y.\n> \n> So y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row? No: if y increases up, then y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. For example, from (4,2), D down to (4,1) which is lower y, so bottom.\n> \n> Similarly, L: (x-1,y) left, R: (x+1,y) right.\n> \n> x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> Walls at borders.\n> \n> Now, from head (4,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - Down (D): to (4,1) — as above, should be free.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (3,2)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (5,2)\n> \n> Cannot move up (U) because that would be opposite to current direction? Current direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up). Rule: no instant reverse, so cannot move opposite on next turn. So since current direction is D, I cannot move U to (4,3).\n> \n> (4,3) is also occupied by the body, so definitely cannot move there.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,2) with direction D:\n> \n> - D to (4,1)\n> \n> - L to (3,2)\n> \n> - R to (5,2)\n> \n> Now, check each:\n> \n> (4,1): as above, not wall, not obstacle, not occupied by snake? Snake has (2,1) and (3,1), not (4,1), so free.\n> \n> (3,2): x=3,y=2. Internal obstacle at (3,2), so it's a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> (5,2): x=5,y=2. Not border, not obstacle (obstacle is (3,2)), not in snake positions? Snake: (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), etc., no (5,2), so free.\n> \n> So possible moves: D to (4,1) or R to (5,2). L to (3,2) is blocked by obstacle.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, food: (5,5) life span 4, (5,6) life span 7, (2,3) life span 10.\n> \n> (2,3) is currently occupied by body, so to eat it, the body must move away first.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current turn t=64.\n> \n> So for food at (5,5), life span 4, meaning it will disappear after 4 turns, so at turn 68 it will be gone? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Example: at turn t, life span L, after this turn, life span becomes L-1, and so on, until life span 0, then disappears before the next turn? The rule says: disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, food has life span L. After the turn, if not eaten, life span decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> So for (5,5): life span 4 at turn 64. After turn 64, if not eaten, life span 3 at turn 65. After turn 65, if not eaten, life span 2 at turn 66. After turn 66, if not eaten, life span 1 at turn 67. After turn 67, if not eaten, life span 0, disappears before turn 68. So it can be eaten on turns 64,65,66,67. Last chance turn 67.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6): life span 7 at turn 64, so can be eaten until turn 70 (since 64+7-1=70? After turn 64, span 6; ... after turn 70, span 0, disappear before 71. So last chance turn 70.\n> \n> (2,3): life span 10, last chance turn 73.\n> \n> But (2,3) is occupied now, so we need to free it first.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (4,2), direction down.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of moves for several turns.\n> \n> First, let's think about immediate moves.\n> \n> If I move down to (4,1), what happens? (4,1) is free, so snake moves: head to (4,1), then body segments follow. The tail is at (3,1), which will move away from its position.\n> \n> Current tail is (3,1), since positions: head (4,2), then body, tail is (3,1).\n> \n> After move D to (4,1): new head at (4,1), then the body: the segment that was at (4,2) moves to where head was? Snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So after moving head to (4,1), the new positions: head (4,1), then the first body segment was (4,3)? Let's list:\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (4,2) head\n> \n> 1: (4,3)\n> \n> 2: (5,3)\n> \n> 3: (6,3)\n> \n> 4: (6,4)\n> \n> 5: (5,4)\n> \n> 6: (4,4)\n> \n> 7: (3,4)\n> \n> 8: (2,4)\n> \n> 9: (2,3)\n> \n> 10: (2,2)\n> \n> 11: (2,1)\n> \n> 12: (3,1) tail\n> \n> After moving head down to (4,1):\n> \n> New head: (4,1)\n> \n> Then body: segment that was index 0 moves to (4,1), but index 1 moves to where index 0 was, which is (4,2)? Standard snake: the head moves to new position, and each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous one in the list.\n> \n> So new position 0: (4,1)  // new head\n> \n> Position 1: old position 0, which is (4,2)\n> \n> Position 2: old position 1, which is (4,3)\n> \n> Position 3: old position 2, which is (5,3)\n> \n> Position 4: old position 3, (6,3)\n> \n> Position 5: old position 4, (6,4)\n> \n> Position 6: old position 5, (5,4)\n> \n> Position 7: old position 6, (4,4)\n> \n> Position 8: old position 7, (3,4)\n> \n> Position 9: old position 8, (2,4)\n> \n> Position 10: old position 9, (2,3)\n> \n> Position 11: old position 10, (2,2)\n> \n> Position 12: old position 11, (2,1)  // and the tail old position 12 is left, so it disappears, but since no food eaten, length same, tail moves away.\n> \n> Old tail was (3,1), which is now vacated.\n> \n> Now, (2,3) was occupied by segment 9, now it moves to old position 8, which is (2,4)? Old position 9 was (2,3), now it becomes position 10 at (2,3)? After move: position 10 is old position 9, which was (2,3), so (2,3) is still occupied by position 10 now.\n> \n> Let's clarify:\n> \n> New positions after move D:\n> \n> - Head: (4,1)\n> \n> - Then: (4,2)  // was head\n> \n> - Then: (4,3)  // was pos1\n> \n> - Then: (5,3)  // was pos2\n> \n> - Then: (6,3)  // was pos3\n> \n> - Then: (6,4)  // was pos4\n> \n> - Then: (5,4)  // was pos5\n> \n> - Then: (4,4)  // was pos6\n> \n> - Then: (3,4)  // was pos7\n> \n> - Then: (2,4)  // was pos8\n> \n> - Then: (2,3)  // was pos9, still at (2,3)\n> \n> - Then: (2,2)  // was pos10\n> \n> - Then: (2,1)  // was pos11, and tail\n> \n> The last segment was (3,1), which is now gone, and (2,1) is now the tail.\n> \n> So (2,3) is still occupied by the body segment that was at index 9, now at index 10.\n> \n> To eat the food at (2,3), we need the body to move away from it, meaning that segment leaves (2,3), and then later the head moves to (2,3).\n> \n> Currently, it's occupied, so we can't eat it immediately.\n> \n> If I move right to (5,2) instead.\n> \n> From (4,2) move R to (5,2).\n> \n> New head: (5,2)\n> \n> Then body: (4,2) // old head\n> \n> (4,3) // old pos1\n> \n> (5,3) // old pos2\n> \n> (6,3) // old pos3\n> \n> (6,4) // old pos4\n> \n> (5,4) // old pos5\n> \n> (4,4) // old pos6\n> \n> (3,4) // old pos7\n> \n> (2,4) // old pos8\n> \n> (2,3) // old pos9, still at (2,3)\n> \n> (2,2) // old pos10\n> \n> (2,1) // old pos11\n> \n> (3,1) // old pos12, tail, now at (2,1)? Position 11 is old pos10 (2,2), position 12 is old pos11 (2,1), and tail was (3,1) gone.\n> \n> (2,3) still occupied.\n> \n> So in both cases, moving to (4,1) or (5,2) doesn't free (2,3) immediately; it remains occupied.\n> \n> To free (2,3), we need the segment on it to move, which is part of the body.\n> \n> The segment at (2,3) is currently index 9, and it will move when the snake moves, but it moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> For example, when the snake moves, the segment at (2,3) will move to where the segment ahead of it was.\n> \n> Currently, the segment ahead of (2,3) is (2,4) at index 8.\n> \n> So when snake moves, if the head moves somewhere, the segment at (2,4) might move, and then (2,3) will move to (2,4)'s old position.\n> \n> Let's see the positions around (2,3).\n> \n> The snake has: (2,4) above, (2,3) itself, (2,2) below, and (2,1) below that.

Better to think that after a move, the cell previously occupied by a body segment might be free if that segment moved and no other segment took its place.\n> \n> Specifically for (2,3), it is currently occupied by position 9.\n> \n> After a move, position 9 will be at the old position of position 8.\n> \n> Position 8 is at (2,4).\n> \n> So if position 8 moves to a new position, then position 9 will move to (2,4), so the cell (2,3) is left empty, unless the tail or something was there, but tail is at (3,1).\n> \n> After the move, (2,3) is free, because position 9 moves to where position 8 was, which is (2,4), so (2,3) is vacated.\n> \n> Similarly, in the earlier example, when I moved D to (4,1), the new position 10 was at (2,3), which was old position 9, so (2,3) is still occupied.\n> \n> After any move where no food is eaten, the tail position is vacated, but (2,3) is not the tail; it's a body segment.\n> \n> The cell (2,3) will be vacated only if the segment that was there moves and no new segment moves to it. But when the snake moves, the segment at (2,3) moves to (2,4), so (2,3) is left empty, and (2,4) is now occupied by that segment.\n> \n> Let's take a smaller example.\n> \n> Suppose snake positions: head at A, then B, then C at (2,3).\n> \n> After move, head moves to new position, say A to A', then B moves to A, C moves to B.\n> \n> So if C was at (2,3), and B was at P, then C moves to P, so (2,3) is no longer occupied by C, and if no other segment was at (2,3), it is free.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,3), it is occupied by C, which moves to where B was, so (2,3) is free after the move.\n> \n> Similarly in our case, after any move, the cell that was occupied by the segment that moved from it is free, unless the new position of another segment is there, but since segments move to specific positions, it should be free.\n> \n> In the move to (4,1), before move, (2,3) occupied by pos9.\n> \n> After move, pos9 is now at old position of pos8, which is (2,4), so the cell (2,3) is no longer occupied by pos9; it is now occupied by nothing, so free, unless another segment moved to it, but in the new positions, the only segments are at new locations: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), etc., and (2,4) is now occupied by pos9, but (2,3) is not in the new positions, so it should be free.\n> \n> Let's list new positions again:\n> \n> After move D to (4,1):\n> \n> - (4,1) - head\n> \n> - (4,2) - was head\n> \n> - (4,3) - was pos1\n> \n> - (5,3) - was pos2\n> \n> - (6,3) - was pos3\n> \n> - (6,4) - was pos4\n> \n> - (5,4) - was pos5\n> \n> - (4,4) - was pos6\n> \n> - (3,4) - was pos7\n> \n> - (2,4) - was pos8\n> \n> - (2,3) - was pos9, now at (2,4)?

Snake positions: (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1). None of these are (5,5), so (5,5) is free. Similarly, (5,6) is free.

Snake positions: (2,1) and (3,1), but not (4,1). Also, walls: y=0 is bottom, so (4,1) should be free, but y=0 is wall, y=1 is not wall? Borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells with y=0 or y=7 are invalid. Similarly x=0 or x=7.\n> \n> So (4,1) is within bounds: x=4 (1 to 6? x=0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x: 1 to 6? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Cells: x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so snake cannot be there. Similarly y=0 and y=7 walls.\n> \n> In the snake positions, we have (2,1), (3,1), which are y=1, x=2 and x=3. y=1 is not wall, since wall is y=0.\n> \n> y=0 is wall, so (x,0) for any x is wall, similarly (x,7), (0,y), (7,y) are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> So for (4,1): x=4, y=1. x=4 is between 1 and 6, y=1 is not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Is it obstacle? Only (3,2) is obstacle, so (4,1) should be free.\n> \n> But snake body: we have (2,1) and (3,1), but not (4,1), so (4,1) is empty.\n> \n> Head at (4,2), direction down, so moving down to (4,1) is possible? Direction down means decreasing y, since y=0 is bottom? Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if U increases y, that might imply y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Let's see.\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) — so moving up increases y.\n> \n> D: (x,y-1) — moving down decreases y.\n> \n> So y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row? No: if y increases up, then y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. For example, from (4,2), D down to (4,1) which is lower y, so bottom.\n> \n> Similarly, L: (x-1,y) left, R: (x+1,y) right.\n> \n> x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> Walls at borders.\n> \n> Now, from head (4,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - Down (D): to (4,1) — as above, should be free.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (3,2)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (5,2)\n> \n> Cannot move up (U) because that would be opposite to current direction? Current direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up). Rule: no instant reverse, so cannot move opposite on next turn. So since current direction is D, I cannot move U to (4,3).\n> \n> (4,3) is also occupied by the body, so definitely cannot move there.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,2) with direction D:\n> \n> - D to (4,1)\n> \n> - L to (3,2)\n> \n> - R to (5,2)\n> \n> Now, check each:\n> \n> (4,1): as above, not wall, not obstacle, not occupied by snake? Snake has (2,1) and (3,1), not (4,1), so free.\n> \n> (3,2): x=3,y=2. Internal obstacle at (3,2), so it's a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> (5,2): x=5,y=2. Not border, not obstacle (obstacle is (3,2)), not in snake positions? Snake: (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), etc., no (5,2), so free.\n> \n> So possible moves: D to (4,1) or R to (5,2). L to (3,2) is blocked by obstacle.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, food: (5,5) life span 4, (5,6) life span 7, (2,3) life span 10.\n> \n> (2,3) is currently occupied by body, so to eat it, the body must move away first.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current turn t=64.\n> \n> So for food at (5,5), life span 4, meaning it will disappear after 4 turns, so at turn 68 it will be gone? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Example: at turn t, life span L, after this turn, life span becomes L-1, and so on, until life span 0, then disappears before the next turn? The rule says: disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, food has life span L. After the turn, if not eaten, life span decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> So for (5,5): life span 4 at turn 64. After turn 64, if not eaten, life span 3 at turn 65. After turn 65, if not eaten, life span 2 at turn 66. After turn 66, if not eaten, life span 1 at turn 67. After turn 67, if not eaten, life span 0, disappears before turn 68. So it can be eaten on turns 64,65,66,67. Last chance turn 67.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6): life span 7 at turn 64, so can be eaten until turn 70 (since 64+7-1=70? After turn 64, span 6; ... after turn 70, span 0, disappear before 71. So last chance turn 70.\n> \n> (2,3): life span 10, last chance turn 73.\n> \n> But (2,3) is occupied now, so we need to free it first.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (4,2), direction down.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of moves for several turns.\n> \n> First, let's think about immediate moves.\n> \n> If I move down to (4,1), what happens? (4,1) is free, so snake moves: head to (4,1), then body segments follow. The tail is at (3,1), which will move away from its position.\n> \n> Current tail is (3,1), since positions: head (4,2), then body, tail is (3,1).\n> \n> After move D to (4,1): new head at (4,1), then the body: the segment that was at (4,2) moves to where head was? Snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So after moving head to (4,1), the new positions: head (4,1), then the first body segment was (4,3)? Let's list:\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (4,2) head\n> \n> 1: (4,3)\n> \n> 2: (5,3)\n> \n> 3: (6,3)\n> \n> 4: (6,4)\n> \n> 5: (5,4)\n> \n> 6: (4,4)\n> \n> 7: (3,4)\n> \n> 8: (2,4)\n> \n> 9: (2,3)\n> \n> 10: (2,2)\n> \n> 11: (2,1)\n> \n> 12: (3,1) tail\n> \n> After moving head down to (4,1):\n> \n> New head: (4,1)\n> \n> Then body: segment that was index 0 moves to (4,1), but index 1 moves to where index 0 was, which is (4,2)?

Better to think that after a move, the cell previously occupied by a body segment might be free if that segment moved and no other segment took its place.\n> \n> Specifically for (2,3), it is currently occupied by position 9.\n> \n> After a move, position 9 will be at the old position of position 8.\n> \n> Position 8 is at (2,4).\n> \n> So if position 8 moves to a new position, then position 9 will move to (2,4), so the cell (2,3) is left empty, unless the tail or something was there, but tail is at (3,1).\n> \n> After the move, (2,3) is free, because position 9 moves to where position 8 was, which is (2,4), so (2,3) is vacated.\n> \n> Similarly, in the earlier example, when I moved D to (4,1), the new position 10 was at (2,3), which was old position 9, so (2,3) is still occupied.\n> \n> After any move where no food is eaten, the tail position is vacated, but (2,3) is not the tail; it's a body segment.\n> \n> The cell (2,3) will be vacated only if the segment that was there moves and no new segment moves to it. But when the snake moves, the segment at (2,3) moves to (2,4), so (2,3) is left empty, and (2,4) is now occupied by that segment.\n> \n> Let's take a smaller example.\n> \n> Suppose snake positions: head at A, then B, then C at (2,3).\n> \n> After move, head moves to new position, say A to A', then B moves to A, C moves to B.\n> \n> So if C was at (2,3), and B was at P, then C moves to P, so (2,3) is no longer occupied by C, and if no other segment was at (2,3), it is free.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,3), it is occupied by C, which moves to where B was, so (2,3) is free after the move.\n> \n> Similarly in our case, after any move, the cell that was occupied by the segment that moved from it is free, unless the new position of another segment is there, but since segments move to specific positions, it should be free.\n> \n> In the move to (4,1), before move, (2,3) occupied by pos9.\n> \n> After move, pos9 is now at old position of pos8, which is (2,4), so the cell (2,3) is no longer occupied by pos9; it is now occupied by nothing, so free, unless another segment moved to it, but in the new positions, the only segments are at new locations: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), etc., and (2,4) is now occupied by pos9, but (2,3) is not in the new positions, so it should be free.\n> \n> Let's list new positions again:\n> \n> After move D to (4,1):\n> \n> - (4,1) - head\n> \n> - (4,2) - was head\n> \n> - (4,3) - was pos1\n> \n> - (5,3) - was pos2\n> \n> - (6,3) - was pos3\n> \n> - (6,4) - was pos4\n> \n> - (5,4) - was pos5\n> \n> - (4,4) - was pos6\n> \n> - (3,4) - was pos7\n> \n> - (2,4) - was pos8\n> \n> - (2,3) - was pos9, now at (2,4)? No: new position for index 10 is old position 9, which is (2,3), so (2,3) is occupied by index 10.\n> \n> I think I have indexing confusion.\n> \n> Define the positions after move.\n> \n> The new snake positions are:\n> \n> - New head: (4,1)\n> \n> - New position 1: old position 0, which is (4,2)\n> \n> - New position 2: old position 1, which is (4,3)\n> \n> - New position 3: old position 2, which is (5,3)\n> \n> - New position 4: old position 3, which is (6,3)\n> \n> - New position 5: old position 4, which is (6,4)\n> \n> - New position 6: old position 5, which is (5,4)\n> \n> - New position 7: old position 6, which is (4,4)\n> \n> - New position 8: old position 7, which is (3,4)\n> \n> - New position 9: old position 8, which is (2,4)\n> \n> - New position 10: old position 9, which is (2,3)  // so (2,3) is still occupied, now by position 10\n> \n> - New position 11: old position 10, which is (2,2)\n> \n> - New position 12: old position 11, which is (2,1)  // and old position 12 (3,1) is gone\n> \n> So (2,3) is still occupied by the body, now at index 10.\n> \n> It never gets freed because the segment on it just moves to the next position in line.\n> \n> To free (2,3), we need the segment that is on it to move away, and no other segment to move into it, but because the snake is connected, when the snake moves, the segment on (2,3) will move to where the previous segment was, so (2,3) is only freed if that segment was the tail and it moves, but here it's not the tail.\n> \n> The tail is at (3,1), which does get freed when it moves.\n> \n> For (2,3), it is always occupied as long as the snake is there, because it's a body segment that moves along.\n> \n> The only way to free a body cell is if the snake shortens or changes shape, but without eating, the length is constant, so the cells remain occupied.\n> \n> But the rules say: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for the body to move away, that means when the snake moves, the segment that was on that cell leaves, and since no new segment comes (because it's not the head position), the cell is free for that moment.\n> \n> In the case of (2,3), when the snake moves, the segment that was at (2,3) moves to a new cell, so (2,3) is empty after the move, until something else happens.\n> \n> But in the new positions, no segment is at (2,3), so it should be free.\n> \n> In the example above, after move, the new positions do not include (2,3) as occupied; it is occupied by new position 10, which is at (2,3)?

For example, from (4,2), D down to (4,1) which is lower y, so bottom.\n> \n> Similarly, L: (x-1,y) left, R: (x+1,y) right.\n> \n> x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> Walls at borders.\n> \n> Now, from head (4,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - Down (D): to (4,1) — as above, should be free.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (3,2)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (5,2)\n> \n> Cannot move up (U) because that would be opposite to current direction? Current direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up). Rule: no instant reverse, so cannot move opposite on next turn. So since current direction is D, I cannot move U to (4,3).\n> \n> (4,3) is also occupied by the body, so definitely cannot move there.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,2) with direction D:\n> \n> - D to (4,1)\n> \n> - L to (3,2)\n> \n> - R to (5,2)\n> \n> Now, check each:\n> \n> (4,1): as above, not wall, not obstacle, not occupied by snake? Snake has (2,1) and (3,1), not (4,1), so free.\n> \n> (3,2): x=3,y=2. Internal obstacle at (3,2), so it's a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> (5,2): x=5,y=2. Not border, not obstacle (obstacle is (3,2)), not in snake positions? Snake: (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), etc., no (5,2), so free.\n> \n> So possible moves: D to (4,1) or R to (5,2). L to (3,2) is blocked by obstacle.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, food: (5,5) life span 4, (5,6) life span 7, (2,3) life span 10.\n> \n> (2,3) is currently occupied by body, so to eat it, the body must move away first.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current turn t=64.\n> \n> So for food at (5,5), life span 4, meaning it will disappear after 4 turns, so at turn 68 it will be gone? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Example: at turn t, life span L, after this turn, life span becomes L-1, and so on, until life span 0, then disappears before the next turn? The rule says: disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, food has life span L. After the turn, if not eaten, life span decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> So for (5,5): life span 4 at turn 64. After turn 64, if not eaten, life span 3 at turn 65. After turn 65, if not eaten, life span 2 at turn 66. After turn 66, if not eaten, life span 1 at turn 67. After turn 67, if not eaten, life span 0, disappears before turn 68. So it can be eaten on turns 64,65,66,67. Last chance turn 67.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6): life span 7 at turn 64, so can be eaten until turn 70 (since 64+7-1=70? After turn 64, span 6; ... after turn 70, span 0, disappear before 71. So last chance turn 70.\n> \n> (2,3): life span 10, last chance turn 73.\n> \n> But (2,3) is occupied now, so we need to free it first.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (4,2), direction down.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of moves for several turns.\n> \n> First, let's think about immediate moves.\n> \n> If I move down to (4,1), what happens? (4,1) is free, so snake moves: head to (4,1), then body segments follow. The tail is at (3,1), which will move away from its position.\n> \n> Current tail is (3,1), since positions: head (4,2), then body, tail is (3,1).\n> \n> After move D to (4,1): new head at (4,1), then the body: the segment that was at (4,2) moves to where head was? Snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So after moving head to (4,1), the new positions: head (4,1), then the first body segment was (4,3)? Let's list:\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (4,2) head\n> \n> 1: (4,3)\n> \n> 2: (5,3)\n> \n> 3: (6,3)\n> \n> 4: (6,4)\n> \n> 5: (5,4)\n> \n> 6: (4,4)\n> \n> 7: (3,4)\n> \n> 8: (2,4)\n> \n> 9: (2,3)\n> \n> 10: (2,2)\n> \n> 11: (2,1)\n> \n> 12: (3,1) tail\n> \n> After moving head down to (4,1):\n> \n> New head: (4,1)\n> \n> Then body: segment that was index 0 moves to (4,1), but index 1 moves to where index 0 was, which is (4,2)? Standard snake: the head moves to new position, and each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous one in the list.\n> \n> So new position 0: (4,1)  // new head\n> \n> Position 1: old position 0, which is (4,2)\n> \n> Position 2: old position 1, which is (4,3)\n> \n> Position 3: old position 2, which is (5,3)\n> \n> Position 4: old position 3, (6,3)\n> \n> Position 5: old position 4, (6,4)\n> \n> Position 6: old position 5, (5,4)\n> \n> Position 7: old position 6, (4,4)\n> \n> Position 8: old position 7, (3,4)\n> \n> Position 9: old position 8, (2,4)\n> \n> Position 10: old position 9, (2,3)\n> \n> Position 11: old position 10, (2,2)\n> \n> Position 12: old position 11, (2,1)  // and the tail old position 12 is left, so it disappears, but since no food eaten, length same, tail moves away.\n> \n> Old tail was (3,1), which is now vacated.\n> \n> Now, (2,3) was occupied by segment 9, now it moves to old position 8, which is (2,4)? Old position 9 was (2,3), now it becomes position 10 at (2,3)? After move: position 10 is old position 9, which was (2,3), so (2,3) is still occupied by position 10 now.\n> \n> Let's clarify:\n> \n> New positions after move D:\n> \n> - Head: (4,1)\n> \n> - Then: (4,2)  // was head\n> \n> - Then: (4,3)  // was pos1\n> \n> - Then: (5,3)  // was pos2\n> \n> - Then: (6,3)  // was pos3\n> \n> - Then: (6,4)  // was pos4\n> \n> - Then: (5,4)  // was pos5\n> \n> - Then: (4,4)  // was pos6\n> \n> - Then: (3,4)  // was pos7\n> \n> - Then: (2,4)  // was pos8\n> \n> - Then: (2,3)  // was pos9, still at (2,3)\n> \n> - Then: (2,2)  // was pos10\n> \n> - Then: (2,1)  // was pos11, and tail\n> \n> The last segment was (3,1), which is now gone, and (2,1) is now the tail.\n> \n> So (2,3) is still occupied by the body segment that was at index 9, now at index 10.\n> \n> To eat the food at (2,3), we need the body to move away from it, meaning that segment leaves (2,3), and then later the head moves to (2,3).\n> \n> Currently, it's occupied, so we can't eat it immediately.\n> \n> If I move right to (5,2) instead.\n> \n> From (4,2) move R to (5,2).\n> \n> New head: (5,2)\n> \n> Then body: (4,2) // old head\n> \n> (4,3) // old pos1\n> \n> (5,3) // old pos2\n> \n> (6,3) // old pos3\n> \n> (6,4) // old pos4\n> \n> (5,4) // old pos5\n> \n> (4,4) // old pos6\n> \n> (3,4) // old pos7\n> \n> (2,4) // old pos8\n> \n> (2,3) // old pos9, still at (2,3)\n> \n> (2,2) // old pos10\n> \n> (2,1) // old pos11\n> \n> (3,1) // old pos12, tail, now at (2,1)? Position 11 is old pos10 (2,2), position 12 is old pos11 (2,1), and tail was (3,1) gone.\n> \n> (2,3) still occupied.\n> \n> So in both cases, moving to (4,1) or (5,2) doesn't free (2,3) immediately; it remains occupied.\n> \n> To free (2,3), we need the segment on it to move, which is part of the body.\n> \n> The segment at (2,3) is currently index 9, and it will move when the snake moves, but it moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> For example, when the snake moves, the segment at (2,3) will move to where the segment ahead of it was.\n> \n> Currently, the segment ahead of (2,3) is (2,4) at index 8.\n> \n> So when snake moves, if the head moves somewhere, the segment at (2,4) might move, and then (2,3) will move to (2,4)'s old position.\n> \n> Let's see the positions around (2,3).\n> \n> The snake has: (2,4) above, (2,3) itself, (2,2) below, and (2,1) below that. Also (3,1) to the right at tail.\n> \n> The segment at (2,3) is connected to (2,4) and (2,2). When the snake moves, if the head moves, (2,4) might move to a new position, then (2,3) will move to where (2,4) was.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves, and (2,4) stays or moves, but (2,4) will move to where its previous was.\n> \n> The only way to free (2,3) is for the segment at (2,3) to move away, which happens every move, but it moves to a new cell, so (2,3) might be free if no other segment is there, but in this case, when it moves, it goes to (2,4), so (2,3) is left, but only if no new segment comes.\n> \n> After a move, the cell (2,3) is vacated if the segment that was there moves and no one else moves to it.\n> \n> In the move sequence, when the snake moves forward without eating, the tail leaves its position, and each body segment moves to the next position.\n> \n> For (2,3), it is occupied by a segment that will move to the position of the segment that was ahead of it.\n> \n> Currently, ahead of it is (2,4), so when snake moves, (2,3) will move to (2,4) if (2,4) moves, but (2,4) will move to where its ahead is.\n> \n> Let's trace the movement.\n> \n> The segment at (2,4) is position 8, which is connected to position 7 (3,4) and position 9 (2,3).\n> \n> When the snake moves, position 8 will move to the position that position 7 had before the move, but position 7 might move.\n> \n> It's messy. Better to think that after a move, the cell previously occupied by a body segment might be free if that segment moved and no other segment took its place.\n> \n> Specifically for (2,3), it is currently occupied by position 9.\n> \n> After a move, position 9 will be at the old position of position 8.\n> \n> Position 8 is at (2,4).\n> \n> So if position 8 moves to a new position, then position 9 will move to (2,4), so the cell (2,3) is left empty, unless the tail or something was there, but tail is at (3,1).\n> \n> After the move, (2,3) is free, because position 9 moves to where position 8 was, which is (2,4), so (2,3) is vacated.\n> \n> Similarly, in the earlier example, when I moved D to (4,1), the new position 10 was at (2,3), which was old position 9, so (2,3) is still occupied.\n> \n> After any move where no food is eaten, the tail position is vacated, but (2,3) is not the tail; it's a body segment.\n> \n> The cell (2,3) will be vacated only if the segment that was there moves and no new segment moves to it. But when the snake moves, the segment at (2,3) moves to (2,4), so (2,3) is left empty, and (2,4) is now occupied by that segment.\n> \n> Let's take a smaller example.\n> \n> Suppose snake positions: head at A, then B, then C at (2,3).\n> \n> After move, head moves to new position, say A to A', then B moves to A, C moves to B.\n> \n> So if C was at (2,3), and B was at P, then C moves to P, so (2,3) is no longer occupied by C, and if no other segment was at (2,3), it is free.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,3), it is occupied by C, which moves to where B was, so (2,3) is free after the move.\n> \n> Similarly in our case, after any move, the cell that was occupied by the segment that moved from it is free, unless the new position of another segment is there, but since segments move to specific positions, it should be free.\n> \n> In the move to (4,1), before move, (2,3) occupied by pos9.\n> \n> After move, pos9 is now at old position of pos8, which is (2,4), so the cell (2,3) is no longer occupied by pos9; it is now occupied by nothing, so free, unless another segment moved to it, but in the new positions, the only segments are at new locations: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), etc., and (2,4) is now occupied by pos9, but (2,3) is not in the new positions, so it should be free.\n> \n> Let's list new positions again:\n> \n> After move D to (4,1):\n> \n> - (4,1) - head\n> \n> - (4,2) - was head\n> \n> - (4,3) - was pos1\n> \n> - (5,3) - was pos2\n> \n> - (6,3) - was pos3\n> \n> - (6,4) - was pos4\n> \n> - (5,4) - was pos5\n> \n> - (4,4) - was pos6\n> \n> - (3,4) - was pos7\n> \n> - (2,4) - was pos8\n> \n> - (2,3) - was pos9, now at (2,4)? No: new position for index 10 is old position 9, which is (2,3), so (2,3) is occupied by index 10.\n> \n> I think I have indexing confusion.\n> \n> Define the positions after move.\n> \n> The new snake positions are:\n> \n> - New head: (4,1)\n> \n> - New position 1: old position 0, which is (4,2)\n> \n> - New position 2: old position 1, which is (4,3)\n> \n> - New position 3: old position 2, which is (5,3)\n> \n> - New position 4: old position 3, which is (6,3)\n> \n> - New position 5: old position 4, which is (6,4)\n> \n> - New position 6: old position 5, which is (5,4)\n> \n> - New position 7: old position 6, which is (4,4)\n> \n> - New position 8: old position 7, which is (3,4)\n> \n> - New position 9: old position 8, which is (2,4)\n> \n> - New position 10: old position 9, which is (2,3)  // so (2,3) is still occupied, now by position 10\n> \n> - New position 11: old position 10, which is (2,2)\n> \n> - New position 12: old position 11, which is (2,1)  // and old position 12 (3,1) is gone\n> \n> So (2,3) is still occupied by the body, now at index 10.\n> \n> It never gets freed because the segment on it just moves to the next position in line.\n> \n> To free (2,3), we need the segment that is on it to move away, and no other segment to move into it, but because the snake is connected, when the snake moves, the segment on (2,3) will move to where the previous segment was, so (2,3) is only freed if that segment was the tail and it moves, but here it's not the tail.\n> \n> The tail is at (3,1), which does get freed when it moves.\n> \n> For (2,3), it is always occupied as long as the snake is there, because it's a body segment that moves along.\n> \n> The only way to free a body cell is if the snake shortens or changes shape, but without eating, the length is constant, so the cells remain occupied.\n> \n> But the rules say: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for the body to move away, that means when the snake moves, the segment that was on that cell leaves, and since no new segment comes (because it's not the head position), the cell is free for that moment.\n> \n> In the case of (2,3), when the snake moves, the segment that was at (2,3) moves to a new cell, so (2,3) is empty after the move, until something else happens.\n> \n> But in the new positions, no segment is at (2,3), so it should be free.\n> \n> In the example above, after move, the new positions do not include (2,3) as occupied; it is occupied by new position 10, which is at (2,3)?

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nLet's break down the current state of the game at Turn \\( t_0 = 67 \\):\n\n1. **Grid Layout**:\n   - Dimensions: 8x8 grid (coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n   - Walls:\n     - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n     - Internal Obstacle: (3,2).\n\n2. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: [(6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3)].\n     - Head: (6,1).\n     - Tail: (2,3).\n   - Length: 13 segments.\n   - Current Direction: Down (D).\n\n3. **Food**:\n   - All food has a lifespan of 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n   - Food Items:\n     - (5,5): value = +1.\n     - (5,6): value = +4.\n     - (2,3): value = +7 (currently under the tail).\n     - (4,6): value = +10.\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 67\n\nGiven the snake's current direction is Down (D), the possible moves are:\n- **Down (D)**: (6,0) → y=0 is a wall → Invalid.\n- **Left (L)**: (5,1).\n- **Right (R)**: (7,1) → x=7 is a wall → Invalid.\n- **Up (U)**: Opposite of current direction → Not allowed.\n\nThus, the only possible move is **Left (L) to (5,1)**.\n\n### Checking Validity of Moving Left to (5,1)\n\n1. **Is (5,1) a wall?**\n   - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 → (5,1) is not on the border.\n   - Internal Obstacle: (3,2) → Not (5,1).\n   - Conclusion: Not a wall.\n\n2. **Is (5,1) occupied by the snake's body?**\n   - Current body segments: From (6,2) to (2,3).\n   - (5,1) is not in this list.\n   - Conclusion: Not occupied by the body.\n\n3. **Is there food at (5,1)?**\n   - Food positions: (5,5), (5,6), (2,3), (4,6).\n   - (5,1) is not listed.\n   - Conclusion: No food to eat here.\n\n### Implications of Moving Left\n\n- **No Food Eaten**: The snake's length remains the same (13).\n- **New Head Position**: (5,1).\n- **New Body Positions**:\n  - The previous head (6,1) becomes the first body segment.\n  - The tail (2,3) is removed since no growth occurs.\n- **New Direction**: Left (L), since we moved left.\n\n### Future Moves After Turn 67\n\nAssuming no new food spawns (since it's not specified), the snake must continue moving without eating. Here's how the snake would move in subsequent turns:\n\n1. **Turn 68**:\n   - Head at (5,1), direction L.\n   - Possible moves:\n     - Left (L): (4,1).\n     - Up (U): (5,2) → Occupied by body (from (6,2)).\n     - Down (D): (5,0) → y=0 is a wall.\n   - Only possible move: Left to (4,1).\n\n2. **Turn 69**:\n   - Head at (4,1), direction L.\n   - Possible moves:\n     - Left (L): (3,1).\n     - Up (U): (4,2) → Occupied by body.\n     - Down (D): (4,0) → y=0 is a wall.\n   - Only possible move: Left to (3,1).\n\n3. **Turn 70**:\n   - Head at (3,1), direction L.\n   - Possible moves:\n     - Left (L): (2,1).\n     - Up (U): (3,2) → Internal obstacle (wall).\n     - Down (D): (3,0) → y=0 is a wall.\n   - Only possible move: Left to (2,1).\n\n4. **Turn 71**:\n   - Head at (2,1), direction L.\n   - Possible moves:\n     - Left (L): (1,1).\n     - Up (U): (2,2).\n     - Down (D): (2,0) → y=0 is a wall.\n   - Both Left to (1,1) and Up to (2,2) are possible, but:\n     - Moving Left continues the current path.\n     - Moving Up starts to turn the snake upwards.\n\nGiven that all food disappears after Turn 67, the immediate priority is to avoid collisions and keep the snake alive. Moving Left is the only immediate safe option at Turn 67.\n\n### Special Consideration: Food Under Tail\n\nThere is positive food at (2,3), which is the current tail position. However, to eat it:\n1. The tail must move away from (2,3).\n2. The head must then move onto (2,3).\n\nGiven the current position and the fact that the head is at (6,1), it's impossible to reach (2,3) in one move. Therefore, this food cannot be eaten this turn and will disappear after Turn 67.\n\n### Conclusion for Turn 67\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities:\n- The only possible move is **Left (L) to (5,1)**.\n- No food can be eaten this turn.\n- The snake will continue moving left in subsequent turns unless new food appears.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

So new positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)] — 13 segments? Original 13, after move without eating, length same, so we remove the tail and add new head, so 12 segments? No.\n> \n> Snake mechanics: when moving, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So the tail segment is removed if no growth.\n> \n> So here, head moves from (6,1) to (5,1).

So new positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)] — 13 segments? Original 13, after move without eating, length same, so we remove the tail and add new head, so 12 segments? No.\n> \n> Snake mechanics: when moving, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So the tail segment is removed if no growth.\n> \n> So here, head moves from (6,1) to (5,1). Then segment 1 (6,2) moves to (6,1), segment 2 (5,2) moves to (6,2), segment 3 (4,2) moves to (5,2), and so on, down to segment 12 (2,3) moves to the position of segment 11, which was (2,4)?

Segment indices: segment 3 was (6,2), which moves to where segment 2 was, but segment 2 was (6,1), no.\n> \n> When moving, each segment from 1 to 12 moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So segment 1 (index 1) moves to position of index 0, which is (4,1)\n> \n> Segment 2 (index 2) moves to position of index 1, which was (5,1)\n> \n> Segment 3 (index 3) moves to position of index 2, which was (6,1)\n> \n> Segment 4 (index 4) moves to position of index 3, which was (6,2) — wait, position of index 3 was (6,2), but segment 4 was at (5,2), moves to where segment 3 was, which is (6,2).\n> \n> Similarly, segment 5 (index 5) was at (4,2), moves to where segment 4 was, which is (5,2)\n> \n> Segment 6 (index 6) was at (4,3), moves to where segment 5 was, (4,2)\n> \n> Segment 7 (index 7) was at (5,3), moves to where segment 6 was, (4,3)\n> \n> Segment 8 (index 8) was at (6,3), moves to where segment 7 was, (5,3)\n> \n> Segment 9 (index 9) was at (6,4), moves to where segment 8 was, (6,3)\n> \n> Segment 10 (index 10) was at (5,4), moves to where segment 9 was, (6,4)\n> \n> Segment 11 (index 11) was at (4,4), moves to where segment 10 was, (5,4)\n> \n> Segment 12 (index 12) was at (3,4), moves to where segment 11 was, (4,4)\n> \n> And since no food eaten, the tail is removed, so we lose the last position.\n> \n> New positions after move: head (3,1), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)\n> \n> List:\n> \n> - Head: (3,1)\n> \n> - Seg1: (4,1)\n> \n> - Seg2: (5,1)\n> \n> - Seg3: (6,1)\n> \n> - Seg4: (6,2)\n> \n> - Seg5: (5,2)\n> \n> - Seg6: (4,2)\n> \n> - Seg7: (4,3)\n> \n> - Seg8: (5,3)\n> \n> - Seg9: (6,3)\n> \n> - Seg10: (6,4)\n> \n> - Seg11: (5,4)\n> \n> - Seg12: (4,4)\n> \n> Tail is (4,4), which was previously segment 11, but now it's the last segment.\n> \n> Number of segments: originally 13, after move without eating, still 13? No.\n> \n> Original positions: 13 segments.\n> \n> After move: head moves to new position, and each body segment shifts, but the tail position is not reoccupied, so the snake shortens? No.\n> \n> In snake game, when no food eaten, the snake moves forward, so the tail cell is vacated, so the snake has the same number of segments, but the positions shift.\n> \n> Original: 13 positions.\n> \n> After move: head to (3,1), then seg1 to (4,1), seg2 to (5,1), ..., up to seg12 to (4,4). But original seg12 was (3,4), which is now gone. The new positions are from head to the second last segment shifted, and the tail is removed.\n> \n> Let's count the new positions:\n> \n> - New head: (3,1)\n> \n> - Then: (4,1)  // prev head\n> \n> - (5,1)  // prev seg1\n> \n> - (6,1)  // prev seg2\n> \n> - (6,2)  // prev seg3\n> \n> - (5,2)  // prev seg4\n> \n> - (4,2)  // prev seg5\n> \n> - (4,3)  // prev seg6\n> \n> - (5,3)  // prev seg7\n> \n> - (6,3)  // prev seg8\n> \n> - (6,4)  // prev seg9\n> \n> - (5,4)  // prev seg10\n> \n> - (4,4)  // prev seg11\n> \n> Prev seg11 was (4,4), and prev seg12 (3,4) is not included, so new snake has 12 segments?

So the new snake has positions from (3,1) to (4,4), which is 13 positions? New positions 0 to 12, but position 12 is (4,4), which was prev pos 11, so it's only 12 segments?

It's turn 71. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,2).

So the tail is at (5,4).

The head direction is up, meaning it moved to (2,3) from below, so it was coming from (2,2) since the previous position is (2,2) in the list.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)]\n> \n> So the head is at (2,3), and the tail is at (6,4). The head direction is U, so it's facing up.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1, life span 4 (so it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, so at turn 73, life span 4 means it will disappear after turn 76? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it's gone at the start of turn t+L or something? I need to be careful.\n> \n> Typically, if life_span is L at turn t, it decreases each turn, so after L turns, it should be gone. For example, at turn t, life_span L, after one turn (turn t+1), life_span becomes L-1, and so on, until life_span=0, then it disappears before turn starts or after? The problem says \"disappears after N turns\", and countdown decreases including current turn.\n> \n> Let's read: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, food has life_span L. After turn t is processed, life_span becomes L-1. If L-1 > 0, it remains; if L-1 = 0, it disappears after this turn. But since we're at turn t, and we make a move, after the move, the state updates.\n> \n> I think it's better to think that at the beginning of turn t, if life_span is L, then after this turn, life_span decreases by 1. So at the start of turn t, life_span L means it has L turns left, including the current turn. After turn t, if L>1, it has L-1 left; if L=1, it disappears after this turn.\n> \n> For food at (4,6): life_span 4 at turn 73. So after turn 73, it will have life_span 3; after turn 74, life_span 2; after turn 75, life_span 1; after turn 76, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 73 to 76 inclusive? At turn 76, if life_span is 1, and we eat it, it should be fine, then it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,2): value 1, life_span 7, so it will disappear after turn 79? Turn 73: life_span 7, after turn 73: 6, ..., after turn 79: life_span 0, disappears.\n> \n> Life_span decreases after each turn, including current. So at turn t, before move, life_span L. After move and state update, life_span becomes L-1 for the next turn.\n> \n> But for eating, we eat during the move on turn t.\n> \n> For food at (4,6): at turn 73, life_span 4, so it can be eaten on turn 73,74,75,76? On turn 76, if life_span was 1, and we eat, then it's consumed, and life_span doesn't decrease further.\n> \n> The disappearance happens after the life_span countdown reaches zero after the turn.\n> \n> I think I should not overcomplicate; for now, I'll assume that food is available until its life_span reaches 0, and it can be eaten on any turn as long as life_span >0 at the start of the turn.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,6): value +1, life_span 4 (available for 4 turns including current)\n> \n> - (6,2): value +1, life_span 7\n> \n> - (6,4): value +1, life_span 10\n> \n> All are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, special case: food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten when head moves to it after body moves away.\n> \n> In this state, look at food positions: (4,6), (6,2), (6,4)\n> \n> Snake positions: head (2,3), then (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)\n> \n> (6,2) is a food position, but (6,2) is also occupied by the snake body? Let's see: snake has (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), etc. Yes, (6,2) is the 8th segment in the list, index 7 if 0-based: positions[7] is (6,2).\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) is food, and (6,4) is the tail, positions[13] is (6,4).\n> \n> And (4,6) is not occupied by snake, I think. Snake positions: y-coordinates are from 1 to 4, x from 2 to 6, so (4,6) is free.\n> \n> (4,6) is at x=4,y=6, which should be within bounds, no wall mentioned except borders and (3,2).\n> \n> Walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle (3,2).\n> \n> So (4,6) is not wall, not snake, so it's free for food.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) is occupied by snake body, and (6,4) is occupied by tail.\n> \n> Food at (6,2) is under the snake body, so it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,4), it's under the tail.\n> \n> Now, head is at (2,3), direction U, so it can move up to (2,4), left to (1,3), right to (3,3), but not down since it would reverse, and head direction is U, so moving down would be opposite, which is not allowed? No instant reverse rule.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, so possible moves: U, L, R. Not D, because D is opposite to U.\n> \n> The rule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> So from U, cannot move D; similarly, from L cannot move R, etc.\n> \n> Here head direction U, so possible actions: U (up), L (left), R (right). D is invalid.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Also internal obstacle at (3,2), so (3,2) is wall.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> List them to visualize:\n> \n> Row y=4: (6,4) tail\n> \n> y=3: head (2,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n> \n> y=2: (2,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) — (6,2) is body, but food is there?

Snake: (2,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) — so (1,2), (3,2) wall, (4,2) snake, (5,2) snake, (6,2) snake, (7,2) wall.

To eat it, the tail must move away, and then head moves to (6,4). But since it's the tail, when snake moves without eating, tail moves, so if we move such that tail leaves (6,4), then (6,4) is free, and head can move there later to eat.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,2), it's under a body segment, not tail.\n> \n> Let's list the snake segments in order: indices 0: (2,3) head, 1: (2,2), 2: (2,1), 3: (3,1), 4: (4,1), 5: (5,1), 6: (6,1), 7: (6,2), 8: (5,2), 9: (4,2), 10: (4,3), 11: (5,3), 12: (6,3), 13: (6,4) tail.\n> \n> Food at (6,2) is at position 7, which is a body segment.\n> \n> Food at (6,4) is at position 13, tail.\n> \n> To eat (6,2), since it's under body, we need the snake to move so that segment 7 moves away from (6,2), and then later head moves to (6,2).\n> \n> Similarly for (6,4), tail needs to move away.\n> \n> But tail only moves when no food is eaten; if we eat food, tail stays, length increases.\n> \n> Also, there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, for (6,4), it's the tail cell with food, so if head is adjacent to (6,4) and we eat it, we die.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,2), it's not tail, so no such danger, but it might be occupied.\n> \n> First, let's consider possible actions for turn 73.\n> \n> Head at (2,3), dir U.\n> \n> Move U to (2,4): (2,4) is free, no food, so no eat, snake moves, tail moves to next position.

        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 74 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(3, 2)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: U\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (4, 6, 3, 1)\n\t- (6, 2, 6, 1)\n\t- (6, 4, 9, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 73 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 73, and I'm playing Snake on a grid from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls at the borders and one internal obstacle at (3,2). The snake positions are: head at (2,3), then body segments down to (6,4). The head direction is up, meaning it moved to (2,3) from below, so it was coming from (2,2) since the previous position is (2,2) in the list.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)]\n> \n> So the head is at (2,3), and the tail is at (6,4). The head direction is U, so it's facing up.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1, life span 4 (so it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, so at turn 73, life span 4 means it will disappear after turn 76? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it's gone at the start of turn t+L or something? I need to be careful.\n> \n> Typically, if life_span is L at turn t, it decreases each turn, so after L turns, it should be gone. For example, at turn t, life_span L, after one turn (turn t+1), life_span becomes L-1, and so on, until life_span=0, then it disappears before turn starts or after? The problem says \"disappears after N turns\", and countdown decreases including current turn.\n> \n> Let's read: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, food has life_span L. After turn t is processed, life_span becomes L-1. If L-1 > 0, it remains; if L-1 = 0, it disappears after this turn. But since we're at turn t, and we make a move, after the move, the state updates.\n> \n> I think it's better to think that at the beginning of turn t, if life_span is L, then after this turn, life_span decreases by 1. So at the start of turn t, life_span L means it has L turns left, including the current turn. After turn t, if L>1, it has L-1 left; if L=1, it disappears after this turn.\n> \n> For food at (4,6): life_span 4 at turn 73. So after turn 73, it will have life_span 3; after turn 74, life_span 2; after turn 75, life_span 1; after turn 76, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 73 to 76 inclusive? At turn 76, if life_span is 1, and we eat it, it should be fine, then it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,2): value 1, life_span 7, so it will disappear after turn 79? Turn 73: life_span 7, after turn 73: 6, ..., after turn 79: life_span 0, disappears.\n> \n> Life_span decreases after each turn, including current. So at turn t, before move, life_span L. After move and state update, life_span becomes L-1 for the next turn.\n> \n> But for eating, we eat during the move on turn t.\n> \n> For food at (4,6): at turn 73, life_span 4, so it can be eaten on turn 73,74,75,76? On turn 76, if life_span was 1, and we eat, then it's consumed, and life_span doesn't decrease further.\n> \n> The disappearance happens after the life_span countdown reaches zero after the turn.\n> \n> I think I should not overcomplicate; for now, I'll assume that food is available until its life_span reaches 0, and it can be eaten on any turn as long as life_span >0 at the start of the turn.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,6): value +1, life_span 4 (available for 4 turns including current)\n> \n> - (6,2): value +1, life_span 7\n> \n> - (6,4): value +1, life_span 10\n> \n> All are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, special case: food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten when head moves to it after body moves away.\n> \n> In this state, look at food positions: (4,6), (6,2), (6,4)\n> \n> Snake positions: head (2,3), then (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)\n> \n> (6,2) is a food position, but (6,2) is also occupied by the snake body? Let's see: snake has (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), etc. Yes, (6,2) is the 8th segment in the list, index 7 if 0-based: positions[7] is (6,2).\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) is food, and (6,4) is the tail, positions[13] is (6,4).\n> \n> And (4,6) is not occupied by snake, I think. Snake positions: y-coordinates are from 1 to 4, x from 2 to 6, so (4,6) is free.\n> \n> (4,6) is at x=4,y=6, which should be within bounds, no wall mentioned except borders and (3,2).\n> \n> Walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle (3,2).\n> \n> So (4,6) is not wall, not snake, so it's free for food.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) is occupied by snake body, and (6,4) is occupied by tail.\n> \n> Food at (6,2) is under the snake body, so it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,4), it's under the tail.\n> \n> Now, head is at (2,3), direction U, so it can move up to (2,4), left to (1,3), right to (3,3), but not down since it would reverse, and head direction is U, so moving down would be opposite, which is not allowed? No instant reverse rule.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, so possible moves: U, L, R. Not D, because D is opposite to U.\n> \n> The rule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> So from U, cannot move D; similarly, from L cannot move R, etc.\n> \n> Here head direction U, so possible actions: U (up), L (left), R (right).

It's turn 75. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,2).

But since it's facing right, I can't immediately reverse to left on the next turn.

Since current turn is 75, it will be gone by turn 77? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 75, life span is 2, so after this turn (turn 75), it becomes 1, and after turn 76, it becomes 0 and disappears.

Only U or D possible.\n   - Future planning: Need to avoid trapping the snake, but this is the only move that gives immediate reward.\n\n2. **Move U to (5, 5)** or **D to (5, 3)**:\n   - No immediate reward.\n   - Avoids growing the snake, which may help in future maneuvers (e.g., freeing (6,2) for eating later).\n   - But (6,4) food has a longer life span (6 turns), so it can be eaten later.\n\n### Risks:\n- Moving R to (6,4) grows the snake, making it harder to maneuver in the tight space (especially near the tail at (4,2)).\n- Not moving R means missing an easy +1 score, but the food at (6,4) will remain for a few more turns.\n\n### Decision:\nThe best immediate action is to **move R to (6,4)** to eat the food and maximize score, while ensuring the snake can still maneuver in future turns (e.g., by moving U or D next). The food at (6,2) is currently blocked by the snake's body and cannot be eaten immediately, so prioritizing (6,4) is optimal.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 79, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 80? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

Countdown starts at 7 on turn 79, decreases to 6 on turn 80, ..., to 0 on turn 85, so disappears after turn 85, meaning last chance to eat is turn 85?

After head moves, the body segments shift: the new position i becomes old position i-1 for i>=1, and tail is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> Specifically: if head moves to a cell without food, then new positions: head at new position, seg1 at old seg0, seg2 at old seg1, ..., seg14 at old seg13, and old seg14 (tail) is removed.\n> \n> If head eats food, then new positions: head at new position, seg1 at old seg0, ..., but no removal, so tail stays, and a new segment is added at the tail position? No.\n> \n> When snake eats food, the tail does not move, so length increases by one. The head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but since tail doesn't move, the last segment remains, so the new tail is the old tail, and a new segment is added at the head? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to food, it eats, so the tail doesn't retract, meaning the snake grows by one cell. So positions: new head at food cell, then the previous head position becomes the new seg1, and so on, down to the tail which stays in place.\n> \n> For example: suppose head at A, seg1 at B, tail at C. If head moves to D (no food), then new head at D, seg1 at A, tail at B (C removed).\n> \n> If head moves to D with food, then new head at D, seg1 at A, and tail still at C, no removal, so positions are head, A, B, C — so length increased, tail C remains.\n> \n> In terms of positions: before move: positions [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk]\n> \n> After move to new cell Q:\n> \n> - If Q has no food: new positions [Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}]  // Pk removed\n> \n> - If Q has food: new positions [Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk]  // no removal, length increases\n> \n> In the food case, Pk remains, so the tail stays.\n> \n> Back to (6,2): it's currently occupied by seg13. To eat the food there, we need that when head moves to (6,2), the cell (6,2) must be free, meaning that seg13 has moved away before that.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,2), it's tail, so if head moves to (5,2), it can eat it, and since tail doesn't move, it grows.\n> \n> But Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision because after eating, the tail doesn't move, so head is on the food, and the new tail is the old tail, but since head was adjacent, after growth, head and tail are on adjacent cells, but not necessarily collided, unless they were the same cell.\n> \n> \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide\" — I think it means that after eating, the head is on the food cell, and since tail doesn't move, if they were adjacent before, after growth, the head is on food, and the tail is still there, but now the body includes the old tail and the head is new position, but they are different cells.\n> \n> For example, suppose tail at T, head at H adjacent to T. Head moves to T to eat food. After eating, new head at T, and the previous positions: new seg1 is old head H, new seg2 is old seg1, etc., and the tail is still old tail T? No.\n> \n> Positions before: [H, A, B, ..., T] with H adjacent to T.\n> \n> Head moves to T (which has food). After move: new positions [T, H, A, B, ..., T] but T is duplicated? No.\n> \n> The cell T has food, so when head moves to T, it eats food. New positions: the head is at T, then the first body segment is at the old head position H, then old seg1, ..., up to old tail T. So positions: [T, H, A, B, ..., S, T] where S is the second last segment before tail.\n> \n> Since the tail T is included, and head is also at T, so head and tail are at the same position, collision, death.\n> \n> Yes, that's why it's dangerous. Because after moving to the tail cell with food, the head is at the same position as the tail, causing collision.\n> \n> Hence, if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, moving to it causes death.\n> \n> Otherwise, if not adjacent, it's safe to eat food on tail.\n> \n> In this case, head (6,5) and tail (5,2) are not adjacent, so eating (5,2) is possible without danger.\n> \n> Similarly, for (6,2), it's body, not tail, so to eat it, need to vacate it first.\n> \n> Back to turn 79.\n> \n> Food at (6,2) has short life, only until turn 80.\n> \n> If I want to eat it, I need to do so by turn 80.\n> \n> First, the cell (6,2) is occupied by seg13.

So (6,6): x=6, y=6. y=6 is border? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=7 is wall, y=0 is wall. y from 1 to 6 should be playable, but y=7 is wall, so (6,6) has y=6, which is not 7, so should be ok? Grid: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells with y=1 to y=6 are free, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), so (6,6) should be free.\n> \n> x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,2).\n> \n> So (6,6) is within bounds, not a wall.\n> \n> Now, is it occupied by snake?

But let's list all positions: (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), ..., (6,1), (6,2), (5,2). y=6 is not listed, so (6,6) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, other moves.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,5):\n> \n> - Up: to (6,6) - possible, since not wall, not body (yet)\n> \n> - Down: to (6,4) - but (6,4) is the second segment, body, so if I move down, head collides with body, death.\n> \n> Cannot move down.\n> \n> - Left: to (5,5) - possible? x=5, y=5.

When head moves to a new cell, if no food, tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed. If food, tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> But in this case, to eat food at (6,2), which is currently occupied, we need that when the snake moves, the segment that was at (6,2) moves away, and then in a future move, head moves to (6,2).\n> \n> Currently, at turn 79, positions: let's index them.\n> \n> Head: seg0: (6,5)\n> \n> seg1: (6,4)\n> \n> seg2: (5,4)\n> \n> seg3: (4,4)\n> \n> seg4: (3,4)\n> \n> seg5: (2,4)\n> \n> seg6: (2,3)\n> \n> seg7: (2,2)\n> \n> seg8: (2,1)\n> \n> seg9: (3,1)\n> \n> seg10: (4,1)\n> \n> seg11: (5,1)\n> \n> seg12: (6,1)\n> \n> seg13: (6,2)\n> \n> seg14: (5,2)  // tail\n> \n> Now, when snake moves, depending on direction, head moves, then each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So if I move Up to (6,6), new head: (6,6)\n> \n> Then seg1: was (6,4) but now becomes the position of old seg0? After head moves, the body segments shift: the new position i becomes old position i-1 for i>=1, and tail is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> Specifically: if head moves to a cell without food, then new positions: head at new position, seg1 at old seg0, seg2 at old seg1, ..., seg14 at old seg13, and old seg14 (tail) is removed.\n> \n> If head eats food, then new positions: head at new position, seg1 at old seg0, ..., but no removal, so tail stays, and a new segment is added at the tail position? No.\n> \n> When snake eats food, the tail does not move, so length increases by one. The head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but since tail doesn't move, the last segment remains, so the new tail is the old tail, and a new segment is added at the head? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to food, it eats, so the tail doesn't retract, meaning the snake grows by one cell. So positions: new head at food cell, then the previous head position becomes the new seg1, and so on, down to the tail which stays in place.\n> \n> For example: suppose head at A, seg1 at B, tail at C. If head moves to D (no food), then new head at D, seg1 at A, tail at B (C removed).\n> \n> If head moves to D with food, then new head at D, seg1 at A, and tail still at C, no removal, so positions are head, A, B, C — so length increased, tail C remains.\n> \n> In terms of positions: before move: positions [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk]\n> \n> After move to new cell Q:\n> \n> - If Q has no food: new positions [Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}]  // Pk removed\n> \n> - If Q has food: new positions [Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk]  // no removal, length increases\n> \n> In the food case, Pk remains, so the tail stays.\n> \n> Back to (6,2): it's currently occupied by seg13. To eat the food there, we need that when head moves to (6,2), the cell (6,2) must be free, meaning that seg13 has moved away before that.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,2), it's tail, so if head moves to (5,2), it can eat it, and since tail doesn't move, it grows.\n> \n> But Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision because after eating, the tail doesn't move, so head is on the food, and the new tail is the old tail, but since head was adjacent, after growth, head and tail are on adjacent cells, but not necessarily collided, unless they were the same cell.\n> \n> \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide\" — I think it means that after eating, the head is on the food cell, and since tail doesn't move, if they were adjacent before, after growth, the head is on food, and the tail is still there, but now the body includes the old tail and the head is new position, but they are different cells.\n> \n> For example, suppose tail at T, head at H adjacent to T. Head moves to T to eat food. After eating, new head at T, and the previous positions: new seg1 is old head H, new seg2 is old seg1, etc., and the tail is still old tail T? No.\n> \n> Positions before: [H, A, B, ..., T] with H adjacent to T.\n> \n> Head moves to T (which has food). After move: new positions [T, H, A, B, ..., T] but T is duplicated? No.\n> \n> The cell T has food, so when head moves to T, it eats food. New positions: the head is at T, then the first body segment is at the old head position H, then old seg1, ..., up to old tail T. So positions: [T, H, A, B, ..., S, T] where S is the second last segment before tail.\n> \n> Since the tail T is included, and head is also at T, so head and tail are at the same position, collision, death.\n> \n> Yes, that's why it's dangerous. Because after moving to the tail cell with food, the head is at the same position as the tail, causing collision.\n> \n> Hence, if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, moving to it causes death.\n> \n> Otherwise, if not adjacent, it's safe to eat food on tail.\n> \n> In this case, head (6,5) and tail (5,2) are not adjacent, so eating (5,2) is possible without danger.\n> \n> Similarly, for (6,2), it's body, not tail, so to eat it, need to vacate it first.\n> \n> Back to turn 79.\n> \n> Food at (6,2) has short life, only until turn 80.\n> \n> If I want to eat it, I need to do so by turn 80.\n> \n> First, the cell (6,2) is occupied by seg13.

It's turn 81. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (3,2). So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with (3,2) blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (4,5), and the body goes to (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). That's 15 segments. Head direction is L, meaning left, so it was moving left last turn.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1 and life span 6. So it disappears after turn 81 + 6 = 87? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 81, life span is 6, meaning it will be there for 6 more turns including turn 81. After turn 86, it's gone? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at turn t with life span L, it will be present from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and disappear at turn t + L. Here, turn 81, life span 6, so it will be there until turn 86 (since 81 to 86 is 6 turns: 81,82,83,84,85,86), and disappear at turn 87. Similarly for the other food.\n> \n> - (5,2) with value 1 and life span 8, so it will be there until turn 88 (81+8-1=88? Let's calculate: from turn 81 to 81+7=88, since life span 8 means 8 turns including current, so turns 81,82,...,88, gone at 89.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for the next 5+ turns to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. It's 8x8, but borders are walls, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable except (3,2) is an obstacle.\n> \n> List all occupied cells:\n> \n> Snake: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n> \n> So the snake is long, 15 segments.\n> \n> Food at (3,5) and (5,2).\n> \n> Head is at (4,5), moving left. So from (4,5), it can move U, D, L, R? But head direction is L, so it was moving left to (4,5). Now, for next move, it can choose U, D, L, R, but cannot instantly reverse to right (R) because that would be opposite to current direction L.\n> \n> Current head direction L means last move was left, so from (5,5) to (4,5) I assume. Positions: head (4,5), then (5,5), so yes, it moved from (5,5) to (4,5) by moving left.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,5):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (4,6)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (4,4)\n> \n> - Left (L): to (3,5)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (5,5)\n> \n> But (5,5) is occupied by the body, so moving right would collide with body at (5,5). Also, (4,4) is occupied by body? Positions: (4,5) head, then (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), ... so (4,4) is occupied, yes.\n> \n> List free cells around head:\n> \n> - (4,6): is this within bounds? y=6, y=7 is border, so y=6 is valid? Borders: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are playable. Similarly x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are inside. Similarly x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> So (4,6): y=6, which is not y=7 or y=0, so it should be playable, but is it a wall? Border walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (4,6) has x=4 between 1-6, y=6 not 0 or 7, so it's not a border wall. Internal obstacles only (3,2), so (4,6) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4): but (4,4) is occupied by snake body, so not free.\n> \n> (3,5): let's see, (3,5) is where food is, but is it occupied? Snake positions: head (4,5), then (5,5), etc. (3,5) is not in snake positions, so it should be free, but there's food there, which can be eaten.\n> \n> (5,5) is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,5):\n> \n> - U to (4,6): is it free? No snake or wall? Snake: not in positions, wall: not border, not obstacle, so free.\n> \n> - D to (4,4): but (4,4) is occupied by snake body, so collision if move there.\n> \n> - L to (3,5): (3,5) has food, but not occupied by snake, so it's free to move, and eating food.\n> \n> - R to (5,5): occupied by snake body, collision.\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite instantly, but R is opposite to L, so even if free, cannot move R because it would be instant reverse? No instant reverse rule: \"cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\". Current direction is L (left), so opposite is R (right). So moving right is invalid because it's instant reverse.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left is same direction, not opposite.\n> \n> So valid moves: U, D, L? D to (4,4) is occupied, so not possible. R is invalid and occupied.\n> \n> So only possible moves: U to (4,6) or L to (3,5).\n> \n> L to (3,5) has food, which is positive food, value +1, length increases.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> First, let's see the food at (3,5). If I move left to (3,5), I eat the food, so score +1, length becomes 16, and the food disappears.\n> \n> But there's a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Now, where is the tail? Snake positions: last segment is (6,1). Tail is at (6,1).\n> \n> Head at (4,5), tail at (6,1), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so Manhattan distance 1.\n> \n> (4,5) to (6,1): dx=2, dy=4, not adjacent. So no issue.\n> \n> But after eating, tail grows, so the new tail will be added, but since I ate, the tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail remains, and new segment added? Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so next move, tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> In terms of collision, when you eat, head moves to food, consumes it, and the tail stays in place for that turn, so the new position has head at food, body follows, but since tail didn't move, it effectively grows by one.\n> \n> Then next turn, when you move, the tail moves.\n> \n> But for tail reward danger: it says if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> Here, tail is at (6,1), head at (4,5), not adjacent. After eating, head at (3,5), tail still at (6,1) until next move, so still not adjacent. So no problem.\n> \n> But (3,5) is food, so eating it is fine.\n> \n> Now, the other food is at (5,2), which is below.\n> \n> I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, the snake is long, so space might be tight.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid 6x6 playable, rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n> \n> Obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (4,5)\n> \n> Body: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n> \n> So the snake is coiled around the left and bottom.\n> \n> Specifically, from head (4,5) left to (3,4)?

        "thinking": "Let's analyze the current state at turn \\( t_0 = 82 \\) based on the guidance from the previous thinking model at turn \\( t_1 = 81 \\).\n\n### Current State at Turn 82:\n- **Snake Positions**: [(3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1)]\n  - Head at (3, 5), moving left (L).\n  - Tail at (6, 1).\n- **Food**:\n  - (5, 2): value +1, life span 7 (disappears at turn 89).\n  - (3, 6): value +1, life span 10 (disappears at turn 92).\n- **Walls**: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle at (3, 2).\n\n### Possible Moves from (3, 5) at Turn 82:\nFrom the head at (3, 5), current direction is L (left). Possible moves:\n1. **Up (U)**: (3, 6)\n   - Check: (3, 6) is within bounds, not a wall, not occupied by snake. \n   - Contains food (3, 6) with value +1.\n2. **Down (D)**: (3, 4)\n   - Check: (3, 4) is occupied by snake body (part of the body). Invalid (collision).\n3. **Left (L)**: (2, 5)\n   - Check: (2, 5) is within bounds, not a wall, not occupied by snake. No food.\n4. **Right (R)**: (4, 5)\n   - Check: (4, 5) is occupied by snake body. Also, R is opposite to current direction L, so invalid (instant reverse).\n\nValid moves: U (to (3, 6)) or L (to (2, 5)).\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **Move U to (3, 6)**:\n   - Eat food at (3, 6): score +1, length increases to 17.\n   - New head at (3, 6), direction U.\n   - Next possible moves from (3, 6):\n     - U: (3, 7) is a wall (invalid).\n     - D: (3, 5) is occupied by snake body (invalid).\n     - L: (2, 6) is free.\n     - R: (4, 6) is free.\n   - No immediate collision risk. Can plan to reach (5, 2) later.\n\n2. **Move L to (2, 5)**:\n   - No food eaten. Length remains 16.\n   - New head at (2, 5), direction L.\n   - Next possible moves from (2, 5):\n     - U: (2, 6) is free.\n     - D: (2, 4) is occupied by snake body (invalid).\n     - L: (1, 5) is free.\n     - R: (3, 5) is occupied by snake body (invalid).\n   - Avoids growing the snake, but delays eating.\n\n### Decision:\n- The food at (3, 6) is safe to eat (no tail reward danger, as tail is at (6, 1), not adjacent).\n- Eating now gives +1 score and grows the snake, but the snake is already long (16). However, the space is tight, and avoiding growth might not help much.\n- Moving L to (2, 5) avoids growth but doesn't contribute to score and may not free up space quickly.\n\nGiven the tight space and the need to maximize score, the best immediate action is to eat the food at (3, 6).\n\n### Final Action:\n\\boxed{U}",

It's turn 81. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (3,2). So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with (3,2) blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (4,5), and the body goes to (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). That's 15 segments. Head direction is L, meaning left, so it was moving left last turn.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1 and life span 6. So it disappears after turn 81 + 6 = 87? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 81, life span is 6, meaning it will be there for 6 more turns including turn 81. After turn 86, it's gone? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at turn t with life span L, it will be present from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and disappear at turn t + L. Here, turn 81, life span 6, so it will be there until turn 86 (since 81 to 86 is 6 turns: 81,82,83,84,85,86), and disappear at turn 87. Similarly for the other food.\n> \n> - (5,2) with value 1 and life span 8, so it will be there until turn 88 (81+8-1=88?

So from (4,5), it can move U, D, L, R? But head direction is L, so it was moving left to (4,5). Now, for next move, it can choose U, D, L, R, but cannot instantly reverse to right (R) because that would be opposite to current direction L.\n> \n> Current head direction L means last move was left, so from (5,5) to (4,5) I assume. Positions: head (4,5), then (5,5), so yes, it moved from (5,5) to (4,5) by moving left.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,5):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (4,6)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (4,4)\n> \n> - Left (L): to (3,5)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (5,5)\n> \n> But (5,5) is occupied by the body, so moving right would collide with body at (5,5). Also, (4,4) is occupied by body? Positions: (4,5) head, then (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), ... so (4,4) is occupied, yes.\n> \n> List free cells around head:\n> \n> - (4,6): is this within bounds? y=6, y=7 is border, so y=6 is valid? Borders: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are playable. Similarly x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are inside. Similarly x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> So (4,6): y=6, which is not y=7 or y=0, so it should be playable, but is it a wall? Border walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (4,6) has x=4 between 1-6, y=6 not 0 or 7, so it's not a border wall. Internal obstacles only (3,2), so (4,6) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4): but (4,4) is occupied by snake body, so not free.\n> \n> (3,5): let's see, (3,5) is where food is, but is it occupied? Snake positions: head (4,5), then (5,5), etc. (3,5) is not in snake positions, so it should be free, but there's food there, which can be eaten.\n> \n> (5,5) is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,5):\n> \n> - U to (4,6): is it free? No snake or wall? Snake: not in positions, wall: not border, not obstacle, so free.\n> \n> - D to (4,4): but (4,4) is occupied by snake body, so collision if move there.\n> \n> - L to (3,5): (3,5) has food, but not occupied by snake, so it's free to move, and eating food.\n> \n> - R to (5,5): occupied by snake body, collision.\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite instantly, but R is opposite to L, so even if free, cannot move R because it would be instant reverse? No instant reverse rule: \"cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\". Current direction is L (left), so opposite is R (right). So moving right is invalid because it's instant reverse.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left is same direction, not opposite.\n> \n> So valid moves: U, D, L? D to (4,4) is occupied, so not possible. R is invalid and occupied.\n> \n> So only possible moves: U to (4,6) or L to (3,5).\n> \n> L to (3,5) has food, which is positive food, value +1, length increases.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> First, let's see the food at (3,5). If I move left to (3,5), I eat the food, so score +1, length becomes 16, and the food disappears.\n> \n> But there's a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Now, where is the tail? Snake positions: last segment is (6,1). Tail is at (6,1).\n> \n> Head at (4,5), tail at (6,1), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so Manhattan distance 1.\n> \n> (4,5) to (6,1): dx=2, dy=4, not adjacent. So no issue.\n> \n> But after eating, tail grows, so the new tail will be added, but since I ate, the tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail remains, and new segment added? Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so next move, tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> In terms of collision, when you eat, head moves to food, consumes it, and the tail stays in place for that turn, so the new position has head at food, body follows, but since tail didn't move, it effectively grows by one.\n> \n> Then next turn, when you move, the tail moves.\n> \n> But for tail reward danger: it says if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> Here, tail is at (6,1), head at (4,5), not adjacent. After eating, head at (3,5), tail still at (6,1) until next move, so still not adjacent. So no problem.\n> \n> But (3,5) is food, so eating it is fine.\n> \n> Now, the other food is at (5,2), which is below.\n> \n> I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, the snake is long, so space might be tight.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid 6x6 playable, rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n> \n> Obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (4,5)\n> \n> Body: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n> \n> So the snake is coiled around the left and bottom.\n> \n> Specifically, from head (4,5) left to (3,4)?

Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at turn t with life span L, it will be present from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and disappear at turn t + L.

Thus, ignore this food.\n\n### Move Evaluation:\n1. **Move Left (L) to (1, 6)**:\n   - (1, 6) is free (not a wall or body).\n   - Next possible moves from (1, 6):\n     - Down (D) to (1, 5) → Free.\n     - Up (U) to (1, 7) → Invalid (wall).\n     - Right (R) to (2, 6) → Invalid (reverse direction).\n   - This path leads to the left edge, potentially limiting future mobility.\n\n2. **Move Down (D) to (2, 5)**:\n   - (2, 5) is free (not a wall or body).\n   - Next possible moves from (2, 5):\n     - Left (L) to (1, 5) → Free.\n     - Down (D) to (2, 4) → Occupied by body (invalid).\n   - This path also leads to the left edge but avoids immediate dead ends.\n\n### Decision:\nBoth moves are safe, but moving **Down (D)** to (2, 5) is slightly better because:\n- It keeps the snake centered rather than pushing it to the edge.\n- It avoids potential trapping near the left wall in future turns.\n\n### Final Action:\n\\boxed{D}",

It's turn 84, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and food.\n> \n> **Grid Setup:**\n> - Walls: Border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, an internal obstacle at (3,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but borders are walls, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6) except for the obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> **Snake Positions:**\n> - Snake body: [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)]\n> - Head is at (2,6), and direction is L (left). Since the head is at (2,6) and moving left, that means it came from the right, so previous position was (3,6), which is the second segment.\n> \n> **Food:**\n> - There's one food item at (5,2) with value 1 and life span 5. Life span decreases every turn, including current, so after turn 84, it will have 4 turns left, then 3, and so on until it disappears.\n> \n> **Movement Constraints:**\n> - I can move U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> - No instant reverse: Since current direction is L, I cannot move R on the next turn. So possible moves from (2,6) are U, D, or L, but not R.\n> \n> **Deadly Collisions:**\n> - Collision with body or wall kills the snake. But I can move into the tail cell if it's moving away, because the tail moves forward when the snake eats or not.\n> \n> **Food Mechanics:**\n> - Positive food: +1 score, snake length +1.\n> - Negative food: -1 score, length unchanged. But in this case, the food at (5,2) has value 1, so it's positive food.\n> - Life-span: Disappears after N turns; here, life span 5, starting from turn 84.\n> - Food under body: Can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it. But here, food is at (5,2), which is not under the snake body currently. Let's check the snake positions: (2,1) to (5,1) are at y=1, (2,2) at y=2, but (5,2) is not in the list, so it's free. Snake has segments from (2,1) to (5,1) at bottom, then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), etc. up to head at (2,6). So (5,2) is not occupied by snake.\n> - Tail Reward Danger: If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide. But tail is at (5,1), since positions: head (2,6), then body, tail is last, (5,1). Food is at (5,2), which is above the tail? (5,1) is tail, (5,2) is directly above it.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,1), food at (5,2). If the head were to move to (5,2), but head is at (2,6), far away. So not an immediate concern.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's visualize the grid. I'll sketch a rough map.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and (3,2).\n> \n> Playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (3,2) is wall.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> - Head: (2,6)\n> - Body: (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)  // that's 17 segments, including head? List has 17 positions: indices 0 to 16, head at 0, tail at 16 which is (5,1).\n> \n> So snake length is 17.\n> \n> Food at (5,2), value 1, life span 5 turns including current, so it will disappear after turn 88? Let's see: on turn 84, life span 5; after turn 84, it becomes 4; turn 85, 3; turn 86, 2; turn 87, 1; after turn 87, it disappears, so last chance to eat is on turn 87, when life span is 1.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, if life span is N, it will be gone after turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The state says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span L, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. So after L-1 turns, it disappears.\n> \n> Example: at turn t, life span L. After turn t, L becomes L-1; after turn t+1, L-2; ... after turn t+(L-1), L becomes 0 and it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t+(L-1).\n> \n> Here, turn 84, life span 5, so can be eaten on turns 84,85,86,87. After turn 87, it's gone.\n> \n> Now, head at (2,6), direction L, so moving left. Possible moves: from (2,6), I can go U to (2,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid. D to (2,5)? (2,5) is not in snake positions? Snake positions: (2,6) head, (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), etc. (2,5) is not listed, so should be free, but let's check if it's wall or something.\n> \n> x=2,y=5: borders are walls, but y=7 is wall, y=0 is wall, so y=5 is between 1 and 6, so should be free. Internal walls: (3,2) is wall, but (2,5) is not (3,2), so free.\n> \n> Similarly, L to (1,6): x=1,y=6, x=0 is wall, but x=1 is not border? Border cells: x=0/x=7, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, x=1 to x=6 are playable except internal obstacles. Internal obstacle only at (3,2), so (1,6) should be free.\n> \n> R to (3,6): but (3,6) is the second segment of the snake, so moving right would cause collision with body. Also, since current direction is L, moving R is reverse, which is not allowed? No instant reverse means I cannot move opposite to current direction, so from L, I cannot move R. So R is invalid anyway.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,6):\n> - U: (2,7) - but y=7 is border wall, invalid.\n> - D: (2,5) - let's see if occupied. Snake positions: (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). So (2,5) is not in the list, and not wall, so should be free.\n> - L: (1,6) - x=1,y=6, not border, not obstacle, not in snake positions, so free.\n> - R: (3,6) - which is occupied by body, and also reverse direction, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible moves are D to (2,5) or L to (1,6).\n> \n> Now, I need to think about getting to the food at (5,2). But it's far, at (5,2), head at (2,6), so I need to move down and right, but carefully because of the body and walls.\n> \n> Also, the snake body is long, 17 segments, so it occupies a lot of space. Looking at the positions, it seems the snake is coiled or something. From head (2,6) left to (1,6)? No, moving to (1,6) might be ok, but let's see the path.\n> \n> Perhaps I should consider the safe moves first.\n> \n> Since I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan a path to the food while avoiding dead ends or collisions.\n> \n> First, let's list all occupied cells to avoid.\n> \n> Occupied by snake: all positions in the list: (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\n> \n> Walls: (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x, and (3,2)\n> \n> So free cells: within x=1-6, y=1-6, except snake and (3,2)\n> \n> Specifically, for example, (1,6) is free, (2,5) is free, (3,6) occupied, etc.\n> \n> Now, food at (5,2) with limited time. Life span 5, from turn 84, so must eat by turn 87.\n> \n> Turn 84: can eat if I were there, but I'm at (2,6), too far.\n> \n> I need to get to (5,2) within 4 turns? Turn 84,85,86,87 to eat.\n> \n> But from (2,6) to (5,2), the Manhattan distance is |5-2| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7, so minimum 7 moves, but I can't get there in 4 turns. 7 moves? Each move changes x or y by 1, so distance in moves is |Δx| + |Δy| = 3 + 4 = 7. But I have only 4 turns to move? No.\n> \n> To eat on turn t, I need to be at the food on that turn.\n> \n> So to eat on turn 84, I need to be at (5,2) on turn 84, but I'm at (2,6), impossible.\n> \n> Eat on turn 85: need to be at (5,2) on turn 85, so I have one move on turn 84 to get closer.\n> \n> Similarly, eat on turn 86: two moves, etc.\n> \n> But with 7 moves needed, and only 3 or 4 moves possible before it disappears, I can't reach it directly? Let's see:\n> \n> - After turn 84: I move once, to either (2,5) or (1,6)\n> \n> - Turn 85: I move from there\n> \n> - Turn 86: move\n> \n> - Turn 87: move and possibly eat if at (5,2)\n> \n> - Turn 88: food gone.\n> \n> So I have moves on turns 84,85,86,87 to get to (5,2) for eating on turn 87 at latest.\n> \n> But from (2,6) to (5,2) in 4 moves: min distance 7, impossible to reach in 4 moves. |Δx|=3, |Δy|=4, min moves 7, so in 4 moves, I can cover at most 4 steps, not enough to reach (5,2). So I cannot eat this food; it's too far away.\n> \n> Is that right? |Δx| = |5-2| = 3, |Δy| = |2-6| = 4, so Manhattan distance 7. With 4 moves (turns 84,85,86,87), I can move 4 steps, so I can only reduce the distance by 4, to a point like (3,4) or something, but (5,2) is 7 away, so after 4 moves, distance at least 3, not zero. So indeed, impossible to reach (5,2) before it disappears.\n> \n> Therefore, I should ignore this food and focus on survival and other opportunities, but there are no other foods listed; only one food is given.\n> \n> Food positions: only one, at (5,2).\n> \n> So I need to survive and wait for more food to spawn, I suppose? But the problem doesn't say how food spawns; it only gives current food. I think I have to work with what's given.\n> \n> Perhaps food can spawn later, but not specified. The state only has this one food, so I need to plan based on current state.\n> \n> Since I can't eat this food, I should avoid risks and keep the snake alive for future turns when new food might appear.\n> \n> But for now, I need to move safely.\n> \n> Current head at (2,6), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: D to (2,5) or L to (1,6).\n> \n> Let's evaluate these options.\n> \n> First, move L to (1,6):\n> \n> - (1,6) is free, as per above.\n> \n> - After moving to (1,6), the new head position is (1,6), direction L.\n> \n> - Then the tail moves? When I move, if I don't eat, the tail moves forward. So snake positions will shift: new head at (1,6), then previous head (2,6) becomes body, and so on, tail (5,1) moves off, so new tail is (4,1) or something.\n> \n> Specifically, after moving left to (1,6), the snake becomes: head at (1,6), then body: (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), ... up to (5,1), but since no food eaten, the tail segment is removed, so positions: new head (1,6), then segments 1 to 16: (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) and tail was (5,1), removed, so tail is now (4,1)? Let's list indices.\n> \n> Original positions: index 0: (2,6) head, 1: (3,6), 2: (3,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (5,5), 5: (6,5), 6: (6,4), 7: (5,4), 8: (4,4), 9: (3,4), 10: (2,4), 11: (2,3), 12: (2,2), 13: (2,1), 14: (3,1), 15: (4,1), 16: (5,1) tail.\n> \n> After move L: head moves to (1,6), so new position 0: (1,6). Then the body: segment 1 becomes where head was, (2,6), segment 2 becomes (3,6), and so on, up to segment 16 becomes (5,1), but since no food, we remove the tail, so the new snake has positions: [ (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) ] and tail is (4,1), since (5,1) is gone.\n> \n> Now, after this move, what can I do next? From (1,6), possible moves: U to (1,7) invalid (wall), D to (1,5), L to (0,6) invalid (wall), R to (2,6) but (2,6) is now body segment, and moving right might be reverse?

If head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here tail at (5,1), food at (5,2), so if head were at (5,2), it would be adjacent to tail (5,1), and eating the food would make the snake grow, so new tail at (5,1), and head at (5,2), so they are adjacent, but not colliding yet? Collision when head touches body, but after eating, the tail doesn't move immediately? Let's see the rule.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, if head at (5,2) and tail at (5,1), with food at (5,2), if I move to (5,2) and eat, the snake grows, so the tail remains at (5,1) for this turn, and head at (5,2), so no collision. Then next turn, when I move, the tail moves, so it should be ok, but the rule says it kills.\n> \n> The rule: \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\" After eating, the tail doesn't move, so head at (5,2), tail at (5,1), not colliding. Then when I move next, head moves to new position, and tail moves only if no growth, but with growth, the tail stays, and a new segment is added, so the new tail is the old tail, I think.\n> \n> Let's clarify snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating: head to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment before it, tail is removed.\n> \n> When eating: head moves to food cell, new segment is added at the position where tail was, so tail doesn't move, and the new segment becomes the new tail position, but since it's added where tail was, the tail position is the same as before, but now it's the second last, and the last is the new segment? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard snake: when eating, the head moves to the food, and a new segment is added at the current tail position, so the snake length increases, and the tail remains in place for that turn. Then on next move, if no eat, tail moves.\n> \n> Positions: after move with eat, the head is at new position (food), and the tail segment stays, so the position where tail was is now occupied by the new segment, and the tail is that new segment.\n> \n> For example, positions: ..., A, B, C (tail). Head moves to food F, then new positions: F, A, B, C, and C is still tail? No.\n> \n> Suppose positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> Move to new cell N, if no food, new positions: [N, H, B1, B2, ...] and T removed.\n> \n> If N has food, new positions: [N, H, B1, B2, ..., T] so T is still there, and new segment added at T, so positions become [N, H, B1, B2, ..., T] with T as tail, but T is the same position, so the tail doesn't move, and length increased.\n> \n> In terms of cells, the cell T is still occupied, and N is occupied.\n> \n> Then for Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail, and tail cell has food, meaning that the tail is on a food cell.\n> \n> In this case, tail at (5,1), which has no food; food is at (5,2), different cell.\n> \n> So if head moves to (5,2), it eats the food, grows, new tail at (5,1), same position, head at (5,2), so they are adjacent but not colliding since different cells.\n> \n> Then on next move, if head moves away, it should be fine.\n> \n> But the rule says \"eating it kills the snake\" if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food.\n> \n> Here, tail cell (5,1) has no food, so not an issue.\n> \n> Only if the tail is on a food cell.\n> \n> In this state, tail at (5,1), no food there, so no danger.\n> \n> Back to movement.\n> \n> From (2,6), I have two choices: L to (1,6) or D to (2,5).\n> \n> If I go L to (1,6), then as above, only can go D to (1,5), then from (1,5), I can go D to (1,4), L to (0,4) invalid, R to (2,5), but after moving to (1,6) and then to (1,5), the direction is D, so from (1,5), I can go U, D\n",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State (Turn 85)\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state at Turn 85:\n\n- **Grid**: 8x8 grid with borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacle at (3,2).\n- **Snake**:\n  - Positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1)]\n  - Head at (2,5), direction is Down (D).\n- **Food**:\n  - (5,2): value=1, life_span=4 (will disappear after Turn 88)\n  - (2,5): value=1, life_span=10 (will disappear after Turn 94)\n\n### Immediate Observations\n\n1. **Food at (2,5)**:\n   - The snake's head is currently at (2,5), which is also a food position.\n   - However, the food is under the head, so it can only be eaten if:\n     - The body moves away from (2,5).\n     - The head moves onto (2,5) again.\n   - Currently, the head is already on (2,5), so we cannot eat it immediately.\n\n2. **Food at (5,2)**:\n   - Manhattan distance from head (2,5) to (5,2): |5-2| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6.\n   - Life span is 4 turns (including current turn), so it will disappear after Turn 88.\n   - To eat it by Turn 88, we'd need to reach it in 3 moves (Turns 85, 86, 87), but the minimum distance is 6, which is impossible. Thus, we cannot reach this food in time.\n\n3. **Possible Moves from (2,5)**:\n   - Current direction is Down (D).\n   - Cannot reverse to Up (U) immediately.\n   - Possible moves:\n     - Left (L): (1,5)\n     - Right (R): (3,5)\n     - Down (D): (2,4)\n   - Check each:\n     - (1,5): Not a wall, not occupied by snake (snake has (2,5), (3,5), etc., but not (1,5)).\n     - (3,5): Occupied by snake's body (third segment).\n     - (2,4): Occupied by snake's body (11th segment).\n   - So, only valid move is Left (L) to (1,5).\n\n### Evaluating the Move to (1,5)\n\nIf we move Left to (1,5):\n\n- New head position: (1,5)\n- New direction: Left (L)\n- Snake's new positions: [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1)]\n  - Tail was at (4,1), now removed, new tail is (3,1).\n\nNext possible moves from (1,5), direction L:\n\n- Cannot reverse to Right (R).\n- Possible:\n  - Up (U): (1,6) - Check:\n    - (1,6): Not a wall, not occupied by snake (snake has (2,6), but not (1,6)).\n  - Down (D): (1,4) - Check:\n    - (1,4): Not a wall, not occupied by snake.\n  - Left (L): (0,5) - Wall (x=0), invalid.\n- So, possible moves from (1,5): Up to (1,6) or Down to (1,4).\n\n### Future Planning\n\nGiven that the food at (5,2) is unreachable and the food at (2,5) is under the head (cannot be eaten immediately), the priority is to avoid collisions and stay alive.\n\nMoving Left to (1,5) seems safe and opens up options to move Up or Down next. Moving Down to (1,4) might lead us towards the bottom-left corner, which could be restrictive, whereas moving Up to (1,6) keeps us near the top, potentially more open space.\n\nHowever, from (1,6), possible moves would be:\n- From (1,6), direction would be Up (if we moved U from (1,5)), but (1,7) is a wall.\n- Left to (0,6) is a wall.\n- Down to (1,5) is reverse (direction is U), not allowed.\n- Right to (2,6) is occupied by snake's body.\nSo, moving Up to (1,6) would trap us.\n\nAlternatively, moving Down to (1,4) from (1,5):\n- From (1,4), direction D.\n- Possible moves:\n  - Down to (1,3)\n  - Left to (0,4) - wall\n  - Right to (2,4) - occupied by snake\n- So, only Down to (1,3).\n\nThis path seems to lead us downward along the left wall, which is somewhat safe but may limit future options.\n\n### Alternative Consideration: Is There a Better Initial Move?\n\nFrom (2,5), the only valid move is Left to (1,5). Other moves lead to collisions or are invalid due to direction reversal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the constraints, the only immediate safe move is Left to (1,5). Subsequent moves will need to navigate carefully to avoid getting trapped.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAt Turn 85, the only valid and safe move is Left (L).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

It's turn 84, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and food.\n> \n> **Grid Setup:**\n> - Walls: Border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, an internal obstacle at (3,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but borders are walls, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6) except for the obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> **Snake Positions:**\n> - Snake body: [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)]\n> - Head is at (2,6), and direction is L (left). Since the head is at (2,6) and moving left, that means it came from the right, so previous position was (3,6), which is the second segment.\n> \n> **Food:**\n> - There's one food item at (5,2) with value 1 and life span 5. Life span decreases every turn, including current, so after turn 84, it will have 4 turns left, then 3, and so on until it disappears.\n> \n> **Movement Constraints:**\n> - I can move U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> - No instant reverse: Since current direction is L, I cannot move R on the next turn. So possible moves from (2,6) are U, D, or L, but not R.\n> \n> **Deadly Collisions:**\n> - Collision with body or wall kills the snake. But I can move into the tail cell if it's moving away, because the tail moves forward when the snake eats or not.\n> \n> **Food Mechanics:**\n> - Positive food: +1 score, snake length +1.\n> - Negative food: -1 score, length unchanged. But in this case, the food at (5,2) has value 1, so it's positive food.\n> - Life-span: Disappears after N turns; here, life span 5, starting from turn 84.\n> - Food under body: Can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it. But here, food is at (5,2), which is not under the snake body currently. Let's check the snake positions: (2,1) to (5,1) are at y=1, (2,2) at y=2, but (5,2) is not in the list, so it's free. Snake has segments from (2,1) to (5,1) at bottom, then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), etc. up to head at (2,6). So (5,2) is not occupied by snake.\n> - Tail Reward Danger: If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide. But tail is at (5,1), since positions: head (2,6), then body, tail is last, (5,1). Food is at (5,2), which is above the tail? (5,1) is tail, (5,2) is directly above it.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,1), food at (5,2). If the head were to move to (5,2), but head is at (2,6), far away. So not an immediate concern.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's visualize the grid. I'll sketch a rough map.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and (3,2).\n> \n> Playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (3,2) is wall.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> - Head: (2,6)\n> - Body: (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)  // that's 17 segments, including head? List has 17 positions: indices 0 to 16, head at 0, tail at 16 which is (5,1).\n> \n> So snake length is 17.\n> \n> Food at (5,2), value 1, life span 5 turns including current, so it will disappear after turn 88? Let's see: on turn 84, life span 5; after turn 84, it becomes 4; turn 85, 3; turn 86, 2; turn 87, 1; after turn 87, it disappears, so last chance to eat is on turn 87, when life span is 1.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, if life span is N, it will be gone after turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The state says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span L, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. So after L-1 turns, it disappears.\n> \n> Example: at turn t, life span L. After turn t, L becomes L-1; after turn t+1, L-2; ... after turn t+(L-1), L becomes 0 and it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t+(L-1).\n> \n> Here, turn 84, life span 5, so can be eaten on turns 84,85,86,87. After turn 87, it's gone.\n> \n> Now, head at (2,6), direction L, so moving left. Possible moves: from (2,6), I can go U to (2,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid. D to (2,5)? (2,5) is not in snake positions? Snake positions: (2,6) head, (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), etc. (2,5) is not listed, so should be free, but let's check if it's wall or something.\n> \n> x=2,y=5: borders are walls, but y=7 is wall, y=0 is wall, so y=5 is between 1 and 6, so should be free. Internal walls: (3,2) is wall, but (2,5) is not (3,2), so free.\n> \n> Similarly, L to (1,6): x=1,y=6, x=0 is wall, but x=1 is not border? Border cells: x=0/x=7, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, x=1 to x=6 are playable except internal obstacles. Internal obstacle only at (3,2), so (1,6) should be free.\n> \n> R to (3,6): but (3,6) is the second segment of the snake, so moving right would cause collision with body. Also, since current direction is L, moving R is reverse, which is not allowed? No instant reverse means I cannot move opposite to current direction, so from L, I cannot move R. So R is invalid anyway.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,6):\n> - U: (2,7) - but y=7 is border wall, invalid.\n> - D: (2,5) - let's see if occupied. Snake positions: (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). So (2,5) is not in the list, and not wall, so should be free.\n> - L: (1,6) - x=1,y=6, not border, not obstacle, not in snake positions, so free.\n> - R: (3,6) - which is occupied by body, and also reverse direction, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible moves are D to (2,5) or L to (1,6).\n> \n> Now, I need to think about getting to the food at (5,2). But it's far, at (5,2), head at (2,6), so I need to move down and right, but carefully because of the body and walls.\n> \n> Also, the snake body is long, 17 segments, so it occupies a lot of space. Looking at the positions, it seems the snake is coiled or something. From head (2,6) left to (1,6)? No, moving to (1,6) might be ok, but let's see the path.\n> \n> Perhaps I should consider the safe moves first.\n> \n> Since I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan a path to the food while avoiding dead ends or collisions.\n> \n> First, let's list all occupied cells to avoid.\n> \n> Occupied by snake: all positions in the list: (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\n> \n> Walls: (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x, and (3,2)\n> \n> So free cells: within x=1-6, y=1-6, except snake and (3,2)\n> \n> Specifically, for example, (1,6) is free, (2,5) is free, (3,6) occupied, etc.\n> \n> Now, food at (5,2) with limited time. Life span 5, from turn 84, so must eat by turn 87.\n> \n> Turn 84: can eat if I were there, but I'm at (2,6), too far.\n> \n> I need to get to (5,2) within 4 turns? Turn 84,85,86,87 to eat.\n> \n> But from (2,6) to (5,2), the Manhattan distance is |5-2| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7, so minimum 7 moves, but I can't get there in 4 turns. 7 moves? Each move changes x or y by 1, so distance in moves is |Δx| + |Δy| = 3 + 4 = 7. But I have only 4 turns to move? No.\n> \n> To eat on turn t, I need to be at the food on that turn.\n> \n> So to eat on turn 84, I need to be at (5,2) on turn 84, but I'm at (2,6), impossible.\n> \n> Eat on turn 85: need to be at (5,2) on turn 85, so I have one move on turn 84 to get closer.\n> \n> Similarly, eat on turn 86: two moves, etc.\n> \n> But with 7 moves needed, and only 3 or 4 moves possible before it disappears, I can't reach it directly?

So I cannot eat this food; it's too far away.\n> \n> Is that right? |Δx| = |5-2| = 3, |Δy| = |2-6| = 4, so Manhattan distance 7. With 4 moves (turns 84,85,86,87), I can move 4 steps, so I can only reduce the distance by 4, to a point like (3,4) or something, but (5,2) is 7 away, so after 4 moves, distance at least 3, not zero. So indeed, impossible to reach (5,2) before it disappears.\n> \n> Therefore, I should ignore this food and focus on survival and other opportunities, but there are no other foods listed; only one food is given.\n> \n> Food positions: only one, at (5,2).\n> \n> So I need to survive and wait for more food to spawn, I suppose? But the problem doesn't say how food spawns; it only gives current food. I think I have to work with what's given.\n> \n> Perhaps food can spawn later, but not specified. The state only has this one food, so I need to plan based on current state.\n> \n> Since I can't eat this food, I should avoid risks and keep the snake alive for future turns when new food might appear.\n> \n> But for now, I need to move safely.\n> \n> Current head at (2,6), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: D to (2,5) or L to (1,6).\n> \n> Let's evaluate these options.\n> \n> First, move L to (1,6):\n> \n> - (1,6) is free, as per above.\n> \n> - After moving to (1,6), the new head position is (1,6), direction L.\n> \n> - Then the tail moves? When I move, if I don't eat, the tail moves forward. So snake positions will shift: new head at (1,6), then previous head (2,6) becomes body, and so on, tail (5,1) moves off, so new tail is (4,1) or something.\n> \n> Specifically, after moving left to (1,6), the snake becomes: head at (1,6), then body: (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), ... up to (5,1), but since no food eaten, the tail segment is removed, so positions: new head (1,6), then segments 1 to 16: (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) and tail was (5,1), removed, so tail is now (4,1)? Let's list indices.\n> \n> Original positions: index 0: (2,6) head, 1: (3,6), 2: (3,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (5,5), 5: (6,5), 6: (6,4), 7: (5,4), 8: (4,4), 9: (3,4), 10: (2,4), 11: (2,3), 12: (2,2), 13: (2,1), 14: (3,1), 15: (4,1), 16: (5,1) tail.\n> \n> After move L: head moves to (1,6), so new position 0: (1,6). Then the body: segment 1 becomes where head was, (2,6), segment 2 becomes (3,6), and so on, up to segment 16 becomes (5,1), but since no food, we remove the tail, so the new snake has positions: [ (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) ] and tail is (4,1), since (5,1) is gone.\n> \n> Now, after this move, what can I do next? From (1,6), possible moves: U to (1,7) invalid (wall), D to (1,5), L to (0,6) invalid (wall), R to (2,6) but (2,6) is now body segment, and moving right might be reverse? Direction: after moving left to (1,6), direction is L, so moving R to (2,6) is opposite, not allowed. So only possible move from (1,6) is D to (1,5), assuming (1,5) is free.\n> \n> (1,5): x=1,y=5, not border, not wall, not in new snake positions? New positions: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), etc. (1,5) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> But after moving to (1,6), I can only go down to (1,5), then from there, I might go to (1,4), etc., but I'm going down the left side.\n> \n> Now, the area around (1,5) and below: (1,4), (1,3), etc., but there is wall at (3,2), and snake body below.\n> \n> This might lead to a dead end if I'm not careful.\n> \n> Now, other option: move D from (2,6) to (2,5).\n> \n> (2,5) is free, as per earlier.\n> \n> After moving down to (2,5), new head at (2,5), direction D (since I moved down).\n> \n> Then snake positions: head (2,5), then (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) and tail (5,1) removed, so tail at (4,1).\n> \n> Now from (2,5), possible moves: U to (2,6) but (2,6) is now body, and moving up would be reverse? Direction is D (down), so moving U is opposite, not allowed. L to (1,5), R to (3,5), or D to (2,4).\n> \n> (3,5) is occupied by body? In new positions, (3,5) is segment 3? Positions: [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), ... ] so (3,5) is segment 3, occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) is segment 11? [head (2,5), then (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), ...] so (2,4) is segment 11, occupied.\n> \n> (1,5) is free.\n> \n> So from (2,5), possible moves: L to (1,5) or D to (2,4) but (2,4) occupied, so only L to (1,5)? D to (2,4) is occupied, so invalid. R to (3,5) occupied. U invalid as reverse. So only L to (1,5).\n> \n> Then from (1,5), similar to before.\n> \n> In both cases, moving L or D from (2,6) leads me to the left side, and I might be trapped.\n> \n> But let's see the grid better.\n> \n> I should think about the space available.\n> \n> The snake occupies many cells: let's list all occupied cells to see free areas.\n> \n> Occupied: (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\n> \n> Walls: all borders and (3,2)\n> \n> Free cells: for example, (1,1) to (1,6) except (1,1) might be free? (1,1): x=1,y=1, not border, not obstacle, not in snake positions. Snake has (2,1), (3,1), etc., but not (1,1), so (1,1) free. Similarly, (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) all free except (1,6) might be occupied after move, but initially free.\n> \n> (1,6) free now.\n> \n> Also, (3,3): not occupied, not wall? (3,2) is wall, (3,3) is x=3,y=3, should be free. Snake has (3,4), (3,5), etc., but not (3,3).\n> \n> (4,3): free?

If head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here tail at (5,1), food at (5,2), so if head were at (5,2), it would be adjacent to tail (5,1), and eating the food would make the snake grow, so new tail at (5,1), and head at (5,2), so they are adjacent, but not colliding yet? Collision when head touches body, but after eating, the tail doesn't move immediately? Let's see the rule.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, if head at (5,2) and tail at (5,1), with food at (5,2), if I move to (5,2) and eat, the snake grows, so the tail remains at (5,1) for this turn, and head at (5,2), so no collision. Then next turn, when I move, the tail moves, so it should be ok, but the rule says it kills.\n> \n> The rule: \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\" After eating, the tail doesn't move, so head at (5,2), tail at (5,1), not colliding. Then when I move next, head moves to new position, and tail moves only if no growth, but with growth, the tail stays, and a new segment is added, so the new tail is the old tail, I think.\n> \n> Let's clarify snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating: head to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment before it, tail is removed.\n> \n> When eating: head moves to food cell, new segment is added at the position where tail was, so tail doesn't move, and the new segment becomes the new tail position, but since it's added where tail was, the tail position is the same as before, but now it's the second last, and the last is the new segment? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard snake: when eating, the head moves to the food, and a new segment is added at the current tail position, so the snake length increases, and the tail remains in place for that turn. Then on next move, if no eat, tail moves.\n> \n> Positions: after move with eat, the head is at new position (food), and the tail segment stays, so the position where tail was is now occupied by the new segment, and the tail is that new segment.\n> \n> For example, positions: ..., A, B, C (tail). Head moves to food F, then new positions: F, A, B, C, and C is still tail? No.\n> \n> Suppose positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> Move to new cell N, if no food, new positions: [N, H, B1, B2, ...] and T removed.\n> \n> If N has food, new positions: [N, H, B1, B2, ..., T] so T is still there, and new segment added at T, so positions become [N, H, B1, B2, ..., T] with T as tail, but T is the same position, so the tail doesn't move, and length increased.\n> \n> In terms of cells, the cell T is still occupied, and N is occupied.\n> \n> Then for Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail, and tail cell has food, meaning that the tail is on a food cell.\n> \n> In this case, tail at (5,1), which has no food; food is at (5,2), different cell.\n> \n> So if head moves to (5,2), it eats the food, grows, new tail at (5,1), same position, head at (5,2), so they are adjacent but not colliding since different cells.\n> \n> Then on next move, if head moves away, it should be fine.\n> \n> But the rule says \"eating it kills the snake\" if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food.\n> \n> Here, tail cell (5,1) has no food, so not an issue.\n> \n> Only if the tail is on a food cell.\n> \n> In this state, tail at (5,1), no food there, so no danger.\n> \n> Back to movement.\n> \n> From (2,6), I have two choices: L to (1,6) or D to (2,5).\n> \n> If I go L to (1,6), then as above, only can go D to (1,5), then from (1,5), I can go D to (1,4), L to (0,4) invalid, R to (2,5), but after moving to (1,6) and then to (1,5), the direction is D, so from (1,5), I can go U, D, L, R, but U to (1,6) is body, and reverse?

There's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n- **Snake**:\n  - Positions (head first): [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)]\n  - Head at (1,3), direction D (down).\n- **Food**:\n  - (5,2): value=1, life_span=1\n  - (2,5): value=7, life_span=1\n  - (5,3): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's head is at (1,3), moving down (D). The possible moves from here are:\n\n1. **Down (D)**: to (1,2)\n   - Check if (1,2) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: y=2 is within playable area (y=1 to y=6).\n     - Not occupied by snake: (1,2) is not in the snake's positions.\n     - No immediate collision.\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: to (0,3)\n   - x=0 is a wall. Invalid move.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: to (2,3)\n   - Check (2,3):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Occupied by snake: (2,3) is the 15th segment in the list (index 15).\n     - Moving here would cause a collision with the body. Invalid move.\n\n4. **Up (U)**: to (1,4)\n   - Current direction is D, moving U is the opposite. \"No instant reverse\" rule applies. Invalid move.\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nAll food has a life_span of 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten. \n\n- **Food at (5,2), (2,5), (5,3)**:\n  - Distance from head (1,3):\n    - (5,2): Manhattan distance = |5-1| + |2-3| = 4 + 1 = 5\n    - (2,5): |2-1| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n    - (5,3): |5-1| + |3-3| = 4 + 0 = 4\n  - Cannot reach any food in one move. All food will disappear after this turn regardless.\n\n### Decision for Turn 88\n\nGiven the above analysis, the only valid and safe move is **Down (D)** to (1,2).\n\n### Verifying Future Moves (Optional but Good Practice)\n\nAfter moving to (1,2), the snake's new state would be:\n\n- **Head**: (1,2), direction D.\n- **Body**: (1,3), (1,4), ..., (2,3) (tail moves from (2,2) to (2,3)).\n\nPossible moves from (1,2), direction D:\n\n1. **Down (D)**: to (1,1)\n   - Valid: (1,1) is within bounds and not occupied.\n2. **Right (R)**: to (2,2)\n   - Valid: (2,2) is now free (tail was at (2,2) but moved to (2,3)).\n3. **Left (L)**: to (0,2) - wall. Invalid.\n4. **Up (U)**: opposite direction. Invalid.\n\nBoth D and R are valid, providing flexibility for future turns.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only immediate safe and valid move at Turn 88 is **Down (D)**.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

It's turn 88, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (1,3) and moving down. The full snake body is: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)]. Let me list these positions to visualize the snake.\n> \n> Starting from head: (1,3) down to (1,4), (1,5), then right to (2,5), up to (2,6)? (2,6) is above (2,5) since y increases up? No, in grid coordinates, typically y=0 is bottom or top? The movement says U is (x,y+1), so if U increases y, then y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. So moving U increases y, moving D decreases y.\n> \n> In the snake positions, (1,3) to (1,4) to (1,5): since head is at (1,3) and moving down? Head direction is D, down, which is (x,y-1), so decreasing y.\n> \n> But from (1,3) to (1,4): if moving down, from (1,3) to (1,2) would be down, but here it's (1,3) to (1,4), which is up? Inconsistency.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), ...] so the head is (1,3), and the next segment is (1,4), which is above it, so if head was at (1,4) and moved down to (1,3), but positions are listed head first, so the snake was moving up before, I think.\n> \n> Head direction is given as D, down, for the current state. So at turn 88, head is at (1,3) and direction is D, meaning it just moved to (1,3) by going down? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: (1,3) head, index 1: (1,4), index 2: (1,5), etc. Since positions are head first, the body follows, so the head is at (1,3), and the segment behind it is (1,4), which means the snake was previously at (1,4) and moved down to (1,3), so direction D is consistent with moving from (1,4) to (1,3). Similarly, before that, it was at (1,5) and moved down to (1,4), and so on.\n> \n> But let's list all positions:\n> \n> - Head: (1,3)\n> \n> - Then (1,4)  // directly below? y=4 is higher than y=3? Since y increases up, (1,4) is north of (1,3).\n> \n> Since head is at (1,3) and direction is D (down, decreasing y), that means it came from (1,4) to (1,3) by moving down.\n> \n> Similarly, the tail is at (2,2), I think.\n> \n> Full list: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)\n> \n> So from head to tail: starts at (1,3), then to (1,4), (1,5), then to (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)\n> \n> Now, the snake is long: 17 segments.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (5,2) with value 1, life_span 1\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 7, life_span 1? Value 7? But food values are +1 or -1, I think. In the core rules, positive food is +1, negative is -1, but here it says value 1, 7, 10? That can't be right.\n> \n> Look: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (5, 2, 1, 1) - (2, 5, 7, 1) - (5, 3, 10, 1)\"\n> \n> In the input, it's (x,y, value, life_span)\n> \n> So for (5,2): x=5,y=2, value=1, life_span=1\n> \n> (2,5): x=2,y=5, value=7, life_span=1? Value 7? But core rules say food value is +1 or -1, but here it's 1,7,10. That seems odd. Perhaps I misread.\n> \n> Core rules: \"Positive Food: Reward Value = +1\", \"Negative Food: Penalty Value = -1\", but in the state, it has values like 1,7,10. That must be a mistake or I'm misunderstanding.\n> \n> Perhaps the value is the reward, but core rules say it should be +1 or -1, but here it's given as numbers. Let me check the state input format.\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\"\n> \n> And in this case, it's (5,2,1,1) so value=1, life_span=1\n> \n> (2,5,7,1) value=7, life_span=1\n> \n> (5,3,10,1) value=10, life_span=1\n> \n> But core rules say positive food is +1, negative is -1, so why values like 7 and 10? That doesn't make sense. Perhaps for this game, food can have different values, but the core rules only mention +1 and -1.\n> \n> I think I should go with the state given; maybe in this variant, food can have different values. But the core rules don't specify that. Let me read the core rules again.\n> \n> \"Core Rules: 1. Food Mechanics - Positive Food: Reward Value = +1 - Negative Food: Penalty Value = -1\"\n> \n> But in the state, values are 1,7,10. 1 is +1, but 7 and 10 are larger. Perhaps it's a mistake, or perhaps \"value\" here is the life span or something? No, it says \"Value and Life Span\", and in the tuple, it's (x,y, value, life_span).\n> \n> For (5,2,1,1): value=1, life_span=1\n> \n> (2,5,7,1): value=7, life_span=1\n> \n> (5,3,10,1): value=10, life_span=1\n> \n> But core rules say only +1 or -1, so maybe for this game, positive food can have different values? But the rules don't say that. Perhaps I should assume that value is the reward, so (5,2) is +1, (2,5) is +7, (5,3) is +10, all positive, no negative food here.\n> \n> But the rules mention negative food, but in this state, all food has positive values, so no negative food.\n> \n> Also, life_span: all have life_span 1, meaning they disappear after this turn if not eaten? Life_span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Life_span=1 means it will disappear after this turn, so if not eaten on turn 88, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> (2,5) has value 7, life_span 1? Life_span 1, so after turn 88, it disappears if not eaten.\n> \n> But turn 88 is current turn, so on turn 88, if head moves to food, it can eat it.\n> \n> Life_span N: on the turn it spawns, life_span N, then each turn it decreases, and when life_span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or something? Need to clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for a food with life_span N, on the turn it is presented, countdown is N, then at the end of that turn, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until countdown 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> If life_span=1, on turn t, countdown=1, at the end of turn t, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so it can only be eaten on turn t if the head moves to it during turn t.\n> \n> Similarly, for life_span=k, it can be eaten on turns when countdown >0.\n> \n> In this case, all food has life_span=1, so they must be eaten on this turn (88) or they disappear.\n> \n> (5,2,1,1), (2,5,7,1), (5,3,10,1) all life_span=1, so only available on turn 88.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (1,3), direction D (down).\n> \n> Possible moves: from current direction D, I can move L, R, or D, but not U because reverse is not allowed.

Let's check: positions have (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), ... down to (2,2), no (1,2), so (1,2) should be free, but walls: y=0 is wall, so (1,2) is playable.\n> \n> But internal obstacle at (3,2), not (1,2).\n> \n> Also, (1,2) is not wall, not snake, so can move there.\n> \n> - L: left to (0,3) - but x=0 is wall, so cannot move left.\n> \n> x=0 is wall, so from (1,3), left to (0,3) is invalid.\n> \n> - R: right to (2,3) - (2,3) is occupied by snake?

It's turn 88, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (1,3) and moving down. The full snake body is: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)]. Let me list these positions to visualize the snake.\n> \n> Starting from head: (1,3) down to (1,4), (1,5), then right to (2,5), up to (2,6)? (2,6) is above (2,5) since y increases up? No, in grid coordinates, typically y=0 is bottom or top? The movement says U is (x,y+1), so if U increases y, then y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. So moving U increases y, moving D decreases y.\n> \n> In the snake positions, (1,3) to (1,4) to (1,5): since head is at (1,3) and moving down? Head direction is D, down, which is (x,y-1), so decreasing y.\n> \n> But from (1,3) to (1,4): if moving down, from (1,3) to (1,2) would be down, but here it's (1,3) to (1,4), which is up? Inconsistency.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), ...] so the head is (1,3), and the next segment is (1,4), which is above it, so if head was at (1,4) and moved down to (1,3), but positions are listed head first, so the snake was moving up before, I think.\n> \n> Head direction is given as D, down, for the current state. So at turn 88, head is at (1,3) and direction is D, meaning it just moved to (1,3) by going down? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: (1,3) head, index 1: (1,4), index 2: (1,5), etc. Since positions are head first, the body follows, so the head is at (1,3), and the segment behind it is (1,4), which means the snake was previously at (1,4) and moved down to (1,3), so direction D is consistent with moving from (1,4) to (1,3). Similarly, before that, it was at (1,5) and moved down to (1,4), and so on.\n> \n> But let's list all positions:\n> \n> - Head: (1,3)\n> \n> - Then (1,4)  // directly below? y=4 is higher than y=3? Since y increases up, (1,4) is north of (1,3).\n> \n> Since head is at (1,3) and direction is D (down, decreasing y), that means it came from (1,4) to (1,3) by moving down.\n> \n> Similarly, the tail is at (2,2), I think.\n> \n> Full list: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)\n> \n> So from head to tail: starts at (1,3), then to (1,4), (1,5), then to (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)\n> \n> Now, the snake is long: 17 segments.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (5,2) with value 1, life_span 1\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 7, life_span 1?

Food Mechanics - Positive Food: Reward Value = +1 - Negative Food: Penalty Value = -1\"\n> \n> But in the state, values are 1,7,10. 1 is +1, but 7 and 10 are larger. Perhaps it's a mistake, or perhaps \"value\" here is the life span or something? No, it says \"Value and Life Span\", and in the tuple, it's (x,y, value, life_span).\n> \n> For (5,2,1,1): value=1, life_span=1\n> \n> (2,5,7,1): value=7, life_span=1\n> \n> (5,3,10,1): value=10, life_span=1\n> \n> But core rules say only +1 or -1, so maybe for this game, positive food can have different values?

Move U to (2, 3) at Turn 90.\n  2. Move R to (3, 3) at Turn 91.\n  3. Move R to (4, 3) at Turn 92.\n  4. Move R to (5, 3) at Turn 93 to eat the food.\n- This path avoids collisions and walls.\n\n### Why Not Move D (Down) at Turn 90?\n- Moving D to (2, 1) at Turn 90 would take the snake further away from both food items, making it harder to reach (5, 3) in time.\n- It also doesn't help free the food at (2, 5) any faster.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe best immediate move is **U (Up)** to (2, 3) to start navigating toward the free food at (5, 3). \n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{U}",

But let's check if it's occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,3), etc. List all positions to see what's occupied.\n> \n> Snake segments:\n> \n> 1. (2,2) head\n> \n> 2. (1,2)\n> \n> 3. (1,3)\n> \n> 4. (1,4)\n> \n> 5. (1,5)\n> \n> 6. (2,5)\n> \n> 7. (2,6)\n> \n> 8. (3,6)\n> \n> 9. (3,5)\n> \n> 10. (4,5)\n> \n> 11. (5,5)\n> \n> 12. (6,5)\n> \n> 13. (6,4)\n> \n> 14. (5,4)\n> \n> 15. (4,4)\n> \n> 16. (3,4)\n> \n> 17. (2,4)\n> \n> (2,4) is the tail, I think. Positions are given head first, so (2,4) is the last segment.\n> \n> Now, (2,1): is it occupied? From the list, no: (2,2) is head, then (1,2), etc. (2,1) not listed, so free, but is it a wall? No, walls are only borders and (3,2). So (2,1) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,3): is it occupied? Positions: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), ... (2,4) is at (2,4), (3,4), etc. (2,3) not in list, so free.\n> \n> (3,2) is wall, so not possible.\n> \n> So from head (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3) or D to (2,1).\n> \n> Now, food at (2,5) and (5,3).\n> \n> (2,5) is a food position, but (2,5) is also occupied by snake body? Snake positions: index 6 is (2,5), which is a body segment.\n> \n> (2,5) is the 6th segment, so it's part of the snake body.\n> \n> But food is at (2,5) with value 1.\n> \n> Special case: food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, (2,5) has food and is occupied by snake body. So to eat it, the snake body must move away from (2,5), and then head must move there.\n> \n> But the head is at (2,2), which is not adjacent to (2,5) directly; it's a few cells away.\n> \n> Adjacent means one cell away horizontally or vertically.\n> \n> From (2,2) to (2,5), it's 3 cells away in y-direction, not adjacent.\n> \n> Similarly, other food at (5,3).\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for multiple turns. Since I need to output an action sequence starting from turn 90.\n> \n> The answer should include actions for turn 90, turn 91, etc., but I don't know how many to plan.

The segment at (2,5) will move when the snake moves.\n> \n> Current head at (2,2), direction R.\n> \n> If I move U to (2,3), then new head position (2,3), and the tail will move? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, and the tail shifts, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> Snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, a new segment is added only if food is eaten; otherwise, the tail segment is removed, so the snake moves forward.\n> \n> In this case, no food eaten yet, so when head moves, tail is removed.\n> \n> Current tail is at (2,4)? Positions: last is (2,4), but let's see the list: after head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4). Yes, (2,4) is the tail.\n> \n> If head moves to (2,3), then new head is (2,3), and the tail (2,4) is removed? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a new cell, that becomes the new head, and the previous head becomes part of the body. Then, if no food eaten, the tail cell is vacated, so the snake shortens temporarily? No.\n> \n> In snake game, when the snake moves, it advances: the head moves to a new cell, and the tail is removed if no food eaten. So the length stays the same unless food is eaten.\n> \n> But here, when no food eaten, the tail segment is removed, so the snake moves to the new position without growing.\n> \n> Similarly, if food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> In this state, for turn 90, head at (2,2), I choose a direction.\n> \n> Say I move U to (2,3). Then:\n> \n> - New head: (2,3)\n> \n> - Body segments: the previous head (2,2) becomes the first body segment, then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), and tail (2,4) is removed because no food eaten. So the snake now has head at (2,3), then body: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4). And (2,4) is gone.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move D to (2,1), new head (2,1), body (2,2), (1,2), etc., tail removed.\n> \n> Now, food at (2,5): it is currently occupied by a body segment. When the snake moves, if that segment moves away, the food might become accessible.\n> \n> For example, if in some move, the body moves from (2,5), then (2,5) is free, and if head moves there, it can eat the food.\n> \n> But in the current move, head is at (2,2), not near (2,5).\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,3) is free, I think. Let's see if (5,3) is occupied.\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), etc., no (5,3), so (5,3) is free and has food.\n> \n> (5,3) is a valid cell, no wall, so I can go there to eat it.\n> \n> But it's at (5,3), head at (2,2), so I need to navigate there.\n> \n> First, let's consider the two possible moves for turn 90: U or D.\n> \n> Also, I need to think about risks. For example, moving U to (2,3): what is around there?\n> \n> (2,3) is adjacent to (2,2) which will be body, (2,4) which is currently tail but will be removed or something?

After removing (2,4), the new tail is (3,4)? Positions: the last segment was (2,4), removed, so the new last is (3,4), which was second last.\n> \n> From the list, after removal, segments: 1. head (2,3), 2. (2,2), 3. (1,2), 4. (1,3), 5.

Let's count.\n> \n> Original 17 segments: indices 1 to 17.\n> \n> After move: new head at (2,3), which is new position, so the body has the old head (2,2) as first body, then the next 15 segments from old body except the tail is removed. Old segments: positions 2 to 17: (1,2) to (2,4).\n> \n> When head moves to new cell, the new body is: [previous head] + [all body segments except the last one if no food eaten].\n> \n> Standard: the snake moves, so the new head is at new position, the new body consists of the previous head position followed by all previous body positions except the tail is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> So here, previous head (2,2) becomes new first body segment.\n> \n> Previous body segments: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), and the tail (2,4) is removed.\n> \n> So new snake: head (2,3), body: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), and (3,4) is the last body segment, so tail at (3,4).\n> \n> Number of segments: 16, since no growth.\n> \n> Now, food at (2,5) is still there, but it's occupied by body segment at index 7: (2,5).\n> \n> For it to be eaten, the body must move away, meaning that segment moves to another cell, so (2,5) is free, then head moves there.\n> \n> But currently, head is at (2,3), so not adjacent.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,3) is free.\n> \n> Life span: (2,5) has life span 6, so from turn 90, it will disappear after 6 turns, so available on turns 90,91,92,93,94,95, gone on turn 96.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) life span 8, available turns 90 to 97, gone 98.\n> \n> Turn 90 is current, so it decreases each turn including current, so after turn 90, life span decreases to 5 for (2,5), etc.\n> \n> For food at (2,5), it can be eaten only if the body moves away from it.\n> \n> The body segment at (2,5) will move when the snake moves.

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State (Turn 91)\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state at Turn 91 based on the provided information:\n\n- **Grid Dimensions**: 8x8 grid (x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7), with borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 being walls. There's also an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n  \n- **Snake**:\n  - **Positions**: [(2, 3), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4)]\n    - Head at (2,3), tail at (3,4).\n  - **Direction**: The head is currently moving **Up (U)** (since the previous action at Turn 90 was U).\n\n- **Food**:\n  - (2, 5): Value = +1, Life Span = 5 (since it was 6 at Turn 90, and countdown includes current turn).\n  - (5, 3): Value = +1, Life Span = 7.\n  - (5, 1): Value = +1, Life Span = 10.\n\n### Previous Plan from Turn 90\n\nFrom the Thinking Model's output at Turn 90, the plan was:\n1. **Turn 90**: Move U to (2,3).\n2. **Turn 91**: Move R to (3,3).\n3. **Turn 92**: Move R to (4,3).\n4. **Turn 93**: Move R to (5,3) to eat the food there.\n5. **Turn 94**: Move R to (6,3).\n\nThis plan prioritizes reaching the food at (5,3) due to its longer life span and safety, avoiding the risky food at (2,5) which is under the snake's body.\n\n### Current Task at Turn 91\n\nAt Turn 91, the snake is at (2,3), having just moved U from (2,2). The next action according to the plan is to move R to (3,3). \n\nBut before executing, let's verify if this move is safe and optimal given the current state.\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 91\n\nFrom (2,3), with current direction U, the possible moves are:\n- **U (Up)**: (2,4)\n- **D (Down)**: (2,2) - This is the body segment (2,2), so moving here would cause a collision.\n- **L (Left)**: (1,3) - This is the body segment (1,3), so moving here would cause a collision.\n- **R (Right)**: (3,3)\n\nGiven the no instant reverse rule, we cannot move D (opposite of U), but even if we could, (2,2) is occupied. Similarly, L leads to a body segment. \n\nThus, the only safe moves are:\n- **U to (2,4)**\n- **R to (3,3)**\n\n### Evaluating U to (2,4)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (2,4)\n- **Body Segments**: The current body is [(2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)].\n  - Moving U to (2,4) would make the new body: [(2,3), (2,2), (1,2), ..., (4,4)], removing the tail (3,4).\n- **Adjacent Cells After Move**:\n  - From (2,4), possible next moves would be U to (2,5) (body segment), D to (2,3) (body segment), L to (1,4) (body segment), R to (3,4) (tail is removed, so free).\n  - Only R to (3,4) is safe next move.\n\nThis path seems to continue moving right, aligning with the plan to reach (5,3).\n\n### Evaluating R to (3,3)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (3,3)\n- **Body Segments**: New body would be [(2,3), (2,2), (1,2), ..., (4,4)], removing the tail (3,4).\n- **Adjacent Cells After Move**:\n  - From (3,3), possible next moves: U to (3,4) (free), D to (3,2) (wall), L to (2,3) (body), R to (4,3).\n  - Safe moves: U to (3,4), R to (4,3).\n\nThis also aligns with moving towards (5,3).\n\n### Comparing U and R Moves\n\n- **Moving U to (2,4)**:\n  - Next move would likely be R to (3,4), then R to (4,4), etc., which is less direct towards (5,3).\n  \n- **Moving R to (3,3)**:\n  - Next moves can be R to (4,3), then R to (5,3), directly reaching the food in two more turns.\n\nThus, **R to (3,3)** is more efficient for reaching (5,3).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\n- **Food at (2,5)**: Currently under the body segment (2,5). To eat it:\n  - The body must move away from (2,5), then the head must move onto it.\n  - Currently, the head is at (2,3), not adjacent to (2,5).\n  - Even if we move in a way to free (2,5), it's unlikely to be reachable before its life span ends (by Turn 95).\n\n- **Food at (5,3)**: Free and reachable in 3 moves (R to (3,3), R to (4,3), R to (5,3)).\n\nThus, prioritizing (5,3) is better.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- **Collision**: Moving R to (3,3) is safe as (3,3) is not a wall or body segment.\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: The tail is at (3,4), and food is at (2,5) and (5,3). Neither is adjacent to the tail in a way that would cause this danger.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFollowing the previous plan's guidance is optimal. The immediate action at Turn 91 should be to move **Right (R)** to (3,3), continuing the path towards the food at (5,3).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

The segment at (2,5) will move when the snake moves.\n> \n> Current head at (2,2), direction R.\n> \n> If I move U to (2,3), then new head position (2,3), and the tail will move? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, and the tail shifts, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> Snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, a new segment is added only if food is eaten; otherwise, the tail segment is removed, so the snake moves forward.\n> \n> In this case, no food eaten yet, so when head moves, tail is removed.\n> \n> Current tail is at (2,4)? Positions: last is (2,4), but let's see the list: after head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4). Yes, (2,4) is the tail.\n> \n> If head moves to (2,3), then new head is (2,3), and the tail (2,4) is removed? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a new cell, that becomes the new head, and the previous head becomes part of the body. Then, if no food eaten, the tail cell is vacated, so the snake shortens temporarily? No.\n> \n> In snake game, when the snake moves, it advances: the head moves to a new cell, and the tail is removed if no food eaten. So the length stays the same unless food is eaten.\n> \n> But here, when no food eaten, the tail segment is removed, so the snake moves to the new position without growing.\n> \n> Similarly, if food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> In this state, for turn 90, head at (2,2), I choose a direction.\n> \n> Say I move U to (2,3). Then:\n> \n> - New head: (2,3)\n> \n> - Body segments: the previous head (2,2) becomes the first body segment, then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), and tail (2,4) is removed because no food eaten. So the snake now has head at (2,3), then body: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4). And (2,4) is gone.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move D to (2,1), new head (2,1), body (2,2), (1,2), etc., tail removed.\n> \n> Now, food at (2,5): it is currently occupied by a body segment. When the snake moves, if that segment moves away, the food might become accessible.\n> \n> For example, if in some move, the body moves from (2,5), then (2,5) is free, and if head moves there, it can eat the food.\n> \n> But in the current move, head is at (2,2), not near (2,5).\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,3) is free, I think. Let's see if (5,3) is occupied.\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), etc., no (5,3), so (5,3) is free and has food.\n> \n> (5,3) is a valid cell, no wall, so I can go there to eat it.\n> \n> But it's at (5,3), head at (2,2), so I need to navigate there.\n> \n> First, let's consider the two possible moves for turn 90: U or D.\n> \n> Also, I need to think about risks.

After removing (2,4), the new tail is (3,4)? Positions: the last segment was (2,4), removed, so the new last is (3,4), which was second last.\n> \n> From the list, after removal, segments: 1. head (2,3), 2. (2,2), 3. (1,2), 4. (1,3), 5.

Let's count.\n> \n> Original 17 segments: indices 1 to 17.\n> \n> After move: new head at (2,3), which is new position, so the body has the old head (2,2) as first body, then the next 15 segments from old body except the tail is removed. Old segments: positions 2 to 17: (1,2) to (2,4).\n> \n> When head moves to new cell, the new body is: [previous head] + [all body segments except the last one if no food eaten].\n> \n> Standard: the snake moves, so the new head is at new position, the new body consists of the previous head position followed by all previous body positions except the tail is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> So here, previous head (2,2) becomes new first body segment.\n> \n> Previous body segments: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), and the tail (2,4) is removed.\n> \n> So new snake: head (2,3), body: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), and (3,4) is the last body segment, so tail at (3,4).\n> \n> Number of segments: 16, since no growth.\n> \n> Now, food at (2,5) is still there, but it's occupied by body segment at index 7: (2,5).\n> \n> For it to be eaten, the body must move away, meaning that segment moves to another cell, so (2,5) is free, then head moves there.\n> \n> But currently, head is at (2,3), so not adjacent.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,3) is free.\n> \n> Life span: (2,5) has life span 6, so from turn 90, it will disappear after 6 turns, so available on turns 90,91,92,93,94,95, gone on turn 96.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) life span 8, available turns 90 to 97, gone 98.\n> \n> Turn 90 is current, so it decreases each turn including current, so after turn 90, life span decreases to 5 for (2,5), etc.\n> \n> For food at (2,5), it can be eaten only if the body moves away from it.\n> \n> The body segment at (2,5) will move when the snake moves. Depending on the path, it might move away soon.\n> \n> For example, if the snake continues to move, the segment at (2,5) is not the tail, so it will move to where the previous segment was or something.\n> \n> The body segments move based on the head movement; each body segment follows the path.\n> \n> Specifically, when the head moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> In this case, the segment at (2,5) is the 7th segment. When the snake moves, it will move to the position of the 6th segment, which is (2,6)?

So the snake has 17 segments.\n> \n> The head direction is R, meaning it's moving right. So from (3,3), it was moving to the right, but since the next position is (2,3), which is left, that might be a mistake. Let me plot this out.\n> \n> Head at (3,3), direction R, so it came from left? Positions: [(3,3), (2,3), (2,2), ...]. From (3,3) to (2,3) is left, but direction is given as R. That seems inconsistent. Direction should indicate where the head is facing or moving next? The state says \"Snake Head Direction: R\", which probably means the current direction it's moving, but from the positions, it was at (3,3) and moving to where? The positions list is the current state, so head is at (3,3), and the next segment is (2,3), which is left of head, so actually, the snake is moving left? But direction is given as R. I think there might be confusion.\n> \n> Re-reading: \"Snake Head Direction: R\" and \"Snake Positions: [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...]\" with head first.

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State (Turn 93)\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state at Turn 93 based on the provided information:\n\n- **Grid Dimensions**: 8x8 (x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7)\n- **Walls**:\n  - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n  - Internal Obstacle: (3, 2)\n- **Snake Positions**: \n  - Head: (4, 3)\n  - Body: [(3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4)]\n  - Tail: (5, 4)\n- **Snake Head Direction**: R (Right)\n- **Food**:\n  - (2, 5): Value = +1, Life Span = 3 (disappears after Turn 95)\n  - (5, 3): Value = +1, Life Span = 5 (disappears after Turn 97)\n  - (5, 1): Value = +1, Life Span = 8 (disappears after Turn 100)\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (4, 3)\n\nGiven the snake's current direction is Right (R), the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (4, 4)\n   - Check if (4, 4) is occupied or a wall.\n   - Snake positions: (4, 4) is not in the body list.\n   - Walls: (4, 4) is not a wall.\n   - **Valid Move**\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (4, 2)\n   - Check if (4, 2) is occupied or a wall.\n   - Snake positions: (4, 2) is not in the body list.\n   - Walls: (4, 2) is not a wall (internal obstacle is at (3, 2)).\n   - **Valid Move**\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (5, 3)\n   - Check if (5, 3) is occupied or a wall.\n   - Snake positions: (5, 3) is not in the body list.\n   - Walls: (5, 3) is not a wall.\n   - **Valid Move** (and has food with value +1)\n\n4. **Left (L)**: (3, 3)\n   - Opposite direction to current (R), so **Invalid Move** (no instant reverse)\n   - Also, (3, 3) is occupied by the body.\n\nSo, the valid immediate moves are: U, D, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (5, 3)\n- **Pros**:\n  - Eats positive food at (5, 3), increasing score by +1 and snake length by 1.\n  - Life span of this food is 5, so it's safe to eat now.\n- **Cons**:\n  - Moving away from the food at (2, 5), which has a shorter life span (disappears after Turn 95).\n\n**After Move**:\n- New head: (5, 3)\n- New body: [(4, 3), (3, 3), ..., (5, 4)] (length increases by 1)\n- Direction after move: R\n\nFrom (5, 3), possible next moves (assuming direction is R):\n- U: (5, 4) - occupied by new tail (5, 4), but safe (tail moves away)\n- D: (5, 2) - free\n- R: (6, 3) - free\n- L: (4, 3) - body, collision\n\nSo, can continue towards other food or explore.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (4, 4)\n- **Pros**:\n  - Moves towards center, possibly opening more options.\n- **Cons**:\n  - Doesn't eat any food immediately.\n  - Risk of getting trapped if not careful.\n\n**After Move**:\n- New head: (4, 4)\n- New body: [(4, 3), (3, 3), ..., (5, 4)] (tail (5, 4) is removed)\n- Direction after move: U\n\nFrom (4, 4), possible next moves (direction U):\n- U: (4, 5) - occupied by body (4, 5), collision\n- D: (4, 3) - body, collision\n- L: (3, 4) - free\n- R: (5, 4) - free (but was tail, now free)\n\nSo, can move L or R. Moving L to (3, 4) might lead to dead ends as seen in previous analysis.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (4, 2)\n- **Pros**:\n  - Moves away from crowded areas.\n- **Cons**:\n  - Doesn't eat any food immediately.\n  - Moves towards the bottom where options might be limited.\n\n**After Move**:\n- New head: (4, 2)\n- New body: [(4, 3), (3, 3), ..., (5, 4)] (tail (5, 4) is removed)\n- Direction after move: D\n\nFrom (4, 2), possible next moves (direction D):\n- U: (4, 3) - body, collision\n- D: (4, 1) - free\n- L: (3, 2) - wall (internal obstacle)\n- R: (5, 2) - free\n\nSo, can move D or R. \n\n### Considering Food at (2, 5)\n\nThe food at (2, 5) is under the body segment (2, 5). To eat it:\n1. The body must move away from (2, 5).\n2. The head must then move to (2, 5).\n\nGiven the current body positions, the segment at (2, 5) is connected to (1, 5) before and (2, 6) after. To free (2, 5), the snake needs to move in a way that (1, 5) moves, causing (2, 5) to shift to (1, 5)'s old position.\n\nHowever, this requires complex maneuvering and may not be feasible within the remaining life span (until Turn 95). Attempting this could lead to dead ends or collisions, as seen in the previous analysis where moving towards (2, 4) trapped the snake.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the risks associated with trying to reach (2, 5) and the immediate benefit of eating the food at (5, 3), the safest and most rewarding immediate action is to move **Right (R)** to (5, 3). This:\n- Increases the score by +1.\n- Grows the snake, which can be beneficial for future moves.\n- Avoids potential traps near (2, 5).\n\nAfter this move, the snake can consider moving towards (5, 1) next, which has a longer life span and is safer to reach.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the immediate action at Turn 93 is:\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Positions: [(3,3), (2,3), (2,2), ...]. From (3,3) to (2,3) is left, but direction is given as R. That seems inconsistent. Direction should indicate where the head is facing or moving next? The state says \"Snake Head Direction: R\", which probably means the current direction it's moving, but from the positions, it was at (3,3) and moving to where? The positions list is the current state, so head is at (3,3), and the next segment is (2,3), which is left of head, so actually, the snake is moving left? But direction is given as R. I think there might be confusion.\n> \n> Re-reading: \"Snake Head Direction: R\" and \"Snake Positions: [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...]\" with head first. So at this turn, head is at (3,3), and it was moving right to get to (3,3)? But the previous position should be where it came from.\n> \n> Perhaps the direction is the direction it is facing, meaning it can move in that direction next. But the positions show that from (3,3), the body is at (2,3), which is left, so if it was moving right to (3,3), the previous head position should be (2,3)? I'm getting confused.\n> \n> Let me list the positions in order:\n> \n> Index 0: (3,3) head\n> \n> Index 1: (2,3) body\n> \n> Index 2: (2,2) body\n> \n> Index 3: (1,2) body\n> \n> Index 4: (1,3) body\n> \n> Index 5: (1,4) body\n> \n> Index 6: (1,5) body\n> \n> Index 7: (2,5) body\n> \n> Index 8: (2,6) body\n> \n> Index 9: (3,6) body\n> \n> Index 10: (3,5) body\n> \n> Index 11: (4,5) body\n> \n> Index 12: (5,5) body\n> \n> Index 13: (6,5) body\n> \n> Index 14: (6,4) body\n> \n> Index 15: (5,4) body\n> \n> Index 16: (4,4) tail\n> \n> Now, the head is at (3,3) and direction is R, meaning it can move right, up, down, or left, but with no instant reverse, so it cannot move left because that would be opposite to current direction R.\n> \n> Current direction is R (right), so possible moves are U, D, R, but not L (left), because L is opposite to R.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 1 and life span 4\n> \n> - (5,3) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1 and life span 9\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all are positive food.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current turn. So at turn 92, life span 4 means it will disappear after 4 more turns? Life span is given as the remaining turns it exists.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (2,5), life_span=4, so it will disappear after turn 92 + 4 = turn 96, meaning it exists on turns 92,93,94,95, and disappears at turn 96.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) life_span=6, exists until turn 92+6-1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, life_span N, it decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So if life_span = N at turn t, it will be present for N turns including turn t, so from turn t to turn t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n> \n> For (2,5): life_span=4 at turn 92, so present on turns 92,93,94,95; disappears at turn 96.\n> \n> (5,3): life_span=6, present turns 92 to 97, disappears at 98.\n> \n> (5,1): life_span=9, present turns 92 to 100, disappears at 101.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: border cells, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.

Moving here is safe (tail moves away).\n   - No food is eaten.\n   - This does not help vacate (2, 5) in time.\n\n2. **D (Down) to (5, 2)**:\n   - (5, 2) is empty and safe.\n   - No food is eaten.\n   - This does not help vacate (2, 5) in time.\n\n3. **R (Right) to (6, 3)**:\n   - (6, 3) is empty and safe.\n   - No food is eaten.\n   - This does not help vacate (2, 5) in time.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the immediate moves can vacate (2, 5) in time to eat it before it disappears.

The grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, I think? Walls are at x=0 and x=7, so the grid goes from x=1 to x=6? Similarly for y. Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. So, any cell with x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is a wall. Therefore, the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? But in the snake positions, I see (1,2), (1,3), etc., and x=1 and y=1 should be okay since walls are at x=0 and y=0, so boundaries are from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6.

Possible moves:\n1. **U (Up)**: (5,5)\n   - Check collision: (5,5) is occupied by the body (segment at index 14 in the list). **Deadly collision**.\n2. **L (Left)**: (4,4)\n   - Check collision: (4,4) is not in the snake positions. **Safe**.\n3. **R (Right)**: (6,4)\n   - Check collision: (6,4) is the tail. Moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move away. **Safe**.\n\n### Food Considerations:\n- (2,5): Life_span=1 (disappears after this turn). Currently under the snake's body at (2,5). To eat it:\n  - The body must move away from (2,5), then the head must move onto it.\n  - This is impossible in one move because the head is not adjacent to (2,5) after any move. **Cannot eat (2,5)**.\n- (5,1): Life_span=6. Not urgent.\n- (1,4): Life_span=9. Not urgent.\n\n### Best Move:\n- **Move R (Right) to (6,4)**:\n  - Safe (tail moves away).\n  - Opens up future paths to explore the right side of the grid.\n  - Avoids trapping the snake in the current coiled position.\n\n### Why Not L (Left) to (4,4)?\n- While safe, it might lead to a more confined space given the snake's current coiling and the obstacle at (3,2).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

The grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, I think? Walls are at x=0 and x=7, so the grid goes from x=1 to x=6? Similarly for y. Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. So, any cell with x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is a wall. Therefore, the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? But in the snake positions, I see (1,2), (1,3), etc., and x=1 and y=1 should be okay since walls are at x=0 and y=0, so boundaries are from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6. Let me list the snake positions to see min and max.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)]\n> \n> x-coordinates: 5,4,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,5,6,6,5 → min x=1, max x=6\n> \n> y-coordinates: 3,3,3,3,2,2,3,4,5,5,6,6,5,5,5,5,4,4 → min y=2, max y=6\n> \n> y=1 is not present, but since walls are at y=0, y=1 should be playable.
