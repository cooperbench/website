The available moves are:\n1. U (up): (3, 3) → (3, 4)\n2. D (down): (3, 3) → (3, 2) → but (3, 2) is an internal obstacle (wall), so invalid.\n3. L (left): (3, 3) → (2, 3)\n\nThus, the valid immediate actions are **U** or **L**.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n#### Option 1: Move U to (3, 4)\n- New head position: (3, 4)\n- Direction becomes U.\n- Next steps to reach food:\n  - From (3, 4), can move L to (2, 4), then L to (1, 4) to eat the food at (1, 4) on turn 2.\n  - Alternatively, could move R to (4, 4), but this doesn't lead directly to food.\n\n#### Option 2: Move L to (2, 3)\n- New head position: (2, 3)\n- Direction remains L.\n- Next steps to reach food:\n  - From (2, 3), can move U to (2, 4), then L to (1, 4) to eat the food at (1, 4) on turn 2.\n  - Alternatively, can move D to (2, 2), then L to (1, 2) to eat the food at (1, 2) on turn 2.\n\n### Comparing Paths:\n- Both options (U or L) allow reaching (1, 4) in 2 turns.\n- Moving L first allows an additional path to (1, 2) in 2 turns, which is more flexible.\n- The food at (6, 6) is too far to consider immediately.\n\n### Risks:\n- After eating, the snake will grow to length 2, but since the initial length is 1, there is no risk of body collision yet.\n- The tail reward danger is not applicable here since the snake is length 1 (no tail yet).\n\n### Decision:\nMoving **L (left)** to (2, 3) is the better immediate action because:\n1. It allows reaching either (1, 4) or (1, 2) in the next steps, providing more flexibility.\n2. It doesn't restrict future movements more than moving U would.\n3. It keeps the snake away from the internal obstacle at (3, 2).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{L}",

This aligns with the plan to eventually reach and eat the positive food at (1, 4) by turn 2. \n\nHere’s the reasoning for the immediate action at \\( t_0 = 1 \\):\n1. **Current State**: Snake at [(2, 3)], head direction L.  \n2. **Valid Moves**: Cannot reverse (R is invalid). D to (2, 2) is blocked by the internal obstacle (3, 2). Thus, only U (to (2, 4)) or L (to (1, 3)) are valid.  \n3. **Plan Alignment**: The previous plan (from \\( t_1 = 0 \\)) was to move L to (2, 3) at \\( t_0 = 0 \\), then U to (2, 4) at \\( t_0 = 1 \\), followed by L to (1, 4) to eat the food at turn 2. However, since the snake is already at (2, 3) at \\( t_0 = 1 \\), moving L to (1, 3) is safer (avoids potential future collisions) and still allows reaching (1, 4) via (1, 3) → (1, 4) next.  \n\n### Immediate Action:\n\\boxed{L}  \n\n### Additional Context:\n- Moving L to (1, 3) at \\( t_0 = 1 \\) ensures the snake is positioned to eat (1, 4) on the next turn (\\( t_0 = 2 \\)) by moving U to (1, 4).  \n- This avoids the risk of colliding with the body segment if the snake grows after eating (1, 4).  \n- The alternative (U to (2, 4)) would require an extra turn to reach (1, 4) and could complicate future movements.  \n\nThe action sequence continues as planned:  \n- \\( t_0 = 1 \\): L to (1, 3)  \n- \\( t_0 = 2 \\): U to (1, 4) (eat food)  \n- Follow the remaining plan to (6, 6).  \n\nThis ensures optimal score while minimizing risk.",

But y=7 is a wall. **Invalid**.\n2. **Down (D)**: (5,6) → (5,5). Check:\n   - Not a wall.\n   - Not occupied by the snake's body (body is at (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)).\n   - No food at (5,5). **Valid**.\n3. **Left (L)**: (5,6) → (4,6). Check:\n   - Not a wall.\n   - Not occupied by the snake's body.\n   - No food at (4,6). **Valid**.\n4. **Right (R)**: Opposite to current direction L. **Invalid**.\n\nSo, valid immediate actions: D or L.\n\n### Evaluating the Moves\n\n**Option 1: Move Down (D) to (5,5)**\n\n- **Immediate Effect**:\n  - New head: (5,5).\n  - Body: [(5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)]. Tail (6,4) is removed.\n- **Future Considerations**:\n  - Food at (1,6) has life_span=4 (present until turn 14).\n    - To reach (1,6) from (5,5):\n      - Need at least 4 moves (left 4, up 1 → min 4 moves).\n      - E.g., (5,5)→(4,5)→(3,5)→(2,5)→(1,5)→(1,6) → but (1,6) is gone by turn 15.\n    - Cannot reach (1,6) before it disappears.\n  - Other foods:\n    - (4,4): life_span=6 (until turn 16).\n      - From (5,5), can reach (4,4) in fewer moves, but need to plan path carefully.\n    - (4,2): life_span=9 (until turn 19).\n      - More time to reach.\n\n**Option 2: Move Left (L) to (4,6)**\n\n- **Immediate Effect**:\n  - New head: (4,6).\n  - Body: [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)]. Tail (6,4) is removed.\n- **Future Considerations**:\n  - Food at (1,6):\n    - Can reach in 3 moves: (4,6)→(3,6)→(2,6)→(1,6) at turn 14 (just before it disappears).\n    - Eating at (1,6) on turn 14:\n      - Snake grows: [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)].\n      - Then, from (1,6), possible moves:\n        - U: (1,7) wall → invalid.\n        - D: (1,5).\n        - L: (0,6) wall → invalid.\n        - R: (2,6) → body segment → collision.\n      - Only valid move: D to (1,5).\n  - Other foods:\n    - After eating (1,6), can plan to reach (4,4) or (4,2), but (4,4) disappears at turn 16, which may be hard to reach in time.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe primary goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. \n\n- **Food at (1,6)**:\n  - High priority due to short life_span (only until turn 14).\n  - Can be safely reached by moving left now (turn 11: L to (4,6)) and continuing left in subsequent turns.\n  - Missing it means losing a +1 score opportunity.\n- **Other Foods**:\n  - (4,4) and (4,2) have longer life_spans, so can be targeted after securing (1,6).\n\n**Risk Assessment**:\n- Moving left to (4,6) is safe (no immediate collision or wall).\n- Path to (1,6) is clear (no obstacles or body segments in the way).\n- After eating (1,6), the snake can move down to (1,5) to avoid getting stuck.\n\n**Alternative (Moving Down)**:\n- Cannot reach (1,6) in time.\n- May reach other foods, but missing (1,6) is a lost opportunity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe optimal immediate action is to move **Left (L)** to (4,6) to start the path towards eating the food at (1,6) before it disappears.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state at Turn \\( t_0 = 16 \\):\n\n- **Grid Dimensions**: Playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), with walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n- **Internal Obstacle**: (3,2) is blocked.\n- **Snake**:\n  - Positions: [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] (head at (1,5), tail at (4,6))\n  - Current direction: Down (D)\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,4): value=1, life_span=1 (disappears after Turn 16)\n  - (4,2): value=1, life_span=4 (disappears after Turn 19)\n  - (6,1): value=1, life_span=7 (disappears after Turn 22)\n  - (4,3): value=1, life_span=10 (disappears after Turn 25)\n\nFrom the previous thinking model's output at Turn 15, the snake was forced to move Down to (1,5) because other directions were blocked or led to collisions. Now, at Turn 16, the snake is at (1,5) with direction Down.\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 16\n\nFrom (1,5), with current direction Down, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Down (D)**: (1,4)\n   - Check: (1,4) is within bounds, not a wall, and not occupied by the snake's body (current body segments are at (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)). Valid.\n2. **Left (L)**: (0,5)\n   - Check: x=0 is a wall. Invalid.\n3. **Right (R)**: (2,5)\n   - Check: (2,5) is within bounds. Is it occupied by the snake's body? Current body segments are at (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). (2,5) is not in this list. Valid.\n4. **Up (U)**: (1,6)\n   - Check: (1,6) is the first body segment after the head. Moving here would collide with the body (not the tail, since tail is at (4,6)). Invalid.\n\nAdditionally, we cannot make an instant reverse. Current direction is Down, so Up is the reverse, which is already invalid due to collision. So, possible valid moves: Down (D) or Right (R).\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\n**Option 1: Move Down to (1,4)**\n\n- New head position: (1,4)\n- New direction: Down\n- New snake positions: [(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)]\n  - Tail moves from (4,6) to (3,6)\n  \nFrom (1,4), possible next moves (for future planning):\n- Down to (1,3)\n- Right to (2,4)\n- Up to (1,5) (body segment, invalid unless it's the tail, but tail is at (3,6))\n  \nSo, from (1,4), can move Down or Right.\n\n**Option 2: Move Right to (2,5)**\n\n- New head position: (2,5)\n- New direction: Right\n- New snake positions: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)]\n  - Tail moves from (4,6) to (3,6)\n\nFrom (2,5), possible next moves (for future planning):\n- Right to (3,5)\n- Down to (2,4)\n- Up to (2,6) (body segment, invalid unless tail, but tail is at (3,6))\n  \nSo, from (2,5), can move Right or Down.\n\n### Food Accessibility\n\nNow, let's assess if any food is reachable within its lifespan.\n\n1. **Food at (4,4)**: life_span=1 (disappears after Turn 16)\n   - To eat at Turn 16, head must be at (4,4) at Turn 16.\n   - Current head is at (1,5). Distance: |4-1| + |4-5| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n   - Need to reach in 0 moves (since action is at Turn 16, and food disappears after). Impossible. So, cannot eat (4,4).\n\n2. **Food at (4,2)**: life_span=4 (disappears after Turn 19)\n   - Must be eaten by Turn 19.\n   - From Turn 16 to 19: 4 moves (Turns 16,17,18,19).\n   - Distance from (1,5) to (4,2): |4-1| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6.\n   - Need to reach in 4 moves: impossible (minimum moves is 6 > 4).\n   - Cannot eat (4,2).\n\n3. **Food at (6,1)**: life_span=7 (disappears after Turn 22)\n   - Must be eaten by Turn 22.\n   - From Turn 16 to 22: 7 moves.\n   - Distance from (1,5) to (6,1): |6-1| + |1-5| = 5 + 4 = 9.\n   - Need to reach in 7 moves: impossible (minimum moves is 9 > 7).\n   - Cannot eat (6,1).\n\n4. **Food at (4,3)**: life_span=10 (disappears after Turn 25)\n   - Must be eaten by Turn 25.\n   - From Turn 16 to 25: 10 moves.\n   - Distance from (1,5) to (4,3): |4-1| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5.\n   - Possible to reach in 5 moves, but need to check path with obstacle at (3,2).\n   - Example path: \n     - Turn 16: R to (2,5)\n     - Turn 17: R to (3,5)\n     - Turn 18: D to (3,4)\n     - Turn 19: D to (3,3) (but (3,2) is blocked, so cannot go down further)\n     - Turn 20: R to (4,3) (eat here at Turn 20)\n   - But need to eat by Turn 25, so this is possible.\n   - However, the previous thinking model concluded that all food is unreachable, which seems incorrect for (4,3).\n\nWait, the previous thinking model might have missed (4,3) because it focused on (4,2) and (6,1). Let's re-examine:\n\nFrom (1,5), to reach (4,3):\n\nOption: Move Right first\n- Turn 16: R to (2,5)\n- Turn 17: R to (3,5)\n- Turn 18: D to (3,4)\n- Turn 19: D to (3,3)\n- Turn 20: R to (4,3) (eat here)\n\nThis takes 5 moves (Turns 16-20), and food is available until Turn 25, so this is feasible.\n\nSimilarly, another path:\n- Turn 16: D to (1,4)\n- Turn 17: D to (1,3)\n- Turn 18: R to (2,3)\n- Turn 19: R to (3,3)\n- Turn 20: R to (4,3) (eat here)\n\nAlso 5 moves.\n\nSo, (4,3) is reachable by Turn 20, well within its lifespan (disappears after Turn 25).\n\n### Decision for Turn 16\n\nGiven that (4,3) is reachable, we should aim to eat it. The two possible initial moves are:\n\n1. **Move Down to (1,4)**:\n   - Then path: D, D, R, R, R to (4,3) by Turn 20.\n2. **Move Right to (2,5)**:\n   - Then path: R, R, D, D, R to (4,3) by Turn 20.\n\nBoth are feasible. Let's choose the first one for simplicity (moving down first).\n\n### Action Sequence to Reach (4,3)\n\n- **Turn 16**: D to (1,4)\n- **Turn 17**: D to (1,3)\n- **Turn 18**: R to (2,3)\n- **Turn 19**: R to (3,3)\n- **Turn 20**: R to (4,3) (eat here)\n\nThis sequence ensures we reach the food at (4,3) by Turn 20.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Check if the tail has food under it at any point where the head is adjacent to the tail. Currently, no food is under the snake's body, so no danger.\n- **Collisions**: Each move is to an empty cell or the tail (which moves away), so no collisions.\n\n### Final Decision\n\n\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",

Move R to (4,4) at Turn 19.\n2. Move D to (4,3) at Turn 20 to eat the food there.\n3. Then proceed towards (3,1) by moving left and down in subsequent turns.\n\nHowever, we're now at Turn 21, and the snake's position is [(4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5)], which suggests that the snake has already eaten the food at (4,3) (since the length is now 6, up from the initial length at Turn 19 which was 5). \n\nThis implies that the moves at Turn 19 (R to (4,4)) and Turn 20 (D to (4,3)) have already been executed, and now we're at Turn 21 deciding the next move.\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 21\n\nGiven the snake's head is at (4,3) and the current direction is R (right), the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (4,4)\n   - Check if (4,4) is free:\n     - Not part of the snake's body: The body is at (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5). (4,4) is not in this list.\n     - Not a wall: Walls are at borders and (3,2). (4,4) is not a wall.\n   - So, (4,4) is free.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (4,2)\n   - Check if (4,2) is free:\n     - Not part of the snake's body.\n     - Not a wall.\n     - However, the food at (6,1) has a life_span of 3, meaning it will disappear after Turn 23. (4,2) is not a food position in the current state, so it's just an empty cell.\n   - So, (4,2) is free.\n\n3. **Left (L)**: (3,3)\n   - Check if (3,3) is free:\n     - It's part of the snake's body (second segment).\n     - However, the tail is at (1,5), and when the snake moves, the tail will move away unless we eat food (which we're not at (3,3)).\n     - But moving left would reverse the direction from right to left, which is not allowed (no instant reverse rule).\n   - So, L is not allowed.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: (5,3)\n   - Check if (5,3) is free:\n     - Not part of the snake's body.\n     - Not a wall.\n   - So, (5,3) is free.\n\nHowever, the \"no instant reverse\" rule states that you cannot move in the opposite direction of the current head direction on the next turn. The current head direction is R (right), so the opposite is L (left). Therefore, L is not allowed, but U, D, and R are allowed.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible moves (U, D, R):\n\n1. **Up (U) to (4,4)**:\n   - No food at (4,4).\n   - New head position: (4,4)\n   - Body: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)\n   - Tail (1,5) is removed.\n   - This move doesn't eat any food but moves the snake upwards, potentially opening space.\n\n2. **Down (D) to (4,2)**:\n   - No food at (4,2).\n   - New head position: (4,2)\n   - Body: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)\n   - Tail (1,5) is removed.\n   - This moves the snake downwards, but (4,2) is close to the wall at (3,2), which might limit future movements.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (5,3)**:\n   - No food at (5,3).\n   - New head position: (5,3)\n   - Body: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)\n   - Tail (1,5) is removed.\n   - Moves the snake to the right, towards the food at (6,1).\n\n### Considering the Food\n\nThe remaining foods are at (6,1) and (3,1):\n\n- **(6,1)**:\n  - Life_span: 3 (disappears after Turn 23)\n  - Distance from (4,3): |6-4| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4 moves away.\n  - To reach (6,1) by Turn 23, we have Turns 21, 22, and 23 (3 moves).\n  - So, it's possible if we move directly towards it:\n    - Turn 21: R to (5,3)\n    - Turn 22: R to (6,3)\n    - Turn 23: D to (6,1) (eat the food)\n  \n- **(3,1)**:\n  - Life_span: 8 (disappears after Turn 28)\n  - More time is available, so we can plan to eat this after (6,1).\n\n### Potential Path to (6,1)\n\nIf we choose to go for (6,1):\n\n1. Turn 21: R to (5,3)\n2. Turn 22: R to (6,3)\n3. Turn 23: D to (6,1) (eat the food)\n\nThis sequence would allow us to eat the food at (6,1) before it disappears.\n\n### Checking for Collisions and Validity\n\nLet's verify each move in the sequence:\n\n- **Turn 21: R to (5,3)**:\n  - Current head at (4,3), direction R.\n  - Move R to (5,3): valid (no body or wall).\n  - New head direction: R.\n  \n- **Turn 22: R to (6,3)**:\n  - Head at (5,3), direction R.\n  - Move R to (6,3): valid (no body or wall).\n  - New head direction: R.\n  \n- **Turn 23: D to (6,1)**:\n  - Head at (6,3), direction R.\n  - Move D to (6,1): valid (no body or wall), and eats the food at (6,1).\n  - New head direction: D.\n\nNo collisions or rule violations in this path.\n\n### Alternative Moves\n\nIf we choose not to go for (6,1), perhaps because it's risky or we prefer to go for (3,1), we might consider:\n\n1. Turn 21: U to (4,4)\n   - Then possibly move towards (3,1), but this would take longer and (6,1) would disappear.\n\n2. Turn 21: D to (4,2)\n   - Then move towards (3,1), but this seems less direct and may not be as efficient.\n\nGiven that (6,1) is about to disappear soon (after Turn 23), and it's reachable within the remaining turns, it's more optimal to go for it now and then plan for (3,1) later.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action at Turn 21 is to move **Right (R)** to (5,3), initiating the path to eat the food at (6,1) before it disappears at Turn 24.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state at Turn 24:\n\n- **Grid Size**: 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- **Walls**:\n  - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n  - Internal Obstacle: (3,2)\n- **Snake**:\n  - Positions: [(4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)] (head at (4,4), tail at (3,4))\n  - Length: 6\n  - Current Direction: Left (L)\n- **Food**:\n  - (3,1): value +1, life span 6 (will disappear after Turn 29)\n  - (4,5): value +1, life span 8 (will disappear after Turn 31)\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 24\n\nFrom the head position (4,4) with current direction L, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (4,5)\n   - Check:\n     - Not a wall: (4,5) is within bounds and not an internal obstacle.\n     - Not occupied by snake body: (4,5) is not in the snake's current positions.\n     - Contains food: Yes, (4,5) has positive food.\n   - Outcome: Move to (4,5), eat food, snake grows to length 7.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (4,3)\n   - Check:\n     - Occupied by snake body: (4,3) is the 4th segment (not the tail).\n     - Moving here would cause a collision because the body segment at (4,3) would shift into the new head position after the move.\n   - Outcome: Invalid (collision).\n\n3. **Left (L)**: (3,4)\n   - Check:\n     - Occupied by snake tail: (3,4) is the tail.\n     - Moving here is safe because the tail will move away after the move.\n     - No food at (3,4).\n   - Outcome: Move to (3,4), no growth, snake length remains 6.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: (5,4)\n   - Check:\n     - Opposite to current direction (L), so invalid.\n   - Outcome: Invalid.\n\nThus, the valid immediate moves are **U (Up)** and **L (Left)**.\n\n### Evaluating Move U (Up to (4,5))\n\n**Pros**:\n- Immediate reward: +1 score and snake grows to length 7.\n- Food at (4,5) has a longer life span (until Turn 31), so less urgency.\n\n**Cons**:\n- After eating, the snake is at (4,5), direction U.\n  - Next moves would be to navigate towards (3,1), which is complicated due to the wall at (3,2).\n- May lead to a longer path to reach (3,1), risking its disappearance by Turn 29.\n\n### Evaluating Move L (Left to (3,4))\n\n**Pros**:\n- Moves the snake closer to (3,1), which has a shorter life span (until Turn 29).\n- Allows for a more straightforward path to reach (3,1) by going around the wall at (3,2).\n\n**Cons**:\n- No immediate reward; snake length remains the same.\n- Food at (4,5) is still available but can be targeted later.\n\n### Long-term Planning\n\nGiven that the food at (3,1) will disappear sooner (Turn 29 vs. Turn 31 for (4,5)), it's more urgent to plan a path to (3,1). \n\nFrom (3,4) after moving L:\n- Next move could be D to (3,3) (tail moves away, safe).\n- Then, from (3,3), can move L to (2,3), then D to (2,2), D to (2,1), then R to (3,1) to eat the food.\n\nThis path avoids the wall at (3,2) and efficiently reaches (3,1).\n\nAlternatively, moving U first to (4,5) makes reaching (3,1) more convoluted due to the snake's increased length and positioning.\n\n### Decision\n\nPrioritize reaching the food with the shorter life span first. Therefore, the better immediate move is **L (Left)** to (3,4), setting up a path to (3,1).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

The next step in the sequence is **Down (D)** at Turn 25 to safely progress toward (3,1).\n2. **Current State**: The snake’s head is at (3,4), direction **L**, and moving **D** to (3,3) is safe (it’s the tail segment, which will move away). This aligns with the plan to navigate around the obstacle.\n3. **Risk Avoidance**: Moving **U** or **R** would deviate from the optimal path or risk collisions. The food at (4,5) can be pursued later (life span 7 remaining).\n\n### Immediate Action for Turn 25:\n\\boxed{D}  \n\n**Note**: This action continues the pre-planned sequence to secure the +1 reward at (3,1) efficiently.",

This means the snake was moving downward to reach (2,1) from (2,2) in the previous move.\n\n- **Food**:\n  1. (3,1): value = +1, life_span = 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten).\n  2. (4,5): value = +1, life_span = 3.\n  3. (1,5): value = +1, life_span = 9.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (2,1) with Direction D\n\nFrom the head at (2,1) moving Down (D), the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (2,0) \n   - y=0 is a border wall → Invalid.\n2. **Down (D)**: (2,2)\n   - (2,2) is the second segment of the snake's body → Collision → Invalid.\n3. **Left (L)**: (1,1)\n   - Check:\n     - Not a wall: x=1,y=1 is within bounds and not listed as a wall.\n     - Not occupied by snake: Current snake positions are from (2,1) to (5,4); (1,1) is free.\n     - No food at (1,1) in the given list.\n   - Valid move.\n4. **Right (R)**: (3,1)\n   - Check:\n     - Not a wall: x=3,y=1 is within bounds; internal wall is at (3,2), not (3,1).\n     - Not occupied by snake: (3,1) is not in the snake's current positions.\n     - Food present: (3,1) has positive food with life_span = 1.\n   - Valid move.\n\n**Valid Immediate Moves**: Left (L) to (1,1) or Right (R) to (3,1).\n\n### Evaluating the Moves\n\n1. **Move Right (R) to (3,1)**:\n   - **Pros**:\n     - Eats positive food at (3,1) before it disappears after this turn.\n     - Increases snake length by 1 (new length = 8).\n   - **Cons**:\n     - After moving to (3,1), the next moves might be limited:\n       - From (3,1), direction is Right (R).\n       - Possible next moves:\n         - Up (U): (3,0) → wall (y=0) → invalid.\n         - Down (D): (3,2) → internal wall → invalid.\n         - Left (L): (2,1) → body segment → invalid.\n         - Right (R): (4,1) → free.\n       - Only possible move is Right to (4,1), which may lead to being boxed in with limited future options.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (1,1)**:\n   - **Pros**:\n     - Keeps the snake length the same (no growth).\n     - Opens up space to potentially reach other foods like (1,5) in the future.\n   - **Cons**:\n     - Misses the opportunity to eat the food at (3,1), which will disappear after this turn.\n\n### Considering the Previous Plan (from Turn 28)\n\nThe previous plan at Turn 28 suggested:\n- Turn 28: U (to (2,1)) — already executed.\n- Turn 29: R (to (3,1)) — current turn is 29, so this suggests moving Right to (3,1).\n\nThe reasoning was to prioritize eating the expiring food at (3,1) and then move downward for long-term survival.\n\n### Potential Issues with Following the Previous Plan\n\n- After moving to (3,1), the only immediate next move is Right to (4,1), which may not be optimal for reaching other foods like (1,5) or (4,5).\n- The food at (4,5) has a life_span of 3, meaning it will disappear after Turn 31. From (4,1), reaching (4,5) by Turn 31 is impossible (requires at least 4 moves: (4,1)→(4,2)→(4,3)→(4,4)→(4,5)), but Turn 31 is only 2 moves away from Turn 29.\n\n### Alternative Approach: Move Left to (1,1)\n\n- By moving Left to (1,1), we can start heading towards (1,5), which has a long life_span (9 turns).\n- Future moves could be:\n  - From (1,1), possible moves:\n    - Up (U): (1,0) → wall → invalid.\n    - Down (D): (1,2) → free.\n    - Left (L): (0,1) → wall → invalid.\n    - Right (R): (2,1) → body → invalid.\n    - Only Down to (1,2).\n  - Then from (1,2), can go Down to (1,3), and so on, eventually reaching (1,5).\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that the food at (3,1) is about to disappear and is positive, it's beneficial to eat it to maximize the score. Even though it may limit immediate future moves, the score gain is valuable. The previous plan's reasoning aligns with this, and the potential limitation in movement can be managed by carefully choosing subsequent moves to avoid dead ends.\n\n### Immediate Action\n\nAt Turn 29, the best immediate action is to follow the previous plan and move Right (R) to (3,1) to eat the food before it disappears.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Following the previous plan allows us to reach (1,3) by turn 35 and (1,5) by turn 37, which is within their life spans.\n\n### Verifying the Next Steps After Moving L at Turn 33\n\nAfter moving L to (3,3) at turn 33:\n\n- **Turn 34**: From (3,3), possible moves:\n  - L to (2,3): \n    - (2,3) is the new tail (from shifted body).\n    - Safe to move here.\n  - Other moves may not lead directly to food.\n\n- **Turn 35**: From (2,3), move L to (1,3) to eat the food there.\n\nThis aligns with the previous plan and ensures we eat both foods efficiently.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFollowing the previous plan's suggestion to move L at turn 33 is optimal because:\n\n1. It directly paths towards the positive food at (1,3) and subsequently (1,5).\n2. It avoids collisions and obstacles.\n3. It ensures eating both foods before their life spans expire.\n4. There are no immediate risks like Tail Reward Danger or body collisions.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Cannot be eaten immediately (must wait for body to move away).\n- **(2,2) and (1,1)**: Accessible but require multiple moves to reach. Not immediately relevant for the current turn.\n\n### Immediate Goal:\n- Avoid collisions and set up for future food collection. Since no food is immediately reachable, prioritize moves that keep the snake safe and flexible.\n\n### Best Move:\n- **Right (R) to (5,4)**:\n  - Moves the snake away from the coiled body, reducing immediate collision risks.\n  - Keeps options open for future moves (can go up/down next turn).\n  - Avoids trapping the snake in a corner or near walls.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Distance from head: |5-2| + |4-2| = 5 moves. Too far to reach in time (only 2 turns left after Turn 45).\n2. **(2, 6)**: Under body segment (2, 6). To eat, the body must move away, which is unlikely soon.\n3. **(1, 1)**: Life span 8 (plenty of time). Distance: |5-1| + |4-1| = 7 moves. Not urgent.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nSince the food at (2, 2) is unreachable in time and (2, 6) is under the body, the best immediate action is to **move towards the center to avoid trapping the snake**. \n\n- **Move R (Right) to (6, 4)**:\n  - Moves the head away from the coiled body.\n  - Keeps options open for future moves.\n  - Avoids immediate collisions.\n\n### Verification:\n- After moving R to (6, 4), the new head is at (6, 4), and the tail segment (1, 3) is removed. The body shifts forward:\n  - New positions: [(6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4)]\n- No collisions or wall hits.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate action is to move **right (R)** to (6, 4).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Impossible to reach in time (distance = 6, only 2 turns left).\n2. **(2,6)**: Life span 4 (disappears after turn 49). Occupied by body segment (segment 6). Cannot be eaten unless the tail moves to (2,6), which would take at least 3 moves (as calculated in the thinking model). Not feasible to eat this turn.\n3. **(1,1)**: Life span 7. Far away, no immediate plan to reach.\n4. **(5,4)**: Life span 10. Occupied by body segment (segment 1). Cannot be eaten unless the tail moves to (5,4), which is not possible soon.\n\n### Immediate Decision:\n- No food can be eaten this turn (turn 46).\n- Choose between U or D to avoid collision and plan for future moves.\n\n### Choice Between U and D:\n- **Move U (6,5)**:\n  - Next possible moves: From (6,5), can go U to (6,6), L to (5,5), or D to (6,4) (but (6,4) is the previous head position, now occupied by segment 1).\n  - Moving U opens space to potentially loop around the top.\n- **Move D (6,3)**:\n  - Next possible moves: From (6,3), can go D to (6,2), L to (5,3), or U to (6,4) (occupied by segment 1).\n  - Moving D avoids immediate dead ends and keeps options open.\n\n### Optimal Move:\n- **Move D (Down)** to (6,3). This avoids potential future collisions and keeps the snake's path flexible. Moving U could lead to being boxed in near the top wall.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}",

This would cause a collision (head touches body), so **invalid**.\n2. **D (down) to (6, 2)**:\n   - (6, 2) is free (no wall or snake). Valid.\n3. **L (left) to (5, 3)**:\n   - (5, 3) is free. Valid.\n4. **R (right) to (7, 3)**:\n   - (7, 3) is a wall (x=7). Invalid.\n\n### Movement Constraints:\n- **No instant reverse**: The head direction is D (down), so the opposite direction is U (up). Moving U is already invalid due to collision, so no issue here.\n- **Valid moves**: D or L.\n\n### Food Considerations:\n- (2, 2) will disappear after this turn, and it's too far to reach in one move (Manhattan distance from (6,3) to (2,2) is 4 + 1 = 5). Ignore.\n- (5, 4) is under the snake's body and cannot be eaten this turn (the body must move away first).\n- (1, 1) and (2, 6) are possible targets, but not reachable immediately.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nFrom the valid moves (D or L), neither leads to food this turn. We should choose a move that keeps the snake safe and potentially moves towards food in future turns. \n\n- Moving **D (down) to (6, 2)**:\n  - Moves the snake towards the bottom of the grid, closer to (1,1) in the long run.\n  - Avoids getting boxed in near the top-right corner.\n\n- Moving **L (left) to (5, 3)**:\n  - Moves the snake towards the center, but doesn't provide a clear advantage.\n\n### Decision:\nMove **D (down)** to (6, 2) to start navigating towards the bottom-left where (1,1) is located. This is a safe move that doesn't risk immediate collision and opens up future opportunities.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

This seems like a reasonable path because:\n\n- (2,4) is a positive food with a long life span (until Turn 58).\n- Moving left initially avoids the body cluster and the obstacle at (3,2).\n- It provides a clear path towards the food without immediate risks.\n\n### Immediate Decision at Turn 50\n\nGiven the above, the best immediate action at Turn 50 is to continue with the previous plan and move left to (4,1). This maintains the trajectory towards the (2,4) food and avoids potential body collisions or dead ends.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

This maintains mobility and access to future food.\n\n### Immediate Action for Turn 54:\n\\boxed{U}  \n\n### Additional Context:\n- The food at (5,4) (life span 3) is unreachable before it disappears (as calculated in the analysis), so it’s safely ignored.\n- The sequence (U → U → U) ensures the snake eats (2,4) on Turn 55, then can explore further (e.g., toward (6,3) with life span 8 remaining).",

Cannot move L (left) as it's opposite to current direction R.\n- **Food**: At (6, 3), value +1, life span 6 (will disappear after turn 62). Currently under the snake's body (not the tail).\n- **Tail**: At (6, 4).\n\n### Goal:\nEat the food at (6, 3) safely before it disappears (by turn 62). To do this:\n1. The body segment at (6, 3) must move away (i.e., it must become the tail and then the tail moves away).\n2. The head must then move to (6, 3) when it's free.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Turn 57**: Move in a direction that progresses the snake toward freeing (6, 3) and eventually reaching it.\n   - Moving right (R) to (4, 4) is a good choice because:\n     - It progresses the snake toward the right side where the food is.\n     - After this move, the tail will be at (6, 3) (food location), and (6, 4) will be freed.\n   - Moving up (U) or down (D) would not directly help free (6, 3) as quickly.\n\n2. **Subsequent Moves** (simulated for clarity):\n   - **Turn 57**: Move R to (4, 4). New tail is at (6, 3) (food location).\n   - **Turn 58**: Move R to (5, 4). Now (6, 3) is freed (tail moves to (6, 2)), and food is exposed at (6, 3).\n   - **Turn 59**: Move R to (6, 4). Now the head is adjacent to (6, 3) (food location).\n   - **Turn 60**: Move D to (6, 3) to eat the food. \n     - **Danger Check**: Head is adjacent to tail (which is at (6, 2)), but the food is at (6, 3), not under the tail. No Tail Reward Danger here because the tail is not on the food cell when eating.\n\n### Immediate Action (Turn 57):\nMove right (R) to (4, 4) to start the sequence toward the food.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{R}",

Not directly helpful for reaching food.\n\n2. **L (Left) to (5, 3)**:\n   - Safe (no collision).\n   - Moves closer to food (food is at x=5; current x=6 → moving to x=5).\n   - Future path: From (5, 3), can move L to (4, 3) or D to (5, 2). Potential to reach (5, 5) via (5, 3) → (5, 4) → (5, 5), but (5, 4) is occupied by body after this move (see below).\n\n### Food Access:\n- **Food at (5, 5)**:\n  - To reach (5, 5), need to go from (5, 3) → (5, 4) → (5, 5).\n  - After moving L to (5, 3), (5, 4) is occupied by body (segment S3). Cannot move U to (5, 4) → **Collision**.\n  - Thus, cannot reach (5, 5) immediately after L move.\n\n- **Food at (5, 6)**:\n  - To reach (5, 6), need to go from (5, 3) → (5, 4) → (5, 5) → (5, 6).\n  - Same issue: (5, 4) is blocked after L move.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Moving **L (Left)** to (5, 3) is better than moving D (Down) because:\n  - It aligns the snake's x-coordinate with the food (x=5).\n  - Even though immediate access to food is blocked, it opens future opportunities (e.g., from (5, 3), move D to (5, 2), then L to (4, 2), etc., to loop around).\n- Moving D (Down) leads to dead ends (bottom row) and away from food.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State (Turn \\( t_0 = 63 \\))\n\nFirst, let's parse the current state:\n\n- **Grid Dimensions**: The playable area is from \\( x=1 \\) to \\( x=6 \\) and \\( y=1 \\) to \\( y=6 \\). Walls are at \\( x=0, x=7 \\) and \\( y=0, y=7 \\). There's also an internal obstacle at \\( (3, 2) \\).\n  \n- **Snake Positions**: The snake's head is at \\( (4, 3) \\), followed by body segments in this order:\n  - Head: \\( (4, 3) \\)\n  - Body: \\( (5, 3) \\), \\( (6, 3) \\), \\( (6, 4) \\), \\( (5, 4) \\), \\( (4, 4) \\), \\( (3, 4) \\), \\( (2, 4) \\), \\( (2, 3) \\), \\( (2, 2) \\), \\( (2, 1) \\), \\( (3, 1) \\), \\( (4, 1) \\)\n  - Tail: \\( (5, 1) \\) (assuming the last segment is the tail)\n\n- **Snake Head Direction**: The head is currently moving left (`L`), meaning the previous move was to the left (from \\( (5, 3) \\) to \\( (4, 3) \\)).\n\n- **Food**:\n  - \\( (5, 5) \\): Value = +1, Life Span = 5 (will disappear at turn 68)\n  - \\( (5, 6) \\): Value = +1, Life Span = 8 (will disappear at turn 71)\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 63\n\nFrom the current head position \\( (4, 3) \\) with direction `L`, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (`U`)**: \\( (4, 4) \\)\n   - Check if \\( (4, 4) \\) is occupied: Yes, it's part of the snake's body.\n   - Cannot move here as it would cause a collision.\n\n2. **Down (`D`)**: \\( (4, 2) \\)\n   - Check if \\( (4, 2) \\) is occupied or a wall/obstacle:\n     - Not in snake positions.\n     - Not a wall (\\( x=4, y=2 \\) is within bounds).\n     - Not the obstacle at \\( (3, 2) \\).\n   - Valid move.\n\n3. **Left (`L`)**: \\( (3, 3) \\)\n   - Check if \\( (3, 3) \\) is occupied or a wall/obstacle:\n     - Not in snake positions.\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not the obstacle at \\( (3, 2) \\).\n   - Valid move.\n\n4. **Right (`R`)**: \\( (5, 3) \\)\n   - Check if \\( (5, 3) \\) is occupied:\n     - It's the segment right after the head (the first body segment).\n     - Normally, moving into the first body segment is a collision, but there's an exception if it's the tail.\n     - Here, the tail is at \\( (5, 1) \\), so \\( (5, 3) \\) is not the tail.\n   - Cannot move here as it would cause a collision.\n\nAdditionally, we cannot reverse the direction immediately. The current direction is `L`, so we cannot move `R` (right) next. However, `R` is already invalid due to collision, so this doesn't add a new constraint.\n\n### Valid Moves:\n- Down (`D`) to \\( (4, 2) \\)\n- Left (`L`) to \\( (3, 3) \\)\n\n### Evaluating the Moves\n\n**Option 1: Move Down (`D`) to \\( (4, 2) \\)**\n- New head position: \\( (4, 2) \\)\n- The body segment at \\( (5, 3) \\) will move to \\( (4, 3) \\), and so on.\n- Next possible moves from \\( (4, 2) \\):\n  - Up (`U`) to \\( (4, 3) \\): Occupied by the body segment that just moved there.\n  - Down (`D`) to \\( (4, 1) \\): Occupied by the snake's body (segment at \\( (4, 1) \\)).\n  - Left (`L`) to \\( (3, 2) \\): Obstacle at \\( (3, 2) \\).\n  - Right (`R`) to \\( (5, 2) \\): Need to check if \\( (5, 2) \\) is free.\n    - \\( (5, 2) \\) is not in the snake's current positions, not a wall, not an obstacle.\n    - Valid move.\n  \nFrom \\( (4, 2) \\), the only valid move would be `R` to \\( (5, 2) \\), which seems safe but doesn't directly lead toward the food.\n\n**Option 2: Move Left (`L`) to \\( (3, 3) \\)**\n- New head position: \\( (3, 3) \\)\n- The body segment at \\( (5, 3) \\) moves to \\( (4, 3) \\), and so on.\n- Next possible moves from \\( (3, 3) \\):\n  - Up (`U`) to \\( (3, 4) \\): Occupied by the snake's body (segment at \\( (3, 4) \\)).\n  - Down (`D`) to \\( (3, 2) \\): Obstacle at \\( (3, 2) \\).\n  - Left (`L`) to \\( (2, 3) \\): Occupied by the snake's body (segment at \\( (2, 3) \\)).\n  - Right (`R`) to \\( (4, 3) \\): Occupied by the body segment that just moved there.\n  \nFrom \\( (3, 3) \\), there are no valid moves, leading to a dead end. This is dangerous as it would trap the snake.\n\n### Considering the Previous Plan\n\nFrom the previous thinking model at turn \\( t_1 = 61 \\), the planned sequence was:\n- Turn 61: L\n- Turn 62: D\n- Turn 63: R\n- Turn 64: D\n- Turn 65: L\n\nAt turn 63, the planned move is `R`. However, as we saw, moving `R` to \\( (5, 3) \\) is invalid because it's occupied by the first body segment (not the tail). Therefore, we cannot follow this plan at turn 63.\n\n### Re-evaluating Based on Current Constraints\n\nGiven that the planned `R` move is invalid, we must choose between `D` and `L`:\n- `D` to \\( (4, 2) \\) is safe and allows future movement to \\( (5, 2) \\).\n- `L` to \\( (3, 3) \\) leads to a dead end.\n\nTherefore, the safer choice is to move `D` to \\( (4, 2) \\), even though it doesn't directly advance toward the food. This avoids immediate danger and keeps options open for future moves.\n\n### Checking for Food Accessibility\n\nThe food at \\( (5, 5) \\) and \\( (5, 6) \\) is to the right and up from the current position. Moving `D` to \\( (4, 2) \\) takes us further down, but we can potentially loop around:\n- After \\( (4, 2) \\), move `R` to \\( (5, 2) \\).\n- Then `U` to \\( (5, 3) \\), etc., to approach the food.\n\nHowever, given the snake's length and the grid's size, reaching the food in time may be challenging, especially for \\( (5, 5) \\) which disappears at turn 68 (current turn is 63). \n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the constraints and to avoid immediate danger, the best immediate action is to move down (`D`). This keeps the snake safe and allows for future maneuvering.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Here's how the snake would move in subsequent turns:\n\n1. **Turn 68**:\n   - Head at (5,1), direction L.\n   - Possible moves:\n     - Left (L): (4,1).\n     - Up (U): (5,2) → Occupied by body (from (6,2)).\n     - Down (D): (5,0) → y=0 is a wall.\n   - Only possible move: Left to (4,1).\n\n2. **Turn 69**:\n   - Head at (4,1), direction L.\n   - Possible moves:\n     - Left (L): (3,1).\n     - Up (U): (4,2) → Occupied by body.\n     - Down (D): (4,0) → y=0 is a wall.\n   - Only possible move: Left to (3,1).\n\n3. **Turn 70**:\n   - Head at (3,1), direction L.\n   - Possible moves:\n     - Left (L): (2,1).\n     - Up (U): (3,2) → Internal obstacle (wall).\n     - Down (D): (3,0) → y=0 is a wall.\n   - Only possible move: Left to (2,1).\n\n4. **Turn 71**:\n   - Head at (2,1), direction L.\n   - Possible moves:\n     - Left (L): (1,1).\n     - Up (U): (2,2).\n     - Down (D): (2,0) → y=0 is a wall.\n   - Both Left to (1,1) and Up to (2,2) are possible, but:\n     - Moving Left continues the current path.\n     - Moving Up starts to turn the snake upwards.\n\nGiven that all food disappears after Turn 67, the immediate priority is to avoid collisions and keep the snake alive. Moving Left is the only immediate safe option at Turn 67.\n\n### Special Consideration: Food Under Tail\n\nThere is positive food at (2,3), which is the current tail position. However, to eat it:\n1. The tail must move away from (2,3).\n2. The head must then move onto (2,3).\n\nGiven the current position and the fact that the head is at (6,1), it's impossible to reach (2,3) in one move. Therefore, this food cannot be eaten this turn and will disappear after Turn 67.\n\n### Conclusion for Turn 67\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities:\n- The only possible move is **Left (L) to (5,1)**.\n- No food can be eaten this turn.\n- The snake will continue moving left in subsequent turns unless new food appears.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Only U or D possible.\n   - Future planning: Need to avoid trapping the snake, but this is the only move that gives immediate reward.\n\n2. **Move U to (5, 5)** or **D to (5, 3)**:\n   - No immediate reward.\n   - Avoids growing the snake, which may help in future maneuvers (e.g., freeing (6,2) for eating later).\n   - But (6,4) food has a longer life span (6 turns), so it can be eaten later.\n\n### Risks:\n- Moving R to (6,4) grows the snake, making it harder to maneuver in the tight space (especially near the tail at (4,2)).\n- Not moving R means missing an easy +1 score, but the food at (6,4) will remain for a few more turns.\n\n### Decision:\nThe best immediate action is to **move R to (6,4)** to eat the food and maximize score, while ensuring the snake can still maneuver in future turns (e.g., by moving U or D next). The food at (6,2) is currently blocked by the snake's body and cannot be eaten immediately, so prioritizing (6,4) is optimal.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Internal obstacle at (3,2).\n- **Snake**:\n  - Positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1)]\n  - Head at (2,5), direction is Down (D).\n- **Food**:\n  - (5,2): value=1, life_span=4 (will disappear after Turn 88)\n  - (2,5): value=1, life_span=10 (will disappear after Turn 94)\n\n### Immediate Observations\n\n1. **Food at (2,5)**:\n   - The snake's head is currently at (2,5), which is also a food position.\n   - However, the food is under the head, so it can only be eaten if:\n     - The body moves away from (2,5).\n     - The head moves onto (2,5) again.\n   - Currently, the head is already on (2,5), so we cannot eat it immediately.\n\n2. **Food at (5,2)**:\n   - Manhattan distance from head (2,5) to (5,2): |5-2| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6.\n   - Life span is 4 turns (including current turn), so it will disappear after Turn 88.\n   - To eat it by Turn 88, we'd need to reach it in 3 moves (Turns 85, 86, 87), but the minimum distance is 6, which is impossible. Thus, we cannot reach this food in time.\n\n3. **Possible Moves from (2,5)**:\n   - Current direction is Down (D).\n   - Cannot reverse to Up (U) immediately.\n   - Possible moves:\n     - Left (L): (1,5)\n     - Right (R): (3,5)\n     - Down (D): (2,4)\n   - Check each:\n     - (1,5): Not a wall, not occupied by snake (snake has (2,5), (3,5), etc., but not (1,5)).\n     - (3,5): Occupied by snake's body (third segment).\n     - (2,4): Occupied by snake's body (11th segment).\n   - So, only valid move is Left (L) to (1,5).\n\n### Evaluating the Move to (1,5)\n\nIf we move Left to (1,5):\n\n- New head position: (1,5)\n- New direction: Left (L)\n- Snake's new positions: [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1)]\n  - Tail was at (4,1), now removed, new tail is (3,1).\n\nNext possible moves from (1,5), direction L:\n\n- Cannot reverse to Right (R).\n- Possible:\n  - Up (U): (1,6) - Check:\n    - (1,6): Not a wall, not occupied by snake (snake has (2,6), but not (1,6)).\n  - Down (D): (1,4) - Check:\n    - (1,4): Not a wall, not occupied by snake.\n  - Left (L): (0,5) - Wall (x=0), invalid.\n- So, possible moves from (1,5): Up to (1,6) or Down to (1,4).\n\n### Future Planning\n\nGiven that the food at (5,2) is unreachable and the food at (2,5) is under the head (cannot be eaten immediately), the priority is to avoid collisions and stay alive.\n\nMoving Left to (1,5) seems safe and opens up options to move Up or Down next. Moving Down to (1,4) might lead us towards the bottom-left corner, which could be restrictive, whereas moving Up to (1,6) keeps us near the top, potentially more open space.\n\nHowever, from (1,6), possible moves would be:\n- From (1,6), direction would be Up (if we moved U from (1,5)), but (1,7) is a wall.\n- Left to (0,6) is a wall.\n- Down to (1,5) is reverse (direction is U), not allowed.\n- Right to (2,6) is occupied by snake's body.\nSo, moving Up to (1,6) would trap us.\n\nAlternatively, moving Down to (1,4) from (1,5):\n- From (1,4), direction D.\n- Possible moves:\n  - Down to (1,3)\n  - Left to (0,4) - wall\n  - Right to (2,4) - occupied by snake\n- So, only Down to (1,3).\n\nThis path seems to lead us downward along the left wall, which is somewhat safe but may limit future options.\n\n### Alternative Consideration: Is There a Better Initial Move?\n\nFrom (2,5), the only valid move is Left to (1,5). Other moves lead to collisions or are invalid due to direction reversal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the constraints, the only immediate safe move is Left to (1,5). Subsequent moves will need to navigate carefully to avoid getting trapped.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAt Turn 85, the only valid and safe move is Left (L).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

There's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n- **Snake**:\n  - Positions (head first): [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)]\n  - Head at (1,3), direction D (down).\n- **Food**:\n  - (5,2): value=1, life_span=1\n  - (2,5): value=7, life_span=1\n  - (5,3): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's head is at (1,3), moving down (D). The possible moves from here are:\n\n1. **Down (D)**: to (1,2)\n   - Check if (1,2) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: y=2 is within playable area (y=1 to y=6).\n     - Not occupied by snake: (1,2) is not in the snake's positions.\n     - No immediate collision.\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: to (0,3)\n   - x=0 is a wall. Invalid move.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: to (2,3)\n   - Check (2,3):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Occupied by snake: (2,3) is the 15th segment in the list (index 15).\n     - Moving here would cause a collision with the body. Invalid move.\n\n4. **Up (U)**: to (1,4)\n   - Current direction is D, moving U is the opposite. \"No instant reverse\" rule applies. Invalid move.\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nAll food has a life_span of 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten. \n\n- **Food at (5,2), (2,5), (5,3)**:\n  - Distance from head (1,3):\n    - (5,2): Manhattan distance = |5-1| + |2-3| = 4 + 1 = 5\n    - (2,5): |2-1| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n    - (5,3): |5-1| + |3-3| = 4 + 0 = 4\n  - Cannot reach any food in one move. All food will disappear after this turn regardless.\n\n### Decision for Turn 88\n\nGiven the above analysis, the only valid and safe move is **Down (D)** to (1,2).\n\n### Verifying Future Moves (Optional but Good Practice)\n\nAfter moving to (1,2), the snake's new state would be:\n\n- **Head**: (1,2), direction D.\n- **Body**: (1,3), (1,4), ..., (2,3) (tail moves from (2,2) to (2,3)).\n\nPossible moves from (1,2), direction D:\n\n1. **Down (D)**: to (1,1)\n   - Valid: (1,1) is within bounds and not occupied.\n2. **Right (R)**: to (2,2)\n   - Valid: (2,2) is now free (tail was at (2,2) but moved to (2,3)).\n3. **Left (L)**: to (0,2) - wall. Invalid.\n4. **Up (U)**: opposite direction. Invalid.\n\nBoth D and R are valid, providing flexibility for future turns.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only immediate safe and valid move at Turn 88 is **Down (D)**.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

There's also an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n  \n- **Snake**:\n  - **Positions**: [(2, 3), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4)]\n    - Head at (2,3), tail at (3,4).\n  - **Direction**: The head is currently moving **Up (U)** (since the previous action at Turn 90 was U).\n\n- **Food**:\n  - (2, 5): Value = +1, Life Span = 5 (since it was 6 at Turn 90, and countdown includes current turn).\n  - (5, 3): Value = +1, Life Span = 7.\n  - (5, 1): Value = +1, Life Span = 10.\n\n### Previous Plan from Turn 90\n\nFrom the Thinking Model's output at Turn 90, the plan was:\n1. **Turn 90**: Move U to (2,3).\n2. **Turn 91**: Move R to (3,3).\n3. **Turn 92**: Move R to (4,3).\n4. **Turn 93**: Move R to (5,3) to eat the food there.\n5. **Turn 94**: Move R to (6,3).\n\nThis plan prioritizes reaching the food at (5,3) due to its longer life span and safety, avoiding the risky food at (2,5) which is under the snake's body.\n\n### Current Task at Turn 91\n\nAt Turn 91, the snake is at (2,3), having just moved U from (2,2). The next action according to the plan is to move R to (3,3). \n\nBut before executing, let's verify if this move is safe and optimal given the current state.\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 91\n\nFrom (2,3), with current direction U, the possible moves are:\n- **U (Up)**: (2,4)\n- **D (Down)**: (2,2) - This is the body segment (2,2), so moving here would cause a collision.\n- **L (Left)**: (1,3) - This is the body segment (1,3), so moving here would cause a collision.\n- **R (Right)**: (3,3)\n\nGiven the no instant reverse rule, we cannot move D (opposite of U), but even if we could, (2,2) is occupied. Similarly, L leads to a body segment. \n\nThus, the only safe moves are:\n- **U to (2,4)**\n- **R to (3,3)**\n\n### Evaluating U to (2,4)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (2,4)\n- **Body Segments**: The current body is [(2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)].\n  - Moving U to (2,4) would make the new body: [(2,3), (2,2), (1,2), ..., (4,4)], removing the tail (3,4).\n- **Adjacent Cells After Move**:\n  - From (2,4), possible next moves would be U to (2,5) (body segment), D to (2,3) (body segment), L to (1,4) (body segment), R to (3,4) (tail is removed, so free).\n  - Only R to (3,4) is safe next move.\n\nThis path seems to continue moving right, aligning with the plan to reach (5,3).\n\n### Evaluating R to (3,3)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (3,3)\n- **Body Segments**: New body would be [(2,3), (2,2), (1,2), ..., (4,4)], removing the tail (3,4).\n- **Adjacent Cells After Move**:\n  - From (3,3), possible next moves: U to (3,4) (free), D to (3,2) (wall), L to (2,3) (body), R to (4,3).\n  - Safe moves: U to (3,4), R to (4,3).\n\nThis also aligns with moving towards (5,3).\n\n### Comparing U and R Moves\n\n- **Moving U to (2,4)**:\n  - Next move would likely be R to (3,4), then R to (4,4), etc., which is less direct towards (5,3).\n  \n- **Moving R to (3,3)**:\n  - Next moves can be R to (4,3), then R to (5,3), directly reaching the food in two more turns.\n\nThus, **R to (3,3)** is more efficient for reaching (5,3).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\n- **Food at (2,5)**: Currently under the body segment (2,5). To eat it:\n  - The body must move away from (2,5), then the head must move onto it.\n  - Currently, the head is at (2,3), not adjacent to (2,5).\n  - Even if we move in a way to free (2,5), it's unlikely to be reachable before its life span ends (by Turn 95).\n\n- **Food at (5,3)**: Free and reachable in 3 moves (R to (3,3), R to (4,3), R to (5,3)).\n\nThus, prioritizing (5,3) is better.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- **Collision**: Moving R to (3,3) is safe as (3,3) is not a wall or body segment.\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: The tail is at (3,4), and food is at (2,5) and (5,3). Neither is adjacent to the tail in a way that would cause this danger.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFollowing the previous plan's guidance is optimal. The immediate action at Turn 91 should be to move **Right (R)** to (3,3), continuing the path towards the food at (5,3).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Move Right (R) to (5, 3)\n- **Pros**:\n  - Eats positive food at (5, 3), increasing score by +1 and snake length by 1.\n  - Life span of this food is 5, so it's safe to eat now.\n- **Cons**:\n  - Moving away from the food at (2, 5), which has a shorter life span (disappears after Turn 95).\n\n**After Move**:\n- New head: (5, 3)\n- New body: [(4, 3), (3, 3), ..., (5, 4)] (length increases by 1)\n- Direction after move: R\n\nFrom (5, 3), possible next moves (assuming direction is R):\n- U: (5, 4) - occupied by new tail (5, 4), but safe (tail moves away)\n- D: (5, 2) - free\n- R: (6, 3) - free\n- L: (4, 3) - body, collision\n\nSo, can continue towards other food or explore.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (4, 4)\n- **Pros**:\n  - Moves towards center, possibly opening more options.\n- **Cons**:\n  - Doesn't eat any food immediately.\n  - Risk of getting trapped if not careful.\n\n**After Move**:\n- New head: (4, 4)\n- New body: [(4, 3), (3, 3), ..., (5, 4)] (tail (5, 4) is removed)\n- Direction after move: U\n\nFrom (4, 4), possible next moves (direction U):\n- U: (4, 5) - occupied by body (4, 5), collision\n- D: (4, 3) - body, collision\n- L: (3, 4) - free\n- R: (5, 4) - free (but was tail, now free)\n\nSo, can move L or R. Moving L to (3, 4) might lead to dead ends as seen in previous analysis.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (4, 2)\n- **Pros**:\n  - Moves away from crowded areas.\n- **Cons**:\n  - Doesn't eat any food immediately.\n  - Moves towards the bottom where options might be limited.\n\n**After Move**:\n- New head: (4, 2)\n- New body: [(4, 3), (3, 3), ..., (5, 4)] (tail (5, 4) is removed)\n- Direction after move: D\n\nFrom (4, 2), possible next moves (direction D):\n- U: (4, 3) - body, collision\n- D: (4, 1) - free\n- L: (3, 2) - wall (internal obstacle)\n- R: (5, 2) - free\n\nSo, can move D or R. \n\n### Considering Food at (2, 5)\n\nThe food at (2, 5) is under the body segment (2, 5). To eat it:\n1. The body must move away from (2, 5).\n2. The head must then move to (2, 5).\n\nGiven the current body positions, the segment at (2, 5) is connected to (1, 5) before and (2, 6) after. To free (2, 5), the snake needs to move in a way that (1, 5) moves, causing (2, 5) to shift to (1, 5)'s old position.\n\nHowever, this requires complex maneuvering and may not be feasible within the remaining life span (until Turn 95). Attempting this could lead to dead ends or collisions, as seen in the previous analysis where moving towards (2, 4) trapped the snake.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the risks associated with trying to reach (2, 5) and the immediate benefit of eating the food at (5, 3), the safest and most rewarding immediate action is to move **Right (R)** to (5, 3). This:\n- Increases the score by +1.\n- Grows the snake, which can be beneficial for future moves.\n- Avoids potential traps near (2, 5).\n\nAfter this move, the snake can consider moving towards (5, 1) next, which has a longer life span and is safer to reach.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the immediate action at Turn 93 is:\n\n\\boxed{R}",
