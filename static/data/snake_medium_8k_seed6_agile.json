Possible moves:\n1. **U (Up)**: (2, 5)\n   - Check: (2, 5) is not a wall (not in borders or internal walls). Valid.\n2. **L (Left)**: (1, 4)\n   - Check: (1, 4) is not a wall. Valid.\n3. **R (Right)**: (3, 4)\n   - Check: (3, 4) is not a wall. Valid.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **U (Up) to (2, 5)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (2, 5): U, L, R (not D).\n   - From (2, 5), can go U to (2, 6), then L to (1, 6) to eat food at (1, 6) on Turn 4.\n   - This is a viable path to quickly eat food.\n\n2. **L (Left) to (1, 4)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (1, 4): U, D, L (not R).\n   - From (1, 4), can go D to (1, 3), then D to (1, 2) to eat food at (1, 2) on Turn 4.\n   - This is also a viable path to quickly eat food.\n\n3. **R (Right) to (3, 4)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (3, 4): U, D, R (not L).\n   - From (3, 4), can go R to (4, 4), then D to (4, 3), etc., but this path is longer to reach any food.\n   - Less optimal for quickly eating food.\n\n### Comparing U and L:\n- **U (Up)** leads to (2, 5), then can go U to (2, 6), then L to (1, 6) to eat (1, 6) on Turn 4.\n- **L (Left)** leads to (1, 4), then can go D to (1, 3), then D to (1, 2) to eat (1, 2) on Turn 4.\n\nBoth paths reach food in 3 moves. However:\n- (1, 6) has life_span = 8, will disappear at Turn 10.\n- (1, 2) has life_span = 9, will disappear at Turn 11.\nBoth have plenty of time, so no urgency.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- After eating (1, 6), the snake will be at (1, 6) with tail at (2, 6). Next move must be D to (1, 5) (since U is wall, L is wall, R is reverse).\n- After eating (1, 2), the snake will be at (1, 2) with tail at (1, 3). Next move must be D to (1, 1) (since U is reverse, L is wall, R is wall).\n\nBoth paths lead to valid sequences, but the path via U to (1, 6) seems slightly more straightforward as it avoids the internal wall at (2, 2) that could complicate future moves after eating (1, 2).\n\n### Decision:\nThe best immediate action is to move **Up (U)** to (2, 5), setting up to eat the food at (1, 6) in two more moves.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

It's turn 2, and the grid is 8x8 since borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls are at borders and internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: only [(2,4)], so the snake has just one segment? That must be the head. But if it's just one segment, it's only the head, so no body yet.

After eating, the tail grows, so it becomes two segments.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,4), direction Up. Since it's moving Up, from (2,4), possible moves are U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since direction is U, I cannot move Down immediately, because that would be reverse. So allowed moves: Up, Left, Right. Down is opposite to current direction, so not allowed.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders are all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.

Borders: y=7 is top, y=0 bottom, so y=5 is within 0-7, x=2 within 0-7. Internal walls: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). (2,5) not in list, so free.\n> \n> (1,4): x=1, y=4, not border, not in internal walls, so free.\n> \n> (3,4): x=3, y=4.

So to reach (1,2), need to go left and down, but cannot go down immediately.\n> \n> From (2,4), if I go Left to (1,4), then from there, I could go Down to (1,3), then Down to (1,2). But from (1,4) to (1,3) is Down, which is fine as long as not reverse from previous move.

Since snake has only one segment, there is no tail yet. After eating first food, it will have a tail, but initially, no issue.\n> \n> When snake eats food, it grows, so after eating, the tail is added, but since it was moving, the tail position depends.\n> \n> Currently, snake is only head at (2,4). When it moves to a new cell, since no body, it just moves, no tail to leave behind. If it eats food, then after moving to a food cell, it eats, and the tail grows from the previous position? I need to clarify snake growth.\n> \n> Typically in Snake, when the head moves to a food cell, it eats it, and the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn, or something. But here, the rules might specify.\n> \n> Looking back at rules: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food. And movement: each turn, the head moves to a new cell, and the body follows.\n> \n> But when snake eats, the tail doesn't move, so it grows.\n> \n> Specifically for this case: since only head, when it moves to a food cell, it eats, and the snake becomes length 2, with head at food position, and tail at previous head position.\n> \n> Then, on next moves, the tail moves accordingly.\n> \n> But for now, no body, so no collision risk except walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Also, Tail Reward Danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it causes collision because after eating, the new tail is where head was, but since head moves to tail cell, and tail was there, it might cause head to be on same cell as new tail? Let's see rule.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> So, for this to happen, there must be a tail segment with food on it, and head adjacent to that tail cell.\n> \n> But currently, no tail, so no danger.\n> \n> After eating first food, tail exists.\n> \n> But let's not worry yet.\n> \n> First, I need to eat food to grow and score points.\n> \n> All food is positive, so all good.\n> \n> Now, distances:\n> \n> To (1,2): from (2,4), Manhattan distance |2-1| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3, so at least 3 moves if no obstacles.\n> \n> Similarly, to (4,1): |2-4| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5\n> \n> To (5,3): |2-5| + |4-3| = 3 + 1 = 4\n> \n> To (1,6): |2-1| + |4-6| = 1 + 2 = 3\n> \n> (1,6) is at y=6, head at y=4, so |4-6|=2, yes.\n> \n> Life spans: all 8 or 9, current turn 2, so (5,3) life 8, disappears after 8 turns, so by turn 8+2=10? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, life span N, it disappears after N turns from now? Let's see.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at current turn t=2, for a food with life_span L, it will disappear at turn t + L, I think.\n> \n> Example: if life_span=8 at turn 2, it decreases to 7 on turn 3, to 6 on turn 4, ..., to 0 on turn 10, and disappears after that, so on turn 10 it's still there? Countdown to 0, then disappears.\n> \n> Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> I think \"after N turns\" means after N more turns, so if life_span=N at turn t, it will disappear at turn t + N.\n> \n> Because countdown decreases each turn, starting from N at turn t, to N-1 at t+1, ..., to 0 at t+N, and disappears when countdown reaches 0 or after?\n> \n> Typically, if countdown to 0, it disappears at that point.\n> \n> But let's see: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, for a food, its life_span is given, say L. Then on turn t, it has L turns left? Or L includes current?\n> \n> The rule says: \"life_span\" and \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\"\n> \n> And \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So, at the turn it is spawned, life_span N, it will disappear after N turns, meaning after N full turns from now.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, food with life_span N: it exists from turn t to turn t + N - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so on the current turn, countdown is N, and it decreases each turn, so after this turn, it becomes N-1, and so on, until when countdown is 0, it disappears, so it exists for N turns: from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> If countdown starts at N at turn t, decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, ..., to 0 at turn t+N. When countdown is 0, it is still there on turn t+N, but after that turn, it disappears, so for the turn t+N, it is present, and gone at t+N+1.\n> \n> The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", which might be ambiguous.\n> \n> But in the context, for movement, we need to know if it's there on a given turn.\n> \n> I think it's safer to assume that at turn t, with life_span L, it will be present until turn t + L - 1, and disappear at turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, if L=1 at turn t, it decreases to 0 on this turn, and disappears after, so only present on turn t.\n> \n> Similarly, if L=2, present on turn t and t+1, disappear at t+2.\n> \n> In the state, life_span is given for current turn.\n> \n> Here, at turn 2, food:\n> \n> (5,3) life_span=8, so present from turn 2 to turn 9 (since 2 to 9 is 8 turns: turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 – that's 8 turns), disappear at turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) life_span=8, same, to turn 9.\n> \n> (1,6) life_span=8, to turn 9.\n> \n> (1,2) life_span=9, so to turn 10 (turns 2 to 10, 9 turns).\n> \n> Plenty of time, all food will last at least until turn 9 or 10, current turn 2, so no urgency.\n> \n> Now, back to moves.\n> \n> I need to choose a move for turn 2.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, L, R (since D not allowed).\n> \n> If I go U to (2,5): then head at (2,5), direction U.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: U, L, R (not D).\n> \n> (2,5) to U: (2,6) – but y=6, not wall, internal walls?

However, the previous plan (from Turn 2) was to move Right (R) at Turn 3 to reach (3, 4) and eventually target the food at (5, 3). \n2. **Validity**: The move Right (R) is valid because:\n   - The snake is not reversing direction (current direction is U, and R is perpendicular).\n   - The target cell (3, 5) is not a wall or occupied by the snake's body (snake length is 1, so no body collision risk).\n3. **Alignment with Plan**: The move aligns with the long-term strategy of targeting the safer right-side food (5, 3) and avoiding the left-side dead-end risks.\n\n### Action:\n\\boxed{R}",

It's turn 2, and the grid is 8x8 since borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7).

Let's see rule.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> So, for this to happen, there must be a tail segment with food on it, and head adjacent to that tail cell.\n> \n> But currently, no tail, so no danger.\n> \n> After eating first food, tail exists.\n> \n> But let's not worry yet.\n> \n> First, I need to eat food to grow and score points.\n> \n> All food is positive, so all good.\n> \n> Now, distances:\n> \n> To (1,2): from (2,4), Manhattan distance |2-1| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3, so at least 3 moves if no obstacles.\n> \n> Similarly, to (4,1): |2-4| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5\n> \n> To (5,3): |2-5| + |4-3| = 3 + 1 = 4\n> \n> To (1,6): |2-1| + |4-6| = 1 + 2 = 3\n> \n> (1,6) is at y=6, head at y=4, so |4-6|=2, yes.\n> \n> Life spans: all 8 or 9, current turn 2, so (5,3) life 8, disappears after 8 turns, so by turn 8+2=10? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, life span N, it disappears after N turns from now? Let's see.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at current turn t=2, for a food with life_span L, it will disappear at turn t + L, I think.\n> \n> Example: if life_span=8 at turn 2, it decreases to 7 on turn 3, to 6 on turn 4, ..., to 0 on turn 10, and disappears after that, so on turn 10 it's still there? Countdown to 0, then disappears.\n> \n> Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> I think \"after N turns\" means after N more turns, so if life_span=N at turn t, it will disappear at turn t + N.\n> \n> Because countdown decreases each turn, starting from N at turn t, to N-1 at t+1, ..., to 0 at t+N, and disappears when countdown reaches 0 or after?\n> \n> Typically, if countdown to 0, it disappears at that point.\n> \n> But let's see: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, for a food, its life_span is given, say L. Then on turn t, it has L turns left? Or L includes current?\n> \n> The rule says: \"life_span\" and \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\"\n> \n> And \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So, at the turn it is spawned, life_span N, it will disappear after N turns, meaning after N full turns from now.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, food with life_span N: it exists from turn t to turn t + N - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so on the current turn, countdown is N, and it decreases each turn, so after this turn, it becomes N-1, and so on, until when countdown is 0, it disappears, so it exists for N turns: from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> If countdown starts at N at turn t, decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, ..., to 0 at turn t+N. When countdown is 0, it is still there on turn t+N, but after that turn, it disappears, so for the turn t+N, it is present, and gone at t+N+1.\n> \n> The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", which might be ambiguous.\n> \n> But in the context, for movement, we need to know if it's there on a given turn.\n> \n> I think it's safer to assume that at turn t, with life_span L, it will be present until turn t + L - 1, and disappear at turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, if L=1 at turn t, it decreases to 0 on this turn, and disappears after, so only present on turn t.\n> \n> Similarly, if L=2, present on turn t and t+1, disappear at t+2.\n> \n> In the state, life_span is given for current turn.\n> \n> Here, at turn 2, food:\n> \n> (5,3) life_span=8, so present from turn 2 to turn 9 (since 2 to 9 is 8 turns: turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 – that's 8 turns), disappear at turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) life_span=8, same, to turn 9.\n> \n> (1,6) life_span=8, to turn 9.\n> \n> (1,2) life_span=9, so to turn 10 (turns 2 to 10, 9 turns).\n> \n> Plenty of time, all food will last at least until turn 9 or 10, current turn 2, so no urgency.\n> \n> Now, back to moves.\n> \n> I need to choose a move for turn 2.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, L, R (since D not allowed).\n> \n> If I go U to (2,5): then head at (2,5), direction U.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: U, L, R (not D).\n> \n> (2,5) to U: (2,6) – but y=6, not wall, internal walls?

I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards. The current turn is t1 = 4.\n> \n> Let me understand the grid. Walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, internal obstacles at: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). I should sketch this grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid size: Since borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, that means it's an 8x8 grid, from (0,0) to (7,7). Cells from x=0 to x=7, so 8 cells wide; similarly for y.\n> \n> Snake positions: Only one position given: [(3,5)]. That means the snake has only one segment? But that doesn't make sense because if it's just the head, then it has no body. Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"Snake Positions: [(3,5)]\" – it's a list with one element. So the snake is only the head? But in Snake, when you start, you usually have a body. Perhaps this is the initial state with just the head. But the head direction is given as \"R\", right.\n> \n> Snake Head Direction: R, which is right.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (5,3) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,1) with life span 6, value 1\n> \n> - (1,6) with life span 6, value 1\n> \n> - (1,2) with life span 7, value 1\n> \n> - (2,5) with life span 10, value 1\n> \n> All food is positive, value 1, so no negative food mentioned. But the rules include negative food, but here all are value 1, so positive.\n> \n> Life span: for (5,3) it's 6, meaning it will disappear after 6 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 4, life span 6 means it will disappear after turn 9? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases each turn.\n> \n> If at turn t, a food has life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Or at turn t + L? I need to clarify.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, at turn t, if life span is N, then:\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown becomes N-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, N-2, and so on.\n> \n> - When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn? Or at the end of the turn?\n> \n> It says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns have passed, it's gone.\n> \n> For example, if at turn t, life span N, then it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappear at the start of turn t+N or something. But for simplicity, since we're planning moves, we can think in terms of remaining life.\n> \n> But for now, at turn 4:\n> \n> - (5,3): life span 6, so it will last until turn 9? Let's calculate:\n> \n> At turn 4, life span 6: after this turn, life span becomes 5; after turn 5, 4; ... after turn 9, it would be 0, so disappears after turn 9, meaning not available on turn 10. So it can be eaten from turn 4 to turn 9 inclusive? Turn 4 to turn 9 is 6 turns: turns 4,5,6,7,8,9. Yes, 6 turns.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1): life span 6, same as above.\n> \n> (1,6): life span 6, same.\n> \n> (1,2): life span 7, so until turn 10 (turns 4 to 10: 7 turns).\n> \n> (2,5): life span 10, until turn 13.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: only [(3,5)], and head direction right. So the snake has only one segment, meaning it's just the head. No body yet. So when it eats food, it will grow.\n> \n> Initially, length 1, I assume.\n> \n> Movement constraints: I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot instantly reverse. Current direction is R, so I cannot move left (L) next turn.\n> \n> Also, deadly collisions: with walls or body. But since no body yet, only walls. And walls are borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> List all wall cells:\n> \n> Border: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2)\n> \n> So forbidden cells: all border cells and these internal obstacles.\n> \n> Snake is at (3,5). Head direction R.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (3,5):\n> \n> - Up: (3,6) but (3,6) is an internal obstacle? (3,6) is listed as internal obstacle. Check: internal obstacles include (3,6), so (3,6) is a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down: (3,4) – is this a wall? Borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=4 is not border. Internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2) – none at (3,4), so (3,4) should be free.\n> \n> - Left: (2,5) – (2,5) is a food position? Food is at (2,5), but (2,5) is not a wall, unless it's an obstacle. Walls are separate. Food can be on free cells. (2,5) is listed in food, so it should be free, but there might be a wall? Internal obstacles include (2,2), but not (2,5). Borders: x=2 is not 0 or 7, y=5 not 0 or 7. So (2,5) should be free.\n> \n> But (2,5) has food, but that doesn't make it a wall. Walls are obstacles, so snake cannot move to wall cells, but can move to food cells.\n> \n> Similarly, right: (4,5) – but (4,5) is an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles include (4,5), yes, so (4,5) is a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> So from (3,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (3,6) – obstacle, invalid\n> \n> - D: (3,4) – free? y=4, not border, not in internal obstacles list: internal are (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2) – none at (3,4), so free.\n> \n> - L: (2,5) – free, and has food? Food at (2,5), but moving to it would eat it.\n> \n> - R: (4,5) – obstacle, invalid.\n> \n> Also, cannot move left because current direction is R, and L is opposite, so instant reverse not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is R, so I cannot move L on this turn (turn 4).\n> \n> Therefore, from (3,5), with dir R, possible moves are only D and R, but R to (4,5) is wall, so only possible move is Down to (3,4)? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Moves:\n> \n> - Up: (3,6) – wall, invalid\n> \n> - Down: (3,4) – seems free\n> \n> - Left: (2,5) – but instant reverse, since current dir is R, moving L is opposite, so invalid for this turn.\n> \n> - Right: (4,5) – wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is Down to (3,4).\n> \n> Is that right? Current position (3,5), head dir R.\n> \n> Moving down would be to (3,4), which is not a wall, and not reverse.\n> \n> But moving left would be reverse, which is not allowed.\n> \n> So yes, only Down is possible.\n> \n> But let me double-check the grid.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Border walls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n> \n> Internal walls: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2)\n> \n> Snake at (3,5).\n> \n> Neighbors:\n> \n> - North: (3,6) – internal wall, invalid\n> \n> - South: (3,4) – not border, not internal wall (internal walls: (3,1), (3,2), but (3,4) not listed), so free\n> \n> - West: (2,5) – not border, not internal wall (internal: (2,2), but (2,5) not), so free, but moving west is left, which is opposite to current right direction, so invalid due to no instant reverse.\n> \n> - East: (4,5) – internal wall, invalid.\n> \n> Thus, only possible move is South/Down to (3,4).\n> \n> So for turn 4, I must move Down to (3,4).\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead, and plan a sequence.\n> \n> After moving down, snake will be at (3,4), and direction will be down, since I moved down.\n> \n> Then on next turns, I can plan.\n> \n> But let's list the food positions again:\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (5,3) : value 1, life span 6, so available turns 4 to 9\n> \n> - (4,1) : value 1, life span 6, turns 4 to 9\n> \n> - (1,6) : value 1, life span 6, turns 4 to 9\n> \n> - (1,2) : value 1, life span 7, turns 4 to 10\n> \n> - (2,5) : value 1, life span 10, turns 4 to 13\n> \n> At turn 4, snake is at (3,5), moving to (3,4).\n> \n> After move, on turn 5, snake position: since it ate no food, length still 1, so head at (3,4), no body.\n> \n> When it moves, since no food eaten, it doesn't grow, so positions: after moving to (3,4), the snake is now at [(3,4)], since only head.\n> \n> Then on turn 5, from (3,4), direction down (since I moved down).\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,4):\n> \n> - Up: (3,5) – just came from there, but is it free?

Let's see if this is still the best option.\n\n**Option 1: Move `L` to `(2, 4)`**\n- Next turn (turn 6), from `(2, 4)` with direction `L`, can move `U` to `(2, 5)` to eat the food.\n- `(2, 5)` has a long life span (until turn 13), so no urgency.\n- After eating `(2, 5)`, the snake would be at `[(2, 5), (2, 4)]` with direction `U`.\n- Then can move `U` to `(2, 6)` or `L` to `(1, 5)` to approach `(1, 6)`.\n\n**Option 2: Move `D` to `(3, 3)`**\n- Next turn (turn 6), from `(3, 3)` with direction `D`, can move `L` to `(2, 3)` or `R` to `(4, 3)`.\n- `(3, 2)` is a wall, so cannot move further down.\n- This path doesn't immediately lead to any food, but could be used to reach `(4, 1)` or `(1, 2)` later.\n\n**Option 3: Move `R` to `(4, 4)`**\n- Next turn (turn 6), from `(4, 4)` with direction `R`, can move `U` to `(4, 5)` (but `(4, 5)` is a wall), `D` to `(4, 3)`, or `R` to `(5, 4)`.\n- Moving `R` to `(5, 4)` sets up to reach `(5, 3)` at turn 7.\n- `(5, 3)` has a shorter life span (until turn 9), so this is more urgent.\n\n### Prioritizing Food with Short Life Span:\n\nFoods `(5, 3)`, `(4, 1)`, and `(1, 6)` disappear after turn 9, so they should be prioritized over `(2, 5)` and `(1, 2)`.\n\n- `(5, 3)`: Can be reached by moving `R` to `(4, 4)` at turn 5, then `R` to `(5, 4)` at turn 6, then `D` to `(5, 3)` at turn 7.\n- `(4, 1)`: Can be reached by moving `D` to `(3, 3)` at turn 5, then `R` to `(4, 3)` at turn 6, then `D` to `(4, 2)` at turn 7, then `D` to `(4, 1)` at turn 8.\n- `(1, 6)`: Can be reached by moving `L` to `(2, 4)` at turn 5, then `L` to `(1, 4)` at turn 6, then `U` to `(1, 5)` at turn 7, then `U` to `(1, 6)` at turn 8.\n\nThe most efficient seems to be moving `R` to `(4, 4)` to reach `(5, 3)` by turn 7, as it's the earliest we can eat one of the short-life foods.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food:\n\nIs there any food adjacent to `(3, 4)` that can be eaten immediately?\n- `(5, 3)`: Not adjacent (distance of 2).\n- `(4, 1)`: Not adjacent.\n- `(1, 6)`: Not adjacent.\n- `(1, 2)`: Not adjacent.\n- `(2, 5)`: Not adjacent.\n\nNo immediate food to eat, so we must plan a path.\n\n### Decision:\n\nGiven the urgency of `(5, 3)`, `(4, 1)`, and `(1, 6)` disappearing after turn 9, and `(5, 3)` being reachable by turn 7, the best immediate move is `R` to `(4, 4)`.\n\n### Verifying Collisions and Safety:\n\n- Moving `R` to `(4, 4)`:\n  - `(4, 4)` is not a wall and not occupied by the snake's body (snake length is 1, so no body).\n  - No risk of collision.\n  - Direction after move will be `R`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.

I should sketch this grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid size: Since borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, that means it's an 8x8 grid, from (0,0) to (7,7). Cells from x=0 to x=7, so 8 cells wide; similarly for y.\n> \n> Snake positions: Only one position given: [(3,5)]. That means the snake has only one segment? But that doesn't make sense because if it's just the head, then it has no body. Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"Snake Positions: [(3,5)]\" – it's a list with one element. So the snake is only the head? But in Snake, when you start, you usually have a body. Perhaps this is the initial state with just the head. But the head direction is given as \"R\", right.\n> \n> Snake Head Direction: R, which is right.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (5,3) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,1) with life span 6, value 1\n> \n> - (1,6) with life span 6, value 1\n> \n> - (1,2) with life span 7, value 1\n> \n> - (2,5) with life span 10, value 1\n> \n> All food is positive, value 1, so no negative food mentioned. But the rules include negative food, but here all are value 1, so positive.\n> \n> Life span: for (5,3) it's 6, meaning it will disappear after 6 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 4, life span 6 means it will disappear after turn 9? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases each turn.\n> \n> If at turn t, a food has life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Or at turn t + L? I need to clarify.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, at turn t, if life span is N, then:\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown becomes N-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, N-2, and so on.\n> \n> - When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn? Or at the end of the turn?\n> \n> It says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns have passed, it's gone.\n> \n> For example, if at turn t, life span N, then it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappear at the start of turn t+N or something. But for simplicity, since we're planning moves, we can think in terms of remaining life.\n> \n> But for now, at turn 4:\n> \n> - (5,3): life span 6, so it will last until turn 9? Let's calculate:\n> \n> At turn 4, life span 6: after this turn, life span becomes 5; after turn 5, 4; ... after turn 9, it would be 0, so disappears after turn 9, meaning not available on turn 10. So it can be eaten from turn 4 to turn 9 inclusive? Turn 4 to turn 9 is 6 turns: turns 4,5,6,7,8,9. Yes, 6 turns.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1): life span 6, same as above.\n> \n> (1,6): life span 6, same.\n> \n> (1,2): life span 7, so until turn 10 (turns 4 to 10: 7 turns).\n> \n> (2,5): life span 10, until turn 13.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: only [(3,5)], and head direction right. So the snake has only one segment, meaning it's just the head. No body yet. So when it eats food, it will grow.\n> \n> Initially, length 1, I assume.\n> \n> Movement constraints: I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot instantly reverse. Current direction is R, so I cannot move left (L) next turn.\n> \n> Also, deadly collisions: with walls or body. But since no body yet, only walls. And walls are borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> List all wall cells:\n> \n> Border: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2)\n> \n> So forbidden cells: all border cells and these internal obstacles.\n> \n> Snake is at (3,5). Head direction R.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (3,5):\n> \n> - Up: (3,6) but (3,6) is an internal obstacle? (3,6) is listed as internal obstacle. Check: internal obstacles include (3,6), so (3,6) is a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down: (3,4) – is this a wall? Borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=4 is not border. Internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2) – none at (3,4), so (3,4) should be free.\n> \n> - Left: (2,5) – (2,5) is a food position? Food is at (2,5), but (2,5) is not a wall, unless it's an obstacle. Walls are separate. Food can be on free cells. (2,5) is listed in food, so it should be free, but there might be a wall? Internal obstacles include (2,2), but not (2,5). Borders: x=2 is not 0 or 7, y=5 not 0 or 7. So (2,5) should be free.\n> \n> But (2,5) has food, but that doesn't make it a wall. Walls are obstacles, so snake cannot move to wall cells, but can move to food cells.\n> \n> Similarly, right: (4,5) – but (4,5) is an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles include (4,5), yes, so (4,5) is a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> So from (3,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (3,6) – obstacle, invalid\n> \n> - D: (3,4) – free? y=4, not border, not in internal obstacles list: internal are (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2) – none at (3,4), so free.\n> \n> - L: (2,5) – free, and has food? Food at (2,5), but moving to it would eat it.\n> \n> - R: (4,5) – obstacle, invalid.\n> \n> Also, cannot move left because current direction is R, and L is opposite, so instant reverse not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is R, so I cannot move L on this turn (turn 4).\n> \n> Therefore, from (3,5), with dir R, possible moves are only D and R, but R to (4,5) is wall, so only possible move is Down to (3,4)? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Moves:\n> \n> - Up: (3,6) – wall, invalid\n> \n> - Down: (3,4) – seems free\n> \n> - Left: (2,5) – but instant reverse, since current dir is R, moving L is opposite, so invalid for this turn.\n> \n> - Right: (4,5) – wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is Down to (3,4).\n> \n> Is that right? Current position (3,5), head dir R.\n> \n> Moving down would be to (3,4), which is not a wall, and not reverse.\n> \n> But moving left would be reverse, which is not allowed.\n> \n> So yes, only Down is possible.\n> \n> But let me double-check the grid.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Border walls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n> \n> Internal walls: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2)\n> \n> Snake at (3,5).\n> \n> Neighbors:\n> \n> - North: (3,6) – internal wall, invalid\n> \n> - South: (3,4) – not border, not internal wall (internal walls: (3,1), (3,2), but (3,4) not listed), so free\n> \n> - West: (2,5) – not border, not internal wall (internal: (2,2), but (2,5) not), so free, but moving west is left, which is opposite to current right direction, so invalid due to no instant reverse.\n> \n> - East: (4,5) – internal wall, invalid.\n> \n> Thus, only possible move is South/Down to (3,4).\n> \n> So for turn 4, I must move Down to (3,4).\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead, and plan a sequence.\n> \n> After moving down, snake will be at (3,4), and direction will be down, since I moved down.\n> \n> Then on next turns, I can plan.\n> \n> But let's list the food positions again:\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (5,3) : value 1, life span 6, so available turns 4 to 9\n> \n> - (4,1) : value 1, life span 6, turns 4 to 9\n> \n> - (1,6) : value 1, life span 6, turns 4 to 9\n> \n> - (1,2) : value 1, life span 7, turns 4 to 10\n> \n> - (2,5) : value 1, life span 10, turns 4 to 13\n> \n> At turn 4, snake is at (3,5), moving to (3,4).\n> \n> After move, on turn 5, snake position: since it ate no food, length still 1, so head at (3,4), no body.\n> \n> When it moves, since no food eaten, it doesn't grow, so positions: after moving to (3,4), the snake is now at [(3,4)], since only head.\n> \n> Then on turn 5, from (3,4), direction down (since I moved down).\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,4):\n> \n> - Up: (3,5) – just came from there, but is it free?

Turn 4 now, food available turns 4,5,6,7,8,9 for life span 6.\n> \n> At turn 4, if I don't eat, they last until turn 9.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) until turn 10, (2,5) until turn 13.\n> \n> Now, turn 4: I must move to (3,4).\n> \n> Turn 5: from (3,4), dir down.\n> \n> I need to plan sequence for 5+ turns: turns 5,6,7,8,9.\n> \n> Let's list possible paths.\n> \n> Option 1: Go for (2,5) first.\n> \n> Turn 5: move L to (2,4)\n> \n> Then turn 6: move U to (2,5) — eat food, grow to length 2, positions: head (2,5), body (2,4)\n> \n> Direction now up.\n> \n> Then from (2,5), I can move to other places.\n> \n> But (2,5) has walls nearby?

When moving from (1,5) to (1,6), head to (1,6), and since eat, grow, so body: previous head (1,5) and the tail (2,5) or? Let's trace.\n> \n> After turn 6: snake at [(2,5), (2,4)] head at (2,5)\n> \n> Turn 7: move to (1,5) — no food at (1,5), I assume? Food positions given, (1,5) not listed, so no food. So move to (1,5), head to (1,5), tail moves away from (2,4), so positions: head (1,5), body (2,5) — since tail was (2,4), but when head moves to (1,5), the body follows: the segment that was at (2,5) moves to where head was? Standard snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves, head to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So at turn 6: positions [(2,5), (2,4)] head (2,5), tail (2,4)\n> \n> Turn 7: move to (1,5), head to (1,5), then body: the segment that was at (2,5) moves to where head was, but head was at (2,5), now moving to (1,5), so the body segment at (2,5) moves to (1,5)? No.\n> \n> Positions: let's index.\n> \n> At end of turn 6: segment 0 (head) at (2,5), segment 1 (tail) at (2,4)\n> \n> Now turn 7: move head to new position, say (1,5). Then segment 0 moves to (1,5), and segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was, which is (2,5).\n> \n> So new positions: head at (1,5), tail at (2,5).\n> \n> Since no food eaten, length same.\n> \n> Then turn 8: from (1,5), move U to (1,6) — which has food, so eat. Head moves to (1,6), and since eat, a new segment is added at the tail position before move? When you eat, the tail doesn't move, so you grow.\n> \n> After moving to (1,6), head at (1,6), and new segment added at the previous tail position, so previous tail was at (2,5), so now segments: head (1,6), then (1,5), then (2,5)? Let's see.\n> \n> Before move, positions: head (1,5), tail (2,5)\n> \n> Move head to (1,6): head moves to (1,6), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so tail stays at (2,5), and the body segment at (1,5) remains? No.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to a cell with food, the head occupies that cell, and a new body segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move, effectively growing.\n> \n> So before move: segments [A, B] with A head at (1,5), B tail at (2,5)\n> \n> After moving head to (1,6) and eating: new head at (1,6), and a new segment added, so now segments [C, A, B] with C at (1,6), A at (1,5)? No.\n> \n> The segments: the new head is at the new position (1,6), the previous head becomes the first body segment, and the tail remains, plus a new segment is added at the tail position, but since tail doesn't move, it's extended.\n> \n> Typically, the snake grows by keeping the tail in place for that turn.\n> \n> So positions: before move: head at (1,5), tail at (2,5)\n> \n> After move: head moves to (1,6), the body segment that was at (1,5) stays, but since head moved, it becomes body, and tail at (2,5) stays because of growth? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Better to think: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> When eat, head moves to new cell, body segments move as usual, but a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so the tail doesn't leave, length increases.\n> \n> In this case, before move at turn 7 end: positions [(1,5), (2,5)] with head (1,5)\n> \n> Turn 8: move to (1,6), which has food.\n> \n> So head moves to (1,6), the body segment at (1,5) moves to where head was, but head was at (1,5), now moving, so the first body segment moves to (1,5)? No.\n> \n> List positions:\n> \n> At time t, positions: P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., Pk (tail)\n> \n> Move to new head position N.\n> \n> If no eat, new positions: N, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}  (tail was Pk, it moves to P_{k-1} position? No.\n> \n> When head moves to N, the new head is N, and each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So new position 0: N\n> \n> Position 1: old position 0\n> \n> Position 2: old position 1\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Position k: old position k-1\n> \n> And old position k is vacated.\n> \n> If eat, then new position 0: N\n> \n> Position 1: old position 0\n> \n> Position 2: old position 1\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Position k: old position k-1\n> \n> Position k+1: old position k  (new segment added at old tail position)\n> \n> So tail doesn't move, length increases.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> Before turn 8 move: positions: index 0 (head) at (1,5), index 1 (tail) at (2,5)\n> \n> Move to (1,6) with eat.\n> \n> New positions: index 0 (head) at (1,6)\n> \n> Index 1: old index 0 at (1,5)\n> \n> Index 2: old index 1 at (2,5)  // new segment added\n> \n> So snake: [(1,6), (1,5), (2,5)] head at (1,6), tail at (2,5)\n> \n> Direction: since moved up to (1,6), dir up.\n> \n> Back to planning.\n> \n> For turn 5, from (3,4) dir down, I can choose to go L to (2,4) to approach (2,5).\n> \n> Then turn 6: move U to (2,5) eat, grow to length 2, positions head (2,5), body (2,4)  // since initially only head at (2,4) before move?

So possible: U, D, R.\n- **Obstacles**:\n  - U: (4,5) is an internal obstacle → cannot move U.\n  - D: (4,3) is free (no wall or obstacle).\n  - R: (5,4) is free (no wall or obstacle).\n\nThus, the only valid immediate moves are **D (down)** or **R (right)**.\n\n### Food Considerations:\n- Closest food is (5,3) (distance 2: right then down or down then right).\n- (5,3) has life span 4 (disappears after turn 9), so we have until turn 9 to eat it.\n- Other food is farther away and not immediately reachable in one move.\n\n### Decision:\nBoth D and R allow us to reach (5,3) on turn 7. However:\n- Moving **R to (5,4)** first aligns with the current direction and sets up a straightforward path to (5,3) on turn 7.\n- Moving **D to (4,3)** also allows reaching (5,3) on turn 7, but this path is less direct and may complicate future movements (e.g., accessing other food like (4,1)).\n\n### Optimal Immediate Action:\nChoose **R (right)** to (5,4) to maintain alignment with the current direction and simplify the path to (5,3).

It's turn 6, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The walls are defined: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), and (2,2). So I need to avoid those cells.\n> \n> The snake positions are given as [(4,4)], but that can't be right because a snake should have multiple segments. Let me read carefully: \"Snake Positions: [(4,4)]\" – that says only one position, which must be the head. But a snake has a body. Perhaps it's a single segment snake? The food mechanics mention that eating positive food increases length, so at this point, the snake might be just the head, meaning length 1.\n> \n> Confirming: \"Snake Positions: [(4,4)]\" and it's a list with one element, so yes, the snake is only the head at (4,4). That means no body segments yet, so no risk of body collision except for walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Head direction is R, so moving right.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,3) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (1,2) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food.

So on turn 6, life span 4 means it will disappear after turn 9? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The life span decreases every turn, including the current turn. So for a food with life span N at turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1? Or at the start of turn t + N?\n> \n> It says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, when it's present, life span is N. After the turn, life span becomes N-1, and so on. When life span reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span L, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, at turn 6, (5,3) has life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 6+4-1=9?

Since it's only the head, I can move in any direction except possibly opposite, but since no body, moving opposite might be allowed?

No, (5,3) is right and down, but not adjacent directly. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (4,4) adjacent are (4,5), (4,3), (3,4), (5,4).\n> \n> (5,3) is not adjacent to (4,4); it's one step right and one step down, so I need two moves to get there.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (4,1) is down, but (4,1) is at y=1, from (4,4) down to (4,3), then (4,2), then (4,1), so three moves down.\n> \n> (1,6) is far left and up, but up is blocked at (4,5), so need to go around.\n> \n> (1,2) is left and down.\n> \n> (2,5) is left and up, but up blocked.\n> \n> First, for turn 6, I have to choose between D to (4,3) or R to (5,4).\n> \n> Now, let's see what food I can reach.\n> \n> If I go right to (5,4):\n> \n> - Then at (5,4), head direction now R (if I moved R).\n> \n> Then from (5,4), I can go U, D, L, R.

Then snake grows to length 2. Head at (5,3), tail at (4,4)? When I move to the food, I eat it, so at the end of the move, head is at (5,3), and since I ate, the tail is added, so positions: head (5,3), tail (4,4). Then when I move next, the tail will stay or move?

No, because the tail is moving away.\n> \n> Standard: positions list: let's say positions: index 0: head, index 1: tail.\n> \n> After moving head to new position, the tail moves to where the head was, but since it's a list, we pop the last and add new head.\n> \n> So from [(5,3), (5,4)] - head (5,3), body (5,4).\n> \n> Move head to (5,4): but (5,4) is occupied by body, so if I move head there, it collides with body, but the rule says you can move to tail cell because tail moves.\n> \n> Specifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, moving to (5,4) which is tail, so it should be ok; after move, head is at (5,4), and the tail segment is removed or moved?

New head position is (5,4).\n> \n> Then, the body segments: the segment that was at index 1 (tail) needs to move to where the previous segment was, but since head moved, the new body should be at the old head position? Standard algorithm: new head at (5,4), and the tail is removed, so new positions are [ (5,4), (5,3) ]? No.\n> \n> When you move without eating, you remove the tail and add new head.\n> \n> So from [ (5,3), (5,4) ], move head to new position, say new_pos.\n> \n> Then new positions: [ new_pos, (5,3) ] and the (5,4) is removed.\n> \n> If new_pos is (5,4), which is the same as the current tail, then new positions: [ (5,4), (5,3) ]\n> \n> So head at (5,4), tail at (5,3).

Let me read carefully: \"Snake Positions: [(4,4)]\" – that says only one position, which must be the head. But a snake has a body. Perhaps it's a single segment snake? The food mechanics mention that eating positive food increases length, so at this point, the snake might be just the head, meaning length 1.\n> \n> Confirming: \"Snake Positions: [(4,4)]\" and it's a list with one element, so yes, the snake is only the head at (4,4).

So on turn 6, life span 4 means it will disappear after turn 9? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The life span decreases every turn, including the current turn. So for a food with life span N at turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1? Or at the start of turn t + N?\n> \n> It says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, when it's present, life span is N.

No, typically in snake, when you eat, the tail grows, so after eating, the snake has two segments: head and tail at the food position, but then when you move, the tail stays or moves?\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when snake eats, it grows, so the next time it moves, the tail doesn't move, so it gets longer.\n> \n> But here, since it's only head, if I move to a food cell, I eat it, and then the snake becomes two segments: head at the food position, and tail at the previous head position? Let's think.\n> \n> At turn 6, snake is at (4,4). If I move to (5,4), which is not food, then snake moves to (5,4), still length 1.\n> \n> If I move to (4,3), which is not food, same.\n> \n> Now, (5,3) is food, but I'm at (4,4), so to go to (5,3), I need to move down-right or something, but I can only move one cell per turn in U/D/L/R.\n> \n> From (4,4), I can only move to adjacent: (4,5) blocked, (4,3) down, (3,4) left not allowed, (5,4) right.\n> \n> (5,3) is not adjacent to (4,4); it's diagonally? No, (5,3) is right and down, but not adjacent directly. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (4,4) adjacent are (4,5), (4,3), (3,4), (5,4).\n> \n> (5,3) is not adjacent to (4,4); it's one step right and one step down, so I need two moves to get there.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (4,1) is down, but (4,1) is at y=1, from (4,4) down to (4,3), then (4,2), then (4,1), so three moves down.\n> \n> (1,6) is far left and up, but up is blocked at (4,5), so need to go around.\n> \n> (1,2) is left and down.\n> \n> (2,5) is left and up, but up blocked.\n> \n> First, for turn 6, I have to choose between D to (4,3) or R to (5,4).\n> \n> Now, let's see what food I can reach.\n> \n> If I go right to (5,4):\n> \n> - Then at (5,4), head direction now R (if I moved R).\n> \n> Then from (5,4), I can go U, D, L, R. But current direction R, so cannot move L? After moving R, direction is R, so for next turn, cannot move L.\n> \n> Adjacent cells:\n> \n> - U: (5,5) - free? x=5,y=5, borders ok, no internal obstacle, yes.\n> \n> - D: (5,3) - which is food! (5,3) has food with value 1.\n> \n> - L: (4,4) - but cannot move L because opposite to current direction R.\n> \n> - R: (6,4) - free.\n> \n> So from (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3), R to (6,4).\n> \n> If I go down to (5,3), I eat the food, since (5,3) is food. Then snake grows to length 2. Head at (5,3), tail at (4,4)? When I move to the food, I eat it, so at the end of the move, head is at (5,3), and since I ate, the tail is added, so positions: head (5,3), tail (4,4). Then when I move next, the tail will stay or move? In snake, when you move, the tail follows, so if I move from (5,3) to somewhere, tail moves to (5,3) or something.\n> \n> Standard: after eating, when you move next, the tail doesn't move, so snake extends.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> - Turn 6: start at (4,4), move to (5,4) - not food, so snake now at (5,4), length 1.\n> \n> - Or move to (4,3) - not food, snake at (4,3), length 1.\n> \n> But (5,3) is food, so if I can get to (5,3) in one move from (4,4), but I can't; it's not adjacent.\n> \n> From (4,4), to (5,3) requires moving down then right or right then down, but in separate turns.\n> \n> For example, if I go down to (4,3) on turn 6, then from (4,3), I can go to (5,3) on turn 7.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go right to (5,4) on turn 6, then down to (5,3) on turn 7.\n> \n> Now, life span of (5,3) is 4 at turn 6, so after turn 6, life span 3, still present on turn 7.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Also, since snake is short, no body collision risk yet.\n> \n> But tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but tail doesn't have food; food is on separate cells.\n> \n> Food can be under body, but currently no body.\n> \n> So let's plan.\n> \n> I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> First, option 1: Move R to (5,4) on turn 6.\n> \n> Then at (5,4), direction R.\n> \n> On turn 7, I can move D to (5,3) to eat food, or U to (5,5), or R to (6,4).\n> \n> If I move D to (5,3), eat food: head to (5,3), tail at (5,4)? When I move to (5,3), I eat, so after move, head at (5,3), and new segment added, so body is [(5,3), (5,4)]? Positions: head was at (5,4) before move? No.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> Turn 6: move from (4,4) to (5,4) - no food, so snake now at (5,4), length 1.\n> \n> Turn 7: move from (5,4) to (5,3) - (5,3) has food, so I eat it. After eating, the snake grows: head moves to (5,3), and a new segment is added at the previous position, which was (5,4), so now snake positions: head (5,3), tail (5,4), length 2.\n> \n> Direction now D, since I moved down.\n> \n> Then on turn 8, I can move from (5,3). Possible moves: U to (5,4), but (5,4) is the tail; D to (5,2); L to (4,3); R to (6,3).\n> \n> Now, moving to (5,4): (5,4) is the tail, but in snake, when you move, the tail also moves, so if I move to (5,4), which is the current tail, but after I move, the tail will move away, so it might be ok, but let's see the rule.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> But here, (5,4) is the tail, and it doesn't have food; the food was at (5,3), which I ate, so (5,4) is just body.\n> \n> After I ate at (5,3), the food is gone, so (5,4) has no food.\n> \n> So moving to (5,4) is moving to the tail cell, which is allowed because the tail will move.\n> \n> But when I move to (5,4), what happens?\n> \n> Current positions: head (5,3), tail (5,4)\n> \n> I move head to (5,4) - but (5,4) is occupied by tail, but since the tail will move, it's ok.\n> \n> After move: head moves to (5,4), and since I didn't eat, the tail moves to the next position, but there is no next; the body is only two segments.\n> \n> When snake moves, if no eat, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So from [head: (5,3), tail: (5,4)], if I move head to (5,4), but (5,4) is where tail is, so it would be collision? No, because the tail is moving away.\n> \n> Standard: positions list: let's say positions: index 0: head, index 1: tail.\n> \n> After moving head to new position, the tail moves to where the head was, but since it's a list, we pop the last and add new head.\n> \n> So from [(5,3), (5,4)] - head (5,3), body (5,4).\n> \n> Move head to (5,4): but (5,4) is occupied by body, so if I move head there, it collides with body, but the rule says you can move to tail cell because tail moves.\n> \n> Specifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, moving to (5,4) which is tail, so it should be ok; after move, head is at (5,4), and the tail segment is removed or moved? When you move, the tail moves to the position that was the head's previous position.\n> \n> So from positions [(5,3), (5,4)], if I move head to (5,4), the new head position is (5,4), and the tail was at (5,4), but since head moves to (5,4), and tail needs to move to where head was, (5,3), but (5,3) is now empty, so new positions: head at (5,4), and tail at (5,3)? Let's think.\n> \n> Typically, in snake movement: the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list. The tail segment is removed, but since we grew, it's different.\n> \n> After eating at turn 7, snake is at [(5,3), (5,4)] - head (5,3), tail (5,4).\n> \n> Now turn 8, I move head to a new position.\n> \n> If I move to (5,4), which is the current tail position.\n> \n> After moving head to (5,4), the new head is at (5,4). Now, for the body, the segment that was at (5,3) moves to where? The body segments follow: the first body segment (which was head) moves to the new position, but it's messy.\n> \n> Better to think of the positions list.\n> \n> Before move: positions: [ (5,3), (5,4) ]  # index 0: head, index 1: tail\n> \n> I move head to (5,4). New head position is (5,4).\n> \n> Then, the body segments: the segment that was at index 1 (tail) needs to move to where the previous segment was, but since head moved, the new body should be at the old head position? Standard algorithm: new head at (5,4), and the tail is removed, so new positions are [ (5,4), (5,3) ]? No.\n> \n> When you move without eating, you remove the tail and add new head.\n> \n> So from [ (5,3), (5,4) ], move head to new position, say new_pos.\n> \n> Then new positions: [ new_pos, (5,3) ] and the (5,4) is removed.\n> \n> If new_pos is (5,4), which is the same as the current tail, then new positions: [ (5,4), (5,3) ]\n> \n> So head at (5,4), tail at (5,3). No problem, no collision.\n> \n> And (5,4) was tail, but now it's head, and tail is at (5,3).\n> \n> So it's safe.\n> \n> If I move to other places.\n> \n> Back to planning.\n> \n> Option: turn 6 move R to (5,4)\n> \n> Then turn 7 move D to (5,3) to eat food.

        "thinking": "Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the best immediate action for the current turn \\( t_0 = 8 \\).\n\n### Current State:\n- **Snake Positions**: Head at (5, 3), tail at (5, 4).\n- **Head Direction**: Down (D).\n- **Possible Moves**: Cannot reverse (cannot move Up (U)), so possible moves are Down (D), Left (L), Right (R).\n- **Food**: All food is positive (+1), with varying life spans. The closest food is (4, 1) and (1, 6), but they expire soon (by turn 10). Other food is further away but lasts longer.\n\n### Immediate Possible Moves:\n1. **Down (D) to (5, 2)**:\n   - Check if (5, 2) is valid: Not a wall or obstacle, and not the snake's body (tail is at (5, 4)).\n   - After moving, snake will be [(5, 2), (5, 3)].\n   - From (5, 2), next possible moves: D to (5, 1), L to (4, 2), R to (6, 2).\n\n2. **Left (L) to (4, 3)**:\n   - Check if (4, 3) is valid: Not a wall or obstacle, and not the snake's body.\n   - After moving, snake will be [(4, 3), (5, 3)].\n   - From (4, 3), next possible moves: L to (3, 3), U to (4, 4), D to (4, 2).\n\n3. **Right (R) to (6, 3)**:\n   - Check if (6, 3) is valid: Not a wall (x=7 is wall, x=6 is playable), not an obstacle, and not the snake's body.\n   - After moving, snake will be [(6, 3), (5, 3)].\n   - From (6, 3), next possible moves: U to (6, 4), D to (6, 2) (cannot move R to (7, 3) as it's a wall).\n\n### Food Considerations:\n- **(4, 1)**: Expires by turn 10. To eat it, must be at (4, 1) by turn 9. From current position, cannot reach it in time (as analyzed in the guidance).\n- **(1, 6)**: Expires by turn 10. Too far to reach in time.\n- **(1, 2)**: Expires by turn 11. Can be reached by turn 10 with a sequence of moves (e.g., L to (4, 3), then L to (3, 3), then L to (2, 3), then L to (1, 3), then D to (1, 2) on turn 10).\n- **(2, 5) and (1, 1)**: Longer life spans, can be targeted later.\n\n### Best Immediate Action:\nGiven that (1, 2) is the most reachable food before it expires, the best immediate action is to start moving towards it. The sequence would involve moving left initially to get closer to (1, 2).\n\nThus, the immediate action should be **Left (L)** to (4, 3).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{L}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 8 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(3, 2), (4, 5), (3, 6), (3, 1), (2, 2)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(5, 3), (5, 4)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: D\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (4, 1, 2, 1)\n\t- (1, 6, 2, 1)\n\t- (1, 2, 3, 1)\n\t- (2, 5, 6, 1)\n\t- (1, 1, 9, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 8 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 8, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think, because walls are at the borders. Let me confirm: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid cells are from (1,1) to (6,6). Yes.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). I should list all obstacles to avoid.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,3), body at (5,4). Since head direction is down, and positions are given head first, so head is (5,3), tail is (5,4). Moving down means decreasing y, so from (5,4) to (5,3) was moving down, which matches the direction D.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (4,1) with life span 2, value +1\n> \n> - (1,6) with life span 2, value +1\n> \n> - (1,2) with life span 3, value +1\n> \n> - (2,5) with life span 6, value +1\n> \n> - (1,1) with life span 9, value +1\n> \n> All food is positive, value +1, no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, including current turn. So at turn 8, life span is given, so for (4,1), life span 2 means it will disappear after 2 more turns? Let me read: \"life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it will be gone at the start of turn t+L or something? I need to be careful.\n> \n> Typically, if countdown decreases every turn including current, and disappears after N turns, that means it has N turns left including the current one. So for food at turn t with life span L, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, (4,1) has life span 2 at turn 8, so it will be present on turn 8 and 9, disappear at turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6) life span 2: present turn 8,9, gone turn 10.\n> \n> (1,2) life span 3: present turn 8,9,10, gone turn 11.\n> \n> (2,5) life span 6: present turn 8 to 13, gone turn 14.\n> \n> (1,1) life span 9: present turn 8 to 16, gone turn 17.\n> \n> Snake is at (5,3) head, (5,4) tail. Head direction down, so last move was down to (5,3).\n> \n> Possible moves: I can go U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Current direction is D, so I cannot move U (up) immediately, because that would be opposite to down. So allowed moves are D (down), L (left), R (right). Not U.\n> \n> Now, the grid: let me sketch a mental map.\n> \n> Grid from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, so we can only be on (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2)\n> \n> So let's list all blocked cells:\n> \n> - (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (4,5), (3,6)\n> \n> (3,1) and (3,6) are obstacles.\n> \n> Snake: head (5,3), tail (5,4)\n> \n> Food: (4,1), (1,6), (1,2), (2,5), (1,1)\n> \n> Now, I need to plan 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's see where I can move from (5,3).\n> \n> Possible actions:\n> \n> - D (down): to (5,2) — y decreases? Direction: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n> \n> In standard coordinates, y=0 might be bottom or top? But here, since head direction is D, and it was at (5,4) before, which is higher y, and moved to (5,3), so y decreases when moving down. So probably y=1 is bottom or top? Doesn't matter, but for consistency, let's assume (1,1) is bottom-left, so moving down decreases y.\n> \n> In the movement constraints: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so y increases up, decreases down. So (1,1) is bottom-left, (1,6) is top-left, etc.\n> \n> But walls at y=0 and y=7, so y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Similarly x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Head at (5,3).

(5,2) not in list, so free.\n> \n> - L: left to (4,3) — x=4,y=3. Not in obstacles, and not wall, should be free.\n> \n> - R: right to (6,3) — x=6,y=3. x=6 is not wall?

It's turn 8, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think, because walls are at the borders.

Life span decreases each turn, including current turn. So at turn 8, life span is given, so for (4,1), life span 2 means it will disappear after 2 more turns? Let me read: \"life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it will be gone at the start of turn t+L or something?

Length = 2.\n- **Head Direction**: Left (L).\n- **Possible Moves** (cannot reverse to Right):\n  - Left (L): (2,3)\n  - Up (U): (3,4)\n  - Down (D): (3,2) — but (3,2) is a wall, so invalid.\n- **Valid Moves**: Left (L) or Up (U).\n\n### Food Analysis:\n1. **Immediate Food** (must be eaten on Turn 10 or lost):\n   - (1,6) and (1,2): Not adjacent to head (3,3), so cannot be eaten this turn. Ignore.\n2. **Other Food**:\n   - (2,5): Life span 4 (available until Turn 13).\n   - (1,1): Life span 7 (available until Turn 16).\n   - (2,6): Life span 10 (available until Turn 19).\n\n### Path Planning:\n#### Option 1: Move Left to (2,3) on Turn 10\n- Turn 10: Move L → Head (2,3), Body (3,3).\n- Turn 11: From (2,3), possible moves:\n  - Up (U) to (2,4).\n  - Left (L) to (1,3).\n- If U to (2,4) on Turn 11:\n  - Turn 12: From (2,4), can move U to (2,5) to eat food.\n  - Snake grows to length 3: [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)].\n\n#### Option 2: Move Up to (3,4) on Turn 10\n- Turn 10: Move U → Head (3,4), Body (3,3).\n- Turn 11: From (3,4), possible moves:\n  - Up (U) to (3,5).\n  - Left (L) to (2,4).\n  - Right (R) to (4,4).\n- If L to (2,4) on Turn 11:\n  - Turn 12: From (2,4), can move U to (2,5) to eat food.\n  - Snake grows to length 3: [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4)].\n\n### Comparison:\n- Both options allow reaching (2,5) by Turn 12 to eat the food.\n- **Left-First Path**:\n  - After eating (2,5), snake is aligned vertically at x=2: [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)].\n  - Future flexibility: Can move up to (2,6) or left to (1,3).\n- **Up-First Path**:\n  - After eating (2,5), snake is L-shaped: [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4)].\n  - Future flexibility: Can move up to (2,6) or right to (3,5).\n\n### Risk Assessment:\n- No immediate collision risks in either path.\n- Tail reward danger is not applicable here since the tail does not have food under it after eating (2,5).\n\n### Decision:\nBoth paths are viable, but the **Left-First Path** keeps the snake more compact (aligned vertically), which may simplify future movements and avoid potential traps near walls (e.g., (3,5) is adjacent to walls at (3,6) and (4,5)).\n\n### Final Action:\n\\boxed{L} (Move Left to (2,3)) on Turn 10.",

So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), and the borders are walls. Internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). I should list all wall cells: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, plus the internal ones: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2).\n> - Snake positions: Head at (3,3), and only one body segment at (4,3). So the snake has length 2. Head direction is left (L), meaning it's facing west, so last move was to the left.\n> - Food items:\n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten)\n> - (1,2) with value 1, life span 1 (disappears after this turn)\n> - (2,5) with value 1, life span 4\n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 7\n> - (2,6) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food.

So possible moves from here: since head direction is L, I can't move right immediately (no instant reverse), but I can move up, down, or left.\n> \n> Current position: head (3,3), body (4,3). So if I move left, to (2,3); up to (3,4); down to (3,2); but (3,2) is an internal obstacle, so it's a wall. So down is not possible. Right is not possible because of no reverse. So only possible moves are left or up.\n> \n> - Left: to (2,3)\n> - Up: to (3,4)\n> \n> (3,2) is a wall, so down is invalid. Right is opposite direction, not allowed.

(2,2) is wall.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,6) life 1, value 1 – will disappear after turn 10 if not eaten\n> \n> - (1,2) life 1, value 1 – disappear after turn 10\n> \n> - (2,5) life 4, value 1 – disappears after turn 13? Current turn 10, life span 4, so countdown decreases each turn, including current. Life span is how many turns it lasts, including the current one? Let me check the rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span L at turn t, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? No.\n> \n> If at turn t, a food has life span N, it means it will be present for this turn and the next N-1 turns, so it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1. For example, at turn t, it has N turns left, including current, so after turn t, it has N-1 left, and so on, until after turn t + N - 1, it disappears.\n> \n> Standard way: if life span is N at turn t, it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at the start of turn t + N or something. But for simplicity, since we act on each turn, at turn t, if life span is S, it decreases by 1 each turn, so at turn t, S, at turn t+1, S-1, ..., at turn t + S - 1, it is 1, and after that turn, it disappears. So it is available for S turns starting from turn t.\n> \n> For food at (1,6): life span 1 at turn 10, so it will disappear after this turn (turn 10). Meaning, if not eaten on turn 10, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) life span 1, disappear after turn 10.\n> \n> (2,5) life span 4, so available for turns 10,11,12,13; disappears after turn 13.\n> \n> (1,1) life span 7, available turns 10 to 16.\n> \n> (2,6) life span 10, available turns 10 to 19.\n> \n> Now, snake is at (3,3) head, body at (4,3), direction L.

        "thinking": "Let's analyze the current state and decide the immediate action for Turn \\( t_0 = 11 \\).\n\n### Current State (Turn 11):\n- **Snake Positions**: Head at (2, 3), body at (3, 3).\n- **Head Direction**: Left (L).\n- **Walls**: \n  - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n  - Internal: (3, 2), (4, 5), (3, 6), (3, 1), (2, 2).\n- **Food**: \n  - (1, 2): value 1, life span 1 (disappears after this turn).\n  - (2, 5): value 1, life span 3.\n  - (1, 1): value 1, life span 6.\n  - (2, 6): value 1, life span 9.\n\n### Possible Moves:\nFrom the current head position (2, 3) and direction L, the possible moves are:\n1. **Left (L)**: (1, 3) - Valid (no wall or body).\n2. **Up (U)**: (2, 4) - Valid (no wall or body).\n3. **Down (D)**: (2, 2) - Invalid (wall at (2, 2)).\n4. **Right (R)**: Invalid (opposite of current direction L).\n\nSo, the valid moves are **Left (L)** and **Up (U)**.\n\n### Food Accessibility:\n- **(1, 2)**: Life span 1, disappears after this turn. Current head is at (2, 3), so (1, 2) is adjacent (delta x=-1, delta y=-1). However, the snake can only move orthogonally (U/D/L/R), so (1, 2) is not reachable in one move. Thus, it cannot be eaten this turn and will disappear.\n- **(2, 5)**: Not adjacent to (2, 3). Requires at least two moves to reach.\n- **(1, 1)**: Far away, not immediately reachable.\n- **(2, 6)**: Far away, not immediately reachable.\n\n### Guidance from Previous Plan (Turn 10):\nThe previous plan suggested moving **Left (L)** to (2, 3) on Turn 10 (which is now the current head position), then **Up (U)** to (2, 4) on Turn 11, followed by **Up (U)** to (2, 5) on Turn 12 to eat the food there. This seems like a reasonable plan to reach the closest food at (2, 5).\n\n### Decision for Turn 11:\n- **Move Up (U)**: This aligns with the previous plan to reach (2, 5) by Turn 12. Moving to (2, 4) is safe (no walls or body) and progresses toward the food.\n- **Move Left (L)**: This would take the snake to (1, 3), which doesn't directly help reach any food soon and might limit future options.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate action is to follow the previous plan and move **Up (U)** to (2, 4).\n\n\\boxed{U}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 11 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(3, 2), (4, 5), (3, 6), (3, 1), (2, 2)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(2, 3), (3, 3)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: L\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (1, 2, 1, 1)\n\t- (2, 5, 3, 1)\n\t- (1, 1, 6, 1)\n\t- (2, 6, 9, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 10 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state:\n> \n> - Current turn: t1 = 10\n> - Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), and the borders are walls. Internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). I should list all wall cells: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, plus the internal ones: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2).\n> - Snake positions: Head at (3,3), and only one body segment at (4,3). So the snake has length 2. Head direction is left (L), meaning it's facing west, so last move was to the left.\n> - Food items:\n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten)\n> - (1,2) with value 1, life span 1 (disappears after this turn)\n> - (2,5) with value 1, life span 4\n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 7\n> - (2,6) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> The snake head is at (3,3), and it's facing left. So possible moves from here: since head direction is L, I can't move right immediately (no instant reverse), but I can move up, down, or left.\n> \n> Current position: head (3,3), body (4,3). So if I move left, to (2,3); up to (3,4); down to (3,2); but (3,2) is an internal obstacle, so it's a wall. So down is not possible. Right is not possible because of no reverse. So only possible moves are left or up.\n> \n> - Left: to (2,3)\n> - Up: to (3,4)\n> \n> (3,2) is a wall, so down is invalid. Right is opposite direction, not allowed. So only U or L.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls: all borders, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Internal walls: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). (3,1) and (3,2) are walls, but (3,2) is listed, and (3,1) is also listed. (2,2) is wall.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,6) life 1, value 1 – will disappear after turn 10 if not eaten\n> \n> - (1,2) life 1, value 1 – disappear after turn 10\n> \n> - (2,5) life 4, value 1 – disappears after turn 13? Current turn 10, life span 4, so countdown decreases each turn, including current. Life span is how many turns it lasts, including the current one? Let me check the rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span L at turn t, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? No.\n> \n> If at turn t, a food has life span N, it means it will be present for this turn and the next N-1 turns, so it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1. For example, at turn t, it has N turns left, including current, so after turn t, it has N-1 left, and so on, until after turn t + N - 1, it disappears.\n> \n> Standard way: if life span is N at turn t, it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at the start of turn t + N or something. But for simplicity, since we act on each turn, at turn t, if life span is S, it decreases by 1 each turn, so at turn t, S, at turn t+1, S-1, ..., at turn t + S - 1, it is 1, and after that turn, it disappears. So it is available for S turns starting from turn t.\n> \n> For food at (1,6): life span 1 at turn 10, so it will disappear after this turn (turn 10). Meaning, if not eaten on turn 10, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) life span 1, disappear after turn 10.\n> \n> (2,5) life span 4, so available for turns 10,11,12,13; disappears after turn 13.\n> \n> (1,1) life span 7, available turns 10 to 16.\n> \n> (2,6) life span 10, available turns 10 to 19.\n> \n> Now, snake is at (3,3) head, body at (4,3), direction L. So after moving, the body will move to where the head was, and head moves to new position.\n> \n> If I move left to (2,3), then new positions: head (2,3), body (3,3)\n> \n> If I move up to (3,4), head (3,4), body (3,3)\n> \n> Now, I need to plan for multiple turns.\n> \n> First, the food with short life: (1,6) and (1,2) must be eaten this turn or lost.\n> \n> (1,6) is at x=1,y=6\n> \n> (1,2) is at x=1,y=2\n> \n> Current head at (3,3)\n> \n> From (3,3), to reach (1,6): that's left twice and up three times, but I can only move one step at a time.\n> \n> (3,3) to (1,6): delta x = -2, delta y = +3, so not adjacent.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) is at (1,2), from (3,3) delta x = -2, delta y = -1, not adjacent.\n> \n> So I cannot eat them this turn because they are not adjacent to head position. To eat a food, head must move onto the cell.\n> \n> So (1,6) and (1,2) cannot be eaten this turn since head is at (3,3), not adjacent to either. Therefore, they will disappear after this turn, so I should ignore them for planning; they are not reachable in time.\n> \n> Now, other food: (2,5), (1,1), (2,6)\n> \n> (2,5) at (2,5), which is adjacent to current head? Head at (3,3), (2,5) is at x=2,y=5, so from (3,3) to (2,5): delta x = -1, delta y = +2, not adjacent; adjacent cells are (2,3), (3,4), (4,3), (3,2) but (4,3) is body and (3,2) is wall, so only (2,3) and (3,4) are possible moves.\n> \n> (2,5) is at (2,5), which is two steps away: one left to (2,3) then up to (2,4), then to (2,5), but (2,5) is food, but not directly reachable from (3,3) in one step.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) at (1,1), far away.\n> \n> (2,6) at (2,6), also not adjacent.\n> \n> So no food is directly adjacent to head at (3,3). Therefore, I cannot eat any food this turn immediately.\n> \n> I need to move towards food for future turns.\n> \n> Possible moves: left to (2,3) or up to (3,4).\n> \n> Now, let's evaluate each option.\n> \n> First, move left to (2,3):\n> \n> After moving to (2,3), snake positions: head (2,3), body (3,3).

Positions: after move to (2,3), body is at (3,3). Then if move up to (2,4), new head (2,4), body moves to (2,3). Snake is [(2,4), (2,3)]\n> \n> Direction: moved up, so head direction U.\n> \n> Then from (2,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no reverse, so cannot go down (opposite of U), so can go U, L, R.\n> \n> - U to (2,5) – and (2,5) has food!

Turn 11 is next turn, but at turn 10, (1,2) is present, but I'm at (2,3) on turn 10?

Grid and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8, with borders at \\( x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 \\) being walls.\n- Internal obstacles: \\( (3, 2), (4, 5), (3, 6), (3, 1), (2, 2) \\).\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- Positions: Head at \\( (2, 4) \\), body at \\( (2, 3) \\).\n- Current direction: Up (U).\n\n**3. Food:**\n- \\( (2, 5) \\): Value = +1, Life span = 3 (disappears after turn 14).\n- \\( (1, 1) \\): Value = +1, Life span = 5 (disappears after turn 16).\n- \\( (2, 6) \\): Value = +1, Life span = 8 (disappears after turn 19).\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves at Turn 12\n\n**Current Head Position:** \\( (2, 4) \\), direction U.\n\n**Possible Moves:**\n1. **Up (U)**: \\( (2, 5) \\)\n   - Check: \n     - Not a wall.\n     - Contains food \\( (2, 5) \\).\n     - Eating it: \n       - Length increases to 3.\n       - New positions: Head at \\( (2, 5) \\), body at \\( (2, 4) \\), tail at \\( (2, 3) \\).\n     - No immediate collision risks.\n2. **Left (L)**: \\( (1, 4) \\)\n   - Check:\n     - Not a wall.\n     - No food.\n     - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n3. **Right (R)**: \\( (3, 4) \\)\n   - Check:\n     - Not a wall.\n     - No food.\n     - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n4. **Down (D)**: \\( (2, 3) \\)\n   - Check:\n     - Occupied by the body segment \\( (2, 3) \\).\n     - Not allowed (would collide with body).\n\n**Instant Reverse Constraint:**\n- Current direction is U, so D is not allowed (instant reverse).\n\nThus, valid moves: U, L, R.\n\n### Evaluating Moves Based on Food and Future Planning\n\n**1. Move Up (U) to \\( (2, 5) \\):**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Immediate reward (+1).\n  - Extends snake length, which can be beneficial for future moves.\n  - \\( (2, 5) \\) disappears after turn 14, so eating it now is optimal.\n- **Cons:**\n  - After eating, the snake is longer, which might limit future mobility slightly.\n\n**2. Move Left (L) to \\( (1, 4) \\):**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Positions the snake closer to \\( (1, 1) \\), which has a longer lifespan.\n- **Cons:**\n  - Misses the immediate reward at \\( (2, 5) \\).\n  - \\( (1, 1) \\) can be targeted later after securing \\( (2, 5) \\).\n\n**3. Move Right (R) to \\( (3, 4) \\):**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Moves towards the center, potentially more open space.\n- **Cons:**\n  - No immediate reward.\n  - Less direct path to any food.\n\n### Considering the Previous Plan (from Turn 10)\n\nThe previous plan aimed to:\n1. Move left to \\( (2, 3) \\) at turn 10.\n2. Move up to \\( (2, 4) \\) at turn 11.\n3. Move up to \\( (2, 5) \\) at turn 12 to eat the food.\n\nGiven that the current state matches this plan (snake at \\( (2, 4) \\) at turn 12), continuing with the planned move (U to \\( (2, 5) \\)) is consistent and optimal.\n\n### Potential Future Moves After Eating \\( (2, 5) \\)\n\nAfter eating \\( (2, 5) \\) at turn 12:\n- Snake positions: \\( [(2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3)] \\).\n- Possible moves from \\( (2, 5) \\):\n  - Up (U) to \\( (2, 6) \\): Contains food \\( (2, 6) \\), can eat next.\n  - Left (L) to \\( (1, 5) \\): No food, but can explore towards \\( (1, 1) \\).\n  - Right (R) to \\( (3, 5) \\): Leads to \\( (4, 5) \\) which is a wall, limiting options.\n\nOptimal next move would be U to \\( (2, 6) \\) to eat another food, then plan to navigate towards \\( (1, 1) \\).\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nAfter eating \\( (2, 5) \\):\n- Head at \\( (2, 5) \\), tail at \\( (2, 3) \\).\n- Adjacent to tail: \\( (2, 4) \\) (body segment), not tail.\n- No food under tail, so no danger.\n\nSimilarly, after eating \\( (2, 6) \\):\n- Head at \\( (2, 6) \\), tail at \\( (2, 4) \\).\n- Adjacent to tail: \\( (2, 5) \\) (body segment), no food, so safe.\n\n### Final Decision for Turn 12\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- **Best immediate action:** Move Up (U) to \\( (2, 5) \\) to eat the food.\n- **Consistency with previous plan:** Aligns with the planned sequence.\n- **Future flexibility:** Allows for subsequent moves to \\( (2, 6) \\) and then towards \\( (1, 1) \\).\n\n### Action Sequence (for reference)\n\nContinuing from the previous plan:\n- Turn 10: L to \\( (2, 3) \\).\n- Turn 11: U to \\( (2, 4) \\).\n- Turn 12: U to \\( (2, 5) \\) (eat).\n- Turn 13: U to \\( (2, 6) \\) (eat).\n- Turn 14: L to \\( (1, 6) \\).\n- Turn 15: D to \\( (1, 5) \\).\n\nHowever, since we are at turn 12, the immediate action is:\n\n\\boxed{U}",

So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), and the borders are walls. Internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). I should list all wall cells: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, plus the internal ones: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2).\n> - Snake positions: Head at (3,3), and only one body segment at (4,3). So the snake has length 2. Head direction is left (L), meaning it's facing west, so last move was to the left.\n> - Food items:\n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten)\n> - (1,2) with value 1, life span 1 (disappears after this turn)\n> - (2,5) with value 1, life span 4\n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 7\n> - (2,6) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> The snake head is at (3,3), and it's facing left. So possible moves from here: since head direction is L, I can't move right immediately (no instant reverse), but I can move up, down, or left.\n> \n> Current position: head (3,3), body (4,3). So if I move left, to (2,3); up to (3,4); down to (3,2); but (3,2) is an internal obstacle, so it's a wall. So down is not possible. Right is not possible because of no reverse. So only possible moves are left or up.\n> \n> - Left: to (2,3)\n> - Up: to (3,4)\n> \n> (3,2) is a wall, so down is invalid. Right is opposite direction, not allowed. So only U or L.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls: all borders, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Internal walls: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). (3,1) and (3,2) are walls, but (3,2) is listed, and (3,1) is also listed. (2,2) is wall.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,6) life 1, value 1 – will disappear after turn 10 if not eaten\n> \n> - (1,2) life 1, value 1 – disappear after turn 10\n> \n> - (2,5) life 4, value 1 – disappears after turn 13? Current turn 10, life span 4, so countdown decreases each turn, including current. Life span is how many turns it lasts, including the current one? Let me check the rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span L at turn t, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? No.\n> \n> If at turn t, a food has life span N, it means it will be present for this turn and the next N-1 turns, so it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1. For example, at turn t, it has N turns left, including current, so after turn t, it has N-1 left, and so on, until after turn t + N - 1, it disappears.\n> \n> Standard way: if life span is N at turn t, it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at the start of turn t + N or something. But for simplicity, since we act on each turn, at turn t, if life span is S, it decreases by 1 each turn, so at turn t, S, at turn t+1, S-1, ..., at turn t + S - 1, it is 1, and after that turn, it disappears. So it is available for S turns starting from turn t.\n> \n> For food at (1,6): life span 1 at turn 10, so it will disappear after this turn (turn 10). Meaning, if not eaten on turn 10, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) life span 1, disappear after turn 10.\n> \n> (2,5) life span 4, so available for turns 10,11,12,13; disappears after turn 13.\n> \n> (1,1) life span 7, available turns 10 to 16.\n> \n> (2,6) life span 10, available turns 10 to 19.\n> \n> Now, snake is at (3,3) head, body at (4,3), direction L. So after moving, the body will move to where the head was, and head moves to new position.\n> \n> If I move left to (2,3), then new positions: head (2,3), body (3,3)\n> \n> If I move up to (3,4), head (3,4), body (3,3)\n> \n> Now, I need to plan for multiple turns.\n> \n> First, the food with short life: (1,6) and (1,2) must be eaten this turn or lost.\n> \n> (1,6) is at x=1,y=6\n> \n> (1,2) is at x=1,y=2\n> \n> Current head at (3,3)\n> \n> From (3,3), to reach (1,6): that's left twice and up three times, but I can only move one step at a time.\n> \n> (3,3) to (1,6): delta x = -2, delta y = +3, so not adjacent.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) is at (1,2), from (3,3) delta x = -2, delta y = -1, not adjacent.\n> \n> So I cannot eat them this turn because they are not adjacent to head position. To eat a food, head must move onto the cell.\n> \n> So (1,6) and (1,2) cannot be eaten this turn since head is at (3,3), not adjacent to either. Therefore, they will disappear after this turn, so I should ignore them for planning; they are not reachable in time.\n> \n> Now, other food: (2,5), (1,1), (2,6)\n> \n> (2,5) at (2,5), which is adjacent to current head? Head at (3,3), (2,5) is at x=2,y=5, so from (3,3) to (2,5): delta x = -1, delta y = +2, not adjacent; adjacent cells are (2,3), (3,4), (4,3), (3,2) but (4,3) is body and (3,2) is wall, so only (2,3) and (3,4) are possible moves.\n> \n> (2,5) is at (2,5), which is two steps away: one left to (2,3) then up to (2,4), then to (2,5), but (2,5) is food, but not directly reachable from (3,3) in one step.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) at (1,1), far away.\n> \n> (2,6) at (2,6), also not adjacent.\n> \n> So no food is directly adjacent to head at (3,3).

Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I believe. Let me confirm: borders are x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so yes, walls are the outer edges. Also, internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2).\n> \n> Internal obstacles are given as coordinates, so (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). That means these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,5), then body at (2,4), and tail at (2,3). So the snake is vertical, going down from (2,5) to (2,3). Head direction is U, which is up. But the head is at (2,5), and moving up would be to (2,6), but since direction is U, and positions are [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)], which is decreasing y, so if head is at (2,5) and moving up (U) should increase y, but (2,4) is below, so the direction might be inconsistent. Let's see: positions are listed head first, so head at (2,5), then (2,4), then (2,3). If head is moving up, that means from previous turn, it was moving up to (2,5), but (2,4) has lower y, so if it was moving up to (2,5), y increased, so previous position might have been (2,4) or something. Current head direction is given as U, so for the next move, I can choose to continue up, or turn left or right, but not down, since down would be opposite.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is U (up), so I cannot move D (down) next turn. I can move U, L, or R.\n> \n> Now food positions:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life_span 4\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1, life_span 7\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1, life_span 10\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all positive food? Value is given as 1, which is positive, and penalty would be -1, but here all are 1, so all positive food. Life span: for (1,1) it's 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns including current turn 13, so it will be gone by turn 17? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 13, life_span is 4, so after turn 13, it becomes 3, then 2, then 1, then 0 on turn 17, so it disappears after turn 16 or when life_span reaches 0? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if life_span is N at turn t, it decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until 0, when it disappears.

Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I believe. Let me confirm: borders are x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so yes, walls are the outer edges. Also, internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2).\n> \n> Internal obstacles are given as coordinates, so (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). That means these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,5), then body at (2,4), and tail at (2,3). So the snake is vertical, going down from (2,5) to (2,3). Head direction is U, which is up. But the head is at (2,5), and moving up would be to (2,6), but since direction is U, and positions are [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)], which is decreasing y, so if head is at (2,5) and moving up (U) should increase y, but (2,4) is below, so the direction might be inconsistent. Let's see: positions are listed head first, so head at (2,5), then (2,4), then (2,3). If head is moving up, that means from previous turn, it was moving up to (2,5), but (2,4) has lower y, so if it was moving up to (2,5), y increased, so previous position might have been (2,4) or something. Current head direction is given as U, so for the next move, I can choose to continue up, or turn left or right, but not down, since down would be opposite.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is U (up), so I cannot move D (down) next turn. I can move U, L, or R.\n> \n> Now food positions:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life_span 4\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1, life_span 7\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1, life_span 10\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all positive food? Value is given as 1, which is positive, and penalty would be -1, but here all are 1, so all positive food. Life span: for (1,1) it's 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns including current turn 13, so it will be gone by turn 17? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 13, life_span is 4, so after turn 13, it becomes 3, then 2, then 1, then 0 on turn 17, so it disappears after turn 16 or when life_span reaches 0? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if life_span is N at turn t, it decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until 0, when it disappears. So for food at (1,1), life_span 4 at turn 13, so:\n> \n> - Turn 13: life_span 4\n> \n> - Turn 14: life_span 3\n> \n> - Turn 15: life_span 2\n> \n> - Turn 16: life_span 1\n> \n> - Turn 17: life_span 0, disappears, so not available on turn 17.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) life_span 7: from turn 13 to 19 (since 13+6=19, turn 13:7, 14:6, ..., 19:1, 20:0 disappear).\n> \n> Turn 13: life_span=7\n> \n> Turn 14:6\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn 19:1\n> \n> Turn 20:0, disappear.\n> \n> But since we start from turn 13, and life_span decreases each turn including current, so it will be present until turn 19 inclusive if life_span=7 at turn 13.\n> \n> Let L be life_span at turn t.\n> \n> At turn t, it has L turns left.\n> \n> After turn t, at turn t+1, it has L-1 left.\n> \n> It disappears when life_span reaches 0, so at turn t + L, it has 0, so not available on turn t + L.\n> \n> For (1,1): L=4 at turn 13, so available until turn 16 (since turn 16: life_span=1, after turn 16, at turn 17, life_span=0, gone).

So:\n> \n> - (3,1): x=3, y=1\n> \n> - (3,2): x=3, y=2\n> \n> - (2,2): x=2, y=2\n> \n> - (4,5): x=4, y=5\n> \n> - (3,6): x=3, y=6\n> \n> Snake positions: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5)] so head is at (1,4), then body at (1,5), and tail at (2,5). Head direction is D, which is down. Since it's moving down, and positions are given head first, from (1,4) to (1,5) to (2,5). If head is at (1,4) and moving down, down would be decreasing y? Let's clarify coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). But in coordinate systems, y=0 is often the bottom, so U might be up, increasing y.\n> \n> In the movement definition:\n> \n> - U: (x, y+1) — so if y increases upwards, this is up.\n> \n> - D: (x, y-1) — down, decreasing y.\n> \n> - L: (x-1, y) — left, decreasing x.\n> \n> - R: (x+1, y) — right, increasing x.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (1,4), direction D, so it came from above? Positions: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]\n> \n> If head is at (1,4) and moving D (down, y-1), that means it was previously at (1,5), since moving down to (1,4) would be from higher y to lower y. Let's think about the movement.\n> \n> At the previous turn, head was at (1,5), and it moved down to (1,4). Then the body segments follow: after head moves, the body moves to where the head was, so from (1,5) to the next segment.\n> \n> The positions are given as a list: index 0 is head, index 1 is first body, index 2 is tail.\n> \n> So at current turn, head is at (1,4), which it just moved to. Before that, head was at (1,5), and the first body was at (2,5) or something? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]\n> \n> - Head: (1,4)\n> \n> - Body segment 1: (1,5)\n> \n> - Body segment 2 (tail): (2,5)\n> \n> Since head direction is D (down), it moved from (1,5) to (1,4) this turn? Positions are current positions.\n> \n> At the start of turn, snake is at these positions. Head at (1,4), and it moved there in the previous action, I assume.\n> \n> Head direction is given as D, meaning the current movement direction is down, so it is facing down.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 2\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> All have value 1, so all positive food? Value is +1 for all, so no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: (1,1) has life 2, meaning it disappears after 2 more turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (1,1) with life_span 2, at turn 15, it has 2 turns left, including turn 15. So after turn 15, it has 1 turn left, and after turn 16, it disappears. Similarly, (2,6) life 5, disappears after 5 turns from now, so after turn 19? Let's calculate.\n> \n> At turn t, life_span N, it will disappear after N turns, meaning it is present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and gone at turn t+N.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, countdown = N, then at turn t+1, countdown = N-1, ..., at turn t + (N-1), countdown=1, then at turn t+N, it disappears.\n> \n> For (1,1): life_span=2 at turn 15, so it will be gone after turn 16. Present on turn 15 and 16, gone on turn 17.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6): life_span=5, present turns 15 to 19, gone turn 20.\n> \n> (3,5): life_span=8, present turns 15 to 22, gone turn 23.\n> \n> Now, grid size: from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, but walls at borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so the grid is 8x8, but borders are walls, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (4,5), (3,6)\n> \n> (3,1) is at x=3,y=1\n> \n> (3,2) x=3,y=2\n> \n> (2,2) x=2,y=2\n> \n> (4,5) x=4,y=5\n> \n> (3,6) x=3,y=6\n> \n> Now, snake at [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]\n> \n> Head at (1,4), direction D (down).\n> \n> Possible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is D, so I cannot move U (up) next, because that would be opposite.\n> \n> \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> So current direction D, so cannot move U. Possible moves: D, L, R.\n> \n> But moving D: from (1,4) to (1,3)\n> \n> Moving L: to (0,4), but x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Moving R: to (2,4)\n> \n> Moving U: not allowed because opposite to D.\n> \n> So valid moves: D to (1,3) or R to (2,4)\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's list all food:\n> \n> - Food at (1,1): value +1, life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 16 or it's gone.\n> \n> - Food at (2,6): value +1, life span 5, so can be eaten up to turn 19.\n> \n> - Food at (3,5): value +1, life span 8, plenty of time.\n> \n> But I need to avoid risks.\n> \n> Also, special case: food can be under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves on.\n> \n> In this case, is any food under body? Snake is at (1,4), (1,5), (2,5). Food at (1,1), (2,6), (3,5). None of these are under snake body, so no issue.\n> \n> (1,5) is body, but no food there; food at (1,1) is elsewhere.\n> \n> Now, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Here, tail is at (2,5). Head is at (1,4), which is adjacent? Let's see positions.\n> \n> Head (1,4), tail (2,5). Distance: |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so diagonal, not adjacent in terms of up/down/left/right. Adjacent means sharing edge, so same x or y, |dx| or |dy| =1.\n> \n> (1,4) and (2,5): dx=1, dy=1, so not adjacent; it's diagonal, which is not directly adjacent for movement purposes. Adjacency is only orthogonal, not diagonal, since moves are U/D/L/R.\n> \n> So head and tail are not adjacent; head is at (1,4), tail at (2,5), which is one step right and one step down, so not adjacent cells.\n> \n> Therefore, no immediate tail reward danger.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence for turn 15 and beyond, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, possible actions at turn 15:\n> \n> - Move D to (1,3)\n> \n> - Move R to (2,4)\n> \n> If I move D to (1,3):\n> \n> - Head to (1,3), then body moves: the segment at (1,5) moves to where head was, (1,4), and tail at (2,5) moves to where the first body was, (1,5)? After head moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> After moving head to new position, the body segments follow: segment 1 moves to old head position, segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position.\n> \n> So if head moves to (1,3), then:\n> \n> - New head: (1,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 1 (was at (1,5)) moves to old head position (1,4)\n> \n> - Body segment 2 (tail, was at (2,5)) moves to old body segment 1 position (1,5)\n> \n> So new positions: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5)]\n> \n> Snake length remains 3 unless food eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move R to (2,4):\n> \n> - Head to (2,4)\n> \n> - Body segment 1 to (1,4) (old head)\n> \n> - Body segment 2 to (1,5) (old body segment 1)\n> \n> New positions: [(2,4), (1,4), (1,5)]\n> \n> Now, food at (1,1) is close, but life span 2, so I need to eat it soon.\n> \n> (1,1) is at bottom-left, head at (1,4), so to reach (1,1), I need to go down.\n> \n> If I move D to (1,3), I'm closer to (1,1).\n> \n> But (1,1) has walls around? x=0 and y=0 are walls, but (1,1) is playable since x=1,y=1 not border or obstacle.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,1) is obstacle, but (1,1) is fine.\n> \n> Path to (1,1): from (1,4) to (1,3) to (1,2) to (1,1), but (1,2) is not obstacle?

The previous plan suggests moving R again to (3,4).\n\n**Possible Moves at Turn 16**:\n- Current direction: R.\n- Cannot move left (opposite direction).\n- Possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Move R to (3,4)**:\n   - New head: (3,4).\n   - Body: (2,4).\n   - Tail: (1,4).\n   - This aligns with the previous plan to approach (3,5).\n\n2. **Move U to (2,5)**:\n   - New head: (2,5).\n   - Body: (2,4).\n   - Tail: (1,4).\n   - This could be a detour from the plan but might be useful for other foods.\n\n3. **Move D to (2,3)**:\n   - New head: (2,3).\n   - Body: (2,4).\n   - Tail: (1,4).\n   - Moves away from current foods.\n\n**Decision**:\nThe previous plan's move R to (3,4) is valid and continues the path toward (3,5). \n\n### Verifying the Plan's Continuation\n\nAfter moving to (3,4) at turn 16:\n- **Turn 17**: Move U to (3,5) to eat the food.\n  - New head: (3,5).\n  - Body: (3,4), (2,4), (1,4).\n  - Snake grows to length 4: [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)].\n\n- **Turn 18**: From (3,5), possible moves:\n  - U: (3,6) → obstacle.\n  - D: (3,4) → body, collision.\n  - L: (2,5).\n  - R: (4,5) → obstacle.\n  - Only L to (2,5) is valid.\n\n- **Turn 19**: From (2,5), move U to (2,6) to eat the food.\n  - New head: (2,6).\n  - Body: (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4).\n  - Snake grows to length 5: [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4)].\n\nThis sequence successfully eats both (3,5) and (2,6) by turn 19.\n\n### Alternative Considerations\n\n- **Food at (1,1)**:\n  - Life span 1, so it disappears after turn 16.\n  - Current head at (2,4), cannot reach (1,1) in one move (distance is 2 steps in x and 3 in y).\n  - Thus, it's impossible to eat (1,1) before it disappears.\n\n- **Food at (6,6)**:\n  - Far away, life span 10, can be considered later if the snake survives.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- After eating (2,6) at turn 19, the snake is at [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4)].\n  - From (2,6), possible moves:\n    - L to (1,6).\n    - D to (2,5) → body, collision.\n    - R to (3,6) → obstacle.\n    - U to (2,7) → wall.\n    - Only L to (1,6) is safe.\n  - This leads to a potential path down the left side, but careful planning is needed to avoid dead ends.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe previous plan is still valid and optimal for the current state. Continuing with the planned move R at turn 16 sets up the snake to eat both (3,5) and (2,6) efficiently.\n\n### Final Action for Turn 16\n\n\\boxed{R}",

It's turn 15, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The walls are defined: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but since walls are there, I can't go to those coordinates. Also, there are internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). I should plot this to visualize.\n> \n> Let me sketch a grid. Rows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n> \n> - Border walls: all cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). So:\n> \n> - (3,1): x=3, y=1\n> \n> - (3,2): x=3, y=2\n> \n> - (2,2): x=2, y=2\n> \n> - (4,5): x=4, y=5\n> \n> - (3,6): x=3, y=6\n> \n> Snake positions: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5)] so head is at (1,4), then body at (1,5), and tail at (2,5). Head direction is D, which is down. Since it's moving down, and positions are given head first, from (1,4) to (1,5) to (2,5). If head is at (1,4) and moving down, down would be decreasing y? Let's clarify coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). But in coordinate systems, y=0 is often the bottom, so U might be up, increasing y.\n> \n> In the movement definition:\n> \n> - U: (x, y+1) — so if y increases upwards, this is up.\n> \n> - D: (x, y-1) — down, decreasing y.\n> \n> - L: (x-1, y) — left, decreasing x.\n> \n> - R: (x+1, y) — right, increasing x.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (1,4), direction D, so it came from above? Positions: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]\n> \n> If head is at (1,4) and moving D (down, y-1), that means it was previously at (1,5), since moving down to (1,4) would be from higher y to lower y. Let's think about the movement.\n> \n> At the previous turn, head was at (1,5), and it moved down to (1,4). Then the body segments follow: after head moves, the body moves to where the head was, so from (1,5) to the next segment.\n> \n> The positions are given as a list: index 0 is head, index 1 is first body, index 2 is tail.\n> \n> So at current turn, head is at (1,4), which it just moved to. Before that, head was at (1,5), and the first body was at (2,5) or something? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]\n> \n> - Head: (1,4)\n> \n> - Body segment 1: (1,5)\n> \n> - Body segment 2 (tail): (2,5)\n> \n> Since head direction is D (down), it moved from (1,5) to (1,4) this turn? Positions are current positions.\n> \n> At the start of turn, snake is at these positions. Head at (1,4), and it moved there in the previous action, I assume.\n> \n> Head direction is given as D, meaning the current movement direction is down, so it is facing down.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 2\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> All have value 1, so all positive food? Value is +1 for all, so no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: (1,1) has life 2, meaning it disappears after 2 more turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (1,1) with life_span 2, at turn 15, it has 2 turns left, including turn 15. So after turn 15, it has 1 turn left, and after turn 16, it disappears. Similarly, (2,6) life 5, disappears after 5 turns from now, so after turn 19? Let's calculate.\n> \n> At turn t, life_span N, it will disappear after N turns, meaning it is present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and gone at turn t+N.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, countdown = N, then at turn t+1, countdown = N-1, ..., at turn t + (N-1), countdown=1, then at turn t+N, it disappears.\n> \n> For (1,1): life_span=2 at turn 15, so it will be gone after turn 16.

Snake is at (1,4), (1,5), (2,5). Food at (1,1), (2,6), (3,5). None of these are under snake body, so no issue.\n> \n> (1,5) is body, but no food there; food at (1,1) is elsewhere.\n> \n> Now, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Here, tail is at (2,5). Head is at (1,4), which is adjacent? Let's see positions.\n> \n> Head (1,4), tail (2,5). Distance: |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so diagonal, not adjacent in terms of up/down/left/right. Adjacent means sharing edge, so same x or y, |dx| or |dy| =1.\n> \n> (1,4) and (2,5): dx=1, dy=1, so not adjacent; it's diagonal, which is not directly adjacent for movement purposes. Adjacency is only orthogonal, not diagonal, since moves are U/D/L/R.\n> \n> So head and tail are not adjacent; head is at (1,4), tail at (2,5), which is one step right and one step down, so not adjacent cells.\n> \n> Therefore, no immediate tail reward danger.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence for turn 15 and beyond, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, possible actions at turn 15:\n> \n> - Move D to (1,3)\n> \n> - Move R to (2,4)\n> \n> If I move D to (1,3):\n> \n> - Head to (1,3), then body moves: the segment at (1,5) moves to where head was, (1,4), and tail at (2,5) moves to where the first body was, (1,5)?

Direction is R (right).\n- **Possible Moves**: Cannot reverse to L (left). Options: U (up), D (down), R (right).\n- **Food**:\n  - (2,6): Life span 4, value +1.\n  - (3,5): Life span 6, value +1 (directly above head).\n  - (6,6): Life span 9, value +1 (far away).\n\n### Immediate Options:\n1. **Move U (up) to (3,5)**:\n   - Eat food at (3,5): +1 score, snake grows to length 4.\n   - Next turn (18), must move L (left) to (2,5) (only safe move).\n   - Turn 19: Can move U to (2,6) to eat food there (life span 4, so must act soon).\n   - **Risk**: After eating (2,6), snake is long and may get stuck (only move L to (1,6) is safe).\n\n2. **Move R (right) to (4,4)**:\n   - No food eaten. Snake moves to [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4)].\n   - Next moves can explore toward (6,6), but (2,6) may expire.\n\n3. **Move D (down) to (3,3)**:\n   - No food eaten. Snake moves to [(3,3), (3,4), (2,4)].\n   - Next moves are limited (cannot go up or down due to body/obstacles).\n\n### Decision:\n- **Best Immediate Action**: Move U to (3,5) to eat the food. This maximizes score and aligns with the Thinking Model's plan to prioritize (2,6) next.\n- **Why?**:\n  - (3,5) is safe to eat now (no collision risks).\n  - (2,6) must be eaten soon (life span 4), and this path allows that.\n  - The alternative (moving R or D) delays eating and risks losing (2,6).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{U}",

It's turn 17, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). So the grid has obstacles at these points.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head at (3,4), then body at (2,4), and tail at (1,4). So the snake is horizontal, head to the right, at y=4, from x=1 to x=3.

Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it will be gone at turn t + N.\n> \n> Current turn t=17.\n> \n> For (2,6): life span 4, so disappears after turn 17+4=21? Let's see: countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 17, life span is 4. After turn 17, it becomes 3, and so on, until life span 0, then it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 17 to 20, and disappears at turn 21 or when eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5): life span 6, so available until turn 17+5=22?

Let's clarify.\n> \n> If life span decreases every turn including current, then:\n> \n> - Turn t: life = N\n> \n> - After action on turn t, it might be eaten or not, but life decreases at end of turn? The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> I think \"including current\" means that during turn t, the life span is N, and after turn t, it becomes N-1.\n> \n> But when is it eaten? When the head moves onto the food cell during a turn.\n> \n> So for food with life span L at turn t, it can be eaten on turns from t to t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, (2,6) at t=17, life=4: can be eaten on turns 17,18,19,20. Disappears after turn 20 or at turn 21? Typically, it disappears when life span reaches 0.\n> \n> Assume that at the start of turn t, food has life span L. After the turn, if not eaten, life span decreases by 1. If eaten during the turn, it's removed.\n> \n> So for (2,6): at turn 17, life=4; after turn 17, if not eaten, life=3; ... until life=0, then it disappears.\n> \n> So it can be eaten on any turn from 17 to 20 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5): life=6 at t=17, can be eaten turns 17 to 22.\n> \n> (6,6): life=9, turns 17 to 25.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,4), direction R (right).

When you eat, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Snake movement: normally, when moving to a new cell without food, head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position, tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> If head moves to food, then head moves to food, new segment added, so tail doesn't move, snake length increases.\n> \n> Here, if I move U to (3,5), which has food, I eat it, so new positions: head at (3,5), then previous head (3,4) becomes body, (2,4) body, and tail (1,4) stays, so snake becomes [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)] with length 4 now.\n> \n> But is (3,5) safe?

It's turn 17, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). So the grid has obstacles at these points.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head at (3,4), then body at (2,4), and tail at (1,4). So the snake is horizontal, head to the right, at y=4, from x=1 to x=3. Head direction is R (right), which matches since head is at (3,4) and previous was (2,4), so moving right.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 4, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (3,5) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, I need to think at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2)\n> \n> List them:\n> \n> - (3,1)\n> \n> - (2,2)\n> \n> - (3,2)\n> \n> - (4,5)\n> \n> - (3,6)\n> \n> (3,2) and (2,2) are both obstacles, and (3,1), (3,6), (4,5).\n> \n> Snake: head (3,4), body (2,4), tail (1,4).

Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it will be gone at turn t + N.\n> \n> Current turn t=17.\n> \n> For (2,6): life span 4, so disappears after turn 17+4=21? Let's see: countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 17, life span is 4. After turn 17, it becomes 3, and so on, until life span 0, then it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 17 to 20, and disappears at turn 21 or when eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5): life span 6, so available until turn 17+5=22? At turn 17, life=6, after turn 17: life=5, ..., after turn 22: life=0, disappear at turn 23? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If life span decreases every turn including current, then:\n> \n> - Turn t: life = N\n> \n> - After action on turn t, it might be eaten or not, but life decreases at end of turn? The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> I think \"including current\" means that during turn t, the life span is N, and after turn t, it becomes N-1.\n> \n> But when is it eaten? When the head moves onto the food cell during a turn.\n> \n> So for food with life span L at turn t, it can be eaten on turns from t to t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, (2,6) at t=17, life=4: can be eaten on turns 17,18,19,20. Disappears after turn 20 or at turn 21? Typically, it disappears when life span reaches 0.\n> \n> Assume that at the start of turn t, food has life span L. After the turn, if not eaten, life span decreases by 1. If eaten during the turn, it's removed.\n> \n> So for (2,6): at turn 17, life=4; after turn 17, if not eaten, life=3; ... until life=0, then it disappears.\n> \n> So it can be eaten on any turn from 17 to 20 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5): life=6 at t=17, can be eaten turns 17 to 22.\n> \n> (6,6): life=9, turns 17 to 25.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,4), direction R (right).

Since it's positive, I gain +1 score and snake length increases by one. After eating, the new head is at (3,5), and the tail stays or moves? When you eat, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Snake movement: normally, when moving to a new cell without food, head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position, tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> If head moves to food, then head moves to food, new segment added, so tail doesn't move, snake length increases.\n> \n> Here, if I move U to (3,5), which has food, I eat it, so new positions: head at (3,5), then previous head (3,4) becomes body, (2,4) body, and tail (1,4) stays, so snake becomes [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)] with length 4 now.\n> \n> But is (3,5) safe? I need to avoid collisions.\n> \n> After moving, head at (3,5). What are the body positions? (3,4), (2,4), (1,4). So (3,5) is not adjacent to body except possibly the neck, but neck is (3,4) which is below, not same cell.

Moving here is safe (tail will move away).\n   - No food at (2,4), so no growth.\n\n3. **Left (L) to (1,5)**:\n   - Empty cell, no food.\n   - Safe move (no collision).\n\n4. **Right (R) to (3,5)**:\n   - (3,5) is a body segment (not tail), so collision. Invalid.\n\n### Best Immediate Action:\n- **Up (U) to (2,6)** is the best choice because:\n  1. It eats the positive food (+1 score, +1 length).\n  2. The food at (2,6) will disappear soon (life span 2).\n  3.

It's turn 19, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), I think. Walls are at the borders and also some internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,5), then body segments at (3,5), (3,4), (2,4). So the snake has 4 segments. Head direction is left, so it was moving left to (2,5) from (3,5), I assume. Since positions are head first, from (2,5) to (3,5) to (3,4) to (2,4). Let me plot this.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Snake:\n> \n> - Head: (2,5)\n> \n> - Body: (3,5)\n> \n> - Body: (3,4)\n> \n> - Tail: (2,4)\n> \n> Head direction is L, so it moved left to (2,5) from (3,5).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,2) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for all, and life span decreases each turn.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,6), it has life span 2, meaning it will disappear after 2 more turns, including current turn? Let's see the rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (2,6), life span 2 at turn 19. After turn 19, countdown to 1. After turn 20, countdown to 0, and it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 19 or 20, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) life span 7: disappears after turn 25 (19+7-1? Let's calculate properly.\n> \n> At turn t, life span N: it will disappear after N turns, meaning at the end of turn t+N-1, I think? Better to think in terms of when it vanishes.\n> \n> Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, countdown is N. After turn t, countdown becomes N-1. After turn t+1, N-2, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears before the next turn or something. But for eating, as long as countdown >0, it can be eaten on that turn.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" but it doesn't specify when exactly it decreases. I think it's at the end of the turn or beginning? For simplicity, we can assume that at the start of turn t, the food has life span L, and after the turn, if not eaten, L decreases by 1. If L was 1, it disappears after the turn.\n> \n> But for movement, we decide the action for the turn, and if head moves to food, it is eaten.\n> \n> So for food at (2,6), life span 2 at turn 19. If not eaten on turn 19, at the end of turn 19, life span becomes 1. Then on turn 20, if not eaten, at end of turn 20, life span 0, disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) life span 7: can be eaten from turn 19 to 25? Turn 19: L=7, after turn 19, L=6 if not eaten, and so on, until after turn 25, L=7-7=0? Let's index turns.\n> \n> Turn 19: food has life span L.\n> \n> After action on turn 19, if head moves to food, eaten; else, L decreases by 1.\n> \n> If L was 1, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n> \n> If L >1, it becomes L-1 for next turn.\n> \n> So for (2,6): L=2 at turn 19. If not eaten on turn 19, L=1 for turn 20. If not eaten on turn 20, it disappears.\n> \n> For (6,6): L=7 at turn 19, so it will last until turn 25 (after turn 25, L=0).\n> \n> Turn 19: L=7\n> \n> After turn 19: if not eaten, L=6\n> \n> After turn 20: L=5\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 24: L=1 (for turn 25)\n> \n> After turn 25: L=0, disappear\n> \n> So it can be eaten on turns 19 to 25 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) L=10, can be eaten from turn 19 to 28.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns.

It's turn 19, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), I think. Walls are at the borders and also some internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,5), then body segments at (3,5), (3,4), (2,4). So the snake has 4 segments. Head direction is left, so it was moving left to (2,5) from (3,5), I assume. Since positions are head first, from (2,5) to (3,5) to (3,4) to (2,4). Let me plot this.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Snake:\n> \n> - Head: (2,5)\n> \n> - Body: (3,5)\n> \n> - Body: (3,4)\n> \n> - Tail: (2,4)\n> \n> Head direction is L, so it moved left to (2,5) from (3,5).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,2) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for all, and life span decreases each turn.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,6), it has life span 2, meaning it will disappear after 2 more turns, including current turn? Let's see the rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (2,6), life span 2 at turn 19. After turn 19, countdown to 1. After turn 20, countdown to 0, and it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 19 or 20, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) life span 7: disappears after turn 25 (19+7-1? Let's calculate properly.\n> \n> At turn t, life span N: it will disappear after N turns, meaning at the end of turn t+N-1, I think? Better to think in terms of when it vanishes.\n> \n> Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, countdown is N. After turn t, countdown becomes N-1. After turn t+1, N-2, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears before the next turn or something. But for eating, as long as countdown >0, it can be eaten on that turn.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" but it doesn't specify when exactly it decreases. I think it's at the end of the turn or beginning? For simplicity, we can assume that at the start of turn t, the food has life span L, and after the turn, if not eaten, L decreases by 1. If L was 1, it disappears after the turn.\n> \n> But for movement, we decide the action for the turn, and if head moves to food, it is eaten.\n> \n> So for food at (2,6), life span 2 at turn 19. If not eaten on turn 19, at the end of turn 19, life span becomes 1. Then on turn 20, if not eaten, at end of turn 20, life span 0, disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) life span 7: can be eaten from turn 19 to 25? Turn 19: L=7, after turn 19, L=6 if not eaten, and so on, until after turn 25, L=7-7=0? Let's index turns.\n> \n> Turn 19: food has life span L.\n> \n> After action on turn 19, if head moves to food, eaten; else, L decreases by 1.\n> \n> If L was 1, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n> \n> If L >1, it becomes L-1 for next turn.\n> \n> So for (2,6): L=2 at turn 19. If not eaten on turn 19, L=1 for turn 20. If not eaten on turn 20, it disappears.\n> \n> For (6,6): L=7 at turn 19, so it will last until turn 25 (after turn 25, L=0).\n> \n> Turn 19: L=7\n> \n> After turn 19: if not eaten, L=6\n> \n> After turn 20: L=5\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 24: L=1 (for turn 25)\n> \n> After turn 25: L=0, disappear\n> \n> So it can be eaten on turns 19 to 25 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) L=10, can be eaten from turn 19 to 28.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns.

The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). Snake positions are: head at (1,6), then (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4). So the snake has 5 segments. Head direction is L, which means left, so it was moving left to (1,6) from (2,6) I assume? Snake positions are listed head first, so from (1,6) to (2,6) to (2,5) etc. Since head direction is L, it's moving left.\n> \n> Now, food: there are two food items:\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1 and life span 5\n> \n> - (4,2) with value 1 and life span 8\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span means they disappear after that many turns, including the current turn. So for (6,6), life span 5, it will disappear after turn 21 + 5 = turn 26? Let's see: life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 21, life span is 5, meaning it has 5 turns left including turn 21. After turn 21, it will have 4 turns left, and so on, until turn 25 it has 1 turn left, and after turn 25, it disappears, so it's gone at turn 26. Similarly, (4,2) has life span 8, so it disappears after turn 21 + 8 - 1? I need to be careful.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", and \"disappears after N turns\". So for a food with life span N at turn t, it will be present for N more turns, including turn t. So it disappears at the start of turn t + N.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span N: after turn t, life span becomes N-1; when life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for (6,6) at turn 21, life span 5: after turn 21, it will have 4 left; after turn 22, 3 left; ... after turn 25, 0 left, so it disappears before turn 26. So it can be eaten from turn 21 to turn 25 inclusive? At turn 25, life span is 1, so it can be eaten on turn 25, and then disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, for (4,2), life span 8 at turn 21, so it can be eaten from turn 21 to turn 28 inclusive, since at turn 28, life span would be 1 (if not eaten), and disappears before turn 29.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 21.\n> \n> Current head position: (1,6)\n> \n> Head direction: L, so last move was left to (1,6).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But no instant reverse, so since head direction is L, I cannot move right (opposite) on the next turn. So for turn 21, I can move U, D, or L, but not R.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid walls and body collisions.\n> \n> Walls: border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4). So the body segments are at (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4). Tail is at (3,4).\n> \n> Now, for turn 21, I need to choose a move: U, D, L.\n> \n> Possible moves from (1,6):\n> \n> - U: up to (1,7) — but y=7 is a wall, so invalid, collision.\n> \n> - D: down to (1,5) — is this valid? (1,5) is within bounds, x=1, y=5, not wall? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=5 is fine. Also, not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4). (1,5) is not in this list, so empty. Also, no obstacle? Internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). None at (1,5), so (1,5) should be free.\n> \n> - L: left to (0,6) — x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - R: right to (2,6) — but (2,6) is occupied by the snake's body (second segment). But is it a collision? Head moving to a body segment is deadly, except if it's the tail and we're eating food or something? Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a body segment other than the tail is collision. Here, (2,6) is the second segment, not the tail. Tail is at (3,4). So moving to (2,6) would be collision, invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is D: down to (1,5).\n> \n> Is that right? U to (1,7) wall, invalid. L to (0,6) wall, invalid. R to (2,6) body, invalid. D to (1,5) seems free.

No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to where the next one was, but since it's a list, we add the new head and remove the tail.\n> \n> So positions: new head (1,5), then the old head (1,6) becomes the first body segment, then (2,6) becomes second, then (2,5) becomes third, then (3,5) becomes fourth, and the tail (3,4) is removed since no food eaten.\n> \n> After move, the body segments are the previous positions except the last one is removed if no growth.\n> \n> So new positions: [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)]?

The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). Snake positions are: head at (1,6), then (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4). So the snake has 5 segments. Head direction is L, which means left, so it was moving left to (1,6) from (2,6) I assume? Snake positions are listed head first, so from (1,6) to (2,6) to (2,5) etc. Since head direction is L, it's moving left.\n> \n> Now, food: there are two food items:\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1 and life span 5\n> \n> - (4,2) with value 1 and life span 8\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span means they disappear after that many turns, including the current turn. So for (6,6), life span 5, it will disappear after turn 21 + 5 = turn 26? Let's see: life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 21, life span is 5, meaning it has 5 turns left including turn 21. After turn 21, it will have 4 turns left, and so on, until turn 25 it has 1 turn left, and after turn 25, it disappears, so it's gone at turn 26. Similarly, (4,2) has life span 8, so it disappears after turn 21 + 8 - 1? I need to be careful.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", and \"disappears after N turns\". So for a food with life span N at turn t, it will be present for N more turns, including turn t. So it disappears at the start of turn t + N.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span N: after turn t, life span becomes N-1; when life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for (6,6) at turn 21, life span 5: after turn 21, it will have 4 left; after turn 22, 3 left; ... after turn 25, 0 left, so it disappears before turn 26. So it can be eaten from turn 21 to turn 25 inclusive? At turn 25, life span is 1, so it can be eaten on turn 25, and then disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, for (4,2), life span 8 at turn 21, so it can be eaten from turn 21 to turn 28 inclusive, since at turn 28, life span would be 1 (if not eaten), and disappears before turn 29.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 21.\n> \n> Current head position: (1,6)\n> \n> Head direction: L, so last move was left to (1,6).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But no instant reverse, so since head direction is L, I cannot move right (opposite) on the next turn. So for turn 21, I can move U, D, or L, but not R.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid walls and body collisions.\n> \n> Walls: border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4). So the body segments are at (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4). Tail is at (3,4).\n> \n> Now, for turn 21, I need to choose a move: U, D, L.\n> \n> Possible moves from (1,6):\n> \n> - U: up to (1,7) — but y=7 is a wall, so invalid, collision.\n> \n> - D: down to (1,5) — is this valid? (1,5) is within bounds, x=1, y=5, not wall? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=5 is fine. Also, not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4). (1,5) is not in this list, so empty. Also, no obstacle? Internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2).

But is it a collision? Head moving to a body segment is deadly, except if it's the tail and we're eating food or something? Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a body segment other than the tail is collision.

That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but I need to confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, I think. x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x: 1 to 6, y: 1 to 6. Yes, 6x6 grid? No: x from 1 to 6 is 6 cells, y from 1 to 6 is 6 cells, so 6x6 playable area. But let's list the coordinates: min x=1, max x=6; min y=1, max y=6. So grid size is 6x6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2)]\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,4), then (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5). So the snake has 5 segments.\n> \n> Head direction: Down, which is D. Since it's moving down, from (1,4) to (1,5)? Positions: head (1,4), then (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5). Head is at (1,4), and direction is D, down. Down means decreasing y? Let's clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So U increases y, D decreases y. So y=0 is bottom or top? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. Since U is (x,y+1), that means y increases upwards, I think. But in the wall description, it says y=0 and y=7, so probably y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top? No.\n> \n> Let's think: if U is (x,y+1), and y+1, that means moving up increases y. But walls at y=0 and y=7. So if y=0 is the bottom, then moving up to y+1 would be towards higher y, which might be top. But y=7 is wall, so y=7 is the top row, y=0 is bottom? But positions: snake head at (1,4), which is probably not near bottom.\n> \n> Perhaps the grid has y=0 at bottom, y=7 at top, so cells from y=1 to y=6. U to (x,y+1) moves towards higher y, which is upwards towards y=7 wall. D to (x,y-1) moves towards lower y, downwards towards y=0.\n> \n> Similarly, x: L to (x-1,y), R to (x+1,y), with walls at x=0 and x=7.\n> \n> So for head at (1,4), moving D (down) to (1,3)? But in positions, it has (1,5) and (1,6), which have higher y, so if head was at (1,4) and moved to (1,5), that would be U, not D. But head direction is given as D, down.\n> \n> Current head position: (1,4). Direction is D, meaning it was moving down to get to (1,4)? Let's see the positions: [(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)]\n> \n> The head is the first in the list, so (1,4) is current head. The next segment is (1,5), which is above it (since y=5 > y=4, so higher y), and then (1,6) above that. Then (2,6), and (2,5) which is below (2,6)? (2,6) to (2,5) is down, decreasing y.\n> \n> But the head is at (1,4), and the direction it is facing is D, meaning it just moved down to (1,4) from where? From the previous position. The positions list: head (1,4), then body (1,5), so the head is below the first body segment. Since (1,5) has y=5, (1,4) has y=4, so head is at lower y, meaning it was moving down to get there.\n> \n> Previous head position: before moving to (1,4), it was at (1,5) or something? The positions show the current state: head at (1,4), then the segment that was head before is (1,5), so it moved from (1,5) to (1,4), which is down, decreasing y, so direction D is correct.\n> \n> Similarly, from (1,6) to (2,6) might be right, but (1,6) to (2,6) is from (1,6) to (2,6), which is increase x, so right, but in the list, (1,6) is after (1,5), so (1,5) to (1,6) was up, but that was earlier.\n> \n> Anyway, current head at (1,4), direction D, so it can move U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since it came from up to down (D), it cannot move up (U) next because that would be reverse. Instant reverse means cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is D, so cannot move U next. Allowed moves: D, L, R. But D would be continuing down, L left, R right.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (1,4):\n> \n> - U: to (1,5) - but this is reverse, not allowed because current direction is D, U is opposite.\n> \n> - D: to (1,3)\n> \n> - L: to (0,4) - but x=0 is wall, cannot.\n> \n> - R: to (2,4)\n> \n> So possible actions: D to (1,3) or R to (2,4)\n> \n> Cannot move U or L because U reverse, L wall.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (6,6,3,1) meaning (x=6,y=6), life span=3, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,2,6,1) (x=4,y=2), life span=6, value=1\n> \n> - (5,1,9,1) (x=5,y=1), life span=9, value=1\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: decreases each turn, including current, so for (6,6) life span 3, it will disappear after 3 turns, meaning on turn 23,24,25 it exists, gone on turn 26? Life span decreases every turn, so if life span is N at turn t, it exists for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1? Let's see the rule: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is N, it has N turns left including current, so it will be gone after turn t + N - 1? Example: suppose at turn t, life span N, then after one turn, at t+1, life span is N-1, and so on, until life span 0, then it disappears. So it exists when life span >=1.\n> \n> At turn t, life span N, it exists for this turn and N-1 more turns, so total N turns from now.\n> \n> For (6,6): life span 3 at turn 23, so exists on turns 23,24,25. Gone on turn 26.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2): life span 6, exists turns 23 to 28.\n> \n> (5,1): life span 9, exists turns 23 to 31.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head (1,4), body: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n> \n> So the cells occupied by snake: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, from current position (1,4), possible moves: D to (1,3) or R to (2,4)\n> \n> I need to evaluate these options.\n> \n> Also, the grid has obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2)\n> \n> List obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2)\n> \n> And walls at borders.\n> \n> Now, let's sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Obstacles at: (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (3,6), (4,5)\n> \n> (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) are close.\n> \n> Snake at: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n> \n> So row y=4: (1,4) snake head\n> \n> y=5: (1,5) snake, (2,5) snake tail?

But when moving to a cell, if it's not occupied by body except tail, but tail moves, so it's ok to move to tail cell because tail will advance.\n> \n> But there's a special case: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision because after eating, tail doesn't move, so head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Here, tail is at (2,5). Head at (1,4). Are they adjacent? (1,4) and (2,5): dx=1, dy=1, so diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing side, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n> \n> So (1,4) adjacent cells: (1,3), (1,5), (2,4), (0,4) wall. (1,5) is body, occupied, so cannot move there. (2,4) is possible, (1,3) possible.\n> \n> (1,5) is directly above, body, so moving U would hit body, but U is not possible anyway because reverse not allowed.\n> \n> Tail at (2,5), which is not adjacent to head, since (1,4) to (2,5) is diagonal.\n> \n> So no immediate tail food danger.\n> \n> Now, food on tail: but food can be under body, only eaten when head moves to it after body moves away.\n> \n> But here, no food mentioned under snake, I think.\n> \n> Food positions are given, not under snake.\n> \n> (6,6), (4,2), (5,1) none of these are snake positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n> \n> Food: (6,6) - but (6,6) is not occupied? (2,6) and (1,6) are at y=6, x=1 and 2, but (6,6) is different.\n> \n> (4,2) x=4,y=2, not occupied.\n> \n> (5,1) x=5,y=1, not occupied.\n> \n> So all food is free.\n> \n> Now, back to moves from (1,4):\n> \n> Option 1: Move D to (1,3)\n> \n> Then head to (1,3), snake becomes [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)] and tail (2,5) is removed? When snake moves without eating, tail moves away.\n> \n> After move: head to new position, each segment moves to next position.\n> \n> From current: positions [H: (1,4), B1: (1,5), B2: (1,6), B3: (2,6), T: (2,5)]\n> \n> If move D to (1,3), new head (1,3), then B1 to (1,4), B2 to (1,5), B3 to (1,6), and T (2,5) is removed, but B3 was (2,6) moving to (1,6), which was occupied by B2, but when moving, all segments shift, so (1,6) is now free because B2 moves to? Let's think: the new body is: after head moves to (1,3), the first body segment goes to where head was, (1,4), second body to where first body was, (1,5), third body to where second was, (1,6), and tail to where third body was, (2,6). Since there are four body segments after head, but snake has 5 segments: head and four body? Positions list has 5 elements: index 0 head, 1,2,3,4 body, but index 4 is tail.\n> \n> Generally, when snake moves to new cell without eating, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So new positions: head to (1,3)\n> \n> Then segment 1 (was at (1,5)) moves to where head was, (1,4)\n> \n> Segment 2 (was at (1,6)) moves to where segment 1 was, (1,5)\n> \n> Segment 3 (was at (2,6)) moves to where segment 2 was, (1,6)\n> \n> Segment 4 (tail, was at (2,5)) moves to where segment 3 was, (2,6)\n> \n> So new snake: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)]\n> \n> Tail at (2,6)\n> \n> And (2,5) is now free.\n> \n> If it eats food, then it grows, so tail doesn't move, new segment added at tail position.\n> \n> But no food at (1,3) or (2,4), so no eating now.\n> \n> Similarly, if move R to (2,4): head to (2,4), then body: segment 1 to (1,4), segment 2 to (1,5), segment 3 to (1,6), segment 4 to (2,6)?

No, when moving, we move sequentially.\n> \n> After head to (2,4), segment 1 moves to previous head (1,4), segment 2 to previous segment 1 position (1,5), segment 3 to previous segment 2 position (1,6), segment 4 to previous segment 3 position (2,6).\n> \n> Previous segment 3 position is (2,6), so segment 4 moves to (2,6).\n> \n> And previous segment 4 position (2,5) is free.\n> \n> New snake: [(2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)]\n> \n> Now, from here, I need to plan multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, food locations: (6,6) with short life, only 3 turns left, (4,2) with 6 turns, (5,1) with 9 turns.\n> \n> (6,6) is at top-right, and it will disappear soon, on turn 26.\n> \n> Turn 23,24,25 it exists.\n> \n> Current turn 23, so if I want to eat (6,6), I need to get there within 3 turns.\n> \n> But head at (1,4), (6,6) is far.\n> \n> Distance: delta x = 5, delta y = 2, so Manhattan distance 7, which is more than 3, so impossible to reach in 3 turns from (1,4). Minimum path is 7 moves, but in 3 turns I can only move 3 steps, so max distance 3, but |dx|=5, |dy|=2, min moves 7, so cannot reach (6,6) before it disappears. So I should ignore (6,6) since it's too far.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) and (5,1) have longer life.\n> \n> (4,2) life span 6, exists until turn 28 (23+6-1=28?

That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but I need to confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, I think. x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x: 1 to 6, y: 1 to 6. Yes, 6x6 grid? No: x from 1 to 6 is 6 cells, y from 1 to 6 is 6 cells, so 6x6 playable area. But let's list the coordinates: min x=1, max x=6; min y=1, max y=6. So grid size is 6x6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2)]\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,4), then (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5). So the snake has 5 segments.\n> \n> Head direction: Down, which is D. Since it's moving down, from (1,4) to (1,5)? Positions: head (1,4), then (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5). Head is at (1,4), and direction is D, down. Down means decreasing y? Let's clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So U increases y, D decreases y. So y=0 is bottom or top? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. Since U is (x,y+1), that means y increases upwards, I think. But in the wall description, it says y=0 and y=7, so probably y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top? No.\n> \n> Let's think: if U is (x,y+1), and y+1, that means moving up increases y. But walls at y=0 and y=7. So if y=0 is the bottom, then moving up to y+1 would be towards higher y, which might be top. But y=7 is wall, so y=7 is the top row, y=0 is bottom? But positions: snake head at (1,4), which is probably not near bottom.\n> \n> Perhaps the grid has y=0 at bottom, y=7 at top, so cells from y=1 to y=6. U to (x,y+1) moves towards higher y, which is upwards towards y=7 wall. D to (x,y-1) moves towards lower y, downwards towards y=0.\n> \n> Similarly, x: L to (x-1,y), R to (x+1,y), with walls at x=0 and x=7.\n> \n> So for head at (1,4), moving D (down) to (1,3)? But in positions, it has (1,5) and (1,6), which have higher y, so if head was at (1,4) and moved to (1,5), that would be U, not D. But head direction is given as D, down.\n> \n> Current head position: (1,4). Direction is D, meaning it was moving down to get to (1,4)? Let's see the positions: [(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)]\n> \n> The head is the first in the list, so (1,4) is current head. The next segment is (1,5), which is above it (since y=5 > y=4, so higher y), and then (1,6) above that. Then (2,6), and (2,5) which is below (2,6)? (2,6) to (2,5) is down, decreasing y.\n> \n> But the head is at (1,4), and the direction it is facing is D, meaning it just moved down to (1,4) from where? From the previous position. The positions list: head (1,4), then body (1,5), so the head is below the first body segment. Since (1,5) has y=5, (1,4) has y=4, so head is at lower y, meaning it was moving down to get there.\n> \n> Previous head position: before moving to (1,4), it was at (1,5) or something? The positions show the current state: head at (1,4), then the segment that was head before is (1,5), so it moved from (1,5) to (1,4), which is down, decreasing y, so direction D is correct.\n> \n> Similarly, from (1,6) to (2,6) might be right, but (1,6) to (2,6) is from (1,6) to (2,6), which is increase x, so right, but in the list, (1,6) is after (1,5), so (1,5) to (1,6) was up, but that was earlier.\n> \n> Anyway, current head at (1,4), direction D, so it can move U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since it came from up to down (D), it cannot move up (U) next because that would be reverse. Instant reverse means cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is D, so cannot move U next. Allowed moves: D, L, R. But D would be continuing down, L left, R right.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (1,4):\n> \n> - U: to (1,5) - but this is reverse, not allowed because current direction is D, U is opposite.\n> \n> - D: to (1,3)\n> \n> - L: to (0,4) - but x=0 is wall, cannot.\n> \n> - R: to (2,4)\n> \n> So possible actions: D to (1,3) or R to (2,4)\n> \n> Cannot move U or L because U reverse, L wall.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (6,6,3,1) meaning (x=6,y=6), life span=3, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,2,6,1) (x=4,y=2), life span=6, value=1\n> \n> - (5,1,9,1) (x=5,y=1), life span=9, value=1\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: decreases each turn, including current, so for (6,6) life span 3, it will disappear after 3 turns, meaning on turn 23,24,25 it exists, gone on turn 26? Life span decreases every turn, so if life span is N at turn t, it exists for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1? Let's see the rule: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is N, it has N turns left including current, so it will be gone after turn t + N - 1? Example: suppose at turn t, life span N, then after one turn, at t+1, life span is N-1, and so on, until life span 0, then it disappears. So it exists when life span >=1.\n> \n> At turn t, life span N, it exists for this turn and N-1 more turns, so total N turns from now.\n> \n> For (6,6): life span 3 at turn 23, so exists on turns 23,24,25. Gone on turn 26.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2): life span 6, exists turns 23 to 28.\n> \n> (5,1): life span 9, exists turns 23 to 31.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head (1,4), body: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n> \n> So the cells occupied by snake: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, from current position (1,4), possible moves: D to (1,3) or R to (2,4)\n> \n> I need to evaluate these options.\n> \n> Also, the grid has obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2)\n> \n> List obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2)\n> \n> And walls at borders.\n> \n> Now, let's sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Obstacles at: (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (3,6), (4,5)\n> \n> (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) are close.\n> \n> Snake at: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n> \n> So row y=4: (1,4) snake head\n> \n> y=5: (1,5) snake, (2,5) snake tail?

But when moving to a cell, if it's not occupied by body except tail, but tail moves, so it's ok to move to tail cell because tail will advance.\n> \n> But there's a special case: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision because after eating, tail doesn't move, so head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Here, tail is at (2,5). Head at (1,4). Are they adjacent? (1,4) and (2,5): dx=1, dy=1, so diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing side, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n> \n> So (1,4) adjacent cells: (1,3), (1,5), (2,4), (0,4) wall. (1,5) is body, occupied, so cannot move there. (2,4) is possible, (1,3) possible.\n> \n> (1,5) is directly above, body, so moving U would hit body, but U is not possible anyway because reverse not allowed.\n> \n> Tail at (2,5), which is not adjacent to head, since (1,4) to (2,5) is diagonal.\n> \n> So no immediate tail food danger.\n> \n> Now, food on tail: but food can be under body, only eaten when head moves to it after body moves away.\n> \n> But here, no food mentioned under snake, I think.\n> \n> Food positions are given, not under snake.\n> \n> (6,6), (4,2), (5,1) none of these are snake positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n> \n> Food: (6,6) - but (6,6) is not occupied? (2,6) and (1,6) are at y=6, x=1 and 2, but (6,6) is different.\n> \n> (4,2) x=4,y=2, not occupied.\n> \n> (5,1) x=5,y=1, not occupied.\n> \n> So all food is free.\n> \n> Now, back to moves from (1,4):\n> \n> Option 1: Move D to (1,3)\n> \n> Then head to (1,3), snake becomes [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)] and tail (2,5) is removed? When snake moves without eating, tail moves away.\n> \n> After move: head to new position, each segment moves to next position.\n> \n> From current: positions [H: (1,4), B1: (1,5), B2: (1,6), B3: (2,6), T: (2,5)]\n> \n> If move D to (1,3), new head (1,3), then B1 to (1,4), B2 to (1,5), B3 to (1,6), and T (2,5) is removed, but B3 was (2,6) moving to (1,6), which was occupied by B2, but when moving, all segments shift, so (1,6) is now free because B2 moves to? Let's think: the new body is: after head moves to (1,3), the first body segment goes to where head was, (1,4), second body to where first body was, (1,5), third body to where second was, (1,6), and tail to where third body was, (2,6). Since there are four body segments after head, but snake has 5 segments: head and four body? Positions list has 5 elements: index 0 head, 1,2,3,4 body, but index 4 is tail.\n> \n> Generally, when snake moves to new cell without eating, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So new positions: head to (1,3)\n> \n> Then segment 1 (was at (1,5)) moves to where head was, (1,4)\n> \n> Segment 2 (was at (1,6)) moves to where segment 1 was, (1,5)\n> \n> Segment 3 (was at (2,6)) moves to where segment 2 was, (1,6)\n> \n> Segment 4 (tail, was at (2,5)) moves to where segment 3 was, (2,6)\n> \n> So new snake: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)]\n> \n> Tail at (2,6)\n> \n> And (2,5) is now free.\n> \n> If it eats food, then it grows, so tail doesn't move, new segment added at tail position.\n> \n> But no food at (1,3) or (2,4), so no eating now.\n> \n> Similarly, if move R to (2,4): head to (2,4), then body: segment 1 to (1,4), segment 2 to (1,5), segment 3 to (1,6), segment 4 to (2,6)?

No, when moving, we move sequentially.\n> \n> After head to (2,4), segment 1 moves to previous head (1,4), segment 2 to previous segment 1 position (1,5), segment 3 to previous segment 2 position (1,6), segment 4 to previous segment 3 position (2,6).\n> \n> Previous segment 3 position is (2,6), so segment 4 moves to (2,6).\n> \n> And previous segment 4 position (2,5) is free.\n> \n> New snake: [(2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)]\n> \n> Now, from here, I need to plan multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, food locations: (6,6) with short life, only 3 turns left, (4,2) with 6 turns, (5,1) with 9 turns.\n> \n> (6,6) is at top-right, and it will disappear soon, on turn 26.\n> \n> Turn 23,24,25 it exists.\n> \n> Current turn 23, so if I want to eat (6,6), I need to get there within 3 turns.\n> \n> But head at (1,4), (6,6) is far.\n> \n> Distance: delta x = 5, delta y = 2, so Manhattan distance 7, which is more than 3, so impossible to reach in 3 turns from (1,4). Minimum path is 7 moves, but in 3 turns I can only move 3 steps, so max distance 3, but |dx|=5, |dy|=2, min moves 7, so cannot reach (6,6) before it disappears. So I should ignore (6,6) since it's too far.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) and (5,1) have longer life.\n> \n> (4,2) life span 6, exists until turn 28 (23+6-1=28?

Cannot move L (Left) because it's the opposite of the current direction (R).\n- **Food**:\n  - (6,6): Life span 1 (disappears after this turn; unreachable).\n  - (4,2): Life span 4 (can be eaten on turns 25-28).\n  - (5,1): Life span 7 (can be eaten on turns 25-31).\n  - (6,4): Life span 10 (can be eaten on turns 25-34).\n\n### Immediate Moves:\nFrom (3,4), the possible moves are:\n1. **Right (R) to (4,4)**:\n   - (4,4) is empty (no food, no obstacle, not body).\n   - Moves the snake toward the center and closer to food (6,4).\n2. **Up (U) to (3,5)**:\n   - (3,5) is empty.\n   - Moves the snake upward, but the next move options are limited (cannot go U to (3,6) due to obstacle, cannot go D (reverse), so only L or R).\n3. **Down (D) to (3,3)**:\n   - (3,3) is empty.\n   - Moves the snake downward, closer to food (4,2). From (3,3), can move R to (4,3) next, then D to (4,2) to eat the food on Turn 27.\n\n### Evaluation:\n- **Goal**: Maximize score by eating positive food (all food here is +1) while avoiding risks.\n- **Priority**: Food (4,2) has a short life span (disappears after Turn 28), so it should be prioritized over (5,1) and (6,4).\n- **Best Path to (4,2)**:\n  - Turn 25: D to (3,3).\n  - Turn 26: R to (4,3).\n  - Turn 27: D to (4,2) to eat the food.\n- **Alternative Path to (4,2)**:\n  - Turn 25: R to (4,4).\n  - Turn 26: D to (4,3).\n  - Turn 27: D to (4,2) to eat the food.\n  - This is equally valid but slightly less direct.\n\n### Risks:\n- Moving U to (3,5) limits future options and doesn't directly help reach food quickly.\n- Moving R to (4,4) is safe but delays reaching (4,2) by one turn compared to moving D first.\n- Moving D to (3,3) is the most direct path to (4,2) and avoids dead ends.\n\n### Decision:\nThe most efficient and safe immediate action is to move **Down (D)** to (3,3), setting up the path to eat (4,2) on Turn 27.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right, y=0 bottom, y=7 top? Typically in grids, y increases upwards, but in coordinates, it might vary. I think here, since head direction is R and positions are given, I should assume standard Cartesian: x right, y up?

Positions are head first, so at turn 24, head was at (2,4) moving right to (3,4) at turn 25? Let's see the state.\n> \n> Current turn is t1=25, snake positions are given for turn 25: head (3,4), then body (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). Head direction is R, meaning that at turn 25, the head is at (3,4) and it was moving right to get there. So for the next move, I need to choose where to go from (3,4).\n> \n> Available moves from (3,4): since head direction is R, I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so I cannot move left (L) because that would be opposite to current direction R. Current direction is the direction it was moving to get to current position.\n> \n> Rule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> So from (3,4) with current direction R, I can move U (up), D (down), R (right), but not L (left).\n> \n> Now, possible moves:\n> \n> - Right (R) to (4,4)\n> \n> - Up (U) to (3,5)\n> \n> - Down (D) to (3,3)\n> \n> Cannot move left to (2,4) because that's opposite direction, and also (2,4) is occupied by the body, but since it's the tail, I might be able to move there if the tail moves, but rule says I can move to tail cell only if tail moves away, but for collision, head can move to tail cell because tail moves forward.\n> \n> Collision rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to a body segment is deadly except for the tail cell, if the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, from (3,4), moving left to (2,4) would be moving to the tail? Let's see the body positions: segments are (3,4) head, then (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). So (2,4) is the neck, not tail. Tail is (1,6).\n> \n> If I move left to (2,4), that's where the second segment is, so it would be a body collision because when I move, the head goes to (2,4), but at that moment, before tail moves, (2,4) is occupied by the second segment, so it's a collision. Only if I move to the current tail position, and the tail moves away, it's safe.\n> \n> But here, (2,4) is not the tail; tail is (1,6). So moving to (2,4) would cause collision with the body segment there.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any other body segment is deadly.\n> \n> Now, possible cells to move to from (3,4):\n> \n> - Right: (4,4) - is this free?

Distance is |6-3| + |6-4| = 3+2=5, too far. So impossible to eat (6,6) this turn. Since life span is 1, it will disappear after this turn, so I can't eat it at all. So ignore (6,6).\n> \n> - (4,2) value 1, life span 4: so it will disappear after turn 25 + 4 = turn 29? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 25, life span is 4, so after turn 25, it decreases to 3, then 2, then 1, then 0 at turn 29, so it disappears after turn 29, meaning it can be eaten from turn 25 to 28 inclusive? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span L, it exists for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at the start of turn t+L?

When the snake moves, if head is on food, it is eaten. After the move, countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> But for eating, it happens during the move.\n> \n> Standard in snake: when head moves to a cell with food, it eats it and grows.\n> \n> Then after eating, the food is removed, and snake grows.\n> \n> But here, life span decreases after each turn.\n> \n> So for food at (4,2) with life span 4 at turn 25: during turn 25, if I move to it, I eat it. After turn 25, life span decreases to 3.

Distance is |6-3| + |6-4| = 3+2=5, too far. So impossible to eat (6,6) this turn. Since life span is 1, it will disappear after this turn, so I can't eat it at all. So ignore (6,6).\n> \n> - (4,2) value 1, life span 4: so it will disappear after turn 25 + 4 = turn 29?

Let's clarify.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span L, it exists for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at the start of turn t+L? Or after?\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, countdown is L, then after turn t, it becomes L-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the beginning of turn, food with countdown >0 is present. When the snake moves, if head is on food, it is eaten. After the move, countdown decreases by 1.

Internal obstacles are at (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), and (2,2). I need to avoid these cells.\n> \n> - Snake positions: Head is at (4,3), then body segments at (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4). So the snake is 5 units long. Head direction is R (right), meaning it moved right to get to (4,3).\n> \n> - Food items:\n> - (4,2) with value 1 and life span 3.

Snake positions: head (4,3), body (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4). So (4,4) is not in the body list. Walls: internal obstacles include (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). (4,4) is not listed as a wall. Border walls are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (4,4) is within bounds. So (4,4) should be safe to move to, but I need to consider if moving there causes future collision.\n> \n> - (4,2): Food is at (4,2), which is positive. But (4,2) is also an internal obstacle? Walls are given: internal obstacles are (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). (4,2) is not listed, so it should be free. Food can be on cells, and walls are separate. So (4,2) has food, not a wall.

It says: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide. Tail is at (1,4). Head is at (4,3), which is not adjacent to (1,4). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right. (4,3) to (1,4) is not adjacent; distance is |4-1|=3 in x, |3-4|=1 in y, so not adjacent. Tail is at (1,4), and food is at (4,2), not on tail. So no issue with tail reward danger here.\n> \n> But (4,2) is directly below head, and if I move down, I go to (4,2) and eat the food. Life span is 3, so it disappears after turn 29.

No food at (4,1), so snake moves: head to (4,1), then body: (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4). Tail (1,4) moves off, so [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)]? Length was 6, after no eat, tail moves, so segments: head new position, then previous head, then the bodies except the tail is removed? Standard: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So after turn 28 move to (4,1) no eat: positions: head (4,1), then body: (4,2) (previous head), then (4,3), (3,3), (3,4). (2,4) was tail, removed. So snake: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)] with length 5? Original length 5, ate on turn 27, became 6, then on turn 28 no eat, so after move, length 5 again? No.\n> \n> Turn 27: start length 5, move and eat, so after turn 27, length 6: positions [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)]\n> \n> Turn 28: move to (4,1), no food there, so head moves to (4,1), then the body segments: the segment that was at (4,2) moves to where head was? No: the new body positions: the first body segment is the previous head position, (4,2), then the segment that was at (4,3) moves to (4,2)? Let's think of the list.\n> \n> After move: new head at (4,1), then the previous positions except the tail is removed if no eat, but since no eat, the tail is removed.\n> \n> So the body segments are: the old head becomes new first body, old first body becomes new second body, etc., and the old tail is removed.\n> \n> So from list: old positions: head (4,2), body1 (4,3), body2 (3,3), body3 (3,4), body4 (2,4), tail (1,4)\n> \n> After moving head to (4,1) no eat: new head (4,1), new body1: old head (4,2), new body2: old body1 (4,3), new body3: old body2 (3,3), new body4: old body3 (3,4), and old body4 (2,4) is not included, tail removed. Old body4 is (2,4), which was not the last? Positions: index 0 head, 1 body, 2 body, 3 body, 4 tail? In the list, [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)] so six segments: head at index 0, then body segments at 1,2,3,4, tail at 5? Typically, the list has head at position 0, then the body in order, with tail at the end.\n> \n> In input: snake positions: [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] head first, so index 0 head, index 1 first body, index 2 second body, ..., index n-1 tail.\n> \n> For turn 27 after eating: positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)] so head (4,2), body segments (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), tail (1,4).\n> \n> Turn 28: move to (4,1) no food. Head moves to (4,1). Then, the new body segments: the previous positions except the tail is removed. So new positions: head (4,1), then body: previous head (4,2), then previous body1 (4,3), previous body2 (3,3), previous body3 (3,4), and previous body4 (2,4) becomes new body4, but previous tail (1,4) is removed, so we have head and four bodies? List: new head (4,1), new body1 (4,2), new body2 (4,3), new body3 (3,3), new body4 (3,4), and (2,4) was previous body4, but it is included, and tail (1,4) removed. Since no eat, the snake length decreases? No, when you don't eat, the snake moves forward, so the tail cell is vacated, but the length remains the same, only the head moves to a new cell, and the tail is removed, so length decreases by one? That can't be right.\n> \n> I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> Standard snake game: when you don't eat food, you move the head to a new cell, and the tail is removed, so the length stays the same. When you eat, you move head to food, and tail is not removed, so length increases by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions, for a snake of length L, when no eat, after move, the new positions are: new head position, then the first L-1 positions of the old list. The last position (tail) is removed.\n> \n> For example, initial length 5: positions [A,B,C,D,E] where A head, E tail.\n> \n> Move to new head F, no eat: new positions [F, A, B, C, D] so tail E removed, length still 5.\n> \n> If eat, new positions [F, A, B, C, D, E] but E was tail, now it stays, so length 6.\n> \n> In this case, turn 27 start: positions [(4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)] length 5.\n> \n> Turn 27 move to (4,2) and eat food: so new positions [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)] length 6.\n> \n> Turn 28 move to (4,1) no food: new head (4,1), then old head (4,2), old body1 (4,3), old body2 (3,3), old body3 (3,4), and old body4 (2,4) becomes new body4, but old tail (1,4) is removed. Old positions: index 0 (4,2) head, index 1 (4,3) body1, index 2 (3,3) body2, index 3 (3,4) body3, index 4 (2,4) body4, index 5 (1,4) tail.\n> \n> After move no eat: new head (4,1), then new body1: old head (4,2), new body2: old body1 (4,3), new body3: old body2 (3,3), new body4: old body3 (3,4), new body5: old body4 (2,4), and old tail (1,4) removed. Since length was 6, after no eat, it should be length 5, so only five positions: new head, and the first four bodies, but old body4 is included, and tail removed.\n> \n> Positions: new head (4,1), new body1: old head (4,2), new body2: old body1 (4,3), new body3: old body2 (3,3), new body4: old body3 (3,4), and old body4 (2,4) is not included because it was the last body before tail, but in the list, old body4 is at index 4, which is part of the body, and tail at index 5.\n> \n> After move, new positions are: new head, then the old positions from index 0 to L-2, where L is old length.\n> \n> Old length 6, indices 0 to 5.\n> \n> New positions: new head, then old index 0, old index 1, old index 2, old index 3, old index 4. Old index 5 (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)? But (2,4) is old index 4, which was body4, and old index 5 tail removed, so new positions: head (4,1), body1 (4,2), body2 (4,3), body3 (3,3), body4 (3,4), and tail (2,4)? No, the last one is the tail.\n> \n> List: new head (4,1), then old head (4,2), old body1 (4,3), old body2 (3,3), old body3 (3,4), and old body4 (2,4) becomes new body4 or tail? Since old length 6, after no eat, new length 5, so positions: new head, and old positions 0 to 3, which are old head and first three bodies, but old positions 0 to 3 are (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), and old position 4 (2,4) is not included, old position 5 removed.\n> \n> Standard: the new body consists of the old head position followed by the old body positions except the last one if no eat.\n> \n> I think it's better to think that the new positions are [new_head] + old_positions[:-1] if no eat, or [new_head] + old_positions if eat.\n> \n> For no eat: new positions = [new_head] + old_positions[0:-1]  (removes the tail)\n> \n> For eat: new positions = [new_head] + old_positions  (keeps tail, so length increases)\n> \n> In this case, turn 28: old positions [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)] move to (4,1) no eat, so new positions = [ (4,1) ] + [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)] = [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)] but this has 6 positions, but we removed the tail (1,4), so it should be length 5, but here we have head and 5 bodies? [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4) ] that's 6 cells, but after no eat, length should decrease by 1? No, when no eat, the snake moves, so the head moves to new cell, the tail is removed, so the length stays the same, but the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> In terms of number of segments, if length was L, after no eat, still L segments, but the tail position changes.\n> \n> In the list, for a snake of length L, there are L positions.\n> \n> After no eat move, the new list has L positions: new head and the first L-1 positions of the old list.\n> \n> Old list has L positions, new list has L positions: new head at position 0, then old position 0 at new position 1, old position 1 at new position 2, ..., old position L-2 at new position L-1. Old position L-1 (tail) is removed.\n> \n> For example, L=5, old [A,B,C,D,E] A head E tail.\n> \n> Move to F no eat: new [F, A, B, C, D] so E removed.\n> \n> If eat, new [F, A, B, C, D, E] length L+1.\n> \n> In our case, turn 27 after eat: L=6, positions P = [P0=(4,2), P1=(4,3), P2=(3,3), P3=(3,4), P4=(2,4), P5=(1,4)] P0 head, P5 tail.\n> \n> Turn 28 move to (4,1) no eat: new head (4,1), then new body: old P0, P1, P2, P3, P4. So new positions: [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4) ] and old P5 (1,4) removed. But this has 6 positions, but P4 (2,4) is now the tail, so length still 6? No, after no eat, length should be the same, but here from L=6 to new L=6, but we added new head and kept all except tail, so it's L positions.\n> \n> In new list, new head (4,1), then old head (4,2), then old body1 (4,3), old body2 (3,3), old body3 (3,4), old body4 (2,4), so the last is (2,4), which was body4, now tail. Length 6, same as before, but no growth, so length should be 6 still, but the snake didn't grow, so positions shifted, tail moved.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> When no food is eaten, the snake moves forward, so the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves off its cell, so the number of segments remains the same.

Snake positions: head (4,3), body (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4). So (4,4) is not in the body list. Walls: internal obstacles include (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). (4,4) is not listed as a wall.

It says: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide. Tail is at (1,4). Head is at (4,3), which is not adjacent to (1,4). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right. (4,3) to (1,4) is not adjacent; distance is |4-1|=3 in x, |3-4|=1 in y, so not adjacent. Tail is at (1,4), and food is at (4,2), not on tail. So no issue with tail reward danger here.\n> \n> But (4,2) is directly below head, and if I move down, I go to (4,2) and eat the food. Life span is 3, so it disappears after turn 29.

Movement: head moves to new position, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So if no eat, from [(4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)] move R: head to (5,3), then body: (4,3) to where head was, but segments shift: new positions: head (5,3), then body: (4,3) (which was head), then (3,3) (which was first body), then (3,4), then (2,4). Tail was (1,4), but since no eat, tail moves off, so snake becomes [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)] with length 5, tail at (2,4).\n> \n> Similarly, if move U to (4,4): head to (4,4), then body: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), and tail (1,4) moves off, so [(4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)]\n> \n> Now, let's consider the food.\n> \n> Food at (4,2) has short life, only 3 turns left, so I might want to eat it soon.\n> \n> But is it safe? Moving to (4,2) might be risky if it traps me or something.\n> \n> Let's see the surroundings.\n> \n> From (4,2), possible moves: since head at (4,2), and I moved D, so previous direction was down? After moving to (4,2), the head direction is D, so I can move U, D, L, R except reverse, which would be U? Reverse of down is up, so I cannot move up immediately after moving down? No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is head direction, which is given as R for this turn. After I move, the direction changes.\n> \n> For this turn, t=27, head direction is R, so I can move U, D, R, not L.\n> \n> After move, the new head direction is the direction I just moved.\n> \n> So if I move D to (4,2) on turn 27, then on turn 28, head direction is D, so I cannot move U (opposite), can move D, L, R.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move R to (5,3), on turn 28 head direction R, can move U, D, R, not L.\n> \n> If move U to (4,4), head direction U, can move U, L, R, not D.\n> \n> Now, let's think 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> I should consider paths to the foods.\n> \n> First, food at (4,2): very close, below head. I can eat it now by moving D.\n> \n> But after eating, I am at (4,2), with walls around. Internal obstacles: (3,2) is a wall, (3,1) wall, (2,2) wall. So around (4,2): up to (4,3) is body? After eating, positions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (3,3), etc.\n> \n> From (4,2), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (4,3) - occupied by body segment (since after move, (4,3) is the first body segment)\n> \n> - Down: (4,1) - is this wall or free? y=1, x=4. Borders: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is not border wall. Internal obstacles: (3,1) is wall, but (4,1) is not listed. Internal obstacles are (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). (4,1) not there, so free? But (3,1) is wall, but (4,1) is different cell.\n> \n> (4,1) should be free, but let's confirm walls: border walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles are specific cells: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). So (4,1) is not occupied by wall, so it should be free.\n> \n> - Left: (3,2) - but (3,2) is an internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - Right: (5,2) - not wall, not occupied, should be free.\n> \n> So from (4,2) after eating, I can move to (4,1) down or (5,2) right, not up or left.\n> \n> If I move down to (4,1), then from there, possible moves: head at (4,1), direction D.\n> \n> Then can move D, L, R? Reverse of down is up, so cannot move up.\n> \n> But (4,0) is y=0, border wall, so cannot move down to (4,0).\n> \n> Left to (3,1): (3,1) is internal obstacle, wall.\n> \n> Right to (5,1): (5,1) has food! But let's see.\n> \n> (5,1) is a food position.\n> \n> But moving to (5,1) from (4,1) would be right, so possible.\n> \n> But I need to get to (4,1) first.\n> \n> From (4,2), if I move right to (5,2), then from (5,2) I can go to (5,1) or other places.\n> \n> But let's not get ahead.\n> \n> First, if I eat (4,2) now on turn 27, I am at (4,2) with few options.\n> \n> Then on turn 28, from (4,2), I can move D to (4,1) or R to (5,2).\n> \n> If I move D to (4,1), then on turn 28, head at (4,1), direction D.\n> \n> Then turn 29: from (4,1), cannot move up (reverse), cannot move down to (4,0) wall, cannot move left to (3,1) wall, so only possible move is right to (5,1).\n> \n> (5,1) has food, so I can eat it on turn 29.\n> \n> But life span of (5,1) is 5, turns left: from turn 27, it has 5 turns, so on turn 29 it's still there? Turn 27,28,29,30,31; after turn 31 it disappears. So on turn 29 it can be eaten.\n> \n> After eating at (5,1), snake grows, etc.\n> \n> But from (4,1) to (5,1) is right, so I move to (5,1) on turn 29, eat food.\n> \n> Then head at (5,1), direction R.\n> \n> Now, from (5,1), possible moves: U to (5,2), D to (5,0) but y=0 wall, left to (4,1), right to (6,1).\n> \n> (4,1) was just vacated? But when I move, body segments shift.\n> \n> Let's trace positions.\n> \n> Start turn 27: snake [(4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)]\n> \n> Turn 27: move D to (4,2), eat food, so snake grows: [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)]\n> \n> Turn 28: move D to (4,1). No food at (4,1), so snake moves: head to (4,1), then body: (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4). Tail (1,4) moves off, so [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)]? Length was 6, after no eat, tail moves, so segments: head new position, then previous head, then the bodies except the tail is removed? Standard: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So after turn 28 move to (4,1) no eat: positions: head (4,1), then body: (4,2) (previous head), then (4,3), (3,3), (3,4). (2,4) was tail, removed. So snake: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)] with length 5? Original length 5, ate on turn 27, became 6, then on turn 28 no eat, so after move, length 5 again? No.\n> \n> Turn 27: start length 5, move and eat, so after turn 27, length 6: positions [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)]\n> \n> Turn 28: move to (4,1), no food there, so head moves to (4,1), then the body segments: the segment that was at (4,2) moves to where head was? No: the new body positions: the first body segment is the previous head position, (4,2), then the segment that was at (4,3) moves to (4,2)? Let's think of the list.\n> \n> After move: new head at (4,1), then the previous positions except the tail is removed if no eat, but since no eat, the tail is removed.\n> \n> So the body segments are: the old head becomes new first body, old first body becomes new second body, etc., and the old tail is removed.\n> \n> So from list: old positions: head (4,2), body1 (4,3), body2 (3,3), body3 (3,4), body4 (2,4), tail (1,4)\n> \n> After moving head to (4,1) no eat: new head (4,1), new body1: old head (4,2), new body2: old body1 (4,3), new body3: old body2 (3,3), new body4: old body3 (3,4), and old body4 (2,4) is not included, tail removed. Old body4 is (2,4), which was not the last? Positions: index 0 head, 1 body, 2 body, 3 body, 4 tail? In the list, [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)] so six segments: head at index 0, then body segments at 1,2,3,4, tail at 5? Typically, the list has head at position 0, then the body in order, with tail at the end.\n> \n> In input: snake positions: [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] head first, so index 0 head, index 1 first body, index 2 second body, ..., index n-1 tail.\n> \n> For turn 27 after eating: positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)] so head (4,2), body segments (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), tail (1,4).\n> \n> Turn 28: move to (4,1) no food. Head moves to (4,1). Then, the new body segments: the previous positions except the tail is removed. So new positions: head (4,1), then body: previous head (4,2), then previous body1 (4,3), previous body2 (3,3), previous body3 (3,4), and previous body4 (2,4) becomes new body4, but previous tail (1,4) is removed, so we have head and four bodies? List: new head (4,1), new body1 (4,2), new body2 (4,3), new body3 (3,3), new body4 (3,4), and (2,4) was previous body4, but it is included, and tail (1,4) removed. Since no eat, the snake length decreases? No, when you don't eat, the snake moves forward, so the tail cell is vacated, but the length remains the same, only the head moves to a new cell, and the tail is removed, so length decreases by one? That can't be right.\n> \n> I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> Standard snake game: when you don't eat food, you move the head to a new cell, and the tail is removed, so the length stays the same. When you eat, you move head to food, and tail is not removed, so length increases by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions, for a snake of length L, when no eat, after move, the new positions are: new head position, then the first L-1 positions of the old list. The last position (tail) is removed.\n> \n> For example, initial length 5: positions [A,B,C,D,E] where A head, E tail.\n> \n> Move to new head F, no eat: new positions [F, A, B, C, D] so tail E removed, length still 5.\n> \n> If eat, new positions [F, A, B, C, D, E] but E was tail, now it stays, so length 6.\n> \n> In this case, turn 27 start: positions [(4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)] length 5.\n> \n> Turn 27 move to (4,2) and eat food: so new positions [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)] length 6.\n> \n> Turn 28 move to (4,1) no food: new head (4,1), then old head (4,2), old body1 (4,3), old body2 (3,3), old body3 (3,4), and old body4 (2,4) becomes new body4, but old tail (1,4) is removed. Old positions: index 0 (4,2) head, index 1 (4,3) body1, index 2 (3,3) body2, index 3 (3,4) body3, index 4 (2,4) body4, index 5 (1,4) tail.\n> \n> After move no eat: new head (4,1), then new body1: old head (4,2), new body2: old body1 (4,3), new body3: old body2 (3,3), new body4: old body3 (3,4), new body5: old body4 (2,4), and old tail (1,4) removed. Since length was 6, after no eat, it should be length 5, so only five positions: new head, and the first four bodies, but old body4 is included, and tail removed.\n> \n> Positions: new head (4,1), new body1: old head (4,2), new body2: old body1 (4,3), new body3: old body2 (3,3), new body4: old body3 (3,4), and old body4 (2,4) is not included because it was the last body before tail, but in the list, old body4 is at index 4, which is part of the body, and tail at index 5.\n> \n> After move, new positions are: new head, then the old positions from index 0 to L-2, where L is old length.\n> \n> Old length 6, indices 0 to 5.\n> \n> New positions: new head, then old index 0, old index 1, old index 2, old index 3, old index 4. Old index 5 (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)? But (2,4) is old index 4, which was body4, and old index 5 tail removed, so new positions: head (4,1), body1 (4,2), body2 (4,3), body3 (3,3), body4 (3,4), and tail (2,4)? No, the last one is the tail.\n> \n> List: new head (4,1), then old head (4,2), old body1 (4,3), old body2 (3,3), old body3 (3,4), and old body4 (2,4) becomes new body4 or tail? Since old length 6, after no eat, new length 5, so positions: new head, and old positions 0 to 3, which are old head and first three bodies, but old positions 0 to 3 are (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), and old position 4 (2,4) is not included, old position 5 removed.\n> \n> Standard: the new body consists of the old head position followed by the old body positions except the last one if no eat.\n> \n> I think it's better to think that the new positions are [new_head] + old_positions[:-1] if no eat, or [new_head] + old_positions if eat.\n> \n> For no eat: new positions = [new_head] + old_positions[0:-1]  (removes the tail)\n> \n> For eat: new positions = [new_head] + old_positions  (keeps tail, so length increases)\n> \n> In this case, turn 28: old positions [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)] move to (4,1) no eat, so new positions = [ (4,1) ] + [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)] = [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)] but this has 6 positions, but we removed the tail (1,4), so it should be length 5, but here we have head and 5 bodies? [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4) ] that's 6 cells, but after no eat, length should decrease by 1? No, when no eat, the snake moves, so the head moves to new cell, the tail is removed, so the length stays the same, but the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> In terms of number of segments, if length was L, after no eat, still L segments, but the tail position changes.\n> \n> In the list, for a snake of length L, there are L positions.\n> \n> After no eat move, the new list has L positions: new head and the first L-1 positions of the old list.\n> \n> Old list has L positions, new list has L positions: new head at position 0, then old position 0 at new position 1, old position 1 at new position 2, ..., old position L-2 at new position L-1. Old position L-1 (tail) is removed.\n> \n> For example, L=5, old [A,B,C,D,E] A head E tail.\n> \n> Move to F no eat: new [F, A, B, C, D] so E removed.\n> \n> If eat, new [F, A, B, C, D, E] length L+1.\n> \n> In our case, turn 27 after eat: L=6, positions P = [P0=(4,2), P1=(4,3), P2=(3,3), P3=(3,4), P4=(2,4), P5=(1,4)] P0 head, P5 tail.\n> \n> Turn 28 move to (4,1) no eat: new head (4,1), then new body: old P0, P1, P2, P3, P4. So new positions: [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4) ] and old P5 (1,4) removed. But this has 6 positions, but P4 (2,4) is now the tail, so length still 6? No, after no eat, length should be the same, but here from L=6 to new L=6, but we added new head and kept all except tail, so it's L positions.\n> \n> In new list, new head (4,1), then old head (4,2), then old body1 (4,3), old body2 (3,3), old body3 (3,4), old body4 (2,4), so the last is (2,4), which was body4, now tail. Length 6, same as before, but no growth, so length should be 6 still, but the snake didn't grow, so positions shifted, tail moved.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> When no food is eaten, the snake moves forward, so the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves off its cell, so the number of segments remains the same. The new position list is the new head followed by the old head, then the old body up to the second last segment, and the old tail is removed.\n> \n> For a snake of length L, the position list has L elements.\n> \n> After move with no eat: new position list is [new_head] + old_positions[0 to L-2]  because old_positions[0 to L-2] are the head and bodies except the tail.\n> \n> Old_positions[0] is head, old_positions[1] to old_positions[L-2] are bodies, old_positions[L-1] is tail.\n> \n> After move no eat: new positions: new_head, then old_positions[0], old_positions[1], ..., old_positions[L-2]\n> \n> So the new list has new_head followed by the first L-1 old positions, which include the old head and the bodies except the old tail.\n> \n> The number of positions is 1 + (L-1) = L, so length unchanged.\n> \n> The old tail position is vacated.\n> \n> In our case, turn 28: old positions L=6: [ (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) ]\n> \n> Move to (4,1) no eat: new positions = [ (4,1) ] + [ (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4) ] = [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4) ] so head (4,1), body (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), tail (2,4)\n> \n> Old tail (1,4) removed.\n> \n> Then on turn 29, from (4,1), I can move to (5,1) right, since direction is D (from moving down), so can move R.\n> \n> To (5,1), which has food, so eat it.\n> \n> New positions: head to (5,1), then old positions: [ (5,1) ] + [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4) ] = [(5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)] length 7.\n> \n> Then head at (5,1), direction R.\n> \n> Now from (5,1), possible moves: U to (5,2), D to (5,0) wall, L to (4,1) body, R to (6,1).\n> \n> (4,1) is body, so cannot move left.

Since no food eaten, tail moves off (2,4), so new positions: head (5,3), body (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) — tail is (3,4), since (2,4) is left.\n> \n> Original positions: indices: 0:(5,2) head, 1:(4,2), 2:(4,3), 3:(3,3), 4:(3,4), 5:(2,4) tail.\n> \n> After move U to (5,3), no food, so head to (5,3), segment 1: old head (5,2), segment 2: old segment 1 (4,2), segment 3: old segment 2 (4,3), segment 4: old segment 3 (3,3), segment 5: old segment 4 (3,4), and tail old segment 5 (2,4) is gone, so new tail is (3,4).

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State (Turn \\( t_0 = 30 \\))\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state at turn 30 based on the provided information:\n\n1. **Grid Layout**:\n   - **Borders**: Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6).\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). These cells are blocked.\n\n2. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: [(5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)] — head at (5,1), tail at (2,4), length 7.\n   - **Head Direction**: D (down). The snake moved down to reach (5,1) from (5,2).\n\n3. **Food**:\n   - (6,4): value=1, life_span=5\n   - (6,1): value=1, life_span=8\n\n4. **Previous Plan from Turn 29**:\n   - The previous thinking model at turn 29 decided to avoid eating the food at (5,1) (which had a life_span of 3 at that time) to prevent trapping the snake in a corner. Instead, it planned to move towards (6,4) by the sequence: U (to (5,3)), R (to (6,3)), U (to (6,4)), L (to (5,4)).\n   - However, at turn 30, the snake is at (5,1), indicating that the snake did move down to (5,1) at turn 29, contrary to the previous plan's suggestion to move up. This suggests that the previous plan was not followed, or there might be a discrepancy in the state description.\n\nGiven that at turn 30 the snake is at (5,1) with direction D, let's proceed from the current state.\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 30\n\nFrom the current head position (5,1) and direction D, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **U (Up)**: (5,2)\n   - Current direction is D, so moving U is a reverse, which is not allowed.\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n2. **D (Down)**: (5,0)\n   - y=0 is a wall.\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n3. **L (Left)**: (4,1)\n   - Check if (4,1) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=4,y=1 is within bounds and not in the internal obstacles list.\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body: The snake's body segments are at (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4). (4,1) is not in this list.\n     - No food at (4,1).\n   - **Valid**.\n\n4. **R (Right)**: (6,1)\n   - Check if (6,1) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=6,y=1 is within bounds and not an internal obstacle.\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body.\n     - Has food: (6,1) with value=1, life_span=8.\n   - **Valid**.\n\nSo, the valid immediate moves are L to (4,1) or R to (6,1).\n\n### Evaluating Move to (6,1) (Right)\n\nIf we move R to (6,1):\n- Eat the food at (6,1): +1 score, snake length increases to 8.\n- New head position: (6,1), direction R.\n- New body: [(6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)].\n\nNext possible moves from (6,1), direction R:\n- Cannot reverse (L is reverse of R, so no L).\n- U to (6,2):\n  - (6,2) is free (no wall, no body, no food).\n- D to (6,0): wall, invalid.\n- R to (7,1): wall, invalid.\nSo, only U to (6,2).\n\nAfter moving U to (6,2), direction U:\n- Cannot reverse (D is reverse, so no D).\n- U to (6,3):\n  - (6,3) is free.\n- L to (5,2):\n  - (5,2) is body segment, collision.\n- R to (7,2): wall, invalid.\nSo, only U to (6,3).\n\nContinuing this path seems to lead the snake towards the top-right corner, which may eventually trap it, similar to the previous plan's concern.\n\n### Evaluating Move to (4,1) (Left)\n\nIf we move L to (4,1):\n- No food at (4,1), so snake length remains 7.\n- New head position: (4,1), direction L.\n- New body: [(4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)] (tail (2,4) moves off).\n\nNext possible moves from (4,1), direction L:\n- Cannot reverse (R is reverse of L, so no R).\n- U to (4,2):\n  - (4,2) is body segment (second segment after head), collision.\n- D to (4,0): wall, invalid.\n- L to (3,1):\n  - (3,1) is an internal obstacle, wall.\n- No valid moves; snake is stuck.\n- **Dead end**.\n\nThis leads to an immediate dead end, which is fatal.\n\n### Re-evaluating Previous Plan\n\nGiven that moving R leads to potential trapping and moving L leads to immediate death, the previous plan's avoidance of eating (5,1) seems flawed because now the snake is at (5,1) after presumably eating it at turn 29 (since the snake's length is 7, and at turn 29 it was 6 before eating (5,1)).\n\nPerhaps the correct interpretation is that at turn 29, the snake was at (5,2) with direction R, and the plan was to move U to (5,3), but instead, the snake moved D to (5,1), eating the food there, leading to the current state at turn 30.\n\nGiven that, and seeing that moving L is fatal, the only viable immediate move is R to (6,1), despite the long-term trapping risk.\n\n### Checking for Alternative Interpretations\n\nIs there another way to interpret the current state where the snake didn't eat (5,1)? \n\nIf at turn 29 the snake was at (5,2) and did not eat (5,1), then moving D would place the head at (5,1) without eating, meaning the food is under the head, which can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it again. But the current state shows the snake's head at (5,1) with length 7, implying it did grow by eating.\n\nThus, the snake must have eaten (5,1) at turn 29, leading to the current state at turn 30.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the current state at turn 30:\n- The only non-fatal immediate move is R to (6,1), eating the food there.\n- This leads to a path that may eventually trap the snake, but there's no better immediate alternative.\n- Moving L is fatal, and U/D are invalid.\n\nThus, the immediate action at turn 30 should be to move R to (6,1).\n\nHowever, the previous plan suggested avoiding (5,1) to prevent trapping, but since the snake is already at (5,1), the best now is to proceed to (6,1).\n\nBut wait—the food at (5,1) was supposed to disappear after turn 31 (since at turn 29 its life_span was 3: turns 29,30,31). At turn 30, it's still present (life_span decreased to 2 at turn 30, so present at turns 30,31, disappears after).\n\nBut the snake is already at (5,1), so it must have eaten it at turn 29, meaning it's no longer present at turn 30. \n\nWait, no—the food at (5,1) was present at turn 29 with life_span 3, so it's present at turns 29,30,31. If the snake ate it at turn 29, it's no longer present at turn 30. But the current state at turn 30 lists food at (6,4) and (6,1), not (5,1), so it's already gone.\n\nThus, the snake is at (5,1) after having eaten the food there at turn 29, and now at turn 30, the only moves are L to (4,1) (dead end) or R to (6,1) (eat food, potential trap).\n\nGiven that, the only viable move is R to (6,1).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAt turn 30, the immediate action is to move right to (6,1) to eat the food there, as moving left leads to an immediate\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",
