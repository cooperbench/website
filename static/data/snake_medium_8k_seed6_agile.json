Possible moves:\n1. **U (Up)**: (2, 5)\n   - Check: (2, 5) is not a wall (not in borders or internal walls). Valid.\n2. **L (Left)**: (1, 4)\n   - Check: (1, 4) is not a wall.

However:\n- (1, 6) has life_span = 8, will disappear at Turn 10.\n- (1, 2) has life_span = 9, will disappear at Turn 11.\nBoth have plenty of time, so no urgency.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- After eating (1, 6), the snake will be at (1, 6) with tail at (2, 6). Next move must be D to (1, 5) (since U is wall, L is wall, R is reverse).\n- After eating (1, 2), the snake will be at (1, 2) with tail at (1, 3). Next move must be D to (1, 1) (since U is reverse, L is wall, R is wall).\n\nBoth paths lead to valid sequences, but the path via U to (1, 6) seems slightly more straightforward as it avoids the internal wall at (2, 2) that could complicate future moves after eating (1, 2).\n\n### Decision:\nThe best immediate action is to move **Up (U)** to (2, 5), setting up to eat the food at (1, 6) in two more moves.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Let's see if this is still the best option.\n\n**Option 1: Move `L` to `(2, 4)`**\n- Next turn (turn 6), from `(2, 4)` with direction `L`, can move `U` to `(2, 5)` to eat the food.\n- `(2, 5)` has a long life span (until turn 13), so no urgency.\n- After eating `(2, 5)`, the snake would be at `[(2, 5), (2, 4)]` with direction `U`.\n- Then can move `U` to `(2, 6)` or `L` to `(1, 5)` to approach `(1, 6)`.\n\n**Option 2: Move `D` to `(3, 3)`**\n- Next turn (turn 6), from `(3, 3)` with direction `D`, can move `L` to `(2, 3)` or `R` to `(4, 3)`.\n- `(3, 2)` is a wall, so cannot move further down.\n- This path doesn't immediately lead to any food, but could be used to reach `(4, 1)` or `(1, 2)` later.\n\n**Option 3: Move `R` to `(4, 4)`**\n- Next turn (turn 6), from `(4, 4)` with direction `R`, can move `U` to `(4, 5)` (but `(4, 5)` is a wall), `D` to `(4, 3)`, or `R` to `(5, 4)`.\n- Moving `R` to `(5, 4)` sets up to reach `(5, 3)` at turn 7.\n- `(5, 3)` has a shorter life span (until turn 9), so this is more urgent.\n\n### Prioritizing Food with Short Life Span:\n\nFoods `(5, 3)`, `(4, 1)`, and `(1, 6)` disappear after turn 9, so they should be prioritized over `(2, 5)` and `(1, 2)`.\n\n- `(5, 3)`: Can be reached by moving `R` to `(4, 4)` at turn 5, then `R` to `(5, 4)` at turn 6, then `D` to `(5, 3)` at turn 7.\n- `(4, 1)`: Can be reached by moving `D` to `(3, 3)` at turn 5, then `R` to `(4, 3)` at turn 6, then `D` to `(4, 2)` at turn 7, then `D` to `(4, 1)` at turn 8.\n- `(1, 6)`: Can be reached by moving `L` to `(2, 4)` at turn 5, then `L` to `(1, 4)` at turn 6, then `U` to `(1, 5)` at turn 7, then `U` to `(1, 6)` at turn 8.\n\nThe most efficient seems to be moving `R` to `(4, 4)` to reach `(5, 3)` by turn 7, as it's the earliest we can eat one of the short-life foods.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food:\n\nIs there any food adjacent to `(3, 4)` that can be eaten immediately?\n- `(5, 3)`: Not adjacent (distance of 2).\n- `(4, 1)`: Not adjacent.\n- `(1, 6)`: Not adjacent.\n- `(1, 2)`: Not adjacent.\n- `(2, 5)`: Not adjacent.\n\nNo immediate food to eat, so we must plan a path.\n\n### Decision:\n\nGiven the urgency of `(5, 3)`, `(4, 1)`, and `(1, 6)` disappearing after turn 9, and `(5, 3)` being reachable by turn 7, the best immediate move is `R` to `(4, 4)`.\n\n### Verifying Collisions and Safety:\n\n- Moving `R` to `(4, 4)`:\n  - `(4, 4)` is not a wall and not occupied by the snake's body (snake length is 1, so no body).\n  - No risk of collision.\n  - Direction after move will be `R`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n\\boxed{R}",

To eat it, must be at (4, 1) by turn 9. From current position, cannot reach it in time (as analyzed in the guidance).\n- **(1, 6)**: Expires by turn 10.

The sequence would involve moving left initially to get closer to (1, 2).\n\nThus, the immediate action should be **Left (L)** to (4, 3).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{L}",

Current head is at (2, 3), so (1, 2) is adjacent (delta x=-1, delta y=-1). However, the snake can only move orthogonally (U/D/L/R), so (1, 2) is not reachable in one move. Thus, it cannot be eaten this turn and will disappear.\n- **(2, 5)**: Not adjacent to (2, 3). Requires at least two moves to reach.\n- **(1, 1)**: Far away, not immediately reachable.\n- **(2, 6)**: Far away, not immediately reachable.\n\n### Guidance from Previous Plan (Turn 10):\nThe previous plan suggested moving **Left (L)** to (2, 3) on Turn 10 (which is now the current head position), then **Up (U)** to (2, 4) on Turn 11, followed by **Up (U)** to (2, 5) on Turn 12 to eat the food there. This seems like a reasonable plan to reach the closest food at (2, 5).\n\n### Decision for Turn 11:\n- **Move Up (U)**: This aligns with the previous plan to reach (2, 5) by Turn 12. Moving to (2, 4) is safe (no walls or body) and progresses toward the food.\n- **Move Left (L)**: This would take the snake to (1, 3), which doesn't directly help reach any food soon and might limit future options.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate action is to follow the previous plan and move **Up (U)** to (2, 4).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Move Left (L) to \\( (1, 4) \\):**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Positions the snake closer to \\( (1, 1) \\), which has a longer lifespan.\n- **Cons:**\n  - Misses the immediate reward at \\( (2, 5) \\).\n  - \\( (1, 1) \\) can be targeted later after securing \\( (2, 5) \\).\n\n**3. Move Right (R) to \\( (3, 4) \\):**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Moves towards the center, potentially more open space.\n- **Cons:**\n  - No immediate reward.\n  - Less direct path to any food.\n\n### Considering the Previous Plan (from Turn 10)\n\nThe previous plan aimed to:\n1.

Move up to \\( (2, 5) \\) at turn 12 to eat the food.\n\nGiven that the current state matches this plan (snake at \\( (2, 4) \\) at turn 12), continuing with the planned move (U to \\( (2, 5) \\)) is consistent and optimal.\n\n### Potential Future Moves After Eating \\( (2, 5) \\)\n\nAfter eating \\( (2, 5) \\) at turn 12:\n- Snake positions: \\( [(2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3)] \\).\n- Possible moves from \\( (2, 5) \\):\n  - Up (U) to \\( (2, 6) \\): Contains food \\( (2, 6) \\), can eat next.\n  - Left (L) to \\( (1, 5) \\): No food, but can explore towards \\( (1, 1) \\).\n  - Right (R) to \\( (3, 5) \\): Leads to \\( (4, 5) \\) which is a wall, limiting options.\n\nOptimal next move would be U to \\( (2, 6) \\) to eat another food, then plan to navigate towards \\( (1, 1) \\).\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nAfter eating \\( (2, 5) \\):\n- Head at \\( (2, 5) \\), tail at \\( (2, 3) \\).\n- Adjacent to tail: \\( (2, 4) \\) (body segment), not tail.\n- No food under tail, so no danger.\n\nSimilarly, after eating \\( (2, 6) \\):\n- Head at \\( (2, 6) \\), tail at \\( (2, 4) \\).\n- Adjacent to tail: \\( (2, 5) \\) (body segment), no food, so safe.\n\n### Final Decision for Turn 12\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- **Best immediate action:** Move Up (U) to \\( (2, 5) \\) to eat the food.\n- **Consistency with previous plan:** Aligns with the planned sequence.\n- **Future flexibility:** Allows for subsequent moves to \\( (2, 6) \\) and then towards \\( (1, 1) \\).\n\n### Action Sequence (for reference)\n\nContinuing from the previous plan:\n- Turn 10: L to \\( (2, 3) \\).\n- Turn 11: U to \\( (2, 4) \\).\n- Turn 12: U to \\( (2, 5) \\) (eat).\n- Turn 13: U to \\( (2, 6) \\) (eat).\n- Turn 14: L to \\( (1, 6) \\).\n- Turn 15: D to \\( (1, 5) \\).\n\nHowever, since we are at turn 12, the immediate action is:\n\n\\boxed{U}",

The previous plan suggests moving R again to (3,4).\n\n**Possible Moves at Turn 16**:\n- Current direction: R.\n- Cannot move left (opposite direction).\n- Possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Move R to (3,4)**:\n   - New head: (3,4).\n   - Body: (2,4).\n   - Tail: (1,4).\n   - This aligns with the previous plan to approach (3,5).\n\n2. **Move U to (2,5)**:\n   - New head: (2,5).\n   - Body: (2,4).\n   - Tail: (1,4).\n   - This could be a detour from the plan but might be useful for other foods.\n\n3. **Move D to (2,3)**:\n   - New head: (2,3).\n   - Body: (2,4).\n   - Tail: (1,4).\n   - Moves away from current foods.\n\n**Decision**:\nThe previous plan's move R to (3,4) is valid and continues the path toward (3,5). \n\n### Verifying the Plan's Continuation\n\nAfter moving to (3,4) at turn 16:\n- **Turn 17**: Move U to (3,5) to eat the food.\n  - New head: (3,5).\n  - Body: (3,4), (2,4), (1,4).\n  - Snake grows to length 4: [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)].\n\n- **Turn 18**: From (3,5), possible moves:\n  - U: (3,6) → obstacle.\n  - D: (3,4) → body, collision.\n  - L: (2,5).\n  - R: (4,5) → obstacle.\n  - Only L to (2,5) is valid.\n\n- **Turn 19**: From (2,5), move U to (2,6) to eat the food.\n  - New head: (2,6).\n  - Body: (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4).\n  - Snake grows to length 5: [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4)].\n\nThis sequence successfully eats both (3,5) and (2,6) by turn 19.\n\n### Alternative Considerations\n\n- **Food at (1,1)**:\n  - Life span 1, so it disappears after turn 16.\n  - Current head at (2,4), cannot reach (1,1) in one move (distance is 2 steps in x and 3 in y).\n  - Thus, it's impossible to eat (1,1) before it disappears.\n\n- **Food at (6,6)**:\n  - Far away, life span 10, can be considered later if the snake survives.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- After eating (2,6) at turn 19, the snake is at [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4)].\n  - From (2,6), possible moves:\n    - L to (1,6).\n    - D to (2,5) → body, collision.\n    - R to (3,6) → obstacle.\n    - U to (2,7) → wall.\n    - Only L to (1,6) is safe.\n  - This leads to a potential path down the left side, but careful planning is needed to avoid dead ends.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe previous plan is still valid and optimal for the current state. Continuing with the planned move R at turn 16 sets up the snake to eat both (3,5) and (2,6) efficiently.\n\n### Final Action for Turn 16\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Options: U (up), D (down), R (right).\n- **Food**:\n  - (2,6): Life span 4, value +1.\n  - (3,5): Life span 6, value +1 (directly above head).\n  - (6,6): Life span 9, value +1 (far away).\n\n### Immediate Options:\n1. **Move U (up) to (3,5)**:\n   - Eat food at (3,5): +1 score, snake grows to length 4.\n   - Next turn (18), must move L (left) to (2,5) (only safe move).\n   - Turn 19: Can move U to (2,6) to eat food there (life span 4, so must act soon).\n   - **Risk**: After eating (2,6), snake is long and may get stuck (only move L to (1,6) is safe).\n\n2. **Move R (right) to (4,4)**:\n   - No food eaten. Snake moves to [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4)].\n   - Next moves can explore toward (6,6), but (2,6) may expire.\n\n3. **Move D (down) to (3,3)**:\n   - No food eaten. Snake moves to [(3,3), (3,4), (2,4)].\n   - Next moves are limited (cannot go up or down due to body/obstacles).\n\n### Decision:\n- **Best Immediate Action**: Move U to (3,5) to eat the food. This maximizes score and aligns with the Thinking Model's plan to prioritize (2,6) next.\n- **Why?**:\n  - (3,5) is safe to eat now (no collision risks).\n  - (2,6) must be eaten soon (life span 4), and this path allows that.\n  - The alternative (moving R or D) delays eating and risks losing (2,6).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{U}",

Cannot move L (Left) because it's the opposite of the current direction (R).\n- **Food**:\n  - (6,6): Life span 1 (disappears after this turn; unreachable).\n  - (4,2): Life span 4 (can be eaten on turns 25-28).\n  - (5,1): Life span 7 (can be eaten on turns 25-31).\n  - (6,4): Life span 10 (can be eaten on turns 25-34).\n\n### Immediate Moves:\nFrom (3,4), the possible moves are:\n1. **Right (R) to (4,4)**:\n   - (4,4) is empty (no food, no obstacle, not body).\n   - Moves the snake toward the center and closer to food (6,4).\n2. **Up (U) to (3,5)**:\n   - (3,5) is empty.\n   - Moves the snake upward, but the next move options are limited (cannot go U to (3,6) due to obstacle, cannot go D (reverse), so only L or R).\n3. **Down (D) to (3,3)**:\n   - (3,3) is empty.\n   - Moves the snake downward, closer to food (4,2). From (3,3), can move R to (4,3) next, then D to (4,2) to eat the food on Turn 27.\n\n### Evaluation:\n- **Goal**: Maximize score by eating positive food (all food here is +1) while avoiding risks.\n- **Priority**: Food (4,2) has a short life span (disappears after Turn 28), so it should be prioritized over (5,1) and (6,4).\n- **Best Path to (4,2)**:\n  - Turn 25: D to (3,3).\n  - Turn 26: R to (4,3).\n  - Turn 27: D to (4,2) to eat the food.\n- **Alternative Path to (4,2)**:\n  - Turn 25: R to (4,4).\n  - Turn 26: D to (4,3).\n  - Turn 27: D to (4,2) to eat the food.\n  - This is equally valid but slightly less direct.\n\n### Risks:\n- Moving U to (3,5) limits future options and doesn't directly help reach food quickly.\n- Moving R to (4,4) is safe but delays reaching (4,2) by one turn compared to moving D first.\n- Moving D to (3,3) is the most direct path to (4,2) and avoids dead ends.\n\n### Decision:\nThe most efficient and safe immediate action is to move **Down (D)** to (3,3), setting up the path to eat (4,2) on Turn 27.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State (Turn \\( t_0 = 30 \\))\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state at turn 30 based on the provided information:\n\n1. **Grid Layout**:\n   - **Borders**: Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6).\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). These cells are blocked.\n\n2. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: [(5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)] — head at (5,1), tail at (2,4), length 7.\n   - **Head Direction**: D (down). The snake moved down to reach (5,1) from (5,2).\n\n3. **Food**:\n   - (6,4): value=1, life_span=5\n   - (6,1): value=1, life_span=8\n\n4. **Previous Plan from Turn 29**:\n   - The previous thinking model at turn 29 decided to avoid eating the food at (5,1) (which had a life_span of 3 at that time) to prevent trapping the snake in a corner. Instead, it planned to move towards (6,4) by the sequence: U (to (5,3)), R (to (6,3)), U (to (6,4)), L (to (5,4)).\n   - However, at turn 30, the snake is at (5,1), indicating that the snake did move down to (5,1) at turn 29, contrary to the previous plan's suggestion to move up. This suggests that the previous plan was not followed, or there might be a discrepancy in the state description.\n\nGiven that at turn 30 the snake is at (5,1) with direction D, let's proceed from the current state.\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 30\n\nFrom the current head position (5,1) and direction D, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **U (Up)**: (5,2)\n   - Current direction is D, so moving U is a reverse, which is not allowed.\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n2. **D (Down)**: (5,0)\n   - y=0 is a wall.\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n3. **L (Left)**: (4,1)\n   - Check if (4,1) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=4,y=1 is within bounds and not in the internal obstacles list.\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body: The snake's body segments are at (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4). (4,1) is not in this list.\n     - No food at (4,1).\n   - **Valid**.\n\n4. **R (Right)**: (6,1)\n   - Check if (6,1) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=6,y=1 is within bounds and not an internal obstacle.\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body.\n     - Has food: (6,1) with value=1, life_span=8.\n   - **Valid**.\n\nSo, the valid immediate moves are L to (4,1) or R to (6,1).\n\n### Evaluating Move to (6,1) (Right)\n\nIf we move R to (6,1):\n- Eat the food at (6,1): +1 score, snake length increases to 8.\n- New head position: (6,1), direction R.\n- New body: [(6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)].\n\nNext possible moves from (6,1), direction R:\n- Cannot reverse (L is reverse of R, so no L).\n- U to (6,2):\n  - (6,2) is free (no wall, no body, no food).\n- D to (6,0): wall, invalid.\n- R to (7,1): wall, invalid.\nSo, only U to (6,2).\n\nAfter moving U to (6,2), direction U:\n- Cannot reverse (D is reverse, so no D).\n- U to (6,3):\n  - (6,3) is free.\n- L to (5,2):\n  - (5,2) is body segment, collision.\n- R to (7,2): wall, invalid.\nSo, only U to (6,3).\n\nContinuing this path seems to lead the snake towards the top-right corner, which may eventually trap it, similar to the previous plan's concern.\n\n### Evaluating Move to (4,1) (Left)\n\nIf we move L to (4,1):\n- No food at (4,1), so snake length remains 7.\n- New head position: (4,1), direction L.\n- New body: [(4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)] (tail (2,4) moves off).\n\nNext possible moves from (4,1), direction L:\n- Cannot reverse (R is reverse of L, so no R).\n- U to (4,2):\n  - (4,2) is body segment (second segment after head), collision.\n- D to (4,0): wall, invalid.\n- L to (3,1):\n  - (3,1) is an internal obstacle, wall.\n- No valid moves; snake is stuck.\n- **Dead end**.\n\nThis leads to an immediate dead end, which is fatal.\n\n### Re-evaluating Previous Plan\n\nGiven that moving R leads to potential trapping and moving L leads to immediate death, the previous plan's avoidance of eating (5,1) seems flawed because now the snake is at (5,1) after presumably eating it at turn 29 (since the snake's length is 7, and at turn 29 it was 6 before eating (5,1)).\n\nPerhaps the correct interpretation is that at turn 29, the snake was at (5,2) with direction R, and the plan was to move U to (5,3), but instead, the snake moved D to (5,1), eating the food there, leading to the current state at turn 30.\n\nGiven that, and seeing that moving L is fatal, the only viable immediate move is R to (6,1), despite the long-term trapping risk.\n\n### Checking for Alternative Interpretations\n\nIs there another way to interpret the current state where the snake didn't eat (5,1)? \n\nIf at turn 29 the snake was at (5,2) and did not eat (5,1), then moving D would place the head at (5,1) without eating, meaning the food is under the head, which can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it again. But the current state shows the snake's head at (5,1) with length 7, implying it did grow by eating.\n\nThus, the snake must have eaten (5,1) at turn 29, leading to the current state at turn 30.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the current state at turn 30:\n- The only non-fatal immediate move is R to (6,1), eating the food there.\n- This leads to a path that may eventually trap the snake, but there's no better immediate alternative.\n- Moving L is fatal, and U/D are invalid.\n\nThus, the immediate action at turn 30 should be to move R to (6,1).\n\nHowever, the previous plan suggested avoiding (5,1) to prevent trapping, but since the snake is already at (5,1), the best now is to proceed to (6,1).\n\nBut wait—the food at (5,1) was supposed to disappear after turn 31 (since at turn 29 its life_span was 3: turns 29,30,31). At turn 30, it's still present (life_span decreased to 2 at turn 30, so present at turns 30,31, disappears after).\n\nBut the snake is already at (5,1), so it must have eaten it at turn 29, meaning it's no longer present at turn 30. \n\nWait, no—the food at (5,1) was present at turn 29 with life_span 3, so it's present at turns 29,30,31. If the snake ate it at turn 29, it's no longer present at turn 30. But the current state at turn 30 lists food at (6,4) and (6,1), not (5,1), so it's already gone.\n\nThus, the snake is at (5,1) after having eaten the food there at turn 29, and now at turn 30, the only moves are L to (4,1) (dead end) or R to (6,1) (eat food, potential trap).\n\nGiven that, the only viable move is R to (6,1).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAt turn 30, the immediate action is to move right to (6,1) to eat the food there, as moving left leads to an immediate\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",
