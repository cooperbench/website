(3, 5): value = 1, life_span = 9\n  2. (6, 6): value = 1, life_span = 9\n  3. (6, 4): value = 1, life_span = 10\n\n### Previous Thinking Model's Plan (Turn \\( t_1 = 0 \\))\n\nAt Turn 0, the thinking model planned the following sequence to maximize score by eating all three foods:\n\n1. **Turn 0**: Move L to (2,3) → Eat (2,3)\n2. **Turn 1**: Move U to (2,4)\n3. **Turn 2**: Move U to (2,5)\n4. **Turn 3**: Move R to (3,5) → Eat (3,5)\n5. **Turn 4**: Move R to (4,5)\n6. **Turn 5**: Move R to (5,5)\n7. **Turn 6**: Move U to (5,6)\n8. **Turn 7**: Move R to (6,6) → Eat (6,6)\n\nHowever, the current state is at Turn 1, and the snake has already moved to (2,3) as per the plan. Now, we need to decide the next move based on the current state and the previous plan.\n\n### Current Snake Position and Possible Moves\n\n- **Current Head Position**: (2,3)\n- **Current Direction**: Left (L)\n- **Possible Moves** (cannot reverse direction, so cannot move Right (R)):\n  - Up (U): (2,4)\n  - Down (D): (2,2)\n  - Left (L): (1,3)\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\n1. **Move Left (L) to (1,3)**:\n   - Check if (1,3) is valid:\n     - Not a wall (x=1 is within bounds).\n     - Not part of the snake's body (only body segment is at (3,3)).\n   - No food at (1,3), so no growth.\n   - After move: Snake becomes [(1,3), (2,3)].\n   - Next moves would need to navigate towards remaining foods, but this seems less optimal as it moves away from (3,5) and (6,6).\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (2,4)**:\n   - Check if (2,4) is valid:\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not part of the snake's body.\n   - No food at (2,4), so no growth.\n   - After move: Snake becomes [(2,4), (2,3)].\n   - This aligns with the previous plan's Turn 1 action.\n   - Next step would be Turn 2: Move U to (2,5), then proceed towards (3,5).\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (2,2)**:\n   - Check if (2,2) is valid:\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not part of the snake's body.\n   - No food at (2,2), so no growth.\n   - After move: Snake becomes [(2,2), (2,3)].\n   - This deviates from the plan and moves away from the foods at (3,5) and (6,6).\n\n### Adhering to the Previous Plan\n\nThe previous plan was designed to efficiently eat all three foods within their life spans:\n\n- (2,3): Eaten at Turn 0.\n- (3,5): Planned to eat at Turn 3.\n- (6,6): Planned to eat at Turn 7.\n\nGiven that we're at Turn 1, and the snake is at [(2,3), (3,3)], the next move according to the plan is **Up (U) to (2,4)**. This sets up the path to reach (3,5) by Turn 3.\n\n### Verifying Safety and Optimality\n\n- **Collision Check**: Moving to (2,4) doesn't collide with the body or walls.\n- **Food Accessibility**: After moving to (2,4), the next move is to (2,5), then to (3,5) to eat the food there.\n- **Life Span**: \n  - (3,5): life_span = 9 at Turn 0 → At Turn 3, life_span = 6, so still present.\n  - (6,6): life_span = 9 at Turn 0 → At Turn 7, life_span = 2, so still present.\n  - (6,4): life_span = 10 at Turn 0 → Not in the current plan, but could be considered if time permits.\n\n### Considering Alternative Foods\n\nThe food at (6,4) is not in the original plan. Its life_span is 10, so it will disappear after Turn 10. \n\n- To eat (6,4), we'd need to adjust the path, but it may not be feasible without missing (3,5) or (6,6).\n- Given that all foods have the same value (+1), sticking to the original plan that ensures eating two foods is reasonable, especially since (6,4) is not directly on the path.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: When eating (3,5) at Turn 3:\n  - Before move: head at (2,5), tail at (2,4) → adjacent.\n  - Tail cell (2,4) does not have food, so no danger.\n- **Body Collision**: The path is designed to avoid the snake's body.\n- **Wall/Obstacle Collision**: The path avoids walls and the obstacle at (3,6).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most optimal immediate action at Turn 1 is to follow the previous plan and move **Up (U)** to (2,4). This sets the snake on a path to safely and efficiently consume the remaining positive foods at (3,5) and (6,6) within their life spans.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Internal obstacle at (3,6).\n- **Possible Moves**: Since the snake is facing right (R), it cannot move left (L) due to the no-instant-reverse rule. Valid moves: Up (U), Down (D), Right (R).\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Food at (6,6)**:\n   - Life span 2: Can only be eaten on Turns 8 or 9.\n   - From (4,4), it is impossible to reach (6,6) by Turn 9 (requires at least 2 moves to get adjacent, but cannot reach it directly).\n   - Conclusion: Ignore (6,6) as it cannot be eaten before it disappears.\n\n2. **Food at (6,4)**:\n   - Life span 3: Can be eaten on Turns 8, 9, or 10.\n   - Can be reached in 2 moves: R to (5,4) on Turn 8, then R to (6,4) on Turn 9 to eat it.\n   - After eating, the snake will be at (6,4) with body segments behind it, limiting next moves to U or D (cannot move L into body or R into wall).\n\n3. **Other Food**:\n   - (3,2) and (5,1) have longer life spans and can be targeted later.\n\n4. **Risks**:\n   - After eating (6,4), the snake is at the edge (x=6), which may limit future movement options.\n   - No immediate collision risks with the tail or walls in the current state.\n\n### Possible Actions at Turn 8:\n1. **Move R to (5,4)**:\n   - Sets up to eat (6,4) on Turn 9.\n   - After eating, must move U or D on Turn 10, which may lead to a less flexible position.\n   - Gains +1 score immediately on Turn 9.\n\n2. **Move U to (4,5)**:\n   - Moves away from the edge, opening more options for future moves.\n   - (6,4) can still be eaten later (life span 3).\n   - Allows exploration towards other food (e.g., (3,2) or (5,1)).\n\n3. **Move D to (4,3)**:\n   - Similar to moving U, but heads downward.\n   - May be better for reaching (3,2) or (5,1).\n\n### Decision:\n- The most urgent food is (6,4) (life span 3), but it can still be eaten on Turn 9 or 10.\n- Moving R now to (5,4) commits to eating (6,4) on Turn 9, which may trap the snake at the edge.\n- Moving U or D provides more flexibility and avoids potential dead ends.

Safe.\n   - **L (to (4,3))**: Not a wall, not an obstacle, not body. Safe.\n   - **R (to (6,3))**: Not a wall, not an obstacle, not body. Safe.\n\n### Objective:\nMaximize score by eating positive food, prioritizing food that will expire soonest.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **(3,2)** expires soonest (by turn 14). To eat it by turn 14:\n   - **Path 1**: \n     - Turn 12: L to (4,3).\n     - Turn 13: D to (4,2).\n     - Turn 14: L to (3,2) to eat.\n   - **Path 2**: \n     - Turn 12: L to (4,3).\n     - Turn 13: L to (3,3).\n     - Turn 14: D to (3,2) to eat.\n   \n   Both paths reach (3,2) by turn 14. Path 1 (via (4,2)) is slightly better as it positions the snake closer to (5,1) for future moves.\n\n2. **(5,1)** can be eaten later (by turn 16). If we go for (3,2) first, we can still reach (5,1) in time:\n   - After eating (3,2) at turn 14, snake is at (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3).\n   - Possible moves to (5,1):\n     - Turn 15: D to (3,1).\n     - Turn 16: R to (4,1).\n     - Turn 17: R to (5,1) to eat (but (5,1) expires after turn 16, so too late).\n     - Alternatively, from (3,2), turn 15: L to (2,2), but this doesn't help reach (5,1) in time.\n\n   However, reaching (5,1) by turn 16 is tight and may not be feasible after eating (3,2). \n\n3. **(2,6)** has plenty of time (until turn 19), so it's lower priority.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the urgency to eat (3,2) by turn 14 and the difficulty in also reaching (5,1) in time, the best immediate action is to start moving towards (3,2):\n\n- **Turn 12**: Move Left (L) to (4,3). This starts the path towards (3,2) and keeps options open for future moves.\n\n### Verification:\n- After L to (4,3):\n  - New positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4)].\n  - Next turn (13): Can move D to (4,2) or L to (3,3) to proceed towards (3,2).\n\nThis is the most reliable way to secure the soon-to-expire food at (3,2).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{L}",

This was executed successfully, and the snake grew to length 5. The current state reflects this.\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 16:\nFrom (5, 1) with direction R, the snake cannot reverse to L. Possible moves:\n1. **U (Up)**: (5, 2)  \n   - Check: Not a wall or body. Safe.\n2. **R (Right)**: (6, 1)  \n   - Check: Not a wall or body.

Invalid.\n\nThus, valid moves are **U** or **R**.\n\n### Decision:\nThe previous plan suggested moving **U** to (5, 2) at Turn 16 to start moving upward toward the other food at (2, 6). This aligns with the goal of maximizing score by eventually reaching the food at (2, 6), even though it cannot be eaten by Turn 19 due to distance constraints.

Moving Right (R) is invalid (opposite direction and leads to collision).\n3. **Plan**: The plan from Turn 21 was to move Left (L) to (4,4) at Turn 21, then Left (L) to (3,4) at Turn 22, followed by Down (D) to (3,3), (3,2), and finally (3,1) to eat the food by Turn 25.

(2,4) is not in this list.\n     - No food at (2,4): From the food list, no food is at (2,4).\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Turn Left (L)**: (2, 3) → (1, 3)\n   - Check (1,3):\n     - Not a wall: Yes\n     - Not an obstacle: Yes\n     - Not part of the body: Yes\n     - Food at (1,3): Yes, with value +1, life_span 8.\n   - Valid move, and it leads to eating food.\n\n3. **Turn Right (R)**: (2, 3) → (3, 3)\n   - Check (3,3):\n     - Not a wall: Yes\n     - Not an obstacle: Yes\n     - Not part of the body: Yes\n     - No food at (3,3): From the food list, no.\n   - Valid move.\n\n**Cannot move Down (D)**: Opposite to current direction \"U\", which is not allowed.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move based on the game's rules and the thinking model's previous plan.\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (2,4)\n\n- **Pros**:\n  - Keeps the snake moving in the current direction, which might be part of a longer path.\n  - Doesn't immediately eat food, which could be useful if we're trying to expose food under the tail (though currently, no food is under the tail).\n  \n- **Cons**:\n  - Doesn't gain any immediate score.\n  - Moves away from available food at (1,3) and (5,4).\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (1,3) to Eat Food\n\n- **Pros**:\n  - Immediate score gain by eating the food at (1,3).\n  - The food has a long life_span (8), but eating it now secures the point.\n  \n- **Cons**:\n  - Moves the snake towards the edge, which might limit future movement options.\n  - Need to ensure that after eating, the snake can safely move without getting trapped.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (3,3)\n\n- **Pros**:\n  - Moves towards the center, potentially opening up more future movement options.\n  \n- **Cons**:\n  - No immediate score gain.\n  - Moves away from available food.\n\n### Considering the Previous Thinking Model's Plan\n\nFrom the previous thinking model at Turn 25, the plan was to:\n\n1. Move Down (D) to eat (3,1) at Turn 25.\n2. Then move Right (R) to (4,1), (5,1), and (6,1) to eat the food there by Turn 28.\n3. Then move Up (U) and Left (L) to position for future food.\n\nHowever, at Turn 27, the snake is at a different position, and the available food is different. The previous plan was focused on eating (3,1) and (6,1), but now:\n\n- (3,1) is not in the current food list, so it might have been eaten or expired.\n- (6,1) is still present with life_span 3, meaning it will disappear after Turn 29 (since at Turn 27, life_span is 3; after Turn 27: 2, after Turn 28: 1, after Turn 29: 0 and disappears).\n\nGiven this, the immediate food options are:\n\n- (6,1): Need to reach by Turn 29 to eat.\n- (5,4): Life_span 5, so available until Turn 31.\n- (1,3): Life_span 8, so available until Turn 34.\n\n### Deciding the Immediate Move at Turn 27\n\nGiven the current position at (2,3), moving Left to (1,3) allows eating the food there immediately. However, let's consider the implications:\n\n1. **Eating (1,3) at Turn 27**:\n   - Snake grows by 1 segment.\n   - New head at (1,3), body extends to include old head (2,3), then (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), and the tail stays at (4,3) (since eating adds a new segment where the tail was).\n   - From (1,3), possible next moves would be Up (1,4), Down (1,2), or Right (2,3) (but (2,3) is now body, so can't).\n   - Moving Up or Down from (1,3) keeps the snake near the edge, which might be risky.\n\n2. **Alternative: Move Right to (3,3)**:\n   - No food eaten, so tail moves.\n   - New head at (3,3), body: (2,3) moves to (2,2), (3,2) moves to (2,3), (4,2) moves to (3,2), (4,3) moves to (4,2), tail moves from (4,3) to (4,2), and (4,3) is vacated.\n   - From (3,3), can move towards (5,4) or (6,1) in future turns.\n\n3. **Move Up to (2,4)**:\n   - No food eaten.\n   - New head at (2,4), body: (2,3) moves to (2,2), etc., tail moves from (4,3) to (4,2), vacating (4,3).\n   - From (2,4), can move towards other areas.\n\nGiven that (6,1) is expiring soon (by Turn 29), and (1,3) has a longer life, it might be better to prioritize eating (6,1) first. To reach (6,1) from (2,3):\n\n- Need to move rightwards: (2,3) → (3,3) → (4,3) → (5,3) → (6,3) → (6,2) → (6,1).\nBut this is too long; (6,1) will expire by Turn 29, so we can't reach it in time from (2,3) via this path.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3), moving Left to (1,3) eats food, but then reaching (6,1) is even harder.\n\nGiven that, the most immediate gain is to eat (1,3) at Turn 27, then plan subsequent moves carefully to avoid getting trapped.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nBefore deciding to eat (1,3), check if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail has positive food:\n\n- Current head at (2,3), tail at (4,3).\n- Distance: |2-4| + |3-3| = 2, not adjacent (adjacent means distance 1).\n- So no tail reward danger in eating (1,3).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the options:\n\n- **Move Left (L) to (1,3)**: Immediate +1 score, but may limit future movements.\n- **Move Right (R) to (3,3)**: No score, but more flexibility to reach other foods.\n- **Move Up (U) to (2,4)**: No score, moves towards center.\n\nGiven that (6,1) is expiring soon and we can't reach it in time from here, and (1,3) is safe to eat now without tail danger, the best immediate action is to eat (1,3) to secure the point.\n\n### Action Sequence Starting at Turn 27\n\nBased on the above, the immediate action at Turn 27 is to move Left to eat (1,3):\n\n\\boxed{L}",

(3,5) is not in this list.\n     - Safe to move Up.\n   - **Down (D)**: Move to (3,3).\n     - Check if (3,3) is safe:\n       - Not a wall: y=3 is within bounds.\n       - Not an obstacle.\n       - Not occupied by the snake's body: (3,3) is not in the current positions.\n     - Safe to move Down.\n   - **Right (R)**: Move to (4,4).\n     - Check if (4,4) is safe:\n       - Not a wall.\n       - Not an obstacle.\n       - Occupied by food at (4,4), but not by the snake's body.\n     - Safe to move Right, and it would involve eating the food at (4,4).\n\n3. **Left (L)**: Not possible due to instant reverse rule (current direction is R).\n\n### Considering the Previous Plan\n\nThe previous plan from turn 30 suggested:\n- Turn 30: R to (3,4).\n- Turn 31: R to (4,4).\n- Turn 32: R to (5,4) to eat the food there.\n\nHowever, at turn 31, we notice there's also food at (4,4) with a longer life span (10 turns), meaning it's not urgent. The food at (5,4) is more time-sensitive (life span = 2, so must be eaten by turn 32).\n\n### Deciding the Immediate Action\n\nGiven the options:\n\n1. **Move Right (R) to (4,4)**:\n   - Pros:\n     - Follows the previous plan to eventually reach (5,4) by turn 32.\n     - Eats the food at (4,4), increasing score and length.\n   - Cons:\n     - The food at (4,4) isn't urgent; we might want to prioritize the more time-sensitive food at (5,4).\n     - After eating at (4,4), the snake grows, which might complicate reaching (5,4) next turn.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (3,5)**:\n   - Pros:\n     - Keeps the path open to reach (5,4) next turn by moving Right to (4,5), then to (5,5), then to (5,4).\n     - Doesn't immediately grow the snake, making movement more flexible.\n   - Cons:\n     - Takes a longer path to (5,4), might not reach it in time (needs to be eaten by turn 32).\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (3,3)**:\n   - Pros:\n     - Moves away from the body, keeping options open.\n   - Cons:\n     - Moves away from both foods, not optimal for scoring.\n\nGiven that the food at (5,4) must be eaten by turn 32 (next turn), the most straightforward path is to continue Right to (4,4) this turn, then to (5,4) next turn to eat it. Even though we eat (4,4) now, the growth won't prevent us from reaching (5,4) next turn because the tail will have moved, and the path remains clear.\n\n### Verifying Safety After Eating at (4,4)\n\nIf we move to (4,4) at turn 31:\n- Snake grows by 1, new positions: head at (4,4), then (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2).\n- At turn 32, head at (4,4), can move Right to (5,4):\n  - (5,4) is not occupied by the snake's body (current body: (3,4) to (2,2)).\n  - Eating at (5,4) is safe; no collision with the tail (tail is at (2,2)).\n\n### Alternative Consideration: Avoiding Eating at (4,4)\n\nIf we choose not to eat at (4,4) this turn and instead move Up or Down to position for (5,4):\n- Moving Up to (3,5):\n  - Next turn (32), from (3,5), possible moves:\n    - Right to (4,5), then to (5,5), then to (5,4) — but this takes until turn 34 to reach (5,4), which is too late (food disappears after turn 32).\n    - Down to (3,4), but that's back to the body.\n  - Not feasible to reach (5,4) in time.\n\n- Moving Down to (3,3):\n  - Moves away from both foods; not optimal.\n\nThus, the only viable path to eat (5,4) in time is to move Right to (4,4) now, then Right to (5,4) next turn.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the urgency to eat the food at (5,4) before it disappears and the safe path to do so by moving Right consecutively, the immediate action at turn 31 should be to move Right (R) to (4,4). This aligns with the previous plan and ensures we can consume the time-sensitive food next turn.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

The food at (1, 6) is closer (Manhattan distance = |2-1| + |3-6| = 4) but may lead to trapping the snake. The food at (6, 2) is farther (distance = |2-6| + |3-2| = 5) but may offer safer paths.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Move D (Down) to (2, 2)**:\n   - Moves away from both foods. May be safe but misses scoring opportunities.\n   - Not optimal for maximizing score.\n\n2. **Move L (Left) to (1, 3)**:\n   - Moves toward (1, 6).

The food at (6, 2) has a longer life span (10 turns), so there is time to reach it safely.\n\n### Decision:\n- **Move R (Right) to (3, 3)** is the safest and most strategic choice.

The tail is at (5, 6).\n\n**Head Direction**:  \nThe snake's head is currently moving **Up (U)**. This means the last move was from (6, 2) to (6, 3).\n\n**Food**:  \nThere is one food item at (5, 3) with a value of +1 and a life span of 10. This food will disappear after turn 58 (since current turn is 49 + 10 - 1 = 58).\n\n**Walls**:  \n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 6).\n\n### Possible Moves from (6, 3) at Turn 49\n\nGiven the head is at (6, 3) and the direction is U, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (6, 4)\n   - Check if (6, 4) is free:\n     - Not in snake positions: Yes.\n     - Not a wall: Yes (y=4 is within bounds).\n   - Safe to move.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (6, 2)\n   - Opposite direction (from U to D), which is not allowed (no instant reverse).\n   - Also, (6, 2) is occupied by the snake's body (second segment), so collision.\n\n3. **Left (L)**: (5, 3)\n   - Check if (5, 3) is free:\n     - Not in snake positions: Yes.\n     - Not a wall: Yes.\n   - Safe to move.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: (7, 3)\n   - x=7 is a border wall, so collision.\n\nThus, the possible safe moves are **U** and **L**.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\n#### Option 1: Move Up (U) to (6, 4)\n- New head position: (6, 4).\n- Direction becomes U.\n- No food at (6, 4), so no eating.\n- Snake's tail moves away from (5, 6) to (4, 6).\n\n**Next Moves**:\n- From (6, 4), possible moves at turn 50:\n  - U to (6, 5): Free.\n  - D to (6, 3): Body segment (second segment), collision.\n  - L to (5, 4): Free.\n  - R to (7, 4): Wall.\n  - Cannot move D (opposite direction).\n  - So, U or L.\n\n#### Option 2: Move Left (L) to (5, 3)\n- New head position: (5, 3).\n- Direction becomes L.\n- Food at (5, 3), so eat it:\n  - Score +1.\n  - Length increases by 1 (new tail remains at (5, 6)).\n\n**Next Moves**:\n- From (5, 3), possible moves at turn 50:\n  - U to (5, 4): Free.\n  - D to (5, 2): Body segment (third segment), collision.\n  - L to (4, 3): Body segment (sixth segment), collision.\n  - R to (6, 3): Body segment (second segment), collision.\n  - Cannot move R (opposite direction).\n  - Only possible move: U to (5, 4).\n\n### Decision\n\nAt turn 49, moving **Left (L)** to (5, 3) allows the snake to eat the positive food, increasing the score by +1. After eating, the only safe move is Up (U) to (5, 4), which keeps the snake safe and allows for further maneuvering.\n\nMoving Up (U) to (6, 4) avoids eating the food immediately, but the food is safe to eat now, and delaying might risk missing it later or getting into a tight spot. \n\nGiven the guidance from the previous thinking model (which prioritized eating the food at (6, 3) at turn 48), it's consistent to eat the food at (5, 3) now at turn 49.\n\n### Action Sequence\n\n- **Turn 49**: L (to eat the food at (5, 3)).\n- **Turn 50**: U (only safe move after eating).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and there's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n- **Snake**:\n  - Positions: [(6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]\n    - Head at (6,4), moving Right (R).\n    - Tail at (4,5).\n- **Food**:\n  - Only one food at (1,5) with value +1 and life span 10 (will disappear after Turn 61).\n\n### Possible Actions at Turn 52\n\nThe snake is currently moving Right (R), so the possible immediate moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (6,5)\n2. **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (6,3)\n3. **Right (R)**: (x+1, y) → (7,4)\n   - But x=7 is a wall, so this is invalid.\n4. **Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (5,4)\n   - This is the opposite of the current direction (R), so it's not allowed (\"no instant reverse\").\n\nNow, let's evaluate the valid moves:\n\n- **Move U to (6,5)**:\n  - Check if (6,5) is occupied by the snake or is a wall:\n    - Snake positions: (6,5) is not in the list.\n    - Walls: (6,5) is within the playable area and not an obstacle.\n  - So, this move is safe.\n\n- **Move D to (6,3)**:\n  - Check if (6,3) is occupied:\n    - (6,3) is the 4th segment of the snake (not the tail).\n    - Moving into a body segment (other than the tail) causes a collision.\n  - So, this move is deadly.\n\nThus, the only safe move is **U to (6,5)**.\n\n### Verifying the Guidance from the Thinking Model\n\nThe Thinking Model's analysis aligns with this conclusion:\n\n- It correctly identifies that moving Right is invalid (wall at (7,4)).\n- Moving Down to (6,3) would collide with the body.\n- Moving Left is not allowed due to the \"no instant reverse\" rule.\n- Therefore, the only possible move is Up to (6,5), which is safe.\n\n### Potential Future Moves\n\nWhile the immediate action is clear, the Thinking Model also plans ahead to reach the food at (1,5). Here's the proposed sequence:\n\n1. **Turn 52**: Move U to (6,5).\n   - New head position: (6,5), direction U.\n   - Snake body updates: tail (4,5) is removed, new tail is (3,5).\n\n2. **Turn 53**: From (6,5), direction U, possible moves:\n   - U to (6,6): Free.\n   - L to (5,5): Free.\n   - R to (7,5): Wall.\n   - D: Opposite to U, not allowed.\n   - Optimal: Move L to (5,5) towards food.\n\n3. **Turn 54**: From (5,5), direction L, possible moves:\n   - L to (4,5): Free.\n   - U to (5,6): Free.\n   - D to (5,4): Body segment (5,4), collision.\n   - Optimal: Move L to (4,5).\n\n4. **Turn 55**: From (4,5), direction L, possible moves:\n   - L to (3,5): Free.\n   - U to (4,6): Free.\n   - D to (4,4): Free.\n   - Optimal: Move L to (3,5).\n\n5. **Turn 56**: From (3,5), direction L, possible moves:\n   - L to (2,5): Free.\n   - D to (3,4): Free.\n   - U to (3,6): Obstacle.\n   - Optimal: Move L to (2,5).\n\n6. **Turn 57**: From (2,5), direction L, possible move:\n   - L to (1,5): Eat food (+1 score, length increases by 1).\n\nThis sequence safely navigates the snake towards the food without collisions.\n\n### Final Decision for Turn 52\n\nGiven the current state and the constraints, the only safe and valid move is:\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and there's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n  \n- **Snake Positions**: \n  - Head: (6,5)\n  - Body: [(6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5)]\n  - Tail: (3,5)\n  \n- **Snake Head Direction**: U (Up, since the previous move was from (6,4) to (6,5))\n  \n- **Food**: \n  - (1,5): Value = +1, Life Span = 9 (since it was 10 at Turn 52, and now at Turn 53 it's 9)\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 53\n\nGiven the snake's current direction is Up (U), the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (6,5) → (6,6)\n   - Check (6,6): \n     - Not a wall (walls are at y=7).\n     - Not an internal obstacle (only (3,6) is an obstacle).\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body.\n     - **Valid move**.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (6,5) → (6,4)\n   - Check (6,4):\n     - Occupied by the snake's body (second segment).\n     - Only moving into the tail is safe, but (6,4) is not the tail.\n     - **Invalid move (collision with body)**.\n\n3. **Left (L)**: (6,5) → (5,5)\n   - Check (5,5):\n     - Not a wall or obstacle.\n     - Not in the snake's current positions.\n     - **Valid move**.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: (6,5) → (7,5)\n   - Check (7,5):\n     - x=7 is a wall.\n     - **Invalid move (wall collision)**.\n\nAdditionally, since the current direction is U, moving Down (D) is the opposite direction, which is not allowed (\"no instant reverse\"). So, even if (6,4) wasn't occupied, D would be invalid.\n\nThus, the valid moves are **U and L**.\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves\n\n**Option 1: Move Up (U) to (6,6)**\n\n- New head position: (6,6)\n- New direction: U\n- Next possible moves from (6,6):\n  - U: (6,7) → wall (invalid)\n  - D: Opposite direction (invalid)\n  - L: (5,6) \n    - Check (5,6): \n      - Not wall or obstacle.\n      - Not in snake's body (after moving to (6,6), the tail moves away from (3,5) to (3,4)).\n      - Valid.\n  - R: (7,6) → wall (invalid)\n  \nSo, from (6,6), the only valid move would be L to (5,6). This path seems to lead away from the food at (1,5), making it harder to reach the food within its remaining lifespan (9 turns).\n\n**Option 2: Move Left (L) to (5,5)**\n\n- New head position: (5,5)\n- New direction: L\n- Next possible moves from (5,5):\n  - L: (4,5)\n    - Check (4,5):\n      - Currently, the tail is at (3,5), so (4,5) is not occupied (after moving, the tail moves to (3,4)).\n      - Valid.\n  - U: (5,6)\n    - Valid.\n  - D: (5,4)\n    - Occupied by the snake's body (third segment after move).\n    - Invalid.\n  - R: Opposite direction (invalid).\n  \nMoving L to (4,5) is towards the food at (1,5), which is beneficial for scoring.\n\n### Path to the Food\n\nIf we choose to move L at Turn 53, the sequence to reach the food could be:\n\n- Turn 53: L to (5,5)\n- Turn 54: L to (4,5)\n- Turn 55: L to (3,5)\n  - (3,5) is the current tail at Turn 53, but after moves, it will have moved.\n- Turn 56: L to (2,5)\n- Turn 57: L to (1,5) → eat food.\n\nThis sequence takes 5 turns (from Turn 53 to Turn 57), and the food's remaining lifespan is 9 at Turn 53, so it will be there until Turn 62 (53 + 9 - 1 = 61, present at 61, gone at 62). Thus, eating by Turn 57 is safe.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nWhen eating at (1,5), check if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail has positive food:\n\n- Head at (1,5), tail at (assuming after moves) is not adjacent (tail would be at (2,3) after some moves, not adjacent to (1,5)).\n- The food is at (1,5), not under the tail.\n  \nNo Tail Reward Danger here.\n\n### Alternative Considerations\n\nIf we choose to go Up at Turn 53 to (6,6), the path to the food is longer and may not reach it in time. Also, the grid is small, and the snake is long (length 14), so maneuvering might become tricky, risking collisions.\n\nMoving Left seems more direct and safer for reaching the food promptly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAt Turn 53, the best immediate action is to move **Left (L)** to (5,5), initiating a path towards the positive food at (1,5) while avoiding collisions and adhering to movement constraints.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Possible moves:\n1. **Left (L) to (2,5)**:\n   - (2,5) is not occupied by the body or walls.\n   - Next step could be L to (1,5) to eat the food (+1 score).\n   - After eating, the snake grows, and the tail remains at (2,3).\n   - From (1,5), possible moves are Up (U) to (1,6) or Down (D) to (1,4) (since R to (2,5) is body and L is wall).\n2. **Down (D) to (3,4)**:\n   - (3,4) is not occupied by the body or walls.\n   - From (3,4), possible moves are Left (L) to (2,4) or Right (R) to (4,4) (since U is opposite direction and D to (3,3) is body).\n   - This avoids the immediate food but may allow more flexibility later.\n\n### Risks and Considerations:\n- **Food at (1,5)**:\n  - Eating it gives +1 score and grows the snake.\n  - The snake is already long (14 segments), and the grid is small (6x6 with obstacles), so growing further may limit future movement.\n  - The food disappears after turn 61, so we have time to reach it later if needed.\n- **Food at (1,1)**:\n  - Further away but has a longer life span (until turn 64).\n  - May be safer to target this first to avoid trapping ourselves.\n- **Space Constraints**:\n  - The snake is coiled tightly, so moving down to (3,4) may open up more space to maneuver.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the risks of growing the snake further and the tight space, it is safer to **avoid eating the food at (1,5) immediately** and instead **move Down (D) to (3,4)**.

Distance to (1, 1) is |dx|=1, |dy|=4 (total 5 moves needed), but only 2 turns left (63, 64).
