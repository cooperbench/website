The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway at a certain turn, I don't collide with any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. All cars seem to be moving right, based on the directions given. Let me list them out:\n\n- Freeway 1: head=48, tail=37, direction=right, speed=12\n\n- Freeway 2: head=-48, tail=-59, direction=right, speed=6\n\n- Freeway 3: same as 2: head=-48, tail=-59, right, speed=6\n\n- Freeway 4: same, head=-48, tail=-59, right, speed=6\n\n- Freeway 5: same, head=-48, tail=-59, right, speed=6\n\n- Freeway 6: head=-48, tail=-83, right, speed=36\n\n- Freeway 7: head=-48, tail=-95, right, speed=48\n\n- Freeway 8: same as 7: head=-48, tail=-95, right, speed=48\n\nFor right-moving cars, the span is [tail, head], and it moves right with speed s. The update is: at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] for right-moving cars.\n\nt1 is given as 0, so T is the turn number since t1=0.\n\nSo for each car, at turn T, the span is:\n\nLet me denote the initial span at t1=0.\n\nFor freeway 1: initial head h=48, tail τ=37, but since it's right-moving, the span is from τ to h, so [37,48] at T=0? No.\n\nThe car state says \"head h, tail τ, direction d\". For right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and moves to [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly for left, but all are right here.\n\nSo for freeway 1: at t1=0, span is [τ, h] = [37,48], direction right, speed 12.\n\nThen at turn T, span is [37 + 12T, 48 + 12T]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: head=-48, tail=-59, so span at T=0 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48], speed 6, so at T, [-59 + 6T, -48 + 6T]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2, [-59 + 6T, -48 + 6T]\n\nFreeway 4: same\n\nFreeway 5: same\n\nFreeway 6: head=-48, tail=-83, so span at T=0: [-83, -48], speed 36, at T: [-83 + 36T, -48 + 36T]\n\nFreeway 7: head=-48, tail=-95, span at T=0: [-95, -48], speed 48, at T: [-95 + 48T, -48 + 48T]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, [-95 + 48T, -48 + 48T]\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y at turn T, and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe player starts at (0,0) at turn 0. y=0 is not a freeway, so no cars there. Freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nThe player needs to reach y=9, which is also not a freeway, so no cars there either. So we only worry about freeways 1 to 8 when moving through them.\n\nThe player position: at each turn, after action, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on action U, D, S.\n\nActions are taken at each turn, and the position updates.\n\nThe sequence is for turns starting from t1=0.\n\nWe need to find actions a_0, a_1, ..., up to a_{H-1} such that at turn H-1, y_{H-1} =9? Let's see the indices.\n\nTurn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so at time t1 + t, action a_{t1+t}.\n\nt1=0, so actions a_0, a_1, ..., a_{H-1}, and after H actions, at time t=H, position is y_H.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at turn t, action a_t determines Δy_t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position is given for turn t1, which is (0, y_{t1}) = (0,0) at turn 0.\n\nSo at turn 0, position is (0,0).\n\nAfter action a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0.\n\nThen at turn 1, position is (0, y_1), and so on.\n\nWe want to reach (0,9), so y_T =9 for some T.\n\nThe minimal H such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9? Let's parse.\n\nIt says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nt1 + H -1 is the turn when position is 9.\n\nSince actions are from t=0 to H-1, that means after H actions, at turn H, position is y_H.\n\nBut it says y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet t1=0 for simplicity.\n\nSo actions a_0 to a_{H-1}, and at turn (0 + H -1) = H-1, position is 9.\n\nTurn indices: at turn 0, position y_0 =0.\n\nAfter action a_0, at turn 1, position y_1.\n\nGenerally, at turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, position at turn t+1 is y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at turn 0, y_0=0.\n\nWe want for some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=0 to t=H-1, meaning a_0, a_1, ..., a_{H-1}, and after these actions, at turn H, position y_H.\n\nBut the condition is y_{t1 + H -1} =9, with t1=0, so y_{H-1} =9.\n\nSo at turn H-1, position is 9.\n\nThat means we take actions from turn 0 to turn H-2 to move, and at turn H-1, we are at 9 without moving? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 0, we are at y_0=0.\n\nAction a_0 is taken, which determines y_1.\n\nThen at turn 1, we are at y_1, and so on.\n\nAt turn t, we are at position y_t, and we take action a_t to go to y_{t+1}.\n\nTo be at position 9 at turn T, we need y_T =9.\n\nFor that, the action at turn T-1 determines y_T, so if we want y_T=9, action at T-1 should move to 9.\n\nBut at turn T, we are at 9, and we don't necessarily take an action if T is the last turn.\n\nIn the sequence, actions are from t=0 to H-1, and y_{H-1} =9.\n\nSo at turn H-1, position is 9, and we have taken actions a_0 to a_{H-1}, but action a_{H-1} is taken at turn H-1 to go from y_{H-1} to y_H, but if y_{H-1}=9, and we want to be at 9 at turn H-1, then action a_{H-1} might be S to stay, or move away, but since we want to be at 9, probably a_{H-1} is such that y_{H-1} = y_{H-2} + Δy_{H-2}, and y_{H-1}=9.\n\nLet's clarify the timeline.\n\n- Turn 0: position y_0 =0\n\n- Action a_0: determines Δy_0, so y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\n- Turn 1: position y_1\n\n- Action a_1: determines y_2 = y_1 + Δy_1\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn t: position y_t\n\n- Action a_t: determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, and we take action a_t to go to y_{t+1}.\n\nWe want for some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, and y_{H-1} =9.\n\nSo at turn H-1, position is 9.\n\nThat means that to achieve y_{H-1}=9, the action at turn H-2 determines y_{H-1}, so a_{H-2} is the action that brings us to 9 if we were at 8 or 10, etc.\n\nBut at turn H-1, we are at 9, and we may or may not take an action, but in the sequence, a_{H-1} is included, which would be for moving to y_H, but since we only care about reaching 9 at some turn, and stopping, probably a_{H-1} can be S to stay, or we can stop when we reach.\n\nThe minimal H means the number of actions to be at 9 at turn H-1.\n\nSince we start at turn 0 at y=0, to reach y=9, the minimum number of moves is 9 up actions, but we have to avoid cars, so it might take more turns if we have to wait.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1, so to go from 0 to 9, minimum 9 up actions, but we might need to stay or down if there are obstacles.\n\nH is the number of actions, and we reach at turn H-1.\n\nFor example, if we do 9 ups, starting from turn 0: a0=U, y1=1; a1=U, y2=2; ... a8=U, y9=9. So at turn 9, y9=9, so H-1=9, H=10, actions from t=0 to 9, that's 10 actions, but at turn 9 we are at 9, which is H-1=9, H=10.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, that's H actions.\n\ny_{H-1} =9.\n\nIn this case, with 9 ups, y9=9, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nBut we can reach earlier if we start from 0, but we can only move one step at a time, so minimum 9 moves up to go from 0 to 9 in 9 actions, but let's see turns.\n\nAt turn 0, y0=0.\n\nAfter a0=U, turn 1, y1=1\n\na1=U, turn 2, y2=2\n\n...\n\na8=U, turn 9, y9=9\n\nSo at turn 9, y9=9, so H-1=9, H=10 actions.\n\nIf we do nothing at some point, it takes more turns.\n\nBut with only up, min 9 moves, 10 turns including start? Turn from 0 to 9, 10 turns, but position at turn 9 is 9.\n\nThe turn when we are at 9 is turn 9, which is t1 + H -1 = 0 + H -1, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nSimilarly, if we can move faster, but we can only change by 1 each action, so min H=10 for 9 ups.\n\nBut we have to avoid cars, so it might be more.\n\nNow, the key is to find when it is safe to be on each freeway.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8, and we need to pass through them.\n\nAt each turn, when we are on a freeway, we need that 0 is not in the car span for that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nLet's read carefully:\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo at turn T, when you take action, you are at position y_T.\n\nYou take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, you are on freeway y_T, so you can collide with cars on y_T at turn T if 0 in span.\n\nThen after action, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and can collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nIf you move from y_T to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, you are only on y_T, not on y_{T+1}, so for collision on y_{T+1}, it only matters at turn T+1 when you are there.\n\nSimilarly, when you arrive at a freeway, you are on it at that turn.\n\nFor example, to go from y=0 to y=1, at some turn, you move to y=1.\n\nAt the turn when you are at y=1, you need no collision on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, since we start at y=0, which is safe, and end at y=9, safe, we need to pass through y=1 to 8, each at some turn.\n\nFor each freeway, we need to be on it at a turn when no car has 0 in its span.\n\nThat is, for freeway k, at turn T, if we are on it, then 0 not in span_k(T).\n\nspan_k(T) is the car span on freeway k at turn T.\n\nSince each freeway has only one car, I think, from the table.\n\nFreeway 1 has one car, freeway 2 has one, etc., each has one car listed.\n\nSo for each k, there is one car, with its span at time T.\n\nNow, for freeway k, we need to find a time T when 0 is not in span_k(T), and we can be on that freeway at that time.\n\nBut we also need to move between freeways with the actions.\n\nSince we can only change y by 1 each turn, we will be on each y from 0 to 9 sequentially, but we can stay or move up/down, so we might not be on all, or stay on some multiple times, but to minimize turns, we probably want to go up as fast as possible, only staying or down if necessary to avoid collision.\n\nSo ideally, we go up one step each turn, but we need to ensure that when we are on y=k for k=1 to 8, at that turn, it is safe.\n\nLet's find for each freeway k, the times when it is safe, i.e., 0 not in span.\n\nThen we need to schedule our path so that when we are on y=k, it is a safe time for k.\n\nSince we move sequentially, we can think of the time when we first reach each level.\n\nBut we might stay or go down, but for min time, we should avoid unnecessary moves.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each freeway the times when 0 is not in the car span.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nCar: initial span [37,48] at T=0, right-moving, speed 12, so span at T: [37 + 12T, 48 + 12T]\n\nCollision if 0 in [37+12T, 48+12T]\n\nThat is, if 37+12T <= 0 <= 48+12T\n\nSince the numbers are large positive, and increasing, let's see when this interval contains 0.\n\n37+12T <= 0? 37+12T is always positive for T>=0, since min at T=0 is 37>0, so 37+12T >0 for all T, and 48+12T >0, so 0 is always less than the left end, so 0 not in [37+12T, 48+12T] for any T, because the interval is always positive.\n\n37+12T >=37 >0, so left end >0, so 0 < left end, so 0 not in interval. Similarly, right end >0. So for freeway 1, at all turns T, 0 not in span, so it is always safe to be on y=1.\n\nIs that right? Span at T: [37+12T, 48+12T], both ends positive and increasing, so yes, 0 is always less than 37+12T, so not in the closed interval. So no collision possible on freeway 1 ever. Great.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2\n\nCar: initial span [-59,-48] at T=0, right-moving, speed 6, so at T: [-59 + 6T, -48 + 6T]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-59+6T, -48+6T]\n\nThat is, if -59+6T <= 0 <= -48+6T\n\nWhich means:\n\n-59+6T <= 0 => 6T <= 59 => T <= 59/6 = 9.833, so T <= 9 since T integer\n\nAnd 0 <= -48+6T => 48 <= 6T => T >= 48/6 = 8\n\nSo for T=8,9\n\nCheck:\n\nT=8: left: -59 + 48 = -11, right: -48 + 48 =0, so span [-11,0], and 0 is included, so 0 in span, collision.\n\nT=9: left: -59 + 54 = -5, right: -48 + 54 =6, span [-5,6], 0 in it, collision.\n\nT=7: left: -59 + 42 = -17, right: -48 + 42 = -6, span [-17,-6], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nT=10: left: -59 + 60 =1, right: -48 + 60 =12, span [1,12], all positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSafe when T <=7 or T>=10.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, car identical, so same safe times: collision at T=8,9, safe otherwise.\n\nFreeway 4: same, identical car, same as 2 and 3.\n\nFreeway 5: same, identical.\n\nIn the table, freeway 2,3,4,5 all have the same car: head=-48, tail=-59, right, speed=6, so all have the same span and same collision times.\n\nSo for y=2,3,4,5, collision at T=8 and T=9 only, safe for other T.\n\nNow freeway 6: y=6\n\nCar: initial span [-83,-48] at T=0, speed 36, right-moving, at T: [-83 + 36T, -48 + 36T]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-83+36T, -48+36T]\n\nSo -83+36T <= 0 <= -48+36T\n\nLeft: -83+36T <=0 => 36T <=83 => T <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so T<=2\n\nRight: 0 <= -48+36T => 48 <=36T => T >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so T>=2 since T integer\n\nT>= ceil(48/36)= ceil(4/3)=2? 48/36=4/3=1.333, ceil to 2? T must be integer.\n\n0 <= -48+36T => 36T >=48 => T >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so since T integer, T>=2\n\nAnd -83+36T <=0 => 36T <=83 => T <= 83/36 ≈2.305, so T<=2\n\nThus T=2\n\nCheck T=2: left: -83 + 72 = -11, right: -48 + 72 =24, span [-11,24], 0 in it.\n\nT=1: left: -83 + 36 = -47, right: -48 + 36 = -12, span [-47,-12], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nT=3: left: -83 + 108 =25, right: -48 + 108 =60, span [25,60], all positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo collision only at T=2.\n\nSafe for T≠2.\n\nNow freeway 7: y=7\n\nCar: initial span [-95,-48] at T=0, speed 48, at T: [-95 + 48T, -48 + 48T]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-95+48T, -48+48T]\n\nSo -95+48T <=0 <= -48+48T\n\nLeft: -95+48T <=0 => 48T <=95 => T <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so T<=1\n\nRight: 0 <= -48+48T => 48T >=48 => T>=1\n\nThus T=1\n\nCheck T=1: left: -95 + 48 = -47, right: -48 + 48 =0, span [-47,0], 0 included, collision.\n\nT=0: span [-95,-48], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nT=2: left: -95 + 96 =1, right: -48 + 96 =48, span [1,48], all positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo collision only at T=1.\n\nSafe for T≠1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: y=8, same as 7, car identical, collision only at T=1, safe otherwise.\n\nNow, summarize the dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: always safe\n\n- y=2: unsafe at T=8,9\n\n- y=3: unsafe at T=8,9 (same as y=2)\n\n- y=4: unsafe at T=8,9\n\n- y=5: unsafe at T=8,9\n\n- y=6: unsafe at T=2\n\n- y=7: unsafe at T=1\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=1\n\nWe start at turn 0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn T.\n\nSince we can only change y by ±1 or 0 each turn, the position changes slowly.\n\nTo minimize time, we should go up as fast as possible, except when we need to avoid being on a dangerous freeway at a bad time.\n\nWe can stay at y=0 or y=9 or other levels, but y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=9 is the target, also safe.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and need to go to y=9, min 9 up moves, taking at least 9 turns to reach, so min turn to be at y=9 is turn 9, as in the direct path.\n\nBut we need to check if we can go directly up without being on unsafe positions at wrong times.\n\nLet's simulate the direct path: go up every turn.\n\nTurn 0: y=0, safe (not on freeway)\n\nAction a0: U, go to y=1\n\nTurn 1: y=1, on freeway 1, which is always safe, so ok.\n\nAction a1: U, to y=2\n\nTurn 2: y=2, on freeway 2.\n\nNow, freeway 2 is unsafe at T=8,9, but T=2 is safe (since unsafe only at 8,9), so ok.\n\nAction a2: U, to y=3\n\nTurn 3: y=3, on freeway 3, unsafe at T=8,9, T=3 safe, ok.\n\nAction a3: U, to y=4\n\nTurn 4: y=4, freeway 4, unsafe at T=8,9, T=4 safe, ok.\n\nAction a4: U, to y=5\n\nTurn 5: y=5, freeway 5, unsafe at T=8,9, T=5 safe, ok.\n\nAction a5: U, to y=6\n\nTurn 6: y=6, freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe only at T=2, T=6 safe, so ok.\n\nAction a6: U, to y=7\n\nTurn 7: y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at T=1, T=7 safe (since unsafe only at T=1), so ok.\n\nAction a7: U, to y=8\n\nTurn 8: y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at T=1, T=8 safe? Unsafe at T=1, but T=8, should be safe.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe only at T=1, so at T=8, safe.\n\nAction a8: U, to y=9\n\nTurn 9: y=9, safe, reached.\n\nIn this path, at turn 8, y=8, freeway 8 is safe because unsafe only at T=1.\n\nSimilarly, all steps seem safe.\n\nBut we need to reach at turn H-1 with y=9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 9, y=9, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions: a0 to a8, all U.\n\na0 to a8, that's 9 actions, from t=0 to 8, H=9 actions? Let's count.\n\nActions: a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8 → 9 actions.\n\nAt turn 9, after a8, y9=9.\n\ny_{H-1} = y9, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nBut actions from t=0 to H-1=9, so t=0 to 9, but a9 would be for turn 9, but in this case, we don't need a9 since we are at 9 at turn 9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions are up to a_{H-1}, and y_{H-1}=9.\n\nIn the path above, with a0 to a8 (9 actions), we have y9=9, so at turn 9, position 9.\n\nSo H-1=9, H=10, actions a0 to a9? No.\n\ny_{H-1} =9, and actions a_{t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAt turn H-1, position is y_{H-1}, which is 9.\n\nTo have y_{H-1}=9, we need to reach 9 at turn H-1.\n\nFor example, in the path: at turn 8, y8=8 (after a7=U from y7).\n\nThen action a8=U, so y9=9 at turn 9.\n\nSo y9=9, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions: a0 to a9? t from 0 to H-1=9, so a0 to a9.\n\nBut a9 is taken at turn 9, which would determine y10, but we don't care about y10, since we are done at turn 9.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn H-1, we might need an action, but if we are at 9, we can do S or something.\n\nIn this case, with a0 to a8 all U, we have:\n\nTurn 0: y0=0, action a0=U\n\nTurn 1: y1=1\n\n...\n\nTurn 8: y8=8, action a8=U\n\nTurn 9: y9=9\n\nNow, at turn 9, we are at 9, so to have y_{H-1}=9, we can set H-1=9, so H=10.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to 9: a0 to a9.\n\nBut a9 is at turn 9, which is not needed since we are at 9. So we can set a9=S, for example, to stay.\n\nBut in the minimal path, we don't need to take action after reaching, but the sequence must include actions until we reach.\n\nAccording to the task, we need a sequence of H actions to reach at turn H-1.\n\nSo for the direct path, with 9 up actions, we reach at turn 9.\n\nSo actions: a0=U, a1=U, ..., a8=U, and then at turn 9, we need a9, but since we are at 9, we can do a9=S.\n\nBut y9=9, and action a9=S, then y10=9, but we don't care.\n\nTo minimize H, we should not have extra actions.\n\nIn this case, with a0 to a8 all U, we are at y9=9 at turn 9.\n\nThen for the sequence, we can have actions a0 to a8, all U, and H=9? Then y_{H-1} = y8=8, not 9.\n\nProblem: y_{H-1} must be 9.\n\nWith actions from t=0 to H-1, and y_{H-1}=9.\n\nIf we have H actions, after H actions, we are at y_H.\n\nBut y_{H-1} is before the last action.\n\nAt turn H-1, position y_{H-1}, then we take action a_{H-1}, which determines y_H.\n\nWe want y_{H-1} =9.\n\nThat means at turn H-1, we are already at 9, and we take some action, but since we are at 9, and y must be in [0,9], we can do S to stay, or if we do U or D, it might go out, but we can stay.\n\nIn the condition, we want to reach (0,9), so at some turn be at 9, but the minimal H is defined with y_{H-1}=9.\n\nSo to have y_{H-1}=9, we need to be at 9 at turn H-1, which could be by moving to it or staying.\n\nIn the direct up path, we are at 9 at turn 9, which is after 9 actions (a0 to a8).\n\nBut at turn 9, y9=9, which would be y_{H-1} if H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen actions a0 to a9, with a9=S for example.\n\nBut H=10, which is larger than necessary? No, min to go from 0 to 9 is 9 moves, 10 turns including start.\n\nTurn 0 to turn 9, 10 turns, position at turn 9.\n\nIf we could reach faster, but we can't, since max +1 per turn.\n\nSo min H is 10 for this path.\n\nBut in this path, is it safe? Earlier I thought it was, but let's double-check the dangerous points.\n\nIn the path:\n\nTurn 1: y=1, safe\n\nTurn 2: y=2, safe (T=2 not 8 or 9)\n\nTurn 3: y=3, safe\n\nTurn 4: y=4, safe\n\nTurn 5: y=5, safe\n\nTurn 6: y=6, safe (T=6, not 2)\n\nTurn 7: y=7, safe (T=7, not 1)\n\nTurn 8: y=8, safe (T=8, but freeway 8 unsafe at T=1, not T=8)\n\nT=8 for y=8, freeway 8 unsafe only at T=1, so T=8 safe.\n\nThen turn 9: y=9, safe.\n\nBut at turn 8, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at T=1, T=8 ok.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nBut freeway 2,3,4,5 are unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nIn this path, at T=8, we are on y=8, which is freeway 8, not freeway 2,3,4,5.\n\nFreeway 2 is y=2, which we were on at turn 2, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, we are on y=9, not on any freeway.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus the direct path works with H=10.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier? No, because min 9 moves.\n\nTurn 0 at 0, after 1 move at turn 1 y=1, ..., after 9 moves at turn 9 y=9.\n\nSo min turn to be at 9 is turn 9, so min H-1=9, H=10.\n\nPerhaps we can reach with fewer actions if we start higher, but we start at 0.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 0, we are at y=0, we can take action immediately.\n\nBut we need to be at 9 at some turn.\n\nMin is turn 9 with 9 up actions.\n\nIn the above, with all U, it seems safe.\n\nBut let's confirm freeway 6 and 7.\n\nAt turn 6, y=6, freeway 6 unsafe at T=2, T=6 safe.\n\nTurn 7, y=7, freeway 7 unsafe at T=1, T=7 safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 2,3,4,5 all have the same car, and unsafe at T=8,9.\n\nBut in the path, we are not on them at those times.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps for y=7 and y=8, they are unsafe at T=1, but we are on them at T=7 and T=8, which are safe.\n\nSo the direct path should work.\n\nBut let's see the answer format, it should be a sequence.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,0) at turn t1=0.\n\nActions from t=0.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 0: action a0\n\nTurn 1: a1, etc.\n\nIn this case, a0=U, a1=U, ..., a8=U, and then for turn 9, we need a9, but since we reach at turn 9 with y9=9, which is after a8, so at turn 9, we are at 9, so for the sequence to have y_{H-1}=9, we need H-1=9, so H=10, actions a0 to a9.\n\na9 can be S, for example.\n\nTo avoid extra action, we can reach at turn 8 or something, but we can't, since from 0 to 9, min 9 moves.\n\nUnless we start moving later, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if we stay at 0 for some turns, then move, it takes longer.\n\nSo min H is 10.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach by turn 8.\n\nAt turn 0, y=0.\n\nIf we could be at y=9 at turn 8, that would require increasing by 9 in 8 actions, but each action max +1, so from turn 0 to turn 8, after 8 actions, y8 <=8, since y0=0, y8 <= y0 +8 =8, so at turn 8, y8<=8, cannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, min turn for y=9 is turn 9.\n\ny_t <= y0 + t = t, so at turn t, y_t <= t, so for y_t=9, t>=9.\n\nThus min turn to be at 9 is turn 9.\n\nSo H-1=9, H=10 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, with all U, it works, as above.\n\nBut is there a collision I missed?\n\nFreeway 6: at T=2 unsafe, but we are on y=6 at turn 6, not T=2.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps for y=2 at turn 2, is it safe? Yes, unsafe only at T=8,9.\n\nBut y=2 is freeway 2, which has car, unsafe at T=8,9, not at T=2.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the car for freeway 2, at T=2, span is [-59 + 6*2, -48 + 6*2] = [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36], all negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but there is freeway 3,4,5 with same car, but we are on them at turns 3,4,5, all safe.\n\nNow, for y=7 at turn 7: freeway 7, car span at T=7: [-95 + 48*7, -48 + 48*7] = [-95 + 336, -48 + 336] = [241, 288], all positive, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at T=8: span [-95+384, -48+384]=[289,336], safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10, with actions: a0=U, a1=U, a2=U, a3=U, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, and since we need H=10 actions, a9 can be S, but at turn 9, we are at y9=9, and if we set a9=S, then y10=9, but we only care about reaching at turn 9.\n\nIn the sequence, we must specify actions up to a_{H-1}.\n\nFor turn 9, action a9, which can be S.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nSince we reach at turn 9 with y9=9, and we need y_{H-1}=9, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions: for turn 0 to 9.\n\nBut turn 0 to 9 is 10 turns, actions at each turn.\n\nAt turn 9, we can choose to stay.\n\nIn the output, it should be the sequence to reach.\n\nBut let's see if we can have H smaller, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at an earlier turn by moving down or something, but no, since we start from 0, we need to increase to 9.\n\nUnless we go down from higher, but we start at 0, min is 9.\n\nSo I think H=10 is min.\n\nBut in the sequence, with a0 to a8 all U, we have 9 actions, and y9=9 at turn 9.\n\nBut for y_{H-1}=9, with H-1=9, we need H=10, so one more action.\n\nSo we need to include a9.\n\na9 can be S.\n\nIf we set a9=S, then at turn 9, we take action S, but we are already at 9, so it stays.\n\ny9=9, action a9=S, y10=9.\n\nBut the position at turn 9 is 9, which is what we want.\n\nIn terms of the turn when we are first at 9, it is turn 9.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 1, which is always safe, but we are on it at turn 1, fine.\n\nAnother thing: the note about moving.\n\nFor example, when we move from y=0 to y=1 at turn 0, action a0=U, so at turn 1, we are on y=1.\n\nAt turn 0, we are on y=0, not a freeway.\n\nSimilarly, when we move from y=8 to y=9 at turn 8, action a8=U, so at turn 9, we are on y=9.\n\nNo issue with the collision rule.\n\nThe note says if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, which is consistent.\n\nIn this case, no problem.\n\nSo I think the direct path works.\n\nBut why is freeway 6 unsafe at T=2 and freeway 7 at T=1, but we are not on them at those times.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought freeway 2-5 unsafe at T=8,9, but we are on y=8 at T=8 and y=9 at T=9, not on y=2-5.\n\ny=2-5 are lower.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, minimal sequence is all U for 9 actions, but with H=10, we need 10 actions.\n\nSo actions: a0=U, a1=U, a2=U, a3=U, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=S\n\nBut a9=S at turn 9, after we are at 9.\n\nSince y_{H-1}=9, and we take action a_{H-1}, which can be S.\n\nTo avoid the extra S, we could have reached at turn 8, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps we can be at 9 at turn 8 if we start from higher, but we start at 0.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 0, we are at y=0, we can stay or move.\n\nIf we stay at turn 0, y=0, then later move, but it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, if we stay at 0 for K turns, then we reach 9 at turn 9+K, later.\n\nSo min is to move up immediately.\n\nThus, the sequence should be U for turns 0 to 8, and S for turn 9, but turn 9 action.\n\nIn the output format.\n\nBut let's see the answer should be in a box.\n\nPerhaps for turn 9, since we are at 9, and we need to output action, we can output S.\n\nBut in the minimal path, we have to include it because H=10.\n\nTo have y_{H-1}=9 with smaller H, but impossible.\n\nUnless we reach at turn 8, but y8 <=8.\n\nSuppose we are at y=8 at turn 8, then action a8=S, so y9=8? No, we need y_{H-1}=9.\n\nIf at turn 8, y8=8, then to have y8=9, impossible, since y8 <=8.\n\ny_{H-1} must be 9, so the earliest is turn 9.\n\nThus H-1=9, H=10.\n\nSo we must have 10 actions.\n\nThus the sequence is:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U  (to go to y=9 at turn 9)\n\nThen at turn 9, we need an action, say S.\n\nSince we are at 9, and we can stay.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 9: S\n\nThen y10=9, but we don't care.\n\nThe position at turn 9 is 9, reached.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the action sequence, for turn 9, we output S.\n\nTo be consistent, we can output U for all, but at turn 9, if we output U, y10=10, but y=10 is invalid, since y in [0,9], so we must not go above 9.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=9, and we do U, it should not go to 10, probably clipped to 9, or not allowed, but the constraint says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so I think it stays at 9 if we try to go up.\n\nSimilarly for down at 0.\n\nSo we can do U at turn 9, but y10= min(9, y9 +1) =10? No, the constraint is y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=9 and a_t=U, y_{t+1} should be 9, I think, or it might be invalid, but to avoid issue, better to do S when at 9.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, at turn 9, y9=9, so a9=S is fine.\n\nNow, back to the cars, I think there is a problem with freeway 8 at turn 8.\n\nFreeway 8 is y=8, unsafe at T=1.\n\nAt turn 8, T=8, we are on y=8, and T=8 ≠1, so safe.\n\nBut let's list all positions and times:\n\nIn the path:\n\n- Turn 0: y=0, safe\n\n- Action a0=U\n\n- Turn 1: y=1, freeway 1, safe\n\n- Action a1=U\n\n- Turn 2: y=2, freeway 2, T=2, safe (not 8 or 9)\n\n- Action a2=U\n\n- Turn 3: y=3, freeway 3, T=3, safe\n\n- Action a3=U\n\n- Turn 4: y=4, freeway 4, T=4, safe\n\n- Action a4=U\n\n- Turn 5: y=5, freeway 5, T=5, safe\n\n- Action a5=U\n\n- Turn 6: y=6, freeway 6, T=6, safe (not 2)\n\n- Action a6=U\n\n- Turn 7: y=7, freeway 7, T=7, safe (not 1)\n\n- Action a7=U\n\n- Turn 8: y=8, freeway 8, T=8, safe (not 1)\n\n- Action a8=U\n\n- Turn 9: y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nBut freeway 2,3,4,5 are unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nAt T=8, we are on y=8, which is freeway 8, not freeway 2,3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly at T=9, on y=9.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nThus, the sequence is valid.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=10, with actions U from turn 0 to 8, and S at turn 9? No.\n\nActions: for turn 0 to 9, but turn 9 action a9.\n\nIn the sequence, turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt1=0, t from 0 to 9, 10 actions.\n\na0 to a9.\n\na0 to a8: U, a9: S\n\nThen y_{H-1} = y9 =9.\n\nH-1=9, H=10.\n\nIf we set a9=U, but y9=9, y10=9, same, but S is fine.\n\nNow, in the output, we need to write the actions.\n\nBut for turn 9, since we are at 9, S is appropriate.\n\nNow, but let's see if we can do without the last S.\n\nSuppose we have only 9 actions: a0 to a8 all U.\n\nThen at turn 9, y9=9, but y_{H-1} with H-1=9, so for that, H=10, we need to include turn 9 action.\n\nIf we set H=9, then actions a0 to a8, y_{H-1}=y8=8, not 9.\n\nSo we must have H=10.\n\nThus, the sequence must include 10 actions.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps the problem allows to stop when reached, but according to the definition, we need to specify the sequence until we reach.\n\nSo output:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nBut for turn 9, since we are at 9, and we do S, it stays.\n\nIn the action, at turn 8, we do U to go from 8 to 9, so at turn 9, we arrive.\n\nThen at turn 9, we do S to stay.\n\nBut the position at turn 9 is 9, which is reached.\n\nTo save an action, but we can't.\n\nAnother thought: can we be at 9 at turn 8?\n\nOnly if we start from higher, but we start at 0.\n\nSuppose at turn 0, we do nothing, but then later.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think H=10 is min.\n\nBut let's check if at some point we must avoid.\n\nFor example, at turn 8, if we were on y=5, it would be unsafe, but we are on y=8.\n\nIn this path, no issue.\n\nBut freeway 6 is unsafe at T=2, but we are on it at T=6, fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps for y=7 at T=1, but we are at T=7.\n\nBut T=1 is early, we are not on it then.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is 10 turns with actions as above.\n\nBut in the output, for turn 9: S.\n\nPerhaps we can output only up to turn 8, but then y8=8, not 9.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think we have to.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ S} \\end{array} }\\]\n\nH=10, turns from 0 to 9.\n\nIn the sequence, turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, with H=10, t from 0 to 9.\n\nYes.\n\nTo avoid the S, but I think it's necessary.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn 9 with no action at turn 9, but the sequence includes actions until the reach turn.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) is 10. This is achieved with a sequence of 9 \"U\" (up) actions followed by 1 \"S\" (stay) action, ensuring the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 9 and stays there at turn 10, avoiding all car collisions on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Always safe, as the car span \\([37 + 12T, 48 + 12T]\\) never contains 0 for any \\(T \\geq 0\\). The player is on this freeway at turn 1, which is safe.\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Unsafe at turns 8 and 9. The player is on this freeway at turn 2, where the span \\([-59 + 6 \\times 2, -48 + 6 \\times 2] = [-47, -36]\\) does not contain 0, so it is safe.\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Identical to freeway 2, unsafe at turns 8 and 9. Player is on it at turn 3, safe.\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Identical to freeway 2, unsafe at turns 8 and 9. Player is on it at turn 4, safe.\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Identical to freeway 2, unsafe at turns 8 and 9. Player is on it at turn 5, safe.\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Unsafe at turn 2. Player is on it at turn 6, where the span \\([-83 + 36 \\times 6, -48 + 36 \\times 6] = [133, 168]\\) does not contain 0, so it is safe.\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Unsafe at turn 1. Player is on it at turn 7, where the span \\([-95 + 48 \\times 7, -48 + 48 \\times 7] = [241, 288]\\) does not contain 0, so it is safe.\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Identical to freeway 7, unsafe at turn 1. Player is on it at turn 8, where the span \\([-95 + 48 \\times 8, -48 + 48 \\times 8] = [289, 336]\\) does not contain 0, so it is safe.\n\nAt turn 9, the player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway, so no collision is possible. The \"S\" action at turn 9 ensures the player remains at \\(y = 9\\).\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}_{t=0}^{9}\\) is as follows:\n\n- At turn 0, move up to \\(y = 1\\).\n- At turns 1 to 8, continue moving up to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 9.\n- At turn 9, stay to remain at \\(y = 9\\) (action not strictly necessary but included to satisfy \\(H = 10\\) and \\(y_{9} = 9\\)).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ S} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are starting at (0,1) at turn t1=1 and want to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H.\n The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position is between 0 and 9.\n\n Important: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 (the player's x-coordinate is always 0).\n\n Note: When the player moves from y to y' at turn T, they are considered to be on freeway y at turn T. Only at the next turn (if they move) will they be on y'. So at the moment of the move (turn T), they are still on the original freeway.\n\n We are given the car states at turn t1=1 for freeways 1 to 8.\n\n We need to compute the car spans for future turns. The car moves at constant speed.\n\n For a left-moving car: the span at time T (relative to t1=1) is [h - s*(T-1), tau - s*(T-1)]\n For a right-moving car: the span at time T is [tau + s*(T-1), h + s*(T-1)]\n\n However, note the initial state is at turn t1=1. So at turn T (>=1), the time elapsed is (T-1) turns.\n\n But note: the problem says \"at turn T > t1\", so for T=1 we use the given state.\n\n However, the collision condition is at turn T: we are on freeway y_T and we require that 0 is in the span of the car on that freeway at turn T.\n\n We start at turn 1 at y=1.\n\n We must avoid being on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when the car on that freeway at turn T has 0 in its span.\n\n The goal is to reach y=9. Note that y=0 and y=9 are safe because there are no cars (only freeways 1-8 have cars).\n\n However, the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, ..., 8\". So when we are at y=0 or y=9, we don't check for cars.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We are at (0,1) at turn 1. We are on freeway 1 at turn 1. We must check if there is a collision at turn 1 on freeway 1.\n\n 2. We can simulate the future car positions for each freeway for each future turn.\n\n 3. We are to find the minimal H and a sequence of actions.\n\n Approach:\n We can use BFS (breadth-first search) over states (turn, y) but note that the turn can be up to ...? We need to compute until we reach y=9.\n\n However, note that the cars are moving continuously and we are only concerned when we are on a freeway (y from 1 to 8) at a specific turn.\n\n We need to check for each freeway at each turn whether 0 is in the car's span.\n\n Let me precompute the car spans for each freeway for a range of turns. Since the cars move at constant speed and the grid is infinite, we need to compute when the car's span covers 0.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the collision condition for a freeway k at turn T is:\n\n   Let T0 = T - 1 (since we start at turn1, so time elapsed = T-1)\n\n   For a right-moving car (d='right'): the span at turn T is [tau + s*(T-1), h + s*(T-1)]\n        condition: tau + s*(T-1) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-1)\n\n   For a left-moving car (d='left'): [h - s*(T-1), tau - s*(T-1)] -> but note that the head and tail are given such that for left-moving, h is the front? Actually the problem says for left-moving: initially [h, tau] and then becomes [h - s*(T-1), tau - s*(T-1)]. So the car moves left.\n\n But note: in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Let's check:\n\n   Freeway 1: (60,49,right,12) -> wait, 60 to 49? That doesn't make sense for right-moving because the head should be greater than the tail? \n   But the problem says for right-moving: initially [tau, h] and then becomes [tau+s*(T-1), h+s*(T-1)].\n\n   Actually, the problem states:\n        Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n   So for freeway 1: at turn1, the car is from 49 to 60? But the table says (60,49,right,12). \n   This is confusing. Let me read the table: \n        \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\"\n\n   For right-moving, the head is the front (so the larger coordinate) and the tail is the rear? \n   But the problem says: \n        Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] \n\n   So if h is the head and tau is the tail, then for right-moving we have [tau, h] meaning from tail to head (so increasing order). \n\n   However, in freeway1: head=60, tail=49 -> so the car at turn1 is from 49 to 60? That makes sense: the car is at positions 49,50,...,60.\n\n   Then at turn T, it becomes [49+12*(T-1), 60+12*(T-1)].\n\n   Similarly, freeway2: (-42,-53,right,6) -> head=-42, tail=-53 -> so the car is from -53 to -42? \n        Then at turn T: [-53+6*(T-1), -42+6*(T-1)]\n\n   But note: the car might be long. We have to check if 0 is in the interval.\n\n   Let me check freeway1 at turn1: [49,60] -> 0 is not in [49,60] -> safe at turn1 for freeway1? But we are at freeway1 at turn1.\n\n   Actually, we are at (0,1) at turn1. The car on freeway1 is at positions 49 to 60. 0 is not in [49,60]. So no collision at turn1.\n\n   But wait, the player is at x=0 and the car is at x from 49 to 60 -> no collision.\n\n   Similarly, freeway2: [-53,-42] at turn1 -> 0 is not in this interval.\n\n   However, let's check freeway7: (0,-47,right,48) -> at turn1: [-47,0]? \n        Because: [tau, h] = [-47,0] -> so the car is from -47 to 0. Then 0 is included? \n        So at turn1, freeway7 has a car that occupies 0? \n\n        But note: the player is at freeway1 at turn1, not freeway7. So we are safe.\n\n   However, if we move to freeway7 at some turn, we must check.\n\n   Now, the problem: we start at y=1 (freeway1) at turn1. We are safe at turn1 because the car on freeway1 does not cover 0.\n\n   We need to plan a sequence of actions to go from y=1 to y=9, avoiding collisions.\n\n   The minimal number of moves? Since we are at y=1 and want to go to y=9, the minimal without cars is 8 moves (each U). But we have to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at 0.\n\n   We can also move down? But we are at y=1 and the goal is y=9, so moving down is counterproductive. However, sometimes we might have to wait (by staying) or even move down to avoid a car and then go up? But note we can also stay.\n\n   We are only concerned with freeways 1 to 8. The safe zones are y=0 and y=9.\n\n   Since we start at y=1 and want to go to y=9, we must pass through y=2,3,...,8. But we can skip some by moving faster? Actually, we can only change by at most 1 per turn.\n\n   So we must go through each freeway in between? Not necessarily: we can stay at a freeway for multiple turns? But we want minimal turns.\n\n   However, we might have to wait at a freeway if the car is going to pass 0 at a time when we would be there? But note we can also change our vertical position to avoid being on that freeway at the dangerous turn.\n\n   We can simulate for a few turns.\n\n   Precomputation: for each freeway k and for each turn T (starting from T=1 to ... until we have a solution) we compute whether the car on that freeway at turn T has 0 in its span.\n\n   How to compute:\n\n      For a right-moving car: \n          Let A = tau + s*(T-1)\n          Let B = h + s*(T-1)\n          Then 0 in [A, B]  <=>  A <= 0 <= B.\n\n      For left-moving car: \n          A = h - s*(T-1)\n          B = tau - s*(T-1)   [but note: in the problem, for left-moving, the initial span is [h, tau] and becomes [h-s*(T-1), tau-s*(T-1)]\n          But note: if h > tau, then the initial span is from h down to tau? Actually, the problem does not specify the order? \n\n      However, in the given data, all cars are right-moving. So we don't have left-moving.\n\n   So only right-moving cars.\n\n   Now, let's list the freeways and their car parameters:\n\n      k=1: tau=49, h=60, s=12 -> [49+12*(T-1), 60+12*(T-1)]\n        Condition: 49+12*(T-1) <= 0 <= 60+12*(T-1) \n        -> 12*(T-1) >= -49 and 12*(T-1) <= -60? \n        But note: -60 is negative and T>=1, so 12*(T-1)>=0. Then 0>=60+12*(T-1) is impossible because 60+12*(T-1)>=60>0. \n        So freeway1 is always safe? \n\n      k=2: tau=-53, h=-42, s=6 -> [-53+6*(T-1), -42+6*(T-1)]\n        Condition: -53+6*(T-1) <= 0 <= -42+6*(T-1)\n        -> Solve:\n            First inequality: 6*(T-1) <= 53 -> T-1 <= 53/6 ~ 8.83 -> T<=9.83 -> T<=9\n            Second inequality: 0 <= -42+6*(T-1) -> 42 <= 6*(T-1) -> T-1>=7 -> T>=8.\n        So T in [8,9] -> dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\n      k=3: same as k=2 -> dangerous at T=8,9.\n      k=4: same -> dangerous at T=8,9.\n      k=5: same -> dangerous at T=8,9.\n\n      k=6: tau=-47, h=-12, s=36 -> [-47+36*(T-1), -12+36*(T-1)]\n        Condition: \n            -47+36*(T-1) <= 0 <= -12+36*(T-1)\n            -> First: 36*(T-1) <= 47 -> T-1 <= 47/36 ~ 1.305 -> T<=2.305 -> T=2 is the only integer? \n            -> Second: 0 <= -12+36*(T-1) -> 12 <= 36*(T-1) -> T-1>=1/3 -> T>=1.33 -> T>=2.\n        So only at T=2: \n            At T=2: [-47+36, -12+36] = [-11,24] -> 0 is in [-11,24]? Yes, because -11<=0<=24.\n        So freeway6 is dangerous at T=2.\n\n      k=7: tau=-47, h=0, s=48 -> [-47+48*(T-1), 0+48*(T-1)] = [-47+48*(T-1), 48*(T-1)]\n        Condition: -47+48*(T-1) <= 0 <= 48*(T-1)\n        The second inequality: 0 <= 48*(T-1) -> T>=1 (so always true for T>=1).\n        First inequality: -47+48*(T-1) <= 0 -> 48*(T-1) <= 47 -> T-1 <= 47/48 < 1 -> T<=2.\n        So T=1: \n            [-47,0] -> 0 is included? Yes, because the interval is [-47,0] -> 0 is the endpoint? \n            So at T=1, the car is at [-47,0] -> includes 0 -> dangerous.\n\n        But note: we are at turn1 and we are on freeway1, not freeway7. So at turn1, freeway7 is dangerous, but we are not there.\n\n        What about T=2?\n            [-47+48, 48] = [1,48] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n\n        So freeway7 is dangerous only at T=1.\n\n      k=8: same as k7: (0,-47,right,48) -> same as k7? Actually the table says (0,-47,right,48) for k8? \n            But the table for k7 is also (0,-47,right,48). \n            So k8: same as k7 -> dangerous only at T=1.\n\n   Summary of dangerous freeways at dangerous turns:\n\n      freeway2,3,4,5: dangerous at T=8,9.\n      freeway6: dangerous at T=2.\n      freeway7,8: dangerous at T=1.\n\n   We are at turn1 at y=1 (freeway1). We are safe at turn1.\n\n   We want to get to y=9. We can only move one step at a time.\n\n   We must avoid:\n\n        At turn T=2: we cannot be on freeway6 (because dangerous at T=2).\n        At turn T=8: we cannot be on freeways 2,3,4,5.\n        At turn T=9: we cannot be on freeways 2,3,4,5.\n\n   Also, at turn T=1, we are at y=1 (safe) and we don't have to worry about freeways 7,8 because we are not there.\n\n   Now, we plan:\n\n        We start at turn1: y1=1.\n\n        Turn2: we can choose U, D, or S.\n\n        We want to minimize H, so we prefer moving up.\n\n        Option 1: \n            Turn1: S -> then we stay at y=1 for turn2? \n                But then at turn2 we are still at freeway1 -> safe? freeway1 is always safe? \n            But we are not making progress.\n\n        Option 2: \n            Turn1: U -> then at turn2 we are at y=2 (freeway2). \n                But at turn2, freeway2 is safe? \n                    We computed freeway2 is dangerous only at T=8 and T=9. So at turn2 (T=2) it is safe.\n                So we can go to y=2 at turn2.\n\n        Then turn2: we are at y=2. Now at turn2, we must avoid freeway6 (which is dangerous at T=2). But we are at freeway2, not freeway6 -> safe.\n\n        Then turn2: we can move U again -> to y=3 (freeway3) at turn3.\n\n        Similarly, we can keep moving up until we hit a problem.\n\n        What about the dangerous turns 8 and 9? We are moving one freeway per turn. We start at turn1 at y=1.\n\n            Turn1: y1=1\n            Turn2: y2=2\n            Turn3: y3=3\n            Turn4: y4=4\n            Turn5: y5=5\n            Turn6: y6=6\n            Turn7: y7=7\n            Turn8: y8=8\n            Turn9: we can then move to y9 (goal).\n\n        But at turn8, we are at freeway8 -> and freeway8 is dangerous only at T=1? So at T=8, freeway8 is safe? \n            Because we computed freeway8: dangerous only at T=1.\n\n        However, freeways 2,3,4,5 are dangerous at T=8 and T=9. But we are at freeway8 at turn8, not freeway2,3,4,5 -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn9: we move from y8=8 to y9=9 -> and we are done.\n\n        So H = 8 turns? But note: we start at turn1 and we take 8 actions? \n\n        Actually, we start at turn1 at position (0,1). Then:\n\n          Turn1: we take an action -> we are at turn1, then after the action we update to turn2.\n\n          We want to be at y=9 at turn (t1+H-1) = 1+H-1 = H.\n\n          So we need to be at y=9 at turn H.\n\n          How many actions? We do H-1 actions? Actually, the problem says: sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1 (so H actions?) \n\n          But note: the player update: \n                at turn t: we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, then we get y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\n          We start at turn1 at y1=1.\n\n          After H-1 actions, we have y_{1+(H-1)} = y_H.\n\n          We want y_H = 9.\n\n          So we need H-1 = 8? -> H=9? \n\n          But let me count:\n\n            Turn1 (start): y1=1\n            After action a1 (at turn1): we get y2 at turn2.\n            ... \n            After action a8 (at turn8): we get y9 at turn9.\n\n          So we are at (0,9) at turn9 -> H=9? \n\n          However, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" -> so t from 0 to H-1? \n\n          But note: t1=1, so the actions are at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1.\n\n          We want to minimize H. \n\n          But we have to avoid:\n\n            At turn2: we must not be on freeway6 -> we are at freeway2 -> safe.\n\n            At turn8: we are at freeway8 -> safe (because freeway8 dangerous only at T=1).\n\n            At turn9: we are at freeway9? Actually, when we move from freeway8 to freeway9 at turn9, note that at turn9 we are at freeway8 until we move? \n\n          How the movement works:\n\n            At turn8: we are at y8=8 (freeway8). We choose action U at turn8 -> then at turn9, we move to y9=9.\n\n            But at turn8: we are on freeway8 -> and we check: freeway8 at turn8: \n                freeway8: (0,-47,right,48) at turn8: \n                    [ -47 + 48*(8-1) , 0 + 48*(8-1) ] = [-47+48*7, 48*7] = [-47+336, 336] = [289,336] -> does not include 0 -> safe.\n\n            Then at turn9: we are at y9=9 -> safe (no car check).\n\n          So the plan:\n\n            Turn1: U -> y2 = 1+1 = 2 (freeway2) at turn2.\n            Turn2: U -> y3=3 at turn3.\n            Turn3: U -> y4=4 at turn4.\n            Turn4: U -> y5=5 at turn5.\n            Turn5: U -> y6=6 at turn6.\n            Turn6: U -> y7=7 at turn7.\n            Turn7: U -> y8=8 at turn8.\n            Turn8: U -> y9=9 at turn9.\n\n          Then we have taken 8 actions? But the problem says the sequence is from t1 (which is 1) to t1+H-1. We have 8 actions: turn1 to turn8 -> so H=8? \n\n          However, after 8 actions we are at turn9? \n\n          The problem: we start at turn1. After one action (at turn1) we are at turn2. After two actions (turn1 and turn2) we are at turn3. ... after 8 actions (turn1 to turn8) we are at turn9.\n\n          We are at (0,9) at turn9 -> so we have taken 8 actions and the total turns from start to finish is 9 turns? \n\n          But the minimal H is defined as the number of turns? Actually the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", but note:\n\n            \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" \n\n          This sequence has H actions. And we are at the goal at turn t1 + H? \n\n          Actually, the update: \n                At turn t1 (current) we are at (0,y_{t1}).\n                Then we take action a_{t1} -> we get y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n                ... \n                Then we take action a_{t1+H-1} -> we get y_{t1+H} at turn t1+H.\n\n          We want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\n          So we are at turn t1+H = 1+H.\n\n          We want to be at 9 at turn 1+H.\n\n          In our plan: we are at 9 at turn9 -> so 1+H=9 -> H=8.\n\n          Therefore, the sequence has H=8 actions: from a1 to a8.\n\n          But note: the answer format:\n\n            Turn t1: a_{t1}   -> Turn1: U\n            Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1} -> Turn2: U\n            ...\n            Turn t1+7: a_{t1+7} -> Turn8: U\n\n          However, we must check if at any turn we are on a dangerous freeway at a dangerous turn.\n\n          Let's check:\n\n            Turn1: we are at y1=1 (freeway1) -> safe (as computed).\n            Then we take U -> so at turn2 we are at y2=2 (freeway2).\n\n            Turn2: we are at freeway2 -> we must check: freeway2 at turn2: \n                freeway2: [-53+6*(2-1), -42+6*(2-1)] = [-53+6, -42+6] = [-47, -36] -> 0 not in the interval -> safe.\n\n            Turn3: we move to freeway3 -> same as freeway2 at turn3? \n                freeway3: same parameters -> [-53+6*(3-1), -42+6*(3-1)] = [-53+12, -42+12] = [-41, -30] -> safe.\n\n            Turn4: freeway4: same -> [-53+6*3, -42+6*3] = [-53+18, -42+18] = [-35, -24] -> safe.\n\n            Turn5: freeway5: same -> [-53+24, -42+24] = [-29, -18] -> safe.\n\n            Turn6: freeway6: at turn6: \n                freeway6: [-47+36*(6-1), -12+36*(6-1)] = [-47+180, -12+180] = [133,168] -> safe.\n\n            Turn7: freeway7: at turn7: \n                freeway7: [-47+48*(7-1), 0+48*(7-1)] = [-47+288, 288] = [241, 288] -> safe.\n\n            Turn8: freeway8: at turn8: [ -47+48*7, 48*7 ] = [-47+336, 336] = [289,336] -> safe.\n\n          Then we move to y9 at turn9 -> safe.\n\n          So the plan is valid.\n\n          But wait: what about freeway6 at turn2? We were not on freeway6 at turn2. We were on freeway2 at turn2 -> safe.\n\n          Therefore, minimal H is 8? \n\n          However, is there a faster way? We cannot jump over freeways. We must go through each freeway? \n\n          Actually, we can only change by 1 per turn. So the minimal number of moves is 8 (from y1 to y9: 8 steps up). \n\n          So we cannot do it in less than 8 actions.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is 8 actions: all U.\n\n          But note: we could consider moving faster by staying? No, staying would not help because we need to move up 8 times.\n\n          Or we could move down? That would only make the path longer.\n\n        However, what if we try to avoid freeway6 at turn2 by not being on freeway6 at turn2? \n\n          But we are not going to be on freeway6 at turn2: we are going to freeway2 at turn2 -> safe.\n\n        Another potential problem: what if we get to freeway6 at a dangerous time? \n\n          We are going to freeway6 at turn6? and at turn6 freeway6 is safe.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, the sequence:\n\n          Turn1: U\n          Turn2: U\n          Turn3: U\n          Turn4: U\n          Turn5: U\n          Turn6: U\n          Turn7: U\n          Turn8: U\n\n        And we are done.\n\n        But wait: the problem says we start at (0,1) at turn1. After the first U, we are at turn2 at (0,2). Then at turn2, we are at freeway2 -> safe.\n\n        So let's write the answer:\n\n          Turn 1: U\n          Turn 2: U\n          Turn 3: U\n          Turn 4: U\n          Turn 5: U\n          Turn 6: U\n          Turn 7: U\n          Turn 8: U\n\n        But note: the answer format: \n\n          \\boxed{\n            Turn 1: a_{1}\n            Turn 2: a_{2}\n            ...\n          }\n\n        However, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" -> but H=8, so t from 0 to 7? \n\n        And t1=1, so the actions are at t1+0, t1+1, ... t1+7 -> which is turn1 to turn8.\n\n        So we write:\n\n          Turn 1: U\n          Turn 2: U\n          Turn 3: U\n          Turn 4: U\n          Turn 5: U\n          Turn 6: U\n          Turn 7: U\n          Turn 8: U\n\n        But wait: at turn8 we are at y8=8, and then we move to y9=9 at turn9. So we have reached the goal at turn9.\n\n        However, the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have taken 8 actions (so H=8) and we are at the goal at turn9? \n\n        The problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\n        And note: we are at (0,9) at the next turn after the last action. So the last action (at turn8) leads to y9 at turn9.\n\n        But the problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\" and the sequence is of length H. \n\n        And we are at the goal at the turn after the last action? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we are at the goal at turn t1+H? \n\n        But note: the update: \n            After H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1) we have done H steps? \n\n        Actually, the state at the beginning of turn t1 is given. Then we take the first action at turn t1, which leads to state at turn t1+1. Then ... the last action at turn t1+H-1 leads to state at turn t1+H.\n\n        We want the state at turn t1+H to be (0,9).\n\n        So we are at the goal at turn t1+H = 1+H.\n\n        We set 1+H = 9 -> H=8.\n\n        Therefore, the sequence has 8 actions.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" -> H is the number of turns? \n\n        Actually, we are using H to denote the number of actions? But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence covers H actions? \n\n        And the time span: from turn1 to turn1+H (which is 1+8=9) -> so we are at turn9.\n\n        So we output:\n\n          Turn 1: U\n          Turn 2: U\n          Turn 3: U\n          Turn 4: U\n          Turn 5: U\n          Turn 6: U\n          Turn 7: U\n          Turn 8: U\n\n        But wait: what if we can get there faster by skipping some freeways? We cannot: we can only move one step per turn.\n\n        Therefore, we have the answer.\n\n        However, let me double-check the freeway6 at turn6: we said it's safe. \n\n          At turn6: freeway6: \n            tau = -47, h=-12, s=36 -> \n            [ -47 + 36*(6-1), -12 + 36*(6-1) ] = [-47+180, -12+180] = [133,168] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n        And freeway7 at turn7: \n            tau=-47, h=0, s=48 -> \n            [ -47 + 48*(7-1), 0 + 48*(7-1) ] = [-47+288, 288] = [241,288] -> safe.\n\n        And freeway8 at turn8: \n            same as freeway7: [ -47+48*7, 48*7 ] = [-47+336,336] = [289,336] -> safe.\n\n        So it's safe.\n\n        However, note that freeway7 and freeway8 are dangerous at turn1, but we are not there at turn1.\n\n        One more: what if at turn2 we had been on freeway6? We avoided it by being on freeway2. But if we had gone to freeway6 at turn2, that would be dangerous? \n\n          But we didn't.\n\n        Therefore, the plan is safe.\n\n        But wait: what if we start by staying at turn1? Then at turn2 we are still at freeway1 -> safe. Then at turn2 we move to freeway2 -> safe. Then we continue. \n\n          Then we would be at turn2: y2=1 -> then turn3: y3=2, ... and so we would be at turn9: y9=8, and then turn10: y10=9. \n\n          That would be 9 actions -> H=9, which is worse.\n\n        So we don't do that.\n\n        Thus, the minimal H is 8.\n\n        However, note that the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have 8 actions, but we are at the goal at turn9. \n\n        The problem might be counting the turns including the starting turn? \n\n        But the problem says: \"current turn is t1\" and we start at t1=1. Then we take actions until we reach the goal.\n\n        The goal is reached at turn t1+H? \n\n        And we defined H as the number of actions. But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". \n\n        Let me read: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\".\n\n        So H is the number of actions? But note: the sequence has H actions, so H is the length of the sequence.\n\n        And the problem calls H the \"number of turns\", but in the context, it might be the number of actions we take (which are taken over H turns: from turn1 to turn1+H-1).\n\n        But the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" to reach (0,9). \n\n        And we reach (0,9) at turn1+H (after H actions). \n\n        So if we count the starting turn as turn1, then the total turns we use is H+1? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" to reach. \n\n        They might mean the total number of turns elapsed from the start until the goal? \n\n        Then we start at turn1 and reach at turn9 -> 9 turns? \n\n        But then H would be 9? \n\n        And we would have 9 actions? \n\n        But we only took 8 actions. \n\n        Alternatively, they might mean the number of actions (turns in which we take an action) is H.\n\n        The problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence has H actions. \n\n        So I think H is the number of actions.\n\n        And the goal is reached at the next turn (turn1+H). \n\n        Therefore, we output H=8 and the sequence of 8 U's.\n\n        But let me check the example: \n\n          Suppose we start at (0,1) at turn1. Then we do:\n\n            Turn1: U -> at turn2 we are at (0,2)\n            Turn2: U -> at turn3 at (0,3)\n            ... \n            Turn8: U -> at turn9 at (0,9)\n\n          So we have taken 8 turns (actions) and reached at turn9.\n\n        The problem: \"minimal number of turns H\" -> they might mean the minimal H such that we are at the goal at turn t1+H. \n\n        Then we are at the goal at turn1+H, so we want to minimize H? \n\n        But note: we start at turn1, and we want to be at the goal at turn1+H. \n\n        In our plan, we are at the goal at turn9 = 1+8 -> so H=8.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 8.\n\n        So we output 8 actions.\n\n        However, what if we can do it in fewer? \n\n          We start at y1=1. We need to get to y=9. The minimal number of moves is 8. So we cannot do it in fewer than 8 actions.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n          Turn 1: U\n          Turn 2: U\n          Turn 3: U\n          Turn 4: U\n          Turn 5: U\n          Turn 6: U\n          Turn 7: U\n          Turn 8: U\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\". We have determined H=8.\n\n        However, note that the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then we output the sequence.\n\n        But the answer format only shows the sequence? \n\n        The boxed part only has the actions per turn.\n\n        So we output:\n\n          \\boxed{\n            Turn 1: U\n            Turn 2: U\n            Turn 3: U\n            Turn 4: U\n            Turn 5: U\n            Turn 6: U\n            Turn 7: U\n            Turn 8: U\n          }\n\n        But note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" -> so we have t from 0 to 7? \n\n        But we write the turn labels as:\n\n          Turn 1: a_1\n          Turn 2: a_2\n          ...\n          Turn 8: a_8\n\n        Since t1=1, then the actions are for turns 1, 2, ... 8.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, wait: what if we are forced to wait at some point? \n\n        Consider freeway6: dangerous at turn2. What if we had to be on freeway6 at turn2? Then we would have to wait. But we are not on freeway6 at turn2.\n\n        Another potential issue: what if we start at freeway1 and then we move to freeway2 at turn2, but freeway2 becomes dangerous at turn2? \n\n          We computed freeway2 at turn2: [-47, -36] -> safe.\n\n        And we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, we are confident.\n\n        But note: the freeway6 is dangerous at turn2. What if we try to go up two freeways in one turn? We cannot.\n\n        So the above plan is the minimal and safe.\n\n        Let me check freeway7 and freeway8 again: they are dangerous at turn1, but we are at freeway1 at turn1 -> safe.\n\n        And then at turn2 we are at freeway2 -> safe.\n\n        Therefore, we output the sequence.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". \n\n        We have checked each freeway we are on at each turn: we are on freeway1 at turn1, freeway2 at turn2, ... freeway8 at turn8 -> all safe.\n\n        We are not on any freeway at turn9 (because we are at y=9) -> so no check at turn9.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is as above.\n\n        But wait: what about the car on freeway1 at turn1? \n\n          We are at freeway1 at turn1: \n            freeway1: [49+12*(1-1),60+12*(1-1)] = [49,60] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, we are done.\n\n        However, note that freeway7 and freeway8 have the same parameters? \n\n          k7: (0,-47,right,48) -> head=0, tail=-47, right, speed=48.\n          k8: (0,-47,right,48) -> same.\n\n        So both are dangerous only at turn1? \n\n          For turn T: \n              [ -47+48*(T-1), 0+48*(T-1) ]\n\n          At T=1: [-47,0] -> includes 0 -> dangerous.\n          At T=2: [1,48] -> safe.\n\n        So yes.\n\n        Therefore, the plan is safe.\n\n        Final answer:\n\n          Turn 1: U\n          Turn 2: U\n          Turn 3: U\n          Turn 4: U\n          Turn 5: U\n          Turn 6: U\n          Turn 7: U\n          Turn 8: U\n\n        But wait: we are at y=1 at turn1. After the first U, we go to y=2 at turn2. Then we are at freeway2 at turn2 -> safe.\n\n        Then we go to y=3 at turn3 -> freeway3 -> safe.\n\n        And so on.\n\n        So we write the answer.\n\n        However, the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=8. \n\n        But note: the problem might mean the total number of game turns (including the starting turn) until the goal? \n\n        Then we are at the goal at turn9, so 9 turns? \n\n        But the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence of actions is of length H. \n\n        And the goal is reached at the next turn after the last action.\n\n        The problem states: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" to reach (0,9). \n\n        So the goal is reached after the entire sequence is executed, which is at turn t1+H.\n\n        Therefore, H is the number of actions, and the total time is H+1? \n\n        But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", meaning the number of actions? \n\n        Since we have to take 8 actions, H=8.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might mean the total number of turns (including the starting turn) is H? \n\n        Then we start at turn1 and end at turn9 -> H=9? \n\n        But then the sequence of actions would be from turn1 to turn8 (8 actions). \n\n        The problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" -> if H=9, then the sequence would be for t=0 to 8 -> 9 actions? \n\n        But we only have 8 actions.\n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        Let me read the problem again: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\n        They say: the sequence is of length H? \n\n        Then we have:\n\n          t from 0 to H-1 -> that's H actions.\n\n        And we are at the goal at turn t1+H? \n\n        So the total time from the start (turn1) to the goal is H+1? \n\n        But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has H actions. \n\n        And we are at the goal at the next turn. \n\n        So I think they consider H as the number of actions (which corresponds to the number of turns in which we act). \n\n        Therefore, we output H=8 and the sequence of 8 U's.\n\n        But note: the answer format does not require us to output H explicitly, only the sequence with the turn labels.\n\n        So we write:\n\n          Turn 1: U\n          Turn 2: U\n          Turn 3: U\n          Turn 4: U\n          Turn 5: U\n          Turn 6: U\n          Turn 7: U\n          Turn 8: U\n\n        However, what if we can do it in 8 actions but with a different sequence? \n\n        For example, if we do a down move at some point, we might avoid a car but then we have to go up more -> which would take more than 8 actions. \n\n        So we cannot.\n\n        Therefore, we output the above.\n\n        But wait: what if we move up twice and then down once? Then we would have to do more moves to compensate. So it would be more than 8.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal is 8.\n\n        However, let me consider the possibility of avoiding the dangerous freeway2 at turn8 and turn9 by being there earlier? \n\n          But we are at freeway2 at turn2, which is safe. And we are not at freeway2 at turn8 or turn9.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, we are done.\n\n        One more: freeway3,4,5: dangerous at turn8 and turn9. But we are at freeway3 at turn3, freeway4 at turn4, freeway5 at turn5 -> safe at those turns.\n\n        So the plan is safe.\n\n        Final answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 1) on turn 1 and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8. The car states at turn 1 are:\n\n- Freeway 1: car spans [49, 60] (safe at turn 1)\n- Freeway 2: car spans [-53, -42] (dangerous at turns 8 and 9)\n- Freeway 3: car spans [-53, -42] (dangerous at turns 8 and 9)\n- Freeway 4: car spans [-53, -42] (dangerous at turns 8 and 9)\n- Freeway 5: car spans [-53, -42] (dangerous at turns 8 and 9)\n- Freeway 6: car spans [-47, -12] (dangerous at turn 2)\n- Freeway 7: car spans [-47, 0] (dangerous at turn 1)\n- Freeway 8: car spans [-47, 0] (dangerous at turn 1)\n\nThe player must move up (U) to increase the y-coordinate. The minimal path requires 8 moves (from y=1 to y=9). The sequence of actions is simulated:\n\n- **Turn 1**: Start at y=1 (freeway 1). Car on freeway 1 at turn 1: [49, 60], 0 not in span → safe. Action U moves to y=2 at turn 2.\n- **Turn 2**: Position y=2 (freeway 2). Car on freeway 2 at turn 2: [-53 + 6(1) = -47, -42 + 6(1) = -36] → [-47, -36], 0 not in span → safe. Action U moves to y=3 at turn 3.\n- **Turn 3**: Position y=3 (freeway 3). Car on freeway 3 at turn 3: [-53 + 6(2) = -41, -42 + 6(2) = -30] → [-41, -30], 0 not in span → safe. Action U moves to y=4 at turn 4.\n- **Turn 4**: Position y=4 (freeway 4). Car on freeway 4 at turn 4: [-53 + 6(3) = -35, -42 + 6(3) = -24] → [-35, -24], 0 not in span → safe. Action U moves to y=5 at turn 5.\n- **Turn 5**: Position y=5 (freeway 5). Car on freeway 5 at turn 5: [-53 + 6(4) = -29, -42 + 6(4) = -18] → [-29, -18], 0 not in span → safe. Action U moves to y=6 at turn 6.\n- **Turn 6**: Position y=6 (freeway 6). Car on freeway 6 at turn 6: [-47 + 36(5) = 133, -12 + 36(5) = 168] → [133, 168], 0 not in span → safe. Action U moves to y=7 at turn 7.\n- **Turn 7**: Position y=7 (freeway 7). Car on freeway 7 at turn 7: [-47 + 48(6) = 241, 0 + 48(6) = 288] → [241, 288], 0 not in span → safe. Action U moves to y=8 at turn 8.\n- **Turn 8**: Position y=8 (freeway 8). Car on freeway 8 at turn 8: [-47 + 48(7) = 289, 0 + 48(7) = 336] → [289, 336], 0 not in span → safe. Action U moves to y=9 at turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, the player reaches (0, 9), which is safe (no cars on y=9). The sequence uses 8 actions (turns 1 to 8) and achieves the goal in minimal turns. No shorter sequence is possible, as 8 moves are required to increase y from 1 to 9. Alternative sequences (e.g., including down or stay actions) would require more than 8 turns.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 1: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: U\n}",

I can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but I have to stay within 0 to 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at the turn I'm on a freeway, and for that freeway, the car's span includes 0 at that exact turn. Also, when I move to a new row, I'm not considered on that row until the next turn, so I only check the row I'm currently on for collision.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t=2, and I need to find where they are at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at t=2:\n\n- Freeway 1: head -48, tail -59, direction right, speed 12. Since it's right-moving, the span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? Let's see the notation.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 1: h = -48, τ = -59, d = right, s = 12.\n\nSince it's right-moving, the tail is at -59, head at -48, so the car is from x= -59 to x= -48, and it's moving right, so at time T, position will be [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-59 + 12(T-2), -48 + 12(T-2)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)], but here all cars seem to be right-moving.\n\nLet's check all:\n\nFreeway 1: d=right\n\nFreeway 2: d=right\n\nFreeway 3: d=right\n\nFreeway 4: d=right\n\nFreeway 5: d=right\n\nFreeway 6: h=24, τ=-11, d=right, s=36? τ=-11, h=24, but if it's right-moving, tail should be less than head, I think.\n\nh=24, τ=-11, so τ is tail, h is head, so if d=right, it should be that tail is left, head is right, so from x= -11 to x=24? But that seems odd because -11 is less than 24, so τ=-11, h=24, so the car spans from x= -11 to x=24, which is length 35, and moving right.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: h=48, τ=1, d=right, s=48. τ=1, h=48, so from 1 to 48.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, h=48, τ=1, d=right, s=48.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, I am on freeway k, and for that freeway, 0 is in the span at T.\n\nThat is, for freeway k at turn T, if min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nSince the span is a continuous interval.\n\nAlso, when I am at position (0, y_t) at turn t, I need that for freeway y_t, 0 not in the car span at turn t.\n\nIf I move to a new row, at the turn I move, I am still on the old row, so I only care about the row I'm on at the start of the turn.\n\nThe player update: at turn t, I choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAnd collision is checked at each turn based on y_t and the car on row y_t at turn t.\n\nThe note says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the row I'm on at turn T.\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", which means that at turn T, you are on y_T for collision check.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, at each turn t, I am on row y_t, and I need that for that row, the car span at time t does not contain 0.\n\nIf I stay or move, at turn t, position is (0, y_t), and collision depends on y_t and time t.\n\nNow, I start at t=2, y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible, so I want to go up as much as possible, but I have to avoid the cars when they are at x=0.\n\nFirst, I need to find for each freeway, when the car spans contain 0.\n\nFor each freeway k, and for each time t, I need to know if 0 is in the span at time t.\n\nBut t starts from 2 onwards.\n\nSince the cars are moving, I can find the times when the car covers x=0.\n\nFor a right-moving car, span at time t is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)]\n\nSet t1 = 2.\n\nSo, for freeway k, span at t is [τ_k + s_k (t - 2), h_k + s_k (t - 2)] for right-moving.\n\n0 is in span if τ_k + s_k (t - 2) <= 0 <= h_k + s_k (t - 2)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right here.\n\nSo, let's list for each freeway the times when 0 is covered.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: τ = -59, h = -48, s = 12, d=right\n\nSpan at t: [-59 + 12(t-2), -48 + 12(t-2)]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 12(t-2) <= 0 <= -48 + 12(t-2)\n\nSolve inequalities:\n\nLeft: -59 + 12(t-2) <= 0 => 12(t-2) <= 59 => t-2 <= 59/12 = 4.916... so t-2 <= 4 since t integer? t-2 <= floor(59/12)? Better to keep fractional.\n\n59/12 = 4.916, so t-2 <= 4.916, so t-2 <= 4 since t integer? Inequality.\n\n-59 + 12(t-2) <= 0 => 12(t-2) <= 59 => t-2 <= 59/12 = 4 + 11/12, so t-2 <= 4.916, since t integer, t-2 <= 4? No.\n\nt-2 <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so for integer t, t-2 <= 4? t-2 can be 0,1,2,3,4,5? Let's see.\n\n12(t-2) <= 59, so t-2 <= 59/12 = 4.916, so t-2 <= 4 because 5>4.916? 4.916, t-2 <= 4.916, so t-2 <= 4 since t integer? t-2 can be 5? 12*5=60>59, so 12(t-2) <=59, if t-2=4, 12*4=48<=59, true; t-2=5, 60>59, false. So t-2 <=4? 48<=59 true, but let's write.\n\n12(t-2) <=59, so t-2 <= floor(59/12) =4 since 12*4=48<59, 12*5=60>59. But inequality: 12(t-2) <=59, so for t-2=4, 48<=59 true; t-2=5,60>59 false. But this is for the left bound.\n\nSimilarly, right bound: 0 <= -48 + 12(t-2) => 48 <= 12(t-2) => 12(t-2) >=48 => t-2 >=4.\n\nSo for freeway 1:\n\n0 in span if:\n\n-59 +12(t-2) <= 0 and 0 <= -48 +12(t-2)\n\nWhich is:\n\n12(t-2) <=59 and 12(t-2) >=48\n\nFrom left: 12(t-2) <=59\n\nFrom right: 12(t-2) >=48\n\nSo 48 <= 12(t-2) <=59\n\nDivide by 12: 4 <= (t-2) <= 59/12 = 4.916...\n\nSince t integer, t-2 =4 or t-2=5? 4 <= t-2 <= 4.916, so t-2 =4 only? t-2=4: 12*4=48 >=48 and <=59, true.\n\nt-2=5: 12*5=60, 60 >=48 true, but 60 <=59? 60>59, false, so only t-2=4.\n\nt-2=4: 48 <=48<=59, yes.\n\nt-2=3: 12*3=36, 36 <48, not >=48, so no.\n\nt-2=5: 60>59, not <=59, so no.\n\nSo only at t-2=4, i.e., t=6.\n\nt=2 +4 =6.\n\nSo for freeway 1, 0 is covered only at t=6.\n\nNow freeway 2: τ = -36, h = -47? Wait no.\n\nFreeway 2: cars (head h, tail τ, ...) h=-36, τ=-47? The table says: (-36, -47, right, 6)\n\nSo head h=-36, tail τ=-47.\n\nSince right-moving, tail should be left, so τ=-47, h=-36, so from x=-47 to x=-36.\n\nDirection right, speed 6.\n\nSpan at t: [τ + s(t-2), h + s(t-2)] = [-47 + 6(t-2), -36 + 6(t-2)]\n\n0 in span if -47 +6(t-2) <= 0 <= -36 +6(t-2)\n\nLeft: -47 +6(t-2) <=0 => 6(t-2) <=47 => t-2 <= 47/6 ≈7.833, so t-2 <=7 since integer? Wait.\n\n6(t-2) <=47, t-2 <= floor(47/6)=7.833, so t-2 <=7? 6*7=42<=47, 6*8=48>47, so t-2 <=7 for <=47? 42<=47 true, but inequality.\n\n-47 +6(t-2) <=0 => 6(t-2) <=47, so t-2 <= 47/6 ≈7.833, so for integer t, t-2 <=7 because 7<=7.833, 8>7.833.\n\nt-2 min is 0, max whatever.\n\nSimilarly, right: 0 <= -36 +6(t-2) => 36 <=6(t-2) => 6(t-2) >=36 => t-2 >=6.\n\nSo 6 <= t-2 <= 7.833? From left: t-2 <= floor(47/6) but 47/6=7.833, so t-2 <=7\n\nFrom right: t-2 >= ceil(36/6)=6\n\nSo t-2 >=6 and t-2 <=7\n\nSo t-2 =6 or 7\n\nt-2=6: span left: -47+36= -11 <=0, right: -36+36=0 <=0? 0<=0 true.\n\n-36 +6*6 = -36+36=0, so 0<=0 true.\n\nt-2=7: left: -47+42= -5 <=0 true, right: -36+42=6 >=0, 0<=6 true.\n\nt-2=5: left: -47+30= -17<=0 true, but right: -36+30= -6 <=0, but 0 <= -6? 0 <= -6 false, so not satisfied.\n\nSimilarly t-2=8: left: -47+48=1 <=0? 1<=0 false.\n\nSo for freeway 2, 0 covered at t=2+6=8 and t=2+7=9? t-2=6 and 7, so t=8 and t=9.\n\nt=2 + (t-2), so t=8 and t=9.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? The table says for freeway 3: (-36, -47, right, 6) same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 3: (-36, -47, right, 6) identical to freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same (-36, -47, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 5: same (-36, -47, right, 6)\n\nAll freeways 2,3,4,5 have the same car? But they are different freeways, but same car parameters.\n\nFreeway 1 is different, freeway 6,7,8 different.\n\nFor collision, since each freeway has its own car, but for freeways 2,3,4,5, the cars are identical, so for each, 0 is covered at the same times, t=8 and t=9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: head h=24, tail τ=-11, direction right, speed 36.\n\nSpan at t: [τ + s(t-2), h + s(t-2)] = [-11 + 36(t-2), 24 + 36(t-2)]\n\n0 in span if -11 +36(t-2) <=0 <= 24 +36(t-2)\n\nLeft: -11 +36(t-2) <=0 => 36(t-2) <=11 => t-2 <= 11/36 ≈0.305, so t-2 <=0 since integer? t-2 <= floor(11/36)=0? 11/36<1, so t-2 <=0\n\nRight: 0 <=24 +36(t-2) => 0 <=24 +36(t-2), which is always true since 24>0 and t-2>=0, so for t>=2, right bound always true.\n\nBut left: -11 +36(t-2) <=0 => 36(t-2) <=11 => t-2 <= 11/36 <1, so for integer t>=2, t-2 >=0, so 36(t-2) >=0 > -11? The inequality is <=0 for left, but let's see.\n\n-11 +36(t-2) <=0 => 36(t-2) <=11\n\nFor t=2, t-2=0, 36*0=0 <=11 true, so left true.\n\nAt t=2, left: -11 +0 = -11 <=0 true, right: 24 +0=24 >=0 true, so 0 in span at t=2.\n\nBut t=2 is the current turn, and I am on y=2, not on freeway 6, so for freeway 6, at t=2, it is covered, but since I am not on that row, no collision for me.\n\nNow for t>2, t-2>=1, 36(t-2) >=36 >11, so 36(t-2) >11, thus -11 +36(t-2) >0, so left bound not satisfied for t>2.\n\nFor example t=3, t-2=1, span left: -11+36=25>0, so 0 not <=25? 0 <=25 true, but the condition is left <=0 <= right.\n\nLeft: -11 +36(t-2), at t=3, left=25, 25 <=0? False, so 0 not in span because left >0.\n\nSimilarly, for t=2, left=-11<=0, right=24>=0, so 0 in span.\n\nt=3, left=25>0, so 0 < left, not in span.\n\nSimilarly for later t.\n\nSo for freeway 6, 0 covered only at t=2.\n\nNow freeway 7: h=48, τ=1, d=right, s=48.\n\nτ=1, h=48, so from 1 to 48, moving right.\n\nSpan at t: [τ + s(t-2), h + s(t-2)] = [1 + 48(t-2), 48 + 48(t-2)]\n\n0 in span if 1 +48(t-2) <=0 <= 48 +48(t-2)\n\nLeft: 1 +48(t-2) <=0 => 48(t-2) <= -1, since t>=2, t-2>=0, 48(t-2) >=0, so 48(t-2) <= -1 is impossible. Always false.\n\nRight: 0 <=48 +48(t-2) always true since t-2>=0.\n\nSo left bound never <=0, so 0 never in span for freeway 7.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as 7, h=48, τ=1, right, s=48, so same, 0 never in span.\n\nNow freeway 1: only at t=6\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5: at t=8 and t=9\n\nFreeway 6: at t=2 only\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: never\n\nI start at t=2, y=2. At t=2, for freeway 2, which is y=2, I need to check if there is collision.\n\nAt t=2, freeway 2 car: as above, for freeway 2 at t=2.\n\nFreeway 2: span at t=2: τ + s(0) = -47, h + s(0) = -36, so span [-47,-36], 0 not in this, since -36 <0? -36 to -47, min -47, max -36, both negative, so 0 not in [-47,-36], so no collision at t=2 on y=2.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=2 to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, no car, so safe.\n\nThe path is through rows y=3 to y=8, but I can move up, down, or stay.\n\nSince I want to minimize turns, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid being on a row when 0 is covered.\n\nAlso, I can stay or move down to avoid, but since I need to go to 9, moving down might not help, but I could wait.\n\nBut to minimize H, I should not stay if possible.\n\nNow, let's list the dangerous times for each row.\n\nRow 1: freeway 1, dangerous at t=6\n\nRow 2: freeway 2, dangerous at t=8 and t=9\n\nBut row 2 has freeway 2, which is dangerous at t=8,9.\n\nSimilarly, row 3: freeway 3, same as row 2, dangerous at t=8 and t=9\n\nRow 4: freeway 4, same, t=8,9\n\nRow 5: freeway 5, same, t=8,9\n\nRow 6: freeway 6, dangerous only at t=2\n\nBut t=2 is past, and at t=2, row 6 was dangerous, but I wasn't there.\n\nFor t>2, row 6 is safe, since only t=2 was dangerous.\n\nRow 7: freeway 7, never dangerous\n\nRow 8: freeway 8, never dangerous\n\nRow 9: no car, safe.\n\nNow, I start at t=2, y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe obstacles are: row 1 dangerous at t=6; rows 2,3,4,5 dangerous at t=8 and t=9; row 6 safe for t>2; rows 7,8,9 safe.\n\nSince I start at y=2, and want to go to y=9, the minimal number of moves is 7 moves up, so H=7, from t=2 to t=8, y from 2 to 9.\n\nBut at t=8, if I am on rows 2,3,4, or 5, it would be dangerous, but at t=8, if I am on y=9, it should be fine.\n\nLet's see the timing.\n\nSuppose I go up every turn.\n\nStart t=2, y=2. Safe, as we saw.\n\nAction at t=2: U, then y=3 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, I am on y=3? At turn t, position y_t.\n\nt=2, y=2.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nAt turn t, I am on y_t.\n\nI choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is for next turn.\n\nFor collision at turn t, it depends on y_t and time t.\n\nSo, at t=2, y=2, row 2 is safe at t=2, as above.\n\nI choose a_2, say U, then y_3 = 3.\n\nAt t=3, I am on y=3, need to check row 3 at t=3.\n\nRow 3: freeway 3, dangerous only at t=8 and t=9, so at t=3, safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go U again, a_3=U, y_4=4 at t=4.\n\nt=4, on y=4, row 4 dangerous at t=8,9 only, so safe.\n\na_4=U, y_5=5 at t=5.\n\nt=5, on y=5, safe, since dangerous only t=8,9.\n\na_5=U, y_6=6 at t=6.\n\nNow t=6, on y=6.\n\nRow 6: freeway 6, dangerous only at t=2, so for t=6, safe. Since t=2 was only danger.\n\nSo safe.\n\na_6=U, y_7=7 at t=7.\n\nt=7, on y=7, row 7 never dangerous, safe.\n\na_7=U, y_8=8 at t=8.\n\nt=8, on y=8, row 8 never dangerous, safe.\n\na_8=U, y_9=9 at t=9.\n\nNow at t=9, I am on y=9, which is safe, no car.\n\nBut I reached y=9 at t=9, so after 7 actions: from t=2 to t=8 actions, y from 2 to 9 in 7 steps.\n\nH is the number of turns? The sequence is from t=0 to H-1, but here t starts from t1=2.\n\nThe player position is at turn t, so at turn t=2, I start, after H turns, I am at turn t=2+H-1? Let's see.\n\nI start at turn t=2, position y=2.\n\nAfter one action, at turn t=3, position y_3.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t=2+k, position y_{2+k}.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn T.\n\nThen H = T - t1? The minimal H such that at turn t1 + H - 1, y=9.\n\nt1=2.\n\nSo at turn 2 + H - 1, y=9.\n\nFor example, if I go directly up, as above:\n\nt=2: y=2\n\nt=3: y=3 (after a_2=U)\n\nt=4: y=4 (a_3=U)\n\nt=5: y=5 (a_4=U)\n\nt=6: y=6 (a_5=U)\n\nt=7: y=7 (a_6=U)\n\nt=8: y=8 (a_7=U)\n\nt=9: y=9 (a_8=U)\n\nSo at turn t=9, y=9.\n\nNow t = t1 + H - 1 = 2 + H -1 = 9, so 2+H-1=9, H-1=7, H=8.\n\nt1 + H -1 =9, t1=2, so 2 + H -1 =9, thus H-1=7, H=8.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, actions at t=2 to t=9? Let's list the turns.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at time t1 + t for t=0,1,2,...,H-1.\n\nThen after H actions, at time t1 + H, position is updated, but the turn when we are at position is t1 + H.\n\nThe position after action is at the next turn.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn T, we need that from the actions, we reach y=9 at turn T.\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, we are at turn t1 + H.\n\nStart: turn t1=2, y=2.\n\nAfter first action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1=3, y_{3}.\n\nAfter second action a_{t1+1}, at turn t1+2=4, y_4.\n\n...\n\nAfter k-th action, at turn t1 + k, y_{t1+k}.\n\nTo have y_{t1+k} =9 for some k.\n\nThen H = k, the number of actions.\n\nAnd the turn is t1 + H.\n\nIn the answer, we list actions from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, in direct up: to reach y=9 at turn 9, we need actions from t=2 to t=8, that's 7 actions? t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8: 7 actions, then at turn 9, y=9.\n\nt=2: action a2, to y3 at t=3\n\n...\n\nt=8: action a8, to y9 at t=9.\n\nSo actions at t=2 to t=8, that's 7 actions, H=7.\n\nThen turn t= t1 + H -1? t1=2, H=7, t1+H-1=2+7-1=8, and at t=8 we do action to go to y9 at t=9.\n\nBut we reach y9 at t=9, which is after H actions.\n\nIn terms of the position at turn: at turn T, y_T.\n\nWe start with y_{t1} given.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nThe actions are applied at turns t1 to t1+H-1, resulting in y_{t1+1} to y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nSo for y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nH is the number of turns from start to reach.\n\nIn this case, with direct up, y9 at t=9, t1=2, so t1+H=9, H=7.\n\nActions at t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8: all U.\n\nNow, in this path, at each turn, was it safe?\n\nt=2: y=2, row2 safe at t=2 (as dangerous only t8,9)\n\nt=3: y=3, row3 safe at t=3\n\nt=4: y=4, row4 safe\n\nt=5: y=5, row5 safe\n\nt=6: y=6, row6 safe at t=6 (danger only t=2)\n\nt=7: y=7, row7 safe always\n\nt=8: y=8, row8 safe always\n\nThen at t=9, y=9, safe.\n\nSo all safe, and H=7.\n\nBut is there a problem? At t=8, rows 2-5 are dangerous, but I am on y=8, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut can I reach faster? To reach y=9 earlier.\n\nMinimal H: since I need to go from y=2 to y=9, delta y=7, so at least 7 moves up, so minimal H is 7, achieved here.\n\nBut in this case, it seems possible with H=7.\n\nBut let me confirm the dangerous times.\n\nAt t=6, I am on y=6, row6: freeway6, which was dangerous only at t=2, so at t=6, span: for row6, at t=6, s=36, t-2=4, span: [-11 +36*4, 24 +36*4] = [-11+144, 24+144] = [133,168], all positive, not covering 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, rows 2-5 at t=6: for example row2, at t=6, t-2=4, span: [-47 +6*4, -36 +6*4] = [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12], negative, not cover 0, safe.\n\nOnly dangerous at t=8 and t=9 for them.\n\nt=8: row2 span: [-47 +6*6, -36+6*6]? t-2=6 for t=8, since t1=2.\n\nt=8, t-2=6, span: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], so -11<=0<=0? 0<=0 true, so yes, 0 covered.\n\nSimilarly t=9: t-2=7, [-47+42, -36+42]=[-5,6], 0 covered.\n\nBut in my path, at t=8, I am on y=8, not on rows 2-5.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which I do at t=9.\n\nIs there a way with H=6? That would require reaching y=9 at t=8.\n\nt1=2, if H=6, then at turn t1+H = 2+6=8, y=9.\n\nSo actions from t=2 to t=7 (since actions at t=2 to t=7, then y8=9).\n\nBut from y=2 to y=9 in 6 actions, I need to go up 7 times? Each action U increases y by 1, so to increase y by 7, I need at least 7 U actions, so cannot in 6 actions; I need at least 7 actions.\n\nWith H actions, I can have at most H up moves, but since I start at y=2, need to reach y=9, difference 7, so H >=7.\n\nMinimal H is 7.\n\nAnd in this case, it works with all U, no problem.\n\nBut why do I think there might be an issue? Oh, row1 dangerous at t=6, but in my path, I am never on row1, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other rows are safe when I pass.\n\nBut in the path, at t=6, I am on y=6, not row1.\n\nRow1 is y=1, I start from y=2 and go up, so I never go to y=1, so row1 danger is irrelevant.\n\nSimilarly, I avoid rows 2-5 at t=8 and t=9, but since I am at y=8 at t=8 and y=9 at t=9, I am not on those rows at dangerous times.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut the car on row6 at t=2 was dangerous, but t=2 is past, and I was on y=2, not y=6.\n\nSo with all U actions, I can reach in H=7 turns.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence.\n\nBut let me list the actions.\n\nTurn t1=2: a_2 = U\n\nTurn t1+1=3: a_3 = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t1+6=8: a_8 = U? t from 0 to H-1.\n\nH=7, t from 0 to 6.\n\nAction at t1 + t for t=0 to 6.\n\nt=0: t1+0=2, a2\n\nt=1: t1+1=3, a3\n\n...\n\nt=6: t1+6=8, a8\n\nAll U.\n\nThen at turn 9, y=9.\n\nBut the sequence is for turns starting from t1.\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nBut is there a reason to not go directly? For example, if at some point I need to avoid.\n\nBut in this case, it seems possible.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I can be faster, but I cannot, since minimal 7 moves.\n\nMaybe with down moves, but that would take more turns, so worse.\n\nSo H=7 should be minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbers.\n\nStart: turn 2, y=2\n\nAfter a2=U, turn 3, y=3\n\na3=U, turn 4, y=4\n\na4=U, turn 5, y=5\n\na5=U, turn 6, y=6\n\na6=U, turn 7, y=7\n\na7=U, turn 8, y=8\n\na8=U, turn 9, y=9\n\nActions at turn 2,3,4,5,6,7,8: that's 7 actions.\n\nH=7.\n\nNow, collision check:\n\nAt turn 2: y=2, row2 car: at t=2, span [-47,-36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 3: y=3, row3 car: same as row2, at t=3, t-2=1, span [-47+6, -36+6]=[-41,-30], not cover 0, safe.\n\nTurn 4: y=4, row4 car: at t=4, t-2=2, span [-47+12, -36+12]=[-35,-24], safe.\n\nTurn 5: y=5, row5 car: at t=5, t-2=3, span [-47+18, -36+18]=[-29,-18], safe.\n\nTurn 6: y=6, row6 car: at t=6, t-2=4, span [-11+144, 24+144]=[133,168], not 0, safe.\n\nTurn 7: y=7, row7 car: never dangerous, or at t=7, span [1 +48*5, 48+48*5]=[1+240,48+240]=[241,288], not 0, safe.\n\nTurn 8: y=8, row8 car: similar, [1+48*6,48+48*6]=[1+288,48+288]=[289,336], safe.\n\nTurn 9: y=9, no car, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and in this case H=7.\n\nBut is there a constraint I missed?\n\nAnother thing: the car on row1 at t=6, but I didn't go there.\n\nPerhaps if I had to go through, but I don't.\n\nMaybe for row6, but at t=6 it was safe.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I can reach in less, but impossible.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut let me see the car for row6: at t=2, it was dangerous, but I wasn't there.\n\nIn the sequence, all U should work.\n\nBut the answer format is to list the actions.\n\nSo for H=7, actions all U.\n\nBut let me write the sequence.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} = U\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 + 6: a_{t_1 + 6} = U\n\nSince H=7, t from 0 to 6, so turns t1 to t1+6.\n\nt1=2, so turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nEach with action U.\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nBut perhaps I need to specify.\n\nMaybe I should consider if at some point I need to stay or something, but here not.\n\nAnother thought: at t=8 and t=9, rows 2-5 are dangerous, but since I am above, no issue.\n\nSuppose I go slower, but that would take more turns, worse.\n\nSo minimal H=7 with all up.\n\nBut let me confirm if row1 is a problem or something.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to y=9 faster, but no.\n\nAnother thing: the player can only move to adjacent rows, so I have to go through each, no jumping.\n\nSo yes.\n\nPerhaps I can move down to avoid, but unnecessary and costly.\n\nSo I think this is the solution.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars\", and in this path, no collision.\n\nSo the minimal H is 7.\n\nBut let me see the car states again.\n\nFreeway 6: at t=2, it was dangerous, but I wasn't there.\n\nFor freeway 6, it says (24, -11, right, 36), head 24, tail -11, so at t=2, span [-11,24], which includes 0, yes dangerous at t=2.\n\nBut at t=6, as above, not.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps I should list the dangerous times for clarity.\n\nRow y=1: dangerous only at t=6\n\ny=2: dangerous at t=8,9\n\ny=3: same, t=8,9\n\ny=4: same\n\ny=5: same\n\ny=6: dangerous only at t=2\n\ny=7: never\n\ny=8: never\n\ny=9: safe\n\nI start at y=2, t=2, safe.\n\nThen I can go up each turn, and since I pass y=6 at t=6, which is safe, and others are safe at the times I pass.\n\nAt t=8, I am at y=8, not on y=2-5.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 7 turns.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 2: U \\\\ Turn 3: U \\\\ Turn 4: U \\\\ Turn 5: U \\\\ Turn 6: U \\\\ Turn 7: U \\\\ Turn 8: U }\n\nWith H=7.\n\nBut in the box, it should be written as per format.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H is 7.\n\nBut let me see if H can be less? No.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at t=8 with y=9, but to have y=9 at t=8, I need to start from y=2 at t=2, so in 6 turns, but each turn I can increase y by at most 1, so from 2 to 9, 7 increases, so minimum 7 turns, so at t=9, y=9 is earliest.\n\nIf I could increase by more, but no, only +1 per U.\n\nSo H=7 is minimal.\n\nThus, the sequence is all U.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs only if, at turn \\(T\\), the player is on freeway \\(y_T\\) and the car span on that freeway contains \\(x = 0\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Movements and Dangerous Times\nThe car positions and movements are analyzed based on their initial state at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\). For each freeway, the times when \\(x = 0\\) is within the car span (i.e., dangerous times) are determined:\n\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Car \\((-48, -59, \\text{right}, 12)\\)  \n  Span at turn \\(T\\): \\([-59 + 12(T-2), -48 + 12(T-2)]\\)  \n  Dangerous when \\(-59 + 12(T-2) \\leq 0 \\leq -48 + 12(T-2)\\), which simplifies to \\(T = 6\\).  \n  Thus, dangerous only at **turn 6**.\n\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Car \\((-36, -47, \\text{right}, 6)\\)  \n  Span at turn \\(T\\): \\([-47 + 6(T-2), -36 + 6(T-2)]\\)  \n  Dangerous when \\(-47 + 6(T-2) \\leq 0 \\leq -36 + 6(T-2)\\), which simplifies to \\(T = 8\\) or \\(T = 9\\).  \n  Thus, dangerous at **turns 8 and 9**.\n\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Car \\((-36, -47, \\text{right}, 6)\\) (identical to Freeway 2)  \n  Dangerous at **turns 8 and 9**.\n\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Car \\((-36, -47, \\text{right}, 6)\\) (identical to Freeway 2)  \n  Dangerous at **turns 8 and 9**.\n\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Car \\((-36, -47, \\text{right}, 6)\\) (identical to Freeway 2)  \n  Dangerous at **turns 8 and 9**.\n\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Car \\((24, -11, \\text{right}, 36)\\)  \n  Span at turn \\(T\\): \\([-11 + 36(T-2), 24 + 36(T-2)]\\)  \n  Dangerous when \\(-11 + 36(T-2) \\leq 0 \\leq 24 + 36(T-2)\\).  \n  At \\(T=2\\), the span is \\([-11, 24]\\), which contains 0 (dangerous). For \\(T > 2\\), the left bound is positive, so 0 is not contained.  \n  Thus, dangerous only at **turn 2**.\n\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Car \\((48, 1, \\text{right}, 48)\\)  \n  Span at turn \\(T\\): \\([1 + 48(T-2), 48 + 48(T-2)]\\)  \n  The left bound \\(1 + 48(T-2) > 0\\) for all \\(T \\geq 2\\), so 0 is never contained.  \n  Thus, **never dangerous**.\n\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Car \\((48, 1, \\text{right}, 48)\\) (identical to Freeway 7)  \n  **Never dangerous**.\n\n- **Freeway 9 (y=9)**: No cars, always safe.\n\nSummary of dangerous times:\n- y=1: Dangerous at turn 6\n- y=2,3,4,5: Dangerous at turns 8 and 9\n- y=6: Dangerous only at turn 2 (safe for \\(T > 2\\))\n- y=7,8,9: Always safe\n\n### Path to Minimize Turns\nThe player starts at (0, 2) at turn 2 and must reach (0, 9). The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is determined by the vertical distance: from y=2 to y=9 requires a net increase of 7 units. Since each \"U\" action increases y by 1, and no action increases y by more than 1, at least 7 actions are needed. Thus, the minimal \\(H\\) is 7, reaching y=9 at turn 9.\n\nA sequence of 7 \"U\" actions (up) is feasible:\n- Start at turn 2, y=2 (safe, as y=2 is not dangerous at turn 2).\n- After each \"U\" action, y increases by 1 each turn.\n- The path is: y=2 (turn 2) → y=3 (turn 3) → y=4 (turn 4) → y=5 (turn 5) → y=6 (turn 6) → y=7 (turn 7) → y=8 (turn 8) → y=9 (turn 9).\n\nCollision checks at each turn:\n- Turn 2 (y=2): Freeway 2 span \\([-47, -36]\\) at T=2, 0 not in span → safe.\n- Turn 3 (y=3): Freeway 3 span \\([-47 + 6(1) = -41, -36 + 6(1) = -30]\\) at T=3, 0 not in span → safe.\n- Turn 4 (y=4): Freeway 4 span \\([-47 + 6(2) = -35, -36 + 6(2) = -24]\\) at T=4, 0 not in span → safe.\n- Turn 5 (y=5): Freeway 5 span \\([-47 + 6(3) = -29, -36 + 6(3) = -18]\\) at T=5, 0 not in span → safe.\n- Turn 6 (y=6): Freeway 6 span \\([-11 + 36(4) = 133, 24 + 36(4) = 168]\\) at T=6, 0 not in span → safe (dangerous only at T=2).\n- Turn 7 (y=7): Freeway 7 span \\([1 + 48(5) = 241, 48 + 48(5) = 288]\\) at T=7, 0 not in span → safe.\n- Turn 8 (y=8): Freeway 8 span \\([1 + 48(6) = 289, 48 + 48(6) = 336]\\) at T=8, 0 not in span → safe.\n- Turn 9 (y=9): No cars → safe.\n\nThis sequence avoids all dangerous times and reaches (0, 9) in 7 turns. No shorter sequence is possible due to the vertical distance constraint.\n\n### Sequence of Actions\n- Actions are applied at turns \\(t_1 + t\\) for \\(t = 0\\) to \\(H-1 = 6\\), i.e., turns 2 to 8.\n- All actions are \"U\" (up).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 2: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ } U }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 3, and the player is at (0,3). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nImportant: The player can only move vertically (U, D, S) and the horizontal position is fixed at 0. The cars are moving horizontally on their freeways (y=1 to 8). Collision occurs at turn T if the player is at freeway y at turn T and at that same turn T, there is a car on freeway y such that the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the player's x-coordinate).\n\nNote: When the player moves from freeway y to freeway y' at turn T, then at turn T the player is still on freeway y, and at turn T+1 the player will be on freeway y'. Therefore, at the moment of moving (the turn when the action is taken), the player is only on one freeway.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1=3. For each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed). Note that for left-moving cars, the head is the leftmost part? But in the update rule:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  This implies that for a left-moving car, the head is the leading part? Actually, note that in the update, the entire car moves left by s per turn. So if the car is moving left, then at turn T, the head (which was h at t1) becomes h - s*(T-t1). Similarly, the tail becomes τ - s*(T-t1). So the span is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. But note that if the car is moving left, then the head should be the rightmost part? Because the car is moving left, so the front is the leftmost? Actually, the problem states:\n\n  - Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] and then it moves left. But in the example, we have only right-moving cars. So let's focus on right-moving.\n\nFor right-moving cars:\n  Span(t1) = [τ, h] → becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\nThis means that at turn t1, the car occupies from τ to h (with τ < h, because it's moving right and the head is the front). Then at turn T, it moves right by s*(T-t1) so the new span is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nTherefore, for a car on freeway k, we have at turn T (relative to t1=3, so T = 3 + t, where t>=0):\n\n  For a right-moving car: \n      head_T = head_0 + s * (T - 3)\n      tail_T = tail_0 + s * (T - 3)\n\n  And the span is [tail_T, head_T] (and note tail_0 <= head_0, so tail_T <= head_T).\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is at freeway k at turn T and 0 is in [tail_T, head_T].\n\nWe start at turn 3 at y=3. We want to go to y=9. We can move up, down, or stay. The grid is from y=0 to y=9. We must avoid the freeways y=1 to 8 when there is a car that covers 0 at the same turn.\n\nNote: The player's movement is sequential. We need to output a sequence of actions starting at turn t1=3.\n\nGiven cars:\n\nFreeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 12) -> wait, note: head=-36, tail=-47? But for right-moving, the span is [τ, h] = [-47, -36]. So tail=-47, head=-36. Then at turn T, the span is [-47 + 12*(T-3), -36 + 12*(T-3)].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-30, -41, right, 6) -> span at t1=3: [-41, -30], then at T: [-41+6*(T-3), -30+6*(T-3)]\n\nFreeways 3,4,5: same as freeway 2? \n\nFreeway 6: (60,25,right,36) -> wait, head=60, tail=25? Then at t1=3, the span is [25,60]? But the problem says for right-moving: [τ, h] and in the input it's given as (head, tail, ...). So let me check the input: \n\n  | 6 | (60, 25, right, 36) | \n\nBut in the right-moving update, the initial span is [τ, h] meaning [tail, head]. So if they give (head, tail) then we have to interpret: head=60, tail=25 -> so the car is from 25 to 60? That would be a very long car (36 units) and moving right at speed 36. Then at turn T: [25+36*(T-3), 60+36*(T-3)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 and 8: (96,49,right,48) -> [49,96] at t1=3, then [49+48*(T-3), 96+48*(T-3)]\n\nBut note: the car on freeway 1: head=-36, tail=-47 -> so the car is from -47 to -36 (length 11) and moving right at 12. Similarly, freeway 2: from -41 to -30 (length 11) at speed 6.\n\nWe are at turn 3, and we are at y=3. We need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) to get to y=9 without colliding.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0.\n\nWe are going to simulate the future turns. We start at y=3 at turn 3. We want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible. The minimal number of moves if there were no cars would be 6 moves (all U: 3->4->5->6->7->8->9). But we have to avoid the cars.\n\nNote: We can also go down, but that would take more moves. So we try to go up as much as possible.\n\nWe must check for each freeway k and for each future turn T whether the car on freeway k (if it exists) will cover 0 at turn T.\n\nWe note that the cars are moving and we are only concerned when the player is on that freeway at that turn.\n\nWe are going to consider the moves:\n\nWe are at turn 3: y=3.\n\nWe can take actions: U (to go to 4), D (to 2), or S (stay at 3). But we must avoid being on a freeway that has a car covering 0 at that turn.\n\nWe are at y=3 at turn 3. Is it safe? We are on freeway 3 at turn 3? Let's check freeway 3:\n\nFreeway 3: (-30, -41, right, 6) -> at T=3: span = [-41+6*(0), -30+6*(0)] = [-41, -30]. 0 is not in [-41, -30] -> safe.\n\nBut note: the player is at (0,3) at turn 3. The freeway 3 is at y=3? Actually, the freeways are labeled by k, and k=1 corresponds to y=1, k=2 to y=2, ... k=8 to y=8.\n\nSo at turn 3, the player is on freeway 3? Actually, the player is at y=3, so that corresponds to freeway 3? But note: the freeways are for the cars: freeway 1 (y=1) has a car, freeway 2 (y=2) has a car, etc.\n\nBut the player is at y=3, so we only care about the car on freeway 3 at turn 3. As above, safe.\n\nNow, we plan to move up. We are going to simulate each turn.\n\nWe need to know the positions of the cars at each future turn. We'll compute the span for each freeway for T>=3.\n\nLet me define T relative to t1=3: let t = T - 3, so at t=0: T=3.\n\nFreeway 1: \n  tail_T = -47 + 12*t\n  head_T = -36 + 12*t\n  We require 0 in [tail_T, head_T] -> -47+12t <= 0 <= -36+12t -> \n    -47+12t <= 0 -> 12t <= 47 -> t <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916 -> t<=3\n    and 0<=-36+12t -> 12t>=36 -> t>=3\n  So at t=3 (T=6): 0 in [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Actually, the interval is inclusive? [ -11, 0 ] -> yes, 0 is included.\n  So at T=6, freeway1 is unsafe.\n\n  Also at t=4: T=7: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\n  So freeway1 is unsafe only at T=6? Actually, at t=3: T=6: [-11,0] -> 0 is the right endpoint? So yes, collision.\n\n  But note: the car is moving right. At t=3: the car is from -47+36 = -11 to -36+36=0. So the car covers from -11 to 0. Since the player is at x=0, which is the rightmost point of the car? Then it collides.\n\nFreeway 2: \n  tail_T = -41 + 6*t\n  head_T = -30 + 6*t\n  0 in [-41+6t, -30+6t] -> \n    -41+6t <= 0 <= -30+6t\n    => 6t <= 41 -> t<=41/6≈6.833\n    and 6t>=30 -> t>=5\n    So for t=5,6: \n      t=5: T=8: [-41+30, -30+30] = [-11,0] -> 0 included -> unsafe at T=8.\n      t=6: T=9: [-41+36, -30+36] = [-5,6] -> 0 included? yes, because -5<=0<=6 -> unsafe at T=9.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway2? \n  Yes, same parameters: (-30,-41,right,6) -> same as freeway2: unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway2 -> unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway5: same -> unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway6: (60,25,right,36) -> \n  tail_T = 25 + 36*t\n  head_T = 60 + 36*t\n  0 in [25+36t, 60+36t] -> \n    25+36t <= 0? -> 36t <= -25 -> impossible because t>=0. So never unsafe.\n\nFreeway7: (96,49,right,48) -> \n  tail_T = 49+48*t\n  head_T = 96+48*t\n  positive and increasing, so 0 is never in the interval.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7 -> safe.\n\nSo unsafe freeways and turns:\n\nFreeway1: T=6 (t=3)\nFreeway2: T=8,9\nFreeway3: T=8,9\nFreeway4: T=8,9\nFreeway5: T=8,9\n\nNow, we are at turn 3 (t=0) at y=3.\n\nWe want to get to y=9. The minimal moves: 6 moves (if we go up every turn: 3->4->5->6->7->8->9, that's 6 moves, so we arrive at turn 3+6 = turn 9? But note: we start at turn3 and take an action at turn3 to go to turn4. Then at turn4 we are at y=4, and so on.\n\nLet me clarify the timeline:\n\nAt turn3: we are at y=3. Then we choose an action a_3. Then:\n  turn4: we are at y_4 = y_3 + delta(a_3)\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at some turn. The turn when we are at y=9 is the last turn of the sequence.\n\nWe are to output the actions from turn3 to the turn when we first reach 9.\n\nWe are going to simulate the moves. We must avoid being on a freeway that is unsafe at that turn.\n\nWe are at turn3 (T=3) at y=3: safe (as we saw).\n\nNow, we plan:\n\nOption 1: Go up as fast as possible.\n\nTurn3: U -> then at turn4 we are at y=4.\n\nAt turn4: T=4, y=4 -> check freeway4? \n  Freeway4: at T=4: t=1 -> tail = -41+6*1 = -35, head=-30+6= -24 -> [-35,-24] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n\nTurn4: U -> turn5: y=5.\n\nAt turn5: T=5, y=5 -> freeway5: at T=5: t=2 -> [-41+12, -30+12] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\n\nTurn5: U -> turn6: y=6.\n\nAt turn6: T=6, y=6 -> freeway6: safe (as we saw). But note: freeway1 is unsafe at T=6, but we are at y=6, so we are not on freeway1. So safe.\n\nTurn6: U -> turn7: y=7.\n\nAt turn7: T=7, y=7 -> freeway7: safe.\n\nTurn7: U -> turn8: y=8.\n\nAt turn8: T=8, y=8 -> freeway8: safe. But note: freeway2,3,4,5 are unsafe at T=8? But we are at y=8, which is freeway8, and freeway8 is safe. So safe.\n\nTurn8: U -> turn9: y=9 -> we reached.\n\nSo the sequence: \n  Turn3: U\n  Turn4: U\n  Turn5: U\n  Turn6: U\n  Turn7: U\n  Turn8: U\n\nTotal turns: 6 moves (from turn3 to turn8: 6 actions) and at turn9 we are at y=9? \n\nBut note: after the last action (at turn8) we move to y=9 at turn9. The problem says: we must be at (0,9) at the last turn of the sequence? \n\nActually, the sequence of actions is for t from 0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions. Then the state after H actions is at turn t1+H. We start at turn3. After 6 actions, we are at turn3+6=9, and at that turn we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" meaning that after the last action, we are at (0,9). So at turn t1+H, we are at (0,9). Here, at turn9, we are at (0,9).\n\nNow, we must check at each turn we are safe:\n\nTurn3: T=3, y=3 -> safe (as above)\nTurn4: T=4, y=4 -> freeway4: [-35,-24] -> safe\nTurn5: T=5, y=5 -> freeway5: [-29,-18] -> safe\nTurn6: T=6, y=6 -> freeway6: [25+36*(3)=25+108=133, 60+108=168] -> safe (since 0 not in [133,168])\nTurn7: T=7, y=7 -> freeway7: [49+48*4=49+192=241, 96+192=288] -> safe\nTurn8: T=8, y=8 -> freeway8: same as freeway7? Actually, freeway8 has the same parameters: [49+48*5=49+240=289, 96+240=336] -> safe\n\nBut note: at turn8, we are at y=8. Then we move up at turn8 to go to y=9 at turn9. At turn9, we are at y=9, and y=9 is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8) so no car to collide. So we are safe.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". So if we are at y=0 or y=9, no car to collide? And also note that the cars are only on freeways 1-8.\n\nTherefore, the above sequence is safe and takes 6 moves.\n\nBut is there a faster way? 6 moves is the minimum because we need to go from 3 to 9: 6 steps up.\n\nBut let me check if we can get there earlier? We start at turn3 at y=3. The earliest we can be at y=9 is at turn9 (if we move up every turn). So 6 moves is the minimal.\n\nBut wait: what if we move faster? We can only move one step at a time. So yes, 6 moves.\n\nBut we must check if we are safe at every step. We did, and we are safe.\n\nHowever, note that at turn9 we are at y=9, so we don't need to check freeways. But what about during the moves? We only checked the turns when we were at freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut note: at turn9 we are at y=9, and we are not on any freeway that has cars.\n\nBut let me double-check the unsafe turns:\n\nWe saw:\n  Freeway1: unsafe at T=6\n  Freeway2: unsafe at T=8 and T=9\n  Freeway3: unsafe at T=8 and T=9\n  Freeway4: unsafe at T=8 and T=9\n  Freeway5: unsafe at T=8 and T=9\n\nIn our path:\n  At T=6: we are at y=6 -> freeway6, which is safe. We are not on freeway1 (which is unsafe at T=6) because we are at y=6, not y=1.\n\n  At T=8: we are at y=8 -> freeway8 is safe. We are not on freeways 2,3,4,5 (which are unsafe at T=8) because we are at y=8.\n\n  At T=9: we are at y=9 -> no freeway, so safe. Even though freeways 2,3,4,5 are unsafe at T=9, we are not on them.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut wait, what about freeway1 at T=6: we are at y=6, so we are not on freeway1. So that's safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of turns is 6.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", meaning the number of actions? The sequence has H actions. We have 6 actions.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\n\nBut note: the actions are for turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. So we output:\n\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Here t1=3, so t=0 corresponds to a_3, t=1 to a_4, ... t=5 to a_8. Then H=6.\n\nIs there a way to do it in less than 6? No, because we must cover 6 steps.\n\nBut what if we use down? That would only make it longer.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid the unsafe freeways at the unsafe times by waiting? But in this case, we don't need to wait because we are never on the unsafe freeways at the unsafe times.\n\nBut note: at turn8, freeways 2,3,4,5 are unsafe. What if we were on one of them at turn8? Then we would have to avoid. But we are at y=8 at turn8, which is safe.\n\nSo the above sequence is valid.\n\nBut let me check if at any step we are on an unsafe freeway at the wrong time? We did:\n\nTurn3: y=3 -> freeway3: T=3 -> safe.\nTurn4: y=4 -> freeway4: T=4 -> safe.\nTurn5: y=5 -> freeway5: T=5 -> safe.\nTurn6: y=6 -> freeway6: T=6 -> safe.\nTurn7: y=7 -> freeway7: T=7 -> safe.\nTurn8: y=8 -> freeway8: T=8 -> safe.\n\nAnd then at turn9: y=9 -> no freeway.\n\nTherefore, we are safe.\n\nBut note: the car on freeway2,3,4,5 are unsafe at T=8 and T=9. But at T=8, we are at y=8, which is freeway8 and that is safe. At T=9, we are at y=9, which is not a freeway.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nBut wait: what about the car on freeway1 at T=6? At T=6, we are at y=6, which is freeway6. But freeway1 is at y=1. So we are not on freeway1.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is 6 moves of U.\n\nBut let me consider if we do a different move. What if at some point we stay? Then we would take more moves, so that would be worse.\n\nOr if we go down? Then we have to come back, which would be more than 6.\n\nSo the minimal is 6.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\n}\n\nBut note: the output format: we must write the actions for each turn starting from t1=3.\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway4 at T=4: \n  Freeway4: tail_T = -41 + 6*(4-3) = -41+6 = -35\n            head_T = -30 + 6 = -24\n            span [-35,-24] -> 0 not in between -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5 at T=5: -41+6*(2)= -41+12=-29, -30+12=-18 -> [-29,-18] -> safe.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nOne more thing: the car on freeway6 at T=6: \n  T=6: t=3 (since T-3=3)\n  tail = 25 + 36*3 = 25+108=133\n  head = 60+108=168\n  [133,168] -> 0 not included.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 at T=7: 49+48*(7-3)=49+48*4=49+192=241, 96+192=288 -> [241,288] -> safe.\n\nSo all clear.\n\nThus, the answer is the sequence of 6 'U's.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have 6 actions, so H=6.\n\nOutput:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the last action is at turn8, and after that we are at turn9 at y=9. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, we might consider if we can do it in 5 moves? That would require moving up 6 steps in 5 moves? That's impossible because each move can only change by 1. So no.\n\nTherefore, this is minimal.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) is 6. The sequence of actions consists of moving up ('U') at every turn from turn 3 to turn 8, resulting in the player reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 9.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Turn 3 (T=3, y=3)**: Freeway 3 car span is \\([-41, -30]\\) (since \\(T - 3 = 0\\), tail = \\(-41 + 6 \\times 0 = -41\\), head = \\(-30 + 6 \\times 0 = -30\\)). 0 is not in \\([-41, -30]\\). Safe.\n- **Turn 4 (T=4, y=4)**: Freeway 4 car span is \\([-35, -24]\\) (tail = \\(-41 + 6 \\times 1 = -35\\), head = \\(-30 + 6 \\times 1 = -24\\)). 0 is not in \\([-35, -24]\\). Safe.\n- **Turn 5 (T=5, y=5)**: Freeway 5 car span is \\([-29, -18]\\) (tail = \\(-41 + 6 \\times 2 = -29\\), head = \\(-30 + 6 \\times 2 = -18\\)). 0 is not in \\([-29, -18]\\). Safe.\n- **Turn 6 (T=6, y=6)**: Freeway 6 car span is \\([133, 168]\\) (tail = \\(25 + 36 \\times 3 = 133\\), head = \\(60 + 36 \\times 3 = 168\\)). 0 is not in \\([133, 168]\\). Safe.\n- **Turn 7 (T=7, y=7)**: Freeway 7 car span is \\([241, 288]\\) (tail = \\(49 + 48 \\times 4 = 241\\), head = \\(96 + 48 \\times 4 = 288\\)). 0 is not in \\([241, 288]\\). Safe.\n- **Turn 8 (T=8, y=8)**: Freeway 8 car span is \\([289, 336]\\) (tail = \\(49 + 48 \\times 5 = 289\\), head = \\(96 + 48 \\times 5 = 336\\)). 0 is not in \\([289, 336]\\). Safe.\n- **Turn 9 (T=9, y=9)**: No cars on freeway 9 (freeways are \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\)), so no collision possible.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) by moving directly upward without delay, avoiding all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U}\n}",

The current turn is t_1=4, and I start at y=4.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. Each car has a head and tail, and they move left or right at a constant speed. Collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T and for some car on that freeway, 0 is within its span at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, when I move to a new freeway, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn. So if I move up or down, at turn T, I'm still on y_T, and I move to y_{T+1} at the next turn.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9. Since I start at y=4, I need to move up at least 5 times, but I might need to move down or stay to avoid cars, which could increase the number of turns.\n\nMinimal H would be at least 5 if I go straight up, but I need to check if that's possible without collision.\n\nLet me list the car states for each freeway at turn t=4.\n\nFreeway 1: car at (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nSince it's right-moving, span at turn T is [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)]? Let's see the update:\n\nRight-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)] where t is t_1=4.\n\nIn the rule, it says for turn T > t_1, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all cars are right-moving, I think, from the table.\n\nFreeway 1: direction right, speed 12.\n\nHead and tail: given as (head h, tail τ) = (-24, -35) for freeway 1.\n\nBut for right-moving, head should be the front, so if it's moving right, head is larger than tail? In the span, for right-moving, it says [τ, h] at t_1, and then [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] at T.\n\nAt t_1=4, for freeway k, we have the span.\n\nFor freeway 1: head h=-24, tail τ=-35, both negative, but since it's moving right, at later times, it will move to the right, so span increases.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if I am on freeway y_T and for some car on that freeway, 0 is within the car's span at turn T.\n\nThat is, for freeway y_T, if there is a car where min(span) ≤ 0 ≤ max(span) at turn T.\n\nSince the span is an interval, 0 is in [min, max] of the span at T.\n\nFor right-moving cars, span at T is [τ + s(T-4), h + s(T-4)]\n\nSimilarly for left, but all are right here.\n\nFreeway 1: h=-24, τ=-35, s=12, right\n\nSo span at T: [ -35 + 12(T-4) , -24 + 12(T-4) ]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI need to find for each freeway and for each turn, whether there is a car covering position 0.\n\nBut for each freeway, there might be multiple cars? In the table, it seems only one car per freeway is listed, but it says \"Cars\" and then one tuple, so probably one car per freeway.\n\nLooking back: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\" and it's one entry per row, so one car per freeway.\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8, each has one car.\n\nNow, I need to get from y=4 to y=9, moving up, down, or stay each turn.\n\nStart at turn t=4, position (0,4).\n\nAfter each action, position changes, and at turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nI need to ensure that for each turn T from 4 to when I reach 9, when I am on y_T, the car on y_T does not cover 0 at that turn.\n\nAnd when I move to y_{T+1}, I am not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1, so I don't care about car on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nAlso, since I start at y=4 at t=4, and I need to reach y=9 at some turn, say t=H, so at turn H, I am at y=9.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway, at which turns the car covers 0.\n\nFor a given freeway k, with parameters, find T such that 0 is in span at T.\n\nThat is, for car on k, min_span(T) ≤ 0 ≤ max_span(T)\n\nSince it's a continuous move, but turns are discrete, so for each T, we can compute.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: y=1, h=-24, τ=-35, s=12, right\n\nSpan at T: [ -35 + 12(T-4) , -24 + 12(T-4) ]\n\nSet min ≤ 0 ≤ max:\n\n-35 + 12(T-4) ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 12(T-4)\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: -35 + 12(T-4) ≤ 0 => 12(T-4) ≤ 35 => T-4 ≤ 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so T-4 ≤ 2 since T integer? T is turn, integer.\n\nT-4 is integer since T and 4 are integers.\n\nT is turn number, integer.\n\nSo T-4 integer.\n\n-35 + 12(T-4) ≤ 0 => 12(T-4) ≤ 35 => T-4 ≤ 35/12 = 2 + 11/12 ≈ 2.916, so T-4 ≤ 2 since 2.916, floor, T-4 <= 2? 12*2=24, 24<=35, yes; 12*3=36>35, so T-4 <= 2? Let's see:\n\n12(T-4) <= 35, since 12*2=24<=35, 12*3=36>35, so T-4 <= 2? T-4 <= floor(35/12) but 35/12=2.916, so T-4 <=2 for inequality <=.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -24 + 12(T-4) => 24 <= 12(T-4) => 12(T-4) >=24 => T-4 >= 2.\n\nSo from first: T-4 <= 35/12 ≈2.916, so since T-4 integer, T-4 <= 2\n\nSecond: T-4 >= 2\n\nSo T-4 >=2 and T-4 <=2, so T-4=2.\n\nThus for freeway 1, 0 is in span only when T-4=2, i.e., T=6.\n\nAt T=6, min = -35 +12*2 = -35+24= -11, max= -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0 ], so 0 is included.\n\nFor other T, not covered.\n\nNow, freeway 2: y=2, car (-24,-35, right, 6)\n\ns=6\n\nSpan at T: [ -35 + 6(T-4) , -24 + 6(T-4) ]\n\nMin <=0<= max:\n\n-35 +6(T-4) <=0 <= -24 +6(T-4)\n\nFirst: -35 +6(T-4) <=0 => 6(T-4) <=35 => T-4 <= 35/6 ≈5.833, so T-4 <=5\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +6(T-4) => 24 <=6(T-4) => 4 <= T-4 => T-4 >=4\n\nSo T-4 >=4 and T-4 <=5, so T-4=4 or 5.\n\nAt T-4=4: min= -35+24= -11, max= -24+24=0, so [ -11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt T-4=5: min= -35+30= -5, max= -24+30=6, [ -5,6], 0 included.\n\nT-4=4, T=8? t_1=4, T-4=4, T=8; T-4=5, T=9.\n\nT=8 and T=9.\n\nt_1=4, so T=4 + ΔT, ΔT= T - t_1.\n\nFor ΔT=4, T=8; ΔT=5, T=9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: y=3, car (-24,-35, right, 6) same as freeway 2.\n\ns=6, same as above.\n\nSo also at ΔT=4 and 5, T=8 and 9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: y=4, car (-24,-35, right, 6) same, so T=8 and 9.\n\nFreeway 5: y=5, car (-24,-35, right, 6) same, T=8 and 9.\n\nNow freeway 6: y=6, car (-48,-83, right, 36)\n\nh=-48, τ=-83? Head and tail.\n\nSpan at T: [ -83 + 36(T-4) , -48 + 36(T-4) ]\n\nMin <=0<= max:\n\n-83 +36(ΔT) <=0 <= -48 +36(ΔT) where ΔT = T-4\n\nFirst: -83 +36ΔT <=0 => 36ΔT <=83 => ΔT <=83/36≈2.305, so ΔT <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +36ΔT => 48 <=36ΔT => ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so ΔT >= 2 since integer? ΔT integer.\n\nΔT >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) = 2\n\nAnd ΔT <= floor(83/36) but 83/36=2.305, floor=2\n\nΔT <=2 and ΔT >=2, so ΔT=2.\n\nThus T=4+2=6.\n\nAt ΔT=2: min= -83 + 36*2 = -83+72= -11, max= -48+72=24, so [ -11,24], 0 included.\n\nNow freeway 7: y=7, car (-48,-95, right, 48)\n\nSpan at T: [ -95 + 48(ΔT) , -48 + 48(ΔT) ]? For right-moving, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nτ=-95, h=-48\n\nSo [ -95 +48ΔT , -48 +48ΔT ]\n\nMin <=0<= max:\n\n-95 +48ΔT <=0 <= -48 +48ΔT\n\nFirst: -95 +48ΔT <=0 => 48ΔT <=95 => ΔT <=95/48≈1.979, so ΔT <=1\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +48ΔT => 48 <=48ΔT => ΔT >=1\n\nSo ΔT >=1 and ΔT <=1, thus ΔT=1, T=5.\n\nAt ΔT=1: min= -95+48= -47, max= -48+48=0, so [ -47,0], 0 included.\n\nFreeway 8: y=8, car (-48,-95, right, 48) same as above.\n\nSo also at ΔT=1, T=5.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when car covers 0:\n\ny=1: only at T=6\n\ny=2: at T=8 and T=9\n\ny=3: at T=8 and T=9\n\ny=4: at T=8 and T=9\n\ny=5: at T=8 and T=9\n\ny=6: at T=6\n\ny=7: at T=5\n\ny=8: at T=5\n\nT=5,6,8,9 are dangerous turns for those freeways.\n\nNow, I start at t=4, y=4.\n\nAt t=4, I am on y=4. Is there a car on y=4 covering 0 at t=4?\n\nFor y=4, car covers at T=8 and 9, not at T=4, since ΔT=0, min= -35 +0= -35, max= -24, both negative, so 0 not in [-35,-24], so safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways at t=4, only y=7 and y=8 cover at T=5, not now.\n\nSo at t=4, safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nSince I start at y=4, and need to reach y=9, I must increase y by 5.\n\nEach U action increases y by 1, D decreases, S stays.\n\nMinimal turns is 5 if I go U every turn.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on a freeway when car covers 0.\n\nNow, let's consider the path.\n\nFirst, at t=4, y=4, safe.\n\nNow, I can choose action for t=4, which will determine y at t=5.\n\nAction at t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\na_t at turn t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at turn t, I am at y_t, and after action a_t, I go to y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t if on y_t and car on y_t covers 0 at t.\n\nNow, for t=4, y=4, car on y=4: as above, covers only at T=8 and 9, not at t=4, so safe.\n\nNow, I need to choose a_4.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf I go U, y_5 = 5\n\nIf D, y_5=3\n\nIf S, y_5=4\n\nNow, at t=5, I will be on y_5.\n\nNow, for y=5, car covers at T=8 and 9, not at T=5, so at t=5, if I am on y=5, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3: car on y=3 covers at T=8,9, not at T=5.\n\ny=4: same.\n\nBut also, freeway y=7 and y=8 have cars covering at T=5.\n\nBut if I am on y=7 or y=8 at t=5, I collide.\n\nAt t=5, if I am on y=7 or y=8, and since car on that y covers 0 at t=5, I collide.\n\nNow, back to choosing a_4.\n\nIf I go U, to y=5 at t=5, which is safe.\n\nIf I go D, to y=3 at t=5, safe.\n\nIf I stay, y=4 at t=5, safe.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are dangerous at t=5, I should avoid being on them at t=5.\n\nBut at t=5, I can be on y=3,4,5, all safe.\n\nNow, similarly, at t=6, freeway y=1 and y=6 have cars covering 0.\n\ny=1 at T=6, y=6 at T=6.\n\nSo if on y=1 or y=6 at t=6, collide.\n\nOther freeways: y=2,3,4,5 cover at T=8,9, not at t=6.\n\ny=7 and y=8 cover only at T=5, not at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, ΔT=2, for y=7: min= -95 +48*2= -95+96=1, max= -48+96=48, so [1,48], 0 not included.\n\nSimilarly y=8 same.\n\ny=1: min= -35+24= -11, max=0, [ -11,0], 0 included.\n\ny=6: min= -83+72= -11, max=24, [ -11,24], 0 included.\n\nSo at t=6, dangerous for y=1 and y=6.\n\nNow, let's think about getting to y=9.\n\ny=9 has no car? Freeways are y=1 to 8, y=9 is the target, no car, so once I reach y=9, I don't need to worry about cars.\n\nBut I need to be on y=9 at some turn, and at that turn, since no car, safe.\n\nThe target is (0,9), so when I am at (0,9), I have reached.\n\nNow, back to actions.\n\nI start at t=4, y=4.\n\nI want to minimize turns, so I should go up as much as possible, but avoid dangerous situations.\n\nSuppose I go up at t=4: a_4=U, then y_5=5\n\nAt t=5, I am on y=5. Car on y=5: covers at T=8,9, not at t=5, so safe.\n\nNow, at t=5, I choose action for y_6.\n\nPossible: U to y=6, D to y=4, S to y=5.\n\nBut at t=6, y=6 is dangerous, because car covers 0.\n\nIf I go to y=6 at t=6, I collide.\n\ny_6 depends on a_5.\n\nIf I choose a_5=U, then y_6=6, but at t=6, on y=6, collide.\n\nIf a_5=D, y_6=4\n\nIf a_5=S, y_6=5\n\nNow, y=4 or y=5 at t=6 are safe, since only y=1 and y=6 dangerous.\n\ny=4 and y=5 are safe at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=3, but I am at y=5, I can go down to 4 or stay at 5.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nIf at t=5, I go U to y=6, but at t=6, I would be on y=6 and collide, so I cannot do that.\n\nSo I must not be on y=6 at t=6.\n\nTherefore, at t=5, I cannot choose U if I want to avoid collision at t=6.\n\nI could choose D or S.\n\nIf I choose S at t=5, y_6=5, safe at t=6.\n\nIf I choose D, y_6=4, also safe.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9, so staying or going down might not be efficient.\n\nAfter t=6, the danger is at t=8 and t=9 for y=2,3,4,5.\n\nLet's list dangerous turns:\n\n- t=5: dangerous for y=7 and y=8\n\n- t=6: dangerous for y=1 and y=6\n\n- t=8: dangerous for y=2,3,4,5\n\n- t=9: dangerous for y=2,3,4,5\n\ny=2,3,4,5 all dangerous at t=8 and t=9.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe always, no car.\n\nBut to be on y=9, I need to get there.\n\nNow, let's plan the path turn by turn.\n\nStart: t=4, y=4, safe.\n\nAction a_4: I can choose U, D, or S.\n\nIf I choose U, y_5=5\n\nIf I choose D, y_5=3\n\nIf S, y_5=4\n\nNow, at t=5, if I am on y=5, safe, as established.\n\nIf on y=3 or y=4, also safe.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 dangerous, but I am not on them.\n\nNow, from y=5, at t=5, I need to choose action for t=6.\n\nAs above, I cannot go to y=6 at t=6, because dangerous.\n\nSo I must choose to go down or stay: a_5=D or S, so y_6=4 or 5.\n\nBoth safe at t=6.\n\nSuppose I stay at y=5: a_5=S, then y_6=5\n\nAt t=6, y=5, safe.\n\nNow, at t=6, I choose action for y_7.\n\na_6: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go U, y_7=6\n\nBut at t=7, what about cars?\n\nI need to know if any freeway dangerous at t=7.\n\nFor each freeway, at ΔT=3, T=7.\n\ny=1: at T=7, ΔT=3, min= -35+12*3= -35+36=1, max= -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\ny=2: ΔT=3, min= -35+6*3= -35+18= -17, max= -24+18= -6, both negative, [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe. Similarly for y=3,4,5 all same s=6, min= -35+18= -17, max= -24+18= -6, all negative, safe.\n\ny=6: ΔT=3, min= -83+36*3= -83+108=25, max= -48+108=60, [25,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\ny=7: ΔT=3, min= -95+48*3= -95+144=49, max= -48+144=96, safe.\n\ny=8: similar.\n\nSo at t=7, all freeways are safe, no car covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, t=10, etc., but we might reach before.\n\nt=8 and t=9 dangerous for y=2,3,4,5.\n\nBack to t=6, I am at y=5, safe.\n\nI can go up to y=6 at t=7.\n\na_6=U, then y_7=6\n\nAt t=7, on y=6, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen from there, I can go up to y=7, etc.\n\nBut I need to avoid t=8 and t=9 on y=2,3,4,5.\n\ny=2,3,4,5 dangerous at t=8 and t=9.\n\nNow, y=6,7,8 are not dangerous at t=8 and t=9? Let's check.\n\nAt t=8, ΔT=4.\n\ny=6: car, at ΔT=4, min= -83 +36*4= -83+144=61, max= -48+144=96, [61,96], 0 not in.\n\ny=7: min= -95 +48*4= -95+192=97, max= -48+192=144, safe.\n\ny=8: similar.\n\ny=1: at ΔT=4, min= -35+48=13? 12*4=48, min=-35+48=13, max=-24+48=24, safe.\n\ny=2: ΔT=4, min= -35+24= -11, max= -24+24=0, [ -11,0], 0 covered, dangerous.\n\nSimilarly y=3,4,5 same.\n\nSo only y=2,3,4,5 dangerous at t=8 and t=9.\n\ny=6,7,8 safe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nNow, back to path.\n\nI am at t=6, y=5.\n\nIf I go U at t=6, to y_7=6 at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, I choose a_7.\n\nI can go U to y=7, or S, or D.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9.\n\nIf I go U to y=7 at t=8? y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\na_7 at t=7, y_8 = y_7 + Δy_7\n\nAt t=7, y=7.\n\nThen a_7=U, y_8=8\n\na_7=S, y_8=7\n\na_7=D, y_8=6\n\nNow, at t=8, I will be on y_8.\n\nt=8 is dangerous for y=2,3,4,5, but not for y=6,7,8.\n\nSo if I am on y=7 or y=8 at t=8, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 safe.\n\nNow, if I go to y=7 at t=7, then at t=8, I can be on y=8 if I go up, or y=7, or y=6.\n\nBut y=8 at t=8 is safe.\n\nThen from there to y=9.\n\ny=9 is above, no freeway.\n\nNow, let's see the sequence.\n\nStart: t=4, y=4\n\na_4: I choose U, so y_5=5\n\nt=5, y=5, safe\n\na_5: I need to avoid y=6 at t=6, so I cannot go U. So I choose S or D.\n\nIf I choose S, y_6=5\n\nt=6, y=5, safe\n\na_6: now I can go U, to y_7=6\n\nt=7, y=6, safe\n\na_7: go U to y_8=7\n\nt=8, y=7, safe (since y=7 not dangerous at t=8)\n\na_8: go U to y_9=8\n\nt=9, y=8, now at t=9, is it dangerous?\n\nt=9, ΔT=5.\n\ny=8: car, min= -95 +48*5= -95+240=145, max= -48+240=192, safe.\n\nBut y=8 is dangerous at t=5, not at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, dangerous for y=2,3,4,5.\n\ny=8 safe.\n\nSo at t=9, y=8, safe.\n\na_9: go U to y_10=9\n\nt=10, y=9, reached.\n\nBut H should be minimal number of turns from t_1 to when I reach.\n\nt=4 start, at t=10 I reach y=9, so it took 6 turns: from t=4 to t=9 actions, and at t=10 position y=9.\n\nThe actions are from t=4 to t=9, 6 actions, H=6.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nMinimal would be 5 turns: from y=4 to y=9 in 5 steps, all U.\n\nBut in that case: t=4, y=4\n\na_4=U, y_5=5\n\na_5=U, y_6=6\n\nBut at t=6, if y=6, collide, because car on y=6 covers 0 at t=6.\n\nSo impossible to go directly up in 5 turns.\n\nThus H=6 is possible as above.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach earlier or with different path.\n\nFor example, at t=4, if I go down, but that might take more turns.\n\nOr, at t=5, instead of staying, I go down, but that would make me go lower, need to come back, probably more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=4, go D: a_4=D, y_5=3\n\nt=5, y=3, safe\n\nThen a_5=U, y_6=4\n\nt=6, y=4, safe (since y=4 dangerous only at t=8,9)\n\nThen a_6=U, y_7=5\n\nt=7, y=5, safe\n\na_7=U, y_8=6\n\nt=8, y=6, safe (y=6 not dangerous at t=8)\n\na_8=U, y_9=7\n\nt=9, y=7, safe\n\na_9=U, y_10=8\n\nt=10, y=8, safe\n\na_10=U, y_11=9, t=11, reached.\n\nThis takes 7 turns, worse than previous.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay at some point.\n\nBut the first path is better: U, S, U, U, U, U with H=6.\n\nIn the first path: actions from t=4 to t=9: a4 to a9.\n\nt=4: a4=U, y5=5\n\nt=5: a5=S, y6=5\n\nt=6: a6=U, y7=6\n\nt=7: a7=U, y8=7\n\nt=8: a8=U, y9=8\n\nt=9: a9=U, y10=9\n\nAt t=10, y=9.\n\nBut at t=9, I am at y=8, and I do U to go to y=9.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, actions are for turns t=4 to t=9, 6 actions.\n\nBut I reached at t=10.\n\nIs there a way to reach at t=9?\n\nAt t=9, y=9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn t=9.\n\nThen I must have been at y=8 at t=8, and go U.\n\nOr at y=9 at t=8, but if I am at y=9 at t=8, I already reached, but we need to reach at some turn, so if I reach earlier, better.\n\nBut minimal H, so if I can reach at t=9 with y=9, that would be H=5 turns? From t=4 to t=9 is 5 turns later? Let's see.\n\nStart at t=4, after H turns, I am at turn t_1 + H -1? The problem says: sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is changed.\n\nAt turn t_1, position (0, y_{t_1})\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position at turn t_1 +1 is (0, y_{t_1 +1})\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H-1}, position at turn t_1 + H is (0, y_{t_1 + H})\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case t_1=4, so at turn T = t_1 + H, y_T=9.\n\nT = 4 + H.\n\nWe want to minimize H.\n\nIn the sequence above, with H=6, T=10, y=9.\n\nCan I have smaller H?\n\nH=5: T=9, y_9=9.\n\nThen I need to be at y=9 at turn 9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 9, I must have y_8 and a_8 such that y_9 = y_8 + Δy_8 =9.\n\nSince y_8 <=8, I need y_8=8 and a_8=U, or y_8=9 and a_8=S, but if y_8=9, I already reached, so probably not, or I can, but to minimize, reaching earlier is better.\n\nIf I reach at turn T with y_T=9, that is fine, even if I could have reached earlier but didn't.\n\nBut to minimize H, we should reach as early as possible.\n\nSo for H=5, can I have y_{9} =9?\n\ny_9=9.\n\nNow, y_9 depends on y_8 and a_8.\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy_8\n\nIf y_8=8, a_8=U, then y_9=9.\n\nIf y_8=9, a_8=S, then y_9=9, but if y_8=9, I already reached at turn 8, so for H=5, I should consider reaching at turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, y_9=9 requires that at turn 9, I am on y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, back to path.\n\nI need to be at y=8 at turn 8 to go up.\n\nOr at y=9 at turn 8, but let's see if possible.\n\nStart at t=4, y=4.\n\nAfter 4 actions, at turn 8, y_8.\n\nThen with a_8, y_9.\n\nFor y_9=9, need y_8=8 and a_8=U.\n\nNow, can I be at y=8 at turn 8?\n\nTurn 8 is dangerous for y=2,3,4,5, but y=8 is safe at turn 8.\n\nSo if I can be at y=8 at turn 8, then a_8=U to y_9=9.\n\nNow, from start, how to get to y=8 by turn 8.\n\nt=4, y=4\n\nt=5, y=?\n\nt=6, y=?\n\nt=7, y=?\n\nt=8, y=8\n\nWith actions from t=4 to t=7, 4 actions? From t=4 to t=7 inclusive? Actions a_t for t=4,5,6,7 to reach position at t=8.\n\ny_8 depends on actions from t=4 to t=7.\n\nSpecifically, y_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\ny_6 = y_5 + Δy_5\n\ny_7 = y_6 + Δy_6\n\ny_8 = y_7 + Δy_7\n\nWe start y_4=4, want y_8=8.\n\nThe net change must be +4 in 4 steps, so possible if I go up 4 times, or up 3 and stay once, etc., but since I need to avoid collisions, going up all the way might not be possible.\n\nFirst, if I go up all: a4=U, y5=5\n\na5=U, y6=6\n\nBut at t=6, y=6, collide, impossible.\n\nIf at some point I stay or go down.\n\nBut I need net +4.\n\nFor example, suppose I go up at t=4 to y=5.\n\nThen at t=5, instead of going up, I stay or go down to avoid t=6 on y=6.\n\nBut if I stay at t=5, y6=5\n\nThen at t=6, I am at y=5, safe.\n\nNow, from there, I need to get to y=8 by t=8.\n\nt=6, y=5\n\nt=7, y?\n\nt=8, y=8\n\nIn two steps, from y=5 to y=8, need +3, so I must go up both times, but t=7 to t=8.\n\na6 and a7.\n\nIf a6=U, y7=6\n\na7=U, y8=7, but I need y8=8, so only 7, not 8.\n\ny7=6, then a7=U, y8=7, not 8.\n\nTo get to y=8, from y=5 at t=6, in two steps: y6=5, y7 = y6 + Δy6, y8 = y7 + Δy7.\n\ny8 = y6 + Δy6 + Δy7\n\nSince y6=5, y8=8, so Δy6 + Δy7 =3.\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,+1, so sum=3 only if both +1 and one more +1, but two actions, max sum=2, so y8 <= 5+1+1=7, cannot reach y=8 from y=5 in two steps.\n\ny6=5, after a6, y7 <=6, after a7, y8 <=7.\n\nSo maximum y8=7 if I go up twice.\n\nBut I need y8=8 for H=5, so impossible to reach y=8 at turn 8 from start position with the constraints.\n\nStart y4=4.\n\nAfter a4, y5 <=5\n\nAfter a5, y6 <=6\n\nBut at t=6, y6 cannot be 6, collide.\n\ny6 <=5 if I don't go up at a5.\n\nSuppose y5=5 (after a4=U)\n\nThen a5, if I go U, y6=6 collide, so must not, so y6 <=5.\n\nThen after a6, y7 <=6\n\nAfter a7, y8 <=7\n\nSo y8 <=7, cannot be 8.\n\nIf I go down at some point, y8 even less.\n\nSo impossible to have y8=8.\n\nTherefore, cannot reach y=9 at turn 9 with H=5, because that requires y8=8 and a8=U, but y8 cannot be 8.\n\nIf I reach earlier, at turn 8, y8=9.\n\nBut to have y8=9, from y4=4, in 4 actions, net +5, but each action max +1, so in 4 actions, max y8=4+4=8, cannot be 9.\n\ny4=4, after a4, y5<=5, a5, y6<=6, but y6=6 not possible, so y6<=5, a6, y7<=6, a7, y8<=7, so y8<=7 <9, cannot reach y=9 before turn 9? Turn 9 is possible if y8=8 and a8=U.\n\nBut y8 cannot be 8, as above.\n\nTurn 8: y8 <=7, as above.\n\nThen at turn 8, y8<=7, then to reach y=9, I need at least one more action, to turn 9 or later.\n\nFor example, at turn 8, y8=7, then a8=U, y9=8, still not 9.\n\nThen a9=U, y10=9.\n\nOr if y8=7, a8=U, y9=8, then a9=U, y10=9.\n\nBut y9=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y9=9, need y8=8 and a8=U, but y8 cannot be 8.\n\ny8 <=7.\n\nThen y9 = y8 + Δy8 <=7+1=8.\n\nSo y9 <=8, cannot be 9 at turn 9.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach y=9 at turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 10, y10=9 is possible, as in the first path.\n\nWith H=6 actions, from t=4 to t=9, reaching at t=10.\n\nBut in the first path, with a4=U, a5=S, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U.\n\nAt t=10, y=9.\n\nIn this, at t=8, I was at y=7, which is safe.\n\nt=9 at y=8, safe.\n\nNow, but at t=8, y=7 is fine.\n\nIn the action sequence, I have a5=S, which is stay, but I could avoid staying if possible.\n\nFor example, at t=5, instead of staying, I could go down and come back, but that might take more turns.\n\nAnother idea: at t=4, go up to y=5.\n\nThen at t=5, instead of staying, go down to y=4? Then y6=4 at t=6.\n\nThen from y=4, I can go up to y=5 at t=7, etc.\n\nBut let's see: t=4, a4=U, y5=5\n\nt=5, a5=D, y6=4\n\nt=6, y=4, safe\n\na6=U, y7=5\n\nt=7, y=5, safe\n\na7=U, y8=6\n\nt=8, y=6, safe (since y=6 not dangerous at t=8)\n\na8=U, y9=7\n\nt=9, y=7, safe\n\na9=U, y10=8\n\na10=U, y11=9, takes 7 actions, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nAt t=7, from y=5, I could go directly to higher, but no.\n\nAnother point: in the first path, I stayed at t=5, but I could have gone up at a different time.\n\nBut I need to avoid t=6 on y=6.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=7 or y=8 earlier.\n\nBut y=7 is dangerous at t=5.\n\nt=5, y=7 dangerous.\n\nBut at t=5, I start from y=4 or 5.\n\nTo be on y=7 at t=5, I would need to be at y=6 or 7 at t=4, but at t=4 I am at y=4, so impossible to be on y=7 at t=5 directly.\n\ny_5 = y_4 + Δy_4, so from y=4, y_5 <=5, so cannot be on y=7 at t=5.\n\nSimilarly, only possible to be on y=1 to 5 at t=5 from start.\n\ny=5 is safe, as before.\n\nNow, back to minimizing H.\n\nH=6 seems minimal.\n\nBut in the first path, I used a stay, which might not be necessary, but I think it is to avoid the collision at t=6.\n\nPerhaps I can go up at t=4 to y=5, then at t=5, instead of staying, I go up, but then y6=6, collide.\n\nUnless I can be on a different freeway.\n\nAnother idea: go down at the beginning.\n\nFor example, a4=D, to y5=3\n\nt=5, y=3, safe\n\nThen a5=U, to y6=4\n\nt=6, y=4, safe\n\nThen a6=U, to y7=5\n\nt=7, y=5, safe\n\na7=U, to y8=6\n\nt=8, y=6, safe\n\na8=U, to y9=7\n\nt=9, y=7, safe\n\na9=U, to y10=8\n\na10=U, to y11=9, 7 actions, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nFrom y=4, go up to y=5, stay at t=5 to y=5, then at t=6, instead of going up immediately, but I have to go up later.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 faster by going through other paths, but I think not.\n\nAnother thought: since y=8 is dangerous at t=5, but I am not going there early.\n\nIn the first path, with H=6, it works.\n\nBut let me confirm the actions.\n\nt=4: action a4=U, position at t=5: y=5\n\nt=5: action a5=S, position at t=6: y=5\n\nt=6: action a6=U, position at t=7: y=6\n\nt=7: action a7=U, position at t=8: y=7\n\nt=8: action a8=U, position at t=9: y=8\n\nt=9: action a9=U, position at t=10: y=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt t=4: y=4, car on y=4: span at t=4: ΔT=0, min=-35, max=-24, both neg, 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=5: y=5, car on y=5: at t=5, ΔT=1, min=-35+6= -29, max=-24+6= -18, both neg, [-29,-18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=6: y=5, car on y=5: at t=6, ΔT=2, min=-35+12= -23, max=-24+12= -12, both neg, safe.\n\nt=7: y=6, car on y=6: at t=7, ΔT=3, min=-83+108=25, max=-48+108=60, [25,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=8: y=7, car on y=7: at t=8, ΔT=4, min=-95+192=97, max=-48+192=144, safe.\n\nt=9: y=8, car on y=8: at t=9, ΔT=5, min=-95+240=145, max=-48+240=192, safe.\n\nt=10: y=9, no car, safe.\n\nAnd I reached.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=5? As we saw, impossible.\n\nPerhaps with different sequence.\n\nFor example, at t=4, go S, stay at y=4.\n\nThen y5=4 at t=5.\n\nt=5, y=4, car on y=4: at t=5, min=-35+6= -29? ΔT=1, min=-35+6(1)= -29, max=-24+6= -18, neg, safe.\n\nThen a5=U, to y6=5 at t=6.\n\nt=6, y=5, as before, safe.\n\nThen a6=U, to y7=6 at t=7.\n\nThen same as before, but now I started with stay, so at t=7 y=6, then a7=U to y8=7, a8=U to y9=8, a9=U to y10=9, still H=6 actions, same as before, but I wasted a turn staying at beginning, whereas in first I stayed later, but same number.\n\nIn this case, actions: t=4: S, t=5: U, t=6: U, t=7: U, t=8: U, t=9: U, to reach at t=10.\n\nBut compared to first: U, S, U, U, U, U, same number.\n\nBut in first, I have one stay, here also one stay.\n\nBut I could avoid stay?\n\nFor example, if I can go up continuously except avoiding the collision point.\n\nBut at t=6, I cannot be on y=6.\n\nSo I must be on y<=5 at t=6.\n\nSince I start at y=4 at t=4, after two actions (t=4 and t=5), I am at y_6.\n\ny_6 = y_4 + Δy_4 + Δy_5\n\ny_4=4, so y_6 = 4 + Δy_4 + Δy_5\n\nEach Δy <=1, so y_6 <= 4+1+1=6.\n\nBut y_6 cannot be 6, so y_6 <=5.\n\nThus, Δy_4 + Δy_5 <=1.\n\nSo not both can be +1; at least one must be 0 or -1.\n\nThat is, I cannot have two up actions in the first two steps; I must have a stay or down in one of the first two actions.\n\nTherefore, minimal actions require at least one non-up in the first two steps, but since I need to go up overall, I will have at least one non-up, so H at least 6, since 5 up and one other, but net +5, so if I have one stay, I need 6 actions: 5U and one S, or 6U but with one down and one extra up, but more actions.\n\nWith 6 actions, I can have 5U and one S, net +5, reach y=9.\n\nIf I have a down, I need extra up.\n\nSo minimal H=6 with one stay.\n\nIn the sequence, I can place the stay at different points, but as long as I avoid the collision.\n\nIn the first sequence, I placed the stay at t=5.\n\nI could place at t=4, but then I start by staying, which delays.\n\nBut same H.\n\nNow, in the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut let me see if I can go to y=8 or 9 faster, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=7, all clear, I can go up faster.\n\nBut from t=4, I need to get to higher y.\n\nFor example, at t=4, go U to y=5.\n\nt=5, instead of stay, I must do S or D, but if I do D to y=4, then at t=6 y=4, then I can go U to y=5 at t=7? t=6 a6=U to y7=6, etc., but same as before.\n\nAfter t=6, I can go up multiple times.\n\nIn the sequence, from t=7 to t=9, I go up to y=8, then to y=9.\n\nBut at t=9, I am at y=8, which is safe.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at t=9 if I were higher, but I cannot.\n\nI think H=6 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence, in the first path: actions at t=4: U, t=5: S, t=6: U, t=7: U, t=8: U, t=9: U.\n\nBut t=9: a9=U to y10=9.\n\nNow, the sequence is for turns t=4 to t=9.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} which is a_4\n\nTurn t_1+1: a_5\n\n...\n\nUp to t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nHere t_1=4, H=6, so actions from t=4 to t=9.\n\nt=4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nWith a4=U, a5=S, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U.\n\nPosition at t=10: y=9.\n\nTo write:\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point I am on dangerous spot.\n\nt=4: y=4, safe as above.\n\nt=5: y=5, safe.\n\nt=6: y=5, safe.\n\nt=7: y=6, safe.\n\nt=8: y=7, safe.\n\nt=9: y=8, safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps I can have a sequence without stay, but with down and up, but that would require more actions, so H larger, not minimal.\n\nFor example, if I go down at t=5 to y=4, then up later, but I need extra up, so H=7 or more.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo this should be minimal.\n\nIn the sequence, I used one stay, which is necessary to avoid the collision at t=6 on y=6.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 6, car is (-48,-83,right,36), and we used that.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the answer format should be with t_1, but since t_1=4, it's clear.\n\nWrite as:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\end{array} }\n\nSince it's text, but in the format given.\n\nIn the problem, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so with the turn numbers.\n\nSince t_1=4, we use numbers.\n\nI think it's ok.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) is 6. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a freeway when a car covers position 0 at that turn.\n\n- At turn 4, the player is at \\(y = 4\\). The action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 5. This is safe because the car on freeway 4 (current freeway) does not cover 0 at turn 4 (span \\([-35, -24]\\), 0 not in range).\n- At turn 5, the player is at \\(y = 5\\). The action \\(S\\) keeps the player at \\(y = 5\\) for turn 6. This is safe because the car on freeway 5 does not cover 0 at turn 5 (span \\([-29, -18]\\), 0 not in range).\n- At turn 6, the player is at \\(y = 5\\). The action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 7. This is safe because the car on freeway 5 does not cover 0 at turn 6 (span \\([-23, -12]\\), 0 not in range), and freeway 6 is dangerous at turn 6 but the player is not on it until turn 7.\n- At turn 7, the player is at \\(y = 6\\). The action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 8. This is safe because the car on freeway 6 does not cover 0 at turn 7 (span \\([25, 60]\\), 0 not in range).\n- At turn 8, the player is at \\(y = 7\\). The action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 9. This is safe because the car on freeway 7 does not cover 0 at turn 8 (span \\([97, 144]\\), 0 not in range).\n- At turn 9, the player is at \\(y = 8\\). The action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 10. This is safe because the car on freeway 8 does not cover 0 at turn 9 (span \\([145, 192]\\), 0 not in range), and \\(y = 9\\) has no car.\n\nAt turn 10, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\). This sequence uses \\(H = 6\\) turns, which is minimal because:\n- Reaching \\(y = 9\\) in fewer turns (e.g., \\(H = 5\\)) is impossible. For \\(H = 5\\), the player would need to be at \\(y = 9\\) at turn 9, requiring \\(y_8 = 8\\) and action \\(U\\) at turn 8. However, from \\(y_4 = 4\\), the maximum \\(y_8\\) achievable while avoiding collisions is 7 (due to the collision risk at \\(y = 6\\) on turn 6 preventing early ascent). Thus, \\(y_9 \\leq 8\\), making \\(H = 6\\) the minimum.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\end{array} }",

Collision happens only if I'm on a freeway y at turn T and for that freeway, 0 is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. All cars are moving right, according to the table. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)], since it moves in the positive direction.\n\nt1 is 5, the current turn.\n\nLet me list out the car states at t1=5:\n\n- Freeway 1: head h=-12, tail τ=-23, direction right, speed s=12\n\n- Freeway 2: h=-18, τ=-29, right, s=6\n\n- Freeway 3: same as 2, h=-18, τ=-29, right, s=6\n\n- Freeway 4: same, h=-18, τ=-29, right, s=6\n\n- Freeway 5: same, h=-18, τ=-29, right, s=6\n\n- Freeway 6: h=-12, τ=-47, right, s=36\n\n- Freeway 7: h=0, τ=-47, right, s=48\n\n- Freeway 8: same as 7, h=0, τ=-47, right, s=48\n\nFor freeway 7 and 8, at t1=5, head is at 0, tail at -47, moving right at speed 48. Since it's moving right, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-47 + 48(T-5), 0 + 48(T-5)] = [48(T-5) -47, 48(T-5)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, I am on freeway y, and for that freeway, 0 is in the car span at T.\n\nI start at y=5 at t=5. I need to reach y=9.\n\nPlayer position: at each turn, I choose action: U (up, y increases by 1), D (down, y decreases by 1), or S (stay, y same). y is clamped between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nSince I'm at y=5 and need to go to y=9, I probably want to go up, but I have to avoid the cars on freeways 1-8 when I'm on them.\n\nI need to find when it's safe to be on each freeway.\n\nFirst, let's define the time relative to t1. Let t be the number of turns after t1, so at time t1 + t, for t=0,1,2,...\n\nAt t=0, current turn, position y=5.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some H, where H is the number of turns, so after H actions, I should be at y=9.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so at turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, at turn t1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position (0, y_T).\n\nI choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am at y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T if y_T = k for some freeway k=1 to 8, and 0 is in the car span for freeway k at turn T.\n\nThe note says: if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, only at T+1.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T, I am on y_T.\n\nSo for collision, only when I am on a freeway at that exact turn.\n\nNow, I need to find for each freeway, at which turns 0 is in the car span.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway k, the times when 0 is in the span.\n\nFor a given freeway, at time T (global time, T >= t1), the span is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)] for right-moving cars.\n\nSince all are right-moving.\n\nSet Δt = T - t1, so time since current turn.\n\nFor freeway k, span at time T is [τ_k + s_k * Δt, h_k + s_k * Δt]\n\n0 is in span if τ_k + s_k Δt <= 0 <= h_k + s_k Δt\n\nSince the car is moving right, and h is head, τ is tail, so for right-moving, head is at higher x, so span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume.\n\nIn the update: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], and since it's moving right, the head is increasing, so h + s(T-t1) should be the right end, so h > τ, I think.\n\nLook at the values.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: τ=-23, h=-12, so τ < h, since -23 < -12.\n\nSimilarly, all have τ < h? Freeway 2: τ=-29, h=-18, -29 < -18, yes.\n\nFreeway 6: τ=-47, h=-12, -47 < -12.\n\nFreeway 7: τ=-47, h=0, -47 < 0.\n\nSo for all, τ_k <= h_k, so span is [left, right] with left = τ_k + s_k Δt, right = h_k + s_k Δt.\n\n0 is in span if left <= 0 <= right, i.e., τ_k + s_k Δt <= 0 and 0 <= h_k + s_k Δt\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nτ_k + s_k Δt <= 0  => s_k Δt <= -τ_k  => Δt <= -τ_k / s_k\n\nAnd 0 <= h_k + s_k Δt => s_k Δt >= -h_k => Δt >= -h_k / s_k\n\nAlso, since Δt >=0, and times are integers, I assume.\n\nT is turn number, so integer, Δt integer >=0.\n\nSo for each freeway, collision at time T (global) if Δt satisfies:\n\nmax( ceil( -h_k / s_k ) , 0 ) <= Δt <= floor( -τ_k / s_k )\n\nFrom above:\n\nΔt >= -h_k / s_k\n\nΔt <= -τ_k / s_k\n\nSince τ_k and h_k are negative, -τ_k and -h_k are positive.\n\nSet L_k = -τ_k / s_k  (since τ_k negative, -τ_k positive)\n\nU_k = -h_k / s_k  (h_k negative or zero, -h_k positive or zero)\n\nThen Δt >= U_k and Δt <= L_k\n\nFrom above:\n\nΔt >= -h_k / s_k = U_k\n\nΔt <= -τ_k / s_k = L_k\n\nAnd collision if U_k <= Δt <= L_k\n\nBut U_k and L_k may not be integer, so we need to take ceil for lower bound and floor for upper bound, since Δt integer.\n\nΔt >= ceil(U_k) and Δt <= floor(L_k)\n\nIf U_k and L_k are integers, it's fine, but if not, we need to handle the inequalities.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: τ = -23, h = -12, s = 12\n\nU_k = -h / s = -(-12)/12 = 12/12 = 1\n\nL_k = -τ / s = -(-23)/12 = 23/12 ≈ 1.9167\n\nSo Δt >= ceil(U_k) = ceil(1) = 1\n\nΔt <= floor(L_k) = floor(23/12) = floor(1.9167) = 1\n\nSo Δt >=1 and Δt <=1, so only at Δt=1\n\nThat is, at T = t1 + 1 = 6\n\nNow, check: at Δt=0, T=t1=5, left = τ + s*0 = -23, right = h + s*0 = -12, 0 not in [-23,-12]\n\nAt Δt=1, T=6, left = -23 +12*1 = -11, right = -12 +12*1 = 0, so [ -11, 0 ], 0 is included, since <= right.\n\nright = -12 +12 =0, so 0 <= 0, yes, included.\n\nAt Δt=2, T=7, left = -23 +24 =1, right= -12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo yes, only at Δt=1.\n\nFreeway 2: τ=-29, h=-18, s=6\n\nU_k = -h/s = -(-18)/6 = 18/6=3\n\nL_k = -τ/s = -(-29)/6 = 29/6 ≈4.833\n\nΔt >= ceil(U_k) = ceil(3) =3\n\nΔt <= floor(L_k) = floor(29/6) = floor(4.833) =4\n\nBut 3 <= Δt <=4? Δt=3 and 4?\n\nU_k=3, ceil=3, L_k=29/6≈4.833, floor=4\n\nSo Δt >=3 and Δt <=4, so Δt=3 or 4.\n\nAt Δt=3, T=8, left = τ + s*3 = -29 +6*3 = -29+18= -11, right = h + s*3 = -18 +18=0, so [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=4, T=9, left = -29 +24= -5, right = -18 +24=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=2, T=7, left = -29 +12= -17, right = -18 +12= -6, [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nAt Δt=5, T=10, left = -29 +30=1, right = -18 +30=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo yes, collision at Δt=3 and 4, T=8 and 9.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2, τ=-29, h=-18, s=6, so same, collision at Δt=3 and 4.\n\nFreeway 4: same, Δt=3 and 4.\n\nFreeway 5: same, Δt=3 and 4.\n\nFreeway 6: τ=-47, h=-12, s=36\n\nU_k = -h/s = -(-12)/36 = 12/36 = 1/3 ≈0.333\n\nL_k = -τ/s = -(-47)/36 = 47/36 ≈1.3056\n\nΔt >= ceil(U_k) = ceil(0.333) =1\n\nΔt <= floor(L_k) = floor(1.3056) =1\n\nSo Δt=1 only.\n\nAt Δt=0, T=5, left=-47, right=-12, 0 not in.\n\nΔt=1, T=6, left=-47+36= -11, right=-12+36=24, [-11,24], 0 in.\n\nΔt=2, T=7, left=-47+72=25, right=-12+72=60, [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at Δt=1.\n\nFreeway 7: τ=-47, h=0, s=48\n\nU_k = -h/s = -0/48 =0\n\nL_k = -τ/s = -(-47)/48 =47/48≈0.979\n\nΔt >= ceil(U_k) = ceil(0) =0\n\nΔt <= floor(L_k) = floor(0.979) =0\n\nSo Δt=0 only.\n\nAt Δt=0, T=5, left= τ + s*0 = -47, right= h + s*0 =0, so [-47,0], 0 is included since <= right.\n\nAt Δt=1, T=6, left= -47+48=1, right=0+48=48, [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at Δt=0.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7, collision only at Δt=0, T=5.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, unsafe at Δt:\n\n- k=1: unsafe at Δt=1 (T=6)\n\n- k=2: unsafe at Δt=3,4 (T=8,9)\n\n- k=3: same, Δt=3,4\n\n- k=4: same, Δt=3,4\n\n- k=5: same, Δt=3,4\n\n- k=6: unsafe at Δt=1 (T=6)\n\n- k=7: unsafe at Δt=0 (T=5)\n\n- k=8: unsafe at Δt=0 (T=5)\n\nNow, I am starting at t=0 (global T=5), position y=5.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, so when I am on y=k at turn T, I need to avoid if that k is unsafe at that T.\n\nBut only for k=1 to 8; y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, always safe.\n\nAt turn T, if I am on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nI start at y=5 at T=5.\n\nAt T=5, freeway 7 and 8 are unsafe, but I am on y=5, not on 7 or 8, so I am safe at T=5.\n\ny=5 is freeway 5, which is unsafe only at Δt=3 and 4, T=8 and 9, not now.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be small, since from y=5 to y=9, I can go up in 4 steps: U,U,U,U.\n\nBut I need to check if I can be on each y at safe times.\n\nSince I start at y=5, and go up, I will be on y=6,7,8, etc.\n\nLet me see the path.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions that gets me to y=9 without being on an unsafe freeway at unsafe times.\n\nDefine the time steps.\n\nSet t=0: turn T= t1 + 0 =5, position y=5\n\nAfter action a_5, y_6 = y_5 + Δy\n\nThen at turn T=6, position y_6, and so on.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y changes by at most 1 per turn, from y=5 to y=9, minimum 4 steps to increase by 4.\n\nSo H >=4, meaning after 4 actions, at turn t1+4=9, position y_9.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, from t=0 to H-1, so at turn t1 + H, position should be 9.\n\nFor example, if H=4, actions at t=0,1,2,3 (T=5,6,7,8), position at T=6,7,8,9.\n\nAt T=9, position y_9 should be 9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nFirst, can I go directly up?\n\nSuppose I do U at every step.\n\nStart: T=5, y=5, safe as above.\n\na_5 = U, so y_6 = 5 +1 =6\n\nAt T=6, position y=6.\n\nNow, freeway 6 is unsafe at T=6 (since Δt=1), so if I am on y=6 at T=6, collision.\n\nYes, so I cannot be on y=6 at T=6.\n\nIf I go U to y=6 at T=6, I collide.\n\nSo I need to avoid that.\n\nI could stay or go down, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince y=6 is unsafe only at T=6, it might be safe at other times.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway k, the unsafe times in terms of global T or Δt.\n\nSince t1=5, Δt = T - 5.\n\nUnsafe Δt:\n\nk=1: Δt=1 (T=6)\n\nk=2: Δt=3,4 (T=8,9)\n\nk=3: Δt=3,4 (T=8,9)\n\nk=4: Δt=3,4 (T=8,9)\n\nk=5: Δt=3,4 (T=8,9)\n\nk=6: Δt=1 (T=6)\n\nk=7: Δt=0 (T=5)\n\nk=8: Δt=0 (T=5)\n\ny=7 and y=8 are unsafe only at T=5, which is past, so at later times, they are safe.\n\ny=7: freeway 7 unsafe only at Δt=0, T=5. For T>5, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 unsafe only at T=5.\n\ny=6 unsafe only at T=6.\n\ny=5 unsafe at T=8 and 9.\n\ny=4 unsafe at T=8 and 9? y=4 is freeway 4, which is unsafe at Δt=3,4, T=8,9.\n\nSimilarly y=3,2,1.\n\nBut I need to go up, so probably not going down.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI need to go from y=5 to y=9.\n\nAt T=5, y=5, safe.\n\nI cannot go to y=6 at T=6 because it would be on y=6 at T=6, unsafe.\n\nSo I must not be on y=6 at T=6.\n\nOptions: I could stay at y=5, or go down to y=4, or even up but that causes collision.\n\nIf I go up to y=6 at T=6, collision, so I should not do U at T=5.\n\nI could do S or D.\n\nIf I do S at T=5, then y_6 =5, so at T=6, I am on y=5.\n\nIs y=5 safe at T=6?\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe at T=8 and 9, not at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, Δt=1, for k=5, unsafe only at Δt=3,4, so at Δt=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all freeways except k=1 and k=6 are unsafe at specific times.\n\nk=1 unsafe at T=6, k=6 at T=6.\n\nBut y=5 is not unsafe at T=6.\n\nSo if I stay at y=5 at T=6, I am safe.\n\nThen at T=6, position y=6? No.\n\nAt T=6, after action at T=5.\n\nSequence:\n\nAt turn T=5: position y=5, I choose action a_5.\n\nIf a_5 = S, then y_6 =5, so at turn T=6, I am at y=5.\n\nThen I am on freeway y=5 at T=6.\n\nAs above, y=5 is safe at T=6, since unsafe only at T=8,9.\n\nSimilarly, if a_5 = D, y_6=4, at T=6 on y=4, which is freeway 4, unsafe only at T=8,9, so safe at T=6.\n\nBut going down might not be efficient.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=6 is unsafe only at T=6, so if I can be on y=6 at other times, it might be ok.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and y=8 are safe for T>5.\n\ny=7 and y=8 unsafe only at T=5, so for T=6 onwards, safe.\n\ny=6 unsafe only at T=6, so for T=7 onwards, safe? At T=7, Δt=2, for k=6, unsafe only at Δt=1, so at Δt=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 unsafe at T=8,9.\n\nNow, let's think about moving up.\n\nI need to get to y=6, but not at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to y=7 or y=8 later.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are safe after T=5, I can go to them anytime except at T=5, but T=5 is past.\n\nNow, from y=5, if I go up to y=6 at T=6, collision.\n\nSo I must delay going to y=6.\n\nOne way: stay at y=5 for one turn.\n\nSo at T=5, a_5 = S, then y_6 =5, at T=6 I am on y=5, safe.\n\nThen at T=6, I can go up to y=6.\n\na_6 = U, then y_7 =6? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T=6, position y=6? No.\n\nAt turn T=6, I am at position y_6.\n\nAfter a_6, y_7 is set.\n\nAt T=6, position y=5 (since I stayed).\n\nI choose a_6.\n\nIf a_6 = U, then y_7 = y_6 +1 =5+1=6.\n\nSo at turn T=7, I am at y=7? y_7=6.\n\nPosition at T=7 is y_7=6.\n\nNow, at T=7, y=6, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe only at T=6, not at T=7. At T=7, Δt=2, safe for y=6.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways, no issue.\n\nThen at T=7, I can go up to y=7.\n\na_7 = U, then y_8 =7.\n\nAt T=8, position y=8? y_8=7? Let's list:\n\nTurn T=7: position y_7=6\n\nAction a_7 = U, so y_8 =6+1=7\n\nAt turn T=8, position y_8=7\n\nNow, y=7 is freeway 7, which is safe at T=8, since unsafe only at T=5.\n\nThen at T=8, I can go up to y=8.\n\na_8 = U, then y_9 =7+1=8\n\nAt turn T=9, position y_9=8\n\nThen I need to go to y=9.\n\na_9 = U, then y_10 =8+1=9\n\nAt turn T=10, position y_10=9.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9, so at T=10, y=9.\n\nNow, at T=9, I was at y=8, which is freeway 8.\n\nIs y=8 safe at T=9?\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe only at Δt=0, T=5, so at T=9, Δt=4, safe.\n\nIn this sequence, I reached y=9 at T=10.\n\nBut let's see the actions and positions.\n\nStart: T=5, y=5\n\na_5 = S, so y_6 =5 (stay)\n\nThen T=6, position y=5\n\na_6 = U, so y_7 =6\n\nT=7, position y=6\n\na_7 = U, so y_8 =7\n\nT=8, position y=7\n\na_8 = U, so y_9 =8\n\nT=9, position y=8\n\na_9 = U, so y_10 =9\n\nT=10, position y=9\n\nSo I reached at T=10, with H=5 actions? H is the number of turns from t1, I think.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so actions at T=5 to T=5+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position should be 9.\n\nIn this case, after 5 actions: actions at T=5,6,7,8,9, position at T=10 is 9.\n\nSo H=5.\n\nBut is it minimal? I could do better.\n\nNotice that y=7 and y=8 are safe after T=5, so I could go directly to them if possible.\n\nBut from y=5, to go to y=7, I need two steps, but at T=6, y=6 is unsafe if I go through it.\n\nI could stay or something.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 is only unsafe at T=6, I can be on y=6 at T=7 or later.\n\nIn the above, I was on y=6 at T=7, which is safe.\n\nBut I took an extra turn by staying.\n\nCan I go to y=7 directly? No, because to go from y=5 to y=7, I must pass through y=6 at some point.\n\nFor example, if I do U at T=5, y_6=6, but at T=6, on y=6, collision.\n\nIf I do nothing, stay, then go later.\n\nBut I need to be on y=6 at a time other than T=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 is unsafe at T=8 and 9, so I should not be on y=5 at T=8 or 9.\n\nIn the above sequence, I was on y=5 at T=6, which is safe, and off by T=8.\n\nT=6 is before T=8.\n\nNow, can I reach faster?\n\nSuppose at T=5, I go down to y=4? But that seems counterproductive.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, unsafe at T=8,9, but safe now.\n\nBut going down might take more turns.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nPerhaps I can go up but skip the unsafe time.\n\nAnother thought: since I need to avoid y=6 at T=6, I could go to y=6 at T=7.\n\nBut to be at y=6 at T=7, I need to have y_7=6.\n\ny_7 depends on action at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, position y_6, then a_6 determines y_7.\n\nTo have y_7=6, I need to be at y=5 or y=6 or y=7 at T=6, and choose action accordingly.\n\nIf at T=6, I am at y=5, I can do U to go to y=6 at T=7.\n\nIf at y=6, do S to stay at y=6 at T=7.\n\nIf at y=7, do D to go down to y=6 at T=7.\n\nBut going down is inefficient.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=6 at T=7, I need to be at T=6 on some y.\n\nNow, at T=5, I start at y=5.\n\nIf I do S at T=5, then at T=6, y=5, then I can do U to have y_7=6.\n\nIf I do U at T=5, y_6=6, but at T=6 on y=6, collision, not possible.\n\nIf I do D at T=5, y_6=4, then at T=6 on y=4, which is safe, then I can go up to y_7=5 or something, not directly to y=6.\n\nTo have y_7=6 from y=4, I need two steps: e.g., U to y=5 at T=7, then U to y=6 at T=8, but slower.\n\nSo best is to stay at T=5, then go to y=6 at T=7.\n\nNow, similarly, from there, I can go to y=7,8,9.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 are safe, so I can go quickly.\n\nIn the earlier sequence, I went from y=6 at T=7 to y=7 at T=8 to y=8 at T=9 to y=9 at T=10.\n\nBut I can go faster from y=6.\n\nAt T=7, I am at y=6.\n\nI can do U to go to y=7 at T=8.\n\nBut I could do U twice quickly, but y changes slowly.\n\nAnother idea: can I be on y=7 at T=7?\n\nAt T=7, position y_7.\n\nTo have y_7=7, I need to have come from y=6 or y=7 or y=8 at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, where can I be?\n\nAt T=6, I need to be on a safe y.\n\nPossible safe y at T=6.\n\ny=0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9 are freeways? y=0 and y=9 no freeway, always safe.\n\ny=1 to 8 freeways.\n\nAt T=6, unsafe freeways: from above, k=1 and k=6 are unsafe at T=6.\n\nk=1: y=1, unsafe at T=6\n\nk=6: y=6, unsafe at T=6\n\nOthers are safe at T=6.\n\ny=2,3,4,5,7,8 are safe at T=6.\n\ny=7 and y=8 safe since T>5.\n\ny=5 safe, as earlier.\n\nNow, at T=6, I can be on y=5, as before.\n\nBut if I want to be at y=7 at T=7, I need to be at y=6 or y=7 or y=8 at T=6.\n\nBut at T=6, y=6 is unsafe, so I cannot be on y=6 at T=6.\n\ny=7 is safe at T=6, so I could be on y=7 at T=6, then do S to stay at y=7 at T=7, or U to y=8, etc.\n\nBut how to be on y=7 at T=6?\n\nAt T=5, I am at y=5.\n\nIf I do U at T=5, I go to y=6 at T=6, but collision, not possible.\n\nIf I do nothing, I stay at y=5 at T=6.\n\nTo be at y=7 at T=6, I need to have come from below or above.\n\nBut from y=5 at T=5, I can only go to y=4,5,6 at T=6, not directly to y=7.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=7 at T=6 from start.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be at y=8 or others.\n\nSo at T=6, possible positions: y=4,5,7,8,9, etc., but y=7,8,9 may not be reachable from y=5 in one step.\n\nFrom y=5 at T=5, with one action, y_6 can be 4,5,6.\n\nBut y=6 unsafe, so only y=4 or y=5 at T=6.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\nBut to reach y=9 fast, I need to go up.\n\nIn the sequence I had, with stay at start, I reached y=9 at T=10 with 5 actions.\n\nBut perhaps I can go to y=9 faster.\n\nMinimal turns: since from y=5 to y=9, delta y=4, I need at least 4 actions if I go up each time.\n\nBut with the constraint, I might need more.\n\nWith 4 actions: actions at T=5,6,7,8, position at T=9 should be y=9.\n\nSo y_9=9.\n\nNow, y_9 depends on previous.\n\ny_9 = y_8 + a_8 effect.\n\nTo have y_9=9, y_8 must be 8 or 9, and action accordingly.\n\nSimilarly, I need to reach y=8 at T=8 or something.\n\nNow, positions at each turn.\n\nAt T=5, y=5\n\nThen after a_5, y_6\n\nAt T=6, y_6\n\nAfter a_6, y_7\n\nT=7, y_7\n\na_7, y_8\n\nT=8, y_8\n\na_8, y_9\n\nT=9, y_9=9\n\nNow, for y_9=9, since y=9, no issue, but I need to be on the way.\n\nConstraints: at each turn T, when on y=1 to 8, must not be unsafe time.\n\nUnsafe times:\n\nT=5: unsafe y=7,8\n\nBut at T=5, I am on y=5, safe.\n\nT=6: unsafe y=1 and y=6\n\nT=7: no unsafe, all safe? Let's list for each T the unsafe y.\n\nAt T=5: unsafe y=7 and y=8 (from freeway 7 and 8)\n\nAt T=6: unsafe y=1 and y=6 (freeway 1 and 6)\n\nAt T=7: freeway 1 unsafe only at T=6, freeway 6 at T=6, freeway 2,3,4,5 at T=8,9, not T=7, freeway 7 and 8 only T=5. So at T=7, all freeways safe, no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, T=8: unsafe y=2,3,4,5 (freeway 2,3,4,5 at T=8)\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5 unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway 1,6,7,8 safe at T=8.\n\nT=9: unsafe y=2,3,4,5\n\nNow back to 4-action plan.\n\nI need y_9=9.\n\ny_9 = y_8 + delta from a_8.\n\nIf a_8 = U, y_9 = y_8 +1\n\nSince y_9=9, y_8 must be 8.\n\nSimilarly, if a_8=S, y_9=y_8, so must be 9, but y_8=9, then a_8=S, but I need to reach 9, so if y_8=9, I can do S or D, but D goes down, not good, so if y_8=9, I can do S to stay.\n\nBut to minimize, probably better to reach exactly.\n\nSimilarly, if y_8=8, do U to 9.\n\nNow, similarly, y_8 must be safe at T=8.\n\ny_8 is at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, unsafe y=2,3,4,5.\n\ny=1,6,7,8,9 are safe? y=1: freeway 1 unsafe only at T=6, so at T=8 safe.\n\ny=6: freeway 6 unsafe only at T=6, safe at T=8.\n\ny=7: safe.\n\ny=8: safe.\n\ny=9: safe.\n\ny=2,3,4,5 unsafe.\n\nSo at T=8, y_8 must be one of 1,6,7,8,9 to be safe.\n\nBut since we want to go to 9, probably y_8=8 or 9.\n\nNow, similarly, y_8 depends on y_7 and a_7.\n\nNow, at T=7, all positions are safe, as we said.\n\nNow, y_7 can be from 0 to 9.\n\nNow, to have y_8=8, for example.\n\nIf y_7=7, a_7=U, y_8=8\n\nOr y_7=8, a_7=S, y_8=8\n\nOr y_7=9, a_7=D, but inefficient.\n\nSimilarly, y_8=9: if y_7=8, a_7=U, y_8=9? y_8 = y_7 + delta from a_7.\n\na_7 at T=7 affects y_8.\n\ny_8 position at T=8.\n\nNow, similarly, y_7 at T=7.\n\nNow, let's go back to start.\n\nAt T=5, y_5=5\n\na_5: can be U, D, S.\n\nIf a_5=U, y_6=6, but at T=6, y=6 unsafe, collision, not possible.\n\nSo a_5 cannot be U.\n\nIf a_5=D, y_6=4, at T=6 on y=4.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, at T=6, is it safe? T=6, unsafe y=1 and 6, so y=4 safe.\n\nThen at T=6, position y=4.\n\nThen a_6: can go to y=3,4,5.\n\nBut we want to go up.\n\nIf a_6=U, y_7=5\n\nThen at T=7, position y=5? y_7=5.\n\nT=7 all safe.\n\nThen from here, to reach y=9 at T=9.\n\ny_7=5\n\nThen a_7: to y=4,5,6.\n\nIf a_7=U, y_8=6\n\nAt T=8, position y=6, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen a_8: to y=5,6,7.\n\nIf a_8=U, y_9=7, but we need y_9=9, not 7.\n\ny_9=7, too low.\n\nIf a_7=U to y_8=6, then a_8=U to y_9=7, still not 9.\n\nFrom y_7=5, if a_7=U to y_8=6, then to go to y=9, I need two more steps, but at T=9, I am at y=7 or something.\n\nAfter a_8, y_9, at T=9.\n\nWith y_7=5 at T=7.\n\nIf a_7=U, y_8=6\n\nThen a_8=U, y_9=7\n\nThen at T=9, y=7, not 9.\n\nIf I do U twice, but y_8=6, y_9=7.\n\nTo reach higher, from y_7=5, I need to have gone up earlier.\n\nBut I came from below.\n\nIn this path: a_5=D to y_6=4, a_6=U to y_7=5, then I am at y=5 at T=7.\n\nBut at T=8, y=5 is unsafe! Because freeway 5 unsafe at T=8.\n\nIf I am on y=5 at T=8, collision.\n\nIn this case, at T=8, y_8=6 if I go U from y_7=5.\n\ny_7=5 at T=7, a_7=U, y_8=6, at T=8 position y=6, which is safe.\n\nThen a_8=U, y_9=7, at T=9 y=7.\n\nBut I need y=9, so not reached.\n\nIf from y_7=5, I do U twice, but I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\na_7=U, y_8=6\n\na_8=U, y_9=7\n\ny=7 at T=9.\n\nBut to get to y=9, I need to go to y=8 then y=9, but at T=9, I am at y=7, so I need more turns.\n\nNot with 4 actions.\n\nIf at y_7=5, I do nothing, a_7=S, y_8=5, but at T=8, y=5 unsafe, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf a_7=D, worse.\n\nSo from this path, not possible to reach y=9 in 4 actions.\n\nNow, back to a_5=S.\n\na_5=S, y_6=5, at T=6 position y=5, safe.\n\nThen at T=6, a_6: can be U, D, S.\n\nIf a_6=U, y_7=6, as before.\n\nThen at T=7, y=6, safe.\n\nNow, from here, to reach y=9 at T=9.\n\ny_7=6 at T=7.\n\na_7: to y=5,6,7.\n\nIf a_7=U, y_8=7\n\nAt T=8, position y=7, safe.\n\nThen a_8: to y=6,7,8.\n\nIf a_8=U, y_9=8\n\nThen at T=9, y=8, not 9.\n\nIf a_8=S, y_9=7, worse.\n\ny_9=8, then I need another action to go to 9.\n\nBut with 4 actions, I have actions up to a_8, y_9 is set.\n\nTo have y_9=9, I need y_8=8 and a_8=U, or y_8=9 and a_8=S.\n\nBut at T=8, y=8 is safe, as above.\n\nBut how to have y_8=8.\n\nFrom y_7=6 at T=7, if a_7=U, y_8=7, not 8.\n\nIf I could be at y=7 at T=7, then a_7=U, y_8=8.\n\nBut at T=7, y_7=6, not 7.\n\nTo have y_7=7, I need to have come from earlier.\n\nBut at T=6, I was at y=5.\n\nIf at T=6, I could go to y=7, but I can't, because from y=5, a_6=U would go to y=6, but unsafe, or a_6=S to y=5, or D to y=4.\n\nNo way to go to y=7 directly.\n\nSo impossible to have y_7=7 with this start.\n\nThus, with a_5=S and a_6=U, y_7=6, then I can only get to y_8=7 or less at T=8, so y_9=8 or less, not 9.\n\nWith 4 actions, I cannot reach y=9.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is at least 5.\n\nNow, with H=5, as in the first sequence, I can reach.\n\nIn that sequence: actions at T=5,6,7,8,9, position at T=10 is 9.\n\nBut in the sequence, I had a_9=U to go from y=8 to y=9.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nAt T=9, I could be at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=9, I was at y=8.\n\nBut if I can be at y=9 at T=9.\n\nNow, with H=5 actions, from T=5 to T=9, position at T=10.\n\nThe turn when position is 9 is T=10.\n\nBut I need the position to be 9 at some turn after actions.\n\nPerhaps I can have position at T=9 to be 9.\n\nFor that, with actions starting from T=5.\n\nActions a_5 to a_9, for H=5 actions, at T=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nAfter a_9, position at T=10.\n\nTo have position at T=9, I need after actions up to a_8.\n\nFor example, if I have H=4 actions, at T=5,6,7,8, position at T=9 should be 9.\n\nBut we saw it's impossible.\n\nWith H=5, position at T=10 is 9.\n\nBut perhaps I can have position at T=9 to be 9 with H=4, but we can't.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose I go to y=7 or y=8 earlier.\n\nBut from y=5, I need to go through y=6.\n\ny=6 is only blocked at T=6.\n\nSo I have to avoid T=6 for y=6.\n\nThus, I must not be on y=6 at T=6, so I need to be on it at another time.\n\nThe earliest I can be on y=6 is T=7.\n\nThen from there, I can go to y=7 at T=8, y=8 at T=9, y=9 at T=10.\n\nAs before.\n\nCan I go to y=7 at T=7?\n\nTo be at y=7 at T=7.\n\nAt T=7, position y_7=7.\n\ny_7 depends on a_6 and y_6.\n\ny_6 at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, I can be on y=5 (if I stayed or came from below), or y=7 if I came from above, but I started at y=5, so from below, I can only reach y=4,5 at T=6 if I went down or stayed, but not y=7.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=7 at T=7.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be at y=8 at T=8 directly.\n\nSo the sequence I have seems optimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the positions and times.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n- T=5: position y=5, safe. Action a_5 = S (stay)\n\n- T=6: position y=5 (since stayed), safe. Action a_6 = U (up)\n\n- T=7: position y=6 (since up from 5), and at T=7, y=6 safe. Action a_7 = U\n\n- T=8: position y=7, safe (y=7 safe after T=5). Action a_8 = U\n\n- T=9: position y=8, safe (y=8 safe after T=5). Action a_9 = U\n\n- T=10: position y=9, reached.\n\nNow, at T=9, position y=8, which is freeway 8, but safe as above.\n\nAnd I used 5 actions: at T=5 to T=9.\n\nH=5.\n\nBut is there a way with H=4? We thought not.\n\nPerhaps I can go down first or something, but that would take more turns, not less.\n\nFor example, at T=5, go down to y=4, then I need even more steps to go up.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo H=5 seems minimal.\n\nIn the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nThe sequence: a_5 = S, a_6 = U, a_7 = U, a_8 = U, a_9 = U\n\nBut a_9 is at T=9, and after that at T=10 y=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, from t=0 to H-1, with t=0 for T=t1=5.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions starting from turn t1.\n\nSo for t1=5, actions from a_5 to a_{5+H-1}\n\nIn this case H=5, so actions a_5, a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9.\n\nWith values S, U, U, U, U.\n\nBut at T=9, I do U to go to y=9.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, I was on y=5 at T=6, which is safe, and no issue.\n\nBut let me check if at any point I was on unsafe.\n\nT=5: y=5, safe\n\nT=6: y=5, safe (unsafe only T=8,9)\n\nT=7: y=6, safe (unsafe only T=6)\n\nT=8: y=7, safe\n\nT=9: y=8, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, but I need to reach (0,9), which is at T=10.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at T=9.\n\nHow?\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=9.\n\nThen I need to have y_9=9.\n\ny_9 is position at T=9.\n\nWith actions from T=5 to T=8, for H=4 actions.\n\nBut we saw it's impossible.\n\nSuppose I go to y=9 directly, but I have to go through intermediates.\n\nAnother idea: since y=9 is always safe, I could be there early, but I start from below.\n\nFor example, if I can jump, but no, only change by 1.\n\nSo I think H=5 is minimal.\n\nBut let me see if I can save a turn by going to a safe zone faster.\n\nNotice that at T=7, all are safe, so I could, for example, from y=5 at T=6, go up to y=6 at T=7, but same as before.\n\nAt T=6, I am at y=5, I can go up to y=6 at T=7.\n\nThen at T=7, y=6, I can go up to y=7 at T=8, then to y=8 at T=9, then to y=9 at T=10.\n\nSame as before.\n\nFrom y=6 at T=7, I can only go to y=7 at T=8, not faster.\n\nUnless I am higher at T=7.\n\nBut I can't.\n\nPerhaps I can use the fact that y=0 or y=9 are safe, but going down to y=0 is worse.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, but in the car state, freeway 6 has s=36, which is high, but we handled.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 7 and 8, at T=5, head at 0, so if I were on y=7 or 8 at T=5, collision, but I am not.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nAfter that, at turn 10, position (0,9)\n\nBut the sequence is up to turn t1 + H-1 = 5 + 4 =9? H=5, t1=5, actions from t=0 to 4, T=5 to 9.\n\nIn the box, it should be:\n\nTurn 5: a_5\n\nTurn 6: a_6\n\n...\n\nTurn 9: a_9\n\nWith a_5=S, a_6=U, a_7=U, a_8=U, a_9=U\n\nBut let me write the actions clearly.\n\nPerhaps I can have a different sequence.\n\nSuppose at T=5, I do nothing, S.\n\nThen at T=6, instead of going up, I could go down, but that would be slower.\n\nNo.\n\nOr, at T=6, I stay again, but then I am on y=5 at later times.\n\nFor example, if at T=6, I do S, y_7=5, at T=7 position y=5, safe.\n\nThen at T=7, I can go U to y=6 at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, position y=6, safe.\n\nThen a_8=U to y=7 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, position y=7.\n\nThen a_9=U to y=8 at T=10.\n\nThen I need another action to y=9, so worse.\n\nThus, the first sequence is better.\n\nGo up immediately after the stay.\n\nSo I think it's optimal.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=5.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 5: S Turn 6: U Turn 7: U Turn 8: U Turn 9: U }\n\nIn the box, it should be written as such.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbers.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=5.\n\nActions for turn 5 to turn 9.\n\nIn the sequence, it's from t=0 to H-1, with H=5, so turns 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should write it clearly.\n\nSince the player position at turn T is before action, but in the update, after action.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo the minimal sequence is stay, then up four times.\n\nBut in terms of actions, S, then U,U,U,U.\n\nWith positions: after S, y=5 at T=6; after first U, y=6 at T=7; etc.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined to be optimal, requiring \\(H = 5\\) turns (actions from turn 5 to turn 9).\n\n### Analysis of Car Collisions\nThe car states at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) and their unsafe times (when the car span includes \\(x=0\\)) are as follows:\n\n- **Freeway 1 (\\(y=1\\))**: Unsafe at \\(\\Delta t = 1\\) (global turn \\(T = 6\\)).\n- **Freeway 2 (\\(y=2\\))**: Unsafe at \\(\\Delta t = 3, 4\\) (global turns \\(T = 8, 9\\)).\n- **Freeway 3 (\\(y=3\\))**: Unsafe at \\(\\Delta t = 3, 4\\) (global turns \\(T = 8, 9\\)).\n- **Freeway 4 (\\(y=4\\))**: Unsafe at \\(\\Delta t = 3, 4\\) (global turns \\(T = 8, 9\\)).\n- **Freeway 5 (\\(y=5\\))**: Unsafe at \\(\\Delta t = 3, 4\\) (global turns \\(T = 8, 9\\)).\n- **Freeway 6 (\\(y=6\\))**: Unsafe at \\(\\Delta t = 1\\) (global turn \\(T = 6\\)).\n- **Freeway 7 (\\(y=7\\))**: Unsafe at \\(\\Delta t = 0\\) (global turn \\(T = 5\\)).\n- **Freeway 8 (\\(y=8\\))**: Unsafe at \\(\\Delta t = 0\\) (global turn \\(T = 5\\)).\n\nWhere \\(\\Delta t = T - t_1 = T - 5\\).\n\nCollision occurs only if the player is on a freeway \\(y = k\\) (for \\(k = 1\\) to \\(8\\)) at a turn \\(T\\) when that freeway is unsafe. Positions \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) are always safe as they have no cars.\n\n### Path to Reach \\(y = 9\\)\n- The player starts at \\(y = 5\\) at turn \\(T = 5\\). Freeway 5 is safe at \\(T = 5\\) (unsafe only at \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 9\\)).\n- Moving up directly to \\(y = 6\\) at \\(T = 6\\) causes a collision because freeway 6 is unsafe at \\(T = 6\\).\n- To avoid this, the player must stay at \\(y = 5\\) for turn \\(T = 6\\) by choosing action \\(S\\) at turn 5. At \\(T = 6\\), \\(y = 5\\) is safe (freeway 5 unsafe only at \\(T = 8, 9\\)).\n- From \\(y = 5\\) at \\(T = 6\\), moving up to \\(y = 6\\) at \\(T = 7\\) is safe, as freeway 6 is only unsafe at \\(T = 6\\).\n- Then, moving up to \\(y = 7\\) at \\(T = 8\\), \\(y = 8\\) at \\(T = 9\\), and finally \\(y = 9\\) at \\(T = 10\\) is safe, as freeways 7 and 8 are only unsafe at \\(T = 5\\), and \\(y = 9\\) is always safe.\n\nThis sequence uses 5 actions (turns 5 to 9) and reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 10. A sequence with fewer than 5 actions (e.g., 4 actions) is impossible because:\n- With 4 actions (turns 5 to 8), the position at turn 9 (\\(T = 9\\)) must be \\(y = 9\\).\n- However, starting from \\(y = 5\\) at \\(T = 5\\), it is impossible to reach \\(y = 9\\) by \\(T = 9\\) while avoiding unsafe positions (e.g., \\(y = 6\\) at \\(T = 6\\) causes collision, and delays are needed).\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe minimal sequence of actions, with \\(H = 5\\), is:\n\n- At turn 5, stay (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 5\\) for turn 6, avoiding \\(y = 6\\) at unsafe \\(T = 6\\).\n- At turn 6, move up (\\(U\\)) to reach \\(y = 6\\) for turn 7.\n- At turn 7, move up (\\(U\\)) to reach \\(y = 7\\) for turn 8.\n- At turn 8, move up (\\(U\\)) to reach \\(y = 8\\) for turn 9.\n- At turn 9, move up (\\(U\\)) to reach \\(y = 9\\) for turn 10.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and reaches the goal in the minimal number of turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} }",

The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe car update rules:\n- For a car on freeway i, we are given (head, tail, direction, speed) at turn t1=6.\n- Note: The representation for left-moving and right-moving is given. However, note that the table gives:\n  - For freeway 1: (0, -11, right, 12) -> meaning it is right-moving. So at turn T, the span becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]? \n  But wait: the update rule says:\n    Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, head] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\n  However, in the input for freeway 1: (head, tail) = (0, -11) and direction right. So we must interpret the given pair as (head, tail) and for right-moving, the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-11, 0]? \n  But note: the update rule says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then moves to [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\n  The problem states: \"For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at tau at turn t1\". Then for right-moving, the span at t1 is [tau, h]? But in the table, it's written as (head, tail) = (0, -11). So if it's right-moving, then the head is the front? and the tail is the back? So the car extends from tail to head? Then the span at t1 is [tau, h] = [-11, 0].\n\n  Similarly, for left-moving: the update rule says: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. But note: the input for left-moving would have head and tail? and the span would be [h, tau] meaning from head to tail? But the example only has right-moving cars.\n\n  Let me clarify the given cars:\n\n  All cars are right-moving? because direction is \"right\". So for each car, the span at turn t1 is [tail, head] (with tail <= head).\n\n  So for freeway 1: at t1=6, the car spans [-11, 0].\n  Then at a future turn T (>=6), the car will be at [tail + s*(T-6), head + s*(T-6)] = [-11 + 12*(T-6), 0 + 12*(T-6)].\n\n  Similarly for others.\n\n  Important: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, the player's x=0 is inside the span of any car on that freeway at the same turn T.\n\n  Also note: when moving from freeway y to y+1 (by action U) at turn T, then at turn T the player is still on freeway y. Then at turn T+1, the player moves to y+1. So the freeway at turn T is the starting freeway.\n\n  Similarly for moving down.\n\n  We start at turn t1=6 at y=5. We want to get to y=9. Note that y=9 is the goal and there are no cars on y=9 (since cars are only on y=1..8). So once we reach y=9 we are safe.\n\n  The minimal number of turns? The minimal steps in terms of vertical moves: we are at 5, we need to go to 9 -> 4 steps up. But we have to avoid the cars on the freeways we step on. However, we might have to wait (use S) to avoid a car.\n\n  We need to plan the sequence of actions (U, D, S) for turns starting at t=6 (the current turn) until we land on 9.\n\n  We must avoid being on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T if there is a car on that freeway at turn T such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\n  We are only concerned with the freeways we are on at each turn.\n\n  Since we start at y=5 at turn 6, we are on freeway 5 at turn 6? Actually, the freeways are y=1,2,...,8. The player is at (0,5) at turn 6, so we are on freeway 5.\n\n  We must check for each freeway we step on at each turn.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  We are going to simulate from turn 6 onward. We are at y=5 at turn 6.\n\n  We want the minimal H (number of turns) so that at turn t1+H-1 = 6+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\n  The actions we take: at turn 6 we take a_6, then at turn 7 a_7, ... until we reach 9.\n\n  How many actions? We need at least 4 U actions. But we might have to use S to wait, or even D to go back? But going back might be counterproductive. However, we are to minimize H, so we want to get there as fast as possible.\n\n  Let me compute the car positions at future turns.\n\n  We'll denote the car on freeway k at turn T (T>=6) as:\n\n    For a right-moving car: \n        tail_T = tail_0 + s*(T-6)\n        head_T = head_0 + s*(T-6)\n\n    where (head_0, tail_0) are the values at turn 6.\n\n  The cars:\n\n  Freeway 1: (head_0, tail_0, d, s) = (0, -11, right, 12)\n      T=6: span = [-11, 0]\n      T=7: [-11+12=1, 0+12=12]\n      T=8: [13,24]\n      T=9: [25,36]\n      ... \n\n  Freeway 2: (-12, -23, right, 6) -> at T=6: [-23, -12]\n      T=7: [-23+6=-17, -12+6=-6]\n      T=8: [-11, 0]\n      T=9: [-5, 6]\n      T=10: [1,12]\n      T=11: [7,18]\n      T=12: [13,24]\n\n  Similarly, freeways 3,4,5 are the same as freeway 2? \n      Freeway 3: (-12, -23, right, 6) -> same as freeway 2?\n      Freeway 4: same\n      Freeway 5: same\n\n  Freeway 6: (24, -11, right, 36) -> note: head=24, tail=-11? Then at T=6: span = [-11, 24] (since right-moving: [tail, head] = [-11,24])\n      T=7: [-11+36=25, 24+36=60]\n      T=8: [61,96]\n      ... \n\n  But wait: the representation says (head, tail) and for right-moving the span is [tail, head]. So for freeway 6: tail=-11, head=24 -> so the car is from -11 to 24? That is a very long car? But note the speed is 36, so it moves fast.\n\n  Freeway 7: (48, 1, right, 48) -> at T=6: [1,48]? Actually: the input is (head, tail) = (48,1) -> so tail=1, head=48? Then the car at T=6: [1,48]? \n      Then T=7: [1+48=49, 48+48=96]\n      T=8: [97, 144]\n\n  Freeway 8: same as freeway 7: [1,48] at T=6, then T=7: [49,96], etc.\n\n  Now, we are at turn 6, y=5. We must check the car on freeway 5 at turn 6.\n\n  Freeway 5: same as freeway 2: at T=6: [-23, -12] -> does 0 lie in [-23,-12]? No. So we are safe at turn 6.\n\n  We need to plan the next moves.\n\n  We can do:\n\n    Option 1: Go up at turn 6: then at turn 7 we are at y=6. Then we must check freeway 6 at turn 7? \n        Actually, at turn 6 we are on freeway 5 (because we are at y=5). Then we take U: at turn 7 we are at y=6. So at turn 7, we are on freeway 6.\n\n    For freeway 6 at turn 7: [25,60] -> 0 is not in [25,60] -> safe.\n\n    Then at turn 7 we can go up again: turn 8 at y=7. Check freeway 7 at turn 8? \n        Freeway 7 at turn 8: [97,144] -> safe.\n\n    Then at turn 8 we go up: turn 9 at y=8. Check freeway 8 at turn 9: \n        Freeway 8 at turn 9: [1 + 48*(9-6) = 1+144=145, 48+144=192] -> safe.\n\n    Then at turn 9 we go up: turn 10 at y=9 -> goal.\n\n    So sequence: U, U, U, U? But wait, we are at turn 6: action U at turn 6 -> turn 7: y=6; turn 7: U -> turn8: y=7; turn8: U -> turn9: y=8; turn9: U -> turn10: y=9. So H=4? Then we have taken 4 actions: turns 6,7,8,9 -> 4 turns? But H is the number of turns? The problem says: a sequence of actions for t from 0 to H-1. Here we have 4 actions: so H=4? Then we end at turn 6+4-1 = 9? Yes: at turn9 we are at y=8, then after the last action at turn9 we become at y=9? \n\n    Actually, the update: at turn T we take action a_T, then we get y_{T+1} = y_T + Delta.\n\n    So at turn 6: we take a_6 -> then at turn 7 we have y_7 = y_6 + Delta_6.\n    Then at turn 7: we take a_7 -> turn8: y8 = y7 + Delta_7.\n    Then at turn8: a8 -> turn9: y9 = y8 + Delta8.\n    Then at turn9: a9 -> turn10: y10 = y9 + Delta9.\n\n    But we want to be at y=9 at turn 6+H-1.\n\n    So if we start at turn6, then after H actions we have taken H steps, and we are at turn 6+H. But the problem says: we are to have a sequence for t=0 to H-1, meaning from t1 (which is 6) to 6+H-1. Then the state at turn 6+H is the result of the last action at turn 6+H-1.\n\n    And we require that at turn 6+H-1 (the last action) we end at y=9? Actually, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\n    But note: the actions are taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. The state after the last action is at turn t1+H. However, the problem states: \"y_{t1+H-1}\" is the position at the end of turn t1+H-1? \n\n    Let me clarify: \n\n        At turn t1 (turn 6): we start at y_6 = 5.\n        Then we take action a_6 -> then we get y_7 = y_6 + Delta_6.\n\n        So after the first action (at turn6) we are at turn7 at y_7.\n\n        Similarly, after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at turn t1+H.\n\n        But the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\" ? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning:\n\n          t=0: a_{t1+0} = a_6\n          t=1: a_{t1+1} = a_7\n          ...\n          t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\n        and we require that at the end of the sequence we are at (0,9), i.e., at turn t1+H we are at y=9? But the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\n        This seems inconsistent. Let me read:\n\n          \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\"\n\n          and then: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\n        But note: the state at the moment we take the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is y_{t1+H-1}. Then we take the last action and get y_{t1+H}. \n\n        However, the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\n        That means we are already at 9 at the beginning of the last action? Then the last action would be S? Or we are already at 9 at the beginning of the last action and then we do nothing? \n\n        But wait: the initial state is at turn t1 (6) at y_6=5. We haven't taken any action. Then we take action at turn6 to get to turn7. \n\n        The requirement: after H actions we have the state at turn t1+H. But the problem says the state at turn t1+H-1 should be 9? \n\n        Let me check the problem statement: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\n        Actually: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\n        So we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? But then we don't need to take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\n        But the sequence of actions goes from t=t1 to t1+H-1. \n\n        Alternatively, note that the state at turn t is the state after the action of turn t-1? \n\n        The problem says: at turn t1 we are at (0,y_{t1}) = (0,5). Then we take an action a_{t1} to get to the next state. \n\n        The state at turn t1+1 is (0, y_{t1+1}) = (0, y_{t1} + Delta_{t1}).\n\n        So the state at turn T is the state after the action taken at turn T-1? \n\n        Actually, the state at turn t1 is the starting state (before any action at turn t1). Then we take an action at turn t1 to get to the next state at turn t1+1.\n\n        Therefore, the state at turn t1 is y_{t1} = 5.\n        After action at turn t1 (a6), we get state at turn t1+1: y_{t1+1} = 5 + Delta.\n\n        So if we take H actions (at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1), then the state after the last action is at turn t1+H.\n\n        And we require that at turn t1+H we are at y=9? But the problem says: y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\n        This seems to be a discrepancy. \n\n        Let me re-read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\n        And then: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\n        This implies that at the beginning of the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at 9? Then the last action must be S? \n\n        But that doesn't make sense because we are already at 9. \n\n        Alternatively, the problem might be defining the state at the end of the turn. \n\n        However, the problem states: \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + ...\". So at the end of turn t, the player is at y_{t}? \n\n        But note: at the beginning of turn t1, we are at y_{t1}=5. Then we take an action at turn t1, and then we update to y_{t1+1}.\n\n        So the state at the end of turn t is y_t? Then we require that at the end of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\n        How many actions? We take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. That is H actions. The last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, which updates the state from y_{t1+H-1} to y_{t1+H}. \n\n        But we require y_{t1+H-1} = 9. So we are at 9 at the end of turn t1+H-1? \n\n        How? Because we start at turn t1: at the end of turn t1 we are still at y_{t1}=5? Then we take the first action at turn t1 to get to y_{t1+1} at the end of turn t1+1? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not explicitly say when the state is updated relative to the turn. But the update equation: y_{t+1} = y_t + ... \n\n        This suggests that the state at time t+1 is computed from the state at time t and the action at time t.\n\n        So the state at time t is the state at the beginning of turn t? Then we take action a_t to get to state at time t+1.\n\n        Therefore, we start at turn t1: state y_{t1}=5. We take action a_{t1} and then we are at state y_{t1+1} at the beginning of turn t1+1? \n\n        But the problem says: the player is at (0,y_t) at turn t. So at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t.\n\n        Then we take action a_t during turn t, and then at the beginning of the next turn (t+1) we are at y_{t+1}.\n\n        So we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\n        Then we don't need to take an action at turn t1+H-1? But the sequence goes up to a_{t1+H-1}. \n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        Let me look at the example in the problem: the answer format: \n\n          Turn t1: a_{t1}\n          Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n          ...\n\n        and the last action is at turn t1+H-1. \n\n        Then the state after that last action is at the beginning of turn t1+H. \n\n        But the problem says: we require y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\n        Therefore, we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n\n        How do we get to 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n\n        We start at turn t1 (beginning) at y=5. Then we take actions at turn t1, t1+1, ... until turn t1+H-2 to get to 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n\n        Then the last action we take is at turn t1+H-2? But the sequence goes to turn t1+H-1. \n\n        Alternatively, the problem might be requiring that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9, and then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? But then we are no longer at 9? \n\n        I think there might be a misunderstanding.\n\n        Let me re-read: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\n        And the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\n        So the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is 9. \n\n        How do we achieve that? \n\n        We take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? Then the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is the result of the last action at turn t1+H-2.\n\n        Then why is the sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1? That would be H actions, but we only took H-1 actions? \n\n        The problem says: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: meaning a_{t1+0}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}. \n\n        So we are taking H actions. The last action is at turn t1+H-1. \n\n        But then the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is the result of the action at turn t1+H-2. \n\n        Then at turn t1+H-1 we take an action, which changes the state to y_{t1+H} (at the beginning of turn t1+H). \n\n        But we require y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\n        Therefore, the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is 9, and then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\n        But then we move away? \n\n        The only action that leaves us at 9 is S (stay). \n\n        So we must take S at turn t1+H-1. \n\n        Therefore, the minimal H must be such that we have arrived at 9 by the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take S at turn t1+H-1 to stay there. \n\n        However, the problem says: we are to reach (0,9). Once we are at 9, we are done? But the problem requires that we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\n        Alternatively, if we arrive at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we are done? and we don't need to take an action? But the sequence requires H actions. \n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        I think I found the issue: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. \n\n        And the state after these actions? The state at the beginning of turn t1+H is y_{t1+H}. \n\n        But the problem says: we require y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\n        This is inconsistent.\n\n        Let me look at the index: \n\n          t=0: a_{t1+0} = a_{t1} -> after this action we get y_{t1+1}\n          t=1: a_{t1+1} -> after this action we get y_{t1+2}\n          ...\n          t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1} -> after this action we get y_{t1+H}\n\n        So we require y_{t1+H-1} to be 9? But y_{t1+H-1} is the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and it is the result of the action at turn t1+H-2. \n\n        Therefore, the condition y_{t1+H-1}=9 means that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n\n        Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? But that action would then change the state to y_{t1+H}. \n\n        And we don't care about y_{t1+H}? \n\n        But the problem says: we are to reach (0,9). \n\n        So if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we have reached 9. Then we don't need to do anything? But the problem requires H actions. \n\n        The minimal H would be the number of actions to get to 9 at the beginning of a turn, and then we take an extra action (S) at that turn? \n\n        But note: we start at turn t1 at y=5. We want to be at 9 at the beginning of some turn. \n\n        The minimal number of moves: we need 4 moves up. Then we would be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+4? \n\n        Then we would have taken 4 actions: at turns t1, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3. \n\n        Then at the beginning of turn t1+4, we are at 9. \n\n        Therefore, we require y_{t1+4}=9. \n\n        But the condition is y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\n        So we have: \n            t1+H-1 = t1+4  => H-1 = 4 => H=5.\n\n        Then we need 5 actions: at turns t1, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3, t1+4? \n\n        But then the state at the beginning of turn t1+4 would be the result of the action at turn t1+3. Then we take an action at turn t1+4? \n\n        But we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+4. Then we take action S at turn t1+4 to remain at 9? \n\n        Then the state at the beginning of turn t1+5 is still 9. \n\n        But the problem requires that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n\n        For H=5: t1+H-1 = 6+5-1 = 10. So we require y_{10}=9. \n\n        How do we get to y_{10}=9? \n\n        We start at turn6: y6=5.\n        We take 5 actions: \n          a6: ... -> y7 = 5 + d6\n          a7: ... -> y8 = y7 + d7\n          a8: ... -> y9 = y8 + d8\n          a9: ... -> y10 = y9 + d9\n\n        We require y10=9.\n\n        But note: the problem also says we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 = 6+5-1=10? \n\n        So y10=9.\n\n        Therefore, we must plan so that after 5 actions we are at y10=9.\n\n        How many moves? We start at 5, we need to go to 9: 4 steps up. Then we have 5 actions: we can do 4 U and 1 S? \n\n        But the S can be anywhere? \n\n        However, we have to avoid collisions.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do 5 U? then we go from 5->6->7->8->9->10 -> but then we are at 10? but the grid is [0,9] -> so we cannot go beyond 9. \n\n        Actually, the update: \n          y_{t+1} = min(max(y_t + Delta, 0), 9)\n\n        So if we are at 9 and do U, we remain at 9? \n\n        But the problem says: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\". \n\n        So if we are at 9 and do U, we stay at 9.\n\n        Similarly, if we are at 0 and do D, we stay at 0.\n\n        Therefore, we can do 5 U: \n          a6=U: y7=min(5+1,9)=6\n          a7=U: y8=7\n          a8=U: y9=8\n          a9=U: y10=9\n          a10? -> but we only take 5 actions: from a6 to a10? \n\n        But H=5: the actions are a6, a7, a8, a9, a10? \n\n        Then we require y_{6+5-1}=y_{10}=9? \n\n        So at the beginning of turn10 we are at 9? \n\n        But note: the state at the beginning of turn10 is the result of the action at turn9. \n\n        Therefore, we need to have y10=9. \n\n        So we can do: \n          a6: U -> y7=6\n          a7: U -> y8=7\n          a8: U -> y9=8\n          a9: U -> y10=9\n\n        Then we have taken 4 U actions. But we have only 4 actions? Then H=4? \n\n        However, the problem requires H actions and the sequence from t=0 to H-1, so for H=4: \n          actions: a6, a7, a8, a9 -> then we get y10=9, but we require y_{t1+H-1}=y_{6+4-1}=y9=8? \n\n        So we are at 8 at the beginning of turn9, and we take an action at turn9 to go to 9 at turn10. But the condition is y_{t1+H-1}=y9=8, not 9.\n\n        Therefore, we must have H=5? \n\n        Then we take 5 actions: a6, a7, a8, a9, a10. \n        We require y_{6+5-1}=y10=9.\n\n        How? \n          a6: U -> y7=6\n          a7: U -> y8=7\n          a8: U -> y9=8\n          a9: U -> y10=9\n          a10: S (or U) -> y11=9 (if we do S) or 9 (if we do U) -> but we don't care about y11? \n\n        But the condition is y10=9? which is satisfied.\n\n        But note: the state at the beginning of turn10 is y10=9. \n\n        How did we get y10? It is the result of a9 (the action taken at turn9). \n\n        And the last action in the sequence is a10? But we require the sequence to be for turns t1 to t1+H-1 = 6 to 6+5-1=10. \n\n        So the actions are at turns: 6,7,8,9,10. \n\n        Then the states: \n          turn6: y6=5 -> take a6:U -> y7=6\n          turn7: y7=6 -> take a7:U -> y8=7\n          turn8: y8=7 -> take a8:U -> y9=8\n          turn9: y9=8 -> take a9:U -> y10=9\n          turn10: y10=9 -> take a10:S (or U) -> y11=9\n\n        But the requirement is that at the beginning of turn10 we are at 9? which is true. \n\n        But the problem says: we require y_{t1+H-1}=y10=9. \n\n        And we have that.\n\n        However, we don't need to take the action at turn10? because we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn10. \n\n        But the sequence requires 5 actions. \n\n        And the problem does not say we stop early. \n\n        Therefore, we must take 5 actions. \n\n        But we only need 4 moves to get to 9. Then the fifth action can be anything that keeps us at 9: S or U (which will be clamped to 9). \n\n        So we can do: U, U, U, U, S (or U) \n\n        But we must avoid collisions at every freeway we are on during the turns.\n\n        Now, let's check the collisions for the sequence: U, U, U, U, S.\n\n        We start at turn6: y6=5 -> freeway5. \n            freeway5 at turn6: car: [-23, -12] -> 0 not in this interval -> safe.\n\n        Action a6=U: then at turn7 we are at y7=6. So at turn7, we are on freeway6.\n            freeway6 at turn7: [25,60] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n        Action a7=U: turn8: y8=7 -> freeway7.\n            freeway7 at turn8: [1+48*(8-6)=1+96=97, 48+96=144] -> safe.\n\n        Action a8=U: turn9: y9=8 -> freeway8.\n            freeway8 at turn9: [1+48*(9-6)=1+144=145, 48+144=192] -> safe.\n\n        Action a9=U: then at turn10 we are at y10=9 -> goal, but note: we are at freeway9? no, freeways are 1..8. So no car at y=9 -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn10: we take a10=S: we are at y11=9 -> safe.\n\n        But wait, the problem says we are only required to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 10? and we are at 9 at the beginning of turn10? and then we take an action at turn10? but that is after we've reached the goal? \n\n        However, the problem requires a sequence of H=5 actions. \n\n        But note: the minimal H? We can do it in 5 actions? but we can also do it in 4? \n\n        However, the condition requires y_{t1+H-1}=9. For H=4: we require y_{6+4-1}=y9=9? \n\n        How would we achieve that? \n          We need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn9.\n\n          Then we start at turn6: y6=5.\n          We need to get to 9 by the beginning of turn9 -> so in 3 actions: \n            a6: ? -> y7\n            a7: ? -> y8\n            a8: ? -> y9=9\n\n          How? \n            a6: U -> y7=6\n            a7: U -> y8=7\n            a8: U -> y9=8 -> not 9.\n\n          So we need an extra U: \n            a6: U -> y7=6\n            a7: U -> y8=7\n            a8: U -> y9=8\n            a9: U -> y10=9\n\n          Then for H=4, we require y_{6+4-1}=y9=8, not 9.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot have H=4. The minimal H is 5? \n\n        But note: we could have taken a double move? No, because we can only move by 1 per action.\n\n        Alternatively, we might use a faster way? \n\n        Actually, we can only move up by at most 1 per turn. So to go from 5 to 9: we need 4 moves up. \n\n        Therefore, we need at least 4 actions. \n\n        But the condition requires that the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is 9. \n\n        We start at turn6: state5. \n\n        After 4 actions (at turns6,7,8,9), we get to state10: which is at the beginning of turn10. \n\n        To have state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1=6+H-1 be 9, we must have 6+H-1 = 10 => H-1=4 => H=5.\n\n        Therefore, minimal H is 5.\n\n        So we must take 5 actions: at turns6,7,8,9,10.\n\n        And we require that at the beginning of turn10 we are at 9. \n\n        So we must have arrived at 9 by the action at turn9. \n\n        Therefore, the action at turn9 must be U and we start at 8 at turn9? \n\n        So the plan: \n          turn6: U -> y7=6\n          turn7: U -> y8=7\n          turn8: U -> y9=8\n          turn9: U -> y10=9\n          turn10: we must take an action, but we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn10? \n                  then we take S (or U) -> y11=9.\n\n        And we require y10=9? which is satisfied.\n\n        Now, we must check collisions for each turn when we are on freeways 1..8.\n\n        We are on:\n          turn6: freeway5 -> check freeway5 at turn6: car5: [-23,-12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n          turn7: freeway6 -> car6 at turn7: [25,60] -> safe.\n          turn8: freeway7 -> car7 at turn8: [1+48*(8-6)=97, 48+96=144] -> safe.\n          turn9: freeway8 -> car8 at turn9: [1+48*3=145, 48+144=192] -> safe.\n          turn10: freeway9 -> no car -> safe.\n\n        But note: at turn10, we are on freeway9? but freeways are only defined for y=1..8? and y=9 is not a freeway? so no car -> safe.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". So if we are on y=9, we don't have to worry.\n\n        Therefore, the sequence: \n          Turn6: U\n          Turn7: U\n          Turn8: U\n          Turn9: U\n          Turn10: S   (or U, but S is also fine)\n\n        But wait: what about the car on freeway1? We never go to freeway1. Similarly, freeways 2,3,4: we don't go to them? \n\n        We are moving: \n          turn6: y5->6 -> so we are on freeway5 at turn6, then freeway6 at turn7, then freeway7 at turn8, then freeway8 at turn9, then freeway9 at turn10.\n\n        We don't step on freeways 1,2,3,4. \n\n        But what if we had to step on freeway4? \n\n        Actually, we are going from 5 to 6 to 7 to 8 to 9. So we skip freeways 1,2,3,4? \n\n        Therefore, we are safe.\n\n        However, let me double-check freeway6 at turn7: \n          freeway6: at turn7: [25,60] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n        But note: freeway6 has a car at turn7? and we are at (0,6) at turn7? and the car is at [25,60] -> which does not cover 0.\n\n        Similarly, freeway7 at turn8: [97,144] -> safe.\n\n        But wait: what about freeway5 at turn6: we are at (0,5) and the car on freeway5 at turn6: [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n        However, there is a potential issue: what if a car appears at a freeway we are on at a later turn? \n\n        But we are computing for each freeway at the turn we are on it.\n\n        So the plan seems safe.\n\n        But note: the car on freeway6 is given at turn6: (24, -11, right, 36). \n          At turn7: \n            tail7 = -11 + 36*(7-6) = -11+36=25\n            head7 = 24 + 36 = 60\n          So the span [25,60] -> safe.\n\n        Similarly, freeway7: (48,1,right,48) at turn6: [1,48] at turn6? \n          At turn8: \n            tail8 = 1 + 48*(8-6)=1+96=97\n            head8 = 48+96=144\n          -> safe.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 5, and the sequence is U, U, U, U, S.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". Is there a way to do it in fewer than 5 actions? \n\n        We need 4 moves up, and then one extra action (to satisfy the condition that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn10). \n\n        But 5 is the minimal H given the condition.\n\n        Alternatively, we might get to 9 earlier? \n\n        How? \n          We start at turn6: y6=5.\n          We want y_{t}=9 for t = 6+H-1.\n\n          For H=5: t=6+5-1=10 -> we want y10=9.\n          For H=4: t=6+4-1=9 -> we want y9=9.\n\n          How to get y9=9? \n            We start at y6=5.\n            We have 3 actions: a6, a7, a8 -> to get y9=9.\n\n            So we need to move 4 steps in 3 actions? Impossible.\n\n          So H=5 is minimal.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n          Turn 6: U\n          Turn 7: U\n          Turn 8: U\n          Turn 9: U\n          Turn 10: S\n\n        But note: the turn indexing: \n          The sequence: \n            t=0: a_{6} -> U\n            t=1: a_{7} -> U\n            t=2: a_{8} -> U\n            t=3: a_{9} -> U\n            t=4: a_{10} -> S\n\n        So we write:\n\n          Turn 6: U\n          Turn 7: U\n          Turn 8: U\n          Turn 9: U\n          Turn 10: S\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" meaning we start at turn6.\n\n        But wait: there is a car on freeway1 at turn6? and freeway2,3,4? We never step on them, so safe.\n\n        But what if we consider freeway5 at turn6? We are on it and it's safe.\n\n        But note: there are multiple cars on freeway2,3,4,5? and they are all the same: \n          freeway2: (-12, -23, right, 6) -> at turn6: [-23,-12] -> safe.\n          freeway3: same -> safe.\n          freeway4: same -> safe.\n\n        And we are on freeway5 at turn6: same -> safe.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n        However, let me check if there is any car that might hit us if we take a different route? But we are going straight up.\n\n        But what about freeway6 at turn6? We are not on it at turn6. But if we were to go to freeway6 at turn6? we can't because we are at 5 at turn6.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is as above.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=5. \n\n        Is there a way to do it in H=5 with a different sequence? But we have to do 4 U and then one S (or U). \n\n        We can also do U, U, U, U, U -> then we are at 9 at turn10, and then at turn11 we are still at 9? but that is the same.\n\n        But the condition is satisfied.\n\n        However, the problem says: minimal number of turns. H=5 is minimal.\n\n        But wait: what if we can do it in 5 turns but without going through freeways 6,7,8? \n\n        We are at 5 and we need to go to 9: we must go through 6,7,8. \n\n        So we have to go through them.\n\n        Therefore, the above sequence is valid.\n\n        However, let me check freeway6 at turn7: [25,60] -> safe.\n\n        But what about freeway6 at an earlier turn? \n\n        We are at freeway6 only at turn7. \n\n        Now, let me see if there is any car that might be at freeway6 at turn7? We have one car: the one we computed.\n\n        But note: the problem says: for freeway6, there is one car: (24, -11, right, 36). \n\n        So only one car per freeway? \n\n        Yes, the table lists one car per freeway.\n\n        Therefore, we are safe.\n\n        But wait: the car on freeway6 is very long? but at turn7 it is at [25,60] -> so 0 is not in that interval.\n\n        So the answer is:\n\n          Turn 6: U\n          Turn 7: U\n          Turn 8: U\n          Turn 9: U\n          Turn 10: S\n\n        However, note that at turn10 we are at freeway9 and we take S -> we remain at 9. \n\n        But the problem only requires that we reach 9 at turn10 (the beginning). Then we take an action at turn10? but that is after we've reached. \n\n        But the problem requires 5 actions. \n\n        Alternatively, we might be able to do nothing at turn10? but we have to take an action. \n\n        But note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions\", and we must output 5 actions.\n\n        Therefore, we output the above.\n\n        But what if we do U at turn10? then we are still at 9. So that is also safe. \n\n        We can do:\n\n          Turn 6: U\n          Turn 7: U\n          Turn 8: U\n          Turn 9: U\n          Turn 10: U\n\n        But that is also acceptable.\n\n        However, S is also acceptable. \n\n        I'll choose S for clarity.\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns\", and both have H=5. \n\n        So both are minimal.\n\n        We'll choose one.\n\n        But note: is there any reason to avoid U? if we are at 9, then U is equivalent to S. \n\n        So it doesn't matter.\n\n        Therefore, the answer:\n\n          Turn 6: U\n          Turn 7: U\n          Turn 8: U\n          Turn 9: U\n          Turn 10: S\n\n        However, let me re-check the car on freeway5 at turn6: it's safe, freeway6 at turn7: safe, freeway7 at turn8: safe, freeway8 at turn9: safe.\n\n        But what about the car on freeway1? It moves: \n          At turn6: [ -11, 0] -> so if we were on freeway1 at turn6, we would be at (0,1) and collide? but we are at (0,5) at turn6 -> safe.\n\n        Similarly, freeway2 at turn6: [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n        But what if we wait? \n\n        We are not waiting, so we are moving up.\n\n        Therefore, the sequence is safe.\n\n        However, there is a car on freeway6 at turn6: \n          freeway6: [ -11, 24] at turn6? \n          But we are at freeway5 at turn6, not freeway6.\n\n        And at turn7: we are at freeway6 and the car is at [25,60] -> safe.\n\n        But note: what if the car on freeway6 at turn6 is at [-11,24]? and at turn6, 0 is in [-11,24]? \n          Then if we were on freeway6 at turn6, we would collide. \n\n        However, we are not on freeway6 at turn6. \n\n        So safe.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal sequence is as above.\n\n        But wait: what if we try to go faster? We cannot.\n\n        Or what if we go down? That would be more turns.\n\n        So we are confident.\n\n        However, let me check if we can do it in 5 turns but with a different path? \n\n        For example, if we go up to 6, then wait at 6? then up to 7,8,9? \n\n        That would be: \n          a6: U -> y7=6\n          a7: S -> y8=6\n          a8: U -> y9=7\n          a9: U -> y10=8\n          a10: U -> y11=9\n\n        Then we are at 9 at the beginning of turn11? but we require to be at 9 at the beginning of turn10 (which is y10=8) -> not satisfied.\n\n        So we must be at 9 at turn10? \n\n        Therefore, we must have y10=9.\n\n        The only way is to have 4 ups in the first 4 actions.\n\n        Therefore, the above sequence is the only minimal one.\n\n        But we can do the 4 ups in any order? but we are going straight up.\n\n        However, we could go up, then down, then up? but that would take more moves.\n\n        So the minimal is the straight up.\n\n        Therefore, the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: S\n}\n\n        But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=5. \n\n        However, is there a sequence that uses H=5 but avoids a potential collision that I missed? \n\n        Let me check the car on freeway5 at turn6: safe.\n\n        But what about freeway5 at turn7? \n          We are not on freeway5 at turn7. We are on freeway6.\n\n        But what if the car on freeway5 at turn7? \n          freeway5: at turn7: \n            tail7 = -23 + 6*(7-6) = -17\n            head7 = -12 + 6 = -6\n          -> [-17,-6] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n        Similarly, freeway5 at turn8: [-23+12=-11, -12+12=0] -> so at turn8, the car on freeway5 is [-11,0] -> so 0 is included? \n          But we are not on freeway5 at turn8. We are on freeway7.\n\n        However, if we were to be on freeway5 at turn8, we would collide. \n\n        But we are not.\n\n        Similarly, freeway2,3,4 at turn8: \n          freeway2 at turn8: \n            tail8 = -23 + 6*(8-6)= -23+12=-11\n            head8 = -12+12=0\n          -> [-11,0] -> so if we were on freeway2 at turn8, we collide.\n\n        But we are at freeway7 at turn8 -> safe.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, the sequence is valid.\n\n        I think that's it.\n\n        But wait: the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, \\dots, 8\". \n\n        And we are only colliding if we are on the freeway at the same turn as the car and the car covers x=0. \n\n        We have checked the freeway we are on at each turn.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Final answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: S\n}\n</think>\nTo reach the goal position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined to be optimal.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 5\\) at turn 6 and needs to reach \\(y = 9\\). The minimal vertical distance to cover is 4 units, requiring at least 4 \"U\" (up) actions.\n- The condition requires the player to be at \\(y = 9\\) at the beginning of turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 6 + H - 1\\). After evaluating:\n  - For \\(H = 4\\), the player would be at \\(y = 8\\) at the beginning of turn \\(9\\) (since \\(6 + 4 - 1 = 9\\)), which is not the goal.\n  - For \\(H = 5\\), the player can reach \\(y = 9\\) at the beginning of turn \\(10\\) (since \\(6 + 5 - 1 = 10\\)) with 4 \"U\" actions and one additional action (to satisfy the sequence length). Thus, \\(H = 5\\) is minimal.\n- The sequence uses 4 \"U\" actions to move from \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 9\\) and one \"S\" (stay) action at the end to remain at \\(y = 9\\).\n\n### Collision Avoidance:\n- **Turn 6 (\\(y = 5\\))**: The car on freeway 5 at turn 6 has span \\([-23, -12]\\). Position \\(x = 0\\) is not in this span → safe.\n- **Turn 7 (\\(y = 6\\))**: The car on freeway 6 at turn 7 has span \\([25, 60]\\) (computed as tail \\(-11 + 36 \\times (7-6) = 25\\), head \\(24 + 36 = 60\\)). Position \\(x = 0\\) is not in \\([25, 60]\\) → safe.\n- **Turn 8 (\\(y = 7\\))**: The car on freeway 7 at turn 8 has span \\([97, 144]\\) (computed as tail \\(1 + 48 \\times (8-6) = 97\\), head \\(48 + 96 = 144\\)). Position \\(x = 0\\) is not in \\([97, 144]\\) → safe.\n- **Turn 9 (\\(y = 8\\))**: The car on freeway 8 at turn 9 has span \\([145, 192]\\) (computed as tail \\(1 + 48 \\times (9-6) = 145\\), head \\(48 + 144 = 192\\)). Position \\(x = 0\\) is not in \\([145, 192]\\) → safe.\n- **Turn 10 (\\(y = 9\\))**: No cars on freeway 9 (freeways only exist for \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)) → safe.\n\nThe sequence of actions is therefore:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: S\n}",

The current turn is t1=7, and I start at y=6.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. Each car has a head, tail, direction, and speed. For right-moving cars, the span moves right by s per turn. For left-moving, it moves left by s per turn.\n\nLooking at the car states:\n\n- Freeway 1: (12, 1, right, 12) — so head at 12, tail at 1, moving right at speed 12.\n\nSince it's right-moving, the span is [tail, head]? No, the notation says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and it moves to [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it's [h, τ] moving to [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)].\n\nBut in this case, all cars are right-moving, I think. Let me check:\n\nFreeway 1: d=right, s=12\n\nFreeway 2: d=right, s=6\n\nFreeway 3: d=right, s=6\n\nFreeway 4: d=right, s=6\n\nFreeway 5: d=right, s=6\n\nFreeway 6: d=right, s=36\n\nFreeway 7: d=right, s=48\n\nFreeway 8: d=right, s=48\n\nAll are right-moving. So for each, span at time T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] for T >= t1.\n\nt1=7.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y at turn T, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at time T.\n\nThe player is at position (0, y_t), so x=0 always, only y changes.\n\nAt each turn, after moving, we check if for the current y, there is a car on that row (freeway) such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nImportant point: if you move to a different y, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So when you take an action at turn T, you move to y_{T+1}, but during turn T, you are still on y_T for collision purposes.\n\nThe collision definition says: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd the note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on y_T. You choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}. Then at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn based on current y_t and car spans at time t.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=6 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nPossible actions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same).\n\ny must be between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nCurrently at y=6, target y=9, so I need to increase y by 3. Each U action increases y by 1, so minimum 3 turns if I can go straight up without collision.\n\nBut I have to avoid cars on y=7 and y=8, since I'm starting at y=6, and going to y=9, I will pass through y=7 and y=8.\n\ny=6 is freeway, but I'm at (0,6) at turn t1=7, and I need to check if there is a collision at turn 7 for y=6.\n\nThe collision is for the freeway I'm on at that turn.\n\nAt turn t1=7, I am on freeway y=6. Is there a car on freeway 6 that has 0 in its span at turn 7?\n\nFreeway 6: car (60, 25, right, 36)\n\nSince it's right-moving, span at time T is [τ + s(T-7), h + s(T-7)] = [25 + 36(T-7), 60 + 36(T-7)]\n\nAt T=7, span = [25 + 0, 60 + 0] = [25, 60]\n\n0 is not in [25,60], so no collision at turn 7 on y=6.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but since I'm only on y=6 at turn 7, I only care about that.\n\nNow, I need to move to y=9.\n\nEach move: if I go up, y increases by 1 each turn.\n\nBut I have to be careful when I am on y=7 and y=8, not to be there when a car has 0 in its span.\n\nAlso, since I might stay or move down, but since I need to go up, moving down might not help, but sometimes it could avoid a collision, but in this case, since cars are moving, and I need to go up, probably best to go up directly if possible.\n\nFirst, let's find out for each freeway and each turn, whether there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nThat is, for freeway k, at time T, is 0 in the span of the car on that freeway.\n\nEach freeway has only one car? From the table, it seems each freeway has one car listed.\n\nFreeway 1 to 8 each have one car.\n\nSo for each freeway k, and time T, we can compute the span and see if 0 is inside.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, span at T: [τ + s(T-7), h + s(T-7)]\n\nAnd 0 is in the span if τ + s(T-7) <= 0 <= h + s(T-7)\n\nFor right-moving, span is [τ, h] at t1, moving to [τ + s(T-7), h + s(T-7)]\n\nSo min and max: since τ and h, with τ <= h I assume? In the notation, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" so τ is tail, h is head, so τ <= h, and span is [τ, h].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all right.\n\nIn freeway 1: (12,1,right,12), so τ=1, h=12, s=12.\n\nAt T, span: [1 + 12(T-7), 12 + 12(T-7)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-6,-17,right,6), τ=-17, h=-6, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [-17 + 6(T-7), -6 + 6(T-7)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nFreeway 4: same\n\nFreeway 5: same\n\nAll freeways 2,3,4,5 have the same car? τ=-17, h=-6, s=6\n\nBut different freeways, so each has its own car, but same parameters.\n\nFreeway 6: (60,25,right,36) so τ=25, h=60, s=36\n\nSpan at T: [25 + 36(T-7), 60 + 36(T-7)]\n\nFreeway 7: (96,49,right,48) τ=49, h=96, s=48\n\nSpan: [49 + 48(T-7), 96 + 48(T-7)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7? (96,49,right,48)\n\nNow, for a given freeway k and time T, collision if 0 is in the span.\n\nThat is, for freeway k at T, if τ_k + s_k (T-7) <= 0 <= h_k + s_k (T-7)\n\nNow, since I start from turn 7, and I need to reach y=9 at some turn, say T=7+H, but H is the number of turns, so after H actions, at turn t1+H, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nt1=7, position at turn 7: y=6.\n\nAfter action a_7, at turn 8, y=y7 + Δy, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 7+H, y_{7+H} = 9.\n\nAnd we want min H, and the sequence.\n\nSince y must be integer 0-9, and I start at 6, end at 9, min H is at least 3, if I go up each time.\n\nBut I might need to wait if there is a collision.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each possible T, whether there is a collision, meaning 0 is in the car span at that turn.\n\nDefine T relative to t1=7.\n\nSet Δt = T - 7, so at turn 7, Δt=0.\n\nFor freeway 1: τ=1, h=12, s=12\n\nSpan at Δt: [1 + 12Δt, 12 + 12Δt]\n\n0 in span if 1 + 12Δt <= 0 <= 12 + 12Δt\n\nBut 1 + 12Δt <=0 implies 12Δt <= -1, Δt <= -1/12, but Δt >=0, so impossible. Left inequality never true for Δt>=0.\n\nRight inequality 0 <= 12 + 12Δt always true for Δt>=0.\n\nBut for 0 to be in [L,R], need L <=0 and 0<=R.\n\nHere L = 1 + 12Δt >=1 >0 for Δt>=0, so L >0, thus 0 < L <= something, so 0 not in [L,R] since L>0.\n\nSimilarly, for all Δt, L =1 +12Δt >=1 >0, so 0 not in span. So on freeway 1, never collision for T>=7.\n\nIs that right? At Δt=0, [1,12], 0 not in. At Δt=1, [13,24], etc., all positive, so yes, freeway 1 is always safe.\n\nNow freeway 2: τ=-17, h=-6, s=6\n\nSpan: [-17 +6Δt, -6 +6Δt]\n\n0 in span if -17 +6Δt <= 0 <= -6 +6Δt\n\nLeft: -17 +6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=17 => Δt <= 17/6 ≈ 2.833, so Δt <=2 since integer? Δt integer, T integer.\n\nΔt = T-7, integer >=0.\n\nSo -17 +6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=17 => Δt <= 17/6 ≈2.833, so for Δt=0,1,2\n\nRight: 0 <= -6 +6Δt => 6 <=6Δt => Δt >=1\n\nSo both: left true for Δt<=2, right true for Δt>=1, so for Δt=1 and Δt=2.\n\nFor Δt=1: left: -17+6= -11 <=0, true; right: 0 <= -6+6=0, 0<=0 true, so yes.\n\nFor Δt=2: -17+12= -5 <=0, true; 0 <= -6+12=6, true.\n\nFor Δt=0: left: -17<=0 true, but right: 0 <= -6? 0 <= -6 false, so not.\n\nΔt=3: left: -17+18=1 <=0? 1<=0 false; right: 0 <= -6+18=12 true, but left false, so not.\n\nSo collision on freeway 2 at Δt=1 and Δt=2, i.e., T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as 2, so also collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway 4: same, collision at T=8,9.\n\nFreeway 5: same, collision at T=8,9.\n\nNow freeway 6: τ=25, h=60, s=36\n\nSpan: [25 +36Δt, 60 +36Δt]\n\n0 in span? 25+36Δt <=0? 36Δt <=-25, impossible for Δt>=0.\n\n0 <=60+36Δt always true.\n\nBut L=25+36Δt >=25>0, so 0 not in span. Always safe.\n\nFreeway 7: τ=49, h=96, s=48\n\nSpan: [49+48Δt, 96+48Δt] all positive, 0 not in, safe.\n\nFreeway 8: same, safe.\n\nSo only freeways 2,3,4,5 have possible collisions, and only at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSpecifically, at T=8 (turn 8, Δt=1) and T=9 (turn 9, Δt=2), for y=2,3,4,5? Freeways 2,3,4,5 correspond to y=2,3,4,5? Freeway k is y=k, I assume.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to y=8, so freeway 1 is y=1, freeway 2 is y=2, ..., up to freeway 8 is y=8.\n\nSo:\n\n- y=1: always safe\n\n- y=2: collision at T=8 and T=9\n\n- y=3: collision at T=8 and T=9 (since same car params)\n\n- y=4: collision at T=8 and T=9\n\n- y=5: collision at T=8 and T=9\n\n- y=6: always safe (as we saw)\n\n- y=7: always safe\n\n- y=8: always safe\n\nNow, I am at turn 7, y=6, which is safe.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, it's above, so no cars there, so when I reach y=9, no collision possible.\n\nBut I need to be on y=9 at some turn, and since no cars, it's fine.\n\nNow, the path: I start at turn 7, y=6.\n\nI take actions from turn 7 onwards.\n\nAt each turn, after action, I move to new y at next turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn and y.\n\nTurn 7: y=6 (safe)\n\nNow, I choose action a_7, which determines y for turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, a_8 determines y for turn 9, and so on.\n\nI need y to be 9 at some turn T.\n\nSince min turns, I should go up as fast as possible.\n\nOption 1: Go straight up.\n\nAction sequence: U, U, U\n\nThen:\n\n- At turn 7: y=6, safe (as we know)\n\n- Action a_7 = U, so y for turn 8: y=7\n\n- At turn 8: I am on y=7. Is there collision? y=7 is freeway 7, which we said always safe, so no collision.\n\n- Then action a_8 = U, so y for turn 9: y=8\n\n- At turn 9: on y=8, which is safe, no collision.\n\n- Then action a_9 = U, so y for turn 10: y=9\n\n- At turn 10: y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars, safe. And we reached y=9 at turn 10.\n\nBut turn 10 is after 3 actions: actions at turn 7,8,9.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think H actions, from t= t1 to t1+H-1, so after H actions, at turn t1+H.\n\nIn this case, after 3 actions: actions at t=7,8,9, position at turn 10 is y=9.\n\nt1+H =7+H, and y=9.\n\nH=3, turn 10.\n\nBut is this collision-free?\n\nAt turn 8: y=7, freeway 7, span at T=8: for y=7, freeway 7: τ=49, h=96, s=48, Δt=1, span [49+48(1), 96+48(1)] = [97,144], not including 0, safe.\n\nAt turn 9: y=8, freeway 8: same as 7, [49+48(2),96+48(2)]=[49+96,96+192]= wait no, Δt=2 from t1=7.\n\nT=9, Δt=9-7=2.\n\nSpan: [49+48*2, 96+48*2] = [49+96, 96+192]= [145, 288], not 0.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are safe, as we said.\n\nIn the sequence, I go to y=7 at turn 8, y=8 at turn 9, y=9 at turn 10.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9, which is at turn 10.\n\nBut is there any issue with the cars on y=2,3,4,5? But I am not on those rows, so no problem.\n\nSo with H=3, I can reach: actions U at t=7, U at t=8, U at t=9.\n\nAt turn 10, y=9.\n\nBut the player position is given at turn t1=7, and we take actions starting from t1.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, H=3, actions at t=7,8,9.\n\nPosition after: at turn 8,9,10.\n\nAt turn 10, y=9.\n\nBut let me confirm the collision at each point.\n\nTurn 7: y=6, safe.\n\nTurn 8: after a_7=U, y=7, on freeway 7, car span at T=8: as above, [97,144], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 9: after a_8=U, y=8, on freeway 8, span at T=9: [49+48*2, 96+48*2]= [49+96,96+192]= [145,288], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 10: y=9, not a freeway, no car, safe.\n\nAnd I reached at turn 10.\n\nBut H=3 turns of actions.\n\nThe problem says \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", and \"reach (0,9)\".\n\nBut is y=9 considered reached when we are at that position? Yes.\n\nBut in this case, it seems fine.\n\nBut why are there cars on y=2,3,4,5? But I didn't go there, so no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can do it faster? Minimum is 3 since I need to go up 3 steps.\n\nCould I go up in fewer? No, because each U only increases by 1, and I start at 6, need 9, so at least 3 actions.\n\nUnless I can jump, but no, actions are U,D,S, so only change by 1 or 0.\n\nSo min H=3 is possible.\n\nBut is there a collision at some point I missed?\n\nIn the sequence above, I never go to y=2,3,4,5, so the collisions there don't affect me.\n\nAt turn 8 and 9, when I am on y=7 and y=8, which are safe.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 7 and 8 at those turns.\n\nFreeway 7: at T=8, Δt=1, span [49 + 48*1, 96 + 48*1] = [97, 144], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=9, Δt=2, [49+96,96+192]= [145,288], not 0.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 same.\n\ny=6 at T=7: [25,60], not 0.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut the car on y=6: at T=7, span [25,60], not 0.\n\nIf I were to stay on y=6, at T=8: span [25+36,60+36]= [61,96], not 0, etc., safe.\n\nBut I don't need to stay.\n\nSo with three U actions, I can reach in H=3.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach earlier.\n\nFor example, if I were already at y=9 at turn 8, but I start at y=6 at turn 7.\n\nAfter one action, at turn 8, y could be 5,6,7.\n\nIf I go U at t=7, y=7 at turn 8.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 8, I need to have y=9 at turn 8, which means at turn 7, before action, y=6, after action U, y=7 at turn 8, so at turn 8 y=7, not 9.\n\nTo have y=9 at turn 8, I must have been at y=8 at turn 7 and go U, but at turn 7 I am at y=6, so impossible to be at y=9 before turn 10 with min actions.\n\nAt turn 9, possible y: if I go U,U, at turn 9 y=8.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 9, I need at turn 8 y=8 and go U at turn 8, but at turn 8, if I am at y=8, then at turn 9 y=9.\n\nBut at turn 8, how can I be at y=8? From turn 7 y=6, I need to go to y=7 at turn 8, then to y=8 at turn 9.\n\nSo earliest at turn 10 for y=9.\n\nSimilarly, if I go faster, but I can't.\n\nSo H=3 is minimum.\n\nBut in the sequence I have, it works.\n\nBut why is the car information given, if I don't need it? Perhaps for other paths.\n\nMaybe I can go directly but there is a collision if I go to y=8 or something, but in this case no.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 8 and 9, there are collisions on y=2,3,4,5, but I am not there.\n\nPerhaps if I had to go through, but I don't.\n\nMaybe I can reach y=9 faster by not going straight, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nFor example, if I go down and then up, but that would take more turns, worse.\n\nOr stay and then go up, but also more turns.\n\nSo H=3 should be achievable.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions again.\n\nPerhaps for y=7 or y=8, I miscomputed.\n\nFreeway 7: car at t1: head 96, tail 49, right, speed 48.\n\nAt T=8, Δt=1, tail position: τ + s Δt = 49 + 48*1 = 97\n\nHead: 96 + 48*1 = 144\n\nSpan [97,144], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly at T=9, Δt=2, [49+96, 96+192]= [145,288], no.\n\ny=6 at T=7: τ=25, h=60, [25,60]\n\nAt T=8: [25+36,60+36]= [61,96], etc.\n\nAll fine.\n\nBut the cars on y=2,3,4,5 at T=8 and T=9 have 0 in span.\n\nFor example, y=2 at T=8: freeway 2, τ=-17, h=-6, s=6, Δt=1, span [-17+6, -6+6] = [-11, 0]\n\n0 <=0 is true, and -11 <=0 true, so 0 in [-11,0], yes collision if on y=2 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly at T=9: [-17+12, -6+12]= [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nBut I am not on y=2.\n\nSo for my path, no problem.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=3 with actions: U at t=7, U at t=8, U at t=9.\n\nBut the sequence should be from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1.\n\nH=3, t1=7, so actions at t=7,8,9.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t_1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nBut at turn 9, action U, which sets y for turn 10 to 9.\n\nPosition at turn 10 is (0,9).\n\nThe problem says \"reach (0,9)\", which is at turn 10.\n\nBut the turn when we reach is t1+H.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can stop earlier, but no.\n\nAnother thing: y=9 is not a freeway, so when I am at y=9, no collision possible, and it's the target.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut why are there multiple cars with same parameters? For example, y=2,3,4,5 all have the same car span, so all have collision at T=8 and 9.\n\nBut since I avoid those rows, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I could go through y=1, but y=1 is safe, but it's lower, I need to go up, so not necessary.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=7, then to y=8, etc., same as before.\n\nSo I think H=3 is possible.\n\nBut let me see if at turn 8, if I go to y=8 directly? No, from y=6, I can only go to 5,6,7 at turn 8.\n\nNot directly to 8.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be three U actions.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to write it.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH=3.\n\nSequence: a_{7}=U, a_{8}=U, a_{9}=U\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut let me make sure about the collision note.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nIn my case, at each turn, when I move, I change y only at the next turn.\n\nFor example, at turn 7, I am on y=6, I choose a_7=U, so I will be on y=7 at turn 8, but at turn 7, I am still on y=6.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSuppose at some point I was on a row with car, but in this path, no.\n\nAnother path: suppose I go up to y=7 at turn 8, then I could stay or something, but no need.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 earlier by being at y=8 at turn 8, but impossible from y=6 at turn 7.\n\nUnless I start higher, but I start at 6.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps for y=5 or something, but I don't go there.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose I try to go through y=5 at some point.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=5 at turn 8, but at turn 8, y=5 has collision, since T=8, freeway 5 collision.\n\nIf I go to y=5 at turn 8, I would collide.\n\nBut in my path, I don't.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=4, etc., all have collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut I avoid.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 3.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 7: U \\\\ Turn 8: U \\\\ Turn 9: U }\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t1}\" etc., and \"Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t1 +1}\" so for t1=7.\n\nAlso, in the sequence, up to t1+H-1.\n\nH=3, so t=7,8,9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should write it clearly.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Collisions\n- The car on each freeway moves right with constant speed. The span (position) of a car on freeway \\(k\\) at turn \\(T\\) is given by \\([\\tau_k + s_k (T - 7), h_k + s_k (T - 7)]\\), where \\(\\tau_k\\) is the tail, \\(h_k\\) is the head, and \\(s_k\\) is the speed at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\).\n- Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) if the player is on freeway \\(y_T\\) and \\(0\\) is within the car's span at that turn.\n- From the car states:\n  - Freeway 1 (\\(y=1\\)): Always safe (span never contains 0 for \\(T \\geq 7\\)).\n  - Freeway 2 (\\(y=2\\)): Collision at \\(T=8\\) and \\(T=9\\) (span contains 0).\n  - Freeway 3 (\\(y=3\\)): Collision at \\(T=8\\) and \\(T=9\\) (same parameters as freeway 2).\n  - Freeway 4 (\\(y=4\\)): Collision at \\(T=8\\) and \\(T=9\\) (same parameters as freeway 2).\n  - Freeway 5 (\\(y=5\\)): Collision at \\(T=8\\) and \\(T=9\\) (same parameters as freeway 2).\n  - Freeway 6 (\\(y=6\\)): Always safe (span never contains 0).\n  - Freeway 7 (\\(y=7\\)): Always safe (span never contains 0).\n  - Freeway 8 (\\(y=8\\)): Always safe (span never contains 0).\n- Position \\(y=9\\) has no freeway, so no collision is possible there.\n\n### Path to Reach \\(y=9\\) Minimally\n- Starting at turn 7, \\(y_7 = 6\\) (safe).\n- The target is \\(y=9\\), which requires a net increase of 3 in the y-coordinate. Since each \"U\" action increases y by 1, the minimum \\(H\\) is 3.\n- Sequence of actions:\n  - At turn 7: Action \\(a_7 = U\\) → \\(y_8 = 7\\).\n    - Turn 8: Position \\(y_8 = 7\\) (freeway 7, always safe).\n  - At turn 8: Action \\(a_8 = U\\) → \\(y_9 = 8\\).\n    - Turn 9: Position \\(y_9 = 8\\) (freeway 8, always safe).\n  - At turn 9: Action \\(a_9 = U\\) → \\(y_{10} = 9\\).\n    - Turn 10: Position \\(y_{10} = 9\\) (no freeway, target reached safely).\n- This sequence avoids all freeways with collisions (y=2,3,4,5) at critical turns (T=8 and T=9) and uses only safe freeways (y=6,7,8) during transit.\n\n### Minimal Turns \\(H\\)\n- \\(H = 3\\) (actions at turns 7, 8, and 9).\n- The position (0,9) is reached at turn 10.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- Turn 7: U\n- Turn 8: U\n- Turn 9: U\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U\n}",

Collision happens only if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T, and for the car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each turn, starting from t1=8.\n\nThe player position is updated after the action, so at turn t, I choose an action, then move to y_{t+1} based on that action. But for collision, it's checked at turn T, meaning when I'm at position y_T, I check the car on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nThe note says: if I move to y_{T+1} at turn T, I'm not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, only at T+1. So at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I check collision with car on y_T at turn T. Then after moving, at turn T+1, I'm on y_{T+1}, and check car on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nAlso, the grid is vertical, y from 0 to 9, and I start at (0,7) at turn 8, I think? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t1=8, I'm at (0,7). Then I choose action a_8, which determines y_9. Then at turn 9, I'm at y_9, and so on.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn when I'm on a freeway.\n\ny=0 and y=9 might be safe, no cars, since cars are on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe problem says: avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8. So y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars to collide with.\n\nAlso, reaching (0,9) means I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nNow, the goal is to reach y=9 with minimal H, meaning from turn t1=8 to turn t1+H-1, I think? Let's see the sequence.\n\nIt says: sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nt starts from 0, so t=0: a_{t1 + 0} = a_{t1}, t=1: a_{t1+1}, ..., up to t=H-1: a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut it says y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9? Let's read carefully.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\"\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nNow, the position after action: when we apply action at turn t, it affects y_{t+1}.\n\nStandard: at turn t, we are at position y_t, we choose action a_t, then we move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, before action, we are at y_t.\n\nAfter action, at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nIn terms of the state:\n\n- At start of turn t: position y_t\n\n- Choose a_t\n\n- Then position becomes y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy(a_t)\n\n- Now, collision check: at turn t, since we are at y_t during turn t, I think we check collision at (t, y_t) with the car on freeway y_t at time t.\n\nThe note confirms: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo at turn T, you are on y_T, and you check against the car on y_T at time T.\n\nIf you move to y_{T+1}, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, check car on y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nIn this case, since we start at turn t1=8, position (0,7).\n\nSo at turn 8, we are at y=7, so we must check collision with car on freeway 7 at time t=8.\n\nThen we choose action a_8, which determines y_9.\n\nAt turn 9, we are at y_9, check car on y_9 at time 9, and so on.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nt1=8, so y_{8 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nLet T = t1 + H - 1, so y_T = 9.\n\nSince t1=8, T = 8 + H - 1.\n\ny_T = 9.\n\nT is the turn when we are at y=9.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T=9, and since y=9 has no car, no collision issue.\n\nBut we need to reach there.\n\nNow, the actions are from t= t1 to t= t1 + H -1, which are turns 8 to 8+H-1.\n\nNumber of actions: H actions, from a_8 to a_{8+H-1}.\n\nAfter these H actions, we are at position y_{8+H}.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{8 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{8+H-1} =9 means at turn 8+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nSo after H-1 actions? Let's index.\n\nAt turn 8: position y_8 =7\n\nApply a_8, go to y_9\n\nApply a_9, go to y_10\n\n...\n\nApply a_{8+k-1}, go to y_{8+k}\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 8+k, position y_{8+k}\n\nWe want y_{8 + H -1} =9 for some H.\n\nSet T = 8 + H -1, so y_T =9.\n\nT must be at least 8, since at turn 8 we are at y=7.\n\nThe smallest T is when we can reach y=9 fastest.\n\ny starts at 7, to go to 9, we need to increase y by 2, so minimum 2 moves up, but we might need to wait or something to avoid cars.\n\nBut y=9 is safe, so once we reach y=9, we are done, I think, since no collision at y=9.\n\nThe sequence stops when we reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nNow, we need to find minimal H such that after H actions, but y_{8+H-1}=9, which means at turn 8+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nFor example, if we do nothing, at turn 8, y=7.\n\nIf we do U at turn 8, y9=8\n\nThen U at turn 9, y10=9, so at turn 10, y=9.\n\nT=10, which is 8 + H -1, so 10 = 8 + H -1 => H-1=2, H=3? Let's see.\n\nt1=8, H actions: a_8, a_9, ..., a_{8+H-1}\n\nAfter a_8, y9\n\nAfter a_9, y10\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{8+H-1}, y_{8+H}\n\nBut we need y_{8+H-1} =9.\n\ny_{8+H-1} is the position at turn 8+H-1, before action a_{8+H-1} is taken.\n\nAt turn 8+H-1, we are at y_{8+H-1}, then we choose a_{8+H-1}, then go to y_{8+H}.\n\nBut we need y_{8+H-1} =9, meaning at that turn, we are already at 9, so no need to move further, but we might still need to choose an action, but since we are at 9, we can choose S or something, but the position is already 9.\n\nThe condition is y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so for H, it includes the action that might be taken at that turn, but since we are at 9, we can choose S to stay, or U/D but y is clipped to [0,9], so U at y=9 stays or error? The update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with y in [0,9], so if at y=9 and U, probably stays 9, similarly D at y=0 stays 0.\n\nBut for reaching, if we are at y=9 at turn T, we can choose S to stay, but it's fine.\n\nIn the sequence, for the turn when we are at y=9, we might need to specify the action, but since we are already at 9, any action keeps us at 9 or moves away, but we want to be at 9, so probably S is chosen, but U or D at boundary might be issue, but let's assume the bounds are enforced, so at y=9, U keeps y=9, similarly for D.\n\nBut to be safe, we can choose S when at target.\n\nBut for minimal H, we want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nBack to the car positions.\n\nFirst, list all cars at time t=8.\n\nThe car state is given at turn t1=8.\n\nFor each freeway k, we have (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nDirection: right or left, but in the update, left-moving and right-moving are defined with span.\n\nFor left-moving: span at T is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (24,13, right, 12)\n\nHead 24, tail 13, but for right-moving, the span should be [τ, h] since it's moving right, so at t1, span [13,24]? But it says (head h, tail τ), so for right-moving, head is the front, tail is the back, so as it moves right, head increases.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head decreases.\n\nIn the update:\n\nFor left-moving: span at t1: [h, τ]? No.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nSpan(t1) = [h, τ], so for left-moving, at t1, positions from h to τ, with h > τ I assume, since moving left, head decreases.\n\nIn the example, for freeway 1: (24,13, right,12)\n\nDirection right, so at t1=8, span is given as (head h=24, tail τ=13), but for right-moving, the span at t1 should be [τ, h] = [13,24], I think.\n\nThe text says: for right-moving, \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\"\n\nLet's see: \"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nSimilarly for left: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\"\n\nIn the car state table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor freeway 1: (24,13,right,12), so head=24, tail=13, direction=right.\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [13,24]\n\nAt time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [13 + 12(T-8), 24 + 12(T-8)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be span at t1 [h, τ], then [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nBut in this problem, all cars given are right-moving, except I need to check.\n\nList:\n\nFreeway k | cars\n\n1 | (24,13,right,12)\n\n2 | (0,-11,right,6)\n\n3 | (0,-11,right,6)\n\n4 | (0,-11,right,6)\n\n5 | (0,-11,right,6)\n\n6 | (-48,-83,right,36)\n\n7 | (-48,-95,right,48)\n\n8 | (-48,-95,right,48)\n\nAll are right-moving, so for all, span at time T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd collision when player is on freeway k at time T, and 0 is in the span of the car on that freeway at time T.\n\nNow, player starts at turn 8, y=7, so on freeway 7.\n\nAt turn 8, we must not have collision on y=7.\n\nSo for freeway 7 at t=8, car: (-48,-95,right,48)\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-8), h + s(T-8)] = [-95 + 48(T-8), -48 + 48(T-8)]\n\nAt T=8: [-95 + 0, -48 + 0] = [-95, -48]\n\nIs 0 in this interval? -95 to -48, all negative, 0 not in, so no collision at t=8 on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but we only care when we are on them.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 has no car, so once there, safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9 from y=7, we need to go through y=8 or directly? Actions: U, D, S.\n\nFrom y=7, if we go U, to y=8.\n\nThen from y=8, U to y=9.\n\nOr we could go D, but that would take longer, so probably not minimal.\n\nBut we might need to wait at some y to avoid cars.\n\ny=8 has a car, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 car: (-48,-95,right,48)\n\nSimilar to freeway 7.\n\nNow, let's find when the cars on y=7 and y=8 have 0 in their span, because that's when collision would occur if we are on that freeway at that time.\n\nSince the cars are moving right, the span is shifting right over time.\n\nFor a given freeway k, the time when 0 is in the span.\n\nFor freeway k, span at T: [τ + s(T-8), h + s(T-8)] for right-moving.\n\nSet the interval to contain 0.\n\nSo min(span) <= 0 <= max(span)\n\nSince it's [low, high], so low <= 0 <= high.\n\nFor right-moving, low = τ + s(T-8), high = h + s(T-8)\n\nSo τ + s(T-8) <= 0 <= h + s(T-8)\n\nNow, for each freeway, we can find T such that this holds.\n\nBut we need to know for which T it is dangerous to be on that freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 7: car (-48,-95,right,48)\n\nSo low = τ + s(T-8) = -95 + 48(T-8)\n\nhigh = h + s(T-8) = -48 + 48(T-8)\n\nSet low <= 0 <= high\n\n-95 + 48(T-8) <= 0 <= -48 + 48(T-8)\n\nFirst inequality: -95 + 48(T-8) <= 0 => 48(T-8) <= 95 => T-8 <= 95/48 = 1.979... so T-8 <= 1 since T integer? T is turn, integer.\n\nT-8 <= floor(95/48) = 1, since 48*1=48, 48*2=96>95, so T-8 <=1? Let's solve.\n\n-95 + 48(Δt) <= 0 where Δt = T-8\n\n48 Δt <= 95\n\nΔt <= 95/48 = 95÷48=1.979, so Δt <=1.979, since Δt integer, Δt <=1\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -48 + 48 Δt => 48 Δt >=48 => Δt >=1\n\nSo from low <=0: Δt <=1\n\nFrom 0 <= high: Δt >=1\n\nSo for Δt=1, low <=0 and 0<=high.\n\nAt Δt=1, low = -95 +48(1) = -95+48= -47\n\nhigh = -48 +48=0\n\nSo span [ -47, 0]\n\n0 <= high: 0 <=0, true.\n\nlow <=0: -47 <=0, true.\n\nSo at T=8+1=9, span is [-47,0], so 0 is included? high=0, so 0 is the endpoint.\n\nIs 0 included? The span is [low, high], so if high=0, then 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, if low=0, 0 included.\n\nSo at T=9, freeway 7 has span [-47,0], so 0 is in it.\n\nFor other Δt?\n\nAt Δt=0, T=8: low=-95, high=-48, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nAt Δt=1, T=9: low=-47, high=0, 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=2, T=10: low=-95+96=1, high=-48+96=48, 1 to 48, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=9, on freeway 7, collision if we are there.\n\nNow freeway 8: car (-48,-95,right,48)\n\nSame as freeway 7, since same parameters.\n\nh=-48, τ=-95, s=48\n\nSo same: at T=8: [-95,-48], 0 not in\n\nT=9: [-47,0], 0 in\n\nT=10: [1,48], 0 not in\n\nSo only dangerous at T=9.\n\nNow other freeways, but we might not go there, but let's see if we need to.\n\nFreeway 1: (24,13,right,12)\n\nτ=13, h=24, s=12\n\nlow = τ + s(Δt) =13 +12 Δt\n\nhigh = h + s Δt =24 +12 Δt\n\nSet low <=0 <= high\n\n13 +12 Δt <=0? But 13>0, 12Δt >=0, so low =13 +12Δt >=13>0, so low >0, so 0 < low <= high, so 0 never <= low, so 0 never in span, since min is 13 at Δt=0.\n\nSimilarly, for all Δt, low >=13>0, so 0 never in span. So freeway 1 is always safe, no car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (0,-11,right,6)\n\nτ=-11, h=0, s=6\n\nlow = τ + s Δt = -11 +6 Δt\n\nhigh = h + s Δt = 0 +6 Δt\n\nSet low <=0 <= high\n\nFirst, 0 <= high: 0 <= 6 Δt => Δt >=0\n\nSecond, low <=0: -11 +6 Δt <=0 => 6 Δt <=11 => Δt <= 11/6 ≈1.833, so Δt <=1\n\nSince Δt integer, Δt=0 or 1.\n\nAt Δt=0, T=8: low=-11, high=0\n\n-11 <=0 <=0, true, 0 included.\n\nAt Δt=1, T=9: low=-11+6=-5, high=0+6=6\n\n-5 <=0 <=6, true.\n\nAt Δt=2, T=10: low=-11+12=1, high=0+12=12, 0 not <= low=1? 0 <1, not in [1,12]\n\nSo at T=8 and T=9, 0 in span for freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3,4,5: all (0,-11,right,6), same as freeway 2.\n\nSo for k=2,3,4,5, dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway 6: (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nτ=-83, h=-48, s=36\n\nlow = -83 +36 Δt\n\nhigh = -48 +36 Δt\n\nSet low <=0 <= high\n\nlow <=0: -83 +36 Δt <=0 => 36 Δt <=83 => Δt <=83/36≈2.305, so Δt <=2\n\n0 <= high: 0 <= -48 +36 Δt => 36 Δt >=48 => Δt >=48/36=4/3≈1.333, so Δt >=2 since integer? Δt >= ceil(4/3)=2\n\nΔt >= 1.333, so since integer, Δt >=2\n\nAnd Δt <=2.305, so Δt=2\n\nAt Δt=1, T=9: low=-83+36= -47, high=-48+36= -12, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nAt Δt=2, T=10: low=-83+72= -11, high=-48+72=24\n\n-11 <=0 <=24, true.\n\nAt Δt=3, T=11: low=-83+108=25, high=-48+108=60, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=10, dangerous for freeway 6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 and 8 we did, dangerous only at T=9.\n\nFreeway 7: at T=9 only.\n\nFreeway 8: same.\n\nNow, we start at turn 8, y=7.\n\nAt turn 8, on freeway 7, which is safe at T=8, as we saw.\n\nWe want to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe at all times.\n\nTo go from y=7 to y=9, we need to be at y=8 at some point, or go directly? But actions are U, D, S, so to increase y, we need to go to y=8 first.\n\nFrom y=7, U to y=8, then from y=8, U to y=9.\n\nWe could go S at some point to wait.\n\nBut minimal turns, so probably go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 when it is dangerous.\n\nSpecifically, y=7 is dangerous only at T=9.\n\ny=8 is dangerous only at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, both y=7 and y=8 have cars at x=0.\n\nNow, at turn 8: we are at y=7, safe.\n\nWe choose action a_8.\n\nIf we choose U, then we go to y=8 at turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, we are on y=8.\n\nBut at T=9, y=8 has car with 0 in span, so collision!\n\nBecause freeway 8 at T=9 has span including 0.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose S at turn 8, we stay at y=7 at turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, on y=7, which also has car with 0 in span, collision.\n\nIf we choose D, go to y=6 at turn 9.\n\ny=6, freeway 6.\n\nAt T=9, freeway 6: earlier, for freeway 6, dangerous only at T=10.\n\nAt T=9, freeway 6: Δt=1, low=-83+36= -47, high=-48+36= -12, both negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nBut we are going down, away from target.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo at turn 8, if we do U, we go to y=8 at turn 9, collision.\n\nIf we do S, stay at y=7 at turn 9, collision.\n\nIf we do D, go to y=6 at turn 9, safe, but then we are at y=6, need to go to y=9, which takes more turns.\n\nBut we might avoid the dangerous time.\n\nDangerous only at T=9 for y=7 and y=8.\n\nBefore and after, safe.\n\nFor example, at T=8, y=7 safe.\n\nT=10, y=7: freeway 7 at T=10: Δt=2, low=-95+96=1, high=-48+96=48, [1,48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at T=10: same, safe.\n\ny=8 freeway same as y=7, but different freeway.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=10: low=-95+96=1, high=-48+96=48, [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nNow, to reach y=9.\n\nSince at T=9, both y=7 and y=8 are dangerous, we cannot be on them at turn 9.\n\nAt turn 8, we are at y=7.\n\nWe need to not be on y=7 or y=8 at turn 9.\n\nSo possible actions:\n\n- Do D at turn 8: go to y=6 at turn 9. Then at turn 9, we are on y=6, which is safe at T=9, as above.\n\nThen from there, we can go up to y=7,8,9.\n\nBut y=6 at T=9 safe, but at T=10, y=6 is dangerous? Freeway 6 dangerous at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, freeway 6 has 0 in span.\n\nNow, if we are at y=6 at turn 9, we choose action.\n\nIf we do U, go to y=7 at turn 10.\n\nAt turn 10, on y=7, which is safe, as [1,48] no 0.\n\nThen from y=7, we can go to y=8, then y=9.\n\nBut at turn 10, y=7 safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we do S at turn 9, stay at y=6 at turn 10, but at T=10, y=6 dangerous, collision.\n\nSo we need to not be on y=6 at T=10.\n\nSimilarly, other options.\n\nLet's list the safe times for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 6: dangerous only at T=10\n\nFreeway 7: dangerous only at T=9\n\nFreeway 8: dangerous only at T=9\n\nFreeways 2,3,4,5 dangerous at T=8 and T=9, but since we start at y=7, and not planning to go down, probably not issue.\n\nFreeway 1 always safe.\n\nNow, back to plan.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nIf no cars, we could go U at t=8 to y=8 at t=9, then U at t=9 to y=10, but y=10 not exist, y max 9.\n\nAt turn 8: y=7, U to y=8 at turn 9.\n\nBut at turn 9, y=8, collision, as above.\n\nCannot.\n\nS at t=8: stay y=7 at t=9, collision.\n\nD at t=8: go to y=6 at t=9.\n\nThen at turn 9, y=6, safe.\n\nNow, from turn 9, at y=6.\n\nWe need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut y=6 at T=9 safe, but at T=10, y=6 dangerous.\n\nSo we must not be on y=6 at turn 10.\n\nTherefore, at turn 9, we must leave y=6.\n\nActions: U, D, S.\n\nIf U, go to y=7 at turn 10.\n\ny=7 at T=10 is safe, as above.\n\nIf S, stay at y=6 at turn 10, collision.\n\nIf D, go to y=5 at turn 10.\n\ny=5, freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5: at T=10, Δt=2, freeway 5 has car (0,-11,right,6)\n\nAt T, low = τ + s(Δt) = -11 + 6(Δt)\n\nhigh = h + s(Δt) = 0 + 6(Δt)\n\nAt T=10, Δt=2, low=-11+12=1, high=0+12=12, [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nBut going down further.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo best to go U from y=6 at turn 9 to y=7 at turn 10.\n\nThen at turn 10, y=7, safe.\n\nNow, from y=7, we can go to y=8.\n\ny=8 at T=10 is safe, as above.\n\nThen from y=8 to y=9.\n\nNow, let's see the turns.\n\nStart: turn 8, y=7\n\nAction a_8 = D (down), so to y=6 at turn 9\n\nAt turn 9, y=6\n\nAction a_9 = U (up), to y=7 at turn 10\n\nAt turn 10, y=7\n\nThen action a_10 = U, to y=8 at turn 11\n\nAt turn 11, y=8\n\nThen action a_11 = U, to y=9 at turn 12\n\nAt turn 12, y=9\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H -1} =9\n\nt1=8, so y_{8 + H -1} =9\n\nAt turn 12, y=9, so 8 + H -1 =12 => 7 + H =12? 8 + H -1 =12 => H-1=4, H=5\n\nSequence: a_8, a_9, a_10, a_11\n\na_8 to a_{8+H-1}, for H=5, actions a_8 to a_{12}, but y_{8+5-1}=y_{12}=9\n\nActions: t=0 to H-1=4, so a_{8+0}=a_8, a_9, a_10, a_11, a_{12}? a_{8+4}=a_{12}\n\nBut after a_{12}, y_{13}, but we have y_{12}=9, which is after a_{11}, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the position timeline.\n\nTurn t: position y_t\n\nAction a_t determines y_{t+1}\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, then choose a_t, go to y_{t+1}\n\nNow, y_{t1 + H -1} =9\n\nt1=8, so y_{8 + H -1} =9\n\nThis is the position at turn 8 + H -1.\n\nAt that turn, we are at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 12, y=9.\n\nSo 8 + H -1 =12 => H-1=4, H=5\n\nActions: from t=0 to H-1=4, so a_{8}, a_{9}, a_{10}, a_{11}, a_{12}\n\nBut a_{12} is chosen at turn 12, when we are already at y=9, so we can choose S, for example.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to specify actions from a_8 to a_{12}, but a_12 might not be necessary if we reach at turn 12.\n\ny_{12}=9, which means at turn 12, before action, we are at y=9.\n\nThen we choose a_{12}, which could be S to stay, or U to stay, etc.\n\nBut the condition is satisfied at turn 12.\n\nWith actions: a_8=D, a_9=U, a_10=U, a_11=U, and at turn 12, we are at y=9, so a_{12} can be S, but we need to include it? The sequence has H actions.\n\nH=5 actions: a_8, a_9, a_10, a_11, a_{12}\n\na_{12} is at turn 12, when we are at y=9, so we can choose a_{12}=S to stay at y=9.\n\nSimilarly, in the path, we reached y=9 at turn 12.\n\nBut we could reach earlier?\n\nIn this path, we used 5 actions to reach at turn 12.\n\nBut turn 12 is 8 + H -1, H=5.\n\nIs there a faster way?\n\nFor example, can we reach by turn 10 or something.\n\nAt turn 8, y=7.\n\nIf we could be at y=9 earlier.\n\nBut to go from y=7 to y=9, minimum two U actions, but with cars, we have to avoid T=9.\n\nAt turn 9, we cannot be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nSo we must be elsewhere at turn 9.\n\nThe only other options are y=6 or y=9 or y=0, but y=9 is far.\n\ny=6 is below.\n\nOr we could go to y=5 or something, but worse.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 8, instead of going down, can we go up later.\n\nBut we have to skip turn 9 on y=7 or y=8.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are both dangerous only at T=9, we can be on them at other times.\n\nFor example, at turn 10, both safe.\n\nSo one way: at turn 8, do S? But if S, at turn 9, y=7, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nDo U, to y=8 at turn 9, collision.\n\nSo must move away.\n\nDown to y=6.\n\nThen from y=6 at turn 9, we need to go up, but to avoid y=6 at T=10.\n\nSo at turn 9, from y=6, do U to y=7 at turn 10.\n\nThen at turn 10, y=7, safe.\n\nNow from here, we can go directly to y=9? No, need to go to y=8 first.\n\nFrom y=7 at turn 10, do U to y=8 at turn 11.\n\nThen U to y=9 at turn 12.\n\nSame as before.\n\nFrom y=7 at turn 10, could we do double U or something, but no, each action one step.\n\nUnless we do U multiple times.\n\nBut each U increases y by one.\n\nSo from y=7 to y=8, one U, to y=9 another U.\n\nTakes two actions.\n\nIn the above, from turn 10 y=7 to turn 12 y=9.\n\nBut turn 10 to turn 12 is two turns: at turn 10, action to go to y=11? y=8 at turn 11, y=9 at turn 12.\n\nPerhaps we can be faster if we go to y=9 before turn 12.\n\nBut at turn 9, we are at y=6, which is not 9.\n\nTurn 8: y=7\n\nAfter a_8: if D, y=9? No, to y=6.\n\nThen after a_9: U to y=7 at turn 10.\n\nThen we need to go to y=8 and y=9.\n\nMinimum from y=7 to y=9 is two actions: to y=8 then y=9, so turns 11 and 12.\n\nUnless we can go to y=9 directly from somewhere.\n\nBut no.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps we can go to a different freeway at turn 9.\n\nFor example, at turn 8, instead of down, can we go to y=5 or something, but that takes more time to come back.\n\nWorse.\n\nPerhaps we can stay at y=7 but skip turn 9, but we can't, because at turn 9 we must be somewhere.\n\nUnless we move to y=9 at turn 9, but from y=7, we can't reach y=9 in one action.\n\nMaximum change is one per turn.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=9 before turn 10.\n\nAt turn 10: if we could be at y=9.\n\nBut from turn 8, to turn 10, two actions.\n\nIf we do U at turn 8, to y=8 at turn 9, but collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nDo nothing, stay at y=7 at turn 9, collision.\n\nDo D to y=6 at turn 9, then at turn 10, we can be at y=7 or y=5, not y=9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 10, we need to be at y=8 at turn 9, and do U, but at turn 9, y=8 collision.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=9 at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 11: to be at y=9 at turn 11, we need to be at y=8 at turn 10, and do U at turn 10 to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nAt turn 10, y=8: is it safe?\n\nFreeway 8 at T=10: as above, Δt=2, low=1, high=48, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at turn 10, we need to be at y=7 or y=9 or y=8 at turn 9, but y=9 not possible, y=8 at turn 9 collision, y=7 at turn 9 collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=8 at turn 10 directly from turn 9.\n\nThe only way is to be at y=7 at turn 10, then go to y=8 at turn 11.\n\nAs in the first plan.\n\nAt turn 11, y=8, safe, then U to y=9 at turn 12.\n\nSo we reach y=9 at turn 12.\n\nWith H=5 actions: a_8=D, a_9=U, a_10=U, a_11=U, and a_{12}=? For the last action.\n\ny_{12}=9 at turn 12.\n\nWe need to include a_{12} in the sequence.\n\nSince we are at y=9, we can set a_{12}=S.\n\nBut in the actions, a_8 to a_{12}, five actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn 11.\n\nIf at turn 11, y=9.\n\nThen we need to be at y=8 at turn 10, and do U at turn 10 to go to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nAt turn 10, y=8 must be safe, which it is at T=10.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at turn 10, we need to come from turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, we need to be at y=7 or y=9 or y=8 to go to y=8 at turn 10? Action: from position at turn 9, choose a_9, go to y_{10}.\n\nTo have y_{10}=8, we need to be at y_9=7,8, or9? If at y_9=7, do U to y10=8; y9=8, do S to y10=8; y9=9, do D to y10=8, but not efficient.\n\nBut at turn 9, we cannot be on y=7 or y=8 because collision.\n\ny=9 at turn 9: to be at y=9 at turn 9, we need to come from turn 8, at y=8 at turn 8, do U to y9=9.\n\nBut at turn 8, we are at y=7, not y=8.\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn 8, we need previous, but we start at turn 8 y=7.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=9 or y=8 at turn 9 directly.\n\nThus, cannot be at y=8 at turn 10.\n\nTherefore, the earliest we can be at y=9 is turn 12, with the path as above.\n\nBut in the path, we have a_8=D, a_9=U, a_10=U, a_11=U, then at turn 11, after a_11=U, we go to y=9 at turn 12.\n\nSo at turn 12, y=9.\n\nThen for the sequence, we need actions up to a_{12}, but a_{12} is at turn 12, when we are at y=9, so we can choose a_{12}=S.\n\nNow, H=5, since 5 actions.\n\nBut let's list the actions:\n\nTurn 8: a_8 = D  // to y=6 at t9\n\nTurn 9: a_9 = U  // to y=7 at t10\n\nTurn 10: a_10 = U // to y=8 at t11\n\nTurn 11: a_11 = U // to y=9 at t12\n\nNow, at turn 12, y=9, so we need to include a_12? For y_{8+H-1}=9.\n\nWith H=5, y_{8+5-1}=y_{12}=9, so we need to be at y=9 at turn 12, which we are.\n\nThe actions are a_8 to a_{12}, but a_{12} is chosen at turn 12, after we are already at y=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be fine, we set a_12=S.\n\nBut we can stop after a_11, but the sequence must include actions until we reach, but since we reach at turn 12, and action at turn 12 is separate.\n\nPerhaps H is the number of actions until we first reach y=9.\n\nIn the condition, y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so for example, if we reach at turn T, then T = t1 + H -1.\n\nWith T=12, t1=8, 12=8 + H -1 => H=5.\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1=4: a_8 to a_{11}? Indices.\n\nt from 0 to H-1: a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0: a_{t1 +0} = a_8\n\nt=1: a_{t1+1} = a_9\n\n...\n\nt=H-1: a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nNow, after these actions, we have y_{t1 + H} = y_{8+H}\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is the position at the beginning of turn t1 + H -1, or after action?\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, we are at y_{t1 + H -1}, then we choose a_{t1 + H -1}, then go to y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut y_{t1 + H -1} =9, meaning at the start of turn t1 + H -1, we are at 9, then we choose an action, which might keep us there or move.\n\nBut since we are already at 9, and the condition is satisfied.\n\nIn the action sequence, we include a_{t1 + H -1}, which is chosen at that turn.\n\nIn our case, for turn 12, which is t1 + H -1 =8 + H -1=12, so H-1=4, H=5.\n\nAt turn 12, we are at y=9, so we choose a_{12}, say S.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence, actions a_8 to a_{12}.\n\nBut in the path above, with a_8=D, a_9=U, a_10=U, a_11=U, and a_12=S.\n\nBut a_11=U is chosen at turn 11, when we are at y=8 (since after a_10=U, at turn 11 y=8), then a_11=U to go to y=9 at turn 12.\n\nThen at turn 12, y=9, a_12=S.\n\nWe could have a shorter sequence if we don't need the last action, but according to the definition, H includes actions until the turn we reach.\n\nPerhaps we can reach with fewer actions by not going down.\n\nAnother idea: what if at turn 8, we do nothing? But S, then at turn 9, y=7, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 via other paths, but no.\n\nOr, at turn 8, since we are at y=7, and it is safe, but we have to leave before turn 9.\n\nBut we can only move to adjacent y.\n\nSo only y=6 or y=8, but y=8 at turn 9 is bad.\n\ny=6 is the only choice.\n\nPerhaps we can move to y=6 and then to y=7 quickly, but we have to wait until turn 10 for y=7.\n\nFreeway 6 is dangerous at T=10, so we must be off y=6 by turn 10.\n\nAt turn 9, we are at y=6, must go to y=7 at turn 10.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nPerhaps from y=6 at turn 9, we can go to y=5, but then we need to come back, more turns.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo minimal is H=5.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach at turn 11.\n\nSuppose at turn 11, y=9.\n\nThen y_{11}=9.\n\nt1=8, so 8 + H -1 =11 => H-1=3, H=4.\n\nThen actions a_8, a_9, a_10, a_{11}\n\nNow, with these actions, y_{11}=9.\n\ny_{11} is position at turn 11.\n\nTo have y_{11}=9, we need that after action a_{10}, we are at y_{11}=9.\n\nAction a_{10} at turn 10, from y_{10}, to y_{11}.\n\nSo if y_{11}=9, it could be from y_{10}=8, a_{10}=U; or y_{10}=9, a_{10}=S or D, but D goes down.\n\nBut to reach y=9, probably from y=8.\n\nSo need y_{10}=8.\n\nSimilarly, y_{10}=8 must be from turn 9, y_9=7,8,9 with appropriate action.\n\nBut at turn 9, we cannot be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nIf y_9=9, then to have y_{10}=8, we do D, but y=9 at turn 9: to be at y=9 at turn 9, need from turn 8, y_8=8, a_8=U to y9=9.\n\nBut we start at y_8=7, not 8.\n\nSo impossible.\n\ny_9=7 or 8 not possible due to collision.\n\nThus, cannot have y_{10}=8 or y_9=9.\n\nTherefore, impossible to be at y=9 before turn 12.\n\nHence minimal H=5.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have a_8=D, a_9=U, a_10=U, a_11=U, and a_12=S.\n\nBut a_12 is part of the sequence for t=4, a_{8+4}=a_{12}.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list the actions.\n\nThe player position: at turn 8, y=7.\n\nAfter a_8=D, y=6 at turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, y=6, choose a_9=U, to y=7 at turn 10.\n\nAt turn 10, y=7, choose a_10=U, to y=8 at turn 11.\n\nAt turn 11, y=8, choose a_11=U, to y=9 at turn 12.\n\nAt turn 12, y=9, choose a_12=S, to stay y=9 at turn 13, but we don't care.\n\nNow, collision checks:\n\nAt turn 8: y=7, freeway 7 at T=8: span [-95,-48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt turn 9: y=6, freeway 6 at T=9: span low=-83+36(1)= -47, high=-48+36= -12, [-47,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt turn 10: y=7, freeway 7 at T=10: Δt=2, low=-95+96=1, high=-48+96=48, [1,48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt turn 11: y=8, freeway 8 at T=11: Δt=3, low=-95+144=49? T=11, t1=8, Δt=3.\n\nlow = τ + s Δt = -95 + 48*3 = -95 + 144 = 49\n\nhigh = h + s Δt = -48 + 144 = 96\n\n[49,96], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at turn 12: y=9, no car, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=4? We saw not.\n\nH=5 is minimal.\n\nIn the sequence, for a_12, we can set it to S, but since we reached at turn 12, and the action at turn 12 is not necessary for reaching, but according to the sequence definition, we need to include it because H=5 actions up to a_{12}.\n\nPerhaps we can set a_11 such that we reach at turn 11, but we can't.\n\nAnother thought: what if at turn 8, we do D to y=6 at turn 9.\n\nThen at turn 9, instead of U, we do nothing? But if S, stay at y=6 at turn 10, but at T=10, y=6 dangerous, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nOr do U to y=7 at turn 10, as before.\n\nThen from y=7 at turn 10, to y=8 at turn 11, to y=9 at turn 12.\n\nSame.\n\nPerhaps from y=6 at turn 9, we can go to y=7 at turn 10, then at turn 10, from y=7, if we could go directly to y=9, but no, only one step.\n\nSo must go through y=8.\n\nThus, minimal H=5.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the sequence.\n\nt1=8.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 8: a_8 = D\n\nTurn 9: a_9 = U\n\nTurn 10: a_10 = U\n\nTurn 11: a_11 = U\n\nTurn 12: a_12 = S  // since at y=9\n\nBut in the sequence, a_12 is included.\n\nIn the box.\n\nThe answer format: list for each turn.\n\nBut the turn numbers start from t1.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t1 +1}\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nIn this case, t1=8, H=5, so turns: 8,9,10,11,12? t1 + H -1 =8+5-1=12.\n\nActions: a_8 to a_{12}, but a_{t1 + H -1} = a_{12}\n\nFor t from 0 to H-1: a_{t1 + t}, so for t=0: a_8, t=1: a_9, t=2: a_10, t=3: a_11, t=4: a_{12}\n\nYes.\n\nSo we need to specify a_8, a_9, a_10, a_11, a_12.\n\nWith values: D, U, U, U, S.\n\nBut a_12=S is fine.\n\nWe could have a_12=U or D, but at y=9, U stays or error, but S is clear.\n\nNow, but in the action, at turn 11, we do U from y=8 to y=9, so at turn 12 we are at y=9.\n\nThen a_12=S.\n\nPerhaps we can stop after a_11, but the condition requires y_{t1+H-1}=9, with H=5, y_{12}=9, which is after a_11.\n\nIf we set H=4, then y_{8+4-1}=y_{11}=9, but we cannot achieve y_{11}=9.\n\nSo H=5 is correct.\n\nAnother path: what if we go to y=5 or something, but more turns.\n\nNo.\n\nOr, at turn 8, do D to y=6 at turn 9.\n\nThen at turn 9, do U to y=7 at turn 10.\n\nThen at turn 10, from y=7, instead of U, do something else, but we need to go up.\n\nIf we do S, stay at y=7 at turn 11, but at turn 11, y=7: freeway 7 at T=11, Δt=3, low=-95+144=49, high=-48+144=96, safe, but we are not progressing.\n\nThen later do U to y=8, etc., but takes more turns, worse.\n\nSo minimal is with H=5.\n\nThus, the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nBut in the output, we need to write the actions for the turns.\n\nNow, for the car on freeway 6, we used it, but it was safe.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5, we didn't go there, so no issue.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 8: & D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & S \\end{array} }\n\nBut the turn numbers: since t1=8, and we have up to turn 12.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be Turn t_1, Turn t_1 +1, ..., Turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nt1 + H -1 =8+5-1=12.\n\nYes.\n\nWe can write the actions only, but with turn labels.\n\nIn the box.\n\nPerhaps we don't need a_12, but I think we do.\n\nAnother idea: since at turn 11, after a_11=U, we go to y=9 at turn 12, so at turn 12, we are at y=9, which is the position, and we need to specify action for turn 12.\n\nBut in some interpretations, the sequence might stop when reached, but here it includes the action at the turn when we are already at goal.\n\nBut since we can choose S, it's fine.\n\nTo save one action, but not possible.\n\nSo I think H=5 is minimal.\n\nThus, the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 7)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) is 5, with the sequence of actions avoiding collisions as follows:\n\n- At turn 8, action \\(D\\) (down) moves the player to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 9. At turn 8, the player is on freeway 7, which has a span of \\([-95, -48]\\) at \\(T = 8\\), and 0 is not in this interval, so no collision occurs.\n- At turn 9, action \\(U\\) (up) moves the player to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 10. At turn 9, the player is on freeway 6, which has a span of \\([-47, -12]\\) at \\(T = 9\\), and 0 is not in this interval, so no collision occurs.\n- At turn 10, action \\(U\\) (up) moves the player to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 11. At turn 10, the player is on freeway 7, which has a span of \\([1, 48]\\) at \\(T = 10\\), and 0 is not in this interval, so no collision occurs.\n- At turn 11, action \\(U\\) (up) moves the player to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12. At turn 11, the player is on freeway 8, which has a span of \\([49, 96]\\) at \\(T = 11\\), and 0 is not in this interval, so no collision occurs.\n- At turn 12, action \\(S\\) (stay) keeps the player at \\(y = 9\\). Since \\(y = 9\\) has no cars, no collision occurs, and the position \\((0, 9)\\) is reached at turn 12.\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y_{12} = 9\\) (with \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 8 + 5 - 1 = 12\\)) and is minimal, as it is impossible to reach \\(y = 9\\) earlier (e.g., by turn 11) due to collisions on freeways 7 and 8 at turn 9.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 8: & D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & S \\end{array} }",

Collision happens if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, 0 is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the cars move. All cars are moving right, according to the table. Let me list them out:\n\n- Freeway 1: head 36, tail 25, right, speed 12\n\n- Freeway 2: head 6, tail -5, right, speed 6\n\n- Freeway 3: head 6, tail -5, right, speed 6\n\n- Freeway 4: head 6, tail -5, right, speed 6\n\n- Freeway 5: head 6, tail -5, right, speed 6\n\n- Freeway 6: head -12, tail -47, right, speed 36\n\n- Freeway 7: head 0, tail -47, right, speed 48\n\n- Freeway 8: head 0, tail -47, right, speed 48\n\nSince all are moving right, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)] for each car.\n\nt1 is 9, so for any turn T, the time elapsed is Δt = T - 9.\n\nFor freeway k, the span at T is:\n\n- k=1: [25 + 12(Δt), 36 + 12(Δt)]\n\n- k=2: [-5 + 6(Δt), 6 + 6(Δt)]\n\n- k=3: same as k=2, [-5 + 6(Δt), 6 + 6(Δt)]\n\n- k=4: same, [-5 + 6(Δt), 6 + 6(Δt)]\n\n- k=5: same, [-5 + 6(Δt), 6 + 6(Δt)]\n\n- k=6: [-47 + 36(Δt), -12 + 36(Δt)]\n\n- k=7: [-47 + 48(Δt), 0 + 48(Δt)] = [-47 + 48(Δt), 48(Δt)]\n\n- k=8: same as k=7, [-47 + 48(Δt), 48(Δt)]\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if I am on freeway y_T and 0 is within the span for that freeway at T.\n\nI start at y=6 at turn t1=9.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is the top, but y=9 has no cars, since cars are only on y=1 to 8. So once I'm on y=9, I'm safe, but I need to get there without colliding on the way.\n\nThe player position updates each turn based on action: U for up (y+1), D for down (y-1), S for stay (y same). And y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nI start at y=6. I need to get to y=9, so I need to move up at least 3 times. But I might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, but moving down might not help since I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince all cars are moving right and the spans are changing, I need to find when it's safe to be on each freeway.\n\nThe collision depends on whether 0 is in the span at exactly turn T for the freeway I'm on at that turn.\n\nAlso, note that when I move to a new freeway, I'm not on it until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo at turn T, I am only at risk from the freeway I am currently on, y_T.\n\nWhen I take an action at T, it determines y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I am on y_T, and I might collide if for y_T, 0 is in Span(T).\n\nThen at T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, and I check for that freeway at T+1, and so on.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from turn 9 onwards, with minimal H, such that after H-1 actions, I am at y=9. Since each action corresponds to one turn, starting from turn t1=9, after t actions, it's turn t1+t, and position after action at t1+t is for turn t1+t+1? Let's see the player update.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on action a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, I am at y_t, I take action a_t, then I move to y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nThe position is given for turn t1: (0, y_{t1}) = (0,6)\n\nSo at turn 9, I am at y=6.\n\nI take action a_9, which determines y_{10} = y_9 + Δy_9\n\nThen at turn 10, I am at y_{10}, take a_{10}, and so on, until I reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at turn T for some T, meaning that after the action at T-1, I am at y_T =9.\n\nSince I start at turn 9, y_9=6.\n\nAfter action at turn 9, y_{10} = y_9 + Δy_9\n\nAfter action at turn 9 + t, y_{10 + t} = y_{9+t} + Δy_{9+t}\n\nLet me define the turn index.\n\nSet t=0 for turn t1=9.\n\nSo at time τ = t - t1, where t is absolute turn.\n\nAt relative time τ = 0 (turn t1=9), position y=6.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + τ} for τ=0 to H-1, I have positions for τ=0 to H.\n\nPosition at time τ: y_τ for τ=0,1,2,... with y_0 =6.\n\nAfter action a_τ at time τ, I go to y_{τ+1} = y_τ + a_τ, where a_τ is U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\nI need y_H =9 for some H, with minimal H.\n\nH is the number of turns from t1, so after H actions, I am at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nSince I start at turn t1, after 0 actions, at turn t1, y=6.\n\nAfter first action at t1, I go to turn t1+1, y_{t1+1}.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn t1 + H, that means after H actions, I am at position for turn t1 + H.\n\nAnd y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t= t1 to t1 + H-1, so H actions.\n\nFor minimal H, since I need to go from 6 to 9, minimum H is 3 if I can go straight up without collision.\n\nBut I need to check if at y=6,7,8 there are cars that cause collision at the times I am there.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nTurn T is absolute turn, so for freeway k, at turn T, span is as above with Δt = T - 9.\n\n0 is in span if min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nSince all moving right, for each k, the span is [L_k(Δt), R_k(Δt)] where L is left end, R is right end.\n\n0 in span if L_k(Δt) <= 0 <= R_k(Δt)\n\nThen for that freeway k, at time T = 9 + Δt, if I am on k, I collide if the inequality holds.\n\nNow, for each k, let's find for which Δt the inequality holds.\n\nStart with k=1: span [25 + 12Δt, 36 + 12Δt]\n\nL = 25 + 12Δt, R = 36 + 12Δt\n\n0 <= L? 25 + 12Δt >0 for all Δt >=0, since min at Δt=0 is 25>0. So L >0 always, thus 0 < L <= R, so 0 not in span for any Δt. So freeway 1 is always safe? 0 <= L only if L<=0, but L=25+12Δt >=25>0, so indeed L >0, so 0 not in [L,R] since L>0. So freeway 1 never has collision.\n\nk=2: span [-5 + 6Δt, 6 + 6Δt]\n\nL = -5 + 6Δt, R = 6 + 6Δt\n\n0 in span if L <= 0 <= R\n\nL <=0: -5 +6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=5 => Δt <= 5/6 ≈0.833, so Δt=0 since Δt integer? Δt is integer because turns are discrete.\n\nΔt = T - t1, T and t1 integers, so Δt integer >=0.\n\nSo L <=0: -5 +6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=5 => Δt <= 5/6 <1, so for Δt=0, L=-5<=0.\n\n0 <= R: 0 <= 6 +6Δt, which is always true for Δt>=0.\n\nSo 0 in span when L <=0 and 0<=R.\n\nL <=0: -5 +6Δt <=0 => Δt <= 5/6, so only Δt=0\n\nAt Δt=0, L=-5, R=6, so 0 is between -5 and 6, yes.\n\nFor Δt=1, L=-5+6=1, R=6+6=12, L=1>0, so 0 not in [1,12].\n\nSimilarly for higher Δt.\n\nSo for k=2, collision at Δt=0 only, i.e., at turn T=9+0=9.\n\nSimilarly for k=3,4,5, same as k=2, since all have same parameters.\n\nk=3,4,5 all have head 6, tail -5, speed 6, same as k=2.\n\nSo for k=2,3,4,5, collision only at Δt=0, i.e., turn T=9.\n\nk=6: span [-47 +36Δt, -12 +36Δt]\n\nL = -47 +36Δt, R = -12 +36Δt\n\n0 in span if L <=0 <= R\n\nL <=0: -47 +36Δt <=0 => 36Δt <=47 => Δt <= 47/36 ≈1.305, so Δt=0 or 1\n\n0 <= R: 0 <= -12 +36Δt => 36Δt >=12 => Δt >= 12/36 = 1/3 ≈0.333, so for Δt>=1 since integer.\n\nNow, for Δt=0: L=-47, R=-12, L<=0, but R=-12<0, so 0 <= R? 0 <= -12? False, so 0 not <= R, thus not in span.\n\nAt Δt=0, R=-12 <0, so 0 > R, not <= R.\n\nL <=0 is true, but 0 <= R false since R<0.\n\nSo not in span.\n\nΔt=1: L= -47+36= -11, R= -12+36=24\n\nL=-11 <=0, R=24 >=0, so 0 in [-11,24], yes.\n\nΔt=2: L=-47+72=25, R=-12+72=60, both >0, L=25>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSo for k=6, collision at Δt=1, i.e., turn T=10.\n\nk=7: span [-47 +48Δt, 48Δt]  (since head 0 +48Δt, tail -47+48Δt)\n\nR = h + s Δt = 0 + 48 Δt = 48Δt\n\nL = τ + s Δt = -47 +48Δt\n\n0 in span if L <=0 <= R\n\nL <=0: -47 +48Δt <=0 => 48Δt <=47 => Δt <= 47/48 <1, so only Δt=0 possible? Δt integer.\n\nΔt=0: L=-47 <=0, R=0? R=48*0=0\n\n0 <= R: 0 <=0, true.\n\nSo L<=0 and 0<=R, so 0 in span at Δt=0.\n\nNow, is 0 included? Span is inclusive, I assume, since it says \"within the span\", and [L,R] includes endpoints.\n\nAt Δt=0, L=-47, R=0, so 0 is the right endpoint, so yes, 0 is in the span.\n\nFor Δt=1: L=-47+48=1, R=48, both >0, L=1>0, so 0 not in [1,48]\n\nSimilarly higher.\n\nSo for k=7, collision at Δt=0 only.\n\nSimilarly k=8 same as k=7.\n\nNow, back to k=1, we said no collision ever.\n\nk=2,3,4,5: collision only at Δt=0\n\nk=6: collision at Δt=1\n\nk=7,8: collision at Δt=0\n\nNow, I am starting at turn t1=9, which is Δt=0, on y=6.\n\ny=6 is freeway 6.\n\nAt turn 9, Δt=0, on y=6, which is k=6.\n\nFor k=6 at Δt=0: we have collision? Earlier for k=6 at Δt=0: L=-47, R=-12, both negative, 0 not in span since R<0, so no collision at Δt=0 for k=6.\n\nBut for k=7 and k=8, at Δt=0, collision, but I am on y=6, not on y=7 or 8.\n\nAt turn 9, I am on y=6.\n\nFor y=6 (k=6), at Δt=0, no collision, as above.\n\nBut let me confirm the car states.\n\nAt turn 9, for k=6: head -12, tail -47, direction right, so span [-47, -12]? But positions, since moving right, head is at -12, tail at -47, so the car is from x= -47 to x= -12, I assume, with x increasing right.\n\nThen 0 is not in [-47,-12], since -12<0? -12 is less than 0, so x from -47 to -12, all x<= -12 <0, so 0 not in the span.\n\nSimilarly, for k=7: head 0, tail -47, so span [-47, 0], so 0 is included, so if I am on y=7 at turn 9, I collide.\n\nSimilarly k=8 same.\n\nBut I am on y=6 at turn 9, so for y=6, no collision at turn 9.\n\nNow, I need to move to y=9.\n\nFirst, what about freeway 1, we said no collision, so y=1 is always safe.\n\ny=2,3,4,5: collision only at Δt=0, i.e., turn 9 only. So after turn 9, they are safe, because for Δt>=1, L>0.\n\nFor k=2, at Δt=1, L=1>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly k=3,4,5.\n\nk=6: collision at Δt=1, turn 10.\n\nk=7: collision at Δt=0, turn 9 only.\n\nk=8: same.\n\ny=7 and y=8 have collision only at turn 9, so after that safe.\n\ny=6 has collision at turn 10.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=6 to y=9.\n\nPossible paths: I can go up directly if possible.\n\nBut at turn 9, I am on y=6, safe.\n\nI take action at turn 9: if I go up, to y=7 at turn 10.\n\nBut at turn 10, if I am on y=7, what happens?\n\nAt turn 10, Δt = T - t1 = 10 - 9 =1.\n\nFor y=7 (k=7), at Δt=1: L = -47 +48*1 = -47+48=1, R=48*1=48, so span [1,48], L=1>0, so 0 not in span, so no collision at turn 10 for k=7.\n\nSimilarly for k=8.\n\nFor k=6 at Δt=1: collision, but I won't be on y=6 at turn 10 if I move.\n\nNow, back to action.\n\nAt turn 9 (τ=0), I am on y=6.\n\nI can take action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I take U, I go to y=7 at turn 10.\n\nAt turn 10, I am on y=7.\n\nFor y=7 at turn 10 (Δt=1), as above, no collision, since span [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nThen at turn 10, I can take another action.\n\nIf I take U again, go to y=8 at turn 11.\n\nAt turn 11, Δt=2.\n\nFor y=8 (k=8), at Δt=2: L = -47 +48*2 = -47+96=49, R=48*2=96, span [49,96], both >0, 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at turn 12.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so safe.\n\nSo in three moves: U at turn 9, U at turn 10, U at turn 11, to reach y=9 at turn 12.\n\nBut is there any collision?\n\nAt turn 9: on y=6, Δt=0, no collision as established.\n\nAction U at turn 9: so at turn 10, on y=7.\n\nAt turn 10: on y=7, Δt=1, for k=7, span [1,48], 0 not in, no collision.\n\nAction U at turn 10: to y=8 at turn 11.\n\nAt turn 11: on y=8, Δt=2, for k=8, span [49,96], 0 not in, no collision.\n\nThen action U at turn 11: to y=9 at turn 12.\n\nAt turn 12, on y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nAnd I reached in 3 turns: actions at turn 9,10,11, position at turn 12 is y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from turn 9 to turn 12, that's 3 actions? Turns: start turn 9, after 0 actions.\n\nAfter 1 action (turn 9), at turn 10, y=7\n\nAfter 2 actions (turn 9 and 10), at turn 11, y=8\n\nAfter 3 actions (turn 9,10,11), at turn 12, y=9.\n\nSo H=3, and I reached at turn t1 + H =9+3=12.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nWhat about y=6 at turn 10? At turn 10, if I were on y=6, I would collide, but I moved to y=7 at turn 10, so I'm not on y=6 at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nBut let me check if I need to consider the car on y=6 at other times.\n\nFor example, if I stay or something.\n\nBut in this case, direct up seems possible.\n\nBut the problem is to avoid collisions, and in this sequence, no collision occurred.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on y=6.\n\nk=6: collision at Δt=1, turn 10.\n\nBut at turn 10, I am on y=7, not y=6.\n\nAt turn 9, on y=6, no collision.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nBut what about other freeways? For example, if I go to y=5 or something, but I don't need to.\n\nMinimal H should be 3.\n\nBut let me see if H=2 is possible.\n\nCan I reach y=9 in 2 turns?\n\nFrom y=6, after two actions, y can be 8 if UU, or 7 if US or SU, etc., but to reach y=9, I need at least three up moves, since each up increases by 1.\n\nFrom y=6, to y=9, difference of 3, so minimum three U actions, so H at least 3.\n\nWith H=3, I can do U,U,U as above.\n\nI could do other sequences, like U,S,U but that would take more turns or same, but H=3 is minimal.\n\nWith H=3, I have to do three U to go from 6 to 9.\n\nIf I do D or S, y decreases or stays, so it would take more turns to reach 9.\n\nSo minimal H is 3, and U,U,U should work.\n\nBut in the action sequence, for turn 9,10,11.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions for turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nH=3, so actions at turn 9,10,11.\n\nEach U.\n\nBut let me write the sequence.\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nThen at turn 12, y=9.\n\nBut is there any car that could cause problem?\n\nEarlier I thought about freeway 2,3,4,5, but I didn't go there.\n\nIn this path, I only touched y=6 at turn 9, y=7 at turn 10, y=8 at turn 11, all safe at those times.\n\ny=7 at turn 10: Δt=1, safe.\n\ny=8 at turn 11: Δt=2, safe.\n\nBut what about y=7 at other times? For example, if I were on y=7 at turn 9, I would collide, but I wasn't.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to wait or something, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: the car on y=6 at turn 10 is dangerous, but I moved away.\n\nBut let me confirm the position.\n\nAt turn 9: y=6, take U, so for turn 10, y=7.\n\nNow, at turn 10, when I am on y=7, the car on y=7: at Δt=1, span [1,48], 0 not in, ok.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should list for each freeway and time when it is occupied.\n\nBut in this case, it seems fine.\n\nBut let me check freeway 6 at turn 10.\n\nAt turn 10, Δt=1, k=6 span: L= -47 +36*1 = -47+36= -11, R= -12+36=24, so [-11,24], 0 is between -11 and 24, so if I were on y=6 at turn 10, I collide.\n\nBut I am on y=7 at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 9, on y=6, Δt=0, span [-47,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nNow, what about the initial state: at turn 9, car on y=7 has head 0, tail -47, so at x=0, there is a car, so if I were on y=7 at turn 9, I collide, but I am not.\n\nIn my sequence, I never on y=7 at turn 9.\n\nSo should be ok.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I think it works.\n\nBut let me see if there is any constraint I missed.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y must be in [0,9], so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nFrom y=6, U to 7, U to 8, U to 9, all within bounds.\n\nIf I go up to 9, I can't go further, but I don't need to.\n\nSo H=3 should be achievable.\n\nBut let me see the car on y=8.\n\nAt turn 9, car on y=8: head 0, tail -47, so at x=0, car present, collision if on y=8 at turn 9.\n\nBut in my sequence, at turn 11, I am on y=8, turn 11, Δt=2.\n\nFor y=8, at Δt=2: L= -47 +48*2 = -47+96=49, R=96, so span [49,96], all positive, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster, but I can't, since min 3 steps.\n\nUnless I can jump, but no, only +1 per U.\n\nSo H=3 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have three actions.\n\nBut let me confirm the turns.\n\nt1=9\n\nAction at t1: turn 9\n\nAction at t1+1: turn 10\n\nAction at t1+2: turn 11\n\nThen at turn t1+3=12, position y=9.\n\nIn the answer format, it should list actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nH=3, so turns 9,10,11.\n\nActions: U for each.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nThe problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and H is the number of turns, I think.\n\nIn the task: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nAnd in the player, turns from t1 to t1+H-1 for actions.\n\nPosition at t1+H.\n\nIn this case, H=3.\n\nBut is there a way with H=2? No, because from y=6, after one action, y=7 at turn 10, after two actions, y=8 at turn 11, but I need to be at y=9, so I need a third action to reach y=9 at turn 12.\n\nIf I take no action, but I have to take actions.\n\nMinimal H is 3.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 at turn 11, but how?\n\nStart at turn 9, y=6.\n\nAfter action at turn 9, y_{10} = y9 + a9.\n\nIf a9=U, y10=7.\n\nThen at turn 10, y=7, take a10.\n\nIf a10=U, y11=8.\n\nThen need a11 to go to y12=9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 11, that would require after action at turn 10, y11=9.\n\nBut y11 depends on y10 and a10.\n\ny10 is at most 7 if I go U from 6, then y11 = y10 + a10 <=7 +1=8, since I can only increase by 1, so y11 <=8, cannot be 9 in two steps from 6.\n\ny9=6\n\ny10 = y9 + a9 <=6+1=7\n\ny11 = y10 + a10 <=7+1=8\n\ny12 = y11 + a11 <=8+1=9\n\nSo earliest at turn 12, y=9.\n\nThus H=3 is minimal.\n\nAnd with U,U,U, it seems collision-free.\n\nBut let me double-check for y=7 at turn 10.\n\nTurn 10: Δt=1\n\nFreeway y=7: k=7, span [-47 +48*1, 48*1] = [1,48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at turn 11: Δt=2, k=8, span [-47+96, 96] = [49,96], 0 not in, safe.\n\ny=6 at turn 9: Δt=0, k=6, span [-47,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAlso, I didn't go to other freeways.\n\nWhat about if I move down? But that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut the car on y=5, for example, at turn 9, collision, but I am not there.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 3, with actions U at turn 9, U at turn 10, U at turn 11.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 9: a_{9} = U\n\nTurn 10: a_{10} = U\n\nTurn 11: a_{11} = U\n\nThen at turn 12, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be up to turn t1 + H -1 =9+3-1=11.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, write in boxed.\n\nBut let me see if there is any mistake.\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 6 at turn 10 is dangerous, but I am not on it at that time.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 9, car on y=7 is dangerous, but I am on y=6.\n\nIn the initial state, at turn 9, for y=7, head at 0, so if I were on y=7, I collide, but I am not.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to avoid being on certain lanes at certain times, but in this case, not necessary.\n\nSo I think H=3 with three U actions.\n\nBut let me check the car speeds or something.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: we said no issue.\n\nBut I didn't use it.\n\nPerhaps I can go through other paths, but not needed.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) without colliding with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Movements and Collision Conditions\n- **Collision condition**: A collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) if the player is on freeway \\(y_T\\) and the car span on that freeway includes position \\(x = 0\\).\n- **Car spans at turn \\(T\\) (relative to \\(t_1 = 9\\), so \\(\\Delta t = T - 9\\))**:\n  - Freeway 1: Span = \\([25 + 12\\Delta t, 36 + 12\\Delta t]\\). Since \\(25 + 12\\Delta t > 0\\) for all \\(\\Delta t \\geq 0\\), 0 is never in the span. Thus, freeway 1 is always safe.\n  - Freeway 2, 3, 4, 5: Span = \\([-5 + 6\\Delta t, 6 + 6\\Delta t]\\). 0 is in the span only at \\(\\Delta t = 0\\) (turn 9), as:\n    - At \\(\\Delta t = 0\\): \\([-5, 6]\\), 0 is included.\n    - For \\(\\Delta t \\geq 1\\), the span has positive values (e.g., \\(\\Delta t = 1\\): \\([1, 12]\\)), so no collision.\n  - Freeway 6: Span = \\([-47 + 36\\Delta t, -12 + 36\\Delta t]\\). 0 is in the span only at \\(\\Delta t = 1\\) (turn 10), as:\n    - At \\(\\Delta t = 1\\): \\([-11, 24]\\), 0 is included.\n    - At other \\(\\Delta t\\), 0 is not in the span (e.g., \\(\\Delta t = 0\\): \\([-47, -12]\\), all negative; \\(\\Delta t = 2\\): \\([25, 60]\\), all positive).\n  - Freeway 7, 8: Span = \\([-47 + 48\\Delta t, 48\\Delta t]\\). 0 is in the span only at \\(\\Delta t = 0\\) (turn 9), as:\n    - At \\(\\Delta t = 0\\): \\([-47, 0]\\), 0 is included.\n    - For \\(\\Delta t \\geq 1\\), the span has positive values (e.g., \\(\\Delta t = 1\\): \\([1, 48]\\)), so no collision.\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) Minimally\n- The player starts at \\((0, 6)\\) at turn 9. To reach \\(y = 9\\), a minimum of 3 upward moves (U actions) are required, as each U increases \\(y\\) by 1, and \\(9 - 6 = 3\\).\n- The minimal \\(H\\) is 3, meaning the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(12\\) (after 3 actions from turn 9 to 11).\n- **Feasibility of U,U,U sequence**:\n  - **Turn 9 (\\(\\Delta t = 0\\))**: Start at \\(y = 6\\). Freeway 6 span at \\(\\Delta t = 0\\) is \\([-47, -12]\\), which does not include 0, so no collision. Action: U, moving to \\(y = 7\\) for turn 10.\n  - **Turn 10 (\\(\\Delta t = 1\\))**: At \\(y = 7\\). Freeway 7 span at \\(\\Delta t = 1\\) is \\([1, 48]\\), which does not include 0, so no collision. Action: U, moving to \\(y = 8\\) for turn 11.\n  - **Turn 11 (\\(\\Delta t = 2\\))**: At \\(y = 8\\). Freeway 8 span at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\) is \\([49, 96]\\), which does not include 0, so no collision. Action: U, moving to \\(y = 9\\) for turn 12.\n- At turn 12, \\(y = 9\\) with no cars on freeway 9, so the position is safe and the goal is reached.\n\n### Why Minimal and Safe?\n- \\(H = 3\\) is minimal because from \\(y = 6\\), it takes at least 3 actions to reach \\(y = 9\\) (each action changes \\(y\\) by at most 1).\n- No collisions occur in the sequence, as verified at each turn and position.\n- Alternative sequences (e.g., including S or D actions) would require \\(H > 3\\) to reach \\(y = 9\\), so they are not minimal.\n\n### Action Sequence\n- Actions for turns \\(t_1 = 9\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 11\\):\n  - Turn 9: U (move up to \\(y = 7\\))\n  - Turn 10: U (move up to \\(y = 8\\))\n  - Turn 11: U (move up to \\(y = 9\\))\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ } U }",

The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nNote: The collision rule says that at turn T, if the player is at (0, y_T) and there is a car on freeway y_T such that 0 is in the car's span at that exact turn T, then collision occurs.\n\nAlso, when moving from y to y' at turn T, note:\n- At the moment of the move (during turn T), we are still on y until the move is done. So at turn T, we are at y and then we move to y' for the next turn. Therefore, at turn T, we are on freeway y and we check the car on that freeway at turn T. Then at turn T+1, we are on freeway y' and we check the car on that freeway at turn T+1.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=10. We need to compute the car positions at future turns.\n\nThe car update:\n- For a left-moving car (direction left): at time T, span = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n- For a right-moving car (direction right): at time T, span = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the table gives the state at t1=10.\n\nLet's list all cars at t1=10:\n\nFreeway 1: (h=48, tau=37, d=right, s=12) -> right-moving, so at time T, span = [37 + 12*(T-10), 48 + 12*(T-10)]\nBut note: the table says \"head h, tail tau\", and for right-moving, the head is the front (so larger coordinate) and tail is the back. However, in the update rule for right-moving, it says: \n  Initially: span(t1) = [tau, h] -> then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for freeway 1 at T: [37 + 12*(T-10), 48 + 12*(T-10)]\n\nSimilarly for others:\n\nFreeway 2: (h=12, tau=1, d=right, s=6) -> [1 + 6*(T-10), 12 + 6*(T-10)]\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2: [1 + 6*(T-10), 12 + 6*(T-10)]\nFreeway 4: same: [1 + 6*(T-10), 12 + 6*(T-10)]\nFreeway 5: same: [1 + 6*(T-10), 12 + 6*(T-10)]\nFreeway 6: (h=24, tau=-11, d=right, s=36) -> [-11 + 36*(T-10), 24 + 36*(T-10)]\nFreeway 7: (h=48, tau=1, d=right, s=48) -> [1 + 48*(T-10), 48 + 48*(T-10)]\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: [1 + 48*(T-10), 48 + 48*(T-10)]\n\nWe start at y=7 at turn 10. We can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). We need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of moves without any cars would be 2 moves up: U, U. But we must avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe will be on freeway 7 when at y=7, freeway 8 when at y=8, and then we want to be at y=9 (which is the goal, and note there is no freeway at y=9? Actually, the freeways are from y=1 to y=8. So when we are at y=9, we don't have to worry about cars. However, during the move:\n\n- At turn T, we are on a freeway y_T and we must check the car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nOur path:\n\nWe start at turn 10 at y=7. We are on freeway 7 at turn 10.\n\nWe plan to move to y=8 at turn 11 (so at turn 11 we are at y=8, which is freeway 8) and then to y=9 at turn 12.\n\nBut we must check:\n\n- At turn 10: we are at y=7 -> check freeway 7 at turn 10: car on freeway7: [1 + 48*(10-10), 48+48*(0)] = [1,48]. Is 0 in [1,48]? No, because 0 < 1. So safe.\n\n- At turn 11: we are at y=8 -> check freeway 8 at turn 11: [1+48*(11-10), 48+48*(1)] = [1+48, 48+48] = [49,96]. Is 0 in [49,96]? No.\n\nThen at turn 12 we are at y=9 and done.\n\nSo the sequence: \nTurn 10: U (to go to 8 at next turn, so at turn11 we are at 8)\nTurn 11: U (to go to 9 at turn12)\n\nBut wait: at turn10 we are at 7, then we move U so at turn11 we are at 8. Then at turn11 we move U so at turn12 we are at 9.\n\nHowever, note that at turn11 we are at y=8 and we check freeway8 at turn11: [49,96] -> safe.\n\nBut what about the intermediate moves? We also need to check when we are at a freeway during the turn.\n\nBut note: when we are at turn10, we are at y=7 and we are safe (as above). Then we move to y=8 at the next turn. So at turn11, we are at y=8 and we check freeway8 at turn11: safe.\n\nSo H=2 turns? But wait, the sequence of actions: we start at turn10, and we take actions at turn10 and turn11, then at turn12 we are at 9. So we need two actions.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway7 at turn10: [1,48] -> 0 is not in [1,48] -> safe.\n\nFreeway8 at turn11: [49,96] -> safe.\n\nWhat about freeway7 at turn11? We are not on freeway7 at turn11, so we don't care.\n\nBut wait: what if we stay at a freeway for multiple turns? In this plan we are only at freeway7 at turn10 and freeway8 at turn11.\n\nBut note: we are starting at turn10 at y=7. Then we move to y=8 at turn11. Then at turn11 we are at y=8 and then we move to y=9 at turn12.\n\nHowever, we must also consider if we are going to be on freeway8 at turn11: yes, and we checked.\n\nBut is there any car on freeway7 that might hit us at turn10? We checked and it's safe.\n\nBut wait: the car on freeway6? We never step on freeway6? We are at y=7 and then y=8, so we skip freeway6 (which is y=6). So we don't care.\n\nBut wait: what if we go from 7 to 8? We are only on freeway7 at turn10 and freeway8 at turn11.\n\nSo the plan seems safe.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway6 at turn10? We are at y=7, so we don't check freeway6. Similarly, at turn11 we are at y=8, so we don't check freeway6.\n\nBut wait, what if we do a different move? We don't need to because we can go in 2 moves.\n\nBut is there a problem? Let me check the car on freeway7 at turn10: [1,48] -> safe.\n\nBut what about if we stay at y=7 for more turns? Then we would have to check at that turn. But we are leaving immediately.\n\nBut wait: what if we move down? We are at 7 and we want to go to 9, so down would be counterproductive.\n\nSo the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". And we are at y=7 at turn10 and y=8 at turn11, both safe.\n\nBut wait: let me check the car on freeway8 at turn10? We are not at freeway8 at turn10, so we don't care. Similarly, freeway7 at turn11: we are not there at turn11.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nBut note: after two moves, at turn12 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning that at t=0 (which is t1) we take the first action, then at t=1 (t1+1) we take the next, and so on until we have taken H actions and then we are at the goal at the next state (so after H actions we have moved H steps and the state at time t1+H is the goal).\n\nBut note: we start at t1=10, and we are at (0,7). Then we take action a10 at turn10, which moves us to y8 at turn11. Then we take action a11 at turn11, which moves us to y9 at turn12. So at turn12 we are at (0,9). Therefore, H=2.\n\nBut let me check if there is any car that might be at 0 at turn10 or turn11 on the freeways we are on.\n\nWe are on freeway7 at turn10: car7 at turn10: [1,48] -> 0 not in [1,48] -> safe.\n\nWe are on freeway8 at turn11: car8 at turn11: [1+48*(11-10)=49, 48+48=96] -> 0 not in [49,96] -> safe.\n\nBut what about the other cars? We are not on those freeways, so we don't care.\n\nBut wait: what if a car spans across 0 at the exact turn we are on that freeway? We have checked.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway6? It's at y=6. We are never on y=6 during our moves? We start at 7 and go to 8 and then 9. So we skip 6.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 1-5: we are not on them.\n\nBut wait: what if we go from 7 to 8? We are only at 7 and 8.\n\nBut note: at turn10 we are at 7, then we move to 8 at turn11. So we are only at freeway7 at turn10 and freeway8 at turn11.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and H is the number of actions. Since we need to go up twice, 2 is minimal.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway7 at turn10: safe. But what if we consider the car on freeway7 at turn10: [1,48] is the span. The car is moving right, so at turn10, the car covers x from 1 to 48. We are at x=0, so we are not in the car.\n\nSimilarly, at turn11 on freeway8: the car is from 49 to 96, which is far away.\n\nBut wait: what if the car on freeway8 at turn10? We are not on freeway8 at turn10, so we don't check.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway8 at turn10: [1+48*0, 48+48*0] = [1,48]. Then at turn11: [49,96]. So at turn10, freeway8 has a car from 1 to 48, but we are at freeway7 at turn10, so we don't care.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe.\n\nBut wait: the car on freeway6? It's at y=6. We are at y=7 and then y=8. So we never step on y=6. So we don't care.\n\nBut what if we had to step on y=6? We don't.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in 1 turn? That would be moving from 7 to 9 in one turn? But the moves are only +1, -1, or 0. So we can only move one step per turn. So we cannot jump from 7 to 9 in one move. Therefore, minimal H=2.\n\nBut wait: what if we move up twice? That's two moves.\n\nBut note: we are at turn10 at y=7. Then we do U at turn10: at turn11 we are at y=8. Then we do U at turn11: at turn12 we are at y=9. So we need two moves.\n\nBut what if we do a different sequence? For example, move up then stay? Then we would be at y=8 at turn11 and then at turn12 we are still at y=8? Then we haven't reached 9. So we must do two ups.\n\nBut wait: what if we do a down? That would be moving away.\n\nSo only two ups.\n\nBut let me check if there is any danger if we stay? For example, if we do:\n\nOption: Stay at 7 for one turn? Then at turn10: we are at 7 -> safe. Then at turn11: we are still at 7 -> then we must check freeway7 at turn11: [1+48*(11-10)=49, 48+48=96] -> 0 not in [49,96] -> safe. Then we can move up at turn11 to 8 at turn12, and then at turn12 we are at 8 -> check freeway8 at turn12: [1+48*(12-10)=97, 48+48*2=144] -> safe. Then at turn12 we move up again to 9 at turn13. That would take 3 moves: S, U, U. But that is longer than 2.\n\nSo minimal is 2.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", meaning minimal H such that after H actions we are at 9. So for H=2: we are at 9 at turn12.\n\nBut let me re-examine the car on freeway7 at turn10: [1,48] -> safe.\n\nBut what about the car on freeway7 at turn11? We are not at freeway7 at turn11, so we don't care.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8 at turn10: we are not there.\n\nBut wait: there is a car on freeway6 at turn10: [ -11 + 36*(10-10)= -11, 24+0=24 ] -> [-11,24]. This car is on freeway6 (y=6) at turn10. But we are at y=7, so we don't check. However, if we were to go down to y=6 at some point, we would have to check. But we are not going down.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut wait: what if the car on freeway6 at turn10 spans from -11 to 24, which includes 0? Yes, 0 is in [-11,24]. But we are at y=7 at turn10, so we are not on freeway6. Therefore, we are safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn11: freeway6: [-11+36*1=25, 24+36=60] -> [25,60] -> 0 not in there. So even if we were at freeway6 at turn11, it would be safe. But we are not.\n\nSo the minimal plan is two moves up.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway5? It's at y=5. We are never at y=5. Similarly, freeway4,3,2,1: we are at y=7 and then 8, so we skip them.\n\nBut wait: what if we consider the possibility that the cars might be long and moving? For example, the car on freeway1: at turn10: [37+12*0, 48+0] = [37,48] -> safe at turn10. At turn11: [37+12=49,48+12=60] -> safe. But we are not on freeway1.\n\nSo I think the plan is safe.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway2,3,4,5: at turn10: [1,12] (since 1+0=1, 12+0=12). Then at turn11: [1+6=7, 12+6=18]. Then at turn12: [1+12=13,12+12=24]. So at turn10, 0 is not in [1,12]. At turn11, [7,18] does not contain 0. At turn12, [13,24] does not. So even if we were at freeway2,3,4,5 at any of these turns, we would be safe? But we are not.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut wait: the problem says that we start at (0,7) at turn10, and we need to reach (0,9). We can do that in two moves: U at turn10 and U at turn11.\n\nBut note: after the first U, at turn11 we are at (0,8). Then we do U at turn11 to get to (0,9) at turn12.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nBut let me write it in the boxed format.\n\nBut wait: what if there is a problem with freeway7 at turn10? The car is from 1 to 48, and we are at 0 -> safe.\n\nBut note: the car on freeway7 at turn10 is [1,48]. The player is at x=0, which is not in [1,48]. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8 at turn11: [49,96] -> 0 is not in there.\n\nBut wait: what if we do the moves and we are at freeway7 at turn10 and then freeway8 at turn11, but what if at turn11 we are at freeway8 and the car is at [49,96]? We are at x=0, which is not in [49,96]. So safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is two moves.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if we can do it in one move? No, because we can only move one step per move.\n\nOr if we move up and then we have to avoid something? But we don't.\n\nBut what if we move up and then we are at freeway8 at turn11: the car on freeway8 at turn11 is [49,96] -> safe.\n\nBut note: there is a car on freeway8 at turn10: [1,48]. But we are at freeway7 at turn10, so we don't care.\n\nBut what if we had stayed at freeway8 at turn10? We didn't.\n\nSo I think it's safe.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". And we are at y=7 and then y=8, which are in that range. And we checked the cars on those freeways at the turns we are there.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nBut let me check the turn numbering: the sequence of actions for t=0 to H-1, where t=0 corresponds to turn t1=10, t=1 to turn11. So we have two actions: at turn10 and turn11.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So for t=0: a_{t1+0}=a10, t=1: a_{t1+1}=a11. And H=2.\n\nAnd we are done at turn t1+H = 10+2 = 12, at which we are at (0,9).\n\nSo this is correct.\n\nBut wait: I just noticed that the car on freeway6 at turn10: it spans [-11,24] which includes 0. And freeway6 is y=6. But we are at y=7 at turn10, so we are safe. However, if we were to move down to y=6 at turn10, then we would be at freeway6 at turn10 and we would collide. But we are not moving down.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2 and the sequence is U, U.\n\nBut let me see if there is any reason we must take more than 2? For example, if we had to avoid a car that would be at freeway8 at turn11? But we saw the car is at [49,96] which is safe.\n\nBut wait: what if the car on freeway8 at turn11 is [49,96] and we are at 0, so safe.\n\nBut note: the car on freeway7 at turn11: [49,96] -> safe, but we are not at freeway7 at turn11.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut just to be extra cautious, let me check the car on freeway7 at turn10: [1,48] -> safe.\n\nAt turn11: [49,96] -> safe.\n\nFreeway8 at turn10: [1,48] -> safe (but we are not on it).\n\nAt turn11: [49,96] -> safe (and we are on it).\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U\n}\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) each turn, changing the y-coordinate by \\(+1\\), \\(-1\\), or \\(0\\) respectively, while staying within the bounds \\(y \\in [0, 9]\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Initial state at turn 10**: Player is at (0, 7) (freeway 7).\n- **Target state**: (0, 9) (no freeway at y=9, so no collision check needed).\n- **Minimal moves without obstacles**: Two consecutive \"U\" actions move the player from y=7 to y=8 at turn 11, and then to y=9 at turn 12. Thus, \\(H = 2\\) is theoretically minimal.\n- **Collision avoidance**: Must ensure no collision occurs on freeways 7 (at turn 10) and 8 (at turn 11), as these are the only freeways occupied during the moves.\n\n#### Car positions (computed using update rules):\n- **Freeway 7 at turn 10** (player's starting freeway):  \n  Car state: \\((h=48, \\tau=1, d=\\text{right}, s=48)\\)  \n  Span at \\(T\\): \\([\\tau + s(T-10), h + s(T-10)]\\)  \n  At \\(T=10\\): \\([1 + 48(0), 48 + 48(0)] = [1, 48]\\)  \n  Player at (0, 7): x=0 not in [1, 48] → **safe**.\n  \n- **Freeway 8 at turn 11** (player moves to y=8 at turn 11):  \n  Car state: \\((h=48, \\tau=1, d=\\text{right}, s=48)\\)  \n  At \\(T=11\\): \\([1 + 48(1), 48 + 48(1)] = [49, 96]\\)  \n  Player at (0, 8) at turn 11: x=0 not in [49, 96] → **safe**.\n\n- **Other freeways (1–6)**:  \n  The player is never on freeways 1–6 during turns 10–11, so no collision checks are needed. For completeness:\n  - Freeway 6 at turn 10: \\([ -11 + 36(0), 24 + 36(0) ] = [-11, 24]\\) (contains x=0, but player not on y=6).\n  - All other cars (freeways 1–5) have spans not containing x=0 at turns 10–11.\n\n### Plan:\n- **Turn 10**: Action \\(U\\) moves player to (0, 8) at turn 11.  \n  Collision check on freeway 7 at turn 10: safe (as above).\n- **Turn 11**: Action \\(U\\) moves player to (0, 9) at turn 12.  \n  Collision check on freeway 8 at turn 11: safe (as above).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 2\\) turns (actions at turns 10 and 11), which is minimal since each move changes y by at most 1, and y must increase from 7 to 9.\n\n### Answer:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U\n}",

Each move changes y by +1, -1, or 0, but y is clamped between 0 and 9. Since I'm at y=8 and want to go to y=9, moving up once should do it, but I need to make sure that when I move to y=9, I don't collide with anything. But y=9 has no cars, so it should be safe. The collision only happens if I'm on a freeway y=1 to 8 and at that turn, for the car on that row, 0 is in the car's span.\n\nBut when I move to a new y, I'm not on that y until the next turn. Let me read the collision rule carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's y position at turn T.\n\nAlso, note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThis is a bit tricky. Let me parse this.\n\nSuppose at turn T, I am at position y_T. I choose an action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThen, at turn T, I am on row y_T, so I can collide with cars on row y_T if 0 is in the span for that row at turn T.\n\nAfter I move, at turn T+1, I am on row y_{T+1}, and I can collide with cars on row y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe note says that if I move to a different row at turn T, meaning y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1}, so even if cars on y_{T+1} have 0 in span at T, it doesn't affect me because I'm not on that row yet. I'm only vulnerable to the row I'm currently on.\n\nSimilarly, when I arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, I am on that row at that turn, so I need to avoid collision there.\n\nIn this case, I start at y=8 at turn t=11. I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no cars there, so once I'm on y=9, I'm safe.\n\nBut to get to y=9, I need to move up from y=8 at some turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn.\n\nLet τ = t - t1, so at τ=0, t=t1=11, y=8.\n\nI need to find H such that at some turn, y = 9, and it should be minimal H.\n\nSince y=9 is adjacent and no cars on y=9, the quickest way should be to move up immediately at τ=0.\n\nBut I need to check if at τ=0, when I am at y=8, is there a collision?\n\nAt turn t=11, y=8, I am on freeway 8.\n\nFor freeway 8, there is a car: (96, 49, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so it's moving right, meaning increasing.\n\nSpan at time T: for right-moving, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]? Let's see the update.\n\nThe car state is given at t1=11.\n\nFor car on freeway k, at turn T > t1, span is:\n\nLeft-moving: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nRight-moving: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, it says (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor right-moving, head is larger? Let's see the example.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (60,49,right,12), so head=60, tail=49, since it's right-moving, head should be the front, so when moving right, head is larger, tail smaller.\n\nIn the span update: for right-moving, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nτ is tail, h is head.\n\nSimilarly for left.\n\nAt t1, span is [τ, h] for right-moving, I assume, since head h is larger.\n\nIn the update: at T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, at t1, when T=t1, span should be [τ, h].\n\nIn freeway 1 at t1: head=60, tail=49, so span [49,60] I think? But it says (60,49), which might be (head,tail), so if head=60, tail=49, and direction right, so at t1, the car is from x=49 to x=60? But usually, tail to head, so min to max.\n\nIn the span definition, for right-moving, it says span(t1) = [τ, h], but τ is tail, h head, so if tail=49, head=60, span is [49,60].\n\nThen at T, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [49 + s(T-t1), 60 + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is at (0, y_T) and for the car on that freeway y_T, 0 is in span(T).\n\nThat is, min_span(T) <= 0 <= max_span(T).\n\nNow for freeway 8 at t1=11: car (96,49,right,48) so tail=49, head=96, speed=48.\n\nDirection right, so at time T, span(T) = [49 + 48*(T-11), 96 + 48*(T-11)]\n\nCollision at T if y_T = 8 and 0 ∈ [49 + 48(T-11), 96 + 48(T-11)]\n\nBut 49 + 48(T-11) is always positive for T >=11, since at T=11, 49>0, and increasing, so min_span >0, so 0 is never in the span for T>=11. So on freeway 8, at turn t=11 and later, the car is always to the right, x>0, so no collision possible on row 8 for T>=11.\n\nSimilarly, I need to check other rows if I move around.\n\nBut in this case, I start at y=8, and I want to move to y=9.\n\nAt turn τ=0 (t=11), I am at y=8. Since no collision on row 8, I can be there safely.\n\nThen I can choose action: if I choose U, then y_{τ=1} = 8 +1 =9.\n\nAt turn τ=0, t=11, I am at y=8, no collision.\n\nThen after action, at turn τ=1, t=12, I am at y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no cars, so no collision possible. So I should be at (0,9) at turn t=12, with H=1? H is the number of turns, I think.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so for H turns, I need actions for t from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nLet's see the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor H=1, t1 + H -1 = t1 +1 -1 = t1, so at turn t1, y should be 9. But at turn t1, I am at y=8, so I need to move to y=9 at some later turn.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9, which is at turn index t1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t1, y=8, so if H=1, y_{t1 +1 -1} = y_{t1} =8, not 9. So H must be at least 2? No.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt t=t1, y=8.\n\nAfter one action, at t=t1+1, y could be 9 if I move up.\n\nSo at turn t=t1+1, y=9.\n\nNow, t=t1+1 = t1 + H -1, so H-1 =1, thus H=2.\n\nSequence: at t=t1, action a_{t1}, then at t=t1+1, position after action.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, before action, position is (0,y_t).\n\nThen I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at (0,y_{t+1}).\n\nAnd collision is checked at each turn t based on y_t.\n\nFor me to be at y=9 at some turn T, that is, at turn T, y_T =9.\n\nIn the target, y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so at turn t=t1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nAt t=t1, y=8.\n\nIf I do nothing, S, y stays 8.\n\nIf I move U at t=t1, then at t=t1+1, y=9.\n\nSo at turn t=t1+1, y=9, which is t1 + H -1, so t1+1 = t1 + H -1, thus 1 = H -1, H=2.\n\nAnd the sequence is one action: a_{t1} = U.\n\nThen at turn t=t1+1, I am at y=9.\n\nNow, I need to ensure that during this, no collision.\n\nAt turn t=t1=11, y=8.\n\nOn row 8, car: as above, span at T=11: [49 +48(0), 96+48(0)] = [49,96], min=49>0, so 0 not in span, no collision.\n\nThen I move U, so at turn t=12, y=9.\n\ny=9, no freeway, no cars, so safe.\n\nSo in one move, I reach y=9 at t=12.\n\nBut H=2? With one action.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think it includes the starting point or not.\n\nLet's see the sequence: actions from t=0 to H-1, meaning H actions? t from 0 to H-1, that's H steps.\n\nIn the sequence {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, that's H actions, leading to position after H actions, at turn t1 + H.\n\nThe position after k actions is at turn t1 + k.\n\nAt turn t1, before any action, position is given.\n\nAfter first action at t1, position at t1+1.\n\nAfter second action at t1+1, position at t1+2, and so on.\n\nWe want position at turn t1 + H -1 to be (0,9).\n\nFor example, at turn t1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nIf H=1, turn t1 +1 -1 = t1, y should be 9, but at t1, y=8, not 9.\n\nIf H=2, turn t1 +2-1 = t1+1, y=9 possible.\n\nWith action at t1: U, then at t1+1, y=9.\n\nIf I do S at t1, y stays 8 at t1+1, not 9.\n\nThen I need later actions.\n\nBut in this case, with U at t1, I can be at y=9 at t1+1.\n\nNow, is there any reason I cannot do this? Only if at t1, on row 8, there is a collision, but as above, no.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if moving to y=9 is safe, but y=9 has no cars, so once I'm there, it's fine.\n\nThe only collision point is when I am on a freeway row at some turn.\n\nIn this move, I am only on row 8 at turn t=11, which is safe.\n\nThen at turn t=12, on row 9, safe.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nBut let me check the other cars to be thorough.\n\nThe cars are on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nI am only concerned with row 8 at t=11, which we have.\n\nOther rows not relevant for this move.\n\nPerhaps I should verify if row 9 is indeed no freeway.\n\nThe vertical axis y=0,1,2,...,9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I assume safe.\n\ny=0 might have something, but not specified, so probably safe.\n\nIn this case, moving up immediately should work with H=2, one action U.\n\nBut H=2 turns: turn t1 and t1+1, but the action is only at t1.\n\nThe minimal H should be 2.\n\nBut let me see if H=1 is possible, but no, as above.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 at t1, but I start at y=8, so impossible.\n\nSo H=2 is minimal.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and with one move, I do.\n\nBut why are there other cars listed? Maybe for other rows, but in this case, I don't need to go to other rows.\n\nPerhaps I misread the position.\n\nStart at (0,8), want (0,9).\n\nBut let me see the car on row 8: it's at x=49 to 96 at t=11, moving right, so at later times, even farther right, so no issue.\n\nBut row 8 has a car, but at t=11, it's not at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, other rows have cars, but I'm not on them.\n\nFor example, row 7 has car (96,49,right,48), same as row 8? No, row 7: (96,49,right,48), row 8 same? Let's see the table.\n\nFreeway 7: (96,49,right,48)\n\nFreeway 8: (96,49,right,48) same.\n\nBut different rows.\n\nBut I don't care if I'm not on those rows.\n\nIn this direct move, I only touch row 8 at t=11.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nBut perhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nSo for H=2, actions: at turn t1=11, action U.\n\nThen at turn t=12, y=9.\n\nThe sequence should be for t from t1 to t1+H-1, but H=2, so t=t1 and t1+1? t from 0 to H-1, so for H=2, t=0 and t=1? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for H=2, t=0 and t=1: a_{t1} and a_{t1+1}.\n\nBut in this case, I only need one action at t1 to move to y=9 at t1+1.\n\nAt t1+1, when I am at y=9, I don't need to do anything, but I might need to specify an action for that turn? No.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and after H actions, I am at turn t1+H.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t} is position at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, position is y_t.\n\nAfter action at t, position at t+1 is y_{t+1}.\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T=9, and T = t1 + H -1.\n\nFor T = t1+1, y=9, so H-1=1, H=2.\n\nNow, the actions: at turn t1, I need to set a_{t1} such that y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + delta y.\n\nIf a_{t1} = U, y_{t1+1} =9.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, I am at y=9, which is the target turn.\n\nFor the sequence, I need actions for t from t1 to t1+H-1, which is t1 and t1+1 for H=2.\n\nBut at turn t1+1, I am already at y=9, so I might do S or something, but since I have reached, I can do S.\n\nThe action at t1+1 doesn't change position if I do S, or if I do U, y=10, but y max 9, so if y=9, U or D might be invalid? No, the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y, with y in [0,9], so if at y=9, U would make y=10, but clamped to 9? Or is it allowed?\n\nThe update: y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=9 and U, y_{t+1} = min(9,10) =9? Or does it stay? The equation says y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y, but then \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\", so I think it is clamped.\n\nBut in the delta y, for U, +1, but if y_t=9, y_{t+1} =10, but since y in [0,9], it should be 9.\n\nSimilarly for D at y=0.\n\nSo effectively, if at y=9, U or S keeps it at 9, D moves to 8.\n\nBut in this case, at t1+1, I am at y=9, and I have to specify an action for that turn in the sequence? But for H=2, I need two actions.\n\nBut the position is reached at turn t1+1, after one action.\n\nThen for the second action, at t1+1, I can do anything, say S, and y stays 9.\n\nBut since I am already at y=9 at t1+1, and I need to be at y=9 at that turn, which I am.\n\nThe action at t1+1 is part of the sequence, but it doesn't affect the position since I'm already at target.\n\nBut to minimize H, H=2 is fine.\n\nPerhaps I can have H=1, but impossible.\n\nSo for this, with a_{11} = U, then at t=12, y=9.\n\nThen for the sequence, H=2, actions at t=11 and t=12.\n\nAt t=12, I can do S.\n\nThen output:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nBut is S necessary? Since I reach at t=12, and the action at t=12 is for the next position, but the position at turn t=12 is before action, I think.\n\nI need to be careful with the timing.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt the start of turn t, player is at (0, y_t)\n\nThen player chooses action a_t\n\nThen y_{t+1} is set based on a_t and y_t.\n\nThen at the end of turn t, or beginning of turn t+1, position is (0, y_{t+1})\n\nCollision is checked at turn t based on y_t and the cars at that turn.\n\nFor turn t, if y_t is between 1 and 8, and 0 in car span on that row at t, collision.\n\nIn this case, at t=11, y_11=8, row 8, car span at t=11: for freeway 8, car (96,49,right,48), so span at T=11: [49 +48(11-11), 96+48(0)] = [49,96], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction a_11 = U, then y_12 = 8 +1 =9.\n\nAt turn t=12, y_12=9, not a freeway, no collision.\n\ny_12=9, which is the target.\n\nFor the sequence, to have y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1=11, so t1 + H -1 =12 for H=2.\n\nActions: from t=0 to H-1, so t=0: a_{t1 +0} = a_11\n\nt=1: a_{t1 +1} = a_12\n\nFor a_11, we have U.\n\nFor a_12, since we are at y=9, we can choose S, so that y_13=9, but we don't care about later, we just need to be at y=9 at turn 12.\n\nThe action at t=12 is for determining y_13, but since we only care up to turn 12, we can choose any action, but to be safe, S is fine.\n\nPerhaps we can have only one action, but the sequence requires H actions for H turns? I think H is the number of actions, and the position is after H actions.\n\nBut the position at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAfter the actions from t1 to t1+H-1, the position at turn t1 + H -1 should be (0,9).\n\nTurn t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, after no actions, at turn t1, position is (0,8).\n\nAfter one action at t1, position at t1+1 is (0, y_{t1+1})\n\nTo have (0,9) at turn t1+1, so t1 + H -1 = t1+1, thus H-1=1, H=2.\n\nAnd the action at t1 makes y_{t1+1}=9.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, position is (0,9).\n\nThen for the sequence, we need two actions: at t1 and t1+1? t from 0 to H-1, so for H=2, t=0 and t=1: a_{t1} and a_{t1+1}.\n\nAt a_{t1}, we set to U to reach y=9 at t1+1.\n\nAt a_{t1+1}, we can set to S, so that y_{t1+2} =9, but it's not necessary, but we have to specify it.\n\nSince the position at t1+1 is already 9, and we reached, the action at t1+1 can be arbitrary, but we include it in the sequence.\n\nTo minimize H, H=2 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps for some positions, it might take more, but here it seems fine.\n\nBut why are there other cars? Maybe I need to consider if I have to wait or something, but in this case, no.\n\nPerhaps for row 8, at t=11, it's safe, but maybe at other times, but I'm only there at t=11.\n\nAnother thing: the car on row 8 is moving, but since it's moving away, no problem.\n\nBut let me check if for row 9, but no freeway.\n\nPerhaps the player can only move to adjacent rows, but here it's fine.\n\nBut I think I should verify the other cars in case I need to go through other rows, but I don't.\n\nPerhaps the initial position is on a freeway, but safe.\n\nBut let me see the car on row 6, for example, but not relevant.\n\nFreeway 6: (60,25,right,36) at t1=11.\n\nBut I'm not on row 6.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo I think moving up directly is possible.\n\nBut the target is (0,9), and I start at (0,8), so one move up.\n\nBut let me see if at t=11, on row 8, is there any car that could cause collision? No.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the turn when I move.\n\nAnother point: when I move from y=8 to y=9 at turn t, I am on y=8 at turn t, then move to y=9 at turn t+1.\n\nAt turn t, I am on y=8, collision checked based on cars on y=8 at turn t.\n\nAt turn t+1, on y=9, no cars.\n\nSo safe.\n\nPerhaps for y=9, it is not a freeway, so no cars, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0.\n\nIn this case, with a_11 = U, I reach y=9 at t=12.\n\nThen for the sequence, H=2, actions: a_11 = U, and a_12 = S (for example).\n\nBut in the answer format, I need to output for each turn.\n\nPerhaps I can set a_12 to U or D, but since y=9, U would keep it at 9, D to 8, but I don't want to go down, so S is fine.\n\nBut the action at t=12 is not necessary for reaching, but for the sequence, I have to include it.\n\nTo have minimal H, H=2 is fine.\n\nBut let me see if H=1 is possible, but no.\n\nPerhaps at t=11, I can be at y=9, but I start at 8.\n\nUnless I was already there, but no.\n\nSo H=2.\n\nBut let me double-check the car positions to be sure.\n\nAll cars are at high x values, moving right with high speed, so for all freeways, at t=11, min x is at least 7 for row 2, let's see.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: car (60,49,right,12) at t1, span [49,60], min=49>0\n\nFreeway 2: (18,7,right,6), span at T: [7 +6(T-11), 18+6(T-11)] at T=11, [7,18], min=7>0\n\nSimilarly freeway 3,4,5 same as 2? Freeway 2,3,4,5 all have (18,7,right,6)? Let's see:\n\nTable:\n\nFreeway 1: (60,49,right,12)\n\nFreeway 2: (18,7,right,6)\n\nFreeway 3: (18,7,right,6)\n\nFreeway 4: (18,7,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: (18,7,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: (60,25,right,36)  tail=25, head=60? (60,25,right,36), so tail=25, head=60, direction right, so at t1, span [25,60]? Min=25>0\n\nFreeway 7: (96,49,right,48) [49,96]\n\nFreeway 8: (96,49,right,48) [49,96]\n\nAll min x at t=11 are at least 7>0, so for any row, at t=11, no car has 0 in span, so all rows are safe at t=11.\n\nBut I'm only on row 8.\n\nMoreover, for future turns, since all cars are moving right, speed positive, min x increasing, so for T>11, min x even larger, so no car will have 0 in span for any row at any T>11.\n\nTherefore, all freeway rows are safe for all future times, because cars are moving away from x=0.\n\nTherefore, I can move freely without any collision risk.\n\nIn particular, from y=8, I can move up to y=9 immediately.\n\nSo with one action U at t=11, I reach y=9 at t=12.\n\nThen for H=2, actions: at t=11: U, at t=12: S (or U or D, but S to stay).\n\nBut in the sequence, I need to specify both.\n\nPerhaps I can have H=1, but impossible.\n\nAnother thing: the player must avoid collisions, but since no collision possible, fine.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and in this case H=2.\n\nBut let me confirm the output.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n}\n\nOr something.\n\nBut at turn 12, if I do S, y stays 9.\n\nIf I do nothing, but I have to specify action.\n\nPerhaps I can set a_12 to U, but y=10 not possible, so y stays 9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nS is fine.\n\nBut to be precise, since the position is reached at turn 12, and action at turn 12 doesn't affect that, but for the sequence, I include it.\n\nPerhaps H can be defined differently, but I think this is standard.\n\nAnother way: perhaps the minimal H such that after H-1 actions, I am at y=9 at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nWith 0 actions, at t1, y=8.\n\nWith 1 action, at t1+1, y=9 possible.\n\nSo H=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for this case, it should be simple.\n\nBut why are there multiple cars with same values? For example, freeways 2,3,4,5 all have same car? But different rows, so each row has its own car.\n\nBut in this case, not relevant.\n\nSo I think I'm overcomplicating.\n\nThus, minimal H=2, actions: a_11 = U, a_12 = S.\n\nBut in the sequence, only a_11 is needed to reach, but I have to include a_12.\n\nPerhaps for a_12, since I am at y=9, I can do any, but S is safe.\n\nTo make it consistent, I'll put S.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nWith H=2.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). Moving up increases \\(y\\) by 1, moving down decreases \\(y\\) by 1, and staying keeps \\(y\\) the same, with \\(y\\) clamped between 0 and 9.\n- The target position (0, 9) is not on a freeway (freeways are only \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)), so once reached, no collision is possible.\n- At turn \\(t = 11\\), the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The car on freeway 8 has span at \\(T = 11\\): \\([49 + 48(11-11), 96 + 48(11-11)] = [49, 96]\\). Since 0 is not in \\([49, 96]\\), no collision occurs.\n- Moving up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t = 12\\) is safe because \\(y = 9\\) has no cars.\n- All cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are moving right with positive speeds, so their minimum \\(x\\) positions increase over time. At \\(T = 11\\), the minimum \\(x\\) for any car is 7 (on freeways 2-5), which is greater than 0, and for \\(T > 11\\), the minimum \\(x\\) increases further. Thus, 0 is never in any car's span for \\(T \\geq 11\\) on any freeway, meaning all rows are safe at all future times.\n- Therefore, moving directly up from \\(y = 8\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is safe and minimal.\n\n### Minimal Sequence:\n- To reach (0, 9) at turn \\(t = 12\\) (which is \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 11 + 2 - 1 = 12\\)), set \\(H = 2\\).\n- Action at turn 11: U (moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12).\n- Action at turn 12: S (stays at \\(y = 9\\), but any action is acceptable since the target is already reached).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 2\\) turns, which is minimal because \\(H = 1\\) would require being at (0, 9) at turn 11, but the initial position is (0, 8).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: S\n}",
