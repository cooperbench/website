        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 0, and the snake is at position (3,3) with head direction left (L). The walls are defined: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4). Food items are at (6,3) with value 1 and life span 10, (5,5) with value 1 and life span 10, and (6,6) with value 1 and life span 10. All food is positive since value is +1.\n\nThe snake has only one segment, which is the head, so positions are [(3,3)]. That means the snake is just the head, no body yet. So, when it eats food, it will grow.\n\nSince the snake has no body, moving shouldn't cause self-collision except for the tail reward danger, but with no tail, that might not apply yet.\n\nHead direction is left, so from (3,3), moving left would be to (2,3). But I need to check for walls or obstacles.\n\nList all walls and obstacles:\n\n- Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So any move to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 is invalid.\n\n- Internal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4)\n\n(1,3) is an obstacle, and (2,4), etc.\n\nCurrent position: (3,3)\n\nPossible moves: Since head direction is L, I can move U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Current direction is L, so I cannot move R (right) immediately because that would be opposite. No instant reverse means I can't move in the opposite direction on the next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move right on this turn.\n\nAllowed moves: U, D, L. R is not allowed because it's reverse.\n\nConfirm: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So for turn t1, since direction is L, I cannot choose R for this move.\n\nSo possible actions: Up, Down, Left.\n\nNow, check each possible move for safety and accessibility.\n\nFirst, move Left (L): to (2,3)\n\nIs (2,3) a wall or obstacle? Borders: x=0 and x=7, y=0 and y=7. (2,3) has x=2, y=3, not on border. Internal obstacles: (1,3) is an obstacle, but (2,3) is not listed. Obstacles are (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4). (2,3) is not there, so it should be free.\n\nBut (1,3) is obstacle, but (2,3) is different cell. So (2,3) should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, move Up (U): to (3,4)\n\n(3,4): is it obstacle? Internal obstacles include (3,4), yes! (3,4) is listed, so it's an obstacle. Cannot move there.\n\nMove Down (D): to (3,2)\n\n(3,2): borders? x=3 not 0 or 7, y=2 not 0 or 7, so not border. Internal obstacles: none at (3,2), so should be free.\n\nList of obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4). No (3,2), so free.\n\nMove Right (R): but I cannot move right because it's opposite to current direction L.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (2,3), D to (3,2). U to (3,4) is blocked by obstacle.\n\nU is to (3,4), which is obstacle, so invalid.\n\nSo only L and D are possible immediate moves.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead, as per instruction.\n\nAlso, food positions: (6,3), (5,5), (6,6)\n\n(6,3) is to the right, same y=3, x=6.\n\n(5,5) x=5,y=5, (6,6) x=6,y=6.\n\nCurrent position (3,3).\n\nSince snake has no body, eating food will add a segment. After eating, the length becomes 2, with head and tail.\n\nFood life span: all have life span 10, so they disappear after 10 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn 0, life span 10, it will disappear after turn 10, meaning it exists for 10 more turns? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it exists at turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and gone at turn t+L.\n\nFor example, at turn 0, life span 10, it exists from turn 0 to turn 9, gone at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, countdown: at turn 0, countdown is 10, meaning 10 turns left including current, so after this turn, at turn 1, countdown 9, etc.\n\nBut for planning, I need to consider how long food is available.\n\nNow, since I need to maximize score, I should aim to eat positive food. All food here is positive, value +1.\n\nBut I need to avoid risks, especially tail reward danger.\n\nCurrently, no tail, so no immediate danger from that.\n\nPossible moves: L to (2,3) or D to (3,2)\n\nNow, think ahead.\n\nFirst, if I move L to (2,3):\n\nPosition becomes head at (2,3), and since no body, tail is also at (2,3) but after move, since no growth, snake is still one segment at (2,3)? When snake moves without eating, the tail moves, but since only head, moving to (2,3) means snake is now at [(2,3)].\n\nThen head direction is now L, since I moved left.\n\nThen next turn, possible moves from (2,3).\n\nCurrent direction L, so cannot move R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3)\n\nNow, (2,4): is it obstacle? Internal obstacles include (2,4), yes! (2,4) is listed, so obstacle. Cannot move U.\n\nD to (2,2): not border, not obstacle, should be free.\n\nL to (1,3): (1,3) is obstacle, listed, so cannot move.\n\nSo from (2,3), only possible move is D to (2,2), since U and L blocked, R is reverse if direction is L.\n\nAfter moving L to (2,3), head direction is L, so from (2,3), cannot move R (east).\n\nMoves: U to (2,4) — obstacle, blocked.\n\nD to (2,2) — free, I think.\n\nL to (1,3) — obstacle, blocked.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (2,2).\n\nThen snake moves to (2,2), direction down.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: U, D, L, R, but current direction D, so cannot move U (up, opposite).\n\nSo can move D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2)\n\nNow, (2,1): y=1, not border (borders y=0,y=7), so y=1 is ok, x=2 ok, not obstacle.\n\n(1,2): x=1,y=2, not border, obstacles? (1,3) is obstacle but (1,2) not listed, so should be free.\n\n(3,2): same as before, free.\n\nBut I need to think about food.\n\nFood is at (6,3), (5,5), (6,6)\n\nFrom (2,2), I can go to (3,2) or (1,2) or (2,1), but (6,3) is at x=6,y=3, which is east and same y.\n\nBut I'm at (2,2), so need to go east and north a bit.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is northeast, (6,6) further northeast.\n\nNow, if I move D first to (3,2) at turn 0.\n\nFrom (3,2), head direction down? After moving D to (3,2), direction is D.\n\nThen possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot move U (opposite to D).\n\nSo can move D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2)\n\n(3,1): y=1, not border, not obstacle.\n\n(2,2): free.\n\n(4,2): x=4,y=2, not border, obstacles? No (4,2) in list, so free.\n\nNow, to reach food, for example (6,3), I need to go east.\n\nBut let's see the grid size.\n\nBorders x=0 to x=7, y=0 to y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid? x from 0 to 7 inclusive is 8 cells, similarly y.\n\nBut walls at x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No.\n\n\"Cells occupied by walls: Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So the grid has walls on the borders, so playable cells are from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6? x from 1 to 6 inclusive is 6 cells, similarly y.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1,2,3,4,5,6 are playable, that's 6 columns.\n\nSimilarly y=1 to 6, 6 rows.\n\ny=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4)\n\nSo let's list all blocked cells:\n\n- All border cells: x=0, x=7 for all y; y=0, y=7 for all x. But since playable area is interior, we care about cells with 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6 except obstacles.\n\nObstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4)\n\nAlso, food at (6,3), (5,5), (6,6)\n\n(6,6) is at x=6,y=6. Is y=6 a border? No, borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable. Similarly x=6 is playable.\n\nx=6 is not wall, since wall is x=7, so x=6 is ok.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 ok.\n\nNow back to moves.\n\nAt turn 0, from (3,3), I can go L to (2,3) or D to (3,2)\n\nIf I go L to (2,3), then only next move is D to (2,2), as we saw.\n\nThen from (2,2), I can go to (3,2), (1,2), or (2,1)\n\nIf I go to (3,2), that's where I could have gone directly from start by moving D.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,2) I can go to (1,2), etc.\n\nBut let's think about getting to food.\n\nFood at (6,3) is closest in terms of Manhattan distance? From (3,3) to (6,3) is |3-6| + |3-3| = 3 steps right, but I cannot move right directly because direction is L.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (6,3): I need to go east, but I can't now.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is |3-5| + |3-5| = 2+2=4 steps, (6,6) is 3+3=6 steps.\n\nAll food has life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nBut I need to plan a path that avoids dead ends.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nBlocked cells: (1,3), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (3,4)\n\n(1,6) is blocked, (1,4) blocked, (1,3) blocked, (2,4) blocked, (3,4) blocked.\n\nAlso, borders not playable, but we don't go there.\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,1), (1,2), (1,5) — (1,5) not listed blocked, so free.\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,5) should be free, since only (1,3),(1,4),(1,6) blocked for x=1.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,5), (2,6) — (2,4) blocked, so (2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(2,5),(2,6) free? (2,6) not listed blocked, obstacles are (1,6) but that's different cell.\n\n(1,6) blocked, (2,6) not mentioned, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,5), (3,6) — (3,4) blocked, so others free.\n\n(3,3) is current position.\n\n(4,1) to (4,6) all free, no obstacles listed.\n\n(5,1) to (5,6) free.\n\n(6,1) to (6,6) free, but food at (6,3),(6,6).\n\nFood at (6,3), (5,5), (6,6)\n\n(5,5) is also food.\n\nNow, from (3,3), if I move D to (3,2), then I can go to (3,1), (4,2), or (2,2) but (2,2) is west.\n\nIf I go to (4,2), then to (4,3), etc, towards east.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (2,3), then to (2,2), then I can go to (1,2) or (2,1) or (3,2).\n\nBut (1,2) is available, then from (1,2), I can go to (1,1) or (1,2) but current position, or to (2,2), etc.\n\nBut (1,3) is blocked, so from (1,2) I can go U to (1,3)? No, (1,3) is obstacle, blocked.\n\nFrom (1,2), moves: U to (1,3) — blocked, D to (1,1), L to (0,2) but x=0 is wall, invalid, R to (2,2).\n\nAlso, current direction: if I came from (2,2) to (1,2) moving L, then direction is L, so cannot move R.\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nAt turn 0: from (3,3), move L to (2,3), direction L.\n\nTurn 1: from (2,3), only possible move D to (2,2), direction D.\n\nTurn 2: from (2,2), direction D, so cannot move U. Possible moves: D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2)\n\nIf I move R to (3,2), then I'm at (3,2), which I could have reached directly by moving D at turn 0.\n\nBut let's say I move to (1,2) from (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2) move L to (1,2), direction L.\n\nThen at (1,2), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,3) — blocked, D to (1,1), L to (0,2) — x=0 wall, invalid, R to (2,2) but opposite direction? Current direction L, R is opposite, so cannot move R.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (1,1).\n\nMove D to (1,1), direction D.\n\nThen from (1,1), direction D, cannot move U. Moves: D to (1,0) — y=0 wall, invalid, L to (0,1) wall, R to (2,1), or S? Down is D, to (1,0) invalid.\n\nMoves: U (up), but cannot because opposite? Direction is D, so U is opposite, cannot. D to (1,0) invalid, L to (0,1) invalid, R to (2,1).\n\nOnly possible move R to (2,1).\n\nThen to (2,1), and so on.\n\nThis path seems to go to the corner and might be risky if snake grows.\n\nBut currently no food eaten, so no growth.\n\nSimilarly, if from (2,2) I move D to (2,1), then to (2,1), direction D, then can go to (2,0) invalid, or (1,1), (3,1), etc.\n\nBut let's consider the other choice.\n\nAt turn 0, move D to (3,2).\n\nThen at (3,2), direction D.\n\nTurn 1: from (3,2), cannot move U (opposite). Moves: D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2)\n\nAll possible.\n\nIf I move R to (4,2), then to (4,2), direction R.\n\nThen I can go to (4,3), (4,1), (5,2), etc.\n\n(4,3) is free, and then to (5,3), (6,3) which has food.\n\nFrom (4,2) to (4,3) is up, or to (5,2) right, etc.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach (6,3) in a few moves.\n\nFrom (3,2) move R to (4,2) at turn 1.\n\nThen turn 2: at (4,2), direction R, so cannot move L. Moves: U to (4,3), D to (4,1), R to (5,2)\n\n(4,3) is free, (4,1) free, (5,2) free.\n\nIf I move U to (4,3), then at (4,3), direction U.\n\nThen from there, I can move U to (4,4), but (4,4) is free? No obstacles, so yes.\n\nBut food at (6,3) is at y=3, x=6, so from (4,3), I can move R to (5,3), then to (6,3).\n\n(5,3) is free? (5,3) not obstacle, yes.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) has food.\n\nNow, life span 10, at turn 0, so if I go directly, from turn 0: move D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,2)\n\nTurn 2: move U to (4,3) — but (4,3) is at same y as start, but x=4.\n\nThen turn 3: from (4,3) move R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 4: move R to (6,3) and eat food.\n\nBut at turn 4, I reach (6,3) and eat.\n\nLife span: at turn 0, food has life span 10, so it will be there until turn 9, so turn 4 is fine.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows to length 2, with head at (6,3) and tail at (5,3)? When you eat, the tail doesn't move, so after moving to food, head is at food, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, but since it was only head, before eating, snake is at [(5,3)] when I move to (6,3), so after eating, snake becomes [(6,3), (5,3)] with head at (6,3), tail at (5,3).\n\nThen I need to move from there.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, I need to decide turn 0 action.\n\nAnother option: from (3,2) at turn 0, I could move D to (3,1), but that might not be towards food.\n\nOr L to (2,2), which is west.\n\nBut moving towards (6,3) seems good.\n\nWhat about other food? (5,5) and (6,6), which are north-east.\n\nFrom (3,3), if I could go up, but (3,4) is blocked, so I cannot go up directly.\n\nThe only ways are down or left, but left leads to a constrained area.\n\nFor example, if I go left to (2,3), then down to (2,2), then I have to go to (2,1) or (1,2) or (3,2).\n\nIf I go to (3,2), same as before.\n\nBut from (2,2) to (3,2) is east, which is good.\n\nBut if I go to (1,2), I get stuck in the west side.\n\nMoreover, there is food at (6,6), but it might be farther.\n\nBut with life span 10, I can reach it later.\n\nAlso, I need to think about tail reward danger, but for now, snake is short.\n\nPerhaps I should aim for the closest food.\n\n(6,3) is at distance 3 in x, same y, but I need to go via (3,2) or something.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (6,3) is 3 steps right, but I can't go right now.\n\nMinimum path: for example, down to (3,2), then right to (4,2), up to (4,3), right to (5,3), right to (6,3), 4 moves.\n\nFrom (3,3) go left to (2,3), down to (2,2), right to (3,2), then same as above, but that takes more moves: turn 0 L to (2,3), turn 1 D to (2,2), turn 2 R to (3,2), turn 3 R to (4,2)? From (3,2) direction? After moving R to (3,2) from (2,2), at turn 2, position (3,2), direction R? From (2,2) to (3,2) is east, so direction R.\n\nThen turn 3: from (3,2) direction R, cannot move L, can move U, D, R.\n\nBut U to (3,3) is where I came from, but no body yet, so possible, but not towards food.\n\nCan move R to (4,2), then same as before.\n\nBut it takes an extra turn: to reach (4,2) at turn 3 instead of turn 1.\n\nWith first path: turn 0 D to (3,2), turn 1 R to (4,2), turn 2 U to (4,3), turn 3 R to (5,3), turn 4 R to (6,3) eat.\n\n5 turns to eat, including turn 0 action.\n\nTurn 0: move D to (3,2) — that's the first action, after which position is (3,2) at start of turn 1? Let's clarify turns.\n\nTurn t1=0: I take action, move to new cell.\n\nAfter move, at the end of turn, if I eat food, I grow.\n\nBut for position, after action.\n\nAt turn 0, before move, head at (3,3), direction L.\n\nAfter move, say to (3,2), then at turn 1, head at (3,2), direction D.\n\nThen move to (4,2), end of turn 1, head at (4,2), etc.\n\nIn terms of reaching (6,3):\n\n- Path via down: turn 0: move D to (3,2) — now at (3,2)\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,2) — at (4,2)\n\nTurn 2: move U to (4,3) — at (4,3)\n\nTurn 3: move R to (5,3) — at (5,3)\n\nTurn 4: move R to (6,3) — eat food, grow to length 2.\n\nAfter turn 4, snake is [(6,3), (5,3)]\n\nNow, food at (5,5) and (6,6) still available.\n\nLife span: at turn 0, life span 10, so food exists until turn 9.\n\nTurn 4 is early, so I can eat it.\n\nIf I go left first, it takes longer to reach food.\n\nFor example, turn 0 L to (2,3), turn 1 D to (2,2), turn 2 R to (3,2), turn 3 R to (4,2), turn 4 U to (4,3), turn 5 R to (5,3), turn 6 R to (6,3) eat. So turn 6, still within life span, but later than turn 4.\n\nSo better to go down first for efficiency.\n\nMoreover, going left might lead to dead end.\n\nFor example, if I go to (2,2), and then to (1,2), to (1,1), to (2,1), etc, it wastes time and might be risky with longer snake.\n\nBut since no food eaten, no risk yet.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat soon to grow and eat more.\n\nAlso, there are multiple food, so I can plan to eat all.\n\nBut let's see the grid with obstacles.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger.\n\nAfter eating at (6,3), snake is at [(6,3), (5,3)], head at (6,3), tail at (5,3).\n\nNow, from (6,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut direction: last move was R to (6,3), so direction R.\n\nCannot move L (opposite).\n\nAlso, walls: x=6, but x=6 is not wall, wall is x=7, so x=6 is playable.\n\ny=3, not border.\n\nMoves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2), R to (7,3) but x=7 wall, invalid. So cannot move R.\n\nL to (5,3) but (5,3) is tail.\n\nNow, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nHere, (5,3) is tail, and it has no food, food was at (6,3) which I just ate.\n\nAfter eating, the tail is at (5,3), no food there.\n\nNow, if I move L to (5,3), that would be moving into the tail.\n\nBut \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo if I move to (5,3), the tail will move away, so no collision.\n\nBut let's see: if I move L to (5,3), head moves to (5,3), which is current tail position. Then since I didn't eat food (no food at (5,3)), the tail moves to... the body: snake was [(6,3), (5,3)], head moves to (5,3), so positions: head new at (5,3), body segment at (6,3) becomes tail? When head moves to a new cell, the body follows.\n\nStandard snake: head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo if head moves to (5,3), then the segment that was at (6,3) moves to where head was? No.\n\nPositions: before move, segments: index 0: head (6,3), index 1: tail (5,3)\n\nAfter moving head to (5,3), the head is now at (5,3), and the body segment (which was at (6,3)) moves to the previous position of the head? No, in snake movement, when head moves to a new cell, the tail moves off its position only if no growth.\n\nSince no food eaten, tail moves away.\n\nSo after moving to (5,3), the new head is at (5,3), and the segment that was at (6,3) is now the tail, at (6,3)? Let's think.\n\nInitial: positions list: [(6,3), (5,3)] head at (6,3), tail at (5,3)\n\nHead moves to (5,3) — which is the current tail position.\n\nThen, since head moves to (5,3), the body segment (5,3) is no longer there, it becomes the new head position? The positions update: the head is now at (5,3), and the segment that was at (6,3) moves to the position that was previously occupied by the head, but head was at (6,3), so it moves to (6,3)? I'm confusing.\n\nStandard: the tail segment is removed, and new head position added.\n\nSo if head moves from (6,3) to (5,3), and (5,3) was tail, so we add new head at (5,3), and remove the tail at (5,3), but that cell is now head, so the snake becomes [(5,3), (6,3)]? Positions: after move, head is at (5,3), and the body segment is at (6,3), so snake is [(5,3), (6,3)] with head at (5,3), tail at (6,3).\n\nYes.\n\nSo moving to tail is safe, as long as no food or other issue.\n\nIn this case, no problem.\n\nBut from (6,3), I can move U to (6,4), D to (6,2), or L to (5,3).\n\nR to (7,3) invalid.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nAt turn 0, moving D to (3,2) seems better to reach food faster.\n\nBut let's check if there is food that might expire or something, but all have same life span.\n\n(6,6) might be eaten later.\n\nAlso, after eating (6,3), I can go to (5,5) or (6,6).\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), (6,6) at (6,6).\n\nFrom (6,3) after eating, head at (6,3), I can move U to (6,4), then to (6,5), then to (5,5) or (6,6).\n\n(6,5) to (5,5) is left, or to (6,6) up.\n\nBut (5,5) has food.\n\nSimilarly, I could go to (6,6) first.\n\nBut let's not optimize too much now.\n\nAnother thing: in the move sequence, when I go to (4,3) from (4,2) by moving up, but (4,3) is free.\n\nIn the path to (6,3), I have turn 2 move U to (4,3) from (4,2).\n\n(4,3) is not food, so no issue.\n\nThen to (5,3), not food, to (6,3) eat.\n\n(5,3) is not food, food is at (5,5) and (6,6), not at (5,3).\n\nSo ok.\n\nNow, what about the other move option at start: moving left.\n\nIf I move left to (2,3), then I must go down to (2,2), then I can go to (3,2) or (1,2) or (2,1).\n\nIf I go to (3,2), I can continue to food, but slower.\n\nIf I go to (1,2), then to (1,1), etc, which might be a dead end if snake is long.\n\nFor example, from (1,1), I can only go to (2,1) or (1,2) but depending on direction.\n\nBut since grid has obstacles, the area around (1,1) might be limited.\n\nFor instance, from (1,1): can go to (1,2) but (1,3) blocked, so cannot go up far, or to (2,1), or down to (1,0) invalid.\n\nSo only (2,1) or (1,2), but (1,2) is only down or right, etc.\n\nIt could be risky to get stuck.\n\nWhereas going down to (3,2) opens up the right side.\n\nMoreover, there is food at (5,5) and (6,6), which are easier to reach from east.\n\n(6,6) is at corner, might be tricky.\n\nBut for now, at turn 0, moving D to (3,2) seems best.\n\nBut let's confirm the action.\n\nCurrent direction L, moving D is down, which is allowed, not reverse.\n\nThen for multiple turns, I need to plan 5+ turns ahead.\n\nThe answer should be a sequence of actions for several turns.\n\nThe format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nt1=0, so turn 0, turn 1, turn 2, ...\n\nBut I need to specify for how many turns? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and output a sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, it shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I should provide a sequence for a few turns, at least 5.\n\nSince I plan to eat at turn 4, I can go up to that.\n\nBut after that, I need to continue.\n\nPerhaps provide until I eat the first food.\n\nBut the instruction says \"prioritize long-term survival\", so I need to think beyond.\n\nAfter eating at (6,3), I have to move away.\n\nFrom (6,3), after eating, snake is [(6,3), (5,3)], head at (6,3).\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2), L to (5,3) but (5,3) is tail, but moving there is safe as we said.\n\nBut to avoid potential issues, better to move U or D.\n\nFor example, move U to (6,4).\n\nThen at (6,4), head direction U.\n\nThen I can go to (6,5), then to (5,5) or (6,6).\n\n(5,5) is food at (5,5), which is left and up? (6,5) to (5,5) is left, same y? (6,5) to (5,5) is west, y decrease? (5,5) x=5,y=5, (6,5) x=6,y=5, so from (6,5) to (5,5) is left, y same.\n\nSimilarly, to (6,6) is up.\n\nNow, both have food.\n\n(5,5) life span 10, at turn 4, it has been 4 turns, so countdown 10-4=6? Life span decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn 0, life span 10, so at turn t, remaining life = 10 - t, disappears when remaining=0.\n\nAt turn t, if life span was L at turn 0, remaining at turn t is L - t, and it exists as long as remaining >0, disappears when remaining=0.\n\nAt turn 0, remaining=10, exists.\n\nAfter turn 0, at turn 1, remaining=9, and so on, until turn 10, remaining=0, disappears.\n\nSo at turn 4, for food at (5,5), remaining life = 10 - 4 = 6 turns left.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, from (6,4), I can move U to (6,5), then from there to (5,5) or (6,6).\n\n(5,5) is one move left from (6,5), (6,6) is one move up.\n\nBut I need to choose.\n\nAlso, tail is at (5,3) or wherever.\n\nAfter moving to (6,4) from (6,3), snake was [(6,3), (5,3)], head to (6,4), so new head (6,4), body at (6,3), tail at (5,3)? Positions: head moved to (6,4), so new positions: head (6,4), then the segment that was head is now body at (6,3), and tail at (5,3) remains? No.\n\nMovement: head moves to (6,4), so new head position (6,4). The previous head (6,3) becomes the body segment. The tail (5,3) is removed because no growth. So snake becomes [(6,4), (6,3)].\n\nHead at (6,4), tail at (6,3).\n\nThen from (6,4), move U to (6,5), then snake [(6,5), (6,4)]\n\nThen from (6,5), I can move L to (5,5) to eat food there.\n\n(5,5) has food, so eating it, grow to length 3: head at (5,5), body at (6,5), tail at (6,4)? After moving to (5,5), head at (5,5), body: previous head (6,5) becomes body, and since ate, add new segment? When eat, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nAfter moving to food, the head is at food, and a new segment is added at the tail position, but tail position is where it was before move.\n\nBefore move to (5,5), snake is at [(6,5), (6,4)]\n\nHead at (6,5), tail at (6,4)\n\nMove head to (5,5), which has food, so eat, grow: head at (5,5), the body segment is at (6,5), and a new segment is added at the previous tail position (6,4), so snake becomes [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4)]\n\nHead (5,5), tail (6,4)\n\nThen I can continue to (6,6) or other.\n\nBut (6,6) has food, from (5,5) I can move R to (6,5) but (6,5) is body, collision, or U to (5,6), etc.\n\n(5,6) is free? y=6, not border, obstacles? (1,6) blocked but not (5,6), so free.\n\nThen from (5,6) to (6,6) to eat.\n\nBut let's not plan too far.\n\nBack to turn 0.\n\nI think moving down is better.\n\nBut there is another food at (5,5), which I might reach faster? From (3,3) to (5,5) is |3-5| + |3-5| = 4, but with obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (3,3) I cannot go up because (3,4) blocked.\n\nSo I need to go around.\n\nFor instance, down to (3,2), then right to (4,2), then up to (4,3), then right to (5,3), then up to (5,4), then up to (5,5), but (5,4) free? Yes, so 5 moves: D,R,U,R,U to (5,5).\n\nCompared to going to (6,3) in 4 moves: D,R,U,R.\n\nTo (6,3): positions: start (3,3), D to (3,2), R to (4,2), U to (4,3), R to (5,3), R to (6,3) — that's 5 actions to eat at turn 5? Turn 0: to (3,2), turn 1: to (4,2), turn 2: to (4,3), turn 3: to (5,3), turn 4: to (6,3) eat. So after 4 actions, eat at turn 4.\n\nSimilarly to (5,5): from (3,3) D to (3,2), R to (4,2), U to (4,3), R to (5,3), U to (5,4), U to (5,5) eat at turn 5? Turn 0: D to (3,2), turn 1: R to (4,2), turn 2: U to (4,3), turn 3: R to (5,3), turn 4: U to (5,4), turn 5: U to (5,5) eat. So turn 5.\n\nWhereas (6,3) at turn 4.\n\n(6,6) is farther.\n\nSo (6,3) is closer in terms of moves.\n\nAlso, after eating (6,3), (5,5) is still available.\n\n(5,5) at turn 4 has remaining life 10-4=6, so I can go there.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) remaining 6.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I should start with moving down.\n\nBut let's output the actions.\n\nFirst, turn 0: move D to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 1: from (3,2) direction D, cannot move U. I should move R to (4,2) to go towards food.\n\nThen turn 2: from (4,2) direction R (since moved right), cannot move L. Moves: U to (4,3), D to (4,1), R to (5,2)\n\nI move U to (4,3) to go towards y=3.\n\nThen turn 3: from (4,3) direction U (since moved up), cannot move D. Moves: U to (4,4), D to (4,2) but opposite? Direction U, D is opposite, cannot. L to (3,3), R to (5,3)\n\nMove R to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 4: from (5,3) direction R, cannot move L. Moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2), R to (6,3)\n\nMove R to (6,3) and eat food.\n\nNow, after that, at turn 4, snake is [(6,3), (5,3)] head at (6,3) direction R.\n\nNow turn 5: from (6,3), cannot move L (opposite) or R (wall). Possible: U to (6,4) or D to (6,2)\n\nI should go towards other food, say (5,5), so up to (6,4)\n\nMove U to (6,4)\n\nThen snake: head to (6,4), body at (6,3), tail removed? Snake was [(6,3), (5,3)], head to (6,4), so new: head (6,4), body (6,3), tail (5,3) removed? No, positions: head moves to (6,4), previous head (6,3) becomes body, tail (5,3) is removed, so snake [(6,4), (6,3)]\n\nHead at (6,4) direction U.\n\nTurn 6: from (6,4) move U to (6,5)\n\nSnake: head to (6,5), body at (6,4), tail removed? [(6,5), (6,4)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 7: from (6,5) move L to (5,5) to eat food.\n\n(5,5) has food, so eat, grow: head to (5,5), body at (6,5), and new segment at previous tail position (6,4)? After move, snake was [(6,5), (6,4)], head to (5,5), so new head (5,5), body: previous head (6,5) becomes body, and since ate, add new segment at tail position (6,4), so snake [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4)]\n\nHead at (5,5) direction L (since moved left).\n\nNow, from here, I can go to (6,6) or other.\n\n(6,6) is adjacent, at (6,6).\n\nFrom (5,5) I can move R to (6,5) but (6,5) is body, collision, cannot.\n\nMove U to (5,6), then to (6,6).\n\nMove U to (5,6)\n\nThen from (5,6) move R to (6,6) eat.\n\nBut let's see the sequence so far.\n\nFor the answer, I need to provide actions from turn 0 onwards.\n\nSince thinking 5+ turns, I can provide until turn 5 or so.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 7 I eat second food, but turn 7 might be beyond.\n\nPerhaps provide actions for turn 0 to turn 4 or 5.\n\nBut the state is at turn 0, and I need to output for multiple turns.\n\nNow, to confirm, is there any risk in this path?\n\nFor example, when moving to (4,3), is it safe? Yes, no body.\n\nAfter eating at (6,3), moving up.\n\nBut when I move to (6,5), and then to (5,5), the tail was at (6,4), and I move to (5,5), which is not adjacent to tail, so no tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger only if head adjacent to tail and tail has food.\n\nHere tail at (6,4), no food.\n\nSo ok.\n\nNow, for the sequence:\n\nTurn 0: move D (down)\n\nTurn 1: move R (right)\n\nTurn 2: move U (up)\n\nTurn 3: move R (right)\n\nTurn 4: move R (right) to eat at (6,3)\n\nNow, after that, turn 5: move U (up) to (6,4)\n\nTurn 6: move U (up) to (6,5)\n\nTurn 7: move L (left) to (5,5) eat\n\nBut turn 7 might be too far, and I need to specify only actions.\n\nSince the answer format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" I can provide for as many as I want, but at least 5 turns.\n\nt1=0, so turns 0,1,2,3,4,5...\n\nIn my sequence, turn 5 is moving U from (6,3), which is after eating.\n\nTo think 5 turns ahead from turn 0, that would be up to turn 5.\n\nAt turn 5, I am at (6,4) or something.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have actions defined.\n\nPerhaps output for 5 actions: turn 0 to turn 4.\n\nAt turn 4, I eat, so that might be good.\n\nThen I can stop or continue.\n\nThe instruction doesn't specify how many turns to output, but \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and output a sequence.\n\nIn the format, it shows multiple turns.\n\nI think providing until the first eat is fine, but let's see.\n\nAnother thing: all food is positive, but there might be negative food later, but here not.\n\nAlso, food under body: currently no body, so no issue.\n\nSo for now, I'll go with moving down at turn 0.\n\nBut earlier I thought about moving left, but it seems inferior.\n\nTo be thorough, suppose I move left at turn 0 to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 1: move D to (2,2) (only choice)\n\nThen turn 2: from (2,2) direction D, cannot move U. Possible moves: D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2)\n\nIf I move R to (3,2), then same as before but later.\n\nThen turn 3: from (3,2) move R to (4,2), etc., reaching food later.\n\nWorse.\n\nIf I move to (1,2), then must go to (1,1), then to (2,1), etc., wasting time.\n\nSo not good.\n\nTherefore, best to move down at turn 0.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 0: D\n\nTurn 1: R\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: R (to eat)\n\nAnd since thinking ahead, I can add more, but for now, up to turn 4.\n\nTo show survival, I can add turn 5: U\n\nBut in turn 5, from (6,3) after eating, move U to (6,4)\n\nBut at turn 4, after move R to (6,3), I eat, so at turn 5, position (6,3) head, but after move.\n\nPerhaps list actions per turn.\n\nIn the sequence, each action is for that turn.\n\nSo for turn 0: D\n\nTurn 1: R\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nThen turn 5: U (to go towards other food)\n\nBut turn 5 is not necessary, but to show I think ahead.\n\nSince the state has multiple food, I should plan to eat them.\n\nBut for the answer, I think up to turn 4 is fine, as I eat at turn 4.\n\nNow, in the food, there is also (6,6), which I can eat later.\n\nBut no need to specify further actions.\n\nPerhaps output 5 turns: turn 0 to 4.\n\nTurn 4 is the eat turn.\n\nIn the action, at turn 4 I move to food.\n\nNow, about the head direction: after each move, direction changes.\n\nBut I don't need to output direction, only actions.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 2, I move U to (4,3), which is fine.\n\nIs there a shorter path? For example, from (4,2) at turn 1, instead of moving U, can I move R to (5,2), then U to (5,3), then R to (6,3)? From (5,2) to (5,3) is up.\n\nThen same number of moves: turn 0 D to (3,2), turn 1 R to (4,2)? No, from (3,2) move R to (4,2) turn 1.\n\nThen turn 2: instead of U, move R to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 3: move U to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 4: move R to (6,3)\n\nSame as before, but in this case, from (5,2) to (5,3), then to (6,3).\n\nIn previous, from (4,2) to (4,3) to (5,3) to (6,3).\n\nSlightly different, but same turns.\n\nNo issue.\n\nIn my first sequence, I have U then R, which is fine.\n\nNow, I think it's ok.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 0):**\n- Snake position: Head at (3,3), no body segments (length 1).\n- Head direction: Left (L).\n- Walls: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles at (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4).\n- Food: All positive (+1 value) with life span 10 (disappears after turn 10, so available until turn 9).\n  - (6,3): Requires moving east, but current direction limits immediate options.\n  - (5,5) and (6,6): Farther but reachable with planning.\n\n**Immediate Moves (Turn 0):**  \nCurrent direction is L, so reverse move (R) is invalid. Possible moves:  \n- **U (up) to (3,4)**: Blocked by obstacle (3,4). Invalid.  \n- **D (down) to (3,2)**: Valid, no wall or obstacle.  \n- **L (left) to (2,3)**: Valid, no wall or obstacle.  \n\n**Evaluation of Move Choices:**  \n- **Option: Move L to (2,3)**:  \n  - Turn 1: From (2,3), only valid move is D to (2,2) (U to (2,4) blocked, L to (1,3) blocked, R invalid due to direction).  \n  - Turn 2: From (2,2), direction D, can move to (2,1), (1,2), or (3,2). Moving to (1,2) leads to a dead end (only D to (1,1) then R to (2,1), wasting turns and risking future traps). Moving to (3,2) is better but delays reaching food.  \n  - Path to (6,3) takes at least 6 turns (e.g., L-D-R-R-U-R), missing opportunities for efficient scoring.  \n  - **Verdict**: Inefficient; leads to constrained area with higher long-term risk.  \n\n- **Option: Move D to (3,2)**:  \n  - Opens path to eastern food (6,3) and (5,5) efficiently.  \n  - Turn 1: From (3,2), direction D, can move R to (4,2) (optimal for food path).  \n  - Turn 2: From (4,2), direction R, can move U to (4,3) (toward food).  \n  - Turn 3: From (4,3), direction U, can move R to (5,3).  \n  - Turn 4: From (5,3), direction R, can move R to (6,3) to eat.  \n  - **Benefits**: Eats (6,3) by turn 4, maximizing early growth. Life span allows this (food available until turn 9). After eating, snake length 2, enabling safer navigation to other food.  \n  - **Risks**: None immediately; grid has open paths after.  \n\n**Long-Term Survival and Scoring Strategy:**  \n- **Prioritize (6,3)**: Closest food (reachable in 4 turns), allowing early growth to access other food safely.  \n- **Avoid Dead Ends**: Moving west (L) risks entrapment near obstacles; east/south paths are more open.  \n- **Post-Eating Plan**: After eating (6,3) at turn 4:  \n  - Head at (6,3), direction R. Move U to (6,4) on turn 5 to avoid tail (safe, no food on tail) and approach (5,5) or (6,6).  \n  - (5,5) can be eaten by turn 7 (e.g., U to (6,5), then L to (5,5)).  \n  - (6,6) can be eaten by turn 8–9.  \n- **Life Span Management**: All food expires after turn 10; eating (6,3) by turn 4 leaves ample time for others.  \n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Not applicable until snake length >1. After eating, ensure head not adjacent to tail when tail has food—monitor in later turns.  \n\n**5+ Turn Action Plan:**  \nSequence maximizes early food access while ensuring escape routes. Actions:  \n- **Turn 0**: Move D (down) to (3,2) — Best for efficiency and opening paths.  \n- **Turn 1**: Move R (right) to (4,2) — Continue toward (6,3); no immediate reverse issue.  \n- **Turn 2**: Move U (up) to (4,3) — Align y-coordinate with food; avoid obstacles.  \n- **Turn 3**: Move R (right) to (5,3) — Position for final move to food.  \n- **Turn 4**: Move R (right) to (6,3) — Eat food (+1, length increases to 2).  \n- **Turn 5**: Move U (up) to (6,4) — After eating, move away from tail toward (5,5) or (6,6); no collision risk.  \n\nThis sequence eats food in 4 turns, with turn 5 ensuring survival and setting up for more food. Beyond turn 5, continue toward (5,5) or (6,6) based on remaining life spans.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 1: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 2: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 3: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 4: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 5: U (up)\n}",
