        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, and I have to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at position 0 on that freeway at the same turn.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. All cars are moving right with various speeds. The car states are given for turn t=0.\n\nLet me list out the cars clearly:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head 48, tail 37, direction right, speed 12. Since it's moving right, the span is [τ, h] initially [37,48]. At time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [37 + 12T, 48 + 12T] because t1=0.\n\nt1=0, so for turn T, span = [τ + s*T, h + s*T] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 1: car: τ=37, h=48, s=12, right. So at turn T, span: [37 + 12T, 48 + 12T]\n\nCollision if I'm on freeway 1 at turn T and 0 is in [37+12T, 48+12T]. But since the car is long, 12 units, and moving fast, it might cover position 0 at some point.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: one car: τ=-48, h=-59? That can't be right. Head and tail: it says (-48, -59, right, 6). But if it's right-moving, head should be larger than tail? Let me read.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ < h I assume? But here for freeway 2, it says (-48, -59, right, 6). -48 and -59, -48 > -59, so if head is -48, tail is -59, that would mean head is at -48, tail at -59, so the car is from -59 to -48, which is length 11, moving right.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the description: \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ <= h? But in freeway 2, h=-48, τ=-59, so τ < h since -59 < -48.\n\n-59 is less than -48, so τ = -59, h = -48, so span [τ, h] = [-59, -48].\n\nThen at turn T, moving right speed 6, span [ -59 + 6T, -48 + 6T ]\n\nSimilarly for freeways 3,4,5,6: all have the same car: (-48, -59, right, 6)? No, let's see the table.\n\nFreeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6) — that's one car.\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 4: same\n\nFreeway 5: same\n\nFreeway 6: same\n\nThen freeway 7: three cars: (-48, -59, right, 6), (-12, -23, right, 6), (24, 13, right, 6)\n\n(24,13, right,6) — if head 24, tail 13, that's [13,24] moving right.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as 7: (-48,-59,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6)\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when a car covers position 0, i.e., when 0 is in the span for some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, I am on freeway y, and for some car on y, 0 ∈ span(T).\n\nBut note that I move at each turn: I choose action U, D, S, which changes y for the next turn.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy based on action.\n\nAnd I start at turn t1=0, position (0,0).\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe vertical axis is y=0 to 9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, I think y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so I don't need to worry about collisions at y=0 or y=9.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8\", and y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so I'm safe there.\n\nAt turn 0, I'm at (0,0), which is safe.\n\nI need to get to (0,9), which is also safe.\n\nBut to get there, I have to go through y=1 to 8, and avoid being there when a car is at 0.\n\nNow, since I move vertically, and cars move horizontally, the collision depends on the turn and the y-position.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when some car is covering position 0.\n\nThen I need to plan a path from y=0 to y=9 in min turns, such that when I am on a freeway y at turn T, it is not unsafe at that turn.\n\nI can only change y by -1, 0, or +1 each turn, so I have to step through the y-levels.\n\ny must be integer, from 0 to 9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns to go from 0 to 9 is 9 turns, if I go up every turn, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid unsafe times.\n\nSince I can stay or go down, I might take more turns, but I want minimal H, so I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=0 to t=H-1, so at turn H-1, I reach y=9.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nAfter one action, at t=1, y= y1 = y0 + Δy0, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn H, y_H =9.\n\nTurn indices: let t be the turn number.\n\nAt turn t, position is (0, y_t)\n\nAction a_t is chosen, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1})\n\nCollision at turn T if I am on a freeway y_T (so y_T between 1 and 8) and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in span(T) for that car.\n\nNow, for each freeway, find the set of turns T where it is unsafe, i.e., some car has 0 in its span at T.\n\nThen for my path, for each turn t, if y_t is between 1 and 8, then t must not be in the unsafe set for that y_t.\n\nIf y_t =0 or 9, no problem.\n\nI start at t=0, y=0, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nMin H such that after H actions, y_H =9.\n\ny_H is the position after H actions, at turn H.\n\nLet me define the state at the beginning of turn t.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think of the turn when I am at a position.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position (0, y_t), and I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}), and so on.\n\nCollision can occur at turn t if y_t is between 1 and 8 and freeway y_t has a car at 0 at turn t.\n\nNow, for each freeway k, find all t where there is a car with 0 in its span at turn t.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, [37 + 12t, 48 + 12t] since T=t, t1=0.\n\nSpan at turn t: [37 + 12t, 48 + 12t]\n\n0 ∈ [37+12t, 48+12t] when 37+12t <= 0 <= 48+12t\n\nSo 12t <= -37 and 12t >= -48? Let's solve inequalities.\n\n37 + 12t <= 0 and 0 <= 48 + 12t? No.\n\n0 is in [low, high] if low <= 0 <= high.\n\nSo low = 37 + 12t <= 0 and high = 48 + 12t >= 0.\n\nSo 37 + 12t <= 0 => 12t <= -37 => t <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, since t>=0, this is never true for t>=0.\n\nSimilarly, 48 + 12t >=0 is always true for t>=0.\n\nBut from above, 37 + 12t <=0 only for t <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, which is before t=0, so for t>=0, low =37+12t >=37>0, so 0 < low, so 0 not in [low, high] for any t>=0.\n\nThus freeway 1 is always safe? Let me confirm.\n\nAt t=0, span [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nAs t increases, span moves right, all positive, so 0 never covered. So yes, freeway 1 has no car at 0 for any t>=0. So it's always safe to be on freeway 1.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car, τ=-59, h=-48, s=6, right-moving.\n\nSpan at turn t: [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-59 + 6t, -48 + 6t]\n\n0 ∈ [-59+6t, -48+6t] if -59+6t <= 0 <= -48+6t\n\nSo -59+6t <= 0 => 6t <= 59 => t <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833\n\nAnd 0 <= -48+6t => 6t >=48 => t >= 8\n\nSo for t from 8 to 9 inclusive? t>=8 and t<=9.833, so t=8,9 since t integer.\n\nt=8: -59 + 48 = -11 <=0, -48+48=0 <=0? 0 <= -48+6t, at t=8, -48+48=0, so 0<=0 true.\n\nAt t=8, low = -59+48= -11 <=0, high= -48+48=0 <=0? 0 <= high, high=0, so 0<=0 true, so 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly t=9: -59+54= -5 <=0, -48+54=6 >=0, so 0 in [-5,6] yes.\n\nt=10: -59+60=1 >0, so low=1>0, 0 not in [1,6].\n\nSo unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same car, (-48,-59,right,6) same as freeway 2? No, freeway 3 has (-48,-59,right,6), which is identical to freeway 2 car.\n\nIn the table, freeway 3: (-48,-59,right,6), so same as freeway 2, so unsafe at t=8,9.\n\nFreeway 4: same, unsafe t=8,9.\n\nFreeway 5: same, unsafe t=8,9.\n\nFreeway 6: same, unsafe t=8,9.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6) same as above, span [-59+6t, -48+6t], unsafe when t=8,9.\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,6), τ=-23, h=-12? Head and tail: (-12,-23,right,6), so head=-12, tail=-23, so span [τ, h] = [-23, -12] for right-moving, at t, [-23 +6t, -12 +6t]\n\n0 ∈ [-23+6t, -12+6t] if -23+6t <=0 <= -12+6t\n\n-23+6t <=0 => 6t <=23 => t <= 23/6 ≈3.833\n\n0 <= -12+6t => 6t >=12 => t>=2\n\nSo t from 2 to 3 inclusive? t>=2 and t<=3.833, so t=2,3.\n\nt=2: -23+12= -11 <=0, -12+12=0 <=0? 0 <= -12+12=0, true.\n\nt=3: -23+18= -5 <=0, -12+18=6 >=0, yes.\n\nt=4: -23+24=1>0, not <=0, so no.\n\nSo unsafe at t=2,3 for this car.\n\nThird car on freeway 7: (24,13,right,6), head=24, tail=13, direction right, so span [τ, h] = [13,24] at t=0.\n\nAt turn t, [13+6t, 24+6t]\n\n0 ∈ [13+6t, 24+6t]? 13+6t >=13>0 for t>=0, so low>0, 0 never in. Always safe.\n\nSo for freeway 7, unsafe when either first car or second car has issue.\n\nFirst car unsafe t=8,9\n\nSecond car unsafe t=2,3\n\nThird car always safe.\n\nSo freeway 7 unsafe at t=2,3 (from second car) and t=8,9 (from first car).\n\nt=2,3 and t=8,9.\n\nNow freeway 8: same cars as freeway 7: (-48,-59,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6)\n\nSo identical to freeway 7, unsafe at t=2,3 and t=8,9.\n\nNow freeway 1: always safe, as we saw.\n\nFreeways 2,3,4,5,6: each has only one car, same as the first car on freeway 7, unsafe only at t=8,9.\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe t=8,9\n\nFreeway 3: same, t=8,9\n\n...\n\nFreeway 6: t=8,9\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe t=2,3 and t=8,9\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe t=2,3 and t=8,9\n\nAnd freeway 1 always safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\ny=0 at t=0, safe.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, no issue.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nEach freeway has unsafe times.\n\nI must not be on a freeway when it is unsafe for that turn.\n\nFor example, if I am on y=1 at turn t, it must not be unsafe, but y=1 is always safe, so no problem.\n\ny=2: unsafe at t=8,9\n\nSimilarly y=3,4,5,6: each unsafe at t=8,9 only? Freeway 2 is y=2? Freeway k corresponds to y=k.\n\nIn the table, freeway k, for k=1 to 8.\n\nSo freeway 1: y=1, always safe.\n\nFreeway 2: y=2, unsafe t=8,9\n\nFreeway 3: y=3, unsafe t=8,9\n\nFreeway 4: y=4, unsafe t=8,9\n\nFreeway 5: y=5, unsafe t=8,9\n\nFreeway 6: y=6, unsafe t=8,9\n\nFreeway 7: y=7, unsafe at t=2,3 and t=8,9\n\nFreeway 8: y=8, unsafe at t=2,3 and t=8,9\n\nI start at t=0, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: if I go up every turn, from y=0 at t=0, after 1 turn, t=1, y=1; t=2, y=2; ... up to t=9, y=9.\n\nBut I need to check if at any point I am on unsafe freeway at unsafe time.\n\nAt t=1, y=1: freeway 1, always safe, ok.\n\nt=2, y=2: freeway 2, unsafe at t=8,9, but t=2 is not 8 or 9, so safe? At t=2, y=2, is it unsafe? Freeway 2 unsafe only at t=8,9, so at t=2, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=3, y=3: freeway 3, unsafe only t=8,9, so t=3 safe.\n\nt=4, y=4: safe\n\nt=5, y=5: safe\n\nt=6, y=6: safe\n\nNow t=7, y=7: freeway 7, unsafe at t=2,3 and t=8,9. t=7 is not 2,3 or 8,9? t=7, so not unsafe, should be safe.\n\nt=8, y=8: freeway 8, unsafe at t=2,3 and t=8,9. t=8 is unsafe.\n\nAt t=8, if I am on y=8, it is unsafe because freeway 8 has unsafe at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, t=9, y=9, but y=9 is not a freeway, so safe, but at t=9, if I am at y=9, I have reached.\n\nIn the path: if I go up every turn:\n\nt=0: y=0, safe\n\na_t: action at t.\n\nAfter action at t, y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nStart: turn 0, position y=0.\n\nI choose action a_0, then at turn 1, I am at y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn H.\n\nMin H such that y_H =9.\n\nIf I go up every step: let a_t = U for t=0 to 8.\n\nThen:\n\nt=0: y=0\n\na0=U, then t=1, y=1\n\na1=U, t=2, y=2\n\na2=U, t=3, y=3\n\na3=U, t=4, y=4\n\na4=U, t=5, y=5\n\na5=U, t=6, y=6\n\na6=U, t=7, y=7\n\na7=U, t=8, y=8\n\na8=U, t=9, y=9\n\nNow, check for each turn when I am on freeway:\n\nAt turn t, y_t:\n\nt=0: y=0, safe\n\nt=1: y=1, freeway 1, always safe\n\nt=2: y=2, freeway 2, unsafe at t=8,9, t=2 not unsafe, safe\n\nt=3: y=3, freeway 3, unsafe t=8,9, safe\n\nt=4: y=4, freeway 4, unsafe t=8,9, safe\n\nt=5: y=5, freeway 5, unsafe t=8,9, safe\n\nt=6: y=6, freeway 6, unsafe t=8,9, safe\n\nt=7: y=7, freeway 7, unsafe at t=2,3 and t=8,9. t=7 not in {2,3,8,9}, so safe? t=7, yes.\n\nt=8: y=8, freeway 8, unsafe at t=2,3 and t=8,9. t=8 is unsafe, so if I am at y=8 at turn 8, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nThen at t=9: y=9, safe, but I reach at t=9.\n\nBut at t=8, I am on y=8, which is unsafe.\n\nSo collision at t=8.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=8 at t=8.\n\nIn this path, I am at y=8 at t=8, which is bad.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, I would be at y=9, but t=8 is the issue.\n\nNow, if I go slower, but I want minimal turns.\n\nPerhaps I can delay or something.\n\nSince y=7 at t=7 is safe, but then at t=8, if I go up to y=8, it is unsafe.\n\nI could stay or go down.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=7 at t=7, safe, then at t=8, instead of going up, I stay or go down.\n\nBut if I stay, at t=8, y=7.\n\nNow freeway 7 at t=8: unsafe, because freeway 7 unsafe at t=8,9.\n\nt=8 and t=9 are unsafe for y=7.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at t=2,3 and t=8,9.\n\nSo at t=8, if I am on y=7, it is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down to y=6 at t=8, y=6 at t=8: freeway 6 unsafe at t=8,9, so also unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at t=8, unsafe, and so on, down to y=2 at t=8 unsafe.\n\ny=1 at t=8: freeway 1 always safe, so if I am on y=1 at t=8, safe.\n\nBut I am at y=7 at t=7, so to be at y=1 at t=8, I need to go down 6 steps in one turn, impossible, I can only change by -1,0,+1.\n\nSo from y=7, at t=7, I can go to y=6,7,8 at t=8.\n\nBut all of y=6,7,8 are unsafe at t=8.\n\ny=6: freeway 6 unsafe t=8,9\n\ny=7: freeway 7 unsafe t=8,9\n\ny=8: freeway 8 unsafe t=8,9\n\nAnd y=1 safe, but I can't reach it in one step.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, all freeways from y=2 to y=8 are unsafe except y=1.\n\ny=1 always safe.\n\nBut at t=9, if I am on a freeway, it might be unsafe.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nIn the direct up path, I have problem at t=8.\n\nt=8 and t=9 are critical.\n\nNow, for t<8, it might be ok, but at t=7, y=7 is safe, as we saw.\n\nBut I need to pass through y=8 at some point.\n\ny=8 is unsafe only at t=2,3 and t=8,9.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSince t=8 and t=9 are unsafe for all freeways except y=1.\n\ny=1 is always safe.\n\nBut I need to be on y=1 at t=8 or t=9 to avoid collision.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut I start from y=0.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=1 earlier and stay or something.\n\nMinimal H: since I need to go up 9 levels, min H=9, but in H=9, I reach at t=9, but during the path, I might be unsafe.\n\nIn the direct path, at t=8, y=8 unsafe.\n\nI need to avoid being on any freeway at t=8 or t=9 except y=1.\n\nBut y=1 is freeway, safe at t=8,9.\n\nNow, at t=7, I am at y=7, which is safe only if I not at t=2,3,8,9; t=7 safe.\n\nFrom y=7 at t=7, I have options:\n\n- Go up to y=8 at t=8: but y=8 unsafe at t=8\n\n- Stay at y=7 at t=8: y=7 unsafe at t=8\n\n- Go down to y=6 at t=8: y=6 unsafe at t=8\n\nAll bad.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=7 at t=7 if I want to be safe at t=8, because whatever I do, at t=8 I will be on a unsafe freeway.\n\nUnless I can be at y=1 at t=8.\n\nBut from y=7, I can't reach y=1 in one step.\n\nSo I need to be at a lower y at t=7.\n\nFor example, if I am at y=1 at t=7, then at t=8, I can stay at y=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=9, I can go up to y=2, but y=2 at t=9 unsafe? y=2 unsafe at t=8,9, so at t=9, if on y=2, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=8, I am at y=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, I choose action:\n\nIf I go up to y=2 at t=9: y=2 unsafe at t=9, collision.\n\nIf I stay at y=1 at t=9: safe, but I am not at y=9.\n\nThen I need to go up later.\n\nBut that takes more turns.\n\nI can go to y=9 from y=8, but y=8 at t=9 unsafe.\n\nt=9 is unsafe for all y=2 to8 except y=1.\n\ny=1 safe at t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, if I am at y=1, I can go up to y=2 at t=10, but t=10 may be safe for some.\n\nFirst, let's find when the unsafe times end.\n\nFor example, for freeway 2, unsafe only t=8,9, so at t=10, safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 unsafe at t=8,9, and also at t=2,3, but t=10 is later, so safe.\n\nt=10, for y=2: freeway 2, unsafe only t=8,9, so t=10 safe.\n\nSimilarly y=3 to6 same.\n\ny=7: freeway 7 unsafe t=2,3,8,9, so t=10 safe.\n\ny=8: similar.\n\nSo after t=9, all safe except the earlier times.\n\nt=2,3 are past, since t starts from 0.\n\nAt t=0,1,2,... so t=2,3 are early.\n\nFor t>=10, all freeways are safe, I think.\n\ny=1 always safe.\n\ny=2: unsafe only t=8,9, so t=10 safe.\n\nSimilarly all others.\n\nSo from t=10 onwards, I can move freely.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMin H=9, but in H=9, with direct up, I have collision at t=8.\n\nCan I reach in H=9 with a different sequence?\n\nFor example, start at t=0 y=0.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=9 safe.\n\nBut during the path, at each t, y_t must be safe when on freeway.\n\nAt t=8, I must not be on y=2 to8, because all unsafe except y=1.\n\nSo at t=8, I must be at y=1 or y=0 or y=9.\n\ny=0 or y=9 are not freeways, so safe.\n\nBut y=9 at t=8 means I have reached earlier, but min to reach y=9 is 9 turns from y=0, so at t=8, y cannot be 9, since at t=0 y=0, after 8 actions, y<=8.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 at t=8 is possible if I go down, but I start from 0, going down not useful.\n\nSo at t=8, I must be at y=1 to be safe, since y=1 always safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, if I am on a freeway, it must be y=1, because others unsafe.\n\nBut at t=9, I can be at y=9, which is safe.\n\nIn the sequence to reach y=9 at t=9.\n\nAt t=8, I must be at y=1, because if I am at y=1, safe, and then from y=1 at t=8, I can go up to y=2 at t=9, but y=2 at t=9 unsafe, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf I am at y=1 at t=8, safe.\n\nThen action a8: if U, to y=2 at t=9, unsafe.\n\nIf S, stay y=1 at t=9, safe, but not at y=9.\n\nIf D, to y=0 at t=9, safe but lower.\n\nThen I need to go up later.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at t=9, I need to be at y=8 at t=8, but y=8 at t=8 unsafe.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 at t=9 without collision, because at t=8, I must be at y=8 to reach y=9 at t=9, but y=8 unsafe at t=8; or if I am at y=1 at t=8, I can only reach y=2 at t=9, not y=9.\n\nSo impossible in 9 turns.\n\nThus minimal H must be at least 10.\n\nNow, with H=10, I can reach at t=10.\n\nFor example, I can be at y=1 at t=8, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, I stay or something.\n\nLet me plan.\n\nI need to avoid being on freeways at t=8 and t=9 except y=1.\n\nSo I should be at y=1 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nThen after that, go up quickly.\n\nBut let's see the actions.\n\nStart t=0, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=1 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, y=1.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=8, I have 8 actions to go from y=0 to y=1, but since I can move slowly, I can arrive at y=1 at t=8.\n\nBut I might be at other places earlier.\n\nSince min turns to go up is 1 turn per level, but I can take more by staying or going down.\n\nBut to minimize H, I should not go down, only stay or up.\n\nH is the number of turns to reach, so to reach faster, I should go up as much as possible except when unsafe.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, I need to be on y=1.\n\nSo let's have a path where I am at y=1 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=9, I can be at y=1 or start going up.\n\nBut at t=9, if on y=1, safe, then at t=10, I can go to y=2, which is safe since t=10>9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nFirst, from t=0 to t=7, I need to be at y=1 at t=8.\n\nAt t=7, I must be at y=1 or y=2 or y=0, but to reach y=1 at t=8.\n\ny_{t} at turn t.\n\nAt t=7, y_7, then after action, y_8.\n\nIf I want y_8 =1, then y_7 can be 0,1,2.\n\nIf y_7=0, then a7=D? No, from y=0, if a7=D, y8= -1, but y must be in [0,9], so cannot go below 0.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y in [0,9], so from y=0, cannot go down, so Δy_t >=0 if y=0.\n\nSimilarly, from y=9, cannot go up.\n\nBut here y=0.\n\nSo from y=0, actions: U to y=1, or S to y=0.\n\nCannot D.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y_8=1.\n\ny_7 can be: if y_7=0, then a7=U to y8=1 or a7=S to y8=0.\n\nIf y_7=1, then a7=S to y8=1 or a7=D to y8=0 or a7=U to y8=2.\n\nIf y_7=2, then a7=D to y8=1.\n\nTo have y8=1, possible if:\n\n- y7=0 and a7=U\n\n- y7=1 and a7=S\n\n- y7=2 and a7=D\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nNow, back to safety.\n\nI need that at each turn, when on freeway, not unsafe.\n\nAlso, at t=8, I want to be at y=1.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, I can be at y=1 or y=2, but if I am at y=2 at t=9, unsafe, so better to stay at y=1 at t=9.\n\nThen at t=10, go up.\n\nBut let's first get to y=1 at t=8.\n\nNow, from start, I can go up quickly to some point, but need to arrive at y=1 at t=8.\n\nFor example, I can go directly to y=1 at t=1, then stay or move, but I need to be at y=1 at t=8.\n\nSince y=1 is always safe, I can stay at y=1 from some time to t=8.\n\nBut I start at y=0.\n\nMinimal way: go to y=1 as soon as possible, then stay until t=8.\n\nBut I can go to higher y earlier, but since other freeways are safe except at t=8,9, for t<8, I can be on them.\n\nFor example, at t=7, if I am at y=7, it is safe, but then I need to get to y=1 at t=8, impossible.\n\nSo I cannot be at high y at t=7.\n\nIn fact, at t=7, I must be at y such that I can be at y=1 at t=8.\n\nSo y7 must be 0,1,2.\n\nNow, y=0 at t=7: if I am at y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nThen a7=U to y8=1.\n\ny=1 at t=7: then I can a7=S to y8=1.\n\ny=2 at t=7: then a7=D to y8=1.\n\nNow, at t=7, if I am on freeway, must be safe.\n\ny=0 not freeway, safe.\n\ny=1: freeway 1, always safe.\n\ny=2: freeway 2, unsafe at t=8,9, but t=7 not 8 or 9, so safe? Yes, since unsafe only t=8,9 for y=2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 unsafe only t=8,9, so at t=7, safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nExcept for y=7 and y=8, which have unsafe at t=2,3, but t=7 not, so safe.\n\nSo at t=7, all y from 0 to 8 are safe, except if on freeway and unsafe time, but for t=7, only y=7 and y=8 have unsafe at t=2,3,8,9; t=7 not, so safe.\n\ny=7 at t=7 safe, as before.\n\nBut I need to be at low y to reach y=1 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, earlier.\n\nTo minimize time, I should go up as much as possible until t=7, but be at y=0,1, or 2 at t=7 so that I can be at y=1 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, I am at y=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=9, I can stay at y=1 (a8=S), so y9=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=10, I can go up to y=2, which is safe since t=10>9.\n\nThen continue up to y=9.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9 fast.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=9, I can go up each turn to y=9 at t=17? Too late.\n\nAt t=9, y9=1, then after actions:\n\na9=U, t=10 y=2\n\na10=U, t=11 y=3\n\n...\n\nup to a16=U, t=17 y=9? From y=1 to y=9, need 8 up actions, so at t=9 y=1, after k up actions, y=1+k at t=9+k.\n\nTo y=9, k=8, so t=17 y=9.\n\nBut H=17 turns? Too many, I think I can do better.\n\nSince after t=9, all safe, I can go up quickly.\n\nBut I wasted time staying at y=1.\n\nInstead, at t=8, I am at y=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, I can go up to y=2 at t=9, but y=2 at t=9 unsafe! Problem.\n\nAt t=9, if I am on y=2, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be on any freeway except y=1 at t=9.\n\nSo at t=9, I must be at y=0,1,9 or on y=1 freeway.\n\ny=9 not reached yet.\n\ny=0 or y=1.\n\nIf at t=8, I am at y=1, and I go up to y=2 at t=9, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at y=1 at t=9, safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut to avoid being on freeway at t=9 except y=1, I must be at y=1 at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, I must be at y=1 to be safe.\n\nSo I need to be at y=1 at both t=8 and t=9.\n\nThen at t=10, I can start going up.\n\nNow, how to get to y=1 at t=8 quickly.\n\nFrom start, I can go to y=1 at t=1 by a0=U.\n\nThen at t=1, y=1, safe.\n\nThen I can stay at y=1 from t=1 to t=9, but at t=9, I am at y=1, safe, but not at y=9.\n\nThen from t=10, go up to y=2 at t=10, y=3 at t=11, ..., y=9 at t=17.\n\nBut I reached y=1 at t=1, then stayed for 8 turns, then up 8 turns, total 16 actions to reach y=9 at t=17? Let's count turns.\n\nt=0: start y=0\n\na0=U, t=1 y=1\n\na1=S, t=2 y=1\n\n...\n\nup to a8=S, t=9 y=1\n\nThen a9=U, t=10 y=2\n\na10=U, t=11 y=3\n\na11=U, t=12 y=4\n\na12=U, t=13 y=5\n\na13=U, t=14 y=6\n\na14=U, t=15 y=7\n\na15=U, t=16 y=8\n\na16=U, t=17 y=9\n\nSo H=17 turns, reach at t=17.\n\nBut this is not minimal, because I stayed too long at y=1.\n\nI can go higher before t=8 and come down to y=1 at t=8.\n\nFor example, go to y=7 at t=7, which is safe, then at t=7, go down to y=6 at t=8, but y=6 at t=8 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nFrom y=7 at t=7, go down multiple steps, but I can only change one per turn.\n\nAt t=7, y=7, I can go to y=6,7,8 at t=8, all unsafe at t=8.\n\nSo I cannot be at high y at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, at t=6, I can be at higher y.\n\nLet's list the safe times for each freeway.\n\nFor y=1: always safe\n\ny=2: safe except t=8,9\n\ny=3: safe except t=8,9\n\ny=4: same\n\ny=5: same\n\ny=6: same\n\ny=7: safe except t=2,3,8,9\n\ny=8: safe except t=2,3,8,9\n\nFor t=7, all are safe since t=7 not in unsafe times.\n\nFor t=6, similarly safe for all.\n\nt=6, y=7: unsafe at t=2,3,8,9; t=6 not, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, to be at y=1 at t=8, I need to have y_7 such that I can reach y=1 at t=8.\n\ny_7 must be 0,1,2.\n\nAt t=7, if y_7=0,1,2, all are safe as above.\n\nSimilarly, to have y_7, I need to come from earlier.\n\nThe earliest I can be at high y is before t=8.\n\nFor example, I can be at y=8 at t=1, but let's see.\n\nStart t=0 y=0.\n\na0=U, t=1 y=1\n\na1=U, t=2 y=2\n\nAt t=2, y=2: freeway 2, unsafe at t=8,9, t=2 not, so safe.\n\na2=U, t=3 y=3, safe\n\na3=U, t=4 y=4, safe\n\na4=U, t=5 y=5, safe\n\na5=U, t=6 y=6, safe\n\na6=U, t=7 y=7, safe (t=7)\n\nNow at t=7, y=7, I need to get to y=1 at t=8.\n\nBut from y=7, I can only go to y=6,7,8 at t=8, all unsafe.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=7 at t=7 if I want to be at low y at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, if I am at y=6 at t=7, I can go to y=5,6,7 at t=8, all unsafe at t=8.\n\nSame for y=5, etc.\n\nOnly if I am at y=2 at t=7, I can go down to y=1 at t=8.\n\nOr at y=1, stay, or at y=0, go up.\n\nBut y=0 at t=7 is low.\n\nSo let's set that at t=7, I am at y=2.\n\nThen at t=7, a7=D, to y=1 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, y=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, a8=S, to y=1 at t=9, safe (since y=1 safe).\n\nThen at t=9, a9=U, to y=2 at t=10, safe (t=10)\n\nThen a10=U, t=11 y=3\n\n...\nup to a16=U, t=17 y=9? From y=2 at t=10 to y=9 at t=17, 7 actions, t=10 y=2, t=11 y=3, ..., t=16 y=8, t=17 y=9.\n\nBut I need to get to y=2 at t=7.\n\nHow?\n\nFrom start, go up to y=2 at some point.\n\nFor example, at t=0 y=0, a0=U, t=1 y=1\n\nThen a1=U, t=2 y=2\n\nThen I can stay at y=2 or move.\n\nBut I need to be at y=2 at t=7.\n\nSo from t=2 to t=7, I can stay at y=2 for 5 turns.\n\nThen at t=7, y=2, then a7=D to y=1 at t=8.\n\nThen a8=S to y=1 at t=9.\n\nThen a9=U to y=2 at t=10\n\na10=U to y=3 at t=11\n\na11=U to y=4 at t=12\n\na12=U to y=5 at t=13\n\na13=U to y=6 at t=14\n\na14=U to y=7 at t=15\n\na15=U to y=8 at t=16\n\na16=U to y=9 at t=17\n\nStill t=17.\n\nBut I can go higher before t=7.\n\nFor example, go to y=8 at t=6 or something.\n\nLet's see.\n\nAt t=6, I can be at high y.\n\nFor example, from start, go up fast:\n\nt=0 y=0 a0=U\n\nt=1 y=1\n\na1=U t=2 y=2\n\na2=U t=3 y=3\n\na3=U t=4 y=4\n\na4=U t=5 y=5\n\na5=U t=6 y=6\n\nAt t=6, y=6, safe.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=2 at t=7? No, at t=7 I need to be at y=0,1,2 to reach y=1 at t=8.\n\nFrom t=6 y=6, I can go down.\n\nFor example, at t=6, a6=D to y=5 at t=7\n\nBut at t=7, y=5, then how to get to y=1 at t=8? From y=5, I can go to y=4,5,6 at t=8, all unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nFrom y=6 at t=6, go down multiple steps, but I can only one per turn.\n\nAt t=6, y=6, I choose a6, then t=7 y= y6 + Δy\n\nIf Δy = -1, y=5 at t=7\n\nThen at t=7, a7, then t=8 y= y7 + Δy\n\nFrom y=5, I can go to y=4,5,6 at t=8, all unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=6 I go down to y=5, same.\n\nIf I go down faster earlier.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=8 at t=8, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAnother idea: since t=2 and t=3 are unsafe for y=7 and y=8, but I can avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at t=2,3.\n\nBut in this case, for min H, it might not be necessary.\n\nBut in our case, to reach fast, I can be on high y at early turns.\n\nFor example, at t=1, I can be at y=1\n\nt=2, y=2\n\nt=3, y=3\n\netc.\n\nAt t=3, y=3 is safe.\n\nCan I be at y=8 at t=1? No, only one step per turn.\n\nMax at t=1 y=1, t=2 y=2, ..., t=8 y=8.\n\nBut y=8 at t=8 unsafe.\n\nSo the highest I can be at t=7 is y=7.\n\nBut at t=7, y=7, I cannot go to a safe position at t=8 except if I could go to y=1, impossible.\n\nThe only safe position at t=8 is y=1 (or y=0, but y=0 not freeway, safe, but from y=7, can't reach).\n\ny=0 at t=8 is safe, but how to get there from start.\n\nFor example, if I am at y=0 at t=7, then a7=U to y=1 at t=8.\n\nThen y=1 at t=8 safe.\n\nThen at t=8, a8=S to y=1 at t=9 safe.\n\nThen from t=9, go up.\n\nBut to be at y=0 at t=7, I need to have stayed at y=0 or gone down, but from start, I can be at y=0 at t=0, then stay for 7 turns? Then at t=7 y=0, a7=U to t=8 y=1, then a8=S to t=9 y=1, then start going up, reach y=9 at t=17 or later, worse.\n\nI can go up to some point and come down to y=0 at t=7.\n\nBut coming down takes time.\n\nFor example, suppose at some point I go up to y=7 at t=7, but then I can go down to y=0 in 7 turns, but at t=7 I am at y=7, not y=0.\n\nTo be at y=0 at t=7, I must have been at y=0 or y=1 at t=6, etc.\n\nIt takes time to come down.\n\nSo it seems that the fastest way is to be at y=1 at t=8 and t=9, then go up from t=10.\n\nBut to be at y=1 at t=8, I can arrive there early and stay, or arrive late.\n\nThe latest I can arrive at y=1 is at t=8, by going up slowly or staying low.\n\nBut to minimize total time, I should go up as fast as possible to a point, but not too high that I can't come down for t=8.\n\nSince I need to be at low y at t=8, I should not go high before.\n\nSo the optimal is to go directly to y=1 at t=1, then stay at y=1 until t=9, then go up from t=10 to t=17.\n\nBut H=17.\n\nI can be at higher y at t=10.\n\nAnother idea: at t=9, I am at y=1, safe.\n\nInstead of staying, at t=9, I can go to y=2, but at t=9, y=2 unsafe, so I cannot.\n\nMust stay at y=1 at t=9.\n\nSo I have to lose at least two turns: t=8 and t=9 at y=1.\n\nThen from t=10, go up to y=9 in 8 turns, at t=17.\n\nBut min from y=0 to y=9 is 9 turns, but because of obstacles, I take 17, seems long.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 at t=10.\n\nBut from y=0, at t=0, after 10 actions, max y=10, but y=9 max, so y=9 at t=10 possible.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=10, I need to be at y=8 at t=9 or y=9 at t=9, etc.\n\nAt t=9, I cannot be on y=8 because unsafe, and y=9 not reached.\n\nIf I am at y=8 at t=9, unsafe.\n\nIf at t=9, I am at y=1, I can go to y=2 at t=10, not y=9.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=9 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, earliest I can be at y=9 is after t=9, since at t=9 I cannot be at high y.\n\nAt t=10, I can be at y=10, but y=9 max, so at t=10, y=10 not possible, y<=9.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=9, after k actions, y=1+k at t=9+k.\n\nSet 1+k=9, k=8, t=17.\n\nOr if I can be at higher than 1 at t=9, but I can't because at t=9, only y=1 is safe for freeway, or y=0 or y=9.\n\ny=9 at t=9 not possible from start in 9 turns with obstacles.\n\ny=0 at t=9 is low.\n\nSo yes, minimal H is 17 with the path I had.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can avoid the stay.\n\nNotice that at t=2 and t=3, y=7 and y=8 are unsafe, but in the early turns, I am at low y, so not on y=7 or 8 at t=2,3.\n\nFor example, at t=2, I am at y=2 or less, safe.\n\nt=3 similar.\n\nSo no issue there.\n\nThe only problem is t=8 and t=9 for all freeways 2-8 except y=1.\n\nSo I must spend t=8 and t=9 on y=1.\n\nThen start from there.\n\nBut to reach y=1 at t=8, I can do it faster.\n\nFor example, from t=0 to t=1, go to y=1 at t=1 with a0=U.\n\nThen from t=1 to t=8, I stay at y=1 for 7 turns (actions a1 to a7 all S), so at t=8 y=1.\n\nThen a8=S, t=9 y=1.\n\nThen a9=U, t=10 y=2\n\na10=U, t=11 y=3\n\na11=U, t=12 y=4\n\na12=U, t=13 y=5\n\na13=U, t=14 y=6\n\na14=U, t=15 y=7\n\na15=U, t=16 y=8\n\na16=U, t=17 y=9\n\nH=17 actions.\n\nBut I can reduce by not staying from t=1 to t=8.\n\nFor example, I can go to higher y and come back, but coming back takes time and I might be on freeway at unsafe time, but since only t=8,9 unsafe, for t<8, I can be on high y.\n\nFor example, go to y=8 at t=8, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo to y=8 at t=7, safe, but then at t=7, I need to go down, but to reach y=1 at t=8, I can only go to y=7 at t=8 if I stay, unsafe.\n\nSo I have to be at low y at t=7.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=7 at t=7, safe, but then I can only go to y=6,7,8 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nSo I must not be at high y at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, at t=7, I must be at y=0,1,2.\n\nSo the highest I can be at t=7 is y=2.\n\nThen from there, I go down to y=1 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=7 y=2, I was at y=2 at t=7, which is safe, then a7=D to y=1 at t=8.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nTo be at y=2 at t=7, I can reach there at t=2 by a0=U, a1=U, t=2 y=2.\n\nThen stay at y=2 from t=2 to t=7 with actions a2 to a6 all S, so at t=7 y=2.\n\nThen a7=D to y=1 at t=8.\n\nThen a8=S to y=1 at t=9.\n\nThen a9=U to y=2 at t=10\n\netc, same as before, reach y=9 at t=17.\n\nIf I go higher before, say to y=3 at t=3, then I need to come down to y=2 at t=7, but coming down takes turns.\n\nFor example, at t=3 y=3, I can stay or go down.\n\nTo be at y=2 at t=7, I can go down slowly.\n\nBut each down action takes a turn, so if I am at y=3 at t=3, to be at y=2 at t=7, I can stay at y=3 for some time, but then at t=7 I need y=2, so I must go down at some point.\n\nFor example, at t=3 y=3, stay with S until t=6 y=3, then at t=6 a6=D to y=2 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7 y=2, a7=D to y=1 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=6, y=3, safe, a6=D to t=7 y=2.\n\nThen a7=D to t=8 y=1.\n\nThen a8=S to t=9 y=1.\n\nThen go up from t=10.\n\nBut I reached y=3 at t=3, then stayed from t=3 to t=6 at y=3 (3 turns), then down to y=2 at t=7, down to y=1 at t=8, then stay at t=9, then up.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=3: 3 actions to y=3.\n\nThen t=3 to t=6: stay, 3 actions, y=3.\n\nt=6: a6=D, y=2 at t=7\n\nt=7: a7=D, y=1 at t=8\n\nt=8: a8=S, y=1 at t=9\n\nt=9: a9=U, y=2 at t=10\n\nthen t=10 to t=17: 7 actions to y=9? From y=2 at t=10 to y=9 at t=17, 7 up actions: t=10 y=2, t=11 y=3, ..., t=16 y=8, t=17 y=9, yes.\n\nTotal actions: from t=0 to t=9, 10 actions, but y at t=9 is 1, not 9.\n\nH is the number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=1, after a9 to a16, 8 actions, total from a0 to a16, 17 actions.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAnd I used more actions by going to y=3 and staying.\n\nWorse than going directly to y=1 and staying.\n\nSo the minimal H is 17, with the first path: go to y=1 at t=1, stay until t=9, then go up to y=9 at t=17.\n\nBut in this path, at t=2 to t=7, I am at y=1, which is safe, no problem.\n\nAt t=8 and t=9, also at y=1, safe.\n\nThen from t=10 to t=17, go up, all safe after t=9.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nSuppose at t=9, I am at y=1, safe.\n\nInstead of going up immediately, but I have to.\n\nOr, can I be at y=9 at t=10?\n\nFrom y=1 at t=9, after one action, y=2 at t=10, not 9.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSo min H=17.\n\nBut let's double-check the car states.\n\nPerhaps for some freeways, at t=8,9, it is safe if no car at 0.\n\nBut for y=2 to 6, unsafe at t=8,9.\n\ny=7 and 8 also unsafe at t=8,9.\n\ny=1 safe.\n\nSo no.\n\nAnother thought: the collision only occurs if I am on the freeway and 0 in span at the same turn.\n\nBut at t=8, for y=2 to 8, all have cars at 0.\n\nFor example, y=2 at t=8: span [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 in it.\n\nSimilarly all.\n\nSo yes.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=9 at t=9.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=9, I need to be at y=8 at t=8 or y=9 at t=8.\n\ny=9 at t=8 not possible.\n\ny=8 at t=8 unsafe.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nThus, minimal H is 17.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can start later, but I think not.\n\nOr, at t=0, I can stay or something, but similar.\n\nSo I think H=17 is the min.\n\nBut let's see the sequence for the path.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nAction a0 = U, to y=1 at t=1\n\nThen actions a1 to a7: all S, so y stays at 1 from t=1 to t=8? Let's see:\n\nAfter a0 at t=0, position at t=1 is y=1.\n\nThen at turn t=1, I am at y=1, choose a1=S, so position at t=2 is y=1.\n\nSimilarly, a2=S, t=3 y=1\n\n...\n\na7=S, t=8 y=1\n\nThen at t=8, I am at y=1, choose a8=S, so t=9 y=1\n\nThen a9=U, t=10 y=2\n\na10=U, t=11 y=3\n\na11=U, t=12 y=4\n\na12=U, t=13 y=5\n\na13=U, t=14 y=6\n\na14=U, t=15 y=7\n\na15=U, t=16 y=8\n\na16=U, t=17 y=9\n\nNow, at each turn, check safety:\n\nt=0: y=0, safe\n\nt=1: y=1, freeway 1, safe\n\nt=2: y=1, freeway 1, safe\n\n...\n\nt=7: y=1, freeway 1, safe\n\nt=8: y=1, freeway 1, safe\n\nt=9: y=1, freeway 1, safe\n\nt=10: y=2, freeway 2, unsafe at t=8,9, t=10 safe\n\nt=11: y=3, safe\n\nt=12: y=4, safe\n\nt=13: y=5, safe\n\nt=14: y=6, safe\n\nt=15: y=7, freeway 7, unsafe at t=2,3,8,9; t=15 safe\n\nt=16: y=8, freeway 8, unsafe at t=2,3,8,9; t=16 safe\n\nt=17: y=9, safe\n\nNo collisions.\n\nAnd H=17 actions.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose I go to y=2 at t=2, then stay until t=7, then at t=7 go down to y=1 at t=8, etc, but same number of actions.\n\nOr, at t=9, instead of staying, I have to.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=9, I can be at y=0, but that would require going down earlier, which takes more actions, worse.\n\nSo I think 17 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 7 and 8 at t=2,3.\n\nFor example, at t=2, if I were on y=7, it would be unsafe, but in this path, at t=2, I am at y=1 or 2, not 7, so fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo for the sequence.\n\nThe answer should be actions from t=0 to t=16.\n\nIn the format, it says {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, with t1=0.\n\nSo actions a_0 to a_{16}.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 0: a_0 = U\n\nThen Turn 1: a_1 = S\n\nTurn 2: a_2 = S\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 7: a_7 = S  (since a1 to a7 are S, but a1 is for turn 1)\n\nList:\n\nTurn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt1=0, so turn 0, turn 1, ..., turn 16 for H=17 actions.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S  (this keeps y=1 from turn 1 to turn 8)\n\nAfter turn 7 action, position at turn 8 is y=1.\n\nThen Turn 8: S  (stay, so turn 9 y=1)\n\nTurn 9: U  (turn 10 y=2)\n\nTurn 10: U  (turn 11 y=3)\n\nTurn 11: U  (turn 12 y=4)\n\nTurn 12: U  (turn 13 y=5)\n\nTurn 13: U  (turn 14 y=6)\n\nTurn 14: U  (turn 15 y=7)\n\nTurn 15: U  (turn 16 y=8)\n\nTurn 16: U  (turn 17 y=9)\n\nIn the sequence, the actions are for the turns.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t: action\n\nFor turn 0 to turn 16.\n\nBut at turn 16, action U, to reach y=9 at turn 17.\n\nYes.\n\nTo make it shorter, but I don't think so.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up later, but I think not better.\n\nSo I think this is it.\n\nBut in the sequence, from turn 1 to turn 7, I have S, which is 7 S actions, but I can have fewer S if I go up and down, but not beneficial.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) is 17, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed to:\n- Move up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 1.\n- Stay at \\(y = 1\\) from turn 1 to turn 9 to avoid collisions during turns 8 and 9, when all freeways \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are unsafe due to cars covering position 0.\n- After turn 9, move up one level per turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17.\n\nThe actions are as follows:\n\n- At turn 0, move up to reach \\(y = 1\\) at turn 1.\n- From turn 1 to turn 8, stay at \\(y = 1\\) to remain safe during the critical turns 8 and 9 (turn 8: at \\(y = 1\\), safe; turn 9: at \\(y = 1\\), safe).\n- At turn 9, stay again to ensure safety at turn 9 (though moving up would be unsafe as \\(y = 2\\) is unsafe at turn 9).\n- From turn 10 to turn 16, move up each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions:\n- Turns 0: \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway).\n- Turns 1-9: \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1, always safe).\n- Turn 10: \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2, safe at \\(t = 10\\) as unsafe only at \\(t = 8, 9\\)).\n- Turn 11: \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3, safe at \\(t = 11\\)).\n- Turn 12: \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, safe at \\(t = 12\\)).\n- Turn 13: \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5, safe at \\(t = 13\\)).\n- Turn 14: \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, safe at \\(t = 14\\)).\n- Turn 15: \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7, safe at \\(t = 15\\) as unsafe only at \\(t = 2, 3, 8, 9\\)).\n- Turn 16: \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8, safe at \\(t = 16\\) as unsafe only at \\(t = 2, 3, 8, 9\\)).\n- Turn 17: \\(y = 9\\) (safe, not a freeway).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T at that turn and the car on that freeway has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nNote: The player updates position at the same time as the cars move. When the player moves to a new freeway, they are not considered on that freeway until the next turn.\n\nCar update rules:\n- Left-moving: span moves left (decreasing x)\n- Right-moving: span moves right (increasing x)\n\nBut note: the given cars are all right-moving (direction is \"right\"). So for a car at time t1 (turn 4) with (head, tail, direction, speed), at a future turn T (>= t1), the span becomes:\n  [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]   because for right-moving, originally the head is at a larger x than the tail? But wait, the representation is (head, tail). \n\nLooking at the example for right-moving: \n  Original span at t1: [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the table, the cars are given as (head, tail, ...). For right-moving, the head is the front (larger x) and tail is the back (smaller x). So the span is [tail, head] at t1? Actually, the representation says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning that tau is the tail (smaller) and h is the head (larger). \n\nIn the data, for freeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 12). \n  So h = -24, tau = -35. Then the span at t1 is [tau, h] = [-35, -24]. \n\nBut note: the representation in the table is (head, tail) and then direction. So for a right-moving car, the head is at a larger x than the tail? Actually, -24 is larger than -35? Yes. So the head is at x=-24 and tail at x=-35. Then at time T, the car moves to [ -35 + 12*(T-4), -24 + 12*(T-4) ].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 7 and 8, we have multiple cars.\n\nOur goal: we start at (0,3) at turn 4. We can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). We must avoid being on a freeway y at turn T if there is a car on freeway y such that 0 is in [tail + s*(T-4), head + s*(T-4)] for that car.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. We start at y=3. We can only change y by at most 1 per turn. So we need at least 6 moves (all U) to go from 3 to 9. But we might have to wait (use S) to avoid collisions.\n\nWe are to output the actions for turns 4, 5, 6, ... until we reach 9.\n\nLet me denote the turn relative to t1: let t = 0 correspond to turn t1=4. Then at time t (relative), the absolute turn is T = 4 + t.\n\nPlayer position at time t (relative) is y_t. We start at t=0: y0 = 3.\n\nWe want y_H = 9 for the first time at relative time H (so we take H actions: from t=0 to t=H-1).\n\nAt each relative time t (so absolute turn T = 4+t), the player is at y_t. We must ensure that if the player is on a freeway k (which is between 1 and 8) at that turn, then no car on freeway k at turn T (absolute) has 0 in its span.\n\nBut note: at the moment of moving, when we decide an action at time t (absolute turn T=4+t), we are going to be at freeway y_t at the beginning of the turn? Actually, the collision condition is: at turn T, if the player is at (0, y_T) and y_T is between 1 and 8, then we check the cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nThe note says: if at turn T you move to y_{T+1} (which is different from y_T) then at turn T you are still on y_T and then at turn T+1 you are on y_{T+1}. So:\n\n- At the absolute turn T, the player is at y_T (which is the position at the start of the turn? Actually, the update: we are given that at turn t1 (T=4) we are at (0,3). Then we choose an action a_4 that determines y_5? But note the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t. So:\n\n  At turn T (absolute), the player is at y_T. Then we choose a_T, and then y_{T+1} = y_T + Delta.\n\nTherefore, during turn T, the player is at y_T. So if y_T is between 1 and 8, we must check the cars on freeway y_T at turn T (absolute) for collision.\n\nHow to compute the car positions at turn T (absolute) = 4+t (relative time t)?\n\nFor a car given at turn 4 (t1=4) with (head, tail, direction, speed), we have:\n\n  For right-moving: \n      tail(T) = tail(4) + s*(T-4)\n      head(T) = head(4) + s*(T-4)\n\nWe need 0 to be not in [tail(T), head(T)] for every car on the freeway we are on at turn T.\n\nLet's list the cars per freeway at turn 4 (t1=4):\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=-24, tail=-35, right, speed=12) -> span at T: [-35 + 12*(T-4), -24 + 12*(T-4)]\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (head=-24, tail=-35, right, speed=6) -> [-35 + 6*(T-4), -24 + 6*(T-4)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (head=-24, tail=-35, right, speed=6)\n\nFreeway 4: same.\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: \n  car1: (-24, -35, right, 6) -> [-35+6*(T-4), -24+6*(T-4)]\n  car2: (12, 1, right, 6) -> [1+6*(T-4), 12+6*(T-4)]\n  car3: (48, 37, right, 6) -> [37+6*(T-4), 48+6*(T-4)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7.\n\nWe are starting at y=3 at turn 4. We want to go to y=9.\n\nWe must avoid:\n\nAt any turn T (absolute) and for the freeway y_T we are on (if between 1 and 8), we must avoid having 0 in any car span on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNote: at the goal, y=9 is above the freeways (freeways are y=1..8), so when we are at y=9, we are safe (no cars there). Also, y=0 is safe (no cars) but we are starting at y=3 and going up.\n\nWe need to compute the positions of the cars at each future turn.\n\nWe are going to simulate the player moving up, and we want the minimal H. Since we can only move one step per turn, the minimal H without any obstacles is 6 (all U). But we have to avoid collisions.\n\nLet me compute the dangerous intervals for each freeway and each turn.\n\nFirst, note that we are only concerned with turns from T=4 (current) until we reach 9. Since we can move at most 1 per turn, we won't go beyond 9, and we must stop at 9.\n\nWe'll consider relative time t (from 0) so absolute turn T = 4+t.\n\nWe are at y_0 = 3 (at t=0, absolute turn 4).\n\nWe want to compute for each freeway and each t (>=0) the condition: is there a car on that freeway at turn T=4+t such that 0 is in the span?\n\nWe'll do for freeways 1 to 8.\n\nFreeway 1:\n  Car: [ -35 + 12*t, -24 + 12*t ]   (since T-4 = t)\n  We require 0 not in [ -35+12t, -24+12t ]\n  => 0 < -35+12t  OR  0 > -24+12t\n  => 12t < 35  OR  12t > 24\n  => t < 35/12 ≈ 2.916  OR  t > 24/12 = 2\n\n  So for t<=2: 12t<=24 -> then 0 is in the interval? \n      At t=0: [-35, -24] -> 0 is not in (since both negative) -> safe? Actually, 0 is not in [-35,-24] because -35<=0<=-24 is false (0 is greater than -24). \n  Actually, the interval is [a,b] with a=-35+12t, b=-24+12t.\n  We want 0 not in [a,b] i.e., either 0 < a or 0 > b.\n\n  Condition 1: 0 < -35+12t  => 12t > 35 => t > 35/12 ≈ 2.916\n  Condition 2: 0 > -24+12t  => 12t < 24 => t < 2\n\n  Therefore, the freeway 1 is dangerous (0 in the span) when 2 <= t <= 2.916? Actually, the condition for safe is t<2 OR t>2.916.\n\n  Alternatively, dangerous when 2 <= t <= 2.916? But t is integer. So t=2 and t=3? Let's check:\n\n  t=0: [-35, -24] -> safe (0 not in)\n  t=1: [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23, -12] -> safe\n  t=2: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0] -> 0 is included? Yes! So dangerous at t=2.\n  t=3: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> safe (0 not in)\n\n  So freeway 1 is dangerous only at t=2 (absolute turn 4+2=6).\n\nFreeway 2:\n  Car: [-35+6t, -24+6t]\n  Safe when: 0 < -35+6t OR 0 > -24+6t\n  => 6t>35 => t>35/6≈5.833   OR  6t<24 => t<4.\n\n  So dangerous when 4<=t<=5.833? Check integer t:\n\n  t=0: [-35,-24] -> safe\n  t=1: [-29,-18] -> safe\n  t=2: [-23,-12] -> safe\n  t=3: [-17,-6] -> safe\n  t=4: [-11,0] -> dangerous (0 in the interval)\n  t=5: [-5,6] -> 0 is in [ -5,6] -> dangerous\n  t=6: [1,12] -> safe\n\n  So freeway 2 is dangerous at t=4 and t=5.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 3,4,5,6: same as freeway 2? Because same car: (-24,-35,right,6). So they are dangerous at t=4 and t=5.\n\nNow freeway 7 (and 8) have three cars.\n\nCar1: same as above: [-35+6t, -24+6t] -> dangerous at t=4,5.\nCar2: [1+6t, 12+6t] -> \n  Safe when: 0 < 1+6t OR 0>12+6t -> but 0>12+6t is impossible (t>=0). So only safe if 0<1+6t -> 6t>-1, which is always true? \n  Actually, we require 0 not in [1+6t, 12+6t]. Since 1+6t >=1 (for t>=0) and 12+6t>=12, then 0 is never in this interval. So car2 is always safe.\n\nCar3: [37+6t, 48+6t] -> \n  This is always positive for t>=0, so 0 is never in the interval. Safe.\n\nTherefore, for freeway 7 and 8, the only dangerous times are from car1: at t=4 and t=5.\n\nSummary of dangerous freeways and times (relative t):\n\nFreeway 1: dangerous at t=2 (absolute turn 6)\nFreeways 2,3,4,5,6: dangerous at t=4,5 (absolute turns 8,9)\nFreeways 7,8: dangerous at t=4,5 (absolute turns 8,9)\n\nNow, we start at t=0, y0=3.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nWe are at y=3 at t=0 (absolute turn 4). We are on freeway 3? But note: the freeways are y=1 to 8. The player is at y=3 at turn 4. Since y=3 is a freeway (freeway 3), we must check freeway 3 at turn 4.\n\nBut at turn 4 (t=0), freeway 3: \n  We computed that freeway 3 is safe at t=0? Yes, because for freeway 3, the car is at [-35, -24] (at t=0) -> safe.\n\nSo we are safe at t=0.\n\nNow, we plan the moves.\n\nWe need to go from y=3 to y=9. We can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). But we want minimal turns, so we prefer U.\n\nHowever, we must avoid:\n\n- At turn t (relative) we are at y_t. Then we must avoid the dangerous freeways at that time.\n\nWe are going to simulate for t=0,1,2,... until we reach 9.\n\nWe are at:\n  t=0: y0=3 -> freeway 3, which is safe (as above).\n\nWe choose an action for t=0 (absolute turn 4) that will determine y1.\n\nWe want to minimize H, so we try to go up as much as possible.\n\nOption: go U at t=0: then y1 = 4.\n\nNow, at t=1 (absolute turn 5): we are at y1=4. Freeway 4 at turn 5 (relative t=1): \n  Check freeway 4: dangerous at t=4 and 5? Our dangerous times for freeway 4 are at t=4 and 5 (relative). At t=1, it is safe? \n  For freeway 4: the car at turn 5 (t=1): \n      span = [-35+6*1, -24+6*1] = [-29, -18] -> safe.\n\nSo we can go to 4 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, we choose action for y2. We go U: y2=5 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2 (absolute turn 6): we are at y2=5. Freeway 5: dangerous at t=4 and 5? So at t=2, freeway 5: \n  span = [-35+6*2, -24+6*2] = [-23, -12] -> safe.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that freeway 1 is dangerous at t=2? But we are on freeway 5, not 1. So we are safe.\n\nThen we go U: y3=6 at t=3 (absolute turn 7).\n\nAt t=3: y3=6. Freeway 6: dangerous at t=4 and 5? So at t=3: \n  freeway 6: [-35+6*3, -24+6*3] = [-17, -6] -> safe.\n\nThen U: y4=7 at t=4 (absolute turn 8).\n\nAt t=4: we are at freeway 7. And freeway 7 is dangerous at t=4 and 5? Yes! \n  For freeway 7, car1: at t=4: [-35+6*4, -24+6*4] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0] -> 0 is included -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on freeway 7 at t=4 (absolute turn 8).\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being at freeway 7 at t=4.\n\nWe have to change the plan.\n\nAt t=3 (absolute turn 7), we are at y3=6. Instead of going up to 7, we might:\n\nOption 1: stay at 6 at t=4? Then we are at freeway 6 at t=4. But freeway 6 is dangerous at t=4: \n  freeway 6: at t=4: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> dangerous.\n\nSo we cannot stay at 6 either.\n\nOption 2: go down? But we are at 6, if we go down to 5 at t=4, then we are at freeway 5 at t=4. Freeway 5 is dangerous at t=4: same as above? \n  freeway 5: [-35+6*4, -24+6*4] = [-11,0] -> dangerous.\n\nSo we cannot be on freeways 5,6,7,8 at t=4? Actually, freeways 2 to 8 are dangerous at t=4? \n\nWait: freeways 2,3,4,5,6: each has one car that is dangerous at t=4 and t=5.\nFreeways 7,8: also dangerous at t=4 and t=5.\n\nBut what about freeway 1? Freeway 1 is only dangerous at t=2.\n\nSo at t=4, freeways 2 to 8 are all dangerous. Only freeway 1 is safe at t=4? \n  freeway 1 at t=4: \n      [-35+12*4, -24+12*4] = [-35+48, -24+48] = [13,24] -> safe.\n\nBut we are at y=6 at t=3. How can we get to freeway 1 by t=4? We can only move one step per turn. From y=6 at t=3, we can only go to 5,6,7 at t=4. We cannot jump to freeway 1 (which is y=1) in one step.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on freeways 2 to 8 at t=4, but we cannot get to freeway 1 either. The only safe freeway at t=4 is freeway 1? But we can't get there.\n\nWhat about y=0? \n  The problem says: the grid has vertical axis y=0,1,...,9. And collision occurs only for freeways y=1..8. So if we are at y=0 at turn T, there are no cars, so it's safe. Similarly, y=9 is safe.\n\nSo at t=4, we can be at y=0 or y=9? But we are at y=6 at t=3. We can only move one step. We can get to y=5,6,7. We cannot get to y=0 or y=9 in one step.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on any freeway (y=1 to 8) at t=4 and t=5.\n\nBut we are at y=6 at t=3. How?\n\nWe must be at y=0 or y=9 at t=4? But we can't. Alternatively, we can be at a freeway that is safe? But we saw that freeways 1 to 8 are all dangerous at t=4 and t=5? Actually, freeway 1 is safe at t=4? But we can't get there.\n\nWait, let me recheck freeway 1 at t=4: we computed [13,24] -> safe? Yes. But we are at y=6 at t=3. To get to freeway 1 (y=1) at t=4, we would have to move down 5 steps in one turn? Not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only safe positions at t=4 are y=0 and y=9. Since we are at y=6, we can only get to y=5,6,7. None of these are safe? \n\nBut wait, are freeways 1 to 8 the only ones that have cars? Yes. So if we are at y=0 or y=9, we are safe. But we cannot get to y=9 from y=6 in one step (we can only get to 7). And we cannot get to y=0 from 6 in one step (we can only get to 5).\n\nSo what can we do? We must change the path earlier.\n\nWe must be at a safe position at t=4. The safe positions at t=4 are y=0, y=9, and freeway 1? But we can't get to freeway1. So only y=0 and y=9. But we are at y=3 at t=0. How can we get to y=0 or y=9 by t=4?\n\nWe have 4 moves (t=0,1,2,3) to go from y=3 to either y=0 or y=9.\n\nTo get to y=9: from 3 to 9: 6 steps, but we only have 4 moves -> impossible (max we can go is 3+4=7).\n\nTo get to y=0: from 3 to 0: 3 steps down. We can do that in 3 moves: D,D,D. Then we would be at y=0 at t=3? But we need to be safe at t=4. Actually, we are at position at the start of the turn.\n\nBut note: at t=3 (absolute turn 7), we are at y_3. Then we choose an action that leads to y_4. We want to be at a safe position at the start of turn t=4 (absolute turn 8) which is y_4.\n\nSo if we are at y_4=0, that is safe.\n\nSo plan: go down to 0 by t=4? \n\nBut we have 4 moves: from t=0 to t=3 (4 actions) to set y1, y2, y3, y4.\n\nWe start at t0: y0=3.\n\nt0 (action a0): we can go D: y1=2.\nt1: D: y2=1.\nt2: D: y3=0.\nThen at t3: we can choose an action, but we are at y3=0. Then at t4 (the next state) we are at y4 = y3 + Delta. But we want y4 to be safe. We can choose to stay at 0: then y4=0 (safe) or move up to 1? But at t4, if we are at y4=1, that is freeway1? But we computed freeway1 at t4 is safe? Actually, we computed for freeway1 at t4: [13,24] -> safe. So we could be at freeway1 at t4? \n\nBut wait, we are at y3=0 at t3. Then we choose an action at t3: if we choose U, then y4=1. If we choose S, y4=0.\n\nBut we want to eventually get to 9. So if we go down to 0 and then we have to come back up, that would take more turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to avoid being on any freeway at t=4 and t=5 by being at y=0 or y=9 at those turns.\n\nBut we cannot reach y=9 by t=4. So we must be at y=0 at t=4? \n\nSo plan: \n  t0: D -> y1=2\n  t1: D -> y2=1\n  t2: D -> y3=0\n  t3: S -> y4=0   (so at turn 8, we are at 0 -> safe)\n\nThen at t4 (absolute turn 8) we are at 0. Now we can start moving up.\n\nBut we want to minimize H. This already uses 4 moves and we are at 0. Then we have to go from 0 to 9: 9 moves (all U). So total H = 4 (to get to turn 8) + 9 moves? Actually, at t=4 we have taken 4 actions (t0 to t3) and we are at y4=0. Then we need to take 9 more actions to get to y=9? \n\nWait: we are at y4=0 at the start of turn 8 (t=4 relative). Then we choose actions for turn 8 (absolute) which is the 5th action (t4 relative). \n\nWe need to go from 0 to 9: 9 steps. So we need 9 actions (all U) starting at t4. Then at the end of the 9th action, we are at y_{4+9}=9. \n\nSo total relative time: t=0 to t=12 (13 states) but the number of actions is 13? \n\nActually, we take actions at t=0,1,...,12 (13 actions) and then at the next state (after 13 actions) we are at y_13=9? \n\nBut we start at t0: y0=3.\nAfter 1st action (t0): y1=?\n...\nAfter k actions: we are at y_k.\n\nWe want the minimal H such that after H actions, we are at y_H = 9.\n\nIn this plan:\n\nAction 0 (t0): D -> y1=2\nAction 1 (t1): D -> y2=1\nAction 2 (t2): D -> y3=0\nAction 3 (t3): S -> y4=0   (we are still at 0 after 4 actions? Actually, after 4 actions we have y4=0)\n\nThen we do:\nAction 4 (t4): U -> y5=1\nAction 5: U -> y6=2\nAction 6: U -> y7=3\nAction 7: U -> y8=4\nAction 8: U -> y9=5\nAction 9: U -> y10=6\nAction 10: U -> y11=7\nAction 11: U -> y12=8\nAction 12: U -> y13=9\n\nSo H=13.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWe could avoid going all the way down to 0 and then up.\n\nAnother idea: we can be at freeway1 at t=4? Because freeway1 is safe at t=4. But we are at y=3 at t0. How to get to y=1 at t4? \n\nWe have 4 moves: from y0=3 to y4=1: we need to go down 2 steps. So we can do: D, D, then two S? \n\nBut we must avoid being on dangerous freeways at the intermediate turns.\n\nPlan to be at y=1 at t4 (relative):\n\n  t0: at y0=3. We need to get to y4=1.\n\n  We can do:\n    t0: D -> y1=2 (freeway2) at t1 (absolute turn5) -> check freeway2 at t1: we computed safe? At t1, freeway2: [-35+6*1, -24+6*1] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\n    t1: D -> y2=1 (freeway1) at t2 (absolute turn6) -> freeway1 at t2: we know dangerous at t2? Freeway1 is dangerous at t2: [-11,0] -> collision! \n\nSo we cannot be at freeway1 at t2.\n\nAlternatively, at t1 we don't go down? \n\nWe want to be at y=1 at t4. We can do:\n\n  t0: S -> y1=3 (freeway3 at t1: turn5) -> freeway3 at t1: [-29,-18] -> safe.\n  t1: D -> y2=2 (freeway2 at t2: turn6) -> freeway2 at t2: [-23,-12] -> safe? Yes, because 0 is not in [-23,-12].\n  t2: D -> y3=1 (freeway1 at t3: turn7) -> freeway1 at t3: [-35+12*3, -24+12*3] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> safe (0 not in).\n  t3: S -> y4=1 (freeway1 at t4: turn8) -> freeway1 at t4: [13,24] -> safe.\n\nSo this works: we are at y=1 at t4 (safe). Then we can start moving up.\n\nNow, we are at y4=1. Then we want to go to 9: 8 steps up. \n\nSo actions:\n  t0: S (stay at 3) -> y1=3\n  t1: D (to 2) -> y2=2\n  t2: D (to 1) -> y3=1\n  t3: S (stay at 1) -> y4=1\n  t4: U -> y5=2\n  t5: U -> y6=3\n  t6: U -> y7=4\n  t7: U -> y8=5\n  t8: U -> y9=6\n  t9: U -> y10=7\n  t10: U -> y11=8\n  t11: U -> y12=9\n\nSo total actions: 12 (from t0 to t11). H=12.\n\nBut wait, at t4 we are at y4=1 (freeway1) and we are safe. Then we start moving up.\n\nBut we have to check the next turns: \n\nAt t5: we are at y5=2 (freeway2) at absolute turn 9 (since t5: 4+5=9). \n  Freeway2 at t5: dangerous? We computed freeway2 is dangerous at t=4 and t=5? \n      t=5: [-35+6*5, -24+6*5] = [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in this interval? Yes. So dangerous.\n\nSo we cannot be on freeway2 at t5 (absolute turn9).\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeway2 at t5.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8 are all dangerous at t5.\n\nBut we are at y4=1 at t4. Then we plan to go U at t4 to y5=2 at t5 -> which is dangerous.\n\nSo we cannot do that.\n\nWe must wait at freeway1 for more turns? \n\nAt t4: we are at y4=1 (safe). Then we can do:\n\n  t4: S -> y5=1 (then at t5: absolute turn9, we are at freeway1) -> freeway1 at t5: \n        [-35+12*5, -24+12*5] = [-35+60, -24+60] = [25,36] -> safe.\n\nThen at t5: we are at y5=1. Then we can start moving up.\n\nBut we have to avoid freeways 2 to 8 at the dangerous times? The dangerous times for freeways 2-8 are t=4 and t=5. But t5 is absolute turn9? \n  Relative t=5: absolute turn 4+5=9.\n\nFor freeway2: dangerous at t=4 and t=5 (relative) -> absolute turns 8 and 9. So yes, at t=5 (absolute turn9) freeway2 is dangerous.\n\nBut we are at freeway1 at t5? That's safe.\n\nThen at t5, we choose an action: if we go U, then at t6 we would be at y6=2. But at t6: absolute turn10. \n  For freeway2 at t6 (relative t=6): \n      [-35+6*6, -24+6*6] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> safe? Because 0 is not in [1,12]. \n\nSo at t6, freeway2 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 3-8 at t6: \n  For freeway2: safe at t6? \n      We computed: at t=4 and t=5 dangerous, and at t=6: [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3: same as freeway2 -> safe at t6.\n\nSo we can move up at t5 and t6.\n\nBut we have to check the entire path.\n\nSo plan:\n\n  t0: S -> y1=3 (safe at t1: freeway3 at turn5: safe)\n  t1: D -> y2=2 (freeway2 at turn6: t=2 relative? Actually, absolute turn for t1: 4+1=5 -> freeway2 at turn5: safe? \n        at t=1 (relative) for freeway2: [-29,-18] -> safe.\n        But note: t1: we are at y2=2 at the start of turn5? Actually, the state after action t1 is y2, which is the position at the start of turn t1+1? \n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nAt the beginning of turn 4 (absolute), we are at y0=3. \nWe choose a4 (which is our a0) -> then we move to y1 at the beginning of turn5.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn5: y1 = 3 if we chose S.\n\nThen we choose a5 (a1) -> then at the beginning of turn6: y2.\n\nSo:\n\n  Absolute turn 4: y0=3 -> we choose a4 (a0) = S -> then at turn5: y1=3.\n  Absolute turn 5: we are at y1=3 -> choose a5 (a1)=D -> then at turn6: y2=2.\n\nAt turn6: we are at y2=2 -> that is freeway2 at absolute turn6 (relative t=2). \n  Freeway2 at t=2: we computed [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nThen we choose a2: D -> at turn7: y3=1.\n  Turn7: relative t=3, absolute turn7 -> freeway1: [1,12] (as computed) -> safe.\n\nThen a3: S -> at turn8: y4=1 -> safe (freeway1 at t4: [13,24]).\n\nThen a4: S -> at turn9: y5=1 -> safe (freeway1 at t5: [25,36]).\n\nThen a5: U -> at turn10: y6=2 -> freeway2 at relative t=6 (absolute turn10): \n      freeway2: [ -35+6*(10-4) = -35+36=1, -24+36=12] -> [1,12] -> safe.\n\nThen we can continue U all the way:\n\n  a6: U -> turn11: y7=3\n  a7: U -> turn12: y8=4\n  a8: U -> turn13: y9=5\n  a9: U -> turn14: y10=6\n  a10: U -> turn15: y11=7\n  a11: U -> turn16: y12=8\n  a12: U -> turn17: y13=9\n\nSo total actions: 13 (from a0 to a12). H=13.\n\nBut earlier we had a plan that went down to 0 and then up that also took 13 actions. \n\nCan we do better?\n\nWe want to minimize H. The direct path (without obstacles) is 6. But we have to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeways 2-8 at t=4 and t=5 (relative) and freeway1 at t=2.\n\nWe are starting at y=3 at t0.\n\nWe can try to go up as much as possible until we have to avoid t=4 and t=5.\n\nWe know at t=4 and t=5, we must be at y=0, y=9, or freeway1? But we cannot be at freeway1 at t=4 without being there at t=3? And we saw we can be at freeway1 at t=3 and t4 safely.\n\nBut then we have to wait at freeway1 for t4 and t5? Then at t5 we are still at freeway1. Then at t6 we can start moving up.\n\nSo the minimal might be 13? \n\nAlternatively, can we get to freeway1 earlier and then move up during the safe times?\n\nBut we have to avoid freeway1 at t2.\n\nSo we can be at freeway1 at t0? We start at 3, not 1.\n\nAt t0: we are at 3. We can go down to 2 at t1, then to 1 at t2? But at t2 we would be at freeway1 -> dangerous.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway1 at t2.\n\nTherefore, we have to be at freeway1 only at t>=3.\n\nWe can be at freeway1 at t3 and t4 and t5 safely.\n\nThen at t5, we are at freeway1. Then we move up: at t6 we are at freeway2, and freeway2 at t6 is safe (as above).\n\nSo the path we have is:\n\n  t0: stay at 3 -> safe (freeway3 at t0: turn4) -> we already computed safe.\n  t1: down to 2 -> safe (freeway2 at t1: turn5) -> safe.\n  t2: down to 1? -> but then at turn6 (absolute) we are at freeway1 -> dangerous at t2 (relative) because freeway1 at t2 is dangerous.\n\nSo we cannot do down at t2.\n\nThen what? We can at t2 not go down? \n\nAt t1 we are at 2 (freeway2). Then at t2 we can do:\n\n  Option: stay at 2? Then at t2 (absolute turn6) we are at freeway2: which is dangerous at t2? \n      freeway2 at t2 (relative t=2, absolute turn6): [-23,-12] -> safe? Yes, because 0 is not in [-23,-12]. \n      But wait, we computed freeway2 dangerous at t=4 and t=5? Here t2 is relative time 2, which is absolute turn6? \n      Our dangerous times for freeway2: t=4 and t=5 (relative) -> absolute turns 8 and 9. So at absolute turn6 (t=2) it is safe.\n\n  Then we can stay at 2 at t2.\n\n  Then at t3: we go down to 1 -> then at turn7 (absolute) we are at freeway1: [1,12] -> safe.\n\n  Then at t4: we stay at 1 -> turn8: freeway1: [13,24] -> safe.\n\n  Then at t5: we stay at 1 -> turn9: freeway1: [25,36] -> safe.\n\n  Then at t6: we go up to 2 -> turn10: freeway2: [1,12] (since t=6: -35+6*6=1, -24+36=12) -> safe.\n\n  Then continue up.\n\nSo this path:\n\n  t0: S -> y1=3 (turn5: safe)\n  t1: D -> y2=2 (turn6: safe? freeway2 at turn6 (absolute)= t1+1? Actually, after action t1 we are at y2 at the start of turn6? \n        Absolute turn5: we are at y1=3? Then we choose action at turn5: D -> then at turn6: y2=2.\n        Freeway2 at turn6: relative t=2 -> [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n  t2: S -> y3=2 (turn7: freeway2 at turn7: relative t=3: [-35+6*3, -24+6*3] = [-17,-6] -> safe? Yes, 0 not in.\n  t3: D -> y4=1 (turn8: freeway1 at turn8: [13,24] -> safe)\n  t4: S -> y5=1 (turn9: freeway1: [25,36] -> safe)\n  t5: U -> y6=2 (turn10: freeway2: [1,12] -> safe)\n  t6: U -> y7=3 (turn11)\n  t7: U -> y8=4 (turn12)\n  t8: U -> y9=5 (turn13)\n  t9: U -> y10=6 (turn14)\n  t10: U -> y11=7 (turn15)\n  t11: U -> y12=8 (turn16)\n  t12: U -> y13=9 (turn17)\n\nTotal actions: 13 (t0 to t12). Same as before.\n\nBut we used two S actions (at t0 and t2) and one D at t1 and one D at t3, then U from t5 to t12.\n\nWe can try to minimize by not staying at t0.\n\nAlternative: at t0, go up to 4? \n\n  t0: U -> y1=4 at turn5.\n  Then at turn5: freeway4 -> dangerous at t=4 and t=5? But t=1 (relative) for freeway4: [-29,-18] -> safe.\n  t1: U -> y2=5 at turn6: freeway5 at t=2: [-23,-12] -> safe.\n  t2: U -> y3=6 at turn7: freeway6 at t=3: [-17,-6] -> safe.\n  t3: now we are at 6 at turn7. We cannot go to 7 at turn8 because freeway7 is dangerous at t=4 (absolute turn8). \n        And we cannot stay at 6 (freeway6) at turn8: dangerous.\n        And we cannot go down to 5: freeway5 dangerous at turn8.\n\n  But we can go down to 5? Then at turn8 we are at freeway5: dangerous.\n\n  Or down to 7? We are at 6, so we can only go to 5,6,7.\n\n  So we must go to a safe haven. The only safe positions at turn8 (t=4) are y=0, y=9, or freeway1? But we are at 6, and we have one move: cannot get to freeway1 or 0 or 9.\n\n  Therefore, we must have planned to be in a safe position by t=4.\n\n  So we must be at y=0 or y=1 (freeway1) at t=4.\n\n  How to get from y3=6 (at t3) to y4=1 in one move? Impossible.\n\n  Or to 0: impossible.\n\n  So we cannot do that.\n\nWe could go down earlier.\n\nAnother idea: go down immediately to 0, but then we have to come up.\n\nWe did that: 4 actions to get to 0 at turn8 (by doing D,D,D,S) and then 9 actions up: total 13.\n\nOr we can go to freeway1 at turn8 by a different route.\n\nWe already have a route that takes 13 actions.\n\nBut can we do 12?\n\nSuppose we try to be at freeway1 at turn8 (t4) and then at turn9 (t5) we are still there, and then from turn10 (t6) we move up.\n\nThe move up from freeway1 (y=1) to y=9 takes 8 moves (from 1 to 9: 8 steps). And we have to get to freeway1 by t4 (which we did in 4 moves). Then we use 8 moves to go up: total 12 moves.\n\nBut we have to check if we can get to freeway1 in 4 moves without being in danger.\n\nWe start at y0=3 at turn4.\n\nWe need to be at y4=1 at turn8.\n\nWe need a sequence of 4 actions that take us from 3 to 1, without being in a dangerous position at any intermediate turn.\n\nThe dangerous positions are:\n  At turn4 (t0): we are at 3 -> safe.\n  At turn5 (t1): we are at y1 -> must be safe.\n  At turn6 (t2): we are at y2 -> must avoid freeway1 (because freeway1 is dangerous at t2) and also if we are on freeways2-8 we are safe at t2? \n        freeways2-8: dangerous only at t=4 and t=5? So at t2 (absolute turn6) they are safe.\n        But freeway1 is dangerous at t2.\n\n  At turn7 (t3): we are at y3 -> must be safe.\n\nThen at turn8 (t4): we are at y4=1 -> safe.\n\nSo we can go:\n\n  t0: D -> y1=2 (at turn5: freeway2 -> safe at t1)\n  t1: S -> y2=2 (at turn6: freeway2 -> safe at t2? freeway2 at t2 (absolute turn6): safe? yes, because dangerous only at t=4,5)\n  t2: D -> y3=1 (at turn7: freeway1 -> safe at t3? freeway1 at t3: [1,12] -> safe)\n  t3: S -> y4=1 (at turn8: safe)\n\nThat's 4 moves: D, S, D, S.\n\nNow, then we do:\n\n  t4: S -> y5=1 (at turn9: freeway1 at t5: safe) \n  t5: U -> y6=2 (at turn10: freeway2 at t6: safe) \n  then U all the way to 9.\n\nFrom y6=2 at t6 (absolute turn10) to y=9: we need 7 moves: 2->3,4,...,9: 7 steps.\n\nSo actions:\n  t0: D\n  t1: S\n  t2: D\n  t3: S -> now at y4=1 (after 4 actions)\n  t4: S -> y5=1 (5th action)\n  t5: U -> y6=2 (6th)\n  t6: U -> y7=3 (7th)\n  t7: U -> y8=4 (8th)\n  t8: U -> y9=5 (9th)\n  t9: U -> y10=6 (10th)\n  t10: U -> y11=7 (11th)\n  t11: U -> y12=8 (12th)\n  t12: U -> y13=9 (13th)\n\nAgain 13 actions.\n\nBut at t4 we are at 1. Then we do t4: S to stay at 1 for turn9. But do we need to? We can at t4 (which is the action for turn8) immediately go up? \n\nThen:\n  t4: U -> then at turn9 (absolute) we would be at y5=2. \n        But turn9: freeway2 is dangerous (at t=5: relative t=5) -> because freeway2 at t5: [-5,6] -> 0 in the interval.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nTherefore, we must stay at freeway1 at turn9 (t5) as well.\n\nSo we have to wait at freeway1 for two turns: turn8 and turn9.\n\nThen at turn10 we can move up.\n\nSo the minimal H is 13.\n\nBut let me try to be at y=9 earlier.\n\nNote that we can reach y=9 at an earlier turn? But we need 6 steps up from 3. The earliest is turn4+6 = turn10. But at turn10, we would be at y=9? \n\nTo be at y=9 at turn10, we need to be at y=9 at the start of turn10. That means we must have been at y=8 at turn9 and then moved U.\n\nBut at turn9 (absolute), if we are at freeway8 (y=8) then it is dangerous? Because freeway8 is dangerous at t=5 (relative) which is absolute turn9.\n\nSo we cannot be on freeway8 at turn9.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be on any freeway from 1 to 8 at turn9.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn10, we must be at y=8 at turn9 and then move U. But then at turn9 we are at freeway8 -> dangerous.\n\nTherefore, we cannot reach y=9 before turn11? \n\nIf we are at y=9 at turn11, then at turn10 we were at y=8. But turn10 is absolute turn10: relative t=6. Freeway8 at t=6: \n  For the car1 on freeway8: [-35+6*6, -24+6*6] = [1,12] -> safe.\n  So freeway8 at turn10 is safe.\n\nSo we can be at freeway8 at turn10.\n\nThen we can do:\n\n  ... to be at y=8 at turn10, then at turn10 we move U to y=9 at turn11.\n\nSo the earliest arrival at y=9 is at turn11.\n\nThat means we have 7 moves (from turn4 to turn10) to go from y=3 to y=8, then one move to 9, so total 8 moves? But we have to account for the waiting.\n\nWe have 7 actions (actions at turn4 to turn10) to be at y=8 at turn10.\n\nBut we start at turn4 at y=3. We need to cover 5 steps (3 to 8) in 6 moves? But we have 7 actions? \n\nThe actions are for turn4,5,6,7,8,9,10: 7 actions.\n\nWe need to go from 3 to 8: 5 steps up. So we have 7 actions to do 5 ups and 2 waits or downs.\n\nBut we must avoid the dangerous times.\n\nSpecifically, we must not be on freeways 1-8 at turn8 (absolute) and turn9 (absolute) in a dangerous way? Actually, turn8 and turn9 are dangerous for freeways 2-8, and turn6 is dangerous for freeway1.\n\nBut we are going up, so we might avoid freeway1.\n\nWe are at y=3 at turn4.\n\nWe want to be at y=8 at turn10.\n\nThe constraints:\n\n- At turn8 (absolute, relative t=4): we must not be on freeways 2-8 (because they are dangerous) and freeway1 is safe but we are going up so probably not there. So we must be at y=0 or y=9 or freeway1. But we are not at 9 yet, and freeway1 is y=1, which is below. So the only option is y=0? But we are at y=3 at turn4, and we want to be at 8 at turn10, so we are going up. Being at 0 at turn8 is not helpful.\n\n- At turn9 (absolute, t=5): similarly, we must not be on freeways2-8.\n\nSo at turn8 and turn9, we must be at y=0, y=9, or freeway1.\n\nBut we are on our way up. freeway1 is at y=1. We can try to be at freeway1 at turn8 and turn9.\n\nSo plan: be at y=1 at turn8 and turn9, then from turn10 to turn10 be at y=8? \n\nBut from y=1 at turn9 to y=8 at turn10: that's 7 steps in one move? Impossible.\n\nAlternatively, be at y=0 at turn8 and turn9, then jump to 7 at turn10? Impossible.\n\nSo the only option is to be at freeway1 at turn8 and turn9, and then move up as fast as possible.\n\nThat means:\n\n  By turn8 (after 4 actions) we must be at y=1.\n  By turn9 (after 5 actions) we must be at y=1 (waiting).\n\n  Then at turn10 (after 6 actions) we move to y=2.\n  turn11: y=3\n  turn12: y=4\n  turn13: y=5\n  turn14: y=6\n  turn15: y=7\n  turn16: y=8\n  turn17: y=9\n\nSo we reach y=9 at turn17, after 13 actions (from turn4 to turn16? Let's count:\n\n  Actions: \n    turn4: action0\n    turn5: action1\n    turn6: action2\n    turn7: action3 -> after 4 actions, we are at turn8: y=1.\n    turn8: action4: S or U? We have to be at y=1 at turn9, so if we do S at action4, then at turn9: y=1.\n    turn9: action5: U -> then at turn10: y=2.\n    turn10: action6: U -> y=3\n    turn11: action7: U -> y=4\n    turn12: action8: U -> y=5\n    turn13: action9: U -> y=6\n    turn14: action10: U -> y=7\n    turn15: action11: U -> y=8\n    turn16: action12: U -> y=9\n\n  So at the beginning of turn17, we are at y=9.\n\n  Number of actions: 13.\n\nThis is the same as before.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 13.\n\nNow, we need to output the sequence.\n\nWe can choose any safe path that takes 13 actions.\n\nOne path is:\n  action0 (turn4): D\n  action1 (turn5): S\n  action2 (turn6): D\n  action3 (turn7): S   -> after action3, at turn8: y=1.\n  action4 (turn8): S   -> at turn9: y=1.\n  action5 (turn9): U   -> at turn10: y=2.\n  action6 (turn10): U  -> y=3\n  action7: U -> y=4\n  action8: U -> y=5\n  action9: U -> y=6\n  action10: U -> y=7\n  action11: U -> y=8\n  action12: U -> y=9\n\nBut is this safe? Let's verify the positions:\n\n  Start: turn4: y=3.\n  action0 (turn4): D -> then at turn5: y=2.\n        turn5: freeway2 -> at t=1: [-29,-18] -> safe.\n  action1 (turn5): S -> at turn6: y=2.\n        turn6: freeway2 -> at t=2: [-23,-12] -> safe.\n  action2 (turn6): D -> at turn7: y=1.\n        turn7: freeway1 -> at t=3: [1,12] -> safe.\n  action3 (turn7): S -> at turn8: y=1.\n        turn8: freeway1 -> at t=4: [13,24] -> safe.\n  action4 (turn8): S -> at turn9: y=1.\n        turn9: freeway1 -> at t=5: [25,36] -> safe.\n  action5 (turn9): U -> at turn10: y=2.\n        turn10: freeway2 -> at t=6: [1,12] -> safe.\n  actions6-12: U every time, moving up to 9, and once above freeway1, the freeways we are on are safe because:\n        freeway3 at turn11: t=7 -> [-35+6*7, -24+42] = [-35+42, -24+42] = [7,18] -> safe.\n        similarly, freeways 4,5,6,7,8 at their turns will be at positions that are positive and increasing, so safe.\n\nSo this works.\n\nAnother path is the one where we go down to 0:\n\n  action0: D\n  action1: D\n  action2: D\n  action3: S  -> at turn8: y=0 (safe)\n  action4: U  -> turn9: y=1 (freeway1: safe at turn9: [25,36])\n  action5: U -> turn10: y=2 (freeway2: [1,12] safe)\n  ... and then U to 9: actions6 to action12: 7 ups.\n\nTotal actions: 12+1=13.\n\nBut at action4: from 0 to 1, then action5: to 2, etc.\n\nBut action4 is at turn8: from y=0, we go U to y=1 at turn9.\n  turn9: freeway1 -> safe.\n\nThis is also 13 actions.\n\nBut whichever, we output a sequence of 13 actions.\n\nWe can choose the first one.\n\nSo actions for turns:\n\nTurn 4: D\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: D\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n\nBut wait, the absolute turn for the last action is turn16, and we reach y=9 at the beginning of turn17.\n\nBut the problem asks for the actions from turn t1 (4) until the action that makes us reach (0,9). The last action is at turn16, which is a1 + 12? \n\nRelative t: actions from t=0 to t=12.\n\nAbsolute turns: 4,5,...,16.\n\nSo we have 13 actions.\n\nNow, let's write in the format.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: D\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: D\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n}\n\nBut wait, after the action at turn16, we are at y=9 at turn17. But the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at the last action? \n\nThe player update: after action a_t, the new position is at the next turn.\n\nWe are at turn t: position y_t.\nWe do a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta.\n\nWe want y_{t+1} = 9.\n\nIn this sequence, after the action at turn16, we have y_{17} = y_{16} + 1 = 8+1=9. So we reach at turn17.\n\nBut the last action is at turn16.\n\nThe sequence has H=13 actions: from turn4 to turn16.\n\nWe must ensure that at each turn we are safe.\n\nIn the above, we already verified.\n\nAlternatively, we can output a sequence that ends with an action at an earlier turn? But we cannot do better than 13.\n\nAnother safe sequence that might be more direct in up moves when possible, but still 13.\n\nGiven that, we output the above.\n\nBut note: in the beginning, we could have gone down to 0 faster? \n\n  action0: D (to 2)\n  action1: D (to 1) -> but then at turn6: y=1 -> dangerous! \n        Because at turn6 (absolute) for freeway1: dangerous.\n\nSo we cannot do action1: D to 1 at turn5.\n\nThat's why we had to do a wait at 2.\n\nSo the sequence we have is valid.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) is 13. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by strategically moving down, staying, and then moving up after the dangerous turns (absolute turns 8 and 9, corresponding to relative turns \\(t = 4\\) and \\(t = 5\\)) have passed. \n\nThe dangerous turns for freeways are:\n- Freeway 1 is dangerous at absolute turn 6 (relative \\(t = 2\\)).\n- Freeways 2 to 8 are dangerous at absolute turns 8 and 9 (relative \\(t = 4\\) and \\(t = 5\\)).\n\nThe sequence ensures the player is at safe positions during these dangerous turns:\n- At absolute turn 8 (relative \\(t = 4\\)), the player is at \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1, which is safe at this turn).\n- At absolute turn 9 (relative \\(t = 5\\)), the player is at \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1, safe).\n\nAfter these turns, the player moves up continuously to reach \\(y = 9\\) by absolute turn 17.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 4: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: \\text{U}\n}\n\n### Verification:\n- **Turn 4 (start):** Position \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3). Cars on freeway 3 at turn 4: span \\([-35, -24]\\), 0 not in interval → safe.\n- **Turn 5:** Action D → \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2). Cars on freeway 2 at turn 5: span \\([-29, -18]\\), 0 not in interval → safe.\n- **Turn 6:** Action S → \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2). Cars on freeway 2 at turn 6: span \\([-23, -12]\\), 0 not in interval → safe.\n- **Turn 7:** Action D → \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1). Cars on freeway 1 at turn 7: span \\([1, 12]\\), 0 not in interval → safe.\n- **Turn 8:** Action S → \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1). Cars on freeway 1 at turn 8: span \\([13, 24]\\), 0 not in interval → safe.\n- **Turn 9:** Action S → \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1). Cars on freeway 1 at turn 9: span \\([25, 36]\\), 0 not in interval → safe.\n- **Turn 10:** Action U → \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2). Cars on freeway 2 at turn 10: span \\([1, 12]\\), 0 not in interval → safe.\n- **Turn 11:** Action U → \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3). Cars on freeway 3 at turn 11: span \\([7, 18]\\), 0 not in interval → safe.\n- **Turn 12:** Action U → \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4). Cars on freeway 4 at turn 12: span \\([13, 24]\\), 0 not in interval → safe.\n- **Turn 13:** Action U → \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5). Cars on freeway 5 at turn 13: span \\([19, 30]\\), 0 not in interval → safe.\n- **Turn 14:** Action U → \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6). Cars on freeway 6 at turn 14: span \\([25, 36]\\), 0 not in interval → safe.\n- **Turn 15:** Action U → \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7). Cars on freeway 7 at turn 15: \n  - Car 1: span \\([31, 42]\\), 0 not in.\n  - Car 2: span \\([91, 102]\\), 0 not in.\n  - Car 3: span \\([121, 132]\\), 0 not in → safe.\n- **Turn 16:** Action U → \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8). Cars on freeway 8 at turn 16:\n  - Car 1: span \\([37, 48]\\), 0 not in.\n  - Car 2: span \\([97, 108]\\), 0 not in.\n  - Car 3: span \\([127, 138]\\), 0 not in → safe.\n- After action at turn 16, position is \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17, which is above freeways and safe.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in 13 turns.",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 0) at turn t1 = 8. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. Since we start at y=0 and need to get to y=9, moving down isn't useful; we should only move up or stay, but staying might be necessary to avoid cars.\n\nNow, about the cars: each freeway has cars moving left or right. For collision, it happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes with time based on speed and direction.\n\nKey point: if you move to a new y at turn T, you're not on that y until the next turn. So at turn T, you're on y_T, and you choose action to go to y_{T+1}. But for collision, at turn T, you're on y_T, so we check cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nThe collision condition is: at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8 (since freeways are y=1 to 8), and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nThe player is at x=0 always, I think? The position is (0, y), so x is fixed at 0, and we move vertically. The cars are on horizontal freeways, so they move horizontally, and we need to avoid being at y=k when a car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nGiven that, let's list the car states for each freeway at turn t1=8.\n\nFreeway k=1: one car, (head h=48, tail τ=37, direction right, speed s=12)\n\nSince direction is right, for a right-moving car, head is the front, so at time t, span is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)]? Let me see the update rule.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: span at T is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nRight-moving: span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving, it says: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for k=1, it says (48, 37, right, 12). So head=48, tail=37? But for right-moving, head should be the larger number, I think. Let's see: it says head h, tail τ, and for right-moving, span is [τ, h] at t1.\n\nIn this case, h=48, τ=37, so since h>τ, and direction right, so at t1, span is [37, 48], I think? [τ, h] = [37,48].\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [37 + 12(T-8), 48 + 12(T-8)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut collision when 0 is in the span at time T for the freeway we're on.\n\nNow for freeway 2,3,4,5,6: all have the same: (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nBut h=-48, τ=-59. Since direction right, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nThen at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-59 + 6(T-8), -48 + 6(T-8)]\n\nNow for freeway 7 and 8, multiple cars.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (-48, -59, right, 6), (-12, -23, right, 6), (24, 13, right, 6)\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nFirst, let's handle the simple freeways.\n\nThe player starts at y=0 at t=8. y=0 is not a freeway, so no collision there. Freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nTo reach y=9, which is also not a freeway, so no issue at y=9.\n\nWe need to pass through y=1 to y=8 safely.\n\nEach turn, we can move up or stay; moving down might not help since we need to go up.\n\nThe minimal number of turns should be at least 9, since we need to go from y=0 to y=9, which is 9 steps up. But we can stay sometimes to avoid cars, so H might be more than 9.\n\nBut we might move up multiple times, so H could be 9 if no cars block, but there are cars, so we need to find when it's safe to be on each freeway.\n\nSince we move one y per turn if we go up, but we can stay, so we can spend multiple turns on a y-level, but since the cars move, the spans change, so we can wait for a car to pass.\n\ny-levels: we are on a specific y at each turn.\n\nLet me denote time t starting from t1=8.\n\nAt time t=8: player at y=0.\n\nAction a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\ny_{t} is the position at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, and we choose a_t to set y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nCollision at turn t if y_t is between 1 and 8, and for freeway k=y_t, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at time t.\n\nWe need to ensure that for all t, if y_t in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, then no car on that freeway has 0 in span at time t.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway k, the times when it is safe to be there, i.e., when no car covers x=0.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, we need to sequence the actions so that when we are on a freeway y at time t, it is safe at that time.\n\nFirst, let's handle each freeway separately.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nOnly one car: (h=48, τ=37, right, s=12)\n\nAt time t, span is [37 + 12(t-8), 48 + 12(t-8)] for right-moving, as above.\n\nSet δt = t - 8, so time offset.\n\nAt time t=8+δt, span = [37 + 12δt, 48 + 12δt]\n\nWe need 0 not in [37 + 12δt, 48 + 12δt]\n\nSo, either 37 + 12δt > 0 or 48 + 12δt < 0? No.\n\n0 not in [L, R] means L > 0 or R < 0.\n\nHere L = 37 + 12δt, R = 48 + 12δt.\n\nSince L and R are both increasing, and at δt=0, L=37>0, R=48>0, so 0 is not in the interval because L>0.\n\nAs δt increases, L and R increase, so L >0 always for t>=8, so 0 is never in the span for this car on freeway 1.\n\nAt t=8, δt=0, L=37>0, R=48>0, so [37,48] does not contain 0, so safe.\n\nFor t>8, L and R larger, so definitely not contain 0. So for freeway 1, it is always safe to be there at any time t>=8.\n\nIs that right? 0 is not between 37 and 48, and it gets larger, so yes, x=0 is never covered by this car. So freeway y=1 is always safe.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2\n\nCars: (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nh=-48, τ=-59, direction right.\n\nAt t1=8, span: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt time t=8+δt, span: [τ + s δt, h + s δt] = [-59 + 6δt, -48 + 6δt]\n\nWe need 0 not in [L, R] where L = -59 + 6δt, R = -48 + 6δt\n\n0 in [L,R] if L <= 0 <= R\n\nSo we need to avoid when L <= 0 <= R\n\nL <= 0: -59 + 6δt <= 0 => 6δt <= 59 => δt <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833\n\nR >= 0: -48 + 6δt >= 0 => 6δt >= 48 => δt >= 8\n\nSo 0 in [L,R] when 8 <= δt <= 9.833\n\nSince δt integer, δt from 0 to ... but time t starts from 8, δt = t-8\n\nSo for δt = 8,9,10? Let's see:\n\nAt δt=8: L = -59 + 6*8 = -59 + 48 = -11\n\nR = -48 + 48 = 0\n\nNow, is 0 in [-11, 0]? Yes, since R=0.\n\nThe interval includes endpoints? I think so, since it says \"in the span\", and span is inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, at δt=9: L = -59 + 54 = -5? 6*9=54, L= -59+54= -5, R= -48+54=6\n\n0 is between -5 and 6, yes.\n\nAt δt=10: L= -59 +60=1, R= -48+60=12, so L=1>0, so 0 not in [1,12]\n\nAt δt=7: L= -59 +42= -17, R= -48+42= -6, both negative, so 0 not in [-17,-6]\n\nSo unsafe when δt=8,9\n\nThat is, time t=8+8=16 and t=8+9=17.\n\nt=16 and t=17.\n\nBut t=8+δt, so when δt=8, t=16; δt=9, t=17.\n\nNow for freeway 3,4,5,6: all have the same car: (-48,-59,right,6), so same as freeway 2.\n\nThe car state is identical for k=2,3,4,5,6: all have one car with same parameters.\n\nSo for each of y=2,3,4,5,6, it is unsafe only at t=16 and t=17.\n\nNow freeway 7: y=7\n\nCars: three of them.\n\nFirst car: (-48, -59, right, 6) — same as above.\n\nSecond car: (-12, -23, right, 6)\n\nThird car: (24, 13, right, 6)\n\nFor each, find when 0 is in span.\n\nFirst car: same as before, unsafe at t=16,17.\n\nBut we need for the freeway, if any car has 0 in span, it's unsafe.\n\nNow second car: (-12, -23, right, 6)\n\nAt t1=8, span: [τ, h] = [-23, -12] since h=-12, τ=-23? Head h=-12, tail τ=-23.\n\nDirection right, so span [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nAt time t=8+δt, span: [-23 + 6δt, -12 + 6δt]\n\n0 in span when L <= 0 <= R\n\nL = -23 + 6δt <= 0 => 6δt <= 23 => δt <= 23/6 ≈ 3.833\n\nR = -12 + 6δt >= 0 => 6δt >= 12 => δt >= 2\n\nSo for δt=2,3\n\nδt=2: L= -23+12= -11, R= -12+12=0, 0 in [-11,0]\n\nδt=3: L= -23+18= -5, R= -12+18=6, 0 in [-5,6]\n\nδt=4: L= -23+24=1, R= -12+24=12, L=1>0, 0 not in\n\nSo unsafe at δt=2,3 → t=10,11\n\nNow third car: (24, 13, right, 6)\n\nHead h=24, tail τ=13, direction right.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [13,24]\n\nAt t: [13 + 6δt, 24 + 6δt]\n\nL=13+6δt >=13>0, R>0, so never contains 0, always safe.\n\nSo for freeway 7, unsafe if first car or second car covers 0.\n\nFirst car unsafe at t=16,17\n\nSecond car unsafe at t=10,11\n\nThird car always safe.\n\nSo freeway 7 unsafe at t=10,11,16,17\n\nt=10,11 from second car, t=16,17 from first car.\n\nNow freeway 8: y=8\n\nSame cars as freeway 7: (-48,-59,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6)\n\nSo identical to freeway 7, unsafe at t=10,11,16,17\n\nNow freeway 1 we said always safe.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5,6 unsafe only at t=16,17\n\nBut for each, it's the same times since same car.\n\nNow, player starts at y=0 at t=8.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince we can only move up or stay, the minimal H would be 9 if we can go directly up without staying, but we need to avoid unsafe times on each y.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe always, since no freeway.\n\nThe path: we need to be at y=1 at some t, y=2 at some t, ..., up to y=8 at some t, then to y=9.\n\nFor each freeway y=k, we need to be there at a time when it is safe.\n\nMoreover, since we move sequentially, we go from y to y+1, so the times must be consecutive for moving up.\n\nLet me denote the time when we are at y=1, y=2, etc.\n\nSince we start at t=8, y=0.\n\nThen at each turn, we choose to stay or move up.\n\nIf we move up at turn t, then y_{t+1} = y_t +1\n\nIf stay, y_{t+1} = y_t\n\nWe need y_H =9 for some H.\n\nThe first time we reach y=9.\n\nTo minimize H, we should move up as much as possible, but avoid being on unsafe y at unsafe times.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe times for each y:\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: unsafe at t=16,17\n\ny=3: same, unsafe at t=16,17\n\ny=4: same\n\ny=5: same\n\ny=6: same\n\ny=7: unsafe at t=10,11,16,17\n\ny=8: unsafe at t=10,11,16,17\n\ny=7 and y=8 have additional unsafe times at t=10,11.\n\nNow, we start at t=8, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=1, which is always safe.\n\nThen to y=2, which is safe except t=16,17.\n\nSimilarly for y=3 to 6.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 have unsafe times at t=10,11 and 16,17.\n\nSince we need to go through all y from 0 to 9, and we start at t=8.\n\nThe minimal time to reach y=9 is if we move up every turn: from t=8, y=0, then at t=9, y=1; t=10, y=2; t=11, y=3; ... up to t=16, y=8; then t=17, y=9.\n\nBut let's check if this is safe.\n\nAt each turn, we need to check the y at that time.\n\nt=8: y=0, safe.\n\nt=9: if we move to y=1 at t=9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nAfter action, y_{t+1}.\n\nStart: t=8, y=0.\n\nWe choose action a_8, which sets y_9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSuppose we always move up: so a_t = U for t from 8 onwards.\n\nThen:\n\nAt t=8: y=0 (safe)\n\na_8 = U → y_9 =1\n\nt=9: y=1 (freeway, but safe as we saw)\n\nNow, at t=9, we are on y=1, which is safe.\n\nThen a_9 = U → y_10 =2\n\nt=10: y=2\n\ny=2 is freeway, unsafe at t=16,17? But t=10 is not 16 or 17, so for y=2, unsafe only at t=16,17, so at t=10, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 unsafe only at t=16,17, so at t=10, safe.\n\nThen t=10: y=2, safe? y=2 unsafe only at t=16,17, so yes, at t=10, safe.\n\nThen a_10 = U → y_11 =3\n\nt=11: y=3, similarly, y=3 unsafe only at t=16,17, so at t=11, safe.\n\nThen a_11 = U → y_12 =4\n\nt=12: y=4, safe (only unsafe at 16,17)\n\na_12 = U → y_13 =5\n\nt=13: y=5, safe\n\na_13 = U → y_14 =6\n\nt=14: y=6, safe (unsafe at 16,17, but t=14<16)\n\na_14 = U → y_15 =7\n\nt=15: y=7\n\nNow y=7 is unsafe at t=10,11,16,17\n\nt=15: not 10,11,16,17? 15 is not in {10,11,16,17}, so should be safe?\n\ny=7 unsafe times: t=10,11,16,17\n\nt=15 not in, so safe.\n\nThen a_15 = U → y_16 =8\n\nt=16: y=8\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=10,11,16,17\n\nt=16 is unsafe.\n\nProblem: at t=16, y=8, which is unsafe because of the cars.\n\nSpecifically, for y=8, at t=16, which is unsafe.\n\nThen we would collide.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=8 at t=16, unsafe.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=16, y=8, unsafe.\n\nThen a_16 = U → y_17=9, but at t=16 we are on y=8, collide.\n\nEven if we don't move, but we need to move up eventually.\n\nBut at t=16, y=8, we are on the freeway and it's unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=8 at t=16.\n\nSimilarly, at t=17, y=8 would also be unsafe.\n\nIn the sequence above, we are at y=8 at t=16.\n\nBut we need to avoid that.\n\nWe could stay at some point to delay.\n\nFor example, at t=15, we are at y=7, which is safe at t=15.\n\nInstead of moving up to y=8 at t=16, we could stay at y=7 for one turn.\n\nThen at t=16, if we stay, y=7 still.\n\nt=16: y=7, but y=7 is unsafe at t=16? Yes, t=16 is unsafe for y=7.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=16,17.\n\nSo at t=16, if we are on y=7, also unsafe.\n\nIn fact, both y=7 and y=8 are unsafe at t=16 and t=17.\n\nSo we need to not be on y=7 or y=8 at t=16 or t=17.\n\nAlso, at t=10 and t=11, y=7 and y=8 are unsafe, but in our path, we were at y=2 and y=3 at t=10,11, which are safe.\n\nThe problem is at t=16,17 for y=7 and y=8.\n\nWe need to pass through y=7 and y=8 at times not 10,11,16,17.\n\nSince we are moving up, we can only be at each y for one turn if we move up continuously, but we can stay to be at a y for multiple turns.\n\nFor example, we can stay at a safe y to wait until the unsafe time passes.\n\nNow, the unsafe times for y=7 and y=8 are t=10,11,16,17.\n\nt=10 and 11 are early, but we are not there yet at t=10,11 since we start from t=8.\n\nIn the direct path, at t=10 we are at y=2, not y=7.\n\nSo t=10,11 are not issue for us.\n\nThe issue is t=16,17 for y=7 and y=8.\n\nWe need to be on y=7 at some t not 16 or 17, and y=8 at some t not 16 or 17.\n\nAlso, for y=2 to y=6, they are only unsafe at t=16,17, so we need to not be on them at t=16,17.\n\nBut since we need to go through all, and y=7 and y=8 have more constraints.\n\nNow, let's list the safe times for each y.\n\ny=1: always safe, any t\n\ny=2: safe for t not 16,17, i.e., t<=15 or t>=18\n\nSimilarly y=3,4,5,6: same, safe except t=16,17\n\ny=7: safe except t=10,11,16,17. So safe for t=8,9,12,13,14,15,18,19,... but t starts from 8.\n\nt=8,9,12,13,14,15,18,...\n\ny=8: same, safe except t=10,11,16,17\n\nWe start at t=8, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe sequence of y over time.\n\nSince we can move up or stay, the time to increase y by one can vary.\n\nTo minimize H, we should move up as soon as possible, but delay only when necessary to avoid unsafe times.\n\nIn this case, the unsafe times are at t=16,17 for multiple y, and we need to pass y=7 and y=8 before or after these times.\n\nt=16,17 are late times.\n\nSince we start at t=8, we can go up quickly to y=7 before t=16.\n\nBut y=7 is unsafe at t=10,11,16,17, but t=10,11 are early, we can be at y=7 at t=12 to 15, for example.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at t=12 to 15 or after 17.\n\nBut after 17 might be later.\n\nNow, let's see the earliest we can reach each y.\n\nIf no cars, we can be at y=1 at t=9, y=2 at t=10, ..., y=8 at t=16, y=9 at t=17.\n\nBut at t=16, y=8 is unsafe, and if we are at y=7 at t=15, it might be safe or not.\n\nt=15: y=7 is safe? y=7 safe at t=15, yes, as per above.\n\nBut if we move to y=8 at t=16, y=8 unsafe.\n\nSo we need to be at y=8 at a different time.\n\nFor example, we can reach y=7 earlier, and then go to y=8 earlier.\n\nBut how early can we reach y=7?\n\nStart: t=8, y=0\n\nAfter action, y_9.\n\nSuppose we move up every turn:\n\na_8=U: y_9=1 at t=9\n\na_9=U: y_10=2 at t=10\n\na_10=U: y_11=3 at t=11\n\na_11=U: y_12=4 at t=12\n\na_12=U: y_13=5 at t=13\n\na_13=U: y_14=6 at t=14\n\na_14=U: y_15=7 at t=15\n\nNow at t=15, y=7, which is safe.\n\nNow, from here, we can move to y=8 at t=16, but t=16 y=8 unsafe.\n\nWe can stay at y=7 at t=16, but y=7 at t=16 is unsafe, because t=16 is unsafe for y=7.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=16,17.\n\nSo at t=16, if we are at y=7, we collide.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay at y=6, but we are at y=7 at t=15.\n\nOptions at t=15: we are at y=7, safe.\n\nWe choose a_15.\n\nIf a_15=U, then y_16=8, but at t=16, y=8, unsafe.\n\nIf a_15=S, then y_16=7, and at t=16, y=7, but unsafe at t=16, collide.\n\nIf we go down, but that might not help, and y=6 at t=16: y=6 is unsafe at t=16,17? y=6 unsafe only at t=16,17.\n\nSo at t=16, y=6 also unsafe.\n\nIn fact, all y=2 to 8 are unsafe at t=16,17 except y=1, but we are past that.\n\ny=1 is safe, but we are at y=7.\n\nSo at t=16, whatever y from 2 to 8 we are on, it will be unsafe, except if we are on y=0 or y=9, but we are not.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, but we are in between.\n\nSpecifically, for t=16 and t=17, all freeways from 2 to 8 are unsafe because:\n\ny=2 to 6: unsafe at t=16,17\n\ny=7 and 8: also unsafe at t=16,17\n\nSo at t=16 and t=17, it is impossible to be on any freeway y=2 to 8 without collision.\n\nTherefore, we must not be on any freeway at t=16 or t=17.\n\nThat means, at t=16 and t=17, we must be at y=0 or y=9.\n\nBut y=0 is the start, and we need to go to y=9, so probably we should be at y=9 by t=16 or earlier, or if not, stay at y=0 until after, but we start at y=0 t=8, and need to go up.\n\nSince we start at t=8, we can reach y=9 before t=16.\n\nMinimal time to y=9 is 9 turns: from t=8 to t=16, y from 0 to 8, then t=17 y=9, but at t=16 we are at y=8, which is unsafe.\n\nIf we can reach y=9 by t=16.\n\nt=16 y=9: to be at y=9 at turn t, that means at that turn, we are on y=9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn t, we must have been at y=8 at turn t-1, and moved up.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at t=16, we need to be at y=8 at t=15, and move up at t=15.\n\nBut at t=15, if we are at y=8, and move up, then at t=16, y=9, safe.\n\nBut can we be at y=8 at t=15?\n\nt=15, y=8.\n\nNow, y=8 is safe at t=15? y=8 unsafe at t=10,11,16,17, so at t=15, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at t=15, we need to be at y=7 at t=14, and move up at t=14.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nLet's see if we can reach y=8 by t=15.\n\nStart: t=8, y=0\n\nMove up: a_8=U → y_9=1 at t=9\n\na_9=U → y_10=2 at t=10\n\na_10=U → y_11=3 at t=11\n\na_11=U → y_12=4 at t=12\n\na_12=U → y_13=5 at t=13\n\na_13=U → y_14=6 at t=14\n\na_14=U → y_15=7 at t=15? At t=14, y=6, then a_14=U → y_15=7\n\ny_15=7 at t=15.\n\nWe need y=8 at t=15? No, to be at y=8 at time t, we need to have moved to it.\n\nAt t=15, we can be at y=7.\n\nThen from there, to reach y=8 at some time.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=16, we need to be at y=8 at t=15, and a_15=U.\n\nBut at t=15, we are at y=7, not y=8.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=8 at t=15 if we are at y=7 at t=15.\n\nSequence:\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action, y_{t+1}.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=14: suppose y_14=6\n\nThen a_14: if U, y_15=7\n\nThen at t=15, y=7\n\nThen a_15: if U, y_16=8\n\nBut at t=16, y=8, unsafe.\n\nIf at t=15, a_15=S, y_16=7, then at t=16, y=7, unsafe.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=15, we need y_15=8.\n\ny_15=8 means that at turn t=15, we are on y=8.\n\nTo be there, we must have been at y=7 or y=9 or y=8 at t=14, but since we move sequentially, probably from y=7 at t=14, move up to y=8 at t=15.\n\nSo at t=14, y=7, then a_14=U → y_15=8\n\nThen at t=15, y=8.\n\nNow, y=8 at t=15: is it safe? t=15, y=8 unsafe at t=10,11,16,17, not 15, so yes, safe.\n\nThen a_15=U → y_16=9\n\nThen at t=16, y=9, safe (not freeway).\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at t=15, we need to be at y=7 at t=14.\n\ny=7 at t=14: safe? y=7 unsafe at t=10,11,16,17, t=14 not in, so safe.\n\nNow, can we reach y=7 at t=14?\n\nFrom start: t=8, y=0\n\na_8=U → y_9=1 (t=9)\n\na_9=U → y_10=2 (t=10)\n\na_10=U → y_11=3 (t=11)\n\na_11=U → y_12=4 (t=12)\n\na_12=U → y_13=5 (t=13)\n\na_13=U → y_14=6 (t=14? At t=13, y=5, a_13=U → y_14=6\n\ny_14=6 at t=14.\n\nWe need y=7 at t=14, so we must have been at y=6 at t=13, and move up? At t=13, if y=6, then a_13=U → y_14=7\n\nBut at t=13, y=6.\n\nLet's list positions:\n\nt=8: y=0\n\na_8=U → t=9: y=1\n\na_9=U → t=10: y=2\n\na_10=U → t=11: y=3\n\na_11=U → t=12: y=4\n\na_12=U → t=13: y=5\n\nNow at t=13, y=5\n\na_13=U → y_14=6\n\nThen t=14: y=6\n\nBut we need to be at y=7 at t=14? No, at t=14 we are at y=6 if we moved up from y=5.\n\nTo have y=7 at t=14, we need to have moved up earlier.\n\nFor example, if at t=12, we were at y=5? t=12: y=4 from above.\n\nSet the time we reach each y.\n\nThe first time we can be at y=1 is t=9\n\ny=2 at t=10\n\ny=3 at t=11\n\ny=4 at t=12\n\ny=5 at t=13\n\ny=6 at t=14\n\ny=7 at t=15\n\ny=8 at t=16\n\ny=9 at t=17\n\nBut y=8 at t=16 unsafe.\n\nTo have y=7 at t=14, we need to be at y=6 at t=13, but from above, at t=13 we are at y=5 if we start moving up.\n\nWe can move faster? But we start at y=0 t=8, and each move up takes one turn, so y=k at t=8+k.\n\ny=0 at t=8, y=1 at t=9, ..., y=7 at t=15, etc.\n\nSo we cannot reach y=7 before t=15 with moving up every turn.\n\nt=8: y=0\n\nAfter one move: t=9, y=1\n\nAfter two: t=10, y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter six moves: t=14, y=6\n\nAfter seven moves: t=15, y=7\n\nAfter eight moves: t=16, y=8\n\nAfter nine moves: t=17, y=9\n\nSo y=7 at t=15 earliest.\n\ny=8 at t=16.\n\nBut at t=16, y=8 unsafe.\n\nWe need to be at y=8 before t=16 or after t=17.\n\nAfter t=17, but that would be later, H larger.\n\nBefore: can we reach y=8 earlier? Impossible, since t=15 we can be at y=7.\n\nUnless we start earlier, but t=8 is fixed.\n\nAnother idea: we can stay at some y to wait, but that would make us later.\n\nFor example, we can stay at y=0 for some turns, but that delays everything.\n\nOr stay at a safe y.\n\nBut since we need to avoid t=16 and t=17 for all freeways, we can aim to be at y=9 by t=15 or earlier.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=15, we need y=8 at t=14, and so on.\n\ny=9 at t=15: need to be at y=8 at t=14, and move up at t=14.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=14, need y=7 at t=13, etc.\n\ny=8 at t=14: need from y=7 at t=13, move up.\n\ny=7 at t=13: need from y=6 at t=12, move up.\n\n...\n\ny=1 at t=8? t=8 we are at y=0.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 by t=14.\n\nEarliest y=8 is t=16, as above.\n\nWe can stay at lower y to wait until after t=17.\n\nFor example, we can progress to y=6, which is safe until t=15, then at t=15 we are at y=6, which is safe at t=15 (since unsafe only t=16,17), then at t=16, if we are at y=6, it is unsafe, so we cannot stay.\n\nWe need to be at y=0 or y=9 at t=16 and t=17.\n\nBut y=0 is behind, so we should reach y=9 by t=16.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=16, we need to be at y=8 at t=15, and move up at t=15.\n\nCan we be at y=8 at t=15?\n\nFrom above, to be at y=8 at t=15, we need to be at y=7 at t=14, and move up at t=14.\n\ny=7 at t=14: need from y=6 at t=13, move up at t=13.\n\ny=6 at t=13: from y=5 at t=12, move up.\n\ny=5 at t=12: from y=4 at t=11, move up.\n\ny=4 at t=11: from y=3 at t=10, move up.\n\ny=3 at t=10: from y=2 at t=9, move up.\n\ny=2 at t=9: from y=1 at t=8, move up.\n\nBut at t=8, we are at y=0, not y=1.\n\nSo to have y=1 at t=8, impossible, since at t=8 we start at y=0.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=1 is t=9.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=8 before t=16.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be at y=9 before t=17.\n\nSo we must be at some freeway at t=16 or t=17, but all freeways are unsafe at t=16 and t=17.\n\nIs that true?\n\ny=1 is always safe, but we are at higher y.\n\nAt t=16, if we are at y=1, it is safe, but we need to be at y=9, so we are behind.\n\nBut we can be at y=1 at t=16, but that means we stayed low, then we have to go up later, H larger.\n\nBut to minimize H, we should go as fast as possible except when blocked.\n\nBut in this case, since t=16 and t=17 are bad for all, we need to avoid being on freeways at those times.\n\nSo one way is to be below y=1 or above y=8 at t=16 and t=17.\n\ny=0 or y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=0 t=8, we can stay at y=0 for several turns, but that delays.\n\nOr, we can reach y=9 before t=16, but impossible as above.\n\nAnother idea: we can move up to y=7 by t=15, then at t=15, since y=7 is safe at t=15, we can stay there, but at t=16, y=7 is unsafe, so we cannot stay.\n\nSimilarly, we can go to y=8 at t=15, but we can only reach y=8 at t=16, not t=15.\n\nLet's list the possible times to be at each y safely.\n\nFor y=7: can be at t=12,13,14,15,18,... but t=12 to 15 are possible.\n\nSimilarly y=8: t=12,13,14,15,18,...\n\nFor y=6: can be at t=8 to 15 or t=18+, but t=8 to 15 except we start from t=8 y=0.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly, we can be at y=7 at t=15, then to y=8 at t=16, but t=16 y=8 unsafe.\n\nOr, at t=15 y=7, we can move to y=8 at t=16, but unsafe.\n\nWe can be at y=7 at an earlier time, but how?\n\nFor example, if we move up continuously, we reach y=7 at t=15.\n\nIf we want to be at y=7 at t=14, we need to have moved faster, but we can't, since each step takes a turn.\n\nUnless we start from negative time, but no.\n\nSo the only way is to be at y=7 at t=15, then we have to deal with t=16.\n\nBut at t=16, we cannot be on y=7 or y=8 or any freeway.\n\nSo perhaps we can go to y=8 at t=15? Impossible.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps at t=15, we are at y=7, and instead of moving up, we move down to y=6, but at t=16, y=6 is unsafe, and we are going away from goal.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo the only option is to delay our progress so that we are not on freeways at t=16 and t=17.\n\nFor example, we can stay at y=0 for 8 turns, until t=16, then start moving up.\n\nBut at t=16, y=0, safe, then a_16=U to y=1 at t=17.\n\nt=17, y=1, safe.\n\nThen a_17=U to y=2 at t=18.\n\nBut at t=18, y=2, which is safe since t=18>17.\n\nThen continue up to y=9 at t=26, for example, but H is large, 18 turns from t=8 to t=25 for y=9? Let's calculate.\n\nt=8: y=0\n\nStay for 8 turns: from t=8 to t=15, stay at y=0, so actions S from t=8 to t=15.\n\nThen at t=16: y=0, a_16=U → y_17=1\n\nt=17: y=1, a_17=U → y_18=2\n\nt=18: y=2, a_18=U → y_19=3\n\n...\nup to a_24=U → y_25=9\n\nSo at t=25, y=9.\n\nH = 25 - 8 +1 = 18 turns? From t=8 to t=25 inclusive is 18 turns.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nSince y=1 is always safe, we can move to y=1 early and stay there during the bad times.\n\nFor example, move to y=1 at t=9, then stay at y=1 from t=9 to t=17, for example.\n\nAt t=9 to t=17, y=1, which is always safe.\n\nThen at t=17, we are at y=1, then start moving up.\n\nBut at t=17, y=1, safe.\n\na_17=U → y_18=2\n\nt=18: y=2, safe (t=18>17)\n\na_18=U → y_19=3\n\n...\na_24=U → y_25=9 at t=25.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut we can start moving earlier.\n\nAfter staying at y=1, at t=18 we go to y=2, etc.\n\nBut we can reach higher y before t=16.\n\nFor example, we can go up to y=6 by t=14, then at t=14, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=15, we can stay at y=6 or move to y=7.\n\nBut at t=15, y=6 is safe, y=7 is safe.\n\nIf we move to y=7 at t=15, then at t=16, we have problem.\n\nBut if at t=15, we stay at y=6, then at t=16, y=6 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at y=7 at t=15, and stay, at t=16 y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be on any freeway at t=16.\n\nTherefore, the only safe places at t=16 are y=0 or y=9.\n\nSimilarly for t=17.\n\nSince we can't reach y=9 by t=16, we must be at y=0 at t=16.\n\nThen at t=17, we can be at y=0 or move to y=1.\n\nBut to progress, at t=16, we are at y=0, then we can move up.\n\nBut at t=16, if we are at y=0, safe.\n\nThen a_16=U → y_17=1\n\nAt t=17, y=1, which is safe, as y=1 always safe.\n\nThen from there, we can move up.\n\nSo we need to be at y=0 at t=16.\n\nWe start at y=0 t=8, so we can stay at y=0 from t=8 to t=16.\n\nThen at t=16, y=0, a_16=U → y_17=1\n\nt=17: y=1, a_17=U → y_18=2\n\nt=18: y=2, a_18=U → y_19=3\n\nt=19: y=3, a_19=U → y_20=4\n\nt=20: y=4, a_20=U → y_21=5\n\nt=21: y=5, a_21=U → y_22=6\n\nt=22: y=6, a_22=U → y_23=7\n\nt=23: y=7, now y=7 safe at t=23? t=23 not 10,11,16,17, so yes.\n\na_23=U → y_24=8\n\nt=24: y=8, safe similarly.\n\na_24=U → y_25=9\n\nSo we reach y=9 at t=25.\n\nH=18 turns from t=8 to t=25.\n\nBut this is not minimal, because we wasted time staying at y=0.\n\nWe can move up to a safe y and stay there during the bad times.\n\nFor example, move to y=1 quickly and stay there.\n\nFrom t=8, a_8=U → t=9 y=1\n\nThen stay at y=1 from t=9 to t=17: so actions S from t=9 to t=16, so that at t=17, y=1.\n\nLet's see:\n\nAt t=9: y=1 (after a_8=U)\n\nThen a_9=S → y_10=1\n\nt=10: y=1, safe\n\na_10=S → y_11=1\n\n...\nup to a_16=S → y_17=1\n\nAt t=17, y=1, safe.\n\nThen a_17=U → y_18=2\n\nt=18: y=2, safe\n\na_18=U → y_19=3\n\n...\na_24=U → y_25=9 same as before.\n\nBut at t=17, we are at y=1, then move up.\n\nWe can stay less time at y=1.\n\nThe bad times are only t=16 and t=17 for the lower freeways, but for y=7 and 8, also bad at t=10,11, but we are not there.\n\nSo we can move up to y=6 by t=14, for example.\n\nThen at t=14, y=6, which is safe at t=14 (unsafe only 16,17)\n\nThen we need to stay at y=6 during t=15,16,17? But at t=16 and t=17, y=6 is unsafe, so we cannot be on y=6 at t=16 or t=17.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay at y=6, at t=15, y=6 safe, but at t=16, if we stay, y=6 unsafe.\n\nSo we must leave y=6 before t=16 or go down, but not good.\n\nSo the only safe y during t=16 and t=17 are y=0,1,9.\n\ny=1 is safe, as we said.\n\nSo we can be at y=1 at t=16 and t=17.\n\nSimilarly, we can be at higher safe y, but y=1 is the only freeway that is safe at all times.\n\ny=1 is always safe, as we established.\n\nOther y are unsafe at some times.\n\nSo to minimize time, we should move to y=1 as soon as possible, then stay at y=1 during t=16 and t=17, then after that move up quickly.\n\nBut we can move to y=6 before, then at t=15, move down to y=5 or something, but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet's calculate the minimal H.\n\nFirst, to reach y=1: at t=9.\n\nThen we can stay at y=1 until t=17.\n\nThen from t=17, y=1, move up each turn to y=9 at t=25, as before.\n\nBut we can start moving up before t=17, but we need to be at y=1 at t=16 and t=17.\n\nFor example, at t=15, we can be at y=1, then stay at t=16.\n\nBut to be at y=1 at t=15, we can have arrived earlier.\n\nSince y=1 is safe, we can be there any time.\n\nSo to save time, we can move up to a higher y before t=16, but not too high, so that we can go back to y=1 at t=16.\n\nBut going back down is counterproductive.\n\nFor example, at t=14, we can be at y=6, then at t=15, move down to y=5, but at t=15 y=5 safe, then at t=16, if we move down to y=4, but y=4 at t=16 unsafe, or to y=5, but y=5 at t=16 unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=2 to 8 at t=16 or t=17.\n\nSo the only choices are to be at y=0, y=1, or y=9 at t=16 and t=17.\n\nSince we can't be at y=9, we must be at y=0 or y=1.\n\nTo minimize H, we should be at y=1 at t=16 and t=17, then move up from there.\n\nSo we need to reach y=1 by some time, and stay there from that time until t=17.\n\nThe earliest we can reach y=1 is t=9.\n\nSo we can be at y=1 from t=9 to t=17.\n\nThen at t=17, we are at y=1, move up to y=2 at t=18, etc.\n\nBut we can reach y=1 at t=9, and stay until t=17, but at t=17 we move up, so we stay from t=9 to t=16 at y=1, then at t=17 move up.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=8: y=0, a_8=U → y_9=1\n\nt=9: y=1, a_9=S → y_10=1\n\nt=10: y=1, a_10=S → y_11=1\n\nt=11: y=1, a_11=S → y_12=1\n\nt=12: y=1, a_12=S → y_13=1\n\nt=13: y=1, a_13=S → y_14=1\n\nt=14: y=1, a_14=S → y_15=1\n\nt=15: y=1, a_15=S → y_16=1\n\nt=16: y=1, safe, a_16=S → y_17=1  (since we need to be at y=1 at t=17 for safety? At t=16, we are at y=1, safe. Then a_16, if we stay, y_17=1, then at t=17, y=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=17, we can move up.\n\na_16 could be U to go to y=2 at t=17, but at t=17, if we go to y=2, y=2 is unsafe at t=17, so we cannot.\n\nSo we must stay at y=1 at t=17 as well.\n\nThen after that, move up.\n\nSo:\n\nt=16: y=1, a_16=S → y_17=1\n\nt=17: y=1, a_17=U → y_18=2\n\nt=18: y=2, a_18=U → y_19=3\n\nt=19: y=3, a_19=U → y_20=4\n\nt=20: y=4, a_20=U → y_21=5\n\nt=21: y=5, a_21=U → y_22=6\n\nt=22: y=6, a_22=U → y_23=7\n\nt=23: y=7, a_23=U → y_24=8\n\nt=24: y=8, a_24=U → y_25=9\n\nReach y=9 at t=25.\n\nH=18 turns.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWe can move up to y=6 before t=16, then at t=15, move down to y=5, but at t=16, y=5 is unsafe, so not good.\n\nOr, we can be at y=7 at t=15, which is safe, then at t=15, instead of staying or moving up, we move down to y=6, but at t=16, y=6 unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps for y=7 and y=8, since they have safe times at t=12-15, we can be there earlier, but we can't reach earlier than t=15 for y=7.\n\nUnless we start moving faster, but we can't.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps we can skip some y or something, but no, we have to go through each y sequentially.\n\nOr, we can stay at some y to wait for the safe time for higher y.\n\nFor example, for y=7, it is safe at t=12-15, but we can only reach it at t=15, which is safe.\n\nBut then we have the t=16 problem.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=7 at t=15, then since y=8 is safe at t=15, but we can't be at y=8 at t=15.\n\nAt t=15, we are at y=7, we can move to y=8 at t=16, but t=16 unsafe.\n\nIf we could be at y=8 at t=15, but impossible.\n\nSo I think the only way is to avoid the freeways at t=16 and t=17 by being at y=1 or y=0.\n\nTo minimize H, we should be at y=1 during t=16 and t=17, and move up as fast as possible before and after.\n\nBefore t=16, we can move up to y=6, for example.\n\nLet's see the earliest we can be at y=6.\n\nStart: t=8 y=0\n\na8=U: t9 y1\n\na9=U: t10 y2\n\na10=U: t11 y3\n\na11=U: t12 y4\n\na12=U: t13 y5\n\na13=U: t14 y6\n\nSo at t=14, y=6, safe.\n\nNow at t=14, we can stay or move up.\n\nIf we move up to y=7 at t=15, y=7 safe at t=15.\n\nBut then at t=15, y=7, we need to go to y=8, but at t=16 it will be unsafe.\n\nInstead, at t=14, y=6, we can move down to y=5 at t=15, but then at t=15 y=5 safe, but at t=16 if we are at y=5, unsafe.\n\nOr, at t=14, we move down to y=5, but that seems worse.\n\nSo better to stay at y=6 until we can go to y=1, but we can't go directly.\n\nFrom y=6, to go to y=1, we need to move down multiple times, which is bad.\n\nSo the best is to go to y=1 before t=16.\n\nFor example, at t=14, y=6, we can move down repeatedly to reach y=1 by t=16.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nAt t=14, y=6\n\na14=D → y15=5\n\nt=15: y=5, a15=D → y16=4\n\nt=16: y=4, but y=4 at t=16 unsafe, collide.\n\nIf at t=15, a15=D to y16=4, but t=16 y=4 unsafe.\n\nTo be at y=1 at t=16, we need to be at y=1 at that turn.\n\nFrom t=14 y=6, we can move down: a14=D → y15=5\n\na15=D → y16=4, but at t=16 y=4 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nFrom earlier, at t=13, y=5, we can move down to y=1.\n\nt=13: y=5\n\na13=D → y14=4\n\na14=D → y15=3\n\na15=D → y16=2\n\nt=16: y=2, unsafe at t=16.\n\nStill unsafe.\n\nTo be at y=1 at t=16, we need to be at y=1 at t=15 or t=16 with move.\n\nFor example, at t=15, y=1, then a15=S → y16=1\n\nOr at t=15 y=2, a15=D → y16=1, but at t=16 y=1 safe.\n\nBut to be at y=1 at t=15, we can be there earlier.\n\nSo the most efficient is to move to y=1 at t=9, then stay there until t=17, as before.\n\nThen move up.\n\nH=18 turns.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach earlier by being at higher y before.\n\nSuppose we move to y=5 at t=13, for example.\n\nt=13 y=5, safe.\n\nThen we can stay at y=5 from t=13 to t=15, but at t=16, if we stay, y=5 unsafe.\n\nSo at t=15, we need to move to a safe y for t=16.\n\nBut the only safe y for t=16 are y=0,1,9.\n\nFrom y=5, we can move down to y=4, but y=4 unsafe at t=16.\n\nOr to y=6, same.\n\nSo we cannot reach y=1 from y=5 in one step.\n\nTo reach y=1 from y=5, it takes 4 steps down, but during that, at t=16, we might be at unsafe y.\n\nFor example, at t=13 y=5\n\na13=D → y14=4\n\nt=14 y=4, a14=D → y15=3\n\nt=15 y=3, a15=D → y16=2\n\nt=16 y=2, unsafe.\n\nOr if we go slower, but worse.\n\nSo indeed, the only safe way is to be at y=1 (or y=0) during t=16 and t=17.\n\nSince y=1 is closer, we should be at y=1.\n\nSo minimal H is 18, with the sequence as above.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nFrom t=8 to t=16, we need to be at y=1 at t=16 and t=17.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t=8: at y=0, action U to go to y=1 at t=9.\n\nThen from t=9 to t=16, we stay at y=1, so actions S at t=9 to t=15, and at t=16 action S to stay at y=1 for t=17? Let's see the actions.\n\nAt turn t, we choose action for the next position.\n\nTurn t=8: position y=0, choose a_8. To go to y=1, a_8=U.\n\nThen turn t=9: position y=1, choose a_9. To stay at y=1, a_9=S.\n\nSimilarly, a_t=S for t=9 to t=16, so that at each turn, we are at y=1 from t=9 to t=17? Let's clarify.\n\nAfter action at t, we set y_{t+1}.\n\nSo:\n\n- At turn t=8: y=0, choose a_8=U, so y_9=1\n\n- Turn t=9: y=1, choose a_9=S, so y_10=1\n\n- Turn t=10: y=1, choose a_10=S, so y_11=1\n\n- ...\n- Turn t=15: y=1, choose a_15=S, so y_16=1\n\n- Turn t=16: y=1, choose a_16=S, so y_17=1\n\n- Turn t=17: y=1, choose a_17=U, so y_18=2\n\n- Turn t=18: y=2, a_18=U, y_19=3\n\n- Turn t=19: y=3, a_19=U, y_20=4\n\n- Turn t=20: y=4, a_20=U, y_21=5\n\n- Turn t=21: y=5, a_21=U, y_22=6\n\n- Turn t=22: y=6, a_22=U, y_23=7\n\n- Turn t=23: y=7, a_23=U, y_24=8\n\n- Turn t=24: y=8, a_24=U, y_25=9\n\nAt turn t=25, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nH=18 actions from t=8 to t=25? t from t=8 to t=24 inclusive for actions, and position at t=25 is y=9.\n\nNumber of turns: from t=8 to t=24, that's 17 actions? Let's index.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=8 to t=24 for H=17 actions? But we reach at t=25.\n\nThe position at time t after actions.\n\nStart at t=8, y=0.\n\nAfter H turns, at time t_1 + H, position.\n\nt_1 =8, after H turns, at time 8+H.\n\nWe want y_{8+H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at time t=25, y=9, so 8 + H =25, thus H=17.\n\nActions from t=8 to t=24, that's 17 actions.\n\nt=8,9,10,...,24 is 17 turns.\n\nYes.\n\nWith this, we avoid all unsafe times.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose we move up to y=6 at t=14, then at t=14, instead of staying, we move down to y=5, but that doesn't help.\n\nOr, we can be at y=7 at t=15, which is safe, then at t=15, move down to y=6, but at t=16, y=6 unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps for the higher freeways, since they have safe times at t=12-15, but we can't utilize them because of the t=16 issue.\n\nAnother thought: at t=17, if we can be at y=9, but we can't reach by t=17.\n\nEarliest at t=17 y=9 requires y=8 at t=16, unsafe.\n\nSo impossible to reach by t=17.\n\nThus, minimal H is 17.\n\nBut in the sequence above, H=17 actions, reaching at t=25.\n\nBut let's see if we can start moving up earlier after the bad times.\n\nFor example, at t=17, we are at y=1, we move up to y=2 at t=18, etc.\n\nBut we can be at a higher y at t=17.\n\nFor example, if at t=17 we are at y=1, but we could be at y=6 at t=17, but y=6 at t=17 is unsafe, so we cannot.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 or y=1 at t=17.\n\nThus, the sequence above seems optimal.\n\nBut in the beginning, for freeway 1, it is always safe, but we stayed at y=1, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps we can move up to y=5 or something before, but then we have to come back to y=1 for t=16, which takes time and is inefficient.\n\nFor example, suppose we go to y=5 at t=13.\n\nt=13 y=5, safe.\n\nThen we need to be at y=1 at t=16.\n\nFrom y=5 to y=1, it takes 4 steps down.\n\nAt t=13 y=5\n\na13=D → y14=4\n\na14=D → y15=3\n\na15=D → y16=2\n\nBut at t=16, y=2, unsafe.\n\nIf we go faster, but we can't.\n\nAt t=13 y=5, a13=S → y14=5\n\na14=D → y15=4\n\na15=D → y16=3, still unsafe.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo not possible to be at safe y at t=16 from higher position.\n\nTherefore, the initial sequence is best.\n\nSo minimal H=17.\n\nNow, for the actions:\n\nFrom t=8 to t=16, we have actions to be at y=1 during t=9 to t=17.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nTurn t=8: action U (to y=1 at t=9)\n\nThen turns t=9 to t=16: action S each, to stay at y=1 for t=10 to t=17.\n\nAt turn t=9, action S, y_10=1\n\nt=10, action S, y_11=1\n\n...\n\nt=16, action S, y_17=1\n\nThen turn t=17: action U, to y=2 at t=18\n\nt=18: U, to y=3 at t=19\n\nt=19: U, to y=4 at t=20\n\nt=20: U, to y=5 at t=21\n\nt=21: U, to y=6 at t=22\n\nt=22: U, to y=7 at t=23\n\nt=23: U, to y=8 at t=24\n\nt=24: U, to y=9 at t=25\n\nActions from t=8 to t=24.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t=17, we are at y=1, action U to go to y=2.\n\nThen t=18 to t=24 actions U.\n\nNow, for the car on freeway 7 and 8, at t=10,11 they are unsafe, but in this path, at t=10 and 11, we are at y=1, which is safe, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, at t=16,17, we are at y=1, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut is there a way with smaller H?\n\nSuppose we move up to y=7 at t=15, which is safe, then at t=15, we stay or something, but we can't handle t=16.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=8 at t=18 or something, but later.\n\nFor example, after t=17, we go up, but y=8 at t=24, same as before.\n\nNo faster.\n\nSo I think H=17 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1 =8, H=17, so actions from t=8 to t=8+16=24.\n\nt=8 to t=24.\n\nActions:\n\nt=8: U\n\nt=9: S\n\nt=10: S\n\nt=11: S\n\nt=12: S\n\nt=13: S\n\nt=14: S\n\nt=15: S\n\nt=16: S\n\nt=17: U\n\nt=18: U\n\nt=19: U\n\nt=20: U\n\nt=21: U\n\nt=22: U\n\nt=23: U\n\nt=24: U\n\nThen at t=25, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, from t=17 to t=24, we have 8 U actions, from y=1 to y=9, which takes 8 steps, from y=1 to y=9 is 8 moves, yes.\n\ny=1 to y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9: 8 moves.\n\nIn the actions, t=17 U to y=2 at t=18, t=18 U to y=3 at t=19, ..., t=24 U to y=9 at t=25.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, about the cars on freeway 7 and 8 at t=10,11: but we are not on them, we are on y=1, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, at other times.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nBut the problem is to minimize H, and here H=17.\n\nPerhaps we can reduce by one if we can be at higher position after t=17.\n\nFor example, if at t=17 we are at y=2, but we can't because y=2 at t=17 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, we must be at y=1 or y=0 at t=17.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, this is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but we handled the unsafe times.\n\nAlso, for freeway 1, we stayed there, but it's fine.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 17. This sequence ensures that the player is not on any freeway at unsafe times, particularly avoiding \\(t = 16\\) and \\(t = 17\\) for freeways \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 8\\), and the additional unsafe times for \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 10\\) and \\(t = 11\\).\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Unsafe Times**:\n  - Freeways \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 6\\) are unsafe at \\(t = 16\\) and \\(t = 17\\).\n  - Freeway \\(y = 7\\) is unsafe at \\(t = 10\\), \\(t = 11\\), \\(t = 16\\), and \\(t = 17\\).\n  - Freeway \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe at \\(t = 10\\), \\(t = 11\\), \\(t = 16\\), and \\(t = 17\\).\n- **Safe Positions at \\(t = 16\\) and \\(t = 17\\)**: The player must be at \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y = 1\\) (since \\(y = 9\\) is unreachable by then). \\(y = 1\\) is always safe and is used here to minimize turns.\n- **Sequence Strategy**:\n  - Move up to \\(y = 1\\) at \\(t = 9\\).\n  - Stay at \\(y = 1\\) from \\(t = 9\\) to \\(t = 17\\) to avoid all unsafe freeways during \\(t = 16\\) and \\(t = 17\\).\n  - After \\(t = 17\\), move up continuously to \\(y = 9\\) by \\(t = 25\\).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions from turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 8 + 17 - 1 = 24\\) are as follows.

The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway, and they move left or right at constant speeds. Collision happens if at the turn when I'm on a freeway, the x=0 is within the car's span at that turn. Importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn, so I only check collision for the freeway I'm currently on at the beginning of the turn.\n\nThe car states are given for turn t_1=16. I need to find actions from turn 16 to some turn where I reach y=9.\n\nFirst, list all cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nSince it's right-moving, head is at 48, tail at 37? Let me read carefully.\n\nThe notation says: for right-moving, span is [τ, h] with h > τ, I assume, since head is leading.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left: [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, head should be the front, so for right, head > tail, and span is [tail, head]? Let's see the example.\n\nFor freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 12). So head=48, tail=37, and since right-moving, at time T, span is [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [37 + 12ΔT, 48 + 12ΔT], where ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nSimilarly, for others.\n\nNow freeway 2,3,4,5,6 all have the same: (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nBut (-48, -59), if right-moving, head=-48, tail=-59? But -48 > -59, so head is larger, which makes sense for right-moving, span [τ, h] = [-59, -48] at t_1.\n\nThen at T, span is [-59 + 6ΔT, -48 + 6ΔT]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 7 and 8, they have multiple cars.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (-48,-59,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6)\n\nSimilarly freeway 8 same: (-48,-59,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6)\n\nAll cars on freeways 2-8 are right-moving with speed 6, except freeway 1 has a right-moving car with speed 12.\n\nFreeway 1 has only one car, speed 12.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0, which is not a freeway, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is also safe.\n\nAt turn t_1=16, player is at (0,0). I need to move to y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0, but since we want to minimize turns, we should move up as much as possible, but need to avoid collisions when on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nAlso, when moving, if I move from y to y+1, at turn T, I am on y, so I check collision on freeway y at turn T. Then after moving, I am on y+1 for the next turn.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, I am on freeway k, and 0 is in the span of some car on k at turn T.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at turn 16, which is not a freeway, no collision to worry at turn 16. I need to choose action at turn 16 to go to y=0,1, or stay at 0? Action determines where I am at turn 17.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, the player position is y_t. Action a_t is taken, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, and 0 is in the span of some car on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nThe car positions are given at t_1=16, and we need for time T.\n\nNow, since I need to reach y=9, and start from y=0, I need to increase y by 9 units. Each U action increases y by 1, S or D don't, but D decreases, which might be counterproductive. Since we want min turns, I should always go up when possible, but may need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nBut going down might be necessary if I need to wait, but since y=0 is safe, I can stay at y=0 if needed, but that increases turns, so probably not optimal unless necessary.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 is safe, so once I reach, I stop.\n\nNow, the minimal H would be at least 9, since I need 9 up moves, but I might have stay or down moves, so H >=9, but could be more if I need to avoid.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each time, whether there is a car covering x=0 at that time.\n\nSince collision depends on whether 0 is in the car span at time T for freeway k.\n\nLet me define ΔT = T - 16, so at time T=16 + ΔT.\n\nFor each freeway, find when 0 is covered by a car.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, right-moving, span at T: [37 + 12 ΔT, 48 + 12 ΔT]\n\nSet 0 in [37 + 12 ΔT, 48 + 12 ΔT]\n\nSo 37 + 12 ΔT <= 0 <= 48 + 12 ΔT\n\nSince 12 ΔT is integer, ΔT integer.\n\nFirst inequality: 37 + 12 ΔT <= 0 => 12 ΔT <= -37 => ΔT <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, so ΔT <= -4 since integer.\n\nΔT = T-16, T >=16, so ΔT >=0, so 37 + 12 ΔT >=37 >0, so 37 + 12 ΔT <=0 is impossible for ΔT>=0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 48 + 12 ΔT is always true for ΔT >=0.\n\nSo 0 in [37 + 12 ΔT, 48 + 12 ΔT] iff 37 + 12 ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= 48 + 12 ΔT, but first is impossible, so for all ΔT >=0, 0 is not in the interval because lower bound 37+12ΔT >0.\n\nLower bound 37+12ΔT >=37>0, so 0 < lower bound, so 0 not in [lower, upper], since lower >0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, at all times T>=16, no car covers x=0. So freeway 1 is always safe? But let me confirm.\n\nCar at [37+12ΔT, 48+12ΔT], both positive and increasing, so min is 37 at ΔT=0, which is greater than 0, so yes, for all T>=16, the car is to the right of 0, so x=0 is not covered. So freeway 1 is always safe to be on.\n\nIs that right? At T=16, span [37,48], all positive, so yes, no collision at x=0 for freeway 1.\n\nNow freeways 2,3,4,5,6: each has one car: (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nRight-moving, so at T, span [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-59 + 6 ΔT, -48 + 6 ΔT]\n\nSet 0 in [-59 + 6 ΔT, -48 + 6 ΔT]\n\nSo -59 + 6 ΔT <= 0 <= -48 + 6 ΔT\n\nNow, first: -59 + 6 ΔT <= 0 => 6 ΔT <= 59 => ΔT <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833, so ΔT <= 9\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 6 ΔT => 6 ΔT >= 48 => ΔT >= 8\n\nSo for ΔT from 8 to 9 inclusive, 0 is covered.\n\nΔT=8: -59 + 48 = -11 <=0, -48+48=0 <=0? 0 <= -48 + 6*8 = -48+48=0, so 0 <=0, true.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=9: -59 + 54 = -5 <=0, -48+54=6 >=0? 0 <=6, true.\n\nNow ΔT=7: -59+42= -17 <=0, but 0 <= -48+42= -6? 0 <= -6 false, so not covered.\n\nΔT=10: -59+60=1 >0, so not <=0, and 0 <= -48+60=12 true, but lower bound >0, so not covered.\n\nSo for freeways 2,3,4,5,6, collision at x=0 when ΔT=8 or 9, i.e., T=16+8=24 or T=25.\n\nT=24 and T=25.\n\nNow freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars.\n\nFirst, freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6) same as above, so covers x=0 at T=24 and 25.\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nSpan at T: [-23 + 6 ΔT, -12 + 6 ΔT]\n\nSet 0 in [-23 + 6 ΔT, -12 + 6 ΔT]\n\n-23 + 6 ΔT <= 0 <= -12 + 6 ΔT\n\nFirst: -23 + 6 ΔT <=0 => 6 ΔT <=23 => ΔT <= 23/6 ≈3.833, so ΔT <=3\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12 + 6 ΔT => 6 ΔT >=12 => ΔT >=2\n\nSo for ΔT=2 and 3.\n\nΔT=2: -23+12= -11 <=0, -12+12=0 <=0? 0<=0 true.\n\nΔT=3: -23+18= -5 <=0, -12+18=6 >=0, 0<=6 true.\n\nΔT=1: -23+6= -17 <=0, but 0 <= -12+6= -6 false.\n\nΔT=4: -23+24=1 >0, not covered.\n\nSo covers at T=18 and 19 (since ΔT=2,3, T=16+2=18, 19)\n\nT=16+ΔT, ΔT=2, T=18; ΔT=3, T=19.\n\nThird car on freeway 7: (24,13,right,6)\n\nHead=24, tail=13, right-moving, span [13 + 6 ΔT, 24 + 6 ΔT]\n\nSet 0 in [13 + 6 ΔT, 24 + 6 ΔT]\n\n13 + 6 ΔT <= 0 <= 24 + 6 ΔT\n\nBut 13 + 6 ΔT >=13 >0 for ΔT>=0, so lower bound >0, so 0 not in interval. Always safe for this car.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars, so same coverage.\n\nNow freeway 7 has three cars, but only the first two can cover x=0: first at T=24,25; second at T=18,19; third never.\n\nSo for freeway 7, collision when:\n\n- From second car: T=18,19\n\n- From first car: T=24,25\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, identical.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway when it is unsafe (collision possible):\n\n- y=1: always safe, as we saw.\n\n- y=2: unsafe at T=24,25\n\n- y=3: same, unsafe T=24,25\n\n- y=4: same, T=24,25\n\n- y=5: same, T=24,25\n\n- y=6: same, T=24,25\n\n- y=7: unsafe at T=18,19 (from second car) and T=24,25 (from first car)\n\n- y=8: same as y=7, unsafe T=18,19 and T=24,25\n\ny=7 and y=8 have additional unsafe times at T=18,19 from the second car.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at turn 16.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 in min turns.\n\nEach turn, I choose to go U, D, or S.\n\ny changes by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn T, and for each turn when I am on y=1 to 8, it must be safe at that turn.\n\nAlso, when I am moving, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I move to y_{T+1} based on action a_T.\n\nFor example, at turn T, position y_T. If I am on freeway (y_T in 1-8), it must be safe at time T.\n\nThen I take action, go to y_{T+1}.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nStart at turn 16, y=0.\n\nTurn 16: I am at y=0, not freeway, safe. I take action a_{16}.\n\nAfter action, y_{17} = y_{16} + Δy, depending on a_{16}.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 17, I am at y_{17}, and so on.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal possible H: if I go up every turn, from y=0, after 9 up moves, I reach y=9 at turn 16+9=25? Let's see.\n\nStart turn 16, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{16}, y_{17} = 0 + Δy.\n\nAfter a_{17}, y_{18} = y_{17} + Δy, and so on, up to after a_{16+H-1}, y_{16+H} = position after H actions? Let's index carefully.\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t.\n\nAt turn t_1=16, y_{16} = 0.\n\nAfter action a_{16}, y_{17} is set.\n\nThen at turn 17, position y_{17}, and so on.\n\nI need y_T = 9 for some T.\n\nThe turn when I first reach y=9, I can stop.\n\nH is the number of actions, so from turn 16 to turn 16+H-1, I take actions, and after H actions, I am at turn 16+H.\n\nDefine: after k actions, at turn 16+k.\n\nStart: turn 16, y_{16} = 0.\n\nAfter action a_{16}, y_{17} = y_{16} + Δy_{16}\n\nAfter action a_{17}, y_{18} = y_{17} + Δy_{17}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{16+H-1}, y_{16+H} = y_{16+H-1} + Δy_{16+H-1}\n\nI need y_{16+H} = 9.\n\nAnd for each turn t from 16 to 16+H-1, when I am at y_t, if y_t in 1-8, it must be safe at time t.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, I take action a_t, then move to y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision check, at turn t, if y_t in 1-8, then we check if collision at time t.\n\nIf I move to y_{t+1}, at turn t, I am still on y_t, so y_{t+1} is not checked at turn t, only at turn t+1.\n\nIn this case, since I start at y=0 at t=16, which is safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn T=16+H.\n\nNow, if I go up every turn, starting from y=0 at t=16.\n\na_{16} = U, then y_{17} = 1\n\nAt turn 17, y=1, which is freeway 1. Freeway 1 is always safe, as we saw.\n\na_{17} = U, y_{18} = 2\n\nAt turn 18, y=2. Freeway 2 is unsafe only at t=24,25. t=18 is not unsafe, so safe.\n\na_{18} = U, y_{19} = 3\n\nTurn 19, y=3, safe, since unsafe only at 24,25.\n\na_{19} = U, y_{20} = 4\n\nTurn 20, y=4, safe.\n\na_{20} = U, y_{21} = 5\n\nTurn 21, y=5, safe.\n\na_{21} = U, y_{22} = 6\n\nTurn 22, y=6, unsafe at 24,25, t=22 safe.\n\na_{22} = U, y_{23} = 7\n\nTurn 23, y=7. Freeway 7 unsafe at t=18,19 and 24,25. t=23 not unsafe, so safe.\n\na_{23} = U, y_{24} = 8\n\nTurn 24, y=8. Freeway 8 unsafe at t=18,19 and 24,25. t=24 is unsafe! Collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt turn 24, y=8, which is unsafe.\n\nIf I go up directly, at turn 24 I am on y=8 when it is unsafe.\n\ny_{23} =7, then a_{23}=U, so at turn 24, y_{24}=8.\n\nTurn 24, position y=8, which is freeway 8, and at t=24, unsafe.\n\nSo collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I continue, at turn 25, y=9, but I need to be at y=9, but at turn 24 I have collision.\n\ny=9 is safe, but I was on y=8 at turn 24.\n\nIn this path, I reach y=8 at turn 24, which is unsafe.\n\nThen if I go up at turn 24, y_{25}=9, but at turn 24 I am on y=8, unsafe.\n\nSo I need to avoid that.\n\nI could be slower or faster.\n\nList the positions if I go up every turn:\n\nt=16: y=0 (safe, not freeway)\n\na16=U, y17=1\n\nt=17: y=1 (freeway1, safe)\n\na17=U, y18=2\n\nt=18: y=2 (freeway2, safe since not 24,25)\n\nFreeway2 unsafe only at 24,25, t=18 safe.\n\na18=U, y19=3\n\nt=19: y=3, safe\n\na19=U, y20=4\n\nt=20: y=4, safe\n\na20=U, y21=5\n\nt=21: y=5, safe\n\na21=U, y22=6\n\nt=22: y=6, safe (unsafe at 24,25, t=22 ok)\n\na22=U, y23=7\n\nt=23: y=7, freeway7 unsafe at 18,19 and 24,25; t=23 not unsafe, safe\n\na23=U, y24=8\n\nt=24: y=8, unsafe! Collision.\n\nProblem at t=24.\n\nIf I stay or go down at some point to delay.\n\nI need to reach y=9 later.\n\nSince y=7 is safe at t=23, I could stay at y=7 for one turn.\n\nThen go up.\n\nTry:\n\nFrom above, at t=23, y=7, safe.\n\nInstead of going up, I stay: a23=S, then y24=7 (still)\n\nt=24: y=7, freeway7. At t=24, freeway7 unsafe? Freeway7 unsafe at t=24,25 from first car.\n\nYes, t=24 unsafe for y=7.\n\nIf I stay at y=7 at t=24, collision.\n\nGo down? a23=D, then y24=6.\n\nt=24: y=6, freeway6, unsafe at t=24,25, so collision.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo at t=23, y=7, if I do anything, at t=24 I go to y=6,7, or8, all unsafe if I am on them at t=24.\n\ny=6,7,8 all unsafe at t=24.\n\ny=6 is freeway6, unsafe at t=24,25.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=24,25.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=24,25.\n\nSo at turn t=24, any of y=6,7,8 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly t=25.\n\nNow, y=1 to5 are safe at t=24,25? y=2,3,4,5,6 unsafe at t=24,25, but y=1 is always safe.\n\ny=1 always safe.\n\ny=2,3,4,5,6 unsafe only at t=24,25, so at other times safe.\n\ny=7 and8 unsafe at t=18,19 and 24,25.\n\nt=18,19 are earlier.\n\nIn my direct path, I was at y=2 at t=18, which is safe, since y=2 unsafe only at 24,25.\n\nt=18 y=2 safe.\n\nThe issue is at t=24.\n\nTo avoid t=24 on freeway, I need to not be on y=1 to8 at t=24? But y=1 is safe, so I can be on y=1 at t=24.\n\nOr be on y=0 or9, but y=9 is goal.\n\nSo possible to be on y=1 at t=24, or y=0 or9.\n\nBut I start from low, so perhaps delay so that at t=24 I am low.\n\nSince min turns, I want to go up, but need to spend time at safe positions during unsafe times.\n\nUnsafe times for freeways: t=18,19 for y=7 and8, and t=24,25 for y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nt=24,25 all y=2 to8 unsafe except y=1 safe.\n\ny=1 always safe.\n\nNow, t=18,19 only y=7 and8 unsafe, others safe.\n\nIn my direct up path, I reach y=7 at t=23, which is before t=24, and safe.\n\nBut then at t=24 I need to go to y=8, which is unsafe.\n\nI could go to y=8 earlier or later.\n\nFor example, if I go faster to y=8 before t=18 or after t=25.\n\nt=18,19 y=8 unsafe, so I can be on y=8 only when t<18 or t>19 and not 24,25.\n\nt=24,25 also unsafe.\n\nSo safe for y=8 only when t not 18,19,24,25.\n\nSimilarly for y=7, safe when not 18,19,24,25.\n\nNow, I start at t=16, y=0.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe critical times are t=24,25.\n\nTo avoid being on freeway at t=24 and t=25.\n\nSince y=1 is safe at t=24,25, I can be on y=1 at that time.\n\nOr be on y=0 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is goal, so if I reach earlier, good.\n\nNow, let's list possible paths.\n\nFirst, if I can reach y=9 by t=23, before the unsafe period.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=16, to y=9 in 7 moves? y_{16} =0, after 9 up moves, y_{25}=9, but at t=24 y=8 unsafe.\n\nTo reach y=9 earlier.\n\nMin turns to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 actions, reaching at turn 16+9=25.\n\nAfter k up moves, y_{16+k} = k.\n\nSet y_{16+k} =9, so k=9, turn 25.\n\nBut at turn 24, y=8, which is unsafe if I go directly.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at turn T where for t=24 and 25, I am not on freeway, or safe.\n\nFor example, if I am on y=1 at t=24, safe, then go up.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9 eventually.\n\nSince y=1 is safe at all times, I can stay there during unsafe periods.\n\nBut that might increase turns.\n\nFirst, can I reach y=9 before t=24?\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn T, I need to have taken actions from t=16 to t=T-1, 9 up moves, so T-16 =9 if all up, so T=25.\n\nMinimal T is 25, since from y=0 to y=9, need 9 increases.\n\nStart y16=0, after first action y17, which could be 0 or1, but to increase, y17=1 if U.\n\nThen y18, up to yT.\n\nyT = number of U minus number of D, since start from 0.\n\nTo reach 9, net +9, so number of U minus number of D =9.\n\nEach S adds 0, so to minimize turns, minimize S and D, so ideally all U, H=9, reach at T=25.\n\nBut at T=24, y=8, unsafe.\n\nSo I need to be at a different position at T=24.\n\nFor example, at T=24, be at y=1, which is safe.\n\nThen from there go up to y=9.\n\nBut that would take more turns.\n\nLet's plan the sequence.\n\nI need to spend the unsafe times at safe positions.\n\nUnsafe times: t=18,19 for y=7,8; t=24,25 for y=2-8 except y=1.\n\nt=24 and 25 are problematic for most freeways.\n\nAt t=24 and 25, only y=1 is safe to be on.\n\nSo I should be on y=1 at t=24 and/or t=25.\n\ny=0 or y=9 are also safe, but y=0 is start, y=9 goal.\n\nNow, t=18 and 19, y=7 and 8 are unsafe, but other y are safe, so I can be on other freeways or y=0,9.\n\nBut since I am going up, I might be at lower y at that time.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I want to go up as much as possible, but delay to avoid t=24 on y>1.\n\nFor example, I can go up to y=1 quickly and stay there until after t=25, but that would take many extra turns.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nGo up slowly.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=7 before t=18, but t=18 is early.\n\nt=16 to t=18 only 2 turns.\n\nAt t=16, y=0.\n\nAfter a16, y17=1 (U)\n\nt=17, y=1, safe.\n\na17=U, y18=2\n\nt=18, y=2, safe (since y=2 unsafe only at 24,25)\n\na18=U, y19=3\n\nt=19, y=3, safe\n\na19=U, y20=4\n\nt=20, y=4, safe\n\na20=U, y21=5\n\nt=21, y=5, safe\n\na21=U, y22=6\n\nt=22, y=6, safe\n\na22=U, y23=7\n\nt=23, y=7, safe (not 18,19 or 24,25)\n\nNow, at t=23, y=7, I need to avoid being on freeway at t=24.\n\nIf I go up to y=8 at t=24, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, y24=7, unsafe at t=24.\n\nIf I go down, y24=6, unsafe at t=24.\n\nAll bad.\n\nSo I need to be not on y=2-8 at t=24.\n\nOnly y=1,0,9.\n\nSo at t=24, I must be on y=1 or less, or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is far, I am at y=7 at t=23, so to be at y=9 at t=24, I need to go up twice, impossible in one action.\n\nFrom y=7, I can go to y=6,7,8 at t=24.\n\nNone safe.\n\nSo I need to be at a lower y at t=23 or earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=23, if I am at y=1, then at t=24 I can be on y=1, safe.\n\nThen after t=25, I can go up.\n\nBut how to be at y=1 at t=23.\n\nIn the direct path, I am at y=7 at t=23.\n\nI need to be slower.\n\nSo perhaps I should not go up all the way.\n\nFor example, stay at some safe point.\n\nLet's list the safe times for each y.\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: safe when t not 24,25\n\ny=3: same, not 24,25\n\ny=4: not 24,25\n\ny=5: not 24,25\n\ny=6: not 24,25\n\ny=7: safe when t not 18,19 and not 24,25\n\ny=8: safe when t not 18,19 and not 24,25\n\nNow, t from 16 onwards.\n\nI need to be on these freeways only during safe times.\n\nFor example, to go from y=0 to y=9, I need to pass through each y=1 to8.\n\nBut I can stay or move down to spend time.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should move up when possible.\n\nBut at t=24 and 25, I must be on y=1 or y=0 or y=9.\n\nSince I start from below, y=0 or y=1.\n\nSimilarly, at t=18,19, I should not be on y=7 or8.\n\nt=18,19 are early, so if I am slow, I might be at lower y.\n\nLet's find a path where at t=24 and t=25, I am on y=1.\n\nFor example, at t=24, y=1; t=25, y=1 or y=2, etc.\n\nBut y=1 at t=24 is safe.\n\nThen after t=25, I can go up.\n\nFirst, how to be at y=1 at t=24.\n\nAt t=16, y=0.\n\nI need to take actions to reach y=1 at t=24.\n\nBut that would take many turns, inefficient.\n\nFrom t=16 to t=24 is 8 turns, I can be at y=1 by t=17, then stay for many turns.\n\nBut let's calculate min H.\n\nSuppose I go to y=1 quickly, say at t=17, y=1.\n\nThen I stay at y=1 from t=17 to t=25, for example, to avoid unsafe times.\n\nThen at t=25, I am at y=1, safe.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9 from there.\n\nFrom y=1 to y=9, need 8 up moves, so at least 8 turns, reach at t=25+8=33, which is late, H=33-16=17 turns, but min is 9, so bad.\n\nI can leave earlier.\n\nBut at t=24, I can be on y=1, then after t=25, I can go up.\n\nt=25 is also unsafe for most, but y=1 is safe at t=25.\n\nAt t=25, y=1 safe.\n\nThen from t=25 on, I can go up.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nNow, what about the earlier unsafe times t=18,19 for y=7 and8.\n\nSince I am at low y at that time, not a problem.\n\nFor example, at t=18,19, if I am on y=2 or3, it is safe, since only y=7,8 unsafe at that time.\n\nSo in this case, I can go up slowly to be at y=1 at t=24.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=16: y=0, a16=U, y17=1\n\nt=17: y=1, a17=S, y18=1\n\nt=18: y=1, a18=S, y19=1\n\n...\nI need to stay at y=1 from t=17 to t=24 or something.\n\nAt t=24, I am on y=1.\n\nThen at t=24, I am on y=1, safe, then I can start going up.\n\nBut at t=24, after action, I can go to y=2 or stay.\n\nBut t=25, if I am on y=2, unsafe, so I need to be careful.\n\nSet t=24: I am at y=1, safe.\n\nThen a24=U, y25=2\n\nBut at t=25, y=2, which is unsafe at t=25.\n\nCollision.\n\nSo at t=25, if I am on y=2, unsafe.\n\nSo I need to be on y=1 at t=25 as well, or y=0 or9.\n\nSo perhaps stay at y=1 at t=24 and t=25.\n\nThen after that go up.\n\nBut that delays more.\n\nAt t=24, I am on y=1, safe.\n\na24=S, y25=1\n\nt=25: y=1, safe.\n\nThen a25=U, y26=2\n\nt=26: y=2, now t=26>25, so safe for y=2.\n\nThen I can go up to y=9.\n\nBut from t=26 on, I can go up directly.\n\ny26=2, then to y=9, need 7 up moves, reach at t=26+7=33.\n\nTurns from t=16 to t=32 for actions? Let's see.\n\nPosition at turn t.\n\nt=16: y=0\n\nActions from t=16 to t=32 for 17 actions, y33=2 +7 =9? y26=2, after a26 to a32, 7 actions, y33=9.\n\nBut H is number of actions, from t=16 to t=16+H-1, y_{16+H} =9.\n\ny_{16+H} =9.\n\nIf y33=9, then 16+H=33, H=17.\n\nBut earlier with direct but collision, it was 9 turns to reach at t=25.\n\nSo 17 is worse.\n\nI can be at higher y before t=24.\n\nFor example, reach y=7 before t=18.\n\nt=18 is turn 18.\n\nAt t=16, y=0.\n\na16=U, y17=1\n\nt=17: y=1, a17=U, y18=2\n\nBut at t=18, if I go U, y19=3, etc.\n\nTo reach y=7 at t=17 or earlier.\n\nt=16 to t=17 only one action, from y=0 to y=1, cannot reach y=7.\n\nMax at t=17 is y=1.\n\nSo cannot be on y=7 before t=18.\n\nSimilarly, after t=19, y=7 is safe until t=24.\n\nSo from t=20 to t=23, I can be on y=7.\n\nThen at t=24, I need to not be on freeway.\n\nSo from y=7 at t=23, I need to go to y=1 or something, but I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nFrom y=7 at t=23, to be at y=1 at t=24, impossible, since |Δy|<=1.\n\nSo I can only be at y=6,7,8 at t=24, all unsafe.\n\nSo I must be at y<=1 at t=23 or earlier to be at y=1 at t=24.\n\nFor example, at t=23, be at y=1.\n\nThen at t=24, I can be at y=1 or y=2, but y=2 unsafe at t=24, so better stay at y=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo let's plan to be at y=1 at t=23 and t=24.\n\nThen after that go up.\n\nHow to be at y=1 at t=23.\n\nFrom t=16, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=1 and stay or something.\n\nFor example, go to y=1 at t=17, then stay until t=23.\n\nThat means from t=17 to t=22, I am at y=1, staying.\n\nThen at t=23, y=1.\n\na23=S, y24=1\n\nt=24: y=1, safe\n\na24=S, y25=1\n\nt=25: y=1, safe\n\nThen a25=U, y26=2\n\nt=26: y=2, safe (t=26>25)\n\na26=U, y27=3\n\n...\n\nUp to a32=U, y33=9\n\nReach at t=33, H=17 actions from t=16 to t=32.\n\nBut this is slow.\n\nI can go up faster initially and then come down or something, but that seems inefficient.\n\nAnother idea: since y=1 is always safe, I can be on y=1 during t=24,25, but I don't need to stay there long; I can be on other freeways when safe.\n\nFor example, I can go up to y=6 or something before t=24, but y=6 is safe before t=24, but at t=24 it is unsafe, so I need to be off it.\n\nBut from y=6, I can only go to y=5,6,7 at t=24, all unsafe.\n\nSo I must be at y=1 or below at t=24.\n\nSimilarly for t=25.\n\nSo the only way is to be at low y during t=24,25.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should be at high y as possible before and after.\n\nFor example, reach y=6 by t=22, for example.\n\nIn direct path, at t=22, y=6.\n\nThen from t=22, I need to go down to y=1 by t=24.\n\nFrom y=6 at t=22, to y=1 at t=24.\n\nIn two turns, I can go down twice: a22=D, y23=5; a23=D, y24=4, but y=4 at t=24 unsafe.\n\nOr a22=D, y23=5; a23=S, y24=5, unsafe.\n\nOr a22=S, y23=6; a23=D, y24=5, unsafe.\n\nAll lead to y=4,5,6 at t=24, unsafe.\n\nCannot reach y=1 from y=6 in two turns.\n\nMax down is to y=4 at t=24.\n\nFrom y=6 at t=22, after two down, y24=4.\n\nBut y=4 unsafe at t=24.\n\nIf I go down faster, but from t=22, only two actions to t=24.\n\ny at t=24 depends on actions at t=22 and t=23.\n\nAt t=22, position y22, action a22, y23 = y22 + Δy\n\nThen at t=23, action a23, y24 = y23 + Δy\n\nSo to have y24=1, I need y22 such that in two steps I can reach y=1.\n\nFor example, if y22=1, then a22=S, y23=1; a23=S, y24=1.\n\nOr y22=2, then a22=D, y23=1; a23=S, y24=1.\n\nOr y22=3, a22=D, y23=2; a23=D, y24=1.\n\nSimilarly, y22=1,2,3 can reach y=1 at t=24 with appropriate actions.\n\ny22=4: a22=D, y23=3; a23=D, y24=2, not 1.\n\nMax down to y=2 from y=4 in two steps.\n\nSimilarly, y22=5 to y=3 or4, etc.\n\nSo to be at y=1 at t=24, I need to be at y=1,2, or3 at t=22.\n\nSimilarly for other times.\n\nBut let's think of the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 before t=24, but impossible since min turn 25.\n\nOr after t=25.\n\nSo reach at t=26 or later.\n\nBut at t=25, I can be on y=9 if I reach it, but to reach y=9 at t=25, I must be on y=8 at t=24, which is unsafe.\n\nConflict.\n\nUnless I can reach y=9 at t=24 or earlier, impossible.\n\nOr at t=26.\n\nFor example, at t=25, be on y=8, but t=25 unsafe for y=8.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=8 at t=25 either.\n\nSo the only way to reach y=9 is to be at y=8 at some turn when it is safe, then go U.\n\nBut at t=24 and 25, y=8 unsafe, and at t=18,19 unsafe, so safe turns for y=8 are t=16 to17,20 to23,26 and later.\n\nSimilarly for y=7.\n\nBut t=16 I am at y=0, so can't be on y=8.\n\nEarliest to be on y=8 is t=24 if I go fast, but unsafe.\n\nOr t=23: from start, if all U, at t=23 y=7, as before.\n\nThen at t=23, y=7, I can go U to y=8 at t=24, but t=24 unsafe for y=8.\n\nGo at t=26.\n\nBut how to be on y=8 at t=26.\n\nFor that, I need to be at y=7 at t=25 or something.\n\nLet's list the safe turns for each freeway.\n\ny=1: all t\n\ny=2: t <=23 or t>=26\n\ny=3: same\n\ny=4: same\n\ny=5: same\n\ny=6: same\n\ny=7: t <=17 or 20<=t<=23 or t>=26\n\ny=8: t <=17 or 20<=t<=23 or t>=26\n\nNow, to go from y=0 to y=9, I need to pass through each level.\n\nThe constraining points are between y=7 and y=8.\n\nFor example, to be on y=7 at safe time, then go to y=8 at safe time.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSince y=2 to6 are safe except t=24,25, I can be on them when t not 24,25.\n\nSo for the path, I can go up to y=6 by t=22, for example.\n\nt=22, y=6, safe.\n\nThen from t=22, I need to go to y=7, but at t=23, y=7 is safe (t=23 between 20 and 23).\n\nThen at t=23, y=7, safe.\n\nThen I need to go to y=8 at a safe time, but next safe time for y=8 is t=26.\n\nSo at t=23, y=7, I can stay or go down, but I need to go to y=8 later.\n\nBut at t=24, if I go to y=8, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at y=7, at t=24 unsafe.\n\nIf I go down to y=6, at t=24 unsafe.\n\nSo I must leave the area before t=24.\n\nFor example, from y=7 at t=23, go down to y=1 by t=24, but impossible in one step.\n\nFrom t=23 to t=24, only one action, so I can only be at y=6,7,8 at t=24, all unsafe.\n\nSo the only possibility is to be at y=1 at t=24 and t=25.\n\nThen after t=25, go up to y=9.\n\nBut as before, it takes many turns.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 at t=26.\n\nFor example, at t=25, be at y=8, but t=25 unsafe for y=8.\n\nCannot.\n\nAt t=26, be at y=8, then go U to y=9 at t=27.\n\nBut let's see how.\n\nFirst, be at y=8 at t=26.\n\nt=26 is safe for y=8.\n\nThen a26=U, y27=9.\n\nReach at t=27.\n\nH to reach at t=27, from t=16 to t=27, 11 turns? y27=9, so 11 actions.\n\nPosition at turn t.\n\nStart t=16 y=0.\n\nAfter 11 actions, at t=27, y=9.\n\nNumber of U minus D =9, with S possible.\n\nMin U is 9, so min turns 9, but with constraints.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=26.\n\nHow to be at y=8 at t=26.\n\nFrom start, it takes 8 up moves to reach y=8, at turn 16+8=24, but at t=24 y=8 unsafe.\n\nSo I need to reach later or earlier, but earlier impossible.\n\nSo I must have some down or stay moves to delay.\n\nFor example, go up to y=6 by t=22.\n\nt=22 y=6.\n\nThen from t=22, I need to go to y=8 at t=26, which is 4 turns later.\n\nIn 4 turns, from y=6, I can go to y=8 with two U and two S, for example.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on freeway at t=24 and 25.\n\nAt t=24 and 25, I must not be on y=2-8, so be on y=1.\n\nSo from t=22 y=6, I need to go down to y=1 by t=24.\n\nIn two turns: from y=6 to y=1 in two steps? Impossible, min y=4 at t=24.\n\nAs before.\n\nWith three turns.\n\nFor example, at t=22 y=6.\n\na22=D, y23=5\n\nt=23 y=5, safe (t=23 not 24,25)\n\na23=D, y24=4\n\nt=24 y=4, unsafe! Collision.\n\na22=D, y23=5\n\na23=S, y24=5, unsafe.\n\na22=S, y23=6\n\na23=D, y24=5, unsafe.\n\nAll bad.\n\na22=D, y23=5\n\na23=D, y24=4, unsafe.\n\nCannot avoid.\n\nSo from y=6 at t=22, in two actions, I can only be at y=4,5,6 at t=24, all unsafe.\n\nI need to be lower at t=22.\n\nFor example, at t=22, be at y=3.\n\nThen I can go to y=1 at t=24.\n\nFor example, t=22 y=3\n\na22=D, y23=2\n\nt=23 y=2, safe (t=23<24)\n\na23=D, y24=1\n\nt=24 y=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=24, y=1, safe.\n\na24=S, y25=1  (stay at y=1 for t=25)\n\nt=25 y=1, safe.\n\nThen a25=U, y26=2\n\nt=26 y=2, safe (t=26>25)\n\na26=U, y27=3\n\na27=U, y28=4\n\na28=U, y29=5\n\na29=U, y30=6\n\na30=U, y31=7\n\nt=31 y=7, now t=31, which is after 25, so safe for y=7.\n\na31=U, y32=8\n\nt=32 y=8, t=32>25, safe.\n\na32=U, y33=9\n\nReach at t=33.\n\nH=17 actions.\n\nBut this is from being at y=3 at t=22.\n\nHow to be at y=3 at t=22.\n\nFrom start, at t=16 y=0.\n\nGo up to y=3 at t=19, for example.\n\nt=16: a16=U, y17=1\n\nt=17: a17=U, y18=2\n\nt=18: a18=U, y19=3\n\nThen from t=19 to t=22, I need to stay at y=3 or something.\n\nBut t=19 y=3, safe.\n\nThen to be at y=3 at t=22, I can stay from t=19 to t=22.\n\na19=S, y20=3\n\nt=20 y=3, safe\n\na20=S, y21=3\n\nt=21 y=3, safe\n\na21=S, y22=3\n\nt=22 y=3, as above.\n\nThen proceed as above.\n\nBut at t=22 y=3, then down to y=1 at t=24, etc.\n\nBut in this case, I reached y=3 at t=19, then stayed until t=22, which is inefficient.\n\nI can go slower to y=3.\n\nBut let's count the turns.\n\nActions:\n\nt=16: U, y17=1\n\nt=17: U, y18=2\n\nt=18: U, y19=3\n\nt=19: S, y20=3\n\nt=20: S, y21=3\n\nt=21: S, y22=3\n\nt=22: D, y23=2\n\nt=23: D, y24=1\n\nt=24: S, y25=1  (stay for t=25)\n\nt=25: U, y26=2\n\nt=26: U, y27=3\n\nt=27: U, y28=4\n\nt=28: U, y29=5\n\nt=29: U, y30=6\n\nt=30: U, y31=7\n\nt=31: U, y32=8\n\nt=32: U, y33=9\n\nReach at t=33, H=17 actions (from t=16 to t=32).\n\nBut earlier with direct, H=9 but collision, so this is collision-free but slow.\n\nI can reduce some stay.\n\nFor example, after t=25, I go directly up.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=25 to y=9, need 8 U, from t=25 to t=32, y33=9, same as above.\n\nBut at t=26 y=2, etc, all safe since t>25.\n\nBut the delay is from t=19 to t=22 staying at y=3 for 3 turns, and from t=24 to t=25 at y=1 for 2 turns, but t=24 and 25 are required to be at safe zone.\n\nNotice that at t=18 and 19, I am at y=2 and 3, which is safe, no problem.\n\nBut to save turns, I can be at higher y before t=24.\n\nFor example, at t=23, be at y=1, but how?\n\nIf I am at y=1 at t=23, then I can go to y=2 at t=24, but y=2 unsafe at t=24, so I should stay at y=1.\n\nBut to be at y=1 at t=23, from start, I can go to y=1 at t=17, then stay until t=23.\n\nThen from t=17 to t=23, 6 turns at y=1.\n\nThen t=24 at y=1, t=25 at y=1, then go up to y=9 from t=25 to t=32, y33=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nGo to y=4 at t=20, for example, then down to y=1 at t=24.\n\nLet's calculate.\n\nFrom t=16: U, y17=1\n\nt=17: U, y18=2\n\nt=18: U, y19=3\n\nt=19: U, y20=4  (y=4 at t=20, safe)\n\nThen from y=4 at t=20, need to be at y=1 at t=24.\n\n4 turns: t=20 to t=24.\n\nActions at t=20,21,22,23 for y at t=21,22,23,24.\n\nTo have y24=1.\n\nStart from y20=4.\n\na20=D, y21=3\n\na21=D, y22=2\n\na22=D, y23=1\n\na23=S, y24=1  (for example)\n\nThen t=24 y=1, safe.\n\na24=S, y25=1, t=25 y=1, safe.\n\na25=U, y26=2\n\n...\n\nUp to a32=U, y33=9\n\nNow, from t=20 to t=23, I used 3 D and 1 S to go from y=4 to y=1.\n\nThen from t=25 to t=32, 8 U to go to y=9.\n\nList all actions:\n\nt=16: U, y17=1\n\nt=17: U, y18=2\n\nt=18: U, y19=3\n\nt=19: U, y20=4\n\nt=20: D, y21=3\n\nt=21: D, y22=2\n\nt=22: D, y23=1\n\nt=23: S, y24=1  (at t=24 y=1)\n\nt=24: S, y25=1  (at t=25 y=1)\n\nt=25: U, y26=2\n\nt=26: U, y27=3\n\nt=27: U, y28=4\n\nt=28: U, y29=5\n\nt=29: U, y30=6\n\nt=30: U, y31=7\n\nt=31: U, y32=8\n\nt=32: U, y33=9\n\nReach at t=33, H=17 actions.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut at t=19, I am at y=4, which is safe, and I go down to y=1 for t=24.\n\nBut I have three down moves, which are counterproductive.\n\nPerhaps I can have fewer down moves by being lower earlier.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=24 and 25, I must be on y=1, I can be on y=0, but y=0 is safe, but I start there, and going down from y=0 keeps at 0.\n\nBut y=0 is not freeway, safe.\n\nSo I can be at y=0 at t=24 and 25.\n\nThen go up after.\n\nBut to be at y=0 at t=24, from higher y, I need to go down.\n\nFor example, from y=3 at t=22, go down to y=0 at t=24.\n\ny22=3\n\na22=D, y23=2\n\na23=D, y24=1, not 0.\n\nTo y=0: from y=3, a22=D, y23=2; a23=D, y24=1; not 0.\n\nOr if I am at y=2 at t=23, a23=D, y24=1.\n\nCannot reach y=0 from above in few steps; need to be at y=0 and stay.\n\nBut if I am at y=0 at t=24, I must have been there for some time.\n\nFor example, stay at y=0 from t=16 to t=24, then go up, but very slow.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo better to be at y=1.\n\nNow, to save turns, I can go up to y=7 or 8 after t=25 quickly.\n\nBut I need to be at y=1 at t=24 and 25, then from there to y=9, 8 steps.\n\nMin H is 8 plus the time to reach y=1 from start with constraints.\n\nFrom start to y=1, min 1 turn, at t=17.\n\nThen stay until t=25, that's 8 turns at y=1 (t=17 to 24), then from t=25 to t=32, 8 turns to y=9, total from t=16 to t=32, 17 actions.\n\nBut at t=17 to t=24, 8 turns at y=1, but t=17 to t=24 is 8 turns, position at those turns is y=1.\n\nThen from t=25, start going up.\n\nBut t=25 action a25=U, y26=2, etc.\n\nReach y33=9.\n\nH=17.\n\nI can reduce the stay at y=1.\n\nFor example, at t=24, I am at y=1, and at t=25, I can be at y=2, but y=2 unsafe at t=25, so I cannot.\n\nUnless I reach y=9 at t=25, impossible.\n\nSo I must be at y=1 at both t=24 and t=25 or at y=0 or9.\n\nSo at least for t=24 and 25, I am at y=1.\n\nThen after that, go up.\n\nThe only way to have fewer turns is to be at higher y before t=24 and come down with fewer down moves, but as we saw, I need to be at low y at t=22 or 23 to reach y=1 at t=24.\n\nFor example, if I am at y=1 at t=23, then I can be at y=1 at t=24 with S.\n\nThen at t=25, I must be at y=1, so a24=S, y25=1.\n\nThen go up.\n\nTo be at y=1 at t=23, I can reach earlier and stay less.\n\nFor example, go to y=1 at t=17, then stay from t=17 to t=23, 7 turns at y=1, then t=24 at y=1, t=25 at y=1, then go up from t=25 to t=32, y33=9.\n\nFrom t=17 to t=24 at y=1 is 8 turns (t=17 to 24 inclusive is 8 positions), but actions from t=17 to t=23 are S, keeping y=1.\n\nAt t=23, position y=1, a23=S, y24=1\n\nt=24 y=1, a24=S, y25=1\n\nt=25 y=1, a25=U, y26=2, etc.\n\nSame as before.\n\nReach at t=33.\n\nH=17.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe times for other freeways.\n\nIn this path, when I am on freeways:\n\nt=17: y=1, safe\n\nt=18: y=1, safe\n\nt=19: y=1, safe\n\nt=20: y=1, safe\n\nt=21: y=1, safe\n\nt=22: y=1, safe\n\nt=23: y=1, safe\n\nt=24: y=1, safe\n\nt=25: y=1, safe\n\nThen t=26: y=2, t=26>25, safe\n\nt=27: y=3, safe\n\n...\n\nup to t=32: y=8, safe\n\nt=33: y=9, safe, goal.\n\nNo collision.\n\nBut H=17.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up later or something, but not better.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=8 at t=23, which is safe for y=8 (t=23 between 20 and 23).\n\nThen at t=23, y=8, safe.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9, but at t=24, if I go U, y24=9, but at turn t=24, I am on y=8 when I take action, so position at t=24 is y=8 before action?

No, because y=8 is safe at t=23.\n\nThen at t=24, I am on y=9, no collision.\n\nAnd I reach at t=24.\n\nBut y24=9, so at turn t=24, position y=9.\n\nHow to be at y=8 at t=23.\n\nFrom start, all U: a16=U, y17=1\n\na17=U, y18=2\n\na18=U, y19=3\n\na19=U, y20=4\n\na20=U, y21=5\n\na21=U, y22=6\n\na22=U, y23=7\n\na23=U, y24=8? No, from y23=7, a23=U, y24=8.\n\nBut at t=23, y=7, not 8.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=23, I need y23=8.\n\nFrom y16=0, after 7 actions, y23 = number of U minus D.\n\nWith 7 U, y23=7.\n\nWith 8 U, but only 7 actions from t=16 to t=22 for y23.\n\nActions: a16 to a22 determine y23.\n\n7 actions, min y23=0, max 7.\n\nSo y23<=7, cannot be 8 at t=23.\n\nEarliest to be at y=8 is t=24 with 8 U, but unsafe.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 at t=23.\n\nSimilarly, at t=22, max y=6.\n\nSo back to square one.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at t=26 by being at y=8 at t=25, but t=25 unsafe for y=8.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo the only collision-free way with min turns might be to have H=17 as above.\n\nBut let's see if I can do with less.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=5 by t=21.\n\nt=21 y=5, safe.\n\nThen from t=21 to t=24, 3 turns, I need to be at y=1 at t=24.\n\nFrom y=5, in 3 turns, I can go to y=2, for example.\n\na21=D, y22=4\n\na22=D, y23=3\n\na23=D, y24=2\n\nThen t=24 y=2, unsafe.\n\na21=D, y22=4\n\na22=D, y23=3\n\na23=S, y24=3, unsafe.\n\na21=D, y22=4\n\na22=S, y23=4\n\na23=D, y24=3, unsafe.\n\na21=S, y22=5\n\na22=D, y23=4\n\na23=D, y24=3, unsafe.\n\nAll lead to y=2,3,4 at t=24, unsafe.\n\nWith three actions, from y=5, min y at t=24 is 2, which is unsafe.\n\nCannot reach y=1.\n\nWith four actions, from t=21 to t=24, actions at t=21,22,23 for y at t=22,23,24.\n\nTo have y24=1, need to start from lower.\n\nFor example, at t=21, be at y=2.\n\nThen a21=D, y22=1\n\na22=S, y23=1\n\na23=S, y24=1\n\nThen safe.\n\nBut how to be at y=2 at t=21.\n\nFrom start, go up to y=2 at t=18.\n\nThen stay or something.\n\nLet's outline.\n\nt=16: U, y17=1\n\nt=17: U, y18=2\n\nt=18: S, y19=2  (stay at y=2 for t=19)\n\nt=19: S, y20=2\n\nt=20: S, y21=2\n\nt=21: D, y22=1\n\nt=22: S, y23=1\n\nt=23: S, y24=1\n\nt=24: S, y25=1\n\nt=25: U, y26=2\n\n... up to t=33: y33=9\n\nStill H=17, and I stayed at y=2 from t=18 to t=20 for 3 turns, then down to y=1.\n\nWorse than before.\n\nFrom t=21 y=2, a21=D, y22=1\n\nThen a22=S, y23=1\n\na23=S, y24=1\n\nSame as first plan.\n\nNo improvement.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 in 10 turns or something, but let's accept H=17 for now.\n\nBut there might be a better way.\n\nAnother thought: at t=18 and 19, y=7 and 8 are unsafe, but I am not there, so no problem.\n\nThe only issue is t=24 and 25.\n\nBut at t=24 and 25, if I can be on y=1, safe, then after that, I can go up fast.\n\nBut to go from y=1 to y=9, it takes 8 turns, reaching at t=33 if start from t=25.\n\nBut the time to reach y=1 can be short.\n\nFor example, go to y=1 at t=17, then stay until t=25, that's long.\n\nGo to y=1 later.\n\nFor example, at t=23, be at y=1.\n\nThen I can be at y=1 at t=23 and t=24 with S.\n\nThen at t=25, I can be at y=2, but unsafe, so must be at y=1 at t=25 also.\n\nSo t=23,24,25 at y=1.\n\nThen go up.\n\nTo be at y=1 at t=23, I can go directly: a16=U, y17=1, then stay from t=17 to t=25 with S actions.\n\na17 to a24 all S, y18 to y25 all 1.\n\nThen a25=U, etc.\n\nSame as before.\n\nOr, I can go up to some point and come down.\n\nFor example, go to y=4 at t=20, then down to y=1 at t=23.\n\nAs in the first sequence.\n\nBut still H=17.\n\nPerhaps I can save one turn by not staying at t=25.\n\nBut at t=25, I need to be on y=1, so I must have an action to stay or be there.\n\nI think 17 is the minimal possible without collision.\n\nBut let's check if I can reach at t=26.\n\nFor example, at t=26, y=9.\n\nThen at t=25, I must be at y=8 or y=9.\n\nIf at y=8, t=25 unsafe.\n\nIf at y=9, then at t=25 y=9, which is safe, but how to be at y=9 at t=25.\n\nFrom start, 9 U, at t=25 y=9, but at t=24 y=8, unsafe.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=9 at t=25 without being at y=8 at t=24.\n\nSimilarly for t=26: to be at y=9 at t=26, at t=25 I must be at y=8,9, or 10 but y<=9, so y=8 or9.\n\nIf at y=9, then at t=25 y=9, safe, but to be at y=9 at t=25, same problem as above.\n\nIf at y=8 at t=25, but t=25 unsafe for y=8.\n\nSo cannot be at y=8 at t=25.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach y=9 at t=25 or 26.\n\nSimilarly, at t=27: to be at y=9 at t=27, at t=26 I must be at y=8 or9.\n\nIf at y=9, then good, but to be at y=9 at t=26, at t=25 must be at y=8 or9, same issue.\n\nIf at y=8 at t=26, which is safe (t=26>25), then a26=U, y27=9.\n\nSo possible.\n\nFor example, be at y=8 at t=26, then go U to y=9 at t=27.\n\nHow to be at y=8 at t=26.\n\nFrom start, with 8 U, at t=24 y=8, but unsafe.\n\nSo I need to delay with stay or down.\n\nFor example, go up to y=7 at t=23, as before.\n\nThen from t=23 y=7, I need to be at y=8 at t=26.\n\n3 turns later.\n\nAt t=23 y=7, I can go down to y=1 for t=24 and 25, then to y=8 at t=26.\n\nBut from y=1 to y=8 takes 7 turns, so at t=26 y=8, then t=27 y=9.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAt t=23 y=7, safe.\n\na23=D, y24=6, but at t=24 y=6, unsafe! Collision.\n\nIf I go down to y=1, but at t=24 I will be on y=6 or5 etc, unsafe.\n\nSo I must go directly to y=1 before t=24.\n\nAs in the first plan.\n\nI think H=17 is the best.\n\nBut let's confirm with the car states.\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother idea: at t=24 and 25, for freeways 2-6, only that one car, but on y=7 and8, there are multiple cars, but the coverage is the same.\n\nOr for y=1, always safe.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=1 at t=24, and at t=25, since I am on y=1, I can go U to y=2, but t=25 unsafe for y=2, so collision.\n\nSo I cannot.\n\nMust stay at y=1 or go to y=0 or9.\n\nSo I think the sequence with H=17 is the way to go.\n\nBut let's write the actions for the first plan I had.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nTurn 16: U  (y17=1)\n\nTurn 17: S  (y18=1)  // stay, but I can U here? No, if I U at t=17, y18=2, then I need to come down later, may not save turns.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=17 I can go U to y=2, but then I have to go down more later to be at y=1 at t=24.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=16: U, y17=1\n\nt=17: U, y18=2\n\nt=18: U, y19=3\n\nt=19: U, y20=4\n\nt=20: D, y21=3\n\nt=21: D, y22=2\n\nt=22: D, y23=1\n\nt=23: S, y24=1\n\nt=24: S, y25=1\n\nt=25: U, y26=2\n\nt=26: U, y27=3\n\nt=27: U, y28=4\n\nt=28: U, y29=5\n\nt=29: U, y30=6\n\nt=30: U, y31=7\n\nt=31: U, y32=8\n\nt=32: U, y33=9\n\nActions from t=16 to t=32, that's 17 actions.\n\nH=17.\n\nThe sequence of actions is a_{16} to a_{32}, 17 actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nt_1=16, so turns 16 to 16+16=32 for actions, position at t=33.\n\nNow for the box.\n\nBut perhaps I can start going up later to reduce the down moves.\n\nFor example, at t=16, I can stay or go U.\n\nIf I stay at y=0 for some turns, then go up, but then I reach y=1 later, and still need to be at y=1 at t=24, so may not help.\n\nFor example, stay at y=0 until t=20, then go up to y=4 at t=24? Let's not.\n\nI think it's optimal.\n\nSo I'll go with this.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=19 I have U to y=4, then down, etc.\n\nTo make it cleaner, I can stay at y=1 from t=17 to t=25 except for the down moves, but in this case, I have down moves from y=4 to y=1.\n\nBut let's list the actions as per the task.\n\nThe task is to output the sequence of actions from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H-1.\n\nWith H=17.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U  // I can have U here, but in above I had S, but let's have U to go faster initially.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=17 I have U, y18=2.\n\nThen at t=18 U, y19=3\n\nt=19 U, y20=4\n\nt=20 D, y21=3\n\nt=21 D, y22=2\n\nt=22 D, y23=1\n\nt=23 S, y24=1\n\nt=24 S, y25=1\n\nt=25 U, y26=2\n\nt=26 U, y27=3\n\nt=27 U, y28=4\n\nt=28 U, y29=5\n\nt=29 U, y30=6\n\nt=30 U, y31=7\n\nt=31 U, y32=8\n\nt=32 U, y33=9\n\nYes.\n\nTo save one turn, at t=23, instead of S, I can do something else, but I need y24=1, so if I do S, y24=1.\n\nIf I do D, y24=0, but y=0 is also safe, then at t=24 y=0, a24=U, y25=1, but at t=25 y=1, safe, then a25=U, y26=2, etc, same number of turns.\n\nReach at t=33 still.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 17.\n\nBut let's confirm if with this, no collision.\n\nPositions:\n\nt=16: y=0, not freeway\n\nt=17: y=1, freeway1, safe\n\nt=18: y=2, freeway2, safe (t=18 not 24,25)\n\nt=19: y=3, safe\n\nt=20: y=4, safe\n\nt=21: y=3, freeway3, safe (t=21 not 24,25)\n\nt=22: y=2, freeway2, safe\n\nt=23: y=1, freeway1, safe\n\nt=24: y=1, freeway1, safe\n\nt=25: y=1, freeway1, safe\n\nt=26: y=2, freeway2, safe (t=26>25)\n\nt=27: y=3, safe\n\nt=28: y=4, safe\n\nt=29: y=5, safe\n\nt=30: y=6, safe\n\nt=31: y=7, safe (t=31>25)\n\nt=32: y=8, safe\n\nt=33: y=9, not freeway, goal.\n\nAll safe.\n\nAnd H=17.\n\nBut is there a way with H=16?\n\nSuppose reach at t=32, y32=9.\n\nThen y32=9, so at t=31, y31=8 or 9.\n\nIf y31=9, then at t=31 position, but to be at y=9 at t=31, at t=30 must be y=8 or9.\n\nSimilarly, must have been at y=8 at some point.\n\nBut at t=24 or 25, if I am at y=8, unsafe.\n\nThe safe times for y=8 are t=20-23 or t>=26.\n\nt=20-23: for example, at t=23, I can be at y=7, not 8.\n\nAt t=26, I can be at y=8.\n\nThen a26=U, y27=9, reach at t=27.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=26.\n\nFrom start, with delays.\n\nFor example, go up to y=7 at t=23.\n\nt=23 y=7.\n\nThen from t=23 to t=26, 3 turns.\n\nI need to avoid t=24 and 25 on freeway.\n\nBut at t=24, I must be on y=1 or 0.\n\nFrom y=7 at t=23, I can go down, but in one step to y=6 at t=24, unsafe.\n\nCannot reach y=1 in one step.\n\nSo impossible to be at safe position at t=24 from y=7 at t=23.\n\nTherefore, must be at low y at t=23 or earlier.\n\nThus H=17 seems minimal.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 16\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the player must follow a sequence of actions that ensures they are not on any unsafe freeway during unsafe times. The unsafe times for each freeway are derived from the car states at turn 16:\n\n- Freeway 1 is always safe.\n- Freeways 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are unsafe at turns 24 and 25.\n- Freeway 7 is unsafe at turns 18, 19, 24, and 25.\n- Freeway 8 is unsafe at turns 18, 19, 24, and 25.\n\nThe critical unsafe periods are turns 24 and 25, where freeways 2 to 8 are unsafe, except freeway 1. To avoid collision, the player must be on freeway 1 (y=1) or at a non-freeway position (y=0 or y=9) during turns 24 and 25. The minimal path involves:\n- Moving up to y=4 by turn 20 to progress efficiently.\n- Then moving down to y=1 by turn 23 to be safe during turns 24 and 25.\n- Staying at y=1 during turns 24 and 25.\n- After turn 25, moving up directly to y=9, as all freeways are safe after turn 25.\n\nThis sequence requires 17 turns (actions from turn 16 to turn 32), reaching y=9 at turn 33. The actions are chosen to minimize turns while ensuring safety:\n- Turns 16-19: Move up to y=4.\n- Turns 20-22: Move down to y=1.\n- Turns 23-24: Stay at y=1 to avoid unsafe freeways at turns 24 and 25.\n- Turn 25: Stay at y=1 for safety at turn 25.\n- Turns 26-32: Move up to y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: D \\\\\nTurn 21: D \\\\\nTurn 22: D \\\\\nTurn 23: S \\\\\nTurn 24: S \\\\\nTurn 25: S \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: U \\\\\nTurn 28: U \\\\\nTurn 29: U \\\\\nTurn 30: U \\\\\nTurn 31: U \\\\\nTurn 32: U\n}",

Collision happens only if at the turn when I'm on a freeway, the car's span includes 0 at that exact turn.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. All cars are moving right, according to the table. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)], where t₁ is 21.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t₁, so for each car, the span at time T is:\n\nFor a car with head h, tail τ, speed s, right-moving:\n\nLeft end: τ + s * Δt\n\nRight end: h + s * Δt\n\nAnd collision occurs if y_T = k (the freeway) and 0 is between left end and right end inclusive, I assume, since it's a span.\n\nThe problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd Span(T) is [left, right] for the car at that time.\n\nAlso, note that when I move, I'm not on the new freeway until the next turn. Specifically, if I move at turn T to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, I'm not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I don't check collision for y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nNow, my position: I start at y=3 at turn t₁=21.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by +1 (U), -1 (D), or 0 (S), but y is clamped between 0 and 9.\n\nSince I'm going up, from 3 to 9, I need to go up 6 units, so minimum moves if I go up every turn would be 6 turns, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 6.\n\nBut I need the minimal H.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions over time.\n\nt₁ = 21\n\nFor each freeway, there are cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-12, -23, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (-18, -29, right, 6)\n\nSimilarly, freeways 3,4,5,6 each have one car: (-18, -29, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (-18, -29, right, 6), (18, 7, right, 6), (54, 43, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7: (-18, -29, right, 6), (18, 7, right, 6), (54, 43, right, 6)\n\nNow, for each car, the span at time T is:\n\nLet Δt = T - 21\n\nFor freeway 1 car: h=-12, τ=-23, s=12, right-moving\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] = [-23 + 12Δt, -12 + 12Δt]\n\nCollision if y_T=1 and 0 is in that interval.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI need to find when 0 is in the span for each car on its freeway.\n\nSince collision depends on whether 0 is in span at the exact turn when I'm on that freeway.\n\nI need to plan my path: sequence of y positions.\n\nStart at t=21, y=3.\n\nAt each turn T, I choose action, which sets y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I am at y_T, and I might be on a freeway that has cars, so I need to ensure that for that freeway k=y_T, no car has 0 in span at time T.\n\nThen I move to y_{T+1}.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, because cars are only on y=1 to 8, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe, but I need to be at (0,9), which is the position.\n\ny=9 is the top, no cars, so no collision possible there.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe, but I'm starting from 3, going to 9, so probably won't go to 0.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when a car is at 0.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, at which times 0 is covered by a car.\n\nThat is, for each k, find the set of T where if I am on freeway k at turn T, I collide with a car.\n\nBut for each freeway, there might be multiple cars, so I need if any car has 0 in span at time T.\n\nSo let's do that for each freeway.\n\nStart with freeway 1: only one car.\n\nSpan: [-23 + 12Δt, -12 + 12Δt] with Δt = T - 21\n\n0 is in [left, right] if left <= 0 <= right\n\nSo -23 + 12Δt <= 0 <= -12 + 12Δt\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst, -23 + 12Δt <= 0 => 12Δt <= 23 => Δt <= 23/12 = 1.9166, so Δt <= 1 since turns are integer, Δt integer.\n\nT is turn number, so Δt integer.\n\nΔt = T - 21, integer.\n\nSo -23 + 12Δt <= 0 => 12Δt <= 23 => Δt <= 23/12 = 1.916, so Δt <= 1\n\nAnd 0 <= -12 + 12Δt => 12 <= 12Δt => Δt >= 1\n\nAlso, since it's inclusive, we need both.\n\nSo Δt >=1 and Δt <=1, so Δt=1\n\nThus, only at Δt=1, which is T=22, the span is [-23+12= -11, -12+12=0], so 0 is included.\n\nAt T=21, Δt=0, span [-23, -12], 0 not in.\n\nT=22, Δt=1, [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11, 0], 0 is right end, so included.\n\nT=23, Δt=2, [-23+24=1, -12+24=12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision only at T=22.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nSpan: [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] = [-29 + 6Δt, -18 + 6Δt]\n\n0 in span if -29 + 6Δt <= 0 <= -18 + 6Δt\n\nLeft: -29 + 6Δt <= 0 => 6Δt <= 29 => Δt <= 29/6 ≈ 4.833, so Δt <= 4\n\nRight: 0 <= -18 + 6Δt => 18 <= 6Δt => Δt >= 3\n\nSo Δt >=3 and Δt <=4\n\nThus T=21+3=24, and T=21+4=25\n\nAt T=24, Δt=3, span [-29+18= -11, -18+18=0], 0 in\n\nT=25, Δt=4, span [-29+24= -5, -18+24=6], 0 in since -5<=0<=6\n\nT=26, Δt=5, [-29+30=1, -18+30=12], 0 not in\n\nSo collision at T=24 and T=25.\n\nFreeway 3: same car as freeway 2? No, freeway 3 has its own car, but same parameters: (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nSimilarly, so same as freeway 2: collision at T=24 and T=25.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4,5,6: each has one car (-18,-29,right,6), so all have collision at T=24 and T=25.\n\nNow freeway 7: multiple cars.\n\nFirst car: (-18,-29,right,6) same as above, so collision when Δt=3 or 4, T=24,25\n\nSecond car: (18,7,right,6)\n\nHead h=18, tail τ=7? Span is given as (head, tail, dir, speed)\n\nIn the table: for freeway 7, cars: (-18,-29,right,6), (18,7,right,6), (54,43,right,6)\n\nFor second car: head=18, tail=7, but for right-moving, tail should be left, head right, so if head=18, tail=7, that means from 7 to 18, so left=7, right=18.\n\nIn the update: for right-moving, span at T: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nτ is tail, h is head.\n\nSo for this car, τ=7, h=18, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [7 + 6Δt, 18 + 6Δt]\n\n0 in span? 7 + 6Δt <= 0 <= 18 + 6Δt?\n\nBut 7 + 6Δt >=7 >0 for Δt>=0, so left end >=7>0, so 0 cannot be <= left end, so 0 never in span. Similarly, right end >=18>0, so 0 not in [7+6Δt, 18+6Δt] for any Δt>=0.\n\nSo this car never covers 0.\n\nThird car: (54,43,right,6), τ=43, h=54, s=6\n\nSpan [43+6Δt, 54+6Δt], both ends positive and increasing, min 43>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nTherefore, for freeway 7, only the first car matters, which causes collision at T=24 and T=25, same as others.\n\nFirst car is (-18,-29,right,6), so yes, collision at T=24,25.\n\nNow freeway 8: same as freeway 7: (-18,-29,right,6), (18,7,right,6), (54,43,right,6)\n\nSimilarly, only the first car causes collision at T=24,25, others never cover 0.\n\nSo summary for each freeway when collision happens:\n\nFreeway 1: only at T=22\n\nFreeway 2: T=24,25\n\nFreeway 3: T=24,25\n\nFreeway 4: T=24,25\n\nFreeway 5: T=24,25\n\nFreeway 6: T=24,25\n\nFreeway 7: T=24,25\n\nFreeway 8: T=24,25\n\nAnd no other times? For freeway 1, only T=22, for others T=24,25.\n\nBut freeway 1 has no collision at other times, and similarly for others.\n\nNow, I start at t=21, y=3.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=3 at t=21.\n\nFirst, at t=21, I am on freeway y=3.\n\nFreeway 3 has collision only at T=24 and 25.\n\nAt t=21, Δt=0, for freeway 3 car: span [-29, -18], 0 not in, so no collision at t=21.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but I'm on y=3, so only need to check y=3 at that time.\n\nAt turn T, I only care about the freeway I am on, y_T.\n\nSo at t=21, y=3, freeway 3: no collision, since not T=24 or 25.\n\nNow, I need to move to higher y.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nI should go up.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, I just need to be there.\n\nThe issue is the intermediate freeways.\n\nNow, the critical times are T=22 for y=1, and T=24,25 for all y=2 to 8 except y=1 only at T=22.\n\ny=1 has collision only at T=22, but I'm starting from y=3, so I might not go to y=1.\n\nBut I could go down, but probably not necessary.\n\nNow, to go from y=3 to y=9, minimum 6 up moves.\n\nBut I might need to avoid being on certain freeways at critical times.\n\nSpecifically, at T=24 and T=25, all freeways from 2 to 8 have collision, so I must not be on any of y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8 at T=24 or T=25.\n\nBecause for each, if I am on that freeway, I collide.\n\nNow, at T=22, only y=1 has collision, so I can be on other freeways except y=1 at T=22.\n\nBut since I'm at y=3 now, I might not be affected.\n\nNow, let's think about the timeline.\n\nt=21: I am at y=3, safe.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nSince at t=24 and t=25, I cannot be on y=2 to 8, I must be on y=0, or y=9, or y=1? y=1 has collision only at t=22, not at t=24,25.\n\ny=1: collision only at t=22.\n\nAt t=24 and t=25, y=1 is safe, because no collision except at t=22.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 and y=9 always safe, no cars.\n\nSo at t=24 and t=25, I must be on y=0, y=1, or y=9 to avoid collision.\n\nNow, y=9 is the goal, so if I can be there by t=24 or earlier, good, but let's see.\n\nt=21: y=3\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nEach up move increases y by 1.\n\nIf I go up every turn, I can be at y=4 at t=22, y=5 at t=23, y=6 at t=24, but at t=24, if I am at y=6, I collide because freeway 6 has collision at t=24.\n\nSimilarly, if I reach y=9 at t=27? Let's see.\n\nt=21: y=3\n\nAfter one up: t=22, y=4\n\nBut at t=22, I need to check where I am.\n\nAt turn t=22, I am at y=4? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T, I start at position (0, y_T), I choose action a_T, then I move to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nBut at turn T, I am at y_T, and that's when I might collide if on a freeway with car at 0.\n\nSo for turn T, position y_T.\n\nt=21: y=3, safe as above.\n\nI choose action a_{21}, which determines y_{22}.\n\nSuppose I go up: a_{21} = U, then y_{22} = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nNow turn t=22: I am at y=4\n\nAt t=22, freeway y=4: does it have collision? Freeway 4 has collision only at t=24 and 25, not at t=22. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 has collision at t=22, but I'm not on y=1.\n\nSo at t=22, y=4, safe.\n\nThen I can go up again: a_{22} = U, y_{23} = 5\n\nt=23: at y=5, freeway 5 collision only at t=24,25, not t=23, so safe.\n\nThen a_{23} = U, y_{24} = 6\n\nNow turn t=24: at y=6, freeway 6 has collision at t=24, so I collide! Not good.\n\nIf I go up, I arrive at y=6 at t=24, which is bad.\n\nAt t=23, y=5, I could stay or go down.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince I cannot be on y=2-8 at t=24 and t=25, I need to be on y=0,1, or 9 at those times.\n\ny=9 is the goal.\n\nNow, from y=3 at t=21, to reach y=9, I need at least 6 up moves.\n\nBut with the constraints.\n\nI could delay or go down to avoid being on critical freeways at critical times.\n\nt=24 and t=25 are the critical turns.\n\nI need to not be on y=2-8 during those turns.\n\nSo for t=24 and t=25, I must be on y=0,1, or 9.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, which has no collision except at t=22, so at t=24 and t=25, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nNow, I start at t=21, y=3.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be more than 6.\n\nLet me list possible y at each turn.\n\nt=21: y=3, must be here, start.\n\nt=22: I can be at y=2,3,4 depending on action.\n\nIf I go down: a= D, y=2\n\nStay: S, y=3\n\nUp: U, y=4\n\nBut at t=22, if I am on y=1, I collide, but I cannot be on y=1 at t=22 because to be on y=1 at t=22, I would have come from y=0 or y=2 at t=21, but I start at y=3, so at t=22, I can be at y=2,3,4, not y=1 directly.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=21, if I go down, y=2 at t=22; if stay, y=3; if up, y=4. So y=1 not possible at t=22. Similarly, y=0 or 5 not possible in one step. So at t=22, possible y:2,3,4.\n\nNow at t=22, for y=2,3,4: all are freeways 2,3,4.\n\nFreeway 2: collision at t=24,25, not t=22, so safe.\n\nFreeway 3 and 4 same.\n\nSo all safe at t=22.\n\nt=23: from previous, depending on action.\n\nIf at t=22 y=2, I can go to y=1,2,3\n\nIf y=3, to y=2,3,4\n\nIf y=4, to y=3,4,5\n\nBut at t=23, for any y=1 to 8, is there collision?\n\nFreeway 1: collision only t=22, not t=23\n\nFreeway 2-8: collision at t=24,25, not t=23.\n\nSo all freeways safe at t=23.\n\nt=24: critical, cannot be on y=2-8.\n\nMust be on y=0,1,9.\n\nBut from t=23, I can only reach y from 0 to 9, but depending on position.\n\nSimilarly t=25 critical.\n\nt=26: after critical, should be ok.\n\nFirst, I need to be at y=0,1, or 9 at t=24 and t=25.\n\nSince y=9 is the goal, if I can reach it by t=24, then at t=25 I'm still at y=9 or something, but I need to reach exactly.\n\nThe position when I reach y=9, I am there at that turn.\n\nBut since y=9 has no cars, I can stay there or whatever.\n\nBut for t=24 and t=25, I need to be safe.\n\nNow, from y=3 at t=21, to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nLet me see how early I can reach y=9.\n\nIf no obstacles, from y=3, 6 up moves: at t=21 y=3, t=22 y=4, t=23 y=5, t=24 y=6, but at t=24 y=6 collide.\n\nt=25 y=7, collide, t=26 y=8, but at t=26, y=8: freeway 8 collision only at t=24,25, not at t=26? At t=26, for freeway 8, Δt=5, span for the car: [-29+30=1, -18+30=12] for the first car, 0 not in, other cars don't cover, so safe. Similarly for others.\n\nBut at t=24 and 25, I collide if on y=2-8.\n\nIn the direct path: t=24 y=6 collide, so I need to avoid that.\n\nSo I need to not be on y=2-8 at t=24 and t=25.\n\nTherefore, for t=24, I must be on y=0,1, or 9.\n\nSimilarly for t=25.\n\nNow, y=9 is the goal, so if I reach y=9 at or before t=24, I'm safe.\n\nBut from t=21 y=3, to y=9, need 6 up moves, so earliest at t=27 if I start moving at t=21.\n\nt=21: start y=3\n\nAfter first up: t=22 y=4\n\nSecond up: t=23 y=5\n\nThird up: t=24 y=6 → but collide at t=24\n\nIf I go up faster? I can only change by 1 per turn, so minimum 6 turns from t=21 to reach y=9, so arrive at t=26 if I go up every turn: t=21 y=3, t=22 y=4, t=23 y=5, t=24 y=6 (collide), t=25 y=7 (collide if on y=7 at t=25), t=26 y=8 (safe, but not 9), t=27 y=9.\n\nBut at t=24 and t=25 I collide if I go straight.\n\nSo I need to be at safe y at t=24 and t=25.\n\nSafe y: 0,1,9\n\ny=9 requires 6 up moves from y=3, so I can be at y=9 at earliest t=26? t=21 y=3, after 6 up moves: at turn t=27, y=9, because:\n\nAt turn t, after action, y_{t} is position.\n\nt=21: y=3 (initial)\n\nAfter action a21, y22 set.\n\ny at turn T is the position at the start of turn T.\n\nTo have y=9 at turn T, I need to arrive there at T.\n\nFrom y=3, to y=9, I need to increase by 6, so after 6 up actions, I reach y=9.\n\nEach up action increases y by 1 at the next turn.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t=21: start y=3, choose a21, go to y22 = y3 + Δy\n\nThen at turn t=22, y= y22, and so on.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn T, I need that y_T =9.\n\nFor example, if I do U at t=21, t=22, ..., up to t=26, then:\n\nt=21: y=3, a=U, y22=4\n\nt=22: y=4, a=U, y23=5\n\nt=23: y=5, a=U, y24=6\n\nt=24: y=6, a=U, y25=7\n\nt=25: y=7, a=U, y26=8\n\nt=26: y=8, a=U, y27=9\n\nThen at t=27: y=9, which is safe.\n\nBut at t=24, y=6, collide; t=25, y=7, collide.\n\nSo I need to avoid that.\n\nI could reach y=9 earlier if I start from lower, but I start from 3.\n\nMinimal turns to reach y=9 from y=3 is 6 actions, so 6 turns after start, at t=27.\n\nBut I can reach earlier if I go up faster, but I can't, only +1 per turn.\n\nAnother way: I could be at y=1 or y=0 at t=24 and t=25 to be safe.\n\ny=0 or y=1.\n\nFor example, from y=3, I can go down to y=2 or stay, but I need to go to y=0 or 1 by t=24.\n\nt=24 is only 3 turns from t=21.\n\nt=21 to t=24 is 3 turns: t=21,22,23 actions affect y at t=24.\n\nAt turn t=24, y_{24} is determined by actions from t=21 to t=23.\n\nSimilarly, y_{25} by actions t=21 to t=24, but let's focus on being safe at t=24 and t=25.\n\nFirst, at t=24, I need y_{24} = 0,1, or 9.\n\nSimilarly for t=25.\n\nBut y=9 might not be reachable by t=24, since from y=3, in 3 actions, I can increase y by at most 3, to y=6, not 9.\n\nSimilarly, I can decrease.\n\nAt t=21: y=3\n\nAfter three actions, at t=24, y_{24} can be from y=3-3=0 to y=3+3=6, so y=0 to 6 possible at t=24.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 not possible at t=24.\n\nSo at t=24, I must be at y=0 or y=1 to be safe.\n\nSimilarly for t=25.\n\nNow y=1 at t=24: is it safe? Freeway 1 has collision only at t=22, not at t=24, so yes, safe.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nNow for t=25, similarly, y=0 or 1 or 9.\n\ny=9 might be possible later.\n\nNow, I also need to reach y=9 eventually.\n\nSo strategy: I need to be at y=0 or 1 at t=24 and t=25.\n\nThen after that, go up to y=9.\n\nBut at t=25, if I am at y=1, I can go up to y=2 at t=26, etc.\n\nBut let's see the actions.\n\nFirst, from t=21 to reach y=0 or 1 at t=24.\n\nt=24 y must be 0 or 1.\n\nCurrent y=3 at t=21.\n\nTo decrease to 1 or 0 in 3 steps.\n\nI can do down actions.\n\nFor example, go down twice and stay once or something.\n\nLet me define the actions.\n\nSet t=21: start y=3\n\nI need to choose actions so that at t=24, y=0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, at t=25, y=0 or 1.\n\nBut since I will be at same y if I stay, or change.\n\nNow, from t=21 to t=24:\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1.\n\nNet change in y from t=21 to t=24 is Δy = (y24 - y21) determined by actions at t=21,22,23.\n\ny24 = y21 + sum_{t=21 to 23} Δy_t\n\ny21=3\n\ny24 = 3 + Δy21 + Δy22 + Δy23\n\nΔy each is -1,0,1\n\nSo y24 between 0 and 6.\n\nI need y24 = 0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, for t=25, y25 = y24 + Δy24\n\nBut first, let's get to t=24.\n\nNow, during the path, I need to avoid collision at each turn.\n\nAt t=22 and t=23, as we saw earlier, all freeways are safe except at t=22 y=1, but I won't be at y=1 at t=22 probably.\n\nSo let's plan to be at y=1 at t=24.\n\ny=1 at t=24.\n\nThen at t=25, I can stay or go down to y=0, but y=1 is safe at t=25, since no collision.\n\nThen from there go up to 9.\n\nFirst, to reach y=1 at t=24 from y=3 at t=21.\n\nThat means I need to decrease by 2 in 3 steps.\n\nSo possible sequences of actions for t=21,22,23.\n\ny24 = 3 + Δy21 + Δy22 + Δy23 =1\n\nSo Δy21 + Δy22 + Δy23 = -2\n\nEach Δy = -1,0,1\n\nSo sum to -2 in 3 steps.\n\nPossibilities:\n\n- Two down and one stay: e.g., D,D,S in some order.\n\n- Or one down and two down? Two down and one stay: net -2.\n\nOr three down, net -3, too low.\n\nOr one down, one up, one down? Down, up, down: -1 +1 -1 = -1, not -2.\n\nTo get net -2:\n\n- Two down and one stay: e.g., D,D,S or D,S,D or S,D,D\n\n- Or three down: D,D,D, net -3, y24=0\n\nBut I need y=0 or 1.\n\nNow, also need to avoid being on y=1 at t=22, because collision.\n\nBut at t=22, if I am on y=1, I collide.\n\nSo in the path, I must not be at y=1 at turn t=22.\n\nSimilarly, at other times, but t=22 is the only critical for y=1.\n\nNow, let's consider the actions.\n\nStart t=21: y=3\n\nChoose a21, then y22 = 3 + Δy21\n\nThen at t=22: position y22\n\nThen choose a22, y23 = y22 + Δy22\n\nt=23: y23, choose a23, y24 = y23 + Δy23\n\nNow, y24 must be 0 or 1.\n\nAnd at t=22, y22 must not be 1, to avoid collision.\n\nSimilarly, at t=23, no issue, since all safe.\n\nNow, y22 = 3 + Δy21\n\nΔy21: if U, y22=4; D, y22=2; S, y22=3\n\nNone is 1, so y22 cannot be 1, since from 3, to 2,3,4. So impossible to be at y=1 at t=22, so no problem, collision at y=1 t=22 cannot happen for me, since I start from y=3.\n\nSimilarly, I can only reach y=1 at later turns if I go down.\n\nSo for t=22, y22 is 2,3, or 4, all safe as established.\n\nNow, back to reaching y=1 at t=24.\n\ny24 = 3 + Δy21 + Δy22 + Δy23 =1\n\nSo Δy21 + Δy22 + Δy23 = -2\n\nWith each in {-1,0,1}\n\nPossible: two D and one S, or three D.\n\nCase 1: three down actions: a21=D, a22=D, a23=D\n\nThen y22=3-1=2\n\ny23=2-1=1\n\ny24=1-1=0\n\nAt t=23, y=1? y23=1, at turn t=23.\n\nFreeway y=1 at t=23: collision? Earlier, freeway 1 collision only at t=22, not t=23, so safe.\n\nThen at t=24, y=0, which is safe.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, no cars, so always safe.\n\nThen at t=25, I need to be safe, y=0 or 1 or 9.\n\ny=0 at t=24, I can choose action.\n\nIf I stay, a24=S, then y25=0, safe.\n\nOr go up, y25=1, also safe at t=25.\n\nNow, but I need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom t=24 y=0 or 1.\n\nBut y=0 at t=24.\n\nThen I can go up to y=9.\n\nBut let's see if I can be at y=1 at t=24.\n\nWith two down and one stay.\n\nFor example, a21=D, a22=D, a23=S\n\nThen y22=3-1=2\n\ny23=2-1=1? a22=D, from y22=2, a22=D, y23=2-1=1\n\nThen a23=S, y24=1+0=1\n\nAt t=23, y=1, which is safe as above.\n\nt=24 y=1, safe.\n\nOther sequences.\n\nBut with three downs: y24=0.\n\nNow, for t=25, if I am at y=0 or 1 at t=24, I can stay or move to keep safe at t=25.\n\nThen after t=25, I can go up to y=9.\n\nNow, the critical period is over at t=26.\n\nt=26 and later, all freeways safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nFor example, freeway 2-8: collision only at t=24,25, so at t=26, no collision.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo after t=25, I can freely move up to y=9.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible after t=25.\n\nH is the number of turns to reach y=9, meaning the turn when I first am at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, when y_T=9 for some T.\n\nNow, from t=24 or t=25, I am at low y, say y=0 or 1.\n\nThen to y=9, I need 9 or 8 up moves.\n\nBut since I can start from t=24.\n\nLet's list a full sequence.\n\nFirst, option: go down to be at y=0 or 1 at t=24.\n\nFor example, with three downs:\n\nt=21: y=3, a=D, go to y=2\n\nt=22: y=2, a=D, go to y=1\n\nt=23: y=1, a=D, go to y=0\n\nt=24: y=0, which is safe.\n\nNow at t=24, I need to choose action for t=25.\n\nt=24: y=0, I can do U, to go to y=1, or S to stay y=0, or D but y=0, D would go to y=0 since min 0, but Δy=-1, y=0-1 not possible, so y stays 0? The dynamics: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y in [0,9], so if y_t=0 and a=D, y_{t+1} = max(0, 0-1)=0? Or min max.\n\nIt says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if y_t=0 and D, y_{t+1} = max(0, 0-1) =0.\n\nSimilarly, if y_t=9 and U, y_{t+1}=9.\n\nSo at t=24, y=0, if I do D or S, y25=0.\n\nIf U, y25=1.\n\nNow, at t=25, I need to be safe, y=0 or 1 or 9.\n\ny=0 or 1 both safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I do U, y25=1, also safe.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nTo minimize H, I should go up as much as possible.\n\nNow, from t=24 y=0.\n\nIf I go up every turn:\n\nt=24: y=0, a=U, y25=1\n\nt=25: y=1, a=U, y26=2\n\nt=26: y=2, a=U, y27=3\n\nt=27: y=3, a=U, y28=4\n\nt=28: y=4, a=U, y29=5\n\nt=29: y=5, a=U, y30=6\n\nt=30: y=6, a=U, y31=7\n\nt=31: y=7, a=U, y32=8\n\nt=32: y=8, a=U, y33=9\n\nThen at t=33, y=9.\n\nBut this is long because I went down to 0.\n\nFrom t=24 y=0 to y=9, need 9 up moves, so at t=33.\n\nBut I can be at y=1 at t=24.\n\nFor example, with actions: to have y24=1.\n\nAs before, two down and one stay.\n\nFor instance: a21=D, a22=D, a23=S\n\nt=21: y=3, a=D, y22=2\n\nt=22: y=2, a=D, y23=1\n\nt=23: y=1, a=S, y24=1\n\nAt t=23, y=1, safe as Δt=2, not 22.\n\nt=24: y=1, safe.\n\nNow, from here, at t=24, y=1, I can go up.\n\nt=24: y=1, a=U, y25=2\n\nBut at t=25, y=2? t=25 is critical, y=2 has collision at t=25!\n\nFreeway 2 collision at t=25.\n\nIf I go to y=2 at t=25, I collide.\n\nMistake.\n\nAt t=24, y=1, if I do U, then at turn t=25, I am at y=2, but t=25, freeway 2 collision, so I die.\n\nIf I stay at t=24, a=S, then y25=1, safe.\n\nBut then I need to go up later.\n\nSo better to stay at t=24.\n\nt=24: y=1, a=S, y25=1 (since S, Δy=0)\n\nThen t=25: y=1, safe.\n\nThen from t=25, y=1, I can go up.\n\nt=25: y=1, a=U, y26=2\n\nt=26: y=2, a=U, y27=3\n\n...\n\nup to y=9.\n\nFrom y=1 to y=9, need 8 up moves.\n\nt=25: y=1, after U, t=26 y=2\n\nt=26 y=2, U, t=27 y=3\n\n...\nt=32 y=8, U, t=33 y=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut earlier with three downs, I was at y=0 at t=24.\n\nThen from y=0:\n\nt=24: y=0, a=U, y25=1\n\nt=25: y=1, a=U, y26=2\n\nsame as above, to t=33 y=9.\n\nBut at t=25, I am at y=1, which is fine.\n\nCan I reach y=9 faster?\n\nFor example, if I don't go all the way down.\n\nBut at t=24, I need to be at y=0 or 1, which are low.\n\ny=1 at t=24.\n\nFrom t=21 y=3, to y=1 at t=24, I used 3 turns to go down to 1, net decrease 2.\n\nThen from t=24 y=1 to y=9, need 8 turns, so total from t=21 to t=33, 12 turns? Turns from t=21 to t=33 is 12 turns, but I start at t=21, after H turns, I am at y=9 at turn t_1 + H, I think.\n\nLet's define.\n\nI start at turn t_1=21, position (0,y) with y=3.\n\nAfter H turns, meaning after H actions, I am at turn t_1 + H, position (0,9).\n\nAt turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, after actions from t=21 to t=21+H-1, I set y at t=21+H to 9.\n\nThe actions are for turns t=21 to t=21+H-1.\n\nAnd at turn t=21+H, I am at y=9.\n\nNow, the minimal H such that I can achieve this without collision in between.\n\nIn the above, with going to y=1 at t=24, which is t=21+3, so at t=24, I am at y=1.\n\nThen from t=24 to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\ny=9 requires from y=1, 8 up moves.\n\nSo actions from t=24 to t=24+7=31? Let's see:\n\nAt turn t=24, y=1\n\nAfter first U: t=25, y=2\n\nBut at t=25, if y=2, I collide because t=25 critical for y=2.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt t=24, I am at y=1.\n\nIf I do U at t=24, y25=2\n\nThen at turn t=25, I am at y=2, which is freeway 2, and at t=25, collision occurs, since 0 in span.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=2 at t=25.\n\nSimilarly, any y=2 to 8 at t=25 collide.\n\nSo at t=25, I must be at y=0,1,9.\n\nIn this case, at t=24 y=1, if I do U, I go to y=2 at t=25, which is bad.\n\nIf I do S at t=24, y25=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=25 y=1, I can do U, to y=2 at t=26.\n\nt=26 is safe for all, as critical over.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nt=24: y=1, a=S, y25=1\n\nt=25: y=1, a=U, y26=2\n\nt=26: y=2, a=U, y27=3\n\nt=27: y=3, a=U, y28=4\n\nt=28: y=4, a=U, y29=5\n\nt=29: y=5, a=U, y30=6\n\nt=30: y=6, a=U, y31=7\n\nt=31: y=7, a=U, y32=8\n\nt=32: y=8, a=U, y33=9\n\nAt t=33, y=9.\n\nH = number of actions from t=21 to t=32, so H=12? Turns: actions at t=21 to t=32 for 12 actions, to reach at t=33.\n\nBut t=21 is turn 0 of the sequence? Let's clarify.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t=21 to t=21+H-1, and at turn t=21+H, y=9.\n\nSo for example, above, if at t=33 y=9, that means actions from t=21 to t=32, so H actions: t=21 to t=21+H-1, so t=21+H-1=32, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nAnd t=21+H=33.\n\nBut this seems long. Can I do better?\n\nPerhaps I can be at a higher y after the critical period.\n\nOr avoid going down so much.\n\nAnother idea: I could go up to y=4 or 5 before t=24, but I cannot be on y=2-8 at t=24, so I need to jump to y=0 or 1 or 9, but 9 not possible.\n\nSo must go down.\n\nBut let's see if I can be at y=1 at t=24 and t=25, then go up fast after.\n\nBut from y=1, I need 8 up moves, minimum 8 turns.\n\nFrom t=24, after 8 up moves, at t=24+8=32, y=9 at t=32? Let's see:\n\nAt t=24, y=1\n\nAfter action a24, y25 set.\n\nIf I do U at t=24, but I can't because y25=2 at t=25 collide.\n\nSo I must do S at t=24 to stay at y=1 for t=25.\n\nt=24: a=S, y25=1\n\nt=25: a=U, y26=2\n\nt=26: a=U, y27=3\n\n...\nt=32: a=U, y33=9\n\nSo y=9 at t=33.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt t=25, I am at y=1, I can do U to go to y=2 at t=26.\n\nBut t=26 is safe.\n\nNow, to save time, I could have been at a higher y before t=24.\n\nFor example, at t=23, what can I be.\n\nt=23: y23 can be from 0 to 6, as before.\n\nBut at t=23, all positions are safe, since no collision at t=23 for any freeway.\n\nThen from t=23, I need to be at safe y at t=24.\n\nFor example, at t=23, if I am at y=1, then I can go to y=1 or y=2 or y=0 at t=24.\n\nBut at t=24, y=2 is not safe, so I need to go to y=1 or y=0.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=23 y=2, I can go to y=1,2,3, but for t=24, only y=1 or 0 safe, so I can go down to y=1.\n\nBut y=1 at t=24 is safe.\n\nIf at t=23 I am at higher y, say y=5, then to be safe at t=24, I need to go down to y=0 or 1, but from y=5, in one action, I can go to y=4,5,6, none of which are 0 or 1, so I cannot reach y=0 or 1 in one step from y=5.\n\nSo at t=24, I would be at y=4,5, or 6, all unsafe, collide.\n\nTherefore, to be safe at t=24, I must be at y<=1 at t=23, so that I can be at y=0 or 1 at t=24.\n\ny at t=23 must be such that I can reach y=0 or 1 with one action.\n\nSo from y23, with one action, to y24=0 or 1.\n\nIf y23=0, I can do S or D to stay at 0, or U to 1.\n\nIf y23=1, I can do D to 0, S to 1, U to 2.\n\nIf y23=2, I can do D to 1, S to 2, U to 3.\n\nSo to have y24=0 or 1, I need y23 <=2, because if y23=2, I can do D to y24=1; if y23=1, to 0 or 1; if y23=0, to 0 or 1.\n\nIf y23=3, I can go to y24=2,3,4, none 0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly higher.\n\nSo for y24 to be 0 or 1, I must have y23 <=2.\n\nSimilarly, for t=25, but let's first ensure t=24.\n\nSo at t=23, I must have y23 <=2.\n\nThen from there, I can go to y24=0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, for t=25, I need y25=0,1,9.\n\nBut y=9 not possible yet.\n\nNow from t=21 y=3, to have y23 <=2.\n\nIn two actions: from t=21 to t=23.\n\ny23 = y21 + Δy21 + Δy22 = 3 + Δy21 + Δy22\n\nNeed y23 <=2.\n\nSo 3 + Δy21 + Δy22 <=2, so Δy21 + Δy22 <= -1\n\nEach Δy = -1,0,1, so possible if at least one down.\n\nFor example, a21=D, a22=S: y22=2, y23=2\n\nOr a21=D, a22=D: y22=2, y23=1\n\nOr a21=S, a22=D: y22=3, y23=2\n\nOr a21=D, a22=U: y22=2, y23=3>2 not <=2, etc.\n\nCases with y23 <=2.\n\nThen at t=23, y23<=2, say y23=2 or 1 or 0.\n\nThen I choose action to make y24=0 or 1.\n\nIf y23=2, I must do D to go to y24=1\n\nIf y23=1, I can do D to y24=0 or S to y24=1 or U to y24=2 but y24=2 bad, so only D or S.\n\nIf y23=0, I can do S to y24=0 or U to y24=1.\n\nNow, similarly for t=25.\n\nBut let's minimize the down.\n\nFor example, to have y23=2.\n\nThen I can go to y24=1.\n\nThen at t=24 y=1.\n\nNow for t=25, I need y25=0,1,9.\n\nIf I stay at t=24, a=S, y25=1, safe.\n\nThen from t=25 y=1, I can start going up.\n\nBut at t=25, if I do U, y26=2, etc.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, if I can be at higher y at t=25, but at t=25 I must be at low y.\n\nUnless I reach y=9 by t=25, but impossible from low.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I can be on y=9 before t=24, but impossible, as min time to y=9 is 6 turns, t=27.\n\nBut t=24 is earlier.\n\nt=21 to t=24 is only 3 turns, can't reach 9.\n\nSo no.\n\nSo best is to be at y=1 at t=24 and t=25, then go up.\n\nBut to have y25=1, I can be at y24=1 and stay.\n\nNow, let's choose a sequence with less down.\n\nFor example, from t=21, go down once to y=2 at t=22.\n\nt=21: a=D, y22=2\n\nThen t=22: y=2, now I can go down again to y=1 at t=23.\n\na22=D, y23=1\n\nThen t=23: y=1, now I need to set y24.\n\nSince y23=1, I can do S to have y24=1, or D to y24=0.\n\nIf I do S, y24=1.\n\nThen t=24: y=1, a=S, y25=1\n\nThen t=25: y=1, a=U, y26=2\n\netc.\n\nFrom t=21 to t=22: one action, to y=2\n\nt=22 to t=23: second action, to y=1\n\nt=23 to t=24: third action, S, to y=1\n\nThen from t=24 to t=25: S, to y=1\n\nThen start going up.\n\nBut I used two down actions to go from 3 to 1 in two steps.\n\ny from t=21:3, to t=22:2, t=23:1, t=24:1, t=25:1\n\nThen from t=25: y=1, U to t=26 y=2, U to t=27 y=3, U to t=28 y=4, U to t=29 y=5, U to t=30 y=6, U to t=31 y=7, U to t=32 y=8, U to t=33 y=9.\n\nSo y=9 at t=33, H such that t=21+H=33, H=12.\n\nBut earlier with three downs, I was at y=0 at t=24, same thing.\n\nCan I be at higher y at t=23?\n\nFor example, if I go up first.\n\nt=21: a=U, y22=4\n\nThen t=22: y=4, now I need y23 <=2, but from y=4, to y23<=2, I need to go down, e.g. a22=D, y23=3, or a22=D twice? Only one action.\n\na22: from y=4, D to y=3, S to y=4, U to y=5.\n\nSo y23 can be 3,4,5, all >2, so I cannot have y23<=2 if I went up first.\n\nIf I stay at t=21, a=S, y22=3, then a22=D, y23=2, which is <=2.\n\nOr a22=S, y23=3>2 not good.\n\nSo only if I go down at some point.\n\nTo have y23<=2, from y=3, I must have at least one down in first two actions.\n\nFor example:\n\n- a21=D, a22=S: y22=2, y23=2\n\n- a21=D, a22=D: y22=2, y23=1\n\n- a21=D, a22=U: y22=2, y23=3>2 not <=2\n\n- a21=S, a22=D: y22=3, y23=2\n\n- a21=S, a22=S: y22=3, y23=3>2\n\n- a21=U, a22=D: y22=4, y23=3>2\n\n- a21=U, a22=S: y22=4, y23=4>2\n\n- a21=U, a22=U: y22=4, y23=5>2\n\nSo only when I have at least one down, and not up when down would increase.\n\nSpecifically, cases with y23<=2: (D,S), (D,D), (S,D)\n\nWith y23=2,2,2 respectively? a21=D, a22=S: y22=2, y23=2\n\na21=D, a22=D: y22=2, y23=1\n\na21=S, a22=D: y22=3, y23=2\n\nSo y23=2 or 1.\n\nThen at t=23, y23=2 or 1.\n\nThen to have y24=0 or 1.\n\nIf y23=2, I must do D to go to y24=1 (since U to 3 bad, S to 2 bad)\n\nIf y23=1, I can do S to y24=1 or D to y24=0 (U to 2 bad)\n\nIf y23=0, but in this case y23=2 or 1, not 0.\n\nFrom above, y23=2 or 1.\n\nIf y23=2, I do D, y24=1\n\nIf y23=1, I can do S or D, to y24=1 or 0.\n\nTo minimize down, I can choose to have y24=1.\n\nFor example, if y23=2, do D to y24=1\n\nIf y23=1, do S to y24=1\n\nSo in both cases, I can be at y24=1.\n\nThen at t=24, y=1, I do S to have y25=1\n\nThen at t=25, y=1, I do U to y26=2, etc.\n\nSame as before.\n\nH is 12, but perhaps I can start going up earlier after t=25.\n\nBut from y=1, I need 8 steps to y=9.\n\nUnless I can be at higher y at t=26.\n\nBut at t=25 I am at y=1, so t=26 y=2 at best.\n\nThen to y=9, 7 more up, so y=9 at t=33.\n\nCan I avoid going down so much?\n\nAnother idea: at t=24 and t=25, I can be on y=0 instead, but same level.\n\nOr, since y=9 is safe, if I can reach y=9 by t=24 or 25, impossible.\n\nOr at t=25, if I can be at y=9, impossible.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=1 at t=24, but at t=25, instead of staying, I can go to y=0, but that doesn't help.\n\nOr, I can go up to y=9 after, but it's slow.\n\nBut let's check if there are other collisions.\n\nEarlier I assumed only t=22 for y=1 and t=24,25 for others.\n\nBut for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but we saw only the first one matters.\n\nIn freeway 7 and 8, there are cars at (18,7,right,6) and (54,43,right,6), but they never cover 0, so only the first car (-18,-29,right,6) causes collision at t=24,25.\n\nSimilarly for all.\n\nSo no other issues.\n\nPerhaps I can move in a way that at t=24 and t=25, I am on y=1, but then at t=25 I go up, but I can't because of collision.\n\nUnless I go to y=9 directly from y=1, but no.\n\nAnother thought: at t=25, if I am on y=9, but I can't be.\n\nOr, I can be on y=0 or 1.\n\nBut y=0 is lower, worse.\n\nSo best to be at y=1 at t=24 and t=25.\n\nThen from t=25 y=1, after U, t=26 y=2, which is safe.\n\nNow, to reduce H, I need to have a higher starting point after t=25.\n\nBut I can't, because I had to go down to 1.\n\nUnless I can be at y=1 at t=24, but at t=23 I was at y=2, for example, and I go down to y=1 at t=24.\n\nBut at t=23, if I am at y=2, I could have been higher earlier, but I had to have y23<=2.\n\nFor example, in the sequence where I do a21=S, a22=D, then y22=3, y23=2\n\nThen a23=D, y24=1\n\nThen a24=S, y25=1\n\na25=U, y26=2\n\netc.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf I do a21=D, a22=S, y22=2, y23=2\n\na23=D, y24=1\n\nsame.\n\nOr a21=D, a22=D, y22=2, y23=1, a23=S, y24=1\n\nsame.\n\nSo in all cases, I end up at y=1 at t=24 and t=25.\n\nThen from there, 8 up moves to y=9 at t=33.\n\nBut t=33 is turn t_1 + 12, since t_1=21, 21+12=33.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut is there a way to reach y=9 faster?\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=0 at t=24, but same level.\n\nOr, at t=25, if I am at y=1, I can go up to y=2 at t=26, but t=26 is late.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=23, I can be at y=2, and at t=23 it is safe, then at t=24 I go to y=1, safe.\n\nBut at t=25, I am at y=1, safe.\n\nThen from t=25, I go up.\n\nBut no way to skip.\n\nPerhaps I can go up before the critical period to some point, but I have to come down for t=24.\n\nFor example, at t=21, go up to y=4 at t=22.\n\nThen at t=22, y=4, I can go down to y=3 at t=23.\n\nBut at t=23, y=3, which is greater than 2, so to have y24=0 or 1, I need to go down two steps in one action, impossible.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=23, I can only go to y=2,3,4 at t=24, all unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to be at low y at t=24 and t=25.\n\nSo minimal H is 12, with y=9 at t=33.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nSequence:\n\nTo have y24=1 and y25=1.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn t=21: action D, so y22=2\n\nTurn t=22: action D, so y23=1\n\nTurn t=23: action S, so y24=1\n\nTurn t=24: action S, so y25=1\n\nTurn t=25: action U, so y26=2\n\nTurn t=26: action U, so y27=3\n\nTurn t=27: action U, so y28=4\n\nTurn t=28: action U, so y29=5\n\nTurn t=29: action U, so y30=6\n\nTurn t=30: action U, so y31=7\n\nTurn t=31: action U, so y32=8\n\nTurn t=32: action U, so y33=9\n\nAt t=33, y=9.\n\nActions from t=21 to t=32, that's 12 actions.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence?\n\nSuppose at t=23, I am at y=1, and I do D to go to y=0 at t=24.\n\nThen at t=24 y=0, I can do U to y=1 at t=25.\n\nThen t=25 y=1, same as before.\n\nThen from there, same up sequence.\n\nBut at t=24 y=0, if I do U, y25=1, safe.\n\nThen t=25 y=1, U to y26=2, etc.\n\nStill reach y=9 at t=33.\n\nSame.\n\nIf at t=24 y=0, I do U to y=1 at t=25, then U to y=2 at t=26, same.\n\nNo gain.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=1 at t=24, but at t=25, instead of staying, I go down to y=0, but that would make it worse, as I have to go up from 0 later.\n\nSo not better.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach y=9 earlier by being at higher y at t=26.\n\nBut at t=25 I am at y=1, so at t=26 y=2 at best.\n\ny=2 to y=9, 7 up moves, from t=26 to t=32 y=8, t=33 y=9.\n\nSame.\n\nUnless I can be at y=3 or higher at t=26, but from y=1 at t=25, I can only be at y=2 at t=26.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of turns H is 12.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have actions from t=21 to t=32.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to list the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence above, I used two down and one stay to get to y=1 at t=24.\n\nI could have other sequences, but same H.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=4 first, but then I have to go down more, which takes more turns.\n\nFor example, t=21 U, y22=4\n\nThen I need to get to y<=2 at t=23, so from y=4 at t=22, I do D, y23=3\n\nBut y23=3>2, not <=2, so at t=23, I am at y=3, then to go to y=0 or 1 at t=24, impossible, I can only go to y=2,3,4, all bad.\n\nSo I cannot.\n\nTherefore, the sequence I have is fine.\n\nNow, for the actions:\n\nTurn t_1 =21: action D\n\nTurn t_1+1=22: action D\n\nTurn t_1+2=23: action S\n\nTurn t_1+3=24: action S\n\nTurn t_1+4=25: action U\n\nTurn t_1+5=26: action U\n\nTurn t_1+6=27: action U\n\nTurn t_1+7=28: action U\n\nTurn t_1+8=29: action U\n\nTurn t_1+9=30: action U\n\nTurn t_1+10=31: action U\n\nTurn t_1+11=32: action U\n\nThen at turn t_1+12=33, y=9.\n\nH=12 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=21 to t=32, that's 12 turns of actions.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nHere t_1=21, H=12, so actions from t=21 to t=21+11=32.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to 11, but turn number t_1 + t.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nWith H such that at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nIn this case, a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 +11}, with t_1 +12 =33, y=9.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I used D, D, S, S, then U repeated.\n\nBut at t=23, I did S to stay at y=1 for t=24.\n\nI could have done D to go to y=0, but same.\n\nNow, but let's verify if there is collision.\n\nAt t=21: y=3, freeway 3, at Δt=0, span [-29,-18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction D, go to y=2\n\nt=22: y=2, freeway 2, at Δt=1, T=22, freeway 2 collision at t=24,25, not t=22, span at t=22: Δt=1, for car on y=2: [-29+6= -23? s=6, Δt=1, span [-29+6*1, -18+6*1] = [-23, -12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction D, go to y=1\n\nt=23: y=1, freeway 1, at Δt=2, T=23, freeway 1 collision only at t=22, at t=23 span [-23+12*2, -12+12*2]? t=23, Δt=2, s=12 for y=1 car.\n\nSpan: [-23 + 12*2, -12 + 12*2] = [-23+24=1, -12+24=12], 1 to 12, 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction S, so y24=1\n\nt=24: y=1, freeway 1, Δt=3, T=24, span [-23+36? Δt=3, s=12, [-23 + 12*3, -12 + 12*3] = [-23+36=13, -12+36=24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction S, y25=1\n\nt=25: y=1, freeway 1, same, span at Δt=4, [-23+48=25, -12+48=36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U, y26=2\n\nt=26: y=2, freeway 2, Δt=5, T=26, car on y=2: s=6, span [-29 + 6*5, -18 + 6*5] = [-29+30=1, -18+30=12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAnd similarly, no cars cover 0 at later times, so all safe up to y=9.\n\nNow, can I do with less than 12 turns?\n\nSuppose I go to y=1 at t=24, but then at t=24, instead of staying, I go up, but then at t=25 y=2 collide, not possible.\n\nOr, if I can be at y=9 at t=27, but from y=1 at t=25, I need to be at y=9 at t=27, impossible, too far.\n\nt=25 y=1, t=26 y=2, t=27 y=3, not 9.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let's see the car states again.\n\nIn freeway 7 and 8, there are other cars, but we saw they don't affect.\n\nFor example, at t=26, y=2, car on y=2: only one car, span [1,12] not cover 0.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at t=27 if I don't go down.\n\nBut earlier, if I go straight, at t=24 y=6 collide.\n\nUnless I wait at some point.\n\nFor example, at t=21, y=3, I stay: a=S, y22=3\n\nThen a=S, y23=3\n\nThen at t=23, y=3, I need to avoid t=24, so I must go down or something, but from y=3, to y=0 or 1 at t=24, impossible with one action.\n\na23=D, y24=2, but y=2 at t=24 collide.\n\na23=S, y24=3, collide.\n\na23=U, y24=4, collide.\n\nSo I must have gone down earlier to be low at t=24.\n\nNo other way.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 12.\n\nSo the sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 21: D\n\nTurn 22: D\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: S\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nThen at turn 33, y=9.\n\nIn the actions, from turn 21 to 32.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed.\n\nSince t_1=21, H=12, actions from t=21 to t=32.\n\nBut in the box.\n\nPerhaps I can write the actions only.\n\nBut let's see if I can reduce by one.\n\nSuppose at t=23, I am at y=2, and I do D to y=1 at t=24.\n\nThen at t=24, y=1, I do U, but then t=25 y=2 collide.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf at t=24 I do S, y25=1, then U at t=25 to y=2 at t=26.\n\nBut at t=25, I am at y=1, I could do U, but to y=2 at t=26, same as before.\n\nNo, at t=25, if I do U, I go to y=2 at t=26, but at turn t=25, I am at y=1, action U sets y26=2.\n\nBut at t=25, I am on y=1, which is fine, and I choose action.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, I need to start going up earlier, but I can't because of t=25 constraint.\n\nAnother idea: if I am at y=1 at t=24, and I do nothing, then at t=25 y=1, then I go up.\n\nBut after t=25, I can go up multiple, but still 8 steps.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=0 at t=24, then at t=24 I do U to y=1 at t=25, then at t=25 y=1, I do U to y=2 at t=26, same.\n\nOr at t=24 y=0, I do U to y=1 at t=25, then at t=25 y=1, I do U to y=2 at t=26.\n\nBut at t=25, I am at y=1, fine.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 21\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 12. This sequence ensures that the player is not on any freeway \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 8\\) during turns \\(T = 24\\) and \\(T = 25\\), when collisions occur on those freeways, by moving to and staying at \\(y = 1\\) (which is safe at these times) until after the critical period.

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,2) at turn t1=26 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: U for up (+1), D for down (-1), or S for stay (0), and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I have its head, tail, direction, and speed at turn t1. I need to compute where they are at future turns to avoid collisions.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for a car on that freeway, 0 is within the car's span at that exact turn T. Importantly, when the player moves to a new row, they are not on that row until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is the top, and since it's y=0 to 9, y=9 is the target. There are no cars on y=9 because freeways are from y=1 to 8, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe and don't need to worry about cars.\n\nNow, current position is y=2 at t=26.\n\nI need to go from y=2 to y=9, so I need to move up 7 units. But since I can move at most +1 per turn, minimum H would be 7 if I could go straight up without any obstacles. But there are cars, so I might need to wait or move down sometimes to avoid collisions.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the starting turn? Let's see the sequence: actions from t=0 to H-1 for H turns, starting from t1.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, that's H actions, and after H turns, we should be at (0,9).\n\nAt turn t1, we are at position (0, y_t1), and after action a_{t1}, we move to new position at t1+1, and so on, up to after action a_{t1+H-1}, we are at position at time t1+H.\n\nLet me denote the turn when we take action.\n\nAt time t, we take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at time t, we are at y_t, and we choose a_t to set y_{t+1}.\n\nThen, collision is checked at each turn T: if at turn T, we are on y_T, and for a car on freeway y_T, 0 is in the car's span at that turn T.\n\nIn this case, since we're always at x=0, and cars are moving horizontally, collision is when the car covers x=0 at the same turn we're on that row.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to know when cars are at x=0.\n\nLet me list all cars and when they occupy x=0.\n\nFirst, for each car, given head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s at time t1=26.\n\nThe span at time T is given by the formulas.\n\nFor left-moving cars: span at T is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, head and tail decrease.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] with h > τ? No.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nThis implies that at t1, span is from h to τ, and since it's left-moving, h and τ are positions, and h > τ probably, but it says [h, τ], which might be from min to max or as given.\n\nIn the example, for freeway 1: (48,37,right,12), so head 48, tail 37, both positive, and direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h]? Let's see the notation.\n\n\"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor freeway 1: (48,37,right,12), so head=48, tail=37, direction=right.\n\nThen for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [37,48], I think? But in the text it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\", so τ is tail, h is head, so for right-moving, [tail, head] since tail < head if moving right.\n\nIn this case, tail=37, head=48, so [37,48] at t1.\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [37 + 12(T-26), 48 + 12(T-26)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, but in this problem, all cars seem to be right-moving, I think? Let me check the directions.\n\nFreeway 1: right\n\nFreeway 2: right\n\nFreeway 3: right\n\nFreeway 4: right\n\nFreeway 5: right\n\nFreeway 6: right\n\nFreeway 7: three cars, all right: (12,1,right,6), (48,37,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7: (12,1,right,6), (48,37,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nAll cars are right-moving. No left-moving cars.\n\nSo for all, direction is right, so span at time T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd collision when 0 is in [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] for some car on the freeway at time T.\n\nThat is, τ + s(T-t1) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T-t1)\n\nSince the car is moving right, the span is increasing.\n\nNow, let me denote Δt = T - t1, so at time T = t1 + Δt, span is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\n0 is occupied when τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nWhich is equivalent to -h/s ≤ Δt ≤ -τ/s? Let's solve inequalities.\n\nτ + s Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nFirst inequality: τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ s Δt ≤ -τ ⇒ Δt ≤ -τ/s (since s>0)\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ h + s Δt ⇒ s Δt ≥ -h ⇒ Δt ≥ -h/s\n\nBut since the car is moving right, h and τ, for example, freeway 1: h=48, τ=37, both positive, so -h/s = -48/12 = -4, -τ/s = -37/12 ≈ -3.083\n\nSo Δt ≥ -4 and Δt ≤ -3.083? That can't be right because Δt is time from t1, so for future, Δt >=0.\n\nI think I have a sign error.\n\nLet me rewrite:\n\nτ + s Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ s Δt ≤ -τ ⇒ Δt ≤ -τ/s\n\nBut -τ/s is negative since τ>0, so for Δt >=0, this is never true? No.\n\nτ + s Δt ≤ 0: since τ and s positive, for small Δt, τ + s Δt >0, so it only becomes <=0 when Δt is large negative, but Δt = T - t1, T >= t1, so Δt >=0.\n\nSimilarly, h + s Δt >=0 always for Δt >=0 since h>0.\n\nLet's think.\n\nFor a right-moving car, with head and tail at t1, both positive, the span is moving right, so it will cover x=0 only if at some point the left end is <=0 and right end >=0.\n\nAt t1, for freeway 1, span [37,48], both positive, so x=0 is not covered.\n\nAs Δt increases, the span moves right, so left end τ + s Δt increases, right end h + s Δt increases, so since at Δt=0, left end 37>0, it will never cover x=0 because it's moving away from zero.\n\nSimilarly for other cars with positive positions.\n\nBut look at freeway 7 and 8, there are cars with negative positions.\n\nFor example, (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nHead = -30, tail = -41, direction right, speed 6.\n\nAt t1, span: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-41, -30]? Tail τ = -41, head h = -30.\n\nIn the notation, (head, tail, direction), and for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is left end, h is right end.\n\nIn this case, τ = -41, h = -30, so span at t1 is [-41, -30].\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-41 + 6 Δt, -30 + 6 Δt]\n\n0 is in this interval when -41 + 6 Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -30 + 6 Δt\n\nFirst: -41 + 6 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 6 Δt ≤ 41 ⇒ Δt ≤ 41/6 ≈ 6.833\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -30 + 6 Δt ⇒ 6 Δt ≥ 30 ⇒ Δt ≥ 5\n\nSo for Δt in [5, 6.833], approximately, 0 is covered.\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nAlso, for cars with positive positions, like (12,1,right,6), head=12, tail=1, span at t1 [1,12], at T [1 + 6 Δt, 12 + 6 Δt], which for Δt>=0, min is 1>0, so never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly for (48,37,right,6) or (48,37,right,12), all positive, so never cover 0.\n\nOnly cars with negative parts can cover 0, or if head negative and tail more negative, but in this case, only the cars with negative positions.\n\nNow, let's list all cars that can potentially cover x=0.\n\nFirst, on which freeways are there such cars?\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: (48,37,right,12) - both positive, never at 0.\n\nFreeway 2: (12,1,right,6) - both positive, never at 0.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3,4,5,6: all have (12,1,right,6) or similar, all positive, so no car covers 0 on these freeways.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (12,1,right,6) - positive, no; (48,37,right,6) - positive, no; (-30,-41,right,6) - this one can cover 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as 7, with (-30,-41,right,6) that can cover 0.\n\nAlso, freeway 7 has three cars, but only the last one matters for covering 0.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nNow, freeway 6 has only (12,1,right,6), no negative car.\n\nFreeway 1 to 6 all have cars with positive positions only, so x=0 is never occupied on these freeways.\n\nOnly freeway 7 and 8 have a car that can cover x=0.\n\nSpecifically, for freeway 7, car: head=-30, tail=-41, speed=6\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same: head=-30, tail=-41, speed=6\n\nNow, for freeway 7, collision when 0 in [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-41 + 6 Δt, -30 + 6 Δt]\n\nAs above:\n\n-41 + 6 Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -30 + 6 Δt\n\nWhich is:\n\n6 Δt ≤ 41 ⇒ Δt ≤ 41/6 ≈ 6.8333\n\n6 Δt ≥ 30 ⇒ Δt ≥ 5\n\nSince Δt must be integer (turns are discrete), Δt >=5 and Δt <=6 because Δt <=6.833, so Δt=5 or 6.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same thing, since same car parameters.\n\nNow, at Δt=5, T = t1 +5 = 26+5=31\n\nAt Δt=6, T=26+6=32\n\nFor freeway 7, occupied at T=31 and T=32.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nBut we need to be on that freeway at that turn to collide.\n\nNow, for other freeways, no cars cover x=0, so we can be on them at any time without collision.\n\nExcept that freeways 1 to 6 have cars, but since they never cover x=0, it's safe to be on them, no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 and y=9 have no freeways, so no cars, always safe.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, no cars, and y=9 is target, no cars.\n\nNow, player starts at y=2 at t=26.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe dangerous rows are y=7 and y=8, because only there cars can be at x=0 at certain times.\n\nSpecifically, on y=7, collision possible at T=31 and T=32.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at same times.\n\nNow, for other rows, no danger.\n\ny=1 to y=6: no cars that cover x=0, so safe at all times.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=2, we need to move up to y=9.\n\nMinimum turns: from y=2 to y=9, difference 7, so if we move up every turn, we can reach in 7 turns: at t=27: y=3, t=28: y=4, ..., t=32: y=8, t=33: y=9? Let's see the timing.\n\nAt time t, we are at y_t, take action a_t, go to y_{t+1}.\n\nStart: at t=26, y=2.\n\nAfter action a_{26}, at t=27, y= y_26 + Δy_26\n\nSimilarly, after a_{27}, at t=28, y= y_27 + Δy_27, and so on.\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nThen H is such that at turn t1 + H, y=9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, so actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at time t1 + H.\n\nAnd we want position at time t1 + H to be (0,9).\n\nIn terms of y, at time t1 + H, y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nFrom start: at time t1, y=2.\n\nAfter first action (t=t1), at time t1+1, y could be 1,2,3.\n\nSimilarly, after k actions, at time t1+k, y position.\n\nWe want min H such that at time t1 + H, y=9.\n\nSince we start at t1 with y=2, and need to reach y=9, the minimal number of steps is 7 if we always go up, but we might need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at dangerous times.\n\nDangerous times for y=7 and y=8 are T=31 and T=32.\n\nT=31 is t1 +5, since t1=26, 26+5=31.\n\nT=32 is t1+6.\n\nNow, if we go directly up:\n\nAction at t=26: U, then at t=27, y=3\n\na_{27}: U, t=28, y=4\n\na_{28}: U, t=29, y=5\n\na_{29}: U, t=30, y=6\n\na_{30}: U, t=31, y=7\n\na_{31}: U, t=32, y=8\n\na_{32}: U, t=33, y=9\n\nNow, at t=31, y=7, and t=31 is dangerous for y=7, collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, at t=32, y=8, dangerous.\n\nSo we collide at both turns.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=7 at t=31 or t=32? t=31 and t=32 are the times when collision happens on y=7 and y=8.\n\nFor y=7, collision at T=31 and T=32.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=31, we are on y=7, which is dangerous, and at t=32, on y=8, dangerous.\n\nSo we need to modify the path.\n\nPossible ways: delay reaching y=7 or y=8 until after t=32, or be there before t=31 or after t=32.\n\nBut t=31 and 32 are the only dangerous times.\n\nFor y=7, safe except at t=31 and t=32.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nt=31 and t=32 are the times when the car covers x=0.\n\nFor earlier or later times, no cover, so safe.\n\nSince the car moves continuously, but we have discrete times.\n\nFor freeway 7, at Δt=5, T=31: span [-41 + 6*5, -30 + 6*5] = [-41+30, -30+30] = [-11,0]\n\nAt T=31, span is [-11,0], so 0 is included, collision if on y=7.\n\nAt Δt=6, T=32: span [-41 + 36, -30 + 36] = [-5,6], which includes 0.\n\nAt Δt=4, T=30: span [-41+24, -30+24] = [-17,-6], all negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt Δt=7, T=33: span [-41+42, -30+42] = [1,12], all positive, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, same car, same times dangerous.\n\nNow, for other freeways, no danger.\n\nSo, to reach y=9, we need to be on y=7 or y=8 only when safe.\n\nSpecifically, for y=7, safe at all times except t=31 and t=32.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, safe except t=31 and t=32.\n\nNow, y=1 to y=6 are always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nWe start at t=26, y=2.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nThe dangerous period is around t=31-32.\n\nIf we can pass through y=7 and y=8 before t=31 or after t=32.\n\nBefore t=31: t=30 or earlier.\n\nAfter t=32: t=33 or later.\n\nt=31 and t=32 are bad.\n\nNow, from start at t=26, y=2.\n\nIf we go up as fast as possible, we reach y=7 at t=31 (as above), which is bad.\n\nWe need to either slow down or go down to avoid being at y=7 or y=8 at t=31 or 32.\n\nOption 1: reach y=7 before t=31.\n\nFor example, at t=30 or earlier.\n\nBut from y=2 at t=26, to reach y=7 at t=30, that means in 4 steps from t=26 to t=30.\n\nFrom t=26 to t=30: actions at t=26,27,28,29 determine position at t=30.\n\nAt t=30, y=?\n\nTo have y=7 at t=30, we need to increase y by 5 in 4 actions? From t=26 to t=30: after 4 actions, position at t=30.\n\nStart at t=26, y=2.\n\nAfter a_{26}, t=27, y=2 + Δy26\n\nAfter a_{27}, t=28, y= y27 + Δy27\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{29}, t=30, y= position.\n\nWe want at t=30, y=7.\n\nSo from y=2 to y=7 in 4 steps? Difference 5, so we need to move up 5 times, but only 4 actions? Actions from t=26 to t=29, that's 4 actions, can increase y by at most 4, to y=6 at t=30, not 7.\n\nLet's clarify:\n\n- At time t=26, position y=2\n\n- Take action a_{26}, move to y_{27} = y_{26} + Δy_{26}\n\n- At time t=27, position y=27\n\n- Take action a_{27}, move to y_{28} = y_{27} + Δy_{27}\n\n- ...\n\n- Take action at t, move to y_{t+1}\n\nTo have position at time T, it is after the action at T-1.\n\nPosition at time t is determined by actions up to t-1.\n\nAt time t, we are at y_t, which was set by action at t-1? No.\n\nAt time t, we take action a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nBut at time t, before action, we are at y_t.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, we are at position y_T, and we check for cars on freeway y_T.\n\nAt time T, we are at y_T, which was determined by previous actions.\n\nFrom start: at t=26, y=2.\n\nAfter action a_{26}, at t=27, y= y_26 + Δy_26\n\nAfter action a_{27}, at t=28, y= y_27 + Δy_27\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{k}, at t=k+1, y= y_k + Δy_k\n\nPosition at time m is y_m.\n\nTo have y_m =9 for some m.\n\nMin m such that y_m=9.\n\nFrom y_26=2, to y_m=9, minimal m-26=7 if always up.\n\ny_m = y_26 + sum of Δy from t=26 to t=m-1.\n\ny_m = y_26 + sum_{k=26}^{m-1} Δy_k\n\nΔy_k depends on action.\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1.\n\nTo increase by 7, need at least 7 up actions.\n\nThe time to reach: let say we reach at time M, so y_M=9.\n\nThen M - 26 = number of turns, but y_M = y_26 + sum_{k=26}^{M-1} Δy_k\n\nSince y_26=2, y_M=9, so sum from k=26 to M-1 of Δy_k = 7\n\nEach |Δy| <=1, so min number of actions is 7, achieved only if all Δy= +1, i.e., all U actions.\n\nThen, with 7 U actions, y increases by 7 from t=26 to t=26+7=33.\n\nSpecifically: at t=26, y=2\n\na26=U, t=27, y=3\n\na27=U, t=28, y=4\n\na28=U, t=29, y=5\n\na29=U, t=30, y=6\n\na30=U, t=31, y=7\n\na31=U, t=32, y=8\n\na32=U, t=33, y=9\n\nSo at t=33, y=9.\n\nBut at t=31, y=7, dangerous; t=32, y=8, dangerous.\n\nTo avoid, we need to not be on y=7 at t=31 or t=32, and not on y=8 at t=31 or t=32.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=7 at t=31 and on y=8 at t=32.\n\nWe need to be on y=7 only when t !=31,32, similarly for y=8.\n\nBut t=31 and 32 are consecutive, so we can be on y=7 before t=31 or after t=32.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, since we need to go through y=7 and y=8, we have to be there at some point.\n\nPossible to be on y=7 at t<=30 or t>=33.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at t<=30 or t>=33.\n\nBut t=30 is safe for y=7, since at t=30, no collision on y=7.\n\nt=33 is also safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nBut we also need to reach y=9.\n\nIf we want to be on y=7 at t=30, for example.\n\nAt t=30, y=7.\n\nNow, from t=26, y=2, to t=30, y=7, that means in 4 steps (actions at t=26 to t=29), we increase y by 5? Position at t=30 is set by actions from t=26 to t=29? Let's see.\n\ny_{30} = y_{26} + sum_{k=26}^{29} Δy_k\n\ny_{26} =2, y_{30} =7, so sum_{k=26}^{29} Δy_k =5\n\nBut there are 4 actions: k=26,27,28,29.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so max increase 4, to y=6 at t=30, cannot reach y=7 at t=30 with 4 actions.\n\nMin time to reach y=7: from y=2, need 5 up moves.\n\nEarliest at t=26+5=31, y=7.\n\nSimilarly, latest, but we want min H, so probably not late.\n\nAt t=31, y=7 is possible, but dangerous.\n\nWe can be at y=7 at t=31 only if we avoid, but we cannot because it's dangerous.\n\nt=31 is the first possible time to be at y=7, but it's dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, we can be at y=7 later, at t=32 or later.\n\nFor example, at t=32, y=7.\n\nBut at t=32, on y=7 is dangerous.\n\nt=32 is dangerous for y=7.\n\nSafe times for y=7 are t<=30 or t>=33.\n\nt=30: y=7 possible? At t=30, y=7.\n\nFrom start, to have y=7 at t=30.\n\ny_{30} = y_{26} + sum_{k=26}^{29} Δy_k =2 + sum of 4 actions.\n\nMax sum is 4, so y_{30} <= 2+4=6, cannot be 7 at t=30.\n\nSimilarly, y_{31} = y_{26} + sum_{k=26}^{30} Δy_k\n\nTo have y_{31}=7, sum_{k=26}^{30} Δy_k =5, with 5 actions? Actions k=26 to k=30, that's 5 actions.\n\nk from 26 to 30 inclusive: 5 terms.\n\ny_{31} = y_{26} + sum_{k=26}^{30} Δy_k\n\nSet y_{31}=7, y_{26}=2, so sum_{k=26}^{30} Δy_k =5\n\nSince 5 actions, each Δy <=1, so must all be U, so y_{31}=7 at t=31.\n\nBut t=31 is dangerous for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, if we want y_{31}=6, for example, then we can have some S or D, but we need to reach y=9 eventually.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=33.\n\ny_{33} = y_{26} + sum_{k=26}^{32} Δy_k\n\nSet y_{33}=7, so sum_{k=26}^{32} Δy_k =5 with 7 actions? k=26 to 32 inclusive: 7 actions.\n\nBut we can have some S or D actions to delay.\n\nBut we want min H, so delaying might not be efficient.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8.\n\nFirst, let's list the safe times for each row.\n\nFor rows y=1 to y=6: always safe.\n\ny=7: safe except t=31 and t=32\n\ny=8: safe except t=31 and t=32\n\ny=9: always safe\n\ny=0: always safe\n\nWe start at t=26, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some time M.\n\nMin M such that y_M=9.\n\nWith all U, M=33, y=9.\n\nBut at t=31 and 32, we are on dangerous rows if we go straight.\n\nTo avoid, we can:\n\n- Be on y=7 at t=33 or later, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, to be at y=7 at t=33: y_{33}=7.\n\nThen from y_{26}=2 to y_{33}=7 in 7 steps (actions t=26 to t=32), but y_{33} - y_{26} = sum_{k=26}^{32} Δy_k =5\n\nWith 7 actions, we can have 5 U and 2 S or D, but since we want to min time to reach y=9, we should not go down.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=9 later.\n\nBut min H is when we reach at min time, which is 33 with all U, but with collision.\n\nWe need to add extra actions to avoid the collision times.\n\nAnother idea: at the dangerous times, be on a safe row.\n\nFor example, at t=31 and t=32, be on y=6 or y=9 or something safe.\n\nBut we need to go through y=7 and y=8.\n\nPerhaps we can stay at y=6 for a while.\n\nLet's plan the path.\n\nStart at t=26, y=2.\n\nWe can go up to y=6 quickly, then stay at y=6 during t=31 and t=32, since y=6 is safe, then after t=32, go up to y=7,8,9.\n\nSimilarly, we can go to y=6 and wait.\n\nFirst, go from y=2 to y=6.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=6, need increase by 4.\n\nCan be done in 4 turns: actions U,U,U,U.\n\nAt t=26, y=2\n\na26=U, t=27, y=3\n\na27=U, t=28, y=4\n\na28=U, t=29, y=5\n\na29=U, t=30, y=6\n\nNow at t=30, y=6.\n\nt=31 and t=32 are dangerous for y=7 and y=8, but y=6 is safe.\n\nSo we can stay at y=6 for t=31 and t=32.\n\nHow? By using S action.\n\nAt t=30, we are at y=6 (position at time t=30).\n\nTake action a30=S, then at t=31, y=6 +0 =6\n\nThen at t=31, take action a31=S, at t=32, y=6\n\nThen at t=32, take action a32=U, at t=33, y=7\n\nBut at t=33, y=7, which is safe because t=33>32, not dangerous.\n\nThen continue: a33=U, t=34, y=8\n\na34=U, t=35, y=9\n\nBut at t=34, y=8, which is also safe since t=34>32.\n\nThen at t=35, y=9, reached.\n\nBut we used extra S actions, so we reached at t=35, whereas min was 33, so H=35-26=9? Let's see the time.\n\nStarted at t=26, reached y=9 at t=35, so after 9 actions? Let's count the turns.\n\nTime when we reach y=9 is t=35.\n\nAt t=26, y=2.\n\nAfter actions: let's list\n\nt | y_t | action a_t | next y\n26 | 2 |  ?  | \n\nWe need to specify actions.\n\nSet:\n\nAt t=26, y=2, take a26=U, so at t=27, y=3\n\nt=27, y=3, take a27=U, at t=28, y=4\n\nt=28, y=4, take a28=U, at t=29, y=5\n\nt=29, y=5, take a29=U, at t=30, y=6\n\nt=30, y=6, take a30=S, at t=31, y=6\n\nt=31, y=6, take a31=S, at t=32, y=6\n\nt=32, y=6, take a32=U, at t=33, y=7\n\nt=33, y=7, take a33=U, at t=34, y=8\n\nt=34, y=8, take a34=U, at t=35, y=9\n\nYes, at t=35, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns from start to end.\n\nStarted at t=26, ended at t=35, so 10 turns? t from 26 to 35 inclusive is 10 positions, but actions from t=26 to t=34, 9 actions.\n\nThe sequence: actions from t=26 to t=26+H-1 for H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t=26 + H.\n\nWe want at time t=26 + H, y=9.\n\nIn this case, at time t=35, y=9, so 26 + H = 35, so H=9.\n\nActions at t=26 to t=34, 9 actions.\n\nBut min possible is 7, with H=7, at t=33.\n\nBut we have collision.\n\nCan we do better than H=9?\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier by not waiting full two turns.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=7 after t=32.\n\nFor example, at t=33, y=7.\n\nTo have y=7 at t=33.\n\ny_{33} = y_{26} + sum_{k=26}^{32} Δy_k =2 + sum of 7 actions (k=26 to 32) =7, so sum=5.\n\nThus, with 7 actions, increase by 5, so we can have 5 U and 2 other actions, like S or D.\n\nBut to min time, we should not go down, so S actions.\n\nFor example, we can have S at some points.\n\nBut we start from y=2, to reach y=7 at t=33, with sum of Δy from 26 to 32 =5.\n\nSince min actions to increase by 5 is 5, but we have 7 actions, so we need to waste 2 actions, like staying or going down, but going down would require more up later.\n\nSo better to stay.\n\nFor example, stay at some safe row during dangerous times.\n\nBut we can be on y=6 at t=31 and t=32, which is safe.\n\nThen go up.\n\nIn the previous path, we reached at t=35 with H=9.\n\nBut we can reach y=9 at t=34 or earlier?\n\nWith all U, we can be at y=8 at t=32, but t=32 is dangerous for y=8.\n\nIf we can be at y=8 at t=33.\n\ny_{33}=8.\n\ny_{33} = y_{26} + sum_{k=26}^{32} Δy_k =2 + sum of 7 actions =8, so sum=6.\n\nThus need 6 U and one S or something.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 at t=34.\n\ny_{34} = y_{26} + sum_{k=26}^{33} Δy_k\n\nSet to 9, so sum=7 with 8 actions, so one S possible.\n\nBut let's see if we can avoid the collision with fewer delays.\n\nAnother idea: at t=31, instead of being on y=7, be on another row.\n\nFor example, go down to y=5 or something at t=31.\n\nBut that might take more steps.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are only dangerous at t=31 and t=32, and we need to be on them at some point, we can be on y=7 at t=33, for example.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=33.\n\nAs above, y_{33} =7, so from t=26 to t=33, 7 time steps, but actions from t=26 to t=32.\n\nPosition at t=33 is after actions up to t=32.\n\ny_{33} = y_{26} + sum_{k=26}^{32} Δy_k\n\nSet to 7, so 2 + sum =7, sum=5 with 7 actions (k=26 to 32 inclusive is 7 actions).\n\nSo we need to have only 5 up moves in 7 actions, meaning we must have 2 stays or downs.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=9 later.\n\nBut let's minimize the arrival time.\n\nThe critical point is that at t=31 and t=32, we must not be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nSo we can be on y=6, which is safe, or y=9, but y=9 is target, or lower.\n\nSince y=6 is safe, we can be on y=6 at t=30, t=31, t=32.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=7 at t=33, etc.\n\nNow, to reach y=6: from y=2 at t=26, to y=6 at t=30, as before, with 4 U actions.\n\nThen at t=30, y=6.\n\nNow, we need to cover t=31 and t=32 on safe row.\n\nSo at t=30, take S, to stay at y=6 for t=31.\n\nThen at t=31, take S, to stay at y=6 for t=32.\n\nThen at t=32, take U, to go to y=7 at t=33.\n\nThen at t=33, y=7, safe, take U, to y=8 at t=34.\n\nThen at t=34, y=8, safe (t=34>32), take U, to y=9 at t=35.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut at t=34, y=8 is safe, yes.\n\nCan we reach y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=8 at t=33.\n\ny_{33}=8.\n\ny_{33} = y_{26} + sum_{k=26}^{32} Δy_k =2 + sum =8, so sum=6 with 7 actions.\n\nSo we need 6 U and one other action.\n\nBut we have to be careful with the timing.\n\nFor instance, we can go up faster initially or something.\n\nStart at t=26, y=2.\n\nTake U, t=27, y=3\n\nU, t=28, y=4\n\nU, t=29, y=5\n\nNow at t=29, y=5.\n\nWe need to have y_{33}=8.\n\nFrom t=29, y=5, to t=33, y=8, need increase by 3 in 4 actions (actions at t=29,30,31,32).\n\nActions at t=29,30,31,32 determine y_{33}.\n\ny_{33} = y_{29} + sum_{k=29}^{32} Δy_k\n\ny_{29}=5, set y_{33}=8, so sum_{k=29}^{32} Δy_k =3\n\nWith 4 actions, so we can have three U and one S.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that at t=31 and t=32, we are not on y=7 or y=8.\n\nt=31 position y_{31}, which depends on actions up to t=30.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nList positions:\n\nAt t=29, y=5\n\nTake action a29, determines y_{30}\n\nThen a30, determines y_{31}\n\na31, determines y_{32}\n\na32, determines y_{33}\n\nWe want y_{33}=8\n\nAnd at t=31, y_{31} should not be 7 or 8? y_{31} could be 6 or something.\n\nSimilarly at t=32, y_{32} not 7 or 8.\n\nNow, y_{31} = y_{29} + Δy_{29} + Δy_{30}  (since y_{31} = y_{30} + Δy_{30}, but y_{30} = y_{29} + Δy_{29}, so y_{31} = y_{29} + Δy_{29} + Δy_{30})\n\nSimilarly, y_{32} = y_{29} + Δy_{29} + Δy_{30} + Δy_{31}\n\ny_{33} = y_{29} + Δy_{29} + Δy_{30} + Δy_{31} + Δy_{32}\n\nSet y_{33} =8, y_{29}=5, so Δy_{29} + Δy_{30} + Δy_{31} + Δy_{32} =3\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}\n\nNow, at t=31, position y_{31} = y_{29} + Δy_{29} + Δy_{30} =5 + Δy_{29} + Δy_{30}\n\nWe need y_{31} ≠ 7 and y_{31} ≠ 8? But y=8 might be possible later, but at t=31, if y_{31}=8, it is dangerous because t=31 is dangerous for y=8.\n\nSimilarly, if y_{31}=7, dangerous.\n\nSo we need y_{31} not 7 and not 8.\n\nSimilarly, at t=32, y_{32} = y_{29} + Δy_{29} + Δy_{30} + Δy_{31} =5 + sum of three Δy\n\nWe need y_{32} ≠ 7 and y_{32} ≠ 8?

The sequence ensures that the player is not on freeways \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at turns \\(T = 31\\) and \\(T = 32\\), as these are the only times when cars on those freeways occupy \\(x = 0\\), causing a collision if the player is present.\n\n- At turns 31 and 32, cars on freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) occupy \\(x = 0\\) due to the car with parameters \\((-30, -41, \\text{right}, 6)\\). Specifically:\n  - For \\(\\Delta t = T - t_1\\), at \\(\\Delta t = 5\\) (\\(T = 31\\)), the span is \\([-41 + 6 \\times 5, -30 + 6 \\times 5] = [-11, 0]\\), which includes 0.\n  - At \\(\\Delta t = 6\\) (\\(T = 32\\)), the span is \\([-41 + 6 \\times 6, -30 + 6 \\times 6] = [-5, 6]\\), which includes 0.\n- All other freeways (\\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\)) are safe at all times, as no cars occupy \\(x = 0\\). Freeways \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) have no cars and are always safe.\n\nThe minimal path involves moving up to \\(y = 6\\) by turn 30, staying on \\(y = 6\\) (a safe row) during turns 31 and 32, and then moving up to \\(y = 9\\) by turn 35. This requires 9 actions (from turn 26 to turn 34), with the player reaching (0, 9) at turn 35.\n\n**Action Sequence (minimal \\(H = 9\\)):**\n- Turn 26: U (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 27)\n- Turn 27: U (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 28)\n- Turn 28: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 29)\n- Turn 29: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 30)\n- Turn 30: S (stay at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 31; safe, as \\(y = 6\\) has no collision risk)\n- Turn 31: S (stay at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 32; safe)\n- Turn 32: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 33; safe, as turn 33 > 32)\n- Turn 33: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 34; safe)\n- Turn 34: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 35; target reached)\n\nThis sequence avoids collisions:\n- At turn 31, player is at \\(y = 6\\), which is safe.\n- At turn 32, player is at \\(y = 6\\), which is safe.\n- At all other turns, the player is on safe rows (\\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) or \\(y = 9\\)).\n\nNo shorter sequence is possible, as attempts to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 34 or earlier require being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at turns 31 or 32, causing a collision, or violate the movement constraints.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn 26: } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn 27: } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn 28: } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn 29: } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn 30: } S \\\\\n\\text{Turn 31: } S \\\\\n\\text{Turn 32: } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn 33: } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn 34: } U\n}",

The current turn is t_1=30, and I need to find a sequence of actions: U for up, D for down, or S for stay.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each turn and where they will be when I might be on their freeway.\n\nThe player moves on the y-axis, and the cars move on the x-axis. I start at y=6, and I need to reach y=9. Since y=9 is the top, I can only move up or down within 0 to 9. Moving up increases y, down decreases, stay keeps it the same.\n\nCollision happens if at turn T, I am on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, the car spans include x=0 at that turn. Because I'm at (0, y_T), so if x=0 is covered by a car on that row at turn T, I crash.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose to go to y_{T+1}. But at turn T, I'm still on y_T, so I only care about cars on y_T at turn T for collision. When I arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, I check for cars there at that turn.\n\nThe note says: if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T. Only at turn T+1 when I'm there.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I have car states at turn t_1=30.\n\nLet me list all cars for each freeway k from 1 to 8.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nSince it's right-moving, direction right means it's moving to the right, so head is greater than tail? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: span at t_1 is [τ, h] with τ < h I assume? In the table it says head and tail, but for right-moving, it says span(t_1) = [τ, h] and then at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] to [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn freeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 12). But -24 and -35, which is head and tail? It says \"head h, tail τ\", but for right-moving, if it's moving right, head should be on the right, so if tail is -35 and head is -24, since -24 > -35, so head is at -24, tail at -35, so the car is from x=-35 to x=-24, I think? Span.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail), but in the update, for right-moving, it's [τ, h] meaning from τ to h, with τ < h? In this case, tail τ = -35, head h = -24, so τ = -35, h = -24, so since h > τ, the car occupies from τ to h, which is from -35 to -24.\n\nThen for right-moving, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-35 + 12(T-30), -24 + 12(T-30)]\n\nSimilarly, for collision, we need if 0 is in [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] at turn T.\n\nNow, since it's right-moving and s=12, the car is moving to the right.\n\nAt turn T, the position is τ + s(T-30) to h + s(T-30) for the span.\n\n0 is in span if τ + s(T-30) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T-30)\n\nSince τ < h.\n\nHere τ = -35, h = -24, s=12.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision when:\n\n-35 + 12(T-30) ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 12(T-30)\n\nSolve for T.\n\nFirst inequality: -35 + 12(T-30) ≤ 0 => 12(T-30) ≤ 35 => T-30 ≤ 35/12 ≈ 2.916 => T ≤ 30 + 2.916 = 32.916, so T ≤ 32 since T integer? Turns are discrete, I assume T integer.\n\nt_1=30, T> t_1, so T=31,32,33,...\n\nT-30 integer, let Δt = T-30.\n\nSo for freeway 1:\n\n-35 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -24 + 12 Δt\n\nFirst: -35 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 => 12 Δt ≤ 35 => Δt ≤ 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so Δt ≤ 2\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -24 + 12 Δt => 24 ≤ 12 Δt => Δt ≥ 24/12 = 2\n\nSo Δt ≥ 2 and Δt ≤ 2, so Δt=2\n\nThus collision at T=30 + 2 = 32, only when Δt=2.\n\nAt T=32, the span is [-35 + 12*2, -24 + 12*2] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0], so yes, 0 is included.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nNow freeway 2: (36, 25, right, 6)\n\nBut (head, tail) = (36,25), and direction right.\n\nIf head is 36, tail is 25, but 36 > 25, so for right-moving, span should be [tail, head] = [25,36]? In the update rule, it says for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ should be tail, h head.\n\nHere τ=25, h=36? But in the table it says (36,25), which might be (head, tail), so head=36, tail=25.\n\nSince direction right, and head=36, tail=25, with 36>25, so the car is from x=25 to x=36.\n\nAt T, span: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [25 + 6(Δt), 36 + 6(Δt)] where Δt = T-30\n\nCollision when 0 in [25 + 6Δt, 36 + 6Δt]\n\nBut 25 + 6Δt > 0 for Δt ≥ 0, since min at Δt=0 is 25>0, so the left end is 25 + 6Δt ≥25 >0, so 0 is never in the interval because the span is always positive, above 0. So no collision ever on freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as 2, (36,25,right,6), same thing, no collision.\n\nFreeway 4: same.\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nNow freeway 7: multiple cars: (36,25,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (36,25,right,6), same as above, no collision.\n\nSecond car: (-42,-53,right,6), head=-42? Tail=-53? head=-42, tail=-53, since -42 > -53, so tail τ=-53, head h=-42.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-53, -42] for right-moving.\n\nAt T: [ -53 + 6Δt, -42 + 6Δt ]\n\nCollision when -53 + 6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -42 + 6Δt\n\nFirst: -53 + 6Δt ≤ 0 => 6Δt ≤ 53 => Δt ≤ 53/6 ≈ 8.833, so Δt ≤ 8\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -42 + 6Δt => 42 ≤ 6Δt => Δt ≥ 42/6 = 7\n\nSo Δt ≥7 and Δt ≤8, so Δt=7 or 8.\n\nAt Δt=7: span [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt Δt=8: [-53+48, -42+48] = [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nNow third car on freeway 7: (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nHead=-6, tail=-17, tail τ=-17, head h=-6.\n\nSpan at T: [ -17 + 6Δt, -6 + 6Δt ]\n\nCollision when -17 + 6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -6 + 6Δt\n\nFirst: -17 + 6Δt ≤ 0 => 6Δt ≤ 17 => Δt ≤ 17/6 ≈ 2.833, so Δt ≤ 2\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -6 + 6Δt => 6 ≤ 6Δt => Δt ≥ 1\n\nSo Δt=1 or 2.\n\nAt Δt=1: span [-17+6, -6+6] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt Δt=2: [-17+12, -6+12] = [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nNow freeway 8: same cars as freeway 7: (36,25,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6)\n\n(36,25,right,6) no collision.\n\n(-42,-53,right,6): collision at Δt=7,8\n\n(-6,-17,right,6): collision at Δt=1,2\n\nNow, for freeway 1, we have collision only at T=32 (Δt=2)\n\nBut freeway 1 is y=1, I think k is the freeway index, so y=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer at t_1=30 is at y=6.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nSince I start at y=6, and need to reach y=9, I need to move up at least 3 times. But I might stay or move down to avoid cars, but moving down would take more turns, so probably not optimal to go down since I need to go up to 9.\n\nMinimal H should be 3 if I can go up directly, but I need to check if I can be on y=7,8,9 at certain turns without collision.\n\nNow, I need to plan the sequence of actions from t=30 onwards.\n\nLet me denote the turn from t=30.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position y_T, and I choose action a_T which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nBut at turn T, I am on y_T, so I need no collision on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nThen after action, at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, and check for that freeway at turn T+1.\n\nI start at T=30, y=6.\n\nAt T=30, I am on y=6. Is there collision on y=6?\n\nFreeway 6 has one car: (36,25,right,6), which we said no collision ever, since span min 25>0. So safe at T=30 on y=6.\n\nNow I need to choose action a_30: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go up, to y=7 at T=31.\n\nIf I stay, y=6 at T=31, etc.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nFirst, possible paths: I can go directly up: U,U,U to y=7,8,9 in three moves.\n\nBut I need to check for collision on each freeway at the time I am there.\n\nAt T=30, I am on y=6, no collision.\n\nThen after a_30, at T=31, I am on y_{31}, depending on action.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway and each possible turn when collision happens, so I know when to avoid being on that row.\n\nSince the cars move, the collision times are fixed for each row.\n\nFreeway y=1: collision only at T=32 (Δt=2)\n\ny=2: no collision\n\ny=3: no collision\n\ny=4: no collision\n\ny=5: no collision\n\ny=6: no collision (since the car is always away from 0)\n\ny=7: has three cars, but the (36,25) one no collision, but others:\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nCar 1: (-42,-53,right,6): collision at Δt=7,8 i.e. T=37,38\n\nCar 2: (-6,-17,right,6): collision at Δt=1,2 i.e. T=31,32\n\nAlso the first car no issue.\n\nSo on y=7, collision at T=31 and T=32 (from car 2), and T=37,38 (from car 1)\n\nSimilarly, freeway y=8: same as y=7, collision at T=31,32 from one car, and T=37,38 from another.\n\ny=8: cars same as y=7: (36,25,no coll), (-42,-53,right,6) coll at T=37,38, and (-6,-17,right,6) coll at T=31,32.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=6 to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: I can move up, down, or stay.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should move up as much as possible, but avoid being on a row when collision happens.\n\nStart at T=30, y=6, safe.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=9 at some T.\n\nSince y=9 is the target, and no cars on y=9? Freeways are y=1 to 8, y=9 has no freeway? The vertical axis y=0,1,2,...,9, but freeways for cars are y=1 to 8, I think. y=0 and y=9 might be safe, but let's see the problem.\n\n\"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8\", so I think y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so when I am on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible. But I need to reach (0,9), which is y=9.\n\nAlso, when I am on y=0 or y=9, since no freeway, no car, so always safe.\n\nBut at turn T, if y_T=0 or 9, no collision.\n\nNow, the player position: at turn T, I am at (0, y_T), and if y_T between 1 and 8, I need to check cars on that row.\n\nIf y_T=0 or 9, no issue.\n\nNow, I start at y=6 at T=30.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nMinimal H: if I go U at T=30, to y=7 at T=31.\n\nThen at T=31, I am on y=7.\n\nBut on y=7, at T=31, there is collision because of the car (-6,-17) at Δt=1, T=31.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=7 at T=31, I collide.\n\nIf I stay at T=30, S, then at T=31, I am still on y=6.\n\ny=6 is safe at all times, no collision.\n\nThen at T=31, I can choose action.\n\nIf I go up to y=7 at T=32.\n\nBut at T=32, on y=7, there is collision from the same car at T=32.\n\ny=7 collision at T=31 and T=32.\n\nSo if I am on y=7 at T=31 or T=32, I collide.\n\nNow, when can I be on y=7 safely?\n\ny=7 has collision only at T=31,32,37,38.\n\nSo safe at other times, like T=30,33,34,35,36, etc.\n\nBut at T=30, I am at y=6, not y=7.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 has collision at T=31,32,37,38.\n\ny=8 same as y=7.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9, which is safe always.\n\nNow, from y=6, I can go up to y=7, but only when y=7 is safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSince I need to pass through y=7 and y=8 to reach y=9, unless I jump, but I move one step at a time.\n\ny from 6 to 7 to 8 to 9, or I could stay or go down, but that would take more turns.\n\nBut to avoid collision, I might need to wait.\n\nFor example, if I go up at a time when y=7 is safe.\n\ny=7 safe when not T=31,32,37,38.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, at T=30, I am at y=6.\n\nIf I do nothing, stay at T=30, I remain at y=6 at T=31.\n\nThen at T=31, I can go up to y=7, but at T=31, y=7 has collision, so if I go to y=7 at T=31, I arrive at T=31, so I am on y=7 at T=31, collide.\n\nIf I stay at T=31 on y=6, then at T=32, if I go to y=7, at T=32, y=7 has collision, so arrive at T=32, on y=7, collide.\n\nIf I stay on y=6 until T=33.\n\nAt T=33, I am on y=6, safe.\n\nThen I can go up to y=7 at T=33.\n\nAt T=33, what is y=7? T=33, Δt=3.\n\ny=7 collision times: T=31,32,37,38, so T=33 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at T=33: collision at T=31,32,37,38, so T=33 safe.\n\nAt T=33, I am on y=6, choose a_33, say U, then y_{34} =7.\n\nAt turn T=33, I am on y=6, no issue.\n\nAfter action, at T=34, I am on y=7.\n\nNow, at T=34, y=7: Δt=4, not collision time (31,32,37,38), so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=34, I can choose to go up to y=8 at T=35.\n\na_34 = U, then y_{35} =8.\n\nAt T=35, on y=8.\n\ny=8 at T=35: Δt=5, not 31,32,37,38, so safe.\n\nThen at T=35, I can go up to y=9 at T=36.\n\na_35 = U, y_{36} =9.\n\nAt T=36, on y=9, which is safe, no cars.\n\nSo I reach y=9 at T=36.\n\nNow, from T=30 to T=36, that's 6 turns? Let's see the sequence.\n\nStart at T=30, y=6.\n\nI need to specify actions from t_1=30 onwards.\n\nAt T=30, I can choose to stay or move.\n\nIn this plan, I stayed on y=6 until T=33, then moved up.\n\nBut I can start moving earlier if possible.\n\nAt T=30, I am at y=6.\n\nIf I go up at T=30 to y=7 at T=31, but at T=31, y=7 has collision, so not possible.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down to y=5 at T=31, but y=5 is freeway, let's check y=5.\n\nFreeway 5: (36,25,right,6), no collision, always safe.\n\nBut going down to y=5 at T=31 might not help, since I need to go up to 9.\n\nFor example, if at T=30 I go down to y=5 at T=31.\n\nAt T=31, on y=5, safe, no collision.\n\nThen I can go up to y=6 at T=32, etc., but that might take more turns.\n\nSince I need to be at y=9, and y=6 to y=9 is 3 steps, but with delays.\n\nIn my first plan, I stayed at y=6 for a few turns.\n\nFrom T=30 to T=36, with actions.\n\nT=30: at y=6, I can choose S (stay), so y_{31} =6.\n\nThen T=31: at y=6, choose S, y_{32}=6.\n\nT=32: at y=6, choose S, y_{33}=6.\n\nT=33: at y=6, choose U, so y_{34}=7.\n\nT=34: at y=7, choose U, y_{35}=8.\n\nT=35: at y=8, choose U, y_{36}=9.\n\nAt T=36, y=9, reached.\n\nH is the number of turns from t_1, so from turn 30 to 35, actions at t=30 to 35, and at t=35, after action, y=9 at t=36? Let's clarify.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t, I perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nI start at turn t_1=30, y=6.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, say at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H-1 actions, I am at y=9.\n\nDefine: let t from 0 to H-1, but relative to t_1.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, I am at y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t_1, I am at y_{t_1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1 +1, I am at y_{t_1 +1}.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + k}, at turn t_1 + k +1, I am at y_{t_1 + k +1}.\n\nI need y_{t_1 + H} =9 for some H.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and after that, at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + H is 9.\n\nIn terms of time, from start turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H, with H turns elapsed? Turns: at turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t_1, y=6.\n\nAfter first action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1 +1, y_{t_1+1}.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k, y_{t_1 + k}.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn t_1 + H, I need to perform H actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe minimal such H.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for turn t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn my plan, I want to be at y=9 at T=36.\n\nT=36 is turn 36, which is t_1 + 6, since t_1=30, 30+6=36.\n\nSo H=6, meaning actions from t=30 to t=35? Let's index.\n\nSet τ = t - t_1, so at τ=0, turn 30, y=6.\n\nAfter action a_0, at τ=1, turn 31, y_{31}.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{k-1}, at τ=k, turn t_1 + k, y.\n\nI need y at τ=H to be 9.\n\nWith actions a_0 to a_{H-1}.\n\nIn the answer, it should be for turn t_1, t_1+1, etc.\n\nIn my plan: to be at y=9 at τ=6 (turn 36).\n\nSo actions from τ=0 to τ=5 (turn 30 to 35).\n\nAt τ=0 (t=30): I am at y=6, I choose action.\n\nIf I choose S, then at τ=1 (t=31), y=6.\n\nSimilarly, choose S at τ=1, y=6 at τ=2 (t=32)\n\nS at τ=2, y=6 at τ=3 (t=33)\n\nThen at τ=3 (t=33), at y=6, choose U, so y at τ=4 (t=34) =7\n\nThen at τ=4 (t=34), at y=7, choose U, y at τ=5 (t=35) =8\n\nThen at τ=5 (t=35), at y=8, choose U, y at τ=6 (t=36) =9\n\nYes, reached at τ=6.\n\nH=6, actions for t=30 to 35.\n\nBut I have three S at the beginning, then U,U,U.\n\nCan I do it faster?\n\nFor example, at T=30, I could go down to y=5 to avoid or something, but let's see.\n\nAt T=30, y=6.\n\nIf I go down to y=5 at T=31.\n\nAt T=31, on y=5, safe.\n\nThen at T=31, I can go up to y=6 at T=32.\n\nAt T=32, on y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=32, I can go to y=7? But at T=32, y=7 has collision, so if I go to y=7 at T=32, I arrive at T=32, on y=7, collide.\n\nIf I stay on y=6 at T=32, then at T=33, go to y=7 as before.\n\nBut going down to y=5 and back doesn't help; it takes extra turns.\n\nAt T=31, on y=5, I could go directly to y=6, but same as before.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 or something directly, but I have to go through y=7.\n\nAnother idea: at T=30, since y=7 is safe at T=30, but I am not on y=7 at T=30, I am on y=6.\n\nAt T=30, I can only affect where I am at T=31.\n\nThe earliest I can be on y=7 is T=31, but at T=31, collision on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, T=32 collision.\n\nNext safe is T=33 or later.\n\nT=33 is safe for y=7.\n\nSo I have to wait until T=33 to move to y=7.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to be on y=6 until T=33, then move up.\n\nT=33 is when I am at y=6, and I move to y=7 at T=34.\n\nIn terms of actions: from T=30 to T=32, I stay on y=6, so actions S at T=30, S at T=31, S at T=32? Let's list turns.\n\nTurn t: action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nFor turn t=30: I am at y=6, I choose a_30.\n\nIf a_30 = S, then y_{31} =6.\n\nThen turn t=31: at y=6, choose a_31.\n\nIf a_31 = S, y_{32}=6.\n\nTurn t=32: at y=6, choose a_32.\n\nIf a_32 = S, y_{33}=6.\n\nBut I want to be at y=7 earlier.\n\nAt turn t=32: if I choose U, y_{33}=7.\n\nBut at turn t=33, I am at y=7.\n\nNow, t=33, which is Δt=3, safe for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=32 I choose U, y_{33}=7.\n\nThen at t=33, I am at y=7, safe.\n\nThen at t=33, choose U, y_{34}=8.\n\nAt t=34, at y=8, safe (since y=8 collision at 31,32,37,38, t=34 is safe).\n\nThen at t=34, choose U, y_{35}=9.\n\nAt t=35, at y=9, reached.\n\nNow, compare to previous plan.\n\nIn this case: actions:\n\nAt t=30: since I start at y=6, to stay, a_30 = S, so y_{31}=6\n\nt=31: at y=6, a_31 = S, y_{32}=6\n\nt=32: at y=6, a_32 = U, so y_{33}=7\n\nt=33: at y=7, a_33 = U, y_{34}=8\n\nt=34: at y=8, a_34 = U, y_{35}=9\n\nReached at t=35.\n\ny=9 at t=35.\n\nt=35 is turn 35, which is t_1 +5, since 30+5=35.\n\nH=5? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t_1=30, y=6.\n\nAfter actions: a_30, a_31, a_32, a_33, a_34.\n\nThat's 5 actions: t=30 to 34.\n\nAfter a_34, at turn t_1 + 5 =35, y=9.\n\nYes, H=5.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so for H=5, actions at t=30,31,32,33,34.\n\nAnd at turn t=35, y=9.\n\nIn the first plan I had to wait until t=33 to stay, then move, reaching at t=36 with H=6.\n\nBut now, by moving at t=32 to y=7 at t=33, I save one turn.\n\nNow, check the actions:\n\nt=30: a_30 = S, y remains 6 for t=31.\n\nt=31: a_31 = S, y remains 6 for t=32.\n\nt=32: a_32 = U, to y=7 at t=33.\n\nAt t=33, I am on y=7, which is safe since t=33 not collision time.\n\nThen t=33: a_33 = U, to y=8 at t=34.\n\nAt t=34, on y=8, safe (t=34 not 31,32,37,38).\n\nt=34: a_34 = U, to y=9 at t=35.\n\nYes.\n\nCan I do better? H=4?\n\nTo reach y=9 in fewer turns.\n\nMinimal is 3, but to go from 6 to 9, I need at least 3 up moves.\n\nBut I need to be on y=7 and y=8 at safe times.\n\nEarliest I can be on y=7 is t=31, but unsafe.\n\nNext is t=33.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 earliest safe is t=33 or later, since collision at 31,32.\n\nt=33 is safe for both.\n\nIn the above, I go to y=7 at t=33, then to y=8 at t=34, to y=9 at t=35.\n\nCan I be on y=8 at t=33? But to be on y=8 at t=33, I need to have been at y=7 or y=9 or something at t=32.\n\nAt t=32, if I am at y=7, but at t=32, y=7 has collision, so I cannot be on y=7 at t=32.\n\nIf I am at y=8 at t=32, but to be at y=8 at t=32, I need to have moved there earlier.\n\nAt t=31, if I am at y=7, collision; at y=8, at t=31, y=8 has collision.\n\ny=8 collision at t=31 and t=32.\n\nSo at t=31 and t=32, both y=7 and y=8 are unsafe.\n\nThus, I cannot be on them at those times.\n\nEarliest safe time for y=7 and y=8 is t=33.\n\nSo I must be on y=6 until t=32, then at t=32 I move to y=7 at t=33.\n\nThen proceed as above.\n\nIf I go to y=5, for example.\n\nAt t=30, go down to y=5 at t=31.\n\nAt t=31, on y=5, safe.\n\nThen at t=31, I can go to y=6 at t=32.\n\nAt t=32, on y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=32, I can go to y=7? But at t=32, if I go to y=7, arrive at t=33? No.\n\nAction at t=32 determines y_{33}.\n\nIf a_32 = U, y_{33}=7.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nIf at t=31, on y=5, I go up to y=6 at t=32, same.\n\nNo better.\n\nAt t=31, on y=5, I could go directly to y=7? But I can only change by +1, -1, or 0, so from y=5, I can go to y=4,5,6, not directly to 7.\n\nSo no, I have to go step by step.\n\nThus, minimal H is 5, with sequence:\n\nAt turn 30: S\n\nTurn 31: S\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nThen at turn 35, y=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, it should be for each turn.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nSo t_1=30.\n\nThus:\n\nTurn 30: S\n\nTurn 31: S\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nBut after a_34, at turn 35, y=9.\n\nIs there a sequence with H=4?\n\nSuppose I start at t=30, y=6.\n\nIf I go up at t=30 to y=7 at t=31, but collide at t=31 on y=7.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf I go down at t=30 to y=5 at t=31.\n\nAt t=31, on y=5, safe.\n\nThen at t=31, go up to y=6 at t=32.\n\nAt t=32, on y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=32, go up to y=7 at t=33.\n\nAs before.\n\nThen at t=33, on y=7, go up to y=8 at t=34.\n\nAt t=34, on y=8, go up to y=9 at t=35.\n\nSame as above, but I used D at t=30, then U at t=31, etc., but I reach at t=35 same, with actions: D at 30, U at 31, U at 32, U at 33? Let's see:\n\nt=30: a_30=D, so y_{31}=5\n\nt=31: at y=5, a_31=U, y_{32}=6\n\nt=32: at y=6, a_32=U, y_{33}=7\n\nt=33: at y=7, a_33=U, y_{34}=8\n\nt=34: at y=8, a_34=U, y_{35}=9\n\nSame t=35, but now I have an extra down and up, so more actions? H=5 actions: t=30 to 34.\n\nBut in this case, I have D,U,U,U,U, but I reach at same time, but with unnecessary down move.\n\nIn terms of H, it's the same, but the sequence has a down, which is not necessary, since staying is better.\n\nIn the first sequence with S,S,U,U,U, I reach at t=35 with y=9.\n\nSimilarly here, but with D instead of S at first, but y changes, but same arrival time.\n\nBut minimal actions, but since I need to specify actions, and H is the same, but S is better than D if possible.\n\nIn this case, with S I stay at y=6, which is safe, no need to go down.\n\nSo the S,S,U,U,U sequence is fine.\n\nCan I reach earlier? Suppose I go to y=8 directly or something, but no.\n\nAnother thought: at t=33, I go directly to y=9? But from y=7, I can only go to y=6,7,8, not to 9 directly.\n\nSo I have to go through y=8.\n\nThus, minimal H is 5.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=34, I go to y=9 at t=35.\n\nBut y=9 is safe, no issue.\n\nNow, but I need to confirm for y=8 at t=34.\n\ny=8 collision times: T=31,32,37,38.\n\nt=34 is not among them, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, I think I covered.\n\nBut freeway 1 has collision at t=32, but I am not on y=1, so irrelevant.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, I have three S? No, in the minimal sequence: actions at t=30: S, t=31: S, t=32: U, t=33: U, t=34: U.\n\nt=30: S, so y=6 at t=31\n\nt=31: S, y=6 at t=32\n\nt=32: U, y=7 at t=33\n\nt=33: U, y=8 at t=34\n\nt=34: U, y=9 at t=35\n\nYes.\n\nSince I need to be at y=6 until t=32, I can only start moving at t=32.\n\nAt t=32, I move to y=7 at t=33.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=34, to y=9 at t=35.\n\nNo faster way.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=9 earlier if I start from lower, but no.\n\nSo H=5.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, I have multiple cars, but I think I have the collision times correct.\n\nFreeway 7: cars that cause collision: the (-6,-17,right,6) at T=31,32\n\nAnd (-42,-53,right,6) at T=37,38\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nNo other cars cause issues.\n\nAnd y=6 always safe.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 30: S\n\nTurn 31: S\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nAfter that, at turn 35, position (0,9).\n\nH=5 turns of actions.\n\nThe problem says \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIs there a sequence with H=4?\n\nSuppose at t=30: U, but to y=7 at t=31, collide.\n\nNot possible.\n\nt=30: D, to y=5 at t=31.\n\nt=31: U, to y=6 at t=32.\n\nt=32: U, to y=7 at t=33.\n\nt=33: U, to y=8 at t=34.\n\nThen at t=34, I am at y=8, need another action to go to y=9 at t=35.\n\nStill H=5 actions to reach at t=35.\n\nIf at t=33, I am at y=7, I can only go to y=8, not directly to 9.\n\nSo impossible to reach before t=35.\n\nThus minimal H=5.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nAlso, I need to box the answer.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 30: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }\n\nIn the text, it should be written.\n\nSince it's a sequence.\n\nIn the problem, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so for each turn.\n\nNow, I think that's it.\n\nBut let me confirm the collision at t=33 for y=7.\n\nt=33, Δt=3.\n\nFor the car (-6,-17,right,6) on y=7: at Δt=3, span: [ -17 + 6*3, -6 + 6*3 ] = [ -17+18, -6+18] = [1,12], which is from 1 to 12, so x=0 not included, safe.\n\nSimilarly, the other car (-42,-53,right,6): at Δt=3, [ -53 + 18, -42 + 18] = [-35, -24], all negative, 0 not included.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 same.\n\nAt t=34, y=8: Δt=4.\n\nCar (-6,-17): [ -17 + 24, -6 + 24] = [7,18], 0 not in.\n\n(-42,-53): [ -53+24, -42+24] = [-29,-18], 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nAnd at t=35, y=9, no cars.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo this should be minimal.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 6)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 30\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined to be optimal, requiring \\(H = 5\\) turns (actions from turn 30 to turn 34, with position \\((0, 9)\\) reached at turn 35).\n\n### Key Constraints and Reasoning:\n- **Player Movement**: The player can move up (U, increasing \\(y\\) by 1), down (D, decreasing \\(y\\) by 1), or stay (S, no change in \\(y\\)). The vertical position \\(y\\) must stay within \\([0, 9]\\).\n- **Collision Avoidance**: Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) only if the player is on a freeway \\(y_T \\in \\{1, \\dots, 8\\}\\) and the span of any car on that freeway includes \\(x = 0\\) at turn \\(T\\).\n- **Initial Position and Target**: Start at \\((0, 6)\\) at turn 30. Target \\((0, 9)\\) must be reached, where \\(y = 9\\) has no cars and is always safe.\n- **Car Collision Times**:\n  - Freeway \\(y = 1\\): Collision only at turn 32 (from car \\((-24, -35, \\text{right}, 12)\\)).\n  - Freeway \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\): No collisions at any turn (cars always away from \\(x = 0\\)).\n  - Freeway \\(y = 7\\): Collisions at turns 31 and 32 (from car \\((-6, -17, \\text{right}, 6)\\)) and turns 37 and 38 (from car \\((-42, -53, \\text{right}, 6)\\)). Safe at all other turns (e.g., turns 33, 34, 35, 36).\n  - Freeway \\(y = 8\\): Collisions at turns 31 and 32 (from car \\((-6, -17, \\text{right}, 6)\\)) and turns 37 and 38 (from car \\((-42, -53, \\text{right}, 6)\\)). Safe at all other turns (e.g., turns 33, 34, 35, 36).\n\n### Path to Minimize Turns:\n- The minimal path requires moving from \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 9\\), which takes at least 3 up (U) actions. However, due to collisions on \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) at turns 31 and 32, the player must delay moving upward until turn 32.\n- **Turn 30 (\\(y = 6\\))**: Safe (no collision). Staying (S) keeps the player at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 31, avoiding the collision on \\(y = 7\\) at turn 31.\n- **Turn 31 (\\(y = 6\\))**: Safe (no collision). Staying (S) keeps the player at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 32, avoiding the collision on \\(y = 7\\) at turn 32.\n- **Turn 32 (\\(y = 6\\))**: Safe (no collision). Moving up (U) transitions to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 33, which is safe (no collision on \\(y = 7\\) at turn 33).\n- **Turn 33 (\\(y = 7\\))**: Safe (no collision). Moving up (U) transitions to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 34, which is safe (no collision on \\(y = 8\\) at turn 34).\n- **Turn 34 (\\(y = 8\\))**: Safe (no collision). Moving up (U) transitions to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 35.\n- **Turn 35 (\\(y = 9\\))**: Position \\((0, 9)\\) reached; no cars on \\(y = 9\\), so safe.\n\nThis sequence uses \\(H = 5\\) actions (turns 30 to 34) and reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 35. No shorter sequence is possible:\n- Attempting to move up at turn 30 or 31 would place the player on \\(y = 7\\) at turn 31 or 32, causing collision.\n- Moving down (e.g., to \\(y = 5\\)) adds unnecessary actions and does not reduce the number of turns.\n- The earliest safe turn to be on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) is turn 33 or later, making turn 35 the earliest possible arrival at \\(y = 9\\).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe minimal sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 30: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0. The grid has y from 0 to 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The note says that when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn, so I only care about the cars on the row I'm currently on when I'm there.\n\nCurrent turn is t₁ = 33. Player is at y=7.\n\nNow, the car states:\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, (head=12, tail=1, direction=right, speed=12). Since it's right-moving, span at time t is [τ + s(t - t₁), h + s(t - t₁)], but t₁ is 33, so let's define the time relative to t₁.\n\nSet τ = t - t₁, so at relative time τ=0, which is turn t₁, we have the initial spans.\n\nFor freeway 1: right-moving, head=12, tail=1, speed=12. So at τ=0, span is [1,12]? Direction is right, so for right-moving, head is greater than tail, I think. The update says: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)], and at T=t₁, it should be [τ, h], so if tail=1, head=12, then at t₁, span is [1,12] for right-moving? But in the table, it says (head, tail, dir, speed), and for dir right, head should be the front, so larger number, tail smaller.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, head and tail might be different.\n\nIn this case, all cars seem to be right-moving except one on freeway 7 and 8, but let's list all.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=12, tail=1, dir=right, speed=12). So at τ=0, span is [1,12] since right-moving.\n\nThe span is inclusive, I assume.\n\nNow freeway 2: (54,43,right,6) — head=54, tail=43, so at τ=0, span [43,54] right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as 2? (54,43,right,6) — is this a different car or same? It says \"Cars\" so probably multiple, but for each freeway, it lists the cars.\n\nLooking at freeway 7 and 8, it has three cars each, so for freeways 2 to 6, it might be one car each, but it says \"Cars\" and for 1 it's one, for 2 it's one, etc., but for 7 and 8 it has three listed.\n\nIn the table:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars (head, tail, dir, speed) |\n\nFor k=1: (12,1,right,12) — one car\n\nk=2: (54,43,right,6) — one car\n\nSimilarly k=3 to k=6: each has (54,43,right,6) — but that might be a mistake or it's the same car? No, each freeway has its own cars, so for each, it's listed separately, but the values are the same for k=2 to6? That seems odd, but possible.\n\nk=7: three cars: (54,43,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), (12,1,right,6)\n\nk=8: same three: (54,43,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), (12,1,right,6)\n\nBut for k=1, it's (12,1,right,12), different speed.\n\nI think I need to handle each freeway separately.\n\nFirst, the player starts at y=7, which is freeway 7? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=7 is freeway 7.\n\nAt turn t₁=33, player is at (0,7), so on freeway 7.\n\nNow, I need to avoid collisions when on a freeway.\n\nCollision if at turn T, y_T = k for some k=1 to8, and 0 is in the span of any car on freeway k at time T.\n\nTime T is absolute or relative?\n\nSet t as absolute turn number, but since we start from t₁, use τ = t - t₁.\n\nSo at τ=0, turn t₁, player is at y=7.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some τ=H, so after H turns, position at turn t₁ + H should be (0,9), but the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so after H actions, we are at turn t₁ + H, position y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_t for t=t₁ to t₁+H-1.\n\nAfter action a_{t₁ + H-1}, we have y_{t₁ + H}, and we want y_{t₁ + H} = 9.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nNow, y starts at 7, and we need to go to 9, so we need to move up at least twice, but since we can stay or move, it might take more turns if we have to avoid cars.\n\nBut y=9 is not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to8, so when we are at y=9, we are not on any freeway, so no collision possible. Similarly, y=0 is not a freeway? The vertical axis is y=0,1,2,...,9, and freeways are y=1 to8 for cars. So y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nCollision only on y=1 to8.\n\nIn this case, starting from y=7, need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and it's safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to be at y=8 and then move up, or at y=9 directly, but since we move step by step, we need to pass through y=8 at some point.\n\nWhen we are on y=8, we need to avoid collision with cars on freeway 8.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay or move on other freeways.\n\nSince we start at y=7, and need to go to y=9, the direct way is to go up twice: U then U, but we need to check if at the times we are on y=7 and y=8, there is no collision.\n\nWe might need to delay or move down if necessary, but moving down might not help since we need to go up eventually.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when a car is present at x=0.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, at time τ (relative to t₁=33), the span for x=0.\n\nCollision if at time τ, for freeway k, 0 is in the span of some car.\n\nThe span changes with time.\n\nFor a right-moving car, span at time τ: since τ = t - t₁, t = t₁ + τ.\n\nAt time t, span is [τ + s τ, h + s τ]? Let's see.\n\nFrom the update: at time T, span = [τ + s (T - t₁), h + s (T - t₁)] for right-moving, but τ and h are at t₁.\n\nIn the notation, at T=t₁, span is [τ, h] for right-moving, where τ is tail, h is head.\n\nThen at T, it becomes [τ + s (T - t₁), h + s (T - t₁)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h - s (T - t₁), τ - s (T - t₁)]\n\nIn this problem, all cars seem to be right-moving, from the data.\n\nFreeway 1: (12,1,right,12) so tail=1, head=12, speed=12, right.\n\nAt time τ, span = [1 + 12τ, 12 + 12τ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (54,43,right,6) tail=43, head=54, speed=6\n\nAt τ, span = [43 + 6τ, 54 + 6τ]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3,4,5,6: each has (54,43,right,6), so same as freeway 2? But different freeways, so each has its own car with same parameters? That might be, or it's a typo? I think we have to take as is, so for each of k=2,3,4,5,6, there is a car with tail=43, head=54, speed=6, so span at τ: [43 + 6τ, 54 + 6τ]\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars:\n\nFirst: (54,43,right,6) so [43 + 6τ, 54 + 6τ]\n\nSecond: (-24,-35,right,6) head=-24, tail=-35? Direction right, so tail should be less than head? -35 < -24, yes, tail=-35, head=-24.\n\nAt τ, span = [τ + s τ, h + s τ] = [-35 + 6τ, -24 + 6τ]\n\nThird: (12,1,right,6) [1 + 6τ, 12 + 6τ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same three cars: (54,43,right,6) [43+6τ,54+6τ], (-24,-35,right,6) [-35+6τ,-24+6τ], (12,1,right,6) [1+6τ,12+6τ]\n\nNow, for freeway 1, it's different: (12,1,right,12) [1+12τ, 12+12τ]\n\nPlayer starts at y=7 at τ=0.\n\nWe need to find when we can be on which row without collision.\n\nCollision on freeway k at time τ if for some car on k, 0 is in the span.\n\nThat is, min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nSince the span is an interval.\n\nFor freeway 7 at time τ, we have three spans:\n\nCar1: [43+6τ, 54+6τ]\n\nSince 43+6τ >=43 >0 for τ>=0, so min=43+6τ >0, so 0 is never in this span, since min>0.\n\nSimilarly, max=54+6τ >0, but min>0, so 0 not in [43+6τ,54+6τ] for any τ.\n\nSimilarly, car2: [-35+6τ, -24+6τ]\n\nNow, min = -35+6τ, max = -24+6τ.\n\n0 is in this span if min <=0 <= max, so -35+6τ <=0 and 0 <= -24+6τ.\n\nFirst inequality: -35+6τ <=0 => 6τ <=35 => τ <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -24+6τ => 6τ >=24 => τ >=4\n\nSo for τ between 4 and 5.833, 0 is in this span.\n\nτ is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nτ = t - t₁, integer, τ=0,1,2,...\n\nSo τ=4,5,6? τ=4: min=-35+24= -11, max=-24+24=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included? Since it says \"0 in span\", and span is inclusive, I think.\n\nSimilarly, τ=5: min=-35+30= -5, max=-24+30=6, [ -5,6], includes 0.\n\nτ=6: min=-35+36=1, max=-24+36=12, [1,12], min=1>0, so 0 not included.\n\nτ=3: min=-35+18= -17, max=-24+18= -6, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo for car2, 0 in span when τ=4 or 5.\n\nNow car3: [1+6τ, 12+6τ], min=1+6τ >=1>0 for τ>=0, so never contains 0.\n\nTherefore, on freeway 7, collision possible only from car2 at τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nAt other times, no collision on freeway 7.\n\nNow freeway 8: similarly, three cars.\n\nFirst car: (54,43,right,6) [43+6τ,54+6τ], min>0, never 0.\n\nSecond car: (-24,-35,right,6) [-35+6τ,-24+6τ], same as above, 0 in span when τ=4,5.\n\nThird car: (12,1,right,6) [1+6τ,12+6τ], min>0, never 0.\n\nSo on freeway 8, collision at τ=4 and τ=5 from the second car.\n\nNow other freeways: we might not need, but let's see.\n\nFreeway 1: car [1+12τ,12+12τ], min=1+12τ >=1>0, never 0.\n\nFreeway 2: car [43+6τ,54+6τ], min>0, never 0.\n\nSimilarly for 3,4,5,6: all same as 2, min>0, never collision.\n\nSo only freeway 7 and 8 have possible collisions at τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nSpecifically, on freeway 7, unsafe at τ=4,5\n\nOn freeway 8, unsafe at τ=4,5\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nNow, player starts at τ=0, y=7.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some time.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nTo reach y=9, we must be at y=8 at some turn and move up, or be at y=9 directly, but from y=8 we move up to y=9.\n\nThe position changes after action.\n\nAt time τ, after action a_τ, we have y_{τ+1}, but let's clarify the timing.\n\nDefine the state at the beginning of turn.\n\nTurn t₁ + τ for τ=0,1,2,...\n\nAt the start of turn t₁ + τ, player has position y_{t₁ + τ}\n\nThen player chooses action a_{t₁ + τ}, which determines Δy for that turn.\n\nThen y_{t₁ + τ + 1} = y_{t₁ + τ} + Δy\n\nAnd collision is checked at the end of the turn or during?\n\nThe collision rule: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\"\n\ny_T is the position at turn T, I think.\n\n\"at turn T, you are on freeway y_T\"\n\nAnd collision if 0 in span of car on that freeway at time T.\n\nTime T is the turn number.\n\nSo at turn T, when player is at position (0, y_T), and if y_T between 1 and 8, and for freeway k=y_T, there is a car with 0 in span at time T.\n\nThen collision.\n\nNow, the note: when you move to a new row, at turn T, you are on y_T, and if you move, at turn T, you are still on y_T, and y_{T+1} will be different, but at turn T, you are on y_T.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nSo at turn T, you are on y_T, and collision depends on cars on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nIf you move, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nIn this case, for us, at each turn τ (relative), time t = t₁ + τ.\n\nPosition y_τ at time τ.\n\nWe start at τ=0, y=7.\n\nWe need to have y_H = 9 at some H.\n\nMin H.\n\nNow, from y=7 to y=9, minimum two steps: U,U to go directly.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on y=7 at τ=4 or 5 if possible, or on y=8 at τ=4 or 5.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 are both unsafe at τ=4 and 5.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt time τ, if y_τ =7, and τ=4 or 5, collision because freeway 7 has car at 0.\n\nSimilarly, if y_τ =8 and τ=4 or 5, collision on freeway 8.\n\nAt other times, no collision on these freeways.\n\nFor other freeways, no collision possible, as we saw.\n\nNow, we start at τ=0, y=7.\n\nτ=0: y=7, is it safe? At τ=0, freeway 7: from earlier, at τ=0, car2 span [-35, -24], both negative, 0 not in, and other cars not, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, τ=1,2,3,6,7,... should be safe except τ=4,5.\n\nAt τ=0: let's confirm freeway 7 at τ=0:\n\ncar1: [43,54] not contain 0\n\ncar2: [-35,-24] not contain 0\n\ncar3: [1,12] not contain 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, τ=1: car2 span [-35+6= -29, -24+6= -18] negative, no.\n\nτ=2: [-35+12= -23, -24+12= -12] no\n\nτ=3: [-35+18= -17, -24+18= -6] no\n\nτ=4: [-35+24= -11, -24+24=0] [ -11,0], contains 0\n\nτ=5: [-35+30= -5, -24+30=6] [ -5,6], contains 0\n\nτ=6: [-35+36=1, -24+36=12] [1,12] no\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, player at τ=0, y=7, safe.\n\nWe can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf we go up, to y=8 at τ=1.\n\nIf down, to y=6, but y=6 is freeway 6, which has a car [43+6τ,54+6τ], min>0, never collision, so safe at all times.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,4,3,2,1 all have cars with min>0, so always safe, except we don't need to go down.\n\nBut going down might delay.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nIdeal: at τ=0, at y=7, move U to y=8 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, at y=8, if safe, move U to y=9 at τ=2.\n\nBut at τ=1, y=8, is it safe?\n\nτ=1, freeway 8: cars same as freeway 7 but on row 8.\n\nAt τ=1:\n\ncar1: [43+6=49,54+6=60] no\n\ncar2: [-35+6= -29, -24+6= -18] no\n\ncar3: [1+6=7,12+6=18] no, all not contain 0, so safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=8, move U to y=9 at τ=2.\n\ny=9 is not freeway, so at τ=2, position y=9, no collision.\n\nBut we need to check if at τ=1, when we are on y=8, it is safe, which it is at τ=1.\n\nτ=1 is not 4 or 5, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=0, we are on y=7, safe.\n\nSo with two moves: U at τ=0, U at τ=1, we reach y=9 at τ=2.\n\nH=2 turns.\n\nThe sequence: from τ=0 to H-1, actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t₁ + H.\n\nHere, actions at τ=0 and τ=1, so H=2, we reach at τ=2.\n\nBut let's confirm the times.\n\nAt turn t₁ + 0: position y=7, choose action a_{t₁}\n\nIf a_{t₁} = U, then y_{t₁ +1} = 7 +1 =8\n\nThen at turn t₁ +1: position y=8, choose action a_{t₁ +1}\n\nIf a_{t₁ +1} = U, then y_{t₁ +2} =8+1=9\n\nNow, collision: at turn t₁ +0: y=7, time T=t₁ +0, check freeway 7 at time T=t₁. Since τ=0, as above, safe.\n\nAt turn t₁ +1: y=8, time T=t₁ +1, which is τ=1, freeway 8 at τ=1, safe as above.\n\nThen at turn t₁ +2: y=9, not on freeway, no collision.\n\nSo in 2 turns, we reach.\n\nBut is there a problem at τ=4 or 5? We are not there at those times.\n\nWe are at τ=0 and τ=1 only, then at τ=2 we are at y=9.\n\nτ=4 and 5 are later, not relevant.\n\nSo minimal H should be 2.\n\nBut let's see the car on freeway 7 and 8 at other times, but we don't care.\n\nPerhaps I misread.\n\nAnother thing: on freeway 7, at τ=4 and 5, unsafe, but we are not on it at that time.\n\nSimilarly for 8.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=7 at τ=0, safe; y=8 at τ=1, safe.\n\nThen done.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do.\n\nBut let's see if we need to avoid something.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8, at τ=1, it is safe, but let's list the span.\n\nAt τ=1, freeway 8:\n\ncar1: [43+6*1=49, 54+6=60] no\n\ncar2: [-35+6= -29, -24+6= -18] no\n\ncar3: [1+6=7,12+6=18] no, all not contain 0.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=0, freeway 7: as before.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nBut why is there a car with negative positions? But mathematically, it should be ok.\n\nPerhaps the grid is circular or something? But no, the update is linear, so positions can be negative or large, but x=0 is fixed.\n\nSo I think H=2 is possible.\n\nBut the answer should be in sequence.\n\nTurn t₁: action\n\nTurn t₁+1: action\n\netc.\n\nt₁=33.\n\nSo actions: at turn 33: U\n\nAt turn 34: U\n\nThen at turn 35, position y=9.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so H=2 actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me confirm if at τ=0, y=7 is freeway 7, and we need to check cars.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH is the number of turns, which is the number of actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we reach.\n\nIn this case H=2.\n\nBut is there a reason we cannot do this?\n\nAnother thing: when we move from y=7 to y=8 at turn τ=0, at that turn, we are on y=7, not on y=8 until next turn.\n\nBut in the collision, at turn T, we are on y_T.\n\nIn this case, at turn T=33 (τ=0), y=7, on freeway 7, safe.\n\nAction U, so at turn T=34 (τ=1), y=8, on freeway 8, safe.\n\nThen action U, at turn T=35 (τ=2), y=9, not freeway.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider if we stay or something, but no need.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 7 with (12,1,right,6) at τ=0: [1,12], which includes x=0? 1 to 12, 0 is not between 1 and 12, since 1>0? 1 to 12, min=1, max=12, so 0 not in [1,12], since 1>0.\n\nOnly if min<=0<=max, but min=1>0, so 0 not <= max but min>0, so not included.\n\nSimilarly, at other times.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the car list for freeway 7, at τ=0, car3 is (12,1,right,6), [1,12], not contain 0.\n\nOnly car2 can contain 0 at certain times.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo minimal H=2 with actions U, U.\n\nBut the sequence: from t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nSo for t_1=33:\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut the player reaches (0,9) at turn 35.\n\nBut H=2.\n\nPerhaps we can do it in one turn? From y=7 to y=9 in one action? But actions only change by +1,0,-1, so cannot jump directly. Must go through y=8.\n\nSo minimum two actions: one to go to y=8, one to go to y=9.\n\nAnd in this case, it works.\n\nBut why is there freeway 1 with high speed? But we never go there.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8 at τ=1, but safe.\n\nAnother thought: at τ=1, on freeway 8, car3 is [7,18], which does not contain 0, so safe.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we delay.\n\nBut no need, since we can go directly.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoid collisions\", and we do.\n\nBut let me see if at τ=0, if we do something else, but no.\n\nPerhaps the cars on multiple freeways, but we only care when we are on it.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo minimal H=2.\n\nSequence: a_{33} = U, a_{34} = U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the answer should be in the format.\n\nAlso, H=2.\n\nBut let me write.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nNow, the current turn is t_1=33, player at (0,7).\n\nAfter actions, reach (0,9).\n\nSo I think that's it.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there is a car (12,1,right,6), at τ=0, [1,12], and 1 to 12, but x=0 not included, so ok.\n\nIf it was [0,12], it would include, but min=1>0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think no issue.\n\nPerhaps the direction: right-moving, head at higher x, tail lower, so for (12,1,right), head=12, tail=1, so from 1 to 12.\n\nYes.\n\nSo collision only if 0 in [min,max], inclusive.\n\nHere not.\n\nSo for the sequence.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 33\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis\n- The player starts at \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 33\\) (relative time \\(\\tau = 0\\)).\n- Freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) have cars, but collision only occurs if at turn \\(T\\), the player is on a freeway \\(k\\) (where \\(1 \\leq k \\leq 8\\)) and \\(x = 0\\) is within the span of any car on freeway \\(k\\) at that turn.\n- After evaluating all freeways:\n  - Freeways 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 have cars with spans that never contain \\(x = 0\\) at any turn, so they are always safe.\n  - Freeway 7 has a car that causes collision at relative turns \\(\\tau = 4\\) and \\(\\tau = 5\\) (absolute turns 37 and 38).\n  - Freeway 8 has a car that causes collision at relative turns \\(\\tau = 4\\) and \\(\\tau = 5\\) (absolute turns 37 and 38).\n- At other times, freeways 7 and 8 are safe.\n- The player must move from \\(y = 7\\) to \\(y = 9\\). Since each action changes \\(y\\) by at most \\(\\pm 1\\), the minimum number of actions required is 2 (e.g., two \"U\" actions to move up twice).\n- At \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 33), \\(y = 7\\) is safe (no collision on freeway 7).\n- At \\(\\tau = 1\\) (turn 34), \\(y = 8\\) is safe (no collision on freeway 8).\n- Moving up to \\(y = 9\\) at \\(\\tau = 2\\) (turn 35) is safe, as \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway and has no cars.\n\n### Minimal Sequence\n- With \\(H = 2\\) actions, the sequence is:\n  - At turn 33 (\\(t_1\\)): action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 8\\)).\n  - At turn 34 (\\(t_1 + 1\\)): action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 9\\)).\n- This reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 35 (\\(t_1 + 2\\)) with no collisions.\n\nNo alternative sequence with fewer turns is possible, as \\(H = 1\\) would require moving directly from \\(y = 7\\) to \\(y = 9\\), which is not allowed (actions only change \\(y\\) by \\(\\pm 1\\) or 0). Delaying actions would increase \\(H\\), so \\(H = 2\\) is minimal.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 33: U \\\\\nTurn 34: U\n}",
