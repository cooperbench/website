The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway at a certain turn, I'm not in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. All cars are right-moving, according to the table. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)], where t1 is the current turn, which is 0.\n\nLet me denote the current time as t = 0 for simplicity, since t1 is given as 0.\n\nSo for each freeway k, I have the car details:\n\n- Freeway 1: head h=48, tail τ=37, direction right, speed s=12. Since direction is right, the span at time T is [τ + sT, h + sT] because T - t1 = T - 0 = T.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut τ and h: for right-moving, the head is at the right end, so as time increases, both head and tail increase.\n\nIn the span notation, it says for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd since the car is defined with head and tail, for right-moving, head should be larger than tail, I assume.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: head=48, tail=37, so head > tail, which makes sense for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, others: freeway 2: head=-48? Tail=-59. Head=-48, tail=-59, since -48 > -59, yes head > tail.\n\nFreeway 6: head=-48, tail=-83, -48 > -83.\n\nFreeway 7: head=-48, tail=-95.\n\nAll seem consistent.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T, where y_T is the row I'm on at turn T.\n\nImportant note: when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose an action to go to y_{T+1}. But at the moment of turn T, I am on y_T, so I check for collision on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nIf I move to a different row, I'm not on that row until the next turn.\n\nAlso, y_{T+1} is set after the action, so at turn T, position is (0, y_T), and after action, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, and I move to that position for the next turn.\n\nBut for collision, it's based on where I am at the start of the turn, I think.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn T, I am at (0, y_T), and I might take an action to move to a different y, but during turn T, I am on row y_T, so if there is a car on that row at time T that has 0 in its span, I collide.\n\nThen, after taking the action, I move to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThat makes sense. So only the row I'm currently on matters at each turn.\n\nNow, I start at (0,0) at turn 0.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0, there are no cars, so no collision possible. Similarly, y=9 is the goal, and probably no cars there, but I need to reach (0,9), and once I'm there, I stop, I assume.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, and since it's not a freeway, no cars, so no issue.\n\nBut I need to be at (0,9) at some turn, say turn H-1.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, and y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSince t1=0, we need y_{H-1} =9.\n\nActions from turn 0 to turn H-1, and after H-1 actions, we are at y=9.\n\nNow, each action changes y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nWe start at y=0, want to go to y=9, so we need to increase y by 9, so minimum turns if no cars would be 9 turns, all up actions.\n\nBut there are cars on the way, so I might need to wait or go down sometimes to avoid them.\n\nThe minimal H could be more than 9 if I have to detour.\n\nBut since I can only move one step at a time, and I need to go up 9, but I might go down and up, so H could be larger.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so I should try to go up as much as possible, only waiting or detouring when necessary.\n\nBut with waiting, I might increase H, but if I can avoid by moving vertically, but vertical movement is only between rows, not within, so I have to be on a row at each turn.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when cars are present at x=0.\n\nSince the cars are moving, and x=0 is the point we care about.\n\nFor each freeway k, and time T, there is a car if 0 is in the span of the car on that freeway at time T.\n\nSince each freeway has only one car, I think, from the table.\n\nThe table has one row per freeway, so one car per freeway.\n\nFor freeway k, car span at time T is [τ_k + s_k T, h_k + s_k T] for right-moving, and we need to see if 0 is in that interval.\n\nThat is, if τ_k + s_k T ≤ 0 ≤ h_k + s_k T.\n\nSince the car is right-moving, head is larger, so the span is [left end, right end] with left end = τ + sT, right end = h + sT.\n\nFor 0 to be in [left, right], we need left ≤ 0 ≤ right.\n\nNow, for each k, I can find the times T when this is true.\n\nThen, for me to be on row k at time T, I must not have collision, meaning that for that k and T, 0 should not be in the car span.\n\nIf 0 is in the span, I collide if I'm there.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on row k when 0 is in the car span for that k.\n\nNow, let's list the car parameters for each freeway.\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so:\n\nFreeway 1: τ=37, h=48, s=12\n\nSpan at T: [37 + 12T, 48 + 12T]\n\n0 in span: 37 + 12T ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 12T\n\nSince 37 + 12T ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 48 + 12T\n\nBut 48 + 12T is always positive for T≥0, so 0 ≤ 48 + 12T always true.\n\nThen 37 + 12T ≤ 0 ⇒ 12T ≤ -37 ⇒ T ≤ -37/12 ≈ -3.083, but T is time, starts from 0, so for T≥0, 37 + 12T ≥ 37 >0, so left end >0, so 0 < left end, not ≤, so 0 not in span for any T≥0.\n\nSimilarly, right end 48 + 12T >0 always, but since left end >0, 0 is not in [left, right] for T≥0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, no car at x=0 for any T≥0. Good, so I can be on row 1 anytime without collision.\n\nIs that right?\n\nτ=37, s=12, at T=0, span [37,48], all positive, so x=0 not in.\n\nAs T increases, span moves right, so always to the right of 0, so indeed, for freeway 1, no issue.\n\nNow freeway 2: head=-48, tail=-59, s=6, direction right.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + sT, h + sT] = [-59 + 6T, -48 + 6T]\n\n0 in span: -59 + 6T ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 6T\n\nWhich is -59 + 6T ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 6T\n\nFirst: -59 + 6T ≤ 0 ⇒ 6T ≤ 59 ⇒ T ≤ 59/6 ≈ 9.833\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 6T ⇒ 48 ≤ 6T ⇒ T ≥ 48/6 = 8\n\nSo for T from 8 to 9.833, since T integer, T=8 and T=9.\n\nAt T=8: left = -59 + 48 = -11? -59 + 6*8 = -59 + 48 = -11\n\nRight = -48 + 48 = 0\n\nSo span [-11, 0], so 0 is included, since right end is 0.\n\nThe inequality is ≤, so at right end=0, 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9: left = -59 + 54 = -5? 6*9=54, -59+54=-5\n\nRight = -48 + 54 = 6\n\nSpan [-5,6], 0 is in it.\n\nT=10: left = -59 + 60 =1, right= -48+60=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nT=7: left = -59 +42= -17, right= -48+42= -6, span [-17,-6], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 2, collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Head=-48, tail=-59, s=6, right.\n\nTable says: | 3 | (-48, -59, right, 6) |\n\nSame as freeway 2. So same, collision at T=8,9.\n\nFreeway 4: also (-48, -59, right, 6), same.\n\nFreeway 5: also (-48, -59, right, 6), same.\n\nSo freeways 2,3,4,5 all have the same car? Or different cars but same parameters? But since each freeway has its own car, but parameters identical, so for each, collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway 6: head=-48, tail=-83, s=36, right.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + sT, h + sT] = [-83 + 36T, -48 + 36T]\n\n0 in span: -83 + 36T ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 36T\n\nFirst: -83 + 36T ≤ 0 ⇒ 36T ≤ 83 ⇒ T ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so T≤2 since integer.\n\nT≤2.305, so T=0,1,2\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 36T ⇒ 48 ≤ 36T ⇒ T ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so T≥2 since integer? T≥2.\n\nT≥1.333, so for integer T, T≥2.\n\nT≥2 and T≤2, so T=2.\n\nNow check:\n\nT=2: left = -83 + 72 = -11? 36*2=72, -83+72= -11\n\nRight= -48 + 72 = 24\n\nSpan [-11,24], 0 in it.\n\nT=1: left = -83 + 36 = -47, right= -48+36= -12, span [-47,-12], 0 not in.\n\nT=0: left = -83, right= -48, span [-83,-48], 0 not in.\n\nT=3: left = -83 + 108=25, right= -48+108=60, span [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=2, collision for freeway 6.\n\nNow freeway 7: head=-48, tail=-95, s=48, right.\n\nSpan at T: [-95 + 48T, -48 + 48T]\n\n0 in span: -95 + 48T ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 48T\n\nFirst: -95 + 48T ≤ 0 ⇒ 48T ≤ 95 ⇒ T ≤ 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so T≤1\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 48T ⇒ 48T ≥ 48 ⇒ T ≥ 1\n\nSo T≥1 and T≤1, so T=1.\n\nCheck:\n\nT=1: left = -95 + 48 = -47, right= -48 + 48 = 0, span [-47,0], 0 included.\n\nT=0: left=-95, right=-48, span [-95,-48], 0 not in.\n\nT=2: left = -95 + 96 =1, right= -48+96=48, span [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo only T=1.\n\nNow freeway 8: head=-48, tail=-95, s=48, right. Same as freeway 7.\n\n| 8 | (-48, -95, right, 48) | yes same.\n\nSo collision at T=1.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the dangerous times when I cannot be on that row:\n\n- Freeway 1: never dangerous (no car at x=0)\n\n- Freeway 2: dangerous at T=8,9\n\n- Freeway 3: dangerous at T=8,9\n\n- Freeway 4: dangerous at T=8,9\n\n- Freeway 5: dangerous at T=8,9\n\n- Freeway 6: dangerous at T=2\n\n- Freeway 7: dangerous at T=1\n\n- Freeway 8: dangerous at T=1\n\nFreeway 1 is safe at all times.\n\nI start at y=0 at T=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so safe.\n\nThe path: I need to go from row 0 to row 9, moving one row per turn or staying, but since I want to minimize turns, I should move up as much as possible, only stay or move down to avoid being on a dangerous row at dangerous time.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0, so to go from 0 to 9, minimum 9 up moves, but I might have down or stay, which increase H.\n\nH is the number of turns including the start, but let's see.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nAfter H turns, from T=0 to T=H-1, I have taken H actions, and y_{H-1} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to t=H-1.\n\ny_0 =0.\n\nAfter action a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{H-2}, y_{H-1} = y_{H-2} + Δy_{H-2}\n\nAnd we set y_{H-1} =9.\n\nSince we start at T=0, y=0, and after H-1 actions, at turn H-1, y=9.\n\nThe time when I am on a row is at each turn T.\n\nI need for each T, when I am on y_T, it should not be dangerous for that y_T and T.\n\ny_T is the row I am on at turn T.\n\nSince y must be between 0 and 9, and I start at 0, end at 9, and I can only change by ±1 or 0, the net change must be +9, so the number of up moves minus down moves must be 9, and let S be number of stay moves, then the total number of turns H satisfies y_{H-1} - y_0 = sum of Δy from t=0 to H-2? Let's think carefully.\n\ny_0 =0\n\nAfter action a_t at turn t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, I move to y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nThe last turn is turn H-1, at which I am at y_{H-1} =9.\n\nI have taken actions from t=0 to t=H-1? No.\n\nThe actions: from t=0 to H-1, that's H actions.\n\nAfter each action, I move to the next position.\n\nAt turn 0: position y_0\n\nAfter action a_0, position y_1 for turn 1\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{H-2}, position y_{H-1} for turn H-1\n\nThen, after action a_{H-1}, position y_H for turn H, but we don't care about turn H, since we only need to be at y=9 at turn H-1.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\", which is turn H-1 for us.\n\nAnd \"sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\"\n\nSo actions from t=0 to H-1, but at turn t, after action, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nLet's clarify the indexing.\n\nSet t1=0 for simplicity.\n\nAt turn 0: position (0, y_0) = (0,0)\n\nI take action a_0, then y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\nAt turn 1: position (0, y_1)\n\nI take action a_1, y_2 = y_1 + Δy_1\n\n...\n\nAt turn T: position (0, y_T)\n\nI take action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T\n\nThen at turn T+1: position (0, y_{T+1})\n\nWe need at some turn K, y_K =9, and K = t1 + H -1 = H-1.\n\nSo at turn H-1, y_{H-1} =9.\n\nActions are taken from t=0 to t=H-1, but action a_t is taken at turn t, affecting y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision, at each turn T, we are at y_T, and we check collision on freeway y_T at time T.\n\ny_T is the row at time T.\n\nNow, to have y_{H-1} =9, starting from y_0=0.\n\nThe net displacement: y_{H-1} - y_0 = sum_{t=0}^{H-2} Δy_t + something, let's see.\n\ny_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\ny_2 = y_1 + Δy_1 = y_0 + Δy_0 + Δy_1\n\n...\n\ny_{H-1} = y_0 + sum_{t=0}^{H-2} Δy_t\n\nSince y_{H-1} = y_0 + Δy_0 + Δy_1 + ... + Δy_{H-2}\n\nΔy_t is the change due to action at turn t, to get to turn t+1.\n\nFrom turn 0 to turn H-1, there are H-1 actions? No.\n\nFrom turn 0 to turn 1, action a_0\n\nFrom turn 1 to turn 2, action a_1\n\n...\n\nFrom turn H-2 to turn H-1, action a_{H-2}\n\nThen at turn H-1, we are at y_{H-1}, and we need y_{H-1}=9.\n\nWe also take an action at turn H-1, but since we are already at y=9, the action might not matter, but we need to specify the action, I think, but since we reach at turn H-1, and we take action a_{H-1}, which would set y_H, but we don't care, as long as at turn H-1 we are at 9.\n\nThe action sequence is given from t=0 to H-1, including a_{H-1}.\n\nBut for reaching, a_{H-1} can be anything, since we are already at 9.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 0, we start at y_0, take action a_0 to go to y_1.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, we are at y_T, before taking action.\n\nNow, back to the problem.\n\nI need to find a sequence of y_T for T=0,1,2,... with y_0=0, y_{H-1}=9, and for each T, y_T is between 0 and 9, and for each T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, it must not be a dangerous time for that freeway.\n\nThat is, for each T and k, if y_T = k, then T not in dangerous times for k.\n\nNow, dangerous times:\n\n- For k=1: no dangerous times, always safe\n\n- k=2: dangerous at T=8,9\n\n- k=3: dangerous at T=8,9\n\n- k=4: dangerous at T=8,9\n\n- k=5: dangerous at T=8,9\n\n- k=6: dangerous at T=2\n\n- k=7: dangerous at T=1\n\n- k=8: dangerous at T=1\n\nAlso, k=1 always safe.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9 in H-1 steps? Turns from 0 to H-1, that's H positions, but the number of actions is H.\n\nLet N be the turn when I reach y=9, so at turn N, y_N=9.\n\nThen N = H-1, so H = N+1.\n\nBut we need to find H and actions.\n\nSince y changes slowly, I can think of the path over time.\n\nI start at T=0, y=0.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some T=N.\n\nThe minimal N is 9, if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I have to avoid the dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nFirst, at T=0, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nNow, dangerous times are T=1,2,8,9 for certain rows.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At T=1, rows 7 and 8 are dangerous, so I should not be on row 7 or 8 at T=1.\n\n- At T=2, row 6 is dangerous, so not on row 6 at T=2.\n\n- At T=8, rows 2,3,4,5 dangerous.\n\n- At T=9, rows 2,3,4,5 dangerous.\n\nOther times, all rows are safe, since k=1 always safe, and others only dangerous at specific times.\n\nFor example, row 2 is only dangerous at T=8,9, so at other times, I can be on row 2 safely.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, since I want to minimize H, which corresponds to N, the turn when I reach y=9, with y_N=9.\n\nMinimal N is 9, if possible.\n\nCan I reach y=9 by T=9?\n\nThat means in 9 turns, from T=0 to T=9, but at T=0 y=0, at T=9 y=9, so I need exactly 9 up moves, no down or stay, so y_T = T for T from 0 to 9.\n\ny_0=0, y_1=1, y_2=2, ..., y_9=9.\n\nNow, check for each T, if on a freeway, is it dangerous.\n\nAt T=0: y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nT=1: y=1, freeway 1, which is always safe, so ok.\n\nT=2: y=2, freeway 2, but at T=2, is it dangerous? Freeway 2 dangerous only at T=8,9, not at T=2. So should be safe.\n\nBut let's confirm: freeway 2 dangerous at T=8,9 only.\n\nSimilarly, T=3: y=3, freeway 3, dangerous only at T=8,9, so at T=3 safe.\n\nT=4: y=4, freeway 4, safe at T=4.\n\nT=5: y=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\nT=6: y=6, freeway 6, dangerous at T=2, but T=6, so should be safe? Freeway 6 dangerous only at T=2.\n\nAt T=6, not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly T=7: y=7, freeway 7, dangerous at T=1, not T=7, safe.\n\nT=8: y=8, freeway 8, dangerous at T=1, not T=8, freeway 8 dangerous at T=1 only.\n\nT=9: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nBut at T=8, y=8, freeway 8 is not dangerous at T=8? Freeway 8 dangerous only at T=1, so at T=8 safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, y=9 safe.\n\nBut earlier for rows 2-5, dangerous at T=8,9.\n\nAt T=8, if I am on y=8, which is freeway 8, but freeway 8 is not dangerous at T=8, only at T=1.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5 are dangerous at T=8,9.\n\nBut at T=8, in the direct path, I am on y=8, which is freeway 8, not on freeway 2-5.\n\nSimilarly at T=9, on y=9.\n\nSo in this path, at no point am I on a dangerous row at dangerous time.\n\nAt T=1, y=1, freeway 1, safe.\n\nT=2, y=2, freeway 2, not dangerous at T=2.\n\nOnly dangerous if at T=8 on y=2,3,4,5 or at T=9 on same, but I'm not.\n\nSimilarly, at T=1, if on y=7 or 8, dangerous, but I'm on y=1.\n\nSo in this case, with y_T = T for T=0 to 9, I reach at T=9, with no collision.\n\nIs that right?\n\nBut at T=2, y=2, freeway 2: dangerous times T=8,9, so at T=2, not dangerous, yes.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut what about freeway 6? At T=2, if I were on y=6, it would be dangerous, but in this path, at T=2, I am on y=2, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly, at T=1, if on y=7 or 8, dangerous, but I am on y=1.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, I can go directly up in 9 moves: from T=0 to T=9, y from 0 to 9, each step up.\n\nThen at turn H-1 =9, y=9.\n\nH-1=9, so H=10.\n\nTurns: from turn 0 to turn 9, that's 10 turns, but positions at 10 times.\n\ny_0=0 at T=0\n\nAfter 9 up actions: after action a_0, y_1=1 at T=1\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_8, y_9=9 at T=9\n\nThen I need to take action a_9 at T=9, but since I am already at y=9, a_9 can be S, for example.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from t=0 to H-1.\n\nH is such that at turn H-1, y=9.\n\nHere, at turn 9, y=9, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=9.\n\nAt each turn t, I take action a_t.\n\nFor t=0 to 8, I take U to go from y_t to y_{t+1} = y_t +1.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt turn 0: take U, go to y=1\n\nAt turn 1: at y=1, take U, go to y=2\n\n...\n\nAt turn 8: at y=8, take U, go to y=9\n\nThen at turn 9: at y=9, I need to take an action, say S, to stay, but since I'm already at 9, and no collision possible.\n\nNow, check if at any point I was on a dangerous row at wrong time.\n\nFor example, at turn 1: y=1, freeway 1, always safe.\n\nTurn 2: y=2, freeway 2, dangerous only at T=8,9, so safe.\n\nTurn 3: y=3, freeway 3, safe since T=3≠8,9\n\nSimilarly turn 4: y=4, safe\n\nTurn 5: y=5, safe\n\nTurn 6: y=6, freeway 6, dangerous only at T=2, T=6≠2, safe.\n\nTurn 7: y=7, freeway 7, dangerous only at T=1, T=7≠1, safe.\n\nTurn 8: y=8, freeway 8, dangerous only at T=1, T=8≠1, safe.\n\nTurn 9: y=9, safe.\n\nAnd turn 0: y=0, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut is there a problem at T=1 or T=2?\n\nNo, as above.\n\nBut earlier I thought freeway 6 dangerous at T=2, but at T=2, I am not on y=6, I am on y=2.\n\nSimilarly, at T=1, not on y=7 or 8.\n\nSo yes, this path is safe.\n\nTherefore minimal H is 10, with 9 up moves and one stay or whatever at the end.\n\nBut H=10 turns, from turn 0 to turn 9, actions from t=0 to t=9.\n\nActions: t=0 to t=8: U, t=9: S or U or D, but since y=9, if I go U, y=10, but y must be <=9, so I cannot go up, must stay or down, but down to 8, but I need to be at 9 at turn H-1, which is turn 9, so at turn 9, I must be at y=9, so if I take action at turn 9, it sets y_{10}, but we don't care about turn 10.\n\nAt turn 9, I am at y_9=9, and I take action a_9, which can be S, to stay at 9, or if I go down, I go to 8, but then at turn 10, I would be at 8, not 9, but since we only need to be at 9 at turn 9, it's fine, but I should not go down because I might go below, but in this case, since we are at turn 9, and we need y_9=9, after taking a_9, y_{10} is set, but we don't require y_{10} to be anything, so I can take any action, but to be safe, I can take S.\n\nSimilarly, at start, at turn 0, I take action to go to y=1.\n\nIn the action sequence, for the last action, since I am at y=9, I can take S.\n\nNow, is there a shorter path? H=10, but minimal possible is 9 turns? If I can reach at turn 8.\n\nBut to reach at turn 8, y_8=9.\n\nFrom y_0=0 to y_8=9, I need net +9 in 8 steps? From turn 0 to turn 8, that's 8 actions to go to positions from y1 to y8.\n\ny_0 =0\n\nAfter 8 actions, y_8 = y_0 + sum_{t=0}^{7} Δy_t\n\nSet y_8=9.\n\nSince Δy_t = +1, -1, or 0, the sum must be 9.\n\nWith 8 actions, the maximum sum is 8, if all U, but 8<9, impossible to reach y=9 in 8 actions starting from y=0.\n\ny_8 = y_0 + Δy_0 + Δy_1 + ... + Δy_7\n\ny_0=0, y_8=9, so Δy_0 to Δy_7 sum to 9.\n\nBut each Δy <=1, so with 8 terms, maximum sum is 8, cannot be 9. So impossible to reach y=9 before turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 9 is the earliest possible.\n\nAnd we have a path to reach at turn 9 with no issues.\n\nBut let me double-check the dangerous times.\n\nFor example, at turn 1: if I were on row 7 or 8, dangerous, but I am on row 1.\n\nAt turn 2: if on row 6, dangerous, but I am on row 2.\n\nAt turn 8: if on row 2,3,4,5 dangerous, but I am on row 8.\n\nAt turn 9: if on row 2,3,4,5 dangerous, but I am on row 9.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 10, with actions: for turn 0 to 8: U, turn 9: S.\n\nBut turn 9 action can be S.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to output actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, but t_1=0, so from turn 0 to turn 9.\n\nActions: a_0 to a_9.\n\na_0: U to go from 0 to 1\n\na_1: U to go from 1 to 2\n\n...\n\na_8: U to go from 8 to 9\n\na_9: S to stay at 9\n\nNow, in the output format.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and H=10.\n\nBut is there a reason to have H smaller? No, since 9 is impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier by going faster, but I can only move one step per turn, so no.\n\nAnother thing: at T=1 and T=2, I might be forced to be on dangerous rows if I were higher, but in this case, I start low.\n\nSuppose I try to go down at some point, but that would only delay, so H larger, not smaller.\n\nSo minimal H is 10.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions again.\n\nFor example, freeway 6 at T=2: dangerous.\n\nIn the path, at T=2, I am on y=2, not 6.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nBut the answer should be in a box.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,0), and we need to reach (0,9).\n\nIn the action, at turn t, we take action a_t.\n\nSo for minimal H=10.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nBut at turn 9, after S, I stay at 9, but I am already at 9 at the start of turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, I am at y=9, I take S, stay at 9.\n\nI could take no action, but I have to take an action.\n\nIn the sequence, it must include up to a_{H-1}, with H=10, so a_9.\n\nNow, but in the output, it should be for turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, which is turn 0 to 9.\n\nBut let me see if at turn 1, is there any issue?\n\nAnother thing: freeway 7 and 8 dangerous at T=1.\n\nAt T=1, if I am on y=7 or 8, collision.\n\nBut in my path, at T=1, y=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster by being at higher y earlier, but I can't, since I start at 0 and move one step per turn.\n\nUnless I start moving before, but no.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars\", and in this case, no collision.\n\nBut let me check freeway 1: no car at x=0, so always safe.\n\nOthers only at specific times.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if multiple cars, but each freeway has one car.\n\nSo I think H=10 is achievable and minimal.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 6, at T=2, dangerous, but I am not there.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps at T=8, if I were on y=2, but I am not.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: S\n\n}\n\nBut turn 9 action is S, but I could put U, but y=9, if I go U, y=10, but y must be in 0-9, so invalid, I cannot go U, must go S or D.\n\nIf I go D, to y=8, but at turn 10, I would be at 8, not 9, but since we only care about turn 9, it might be acceptable, but better to stay.\n\nThe position must be within [0,9], so y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so at turn 9, if y_9=9, and I take U, y_{10}=10, which is invalid, not allowed. So I must take S or D.\n\nIf I take D, y_{10}=8, which is fine, but unnecessary, so S is better.\n\nSimilarly, at other points, but here only at end.\n\nSo S is fine.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, for turn 0 to 8, U, turn 9 S.\n\nBut is there a way with H=9? No, as I thought earlier.\n\ny_{H-1} =9, with H-1 minimal.\n\nMinimal H-1=9, as above.\n\nIf I could reach at turn 8, y_8=9, but from y_0=0, with 8 actions? y_8 = sum of Δy from t=0 to 7, max 8, less than 9, impossible.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, this should be the answer.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) is 10, with the sequence of actions achieving this in \\(H = 10\\) turns.\n\nThe car collision constraints are as follows, based on the car states and their movement:\n- Freeway 1: Always safe (no collision at x=0 for any turn).\n- Freeway 2: Dangerous at turns 8 and 9.\n- Freeway 3: Dangerous at turns 8 and 9.\n- Freeway 4: Dangerous at turns 8 and 9.\n- Freeway 5: Dangerous at turns 8 and 9.\n- Freeway 6: Dangerous at turn 2.\n- Freeway 7: Dangerous at turn 1.\n- Freeway 8: Dangerous at turn 1.\n\nThe sequence of actions moves the player directly upward from row 0 to row 9 in 9 steps, reaching row 9 at turn 9, with no collisions:\n- At turn 0, starting at row 0, action \\(U\\) moves to row 1 at turn 1.\n- At turn 1, on row 1 (freeway 1, safe), action \\(U\\) moves to row 2 at turn 2.\n- At turn 2, on row 2 (freeway 2, safe since turn 2 is not dangerous for freeway 2), action \\(U\\) moves to row 3 at turn 3.\n- At turn 3, on row 3 (freeway 3, safe), action \\(U\\) moves to row 4 at turn 4.\n- At turn 4, on row 4 (freeway 4, safe), action \\(U\\) moves to row 5 at turn 5.\n- At turn 5, on row 5 (freeway 5, safe), action \\(U\\) moves to row 6 at turn 6.\n- At turn 6, on row 6 (freeway 6, safe since turn 6 is not dangerous for freeway 6), action \\(U\\) moves to row 7 at turn 7.\n- At turn 7, on row 7 (freeway 7, safe since turn 7 is not dangerous for freeway 7), action \\(U\\) moves to row 8 at turn 8.\n- At turn 8, on row 8 (freeway 8, safe since turn 8 is not dangerous for freeway 8), action \\(U\\) moves to row 9 at turn 9.\n- At turn 9, on row 9 (goal, safe), action \\(S\\) is taken to stay, as moving up would exceed the grid boundary (y=9 is maximum).\n\nThis path avoids all dangerous row-turn combinations:\n- At turn 1, on row 1 (safe), avoiding rows 7 and 8 which are dangerous at turn 1.\n- At turn 2, on row 2 (safe), avoiding row 6 which is dangerous at turn 2.\n- At turns 8 and 9, on rows 8 and 9 (safe), avoiding rows 2–5 which are dangerous at turns 8 and 9.\n\nReaching row 9 by turn 9 (i.e., \\(H-1 = 9\\)) is minimal because reaching it earlier (e.g., turn 8) is impossible: starting from row 0, at most 8 rows can be gained in 8 actions (since each action changes y by at most +1), but 8 < 9.\n\nThus, the minimal \\(H\\) is 10, with the action sequence:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U \\\\\nTurn 1: U \\\\\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t_1 = 1, and the player is at (0,1). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to y=8). The player moves vertically: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same). The player can only be on one row at a time.\n\nImportant note: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at turn T. However, note that when the player moves from row y to row y' at turn T, at turn T they are still on row y. Then at turn T+1, they will be on row y'. Therefore, they are only at risk of collision on row y at turn T and on row y' at turn T+1.\n\nWe are starting at (0,1) at turn t_1=1. We have to avoid collisions on rows 1 to 8.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t_1=1 (current turn). For each freeway k (which corresponds to row k) we have a car defined by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note:\n\n- For left-moving cars: the car moves to the left. The span at time t_1 is [h, τ] (with h > τ because it's left-moving? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\". So if h is the head and τ the tail, and the car is moving left, then the head is on the right? Actually, the problem states: \n   - Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] meaning from h to τ? But note that for left-moving, the head is at h and tail at τ, and then the car moves left so the entire segment moves left.\n\nBut observe the given cars: all are right-moving? Because the direction is \"right\" for all. So let's focus on right-moving.\n\nFor right-moving:\n   Span(t1) = [τ, h]  -> becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nWait, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" meaning from τ to h? and then at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut in the given table for freeway 1: (60,49,right,12) -> but 60>49, so if it's [τ, h] then τ=49 and h=60? That would be [49,60] at t1=1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-42,-53,right,6) -> if we take τ=-53 and h=-42? then the span at t1 is [-53, -42]. Then at time T, it becomes [-53 + 6*(T-1), -42 + 6*(T-1)].\n\nBut note: the collision condition is that the player is at (0, k) at turn T and the car on freeway k has a span that includes 0 at turn T.\n\nSo for a right-moving car on freeway k at time T, we require that 0 is in [τ + s*(T-1), h + s*(T-1)]? Actually, note the update: at turn T (relative to t1=1), the time elapsed is (T - t1) = T-1.\n\nTherefore, for a car on freeway k at turn T, we check if 0 is in the interval [τ + s*(T-1), h + s*(T-1)] for a right-moving car? But wait, the problem says for right-moving: \n   Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the given representation for right-moving is: at t1, the car is [τ, h]. So if τ is the tail and h is the head? Then the car covers from τ to h. So for freeway 1: [49,60] at t1=1.\n\nBut then at time T, the car is at [49 + 12*(T-1), 60 + 12*(T-1)].\n\nWe must check if 0 is in that interval? But 49+12*(T-1) is increasing and already at T=1: 49 to 60, which is positive and above 0? So 0 is not in [49,60]. Similarly, as time increases, the car moves to the right so it will never cover 0? Then freeway 1 is safe.\n\nBut wait, freeway 7 and 8: \n   Freeway 7: (0,-47,right,48) -> so at t1=1, the car is [τ, h] = [-47, 0]? But the representation in the table is (head, tail) = (0,-47) and direction right. \n\nThe problem says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor a right-moving car, the head is at the front? So if the car is moving right, the head is the rightmost point? Then at t1, the car is from τ to h? So for freeway 7: head=0, tail=-47, so the span is [-47,0] at t1=1.\n\nThen at time T, the car is at [-47 + 48*(T-1), 0 + 48*(T-1)].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as 7: (0,-47,right,48) -> same.\n\nSo at T=1, freeway 7: [-47,0]. Then 0 is in [-47,0]? Yes, so at turn 1, if the player is on freeway 7, they would collide? But we are starting at (0,1) at turn 1, so we are on row 1, not row 7.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions on every freeway we are on at every turn.\n\nWe start at turn 1 at row 1. Let's check row 1 at turn 1: \n   Freeway 1: car is [49,60] at T=1 -> 0 is not in [49,60] -> safe.\n\nNow, what about row 1 at future turns? \n   At time T, the car on row 1 is [49+12*(T-1), 60+12*(T-1)]. Since 49+12*(T-1) >=49>0, so 0 is never in the interval? So row 1 is always safe.\n\nRow 2: car is (-42,-53,right,6) -> so head=-42, tail=-53? Then the span at T=1: [-53,-42]. Then at time T: [-53+6*(T-1), -42+6*(T-1)].\n\nWe need to check if 0 is in that interval? \n   -53+6*(T-1) <= 0 <= -42+6*(T-1)\n\nBut note: -53+6*(T-1) is increasing. Let's solve:\n   -53+6*(T-1) <= 0 <= -42+6*(T-1)\n\nFirst inequality: -53+6*(T-1) <=0 -> 6*(T-1) <=53 -> T-1 <= 53/6 ≈8.83 -> T<=9.83 -> T<=9 (since T integer)\nSecond inequality: 0<= -42+6*(T-1) -> 42<=6*(T-1) -> T-1>=7 -> T>=8.\n\nSo for T from 8 to 9 (inclusive) the car on row 2 covers 0? \n   T=8: [-53+6*7, -42+6*7] = [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in the interval? Actually, the interval is [-11,0]. Since 0 is the endpoint? The problem says \"if 0 in Span(T)\". So 0 is included? Then at T=8 and T=9, row 2 is dangerous.\n\nBut wait T=8: [ -53+6*(8-1)= -53+42 = -11, -42+42=0 ] -> so [ -11, 0 ] -> 0 is included? Yes.\nT=9: [ -53+6*8 = -53+48=-5, -42+48=6 ] -> [ -5, 6] -> 0 is included.\n\nT=10: [ -53+6*9 = -53+54=1, -42+54=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\nSo row 2 is dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut note: we are at turn 1. We are currently on row 1. We need to go to row 9. We can move up, down, or stay.\n\nWe must avoid being on row 2 at turn 8 or 9? Actually, at any turn we are on row 2, we must avoid that the car on row 2 has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nSimilarly, we must check all rows.\n\nWe'll check each freeway (row) for the time intervals when the car on that row covers 0.\n\nRow 1: car (60,49,right,12) -> [49+12*(T-1), 60+12*(T-1)].\n   Minimum: 49+0=49>0, so never covers 0? -> always safe.\n\nRow 2: car (-42,-53,right,6) -> head=-42, tail=-53 -> at T: [ -53+6*(T-1), -42+6*(T-1) ]\n   We found T=8 and T=9: dangerous.\n\nRow 3: same as row 2: (-42,-53,right,6) -> same as row 2: dangerous at T=8,9.\n\nRow 4: same -> dangerous at T=8,9.\n\nRow 5: same -> dangerous at T=8,9.\n\nRow 6: (-12,-47,right,36) -> head=-12, tail=-47 -> at T: [ -47+36*(T-1), -12+36*(T-1) ]\n\nCheck when 0 is in [ -47+36*(T-1), -12+36*(T-1) ]\n\n   Lower bound <=0: -47+36*(T-1) <=0 -> 36*(T-1)<=47 -> T-1<=47/36≈1.305 -> T<=2.305 -> T=1,2\n   Upper bound>=0: -12+36*(T-1)>=0 -> 36*(T-1)>=12 -> T-1>=12/36=1/3 -> T>=1.33 -> so T>=2.\n\nSo T=2: \n   T=1: [ -47, -12] -> 0 not in (both negative)\n   T=2: [ -47+36, -12+36] = [-11, 24] -> 0 is in [-11,24]? Yes, because -11<=0<=24.\n\nSo row 6 is dangerous at T=2.\n\nRow 7: (0,-47,right,48) -> head=0, tail=-47 -> at T: [ -47+48*(T-1), 0+48*(T-1) ]\n\n   At T=1: [ -47, 0] -> 0 is included? So row 7 is dangerous at T=1? But we are at T=1 and we are on row 1, not row 7. So if we are on row 7 at T=1, we collide. But we aren't.\n\n   When is it dangerous? We require 0 in [ -47+48*(T-1), 48*(T-1) ]\n\n   Lower bound <=0: -47+48*(T-1)<=0 -> 48*(T-1)<=47 -> T-1<=47/48<1 -> T<=1. something -> T=1 only? \n   At T=1: [ -47,0] -> includes 0? yes.\n   At T=2: [ -47+48, 48] = [1,48] -> 0 not included.\n\n   So row 7 is dangerous only at T=1.\n\nRow 8: same as row 7: dangerous at T=1.\n\nBut note: we are at T=1 and we are on row 1, so row 7 and 8 are dangerous at T=1 but we are not there.\n\nNow, what about future turns? \n   For row 7: after T=1, the car moves right and never comes back? Because the speed is positive and the car is moving right. Similarly for row 8.\n\nBut wait, what if the car wraps around? The problem does not mention wrapping. The grid is infinite? Actually, the problem doesn't specify, but the cars are defined with integer positions and they move linearly. Since we are only concerned about the car covering 0, and the car moves away from 0 (for row 7 and 8: after T=1, the car is at positive positions and increasing) so they will never cover 0 again.\n\nTherefore, the dangerous times:\n\nRow 1: never\nRow 2: T=8,9\nRow 3: T=8,9\nRow 4: T=8,9\nRow 5: T=8,9\nRow 6: T=2\nRow 7: T=1\nRow 8: T=1\n\nWe start at (0,1) at T=1. We are safe on row 1 at T=1.\n\nWe need to get to row 9. The minimal number of moves? Since we are at row 1 and we need to go to row 9, we need at least 8 moves (each U increases by 1). But we might have to wait because of the cars.\n\nWe can move up, down, or stay. But note: we can only be on rows 0 to 9. We start at 1 and want to go to 9, so we must go upward. But we might have to wait (stay) or even go down to avoid a collision and then come back? But that would cost more moves.\n\nWe are to minimize H (the number of turns). So we want to go as fast as possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid:\n\n- On row 6 at T=2: dangerous.\n- On rows 2,3,4,5 at T=8 or 9: dangerous.\n\nSince we start at T=1 at row 1, we can plan:\n\nOption 1: Move up as quickly as possible.\n\nT=1: at row1 -> safe.\nT=2: we can choose to move to row2? But row2 at T=2: we must check if row2 is dangerous at T=2? \n   For row2: we found dangerous only at T=8,9 -> so at T=2, row2 is safe? \n   But we have to compute the car on row2 at T=2: \n        [ -53+6*(2-1) = -53+6 = -47, -42+6=-36] -> [-47,-36] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSo we can move to row2 at T=2.\n\nThen T=3: from row2 we can go to row3? But check row3 at T=3: \n   Row3 car: same as row2: [ -53+6*(3-1)= -53+12=-41, -42+12=-30] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, row4 and row5 at T=4 and T=5: \n   Row4 at T=4: [ -53+6*3 = -53+18=-35, -42+18=-24] -> safe.\n   Row5 at T=5: [ -53+6*4=-53+24=-29, -42+24=-18] -> safe.\n\nBut then we come to row6: if we try to be at row6 at T=6? \n   Row6 at T=6: [ -47+36*(6-1)= -47+36*5= -47+180=133, -12+180=168] -> [133,168] -> safe? because 0 not in.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid being on row6 at T=2? But we are going to row6 at T=6, which is safe.\n\nSo if we go up every turn:\n\nT=1: row1\nT=2: row2 (action U at T=1: but note the action at turn t_1=1 will determine the next state at T=2)\n\nThe sequence:\n\nTurn 1: we are at row1. We take an action that will determine row at T=2.\n\nWe want to go to row2 at T=2: so we do U at turn1.\n\nThen at T=2: row2.\n\nThen at turn2: we do U -> T=3: row3.\nTurn3: U -> T=4: row4.\nTurn4: U -> T=5: row5.\nTurn5: U -> T=6: row6. -> but at T=6, row6 is safe? (we computed above: [133,168] -> safe)\nTurn6: U -> T=7: row7.\nTurn7: U -> T=8: row8.\nTurn8: U -> T=9: row9.\n\nBut wait: we have to check row7 and row8 at the times we are on them.\n\nRow7: we are on row7 at T=7. \n   The car on row7 at T=7: [ -47+48*(7-1) = -47+48*6 = -47+288=241, 0+48*6=288] -> [241,288] -> safe.\n\nRow8: at T=8: [ -47+48*7 = -47+336=289, 0+48*7=336] -> safe.\n\nBut what about row2,3,4,5 at T=8? We are not on them at T=8. We are on row8 at T=8.\n\nSo is this path safe?\n\nWe must check every row we are on at the time we are on it:\n\nT=1: row1 -> safe (as we know)\nT=2: row2 -> safe (computed: [-47,-36] -> no 0)\nT=3: row3 -> [ -53+6*(3-1)= -53+12=-41, -42+12=-30] -> safe\nT=4: row4 -> [ -53+6*3=-35, -42+18=-24] -> safe\nT=5: row5 -> [ -53+6*4=-29, -42+24=-18] -> safe\nT=6: row6 -> [ -47+36*5= -47+180=133, -12+180=168] -> safe\nT=7: row7 -> [ -47+48*6=241, 48*6=288] -> safe\nT=8: row8 -> [ -47+48*7=289, 48*7=336] -> safe\nT=9: row9 -> no car (since cars are on rows 1-8) -> safe.\n\nBut we are at row9 at T=9. That is the goal. So we reached in 8 moves? But note: we started at T=1 and we did 8 actions? \n\nThe actions: \n   Turn1: U -> leads to T=2: row2\n   Turn2: U -> T=3: row3\n   Turn3: U -> T=4: row4\n   Turn4: U -> T=5: row5\n   Turn5: U -> T=6: row6\n   Turn6: U -> T=7: row7\n   Turn7: U -> T=8: row8\n   Turn8: U -> T=9: row9\n\nSo we did 8 actions? Then H=8? But note: the problem says the sequence of actions for t_1 to t_1+H-1, and then at turn t_1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nHere, t_1=1, and we are at row9 at T=9, which is turn 9. And we did actions from turn1 to turn8. So the last action is at turn8 which leads to row9 at turn9. So H=9? \n\nWait, the time when we are at row9 is turn9. How many actions? We did 8 actions (from turn1 to turn8). But the minimal number of moves is the number of actions? The problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence of actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1. \n\nThe problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd note: at the start, we are at turn t_1 at (0, y_{t_1}). Then we take an action at turn t_1, then at turn t_1+1, we are at a new position, etc.\n\nSo we start at turn t_1. After H-1 actions, we have taken actions at turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-2, and then at turn t_1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nIn our plan:\n\nWe start at turn1 (t_1=1) at row1.\n\nAfter the first action (at turn1) we are at turn2 at row2.\n...\nAfter the 8th action (at turn8) we are at turn9 at row9.\n\nSo we have taken actions at turns 1,2,...,8 (8 actions) and we are at row9 at turn9. So H-1 = 8? Then H=9? \n\nBut note: the minimal number of moves required: we start at row1 and need to get to row9: 8 steps up. So we need at least 8 moves? Then H should be 9? Because we start at turn1 and end at turn9? \n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". What is H? It says \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1? \n\nActually, the sequence is indexed from t=0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions? Then the time at which we are at the goal is t_1 + H? \n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and we reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1? \n\nLet me re-read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd in the answer format: \n   Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n   Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\n   ... until turn t_1 + H - 1.\n\nSo the last action is at turn t_1 + H - 1, and then after that action, we are at (0,9) at the next turn? But the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"?\n\nActually, the player update: at turn t, we take action a_t, and then we update to y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta.\n\nSo at the moment we take action a_t, we are at y_t, and then we become at y_{t+1} at the next turn.\n\nTherefore, if we are at (0,9) at turn T, that means we arrived there at the beginning of turn T? And the last action was at turn T-1.\n\nIn our plan: we are at row9 at turn9. So we must have taken an action at turn8 that moved us from row8 to row9.\n\nSo the last action is at turn8. Then the sequence is for turns 1 to 8? So H-1 = 8? Then H=9? But that means the number of turns we are taking is 9? But we are only acting for 8 turns.\n\nI think the problem defines H as the total number of turns from the start until we reach the goal? Including the starting turn? \n\nBut note the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence has H actions? \n\nLet me see the indexing: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so H actions. And we start at turn t_1, so the actions are at turns: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1. Then at turn t_1+H, we would be at the next state? But we want to be at (0,9) at the state after the last action.\n\nSo if we take the last action at turn t_1+H-1, then at turn t_1+H we are at (0,9). But the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd in the player update: after taking action a_t at turn t, we are at y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nSo if we take actions at turns: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1 (H actions), then we are at y_{t_1+H} at turn t_1+H.\n\nWe want that y_{t_1+H} = 9? Then we are at (0,9) at turn t_1+H.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"? \n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t=0 to t=H-1, so the actions are at t_1+0, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1. Then after these actions, we have the state at turn t_1+H? But the problem says \"to reach (0,9)\" at turn t_1+H-1? \n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nBut in the problem statement: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", meaning that after performing these H actions (starting at t_1 and ending at t_1+H-1), we are at (0,9) at the next turn? \n\nBut the next turn is t_1+H. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that at the same turn we take the action, we are already at the new position? But the update rule says: at turn t, we take action a_t, and then y_{t+1} is the new position. So the position at turn t is fixed before the action? \n\nThe problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\" \n\nAnd note: when we are at turn T, we are at row y_T. Then we take an action and move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nSo the position at turn T is y_T. \n\nWe want to be at row 9 at some turn T. \n\nIn our plan, we are at row9 at turn9. \n\nTo get there, we took actions at turns 1 to 8. \n\nSo the sequence of actions is for turns: 1,2,...,8. That is 8 actions. Then H-1=8? So H=9? \n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is for t_1 to t_1+H-1, and then we are at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1? \n\nThat would be: at turn 1+H-1 = 1+9-1=9, we are at (0,9). \n\nSo in that case, we are at (0,9) at turn9, which matches.\n\nTherefore, H=9, and we take actions at turns 1 to 8 (8 actions).\n\nBut is there a faster way? We must go from row1 to row9: 8 moves up. We cannot do it in fewer than 8 actions? Because each action can only move up by at most 1.\n\nSo minimal H is 9? Because we start at turn1 and end at turn9.\n\nBut wait: what if we don't move? Then we stay at row1, but we never get to row9.\n\nWe must take at least 8 up moves.\n\nSo the minimal H is 9? But let me see if we can get there earlier? \n\nWe start at turn1 at row1. After 1 action (at turn1) we are at turn2: we can be at row0,1,2. Then at turn2 we take action, etc. \n\nThe earliest we can be at row9: \n   To go from 1 to 9: 8 steps. So we need at least 8 actions? Then the earliest turn we can be at row9 is turn1+8 = turn9? \n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what if we move up twice in one turn? No, the actions are only U, D, S: each changes by at most 1.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nBut in our plan, we have a path that works? We just go up every turn from turn1 to turn8.\n\nBut we must check if we are safe at every step.\n\nWe did:\n\nTurn1: at row1 -> safe.\nTurn2: at row2 -> safe? We computed: car on row2 at turn2: [ -53+6*(2-1)= -53+6=-47, -42+6=-36] -> [-47,-36] -> 0 not in -> safe.\nTurn3: row3 -> [ -53+6*2 = -53+12=-41, -42+12=-30] -> safe.\nTurn4: row4 -> [ -53+6*3=-35, -42+18=-24] -> safe.\nTurn5: row5 -> [ -53+6*4=-29, -42+24=-18] -> safe.\nTurn6: row6 -> [ -47+36*5=133, -12+180=168] -> safe? But wait, at turn6: T=6, the car on row6: \n   The car: tail=-47, head=-12, speed=36. \n   At T=6: [ -47 + 36*(6-1) = -47+180=133, -12+180=168] -> [133,168] -> safe.\n\nTurn7: row7 -> [ -47+48*6=241, 0+48*6=288] -> safe.\nTurn8: row8 -> [ -47+48*7=289, 0+48*7=336] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn9: row9 -> safe.\n\nBut what about row6 at turn2? We were not on row6 at turn2. We were on row2 at turn2.\n\nSo the path is safe.\n\nBut wait: there is a car on row6 that is dangerous at turn2. But we are not on row6 at turn2. So it's safe.\n\nTherefore, we can do it in 9 turns (H=9) with 8 consecutive U actions.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and we have H=9.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in H=9? We just did.\n\nBut note: we must output the sequence.\n\nSo the answer would be:\n\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\n\nBut wait, we are at row1 at turn1. Then after action U at turn1, we go to row2 at turn2.\n\nThen U at turn2: to row3 at turn3.\n...\nU at turn8: to row9 at turn9.\n\nBut we have 8 actions? The problem says the sequence from t_1 to t_1+H-1: H=9, so from turn1 to turn9-1= turn8. So 8 actions.\n\nBut what about turn9? We don't take an action at turn9 because we are already at the goal? \n\nThe problem says: we are to provide a sequence of actions that when taken from turn t_1 to turn t_1+H-1, we reach the goal at turn t_1+H-1? \n\nBut note: after taking the last action at turn t_1+H-1, we are at the goal at the next turn? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\". \n\nThis is the confusion.\n\nRe-reading the problem: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd in the update: after taking action a_t at turn t, we are at y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, if we take an action at turn t, the result is seen at turn t+1.\n\nWe start at turn t_1 at (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,1).\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at some turn T.\n\nIn our plan: we are at (0,9) at turn9.\n\nWe took actions at turns 1,2,...,8 (8 actions). \n\nSo the sequence of actions is for turns 1 to 8. \n\nThen H-1 = 8? So H=9? \n\nBut the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1? That would be for turns: t_1+0, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nSo if H=9, then the actions are at turns: 1, 2, ..., 1+8=9? \n\nBut we don't take an action at turn9? Because we are done at turn9.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take an action at turn t_1, and then at the same turn we are already at the new state? \n\nBut the update rule clearly says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo the state at turn t is y_t. Then we take action a_t and then we get y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nTherefore, to be at row9 at turn T, we must have taken the last action at turn T-1.\n\nWe are at row1 at turn1. To be at row9 at turn9, we took actions at turns1 to 8.\n\nSo the sequence is for turns1 to 8: 8 actions. \n\nThen the sequence has H-1 actions? But the problem says the sequence has H actions? \n\nThe problem says: {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} -> that's H actions.\n\nBut we have 8 actions. \n\nSo if H=9, then the sequence would be for t=0 to 8: that's 9 actions? \n\nBut we don't need 9 actions.\n\nI think the problem is defining H as the number of actions? But then we reach at turn t_1+H? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\" is not explicitly stated. \n\nLooking back: the problem says \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\" and then in the answer format, it lists actions from turn t_1 to turn t_1+H-1.\n\nBut it doesn't explicitly say at which turn we are at (0,9). But from the update, after the last action at turn t_1+H-1, we are at (0,9) at turn t_1+H.\n\nBut then the problem might be expecting that we are at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1? \n\nAlternatively, there might be a misunderstanding of the indexing.\n\nAnother possibility: the starting turn t_1 is included as turn0? But the problem says \"current turn is t_1\" and \"initial position (0, y_{t_1})\".\n\nAnd the actions start at turn t_1.\n\nLet me see the example: if we do nothing, then we are at row1 at turn1, and then at turn2 we are still at row1 if we do S.\n\nBut in the problem, we start at turn1.\n\nI think the problem means:\n\n- At turn t_1, we are at (0, y_{t_1}) and we take an action a_{t_1}. Then at turn t_1+1, we are at (0, y_{t_1+1}).\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at some turn T.\n\nThe minimal T - t_1 is the number of turns we are waiting? But the problem calls H the \"minimal number of turns\", and then the sequence has H actions? \n\nBut the number of actions is the number of moves we make, which is the number of turns we are acting.\n\nTo resolve, let's assume that after taking the sequence of H actions (at turns t_1 to t_1+H-1), we are at (0,9) at turn t_1+H.\n\nThen for our case, we want to be at (0,9) at turn 1+H = 9, so H=8? But then the sequence has 8 actions? \n\nBut the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, which is H actions. So if H=8, then we have 8 actions at turns 1,2,...,8, and then at turn9 we are at row9.\n\nThen the minimal H (number of actions) is 8.\n\nAnd the minimal number of turns (meaning the number of time steps from start to finish) is 9? But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has H actions.\n\nBut in the answer format, it lists actions for turns: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nFor H=8, that would be turns 1 to 8.\n\nAnd then we are at (0,9) at turn9.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then we list H actions? That is inconsistent because the number of turns (time steps) is 9, but we are calling H=8.\n\nPerhaps the problem defines H as the number of actions? \n\nLet me see the problem: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence has H actions? \n\nIn game terms, a \"turn\" might refer to an action opportunity. So H is the number of actions.\n\nIn that case, we need 8 actions (all U) and we are done.\n\nAnd the answer would be H=8, and the sequence:\n\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\n...\nTurn 8: U\n\nBut then at turn9, we are at row9, which is the goal.\n\nAnd the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" and with the last action (at turn8) we move to row9 at turn9.\n\nBut is turn9 considered part of the game? We don't take an action at turn9.\n\nThe problem doesn't require to be at the goal at the same turn we take the action, but after.\n\nSo I think H=8 is the number of actions.\n\nBut then why is the minimal number of turns H=8? Because we are acting for 8 turns.\n\nAnd the total time from start to finish is 8 actions, so 8 turns of acting, and then the next turn we are there.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and in the context, \"turns\" might mean action turns.\n\nIn the problem statement: \"multi-turn game\", and \"current turn is t_1\", and then we have \"actions\" for turns.\n\nSo it's ambiguous.\n\nTo be safe, let's see if there is a problem with our path.\n\nBut there is a potential problem: at turn2, if we are on row2, but what about the car on row6 at turn2? It's dangerous, but we are not on row6.\n\nSo our path is safe.\n\nBut wait, there is a car on row7 and row8 at turn1: dangerous, but we are not on row7 or 8 at turn1.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nBut the problem is that we are rising through the rows quickly and avoid the dangerous times for row6 (only dangerous at turn2) and for rows2-5 (dangerous at turn8,9) because we pass them before turn8.\n\nBut what if we are delayed? We are not.\n\nSo the direct 8-ups is safe.\n\nBut let me double-check row6 at turn6: we are on row6 at turn6. The car on row6: \n   tail = -47, head = -12, speed=36.\n   At turn6: elapsed time = 6-1=5.\n   Position: tail = -47 + 36*5 = -47+180 = 133\n   head = -12+180 = 168\n   so the car is from 133 to 168. 0 is not in there -> safe.\n\nBut is there any other car that could be dangerous? For example, on row7 at turn7: \n   car: tail=-47, head=0, speed=48.\n   At turn7: elapsed=6 -> tail=-47+48*6= -47+288=241, head=0+288=288 -> [241,288] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly for row8.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is 8 consecutive U actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have 8 actions. So H=8.\n\nThen the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the current turn is t_1=1, and we are to provide actions for turns 1 to 8 (H=8 actions).\n\nAnd then at turn9, we are at row9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" and we do at turn9.\n\nIs turn9 acceptable? Yes.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify that we must be there at a particular turn, just as soon as possible.\n\nAnd 8 actions is minimal.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 7 actions? No, because we need to move up 8 steps.\n\nTherefore, H=8.\n\nBut note: the answer format: we must list the actions for turns 1 to 8.\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=8.\n\nBut in the box, do we include H? No, the answer format only shows the sequence.\n\nThe problem says: \"Answer Format: ...\" and it shows the sequence of actions for the turns.\n\nSo we don't write H explicitly.\n\nBut we must determine H minimally, and then the sequence.\n\nSo we are done.\n\nBut what about the row6 at turn2? We are not on row6 at turn2, so it's safe.\n\nBut what if we did nothing at turn1? Then at turn2 we would be at row1. Then we start moving up. But then we would be at row2 at turn3, row3 at turn4, etc. Then we would be at row6 at turn7? \n   Turn1: S -> turn2: row1\n   Turn2: U -> turn3: row2\n   Turn3: U -> turn4: row3\n   Turn4: U -> turn5: row4\n   Turn5: U -> turn6: row5\n   Turn6: U -> turn7: row6\n   Turn7: U -> turn8: row7\n   Turn8: U -> turn9: row8\n   Turn9: U -> turn10: row9\n\nThat takes 9 actions and 10 turns? So worse.\n\nSo our direct path is best.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 8 consecutive U moves.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). The minimal number of actions required is 8, as each \"U\" action moves the player up by 1, and 8 moves are needed to go from row 1 to row 9. The sequence of actions is determined to be all \"U\" (up) moves, ensuring the player reaches row 9 at turn 9 without any collisions.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Turn 1 (row 1)**: Car on row 1 is at [49, 60] (right-moving, speed 12). 0 ∉ [49, 60] → safe.\n- **Turn 2 (row 2)**: Car on row 2 is at [-47, -36] (right-moving, speed 6). 0 ∉ [-47, -36] → safe.\n- **Turn 3 (row 3)**: Car on row 3 is at [-41, -30] (right-moving, speed 6). 0 ∉ [-41, -30] → safe.\n- **Turn 4 (row 4)**: Car on row 4 is at [-35, -24] (right-moving, speed 6). 0 ∉ [-35, -24] → safe.\n- **Turn 5 (row 5)**: Car on row 5 is at [-29, -18] (right-moving, speed 6). 0 ∉ [-29, -18] → safe.\n- **Turn 6 (row 6)**: Car on row 6 is at [133, 168] (right-moving, speed 36). 0 ∉ [133, 168] → safe.\n- **Turn 7 (row 7)**: Car on row 7 is at [241, 288] (right-moving, speed 48). 0 ∉ [241, 288] → safe.\n- **Turn 8 (row 8)**: Car on row 8 is at [289, 336] (right-moving, speed 48). 0 ∉ [289, 336] → safe.\n- **Turn 9 (row 9)**: No cars on row 9 → safe.\n\nThe path is safe, and the goal is reached at turn 9. The sequence of actions for turns 1 to 8 is all \"U\".\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: U \\\\\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,2) to (0,9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 2.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway from y=1 to y=8, and they move left or right with given speeds. Collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn. Importantly, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So if at turn T, I move to y_{T+1}, I'm still on y_T for collision purposes at turn T, and I arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe car states are given for turn t_1=2. For each freeway, there's a car with head, tail, direction, and speed. I need to compute for each future turn T, whether 0 is in the car's span on that freeway.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but the span is updated based on time. The span at turn T is given by the formula.\n\nFor right-moving cars: span at T is [τ + s*(T - t_1), h + s*(T - t_1)]\n\nThe notation: for right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h], so head is larger, I think. Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 12). But -48 and -59, with right direction? Let's see the values.\n\nhead h = -48, tail τ = -59, direction right, speed 12.\n\nBut for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, but here h = -48, τ = -59, so -48 > -59, yes, so head is at -48, tail at -59, so the car is from -59 to -48, and since it's moving right, it will increase position.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the span, for collision, we care if 0 is in [lower, upper] at turn T.\n\nFor right-moving car, span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nSince τ < h, the lower bound is τ + s*(T-t_1), upper is h + s*(T-t_1)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving based on the direction given.\n\nLet's list all freeways:\n\nFreeway k=1: h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=12\n\nk=2: h=-36, τ=-47, d=right, s=6? Wait, it says (-36, -47, right, 6) but -36 and -47, -36 > -47, so head -36, tail -47.\n\nIn the table, it's written as (head, tail, dir, speed), I assume.\n\nk=3: same as k=2? (-36, -47, right, 6)\n\nk=4: same, (-36, -47, right, 6)\n\nk=5: same, (-36, -47, right, 6)\n\nk=6: (24, -11, right, 36) — head=24, tail=-11? tail should be less than head, -11 < 24, yes.\n\nBut tail -11, head 24, moving right.\n\nk=7: (48, 1, right, 48) head=48, tail=1? 1 to 48, moving right.\n\nk=8: same as k=7, (48, 1, right, 48)\n\nt_1 = 2.\n\nNow, I need to find for each freeway, at which turns T, 0 is in the car's span.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, player is on freeway y_T, and 0 is in span for that freeway at T.\n\nBut y_T is the player's position at turn T.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at turn t_1=2.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nSince I can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, and y=9 is 7 units above y=2, the minimal number of turns without any obstacles would be 7 turns, all U moves. But with cars, I might need to wait or go down sometimes to avoid collisions.\n\nBut going down might not help since I need to go up eventually, and y=0 is a boundary, I can't go below 0.\n\ny min is 0.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway, the times when 0 is occupied, meaning 0 is in the span.\n\nFor a freeway, at turn T, if 0 is in [lower(T), upper(T)], then it's occupied.\n\nThe player must not be on that freeway at that turn if it's occupied.\n\nBut since the player moves at each turn, I need to plan a path through the freeways over time.\n\nThink of it as a grid in time and y-position.\n\nTime turns: from t=2 onwards.\n\ny from 0 to 9.\n\nAt each time t, for each y, if y has a freeway (y=1 to 8), we need to know if that freeway is occupied at t, i.e., if 0 is in the car span at t.\n\nFor y=0 and y=9, there are no cars, so always safe. y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nFrom the problem: \"freeways y = 1, …, 8\", and collision only for y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at (t=2, y=2), needs to reach (t, y=9) for some t.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, once I reach y=9, I can stay there or whatever, but I just need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), but since x is always 0, it's just y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe position is (0, y_t), so x is fixed at 0, only y changes.\n\nAnd we need y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9, so at turn t_1 + H - 1, y=9.\n\nt_1=2, so at turn 2 + H - 1 = H+1, y=9? Let's see.\n\nt_1 + H - 1, since t from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, that's H turns? Actions from t= t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, for t from 0 to H-1, so time indices t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, total H actions, H time steps including start.\n\nAt turn t_1, position is given.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy, and so on, up to after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} = y_{t_1} + sum of Δy.\n\nBut the position at turn t_1 + H is after H actions.\n\nThe sequence is actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H - 1}, and after these H actions, at turn (t_1 + H - 1) + 1 = t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} is set.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9? Let's read carefully.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nFrom the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAt turn t_1 + H - 1, the position should be (0,9).\n\nThe actions are applied from time t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, affecting the position at times t_1+1 to t_1 + H.\n\nAt turn t, before action, position is y_t, then action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nStandard: at turn t, player is at y_t, then chooses action a_t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, player is at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nSo at the start of turn t_1=2, player is at y=2.\n\nThen after action a_2, y_3 is set, and so on.\n\nWe need that at some turn T = t_1 + H - 1, y_T = 9.\n\nAnd T is the turn number when we are at y=9.\n\nThe sequence has H actions: from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H - 1}, which cause the position to change from y_{t_1} to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nSpecifically, y_{t_1} is given, after a_{t_1}, y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}, after a_{t_1+1}, y_{t_1+2}, ..., after a_{t_1 + H - 1}, y_{t_1 + H} = y_{t_1} + sum_{k=0}^{H-1} Δy_{t_1 + k}\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9, not y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=9 is t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H - 1, we are at position y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nThen, after that, we might have actions, but since we reached, we stop at H actions.\n\nThe sequence is up to a_{t_1 + H - 1}, and at turn t_1 + H - 1, y=9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then only one action a_{t_1}, which sets y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy, but we need y_{t_1} =9, but at t_1, y=2, not 9, so H must be at least 7 to go from 2 to 9 with all U.\n\nMinimal H without obstacles: from y=2 to y=9, difference 7, so with 7 U actions, we can reach in 7 turns: after 7 actions, y_{2+7} = y_9 =2 +7=9, so at turn 9, y=9.\n\nt_1 + H - 1 = 2 + H - 1 = H+1, set to 9.\n\nFor example, H=7, t_1 + H -1 =2+7-1=8, and y_8 should be 9.\n\nStart at turn 2, y2=2.\n\nAfter a2, y3 = y2 + Δy2\n\nAfter a3, y4\n\n...\n\nAfter a7, y8 = y2 + sum_{k=2 to7} Δy_k? Indices.\n\nActions a_t for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor t from 2 to 2+H-1.\n\nAction at time t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nSo y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nLet T = t_1 + H -1, so at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nH is the number of actions.\n\nFrom y2 to y_T, with T -2 steps, since from turn 2 to turn T, there are (T - 2) actions? Let's think.\n\nAt turn 2, position y2.\n\nAfter first action a2, y3 is set.\n\nAfter second action a3, y4, and so on, after the k-th action, y_{2+k} is set.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{2+H} is set.\n\nBut we need y_{2 + H -1} =9? Confusion.\n\nI think I have an off-by-one issue.\n\nDefine: at time t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t is taken at time t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t = t_1 to t = t_1 + H -1 inclusive, so H actions: a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nThis causes the positions from y_{t_1 +1} to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nSpecifically, y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1} from a_{t_1}\n\ny_{t_1 +2} = y_{t_1 +1} + Δy_{t_1 +1} from a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\ny_{t_1 + H} = y_{t_1 + H -1} + Δy_{t_1 + H -1} from a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nWe need that at some turn, y =9, and it should be at turn t_1 + H -1, so y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if at turn T, y_T=9, then T = t_1 + H -1, so H = T - t_1 +1.\n\nIf T=2, y2=9, then H-1=0, so H=1, but y2=2≠9, so not possible.\n\nFirst possible at T=3, if I go U, y3=3, not 9.\n\nTo have y_T=9 for T as small as possible.\n\nSince y2=2, the earliest to reach y9 is at turn 9 with all U: from turn 2 to 3, y3=3; ... to turn 9, y9=9. So T=9, t_1=2, so t_1 + H -1 =9, so 2 + H -1 =9, thus H=8.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =9, 2 + H -1 =9, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nActions from a2 to a9, 8 actions, leading to y3 to y10, but we need y9=9.\n\nWith all U: a2 U, y3=3; a3 U, y4=4; ... a8 U, y9=9; then at turn 9, y9=9. And we have action a9, but it doesn't affect the position at turn 9, since y9 is already set before a9.\n\nIn the sequence, we include a9? For turn t_1 + H -1 =2+8-1=9, so a9 is included, but a9 sets y10, which is after we reached y9.\n\nBut we only care that at turn 9, y9=9.\n\nSimilarly, if I reach earlier, but with obstacles, it might take more turns.\n\nMinimal T is 9 with all U, but we have to avoid collisions.\n\nBack to the cars.\n\nI need to find for each freeway y=1 to 8, for each future turn T, whether the freeway is occupied at T, i.e., if 0 is in the car's span at T.\n\nThen, for the player to be safe at turn T on freeway y, it must not be occupied at T.\n\nAlso, when moving, if at turn T, I am on y_T, and I move to y_{T+1}, at turn T I am on y_T, so if y_T has a freeway and occupied, I collide if I am on it.\n\nIf I move to a new y, at turn T I am not on that new y yet.\n\nFor example, if at turn T, I am on y=5, and I move to y=6, then at turn T, I am on y=5, so I care about freeway 5 at T. At turn T+1, I am on y=6, so I care about freeway 6 at T+1.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the times when 0 is in the span.\n\nGeneral formula for a car on freeway k.\n\nAt turn T, span lower and upper.\n\nFor right-moving: lower(T) = τ + s*(T - t_1)\n\nupper(T) = h + s*(T - t_1)\n\n0 in span if lower(T) <= 0 <= upper(T)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right-moving here.\n\nt_1=2.\n\nLet’s make a table for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: τ = -59, h = -48, s=12, right\n\nlower(T) = -59 + 12*(T - 2)\n\nupper(T) = -48 + 12*(T - 2)\n\n0 in span if -59 + 12(T-2) <= 0 <= -48 + 12(T-2)\n\nSolve for T.\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 12(T-2) <= 0 => 12(T-2) <= 59 => T-2 <= 59/12 = 4.916, so T-2 <= 4 since T integer? T turn number, integer.\n\nT-2 <= floor(59/12) but inequality.\n\n12(T-2) <= 59, T-2 <= 59/12 = 4 + 11/12, so T-2 <= 4 since 4*12=48<59, 5*12=60>59? 12*4=48, 12*5=60.\n\n12(T-2) <= 59, so T-2 <= 59/12 ≈4.916, so for integer T, T-2 <= 4, so T <= 6.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -48 + 12(T-2) => 48 <= 12(T-2) => 12(T-2) >= 48 => T-2 >= 4.\n\nSo T-2 >= 4 and T-2 <= 4? From above:\n\nFrom lower <=0: 12(T-2) <=59, T-2 <=4.916, so T-2 <=4 since T integer? T-2 <=4 for the inequality to hold? Let's see.\n\n-59 +12(T-2) <=0 implies 12(T-2) <=59, since 12*4=48<=59, 12*5=60>59, so for T-2=4, 48<=59 true; T-2=5, 60>59 false? 12(T-2) <=59.\n\n12*4=48 <=59, true; 12*5=60 <=59? 60>59 false, so T-2 <=4? T-2=4, 48<=59 true; T-2=5, 60<=59 false. So T-2 <=4 for this inequality.\n\nSimilarly, upper >=0: 0 <= -48 +12(T-2) => 12(T-2) >=48 => T-2 >=4.\n\nSo T-2 >=4 and T-2 <=4, so T-2=4.\n\nThus only when T-2=4, T=6.\n\nCheck: at T=6, lower= -59 +12*(4) = -59+48= -11\n\nupper= -48 +48=0\n\nSo span [-11, 0], so 0 is included.\n\nAt T=5, T-2=3, lower= -59 +12*3= -59+36= -23, upper= -48+36= -12, span [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nT=6, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nT=7, T-2=5, lower= -59+60=1, upper= -48+60=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, occupied only at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 2: k=2, τ=-47, h=-36, s=6, right\n\nlower(T) = -47 + 6*(T-2)\n\nupper(T) = -36 + 6*(T-2)\n\n0 in span if -47 +6(T-2) <=0 <= -36 +6(T-2)\n\nFirst: -47 +6(T-2) <=0 => 6(T-2) <=47 => T-2 <= 47/6 ≈7.833, so T-2 <=7\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 +6(T-2) => 6(T-2) >=36 => T-2 >=6\n\nSo T-2 >=6 and T-2 <=7.833, so T-2=6 or 7\n\nT-2=6: lower= -47+36= -11, upper= -36+36=0, span [-11,0], 0 in\n\nT-2=7: lower= -47+42= -5, upper= -36+42=6, span [-5,6], 0 in\n\nT-2=8: lower= -47+48=1, upper= -36+48=12, 0 not in\n\nSo occupied at T=8 and T=9? T-2=6, T=8; T-2=7, T=9\n\nt_1=2, T-2=6, T=8; T-2=7, T=9.\n\nT=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? k=3: (-36,-47,right,6) same as k=2, so occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same, T=8,9\n\nFreeway 5: same, T=8,9\n\nAll k=2,3,4,5 are identical: τ=-47,h=-36,s=6, so occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway 6: k=6, (24,-11,right,36) head=24, tail=-11? span at t_1: [τ,h] = [-11,24]? For right-moving, span(t1)=[τ,h] so lower=τ, upper=h.\n\nτ=-11, h=24, s=36\n\nlower(T) = -11 + 36*(T-2)\n\nupper(T) = 24 + 36*(T-2)\n\n0 in span if -11 +36(T-2) <=0 <= 24 +36(T-2)\n\nFirst: -11 +36(T-2) <=0 => 36(T-2) <=11 => T-2 <= 11/36 ≈0.305, so T-2 <=0 since integer? T-2 <= floor(11/36)=0, so T-2=0? 36*0=0 <=11 true, but T-2=0, T=2.\n\nAt T=2, lower= -11 +0 = -11, upper=24+0=24, span [-11,24], 0 in.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 24 +36(T-2), which is always true since 24 + something >=24>0 for T>=2.\n\nBut the first inequality must hold: lower <=0 <= upper.\n\nAt T=2, lower=-11<=0, upper=24>=0, yes.\n\nNow, for T>2: at T=3, T-2=1, lower= -11+36=25, upper=24+36=60, span [25,60], 0 not <=25, so 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for higher T.\n\nSo only at T=2, occupied for freeway 6.\n\nBut at T=2, we are at turn 2, player is on y=2, but freeway 6 is y=6, different freeway. So at turn 2, player is on y=2, freeway 2? y=2 is freeway 2.\n\nBut for freeway 6, it is occupied at T=2, but since player is not on y=6 at T=2, no collision. Only when player is on that y at that turn.\n\nSo for freeway 6, only occupied at T=2, but not relevant for us except if we are on y=6 at T=2, but we are not.\n\nNow freeway 7: k=7, (48,1,right,48) head=48, tail=1, s=48\n\nlower(T) = 1 + 48*(T-2)  // since τ=1\n\nupper(T) = 48 + 48*(T-2)\n\n0 in span if 1 +48(T-2) <=0 <= 48 +48(T-2)\n\nFirst: 1 +48(T-2) <=0? 1 + something, min at T=2, 1>0, so 1 +48(T-2) >=1 >0 for all T>=2, so lower >=1 >0, thus 0 < lower, so 0 never <= upper and >= lower? lower is at least 1, so 0 cannot be >= lower since lower>0, so 0 not in span for any T.\n\nSimilarly, upper is at least 48>0.\n\nSo freeway 7 never occupied.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8: same as k=7, (48,1,right,48), same, never occupied.\n\nk=8 is identical.\n\nSo summary of occupied times:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): occupied only at T=6\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): occupied at T=8 and T=9\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): occupied at T=8 and T=9\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): occupied at T=8 and T=9\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): occupied at T=8 and T=9\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): occupied only at T=2 (but not relevant)\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): never occupied\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): never occupied\n\nFreeway 6 occupied only at T=2, but since we start at T=2 on y=2, not on y=6, and for later times, not occupied, so y=6 is always safe except at T=2, but we can be there at other times.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and y=8 always safe.\n\ny=1 occupied only at T=6.\n\ny=2 to y=5 occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow, player starts at T=2, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn, say T_reach.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, we can go directly if possible.\n\nBut y=2 to y=9, minimal 7 steps: from T=2 to T=9, y from 2 to 9 with 7 U moves.\n\nBut let's see if this path is possible with the occupied times.\n\nFirst, at each turn, we need to be on a safe y.\n\nStart T=2, y=2. Freeway 2 is occupied at T=8 and T=9, but not at T=2. At T=2, is y=2 occupied?\n\nFor freeway 2: at T=2, t_1=2, T-2=0, lower= -47 +0= -47, upper= -36 +0= -36, span [-47,-36], 0 not in, so not occupied at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, occupied only at T=8,9 as above.\n\nSo at T=2, y=2 is safe.\n\nNow, if we go all U:\n\nTurn 2: at y=2, safe. Action U, to y=3 at T=3.\n\nT=3: y=3. Freeway 3 occupied? At T=3, T-2=1, for freeway 3, lower= -47 +6*1= -41, upper= -36+6= -30, span [-41,-30], 0 not in, safe. Action U, to y=4.\n\nT=4: y=4. Freeway 4, T-2=2, lower= -47+12= -35, upper= -36+12= -24? s=6, T-2=2, lower= -47+12= -35, upper= -36+12= -24, span [-35,-24], 0 not in, safe. U to y=5.\n\nT=5: y=5. Freeway 5, T-2=3, lower= -47+18= -29, upper= -36+18= -18, span [-29,-18], 0 not in, safe. U to y=6.\n\nT=6: y=6. Freeway 6, at T=6, T-2=4, lower= -11 +36*4? Freeway 6: s=36, lower(T)= τ + s(T-2) = -11 +36(T-2)\n\nAt T=6, T-2=4, lower= -11 + 144 = 133? 36*4=144, -11+144=133, upper=24+144=168, span [133,168], 0 not in. And earlier only occupied at T=2, so safe. Action U to y=7.\n\nT=7: y=7. Freeway 7 never occupied, safe. U to y=8.\n\nT=8: y=8. Freeway 8 never occupied, safe. But we need to go to y=9.\n\nAt T=8, y=8, action U to y=9.\n\nThen at T=9, y=9, which is safe.\n\nBut we need to check if at T=8, when we are on y=8, it is safe, yes.\n\nBut at T=8, y=8 is safe, no issue.\n\nThe problem is that for y=2 to y=5, they are occupied at T=8 and T=9, but in this path, at T=8 we are on y=8, not on y=2-5, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly at T=9, we are on y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo this path seems safe: all U from T=2 to T=8, actions a2 to a8, with H=7 actions? Let's see the turns.\n\nStart T=2, y=2.\n\nAfter a2=U, T=3, y=3\n\na3=U, T=4, y=4\n\na4=U, T=5, y=5\n\na5=U, T=6, y=6\n\na6=U, T=7, y=7\n\na7=U, T=8, y=8\n\nNow, at T=8, y=8, we need to reach y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=2, we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt T=8, y=8, not 9.\n\nWe need one more action: a8=U, then T=9, y=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=9, which is the turn we reach.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =2 + H -1 = H+1\n\nSet to 9, so H+1=9, H=8.\n\nActions from a2 to a9? a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a2 to a_{2+8-1} = a9.\n\na2 to a9, 8 actions.\n\nSequence: a2 U, a3 U, a4 U, a5 U, a6 U, a7 U, a8 U, a9 U? But after a8, y9 is set, but at turn 9, y9=9.\n\nIn the sequence, a9 is included, but after a9, y10 is set, but we don't care.\n\nIn the path above, with a2 to a8: 7 actions? Let's list:\n\nAt T=2, before action, y2=2. Action a2: if U, y3=3.\n\nT=3, y3=3, action a3: U, y4=4\n\n...\n\nT=7, y7=7, action a7: U, y8=8\n\nT=8, y8=8, action a8: U, y9=9\n\nThen at T=9, y9=9.\n\nNow, to have y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{2 + H -1} =9, so 2 + H -1 =9, H-1=7, H=8.\n\nActions from a2 to a_{2+8-1} = a9.\n\nIn the above, we have actions up to a8 to reach y9 at T=9.\n\na2 to a8: that's 7 actions? a2,a3,a4,a5,a6,a7,a8: that's 7 actions, leading to y3 to y9.\n\nAfter a8, y9 is set.\n\nThe actions are a2 to a8, which is t from t1 to t1+6? t1=2, a2 to a8, that's 7 actions: indices 2 to 8.\n\nt1 + H -1 =8, so 2 + H -1 =8, H-1=6, H=7? Inconsistency.\n\nt1 + H -1 = turn number when we are at y=9.\n\nSet T_reach = t1 + H -1 =9.\n\nThen H = T_reach - t1 +1.\n\nSince t1=2, T_reach=9, H=9-2+1=8.\n\nActions from a2 to a_{2+8-1} = a9? a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1} = a2 to a_{2+7} = a9? t1 + H -1 =2 +8-1=9, so a9 is included.\n\nBut in the sequence above, to reach y9 at T=9, we need actions up to a8, which sets y9.\n\na8 is the action at T=8 that sets y9.\n\nThen at T=9, we are at y9.\n\nNow, for the action sequence, it should include a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, which for H=8, a2 to a9.\n\nBut at T=9, we are already at y9, so a9 could be anything, but since we reached, we can set a9=S or something, but the position doesn't change, but we need to specify the action.\n\nIn this case, to minimize H, we can set a9=S, but H is the same.\n\nIn the all U path, we use a2 to a8 all U to go from y2=2 to y9=9 in 7 actions? Let's count the actions.\n\nStart: T=2, y2=2\n\nAction a2: U, then y3=3\n\na3: U, y4=4\n\na4: U, y5=5\n\na5: U, y6=6\n\na6: U, y7=7\n\na7: U, y8=8\n\na8: U, y9=9\n\nNow, after a8, at T=9, y9=9.\n\nWe have used actions a2 to a8, that's 7 actions.\n\nt1 + H -1 = turn when y=9, which is T=9.\n\nt1=2, so 2 + H -1 =9, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nBut with 7 actions, we have y9=9 at T=9.\n\nThe actions are from a2 to a8, which is t from t1 to t1+6? t1=2, a2 to a8, the last index is 8, which is t1 +6? 2+6=8.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t1} = a2\n\nt=1, a_{t1+1}=a3\n\n...\n\nt=H-1, a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nAnd at turn t1 + H -1, y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nHere, at turn 9, y9=9, so t1 + H -1 =9, 2 + H -1=9, H-1=7, H=8.\n\nThen the actions are for t=0 to 7: a_{2+0} to a_{2+7} = a2 to a9.\n\nBut in the path above, to have y9=9, we only need a2 to a8, and a9 is not needed for reaching, but since we must include H actions up to a9, we can set a9=S, for example.\n\nBut y9=9 already, so a9=S keeps it at 9.\n\nBut in terms of reaching, at T=9, we are at y=9.\n\nSimilarly, if we set a9=U, y10=10, but y max 9, so probably clamped or invalid, but since we only care about reaching at T=9, it might be ok, but better to stay.\n\nBut the point is, with H=8, we include an extra action.\n\nBut minimal H: with all U, we can reach at T=9 with 7 actions? But according to the formula, H=8.\n\nPerhaps I have a misunderstanding.\n\nLet me read the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, so H actions, applied at times t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThe position at turn t1 + H -1 is after the first H-1 actions? Let's think carefully.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} is set.\n\nAfter action a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2} is set.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H -1}, y_{t1 + H} is set.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is the position at turn t1 + H -1, which is set by action a_{t1 + H -2}, I think.\n\nFor example, at turn t, y_t is given, action a_t sets y_{t+1}.\n\nSo y_{t+1} depends on a_t.\n\nTherefore, y_{t1 + H -1} is set by action a_{t1 + H -2}.\n\nAnd it is the position at the start of turn t1 + H -1, or after action? Typically, at turn t, we are at y_t, then take action a_t.\n\nSo at turn t1 + H -1, we are at y_{t1 + H -1}, which was set by previous action.\n\nThen we take action a_{t1 + H -1} to set y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut for reaching, we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9 at that turn.\n\nIn the sequence, we include a_{t1 + H -1}, which is after we reached.\n\nFor example, to have y9=9 at T=9, we need to have taken actions that set y9=9, which is done by a8 at T=8.\n\nThen at T=9, we are at y9=9, and we take a9.\n\nSo for the sequence, to include up to a9, H=8.\n\nWith 7 actions a2 to a8, we can set y9=9, and be at T=9 with y=9.\n\nThen for H=7, t1 + H -1 =2+7-1=8, so y8 should be 9.\n\nBut with all U, at T=8, y8=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y8=9, we need to reach earlier, which requires moving faster, but we can only move one step per turn, so from y2=2 to y8=9 in 6 steps? 9-2=7, so in 6 steps, we can at most reach y2+6=8, so y8=8 at T=8, cannot be 9.\n\nMinimal turn to reach y9 is T=9, with y9=9.\n\nSo H must be at least 8 for t1=2.\n\nWith H=8, t1 + H -1 =2+8-1=9, y9=9.\n\nActions a2 to a9, with a2 to a8 U, and a9 S or U, but U would go to 10, invalid, so S.\n\nBut in the all U path, it works, as we saw.\n\nBut in the path, at T=6, we were on y=6, which is safe.\n\nAt T=8, we are on y=8, safe.\n\nBut freeway 2 is occupied at T=8 and T=9, but we are not on y=2 at those times.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIs there any issue at T=6?\n\nAt T=6, if we are on y=1, it is occupied, but in this path, we are on y=6 at T=6.\n\nAll seems fine.\n\nBut the player starts at y=2, T=2.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to output actions from turn t1.\n\nBut in this case, with all U, we can reach at T=9 with no problem.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier? Earlier than T=9? From y=2, to y=9, need at least 7 moves up, so from T=2 to T=9, 7 steps, so T=9 is earliest possible.\n\nWith actions from T=2 to T=8, 7 actions, but as above, y9 is set at T=9 after a8.\n\nPosition at T=9 is set.\n\nTo be at y=9 at an earlier turn, not possible.\n\nSo minimal T_reach=9.\n\nWith H=8, we can do it.\n\nBut in the occupied times, at T=8, freeways 2,3,4,5 are occupied, but we are on y=8, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly at T=9, we are on y=9, safe.\n\nNow, but in the path, we go through y=2 to y=8 at various times, all safe.\n\nFor example, at T=2, y=2, safe.\n\nT=3, y=3, safe (since occupied only at T=8,9)\n\nSimilarly up to T=7, y=7, safe.\n\nT=8, y=8, safe.\n\nT=9, y=9.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can do with less H, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps we need to avoid being on certain y at certain times, but in this case no need.\n\nAnother thing: at T=6, freeway 1 is occupied, but we are not on y=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the all U sequence should work.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nt1=2.\n\nH=8.\n\nActions: for turn 2 to turn 9? a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1} = a2 to a9.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 2: a2 = U\n\nTurn 3: a3 = U\n\nTurn 4: a4 = U\n\nTurn 5: a5 = U\n\nTurn 6: a6 = U\n\nTurn 7: a7 = U\n\nTurn 8: a8 = U  // this sets y9=9\n\nTurn 9: a9 = ?  // at turn 9, y9=9, we need to specify action, but since we reached, we can set S or U, but U would go to y10=10, which might be clamped to 9 or invalid, but to be safe, set S.\n\nThe problem says y in [0,9], so probably y=10 not allowed, so action U at y=9 might not be possible or clamped to 9.\n\nBut to avoid issue, set a9=S.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output actions until we reach.\n\nBut with a2 to a8 U, we reach at T=9.\n\nThen a9 can be S.\n\nBut H=8 requires 8 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can reach with H=7 if we start from different point, but no.\n\nAnother thought: if at some point we move faster, but we can't, only one step per turn.\n\nSo all U is fine.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 6, it was occupied at T=2, but we were not on it.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps at T=8, if we were on y=2, it would be occupied, but we are not.\n\nSo I think the minimal H is 8, with sequence U,U,U,U,U,U,U,S for actions a2 to a9.\n\na2 to a8 all U, a9 S.\n\nBut let's list the turns.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1} = U for turn 2\n\nTurn t1 +1: a_{t1+1} = U for turn 3\n\n...\n\nTurn t1 +6: a_{t1+6} = a8 = U for turn 8\n\nTurn t1 +7: a_{t1+7} = a9 = S for turn 9? t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to 7 for H=8.\n\nt=0: turn t1 +0 =2, action U\n\nt=1: turn 3, action U\n\nt=2: turn 4, U\n\nt=3: turn 5, U\n\nt=4: turn 6, U\n\nt=5: turn 7, U\n\nt=6: turn 8, U\n\nt=7: turn 9, action? We set S.\n\nBut at turn 9, after action, y10 would be set, but we don't care.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nSince at turn 9, y=9, and we need to output action for turn 9, set S to stay.\n\nNow, but is there a way with H smaller? No.\n\nPerhaps we can go down and up to avoid, but no need, and it would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if we were forced to avoid T=6 on y=1, but we don't go there.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut let's double-check the occupied times.\n\nAt T=6, freeway 1 occupied, but y=1 is freeway, if player is on y=1 at T=6, collision.\n\nIn our path, at T=6, we are on y=6.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, freeways 2-5 occupied, but we are on y=8.\n\nAt T=9, freeways 2-5 occupied, but we are on y=9.\n\nAll safe.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster by being at y=9 earlier, but impossible.\n\nAnother thing: the player can stay or move down, but that would delay.\n\nSo minimal H is 8.\n\nBut in the sequence, with a2 to a8 U, and a9 S.\n\nBut for the output, we need to write the actions.\n\nBut let's see if at any point we need to avoid.\n\nFor example, at T=8, if we were on y=5, it would be occupied, but we are not.\n\nIn the path to y=9, we might pass through y=5 at earlier time.\n\nIn all U, we are on y=5 at T=5, which is safe, since occupied only at T=8,9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 6, occupied at T=2, but at T=2 we are on y=2, not y=6.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", but H is the number of actions, I think.\n\nNow, in the output, we need to box the sequence.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nFirst, H=8.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nBut turn 9 is t1 + H -1? t1=2, H=8, t1 + H -1=9, yes.\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 2: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & S \\\\ \\end{array} }\n\nBut at turn 9, we are already at y=9, so S is fine.\n\nTo make it consistent, since we reach at turn 9 with y=9, and action at turn 9 can be S.\n\nBut is S necessary? We can set U, but y=10 not allowed, so probably should avoid, or it might be invalid.\n\nThe problem says \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\", so if at y=9, action U, y_{t+1} =10, not in [0,9], so probably not allowed or undefined.\n\nTo be safe, set S.\n\nPerhaps the game clamps to 9, but not specified.\n\nSo better to set S at turn 9.\n\nBut in terms of minimal H, since we need to include the action, H=8 is fixed for reaching at T=9.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at T=8 with y8=9, but impossible from y2=2 in 6 steps.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nBut let's confirm the car for freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6: at T=2, occupied, but player on y=2, not affected.\n\nIn the path, at T=6, we are on y=6, which is freeway 6, and at T=6, not occupied, as computed.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) is 8. The sequence of actions ensures the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 2 + 8 - 1 = 9\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Collision Avoidance Analysis:\n- Freeway \\(y = 1\\) is occupied only at turn 6. The player is not on \\(y = 1\\) at turn 6.\n- Freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\) are occupied at turns 8 and 9. The player is not on these freeways at these turns.\n- Freeway \\(y = 6\\) is occupied only at turn 2. The player is not on \\(y = 6\\) at turn 2 and is safe at other turns.\n- Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are never occupied, so they are always safe.\n- The player path: at turn 2 (\\(y=2\\)), turn 3 (\\(y=3\\)), turn 4 (\\(y=4\\)), turn 5 (\\(y=5\\)), turn 6 (\\(y=6\\)), turn 7 (\\(y=7\\)), turn 8 (\\(y=8\\)), and reaches \\(y=9\\) at turn 9. All positions are safe at their respective turns.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- Actions from turn 2 to turn 8 are all \"U\" (up) to move from \\(y=2\\) to \\(y=9\\) in 7 steps.\n- At turn 9, the player is at \\(y=9\\), so the action is \"S\" (stay) to remain at \\(y=9\\) without moving out of bounds.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 2: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & S \\\\ \\end{array} }",

The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The movement is in the y-direction only (vertical). The grid has y from 0 to 9.\n\nImportant note: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway k (which is at y=k) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes the x-coordinate 0.\n\nAlso note: When the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, they are considered to be on y_T during the entire turn T. Therefore, at turn T, they are only at risk of collision from the car on freeway y_T. When they move, they leave freeway y_T and enter y_{T+1} at the next turn.\n\nCar update:\n- Left-moving: the car moves left, so the entire span shifts left by s per turn.\n- Right-moving: the car moves right, so the entire span shifts right by s per turn.\n\nGiven the car states at turn t1=3:\n\nFreeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 12) -> This is a right-moving car. Note: the head is at -36 and tail at -47? But for a right-moving car, the head should be the front (which is the larger x if moving right) but here -36 > -47 so head is at -36 and tail at -47. As it moves right, the positions increase.\n\nBut note: the description says for right-moving: [τ, h] -> meaning the tail is at τ and head at h? Actually, the given is (head, tail, direction, speed). So for freeway 1: head=-36, tail=-47, direction=right, speed=12.\n\nSince it's moving right, at time T (from t1=3), the car's position at time T (T>=3) is:\n  head(T) = -36 + 12*(T-3)\n  tail(T) = -47 + 12*(T-3)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nWe need to avoid being at freeway k at time T when the car on that freeway has 0 in [tail(T), head(T)] (if right-moving) or [head(T), tail(T)] (if left-moving) but note that for right-moving, the tail is the leftmost and head the rightmost? Actually, the given representation for right-moving is [τ, h] meaning from τ to h, so τ < h. But in the freeway1 example: tail=-47, head=-36 -> so the car spans from -47 to -36? Then as it moves right, both increase.\n\nBut note: the update rule for right-moving: \n  [τ, h] at t1 becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] at T.\n\nSo for freeway1 at time T: \n  span = [-47 + 12*(T-3), -36 + 12*(T-3)]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway2: (-30, -41, right, 6) -> tail=-41, head=-30? Actually the tuple is (head, tail, ...). So head=-30, tail=-41? Then the span for freeway2 at T is: [-41 + 6*(T-3), -30 + 6*(T-3)]\n\nBut wait: the table says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\". So for freeway2: h=-30, τ=-41, d=right, s=6.\n\nSo the initial span at t1=3 is [τ, h] = [-41, -30] for freeway2? But note that -41 < -30, so the car is from -41 to -30. Then at time T, the car is at: [ -41 + 6*(T-3), -30 + 6*(T-3) ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway3,4,5: same as freeway2.\n\nFreeway6: (60, 25, right, 36) -> head=60, tail=25? But then the span at t1=3 is [25,60]? But wait: the representation for right-moving is [τ, h] and τ should be the tail (which is the left end) and h the head (the right end). So if tail=25 and head=60, then the car is from 25 to 60. Then at time T: [25+36*(T-3), 60+36*(T-3)]\n\nBut note: the given tuple is (head, tail) so (60,25) meaning head=60, tail=25. Then the car is from tail=25 to head=60? So the span is [25,60] at t1=3.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 and 8: (96,49,right,48) -> head=96, tail=49, so span [49,96] at t1=3.\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,3) at turn t1=3. We must plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) to get to y=9 in minimal H.\n\nWe note that the player must go from y=3 to y=9, so at least 6 steps if we go up every time. But we have to avoid the freeways when a car is at x=0.\n\nWe are only concerned with the freeways we are on at each turn. Since we start at y=3, we are on freeway 3? But note: the freeways are at y=1,2,...,8. The player is at y=3, so freeway k=3.\n\nWe must avoid being at freeway k at time T if the car on freeway k has 0 in its span at that time.\n\nWe are going to simulate the car positions at each turn and plan a path.\n\nWe'll consider turns starting at t=3, then t=4, t=5, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe want minimal H, so we try to go up as much as possible, but we must avoid collisions.\n\nLet's compute for each freeway and each future turn T (>=3) when the car on that freeway will have 0 in its span.\n\nFor freeway k, we have:\n\nFreeway 1 (right, s=12): \n  Span at T: [ -47 + 12*(T-3), -36 + 12*(T-3) ]\n  We require 0 in [ -47+12*(T-3), -36+12*(T-3) ]\n  => -47 + 12*(T-3) <= 0 <= -36 + 12*(T-3)\n  => 12*(T-3) >= 47   and 12*(T-3) >= 36? Actually, the first condition: -47 + 12*(T-3) <= 0 -> 12*(T-3) <= 47 -> T-3 <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916 -> T <= 6.916 -> T=4,5,6\n  and the second: 0 <= -36 + 12*(T-3) -> 12*(T-3) >= 36 -> T-3 >= 3 -> T>=6.\n\n  So both conditions: T>=6 and T<= floor(47/12+3)= floor(3+3.916)=6. So T=6? Let's check:\n\n  At T=6: \n    left = -47 + 12*3 = -47+36 = -11\n    right = -36 + 36 = 0 -> so 0 is included? Actually, the interval is [-11, 0]. So 0 is included? Yes, because the car spans from -11 to 0. So at T=6, freeway1 is dangerous.\n\n  At T=7: \n    left = -47 + 12*4 = -47+48 = 1\n    right = -36+48=12 -> so [1,12] does not include 0 -> safe.\n\n  So freeway1 is dangerous at T=6.\n\nFreeway 2 (right, s=6): \n  Span: [ -41 + 6*(T-3), -30 + 6*(T-3) ]\n  0 in [a,b] means a<=0<=b.\n  => -41 + 6*(T-3) <= 0  => 6*(T-3) <= 41 -> T-3 <= 41/6 ≈ 6.833 -> T<=9.833 -> T=4 to 9?\n  and 0 <= -30 + 6*(T-3) -> 6*(T-3) >= 30 -> T-3>=5 -> T>=8.\n\n  So T>=8 and T<=9 (since T-3<= floor(41/6)=6, but 6.833 -> so T=8,9).\n\n  Check T=8: \n    left = -41 + 6*5 = -41+30 = -11\n    right = -30+30=0 -> so [-11,0] -> includes 0 -> dangerous.\n  T=9:\n    left = -41+6*6 = -41+36 = -5\n    right = -30+36=6 -> [-5,6] -> includes 0 -> dangerous.\n\n  T=10: \n    left = -41+6*7 = -41+42=1 -> [1,12] -> safe.\n\n  So freeway2 dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway3: same as freeway2 -> dangerous at T=8,9.\n\nFreeway4: same -> dangerous at T=8,9.\n\nFreeway5: same -> dangerous at T=8,9.\n\nFreeway6 (right, s=36): \n  Span: [25+36*(T-3), 60+36*(T-3)]\n  0 in [a,b] -> a<=0<=b.\n  But a=25+36*(T-3) is positive for T>=3 -> so 0 is not in the interval. This car is always to the right of 0? \n  At T=3: [25,60] -> all positive -> 0 not included.\n  And as T increases, the car moves right -> so never covers 0. So freeway6 is always safe.\n\nFreeway7 (right, s=48): \n  Span: [49+48*(T-3), 96+48*(T-3)]\n  Similarly, at T=3: [49,96] -> positive and increasing -> never covers 0. Safe.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7 -> safe.\n\nSo summary of dangerous freeways at each turn:\n\nTurn T=3: \n  We are at y=3 -> freeway3? But note: we are at turn T=3 and we are on freeway3. \n  But freeway3 is dangerous only at T=8,9 -> so at T=3, freeway3 is safe.\n\nTurn T=4: \n  We might be on freeway3 or move to freeway4? \n  We need to consider the freeway we are on at T=4.\n\nBut let's list the dangers per freeway and turn:\n\nFreeway1: dangerous at T=6\nFreeway2: dangerous at T=8,9\nFreeway3: dangerous at T=8,9\nFreeway4: dangerous at T=8,9\nFreeway5: dangerous at T=8,9\nFreeway6: safe\nFreeway7: safe\nFreeway8: safe\n\nWe start at T=3, y=3 (freeway3). We must avoid being on:\n\n- freeway1 at T=6\n- freeway2 at T=8,9\n- freeway3 at T=8,9\n- freeway4 at T=8,9\n- freeway5 at T=8,9\n\nOur goal is to reach y=9. Note that freeways 1-5 are dangerous at specific turns, and 6-8 are safe.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway1 at T=6. Since freeway1 is at y=1, we must not be on y=1 at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid being on y=2,3,4,5 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nWe start at y=3 at T=3.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nThe minimal steps without obstacles: 6 steps (all U): \n  T=3: y=3 -> then T=4: y=4, T=5: y=5, T=6: y=6, T=7: y=7, T=8: y=8, T=9: y=9 -> but wait, at T=9 we are at y=9? Actually, we need to be at y=9 at the last turn. But note the turn count: we start at T=3 at y=3. After one U at T=3, at T=4 we are at y=4. After two U: T=5: y=5. Three: T=6: y=6. Four: T=7: y=7. Five: T=8: y=8. Six: T=9: y=9. So H=6? But then we are at y=9 at T=9? And the sequence would be for t=3 to t=8? Actually, we need H actions: from t1=3 to t1+H-1. So if H=6, we have actions at T=3,4,5,6,7,8 and then at T=9 we are at y=9? But the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning the actions are taken at times: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the player arrives at the position at time t1+H? Actually, the update is: at turn t, we take action a_t, then we get y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta.\n\nSo if we start at t1=3 at y3=3, then:\n  At t=3: take action a3 -> then y4 = y3 + Delta\n  At t=4: take a4 -> y5 = y4 + Delta\n  ...\n  We want y_{t1+H} = 9? But note: the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". Actually, let me read: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nSo the player must be at (0,9) at the end of the sequence, which is at time t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, if we let the actions be taken at times: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, then the position after the last action is at time t1+H-1 + 1? But no: the position after the action at time t is at time t+1.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"reach at turn t1+H-1\". So at turn T = t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). How do we achieve that?\n\nWe start at turn t1 (T0 = t1) at (0,y0). Then we take an action at T0, which leads to position at T0+1. Then at T0+1 we take an action, leading to T0+2, and so on. We want at some turn T = t1+H-1 to be at (0,9). \n\nBut note: the position at turn T is determined by the actions taken at turns T-1, T-2, ... \n\nSo if we want to be at (0,9) at turn T, then we must have taken actions from turn t1 to T-1? Actually, we start at turn t1 at (0,3). Then we take actions at turn t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nHow is that possible? Consider: at turn t1 we take an action, which updates the position at turn t1+1. Then at turn t1+1 we take an action, updating to turn t1+2, ... until at turn t1+H-1 we take the last action, which updates the position at turn t1+H. But the problem says \"reach at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the problem: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd note: the player update is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, meaning the action at time t determines the position at time t+1.\n\nTherefore, at the start of turn t, the player is at y_t. Then we choose a_t, and then at the start of turn t+1, the player is at y_{t+1}.\n\nSo if we start at turn t1 (which is 3) at y_{3}=3, and we take an action at t1, then at turn t1+1 we are at a new y. We want to be at y=9 at some turn T. The problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nSo we require that at the start of turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). How do we get there?\n\nWe take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2 to determine the position at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut the problem says the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1: meaning a_{t1} (t=0), a_{t1+1} (t=1), ... a_{t1+H-1} (t=H-1). Then the last action is at turn t1+H-1. That action will then determine the position at turn t1+H. \n\nBut we want the position at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). \n\nTherefore, we must have achieved y=9 at turn t1+H-1 without the last action? \n\nActually, the position at turn t1+H-1 is the result of the actions taken at turns t1 to t1+H-2. \n\nBut the sequence includes H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1. \n\nThis seems inconsistent. \n\nLooking again: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning:\n\n  t=0: a_{t1+0} = a_{t1}\n  t=1: a_{t1+1}\n  ...\n  t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd we want the player to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut according to the update rule, the position at time t is determined by the previous actions. Specifically:\n\n  At time t1: we are at (0, y_{t1}=3) and we take a_{t1}. Then we move to (0, y_{t1+1}) at time t1+1.\n\n  At time t1+1: we take a_{t1+1}, then move to (0, y_{t1+2}) at time t1+2.\n\n  ...\n\n  At time t1+H-1: we take a_{t1+H-1}, then we move to (0, y_{t1+H}) at time t1+H.\n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9) at time t1+H-1. That means we must be at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1, before taking the action a_{t1+H-1}. \n\nSo the actions that affect the position at time t1+H-1 are the actions taken at times t1 to t1+H-2.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of actions we take from t1 to t1+H-2 must lead to y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence has H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1. Then the last action (at t1+H-1) is taken when we are already at (0,9)? That doesn't make sense because then we might move away.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we must be at (0,9) at the moment after the last action? But the update rule says the action at t leads to position at t+1.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nAlso, note the collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if ... for any car on freeway y_T\". And we are at (0, y_T) at turn T.\n\nSo the position at turn T is (0, y_T). Therefore, we must be at (0,9) at turn T = t1+H-1.\n\nSo we require y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nHow do we achieve that? We start at turn t1 at y_{t1}=3. Then we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2 (so H-1 actions) to get to y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut the problem asks for a sequence of H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1. That would be one extra action.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal H might be the number of turns from the current turn to the arrival turn? And the sequence of actions is for the turns we are active.\n\nI think the intended meaning is: we are at turn t1, and we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and then at the next turn (t1+H) we are at (0,9)? But the problem says \"reach at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nAnother possibility: the \"turns\" H includes the starting turn? That doesn't make sense.\n\nLooking at the answer format: \n  Turn t1: a_{t1}\n  Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n  ...\n  Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd then after the last action, we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H? But the problem says \"reach at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nI see the confusion. The problem states: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence has H actions. And we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut if we have H actions, then the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then the next state is at turn t1+H. So we are not at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nUnless we are already at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action that might move us? But that action is part of the sequence.\n\nI think the problem means: we start at turn t1 at (0,3). We take an action at turn t1, then at turn t1+1 we are at a new position. We take an action at turn t1+1, and so on, until we take an action at turn t1+H-1, and then after that action we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H. But the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that the entire process takes H turns (including the starting turn) and we are at (0,9) at the last turn of the H turns, which is turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn that case, we start at turn t1 (which is the first turn of the H turns) and end at turn t1+H-1 (the last turn of the H turns) at (0,9).\n\nBut then how many actions? We take an action at each turn from t1 to t1+H-1, so H actions? But then the action at the last turn (t1+H-1) is taken when we are at (0,9) and then it may move us away? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAfter re-thinking, I found a clarification in the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we are to have the player at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis implies that the position at turn t1+H-1 is (0,9). And this position is the result of the actions taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? But the sequence includes an action at t1+H-1.\n\nThere is a known issue in such problems: sometimes the action is taken at the turn and then the position is updated for the next turn. But here the problem says: \"player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\", meaning the action at time t moves the player to y_{t+1} at time t+1.\n\nTherefore, to be at y=9 at time T, we must have that the action at time T-1 moved the player to y=9.\n\nBut the problem says we are to be at turn t1+H-1 at (0,9). So we require y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nHow did we get there? We took actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2 to determine y_{t1+H-1}. Then we also take an action at turn t1+H-1? But that action will determine y_{t1+H}. We don't care about y_{t1+H} as long as we are at y=9 at time t1+H-1.\n\nSo the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is taken when we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9. Then we move to y_{t1+H} = 9 + Delta_{t1+H-1}. But we don't require anything about y_{t1+H} (except that we are done at t1+H-1).\n\nHowever, the action at the last turn might be unnecessary. But the problem requires a sequence of H actions.\n\nSo we must provide H actions, even though the last action doesn't affect the arrival at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis is a bit odd, but we can choose the last action arbitrarily (for example, S) since we are already at 9 and we can stay.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is the minimal number of actions such that after the first H-1 actions, we are at y=9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nAnd then we take the H-th action (at turn t1+H-1) arbitrarily (as long as we don't collide? but note: at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9. And freeway9 doesn't exist? The freeways are only from 1 to 8. The player is at y=9, which is not a freeway? So no car to collide with. So we are safe at y=9.\n\nSo the last action can be any (U, D, S) but we must not go out of bounds: y_{t1+H} must be in [0,9]. Since we are at 9, if we choose U, we would go to 10 which is invalid. Similarly, D would go to 8, which is a freeway but then we are at turn t1+H at y=8, but we don't care about after turn t1+H-1? The collision is only checked at the turn we are on a freeway. Since at turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9 (safe), and then we take an action that moves us to y=8 at turn t1+H. But at turn t1+H, we are at y=8, which is a freeway, and we must check if there is a car at x=0 on freeway8 at turn t1+H. However, the problem only requires us to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. After that, we don't care. But the problem says \"avoid collisions\" during the entire sequence of actions. And the sequence of actions covers turns t1 to t1+H-1. During these turns, we are at positions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nSo at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9 -> safe. The action at turn t1+H-1 will move us to y_{t1+H} at turn t1+H, but that turn is not in the range [t1, t1+H-1]? The collision avoidance is only for the turns in which we are taking actions? Or for the entire path until we reach the goal? \n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars ... during the multi-turn game\". And the goal is to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So we only care about collisions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, the action at turn t1+H-1: even though it will move us to a new position at turn t1+H, that turn is beyond the goal turn. So we don't care about collisions at turn t1+H.\n\nHowever, the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken at turn t1+H-1, and at that turn we are at y=9 (safe), so no collision at that turn. And the move to y_{t1+H} happens after the goal.\n\nTherefore, for the last action, we can choose any action that doesn't cause an out-of-bound at the next state? But the next state is not our concern. We only require that during the actions (t1 to t1+H-1) we are within [0,9] and avoid collisions.\n\nThe player update requires y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and choose U, we would go to 10, which is not allowed. So we cannot choose U at y=9. Similarly, at y=0 we cannot choose D. \n\nSo at the last action (when we are at y=9 at turn t1+H-1), we can only choose D or S. Choosing D would move us to 8 at turn t1+H, but that turn is beyond the goal and we don't care. But the action itself is taken at turn t1+H-1 and we are safe at y=9.\n\nHowever, the problem does not require the next state to be in bounds? It only says \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\". So we must ensure that the action we choose at any state leads to a legal next state.\n\nTherefore, at y=9, we cannot choose U. We can choose S or D.\n\nSimilarly, at y=0, we cannot choose D.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at turn T = t1+H-1 = 3+H-1 = 2+H.\n\nAnd we start at turn 3 at y=3.\n\nSo we have from turn 3 to turn 2+H, and we want to go from y=3 to y=9 in (2+H) - 3 = H-1 steps? The number of state transitions is H-1.\n\nThe minimal number of moves to go from 3 to 9 is 6 moves up. So H-1 = 6 => H=7.\n\nThen the sequence would be 7 actions, and we are at y=9 at turn 3+7-1 = 9.\n\nBut we have to avoid the dangerous turns and freeways.\n\nDangerous situations:\n\n- We must not be on freeway1 at turn 6: so at turn 6, if we are at y=1, then we collide.\n- We must not be on freeways 2,3,4,5 at turns 8 and 9.\n\nWe are to be at turn 9 at y=9.\n\nOur turns: we are at turn 3, then 4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nWe need to assign y for each turn from 3 to 9.\n\nAt turn 3: y=3 (fixed)\nAt turn 9: y=9 (goal)\n\nWe have 6 moves (actions at turns 3,4,5,6,7,8) that will determine the positions at turns 4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nThe net movement must be +6 (from 3 to 9). Each U is +1, D is -1, S is 0.\n\nWe also have constraints:\n\n- At turn 6: y_6 != 1 (because freeway1 is dangerous at turn6)\n- At turn 8: y_8 not in {2,3,4,5} \n- At turn 9: y_9 = 9 (goal)\n\nBut note: at turn 9, we are at y=9, which is safe.\n\nAlso, at turn 8: we require y_8 not in {2,3,4,5}. And at turn 8, if we are in one of these, then we collide because freeways 2-5 are dangerous at turn8.\n\nSimilarly, turn9: we are at 9, so safe.\n\nBut note: the dangerous turns for freeways 2-5 are both 8 and 9. However, at turn9 we are at y=9, so we are not on freeways 2-5. So the only constraint for turn9 is that we are at 9, which is safe. The constraint at turn8 is that we must avoid y in {2,3,4,5}.\n\nAlso, turn6: avoid y=1.\n\nWhat about turn7? There are no dangerous freeways at turn7? Let's check:\n\nWe have only recorded dangers at:\n  turn6: freeway1\n  turn8,9: freeways2-5\n\nAt turn7, is there any danger? The freeways that are dangerous at turn7: \n  freeway1: only at turn6 -> safe at turn7.\n  freeways2-5: dangerous at 8 and 9 -> safe at 7.\n  freeways6-8: always safe.\n\nSo turn7 is safe for any freeway.\n\nWe need to plan a path from y3=3 to y9=9 in 6 moves (actions at turns3,4,5,6,7,8) with the following constraints:\n\n- y6 != 1\n- y8 not in {2,3,4,5}\n\nAlso, we must not go out of bounds.\n\nWe want minimal H, which is the number of actions. Currently, we are assuming H=7 (6 moves to go up 6 steps). But is it possible in 7 turns (actions) to avoid the constraints?\n\nWe must go up 6 steps. So we need at least 6 U actions. But we have 6 actions (from turn3 to turn8) that will give 6 state changes. So we must have exactly 6 U actions? Then the net change is +6. \n\nBut we can also use D or S, but then we would need extra U to compensate, which would require more actions. So to minimize H, we want as few actions as possible, so we want to use only U actions.\n\nLet's try with 6 U actions:\n\nActions: at each turn from 3 to 8: U.\n\nThen the positions:\n\nturn3: y=3\nturn4: y=4 (after U at turn3)\nturn5: y=5\nturn6: y=6 (after U at turn5) -> not 1 -> safe\nturn7: y=7\nturn8: y=8 -> but at turn8, y=8 is freeway8? But freeway8 is safe (always). So no collision.\nturn9: y=9 (after U at turn8)\n\nBut wait, we have a constraint on turn8: we must avoid y in {2,3,4,5} at turn8. Here y8=8, which is not in {2,3,4,5} -> safe.\n\nAnd at turn6: y6=6, not 1 -> safe.\n\nSo this path is safe.\n\nTherefore, we can do it in 6 moves (actions) and then we are at y=9 at turn9. But note: the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 = 3+H-1.\n\nWe are at turn9: 3+H-1 = 9 => H-1=6 => H=7.\n\nSo we need 7 actions: at turns 3,4,5,6,7,8, and also at turn9? But the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, meaning 7 actions: turn3 to turn3+6=9? \n\nThe sequence should be for H=7:\n\n  Turn3: a3\n  Turn4: a4\n  ...\n  Turn9: a9\n\nBut we only need to move up until turn8 to be at y=9 at turn9. The action at turn9 is not necessary for reaching y=9 at turn9? But we are already at y=9 at turn9 (before taking the action at turn9). \n\nThe problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 = 3+7-1=9, we are at (0,9). We are. Then we must provide an action for turn9. We can choose S or D (not U, because at y=9, U would go to 10, invalid).\n\nBut note: the action at turn9 will move us to turn10. We don't care about turn10. But we must choose an action that is valid: so S or D.\n\nWe can choose S (stay) to be safe.\n\nSo the plan:\n\n  Turn3: U -> to y=4 at turn4\n  Turn4: U -> y=5 at turn5\n  Turn5: U -> y=6 at turn6\n  Turn6: U -> y=7 at turn7\n  Turn7: U -> y=8 at turn8\n  Turn8: U -> y=9 at turn9\n  Turn9: S -> stays at y=9 at turn10 (but we don't care)\n\nBut wait, at turn9, we are at y=9 and we take action S, then we stay at y=9 for turn10.\n\nBut the goal is achieved at turn9 (t1+H-1=9).\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt each turn, we are:\n\n  Turn3: y=3 -> freeway3: \n      freeway3: at turn3: span = [-41+6*(3-3), -30+6*0] = [-41,-30] -> doesn't include 0 -> safe.\n\n  Turn4: y=4 -> freeway4: same as freeway3: [-41,-30] at turn4? \n      Actually, freeway4 has the same car: (-30,-41,right,6) -> but wait, the table says for freeway4: same as freeway2,3,5? \n      Actually, the table says:\n        Freeway2: (-30,-41,right,6)\n        Freeway3: (-30,-41,right,6)\n        Freeway4: (-30,-41,right,6)\n        Freeway5: (-30,-41,right,6)\n\n      So freeway4 at turn4: \n          T=4: time difference = 1 -> [-41+6, -30+6] = [-35, -24] -> doesn't include 0 -> safe.\n\n  Turn5: y=5 -> freeway5: at T=5: [-41+6*(5-3)= -41+12= -29, -30+12=-18] -> doesn't include 0.\n\n  Turn6: y=6 -> freeway6: always safe (car never at 0) -> safe.\n\n  Turn7: y=7 -> freeway7: always safe.\n\n  Turn8: y=8 -> freeway8: always safe.\n\n  Turn9: y=9 -> no freeway -> safe.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in H=6? That would mean we are at (0,9) at turn 3+6-1=8.\n\nSo we must be at y=9 at turn8.\n\nWe start at turn3: y=3.\n\nWe need to get to y=9 at turn8, so we have 5 moves (actions at turns3,4,5,6,7) to go from 3 to 9: net +6. So we need 6 up moves in 5 actions? That requires 6 U and -1 other? But we can only do one move per action. \n\nThe net movement is the sum of the Deltas. We need +6 in 5 actions. The maximum we can do is 5 U moves, which is +5, so we can only get to y=8 at turn8. \n\nTherefore, it's impossible to be at y=9 at turn8.\n\nSo minimal H is 7.\n\nBut wait, what about if we use faster moves? We can only move one step per action. So we must have at least 6 U actions. And we have 6 actions from turn3 to turn8 to get to turn9. But to be at y=9 at turn8, we would need to have taken 6 U actions by turn8, meaning the last U at turn7 would put us at y=9 at turn8. Then we would have started at turn3: y=3, then:\n\n  turn3: U -> y4=4\n  turn4: U -> y5=5\n  turn5: U -> y6=6\n  turn6: U -> y7=7\n  turn7: U -> y8=8\n  then we need one more U to get to 9, but we are at turn8: if we do U at turn8, then we get to 9 at turn9.\n\nSo we cannot be at 9 at turn8. \n\nTherefore, H=7 is minimal.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=7.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\n  Turn3: U\n  Turn4: U\n  Turn5: U\n  Turn6: U\n  Turn7: U\n  Turn8: U\n  Turn9: S   (or D, but S is safer as it keeps us at 9)\n\nBut the last action is at turn9, and we are at y=9 at turn9. Then we take S and stay at 9 for turn10.\n\nBut the problem only requires that we are at (0,9) at turn9 (t1+H-1=3+7-1=9). So it's achieved.\n\nHowever, we must check that at turn9, when we are at y=9, we are safe (which we are, no freeway) and then the action S is valid.\n\nAlternatively, we could do:\n\n  Turn9: D -> then at turn10 we go to 8, but we don't care.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify what happens after, we can choose either.\n\nBut to be consistent, we choose S.\n\nSo the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: S\n}\n\nBut wait, the initial state is at turn3, and we are at y=3. The first action is at turn3: U -> moves to y=4 at turn4.\n\nThen we are at turn4: y=4 -> then U to y=5 at turn5, etc.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway1 at turn6: we are at y=6 at turn6 -> safe.\n\nAt turn8: we are at y=8 -> safe.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nBut note: there is a car on freeway3 at turn8? freeway3 is dangerous at turn8. But we are at y=8 at turn8, so we are not on freeway3. We are on freeway8, which is safe.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nTherefore, we output the above.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=7.\n\nBut let me double-check if we can do it in H=6? We concluded we cannot because we need to be at y=9 at turn8 (for H=6, then t1+H-1=3+6-1=8). But to get from y=3 at turn3 to y=9 at turn8, we need 5 moves: 3->4,4->5,5->6,6->7,7->8: then we are at 8 at turn8. We cannot get to 9 in 5 moves: we need 6 moves.\n\nSo H=7 is minimal.\n\nBut note: we might take a detour to avoid a danger? But we don't have any danger in the direct path. And we are already safe. So no need.\n\nBut just to be sure, what if we try to go faster? We can't.\n\nAlternatively, what if we use a down move to avoid a future danger? But in this case, we don't have any danger in our path.\n\nFor example, if we had to avoid being at y=6 at turn6, but we don't.\n\nSo the direct path is safe and minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) is 7. The sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 3, move up (U) to \\(y = 4\\).\n- At turn 4, move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\).\n- At turn 5, move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\).\n- At turn 6, move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\).\n- At turn 7, move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\).\n- At turn 8, move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\).\n- At turn 9, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 9\\) (since \\(y = 9\\) is the goal and no further movement is needed, but an action is required; S is chosen to stay within bounds).\n\nThis sequence avoids collisions with all cars:\n- At turn 3 (\\(y = 3\\)), freeway 3 car span is \\([-41, -30]\\) (no collision).\n- At turn 4 (\\(y = 4\\)), freeway 4 car span is \\([-35, -24]\\) (no collision).\n- At turn 5 (\\(y = 5\\)), freeway 5 car span is \\([-29, -18]\\) (no collision).\n- At turn 6 (\\(y = 6\\)), freeway 6 car span is \\([97, 132]\\) (no collision; always safe).\n- At turn 7 (\\(y = 7\\)), freeway 7 car span is \\([145, 192]\\) (no collision; always safe).\n- At turn 8 (\\(y = 8\\)), freeway 8 car span is \\([193, 240]\\) (no collision; always safe).\n- At turn 9 (\\(y = 9\\)), no freeway exists (safe).\n\nThe goal \\((0, 9)\\) is reached at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 3 + 7 - 1 = 9\\).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 4, and I have the positions and movements of the cars at this turn.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases y by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, each with a head, tail, direction, and speed. Cars move horizontally, and collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, 0 is within the car's span at that turn. The span changes over time based on speed and direction.\n\nImportant point: if the player moves to a new y at turn T, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, they are on y_T, and if they move, at turn T+1 they are on y_{T+1}. So for collision, at turn T, we only care about cars on the freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nThe collision condition is: at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, and 0 is in the span of the car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, let's list the car states at turn t_1 = 4.\n\nFor each freeway k (y=k), we have:\n\n- k=1: head h=-24, tail τ=-35, direction=right, speed=12\n\n- k=2: head h=-24, tail τ=-35, direction=right, speed=6\n\n- k=3: head h=-24, tail τ=-35, direction=right, speed=6\n\n- k=4: head h=-24, tail τ=-35, direction=right, speed=6\n\n- k=5: head h=-24, tail τ=-35, direction=right, speed=6\n\n- k=6: head h=-48, tail τ=-83, direction=right, speed=36\n\n- k=7: head h=-48, tail τ=-95, direction=right, speed=48\n\n- k=8: head h=-48, tail τ=-95, direction=right, speed=48\n\nAll cars are moving right, since direction is \"right\" for all. And they're all moving towards positive x, I assume, since right means increasing x.\n\nIn the span update:\n\nFor left-moving: span moves left, so head decreases.\n\nFor right-moving: span moves right, so head increases.\n\nHere all are right-moving, so for each car, at time T, span is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] for right-moving? Let me check the rule.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\nRight-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car state, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], but it says head and tail, but for right-moving, if it's moving right, the head should be the front, which is at higher x, so if head is h and tail is τ, and it's moving right, then at t_1, the span is from τ to h, with τ < h, since head is front.\n\nIn the state, for k=1, head=-24, tail=-35, and since direction right, and -24 > -35, so head is at higher x, tail at lower x. So span is from τ to h, [τ, h] = [-35, -24] for k=1 at t_1=4.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nThen for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSo the whole span shifts right by s per turn.\n\nCollision if at turn T, player is on freeway y_T, and 0 is in the span for that freeway at T.\n\n0 is the x-coordinate where the player is, since player is at (0, y).\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=4 to y=9 in min turns.\n\ny=9 is the top, which is not a freeway, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is bottom, no cars, but we start from y=4 and go to y=9, so we need to cross the freeways.\n\nSince we start at y=4, which is a freeway, we need to check if at turn t_1=4, we are colliding or not.\n\nAt turn t_1=4, player is at (0,4), so on freeway y=4.\n\nCar on y=4: head h=-24, tail τ=-35, direction right, speed=6.\n\nSpan at T=4: since t_1=4, Span(4) = [τ + s(0), h + s(0)] = [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\n0 is not between -35 and -24? -35 to -24 is all negative, 0 is greater than -24, so 0 not in [-35,-24], so no collision at start. Good.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9. The minimal number of turns would be at least 5, since from y=4 to y=9, that's 5 steps up, so H=5 if we can go straight up without collision.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions at each turn when on freeway y=1 to 8.\n\nSo let's simulate going straight up: all U actions.\n\nStart at turn t=4, y=4.\n\nAction at t=4: U, so y_{5} = 5\n\nAt turn t=5, y=5, which is freeway, need to check collision at t=5.\n\nCar on y=5: at t_1=4, car state: head=-24, tail=-35, speed=6, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-4), h + s(T-4)] for y=5 car.\n\nAt T=5, s=6, T-4=1, so Span(5) = [-35 + 6(1), -24 + 6(1)] = [-29, -18]\n\n0 not in [-29,-18], so safe.\n\nAction at t=5: U, so y_{6} = 6\n\nAt turn t=6, y=6, freeway.\n\nCar on y=6: at t_1=4, head=-48, tail=-83, speed=36, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T=6: [τ + s(T-4), h + s(T-4)] = [-83 + 36(2), -48 + 36(2)] since T-4=2\n\nCalculate: -83 + 72 = -11? -83 + 72 = -11, and -48 + 72 = 24.\n\nSo Span(6) = [-11, 24]\n\nNow, 0 is between -11 and 24? -11 to 24 includes 0, since -11 < 0 < 24, so yes, 0 is in the span.\n\nTherefore, at turn t=6, if player is on y=6, collision occurs.\n\nSo going straight up, at t=6, we collide on y=6.\n\nSo we cannot go straight up; we need to avoid this.\n\nWe might need to wait or go down temporarily to avoid the collision.\n\nSince the car spans move, we can find when 0 is not covered for each freeway.\n\nWe need a sequence of actions from t=4 onwards.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1=4, we need actions starting from a_{t_1} = a_4.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, but here t_1=4, so actions a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_4, a_5, ..., up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and y at turn t_1 + H -1 should be 9.\n\ny_{t} is position after action at t? Let's see.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we perform action a_t, which determines Δy_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nBut the position at turn t is given as (0, y_t), and after action a_t, we move to y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, we consider position (0, y_T), and if y_T between 1 and 8, check if 0 in car span on that freeway at turn T.\n\nIn this case, at turn T, y_T is the row we are on during that turn.\n\nNow for going straight up:\n\n- Turn t=4: position y_4=4, action a_4: U, so y_5=5\n\n- Turn t=5: y_5=5, action a_5: U, so y_6=6\n\n- At t=6: y_6=6, which we saw collision, as span for y=6 car at t=6 is [-11,24], 0 in it.\n\nBut we can choose different actions.\n\nSince from y=4 to y=9, we need to increase y by 5, so minimum H=5 if no obstacles, but with obstacles, H might be more.\n\nWe can go up slower or down to avoid.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each future turn, when 0 is covered by a car.\n\nFor a given freeway k, the car span at time T is [τ_k + s_k (T - 4), h_k + s_k (T - 4)] for right-moving, since all are right.\n\nThen 0 is in the span if τ_k + s_k (T-4) <= 0 <= h_k + s_k (T-4)\n\nSince all cars are moving right, the span is moving right, so 0 will be covered for a certain interval of time.\n\nFor each k, find the time window when 0 is in the span.\n\n0 in span when min(τ + s(T-4), h + s(T-4)) <= 0 <= max, but since τ <= h, min is τ + s(T-4), max is h + s(T-4).\n\nSince moving right, τ + s(T-4) increasing, h + s(T-4) increasing.\n\nSo 0 in span when τ + s(T-4) <= 0 <= h + s(T-4)\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nτ + s(T-4) <= 0 and 0 <= h + s(T-4)\n\nBut since h + s(T-4) > τ + s(T-4), the binding constraints are:\n\nτ + s(T-4) <= 0 <= h + s(T-4)\n\nWhich gives:\n\ns(T-4) <= -τ  and s(T-4) >= -h\n\nFrom τ + s(T-4) <= 0 => s(T-4) <= -τ\n\nFrom 0 <= h + s(T-4) => s(T-4) >= -h\n\nAlso, since T-4 is integer, time steps.\n\nNow for each k:\n\nFirst, k=1: τ=-35, h=-24, s=12, right\n\n0 in span when s(T-4) >= -h and s(T-4) <= -τ\n\ns(T-4) >= -(-24) = 24? Let's compute:\n\ns(T-4) >= -h = -(-24) = 24\n\ns(T-4) <= -τ = -(-35) = 35\n\nSo 12(T-4) >= 24 and 12(T-4) <= 35\n\nDivide: (T-4) >= 24/12 = 2\n\n(T-4) <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so since T integer, (T-4) <= 2? 35/12=2.916, so (T-4) <= 2 since 12*2=24, 12*3=36>35, so (T-4) <= 2? Let's see:\n\ns(T-4) <= 35, 12(T-4) <=35, T-4 <= 35/12 ≈2.916, so T-4 <= 2 since T integer, T-4=0,1,2? T-4=2: 12*2=24 <=35, yes; T-4=3:36>35? 36>35, but s(T-4) <=35, 36>35, so not <=35, so T-4 <=2 because 12*2=24<=35, 12*3=36>35 not <=35.\n\nSimilarly, s(T-4) >=24, 12(T-4) >=24, T-4 >=2.\n\nSo T-4 >=2 and T-4 <=2, so only when T-4=2, i.e., T=6.\n\ns(T-4) >=24 and <=35.\n\nT-4=2: 12*2=24 >=24 and <=35, yes.\n\nT-4=1: 12*1=12 <24, not >=24\n\nT-4=3: 36>35, not <=35\n\nT-4=0:0<24\n\nSo only at T=6, 0 in span for k=1? T-4=2, T=6.\n\nBut k=1 is y=1, freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, for k=2: τ=-35, h=-24, s=6, right\n\ns(T-4) >= -h = -(-24)=24\n\ns(T-4) <= -τ = -(-35)=35\n\nSo 6(T-4) >=24 => T-4 >=4\n\n6(T-4) <=35 => T-4 <=35/6≈5.833, so T-4 <=5\n\nSo T-4 from 4 to 5 inclusive, T=8,9? T-4=4,5\n\nT-4=4: T=8; T-4=5: T=9\n\ns(T-4) >=24: T-4 >=4 since 6*4=24\n\ns(T-4) <=35: T-4 <= floor(35/6)=5 since 6*5=30<=35, 6*6=36>35 not <=35.\n\n35/6=5.833, so T-4 <=5.\n\nSo for k=2, 0 in span when T=8 and T=9.\n\nT-4=4 or 5, T=8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, k=3: same as k=2, since same parameters: τ=-35, h=-24, s=6\n\nSo same as k=2: 0 in span at T=8,9\n\nk=4: also same, τ=-35, h=-24, s=6, so T=8,9\n\nk=5: same, T=8,9\n\nk=6: τ=-83, h=-48, s=36, right\n\ns(T-4) >= -h = -(-48)=48\n\ns(T-4) <= -τ = -(-83)=83\n\nSo 36(T-4) >=48 => T-4 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so T-4 >=2 since integer\n\n36(T-4) <=83 => T-4 <=83/36≈2.305, so T-4 <=2\n\nThus T-4=2, T=6\n\nOnly at T=6.\n\nk=7: τ=-95, h=-48, s=48, right\n\ns(T-4) >= -h = -(-48)=48\n\ns(T-4) <= -τ = -(-95)=95\n\n48(T-4) >=48 => T-4 >=1\n\n48(T-4) <=95 => T-4 <=95/48≈1.979, so T-4 <=1\n\nThus T-4=1, T=5\n\nOnly at T=5.\n\nk=8: τ=-95, h=-48, s=48, same as k=7, so T=5\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, when collision occurs if player is there:\n\n- y=1: collision at T=6\n\n- y=2: collision at T=8,9\n\n- y=3: collision at T=8,9\n\n- y=4: collision at T=8,9\n\n- y=5: collision at T=8,9\n\n- y=6: collision at T=6\n\n- y=7: collision at T=5\n\n- y=8: collision at T=5\n\nAt other times, no collision for that freeway.\n\nFor example, y=1: only unsafe at T=6, safe otherwise.\n\ny=6: only unsafe at T=6, safe otherwise.\n\ny=7 and y=8: unsafe at T=5 only.\n\ny=2,3,4,5: unsafe at T=8 and T=9 only.\n\nNow, player starts at t=4, y=4.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no issue.\n\nThe path must avoid being on a freeway y at turn T when it is unsafe for that y.\n\nNow, since we start at y=4 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, y=4, is it safe? From above, y=4 unsafe only at T=8,9, but t=4 is not 8 or 9, so safe. We checked earlier.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMinimum turns: from y=4 to y=9, need +5 in y, so min H=5.\n\nBut with actions from t=4 to t=8, y from t=4 to t=9? Let's index.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nWe start at t=4, y_4=4.\n\nAfter H actions: a_4, a_5, ..., a_{4+H-1}, we have y_{5}, y_{6}, ..., y_{4+H}\n\nAnd we want y_{4+H} = 9.\n\ny_{4+H} = 9.\n\nSince we start at y_4, after H actions, we are at turn t = 4 + H, position y_{4+H}.\n\nAnd we set y_{4+H} = 9.\n\nThe number of actions is H, from t=4 to t=4+H-1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions at t=4, y_5 = y_4 + Δy_4, set y_5=9, but y_4=4, so Δy=5, impossible, min Δy per step is 1, so H min 5.\n\nIf H=5, actions at t=4,5,6,7,8, then y_9 =9.\n\ny_t for t=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nAt each turn t, we have position y_t, and for t=5 to t=8, if y_t between 1 and 8, need to be safe.\n\ny_9=9, not freeway.\n\nNow for H=5, we need y_t for t=5 to t=8 to be safe when on freeway.\n\ny_t from t=5 to t=8.\n\nt=5,6,7,8.\n\nNow, let's see the unsafe times:\n\nFor each freeway, unsafe at:\n\ny=1: T=6\n\ny=2: T=8,9\n\ny=3: T=8,9\n\ny=4: T=8,9\n\ny=5: T=8,9\n\ny=6: T=6\n\ny=7: T=5\n\ny=8: T=5\n\nT=9 is also unsafe for some, but at t=9, if we are at y=9, not on freeway, so no issue. We only care up to t=8 for positions during the path.\n\ny_t for t=5,6,7,8 need to be safe if on freeway.\n\nt=5: unsafe for y=7 and y=8\n\nt=6: unsafe for y=1 and y=6\n\nt=7: no unsafe? From above, y=2,3,4,5 unsafe at T=8,9, not 7. y=1 unsafe only T=6, y=6 only T=6, y=7 only T=5, y=8 only T=5. So at t=7, all freeways are safe, since no collisions.\n\nt=8: unsafe for y=2,3,4,5 (since T=8)\n\nNow, for H=5, we need y_5, y_6, y_7, y_8 all safe when applicable.\n\ny_4=4.\n\nWe need to choose actions to set y_5, y_6, y_7, y_8.\n\ny_9=9.\n\nSince we need y_9=9, and y_4=4, the sum of Δy from t=4 to t=8 must be +5.\n\nEach action U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\nSo net +5 over 5 actions.\n\nNow, let's see constraints.\n\nAt t=5: if y_5 =7 or 8, unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid y_5=7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly, at t=6: avoid y_6=1 or 6.\n\nAt t=7: no restriction, all safe.\n\nAt t=8: avoid y_8=2,3,4,5.\n\ny_8 cannot be 2,3,4, or 5 because unsafe at t=8.\n\nNow, y_9 must be 9.\n\nPossible values:\n\nStart y_4=4.\n\nAfter a_4, y_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\nΔy_4 depends on a_4: U, D, or S.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSince we need to reach y=9 quickly, probably mostly U, but with adjustments.\n\nNow, at t=5, y_5 cannot be 7 or 8.\n\nPossible y_5: since y_4=4, if a_4=U, y_5=5; a_4=S, y_5=4; a_4=D, y_5=3. Cannot go to 7 or 8 directly from 4, so y_5 can be 3,4,5. None of which are 7 or 8, so t=5 is automatically safe, no matter what. Because from y=4, we can only go to 3,4,5, all not 7 or 8. So no issue at t=5.\n\ny_5 must be between 0 and 9, but 3,4,5 are all safe at t=5 since not 7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly, at t=6, we need to avoid y_6=1 and y_6=6.\n\ny_6 depends on y_5 and a_5.\n\ny_5 is 3,4, or 5.\n\nIf y_5=3, then y_6 could be 2,3,4\n\nIf y_5=4, y_6=3,4,5\n\nIf y_5=5, y_6=4,5,6\n\nWe need to avoid y_6=1 and 6.\n\nIf y_5=3, y_6 can be 2,3,4; none is 1 or 6, so safe.\n\nIf y_5=4, y_6=3,4,5; not 1 or 6, safe.\n\nIf y_5=5, y_6=4,5,6; but y_6=6 is unsafe at t=6, so we must avoid y_6=6 when y_5=5.\n\nBut we can choose a_5 to not go to 6.\n\nNow, at t=7, no restrictions, all safe.\n\nAt t=8, need to avoid y_8=2,3,4,5.\n\ny_8 must not be 2,3,4,5.\n\nSince y_9=9, y_8 must be such that with a_8, we go to 9.\n\nIf y_8=8, a_8=U to 9\n\ny_8=9, a_8=S, but y_9=9, but we need to reach at turn t=9, position y_9=9.\n\nIf y_8=9, a_8=S, then y_9=9, fine.\n\nOr y_8=8, a_8=U, y_9=9.\n\ny_8=9 is possible, but y=9 is not freeway, so at t=8, if y_8=9, no collision since not on freeway.\n\nSimilarly, y_8=10 impossible, max 9.\n\ny_8 can be 7,8,9 to reach y_9=9 with one step.\n\nBut at t=8, we need to avoid y_8=2,3,4,5.\n\nSo y_8 must be 6,7,8, or 9.\n\ny_8=6: if a_8=U, to 7? y_9= y_8 + Δy_8, to reach y_9=9.\n\nIf y_8=6, a_8=U, y_9=7, not 9.\n\nTo reach y_9=9 from y_8, we need y_8 >=8, since if y_8=8, U to 9; y_8=9, S to 9; y_8=7, U to 8, not 9.\n\nWith one action, from y_8 to y_9, to have y_9=9, y_8 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_8=8, a_8=U, y_9=9\n\nIf y_8=9, a_8=S, y_9=9\n\nIf y_8=7, a_8=U, y_9=8 ≠9\n\nSimilarly, y_8=10 impossible.\n\nSo y_8 must be 8 or 9.\n\nBut at t=8, y_8 cannot be 2,3,4,5, which is fine, but y_8 must be 8 or 9, which are not 2-5, so no issue with the avoid, but y_8=8 or 9 is required.\n\nNow, y_8=8 or 9.\n\nAt t=8, if y_8=8, it is a freeway, and we need to check if safe.\n\nBut at t=8, y=8 is unsafe? From above, y=8 unsafe at T=5, not at T=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe only at T=5, as per earlier.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 unsafe only at T=5.\n\nAt t=8, for y=8: from the list, y=8 unsafe only at T=5, so at T=8, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor y=2,3,4,5 unsafe at T=8,9.\n\nBut y=8 not in that list.\n\nSo at t=8, y=8 should be safe, since only unsafe at T=5.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 not freeway.\n\nSo if y_8=8, it is safe at t=8.\n\nIf y_8=9, no issue.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nWe need y_8 to be 8 or 9.\n\nNow, from start, y_4=4.\n\nWe need to get to y_8=8 or 9.\n\nThe difference: from y_4=4 to y_8=8 or 9, that's +4 or +5 in 4 steps? From t=4 to t=8, that's 4 actions: a_4,a_5,a_6,a_7 to set y_8.\n\nThen a_8 to set y_9=9.\n\nFor H=5, we have actions a_4 to a_8, 5 actions.\n\nAfter a_4, y_5; after a_5, y_6; ... after a_8, y_9.\n\nWe need y_9=9.\n\ny_8 must be such that we can reach y_9=9 in one step, so y_8=8 or 9.\n\nNow, the values y_t for t=5,6,7,8 need to be safe.\n\nt=5: we said, since y_5 can only be 3,4,5, all not 7 or 8, so safe.\n\nt=6: need to avoid y_6=1 and y_6=6.\n\nt=7: no restrictions.\n\nt=8: y_8=8 or 9, both safe as above.\n\nNow, y_6 must not be 1 or 6.\n\ny_6 depends on previous.\n\nStart y_4=4.\n\na_4: U, S, or D.\n\nIf a_4=U, y_5=5\n\nIf a_4=S, y_5=4\n\nIf a_4=D, y_5=3\n\nNow, from y_5, a_5.\n\nWe need to consider cases.\n\nFirst, to minimize turns, we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we have constraint at t=6.\n\nAlso, we need to reach high y by t=8.\n\nSince at t=7 no restriction, and t=8 we need y_8=8 or 9.\n\ny_8=8 or 9.\n\nFrom y_4=4, in 4 steps to y_8, we need to increase by 4 or 5.\n\nEach U: +1, so possible with some U and S or D.\n\nBut we want min H, so for H=5, it should be possible if we can avoid the constraints.\n\nNow, let's list possible paths with all U except where we avoid t=6 constraint.\n\nFirst, all U:\n\na_4=U: y_5=5\n\na_5=U: y_6=6\n\nBut at t=6, y_6=6, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nSo cannot have y_6=6.\n\nTherefore, from y_5, if y_5=5, we cannot go to y_6=6, so must not do U if y_5=5.\n\nIf y_5=5, a_5 must not be U, so a_5=S or D, then y_6=5 or 4.\n\nIf y_5=4, a_5=U, y_6=5; a_5=S, y_6=4; a_5=D, y_6=3\n\nIf y_5=3, a_5=U, y_6=4; a_5=S, y_6=3; a_5=D, y_6=2\n\nBut y_6 cannot be 1 or 6.\n\nIf y_5=5, y_6 cannot be 6, so a_5 cannot be U, so y_6=5 (if S) or 4 (if D)\n\nIf y_5=4, y_6 can be 5,4,3; all not 1 or 6, so ok.\n\nIf y_5=3, y_6 can be 4,3,2; not 1 or 6, since y_6=2 is not 1 or 6, 1 is forbidden, 2 is ok.\n\ny_6 cannot be 1 or 6, so 2,3,4,5 are all fine.\n\nOnly 1 and 6 forbidden.\n\nSo for y_5=3, y_6=2,3,4 all fine.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nNow, back to all U attempt failed.\n\nSo we need to not go to y=6 at t=6.\n\nOptions:\n\n- If we start with a_4=S, then y_5=4\n\nThen a_5=U, y_6=5\n\nOr a_5=S, y_6=4\n\nOr a_5=D, y_6=3\n\nAll fine for t=6.\n\nThen from there, we need to reach y_8=8 or 9.\n\ny_6 could be 3,4, or 5 in this case.\n\nThen a_6 and a_7 to get to y_8.\n\nSince t=7 no issue.\n\ny_8 = y_6 + Δy_6 + Δy_7\n\nFor example, if y_6=5, then to y_8, in two steps, can go to y_8=5,6,7 with a_6 and a_7? y_7 = y_6 + Δy_6, y_8 = y_7 + Δy_7.\n\nTo have y_8=8 or 9, from y_6=5, need +3 or +4 in two steps, so possible with U,U to 7, then need another to 8, but y_8 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_6=5, a_6=U, y_7=6; a_7=U, y_8=7; then y_8=7, which is not 8 or 9, so to reach y_9=9, we need a_8=U, y_9=8, not 9, or if a_8=U from 7, y_9=8<9.\n\ny_8=7, a_8=U, y_9=8 ≠9.\n\nWe need y_9=9.\n\nSo if y_8=7, cannot reach 9 in one step.\n\nSimilarly, y_8=6, a_8=U, y_9=7≠9.\n\nOnly y_8=8 or 9.\n\nSo from y_6, we need to reach at least y_8=8.\n\nIn two steps: from y_6, to y_8.\n\ny_8 = y_6 + Δy_6 + Δy_7\n\nΔy_6 and Δy_7 each -1,0,1.\n\nSo max increase 2, so y_8 <= y_6 + 2.\n\nTherefore, to have y_8=8 or 9, we need y_6 >=6, since if y_6=6, y_8<=8; if y_6=7, y_8<=9; if y_6=8, y_8<=10 but max 9, so y_8=8 or 9 possible.\n\ny_6 min? If y_6=5, y_8<=7; y_6=4, y_8<=6; etc.\n\nSo for y_8 to be 8 or 9, we need y_6 >=6.\n\nBecause:\n\n- If y_6=6, y_8 <=8, so y_8=6,7,8. Can be 8 if a_6 and a_7 both U: y_7=7, y_8=8.\n\n- If y_6=7, y_8=6,7,8,9? y_7=y_6 + Δy_6, if y_6=7, a_6=U, y_7=8; a_6=S, y_7=7; a_6=D, y_7=6.\n\nThen y_8: if y_7=8, a_7=U, y_8=9; a_7=S, y_8=8; a_7=D, y_8=7.\n\nSimilarly, if y_7=7, y_8=6,7,8; if y_7=6, y_8=5,6,7.\n\nSo from y_6=7, we can get y_8=8 or 9: e.g., a_6=S, a_7=U: y_7=7, y_8=8; or a_6=U, a_7=S: y_7=8, y_8=8; or a_6=U, a_7=D: y_7=8, y_8=7 not; better: to get y_8=9, need y_7=8 and a_7=S? y_8=y_7 + Δy_7, to have y_8=9, y_7 must be 9 or 8 with U.\n\nIf y_7=8, a_7=U, y_8=9; if y_7=9, a_7=S, y_8=9.\n\nBut from y_6=7, y_7 can be 6,7,8.\n\nSo if y_7=8, then y_8=9 with U; or y_7=9 impossible from y_6=7.\n\ny_6=7 to y_7=8 with U, then y_8=9 with U.\n\nSimilarly, y_8=8 with S from y_7=8.\n\nBut we need y_8=8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, if y_6=8, can get y_8=8 or 9 easily.\n\nBut back to point: to have y_8=8 or 9, we need y_6 >=6.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If y_6=6, can get y_8=8 with two U: y_7=7, y_8=8\n\n- If y_6=7, can get y_8=8 or 9\n\n- If y_6=8, can get y_8=8 or 9\n\nBut y_6=5, y_8 <=7, cannot reach 8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly lower.\n\nSo necessary that y_6 >=6.\n\nBut at t=6, we cannot have y_6=6, because unsafe.\n\ny_6 cannot be 6.\n\nTherefore, y_6 must be 7 or 8? y_6 >=6 but not 6, so y_6 >=7.\n\ny_6 must be at least 7.\n\nBecause if y_6=6, cannot have y_8=8 or 9 since max y_8=8 with two U, but y_6=6 is forbidden at t=6.\n\nSo y_6 must be 7 or 8.\n\nNow, y_6=7 or 8.\n\nNow, from start, y_4=4.\n\ny_6 = y_4 + Δy_4 + Δy_5\n\ny_4=4, y_6 = 4 + Δy_4 + Δy_5\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1, so y_6 between 2 and 6? 4 + (-2) to 4+2, so 2 to 6.\n\nBut we need y_6=7 or 8, which is impossible since max 6.\n\n4 +1 +1=6, min 4-1-1=2.\n\nSo y_6 <=6, cannot be 7 or 8.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, with H=5, it is impossible to have y_8=8 or 9 because y_6 cannot be high enough.\n\nSpecifically, from y_4=4, in two steps to y_6, max y_6=6.\n\nBut y_6=6 is forbidden at t=6, so y_6 <=5.\n\nBut y_6 <=5, then in two more steps to y_8, max y_8=7 (if y_6=5, a_6=U, y_7=6; a_7=U, y_8=7; or if y_6=5, a_6=U, y_7=6; a_7=S, y_8=6; etc, max y_8=7).\n\nIf y_6=5, y_7 <=6, y_8 <=7.\n\nSimilarly, if y_6=4, y_8<=6, etc.\n\nSo y_8 <=7 if y_6 <=5.\n\nBut y_6 <=5 since cannot be 6, so y_8 <=7.\n\nBut we need y_8=8 or 9 for y_9=9 with one action.\n\nImpossible with H=5.\n\nTherefore, H=5 is impossible.\n\nWe need more turns.\n\nMinimal H must be greater than 5.\n\nTry H=6.\n\nWith H=6, we have actions from t=4 to t=9? Let's see.\n\nH actions: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, so for t_1=4, a_4 to a_{4+H-1}, and y_{4+H} =9.\n\nFor H=6, actions a_4 to a_{9}, and y_{10}=9.\n\ny_{10}=9.\n\nThen positions from t=4 to t=9 need to be safe when on freeway.\n\nt=4: y_4=4, safe as before.\n\nt=5: y_5, must be safe.\n\nt=6: y_6, safe\n\nt=7: y_7, safe\n\nt=8: y_8, safe\n\nt=9: y_9, must be safe if on freeway, but y_9 should be 9, not freeway, so no issue.\n\nWe need y_{10}=9.\n\ny_{10} = y_9 + Δy_9\n\nTo have y_{10}=9, y_9 must be 8 or 9, so that with a_9, we can go to 9.\n\nNow, with H=6, we have more flexibility.\n\ny_9 must be 8 or 9.\n\nNow, the critical points.\n\nFirst, from the unsafe times:\n\nAt t=5: avoid y_5=7,8\n\nAt t=6: avoid y_6=1,6\n\nAt t=7: all safe, no restriction\n\nAt t=8: avoid y_8=2,3,4,5\n\nAt t=9: avoid? But y_9 should be 8 or 9, which for y=8, unsafe at T=5, not 9; y=9 not freeway. So at t=9, if y_9=8, it might be unsafe? Let's check.\n\nUnsafe times:\n\nFor y=8, unsafe at T=5 only, as per earlier calculation.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at T=5.\n\ny=2,3,4,5 at T=8,9.\n\nAt t=9, for y=8: since unsafe only T=5, not T=9, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 not freeway.\n\nSo if y_9=8, it is safe at t=9.\n\ny_9=9 safe.\n\nNow, at t=8, avoid y_8=2,3,4,5.\n\ny_8 must not be 2,3,4,5.\n\nBut y_8 can be other values.\n\nNow, we need to reach y_9=8 or 9.\n\nStart y_4=4.\n\nWe have actions a_4 to a_9, but y_{10}=9, so we need to set y_9=8 or 9.\n\nThe path from t=4 to t=9.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up.\n\nBut with constraints.\n\nSince at t=6 we need to avoid y_6=6, and y_6 must be between 0 and 9.\n\nAlso, from y_4, to y_9, in 5 steps? From t=4 to t=9, y_9 = y_4 + sum_{i=4 to 8} Δy_i? y_t to y_{t+1} with Δy_t.\n\ny_9 = y_4 + Δy_4 + Δy_5 + Δy_6 + Δy_7 + Δy_8\n\n5 actions: a_4 to a_8 to set y_9.\n\nThen a_9 to set y_{10}, but we need y_{10}=9, so with a_9.\n\ny_9 must be 8 or 9.\n\nSo net from y_4=4 to y_9=8 or 9, so +4 or +5 in 5 actions, which is easy, min +4 with some S or one D, but we can do all U almost.\n\nBut with constraints.\n\nNow, let's plan the sequence.\n\nStart at t=4, y_4=4.\n\nAt t=5, y_5: cannot be 7 or 8.\n\nFrom y_4=4, y_5 can be 3,4,5. All not 7 or 8, so ok. No restriction effectively.\n\nWe can choose a_4.\n\nTo go up, a_4=U, y_5=5.\n\nOr to stay or down.\n\nBut let's go up.\n\nSet a_4=U, so y_5=5.\n\nNow at t=5, y_5=5, safe.\n\nNow a_5: action at t=5 for y_6.\n\ny_6 must not be 1 or 6.\n\ny_5=5, so y_6 can be 4,5,6.\n\nBut cannot be 6, so a_5 cannot be U, so must be S or D, so y_6=5 or 4.\n\nSay, we do a_5=S, so y_6=5.\n\nThen at t=6, y_6=5, which is not 1 or 6, so safe.\n\nNow, from here, we need to go to y_9=8 or 9.\n\ny_6=5.\n\nNow actions a_6, a_7, a_8 to set y_9.\n\ny_9 = y_6 + Δy_6 + Δy_7 + Δy_8\n\nThree actions, so y_9 <= y_6 + 3 = 8.\n\nMax y_9=8 if all U: y_7=6, y_8=7, y_9=8.\n\nThen with a_9=U, y_{10}=9.\n\ny_9=8, which is ok, then a_9=U to 9.\n\ny_9=8 is freeway, but at t=9, as we said, safe.\n\nNow, we need to check if at each step safe.\n\nNow, y_6=5 at t=6, safe.\n\nNow a_6: at t=6, action a_6 for y_7.\n\nt=7: no restriction, all safe.\n\nSo we can go up.\n\na_6=U, y_7=6.\n\nAt t=7, y_7=6, freeway, need to check safety.\n\ny=6 at t=7: from earlier, y=6 unsafe only at T=6, not at T=7.\n\nSince for y=6, collision only at T=6, so at t=7, safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen a_7=U, y_8=7.\n\nAt t=8, y_8=7, freeway.\n\nNow, at t=8, we need to avoid y_8=2,3,4,5, but y_8=7 not in that, so safe? y=7 unsafe at T=5, not T=8, so safe.\n\nThen a_8=U, y_9=8.\n\nAt t=9, y_9=8, freeway, but unsafe? y=8 unsafe at T=5, not T=9, so safe.\n\nThen a_9=U, y_{10}=9.\n\nNow, we have y_{10}=9, reached.\n\nBut H=6, actions from t=4 to t=9.\n\nSequence: a_4=U, a_5=S, a_6=U, a_7=U, a_8=U, a_9=U\n\nNow, check positions:\n\nt=4: y_4=4, action a_4=U, to y_5=5\n\nt=5: y_5=5, action a_5=S, so y_6=5\n\nt=6: y_6=5, action a_6=U, y_7=6\n\nt=7: y_7=6, action a_7=U, y_8=7\n\nt=8: y_8=7, action a_8=U, y_9=8\n\nt=9: y_9=8, action a_9=U, y_{10}=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt each turn when on freeway:\n\nt=4: y=4, car span [-35,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=5: y=5, car span at t=5: for y=5, τ=-35, h=-24, s=6, T=5, span [-35+6(1), -24+6(1)] = [-29,-18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=6: y=5, car on y=5, same as above? At t=6, T=6, span for y=5: [-35 +6(2), -24+6(2)] = [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=7: y=6, car on y=6: τ=-83, h=-48, s=36, T=7, span [-83 +36(3), -48+36(3)]? T-4=3, since t_1=4.\n\nT=7, T-4=3, span [τ + s(3), h + s(3)] = [-83 + 36*3, -48 + 36*3] = [-83 + 108, -48 + 108] = [25, 60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=8: y=7, car on y=7: τ=-95, h=-48, s=48, T=8, T-4=4, span [-95 + 48*4, -48 + 48*4] = [-95 + 192, -48 + 192] = [97, 144], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=9: y=8, car on y=8: similarly, τ=-95, h=-48, s=48, T=9, T-4=5, span [-95 + 48*5, -48 + 48*5] = [-95 + 240, -48 + 240] = [145, 192], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAnd y_{10}=9, not freeway.\n\nAll safe.\n\nBut is this minimal H? H=6.\n\nEarlier we thought H=5 impossible, so H=6 should be minimal.\n\nBut we used a_5=S, which is a stay, but we reached in 6 turns.\n\nCan we do with fewer? H=5 impossible as shown.\n\nPerhaps another path with H=6 but different.\n\nBut this works.\n\nIn this sequence, we stayed at y=5 for t=5 and t=6? t=5 y=5, t=6 y=5? In above, t=5 y=5, t=6 y=5, then moved up.\n\nBut we could have gone down or something, but not necessary.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster by going up earlier.\n\nFor example, from y_4=4, if we do a_4=D, y_5=3, then a_5=U, y_6=4, but then y_6=4, which is fine, but then we need to go to y_9=8 or 9, from y_6=4, in three steps to y_9, max y_9=7, not enough, since y_9 <= y_6 +3=7, so y_9=7, then to y_{10}=8<9, cannot reach 9 in one step from there. y_{10}= y_9 + Δy_9, if y_9=7, y_{10}=6,7,8, not 9. So must have y_9=8 or 9, so from y_6, need y_6 >=5 to have y_9=8 with three U, but y_6=5, y_9=8 with three U: y_7=6, y_8=7, y_9=8.\n\nThen y_9=8, a_9=U, y_{10}=9.\n\nBut in this case, from y_6=5, same as before.\n\nBut with a_4=D, y_5=3, then to y_6=4 or 5, but y_6 must be at least 5 to reach y_9=8.\n\nIf y_6=5, same as before.\n\nBut in the sequence I have, I have y_6=5 directly.\n\nIn my sequence, with a_4=U, a_5=S, y_6=5.\n\nIf I do a_4=S, y_5=4, then a_5=U, y_6=5, same point.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut I need to avoid y_6=6, which I did by not going up at a_5.\n\nIn t=6, y_6=5 is fine.\n\nThen I go up to y_9=8.\n\nBut in my sequence, I have y_9=8, which requires a_8=U from y_8=7.\n\nBut at t=8, y_8=7, which is safe.\n\nAnother option: perhaps I can reach y_9=9 directly.\n\nBut with y_6=5, max y_9=8, as above.\n\nIf I can get y_6 higher, but earlier we saw y_6 max 6, but 6 forbidden.\n\nSo y_6 <=5.\n\nThus y_9 <=8.\n\nThen I need to go to y_9=8, then to 9.\n\nIn the sequence, with H=6, it works.\n\nPerhaps I can do with H=6 but start moving earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=4, go up to y_5=5.\n\nThen at t=5, instead of stay, go down? But that might not help.\n\na_5=D, y_6=4.\n\nThen y_6=4, at t=6, safe since not 1 or 6.\n\nThen from y_6=4, need to go to y_9=8 or 9.\n\ny_9 = y_6 + Δy_6 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 <=4+3=7, so y_9<=7, cannot reach 8 or 9.\n\nThus impossible to have y_9=8 or 9 from y_6=4.\n\nMust have y_6=5 to have y_9=8.\n\nWith y_6=5, y_9=8 as above.\n\ny_6=5, a_6=U, y_7=6; a_7=U, y_8=7; a_8=U, y_9=8.\n\nThen a_9=U, y_{10}=9.\n\nIn my earlier sequence, I had a_7=U to y_8=7, then a_8=U to y_9=8.\n\nIn the action list for H=6, actions a_4 to a_9.\n\nIn the sequence: a_4=U, a_5=S (to avoid going to 6 at t=6), a_6=U, a_7=U, a_8=U, a_9=U.\n\nWe can write the actions starting from t_1=4.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = a_4\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_5\n\n...\n\nUp to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{4+5} = a_9? H=6, t_1 + H -1 =4+6-1=9.\n\nSo actions from a_4 to a_9.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nBut turn 9 is a_9, which leads to y_{10}=9.\n\nIn the output, it should be the actions.\n\nNow, to confirm, is there a way with H=5? We thought no, but let's see.\n\nSuppose we do not stay, but go down to avoid.\n\nFor example, a_4=D, y_5=3\n\nThen a_5=U, y_6=4\n\nThen a_6=U, y_7=5\n\na_7=U, y_8=6\n\nBut at t=8, y_8=6, but y=6 unsafe at t=8? From earlier, y=6 unsafe only at T=6, not T=8, so safe? But we need y_9, and to reach 9.\n\ny_8=6, a_8=U, y_9=7, not 9. Cannot reach.\n\na_7=U from y_7=5, y_8=6, same.\n\nIf we go faster, but y_6 must avoid 6, so if y_5=3, a_5=U, y_6=4, then a_6=U, y_7=5, a_7=U, y_8=6, a_8=U, y_9=7, then need a_9 to go to 8, but y_{10}=8 if a_9=U, but we need y_{10}=9? With H=5, actions a_4 to a_8, y_9=9? Inconsistency.\n\nFor H=5, actions a_4 to a_8 (since t_1 + H -1 =4+5-1=8), then y_{9} must be 9.\n\ny_9 = y_4 + Δy_4 + ... + Δy_8\n\n5 actions, max y_9=9 if all U: y_5=5, y_6=6, but y_6=6 unsafe at t=6, collision.\n\nIf not all U, say a_4=U, y_5=5; a_5=S, y_6=5; then a_6=U, y_7=6; a_7=U, y_8=7; a_8=U, y_9=8 ≠9.\n\ny_9=8, not 9.\n\nTo get y_9=9, need y_8=8 or 9, but y_8=7 in this case, cannot.\n\nIf we start higher, impossible.\n\na_4=U, y_5=5; a_5=D, y_6=4; then a_6=U, y_7=5; a_7=U, y_8=6; a_8=U, y_9=7<9.\n\nStill not.\n\nThus indeed H=5 impossible.\n\nH=6 is minimal.\n\nIn my sequence, I used one stay, but reached.\n\nPerhaps with no stay, but I need to wait or something.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose at t=4, a_4=S, y_5=4\n\nThen a_5=U, y_6=5 (since cannot go to 6)\n\nThen same as before, y_6=5, then a_6=U, y_7=6; a_7=U, y_8=7; a_8=U, y_9=8; a_9=U, y_{10}=9.\n\nSame as before, but started with S instead of U at t=4.\n\nIn terms of turns, same H=6.\n\nBut in this case, at t=4, we stayed, but position same.\n\nIn my first sequence, I went to 5 at t=5.\n\nBut both work.\n\nI think the sequence is fine.\n\nNow, to output.\n\nThe actions are for turns starting from t_1=4.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nBut turn 9 is the last action.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed.\n\nH=6 turns of actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nSince t_1=4, and H=6.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nAnd that should reach (0,9) at turn 10, but the position after action a_9 is y_{10}=9.\n\nIn the game, after H actions, we reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nt_1=4, H=6, so at turn 10, position (0,9).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, to be thorough, let's check if we can avoid the stay and still do in H=6, but with different actions.\n\nFor example, if at t=5, instead of S, we do D, y_6=4.\n\nThen y_6=4, at t=6 safe.\n\nThen from y_6=4, to reach y_9=8, need to go up fast.\n\na_6=U, y_7=5\n\na_7=U, y_8=6\n\na_8=U, y_9=7\n\nBut y_9=7, not 8 or 9, so to have y_{10}=9, need a_9=U, y_{10}=8<9, not 9. y_{10}=8, not 9.\n\nWith a_8 and a_9, from y_8=6, y_9 <=7, y_{10}<=8, cannot reach 9.\n\nThus not possible.\n\nSo must have y_6=5 to reach y_9=8.\n\nTherefore, the sequence with a_5=S or equivalent is necessary.\n\nThus minimal H=6 with the given sequence.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the box, it should be written as per format.\n\nSince it says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so for t=0, a_{t_1 +0} = a_4, t=1, a_5, up to t=5, a_9.\n\nAnd H=6.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 6. The sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) by ensuring the player avoids all collision points at critical turns, as determined by the car movements and collision conditions.\n\n### Collision Analysis Summary:\n- **Turn 5 (\\(t = 5\\)):** Avoid \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) due to cars on these freeways covering \\(x = 0\\).\n- **Turn 6 (\\(t = 6\\)):** Avoid \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 6\\) due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\).\n- **Turn 7 (\\(t = 7\\)):** All freeways are safe (no cars cover \\(x = 0\\)).\n- **Turn 8 (\\(t = 8\\)):** Avoid \\(y = 2\\), \\(y = 3\\), \\(y = 4\\), and \\(y = 5\\) due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\).\n- **Turn 9 (\\(t = 9\\)):** If the player is at \\(y = 8\\), it is safe (cars do not cover \\(x = 0\\) at this turn); \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway and thus safe.\n\nThe sequence starts at turn 4 with \\(y_4 = 4\\) and ends at turn 10 with \\(y_{10} = 9\\) after 6 actions. The actions are chosen to:\n- Move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 5.\n- Stay at \\(y = 5\\) at turn 6 to avoid collision at \\(y = 6\\).\n- Move up consistently from turn 7 onward to reach \\(y = 9\\) efficiently.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 4 (\\(t = 4\\)):** Action \\(U\\) (move up) → \\(y_5 = 5\\) (safe, not \\(y = 7\\) or \\(8\\)).\n- **Turn 5 (\\(t = 5\\)):** Action \\(S\\) (stay) → \\(y_6 = 5\\) (safe, not \\(y = 1\\) or \\(6\\)).\n- **Turn 6 (\\(t = 6\\)):** Action \\(U\\) (move up) → \\(y_7 = 6\\) (safe, as \\(y = 6\\) is unsafe only at turn 6, but this is turn 7).\n- **Turn 7 (\\(t = 7\\)):** Action \\(U\\) (move up) → \\(y_8 = 7\\) (safe, as \\(y = 7\\) is unsafe only at turn 5).\n- **Turn 8 (\\(t = 8\\)):** Action \\(U\\) (move up) → \\(y_9 = 8\\) (safe, as \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe only at turn 5, and not \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\)).\n- **Turn 9 (\\(t = 9\\)):** Action \\(U\\) (move up) → \\(y_{10} = 9\\) (reached target, not a freeway).\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y_{10} = 9\\) in \\(H = 6\\) turns, which is minimal since \\(H = 5\\) is impossible due to the collision constraint at turn 6 (\\(y = 6\\)) and the inability to reach \\(y = 9\\) in fewer turns while avoiding all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 5, starting at (0,5). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if at that turn we are on a freeway k (which is the y-coordinate) and the car on that freeway has its span covering 0 at turn T.\n\nImportant: When we move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, we are considered to be on y_T at turn T (so we check the car on freeway y_T at turn T) and then we move to y_{T+1} at the next turn. So at turn T, we are on the freeway corresponding to the y-coordinate we have at that turn.\n\nWe can use actions U (up: y increases by 1), D (down: y decreases by 1), or S (stay: y same). We cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe start at y=5 at turn 5. We must avoid the cars on freeways 1 to 8 when we are on that freeway at the same turn.\n\nThe cars are given for freeways 1 to 8 at turn 5. Each car is described by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note that for left-moving, the head is at the leftmost (smaller x) and tail at the rightmost? Actually, the update rule clarifies:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n- Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the representation in the table:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-12, -23, right, 12) -> for right-moving, the initial span at turn 5 is [τ, h] = [-23, -12]? But the table says (head, tail) and then direction. Let me read the table: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\".\n\nSo for freeway 1: head = -12, tail = -23, direction = right, speed = 12.\n\nBut for right-moving, the update rule says: initial span is [τ, h]? That would be [tail, head]? But in the table we have (head, tail) = (-12, -23). So if direction is right, then the initial span at turn5 is [τ, h] = [-23, -12]? But note that the update rule for right-moving: \n  Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut if we have head = -12 and tail = -23, then the car is from -23 to -12? But that would be a car of length 11? And then moving right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, the update rule uses [h, τ] and then subtracts.\n\nSo the key is: the initial span at turn5 for a car is:\n  if right: [tail, head] (and then we add s*(T-t1) to both)\n  if left: [head, tail] (and then we subtract s*(T-t1) from both)\n\nBut wait, the table gives (head, tail) and direction. For right-moving, the head is the front? So if the car is moving right, the front (head) is at a higher x than the tail? But in the example: freeway1: head=-12, tail=-23 -> so tail is at -23 and head at -12, so the car extends from -23 to -12? Then when moving right, the entire car moves to the right.\n\nSo the initial span at turn5 for freeway1 (right) is [tail, head] = [-23, -12]. Then at a future turn T, the span becomes [ -23 + 12*(T-5), -12 + 12*(T-5) ].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway7: (0, -47, right, 48) -> initial span at turn5: [tail, head] = [-47, 0]. Then at turn T: [ -47 + 48*(T-5), 0 + 48*(T-5) ].\n\nNow, we are only concerned when the car's span covers 0 at the turn when we are on that freeway.\n\nWe start at turn5 at y=5. We are not on freeway5 at turn5? We are on freeway5? Actually, freeway k is the y-coordinate. So at turn5, we are at (0,5) so we are on freeway5. We must check if there is a car on freeway5 at turn5 that covers 0.\n\nLet's check freeway5: (-18, -29, right, 6) -> initial span at turn5: [tail, head] = [-29, -18]. So at turn5, the car covers [-29, -18] -> does not cover 0. So safe.\n\nBut we must plan for future turns.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. We can move up, down, or stay. We want minimal H (number of turns) so we want to go up as fast as possible, but we must avoid collisions.\n\nThe collisions occur only when we are on a freeway k at turn T and the car on that freeway at that turn has a span that includes 0.\n\nWe are only concerned with freeways we will be on at the turns we are there.\n\nWe start at turn5 at y=5. Then we choose an action for turn5 that will determine y6.\n\nWe can simulate the moves and the car positions at each turn.\n\nLet t0 = 5.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k and for each turn T>=5, the position of the car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nBut note: the car state is given at turn5, so we can compute for any T.\n\nWe are only concerned when we are on that freeway at that turn.\n\nWe are going to move from y=5 to y=9. The minimal number of turns without any obstacles would be 4 (all U: 5->6->7->8->9). But we must check if that path is safe.\n\nSo let's check the path: \n  Turn5: at y=5 -> check freeway5 at turn5: as above, car at [-29,-18] -> safe.\n  Then we do a_t5 = U -> at turn6 we are at y=6.\n  Turn6: at y=6 -> check freeway6 at turn6: \n      freeway6: (-12, -47, right, 36) -> at turn5: [tail, head] = [-47, -12]\n      at turn6 (T=6, delta=1): [ -47 + 36*(6-5), -12 + 36*(1) ] = [-47+36, -12+36] = [-11, 24] -> does 0 lie in [-11,24]? Yes, because -11<=0<=24. So collision at turn6 on freeway6.\n\nTherefore, we cannot go straight up without stopping or detouring.\n\nWe must avoid that collision. We can either:\n  - Not be on freeway6 at turn6: so we could stay at y=5 for one more turn? Or go down? But going down is away from the goal.\n  - Or we could time our movement so that when we are on freeway6, the car does not cover 0.\n\nBut note the car on freeway6: at turn5: [-47,-12], then turn6: [-11,24], turn7: [ -47+36*2, -12+36*2] = [25, 60] -> then 0 is not in [25,60]. So at turn7, the car is past 0.\n\nSo if we are on freeway6 at turn7, it's safe.\n\nBut how do we get to freeway6 at turn7? We start at turn5 at y=5.\n\nOption: \n  Turn5: S -> stay at y=5 at turn5 (safe) then at turn6 we are still at y=5? Then we can move up at turn6 to y=6 at turn7? Then at turn7 we are at y=6.\n\nSo at turn7, we are on freeway6: check car on freeway6 at turn7: [25,60] -> safe.\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\nBut we need to get to y=9.\n\nLet me write the moves:\n\n  Turn5: S -> stay at y=5 (so at turn5: safe as above; then at turn6 we are still at y=5? Actually, no: at the end of turn5, we are at y5, then at the beginning of turn6 we are at y5? Then we choose an action for turn6.\n\nBut note: the state at turn6: we are at (0,5) at the start of turn6? Or the position at the end of the turn?\n\nThe update: at turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t and then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn5: we start at (0,5). We choose a_5. Then at the end of turn5, we are at y_{6} = y_5 + Δy_5? But the problem says: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\", and we are at (0, y_{t_1}) at the start.\n\nSo at the start of turn5: we are at (0,5). Then we choose a_5. Then at the start of turn6, we are at (0, y6).\n\nTherefore, we are at freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nSo at turn5: we are at freeway5 -> check car on freeway5 at turn5: safe.\n\nAfter choosing a_5, we move to y6 at the start of turn6.\n\nSo if we choose a_5 = S, then y6 = 5. So at turn6, we are at freeway5 -> check car on freeway5 at turn6.\n\nCompute car on freeway5 at turn6: \n  freeway5: (-18, -29, right, 6) -> initial at turn5: [tail, head] = [-29, -18]\n  at turn6: [ -29 + 6*(6-5), -18 + 6*1 ] = [-23, -12] -> does not cover 0 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn6, we choose a_6: if we choose U, then at turn7 we are at y7=6.\n\nAt turn7, we are at freeway6 -> check car on freeway6 at turn7: \n  freeway6: (-12, -47, right, 36) -> at turn7: [ -47 + 36*(7-5), -12 + 36*2 ] = [-47+72, -12+72] = [25,60] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn7, we choose a_7=U -> at turn8 we are at y8=7.\n\nAt turn8, we are at freeway7 -> check car on freeway7 at turn8:\n  freeway7: (0, -47, right, 48) -> at turn8: [ -47 + 48*(8-5), 0 + 48*3 ] = [-47+144, 144] = [97, 144] -> 0 is not in [97,144] -> safe? But wait, the head was 0 at turn5, so at turn8: 0+48*3=144, and tail=-47+144=97? Actually, the update: \n  At turn5: [τ, h] = [-47, 0]\n  At turn8: [ -47 + 48*(3), 0 + 48*3 ] = [ -47+144, 144 ] = [97,144] -> safe.\n\nBut wait, at turn5 the car was at [-47,0]? Then at turn6: [ -47+48, 0+48] = [1,48] -> so at turn6, it covers 0? But we are not on freeway7 at turn6.\n\nAt turn8 we are safe.\n\nThen at turn8, we choose a_8=U -> at turn9 we are at y9=8.\n\nAt turn9, we are at freeway8 -> check car on freeway8 at turn9:\n  freeway8: (0, -47, right, 48) -> same as freeway7? \n      At turn9: [ -47 + 48*(9-5), 0 + 48*4 ] = [-47+192, 192] = [145,192] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn9, we choose a_9=U -> at turn10 we are at y10=9 -> goal.\n\nSo total turns: from turn5 to turn10, that is 5 turns? But note: we are at the start of turn5 at y5, then at the start of turn10 at y9? Actually, we are at y9 at the start of turn10? Then we have taken 5 moves: turns5,6,7,8,9 (5 actions) and then at turn10 we are at y9.\n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9). We are at (0,9) at the start of turn10? Then we have reached at turn10. The minimal H is the number of actions, which is 5? But note the sequence: actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, so H actions? And then we are at the start of turn t1+H at the goal.\n\nWe start at turn5 (t1=5). We take actions at turn5, turn6, ... until we are at y9 at the start of some turn. We need to be at y9 at the start of turn T. Then the number of actions is T - t1 = T-5.\n\nIn the above: we are at y9 at the start of turn10 -> so T=10, then H = T - t1 = 5? But note the problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1, such that at the start of turn t1+H we are at (0,9). \n\nSo if we are at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H, then we have taken H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nIn our plan: \n  Start turn5: y5=5.\n  After H actions, we are at the start of turn5+H at y=9.\n\nIn our case, we are at turn10 (start) at y=9 -> so 5+H = 10 -> H=5.\n\nBut is this minimal? Without obstacles we could do H=4: \n  turn5: U -> y6 at turn6\n  turn6: U -> y7 at turn7\n  turn7: U -> y8 at turn8\n  turn8: U -> y9 at turn9 -> so at the start of turn9 we are at y9 -> H=4.\n\nBut we saw that the direct path has a collision at turn6 on freeway6. So we cannot do 4.\n\nCan we do H=4 in a different way? For example, by going down? But going down would take us away and then we need more moves.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid freeway6 at turn6 by going to freeway7 at turn6? But to get to freeway7 at turn6 we would have to do two ups? But we start at y5, to get to y7 at turn6 we would have to go up twice in one turn? Not possible: one action per turn.\n\nWe can only change by 1 per turn. So we must go through y6 to get to y7.\n\nWe could go up to y6 at a later turn? As we did by waiting one turn.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 4 moves? Let me see:\n\nWe need to be at y9 at turn9 (start). So we must be at y8 at turn8, y7 at turn7, y6 at turn6, and then we start at y5 at turn5.\n\nBut at turn6 we must be at y6 -> then we have to face the car on freeway6 at turn6: which is at [-11,24] -> collision.\n\nUnless we skip freeway6? We cannot: because we must go through each freeway.\n\nWe could go: \n  turn5: U -> y6 at turn6 (collision on freeway6) -> not safe.\n\n  turn5: D -> to y4 at turn6? Then we are at freeway4 at turn6. Check freeway4 at turn6: \n      freeway4: (-18,-29,right,6) -> at turn6: [-29+6, -18+6] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n  Then turn6: U -> to y5 at turn7? Then freeway5 at turn7: \n      freeway5: at turn7: [-29+6*2, -18+6*2] = [-17, -6] -> still doesn't cover 0? safe.\n  Then turn7: U -> to y6 at turn8? Then freeway6 at turn8: \n      freeway6: at turn8: [-47+36*3, -12+36*3] = [-47+108, -12+108] = [61,96] -> safe.\n  Then turn8: U -> to y7 at turn9? \n      freeway7 at turn9: [ -47+48*4, 0+48*4] = [ -47+192, 192] = [145,192] -> safe.\n  Then turn9: U -> to y8 at turn10? \n      freeway8 at turn10: same as freeway7? [ -47+48*5, 0+48*5] = [193,240] -> safe.\n  Then we are at y8 at turn10, but we need to get to y9 -> we need one more move: so at turn10: U -> y9 at turn11.\n\nThat took 6 moves: H=6.\n\nBut our first plan was H=5. So the first plan is better.\n\nBut in the first plan we had:\n  turn5: S -> y5 at turn6\n  turn6: U -> y6 at turn7\n  turn7: U -> y7 at turn8\n  turn8: U -> y8 at turn9\n  turn9: U -> y9 at turn10 -> H=5.\n\nBut we must check all the freeways we are on:\n\nAt turn5: y5=5 -> freeway5: safe (as above)\nAt turn6: we are at y5 (because we did S at turn5) -> freeway5: at turn6: [-23,-12] -> safe.\nAt turn7: we are at y6 (after U at turn6) -> freeway6: at turn7: [25,60] -> safe.\nAt turn8: we are at y7 -> freeway7: at turn8: [97,144] -> safe.\nAt turn9: we are at y8 -> freeway8: at turn9: [145,192] -> safe.\n\nBut wait, we are at y8 at turn9? Then at turn9 we do U -> then at the start of turn10 we are at y9 -> and we don't need to check freeway9? Because there are no cars on freeway9? Actually, the freeways are 1 to 8. So freeway9 is not monitored? Then we are safe.\n\nBut note: we are at y9 at turn10, and we have taken 5 actions: at turns5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut the problem says: we must avoid collisions only on freeways 1 to 8. So when we are on freeway9, there is no car? So safe.\n\nSo that plan works in 5 moves.\n\nCan we do it in 4? We already saw that the direct path has a collision at turn6. \n\nWhat if we go up at turn5 to y6 at turn6? Then we must avoid the collision on freeway6 at turn6. But the car covers 0 at turn6. How can we avoid it? We cannot jump over. We must be at freeway6 at turn6? Unless we skip that freeway? But we can only move one per turn.\n\nAlternatively, we might take a detour: for example, go down first? But that would take more moves.\n\nOr we might try to be at freeway6 at a different turn? But the only way to be at freeway6 is at the turn when we are there. We are at freeway6 at turn6 if we go up at turn5. But then we collide.\n\nSo we must avoid being at freeway6 at turn6. Therefore, we cannot be at freeway6 at turn6. Therefore, we must be at freeway6 at a turn T !=6. \n\nBut to get from y5 to y7 we must pass through y6 at some turn. The next available turn after turn6 is turn7. So if we are at y5 at turn6 (by staying at turn5) then at turn6 we can go to y6 at turn7? Then we are at freeway6 at turn7: which is safe.\n\nSo we have to wait one turn. Therefore, minimal H is 5.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in 4 by a different route? For example, by going up to y6 at turn6, but then immediately going up again at turn6 to y7 at turn7? But we can only do one action per turn. So at turn6 we are at y6 and then we choose an action for turn6 that will set y7. So we are at y6 at turn6 and then we choose U, so at turn7 we are at y7.\n\nBut at turn6 we are at y6 and the car is at [-11,24] -> collision.\n\nAlternatively, can we go up to y6 at turn6 and then down? Then we avoid the collision at turn6? But we are at freeway6 at turn6 -> collision. The collision is at the turn when we are on that freeway, regardless of the next move. So even if we plan to leave immediately, we are still on freeway6 at turn6 and collide.\n\nTherefore, we must not be at freeway6 at turn6.\n\nHence, the minimal H is 5.\n\nBut let me check the other freeways: in our plan we go through:\n\nturn5: y5 -> freeway5: safe at turn5 and turn6 (we are at turn5 and then at turn6 we are still at y5? Actually, at turn6 we are at y5 because we did S at turn5? Then we are at freeway5 at turn6: safe.\n\nThen at turn6 we do U -> so at turn7 we are at y6 -> freeway6 at turn7: safe.\n\nThen at turn7 we do U -> at turn8 we are at y7 -> freeway7: car at turn8: [97,144] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn8 we do U -> at turn9 we are at y8 -> freeway8: at turn9: [145,192] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn9 we do U -> at turn10 we are at y9 -> goal.\n\nBut note: we have to check freeway7 and freeway8 at the turns we are there. What about freeway7 at turn8: the car is [97,144] -> safe. But wait, the car on freeway7: at turn5: [-47,0], at turn8: [ -47+48*3, 0+48*3] = [97,144] -> indeed safe.\n\nBut what about freeway8? same as freeway7? Actually, the table says freeway7 and freeway8 both have the same car: (0, -47, right, 48). So at turn9 for freeway8: [ -47+48*4, 0+48*4] = [145,192] -> safe.\n\nNow, is there any other car that might cause a problem? We are going through freeways 5,5,6,7,8. We don't go through freeway1,2,3,4? But we don't need to because we are not on them. So we only check the freeways we step on.\n\nBut note: at turn5: we are at freeway5 -> safe.\nturn6: freeway5 -> safe.\nturn7: freeway6 -> safe.\nturn8: freeway7 -> safe.\nturn9: freeway8 -> safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway7 at turn8? The car is at [97,144] -> safe. But what if we consider the car on freeway7 at turn5: [ -47,0] -> which does cover 0 at turn5? But we are not on freeway7 at turn5. Similarly, at turn6: freeway7 car at [1,48] -> which covers 0? But we are not on freeway7 at turn6. We are on freeway7 at turn8 -> safe.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut can we do it in 4 moves? We must be at y9 at turn9 (start). So we must be at y8 at turn8? Then we must have been at y7 at turn7, y6 at turn6, and y5 at turn5. But at turn6 we are at y6 and the car on freeway6 at turn6 covers 0 -> collision. \n\nAlternatively, we might skip y6? But we cannot: we start at y5, and we can only move by 1 per turn. So we must go through y6.\n\nTherefore, 5 is minimal.\n\nBut wait, what if we go up twice and then down? That doesn't help.\n\nOr we might go up to y6 at a later time? But then we still have to go through y6, y7, y8, y9. And we have to avoid the car at freeway6 at turn6. So if we go to y6 at turn7, then we are safe. Then we have to do: \n  turn5: S (or D, but D is worse) -> then turn6: U -> turn7: U -> turn8: U -> turn9: U -> that's 4 moves? But wait: \n  turn5: S -> y5 at turn6.\n  turn6: U -> y6 at turn7.\n  turn7: U -> y7 at turn8.\n  turn8: U -> y8 at turn9.\n  turn9: U -> y9 at turn10.\n\nThat's 5 moves: actions at turns5,6,7,8,9 -> H=5.\n\nIf we do nothing at turn5 and then up at turn6, up at turn7, up at turn8, up at turn9: that's 5 actions.\n\nBut note: we are at y5 at turn5. We don't need to do an action at turn5? But we must take an action at every turn. And we are at the same position at turn6 if we do S.\n\nSo we must take 5 actions.\n\nBut what if we do a different sequence? For example, at turn5: U -> to y6 at turn6 -> collision? Then we die. So we cannot.\n\nAt turn5: D -> to y4 at turn6. Then we are safe at freeway4 at turn6. Then we can go up: \n  turn6: U -> to y5 at turn7.\n  turn7: U -> to y6 at turn8.\n  turn8: U -> to y7 at turn9.\n  turn9: U -> to y8 at turn10.\n  turn10: U -> to y9 at turn11. -> 6 moves.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr after going to y4 at turn6, we might go up twice? But we can only do one per turn.\n\nSo minimal is 5.\n\nBut wait, what about freeway7 and freeway8? They have a car that at turn5 is at [ -47,0] -> so at turn5, freeway7: car covers 0? But we are not on freeway7 at turn5. Then at turn6: freeway7 car at [1,48] -> covers 0? But we are not on freeway7 at turn6. Then at turn7: [49,96] -> doesn't cover 0? Actually, at turn6: [ -47+48, 0+48] = [1,48] -> 0 is not in [1,48]? Because 0<1. So it does not cover 0 at turn6? \n\nBut wait: the car covers 0 only if 0 is in the interval. The interval at turn6 for freeway7 is [1,48] -> 0 is not in [1,48]. So actually, at turn6, the car does not cover 0? Then why did we think it did? \n\nWait, no: for freeway7 at turn6: \n  initial at turn5: [τ, h] = [-47, 0] -> because it's right-moving and given (head, tail) = (0, -47)? \n  But the representation: the table says (head, tail) = (0, -47). So head=0, tail=-47. For right-moving, the span is [tail, head] = [-47,0] at turn5.\n  Then at turn6: [ -47+48, 0+48] = [1,48] -> which does not include 0? So safe? \n\nBut earlier I thought freeway6 was the problem. But freeway7 and freeway8 at turn5 and turn6: \n  freeway7 at turn5: [-47,0] -> includes 0? Yes, but we are not on freeway7 at turn5.\n  freeway7 at turn6: [1,48] -> does not include 0.\n\nBut what about freeway6: \n  freeway6: (head, tail) = (-12, -47) -> so for right-moving: [tail, head] = [-47, -12] at turn5.\n  at turn6: [ -47+36, -12+36] = [-11,24] -> which does include 0? Yes.\n\nSo the problem is only freeway6 at turn6.\n\nBut for freeway7: we are safe at turn6? Then why did we have to wait? Because we were going to freeway6 at turn6? \n\nBut if we go up at turn5: then at turn6 we are at freeway6 -> collision.\n\nBut if we go up at turn5 to y6 at turn6, then we are at freeway6 at turn6 -> collision.\n\nBut what if we go up at turn5 to y6 at turn6, but then we are at freeway6 at turn6: collision. So we must avoid that.\n\nBut note: we have freeway7 at turn5: [ -47,0] -> includes 0. But we are at freeway5 at turn5 -> safe. Then if we go up at turn5, we are at freeway6 at turn6 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot go up at turn5.\n\nBut what about freeway8? It's the same as freeway7.\n\nSo the only problem is freeway6 at turn6.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid freeway6 at turn6.\n\nHence, our initial plan of staying at turn5 and then moving up at turn6 is safe and minimal.\n\nBut let me check freeway7 at turn5: if we were to go to freeway7 at turn6? But we start at y5, we can only go to y6 at turn6. Then we are at freeway6 at turn6 -> collision. So we cannot get to freeway7 at turn6.\n\nTherefore, we must take 5 moves.\n\nBut wait, what if we go up at turn5 to y6 at turn6? We die. So we must not.\n\nAlternatively, we might go up at turn5 to y6 at turn6 and then at turn6 we go down? Then at turn7 we are at y5? Then we avoid the collision? But no: at turn6 we are at freeway6 -> collision. The collision is at the turn when we are on the freeway. So even if we leave, we still were there at that turn and collide.\n\nSo we must not be at freeway6 at turn6.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nTurn5: S\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\n\nBut wait: after turn9:U, we are at y9 at turn10. So we have taken 5 actions: turns5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut we start at turn5. So:\n\nTurn t1 (which is 5): a_{5} = S\nTurn t1+1 (6): a_{6} = U\nTurn t1+2 (7): a_{7} = U\nTurn t1+3 (8): a_{8} = U\nTurn t1+4 (9): a_{9} = U\n\nThen at turn10 (t1+5) we are at y9.\n\nSo H=5.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence\". So we output the sequence.\n\nBut let me double-check if there is a shorter path? What if we can go through a freeway that is safe at an earlier time? For example, freeway7: at turn5 it is unsafe (covers 0) but at turn6 it is safe. But we cannot get to freeway7 at turn6: because we start at y5, and to get to y7 we need two moves: \n  turn5: U -> y6 at turn6 (collision on freeway6) -> dead.\n\nAlternatively, we might go down to y4 at turn6? Then at turn6 we are at freeway4: safe. Then we can go up to y5 at turn7: freeway5 at turn7: [-29+6*2, -18+6*2] = [-17,-6] -> safe.\nThen up to y6 at turn8: freeway6 at turn8: [ -47+36*3, -12+36*3] = [61,96] -> safe.\nThen up to y7 at turn9: freeway7 at turn9: [ -47+48*4, 0+48*4] = [145,192] -> safe.\nThen up to y8 at turn10: freeway8 at turn10: [ -47+48*5, 0+48*5] = [193,240] -> safe.\nThen up to y9 at turn11: 6 moves.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the first plan is best.\n\nBut wait, what about freeway1 to freeway4? We are not going through them? But we don't need to. We are only moving up from 5 to 9.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n\nBut the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n}\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that we don't collide on freeway7 and freeway8 at the turns we are there? We are at freeway7 at turn8: which is [ -47+48*3, 0+48*3] = [97,144] -> safe? 0 is not in [97,144] -> safe.\n\nBut note: the car on freeway7 at turn5: [ -47,0] -> includes 0. But we are not on freeway7 at turn5. Similarly, at turn6: [1,48] -> doesn't include 0? Then at turn7: [49,96] -> doesn't include 0? Then at turn8: [97,144] -> safe.\n\nSame for freeway8.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5 and the sequence is as above.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=5.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 4? Suppose we do:\n\n  Turn5: U -> then at turn6 we are at y6 -> collision? So no.\n\nAlternatively, we might try to go to freeway9 earlier? But we start at y5, and we can only move one per turn. To get to y9 we need 4 moves: 5->6->7->8->9, but we must avoid freeway6 at turn6. We cannot avoid being at freeway6 at turn6 if we do U at turn5.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, we are confident.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway5 at turn5: we are safe, and then we do nothing at turn5 (S) -> then we are still at freeway5 at turn6: safe? Then we go up at turn6 to freeway6 at turn7: safe.\n\nBut what if at turn6 we go up, then at turn7 we are at freeway6: safe. Then we go up at turn7 to freeway7 at turn8: safe. Then at turn8 to freeway8 at turn9: safe. Then at turn9 to freeway9 at turn10: goal.\n\nBut we have to do 5 moves.\n\nBut note: we could potentially go faster through the higher freeways? For example, if we could skip some? But we must go through each freeway.\n\nAlternatively, we might do:\n\n  turn5: U -> to y6 at turn6 -> collision? So we die.\n\n  turn5: D -> to y4 at turn6 -> safe? Then at turn6: U -> to y5 at turn7 -> safe? Then at turn7: U -> to y6 at turn8 -> safe (freeway6 at turn8: [61,96])? Then at turn8: U -> to y7 at turn9 -> safe? Then at turn9: U -> to y8 at turn10 -> then we need one more to y9 -> 6 moves.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the answer is 5 moves as above.\n\nBut let me check freeway6 at turn7 again: \n  freeway6: initial at turn5: [ -47, -12] (tail, head) for right-moving.\n  at turn7: T=7, delta=2: [ -47 + 36*2, -12 + 36*2] = [25,60] -> safe.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n\nBut note: after the last action (turn9:U), we are at y9 at the start of turn10. So we have taken 5 actions and reached at turn10.\n\nSo the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says: \"current turn is t_1\", and t_1=5. So we start at turn5.\n\nSo the actions are for turns 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nYes.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) is 5. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by waiting one turn to bypass the collision on freeway 6 at turn 6.\n\n- At turn 5, staying at \\(y = 5\\) (action \\(S\\)) is safe because the car on freeway 5 at turn 5 has span \\([-29, -18]\\), which does not contain 0.\n- At turn 6, moving up to \\(y = 6\\) (action \\(U\\)) would have caused a collision if done at turn 5 (leading to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 6), as the car on freeway 6 at turn 6 has span \\([-11, 24]\\), containing 0. However, by staying at \\(y = 5\\) at turn 5, the player is at \\(y = 5\\) at turn 6, where the car on freeway 5 has span \\([-23, -12]\\), safe.\n- At turn 7, moving up to \\(y = 7\\) (action \\(U\\)) places the player on freeway 6 at turn 7. The car on freeway 6 at turn 7 has span \\([25, 60]\\), which does not contain 0, so it is safe.\n- At turn 8, moving up to \\(y = 8\\) (action \\(U\\)) places the player on freeway 7 at turn 8. The car on freeway 7 at turn 8 has span \\([97, 144]\\), which does not contain 0, so it is safe.\n- At turn 9, moving up to \\(y = 9\\) (action \\(U\\)) places the player on freeway 8 at turn 9. The car on freeway 8 at turn 9 has span \\([145, 192]\\), which does not contain 0, so it is safe. After this action, at the start of turn 10, the player is at \\((0, 9)\\), and since freeway 9 has no cars, the goal is reached safely.\n\nThis sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) because any attempt to reach \\(y = 9\\) in fewer turns (e.g., \\(H = 4\\)) would require being on freeway 6 at turn 6, where a collision occurs. The detour or waiting strategy ensures safety while achieving the goal in minimal turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,5) at turn t1=6 to (0,9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and they move left or right with given speeds. Collision happens if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, the car's span includes 0 at that turn. Importantly, when you move to a new y, you're not on that y until the next turn, so you only check collision for the y you're currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t1=6, and I need to compute their positions at future turns based on their direction and speed.\n\nLet me list all the cars at t1=6:\n\n- Freeway 1 (y=1): head h=0, tail τ=-11, direction right, speed s=12. Since it's right-moving, the span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-11 + 12(T-6), 0 + 12(T-6)]\n\n- Freeway 2 (y=2): head h=-12, tail τ=-23, right, s=6. Span: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-23 + 6(T-6), -12 + 6(T-6)]\n\n- Freeway 3 (y=3): same as y=2, h=-12, τ=-23, right, s=6. Span: [-23 + 6(T-6), -12 + 6(T-6)]\n\n- Freeway 4 (y=4): same as above, h=-12, τ=-23, right, s=6. Span: [-23 + 6(T-6), -12 + 6(T-6)]\n\n- Freeway 5 (y=5): same, h=-12, τ=-23, right, s=6. Span: [-23 + 6(T-6), -12 + 6(T-6)]\n\n- Freeway 6 (y=6): head h=24, tail τ=-11, right, s=36. Span: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-11 + 36(T-6), 24 + 36(T-6)]\n\n- Freeway 7 (y=7): head h=48, tail τ=1, right, s=48. Span: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [1 + 48(T-6), 48 + 48(T-6)]\n\n- Freeway 8 (y=8): same as y=7, h=48, τ=1, right, s=48. Span: [1 + 48(T-6), 48 + 48(T-6)]\n\nt1=6, so T-6 is the number of turns after t1.\n\nCollision on freeway k at turn T if y_T = k and 0 is in the span of the car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe player starts at y=5 at turn t1=6.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is the goal, and there are no cars on y=9, I assume, as freeways are y=1 to 8. y=0 and y=9 might be safe, but y=9 is the target, and y=0 is the bottom, but we start from y=5.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the cars on the way.\n\ny from 5 to 9, so I need to go up through y=6,7,8 to reach 9.\n\nBut there are cars on each of these freeways.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions that gets me to y=9 without being on a freeway when a car spans 0 at that turn.\n\nAlso, since I can stay or move down, but moving down might not be efficient, as I want to go up.\n\nBut sometimes I might need to wait if there's a car blocking.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each freeway and for each turn, whether 0 is in the car's span at that turn, meaning it's dangerous to be on that y at that turn.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, I need to find when the span includes 0.\n\nLet Δt = T - t1 = T - 6, so for turn T, Δt is turns after start.\n\nFor each freeway k, find for which Δt, 0 is in the span at that turn.\n\nStart with freeway 1 (y=1):\n\nSpan at T: [ -11 + 12Δt , 0 + 12Δt ] = [ -11 + 12Δt, 12Δt ]\n\n0 in span if min <= 0 <= max, so -11 + 12Δt <= 0 <= 12Δt\n\nSince it's a closed interval, I assume.\n\nSo, 0 <= 12Δt always true for Δt >=0, since Δt integer >=0.\n\n12Δt >=0 for Δt>=0.\n\nNow, -11 + 12Δt <= 0 ⇒ 12Δt <= 11 ⇒ Δt <= 11/12 < 1, so since Δt integer, Δt <=0? Δt >=0, so -11 +12Δt <=0 only if Δt <= 11/12, which for Δt=0, -11 <=0 true, for Δt=1, -11+12=1>0, not <=0.\n\nLet's solve inequalities:\n\n-11 + 12Δt <= 0 and 0 <= 12Δt\n\n0 <= 12Δt: since Δt >=0, this is always true.\n\n-11 + 12Δt <= 0 ⇒ 12Δt <= 11 ⇒ Δt <= 11/12 ≈ 0.916\n\nSince Δt integer >=0, only Δt=0 satisfies.\n\nAt Δt=0, T=t1=6, span [ -11 +0, 0] = [-11,0], which includes 0? 0 is included, since min <=0<= max.\n\nmin=-11, max=0, so -11 <=0<=0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nFor Δt=1, T=7, span [ -11 +12, 0+12] = [1,12], 1 to 12, 0 not between 1 and 12, so not included.\n\nFor Δt>1, span min increases, so 0 not included.\n\nSo for y=1, dangerous only at Δt=0, T=6.\n\nBut at T=6, player is at y=5, not on y=1, so no collision at start for y=1.\n\nNow freeway 2 (y=2):\n\nSpan at T: [ -23 + 6Δt , -12 + 6Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -23 +6Δt <= 0 <= -12 +6Δt\n\nSo two inequalities:\n\n-23 +6Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -12 +6Δt\n\nFirst: -23 +6Δt <= 0 ⇒ 6Δt <= 23 ⇒ Δt <= 23/6 ≈ 3.833, so Δt <=3\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12 +6Δt ⇒ 6Δt >=12 ⇒ Δt >=2\n\nSo Δt >=2 and Δt <=3, so for Δt=2 and Δt=3.\n\nΔt=2: T=8, span [ -23 +12, -12 +12] = [-11,0]\n\n-11 <=0<=0? min=-11, max=0, so 0 included.\n\nΔt=3: T=9, span [ -23 +18, -12 +18] = [-5,6], -5<=0<=6, yes.\n\nΔt=4: [ -23 +24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not between.\n\nSo for y=2, dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 (y=3): same as y=2, since same parameters.\n\nh=-12, τ=-23, right, s=6, same as y=2.\n\nSo also dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): same, dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): same, dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\ny=5 is where the player is at t1=6.\n\nNow freeway 6 (y=6):\n\nSpan: [ -11 + 36Δt , 24 + 36Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -11 +36Δt <= 0 <= 24 +36Δt\n\nFirst: -11 +36Δt <=0 ⇒ 36Δt <=11 ⇒ Δt <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so only Δt=0 possible? Δt=0: -11 <=0 true, but 0 <= 24 +0 =24 true, so at Δt=0, T=6, span [-11,24], which includes 0.\n\nBut at T=6, player is on y=5, not y=6, so no issue.\n\nFor Δt=1, T=7, span [ -11+36, 24+36] = [25,60], 25 to 60, 0 not in.\n\nSo for y=6, only dangerous at T=6, but player not there.\n\nNow freeway 7 (y=7):\n\nSpan: [1 + 48Δt , 48 + 48Δt]\n\n0 in span: 1 +48Δt <= 0 <= 48 +48Δt\n\nBut 1 +48Δt >=1 >0 for Δt>=0, so min >=1, 0 cannot be <= min, so 0 never in span for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 (y=8): same as y=7, min=1+48Δt >=1>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSo only freeways 2,3,4,5 are dangerous at certain times.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- y=2: dangerous at T=8,9\n\n- y=3: dangerous at T=8,9\n\n- y=4: dangerous at T=8,9\n\n- y=5: dangerous at T=8,9\n\ny=5 is dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut at T=6, player is at y=5, and at that time, for y=5, is it dangerous?\n\nAt T=6, Δt=0, for y=5: span [ -23 +0, -12 +0] = [-23,-12], which is from -23 to -12, so min=-23, max=-12, 0 not between, since -12 <0? -12 <= x <= -12? max=-12, so x <= -12, so 0 > -12, not less than or equal to max? 0 is greater than max, so not in span.\n\nSpan [τ, h] for right-moving, but in this case for y=5, at T=6, span [-23, -12], so numbers from -23 to -12 inclusive? But 0 is not in this range, since -12 < 0.\n\nSimilarly, at T=7, Δt=1, span [-23+6, -12+6] = [-17,-6], still negative, 0 not in.\n\nAt T=8, Δt=2, span [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nT=9, [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nT=10, [1,12], not.\n\nSo for y=5, dangerous only at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, player starts at turn T=6, y=5.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe freeways between: y=6,7,8.\n\ny=6: we saw only dangerous at T=6, but not later.\n\ny=7: never dangerous, as min always >0.\n\ny=8: never dangerous.\n\nBut I have to go through them, but the danger is only from the cars on the freeway I'm on at that turn.\n\nAlso, when I move, I change y at the end of the turn, so for collision, it's based on the y at the start of the turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn and position.\n\nAt turn T, player is at y_T.\n\nThen, based on action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nCollision at turn T if y_T = k and 0 in span of car on k at T.\n\nFor T=6: y=5, and for y=5, at T=6, span is [-23,-12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nNow, I want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe minimal H would be if I can go up every turn.\n\nFrom y=5 to y=9, I need 4 steps up: to y=6,7,8,9.\n\nBut I have to do it in separate turns.\n\nEach up move increases y by 1.\n\nSo in theory, I could be at y=9 in 3 turns? Let's see.\n\nStart T=6, y=5.\n\nAfter action a_6, y_7 = y_6 + Δy.\n\nT=6: position y=5.\n\nAction a_6: if U, y_7=6; if S, y_7=5; if D, y_7=4.\n\nSimilarly, next turn.\n\nTo reach y=9, since y=5 to y=9, difference 4, so at least 4 turns if I go up each time, but I start at turn T=6, and after H turns, I reach at turn T=6 + H -1 or something.\n\nDefine: at turn t1=6, position y=5.\n\nAfter t turns from start, at turn t1 + t, position y_{t1+t}.\n\nSet t=0 at start: turn t1 +0 =6, y=5.\n\nAfter 1 action, turn t1+1=7, y depends on action.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, y_{t1+H} should be 9? No.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so actions at turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAfter action at turn t1+H-1, position at turn (t1+H-1)+1 = t1+H.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nIn terms of turns: at turn T, after action, position for next turn.\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, we use position at start of turn, y_T.\n\nSo for turn T, y_T is position, then action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nThen at turn T+1, position y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nWe start at T=6, y_6=5.\n\nWe want for some H, after H actions (at turns 6 to 6+H-1), position at turn (6+H-1)+1 = 6+H is y_{6+H}=9.\n\nAnd we need to specify actions from turn 6 to turn 6+H-1.\n\nH is the number of actions, so turns from 6 to 6+H-1 inclusive, that's H turns.\n\nThen at turn 6+H, position is set.\n\nBut we need y_{6+H}=9.\n\nSince we start at y=5, to reach y=9, we need a net increase of 4, so if we only go up, H=4 actions: at T=6,7,8,9 actions, then at T=10, y=9.\n\nBut we might have to stay or move down, which could increase H.\n\nMinimal H is at least 4.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, the dangerous times are for y=2,3,4,5 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut y=5 is dangerous at T=8 and T=9, meaning if I am on y=5 at turn T=8 or T=9, I collide.\n\nSimilarly for y=2,3,4.\n\nBut I start at y=5 at T=6, which is safe.\n\nNow, I need to leave y=5 before T=8, because at T=8, if I'm still on y=5, I collide.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be on y=4,3,2 at T=8 or T=9.\n\ny=6,7,8 seem safe except y=6 at T=6, but T=6 is past, and player not on y=6 then.\n\nFor y=6: only dangerous at T=6, which is before we can be there.\n\nAt T=7, y=6 is safe, as span [25,60] not include 0.\n\nSimilarly for later turns.\n\ny=7 and y=8 always safe.\n\nBut I have to go through them.\n\nNow, since y=5 is dangerous at T=8 and T=9, I must not be on y=5 at those turns.\n\nSimilarly, for y=4,3,2, if I were on them at T=8 or T=9, I collide, but since I'm starting from y=5 and going up, I probably won't be on lower y, but I could move down.\n\nBut moving down might not help to reach y=9 faster.\n\nSo let's plan to go up directly.\n\nStart: T=6, y=5, safe.\n\nAction a_6: I can go up to y=6, or stay, or down.\n\nIf I go up, at T=7, y=6.\n\ny=6 at T=7: is it safe? For y=6 at T=7, car span: as above, at T=7, Δt=1, span [25,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at T=7, action a_7: go up to y=8? No, from y=6, if U, y=7; S, y=6; D, y=5.\n\nIf I go up, to y=7 at T=8.\n\nT=8, position y=7.\n\ny=7 at T=8: for freeway y=7, car span at T=8, Δt=2, span [1 +48*2, 48+48*2] = [1+96, 48+96] = [97,144], min=97>0, so safe, no issue.\n\nThen action at T=8: go up to y=8 at T=9.\n\nT=9 position y=8.\n\ny=8 at T=9: similarly, span for y=8 at T=9, Δt=3, [1+48*3, 48+48*3] = [1+144,48+144]=[145,192]>0, safe.\n\nThen action at T=9: go up to y=9 at T=10.\n\nThen y=9 at T=10, which is the goal.\n\nNow, what about the dangerous times? In this sequence:\n\n- T=6: y=5, safe (as we saw)\n\n- T=7: y=6, safe\n\n- T=8: y=7, safe\n\n- T=9: y=8, safe\n\n- T=10: y=9, goal\n\nActions: at T=6: U, to y=6\n\nT=7: U, to y=7\n\nT=8: U, to y=8\n\nT=9: U, to y=9\n\nNow, H=4 actions, from T=6 to T=9.\n\nAt T=9 action, to y=10? No.\n\nTurn T=6: action U, so y_{7} = y_6 +1 =6\n\nT=7: action U, y_8 =7\n\nT=8: action U, y_9=8\n\nT=9: action U, y_{10}=9\n\nAnd at T=10, y=9.\n\nWe need to be at (0,9), which is at turn T=10.\n\nBut is there any collision? Let's check each turn:\n\nT=6: y=5, freeway 5, span at T=6: [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=7: y=6, freeway 6, span at T=7: [-11+36(1), 24+36(1)] = [25,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=8: y=7, freeway 7, span at T=8: [1+48(2),48+48(2)]=[97,144], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=9: y=8, freeway 8, span at T=9: [1+48(3),48+48(3)]=[145,192], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=10: y=9, no freeway, or safe.\n\nBut what about the dangerous times T=8 and T=9 for lower freeways? But I'm not on them, so no issue.\n\nIn this sequence, I was never on y=5 at T=8 or T=9, nor on other dangerous y at dangerous times.\n\nSo this seems to work with H=4.\n\nBut is it minimal? H=4 actions, reaching at turn 10.\n\nCan I do it in fewer?\n\nSuppose I try to reach faster.\n\nFrom y=5 to y=9, I need to increase y by 4.\n\nEach up move increases by 1, so minimum 4 actions if all up.\n\nIf I do down or stay, it takes more actions.\n\nSo H=4 is minimal possible.\n\nBut in this case, it works without any issue.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on y=5.\n\nAt T=6, y=5, safe.\n\nAt T=7, if I were on y=5, what would happen? But in this sequence, I'm at y=6 at T=7.\n\nAt T=7, for y=5: Δt=1, span [-23+6(1), -12+6(1)] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, so actually safe at T=7 for y=5.\n\nOnly dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo going up directly seems fine.\n\nBut the player starts at y=5 at T=6, and I go up at T=6 to y=6 at T=7.\n\nThen to y=7 at T=8, etc.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=8, I'm on y=7, not on y=5 or others.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nI need to output the actions from turn t1=6 onwards.\n\nSo with H=4:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nThen at turn 10, position (0,9).\n\nBut the sequence is for turns from t1 to t1+H-1, so turns 6,7,8,9.\n\nActions: U,U,U,U.\n\nBut is there any reason I need to wait or something?\n\nPerhaps on y=6 or others, but we saw it's safe.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to a new y, I'm not on that y until the next turn, so for example, when I go from y=5 to y=6 at turn T=6, at turn T=6 I'm on y=5, and I move to y=6, but at the moment of moving, during the turn, but the collision is only checked at the start of the turn, based on position at start.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nBut in this case, for the freeway I'm moving to, it doesn't affect, since I'm not on it during the turn.\n\nIn my sequence, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if there is a car at the target freeway at the arrival time, but since I arrive at the next turn, I need to be safe at that turn.\n\nFor example, when I arrive at y=6 at T=7, I need y=6 to be safe at T=7, which it is.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\ny=7 at T=8 is safe, etc.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut let me check if for some reason y=6 is not safe at T=7, but it is.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster? But I can't, since each move changes y by at most 1.\n\nUnless I can jump, but no, only +1, -1, 0.\n\nSo H=4 is minimal.\n\nBut in the car list, freeway 6 has a car with span at t1: head 24, tail -11, right, speed 36.\n\nAt T=7, span [-11+36,24+36]=[25,60], yes.\n\nBut is there a possibility that at some point, when I move, but I think it's fine.\n\nAnother thing: the goal is to reach (0,9), and y=9 has no freeway, so always safe.\n\nBut in the sequence above, I reach at turn 10.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose at T=6, I stay: but then y=5 at T=7, which is safe, as we saw, span at T=7 for y=5 is [-17,-6], no 0.\n\nThen at T=7, go up to y=6 at T=8.\n\nT=8 position y=6.\n\ny=6 at T=8: Δt=2, span [-11+36*2,24+36*2]=[-11+72,24+72]=[61,96], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen action at T=8: go up to y=7 at T=9.\n\nT=9 y=7, safe.\n\nThen T=9 action U to y=8 at T=10.\n\nThen T=10 y=8, then need to go to y=9 at T=11.\n\nThis takes 5 actions: S at T=6, U at T=7, U at T=8, U at T=9, then at T=10 y=8, action U to y=9 at T=11.\n\nH=5, worse.\n\nIf I go up immediately, better.\n\nAt T=6 go down to y=4? Then I have to come back, even worse.\n\nSo direct up is best.\n\nBut in the direct up, with H=4, it works.\n\nBut I think I missed something.\n\nThe player is at (0,5) at turn t1=6.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 5, at t1, car is given, but we are at y=5, and it was safe at T=6.\n\nBut in the sequence, I leave immediately.\n\nBut let me see the dangerous times again.\n\nFor y=5, dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\nIn my sequence, at T=8, I am on y=7, not y=5.\n\nSimilarly at T=9, on y=8.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps for other freeways, but I don't go there.\n\nAnother thing: when I am on y=5 at T=6, and I go up, fine.\n\nBut let me confirm if at T=7, y=6 is safe, yes.\n\nAt T=8, y=7 safe.\n\nAt T=9, y=8 safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut the answer should be minimal H, which is 4.\n\nBut let me see if I can do it in H=3.\n\nSuppose I go up three times: from y=5 to y=6 at T=7, to y=7 at T=8, to y=8 at T=9.\n\nThen at T=9, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need one more up to go to y=9 at T=10.\n\nWith 3 actions, I can be at y=8 at T=9, but not y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, so I need to be at position (0,9) at some turn, which requires y=9 at that turn.\n\nWith actions at T=6,7,8: all U, then at T=9, y=8.\n\nThen I need another action at T=9 to go to y=9 at T=10.\n\nSo minimum 4 actions.\n\nIf I start by staying or down, I end up at lower y, need more up actions.\n\nSo H=4 is minimal.\n\nAnd in this case, it works.\n\nBut in the car list, freeway 6 has a car with head 24, tail -11, at t1.\n\nBut tail -11, which is less than head 24, and direction right, so moving right.\n\nAt T=7, span [25,60], all positive, so 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 7 and 8, cars are at position 1 to 48 at t1, moving right, so at later times, even higher, so 0 never covered.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 4, with actions: U, U, U, U for turns 6,7,8,9.\n\nBut turn 6: a_{t1} = U\n\nTurn 7: a_{t1+1} = U\n\nTurn 8: a_{t1+2} = U\n\nTurn 9: a_{t1+3} = U\n\nThen at turn 10, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so for H=4, t=0,1,2,3, turns t1+0 to t1+3, which is 6 to 9.\n\nActions at those turns.\n\nNow, in the output, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H-1.\n\nSo for H=4:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nAnd that should be it.\n\nBut let me make sure about the collision when moving.\n\nFor example, when I am at T=6, y=5, I take U, so during the turn, I move to y=6, but at the start, I am on y=5, and collision is checked for y=5 at T=6, which is safe.\n\nThen at T=7, I am on y=6, check for y=6 at T=7, safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for y=5 at T=8, but I'm not there.\n\nAnother point: the car on freeway 5 is dangerous at T=8 and T=9, but since I leave early, fine.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, I never visit them at dangerous times.\n\nFor example, y=4 is dangerous at T=8,9, but I never go to y=4.\n\nSo I think it's okay.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is four Up actions.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so I need to write it as such.\n\nAlso, in the box.\n\nBut t1 is 6, so:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nAnd H=4.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose at T=6 I stay, then at T=7 y=5, which is safe, but then at T=7 I go up to y=6 at T=8.\n\nThen at T=8, y=6, which is safe, as span [61,96].\n\nThen go up to y=7 at T=9.\n\nThen at T=9, y=7, safe.\n\nThen need to go to y=8 and y=9, so more actions.\n\nWorse.\n\nIf I go down, even worse.\n\nSo direct up is best.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 faster if I start from higher, but I start at 5.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) is 4. The sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 6, moving up to \\(y = 6\\) avoids collision, as the car on freeway \\(y = 5\\) at turn 6 has span \\([-23, -12]\\), which does not include 0.\n- At turn 7, moving up to \\(y = 7\\) is safe, as the car on freeway \\(y = 6\\) at turn 7 has span \\([25, 60]\\), which does not include 0.\n- At turn 8, moving up to \\(y = 8\\) is safe, as the car on freeway \\(y = 7\\) at turn 8 has span \\([97, 144]\\), which does not include 0.\n- At turn 9, moving up to \\(y = 9\\) is safe, as the car on freeway \\(y = 8\\) at turn 9 has span \\([145, 192]\\), which does not include 0.\n\nThe player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 10. This sequence avoids all dangerous freeways (\\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\)) at turns 8 and 9, where collisions would occur if present.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\end{array} }",

The cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and I'm starting at y=6 at turn t_1=7.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. Each car moves left or right at a constant speed. Since the collision depends on whether the player is on a freeway at a certain turn and if the car's span includes 0 at that turn.\n\nThe player position updates at each turn based on the action: U for up (y increases by 1), D for down (y decreases by 1), S for stay (y stays the same). y is between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9.\n\nNow, the cars: for each freeway, there are cars with head, tail, direction, and speed.\n\nLet me list them out for clarity:\n\nFreeway 1: head=12, tail=1, direction=right, speed=12\n\nSince it's right-moving, the span at turn T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] but t_1 is the current turn, which is 7.\n\nThe car update is given from turn t_1, so at turn T, span is:\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all these seem to be right-moving except I need to check direction.\n\nAll directions are \"right\", so all cars are moving to the right.\n\nFreeway 1: d=right, s=12, head=12, tail=1\n\nAt turn t_1=7, span is [1,12] I think? Head and tail: it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, at t_1, span should be [τ, h] if head is the front.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nIt says: for car on freeway i, at turn t_1, head at h, tail at τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nThen for turn T > t_1, span is:\n\nLeft-moving: span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nRight-moving: span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving, at T, the tail end is τ + s(T-t_1), head is h + s(T-t_1), so span is [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] where ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right here.\n\nAt t_1, for right-moving, the span should be [τ, h], since head is at h, tail at τ, and it's moving right, so tail is left, head is right.\n\nIn the update, at T, it's [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so at ΔT=0, it's [τ, h], yes.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 1 at t_1=7: head=12, tail=1, so span is [1,12].\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway.\n\nThe player is on freeway y at turn T if y_T = y.\n\nAnd collision if 0 ∈ span(T) for that freeway.\n\nAlso, note that when you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you decide action to go to y_{T+1}. But at turn T, you are on y_T, so you check collision based on y_T and the car spans at T.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you only care about cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, if you stay on the same freeway, y_T = y_{T+1}, then at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so you check cars on that freeway at T+1.\n\nBut for collision at turn T, it depends on where you are at that turn.\n\nNow, I need to get to y=9 from y=6.\n\ny=9 is the top, and there are no cars on y=9, since cars are on y=1 to 8. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, no freeways there, so no collision possible on y=0 or y=9.\n\nThe freeways are from y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe zones.\n\nThe problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8\", so on y=0 and y=9, no cars, so no collision.\n\nAlso, when moving, if I go to a different y, I only care about the current y at each turn.\n\nNow, I start at (0,6) at turn t_1=7.\n\nI need to reach (0,9) at some turn, say T, so y_T =9.\n\nMinimize the number of turns H, so the sequence from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1, but since t_1 is given, we start from t_1.\n\nIn the sequence, it's for turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to when we reach y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, so actions from t=0 to H-1, meaning from time t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nLet’s denote the turns starting from t_1.\n\nAt turn T (global time), for T >= t_1.\n\nPlayer position y_T.\n\ny_{t_1} =6.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + K} =9 for some K, and K minimal.\n\nK is the number of turns after start, but since we act at each turn, including t_1, the actions are from t_1 to t_1 + K -1, and at turn t_1 + K, we are at y=9? Let's see the indices.\n\nDefine: at the beginning of turn T, we are at position y_T. Then we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe problem says: \"player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\", where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nAnd collision at turn T if y_T is between 1 and 8, and 0 is in the span of some car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nThe note: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so for collision at T, only y_T matters.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T, you are on y_T, so you check cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, for the cars, we have their state at t_1=7.\n\nFor each freeway, we need to know when 0 is in the car span.\n\nSince the cars are moving, the span changes over time.\n\nFor a given freeway k, at turn T, the span for each car on that freeway, but in this case, each freeway has only one car listed, I think? From the table, it seems one car per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1 has one car, freeway 2 has one, etc., all have one car each.\n\nSo for each freeway k, there is one car with its span moving.\n\nFor freeway k, we need to find for which turns T, 0 is in the span of the car on k at T.\n\nThat is, 0 ∈ [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] for right-moving car.\n\nSince all are right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for left, but all right.\n\nSo the condition is τ + s(T-t_1) <= 0 <= h + s(T-t_1)\n\nBecause span is [left, right] with left <= right.\n\nFor right-moving, span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] with τ + sΔT <= h + sΔT since at ΔT=0, τ <= h, I assume.\n\nIn the description, for right-moving, head h, tail τ, with h > τ I think, since head is front.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 1: at t_1, [1,12], so τ=1, h=12, so τ <= h.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo for each freeway k, at turn T, 0 is in span if:\n\nτ_k + s_k (T - t_1) <= 0 <= h_k + s_k (T - t_1)\n\nWhich means:\n\n0 >= τ_k + s_k (T - t_1) and 0 <= h_k + s_k (T - t_1)\n\nSo:\n\ns_k (T - t_1) <= - τ_k   and   s_k (T - t_1) >= - h_k\n\nFrom τ_k + s_k ΔT <= 0 <= h_k + s_k ΔT\n\nSo:\n\ns_k ΔT <= - τ_k    (since τ_k + s_k ΔT <= 0)\n\nand\n\ns_k ΔT >= - h_k    (since 0 <= h_k + s_k ΔT)\n\nAlso, since s_k > 0, we can divide.\n\nΔT = T - t_1\n\nSo for each k, the times when collision happens on freeway k are when:\n\n- h_k <= s_k ΔT <= - τ_k\n\nFrom above:\n\ns_k ΔT <= - τ_k   and s_k ΔT >= - h_k\n\nSince h_k and τ_k could be negative or positive.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: τ=1, h=12, s=12\n\nSo s_k ΔT >= -h_k = -12\n\ns_k ΔT <= -τ_k = -1\n\nSo 12 ΔT >= -12 and 12 ΔT <= -1\n\nΔT >= -1 and ΔT <= -1/12\n\nSince ΔT >=0, T >= t_1, so ΔT >=0.\n\nΔT >= -1 and ΔT <= -1/12\n\nBut ΔT >=0, so 12 ΔT >=0 > -12, so s_k ΔT >= -h_k is always true for ΔT >=0 since -h_k = -12 <0.\n\ns_k ΔT >= -h_k: -h_k = -12, s_k=12, so 12 ΔT >= -12, so ΔT >= -1, which is true since ΔT >=0.\n\nThen s_k ΔT <= -τ_k = -1, so 12 ΔT <= -1, so ΔT <= -1/12, but ΔT >=0, so this is impossible? -1/12 is negative, so ΔT <= -1/12 <0, but ΔT >=0, so no solution.\n\nThat means for freeway 1, 0 is never in the span? Let's think.\n\nAt t_1, span [1,12], which is all positive, so 0 not in.\n\nAs time increases, s_k ΔT >0, so τ + s ΔT =1 +12ΔT >1 >0, and h + s ΔT=12+12ΔT>12>0, so the whole span is moving right and always positive, so 0 is never in the span. So no collision on freeway 1 at any time. Good.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: τ= -17? Let's see.\n\nFreeway 2: head? The table says: (-6, -17, right, 6)\n\nI think it's (h, τ, d, s), so head h=-6, tail τ=-17, direction right, speed 6.\n\nSince right-moving, at t_1, span is [τ, h] = [-17, -6], so from -17 to -6.\n\nNow at turn T, span [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-17 + 6 ΔT, -6 + 6 ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -17 + 6 ΔT <= 0 <= -6 + 6 ΔT\n\nSo:\n\n-17 + 6 ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= -6 + 6 ΔT\n\nFirst: -17 + 6 ΔT <= 0 => 6 ΔT <= 17 => ΔT <= 17/6 ≈ 2.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -6 + 6 ΔT => 6 ΔT >= 6 => ΔT >=1\n\nSo for ΔT >=1 and ΔT <= 17/6 ≈2.833, so since ΔT integer, ΔT=1,2\n\nBecause ΔT=1: 17/6≈2.833, so ΔT=1,2\n\nΔT=1: -17+6= -11 <=0? -11<=0 true, 0<= -6+6=0, 0<=0 true, so 0 in span.\n\nΔT=2: -17+12= -5 <=0 true, 0<= -6+12=6, 0<=6 true.\n\nΔT=3: -17+18=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, so not <=0, so not in span.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=0: -17 <=0 true but 0 <= -6 false, so not.\n\nSo on freeway 2, collision at ΔT=1 and 2, i.e., T = t_1 +1 =8, and T= t_1 +2=9.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-6, -17, right, 6), identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 3: (-6, -17, right, 6), same as freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same.\n\nFreeway 5: same, all (-6,-17,right,6) for k=2,3,4,5.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5 all have the same car: head=-6, tail=-17, s=6.\n\nSo for each, collision at ΔT=1 and 2.\n\nNow freeway 6: (60,25,right,36)\n\nHead=60, tail=25? But for right-moving, at t_1, span [τ, h] = [25,60]? But head and tail, if head is front, for right-moving, tail should be left, so if head=60, tail=25, then span [25,60].\n\nBut 25 to 60, both positive.\n\nAt T, span [25 + 36 ΔT, 60 + 36 ΔT]\n\n0 in span? 25 +36ΔT >0 always for ΔT>=0, and since min is 25>0, 0 not in span. So no collision on freeway 6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: (96,49,right,48)\n\nSpan at T: [49 +48 ΔT, 96 +48 ΔT] >0, no 0, no collision.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, (96,49,right,48), no collision.\n\nSo only freeways 2,3,4,5 have possible collisions, at ΔT=1 and 2, i.e., T=8 and T=9.\n\nSpecifically, for each of freeway 2,3,4,5, at T=8 and T=9, 0 is in the span, so if the player is on that freeway at T=8 or T=9, collision occurs.\n\nFor other times, no collision on any freeway, since other freeways never have 0 in span.\n\nFreeway 1,6,7,8 no collision ever.\n\nFreeways 2,3,4,5 have collision only at T=8 and T=9.\n\nAt T=7, t_1=7, now at T=7, for freeway 2,3,4,5, span at T=7: [τ + s*0, h + s*0] = [-17,-6] for each, which is negative, so 0 not in span, so no collision at T=7 on any freeway.\n\nNow player starts at T=7, y=6.\n\nFreeway 6 is y=6, I assume freeway k corresponds to y=k.\n\nYes, freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nSo at T=7, player on y=6.\n\nFreeway 6 has no collision at any time, so at T=7, on y=6, no collision.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny from 6 to 9, so we need to increase y by 3.\n\nEach up action increases y by 1, so minimum 3 turns if we go up all the way.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on freeways 2,3,4,5 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nFreeways 2,3,4,5 are y=2,3,4,5.\n\nCollision if on y=2,3,4, or 5 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nAt other times, no issue.\n\nNow, player at T=7, y=6.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nBut D would decrease y, which is away from goal, so probably not useful, since we want to minimize time.\n\nSimilarly, S stays, which might be useful to avoid bad times.\n\nBut let's see the timeline.\n\nT=7: y=6, safe (since freeway 6 no collision)\n\nNow, we choose action a_7 for turn 7, which affects y_8.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, we choose a_8 for y_9, and so on.\n\nWe need to set actions such that we are not on y=2,3,4,5 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nAlso, we need to reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=6, and y=9 is up, we should go up.\n\nBut at T=8, if we are on y=6 or y=7 or etc., but we need to avoid y=2,3,4,5 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSpecifically, at T=8, we must not be on y=2,3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly at T=9, not on y=2,3,4,5.\n\nNow, at T=7, y=6.\n\nAfter action a_7, y_8 = y_7 + Δy_7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPossible y values: 0 to 9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe always.\n\ny=1 to 8 have freeways, but only y=2,3,4,5 have danger at T=8,9.\n\ny=1,6,7,8 are safe at all times, as we saw.\n\nFreeway 1: no collision ever.\n\nFreeway 6: no collision.\n\nFreeway 7: no collision.\n\nFreeway 8: no collision.\n\nOnly y=2,3,4,5 have collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSo at T=8 and T=9, we must not be on y=2,3,4,5.\n\nAt other times, all y are safe, since no other collisions.\n\nNow, we start at T=7, y=6.\n\nWe want to go to y=9.\n\nMinimum steps: from y=6 to y=9, need +3, so at least 3 actions, but we might need to delay if we hit bad times.\n\nBut y=9 is safe, so we can aim to be there quickly.\n\nNow, let's consider the actions.\n\nSuppose we do nothing but U.\n\nThen:\n\nT=7: y=6, safe.\n\na_7 = U, so y_8 = y_7 +1 =7\n\nAt T=8, y=7. Now freeway 7 is safe at all times, so no collision.\n\nThen a_8 = U, y_9 = y_8 +1 =8\n\nAt T=9, y=8, freeway 8 safe.\n\nThen a_9 = U, y_10 =9\n\nBut we reach y=9 at T=10? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, we go to y_{T+1}.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nT=7: y=6\n\na_7=U: y_8=7\n\nT=8: y=7\n\na_8=U: y_9=8\n\nT=9: y=8\n\na_9=U: y_10=9\n\nT=10: y=9, done.\n\nSo at T=10, we are at y=9.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, from t_1 to when we reach.\n\nWe start at t_1=7, and at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9.\n\nIn this case, at T=10, y=9, so t_1 + H -1 =10, t_1=7, so 7 + H -1 =10, so H-1=3, H=4.\n\nActions at t_1, t_1+1, t_1+2.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nHere, actions at T=7,8,9 to reach at T=10.\n\nBut can we reach faster?\n\nFrom y=6 to y=9, minimum 3 steps if we go up each time.\n\nBut at which turn do we arrive.\n\nIf we go up immediately.\n\nAt T=7: y=6\n\na_7=U: y_8=7\n\nT=8: y=7\n\na_8=U: y_9=8\n\nT=9: y=8, not 9 yet.\n\nWe need another action to get to 9.\n\na_9=U: y_10=9, T=10: y=9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at an earlier turn.\n\nBut at T=7, we are at 6, so earliest to be at 9 is T=10, if we go up each turn.\n\ny_8=7, y_9=8, y_10=9.\n\nWe cannot be at y=9 before T=10, because from T=7 y=6, it takes 3 steps to increase to 9.\n\nUnless we start at higher, but we start at 6.\n\nWe could go up faster? But each action changes y by at most 1, so from 6 to 9, minimum 3 actions, so minimum to reach y=9 is at T=10 if we start at T=7 with y=6.\n\nT=7: after action, y_8 could be 5,6,7.\n\nThen T=8: y_8, after action y_9, and so on.\n\nTo have y_T=9, with T as small as possible.\n\nSince y_{t_1} =6, and y increases by at most 1 per turn, the earliest T for y_T=9 is T= t_1 +3 =10.\n\nSimilarly, if we do U all, we reach at T=10.\n\nIn the above sequence, at T=8 and T=9, we were on y=7 and y=8, which are safe, since freeway 7 and 8 no collision.\n\nAnd at T=7, y=6 safe.\n\nSo with H=4 turns? Actions at T=7,8,9, three actions, and at T=10, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=7 to T=9, three actions, reach at T=10.\n\nH is the minimal number of turns, meaning the number of actions taken.\n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H -1, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn this case, with actions at t_1, t_1+1, t_1+2 (three actions), at turn t_1 + 3 -1 = t_1 +2? Let's index properly.\n\nSet t=0 at t_1.\n\nSo actions for t=0 to H-1, at time τ = t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, we are at position after the last action.\n\nAfter action at turn T, we go to y_{T+1}.\n\nAt the start of turn T, we are at y_T, take action a_T, go to y_{T+1}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9? No.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, after action, position is (0,9).\n\nThe position is reached at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, with H=3 actions: at t=0 (t_1), action a_{t_1}, go to y_{t_1 +1}\n\nThen at t=1 (t_1+1), action a_{t_1+1}, go to y_{t_1+2}\n\nThen at t=2 (t_1+2), action a_{t_1+2}, go to y_{t_1+3}\n\nWe want y_{t_1+3} =9.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H -1, after the action, y is 9, so turn number is t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, to reach y=9 at turn t_1 + K for some K.\n\nSince start at y_{t_1}=6, y_{t_1 + K} =9, so K >=3, and K=3 if we increase y each turn.\n\ny_{t_1} =6\n\ny_{t_1 +1} =7 if a_{t_1}=U\n\ny_{t_1 +2} =8 if a_{t_1+1}=U\n\ny_{t_1 +3} =9 if a_{t_1+2}=U\n\nSo at turn t_1 +3, y=9.\n\nNow, the turn when we are at y=9 is t_1 +3.\n\nFor the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, at turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, and at turn t_1 + H -1, after action, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn this case, if we set H=3, then at turn t_1 + 3 -1 = t_1 +2, after action, y should be 9.\n\nBut with actions at t_1 and t_1+1:\n\nAt t_1: action, go to y_{t_1+1}\n\nAt t_1+1: action, go to y_{t_1+2}\n\nWe need y_{t_1+2} =9.\n\nBut from y_{t_1}=6, we can go to y_{t_1+1}=7 (if U), then to y_{t_1+2}=8 (if U), but not to 9 in two steps. Minimum three steps to go from 6 to 9.\n\ny_{t_1 + K} for K=0,1,2,3,...\n\ny_{t_1} =6\n\ny_{t_1+1} =6,7, or 5\n\ny_{t_1+2} =5,6,7,8 or etc., but to be 9, earliest at y_{t_1+3}=9 if all U.\n\nSo we need to reach at turn t_1 +3, so the turn number is t_1 +3.\n\nFor the sequence, H is the number of actions, which is 3, and at turn t_1 + H -1 = t_1 + 3 -1 = t_1 +2, we are not at 9 yet; after the last action at t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +2, we go to y_{t_1 + H} = y_{t_1 +3} =9.\n\nI think I have confusion in indexing.\n\nLet me read the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9)\" means that at some turn, position is (0,9), but in the context, it should be after the sequence of actions.\n\nThe answer format shows actions for turn t_1, t_1+1, etc., and after the last action, we should be at (0,9).\n\nFor example, with actions: turn t_1: U, turn t_1+1: U, turn t_1+2: U, then after that, at turn t_1+3, y=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, the actions are listed for turn t_1, t_1+1, t_1+2, so H=3 actions, and we reach at turn t_1+3.\n\nIn the box, it should be actions for turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nWith H=3, actions at t_1, t_1+1, t_1+2? t from 0 to H-1, so t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor H=3, turns t_1, t_1+1, t_1+2.\n\nAfter action at t_1+2, we go to y_{t_1+3}, which should be 9.\n\nSimilarly, in the collision, we need to ensure that at each turn T from t_1 to t_1+2, when we are at y_T, no collision.\n\nT from t_1 to the turn before we reach, but we need to be safe at all turns until we reach, but when we reach y=9, it's safe, so we need safety during the path.\n\nIn the sequence above, with all U:\n\nAt T=7 (t_1), y=6, safe\n\nAction U, go to y_8=7\n\nAt T=8, y=7, which is freeway 7, safe (no collision)\n\nAction U, go to y_9=8\n\nAt T=9, y=8, freeway 8, safe\n\nAction U, go to y_10=9\n\nThen at T=10, y=9, safe, but we don't care about T=10 since we already reached after the action at T=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at T=7,8,9 (H=3), and after action at T=9, y_10=9, so we reached at turn t_1 + H = t_1 +3.\n\nBut the turn when position is (0,9) is t_1 + H.\n\nBut in the definition, at turn t_1 + H -1, position should be (0,9)? I think I need to clarify.\n\nFrom the answer format, it shows actions for turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and after that, position is (0,9).\n\nSo for example, with actions at turn t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter action at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn the case above, with actions at T=7,8,9, after action at T=9, position is y_10=9.\n\nSo turn t_1 + H -1 =9, so t_1 + H -1 =9, t_1=7, so 7 + H -1 =9, thus H-1=2, H=3.\n\nAnd position after action at T=9 is (0,9).\n\nSimilarly, during the path: at T=7, y=6; T=8, y=7; T=9, y=8, all safe.\n\nNow, but at T=8 and T=9, we have y=7 and y=8, which are safe, but the dangerous freeways are y=2,3,4,5 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nWe are not on them.\n\nSo with H=3, it works.\n\nBut is it minimal H? H=3 is minimum possible since we need to go from 6 to 9, delta=3, each action at most +1, so H=3 is minimum.\n\nWe could reach in H=2? Only if we can jump, but no, actions change y by at most 1, so from 6, after one action, y=5,6,7; after two actions, y=4,5,6,7,8; cannot be 9 in two actions. So H=3 minimum.\n\nThus with all U, we can reach in H=3.\n\nBut in the sequence, at T=8 and T=9, we are on y=7 and y=8, which are fine.\n\nBut the problem is that at T=9, we are on y=8, and we go to y=9 after, but at T=9, we are on freeway 8, which is safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is any problem.\n\nPerhaps we need to output the sequence.\n\nBut the question is, is there a reason to not go directly? For example, if at T=8 or T=9, we were on a dangerous y, but we are not.\n\ny=6 at T=7 safe, y=7 at T=8 safe, y=8 at T=9 safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut freeway 7 and 8 are safe, yes.\n\nPerhaps for y=6, but at T=7, y=6 is safe.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 6 has a car, but we said no collision ever, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's double-check the dangerous times.\n\nCollision only possible on y=2,3,4,5 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nAt other times and other y, no collision.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=6 at T=7, y=7 at T=8, y=8 at T=9, all not dangerous y at those times.\n\nT=7: y=6, safe\n\nT=8: y=7, not 2-5, safe\n\nT=9: y=8, not 2-5, safe\n\nThen after action at T=9, y=9.\n\nSo it seems fine with H=3.\n\nBut why do I feel like there might be an issue? Perhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother thing: the player position is (0,y), and cars are on the freeways, but when y=0 or 9, no freeway, so safe.\n\nIn this case, no problem.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 7 and 8, but we said no collision.\n\nBut let's list the freeways:\n\nFreeway 1: y=1, no collision\n\nFreeway 2: y=2, collision at T=8,9\n\nFreeway 3: y=3, same\n\nFreeway 4: y=4, same\n\nFreeway 5: y=5, same\n\nFreeway 6: y=6, no collision\n\nFreeway 7: y=7, no collision\n\nFreeway 8: y=8, no collision\n\nYes.\n\nAt T=8, if on y=2,3,4,5, collision.\n\nSimilarly T=9.\n\nIn our case, we avoid them.\n\nBut can we reach faster? No, H=3 is minimum.\n\nPerhaps with different actions, but we need to go up.\n\nSuppose we do S at some point, but that would take more turns, H larger, not better.\n\nOr down, worse.\n\nSo minimal H is 3 with all U.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nWe need to output the sequence.\n\nBut the problem is to find minimal H and the sequence.\n\nIn this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nBut perhaps I misread the car states.\n\nFreeway 6: (60,25,right,36), span at T: [25 + 36 ΔT, 60 + 36 ΔT], min at ΔT=0 is 25>0, so 0 never in, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nFreeway 2 to 5: at T=8, ΔT=1, span [-17+6, -6+6] = [-11,0] for each, so 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly T=9, ΔT=2, [-17+12, -6+12] = [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in our path, we are not on y=2,3,4,5 at T=8 or 9.\n\nAt T=8, we are on y=7, safe.\n\nT=9, y=8, safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nThus, the sequence should be:\n\nTurn t_1: U  (a_{t_1} = U)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: U\n\nTurn t_1 +2: U\n\nAnd H=3.\n\nBut t_1=7, so:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nAfter that, at turn 10, y=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions up to turn 9, and after that position is (0,9).\n\nYes.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let's see if there is any constraint I missed.\n\nThe note about moving: if you move to different y at turn T, you are not on the new y at turn T, only on the current y.\n\nBut in this case, when we move from y=6 to y=7 at T=7, at T=7 we are on y=6, then after action, we are on y=7 at T=8.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps for y=9, but we are not on freeway when y=9.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut why is freeway 8 safe? Freeway 8 car: (96,49,right,48), span [49+48ΔT, 96+48ΔT] >0, no 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps the tail and head: for freeway 2, tail=-17, head=-6, which is left of 0, but moving right.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thing: the grid, vertical axis y=0 to 9, but the freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so always safe.\n\nIn the sequence, we don't need to worry about them for collision.\n\nNow, back to the player: we could consider going to y=9 directly, but we are.\n\nPerhaps at T=9, if we are on y=9, but to be on y=9 at T=9, we need y_{t_1+2} =9? Let's see.\n\nIf we want to be at y=9 at an earlier turn, but impossible from start.\n\nFor example, if we start at y=6, earliest at T=10 for y=9, as above.\n\nT=7:6, T=8:7, T=9:8, T=10:9.\n\nWe can be at y=9 at T=10.\n\nBut with actions at T=7,8,9 U U U.\n\nH=3.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence with H=3 but different actions, but U U U is fine.\n\nSuppose we do U at T=7 to y=7, then at T=8, instead of U, we do S, then y=7 at T=8, then at T=9, U to y=8, then we need another action to go to y=9, so H=4, worse.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down, worse.\n\nSo U U U is optimal.\n\nBut is there a problem at T=9? No.\n\nPerhaps the car on freeway 8 or something, but no.\n\nAnother thought: at T=9, if we are on y=8, freeway 8, but it's safe, no collision.\n\nThen we go to y=9.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at T=9, but how?\n\nFrom y=6 at T=7, after one action, y_8=7 at T=8, then after second action, y_9=8 at T=9, cannot be 9 at T=9.\n\nUnless we start higher, but we don't.\n\nSo impossible to reach before T=10.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 3 with actions U,U,U.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbers.\n\nt_1=7.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nAfter action at turn 9, position is (0,9).\n\nAnd during: at turn 7, position (0,6), safe.\n\nTurn 8, position (0,7), safe.\n\nTurn 9, position (0,8), safe.\n\nNo collision.\n\nIf we were to be on y=5 at T=9, for example, it would be dangerous, but we are not.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut perhaps I should write the answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars\", and in this case, no collision.\n\nBut let's see if for freeway 7 or 8, at some time, but no, they never have 0 in span.\n\nFor example, freeway 7: min span 49>0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps the direction: all are right-moving, but for freeway 1, head=12, tail=1, which is fine.\n\nAnother thing: the span includes the endpoints, I assume, since it says [left, right], and 0 in if equal.\n\nIn freeway 2 at T=8, span [-11,0], so 0 is included, so collision if on y=2,3,4,5 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut we avoid.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nThus, minimal H=3, sequence: U at t_1, U at t_1+1, U at t_1+2.\n\nSo for t_1=7:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut the box should contain:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: a_{7}\nTurn 8: a_{8}\nTurn 9: a_{9}\n}\n\nWith a_7=U, a_8=U, a_9=U.\n\nBut it says \"a_{t_1}\" etc., so in the text.\n\nNow, but let's make sure about the car on freeway 6, but it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car state for freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6: (60,25,right,36)\n\nAt T, span [25 + 36 ΔT, 60 + 36 ΔT], both positive, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps for ΔT large, but since we only care about few turns, no.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) only if the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y_T \\leq 8\\)) and the span of a car on that freeway includes 0 at turn \\(T\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Collisions:\n- Cars on freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\) cause collisions at turns \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 9\\) (i.e., \\(\\Delta T = 1\\) and \\(\\Delta T = 2\\) where \\(\\Delta T = T - t_1\\)).\n- All other freeways (\\(y = 1, 6, 7, 8\\)) are safe at all times, as 0 is never in their car spans.\n- Therefore, to avoid collisions, the player must not be on freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\) at turns \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 9\\).\n\n### Player Path to (0, 9):\n- Starting at turn \\(T = 7\\) (i.e., \\(t_1 = 7\\)), the player is at \\(y = 6\\), which is safe.\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\) in minimal turns, the player must increase \\(y\\) by 3. Since each \"U\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1, at least 3 actions are required (minimum \\(H = 3\\)).\n- The sequence of actions must ensure that at turns \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 9\\), the player is not on \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\).\n\n### Optimal Sequence:\n- At turn \\(T = 7\\): Player is at \\(y = 6\\) (safe). Action \\(a_7 = U\\) moves to \\(y_8 = 7\\).\n- At turn \\(T = 8\\): Player is at \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7 is safe). Action \\(a_8 = U\\) moves to \\(y_9 = 8\\).\n- At turn \\(T = 9\\): Player is at \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8 is safe). Action \\(a_9 = U\\) moves to \\(y_{10} = 9\\).\n- After the action at turn \\(T = 9\\), the player reaches (0, 9) at turn \\(T = 10\\).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 3\\) turns (actions at turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 7\\) to \\(9\\)), with no collisions:\n- Turn 7: \\(y = 6\\) (safe, freeway 6 has no collision).\n- Turn 8: \\(y = 7\\) (safe, freeway 7 has no collision and \\(y \\neq 2,3,4,5\\)).\n- Turn 9: \\(y = 8\\) (safe, freeway 8 has no collision and \\(y \\neq 2,3,4,5\\)).\n\nNo shorter sequence is possible, as \\(H = 3\\) is the minimum to increase \\(y\\) from 6 to 9. Alternative actions (e.g., \"S\" or \"D\") would increase \\(H\\) or risk collision, so they are not optimal.\n\n### Answer:\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H = 3\\) with the sequence:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U\n}",

The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway from 1 to 8. For each car, I'm given its position at turn t_1=8, with head h, tail τ, direction d, and speed s. The direction is either right or left, but from the update rules:\n\n- For left-moving cars, the span is [h, τ] and it moves left, so h and τ decrease.\n\n- For right-moving cars, the span is [τ, h] and it moves right, so τ and h increase.\n\nIn the car state table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s). But for right-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" which might be confusing. Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the input, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). But for right-moving, head and tail might be defined differently? Let's see the values.\n\nFor freeway 1: (24, 13, right, 12). Since it's right-moving, Span(t_1) should be [τ, h] = [13, 24]? But it says head=24, tail=13. Probably, head is the front, tail is the back. For right-moving, front is larger, so head > tail. Similarly for left-moving, head < tail.\n\nIn the description: for left-moving, [h, τ] with h decreasing, so if it's moving left, head should be less than tail or something? I need to clarify.\n\nAssume that for any car, head is the position of the front, tail is the back, relative to direction.\n\n- If direction is right, the car is moving right, so head is at higher x, tail at lower x. So at time t, position is from tail to head, with head > tail.\n\n- If direction is left, car moving left, head at lower x, tail at higher x, so head < tail.\n\nIn the span notation:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t) = [tail, head] with head > tail.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t) = [head, tail] with head < tail? No.\n\nFrom the update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] and moves to [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt], so if it's moving left, decreasing x, so head should be on the left, so h < τ? Let's think.\n\nSuppose a car moving left: at t_1, head is at position h, tail at τ, with h and τ such that as it moves left, both decrease. If it's moving left, the front (head) is at smaller x, so for left-moving, head < tail typically.\n\nBut in the input, for freeway 1: (24, 13, right, 12). Since right, moving right, so head at 24, tail at 13, so span is [13,24] I think.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 6: (-48, -83, right, 36). head=-48, tail=-83, but since right-moving, head should be greater than tail? -48 > -83, yes, since -48 is to the right of -83 on the x-axis.\n\nx-axis: more positive is right, more negative is left.\n\nSo for right-moving, head > tail, span [tail, head].\n\nFor left-moving, it would be head < tail, span [head, tail].\n\nBut in this problem, all cars given are right-moving? Let's check.\n\nFreeway 1: (24,13,right,12) → right\n\nFreeway 2: (0,-11,right,6) → right\n\nFreeway 3: (0,-11,right,6) → right\n\nFreeway 4: (0,-11,right,6) → right\n\nFreeway 5: (0,-11,right,6) → right\n\nFreeway 6: (-48,-83,right,36) → head=-48, tail=-83, -48 > -83, so yes, moving right.\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-95,right,48) → similar, -48 > -95\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-95,right,48) → same\n\nAll cars are right-moving. No left-moving cars in this state. That simplifies things.\n\nFor all freeways, cars are right-moving, so at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] for each car.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T at that turn, and 0 is within the span of some car on that freeway at time T.\n\nSpecifically, if at turn T, player is at (0, y_T), and for the car on freeway k=y_T, 0 is in [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)].\n\nPlayer position: at turn T, y_T is the row, and we care about x=0.\n\nThe collision is only considered if the player is on the freeway at that exact turn, and 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nAlso, note that when the player moves to a new row, at the turn they move, they are still on the previous row for collision purposes. From the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo at turn T, when you take action, you are on row y_T during that turn, and collisions are checked based on cars on row y_T at time T.\n\nAfter action, you move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nStart at t_1 = 8, position y=7.\n\nGoal: reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=7, and need to go to y=9, we need to move up twice, so at least two turns if no cars block, but we have to avoid collisions on the way.\n\nThe freeways are from 1 to 8, and we need to go from y=7 to y=9, so we might pass through y=8 or go directly if possible.\n\ny=9 is the goal, but freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 might be safe, no cars there, I assume.\n\nThe collision is only with cars on freeways y=1 to 8, so when at y=9, no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe, but we start at y=7.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=7, the minimal actions would be two U moves, but we need to check if we can do that without colliding.\n\nFirst, we need to see for each freeway, when a car would have 0 in its span.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, for a given freeway k, at time T (relative to t_1=8), the span is [τ + s(T-8), h + s(T-8)] for T >=8.\n\nLet Δt = T - t_1 = T - 8, so for time T, Δt = T-8.\n\nThen span on freeway k at time T: [τ_k + s_k * Δt, h_k + s_k * Δt]\n\n0 is in span if τ_k + s_k * Δt <= 0 <= h_k + s_k * Δt\n\nSince h_k > τ_k for right-moving cars.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we can find the times when 0 is in the span.\n\nBut we care about when the player is on that freeway.\n\nPlayer starts at y=7 at T=8.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nActions: at each turn, choose U, D, or S, changing y accordingly.\n\nTo minimize turns, we probably want to go up as fast as possible, but we might need to wait or detour if cars are blocking.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: head=24, tail=13, dir=right, speed=12\n\nSo at T=8, span = [13,24]? Since right-moving, span is [tail, head] = [13,24]\n\nAt time T, span = [13 + 12*(T-8), 24 + 12*(T-8)]\n\n0 in span if 13 + 12(Δt) <= 0 <= 24 + 12(Δt) where Δt = T-8\n\nSince 13 + 12Δt <= 0 and 0 <= 24 + 12Δt\n\n13 + 12Δt <= 0 => 12Δt <= -13 => Δt <= -13/12 ≈ -1.083, but Δt >=0 since T>=8, so for Δt>=0, 13 + 12Δt >=13>0, so left end is always positive, 0 is never <= left end since left end min is 13 at T=8. So 0 is never in span for freeway 1. No collision possible on freeway 1 at any time.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 24 + 12Δt always true for Δt>=0, but since left end >0, 0 cannot be in span. So freeway 1 is always safe.\n\nNow freeway 2: head=0, tail=-11, dir=right, speed=6\n\nAt T=8, span = [tail, head] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt time T, span = [-11 + 6*(T-8), 0 + 6*(T-8)] = [-11 + 6Δt, 0 + 6Δt] where Δt=T-8\n\n0 in span if -11 + 6Δt <= 0 <= 0 + 6Δt\n\n0 <= 6Δt is always true for Δt>=0? 0 <= 6Δt, which for Δt=0, 0<=0 true, but let's see the inequalities.\n\n0 in span iff min <= 0 <= max, so -11 + 6Δt <= 0 and 0 <= 6Δt\n\nFirst: -11 + 6Δt <= 0 => 6Δt <= 11 => Δt <= 11/6 ≈ 1.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= 6Δt => Δt >= 0\n\nSo for Δt from 0 to 11/6, 0 is in span.\n\nSpecifically, at Δt=0: span [-11,0], 0 is included (since <= max).\n\nSimilarly, at Δt=1: T=9, span [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nAt Δt=2: T=10, span [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12], 1>0, so 0 not <= min? min=1, max=12, 0<1, not in span.\n\nΔt=11/6≈1.833, T=8+1.833=9.833, but turns are integer, so at integer T.\n\nAt T=8: Δt=0, span [-11,0], 0 in span.\n\nT=9: Δt=1, span [-5,6], 0 in span.\n\nT=10: Δt=2, span [1,12], 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, for T<8, but we start from T=8, so for freeway 2, collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? head=0, tail=-11, right, speed=6, so identical to freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same, head=0, tail=-11, right, speed=6.\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nSo freeways 2,3,4,5 all have the same car: at T=8 and T=9, 0 in span, so collision if player on y=2,3,4,5 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nBut player is at y=7 at T=8, not on these, so for now.\n\nFreeway 6: head=-48, tail=-83, dir=right, speed=36\n\nAt T=8, span [tail, head] = [-83, -48]\n\nAt time T, span = [-83 + 36*(T-8), -48 + 36*(T-8)]\n\n0 in span if -83 + 36Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 36Δt\n\nFirst: -83 + 36Δt <= 0 => 36Δt <= 83 => Δt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 36Δt => 36Δt >= 48 => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\nSo Δt >= 1.333 and Δt <= 2.305\n\nInteger T: Δt=2 or Δt=1? Δt=1: T=9, 36*1=36, -83+36=-47, -48+36=-12, span [-47,-12], 0 not in it since -12<0? -12 to -47, all negative, 0 not <= min? min=-47, max=-12, both negative, 0 > max, not in span.\n\nΔt=2: T=10, span [-83 + 72, -48 + 72] = [-11, 24], -11 <=0<=24, yes 0 in span.\n\nΔt=3: T=11, span [-83+108, -48+108] = [25,60], both positive, 0 not in span.\n\nSo only at T=10, Δt=2, 0 in span.\n\nFreeway 7: head=-48, tail=-95, dir=right, speed=48\n\nSpan at T: [-95 + 48*(T-8), -48 + 48*(T-8)]\n\n0 in span if -95 + 48Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 48Δt\n\nFirst: -95 + 48Δt <= 0 => 48Δt <= 95 => Δt <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 48Δt => 48Δt >= 48 => Δt >= 1\n\nSo Δt >=1 and Δt <= 1.979\n\nInteger T: Δt=1 or Δt=2?\n\nΔt=1: T=9, span [-95+48, -48+48] = [-47, 0], -47 <=0<=0, yes 0 in span.\n\nΔt=2: T=10, span [-95+96, -48+96] = [1,48], 1>0, 0 not in span.\n\nSo at T=9, collision on freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7, head=-48, tail=-95, speed=48, so at T=9, collision possible.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway when collision occurs if player is there:\n\n- y=1: never collision\n\n- y=2: collision at T=8 and T=9\n\n- y=3: collision at T=8 and T=9 (since same as y=2)\n\n- y=4: collision at T=8 and T=9\n\n- y=5: collision at T=8 and T=9\n\n- y=6: collision at T=10\n\n- y=7: need to check, but player starts here.\n\nFor y=7, is there a car? In the table, freeway 1 to 8, so y=7 should have a car.\n\nFreeway 7: but freeway 7 is for y=7 row.\n\nIn the table: freeway k, which corresponds to y=k.\n\nSo for y=7, freeway 7: car with head=-48, tail=-95, speed=48.\n\nAt T=8, what is the span?\n\nAt T=8, Δt=0, span = [tail, head] = [-95, -48] for freeway 7.\n\n0 in span? -95 <=0<= -48? But 0 <= -48 is false, since -48<0, so 0 > max, not in span. min=-95, max=-48, both negative, 0 not in [-95,-48].\n\nFrom earlier, collision only at T=9 for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8, freeway 8: same as y=7, collision at T=9.\n\nNow, player starts at T=8, y=7.\n\nAt T=8, on y=7: is there collision? For y=7, car span at T=8: [-95,-48], 0 not in it, so no collision at T=8 on y=7.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 has no freeway, so no cars, always safe.\n\nBut to get to y=9, we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nNow, minimal turns: from y=7, to y=9, we need at least two moves up.\n\nBut we might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's see the immediate actions.\n\nAt T=8, player at y=7. We can choose action for T=8.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, or S.\n\nIf we go U, to y=8 at next turn.\n\nBut at T=8, after action, for collision at T=8, we are on y=7 during the turn.\n\nSince no collision on y=7 at T=8, safe.\n\nThen if we go U, at T=9, we arrive at y=8.\n\nNow, at T=9, on y=8: freeway 8 has car, and at T=9, for y=8, we have collision? Freeway 8 at T=9: as above, for freeway 8, at T=9, Δt=1, span [-95+48, -48+48] = [-47,0] for y=8? Freeway 8 is y=8.\n\nAt T=9, span for y=8: [-47,0], and 0 is in it, since min<=0<=max, -47<=0<=0.\n\nSo if player is on y=8 at T=9, collision.\n\nTherefore, if we move U at T=8, we go to y=8 at T=9, and collide.\n\nIf we stay S at T=8, we remain at y=7 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, on y=7: freeway 7 at T=9, span [-47,0], 0 in it, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to y=6, at T=9 we are on y=6.\n\nAt T=9, on y=6: freeway 6 car, at T=9, Δt=1, span [-83+36, -48+36] = [-47,-12], all negative, 0 not in span, so safe.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9, so going down might not help.\n\nLet's list the danger times for each row:\n\n- y=1: always safe\n\n- y=2: unsafe at T=8,9\n\n- y=3: unsafe at T=8,9\n\n- y=4: unsafe at T=8,9\n\n- y=5: unsafe at T=8,9\n\n- y=6: unsafe at T=10\n\n- y=7: unsafe at T=9 (since at T=8 safe, T=9 unsafe)\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=9 (freeway 8 at T=9 unsafe)\n\ny=8 at T=8: freeway 8 at T=8, span [-95,-48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nBut at T=9 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly y=7 at T=8 safe, T=9 unsafe.\n\nPlayer at T=8, y=7, safe.\n\nNow, actions at T=8:\n\nOption 1: U to y=8 at T=9 → but at T=9 on y=8, collide.\n\nOption 2: S, stay at y=7 at T=9 → at T=9 on y=7, collide.\n\nOption 3: D, to y=6 at T=9 → at T=9 on y=6, which is safe, as above.\n\nSo only safe action at T=8 is D, to y=6 at T=9.\n\nThen at T=9, we are at y=6.\n\nNow at T=9, we need to choose next action.\n\nPosition: y=6 at T=9.\n\nNow actions: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, to y=7 at T=10.\n\nIf D, to y=5 at T=10.\n\nIf S, stay y=6 at T=10.\n\nNow, check collisions.\n\nFirst, at T=10, for y=6: freeway 6, at T=10, Δt=2, span [-83+72, -48+72] = [-11,24], 0 in span, so unsafe at T=10 for y=6.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7 at T=10: freeway 7, at T=10, Δt=2, span [-95+96, -48+96] = [1,48], 1>0, 0 not in span, safe.\n\ny=8 at T=10: freeway 8, similarly [1,48], safe.\n\ny=5 at T=10: freeway 5, at T=10, Δt=2, since freeway 5 has car like y=2,3,4,5 all same.\n\nFor freeway 5: head=0, tail=-11, speed=6, at T=10, Δt=2, span [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12], 1>0, 0 not in span, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=4,3,2 at T=10 all safe since min >0.\n\ny=1 always safe.\n\nBack to T=9, we are at y=6.\n\nAt T=9, during the turn, we are on y=6, which is safe, as established.\n\nNow, we take action for T=9.\n\nIf we go U, to y=7 at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, y=7: as above, freeway 7 span [1,48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nIf we go S, stay at y=6 at T=10, but at T=10, y=6 is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we go D, to y=5 at T=10, y=5 at T=10 is safe, as min=1>0.\n\nBut we want to go up to y=9.\n\nFrom y=6, going U to y=7 at T=10 is good.\n\nThen at T=10, we are at y=7, safe.\n\nNow, from there, we need to go to y=9.\n\nWe can go U to y=8 at T=11, or directly if possible.\n\nAt T=10, position y=7.\n\nTake action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, go to y=8 at T=11.\n\nIf S, stay y=7 at T=11.\n\nIf D, to y=6 at T=11.\n\nNow, check T=11.\n\nAt T=11, for y=7: freeway 7, Δt=3, span [-95+144, -48+144] = [49,96], safe.\n\ny=8: similarly [49,96], safe.\n\ny=6: freeway 6, at T=11, Δt=3, span [-83+108, -48+108] = [25,60], safe.\n\nAll safe at T=11 and later, since all min positions are positive and increasing.\n\nEarlier times: T=10 y=6 unsafe, but we are past that.\n\nSo from T=10 y=7, we can go U to y=8 at T=11.\n\nAt T=11, on y=8, safe.\n\nThen at T=11, we can go U to y=9 at T=12.\n\nAt T=12, we are at y=9, which is goal, and no cars, safe.\n\nSo sequence: let's list turns.\n\nStart T=8, y=7.\n\nAction at T=8: D (to y=6 at T=9)\n\nAt T=9, y=6, action: U (to y=7 at T=10)\n\nAt T=10, y=7, action: U (to y=8 at T=11)\n\nAt T=11, y=8, action: U (to y=9 at T=12)\n\nAt T=12, y=9, done.\n\nH=4 turns? From T=8 to T=11 actions, arrive at T=12.\n\nTurns: actions at T=8, T=9, T=10, T=11, four actions, arrive at y=9 at T=12.\n\nMinimal? Is there a shorter way?\n\nWithout cars, we could go U at T=8 to y=8 at T=9, but collide at T=9.\n\nOr S at T=8, stay y=7 at T=9, collide.\n\nSo we had to go down.\n\nCould we go down to a lower row earlier?\n\nFor example, at T=8, we go D to y=6 at T=9.\n\nThen at T=9, instead of U, we could go S or D.\n\nBut if we go S at T=9, stay y=6 at T=10, but T=10 y=6 unsafe, collide.\n\nIf we go D at T=9 to y=5 at T=10.\n\ny=5 at T=10 is safe, as above.\n\nThen from y=5, we need to go up to y=9, which takes more turns.\n\nFor example, from y=5 at T=10, go U to y=6 at T=11, then U to y=7 at T=12, U to y=8 at T=13, U to y=9 at T=14. That would be longer, 6 actions? Let's not.\n\nFrom y=6 at T=9, going U to y=7 at T=10 is better.\n\nAnother idea: at T=8, go down to y=6, then at T=9 go U to y=7 at T=10, as before.\n\nCould we reach y=9 faster?\n\nFor example, if we could be at y=8 at some safe time.\n\ny=8 is unsafe only at T=9.\n\nAt T=8, y=8 is safe, but we start at y=7 at T=8, not y=8.\n\nAt T=8, if we were at y=8, it would be safe, but we are at y=7.\n\nWe can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo to be at y=8 at T=8, we would need to be there at start, but we are at y=7.\n\nAt T=10, y=8 is safe.\n\nBut from start, at T=8 y=7, we can't directly to y=8 at T=10 or something.\n\nActions per turn.\n\nMinimal H: since we have to go from 7 to 9, min 2 moves, but blocked, so we need to detour or wait.\n\nIn this case, by going down to y=6 at T=9, then up.\n\nTotal actions: from T=8 to T=11, four actions to reach at T=12.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think H actions.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, we are at y=9 at turn t_1 + H.\n\nt_1 + H - 1 or what? Let's see.\n\nStart at turn t_1, position given.\n\nAfter action at t_1, we go to position at t_1 +1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, we are at the position.\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nIn the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with action at t.\n\nSo at turn t, we take action a_t, then move to y_{t+1}.\n\nGiven at turn t_1, position y_{t_1}.\n\nAfter actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, we have y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the task: \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\" might be a typo?\n\nCheck: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nBut according to update, after action at t, we have y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t_1, we have y_{t_1}.\n\nAfter action at t_1, we have y_{t_1 +1} at turn t_1 +1.\n\n...\n\nAfter action at t_1 + k, we have y_{t_1 + k +1}.\n\nSet k such that y_{t_1 + k +1} =9.\n\nThen the last action is at t_1 + k, and H = number of actions, so k = H-1? Let's index.\n\nSet t = t_1 + τ for τ from 0.\n\nAt turn t_1 + τ, take action a_{t_1 + τ}, go to y_{t_1 + τ +1}.\n\nWe start at τ=0, turn t_1, take action, go to y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nBut the position at turn t_1 is given before action? Important.\n\nIn the game dynamics: \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t\"\n\nAnd \"at turn T, collision if on freeway y_T\"\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nWhen we take action at turn T, it affects y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T, then we choose action a_T, which determines Δy_T, so y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nCollision at turn T depends on y_T and the cars at time T.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t_1, position is given as (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,7)\n\nWe take action a_{t_1}, then go to y_{t_1 +1} at turn t_1 +1.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWe want to reach y_{t_1 + H} =9, I think, but the task says y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nCheck: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter how many actions?\n\nAt turn t_1, position y_{t_1}.\n\nAfter first action at t_1, we have position at turn t_1 +1: y_{t_1 +1}\n\nAfter second action at t_1 +1, position at turn t_1 +2: y_{t_1 +2}\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turns t_1 to t_1 + k -1, we have position at turn t_1 + k.\n\nSet y_{t_1 + k} =9.\n\nThen k is the number of actions, so H = k.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nBut the task says y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which would be position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nLook back: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t_1 + H -

1} =9\", which is different.\n\nPerhaps it's a typo, or I misread.\n\nIn the task: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nBut in the context, it might be that y_{t_1 + H -1} is the position when we reach.\n\nLet's read carefully:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), ... such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\"\n\nNow, the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, so actions at t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, i.e., actions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter taking these actions, the position is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want the position at some turn to be 9.\n\nIt says y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, we take the last action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which determines y_{t_1 + H}, but y_{t_1 + H -1} is before that action.\n\nSo to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, it means that at turn t_1 + H -1, we are already at y=9, before taking any action at that turn.\n\nThen we don't need to take action, but the sequence includes actions up to that point.\n\nFor example, if we are at y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1, then we might not need an action, but the sequence has H actions, including a_{t_1 + H -1} which might be S or something.\n\nLet's clarify with an example.\n\nSuppose we start at y=7, and we want to reach y=9.\n\nIf we take U at t_1, then at turn t_1 +1, y=8.\n\nThen take U at t_1 +1, at turn t_1 +2, y=9.\n\nSo after two actions: a_{t_1} and a_{t_1+1}, we have y_{t_1+2} =9.\n\nH=2, actions at t_1 and t_1+1.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1 +2 -1} = y_{t_1 +1} =8, which is not 9.\n\nBut we want y=9 at t_1+2.\n\nAccording to the formula, y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1+1} for H=2, which is 8, not 9.\n\nBut we reach at t_1+2.\n\nPerhaps it's y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the task description.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" up to some turn.\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9)\" at some turn.\n\nIn this case, for the sequence, after actions, we reach the position.\n\nPerhaps for the minimal H, we have y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nBut the task explicitly says y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nLet's see the note: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8 when on those freeways at turn T.\"\n\nFor the reaching, I think we need to be at (0,9) at some turn, and for that turn, if y=9, no collision possible.\n\nIn the sequence, with H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H with y=9.\n\nBut the task says y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nPerhaps it's a indexing off by one.\n\nI think for this problem, I'll assume that we need to have the position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9, meaning we reach before the H-th action or something.\n\nBut let's proceed with the sequence I have.\n\nIn my earlier plan, we reach y=9 at T=12.\n\nt_1=8, so at turn 12, y=9.\n\nH: actions from t=8 to t=11, so t=8,9,10,11, four actions.\n\nThen y_{12} =9.\n\nAccording to task, y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{8 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet 8 + H -1 =12, so H-1=4, H=5? No.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{8 + H -1} =9.\n\nBut we have y_{12} =9, so 8 + H -1 =12, then H-1=4, H=5.\n\nBut with 4 actions, we reach at turn 12.\n\nIf H=5, it would be more actions.\n\nI think there's confusion.\n\nPerhaps the position is reached after the actions.\n\nI think it's best to look at the answer format.\n\nThe answer should be like:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\n\n...\n\nUp to the last action.\n\nAnd after that, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn the task, \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\" might mean that at the turn when we take the last action, we are at y=9, but we take action to stay or something.\n\nLet's assume that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9 means that at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at position (0,9), and we may take an action, but since we are at goal, action might be S, but we are already there.\n\nBut the sequence includes actions to reach there.\n\nFor example, if we start at y=9, then H=0, no action, but t_1 + H -1 = t_1 -1, not defined.\n\nSo probably for H>=1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9 means that after H-1 actions, we are at y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen the last action a_{t_1 + H -1} might not be needed, but it's included.\n\nIn this case, for reaching in minimal turns, we can have H such that at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nThen for that, we need to be at y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn my sequence, at turn 12, y=9, with t_1=8, so 8 + H -1 =12, so H-1=4, H=5.\n\nBut with 4 actions, we reach at turn 12.\n\nIf we want to be at y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1, then for turn 12, t_1 + H -1 =12, t_1=8, so 8 + H -1 =12, H-1=4, H=5.\n\nThen we need to have y_{11} =9 or something? Messy.\n\nI think it's easier to ignore the index for now and focus on the sequence.\n\nWe start at turn 8, y=7.\n\nAfter actions, we want to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nWith the sequence: a8=D, to y=6 at T=9\n\na9=U, to y=7 at T=10\n\na10=U, to y=8 at T=11\n\na11=U, to y=9 at T=12\n\nSo at T=12, y=9.\n\nActions at T=8,9,10,11, so four actions.\n\nThe position is reached at T=12.\n\nNow for the task, we need to output the actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1 for some H.\n\nWith H=4, actions at t=8,9,10,11.\n\nThen y at t=12.\n\nBut the task says y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which would be y_{11} for H=4, but y_{11} is at T=11, which is y=8, not 9.\n\nSo inconsistency.\n\nPerhaps the turn indexing is different.\n\nAnother possibility: the position y_t is after action or before.\n\nI think there's a mistake in the task description.\n\nPerhaps \"turns\" include the starting turn.\n\nBut let's look for similar problems or assume.\n\nIn the collision note, it says \"at turn T\", position y_T.\n\nFor the sequence, I think for this problem, I'll proceed with the sequence and output the actions to reach y=9 at turn 12 with 4 actions.\n\nBut to match the format, let's see if we can reach earlier.\n\nIs there a way to reach y=9 in fewer turns?\n\nFor example, can we be at y=9 at T=10 or T=11?\n\nStart at T=8 y=7.\n\nAt T=8, if we go U, to y=8 at T=9, but at T=9 on y=8 collide.\n\nGo S, at T=9 on y=7 collide.\n\nGo D, to y=6 at T=9.\n\nThen at T=9, from y=6, if we go U, to y=7 at T=10.\n\nThen at T=10, from y=7, if we go U, to y=8 at T=11.\n\nThen to y=9 at T=12.\n\nAt T=10, from y=7, could we go directly to y=9? No, only one step per turn.\n\nSo minimal is 4 actions to reach at T=12.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can be at y=8 at a safe time.\n\ny=8 is safe at T=8 and T=10, but at T=8 we are at y=7.\n\nAt T=10, y=8 is safe, but to be at y=8 at T=10, we need to arrive at T=10 from previous.\n\nFor example, at T=9, we need to be at y=7 or y=9, but y=9 not possible.\n\nFrom T=9 position, if at y=7 at T=9, but y=7 at T=9 is unsafe, collide.\n\nIf at y=6 at T=9, we can go to y=7 at T=10.\n\nThen to y=8 at T=11.\n\nNo way to be at y=8 at T=10 directly.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 at T=10 impossible.\n\nSo minimal is to reach at T=12 with 4 actions.\n\nNow about the H and the index.\n\nPerhaps in the task, \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\" means that after H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H with y=9, but it says y_{t_1 + H -1}, so I think it's a error.\n\nPerhaps for the reaching turn, it is turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn that case, for us, we reach at turn 12, so t_1 + H -1 =12, t_1=8, so 8 + H -1 =12, H-1=4, H=5.\n\nThen we need to have actions up to a_{t_1 +4}, but we have only 4 actions to reach.\n\nIf H=5, we need 5 actions, but we can add a S at the end or something, but we are already at goal.\n\nFor example, at T=11, we are at y=8, then at T=11 we take U to go to y=9 at T=12.\n\nBut at T=11, position is y=8, not 9.\n\nIf we want y_{11} =9, we need to be at y=9 at T=11.\n\nHow? From T=8 y=7, in two moves: at T=8 U to y=8 at T=9, but collide at T=9.\n\nOr at T=8 D to y=6 at T=9, then at T=9 U to y=7 at T=10, not y=9.\n\nImpossible to be at y=9 before T=10.\n\nEarliest possible is T=10 if we could go up twice, but we can only move one per turn, so from y=7 to y=9 min two moves, arrive at T=10 if start at T=8 with two U.\n\nBut blocked.\n\nSo cannot before T=12.\n\nT=12 is the earliest.\n\nWith 4 actions.\n\nFor the output, I'll use H=4, actions at t=8,9,10,11.\n\nAnd in the box, list the actions.\n\nThen for the position, it is at t=12.\n\nBut since the task says y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which for H=4, t_1=8, t_1 + H -1 =11, y_11=8 not 9.\n\nSo not matching.\n\nPerhaps the turn when we reach is t_1 + H.\n\nI think I should go with the sequence.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"turns H\" includes the turns we take actions, and we reach at the end.\n\nI think for this, I'll proceed with the sequence.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nThen at turn 12, y=9.\n\nIn the answer, it should be for turns starting from t_1.\n\nSo in the box:\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nWith H=4.\n\nBut to match the format, let's assume that y_{t_1 + H} =9 with H actions.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn 11.\n\nFor example, if we go to a safe row earlier.\n\nSuppose at T=8, we go D to y=6 at T=9.\n\nThen at T=9, from y=6, we go U to y=7 at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, from y=7, we go U to y=8 at T=11.\n\nBut at T=11, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=11, we need to be at y=8 at T=10 or y=9 at T=10, impossible.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H=4 actions.\n\nNow, in the sequence, at T=11, we go U to y=9 at T=12.\n\nBut at T=11, position is y=8, which is safe.\n\nIn the plan, all safe.\n\nNow, about freeway y=6 at T=9: we are there, and it is safe, as span [-47,-12] for freeway 6 at T=9, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think this is the way.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought about other freeways, but we didn't need to go there.\n\nNow, to output.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nH=4\n\nBut for the box.\n\nPerhaps we can write the actions.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 8: D \\\\ Turn 9: U \\\\ Turn 10: U \\\\ Turn 11: U }\n\nWith H=4.\n\nBut the turn numbers are absolute, t_1=8.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be with variables, but since given, we can use numbers.\n\nIn the box, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo we can write:\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nAnd H=4.\n\nBut to confirm, is there a shorter H?\n\nSuppose at T=8, we go S, but collide at T=9.\n\nOr go U, collide.\n\nNo.\n\nGo D to y=6 at T=9.\n\nThen at T=9, go U to y=7 at T=10.\n\nThen at T=10, instead of U, go S to stay at y=7, but then we need to go to y=8 later, which takes more turns.\n\nOr go U directly, but y=7 to y=8, then to y=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt T=10, from y=7, go D to y=6, but y=6 at T=10 is unsafe, collide.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nThus, minimal is 4 turns.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis\n- At turn \\(t = 8\\), the player is at \\(y = 7\\). \n  - Freeway 7 at \\(t = 8\\): car span is \\([-95, -48]\\), 0 not in span, so safe.\n  - Actions:\n    - \\(U\\): move to \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 9\\). But at \\(t = 9\\), freeway 8 has span \\([-47, 0]\\), 0 in span, collision.\n    - \\(S\\): stay at \\(y = 7\\) at \\(t = 9\\). But at \\(t = 9\\), freeway 7 has span \\([-47, 0]\\), 0 in span, collision.\n    - \\(D\\): move to \\(y = 6\\) at \\(t = 9\\). At \\(t = 9\\), freeway 6 has span \\([-47, -12]\\), 0 not in span, safe. This is the only safe action.\n- At turn \\(t = 9\\), the player is at \\(y = 6\\).\n  - Freeway 6 at \\(t = 9\\): safe, as above.\n  - Actions:\n    - \\(U\\): move to \\(y = 7\\) at \\(t = 10\\). At \\(t = 10\\), freeway 7 has span \\([1, 48]\\), 0 not in span, safe.\n    - \\(S\\): stay at \\(y = 6\\) at \\(t = 10\\). But at \\(t = 10\\), freeway 6 has span \\([-11, 24]\\), 0 in span, collision.\n    - \\(D\\): move to \\(y = 5\\) at \\(t = 10\\). At \\(t = 10\\), freeway 5 has span \\([1, 12]\\), 0 not in span, safe, but moving down increases the path length unnecessarily.\n    Thus, \\(U\\) is optimal to progress toward \\(y = 9\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 10\\), the player is at \\(y = 7\\).\n  - Freeway 7 at \\(t = 10\\): safe, as above.\n  - Actions:\n    - \\(U\\): move to \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 11\\). At \\(t = 11\\), freeway 8 has span \\([49, 96]\\), 0 not in span, safe.\n    - \\(S\\) or \\(D\\): extend the path, not optimal.\n- At turn \\(t = 11\\), the player is at \\(y = 8\\).\n  - Freeway 8 at \\(t = 11\\): safe, as above.\n  - Action \\(U\\): move to \\(y = 9\\) at \\(t = 12\\). Since \\(y = 9\\) has no cars, it is safe and the goal is reached.\n\nThis sequence takes 4 turns (actions at \\(t = 8, 9, 10, 11\\)) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t = 12\\). No shorter sequence is possible due to collisions at critical turns.\n\n### Minimal Sequence\n- \\(H = 4\\)  \n- Actions:  \n  Turn 8: \\(D\\) (move to \\(y = 6\\) at \\(t = 9\\))  \n  Turn 9: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 7\\) at \\(t = 10\\))  \n  Turn 10: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 11\\))  \n  Turn 11: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 9\\) at \\(t = 12\\))  \n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 8: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U }",

The span is [h, τ] for left-moving or [τ, h] for right-moving, but since all cars here are right-moving (direction is \"right\"), the span at time t is [τ + s*(t - t_1), h + s*(t - t_1)] because they're moving right, so increasing.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\n- Right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s*(T - t_1), h + s*(T - t_1)]\n\nAnd collision occurs if the player is on that freeway at turn T and 0 is in Span(T) for that car. But the player is on freeway y at turn T if they are at position (0,y) during that turn.\n\nImportant note: if you move to a different y at turn T, you are not on that new y until the next turn. Specifically: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So at turn T, you are on y_T, and you choose an action to go to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nCollision happens at turn T if for the freeway y_T, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at time T.\n\nAlso, since the player starts at y=6 at turn t_1=9, and we need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, let's list the cars for each freeway at t_1=9:\n\n- Freeway 1: (h=36, τ=25, d=right, s=12) → since right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [25,36]? No.\n\nFrom the update rule: for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h]? Let's see the description.\n\nIt says: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving? No.\n\nLook: \"Car update rules: For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t_1, and speed s. Then at turn T > t_1, for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\"\n\nBut at T = t_1, Span(t_1) should be [τ, h] for right-moving, since [τ + s*0, h + s*0] = [τ, h].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] but decreasing.\n\nIn this case, all cars are right-moving, so for each, at time t, the span is [τ + s*(t - t_1), h + s*(t - t_1)].\n\nCollision on freeway k at time t if player is on y=k at time t and 0 is within the span for that car on freeway k at time t.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars, but here only one car per freeway? From the table, it seems each freeway has one car listed.\n\nLet me list for each freeway the car position at t_1=9:\n\nFreeway 1: h=36, τ=25, d=right, s=12 → so span at t_1 is [25, 36]? [τ, h] = [25,36]\n\nBut τ=25, h=36, and since right-moving, head is larger, so [τ, h] = [25,36] meaning from 25 to 36, inclusive I assume.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: h=6, τ=-5, d=right, s=6 → span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-5, 6]\n\nτ=-5, h=6, so [-5,6]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? (6, -5, right, 6) → [-5,6]\n\nFreeway 4: same (6,-5,right,6) → [-5,6]\n\nFreeway 5: same (6,-5,right,6) → [-5,6]\n\nFreeway 6: h=-12, τ=-47, d=right, s=36 → span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-47, -12]\n\nFreeway 7: h=0, τ=-47, d=right, s=48 → span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-47, 0]\n\nh=0, τ=-47, so [-47, 0]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, (0,-47,right,48) → [-47,0]\n\nNow, the player starts at y=6 at turn 9.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, so we need to increase y from 6 to 9, which requires at least 3 Up moves, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 3.\n\nSince we can only change y by -1,0,1 per turn, and y=9 is 3 above y=6, minimum H is 3 if we can go up three times directly without collision.\n\nBut we need to check for collisions at each turn when we are on a freeway.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, so when the player is on y=0 or y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible. y=0 and y=9 are safe, but we start at y=6, and need to reach y=9.\n\nAt turn T, when we are on y_T, we check if 0 is in the span of the car on that freeway at time T.\n\nIf we are moving, at turn T, we are on y_T, and we execute action to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nNow, for freeway y, the car span moves with time.\n\nLet me denote t_rel = T - t_1 = T - 9, so time relative to turn 9.\n\nFor each freeway, the span at time T = 9 + t_rel is:\n\nSpan(T) = [τ + s * t_rel, h + s * t_rel] for right-moving cars.\n\nThen, collision on freeway k at time T if player is on y=k at time T and 0 is in [τ + s*t_rel, h + s*t_rel] for that car.\n\nSince the span is a continuous interval, and 0 is a point, we need min(span) <= 0 <= max(span).\n\nFor right-moving, since span is [left, right] with left = τ + s*t_rel, right = h + s*t_rel, and since h > τ for right-moving (head is right), so min is left, max is right, so 0 is in span if left <= 0 <= right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right here.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the car and the times when 0 is in the span.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: τ=25, h=36, s=12\n\nSpan(T) = [25 + 12*t_rel, 36 + 12*t_rel]\n\n0 is in this if 25 + 12*t_rel <= 0 <= 36 + 12*t_rel\n\nBut 25 + 12*t_rel <=0? Since t_rel >=0, 25+12*t_rel >=25 >0, so always >0, thus 0 is never <= right, but left is at least 25>0, so 0 < left <= right, so 0 not in span for any t_rel. So freeway 1 is always safe? Let's see:\n\nLeft min: 25 +12*t_rel >=25 >0 for t_rel>=0, so indeed, 0 is less than min, so not in [min,max]. So on freeway 1, no collision possible for t>=9. Good.\n\nFreeway 2: τ=-5, h=6, s=6\n\nSpan(T) = [-5 + 6*t_rel, 6 + 6*t_rel]\n\n0 in span if -5 + 6*t_rel <= 0 <= 6 + 6*t_rel\n\nSince left <= right always.\n\nFirst inequality: -5 + 6*t_rel <=0 => 6*t_rel <=5 => t_rel <= 5/6 ≈ 0.833\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 6 + 6*t_rel always true for t_rel >=0.\n\nSo 0 in span when t_rel <= 5/6, i.e., for t_rel =0, which is T=9.\n\nt_rel <= 5/6, so since t_rel integer? Turns are discrete, so t_rel is integer, t_rel =0,1,2,...\n\nt_rel=0: -5 +0 = -5 <=0 <=6, yes 0 in [-5,6]\n\nt_rel=1: -5+6=1, 6+6=12, so [1,12], 0 not in [1,12]\n\nt_rel=2: [7,18], etc. So only at t_rel=0, T=9, 0 is in span.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3,4,5: same as freeway 2, since all have same parameters: (6,-5,right,6)\n\nSo for freeways 2,3,4,5, at T=9, 0 is in span, so if player is on y=2,3,4, or 5 at T=9, collision.\n\nBut player starts at y=6 at T=9, not on 2,3,4,5.\n\nNow freeway 6: τ=-47, h=-12, s=36\n\nSpan(T) = [-47 + 36*t_rel, -12 + 36*t_rel]\n\n0 in span if -47 + 36*t_rel <= 0 <= -12 + 36*t_rel\n\nFirst: -47 +36*t_rel <=0 => 36*t_rel <=47 => t_rel <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12 +36*t_rel => 36*t_rel >=12 => t_rel >= 12/36 = 1/3 ≈0.333\n\nSo for t_rel such that 1/3 <= t_rel <= 47/36, since 47/36≈1.305, so t_rel=1 only? t_rel integer.\n\nt_rel=0: left=-47 <=0, but right=-12 <0? 0 <= -12? No, 0 > -12, so 0 not <= right. right=-12 <0, so max is -12<0, min -47<0, but 0 not <= max since max<0. So 0 not in [-47,-12] because both ends negative.\n\nt_rel=1: left= -47+36= -11, right= -12+36=24, so [-11,24], 0 is between -11 and 24? -11 <=0<=24 yes, since 0<=24 true.\n\nt_rel=2: left= -47+72=25, right= -12+72=60, [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at t_rel=1, T=10, 0 in span for freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 7: τ=-47, h=0, s=48\n\nSpan(T) = [-47 + 48*t_rel, 0 + 48*t_rel] = [-47 +48*t_rel, 48*t_rel]\n\n0 in span if -47 +48*t_rel <= 0 <= 48*t_rel\n\nFirst: -47 +48*t_rel <=0 => 48*t_rel <=47 => t_rel <= 47/48 ≈ 0.979\n\nSecond: 0 <= 48*t_rel always for t_rel>=0.\n\nBut at t_rel=0: left=-47<=0, right=0, so 0 <= right? 0 <=0 is true, so 0 in [-47,0]? min=-47, max=0, so 0 is included if closed interval. Assuming intervals include endpoints.\n\nYes, collision if 0 in span, and since span includes endpoints, at t_rel=0, T=9, span=[-47,0], 0 is in it.\n\nt_rel=1: left= -47+48=1, right=48, [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=9, 0 in span for freeway 7.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8 same, at T=9, 0 in span.\n\nNow summarize collision times:\n\n- Freeway 1: never collision\n\n- Freeway 2: collision at T=9 only\n\n- Freeway 3: collision at T=9 only\n\n- Freeway 4: collision at T=9 only\n\n- Freeway 5: collision at T=9 only\n\n- Freeway 6: collision at T=10 only (since t_rel=1)\n\n- Freeway 7: collision at T=9 only\n\n- Freeway 8: collision at T=9 only\n\nPlayer starts at turn 9, y=6.\n\nAt turn 9, if player is on a freeway where collision happens, i.e., if y=2,3,4,5,7,8 at T=9.\n\nBut player is at y=6 at T=9.\n\nFreeway 6: at T=9, span is [-47,-12], 0 not in, so no collision at T=9 for y=6.\n\nFreeway 6 collision only at T=10.\n\nSo at turn 9, player on y=6: car on freeway 6 at T=9 has span [-47,-12], min=-47<0, max=-12<0, so 0 not in [-47,-12], no collision.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nEach action changes y for the next turn.\n\nLet me denote the turns starting from t=9.\n\nTurn T: player position y_T, action a_T determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nAt turn T, we are on y_T, and we check collision for freeway y_T at time T.\n\nWe start at T=9, y_9=6.\n\nNo collision at T=9 since y=6 is safe.\n\nNow, we want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no cars, safe.\n\nBut to get there, we need to be on y=8 or something and move up.\n\nSince min moves is 3 up, but we might need to avoid being on certain freeways at certain times.\n\nList the dangerous times:\n\n- For y=2,3,4,5: dangerous only at T=9\n\n- y=6: dangerous at T=10 (from freeway 6 collision)\n\n- y=7: dangerous at T=9 only\n\n- y=8: dangerous at T=9 only\n\ny=1: always safe, as we saw.\n\ny=6 has danger at T=10.\n\nPlayer at T=9, y=6, safe.\n\nNow, action at T=9: we can go to y=7,6, or5 for T=10.\n\ny_{10} depends on a_9.\n\nIf a_9 = U, then y_{10} =7\n\nIf a_9 = S, y_{10}=6\n\nIf a_9 = D, y_{10}=5\n\nAt turn T=10, we are on y_{10}, and check collision for that freeway at time T=10.\n\nFreeway at T=10:\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: at T=10, t_rel=1, for freeway 2: span=[-5+6*1, 6+6*1]= [1,12], min=1>0, so 0 not in, safe\n\nSimilarly y=3,4,5 same, at T=10, all have min >=1>0, safe.\n\ny=6: at T=10, t_rel=1, freeway 6 span: [-47+36, -12+36] = [-11,24], min=-11<=0, max=24>=0, so 0 in span, collision if on y=6 at T=10.\n\ny=7: at T=10, t_rel=1, freeway 7: span=[-47+48*1, 0+48*1]= [1,48], min=1>0, 0 not in, safe\n\ny=8: similarly, freeway 8 same as 7, at T=10, [1,48], safe.\n\nSo at T=10, only y=6 is dangerous; y=1,2,3,4,5,7,8 are safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other times.\n\nNow back to T=9.\n\nPlayer at y=6, safe.\n\nAction a_9:\n\n- If U, then y_{10} =7, which at T=10 is safe (since y=7 safe at T=10)\n\n- If S, then y_{10}=6, which at T=10 is dangerous, collision\n\n- If D, then y_{10}=5, which at T=10 is safe (y=5 safe at T=10)\n\nSo if we choose S at T=9, we go to y=6 at T=10 and collide, so we must not choose S.\n\nWe can choose U or D.\n\nIf U, we go to y=7 at T=10, safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up to y=8, etc.\n\nIf D, we go to y=5 at T=10, safe, but y=5 is farther from 9, so it might take longer.\n\nSince we want minimal H, probably better to go up.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, suppose we go up at T=9: a_9 = U, then y_{10} =7\n\nNow at T=10, y=7, safe, as above.\n\nNow action at T=10: we can go to y=8,7, or6.\n\ny_{11} depends on a_{10}.\n\nAt turn T=11, we need to check for each possible y_{11}.\n\nFirst, what are the car spans at T=11, t_rel=2.\n\nFreeway 1: [25+12*2, 36+12*2] = [25+24,36+24]=[49,60], min=49>0, safe\n\nFreeway 2: [-5+6*2,6+6*2]=[-5+12,6+12]=[7,18], min=7>0, safe\n\nSimilarly y=3,4,5: same, safe\n\nFreeway 6: [-47+36*2, -12+36*2]=[-47+72,-12+72]=[25,60], min=25>0, safe\n\nFreeway 7: [-47+48*2, 48*2]=[-47+96,96]=[49,96], min=49>0, safe\n\ny=8 same, safe.\n\nSo at T=11, all freeways are safe, no danger anywhere.\n\nSimilarly for later times, since all spans moving right, min increasing, so after some point all safe.\n\nNow back to T=10, y=7.\n\nWe can choose a_{10}:\n\n- If U, y_{11}=8\n\n- If S, y_{11}=7\n\n- If D, y_{11}=6\n\nAll are safe at T=11, as above.\n\nThen from y=8, we can go to y=9 with another U.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so when we reach y=9, we are done, no collision possible.\n\nNow, minimal H: from start, we need to reach y=9.\n\nCurrent y=6 at T=9.\n\nAfter one move, at T=10, y could be 5,6,7.\n\nBut we can't stay at 6 because collision at T=10.\n\nSo we go to 7 or 5.\n\nIf we go to 7 at T=10, then from there, we can go to 8 at T=11 with U, then to 9 at T=12 with U.\n\nSo at T=12, y=9.\n\nSequence: T=9: U, y=6 to y_{10}=7\n\nT=10: U, y_{11}=8\n\nT=11: U, y_{12}=9\n\nH=3 turns? Turns from t=9 to t=11, but let's see the time.\n\nTurn t_1 =9, we start at turn 9.\n\nAfter H turns, we have actions from t=9 to t=9+H-1, and position at t=9+H-1 should be (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t= t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have moved H times, so at turn t_1 + H, position is after the actions.\n\nDefine carefully.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, position is (0, y_t)\n\nThen we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nThen at the next turn, t+1, position is (0, y_{t+1})\n\nAnd during turn t, we are at y_t, and collision check for freeway y_t at time t.\n\nWe need to reach y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9? Let's see the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9)\" means that at some turn, position is (0,9).\n\nBut when? After the actions.\n\nThe sequence is actions for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter applying action a_{t_1 + H -1}, we get to position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nSet t_start = t_1 =9\n\nActions: a_{t_start}, a_{t_start+1}, ..., a_{t_start + H-1}\n\nAfter a_{t_start}, position at turn t_start +1\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t_start + H-1}, position at turn t_start + H\n\nAnd we want position at turn t_start + H to be (0,9)\n\nIn this case, at turn t_start + H, y_{t_start + H} =9\n\nBut during the turns, we need to avoid collision when on freeways.\n\nStart: at turn t=9, position (0,6)\n\nAfter action a_9, position at t=10 is (0, y_{10})\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{9 + H-1}, position at t=9+H is (0,9)\n\nH is the number of actions.\n\nMinimal H to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=6, we need to increase y by 3, so min H=3 if we can do U,U,U without collision.\n\nBut let's check if possible.\n\nSequence with H=3:\n\nActions at t=9,10,11 to reach y_{12}=9.\n\nPosition during:\n\nAt turn 9: y_9=6, on freeway 6. At T=9, freeway 6 span [-47,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction a_9: suppose U, then y_{10} =7\n\nAt turn 10: y_10=7, on freeway 7. At T=10, freeway 7 span: t_rel=1, [-47+48, 48] = [1,48], min=1>0, 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction a_10: U, then y_{11}=8\n\nAt turn 11: y_11=8, on freeway 8. At T=11, t_rel=2, freeway 8 span: [-47+96, 96] = [49,96]? h=0 for freeway 7 and 8? Freeway 7: h=0, τ=-47, s=48\n\nSpan at T=11: τ + s*(T-9) = -47 + 48*2 = -47 + 96 = 49\n\nh + s*(T-9) = 0 + 48*2 = 96\n\nSo [49,96], min=49>0, 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction a_11: U, then y_{12}=9\n\nAt turn 12: y=9, not a freeway, safe, and we reached (0,9).\n\nNow, during turn 11, we were on y=8, which was safe.\n\nIn this sequence, all safe, and H=3.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=6 at T=10 is dangerous, but in this case, we are not on y=6 at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, we are on y=7, which is safe.\n\nIn the sequence above, at no point are we on a dangerous spot.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nT=9: y=6, safe\n\nT=10: y=7, safe\n\nT=11: y=8, safe\n\nT=12: y=9, safe\n\nAnd we reached at t=12.\n\nH=3 actions: at t=9,10,11.\n\nThe actions are for turns t=9 to t=11, and position at t=12 is (0,9).\n\nIn the answer, it should list actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=9, H=3, so actions for turn 9,10,11.\n\nBut is there a shorter way? H=2? Can we reach in 2 actions?\n\nStart at t=9, y=6.\n\nAfter one action, at t=10, y could be 5,6,7.\n\nBut y=9 is 3 above, so from y=7 at t=10, we need to go to y=8 at t=11, then to y=9 at t=12, but with two actions, max we can go up to y=8 at t=11? Let's see.\n\nWith H actions, we start at t=9, after H actions, at t=9+H.\n\nTo have y_{9+H} =9.\n\nCurrent y_9=6.\n\nSo need to increase by 3, so min H=3, since each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nWith H=2 actions, y_{11} = y_9 + Δy9 + Δy10\n\nΔy can be -1,0,1, so y_{11} between 4 and 8, cannot be 9. Max y_{11}=6+1+1=8 if U,U.\n\nThen at t=11, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need y_{t} =9 for some t, which requires at least t=12 if starting from t=9 with y=6.\n\nt=9: y=6\n\nt=10: y=7 max if U\n\nt=11: y=8 max if another U\n\nt=12: y=9 if another U\n\nSo earliest at t=12, with H=3 actions.\n\nH=3 is minimum possible.\n\nAnd in the sequence above, it works with U,U,U.\n\nBut we need to confirm if at any point collision.\n\nIn the sequence: a_9=U, to y10=7\n\nAt turn 10: y=7, freeway 7 at T=10: span [1,48], 0 not in, safe.\n\na_10=U, to y11=8\n\nAt turn 11: y=8, freeway 8 at T=11: span [49,96], 0 not in, safe.\n\na_11=U, to y12=9, done.\n\nCould we go faster? No, H=3 min.\n\nBut what about other actions? For example, if we go down first, it would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nFor instance, if a_9=D, to y10=5, then we need to go up from 5 to 9, which takes at least 4 more actions? From y10=5, to y11=6, but at T=11, y=6 is safe? Earlier at T=11, freeway 6 span [25,60], min=25>0, safe, so we could go U from 5 to 6 at t=11, then to 7,8,9, but that would take longer, H=4 or more.\n\nNot minimal.\n\nSo the direct up is possible and minimal.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 6, at T=10, it is dangerous, but we are not on it at that time.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nIn the beginning, at T=9, y=6 is safe, and we move up immediately.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 6 at T=9.\n\nFreeway 6: at T=9, t_rel=0, span [τ, h] = [-47,-12], which is all negative, so 0 not in, yes.\n\nAnd at T=10, [ -47+36, -12+36] = [-11,24], which includes 0, so if we were on y=6 at T=10, collision.\n\nBut in our sequence, we are not.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7 at T=9: but we are not on it at T=9.\n\nIn our sequence, we are on y=7 at T=10, not T=9.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=3, with actions: U at t=9, U at t=10, U at t=11.\n\nNow, the answer should be in the format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nt_1=9, so:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, so three actions.\n\nNow, to be thorough, is there any reason we cannot do this?\n\nAnother thing: the note about moving to different y.\n\nFor example, at turn T=9, we are on y=6, we move to y=7, so at turn T=9, we are on y=6, not on y=7.\n\nThen at turn T=10, we are on y=7.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSimilarly, no collision.\n\nPerhaps we could do S or something, but not necessary.\n\nFor example, if we do S at t=9, we stay at y=6, but then at T=10, we are on y=6 and collide, since freeway 6 at T=10 has 0 in span.\n\nSo must not stay.\n\nDown would work but slower.\n\nSo U is best.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 7 and 8.\n\nFreeway 7: at T=10, span [1,48], 0 not in, yes.\n\nAt T=11, [49,96], no.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Collisions\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Car span at time \\(T\\) is \\([25 + 12(T-9), 36 + 12(T-9)]\\). Since the minimum value is 25 at \\(T=9\\) and increases, 0 is never in the span. Thus, freeway 1 is always safe.\n- **Freeway 2, 3, 4, 5 (y=2,3,4,5)**: Each car has the same parameters (head=6, tail=-5, direction=right, speed=6). Span at \\(T\\) is \\([-5 + 6(T-9), 6 + 6(T-9)]\\). 0 is in the span only at \\(T=9\\) (since \\(-5 \\leq 0 \\leq 6\\) at \\(T=9\\), but for \\(T=10\\), the span is \\([1,12]\\) and 0 is not included). Thus, these freeways are dangerous only at \\(T=9\\).\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Car span at \\(T\\) is \\([-47 + 36(T-9), -12 + 36(T-9)]\\). 0 is in the span only at \\(T=10\\) (span \\([-11, 24]\\), as \\(-11 \\leq 0 \\leq 24\\)).\n- **Freeway 7 and 8 (y=7,8)**: Each car has parameters (head=0, tail=-47, direction=right, speed=48). Span at \\(T\\) is \\([-47 + 48(T-9), 48(T-9)]\\). 0 is in the span only at \\(T=9\\) (span \\([-47, 0]\\), as \\(0\\) is included).\n\n### Path to (0, 9) with Minimal Turns\n- The player starts at turn 9, position (0, 6). At turn 9, freeway 6 is safe (span \\([-47, -12]\\), 0 not included).\n- To reach (0, 9) from (0, 6), at least 3 turns are required since y must increase by 3, and each action changes y by at most 1.\n- **Direct Path with 3 Turns**:\n  - **Turn 9 (y=6)**: Action \\(U\\) moves to y=7 at turn 10. Freeway 6 at turn 9 is safe.\n  - **Turn 10 (y=7)**: Action \\(U\\) moves to y=8 at turn 11. Freeway 7 at turn 10 (span \\([1, 48]\\)) is safe as 0 not included.\n  - **Turn 11 (y=8)**: Action \\(U\\) moves to y=9 at turn 12. Freeway 8 at turn 11 (span \\([49, 96]\\)) is safe as 0 not included.\n- This sequence reaches (0, 9) at turn 12 with no collisions. \\(H = 3\\) is minimal since \\(H = 2\\) cannot achieve y=9 (maximum y at turn 11 is 8).\n\n### Sequence of Actions\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 = 9\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 11\\) is:\n- Turn 9: \\(U\\)\n- Turn 10: \\(U\\)\n- Turn 11: \\(U\\)\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 10, and the player is at (0,7). The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8).\n\nThe player can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y remains). Note that y must be between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at that same turn.\n\nImportant: when moving from y to y' at turn T, the player is considered to be on y at turn T and on y' at turn T+1. So at the moment of moving (turn T), the player is still on the old row and will be subject to the cars on that row. Only at the next turn (T+1) will the player be on the new row.\n\nWe are to start at turn 10 at y=7. We want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nThe freeways are rows 1 to 8. We are currently on row 7. We need to move up to row 8 and then to row 9. However, note that row 9 is not a freeway (since freeways are 1-8) and hence no cars to avoid. But the goal is (0,9). So we must be at row 9 at some turn.\n\nThe challenge is to avoid cars on rows 1 to 8. We are starting on row 7 and we need to go through row 8 to get to 9.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn 10 (current turn) for each freeway row (1 to 8). The cars are defined by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note:\n\n- For a right-moving car: the car is moving to the right. The span at time t is [τ + s*(t-t1), h + s*(t-t1)]? Actually, the update rule says:\n\n  - Right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n  But note: at t1, the span is [τ, h] (as given in the table). For example, row 1: (48,37,right,12) -> at t1=10, the car is from 37 to 48? But wait, the table says head=48, tail=37? And direction right. So the head is at 48 and tail at 37? Then the span at time t1 is [37,48]? Actually, the update rule for right-moving says: at t1, the car span is [τ, h] = [37,48]. Then at time T, it becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] = [37+12*(T-10), 48+12*(T-10)].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car, we would have: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. But note: the problem states for left-moving: \"Span(t1)=[h, τ]\" and then becomes [h-s*(T-t1), τ-s*(T-t1)]. But in our case, all cars are right-moving.\n\nSo for each row and each car, we can compute the span at any future turn T.\n\nBut note: each row has exactly one car? The table lists one car per row. So for row k, we have one car.\n\nWe must avoid being on row k at turn T if the car on row k at turn T has 0 in its span.\n\nWe are at row 7 at turn 10. We are going to plan the next moves.\n\nThe goal: reach (0,9). We can be at row 9 at any turn. Since row 9 has no car, we only worry about the freeways (1-8) during the journey.\n\nWe start at row 7. We want to go to row 8 and then row 9. But we must avoid the car on row 7 and row 8 at the turns when we are on them.\n\nWe are at row 7 at turn 10. So we must check the car on row 7 at turn 10: is 0 in its span?\n\nRow 7: (48,1,right,48) -> wait, the table says for row 7: (48,1,right,48). So at t1=10, the car span is [1,48]. Then at turn T, the car span is [1+48*(T-10), 48+48*(T-10)].\n\nAt turn 10: [1,48]. 0 is not in [1,48] -> safe.\n\nNow, we must also check the next moves.\n\nWe have two moves to make: from 7 to 8 to 9. But we can also stay or even go down? However, going down would take us away from the goal. So we want to go up as fast as possible? But we have to avoid the cars on row 7 and row 8.\n\nLet's compute the car positions on row 7 and row 8 for a few turns.\n\nFirst, row 7 (freeway 7) at turn T (relative to t1=10):\n  car: [1 + 48*(T-10), 48+48*(T-10)]\n\nWe are on row 7 at turn T only if we are at that row at that turn. We start at turn 10 at row 7. Then at turn 10, we choose an action that will determine our position at turn 11.\n\nWe are at row 7 at turn 10. We are safe at turn 10 (as 0 not in [1,48]).\n\nNow, we can choose U, D, or S.\n\nIf we choose U at turn 10, then at turn 11 we will be at row 8.\n\nBut note: during turn 10, we are still on row 7. Then at turn 11, we are on row 8.\n\nSo when we are at row 7 at turn 10, we must avoid the car on row 7 at turn 10 (which we are safe). Then if we move up, at turn 11 we are at row 8 and we must check the car on row 8 at turn 11.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose S at turn 10, then at turn 11 we are still at row 7 and we must check row 7 at turn 11.\n\nRow 8: (48,1,right,48) -> same as row 7? Actually, the table says row 8: (48,1,right,48). So same as row 7.\n\nSo row 8 car: [1+48*(T-10), 48+48*(T-10)]\n\nNow, we are at row 7 at turn 10. We want to get to row 8 and then row 9 as quickly as possible.\n\nOption 1: U at turn 10 -> then at turn 11 we are at row 8.\n\nCheck row 8 at turn 11: T=11 -> [1+48*(11-10)=49, 48+48=96]. Since 0 is not in [49,96], safe.\n\nThen at turn 11, we can choose U to go to row 9. Then at turn 12 we are at row 9 -> goal achieved in 2 moves? H=2? But the sequence would be:\n\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nBut wait, we must check if we are safe at row 8 at turn 11? We are safe.\n\nAlso, at turn 10: we are on row 7 and safe (as established).\n\nSo is that it? But let me check row 7 at turn 10: safe. Then at turn 11, we are at row 8: safe. Then at turn 12, we are at row 9 and done.\n\nBut wait: what about the other rows? We are only on row 7 at turn 10 and row 8 at turn 11. We don't go through any other row. So we only care about row 7 at turn 10 and row 8 at turn 11.\n\nHowever, let me double-check the car on row 8 at turn 11: [1+48*1=49, 48+48=96]. 0 is not in [49,96] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 at turn 10: [1,48] -> safe.\n\nBut wait, the table has more rows. Why are we not considering the other rows? Because we are only on row 7 and row 8 during the journey. We start at row 7 and then go to row 8 and then to row 9. We don't set foot on row 1,2,3,4,5,6. So we don't care about the cars on those rows.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2: we do two up moves.\n\nBut wait: what if we are forced to avoid something? Let me check row 7 at turn 10: safe. Row 8 at turn 11: safe. So no problem.\n\nBut why are the other rows provided? Maybe if we had to go through them? But we don't. We are starting at 7 and going to 8 and then 9.\n\nBut let me check if we can even stay? We want minimal turns. So 2 is minimal.\n\nBut what about the car on row 6? We never go to row 6, so we don't care.\n\nBut wait: the car on row 6: (24,-11,right,36). At turn 10: span is [-11,24]? Because for right-moving: at t1, span is [tail, head] = [-11,24]. Then at turn T: [-11+36*(T-10), 24+36*(T-10)].\n\nBut we are never on row 6, so we don't care.\n\nSimilarly, row 1: (48,37,right,12) -> at turn 10: [37,48]. Then at turn T: [37+12*(T-10), 48+12*(T-10)].\n\nWe are never on row 1.\n\nSo the plan is: U at turn 10, then U at turn 11.\n\nBut wait, what if we are at row 8 at turn 11? We are safe. Then at turn 11 we do U, then at turn 12 we are at row 9.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nH=2? But the player reaches row 9 at turn 12? Let me see:\n\nAt turn 10: we are at (0,7). We do U -> at turn 11: y = 7+1 = 8.\nAt turn 11: we are at (0,8). We do U -> at turn 12: y = 8+1 = 9.\n\nSo at turn 12 we are at (0,9). The number of actions is 2 (turns 10 and 11). So H=2.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that after H actions we are at 9. So at the start (turn t1) we are at 7. Then after H actions, we are at 9.\n\nAfter 1 action: at turn 11, we are at 8 -> not 9.\nAfter 2 actions: at turn 12, we are at 9 -> goal.\n\nSo H=2.\n\nBut is there a reason we cannot do this? Let me check the safety at row 8 at turn 11: as above, the car is at [49,96] -> 0 not in the interval -> safe.\n\nBut wait: what if the car on row 8 at turn 10? We are not on row 8 at turn 10, so we don't care.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 11, we are on row 8 and the car on row 8 at turn 11 is at [49,96] -> safe.\n\nBut wait: the car on row 8 at turn 10 is at [1,48]? Then at turn 11 it moves to [49,96]. So at no turn is 0 in the car's span on row 8? Actually, we must check when the car passes 0.\n\nThe car on row 8: [1+48*(T-10), 48+48*(T-10)]\n\nSet the interval to contain 0:\n\n1 + 48*(T-10) <= 0 <= 48+48*(T-10)\n\nBut note: the car is moving to the right. The left end at turn 10 is 1, then at turn 11 is 49, so it never covers 0. Similarly, the left end increases. So 0 is never covered.\n\nSame for row 7: at turn 10: [1,48] -> doesn't cover 0. Then at turn 11: [49,96] -> doesn't cover 0. So row 7 is safe at turn 10 and 11? But we are only on row 7 at turn 10. At turn 11, we are on row 8.\n\nBut what if we had to wait? Then we might be on row 7 at turn 11. But we don't have to wait because we can move up immediately.\n\nBut let me check the other rows in case there is a problem. For example, what if we go to row 8 at turn 11 and it is safe, but then if we stay on row 8? But we don't: we move up immediately.\n\nSo why are there multiple rows? And why are there rows with the same car? Actually, rows 7 and 8 are identical? And rows 2,3,4,5 have the same car: (12,1,right,6). But we are not going to those rows.\n\nSo the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". We are on row 7 at turn 10 and row 8 at turn 11. Both are safe.\n\nBut what about the car on row 6? We are not on row 6. Similarly, row 5,4,3,2,1: we are not on them.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nBut let me double-check the car on row 7 at turn 10: [37,48] for row 1? No, row 7 is (48,1,right,48) -> so at turn 10: [1,48]. 0 is not in [1,48] -> safe.\n\nRow 8 same.\n\nBut wait, there is a row 6: (24,-11,right,36). At turn 10: [-11,24]. 0 is in [-11,24]? Yes, because -11<=0<=24. So if we were on row 6 at turn 10, we would crash. But we are not on row 6 at turn 10. We are on row 7.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 11: row 6 car: [-11+36, 24+36] = [25,60] -> 0 not in there. But again, we are not on row 6.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut what if we had to go down? We don't.\n\nSo why is row 6 having 0 at turn 10? That might be a problem for someone starting at row 6, but we start at row 7.\n\nTherefore, the minimal path is 2 moves.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\". So H=2.\n\nBut let me consider if we can do it in 1 move? That would be: at turn 10, do U -> then at turn 11 we are at row 8, not 9. So we are not at 9. Then we need a second move. So no.\n\nStaying or going down would be worse.\n\nSo H=2.\n\nBut just to be thorough, what if we do S at turn 10? Then we are still at row 7 at turn 11. Then we must check row 7 at turn 11: [1+48=49,48+48=96] -> safe. Then at turn 11 we can do U to go to row 8 at turn 12. Then at turn 12 we are at row 8, and then at turn 12 we do U to go to row 9 at turn 13. That would be 3 moves. Worse.\n\nSimilarly, if we do D at turn 10, we go to row 6 at turn 11. Then we must check row 6 at turn 11: as above, [25,60] -> safe. But then we are at row 6 and we have to go back up, which would take more moves.\n\nSo minimal is 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nBut the format: \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\" and then \"Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\".\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nBut note: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so two actions: at t=0 (turn 10) and t=1 (turn 11).\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So t=0 corresponds to turn t1, t=1 to turn t1+1, etc.\n\nSo we have two actions: at turn 10 and turn 11.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n\nBut why did the problem give so many rows? Maybe to trick us? Or maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAnother thought: when we are at row 7 at turn 10, we are safe. Then we move up to row 8 at turn 11. But at turn 11, we are at row 8, and we must check the car on row 8 at turn 11: safe. Then we move up to row 9 at turn 12. So we are never on row 9 at a turn when we have to check? Actually, row 9 is not a freeway, so no car. So at turn 12, we are at row 9 and we are done.\n\nBut what about the move from row 8 to row 9? At turn 11, we are at row 8. Then we choose U at turn 11. Then at turn 12, we are at row 9. During turn 11, we are at row 8 (so we check row 8 at turn 11: safe). Then at turn 12, we are at row 9 and the game ends. We don't check row 9 because it's not a freeway.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nBut let me check row 8 at turn 10: [1,48] -> if we were there at turn 10, we would crash? But we are not.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 at turn 11: [49,96] -> safe.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut wait: the car on row 2: (12,1,right,6). At turn 10: [1,12]. Then at turn 11: [7,18]. At turn 12: [13,24]. So 0 is never covered. Similarly, row 3,4,5 same. Row 1: at turn 10: [37,48] -> doesn't cover 0. Then at turn 11: [49,60] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\nRow 6: at turn 10: [-11,24] -> covers 0. So if we were on row 6 at turn 10, we crash. But we are not.\n\nSo I think the answer is two up moves.\n\nBut let me see if there is any constraint I missed.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, and y must be in [0,9]. So from 8 we can go up to 9, which is valid.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". H=2? But actually, we are using two turns (turn 10 and turn 11) and we reach at turn 12. But the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\". And we reach at turn 12. But note: the minimal H is the number of actions. The problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" but then in the sequence, we have H actions. And we reach at turn t1 + H.\n\nSo H=2.\n\nSometimes people count the turns including the starting turn? But the problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence is for t=0 to H-1. So H is the number of actions.\n\nWe start at turn t1=10. After 0 actions, we are at turn 10. After 1 action, we are at turn 11. After 2 actions, we are at turn 12 and at (0,9).\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 7\\) at turn 10. The minimal path to \\(y = 9\\) requires moving up twice:\n- Move up (U) at turn 10 to reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 11.\n- Move up (U) at turn 11 to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12.\n\nCollision checks:\n- At turn 10, the player is at \\(y = 7\\). The car on freeway 7 has span \\([1 + 48 \\times (10-10), 48 + 48 \\times (10-10)] = [1, 48]\\). Since 0 is not in \\([1, 48]\\), no collision occurs.\n- At turn 11, the player is at \\(y = 8\\). The car on freeway 8 has span \\([1 + 48 \\times (11-10), 48 + 48 \\times (11-10)] = [49, 96]\\). Since 0 is not in \\([49, 96]\\), no collision occurs.\n\nThe player does not enter any other freeways (\\(y = 1\\) to \\(6\\)), so cars on those rows are irrelevant. The goal \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway, so no collision check is needed there.\n\nThis path achieves the goal in \\(H = 2\\) turns (actions at turns 10 and 11).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 11, and the player is at (0,8). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nNote: The player moves vertically (U: up, D: down, S: stay) and the horizontal position is always 0. The collision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway k (which is the y-coordinate) and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that exact turn.\n\nImportant: When the player moves from y to y' at turn T, at turn T the player is still on row y. At the next turn (T+1), the player will be on row y'. So when moving at turn T, we only check the car on the current row (y) at turn T.\n\nWe start at turn 11, at y=8. We need to reach y=9.\n\nSince we are at y=8 and we want to go to y=9, the minimal moves would be one move: U at turn 11. Then at turn 12, we would be at y=9. But we must avoid collisions.\n\nAt turn 11 (current turn) we are at y=8. So we are on freeway 8 at turn 11. We must check the car on freeway 8 at turn 11.\n\nCar on freeway 8: (head=96, tail=49, direction=right, speed=48)\n\nSince it's right-moving, the car moves to the right. The span at turn T is given by:\n  [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]   [because at t1, the span is [tau, h] for right-moving]\n\nBut note: the problem says at turn t1 (current turn) the car state is given. So at turn t1=11, the car on freeway 8 has:\n  head = 96, tail = 49 -> so the span is [49, 96] (since right-moving, the head is at the right end, so the car goes from 49 to 96).\n\nThen at any turn T (>=11), the car's span is:\n  [49 + 48*(T-11), 96 + 48*(T-11)]\n\nWe are at turn 11, and we are at (0,8). We are on freeway 8 at turn 11. We must check if 0 is in the span of the car on freeway 8 at turn 11.\n\nAt T=11:\n  49 + 48*(0) = 49\n  96 + 48*(0) = 96\n  So the span is [49, 96]. 0 is not in [49,96] -> no collision at turn 11.\n\nNow, if we take action U at turn 11, then at turn 12 we will be at y=9 (which is the goal). But note: at turn 12, we are at y=9. However, there are no freeways above 8? The freeways are from 1 to 8. The goal is at y=9, which is above the freeways. So we don't have to worry about cars at y=9.\n\nBut note: the collision condition is only for freeways y=1,...,8. Therefore, when the player is at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars. So at turn 12, we are at y=9 and we are safe.\n\nHowever, we must also consider the move: at turn 11, we are moving from y=8 to y=9. At turn 11 we are still on y=8, and we've already checked that at turn 11 the car on y=8 does not cover 0. Then at turn 12 we are at y=9, which is safe.\n\nSo one move: U at turn 11.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway 8 at turn 11: it's [49,96] and 0 is not in there. So we are safe.\n\nHowever, the problem says that the initial state is given at turn t1=11, and the car state is as above. But note that the car on freeway 8 is the only one we care about at turn 11 (because we are at y=8).\n\nBut wait: what about the next turn? We are only at turn 11 and then we move to turn 12. We don't need to check freeway 8 at turn 12 because at turn 12 we are at y=9.\n\nSo the minimal H is 1, and the action is U at turn 11.\n\nBut let me check the other freeways? We are at y=8 at turn 11, so we only care about freeway 8 at turn 11. The other freeways are irrelevant for turn 11.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nBut the problem says: we are to provide a sequence for t from t1 to t1+H-1. Since H=1, we only have one action at t1.\n\nBut wait: the player update says that at the next turn we are at y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t. So at turn 11 we do an action, and then at turn 12 we are at the new position. So we only need to do one action at turn 11 (U) to be at y=9 at turn 12.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 1.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway 8 again. The car is moving to the right. At turn 11: [49,96] -> 0 is not in [49,96]. So safe.\n\nBut what if the car was moving left? Then the formula would be different. But it's right.\n\nAlternatively, the problem says: for a left-moving car, the span at T is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. But this car is right-moving.\n\nSo I think we are safe.\n\nBut wait, there is a car on freeway 8: (96,49,right,48). That seems long: 96-49+1=48? Actually, the length is 96-49+1=48, and speed is 48, so it moves one car length per turn? But anyway, the position at turn 11 is [49,96] and 0 is not in that interval.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nBut let me check if we are missing something. The problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". At turn 11 we are on freeway 8 and we are safe. Then at turn 12 we are at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". At turn 12, we are at y_T = 9, and there is no freeway 9, so no car to check. So safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of turns is 1.\n\nBut wait: the initial position is (0,8). The goal is (0,9). So we just move up.\n\nBut why are the other cars given? Maybe to trick? Or maybe if we had to go through other rows? But we are already at row 8, and we only need to go to row 9.\n\nAlternatively, what if we had to go down? But we are at 8 and the goal is at 9, so we must go up.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway 8 again: the description says \"head\" and \"tail\". For a right-moving car, the head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the leftmost. So at turn 11, the car covers [49,96]. Since 0 is to the left of 49, we are safe.\n\nBut what if we had to wait? Then we would do S at turn 11 and then U at turn 12. But that would take two moves. Since we can do it in one, we do one.\n\nBut let me check if the car on freeway 8 at turn 11 is going to cover 0 at turn 12? But at turn 12 we are not on freeway 8. We are at y=9 at turn 12, so we don't care about freeway 8 at turn 12.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Here H=1, so t=0 only. So a_{t1+0} = a_{11} = U.\n\nSo we write:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nBut the formatting says:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: a_{11}\n}\n\nBut we need to write the action.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nBut let me check the other freeways just in case? We are not going to be on them at turn 11. We are only on freeway 8 at turn 11.\n\nBut what if we decide to move down? That would be away from the goal. So we don't.\n\nTherefore, the answer is U at turn 11.\n\nBut wait: the problem says the current turn is t1=11, and we are at (0,8). We need to output the action for turn 11 and then subsequent turns until we reach the goal. Since we reach the goal at the next turn (turn 12) with one action, we only have one action.\n\nSo the boxed answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". H is the number of turns we are taking actions? From turn 11 to turn 11+H-1. We are taking one action at turn 11, and then at turn 12 we are at the goal. So H=1.\n\nAlternatively, H might be the number of turns including the starting turn? But the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and we reach the goal at turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me see: \n  At turn t1 (11) we start at (0,8). Then we do an action at turn 11. Then at the next turn (turn 12) we are at a new state. So we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nWe want: t1+H-1 = 11+H-1 = 12? Then H=2? \n\nBut wait, that would mean we are at the goal at turn 12, and we have taken actions at turn 11 and turn 12? But we only need to take one action at turn 11 to be at turn 12 at (0,9). Then we don't need an action at turn 12 because we are already at the goal.\n\nThe problem says: we are to provide a sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1. And after H actions, we are at the goal at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut note: the state after H actions is at turn t1+H. So we want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nLet me read: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nSo at the turn after the last action, we are at the goal. The last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H we are at the goal? But the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nActually, the sequence is for turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. And we require that at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). \n\nBut note: the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken at that turn, and then the next state (at turn t1+H) is determined. So to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, we must already be there at the beginning of that turn? \n\nBut the state is updated at the next turn. So at the beginning of turn t1, we are at (0,8). Then we take an action at turn t1, and then at the beginning of turn t1+1, we are at a new y.\n\nTherefore, we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+1? Then we would have taken one action at turn t1. So the turn when we are at the goal is turn t1+1 = 12, which is t1+H-1. Then:\n\n  t1+H-1 = 12\n  11 + H - 1 = 12\n  H = 12 - 10 = 2\n\nBut that would imply two actions? \n\nAlternatively, let me read the problem again: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and we require that at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9).\n\nBut note: the state at turn t1 is the starting state. Then we take action a_{t1} (which is t=0) at turn t1. Then at turn t1+1, we are at a new state. Then we take action a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1 (if H>1), and so on, until we take the last action at turn t1+H-1. Then the state at the beginning of turn t1+H is determined by the last action.\n\nBut the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\", meaning at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Or after the action of turn t1+H-1?\n\nThe problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if ... at turn T\". And the state at turn T is the state at the beginning of the turn? Then we take an action and move to the next state.\n\nBut the goal condition is: we require that at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). So that means at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). But if we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to take an action at that turn? But the sequence of actions includes up to turn t1+H-1.\n\nAlternatively, if we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we are done. But the problem says \"a sequence of actions\" for t from t1 to t1+H-1. So if we are at the goal at the beginning of turn t1, then we don't need to take any action? But we are not: we are at (0,8).\n\nSo let me define:\n  At turn t1 (11): we are at (0,8). Then we take an action a_{11}. Then at the beginning of turn 12, we are at a new y.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn 12. Then the turn when we are at the goal is turn 12. And 12 = t1+H-1? Then 11+H-1=12 -> H=2.\n\nBut we only take one action: at turn 11. So the sequence has two actions? But we don't need an action at turn 12 because we are already at the goal.\n\nThe problem says: we are to provide actions until the turn when we are at the goal. But note that at turn 12, we are at the goal, so we don't need to take an action at turn 12. So the last action we take is at turn 11. Therefore, H=1: we take one action at turn 11, and then at turn 12 (which is t1+1) we are at the goal.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". If H=1, then t1+H-1 = 11+1-1=11. But at turn 11, we are still at (0,8). So we are not at the goal at turn 11.\n\nTherefore, we must be at the goal at turn 12. And 12 = t1+H-1? Then 11+H-1=12 -> H=2.\n\nSo we must have two actions? But how? We start at turn 11 at (0,8). We take an action at turn 11 (say U) and then at turn 12 we are at (0,9). Then we are done. But the problem says we must be at the goal at turn t1+H-1=12. And we are. But then the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, i.e., turn 11 and turn 12? But we don't need an action at turn 12.\n\nThe problem does not say we must take an action after reaching the goal. So we only need to take actions until the turn before we are at the goal? But the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and we are at the goal at turn t1+H-1.\n\nWith H=2, the sequence would be:\n  a_{t1+0} = a_{11} = U\n  a_{t1+1} = a_{12} = ? \n\nBut at turn 12, we are already at (0,9). So we don't need to do anything. We can set a_{12} to S (stay). Then we are still at (0,9) at turn 13. But the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn 12. So if we do S at turn 12, we are still at (0,9) at turn 13, which is after the required turn.\n\nAlternatively, we must be at the goal at turn 12, so we don't need to take an action at turn 12. The action at turn 11 is enough.\n\nBut the problem requires the sequence to include H actions, and the goal is achieved at the turn after the last action? But it says \"at turn t1+H-1\", which is the turn of the last action.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me look at the example: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". And the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSo the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and at that same turn (t1+H-1) the player is at (0,9)? But how can that be? Because the player moves at the next turn.\n\nUnless the state is updated immediately? But the update rule says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t. So the new position is at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, at the turn when we take the action, we are still at the previous position. So to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, we must have been there at the beginning of that turn, and then we take an action (which might be S) to stay.\n\nBut if we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we can take S to stay. Then we are still at (0,9) at the next turn.\n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So if we are already there at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we are done at that turn. But we still need to take an action? The problem requires a sequence of actions until the turn when we are at the goal.\n\nAlternatively, the goal is achieved at the turn after the last action.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nSo let me re-interpret: we are to provide H actions, and after these H actions, at turn t1+H-1, we are at the goal. But how? Because the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then the next state is at turn t1+H.\n\nUnless we consider the state at the end of the turn? But the collision condition is checked at the turn T for the state at T? \n\nI think there is a misunderstanding.\n\nLet me read carefully: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd the player's position at turn T is given by (0, y_T). And y_T is the row at turn T.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo at turn T, the player is at y_T. Then we choose an action a_T, which determines Delta y_T, and then at turn T+1, the player moves to y_{T+1} = y_T + Delta y_T.\n\nTherefore, at turn T, the player is at y_T, and we are vulnerable to collision on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nSo to be at the goal (0,9) at turn T, we must have y_T = 9.\n\nWe start at turn 11: y_11 = 8.\n\nWe want to be at y_{12} = 9? Then we are at the goal at turn 12.\n\nSo we want to be at the goal at turn 12. Turn 12 is t1+1.\n\nWe want turn t1+H-1 = 12 -> 11+H-1=12 -> H=2.\n\nThen we must provide two actions: for turn 11 and turn 12.\n\nAt turn 11: we are at y=8. We take U, then at turn 12 we are at y=9.\n\nThen at turn 12: we are at y=9. But the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn 12 (which is t1+H-1=12). So we are there. But we still need to provide an action for turn 12? What action? We are already at the goal. We can do S (stay).\n\nSo the sequence would be:\n  Turn 11: U\n  Turn 12: S\n\nThen at turn 12, we are at y=9 (from the previous action). Then we do S, and then at turn 13 we are still at y=9. But the requirement is to be at (0,9) at turn 12. We are there at the beginning of turn 12. The action at turn 12 is taken at turn 12, and we are at y=9 during turn 12, so we are safe because there are no cars at y=9. Then we do S, which is fine.\n\nSo H=2.\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence? We must be at the goal at turn 12, so we need to have moved by then. The only way is to move up at turn 11. Then at turn 12 we are at 9. And then we must provide an action for turn 12? Yes, because H=2 and the sequence includes two actions.\n\nBut the minimal H is 2? But we only need one action to get there. The extra action is just to satisfy the sequence length.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might allow H=1 meaning that we are at the goal at turn 11. But we are not.\n\nSo I think H=2 is the minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm with the problem: \"minimal number of turns H\". What does H represent? It says: \"the minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence is for H actions.\n\nAnd we are to reach the goal at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo to be at the goal at turn 11, we would need H-1=0 -> H=1, but we are not at the goal at turn 11.\n\nTo be at the goal at turn 12, we need H-1=1 -> H=2.\n\nTherefore, we must have H=2.\n\nAnd the sequence is:\n  a_{11} = U\n  a_{12} = S   (or any action, but we are already at the goal, so S is safe)\n\nBut what if we do U again at turn 12? Then we would try to go to y=10, but the grid is only up to 9, so y_{13} = min(9, 9+1)=9? According to the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and do U, then y_{13} = 10 -> but clamped to 9. So it stays. But then we are still at 9. But we are required to be at the goal at turn 12. We are there regardless of the action at turn 12.\n\nBut the action at turn 12 must be chosen to avoid collision? But at turn 12, we are at y=9, and there are no cars on freeway 9, so any action is safe. We can do S, U, or D. But D would move down to 8, which is not what we want, but the requirement is only to be at the goal at turn 12. So even if we move down at turn 12, at turn 12 we are still at y=9? No: at the beginning of turn 12, we are at y=9. Then we take an action at turn 12. The action at turn 12 will change the position at turn 13. But at turn 12, we are still at y=9. So for collision, we only care about turn 12: we are at y=9, so no car -> safe.\n\nSo we can do any action at turn 12. But to be safe and not move away, we can do S.\n\nSo the sequence is U at turn 11 and S at turn 12.\n\nBut is there a way to be at the goal at turn 11? Only if we were already there, but we are not.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 2.\n\nBut earlier I thought only one action is needed, but the problem requires us to be at the goal at the turn of the last action, which is not possible without an extra action to \"wait\" at the goal.\n\nBut note: at turn 11, we are at y=8. We take U at turn 11 -> then at turn 12, we are at y=9. So we are at the goal at turn 12. Then we need to provide an action for turn 12 to complete the sequence of H=2 actions.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n}\n\nBut let me check if we can be faster? H=2 is minimal because we cannot be at the goal at turn 11.\n\nNow, what about the car at freeway 8 at turn 11? We already checked: at turn 11, the car is at [49,96], so 0 is not in there. Safe.\n\nAt turn 12, we are at y=9, so no car. Safe.\n\nBut what if we do D at turn 11? Then we go to y=7 at turn 12. Then we are at freeway 7 at turn 12. We have to check the car on freeway 7.\n\nCar on freeway 7: (96,49,right,48)\n\nAt turn 12 (which is T = 12, t1=11, so T-t1=1):\n  The car becomes: [49+48*1, 96+48*1] = [97, 144]. 0 is not in [97,144]. Safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=7, not 9. Then we would have to move up twice, so H would be at least 3: \n  Turn11: D -> to 7 at turn12\n  Turn12: U -> to 8 at turn13\n  Turn13: U -> to 9 at turn14\n\nThen we are at 9 at turn14. But we must be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 11+H-1 = 14 -> H=4.\n\nThat is worse.\n\nSo our plan with H=2 is better.\n\nBut is there a way to be at 9 at an earlier turn? The earliest is turn 12.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 2.\n\nBut let me check if we can do without an action at turn 12? The problem requires a sequence of H actions. For H=2, we must provide two actions.\n\nSo we provide U and then S.\n\nAlternatively, we could provide U and then U, but that doesn't change the position. Or U and then D, which would move down at turn 13 to 8, but we are at the goal at turn 12, so it's allowed. But we are required to be at the goal at turn 12, and we are. The actions after that are allowed but not necessary. But the sequence must be exactly H=2 actions.\n\nSo we choose the simplest: S at turn 12.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=2. But is there a sequence with H=1? Only if we are at the goal at turn 11, which we are not.\n\nSo H=2 is minimal.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 8 at turn 11: is it possible that the car covers 0 at turn 11? No, as calculated.\n\nWhat if there was a car on freeway 8 that covers 0 at turn 11? Then we would have to avoid by moving down or staying. But in this case, we don't.\n\nSo the above is safe.\n\nOne more thing: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". At turn 11, we are on freeway 8 and it's safe. At turn 12, we are on freeway 9? No, we are above freeway 8, so no freeway -> safe.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn 11. The goal is to reach (0, 9) as quickly as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Initial Position (Turn 11)**: The player is at y = 8.\n- **Goal Position**: (0, 9), which is above the freeways (y = 9 has no cars).\n- **Car on Freeway 8 at Turn 11**:  \n  The car is right-moving with head = 96, tail = 49, speed = 48.  \n  Span at turn 11: [49, 96] (since right-moving: [tail, head]).  \n  0 is not in [49, 96], so no collision at turn 11.\n- **Action Plan**:  \n  - At turn 11, move up (U) to reach y = 9 at turn 12.  \n    - Collision check at turn 11: Player is on freeway 8, car span [49, 96] does not include 0 → safe.  \n  - At turn 12, the player is at y = 9 (goal). Since y = 9 has no freeway, no collision is possible. An action is still required for the sequence of length H = 2. The safest action is to stay (S) to remain at y = 9.\n\n### Minimal Turns (H):\n- The player reaches (0, 9) at turn 12, which is turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 11 + H - 1\\).  \n  Solving: \\(11 + H - 1 = 12\\) gives \\(H = 2\\).  \n  This is minimal, as the player cannot reach y = 9 by turn 11 (initial position is y = 8).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 11**: U (move up to y = 9 at turn 12).  \n- **Turn 12**: S (stay at y = 9; no collision possible).  \n\nThe sequence ensures the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 12 (turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 12\\)) in minimal turns, avoiding all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: S\n}",
