        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 4, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions.\n\nImportant: \n- The grid has vertical axis y=0 to y=9. The player moves on the y-axis (vertical) and the cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8 (each freeway is a horizontal line at that y-coordinate).\n- The player's position at turn T is (0, y_T). We start at (0,0) at turn 4, and we want to get to (0,9) at some turn (turn 4+H-1).\n- The player can move up (U: y increases by 1), down (D: y decreases by 1), or stay (S: y stays). The y is clamped between 0 and 9.\n\nCar dynamics:\n- Each car has a span (a contiguous interval) on the x-axis. The collision condition is: at turn T, if the player is at freeway y_T (meaning the player is at (0, y_T)), then we check the cars on freeway y_T. Collision occurs if the player's x (which is always 0) is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNote: The update for cars is linear with time. For a car at turn t1 (current turn) with head h, tail tau, and speed s, and direction (left or right):\n  - Left-moving: the entire car moves left (negative x direction). So at time T (>= t1), the span becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] (note: since it's left, the head is the rightmost point? Actually, the description says: for left-moving, the span at t1 is [h, tau] and then at T it becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So if h > tau, then the car is from h (right) to tau (left). But note: the description says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and then moves to [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. So if the car is moving left, the entire segment shifts left.\n\n  Similarly, right-moving: at t1, span is [tau, h] (so tau is the left end and h the right end) and then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the representation in the table is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). We must interpret:\n\nFor left-moving cars: \n  - The head is the rightmost point? Because when moving left, the head (front) would be on the right? But the description says: for left-moving, the span is [h, tau] and then becomes [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. So if h > tau, then the car extends from tau to h (with tau < h). Then moving left, both endpoints decrease.\n\nFor right-moving:\n  - The span is [tau, h] meaning tau is the left end and h the right end? Then moving right, both increase.\n\nHowever, the table gives for each car: (head, tail, direction, speed). So we need to interpret:\n\n- For left-moving: head is the right end? and tail the left end? But the representation is (h, tau) and the span is [h, tau]. But if the car is moving left, then the head (front) is at the right, so h should be the rightmost and tau the leftmost? But then if h is the right end, and tau the left end, then h > tau? But the table shows for left-moving: (48,83) ... wait, 48 and 83? That would imply h=48, tau=83? Then 48 < 83, so the span [48,83] is from 48 to 83? But then if it's left-moving, the car moves left, so at T, [48 - s*(T-t1), 83 - s*(T-t1)].\n\nWait, but 48 to 83 is 36 units? Actually, the length of the car is |h - tau|? But note: the representation might have h and tau in any order? The problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and then moves to [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. So if h=48 and tau=83, then the car is from 48 to 83? That's a car of length 35? But then moving left, the entire segment shifts left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: the span is [tau, h] meaning the car goes from tau to h? So if tau=48 and h=83, then it's from 48 to 83? But the table gives (head, tail). So in the table, for a right-moving car, the first number is head? and the second tail? But the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\". \n\nSo in the table, the meaning is:\n  For a car: (head, tail, direction, speed)\n  Then:\n    if direction is left: the car's span at t1 is [head, tail]? But if head=48 and tail=83, then the car is from 48 to 83? That's a car of length 35? Then when moving left, the entire segment moves left.\n\n  if direction is right: the car's span at t1 is [tail, head]? So if we have (head, tail) = (48,37) for a right-moving car, then the span is [37,48]? \n\nBut wait, the table for freeway 3 has: (48,37,right,12) -> so head=48, tail=37? Then the span is [tail, head] = [37,48]. \n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 has: (0,-11,right,6) -> so head=0, tail=-11? Then span is [-11,0].\n\nSo to summarize: \n  For a left-moving car: span = [head, tail] (with head and tail as given) and then at T: [head - s*(T-t1), tail - s*(T-t1)]\n  For a right-moving car: span = [tail, head] and then at T: [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the head and tail might be given such that for a left-moving car, head should be greater than tail? But in the table, for freeway1: (48,83,left,36) -> head=48, tail=83 -> so head < tail? Then the car is from 48 to 83? That's a positive length? But when we move left, both numbers decrease. \n\nSimilarly, for freeway3: the first car is (48,37,right,12) -> head=48, tail=37 -> then the span is [37,48] (so from 37 to 48) and when moving right, it becomes [37+12*dt, 48+12*dt].\n\nWe are at turn t1 = 4. We are going to simulate turns starting from t=4.\n\nThe player starts at y=0. We need to get to y=9. The minimal number of turns in terms of vertical moves: we must go up 9 units. Since we can only move one step at a time, the minimal H in terms of moves is 9 (if we move up every turn). But we might have to wait (use S or even D) to avoid collisions, so H might be more.\n\nWe must avoid being at a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway whose span at turn T includes 0.\n\nNote: when we move, we are at the new y at the next turn. Specifically:\n  At turn T, we are at y_T. Then we choose an action a_T which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + delta.\n  Therefore, at turn T, we are on freeway y_T (if y_T is between 1 and 8) and we check the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant: if we move at turn T from y_T to y_{T+1} (which is different), then at turn T we are only on freeway y_T (so we only check the cars on y_T at turn T). At turn T+1, we are on freeway y_{T+1} (if it's between 1 and 8) and we check the cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nSo we can avoid a freeway by not being on it at the turn when a car is present at x=0.\n\nOur plan: we need to simulate the future positions of the cars on each freeway at each future turn and check if being on that freeway at that turn would cause a collision.\n\nWe are going to compute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each turn T (>=4) the set of T for which there is a car on freeway k at turn T such that 0 is in the span of that car.\n\nBut note: each freeway has multiple cars. We have to check every car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe are at turn 4. For each freeway k, we have a list of cars. For each car, we can compute the span at any turn T.\n\nLet dt = T - 4.\n\nFor freeway k, we have a list of cars: each car is (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor a left-moving car (d='left'):\n  span at T: [head - s*dt, tail - s*dt]\n\nFor a right-moving car (d='right'):\n  span at T: [tail + s*dt, head + s*dt]\n\nThen, collision on freeway k at turn T if there exists at least one car on freeway k such that:\n  0 is in [a, b] (the span at T) for that car.\n\nWe need to avoid being on freeway k at turn T if there is a collision.\n\nWe are going to compute the \"danger\" intervals for each freeway: the set of turns T at which freeway k is dangerous (i.e., 0 is in some car's span).\n\nBut note: we are only concerned with the time when we might be on that freeway. Since we are going to start at turn 4 at y=0, and we are going to move upward, we will be on freeways 1,2,...,8 at some turns.\n\nWe need to plan a path: a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves us from y=0 at turn4 to y=9 at some turn, without being on a freeway k at a turn T when freeway k is dangerous at T.\n\nNote: we can also move down? But we start at 0 and need to go to 9, so moving down at 0 will stay at 0 (since y in [0,9]). So moving down at 0 is equivalent to staying? Actually, at y=0, if we do D, then y_{next} = max(0, 0-1)=0. Similarly at y=9, U will stay at 9. So we can use S to wait.\n\nWe want minimal H (number of turns). The minimal H without any cars would be 9 (9 moves up). But with cars, we might have to wait.\n\nWe are going to simulate the future turns and check for each freeway at each turn the danger.\n\nFirst, let's list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (48, 83, left, 36)\n  Left-moving: span at T: [48 - 36*(T-4), 83 - 36*(T-4)]\n  We require 0 in [48-36*(T-4), 83-36*(T-4)]\n  => 48 - 36*(T-4) <= 0 <= 83 - 36*(T-4)\n\n  Solve:\n    Lower bound: 48 - 36*(T-4) <= 0  => 36*(T-4) >= 48 => T-4 >= 48/36 = 4/3 => T-4 >= 2 (since T is integer, and 4/3≈1.33 -> so T-4>=2 -> T>=6)\n    Upper bound: 0 <= 83 - 36*(T-4) => 36*(T-4) <= 83 => T-4 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 => T-4 <= 2 -> T<=6\n\n  So T>=6 and T<=6 -> only at T=6.\n\n  Therefore, freeway 1 is dangerous only at T=6.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway1: (48,83,left,36) -> dangerous only at T=6.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: \n  Car1: (48,37,right,12) -> right-moving: span at T: [37 + 12*(T-4), 48 + 12*(T-4)]\n      We require 0 in [37+12*(T-4), 48+12*(T-4)]\n      => 37+12*(T-4) <= 0 <= 48+12*(T-4)\n      Lower: 37+12*(T-4) <=0 -> 12*(T-4) <= -37 -> T-4 <= -37/12 ≈ -3.08 -> impossible (since T>=4, T-4>=0). So never.\n\n  Car2: (12,1,right,12) -> [1+12*(T-4), 12+12*(T-4)]\n      We require: 1+12*(T-4) <=0<=12+12*(T-4)\n      Lower: 1+12*(T-4)<=0 -> 12*(T-4)<=-1 -> T-4<=-1/12 -> impossible.\n\n  Car3: (-24,-35,right,12) -> [-35+12*(T-4), -24+12*(T-4)]\n      We require: -35+12*(T-4) <=0<= -24+12*(T-4)\n      Left: -35+12*(T-4) <=0 -> 12*(T-4)<=35 -> T-4<=35/12≈2.916 -> T<=6 (since T integer, T-4<=2 -> T<=6)\n      Right: 0<= -24+12*(T-4) -> 12*(T-4)>=24 -> T-4>=2 -> T>=6\n      So T=6.\n\n  Therefore, freeway3 is dangerous at T=6.\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway3? \n  The table says: same cars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) -> so same as freeway3: dangerous at T=6.\n\nFreeway5: same as freeway3: dangerous at T=6.\n\nFreeway6: one car: (48,37,right,6) -> [37+6*(T-4), 48+6*(T-4)]\n  We require: 37+6*(T-4) <=0<=48+6*(T-4)\n  Lower: 37+6*(T-4)<=0 -> 6*(T-4)<=-37 -> impossible. So safe.\n\nFreeway7: one car: (48,37,right,6) -> same as freeway6: safe.\n\nFreeway8: two cars:\n  Car1: (48,37,right,6) -> safe (as above).\n  Car2: (0,-11,right,6) -> [-11+6*(T-4), 0+6*(T-4)] = [-11+6*(T-4), 6*(T-4)]\n      We require: -11+6*(T-4) <=0<=6*(T-4)\n      The right part: 0<=6*(T-4) -> T-4>=0 -> always true for T>=4.\n      The left part: -11+6*(T-4)<=0 -> 6*(T-4)<=11 -> T-4<=11/6≈1.833 -> T<=5 (since T integer: T-4=0,1 -> T=4,5)\n      So for T=4 and T=5, the car is at [-11,0] at T=4? \n          T=4: [-11+0, 0] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Yes, because the interval is [-11,0] -> includes 0.\n      T=5: [-11+6*1, 0+6] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6]? Yes.\n\n      T=6: [-11+12, 12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12].\n\n      So dangerous at T=4 and T=5.\n\nSummary of dangerous freeways at turns:\n\nTurn T | Dangerous freeways\nT=4: freeway8\nT=5: freeway8\nT=6: freeway1, freeway2, freeway3, freeway4, freeway5\nT>=7: none? (we have freeway8 safe from T=6 onward, and the others only at T=6)\n\nBut note: freeway6 and 7 are always safe.\n\nWe are at turn T=4, at y=0. We must avoid being on freeway8 at T=4 and T=5? But note: we start at y=0 (which is not a freeway? the freeways are y=1..8). So at T=4, we are at y=0 -> safe (because we are not on any freeway that has cars). Similarly, at T=4, freeway8 is dangerous, but we are not on freeway8 (we are at y=0).\n\nSo the danger is only when we are on the freeway (y from 1 to 8) at a dangerous turn.\n\nWe need to traverse from y=0 to y=9. We must pass through freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe are at turn4: y4=0.\n\nWe want to choose actions for t=4,5,6,... until we get to y=9.\n\nWe want minimal H. The minimal path without obstacles would be: \n  Turn4: U -> y=1 at turn5\n  Turn5: U -> y=2 at turn6\n  Turn6: U -> y=3 at turn7\n  ... until turn12: y=8 -> then turn13: U -> y=9 (so H=9, from turn4 to turn12, 9 moves? Actually, we start at turn4 at y0=0, and after H turns we are at turn4+H-1? \n\nBut note: the sequence of actions is from t=4 to t=4+H-1, and at turn4+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\nAt turn4 (current) we are at y=0. Then we take an action at turn4 which moves us to y1 at turn5, then action at turn5 to y2 at turn6, ... until at turn4+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\nSo the minimal H without obstacles is 9: we need 9 moves (each U) to go from 0 to 9.\n\nBut let's check if that path is safe:\n\n  Turn4: at y=0 -> safe (not on freeway). Then we do U -> so at turn5: y=1.\n      Turn5: we are at freeway1 at turn5. Is freeway1 dangerous at T=5? We found freeway1 dangerous only at T=6 -> so safe.\n\n  Turn5: we do U -> at turn6: y=2.\n      Turn6: we are at freeway2 at turn6. But freeway2 is dangerous at T=6 -> collision!\n\nSo we cannot do two Ups in a row? We must avoid being on freeway2 at turn6.\n\nWe must wait at some point.\n\nPossible plan:\n\nWe start at turn4: y=0. We cannot go to freeway8 at T=4 and T=5? But we are not going to freeway8 until we are at y=8, which would be later.\n\nThe danger at T=6 is on freeways 1,2,3,4,5. So we must avoid being on freeways 1 to 5 at turn6.\n\nBut note: at turn6, we are at the freeway corresponding to our y at turn6.\n\nWe are at turn4: y=0.\n\nWe have to plan the next moves.\n\nOption: wait at y=0 for one turn? Then:\n  Turn4: S (stay) -> then at turn5: y=0 (still safe, since not on freeway).\n  Then turn5: U -> at turn6: y=1 (freeway1 at turn6) -> but freeway1 is dangerous at turn6 -> collision.\n\nAlternatively, turn4: U -> at turn5: y=1 (freeway1 at turn5 -> safe because freeway1 is only dangerous at turn6).\n  Then turn5: we cannot go to y=2 at turn6 because freeway2 is dangerous at turn6. So we must not be on freeway2 at turn6. So at turn5, we can choose:\n      Option1: S at turn5: then at turn6: y=1 (freeway1) -> dangerous at turn6? freeway1 is dangerous at turn6 -> collision.\n      Option2: D at turn5: then at turn6: y=0 -> safe (not on freeway). Then we have to go up again later.\n\nSo after turn4: U -> turn5: y=1, then turn5: D -> turn6: y=0. Then we are safe at turn6. Then we can proceed.\n\nBut then we have lost two moves: we went up and then down. Now we are at y=0 at turn6. Then we need to go up to 9: 9 moves. So total turns: 2 (for the first two moves) + 9 = 11? But note: we are at turn6 at y=0, then we do 9 Ups: from turn6 to turn14 (9 actions: turns6 to14) and at turn14 we are at y=9. So total H=11? (from turn4 to turn14: 11 actions? Actually, the sequence of actions: 11 actions: a4, a5, ... a14? and at turn14 we are at y=9? Then H=11.\n\nBut we can do better? Maybe we can wait at a safe freeway? The only safe freeways at turn6 are freeways 6,7,8? But at turn6 we are at y=0. How to get to freeway6 (y=6) at turn6? We would need 6 moves? But we only have 2 moves (from turn4 to turn6) -> impossible.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeways 1-5 at turn6.\n\nWe can try to be above freeway5 at turn6? But we start at y=0. To be at y=6 at turn6, we would have to go up 6 steps in 2 moves: impossible (max we can go up 2 steps: one per move). So we cannot be at y=6 at turn6.\n\nTherefore, the only safe place at turn6 is y=0 (or possibly y=9, but that's too high? we start at 0 and 9 is 9 steps). Or if we are at y>=6, but we cannot reach that in two moves.\n\nSo the only safe place at turn6 is y=0. \n\nSo we must be at y=0 at turn6.\n\nHow?\n  Option1: \n      Turn4: S -> y=0 at turn5.\n      Turn5: S -> y=0 at turn6. -> safe at turn6.\n      Then at turn6: we start going up.\n\n  Option2:\n      Turn4: U -> y=1 at turn5.\n      Turn5: D -> y=0 at turn6.\n\nBoth options use two moves and end at y=0 at turn6.\n\nThen from turn6 onward, we can go up without any danger? Because after turn6, the only danger we found was at T=4,5,6. For T>=7, we found no danger? \n\nBut let's check:\n\nWe have freeways 1-8. We computed:\n  Freeway1: dangerous only at T=6.\n  Freeway2: only T=6.\n  Freeway3: only T=6.\n  Freeway4: only T=6.\n  Freeway5: only T=6.\n  Freeway6: safe always.\n  Freeway7: safe always.\n  Freeway8: dangerous at T=4 and T=5, but safe at T=6 and beyond.\n\nSo for T>=7, no freeway is dangerous.\n\nTherefore, from turn6 (at y=0) we can do 9 consecutive Ups and reach y=9 at turn6+9 = turn15.\n\nBut total actions: \n  Option1: \n      Turn4: S\n      Turn5: S\n      Then turns6 to14: 9 Ups -> that's 2 + 9 = 11 actions.\n\n  Option2:\n      Turn4: U\n      Turn5: D\n      Then turns6 to14: 9 Ups -> also 11 actions.\n\nBut note: we are at turn4. We do an action at turn4, then turn5, then turns6 to14 (9 actions) -> total 11 actions? Then the last action is at turn14? And at turn14 we are at y=9? \n\nActually, the sequence:\n\n  Turn4: S -> then at turn5: y=0\n  Turn5: S -> at turn6: y=0\n  Turn6: U -> at turn7: y=1\n  Turn7: U -> at turn8: y=2\n  ...\n  Turn14: U -> at turn15: y=9? \n\nBut we are required to be at y=9 at turn4+H-1. So if we start at turn4, and take H actions (at turns4,5,...,4+H-1) and then at the end of these actions we are at turn4+H-1 and we want y_{4+H-1}=9.\n\nIn this plan: \n  Action at turn4: S -> turn5: y=0\n  Action at turn5: S -> turn6: y=0\n  Action at turn6: U -> turn7: y=1\n  Action at turn7: U -> turn8: y=2\n  Action at turn8: U -> turn9: y=3\n  Action at turn9: U -> turn10: y=4\n  Action at turn10: U -> turn11: y=5\n  Action at turn11: U -> turn12: y=6\n  Action at turn12: U -> turn13: y=7\n  Action at turn13: U -> turn14: y=8\n  Action at turn14: U -> turn15: y=9\n\nSo we have 11 actions (turns4 to14) and at turn15 we are at y=9? But the last action is at turn14, and after that we are at turn15. However, the problem says: we take actions from t= t1 to t1+H-1 (so H actions) and at the next state (which is after the last action) we are at the position. So the position after H actions is at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: we are at turn t1 at the start. Then we take an action at t1, which moves us to turn t1+1. Then ... until the last action at t1+H-1, which moves us to turn t1+H. And we require that at turn t1+H, we are at (0,9).\n\nSo in the above, we have H=11 actions: at turns4,5,...,14. Then at turn4+11 = turn15, we are at y=9. That matches.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nWe must be at y=9 at turn14. We need to go from y=0 to y=9 in 10 moves? That requires 9 Ups and 1 extra move. The extra move could be a wait? But we have to avoid the dangers.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeways 1-5 at turn6. Also, we must avoid freeway8 at turn4 and turn5? But we are not on freeway8 until we get to y=8.\n\nWe start at y=0 at turn4.\n\nWe have to be at y=9 at turn14.\n\nWe must pass through each freeway. The danger at T=6 forces us to be at y=0 at T=6? Or we could be at y>=6? But we cannot reach y>=6 at T=6 because we start at y=0 at T=4 and we can only move 2 steps in 2 moves: maximum y=2 at T=6.\n\nBut y=0,1,2 at T=6: \n  y=0: safe (not on freeway).\n  y=1: freeway1 -> dangerous at T=6.\n  y=2: freeway2 -> dangerous at T=6.\n\nSo at T=6, we must be at y=0.\n\nTherefore, the only safe option at T=6 is y=0.\n\nSo we must have:\n  T=4: y=0\n  T=5: y=0 or y=1? But if we go up at T=4, then T=5: y=1 -> then at T=5 we are on freeway1? and freeway1 is not dangerous at T=5? Then at T=5, we are safe. But then at T=5 we must choose an action that gets us to y=0 at T=6? So we do D at T=5: then T=6: y=0.\n\nBut then we have used two moves: one U and one D, and we are back at 0 at T=6.\n\nThen we have 8 moves left (from T=6 to T=13) to go from y=0 to y=9? That requires 9 moves? So we need 2 + 9 = 11 moves.\n\nAlternatively, we could wait at T=4 and T=5: both S, then at T=6: y=0. Then 9 Ups: 2+9=11.\n\nIs there a way to get past the freeway8 danger? But freeway8 is only dangerous at T=4 and T=5. We are not on freeway8 at T=4 or T=5 because we are at y=0 at T=4 and T=5. Then at T=6 and beyond, freeway8 is safe.\n\nSo we don't have to worry about freeway8.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, we have two options for the first two moves:\n\nOption A:\n  Turn4: S\n  Turn5: S\n  Then 9 Ups: turns6 to14.\n\nOption B:\n  Turn4: U\n  Turn5: D\n  Then 9 Ups: turns6 to14.\n\nBoth are 11 moves. We can choose either.\n\nBut note: at T=5 in option B: we are at y=1 (freeway1) at T=5. Is that safe? We computed freeway1 dangerous only at T=6. So yes, safe.\n\nSimilarly, in option A, we are at y=0 at T=5, safe.\n\nSo both are safe.\n\nWe choose the shortest? They are the same length.\n\nBut perhaps we can check if we can do it in 10? Let's see:\n\nWe must be at y=0 at T=6. Then from T=6 to T=14 (8 moves) we can only go up 8 steps? Then we would be at y=8 at T=14. Then we need one more move to get to y=9 at T=15? So that would be 11 moves again.\n\nAlternatively, if we try to be at y=1 at T=6? But that's dangerous. Or y=2? dangerous. So no.\n\nWhat if we go down? But we start at y=0, we cannot go below 0.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at T=6.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nWe'll write the sequence.\n\nLet me choose option B:\n\nTurn4: U -> so at turn5: y=1 (safe, because freeway1 at T=5 is safe).\nTurn5: D -> at turn6: y=0 (safe).\nThen we do 9 Ups:\n\nTurn6: U -> turn7: y=1\nTurn7: U -> turn8: y=2\nTurn8: U -> turn9: y=3\nTurn9: U -> turn10: y=4\nTurn10: U -> turn11: y=5\nTurn11: U -> turn12: y=6\nTurn12: U -> turn13: y=7\nTurn13: U -> turn14: y=8\nTurn14: U -> turn15: y=9\n\nSo the actions from turn4 to turn14 (11 actions):\n\nTurn4: U\nTurn5: D\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: U\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions for t = t1 + t for t=0 to H-1. Here t1=4, and H=11, so t from 0 to 10? \n\nActually, the actions are for turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nSo we have 11 actions: for turn4, turn5, ..., turn14.\n\nWe write:\n\nTurn4: U\nTurn5: D\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: U\n\nBut we can also do option A:\n\nTurn4: S\nTurn5: S\nTurn6: U\n... same as above.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify a preference, we can choose either.\n\nI'll choose option B (U then D) because it might be more interesting? Or we can choose option A (S then S) to avoid moving unnecessarily.\n\nBut both are valid.\n\nLet me check option A:\n\nTurn4: S -> at turn5: y=0 (safe)\nTurn5: S -> at turn6: y=0 (safe)\nThen same Ups.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer one over the other? Not really.\n\nBut note: in option B, we went to y=1 at turn5 and then back to 0. We might be concerned about freeway1 at turn5? But we already computed freeway1 only dangerous at turn6. So safe.\n\nSo I'll write option B.\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway1 at turn5:\n\nFreeway1: car: (48,83,left,36) at turn5 (dt=1): \n  span = [48-36*1, 83-36*1] = [12,47] -> 0 is not in [12,47] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn6: [48-36*2, 83-36*2] = [48-72,83-72] = [-24,11] -> 0 is in [-24,11] -> dangerous.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the sequence:\n\nTurn4: U\nTurn5: D\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: U\n\nBut wait: at turn14: we do U and then at turn15 we are at y=9. And we have taken 11 actions (turns4 to14) and at turn15 we are at (0,9). That's correct.\n\nBut the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H\". We have H=11.\n\nIs there a way with H=10? We argued no because we must be at y=0 at turn6 and then we need 9 moves to go from 0 to 9. So 2 (to get to 0 at turn6) + 9 = 11.\n\nBut what if we go faster? We can only move one per turn. So no.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn4: U\nTurn5: D\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: U\n}\n\nBut note: the current turn is t1=4, so we write:\n\nTurn4: U\nTurn5: D\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: U\n\nWe can write it as:\n\nTurn4: U\nTurn5: D\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: U\n\nBut to save space? The problem doesn't specify, so we write all.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\nTurn4: U\nTurn5: D\nTurn6 to Turn14: U   (but the problem requires each turn explicitly)\n\nSo we write each.\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn14, and after that we are at turn15 at y=9.\n\nThis is the minimal H=11.\n\nBut wait, is there a way to get to y=9 earlier? For example, if we could be at y=9 at turn14? That would require 10 moves? But we need to be at y=0 at turn6, then we have 8 moves (turn6 to turn13) to go from 0 to 9: that's 9 moves? So we would be at y=9 at turn15. \n\nAlternatively, if we can avoid the wait? But we must avoid freeways1-5 at turn6. The only safe y at turn6 is 0. So we must.\n\nTherefore, we are confident.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The analysis shows that the minimal number of turns \\(H = 11\\).\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Car Hazards**:\n  - Freeways 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are hazardous at turn \\(T = 6\\) (i.e., any position on these freeways at turn 6 results in a collision).\n  - Freeway 8 is hazardous at turns \\(T = 4\\) and \\(T = 5\\).\n  - Freeways 6 and 7 are safe at all turns.\n  - No hazards exist for \\(T \\geq 7\\).\n\n- **Path Constraints**:\n  - At turn 6 (\\(T = 6\\)), the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) to avoid collisions (since \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\) are hazardous, and \\(y \\geq 6\\) is unreachable from \\(y = 0\\) in 2 turns).\n  - Starting at \\(y = 0\\) (turn 4), the player must use the first two actions to ensure \\(y = 0\\) at turn 6.\n  - From turn 6 onward, the player can move upward safely to \\(y = 9\\) in 9 turns, as no hazards exist for \\(T \\geq 7\\).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 4 (\\(t_1\\)):** Move up (U) to \\(y = 1\\).  \n  - At turn 5: Position is (0, 1). Freeway 1 at turn 5 is safe (car span: [48 - 36×1, 83 - 36×1] = [12, 47], 0 ∉ [12, 47]).\n- **Turn 5:** Move down (D) to \\(y = 0\\).  \n  - At turn 6: Position is (0, 0). Safe (not on freeway 1–8).\n- **Turns 6–14:** Move up (U) consecutively to reach \\(y = 9\\).  \n  - At turn 15: Position is (0, 9), as required.\n\nThis sequence uses \\(H = 11\\) actions (turns 4 to 14), and the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 15.\n\n### Output:\n\\boxed{\nTurn4: U \\\\\nTurn5: D \\\\\nTurn6: U \\\\\nTurn7: U \\\\\nTurn8: U \\\\\nTurn9: U \\\\\nTurn10: U \\\\\nTurn11: U \\\\\nTurn12: U \\\\\nTurn13: U \\\\\nTurn14: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 6. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes linearly with time based on speed and direction.\n\nImportant note: when you move to a new y at turn T, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, you are on y_T, and if you move, at turn T+1 you are on y_{T+1}. So collision is checked based on where you are at the beginning of the turn, I think.\n\nLet me read carefully: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThis means that at turn T, you are only affected by cars on your current row y_T. If you move up or down, you change rows at the end of the turn, so for the next turn.\n\nAlso, since the grid is vertical, y=0 to 9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars there. y=0 is the starting point, y=9 is the goal.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,0), which is y=0, and we need to reach (0,9), y=9.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 have no cars, we only need to worry about y=1 to 8 when we are on those rows.\n\nNow, the car states are given for each freeway k (which I assume is y=k).\n\nLet me list the cars for each y:\n\nFor y=1: one car: head h=-24, tail τ=11, direction left, speed 36. Since left-moving, span at time t is [h - s(t - t_1), τ - s(t - t_1)], with t_1=6.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nt_1=6 is the current turn.\n\nI need to find actions from t=6 onwards.\n\nLet me denote the turns starting from t=6.\n\nSet τ = t - t_1, so at τ=0, turn t=6, player at y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn, say τ=H, so y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, the position should be (0,9).\n\nAfter action a_{t}, we get y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, we choose action a_t, then we move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn based on y_t and the cars on that row at that turn.\n\nFor turn T, collision if 0 in span of some car on y_T at time T.\n\nSince the player is at x=0 always, I think, since it's (0,y), so we care about whether x=0 is occupied by a car on row y at time T.\n\nNow, for each freeway and each car, I need to compute when x=0 is covered by the car span at time t.\n\nSince the car moves linearly, the position changes with time.\n\nLet me define the span as a function of time.\n\nFor a car on row k, with initial head h, tail τ at t_1=6, direction d, speed s.\n\nThen at time t, the span is:\n\nIf left-moving (d=left): head position at t: h - s*(t - 6)\n\nTail position at t: τ - s*(t - 6)\n\nSince it's left-moving, head is left, tail is right? In the description, for left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ], and since left-moving, h should be the left end? Let's see.\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIf h and τ are positions, and it's [h, τ], with h and τ such that for left-moving, as time increases, both decrease.\n\nIn the initial state, for y=1, h=-24, τ=11, left-moving. So at t=6, the car spans from x=-24 to x=11? But since it's left-moving, and [h,τ] with h=-24, τ=11, so from left to right, x from -24 to 11, but head is at h, which is left, I think.\n\nIn the notation, \"head is at h, tail is at τ\", and for left-moving, head is left, tail is right, so span [h, τ] from low to high x if h < τ.\n\nIn this case h=-24, τ=11, so min x = -24, max x = 11, so it covers from -24 to 11.\n\nThen at time T, [h - s(T-6), τ - s(T-6)] = [-24 -36(T-6), 11 -36(T-6)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nFor right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end? Let's see the example.\n\nFor y=3, cars: (-48, -59, right, 12), but -48 and -59, if [τ, h], and τ=-48, h=-59? But -48 > -59, so if [τ, h] with τ=-48, h=-59, then min x = h = -59, max x = τ = -48? That might be messy.\n\nIn the table, for y=3: \"(-48, -59, right, 12)\", and it says (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nBut for right-moving, the span is given as [τ, h] at t_1, and for this car, h=-48? Head is -48, tail is -59? That seems odd.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nThen for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\"\n\nIn the car state, for y=3: \"(-48, -59, right, 12)\", so h = -48, τ = -59, d=right.\n\nThen Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? But [τ, h] with τ=-59, h=-48, so min x = τ = -59, max x = h = -48.\n\nThen at time T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-59 +12(T-6), -48 +12(T-6)]\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nFor the car (36, 25, right, 12) on y=3, h=36, τ=25, d=right, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [25, 36], min x=25, max x=36.\n\nAt T, [25 +12(T-6), 36 +12(T-6)]\n\nAnd (0, -11, right, 12), h=0, τ=-11, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-11, 0], so at x from -11 to 0.\n\nAt T, [-11 +12(T-6), 0 +12(T-6)] = [-11 +12(T-6), 12(T-6)]\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nNow, collision on row k at time t if for some car on that row, the span includes 0 at time t.\n\nThat is, min_x(t) <= 0 <= max_x(t) for that car.\n\nSince the player is at x=0.\n\nNow, we start at t=6, y=0, which is safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, safe.\n\nBut we have to pass through y=1 to 8, each with cars moving.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since we need to go from y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 moves up, but we can stay or move down, but that would increase turns, so minimal H should be at least 9, but we might need to wait to avoid cars, so H could be more.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so we should go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nNow, since moving to a new row only happens at the end of the turn, and collision is based on current row, we need to ensure that when we are on a row with cars, at that turn, x=0 is not covered.\n\nAlso, when we move, we are not on the new row until next turn.\n\nNow, let's list for each row k from 1 to 8, the cars and when x=0 is covered.\n\nI need to find for each time t, for each row, if there is a car covering x=0.\n\nBut since we care about when the player is on that row, we can find for each row the times when it is safe to be there, i.e., no car covers x=0 at that time.\n\nThen the player needs to be on each row at a safe time when moving through.\n\nBut the player can stay on a row or move, so we need a path through the rows with times.\n\nSince we start at t=6, y=0, and want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nLet me define the safe times for each row.\n\nFirst, row y=1:\n\nCar: left-moving, h=-24, τ=11, s=36\n\nSpan at time t: [ -24 -36(t-6) , 11 -36(t-6) ]\n\nx=0 covered if min <= 0 <= max\n\nSo -24 -36(t-6) <= 0 <= 11 -36(t-6)\n\nSolve the inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: -24 -36(t-6) <= 0 => -36(t-6) <= 24 => multiply both sides by -1, reverse inequality: 36(t-6) >= -24, but 36(t-6) is always >= something, better:\n\n-24 -36(t-6) <= 0 => -36(t-6) <= 24\n\nDivide both sides by -36, reverse inequality: t-6 >= -24/36? Let's compute:\n\n-36(t-6) <= 24\n\nDivide both sides by -36, so inequality reverses: t-6 >= 24 / (-36) ? No\n\n-36(t-6) <= 24\n\nDivide both sides by -36, which is negative, so inequality reverses:\n\nt-6 >= 24 / (-36) = -24/36 = -2/3\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= 11 -36(t-6) => 36(t-6) <= 11 => t-6 <= 11/36\n\nSo we have t-6 >= -2/3 and t-6 <= 11/36\n\n-2/3 ≈ -0.666, 11/36 ≈ 0.3056\n\nSo t-6 between -0.666 and 0.3056, so t between 6 - 0.666 = 5.333 and 6 + 0.3056 = 6.3056\n\nSince t is integer turn, t=6 only? t from 5.333 to 6.3056, so for integer t, t=6.\n\nAt t=6, t-6=0, min x = -24, max x=11, so 0 is between -24 and 11, yes covered.\n\nFor t=5, t-6=-1, min x = -24 -36(-1) = -24 +36=12, max x=11 -36(-1)=11+36=47, so [12,47], 0 not in [12,47], so not covered.\n\nSimilarly t=7, t-6=1, min x = -24-36(1)= -60, max x=11-36= -25, so [-60,-25], 0 not in it.\n\nSo only at t=6, x=0 is covered on row y=1.\n\nFor other t, it is safe.\n\nBut t is integer, so for row y=1, unsafe only at t=6.\n\nNow, similarly for other rows.\n\nRow y=2: same as y=1, car (-24,11,left,36), so same thing, unsafe only at t=6.\n\nNow row y=3: has three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48, -59, right, 12) but head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48] since min τ, max h.\n\nAt time t: [ -59 +12(t-6) , -48 +12(t-6) ]\n\nx=0 covered if -59 +12(t-6) <= 0 <= -48 +12(t-6)\n\nFirst, -59 +12(t-6) <= 0 => 12(t-6) <= 59 => t-6 <= 59/12 ≈ 4.9167\n\nSecond, 0 <= -48 +12(t-6) => 48 <= 12(t-6) => t-6 >= 48/12 = 4\n\nSo t-6 between 4 and 4.9167, so t=10 or t=11? t-6 >=4 and <=4.9167, so t-6=4, since integer, t=10.\n\nt-6=4, t=10.\n\nAt t=10, min x = -59 +12(4) = -59 +48 = -11, max x = -48 +48=0, so [-11,0], 0 is included? max x=0, so 0 <=0 yes, covered.\n\nAt t=11, t-6=5, min x= -59+60=1, max x=-48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nt=9, t-6=3, min x=-59+36=-23, max x=-48+36=-12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only t=10 unsafe for this car.\n\nBut there are multiple cars.\n\nSecond car on y=3: (36,25,right,12) head h=36, tail τ=25, d=right\n\nSpan at t: [τ +12(t-6), h +12(t-6)] = [25 +12(t-6), 36 +12(t-6)]\n\nx=0 covered if 25 +12(t-6) <= 0 <= 36 +12(t-6)\n\nBut 25 +12(t-6) <=0, since 25>0 and 12(t-6) >= for t>=6, this is always positive for t>=6, so never <=0. Similarly, 36+12(t-6) >0, so 0 not <= min or max, min is at least 25>0, so 0 not covered, always safe for this car.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (0,-11,right,12) head h=0, tail τ=-11, d=right\n\nSpan at t: [τ +12(t-6), h +12(t-6)] = [-11 +12(t-6), 0 +12(t-6)] = [-11 +12(t-6), 12(t-6)]\n\nx=0 covered if min <=0 <= max\n\n-11 +12(t-6) <=0 and 0 <= 12(t-6)\n\nFirst: -11 +12(t-6) <=0 => 12(t-6) <=11 => t-6 <=11/12≈0.9167\n\nSecond: 0 <= 12(t-6) => t-6 >=0\n\nSo t-6 >=0 and t-6 <=0.9167, so t-6=0, t=6.\n\nAt t=6, min x = -11 +0 = -11, max x=0, so [-11,0], 0 covered.\n\nFor other t, not covered.\n\nSo for row y=3, unsafe when:\n\n- First car: unsafe at t=10\n\n- Second car: always safe\n\n- Third car: unsafe at t=6\n\nSo overall, unsafe at t=6 and t=10.\n\nSafe at other times.\n\nNow row y=4: same as y=3, cars: (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nSo same as y=3, unsafe at t=6 and t=10.\n\nRow y=5: same cars, unsafe at t=6 and t=10.\n\nNow row y=6: car (60,49,right,6) head h=60, tail τ=49, d=right\n\nSpan at t: [τ + s(t-6), h + s(t-6)] = [49 +6(t-6), 60 +6(t-6)]\n\nx=0 covered if 49 +6(t-6) <=0 <= 60 +6(t-6)\n\nBut 49 +6(t-6) >=49>0 for t>=6, so min x >0, 0 not covered, always safe.\n\nRow y=7: same car (60,49,right,6), same as y=6, always safe.\n\nRow y=8: two cars: (60,49,right,6) and (12,1,right,6)\n\nFirst car (60,49,right,6): as above, min x at t=6 is 49>0, so always safe, 0 not covered.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6) head h=12, tail τ=1, d=right\n\nSpan at t: [τ +6(t-6), h +6(t-6)] = [1 +6(t-6), 12 +6(t-6)]\n\nx=0 covered if 1 +6(t-6) <=0 <=12 +6(t-6)\n\nFirst: 1 +6(t-6) <=0 => 6(t-6) <= -1 => t-6 <= -1/6 ≈ -0.166, so t<=5.833, since t integer >=6? t>=6, this never true for t>=6.\n\nSecond: 0 <=12 +6(t-6), which for t>=6, always true since min 12.\n\nBut first inequality not hold, so 0 not covered, always safe for this car.\n\nThus for row y=8, both cars always safe, so no collision possible.\n\nSummary of unsafe times for each row:\n\n- y=1: unsafe at t=6 only\n\n- y=2: unsafe at t=6 only\n\n- y=3: unsafe at t=6 and t=10\n\n- y=4: unsafe at t=6 and t=10\n\n- y=5: unsafe at t=6 and t=10\n\n- y=6: always safe\n\n- y=7: always safe\n\n- y=8: always safe\n\ny=6,7,8 always safe.\n\nWe start at t=6, y=0.\n\nAt t=6, y=0 is safe, but if we go to y=1 at t=7? Let's plan the path.\n\nWe need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: if we go up every turn, from y=0 at t=6, after one up, at t=7 y=1, but y=1 is unsafe only at t=6, so at t=7 it is safe, since only unsafe at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 unsafe only at t=6, so at t=7 safe.\n\ny=3 unsafe at t=6 and t=10.\n\nAt t=7, y=3 should be safe? Let me confirm.\n\nFor y=3, unsafe at t=6 and t=10.\n\nAt t=7, t-6=1, for first car: min x= -59 +12(1)= -47, max x= -48+12= -36? Earlier for first car on y=3: [ -59 +12(t-6), -48 +12(t-6) ]\n\nAt t=7, t-6=1, min x= -59+12= -47, max x= -48+12= -36, [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [25+12(1),36+12(1)]=[37,48], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [-11+12(1), 12(1)] = [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo yes, safe at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, at t=10 unsafe.\n\nNow, y=4 and y=5 same.\n\ny=6,7,8 always safe.\n\nWe start at t=6, y=0.\n\nWe can move up immediately.\n\nAction at t=6: if we choose U, then y_{7} = y_6 +1 = 0+1=1, so at turn t=7, we are at y=1.\n\nAt t=7, y=1 is safe, as we saw.\n\nThen at t=7, we can choose U again, go to y=2 at t=8.\n\ny=2 unsafe only at t=6, so at t=8 safe.\n\nThen at t=8, U to y=3 at t=9.\n\ny=3 unsafe at t=6 and t=10, so at t=9, safe? t=9, t-6=3.\n\nFor y=3, first car: min x= -59 +12(3)= -59+36= -23, max x= -48+36= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [25+36,36+36]=[61,72], no\n\nThird car: [-11+36, 36]= [25,36], no. So safe.\n\nThen at t=9, we are at y=3, choose U, go to y=4 at t=10.\n\nNow at t=10, we are at y=4.\n\nBut y=4 is unsafe at t=10.\n\ny=4 has same cars as y=3, unsafe at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, on y=4, collision?\n\nLet's check: for y=4, at t=10, t-6=4.\n\nFirst car: min x= -59 +12(4)= -59+48= -11, max x= -48+48=0, so [-11,0], 0 covered, collision.\n\nYes, so at t=10, if on y=4, collision.\n\nSimilarly for y=3 at t=10, same.\n\nIn our path, at t=10, we would be on y=4 if we went up from y=3 at t=9.\n\nBut we need to avoid that.\n\nWe could stay or move down, but that might not help.\n\nSince y=3 is safe at t=9, we could stay on y=3 at t=9, so at t=9, choose S, then at t=10, still on y=3.\n\nBut y=3 unsafe at t=10, collision.\n\nIf we go to y=4 at t=10, also unsafe.\n\ny=5 unsafe at t=10.\n\nBut y=6 is always safe, but we are on y=3 at t=9.\n\nFrom y=3, we can go up to y=4, but at t=10 y=4 unsafe.\n\nWe need to delay so that we are not on y=3,4,5 at t=10.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 are always safe, we could go faster to higher rows.\n\nBut we start from y=0.\n\nAt t=6, we are at y=0.\n\nIf we go up at t=6 to y=1 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7 to y=2 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8 to y=3 at t=9.\n\nNow at t=9 on y=3.\n\nInstead of going up, we could go down, but that seems worse.\n\nOr stay.\n\nBut if we stay at t=9 on y=3, then at t=10 on y=3, unsafe.\n\nIf we go up to y=4 at t=10, unsafe.\n\nSo we need to not be on y=3,4,5 at t=10.\n\ny=3,4,5 all unsafe at t=10.\n\nAt t=9, we are on y=3.\n\nWe could, from y=3 at t=9, go down to y=2 at t=10.\n\nBut y=2 is unsafe only at t=6, so at t=10 should be safe.\n\ny=2: car same as y=1, only unsafe at t=6.\n\nAt t=10, min x = -24 -36(10-6) = -24 -144 = -168, max x=11-144= -133, negative, so 0 not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 safe at t=10.\n\nBut going down might not help progress.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 are safe, we can go directly to them.\n\nBut we need to pass through lower rows first.\n\nAnother idea: at t=6, instead of moving up immediately, we could stay or something, but y=0 is safe, and moving up is better.\n\nLet's list the times we can be on each row safely.\n\nFor y=1: safe for t !=6, i.e., t<6 or t>6, but since t>=6, safe for t>=7.\n\nSimilarly y=2: safe for t>=7.\n\ny=3: safe except t=6 and t=10, so safe for t=7,8,9,11,12,... but t=6 and t=10 unsafe.\n\nt=7,8,9 safe, t=10 unsafe, t=11 safe, etc.\n\nSimilarly for y=4 and y=5.\n\ny=6,7,8: always safe.\n\nNow, we start at t=6, y=0.\n\nWe can take action at t=6.\n\nOption: move up to y=1 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, on y=1, safe.\n\nThen move up to y=2 at t=8, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, on y=2, move up to y=3 at t=9, safe since t=9<10.\n\nNow at t=9, on y=3. We need to avoid being on y=3,4,5 at t=10.\n\nSo at t=9, we can move up to y=4, but then at t=10 on y=4, unsafe.\n\nOr stay on y=3 at t=10, unsafe.\n\nOr move down to y=2 at t=10.\n\ny=2 at t=10 is safe, as above.\n\nThen from there, we can go up again, but it will take more turns.\n\nFor example: at t=9 on y=3, choose D, go to y=2 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10 on y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=10, we can move up to y=3 at t=11.\n\ny=3 at t=11 is safe, since t=11>10.\n\nThen from y=3, go up to y=4 at t=12, and so on.\n\nBut this takes more turns.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 are safe, we can go to y=6 directly if possible.\n\nBut from y=3 at t=9, we could go up, but to y=4 at t=10 unsafe.\n\nUnless we can reach y=6 before t=10.\n\nBut at t=9 we are on y=3, to go to y=6, we need 3 more up moves, so at t=10 on y=4, t=11 on y=5, t=12 on y=6, but at t=10 and t=11, if on y=4 or y=5, unsafe at t=10? y=4 and y=5 unsafe only at t=10, but at t=11 they are safe.\n\ny=4 unsafe at t=10, but at t=11 safe.\n\nSimilarly y=5.\n\nBut at t=10, if we are on y=4, unsafe.\n\nIn the sequence: at t=9 on y=3.\n\nIf we go U at t=9, to y=4 at t=10, unsafe.\n\nIf we go S at t=9, stay on y=3 at t=10, unsafe.\n\nIf we go D at t=9, to y=2 at t=10, safe.\n\nThen at t=10 on y=2, we can go U to y=3 at t=11.\n\nAt t=11 on y=3, safe (since t=11 not 10).\n\nThen go U to y=4 at t=12, safe (y=4 safe at t=12).\n\nThen U to y=5 at t=13, safe.\n\nThen U to y=6 at t=14, safe, and so on to y=9.\n\nBut this is slow; we are at y=2 at t=10, then to y=3 at t=11, y=4 at t=12, y=5 at t=13, y=6 at t=14, y=7 at t=15, y=8 at t=16, y=9 at t=17.\n\nSo from start, t=6 y=0, to t=17 y=9, H=11 turns? Let's count the actions.\n\nStart at t=6, y=0.\n\nAction a_6: say U, to y=1 at t=7\n\na_7: U, to y=2 at t=8\n\na_8: U, to y=3 at t=9\n\nNow at t=9, we need to go down or something.\n\na_9: D, to y=2 at t=10\n\nThen a_10: U, to y=3 at t=11\n\na_11: U, to y=4 at t=12\n\na_12: U, to y=5 at t=13\n\na_13: U, to y=6 at t=14\n\na_14: U, to y=7 at t=15\n\na_15: U, to y=8 at t=16\n\na_16: U, to y=9 at t=17\n\nSo at turn t=17, we reach y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=6 to t=16, 11 actions? t=6 to t=16 inclusive is 11 turns, but positions: after a_16 at t=16, we go to y_17=9.\n\nThe sequence a_t for t from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and at turn t_1 + H, we are at y=9.\n\nHere t_1=6, so actions a_6 to a_{6+H-1}, and at turn 6+H, position y=9.\n\nIn above, at turn t=17, y=9, so 6+H=17, H=11.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 are always safe, we can go to them faster.\n\nBut we need to pass through y=1 to 5.\n\nAt t=9, we are on y=3, and t=10 is bad for y=3,4,5.\n\nWe could stay on a safe row like y=2 or something until t=10 passes.\n\ny=2 is safe except t=6, so at t=10 safe.\n\nBut we are at y=3 at t=9.\n\nAnother idea: at t=6, start with S or D, but y=0 is safe, but if we stay or go down, we are still at y=0, which is fine, but doesn't help progress.\n\nFor example, if at t=6 we choose S, then at t=7 still y=0.\n\nThen we can go up, but we lost a turn.\n\nWorse.\n\nGo down, but y cannot be negative, so at y=0, D not possible, I think.\n\ny_t in [0,9], so at y=0, D not possible, only U or S.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, U not possible.\n\nSo at y=0, actions U or S.\n\nIf we choose S at t=6, then at t=7 still y=0.\n\nThen at t=7, U to y=1 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8 U to y=2 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9 U to y=3 at t=10, but y=3 unsafe at t=10, collision.\n\nThen we have to avoid.\n\nBut in this case, we are at y=3 at t=10, worse.\n\nSo better to go up early.\n\nBack to first sequence, we were at y=3 at t=9.\n\nInstead of going down, we could go to a row that is safe at t=10.\n\nBut y=3,4,5 all unsafe at t=10.\n\ny=1,2,6,7,8 safe at t=10.\n\nBut from y=3, we can only go to y=2,3,4.\n\nSo at t=9 on y=3, we can go to y=2,3,4.\n\nAt t=10, y=2 is safe, y=3 and y=4 unsafe.\n\nSo only choice is to go to y=2 at t=10.\n\nThen from there, we can proceed.\n\nBut as before, it takes many turns.\n\nWe can go faster to y=6.\n\nFor example, from start, go up to y=3 by t=9, as before.\n\nThen at t=9, instead of moving, we need to wait, but on y=3, at t=10 unsafe, so we must move away.\n\nTo y=2.\n\nThen at t=10 on y=2, we can go directly to higher rows.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 safe, we can go up multiple times, but we have to go through each row.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=10, we can go U to y=3 at t=11, safe since t=11>10.\n\nThen U to y=4 at t=12, U to y=5 at t=13, U to y=6 at t=14, etc.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt t=10 on y=2, we can go U to y=3 at t=11, then to y=4 at t=12, etc.\n\nBut to reach y=9 from y=2, need 7 up moves, from t=10 to t=17.\n\nStart from t=6.\n\nt=6: y=0, action U, to y=1 at t=7\n\nt=7: U, to y=2 at t=8\n\nt=8: U, to y=3 at t=9\n\nt=9: D, to y=2 at t=10  (avoid t=10 on y=3)\n\nt=10: U, to y=3 at t=11\n\nt=11: U, to y=4 at t=12\n\nt=12: U, to y=5 at t=13\n\nt=13: U, to y=6 at t=14\n\nt=14: U, to y=7 at t=15\n\nt=15: U, to y=8 at t=16\n\nt=16: U, to y=9 at t=17\n\nSo H=11 actions from t=6 to t=16, reach at t=17.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=5 or something before t=10, but y=5 unsafe at t=10, so we need to not be on y=3,4,5 at t=10.\n\nSince y=6 is safe, if we can reach y=6 by t=9 or something.\n\nBut at t=6, y=0, to y=6, need 6 up moves, so at t=7 y=1, t=8 y=2, t=9 y=3, t=10 y=4, t=11 y=5, t=12 y=6.\n\nBut at t=10, on y=4, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if we start later, but we start at t=6.\n\nAnother idea: at t=6, we stay or move, but if we stay at y=0 for one turn.\n\nAt t=6: S, then at t=7 still y=0.\n\nThen at t=7: U to y=1 at t=8\n\nt=8: U to y=2 at t=9\n\nt=9: U to y=3 at t=10, but unsafe.\n\nWorse.\n\nAt t=6: U to y=1 at t=7\n\nt=7: U to y=2 at t=8\n\nThen at t=8, instead of U to y=3, we could stay on y=2 or something.\n\nBut y=2 is safe at t=8.\n\nIf we stay at t=8 on y=2, S, then at t=9 still on y=2.\n\nThen at t=9, U to y=3 at t=10, but y=3 unsafe at t=10.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf at t=8, we go to y=3 at t=9, safe, then at t=9 we need to move to avoid t=10.\n\nTo y=2 or y=4, but y=4 at t=10 unsafe.\n\nSo only to y=2.\n\nSame as before.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=6 directly from lower, but not possible.\n\nNotice that for y=3,4,5, they are safe at t=11, so if we can reach y=3 at t=11 directly.\n\nBut at t=6, y=0, to y=3 at t=11, we need to delay.\n\nFor example, at t=6, S, stay y=0 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, S or U.\n\nIf U at t=7 to y=1 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, U to y=2 at t=9.\n\nThen at t=9, S stay y=2 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, U to y=3 at t=11.\n\nThen at t=11 on y=3, safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 at t=12, U to y=5 at t=13, U to y=6 at t=14, U to y=7 at t=15, U to y=8 at t=16, U to y=9 at t=17.\n\nStill t=17.\n\nFrom t=10 on y=2, we can go U to y=3 at t=11, same.\n\nBut we are at y=2 at t=10, which is better than being at y=0, but still.\n\nIn the first sequence, we were at y=2 at t=10 after going down.\n\nBut here, by staying at y=0, we are at y=2 at t=10 directly.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nt=6: S, to y=0 at t=7? Action at t=6: S, then y_{t+1} = y_t +0, so at turn t+1=7, position y=0.\n\nSimilarly, at t=7, action, say U, then at t=8 y=1.\n\nLet's list:\n\nTurn t=6: action a_6, then at turn t=7 position y_7.\n\nIf a_6 = S, y_7 = y_6 +0 = 0\n\nThen at t=7, if a_7 = S, y_8=0, or a_7=U, y_8=1\n\nIn the sequence I thought: a_6 = S, so at turn t=7, y=0\n\na_7 = U, so at turn t=8, y=1\n\na_8 = U, at turn t=9, y=2\n\na_9 = S, at turn t=10, y=2 (since stay)\n\nThen a_10 = U, at turn t=11, y=3\n\nThen a_11 = U, t=12, y=4\n\na_12 = U, t=13, y=5\n\na_13 = U, t=14, y=6\n\na_14 = U, t=15, y=7\n\na_15 = U, t=16, y=8\n\na_16 = U, t=17, y=9\n\nSame as before, H=11.\n\nIn the first sequence with down move, we had a_9 = D, so at t=10 y=2, then a_10=U to y=3 at t=11, same thing.\n\nSo both ways, we reach at t=17.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we go up faster to y=5 or something, but y=5 unsafe at t=10, so we cannot be on y=5 at t=10.\n\nThe earliest we can be on y=5 is t=11 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=4,3.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=6, to y=5, minimal turns: if all U, at t=7 y=1, t=8 y=2, t=9 y=3, t=10 y=4, t=11 y=5.\n\nBut at t=10, on y=4, unsafe, so we cannot have that.\n\nIf we start with U at t=6 to y=1 at t=7, U to y=2 at t=8, then at t=8, if we go U to y=3 at t=9, then we have to deal with t=10.\n\nIf at t=8, we go directly to y=4? No, we can only move to adjacent rows.\n\nWe can only change by 1 each turn.\n\nSo we must pass through each y from 0 to 9, but y=0 and 9 no cars, so y=1 to 8.\n\nWe need to be on each of y=1 to 8 at some turn, but not necessarily, because we can stay or move, but to go from 0 to 9, we must visit each integer y at least once, in order, since we move one step at a time.\n\nYes, since Δy is ±1 or 0, so y changes by at most 1, so to go from 0 to 9, we must pass through each integer from 0 to 9, in sequence, but not necessarily at consecutive turns if we stay or move down, but since we want minimal turns, we should go up directly, but with waiting.\n\nIn this case, we need to spend time on some rows to avoid bad times.\n\nSpecifically, for y=3,4,5, we cannot be on them at t=10.\n\nSo the bad time is only t=10 for those rows.\n\nWe can be on them at other times.\n\nFor example, we can be on y=3 at t=9 or t=11, etc.\n\nSimilarly for y=4 and y=5.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we should go up as fast as possible except when we hit the bad time.\n\nBut at t=10, we need to be on a safe row, like y=1,2,6,7,8.\n\nSince we are coming from below, at t=9 we might be on y=3 or 4.\n\nIf on y=3 at t=9, we can go to y=2 or y=4, but y=4 at t=10 unsafe, so only to y=2.\n\nThen from y=2 at t=10, we can go to y=3 at t=11, which is safe.\n\nBut y=3 at t=11, then to y=4 at t=12, etc.\n\nThe delay is that from t=9 to t=11, we go from y=3 to y=3, but via y=2, so we waste two turns to gain one row, effectively.\n\nFrom t=9 y=3, to t=11 y=3, but at t=10 we were at y=2.\n\nSo we spent two turns to stay at the same row, but we needed to avoid t=10.\n\nThen from there we go up.\n\nMinimal time: start from t=6 y=0.\n\nGo up each turn until y=3 at t=9.\n\nThen at t=9, go down to y=2 at t=10.\n\nThen at t=10, go up to y=3 at t=11.\n\nThen up to y=4 at t=12, y=5 at t=13, y=6 at t=14, y=7 at t=15, y=8 at t=16, y=9 at t=17.\n\nSame as before.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=10, since y=6 is safe, we can go up multiple times, but we have to go through y=3,4,5 first.\n\nNo, we must go through each step.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps we can reach a higher row earlier by not going to y=3 at t=9.\n\nFor example, at t=8, we are on y=2 (if we went up).\n\nThen at t=8, instead of going to y=3, we could go to y=1 or stay, but that would be worse.\n\nOr, since y=6 is safe, we can go to y=6 directly, but we need to be on y=3,4,5 at some point.\n\nWe can be on y=3 at t=11, for example.\n\nSo let's find a sequence where we are on y=3 at t=11.\n\nFrom start, at t=6 y=0.\n\nWe need to delay.\n\nFor example, at t=6: S, so at t=7 y=0\n\nt=7: S, at t=8 y=0\n\nBut y=0 is safe, but we are not progressing.\n\nThen at t=8: U to y=1 at t=9\n\nt=9: U to y=2 at t=10\n\nt=10: U to y=3 at t=11\n\nThen at t=11 on y=3, safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 at t=12, U to y=5 at t=13, U to y=6 at t=14, U to y=7 at t=15, U to y=8 at t=16, U to y=9 at t=17.\n\nStill t=17, and we spent two turns at y=0, worse than before.\n\nAt t=6: U to y=1 at t=7\n\nt=7: S, stay at y=1 at t=8\n\nThen t=8: U to y=2 at t=9\n\nt=9: U to y=3 at t=10, unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nt=6: U to y=1 at t=7\n\nt=7: U to y=2 at t=8\n\nt=8: S, stay at y=2 at t=9\n\nt=9: U to y=3 at t=10, unsafe.\n\nSame issue.\n\nSo the only way to avoid is to be on a safe row at t=10, and since from below, we can be on y=2 at t=10 by going down from y=3 at t=9 or by staying lower.\n\nBut in all cases, we reach y=9 at t=17 with H=11 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach earlier by going to y=6 faster after t=10.\n\nFor example, once we are on y=3 at t=11, we go U each turn to y=6 at t=14, etc.\n\nBut from y=3 at t=11 to y=6 at t=14, that's three turns for three rows.\n\nMinimal.\n\nPerhaps we can start with multiple up, but the problem is t=10.\n\nAnother thought: at t=10, y=6 is safe, so if we can be on y=6 at t=10.\n\nBut from y=0 at t=6, to y=6 at t=10, that's 4 up moves: t=7 y=1, t=8 y=2, t=9 y=3, t=10 y=4, not y=6.\n\nTo be on y=6 at t=10, we need to be on y=3 at t=7, but at t=6 we are at y=0, so at t=7 y=1, not y=3.\n\nImpossible to be on y=6 at t=10.\n\nEarliest at t=12 as before.\n\nSo I think H=11 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's list the sequence to confirm.\n\nStart at t=6, y=0.\n\na_6 = U  // to y=1 at t=7\n\nAt turn t=7, position y=1, safe since t=7>6\n\na_7 = U  // to y=2 at t=8\n\nt=8, y=2, safe\n\na_8 = U  // to y=3 at t=9\n\nt=9, y=3, safe (t=9<10)\n\na_9 = D  // to y=2 at t=10  (avoid y=3 at t=10)\n\nt=10, y=2, safe (y=2 safe at t=10)\n\na_10 = U  // to y=3 at t=11\n\nt=11, y=3, safe (t=11>10)\n\na_11 = U  // to y=4 at t=12\n\nt=12, y=4, safe (y=4 safe at t=12)\n\na_12 = U  // to y=5 at t=13\n\nt=13, y=5, safe\n\na_13 = U  // to y=6 at t=14\n\nt=14, y=6, safe\n\na_14 = U  // to y=7 at t=15\n\nt=15, y=7, safe\n\na_15 = U  // to y=8 at t=16\n\nt=16, y=8, safe\n\na_16 = U  // to y=9 at t=17\n\nAt turn t=17, we reach y=9.\n\nActions from a_6 to a_16, that's 11 actions: t=6 to t=16.\n\nH=11.\n\nSequence: a_6=U, a_7=U, a_8=U, a_9=D, a_10=U, a_11=U, a_12=U, a_13=U, a_14=U, a_15=U, a_16=U.\n\nNow, is there a sequence with H=10?\n\nSuppose we reach at t=16.\n\nThen actions from t=6 to t=15, 10 actions, to be at y=9 at t=16.\n\nSo from t=6 to t=16, 11 turns? Let's see.\n\nStart at turn t=6, position y=0.\n\nAfter action a_6, at turn t=7, position y_7.\n\nAfter a_7, at t=8 y_8, ..., after a_{t_1 + H-1}, at turn t_1 + H, position.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn t_1 + H = 6 + H.\n\nWith H actions, we reach at turn 6+H.\n\nIf H=10, reach at turn 16.\n\ny must be 9 at turn 16.\n\nFrom y=0 at turn 6 to y=9 at turn 16, that's 10 turns later, so we must have net +9 in y, with possible stays or down, but since min turns, should be mostly up.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions.\n\nSuppose at some point we go up faster, but we are constrained by the bad time.\n\nFor example, if we are on y=3 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=6 y=0, to y=3 at t=8: need two up moves.\n\nt=6: U to y=1 at t=7\n\nt=7: U to y=2 at t=8\n\nThen at t=8, U to y=3 at t=9.\n\nCannot be at y=3 at t=8.\n\nEarliest at t=9 as before.\n\nThen at t=9 y=3, we need to be at y=9 by t=16.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=9 to y=9 at t=16, that's 7 turns for 6 steps, so we can have one stay or down, but we have to deal with t=10.\n\nIf at t=9 we go U to y=4 at t=10, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf we go to y=4 at t=11, for example.\n\nAt t=9 y=3, we go to y=2 at t=10, then to y=3 at t=11, then to y=4 at t=12, etc., as before, to y=9 at t=17.\n\nIf we can skip some rows, but no.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's check row y=8, it has cars but always safe, no issue.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo the sequence should be as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, at a_9 we have D, which is down, but y=3 to y=2, which is fine.\n\nThen at a_10 U again.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nWe need to output the actions starting from turn t_1=6.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nAfter a_16, at turn 17, y=9.\n\nH=11 actions.\n\nBut let's write the turns from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nt_1=6, H=11, so actions from turn 6 to turn 16.\n\nIn the sequence above.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence without down move, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother idea: since y=1 and y=2 are safe after t=6, we can stay there if needed, but not necessary.\n\nSuppose at t=8 on y=2, we stay: a_8 = S, then at t=9 y=2.\n\nThen a_9 = U to y=3 at t=10, unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\na_8 = U to y=3 at t=9, then a_9 = S, but at t=10 y=3 unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think the down move is necessary to avoid.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=11.\n\nNow, for the car on row y=8, it has two cars but both always safe, no issue.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nWe need to box the answer.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 6: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: & U \\end{array} }\n\nBut let's write the actions clearly.\n\nIn the sequence, after Turn 16: U, the next turn is 17, position y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nTo make sure, let's simulate the positions:\n\nTurn 6: start y=0, action U\n\nTurn 7: y=1, action U\n\nTurn 8: y=2, action U\n\nTurn 9: y=3, action D\n\nTurn 10: y=2, action U\n\nTurn 11: y=3, action U\n\nTurn 12: y=4, action U\n\nTurn 13: y=5, action U\n\nTurn 14: y=6, action U\n\nTurn 15: y=7, action U\n\nTurn 16: y=8, action U\n\nTurn 17: y=9.\n\nNow check collisions:\n\nTurn 7: y=1, t=7, safe as per earlier.\n\nTurn 8: y=2, t=8, safe.\n\nTurn 9: y=3, t=9, safe.\n\nTurn 10: y=2, t=10, safe.\n\nTurn 11: y=3, t=11, safe.\n\nTurn 12: y=4, t=12, for y=4, at t=12, t-6=6, first car min x= -59 +12(6)= -59+72=13, max x= -48+72=24, [13,24], 0 not in. Second car [25+72,36+72]=[97,108], no. Third car [-11+72,72]=[61,72], no. Safe.\n\nSimilarly y=5 same.\n\ny=6,7,8 always safe.\n\nSo no collisions.\n\nAnd we reached at turn 17 with 11 actions.\n\nIf we try H=10, actions from t=6 to t=15, reach at t=16.\n\nBut from y=0 at t=6 to y=9 at t=16, must have 9 up moves and possibly one stay or down, but down would require extra up, so must be all up except one stay or something.\n\nBut with the constraint, at t=10 we must be on safe row not y=3,4,5.\n\nSuppose we are on y=5 at t=11, for example.\n\nBut to be on y=5 at t=11, from y=0 at t=6.\n\nt=7 y=1, t=8 y=2, t=9 y=3, t=10 y=4, t=11 y=5.\n\nBut at t=10, y=4, unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we are on y=6 at t=11: t=7 y=1, t=8 y=2, t=9 y=3, t=10 y=4, t=11 y=5, not y=6.\n\nTo be on y=6 at t=11: t=7 y=1, t=8 y=2, t=9 y=3, t=10 y=4, t=11 y=5, cannot.\n\nEarliest y=6 at t=12: t=7 y=1, t=8 y=2, t=9 y=3, t=10 y=4 (unsafe), t=11 y=5, t=12 y=6.\n\nBut t=10 unsafe.\n\nSo impossible to avoid without the detour or delay.\n\nThus H=11 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) is 11, with the sequence of actions starting from turn 6 to turn 16. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on rows \\(y = 3, 4, 5\\) at turn 10 (when these rows are unsafe due to car coverage at \\(x = 0\\)) and navigates through safe positions at all times.\n\n### Sequence of Actions:\n- At turn 6, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 7. Since \\(y = 1\\) is safe at turn 7 (unsafe only at turn 6), no collision occurs.\n- At turn 7, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 8. \\(y = 2\\) is safe at turn 8 (unsafe only at turn 6).\n- At turn 8, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 9. \\(y = 3\\) is safe at turn 9 (unsafe at turns 6 and 10).\n- At turn 9, action \\(D\\) moves to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 10 to avoid being on \\(y = 3, 4,\\) or \\(5\\) at turn 10. \\(y = 2\\) is safe at turn 10.\n- At turn 10, action \\(U\\) moves back to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 11. \\(y = 3\\) is safe at turn 11.\n- At turn 11, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 12. \\(y = 4\\) is safe at turn 12 (unsafe only at turns 6 and 10).\n- At turn 12, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 13. \\(y = 5\\) is safe at turn 13 (unsafe only at turns 6 and 10).\n- At turn 13, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 14. Rows \\(y = 6, 7, 8\\) are always safe, so no collision risk.\n- At turn 14, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 15 (safe).\n- At turn 15, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 16 (safe).\n- At turn 16, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17, reaching the goal.\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17 (i.e., \\(t_1 + H = 6 + 11 = 17\\)) with \\(H = 11\\) actions, and it is minimal because any shorter sequence would require being on an unsafe row at turn 10 or missing the net upward movement needed.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Turn 7 (\\(y=1\\))**: Safe (car on \\(y=1\\) covers \\(x=0\\) only at turn 6).\n- **Turn 8 (\\(y=2\\))**: Safe (car on \\(y=2\\) covers \\(x=0\\) only at turn 6).\n- **Turn 9 (\\(y=3\\))**: Safe (cars on \\(y=3\\) cover \\(x=0\\) at turns 6 and 10, not at turn 9).\n- **Turn 10 (\\(y=2\\))**: Safe (car on \\(y=2\\) does not cover \\(x=0\\) at turn 10).\n- **Turn 11 (\\(y=3\\))**: Safe (turn 11 > 10, cars do not cover \\(x=0\\)).\n- **Turn 12 (\\(y=4\\))**: Safe (cars on \\(y=4\\) cover \\(x=0\\) at turns 6 and 10, not at turn 12).\n- **Turn 13 (\\(y=5\\))**: Safe (similar to \\(y=4\\)).\n- **Turns 14-16 (\\(y=6,7,8\\))**: Always safe (no cars cover \\(x=0\\) at any time for these rows).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 6: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: & U \\end{array} }",

Actions are U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), or S (stay, y same), and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right with given speeds, and I collide only if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T and there's a car on that freeway where 0 is in its span at that turn. Importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move up at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y_T, and at T+1 I'm on y_{T+1}.\n\nThe car states are given for turn t_1=10. I need to find a sequence of actions from turn 10 onwards to reach y=9 safely.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each future turn relative to x=0, since collision depends on whether 0 is in the car's span at the time I'm on that row.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=10 for simplicity, so at t=10, I'm at (0,0).\n\nI need to go to y=9. Since y=0 and y=9 are safe (no cars), but I have to go through y=1 to 8, which have cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways; freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, but I need to be on y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so I need to be at position (0,9) at turn T for some T, and at that turn, since it's not a freeway (I think y=9 is not a freeway, similarly y=0), so no cars there, so it's always safe. But when I'm moving through y=1 to 8, I need to avoid cars.\n\ny=9 is the top, probably no freeway there, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is bottom, safe.\n\nNow, the cars: for each freeway k=1 to 8, there are cars with initial positions at t=10.\n\nSince the cars move linearly with constant speed, I can compute for each car, the times when 0 is in its span.\n\nBecause collision occurs at turn T if I'm on freeway y_T and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at T.\n\nSo for each freeway, I need to find the set of turns when it is unsafe to be on that row, meaning that at that turn, there is a car covering x=0.\n\nThen, for my path, when I am on a particular y at turn t, it must be that y is not unsafe at that turn.\n\nSince I move one step at a time, I need to choose actions so that for each t, when I'm at y_t, it is safe at that t.\n\ny_t is determined by the actions.\n\nI start at y=0 at t=10.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince I can only change y by -1,0,1 each turn, the minimal number of turns to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 turns, if I go up every time: U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U, that would be 9 actions, reaching y=9 at t=19.\n\nBut I might have to wait or go down sometimes to avoid cars, so H might be more than 9.\n\nH is the number of turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so if I start at t_1, after H turns I am at turn t_1 + H, position after H actions.\n\nLet's clarify the indexing.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t, and I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, I am at y_t, I choose a_t, then at the beginning of turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nIn the player update, it says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nAnd collision at turn T if y_T is a freeway (1-8) and 0 in some car's span on that freeway at T.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and if I move to y_{T+1}, I am not on y_{T+1} until T+1.\n\nIn the collision note, it says if I move to y_{T+1} at turn T, I am not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so if at turn T, 0 is in span for a car on y_{T+1}, but I'm not on y_{T+1} yet, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, I am on y_T at turn T.\n\nSo for each turn, I only care about the safety of y_T at that turn, not the future or past positions.\n\nNow, for the path, I need a sequence of actions from a_{10} to a_{10+H-1} such that after H actions, at turn t=10+H, I am at y=9.\n\nLet t be the turn index.\n\nStart: t=10, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_t at turn t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo at turn t, I choose a_t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nBut y_t is fixed at the start of turn t.\n\nTo reach y=9 at some turn T.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at t=10, and I want to be at y=9 at turn T, for some T.\n\nThe minimal T is t=19 if I go up every turn: actions at t=10 to t=18: all U, then at t=19, y=9.\n\nBut I might reach earlier if I go up faster, but I can only go up by 1 per turn, so min turns from y=0 to y=9 is 9 actions, from t=10 to t=18, reaching y=9 at t=19.\n\ny_{10} = 0\n\na_{10} = U → y_{11} = 1\n\na_{11} = U → y_{12} = 2\n\n...\n\na_{18} = U → y_{19} = 9\n\nSo at turn t=19, y=9.\n\nWith 9 actions: t=10 to t=18.\n\nH actions from t=10 to t=10+H-1, so after H actions, at turn t=10+H, y= y_{10} + sum of Δy.\n\nSince y_{10} =0, and each action changes y by at most 1, to reach y=9, I need at least 9 up actions, and H must be at least 9.\n\nIf I have down actions, H increases, so minimal H is 9, if I can go straight up without collision.\n\nBut I might need to wait or detour, so H >=9.\n\nNow, I need to check if going straight up is possible without collision.\n\nThat is, for each t from 10 to 18, when I am at y = t-10, at that turn, is it safe?\n\nAt turn t, y_t = t - 10 for t=10 to 18.\n\ny_10 = 0, but y=0 is not a freeway, so safe.\n\ny_11 =1, freeway 1, need to check if unsafe at t=11.\n\nSimilarly, y_12=2 at t=12, and so on, up to y_18=8 at t=18, then at t=19 y=9 safe.\n\ny_19=9 not freeway.\n\nNow, for each freeway k, I need to find for which turns t, it is unsafe to be on k, i.e., at turn t, there is a car on k with 0 in its span.\n\nThen for my path, when I am on row k at turn t, it must be safe, i.e., not unsafe at that t.\n\nFirst, let's list the car states at t=10.\n\nFor each freeway, cars are given.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h, τ, d, s) = (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so it's moving left, span at t=10 is [h, τ] but since moving left, head is left, tail right? No.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn this case, for left-moving, at t1, span is [h, τ], and since moving left, h and τ decrease.\n\nBut in the span, for left-moving, [h, τ] with h < τ? Or not specified.\n\nIn the example, freeway 1: (48,83,left,36)\n\n48 and 83, since left-moving, and h=48, τ=83, so if moving left, the head should be the left end, but here h=48, τ=83, 48<83, so if moving left, at t=10, left end is h=48, right end τ=83.\n\nThen at time T, span is [48 - 36(T-10), 83 - 36(T-10)]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] with τ < h, I think.\n\nIn freeway 3, (48,37,right,12), and it says [τ, h] for right-moving.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nRight-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn left-moving, [h, τ] and h and τ such that for movement, the values decrease.\n\nIn freeway 1, (48,83,left,36), so at t=10, span [48,83]\n\nSince moving left, at time T, span [48 - 36(T-10), 83 - 36(T-10)]\n\n0 is in span if 48 - 36(T-10) <= 0 <= 83 - 36(T-10)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, freeway 1 has only one car: (48,83,left,36)\n\nSo unsafe when 48 - 36(T-10) <= 0 <= 83 - 36(T-10)\n\nSolve for T.\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36(T-10) <= 0 => 48 <= 36(T-10) => T-10 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so T-10 >= 2 since T integer? T is turn, integer.\n\nT-10 >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) = 2\n\n48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so 48 - 36(T-10) <=0 when 36(T-10) >=48, so T-10 >= 48/36 = 4/3, since T-10 integer, T-10 >= 2.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 83 - 36(T-10) => 36(T-10) <=83 => T-10 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so T-10 <= 2 since integer.\n\n83/36 = 2.305..., so T-10 <= floor(2.305) = 2? No.\n\n0 <= 83 - 36(T-10) implies 36(T-10) <=83, so T-10 <= 83/36 ≈2.305, since T-10 integer, T-10 <= 2.\n\nAnd from first inequality, T-10 >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(1.333) = 2.\n\nSo T-10 >=2 and T-10 <=2, so T-10=2, i.e., T=12.\n\nSo at turn T=12, 0 is in span for freeway 1.\n\nFor other T, not unsafe.\n\nCheck:\n\nAt T=12, T-10=2, span [48-36*2, 83-36*2] = [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11], so 0 is between -24 and 11, yes, 0 in [-24,11].\n\nAt T=11, T-10=1, [48-36, 83-36] = [12,47], 0 not in [12,47].\n\nT=13, T-10=3, [48-108, 83-108] = [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 1 unsafe only at t=12.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (48,83,left,36), identical, so also unsafe only at t=12.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1=10 is given as [τ, h] for each.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) — τ=37, h=48? In the list it says (head, tail, direction, speed), but in the span definition for right-moving, it uses τ and h with [τ,h].\n\nIn the car state: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nThen for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left.\n\nSo for freeway 3, first car: h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12.\n\nSo at t=10, span [τ, h] = [37,48]\n\nThen at T, [37 + 12(T-10), 48 + 12(T-10)]\n\nUnsafe if 0 in [37 + 12(T-10), 48 + 12(T-10)]\n\n37 + 12(T-10) <= 0 <= 48 + 12(T-10)\n\nFirst: 37 + 12(T-10) <=0 => 12(T-10) <= -37 => T-10 <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, impossible since T>=10, T-10>=0, so 37 +12(T-10) >=37 >0, so left end >0, 0 not <= left end? Inequality.\n\n0 in [L,R] means L <= 0 <= R.\n\nHere L = 37 +12(T-10) >=37 >0 for T>=10, so L >0, thus 0 < L <= R, so 0 not in [L,R] since 0 < L.\n\nSimilarly, R>0, but L>0, so 0 not in interval. So this car never covers x=0, since min L=37 at T=10.\n\nSimilarly, at any T, L >=37, so 0 not covered.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12), h=12, τ=1, so span at t=10 [τ,h] = [1,12]\n\nAt T, [1 + 12(T-10), 12 + 12(T-10)]\n\nUnsafe if 1 + 12(T-10) <= 0 <= 12 + 12(T-10)\n\nFirst: 1 +12(T-10) <=0 => 12(T-10) <= -1 => T-10 <= -1/12 <0, impossible.\n\nL =1 +12(T-10) >=1 >0 for T>=10, so L>0, 0 not in [L,R].\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12), h=-24? τ=-35.\n\nHead and tail: h=-24, τ=-35, but since right-moving, span [τ,h] = [-35,-24] at t=10.\n\nAt T, [ -35 + 12(T-10), -24 + 12(T-10) ]\n\nUnsafe if -35 +12(T-10) <= 0 <= -24 +12(T-10)\n\nFirst inequality: -35 +12(T-10) <=0 => 12(T-10) <=35 => T-10 <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so T-10 <= 2\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -24 +12(T-10) => 24 <= 12(T-10) => T-10 >= 24/12 = 2\n\nSo T-10 >=2 and T-10 <=2, so T-10=2, T=12.\n\nAt T=12, span [ -35 +12(2), -24 +12(2) ] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0], so 0 is in [-11,0], yes.\n\nOther T not.\n\nSo for freeway 3, only the third car can cover x=0, at t=12.\n\nFirst two cars never cover x=0.\n\nSo unsafe only at t=12.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same cars as freeway 3? \" (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) \" identical to freeway 3, so also unsafe only at t=12.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same, unsafe only at t=12.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car: (48,37,right,6)\n\nh=48, τ=37, d=right, s=6.\n\nSpan at t=10 [τ,h] = [37,48]\n\nAt T, [37 +6(T-10), 48 +6(T-10)]\n\nL=37+6(T-10) >=37>0, so 0 not in, always safe? L>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: (48,37,right,6), same as above, always safe.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (48,37,right,6), and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: same as above, never covers x=0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6), h=0, τ=-11? Head and tail.\n\nh=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=6.\n\nSpan at t=10 [τ,h] = [-11,0] for right-moving.\n\nAt T, [ -11 +6(T-10), 0 +6(T-10) ] = [ -11 +6(T-10), 6(T-10) ]\n\nUnsafe if -11 +6(T-10) <= 0 <= 6(T-10)\n\nFirst inequality: -11 +6(T-10) <=0 => 6(T-10) <=11 => T-10 <= 11/6 ≈1.833, so T-10 <=1\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 6(T-10) => T-10 >=0\n\nSince T>=10, T-10>=0.\n\nSo for T-10=0: T=10, span [-11,0], 0 in [-11,0]? L=-11 <=0, R=0, so 0 <=0 is true, so 0 in [L,R].\n\nAt T=10, L=-11, R=0, so 0 <= R and L<=0, yes.\n\nAt T=11, T-10=1, span [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6], 0 in [-5,6] yes.\n\nT=12, span [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], L=1>0, 0 not in.\n\nT=9? T=10 is current, T>=10.\n\nT-10=0: T=10, unsafe\n\nT-10=1: T=11, unsafe\n\nT-10=2: T=12, not unsafe, as above.\n\nNow, the inequality: T-10 >=0 and T-10 <=1, so T=10 and T=11.\n\nT-10 <= floor(11/6)? From above: T-10 <=1 and T-10 >=0, so T=10,11.\n\nAt T=10: span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt T=11: span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt T=12: [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 8 unsafe at t=10 and t=11.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, unsafe turns:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at t=12\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at t=12\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe at t=12\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe at t=12\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at t=12\n\nFreeway 6: always safe (no car covers x=0)\n\nFreeway 7: always safe\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at t=10 and t=11\n\nNow, back to the straight up path: I start at t=10, y=0, safe.\n\nThen action a_t at turn t.\n\nFor t=10: I am at y=0, choose a_10, which sets y_{11}.\n\nIf I go up, a_10=U, then y_{11}=1.\n\nBut at turn t=10, I am on y=0, which is safe.\n\nNow, at turn t=11, I would be on y=1 if I went up.\n\nBut freeway 1 is y=1.\n\nAt t=11, is y=1 unsafe? From above, freeway 1 unsafe only at t=12, not at t=11.\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe only t=12.\n\nAt t=11, freeway 1 is safe, as we saw earlier, span [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nIn the straight up path:\n\nt=10: y=0, safe (not freeway)\n\na_10=U → y_{11}=1\n\nt=11: now I am on y=1 (freeway 1), at turn t=11.\n\nIs it safe? Freeway 1 at t=11: not unsafe, as above.\n\nThen a_11=U → y_{12}=2\n\nt=12: on y=2 (freeway 2), at t=12.\n\nBut freeway 2 is unsafe at t=12! Freeway 2 has same as freeway 1, unsafe at t=12.\n\nSo at t=12, if I am on y=2, it is unsafe, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nIn straight up: at t=12, y=2, which is freeway 2, and unsafe at t=12.\n\nSimilarly, if I were on any freeway 1-5 at t=12, it would be unsafe, but in this case, at t=12, y=2.\n\nFreeways 1 to 5 all unsafe at t=12.\n\nFreeway 6 and 7 always safe.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at t=10,11.\n\nIn straight up path:\n\nt=10: y=0, safe\n\nt=11: y=1 (freeway 1), safe since not unsafe at t=11\n\nt=12: y=2 (freeway 2), unsafe at t=12, collision.\n\nSo cannot go straight up without stopping or something.\n\nI need to avoid being on freeways 1-5 at t=12.\n\nSince freeways 1-5 are all unsafe at t=12, I must not be on any of them at turn t=12.\n\nThat is, at turn t=12, I should not be on y=1,2,3,4,5.\n\ny=6,7 are safe, y=8 is freeway 8, but at t=12, freeway 8 is safe, since unsafe only at t=10,11.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at t=10 and 11, but at t=12, safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nNow, I start at t=10, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nOne idea: at t=12, I should be on a safe row, like y=0,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=9 I might not reach yet.\n\nSince at t=12, rows 1-5 are unsafe, I can be on row 0,6,7,8.\n\nRow 0 is bottom.\n\nNow, from t=10 to t=12.\n\nt=10: I am at y=0.\n\nI choose a_10.\n\nIf I do S (stay), then y_{11} = y_{10} =0, so at t=11, I am still at y=0.\n\nThen at t=11, I can choose action.\n\nIf I go U at t=10, y_{11}=1.\n\nThen at t=11, on y=1.\n\ny=1 at t=11 is safe, as freeway 1 not unsafe at t=11.\n\nBut then at t=11, I need to choose a_11.\n\nIf I go U, y_{12}=2, but at t=12 on y=2, unsafe.\n\nIf I go D, y_{12}=0, then at t=12 on y=0, safe.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nIf I go S at t=11, y_{12}=1, then at t=12 on y=1, unsafe.\n\nSo if I go to y=1 at t=11, the only safe choice at t=11 is to go down to y=0 for t=12.\n\nBut that wastes time.\n\nI could go directly to a higher row by waiting or something.\n\nAnother idea: since freeways 6 and 7 are always safe, I can be there anytime.\n\nFreeway 8 safe except t=10,11.\n\nt=10 and t=11 unsafe for y=8.\n\nNow, I need to minimize H, so I want to go up as fast as possible with detours.\n\nMinimal H is 9, but with collision at t=12, so I need to spend extra turns to avoid.\n\nH=9 might not be possible, so I need H>9.\n\nNow, let's think about the critical time t=12.\n\nI must not be on y=1,2,3,4,5 at t=12.\n\nSo at turn t=12, y_{12} must be in {0,6,7,8,9}.\n\nBut at t=10, I am at y=0.\n\nAfter two actions (t=10 and t=11), I can reach y from 0 to 2, or down to 0, etc.\n\ny_{12} depends on actions at t=10 and t=11.\n\nAt t=10, y_10=0.\n\nAfter a_10, y_{11} = y_10 + Δy_10, which is 0,1,-1? But y=0, if I go D, y=-1, but y must be >=0, so D at y=0: y_{11} = max(0, y_t -1) = max(0,-1)=0, similarly, cannot go below 0.\n\nSimilarly, above 9.\n\nSo actions: at y=0, D does nothing, similarly at y=9, U does nothing.\n\nSo at y=0, possible actions: S or U (D same as S).\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, S or D (U same).\n\nBut here y=0, so a_t: S or U.\n\nIf S, y_{t+1}=0\n\nIf U, y_{t+1}=1\n\nSimilarly for other y.\n\nNow, at t=10, y=0.\n\nChoose a_10:\n\n- If S, then y_{11}=0\n\n- If U, then y_{11}=1\n\nNow, at t=11, depending on y_{11}, choose a_11.\n\nThen y_{12} = y_{11} + Δy_{11}\n\nWe need y_{12} not in {1,2,3,4,5}, so y_{12} in {0,6,7,8,9}\n\nBut from y=0 or y=1 at t=11, I can only reach y=0,1,2 at t=12.\n\nIf at t=11 y=0, then a_11: S → y_{12}=0, U → y_{12}=1\n\nIf at t=11 y=1, then a_11: D → y_{12}=0, S → y_{12}=1, U → y_{12}=2\n\nSo possible y_{12} values:\n\n- If a_10=S, y_{11}=0, then y_{12} = 0 or 1\n\n- If a_10=U, y_{11}=1, then y_{12} = 0,1, or 2\n\nAll possible y_{12} are 0,1,2, all of which are in {1,2,3,4,5} except 0.\n\ny=0 is safe, but y=1 and 2 are unsafe at t=12.\n\ny=0 is not in {1,2,3,4,5}, it is safe.\n\nBut y=1 and 2 are unsafe.\n\nSo to have y_{12} not unsafe, we need y_{12} = 0, since 1 and 2 are unsafe.\n\ny_{12} must be in {0,6,7,8,9}, but from above, only 0,1,2 possible, and only 0 is safe and possible.\n\nSo y_{12} must be 0 to avoid collision at t=12.\n\nIs that right?\n\ny_{12} =0 is possible, and it is safe.\n\ny_{12}=1 or 2 would be unsafe.\n\nBut y=6,7,8,9 not reachable from here in two steps.\n\nSo the only way to be safe at t=12 is to be at y=0 at turn t=12.\n\nThat means, I need to stay at y=0 or go down to it.\n\nSpecifically: from t=10, if I do nothing, stay at y=0 for t=11 and t=12.\n\nOr, if I go up at t=10, to y=1 at t=11, then I must go down at t=11 to y=0 for t=12.\n\nIn both cases, at t=12, I am at y=0.\n\nNow, after that, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut at t=12, I am at y=0, which is safe.\n\nNow, I can start going up.\n\nBut freeways 1-5 are unsafe only at t=12, not at other times.\n\nFor example, freeway 1 unsafe only t=12, so at other times safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at t=10,11, but t=12 safe.\n\nNow, from t=12, y=0, I can go up.\n\nBut I need to go through the rows.\n\nThe critical point is passed.\n\nNow, minimal time: I spent two turns at y=0 (t=10 and t=11? Not necessarily.\n\nIn the above, to have y_{12}=0, I can have different paths.\n\nCase 1: at t=10, S (stay), then y_{11}=0\n\nThen at t=11, S (stay), y_{12}=0\n\nOr at t=11, U, but if U at t=11, y_{12}=1, which is unsafe, so I cannot do that; must S at t=11 to have y_{12}=0.\n\nIf at t=10, U, then y_{11}=1\n\nThen at t=11, I must do D to go to y_{12}=0, since if S or U, y_{12}=1 or 2, unsafe.\n\nSo only two possibilities:\n\n- a_10=S, a_11=S: then y_{11}=0 (at t=11), y_{12}=0\n\n- or a_10=U, a_11=D: then at t=11, y=1, then y_{12}=0\n\nIn both cases, at t=12, y=0.\n\nIn the first case, at t=11, I am at y=0, which is safe.\n\nIn second case, at t=11, I am at y=1, which is freeway 1, but at t=11, it is safe, as we said.\n\nThen I go down to y=0 at t=12.\n\nNow, after t=12, I can go up freely, since no more unsafe times, except I need to check freeway 8, but unsafe only at t=10,11, which are past.\n\nt=12 and later, freeway 8 safe.\n\nFreeways 6 and 7 always safe.\n\nNow, from t=12, y=0, I need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal actions: 9 up actions, but I need to specify the turns.\n\nAt t=12, y=0\n\nThen to reach y=9, I need to increase y by 9, so at least 9 actions: U each turn from t=12 to t=20, reaching y=9 at t=21.\n\nt=12: y=0\n\na_12=U → y_{13}=1\n\na_13=U → y_{14}=2\n\n...\n\na_20=U → y_{21}=9\n\nWith 9 actions: t=12 to t=20.\n\nAt each step, I need to check safety, but since no cars at critical times, should be fine.\n\nFor example, at t=13, y=1, freeway 1: is it safe? Freeway 1 unsafe only at t=12, not at t=13.\n\nAt t=13, T=13, t1=10, T-t1=3, span [48-36*3, 83-36*3] = [48-108, 83-108] = [-60,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=14, y=2, freeway 2: similarly, T=14, T-t1=4, [48-144,83-144]=[-96,-61], safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=15, y=3, freeway 3: at t=15, cars: for example, the third car: at T=15, T-t1=5, for the car that was unsafe at t=12, but now: (-24,-35,right,12), at T=15, [ -35 +12(5), -24 +12(5) ] = [-35+60, -24+60] = [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nOther cars never cover, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4,5 same.\n\ny=6,7 always safe.\n\ny=8 at t=20? Let's see the sequence.\n\ny_t: t=12:0\n\nt=13:1 after a_12=U\n\nt=14:2 after a_13=U\n\nt=15:3 after a_14=U\n\nt=16:4 after a_15=U\n\nt=17:5 after a_16=U\n\nt=18:6 after a_17=U\n\nt=19:7 after a_18=U\n\nt=20:8 after a_19=U? Actions from t=12 to t=20.\n\ny_{12}=0\n\na_12=U → y_{13}=1\n\na_13=U → y_{14}=2\n\na_14=U → y_{15}=3\n\na_15=U → y_{16}=4\n\na_16=U → y_{17}=5\n\na_17=U → y_{18}=6\n\na_18=U → y_{19}=7\n\na_19=U → y_{20}=8\n\nNow at t=20, y=8, which is freeway 8.\n\nIs it safe? Freeway 8 at t=20.\n\nCars: first car (48,37,right,6), at T=20, t1=10, T-t1=10, span [37 +6*10, 48+6*10] = [37+60,48+60]=[97,108], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car (0,-11,right,6), at T=20, [ -11 +6*10, 0 +6*10] = [-11+60, 60] = [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen a_20=U → y_{21}=9, at t=21, y=9, safe.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9, so at t=21, I am at y=9.\n\nNow, what about the actions before t=12.\n\nWe have two options for the first part.\n\nFirst option: a_10=S, a_11=S\n\nThen at t=11, y=0, safe.\n\na_10=S: at turn t=10, action S, so y_{11}=0\n\nThen a_11=S: at t=11, action S, y_{12}=0\n\nThen from t=12 to t=20, all U, as above.\n\nActions: t=10: S, t=11: S, t=12: U, t=13: U, ..., t=20: U\n\nThat's 11 actions: from t=10 to t=20, H=11.\n\nt=10 to t=20 inclusive is 11 turns? Let's see the indices.\n\nActions from t=10 to t=20, that's 11 actions: a_10 to a_20.\n\nAfter a_20, at turn t=21, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=10 to t=10 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=10 + H.\n\nSet t=10 as start.\n\nAfter 0 actions: at t=10, y=0\n\nAfter 1 action: at t=11, y=?\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions: at t=10 + H, y=9\n\nWe need min H such that we can reach y=9 at t=10+H.\n\nWith the above: with H=11 actions: a_10 to a_20, then at t=21, y=9.\n\nt=10+H =21, so H=11.\n\nSecond option: a_10=U, then at t=11, y=1, which is safe at t=11.\n\nThen a_11=D, so y_{12}=0\n\nThen same as before, a_12 to a_20 all U, reaching y=9 at t=21.\n\nNow, with this, actions: a_10=U, a_11=D, then a_12 to a_20 all U.\n\nStill 11 actions to reach at t=21.\n\nBut in this case, at t=11, I went to y=1 and back, which might be unnecessary, but same number of actions.\n\nIn the first option, I stayed at y=0 for two turns.\n\nBut in terms of H, both take 11 actions.\n\nCan I reach faster?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=6 or something at t=12, but I cannot, since from y=0, in two steps, max y=2.\n\nBut y=2 is unsafe at t=12.\n\nSo I must be at y=0 at t=12.\n\nThen from there, min 9 up actions to reach y=9, so min H=11.\n\nBut H includes the actions to reach y=9.\n\nFrom t=10, with actions starting at t=10.\n\nAfter 0 actions: t=10, y=0\n\nAfter 1 action: t=11, y=0 or 1\n\nAfter 2 actions: t=12, y=0 (as we must)\n\nThen after 2 actions, at t=12, y=0.\n\nNow from there, I need to go to y=9, which takes at least 9 more actions, so after 11 actions, at t=21, y=9.\n\nSo H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can save time elsewhere.\n\nFor example, at later times, can I go faster? But no, because I need exactly 9 up moves to increase y by 9.\n\nUnless I can start from higher, but at t=12 I am at y=0.\n\nIn the sequence, when I go up from t=12, I go through each row at different times, all safe.\n\nFor example, at t=13, y=1, safe.\n\nt=14, y=2, safe, and so on.\n\nNow, about freeway 8: at t=10 and t=11 unsafe, but in the up path, I am on y=8 at t=20, which is fine.\n\nIn the sequence above, when I go to y=8 at t=20, it is safe.\n\nBut at earlier times, I don't go to y=8.\n\nAnother thing: in the first two actions, I have two choices.\n\nBut both lead to same H=11.\n\nNow, I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be for turn t_1=10.\n\nNow, let's write the actions.\n\nFirst, with the stay option: actions from t=10 to t=20.\n\nt=10: S\n\nt=11: S\n\nt=12: U\n\nt=13: U\n\nt=14: U\n\nt=15: U\n\nt=16: U\n\nt=17: U\n\nt=18: U\n\nt=19: U\n\nt=20: U\n\nThen at t=21, y=9.\n\nAfter a_20, at turn t=21, position (0,9).\n\nWith the up-down option: a_10=U, a_11=D, then a_12 to a_20 all U.\n\nSame number.\n\nBut in this case, at t=11, I was on y=1, which is safe, then I go down.\n\nBut it might be less efficient if there were other constraints, but here same H.\n\nI think both are fine, but perhaps the stay is simpler.\n\nIn the stay option, at t=11, I am at y=0, which is safe.\n\nIn up-down, at t=11, I am at y=1, which is also safe at that time.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut to minimize actions, same.\n\nNow, but I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, for the up part, I have to go through all rows.\n\nBut is there a way to skip some or go faster? No, since I can only change by 1 each turn.\n\nUnless I can go directly to a row that is safe, but I have to go sequentially.\n\nAnother thought: since freeways 6 and 7 are always safe, I could go there directly, but from y=0, I have to go through y=1,2,etc. to reach y=6.\n\nNo way to jump.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn when I reach y=9.\n\nStart: t=10, y=0\n\nAfter a_10: if S, t=11, y=0\n\nAfter a_11: if S, t=12, y=0\n\nThen a_12=U, t=13, y=1\n\na_13=U, t=14, y=2\n\n...\n\na_19=U, t=20, y=8? Let's count.\n\nAfter a_12 at t=12, y=1 at t=13\n\nAfter a_13 at t=13, y=2 at t=14\n\n...\n\nAfter a_19 at t=19, y=8 at t=20? Actions:\n\nAfter action at t, y_{t+1}.\n\nSo:\n\nAt t=10, before action, y=0\n\na_10: say S, then after action, at t=11, y=0\n\nSimilarly, a_11: S, at t=12, y=0\n\na_12: U, at t=13, y=1\n\na_13: U, at t=14, y=2\n\na_14: U, at t=15, y=3\n\na_15: U, at t=16, y=4\n\na_16: U, at t=17, y=5\n\na_17: U, at t=18, y=6\n\na_18: U, at t=19, y=7\n\na_19: U, at t=20, y=8\n\na_20: U, at t=21, y=9\n\nSo after 11 actions (t=10 to t=20), at t=21, y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions: for turns t=10 to t=20.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nt_1=10.\n\nSo with S,S,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U\n\nThat's 11 actions.\n\nFrom t=10 to t=20.\n\nIn the up-down version: a_10=U, a_11=D, then a_12 to a_20 U.\n\na_10=U: at t=10, action U, so at t=11, y=1\n\na_11=D: at t=11, action D, so at t=12, y=0\n\nThen a_12=U, t=13, y=1, same as before.\n\nSo same from there.\n\nIn this case, at t=11, I was on y=1, which is fine.\n\nBut both sequences work.\n\nPerhaps I can choose the stay sequence to avoid unnecessary movement.\n\nBut in terms of the car, it might not matter.\n\nAnother thing: at t=12, when I am at y=0, it is safe.\n\nThen going up.\n\nIn the sequence, when I go to y=1 at t=13, it is safe, etc.\n\nIs there any other unsafe time?\n\nFor example, freeway 8 at t=10 and 11, but I am not on it then.\n\nIn the up path, I reach y=8 at t=20, which is fine.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at t=18, y=6?

Actions from t=10 to t=19, 10 actions, then at t=20, y= y_10 + sum Δy = 0 + sum of 10 actions, each +1,0,-1.\n\nTo have y=9, since min increase is with 9 U and 1 S or D, but if I have a D, I need extra U, so min actions is 9 U, but with 10 actions, I can have 9 U and one S, or 10 U but y=10 not possible, max y=9.\n\ny=9, so I can have 9 U and one S, or 9 U and one D but D at some point would decrease, so I need 10 U? No, 10 U would go to y=10, but y<=9, so if at y=9, U does nothing.\n\nSimilarly, at y=0, D does nothing.\n\nSo with 10 actions, I can reach y=9 with, for example, 9 U and one S, or 10 U but at some point when y=9, U does nothing.\n\nBut the position: if I go up faster, I might reach earlier.\n\nFor example, suppose I start at t=10, y=0.\n\nIf I do U at t=10, t=11 y=1\n\nU at t=11, t=12 y=2, but at t=12 y=2 unsafe, cannot.\n\nIf I do S at t=10, t=11 y=0\n\nThen U at t=11, t=12 y=1, but y=1 at t=12 unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nThe only safe at t=12 is y=0.\n\nSo at t=12, must be y=0.\n\nThen from t=12 to t=20, 8 actions? t=12 to t=19 actions.\n\nAfter actions from t=12 to t=19, at t=20 y=?\n\nWith 8 actions, from y=0, max y=8, since 8 U.\n\nThen at t=20, y=8, not 9.\n\nThen I need another action to go to y=9 at t=21.\n\nSo min to reach y=9 is from y=0, 9 up actions, with possible waits.\n\nBut at t=12 y=0, I need to start from there.\n\nWith 9 actions from t=12 to t=20, reach at t=21.\n\nIf I could be at higher y at t=12, but I cannot.\n\nSo H=11 is indeed minimal.\n\nThus, the sequence.\n\nNow for the answer, I think I should write one.\n\nPerhaps the stay sequence is fine.\n\nIn the output, it should be the actions for each turn.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1=10.\n\nSo for example:\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nThen at turn 21, position (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, turn 19: U to y=8 at t=20? Let's list the actions with turns.\n\nThe actions are for turns starting from t_1.\n\nIn the answer format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for H=11, turns from t=10 to t=20.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut in the sequence above, I have 11 actions.\n\nTo write it:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }\n\nBut turn 19: U, then at turn 20, y=8, then action U at turn 20 to go to y=9 at turn 21.\n\nYes.\n\nWith the other sequence: Turn 10: U, Turn 11: D, then Turn 12 to 20: U each.\n\nBut in that case, at turn 11, I go down, but it's fine.\n\nI think the first one is simpler.\n\nIn the problem, it says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH=11.\n\nIn the sequence, I used S at the beginning.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nTo avoid the down action.\n\nBut both are minimal.\n\nNow, I think I should output one.\n\nPerhaps I can write the sequence.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 8, there was a car at (0,-11,right,6) at t=10, but since I am not on y=8 at that time, no issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11. This is achieved by staying at \\(y = 0\\) for turns 10 and 11 to avoid the unsafe conditions on freeways 1-5 at turn 12, then moving up one row per turn from turn 12 to turn 20.\n\n- At turn 10, staying (S) keeps the player at \\(y = 0\\), which is safe as it is not a freeway.\n- At turn 11, staying (S) again keeps the player at \\(y = 0\\), safe.\n- At turn 12, moving up (U) to \\(y = 1\\) is safe, as freeway 1 is unsafe only at turn 12, but the player is on \\(y = 0\\) at turn 12 (before the action).\n- From turns 13 to 20, moving up (U) each turn progresses the player to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 21. All intermediate positions are safe:\n  - Turns 13-17 (\\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\)): Freeways 1-5 are unsafe only at turn 12, so safe at these turns.\n  - Turn 18 (\\(y = 6\\)): Freeway 6 is always safe.\n  - Turn 19 (\\(y = 7\\)): Freeway 7 is always safe.\n  - Turn 20 (\\(y = 8\\)): Freeway 8 is unsafe at turns 10 and 11, but safe at turn 20.\n\nThe sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) by avoiding unnecessary movement and ensuring safety at all turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 12, and the player is at (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The grid has y from 0 to 9. The freeways (where cars are) are y=1 to y=8.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at turn T, and at that same turn T, the car on that freeway has its span including 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nImportant: When the player moves from y to y' at turn T, note that:\n- At turn T, the player is at y (starting position for that turn) and then moves to y' which is the position for turn T+1.\n- So at turn T, the player is on freeway y (if y is between 1 and 8) and must avoid the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n- When moving, at the moment of the move (turn T) we are still on the current row, and we will be on the next row at the next turn (T+1).\n\nGiven the car update rules:\n\nFor a car at turn t1 (current turn) with head h, tail τ, direction d, and speed s:\n\n- Left-moving (d = left): the car moves to the left. So at turn T (>= t1), the span becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n- Right-moving (d = right): the car moves to the right. So at turn T, the span becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]? \n  But note the initial representation: for right-moving, the head is the rightmost? Actually, the table says for right: (head, tail) and then the span becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]? \n\nWait, the problem says:\n- Left: initially [h, τ] (so h is the rightmost? because when moving left, the head is the leading part) then becomes [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt] -> so the entire segment moves left.\n- Right: initially [τ, h] -> meaning τ is the leftmost and h is the rightmost? Then the span at T is [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt].\n\nBut in the table, for right-moving cars, they are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For example, freeway 3: (48,37,right,12) -> so head=48, tail=37? But then the span is [37,48] at t1? Then at T, it becomes [37+12*(T-t1), 48+12*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left: (48,83,left,36) -> head=48, tail=83? That would make the car from 48 to 83? But that's a long car and moving left? Actually, 83>48, so if it's moving left, the head should be the leftmost? \n\nWait, the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then moves to [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt]. So if h is the head and τ is the tail, and the car is moving left, then the head is the front (which is the leftmost? because moving left). But if the car is moving left, the head should be the leftmost? Actually, in the example, for freeway 1: (48,83,left,36) -> at t1, the car is from 48 to 83? But then 48 is the left end? But when it moves left, the left end becomes 48 - s*dt, and the right end becomes 83 - s*dt.\n\nBut note: if the car is moving left, the head (front) is at the left? Actually, the problem does not specify which is left or right in terms of the numbers. We assume that the road is a number line, and 0 is the point we care about.\n\nSo we only care when the car's span includes 0 at the turn we are on that freeway.\n\nWe are at turn t1=12. We are going to simulate turns starting at t1.\n\nPlayer starts at y0 = 0 at turn 12.\n\nWe want to get to y=9. Note that y=0 and y=9 are safe (no cars). So we must avoid collisions only on y=1..8 at the turn when we are on that row.\n\nWe need the minimal number of turns H and the sequence.\n\nThe minimal H in terms of moves: we start at y=0 and need to get to y=9. The minimal moves without obstacles would be 9 moves (all U). But we have obstacles (cars) on the freeways.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway whose span includes 0 at that same turn T.\n\nWe are going to simulate the car positions at future turns.\n\nFirst, let's compute the car positions at turn T (relative to t1=12, so dt = T - 12).\n\nFor each freeway k (1 to 8), we have a list of cars.\n\nWe need to check for each freeway k and for each turn T, if there is a car on freeway k at turn T that covers 0.\n\nBut note: we are only concerned when the player is on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe are going to plan the player's moves.\n\nWe are at (0,0) at turn 12.\n\nWe can do:\n\n- U: go to y=1 at turn 13 (so at turn 12 we are on y=0, then we move to y=1 and that becomes our position at turn 13).\n- D: not useful because we are at 0, so we can't go below 0 -> so if we try D, we stay at 0? Actually, the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, and y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. So if we are at 0 and do D, we stay at 0? Actually, the problem says: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\" and then \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\". So if we are at 0 and do D, we get y_{t+1} = 0 - 1 = -1 -> but then clamped? The problem doesn't say clamped, it says \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\". So we must assume that moves that would take us out of bounds are not allowed? Or are they clamped? The problem doesn't specify. But note the update rule: we have the cases and then \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\". So I think we are to assume that the move is only valid if it stays in [0,9]. Therefore, at y=0, D is equivalent to S? Or is it invalid? The problem says: the action set is {U, D, S}. And the update is defined for each action. But if we do D at y=0, we would get -1 which is not in [0,9]. So probably we must avoid that. Similarly at y=9, U would give 10 -> invalid.\n\nSo we must design a sequence that never goes out of bounds. Therefore, at y=0, we cannot do D. Similarly, at y=9, we cannot do U.\n\nGiven that, at turn 12: we are at y=0, so we can only do U or S.\n\nWe want minimal H, so we want to go as fast as possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions.\n\nLet me compute the car positions at various turns.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, I'll write the cars and their positions at turn T (T>=12).\n\nDefine dt = T - 12.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (48,83,left,36)\n  At T: span = [48 - 36*dt, 83 - 36*dt]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (48,83,left,36) -> same as above.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: \n  car1: (48,37,right,12) -> wait, the representation is (head, tail). For right-moving, the problem says: initially [τ, h]? But the table says (head, tail) and then for right: \"Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\".\n\nBut what is the initial head and tail? The table says for freeway 3: (48,37,right,12). So head=48, tail=37? Then the initial span at t1=12 is [37,48]? Then at T: [37+12*dt, 48+12*dt]\n\nSimilarly, car2: (12,1,right,12) -> [1+12*dt, 12+12*dt]\ncar3: (-24,-35,right,12) -> [-35+12*dt, -24+12*dt]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? \n  It has the same three cars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 3 and 4.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (48,37,right,6) -> [37+6*dt, 48+6*dt]\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (48,37,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n  First car: [37+6*dt, 48+6*dt]\n  Second car: [-11+6*dt, 0+6*dt] -> [ -11+6*dt, 6*dt ]\n\nNow, we are concerned with when the car spans include 0.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k and for each turn T (starting at 12) whether there is a car that covers 0.\n\nBut note: we are going to simulate the player's moves. The player can only change by one unit per turn.\n\nWe are going to do a BFS (breadth-first search) over states (turn, y) to find the minimal steps to y=9.\n\nThe state: (T, y) where T is the current turn (starting at 12) and y in {0,1,...,9}. We start at (12,0). We want to reach any T with y=9.\n\nAt each state (T, y), we consider actions: U, D, S (if they keep y in [0,9]).\n\nBut note: when we are at state (T, y), that means at turn T we are at y. Then we choose an action that determines y_{T+1}.\n\nBut the collision condition: at turn T, if y is between 1 and 8, then we must not have a car on freeway y that covers 0 at turn T.\n\nSo at state (T, y) (which is our position at turn T), if y is in [1,8], we must check that at turn T, there is no car on freeway y that has a span covering 0.\n\nIf y=0 or 9, then no car -> safe.\n\nWe can simulate forward.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway and for each T (starting from 12) the safety.\n\nBut note: the turns we care about are from 12 up to ...? Since we are going to y=9, and minimal steps is at least 9, so T from 12 to 12+? maybe 12+20? But we can compute the car positions until we see that they are far away.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for each freeway k and for each turn T (starting from 12) whether 0 is covered by any car on that freeway.\n\nLet me do that for T from 12 to, say, 12+20 (which is 32) to be safe.\n\nFreeway 1: car: [48 - 36*dt, 83 - 36*dt]\n  0 is in [48-36*dt, 83-36*dt] if:\n  48 - 36*dt <= 0 <= 83 - 36*dt\n  => 36*dt >= 48 and 36*dt <= 83\n  => dt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.33 -> so dt>=2\n     and dt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 -> so dt<=2.\n\n  So only at dt=2: \n    at dt=2: [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11] -> 0 is in [-24,11] -> yes.\n\n  At dt=1: [48-36, 83-36] = [12,47] -> 0 not in.\n  At dt=3: [48-108, 83-108] = [-60,-25] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 1 is unsafe only at T=12+2=14.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1 -> unsafe only at T=14.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars.\n\nCar1: [37+12*dt, 48+12*dt]\n  0 in [37+12*dt, 48+12*dt]?\n  37+12*dt <=0<=48+12*dt -> \n  left: 12*dt <= -37 -> dt <= -37/12 -> impossible? because dt>=0 -> so never.\n\nCar2: [1+12*dt, 12+12*dt]\n  0 in [1+12*dt, 12+12*dt]?\n  1+12*dt <=0<=12+12*dt -> \n  left: 12*dt <= -1 -> impossible -> never.\n\nCar3: [-35+12*dt, -24+12*dt]\n  0 in [-35+12*dt, -24+12*dt]?\n  -35+12*dt <=0<=-24+12*dt\n  => 12*dt <=35 and 12*dt>=24\n  => dt>=24/12=2 and dt<=35/12≈2.916 -> so dt=2 and 3? but dt integer.\n\n  dt=2: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? yes, because the interval is closed? \n  dt=3: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\n  So car3 covers 0 at dt=2 -> T=14.\n\nTherefore, freeway 3 is unsafe at T=14 (only).\n\nBut note: there are three cars. At T=14, car3 covers 0. So at T=14, freeway 3 is unsafe.\n\nNow, what about other T? \n  At dt=0: T=12: \n      car1: [37,48] -> no\n      car2: [1,12] -> no\n      car3: [-35,-24] -> no\n  At dt=1: T=13:\n      car1: [49,60] -> no\n      car2: [13,24] -> no\n      car3: [-23,-12] -> no\n  At dt=2: T=14: car3: [-11,0] -> yes\n  At dt=3: T=15: car3: [1,12] -> no\n\nSo freeway 3: unsafe only at T=14.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3 -> unsafe only at T=14.\n\nFreeway 5: same -> unsafe only at T=14.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: [37+6*dt, 48+6*dt]\n  0 in [37+6*dt, 48+6*dt]?\n  37+6*dt <=0<=48+6*dt -> \n  left: 6*dt<=-37 -> impossible -> always safe.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6 -> always safe.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars.\n  First car: [37+6*dt, 48+6*dt] -> same as above, never covers 0.\n  Second car: [-11+6*dt, 0+6*dt] = [-11+6*dt, 6*dt]\n  0 in [-11+6*dt, 6*dt]?\n  This requires: -11+6*dt <=0<=6*dt\n  => 6*dt >=0 (always for dt>=0) and 6*dt>=11? -> wait, the condition is:\n      -11+6*dt <=0 and 0<=6*dt -> \n      => 6*dt <=11 and 6*dt>=0 -> so dt<=11/6≈1.83 -> so dt=0,1.\n\n  At dt=0: T=12: [-11,0] -> 0 is included? yes, because the interval is [a,b] and 0 is the right endpoint? \n      The car is from -11 to 0 at T=12 -> so 0 is included? yes.\n  At dt=1: T=13: [-11+6,0+6] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in this interval? yes.\n\n  At dt=2: T=14: [-11+12, 12] = [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\n  So freeway 8 is unsafe at T=12 and T=13.\n\nSummary of unsafe freeways at each turn:\n\nTurn T (absolute) | Freeways that are unsafe at T\nT=12 (dt=0):\n  freeway 8: unsafe (because of the second car: [ -11,0 ] at T=12 -> covers 0)\n  others: safe? \n      freeway 1: safe (dt=0: [48,83] -> no)\n      freeway 2: same\n      freeway 3: safe (as above)\n      freeway 4,5: same as 3 -> safe\n      freeway 6,7: safe\n      freeway 8: unsafe.\n\nT=13 (dt=1):\n  freeway 1: [48-36,83-36]=[12,47] -> safe\n  freeway 2: same -> safe\n  freeway 3: car3: [-23,-12] -> safe; others also safe -> safe\n  freeway 4,5: same -> safe\n  freeway 6: [37+6,48+6]=[43,54] -> safe\n  freeway 7: same -> safe\n  freeway 8: second car: [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6] -> unsafe.\n\nT=14 (dt=2):\n  freeway 1: [48-72,83-72]=[-24,11] -> 0 is in -> unsafe.\n  freeway 2: same -> unsafe.\n  freeway 3: car3: [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n  freeway 4,5: same -> unsafe.\n  freeway 6: [37+12,48+12]=[49,60] -> safe.\n  freeway 7: same -> safe.\n  freeway 8: [1,12] -> safe.\n\nT=15 (dt=3):\n  freeway 1: [48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25] -> safe.\n  freeway 2: safe.\n  freeway 3: car3: [1,12] -> safe.\n  freeway 4,5: safe.\n  freeway 6: [37+18,48+18]=[55,66] -> safe.\n  freeway 7: safe.\n  freeway 8: [7,18] -> safe.\n\nT=16 and beyond: no car covers 0? \n  For freeway 1,2: moving left and already passed? \n  freeway 3,4,5: car3 at dt=3 is [1,12] and moving right, so will never come back? \n  freeway 8: the second car at dt=2 is [1,12] and then moves right -> safe.\n\nSo from T=16 onward, all freeways are safe.\n\nBut note: we must avoid being on a freeway at an unsafe turn.\n\nWe are at turn 12 at y=0.\n\nWe want to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of moves is 9 (if we do U every turn). But we have to avoid the unsafe turns.\n\nLet's try to simulate:\n\nAt turn 12: we are at y=0 (safe). We can do:\n  Option 1: U -> then at turn 13 we will be at y=1.\n  Option 2: S -> then at turn 13 we are still at y=0.\n\nIf we do U at turn 12: \n  Then at turn 13, we are at y=1.\n  But at turn 13, freeway 1 is safe? yes (at T=13, freeway1 is safe) but freeway 8 is unsafe at T=13? but we are on freeway 1, not 8. So we only care about the freeway we are on.\n\nAt turn 13, if we are at y=1, then we are on freeway 1. And at T=13, freeway1 is safe (as computed: safe at T=13). So that's okay.\n\nThen at turn 13, we can do U again -> to y=2 at turn 14.\n\nBut at turn 14, we are at y=2. Now, freeway 2 at T=14 is unsafe! So if we are at freeway 2 at turn 14, we crash.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway 2 at turn 14.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being at y=2 at turn 14.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be at freeway 1,2,3,4,5 at turn 14? \n  But note: at turn 14, if we are at y=1, then we are on freeway1 -> unsafe.\n  if we are at y=2 -> freeway2 -> unsafe.\n  y=3 -> freeway3 -> unsafe at T=14.\n  y=4 -> freeway4 -> unsafe.\n  y=5 -> freeway5 -> unsafe.\n  y=6 -> freeway6 -> safe (at T=14, freeway6 is safe).\n  y=7 -> freeway7 -> safe.\n  y=8 -> freeway8 -> safe (at T=14, freeway8 is safe: [1,12] doesn't include 0).\n\nSo at turn 14, we must be either at y=0, y=6,7,8, or y=9? But we are moving from below.\n\nWe start at y=0 at turn 12.\n\nWe must plan so that at turn 14 we are not on freeways 1-5.\n\nBut we also have the constraint at turn 13: \n  At turn 13, we can be at y=0 (if we did S at turn12) or y=1 (if we did U at turn12) or even y=0 again if we did D? but we can't do D at y=0.\n\nSo only two choices at turn12: S or U.\n\nIf we do S at turn12: then at turn13 we are still at y=0 (safe). Then at turn13 we can do U -> to y=1 at turn14? but then at turn14, we are at y=1 -> unsafe.\n\nAlternatively, at turn13 (if we did S at turn12) we could do S again -> then at turn14 we are at y=0 (safe). But that delays.\n\nWe need to avoid being on freeways 1-5 at turn14.\n\nSo we must be at y>=6 at turn14? or at y=0? But we are going up.\n\nHow can we get to y>=6 by turn14? \n\nAt turn12: y=0.\nAt turn13: we can be at y=0 or y=1.\nAt turn14: from y=0: we can go to y=0 (S), y=1 (U), or if we were at y=1 at turn13, we can go to y=0 (D), y=1 (S), y=2 (U).\n\nBut we cannot get to y>=6 by turn14 from y=0 in two moves: maximum we can get is y=2 (if we do U at turn12 and then U at turn13: then at turn14 we are at y=2 -> which is unsafe).\n\nSo we cannot be at y>=6 at turn14.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=0 at turn14? \n\nBut then we are safe (y=0 is safe). Then we can start moving after turn14.\n\nSo one plan: \n  turn12: S -> at turn13: y=0\n  turn13: S -> at turn14: y=0\n  Then starting from turn14, we can move up.\n\nBut after turn14, the unsafe period is over? From turn15 onward, all freeways are safe.\n\nSo from turn14 at y=0, we can do 9 consecutive U moves? \n  turn14: U -> turn15: y=1\n  turn15: U -> turn16: y=2\n  ... until turn23: U -> then at turn23 we are at y=9? \n\nBut we start at turn14: y=0.\nAfter k U moves, we are at y=k at turn 14+k.\n\nWe want y=9 at turn14+9 = turn23.\n\nBut is that safe? \n\nAt turn15: we are at y=1. At T=15, freeway1 is safe? yes (from above: at T=15, freeway1 is safe). Similarly, freeway2 at T=16? \n\nWe need to check for each turn and each freeway we are on:\n\nAt turn15: y=1 -> freeway1: at T=15 (dt=15-12=3): freeway1: [48-36*3,83-36*3]=[48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25] -> safe.\n\nAt turn16: y=2 -> freeway2: at T=16 (dt=4): [48-36*4,83-36*4]=[48-144,83-144]=[-96,-61] -> safe.\n\nAt turn17: y=3 -> freeway3: at T=17 (dt=5): \n  car3: [-35+12*5, -24+12*5] = [-35+60, -24+60] = [25,36] -> safe? 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4 and 5 are the same -> safe.\n\nAt turn18: y=4 -> freeway4: same as above -> safe.\n\nAt turn19: y=5 -> freeway5: same -> safe.\n\nAt turn20: y=6 -> freeway6: at T=20 (dt=8): [37+6*8,48+6*8]=[37+48,48+48]=[85,96] -> safe.\n\nAt turn21: y=7 -> freeway7: same -> safe.\n\nAt turn22: y=8 -> freeway8: at T=22 (dt=10): \n  second car: [-11+6*10, 6*10] = [-11+60,60] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\nAt turn23: y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo that works. Total turns: from turn12 to turn23 -> H = 12? But note: the sequence is from turn12 to turn23, that's 12 turns? \n\nBut we are counting the turns: \n  We start at turn12: we do an action at turn12, then turn13, ... until the last action that gets us to y=9.\n\nWe are at (0,0) at turn12. \nWe do:\n  turn12: S -> at turn13 we are still at (0,0)\n  turn13: S -> at turn14 we are at (0,0)\n  then we do 9 U's: \n    turn14: U -> turn15: y=1\n    turn15: U -> turn16: y=2\n    turn16: U -> turn17: y=3\n    turn17: U -> turn18: y=4\n    turn18: U -> turn19: y=5\n    turn19: U -> turn20: y=6\n    turn20: U -> turn21: y=7\n    turn21: U -> turn22: y=8\n    turn22: U -> turn23: y=9\n\nSo we have 2 S's and 9 U's -> total 11 actions? \nBut we start at turn12 and do actions at turn12,13,...,22 -> that's 11 actions? and we reach at turn23.\n\nBut the problem asks for the minimal number of turns H. What is H? The sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1? \n\nThe problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that after H turns (i.e., after the last action) we are at (0,9). \n\nSo the number of actions is H. \n\nIn our plan: we have 11 actions: \n  turn12: S (t=0)\n  turn13: S (t=1)\n  turn14: U (t=2)\n  turn15: U (t=3)\n  ...\n  turn22: U (t=10)\n\nThen at turn23 (after 11 actions) we are at y=9.\n\nSo H=11.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWe must avoid being at y=1,2,3,4,5 at turn14. But we can be at y=6,7,8 at turn14? \n\nHow? We start at y=0 at turn12. To be at y=6 at turn14: that requires 6 moves in 2 steps? But we can only move one per turn. So maximum we can be at y=2 at turn14. So we cannot be at y=6 at turn14.\n\nTherefore, we must wait until turn14 is over.\n\nBut note: we can be at y=0 at turn14 (safe) and then move quickly. \n\nBut is there a way to be at y=9 earlier than turn23?\n\nWe start at turn12: y=0.\n\nWe have to avoid the unsafe freeways at turn12,13,14.\n\nAt turn12: we are at y=0 (safe). But if we move to y=1 at turn13, then at turn13 we are at y=1 -> freeway1: at T=13 is safe. Then at turn13, we can move to y=2 at turn14? but then at turn14 we are at y=2 -> unsafe.\n\nAlternatively, at turn13 (if we are at y=1) we can do S -> then at turn14 we are at y=1 -> unsafe (freeway1 at T=14 is unsafe).\n\nOr at turn13 (y=1) we do D -> to y=0 at turn14. Then at turn14 we are at y=0 (safe). Then we start moving. But that is the same as the previous plan: we end up at y=0 at turn14 and then do 9 U's -> same as before.\n\nBut wait: in the previous plan we did two S's at turn12 and turn13 to stay at y=0 until turn14.\n\nIn this alternative: we did U at turn12 (to y=1 at turn13) and then D at turn13 (to y=0 at turn14). Then we are at y=0 at turn14. Then same as before: 9 U's to get to y=9 at turn23.\n\nBut the sequence is different: \n  turn12: U\n  turn13: D\n  turn14: U\n  ... then 8 more U's.\n\nBut note: at turn13: we are at y=1 -> freeway1. At T=13, freeway1 is safe (as we saw: [12,47] doesn't include 0). So that's safe.\n\nThen at turn14: we go to y=0 (by D) and then we are safe.\n\nTotal actions: 1 (U) + 1 (D) + 9 (U) = 11 actions? But wait: the 9 U's: \n  turn14: U -> to y=1 at turn15\n  turn15: U -> to y=2 at turn16\n  ... \n  turn22: U -> to y=9 at turn23.\n\nBut the actions: \n  turn12: U\n  turn13: D\n  turn14: U\n  turn15: U\n  ... \n  turn22: U -> 11 actions.\n\nSame H=11.\n\nBut we have a down move? and then we have to go up again. So the net progress is the same.\n\nBut note: we can try to avoid the down move? \n\nAnother idea: can we get to y=3 or above by turn14? Only if we do U every time: \n  turn12: U -> y1=1 at turn13\n  turn13: U -> y2=2 at turn14 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nBut what if we do more than one move? No, we can only move one per turn.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at y=0 at turn14 and then move up quickly. But we still need 9 moves to go from 0 to 9.\n\nSo the minimal H is 11? \n\nBut wait: we are at y=0 at turn14. Then we do 9 moves: from turn14 to turn22 (9 actions) and we are at y=9 at turn23. So total from turn12 to turn22: 11 actions? \n\nBut the starting turn is t1=12, and we do actions at turns 12,13,...,22 (11 actions) and then at turn23 we are at (0,9). \n\nIs there a way to get to y=9 earlier?\n\nNote: we can start moving earlier if we can avoid the unsafe spots.\n\nAt turn12: we are at y=0 -> safe. We can go to y=1 at turn13 -> safe (because at turn13, freeway1 is safe). Then at turn13, we cannot go to y=2 at turn14 because that freeway is unsafe. But we can go to y=1? (stay) or to y=0? \n\nBut if we stay at y=1 at turn14, that is unsafe (freeway1 at T=14 is unsafe). So we must leave freeway1 at turn14? \n\nBut we can only move to y=0 or y=2? \n  y=0: safe (at turn14, y=0 is safe)\n  y=2: unsafe (freeway2 at T=14 is unsafe)\n\nSo the only safe move at turn13 (if we are at y=1) is to go down to y=0 at turn14.\n\nThen we are at y=0 at turn14. Then we have to do 9 moves to get to y=9.\n\nSo we cannot avoid having to do 9 moves after turn14.\n\nThus minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let me check if we can do better by going slower? No, because we want minimal H.\n\nAlternatively, can we get to y=9 in fewer than 11 actions? \n\nThe absolute minimum is 9 actions (if no cars). But because of the unsafe turns at 12,13,14, we have to wait two turns? \n\nBut note: we are forced to be at y=0 at turn12, and we cannot be on freeways 1-5 at turn14. So we have to spend two turns waiting (either S at turn12 and S at turn13, or U and then D) and then 9 moves. \n\nSo 2+9=11.\n\nBut wait: at turn12, we cannot go to freeway8 because at T=12, freeway8 is unsafe? But we are starting at y=0. We don't go to freeway8 until we are at y=8.\n\nBut we are not at freeway8 at turn12.\n\nSo the only constraint is that we must not be on freeways 1-5 at turn14 and freeway8 at turns12 and13? But we are not on freeway8 at turn12 because we are at y=0.\n\nAt turn13: if we are at y=1, that's freeway1 -> safe at T=13. Then we go down to y=0 at turn14.\n\nBut what if we try to go to freeway6,7,8 earlier? \n\nFor example: \n  turn12: U -> turn13: y=1 (safe)\n  turn13: U -> turn14: y=2 -> unsafe (freeway2 at T=14 unsafe) -> not allowed.\n\nSo we cannot jump to freeway6 in two moves.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nWe have two valid sequences:\n\nSequence 1 (stay at 0 for two turns then go up):\n  turn12: S\n  turn13: S\n  turn14: U\n  turn15: U\n  turn16: U\n  turn17: U\n  turn18: U\n  turn19: U\n  turn20: U\n  turn21: U\n  turn22: U\n\nSequence 2 (go up then down then up):\n  turn12: U\n  turn13: D\n  turn14: U\n  turn15: U\n  turn16: U\n  turn17: U\n  turn18: U\n  turn19: U\n  turn20: U\n  turn21: U\n  turn22: U\n\nBut note: in sequence 2, at turn13 we are at y=1 (freeway1) and at turn14 we are at y=0 (so not on any freeway). Then from turn14 we start going up.\n\nBoth are 11 actions.\n\nBut we must check the entire path for collisions.\n\nCheck sequence 1:\n\nTurn12: at y=0 -> safe.\nAction: S -> so at turn13: y=0.\n\nTurn13: at y=0 -> safe.\nAction: S -> at turn14: y=0.\n\nTurn14: at y=0 -> safe.\nAction: U -> at turn15: y=1.\n\nAt turn15: we are at y=1 -> freeway1. At T=15 (dt=3): freeway1: [48-36*3,83-36*3]=[-60,-25] -> safe.\n\nAction: U -> turn16: y=2 -> freeway2. At T=16 (dt=4): [48-36*4,83-36*4]=[-96,-61] -> safe.\n\nAction: U -> turn17: y=3 -> freeway3. At T=17 (dt=5): \n  freeway3: car3: [-35+12*5, -24+12*5]=[-35+60,-24+60]=[25,36] -> safe.\n\nAction: U -> turn18: y=4 -> freeway4. At T=18 (dt=6): freeway4 same as freeway3? \n  car3: [-35+12*6, -24+12*6]=[-35+72,-24+72]=[37,48] -> safe.\n\nAction: U -> turn19: y=5 -> freeway5. At T=19 (dt=7): car3: [-35+84, -24+84]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\nAction: U -> turn20: y=6 -> freeway6. At T=20 (dt=8): [37+6*8,48+6*8]=[37+48,48+48]=[85,96] -> safe.\n\nAction: U -> turn21: y=7 -> freeway7. At T=21 (dt=9): [37+54,48+54]=[91,102] -> safe.\n\nAction: U -> turn22: y=8 -> freeway8. At T=22 (dt=10): \n  second car: [-11+6*10, 6*10] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\nAction: U -> turn23: y=9 -> safe.\n\nNow sequence 2:\n\nTurn12: at y=0 -> safe. Action: U -> turn13: y=1.\nTurn13: at y=1 -> freeway1. T=13 (dt=1): [48-36,83-36]=[12,47] -> safe. Action: D -> turn14: y=0.\nTurn14: at y=0 -> safe. Action: U -> turn15: y=1. ... same as sequence1 from turn14 onward.\n\nBut at turn15: we are at y=1 -> same as above.\n\nSo both are safe.\n\nBut we want minimal H, and both have H=11.\n\nIs there a sequence with H=10?\n\nThat would mean we reach y=9 at turn22? \n\nWe start at turn12: y=0.\n\nAfter 10 actions (at turn21) we would be at y=9? \n\nBut we have to account for the two turns of waiting? \n\nSuppose we do:\n\nturn12: U -> turn13: y=1\nturn13: D -> turn14: y=0\nthen we need to go from y=0 at turn14 to y=9 at turn22? that is 9 moves? so 9 actions: from turn14 to turn22? \n  turn14: U -> turn15: y=1\n  turn15: U -> turn16: y=2\n  ...\n  turn22: U -> turn23: y=9\n\nSo we reach at turn23, not turn22. \n\nTo reach y=9 at turn22, we would have to be at y=8 at turn21. \n\nBut in 10 actions? \n\nThe sequence would have to be:\n\nAction0 (turn12): ... \nAction9 (turn21): ... \n\nAnd then at turn22 we are at y=9.\n\nBut we start at turn12: y=0.\n\nThe net displacement must be +9.\n\nEach U: +1, D: -1, S: 0.\n\nSo the sum of the moves must be +9.\n\nWe have 10 actions. Let u be the number of U, d be the number of D, s be the number of S. Then u - d = 9, and u+d+s=10.\n\nThen 2u + s = 19 -> so u must be at least 9 (if s=1, then 2u=18 -> u=9, then d=0, s=1) -> then u=9, s=1, d=0.\n\nSo we have 9 U and 1 S.\n\nNow we must arrange the sequence so that we never go out of bounds and avoid collisions.\n\nWe must avoid being at freeways 1-5 at turn14 and freeway8 at turn12 and turn13? \n\nBut we are at y=0 at turn12: safe.\n\nWe do one S: we can do the S at some turn. \n\nBut if we do the S at turn12: then at turn13: y=0. Then we do 9 U's: \n  turn13: U -> turn14: y=1 -> but at turn14, freeway1 is unsafe -> crash.\n\nIf we do the S at turn13: then at turn13: we do S -> so from turn12: we do U at turn12 -> to y=1 at turn13. Then at turn13 we do S -> then at turn14 we are at y=1 -> unsafe.\n\nIf we do the S at turn14: then at turn14: we are at y=1 (if we did U at turn12 and U at turn13) -> but at turn14 we are at y=1 -> unsafe.\n\nAlternatively, we do the S later? \n\nBut we have to be at y=9 at turn22. \n\nThe moves: we do 9 U and 1 S. The S can be at any turn. But we must not be at an unsafe state.\n\nSuppose we do the S at turn19 (for example). Then the sequence:\n\nturn12: U -> y=1 at turn13 (safe: freeway1 at T=13 safe)\nturn13: U -> y=2 at turn14 -> unsafe! (freeway2 at T=14 unsafe) -> not allowed.\n\nIf we do the S at turn12: then we are at y=0 at turn13. Then turn13: U -> y=1 at turn14 -> unsafe.\n\nIf we do the S at turn14: then we have to be at turn14 at y=2? because we did U at turn12 and U at turn13: so at turn14 we start at y=2 -> then we do S -> stay at y=2 -> but then at turn14 we are at y=2 -> unsafe.\n\nSo wherever we put the S, we will be at y=1 or 2 at turn14? \n\nThe only way to avoid being at freeways 1-5 at turn14 is to be at y=0 at turn14. But that requires that at turn13 we are at y=0 and we do S (so stay at y=0) or we are at y=1 and we do D (to y=0). \n\nBut if we do D, then that uses a D move, which we don't have in this 10-action plan (we only have U and S).\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=0 at turn14. To be at y=0 at turn14, we must have at turn13: y=0 and then we do S at turn13? \n\nBut then the actions:\n\nturn12: we must do an action that leaves us at y=0 at turn13. So we do S at turn12 -> then turn13: y=0.\nturn13: S -> then turn14: y=0.\n\nThen we have 8 actions left? But we need 9 U's? we only have 8 actions left? \n\nWe have 10 actions total. We used 2 (S at turn12 and S at turn13). Then we have 8 actions. We need 9 U's to get to y=9? but we only have 8 moves? so we can only get to y=8 at turn22? \n\nNot enough.\n\nAlternatively, if we do U at turn12 and then D at turn13: but that uses a D. Then we have 8 moves left and we need to get from y=0 at turn14 to y=9: which requires 9 moves -> so we need 9 more actions? total 11.\n\nSo we cannot do it in 10 actions.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow we have two sequences. We can choose either.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence\". So either is acceptable.\n\nI'll choose the first one: staying at 0 for two turns then going up.\n\nBut we must write the actions for turns starting at t1=12.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 12: S\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\n\nTotal 11 actions.\n\nBut note: the last action (turn22: U) leads to y=9 at turn23.\n\nNow, we must write in the answer format.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nSo t from 0 to H-1.\n\nIn our case, H=11.\n\nSo:\n\nt=0: turn12 -> S\nt=1: turn13 -> S\nt=2: turn14 -> U\nt=3: turn15 -> U\nt=4: turn16 -> U\nt=5: turn17 -> U\nt=6: turn18 -> U\nt=7: turn19 -> U\nt=8: turn20 -> U\nt=9: turn21 -> U\nt=10: turn22 -> U\n\nBut the answer format should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 12: S\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\n\nBut note: the sequence ends at turn22? and then at turn23 we are at (0,9). That is correct.\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: S\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\n}\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have 11 actions. Is H the number of actions? Yes, the sequence has H actions.\n\nSo this is the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by staying at \\(y = 0\\) during turns 12 and 13 (when freeway 8 is unsafe at turns 12 and 13, and freeways 1-5 are unsafe at turn 14), then moving up consecutively from turn 14 onwards.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n- Turns 12 and 13: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\), avoiding collisions as \\(y = 0\\) has no cars.\n- Turns 14 to 22: Move up (U) each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 23.\n\nThe car positions are safe for this path:\n- At turn 15 (\\(y=1\\)): Freeway 1 car at \\([-60, -25]\\) (safe).\n- At turn 16 (\\(y=2\\)): Freeway 2 car at \\([-96, -61]\\) (safe).\n- At turn 17 (\\(y=3\\)): Freeway 3 car at \\([25, 36]\\) (safe).\n- At turn 18 (\\(y=4\\)): Freeway 4 car at \\([37, 48]\\) (safe).\n- At turn 19 (\\(y=5\\)): Freeway 5 car at \\([49, 60]\\) (safe).\n- At turn 20 (\\(y=6\\)): Freeway 6 car at \\([85, 96]\\) (safe).\n- At turn 21 (\\(y=7\\)): Freeway 7 car at \\([91, 102]\\) (safe).\n- At turn 22 (\\(y=8\\)): Freeway 8 car at \\([49, 60]\\) (safe).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: S\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 14, and the player is at (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns without colliding with any car on the freeways (y=1 to 8) at the turn when the player is on that freeway.\n\nImportant note: Collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn the player is on a freeway row y (which is between 1 and 8) and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that exact turn.\n\nAlso note: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} (by action U or D) at turn T, at turn T the player is still on row y_T. Then at turn T+1, the player moves to row y_{T+1}. So we only check the freeway corresponding to the row we are on at each turn.\n\nWe are starting at y=0 (which is not a freeway, so no collision check at turn t1=14). We need to go to y=9 (also not a freeway).\n\nThe freeways are rows 1 to 8. Each freeway has one or more cars. Each car is defined by (head, tail, direction, speed). The update for a car from turn t1 to a future turn T (where T>t1) is:\n\n- For left-moving (d = left): the span at T is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n- For right-moving (d = right): the span at T is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: in the input for freeway 3,4,5,6,7,8, we see multiple cars. We have to check for every car on the freeway we are on at turn T.\n\nCollision condition at turn T: if the player is on freeway row y (so y between 1 and 8) and for any car on that freeway, the span at turn T includes 0 (i.e., the car covers the x=0 position at that turn).\n\nOur actions: U (up: y increases by 1), D (down: y decreases by 1), S (stay: y remains same). We cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nGoal: minimal H (number of turns) and the sequence of actions from turn t1 (turn 14) to turn t1+H-1 such that at the end we are at y=9.\n\nSince we start at 0 and need to go to 9, the minimal number of moves without any obstacles would be 9 moves (all U). However, we have obstacles (cars) on the freeways. We might have to wait (S) or even go down (D) to avoid collisions.\n\nWe are to output the sequence of actions for turns starting at t1 (14) until the turn when we first reach 9.\n\nApproach:\n\nWe can model this as a state space: (turn, y) where turn = t1, t1+1, ... and y in [0,9]. We want to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions to go from (14,0) to (14+H-1,9).\n\nBut note: the turn index matters because the car positions depend on the turn (specifically, the number of steps from t1: let dt = T - t1).\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over the state (y, dt) where dt is the number of turns elapsed since t1 (so at dt=0, we are at turn 14). But note that the state should include the current y and the current turn (or equivalently dt). However, since the car positions at a given freeway at a future turn T (which is 14+dt) depend solely on dt, we can compute for each freeway and for each car the span at dt.\n\nWe are only concerned when we are on a freeway (y from 1 to 8) at a particular dt (which corresponds to turn T=14+dt). Then we check if at that (y, dt) we would collide with any car on that freeway.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway (row 1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, the set of dt (nonnegative integers) for which the car's span includes 0.\n\nBut note: the same freeway has multiple cars. So for a given freeway i and a given dt, if there exists at least one car on freeway i such that 0 is in the span at dt, then that freeway at that dt is blocked.\n\nHowever, we are only on a freeway at a specific dt if we are at row i at that dt.\n\nSo we can precompute a set of bad (y, dt) for y in {1,2,...,8} and dt>=0.\n\nThen, we run BFS:\n\nState: (y, dt)  [dt is the number of steps from the start (turn 14), so at dt=0, we are at (0,0)]\nWe start at (0,0) at dt=0.\n\nWe want to reach (9, dt) for some dt.\n\nActions: U, D, S. But note:\n\n- U: from (y, dt) -> (y+1, dt+1)  [if y+1<=9]\n- D: from (y, dt) -> (y-1, dt+1)  [if y-1>=0]\n- S: from (y, dt) -> (y, dt+1)\n\nBut we must avoid states where:\n\n- If the new state has y in {1,2,...,8} and (y, dt+1) is bad (i.e., at that freeway and at that dt+1, there is a car covering 0), then we cannot go to that state.\n\nAlso note: the starting state (0,0) is safe because y=0 is not a freeway.\n\nSimilarly, the goal state (9, dt) is safe because y=9 is not a freeway.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Precomputation: for each freeway i (1 to 8) and each car on that freeway, compute the set of dt (>=0) for which the car covers x=0.\n\n   For a car on freeway i (we don't need i for the condition, but we use i to mark the bad state for that row):\n\n   For left-moving car: (h, tau, d='left', s)\n        Span at dt: [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]   -> note: since left-moving, the head is at the right? Actually, the input says for left: initial span [h, tau] -> then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. But note: in the input, for freeway 1: (48,83,left,36). So at dt=0: [48,83]. Then at dt=1: [48-36, 83-36] = [12,47]. We need 0 to be in [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. Since the car is moving left, and the span is [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt] and h < tau? Actually, in the input for left: the head is 48 and tail is 83? That would be if the car is from 48 to 83 (which is increasing) but the car is moving left? \n\n    Let me clarify: the description says:\n        Left-moving: Span(t1)= [h, tau] -> at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n        Right-moving: [Span(t1)= [tau, h] -> at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n    So for left-moving, the initial span is [h, tau] and we assume h <= tau? But in freeway1: (48,83,left,36): h=48, tau=83 -> so the car occupies from 48 to 83? Then at T, it moves left so the entire segment shifts left by s*(T-t1). Then the condition for 0 being in the span is:\n        h - s*dt <= 0 <= tau - s*dt   -> but note: because the car is moving left, the entire segment is decreasing.\n\n    However, wait: the input for freeway 3 has a car (-24,-35,right,12). For right-moving: the initial span is [tau, h] = [-35, -24]? Then at T: [ -35 + 12*dt, -24 + 12*dt]. \n\n    So for a left-moving car: condition: h - s*dt <= 0 <= tau - s*dt? But note: if h <= tau, then the interval [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt] is increasing? Actually, no: because we subtract s*dt, the entire interval shifts left. But the condition is that 0 must be between the left end and the right end. However, the representation [a,b] with a<=b? \n\n    Actually, the problem says \"the span\" and for left-moving it is [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. But if h < tau, then the car is from h to tau (so a segment of length tau-h+1?) and then after shifting, it is from h-s*dt to tau-s*dt. So the condition is:\n\n        h - s*dt <= 0 <= tau - s*dt\n\n    But note: if the car is long, it might be that h-s*dt > tau-s*dt? Actually, no: because h < tau (as per the example: 48<83) so the interval is [48,83] at dt=0, then at dt=1: [12,47]. So the condition for 0 to be in the span is:\n\n        h - s*dt <= 0 <= tau - s*dt   -> and note that h<=tau so the interval is well-defined.\n\n    However, what if h>tau? The problem doesn't specify that h<=tau for left-moving? Let me check the example: freeway1: (48,83,left,36) -> so h=48, tau=83, so h<tau. Similarly, freeway3: (48,37,right,12) -> for right-moving, the initial span is [tau, h] = [37,48] (so tau<=h). \n\n    So we can assume:\n\n        For left-moving: h <= tau? Actually, the example: (48,83) -> 48<83 -> so the car goes from 48 to 83 (which is 36 units long? 83-48+1=36? but the car length is 36? Actually, the car length = 83-48+1 = 36? and speed 36 -> so in one turn, it moves 36 units, meaning the entire car shifts by 36. Then at dt=1, the car is at [12,47]. Then at dt=2: [12-36,47-36] = [-24,11]. Then at dt=3: [-60, -25]. \n\n    Condition for left-moving: \n        h - s*dt <= 0 <= tau - s*dt   -> and since h<=tau, we have h-s*dt <= tau-s*dt.\n\n    For right-moving: the initial span is [tau, h] and we assume tau<=h. Then at T: [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]. Condition for 0 in the span: tau + s*dt <= 0 <= h + s*dt.\n\n    But wait: in freeway8: (0,-11,right,6). This is a right-moving car. The initial span: [tau, h] = [-11,0]. Then at T: [-11+6*dt, 0+6*dt]. Condition for 0: \n        -11+6*dt <= 0 <= 0+6*dt -> which simplifies to 0<=6*dt and 6*dt>=11? Actually, the condition is two inequalities:\n\n        -11+6*dt <= 0  -> 6*dt<=11 -> dt<=11/6 -> dt<=1 (since dt integer, so dt=0,1)\n        and 0 <= 6*dt -> dt>=0.\n\n        So at dt=0: [-11,0] -> 0 is in [ -11,0] (because 0 is the upper bound) -> so yes, at dt=0, 0 is in the span? But note: the car at dt=0: [-11,0] -> the car occupies from -11 to 0, so x=0 is included.\n\n        At dt=1: [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6] -> so yes.\n\n        At dt=2: [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> no.\n\n    So for freeway8, the car (0,-11,right,6) blocks dt=0 and dt=1? But note: we are at turn T=14+dt. At the start (turn14, dt=0): we are at y=0, so we are not on freeway8. But if we are at freeway8 at dt=0 (turn14) then we would collide? But the problem says: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y and the car on that freeway has 0 in its span at T, then collision.\n\n    However, note the car list for freeway8: two cars: \n        (48,37,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\n    The first car: (48,37,right,6) -> initial span [37,48]? Then at T: [37+6*dt, 48+6*dt]. Condition for 0: \n        37+6*dt <= 0 <= 48+6*dt -> but 37+6*dt>=37>0 -> so 0 is never in this span.\n\n    The second car: (0,-11,right,6) -> as above, blocks at dt=0 and dt=1.\n\n    Therefore, freeway8 is blocked at dt=0 and dt=1.\n\n2. Precompute for each freeway i (1..8) the set of dt (>=0) for which there is at least one car that covers 0.\n\n   We'll create a 2D list: blocked[i][dt] for i in 1..8 and dt from 0 up to a limit? We don't know the limit for dt. But we are going to run BFS until we reach y=9. The minimal H is at least 9 (if we go straight up) but we might have to wait, so we set a reasonable limit for dt, say 50? But we can compute dynamically.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute for each freeway the set of dt that are blocked (as a set) and then in the BFS, when we are at state (y, dt) and we are going to move to (y', dt+1), then if y' is between 1 and 8, we check if dt+1 is in the blocked set for freeway y'. If it is, then we skip that state.\n\n   Steps for precomputation:\n\n   For freeway i in [1,8]:\n        bad_dts = set()\n        for each car in freeway i:\n            if car is left-moving (d='left'):\n                h = car[0]; tau = car[1]; s = car[3]\n                # condition: h - s*dt <= 0 <= tau - s*dt\n                # => 0 >= h - s*dt -> s*dt >= h -> dt >= ceil(h/s)   if s>0? \n                # and 0 <= tau - s*dt -> s*dt <= tau -> dt <= floor(tau/s)\n                # So dt must satisfy: ceil(h/s) <= dt <= floor(tau/s)   [if h>0, then we need dt>=ceil(h/s) and if tau<0 then no solution?]\n\n                Actually, we can solve:\n\n                h - s*dt <= 0   => dt >= h/s   (if s>0, which it is) -> so dt_min = ceil(h/s) if h/s is not integer, but note: if h is negative, then h/s is negative and dt>=negative -> always true? So we must consider:\n\n                Actually, the condition is two inequalities:\n\n                (1) h - s*dt <= 0  -> dt >= h/s   (since s>0)\n                (2) 0 <= tau - s*dt -> s*dt <= tau -> dt <= tau/s\n\n                So we require: h/s <= dt <= tau/s.\n\n                But note: if h/s is not integer, then dt_min = ceil(h/s) if h>0? Actually, dt is integer and nonnegative.\n\n                We can iterate dt from max(0, ceil(h/s)) to floor(tau/s) (if tau/s>=0). If tau/s <0, then no dt.\n\n                However, note: if h is negative, then h/s is negative, so dt>=ceil(negative) = 0? Actually, ceil of a negative number? We are only considering dt>=0.\n\n                So:\n\n                    lower_bound = ceil(h/s) if h>0? Actually, if h is negative, then h/s is negative and the inequality dt>=h/s is always true for nonnegative dt.\n\n                So:\n\n                    dt_min = max(0, ceil(h/s))   but wait: if h is negative, then we set dt_min=0? But the condition is dt>=h/s -> which is always true for dt>=0.\n\n                Similarly, dt_max = floor(tau/s)   but if tau is negative, then the condition dt<=tau/s becomes dt<=negative -> which is impossible? Then no dt.\n\n                However, consider: if h is negative and tau is positive? Then the car at dt=0: [h, tau] -> which includes 0? \n\n                Example: h=-10, tau=10 -> then condition: -10 - s*dt <=0<=10-s*dt -> \n                    -10 - s*dt <=0 -> always true for dt>=0? \n                    0<=10-s*dt -> s*dt<=10 -> dt<=10/s.\n\n                So the condition is: dt in [0, floor(10/s)].\n\n                Therefore, we can write:\n\n                    dt_min = 0 if h <= 0, else ceil(h/s)   [but note: if h>0, then we require dt>=ceil(h/s), and if h<=0, then the left condition is automatically satisfied for dt>=0].\n\n                    dt_max = floor(tau/s)   [if tau>=0, then floor(tau/s) is nonnegative; if tau<0, then no solution?]\n\n                But wait: if tau is negative, then the condition 0<=tau-s*dt is 0<=negative - positive -> false. So indeed, if tau<0, then no dt satisfies the condition.\n\n                However, note: in the example freeway8: the car (0,-11,right,6) is right-moving, so we don't use this for left. We are doing left-moving here.\n\n            Similarly, for right-moving car (d='right'):\n                The car: (h, tau) but note the initial span is [tau, h] (and we assume tau<=h). Then at dt: [tau+s*dt, h+s*dt]. Condition for 0: \n                    tau+s*dt <= 0 <= h+s*dt\n                -> \n                    tau+s*dt <=0 -> s*dt <= -tau -> dt <= floor(-tau/s)   [if tau<=0, then -tau>=0, so we get an upper bound; if tau>0, then this becomes negative -> impossible?]\n                    and 0<=h+s*dt -> dt >= ceil(-h/s)   [if h>=0, then -h/s<=0 -> then dt>=ceil(negative) = 0?]\n\n                Actually:\n\n                    Condition 1: tau+s*dt <=0 -> dt <= ceil( (-tau-1)/s ) ??? \n\n                Let me break it:\n\n                    Condition 1: s*dt <= -tau   -> dt <= (-tau)/s   -> so dt_max = floor((-tau)/s)   [if (-tau) is positive? if tau is negative, then -tau is positive]\n\n                    Condition 2: h+s*dt>=0 -> s*dt>=-h -> dt>= ceil(-h/s)   [if h is positive, then -h/s is negative -> so dt>=ceil(negative)=0; if h is negative, then -h/s is positive -> then dt>=ceil(positive)]\n\n                Example: the car (0,-11,right,6): \n                    tau = -11, h = 0? \n                    Condition 1: dt <= (-(-11))/6 = 11/6 -> dt<=1.833 -> so dt_max=1 (floor(11/6)=1? but we use floor for integer dt? Actually, we need the largest integer dt such that s*dt<=-tau -> 6*dt<=11 -> dt<=1 (since 6*1=6<=11, 6*2=12>11 -> so dt_max=1).\n                    Condition 2: dt>= ceil(-0/6)=ceil(0)=0.\n                    So dt in [0,1].\n\n                Therefore, for right-moving:\n\n                    dt_min = ceil( (-h)/s )   [if (-h)>=0, then this is nonnegative; if h<=0, then -h>=0, so we compute ceil(-h/s); if h>0, then -h/s<=0 -> then ceil(-h/s)=0?]\n\n                    But note: if h is negative, then -h is positive -> then we require dt>=ceil(-h/s). If h is positive, then -h is negative -> then ceil(negative) is negative -> but we take max(0, ceil(-h/s))? \n\n                Actually, we can do:\n\n                    dt_min = max(0, ceil(-h/s))   [because if -h/s is negative, then ceil(-h/s) is negative, so max(0, ...)=0]\n\n                    dt_max = floor( (-tau)/s )   [if tau is negative, then -tau is positive; if tau is positive, then -tau is negative -> then floor(negative) is negative -> so we set dt_max = -1? meaning no solution?]\n\n                But if tau is positive, then condition1: s*dt<=-tau -> which is negative? then impossible. So:\n\n                    If tau>0, then condition1 fails? because s*dt is nonnegative and -tau is negative -> then condition1: nonnegative <= negative -> false. So no solution.\n\n                Therefore, for right-moving:\n\n                    if tau > 0: then no dt (because the entire car is to the right of 0 and moving right, so 0 is never covered).\n\n                    if tau<=0:\n                        dt_min = max(0, ceil(-h/s))\n                        dt_max = floor(-tau/s)   [because -tau>=0]\n\n                    But note: also we require that condition1 and condition2 hold simultaneously. And we must have dt_min<=dt_max.\n\n                However, we must check: if h is negative? then -h is positive -> so dt_min = ceil(-h/s). And if tau is negative, then -tau is positive -> dt_max = floor(-tau/s). Then the valid dt are integers in [dt_min, dt_max] if dt_min<=dt_max.\n\n        But note: the example (0,-11,right,6): \n            tau = -11 (<=0) -> dt_max = floor(11/6)=1\n            h=0 -> dt_min = max(0, ceil(0/6))=0\n            so dt in [0,1] -> which is {0,1}.\n\n        Another example: (48,37,right,6): \n            This car: note the input says (48,37,right,6) -> but wait, the input for right-moving: the head is the second number? Actually, the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed) -> but the description for right-moving says: \"Span(t1)= [tau, h]\". So in the input, the first number is head? and the second is tail? \n\n        The input says: \n            Freeway 3: (48,37,right,12) -> so head=48, tail=37? Then for right-moving, the initial span is [tau, h] = [37,48]. Then condition for 0: \n                37+s*dt<=0<=48+s*dt -> \n                    37+12*dt<=0 -> 12*dt<=-37 -> impossible (since 12*dt>=0). So no solution.\n\n        Therefore, for the car (48,37,right,12) on freeway3, it never blocks 0.\n\n        Similarly, (12,1,right,12): initial span [1,12] -> condition: 1+12*dt<=0<=12+12*dt -> first condition: 1+12*dt<=0 -> 12*dt<=-1 -> impossible.\n\n        And (-24,-35,right,12): wait, the input says (-24,-35,right,12). How to interpret? \n            For right-moving: the initial span is [tau, h] = [-35, -24]. Then condition: \n                -35+12*dt<=0<=-24+12*dt\n            -> \n                -35+12*dt<=0 -> 12*dt<=35 -> dt<=35/12=2.916 -> dt<=2\n                and 0<=-24+12*dt -> 12*dt>=24 -> dt>=2.\n            So dt=2.\n\n        Therefore, for freeway3, we have one car that blocks at dt=2: the car (-24,-35,right,12).\n\n        But note: freeway3 has three cars: \n            (48,37,right,12): no blocking\n            (12,1,right,12): no blocking\n            (-24,-35,right,12): blocks at dt=2.\n\n        So freeway3 is blocked at dt=2.\n\n        Similarly, freeway4 and 5 have the same cars? So they are also blocked at dt=2.\n\n        Freeway6 and 7: only one car: (48,37,right,6) -> which we saw never blocks.\n\n        Freeway8: two cars: \n            (48,37,right,6): no blocking\n            (0,-11,right,6): blocks at dt=0 and dt=1.\n\n        Freeway1 and 2: one car: (48,83,left,36). Condition for left-moving:\n            Condition: h - s*dt <=0<= tau - s*dt -> 48-36*dt<=0<=83-36*dt\n            -> \n                48-36*dt<=0 -> 36*dt>=48 -> dt>= ceil(48/36)=ceil(4/3)=2\n                0<=83-36*dt -> 36*dt<=83 -> dt<= floor(83/36)=2 (because 36*2=72<=83, 36*3=108>83)\n            So dt in [2,2] -> only dt=2.\n\n        Therefore, freeway1 and 2 are blocked at dt=2.\n\n        Summary:\n\n            freeway1: {2}\n            freeway2: {2}\n            freeway3: {2}   (from the third car: (-24,-35,right,12) at dt=2)\n            freeway4: {2}   (same as freeway3)\n            freeway5: {2}   (same)\n            freeway6: {}    (no blocking)\n            freeway7: {}    (no blocking)\n            freeway8: {0,1} (from the second car)\n\n        We'll represent:\n\n            blocked = {\n                1: {2},\n                2: {2},\n                3: {2},\n                4: {2},\n                5: {2},\n                6: set(),\n                7: set(),\n                8: {0,1}\n            }\n\n3. BFS:\n\n   We'll use a queue: each state is (y, dt) and we record the path (or at least the previous action to rebuild the path). We also want minimal dt (which is the number of turns) to reach (9, dt).\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Let dist[y][dt] = minimum number of steps (which is dt) to reach (y,dt) [but we are counting dt as the steps, so we don't need an extra dist array?]\n\n        We start at (0,0) with dt=0.\n\n        We use a queue: (y, dt, path) where path is the list of actions from the start? But we don't want to store the whole path for each state because the state space might be large.\n\n        Alternatively, we can store the previous state and the action taken. Then we backtrack.\n\n        We'll create:\n\n            parent[(y,dt)] = (prev_y, prev_dt, action)   and then we backtrack.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Initialize: \n                queue = collections.deque()\n                start state: (0,0) -> parent: None.\n\n            While queue:\n                pop state (y, dt)\n                if y==9: we break and backtrack.\n\n                Consider next actions: U, D, S -> leading to new states (y', dt+1) where:\n\n                    U: y' = y+1 (if y+1<=9)\n                    D: y' = y-1 (if y-1>=0)\n                    S: y' = y\n\n                For each new state (y', dt+1):\n\n                    If y' is in [1,8] and (dt+1) is in blocked[y'] -> skip (collision)\n\n                    Otherwise, if we haven't visited (y', dt+1) -> then we mark and push.\n\n            We also need to avoid infinite loops? But since we are going to 9 and we can go down, we might loop. We set a maximum dt? Let's say we set a limit, say 50? \n\n        We are looking for minimal H (which is the total number of turns from t1 to the turn we finish) and H = dt (since at dt=0 we are at turn14, then at dt=1 we are at turn15, ...). And we want the state (9, dt) for the smallest dt? Actually, we are doing BFS so we get the minimal dt.\n\n        But note: we might have multiple paths: we want the one with minimal dt (which is minimal H).\n\n        We break when we first reach y=9 (since BFS by dt level, the first time we hit y=9 is the minimal H).\n\n        However, we might have a path that reaches y=9 at a smaller dt? But we are doing BFS by dt (each action increases dt by 1) so the first time we reach y=9 is the minimal H.\n\n        But note: we might not go straight up? So we have to explore.\n\n        We'll set:\n\n            visited[y][dt] = True   for states we have visited.\n\n        We are going to consider states (y,dt) for y in [0,9] and dt from 0 to ... (we set a max_dt, say 50).\n\n        Let's run:\n\n            Start: (0,0)\n\n            Then from (0,0) at dt=0, we can:\n\n                U: (1,1) -> but at dt=1, freeway1: blocked[1]={2} -> 1 not in {2} -> safe? so we can go to (1,1).\n                D: (0,1) -> y=0 (safe, not freeway) -> valid.\n                S: (0,1) -> same as D? but same state? Actually, D: (0,1) and S: (0,1) -> same state.\n\n            Actually, we should avoid duplicate states. So we mark (y,dt) as visited.\n\n            We'll use a visited set: states (y,dt) that we've visited.\n\n            We start:\n\n                (0,0): visited.\n\n                Then from (0,0): \n                    U: (1,1) -> not visited -> mark and push.\n                    D: (0,1) -> not visited -> mark and push.\n                    S: (0,1) -> already in the queue? but we are going to push (0,1) only once? Actually, we push it and mark it.\n\n                But note: D and S both lead to (0,1). So we only push (0,1) once.\n\n            Then from (1,1): \n                U: (2,2) -> freeway2 at dt=2: blocked[2]={2} -> yes, so skip.\n                D: (0,2) -> freeway0? no -> valid. But we have been to (0,1) and now (0,2) -> new state.\n                S: (1,2) -> freeway1 at dt=2: blocked[1]={2} -> yes, skip.\n\n            From (0,1):\n                U: (1,2) -> freeway1 at dt=2: blocked -> skip.\n                D: (0,2) -> already being generated? \n                S: (0,2) -> same as above.\n\n            Then we have (0,2) from two paths.\n\n            From (0,2):\n                U: (1,3) -> freeway1 at dt=3: blocked[1]={2} -> 3 not in {2} -> safe -> push (1,3)\n                ... and so on.\n\n        We need to get to y=9.\n\n        Let's see if we can go through freeways 1,2,...,8 without hitting the blocked dt.\n\n        We know:\n\n            freeway1: blocked at dt=2 -> so we avoid being on freeway1 at dt=2.\n            freeway2: blocked at dt=2 -> same.\n            freeway3: blocked at dt=2 -> same.\n            freeway4: blocked at dt=2 -> same.\n            freeway5: blocked at dt=2 -> same.\n            freeway6: never blocked -> so we can be at freeway6 at any dt.\n            freeway7: never blocked.\n            freeway8: blocked at dt=0,1 -> so we avoid freeway8 at dt=0 and 1.\n\n        We start at (0,0). We must go to y=9.\n\n        We cannot go straight up: at dt=1 we would be at y=1 (freeway1) -> safe? because freeway1 is blocked at dt=2, not 1. Then at dt=2 we would be at y=2 (freeway2) -> but freeway2 is blocked at dt=2 -> collision.\n\n        So we cannot go straight up.\n\n        We must wait at y=0 for a few turns? or go down? but we are at y=0, we can't go down.\n\n        So we must wait at y=0: at turn14 (dt=0) we are at y=0. Then we can do:\n\n            Option1: S at dt=0 -> then at dt=1: still at y=0. Then at dt=1: we can do U -> then at dt=2: we are at y=1 (freeway1) -> but freeway1 blocked at dt=2 -> collision.\n\n            Option2: at dt=0: we do U -> to y=1 (dt=1) -> safe (freeway1 at dt=1: not blocked). Then at dt=1: we must avoid going to y=2 at dt=2 (because freeway2 is blocked at dt=2). So we can do:\n\n                at (1,1): we can do S -> then at dt=2: we are at y=1 -> freeway1 at dt=2: blocked -> collision.\n\n                or D -> to y=0 at dt=2 -> safe (not freeway). Then at dt=2: we are at y=0. Then we can go up again.\n\n            So:\n\n                dt0: (0,0) -> U -> (1,1)\n                dt1: (1,1) -> D -> (0,2)   [because we went down to 0 at dt=2]\n\n            Then at (0,2): we are at dt=2, and we can go:\n\n                U to (1,3): freeway1 at dt=3 -> not blocked (since blocked only at dt=2) -> safe.\n\n                Then from (1,3): we can go U to (2,4): freeway2 at dt=4 -> not blocked (only at dt=2) -> safe.\n\n                Then (2,4): U to (3,5): freeway3 at dt=5 -> not blocked -> safe.\n\n                Then (3,5): U to (4,6): freeway4 at dt=6 -> not blocked -> safe.\n\n                Then (4,6): U to (5,7): freeway5 at dt=7 -> not blocked -> safe.\n\n                Then (5,7): U to (6,8): freeway6 -> never blocked -> safe.\n\n                Then (6,8): U to (7,9): freeway7 -> safe.\n\n                Then (7,9): U to (8,10): freeway8 at dt=10: blocked set {0,1} -> not blocked -> safe.\n\n                Then (8,10): U to (9,11): goal.\n\n            So H = 11? meaning from turn14 to turn14+11-1 = turn24? \n\n            Actually, the sequence of actions: \n                t=14 (dt=0): U\n                t=15 (dt=1): D\n                t=16 (dt=2): U\n                t=17 (dt=3): U -> to y=2 at dt=3? Actually, from (0,2) at dt=2: U -> to (1,3) at dt=3.\n                Then at t=18 (dt=4): U -> to (2,4)\n                t=19: U -> (3,5)\n                t=20: U -> (4,6)\n                t=21: U -> (5,7)\n                t=22: U -> (6,8)\n                t=23: U -> (7,9)\n                t=24: U -> (8,10)\n                t=25: U -> (9,11) -> but we reach at turn t=14+11 = turn25? \n\n            How many actions? from dt=0 to dt=10: that's 11 actions? and we end at dt=11? Actually, we started at (0,0) and then after 11 actions we are at (9,11). So the last action is at turn14+10? \n\n            The sequence of actions: \n                Turn14: a0 (the first action at turn14) \n                ...\n                Turn14+10: a10 -> then at the next state (after a10) we are at (9,11) at turn14+11? \n\n            But the problem: we are at turn14 at (0,0). Then we take action at turn14: that leads to the state at turn15. Then at turn15 we take action, leads to turn16, etc.\n\n            We want the sequence of actions from turn14 to the turn when we first reach (0,9). We reach (0,9) at turn14+11? (because we take 11 actions: from turn14 to turn24, and then at turn25 we are at (0,9)? \n\n            Actually, the state after the last action (the 11th action) is at turn14+11. And at that turn, we are at y=9. So we need 11 actions.\n\n            The actions: \n                turn14: U\n                turn15: D\n                turn16: U\n                turn17: U\n                turn18: U\n                turn19: U\n                turn20: U\n                turn21: U\n                turn22: U\n                turn23: U\n                turn24: U\n\n            Then at turn25 (which is turn14+11) we are at (0,9). But note: the problem says: we take actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1, and then we are at the goal at the next state. So H is the number of actions. And we have 11 actions.\n\n            So the minimal H is 11.\n\n        But is there a faster way?\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid going down? We could wait at y=0 for 3 turns? \n\n            At (0,0): \n                S (dt=1): (0,1)\n                S (dt=2): (0,2) -> then at dt=3: we can go up.\n\n            Then:\n\n                dt0: (0,0) -> S -> (0,1)\n                dt1: (0,1) -> S -> (0,2)\n                dt2: (0,2) -> U -> (1,3) -> safe (freeway1 at dt=3: not blocked)\n                then from (1,3): we can go up to (2,4) -> safe (freeway2 at dt=4: not blocked)\n                then (2,4) to (3,5) -> safe\n                ... until (8,10) -> then (9,11)\n\n            That's 11 actions as well.\n\n        Or we could go up to y=1 at dt=1, then wait at y=1 for 1 turn? But at dt=2, y=1 is blocked. So we cannot stay at y=1 at dt=2. We must leave at dt=1: but from y=1 at dt=1, we can only go to y=0 or y=2? \n\n            If we go to y=2 at dt=2: then freeway2 at dt=2: blocked -> collision.\n\n            So we must go to y=0 at dt=2.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\n        However, we can try to go through freeways 6 and 7 earlier? but we are at y=0, we have to go through 1,2,... to get to 6,7.\n\n        Another idea: go down? but we are at y=0, we can't go down.\n\n        So the minimal H is 11.\n\n        We'll output:\n\n            Turn 14: U\n            Turn 15: D\n            Turn 16: U\n            Turn 17: U\n            Turn 18: U\n            Turn 19: U\n            Turn 20: U\n            Turn 21: U\n            Turn 22: U\n            Turn 23: U\n            Turn 24: U\n\n        But wait, after the first U at turn14, we are at y=1 at turn15? Then at turn15 we do D: then we are at y=0 at turn16? Then at turn16 we do U: then at turn17 we are at y=1? Then at turn17 we do U: then at turn18 we are at y=2? \n\n        So:\n\n            turn14: U -> at turn15: y=1\n            turn15: D -> at turn16: y=0\n            turn16: U -> at turn17: y=1\n            turn17: U -> at turn18: y=2\n            turn18: U -> at turn19: y=3\n            ... \n            turn24: U -> at turn25: y=9.\n\n        That's 11 actions: from turn14 to turn24 (inclusive) -> 11 turns. And we reach at turn25.\n\n        But the problem: the sequence of actions is for turns: t_1, t_1+1, ... t_1+H-1. So we have H=11.\n\n        However, we can do:\n\n            We could go from y=1 at dt=1 to y=0 at dt=2, then at dt=3 we go to y=1, then at dt=4 we go to y=2, etc. But that is 10 moves? \n\n            Actually, the moves:\n\n                dt0: start at (0,0) -> U -> (1,1)\n                dt1: D -> (0,2)   [because at dt1 we take D and then at dt2 we are at (0,2)]\n                dt2: U -> (1,3)\n                dt3: U -> (2,4)\n                ... \n                dt10: U -> (9,11) -> 11 actions.\n\n        Alternatively, if we do:\n\n            turn14: S\n            turn15: S\n            turn16: U -> then at turn17: y=1 (dt=3) -> safe\n            then turn17: U -> turn18: y=2 (dt=4) -> safe\n            ... then we reach y=9 at dt=10? \n\n            How?\n\n                dt0: (0,0) -> S -> (0,1)  [at turn15]\n                dt1: (0,1) -> S -> (0,2)  [at turn16]\n                dt2: (0,2) -> U -> (1,3) [at turn17: y=1]\n                dt3: (1,3) -> U -> (2,4) [at turn18: y=2]\n                dt4: (2,4) -> U -> (3,5) [turn19: y=3]\n                dt5: (3,5) -> U -> (4,6) [turn20: y=4]\n                dt6: (4,6) -> U -> (5,7) [turn21: y=5]\n                dt7: (5,7) -> U -> (6,8) [turn22: y=6]\n                dt8: (6,8) -> U -> (7,9) [turn23: y=7]\n                dt9: (7,9) -> U -> (8,10) [turn24: y=8]\n                dt10: (8,10) -> U -> (9,11) [turn25: y=9] -> then we stop? \n\n            But we have taken 11 actions? \n\n            Actually, we started at turn14 and did 11 actions: turn14 to turn24 -> that's 11 actions. Then at turn25 we are at y=9.\n\n        So both ways take 11 actions.\n\n        But is there a way to do 10? \n\n            We must be at y=9 at dt=10. \n\n            The minimal moves without waiting is 9 moves (all U). But we have to avoid the blocked freeways at dt=2. \n\n            We start at (0,0). Then:\n\n                dt0: U -> (1,1)  [turn15]\n                dt1: U -> (2,2) -> but freeway2 at dt=2: blocked -> collision.\n\n            So we must avoid being at y=2 at dt=2. How? \n\n            We could be at y=2 at dt=3: then we are safe. But then:\n\n                dt0: U -> (1,1)\n                dt1: S -> (1,2) -> freeway1 at dt=2: blocked -> collision.\n\n            Or:\n\n                dt0: U -> (1,1)\n                dt1: D -> (0,2) -> safe\n                dt2: U -> (1,3) -> safe\n                dt3: U -> (2,4) -> safe\n                ... then we need 9 moves from (0,2) to (9,?): that would take 9 moves? but we are at (0,2) at dt=2, then 9 moves: then at dt=11 we are at (9,11) -> 11 actions.\n\n            Or if we do:\n\n                dt0: U (1,1)\n                dt1: U (2,2) -> blocked -> not possible.\n\n            Therefore, minimal H=11.\n\n        We'll output the sequence:\n\n            Option1: \n                Turn14: U\n                Turn15: D\n                Turn16: U\n                Turn17: U\n                Turn18: U\n                Turn19: U\n                Turn20: U\n                Turn21: U\n                Turn22: U\n                Turn23: U\n                Turn24: U\n\n        But let me check freeway8 at the end: we go to y=8 at dt=10 (at turn24: we take U at turn24 to go to y=9 at turn25, so at turn24 we are at y=8? \n\n            At turn24: we are at y=8? and dt=10 (because we started at dt0 for turn14, then turn24 is turn14+10 -> dt=10). \n\n            freeway8: blocked at dt=0 and 1 -> not at 10 -> safe.\n\n        So the sequence is safe.\n\n        However, we can also do:\n\n            Turn14: S\n            Turn15: S\n            Turn16: U\n            Turn17: U\n            Turn18: U\n            Turn19: U\n            Turn20: U\n            Turn21: U\n            Turn22: U\n            Turn23: U\n            Turn24: U\n\n        This also takes 11 actions and avoids the blocked freeways at dt=2.\n\n        But which one to output? We need minimal H -> both are 11. We can choose either.\n\n        However, the problem says \"minimal number of turns\", and both are 11. So we can output either.\n\n        But let me check if there is a sequence with 10? We saw not.\n\n        We'll output the first sequence we found (with the U then D then U...).\n\n        However, we must be cautious: in the sequence with two S at the beginning, we avoid the need to go down. But both are valid.\n\n        We'll choose the sequence that we found in BFS: we did:\n\n            (0,0) -> U (1,1) -> D (0,2) -> then all U.\n\n        So the sequence:\n\n            Turn14: U\n            Turn15: D\n            Turn16: U\n            Turn17: U\n            Turn18: U\n            Turn19: U\n            Turn20: U\n            Turn21: U\n            Turn22: U\n            Turn23: U\n            Turn24: U\n\n        We'll output:\n\n            Turn 14: U\n            Turn 15: D\n            Turn 16: U\n            Turn 17: U\n            Turn 18: U\n            Turn 19: U\n            Turn 20: U\n            Turn 21: U\n            Turn 22: U\n            Turn 23: U\n            Turn 24: U\n\n        But note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and H=11, so t from 0 to 10.\n\n        So:\n\n            a_{14} = U\n            a_{15} = D\n            a_{16} = U\n            ...\n            a_{24} = U\n\n        We write:\n\n            Turn 14: U\n            Turn 15: D\n            Turn 16: U\n            Turn 17: U\n            Turn 18: U\n            Turn 19: U\n            Turn 20: U\n            Turn 21: U\n            Turn 22: U\n            Turn 23: U\n            Turn 24: U\n\n        We'll box that.\n\n        However, let me verify the freeway8: when we are at y=8 at turn24 (which is dt=10: because turn24 = 14+10) -> so freeway8 at dt=10: not blocked -> safe.\n\n        Also, at the other freeways:\n\n            When we are at y=1 at dt=3: freeway1: blocked only at dt=2 -> safe.\n            y=2 at dt=4: freeway2: blocked only at dt=2 -> safe.\n            ... and so on.\n\n        Therefore, the sequence is safe.\n\n        We'll output.\n\n        However, note: at turn16: we are at y=0 (from the D at turn15) and then we do U -> so at turn17 we are at y=1 (dt=3) -> safe.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Code:\n\n        We'll write the answer.\n\n        But note: we might have an alternative with the same length? but we output one.\n\n        We'll output the above.\n\n        However, we did not run BFS in code, but we reasoned. We can write a small code for this specific instance? But the problem is small.\n\n        We'll output the sequence.\n\n        Important: the problem says \"minimal number of turns\" and we have 11.\n\n        But let me check if we can do 10:\n\n            We must have 10 actions. Then we are at (9,10). \n\n            We start at (0,0). We must go up 9 times and one extra action? but we can only go up, down, or stay. To go from 0 to 9, we need at least 9 moves. But we have to avoid the freeways at the bad times.\n\n            The bad times for freeways 1-5 and 8: freeway8 is only bad at dt=0,1 -> we can avoid by being at y=8 at dt>=2? which is easy. The main problem is freeways 1-5 at dt=2.\n\n            We must not be on freeways 1-5 at dt=2.\n\n            How to avoid? \n\n                We can be at y=0,1,2,3,4,5 at dt=2? \n\n                    y=0: safe (not freeway)\n                    y=1: freeway1: blocked -> no.\n                    y=2: freeway2: blocked -> no.\n                    y=3: freeway3: blocked -> no.\n                    y=4: freeway4: blocked -> no.\n                    y=5: freeway5: blocked -> no.\n\n                So the only safe y at dt=2 is y=0, and also y=6,7,8? \n\n                    y=6: freeway6: not blocked -> safe.\n                    y=7: freeway7: not blocked -> safe.\n                    y=8: freeway8: blocked at dt=0,1 -> but at dt=2: not blocked? because blocked set is {0,1} -> so safe.\n\n            Therefore, at dt=2 we can be at y=0,6,7,8.\n\n            How to get to y=6,7,8 at dt=2? \n\n                We start at (0,0). In two moves, we can only go up at most twice: so we can be at y=0,1,2.\n\n                We cannot be at y=6 in two moves.\n\n            So the only possibility at dt=2 is y=0.\n\n            Then at dt=2 we are at y=0. Then we have 8 more moves to get to y=9. \n\n                We need 9 moves (from y=0 to y=9) -> so 8 moves is not enough? \n\n            Therefore, we must have at least 11 moves? \n\n                At dt=2: we are at y=0.\n                Then we need 9 moves to go from y=0 to y=9 -> total moves: 2 (to get to dt=2 at y=0) + 9 (to go up) = 11.\n\n            So minimal H=11.\n\n        Therefore, we output the sequence.\n\n        Final answer:\n\n            Turn 14: U\n            Turn 15: D\n            Turn 16: U\n            Turn 17: U\n            Turn 18: U\n            Turn 19: U\n            Turn 20: U\n            Turn 21: U\n            Turn 22: U\n            Turn 23: U\n            Turn 24: U\n\n        We write in the boxed format.\n\n        Note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions\", so we list from turn14 to turn24.\n\n        Output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: D\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\n}\n\n        But note: the last action at turn24 leads to (0,9) at turn25. And we stop at turn24? \n\n        The problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and H is the minimal number of turns. We have H=11, so t runs from 0 to 10 (which corresponds to turn14 to turn24).\n\n        So this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 14, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), is 11. The sequence of actions is determined as follows:\n\n- At turn 14, move up to \\(y = 1\\) (safe, as freeway 1 is not blocked at \\(dt = 1\\)).\n- At turn 15, move down to \\(y = 0\\) (safe, as \\(y = 0\\) is not a freeway).\n- At turn 16, move up to \\(y = 1\\) (safe, as freeway 1 is blocked only at \\(dt = 2\\), and \\(dt = 3\\) for this action).\n- From turns 17 to 24, move up consecutively:\n  - At turn 17, \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2 at \\(dt = 4\\), safe as blocked only at \\(dt = 2\\)).\n  - At turn 18, \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3 at \\(dt = 5\\), safe as blocked only at \\(dt = 2\\)).\n  - At turn 19, \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4 at \\(dt = 6\\), safe as blocked only at \\(dt = 2\\)).\n  - At turn 20, \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5 at \\(dt = 7\\), safe as blocked only at \\(dt = 2\\)).\n  - At turn 21, \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, always safe).\n  - At turn 22, \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7, always safe).\n  - At turn 23, \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8 at \\(dt = 10\\), safe as blocked only at \\(dt = 0, 1\\)).\n  - At turn 24, \\(y = 9\\) (goal reached, \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway).\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and reaches the goal in 11 turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: D\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\n}",

The vertical axis goes from y=0 to y=9, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, but I have to be on y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe player moves with actions: U for up (y increases by 1), D for down (y decreases by 1), or S for stay (y stays the same). y must stay within 0 to 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes over time based on the car's direction and speed.\n\nImportant point: if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not considered on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I choose an action to go to y_{T+1}. If I move, at turn T, I'm still on y_T, so I only check for collisions on y_T at that turn. When I arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, I check for collisions on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nNow, the car states are given for each freeway k (which I assume is y=k, since freeways are y=1 to 8).\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway at turn t_1=16.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h=-24, tail τ=11, direction left, speed 36.\n\nSince it's left-moving, direction left means it's moving left, so as time increases, the span shifts left. The update rule: for left-moving, span at T is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, it shifts right.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, head and tail: at t_1, span is [h, τ], and since it's moving left, h and τ decrease over time. But in this case, for freeway 1, h=-24, τ=11? That seems odd because usually head and tail should be consistent with direction.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving car: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nBut if it's moving left, and head is at h, tail at τ, with h < τ or something? I need to interpret the coordinates.\n\nThe grid is on the x-axis, I think, with x=0 being the point to avoid if a car covers it.\n\nThe player is at (0, y_t), so x=0 is the critical point.\n\nCars are on freeways, which are horizontal lines at different y levels, and they move left or right.\n\nFor a car on a freeway, its span is a horizontal interval [min, max] or something, but the notation uses head and tail.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: head h=-24, tail τ=11, direction left, speed 36.\n\nSince direction is left, and it's moving left, the head should be the front when moving left, I assume.\n\nTypically, for a left-moving car, the head is on the left if we think of direction of motion, but let's see the span.\n\nAt t_1, span is [h, τ] = [-24, 11] for freeway 1.\n\nBut -24 to 11, that's from left to right, but it's moving left, so as time increases, both h and τ decrease.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlso, collision if 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway y_T.\n\nNow for freeway 3,4,5, there are multiple cars: for example, freeway 3 has three cars: (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nLet's parse: each car is (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor the first car on freeway 3: head=-48, tail=-59, direction right, speed=12.\n\nDirection right, so moving right.\n\nFor right-moving, the span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]? Let's see the update.\n\nFrom the rule: for right-moving, \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIt says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving? In the description:\n\n\"Right-moving: [Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nFor right-moving, at t_1, span is given as [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end, I think.\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, ...), but for right-moving, head should be the front when moving right, so head is larger if moving right.\n\nBut in the span notation for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], which might imply τ is min, h is max.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], which might not be min and max.\n\nFor freeway 1: left-moving, [h, τ] = [-24, 11], so min is -24, max is 11.\n\nSince moving left, both decrease.\n\nFor freeway 3, first car: right-moving, (head=-48, tail=-59, right,12)\n\nBut head=-48, tail=-59, and for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? τ is tail, which is -59, h is head -48, so [ -59, -48 ] since -59 < -48.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (36,25,right,12), head=36, tail=25, so [τ,h] = [25,36] if tail=25, head=36.\n\nThe car state says (head, tail, direction, speed), but for the span, when direction is right, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so it's [min, max] with min=τ, max=h for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], which may not be min max; in freeway 1, [ -24, 11], min=-24, max=11.\n\nBut in general, to find if 0 in span, we need the interval.\n\nI think it's better to think of the span as an interval on x-axis.\n\nFor each car, at time t, the span is [left_end(t), right_end(t)].\n\nFor a left-moving car: at t_1, left_end(t_1) = h, right_end(t_1) = τ? From above, for freeway 1, [h,τ] = [-24,11], so left_end = -24, right_end = 11.\n\nThen at time T, left_end(T) = h - s(T - t_1), right_end(T) = τ - s(T - t_1)\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving car: at t_1, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so left_end(t_1) = τ, right_end(t_1) = h\n\nThen at T, left_end(T) = τ + s(T - t_1), right_end(T) = h + s(T - t_1)\n\nAnd collision if for the freeway y at time T, 0 is in [left_end(T), right_end(T)] for any car on that freeway.\n\nAlso, note that multiple cars on same freeway, so for each freeway, I need to check all cars at each turn when the player is on that y.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at t=16.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H, so I should go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\ny from 0 to 9, so to go from 0 to 9, minimum 9 moves up, but I might need to stay or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 9.\n\nBut since I start at y=0 and end at y=9, and must reach exactly, with actions U, D, S, the net displacement must be +9, so if I use U U times, D D times, S S times, then U - D = 9, and H = U + D + S.\n\nTo minimize H, I should minimize D and S, so ideally all U, H=9, but I need to avoid collisions on the way.\n\nSo I need to check for each freeway from y=1 to y=8, at what times it is safe to be on that y, i.e., no car covers x=0.\n\nBut since the cars move, the safety depends on time.\n\nAlso, when I am on a freeway at turn T, I need that at that exact turn, no car on that freeway covers x=0.\n\nNow, t_1 = 16 is the current turn.\n\nLet me denote t as the turn number, with t=16 being now.\n\nI need to find actions from t=16 onwards.\n\nAt t=16, player is at (0,0). Since y=0 is not a freeway, no collision possible, I assume. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, no cars.\n\nSo I start at y=0, safe. I need to end at y=9, safe.\n\nThe danger is only when I am on y=1 to 8.\n\nNow, for each freeway k, I need to find when it is safe, i.e., at time t, for freeway k, is there any car where 0 is in its span.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need to check all for each k.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the cars and their span over time.\n\nt_1 = 16.\n\nLet Δt = t - 16, so at time t, Δt = t - 16.\n\nThen for each car, span at time t.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, left-moving, h=-24, τ=11, s=36\n\nSpan at t: left_end(t) = h - s Δt = -24 - 36 Δt\n\nright_end(t) = τ - s Δt = 11 - 36 Δt\n\nCollision if 0 in [left_end(t), right_end(t)], i.e., left_end(t) ≤ 0 ≤ right_end(t)\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: same as freeway 1? \"2 | (-24, 11, left, 36)\" so identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 2 has same car: head=-24, tail=11, left, speed=36. So same as freeway 1.\n\nNow freeway 3: multiple cars.\n\nFirst car: head=-48, tail=-59, right, speed=12? Head and tail: (head, tail) = (-48, -59)\n\nFor right-moving, at t_1, left_end = τ = -59, right_end = h = -48\n\nSpan at t: left_end(t) = τ + s Δt = -59 + 12 Δt\n\nright_end(t) = h + s Δt = -48 + 12 Δt\n\nSecond car: (36, 25, right, 12) head=36, tail=25, so left_end(t_1) = τ =25, right_end(t_1) = h=36\n\nAt t: left_end(t) = 25 + 12 Δt, right_end(t) = 36 + 12 Δt\n\nThird car: (0, -11, right, 12) head=0, tail=-11, so left_end(t_1) = τ = -11, right_end(t_1) = h=0\n\nAt t: left_end(t) = -11 + 12 Δt, right_end(t) = 0 + 12 Δt = 12 Δt\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4 and 5: same as freeway 3, all have the same three cars.\n\nFreeway 4: \"(-48, -59, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)\" same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5 same.\n\nNow freeway 6: only one car: (60, 49, right, 6) head=60, tail=49, right, speed=6\n\nFor right-moving, left_end(t_1) = τ =49, right_end(t_1) = h=60\n\nAt t: left_end(t) = 49 + 6 Δt, right_end(t) = 60 + 6 Δt\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6? \"7 | (60, 49, right, 6)\" yes, identical.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (60, 49, right, 6), and (12, 1, right, 6)\n\nFirst car same as above: left_end(t) = 49 + 6 Δt, right_end(t) = 60 + 6 Δt\n\nSecond car: (12, 1, right, 6) head=12, tail=1, so left_end(t_1) = τ=1, right_end(t_1)=h=12\n\nAt t: left_end(t) = 1 + 6 Δt, right_end(t) = 12 + 6 Δt\n\nNow, for each freeway, at time t, collision if for any car on that freeway, left_end(t) ≤ 0 ≤ right_end(t)\n\nWe can find for each k, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., collision possible.\n\nSince the player moves one y per turn, I need to plan the path.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should go up as fast as possible, so ideally, I want to be at y=1 at t=17, y=2 at t=18, ..., y=9 at t=25, so H=10 turns? Let's see.\n\nAt t=16, y=0.\n\nAfter action at t=16, y_{17} = y_{16} + Δy, so if I do U at t=16, y=1 at t=17.\n\nSimilarly, if I do U at t=17, y=2 at t=18, and so on, up to y=9 at t=25 if I start from t=16.\n\nt=16: y=0\n\nt=17: y=1 (after U at t=16)\n\nt=18: y=2 (U at t=17)\n\n...\n\nt=24: y=8 (U at t=23)\n\nt=25: y=9 (U at t=24)\n\nSo from t=17 to t=25, y from 1 to 8, and t=25 y=9.\n\nH=10 actions? Actions from t=16 to t=25, that's 10 actions, but H is the number of turns, I think.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nLet's see the definition.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nt_1 + H - 1 is the turn when position is (0,9).\n\nAt turn t, position is (0, y_t), after action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, and we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, we are at y_{t_1 + H}, and we want y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9? Let's read carefully.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nFrom the task: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H - 1}\n\nFor example, if H=1, then only one action at t_1, and y_{t_1} should be 9, but at t_1, we are at (0,0), so y_{t_1} =0, not 9, so we need at least some actions.\n\nAfter action at t, y_{t+1} is new position.\n\nAt turn t_1, position is (0,0), so y_{t_1} =0.\n\nWe apply action a_{t_1}, then at turn t_1 +1, y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H -1}, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} = y_{t_1 + H -1} + Δy_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9? No.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + H -1 should be (0,9).\n\n\"y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nBut at turn t_1 + H -1, the position is after the action of previous turn.\n\nLet me clarify the timeline.\n\nAt turn t, the player is at position y_t.\n\nThen, the player chooses action a_t.\n\nThen, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nThen, at turn t+1, the player is at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn t for the position y_t.\n\nWe start at turn t_1 =16, y_{16} =0.\n\nWe apply actions a_{16}, a_{17}, ..., up to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{15 + H}, let t_1=16.\n\nAfter applying a_{16 + H -1}, at turn (16 + H -1) +1 = 16 + H, the position is set.\n\nBut we want that at some turn, y_t =9 for t = t_1 + H -1.\n\nSpecifically, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if we want to be at y=9 at turn T, then T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T =9.\n\nThe actions are from t= t_1 to t= t_1 + H -1, which determine y_{t_1 +1} to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H} is the position after the last action, but we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so at turn t_1 + H -1, position is 9, which means that the action at t_1 + H -1 could be S or U or D, but since we are at 9, if we U, we go to 10, but y=10 invalid, so we can only S or D, but D would go down, not good.\n\nTo reach y=9, the action before that should bring us to 9.\n\nSuppose at some turn T, we are at y_T =9.\n\nT must be t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe last action a_{T-1} is applied at turn T-1 to go from y_{T-1} to y_T.\n\nIf y_T =9, then a_{T-1} could be U from 8, or S from 9, or D from 10, but y=10 invalid, so only U from 8 or S from 9.\n\nSimilarly, to minimize H, we want to reach 9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince we start at 0, the earliest to reach 9 is at turn 16 + 9 = 25, if we go up every turn.\n\nAt turn 16, y=0, a_16=U, then at turn 17, y=1\n\na_17=U, turn 18, y=2\n\n...\n\na_23=U, turn 24, y=8\n\na_24=U, turn 25, y=9\n\nSo at turn 25, y=9.\n\nHere t_1=16, so T=25 = 16 + 9, so H-1 =9, thus H=10.\n\nActions from t=16 to t=25? a_{16} to a_{24} for t from 16 to 24, that's 9 actions, to reach y_25=9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{16 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet 16 + H -1 =25, so 15 + H =25, H=10.\n\nThen actions from t=16 to t=16+10-1=25? a_{t} for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so a_{16} to a_{25}? That would be H actions.\n\nLet's define:\n\nLet k = H, number of actions.\n\nActions: a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1 + k -1}\n\nAfter applying these k actions, the position at turn t_1 + k is y_{t_1 + k}\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + k -1} =9.\n\nFor example, with k actions, the turns covered from t_1 to t_1 + k -1 for actions, and positions from y_{t_1} to y_{t_1 + k}\n\nAt turn t_1, position y_{t_1}\n\nAfter a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, position y_{t_1+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t_1 + k -1}, at turn t_1 + k, position y_{t_1 + k}\n\nWe want that at turn t_1 + k -1, position y_{t_1 + k -1} =9.\n\nSo for the position to be 9 at turn T = t_1 + k -1.\n\nIn terms of turns, the position is 9 at turn T, with T = t_1 + k -1.\n\nk is the number of actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions from t= t_1 to t= t_1 + k -1.\n\nFor min k, min H.\n\nH is the number of turns for the sequence, but in the notation, H is such that actions from t=0 to H-1 relative, so number of actions is H.\n\n\"sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t from 0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nBecause after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} is set, but we want at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nWith H actions, we cover turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1 for actions, positions from y_{t_1} to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nPosition at turn t is y_t for t= t_1 to t_1 + H.\n\ny_{t_1} =0, y_{t_1 + H} is after last action.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for example, if we reach y=9 at turn T, then T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nH = T - t_1 +1.\n\nMin H means min T, the turn when we first reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at 0, min T is 25 if we go up every turn from t=16 to t=24, reaching y=9 at t=25.\n\nT=25, t_1=16, so H = T - t_1 +1 =25-16+1=10.\n\nActions at t=16 to t=25? a_t for t from 16 to 25 is 10 actions? t from 16 to 25 inclusive is 10 turns.\n\nt=16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25: that's 10 turns.\n\nBut for positions: at t=16, y=0\n\na_16: action\n\nt=17, y=1\n\n...\n\na_24: action\n\nt=25, y=9\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{16 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet 16 + H -1 =25, so 15 + H =25, H=10.\n\nYes.\n\nIf we can reach earlier, but from 0 to 9, minimum 9 ups, so at least turn 25.\n\nBut we might need to stay or go down, so T could be later.\n\nBut min possible T is 25 with all U.\n\nBut we need to check if it's possible with all U without collision.\n\nSo let's simulate going up each turn from y=0 to y=9 in 9 steps, arriving at each y from 1 to 8 at turns 17 to 24, and y=9 at 25.\n\nAt each turn when on y=1 to 8, we need no collision.\n\nSo for each freeway k, at time t when player is on k, need that at time t, no car on k covers x=0.\n\nNow, time t from 17 to 24 for y=1 to 8.\n\ny=1 at t=17, y=2 at t=18, ..., y=8 at t=24.\n\nWe need for each, at that turn, safe.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: at time t, unsafe if 0 in [left_end(t), right_end(t)] = [ -24 -36 Δt, 11 -36 Δt ] with Δt = t - 16.\n\nFor t=17, Δt=1, left_end = -24 -36*1 = -60, right_end =11-36= -25, so [-60,-25], 0 not in, since -25<0, so safe.\n\nt=18, Δt=2, left= -24-72= -96, right=11-72= -61, [-96,-61], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly for any t, since moving left, both ends decreasing, right_end =11-36Δt, for Δt>=0, right_end <=11, but 11-36Δt, for Δt=0, 11, but decreasing, for Δt=1, -25<0, so for all t>16, right_end <0, so 0 not in [left, right] since left<right<0, so always safe for freeway 1 after t=16? At t=16, but at t=16, player not on freeway 1 yet, we care when player on it.\n\nFor player on freeway 1 at t=17, as above, safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 2 same as 1, always safe for t>=17.\n\nNow freeway 3: has three cars.\n\nAt time t, with Δt = t-16.\n\nFirst car: right-moving, left_end(t) = -59 + 12 Δt, right_end(t) = -48 + 12 Δt\n\n0 in span if -59 +12Δt <= 0 <= -48 +12Δt\n\nSimilarly, second car: left_end(t) = 25 + 12 Δt, right_end(t) = 36 + 12 Δt\n\n0 in if 25+12Δt <=0<=36+12Δt, but 25+12Δt >=25>0 for Δt>=0, so left_end >=25>0, so 0 < left_end, not <=, so 0 not in [left, right] since left>0. So never unsafe for this car.\n\nThird car: left_end(t) = -11 + 12 Δt, right_end(t) = 0 + 12 Δt = 12 Δt\n\n0 in span if -11 +12Δt <= 0 <= 12 Δt\n\nNow, 0 <= 12 Δt is true for Δt >=0\n\nAnd -11 +12Δt <=0 implies 12Δt <=11, Δt <= 11/12 <1\n\nSince Δt integer, for Δt=0, -11 <=0 <=0? 0 <= 12*0=0, true, and -11<=0 true, so at Δt=0, 0 in [-11,0]\n\nBut Δt=0 is t=16.\n\nAt t=16, player not on freeway 3, we care when player on y=3.\n\nPlayer on y=3 at t=19? Let's see the timeline.\n\nPlayer on y=1 at t=17, y=2 at t=18, y=3 at t=19, y=4 at t=20, etc.\n\ny=3 at t=19, Δt = t-16 =3\n\nFor third car at t=19, Δt=3, left_end= -11 +12*3 = -11+36=25, right_end=12*3=36, [25,36], 0 not in, since 25>0.\n\nSimilarly, first car at t=19, Δt=3, left_end= -59 +36= -23, right_end= -48+36= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car always safe.\n\nSo at t=19, freeway 3 safe.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4 and 5, same cars, so at t=20 for y=4, Δt=4, etc., all should be safe similarly.\n\nBut let's check freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6: one car, right-moving, left_end(t) =49 +6 Δt, right_end(t) =60 +6 Δt\n\n0 in if 49+6Δt <=0<=60+6Δt, but 49+6Δt >=49>0, so left_end>0, 0 not in, always safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7 same.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: same as above, left_end(t)=49+6Δt, right_end=60+6Δt, always left_end>=49>0, so safe.\n\nSecond car: head=12, tail=1, right, speed=6\n\nleft_end(t) =1 +6 Δt, right_end(t) =12 +6 Δt\n\n0 in span if 1+6Δt <=0<=12+6Δt\n\nBut 1+6Δt >=1>0 for Δt>=0, so left_end>0, 0 not in, always safe.\n\nTherefore, for all freeways, at all times from t=17 onwards, it is safe to be on any y from 1 to 8? But we need to be at specific times.\n\nIn the all-up plan:\n\nt=17, y=1: freeway 1 safe\n\nt=18, y=2: freeway 2 safe\n\nt=19, y=3: freeway 3 safe (as above)\n\nt=20, y=4: freeway 4, same as freeway 3, at Δt=4, let's confirm.\n\nFor freeway 4, same as 3, at t=20, Δt=4\n\nFirst car: left_end= -59 +12*4= -59+48= -11, right_end= -48+48=0, so [-11,0], 0 is in since right_end=0, so 0 <=0 true.\n\nCollision if 0 in [left_end, right_end], which includes endpoints.\n\nSo at t=20, for freeway 4, first car: span [-11,0], so 0 is included, so collision if on freeway 4 at t=20.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt t=20, y=4, freeway 4 has a car with span [-11,0], so 0 is covered, collision.\n\nSo in the all-up path, at t=20, when player is on y=4, collision occurs.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5 at t=21, etc., but let's see.\n\nFirst, for all-up, at t=20, y=4, collision, so not possible.\n\nWe need to avoid that.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 3 at t=19, we had Δt=3, first car: left_end=-59+36=-23, right_end=-48+36=-12, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nBut at t=20, Δt=4, for freeway 4, which is same as freeway 3 but different y, but same car configuration.\n\nFreeway 4 at t=20, Δt=4.\n\nFirst car: left_end= -59 +12*4= -59+48= -11, right_end= -48+48=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 in.\n\nSecond car: left_end=25+48=73, right_end=36+48=84, [73,84], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: left_end= -11 +48=37, right_end=0+48=48, [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo only first car causes issue at t=20 for freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5, at t=21, Δt=5.\n\nFirst car: left_end= -59 +12*5= -59+60=1, right_end= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in since 1>0.\n\nAt t=21, safe for freeway 5? But player on y=5 at t=21 in all-up.\n\nBut for now, all-up fails at t=20.\n\nSo we need to adjust.\n\nPerhaps stay or go down to avoid.\n\nSince freeway 4 is unsafe at t=20, we need to not be on y=4 at t=20.\n\nIn the path, we can delay going to y=4.\n\nFor example, at t=19, instead of going to y=4, stay at y=3 or something.\n\nLet's list the unsafe times for each freeway.\n\nFirst, find for each freeway k, at which times t it is unsafe to be on k.\n\nFreeway 1: as before, for t>=17, right_end <= -25 <0, so always safe. Similarly freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 6 and 7: always safe, as left_end >=49>0.\n\nFreeway 8: both cars have left_end >=1>0, so always safe.\n\nNow freeway 3: cars as above.\n\nUnsafe if any car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst car: 0 in [ -59 +12 Δt, -48 +12 Δt ] for some Δt.\n\n-59 +12 Δt <= 0 <= -48 +12 Δt\n\nLeft: -59 +12 Δt <=0 => 12 Δt <=59 => Δt <= 59/12 ≈4.916, so Δt <=4 since integer\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 +12 Δt => 12 Δt >=48 => Δt >=4\n\nSo for Δt=4, both: -59+48= -11 <=0, and -48+48=0<=0, so 0 in.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=3: -59+36= -23 <=0? -23<=0 true, but 0 <= -48+36= -12? 0 <= -12 false, so not both true.\n\nΔt=4: -11 <=0 true, 0<=0 true.\n\nΔt=5: -59+60=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, so not.\n\nSo only for Δt=4, first car unsafe.\n\nSecond car: always safe, as left_end >=25>0.\n\nThird car: 0 in [ -11 +12 Δt, 12 Δt ]\n\n-11 +12 Δt <=0 <=12 Δt\n\nLeft: -11 +12 Δt <=0 => 12 Δt <=11 => Δt <=11/12<1, so Δt=0\n\nRight: 0 <=12 Δt always for Δt>=0.\n\nAt Δt=0, -11 <=0 <=0? 0<=0 true, but -11<=0 true, so at t=16, unsafe, but player not on.\n\nFor t>16, Δt>=1, -11+12Δt >=1>0, so left_end>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 3, unsafe only when first car has 0 in span, which is at Δt=4, t=16+4=20.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4, same cars, unsafe at t=20.\n\nFreeway 4 has same cars as freeway 3, so also unsafe at t=20.\n\nNow freeway 5, same, unsafe when?\n\nFor freeway 5, first car: 0 in [ -59 +12 Δt, -48 +12 Δt ]\n\n-59 +12 Δt <=0 <= -48 +12 Δt\n\nΔt <=4 and Δt>=4, so Δt=4, t=20.\n\nBut freeway 5 at t=20? t=20 is time.\n\nFor freeway 5, at time t, with Δt=t-16.\n\nAt Δt=4, t=20, span [ -11,0] for first car, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, at Δt=5, t=21, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 5 also unsafe only at t=20.\n\nAll freeways 3,4,5 unsafe at t=20.\n\nBut freeway 3,4,5 are different y levels.\n\nAt time t=20, if on any of y=3,4,5, unsafe.\n\nIn all-up, at t=20, we are on y=4, which is unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, we need not to be on y=3,4,5 at t=20.\n\nSince y=3,4,5 all unsafe at t=20.\n\nNow, for other times, they are safe, except at t=20.\n\nFor example, freeway 3 at t=19, Δt=3, first car span [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=21, Δt=5, [1,12], safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 4 same.\n\nFreeway 5 at t=19, Δt=3, first car [-23,-12], safe; t=21, [1,12], safe.\n\nBut at t=20, unsafe for all.\n\nNow, freeways 1,2,6,7,8 always safe for t>=17.\n\ny=1 and y=2 are freeways 1 and 2, always safe.\n\ny=6,7,8 always safe.\n\ny=3,4,5 unsafe only at t=20.\n\nIn the path to y=9, we need to be on y=3,4,5 at some point, but not at t=20.\n\nFor example, we can be on y=3 at t=19, then at t=20, instead of going to y=4, we could stay on y=3 or go down to y=2, but y=3 is unsafe at t=20, so we must leave or not be there.\n\nAt t=20, if on y=3,4, or 5, collision.\n\nSo we need to be on y=3 before or after, and similarly for others.\n\nLet's plan the path.\n\nStart at t=16, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nIdeal min time is t=25.\n\nBut at t=20, we cannot be on y=3,4,5.\n\nIn the all-up path:\n\nt=17: y=1\n\nt=18: y=2\n\nt=19: y=3\n\nt=20: y=4 (but unsafe)\n\nWe can modify.\n\nAt t=19, we are on y=3, which is safe at t=19.\n\nAt t=19, action: instead of U to go to y=4 at t=20, we can do S to stay on y=3 at t=20, but y=3 at t=20 is unsafe.\n\nOr D to go to y=2 at t=20.\n\ny=2 at t=20 is freeway 2, which is always safe, since freeway 2 has no issue.\n\nSimilarly, we can go to y=2 at t=20.\n\nThen from there, continue up.\n\nBut we lose time.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=19: at y=3, safe.\n\nAction at t=19: D, so y_{20} = y_{19} -1 = 3-1=2\n\nThen at t=20, y=2, which is safe (freeway 2 always safe)\n\nThen at t=20, action: U, so y_{21} = 2+1=3\n\nBut at t=21, y=3, now t=21, Δt=5, freeway 3 is safe, as first car span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nThen y=3 at t=21.\n\nThen we need to go to y=4,5,etc.\n\nBut we are behind.\n\nFrom t=21, y=3, then action U to y=4 at t=22.\n\nt=22, y=4.\n\nAt t=22, Δt=6, freeway 4: first car left_end= -59 +12*6= -59+72=13, right_end= -48+72=24, [13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen action U to y=5 at t=23.\n\nt=23, y=5, Δt=7, freeway 5: first car left_end= -59+12*7= -59+84=25, right_end= -48+84=36, [25,36], safe.\n\nThen U to y=6 at t=24, safe (freeway 6 always safe)\n\nU to y=7 at t=25, safe\n\nBut we need to go to y=8 and y=9.\n\nAt t=24, y=6, action U to y=7 at t=25.\n\nThen at t=25, y=7, not 9.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nCurrent: at t=23, y=5\n\nt=24, y=6\n\nt=25, y=7\n\nThen we need to go up two more: to y=8 and y=9.\n\nSo at t=25, action U to y=8 at t=26\n\nt=26, y=8, safe (freeway 8 always safe)\n\nThen action U to y=9 at t=27.\n\nSo at t=27, y=9.\n\nThus we reached at t=27.\n\nH: t=27 = t_1 + H -1 =16 + H -1, so 15+H=27, H=12.\n\nActions: from t=16 to t=26? Let's list.\n\nt=16: start y=0, action? In this path, at t=16, we need to start moving.\n\nIn above, I didn't specify from beginning.\n\nFrom t=16 to t=19, same as all-up: actions U,U,U\n\nt=16: a=U, to y=1 at t=17\n\nt=17: a=U, to y=2 at t=18\n\nt=18: a=U, to y=3 at t=19\n\nt=19: at y=3, instead of U, do D, to y=2 at t=20\n\nt=20: at y=2, do U, to y=3 at t=21\n\nt=21: at y=3, do U, to y=4 at t=22\n\nt=22: at y=4, do U, to y=5 at t=23\n\nt=23: at y=5, do U, to y=6 at t=24\n\nt=24: at y=6, do U, to y=7 at t=25\n\nt=25: at y=7, do U, to y=8 at t=26\n\nt=26: at y=8, do U, to y=9 at t=27\n\nNow, at t=27, y=9.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{16 + H -1} =27, so 16 + H -1 =27, H=12.\n\nActions from t=16 to t=26, that is 11 actions? t=16 to 26 inclusive: 16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26: 11 actions.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=16 to t=26, that's 11 actions (since 26-16+1=11).\n\nBut H is the number, and y_{16 + H -1} =27.\n\n16 + H -1 =27, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nYes, 12 actions: a_{16} to a_{27}? a_{t} for t=16 to 16+11=27? t_1 + H -1 =16 +12 -1=27.\n\na_{16} to a_{27}, but a_{27} is the last action? Let's see.\n\nActions: a_{16}, a_{17}, ..., a_{27}, that's 12 actions.\n\nAfter a_{27}, at turn 28, y is set, but we have y_{27} =9.\n\nAt turn 27, position y_{27}=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=26, we are at y=8, action a_{26}=U, so at turn 27, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut we can optimize to save turns.\n\nFor example, instead of going down to y=2 at t=20, we could go to another safe y.\n\nAt t=19, we are at y=3, safe.\n\nInstead of going down, we could stay, but at t=20, y=3 is unsafe, so cannot stay.\n\nMust move to another y.\n\ny=2 or y=4, but y=4 at t=20 unsafe.\n\ny=2 is safe.\n\ny=4 is unsafe, so only choices: D to y=2 or U to y=4 but y=4 unsafe, so only D to y=2 or S but S keeps on y=3 unsafe, so only D to y=2.\n\nThen from there.\n\nBut we lost time.\n\nTo save time, we can be on y=3 earlier or later.\n\nFor example, start by going up faster, but we can only move one per turn.\n\nAnother idea: since y=1 and y=2 are always safe, we can spend more time there if needed, but that might delay.\n\nWe can reach y=3 earlier? No, earliest t=19 if going straight.\n\nt=17 y=1, t=18 y=2, t=19 y=3.\n\nWe can delay going to y=3.\n\nFor example, at t=18, instead of going to y=3, stay at y=2 for one turn.\n\nThen at t=19, still y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=19, action U to y=3 at t=20, but at t=20, y=3 is unsafe, so collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt t=19, from y=2, do S, stay y=2 at t=20, safe.\n\nBut then we need to go up later.\n\nLet's list possible times to be on each y.\n\ny=1: can be at any t>=17, always safe.\n\ny=2: any t>=18, always safe.\n\ny=3: unsafe only at t=20, so safe at t=19,21,22,... \n\nSimilarly y=4: unsafe at t=20, safe other times.\n\ny=5: unsafe at t=20, safe other times.\n\ny=6,7,8 always safe.\n\nWe need to go from y=0 to y=9, passing through y=1 to 8 in order, but with possible stays or downs, but downs increase time.\n\nTo min time, we want to go up as much as possible, only deviating when necessary.\n\nThe only problem is at t=20 for y=3,4,5.\n\nSo we need to not be on y=3,4,5 at t=20.\n\nIn the sequence, we can be on y=3 before t=20 or after.\n\nSimilarly for y=4 and y=5.\n\nSince we have to go through them, we can adjust the timing.\n\nFor example, we can be on y=3 at t=19, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=20, instead of going to y=4, we go down to y=2, as before.\n\nBut then we come back.\n\nTo save time, we can go to y=4 after t=20.\n\nFor instance, at t=19, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=19 action: S? But S would keep y=3 at t=20, unsafe, cannot.\n\nMust change y.\n\nOptions: U to y=4 or D to y=2.\n\nU to y=4 at t=20 unsafe, so only D to y=2 at t=20.\n\nThen at t=20, y=2, safe.\n\nNow from here, we need to go up to y=3, but at t=21, y=3 is safe, as we saw.\n\nThen to y=4 at t=22, etc., as before, reaching y=9 at t=27.\n\nBut we can go directly to y=4 from y=2? No, must go through y=3.\n\nAnother idea: after y=2 at t=20, we can go up faster, but we still need to cover y=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=20, go U to y=3 at t=21, safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 at t=22, safe.\n\nU to y=5 at t=23, safe.\n\nU to y=6 at t=24, safe.\n\nU to y=7 at t=25, safe.\n\nU to y=8 at t=26, safe.\n\nU to y=9 at t=27.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt t=20, y=2, instead of going to y=3, we could go to y=1? But that would be worse, go down, then need to come back, more time.\n\nNot better.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=3 earlier, but earliest t=19.\n\nOr later, like at t=21.\n\nBut if we delay y=3, we might reach later.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=18, we are at y=2.\n\nInstead of going to y=3 at t=19, we stay at y=2 for one turn: at t=18 action S, so at t=19, y=2.\n\nThen at t=19 action U to y=3 at t=20, but t=20 y=3 unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\nAt t=19, from y=2, do U to y=3 at t=20, unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=3 at t=20.\n\nSimilarly, cannot go directly to y=4 at t=20.\n\nSo the only way is to be on y=3 before or after t=20.\n\nBut before: t=19 is possible.\n\nAfter: t=21,22,etc.\n\nBut if we do y=3 at t=19, then we must leave to a safe y at t=20, like y=2.\n\nThen y=3 again at t=21.\n\nThat costs one extra turn.\n\nIf we skip t=20 for y=3,4,5, we can do y=3 at t=19, then y=4 at t=21? But from y=3 to y=4, we need to be at y=4 at some point.\n\nAt t=19 y=3, then at t=20, we go down to y=2, then at t=21 go up to y=3, then t=22 to y=4, etc.\n\nWe have an extra y=2 at t=20 and y=3 at t=21, but we already were at y=3 at t=19, so we wasted two turns to go down and up, but net we have an extra turn to reach higher y.\n\nIn terms of progress, from t=19 y=3, after two actions (D and U), at t=21 y=3 again, same position, so lost two turns but no progress.\n\nThen from there we continue to y=4, etc., so we are two turns behind.\n\nIn all-up, at t=19 y=3, then t=20 y=4, t=21 y=5, etc.\n\nIn adjusted, at t=19 y=3, t=20 y=2, t=21 y=3, t=22 y=4, t=23 y=5, so compared to all-up, at t=21 we are at y=3 instead of y=5, so two levels behind, need two more turns to catch up, reaching y=9 at t=27 instead of t=25.\n\nYes.\n\nTo save one turn, we could go to a safe y at t=20 that is higher, but y=4 and y=5 are unsafe at t=20, y=6 is safe but we are at y=3, cannot jump.\n\nMust move step by step.\n\nAnother idea: at t=18, when at y=2, instead of going to y=3, we stay at y=2 for multiple turns to avoid the unsafe time.\n\nBut staying doesn't help progress.\n\nFor example, at t=18, y=2, action S, so at t=19, y=2.\n\nThen at t=19, action S again, at t=20, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=20, action U to y=3 at t=21.\n\nBut at t=21, y=3 safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 at t=22, etc.\n\nNow, compared to all-up: all-up at t=19 y=3, here at t=19 y=2, behind.\n\nThen t=20 y=2, t=21 y=3, t=22 y=4, ..., so at t=24 y=6, t=25 y=7, t=26 y=8, t=27 y=9.\n\nStill reach at t=27.\n\nWorse if we stay more.\n\nSo the detour costs two extra turns.\n\nBut we can reach y=9 at t=27 with H=12.\n\nBut is there a way with H=11 or 10?\n\nH=10 would be reach at t=25, but we saw all-up not possible due to t=20.\n\nH=11 reach at t=26.\n\ny_{16 + H -1} =26 for H=11.\n\nCan we reach y=9 at t=26?\n\nThat means from start, we need to progress faster, but we can only move one per turn, so from y=0 at t=16 to y=9 at t=26, that requires net +9 in 10 turns (from t=17 to t=26 position, but turns from t=16 to t=25 actions? Let's see.\n\nIf at t=26, y=9.\n\nThen actions from t=16 to t=25? 10 actions for H=10? Earlier.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{16 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet 16 + H -1 =26, then 15+H=26, H=11.\n\nSo for y=9 at t=26, H=11.\n\nActions from t=16 to t=25 (10 actions? t=16 to 25 is 10 turns, but H=11 actions? Confusion.\n\nH=11: actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{16} to a_{16+10} = a_{16} to a_{26}? t_1 + H -1 =16 +11 -1=26.\n\na_{16} to a_{26}, 11 actions.\n\nAfter a_{26}, at turn 27, y set, but we want y_{26}=9.\n\nAt turn 26, position.\n\nTo have y_{26}=9, that means we must be at y=9 at turn 26.\n\nFrom t=16 y=0, to t=26 y=9, that is 10 steps, so net +9, so we must have exactly 9 U and 1 S, or 10 U but y=9 to 10 invalid, so cannot have D or extra U, so must have 9 U and possibly S or D, but D would require more U, so min is 9 U and 0 S or D, but that would be t=16 to t=25 y=9, as before.\n\nWith 9 U, we reach in 9 actions, but with actions, if we do 9 U, from t=16 to t=24 actions U, y from 1 at t=17 to 9 at t=25.\n\nTo reach at t=26, we can do 8 U and 1 S, for example, but that would be later, not earlier.\n\nEarlier than 25 not possible.\n\nSo min possible T is 25, but not achievable due to collision.\n\nNext is 26 or 27.\n\nT=26: y=9 at t=26.\n\nHow? For example, with one stay: at some point, we stay one turn, so we progress slower.\n\nBut we need to avoid the collision.\n\nFor example, at t=19, y=3, instead of going to y=4 at t=20, we stay at y=3? But cannot, unsafe.\n\nOr go to y=2 as before.\n\nBut that takes to t=27.\n\nSuppose we reach y=3 later.\n\nFor example, at t=17, y=1, action S, stay at y=1 for t=18.\n\nAt t=18, y=1, then action U to y=2 at t=19.\n\nAt t=19, y=2, action U to y=3 at t=20, but t=20 y=3 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt t=19, from y=2, do S, stay y=2 at t=20, safe.\n\nThen at t=20, action U to y=3 at t=21, safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 at t=22, etc.\n\nNow, positions: t=16 y=0\n\na16: U, t=17 y=1\n\na17: S, t=18 y=1  (stayed)\n\na18: U, t=19 y=2\n\na19: S, t=20 y=2  (stayed)\n\na20: U, t=21 y=3\n\na21: U, t=22 y=4\n\na22: U, t=23 y=5\n\na23: U, t=24 y=6\n\na24: U, t=25 y=7\n\na25: U, t=26 y=8\n\na26: U, t=27 y=9\n\nReached at t=27, same as before.\n\nTo reach at t=26, we need y=9 at t=26.\n\nFrom above, at t=25 y=7, then a25: U to y=8 at t=26, not 9.\n\nTo have y=9 at t=26, we need to be at y=8 at t=25, for example.\n\nBut in the sequence, we are at y=7 at t=25, so not.\n\nWe can have fewer stays.\n\nFor example, from start, go up to y=2 quickly, then stay or something.\n\nt=16: U, t=17 y=1\n\nt=17: U, t=18 y=2\n\nNow at t=18, we can go directly to y=3 but at t=19 y=3 safe, then at t=19, if we go U to y=4 at t=20 unsafe.\n\nSo we must not go to y=4 at t=20.\n\nBut at t=19, we are at y=3, we can only go to y=2 or y=4, both problematic at t=20.\n\ny=4 unsafe, y=2 safe but we go down.\n\nThen we lose progress.\n\nPerhaps at t=19, we go to y=4, but since at t=20 y=4 unsafe, we need to not be on y=4 at t=20, but when we go to y=4 at t=20, we are on it at t=20, collision.\n\nUnless we can be on y=4 at a different time.\n\nBut we can't jump.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6,7,8 are always safe, we can go faster through them, but we need to get there.\n\nThe bottleneck is y=3,4,5 around t=20.\n\nSpecifically, the unsafe is only at t=20 for y=3,4,5.\n\nSo if we can be on y=3 at t=19, y=4 at t=21, y=5 at t=22, for example.\n\nBut from y=3 to y=4, we need to be at y=4 at some turn.\n\nAt t=19 y=3, then we need to go to y=4 at t=20 or later.\n\nBut at t=20, if we go to y=4, we are on y=4 at t=20, collision.\n\nIf we go at t=21, but from y=3 at t=19, to go to y=4 at t=21, we need to be at y=4 at t=21, which means at t=20, we must be at y=4 or y=3 or y=5.\n\nBut if at t=20 we are at y=4, collision; if at y=3, collision; if at y=5, collision since y=5 unsafe at t=20.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=3,4,5 at t=20.\n\nTherefore, at t=20, we must be on y=1,2,6,7,8.\n\nBut from t=19, if we are at y=3, we can only go to y=2,3,4.\n\ny=3 and y=4 unsafe at t=20, so only to y=2.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at y=2 at t=19, we can go to y=1,2,3.\n\ny=3 unsafe, so only y=1 or y=2.\n\nBut y=1 and y=2 are safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go to y=6 later, but we need to cover y=3,4,5.\n\nSo it seems inevitable to have an extra turn.\n\nPerhaps start by going up slower to delay.\n\nFor example, at t=16, action S, stay at y=0 for t=17.\n\nBut y=0 safe, no issue.\n\nThen at t=17, action U to y=1 at t=18.\n\nThen at t=18, U to y=2 at t=19.\n\nThen at t=19, U to y=3 at t=20, but unsafe.\n\nSame problem.\n\nAt t=19, from y=2, do S, stay y=2 at t=20.\n\nThen at t=20, U to y=3 at t=21.\n\nThen U to y=4 at t=22, etc.\n\nBut we started later, so at t=17 y=0, t=18 y=1, t=19 y=2, t=20 y=2, t=21 y=3, t=22 y=4, t=23 y=5, t=24 y=6, t=25 y=7, t=26 y=8, t=27 y=9.\n\nReached at t=27, same as before.\n\nWith one less action at start, but still t=27.\n\nTo reach at t=26, we need to be at y=9 at t=26.\n\nThat requires from t=16 to t=26, 10 turns, net +9, so 9 U and 1 other action, but if we do 9 U and 1 S, for example, we might be at y=9 at t=26 if the S is when at y=9, but we need to reach there.\n\nFor instance, suppose we go all up to y=8 at t=24, then at t=24 action S, stay at y=8 for t=25, then at t=25 action U to y=9 at t=26.\n\nBut at t=25, y=8, safe.\n\nThen at t=26 y=9.\n\nBut we reached at t=26.\n\nBut we need to avoid the collision at t=20.\n\nIn this case, with all-up except one stay at the end.\n\nBut in all-up, we have collision at t=20 y=4.\n\nSo we need to modify the path around t=20.\n\nSuppose we do the detour but with one less turn.\n\nFor example, at t=19 y=3, we go D to y=2 at t=20.\n\nThen at t=20 y=2, we go U to y=3 at t=21.\n\nThen from t=21 y=3, we go U to y=4 at t=22, U to y=5 at t=23, U to y=6 at t=24, U to y=7 at t=25, U to y=8 at t=26, U to y=9 at t=27.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt t=20 y=2, instead of going to y=3, we go to y=1? Worse.\n\nOr directly, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 is always safe, we can go to y=6 faster, but from y=2, we need to go through y=3,4,5.\n\nUnless we go down first, but that seems worse.\n\nI think it's not possible to reach before t=27 with the constraint.\n\nPerhaps at t=20, be on y=6.\n\nBut from t=19 y=3, we can only go to y=2,3,4.\n\nNot to y=6.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 12, reaching at t=27.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t=16: action U, to y=1 at t=17\n\nTurn t=17: action U, to y=2 at t=18\n\nTurn t=18: action U, to y=3 at t=19\n\nTurn t=19: action D, to y=2 at t=20  (to avoid being on y=3,4,5 at t=20)\n\nTurn t=20: action U, to y=3 at t=21\n\nTurn t=21: action U, to y=4 at t=22\n\nTurn t=22: action U, to y=5 at t=23\n\nTurn t=23: action U, to y=6 at t=24\n\nTurn t=24: action U, to y=7 at t=25\n\nTurn t=25: action U, to y=8 at t=26\n\nTurn t=26: action U, to y=9 at t=27\n\nNow, at t=27, y=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =16 + H -1 =27, so H=12.\n\nActions from t=16 to t=26: a_{16} to a_{26}, which is 11 actions? t=16 to 26 inclusive is 11 terms.\n\nt=16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26: 11 actions.\n\nBut H=12, so should be 12 actions.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{16 + H -1} =27.\n\nSo 16 + H -1 =27, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nThus actions from t=16 to t=16+11=27? a_{t} for t=16 to 27? But a_{27} would be to go to y_{28}, but we want y_{27}=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, the last action is at t=26 to go to y=9 at t=27.\n\nSo actions are a_{16} to a_{26}, 11 actions.\n\nThen y_{27} is set by a_{26}.\n\nFor H=12, actions a_{16} to a_{27}, but a_{27} is applied at t=27 to set y_{28}, but at t=27 we are already at y=9, so a_{27} should be S or something, but we don't need to act after reaching.\n\nThe sequence should end when we reach.\n\nIn the definition, the actions are until we reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nWith 11 actions: a_{16} to a_{26}, we have y_{27} =9, which is at turn t=27 = t_1 + 11, since t_1=16, 16+11=27.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =27, 16 + H -1=27, H-1=11, H=12, but number of actions is 11 for 11 steps? I think I have confusion in indexing.\n\nLet me set T_reach = turn when y=9, here T=27.\n\nThen T = t_1 + (T - t_1)\n\nNumber of actions needed: from t_1 to T-1, actions to go from y_{t_1} to y_{T}.\n\nSince y_{t_1} =0, y_{T}=9, number of actions is T - t_1.\n\nBecause each action advances turn.\n\nAt turn t_1, position y_{t_1}.\n\nAfter first action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, y_{t_1+1}.\n\n...\n\nAfter k-th action, at turn t_1 + k, y_{t_1 + k}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + k} =9 for some k.\n\nThen the turn is t_1 + k.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + k -1}, but after a_{t_1 + k -1}, at turn t_1 + k, y=9.\n\nThe number of actions is k.\n\nThen H is the number of actions, so H=k.\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H -1} is not directly, but from the task: \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, y_{t_1 +0} =y_{t_1} should be 9, but it is 0, not.\n\nIf we reach at turn T, with T = t_1 + m, then after m actions, y_{t_1 + m} =9.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + m} =9.\n\nBut the condition is y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo set t_1 + H -1 = t_1 + m, so H-1 = m, H = m+1.\n\nThen actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + m} , but a_{t_1 + m} is the action at turn t_1 + m, which sets y_{t_1 + m +1}, but we have y_{t_1 + m} =9, so at turn t_1 + m, we are at 9, so the action at t_1 + m should be S or not applied.\n\nI think there's inconsistency in the notation.\n\nTo resolve, in this case, we reach at turn 27, with m=11 actions from t=16 to t=26.\n\nTurn reached: 27.\n\nThen y_{27} =9.\n\nNow, t_1 + H -1 =27, t_1=16, so 16 + H -1 =27, 15+H=27, H=12.\n\nThen the sequence should have H=12 actions, from a_{16} to a_{27}.\n\nBut at turn 27, we are already at y=9, so a_{27} should be S to stay, or we can omit, but the sequence must have H actions.\n\nIn the answer format, we need to list actions until we reach.\n\nFor example, when we reach at turn T, the last action is at T-1 to go to y_T.\n\nThen for T=27, last action at t=26.\n\nActions from t=16 to t=26.\n\nNumber of actions: 11.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{16 + H -1} = y_{27} for H=12? 16 + H -1 =16+11=27 for H=12? 16+H-1=27, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nBut with 11 actions, we have positions up to y_{27}.\n\nPerhaps it's better to list the sequence as per the path.\n\nIn the path I have, actions at t=16 to t=26, 11 actions, reaching at t=27.\n\nTo match the format, with H=12, we need 12 actions, so perhaps at the end, when at y=9, we do an extra S, but that doesn't change position, and we reach at t=27, but with an extra action.\n\nBut the task is to reach (0,9), so once reached, we can stop, but the sequence must have exactly H actions to reach at that turn.\n\nI think for this case, with the sequence above, we reach at t=27 with 11 actions, so H=11, and y_{16+11-1} = y_{26} =? In the sequence, at t=26, y=8, not 9.\n\nProblem.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAfter a_{26} U, at t=27 y=9.\n\nSo at turn t=26, position y=8.\n\nAt turn t=27, position y=9.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =27.\n\nWith actions from t=16 to t=26, 11 actions, H=11, then t_1 + H -1 =16+11-1=26, y_{26} should be 9, but it is 8.\n\nNot.\n\nTo have y_{26}=9, we need to be at y=9 at turn 26.\n\nWhich means, for example, at t=25 y=8, action U at t=25, to y=9 at t=26.\n\nThen y_{26}=9.\n\nThen t_1 + H -1 =26, 16 + H -1=26, 15+H=26, H=11.\n\nActions from a_{16} to a_{25}, for example.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 at t=26.\n\nWith the detour, we are at y=8 at t=26.\n\nSo not.\n\nIn the detour path, we can adjust to reach earlier.\n\nFor example, after the detour, go faster.\n\nFrom t=21 y=3, go U to y=4 at t=22\n\nU to y=5 at t=23\n\nU to y=6 at t=24\n\nU to y=7 at t=25\n\nU to y=8 at t=26\n\nU to y=9 at t=27\n\nAt t=26 y=8.\n\nTo have y=9 at t=26, we need to be at y=9 at turn 26, so at t=25, y=8, action U at t=25 to y=9 at t=26.\n\nBut in the path, at t=23 y=5, t=24 y=6, t=25 y=7, so at t=25 y=7, not 8.\n\nSo we are one behind.\n\nIf we can be at y=5 at t=22, for example.\n\nIn the current, t=21 y=3, t=22 y=4, t=23 y=5.\n\nSo at t=23 y=5.\n\nThen t=24 y=6, t=25 y=7, t=26 y=8, t=27 y=9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=26, we need y=8 at t=25.\n\nBut at t=25 we are at y=7.\n\nSo not possible with this path.\n\nWith a different path, can we be at y=8 at t=25?\n\nFor example, if we can reach y=3 at t=19, then instead of detour, but we must avoid t=20.\n\nSuppose at t=19 y=3, we go D to y=2 at t=20.\n\nThen at t=20 y=2, we go U to y=3 at t=21.\n\nBut that is slow.\n\nFrom t=20 y=2, we go U to y=3 at t=21, same as before.\n\nNo way to skip.\n\nPerhaps start by going up to y=5 faster, but we can't.\n\nI think H=12 with T=27 is the minimal.\n\nAnd for the sequence, with H=12, actions from a16 to a27, but a27 at turn 27 when we are at y=9, we can set a27=S to stay.\n\nBut in the answer, we can list the sequence as per the path with 11 actions, but to match the format, we need to have y_{t_1 + H-1}=9.\n\nSo for T=27, H=12, actions a16 to a27, with a27 being S when at y=9.\n\nThen at turn 27, we are at y=9, and action S, but position same.\n\nBut we reached at t=27.\n\nIn the collision check, at turn 27, y=9, no issue.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nTo save, in the sequence, after reaching, we don't need action, but for the format, we can include.\n\nBut let's first write the sequence without extra.\n\nIn the initial description, the sequence should be until the action that reaches or something.\n\nBut to be safe, let's use the detour path with 11 actions, reaching at t=27, and set H=11, but y_{16+11-1}=y_{26} must be 9, but it is 8, so not.\n\nSo we must have the position at t_1 + H-1 be 9.\n\nFor example, if we reach at turn T, then set T = t_1 + H -1, so H = T - t_1 +1.\n\nFor T=27, H=27-16+1=12.\n\nThen actions from a_{16} to a_{27}, with a_{27} being S at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, a_{16} to a_{26} as above, and a_{27} = S.\n\nBut at turn 27, y=9, action S, y28=9, but we don't care.\n\nAnd for collision, at turn 27, y=9, safe.\n\nSo it works.\n\nMinimal H is 12.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach at t=26 with H=11.\n\nSuppose we are at y=8 at t=25.\n\nThen a25=U, to y=9 at t=26.\n\nSo y26=9.\n\nThen t_1 + H-1=26, 16+H-1=26, H=11.\n\nNow, can we be at y=8 at t=25?\n\nFrom start, with no delay, all-up: at t=24 y=8, but at t=20 y=4 collision.\n\nWith adjustment.\n\nSuppose we do the detour but earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=19 y=3, D to y=2 at t=20.\n\nThen at t=20 y=2, U to y=3 at t=21.\n\nU to y=4 at t=22.\n\nU to y=5 at t=23.\n\nU to y=6 at t=24.\n\nU to y=7 at t=25.\n\nThen at t=25 y=7, not 8.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=25, we need to be at y=7 at t=24.\n\nBut from above, at t=24 y=6.\n\nNot.\n\nAfter the detour, from t=21 y=3, we go U U U to y=6 at t=24, then U to y=7 at t=25, then U to y=8 at t=26, not at t=25.\n\nSo behind by one.\n\nIf we can save one turn somewhere.\n\nFor example, at the beginning, go up faster, but can't.\n\nOr at the end, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=1 and y=2 are safe, we can spend less time there, but we already do.\n\nPerhaps at t=20, instead of going to y=2, go to y=6, but impossible.\n\nI think it's not possible, so minimal H is 12.\n\nSo for the answer, we use the sequence with 12 actions.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: S  (at y=9)\n\nBut at turn 27, we are at y=9, action S to stay.\n\nIn terms of turns, from t=16 to t=27.\n\nBut at turn 27, we do action S, but position is already 9.\n\nTo avoid extra action, but for the format, it should be ok.\n\nIn the sequence, we can have only up to a26, but then y_{26} is not 9.\n\nSo we must include.\n\nPerhaps in the definition, when we reach, the last action is the one that sets y to 9.\n\nFor example, in this case, a26: U from y=8 to y=9 at t=27.\n\nBut at turn t=26, we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nSo for y_{t_1 + H-1} =9, with H=11, t_1 + H-1=16+10=26, y26=9, so we need to be at y=9 at turn 26.\n\nSo we need a path where at turn 26, y=9.\n\nWhich means at turn 25, we are at y=8, and action U at t=25 to y=9 at t=26.\n\nSo we need to be at y=8 at turn 25.\n\nNow, can we achieve that with the detour?\n\nFrom start:\n\nt=16: U, y=1 at t=17\n\nt=17: U, y=2 at t=18\n\nt=18: U, y=3 at t=19\n\nt=19: D, y=2 at t=20\n\nt=20: U, y=3 at t=21\n\nt=21: U, y=4 at t=22\n\nt=22: U, y=5 at t=23\n\nt=23: U, y=6 at t=24\n\nt=24: U, y=7 at t=25\n\nt=25: U, y=8 at t=26\n\nThen at t=25, action U to y=8 at t=26? At t=25, position y=7 (from t=24 U), action U to y=8 at t=26.\n\nSo at turn 26, y=8.\n\nThen to have y=9 at t=26, we need to be at y=9 at turn 26, so from above, at t=26 y=8, we can do action U at t=26 to y=9 at t=27.\n\nBut at turn 26, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y=9 at turn 26, we need at turn 25 y=8, action U at t=25 to y=9 at t=26.\n\nBut in the path, at t=25 we are at y=7, so not.\n\nIf we can be at y=5 at t=22, for example.\n\nBut from above, at t=21 y=3, t=22 y=4, t=23 y=5, so t=23 y=5.\n\nThen t=24 y=6, t=25 y=7, t=26 y=8.\n\nAlways y=8 at t=26.\n\nTo have y=8 at t=25, we need to be at y=7 at t=24.\n\nBut from t=23 y=5, U to y=6 at t=24, so y=6 at t=24.\n\nNot y=7.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=8 at t=25 with this path.\n\nTherefore, minimal is to reach at t=27 with H=12.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 16\\) is 12, considering the need to avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe unsafe condition occurs only at turn \\(t = 20\\) for freeways \\(y = 3\\), \\(y = 4\\), and \\(y = 5\\), due to a car on each of these freeways covering \\(x = 0\\) at that turn. To avoid collision, the player must not be on \\(y = 3\\), \\(y = 4\\), or \\(y = 5\\) at \\(t = 20\\).\n\nThe optimal sequence involves moving up directly to \\(y = 3\\) by turn 19, then moving down to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 20 to avoid the unsafe freeways, and then proceeding up to \\(y = 9\\) by turn 27. The sequence of actions is designed to minimize \\(H\\) while ensuring no collisions:\n\n- At turn 16, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 17.\n- At turn 17, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 18.\n- At turn 18, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 19.\n- At turn 19, action \\(D\\) moves to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 20 (avoids being on \\(y = 3, 4, 5\\) at \\(t = 20\\)).\n- At turn 20, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 21.\n- At turn 21, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 22.\n- At turn 22, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 23.\n- At turn 23, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 24.\n- At turn 24, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 25.\n- At turn 25, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 26.\n- At turn 26, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 27.\n- At turn 27, action \\(S\\) keeps the player at \\(y = 9\\) (no move needed, but included to complete \\(H = 12\\) actions).\n\nThe position \\((0, 9)\\) is reached at turn 27, and \\(y_{27} = 9\\) satisfies \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{16 + 12 - 1} = y_{27} = 9\\).\n\nAll freeways are safe at the times the player is on them:\n- \\(y = 1\\) at \\(t = 17\\): safe (freeway 1, no car covers \\(x = 0\\)).\n- \\(y = 2\\) at \\(t = 18\\) and \\(t = 20\\): safe (freeway 2, no car covers \\(x = 0\\)).\n- \\(y = 3\\) at \\(t = 19\\) and \\(t = 21\\): safe (freeway 3, no car covers \\(x = 0\\) at these times).\n- \\(y = 4\\) at \\(t = 22\\): safe (freeway 4, no car covers \\(x = 0\\)).\n- \\(y = 5\\) at \\(t = 23\\): safe (freeway 5, no car covers \\(x = 0\\)).\n- \\(y = 6\\) at \\(t = 24\\): safe (freeway 6, no car covers \\(x = 0\\)).\n- \\(y = 7\\) at \\(t = 25\\): safe (freeway 7, no car covers \\(x = 0\\)).\n- \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 26\\): safe (freeway 8, no car covers \\(x = 0\\)).\n- \\(y = 9\\) at \\(t = 27\\): safe (no freeway).\n\nThe sequence of actions for \\(t\\) from 16 to 27 (12 actions) is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: D \\\\\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: U \\\\\nTurn 22: U \\\\\nTurn 23: U \\\\\nTurn 24: U \\\\\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn 20 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right at their speeds, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway y at turn T and for that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that exact turn. Importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I don't collide with cars on that freeway at the turn I move.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car positions over time. The current turn is t1 = 20, and we have car states given at t1=20.\n\nFor each freeway and each car, I need to find when 0 is in their span for turns T >= 20.\n\nLet me denote the time from t1: let τ = T - t1, so τ=0 is turn 20, τ=1 is turn 21, and so on.\n\nFor a car with head h, tail τ (I'll use t for tail to avoid confusion), direction d, speed s.\n\nThe span at time T (τ from t1) is:\n\nIf left-moving: [h - s*τ, t - s*τ] since it moves left, decreasing x.\n\nIn the update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), t - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut t is tail, which might be larger or smaller? In the notation, for left-moving, it says Span(t1) = [h, τ] and then [h - s*Δt, τ - s*Δt], so since it's moving left, h and τ decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] I think? Let's see: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the table, for example, freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nBut 48 and 83, if left-moving, and h=48, t=83? That seems odd because if it's moving left, head should be the front, so for left-moving, head should be larger if x increases right, I assume.\n\nPerhaps the coordinates: x=0 is the point to avoid or where we are.\n\nIn the collision, it's when 0 is in the span, so x=0 is the critical point.\n\nFor a car, head and tail: for left-moving, head is the right end, tail left end? Let's see the span.\n\nIn freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36) — 48 and 83, but 48 < 83, and left-moving, so if it's moving left, the head should be decreasing from 48, tail from 83? But 48 < 83, so if head=48, tail=83, and moving left, then at t1, span [48,83], which is from x=48 to x=83, but since it's moving left, both decrease.\n\nBut x=0 is far left, I think, so [48,83] at t1, moving left at speed 36 per turn.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, head is the left end or right end?\n\nIn freeway 3: (48, 37, right, 12) — 48 and 37, with 37<48, and right-moving.\n\nIt says for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt]\n\nIn this case, for freeway 3, first car: (48, 37, right, 12), so is τ=37, h=48? Or what?\n\nThe notation is \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nBut for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], so for (48,37,right,12), is h=48, τ=37, so Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [37,48]? That would make sense, tail at 37, head at 48, moving right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, (48,83,left,36), h=48, τ=83, Span(t1) = [h, τ] = [48,83], so tail at 83, head at 48? But if moving left, head should be the front, so for left-moving, head is smaller x or larger?\n\nLet's clarify the coordinate system.\n\nI think x=0 is the left, and x increases to the right, like a number line.\n\nFor a car:\n\n- If moving left (d=left), the head is the front, which is at smaller x, tail at larger x? No.\n\nTypically, if moving left, the head is on the left side, tail on the right, so for left-moving, head has smaller x, tail has larger x.\n\nBut in the freeway 1: (48,83,left,36), h=48, τ=83, 48<83, so if head=48, tail=83, that means head is at x=48, tail at x=83, but since moving left, the head is at the left end? No.\n\nI think there's confusion in terminology.\n\nLet's look at the span definition.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then it moves to [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]\n\nIf [h, τ] and both decrease, that means h and τ are both decreasing, so for example, at t1, [48,83], after time, say Δt=1, [48-36,83-36] = [12,47], so the car is moving left, and the span is from left to right? [48,83] at t1, so min x=48, max x=83? But moving left, so min x decreases.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" for (48,37,right,12), if τ=37, h=48, then [τ,h] = [37,48], so min x=37, max x=48, moving right to [37+12,48+12] at Δt=1, etc.\n\nIn the collision, we care about whether 0 is in the span, meaning min <= 0 <= max for the car at that turn.\n\nFor freeway 1: car (48,83,left,36) at t1=20, τ=0 (time from t1)\n\nSpan at τ: [48 - 36τ, 83 - 36τ] for left-moving.\n\n0 is in span if 48 - 36τ <= 0 <= 83 - 36τ\n\nBut 48 - 36τ <= 0 when 48 <= 36τ, so τ >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so τ >= 2 since τ integer? τ is turn offset, integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 83 - 36τ when 36τ <= 83, τ <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so τ <= 2.\n\nSo for τ=2: min = 48-72= -24, max=83-72=11, so -24 <= 0 <=11, yes.\n\nτ=1: min=48-36=12, max=83-36=47, 12 to 47, 0 not in.\n\nτ=0: 48 to 83, no.\n\nτ=3: min=48-108= -60, max=83-108= -25, -60 to -25, 0 not <= -25? -25 <= 0? -25 <= 0 is true, but 0 <= -25 is false, so 0 not in [-60,-25] since -25 < 0.\n\nSimilarly, for τ=2: [-24,11], -24<=0<=11, yes.\n\nSo on freeway 1, car collides at τ=2, i.e., turn T=20+2=22.\n\nτ=0 is turn 20, τ=1 turn 21, τ=2 turn 22.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: same as freeway 1? \"2 | (48, 83, left, 36)\" same as freeway 1, so also collides at τ=2, turn 22.\n\nNow freeway 3: multiple cars.\n\n\"3 | (48, 37, right, 12), (12, 1, right, 12), (-24, -35, right, 12)\"\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) — head h=48, tail τ=37? Notation: \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] I think.\n\nFrom the update: right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd Span(t1) = [τ, h]\n\nSo for (48,37,right,12), if h=48, τ=37, then Span(t1) = [37,48], moving right.\n\nSpan at τ: [37 + 12τ, 48 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span: 37+12τ <= 0 <= 48+12τ\n\nBut 37+12τ <=0? 37+12τ >=37>0 for τ>=0, so never <=0, thus 0 not in span for this car, since min is at least 37.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 48+12τ always true for τ>=0, but min >0, so no.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12), h=12, τ=1? Span(t1) = [τ,h] = [1,12]\n\nSpan at τ: [1 + 12τ, 12 + 12τ]\n\nMin=1+12τ >=1>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12), h=-24, τ=-35? Span(t1) = [τ,h] = [-35,-24]\n\nSpan at τ: [-35 + 12τ, -24 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span: -35+12τ <= 0 <= -24+12τ\n\nFirst, -35+12τ <=0 when 12τ <=35, τ <= 35/12 ≈2.916, so τ<=2\n\nSecond, 0 <= -24+12τ when 24 <=12τ, τ >=2\n\nSo τ=2: min= -35+24= -11, max= -24+24=0, so [-11,0], 0 is included since <=0 and 0<=0.\n\nτ=3: min= -35+36=1, max= -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nτ=2: min=-35+24=-11, max=-24+24=0, so -11 <= 0 <= 0, yes.\n\nSo at τ=2, turn 22, 0 in span.\n\nFor freeway 4 and 5, same as freeway 3? \"4 | (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\" identical to freeway 3, so also collides at τ=2 for the third car.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5 same.\n\nNow freeway 6: \"(48,37,right,6)\" only one car.\n\n(48,37,right,6), h=48, τ=37? Span(t1) = [37,48], span at τ: [37+6τ, 48+6τ]\n\nMin=37+6τ >=37>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same as 6, \"(48,37,right,6)\", no collision possible.\n\nFreeway 8: \"(48,37,right,6), (0,-11,right,6)\"\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6), same as above, min>=37>0, no collision.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6), h=0, τ=-11? Span(t1) = [τ,h] = [-11,0]\n\nSpan at τ: [-11 + 6τ, 0 + 6τ] = [-11+6τ, 6τ]\n\n0 in span: -11+6τ <= 0 <= 6τ\n\nFirst inequality: -11+6τ <=0 when 6τ <=11, τ <= 11/6 ≈1.833, so τ<=1\n\nSecond: 0 <= 6τ always for τ>=0\n\nSo for τ=1: min= -11+6= -5, max=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nτ=0: min=-11, max=0, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nτ=0: at turn t1=20, span [-11,0], 0 is included, so at τ=0, turn 20, on freeway 8, there is a car with span [-11,0], so 0 in span, so if I am on y=8 at turn 20, I collide.\n\nBut I am at y=0 at turn 20, not on freeway, so no issue.\n\nNow for future turns:\n\nτ=0: min=-11, max=0, 0 in span.\n\nτ=1: min=-11+6= -5, max=6, 0 in.\n\nτ=2: min=-11+12=1, max=12, [1,12], min=1>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 8, collision at τ=0 and τ=1, turns 20 and 21.\n\nτ=0: turn 20, τ=1: turn 21.\n\nNow, I need to be on freeway y at turn T, and avoid when 0 in span for that y at T.\n\nAlso, I start at y=0 at turn 20.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\nNow, I need to move from y=0 to y=9, passing through y=1 to 8, but I can stay or move up/down.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0, but y bounded 0 to 9.\n\nI need min turns H, so probably I want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway and each turn T (from turn 20 onwards) whether it is occupied at x=0, i.e., if 0 is in some car's span on that row.\n\nTurn T, for freeway y, at turn T, is there a collision possible? Meaning, if I am on y at turn T, I collide if 0 in span for some car on y.\n\nSince multiple cars, but for each, we check.\n\nNow, time: let T be absolute turn, T=20,21,22,...\n\nOr τ = T - 20.\n\nFor each y and τ.\n\nFirst, y=1: cars from above, only one car, (48,83,left,36)\n\nCollision when: as before, τ=2, T=22.\n\nAt τ=2, min=48-72=-24, max=83-72=11, 0 in [-24,11].\n\nOther τ, no. τ=0,1,3,... no.\n\nSimilarly y=2: same as y=1, collision only at τ=2, T=22.\n\ny=3: freeway 3, three cars.\n\nFirst car (48,37,right,12): span [37+12τ,48+12τ], min>=37>0, no collision.\n\nSecond car (12,1,right,12): [1+12τ,12+12τ], min>=1>0, no.\n\nThird car (-24,-35,right,12): [-35+12τ, -24+12τ]\n\nCollision at τ=2: min=-35+24=-11, max=-24+24=0, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nτ=1: min=-35+12=-23, max=-24+12=-12, [-23,-12], all negative, 0 not <= -12? -12 <=0 true but 0 <= -12 false, so not in.\n\nτ=3: min=-35+36=1, max=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only τ=2.\n\nSimilarly for y=4 and y=5, same as y=3, collision at τ=2 only.\n\ny=6: freeway 6, one car (48,37,right,6), span [37+6τ,48+6τ], min>=37>0, never collision.\n\ny=7: same as y=6, no collision.\n\ny=8: freeway 8, two cars.\n\nFirst car (48,37,right,6): min>=37>0, no collision.\n\nSecond car (0,-11,right,6): span at τ: [-11+6τ, 0+6τ] = [-11+6τ, 6τ]\n\nCollision when 0 in span: as before, τ=0 and τ=1.\n\nτ=0: [-11,0], 0 in\n\nτ=1: [-11+6,6] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nτ=2: [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nτ=3: [7,18], etc.\n\nSo for y=8, collision at τ=0 (T=20) and τ=1 (T=21)\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway y and time τ, if occupied at x=0.\n\ny=1: occupied at τ=2\n\ny=2: occupied at τ=2\n\ny=3: occupied at τ=2\n\ny=4: occupied at τ=2\n\ny=5: occupied at τ=2\n\ny=6: never occupied\n\ny=7: never occupied\n\ny=8: occupied at τ=0 and τ=1\n\nτ=0 is turn 20, τ=1 turn 21, τ=2 turn 22.\n\nI start at turn 20, y=0.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nThe path: I move from y=0 to y=9.\n\nEach move, I can go up, down, or stay, but since I want min turns, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nI am on a freeway y at turn T only if I am at that y at that turn.\n\nWhen I move, for example, at turn T, I am at y_T, then I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, I am on row y_T, and I collide if y_T is between 1 and 8 and occupied at that turn.\n\nThen I move to y_{T+1} based on action.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=6 and y=7 are never occupied, I can be there anytime.\n\ny=8 is occupied at τ=0 and τ=1, i.e., turn 20 and 21.\n\nBut at turn 20, I am at y=0, not on y=8.\n\nSimilarly, turn 21, if I am at y=8, I collide, but I might not be.\n\nNow, the critical times are τ=2 for y=1 to 5.\n\ny=1 to 5 are all occupied at τ=2, turn 22.\n\nSo on turn 22, if I am on any of y=1,2,3,4,5, I collide.\n\nTherefore, at turn 22, I must not be on y=1 to 5.\n\nThat means at turn 22, I must be on y=0, or y=6,7,8, or y=9.\n\nBut y=0 and y=9 are safe, and y=6,7,8: y=6 and 7 safe always, y=8 safe except at τ=0,1 which are turns 20,21.\n\nAt turn 22, τ=2, y=8 is safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, I start at turn 20, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe min turns to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 moves up, in 9 turns? But I can stay or move down, but min should be moving up.\n\nBut with obstacles, I might need to wait or something.\n\nSince y=6 and y=7 are always safe, and y=8 is safe after turn 21, etc.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=1-5 at turn 22.\n\nAlso, for y=8, avoid at turn 20 and 21.\n\nNow, let's think about the sequence.\n\nStart: turn 20, y=0.\n\nAt turn 20, I can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go up, to y=1 at turn 21.\n\nBut at turn 21, if I am on y=1, is it occupied? y=1 occupied only at τ=2, turn 22, not turn 21.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 at turn 21: τ=1, for y=1, we have car, at τ=1: min=48-36=12, max=83-36=47, not 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all y=1-5 are safe at turn 21, except y=8 at turn 21 is occupied.\n\ny=8 occupied at turn 21.\n\nBut y=1-5 safe at turn 21.\n\nNow, if at turn 20, I go up to y=1 at turn 21.\n\nThen at turn 21, I can go up to y=2 at turn 22.\n\nBut at turn 22, y=2 is occupied, so if I am on y=2 at turn 22, I collide.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=1 at turn 21, and stay, at turn 22 y=1, collide.\n\nOr if I go down, to y=0 at turn 22, but y=0 safe.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince y=6 and y=7 are safe, I could go directly to them or something.\n\nBut I start at y=0, and I move one step at a time.\n\nAnother idea: since at turn 22, I cannot be on y=1-5, I should be on y=6 or above by turn 22.\n\nBut y=6 is high, from y=0 to y=6 in two turns? Not possible, max move up 1 per turn.\n\nFrom turn 20 to turn 22: two actions.\n\nStart y=20:0\n\nAfter action at turn 20, y_21 = y_20 + Δy, so y_21 <=1\n\nThen after action at turn 21, y_22 <= y_21 +1 <=2\n\nSo at turn 22, y <=2, since from 0, in two moves, max y=2.\n\nBut y=2 is occupied at turn 22, and y=1 also occupied, y=0 safe but low.\n\nAt turn 22, y<=2, but y=0,1,2: y=0 safe, y=1 and 2 occupied, so if I am at y=1 or 2 at turn 22, I collide.\n\nTherefore, I must be at y=0 at turn 22 to avoid collision, since y<=2 and only y=0 safe.\n\nThen at turn 22, y=0.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9, which is far.\n\nNow, after turn 22, the only dangerous time was turn 22 for y=1-5, but after that, are there other collisions?\n\ny=1-5: we saw only at τ=2, turn 22, occupied.\n\nFor example, y=1: car min and max, at τ=3: min=48-108=-60, max=83-108=-25, [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, other times no.\n\nSimilarly for y=2,3,4,5.\n\ny=6 and 7 always safe.\n\ny=8: after τ=1, turn 21, safe.\n\nSo only turn 22 is critical for y=1-5.\n\nBut at turn 22, I must be at y=0.\n\nNow, from start: turn 20, y=0.\n\nAt turn 20, I choose action.\n\nIf I go up (U), then y_21=1.\n\nThen at turn 21, if I go up, y_22=2, but at turn 22, y=2 occupied, collide.\n\nIf at turn 21, I go down, y_22=0, safe.\n\nIf at turn 21, I stay, y_22=1, collide.\n\nSo only choice at turn 21 is to go down to y=0 at turn 22.\n\nBut then I am back to y=0 at turn 22.\n\nIf at turn 20, I stay (S), then y_21=0.\n\nThen at turn 21, I can go up to y=1 at turn 22, but y=1 occupied at turn 22, collide.\n\nIf at turn 21, I stay, y_22=0, safe.\n\nIf down, but y=0 min, probably can't go down, or y stays 0, but action D from y=0: y_{t+1} = y_t -1, but y_t=0, y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) =0, I think, since y in [0,9], so from y=0, D or S both to 0.\n\nSimilarly, U to 1.\n\nSo from y=0, actions: U to 1, S to 0, D to 0.\n\nSo if at turn 20, I stay or down, y_21=0.\n\nThen at turn 21, if I go up, y_22=1, collide.\n\nIf stay or down, y_22=0.\n\nSo in all cases, to avoid collision at turn 22, I must be at y=0 at turn 22.\n\nBecause if I go up at turn 20 or turn 21, I end up at y=1 or 2 at turn 22, which collides.\n\nOnly by not moving up before turn 22 can I be at y=0 at turn 22.\n\nSo I must stay at y=0 until turn 22.\n\nAt turn 20: y=0\n\nAction: must be S or D, so y_21=0\n\nAt turn 21: action S or D, so y_22=0\n\nAt turn 22: I am at y=0, safe.\n\nNow, from turn 22 onwards, no more collisions, since only turn 22 had issues for y=1-5, and y=8 safe after turn 21.\n\nNow, at turn 22, τ=2 relative to t1, but absolute turn 22.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9, min 9 moves up.\n\nBut I can do it directly since no obstacles.\n\nBut y=6 and 7 safe, but I can go through.\n\nNow, the actions start from turn t1=20.\n\nWe need sequence from turn 20 to when we reach y=9.\n\nAt turn 22, y=0.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9.\n\nEach up move increases y by 1.\n\nSo from turn 22, y=0, after H actions, y_H = H, if all up.\n\nBut I reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nLet T be the turn when I first reach y=9.\n\nAt turn 22, y=0.\n\nThen at turn 23, y=1 if I go up, and so on.\n\nBut when I am on y=1 to 8, I need to make sure no collision, but after turn 22, all safe, as we said.\n\ny=1 at turn 23: τ=3 from t1, but for y=1, at τ=3, car min=-60, max=-25, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nSo I can just go up every turn from turn 22 onwards.\n\nAt turn 22: y=0\n\nAction at turn 22: U, so y_23=1\n\nTurn 23: U, y_24=2\n\n...\nUp to turn 31: U, y_32=10, but y max 9, so when y=9, I should stop or something, but the move: when I am at y=8, I go up to y=9.\n\nLet's see the turns.\n\nAt turn 22: y=0\n\nAfter action at turn 22: if U, y_23=1\n\nTurn 23: U, y_24=2\n\n...\n\nTurn 30: U, y_31=8\n\nTurn 31: U, y_32=9\n\nThen at y_32=9, I reach (0,9) at turn 32.\n\nSince I start from turn 22 y=0, to y=9, it takes 9 moves up, so from turn 22 to turn 31 action, y reaches 9 at turn 32.\n\nTurns: turn 22: y=0\n\nAfter action turn 22: y_23\n\n...\n\nAfter action turn 30: y_31=8? Let's index.\n\nAt turn T, after action, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nAt turn 22, position y=0.\n\nI perform action a_22, which sets y_23.\n\nIf a_22=U, y_23=1\n\nThen a_23=U, y_24=2\n\n...\na_30=U, y_31=8\n\na_31=U, y_32=9\n\nSo at turn 32, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nNumber of turns from turn 22 to turn 31 is 10 actions? Turns: actions at turn 22,23,...,31, that's 10 actions, but y from 0 to 9, 9 steps, so 9 actions.\n\nTurn 22 action: to y_23=1\n\nTurn 23 action: to y_24=2\n\n...\nTurn 30 action: to y_31=8\n\nThen to reach y_32=9, need action at turn 31: U, so y_32=9.\n\nSo actions from turn 22 to turn 31, 10 actions? But from y=0 to y=1, one action, to y=2, two, ..., to y=9, nine actions.\n\nAfter k actions up, y = initial y + k.\n\nStart y_22=0, after first up action (turn 22), y_23=1\n\nAfter second (turn 23), y_24=2\n\n...\n\nAfter ninth up action (turn 30), y_31=9? Let's see:\n\nAfter action at turn T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nSo at turn 22, before action, y=0\n\nAfter a_22=U, y_23=1\n\nAfter a_23=U, y_24=2\n\n...\nAfter a_30=U, y_31=9\n\ny_31=9 at turn 31.\n\nTurn 31: after action, y_31 is set? No.\n\nThe position: at turn T, y_T is the position.\n\nThen action a_T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nSo at turn T, y_T is current position.\n\nAfter a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nSo for example, turn 22: y_22=0\n\na_22: action, say U, then y_23 = 0 + 1 =1\n\nturn 23: y_23=1\n\na_23=U, y_24=2\n\n...\nturn 30: y_30=8\n\na_30=U, y_31=9\n\nThen at turn 31, y_31=9, we are at (0,9).\n\nSimilarly, if we start earlier.\n\nBut in our case, we have to be at y=0 at turn 22.\n\nNow back to the beginning.\n\nFrom turn 20 to turn 22, we need to be at y=0 at turn 22.\n\nAt turn 20, y=0.\n\nWe must set actions so that y_21=0 and y_22=0.\n\nAt turn 20: since y=0, if we do S or D, y_21=0\n\nSimilarly, at turn 21: y=0, S or D, y_22=0\n\nThen at turn 22: y=0\n\nThen we start going up.\n\nNow, for min turns, we should go up as soon as possible, but we have to wait until turn 22 to start moving up.\n\nAt turn 20 and 21, we must stay at y=0.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 20: action, since y=0, to stay, we can do S or D, both result in y_21=0.\n\nSimilarly turn 21: S or D, y_22=0.\n\nThen from turn 22 onwards, go up.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=0, min 9 up moves.\n\nAfter turn 22, y=0.\n\nAction turn 22: U, y_23=1\n\nAction turn 23: U, y_24=2\n\n...\n\nAction turn 30: U, y_31=9? Let's list:\n\nTurn 22: y=0, a=U, y_23=1\n\nTurn 23: y=1, a=U, y_24=2\n\nTurn 24: y=2, a=U, y_25=3\n\nTurn 25: y=3, a=U, y_26=4\n\nTurn 26: y=4, a=U, y_27=5\n\nTurn 27: y=5, a=U, y_28=6\n\nTurn 28: y=6, a=U, y_29=7\n\nTurn 29: y=7, a=U, y_30=8\n\nTurn 30: y=8, a=U, y_31=9\n\nAt turn 31, y=9, reached.\n\nSo the last action is at turn 30, reaching y=9 at turn 31.\n\nBut the goal is to reach at turn t1 + H -1 or something?\n\nThe sequence: we need actions from turn t1=20 to when we reach.\n\nIn the sequence, turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn this case, from turn 20 to turn 30, we have actions.\n\nTurn 20: action to set y_21\n\n...\n\nUp to action at turn 30 to set y_31=9.\n\nSo actions at turn 20,21,22,...,30.\n\nThat's 11 actions: t from 0 to 10, since 20 to 30 inclusive is 11 turns.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we reach at turn t1 + H.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn t1=20, position (0, y_t1) = (0,0)\n\nWe perform actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nAfter a_{t1 + H -1}, we have y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nAnd we are at turn t1 + H.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nIn this case, to have y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nStart at t1=20, y=0.\n\nAfter H actions, y = 0 + number of up moves - number of down moves.\n\nBut to min H, we should not move down, only up or stay, but staying wastes time.\n\nIn our case, from turn 20 to 21, we stay at y=0, so we have two actions that don't increase y.\n\nThen from turn 22 to 30, we increase to 9.\n\nSpecifically: actions:\n\nTurn 20: S or D, so y_21=0\n\nTurn 21: S or D, y_22=0\n\nThen turn 22: U, y_23=1\n\n...\n\nTurn 30: U, y_31=9\n\nSo actions from turn 20 to turn 30, that's 11 actions: t=0 to 10, H=11.\n\nReach at turn 31.\n\nBut is there a way to start moving earlier?\n\nEarlier I thought I must be at y=0 at turn 22, so I have to wait.\n\nBut what about going to y=6 or 7 directly? But I can't, because to reach y=6, I need to go through y=1-5, but at turn 22, they are occupied, and before that, I can be on them only at turn 21 or earlier.\n\nAt turn 21, y=1-5 are safe, as we saw.\n\nFor example, at turn 21, τ=1, y=1: min=12, max=47 for car, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly all y=1-5 safe at turn 21.\n\nOnly at turn 22 they are bad.\n\nAlso, y=8 at turn 21 is occupied, so I cannot be on y=8 at turn 21.\n\nBut at turn 20, I am at y=0.\n\nSuppose at turn 20, I go up to y=1 at turn 21.\n\nThen at turn 21, I am at y=1, which is safe since turn 21 not occupied.\n\nThen at turn 21, I need to choose action.\n\nIf I go up to y=2 at turn 22, but turn 22 y=2 occupied, collide.\n\nIf I stay at y=1 at turn 22, collide.\n\nIf I go down to y=0 at turn 22, safe.\n\nBut then I am back to y=0.\n\nIf at turn 21, I go down, but to y=0.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nSuppose at turn 20, I go up to y=1 at turn 21.\n\nThen at turn 21, instead of going up or down, I go up multiple steps? But I can only move one per turn.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=6 or 7 before turn 22.\n\nBut to be at y=6 at some turn.\n\nFor example, to be at y=6 at turn 21.\n\nFrom y=0 at turn 20, in one action, I can only go to y=1, not to y=6.\n\nImpossible.\n\nTo be at y=6 at turn 22: but at turn 22, if I am on y=6, it is safe, since y=6 no collision.\n\nBut to reach y=6 by turn 22.\n\nStart y=0 at turn 20.\n\nAfter two actions (turn 20 and 21), max y=2.\n\nSo at turn 22, y<=2, cannot be at y=6.\n\nSo impossible to be above y=2 at turn 22.\n\nTherefore, the only safe place at turn 22 is y=0.\n\nThus, we must be at y=0 at turn 22.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nBut what about y=8 at turn 21? We cannot be there, but we are not.\n\nNow, in the sequence, at turn 20 and 21, we need to stay at y=0.\n\nSo actions: turn 20: S or D, say S for simplicity.\n\nTurn 21: S or D, say S.\n\nThen turn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 30: U\n\nBut turn 30 action sets y_31=9.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions: from turn 20 to turn 30, 11 actions.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, so H=11.\n\nReach at turn t1 + H = 20 + 11 = 31.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states again.\n\nEarlier for y=8, at turn 21, occupied, but we are not there.\n\nAt turn 22, we start from y=0.\n\nNow, when we go through y=1 to 8 after turn 22, no problem.\n\nBut y=8: at turn 22, τ=2, for y=8, second car span [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nBut in the car state, for y=8, there is a car at τ=2: [1,12], no issue.\n\nNow, but we have freeway 8 with two cars, but only the second one was problematic at τ=0,1.\n\nNow, in the action sequence, we have to specify the actions.\n\nBut at turn 20 and 21, we can choose S or D, since both keep y=0.\n\nProbably S is fine.\n\nNow, the minimal H: is 11 the minimum?\n\nSuppose I try to be at y=0 at turn 22, but start moving later? No, I have to wait.\n\nPerhaps I can move to other rows, but no.\n\nAnother thought: what about y=9? But I need to reach it.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster by not waiting, but I think I must wait.\n\nLet's list all possible collision points to see if there are others.\n\nFor example, on y=3,4,5, we have cars, but only at turn 22.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 only at turn 20 and 21.\n\nBut at turn 20 and 21, I am at y=0, so fine.\n\nSo I think H=11 is the minimum.\n\nBut let's count the turns.\n\nStart turn 20, y=0.\n\nAfter 0 actions, y=0.\n\nAfter 1 action (turn 20), y=0 if S or D.\n\nAfter 2 actions (turn 20 and 21), y=0.\n\nAfter 3 actions (turn 20,21,22), y=1 (if a_22=U)\n\n...\n\nAfter 11 actions (turn 20 to 30), y=9 at turn 31.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 20 to 30 inclusive, that's 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nTo reach in fewer turns, I need to start moving earlier, but I can't because of turn 22.\n\nUnless I go to y=6-8 earlier, but I can't reach by turn 22.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=6 at turn 23 or something, but at turn 22 I have to be at y=0.\n\nThen from there, min 9 up moves.\n\nSo I think 11 is min.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nWe need to output the sequence.\n\nFirst, at turn 20: action, since y=0, we do S (stay), so y_21=0\n\nTurn 21: S, y_22=0\n\nTurn 22: U, y_23=1\n\nTurn 23: U, y_24=2\n\nTurn 24: U, y_25=3\n\nTurn 25: U, y_26=4\n\nTurn 26: U, y_27=5\n\nTurn 27: U, y_28=6\n\nTurn 28: U, y_29=7\n\nTurn 29: U, y_30=8\n\nTurn 30: U, y_31=9\n\nReach at turn 31.\n\nActions from turn 20 to 30: 11 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify for each turn.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 8, at turn 21, it is occupied, but we are not on it.\n\nAlso, is there any other constraint?\n\nIn freeway 8, there is a car at τ=0 and τ=1, but we avoid.\n\nIn the beginning, at turn 20, we are at y=0, not on freeway.\n\nAnother thing: when we move, for example, when we go from y to y+1, at the turn we move, we are on the old y, not the new one.\n\nBut in this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can save a turn by going down or something, but no.\n\nSuppose at turn 20, I go down, but from y=0, down keeps y=0, same as stay.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's confirm with the car on freeway 8.\n\nAt turn 21, y=8 is occupied, but we are at y=0, so fine.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 29, we are at y=8? Turn 29: after action turn 28, y_29=7? Let's list positions:\n\nTurn 20: y=0\n\na_20 = S, y_21=0\n\na_21 = S, y_22=0\n\na_22 = U, y_23=1\n\na_23 = U, y_24=2\n\na_24 = U, y_25=3\n\na_25 = U, y_26=4\n\na_26 = U, y_27=5\n\na_27 = U, y_28=6\n\na_28 = U, y_29=7\n\na_29 = U, y_30=8\n\na_30 = U, y_31=9\n\nAt turn 30, after a_30, y_31=9, so at turn 31, y=9.\n\nThe actions are from turn 20 to turn 30.\n\nFor turn 29, we are at y=7, go to y=8 at turn 30.\n\nThen at turn 30, at y=8, we go to y=9.\n\nNow, at turn 30, when we are on y=8, is it safe? Turn 30, τ=10 from t1=20? Absolute turn.\n\nt1=20, turn T=30, τ=10.\n\nFor y=8, cars: first car min=37+6*10=37+60=97, max=48+60=108, safe.\n\nSecond car: span [-11+6τ, 6τ] at τ=10: [-11+60, 60] = [49,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nNo issue.\n\nThus, the sequence should be fine.\n\nH=11 actions, from t=0 to 10.\n\nIn the output, we need to write the actions for each turn.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 20: S\nTurn 21: S\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\n}\n\nBut this is up to turn 30, and at turn 31 we reach.\n\nThe sequence has 11 actions, from turn 20 to 30.\n\nIn the box, it should be Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nt_1=20.\n\nSo Turn 20: S\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nTurn 22: U\n\n...\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nAnd we reach at turn 31.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nSuppose I go to y=1 at turn 21, then at turn 21, I go down to y=0 at turn 22, same as before.\n\nOr, at turn 21, I could go to another row, but I have to be on y=0 at turn 22.\n\nNo shortcut.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=6 at turn 23 or something, but I need to get there.\n\nFrom turn 22 y=0, to y=6, I need 6 up moves, taking to turn 27 or so, but then to y=9, more, same total.\n\nFor example, if I could be at y=3 at turn 22, but I can't, because occupied.\n\nSo I think 11 is min.\n\nBut let's see the car on freeway 3,4,5: there is a car at (-24,-35,right,12), which at τ=2, span [-11,0], so 0 included.\n\nBut only at that turn.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nAnother point: in freeway 8, at τ=0, turn 20, span [-11,0], 0 included, but we not on it.\n\nNow, I think it's correct.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I used S at turn 20 and 21, but I could use D, same effect.\n\nBut S is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nThe sequence of actions: a_{20} to a_{30}.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write it.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from (0, 0) at turn 20 with the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, the following sequence of actions is determined based on the car states and collision conditions.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Collision at Turn 22 (τ=2)**: Freeways y=1 to y=5 are occupied at x=0 at turn 22 (absolute turn 22, τ=2 relative to turn 20). Therefore, the player must not be on y=1 to y=5 at turn 22 to avoid collision.\n- **Collision at Turns 20 and 21 (τ=0 and τ=1)**: Freeway y=8 is occupied at x=0 at turns 20 and 21, so the player must avoid being on y=8 at these turns.\n- **Safe Positions**:\n  - At turn 22, the only safe positions are y=0 (start/end zone) or y=6,7,8 (since y=6 and y=7 are always safe, and y=8 is safe after turn 21).\n  - However, from turn 20 (y=0), the maximum y achievable by turn 22 is y=2 (after two up moves), so y=6,7,8 are unreachable by turn 22. Thus, the only safe position at turn 22 is y=0.\n- **Actions to Stay at y=0 for Turns 20 and 21**: To ensure y=0 at turn 22, the player must choose actions that keep y=0 at turns 20 and 21. This means choosing \"S\" (stay) or \"D\" (down) at these turns, both resulting in y=0 for the next turn.\n- **No Collisions After Turn 22**: After turn 22, there are no collisions on any freeway (y=1 to y=8), so the player can move directly upward to y=9 without delay.\n\n### Minimal Path:\n- **Turns 20 and 21**: Stay at y=0 to avoid collisions and ensure y=0 at turn 22.\n- **Turns 22 to 30**: Move up (\"U\") each turn to reach y=9 at turn 31. Specifically:\n  - Start at turn 22 (y=0), move up to y=1 at turn 23.\n  - Continue moving up one y-level per turn until y=9 is reached at turn 31 after the action at turn 30.\n\nThis path requires 11 actions (turns 20 to 30) to reach (0,9) at turn 31. It is minimal because:\n- Any upward move before turn 22 would place the player on y=1 or y=2 at turn 22, causing a collision.\n- Staying at y=0 for turns 20 and 21 is necessary, adding 2 turns of no progress.\n- Reaching y=9 from y=0 requires at least 9 up moves, which cannot be compressed due to the turn-based movement.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns 20 to 30 is as follows. Each action determines the player's position at the next turn.\n\n| Turn | Action | New y-position | Notes |\n|------|--------|----------------|-------|\n| 20   | S      | 0 (at turn 21) | Stay at y=0 to avoid moving to a dangerous y. \"D\" would also work but \"S\" is chosen for simplicity. |\n| 21   | S      | 0 (at turn 22) | Stay at y=0 to be safe at turn 22. |\n| 22   | U      | 1 (at turn 23) | Start moving up; y=1 is safe at turn 23. |\n| 23   | U      | 2 (at turn 24) | y=2 safe. |\n| 24   | U      | 3 (at turn 25) | y=3 safe. |\n| 25   | U      | 4 (at turn 26) | y=4 safe. |\n| 26   | U      | 5 (at turn 27) | y=5 safe. |\n| 27   | U      | 6 (at turn 28) | y=6 always safe. |\n| 28   | U      | 7 (at turn 29) | y=7 always safe. |\n| 29   | U      | 8 (at turn 30) | y=8 safe after turn 21; at turn 30, τ=10, car spans do not contain 0. |\n| 30   | U      | 9 (at turn 31) | Reach y=9 at turn 31. |\n\nAfter the action at turn 30, the player reaches (0,9) at turn 31. The total number of turns (H) is 11, from turn 20 to turn 30 (inclusive).\n\n### Verification Against Car States:\n- **Turns 20-21 (y=0)**: Player is not on any freeway, so no collision.\n- **Turn 22 (y=0)**: Safe, as y=0 is not a freeway.\n- **Turns 23-30 (y=1 to y=8)**: After turn 22, no freeway has a car span containing 0 at these turns:\n  - y=1-5: Only dangerous at turn 22 (τ=2), but turns 23-30 have τ=3 to 10, where car min/max do not include 0 (e.g., y=1 at τ=3: span [-60,-25], 0 not in range).\n  - y=6-7: Always safe, as min car position >0.\n  - y=8: Safe after turn 21 (τ=1); at τ=2 and later, car spans (e.g., [1,12] at τ=2) do not contain 0.\n\nThus, the sequence avoids all collisions and reaches the goal in minimal turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 20: S\nTurn 21: S\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The current turn is t_1 = 22. The player moves up, down, or stays, changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move on their freeways, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway y at turn T and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that exact turn. If I move to a different y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I don't collide with cars there until I'm actually on it.\n\nLet me list out the car states for each freeway at turn t_1 = 22.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head 48, tail 83, direction left, speed 36. Since it's left-moving, the span at t_1 is [h, τ] = [48, 83]. But head and tail: for left-moving, it says span is [h, τ], and h and τ are positions. Head 48, tail 83, but if it's moving left, and head is at 48, tail at 83, that might imply it's oriented such that as it moves left, head decreases. Let me read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ], and at time T, span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: span(t_1) = [τ, h], I think? No, it says: for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nI need to interpret head and tail based on direction.\n\nFor left-moving cars: head is the front when moving left, so at start, head position, tail position, and as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head is front when moving right, both increase.\n\nIn the table:\n\nFor freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nIf direction left, and head 48, tail 83, but 48 < 83, so if it's moving left, the head should be at higher x if x increases right, but positions are on a line, I assume x from left to right.\n\nThe freeway is a horizontal line, I think, with x-coordinates. The player is at (0,y), so x=0 is the point we care about for collision.\n\nFor a car, span includes positions from min to max, I think.\n\nFor left-moving car: span(t) = [head(t), tail(t)] but head and tail change.\n\nAt time t_1, for left-moving, span is [h, τ], meaning from h to τ, and since it's moving left, h decreases over time.\n\nIn this case, freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36). So span at t_1 is [48, 83]. But 48 to 83, if moving left, the car is from 48 to 83, with head at 48? That seems odd because usually head is the front.\n\nPerhaps head is the position of the front, tail of the back.\n\nFor left-moving, front is at smaller x if x increases right.\n\nAssume x-axis with 0 at left, increasing right.\n\nSo for a left-moving car, front (head) is at smaller x, back (tail) at larger x.\n\nFor example, if head at 10, tail at 20, it occupies x=10 to 20, and moving left, so head decreases, tail decreases.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, head at larger x, tail at smaller x.\n\nIn the input, for freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36). Head 48, tail 83. Since left-moving, head should be left, tail right, so head=48, tail=83, but 48 < 83, so head at 48, tail at 83, so the car is from 48 to 83, with front at 48 (left), back at 83 (right), moving left, so positions decreasing.\n\nAt t_1=22, span [48,83].\n\nAt time T, span [48 - 36(T-22), 83 - 36(T-22)]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h], but in the input, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for right-moving, head is larger, tail smaller.\n\nFor example, freeway 3: (48,37, right,12) — head 48, tail 37, since right-moving, head should be right, so if head=48, tail=37, 48>37, so head at 48, tail at 37, so car from 37 to 48, with front at 48, moving right, so positions increasing.\n\nSpan at t_1: for right-moving, it says [τ, h], so [37,48]? τ is tail, h is head, so [tail, head] for right-moving.\n\nIn the rule: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\" for right-moving.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, the player is on freeway y, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at T.\n\nPlayer is on y at turn T if after action at T-1, y_T is set, and we check collision at T.\n\nLet's clarify the turn sequence.\n\nAt turn t, player chooses action a_t, then y_{t+1} is updated based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we have position (0, y_{t+1}), and we check for collision on freeway y_{t+1} at that turn.\n\nThe collision condition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAlso, note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSince you move at turn T, y_{T+1} is set at the end of turn T, so at turn T, you are on y_T, and at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nSo for collision at turn T, you are on y_T, and we check cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, back to the cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway at t_1=22.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=48, tail=83, dir=left, speed=36)\n\nSpan at T: [48 - 36(T-22), 83 - 36(T-22)]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (48,83,left,36) so same span.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, span at t_1: for each car, [τ, h]\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, so [37,48]\n\nSecond car: head=12, tail=1, so [1,12]\n\nThird car: head=-24? head=-24, tail=-35? dir=right, so tail=-35, head=-24, so span [ -35, -24 ]\n\nAt T: for right-moving, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\ns=12 for all.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFreeway 5: same as 3 and 4.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (48,37,right,6) so head=48, tail=37, dir=right, speed=6, span at t_1: [37,48]\n\nAt T: [37 + 6(T-22), 48 + 6(T-22)]\n\nFreeway 7: same as 6: (48,37,right,6) span [37,48] at t_1\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (48,37,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car same: [37,48] at t_1\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, dir=right, so span [τ, h] = [-11, 0] at t_1\n\nAt T: for second car, [ -11 + 6(T-22), 0 + 6(T-22) ] = [ -11 + 6(T-22), 6(T-22) ]\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,0) at turn t_1=22. y=0 is not a freeway, I think, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0, no cars, safe. Similarly y=9 is goal, no cars.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9).\n\nNow, actions: U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0.\n\nMinimal turns H, meaning minimal number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and need to go to y=9, the minimal possible without cars would be 9 actions of U, but with cars, we might need to wait or detour.\n\nBut we can only move vertically, so we have to go through each y from 1 to 8, and avoid being there when a car covers x=0.\n\nSince the player moves one y per turn when moving up, but can stay or move down, but moving down might not help since we need to go up.\n\nProbably, moving down is not useful, but sometimes to avoid collision, we might stay or move to avoid being on a bad y at bad time.\n\nBut since we can only change y by 0 or ±1 each turn, and y bounds, we have to pass through each integer y from 0 to 9.\n\nNow, the key is to find when it is safe to be on each freeway y=1 to 8 at some turn T.\n\nFor each freeway, at each turn T, we can compute if x=0 is covered by any car on that freeway.\n\nIf covered, then if player is on that y at that T, collision.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nPlayer starts at turn t_1=22, y=0.\n\nWe need to choose actions for turns 22, 23, 24, etc., until we reach y=9.\n\nLet me denote the turns starting from t=22,23,24,...\n\nLet τ = T - 22, so time offset.\n\nFor each freeway, find for which τ, the freeway is unsafe at turn T=22+τ.\n\nThat is, at turn T, if player on y, and for that y, at T, 0 in some car span.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: y=1\n\nCar: left-moving, span at T: [48 - 36τ, 83 - 36τ] where τ = T-22\n\n0 in span if 48 - 36τ ≤ 0 ≤ 83 - 36τ\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst, 48 - 36τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 48 ≤ 36τ ⇒ τ ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so τ ≥ 2 since τ integer? τ is integer, turns.\n\nT is integer, τ = T-22 integer.\n\n48 - 36τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 36τ ≥ 48 ⇒ τ ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 = 1.333, so since τ integer, τ ≥ 2\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ 83 - 36τ ⇒ 36τ ≤ 83 ⇒ τ ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so τ ≤ 2\n\nτ ≤ 2 and τ ≥ 2, so only τ=2.\n\nτ ≥ 2 from first, τ ≤ 2 from second, so τ=2.\n\nCheck: τ=2, span [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11], 0 is between -24 and 11? -24 ≤ 0 ≤ 11, yes.\n\nτ=1: span [48-36,83-36] = [12,47], 0 not in [12,47]\n\nτ=3: span [48-108,83-108] = [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at τ=2, T=24, freeway 1 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same car, same thing, unsafe only at T=24.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3\n\nThree cars.\n\nFirst car: right-moving, span at T: [37 + 12τ, 48 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span if 37+12τ ≤ 0 ≤ 48+12τ\n\nBut 37+12τ ≤ 0? 12τ ≤ -37, impossible since τ≥0, so never true. This car never covers x=0.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12) span at t_1 [1,12], at T: [1 + 12τ, 12 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span: 1+12τ ≤ 0 ≤ 12+12τ\n\n1+12τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 12τ ≤ -1, impossible, so never.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12) head=-24, tail=-35, dir right, span [τ, h] = [-35, -24] at t_1\n\nAt T: [-35 + 12τ, -24 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span: -35 + 12τ ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 12τ\n\nFirst, -35 + 12τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 12τ ≤ 35 ⇒ τ ≤ 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so τ ≤ 2\n\nSecond, 0 ≤ -24 + 12τ ⇒ 12τ ≥ 24 ⇒ τ ≥ 2\n\nSo τ ≥ 2 and τ ≤ 2, so τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, span [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0], 0 ≤ 0 ≤ -11? -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nSo at T=24, unsafe.\n\nNow, are there other times? τ=2 only.\n\nBut let's confirm:\n\nτ=1: [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12], 0 not in\n\nτ=2: [-11,0], 0 in\n\nτ=3: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo only at T=24.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3, so also unsafe only at T=24.\n\nFreeway 5: same, unsafe at T=24.\n\nNow freeway 6: y=6\n\nOne car: (48,37,right,6) span at t_1 [37,48], at T: [37 + 6τ, 48 + 6τ]\n\n0 in span: 37+6τ ≤ 0 ≤ 48+6τ\n\n37+6τ ≤ 0? impossible, so never unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: same, no car covers x=0.\n\nFreeway 8: y=8\n\nTwo cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6) same as above, never covers x=0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6) head=0, tail=-11, dir right, span at t_1 [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [-11 + 6τ, 0 + 6τ] = [-11 + 6τ, 6τ]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 6τ ≤ 0 ≤ 6τ\n\nFirst, -11 + 6τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 6τ ≤ 11 ⇒ τ ≤ 11/6 ≈ 1.833, so τ ≤ 1\n\nSecond, 0 ≤ 6τ ⇒ τ ≥ 0\n\nBut τ ≤ 1 and τ ≥ 0, so τ=0 or τ=1.\n\nτ=0: T=22, span [-11, 0], 0 in\n\nτ=1: T=23, span [-11+6, 6] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nτ=2: T=24, span [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo for freeway 8, unsafe at T=22 and T=23.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when it is unsafe (x=0 covered):\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=24\n\ny=2: same as y=1, unsafe at T=24\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=24\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=24\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=24\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=22 and T=23, safe at T=24 and later? At T=24, y=8 is safe, since car span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nBut T=22 and 23 unsafe.\n\nNow, player starts at turn 22, y=0.\n\nAt turn 22, position is (0,0), which is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe dangerous turn is T=24, where y=1,2,3,4,5 are all unsafe.\n\ny=1 to 5 unsafe at T=24.\n\ny=6 and 7 always safe.\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=22 and T=23, but safe at T=24.\n\nAt T=24, y=8 is safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe minimal path: from y=0, we need to go to y=9.\n\nWe can move up, down, or stay.\n\nBut moving down from y=0 is impossible since y=0 min, so at y=0, action D would keep y=0, I think, but y must be in [0,9], so if at y=0 and action D, y stays 0? The update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on action, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if at y=0 and action D, Δy = -1, but y_{t+1} = 0 + (-1) = -1, but must be >=0, so probably clamped to 0, or invalid? The rule says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so I think it must be within bounds, so if it would be out of bounds, it stays at bound or something? Not specified.\n\nLook back: \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\", and Δy defined, so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, y_{t+1} = -1 not in [0,9], so probably it is set to 0. Similarly if y_t=9 and U, set to 9.\n\nI think it's safe to assume that y is clamped to [0,9], so action D at y=0 does nothing, similarly U at y=9 does nothing.\n\nIn this case, starting at y=0, we can only go up or stay.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=9.\n\nNow, the critical point is to avoid being on y=1 to 5 at turn 24.\n\nBecause at T=24, those freeways have cars at x=0.\n\nAlso, for y=8, unsafe at T=22 and T=23, but safe at T=24.\n\nTurn T=22: player is at (0,0), not on any freeway.\n\nAt turn 22, after action, we move to y_{23}.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nLet me denote the turn when we are at position.\n\nAt turn 22: we are at y=0 (initial position).\n\nThen we choose action a_{22}, which determines y_{23}.\n\nAt turn 23, we are at (0, y_{23}), and if y_{23} between 1 and 8, we check collision with cars on that freeway at turn 23.\n\nSimilarly for subsequent turns.\n\nWe need to reach a turn where y=9.\n\nNow, minimal H: since we start at y=0, need to go to y=9, at least 9 moves up, but we can stay, so H >=9, but might be more if we stay or move down, but moving down not helpful, so probably H=9 if no obstacles, but with obstacles, we might need to delay.\n\nIn this case, the only obstacle is at T=24 for y=1-5, and T=22,23 for y=8.\n\nBut T=22 and 23 are early.\n\nNow, let's see possible paths.\n\nFirst, at turn 22, we are at y=0.\n\nWe choose a_{22}: can be S or U.\n\nIf S, y_{23} = 0\n\nIf U, y_{23} =1\n\nBut at turn 23, if we are on y=1, we need to check if safe.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, unsafe only at T=24, not at T=23.\n\nAt T=23, freeway 1: from earlier, span [48-36(1),83-36(1)] = [12,47], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other y.\n\nBut y=8 unsafe at T=23.\n\nSince we start at y=0, let's consider actions.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe fastest way: go up as fast as possible.\n\nStart turn 22: y=0\n\nAfter a_{22}, y_{23} = ?\n\nIf we go up immediately:\n\na_{22} = U, then y_{23} =1\n\nAt turn 23: position y=1, freeway 1, at T=23, safe as above.\n\nThen we can go up again: a_{23} = U, y_{24} =2\n\nBut at turn 24: y=2, freeway 2, which is unsafe at T=24! Collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf at turn 23, we stay: a_{23}=S, y_{24}=1\n\nThen at turn 24, y=1, freeway 1, unsafe at T=24, collision.\n\nIf we go down from y=1, but y=1, a_{23}=D, y_{24}=0, then at turn 24, y=0, not freeway, safe, but we are at y=0, not progress.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo, if we are on y=1 at turn 23, we cannot be on y=1,2,3,4,5 at turn 24.\n\nAt turn 23, y=1, we must move to y=0 or y=2, but y=2 at turn 24 is unsafe.\n\nOptions at turn 23, if y=1:\n\n- a_{23}=U: y_{24}=2, then at turn 24, y=2, unsafe, collision.\n\n- a_{23}=D: y_{24}=0, safe, but back to start.\n\n- a_{23}=S: y_{24}=1, unsafe at turn 24.\n\nAll bad? But we need to avoid being on y=1-5 at turn 24.\n\nSo at turn 24, we must not be on y=1,2,3,4,5.\n\nThat means at turn 24, we must be on y=0,6,7,8, or 9.\n\ny=9 is goal, but we start from low.\n\nAt turn 23, after action, y_{24} is set.\n\ny_{24} must be 0,6,7,8, or 9 to avoid collision at turn 24.\n\nBut at turn 23, we are at some y, and choose action.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 eventually.\n\nNow, back to turn 22.\n\nAt turn 22, we choose a_{22}, then y_{23} set.\n\nThen at turn 23, we choose a_{23}, then y_{24} set.\n\nWe need y_{24} to be safe, i.e., not 1-5.\n\ny_{24} can be 0,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=9 might not be reachable yet.\n\nNow, from turn 22:\n\nCase 1: a_{22} = S, then y_{23} = 0\n\nThen at turn 23, we are at y=0.\n\nThen we choose a_{23}: if U, y_{24}=1, but y=1 at turn 24 unsafe.\n\nIf S, y_{24}=0, safe but no progress.\n\nIf D, y_{24}=0 same.\n\nSo to have safe y_{24}, from y=0 at turn 23, we can only go to y_{24}=0 by S or D, but y=0 is safe at turn 24, since not freeway.\n\nThen we are stuck at y=0.\n\nNot good.\n\nCase 2: a_{22} = U, then y_{23} =1\n\nAt turn 23, we are at y=1.\n\nThen as before, from y=1 at turn 23, we cannot go to y=1,2 at turn 24 without collision.\n\ny_{24} options:\n\nIf a_{23}=U, y_{24}=2, unsafe\n\na_{23}=S, y_{24}=1, unsafe\n\na_{23}=D, y_{24}=0, safe\n\nBut y_{24}=0, then we need to go up later.\n\nBut we lost time.\n\nNow, y_{24}=0 is safe, but we are at y=0 at turn 24.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9 from there.\n\nBut at turn 24, we can start moving up.\n\nBut turn 24 is the critical turn, after that, no problem except for y=8 at earlier times, but T=24 is past the unsafe for y=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe only at T=22 and 23, safe after.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways safe except at T=24 for y=1-5.\n\nAfter T=24, all freeways are safe, since no car covers x=0 at other times.\n\nFor example, y=1 only unsafe at T=24, etc.\n\ny=6,7 always safe.\n\nSo after turn 24, it is clear to go up.\n\nBut at turn 24, we need to be at a safe y, which is 0,6,7,8,9.\n\nNow, from start, how to get to one of these by turn 24.\n\nTurn 22: y=0\n\nAfter a_{22}, y_{23}\n\nThen after a_{23}, y_{24}\n\nWe need y_{24} in {0,6,7,8,9}\n\nBut y=9 might be too far.\n\ny=8: but at turn 24, y=8 is safe, as we saw.\n\nBut can we reach y=8 by turn 24?\n\nTurn 22: y=0\n\nAfter one action, y_{23} <=1 (since from 0, U to 1 or S to 0)\n\nThen from y_{23}, after one action, y_{24} <= y_{23} +1\n\nIf y_{23}=0, y_{24}<=1\n\nIf y_{23}=1, y_{24}<=2\n\nSo y_{24} <=2 at most, cannot reach y=6,7,8,9 by turn 24.\n\ny_{24} max is 2, since from y=0, in two moves, can be at y=2: a_{22}=U, y_{23}=1; a_{23}=U, y_{24}=2.\n\nBut y=2 is unsafe at turn 24.\n\ny_{24} cannot be 6,7,8,9 because we start from 0, and only two actions to increase y.\n\nIn two turns from turn 22, we can at best be at y=2 at turn 24.\n\nBut y=2 is unsafe.\n\ny_{24} could be 0 or 1, but both unsafe or no progress.\n\ny=0 at turn 24 is safe, but we are low.\n\nThen we need to go up after.\n\nBut minimal turns.\n\nAnother option: at turn 24, we can be at y=0, which is safe.\n\nThen from there, go up directly.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, from turn 24, y=0, we can go up each turn to y=9 in 9 turns.\n\nBut let's see the turns.\n\nFirst, how to be at y=0 at turn 24.\n\nFrom turn 22: y=0\n\nIf we do nothing: a_{22}=S, y_{23}=0\n\nThen a_{23}=S, y_{24}=0, safe at turn 24.\n\nThen from turn 24, y=0, we can start going up.\n\na_{24}=U, y_{25}=1\n\nAt turn 25: y=1, freeway 1, now at T=25, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 1 at T=25, τ=3, span [48-108,83-108] = [-60,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all freeways safe after T=24.\n\ny=1 at T=25 safe.\n\nThen we can go up each turn: a_{25}=U, y_{26}=2\n\nTurn 26: y=2, safe, since only unsafe at T=24.\n\nSimilarly, up to y=9.\n\nNow, sequence:\n\nTurn 22: at y=0, choose a_{22}\n\nTo be at y=0 at turn 24, we need y_{24}=0.\n\nSo at turn 22, a_{22}=S, then y_{23}=0\n\nTurn 23: at y=0, choose a_{23}=S, then y_{24}=0\n\nTurn 24: at y=0, choose a_{24}=U, y_{25}=1\n\nTurn 25: at y=1, a_{25}=U, y_{26}=2\n\nTurn 26: at y=2, a_{26}=U, y_{27}=3\n\nTurn 27: at y=3, a_{27}=U, y_{28}=4\n\nTurn 28: at y=4, a_{28}=U, y_{29}=5\n\nTurn 29: at y=5, a_{29}=U, y_{30}=6\n\nTurn 30: at y=6, a_{30}=U, y_{31}=7\n\nTurn 31: at y=7, a_{31}=U, y_{32}=8\n\nTurn 32: at y=8, a_{32}=U, y_{33}=9\n\nNow at turn 33, y=9, reached.\n\nBut is y=8 safe at turn 32?\n\nTurn 32: T=32, freeway 8.\n\nAt T=32, τ=32-22=10\n\nFreeway 8 cars:\n\nFirst car: [37 + 6*10, 48 + 6*10] = [37+60,48+60]=[97,108], not at 0.\n\nSecond car: [-11 + 6*10, 6*10] = [-11+60,60] = [49,60], not at 0.\n\nSafe.\n\nThen a_{32}=U to y=9.\n\nBut H is the number of actions? From turn 22 to turn 33, we have actions from a_{22} to a_{32}, 11 actions? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from t=22 to t=32, that's 11 turns: t=22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32.\n\nBut the position after action at t=32 is y_{33}=9.\n\nSo we reach at turn 33, after 11 actions.\n\nBut minimal? H is the number of turns from start to reach, I think.\n\nThe task: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1} such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nStart turn t_1=22.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H - 1, y=9.\n\nThe actions are applied at turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter these H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H, with y_{t_1 + H} =9? No.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + H - 1 is (0,9).\n\nThe actions: for t from 0 to H-1, a_{t_1 + t}, so actions at turns t_1 to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter action at turn t_1 + H - 1, we have y_{t_1 + H}? No.\n\nThe position is at the beginning of turn, I think.\n\nAt turn t, position is fixed, then we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, position is (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nWe reach (0,9) when at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nIn the condition, y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9 means at turn t_1 + H - 1, we are at (0,9).\n\nAnd we applied actions from t_1 to t_1 + H - 2? Let's see.\n\nSuppose H=1, then actions for t=0, a_{t_1 +0} = a_{t_1}, and y_{t_1 +1 -1} = y_{t_1} =9? But we start at y=0, not 9.\n\nIn general, after actions, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe actions are applied at turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and after these actions, at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nBut the action at turn t_1 + H -1 determines y_{t_1 + H}, not y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nI think I misread.\n\nThe position y_t is at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nThen we choose action a_t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nWe reach when at some turn, y_t =9 for t >= t_1.\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1, meaning a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nFor example, if H=1, we need y_{t_1 +1 -1} = y_{t_1} =9, but we start at y=0, so impossible unless already there.\n\nSimilarly, minimal H to reach from current position.\n\nStart at turn t_1, y_{t_1} =0.\n\nAfter k actions, we can be at y_{t_1 + k} up to min(9, k) if always up.\n\ny_{t_1 + k} <= k.\n\nTo reach y=9, need at least 9 actions, so H >=9.\n\nWith actions from t=0 to H-1, applied at t_1 to t_1+H-1, and y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSince at turn t_1, we are at y_{t_1}, after action a_{t_1}, we go to y_{t_1 +1}, and so on, after a_{t_1 + H -2}, we go to y_{t_1 + H -1}, and after a_{t_1 + H -1}, we go to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, meaning at turn t_1 + H -1, before action, we are at y=9.\n\nThen the action at that turn might keep it or change, but since we are already at 9, we can stay or whatever, but we have reached.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify actions until we reach.\n\nIn this case, for y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, we have reached at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe actions are from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, but a_{t_1 + H -1} is chosen when we are at y=9, so it might be S or U (but U would go to 10, clamped to 9?).\n\nBut since we are already at 9, the action doesn't matter, but we need to include it in the sequence? H actions.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that we apply H actions to reach at turn t_1 + H -1 with y=9.\n\nBack to the problem.\n\nStart at turn 22, y=0.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn T >=22.\n\nMinimal T-22.\n\nBut with constraints.\n\nIn the earlier plan, with waiting, we reach at turn 33, which is T=33, so H such that t_1 + H -1 =33, so 22 + H -1 =33, H=12.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =33, 22 + H -1 =33, so 21 + H =33, H=12.\n\nActions from t=22 to t=22+11=33? Let's list turns.\n\nTurn 22: position y=0, choose a_{22}\n\nTurn 23: position y_{23}, choose a_{23}, etc.\n\nWe want position at turn T to be y_T=9.\n\nWith the sequence: if we do nothing at turn 22 and 23, then at turn 24 y=0, then go up each turn, we reach y=9 at turn 33.\n\nTurn 24: y=0\n\nTurn 25: y=1 (after a_{24}=U)\n\n...\n\nTurn 33: y=9 (after a_{32}=U from y=8)\n\nSo at turn 33, y=9.\n\nActions from turn 22 to 32: a_{22} to a_{32}, 11 actions.\n\nH=11, then t_1 + H -1 =22+11-1=32, but at turn 32, we are at y=8 if we go up, not 9.\n\nConfusion.\n\nDefine: let the turn index.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} set.\n\nWe start at t=22, y_22=0.\n\nWe apply a_22, then y_23.\n\nApply a_23, y_24.\n\n...\n\nApply a_{T-1}, then y_T for some T.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T.\n\nThe number of actions is from t=22 to t=T-1, so K = T - 22 actions.\n\nThen H = K, number of turns, meaning number of actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"minimal number of turns H\", and sequence of actions.\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9)\".\n\nWith K actions, we go from y_22 to y_{22+K}.\n\nSince each action can increase y by at most 1, y_{22+K} <= K.\n\nTo have y_{22+K} =9, need K >=9.\n\nMinimal K is 9 if possible.\n\nBut with the car at T=24, we might not be able to be at high y at that time.\n\nIn the waiting plan, we used 11 actions to reach at turn 33.\n\nBut perhaps we can do better.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 and y=7 are always safe, we can go directly to them if possible, but from start, we can't reach by turn 24.\n\nAt turn 24, we must be at y=0,6,7,8,9 but 6,7,8,9 unreachable from y=0 in 2 steps.\n\nOnly y=0,1,2 possible at turn 24.\n\ny=0 safe, y=1 and 2 unsafe.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at turn 24 to avoid collision.\n\nThen from there, go up, taking 9 actions to reach y=9 at turn 33.\n\nBut turn 33 is t=33, from t=22, 11 turns later, so 11 actions.\n\nCan we reach faster?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=6 or 7 at turn 24, but impossible, since from y=0, max y at turn 24 is 2.\n\nUnless we start earlier, but we start at t=22 y=0.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 22, we are at y=0, not on freeway.\n\nAt turn 23, we can be at y=0 or 1.\n\ny=8 is unsafe at turn 23, but if we are not on it, ok.\n\nBut at turn 24, we need to be safe.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=8 at turn 24, but impossible.\n\ny=8 at turn 24 is safe, but we can't reach it from y=0 in two moves.\n\nThe only safe position at turn 24 is y=0, since y=6,7,8,9 not reachable.\n\ny=0 is reachable and safe.\n\nThen we have to start from there.\n\nBut is there a way to be at higher y before turn 24?\n\nFor example, at turn 23, if we are at y=1, which is safe at turn 23, but then from there, we cannot stay or go up to y=2 at turn 24, both unsafe.\n\nWe have to go down to y=0 at turn 24.\n\nSame as before.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=8 after turn 24.\n\nBut we are delayed.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 and 7 are always safe, we can go there quickly after turn 24.\n\nBut to reach y=6, from y=0, need 6 steps.\n\nIf we start at turn 24 y=0, then after 6 steps, at turn 30 y=6? Let's see.\n\nFrom turn 24 y=0:\n\na_{24}=U, turn 25 y=1\n\na_{25}=U, turn 26 y=2\n\na_{26}=U, turn 27 y=3\n\na_{27}=U, turn 28 y=4\n\na_{28}=U, turn 29 y=5\n\na_{29}=U, turn 30 y=6\n\nThen from y=6, we can go up to y=9 in 3 more steps: a_{30}=U, turn 31 y=7; a_{31}=U, turn 32 y=8; a_{32}=U, turn 33 y=9.\n\nSame as before, reach at turn 33.\n\nBut at y=5, turn 29, is it safe? y=5 freeway, at T=29, which is after T=24, so safe, since only unsafe at T=24.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nBut we reached at turn 33.\n\nCan we save time?\n\nFor example, if at some point we go faster, but we are constrained at turn 24.\n\nSince we must be at y=0 at turn 24, we lose two turns, so minimal to reach y=9 is 11 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose we go up at turn 22 to y=1 at turn 23.\n\nThen at turn 23, instead of going down, can we go to another y? But only y=0,1,2 possible.\n\ny=2 at turn 24 is unsafe.\n\nUnless we can be at y=6 at turn 24, impossible.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=8 at turn 24 if we start from higher, but we start low.\n\nAnother thought: the player can move down, but from y=0, can't go down.\n\nAt turn 23, if we are at y=1, we could stay, but at turn 24 unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 before turn 24, but from y=0, to y=9, minimal 9 actions, but in 2 actions from turn 22, we can be at y=2 at turn 24, not 9.\n\nTurn 24 is only 2 steps from start, so y<=2.\n\nCannot reach high before.\n\nSo indeed, the only way is to be at y=0 at turn 24, then go up.\n\nMinimal H=11 actions.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nActions from turn 22 to turn 32.\n\nTo have y=0 at turn 24.\n\nAt turn 22: a_{22} = S (stay, y_{23}=0)\n\nAt turn 23: a_{23} = S (stay, y_{24}=0)\n\nThen from turn 24: a_{24} = U (y_{25}=1)\n\na_{25} = U (y_{26}=2)\n\na_{26} = U (y_{27}=3)\n\na_{27} = U (y_{28}=4)\n\na_{28} = U (y_{29}=5)\n\na_{29} = U (y_{30}=6)\n\na_{30} = U (y_{31}=7)\n\na_{31} = U (y_{32}=8)\n\na_{32} = U (y_{33}=9)\n\nWe reach at turn 33 with y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=22 to t=32 inclusive, that's 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =22 +11 -1=32, but at turn 32, y=8, not 9.\n\nProblem.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{32} should be 9, but it's 8.\n\nIn this, after a_{32}, y_{33}=9, so at turn 33, y=9.\n\nWe need to reach at some turn T with y_T=9.\n\nWith actions from t=22 to t=32, we have y_{33}=9.\n\nThe last action is at t=32, so H=11 actions, applied at t=22 to 32, and y_{33}=9, so the position at turn t_1 + H =22+11=33 is 9.\n\nBut the condition is y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nI think I have a confusion with the indexing.\n\nLet me read the task.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThat means at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at (0,9).\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nFor example, if H=1, y_{t_1 +0} = y_{t_1} =9.\n\nBut we start at 0, not 9.\n\nTo reach from 0 to 9, H must be at least 10, I think.\n\nSuppose H actions applied.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t_1, y=0.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn t_1+1, y could be 0 or 1.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k, y between 0 and min(9,k).\n\nWe want at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, we are at turn t_1 + (H-1), with y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThen the action at turn t_1 + H -1 is applied, but it doesn't change the position at that turn.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, including the one at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nBut since we are already at 9, that action could be S or U (U might go to 10, but clamped to 9).\n\nIn terms of reaching, we are at 9 before the action.\n\nIn this case, for us, to have y_T=9 at turn T.\n\nFrom start turn 22, after m actions, we are at turn 22 + m.\n\ny_{22 + m} = position after m actions.\n\nWe want y_{22 + m} =9 for some m.\n\nMinimal m.\n\nWith the waiting, we have y_{24} =0 (after 2 actions: a22 S, a23 S)\n\nThen after 2 more actions, y_{26} =2? Let's see:\n\nAfter k actions from turn 22, we are at turn 22+k with y_{22+k}.\n\nAfter 0 actions: turn 22, y=0\n\nAfter 1 action: turn 23, y= y23\n\nAfter 2 actions: turn 24, y=y24\n\netc.\n\nWe want y_{22 + m} =9.\n\nWith the sequence:\n\nAfter 2 actions: at turn 24, y=0 (if a22=S, a23=S)\n\nThen after 3 actions: a24=U, turn 25 y=1\n\nAfter 4: turn 26 y=2\n\nAfter 5: turn 27 y=3\n\nAfter 6: turn 28 y=4\n\nAfter 7: turn 29 y=5\n\nAfter 8: turn 30 y=6\n\nAfter 9: turn 31 y=7\n\nAfter 10: turn 32 y=8\n\nAfter 11: a32=U, turn 33 y=9\n\nSo after 11 actions, at turn 33, y=9.\n\nThus m=11, turn t_1 + m =22+11=33.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for turn 33, y=9, so t_1 + H -1 =33, 22 + H -1 =33, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nH=12, then y_{22+12-1} = y_{33} =9.\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1=11, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+11}, that is a22 to a33.\n\nBut at turn 33, we are already at y=9, so a33 can be S or U.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify a22 to a33.\n\nBut a33 is after reaching.\n\nTo reach at turn 33 with y=9, we applied actions a22 to a32, 11 actions, but a33 is not necessary for reaching, but since we need to specify H actions until we reach.\n\nWith H=12, we have 12 actions, from a22 to a33, but at turn 33, after a33, y34 is set, but we are already at y33=9.\n\nSo for the action at t=33, we can choose S, for example.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence.\n\nBut it's a bit waste, but necessary for the format.\n\nSince we reach at turn 33, and we need to include the action at that turn.\n\nIn minimal H, with H=12, we reach at turn 33.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=9 at turn 31 or something.\n\nBut from turn 22, to reach y=9, at least 9 actions, so earliest at turn 31.\n\nTurn 22: y=0\n\nIf we go up every turn:\n\na22=U, turn23 y=1\n\na23=U, turn24 y=2 but unsafe, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf we go up at turn22 to y=1 at turn23.\n\nThen at turn23, to avoid being at y=1-5 at turn24, we must go to y=0, so a23=D, then turn24 y=0.\n\nThen from turn24 y=0, go up: a24=U, turn25 y=1\n\na25=U, turn26 y=2\n\n...\n\nup to a30=U, turn31 y=7\n\na31=U, turn32 y=8\n\na32=U, turn33 y=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nAfter a23=D, we are at turn24 y=0, same as waiting.\n\nNo gain.\n\nPerhaps at turn23, from y=1, we can go to y=2, but unsafe at turn24.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think 11 actions to reach, but with H=12 for the index.\n\nH=12, actions from a22 to a33.\n\nBut a33 is after reaching.\n\nTo minimize H, but H=12 is the minimal for the index.\n\nAnother way: since at turn24, we must be at y=0, then from there to y=9, need 9 actions, so total actions from start: 2 to reach y=0 at turn24, plus 9 to y=9, but the 2 actions are to stay, so total 11 actions for moving, but with the reach turn.\n\nLet's accept H=12.\n\nBut in the sequence, for the first two actions, we stay.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to list the actions.\n\nPerhaps we can start going up later.\n\nBut no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 and 7 are safe, we can go to them directly after turn24, but from y=0, we need to go through lower ys, but after turn24, all safe, so no issue.\n\nBut we still need the same number of steps.\n\nSo I think minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on y=8 at turn22 and 23.\n\nIn our plan, we never on y=8 at those times, so ok.\n\nNow, for the sequence.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 22: S  (y23=0)\n\nTurn 23: S  (y24=0)\n\nTurn 24: U  (y25=1)\n\nTurn 25: U  (y26=2)\n\nTurn 26: U  (y27=3)\n\nTurn 27: U  (y28=4)\n\nTurn 28: U  (y29=5)\n\nTurn 29: U  (y30=6)\n\nTurn 30: U  (y31=7)\n\nTurn 31: U  (y32=8)\n\nTurn 32: U  (y33=9)\n\nNow, at turn 33, y=9, reached.\n\nWe have actions from turn 22 to 32, 11 actions.\n\nBut for H, we need y_{t1+H-1} =9, so at turn t1+H-1=33, y=9.\n\nThus t1+H-1=33, 22+H-1=33, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to 11, a_{t1} to a_{t1+11}, so a22 to a33.\n\nWe need to add action at turn 33.\n\nAt turn 33, y=9, we can choose a33=S, for example.\n\nThen y34=9, but we don't care.\n\nSo sequence with H=12.\n\nTo save, but H=12 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn 32.\n\nIs it possible?\n\nTo have y=9 at turn 32.\n\nThen from turn 22, after 10 actions? After k actions, at turn 22+k.\n\ny_{22+k} =9.\n\nMinimal k=9 if always up, but at turn 24, y=2, which must be avoided.\n\nIf we go up as much as possible except at turn 24.\n\nBut at turn 24, we need to be at y=0 or safe.\n\nSuppose:\n\nTurn 22: U, y23=1\n\nTurn 23: D, y24=0  (to avoid)\n\nThen turn 24: U, y25=1\n\nturn 25: U, y26=2\n\n...\n\nturn 31: U, y32=8\n\nNot 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 32, we need y32=9.\n\nFrom start, after 10 actions, at turn 32.\n\ny32=9.\n\nBut at turn 24, which is after 2 actions, y24 must be 0.\n\nThen from turn 24 y=0, to turn 32, 8 actions later, y32 <= 8, since from 0, max increase 8, to y=8.\n\nCannot reach y=9 at turn 32.\n\nSimilarly, earliest to reach y=9 is turn 33, with y33=9.\n\nThus H=12 for the index.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to output the actions from turn 22 to turn 33.\n\nBut at turn 33, since we are at y=9, we can choose S.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have actions to turn 32, which gets us to y=9 at turn 33.\n\nThen for turn 33, we add S.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: S\n\nBut at turn 32, action U from y=8 to y=9.\n\nThen at turn 33, we are at y=9, action S keeps it.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 12 actions.\n\nBut H=12.\n\nNow, to write in the format.\n\nBut in the actions, for the first two, we stay, then go up.\n\nBut is there a way to have fewer actions?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=1 at turn 24, but unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps on other freeways.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 23, if we are at y=1, which is safe, but then we cannot be there at turn 24.\n\nBut if we move to y=2 at turn 24, unsafe.\n\nUnless we can jump to y=6, but no.\n\nSo I think it's optimal.\n\nThus minimal H=12.\n\nNow, for the sequence, as above.\n\nBut in the output, we need to list for each turn.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=22.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: S\n\nBut at turn 33, action S, but we reached at turn 33, so it might not be necessary, but for the sequence of H actions, we include it.\n\nTo make H smaller, but we can't.\n\nPerhaps we don't need the last action if we are already there, but the format requires H actions until reach.\n\nIn the sequence, when we reach, the action can be specified.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach with H=11.\n\nWith H=11, y_{t1+H-1} = y_{22+11-1} = y_{32} =9.\n\nBut can we have y32=9?\n\nFrom turn 22, after 10 actions? y_{32} at turn 32.\n\nTo have y32=9.\n\nBut at turn 24, y24 must be 0 for safety.\n\nThen from y24=0, after 8 actions to turn 32, y32 <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nIf y24=1, but unsafe, collision.\n\nSo impossible to have y32=9.\n\nThus minimal H=12.\n\nNow, for the car on y=8 at turn 22 and 23, in our sequence, we are never on y=8 at those times, so ok.\n\nIn the sequence, we go to y=8 at turn 32, which is safe.\n\nNow, write the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 22\\) is 12. This requires 12 actions, applied from turn 22 to turn 33, resulting in the player being at \\(y = 9\\) at turn 33.\n\nThe sequence of actions avoids collisions by ensuring the player is not on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 24 (when these freeways are unsafe due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\)) and not on freeway \\(y = 8\\) at turns 22 and 23 (when it is unsafe). Specifically:\n- At turns 22 and 23, the player stays at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, as \\(y = 0\\) is not a freeway).\n- At turn 24, the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe), then begins moving upward.\n- From turn 25 onward, all freeways are safe, as the only unsafe turn for \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\) is turn 24, and for \\(y = 8\\) only turns 22 and 23 are unsafe.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n- Turn 22: Stay (S), resulting in \\(y_{23} = 0\\).\n- Turn 23: Stay (S), resulting in \\(y_{24} = 0\\).\n- Turn 24: Up (U), resulting in \\(y_{25} = 1\\).\n- Turn 25: Up (U), resulting in \\(y_{26} = 2\\).\n- Turn 26: Up (U), resulting in \\(y_{27} = 3\\).\n- Turn 27: Up (U), resulting in \\(y_{28} = 4\\).\n- Turn 28: Up (U), resulting in \\(y_{29} = 5\\).\n- Turn 29: Up (U), resulting in \\(y_{30} = 6\\).\n- Turn 30: Up (U), resulting in \\(y_{31} = 7\\).\n- Turn 31: Up (U), resulting in \\(y_{32} = 8\\).\n- Turn 32: Up (U), resulting in \\(y_{33} = 9\\).\n- Turn 33: Stay (S), as the player has reached \\(y = 9\\) (no further movement needed, but an action is required for the sequence).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 33 with no collisions, and \\(H = 12\\) is minimal because:\n- Being on \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 24 causes a collision, so the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 24.\n- From \\(y = 0\\) at turn 24, at least 9 actions are needed to reach \\(y = 9\\) (since each \"Up\" increases \\(y\\) by 1), reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 33.\n- The two initial \"Stay\" actions (turns 22 and 23) are necessary to remain at \\(y = 0\\) until turn 24, making \\(H = 12\\) the minimum.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 30: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: \\text{ S} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 24, and the player is at (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\n The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position y is in [0,9]. We start at y=0 and want to get to y=9.\n\n Important: Collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that exact turn.\n\n Note: When moving from y to y' at turn T, we are only present on the starting freeway y at turn T. The next freeway y' will be occupied at turn T+1.\n\n Therefore, at each turn T, the player is on freeway y_T. We must check for collision on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\n The cars are defined for freeways 1 to 8. We do not need to worry about freeway 0 (which is the starting point, but note the player is at (0,0) at turn 24) or freeway 9 (the goal) because there are no cars on freeway 0 and 9? Actually, the problem states cars on freeways y=1,...,8. So freeway 0 and 9 are safe.\n\n However, note that the goal is at (0,9). So we must end at turn H-1 at position 9. And at that turn, we are on freeway 9, which has no cars. So no collision.\n\n How the cars move:\n\n For a car on a freeway (we don't care which freeway for now, but we will check the freeway we are on at turn T) at turn T (relative to t1=24):\n\n   T_relative = T - 24\n\n For a car that is left-moving (d='left'): \n      At turn T, the span is [h - s*(T-24), tau - s*(T-24)]\n\n For a car that is right-moving (d='right'):\n      At turn T, the span is [tau + s*(T-24), h + s*(T-24)]\n\n Collision if the player is on freeway k at turn T and there exists a car on freeway k such that 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\n But note: the car list for freeway k is given. We must check every car on the freeway we are on.\n\n We are to find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves the player from y0=0 at turn 24 to y=9 at some turn (24+H-1) with minimal H.\n\n We note that the minimal H without any obstacles would be 9 (because we start at 0 and need to go to 9, each U increases by 1). But we have obstacles.\n\n However, we can also move down? But we start at 0 and the goal is at 9, so moving down would be counterproductive? But sometimes we might need to avoid a car by waiting (staying) or even moving down to avoid a collision and then go up.\n\n But note: we are at y=0 at turn 24. We cannot go below 0. So at y=0, if we try to move down, we stay at 0? Actually, the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, and y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. So if we are at 0 and choose D, we stay at 0? Or it says y_{t+1} is clamped? The problem states: \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\". So if we are at 0 and choose D, we get y_{t+1} = 0 - 1 = -1 -> but then clamped to 0? The problem does not specify clamping, but it says \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\". So I think it's bounded: we cannot go below 0. Therefore, at y=0, D and S both result in y=0. Similarly, at y=9, U and S result in y=9.\n\n Therefore, at y=0: \n   U -> 1\n   D -> 0\n   S -> 0\n\n We are to minimize H, so we want to get to 9 as quickly as possible. We should prefer U as much as possible, but we must avoid collisions.\n\n We are going to simulate the movement from turn 24 onward. We are at y=0 at turn 24.\n\n We are given the car state at turn 24 (t1=24). Then for each future turn T (>=24), we can compute the car positions.\n\n How to represent the car spans for a freeway k at turn T?\n\n For freeway k, we have a list of cars. Each car is given by (head, tail, direction, speed) at turn 24.\n\n Then for turn T (absolute turn, T>=24), the relative time passed is dt = T - 24.\n\n For a car with direction 'left' and speed s:\n      new_head = head - s * dt\n      new_tail = tail - s * dt\n\n For a car with direction 'right' and speed s:\n      new_head = head + s * dt   [but note: the original representation for right was (head, tail) but in the update they use [tau, h] -> [tau + s*dt, h+s*dt]? Actually, the update rule:\n\n      For right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\n      But in the table, the car is given as (head, tail, ...). How to interpret?\n\n      In the table for freeway 3, we have: (48, 37, right, 12). But note that for a right-moving car, the head should be greater than the tail? Actually, the update rule for right says: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\" meaning the tail is first? But the table says (head, tail). \n\n      Let me check the example: freeway 3: (48,37,right,12) -> at t1=24, the span is [tau, h] = [37,48]? But the table says head=48, tail=37. So the head is the front? Then for right-moving, the head is the rightmost? So the car spans from tail to head? Then the update rule for right: \n          Span(T) = [tau + s*(dt), head + s*(dt)]\n\n      Similarly, left-moving: head is the leftmost? Then the update: [head - s*dt, tail - s*dt]? But the update rule says for left: \"Span(t1)=[h, tau] -> [h-s*dt, tau-s*dt]\". So the head is the leftmost? Then the car goes from h to tau? But that would be from left to right? Actually, no: if the car is moving left, then the entire car moves left. The head (leftmost) becomes h-s*dt and the tail (rightmost) becomes tau-s*dt.\n\n      So in the table, for a car (h, tau, d, s):\n        if d='left': the car occupies [h, tau] at t1? But wait, if h is the leftmost and tau the rightmost? Then the span is [h, tau]. But then moving left, the entire segment moves left by s per turn.\n\n        if d='right': the car occupies [tau, h] at t1? But that would be if tau is the leftmost and h the rightmost? But the table lists (head, tail). For consistency, let's see:\n\n        In the update rule for right: they write [tau, h] and then [tau+s*dt, h+s*dt]. So the head is the rightmost? Then the tail is the leftmost? \n\n        Actually, the problem says for right: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\" meaning the tail is the leftmost? That would be consistent because then the car extends from tau (left) to h (right). And when moving right, both increase.\n\n        But in the table, they list (head, tail) for each car. How should we interpret?\n\n        The problem states: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\"\n\n        And then for left: update uses h and tau as the head and tail? For right: they use tau and h? \n\n        This is confusing. Let me look at the update rule again:\n\n        Left-moving: \n            initial: [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]\n        Right-moving:\n            initial: [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]\n\n        So the representation of the car in the table for right-moving is given as (head, tail) but then the update uses the tail as the leftmost and the head as the rightmost? \n\n        Therefore, for a right-moving car, the head in the table is actually the rightmost, and the tail is the leftmost. Similarly, for left-moving, the head is the leftmost and the tail is the rightmost.\n\n        So when we see (48,37,right,12) for freeway 3, that means:\n            at turn 24: the car spans from tail=37 (leftmost) to head=48 (rightmost). So the span is [37,48].\n\n        Then at turn T, the span becomes [37 + 12*(T-24), 48 + 12*(T-24)].\n\n        Similarly, for a left-moving car: (48,83,left,36) at freeway 1: \n            at turn 24: the car spans from head=48 (leftmost) to tail=83 (rightmost) -> [48,83].\n            at turn T: [48 - 36*(T-24), 83 - 36*(T-24)].\n\n Now, we need to check at a given turn T and freeway k: is there a car on freeway k such that 0 is in the span of that car at turn T?\n\n Example: freeway 1 at turn 24: car [48,83] -> does 0 lie in [48,83]? No.\n\n How about at a later turn? We must compute.\n\n Approach:\n\n We are going to try to simulate with BFS or Dijkstra? But note: the state is (turn, y). The turn can be from 24 onward, and y in [0,9]. We want the minimal H to reach y=9.\n\n However, the state space is small: turns are unbounded? But we can set an upper bound. Since we want minimal turns, and we can only move one step at a time, the maximum turns we need is not too large. We can set an upper bound of, say, 50 turns? But let's see: the minimal without obstacles is 9 turns. With obstacles, we might have to wait or detour, but note we cannot go below 0, so the detour is limited.\n\n Alternatively, we can simulate until we reach y=9.\n\n Steps:\n\n   We are at state: (t, y) at turn t (absolute). We start at (24,0). We consider actions: U, D, S.\n\n   For each action, we compute the next y:\n\n        if action U: y_next = min(9, y+1)\n        if action D: y_next = max(0, y-1)\n        if action S: y_next = y\n\n   But note: if we are at y=0 and action D: y_next = 0.\n\n   Then at the next state: (t+1, y_next)\n\n   However, we must check the current state (at turn t) for collision: at turn t, we are on freeway y (the current y). If y is 0 or 9, no car -> safe. If y in [1,8], then we must check the car list for that freeway at turn t.\n\n        For each car on freeway y:\n            Let dt = t - 24.\n            For a left-moving car (h, tau, d='left', s): \n                span = [ h - s*dt, tau - s*dt ]\n            For a right-moving car (h, tau, d='right', s): \n                span = [ tau + s*dt, h + s*dt ]   [because for right, the head is the rightmost and tail is the leftmost]\n\n            Then check if 0 is in [min(span), max(span)]? Actually, the span might be given in increasing order? \n\n            For left: the head is the leftmost and tail the rightmost, so the interval is [head - s*dt, tail - s*dt] and since head<=tail? In the example: (48,83) -> 48<=83? Then the interval is [48-... , 83-...] and it is increasing? But if the car moves left, the entire interval shifts left, so the left endpoint becomes smaller? \n\n            However, we must note: the interval might wrap? No, it's a linear freeway. So we can represent as an interval [L, R] and check if 0 is between L and R.\n\n            But note: the problem says \"collision if 0 in Span(T)\". So we can do:\n\n                if L <= 0 <= R then collision.\n\n            However, for a right-moving car: the representation we have is [tau+s*dt, head+s*dt] and since tau <= head? Then the interval is [tau+s*dt, head+s*dt] and increasing.\n\n        So algorithm for collision at (t, y) for freeway y (if y in [1,8]):\n\n            dt = t - 24\n            for each car on freeway y:\n                if car is left:\n                    L = h - s*dt\n                    R = tau - s*dt   # and note: h <= tau? In the example: h=48, tau=83 -> so L=48-... and R=83-... -> so L<=R?\n                if car is right:\n                    L = tau + s*dt   # because tau is the leftmost\n                    R = h + s*dt     # and h is the rightmost, so L<=R.\n\n            Then check: if L <= 0 <= R -> collision.\n\n        If there is at least one car on freeway y at turn t that has 0 in [L, R], then we collide.\n\n   Therefore, we can simulate:\n\n        We start at (24,0): \n            y=0 -> no collision (safe)\n\n        Then we try actions: U, D, S.\n\n        But note: at turn 24, we are at (24,0). Then we choose an action a_24. Then at turn 25, we will be at y_next.\n\n        However, at turn 24: after choosing an action, we move to the next state at turn 25? But note: the action at turn 24 affects our position at turn 25? \n\n        Actually, the update: \n            y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\n        So at turn 24, we choose a_24. Then at turn 25, we are at y_25 = y_24 + Delta(a_24).\n\n        But when do we check for collision? At turn T, we are at freeway y_T. So at turn 24, we are at freeway 0 -> safe. Then at turn 25, we are at freeway y_25.\n\n        Therefore, we check collision at each turn T for the freeway we are at at T.\n\n        So for the state (t, y): we check collision at turn t for freeway y.\n\n        Then we choose an action to go to (t+1, y_next). Then at (t+1, y_next) we check collision at turn t+1 for freeway y_next.\n\n   We want to reach a state (t, 9) for some t. Then H = t - 24? \n\n        Because the sequence of actions: \n            at turn 24: a_24 -> leads to state at turn 25: y_25\n            at turn 25: a_25 -> leads to state at turn 26: y_26\n            ...\n            at turn 24+H-1: we are at y_{24+H-1}=9.\n\n        So the number of actions is H, and we use turns from 24 to 24+H-1.\n\n        Therefore, we are done at the state (t,9) with t = 24+H-1, so H = t - 24 + 1? \n\n        Actually, if we take H actions: from t=24 to t=24+H-1 (H actions: at t=24, t=24+1, ... t=24+H-1) then the state after the last action is at turn 24+H.\n\n        But note: we start at turn 24 at y=0. Then after the first action (at turn 24) we are at turn 25 at y1. Then after H actions, we are at turn 24+H at y_H.\n\n        We want y_H = 9.\n\n        Therefore, we are looking for the minimal H such that we are at (24+H, 9) and we did not collide in any turn from 24 to 24+H-1? \n\n        Actually, at turn 24: we are at (24,0) -> we don't check for collision? Because the freeway is 0? So safe.\n\n        Then at turn 25: we are at (25, y1) and we check collision at turn 25 for freeway y1.\n\n        Then at turn 24+H: we are at (24+H, 9) and we don't check collision for freeway 9? Because the problem says cars are on freeways 1..8. So freeway 9 is safe.\n\n        Therefore, we need to simulate until we are at y=9 at some turn.\n\n        We are to find the minimal H (number of actions) such that we are at y=9 at turn 24+H.\n\n        And we must avoid collision at every turn from 25 to 24+H-1? Actually, at the turns we are on freeway 1..8.\n\n        Specifically, we must avoid collision at turn t for the freeway we are on at turn t, for every t from 24 to 24+H-1? \n\n        But note: at turn 24 we are at freeway 0 -> safe. So we don't need to check turn 24? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if ... for any car on freeway y_T\". At turn 24, we are at freeway 0, and there is no car on freeway 0 -> safe.\n\n        Then we check:\n\n          turn 24: safe (freeway0)\n          turn 25: check freeway y_25 (if in [1,8] then check cars, else safe)\n          ...\n          turn 24+H: we are at freeway 9 -> safe.\n\n        Therefore, we only need to check turns 25 to 24+H-1? Because at turn 24+H we are at freeway9 and safe.\n\n        But note: the state at turn 24+H is the result of the last action at turn 24+H-1. And we are at freeway9 at turn 24+H -> safe. So the last turn that could be dangerous is turn 24+H-1? \n\n        Actually, the actions:\n\n            Turn 24: action a_24 -> moves us to state at turn 25: y_25.\n            Turn 25: action a_25 -> moves us to state at turn 26: y_26.\n            ...\n            Turn 24+H-1: action a_{24+H-1} -> moves us to state at turn 24+H: y_{24+H}=9.\n\n        Then we stop. The last action is at turn 24+H-1.\n\n        And we must avoid collision at every intermediate state: at turn 24 (safe), then at turn 25 (if y_25 in [1,8] we check), ... until turn 24+H-1 (if y_{24+H-1} in [1,8] we check). And at turn 24+H we are at 9 -> safe.\n\n        Therefore, we must avoid collision at every turn from 25 to 24+H-1.\n\n Implementation:\n\n        We can do BFS in state (t, y) for t>=24 and y in [0,9]. We want to reach (t,9) for the minimal t (or minimal H = t-24).\n\n        We start at (24,0) with cost=0 (number of actions so far is 0).\n\n        Then we consider actions: U, D, S.\n\n        The next state: (t+1, y_next) and we check:\n\n          - For the new state (t+1, y_next): we must check collision at turn t+1? Actually, at turn t+1 we are at freeway y_next.\n\n          - If y_next is 0 or 9 -> safe.\n\n          - If y_next in [1,8]: then we compute the car spans for freeway y_next at turn t+1 (absolute turn = t+1, relative dt = t+1-24).\n\n        If it is safe, then we add state (t+1, y_next) to the BFS queue.\n\n        We want to minimize H = (t+1) - 24? Actually, the number of actions taken so far is the cost. We started at turn 24 and after k actions we are at turn 24+k. We want to be at y=9.\n\n        So in state (t, y), the cost is (t - 24) and we are about to take an action that will lead to state (t+1, y_next) with cost (t+1 - 24).\n\n        We want to find the minimal H such that we are at y=9 at turn 24+H. Then the number of actions is H.\n\n        We can break when we reach (t,9) for any t. And the minimal t will give minimal H.\n\n        However, note that we might have multiple paths and we want the minimal H. So we can use BFS by the absolute turn? But the cost is the number of actions (which is t-24). And we want to minimize that.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            Let dist[t][y] = minimal number of actions to reach (t,y) without collision? But we can also do:\n\n            We use a queue that stores (t, y, actions_so_far) and we break when we first see y=9.\n\n        Since we are only moving one step per turn, we can do a BFS by time (turn). We start at t=24, then t=25, then t=26, etc.\n\n        We maintain a visited set: (t,y). But note: we might come to the same y at a later turn? But we are trying to minimize the total turns. So if we have reached (t,y) and we see a way to get to (t', y) with t'<t, then we don't need to consider the state with t'. Actually, we are doing BFS by time (increasing t), so when we first reach y=9, that is the minimal H.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n            Let Q be a queue.\n            Mark visited[24][0] = True.\n            Q.push( (24,0) )   [turn and y]\n\n            parent[t][y] = (prev_t, prev_y, action) to record the path.\n\n            Then while Q is not empty:\n                pop state (t, y)\n\n                if y == 9: then we found a solution. H = t - 24. Then we backtrack to get the actions.\n\n                Otherwise, for each action in [U, D, S]:\n                    y_next = \n                         if U: min(9, y+1)\n                         if D: max(0, y-1)\n                         if S: y\n\n                    t_next = t+1\n\n                    Check: if we are at (t_next, y_next) and we have not visited (t_next, y_next) at an earlier time? Actually, we are doing BFS by time so we will visit states in increasing t. But we might visit the same (t_next, y_next) multiple times? But we can mark visited per (t,y). \n\n                    Then check collision at turn t_next for freeway y_next:\n\n                         if y_next == 0 or y_next == 9: safe.\n\n                         else: \n                            dt = t_next - 24\n                            for each car on freeway y_next:\n                                compute the interval [L, R] as described.\n                                if any car has L <= 0 <= R -> collision -> skip this action.\n\n                    If safe, and we haven't visited (t_next, y_next) at turn t_next? We might have visited the same y at the same turn? Actually, at a given turn t_next, we can only be at one y? But we are considering the state (t_next, y_next). And we are going to visit that state only once per turn? So we can mark visited[t_next][y_next] = True.\n\n                    Then push (t_next, y_next) into the queue.\n\n            Then when we pop (t,9), we backtrack to get the actions.\n\n        But note: we might have multiple ways to reach the same (t,y). But we are doing BFS by time and we want the minimal time. So the first time we reach (t,9) is the minimal t. Then H = t - 24.\n\n        However, we must record the path.\n\n        We can store:\n\n            parent[t][y] = (t_prev, y_prev, action_taken_at_t_prev) \n\n            Then to backtrack: \n                at (t,9): \n                    we know the action at turn t-1 was a_{t-1} that led to (t,9). \n                    then we go to state (t-1, y_prev) and so on until (24,0).\n\n            Then we get the sequence of actions: from turn 24 to turn t-1.\n\n        But note: the action at turn 24 leads to state at turn 25. So the sequence of actions is for turns: 24, 25, ... , t-1.\n\n        And the number of actions = (t-1) - 24 + 1 = t-24.\n\n        But we are at turn t (with y=9) and we took the last action at turn t-1. So the actions are from turn 24 to turn t-1: that's (t-1)-24+1 = t-24 actions.\n\n        And H = t-24? But the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\".\n\n        Here, t1 = 24, so the actions are for t1+0, t1+1, ... t1+H-1.\n\n        So H = t - 24? Then the actions are from 24 to 24+H-1 = t-1.\n\n        Therefore, we have H = t - 24.\n\n        Then the sequence: \n            Turn 24: a_24\n            Turn 25: a_25\n            ...\n            Turn 24+H-1: a_{24+H-1} = a_{t-1}\n\n        And then at turn 24+H = t, we are at y=9.\n\n        So we need to output the actions for turns 24 to t-1.\n\n Implementation details:\n\n        We'll use a dictionary: parent = {}  # key: (t,y), value: (prev_t, prev_y, action_at_prev_t)\n\n        We start at (24,0). We set parent[(24,0)] = None.\n\n        Then we do BFS:\n\n            from collections import deque\n            Q = deque()\n            Q.append((24,0))\n\n            visited = set()\n            visited.add((24,0))\n\n            found = False\n            while Q:\n                t, y = Q.popleft()\n\n                if y == 9:\n                    # found solution\n                    # backtrack to get the actions\n                    actions = []\n                    state = (t,y)\n                    # we want to go back until we get to (24,0)\n                    # the parent of (t,y) is (t_prev, y_prev, action) such that from (t_prev, y_prev) we took action to get to (t,y)\n                    # but note: the action taken at turn t_prev leads to state at turn t_prev+1 = t.\n                    # so the actions we have in the chain are from the first action at turn 24 to the last action at turn t-1.\n\n                    # However, we start at (24,0) and we haven't taken an action at turn 24? \n                    # Actually, at (24,0) we are at the start. Then we take an action at turn 24 to go to the next state at turn 25.\n\n                    # So we backtrack:\n\n                    current = (t,y)\n                    path = []\n                    while parent[current] is not None:\n                        prev_t, prev_y, action = parent[current]\n                        # action was taken at turn prev_t -> led to current at turn prev_t+1.\n                        path.append( (prev_t, action) )\n                        current = (prev_t, prev_y)\n                    # Now current is (24,0) and parent[ (24,0) ] is None.\n\n                    path.reverse()   # so that we have from turn 24 to turn t-1\n                    # Then the actions: for turn in [24, 25, ..., t-1] we have the action.\n\n                    # But note: the path we have: \n                    #   we have a list of (turn, action) for the action taken at that turn.\n                    #   so for turn=24: we have an action, then turn=25: ... until turn=t-1.\n\n                    # Then we output:\n                    #   Turn 24: action for turn24\n                    #   Turn 25: action for turn25\n                    #   ...\n\n                    # And H = t - 24.\n\n                    # Then we break.\n\n                    found = True\n                    break\n\n                # Otherwise, for each action in ['U','D','S']:\n                for a in ['U','D','S']:\n                    if a=='U':\n                        y_next = y+1\n                        if y_next>9: \n                            y_next=9\n                    elif a=='D':\n                        y_next = y-1\n                        if y_next<0:\n                            y_next=0\n                    else: # S\n                        y_next = y\n\n                    t_next = t+1\n\n                    # Check if we have visited (t_next, y_next) already? \n                    # We are doing BFS by time: we are visiting t in increasing order.

So we must check both.\n\n        Example: freeway 8 at turn 24: \n            car1: (48,37,'right',6) -> at turn24: [37+0, 48+0] = [37,48] -> doesn't include 0? \n            car2: (0,-11,'right',6) -> at turn24: [ -11+0, 0+0] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? \n\n            But note: the car representation: for right, the head is the rightmost? So (0,-11) means: \n                head=0 (rightmost), tail=-11 (leftmost). So the car spans from -11 to 0. So at turn24, it includes 0? \n\n            Then at turn24, if we are at freeway8, we collide? \n\n            However, we start at turn24 at freeway0. Then we move to freeway8 only at a later turn? \n\n            At a later turn T (>=24), the car2: \n                L = -11 + 6*(T-24)\n                R = 0 + 6*(T-24)\n\n            So at turn T, the car spans from -11+6*(T-24) to 0+6*(T-24). \n\n            We require 0 to be in [L, R]? \n                L = -11 + 6*(T-24) <= 0 <= 0 + 6*(T-24) \n                => 0 <= 6*(T-24)  -> T>=24 -> true.\n                and -11+6*(T-24) <=0 -> 6*(T-24) <= 11 -> T-24 <= 11/6 -> T-24 <= 1.83 -> so T<=25.83\n\n            Since T is integer: T=24,25.\n\n            So at turn24: T=24 -> [ -11,0] -> 0 is included -> collision if we are at freeway8 at turn24? \n            But we are not at freeway8 at turn24.\n\n            At turn25: \n                L = -11+6= -5\n                R = 0+6=6\n                so [ -5,6] -> 0 is included? -> collision.\n\n            At turn26: \n                L = -11+12=1\n                R = 0+12=12\n                so [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\n            Therefore, if we are at freeway8 at turn24 or turn25, we collide? But we are not at turn24. At turn25: if we move to freeway8 at turn25, we collide? \n\n            So we must avoid being at freeway8 at turns 24 and 25? But we start at turn24 at freeway0. Then at turn25, we can be at freeway1 (if we move up from 0) or freeway0 (if we stay or move down).\n\n            So freeway8 is only reached later? \n\n            But note: to get to freeway8, we must start at freeway0 and then move up 8 times? So at least 8 actions -> turn24+8 = 32? Then at turn32: \n                dt=32-24=8\n                car2: L = -11+6*8 = -11+48=37, R=0+48=48 -> [37,48] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n\n            So freeway8 is safe from turn26 onward? \n\n        Therefore, we can avoid freeway8 until turn26? \n\n        We'll code the BFS accordingly.\n\n        We'll set an upper bound on t? Since the minimal without obstacles is 9, and with obstacles we might have to wait a few turns, we can set a limit, say, 50? \n\n        We'll run the BFS until we find the goal.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Initialize:\n                car_state = {\n                    1: [(48,83,'left',36)],\n                    2: [(48,83,'left',36)],\n                    3: [(48,37,'right',12), (12,1,'right',12), (-24,-35,'right',12)],\n                    4: [(48,37,'right',12), (12,1,'right',12), (-24,-35,'right',12)],\n                    5: [(48,37,'right',12), (12,1,'right',12), (-24,-35,'right',12)],\n                    6: [(48,37,'right',6)],\n                    7: [(48,37,'right',6)],\n                    8: [(48,37,'right',6), (0,-11,'right',6)]\n                }\n\n            Then run the BFS as described.\n\n        Let's hope we don't have to wait too long.\n\n        We'll code and run.\n\n        However, we can also try to reason: \n\n          The dangerous freeways are 8 at turn24 and 25? But we are not at 8 at those turns.\n\n          What about freeway1 and 2? \n            freeway1: left-moving car: (48,83,left,36) at turn24: [48,83] -> 0 not included.\n            at turn T: [48-36*(T-24), 83-36*(T-24)]\n\n            When will 0 be in the interval?\n                48-36*(T-24) <= 0 <= 83-36*(T-24)\n\n            Solve:\n                First: 0 <= 83-36*(T-24) -> 36*(T-24) <= 83 -> T-24 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.3 -> so T<=26.3 -> T=24,25,26? \n                and 48-36*(T-24) <=0 -> 36*(T-24)>=48 -> T-24>=48/36=4/3≈1.33 -> T>=25.33 -> so T=26? \n\n            At T=26:\n                L = 48-36*2 = 48-72 = -24\n                R = 83-72=11\n                so 0 is in [-24,11] -> so at turn26, freeway1 is dangerous.\n\n            Similarly, freeway2: same.\n\n          Freeway3,4,5: \n            We have three cars. Let's check the one that might be near 0?\n\n            The third car: (-24,-35,right,12): \n                at turn T: [ -35 + 12*(T-24), -24+12*(T-24) ]\n                We want 0 in [L,R]:\n                    L = -35+12*(T-24) <=0<= -24+12*(T-24)\n                Solve:\n                    0<=-24+12*(T-24) -> 12*(T-24)>=24 -> T-24>=2 -> T>=26\n                    and -35+12*(T-24)<=0 -> 12*(T-24)<=35 -> T-24<=35/12≈2.91 -> T<=26.91 -> so T=26,27?\n\n                At T=26: \n                    L = -35+12*2 = -35+24=-11\n                    R = -24+24=0\n                    so [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> collision.\n\n                At T=27:\n                    L = -35+12*3 = -35+36=1\n                    R = -24+36=12\n                    -> 0 not included.\n\n            So freeway3,4,5 are dangerous at turn26? \n\n            The other cars on freeway3,4,5: \n                (48,37,right,12): at T=26: [37+12*2=37+24=61, 48+24=72] -> safe\n                (12,1,right,12): [1+24=25, 12+24=36] -> safe.\n\n          Freeway6 and 7: \n            (48,37,right,6): \n                at T: [37+6*(T-24), 48+6*(T-24)]\n                at T=26: [37+12=49, 48+12=60] -> safe\n            So no problem.\n\n          Freeway8: \n            We already saw: at T=24 and 25: dangerous? But we won't be there that early? \n            Then at T=26: \n                car1: [37+6*2=49, 48+12=60] -> safe\n                car2: [-11+6*2=1, 0+12=12] -> [1,12] -> safe? 0 not included.\n\n            So freeway8 is safe at T>=26.\n\n          Therefore, the dangerous turns for freeways 1,2,3,4,5 are at turn26? \n\n          Specifically:\n            freeway1: dangerous at turn26? (as computed: [-24,11] includes 0)\n            freeway2: same.\n            freeway3,4,5: dangerous at turn26? (because of the third car: [-11,0] at turn26)\n\n          So we must avoid being at freeway1,2,3,4,5 at turn26.\n\n          How to avoid? \n\n          We start at (24,0). We must get to 9. \n\n          The minimal path: 0->1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9: 9 actions -> turn24+9=33? \n\n          But we are concerned about turn26? \n\n          How do we get to turn26? \n\n          At turn24: we are at 0.\n          At turn25: we can be at 0 or 1.\n          At turn26: we can be at 0,1,2.\n\n          So at turn26, we can only be at freeway 0,1,2. \n\n          But freeway1 and 2 are dangerous at turn26? \n\n          Therefore, we must be at freeway0 at turn26? \n\n          How? \n\n          Option1: \n            turn24: S or D -> stay at 0 -> turn25: at0\n            turn25: S or D -> stay at 0 -> turn26: at0 -> safe.\n\n          Then at turn26: we are at0. Then we can start moving up.\n\n          Then the path:\n\n            turn24: S (or D) -> stay at0\n            turn25: S (or D) -> stay at0\n            turn26: U -> to1\n            turn27: U -> to2\n            ... until turn34: U -> to8\n            turn35: U -> to9 -> done.\n\n          Total actions: 11? H=11.\n\n          But is there a faster way? \n\n          What if we move up at turn24 to1? Then at turn25 we are at1 -> freeway1 at turn25: \n            freeway1 at turn25: \n                dt=1\n                car: [48-36=12, 83-36=47] -> [12,47] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n\n            Then at turn25: we are at1. Then at turn26: we can choose: U (to2), D (to0), S (to1).\n\n            But freeway1 at turn26: [48-72=-24, 83-72=11] -> includes 0 -> unsafe.\n\n            So we cannot stay at1 at turn26.\n\n            We cannot go up to2? freeway2 at turn26: same as freeway1: unsafe.\n\n            We can go down to0? \n                At turn26: we move to0 -> then we are at0 at turn26 -> safe.\n\n            Then the path:\n\n                turn24: U -> to1 (turn25: safe)\n                turn25: D -> to0 (turn26: safe at0)\n\n                Then we lost progress? Then we are at0 at turn26. Then we have to go up again.\n\n                Then we do:\n\n                turn26: U->1\n                turn27: U->2\n                ... until turn34: U->8\n                turn35: U->9\n\n                Total H=12? \n\n            Alternatively, we can at turn25: stay at1? -> unsafe at turn26? so we must move.\n\n            So we have to go down at turn25? \n\n          Another option: at turn24: we go up to1 (safe at turn25). Then at turn25: we go up to2? \n                at turn26: we are at2 -> freeway2 at turn26: which is unsafe (as computed).\n\n          So we cannot be at1 or2 at turn26.\n\n          Therefore, we must be at0 at turn26.\n\n          Then the minimal path: \n\n            We must wait two turns at0? Then we start going up.\n\n            Then we need 9 moves up -> 9 turns. Total turns: 2 (wait) + 9 (up) = 11.\n\n          But note: we start at turn24: \n                turn24: S -> at0 (turn25)\n                turn25: S -> at0 (turn26)\n                turn26: U -> at1 (turn27)\n                turn27: U -> at2 (turn28)\n                turn28: U -> at3 (turn29)\n                turn29: U -> at4 (turn30)\n                turn30: U -> at5 (turn31)\n                turn31: U -> at6 (turn32)\n                turn32: U -> at7 (turn33)\n                turn33: U -> at8 (turn34)\n                turn34: U -> at9 (turn35)\n\n            Then we are at9 at turn35. The actions: from turn24 to turn34 (inclusive) -> 11 actions.\n\n          But wait: the goal is to be at9 at the turn after the last action. At turn34 we take the last action (U) and then at turn35 we are at9. So we stop.\n\n          Therefore, the sequence: 11 actions.\n\n          However, is there a way to avoid waiting two turns? \n\n          We note that freeway3,4,5 are dangerous at turn26? But we are at0,1,2 at turn26. So we don't care about freeway3,4,5 at turn26? \n\n          The problem is only freeway1 and2 at turn26.\n\n          What if we move to freeway3 at a later turn? \n\n          We computed freeway3 is dangerous at turn26? But we are not at freeway3 at turn26? \n\n          We are at0 at turn26. Then we move up: at turn27 we are at1 -> freeway1 at turn27: \n                dt=3\n                freeway1: [48-36*3=48-108=-60, 83-108=-25] -> [-60,-25] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n\n          So after turn26, freeway1 and2 become safe? \n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n            turn24: S -> 0 (turn25: safe)\n            turn25: S -> 0 (turn26: safe)\n            turn26: U -> 1 (turn27: safe) -> because freeway1 at turn27: [-60,-25] -> safe.\n            then we can move up without waiting.\n\n          But what about freeway3? \n\n          We are at freeway3 at which turn? \n            turn27: y=1 -> freeway1\n            turn28: y=2 -> freeway2\n            turn29: y=3 -> freeway3 -> at turn29: dt=5\n\n          Check freeway3 at turn29:\n            The third car: (-24,-35,right,12): \n                at dt=5: L=-35+12*5=-35+60=25, R=-24+60=36 -> [25,36] -> safe.\n\n            The other cars are even further.\n\n          So freeway3 at turn29 is safe.\n\n          Similarly, freeway4 and5: same as freeway3? \n\n          But note: the car_state for freeway3,4,5 are identical? \n\n          Then the path: \n            turn24: S\n            turn25: S\n            turn26: U\n            turn27: U ->2\n            turn28: U ->3\n            turn29: U ->4\n            turn30: U ->5\n            turn31: U ->6\n            turn32: U ->7\n            turn33: U ->8\n            turn34: U ->9\n\n          Then at turn34: we take the last action (U) and at turn35 we are at9. \n\n          But wait: at turn34, we are at8? and then we do U to go to9 at turn35.\n\n          How many actions? from turn24 to turn34: 11 actions? \n\n          The sequence: \n            turn24: S\n            turn25: S\n            turn26: U\n            turn27: U\n            ... until turn34: U\n\n          That's 11 actions: turns 24,25,...,34.\n\n          So H=11.\n\n          Is there a way to do it in 10? \n\n          We must start moving earlier? \n\n          Option: \n            turn24: U -> to1 (safe at turn25: freeway1 at turn25: [48-36=12, 83-36=47] -> safe)\n            turn25: we cannot stay at1 (because turn26: freeway1 at turn26: unsafe) -> we must go down to0? \n            turn25: D -> to0 (safe at turn26: freeway0)\n            then we are at0 at turn26. Then we have to go up 9 times? \n                turn26: U->1 (turn27: safe? freeway1 at turn27: [48-36*3=-60,83-108=-25] -> safe)\n                turn27: U->2\n                ... until turn35: U->9? \n\n            Then the actions: \n                turn24: U\n                turn25: D\n                turn26: U\n                turn27: U\n                ... until turn34: U -> then at turn35: we are at9? \n\n            How many actions? 11: turn24 to turn34.\n\n          But we moved up at turn24 and then down at turn25: net progress 0. Then we start again. So same as waiting two turns? \n\n          Alternatively, can we move up twice in the beginning? \n\n            turn24: U->1 (safe)\n            turn25: U->2? \n                at turn26: we are at2 -> freeway2 at turn26: [48-72=-24,83-72=11] -> includes0 -> unsafe.\n\n          So we cannot.\n\n          Therefore, minimal H=11.\n\n        But wait: what about freeway8? We saw that at turn26 it becomes safe? And we are at freeway8 at turn34? \n            turn34: dt=34-24=10\n            freeway8: \n                car1: [37+6*10=97, 48+60=108] -> safe\n                car2: [-11+60=49,0+60=60] -> safe.\n\n          So safe.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\n        We can output:\n\n            Turn 24: S\n            Turn 25: S\n            Turn 26: U\n            Turn 27: U\n            Turn 28: U\n            Turn 29: U\n            Turn 30: U\n            Turn 31: U\n            Turn 32: U\n            Turn 33: U\n            Turn 34: U\n\n        But note: at turn34: we are at8? then after the last action (U at turn34) we go to9 at turn35.\n\n        However, we could also use D at the beginning? but that also results in staying at0. So same.\n\n        But note: at turn24: we could do D -> same as S? because at0, D stays at0.\n\n        So we can output:\n\n            Turn 24: D   # or S, same effect\n            Turn 25: D   # or S\n            then the rest U.\n\n        But to be consistent, we can choose S? \n\n        However, the problem says: at y=0, D: y_next = max(0,0-1)=0 -> same as S.\n\n        So we can choose either. Let's choose S.\n\n        Alternatively, we can choose D? \n\n        But note: the problem does not specify that we must avoid unnecessary moves? So either is acceptable.\n\n        We'll choose S.\n\n        Therefore, the answer:\n\n            Turn 24: S\n            Turn 25: S\n            Turn 26: U\n            Turn 27: U\n            Turn 28: U\n            Turn 29: U\n            Turn 30: U\n            Turn 31: U\n            Turn 32: U\n            Turn 33: U\n            Turn 34: U\n\n        But wait: we need 9 U's? from turn26 to turn34: that's 9 U's -> from0 to9? \n\n        At turn26: we start at0 -> U at turn26: to1 at turn27? \n        Then at turn27: U to2 at turn28\n        ... \n        at turn34: U: from8 to9 at turn35.\n\n        So that's 9 U's and two S's? total 11 actions.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Turn24: S\n            Turn25: S\n            Turn26: U -> at turn27:1\n            Turn27: U ->2\n            Turn28: U ->3\n            Turn29: U ->4\n            Turn30: U ->5\n            Turn31: U ->6\n            Turn32: U ->7\n            Turn33: U ->8\n            Turn34: U ->9\n\n        Correct.\n\n        We'll code the BFS to confirm.\n\n        But since we reasoned and found a path of 11, and we cannot do 9 because of the obstacle at turn26, we expect the BFS to return 11.\n\n        Let me run the BFS mentally for the first few turns:\n\n          Start: (24,0) -> safe.\n\n          Then we consider actions: \n            U: leads to (25,1) -> check freeway1 at turn25: \n                 car: [48-36=12, 83-36=47] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n            D: (25,0) -> safe (freeway0)\n            S: (25,0) -> safe.\n\n          Then from (25,0): \n              U: (26,1) -> freeway1 at turn26: [48-72=-24,83-72=11] -> 0 included -> unsafe.\n              D: (26,0) -> safe (freeway0)\n              S: (26,0) -> safe.\n\n          Then from (25,1):\n              U: (26,2) -> freeway2 at turn26: same as freeway1 -> unsafe.\n              D: (26,0) -> safe.\n              S: (26,1) -> unsafe.\n\n          So from (25,1): only D leads to safe (26,0).\n\n          Then from (26,0): \n              We can do U: (27,1) -> freeway1 at turn27: [48-36*3=-60,83-108=-25] -> safe.\n              D: (27,0) -> safe.\n              S: (27,0) -> safe.\n\n          Then we continue.\n\n          We see that the state (26,0) is safe. Then we do U at turn26 to go to (27,1) -> safe.\n\n          Then we can do U every turn until we get to9.\n\n          The path: \n            (24,0) -> S to (25,0) -> S to (26,0) -> U to (27,1) -> U to (28,2) -> ... -> (35,9)\n\n          Then the actions: \n            turn24: S\n            turn25: S\n            turn26: U\n            turn27: U\n            ... turn34: U\n\n          That's 11 actions.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            Turn 24: S\n            Turn 25: S\n            Turn 26: U\n            Turn 27: U\n            Turn 28: U\n            Turn 29: U\n            Turn 30: U\n            Turn 31: U\n            Turn 32: U\n            Turn 33: U\n            Turn 34: U\n\n        But note: the last action (turn34: U) leads to y=9 at turn35.\n\n        So the sequence has 11 actions.\n\n        We'll code the BFS to confirm and to get the exact path.\n\n        However, we can also note: there might be other paths? But the minimal H is 11.\n\n        We'll run the BFS with a limit of t=24+20 (to be safe) and we expect to find a solution at t=35 (which is 11 actions).\n\n        But note: the state (t,y) for t from 24 to 35 and y from0 to9: 12*10=120 states -> manageable.\n\n        We'll code in Python? But the problem requires the answer. Since we already reasoned, we can output.\n\n        However, to be thorough, we'll write a small BFS in mind? \n\n        We'll simulate:\n\n          Level0: (24,0) -> cost0.\n\n          Level1: (25,0) by S or D, and (25,1) by U.\n\n          Level2: \n             from (25,0): \n                 (26,0) by S or D -> safe.\n                 (26,1) by U -> unsafe.\n             from (25,1):\n                 (26,0) by D -> safe.  -> so (26,0) is reached by two paths.\n\n          Level2: state (26,0)\n\n          Level3: \n             from (26,0): \n                 (27,0) by S or D -> safe.\n                 (27,1) by U -> safe? \n                    freeway1 at turn27: dt=3 -> [48-108=-60, 83-108=-25] -> safe.\n\n          Level3: states (27,0) and (27,1)\n\n          Then from (27,0): we can go to (28,0), (28,1) [by U] -> but we are in a hurry to go up? \n          But we want minimal H, so we should try to go up as much as possible? \n\n          However, we are doing BFS by time. The first time we reach (27,1) is at level3? Then we can go from (27,1) to (28,2) (if we do U) -> check freeway2 at turn28: \n             freeway2: dt=4 -> [48-36*4=48-144=-96, 83-144=-61] -> safe.\n\n          Then (28,2) -> then (29,3) -> check freeway3 at turn29: \n             freeway3: \n                 car1: (48,37,right,12): [37+12*5=37+60=97,48+60=108] -> safe.\n                 car2: (12,1,right,12): [1+60=61,12+60=72] -> safe.\n                 car3: (-24,-35,right,12): [-35+60=25, -24+60=36] -> safe.\n\n          Then (29,3) -> (30,4) -> freeway4: same as freeway3? -> safe.\n\n          ... until (34,8) -> then (35,9) -> goal.\n\n          How many levels? \n             Level0: t=24 -> 0\n             Level1: t=25 -> 1\n             Level2: t=26 -> 2\n             Level3: t=27 -> 3\n             Level4: t=28 -> 4\n             Level5: t=29 -> 5\n             Level6: t=30 -> 6\n             Level7: t=31 -> 7\n             Level8: t=32 -> 8\n             Level9: t=33 -> 9\n             Level10: t=34 -> 10\n             Level11: t=35 -> 11\n\n          Then we reached the goal at level11? \n\n          The path: \n             turn24: S -> to (25,0) [level1]\n             turn25: S -> to (26,0) [level2]\n             turn26: U -> to (27,1) [level3]\n             turn27: U -> to (28,2) [level4]\n             turn28: U -> to (29,3) [level5]\n             turn29: U -> to (30,4) [level6]\n             turn30: U -> to (31,5) [level7]\n             turn31: U -> to (32,6) [level8]\n             turn32: U -> to (33,7) [level9]\n             turn33: U -> to (34,8) [level10]\n             turn34: U -> to (35,9) [level11]\n\n          Then the actions: \n             turn24: S\n             turn25: S\n             turn26: U\n             turn27: U\n             turn28: U\n             turn29: U\n             turn30: U\n             turn31: U\n             turn32: U\n             turn33: U\n             turn34: U\n\n          This matches.\n\n        Therefore, we output.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions\", and we found one.\n\n        We'll output in the required format.\n\n        However, we could have chosen at turn24: D and turn25: D? That would be the same. But we did S and S.\n\n        We'll output S for the first two.\n\n        Answer:\n\n            Turn 24: S\n            Turn 25: S\n            Turn 26: U\n            Turn 27: U\n            Turn 28: U\n            Turn 29: U\n            Turn 30: U\n            Turn 31: U\n            Turn 32: U\n            Turn 33: U\n            Turn 34: U\n\n        But wait: the sequence has 11 actions? The problem says the sequence is from t=24 to t=24+H-1, and H=11, so the last index is t=24+10=34. Correct.\n\n        We'll box it.\n\n        However, note: we have 11 lines? from turn24 to turn34.\n\n        Format:\n\n            Turn 24: S\n            Turn 25: S\n            Turn 26: U\n            Turn 27: U\n            Turn 28: U\n            Turn 29: U\n            Turn 30: U\n            Turn 31: U\n            Turn 32: U\n            Turn 33: U\n            Turn 34: U\n\n        This should be the minimal path.\n\n        We'll write it.\n</think>\nTo reach the goal position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn 24 while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8, the minimal number of turns required is 11. The sequence of actions is determined as follows:\n\n- At turn 24, staying (S) keeps the player at y = 0, which is safe.\n- At turn 25, staying (S) again keeps the player at y = 0, avoiding freeways 1-8.\n- Starting from turn 26, moving up (U) repeatedly for 9 consecutive turns moves the player from y = 0 to y = 9 by turn 35.\n\nThe car configurations and movements are analyzed to ensure no collisions:\n- At turn 26, freeways 1 and 2 are dangerous (cars span 0), so the player must be at y = 0 (safe).\n- From turn 27 onward, freeways 1 and 2 become safe (cars no longer span 0), allowing upward movement.\n- Freeways 3, 4, and 5 are dangerous at turn 26 but safe by turn 29 when the player reaches y = 3.\n- Freeways 6, 7, and 8 are safe for the player's path, as the player reaches them after turn 26 when they are no longer dangerous.\n\nThus, the sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 24: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 25: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 26: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 27: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 28: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 29: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 30: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 31: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 32: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 33: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 34: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 28, and I start at y=0. Actions are U (up, y increases by 1), D (down, y decreases by 1), or S (stay, y unchanged). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y=k, and for that k, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t₁=28, and they move with constant speed. For left-moving cars, the span shifts left (decreases) by s per turn, for right-moving, it shifts right (increases) by s per turn.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 quickly without being on a freeway y when a car covers position 0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn 28, and then how they move over time.\n\nFreeways y=1 to y=8:\n\n- y=1: one car, left-moving, head 48, tail 83, speed 36. Since it's left-moving, head is left, tail is right? No, let's see the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\"\n\nIt says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\". But in the span, for left-moving, [h, τ] with h and τ such that it moves left.\n\nIn the table, for y=1: (48, 83, left, 36). But 48 to 83, if it's left-moving, and it says head h=48, tail τ=83, but 48 < 83, so [48,83] which is from left to right? But it's moving left, which is decreasing.\n\nThe update: [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if h=48, τ=83, and moving left, at T=28, span [48,83]. After time, it decreases.\n\nBut position 0 is the point we care about for collision. So for y=1, at T=28, span is [48,83], so 0 is not in [48,83] since 48>0, so no collision at T=28.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nNow, since the cars move, I need to see when 0 is covered for each freeway at different turns.\n\nAlso, for multiple cars on a freeway, I need to check all of them.\n\nLet me denote ΔT = T - t₁ = T - 28, the number of turns after t₁.\n\nFor each freeway k, at turn T = 28 + ΔT, the span of each car on that freeway must not contain 0 for me to be safe if I'm on k at that turn.\n\nI start at y=0 at T=28. y=0 is not a freeway, so no cars there, so I'm safe at T=28.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is also not a freeway (freeways are y=1 to 8), so when I reach y=9, I'm done and no collision possible.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nNow, actions: I can move up, down, or stay.\n\nSince I need to go up to 9, and starting from 0, I probably want to go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nMinimal turns might be achieved by going up quickly if possible.\n\nThe minimal number of turns to go from 0 to 9 with only U actions would be 9 turns: at each turn move up, so after 9 moves, I'm at y=9.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, which could take more turns.\n\nBut since going down might be necessary to avoid, but it adds turns, so probably minimal H is at least 9, and if I can go straight up without collision, H=9.\n\nBut I need to check if at any point when I'm on a freeway, a car covers 0.\n\nLet me simulate going straight up.\n\nSuppose I do U for 9 turns.\n\nAt turn T=28, y=0, action U, so at T=29, y=1.\n\nAt T=29, I'm on y=1.\n\nNow, for y=1, there is one car: at T=28, span [48,83], left-moving, speed 36.\n\nAt turn T, position relative to T=28: ΔT = T-28\n\nSpan at T: [48 - 36ΔT, 83 - 36ΔT]\n\nSet 0 in span: 48 - 36ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 83 - 36ΔT\n\nSince 48 - 36ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 83 - 36ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36ΔT ≤ 0 => 36ΔT ≥ 48 => ΔT ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so ΔT ≥ 2 since integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 83 - 36ΔT => 36ΔT ≤ 83 => ΔT ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so ΔT ≤ 2.\n\nSo ΔT ≥ 2 and ΔT ≤ 2, so only at ΔT=2, which is T=30.\n\nAt T=30, span [48-36*2, 83-36*2] = [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11]\n\n0 is between -24 and 11, yes, so collision at T=30 on y=1.\n\nBut when I'm going up, at T=29 I'm on y=1, and T=29 is ΔT=1.\n\nAt T=29, ΔT=1, span [48-36*1, 83-36*1] = [12,47], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nAt T=30, ΔT=2, span [-24,11], 0 in, unsafe.\n\nBut at T=30, if I were on y=1, it would be unsafe.\n\nIn my plan, I start at T=28, y=0.\n\nT=28: action U, so at T=29, y=1.\n\nT=29: I'm on y=1, and since ΔT=1 for T=29, span [12,47], 0 not in, safe. Now I do action U, so at T=30, y=2.\n\nT=30: I'm on y=2, not y=1. So for y=1, unsafe at T=30, but I'm not on y=1 at T=30.\n\nNow, for y=2, let's see the cars.\n\ny=2 has same as y=1: (48,83,left,36), so same thing.\n\nAt T=30, for y=2, span [48-36*2, 83-36*2] = [-24,11], 0 in, unsafe if on y=2 at T=30.\n\nBut I am on y=2 at T=30, so collision.\n\ny=2 car: at T=28, (48,83,left,36), same as y=1.\n\nIn the table, y=1 and y=2 both have (48,83,left,36), so yes.\n\nSo at T=30, if on y=2, collision.\n\nIn my sequence: T=28: y=0, action U\n\nT=29: y=1, action U\n\nT=30: y=2, but at T=30, y=2 has car covering 0, so collision.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=2 at T=30.\n\nTherefore, going straight up, I would be on y=2 at T=30 and collide.\n\nSo I need to avoid that.\n\nI could stay or go down at some point.\n\nSince the car is only unsafe at specific times, I might wait or move slower.\n\nNow, let's look at all freeways to see when each is unsafe.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, find the times when 0 is covered by any car on that row.\n\nStart with y=1: one car, left, s=36, h=48, τ=83 at T=28.\n\nSpan at T: [48 - 36ΔT, 83 - 36ΔT]\n\n0 in span iff 48 - 36ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 83 - 36ΔT\n\nAs before, ΔT ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so ΔT ≥ 2\n\nΔT ≤ 83/36 ≈2.305, so ΔT ≤ 2\n\nThus only at ΔT=2, T=30.\n\nSo y=1 unsafe only at T=30.\n\nSimilarly, y=2: same car, same parameters, so also unsafe only at T=30.\n\nNow y=3: multiple cars.\n\ny=3: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFirst, direction right, so for right-moving, span is [τ, h]? Let's see the update.\n\nFrom the rule: for right-moving, \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\"\n\nIn the table, it says (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, it says: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h]\" so head is right, tail is left, I think.\n\nIn the car state: for y=3, (48,37,right,12), but 48 and 37, if head h=48, tail τ=37, but for right-moving, span should be [τ, h] = [37,48] since moving right, increasing.\n\nLet's confirm with update.\n\nAt T, Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nFor the first car: h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12\n\nAt T=28, span [37,48]? But the table says (48,37,...), so head 48, tail 37, but since right-moving, span is from tail to head, [τ, h] = [37,48]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,12), so τ=1, h=12, span [1,12]\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12), τ=-35, h=-24, span [-35,-24]\n\nNow, for each, find when 0 in span.\n\nFirst car: [37 + 12ΔT, 48 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span: 37 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 12ΔT\n\nLeft: 37 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 => 12ΔT ≤ -37 => ΔT ≤ -37/12 ≈ -3.083, impossible since ΔT≥0.\n\nRight: 0 ≤ 48 + 12ΔT always true since 48+12ΔT ≥48>0.\n\nBut left inequality 37+12ΔT ≤0 is never true for ΔT≥0, so 0 never in [37+12ΔT,48+12ΔT] for ΔT≥0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: [1 + 12ΔT, 12 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in: 1+12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 12+12ΔT\n\nLeft: 1+12ΔT ≤0 => 12ΔT ≤ -1 => ΔT ≤ -1/12, impossible.\n\nRight: 0 ≤12+12ΔT always true.\n\nSo never.\n\nThird car: [-35 + 12ΔT, -24 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in: -35 +12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -24 +12ΔT\n\nFirst, 0 ≤ -24 +12ΔT => 12ΔT ≥24 => ΔT ≥ 2\n\nSecond, -35 +12ΔT ≤0 => 12ΔT ≤35 => ΔT ≤ 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so ΔT ≤ 2 since integer.\n\nΔT ≥2 and ΔT ≤2, so ΔT=2.\n\nAt ΔT=2, span [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0], so 0 in, yes.\n\nSo for y=3, third car covers 0 at ΔT=2, T=30.\n\nOther cars never cover 0.\n\nSo y=3 unsafe at T=30.\n\nNow y=4: same as y=3? In table, y=4 has same cars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nIdentical to y=3, so also unsafe only at T=30.\n\nSimilarly y=5: same, unsafe at T=30.\n\nNow y=6: different, only one car: (48,37,right,6)\n\nh=48, τ=37, d=right, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [37 + 6ΔT, 48 + 6ΔT]\n\n0 in: 37 +6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 48 +6ΔT\n\nLeft: 37+6ΔT ≤0 => 6ΔT ≤ -37 impossible.\n\nRight: 0 ≤48+6ΔT always true.\n\nSo never 0 in span. Thus y=6 always safe.\n\nIs that right? [37+6ΔT,48+6ΔT], at ΔT=0, [37,48], min 37>0, and increasing, so always >0, no 0, yes safe.\n\ny=7: same as y=6? y=7 has (48,37,right,6), same, so always safe.\n\nNow y=8: two cars: (48,37,right,6), and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6), same as above, never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6), so h=0, τ=-11? Let's see.\n\nHead h=0, tail τ=-11, direction right.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-11 + 6ΔT, 0 + 6ΔT] = [-11+6ΔT, 6ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -11+6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 6ΔT\n\nFirst, 0 ≤ 6ΔT always true for ΔT ≥0, but at ΔT=0, 0≤0 true.\n\nSecond, -11+6ΔT ≤ 0 => 6ΔT ≤11 => ΔT ≤ 11/6 ≈1.833, so ΔT ≤1 since integer.\n\nAlso, 0 ≤ 6ΔT, so for ΔT=0, 0≤0 true.\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=28, span [-11,0], so 0 in, since it includes 0.\n\nSimilarly, for ΔT=1, span [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nFor ΔT=2, span [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo 0 in span for ΔT=0 and ΔT=1, i.e., T=28 and T=29.\n\nNow, for y=8, at T=28, if someone is on y=8, collision possible.\n\nBut I start at T=28 on y=0, not on y=8.\n\nAt T=29, if on y=8, unsafe.\n\nAt T=30, ΔT=2, span [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nFor the first car on y=8, it never covers 0, as before.\n\nSo y=8 unsafe at T=28 and T=29, but safe at T=30 and after.\n\nT=28 and T=29 unsafe, T=30 safe.\n\nNow, summarize unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: unsafe at T=30 only\n\n- y=2: unsafe at T=30 only (same as y=1)\n\n- y=3: unsafe at T=30 only\n\n- y=4: unsafe at T=30 only\n\n- y=5: unsafe at T=30 only\n\n- y=6: always safe\n\n- y=7: always safe\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=28 and T=29, safe T=30 and after\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=28 and T=29.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9, passing through y=1 to y=8, but not necessarily all, and at each turn, when I'm on a y, it must be safe at that turn.\n\nSince I start at T=28, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal turns: if I can go directly, but with obstacles.\n\nSince y=6 and y=7 are always safe, I might go there quickly.\n\nBut I have to pass through the lower ones.\n\nThe main problem is T=30, where y=1 to y=5 are all unsafe.\n\nSpecifically, at T=30, y=1,2,3,4,5 are unsafe.\n\ny=6 and y=7 are safe, y=8 is safe at T=30.\n\ny=8 safe after T=29, i.e., T>=30 safe.\n\nNow, I need to not be on y=1 to 5 at T=30.\n\nAlso, for y=8, I cannot be on it at T=28 or T=29, but since I start at y=0 and need to go up, I won't be on y=8 that early.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nI need to reach y=9 in minimal H.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the actions from t=0 to H-1, so after H actions, I reach y=9.\n\nAt turn T, after action, I move to new y for next turn.\n\nDefine: at turn T, I am at position y_T, and I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nThen at turn T, I am on row y_T, and must be safe there.\n\nFor example, at T=28, I am at y=0, which is safe.\n\nI choose a_{28}, which sets y_{29}.\n\nThen at T=29, I am on y_{29}, must be safe, and so on.\n\nI need y_{t1 + H} = 9? Let's see.\n\nStart: turn t1=28, position (0, y_{28}) = (0,0)\n\nAfter H actions: actions at t=28 to t=28+H-1, so after last action, at turn t=28+H, position y_{28+H} =9.\n\nAnd for each turn from t=28 to t=28+H-1, when I am at that position, it must be safe, i.e., no collision at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, and it must be that for freeway y_T, no car covers 0 at turn T.\n\nThen at turn T, after action, I go to y_{T+1}, and at turn T+1, I am at y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nSo for the sequence, from T=28 to T=28+H-1, I am at y_T, must be safe.\n\nAnd y_{28+H} =9.\n\nNow y_{28} =0.\n\nThe actions determine the path.\n\nI need to find actions such that for each T from 28 to 28+H-1, y_T is safe, and y_{28+H} =9.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are always safe, as no freeway.\n\nNow, the unsafe times:\n\n- For y=1 to 5: unsafe only at T=30\n\n- y=6: always safe\n\n- y=7: always safe\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=28 and T=29, safe at T=30+\n\nT=30 is critical.\n\nAt T=30, y=1 to 5 are unsafe, so I must not be on y=1,2,3,4,5 at T=30.\n\nThat means at turn 30, I must be on y=0, or y=6,7,8, or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, probably not yet.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is start, I need to move up.\n\ny=6,7,8 are options.\n\nBut y=8 at T=30 is safe, as we said.\n\nNow, also, at T=29, for y=8, it is unsafe.\n\nLet me list the safe y for each T.\n\nFor T=28:\n\n- y=0: safe\n\n- y=1: safe? At T=28, y=1: from above, for y=1, unsafe only at T=30, so at T=28, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 to y=5: safe at T=28, since unsafe only at T=30.\n\ny=6: safe\n\ny=7: safe\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=28, so not safe.\n\ny=9: safe, but I'm not there.\n\nSo at T=28, safe y: all except y=8.\n\nBut I start at y=0.\n\nNow T=29:\n\ny=1: unsafe only at T=30, so safe at T=29\n\nSimilarly y=2,3,4,5 safe at T=29\n\ny=6 safe\n\ny=7 safe\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=29, so not safe\n\ny=0 safe, y=9 safe.\n\nSo safe at T=29: y=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9 but not y=8.\n\ny=9 is safe but not reachable yet.\n\nNow T=30:\n\ny=1,2,3,4,5: unsafe\n\ny=6: safe\n\ny=7: safe\n\ny=8: safe (since T=30>=30)\n\ny=0: safe\n\ny=9: safe\n\nSo safe at T=30: y=0,6,7,8,9\n\nNow T=31 and later: all y safe except that y=1 to 5 might have other unsafe times? From above, for y=1 to 5, only unsafe at T=30, and before and after safe? Let's check.\n\nFor example, y=1: we had only unsafe at T=30.\n\nAt T=31, ΔT=3, span [48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, other times no issue.\n\ny=3: only unsafe at T=30, other times safe.\n\ny=6,7 always safe.\n\ny=8: after T=29, safe.\n\nSo for T>=31, all y=1 to 8 are safe, since no other unsafe times.\n\ny=1 to 5 are safe except T=30, so for T=31, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at T=28 to y=9 at some T.\n\nMinimal H: since I need to increase y by 9, each U increases by 1, S or D don't, so minimal actions is 9 if I can go up directly, but with constraints.\n\nNow, at T=30, I must be on a safe y: 0,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=9 is goal, probably not yet, y=0 is behind.\n\nSo likely I need to be on y=6,7, or 8 at T=30.\n\ny=6 and 7 are always safe, so easy to be there.\n\nBut I start from y=0 at T=28.\n\nNow, let's see possible paths.\n\nFirst, I need to reach y=6 or higher by T=30, or stay low, but staying low might delay.\n\nSince at T=30 I must not be on y=1-5, and to go up, I need to pass through them, so I should be below or above at T=30.\n\nBelow: y=0, but from y=0, I need to go up later.\n\nAbove: y=6,7,8.\n\nNow, to reach y=6 from y=0 in 2 turns? T=28 to T=30.\n\nAt T=28, y=0.\n\nAfter action at T=28, y_{29} = y_{28} + Δy, so if I do U, y_{29}=1; D, y_{29}=0; S, y_{29}=0.\n\nThen at T=29, I am at y_{29}, choose action, set y_{30}.\n\nThen at T=30, I am at y_{30}.\n\nI need y_{30} to be safe at T=30, so y_{30} in {0,6,7,8,9}\n\nSimilarly, at T=29, I need y_{29} safe.\n\nNow, from y=0 at T=28, I can go to y=1 or stay at 0.\n\nIf I go to y=1 at T=29, then at T=29, y=1 is safe, as we said.\n\nThen from there, I need to set y_{30}.\n\nBut y=1 at T=30 is unsafe, so I cannot stay on y=1 or go to y=2, etc., because y_{30} must not be 1-5.\n\nSo if at T=29 I am at y=1, I can go to y=0,1,2 with actions D,S,U.\n\nBut if I go to y=2 at T=30, y=2 unsafe at T=30.\n\nIf I stay y=1, unsafe.\n\nIf go down to y=0, safe at T=30.\n\nBut then I am at y=0 at T=30, and need to go to 9, which takes more turns.\n\nSimilarly, if at T=29 I am at other y.\n\nTo be at y=6 or higher at T=30.\n\nBut y=6 is 6 steps up from y=0, in 2 turns? Impossible, since max increase is 2 in 2 turns (U,U).\n\ny_{30} can be at most y_{28} + 2 = 2, if U and U.\n\nWith U and U: at T=28, after U, y_{29}=1\n\nAt T=29, after U, y_{30}=2\n\ny_{30}=2, which is unsafe at T=30.\n\nIf I do U then S: y_{29}=1, y_{30}=1, unsafe.\n\nU then D: y_{29}=1, y_{30}=0, safe at T=30.\n\nBut y=0.\n\nThen I need to go up from there.\n\nIf I stay at T=28: S, then y_{29}=0\n\nThen at T=29, I can do U, to y_{30}=1, but y=1 unsafe at T=30.\n\nOr S, y_{30}=0, safe.\n\nOr D, but y=0, D to y=-1? No, y in [0,9], so D from 0 stays 0, I think.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy from action, but y bounded to [0,9], so if at 0 and D, it stays 0; at 9 and U, stays 9.\n\nSo from y=0, action D or S: y_{t+1}=0; U: y_{t+1}=1.\n\nSimilarly at 9.\n\nSo at T=28, if I do S or D, y_{29}=0\n\nThen at T=29, if I do U, y_{30}=1, unsafe.\n\nIf S or D, y_{30}=0, safe.\n\nBut then I am stuck at y=0.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo to avoid being on y=1-5 at T=30, I must be at y=0 or y=6+ at T=30, but I can't reach y=6 in 2 turns.\n\nTherefore, the only safe option at T=30 is to be at y=0.\n\nThen at T=30, y=0, safe.\n\nThen after that, I can go up.\n\nBut at T=30, y=0, I can start moving up.\n\nNow, for T>=31, all freeways are safe, as we established.\n\nSo I can go up directly to y=9.\n\nHow many turns from there.\n\nAt T=30, y=0.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9.\n\nEach U increases by 1, so 9 actions: at T=30, action U, to y=1 at T=31\n\n...\n\nAfter 9 U, at T=39, y=9.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nStart: T=28, y=0\n\nI need to be at y=0 at T=30.\n\nSo at T=28, I must not go up, because if I go up, y_{29}=1, then at T=29, if I go down, y_{30}=0.\n\nIf I stay at T=28, y_{29}=0, then at T=29, if I stay or down, y_{30}=0.\n\nBut to have y_{30}=0, I need to not move up in the first two actions.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nOption 1: at T=28, action S or D, so y_{29}=0\n\nThen at T=29, action S or D, so y_{30}=0\n\nThen at T=30, y=0, safe.\n\nThen from there, I can do U repeatedly to go up.\n\nBut at T=30, I am at y=0, action U, to y_{31}=1\n\nAt T=31, I am at y=1, which is safe now (since T=31>30), action U, to y_{32}=2, and so on, up to y_{39}=9.\n\nAfter actions: from T=30 to T=38, 9 actions: U each time.\n\nT=30: action U, to y_{31}=1\n\n...\n\nT=38: action U, to y_{39}=9\n\nSo at T=39, y=9.\n\nNow, total turns from start: actions from T=28 to T=38? Let's count.\n\nAt T=28, I do first action (say S or D), to y_{29}=0\n\nT=29, second action (S or D), to y_{30}=0\n\nT=30, third action U, to y_{31}=1\n\n...\n\nUp to T=38, action U, to y_{39}=9\n\nSo actions at T=28 to T=38, that's 11 actions? T=28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38: 11 turns.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, from t=0 to H-1, so 11 actions.\n\nBut I reached at T=39.\n\nSince I start at T=28, after H actions, at T=28+H, y=9.\n\nHere T=28+H =39, so H=11.\n\nBut perhaps I can start moving earlier.\n\nAt T=28, if I do nothing, but I have to wait until after T=30 to move up.\n\nAnother idea: can I be on y=8 at T=30?\n\ny=8 is safe at T=30.\n\nBut to reach y=8 by T=30.\n\nFrom y=0 at T=28, to y=8 at T=30.\n\ny_{30} = y_{28} + net change from actions at T=28 and T=29.\n\nEach action can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nSo max increase: +1 each, so y_{30} <= y_{28} +2 =2.\n\nCannot reach y=8.\n\nSimilarly, min decrease, but not useful.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=6 or higher at T=30.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is to be at y=0 at T=30.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nBut in this case, H=11, as above.\n\nBut perhaps I can go up partially before T=30.\n\nFor example, at T=28, I can go to y=1, since at T=29, y=1 is safe.\n\nThen at T=29, I need to go to a safe y for T=30, but from y=1, I can only go to y=0,1,2.\n\ny=0 safe, y=1 unsafe, y=2 unsafe.\n\nSo only to y=0.\n\nSo I go to y=1 at T=29, then to y=0 at T=30.\n\nThen from y=0 at T=30, same as before, go up.\n\nBut now, at T=28: U, to y_{29}=1\n\nT=29: D, to y_{30}=0? Action D from y=1, to y=0.\n\ny_{30}=0.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut I wasted actions: went up and down.\n\nIn terms of net y, I ended at y=0 at T=30, same as if I stayed, but used extra action? No.\n\nCompared to staying: if I stay at T=28 and T=29, y_{29}=0, y_{30}=0, with actions S or D.\n\nIf I go U then D: at T=28 U, to y_{29}=1; T=29 D, to y_{30}=0.\n\nSame y_{30}=0, but I used two actions to go and back, whereas staying used two actions to stay, same position.\n\nThen from T=30, I need 9 U to reach y=9 at T=39.\n\nTotal actions: from T=28 to T=38, 11 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, if I stay at 0 for two turns, then go up.\n\nI could go to other positions.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 and y=7 are always safe, I could go there before or after.\n\nBut to reach y=6, I need to go through y=1 to 5, which at T=30 are unsafe, but I can pass through at other times.\n\nFor example, I could go up to y=5 before T=30, but y=5 is safe except at T=30.\n\nAt T=29, y=5 is safe.\n\nThen at T=29, if I am at y=5, I need to go to a safe y for T=30.\n\nFrom y=5, I can go to y=4,5,6.\n\ny=4 and 5 unsafe at T=30, y=6 safe.\n\nSo I can go to y=6 at T=30.\n\nThen at T=30, on y=6, safe.\n\nThen from there, go to y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at T=29.\n\nAt T=29, y=5.\n\nNow, from y=0 at T=28, to y=5 at T=29.\n\ny_{29} = y_{28} + Δy from one action.\n\nAction at T=28 determines y_{29}.\n\ny_{29} can be 0 or 1, since from y=0, U to 1, S/D to 0.\n\nCannot reach y=5 in one action.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=4 at T=29, also impossible.\n\nMax I can be at T=29 is y=1.\n\nThen from y=1 at T=29, I can go to y=0,1,2; only y=0 is safe for T=30, as before.\n\nPerhaps I can reach higher y by T=31 or something.\n\nBut at T=30, I need to be safe.\n\nSince I must be at y=0 at T=30, and then go up.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can be on y=6 at T=30.\n\nBut as above, impossible from start.\n\nUnless I move faster, but I can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11, with sequence: stay or down for first two actions to be at y=0 at T=30, then up up up... to 9.\n\nBut in terms of actions, I need to specify.\n\nBut H=11.\n\nBut perhaps I can start going up after T=30 immediately.\n\nBut with the constraint, yes.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach earlier by not waiting.\n\nAnother thought: at T=29, I can be on y=7 or something, but impossible.\n\ny=8 at T=30 is safe, but can't reach.\n\nUnless I was higher earlier, but I start low.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to avoid, but not useful.\n\nSo I think H=11 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's see the answer format; I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, for the first two actions, I can do S or D, same effect from y=0.\n\nSimilarly, at the end, when going up, I need to go to y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is not freeway, so safe.\n\nNow, in the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nt_1=28.\n\nH=11, so actions at t=28 to 38.\n\nThen position at t=39 is (0,9).\n\nNow, for the first two, to stay at 0, I can do S or D.\n\nSimilarly, when going up, all U.\n\nBut to minimize time, but since I have to wait, no choice.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=1 at T=29, which is safe, then at T=29 go down to y=0 for T=30, but that's the same as staying, and I used D which might not be necessary, but in terms of number of turns, same.\n\nIn the sequence, if I do U then D, it's two actions, same as S S.\n\nThen same.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nFirst, I need to have y_{30}=0.\n\nThen from T=30 to T=38, actions U to go from 0 to 9.\n\nAt T=30, y=0, action U, to y_{31}=1\n\nAt T=31, y=1, action U, to y_{32}=2\n\n...\n\nAt T=38, y=8, action U, to y_{39}=9\n\nNow, before that, at T=28 and T=29, I need to be at y=0 at T=30.\n\nSo at T=28, action: since y=0, if I do S or D, y_{29}=0\n\nThen at T=29, action S or D, y_{30}=0\n\nSo for example, I can do S at both.\n\nOr D at both, or S and D, etc., same.\n\nNow, in the sequence, actions from t_1=28 to t_1+H-1=28+11-1=38? H=11, actions t=28 to 38, that's 11 actions.\n\nt from 28 to 38 inclusive is 11 turns.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nTurn 28: S (or D)\n\nTurn 29: S (or D)\n\nThen Turn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nThen at turn 39, y=9.\n\nBut turn 38 action U to y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions up to turn 38.\n\nNow, but I think H=11 is minimal, but let's see if I can do better.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=6 at some point.\n\nFor example, after T=30, I can go up fast.\n\nBut from T=30 at y=0, it takes 9 turns to go to 9, no less.\n\nUnless I can be higher than 0 at T=30, but I can't.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 and y=7 are safe, and I can go directly to them after T=30.\n\nBut from y=0, I need to pass through lower y, but after T=30, all safe, so I can go through quickly.\n\nBut in the path above, I do go through all.\n\nPerhaps I can skip some by going faster, but I can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe times again.\n\nFor y=8, it was unsafe at T=28 and T=29, but since I am not there, no issue.\n\nIn the go-up phase, when I reach y=8, it will be after T=30, so safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up to y=1 at T=29, then at T=29 go down to y=0 for T=30, but that's same as staying.\n\nNo gain.\n\nAt T=29, if I could go to y=6, but impossible.\n\nSo I think H=11 is the answer.\n\nBut in the sequence, for the first two actions, I should specify.\n\nSince S or D same, I can use S.\n\nNow, about y=8: at T=28 and T=29, unsafe, but I am not on it.\n\nIn the go-up, when I am on y=8, say at T=38, y=8, then action U to y=9.\n\nAt T=38, y=8, is it safe? T=38, which is after T=30, so y=8 is safe, as we said.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 faster by being at a higher y at T=30, but impossible.\n\nSo minimal H=11.\n\nNow, in the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 28: S\n\nTurn 29: S\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nAfter Turn 38 action, at turn 39, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: 11.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose I reach y=9 at turn 38.\n\nThen y_{38}=9.\n\nThat means at turn 37, y=8 or 9, and action to 9.\n\nBut y_{38}=9 must be at turn 38.\n\nTurn t, position y_t.\n\nAt turn 38, y_{38}=9.\n\nThen at turn 37, after action, y_{38} = y_{37} + Δy, so if y_{37}=8, U to 9; or y_{37}=9, S to 9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo have y_{38}=9, I need to be at 8 or 9 at turn 37.\n\nBut turn 37 is after T=30, so safe.\n\nBut from start, at turn 28, y=0.\n\nTo reach y=8 or 9 by turn 37.\n\nTurn 37 is 9 turns after turn 28? From turn 28 to turn 37, that's 9 steps? Turns: turn 28 to 29 is one action, position changes.\n\nNumber of actions from turn 28 to turn 37: actions at t=28,29,30,...,37: that's 10 actions? t=28 to 37 inclusive: 37-28+1=10 actions.\n\nThen after 10 actions, at turn 38, y_{38}.\n\nIf I can set y_{38}=9, then H=10.\n\nBut with 10 actions, net increase must be 9, so I need exactly 9 U and 1 other, but if I do 9 U and one S or D, net increase less than 9, cannot reach y=9 from y=0.\n\nFor example, 9 U and one S: net +9, but I need 10 actions: if I do 9 U and one S, at some point.\n\nStart y=0.\n\nAfter 10 actions, if I have 9 U and 1 S, net +9, y=9.\n\nSimilarly, 9 U and 1 D, net +8, y=8, not 9.\n\nSo only with 9 U and one S, or all 10 U, but 10 U would be y=10, not possible, since y=9 max.\n\ny bounded to 9, so if at y=9, U stays 9.\n\nSo to reach y=9 with minimal actions, I need exactly 9 U, and possibly S or D, but S or D don't increase, so with extra S or D, it takes more turns.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=0, minimal actions is 9, all U.\n\nBut in this case, with constraints, I couldn't do that because of T=30.\n\nWith H=10, I can have 9 U and one S, for example.\n\nBut y=9 at turn 28+10=38.\n\nNow, can I achieve that with the constraint?\n\nI need to avoid being on y=1-5 at T=30.\n\nT=30 is turn 30.\n\nNow, with 10 actions from turn 28 to 37.\n\nI need to include one S or D to not progress too fast or something.\n\nBut let's see the position at T=30.\n\nTurn T=30, I am at y_{30}.\n\ny_{30} must be safe, i.e., not 1-5, so 0,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut from y=0, in two actions (turn 28 and 29), I can be at y=0,1,2.\n\nAs before.\n\ny=30 must be 0,1,2 but 1 and 2 unsafe, so only y=0 possible at T=30.\n\nThen from there, I need to reach y=9 by turn 38.\n\nFrom turn 30, y=0, to turn 38, y=9? After actions from turn 30 to turn 37, that's 8 actions.\n\nWith 8 actions, max y=8 if all U, or y=9 if I start from higher, but I start from y=0.\n\ny_{30}=0.\n\nThen actions at turn 30 to 37: 8 actions.\n\nIf all U, y_{31}=1, y_{32}=2, ..., y_{38}=8.\n\nThen at turn 38, y=8, not 9.\n\nThen I need another action to U to y=9 at turn 39.\n\nWith 8 actions from y=0, I reach y=8.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need 9 actions from y=0.\n\nTherefore, from y=0 at turn 30, I need 9 actions to reach y=9 at turn 39.\n\nThus, with the delay at start, H=11 is minimal.\n\nIf I could be at y=1 at turn 30, but y=1 unsafe, impossible.\n\nSo no, H=11 is the minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence as above.\n\nNow, in the sequence, for the first two, I used S, but I can use D, same.\n\nIn the output, I should specify the actions.\n\nNow, about the cars on y=6,7, but since I go through after T=30, safe.\n\nIn the sequence, when I go up, I might be on y=1 at turn 31, which is safe, etc.\n\nAll fine.\n\nSo the minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, write the answer.\n\nTurn 28: S\n\nTurn 29: S\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's make sure the turn numbering.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1=28.\n\nSequence for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=11, so t=28 to 38.\n\nActions as above.\n\nI could use D for the first two, but S is fine.\n\nIn the car state, for y=8, there was a car at T=28 and 29, but not relevant for this path.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 28\\) is 11. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a freeway row when a car covers position 0 at that turn.\n\n### Key Constraints and Reasoning:\n- At turn \\(T = 30\\) (i.e., \\(\\Delta T = 2\\)), freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\) are unsafe due to cars covering position 0. Thus, the player must not be on these rows at \\(T = 30\\).\n- Freeways \\(y = 6\\) and \\(y = 7\\) are always safe, but reaching them by \\(T = 30\\) from \\(y = 0\\) is impossible in two turns (maximum increase is to \\(y = 2\\)).\n- Freeway \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe at \\(T = 28\\) and \\(T = 29\\), but safe from \\(T = 30\\) onward. However, reaching \\(y = 8\\) by \\(T = 30\\) is also impossible.\n- The only safe position at \\(T = 30\\) is \\(y = 0\\) (or \\(y = 6, 7, 8, 9\\), but \\(y \\geq 6\\) is unreachable by \\(T = 30\\)).\n- Therefore, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at \\(T = 30\\) to avoid collision. This requires staying at \\(y = 0\\) for turns \\(T = 28\\) and \\(T = 29\\) using actions \\(S\\) (stay) or \\(D\\) (down). Action \\(S\\) is chosen for simplicity.\n- For \\(T \\geq 31\\), all freeways are safe, so the player can move directly upward with \\(U\\) actions to reach \\(y = 9\\) in 9 turns.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 28**: Action \\(S\\) (stay) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 29. (Safe, as \\(y = 0\\) has no freeway.)\n- **Turn 29**: Action \\(S\\) (stay) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 30. (Safe, as \\(y = 0\\) has no freeway.)\n- **Turn 30**: Action \\(U\\) (up) to move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 31. (Safe, as \\(y = 0\\) at \\(T = 30\\).)\n- **Turn 31**: Action \\(U\\) to move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 32. (Safe, as \\(T = 31 > 30\\) and all freeways safe.)\n- **Turn 32**: Action \\(U\\) to move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 33. (Safe.)\n- **Turn 33**: Action \\(U\\) to move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 34. (Safe.)\n- **Turn 34**: Action \\(U\\) to move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 35. (Safe.)\n- **Turn 35**: Action \\(U\\) to move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 36. (Safe.)\n- **Turn 36**: Action \\(U\\) to move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 37. (Safe.)\n- **Turn 37**: Action \\(U\\) to move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 38. (Safe, as \\(T = 37 > 30\\) and \\(y = 8\\) safe.)\n- **Turn 38**: Action \\(U\\) to move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 39. (Safe, as \\(y = 9\\) has no freeway.)\n\nAfter the action at turn 38, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 39. The sequence uses 11 actions (turns 28 to 38), achieving the minimal \\(H = 11\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 28: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 30: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: \\, U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are starting at turn 30 at position (0,0) and we wish to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with any car on the freeways we are on at the time of the turn.\n\nImportant note: \n- At turn T, we are on freeway y_T. \n- Collision occurs at turn T only if for the freeway y_T, there is a car whose span at turn T includes 0 (the horizontal position of the player is always 0? Actually, the player is at (0, y_T) and the cars are on the same freeway (same y) and we check if the car's span at turn T covers the x=0? But note: the car update is given in terms of the horizontal axis. The problem states: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAlso note: when we move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, we are not on freeway y_{T+1} at turn T, so we only worry about the freeway we are currently on (y_T) at turn T.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t_1 (which is 30). We have to compute the car spans at future turns.\n\nPlan:\nWe are to find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves us from y=0 to y=9 in minimal H (number of turns) without being hit by a car on the freeway we are on at each turn.\n\nWe start at turn 30 at y=0. We note that at turn T (>=30), the car on freeway k (for k in 1..8) has a span that changes linearly with time.\n\nFor each car, we are given (head, tail, direction, speed) at turn 30.\n\nBut note: the representation for left-moving and right-moving is different:\n\nLeft-moving: \n  At turn 30: span = [h, τ] (with h > τ? Actually, the example: (48,83,left,36) -> this seems odd because 48<83? Let me read the update:\n\nFor left-moving: \n  Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut if the car is moving left, then the head (which is the front) should be the leftmost? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: \"head is at h, tail is at τ\", and then the span is [h, τ]. However, if the car is moving left, then as time passes, both h and τ decrease. But note: if h is the head and the car is moving left, then the head is the rightmost part? Actually, the problem does not specify which is the front. But the update rule is symmetric.\n\nBut looking at the data: \n  For freeway 1: (48,83,left,36) -> if head is 48 and tail is 83, and it's moving left, then at turn 30 the car covers from 48 to 83? But that would be a segment of length 35, and moving left means that both endpoints decrease. But then at T=30, the car is from 48 to 83? Then 83 is the tail? and since it's moving left, the tail at 83 is the rightmost? Actually, it's ambiguous. However, the update rule is clear: the entire segment shifts left by s per turn.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \n  Span(t1)=[τ, h] -> becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for a right-moving car, the initial span is given as [τ, h] meaning from τ to h (with τ < h) and then it moves right.\n\nBut in the data for freeway 3: \n  (48,37,right,12) -> if it's right-moving, then the span at turn30 is given as [τ, h] = [37,48]? But the data says (48,37,right,12). So the first number is head, second is tail? Then for right-moving, they write (head, tail) and then the span is [tail, head]? Because the problem says: \"For car k ... head at h, tail at τ\" and then for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\".\n\nSo to clarify:\n\nFor a right-moving car: \n  head = h, tail = τ, and we assume h > τ? because the span is [τ, h] and then moves right.\n\nBut in the data: (48,37,right,12): then head=48, tail=37 -> so the car spans from 37 to 48 (so τ=37, h=48) and moves right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: (48,83,left,36): head=48, tail=83 -> so the car spans from 48 to 83? Then as it moves left, both endpoints decrease. But note: 48 is the head and 83 is the tail? Then the head is the leftmost? because when moving left the head goes first? Actually, the problem doesn't specify the orientation. We just have to use the update rule.\n\nSo for a left-moving car: \n  At turn T: the span is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: if at turn30, the car is from 48 to 83, then the head is 48 (the left end) and the tail is 83 (the right end). Then as it moves left, the entire segment shifts left.\n\nBut wait: if the car is moving left, then the head (which is the front) should be the leftmost? Then yes, so the head is the left end.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: head is the rightmost? Actually, no: for right-moving, the head is the front which is the rightmost? Then the tail is the leftmost. So the span for right-moving is [tail, head] = [leftmost, rightmost] and then moves right.\n\nSo in summary, for a car at turn30 (t1=30):\n- Left-moving: the car covers [h, τ] (with h <= τ? Actually in the example: h=48, τ=83 -> so h<τ) and then at time T, it covers [h - s*(T-30), τ - s*(T-30)].\n- Right-moving: the car covers [τ, h] (so τ is the left end, h is the right end) and then at time T, it covers [τ + s*(T-30), h + s*(T-30)].\n\nBut wait, in the left-moving example: (48,83,left,36): \n  At T=30: [48, 83]\n  At T=31: [48-36=12, 83-36=47] -> [12,47]\n\nFor right-moving: (48,37,right,12) at T=30: [37,48] (because [τ, h] = [37,48])\n  At T=31: [37+12=49, 48+12=60] -> [49,60]\n\nNow, the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k, then we check if there is any car on freeway k at turn T such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nWe start at turn30 at y=0. Note: freeway y=0 is not listed, so no car at y=0? Actually, the freeways with cars are y=1..8. So at y=0, we are safe at turn30.\n\nOur goal is to get to y=9. Similarly, freeway y=9 is not listed, so we don't have to worry about cars at y=9? Actually, the problem says: freeways y=1,...,8. So at y=0 and y=9, there are no cars. So we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nTherefore, we start at y=0 (safe) and we wish to end at y=9 (safe). The danger is in the freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe can only move one step at a time: U (up: y increases by 1), D (down: y decreases by 1), S (stay: y same). But note: we are at y=0, so we cannot go down (y would become -1, but the rule says y_{t+1} in [0,9]). So at y=0, we can only do U or S.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, we can only do D or S.\n\nWe need to minimize the number of turns H.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting from turn30 (a_{30}) until we reach y=9.\n\nWe have to avoid being on a freeway k (for k=1..8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway at T that covers x=0.\n\nWe are given the car configurations at turn30 for each freeway. Note: each freeway can have multiple cars.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k, and for each car on k, the span at any future turn T.\n\nThen, for a candidate sequence of actions, we can compute the player's y at each turn T (starting at T=30: y=0) and then check for each T from 30 until the last turn (before we reach y=9) whether we are on a freeway k (which is between 1 and 8) and if at that turn T, any car on k has a span that includes 0.\n\nWe want the minimal H. Since we can only move one step per turn, the minimal H would be at least 9 (if we go up every turn: 0->1->2->...->9, that's 9 moves, but we start at turn30 and we do 9 moves: then at turn39 we are at y=9? Actually, we start at turn30 at y=0, and we do H-1 actions? The problem says: sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1, and then at the end of the sequence (after H actions) we have y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\nWait: \n  t1 = 30.\n  t = 0: a_{30} -> then at the end of turn30, we have y_{31} = y_30 + Delta y_30.\n  Actually, the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo at turn30: we are at y_30 = 0.\nThen we choose a_30 -> then at turn31, we are at y_31 = y_30 + Delta(a_30).\n\nWe do H actions: from a_{30} to a_{30+H-1}. Then after H actions, we have y_{30+H} = 9? \n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1, so we do H actions. Then the position at the next state (after the last action) is y_{t1+H} = y_{30+H}. And we require that to be 9.\n\nSo we start at turn30 at y=0, and after H actions (at turn30+H) we are at y=9.\n\nThe minimal H is 9: if we do U every time: \n  Turn30: U -> y31=1\n  Turn31: U -> y32=2\n  ...\n  Turn38: U -> y39=9\n\nSo H=9 actions? Then we have 9 actions: from a30 to a38, and then at turn39 we are at y=9.\n\nBut we must check if we are safe at every turn from 30 to 38? Actually, at each turn T (from 30 to 38) we are at y_T, and then we choose an action that leads to y_{T+1}. The collision condition is at turn T: we are at y_T. So we must check for T from 30 to 38? But note: at turn30, we are at y=0 (safe). Then we choose a30 -> then at turn31, we are at y31. Then at turn31, we are at y31 and we must check if that freeway (if between 1 and 8) has a car at turn31 that covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, at turn32, we are at y32, and so on until turn38: we are at y38? Then at turn39 we are at y9 (safe) and we don't check turn39? Because the problem only requires avoiding collisions during the journey? And at turn39 we have reached.\n\nSo we need to check turns 30 to 38? Actually, we are at turn30: safe (y=0). Then we take action a30 and then at turn31 we are at y31. At turn31, we are on freeway y31 and we must check for collision at turn31. Similarly, we must check at every turn from 31 to 38 (because at turn39 we are at y9, which is safe).\n\nSo we have to check T = 31,32,...,38.\n\nBut note: we start at turn30 at y=0 (safe) and then we do an action at turn30 which leads to y31. Then at turn31 we are at y31 and we check. Then we do an action at turn31 which leads to y32, and so on.\n\nTherefore, we have 8 intermediate freeway positions (from y31 to y38) that we must check for collisions.\n\nNow, the minimal H is 9 (if we can go straight up without being hit on any freeway from 1 to 8 at the corresponding turns).\n\nBut let's check the cars.\n\nWe have to check for each freeway k and for each car on k whether at a given turn T (>=30) the car's span includes 0.\n\nWe'll precompute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each car on k, the time intervals (if any) when the car covers 0.\n\nBut note: the cars move continuously? Actually, they move in discrete steps per turn? The update is linear per turn. So at integer turns, the car's span is a continuous interval? Actually, the problem doesn't specify the type of the coordinates, but the update is linear with integer speed, so the endpoints are integers? The given data are integers.\n\nSo we can compute for each car the set of turns when 0 is in its span.\n\nBut note: the car spans are intervals that move at constant speed. So we can compute the time interval [t_start, t_end] (if any) during which 0 is covered by the car.\n\nAlternatively, for a given car and a given turn T, we can compute the span and check if 0 is in it.\n\nWe have to do this for T from 31 to 38 (if we take the direct path) but we might take more than 9 turns? So we need to consider a range of T.\n\nBut first, let's try the direct path (H=9) and see if it is safe.\n\nDirect path: \n  Turn30: U -> y31=1\n  Turn31: U -> y32=2\n  Turn32: U -> y33=3\n  Turn33: U -> y34=4\n  Turn34: U -> y35=5\n  Turn35: U -> y36=6\n  Turn36: U -> y37=7\n  Turn37: U -> y38=8\n  Turn38: U -> y39=9 -> safe.\n\nNow, we check for each T from 31 to 38 (freeway y_T = T-30? because we start at turn31 at y=1, turn32 at y=2, etc.)\n\nWait: \n  At turn31: y=1 -> freeway1\n  turn32: y=2 -> freeway2\n  turn33: y=3 -> freeway3\n  turn34: y=4 -> freeway4\n  turn35: y=5 -> freeway5\n  turn36: y=6 -> freeway6\n  turn37: y=7 -> freeway7\n  turn38: y=8 -> freeway8\n\nSo we need to check freeway1 at turn31, freeway2 at turn32, etc.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway k and at turn T = 30 + (k) (because at turn30+k, we are at y=k) we check the cars.\n\nBut note: the turn when we are on freeway k is T = 30 + k? Because we start at turn30 at y=0, then after one move (at turn31) we are at y=1, so for freeway k, we are at turn T = 30 + k.\n\nSo for freeway1: T=31\nfreeway2: T=32\n...\nfreeway8: T=38\n\nNow, we check each freeway at that specific turn.\n\nFreeway 1: at T=31\n  Cars: (48,83,left,36)\n  For left-moving car: \n      T=31: span = [h - s*(31-30), τ - s*(31-30)] = [48-36*1, 83-36*1] = [12, 47]\n  Does 0 lie in [12,47]? No.\n\nFreeway 2: at T=32\n  Cars: same as freeway1: (48,83,left,36)\n      T=32: [48-36*2, 83-36*2] = [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11]\n  Now, 0 is in [-24,11]? Yes, because -24<=0<=11.\n\nSo at turn32 (freeway2) we would be hit by the car.\n\nTherefore, the direct path is not safe at turn32 (freeway2).\n\nWe must avoid freeway2 at turn32.\n\nSo we cannot take the direct path.\n\nWe need to either wait at some freeway or go down? But note we are going upward.\n\nWe might have to wait at y=0 for some turns? Or at some safe freeway? Or take a detour? But we can only move one step at a time.\n\nWe need to find a path that avoids being on a freeway at a turn when there is a car covering 0.\n\nWe can model the state as (turn, y) and we wish to go from (30,0) to any (turn,9) with minimal turns (so minimal H, which is the number of actions, and then the turn at the end is 30+H).\n\nWe are constrained by the grid: y in [0,9] and the moves U, D, S.\n\nWe must avoid states (T, y) for y in [1,8] such that at turn T, there is a car on freeway y that covers 0.\n\nWe are given the car configurations at turn30, and we can compute the car spans at any future turn T.\n\nWe'll precompute for each freeway y (1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, the set of turns T (>=30) for which 0 is in the car's span.\n\nBut note: the car spans are intervals that move linearly. For each car, we can solve:\n\nFor a left-moving car: \n  We require: h - s*(T-30) <= 0 <= τ - s*(T-30)\n  => h - s*(T-30) <= 0 and 0 <= τ - s*(T-30)\n  => T-30 >= h/s   and T-30 <= τ/s   [if s>0]\n\nBut note: h and τ are integers, s is integer, T is integer.\n\nActually:\n  h - s*(T-30) <= 0  => s*(T-30) >= h  => T-30 >= ceil(h/s)   [if s>0, and h>0?]\n  and \n  0 <= τ - s*(T-30) => s*(T-30) <= τ  => T-30 <= floor(τ/s)\n\nSo the car blocks freeway y at turns T such that:\n  T in [30 + ceil(h/s), 30 + floor(τ/s)]\n\nBut note: if h is negative? Actually, at turn30, h and τ are given. For freeway1: h=48, τ=83, s=36. Then:\n  T-30 >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(1.333) = 2? -> so T>=32\n  T-30 <= floor(83/36) = floor(2.305) = 2\n\nSo only at T=32? Indeed, at T=31: [12,47] -> 0 not in, at T=32: [-24,11] -> 0 in, at T=33: [-60,-25] -> 0 not in.\n\nBut wait: at T=32: [48-72, 83-72] = [-24,11] -> yes, 0 in [-24,11]. At T=31: [12,47] -> 0 not in. At T=30: [48,83] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway1: the car blocks only at T=32? Actually, no: the condition: \n  h - s*(T-30) <= 0 and 0 <= τ - s*(T-30)\n  => T-30 >= 48/36 = 1.333 -> so T-30>=2 (since integer, T>=32)\n      and T-30 <= 83/36 = 2.305 -> so T-30<=2 -> T<=32.\n\nSo only T=32.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway2: same car? So same condition? Yes, because the car on freeway2 is identical to freeway1: (48,83,left,36). So it also blocks only at T=32.\n\nNow, freeway3: has three cars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nWe check each:\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) -> note: for right-moving, the initial span is [τ, h] = [37,48] (since tail=37, head=48). Then at T: [37+12*(T-30), 48+12*(T-30)]\n\nCheck if 0 in [37+12*(T-30), 48+12*(T-30)]?\n  This interval is always above 37 (at T=30: [37,48]), so 0 is never in it.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12) -> initial span [1,12] (because tail=1, head=12). Then at T: [1+12*(T-30), 12+12*(T-30)]\n\nCheck 0 in [1+12*(T-30), 12+12*(T-30)]?\n  We require: 1+12*(T-30) <= 0 <= 12+12*(T-30)\n  Left: 1+12*(T-30) <=0 -> 12*(T-30)<=-1 -> T-30<=-1/12 -> T-30<=-1 (since T-30 integer) -> T<=29 -> not possible (since T>=30). So never.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12) -> initial span [τ, h] = [-35,-24] (tail=-35, head=-24). Then at T: [-35+12*(T-30), -24+12*(T-30)]\n\nCheck 0 in [-35+12*(T-30), -24+12*(T-30)]?\n  => -35+12*(T-30) <= 0 <= -24+12*(T-30)\n  First inequality: -35+12*(T-30) <=0 -> 12*(T-30)<=35 -> T-30<=35/12≈2.916 -> T<=32.916 -> so T<=32 (since integer)\n  Second inequality: 0<=-24+12*(T-30) -> 12*(T-30)>=24 -> T-30>=2 -> T>=32.\n\nSo only T=32: \n  T=32: [-35+12*2, -24+12*2] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Actually, the interval is [-11,0] and 0 is the right endpoint? Is 0 included? Yes, because the span is inclusive? The problem says \"if 0 ∈ Span(T)\".\n\nSo at T=32, 0 is in [-11,0]. \n\nTherefore, freeway3 is blocked at T=32.\n\nBut note: we are going to check freeway3 at turn33? Because in the direct path we are at freeway3 at turn33? Actually, no: in the direct path, we are at freeway3 at turn33? \n\nRecall: \n  At turn31: y=1 -> freeway1\n  turn32: y=2 -> freeway2\n  turn33: y=3 -> freeway3\n\nSo for freeway3, we check at turn33? \n\nBut the car on freeway3 blocks at T=32? At turn32, if we were on freeway3, then we would be hit. But in the direct path we are on freeway3 at turn33.\n\nSo let's check freeway3 at turn33 for the third car: \n  T=33: [-35+12*3, -24+12*3] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo the third car does not block at turn33.\n\nBut freeway3 has three cars. The first two never block 0. The third blocks only at T=32. So freeway3 is safe at turn33.\n\nBut wait, we must check all cars at turn33? \n  First car: [37+12*(3)=37+36=73, 48+36=84] -> [73,84] -> no.\n  Second car: [1+12*3=37, 12+36=48] -> [37,48] -> no.\n  Third car: [1,12] as above -> no.\n\nSo freeway3 at turn33 is safe.\n\nBut in the direct path, we are blocked at freeway2 at turn32.\n\nNow, freeway4: same cars as freeway3? \n  | 4 | (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) |\n\nSo same as freeway3. Therefore, the third car blocks at T=32, but at T=34 (if we are at freeway4 at turn34) we check the cars at turn34.\n\nFor the third car at turn34: \n  [-35+12*4, -24+12*4] = [-35+48, -24+48] = [13,24] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway4 at turn34 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5: same as freeway3 and 4? Yes. Then at turn35: \n  Third car: [-35+12*5, -24+12*5] = [-35+60, -24+60] = [25,36] -> safe.\n\nFreeway6: only one car: (48,37,right,6)\n  For right-moving: initial span [37,48]. Then at T: [37+6*(T-30), 48+6*(T-30)]\n\n  Check if 0 in [37+6*(T-30), 48+6*(T-30)]? \n    Always positive? At T=30: [37,48], so never.\n\nFreeway7: same as freeway6: one car (48,37,right,6) -> same, never blocks 0.\n\nFreeway8: two cars: (48,37,right,6), (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: same as above, never blocks 0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6) -> note: head=0, tail=-11? Then for right-moving, the initial span is [τ, h] = [-11,0]. Then at T: [-11+6*(T-30), 0+6*(T-30)]\n\nCheck if 0 in this interval?\n  We require: -11+6*(T-30) <= 0 <= 6*(T-30)\n  Second inequality: 0<=6*(T-30) -> T>=30 -> always true for T>=30.\n  First inequality: -11+6*(T-30) <=0 -> 6*(T-30)<=11 -> T-30<=11/6≈1.833 -> T<=31.833 -> so T<=31.\n\nSo the second car blocks at T=30 and T=31? \n  T=30: [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Yes.\n  T=31: [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6]? Yes.\n  T=32: [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway8 is blocked at T=30 and T=31.\n\nBut in the direct path, we are at freeway8 at turn38? \n  We are at freeway8 at turn38: so we check the cars at turn38.\n\nAt turn38: \n  First car: [37+6*(38-30)=37+48=85, 48+48=96] -> [85,96] -> no.\n  Second car: [-11+6*8, 0+48] = [-11+48, 48] = [37,48] -> no.\n\nSo freeway8 at turn38 is safe.\n\nSummary for direct path: \n  Only problem at freeway2 at turn32.\n\nWe must avoid being at freeway2 at turn32.\n\nWe can try to delay going to freeway2 until after turn32? But we are at freeway1 at turn31. Then at turn31 we could wait (S) at freeway1? Then at turn32 we would still be at freeway1. Then at turn32 we move to freeway2? But then at turn32 we are at freeway2? And we know freeway2 at turn32 is blocked.\n\nAlternatively, we could at turn31 wait (S) at freeway1 for one turn? Then:\n  Turn30: U -> y31=1 (freeway1 at turn31: safe? we need to check freeway1 at turn31 and turn32? because we are there at turn31 and then at turn32 we are still there if we stay)\n\nBut we must check freeway1 at the turns we are there.\n\nFreeway1: \n  Car: (48,83,left,36)\n  At turn31: [12,47] -> safe (0 not in)\n  At turn32: [-24,11] -> unsafe (0 in [-24,11])\n\nSo if we stay at freeway1 at turn31 and then at turn32 we are still at freeway1, then at turn32 we are hit.\n\nSo we cannot stay at freeway1 at turn32.\n\nAnother idea: after freeway1, we go down? But that would be counterproductive. Or we might wait at y=0 for some turns.\n\nLet me try:\n\nWe start at turn30: at y=0 (safe). We can do S (stay at y=0) for one or more turns.\n\nThen we start moving.\n\nBut note: we must reach y=9. The minimal H is 9, but if we wait, H will be more.\n\nBut we have to avoid freeway2 at turn32.\n\nWe can try to be at freeway2 at a different turn.\n\nFor freeway2, we know it is blocked only at turn32? Because the car blocks only at T=32.\n\nSo if we are at freeway2 at any turn other than 32, it is safe? \n\nCheck freeway2 at other turns:\n  The car: (48,83,left,36)\n  T=30: [48,83] -> safe.\n  T=31: [12,47] -> safe.\n  T=32: [-24,11] -> unsafe.\n  T=33: [48-36*3,83-108] = [48-108,83-108] = [-60,-25] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway2 is safe at T=30,31,33 and beyond.\n\nWe cannot be at freeway2 at T=32.\n\nIn the direct path, we are at freeway2 at T=32 (turn32). We want to avoid that.\n\nSo we can either:\n  Option 1: Be at freeway2 earlier: at turn31? But at turn31 we are at freeway1. To be at freeway2 at turn31, we would have had to be at freeway1 at turn30? But we start at turn30 at y=0. Then at turn30 we move to freeway1? Then at turn31 we move to freeway2? But then at turn31 we are at freeway2? And freeway2 at turn31 is safe? Yes. Then we are at freeway2 at turn31. Then at turn32 we can move to freeway3? Then we avoid freeway2 at turn32.\n\nBut let's see:\n\n  Turn30: U -> y31=1 (freeway1 at turn31? Actually, at turn30 we are at y=0. After action at turn30, at turn31 we are at y=1. Then at turn31 we are at freeway1? But we want to be at freeway2 at turn31? How? We start at y0 at turn30. Then after one action (U) we are at y1 at turn31. Then to be at y2 at turn31? We cannot: at each turn we move at most one step.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at freeway2 at turn31 because at turn31 we can only be at y1 (if we moved up from y0) or still at y0 (if we stayed).\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway2 at turn31.\n\nOption 2: Be at freeway2 later: at turn33? \n\nBut to be at freeway2 at turn33, we must be at freeway1 at turn32? Then at turn32 we move to freeway2? Then at turn33 we are at freeway2? \n\nBut we have to get to freeway2 at turn33? Then we would be at freeway1 at turn32? But freeway1 at turn32 is unsafe (as we saw: [-24,11] includes 0). \n\nSo we cannot be at freeway1 at turn32 either.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid both freeway1 and freeway2 at turn32? \n\nBut we have to go through freeway1 and freeway2.\n\nWe might have to wait at y=0 for a few turns until after turn32? Then we can go up safely.\n\nLet me try:\n\nStart at turn30: at y0 (safe). We do S (stay) for two turns? Then at turn32 we are still at y0? Then we start moving up.\n\nBut then:\n\n  Turn30: S -> y31=0 (safe)\n  Turn31: S -> y32=0 (safe)\n  Turn32: U -> y33=1 (freeway1 at turn33: we need to check freeway1 at turn33)\n\nFor freeway1 at turn33: \n  Car: [48-36*3, 83-36*3] = [48-108,83-108] = [-60,-25] -> safe.\n\nThen:\n  Turn33: U -> y34=2 (freeway2 at turn34: check freeway2 at turn34: [48-36*4,83-36*4] = [48-144,83-144] = [-96,-61] -> safe.\n\nThen we continue:\n  Turn34: U -> y35=3 (freeway3 at turn35: we check freeway3 at turn35)\n\nFreeway3 at turn35: \n  Cars: \n    First: (48,37,right,12) -> [37+12*5,48+12*5] = [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe.\n    Second: (12,1,right,12) -> [1+12*5,12+60]=[61,72] -> safe.\n    Third: (-24,-35,right,12) -> [-35+12*5, -24+60] = [-35+60,36] = [25,36] -> safe.\n\nThen:\n  Turn35: U -> y36=4 (freeway4 at turn36: similar to freeway3? Actually, freeway4 has the same cars? So at turn36: \n    Third car: [-35+12*6, -24+72] = [-35+72,48] = [37,48] -> safe.\n\n  Turn36: U -> y37=5 (freeway5 at turn37: same cars? at turn37: \n    Third car: [-35+12*7, -24+84] = [-35+84,60] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\n  Turn37: U -> y38=6 (freeway6 at turn38: \n      Car: (48,37,right,6) -> [37+6*8,48+48]=[37+48,96]=[85,96] -> safe.\n\n  Turn38: U -> y39=7 (freeway7 at turn39: \n      Car: same as freeway6? [37+6*9,48+54]=[91,102] -> safe.\n\n  Turn39: U -> y40=8 (freeway8 at turn40: \n      Cars: \n        First: (48,37,right,6) -> [37+6*10,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe.\n        Second: (0,-11,right,6) -> [-11+6*10,0+60]=[-11+60,60]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\n  Turn40: U -> y41=9 -> safe.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at turn41? And we did 10 actions: from turn30 to turn40? So H=11? Because we did 11 actions? Actually, we did 11 actions? Let me count:\n\n  Actions: \n    t30: S\n    t31: S\n    t32: U -> then at t33: y=1\n    t33: U -> y=2\n    t34: U -> y=3\n    t35: U -> y=4\n    t36: U -> y=5\n    t37: U -> y=6\n    t38: U -> y=7\n    t39: U -> y=8\n    t40: U -> y=9\n\nSo we did 11 actions: from a30 to a40. Then at turn41 we are at y=9. So H=11.\n\nBut is this minimal? We had to wait 2 turns. Maybe we can wait only one turn?\n\nTry waiting one turn:\n\n  Turn30: S -> y31=0 (safe)\n  Turn31: U -> y32=1 (freeway1 at turn32: unsafe? because at turn32, freeway1: [-24,11] -> 0 is in? so we are hit.\n\nSo we cannot wait only one turn. We must wait two turns.\n\nBut maybe we can avoid waiting by taking a detour? For example, go up to freeway1, then down? But that seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, we might wait at a different freeway? But we have to get to freeway1 and then freeway2.\n\nAnother idea: after freeway1, we go to freeway2 at turn32? But we saw freeway2 at turn32 is unsafe. Then we cannot.\n\nOr after freeway1, we wait at freeway1? But freeway1 at turn32 is unsafe.\n\nSo we must not be on freeway1 or freeway2 at turn32.\n\nWe can only be at freeway1 at turn31 or turn33? \n  At turn31: freeway1 is safe? [12,47] -> yes.\n  At turn33: [-60,-25] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2: safe at turn31? But we cannot be at freeway2 at turn31 because we are at freeway1 at turn31. Then we can be at freeway2 at turn33? safe? [ -60-36? no: at turn33: [48-36*3,83-108]=[-60,-25] -> but that's freeway1's car? Actually, freeway2 has the same car: (48,83,left,36) so at turn33: [-60,-25] -> safe.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  Turn30: U -> y31=1 (freeway1 at turn31: safe)\n  Then we cannot go to freeway2 at turn32 (because that would require being at freeway1 at turn32? but then at turn32 we are at freeway1? and freeway1 at turn32 is unsafe) and also if we go to freeway2 at turn32 we are unsafe.\n\nBut we can wait at freeway1? But at turn32 we would be at freeway1 and unsafe.\n\nSo we must leave freeway1 before turn32? But we only have one action: at turn31 we can choose to go to freeway0 (down) or stay? or up? \n\nBut if we go down at turn31: \n  Turn31: D -> y32=0 (safe) -> then we are at freeway0 (safe) at turn32.\n\nThen at turn32 we are at y0. Then we can go up again.\n\nThen:\n\n  Turn30: U -> y31=1 (freeway1 at turn31: safe)\n  Turn31: D -> y32=0 (freeway0 at turn32: safe) -> but now we are back to y0, and we lost progress.\n\nThen we have to go up again. But then we can avoid the bad turn at freeway2 by going up to freeway2 at a later turn.\n\nBut when we go up again, we have to go through freeway1 again? And freeway1 at what turn?\n\nAfter turn32 at y0:\n\n  Turn32: U -> y33=1 (freeway1 at turn33: safe? [-60,-25] -> safe)\n  Turn33: U -> y34=2 (freeway2 at turn34: [48-36*4,83-144]=[-96,-61] -> safe)\n\nThen we continue as before.\n\nSo the path:\n\n  Turn30: U\n  Turn31: D   -> then at turn32: y=0\n  Turn32: U   -> y33=1\n  Turn33: U   -> y34=2\n  Then: U at turn34->y35=3, turn35->y36=4, turn36->y37=5, turn37->y38=6, turn38->y39=7, turn39->y40=8, turn40->y41=9.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at turn41? Same as before? And we did 11 actions? Actually, we did:\n\n  a30: U\n  a31: D\n  a32: U\n  a33: U\n  a34: U\n  a35: U\n  a36: U\n  a37: U\n  a38: U\n  a39: U\n  a40: U  -> then at turn41: y=9.\n\nSo 11 actions? And we did one extra detour (down and up) so that's two extra actions? Then 9+2=11.\n\nBut the previous waiting at y0 for two turns also took 11 actions.\n\nWhich one is better? Same H.\n\nBut we want minimal H. Is there a way with H=10?\n\nWe start at turn30 at y0. We do 10 actions. Then at turn40 we are at y=9? \n\nWe need to go from y0 to y9: 9 steps. But we can only move one step per action? Then we must have at least 9 actions? But we might have to detour? So 9 is minimal? But we cannot do 9 because of the block.\n\nWith 10 actions: we have one extra action that we can use to wait somewhere.\n\nBut we have to avoid freeway2 at turn32.\n\nWe can try:\n\n  Option: wait at y0 for one turn? Then:\n      Turn30: S -> y31=0\n      Turn31: U -> y32=1 -> freeway1 at turn32: unsafe? (as computed: freeway1 at turn32: [-24,11] includes 0) -> unsafe.\n\n  So not.\n\n  Option: wait at freeway1 at a safe turn? But we can only be at freeway1 at turn31 or turn33. At turn31 we are safe, but then if we wait at freeway1 at turn31, then at turn32 we are at freeway1 and unsafe.\n\n  So we cannot wait at freeway1.\n\n  Option: go up to freeway2 at a safe turn? But we have to be at freeway2 at turn33? How? \n\n      Turn30: U -> turn31: y1 (safe)\n      Turn31: S -> then we are at freeway1 at turn32: unsafe.\n\n      Turn30: U -> turn31: y1\n      Turn31: U -> then at turn32: y2 -> freeway2 at turn32: unsafe.\n\n      Turn30: S -> turn31: y0\n      Turn31: U -> turn32: y1 -> unsafe (freeway1 at turn32)\n\n      Turn30: U -> turn31: y1\n      Turn31: D -> turn32: y0 -> safe, but then we have to go up again.\n\n      Then we do: \n          Turn32: U -> turn33: y1 (freeway1 at turn33: safe)\n          Turn33: U -> turn34: y2 (freeway2 at turn34: safe)\n          Then we go up: turn34:U->y3, ... until y9: that's 9 more steps? \n\n          From y0 at turn32 to y9: 9 steps: so at turn41: y9 -> 11 actions.\n\n  How about going faster? We have to make 9 net upward moves. Any detour (like going down and then up) adds two moves. So minimal H is 9 if no detour, but if we detour, we add at least two moves? Then minimal is 11?\n\nBut wait: we don't necessarily have to detour by going down. We might skip a freeway at a bad time by waiting at a safe freeway? But we saw freeway1 and freeway2 are unsafe at turn32, so we cannot wait there.\n\nAlternatively, we might go up to freeway3 without going through freeway2? But no, we can only move to adjacent freeways.\n\nSo the minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let me check if there is a path with H=10.\n\nWe have 10 actions. We must have exactly 9 upward moves? Because we start at 0 and end at 9: net change +9. Each U is +1, D is -1, S is 0. Let u be the number of U, d the number of D, s the number of S. Then:\n\n  u - d = 9\n  u + d + s = 10\n\nThen: u = 9 + d, and substitute: \n  (9+d) + d + s = 10 -> 9 + 2d + s = 10 -> 2d + s = 1.\n\nSo d and s are nonnegative integers. Solutions:\n  Case 1: d=0, s=1 -> then u=9.\n  Case 2: d=1, s=-1 -> invalid.\n\nSo only possibility: 9 U, 1 S, and 0 D.\n\nWe must have one stay and the rest up.\n\nWe start at y0 at turn30.\n\nWe do 10 actions: 9 U and 1 S.\n\nWe have to distribute the S somewhere.\n\nWe must not be on freeway1 or freeway2 at turn32? But note: the turn when we are at freeway2 depends on when we do the S.\n\nThe path: we start at y0. We have to go to y1, then y2, ... y9.\n\nWe can do the S at any freeway and any time.\n\nWe must avoid:\n  freeway1 at turn32: unsafe\n  freeway2 at turn32: unsafe\n\nAlso, we must check the other freeways at the turns we are there.\n\nBut the other freeways are safe at the turns we would be in the direct path? Except we are shifting the entire path by the waiting.\n\nLet T be the turn when we are at freeway2.\n\nIn the direct path without waiting, we are at freeway2 at turn32.\n\nIf we do a S at some freeway, then the entire schedule after that freeway is delayed by one turn.\n\nWe can do the S at a freeway that is safe at the turn we are there, and then the subsequent freeways are visited one turn later.\n\nWe have to avoid freeway2 at turn32.\n\nSo if we do the S at freeway0 (y0) or freeway1 (y1) or freeway2 (y2) or ... \n\nBut if we do the S at freeway0: then we are at freeway0 at that turn (safe). Then the entire upward path is shifted by one turn: so we would be at freeway2 at turn33? which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we do the S at freeway1: then we are at freeway1 at that turn. We have to make sure that freeway1 at that turn is safe. But if we do the S at freeway1 at turn31: then we are at freeway1 at turn31 and turn32? But at turn32 freeway1 is unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot do the S at freeway1 at a turn that would make us be at freeway1 at turn32? \n\nBut if we do the S at freeway1 at turn31: then we are at freeway1 at turn31 (safe) and then we are still at freeway1 at turn32 (unsafe). So we get hit at turn32.\n\nIf we do the S at freeway1 at a later turn? But we are at freeway1 only at one turn in the direct path (turn31). If we do the S at freeway1, we have to be there for two consecutive turns? \n\nFor example:\n\n  Turn30: U -> y31=1 (freeway1 at turn31: safe)\n  Turn31: S -> then we are still at freeway1 at turn32? unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot do the S at freeway1.\n\nIf we do the S at freeway2: \n  We would be at freeway2 for two consecutive turns? \n\n  How? We get to freeway2 at turn32? Then we do S at turn32? Then we are at freeway2 at turn33? \n\n  But at turn32 we are at freeway2: and that is unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway3 to freeway8: we can do the S there? Then we avoid freeway2 at turn32? \n\nBut if we do the S at freeway3, then we are at freeway3 for two turns? \n\nIn the direct path we are at freeway3 at turn33. If we do the S at freeway3 at turn33, then we are at freeway3 at turn33 and turn34? \n\nBut we must check freeway3 at turn33 and turn34? \n\nAt turn33: freeway3 is safe (as we computed earlier: the third car is at [1,12] at turn33? no: at turn33: the third car is [ -35+12*(33-30)= -35+36=1, -24+36=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in? safe.\n\nAt turn34: freeway3: \n  Third car: [-35+12*4, -24+48] = [13,24] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway3 is safe at both turns.\n\nBut if we do the S at freeway3, then we get to freeway3 at turn33 (as usual) and then we stay at turn33? Then at turn34 we are still at freeway3? Then we move to freeway4 at turn34? Then we are at freeway4 at turn34? \n\nBut in the direct path we were at freeway4 at turn34. Now we are at freeway4 at turn34? Or no: we did an extra stay at freeway3.\n\nActually, the schedule:\n\n  Turn30: U -> y31=1\n  Turn31: U -> y32=2\n  Turn32: U -> y33=3\n  Turn33: S -> y34=3   (so we are at freeway3 at turn34? But we were already at freeway3 at turn33? So we are at freeway3 at turn33 and turn34? Then at turn34 we are at freeway3? Then we move to freeway4 at turn34? Then at turn34 we are at freeway3? and then we move to freeway4 at the next turn? \n\nActually, at turn33: we are at freeway3? Then we do S at turn33: so we are still at freeway3 at turn34? Then at turn34 we do U: then at turn35 we are at freeway4.\n\nSo we are at freeway3 at turn33 and turn34? Both safe? \n\nThen we are at freeway4 at turn35? (instead of turn34 in the direct path)\n\nWe must check freeway4 at turn35? \n\nFreeway4: same as freeway3? Then at turn35: \n  Third car: [-35+12*5, -24+60] = [25,36] -> safe.\n\nThen freeway5 at turn36? \n  Third car: [-35+12*6, -24+72] = [37,48] -> safe.\n\nfreeway6 at turn37: \n  Car: (48,37,right,6) -> [37+6*7,48+42]=[37+42,90]=[79,90] -> safe.\n\nfreeway7 at turn38: [37+6*8,48+48]=[85,96] -> safe.\n\nfreeway8 at turn39: \n  First car: [37+6*9,48+54]=[91,102] -> safe.\n  Second car: [-11+6*9,0+54]=[-11+54,54]=[43,54] -> safe.\n\nThen freeway9 at turn40? But we are at freeway8 at turn39? Then at turn39 we do U: to y9? Then at turn40 we are at y9? \n\nBut we have 10 actions? \n\nSequence:\n\n  a30: U -> y31=1\n  a31: U -> y32=2\n  a32: U -> y33=3\n  a33: S -> y34=3   (we are at freeway3 at turn33 and turn34? Actually, at turn33: we are at freeway3? Then we do S at turn33: so at the next state (turn34) we are still at y=3? So at turn34 we are at freeway3? Then we do:\n  a34: U -> y35=4\n  a35: U -> y36=5\n  a36: U -> y37=6\n  a37: U -> y38=7\n  a38: U -> y39=8\n  a39: U -> y40=9\n\nWe did 10 actions: from a30 to a39. Then at turn40 we are at y=9? \n\nBut we must check the turns:\n\n  Turn30: y=0 -> safe\n  Turn31: y=1 -> freeway1: at turn31: safe? [12,47] -> yes.\n  Turn32: y=2 -> freeway2: at turn32: unsafe? [ -24,11] -> yes, unsafe.\n\nOh! We are at freeway2 at turn32? Because at turn32 we are at y=2? \n\nBut we did: \n  Turn30: U -> at turn31: y=1\n  Turn31: U -> at turn32: y=2\n\nSo we are at freeway2 at turn32 -> collision.\n\nSo we didn't avoid the freeway2 at turn32.\n\nWe did the S at freeway3 at turn33, but we already passed freeway2 at turn32.\n\nSo to avoid freeway2 at turn32, we must not be at freeway2 at turn32. \n\nTherefore, we must be at freeway2 at a different turn. But we were at freeway2 at turn32 because we went up two steps.\n\nThe only way to avoid freeway2 at turn32 is to be at freeway2 at a different turn. But to be at freeway2 at turn33, we must have been at freeway1 at turn32? But freeway1 at turn32 is unsafe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal solution is to wait at y0 for two turns and then go up.\n\nOr do the down-up detour.\n\nBoth take 11 actions.\n\nWe can choose either.\n\nI choose the waiting at y0 for two turns.\n\nSo:\n\n  Turn30: S\n  Turn31: S\n  Turn32: U\n  Turn33: U\n  Turn34: U\n  Turn35: U\n  Turn36: U\n  Turn37: U\n  Turn38: U\n  Turn39: U\n  Turn40: U\n\nThen at turn41: y=9.\n\nBut we must output the actions for turns 30 to 40? That is 11 actions.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n  Turn30: S\n  Turn31: S\n  Turn32: U\n  Turn33: U\n  Turn34: U\n  Turn35: U\n  Turn36: U\n  Turn37: U\n  Turn38: U\n  Turn39: U\n  Turn40: U\n\nBut note: after the last action (at turn40) we are at y=9? \n  At turn40: we do U, so y41 = y40 + 1? \n  But we started at turn30 at y0.\n\n  After turn30 (S): y31=0\n  After turn31 (S): y32=0\n  After turn32 (U): y33=1\n  After turn33 (U): y34=2\n  After turn34 (U): y35=3\n  After turn35 (U): y36=4\n  After turn36 (U): y37=5\n  After turn37 (U): y38=6\n  After turn38 (U): y39=7\n  After turn39 (U): y40=8\n  After turn40 (U): y41=9 -> reached.\n\nSo it works.\n\nNow, we must check that we are safe at every turn from 30 to 40? \n\nAt turn30: y=0 -> safe.\nTurn31: y=0 -> safe.\nTurn32: y=0 -> safe.\nTurn33: y=1 -> freeway1: at turn33: car: [48-36*3,83-108]=[-60,-25] -> safe.\nTurn34: y=2 -> freeway2: at turn34: [48-36*4,83-144]=[-96,-61] -> safe.\nTurn35: y=3 -> freeway3: at turn35: \n        cars: [37+12*5,48+60]=[97,108] (first) -> safe; [1+60,12+60]=[61,72] (second) -> safe; [-35+60,-24+60]=[25,36] (third) -> safe.\nTurn36: y=4 -> freeway4: at turn36: same as freeway3 at turn36? \n        third car: [-35+12*6, -24+72]=[37,48] -> safe.\nTurn37: y=5 -> freeway5: at turn37: third car: [-35+12*7, -24+84]=[49,60] -> safe.\nTurn38: y=6 -> freeway6: at turn38: car: [37+6*8,48+48]=[85,96] -> safe.\nTurn39: y=7 -> freeway7: at turn39: same as freeway6? [37+6*9,48+54]=[91,102] -> safe.\nTurn40: y=8 -> freeway8: at turn40: \n        first car: [37+6*10,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe.\n        second car: [-11+60,0+60]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 30: S\nTurn 31: S\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and we have H=11.\n\nWe output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 30: S\nTurn 31: S\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\n}\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn40, and we have 11 actions.\n\nWe can write it as above.\n\nIs there a solution with H=10? We argued that it requires 9 U and 1 S, but then we cannot avoid the collision at freeway2 at turn32. So no.\n\nTherefore, this is minimal.\n\nWe could also do the down-up detour, but that also has 11 actions.\n\nSo we output the above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 30 while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) is 11. The sequence of actions ensures the player avoids being on freeways 1 or 2 at turn 32, where collisions occur due to cars covering position 0. By staying at \\(y = 0\\) for the first two turns (turns 30 and 31), the player avoids freeways 1 and 2 during the dangerous turn 32. Starting from turn 32, the player moves upward each turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 41.\n\nThe car configurations at turn 30 are used to compute future spans. For example:\n- Freeway 1 at turn 33: car \\((48, 83, \\text{left}, 36)\\) spans \\([-60, -25]\\), safe.\n- Freeway 2 at turn 34: car \\((48, 83, \\text{left}, 36)\\) spans \\([-96, -61]\\), safe.\n- Freeway 3 at turn 35: cars are safe (spans \\([97, 108]\\), \\([61, 72]\\), \\([25, 36]\\)).\n- Freeways 4 to 8 are similarly safe at their respective turns.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 30: S \\\\\nTurn 31: S \\\\\nTurn 32: U \\\\\nTurn 33: U \\\\\nTurn 34: U \\\\\nTurn 35: U \\\\\nTurn 36: U \\\\\nTurn 37: U \\\\\nTurn 38: U \\\\\nTurn 39: U \\\\\nTurn 40: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,0) at turn 32 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: U for up (y+1), D for down (y-1), S for stay (y same). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I have the head, tail, direction, and speed at turn 32. I need to find where they are at future turns to avoid collisions.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that y, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. Importantly, if I move to a new y at turn T, I'm not on that new y until turn T+1, so I only care about the y I'm on at the start of the turn when I choose the action.\n\nThe player position is updated after the action, so at turn T, I'm at y_T, I choose a_T, then I move to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy based on a_T.\n\nBut for collision, it says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\" And y_T is my position at turn T, before the action.\n\nAlso, note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, collision is checked based on my current y at the beginning of the turn, and the car positions at that same turn.\n\nAt turn T:\n\n- I am at position y_T.\n\n- I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\n- During turn T, I am on freeway y_T.\n\n- For cars on freeway y_T, if any car has 0 in its span at turn T, I collide.\n\n- If I move to a different freeway, I'm not on that new one until turn T+1.\n\nSo, to avoid collision, for each turn T, when I'm on y_T, I need that for freeway y_T, no car has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nNow, the cars are defined for each freeway k=1 to 8.\n\nLet me list all cars and their positions at turn 32, and how they move.\n\nFirst, for left-moving cars: direction left, so they move left, decreasing x.\n\nThe span: for left-moving, head h, tail τ, with h > τ I assume? The notation: for left-moving, span at t1 is [h, τ], and it moves to [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] at turn T.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, span [τ, h] to [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)].\n\nIn the car state table, for freeway k, it lists cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\n83 and 48, but if direction is left, and head is 48, tail is 83? That seems odd because usually head is the front, but for left-moving, if it's moving left, head should be the left end or right end?\n\nLet's clarify the span.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and it moves left, so h and τ both decrease.\n\nBut [h, τ] with h and τ, which is larger?\n\nIn freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36), so h=48, τ=83. But 48 < 83, so [48, 83] is from 48 to 83, which is right to left? That doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps I misinterpreted.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t1\"\n\nAnd for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIf h and τ are coordinates, and for left-moving, both decrease.\n\nBut in the example, for freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36), so at t1=32, span [48, 83]. Since it's moving left, at later times, it shifts left.\n\nBut 48 to 83, if x increases to the right, then [48,83] is from left to right if 48<83, but it's moving left, so the head should be decreasing.\n\nI think I need to assume the coordinate system.\n\nProbably, x=0 is the point we care about, and cars move left or right.\n\nFor collision, we care if 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nFor a left-moving car, span [h, τ] at t1, with h and τ, and since it's moving left, if h < τ, then [h,τ] is increasing, but moving left means decreasing both.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nIn freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36), h=48, τ=83, and since left-moving, at T, span [48 - s(T-32), 83 - s(T-32)]\n\nSince s=36, and T-32 is turns after.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut 48 and 83, 48 < 83, so [48,83] is from x=48 to x=83, and moving left, so it's shifting to smaller x.\n\nAt some point, it might cover x=0.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, e.g. freeway 3: (48, 37, right, 12), etc.\n\nFor right-moving, span [τ, h] to [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed), so for right-moving, head h, tail τ.\n\nFor right-moving, \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" so τ is the left end, h is the right end, I think.\n\nLet's see the notation.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nSo in this case, τ is the left end, h is the right end, so when moving right, both increase.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 3, it has (48, 37, right, 12), so head=48, tail=37, and since right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [37, 48].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 1, (48,83,left,36), head=48, tail=83, span [h,τ] = [48,83].\n\nIn [48,83], if we assume x increases to the right, 48 to 83 is from left to right, but for left-moving, it should be moving towards decreasing x, so the head is at smaller x or larger x?\n\nI think there's inconsistency in terminology.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I should not worry about head and tail, but focus on the span and how it moves.\n\nFor collision, I only care if 0 is in the span at a given turn for the freeway I'm on.\n\nSo for each freeway and each car, I can find when 0 is covered by that car at turn T.\n\nSince the cars move linearly, the span at turn T is a interval, and I need 0 not in that interval for safety.\n\nFor a given freeway, there might be multiple cars, so I need that for all cars on that freeway, 0 is not in their span at turn T when I'm on y_T = that freeway.\n\ny_T is the row, freeway number.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to y=8, each is a row.\n\nPlayer is at (0, y_t), so x=0 always, y changes.\n\nCars are on fixed y, but moving in x.\n\nCollision if at turn T, y_T = k, and for some car on freeway k, 0 is in its span at T.\n\nSo for each freeway k, I need to find the times T when it is unsafe, i.e., some car covers x=0 at T.\n\nThen for my path, when I am on freeway k at turn T, it must be that k is safe at T.\n\nNow, let's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nCurrent turn t1 = 32.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): one car: (head=48, tail=83, direction=left, speed=36)\n\nFor left-moving, span at T: [h - s(T-32), τ - s(T-32)] = [48 - 36(T-32), 83 - 36(T-32)]\n\n0 is in span if min <= 0 <= max, but since it's [low, high], let's find when low <= 0 <= high.\n\nHere, low = 48 - 36(T-32), high = 83 - 36(T-32)\n\nSo 0 in [low, high] if low <= 0 <= high.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFirst, freeway 1:\n\nlow(T) = 48 - 36(T-32)\n\nhigh(T) = 83 - 36(T-32)\n\n0 in span if low(T) <= 0 <= high(T)\n\nWhich is:\n\n48 - 36(T-32) <= 0  and  0 <= 83 - 36(T-32)\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36(T-32) <= 0 => 48 <= 36(T-32) => T-32 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so T-32 >= 2 since T integer? T is turn, integer.\n\nT-32 must be integer, since turns discrete.\n\nSimilarly, all times integer.\n\nSo T-32 >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = 2? 48/36=4/3=1.333, ceil(1.333)=2, but let's calculate exactly.\n\n48 - 36Δ <= 0 => 36Δ >= 48 => Δ >= 48/36 = 4/3, since Δ integer, Δ >= 2\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= 83 - 36Δ => 36Δ <= 83 => Δ <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so Δ <= 2 since integer? 83/36=2.305, so Δ <= 2\n\n36*2=72, 36*3=108>83, so Δ <= floor(83/36)? 0 <= 83 - 36Δ => 36Δ <= 83 => Δ <= 83/36 ≈2.305, so since Δ integer, Δ <= 2.\n\nNow, for Δ=2: low = 48 - 36*2 = 48-72= -24, high=83-72=11, so -24 <=0<=11, true.\n\nFor Δ=1: low=48-36=12, high=83-36=47, 12<=0? 12>0, so 0 not <= high but 0 < low, so not in [12,47]\n\nSimilarly, Δ=0: [48,83], 0 not in.\n\nΔ=3: low=48-108=-60, high=83-108=-25, -60<=0<=-25? 0 > -25, not <= high, so no.\n\nSo only for Δ=2, i.e., T-32=2, T=34, 0 is in span.\n\nΔ=T-32, so at T=34, unsafe for freeway 1.\n\nFor other Δ, not.\n\nNow, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? \"2 | (48, 83, left, 36) \" so identical to freeway 1, so unsafe only at T=34.\n\nFreeway 3: multiple cars.\n\n\"3 | (48, 37, right, 12), (12, 1, right, 12), (-24, -35, right, 12)\"\n\nFirst car: (head=48, tail=37, right, speed=12)\n\nFor right-moving, span at T: [τ + s(T-32), h + s(T-32)] = [37 + 12Δ, 48 + 12Δ] where Δ=T-32\n\n0 in span if 37 + 12Δ <= 0 <= 48 + 12Δ?

Freeway 3 has three cars, but only this one covers 0 at T=34.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same as freeway 3? \"4 | (48, 37, right, 12), (12, 1, right, 12), (-24, -35, right, 12) \" identical, so unsafe at T=34.\n\nFreeway 5: same, \"5 | ... \" identical to 3 and 4, unsafe at T=34.\n\nFreeway 6: \"6 | (48, 37, right, 6) \" only one car.\n\n(48,37,right,6), head=48, tail=37, direction right.\n\nSpan [τ + sΔ, h + sΔ] = [37 + 6Δ, 48 + 6Δ]\n\n0 in if 37 + 6Δ <= 0 <= 48 + 6Δ\n\n37 + 6Δ <= 0 impossible for Δ>=0, so never unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: same, \"7 | (48, 37, right, 6) \" identical to freeway 6, never unsafe.\n\nFreeway 8: \"8 | (48, 37, right, 6), (0, -11, right, 6) \"\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6), same as above, never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (0, -11, right, 6), head=0, tail=-11, direction right.\n\nSpan [τ + sΔ, h + sΔ] = [-11 + 6Δ, 0 + 6Δ] = [-11 + 6Δ, 6Δ]\n\n0 in if -11 + 6Δ <= 0 <= 6Δ\n\nFirst: -11 + 6Δ <= 0 => 6Δ <= 11 => Δ <= 11/6 ≈ 1.833, so Δ <= 1\n\nSecond: 0 <= 6Δ => Δ >= 0, always true for Δ>=0.\n\nSo for Δ=0 and Δ=1.\n\nΔ=0: span [-11, 0], 0 included.\n\nΔ=1: span [-11+6, 6] = [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nΔ=2: [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo at Δ=0 and Δ=1, i.e., T=32 and T=33, unsafe for freeway 8.\n\nT=32: Δ=0, T=33: Δ=1.\n\nNow, summarize unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: unsafe at T=34\n\n- y=2: unsafe at T=34\n\n- y=3: unsafe at T=34\n\n- y=4: unsafe at T=34\n\n- y=5: unsafe at T=34\n\n- y=6: always safe\n\n- y=7: always safe\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=32 and T=33\n\nAt T=32, player is at y=0, not on any freeway, so no collision. Freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I assume no cars, so always safe.\n\ny=0: player starts at (0,0), and y=9 is target.\n\nAt y=0 and y=9, no cars, so always safe.\n\nBut when on y=1 to 8, need to check.\n\nAt turn T=32, player is at y=0, which is safe.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since y=0 to y=9, with moves U (+1), D (-1), S (0), the fastest is 9 Up moves in a row, but may not be possible due to cars.\n\nBut with cars, I need to avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nNow, unsafe times: only at specific times, and for y=1-5 unsafe at T=34, y=8 unsafe at T=32 and T=33.\n\nT=32: y=8 unsafe, but player at y=0, not on it.\n\nT=33: y=8 unsafe.\n\nT=34: y=1,2,3,4,5 unsafe.\n\ny=6 and y=7 always safe.\n\ny=8 unsafe only at T=32 and T=33, but T=32 is past, and at T=33, if I am on y=8, unsafe, but I can avoid being on y=8 at T=33.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, player starts at T=32, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 by some turn.\n\nLet me denote turns starting from T=32.\n\nAt T=32: position y=0, safe.\n\nI choose action a_{32}, then go to y_{33}.\n\ny_{33} = y_{32} + Δy, with Δy based on a_{32}.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI need y_{t} for t >=32.\n\nThe target is to have y_{T} =9 for some T, and minimize H, the number of turns, so from T=32 to T=32+H-1, with y_{32+H-1}=9.\n\nH is the number of actions, so from t=32 to t=32+H-1, actions taken, position at t=32+H-1 is (0,9).\n\nFor example, if I do nothing, at T=32, y=0, not 9.\n\nI need to move up.\n\nMinimal H: if I go up every turn, after 9 turns, at T=32+9-1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T, after action, position is for that turn.\n\nDefine: at start of turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, position becomes y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nStart: turn T=32, y_32 = 0.\n\nAfter a_32, y_33 = y_32 + Δy(a_32)\n\nSimilarly, after a_{33}, y_34, and so on.\n\nI need for some T, y_T =9.\n\nAnd for each turn S, when I am at y_S, it must be safe, meaning if y_S = k for k=1-8, then k is safe at turn S.\n\nIf y_S =0 or 9, always safe.\n\nNow, unsafe times:\n\n- For k=1 to 5: unsafe only at S=34\n\n- k=6 and k=7: always safe\n\n- k=8: unsafe at S=33 and S=32, but S=32 is past, so only unsafe at S=33\n\nS=32: k=8 unsafe, but at S=32, I am at y=0, not on k=8.\n\nSo for future, k=8 unsafe only at S=33.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=1 to 5 at turn 34, and avoid being on y=8 at turn 33.\n\nAlso, y=6 and y=7 always safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nThe shortest path is 9 up moves, but let's see if possible.\n\nSuppose I go up every turn.\n\nStart T=32, y=0, safe.\n\na_32 = U, then y_33 =1\n\nAt T=33, y=1, now is it safe? y=1 is freeway 1, at T=33, is it unsafe?\n\nFor y=1, unsafe only at T=34, not at T=33, so at T=33, y=1 is safe? Let me confirm.\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe only at T=34, as we calculated.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 to 5 same.\n\nAt T=33, y=1, safe.\n\nThen a_33 = U, y_34 =2\n\nAt T=34, y=2, now T=34, and y=2, which is unsafe at T=34, so collision!\n\nOh, problem.\n\nIf I go up at T=33 to y=2 at T=34, but at T=34, I am on y=2, which is unsafe.\n\nSpecifically, at turn T=34, I am at y_34, and if y_34 is between 1 and 5, it is unsafe.\n\nIn this case, y_34=2, unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=1,2,3,4,5 at turn 34.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be on y=8 at turn 33.\n\nNow, with up moves only, I would be on y=1 at T=33, y=2 at T=34, but y=2 at T=34 is bad.\n\nI need to avoid being on rows 1-5 at T=34.\n\nSince T=34 is a critical time, I should not be on those rows at that turn.\n\nSimilarly, for row 8, avoid at T=33.\n\nNow, possible strategies:\n\n- Delay my movement so that I am not on 1-5 at T=34.\n\n- Or, be on safe rows at that time.\n\nSafe rows at T=34: y=6 and y=7 are always safe, and y=0,9 but if I am at y=0 or 9, I might not be moving, but y=9 is target.\n\nAlso, y=8 at T=34 is safe, since only unsafe at T=33.\n\ny=8 unsafe only at T=33, so at T=34 it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=1-5 unsafe only at T=34, so other times safe.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nI start at T=32, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H: if no obstacles, H=10 actions? Let's see.\n\nTo go from y=0 to y=9, I need 9 up moves, but each up move increases y by 1, starting from y=0.\n\nAfter first U at T=32, y_33=1\n\nAfter second U at T=33, y_34=2\n\n...\n\nAfter k-th U, y_{32+k} = k\n\nSet y_{32+k} = k\n\nThen to have y=9, k=9, so at turn T=32+9=41? Turns:\n\nAt turn T=32, y=0\n\nAfter a_32, y_33\n\nAfter a_33, y_34\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{32+t}, y_{33+t}\n\nSet t such that after H actions, position at turn 32+H.\n\nTurn 32: after 0 actions, y_32\n\nAfter 1 action (a_32), y_33\n\nAfter 2 actions (a_32,a_33), y_34\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, y_{32+H}\n\nSet y_{32+H} =9.\n\nSince I start from y=0, and each U increases by 1, I need at least 9 U actions to reach y=9.\n\nWith exactly 9 U and no S or D, I reach y_41 =9, where 32+9=41? After H actions, y_{32+H}.\n\ny_32 =0\n\ny_33 = y_32 + Δy_32\n\nIf all U, y_{32+H} = H\n\nSet equal to 9, so H=9, y_{41} =9.\n\nTurns: from T=32 to T=40, actions a_32 to a_40, 9 actions, y_41=9.\n\nH=9 turns? H is number of actions, so from t=0 to H-1 relative to start.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nHere t_1=32, actions a_32 to a_{32+H-1}, and position at t_1 + H -1 is (0,9).\n\nAfter H actions, position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nt_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t_1, position (0,y_{t1})\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, position for turn t1+1 is set.\n\nAfter last action a_{t1+H-1}, position at turn (t1+H-1) +1? No.\n\nDefine turn index.\n\nAt time t, turn t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t determines Δy_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo sequence: for t from t1 to t1+H-1, actions a_t, resulting in y_{t1+H} =9.\n\ny_{t1} is given, y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nNumber of actions H.\n\nFrom y_{t1} to y_{t1+H}, net change +9, since y_{t1}=0 to y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nEach U: +1, D: -1, S: 0.\n\nMinimal H is 9, with all U.\n\nBut with cars, it may take more if we need to wait.\n\nNow, in all U case: at T=33, y=1; T=34, y=2; ... up to T=41, y=9.\n\nBut at T=34, y=2, which is unsafe.\n\nSo collision at T=34.\n\nThus, I need to avoid that.\n\nPossible ways:\n\n- Be on a safe row at T=34.\n\nSafe rows at T=34: y=0,6,7,8,9\n\ny=0: but I need to go up, if I stay at y=0, not progress.\n\ny=6 or 7: but at T=34, if I am at y=6 or 7, safe.\n\ny=8: also safe at T=34.\n\ny=9: target.\n\nBut at T=34, if I am at y=6,7,8, safe, but I need to reach y=9 later.\n\nSimilarly, I also need to avoid y=8 at T=33.\n\nNow, let's plan the path turn by turn.\n\nStart T=32, y=0, safe.\n\nI need to choose a_32.\n\nOptions: U, D, S.\n\nD to y=-1? But y must be in [0,9], so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so I cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nSo at y=0, cannot go D, only U or S.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, cannot go U.\n\nSo a_32: U or S.\n\nIf S, y_33=0, but no progress.\n\nIf U, y_33=1.\n\nNow, at T=33, y=1.\n\nNow, y=1 is freeway, at T=33, is it safe? From earlier, y=1 unsafe only at T=34, not T=33, so safe at T=33.\n\nThen at T=33, I choose a_33.\n\nIf I go U, y_34=2, but at T=34, y=2, unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nSo I cannot go U at T=33 if I am at y=1, because that puts me at y=2 at T=34.\n\nBut at T=33, I am at y=1, I can choose other actions.\n\na_33: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, y_34=2, unsafe.\n\nIf D, y_34=0, then at T=34, y=0, safe.\n\nIf S, y_34=1, at T=34, y=1, which is unsafe since T=34 and y=1.\n\ny=1 unsafe at T=34, so if I stay at y=1 or go to y=2, both bad.\n\nOnly if I go down to y=0.\n\nSo at T=33, from y=1, if I go D, y_34=0, safe.\n\nThen I have to go up again later, which takes more turns.\n\nSimilarly, I could have stayed at y=0 at beginning.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=6 or 7 before T=34, since they are always safe.\n\nBut y=6 and 7 are safe, but I need to reach there.\n\nFrom y=0, to y=6, min 6 up moves.\n\nT=32: start y=0\n\nIf all U: T=33 y=1, T=34 y=2, but T=34 y=2 unsafe.\n\nSo I need to be at least y=6 by T=34? Not necessarily, but at T=34, I need to be on safe row.\n\nPossible safe rows at T=34: y=0,6,7,8,9\n\ny=0: I can be there, but not progress.\n\ny=6,7,8: good.\n\ny=9: target.\n\nNow, to reach y=6 by T=34, that is y_34=6.\n\ny_32=0\n\ny_33 = y_32 + Δy_32\n\ny_34 = y_33 + Δy_33\n\nIf I want y_34=6, then from y_32=0, in two moves, I need to increase by 6, but each move max +1, so impossible to reach y=6 in two moves from y=0.\n\nMax y_34: if U at T=32 and U at T=33, y_33=1, y_34=2.\n\nMin y_34=0 or less, but bounded.\n\nSo at T=34, the possible y positions: from y_32=0, after two actions, y_34 can be 0,1,2.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If a_32=S, a_33=S, y_34=0\n\n- a_32=S, a_33=U, y_34=1\n\n- a_32=S, a_33=D, but y_33=0, D to -1 invalid, so cannot D at y=0.\n\nAt y=0, only U or S.\n\nSimilarly, if a_32=U, y_33=1\n\nThen a_33: if U, y_34=2; if S, y_34=1; if D, y_34=0\n\nSo possible y_34: 0,1,2\n\nBut safe at T=34 only if y_34=0, but y=0 is safe, but I need to go to 9, so not helpful yet.\n\ny_34=0,1,2 all not in {6,7,8,9}, so I cannot be on safe row except y=0 at T=34.\n\nBut if I am at y=0 at T=34, I waste turns.\n\nThen later I can go up.\n\nBut minimal H might be larger.\n\nAnother option: be on y=8 at T=34, but y_34=8, but from y_32=0, impossible to reach y=8 in two moves.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 or7 impossible.\n\nSo inevitably, at T=34, I must be on y=0,1, or 2, all of which except y=0 are unsafe at T=34 if y=1 or2.\n\ny=0 is safe, y=1 and y=2 unsafe.\n\nSo the only safe choice at T=34 is to be at y=0.\n\nTherefore, I need y_34 = 0.\n\nNow, how to achieve that.\n\ny_34 = y_33 + Δy_33\n\ny_33 = y_32 + Δy_32\n\ny_32=0\n\nTo have y_34=0.\n\ny_33 can be 0 or 1 (since from y=0, y_33=0 if S, or 1 if U)\n\nIf y_33=0, then to have y_34=0, I can do S or D, but D invalid, so S, so a_33=S.\n\nIf y_33=1, then to have y_34=0, I must do D, so a_33=D.\n\nAlso, if I do U at T=32, y_33=1, then D at T=33, y_34=0.\n\nOr, S at T=32, y_33=0, then S at T_33, y_34=0.\n\nBut S at T_32 and S at T_33, y_34=0, but no progress.\n\nWhereas U then D: I go to y=1 and back to y=0, also no progress, but same as staying.\n\nIn terms of position, same, but I used actions, so for minimal time, better to stay, but since I need to go up, staying is worse.\n\nBut in this case, to avoid collision, I need to be at y=0 at T=34.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nBut at T=34, y=0, safe.\n\nThen I can start going up.\n\nNow, also, I need to avoid y=8 at T=33.\n\nBut at T=33, where am I?\n\nIn the case above, if I do S at T_32, y_33=0, or U at T_32, y_33=1.\n\nAt T=33, if y_33=0, which is safe, not on freeway.\n\nIf y_33=1, also safe, as we said earlier.\n\ny=1 safe at T=33.\n\nNow, y=8 unsafe at T=33, but I am not on y=8, since y_33=0 or1.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, so to have y_34=0, I have two choices:\n\nOption 1: a_32=S, then y_33=0, then a_33=S, y_34=0\n\nOption 2: a_32=U, y_33=1, then a_33=D, y_34=0\n\nIn both cases, after T=34, I am at y=0.\n\nNow, from there, I can go up to y=9.\n\nBut with Option 1, I wasted two turns doing nothing.\n\nWith Option 2, I went to y=1 and back, also wasted, but same net.\n\nIn both, at T=34, y=0.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9 from y=0, which takes at least 9 more actions.\n\nFor example, all U: a_34 to a_42 U, y_35=1, y_36=2, ..., y_43=9.\n\ny_34=0\n\na_34=U, y_35=1\n\na_35=U, y_36=2\n\n...\n\na_42=U, y_43=9\n\nSo actions from a_34 to a_42, that's 9 actions, plus the initial two actions to get to y_34=0.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=32 to t=32+H-1, with y_{32+H}=9.\n\nHere, after a_32 and a_33, we have y_34=0.\n\nThen from a_34 to a_42, 9 actions, y_43=9.\n\nSo total actions: a_32 to a_42, that's 11 actions (t=32 to 42).\n\nH=11, y_{43}=9.\n\nBut with Option 2: a_32=U, a_33=D, y_34=0, same as above.\n\nNow, can I do better?\n\nPerhaps I can be at a higher y later, but at T=34 I must be at y=0 to be safe.\n\nUnless I can be on y=6 or7, but impossible in two moves.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 and y=7 are always safe, I could go directly to them after T=34.\n\nBut at T=34 I need to be safe, which forces me to y=0.\n\nPerhaps I can go up slowly or something.\n\nBut let's see if I can avoid T=34 on unsafe rows by being elsewhere.\n\nFor example, suppose at T=33, I am at y=0 or y=1, both safe at T=33.\n\nThen at T=34, if I am at y=0, safe.\n\nBut if I could be at y=6, impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can use down moves, but from low y, not helpful.\n\nAnother thought: T=34 is critical, but I can be on y=8 at T=34, but to reach y=8 from y=0 by T=34, impossible.\n\nT=34 is only two turns after start.\n\nSo I think I must be at y=0,1,2 at T=34, and only y=0 is safe.\n\nThus, I need y_34=0.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nBut when going up, I need to avoid other issues.\n\nFor example, after T=34, I go up.\n\ny_34=0\n\na_34=U, y_35=1\n\nAt T=35, y=1, now is it safe? Freeway 1, unsafe only at T=34, which is past, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all freeways 1-5 are unsafe only at T=34, so after that, they are safe.\n\ny=6 and7 always safe.\n\ny=8 unsafe only at T=33, past.\n\nSo after T=34, all rows are safe at all times.\n\nIs that true?\n\ny=1 to 5: unsafe only at T=34, so for T>34, safe.\n\ny=6,7: always safe.\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=33, so for T>33, safe? T=34 and later, safe.\n\nT=33 unsafe, but T=34 safe, as we have.\n\nSo yes, for all T >=35, all freeways are safe, since no other unsafe times.\n\nSimilarly, T=34 we handled by being at y=0.\n\nSo from y_34=0, I can go up directly to y=9 in 9 moves.\n\nBut in the path, at T=35, y=1; T=36, y=2; ... up to T=43, y=9.\n\nAll safe because T>=35.\n\nNow, back to the beginning: how to get to y_34=0.\n\nWith a_32 and a_33.\n\nTo minimize time, I should not waste actions, but in both options, I end at y=0 at T=34 with two actions, but with U then D, I moved but came back, or S S, stayed.\n\nNet, same position.\n\nBut for the sequence, I can choose either.\n\nNow, also, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut H should be minimal, so 11 actions? But perhaps I can reach faster by not going down.\n\nIs there a way to be at y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if I could be at higher y at T=34, but only safe is y=0, so no.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=6 or7 before, but I can't reach by T=34.\n\nAnother idea: what if at T=33, I am at y=8? But y=8 is unsafe at T=33.\n\nAt T=33, y=8 unsafe, so I cannot be on y=8 at T=33.\n\nMoreover, from y=0, to reach y=8 in one move? Impossible, max y_33=1.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the only way is to have y_34=0, then go up.\n\nMinimal H=11: 2 actions to get to y=0 at T=34, plus 9 to y=9.\n\nWith y_{43}=9.\n\nActions from a_32 to a_42.\n\nNow, for the actions to get y_34=0, I can do, for example, a_32=U, a_33=D, or a_32=S, a_33=S.\n\nBut a_32=S, a_33=S is simpler, no movement.\n\nBut both fine.\n\nNow, I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a shorter way.\n\nSuppose I go up at T=32 to y_33=1.\n\nThen at T=33, instead of going down, I stay? But if I stay, y_34=1, which is unsafe at T=34.\n\nNot possible.\n\nOr go up, y_34=2, unsafe.\n\nOnly down to 0.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=6 directly after, but no shortcut.\n\nAnother thought: since y=6 and y=7 are always safe, I could go there and wait, but at T=34 I have to be low, so not helpful.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 in fewer than 11 actions? But from y=0, min 9 actions, but I have to spend two actions to deal with T=34, so 11 is minimal.\n\nUnless I can be at y=9 before T=34, but impossible, since at T=32 y=0, T=33 y<=1, T=34 y<=2, all less than 9.\n\nSo y=9 at earliest T=41 with all U, but that had collision.\n\nSo with detour, T=43.\n\nH=11 actions.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to specify the actions.\n\nAlso, in the answer format.\n\nNow, but in the car state, freeway 8 has a car at T=32 and T=33 unsafe, but since I am not on it, fine.\n\nNow, let's write the sequence.\n\nI can choose either way to get to y_34=0.\n\nSay, for simplicity, a_32=S, a_33=S, then y_34=0.\n\nThen from there, a_34 to a_42 all U.\n\na_34=U, y_35=1\n\na_35=U, y_36=2\n\n...\n\na_42=U, y_43=9\n\nActions: a_32 to a_42, that's 11 actions.\n\nTurn t_1=32, actions from t=32 to t=42.\n\nt from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=11, so t from 32 to 32+10=42? t_1 + H -1 = 32 + 11 -1 = 42.\n\nYes.\n\nPositions:\n\nT=32: y=0\n\na_32=S, T=33: y=0 (since S, no change)\n\na_33=S, T=34: y=0\n\na_34=U, T=35: y=1\n\na_35=U, T=36: y=2\n\na_36=U, T=37: y=3\n\na_37=U, T=38: y=4\n\na_38=U, T=39: y=5\n\na_39=U, T=40: y=6\n\na_40=U, T=41: y=7\n\na_41=U, T=42: y=8\n\na_42=U, T=43: y=9\n\nT=43 is after a_42, y_43=9.\n\nNow, check safety:\n\nAt T=32: y=0, safe.\n\nT=33: y=0, safe (not on freeway)\n\nT=34: y=0, safe\n\nT=35: y=1, freeway 1, at T=35>34, safe\n\nT=36: y=2, safe\n\n...\n\nT=42: y=8, freeway 8, at T=42, safe since unsafe only at T=33.\n\nT=43: y=9, target, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nWith a_32=U, a_33=D: then T=32: y=0, a_32=U, T=33: y=1\n\nThen a_33=D, T=34: y=0\n\nThen same as above from a_34.\n\nBut at T=33, y=1, which is safe, no issue.\n\nThen same.\n\nBut in this case, I went to y=1 and back, which might not be necessary, but same number of actions.\n\nI think S S is fine.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to output for each turn.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and sequence.\n\nIs there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose I can reach y=9 at T=41, but with y_41=9.\n\ny_41=9, so after H actions, y_{32+H}=9.\n\nIf H=9, y_{41}=9.\n\nBut to have y_41=9, with y_32=0, net +9, so 9 U moves.\n\nBut earlier, with all U: y_33=1, y_34=2, ..., y_41=9.\n\nBut at T=34, y=2, unsafe.\n\nIf I can avoid being on unsafe row at that time, but I have to be on y=2 or something.\n\nUnless I am on a different row, but I can't, since I'm going straight up.\n\nIf I go down at some point, but that would require more actions to compensate, so H larger, not smaller.\n\nFor example, if I go up to y=1 at T=33, then at T=33, instead of up, I go down to y=0 at T=34, but then I have to go up again, so I need more moves.\n\nFor instance, to reach y=9, I need net +9, but if I go down once, I need an extra up, so H=10 at least, but let's see.\n\nSuppose H=10, y_{42}=9.\n\ny_32=0, y_42=9, net +9 in 10 actions, so I must have 9 U and 1 other move, which could be S or D.\n\nIf S, no net loss, but extra turn.\n\nIf D, net loss, need extra U.\n\nBut in this case, with the cars, I still have the T=34 issue.\n\nFor example, suppose I do: a_32=U, y_33=1\n\na_33=S, but if a_33=S, y_34=1, which at T=34 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\na_33=D, y_34=0, safe.\n\nThen from y_34=0, I need to go to y_42=9, which requires 8 more U, but y_34=0 to y_42=9, 8 moves? y_35 to y_42.\n\ny_34=0, a_34=U, y_35=1, ..., up to a_41=U, y_42=8, then a_42=U, y_43=9, so to y_43=9, I need up to a_42.\n\nWith y_34=0, to y_43=9, need 9 actions from a_34 to a_42.\n\nBut with a_32 and a_33, I have two actions to get to y_34=0.\n\nSo total 11 actions to y_43=9.\n\nIf I want y_42=9, that would be earlier, but from y_32=0, with 10 actions, y_42=9.\n\nBut to have y_42=9, I need net +9 in 10 actions, so for example, 9 U and 1 S, or 10 U but impossible since max +1 per move, so must have one non-U, e.g., S or D.\n\nBut if I have a S, I stay somewhere, or D, I go down.\n\nBut in any case, at T=34, y_34 must be between 0 and 2, and only y=0 safe.\n\nSo if y_34=0, then from there to y_42=9, I need to gain 9 in 8 moves, impossible, since max 8, y_42=y_34 + sum Δy from t=34 to 41, 8 actions, y_42 <= y_34 + 8.\n\nIf y_34=0, y_42 <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, if y_34=1, y_42 <=9, but y_34=1 unsafe if at T=34.\n\nBut y_34=1 at T=34 unsafe, cannot.\n\nSimilarly y_34=2 unsafe.\n\nSo only possible if y_34=0, but then y_42 <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nThus, impossible to reach y=9 at T=42 or earlier with the constraint.\n\nEarliest possible is T=43 with y_43=9, H=11 actions.\n\nThus, minimal H=11.\n\nNow for the sequence, I can use a_32=S, a_33=S, then a_34 to a_42 all U.\n\nTo make it cleaner, since from a_34 to a_42 U, but a_42 is the last action.\n\nIn the sequence, all U from 34 to 42.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nTurn 32: S (since we stay)\n\nIn the answer, it should be for each turn starting from t_1.\n\nAlso, I need to output the actions.\n\nSince with a_32=U and a_33=D, it's similar, but S S might be simpler.\n\nIn the car state, freeway 8 has a car at T=32, but we not on it.\n\nNow, another thing: at T=33, if I am at y=0, fine.\n\nBut in the sequence with S S, at T=33 y=0, no car issue.\n\nWith U D, at T=33 y=1, which is safe.\n\nBut I think S S is fine.\n\nTo be consistent, let's use S S.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 32: S\n\nTurn 33: S\n\nThen Turn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 42: U\n\nTurns: from 32 to 42, that's 11 turns.\n\nList:\n\nTurn 32: S\n\nTurn 33: S\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nThen position at turn 43: y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions up to turn 42.\n\nNow, check if any collision.\n\nAt turn 32: y=0, safe\n\nTurn 33: y=0, safe\n\nTurn 34: y=0, safe\n\nTurn 35: y=1, freeway 1, T=35, safe (since unsafe only at T=34)\n\nTurn 36: y=2, safe\n\nTurn 37: y=3, safe\n\nTurn 38: y=4, safe\n\nTurn 39: y=5, safe\n\nTurn 40: y=6, freeway 6, always safe\n\nTurn 41: y=7, freeway 7, always safe\n\nTurn 42: y=8, freeway 8, T=42, safe (unsafe only at T=33)\n\nThen after action at turn 42, y_43=9, reached.\n\nAll safe.\n\nIf I used U and D at beginning:\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: D\n\nThen Turn 34: U\n\n...\n\nSame from turn 34 on.\n\nBut at turn 33: y=1, which is safe, as established.\n\nBut S S is fewer moves, same actions.\n\nS S means I stay, but in terms of action count, same.\n\nNow, about freeway 8: at turn 32, it is unsafe, but we at y=0, not on it.\n\nSimilarly, turn 33, y=8 unsafe, but we not on it.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 42, we on y=8, but T=42 safe.\n\nNow, I think it's fine.\n\nSo minimal H=11.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nNow, in the sequence, for the actions.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up earlier, but I have to handle T=34.\n\nAnother idea: what if I go to y=6 or 7 quickly after.\n\nBut at T=34, I still need to be safe, which requires y=0.\n\nSuppose at T=32, I go U to y=1.\n\nThen at T=33, I cannot stay or go up, must go down to y=0 at T=34.\n\nThen from T=34, I go up.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, I need to go up without delay, but I have to.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=3 at T=34, but y=3 unsafe, not possible.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps with H=10, but earlier we saw impossible to reach y=9 by T=42 with y_34=0.\n\nUnless y_34=0, then y_42 <=8, not 9.\n\nSo yes.\n\nThus, H=11.\n\nSequence as above.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nI need to output the actions from turn 32 to turn 42.\n\nIn the box.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 3,4,5 have multiple cars, but we only care when 0 covered, which we handled.\n\nFreeway 6 and 7 always safe, fine.\n\nSo I think this is the way.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 32\\) is 11. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on an unsafe freeway at an unsafe turn.\n\n### Unsafe Times for Freeways:\n- Freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\) are unsafe only at turn \\(T = 34\\) because a car covers \\(x = 0\\) at that turn.\n- Freeway \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe at turns \\(T = 32\\) and \\(T = 33\\) because a car covers \\(x = 0\\) at those turns.\n- Freeways \\(y = 6\\) and \\(y = 7\\) are always safe.\n- Positions \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) are always safe, as they are not freeways with cars.\n\n### Strategy:\n- To avoid collision at the critical turn \\(T = 34\\), the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) at that turn, as \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\) are unsafe.\n- From turn 32, with \\(y = 0\\), it is impossible to reach \\(y = 6\\), \\(y = 7\\), or \\(y = 8\\) by turn 34 in fewer than 3 actions (maximum \\(y_{34} = 2\\) with two up moves). Thus, being at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 34 is the only safe option.\n- After turn 34, all freeways are safe for \\(T \\geq 35\\) (since unsafe events only occur at \\(T = 33\\) and \\(T = 34\\), which are past).\n- From \\(y_{34} = 0\\), the player moves up (\\(U\\)) for 9 consecutive turns to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 43.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turns 32 and 33**: Stay (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 0\\), avoiding unsafe freeways and ensuring \\(y_{34} = 0\\) safely.\n- **Turns 34 to 42**: Move up (\\(U\\)) each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 43.\n\n### Sequence of Actions:\n- Turn 32: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 0\\))\n- Turn 33: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 0\\))\n- Turn 34: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 1\\))\n- Turn 35: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 2\\))\n- Turn 36: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 3\\))\n- Turn 37: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 4\\))\n- Turn 38: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 5\\))\n- Turn 39: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 6\\))\n- Turn 40: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 7\\))\n- Turn 41: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 8\\))\n- Turn 42: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 9\\))\n\nAfter the action at turn 42, the position at turn 43 is \\((0, 9)\\).\n\n### Verification:\n- **Turn 32 (\\(y = 0\\))**: Safe (not a freeway).\n- **Turn 33 (\\(y = 0\\))**: Safe (not a freeway; avoids \\(y = 8\\) unsafe at \\(T = 33\\)).\n- **Turn 34 (\\(y = 0\\))**: Safe (not a freeway; avoids unsafe \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\) at \\(T = 34\\)).\n- **Turn 35 (\\(y = 1\\))**: Safe (\\(T = 35 > 34\\), freeway 1 safe).\n- **Turn 36 (\\(y = 2\\))**: Safe (\\(T = 36 > 34\\), freeway 2 safe).\n- **Turn 37 (\\(y = 3\\))**: Safe (\\(T = 37 > 34\\), freeway 3 safe).\n- **Turn 38 (\\(y = 4\\))**: Safe (\\(T = 38 > 34\\), freeway 4 safe).\n- **Turn 39 (\\(y = 5\\))**: Safe (\\(T = 39 > 34\\), freeway 5 safe).\n- **Turn 40 (\\(y = 6\\))**: Safe (freeway 6 always safe).\n- **Turn 41 (\\(y = 7\\))**: Safe (freeway 7 always safe).\n- **Turn 42 (\\(y = 8\\))**: Safe (\\(T = 42 > 33\\), freeway 8 safe).\n\nThe sequence achieves the goal in minimal turns \\(H = 11\\) with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 32: \\text{ } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: \\text{ } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 39: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 40: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 41: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 42: \\text{ } U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The current turn is t_1 = 34. The player moves up, down, or stays, changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right with constant speed. For left-moving cars, the span moves left as time increases; for right-moving, it moves right. Collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is within the span of some car at that turn.\n\nAlso, when you move to a new y, you're not on that freeway until the next turn, so you only check the freeway you're currently on for collisions.\n\nNow, the car states are given for each freeway k from 1 to 8.\n\nLet me list them clearly:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head 48, tail 83, direction left, speed 36. Since it's left-moving, head should be less than tail? No, the notation says for left-moving, span is [h, τ] and it moves left. But head 48, tail 83? That seems odd because 48 < 83, but if it's moving left, head should be the front, which for left-moving should be smaller x, but 48 < 83, so as it moves left, x decreases.\n\nIn the update: for left-moving, span [h, τ] becomes [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]. So at time t_1=34, position is given.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ, h] becomes [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt], so τ is the tail, h is head, with τ < h for right-moving.\n\nBut for freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36). Direction left, so head should be the left end? But 48 < 83, so if it's moving left, decreasing x, head at 48, tail at 83? That doesn't make sense because tail should be behind.\n\nPerhaps the head is always the front, so for left-moving, head is smaller x, tail larger; for right-moving, head is larger x, tail smaller.\n\nIn the description: for left-moving, span [h, τ] with h and τ such that it moves left. Similarly for right, [τ, h] with τ and h.\n\nBut in freeway 1, (48,83,left,36), so h=48, τ=83. Since left-moving, at t_1, span [48,83]. As time increases, h - sΔt and τ - sΔt, so both decrease, moving left.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same as 1: (48,83,left,36)\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, span should be [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) — but 48 and 37, if τ and h, which is which? It says (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nIn the table: Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor direction right, head should be larger than tail, I think.\n\nIn the update for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt], so τ + sΔt and h + sΔt, so τ must be less than h for it to make sense as [τ, h] moving right.\n\nSimilarly for left, [h, τ] with h and τ, moving left.\n\nIn freeway 3, first car: head 48, tail 37, direction right. But 48 > 37, so if right-moving, head at 48, tail at 37, so τ=37, h=48, span [37,48] at t_1.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,12), so head 12, tail 1, so τ=1, h=12, span [1,12]\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12), head -24, tail -35, so τ=-35, h=-24, span [-35,-24]\n\nAnd speed 12 for all.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 and 5 are identical to freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3, three cars with same parameters.\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (48,37,right,6) so head 48, tail 37, direction right, speed 6. So span [37,48] at t_1.\n\nFreeway 7: same as 6: (48,37,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (48,37,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: head 48, tail 37, right, speed 6, span [37,48]\n\nSecond car: head 0, tail -11, right, speed 6, span [-11,0] at t_1.\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,0) at turn t_1=34.\n\nI need to reach (0,9) as soon as possible.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars there, only freeways 1-8 have cars.\n\nThe minimal number of turns is at least 9, since from y=0 to y=9, moving up each time would take 9 turns, but there might be cars blocking, so I might need to wait or detour.\n\nBut moving down to y=0 is not possible since y=0 is the bottom, and we start there, so only up or stay.\n\ny starts at 0, we need to go to 9, so we must move up overall.\n\nEach action U increases y by 1, D decreases, S stays.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should move up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nI need to check for each freeway, when 0 is covered by a car span at a given turn.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in some car's span at turn T.\n\nSince the player moves at the same time, at turn T, after action, y_{T} is the position, and we check for that y_T freeway.\n\nAlso, when moving, if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, then at turn T, I am on y, so I check freeway y for collision at T. Then at turn T+1, I am on y+1, check that freeway.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions from t=34 onwards, to reach y=9.\n\nLet me denote the turn from current t_1=34.\n\nSet t=0 as the first turn, so at turn 0 (which is t_1=34), position y=0.\n\nThen at turn t (relative), position y_t.\n\nWe need y_H = 9 for some H, minimal H.\n\nAt each turn, after action, y_t is set, and we check collision on freeway y_t at that turn.\n\nIf I am on freeway k at turn t, and for that k, at time t_1 + t, 0 is in some car's span on freeway k.\n\nt_1 is absolute turn, but since we start at t_1, for relative turn t, absolute time is t_1 + t.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1=34, so at relative turn t, absolute time T = 34 + t.\n\nFor a freeway k, at absolute time T, the span of a car is computed.\n\nFor left-moving car: span at T is [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]\n\nSince at t_1, span is [h, τ], so at T, [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: at T, [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nCollision if player is on k at absolute time T, and 0 is in [low, high] for some car on k, where low and high are the span ends at T.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when 0 is covered.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but we only care at integer turns.\n\nAlso, for each freeway, multiple cars, so I need to find the times when 0 is occupied by any car.\n\nFirst, let's handle each freeway separately.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, left-moving, h=48, τ=83, s=36.\n\nAt absolute time T, span: [48 - 36(T - 34), 83 - 36(T - 34)]\n\nSet Δt = T - 34, relative turn.\n\nSo span: [48 - 36Δt, 83 - 36Δt]\n\n0 is in this interval if 48 - 36Δt <= 0 <= 83 - 36Δt\n\nSo 48 - 36Δt <= 0 and 0 <= 83 - 36Δt\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36Δt <= 0 => 48 <= 36Δt => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 83 - 36Δt => 36Δt <= 83 => Δt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSo Δt from ceil(1.333) to floor(2.305), since Δt integer.\n\nΔt >= 1.333, so Δt >= 2? Δt is integer, relative turn.\n\nΔt >= 2 since 1.333, ceil to 2? No.\n\n48 - 36Δt <= 0 for Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so for Δt >= 2, since Δt=1: 48-36=12 >0, not <=0\n\nAt Δt=1: 48-36(1) =12, 83-36=47, so [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nAt Δt=2: 48-72= -24, 83-72=11, so [-24,11], 0 is in since -24<=0<=11.\n\nAt Δt=3: 48-108= -60, 83-108= -25, [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at Δt=2, which is absolute time T=34+2=36, 0 is covered on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2, same as freeway 1: (48,83,left,36), so same thing, only at Δt=2, T=36, 0 covered.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars, all right-moving, speed 12.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) so head=48, tail=37? Direction right, so span at t_1: [τ, h] = [37,48] since τ=tail=37, h=head=48.\n\nAt T, [37 + 12Δt, 48 + 12Δt]\n\n0 in [37+12Δt, 48+12Δt] only if 37+12Δt <=0 <=48+12Δt, but 37+12Δt >0 for Δt>=0, so never <=0, so 0 not in this span ever.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,12), head=12, tail=1, span at t_1: [1,12]\n\nAt T: [1 + 12Δt, 12 + 12Δt], always positive for Δt>=0, so 0 not in.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12), head=-24, tail=-35, span at t_1: [-35,-24]? τ=tail=-35, h=head=-24, so [τ, h] = [-35,-24]\n\nAt T: [-35 + 12Δt, -24 + 12Δt]\n\n0 in this if -35 +12Δt <=0 <= -24 +12Δt\n\nFirst: -35+12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <=35 => Δt <= 35/12 ≈2.916\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +12Δt => 12Δt >=24 => Δt >=2\n\nSo Δt >=2 and Δt <=2.916, so Δt=2 and Δt=3? Δt=2: -35+24= -11 <=0, -24+24=0 <=0? 0 <=0 is true, but let's see.\n\nAt Δt=2: low = -35 + 12*2 = -35+24= -11, high= -24+24=0, so span [-11,0]\n\n0 is included, since high=0.\n\nSimilarly, at Δt=3: low= -35+36=1, high= -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nAt Δt=1: low= -35+12= -23, high= -24+12= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for third car, 0 covered at Δt=2, T=36.\n\nNow, for freeway 3, there are multiple cars, but only the third one covers 0 at Δt=2.\n\nFirst and second never cover 0, as spans are positive.\n\nSo freeway 3 has collision at Δt=2, T=36.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 and 5 are same as 3, so also collision at Δt=2.\n\nFreeway 4: identical to 3, so same, collision at Δt=2.\n\nFreeway 5 same.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car, (48,37,right,6), head=48, tail=37, direction right, so span at t_1: [37,48]\n\nAt T: [37 + 6Δt, 48 + 6Δt], always positive, so 0 never in span. So freeway 6 never has collision at 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: same as 6, (48,37,right,6), never collision at 0.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6), same as above, never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6), head=0, tail=-11, direction right.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [-11, 0] since τ=tail=-11, h=head=0.\n\nAt T: [-11 + 6Δt, 0 + 6Δt] = [-11 + 6Δt, 6Δt]\n\n0 in this span if -11 +6Δt <=0 <= 6Δt\n\nFirst: -11+6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=11 => Δt <= 11/6 ≈1.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= 6Δt => Δt >=0, always true for Δt>=0.\n\nSo for Δt=0,1? Δt=0: span [-11,0], 0 is included.\n\nΔt=0 is T=t_1=34.\n\nAt Δt=0: low=-11, high=0, so 0 in span.\n\nAt Δt=1: low=-11+6= -5, high=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=2: low=-11+12=1, high=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo at Δt=0 and Δt=1, T=34 and 35, 0 covered on freeway 8 by second car.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when 0 is covered (collision if player on that freeway at that relative turn):\n\nFreeway 1: collision at Δt=2 (T=36)\n\nFreeway 2: collision at Δt=2 (T=36)\n\nFreeway 3: collision at Δt=2 (T=36)\n\nFreeway 4: collision at Δt=2 (T=36)\n\nFreeway 5: collision at Δt=2 (T=36)\n\nFreeway 6: never collision\n\nFreeway 7: never collision\n\nFreeway 8: collision at Δt=0 (T=34) and Δt=1 (T=35)\n\nNote that at Δt=0, T=34, player is at y=0, which is not freeway 1-8, so freeway 8 collision at Δt=0 doesn't affect player since player not on freeway 8 at that time.\n\nSimilarly, at Δt=0, player on y=0, safe.\n\nThe collision times are only relevant if player is on that freeway.\n\nNow, player starts at y=0 at t=0 relative (T=34).\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible paths: since freeways 6 and 7 never have collision, they are always safe.\n\nFreeway 8 has collision at Δt=0 and Δt=1, but Δt=0 is now, player not on it, so for freeway 8, unsafe at relative turns 0 and 1? Relative turn t.\n\nAt relative turn t, absolute time T=34+t.\n\nFor freeway 8, unsafe when t=0 and t=1? t is the turn index from start.\n\nAt relative turn t, if player is on freeway k at that turn, and k has collision at that time.\n\nFor freeway 8, collision at t=0 (relative) and t=1.\n\nBut at t=0, player is at y=0, not on freeway 8, so no issue.\n\nAt t=1, if player is on freeway 8, then collision.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, collision at t=2.\n\nFreeway 6 and 7 always safe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, minimal turns is 9 if no delays.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If on freeway 8 at t=1 (relative turn 1, absolute 35), collision.\n\n- If on freeways 1,2,3,4,5 at t=2 (relative turn 2, absolute 36), collision.\n\nFreeways 6 and 7 always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nPlayer at t=0: y=0.\n\nWe need to choose actions: U, D, S each turn.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and need to go to y=9, and time is critical, probably best to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on bad positions at bad times.\n\nSpecifically, at relative turn 1 (t=1), if we are on y=8, which is freeway 8, then at that time, t=1, freeway 8 has collision, so we cannot be on y=8 at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, at relative turn 2 (t=2), we cannot be on freeways 1,2,3,4,5, i.e., y=1,2,3,4,5 at t=2.\n\nNow, let's list the y positions over time.\n\nSet t starting from 0.\n\nt=0: y=0, safe.\n\nNow, action a_0 for turn t_1+0 =34.\n\nThen t=1: y_1 = y_0 + Δy, based on a_0.\n\nSimilarly t=2, etc.\n\nWe need y_H =9 for some H.\n\nTo minimize H, start by trying to go up every turn.\n\nBut at t=1, if y=1, but y=1 is freeway 1, but at t=1, freeway 1 has no collision? Freeway 1 collision only at t=2.\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe only at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 unsafe at t=1.\n\nNow, if I go up at t=0: a_0 = U, then y_1 = 0 +1 =1.\n\nAt t=1, y=1, which is freeway 1.\n\nIs freeway 1 safe at t=1? From above, freeway 1 has collision only at t=2, not at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, Δt=1, for freeway 1: span [48-36(1), 83-36(1)] = [12,47], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same.\n\nNow, if I go up again at t=1: a_1 = U, y_2 =1+1=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=2, freeway 2.\n\nBut freeway 2 has collision at t=2, as we saw.\n\nAt t=2, Δt=2, freeway 2: span [48-72,83-72] = [-24,11], 0 in, so collision if on y=2 at t=2.\n\nSo if I do U at t=0 and U at t=1, then at t=2, y=2, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf at t=1, I don't go up, but stay or down.\n\nBut down to y=0 possible.\n\nSince freeways 6 and 7 are always safe, I could go to them quickly.\n\nBut y=6 and 7 are safe always.\n\nNow, minimal H: since from 0 to 9, at least 9 moves up, but I can stay or move down to avoid bad times, but that might increase turns.\n\nSince unsafe times are only at specific turns, I can delay or advance my position to avoid being there at that time.\n\nFor example, at t=2, I should not be on y=1,2,3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, at t=1, I should not be on y=8.\n\nNow, at t=0, y=0.\n\nI need to be at y=9 eventually.\n\nLet me list for each relative turn, which y are unsafe.\n\nAt relative turn t:\n\n- For t=1: unsafe on y=8 (freeway 8)\n\n- For t=2: unsafe on y=1,2,3,4,5 (freeways 1-5)\n\nFor other t, all y are safe? Freeways 6,7 always safe, freeway 8 unsafe only at t=0 and t=1, but t=0 player not on it, so only t=1 matters for y=8.\n\nFor t>=3, freeway 1: at t=3, Δt=3, span [-60,-25], 0 not in, and earlier only t=2, so safe for t>=3.\n\nSimilarly freeway 2 same.\n\nFreeway 3: collision only at t=2, so for t!=2 safe.\n\nSimilarly 4 and 5.\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at t=1 and t=0, but t=0 irrelevant, so only unsafe at t=1.\n\nFor t>=2, freeway 8: at t=2, span for second car [1,12], 0 not in, and later farther, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other times safe.\n\nSo summary:\n\n- At t=1: y=8 unsafe\n\n- At t=2: y=1,2,3,4,5 unsafe\n\n- At all other t, all y safe, including freeways 6,7 always.\n\nNow, we start at t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nTo minimize turns, we should move up as much as possible, but avoid being in unsafe states at t=1 and t=2.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At t=1, we should not be at y=8\n\n- At t=2, we should not be at y=1,2,3,4,5\n\nNow, at t=0: y=0\n\nAfter action a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy\n\nΔy = +1, -1, 0 for U, D, S.\n\ny must be integer 0 to 9.\n\nPossible actions at t=0:\n\n- If U: y_1 =1\n\n- If S: y_1=0\n\n- If D: y_1= -1, but y cannot be negative, so D not possible? y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0, D would make y_{t+1} = -1, not allowed, so action D invalid when y_t=0.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, U invalid.\n\nBut here y=0, so possible actions: U or S. D not allowed.\n\nSo a_0: U or S.\n\nCase 1: a_0 = U, then y_1 =1\n\nNow at t=1, y=1.\n\nWe need to choose a_1.\n\ny=1 at t=1.\n\nt=1 has unsafe only for y=8, so y=1 is safe at t=1.\n\nNow, if we go U at t=1, y_2=2, but at t=2, y=2 is unsafe (since y=2 in 1-5).\n\nSo collision.\n\nIf we go S at t=1, y_2=1, then at t=2, y=1 still, which is unsafe at t=2.\n\nIf we go D at t=1, y_2=0, then at t=2, y=0, which is safe, since y=0 no cars.\n\nBut we are at y=0 at t=2, which is far from 9.\n\nThen from there, we can go up, but it will take more turns.\n\nFor example, from t=2, y=0, we need to go to y=9, at least 9 more turns, total turns at least 11 or more.\n\nBut we can do better by not going up at t=0.\n\nCase 2: a_0 = S, then y_1=0\n\nAt t=1, y=0, safe.\n\nNow we need to choose a_1.\n\nPossible actions: U or S (D not allowed).\n\nIf U: y_2=1\n\nBut at t=2, y=1 is unsafe.\n\nIf S: y_2=0, still at 0, then later need to move.\n\nBut again, delays.\n\nAt t=1, y=0, we could go U to y=1 at t=2, but t=2 y=1 unsafe.\n\nSo we need to avoid being at y=1,2,3,4,5 at t=2.\n\nSince at t=1, if we are not at y=0, we might be at other places.\n\nAt t=1, if we are at y=1 (from a_0=U), or y=0 (from a_0=S).\n\nIf at t=1, y=0, then at t=2, if we go U, y_2=1, unsafe; if S, y_2=0, safe but delayed.\n\nIf at t=1, y=1 (from a_0=U), then at t=2, if we go down to y=0, safe but low.\n\nBut we can go to higher y at t=2.\n\nFor example, at t=1, if y=1, instead of U or S or D, we can go to y=0 or stay, but not up to 2.\n\ny_2 = y_1 + Δy, so from y=1, possible: U to 2, S to 1, D to 0.\n\nAll lead to y=0,1,2 at t=2, all of which are unsafe except y=0.\n\ny=0 is safe, y=1 and 2 unsafe at t=2.\n\nSo from y=1 at t=1, only way to be safe at t=2 is to go down to y=0 or stay at y=1 but unsafe, so only go down to y=0.\n\nThen at t=2, y=0.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=1, y=0, and we go up to y=1 at t=2, unsafe, or stay y=0.\n\nSo in both cases, to be safe at t=2, we need to be at y=0 at t=2, or y>=6 at t=2.\n\ny=6 and7 safe, y=8 might be issue but at t=2, y=8 is safe, since unsafe only at t=1 for y=8.\n\nSimilarly y=9 safe.\n\nSo at t=2, we can be at y=0,6,7,8,9 to be safe.\n\ny=9 possible if we move fast, but we start from 0.\n\nNow, at t=0, y=0.\n\nIf we do nothing, at t=1 y=0, then at t=2 we can be y=0 or y=1, but y=1 unsafe, so only y=0 possible safely.\n\nBut we can reach higher y.\n\nFor example, if at t=0, we stay, y_1=0.\n\nThen at t=1, we go up, but to where?\n\nAt t=1, y=0, we can go up to y=1, but at t=2, y=1 unsafe, so we cannot.\n\nWe can stay again at t=1, y_2=0 at t=2.\n\nBut then we are at y=0 at t=2.\n\nFrom there, we need to go to 9, at least 9 turns, so H at least 11? t=0 to t=2 is two turns, then from t=2 to t=2+H' with y_{2+H'}=9, H'>=9, so total turns from start H = 2 + H' >=11.\n\nBut we can be at higher y at t=2.\n\nFor example, at t=0, if we go up to y=1 at t=1, then at t=1, y=1, we go down to y=0 at t=2, so at t=2, y=0.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut we can go to y=6 or7 at t=2.\n\nHow? From t=0, we need to reach y=6 or7 in two turns.\n\nBut from y=0, after two actions, y can be: if U and U, y=2; U and S, y=1; U and D, y=0; S and U, y=1; S and S, y=0; etc. Maximum y=2 after two turns.\n\nCannot reach y=6 or7 in two turns from 0.\n\ny=0 at t=0.\n\nAfter one turn, t=1, y<=1\n\nAfter two turns, t=2, y<=2\n\nSo at t=2, possible y: 0,1,2 only.\n\nBut y=1 and2 unsafe at t=2, y=0 safe.\n\nSo inevitably, at t=2, we must be at y=0 to be safe, since we cannot be at y=6 or7.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 or9 impossible.\n\nSo the only safe position at t=2 is y=0.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=0 at t=2.\n\nNow, how to achieve that.\n\nAt t=0, y=0.\n\nIf a_0 = S, then y_1=0 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, a_1 = S, then y_2=0 at t=2.\n\nIf a_0 = U, y_1=1 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, a_1 = D, y_2=0 at t=2.\n\nIn both cases, we end up at y=0 at t=2.\n\nNow, from t=2 onwards, we need to go to y=9.\n\nBut we need to consider the unsafe at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, we have y=0 or y=1, both are not y=8, so safe at t=1, since only y=8 unsafe.\n\ny=0 and1 are fine at t=1.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, at t=2, we are at y=0.\n\nNow, from here, we can start moving up.\n\nBut freeways 6 and 7 are always safe, so we can go through them quickly.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal time from y=0 to y=9 is 9 turns, but we might need to avoid something, but from t=2 onwards, no unsafe times except we need to make sure not to be on y=8 at t=1, but t=1 is past, so from t=2, all times safe for all y, except that freeway 8 was unsafe at t=1, but t=1 is over, and for t>=2, freeway 8 safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways safe after t=2.\n\nSo from t=2, we can go up directly to y=9 in 9 turns.\n\ny at t=2 is 0.\n\nThen we can do U each turn from t=2 to t=10: y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 at t=3 to t=10? Let's see.\n\nt=2: y=0\n\nAfter action at t=2: a_2, y_3 = y_2 + Δy\n\nSet t=2: y=0\n\nt=3: after a_2, y_3\n\n...\n\ny at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action at turn t, y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t=2, we have y_2=0.\n\nNow, we perform action at turn t=2, which affects y at turn t=3.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nIf we go up every turn:\n\nStart t=2: y=0\n\na_2 = U, y_3 =1\n\na_3 = U, y_4 =2\n\na_4 = U, y_5 =3\n\na_5 = U, y_6 =4\n\na_6 = U, y_7 =5\n\na_7 = U, y_8 =6\n\na_8 = U, y_9 =7\n\na_9 = U, y_10=8\n\na_10= U, y_11=9\n\nSo at turn t=11 relative, y=9.\n\nBut we started from t=0, with two turns to reach t=2 at y=0.\n\nTotal turns: from t=0 to t=11, that's 12 actions? Let's index.\n\nRelative turns: t=0,1,2,3,...,H-1? We need the turn when y=9.\n\nAt turn t, y_t is position.\n\nAt turn t=0: y=0\n\nt=1: y_1\n\nt=2: y_2=0\n\nt=3: y_3=1 if U\n\n...\n\nt=10: y_10=8 if U at t=9\n\nt=11: y_11=9 if U at t=10\n\nSo y=9 at t=11.\n\nNumber of turns from start: H=11, since we go from t=0 to t=10 actions, y set at t=11.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from t=0 to t=10, 11 actions? No.\n\nThe actions are taken at turns t=0 to t=H-1, and after H actions, y_H is set.\n\nAt turn t, we take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}? Let's clarify.\n\nIn the game dynamics: \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nAnd \"at turn T, position y_T\"\n\nSo at turn T, position y_T, then after action a_T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t_1 + t, action a_{t_1 + t}.\n\nIn relative terms, at turn t (relative), position y_t, action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nWe need y_H =9 for some H.\n\nAt t=0, y_0=0.\n\nAfter H actions, y_H =9.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nIn the above, if we go directly, but with the delay, we have y_2=0, then y_11=9, so H=11.\n\nBut can we reach faster?\n\nEarlier at t=2, we must be at y=0, but from t=2 onwards, we go up, but we can go faster to safe freeways.\n\nFor example, freeways 6 and 7 are always safe, so we can go to y=6 or7 quickly and then up.\n\nBut from y=0 at t=2, to go to y=6, we need at least 6 actions: y_3=1, y_4=2, ..., y_8=6, then to y=9, three more, y_9=7,y_10=8,y_11=9, same as before.\n\nIf we go directly to y=6 at t=8, then y_9=7, etc., no saving.\n\nBut at t=2, y=0, we can stay or move, but moving up is better.\n\nAnother idea: at t=1, we can be at y=0 or1, but not higher.\n\nBut at t=1, if we are at y=1, and we go down to y=0 at t=2, same as before.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=6 at t=2, but impossible from start.\n\nt=0 to t=2 only two actions, y<=2.\n\nSo must be low at t=2.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11, with y_2=0, then up each turn to y_11=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to specify actions from t_1=34 onwards.\n\nFirst, how to get to y_2=0.\n\nWe have two options:\n\nOption A: a_0 = S, then y_1=0\n\nThen a_1 = S, y_2=0\n\nOption B: a_0 = U, y_1=1\n\nThen a_1 = D, y_2=0\n\nIn both cases, y_2=0.\n\nThen from there, a_2 to a_10 all U, y_3=1, y_4=2, ..., y_11=9.\n\nH=11, actions from t=0 to t=10.\n\nBut which option to choose? Either is fine, but perhaps we can save a turn or something.\n\nIn Option A, at t=1, we are at y=0, doing nothing.\n\nIn Option B, at t=1, we are at y=1, then go down.\n\nBut both end at y_2=0.\n\nFrom there same.\n\nBut in terms of actions, for minimal H, both take 11 turns to reach y=9.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose at t=2, y=0, we start moving.\n\nBut if we move faster, but we can only move one step per turn.\n\nUnless we stay less, but we need to go up 9 steps.\n\ny from 0 to 9, 9 steps up, each U increases y by 1, so need at least 9 U actions, and possibly some S or D, but D would decrease, so to minimize turns, we should avoid D and S, only U if possible.\n\nIn this case, from t=2 to t=11, we have 9 U actions, y from 0 to 9 in 9 steps, so minimal.\n\nBut we have two extra turns at the beginning to be safe at t=2.\n\nSo total 11 turns.\n\nBut is there a way to have y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if we could be at higher y at t=2, but we can't.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to be at y=0 at t=2; we could be at y=6 or7 at t=2, but impossible.\n\nAnother thought: at t=1, we are at y=0 or1.\n\nBut at t=1, if we are at y=0, and we could go to y=6 immediately, but no, only one step.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps the unsafe at t=2 only affects if we are on those y, but we can be on y=6 at t=2, but we can't reach it.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nWe need to output the sequence from turn t_1=34.\n\nRelative t=0: turn 34\n\nt=1: turn 35\n\nt=2: turn 36\n\netc.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at each turn.\n\nFirst, for the first two turns, we need to have y_2=0.\n\nOption: either stay at 34 and stay at 35, or up at 34 and down at 35.\n\nNow, in terms of the car at freeway 8 at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, relative, absolute turn 35.\n\nFreeway 8 has collision at Δt=1, T=35.\n\nBut if player is on y=8 at t=1, collision.\n\nBut in our case, at t=1, we are at y=0 or1, not 8, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=2, absolute 36, freeways 1-5 have collision, but if we are at y=0, not on them.\n\nThen from t=2 onwards, no issue.\n\nNow, for the sequence, let's choose one, say Option A: stay at turn 34 and turn 35.\n\nThen at turn 36 (t=2), we start going up.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 34: S  (since a_0=S, y_1=0)\n\nTurn 35: S  (a_1=S, y_2=0)\n\nNow turn 36: U, so y_3=1 at turn 37? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 34 (t=0): action a_{34}, after action, y at turn 35 is set.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn T, we take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nGiven: at turn t_1=34, position (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0)\n\nSo at turn 34, we take action a_{34}, then y_{35} = y_{34} + Δy\n\nSimilarly, at turn 35, action a_{35}, y_{36} = y_{35} + Δy, and so on.\n\nPosition y_T is at turn T.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn T, we output action a_T.\n\nWe need y_T =9 for some T.\n\nStart: at turn 34, y_{34}=0.\n\nAfter action a_{34}, y_{35} = 0 + Δy\n\nSimilarly.\n\nWe need to find min T such that y_T=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, we specify a_{34}, a_{35}, ..., up to a_{T-1} for y_T=9? Let's see.\n\nAfter action at turn T-1, y_T is set.\n\nSo to have y_T=9, we need actions from turn 34 to turn T-1, that's T - 34 actions? Number of actions.\n\nSet the turn when we reach y=9.\n\nSuppose at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nThen actions from turn 34 to turn T-1 determine the moves.\n\nNumber of actions: from 34 to T-1, that's (T-1) - 34 + 1 = T - 34 actions? Turns from 34 to T-1 inclusive, number is (T-1) - 34 + 1 = T - 34.\n\nFor example, if T=34, y_{34}=0, not 9.\n\nTo reach at T=35, y_{35}=9, which requires from y_{34}=0 to y_{35}=9, impossible in one action, since |Δy|<=1.\n\nSimilarly, minimal T is 34 + 9 = 43 if we go up each turn, but with cars, we have delay.\n\nIn our case, with the safe path.\n\nBack to relative.\n\nSet t such that turn 34 + t.\n\nAt turn 34 + t, position y_t.\n\nBetter to use absolute or relative.\n\nI think relative is easier.\n\nSet t=0 for turn 34.\n\ny_0 = 0\n\nAt turn 34+t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t at turn 34+t.\n\nThen y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nWe need y_H = 9 for some H.\n\nMin H.\n\nFrom above, with y_2=0, then y_3=1, y_4=2, ..., y_11=9, so H=11.\n\ny_11=9 at turn 34+11=45.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=10.\n\na_0 to a_10.\n\nFor the first part, to have y_2=0.\n\ny_0=0\n\nIf a_0=S, y_1=0\n\nIf a_0=U, y_1=1\n\nThen y_2 = y_1 + Δy_1\n\nIf y_1=0, then a_1=S or U, y_2=0 or1\n\nBut we want y_2=0, so if y_1=0, a_1=S, y_2=0\n\nIf y_1=1, a_1=D, y_2=0\n\nIn both cases, we can have y_2=0.\n\nThen a_2=U, y_3=1\n\na_3=U, y_4=2\n\na_4=U, y_5=3\n\na_5=U, y_6=4\n\na_6=U, y_7=5\n\na_7=U, y_8=6\n\na_8=U, y_9=7\n\na_9=U, y_10=8\n\na_10=U, y_11=9\n\nSo H=11, y at turn 34+11=45.\n\nActions: a_0 to a_10: for example, all S for first two, then U.\n\nOr U then D, then U.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to output for each turn.\n\nNow, for freeway 8, at t=1 (turn 35), if we are on y=8, collision, but we are at y=0 or1, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=2 (turn 36), on y=1,2,3,4,5 collision, but we at y=0.\n\nThen later, when we go through y=1 to 5, it is after t=2, so safe, since no collision times.\n\nFor example, at turn 37 (t=3 relative), y=1, freeway 1.\n\nAt t=3, Δt=3, freeway 1: [48-36*3,83-36*3]=[48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same.\n\nFreeway 3: at t=3, Δt=3, for the car that was at [-35,-24], now [-35+36, -24+36]= [1,12]? Absolute time T=34+3=37, Δt=3.\n\nFreeway 3, third car: at T, [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-35 + 12*3, -24 + 12*3] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, other cars not cover 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 8 at later times, say at t=10, y=8, turn 44.\n\nAt T=44, Δt=10, freeway 8 second car: [ -11 + 6*10, 0 + 60] = [-11+60, 60] = [49,60], not 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThus the path is safe.\n\nNow, minimal H: is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose y_10=9.\n\nThen from y_0=0 to y_10=9 in 10 steps, so must have 9 U and 1 other action, but since we start from 0, and go to 9, net +9, so must have 9 U and 0 S or D? If we have S or D, we need more U, so to have exactly 9 steps up, we need exactly 9 U actions, and if H=10, we have 10 actions, so one S or D.\n\nBut with S or D, we stay or go down, so y increases slower.\n\nFor example, if we do one S somewhere, y increases later.\n\nBut in this case, we need to be safe at t=1 and t=2.\n\nAt t=1, we must not be at y=8, but since y<=1 at t=1, not possible to be at y=8.\n\nAt t=2, we must not be at y=1,2,3,4,5.\n\nAt t=2, y_2, since from t=0, after two actions, y_2 <=2, so y_2=0,1,2.\n\ny_2=1 or 2 unsafe, only y_2=0 safe.\n\nSo we must have y_2=0.\n\nTo have y_2=0, with two actions from y_0=0.\n\nIf we do two S: y_1=0, y_2=0\n\nOr U then D: y_1=1, y_2=0\n\nIn both cases, we have one non-U action.\n\nThen from y_2=0 to y_10=9, that is 8 steps, but y from 0 to 9, need 9 increases, so in 8 actions from t=2 to t=9? Actions from t=2 to t=9 determine y_3 to y_10.\n\ny_2 at t=2, after action a_2, y_3, etc.\n\ny_2=0\n\nThen to have y_10=9, we need y_10 = y_2 + sum_{i=2 to 9} Δy_i = 0 + sum of 8 actions =9.\n\nSo sum of Δy from i=2 to 9 (8 actions) must be +9, but each Δy <=1, so max sum=8, cannot be 9. Contradiction.\n\nThus impossible to have y_10=9.\n\nSimilarly, for any earlier.\n\ny_H=9, with H=10, then from y_0=0 to y_10=9, number of actions: from turn 34 to 43, actions at 34 to 42? y at turn T.\n\ny_0 at turn 34.\n\ny_1 at turn 35, ..., y_H at turn 34+H.\n\nSet turn when y=9 is K, so y_K=9.\n\nThen actions from turn 34 to K-1.\n\nNumber of actions: K - 34.\n\ny_K = y_0 + sum_{i=0 to K-1} Δy_i\n\ny_0=0, y_K=9, so sum_{i=0 to K-1} Δy_i =9\n\nEach Δy_i >= -1, but to minimize K, we want Δy_i =1 as much as possible.\n\nBut sum=9, so we need at least 9 actions where Δy=1, and possibly some with 0 or -1, but with 0 or -1, we need more actions.\n\nMinimal K is when all Δy=1 for 9 actions, but with K-34 actions.\n\ny_K = y_0 + sum_{t=0 to K-1} Δy_t =9\n\nSince y_0=0.\n\nNumber of terms: from t=0 to K-1, that's K terms? Indices.\n\ny_K = y_0 + Δy_0 + Δy_1 + ... + Δy_{K-1}\n\nThe sum has K terms: Δy_0 to Δy_{K-1}\n\nEach between -1 and 1.\n\nSum =9.\n\nThus K >=9, and if all Δy=1, K=9, y_9=9.\n\nBut with constraints, we have to have some non-up moves.\n\nIn our case, to be safe, we need y_2=0.\n\ny_2 = y_0 + Δy_0 + Δy_1\n\nSince y_0=0, y_2 = Δy_0 + Δy_1\n\nWe need y_2=0.\n\nSo Δy_0 + Δy_1 =0\n\nNow, Δy_0 and Δy_1 each in {-1,0,1}, but since y_0=0, Δy_0 cannot be -1, so Δy_0 =0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, if y_1=0, Δy_1=0 or 1; if y_1=1, Δy_1= -1,0,1.\n\nBut y_2=0.\n\nCases:\n\n- If Δy_0=0, then y_1=0, then Δy_1 must be 0 to have y_2=0.\n\n- If Δy_0=1, then y_1=1, then Δy_1 must be -1 to have y_2=0.\n\nSo either (Δy_0=0, Δy_1=0) or (Δy_0=1, Δy_1=-1)\n\nIn both cases, the sum of the first two Δy is 0.\n\nThen for y_K=9, we need sum_{i=0 to K-1} Δy_i =9\n\nBut sum_{i=0 to K-1} Δy_i = Δy_0 + Δy_1 + sum_{i=2 to K-1} Δy_i = 0 + sum_{i=2 to K-1} Δy_i\n\nNow, sum_{i=2 to K-1} Δy_i must be 9.\n\nThe indices i from 2 to K-1, that's (K-1) - 2 + 1 = K-2 terms.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so sum <= K-2.\n\nThus 9 <= K-2, so K >=11.\n\nAnd with K=11, we can have sum_{i=2 to 10} Δy_i =9, with all Δy_i=1 for i=2 to10.\n\nThus minimal K=11, turn 34+11=45.\n\nActions from turn 34 to 44? y_K at turn 34+K.\n\ny_11 at turn 34+11=45.\n\nActions at turn 34 to 44, that's 11 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to output actions for turn 34 to turn 44.\n\nNow, for the first two actions, we can choose:\n\nEither: a_{34} = S, a_{35} = S\n\nOr: a_{34} = U, a_{35} = D\n\nThen a_{36} to a_{44} all U.\n\nIn the second option, at turn 35, we do D, but y at turn 35 is y_1=1 (if a_{34}=U), then a_{35}=D, so y_{36}=0.\n\nBut at turn 35, we are on y=1, which is freeway 1, but at absolute turn 35, which is relative t=1, Δt=1, freeway 1: [48-36,83-36]=[12,47], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBoth sequences are valid.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the sequence.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 8 has a car at (0,-11,right,6) at t_1, which at Δt=0, span [-11,0], includes 0, but at turn 34, player not on freeway 8, so fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, output the sequence.\n\nLet me choose the first option: stay at 34 and 35.\n\nThen:\n\nTurn 34: S\n\nTurn 35: S\n\nThen Turn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nAfter a_{44}=U, y_{45}=9.\n\nActions from turn 34 to 44.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the answer should be for turns starting from t_1=34.\n\nIn the format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 34: a_{34}\nTurn 35: a_{35}\n...\n}\n\nUp to the last action before reaching, but we need to specify until the action that leads to y=9.\n\nAfter a_{44}, y_{45}=9, so actions from 34 to 44.\n\nNumber of actions: 11.\n\nWe can write the sequence.\n\nIn the second option: Turn 34: U, Turn 35: D, then Turn 36: U, ..., Turn 44: U.\n\nSame number.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nBut in the stay option, we do nothing for two turns, might be simpler.\n\nNow, but let's confirm if at turn 36, when we go to y=1.\n\nTurn 36: action a_{36}, which sets y_{37}.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 36: U, so y_{37}=1.\n\nAt turn 37, y=1, freeway 1, absolute time 37, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can start going up earlier, but we cannot avoid the initial delay.\n\nAnother idea: at t=2, we are at y=0, but we can go to y=6 faster? No, still need 6 steps to y=6.\n\nFor example, if we go up every time from t=2, y_3=1, ..., y_8=6 at turn 42, then y_9=7, y_10=8, y_11=9 at turn 45, same.\n\nNo shortcut.\n\nThus minimal H=11.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nFor the answer, I'll use the stay-first approach.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 34: S\n\nTurn 35: S\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nAfter Turn 44 action, y at Turn 45 is 9.\n\nIn the box, we list actions from Turn 34 to Turn 44.\n\nThe format says: a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, but H is number of actions? In the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"minimal number of turns H\", but H here might be the number of actions.\n\nIn the task: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"after H actions, y_{t_1 + H} =9\" or something.\n\nFrom the dynamics: after actions from t=0 to H-1, y_H =9.\n\nIn relative: after actions a_0 to a_{H-1}, y_H =9.\n\nWith H=11, y_{11}=9.\n\nActions a_0 to a_{10}.\n\nFor absolute: actions at turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so turn 34 to 34+10=44.\n\nThen y at turn 35 to 45, with y_{45}=9.\n\nt_1 + H =34 +11=45, y_{45}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo sequence: for t from 0 to 10, turn 34+t, action a_t.\n\nIn the output, we list each turn.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 34: S  (a_0)\n\nTurn 35: S  (a_1)\n\nTurn 36: U  (a_2)\n\nTurn 37: U  (a_3)\n\nTurn 38: U  (a_4)\n\nTurn 39: U  (a_5)\n\nTurn 40: U  (a_6)\n\nTurn 41: U  (a_7)\n\nTurn 42: U  (a_8)\n\nTurn 43: U  (a_9)\n\nTurn 44: U  (a_{10})\n\nThen y_{45}=9.\n\nIn the box.\n\nTo write it neatly.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 34\\) is 11. This requires a sequence of actions that avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) at specific unsafe times.\n\n### Unsafe Conditions:\n- At relative turn \\(t = 1\\) (absolute turn 35), freeway \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe due to a car collision at position 0.\n- At relative turn \\(t = 2\\) (absolute turn 36), freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\) are unsafe due to car collisions at position 0.\n- All other times and freeways are safe, including freeways \\(y = 6\\) and \\(y = 7\\), which are always safe.\n\n### Strategy:\n- To avoid the unsafe conditions, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at relative turn \\(t = 2\\) (absolute turn 36). This is achieved by either:\n  - Staying at \\(y = 0\\) for the first two turns (actions: S, S), or\n  - Moving up to \\(y = 1\\) at \\(t = 0\\) and then down to \\(y = 0\\) at \\(t = 1\\) (actions: U, D).\n- After reaching \\(y = 0\\) at \\(t = 2\\), move up (U) every turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) in the minimal number of turns, as there are no further unsafe conditions.\n\nBoth sequences achieve \\(y = 9\\) at absolute turn 45 (relative turn \\(t = 11\\)) with \\(H = 11\\) turns. The sequence using \"S, S\" for the first two actions is chosen for simplicity.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions are taken from turn 34 to turn 44, resulting in \\(y = 9\\) at turn 45.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 34: S \\\\\nTurn 35: S \\\\\nTurn 36: U \\\\\nTurn 37: U \\\\\nTurn 38: U \\\\\nTurn 39: U \\\\\nTurn 40: U \\\\\nTurn 41: U \\\\\nTurn 42: U \\\\\nTurn 43: U \\\\\nTurn 44: U\n}",

Each freeway has cars that move either left (decreasing x) or right (increasing x) at constant speed. \nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is at some freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the car on that freeway has a span that includes x=0 at that exact turn.\n\nImportant: When moving from y to y' at turn T, note that at turn T the player is still on y (and then moves to y' at the next turn). So:\n- At turn T, the player is at y_T, and we check for collision on freeway y_T at turn T.\n- If the action at turn T is U (or D), then at turn T+1 the player will be at y_{T+1} = y_T + 1 (or -1). But at turn T, the player is at y_T.\n\nWe start at turn 38 at (0,0). We cannot be at freeway 0? Actually, the initial position is (0,0) and we are not on any freeway? \nBut note: freeways are from y=1 to y=8. The player starts at y=0 (which is safe) and must end at y=9 (which is also safe, since no freeway at y=9). \nThe movement: we can only move to y=1 by going up from y=0, then to y=2, etc.\n\nGoal: minimal H and a sequence of actions from turn 38 to turn 38+H-1 such that at the end of the sequence, we are at y=9.\n\nConstraints: at each turn t (from 38 to 38+H-1) we must avoid being on a freeway row (y from 1 to 8) at a moment when a car on that row has a span that includes 0 at that turn.\n\nWe are to output the actions for turns starting at 38: \nTurn 38: a_38\nTurn 39: a_39\n...\nuntil the turn when we first reach y=9.\n\nHow to compute the car positions at future turns?\n\nFor a car at freeway k at turn t1 (current turn 38) with (head, tail, direction, speed) = (h, tau, d, s). \nNote: the representation for left-moving: the car span at t1 is [h, tau] (with h > tau, because moving left, so head is at the right and moving left) and for right-moving: [tau, h] (with tau < h).\n\nBut note the given data:\n\nFor freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36) -> this is left-moving. So at turn 38, the car spans from 48 to 83? \nBut wait: if it's moving left, then the head (which is the front) should be at the right? Actually, the representation says:\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> and then at T, [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. \nBut note: if the car is moving left, then the entire car moves left. So if at t1 the car is from x=48 to x=83, then that's a length of 36? 83-48+1=36? Actually, no, the length is |h-tau|+1? But 83-48+1=36, and the speed is 36? That seems odd.\n\nWait, the car on freeway 1: (48,83,left,36). The span is [48,83] at turn 38? Then at a future turn T, the car will be at [48 - 36*(T-38), 83 - 36*(T-38)].\n\nBut note: the car might be long? The length of the car is 83-48+1 = 36? And the speed is 36 per turn? That is, it moves one full car length per turn? That is very fast.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 3,4,5: they have multiple cars? The table says:\nFreeway 3: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nBut for a right-moving car, the representation is [tau, h] meaning [tail, head]? Actually, the update rule says:\nRight-moving: [Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for the first car on freeway 3: at t1=38, it is [37,48] (since it says (48,37,right,12) but wait: the table says head=48, tail=37? \nBut for right-moving, the head is the front, which is at the right, so head=48, tail=37? Then the span is [37,48] at turn 38? Then at T, it becomes [37+12*(T-38), 48+12*(T-38)].\n\nSimilarly, the second car: (12,1,right,12) -> span [1,12] at turn 38, then [1+12*(T-38), 12+12*(T-38)].\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12) -> span [-35,-24] at turn 38, then [-35+12*(T-38), -24+12*(T-38)].\n\nBut note: the problem says that collision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on freeway k and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe must check for each freeway we step on, at the exact turn we are on that freeway, that no car on that freeway has a span that includes 0.\n\nHow to plan?\n\nWe want to go from y=0 to y=9. The minimal number of turns is at least 9 (if we go up every turn). But we might have to wait (by using S or even D) to avoid collisions.\n\nWe need to simulate the movement and check for collisions at each step.\n\nWe'll consider states: (turn, y). We start at (38,0). We can take actions: U, D, S. But note: we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe wish to reach y=9 as soon as possible. So we can use BFS (since the grid is small: turns might go up to 38+? and y in [0,9]). But note: the car positions change with time, so we must compute for each freeway and each turn the set of x where there is a car.\n\nHowever, note that the cars move continuously and the spans are linear in time. For a given freeway k and a turn T, we can compute the set of cars that are present at that freeway and check if any car's span includes 0.\n\nBut note: we are only concerned with freeways 1 to 8 and at the exact turn T when the player is on that freeway.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k and for each turn T (starting from 38) whether the freeway k is safe at turn T (i.e., no car at freeway k has a span that includes 0 at turn T).\n\nHow to compute for a car on freeway k:\n\nFor a left-moving car: (h, tau, left, s) -> at turn T, the span is [h - s*(T-38), tau - s*(T-38)].\nWe require that 0 is not in [h - s*(T-38), tau - s*(T-38)]? \nBut note: for a left-moving car, the head is at the right, so the span is [h - s*(T-38), tau - s*(T-38)] and since the car is moving left, h - s*(T-38) > tau - s*(T-38). So the interval is [tau - s*(T-38), h - s*(T-38)]? \nWait, the problem says: for left-moving, the span at T is [h - s*(T-38), tau - s*(T-38)]. But if h>tau, then h - s*(T-38) > tau - s*(T-38) only if s*(T-38) is not too large? Actually, the representation is that the head is at h and the tail at tau, and since the car is moving left, both decrease. But the interval is from the tail to the head? \n\nActually, the problem states: \nLeft-moving: Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\nBut if the car is moving left, then the tail is at the left? So the tail should be the leftmost point? Then the span should be [tau - s*(T-t1), h - s*(T-t1)]? \nBut the problem writes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] and says \"tail\" is tau? \n\nWait, in the initial state for freeway 1: (48,83,left,36) -> and they write head=48, tail=83? That would be a car that is from 48 to 83? Then head=48 (the left end) and tail=83 (the right end)? But then moving left, the head (left end) moves left? \n\nBut the update rule: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] -> so at T=38: [48, 83] becomes [48,83]? Then at T=39: [48-36, 83-36] = [12,47]. \n\nBut then the car is from 12 to 47? So the head (which was at 48) moves to 12? That's a big jump. \n\nAlternatively, if we interpret the car as having head at 83 and tail at 48? Then moving left, the head (at 83) moves to 83-36=47, and the tail (at 48) moves to 12? Then the car is from 12 to 47? That makes sense. \n\nBut the problem states: for left-moving: \"head\" is h, tail is tau, and the span at t1 is [h, tau]. But if h=48 and tau=83, then [48,83] is an interval that goes from 48 to 83? But then moving left, the entire interval shifts left. \n\nSo the car covers the interval [48,83] at t1. Then at t1+1, it covers [48-36, 83-36] = [12,47]. \n\nSimilarly, for a right-moving car: (head, tail, right, speed) -> the span at t1 is [tau, head]? But the example: (48,37,right,12) -> so head=48, tail=37? Then the span at t1 is [37,48]? Then at T, [37+12*(T-38), 48+12*(T-38)].\n\nSo we'll compute for each freeway k and each turn T (relative to 38) the set of intervals that the cars cover and check if 0 is in any of them.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k and for each turn T (starting from 38 to, say, 38+20, because minimal steps are 9, but we might have to wait) whether the freeway is safe (i.e., 0 is not covered by any car on that freeway at turn T).\n\nLet t0 = 38.\n\nFor freeway 1:\n  Car: (h=48, tau=83, left, s=36) -> span at T: [48-36*(T-t0), 83-36*(T-t0)]\n  We need to check if 0 is in [48-36*(T-t0), 83-36*(T-t0)].\n  Solve: 48-36*(T-t0) <= 0 <= 83-36*(T-t0) \n  => \n    48 - 36*(T-t0) <= 0  => 36*(T-t0) >= 48 => T-t0 >= 48/36 = 4/3 => T-t0 >= 2 (since integer)\n    and 0 <= 83-36*(T-t0) => 36*(T-t0) <= 83 => T-t0 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 => T-t0 <= 2.\n\n  So only at T-t0=2: \n    [48-36*2, 83-36*2] = [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11] -> 0 is in [-24,11] -> unsafe at T=40.\n\n  At T-t0=1: [48-36, 83-36] = [12,47] -> 0 not in [12,47] -> safe.\n  At T-t0=0: [48,83] -> safe.\n  At T-t0=3: [48-108, 83-108] = [-60,-25] -> 0 not in.\n\n  So freeway 1 is unsafe only at T=40 (relative turn 2).\n\nFor freeway 2: same as freeway 1? \n  Car: (48,83,left,36) -> same as above: unsafe only at T=40.\n\nFor freeway 3: \n  Cars: \n    Car1: (48,37,right,12) -> span at T: [37+12*(T-t0), 48+12*(T-t0)]\n    Check 0 in [37+12*(T-t0), 48+12*(T-t0)]:\n        37+12*(T-t0) <= 0 <= 48+12*(T-t0)\n        => \n          37+12*(T-t0) <= 0 -> 12*(T-t0) <= -37 -> T-t0 <= -37/12 (negative) -> impossible.\n\n        So car1 never covers 0.\n\n    Car2: (12,1,right,12) -> span [1+12*(T-t0), 12+12*(T-t0)]\n        Check: 1+12*(T-t0) <= 0 <= 12+12*(T-t0)\n        => \n          First: 1+12*(T-t0) <= 0 -> 12*(T-t0) <= -1 -> T-t0 <= -1 -> impossible.\n\n    Car3: (-24,-35,right,12) -> span [-35+12*(T-t0), -24+12*(T-t0)]\n        Check: -35+12*(T-t0) <= 0 <= -24+12*(T-t0)\n        => \n          0 <= -24+12*(T-t0) -> 12*(T-t0) >= 24 -> T-t0 >= 2.\n          and -35+12*(T-t0) <= 0 -> 12*(T-t0) <= 35 -> T-t0 <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916 -> so T-t0=2,3.\n\n        At T-t0=2: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in [-11,0]? Yes, because the interval is [-11,0] (if inclusive). So unsafe at T=40.\n        At T-t0=3: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        So freeway 3 is unsafe at T=40 (relative turn 2).\n\nFor freeway 4: same as freeway 3? \n  The cars are identical: so unsafe at T=40.\n\nFor freeway 5: same as freeway 3 and 4: unsafe at T=40.\n\nFor freeway 6:\n  Car: (48,37,right,6) -> span [37+6*(T-t0), 48+6*(T-t0)]\n        Check: 37+6*(T-t0) <= 0 <= 48+6*(T-t0)\n        37+6*(T-t0) <= 0 -> 6*(T-t0) <= -37 -> impossible.\n\n        So safe at all times.\n\nFor freeway 7:\n  Same as freeway 6: safe at all times.\n\nFor freeway 8:\n  Cars: \n      Car1: (48,37,right,6) -> same as above: safe at all times.\n      Car2: (0,-11,right,6) -> span [-11+6*(T-t0), 0+6*(T-t0)] = [-11+6*(T-t0), 6*(T-t0)]\n        Check: -11+6*(T-t0) <= 0 <= 6*(T-t0)\n        => \n          0 <= 6*(T-t0) -> T-t0 >= 0 (always true for T>=t0)\n          and -11+6*(T-t0) <= 0 -> 6*(T-t0) <= 11 -> T-t0 <= 11/6 ≈ 1.833 -> so T-t0=0,1.\n\n        At T-t0=0: [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Yes, because the interval is [-11,0] and 0 is the right endpoint. \n          So unsafe at T=38 (relative 0) and T=39 (relative 1).\n\n        Specifically:\n          T=t0: [ -11, 0 ] -> includes 0 -> unsafe at T=38.\n          T=t0+1: [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6] -> includes 0 -> unsafe at T=39.\n          T=t0+2: [-11+12,12] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        So freeway 8 is unsafe at T=38 and T=39, but safe from T=40 onward.\n\nSummary of unsafe freeway-times:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=40\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=40\nFreeway 3: unsafe at T=40\nFreeway 4: unsafe at T=40\nFreeway 5: unsafe at T=40\nFreeway 6: safe at all T\nFreeway 7: safe at all T\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=38,39 -> safe for T>=40.\n\nWe start at turn 38 at y=0.\n\nWe wish to go to y=9. The minimal path would be to go up every turn: \n  Turn38: U -> y=1 at turn39? \n  But note: at turn38, we are at y=0. We take an action at turn38: \n      if a38=U: then at turn39, we will be at y=1.\n      However, at turn38, we are at y=0 (safe) and then we move to y=1 at turn39.\n\nBut we must avoid being on a freeway at a turn when it is unsafe.\n\nWe are at:\n  Turn38: y=0 -> safe (not a freeway)\n  Turn39: if we moved to y=1 at turn39 -> then we are on freeway1 at turn39. \n        Freeway1: we found it is safe at T=39 (only unsafe at T=40) -> so safe.\n\nBut then at turn40, we would be at y=2? Then at turn40, we are on freeway2 at T=40 -> unsafe! \n\nSo if we go:\n  38: U -> at turn39: y=1 (safe, since freeway1 safe at T=39)\n  39: U -> at turn40: y=2 -> freeway2 at T=40 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot do that.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway2 at T=40.\n\nWe have to wait at some positions to skip the unsafe turn.\n\nWe can consider:\n  Option 1: Wait at y=0 for one turn? \n      Turn38: S -> then at turn39: still at y=0 (safe).\n      Then at turn39: U -> at turn40: y=1 -> freeway1 at T=40 -> unsafe? \n          But freeway1 is unsafe at T=40? Yes, so that's unsafe.\n\n  Option 2: Wait at y=0 for two turns? \n      Turn38: S -> turn39: y=0\n      Turn39: S -> turn40: y=0\n      Then turn40: U -> turn41: y=1 -> freeway1 at T=41: safe (since freeway1 only unsafe at T=40).\n      Then we can proceed: \n          turn41: U -> turn42: y=2 -> freeway2 at T=42: safe (only unsafe at T=40).\n          and so on.\n\n  This takes 9 steps (from turn40 to turn48: 8 ups) to get from y=0 to y=9? \n      Actually: \n        Turn40: U -> y=1 at turn41\n        Turn41: U -> y=2 at turn42\n        Turn42: U -> y=3 at turn43\n        Turn43: U -> y=4 at turn44\n        Turn44: U -> y=5 at turn45\n        Turn45: U -> y=6 at turn46\n        Turn46: U -> y=7 at turn47\n        Turn47: U -> y=8 at turn48\n        Turn48: U -> y=9 at turn49 -> done.\n\n      Total turns: from turn38 to turn49: 12 actions? \n        Actions: \n          38: S\n          39: S\n          40: U\n          41: U\n          42: U\n          43: U\n          44: U\n          45: U\n          46: U\n          47: U\n          48: U -> then at turn49 we are at y=9.\n\n      H = 12.\n\nBut we can do better? \n\nAlternatively, we can go up to y=3 and then wait? \n\nBut note freeway3 is unsafe at T=40. So if we are on freeway3 (y=3) at T=40, that's unsafe.\n\nWe must avoid being on any freeway 1-8 at T=40.\n\nSo we can be at y=0, or y=9 (but we are not at y=9 yet) at T=40.\n\nWe can try to get to a safe freeway at T=40? But freeways 6 and 7 are safe at all times. So if we can be at freeway6 (y=6) at T=40, that would be safe.\n\nBut how? \n  We start at y=0 at T=38.\n  We have two moves: T38 and T39 to get to y=6? \n      That would require 6 steps? But we have only two moves -> impossible.\n\nWe can get to y=6 in 6 moves? Then we would be at T=38+6=44? \n\nBut we wish to avoid T=40 on the unsafe freeways.\n\nAlternatively, we can go up to y=5 (freeway5) at T=39? \n  How: \n    T38: U -> y=1 at T39 -> safe (freeway1 safe at T39)\n    T39: U -> y=2 at T40 -> unsafe (freeway2 at T40) -> not allowed.\n\nWait, so we cannot be at freeway2 at T40. \n\nBut what if we go up to y=3 by T40? \n  T38: U -> T39: y=1 (safe)\n  T39: U -> T40: y=2 -> unsafe -> not allowed.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeway1-5 and 8 at T=40? Actually, freeway8 is safe at T=40? \n  Freeway8: unsafe at T=38,39 -> safe at T=40 and beyond.\n\nSo we can be on freeway6,7,8 at T=40? \n\nBut we start at y=0. We need to get to y=6,7, or 8 at T=40.\n\nHow many moves to get to y=6? 6 moves. But we have 2 moves (T38 and T39) -> only 2 moves: we can go to at most y=2.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=6 at T=40.\n\nTherefore, the only safe position at T=40 is y=0 (we started there) or y=9 (but we can't get to 9 in 2 moves) or we can be in the air? But we are on a freeway if we are in y=1..8.\n\nSo the only safe position at T=40 is y=0? \n\nBut if we are at y=0 at T=40, then we are safe (since not on freeway). \n\nSo we must be at y=0 at T=40.\n\nWe start at T=38 at y=0. \n  We can do:\n    T38: S -> T39: y=0\n    T39: S -> T40: y=0 -> safe.\n\nThen we can start moving.\n\nBut we have to get to y=9. From T40 at y=0, we need at least 9 moves (each U increases by 1). \n\nSo:\n  T40: U -> T41: y=1 -> freeway1 at T41: safe? \n        freeway1: we computed unsafe only at T40 -> so T41 is safe.\n  T41: U -> T42: y=2 -> freeway2 at T42: safe (only unsafe at T40).\n  T42: U -> T43: y=3 -> freeway3 at T43: safe (only unsafe at T40? but freeway3 had a car that was unsafe at T40, but at T43: \n        freeway3: \n          car3: at T43: [-35+12*(43-38), -24+12*(43-38)] = [-35+60, -24+60] = [25,36] -> safe.\n        and the other cars are safe as well? \n          car1: [37+12*5, 48+12*5] = [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe.\n          car2: [1+60,12+60]=[61,72] -> safe.\n        So safe.\n  Similarly, freeway4 and 5: same as freeway3? They have the same cars? Yes, so safe.\n\n  T43: U -> T44: y=4 -> freeway4 at T44: safe.\n  T44: U -> T45: y=5 -> freeway5 at T45: safe.\n  T45: U -> T46: y=6 -> freeway6: safe at all times.\n  T46: U -> T47: y=7 -> freeway7: safe.\n  T47: U -> T48: y=8 -> freeway8 at T48: \n        freeway8: \n          car1: (48,37,right,6) -> at T48: [37+6*(48-38),48+6*10] = [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe.\n          car2: (0,-11,right,6) -> at T48: [-11+6*10, 0+60] = [-11+60,60] = [49,60] -> safe.\n        So safe.\n  T48: U -> T49: y=9 -> done.\n\nTotal actions: \n  T38: S\n  T39: S\n  T40: U\n  T41: U\n  T42: U\n  T43: U\n  T44: U\n  T45: U\n  T46: U\n  T47: U\n  T48: U\n\nThat's 11 actions? But wait, we start at T38 and do 11 actions: \n  T38: action1 (S)\n  T39: action2 (S)\n  T40: action3 (U)\n  ...\n  T48: action11 (U) -> then at T49 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the sequence is from T38 to T48 (inclusive) -> 11 turns? \n\nBut H is the number of turns? And we are to output the actions for turns 38 to 38+H-1.\n\nWe reach at T49, which is the state after the last action at T48. So H=11.\n\nBut is there a faster way? \n\nWhat if we don't wait two turns at the beginning? \n\nWe must avoid being on freeway1-8 at T=40. So we have to be at y=0 at T=40. \n\nBut we start at T38 at y=0. We can do:\n\n  Option: \n    T38: D -> but we are at y=0, D would go to y=-1 -> not allowed, so we must stay at y=0? \n        Actually, the rule: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, and y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if at y=0 and D, then y_{t+1}=max(0,0-1)=0.\n        Similarly, S: stays 0.\n\n    So we can only do S at y=0.\n\n    Therefore, we must spend T38 and T39 at y=0? \n\n    So the minimal waiting at the beginning is 2 turns? \n\nThen 9 moves to go from y=0 to y=9: total 11 turns.\n\nBut note: we can also move down? But at y=0, down doesn't help. \n\nAlternatively, we can try to wait at a higher freeway? \n\nBut to get to a higher freeway we have to go through the unsafe ones at T=40? \n\nFor example, if we go up to y=1 at T38? \n  T38: U -> T39: y=1 (freeway1 at T39: safe) \n  Then at T39, we can choose to not go up? \n      We can do S: then at T40: we are at y=1 -> freeway1 at T40: unsafe -> not allowed.\n      Or D: then at T40: y=0 -> safe. \n          Then we are at y=0 at T40. Then we can start going up.\n\n          Actions:\n            T38: U -> y=1 at T39\n            T39: D -> y=0 at T40 (safe)\n            Then T40: U -> y=1 at T41 (freeway1 at T41: safe)\n            ... then same as before: 9 moves from T40 to get to y=9? \n            But note: from T40: at y=0, then we do U at T40: T41: y=1, ... T48: y=8, T49: U -> T50: y=9.\n\n          Total turns: 12? (T38 to T49: 12 actions) -> worse than 11.\n\n      Or at T39: we go up? then T40: y=2 -> unsafe.\n\nSo the initial two waits at the beginning seem necessary.\n\nBut wait: what if we go up to y=8 at T40? \n  How? \n    T38: U -> T39: y=1\n    T39: U -> T40: y=2 -> unsafe -> not allowed.\n\n  Alternatively, we cannot skip.\n\nAnother idea: use the fact that freeway8 is safe at T40. But to be at freeway8 (y=8) at T40, we need 8 moves in 2 turns? Impossible.\n\nTherefore, the minimal plan is to wait two turns at the beginning and then go straight up.\n\nBut let me check if we can avoid waiting two turns by taking a different path? \n\nWe must be at y=0 at T40. \n\nWe start at T38: y0=0. \n  At T38: we must do S (since if we do U, we go to y=1 at T39, and then at T39 we can do D to get to y=0 at T40? \n      That is: \n        T38: U -> T39: y=1\n        T39: D -> T40: y=0 -> safe.\n\n      Then we start at T40 at y=0. \n      Then we do 9 ups: \n        T40: U -> T41: y=1\n        T41: U -> T42: y=2\n        ... until T48: U -> T49: y=9.\n\n      Total actions: \n        T38: U\n        T39: D\n        T40: U\n        T41: U\n        ... T48: U -> that's 11 actions? \n          Actions: T38 to T48: that's 11 turns? \n          T38: first action, T39: second, T40: third, ... T48: 11th action.\n\n      Then at T49 we are at y=9 -> so H=11.\n\n  This is the same number of turns as the previous plan (11 actions). \n\n  But which one is better? They have the same H.\n\n  However, in this plan we do an extra up and down at the beginning. \n\n  But the problem only minimizes H (the number of turns) and not the path. \n\n  So both have H=11.\n\n  But note: we have to check the safety at each step.\n\n  Plan 1: \n      T38: S -> y=0 (safe)\n      T39: S -> y=0 (safe)\n      T40: U -> y=1 at T41 -> freeway1 at T41: safe? \n            freeway1: at T41: [48-36*(41-38), 83-36*3] = [48-108, 83-108] = [-60,-25] -> safe.\n      ... \n\n  Plan 2:\n      T38: U -> at T39: y=1 -> freeway1 at T39: \n            [48-36*(39-38), 83-36] = [12,47] -> safe.\n      T39: D -> at T40: y=0 -> safe (not on freeway)\n      T40: U -> at T41: y=1 -> freeway1: [48-36*3,83-108]=[-60,-25] -> safe.\n\n  So both are safe.\n\n  But note: when we are at freeway8? \n      In plan1: \n          T47: U -> at T48: y=8 -> freeway8 at T48: \n                car1: [37+6*(48-38),48+60]=[97,108] -> safe.\n                car2: [-11+60,0+60]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\n      In plan2: \n          We will be at y=8 at T48? \n          Starting from T40: y=0, then:\n            T40: U -> T41: y=1\n            T41: U -> T42: y=2\n            T42: U -> T43: y=3\n            T43: U -> T44: y=4\n            T44: U -> T45: y=5\n            T45: U -> T46: y=6\n            T46: U -> T47: y=7\n            T47: U -> T48: y=8 -> same as above: safe.\n\n  So both are safe and both take 11 turns.\n\n  But the problem asks for minimal H. Both are 11.\n\n  However, we must output one sequence.\n\n  The problem does not specify if we have to minimize the number of moves or the path, but only the number of turns H.\n\n  Since H is the same, we can choose either.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", so 11 is minimal.\n\n  Is there a way to do it in 10? \n\n  We must be at y=9 at the end of the 10th action? \n      Action at T38: then at T39 we are at y1, ... at T47 (after 10 actions) we are at y10, and then we require y10=9.\n\n      How? \n        Start at T38: y0=0.\n        After 10 actions (T38 to T47) we are at y10.\n\n        The net displacement: each U: +1, D: -1, S:0. \n        We need to go from 0 to 9: so net +9.\n\n        Let u = number of U, d = number of D, s = number of S, and u+d+s=10, and u-d=9.\n\n        Then: u = d+9, then (d+9) + d + s = 10 -> 2d + s = 1 -> so d=0, s=1? then 2*0+1=1 -> then u=9.\n\n        So we must have 9 U and 1 S.\n\n        The sequence: 9 U and 1 S, in some order.\n\n        But we must avoid collisions.\n\n        We must avoid being at any freeway 1..8 at T=40? \n\n        At T40, we are at the state after 3 actions (T38, T39, T40). \n          Let the actions: \n            T38, T39, T40: we have done 3 actions.\n\n          The y position at T40: \n             We start at 0, then 3 actions: let u3, d3, s3 with u3+d3+s3=3, u3-d3 = y40.\n\n          We must have y40=0? because if we are at y>0 at T40, then we are on a freeway and we must avoid T=40 for freeways 1-5 and 8? \n          But freeway8 is safe at T40? \n          However, freeway1-5 are unsafe at T40. So if we are at freeway1-5 at T40, unsafe. \n          Freeway6,7,8: \n            freeway6,7: safe at T40? yes.\n            freeway8: safe at T40? yes (since unsafe only at T38,39).\n\n          So we can be at y=6,7,8 at T40.\n\n        But can we be at y=6,7,8 at T40? \n          We start at y=0. \n          After 3 actions: we need to get to y=6,7,8? \n          The net displacement: u3 - d3 = y40, and we need y40 in {6,7,8}. \n          Also, we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\n          Maximum we can go: 3 U -> y=3. \n          So we cannot get to y=6 in 3 moves.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot be at a safe freeway (6,7,8) at T40? \n\n        The only safe position at T40 is y=0? \n\n        But then we must have y40=0. Then u3-d3=0, and u3+d3+s3=3 -> then u3=d3, so u3+d3 is even, so s3=3-2*u3 must be nonnegative.\n\n          Possibilities: \n            u3=0, d3=0, s3=3 -> then y40=0.\n            u3=1, d3=1, s3=1 -> y40=0.\n\n          So we can have two possibilities: either three S, or one U, one D, one S (in any order).\n\n        Then we have 10 actions: 9 U and 1 S. \n          The net displacement: 9.\n\n        How to arrange the actions? \n\n        We have to do 9 U and 1 S, and the sequence must avoid collisions.\n\n        We must be at y=0 at T40? \n\n        Consider the first three actions (T38, T39, T40) must yield y40=0.\n\n        Possibility 1: \n          T38: S\n          T39: S\n          T40: S -> then y40=0.\n\n        Then we have 7 more actions: 9 U and 1 S, but we have already used 3 S? \n          Total S: we have used 3, but we only have 1 S in the entire sequence? -> no.\n\n        Possibility 2: one U, one D, one S in the first three actions? \n          Then we have 9 U and 1 S in total, so in the remaining 7 actions we must do 8 U? -> that's 8 U and 0 D and 0 S? \n          But then we have 9 U in total (one already in the first three) and one D and one S? \n          But then net displacement: (9) - (1) = 8, but we need 9? -> no.\n\n        Alternatively, if we do one U, one D, and one S in the first three, then the net for the first three is 0. \n          Then the remaining 7 actions must be 9 - 1 = 8 U? But we only have 7 actions -> we need 8 U? impossible.\n\n        So we cannot do it in 10 turns.\n\n        Therefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nSo we can choose either sequence: \n\n  Sequence 1: \n    T38: S\n    T39: S\n    T40: U\n    T41: U\n    T42: U\n    T43: U\n    T44: U\n    T45: U\n    T46: U\n    T47: U\n    T48: U\n\n  Sequence 2:\n    T38: U\n    T39: D\n    T40: U\n    T41: U\n    T42: U\n    T43: U\n    T44: U\n    T45: U\n    T46: U\n    T47: U\n    T48: U\n\nBut note: in sequence2, we do an extra move (U then D) at the beginning. \n\nWe must check at T39: we are at y=1 (freeway1) and then T40: we are at y=0 (so we leave freeway1 at T40). \n\nBut at T39: we are at freeway1: and we computed that freeway1 at T39 is safe? \n  T39: freeway1: [48-36,83-36] = [12,47] -> safe.\n\nAnd then T40: we are at y=0 (safe). \n\nBut note: when we move down from y=1 at T39 to y=0 at T40, at turn T39 we are at freeway1? and we check freeway1 at T39: safe.\n\nSo both sequences are safe.\n\nWe can choose either. \n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns\", and both have 11.\n\nWe'll choose the first one to avoid the unnecessary up and down.\n\nAlternatively, we might choose the second one if it allows a shorter path? but it doesn't.\n\nBut wait, is there a way to do 11 turns without waiting two S at the beginning? \n\nWe have to be at y=0 at T40. \n\nWe start at T38: y=0. \n  We can do:\n    T38: S -> T39: y=0\n    T39: S -> T40: y=0\n\n  or \n    T38: U -> T39: y=1\n    T39: D -> T40: y=0\n\n  or even:\n    T38: D -> T39: y=0 (since D at y=0 stays at 0)\n    T39: S -> T40: y=0\n\n  So that's also two turns and we end at y=0 at T40.\n\n  Then we do 9 U's.\n\n  So sequence 3:\n    T38: D\n    T39: S\n    T40: U\n    T41: U\n    ... T48: U\n\n  This is also 11 actions.\n\n  But we can choose any.\n\nI'll choose sequence 1: two S at the beginning and then 9 U's.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal H\", and we have 11, and we cannot do 10.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\nTurn 38: S\nTurn 39: S\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\n\nBut wait, we are at y=9 at turn 49? \n  After the last action at turn48: we do U and then at turn49 we are at y=9.\n\n  The sequence of actions is for turns 38 to 48 (inclusive) -> 11 actions.\n\n  So H=11.\n\nBut let me double-check the freeways we step on:\n\n  Turn38: at y=0 -> safe (not freeway)\n  Turn39: at y=0 -> safe\n  Turn40: action U -> then at turn41: y=1 -> so at turn40 we are still at y=0? \n        Actually, the rule: \n          At turn t, we are at y_t, and we choose action a_t. \n          Then y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta.\n\n        So at turn40: we are at y40 = ? \n          Start: turn38: y38=0.\n          After T38: S -> y39=0.\n          After T39: S -> y40=0.\n          Then at turn40: we choose U -> then y41 = 0+1 = 1.\n\n        Therefore, at turn40: we are at y=0 -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn41: we are at y=1 -> freeway1 at turn41: \n              [48-36*(41-38), 83-36*3] = [48-108, 83-108] = [-60,-25] -> safe.\n\n        Then turn41: U -> y42=2 -> freeway2 at turn42: \n              same as freeway1: [48-36*(42-38),83-36*4] = [48-144,83-144] = [-96,-61] -> safe.\n\n        Then turn42: U -> y43=3 -> freeway3 at turn43: \n              car3: [-35+12*(43-38), -24+12*5] = [-35+60, -24+60] = [25,36] -> safe.\n              car1 and car2 are out of range -> safe.\n\n        Similarly, freeway4,5: same as freeway3 -> safe.\n\n        Turn43: U -> y44=4 -> freeway4: same as above -> safe.\n        Turn44: U -> y45=5 -> freeway5: safe.\n        Turn45: U -> y46=6 -> freeway6: safe (always safe).\n        Turn46: U -> y47=7 -> freeway7: safe.\n        Turn47: U -> y48=8 -> freeway8 at turn48: \n              car1: [37+6*(48-38),48+60] = [97,108] -> safe.\n              car2: [-11+60,60] = [49,60] -> safe.\n        Turn48: U -> then at turn49: y49=9 -> done.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 38: S\nTurn 39: S\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\n}\n\nBut note: the last action at turn48: U, and then at turn49 we are at y=9. \n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" to reach (0,9). \n\nWe started at t1=38, and we did actions for t=0 to 10? (11 actions) so that after the last action we are at y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo H=11.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 38, while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 11. The sequence of actions is designed to avoid being on any unsafe freeway at turn 40, where freeways 1 to 5 are unsafe due to car spans covering \\(x = 0\\).

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 40. I need to get to (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player moves vertically: U for up (+1 in y), D for down (-1 in y), or S for stay (no change). y must stay between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8), and at that same turn, for the car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span. The span is the positions occupied by the car.\n\nCars move horizontally. Left-moving cars have head and tail defined such that as time increases, the span shifts left (decreasing x). Right-moving cars shift right (increasing x).\n\nThe key point is that collision is checked only at the turn when the player is on the freeway. If the player moves to a new freeway at turn T, they are not on that freeway until the next position, so for the move at turn T, they are on y_T when the action is taken, and then move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nLet me read the collision rule carefully:\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThis means that at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, so collision is checked for cars on freeway y_T at that turn. When the player takes an action that changes y, say from y_T to y_{T+1}, at turn T, they are still on y_T for collision purposes. Only after the move, at turn T+1, they are on y_{T+1}.\n\nSo, for example, if at turn T, player is on y=2, and moves to y=3, at turn T, collision is checked for y=2 cars. At turn T+1, they are on y=3, so collision checked for y=3 cars.\n\nNow, the car spans are given at turn t_1=40. For future turns, the spans change based on speed and direction.\n\nFor a car, at turn T > t_1, the span is:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s*(T - t_1), τ - s*(T - t_1)] but I need to know how head and tail are defined.\n\nIn the car state, for left-moving cars, it says (head h, tail τ, direction left, speed s), and Span(t_1) = [h, τ] for left-moving? Let's see the update.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\n\nBut [h, τ] with h and τ, which one is left or right? It says for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and since it moves left, h and τ both decrease, so I think h is the right end, τ is the left end? No.\n\nIf it moves left, the positions decrease. Suppose at t_1, the car occupies from x_left to x_right, with x_left < x_right.\n\nFor left-moving, as time increases, both x_left and x_right decrease.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and then Span(T) = [h - s dT, τ - s dT], where dT = T - t_1.\n\nBut [h, τ] – is this [min, max] or [max, min]? Typically, a span is written with min and max, but here it might not be sorted.\n\nFor example, in freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36). Span(t_1) = [48, 83]? But 48 to 83, if it's moving left, that means at t_1, it's from 48 to 83, so min=48, max=83? But as it moves left, min and max both decrease.\n\nBut in the update, it says [h - s dT, τ - s dT], so if h=48, τ=83, then at T, [48 - s dT, 83 - s dT], which since s dT >0, 48 - s dT < 48, 83 - s dT < 83, so the left end decreases, right end decreases, so the car moves left.\n\nBut 48 to 83, with 48 left or right? If it's moving left, and positions decrease, then at t_1, x=48 is the left end? No.\n\nLet's think: if the car is moving left, its position values decrease. So at t_1, it has a certain span. Say left end L, right end R, with L < R. Then at T, left end is L - s dT, right end R - s dT.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ]. In this case, for freeway 1, (48,83, left,36), so h=48, τ=83. But 48 < 83, so [48,83] likely means from 48 to 83, so min=48, max=83. So left end is 48, right end is 83.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h] for some? Let's see.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nFor freeway 3, for example, (48,37, right,12) – but it says (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s), so for right-moving, h and τ are defined, but in the span, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h].\n\nFor freeway 3, first car: (48,37, right,12). So h=48, τ=37? And direction right, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [37,48]? Then it moves right, so at T, [37 + s dT, 48 + s dT].\n\nSince it's moving right, positions increase, so at t_1, min=37, max=48, then at T, min=37 + s dT, max=48 + s dT.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 1: (48,83, left,36), h=48, τ=83, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [48,83], min=48, max=83, at T, min=48 - s dT, max=83 - s dT.\n\nIn the car list, for some freeways, there are multiple cars. For example, freeway 3 has three cars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12).\n\nEach car has its own span and moves independently.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, player is on freeway k (y_T = k), and for any car on that freeway, 0 is within its span at that turn, meaning min ≤ 0 ≤ max for that car's span at turn T.\n\n0 is the x-position where the player is, since player is always at x=0.\n\nPlayer is at (0, y_t), so x=0 always.\n\nSo collision if on freeway y_t at turn t, and there is a car on that row with span containing 0 at time t.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at t=40 to y=9 in min turns.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0 or y=9, no cars, so no collision possible. So we start and end on safe rows.\n\nThe player can move up, down, or stay, but since we want min turns to reach y=9, and we start at y=0, we should mostly move up, but we have to avoid the cars on y=1 to 8 at the times we are on those rows.\n\nSince we can also move down or stay, but to minimize turns, we should avoid unnecessary moves, so probably go up as fast as possible, but might need to wait or adjust to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, I need to model the car positions over time.\n\nLet t be the turn number, with t=40 as now.\n\nFor each freeway k=1 to 8, and for each car on it, I need to know when the car's span contains 0.\n\nThat is, for a car on freeway k, at time t, 0 is in its span if min(t) <= 0 <= max(t) for that car.\n\nSince the player is on y=k at time t only if we choose to be there, we need to ensure that when we are on k at time t, no car on k has 0 in span at t.\n\nNow, for each car, the span changes linearly with time.\n\nLet dT = t - 40, so for time t, dT = t - 40.\n\nFor a left-moving car: at time t, span min = h - s * dT, max = τ - s * dT\n\nFrom above: for left-moving, Span(t) = [h - s (t - 40), τ - s (t - 40)]\n\nSince h and τ, with min and max, but in notation, for left-moving, [h, τ] at t=40, so min = min(h,τ), max = max(h,τ)? Not necessarily, in the example, for freeway 1, h=48, τ=83, both positive, min=48, max=83.\n\nBut for other cars, it might be different.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nIn general, for a car, we can compute the span min and max at time t.\n\nThen 0 in span if min(t) <= 0 <= max(t).\n\nBut min(t) and max(t) depend on the car.\n\nAlso, since multiple cars per freeway, we need to check all cars on that freeway at that time.\n\nNow, let's list all freeways and their cars at t=40.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: left-moving, h=48, τ=83, s=36\n\nSo at time t, min(t) = 48 - 36*(t-40)\n\nmax(t) = 83 - 36*(t-40)\n\n0 in span if min(t) <= 0 <= max(t), i.e., 48 - 36*(t-40) <= 0 and 0 <= 83 - 36*(t-40)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? Cars: (48,83,left,36) , one car, same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars:\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) — direction right, so for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [37,48]? Earlier I thought.\n\nFrom the rule: for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s dT, h + s dT]\n\nSo for this car, h=48, τ=37, s=12, direction right.\n\nAt t=40, Span = [τ, h] = [37,48], so min=37, max=48.\n\nAt time t, min(t) = 37 + 12*(t-40)\n\nmax(t) = 48 + 12*(t-40)\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 3: (12,1,right,12), h=12, τ=1, so at t=40, Span=[τ,h]=[1,12], min=1, max=12\n\nAt t, min(t)=1 + 12*(t-40)\n\nmax(t)=12 + 12*(t-40)\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12), h=-24, τ=-35? Span(t_1)=[τ,h]=[-35,-24], min=-35, max=-24\n\nAt t, min(t)= -35 + 12*(t-40)\n\nmax(t)= -24 + 12*(t-40)\n\nNow, freeway 4: same as freeway 3? Cars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) — identical to freeway 3.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same, all three cars.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (48,37,right,6) — direction right, h=48, τ=37, s=6\n\nAt t=40, Span=[τ,h]=[37,48], min=37, max=48\n\nAt t, min(t)=37 + 6*(t-40)\n\nmax(t)=48 + 6*(t-40)\n\nFreeway 7: same as 6? (48,37,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (48,37,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6), same as above.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6), h=0, τ=-11, direction right.\n\nAt t=40, Span=[τ,h]=[-11,0], min=-11, max=0\n\nAt t, min(t)= -11 + 6*(t-40)\n\nmax(t)= 0 + 6*(t-40) = 6*(t-40)\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find times when it is unsafe, i.e., when there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, I need to avoid being on a freeway when it is unsafe at that time.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9.\n\nStart at y=0, t=40.\n\nI need to choose a sequence of actions to change y to 9.\n\nSince min turns, and we need to go up 9 units, from y=0 to y=9, the min possible H is 9, if we go up every turn, but we might hit a car, so we need to see if that's possible or if we need to wait or go down sometimes.\n\nBut going down might increase H, so it's better to avoid if possible.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when it is unsafe.\n\nDefine dT = t - 40, so t = 40 + dT, dT >=0.\n\nFor freeway 1: one left-moving car, s=36, min(t) = 48 - 36 dT, max(t) = 83 - 36 dT\n\n0 in span if min(t) <= 0 <= max(t)\n\nSo 48 - 36 dT <= 0 and 0 <= 83 - 36 dT\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36 dT <= 0 => 36 dT >= 48 => dT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 83 - 36 dT => 36 dT <= 83 => dT <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSo for dT from ceil(4/3) to floor(2.305), but dT integer since turns.\n\ndT must be integer, t integer.\n\ndT >= ceil(1.333) = 2? Let's see.\n\nmin(t) <=0 when 48 -36 dT <=0 => dT >= 48/36 = 4/3 = 1.333, so since dT integer, dT >= 2\n\nmax(t) >=0 when 83 -36 dT >=0, which is dT <= 83/36 ≈2.305, so dT <=2\n\ndT <= floor(2.305) =2\n\nSo dT >=2 and dT <=2, so only at dT=2, i.e., t=42\n\nAt dT=2, min(t) =48 -36*2=48-72= -24\n\nmax(t)=83-72=11\n\n0 between -24 and 11, yes.\n\nAt dT=1, min(t)=48-36=12>0, so min>0, 0 not <= min, so 0 not in span.\n\nAt dT=3, min(t)=48-108= -60, max(t)=83-108= -25<0, so max<0, 0 not >= max, so not in span.\n\nSo freeway 1 unsafe only at t=42.\n\nt=40 + dT, dT=2, t=42.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same car, same as freeway 1, so unsafe only at t=42.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: right-moving, min(t)=37 +12 dT, max(t)=48 +12 dT\n\n0 in span if 37 +12 dT <= 0 <= 48 +12 dT\n\nBut 37 +12 dT <=0 => 12 dT <= -37, impossible since dT>=0, so min(t) >=37 >0, so 0 never in span for this car.\n\nSimilarly, second car: min(t)=1 +12 dT >=1>0, so always min>0, 0 never <= min, so never in span.\n\nThird car: min(t)= -35 +12 dT, max(t)= -24 +12 dT\n\n0 in span if min(t) <=0 <= max(t)\n\nmin(t) <=0: -35 +12 dT <=0 => 12 dT <=35 => dT <= 35/12 ≈2.916, so dT <=2\n\nmax(t) >=0: -24 +12 dT >=0 => 12 dT >=24 => dT >=2\n\nSo dT >=2 and dT <=2, so only at dT=2, t=42\n\nAt dT=2, min(t)= -35 +24= -11, max(t)= -24+24=0, so 0 between -11 and 0, inclusive? max(t)=0, so 0 <=0 is true, so yes, 0 in span.\n\nAt dT=1, min(t)= -35+12= -23, max(t)= -24+12= -12 <0, so max<0, 0 not in span.\n\nAt dT=3, min(t)= -35+36=1>0, min>0, 0 not <= min? min=1>0, so 0 < min, not in span.\n\nSo for freeway 3, only the third car has 0 in span at t=42.\n\nThus freeway 3 unsafe at t=42.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same as freeway 3, so unsafe at t=42.\n\nFreeway 5: same, unsafe at t=42.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car, right-moving, min(t)=37 +6 dT, max(t)=48 +6 dT\n\nBoth min and max increase, min(t) >=37>0, so 0 never <= min, thus never in span. So freeway 6 always safe? min(t)=37+6dT >=37>0, so span is always above 0, so 0 not in span, yes. So freeway 6 safe at all times.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: same car, so always safe.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6), min(t)=37+6dT >=37>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6), min(t)= -11 +6 dT, max(t)= 0 +6 dT =6 dT\n\n0 in span if min(t) <=0 <= max(t)\n\nmin(t) <=0: -11 +6 dT <=0 => 6 dT <=11 => dT <= 11/6 ≈1.833, so dT <=1\n\nmax(t) >=0: 6 dT >=0, always true for dT>=0.\n\nSo 0 in span when min(t) <=0 and max(t) >=0.\n\nmin(t) <=0: dT <= floor(1.833)=1\n\nmax(t) >=0 always for dT>=0.\n\nSo for dT=0, min(t)= -11, max(t)=0, so 0 <=0 true.\n\ndT=1, min(t)= -11+6= -5, max(t)=6, so min<=0<=max.\n\ndT=2, min(t)= -11+12=1, max(t)=12, min=1>0, so 0 < min, not in span.\n\nThus for second car, 0 in span at dT=0 and dT=1, i.e., t=40 and t=41.\n\nt=40 + dT.\n\nAt t=40, dT=0: min= -11, max=0, 0 in span.\n\nAt t=41, dT=1: min= -5, max=6, 0 in span.\n\nAt t=42, dT=2: min=1, max=12, 0 not in span.\n\nSo freeway 8 unsafe at t=40 and t=41 because of the second car.\n\nFirst car is always safe, but second car causes unsafe at t=40 and t=41.\n\nNow, summarize unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: unsafe at t=42\n\n- Freeway 2: unsafe at t=42\n\n- Freeway 3: unsafe at t=42\n\n- Freeway 4: unsafe at t=42\n\n- Freeway 5: unsafe at t=42\n\n- Freeway 6: always safe\n\n- Freeway 7: always safe\n\n- Freeway 8: unsafe at t=40 and t=41\n\nAt t=40, player is at y=0, which is safe, since not on freeway.\n\nPlayer starts at t=40, position (0,0), which is not on freeway, so no collision.\n\nWe need to be on freeways only when moving between 0 and 9.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=0 in min turns.\n\nMin H=9, meaning we reach at t=40+8? Let's see.\n\nStart at t=40, y=0.\n\nAfter one action at t=40, we move to y at t=41.\n\nGenerally, at turn t, we take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y.\n\ny_t is position at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, we are at position y_t, take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y, with bounds.\n\nCollision at turn t depends on y_t.\n\nFor example, at t=40, y_t=0, not on freeway, safe.\n\nThen we take action a_40, which sets y_{41} = y_40 + delta y.\n\nAt t=41, we are at y_41, and so on.\n\nWe want y_H = 9 for some H, but the sequence ends when we reach (0,9), so after H-1 actions, we are at y_{t_1 + H-1} =9.\n\nStart: t=40, y=0.\n\nAfter H turns, meaning after H actions? The sequence is from t=0 to H-1 relative, so actions at t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and after H actions, we are at position after turn t_1 + H-1.\n\nAt turn t, before action, we are at y_t.\n\nTake action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + a_t effect.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nThe position y_t is for turn t.\n\nTo have y_T =9 for some T.\n\nStart at t=40, y_40=0.\n\nWe want y_{40 + K} =9 for some K, with K min.\n\nK is the number of turns from start, so after K steps, we are at y_{40+K}.\n\nThe minimal K is 9, if we go up every turn.\n\nBut we might not be able to due to cars.\n\nNow, the actions: at each turn t from 40 to 40+K-1, we take action, setting y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision at turn t, it depends on y_t and the cars at t.\n\ny_t must be such that if y_t between 1 and 8, it must be safe at time t.\n\nNow, for min K, let's see if K=9 is possible: that is, reach y=9 at t=49? Let's compute.\n\nIf we go up every turn from t=40 to t=48, then:\n\nAt t=40: y=0, safe\n\nAction U, y_{41} =1\n\nAt t=41: y=1, now on freeway 1. Is it safe at t=41?\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe only at t=42, so at t=41, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=41, y=1, freeway 1.\n\nFrom above, freeway 1 unsafe only at t=42, so at t=41, safe.\n\nThen action U, y_{42}=2\n\nAt t=42: y=2, on freeway 2. Freeway 2 unsafe at t=42? Yes, from above.\n\nFreeway 2 unsafe at t=42, so if we are on y=2 at t=42, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf we go directly up, at t=42, we are on y=2, which is unsafe.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on freeways 1,2,3,4,5 at t=42, since all unsafe at t=42.\n\nFreeways 1,2,3,4,5 all unsafe at t=42.\n\nFreeway 6 and 7 always safe, freeway 8 unsafe at t=40 and 41.\n\nNow, to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nPossible paths: we can go up directly, but need to skip or avoid the unsafe times.\n\nSince min turns, we should go up as much as possible, but at t=42, we should not be on y=1,2,3,4,5.\n\ny=1 to 5 are unsafe at t=42.\n\ny=6,7,8 might be safe or not.\n\nAt t=42, freeway 6 and 7 are always safe, freeway 8: at t=42, from above, unsafe only at t=40,41, so at t=42, safe.\n\nSo at t=42, y=6,7,8 are safe.\n\ny=1,2,3,4,5 unsafe at t=42.\n\nNow, we start at t=40, y=0.\n\nAt t=40, we take action, which sets y_{41}.\n\nOptions: U, D, S.\n\nBut D to y=-1 not allowed, y must be >=0, so D not possible from y=0, since y_{t+1} = y_t -1, but y_t=0, y_{t+1} >=0, so if a_t=D, y_{t+1}=max(0, y_t -1)=0, so stay at 0. Similarly for U to 10, but y<=9, so U from 9 to 9 or something.\n\nBut at y=0, possible actions: U: to y=1, S: stay y=0, D: to y=0 (since cannot go below).\n\nSimilarly at y=9, U: to y=9, D: to y=8, S: stay.\n\nBut we are at y=0, so to min time, probably go U.\n\nBut if we go U at t=40, y_{41}=1.\n\nAt t=41, on freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe only at t=42, so at t=41, safe? Yes.\n\nBut at t=41, we are on y=1.\n\nThen we need to take action at t=41.\n\nIf we go U, to y=2 at t=42.\n\nBut at t=42, y=2 is unsafe.\n\nIf we stay S, then y_{42}=1, still on freeway 1 at t=42, which is unsafe.\n\nIf go down D, y_{42}=0, to safe row.\n\nBut then we lose progress.\n\nSimilarly, we could at t=40 stay or something.\n\nSince at t=42, y=1 to 5 are unsafe, we need to not be on those rows at t=42.\n\nPossible to be on y=0, or y=6,7,8,9 at t=42.\n\ny=9 is goal, but we may not reach yet.\n\nNow, at t=40, we are at y=0.\n\nWe take action to set y_{41}.\n\ny_{41} can be 0 or 1.\n\nIf we set y_{41}=0, by staying or down, but down same as stay at 0.\n\nThen at t=41, we are at y=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=41, take action.\n\nBut this might delay.\n\nTo reach y=9 faster, better to go up.\n\nBut we have the t=42 problem.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=6 or 7 before t=42, since y=6 and 7 always safe.\n\nBut from y=0 to y=6, min 6 steps.\n\nStart t=40, y=0.\n\nAfter 6 actions, if all U, y_{46}=6? Let's see:\n\nt=40: y=0\n\na40: U, y41=1\n\na41: U, y42=2\n\nBut at t=42, y=2 unsafe, so cannot.\n\nIf we go faster, but we can only move one step per turn.\n\nUnless we start from t=40.\n\nAt t=40, y=0\n\nIf we could be at higher y earlier, but no, we start at 0.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=8 or something to avoid.\n\nLet's list the times.\n\nt=40: start y=0, safe\n\nt=41: y= something, must be safe\n\nt=42: y must not be 1,2,3,4,5; so y=0,6,7,8,9\n\nThen t=43 onward, we can go up.\n\nBut at t=42, if we are at y=0,6,7,8,9.\n\ny=9 is goal, but if we reach at t=42, that would be fast, but from y=0 to y=9 in 2 steps? Impossible, min 9 steps.\n\ny_{t} at t=42.\n\nt=42 is after some actions.\n\nFrom t=40 to t=42, we have two actions: at t=40 and t=41, setting y41 and y42.\n\ny42 is position at turn 42.\n\nTo have y42 not in {1,2,3,4,5}, so y42=0 or 6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y42=9 means we reached goal at t=42, but from y40=0 to y42=9, that requires +9 in two steps, impossible since max +1 per step. Max y42=2 if we go up twice: y40=0, a40=U, y41=1, a41=U, y42=2.\n\nOr if we stay or down, lower.\n\nSo y42 <=2, since from 0, after two up, y=2.\n\nSimilarly, min y42=0 if stay or down.\n\nSo possible y42: 0,1,2.\n\nBut 1 and 2 are unsafe at t=42, so only y42=0 is possible and safe at t=42? y=0 is safe, but we are not on freeway.\n\ny42=0 means we are at (0,0), which is safe, but we need to go to 9.\n\nIf y42=0, we have made no progress, then we need to start going up later, which will take more turns.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=0 until after t=42.\n\nAt t=40, take S or D, y41=0\n\nAt t=41, take S or D, y42=0\n\nThen at t=42, y=0, safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up to y=9.\n\nBut it will take at least 9 more turns from t=42, so reach y=9 at t=51, H=11 turns? Let's see the sequence.\n\nStart t=40, y=0\n\nAction: say S at t=40, y41=0\n\nAction at t=41: S, y42=0\n\nNow at t=42, y=0\n\nThen actions to go up: a42=U, y43=1\n\na43=U, y44=2\n\n...\n\nBut need to check if safe.\n\nAt t=43: y=1, freeway 1. Now t=43, is freeway 1 safe?\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe only at t=42, so at t=43, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 at t=44: y=2, freeway 2 unsafe only at t=42, so safe at t=44.\n\nSimilarly, all freeways except possibly 8, but freeway 8 unsafe only at t=40,41, so after that safe.\n\nFreeway 6 and 7 always safe.\n\nSo from t=42, y=0, we can go up each turn: U at t=42, y43=1; U at t=43, y44=2; ... U at t=48, y49=6? Let's compute:\n\nt=42, y=0\n\na42=U, y43=1\n\na43=U, y44=2\n\na44=U, y45=3\n\na45=U, y46=4\n\na46=U, y47=5\n\na47=U, y48=6\n\na48=U, y49=7\n\na49=U, y50=8\n\na50=U, y51=9\n\nSo at t=51, y=9.\n\nH: number of actions from t=40 to t=50? Actions at t=40 to t=50, 11 actions, reach y51=9.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nInstead of staying at 0, we can go to y=6 or 7 at t=42, since they are safe.\n\ny=6 or 7 at t=42.\n\nHow to reach y=6 at t=42 from y=0 at t=40.\n\nIn two steps, max y=2, so impossible to reach y=6 at t=42.\n\nMin steps to y=6 is 6 steps, so at t=46.\n\nFor example: start t=40, y=0\n\na40=U, y41=1\n\na41=U, y42=2 but unsafe, cannot.\n\nSo we need to be at y=0 at t=42, as above.\n\nBut perhaps we can be at y=8 or 9 at t=42, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: go down or stay at t=40, but y can only be 0.\n\nPerhaps we can go to a safe row at t=41.\n\nAt t=41, we can be on y=1 or y=0.\n\ny=0 is safe, y=1: freeway 1 at t=41 is safe, as we saw.\n\nIf we go to y=1 at t=41, safe.\n\nThen at t=41, we need to take action such that at t=42, we are not on y=1,2,3,4,5.\n\nSo from y=1, actions: U to y=2, but unsafe at t=42.\n\nD to y=0, safe at t=42.\n\nS to y=1, unsafe at t=42.\n\nSo only down to y=0.\n\nSo if at t=41, y=1, we must go down to y=0 at t=42.\n\nThen we are back to y=0 at t=42.\n\nThen same as before, need to go up from there.\n\nSo sequence: t=40: U, to y41=1\n\nt=41: D, to y42=0\n\nThen from t=42: U, y43=1; U, y44=2; ... to y51=9, same as before, 11 turns.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at t=51, after 11 actions from t=40 to t=50.\n\nActions from t=40 to t=50 inclusive? 11 actions.\n\nBut min possible is 9, but we couldn't due to t=42.\n\nPerhaps we can go to higher freeways faster after t=42.\n\nBut from y=0 at t=42, min to y=9 is 9 steps.\n\nUnless we can be at higher y at t=42.\n\nBut from start, in two steps, max y=2.\n\nAnother thought: freeway 8 is unsafe at t=40 and t=41, but safe after.\n\nBut we start at y=0, not on freeway.\n\nAt t=41, if we are on y=8, it would be unsafe, but we are at y=0 or 1.\n\nNot relevant.\n\nPerhaps we can use the safe freeways 6 and 7.\n\nFor example, if we can reach y=6 or 7 quickly and stay there, but from y=0, it takes min 6 steps to y=6.\n\nBut at t=42, we need to avoid y=1-5.\n\nSo let's list the positions over time.\n\nDenote y_t for t=40,41,42,...\n\nWe need y_t safe for each t.\n\ny_t=0 or 9 always safe.\n\nFor t=42, y42 must be 0,6,7,8 (since 9 not reachable yet)\n\nBut y42 can only be 0,1,2 as we start from 0.\n\nSo only y42=0 is possible and safe.\n\nThen from there, we go up.\n\nBut at t=43, y=1, which is safe since freeway 1 unsafe only at t=42.\n\nSimilarly, t=44, y=2, freeway 2 safe at t=44, etc.\n\nBut when we reach y=5, freeway 5, which is safe except t=42, so at t=47 for example, safe.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have y47=5 at t=47, which is after t=42, so safe.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nBut it takes 11 turns to reach y=9 at t=51.\n\nPerhaps we can start going up later or something, but not better.\n\nAnother idea: at t=40, we go up to y=1.\n\nAt t=41, instead of going down, we could go up to a row that is safe at t=42, but y=3,4,5 not safe, only 6,7,8, but we can't reach from y=1 in one step; max to y=2.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps we stay at y=0 at t=40 and t=41, so y41=0, y42=0.\n\nThen at t=42, y=0.\n\nThen we can go up, but same as before.\n\nBut at t=41, we are at y=0, which is fine.\n\nBut we can go up at t=41 to y=1, but at t=42 we have to go down or stay, both not good.\n\nUnless we can be on y=6 at t=42, impossible.\n\nPerhaps after t=42, we can go faster, but no.\n\nAnother thought: freeway 8 has a car that is unsafe at t=40 and t=41, but since we are not on it, no problem.\n\nBut for going up, we need to cross freeway 8 at some point.\n\nBut freeway 8 is only unsafe at t=40 and t=41, so after that safe.\n\nIn the sequence, when we go from y=7 to y=8 or something, but at that time, t>42, freeway 8 safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut in the min 9-step path, we would be on y=8 at t=48, for example, which is fine.\n\nBut we can't take the min 9-step because of t=42.\n\nPerhaps we can delay the ascent or start later.\n\nBut we start at t=40.\n\nLet's list all unsafe times for each row.\n\nFor each freeway k, times t when it is unsafe.\n\nFrom above:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe only at t=42\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe only at t=42\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe only at t=42\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe only at t=42\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe only at t=42\n\nFreeway 6: always safe\n\nFreeway 7: always safe\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at t=40 and t=41\n\nAt t=40, player is at y=0, not on freeway, so for freeway 8 unsafe at t=40, but player not on it, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly at t=41, if player on y=8, it would be unsafe, but player at y=0 or 1, not on y=8.\n\nSo only constraint is that at t=42, we cannot be on y=1,2,3,4,5.\n\nSince we start from y=0 at t=40, after two steps, we can only be at y=0,1,2 at t=42.\n\ny=1 and 2 are unsafe at t=42, so we must be at y=0 at t=42.\n\nThen from t=42, y=0, we go up to y=9 in 9 steps, reaching at t=51.\n\nBut is there a way to be at higher y at t=42? No.\n\nPerhaps we can go up to y=1 at t=41, then at t=41, instead of going down, we stay or something, but at t=42, if we stay on y=1, unsafe.\n\nOr go up to y=2, unsafe.\n\nSo only down to y=0.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nThus the minimal H is 11, with sequence:\n\nt=40: action U, to y41=1\n\nt=41: action D, to y42=0  (but D from y=1 to y=0)\n\nThen t=42: action U, to y43=1\n\nt=43: U, to y44=2\n\nt=44: U, to y45=3\n\nt=45: U, to y46=4\n\nt=46: U, to y47=5\n\nt=47: U, to y48=6\n\nt=48: U, to y49=7\n\nt=49: U, to y50=8\n\nt=50: U, to y51=9\n\nNow, at t=51, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=40 to t=50, 11 actions.\n\nH=11 turns.\n\nBut at t=41, we are at y=1, which is freeway 1, and at t=41, it is safe, as we checked.\n\nAt t=42, y=0, safe.\n\nThen from t=43 to t=50, we go up through each freeway.\n\nAt t=43, y=1, freeway 1, t=43>42, safe.\n\nt=44, y=2, freeway 2, safe.\n\nt=45, y=3, freeway 3, safe (unsafe only at t=42)\n\nSimilarly, t=46, y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\nt=47, y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\nt=48, y=6, freeway 6, always safe\n\nt=49, y=7, freeway 7, always safe\n\nt=50, y=8, freeway 8, at t=50, dT=10, min(t)= -11 +6*10= -11+60=49, max=60, 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen y51=9.\n\nBut the goal is to reach (0,9), so at turn t=51, position is (0,9), after action at t=50.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=40 to t=50.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nSuppose at t=40, we stay: a40=S, y41=0\n\nThen at t=41, we can go U to y42=1, but at t=42, y=1 unsafe, cannot.\n\nOr at t=41, stay S, y42=0\n\nThen same as before, start going up from t=42.\n\nBut at t=41, we are at y=0, not moving, so we could have gone up at t=40, but then we had to go down at t=41.\n\nIn terms of time, same: if we stay at t=40 and t=41:\n\nt=40: S, y41=0\n\nt=41: S, y42=0\n\nThen t=42: U, y43=1\n\n...\n\nSame as before, reach y=9 at t=51.\n\nIf we go up at t=40 and down at t=41, same thing.\n\nSo no savings.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 faster by going through safe rows at critical times, but no, since we have to pass all rows.\n\nAnother idea: at t=42, if we can be on y=6, but impossible.\n\nOr, we can go directly to a higher row after, but we have to increment y by 1 each time.\n\nUnless we skip some rows by staying, but staying doesn't skip, it delays.\n\nFor example, if at some point we stay, we spend extra turn.\n\nBut here, to avoid t=42 on low rows, we have to be at y=0 at t=42, which costs two turns to stay or go down.\n\nThen 9 up, total 11.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=5 at a different time, but no issue.\n\nI think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 8 at t=40 and t=41.\n\nBut we are not on it.\n\nIn the sequence, when we go to y=8 at t=50, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo minimal H=11.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions.\n\nIn the first approach: actions at each turn.\n\nStart t=40: position y=0, action U, so y41=1\n\nt=41: position y=1, action D, to y42=0\n\nt=42: position y=0, action U, to y43=1\n\nt=43: y=1, action U, to y44=2\n\nt=44: y=2, action U, to y45=3\n\nt=45: y=3, action U, to y46=4\n\nt=46: y=4, action U, to y47=5\n\nt=47: y=5, action U, to y48=6\n\nt=48: y=6, action U, to y49=7\n\nt=49: y=7, action U, to y50=8\n\nt=50: y=8, action U, to y51=9\n\nAt t=51, y=9, reached.\n\nActions from t=40 to t=50.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nH is the number of turns, which is the number of actions.\n\nHere 11 actions.\n\nt_1=40, actions a_{40} to a_{50}.\n\nIn the sequence, t=40 to t=50.\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nBut at t=41, we go down, which might be counterintuitive, but necessary to avoid collision.\n\nWe could stay at t=40 and t=41, but that also takes two turns to be at y=0 at t=42.\n\nThen same number.\n\nBut in that case:\n\nt=40: S, y41=0\n\nt=41: S, y42=0\n\nt=42: U, y43=1\n\n...\n\nsame, reach at t=51.\n\nBut with down, we at least were at y=1 briefly.\n\nBut same H.\n\nNow, in the sequence with down, at t=41, we are on freeway 1 at t=41, which is safe, as established.\n\nThen go down to avoid t=42.\n\nNow, for the answer, I think it's fine.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose at t=40, we go up to y=1.\n\nThen at t=41, we must go down to y=0 to avoid being on low row at t=42.\n\nNo other choice.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=8 or 9 via other means, but no.\n\nAnother thought: the player can stay on a safe row, like y=6 or 7, but we start from 0, so we need to get there first.\n\nBut to reach y=6, min 6 steps, but at t=42, if we are at y=6, it would be safe, but we can't reach in 2 steps.\n\nFor example, to be at y=6 at t=46, as in the sequence.\n\nBut at t=46, we are on y=4 in the sequence, etc.\n\nI think 11 is best.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence where we go up faster after, but no.\n\nSo I'll go with H=11.\n\nNow, for the actions:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{40} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{41} = D  (since t_1 +1 =41)\n\nTurn t_1 +2: a_{42} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +3: a_{43} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +4: a_{44} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +5: a_{45} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +6: a_{46} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +7: a_{47} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +8: a_{48} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +9: a_{49} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +10: a_{50} = U\n\nH=11 actions, from t=40 to t=50.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1 relative, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nHere a_{40} to a_{50}, so H=11.\n\nReach at position after a_{50}, y_{51}=9.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut let's double-check freeway 8 at other times.\n\nFor example, when we go to y=8 at t=50, position at t=50 is y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 at t=50: dT=10, min for second car: min(t)= -11 +6*10=49, max=60, 0 not in, safe.\n\nFirst car not relevant.\n\nSimilarly, all other times, no issue.\n\nAt t=41, when we are at y=1, freeway 1 at t=41: dT=1, min=48-36=12, max=83-36=47, both >0, 0 not in, safe.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think this works.\n\nTo avoid the down move, we can stay at start:\n\nt=40: S, y41=0\n\nt=41: S, y42=0\n\nt=42: U, y43=1\n\n... same as above, but actions S,S,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U\n\nThen a_{40}=S, a_{41}=S, a_{42}=U, ..., a_{50}=U, reach y51=9 same H.\n\nBut with down, we have one up and one down, net zero, same as two stays.\n\nBut in terms of actions, same number.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nBut with down, we moved, but had to move back.\n\nBut for the answer, I'll use the first one.\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n\nThe sequence should be listed as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nWith H=11.\n\nt_1=40.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: D\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nIn the format, it should be written with the turn numbers.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., but in the box, we write the actions with turn numbers.\n\nAlso, in the car list, freeway 8 has a car at (0,-11,right,6), which at t=40, span includes 0, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think that's all.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 40\\) is 11. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a freeway row when it is unsafe at that turn.\n\n### Key Constraints:\n- At turn \\(t = 42\\), freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\) are unsafe due to cars covering position \\(x = 0\\). Thus, the player must not be on rows \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\) at \\(t = 42\\).\n- Starting from \\(y = 0\\) at \\(t = 40\\), the player can only reach \\(y = 0, 1,\\) or \\(2\\) by \\(t = 42\\). Since \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\) are unsafe at \\(t = 42\\), the only safe position at \\(t = 42\\) is \\(y = 0\\).\n- To achieve \\(y = 0\\) at \\(t = 42\\), the player moves up to \\(y = 1\\) at \\(t = 41\\) (safe, as freeway 1 is unsafe only at \\(t = 42\\)) and then down to \\(y = 0\\) at \\(t = 42\\).\n- After \\(t = 42\\), all freeways are safe at the relevant times, allowing the player to move up directly to \\(y = 9\\).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) by:\n- Using a down move at \\(t = 41\\) to avoid the unsafe condition at \\(t = 42\\).\n- Moving up consistently from \\(t = 42\\) to \\(t = 50\\) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at \\(t = 51\\).\n\nActions:\n- At turn 40: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 1\\) (safe, freeway 1 unsafe only at \\(t = 42\\)).\n- At turn 41: Move down (\\(D\\)) to \\(y = 0\\) (safe, avoids being on freeway 1 at \\(t = 42\\)).\n- At turn 42: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 1\\) (safe, freeway 1 unsafe only at \\(t = 42\\)).\n- At turn 43: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 2\\) (safe, freeway 2 unsafe only at \\(t = 42\\)).\n- At turn 44: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 3\\) (safe, freeway 3 unsafe only at \\(t = 42\\)).\n- At turn 45: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 4\\) (safe, freeway 4 unsafe only at \\(t = 42\\)).\n- At turn 46: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 5\\) (safe, freeway 5 unsafe only at \\(t = 42\\)).\n- At turn 47: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 6\\) (safe, freeway 6 always safe).\n- At turn 48: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 7\\) (safe, freeway 7 always safe).\n- At turn 49: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 8\\) (safe, freeway 8 unsafe only at \\(t = 40\\) and \\(t = 41\\); at \\(t = 49\\), \\(dT = 9\\), min = \\(-11 + 6 \\times 9 = 43\\), max = \\(54\\), \\(0 \\notin [43, 54]\\)).\n- At turn 50: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 9\\) (goal reached).\n\nThe player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn \\(51\\) after 11 actions.\n\n### Verification:\n- **Collision avoidance**:\n  - At \\(t = 41\\), on freeway 1: car span min = \\(48 - 36 \\times 1 = 12\\), max = \\(83 - 36 \\times 1 = 47\\), \\(0 \\notin [12, 47]\\) (safe).\n  - At \\(t = 42\\), on \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway row).\n  - From \\(t = 43\\) to \\(t = 50\\), the relevant freeways are safe as per their unsafe times (only \\(t = 42\\) for \\(y = 1-5\\), and \\(t = 40-41\\) for \\(y = 8\\)).\n- **Minimal turns**: Any fewer than 11 turns would require reaching \\(y = 9\\) by \\(t = 49\\) (9 actions), but this is impossible due to the constraint at \\(t = 42\\) forcing \\(y = 0\\) and the need for 9 up moves from there.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 40: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 41: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 42: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 43: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 44: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 45: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 46: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 47: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 48: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 50: U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The current turn is t_1 = 42, and I start at y=0. I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, but I must stay within y=0 to 9.\n\nCollisions happen only if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn. The span changes linearly with time based on speed and direction.\n\nAlso, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1. So I don't get hit by cars on the new row until I'm actually there.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car positions and how they move over time.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway. Freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nFor y=1: one car: head -24, tail 11, left direction, speed 36.\n\nSince it's left-moving, and span is [h, τ] with h > τ? In the update, for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] and at T, it's [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nHere h = -24, τ = 11? That seems odd because -24 < 11, so if it's left-moving, the head should be on the left, I think. Let me read carefully.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut if h and τ are positions, for left-moving, the car is moving left, so if we think of x-axis, decreasing x.\n\nBut here, head and tail: I think head is the front, tail is the back.\n\nFor left-moving, front is left, so head has smaller x if x decreases left.\n\nBut in the span, [h, τ], if h is head and τ is tail, and left-moving, head should be left, tail right, so if x left is smaller, then h < τ, so span [h, τ] with h < τ.\n\nIn this case, for y=1, h = -24, τ = 11, so -24 < 11, so [ -24, 11 ], which makes sense for a car from x=-24 to x=11 at t_1=42.\n\nThen at time T, since left-moving, span becomes [ -24 - 36*(T-42), 11 - 36*(T-42) ]\n\nSimilarly for y=2: same as y=1, (-24,11,left,36)\n\nNow y=3: three cars: (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the notation: for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h] with arrow to [τ + s dt, h + s dt]\n\nAnd in the description, for right-moving: [τ, h] with h being head, τ tail, so head should be right, tail left, so τ < h.\n\nIn this car, (-48,-59,right,12), but -48 and -59, if τ = -48, h = -59? -48 > -59, so τ = -48, h = -59, but τ should be tail, h head, so for right-moving, head should be greater than tail? Let's see.\n\nτ = -48, h = -59, but -48 > -59, so if τ is tail and h is head, and right-moving, head should be to the right, so if x increases right, head should have higher x.\n\nHere τ = -48, h = -59, -59 < -48, so h < τ, which would mean head left of tail, which is inconsistent.\n\nI think there's a confusion in notation.\n\nLook back at the car state:\n\nFor y=3: \"(-48, -59, right, 12)\" and it says (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nBut in the update rule, for right-moving, it uses Span(t_1) = [τ, h] which implies that τ is the left end and h is the right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h left, τ right.\n\nIn the text: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nBut for right-moving, head should be the front, which is right, so h should be greater than τ if x increases right.\n\nFor the first car on y=3: head h = -48, tail τ = -59, direction right, speed 12.\n\nBut h = -48, τ = -59, since -48 > -59, so head at -48, tail at -59, but -59 is left of -48, so if head is at -48 and tail at -59, that means the car is from x=-59 to x=-48, so left end τ=-59, right end h=-48.\n\nThen for right-moving, it should be moving right, so at time T, span [τ + s dt, h + s dt] = [-59 + 12*(T-42), -48 + 12*(T-42)]\n\nSimilarly, the update rule says for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSo τ is tail, which is left end, h is head, right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h head (left end), τ tail (right end).\n\nIn y=1, head h=-24, tail τ=11, so left end -24, right end 11.\n\nFor y=3 cars:\n\nFirst car: head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed 12. Since right-moving, τ is tail (left), h is head (right), so τ=-59, h=-48.\n\nSo span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T: [ -59 + 12*(T-42), -48 + 12*(T-42) ]\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,12) head=36, tail=25, so τ=25, h=36? head h=36, tail τ=25, since 36>25, so τ=25 (left), h=36 (right), span at t_1: [25,36]\n\nAt T: [25 + 12*(T-42), 36 + 12*(T-42)]\n\nThird car: (0,-11,right,12) head=0, tail=-11, so τ=-11, h=0, span at t_1: [-11,0]\n\nAt T: [-11 + 12*(T-42), 0 + 12*(T-42)]\n\nSimilarly for y=4 and y=5, same as y=3: three cars with same parameters.\n\ny=4: same as y=3, (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\ny=5: same.\n\nNow y=6: one car (60,49,right,6) head=60, tail=49, τ=49, h=60, span [49,60] at t_1, at T: [49 + 6*(T-42), 60 + 6*(T-42)]\n\ny=7: same as y=6, (60,49,right,6)\n\ny=8: two cars: (60,49,right,6) and (12,1,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,6) same as above.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6) head=12, tail=1, so τ=1, h=12, span [1,12] at t_1, at T: [1 + 6*(T-42), 12 + 6*(T-42)]\n\nNow, the collision condition: at turn T, if I am on freeway k, then collision if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at time T.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at t=42, and I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and there are no cars on y=9, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nThe player position is vertical, from y=0 to y=9, and freeways at y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nI start at (0,0) at turn 42, and I need to be at (0,9) at some turn, say T.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H turns, I am at y=9.\n\nLet t be the turn number, starting from t=42.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nI perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=42 to t=42 + H - 1, so H actions, and after H actions, at turn t=42 + H, I am at y=9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 42, I am at y=0.\n\nI choose a_{42}, then at turn 43, y_{43} = y_{42} + Δy_{42} = 0 + Δy_{42}\n\nSimilarly, after H actions, at turn 42 + H, I have y_{42+H} = y_{42} + sum_{k=0}^{H-1} Δy_{42+k}\n\nI want y_{42+H} = 9.\n\nThe minimal H such that I can reach y=9 in H steps from y=0, so H min, y_{42+H} = 9.\n\nSince y starts at 0, to reach 9, I need net +9 in y changes, so sum of Δy = +9.\n\nEach Δy is +1, -1, or 0, so the minimal H is at least 9, if I go up every time.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 9.\n\nBut I need to minimize H, so I should go up as much as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nNow, the collision: when I am on a freeway row y at turn t, I get hit if for that row, at turn t, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nSince the cars are moving, I need to check for each row and each turn if 0 is occupied.\n\nAlso, since I move one row per turn at most, I need to pass through each row from 1 to 8.\n\nBut I can stay on a row or move up or down, so I might not visit all rows, but since I start at 0 and end at 9, and I can only change by 1 each turn, I must pass through rows between 0 and 9, but I can skip some if I move fast, but since I move step by step, I will visit intermediate rows.\n\nFor example, to go from y=0 to y=9, I will be on y=0, then to y=1 or stay, but eventually I need to be on y=1 to y=8 at some points.\n\nAt each turn, I am on a specific y, and for that y, if it's between 1 and 8, I check if at that turn, there is a car covering x=0.\n\nx=0 is the position we care about, since player is at (0,y_t).\n\nSo for each freeway row k, at time t, if I am on row k, collision if there is a car on row k with 0 in its span at time t.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at t=42, and y=0 has no cars, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 no cars, safe.\n\nNow, I need to find a path from t=42, y=0 to some t, y=9 with min turns.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row, the times when x=0 is occupied, so that if I am on that row at that time, I get hit.\n\nSince the cars move continuously in time, but time is discrete turns, so we evaluate at integer turns.\n\nt is integer, turn number.\n\nLet t_rel = t - 42, so relative time, starting from 0.\n\nSet τ = t - 42, so at τ=0, t=42.\n\nThen for each car, the span at time τ (relative) is as above.\n\nFirst, for row y=1: one car, left-moving, h=-24, τ=11, s=36.\n\nSpan at τ: [h - s τ, τ - s τ]? t_1=42, T = t_1 + τ, so T - t_1 = τ.\n\nSpan at relative time τ: [h - s τ, τ - s τ] but τ is time, not the tail.\n\nI used τ for time, but in car, τ is tail, conflict.\n\nLet me use u for relative time.\n\nSet u = t - 42, so u=0 at turn 42.\n\nFor row 1 car: span at u: [h - s u, tail - s u] = [-24 - 36 u, 11 - 36 u]\n\nCollision at row 1, time u, if 0 is in [ -24 -36u, 11 -36u ]\n\nSo -24 -36u ≤ 0 ≤ 11 -36u\n\nNow, -24 -36u ≤ 0 ⇒ -36u ≤ 24 ⇒ u ≥ -24/36 = -2/3, since u≥0, always true for u≥0.\n\n0 ≤ 11 -36u ⇒ 36u ≤ 11 ⇒ u ≤ 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nSince u integer, u=0 only.\n\nu=0: -24 ≤ 0 ≤ 11? 0 between -24 and 11, yes.\n\nu=1: [ -24-36, 11-36] = [-60, -25], 0 not in, since -60 to -25 <0.\n\nSimilarly for u>0, more negative, so only at u=0, row 1 has collision at x=0.\n\nBut u=0 is turn t=42.\n\nAt turn t=42, I am at y=0, not on row 1. So when I am on row 1, it might be later.\n\nFor row 1, collision only at u=0, but u=0 is when I am at y=0, not on row 1.\n\nSo for row 1, at any time u≥1, no collision at x=0, because the car has moved left, span left of 0.\n\nSimilarly for row 2: same as row 1, car (-24,11,left,36), so same span, collision only at u=0.\n\nBut at u=0, I am not on row 2, so row 2 is always safe? Let me confirm.\n\nAt u=0, span [-24,11], 0 in it.\n\nBut if I am on row 2 at u=0, I would be hit, but at u=0, I am at y=0, not row 2.\n\nAt u=1, span [-60,-25], 0 not in, and for u>1, worse.\n\nSo row 2 is safe at all times u≥0.\n\nSimilarly row 1: at u=0 collision, but I not there; at u≥1, no collision.\n\nSo row 1 is also safe for u≥1.\n\nNow row 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12) but head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right.\n\nAs per earlier, τ = tail = -59 (left), h = head = -48 (right), so span at u: [τ + s u, h + s u] = [-59 + 12u, -48 + 12u]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-59+12u, -48+12u]\n\nSo -59+12u ≤ 0 ≤ -48+12u\n\nFirst, -59+12u ≤ 0 ⇒ 12u ≤ 59 ⇒ u ≤ 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so u≤4 since u integer\n\nSecond, 0 ≤ -48+12u ⇒ 48 ≤ 12u ⇒ u ≥ 4\n\nSo u=4: -59+48 = -11 ≤ 0 ≤ -48+48=0, so 0 in [-11,0], yes.\n\nu=5: -59+60=1 ≤ 0? 1 ≤ 0 false, and 0 ≤ -48+60=12, but 1 ≤ 0 false, so 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSimilarly, u=3: -59+36= -23 ≤ 0, and 0 ≤ -48+36= -12? 0 ≤ -12 false, so not.\n\nOnly u=4.\n\nSecond car on row 3: (36,25,right,12) head=36, tail=25, so τ=25 (left), h=36 (right), span at u: [25 + 12u, 36 + 12u]\n\n0 in [25+12u, 36+12u]? 25+12u ≤ 0 ≤ 36+12u\n\nBut 25+12u >0 for u≥0, so 0 ≤ ... but left end >0, so 0 not in, since interval positive.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (0,-11,right,12) head=0, tail=-11, τ=-11, h=0, span at u: [-11 + 12u, 0 + 12u] = [-11 + 12u, 12u]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-11+12u, 12u]\n\nSo -11+12u ≤ 0 ≤ 12u\n\nFirst: -11+12u ≤ 0 ⇒ 12u ≤ 11 ⇒ u ≤ 11/12 <1, so u=0\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 12u, u≥0\n\nu=0: -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0? 0≤0 true, so yes, 0 in [-11,0]\n\nu=1: [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for row 3, collisions at u=0 from third car, and at u=4 from first car.\n\nNow at u=0, I am at y=0, not row 3.\n\nSo for row 3, when I am on it, collision possible at u=4.\n\nSimilarly, row 4 and row 5 same as row 3, so same collision times: at u=0 and u=4, but u=0 not relevant, so at u=4, collision if on row 4 or 5.\n\nNow row 6: one car (60,49,right,6) head=60, tail=49, τ=49, h=60, span [49+6u, 60+6u]\n\n0 in [49+6u,60+6u]? 49+6u >0, so no, always safe.\n\nSimilarly row 7: same, safe.\n\nNow row 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,6) same as row 6, span [49+6u,60+6u], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6) head=12, tail=1, τ=1, h=12, span [1+6u, 12+6u]\n\n0 in [1+6u,12+6u]? 1+6u ≥1 >0 for u≥0, so no, 0 not in.\n\nThus row 8 is always safe.\n\nSummary of dangerous times for each row:\n\n- Row 1: collision at u=0 only, but u=0 not when on row, so safe for u≥1\n\n- Row 2: same, safe always\n\n- Row 3: collision at u=4\n\n- Row 4: same as row 3, collision at u=4\n\n- Row 5: same, collision at u=4\n\n- Row 6: safe always\n\n- Row 7: safe always\n\n- Row 8: safe always\n\nRows 3,4,5 have a collision at u=4 (relative time, t=42+4=46)\n\nAt u=4, if I am on row 3,4, or 5, I get hit.\n\nOtherwise, all rows are safe at all other times.\n\nI need to go from y=0 at u=0 to y=9 at some u.\n\nMinimal H: if no obstacles, I can go up 9 times in 9 turns, so at u=9, y=9.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on rows 3,4,5 at u=4.\n\nu=4 is turn t=46.\n\nAt u=4, I must not be on y=3,4, or 5.\n\nSince I start at u=0, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe critical point is at time u=4.\n\nI should not be on rows 3-5 at u=4.\n\nPossible strategies:\n\n- Be below row 3 at u=4, i.e., y≤2\n\n- Or above row 5, y≥6\n\nSince rows 1 and 2 are safe, and 6,7,8 safe.\n\ny=0,1,2 or y=6,7,8 or y=9 at u=4.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, but at u=4, I might not be there yet.\n\nNow, from u=0 to u=4, I have 4 actions: from turn 42 to 45, actions a42 to a45, determining y at u=4.\n\nAt u=0 (t=42), y=0.\n\nAfter 4 actions, at u=4 (t=46), y_{46} = y_{42} + Δy_{42} + Δy_{43} + Δy_{44} + Δy_{45}\n\nSince y_{42}=0, y_{46} = sum_{i=0}^{3} Δy_{42+i}\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,+1, so y_{46} can be from -4 to 4, but since y>=0, and we start at 0, min y=0 if all down or stay, but y>=0, so if I go down at y=0, y stays 0, since y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, but y in [0,9], so if y=0 and D, y_{t+1}= max(0, 0-1)=0, similarly at y=9 and U, y=9.\n\nSo y_{46} can be 0 to 4.\n\nSimilarly, I need y_{46} not in {3,4,5}, so y_{46} must be 0,1,2 or 6,7,8.\n\nBut since max y_{46} is 4 if I go up all 4 times, I cannot reach y=6,7,8 in 4 steps from y=0; max is y=4.\n\ny=4 after 4 ups.\n\nMin is y=0.\n\nSo possible y at u=4: 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nI need to avoid y=3,4,5, but y=5 impossible in 4 steps, so avoid y=3 and y=4.\n\nThus at u=4, y must be 0,1, or 2.\n\ny=2 is possible with two ups and two something, etc.\n\nAfter u=4, I need to go from y_{46} to y=9.\n\ny_{46} <=2, and y=9, so I need to gain at least 7 more in y.\n\nEach up gains 1, so I need at least 7 more actions to gain 7, but I might stay or go down, so more.\n\nBut since I want min H, I should minimize the time after u=4.\n\nBut first, let's list the actions.\n\nH is the number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 42+H, y=9.\n\nThe actions are from t=42 to t=42+H-1.\n\nSet the turns.\n\nLet the sequence start from turn 42.\n\nAt turn 42: position y=0\n\nAction a_42, then y_43 = y_42 + Δy_42\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{42+H-1}, y_{42+H} = 9.\n\nThe time from start to end is H turns, but the position after H actions is at time t=42+H.\n\nRelative time u from 0 to H.\n\nAt u=0, t=42, y=0\n\nAt u=H, t=42+H, y=9\n\nAt intermediate u, y_u.\n\nThe collision at u=4 must be avoided, so at u=4, y_4 not in {3,4,5}, so y_4 <=2.\n\ny_4 is after 4 steps, at time u=4.\n\ny_4 = sum of first 4 Δy, from u=0 to u=3 actions? Let's see.\n\nAt u=0 (after 0 actions), y=0\n\nAfter action a_{42} (first action), at u=1, y_1\n\nGenerally, after k actions, at u=k, y_k\n\nAt u=0, y=0\n\nAfter a_{42}, at u=1, y_1\n\nAfter a_{43}, at u=2, y_2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{42+k-1}, at u=k, y_k\n\nWe want y_H = 9.\n\nThe critical time is at u=4, y_4 must not be 3,4,5, so y_4 <=2.\n\nSince y_4 <=2, and y_0=0, y_4 <=2.\n\nThe minimal y_4 is 0, max is 4, but we need <=2.\n\nAfter that, from y_4 <=2 to y_H=9, need to increase by at least 7, so at least 7 up actions.\n\nH must be at least 4 + 7 = 11, since first 4 actions get to y<=2, then at least 7 to reach 9.\n\nBut I might reach earlier if I can go faster, but since y_4<=2, and y=9, difference at least 7, so min H is 11 if I go up all the way after, but I need to check if possible without collision.\n\nFirst, can I achieve y_4 <=2 with min actions, but since I need to go up later, I might not need min actions to y_4, but for min H, I should make y_4 as high as possible under <=2, so y_4=2, then I need only 7 more to 9.\n\nIf y_4=0, I need 9 more, H larger.\n\nSo best to have y_4=2.\n\nThen after that, go up 7 times to y=9.\n\nBut I need to ensure no other collisions.\n\nNow, rows 6,7,8 are always safe, and rows 1,2 are safe except at u=0 but not relevant.\n\nRows 3,4,5 only dangerous at u=4, which we avoid by not being there.\n\nAfter u=4, all rows safe at all times, since only u=4 was critical.\n\nFor example, row 3: at u=4 collision, but at other u, no collision.\n\nSimilarly for 4 and 5.\n\nAnd other rows safe always.\n\nSo after u=4, no danger, I can move freely.\n\nTherefore, the plan: at u=4, be at y=2.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9 in 7 steps.\n\ny at u=4 is 2.\n\nThen at u=5, y=3; u=6,y=4; ... up to u=11, y=9? Let's see.\n\nStart: u=0, y=0\n\nAfter 4 actions: at u=4, y=2\n\nThen actions: to reach y=9, I need to gain 7 from y=2.\n\nAfter k actions from u=4, at u=4+k, y_{4+k} = y_4 + sum of Δy from u=4 to u=4+k-1 actions.\n\nSet after m actions from start.\n\nAt u=4, after 4 actions, y=2.\n\nThen I need y_H=9.\n\ny_H = y_4 + sum_{i=4}^{H-1} Δy_i ? Indices.\n\ny at time u: y_u\n\ny_u = y_{u-1} + Δy_{u-1}? Better to think of actions.\n\nAfter action at time t, y changes.\n\nAt turn t=42, y=0\n\nChoose a_{42}, then at t=43, y= y_42 + Δy_42\n\nSimilarly, at turn t, after action a_{t-1} or something.\n\nDefine: at turn t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t chosen at turn t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nAt t=42, y_{42} = 0\n\na_{42} chosen, y_{43} = y_{42} + Δy_{42}\n\na_{43}, y_{44} = y_{43} + Δy_{43}\n\n...\n\na_{t}, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nWe want y_{42 + H} = 9, so after H actions, from t=42 to t=41+H, y_{42+H} =9.\n\nThe actions are a_{42} to a_{42+H-1}, H actions.\n\nRelative u: at u=0, t=42, y=0\n\nAfter action a_{42}, at u=1, t=43, y=y1\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{42+k-1}, at u=k, t=42+k, y=y_k\n\nAt u=4, t=46, y_4 must be <=2.\n\nThen y_H =9.\n\nNow, from u=4 to u=H, y increases from y_4 to 9, so number of steps: from u=4 to u=H, there are H-4 actions? From u=4 to u=H, the actions at u=4 to u=H-1 determine the change to y_H.\n\ny_H = y_4 + sum_{i=4}^{H-1} Δy_i  ? i is index.\n\nThe actions from k=4 to H-1: actions at relative time u, when we perform action at u, it affects y_{u+1}.\n\nAt state u, we perform action a_u, then go to u+1 with y_{u+1} = y_u + Δy_u.\n\nSo to have y_H =9, with y_4 <=2.\n\nThe net gain from u=4 to u=H is 9 - y_4 >= 7 since y_4 <=2.\n\nThe number of actions between u=4 and u=H is from action at u=4 to action at u=H-1, which is (H-1) - 4 + 1 = H-4 actions.\n\nEach action contributes to Δy, and y_H = y_4 + sum_{k=4}^{H-1} Δy_k\n\nSince each |Δy| <=1, the min number of actions to gain G is G, if all up.\n\nHere G = 9 - y_4 >=7.\n\nTo minimize H, we should maximize y_4, so y_4=2, then G=7, and min actions 7, so H-4 =7? Number of actions from u=4 to u=H-1 is H-4.\n\nAfter H-4 actions, from y_4 to y_H, with y_H = y_4 + sum of H-4 deltas.\n\nIf all up, y_H = y_4 + (H-4)\n\nSet equal to 9, so y_4 + (H-4) =9\n\nIf y_4=2, then 2 + H -4 =9, so H-2=9, H=11.\n\nSimilarly, if y_4=1, 1 + H-4 =9, H-3=9, H=12, worse.\n\ny_4=0, H=13, worse.\n\nSo best y_4=2, H=11.\n\nWith H=11 actions: from u=0 to u=10, actions a42 to a51, y at u=11, t=53, y=9.\n\ny at u=11 is after 11 actions.\n\nu=0: before any action, y=0\n\nAfter a42 (action at u=0), y at u=1\n\n...\n\nAfter a52 (action at u=10), y at u=11\n\nWe want y_{11} =9.\n\nWith y_4=2 at u=4.\n\nThen from u=4 to u=11, 7 actions, if all up, y_{11} = y_4 + 7 = 2+7=9, perfect.\n\nNow, need to achieve y_4=2.\n\nFrom u=0 to u=4, 4 actions to go from y=0 to y=2.\n\ny_4 = y_0 + sum_{k=0}^{3} Δy_k = sum of first 4 deltas.\n\nSince y_0=0.\n\nTo have y_4=2, I need net +2 in 4 actions, so I can have, for example, two U and two S, or one U and one D and two S? But net +2.\n\nPossible sequences: U,U,S,S or U,S,U,S etc., or U,U,D,U? But D would decrease, so to net +2 in 4 actions, I must have exactly two U and two S, or three U and one D? Three U and one D: net +2, since +3-1=+2.\n\nSimilarly, four U: y=4, too high.\n\nTwo U and two S: net +2.\n\nOne U and one D and two S: net 0, not +2.\n\n+1 -1 +0 +0 =0.\n\nSo to net +2: either two U and two S, or three U and one D.\n\nBut since y must be integer and between 0 and 9, and we start from 0.\n\nNow, we need to avoid being on rows 3,4,5 at u=4, but since we are going to y=2 at u=4, which is row 2, not 3,4,5, so safe.\n\nAlso, during the path, we need to ensure no collisions at other times.\n\nNow, for the first part, from u=0 to u=4, we are moving from y=0 to y=2.\n\nAt each step, we are on some row at that turn.\n\nFor example, at u=0, t=42, y=0, safe.\n\nThen after action, at u=1, t=43, y=y1, and so on.\n\nNow, rows 1 and 2 are safe at all times, as we established.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe, but y=9 not yet.\n\nSo when we are on y=1 or 2, no danger.\n\nBut if I go to y=3,4,5 at some other time, it might be safe, since only u=4 is dangerous for those rows.\n\nFor example, at u=3, if I am on y=3, is it safe?\n\nFor row 3, collision only at u=4, not at u=3.\n\nAt u=3, relative time u=3, t=45.\n\nFor row 3, at u=3: first car span [-59+12*3, -48+12*3] = [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [25+36,36+36]= [61,72], no.\n\nThird car [-11+12*3, 12*3] = [-11+36,36] = [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nAt u=5, row 3: first car [-59+12*5, -48+60] = [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in? 0<1, not in.\n\nSecond car [25+60,36+60]=[85,96], no\n\nThird car [-11+60,60]=[49,60], no\n\nSo only u=4 dangerous for rows 3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly for other times, safe.\n\nTherefore, I can safely be on rows 3,4,5 at any time except u=4.\n\nIn the first part, to go from y=0 to y=2 in 4 actions, I might pass through other rows, but as long as at u=4 I am not on 3,4,5, and since only u=4 is bad, other times are fine.\n\nFor example, I could go directly to y=2 or via other paths.\n\nBut to have y_4=2.\n\nWith 4 actions, net +2.\n\nI need to specify the actions.\n\nSince rows are safe except at u=4, I can choose any sequence that gets me to y=2 at u=4.\n\nFor example, simplest: all actions to go up, but with y=4 at u=4, but we need y=2, so I need to go slower.\n\nSo I need to have some S or D.\n\nBut D might cause me to go down, but since I start at y=0, I cannot go below, so D at y=0 does nothing.\n\nSimilarly, I can stay or go up.\n\nTo reach y=2 at u=4.\n\nPossible action sequences:\n\nOption 1: two U and two S in some order.\n\nFor example: U, U, S, S\n\nThen:\n\nu=0: y=0, action a42=U, then y at u=1:1\n\nu=1: y=1, action a43=U, y at u=2:2\n\nu=2: y=2, action a44=S, y at u=3:2\n\nu=3: y=2, action a45=S, y at u=4:2\n\nThen at u=4, y=2.\n\nNow, during this, at u=1, y=1, row 1, safe.\n\nu=2, y=2, row 2, safe.\n\nu=3, y=2, row 2, safe.\n\nNo problem.\n\nAnother sequence: U, S, U, S\n\nu=0: y=0, a42=U, y1=1\n\nu=1: y=1, a43=S, y2=1\n\nu=2: y=1, a44=U, y3=2\n\nu=3: y=2, a45=S, y4=2\n\nSame y=2 at u=4.\n\nOr S, U, U, S: but start with S.\n\nu=0: y=0, a42=S, y1=0\n\nu=1: y=0, a43=U, y2=1\n\nu=2: y=1, a44=U, y3=2\n\nu=3: y=2, a45=S, y4=2\n\nAlso fine.\n\nNow, with three U and one D, but since at y=0, D does nothing.\n\nFor example: U, U, U, D\n\nu=0: y=0, a42=U, y1=1\n\nu=1: y=1, a43=U, y2=2\n\nu=2: y=2, a44=U, y3=3\n\nu=3: y=3, a45=D, y4=2\n\nAt u=4, y=2, good.\n\nBut at u=3, y=3, row 3, but u=3, not u=4, so safe, as we checked.\n\nSimilarly, I could have other sequences.\n\nAll fine.\n\nThen after that, from u=4 to u=11, 7 actions all U.\n\nAt u=4, y=2\n\nAction a46=U, then u=5, y=3\n\na47=U, u=6, y=4\n\na48=U, u=7, y=5\n\na49=U, u=8, y=6\n\na50=U, u=9, y=7\n\na51=U, u=10, y=8\n\nThen a52=U, u=11, y=9\n\nNow, during this, from u=5 to u=10, y=3 to 8, but at times u=5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nFor rows: y=3 at u=5, which is safe, since only u=4 dangerous for row 3.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at u=6, row 4, u=6 ≠4, safe.\n\ny=5 at u=7, row 5, u=7≠4, safe.\n\ny=6,7,8 at u=8,9,10, all safe rows.\n\nNo issue.\n\nH=11 actions.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nEarlier I thought min H=11, but perhaps I can be at y=6 or higher at u=4 to reduce H.\n\nBut at u=4, max y=4, which is dangerous, since y=4 at u=4, row 4, collision.\n\ny=3,4,5 all bad at u=4.\n\ny=4 possible with four U, but then at u=4, y=4, which is row 4, and u=4, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\ny=5 impossible in 4 steps.\n\nSo must be y<=2 at u=4.\n\nThus min H=11.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 faster by being at a higher y later, but since I have to avoid u=4 on rows 3-5, and I can only be up to y=4 at u=4, which is forbidden, so I must be low at u=4.\n\nThen go up after.\n\nBut after u=4, all clear, so no need to wait.\n\nThus H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the first part, I need to have y=2 at u=4.\n\nI can choose any sequence that achieves that.\n\nFor simplicity, I can do, for example, U, U, S, S for the first four actions.\n\nThen all U for next seven.\n\nBut in terms of turns.\n\nTurn t=42: action a42\n\nt=43: a43\n\netc.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=42 to t=52, since 11 actions, to reach at t=53.\n\nt=42: start, y=0\n\nAfter a42, t=43, y=?\n\n...\n\nAfter a52, t=53, y=9\n\nActions: a42 to a52.\n\nWith the sequence:\n\nFirst, to have y at u=4 (t=46) be 2.\n\nu=4 corresponds to after action a45? Let's list the times.\n\nAt turn t=42, u=0, y=0\n\nAction a42: then t=43, u=1, y1\n\nAction a43: t=44, u=2, y2\n\nAction a44: t=45, u=3, y3\n\nAction a45: t=46, u=4, y4\n\nWe need y4 =2 at u=4 (t=46)\n\nThen action a46: t=47, u=5, y5\n\n...\n\nAction a52: t=53, u=11, y11=9\n\nFor actions a42 to a45: to have y4=2.\n\nFor example, a42=U, then y1=1\n\na43=U, y2=2\n\na44=S, y3=2 (since at u=3, y=2, after a44)\n\nAfter a44 at t=45, u=3, y=2? When we perform action at t, it sets y_{t+1}.\n\nAt t=42, y=0, perform a42, set y_{43}\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo after performing a42, y_{43} = y_{42} + Δy_{42}\n\nAt time t, y_t is position before action a_t.\n\nStandard: at beginning of turn t, position y_t.\n\nThen choose action a_t, which determines Δy_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, position y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nWith T=42+H, after H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{42+H} =9.\n\nThe actions are taken from turn 42 to 42+H-1.\n\nIn terms of u: at u=0 (t=42), y=0\n\nAfter action a_{42}, y at u=1 (t=43)\n\nAfter action a_{42+u}, y at u+1 (t=43+u)\n\nFor u from 0 to H-1, action a_{42+u}, then y at u+1.\n\nAt u+1, position.\n\nWe want at u=H, y_H =9.\n\nCritical point at u=4, y_4 must be <=2.\n\ny_4 is at time u=4, which is after action a_{42+3}, since after a_{42+u}, y at u+1.\n\nAfter action at u index.\n\nAfter action a_{42 + k} for k=0 to H-1, y at k+1.\n\nSet: after action at relative time v, for v=0 to H-1, we perform action at v, then position at v+1.\n\nAt v=0 (t=42), perform action a_{42}, then position at v=1 (t=43) is y1\n\nAt v=1 (t=43), perform a_{43}, position at v=2 (t=44) y2\n\n...\n\nAt v=m (t=42+m), perform a_{42+m}, position at v=m+1 (t=43+m) y_{m+1}\n\nWe want y_H at v=H.\n\nAt v=4, position y_4 must be <=2.\n\ny_4 at time v=4.\n\nFor H=11, we want y_{11}=9.\n\nNow, y_4 <=2.\n\nWith y_4=2.\n\nThen from v=4 to v=11, positions y_5 to y_11.\n\ny_11 = y_4 + sum_{k=4}^{10} Δy_k ? Let's see the delta.\n\ny_{v} at v is after action at v-1? Better to index the actions.\n\nThe change: from position y_v to y_{v+1} by action at v.\n\ny_{v+1} = y_v + Δy_v\n\nSo to go from y_4 to y_{11}, we need y_{11} = y_4 + sum_{v=4}^{10} Δy_v\n\nSince y_{11} =9, y_4=2, so sum_{v=4}^{10} Δy_v =7\n\nWith 7 actions: from v=4 to v=10, actions a_{46} to a_{52}? v relative.\n\nAction at v: for v=4 to v=10, that's 7 actions: v=4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nAction at v=4 (t=46), sets y_5\n\nAction at v=5 (t=47), sets y_6\n\n...\n\nAction at v=10 (t=52), sets y_{11}\n\ny_{11} = y_4 + Δy_4 + Δy_5 + ... + Δy_{10}\n\nSince y_{11} = y_4 + sum_{i=4}^{10} Δy_i\n\nSet equal to 9, y_4=2, so sum_{i=4}^{10} Δy_i =7\n\nSince all Δy <=1, must all be +1, so all U actions from v=4 to v=10.\n\nSimilarly, for the first part, to have y_4=2.\n\ny_4 at v=4.\n\ny_4 = y_0 + sum_{i=0}^{3} Δy_i = 0 + sum_{i=0}^{3} Δy_i =2\n\nSo sum of Δy for i=0 to 3 (actions at v=0,1,2,3) must be +2.\n\nActions at v=0 (t=42), v=1 (t=43), v=2 (t=44), v=3 (t=45)\n\nEach Δy: +1,0,-1\n\nNet +2 in 4 actions.\n\nPossible with two U and two S, or three U and one D.\n\nSince at y=0, D has no effect, same as S in terms of position, but action is different.\n\nBut for collision, since when we D at y=0, y stays 0, and we are on row y=0, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly S at y=0.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be like:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nWith t_1=42.\n\nNow, H=11, so actions from t=42 to t=52.\n\nt=42 to 52 inclusive, that's 11 actions: t=42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52.\n\nAfter a52, at t=53, y=9.\n\nNow, for the first part, actions at t=42,43,44,45 to set y at t=46 (v=4) to 2.\n\nFor example, I can do:\n\nAt t=42 (v=0): action U, then y at t=43 (v=1) =1\n\nt=43 (v=1): action U, y at t=44 (v=2) =2\n\nt=44 (v=2): action S, y at t=45 (v=3) =2\n\nt=45 (v=3): action S, y at t=46 (v=4) =2\n\nThen t=46 (v=4): action U, y at t=47 (v=5) =3\n\nt=47 (v=5): U, y48=4\n\nt=48 (v=6): U, y49=5\n\nt=49 (v=7): U, y50=6\n\nt=50 (v=8): U, y51=7\n\nt=51 (v=9): U, y52=8\n\nt=52 (v=10): U, y53=9\n\nPerfect.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=46, action U, which is fine.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut in the action sequence, for the first part, I used U,U,S,S.\n\nI could use other, but this is fine.\n\nIn the output, it should be for each turn starting from t_1=42.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: S\n\nTurn 45: S\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nAfter Turn 52 action, at turn 53, y=9.\n\nNow, H=11, from t=42 to t=52 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 44, I have S, y stays 2, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly at 45 S.\n\nI could have, for example, at turn 44 U, but then y=3 at t=45, then at turn 45 D, to y=2 at t=46.\n\nBut that also works, and at t=45, y=3, but u=3 (since at t=45, position, u relative: t=45 is v=3 position? Let's see.\n\nTurn t=45: at beginning, position y? After action.\n\nAt turn t=45, beginning, position y_t.\n\nFor t=45, which is u relative: t=45, since t=42 is u=0, so t=45 is u=3? Let's define u such that at turn t, u=t-42.\n\nSo at turn t, u=t-42.\n\nPosition y at turn t is y_t, with u=t-42.\n\nAt turn t=42, u=0, y=0\n\nAction a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAt turn t+1, u=t+1-42, y_{t+1}\n\nCollision at turn t if on freeway k=y_t, and 0 in car span at time t.\n\nTime t absolute.\n\nIn relative, at relative time u, turn t=42+u.\n\nFor critical, at u=4, t=46.\n\nAt turn t=46, if y=3,4,5, collision.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=46, y=2, safe.\n\nIn the alternative: suppose at t=42: U, y43=1\n\nt=43: U, y44=2\n\nt=44: U, y45=3\n\nBut at t=45, u=3, position y=3, row 3, but time u=3, not dangerous, safe.\n\nThen at t=45: action D, then y46=2\n\nAt t=46, y=2, safe.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nBut this has an extra U and D, but net same, and y_4=2 still.\n\nBut in this case, at t=45, I perform D, which is fine.\n\nBut in terms of number of actions, same H.\n\nI can use the first sequence with S.\n\nNow, in the output, I need to list actions.\n\nSince the problem asks for minimal H, and sequence.\n\nWith H=11, and sequence as above.\n\nBut in the first sequence, at t=44 and t=45, I have S, which might be fine.\n\nTo avoid unnecessary actions, but S is allowed.\n\nAnother sequence: U,S,U,S for first four.\n\nt=42: U, y43=1\n\nt=43: S, y44=1\n\nt=44: U, y45=2\n\nt=45: S, y46=2\n\nThen same as before.\n\nAlso fine.\n\nI think any is ok.\n\nI'll go with the first one.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, for row 8, there is a car (12,1,right,6), which at u=0, span [1,12], but I never on row at u=0 except y=0, so fine.\n\nAll covered.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose H=10, then y_{52} =9? t=42+H, H actions to t=42+H.\n\nAfter H actions, at t=42+H, y=9.\n\nFor H=10, at t=52, y=9.\n\nNow, at u=4, t=46, y must be <=2.\n\nThen from t=46 to t=52, 6 turns later? From y at t=46 to y at t=52.\n\ny_{52} = y_{46} + sum_{t=46}^{51} Δy_t\n\nt from 46 to 51, 6 actions.\n\ny_{52} = y_{46} + sum_{k=46}^{51} Δy_k\n\nSince y_{52}=9, y_{46} <=2, so sum >=7, but only 6 actions, each Δy <=1, so max y_{52} <= y_{46} +6 <= 2+6=8 <9, cannot reach 9.\n\nIf y_{46}=2, y_{52} <=8, less than 9.\n\nIf y_{46}=1, <=7, worse.\n\nSo impossible with H=10.\n\nSimilarly, H=11 is minimal.\n\nThus the sequence.\n\nNow, to write in box.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 42: a_{42}\nTurn 43: a_{43}\n...\n}\n\nWith actions.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: S\n\nTurn 45: S\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nIn the turn numbers: Turn 42 to Turn 52.\n\nBut Turn 52 is the last action.\n\nAfter that, at turn 53, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, I have 11 actions.\n\nTo confirm the positions:\n\nt=42: y=0, action U → t=43: y=1\n\nt=43: y=1, action U → t=44: y=2\n\nt=44: y=2, action S → t=45: y=2\n\nt=45: y=2, action S → t=46: y=2\n\nt=46: y=2, action U → t=47: y=3\n\nt=47: y=3, action U → t=48: y=4\n\nt=48: y=4, action U → t=49: y=5\n\nt=49: y=5, action U → t=50: y=6\n\nt=50: y=6, action U → t=51: y=7\n\nt=51: y=7, action U → t=52: y=8\n\nt=52: y=8, action U → t=53: y=9\n\nAt t=46, y=2, not 3,4,5, safe.\n\nAt other times, no issue.\n\nPerfect.\n\nI could have a shorter sequence but not possible.\n\nSo this should be the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 42\\) is 11, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\nThe critical constraint is that at relative time \\(u = 4\\) (turn \\(t = 46\\)), the player must not be on rows \\(y = 3, 4, 5\\) due to collisions occurring only at that time for those rows. To minimize \\(H\\), the player should be at \\(y = 2\\) at \\(u = 4\\) (turn 46), as this allows reaching \\(y = 9\\) in the fewest subsequent turns. With \\(y = 2\\) at turn 46, 7 upward moves are needed to reach \\(y = 9\\), resulting in \\(H = 11\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions to achieve this is:\n- Turns 42 to 43: Move up to reach \\(y = 2\\) quickly.\n- Turns 44 to 45: Stay to maintain \\(y = 2\\) at turn 46, avoiding rows 3-5.\n- Turns 46 to 52: Move up continuously to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 53.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions:\n- Rows 1 and 2 are safe at all times except \\(u = 0\\) (not relevant as player starts at \\(y = 0\\)).\n- Rows 3, 4, and 5 are only dangerous at \\(u = 4\\), which is avoided by being at \\(y = 2\\).\n- Rows 6, 7, and 8 are always safe.\n- At all other times and positions, no collisions occur.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 42: U \\\\\nTurn 43: U \\\\\nTurn 44: S \\\\\nTurn 45: S \\\\\nTurn 46: U \\\\\nTurn 47: U \\\\\nTurn 48: U \\\\\nTurn 49: U \\\\\nTurn 50: U \\\\\nTurn 51: U \\\\\nTurn 52: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 44, and I start at y=2. I need to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For left-moving cars, the span moves left as time increases, and for right-moving cars, it moves right. The collision happens only if at the turn T, when I'm on a freeway, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, important: when I move to a new y at turn T, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1. So I only check collision for the freeway I'm currently on at each turn.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t = 44, and I need actions from t=44 onwards.\n\nPosition at turn t: y_t\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with U: +1, D: -1, S: 0.\n\nI start at t=44, y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9, so I need to go up 7 units. Each U move increases y by 1, so minimum moves would be 7 Ups, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 7.\n\nBut since I can only move one step at a time, and I need to go from 2 to 9, that's +7, so even if I go straight up with no stops, it would take 7 turns: from t=44 to t=50, y=2 to y=9, arriving at t=50 if I start moving at t=44.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nI take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, I am on freeway y_t.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on y_T and the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nFor example, at t=44, I am on y=2, so I need to check if there is a car on freeway 2 at t=44 with 0 in its span.\n\nSimilarly, when I move, at turn t, I am on y_t, and after action, at turn t+1, I am on y_{t+1}.\n\nNow, the cars: let's list all cars for each freeway at turn t=44.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nGiven:\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (48,83, left, 36)\n\nSince it's left-moving, span at t=44: head 48, tail 83? That seems odd. Head and tail: for left-moving, it says span(t1) = [h, τ], and then at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut here head 48, tail 83, but if it's moving left, head should be on the left, I think? Let's see the direction.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], and h and τ are positions.\n\nBut in this case, for freeway 1: h=48, τ=83, left, s=36.\n\nBut if it's moving left, and h=48, τ=83, that would mean the head is at 48, tail at 83, but if it's moving left, the tail should be on the right, so positions decreasing as we go left.\n\nPerhaps I need to interpret the span.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], and at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, the head is the leftmost point? I think there might be inconsistency.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, it's given as (head h, tail τ), so h is head, τ is tail.\n\nFor left-moving, head is the front when moving left, so head is left, tail is right? I think I need to clarify.\n\nTypically, for a car moving left, the head (front) is on the left, tail (rear) on the right, so span from left to right is [head, tail], with head < tail if x increases to the right.\n\nBut in the update, for left-moving, [h - s dt, τ - s dt], so both decrease, meaning the car moves left.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ + s dt, h + s dt], both increase, moving right.\n\nIn the input, for freeway 1: (48,83, left, 36)\n\nSo at t=44, span is [48,83], so head at 48, tail at 83, so the car is from x=48 to x=83, and moving left.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (48,83, left, 36)\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars: (-24,-35, right,12), (60,49, right,12), (24,13, right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, the span is given as (tail τ, head h), I think, but in the notation it says (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nLook: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nThen for right-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" so for right-moving, τ is tail, h is head, and tail should be left, head right, so [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for dir right, head is right, tail is left, so span [tail, head] = [τ, h].\n\nSimilarly for left, dir left, head left, tail right, span [head, tail] = [h, τ].\n\nIn freeway 3, all cars are right-moving.\n\nFirst car: head h=-24, tail τ=-35? That can't be right because for right-moving, head should be greater than tail.\n\nh=-24, τ=-35, so tail τ=-35, head h=-24, so since τ < h, span [τ, h] = [-35, -24], and it's moving right with s=12.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (60,49, right,12) — head=60, tail=49, but if right-moving, head should be larger than tail, but 60 > 49, so tail=49, head=60, so span [49,60].\n\nIn the tuple, it's (head, tail), so for right-moving, head=60, tail=49, meaning head is at 60, tail at 49, so since moving right, tail left, head right, so positions from 49 to 60.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (24,13, right,12), head=24, tail=13, span [13,24].\n\nBut in the list, it's written as (head, tail), so for right-moving, head > tail, I assume.\n\nIn the first car, head=-24, tail=-35, -24 > -35, yes.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 4 and 5, same as 3: three cars each, all right-moving with s=12.\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3: (-24,-35,right,12), (60,49,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\nSimilarly freeway 5 same.\n\nFreeway 6: one car (-42,-53,right,6) — head=-42, tail=-53, since -42 > -53, span [-53,-42], moving right s=6.\n\nFreeway 7: same as 6, (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (-42,-53,right,6) and (24,13,right,6) — first car head=-42, tail=-53, span [-53,-42] moving right s=6; second car head=24, tail=13, span [13,24] moving right s=6.\n\nNow, I need to find when a car on a freeway has 0 in its span at a given turn T.\n\nCollision if at turn T, for the freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nSince the player is at x=0 always, I think.\n\nThe position is (0, y_t), so x=0 always, only y changes.\n\nSo at turn T, on freeway k = y_T, we need that for no car on freeway k at turn T, 0 is in the span.\n\n0 should not be in any span for that freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, for a car, span at time T: since current time t1=44, let dt = T - 44.\n\nFor left-moving car: span at T: [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt]\n\nFor right-moving car: span at T: [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt]\n\n0 in span means for left-moving: h - s*dt <= 0 <= τ - s*dt\n\nSince h <= τ for left-moving? In freeway 1, h=48, τ=83, so h=48 < τ=83, so for left-moving, h < τ usually? Not necessarily, but in this case yes.\n\nIn general, for left-moving, span [h, τ] with h <= τ, I think, but it could be equal, but car has length.\n\nIn this input, for left-moving, h and τ, with h <= τ? Freeway 1: h=48, τ=83, 48<83.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, in the span [τ, h] with τ <= h.\n\nIn freeway 3 cars, for example, (-24,-35,right), τ=-35, h=-24, -35 < -24, so τ < h.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo in general, for left-moving car, span [L, R] at t1 with L = h, R = τ, L <= R.\n\nAt T, span [L - s dt, R - s dt]\n\n0 in span iff L - s dt <= 0 <= R - s dt\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, span [L, R] at t1 with L = τ, R = h, L <= R.\n\nAt T, [L + s dt, R + s dt]\n\n0 in span iff L + s dt <= 0 <= R + s dt\n\nNow, I need for each freeway and each turn, to know if at x=0, it is occupied by a car.\n\nBut since multiple cars, I need to check for each car on that freeway.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and their positions over time.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: only one car, left-moving, s=36, at t=44: L=48, R=83\n\nAt time T, dt = T-44, span [48 - 36 dt, 83 - 36 dt]\n\n0 in span if 48 - 36 dt <= 0 <= 83 - 36 dt\n\nSince 48 - 36 dt <= 0 <= 83 - 36 dt\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36 dt <= 0 => 36 dt >= 48 => dt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so dt >= 2 since integer? dt is integer, turns are discrete.\n\nT and t1 are integers, I assume, since turns.\n\nIn the game, turns are discrete, so dt integer.\n\nSo for freeway 1, 0 in span when:\n\n48 - 36 dt <= 0 and 0 <= 83 - 36 dt\n\nFrom 48 - 36 dt <= 0: dt >= 48/36 = 4/3, so since dt integer, dt >= 2\n\nFrom 0 <= 83 - 36 dt: 36 dt <= 83, dt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so dt <= 2\n\nThus dt >=2 and dt <=2, so only at dt=2, i.e., T=44+2=46\n\nAt T=46, span: L=48-36*2=48-72=-24, R=83-72=11? 83-72=11, so [-24,11], 0 is between -24 and 11, yes.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nFor example, dt=1: L=48-36=12, R=83-36=47, [12,47], 0 not in.\n\ndt=3: L=48-108=-60, R=83-108=-25, [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=46, on freeway 1, there is a car at x=0.\n\nFreeway 2 is same as freeway 1: (48,83,left,36), so same, only collision at T=46.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars, all right-moving, s=12.\n\nFirst car: at t=44, (head, tail) = (-24,-35,right,12), so for right-moving, span [τ, h] = [-35, -24] at t=44.\n\nAt T, dt=T-44, span [-35 + 12 dt, -24 + 12 dt]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 12 dt <= 0 <= -24 + 12 dt\n\nSo -35 + 12 dt <= 0 and 0 <= -24 + 12 dt\n\nFirst: -35 + 12 dt <= 0 => 12 dt <= 35 => dt <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so dt <= 2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 + 12 dt => 12 dt >= 24 => dt >= 2\n\nThus dt >=2 and dt <=2, so only at dt=2, T=46\n\nAt T=46, span: -35 + 24 = -11, -24 + 24 =0, so [-11,0], 0 is included.\n\nNow second car on freeway 3: (60,49,right,12), head=60, tail=49, so span [49,60] at t=44.\n\nAt T, [49 + 12 dt, 60 + 12 dt]\n\n0 in span? 49 + 12 dt <= 0 <= 60 + 12 dt? But 49 + 12 dt >= 49 >0, so left end >0, so 0 not <= left end, so never 0 in span. Similarly, min is 49 at dt=0, so always positive, never at 0.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (24,13,right,12), span [13,24] at t=44, at T [13+12dt,24+12dt], always >=13>0, so never at 0.\n\nSo for freeway 3, only the first car causes collision at T=46.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4: same cars as freeway 3, so collision only at T=46 from the first car.\n\nFreeway 5: same, collision only at T=46.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car (-42,-53,right,6), head=-42, tail=-53, so span [τ,h] = [-53,-42] at t=44.\n\nAt T, [-53 + 6 dt, -42 + 6 dt]\n\n0 in span if -53 + 6 dt <= 0 <= -42 + 6 dt\n\nSo -53 + 6 dt <= 0 => 6 dt <= 53 => dt <= 53/6 ≈ 8.833, dt <= 8\n\nAnd 0 <= -42 + 6 dt => 6 dt >= 42 => dt >= 7\n\nThus dt >=7 and dt <=8, so T=44+7=51 and T=44+8=52\n\nAt T=51, dt=7: -53+42= -11, -42+42=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=52, dt=8: -53+48= -5, -42+48=6, so [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nOther times not.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6, so collision at T=51 and 52.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-42,-53,right,6), same as above, so at T, span [-53 +6dt, -42 +6dt], collision when dt=7 or 8, T=51 or 52.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,6), head=24, tail=13, span [13,24] at t=44, at T [13+6dt, 24+6dt], always >=13>0, never at 0.\n\nSo for freeway 8, only the first car causes collision at T=51 and 52.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when it is occupied at x=0:\n\n- Freeway 1: occupied only at T=46\n\n- Freeway 2: same, only at T=46\n\n- Freeway 3: occupied at T=46\n\n- Freeway 4: occupied at T=46\n\n- Freeway 5: occupied at T=46\n\n- Freeway 6: occupied at T=51,52\n\n- Freeway 7: occupied at T=51,52\n\n- Freeway 8: occupied at T=51,52\n\nNow, freeway 0 and 9 are not freeways, I think, only y=1 to 8 have cars, and y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since no cars mentioned.\n\nThe grid is y=0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 no cars, so no collision possible there.\n\nNow, I start at y=2 at t=44.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nSince I start at y=2, and need to reach y=9, I must pass through y=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut I can stay or move down, but that might increase time.\n\nThe minimal H is at least 7, since from y=2 to y=9, difference 7, each U move increases y by 1.\n\nBut I might need to wait or detour to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, collisions happen at specific turns on specific freeways.\n\nSpecifically, at T=46, freeways 1,2,3,4,5 are occupied, so if I am on any of these at T=46, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at T=51 and 52, freeways 6,7,8 are occupied.\n\nNow, I need to plan my path so that at each turn, when I am on a freeway y, it is not occupied at that turn.\n\nSince I start at t=44 on y=2.\n\nAt t=44, I am on y=2, is it occupied? Freeway 2 at t=44.\n\nFrom above, freeway 2 is occupied only at T=46, so at t=44, it should be safe.\n\nCheck: freeway 2 at t=44: car span [48,83] for left-moving, at t=44, [48,83], 0 not in, since 48>0.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways at t=44: for example freeway 3, car spans at t=44: [-35,-24], [49,60], [13,24], none contain 0.\n\nSimilarly others, all safe at t=44.\n\nSo at t=44, on y=2, safe.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nLet me consider the turns.\n\nSuppose I want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nStart at t=44, y=2.\n\nI can take action U, D, or S.\n\nIf I take U at t=44, then y_{45} = 3.\n\nAt t=45, I am on y=3.\n\nNow, at t=45, is freeway 3 occupied? Freeway 3 occupied only at T=46, so at t=45, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=4 at t=46, but at t=46, freeway 4 is occupied.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nI need to avoid being on freeways 1-5 at t=46, and on freeways 6-8 at t=51 and t=52.\n\nAlso, since I start from y=2, and y=9 is target.\n\nFirst, the critical turn is t=46.\n\nAt t=46, if I am on any of y=1,2,3,4,5, I collide.\n\nSo I must not be on y=1 to 5 at t=46.\n\nSimilarly, at t=51 and 52, I must not be on y=6,7,8.\n\nNow, y=0 and y=9 are safe always.\n\nNow, I start at t=44, y=2.\n\nt=44: y=2\n\nt=45: depending on action at t=44\n\nt=46: depending on action at t=45\n\netc.\n\nI need to be not on y=1-5 at t=46.\n\nSince at t=44, y=2, I can move up, down, or stay.\n\nIf I move up to y=3 at t=45, or stay at y=2, or down to y=1.\n\nBut at t=46, I must not be on y=1-5.\n\nSo possible ways:\n\n- Be on y=0 at t=46\n\n- Or on y=6 or above at t=46\n\nBut y=6 is freeway 6, which might have issues later.\n\nSince y=0 is safe, I could go to y=0 at some point.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, no cars.\n\nSimilarly y=9 top.\n\nNow, from y=2 at t=44.\n\nAt t=44, I take action.\n\nIf I take U: at t=45, y=3\n\nThen at t=45, I take action, say U again, to y=4 at t=46, but at t=46, y=4, which is in 1-5, collision.\n\nIf I take S at t=45, y=3 at t=46, still collision.\n\nIf I take D at t=45, y=2 at t=46, collision.\n\nSo if I go to y=3 at t=45, then whatever I do at t=45, at t=46 I am on y=2,3, or4, all in 1-5, collision.\n\nIf at t=44 I take S, then at t=45, y=2 (since S, no move)\n\nThen at t=45, same problem, if I take U, to y=3 at t=46; S, y=2; D, y=1; all collision at t=46.\n\nIf at t=44 I take D, to y=1 at t=45.\n\nThen at t=45, on y=1.\n\nNow at t=45, I take action.\n\nIf I take U, to y=2 at t=46, collision.\n\nIf S, y=1 at t=46, collision.\n\nIf D, to y=0 at t=46.\n\ny=0 is safe, no cars.\n\nSo possible: go down to y=0 at t=46.\n\nThen at t=46, I am on y=0, safe.\n\nNow, from there, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut I have to avoid the later collisions at t=51,52 on y=6-8.\n\nNow, time: current t=44.\n\nAfter going down, at t=46, y=0.\n\nThen from t=46 onwards, I need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal time to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 turns: at t=46, y=0; after 9 U, at t=55, y=9.\n\nBut I need to be careful when I pass through y=6,7,8 around t=51,52.\n\nt=51 and 52 are critical.\n\nSince I start from t=46 y=0.\n\nLet me see the time.\n\nt=46: y=0\n\nThen I can start moving up.\n\nEach U move increases y by 1 per turn.\n\nIf I go up continuously:\n\nt=46: y=0\n\na_t: U, t=47: y=1\n\nU, t=48: y=2\n\nU, t=49: y=3\n\nU, t=50: y=4\n\nU, t=51: y=5\n\nAt t=51, y=5, freeway 5 is occupied? Freeway 5 occupied at t=51?\n\nFrom earlier, freeway 5 has collision only at t=46, not at other times.\n\nLet's confirm.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 3,4, occupied only at t=46.\n\nAt t=51, is it occupied?\n\nFor freeway 5, cars: like freeway 3, only collision at t=46.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 1-5 only have collision at t=46, so at t=51, they are all safe.\n\nOnly freeways 6,7,8 have collision at t=51 and 52.\n\nSo at t=51, y=5, freeway 5, no collision.\n\nBut I need to go higher.\n\nContinue:\n\nt=51: y=5, safe\n\na_t=U, t=52: y=6\n\nNow t=52, y=6, freeway 6 is occupied at t=52? Yes, freeway 6 occupied at t=51 and 52.\n\nAt t=52, if I am on y=6, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=7 or 8.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt t=52, y=6, occupied.\n\nIf at t=51, I am on y=5, and I take U to y=6 at t=52.\n\nBut at t=52, y=6, collision.\n\nIf I stay at y=5 at t=52, but at t=51, y=5 is fine, but at t=52, if I stay, y=5, which is fine, since no collision.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nBut at t=52, freeways 6,7,8 occupied, so I cannot be on them at t=52.\n\nSo at t=52, I must be on y<=5 or y=9, but y=9 not yet.\n\ny=0 to 5 or y=9, but y=9 not reached.\n\nSo at t=52, I can be on y=0,1,2,3,4,5, all safe since no cars or no collision.\n\nSimilarly, at t=51, freeways 6,7,8 occupied, so I cannot be on y=6,7,8 at t=51.\n\nIn the path above:\n\nt=50: y=4 (if I go up from t=46)\n\nt=46: y=0\n\nt=47: y=1\n\nt=48: y=2\n\nt=49: y=3\n\nt=50: y=4\n\nt=51: now at t=51, I am on y=4? Let's see actions.\n\nAt t=50, y=4, I take action for t=50, which determines y_{51}.\n\nAt t=50, I am on y=4, which is safe.\n\nI can take U, then y_{51} =5\n\nAt t=51, I am on y=5, which is freeway 5, and at t=51, it is safe, since only collision at t=46.\n\nThen at t=51, I am on y=5.\n\nNow, I need to take action for t=51.\n\nIf I take U, to y=6 at t=52.\n\nBut at t=52, y=6, occupied, collision.\n\nIf I take S, stay at y=5 at t=52, which is safe.\n\nIf I take D, to y=4 at t=52, safe.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nNow, the occupancy at t=51 and t=52 is on y=6,7,8.\n\nSpecifically, at t=51, if I am on y=6,7,8, collision.\n\nAt t=52, same.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on y=6,7,8 at turns t=51 and t=52.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI am at t=51, on y=5.\n\nIf I stay at t=51, action S, then at t=52, I am still on y=5, safe.\n\nThen at t=52, I can take U, to y=6 at t=53.\n\nNow t=53, y=6, is it occupied?\n\nFreeway 6 occupied only at t=51 and 52, so at t=53, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen I can continue up.\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom t=46, y=0.\n\nt=47: y=1\n\nt=48: y=2\n\nt=49: y=3\n\nt=50: y=4\n\nt=51: y=5 (by taking U at t=50)\n\nAt t=51, I take S (stay), so y=5 at t=52.\n\nThen at t=52, take U, y=6 at t=53.\n\nt=53: y=6\n\nThen U, t=54: y=7\n\nU, t=55: y=8\n\nU, t=56: y=9\n\nSo at t=56, y=9.\n\nNow, H is the number of turns from t=44 to when I reach y=9.\n\nI reach y=9 at t=56.\n\nBut t=56 is turn when I am at y=9, so after actions from t=44 to t=55? Let's see.\n\nStart at t=44, y=2.\n\nI took actions to go down first.\n\nIn this path, I went down to y=0 at t=46.\n\nHow?\n\nAt t=44, y=2, take D, so y_{45} =1\n\nAt t=45, y=1, take D, so y_{46} =0\n\nThen t=46, y=0, take U, y_{47}=1\n\nU, t=48: y=2? t=47: y=1, take U, y_{48}=2\n\nSequence:\n\nt=44: action a_{44} = D, so y_{45} = 2 + (-1) =1\n\nAt t=45, on y=1, action a_{45} = D, so y_{46} =1 + (-1) =0\n\nAt t=46, on y=0, action a_{46} = U, so y_{47} =0 +1 =1\n\nAt t=47, on y=1, action a_{47} = U, y_{48} =1+1=2\n\nAt t=48, on y=2, action U, y_{49}=3\n\nAt t=49, on y=3, action U, y_{50}=4\n\nAt t=50, on y=4, action U, y_{51}=5\n\nAt t=51, on y=5, action S (stay), so y_{52} =5 +0 =5\n\nAt t=52, on y=5, action U, y_{53} =5+1=6\n\nAt t=53, on y=6, action U, y_{54}=7\n\nAt t=54, on y=7, action U, y_{55}=8\n\nAt t=55, on y=8, action U, y_{56}=9\n\nNow, at t=56, y=9, so I reached at turn t=56.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=44 to t=55? The sequence of actions is from t=44 to t=55, that's 12 actions? Let's count the turns.\n\nThe actions are taken at turns t=44 to t=55, for H=12 turns, and at t=56 I am at y=9.\n\nBut H is the number of actions to reach, I think.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", so after H actions, I should be at (0,9).\n\nStart at t1=44, position (0,y_{t1}) = (0,2)\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position should be (0,9)\n\nIn this case, after actions from t=44 to t=55, that's 12 actions (t=44,45,...,55), at turn t=56, y=9.\n\nSo H=12, sequence of 12 actions.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nI went down to y=0, which took extra moves.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid going down and go up earlier.\n\nSince at t=46, I need to be off y=1-5.\n\nI could go up quickly to y=6 or above before t=46.\n\nBut I start at y=2 at t=44.\n\nt=44: y=2\n\nIf I take U, t=45: y=3\n\nThen at t=45, on y=3.\n\nNow, from y=3 at t=45, I need to go to y=6 or higher by t=46.\n\nBut in one move, from t=45 to t=46, I can only change y by at most 1.\n\nSo at t=46, y_{46} can be at most y_{45} +1.\n\nSince y_{45} <=4 if I go up, but y_{45} is 3, so y_{46} <=4, which is less than 6, so I cannot reach y=6 by t=46.\n\ny=6 requires at least 4 moves from y=2: to y=3,4,5,6.\n\nFrom t=44 to t=46, only two moves: t=44 and t=45 actions.\n\nFrom y=2, after two U, y=4 at t=46.\n\nBut y=4 is in 1-5, collision.\n\nIf I go U and then U, y=4 at t=46.\n\nOr U and S, y=3 at t=46.\n\nAll below 6.\n\nCannot reach y=6 by t=46.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is possible, as I did.\n\nOr I could stay on y=0 or y=9, but y=9 not possible yet.\n\nAnother way: at t=46, be on y=0.\n\nBut y=0 is safe.\n\nIn the path above, I used 12 turns to reach y=9 at t=56.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach earlier by not going down or by timing differently.\n\nSince the only critical points are t=46 and t=51,52, I might pass through the freeways at safe times.\n\nFor example, from y=2 at t=44, I could stay for some turns or move to avoid.\n\nBut at t=46, I must not be on y=1-5.\n\nSo if I am on y=2 at t=44, the only way to not be on 1-5 at t=46 is to be on y=0 at t=46, as I did.\n\nIf I go down to y=1 at t=45, then to y=0 at t=46.\n\nCould I go up? But I cannot reach y=6 in time.\n\nPerhaps go to y=5 or something and wait, but at t=46, I cannot be on y=5.\n\nAnother idea: since y=0 is safe, and I need to go up later, but I have to deal with t=51,52.\n\nIn the previous path, I reached y=5 at t=51, then waited at t=51 (action S) to avoid being on y=6 at t=52, then went up at t=52 to y=6 at t=53.\n\nBut at t=51 and t=52, y=6-8 are occupied, but at t=53, they are safe.\n\nNow, can I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, start going up immediately but delay or advance to miss the collisions.\n\nBut at t=46, I must be off y=1-5.\n\nSo I have to spend at least one turn below or something.\n\nMinimal time: suppose I go down to y=0 at t=46, as before.\n\nThen from y=0 at t=46 to y=9.\n\nIf no obstacles, min 9 turns, to y=9 at t=55.\n\nBut because of t=51,52, I had to wait at y=5 for one turn, so I arrived at y=9 at t=56.\n\nCan I avoid that?\n\nFor example, from t=46 y=0, if I go up faster? But I can only move one per turn.\n\nt=46: y=0\n\nt=47: y=1\n\nt=48: y=2\n\nt=49: y=3\n\nt=50: y=4\n\nNow at t=50, y=4.\n\nI can go to y=5 at t=51.\n\nBut at t=51, y=5 is safe.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=6.\n\nBut if I go to y=6 at t=52, collision.\n\nSo I must not be on y=6 at t=52.\n\nTherefore, I need to either be on y=6 before t=51 or after t=52.\n\nBut before t=51: at t=50, I am on y=4, if I go U to y=5 at t=51, cannot go to y=6 before t=51.\n\nt=51 is the turn, so at t=50, I can only reach y=5 at t=51.\n\nThen to reach y=6 at t=52, but t=52 is occupied.\n\nTo reach y=6 at or before t=50, but from t=46, let's see.\n\nt=46: y=0\n\nt=47: y=1\n\nt=48: y=2\n\nt=49: y=3\n\nt=50: y=4\n\nAt t=50, y=4, cannot be on y=6.\n\nTo be on y=6 at t=50, I need to have been on y=5 at t=49, etc.\n\nt=46: y=0\n\nIf I go U, t=47: y=1\n\nU, t=48: y=2\n\nU, t=49: y=3\n\nU, t=50: y=4\n\nCannot reach y=6 by t=50.\n\nEarliest to reach y=6 is t=52? From y=0 at t=46:\n\nAfter 6 U: t=46:0, U t=47:1, U t=48:2, U t=49:3, U t=50:4, U t=51:5, U t=52:6\n\nBut at t=52, y=6, occupied.\n\nIf I go faster, impossible.\n\nSo I must reach y=6 after t=52, i.e., at t=53 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=7,8.\n\nIn the path, I reached y=6 at t=53.\n\nThen y=7 at t=54, y=8 at t=55, y=9 at t=56.\n\nAt t=51, I was on y=5, which is fine, and I stayed there at t=52.\n\nCould I be on a higher y at t=51?\n\nFor example, if I start from t=46 y=0, and go up, but I cannot reach y=6 before t=52 without being at y=6 at t=51 or t=52, both bad.\n\nt=51 and t=52 are both occupied for y=6,7,8.\n\nSo the safe times to be on y=6,7,8 are before t=51 or after t=52.\n\nBefore t=51: e.g., at t=50, but at t=50, from above, I am at y=4 if I start from t=46.\n\nt=46:0, t=47:1, t=48:2, t=49:3, t=50:4, cannot be on y=6 at t=50.\n\nAfter t=52: e.g., t=53 or later.\n\nSo I must be on y=6 at t=53 or later, similarly for 7 and 8.\n\nThus, the earliest I can be on y=6 is t=53.\n\nThen y=7 at t=54, y=8 at t=55, y=9 at t=56.\n\nAnd at t=51 and t=52, I need to be on y<=5.\n\nIn the path, I was on y=5 at t=51 and t=52.\n\nI could be on lower y, but that might not help.\n\nNow, back to the beginning, I went down to y=0 to avoid t=46.\n\nBut is there a way to not go down and still avoid t=46?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=6 at t=46, but impossible from y=2 in two moves.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=0 earlier or something.\n\nAt t=44, y=2, I could stay or move, but I have to be off y=1-5 at t=46.\n\nSo only y=0 or y=6+, but y=6+ impossible.\n\nSo must be on y=0 at t=46.\n\nThus, going down is necessary.\n\nPerhaps I can go down and come up faster, but I think 12 turns is minimal in this case.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=51 and t=52, I need to avoid y=6-8, and I can be on y=5 or below.\n\nIn the up path, I was on y=5 at t=51 and t=52.\n\nBut I could be on y=4 or lower, but that would take more time to go up later, so worse.\n\nFor example, if at t=50, instead of going to y=5, I stay at y=4 or something, then I reach later.\n\nSo being at y=5 at t=51 is best.\n\nThen staying at t=51 to avoid moving to y=6 at t=52.\n\nThus, the path I have seems optimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nStart t=44: position y=2, need to go down, so action D.\n\nThen t=45: y=1, action D.\n\nt=46: y=0, action U.\n\nt=47: y=1, action U.\n\nt=48: y=2, action U.\n\nt=49: y=3, action U.\n\nt=50: y=4, action U.\n\nt=51: y=5, action S (stay)\n\nt=52: y=5, action U.\n\nt=53: y=6, action U.\n\nt=54: y=7, action U.\n\nt=55: y=8, action U.\n\nThen at t=56: y=9.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions from t=44 to t=55: that's 12 actions.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, so sequence has H actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions from t=44 to t=55.\n\nBut t=55 action U to reach y=9 at t=56.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t_{t1 + H -1}, let's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9)\" means that at turn t1 + H, position is (0,9), I think.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so after a_{t1 + H-1}, at turn (t1 + H-1) +1 = t1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn this case, t1=44, after a_{44} to a_{55}, which is t=0 to t=11? Let's index.\n\nt1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0: a_{t1 +0} = a_{44}\n\nt=1: a_{45}\n\n...\n\nt=H-1: a_{t1 + H-1}\n\nThen after this action, at turn (t1 + H-1) +1 = t1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nIn my case, I have actions up to a_{55}, and at t=56, position (0,9).\n\nt1 + H = 44 + H = 56, so H=12.\n\nSequence: a_{44} to a_{55}.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=44 to t=55, 12 actions.\n\nNow, but in the answer format, it should list the actions.\n\nBut is H minimal?\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier by not going all the way down.\n\nAnother thought: at t=46, I need to be on y=0, but I could be on y=0 at t=46 with fewer moves.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=44, to y=0 at t=46.\n\nWith two down moves: D at t=44 to y=1 at t=45, D at t=45 to y=0 at t=46.\n\nThat's the only way, since one move to y=1 at t=45, then to y=0 at t=46.\n\nIf I go down slower, it takes more moves.\n\nSo minimal moves to reach y=0 at t=46.\n\nThen from there, to y=9, minimal 9 moves, but with the wait at t=51, it took 10 moves from t=46 to t=55 for actions, but positions: from t=46 to t=56, 10 turns? Let's see.\n\nFrom t=46 y=0 to t=56 y=9, that's 10 turns, but with 10 actions? Actions from t=46 to t=55, 10 actions, to reach at t=56.\n\nt=46 to t=55 is 10 actions? t=46,47,...,55: that's 10 turns (46 to 55 inclusive is 10? 55-46+1=10, yes.\n\nBut from y=0 to y=9, normally 9 actions, but here I have an extra S action at t=51, so 10 actions from t=46 to t=55.\n\nIn the sequence: actions at t=46 to t=55: U,U,U,U,U,S,U,U,U,U? Let's list:\n\nt=46: U to y=1 at t=47? No.\n\nAt turn t, action determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt t=46: on y=0, action U, so y_{47}=1\n\nt=47: on y=1, action U, y_{48}=2\n\n...\n\nUp to t=50: on y=4, action U, y_{51}=5\n\nt=51: on y=5, action S, so y_{52}=5\n\nt=52: on y=5, action U, y_{53}=6\n\nt=53: U, y_{54}=7\n\nt=54: U, y_{55}=8\n\nt=55: U, y_{56}=9\n\nSo actions from t=46 to t=55: 10 actions.\n\nBut in the full sequence, from t=44 to t=55: 12 actions.\n\nNow, without the S, I could reach in 9 actions from t=46, but I cannot because of the collision at t=52.\n\nThus H=12 seems necessary.\n\nBut let's see if I can start going up later or something.\n\nSuppose at t=44, I stay or move up, but I have to go down anyway.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I can be on y=9 at t=46, but impossible.\n\nOr on y=6 at t=46, impossible.\n\nSo I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nBut let's check the car on freeway 8 or others.\n\nIn freeway 8, there is a car at (24,13,right,6), but we saw it never at 0, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nPerhaps at some turns, other freeways have cars, but we listed only at t=46 for 1-5 and t=51,52 for 6-8.\n\nFor example, freeway 6: occupied at t=51,52.\n\nAt other times, no.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the path, at t=53, y=6, freeway 6, at t=53, dt=53-44=9, span for freeway 6 car: [-53 +6*9, -42 +6*9] = [-53+54, -42+54] = [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, but in the beginning, I have to go down.\n\nBut let's write the action sequence for the full path.\n\nStart t=44: action D (to go down to y=1)\n\nt=45: action D (to y=0)\n\nt=46: action U (to y=1)\n\nt=47: action U (to y=2)\n\nt=48: action U (to y=3)\n\nt=49: action U (to y=4)\n\nt=50: action U (to y=5)\n\nt=51: action S (stay at y=5)\n\nt=52: action U (to y=6)\n\nt=53: action U (to y=7)\n\nt=54: action U (to y=8)\n\nt=55: action U (to y=9)\n\nThen at t=56, y=9.\n\nThe actions are from t=44 to t=55.\n\nIn the sequence, for t=44 to t=55.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn 44: D\n\nTurn 45: D\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: S\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nH=12.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose I don't go all the way to y=0.\n\nFor example, at t=44, y=2, I take S, so at t=45, y=2.\n\nBut at t=45, I need to take action for t=46.\n\nIf I take D, to y=1 at t=46, but y=1 at t=46 collision.\n\nIf I take U, to y=3 at t=46 collision.\n\nS, y=2 collision.\n\nNo.\n\nAt t=44, take U to y=3 at t=45.\n\nThen at t=45, on y=3, I must not be on y=3 at t=46, so I have to move, but if I move U to y=4 at t=46 collision, D to y=2 collision, S same.\n\nNo way.\n\nSo must go down to y=0 at t=46.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=0 earlier, but that might not help.\n\nAt t=44, take D to y=1 at t=45.\n\nThen at t=45, on y=1, I can take S, but then at t=46 y=1 collision.\n\nOr take D to y=0 at t=46, same as before.\n\nOr take U, to y=2 at t=46 collision.\n\nSo no other choices.\n\nThus, the path is necessary.\n\nNow, for the later part, I waited at y=5 for one turn.\n\nCould I be on a different y at t=51?\n\nFor example, if from t=46, I go slower.\n\nSuppose at t=46, y=0, I take S, stay at y=0 for one turn, but that would delay me.\n\nThen t=46: S, y=0 at t=47? At t=46 action S, y_{47}=0.\n\nThen I am still at y=0 at t=47.\n\nThen start going up later, so I reach later, worse.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up but stop earlier, say at y=4 at t=51, but then I need to go to y=5,6,etc, still need to pass through, and at t=51, if on y=4, safe, but then at t=51, I can go to y=5 at t=52, which is safe, then at t=52 on y=5, go to y=6 at t=53, etc.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nFrom t=46 y=0:\n\nOption: t=46: U, y_{47}=1\n\nt=47: U, y_{48}=2\n\nt=48: U, y_{49}=3\n\nt=49: U, y_{50}=4\n\nNow at t=50, on y=4.\n\nAction: if U, y_{51}=5\n\nThen at t=51, on y=5, safe.\n\nThen at t=51, I can take U, but if U, y_{52}=6, but at t=52, y=6 occupied, collision.\n\nIf take S, y_{52}=5\n\nThen at t=52, on y=5, take U, y_{53}=6\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt t=50, instead of U, I take S, so y_{51}=4\n\nThen at t=51, on y=4, safe.\n\nThen take U, y_{52}=5\n\nAt t=52, on y=5, safe.\n\nThen take U, y_{53}=6\n\nThen continue to y=9 at t=57? Let's see.\n\nt=52: y=5, U to y=6 at t=53\n\nt=53: y=6, U to y=7 at t=54\n\nt=54: y=7, U to y=8 at t=55\n\nt=55: y=8, U to y=9 at t=56\n\nSame as before? At t=56 y=9.\n\nBut in this case, from t=50: at t=50 on y=4, I took S to stay at y=4 for t=51? No.\n\nt=50: on y=4, action S, so y_{51}=4\n\nThen at t=51, on y=4, action U, y_{52}=5\n\nAt t=52, on y=5, action U, y_{53}=6\n\nThen y=7 at t=54, y=8 at t=55, y=9 at t=56.\n\nBut compared to previous: in previous, I was at y=5 at t=51 and t=52, then to y=6 at t=53.\n\nHere, at t=51 I am at y=4, t=52 at y=5, then y=6 at t=53, same timing for y=6 and above.\n\nBut I reached y=5 later? In first path, at t=51 I was at y=5, here at t=51 I am at y=4, so I am one step behind.\n\nThen to reach y=9 at same t=56, but in this case, at t=55 I go to y=8, t=56 to y=9? t=55 action U to y=9 at t=56.\n\nBut in this sequence: from t=46 to t=55 actions.\n\nt=46: U to y=1 t=47\n\n...\n\nt=49: U to y=4 t=50? t=46: U, y47=1\n\nt47: U, y48=2\n\nt48: U, y49=3\n\nt49: U, y50=4\n\nt50: S, y51=4  (stayed at y=4)\n\nt51: U, y52=5\n\nt52: U, y53=6\n\nt53: U, y54=7\n\nt54: U, y55=8\n\nt55: U, y56=9\n\nSo reached at t=56 same, but I used an extra S at t=50, so one more action, worse.\n\nIn first path, no extra stay until t=51.\n\nIn first path: t=50: U to y=5 t=51\n\nThen t=51: S to y=5 t=52\n\nThen t=52: U to y=6 t=53\n\netc.\n\nHere I have t=50: S, which is unnecessary delay.\n\nSo first path better.\n\nThus, minimal H is 12.\n\nNow, but in the action sequence, for t=51, I have S.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut let's write it clearly.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 44: D\n\nTurn 45: D\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: S\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nAnd H=12.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and sequence.\n\nNow, but I think I missed something.\n\nIn freeway 8, there is a car at (24,13,right,6), but we saw it doesn't affect.\n\nAlso, at t=53, when I am on y=6, freeway 6, at t=53, as computed, span [1,12], not at 0.\n\nSimilarly, t=54 y=7, freeway 7 car: at t=54, dt=54-44=10, span for freeway 7 car: [-53 +6*10, -42 +6*10] = [-53+60, -42+60] = [7,18], not 0.\n\nt=55 y=8, freeway 8: first car [-53+6*11, -42+6*11]? t=55, dt=55-44=11, span [-53+66, -42+66] = [13,24], not 0.\n\nSecond car on freeway 8: (24,13,right,6), at t=44 span [13,24], at t=55 dt=11, [13+66,24+66]= [79,90], not 0.\n\nAll safe.\n\nIn the beginning, when I went down, at t=45 y=1, freeway 1: at t=45, dt=1, span [48-36,83-36]=[12,47], not 0, safe.\n\nt=46 y=0, no freeway.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps I can reach with H=11? But how.\n\nFor example, if I don't wait at t=51, but I have to.\n\nSuppose I go up faster after t=46, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=51 and t=52, I need to avoid y=6-8, but if I can be on y=9 before t=51, but from t=46 y=0, to y=9 in 9 moves, at t=55, but t=55 is after t=52, but at t=51 and t=52 I might be on y=6-8.\n\nFor example, if I go straight up:\n\nt=46: U, y47=1\n\nt=47: U, y48=2\n\nt=48: U, y49=3\n\nt=49: U, y50=4\n\nt=50: U, y51=5\n\nt=51: U, y52=6 → but at t=52, on y=6, occupied, collision.\n\nIf I go to y=6 at t=51, but at t=51, on y=6 occupied.\n\nt=51 action U to y=6 at t=52, but at t=52 position y=6.\n\nBut at t=51, I am on y=5.\n\nTo be on y=6 at t=50, impossible from t=46.\n\nSo cannot avoid the delay.\n\nThus H=12 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence should be as above.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut let's write the actions per turn.\n\nAlso, for the S at t=51, it is necessary.\n\nPerhaps I can go down less, but no.\n\nAnother thought: at t=46, I am on y=0, but I could have been on y=0 earlier and started up earlier, but since I start at y=2, going down takes the same time.\n\nFor example, if at t=44, I go D to y=1 at t=45, then at t=45 go D to y=0 at t=46, same as before.\n\nIf I go directly, but cannot.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nThus, minimal H=12, with the sequence.\n\nNow, for the box.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 44\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 12. The sequence of actions ensures that the player is not on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 46 (when these freeways are occupied) and not on freeways \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at turns 51 and 52 (when these freeways are occupied). The actions are designed to move down to \\(y = 0\\) by turn 46 to avoid the collision at turn 46, then move up efficiently while waiting at \\(y = 5\\) during turn 51 to avoid being on \\(y = 6\\) at turn 52.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- At turn 44, move down (D) to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 45.\n- At turn 45, move down (D) to \\(y = 0\\) at turn 46.\n- At turn 46, move up (U) to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 47.\n- At turn 47, move up (U) to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 48.\n- At turn 48, move up (U) to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 49.\n- At turn 49, move up (U) to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 50.\n- At turn 50, move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 51.\n- At turn 51, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 5\\) at turn 52 (avoiding collision on \\(y = 6\\) at turn 52).\n- At turn 52, move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 53.\n- At turn 53, move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 54.\n- At turn 54, move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 55.\n- At turn 55, move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 56.\n\nAfter 12 actions (from turn 44 to turn 55), the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 56.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 44: \\, \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 45: \\, \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 46: \\, \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 47: \\, \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 48: \\, \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: \\, \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 50: \\, \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 51: \\, \\text{S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 52: \\, \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 53: \\, \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 54: \\, \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 55: \\, \\text{U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 46, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe grid has freeways at y=1 to 8. Each freeway has cars that move either left or right at constant speed.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (where y is between 1 and 8) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has its span including 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nNote: The player's movement:\n  - At each turn, the player chooses an action: U (up: y increases by 1), D (down: y decreases by 1), or S (stay: y remains).\n  - The player's y must be in [0,9]. So at y=0, cannot go down; at y=9, cannot go up.\n\nWe start at (0,0) at turn 46. We must end at (0,9) at some turn T.\n\nThe key is to simulate the movement of the player and check for collisions at each step. We also need to simulate the movement of the cars.\n\nCar movement:\n  For a car at freeway i (which is fixed for that car) with initial head h, tail tau, direction d, and speed s at turn t1 (46), then at turn T (>=46):\n    - If left-moving: the span becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n    - If right-moving: the span becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]? \n      But note the description: for right-moving, initially the car is given as (head, tail) but in the table it's written as (h, tau) and then the update for right is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. However, in the table for right-moving cars, the head is the larger number? Actually, let's see the example:\n\n      In the table, for freeway 3,4,5: \n          (48,37,right,12) -> head=48, tail=37? But then for a right-moving car, the head should be the front? \n      The update rule for right-moving: \n          Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n      This suggests that in the initial state (at t1=46), the car is from tau to h? But note: for the right-moving car, the car moves to the right, so the entire car shifts right by s*(T-t1). The initial span is [tau, h] (meaning the car extends from tau to h, and tau < h). Then at time T, it becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\n      Similarly, for left-moving, the initial span is [h, tau] but note that for left-moving, the car moves left, so the initial head is at h and tail at tau (with h>tau). Then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut wait: in the table, the cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For left-moving: \n    freeway 1: (48,83,left,36) -> but 48 to 83? That would be from 48 to 83, which is increasing, but left-moving? This seems inconsistent.\n\nLet me re-read the update:\n\nFor left-moving: \n    initial span: [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\nBut if the car is moving left, then the head (front) should be the leftmost? Actually, the problem says \"head\" and \"tail\". \n\nLooking at the update: \n    Left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, tau] -> [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]\n    Right-moving: Span(t1)=[tau, h] -> [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]\n\nSo for left-moving, the car is from h to tau, and h should be the leftmost? But then if the car is moving left, then the entire car shifts left. Similarly, for right-moving, the car is from tau to h (so tau < h) and moves right.\n\nBut in freeway 1: (48,83,left,36): \n    This would mean the car is from 48 to 83? That's 48 to 83 (which is rightward) but the car is moving left? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, the problem says for left-moving: the initial span is [h, tau] and then becomes [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. So if h=48 and tau=83, then the initial car is from 48 to 83? But then when it moves left, the entire segment shifts left. However, the car is moving left so the head (which is the front) should be at the left? But here the initial head is 48 and tail is 83, meaning the car is from 48 to 83 (so the front is at 48? and the tail at 83? but then when moving left, the front goes to 48-... and the tail to 83-...). \n\nThis is confusing. Alternatively, the problem might have a typo? \n\nLooking at freeway 3: \n    (48,37,right,12): for a right-moving car, the initial span is [tau, h] = [37,48]? So the car is from 37 to 48? Then at T, it becomes [37 + s*(T-46), 48+s*(T-46)].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 1: (48,83,left,36): the initial span is [h, tau] = [48,83]? Then the car is from 48 to 83? But then moving left, it becomes [48-36*(T-46), 83-36*(T-46)].\n\nBut note: the problem says that the car update rules are defined so that the entire car moves without changing length. \n\nHowever, the issue: for freeway 1, the car is 83-48+1 = 36 units long? And for freeway 3, the car (48,37) is 48-37+1=12 units? \n\nBut wait, the problem also lists multiple cars per freeway. For example, freeway 3 has three cars: \n    (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nSo we have to consider each car independently.\n\nNow, the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and at that turn, there is at least one car on that freeway such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nNote: the player is at x=0 always, so we care only about whether 0 is in the car's span.\n\nAlso note: the player is on a freeway at turn T if y_T is between 1 and 8. At the turn when the player moves from y to y+1 (or y-1), at that turn T the player is still on the old row. The problem states: \n  \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nSo at turn T, the player is on the row y_T. Only when the next turn comes, the player moves to the new row.\n\nTherefore, we must simulate:\n\n  - At turn T (starting at T=46), the player is at a row y. \n      If y is 0 or 9, then no collision check (since no freeway at 0 or 9).\n      If y is in [1,8], then we check all cars on freeway y at turn T: for each car, compute its span at T and see if 0 is in that span.\n\nWe start at T=46, y=0 (safe).\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nWe are allowed to move up, down, or stay. But we want minimal turns.\n\nThe minimal vertical distance: from 0 to 9, we need at least 9 moves (if we move up 9 times). But we might have to wait (stay) to avoid cars.\n\nSo H is at least 9.\n\nWe have to simulate the car positions at each future turn.\n\nLet dt = T - 46.\n\nFor each freeway, we have a set of cars. For each car, we can compute its span at time T.\n\nWe are going to try to find the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nWe can do a BFS or Dijkstra? The state can be (turn, y). The turn starts at 46 and we want to minimize the number of turns. The cost is the number of steps (turns) to get to (turn, 9). \n\nBut note: the turn index matters because the cars move over time.\n\nThe state: (time, y) where time is the current turn (starting at 46, then 47, 48, ...) and y in [0,9]. \n\nWe start at (46,0). We want to reach (T,9) for some T.\n\nThe actions: U, D, S.\n\nConstraints: \n  - If y==0, cannot do D.\n  - If y==9, cannot do U.\n\nAt each state (t, y), we check if y is in [1,8], then we check the freeway y at time t: for each car on freeway y, compute the span at time t and check if 0 is in the span. If yes, then this state is invalid (collision). \n\nNote: at the starting state (46,0): y=0 -> safe.\n\nWe then simulate the next state by applying an action.\n\nWe want the minimal H such that we reach (t,9) for the first time. Since we are counting the turns from t1=46, then the number of turns H is (t - 46 + 1) because we start at t1 and then we do H actions: at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nBut note: the problem says: \"sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning the actions taken at turns: t1 (t=0) to t1+H-1 (t=H-1). And at the end of these H actions, we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo the state we are looking for is (t1+H-1, 9).\n\nWe can do BFS in the state space (time, y). However, the time can go to infinity? But we know that we can only stay for so long. Actually, the minimal H is at least 9 and we can bound the waiting time.\n\nBut note: the cars are moving at constant speed. The car positions are linear in time. The collision condition is periodic? Not exactly, because the cars have different speeds and initial positions. However, we can compute the exact time when a car covers 0.\n\nBut the problem: multiple cars per freeway and multiple freeways. We might have to wait until a car passes.\n\nWe can try to compute the safe times for each freeway? But since we are moving through freeways sequentially, we can plan the crossing of each freeway at a safe time.\n\nHowever, we are allowed to go up and down arbitrarily, so we can wait at y=0 or y=9 (if we get there) or at any safe row.\n\nBut note: we start at y=0 and must get to y=9. The minimal path would be to go up 9 times. But we have to avoid collisions at rows 1 to 8.\n\nWe can simulate step by step.\n\nLet me compute the car positions at a given time T (relative to t1=46, so dt = T-46).\n\nWe'll define a function that for a given freeway k and time T (>=46) returns whether the freeway k is safe at time T (i.e., no car on freeway k has a span that includes 0 at time T).\n\nFreeway 1: \n  Cars: (48,83,left,36)\n  At T: \n      car1: [48 - 36*(T-46), 83 - 36*(T-46)]\n  We need 0 in [48-36*(T-46), 83-36*(T-46)]?\n      Solve: 48 - 36*(T-46) <= 0 <= 83 - 36*(T-46)\n\n      First inequality: 48 - 36*(T-46) <= 0  => 36*(T-46) >= 48 => T-46 >= 48/36 = 4/3 => T>=46+4/3 -> T>=47.333 -> so T>=48\n      Second inequality: 0 <= 83 - 36*(T-46) => 36*(T-46) <= 83 => T-46 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 => T<=46+2.305 = 48.305 -> T<=48 (since T integer) -> T<=48.\n\n      Therefore, only at T=48: \n          Check: at T=48: [48-36*2, 83-36*2] = [48-72, 83-72] = [-24,11] -> 0 is in [-24,11] -> unsafe at T=48.\n\n      At T=47: [48-36*1, 83-36*1] = [12,47] -> 0 not in [12,47] -> safe.\n      At T=49: [48-36*3, 83-36*3] = [48-108, 83-108] = [-60,-25] -> 0 not in [-60,-25] -> safe.\n\n      So freeway 1 is unsafe only at T=48.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? \n  Cars: (48,83,left,36) -> same as freeway 1 -> unsafe only at T=48.\n\nFreeway 3: \n  Cars: \n    (48,37,right,12) -> for right-moving: initial span [37,48]? \n        But note: the problem says for right-moving: the initial span is [tau, h] = [37,48]? \n        Then at T: [37 + 12*(T-46), 48+12*(T-46)]\n\n    (12,1,right,12): [1,12] -> becomes [1+12*(T-46), 12+12*(T-46)]\n    (-24,-35,right,12): for this car, initial span [-35,-24]?

But note: at T=46: [-11,0] -> 0 is included? \n          So at T=46: the car covers 0 -> unsafe.\n\n          Now, check for other T:\n          The condition: \n            Left: -11+6*(T-46) <=0 -> 6*(T-46)<=11 -> T-46<=11/6≈1.833 -> T<=47.833 -> so T=46 and T=47.\n\n          At T=47: [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6] -> 0 in [-5,6] -> unsafe.\n          At T=48: [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\n      Therefore, freeway 8 is unsafe at T=46 and T=47, but safe at T=48.\n\nSummary of unsafe times per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=48\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=48\nFreeway 3: unsafe at T=48\nFreeway 4: unsafe at T=48\nFreeway 5: unsafe at T=48\nFreeway 6: safe always\nFreeway 7: safe always\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=46,47; safe at T>=48\n\nNow, we are at T=46, at y=0.\n\nWe need to move up to y=9. The minimal number of steps is 9 (if we go up 9 times). But we must avoid being on a freeway when it is unsafe.\n\nPlan:\n\nWe must cross each freeway (y=1 to y=8) at a time when that freeway is safe.\n\nBut note: we are at T=46 at y=0. We can choose to move up at T=46 (to y=1) or stay or down (but down not allowed at y=0). So we can only do U or S at T=46.\n\nBut if we do U at T=46, then at T=46 we are still at y=0? Then at T=47, we move to y=1.\n\nWait, the update: \n  At turn T, we choose an action. Then the next state (position) is for the next turn.\n\nSo:\n  At T=46: we are at (0,0). We choose an action a_46. Then at T=47, we are at y_47 = y_46 + Delta y.\n\nTherefore, when we are at T=46, we are at y=0. Then we choose an action. Then at T=47, we move to a new y.\n\nSo the freeway we are on at turn T is the y at the beginning of the turn? Actually, the problem says: \n  \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's position at turn T.\n\nTherefore, at T=46, we are at y=0 -> safe. Then we choose an action. Then at T=47, we are at a new y (which is 0+Delta) and then we check for collision at T=47 for that new y.\n\nSo:\n\n  Step 0 (T=46): \n      Position: (0,0) -> safe.\n      We choose an action: either U or S.\n\n  If we choose U: then at T=47, we are at y=1.\n      Then we check freeway 1 at T=47: from above, freeway 1 is safe at T=47? -> yes (only unsafe at T=48). So safe.\n\n  If we choose S: then at T=47, we are at y=0 -> safe.\n\nBut we want to minimize time, so we probably want to move up as much as possible.\n\nNow, we must plan for the next moves.\n\nWe have to avoid:\n\n  - Being on freeway 1 at T=48 -> unsafe\n  - Being on freeway 2 at T=48 -> unsafe\n  - ...\n  - Being on freeway 5 at T=48 -> unsafe\n  - Being on freeway 8 at T=46 and T=47 -> unsafe\n\nBut freeway 6 and 7 are always safe.\n\nWe start at y=0 at T=46.\n\nWe want to get to y=9.\n\nThe direct path: \n  T=46: at y=0 -> choose U -> T=47: y=1 -> safe (freeway1 at T=47 is safe)\n  Then at T=47: choose U -> T=48: y=2 -> but freeway2 at T=48 is unsafe! -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on freeway2 at T=48.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeway 2 at T=48.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be on freeway 1,2,3,4,5 at T=48.\n\nWhat can we do?\n\nOption 1: Wait at y=0 or y=1 until T=49? But note: if we are at y=1 at T=48, then freeway1 is unsafe at T=48 -> collision.\n\nSo we must not be on freeway 1,2,3,4,5 at T=48.\n\nWe can try to be at a freeway that is safe at T=48: freeway 6,7,8 (at T>=48, freeway8 becomes safe). But freeway8 is safe at T=48.\n\nSo if we can be at freeway6,7, or 8 at T=48, then we are safe.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at y=0 or y=9 at T=48 (no freeway) -> safe.\n\nBut we start at y=0 at T=46. We can only move one step per turn.\n\nTo be at freeway6 (y=6) at T=48: \n  We have 2 moves: from T=46 to T=47 and T=47 to T=48.\n\n  We need to go from y=0 to y=6 in 2 moves? Impossible: maximum we can go is 2 steps up -> y=2.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot get to y=6 by T=48.\n\nTo be at y=0 at T=48: we can do S at T=46 and T=47 -> then at T=48 we are at y=0 -> safe. Then we can start moving.\n\nBut we want minimal H.\n\nSo let's try:\n\n  T=46: S -> T=47: y=0 (safe)\n  T=47: S -> T=48: y=0 (safe) [we are at y=0 at T=48, so safe]\n\nThen at T=48: we can start moving up.\n\nBut now we are at T=48, y=0. We need to get to y=9. We can do 9 moves up: then we would be at T=48+9 = T=57 at y=9.\n\nBut is that safe? We have to check the freeways we step on.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid T=48 for freeways 1-5? But we are at T=48 at y=0 -> safe.\n\nThen we move:\n\n  T=48: U -> T=49: y=1 -> freeway1 at T=49: \n        freeway1: at T=49: [48-36*3, 83-36*3] = [48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25] -> safe.\n  T=49: U -> T=50: y=2 -> freeway2 at T=50: same as freeway1 -> [-60,-25] -> safe.\n  T=50: U -> T=51: y=3 -> freeway3 at T=51: \n        cars on freeway3: \n          (48,37,right,12): [37+12*5, 48+12*5] = [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe (0 not in)\n          (12,1,right,12): [1+12*5,12+12*5]=[61,72] -> safe\n          (-24,-35,right,12): [-35+12*5, -24+12*5] = [25,36] -> safe\n        So safe.\n  Similarly, freeway4 and 5: same as freeway3 -> safe.\n\n  Freeway6,7: always safe.\n\n  Freeway8: at T=51: \n        (48,37,right,6): [37+6*5,48+6*5]=[67,78] -> safe\n        (0,-11,right,6): [-11+6*5,0+6*5]=[19,30] -> safe\n\n  So we can go straight up from T=48 to T=57: \n        T=48: y0=0 -> U -> T=49: y=1\n        T=49: U -> T=50: y=2\n        T=50: U -> T=51: y=3\n        T=51: U -> T=52: y=4\n        T=52: U -> T=53: y=5\n        T=53: U -> T=54: y=6\n        T=54: U -> T=55: y=7\n        T=55: U -> T=56: y=8\n        T=56: U -> T=57: y=9\n\n  Total turns: from T=46 to T=57: 57-46+1? Wait, we are counting the actions.\n\n  We did:\n      T=46: S\n      T=47: S\n      T=48: U\n      T=49: U\n      T=50: U\n      T=51: U\n      T=52: U\n      T=53: U\n      T=54: U\n      T=55: U\n      T=56: U\n\n  That's 11 actions? H=11.\n\nBut is that minimal? We waited two turns. But we could have moved earlier on some rows.\n\nAlternatively, we might not wait that long. We could get to a safe row by T=48.\n\nBut we cannot get to freeway6,7,8 by T=48 because we can only move two steps by then.\n\nBut note: we can go up to y=1 at T=47 and then at T=47 we can choose to stay? Then at T=48 we would be at y=1 -> but freeway1 at T=48 is unsafe -> collision.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeway1 at T=48.\n\nWe could go up to y=1 at T=47 and then at T=47 we go down? Then at T=48 we would be at y=0 -> safe.\n\nBut then we are back at y=0 at T=48. Then we have to start over. That would take even more moves.\n\nSo the plan above (wait two turns at y=0) is one possibility.\n\nBut we might be able to go faster by using the safe freeways (6,7,8) earlier.\n\nAnother idea: go up as fast as possible to a safe freeway (say y=6) and wait there until T=48 has passed? \n\nBut to get to y=6, we need at least 6 moves. \n\nAt T=46: y0=0 -> U (T=47: y=1) -> safe (freeway1 at T=47 safe)\nT=47: U (T=48: y=2) -> but freeway2 at T=48 unsafe -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=2 at T=48.\n\nBut what if we wait at y=1? \n  At T=47: we are at y=1 (safe). Then at T=47 we choose S -> then at T=48 we are at y=1 -> freeway1 at T=48: unsafe -> collision.\n\nOr at T=47 we choose D -> then at T=48 we are at y=0 -> safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=0 at T=48. Then we have to go up again. We are back to the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up to y=5 and then wait? But to get to y=5 by T=48, we need 5 moves in 2 steps? Impossible.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeway1 to 5 at T=48. The only safe rows at T=48 are y=0, y=6,7,8,9? But we cannot get to y=6,7,8,9 by T=48.\n\nTherefore, the only safe row at T=48 is y=0.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at T=48.\n\nHow to get to y=0 at T=48? \n  We start at T=46 at y=0. \n  Then we can:\n      Option A: \n          T=46: S -> T=47: y=0\n          T=47: S -> T=48: y=0\n      Option B:\n          T=46: U -> T=47: y=1\n          T=47: D -> T=48: y=0\n\nBoth options get us to y=0 at T=48 safely.\n\nOption A: 2 stays -> then we start moving at T=48.\nOption B: one up and one down -> then we start at T=48.\n\nWhich is better? They both take 2 moves and we are at the same state at T=48.\n\nBut note: the problem asks for minimal H. We have to get to y=9. The moves from T=48 onward: we need at least 9 moves. So total moves: 2 (for the initial two) + 9 = 11.\n\nSo H=11.\n\nBut with Option B, we did two moves: U then D. Then we do 9 moves up. Total actions: 11.\n\nWe can write the sequence:\n\n  T=46: a46 = U (if we choose option B) \n  T=47: a47 = D\n  Then T=48: U\n  T=49: U\n  ... until T=56: U -> at T=57 we are at y=9.\n\nBut wait: after the last action (at T=56) we are at y=9 at T=57. The last action is at T=56, which is the 11th action? \n\nCounting:\n  t1 = 46: \n      t=0: a_{46} = U -> then at T=47: y=1\n      t=1: a_{47} = D -> then at T=48: y=0\n      t=2: a_{48} = U -> T=49: y=1\n      t=3: a_{49} = U -> T=50: y=2\n      t=4: a_{50} = U -> T=51: y=3\n      t=5: a_{51} = U -> T=52: y=4\n      t=6: a_{52} = U -> T=53: y=5\n      t=7: a_{53} = U -> T=54: y=6\n      t=8: a_{54} = U -> T=55: y=7\n      t=9: a_{55} = U -> T=56: y=8\n      t=10: a_{56} = U -> T=57: y=9\n\nSo H=11 (t from 0 to 10, inclusive).\n\nWe can also do Option A: \n  T=46: S\n  T=47: S\n  Then same as above from T=48: 9 moves -> total 11 moves.\n\nBut is there a faster way? \n\nWe might go up as far as we can without getting into the unsafe freeways at T=48, but we have to be at y=0 at T=48.\n\nAlternatively, we might use a different path: for example, go up to y=8 and then wait? But to get to y=8 by T=48, we need 8 moves in 2 steps? impossible.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nBut note: we could also go down? but we start at y=0, so we cannot go down.\n\nNow, we have two sequences that work: \n\nSequence A (wait at start):\n  T46: S\n  T47: S\n  T48: U\n  T49: U\n  T50: U\n  T51: U\n  T52: U\n  T53: U\n  T54: U\n  T55: U\n  T56: U\n\nSequence B (up then down):\n  T46: U\n  T47: D\n  T48: U\n  T49: U\n  T50: U\n  T51: U\n  T52: U\n  T53: U\n  T54: U\n  T55: U\n  T56: U\n\nBut wait: in sequence B, at T=47 we are at y=1 (freeway1) and at T=47 freeway1 is safe. Then we go down to y=0 at T=48, which is safe. Then we start going up.\n\nBoth are 11 moves.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=10? \n\nWe must be at y=9 at T=46+10-1 = T=55.\n\nWe start at T=46 at y=0. We need to get to y=9 by T=55.\n\nWe have 9 moves to go up? But we must avoid the unsafe times.\n\nBut we must also avoid being on freeway1-5 at T=48 and freeway8 at T=46,47.\n\nWe have to be at y=0 at T=48 (as we established).\n\nAt T=48 we are at y=0.\n\nThen we have from T=48 to T=55: 7 moves? But we need to go from y=0 to y=9: 9 moves. So we need 9 moves after T=48? Then we would finish at T=48+9 = T=57 -> too late.\n\nBut we can start moving earlier? \n\nWe are at T=46: y=0.\n\nWe must avoid T=48 at freeways 1-5, and we must be at y=0 at T=48.\n\nBut from T=46 to T=48, we have two moves. We can do:\n\n  Move1 (T=46): U -> y=1 at T=47\n  Move2 (T=47): we cannot stay at y=1 (because at T=48 we would be at y=1 -> unsafe) and we cannot go up to y=2 (because at T=48 we would be at y=2 -> unsafe). So we must go down: D -> then at T=48 we are at y=0.\n\nThen we have from T=48 to T=55: 7 moves? But we need 9 moves to go from 0 to 9? \n\nAlternatively, we might move faster in the later stages? But we can only move one step per turn.\n\nTherefore, we cannot do 9 moves in 7 turns. \n\nSo H must be at least 11.\n\nBut wait: we have 11 actions: from T=46 to T=56 (11 actions: 0 to 10) and we end at T=56+? \n\nActually, the last action is at T=56 (which is t1+10) and then at T=57 we are at y=9. But the problem says the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, and at the end of the sequence (after the last action) we are at (0,9). So that is correct.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 10 actions? Then the last action is at T=55, and we are at (0,9) at T=56? \n\nWe must be at y=9 at T=56? \n\nBut to get from y=0 to y=9, we need 9 moves. And we have to be at y=0 at T=48. So the moves from T=48 to T=55: 8 moves (T48 to T55: 8 actions). We can do 8 moves: we can go from y=0 to y=8 in 8 moves? Then we need one more to get to y=9. But we don't have that move until T=56.\n\nSo we cannot get to y=9 at T=56? \n\nActually, with 8 moves (from T=48 to T=55: 8 actions) we go from y0=0 to y8=8. Then at T=56 we can do one more U to get to y=9 at T=57. But that would be the 11th action.\n\nAlternatively, we might skip the wait at T=48? \n\nBut we cannot avoid the requirement: we must be at y=0 at T=48. \n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, we have two sequences. Which one to choose? \n\nWe can choose either. But let's check if both are safe.\n\nSequence A:\n  T46: S -> T47: y=0 (safe)\n  T47: S -> T48: y=0 (safe)\n  T48: U -> T49: y=1 -> freeway1 at T=49: safe (as computed: [-60,-25])\n  T49: U -> T50: y=2 -> freeway2 at T=50: safe (same as freeway1)\n  T50: U -> T51: y=3 -> freeway3 at T=51: safe (computed above)\n  ... until T56: U -> T57: y=9 -> done.\n\nSequence B:\n  T46: U -> T47: y=1 -> freeway1 at T=47: safe (as computed: [12,47])\n  T47: D -> T48: y=0 -> safe\n  T48: U -> T49: y=1 -> safe\n  ... same as above.\n\nBoth are safe.\n\nBut the problem does not specify any cost for moving, so both are acceptable.\n\nWe can choose either. Let's pick Sequence A to avoid moving down.\n\nBut note: in Sequence B, we went up and then down, which might be acceptable.\n\nBut to be safe, we can use Sequence A.\n\nNow, write the answer:\n\nWe are at turn t1=46.\n\nThe sequence of 11 actions:\n\nTurn 46: S\nTurn 47: S\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\n\nBut wait: the last action at Turn56: U -> then at Turn57 we are at y=9. \n\nBut the problem says: we must reach (0,9) at the last action? \n\nActually, the sequence is applied: at turn t1 (46) we do the first action, then at t1+1 (47) the next, ... until the last action at t1+H-1 (46+11-1=56). Then at the moment after the last action, we are at (0,9). That is at turn 56+1? \n\nBut the state after the last action: the position is updated at the next turn. So after the last action (at turn56), the next turn is 57, and we are at (0,9). \n\nThe problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" meaning that after applying the entire sequence, we are at (0,9). \n\nSo that is correct.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=11. \n\nIs there a sequence with H=10? We argued not.\n\nBut let me double-check: can we avoid the wait at T=48 by being at a safe freeway? \n\nWe saw that at T=48, freeway6,7,8 are safe. But we cannot get to freeway6 (y=6) by T=48: \n  T46: U -> T47: y=1\n  T47: U -> T48: y=2 -> but freeway2 at T48 is unsafe -> collision.\n\nAlternatively, if we go faster? We cannot.\n\nSo H=11 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, we can output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 46: S\nTurn 47: S\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\n}\n\nBut wait: in the sequence above, at T=55 we are at y=8? Then at T=56: U -> then at T=57 we are at y=9. So the last action is at T=56.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is from t=0 to t=H-1. So H=11, then the last action is at t1+10 = 56.\n\nBut we have 11 lines: from 46 to 56.\n\nAlternatively, we can do Sequence B:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: D\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\n}\n\nBut note: at T=47 we are at y=1 and then we go down. But we are at y=1 at T=47: that is freeway1 at T=47 -> safe. Then we go down to y=0 at T=48 -> safe.\n\nThen same as above.\n\nWhich one is shorter? Both are 11 moves.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". Both have H=11.\n\nSo either is acceptable.\n\nBut the problem does not specify any preference. We can choose.\n\nHowever, note that in Sequence B, we are moving more (up and down) and might be more risky? But in this case, it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, we might consider: can we avoid two waits at the beginning? \n\nWhat if we do:\n\n  T46: U -> T47: y=1 (safe)\n  T47: S -> T48: y=1 -> but freeway1 at T48 is unsafe -> collision.\n\nNot safe.\n\nOr:\n\n  T46: U -> T47: y=1\n  T47: U -> T48: y=2 -> freeway2 at T48 unsafe -> collision.\n\nNot safe.\n\nSo we must either do SS or UD at the first two moves to end at y=0 at T=48.\n\nWe'll choose the SS sequence to avoid unnecessary movement.\n\nTherefore, the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 46: S\nTurn 47: S\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\n}\n\nBut wait: at T=55: we are at y=7? \n\nLet me simulate the entire sequence:\n\n  Start: T46: (0,0)\n  T46: S -> T47: (0,0)\n  T47: S -> T48: (0,0)\n  T48: U -> T49: (0,1) -> freeway1 at T49: safe? yes (as above: [-60,-25])\n  T49: U -> T50: (0,2) -> freeway2 at T50: same as freeway1 -> safe\n  T50: U -> T51: (0,3) -> freeway3: safe (as above)\n  T51: U -> T52: (0,4) -> freeway4: safe (same as freeway3)\n  T52: U -> T53: (0,5) -> freeway5: safe\n  T53: U -> T54: (0,6) -> freeway6: always safe\n  T54: U -> T55: (0,7) -> freeway7: always safe\n  T55: U -> T56: (0,8) -> freeway8: at T56: \n        car1: (48,37,right,6): at T56: [37+6*(56-46), 48+6*10] = [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe\n        car2: (0,-11,right,6): [-11+60, 0+60] = [49,60] -> safe\n  T56: U -> T57: (0,9) -> done.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, we output the sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn 46, while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11. The sequence of actions is designed to avoid the unsafe conditions on the freeways at specific turns, particularly ensuring the player is not on freeways 1 to 5 at turn 48 and avoids freeway 8 at turns 46 and 47. The player waits at y=0 for the first two turns to safely pass turn 48, then moves upward consistently to reach y=9.\n\nThe unsafe conditions per freeway are:\n- Freeways 1 and 2: unsafe at turn 48.\n- Freeways 3, 4, and 5: unsafe at turn 48.\n- Freeway 8: unsafe at turns 46 and 47, safe from turn 48 onward.\n- Freeways 6 and 7: always safe.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 46, staying (S) keeps the player at y=0 (safe, no freeway at y=0).\n- At turn 47, staying (S) keeps the player at y=0 (safe).\n- At turn 48, moving up (U) to y=1; freeway 1 at turn 49 is safe (car span [-60, -25], 0 not in span).\n- Turns 49 to 56: moving up (U) each turn, reaching y=9 at turn 57. All freeways encountered (y=1 to 8) are safe at the respective turns:\n  - y=2 at turn 50: freeway 2 safe (car span [-60, -25]).\n  - y=3 at turn 51: freeway 3 safe (cars: [97, 108], [61, 72], [25, 36]).\n  - y=4 at turn 52: freeway 4 safe (similar to freeway 3).\n  - y=5 at turn 53: freeway 5 safe (similar to freeway 3).\n  - y=6 at turn 54: freeway 6 safe (always safe, car [97, 108]).\n  - y=7 at turn 55: freeway 7 safe (always safe, car [97, 108]).\n  - y=8 at turn 56: freeway 8 safe (cars: [97, 108], [49, 60]).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 57 (after 11 actions) without collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 46: S \\\\\nTurn 47: S \\\\\nTurn 48: U \\\\\nTurn 49: U \\\\\nTurn 50: U \\\\\nTurn 51: U \\\\\nTurn 52: U \\\\\nTurn 53: U \\\\\nTurn 54: U \\\\\nTurn 55: U \\\\\nTurn 56: U\n}",

The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nPlayer can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y unchanged). The player moves at the same time as the cars. Importantly, collision occurs only if at turn T the player is on a freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and the car on that freeway at turn T has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nNote: The player is at (0, y_t) at turn t. When moving from y_t to y_{t+1}, at turn t the player is still on row y_t. So when we are at turn t, we are on row y_t. If we choose to move to a different row at turn t, then at turn t we are still on the old row, and at turn t+1 we are on the new row.\n\nCar update:\n- Left-moving: at turn T, the car's span is [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)] (since t_1 is the starting turn, which is 50)\n- Right-moving: [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nBut note: the given car state is at turn t_1=50.\n\nWe need to avoid being at a freeway k (from 1 to 8) at any turn T when there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nWe are starting at turn 50 at y=0. We need to go to y=9. We can only change y by -1,0,+1 per turn.\n\nWe must plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) for turns 50, 51, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H is the minimal number of turns to get from 0 to 9 without any collisions. The minimal number of moves would be 9 moves (if we do only U), but we might have to wait (S) or even go down (D) to avoid collisions.\n\nWe have to check for each freeway we step on at each turn.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. We start at y=0 at turn 50. We are safe at y=0 because freeways are from 1 to 8.\n\n2. We need to traverse y=1 to y=8 and then finally step to y=9 (which is safe because no freeway at y=9? Actually, the problem says freeways are at y=1..8, so y=9 is safe).\n\n3. We must avoid being on a freeway k at a turn T when a car on that freeway covers x=0 at that turn.\n\n4. We must compute the positions of the cars at each turn T (starting from T=50) for each freeway.\n\nWe note that the car state for each freeway is given at turn 50.\n\nLet me write the car information for each freeway at turn 50:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=48, τ=83, d=left, s=36) -> left-moving so at turn 50: [48, 83]? \nBut note: for left-moving, the head is at h and tail at τ? Actually, the update rule says:\n  Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\nBut wait: if the car is moving left, then at turn 50, the car is from h to τ? And if h=48 and τ=83, then the car is from 48 to 83? That would be a car of length 36 (since 83-48+1=36) and moving left? But then the head is at 48 (the leftmost point) and the tail at 83? That doesn't make sense because as it moves left, the head should be the leading part. Actually, the problem states:\n  For left-moving: [h, τ] -> [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\nSo at T=50, the car is from h=48 to τ=83. Then at T=51, it becomes [48-36, 83-36] = [12, 47]. \n\nBut note: the car is defined by head and tail. The update rule for left-moving: the entire segment moves left by s per turn.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: [τ, h] -> [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]? \nWait, the table says for freeway 3: (48,37,right,12) -> but then it says [τ, h]? \nThe table says: (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nBut in the update rule for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" -> then becomes [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nSo for the car (48,37,right,12) on freeway 3 at turn 50: \n  Head = 48, tail = 37? Then the span is [τ, h] = [37, 48]? \nBut note: the problem says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, the head is the leading part? Then the car would be from 37 to 48? Then at turn 50, the car is at [37,48]. Then at turn 51: [37+12, 48+12] = [49,60].\n\nBut wait: the table for freeway 3 has three cars: \n  (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 has two cars: (48,37,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nWe need to check for each freeway k (from 1 to 8) at each turn T whether any car on freeway k has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nWe are going to simulate the player moving from y=0 to y=9. The player must not be on a freeway k at a turn T when 0 is in one of the car spans on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nNote: We can only change y by at most 1 per turn, so the minimal number of moves is 9 (if we go up 9 times). But we may need to wait or detour.\n\nWe'll try to compute the positions of the cars for a few turns after 50.\n\nFirst, define the time relative to t_1: let t = T - 50. Then at time t (relative to turn 50), the car positions are:\n\nFor left-moving car (on freeway k) with initial head h, tail τ, speed s:\n  Span(t) = [h - s*t, τ - s*t]\n\nFor right-moving car with initial head h, tail τ, speed s:\n  Note: the update rule uses [τ, h] at t_1, so at time t: [τ + s*t, h + s*t]\n\nBut wait: the initial state at t=0 (turn 50) for a right-moving car: \n  The problem says: at turn t_1, the car is given by (head h, tail τ, direction, speed). \n  Then for right-moving, the span at t_1 is [τ, h]? \n\nBut the table gives: (head, tail) = (48,37) for a right-moving car. Then the span at turn 50 is [37,48]? \nBut that would mean the car is from 37 to 48, and the head is at 48 (the rightmost) and tail at 37 (the leftmost). Then as it moves right, the head moves to higher numbers.\n\nSo we can compute for each freeway and each car the interval at time t (relative to turn 50).\n\nWe need to check for each freeway k and for each turn t (starting at t=0) whether the freeway k is occupied at x=0 at that turn.\n\nBut note: the player is at y_t at turn 50+t. We start at t=0: y=0 (safe). Then at t=1, we are at y_1 (which is the position after the first action at turn 50). \n\nWe are going to build a graph where:\n  state = (time, y) \nbut time is relative and we are looking for the minimal time.\n\nAlternatively, we can do a BFS in the state space: (t_rel, y) where t_rel is the number of turns after the start (so at turn 50+t_rel, we are at y). We start at (0,0) and we want to reach (H,9) for the smallest H.\n\nBut note: the car positions change with absolute time (turn number). So for a state (t_rel, y), the absolute turn is 50+t_rel. Then we can compute the car positions at that absolute turn.\n\nWe must avoid states where at absolute turn T = 50+t_rel, if y is between 1 and 8, then we check the freeway y: if any car on freeway y at turn T has 0 in its span.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each absolute turn T (starting from 50) the set of T for which freeway k is safe (i.e., no car on k at T has 0 in its span).\n\nBut note: we don't know how many turns we need. The minimal H is at least 9. Let's assume we consider up to 20 turns (since we might have to wait).\n\nAlternatively, we can compute for each freeway k the time intervals (in absolute turns) when the freeway k is occupied at x=0.\n\nFor a given car on freeway k, the condition for collision at turn T (absolute) is that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nFor left-moving car: \n  0 ∈ [h - s*(T-50), τ - s*(T-50)] \n  => h - s*(T-50) <= 0 <= τ - s*(T-50)\n\nBut note: the interval [A, B] includes 0 if A<=0<=B. However, we must note that for a left-moving car, the head is the left end? Actually, at turn 50, the car is [h, τ] and since it moves left, the entire segment moves left. So the left end is h - s*(T-50) and the right end is τ - s*(T-50). And we require:\n  h - s*(T-50) <= 0 <= τ - s*(T-50)\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving car: the car is [τ + s*(T-50), h + s*(T-50)], so we require:\n  τ + s*(T-50) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-50)\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: [τ, h] at turn 50 becomes [τ + s*(T-50), h + s*(T-50)]. So the left end is τ + s*(T-50) and the right end is h + s*(T-50). Therefore, we require:\n  τ + s*(T-50) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-50)\n\nBut wait: this is an interval [A, B] with A = τ + s*(T-50) and B = h + s*(T-50). Then 0 is in [A, B] if A<=0<=B.\n\nHowever, note that for the right-moving car, the head is the right end? Then the car spans from A to B, so yes.\n\nBut we must be cautious: the intervals are continuous? Actually, the grid is discrete? The problem doesn't specify, but the x-coordinates are integers? The car positions are given as integers. So we assume integers.\n\nNow, we can compute for each car the set of T (absolute) for which the car covers x=0.\n\nThen for a freeway k, if any of its cars covers x=0 at turn T, then freeway k is unsafe at turn T.\n\nWe'll compute for each freeway k (1..8) the set of T where it is unsafe.\n\nBut note: we are starting at T=50, and we are going to simulate for T from 50 to 50+H (H up to 20).\n\nLet's compute for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one left-moving car: (h=48, τ=83, s=36)\n  Condition: 48 - 36*(T-50) <= 0 <= 83 - 36*(T-50)\n  Let u = T-50, then:\n    48 - 36u <= 0  => 48 <= 36u => u >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333 -> so u>=2 (since u is integer) \n    and 0 <= 83 - 36u => 36u <= 83 => u <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 -> so u<=2.\n  Therefore, u=2 -> T=52.\n  So freeway 1 is unsafe at T=52.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: unsafe at T=52.\n\nFreeway 3: three right-moving cars: \n  Car1: (h=48, τ=37, s=12)\n      Condition: 37 + 12u <= 0 <= 48 + 12u\n      But 37+12u <=0 -> 12u<=-37 -> u<=-37/12 (negative) -> never true. \n      Actually, at u=0: 37<=0<=48 -> false. So never?\n      Actually, we require both: 37+12u <=0 and 0<=48+12u. \n      The second inequality: 0<=48+12u -> u>=-4, which is always true for u>=0.\n      The first: 37+12u<=0 -> u<= -37/12 -> u<=-3.08 -> which is impossible for u>=0. \n      So this car never covers 0.\n\n  Car2: (12,1,right,12)\n      Condition: 1+12u <=0 and 0<=12+12u\n      Second: 0<=12+12u -> u>=-1 -> always true for u>=0.\n      First: 1+12u<=0 -> u<=-1/12 -> never for u>=0.\n      So safe.\n\n  Car3: (-24,-35,right,12)\n      Condition: -35+12u <=0 and 0<=-24+12u\n      First: -35+12u<=0 -> 12u<=35 -> u<=35/12≈2.916 -> u<=2\n      Second: 0<=-24+12u -> 12u>=24 -> u>=2\n      So u=2: T=52.\n      Also u=2: -35+24 = -11 <=0, and -24+24=0<=0 -> yes, 0 is included at u=2.\n      So freeway 3 is unsafe at T=52.\n\nTherefore, freeway 3 is unsafe at T=52.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? \n  The table says: same three cars? \n  So unsafe at T=52 (from the third car).\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 3 and 4? \n  So unsafe at T=52.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (48,37,right,6)\n  Condition: 37+6u <=0 and 0<=48+6u\n  Second: 0<=48+6u -> u>=-8 -> always true for u>=0.\n  First: 37+6u<=0 -> u<= -37/6 -> never for u>=0.\n  So freeway 6 is safe for all T.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6: (48,37,right,6) -> safe.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars:\n  Car1: (48,37,right,6) -> same as above: safe (never covers 0).\n  Car2: (0,-11,right,6)\n      Condition: -11+6u <=0 and 0<=0+6u -> 0<=6u -> u>=0 -> always true for u>=0.\n      First: -11+6u<=0 -> 6u<=11 -> u<=11/6≈1.833 -> so u=0,1.\n      At u=0: -11<=0<=0 -> 0 is in the interval? The interval is [-11,0] at u=0? \n        At u=0: the car is [τ, h] = [-11,0]? Then it includes 0? \n        But wait: the update rule: at turn 50: [τ, h] = [-11,0] -> so the car is from -11 to 0. Then 0 is included? \n        However, note: the problem says the car has head h=0 and tail τ=-11? Then the head is at 0? So the car occupies x=0 at turn 50.\n      Therefore, at u=0 (T=50) and u=1 (T=51): \n        u=0: [-11,0] -> 0 is included.\n        u=1: [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6] -> 0 is included? \n        But wait: condition: -11+6*1 = -5 <=0, and 0<=0+6=6 -> yes, 0 is in [-5,6].\n      Actually, at u=2: [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> 0 not included? \n      But condition: \n        -11+12=1 <=0? -> 1<=0 is false -> so not at u=2.\n\n      However, the condition: \n        We require: -11+6u <= 0 <= 0+6u -> which is -11+6u<=0 and 0<=6u -> which gives u>=0 and u<=11/6 -> so u=0 and u=1.\n\n      Therefore, freeway 8 is unsafe at T=50 and T=51.\n\nSummary of unsafe freeways at absolute turns:\n\nTurn 50 (u=0):\n  Freeway 8: unsafe (because of car2)\n\nTurn 51 (u=1):\n  Freeway 8: unsafe\n\nTurn 52 (u=2):\n  Freeway 1: unsafe\n  Freeway 2: unsafe\n  Freeway 3: unsafe\n  Freeway 4: unsafe\n  Freeway 5: unsafe\n\nOther freeways and other turns? \n  Freeway 6 and 7: safe at all turns.\n\nSo we have:\n\nTurn 50: unsafe freeways: 8\nTurn 51: unsafe freeways: 8\nTurn 52: unsafe freeways: 1,2,3,4,5\n\nNow, we plan the player's moves:\n\nWe start at turn 50 (t_rel=0) at y=0 (safe).\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nWe can use BFS:\n\nState: (t, y) where t is the number of turns passed (so absolute turn = 50+t) and y in [0,9].\n\nWe want to minimize t (the total turns) until we reach y=9.\n\nAt each state, we can choose an action: U, D, S.\n\nConstraints:\n- y must be in [0,9] after the move (so if at y=0, we cannot go down; at y=9, we don't need to move further but we are done).\n- At the next state (t+1, y'), we must not be on an unsafe freeway at turn 50+t+1? \n\nWait: note that at turn 50+t, we are at state (t,y). We choose an action that determines y' for the next state (t+1, y').\n\nBut the collision condition: \n  At the current turn (50+t), we are at y. Since we are at (0,y) at turn 50+t, we must check: if y is between 1 and 8, then we check the freeway y at turn 50+t: if it is unsafe at that turn, then we cannot be there.\n\nHowever, note the problem states: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\".\n\nSo when we are at turn 50+t, we are at y = y_{50+t}. Then if y is between 1 and 8, we check the freeway y at turn 50+t: if unsafe, we collide.\n\nTherefore, at state (t,y) (which corresponds to turn 50+t and position y), we must have that if y is in [1,8], then turn 50+t must be safe for freeway y.\n\nBut our unsafe table is by absolute turn and freeway.\n\nSo we can define a function safe(t_abs, y) for y in [1,8]: \n  safe if freeway y is not unsafe at turn t_abs.\n\nNow, our start: at t_rel=0, absolute turn 50, y=0 -> safe (since y=0 is not a freeway).\n\nWe want to expand to next state:\n\nAt state (t, y), we choose an action a in {U, D, S} that leads to:\n  y_next = \n      if a=U: y+1\n      if a=D: y-1\n      if a=S: y\n\n  and then we have state (t+1, y_next) at absolute turn 50+t+1.\n\nBut note: at the state (t, y), we are at turn 50+t. We must check that if y is in [1,8], then freeway y must be safe at turn 50+t.\n\nThen we move to the next state: at turn 50+t+1, we are at y_next. Then we check for that state: if y_next in [1,8], then freeway y_next must be safe at turn 50+t+1.\n\nSo the algorithm:\n\nWe do a BFS (by time) for states (t, y). We start at (0,0) with path [].\n\nWe maintain a visited set: states (t,y) that we have already visited? But note: we might come to the same y at a different time and that might be useful if we can avoid a collision.\n\nWe'll use a queue: each state is (t, y, path) where path is the sequence of actions so far.\n\nWe want to minimize t when we reach y=9.\n\nBut note: when we reach y=9, we are done. And we are at turn 50+t, and since y=9 is not a freeway, we are safe.\n\nWe must avoid states that are unsafe at the current turn.\n\nSteps:\n\nInitialize: \n  queue: [(0,0, [])]   # t_rel=0, y=0, no actions taken yet (but we are about to take the first action for turn 50)\n\nBut note: the actions we take are for turn 50, 51, ... \n\nAt a state (t, y, path), we are at turn 50+t, and we have taken t actions (from turn 50 to turn 50+t-1) and ended at y at turn 50+t.\n\nNow, we are about to choose the next action for turn 50+t, which will lead to y_next at turn 50+t+1.\n\nBut first, we must check the current state (t, y): if y is in [1,8], we must check if freeway y is safe at turn 50+t. If not, then this state is invalid and we skip.\n\nWait: actually, we should have checked the state when we entered it? \n\nHow we built the state (t,y): we got there by an action at the previous turn. Then at the beginning of turn 50+t, we are at (t,y). We must check if (at turn 50+t) we are safe.\n\nSo at the time we pop a state (t,y,path), we check:\n  if y is in [1,8] and if freeway y is unsafe at turn 50+t -> then we skip this state.\n\nOtherwise, we can choose the next action.\n\nThen we consider the next action a in {U, D, S} (if applicable: if y=0, we cannot do D; if y=9, we cannot do U? but we are done at y=9).\n\nBut note: we are not at y=9 in the state we are popping? We are going to check if we can go to y=9.\n\nActually, if we are at (t, y) and we are safe, then we can choose an action. After the action, we move to (t+1, y_next) at turn 50+t+1.\n\nThen we must check the new state (t+1, y_next) for safety at turn 50+t+1? Actually, we check when we pop that state? \n\nBut we can precompute the safety for each freeway at each absolute turn we might encounter (say from 50 to 50+max_t, max_t=20).\n\nNow, we start:\n\nWe have the unsafe table:\n\nTurn 50: unsafe freeways: 8\nTurn 51: unsafe freeways: 8\nTurn 52: unsafe freeways: 1,2,3,4,5\n\nWe'll consider t from 0 to 20.\n\nWe start at (0,0, []): \n  y=0 -> safe (not a freeway).\n  Then we can choose actions: \n      U: leads to y_next=1 at turn 51 (absolute turn 50+1=51) -> then at the next state, we will be at (1,1) and we must check: at turn 51, freeway 1: is it unsafe? \n          Turn 51: unsafe freeways: only 8 -> so freeway 1 is safe? -> so we can go to (1,1) with action U.\n      D: not possible (y=0)\n      S: leads to (1,0) -> then at turn 51, we are at y=0 -> safe.\n\nSo we have two actions from start: U and S.\n\nWe push (1,1, ['U']) and (1,0, ['S']).\n\nNow, we process the next states.\n\nWe'll do BFS by t (the time step). We want minimal time, so we consider increasing t.\n\nWe'll use a queue and we break when we find y=9.\n\nLet me simulate:\n\nt=0: state (0,0, []) -> safe.\n\n  Action U: next state (1,1): \n        At turn 51 (absolute) we are at y=1 -> freeway 1: at turn 51, unsafe freeways are only 8 -> so safe? -> push (1,1, ['U'])\n\n  Action S: next state (1,0): safe -> push (1,0, ['S'])\n\nNow, t=1:\n\nState (1,1, ['U']): \n  Check: at turn 51, freeway 1: safe -> so we can choose next actions.\n    Actions: \n      U: y_next=2 -> at turn 52 (absolute 52), we will be at y=2 -> check: turn 52: unsafe freeways: 1,2,3,4,5 -> so freeway 2 is unsafe -> skip.\n      D: y_next=0 -> at turn 52: y=0 -> safe -> push (2,0, ['U','D'])\n      S: y_next=1 -> at turn 52: freeway 1 -> unsafe at turn 52 -> skip.\n\nState (1,0, ['S']):\n  Check: safe (y=0).\n    Actions:\n      U: y_next=1 -> at turn 52: freeway 1 -> unsafe (turn 52: freeway 1 is unsafe) -> skip.\n      D: not possible.\n      S: y_next=0 -> safe -> push (2,0, ['S','S'])\n\nSo now we have two states at t=2: (2,0, ['U','D']) and (2,0, ['S','S']).\n\nNow, t=2:\n\nState (2,0, ['U','D']): \n  Check: y=0 -> safe.\n    Actions:\n      U: y_next=1 -> at turn 53: freeway 1 -> we need to check turn 53: \n          We have not computed beyond turn 52. Let's compute for turn 53 (u=3).\n\n      We must compute the unsafe freeways for turn 53 (u=3):\n\n      Freeway 1: left-moving car: \n          Condition: 48 - 36*3 <=0<=83-36*3 -> 48-108=-60<=0, 83-108=-25<=0 -> but 0 is not in [-60,-25] -> safe.\n      Freeway 2: same -> safe.\n      Freeway 3: \n          Car3: (-24,-35,right,12): \n              Condition: -35+12*3 = -35+36=1 <=0? -> 1<=0 false -> so not covered. \n              Also, the other cars don't cover 0. -> safe.\n      Freeway 4,5: same as 3 -> safe.\n      Freeway 6,7: safe.\n      Freeway 8: \n          Car2: (0,-11,right,6): \n              Condition: -11+6*3 = -11+18=7 <=0? false -> so not covered. \n          So freeway 8 safe.\n\n      Therefore, turn 53: all freeways safe.\n\n      So at turn 53, freeway 1 is safe -> so we can go to (3,1, ['U','D','U'])\n\n      Similarly, D: not possible (at y=0)\n      S: (3,0, ['U','D','S'])\n\nState (2,0, ['S','S']): \n  Same: y=0 -> safe.\n    Actions: same as above: \n        U: leads to (3,1) -> and turn 53: freeway 1 safe -> push (3,1, ['S','S','U'])\n        S: (3,0, ['S','S','S'])\n\nNow, we have states at t=3: \n  (3,1, ['U','D','U'])\n  (3,0, ['U','D','S'])\n  (3,1, ['S','S','U'])\n  (3,0, ['S','S','S'])\n\nWe continue. We are at t=3, absolute turn 53.\n\nNow, we want to get to y=9. We are at y=0 or y=1.\n\nWe can try to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut note: we need to avoid future collisions? But we computed that beyond turn 52, all freeways are safe? \n\nLet me check for turn 54: \n  Freeway 1: u=4: [48-36*4, 83-36*4] = [48-144, 83-144] = [-96,-61] -> 0 not in.\n  Freeway 2: same.\n  Freeway 3: car3: -35+12*4=-35+48=13>0 -> not covered.\n  Freeway 8: car2: -11+6*4=13>0 -> not covered.\n\nSo indeed, after turn 52, no freeway is unsafe.\n\nTherefore, we can safely move up from any freeway without waiting.\n\nSo the minimal steps from here: \n\nFrom y=1 at t=3: we need 8 more moves (to get to y=9) -> total turns = 3+8 = 11.\nFrom y=0 at t=3: we need 9 more moves -> total 12.\n\nBut we can also move faster: from y=1 at t=3, we can go up 8 times: that's 8 moves, so at t=11 we are at y=9.\n\nSimilarly, from y=0 at t=3: we need 9 moves, so at t=12.\n\nBut we have two states at t=3 at y=1: \n  (3,1, ['U','D','U']) and (3,1, ['S','S','U'])\n\nWe can then do 8 U's: so the sequence:\n\nFor the first: \n  t=3: at turn 53, we are at y=1 -> then we choose U for 8 times: \n      t=3: action U -> y=2 at turn 54 (safe, because freeway 2 at turn 54: safe) \n      t=4: U -> y=3 at turn 55: safe\n      ... \n      until t=10: U -> y=9 at turn 60.\n\nSo total actions: 11 actions (from turn 50 to 60).\n\nSimilarly for the other: \n  (3,1, ['S','S','U']) -> then 8 U's: same total 11 actions.\n\nBut which one is minimal? Both are 11.\n\nBut note: we have a state at t=3 at y=0: we can do 9 U's: then at t=12 we are at y=9. That would be 12 turns.\n\nSo the minimal is 11.\n\nBut we have two sequences that take 11 turns. We can choose either.\n\nBut note: the problem asks for minimal number of turns H. H is the number of turns in the sequence? The sequence is for turns starting at t_1=50 and going for H turns? Then the last action is at turn 50+H-1, and then we are at y=9 at turn 50+H.\n\nIn our BFS, the state (t, y) is at turn 50+t. We have taken t actions (from turn 50 to 50+t-1) and we are at y at turn 50+t.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 50+H, we must be at y=9 at state (H,9). We have taken H actions (from turn 50 to 50+H-1).\n\nSo for the sequence of 11 actions, we have H=11, and we are at y=9 at turn 50+11 = 61.\n\nNow, we have two sequences that are 11 turns:\n\nSequence1: \n  Actions: ['U','D','U'] + 8 times 'U' -> \n      turn50: U -> then at turn51: y=1\n      turn51: D -> then at turn52: y=0\n      turn52: U -> then at turn53: y=1\n      then turn53 to turn60: 8 U's -> at turn61: y=9.\n\nBut wait: we have 3 actions in the initial part and then 8, total 11 actions.\n\nSequence2: \n  Actions: ['S','S','U'] + 8 times 'U'\n      turn50: S -> at turn51: y=0\n      turn51: S -> at turn52: y=0\n      turn52: U -> at turn53: y=1\n      then turn53 to turn60: 8 U's -> at turn61: y=9.\n\nBut we must check the safety for the entire sequence.\n\nCheck sequence1: \n  Turn50: action U -> at turn50 we are at y=0 (safe). Then we move to y=1 at turn51.\n  Turn51: we are at (turn51, y=1): freeway1 at turn51: safe (since unsafe only freeway8) -> safe.\n  Then we do D: so at turn51 we are at y=1, then we move to y=0 at turn52.\n  Turn52: we are at (turn52, y=0): safe.\n  Then we do U: so at turn52 we are at y=0, then move to y=1 at turn53.\n  Turn53: we are at (turn53, y=1): freeway1 at turn53: safe (as computed) -> safe.\n  Then we do 8 U's: \n        Turn53: U -> to y=2 at turn54 -> at turn54: freeway2: safe? we computed that after turn52 all are safe -> yes.\n        Turn54: U -> to y=3 at turn55: safe\n        ... until turn60: U -> to y=9 at turn61: safe.\n\nSo sequence1 is safe.\n\nCheck sequence2:\n  Turn50: S -> at turn50: y=0 -> safe; then move to y=0 at turn51.\n  Turn51: S -> at turn51: y=0 -> safe; then move to y=0 at turn52.\n  Turn52: U -> at turn52: y=0 -> safe; then move to y=1 at turn53.\n  Then same as above.\n\nSo both are safe.\n\nWe can choose either. But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns\", and both have H=11.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H<11?\n\nWe started at y=0. The minimal without waiting is 9 turns. But we had to avoid turn52 for freeways 1-5 and turn50,51 for freeway8.\n\nWe tried to go up at turn50: \n  Then at turn51 we were at y=1 (safe). But then we could not go up at turn51 because that would put us at y=2 at turn52 -> unsafe (freeway2 at turn52 unsafe). And we could not stay at y=1 at turn52 -> unsafe (freeway1 at turn52 unsafe). So we had to go down to y=0 at turn52.\n\nThen at turn52 we were at y=0 -> safe, then we went up at turn52 to y=1 at turn53 -> safe. Then we can go up.\n\nTotal: \n  turn50: U -> to y1 at t51\n  turn51: D -> to y0 at t52\n  turn52: U -> to y1 at t53\n  then 8 U's: from t53 to t60: 8 moves -> total 11.\n\nAlternatively, we could have waited at y=0 for two turns (turn50: S, turn51: S) then at turn52: we are at y=0. Then we go up at turn52 to y1 at turn53 -> same.\n\nBut is there a way to get to y=9 in 10 turns? \n\nSuppose we do:\n\nWe must avoid being on freeways 1-5 at turn52, and freeway8 at turn50 and turn51.\n\nWe start at turn50: we cannot go to freeway8 at turn51? But we can go to freeway1 at turn51 (which is safe) and then we cannot be on freeway1 at turn52? So we must leave freeway1 by turn52? \n\nBut at turn51 we are at freeway1. Then at turn51 we can only move to y=0 or y=2? \n\nBut if we move to y=2 at turn51? Then at turn52 we would be at y=2 -> unsafe (freeway2 at turn52).\n\nAlternatively, we move to y=0 at turn51? Then we avoid the freeway at turn52? But then we are at y=0 at turn52.\n\nThen at turn52 we can go to y=1? But that is safe at turn53? Then we need 8 more moves: total 10 moves? \n\nWait: \n  turn50: U -> to y1 at t51\n  turn51: D -> to y0 at t52\n  turn52: U -> to y1 at t53\n  ... then we need to go from y1 to y9: 8 moves -> from t53 to t60: 8 moves -> total 11 moves.\n\nAlternatively, at turn51 we stay at y1? But then at turn52 we are at y1 -> unsafe.\n\nOr at turn50: we don't move (S) -> then at turn51 we are at y0. Then at turn51: we go up to y1? Then at turn52 we are at y1 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot avoid the two turns of waiting? \n\nBut note: we could go to freeway6 or 7? \n\nAt turn50: we go up to y1 (safe) at turn51.\nAt turn51: we go up to y2 at turn52 -> unsafe (freeway2 at turn52).\n\nAt turn51: we go to y0 (safe) at turn52.\n\nBut what if at turn50 we do nothing? Then at turn51 we are at y0. Then at turn51 we do nothing? Then at turn52 we are at y0. Then at turn52 we go up to y1 at turn53 (safe). Then we can go up 8 times: total 11.\n\nAlternatively, at turn50: we go up to y1 at turn51 (safe). Then at turn51: we cannot go up (because then at turn52 we are at y2 -> unsafe). We cannot stay (at turn52 we are at y1 -> unsafe). We must go down to y0 at turn52 (safe). Then at turn52: we go up to y1 at turn53 (safe). Then 8 ups: 11.\n\nSo minimal is 11.\n\nWe can choose either sequence. Let's choose the one that goes up immediately:\n\nSequence: \n  turn50: U\n  turn51: D\n  turn52: U\n  then 8 U's: from turn53 to turn60.\n\nBut we must write the actions for turns 50,51,...,60? That's 11 actions.\n\nThe sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: D\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\nTurn 57: U\nTurn 58: U\nTurn 59: U\nTurn 60: U  -> at turn61 we are at y=9? \n\nBut note: after the last action at turn60, we are at turn61 at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1+H-1, and we reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1? \n\nWait, the update: \n  At turn t, we choose a_t, then we update to y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nSo at turn 50: we do a_50, then at the end of turn50 we have y_51 = y_50 + delta_50.\n\nBut we start at turn50 at position (0,0). Then after action a_50, we are at turn51 at position (0, y_51).\n\nSimilarly, after action at turn60, we are at turn61 at y_61.\n\nWe require y_{50+H} = 9? \n\nBut note: the problem says: we take actions {a_{t_1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} and we reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and we reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1.\n\nBut let me see the indices:\n\nAt turn t_1 (50), we are at (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0). Then we take action a_{t_1} (a_50) to get to y_{t_1+1} = y_{51}.\n\nThen we take a_{t_1+1} (a_51) to get to y_{52}, etc.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1\"? \n\nNo: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" -> so the last action is at t_1+H-1, and after that action we are at turn t_1+H. So we require y_{t_1+H} = 9.\n\nIn our sequence: \n  After 0 actions: at turn50: y50=0\n  After 1 action (at turn50): y51 = 0+1 = 1 (if U)\n  After 2 actions: y52 = 1-1=0 (if D)\n  After 3 actions: y53 = 0+1=1 (if U)\n  After 4 actions: y54=2\n  ... \n  After 11 actions: y61=9.\n\nSo we require H such that 50+H = 61 -> H=11.\n\nSo the sequence has 11 actions: from a_50 to a_60.\n\nWe can write:\n\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: D\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\nTurn 57: U\nTurn 58: U\nTurn 59: U\nTurn 60: U\n\nBut we have 11 lines.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the other sequence:\n\nTurn 50: S\nTurn 51: S\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\n...\nTurn 60: U  -> 11 actions as well.\n\nWe can choose either. Let me choose the first one.\n\nBut note: we must avoid collision at every step.\n\nWe already checked the first sequence.\n\nWe can write the answer.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we found H=11.\n\nIs there a sequence with H=10? \n\nSuppose we try to go to freeway6 at turn51? \n\nWe start at y0 at turn50.\nAt turn50: we can go up to y1 (freeway1) at turn51 -> safe.\nThen at turn51: we can go up to y2 at turn52 -> unsafe (freeway2 at turn52) -> not allowed.\n\nOr we go down to y0 at turn52 -> safe, then at turn52 we go up to y1 at turn53 -> safe, then we need 8 more moves -> 10 moves from start? \n\nBut the moves: \n  turn50: U (to y1 at turn51) -> 1\n  turn51: D (to y0 at turn52) -> 2\n  turn52: U (to y1 at turn53) -> 3\n  then 8 U's: 3+8=11.\n\nIf we try to go faster: \n\nAt turn50: we do nothing? Then turn51: we are at y0.\nAt turn51: we go up to y1 -> then at turn52 we are at y1 -> unsafe.\n\nAt turn50: we go up to y1 at turn51 (safe).\nAt turn51: we go to y2? -> unsafe at turn52.\n\nSo we must avoid freeway1 at turn52? and we cannot jump over freeways? \n\nTherefore, we cannot do it in less than 11.\n\nSo the answer is H=11 and the sequence as above.\n\nBut note: we have two sequences. We'll choose the one that moves immediately:\n\nTurn50: U\nTurn51: D\nTurn52: U\nTurn53: U\nTurn54: U\nTurn55: U\nTurn56: U\nTurn57: U\nTurn58: U\nTurn59: U\nTurn60: U\n\nNow, write in the boxed format.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: D\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\nTurn 57: U\nTurn 58: U\nTurn 59: U\nTurn 60: U\n}\n\nBut we have 11 turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the sequence without the turn numbers? The problem says: \n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\"\n\"Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1+1}\"\n...\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: D\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\nTurn 57: U\nTurn 58: U\nTurn 59: U\nTurn 60: U\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn60, and we reach (0,9) at turn61.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to reach at turn t_1+H-1? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd we are at (0,9) at turn t_1+H, because after the last action (at turn t_1+H-1) we update to turn t_1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1\" is not explicitly stated. \n\nLet me reread: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nBut in the update rule: at turn T, we are at (0, y_T). Then we choose a_T, and then we are at (0, y_{T+1}) at turn T+1.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at a turn, we need that at some turn T, y_T=9.\n\nIn our sequence, we are at (0,9) at turn61.\n\nBut the problem does not specify at which turn we must be at (0,9). It only says we start at turn50 and we take H turns of actions. Then after the H actions, we are at (0,9) at turn50+H.\n\nSo H=11.\n\nTherefore, the sequence above is correct.\n\nBut to be sure, let's simulate the positions:\n\nTurn50: start at (0,0). Action U -> at turn51: (0,1)\nTurn51: at (0,1), action D -> at turn52: (0,0)\nTurn52: at (0,0), action U -> at turn53: (0,1)\nTurn53: at (0,1), action U -> at turn54: (0,2)\nTurn54: at (0,2), action U -> at turn55: (0,3)\nTurn55: at (0,3), action U -> at turn56: (0,4)\nTurn56: at (0,4), action U -> at turn57: (0,5)\nTurn57: at (0,5), action U -> at turn58: (0,6)\nTurn58: at (0,6), action U -> at turn59: (0,7)\nTurn59: at (0,7), action U -> at turn60: (0,8)\nTurn60: at (0,8), action U -> at turn61: (0,9)\n\nWe are at (0,9) at turn61, which is 50+11.\n\nNow, we must check collisions:\n\nTurn50: y=0 -> safe.\nTurn51: y=1 -> freeway1 at turn51: safe (only freeway8 unsafe) -> safe.\nTurn52: y=0 -> safe.\nTurn53: y=1 -> freeway1 at turn53: safe (as computed) -> safe.\nTurn54: y=2 -> freeway2 at turn54: safe (after turn52, freeway2 safe) -> safe.\n... and so on until turn60: y=8 -> freeway8 at turn60: safe? \n        We computed that freeway8 at turn60: u=10 -> car2: -11+6*10=49>0 -> not covered. -> safe.\n\nSo no collisions.\n\nTherefore, the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 50 is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by considering the car positions at each turn.\n\n- At turn 50, the player is at \\((0, 0)\\). Moving up (U) to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 51 is safe because freeway 1 is safe at turn 51 (only freeway 8 is unsafe at turns 50 and 51).\n- At turn 51, the player is at \\((0, 1)\\). Moving down (D) to \\(y = 0\\) at turn 52 is safe because \\(y = 0\\) is not a freeway.\n- At turn 52, the player is at \\((0, 0)\\). Moving up (U) to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 53 is safe because freeway 1 is safe at turn 53 (all freeways are safe after turn 52).\n- From turn 53 to turn 60, moving up (U) each turn advances the player from \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 9\\) by turn 61, and all freeways are safe after turn 52.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n```\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: D\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\nTurn 57: U\nTurn 58: U\nTurn 59: U\nTurn 60: U\n```\n\nThis sequence results in the player reaching \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 61 (i.e., after 11 actions). Collisions are avoided as verified by the car positions:\n- Turn 50: \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway).\n- Turn 51: \\(y = 1\\); freeway 1 safe (unsafe freeways: only 8).\n- Turn 52: \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n- Turn 53: \\(y = 1\\); freeway 1 safe (all freeways safe after turn 52).\n- Turns 54–60: \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 8\\); all freeways safe after turn 52.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 50: \text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 51: \text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 52: \text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 53: \text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 54: \text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 55: \text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 56: \text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 57: \text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 58: \text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 59: \text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 60: \text{U} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 52, and I start at y=0. Each turn, I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but I have to stay within y=0 to y=9.\n\nThe collision rules: I collide if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T where there's a car with 0 in its span at that turn. But when I move, at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I move to y_{T+1} at the end of the turn, so during turn T, I'm on y_T, and I won't be on y_{T+1} until turn T+1. So if I move up or down, at turn T, I'm still on y_T, and I only check cars on that freeway for collision at turn T.\n\nThe note says: if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, even if 0 is in their span at T, but it might be out at T+1 when I arrive. But for the freeway I'm leaving, I need to check at turn T.\n\nLet me read the collision part carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, I am on freeway y_T. I perform an action, which determines y_{T+1}. But during turn T, I am on y_T, so I check for collision with cars on freeway y_T at turn T. If there is a car on y_T with 0 in its span at turn T, I collide.\n\nThen, at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, and I check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe movement happens after the collision check, I think. Let's see the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so at turn t, I am at y_t, I choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nAnd collision is checked at turn T based on y_T and the car positions at T.\n\nSo, for each turn, when I am at position (0, y_t), I need that for the freeway y_t, at turn t, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nNow, the cars are moving. Each car has a head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nFor left-moving cars, span moves left, so h and τ decrease by s per turn.\n\nFor right-moving, span moves right, h and τ increase by s per turn.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor left-moving, head is the right end, I think? Let's see the update.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, it says Span(t1) = [h, τ], and h and τ, but in the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nIn the table, for example, freeway 1: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nBut for left-moving, if h is head and it's moving left, head should be the front, so for left-moving, head is on the right, tail on the left? Let's see.\n\nIn the update: left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, the positions are decreasing, so if [h, τ] at t1, with h and τ, and h - sΔT, τ - sΔT, so if h > τ, then the span is from higher to lower? But typically, we think of lower to higher.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-24, 11, left, 36). h = -24, τ = 11. But -24 < 11, so [h, τ] = [-24, 11], which is from -24 to 11, so it's a car from x=-24 to x=11 at t1.\n\nThen at T, it moves to [ -24 - s(T-t1), 11 - s(T-t1) ], so since s>0, both decrease, so the car moves left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, it says: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head, I think.\n\nFor right-moving, head should be the front, so if moving right, head has higher x.\n\nIn the update: right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSo [τ, h] means from τ to h, with τ < h I assume, since it's a span.\n\nIn the car state, for right-moving, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), so for example, freeway 3: (-48, -59, right, 12), but -48 and -59, -48 > -59, so if head is -48, tail is -59, then for right-moving, span should be [tail, head] = [-59, -48] at t1, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the notation.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: given (head, tail, direction, speed), and Span(t1) = [h, τ], which for freeway 1 is [-24,11], so h = -24, τ = 11, and since moving left, at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT].\n\nNow, h = -24, τ = 11, so at t1, the car occupies x from -24 to 11.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, it says: Span(t1) = [τ, h], so for a car (head, tail, dir, speed), for right-moving, Span(t1) = [tail, head].\n\nFor example, freeway 3: (-48, -59, right, 12), head = -48, tail = -59, so tail = -59, head = -48, so Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48], and at T, [ -59 + sΔT, -48 + sΔT].\n\nIn the table, for freeway 3, it has three cars: (-48, -59, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFor (36, 25, right, 12): head=36, tail=25, but 36 > 25, so tail=25, head=36, Span(t1) = [25,36]? But it says [τ, h] = [tail, head] = [25,36], but 25 to 36, which is increasing, good.\n\nBut tail should be less than head for right-moving? Here tail=25, head=36, so [25,36] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, (0, -11, right, 12): head=0, tail=-11, so [τ, h] = [-11, 0] at t1.\n\nAnd (-48, -59, right, 12): head=-48, tail=-59, so [τ, h] = [-59, -48] at t1.\n\nNow for left-moving, like freeway 1: (-24,11,left,36), head=-24, tail=11, Span(t1)=[h,τ]=[-24,11].\n\nNow, the collision is when 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway I'm on.\n\nI start at y=0 at turn 52. But y=0 is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to y=8. So at y=0, I think there are no cars, so I'm safe. Similarly, y=9 is the goal, no cars.\n\nThe freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe zones with no cars.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9, crossing y=1 to y=8.\n\nAt each turn, when I'm on a freeway y, I need that no car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at turn 52, and I can move to y=1 or stay, etc.\n\nThe position is (0,y), so x=0 always, and y from 0 to 9.\n\nCars are on the freeways, but they have spans in x-direction, and I'm at x=0, so collision if 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nNow, t1 = 52 is the current turn.\n\nI need to find actions from turn 52 onwards for H turns, to reach y=9.\n\nMinimize H.\n\nFirst, let's list the car positions at turn 52 for each freeway, since t1=52.\n\nt1=52, so at turn T, ΔT = T - 52.\n\nFor a car on freeway i, at turn T, the span depends on direction and speed.\n\nLet me denote for each freeway, the cars and their spans at turn T.\n\nSince I need to avoid when 0 is in span, I need to find for each freeway, at which turns 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nThat is, for each freeway, the times when it is blocked at x=0.\n\nThen, for each y from 1 to 8, I have a set of forbidden times when I cannot be on that y.\n\nThen I need to plan a path from turn 52 at y=0 to some turn at y=9, with minimal turns, moving U, D, S, and for each turn when I'm on y=k for k=1 to 8, the time must not be forbidden.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway, the times when 0 is in some car's span.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nCars: only one car: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nAt t1=52, span [h,τ] = [-24,11]\n\nAt turn T, span [ -24 - 36*(T-52) , 11 - 36*(T-52) ]\n\n0 is in span if -24 -36ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 11 -36ΔT, where ΔT = T-52\n\nSo -24 -36ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 11 -36ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -24 -36ΔT ≤ 0 => -36ΔT ≤ 24 => ΔT ≥ -24/36 = -2/3, but since ΔT ≥0, always true for T≥52.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 11 -36ΔT => 36ΔT ≤ 11 => ΔT ≤ 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nSince ΔT integer, ΔT ≤ 0? 11/36 <1, so ΔT ≤ 0, but ΔT = T-52 ≥0, so only at ΔT=0, T=52, 0 ≤ 11, true.\n\nAt T=52, ΔT=0, span [-24,11], 0 is between -24 and 11, yes.\n\nAt T=53, ΔT=1, span [-24-36, 11-36] = [-60, -25], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for higher T, more negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, only at T=52, 0 is occupied.\n\nBut at T=52, I am at y=0, not on freeway 1. I am on freeway only when y between 1 and 8.\n\nAt turn T, if I am on y=1, then I need to avoid when 0 occupied.\n\nBut for y=1, at T=52, 0 occupied, so I cannot be on y=1 at T=52.\n\nAt other times, not occupied, so safe to be on y=1 except at T=52.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2\n\nCars: same as freeway 1? (-24,11,left,36)\n\nIn the table, freeway 2: (-24,11,left,36), same as y=1.\n\nSo similarly, only at T=52, 0 occupied, other times not.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3\n\nCars: three cars: (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst, for right-moving, span at T is [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] for each car.\n\ns=12 for all.\n\nΔT = T-52\n\nFirst car: head=-48, tail=-59, so at t1, span [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T, [ -59 + 12ΔT, -48 + 12ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -59 +12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +12ΔT\n\nWhich requires -59 +12ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 +12ΔT\n\nFirst: -59 +12ΔT ≤ 0 => 12ΔT ≤ 59 => ΔT ≤ 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so ΔT ≤ 4 since integer\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 +12ΔT => 48 ≤ 12ΔT => ΔT ≥ 4\n\nSo for ΔT=4, T=56, span [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], so 0 ≤ 0 is true, so 0 in span.\n\nΔT=4, T=56.\n\nNow, is it inclusive? 0 ≤ 0, yes.\n\nAt ΔT=5, [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nAt ΔT=3, [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=56, for this car, 0 in span? But there are multiple cars.\n\nThis is for one car.\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,12), head=36, tail=25, so span at t1 [25,36]\n\nAt T, [25 +12ΔT, 36 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in [25+12ΔT, 36+12ΔT]? Since both positive, and increasing, min is 25>0 at ΔT=0, so never ≤0, so 0 never in span for this car.\n\nThird car: (0,-11,right,12), head=0, tail=-11, so span at t1 [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T, [ -11 +12ΔT, 0 +12ΔT ] = [ -11 +12ΔT, 12ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -11 +12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 12ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -11 +12ΔT ≤ 0 => 12ΔT ≤ 11 => ΔT ≤ 11/12 <1, so ΔT=0\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 12ΔT, true for ΔT≥0\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=52, span [-11,0], 0≤0 true, so 0 in span.\n\nAt ΔT=1, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 3:\n\n- At T=52, the third car has span [-11,0], so 0 occupied.\n\n- At T=56, the first car has span [-11,0], so 0 occupied.\n\n- Other times, no car has 0 in span? Let's see.\n\nAt T=52, third car occupies 0.\n\nAt T=56, first car occupies 0.\n\nNow, is there any other time? For example, second car never.\n\nWhat about between? At T=53, first car: [-59+12, -48+12]=[-47,-36], not 0\n\nThird car: [-11+12, 12]=[1,12], not 0\n\nSimilarly, only T=52 and T=56 have 0 occupied on y=3.\n\nT=52 and T=56.\n\nNow freeway 4: y=4\n\nCars: same as freeway 3? (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nIdentical to freeway 3, so same times blocked: T=52 and T=56.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: y=5, same cars, so also blocked at T=52 and T=56.\n\nNow freeway 6: y=6\n\nCars: (60,49,right,6)\n\nhead=60, tail=49, so for right-moving, span [τ, h] = [49,60]\n\nAt T, [49 +6ΔT, 60 +6ΔT]\n\nSince both ≥49>0, 0 never in span, so freeway 6 is always safe, no car covers 0 at any time.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: y=7, same car (60,49,right,6), so also always safe.\n\nNow freeway 8: y=8\n\nCars: (60,49,right,6), and (12,1,right,6)\n\nFirst car (60,49,right,6): span at T [49+6ΔT, 60+6ΔT], always >0, never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6), head=12, tail=1, so span at t1 [τ, h] = [1,12]\n\nAt T, [1 +6ΔT, 12 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in span? 1 +6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 12 +6ΔT? Since 1+6ΔT ≥1>0, left end >0, so never ≤0, so 0 never in span. Thus freeway 8 is always safe.\n\nSummary of forbidden times:\n\n- Freeway 1 (y=1): blocked at T=52 only\n\n- Freeway 2 (y=2): blocked at T=52 only (same as y=1)\n\n- Freeway 3 (y=3): blocked at T=52 and T=56\n\n- Freeway 4 (y=4): blocked at T=52 and T=56\n\n- Freeway 5 (y=5): blocked at T=52 and T=56\n\n- Freeway 6 (y=6): always safe\n\n- Freeway 7 (y=7): always safe\n\n- Freeway 8 (y=8): always safe\n\nNow, I start at turn 52, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nEach move, I can change y by -1, 0, +1, but y=0 to y=9, so to go up, I need to increase y.\n\nMinimal turns: since I need to go from y=0 to y=9, the shortest path is to go up every turn, which would take 9 moves: from turn 52 to turn 60, y=0 to y=9.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on forbidden y at forbidden times.\n\nNow, let's see if I can go directly up.\n\nSuppose I start at T=52, y=0.\n\nAt T=52, I choose action. If I go up, to y=1 at T=53? Let's think in terms of turns.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nAt T=52, y=0.\n\nI choose a_{52}, which sets y_{53}.\n\nIf I choose U, then y_{53} = 1.\n\nAt turn T=52, I am on y=0, which is safe.\n\nThen at T=53, I am on y=1, but y=1 is blocked only at T=52, not at T=53, so safe.\n\nThen I can go to y=2 at T=54, and so on.\n\nBut let's list the sequence.\n\nIf I go up every turn:\n\nTurn 52: at y=0, choose U, so at turn 53, y=1\n\nTurn 53: at y=1, choose U, to y=2 at T=54\n\nBut at turn 53, I am on y=1, and y=1 is only blocked at T=52, not T=53, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 54: at y=2, choose U, to y=3 at T=55\n\ny=2 blocked only at T=52, not T=54, safe.\n\nTurn 55: at y=3, choose U, to y=4 at T=56\n\nNow, at turn 55, I am on y=3.\n\ny=3 is blocked at T=52 and T=56.\n\nT=55 is not blocked, so safe.\n\nThen turn 56: at y=4? Let's see positions.\n\nAfter turn 55, y=4? Sequence:\n\nStart T=52, y=0\n\nAfter action a_{52}=U, at T=53, y=1\n\nAfter a_{53}=U, at T=54, y=2\n\nAfter a_{54}=U, at T=55, y=3\n\nAfter a_{55}=U, at T=56, y=4\n\nAt turn 55, I am at y=3, and T=55, which is not blocked for y=3 (blocked at 52 and 56), so safe.\n\nThen at turn 56, I am at y=4.\n\ny=4 is blocked at T=56.\n\nBecause freeway 4 blocked at T=56.\n\nAt T=56, I am on y=4, and it is blocked, so collision.\n\nCannot be on y=4 at T=56.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=56, I am at y=4, which is forbidden.\n\nIf I choose to stay or something else.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nAt turn 55, I am at y=3, T=55.\n\nInstead of going up, I could stay or go down, but that might not help.\n\nI could delay.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 are always safe, and y=1,2 only blocked at T=52, which is past, so from T=53 onwards, all freeways except y=3,4,5 have no blocks except at specific times.\n\ny=3,4,5 blocked at T=56.\n\nT=56 is a problem.\n\nIn the direct path, I reach y=4 at T=56, which is bad.\n\nI could go slower or faster.\n\nMinimal H is at least 9, since 9 moves up.\n\nBut with delay, H might be more.\n\nI could reach y=9 earlier by going up faster, but I can only change by 1 per turn, so min 9 turns to go from 0 to 9.\n\nFrom start to end, min 9 actions, from turn 52 to turn 60 if I go up every turn.\n\nTurn 52: start at y=0, after 0 actions.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nt1=52, start at turn 52, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{52}, at turn 53, y= y + Δy\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 52 + H, I am at y_{52+H}.\n\nI need y_{52+H} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1, so indices.\n\nSet t=0 at turn 52.\n\nSo time t: turn 52 + t, for t=0,1,2,...\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\ny_0 = 0 (at turn 52)\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nI need to find min H such that y_H =9, after H actions.\n\ny_H is at turn 52 + H.\n\nFor t from 0 to H-1, actions.\n\ny_H =9.\n\nMin H=9 if I go up every step.\n\nBut as above, if I go up every step:\n\nt=0: y=0, a=U, y1=1 at turn 53\n\nt=1: y=1, a=U, y2=2 at turn 54\n\nt=2: y=2, a=U, y3=3 at turn 55\n\nt=3: y=3, a=U, y4=4 at turn 56\n\nBut at turn 56 (time t=4, since t=0 is turn52, t=1 turn53, ..., t=4 turn56), y=4, and y=4 is blocked at turn56, collision.\n\nIf at t=3 (turn55), y=3, instead of U, I choose S, then y4=3 at turn56.\n\nBut at turn56, y=3, and y=3 is also blocked at T=56, since freeway3 blocked at T=56.\n\nSo same problem.\n\nIf I choose D, go down to y=2 at turn56, but y=2 is only blocked at T=52, not T=56, so safe, but I'm going down, which is away from goal.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=3,4,5 at T=56.\n\ny=3,4,5 all blocked at T=56.\n\nSo at turn 56, I must not be on y=3,4, or 5.\n\nI could be on y=2, or y=6, etc.\n\nBut y=6,7,8 are safe.\n\nIn the direct path, I am on y=4 at T=56.\n\nI need to either be higher or lower at T=56.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=6 at T=56, that would be safe.\n\nBut from start, at T=52, y=0.\n\nTo be at y=6 at T=56, that is in 4 turns, from y=0 to y=6, I need to increase by 6 in 4 turns, but each turn I can only increase by 1, so max increase is 1 per turn, so in 4 turns, I can be at most y=4, at T=56 (from t=0 to t=4, 4 actions, y from 0 to 4).\n\nt=0: turn52, y0=0\n\na_t for t=0 to H-1\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 52+H, y_H.\n\nTo have y_H=6 at turn 52+H.\n\nIf H=6, turn 58, y=6.\n\nBut at T=56, I need to not be on y=3,4,5.\n\nNow, minimal H=9, but I might need to take more turns if I have to wait.\n\nBut let's see if I can do in 9 turns by adjusting.\n\nSince y=1 and y=2 are only blocked at T=52, which is past, so from T=53 onwards, I can be on y=1 or y=2 safely.\n\ny=3,4,5 are blocked only at T=56, so I need to not be on them at T=56.\n\ny=6,7,8 always safe.\n\nI start at T=52, y=0.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nOne way: I can stay at y=0 for some turns, but y=0 is safe, but staying might increase H.\n\nI can go up to y=2 or something before T=56.\n\nList the turns: T=52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,...\n\nAt T=52, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nI must choose action for turn 52.\n\nIf I go up to y=1 at T=53.\n\nAt T=53, y=1, safe (since only blocked at T=52).\n\nThen I can go up to y=2 at T=54.\n\nAt T=54, y=2, safe.\n\nNow at T=55, I need to choose action.\n\nIf I go up to y=3 at T=56, but at T=56, y=3 is blocked.\n\nIf I stay, y=2 at T=56, which is safe since y=2 not blocked at T=56.\n\nBut then at T=56, I am at y=2.\n\nThen from there, I need to go to y=9, which is 7 more steps, so H would be more.\n\nMinimal might be 9, but here I am at T=56 y=2, after 4 actions? Let's count.\n\nActions:\n\nt=0 (T=52): a=U, to y=1 at T=53\n\nt=1 (T=53): a=U, to y=2 at T=54\n\nt=2 (T=54): a=U, to y=3 at T=55? No.\n\nAt time t, after action a_t, y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nBetter to list turn by turn.\n\nTurn 52: position y=0, choose a_52\n\nIf a_52=U, then at turn 53, y=1\n\nTurn 53: position y=1, choose a_53, if U, then turn 54 y=2\n\nTurn 54: position y=2, choose a_54, if U, then turn 55 y=3\n\nTurn 55: position y=3, choose a_55\n\nIf a_55=U, then turn 56 y=4, which is bad.\n\nIf a_55=S, then turn 56 y=3, also bad for y=3.\n\nIf a_55=D, then turn 56 y=2, which is safe.\n\nBut y=2 at turn 56.\n\nThen from turn 56, y=2, I need to go to y=9, which is 7 moves up, so at turn 63, y=9.\n\nH=11 actions? From turn 52 to 63, 11 turns? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 56, after action a_55, y=2.\n\nThen turn 56: position y=2, choose action, say U to y=3 at turn 57\n\nTurn 57: y=3, U to y=4 at 58\n\nTurn 58: y=4, U to y=5 at 59\n\nTurn 59: y=5, U to y=6 at 60\n\nTurn 60: y=6, U to y=7 at 61\n\nTurn 61: y=7, U to y=8 at 62\n\nTurn 62: y=8, U to y=9 at 63\n\nSo at turn 63, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 52 to 63, that's 11 actions? Turns: turn 52 to turn 63 is 12 turns, but positions.\n\nStart at turn 52, y=0.\n\nAfter first action (a_52) at turn 53, y=1\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 52+k, y_k.\n\nAfter 11 actions, at turn 63, y=9? In the sequence above, after a_62, at turn 63, y=9.\n\nActions from a_52 to a_62, that's 11 actions, H=11.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 are always safe, I could go faster to higher y.\n\nBut I can only move one step per turn.\n\nAnother idea: at T=55, instead of going up or down, I could have been at a different y.\n\nFor example, if at some point I stay or move slower.\n\nSuppose I start at T=52 y=0.\n\nI can stay at y=0 for one turn: a_52=S, then at turn 53, y=0\n\nThen a_53=U, to y=1 at turn 54\n\nBut y=1 is safe at T=54.\n\nThen a_54=U, to y=2 at turn 55\n\na_55=U, to y=3 at turn 56, but y=3 at T=56 blocked.\n\nSame issue.\n\na_55=S, y=2 at turn 56, safe, but then as before.\n\nTo avoid being on y=3,4,5 at T=56, I can be below or above.\n\nBelow: at T=56, be on y=2 or less.\n\nAbove: on y=6 or more.\n\nBut at T=56, to be on y=6, I need to have reached y=6 by turn 56.\n\nFrom turn 52 y=0 to turn 56 y=6.\n\nThat requires increasing by 6 in 4 turns (from turn 52 to 56, 4 actions: a_52 to a_55, determining y at turn 53,54,55,56).\n\ny at turn 56 is after action a_55.\n\nStart: turn 52, y=0\n\nAfter a_52: turn 53, y1\n\nAfter a_53: turn 54, y2\n\nAfter a_54: turn 55, y3\n\nAfter a_55: turn 56, y4\n\ny4 = y at turn 56.\n\nI need y4 >=6 or y4 <=2 to be safe at T=56.\n\nBut y4 <=2 means I am low, then I need to climb later, which takes more turns.\n\ny4 >=6, but from y=0, in 4 actions, max y4=4, since each action can increase by at most 1.\n\ny0=0\n\ny1 <=1\n\ny2 <=2\n\ny3 <=3\n\ny4 <=4\n\nSo y4 <=4, cannot be 6.\n\nSimilarly, min y4=0 if I stay or go down.\n\nSo at T=56, I must be between y=0 and y=4, and to avoid collision, I cannot be on y=3,4,5, but y=5 is not possible since y4<=4, so y=3 or 4 are possible and forbidden.\n\ny=5 cannot be at T=56 since y<=4.\n\nSo at T=56, possible y: 0,1,2,3,4\n\nForbidden: y=3 and y=4\n\nSafe: y=0,1,2\n\nSo I must be at y=0,1, or 2 at T=56 to be safe.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should be as high as possible at T=56, so y=2.\n\nThen from y=2 at turn 56, go up to y=9 in 7 more moves, reaching turn 63, y=9, with 11 actions.\n\nBut earlier with direct, I had problem at T=56.\n\nCan I reach y=2 at T=56 with fewer actions? From y=0, to y=2 in 2 moves: a_52=U to y=1 at T=53, a_53=U to y=2 at T=54, so at T=54 I am at y=2.\n\nBut T=56 is later.\n\nAt T=54, y=2.\n\nThen I need to get to T=56.\n\nI have to spend two turns: at T=54, y=2, I can choose actions.\n\nIf I stay: a_54=S, then at T=55, y=2\n\na_55=S, at T=56, y=2\n\nOr a_54=U, to y=3 at T=55\n\nThen at T=55, y=3, which is safe only if not blocked.\n\ny=3 blocked at T=52 and T=56, not at T=55, so at T=55 y=3 is safe.\n\nThen at T=55, I can choose: if I go up, to y=4 at T=56, bad.\n\nIf stay, y=3 at T=56, bad.\n\nIf down, to y=2 at T=56, safe.\n\nBut then I am at y=2 at T=56, same as before.\n\nTo be at y=2 at T=56, I need to have y=2 at turn 56.\n\nFrom start, I can go up to y=2 quickly, then stay or move to stay at y=2 until T=56.\n\nBut staying increases H.\n\nMinimal H: I need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe obstacle is at T=56 for y=3,4,5.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 are always safe, if I can pass y=3,4,5 before or after T=56.\n\nFor example, be on y=3 before T=56 or after.\n\ny=3 blocked at T=52 and T=56, so safe at other times.\n\nSimilarly for y=4 and y=5.\n\nT=52 is the start, I am at y=0, so I cannot be on y=3 at T=52 anyway.\n\nSo for y=3, safe at T=53,54,55,57,58,... but not T=56.\n\nSimilarly for y=4 and y=5.\n\nIn the direct up path, I am on y=3 at T=55 (safe), then if I go to y=4 at T=56, bad.\n\nBut at T=55, y=3, I can instead go down to y=2 at T=56, safe, but then I am at y=2.\n\nThen I need to go up from there.\n\nBut from y=2 at T=56, to y=9 at T=63, 7 moves.\n\nTotal actions: from T=52 to T=63, 11 actions.\n\nBut I can be on y=3 at T=55, then at T=56 I go down to y=2, but that seems waste.\n\nAt T=55, y=3, I can stay, but then at T=56 y=3, bad.\n\nOr I can go down to avoid.\n\nBut another idea: since y=4 and y=5 are also blocked at T=56, I need to pass them at other times.\n\nFor example, if I delay reaching y=3.\n\nSuppose I start by staying at y=0 for some turns.\n\nBut y=0 is safe.\n\nFor instance, if I stay at y=0 until after T=56.\n\nBut T=56 is turn 56, I can be at y=0 at T=56.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9 in 9 moves, but from turn 56 y=0 to turn 65 y=9, H=13 actions, worse.\n\nNot good.\n\nI can go up to y=2 and stay there until T=56.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 52: y=0, a=S? Or U.\n\nLet's set actions to be at y=2 at T=56.\n\nTurn 52: y=0, a=U, to y=1 at T=53\n\nTurn 53: y=1, a=U, to y=2 at T=54\n\nNow at T=54, y=2\n\nI need to be at y=2 at T=56.\n\nSo at turn 54: y=2, a=S, to y=2 at T=55\n\nTurn 55: y=2, a=S, to y=2 at T=56\n\nAt T=56, y=2, safe.\n\nThen from turn 56: y=2, a=U to y=3 at T=57\n\nBut y=3 is safe at T=57? Blocked only at T=52 and T=56, T=57 is after, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 57: y=3, a=U to y=4 at T=58\n\ny=4 blocked at T=52 and T=56, not T=58, safe.\n\nTurn 58: y=4, a=U to y=5 at T=59\n\ny=5 blocked at T=52 and T=56, not T=59, safe.\n\nTurn 59: y=5, a=U to y=6 at T=60\n\ny=6 always safe.\n\nTurn 60: y=6, a=U to y=7 at T=61\n\nTurn 61: y=7, a=U to y=8 at T=62\n\nTurn 62: y=8, a=U to y=9 at T=63\n\nSo at turn 63, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from a_52 to a_62, 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut earlier with direct, I could have reached at turn 60 if no obstacle, but with obstacle, delayed.\n\nCan I do better than 11?\n\nFor example, if I can be on a higher y at T=56.\n\nBut at T=56, max y=2 if I want to be safe.\n\ny=1 or 0, but lower is worse.\n\ny=2 is best.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=3 after T=56.\n\nFor example, at T=55, I am on y=3, which is safe, then instead of going down, I stay or something, but at T=56 I have to leave.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6,7,8 are safe, I can go faster through them, but the bottleneck is the lower part.\n\nPerhaps I can go down first, but that seems silly.\n\nOr, let's list the forbidden times for each y:\n\ny=1: forbidden at T=52\n\ny=2: forbidden at T=52\n\ny=3: forbidden at T=52 and T=56\n\ny=4: forbidden at T=52 and T=56\n\ny=5: forbidden at T=52 and T=56\n\ny=6: always safe\n\netc.\n\nSince T=52 is past, from T=53 onwards, y=1 and y=2 are always safe.\n\ny=3,4,5 are safe except at T=56.\n\nSo the only problem is at T=56 for y=3,4,5.\n\nTo reach y=9 quickly, I should be as high as possible at each turn, except avoid being on y=3,4,5 at T=56.\n\nSo for turns before T=56, go up as much as possible.\n\nAt T=56, be not on y=3,4,5.\n\nAfter T=56, go up.\n\nNow, T=56 is turn 56.\n\nAt turn 55, I can be on y= something.\n\nFrom turn 52 to turn 55: 3 actions, from y=0 to y at turn 55.\n\nMax y at turn 55 is 3.\n\nMin is 0.\n\nAt turn 55, if I am at y=3, it is safe, since T=55 not blocked.\n\nThen at turn 55, I choose action for turn 55.\n\nIf I go up, to y=4 at T=56, bad.\n\nIf I go down, to y=2 at T=56, safe.\n\nIf I stay, to y=3 at T=56, bad.\n\nSo only choice is to go down to y=2 at T=56.\n\nThen at T=56, y=2, then go up.\n\nBut as before, I reach y=9 at T=63.\n\nIf at turn 55, I am at y=2, then I can go up to y=3 at T=56, but y=3 at T=56 blocked, bad.\n\nOr stay to y=2 at T=56, safe.\n\nOr down to y=1 at T=56, safe but lower.\n\nThen from y=2 at T=56, go up.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf at turn 55, I am at y=1, then I can go up to y=2 at T=56, safe.\n\nThen from y=2 at T=56, go up.\n\nBut starting from y=0, to be at y=1 at turn 55, I must have moved slower, so at turn 55 y=1 is lower than y=2 or 3, so it takes more turns to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, to be at y=1 at turn 55:\n\nTurn 52: y=0, a=S to y=0 at T=53? Or U.\n\nSuppose turn 52: a=U to y=1 at T=53\n\nThen turn 53: a=S to y=1 at T=54\n\nTurn 54: a=S to y=1 at T=55\n\nThen at turn 55: y=1, a=U to y=2 at T=56, safe.\n\nThen from T=56 y=2, same as before, go up to y=9 at T=63.\n\nBut at turn 55, y=1, which is lower than in previous where I could be at y=2 or y=3 at turn 55.\n\nIn the first scenario, when I was at y=3 at turn 55, I had to go down to y=2 at turn 56.\n\nHere at y=1 at turn 55, I go to y=2 at turn 56.\n\nThen both end up at y=2 at turn 56.\n\nThen same path up.\n\nBut to reach y=3 at turn 55, I need to have moved up faster, so for example:\n\nTurn 52: U to y=1 at T=53\n\nTurn 53: U to y=2 at T=54\n\nTurn 54: U to y=3 at T=55\n\nThen at turn 55: y=3, must go D to y=2 at T=56\n\nThen turn 56: y=2, U to y=3 at T=57\n\n Etc.\n\nAt turn 55, if I go D, I am at y=2 at T=56.\n\nIf I had been at y=2 at turn 55, I could stay to y=2 at T=56.\n\nBut in both cases, at T=56 I am at y=2.\n\nThen from there, same.\n\nBut in the first case, at turn 55 I was at y=3 and I went down, so I wasted a move by going down.\n\nIn the second case, at turn 55 I was at y=2 and stayed, no waste.\n\nBut to reach turn 55 at y=2:\n\nTurn 52: U to y=1 T=53\n\nTurn 53: U to y=2 T=54\n\nThen turn 54: S to y=2 T=55\n\nThen turn 55: S to y=2 T=56\n\nThen same.\n\nCompared to reaching y=3 at T=55: turn 52 U, turn 53 U, turn 54 U to y=3 T=55, then turn 55 D to y=2 T=56.\n\nSo at T=56, both at y=2, but in the first, I used an extra U and D that canceled, so I have one more action, but same position at T=56.\n\nIn terms of actions, to reach y=2 at T=56 with min actions.\n\nFrom y=0 at T=52, to y=2 at T=56.\n\nAt T=56, y=2 after actions.\n\nPath: a_52=U, T=53 y=1\n\na_53=U, T=54 y=2\n\na_54=S, T=55 y=2\n\na_55=S, T=56 y=2\n\nActions: 4 actions to be at y=2 at T=56.\n\na_52=U, T=53 y=1\n\na_53=S, T=54 y=1\n\na_54=U, T=55 y=2\n\na_55=S, T=56 y=2\n\nAlso 4 actions.\n\nOr a_52=S, T=53 y=0\n\na_53=U, T=54 y=1\n\na_54=U, T=55 y=2\n\na_55=S, T=56 y=2\n\nStill 4 actions.\n\nMin actions to be at y=2 at T=56 is 4, since from T=52 to T=56, 4 steps, from y=0, need to increase by 2, so at least 2 U, and 2 other actions (S or D, but D would make it harder to increase).\n\nWith 2 U and 2 S, for example.\n\nCan I do with 3 actions? a_52, a_53, a_54 determine y at T=55? No.\n\nAfter a_54, at T=55, y.\n\nTo have y at T=56 after a_55.\n\nAfter a_55, at T=56 y.\n\nWith 3 actions: a_52, a_53, a_54, set y at T=55.\n\nThen a_55 sets y at T=56.\n\nBut at T=55, y can be from 0 to 3.\n\nThen with a_55, I can go to y-1, y, y+1 at T=56.\n\nBut to be at y=2 at T=56, I need to choose a_55 based on y at T=55.\n\nBut with 3 actions, I can be at y=2 at T=55, then a_55=S to y=2 at T=56.\n\nOr y=1 at T=55, a_55=U to y=2 at T=56.\n\nOr y=3 at T=55, a_55=D to y=2 at T=56.\n\nSo I can reach y=2 at T=56 with 4 actions, but the first 3 actions can be used to reach a certain y at T=55.\n\nBut in all cases, it takes 4 actions to be at y=2 at T=56 from start.\n\nSimilarly, for the up path, to reach y=4 at T=56, it would take 4 U, but we can't because of the block.\n\nBack to the path.\n\nSo with H=11, I can reach y=9 at T=63.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=5 at T=57 or something.\n\nAfter T=56, y=3,4,5 are safe.\n\nFor instance, at T=56, I am at y=2.\n\nThen I go up: T=56 y=2, a=U to y=3 at T=57\n\nT=57 y=3, a=U to y=4 at T=58\n\nT=58 y=4, a=U to y=5 at T=59\n\nT=59 y=5, a=U to y=6 at T=60\n\nThen y=6 to y=9 in 3 more turns: T=60 y=6 U to y=7 T=61, U to y=8 T=62, U to y=9 T=63.\n\nSame as before.\n\nFrom y=2 at T=56, to y=9 at T=63, 7 actions.\n\nTotal from start: to reach T=56 y=2, took 4 actions (a_52 to a_55), then a_56 to a_62 for 7 actions, total 11 actions.\n\na_52 to a_62 is 11 actions, H=11.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nTurn 52: start y=0\n\na_52: U, turn 53 y=1\n\na_53: U, turn 54 y=2\n\na_54: S, turn 55 y=2\n\na_55: S, turn 56 y=2  (safe)\n\na_56: U, turn 57 y=3  (safe, T=57 not blocked)\n\na_57: U, turn 58 y=4  (safe, T=58 not blocked)\n\na_58: U, turn 59 y=5  (safe)\n\na_59: U, turn 60 y=6\n\na_60: U, turn 61 y=7\n\na_61: U, turn 62 y=8\n\na_62: U, turn 63 y=9\n\nSo y=9 at turn 63, after 11 actions.\n\nNow, can I save one turn?\n\nFor example, at turn 55, instead of being at y=2, I could be at y=3.\n\nThen at turn 55 y=3, I must go down to y=2 at turn 56 to avoid collision.\n\nThen at turn 56 y=2, same as above.\n\nBut to be at y=3 at turn 55: from start, a_52 U to y=1 T53, a_53 U to y=2 T54, a_54 U to y=3 T55.\n\nThen a_55 D to y=2 T56.\n\nThen a_56 U to y=3 T57, etc.\n\nNow, from a_52 to a_55: 4 actions, at T56 y=2.\n\nThen a_56 to a_62: 7 actions to y=9 at T63, same 11 actions.\n\nBut in this case, I have an extra D action, but it doesn't save time.\n\nIf at turn 55 y=3, and I could go up, but I can't because of T=56.\n\nUnless I can be on y=6 at some point, but no.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at T=56, I can be on y=6, but impossible as before.\n\nOr, I can cross y=3,4,5 before T=56.\n\nFor example, be on y=5 at T=55.\n\nThen at T=55, y=5, which is safe since not T=56.\n\nThen at T=55, I go up to y=6 at T=56.\n\nAt T=56, I am on y=6, which is always safe, so no collision.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9 faster.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nTo be at y=5 at T=55.\n\nFrom y=0 at T=52, to y=5 at T=55.\n\nThat requires 3 actions: a_52, a_53, a_54 to set y at T=55.\n\ny at T=55 after a_54.\n\nStart y=0 T52\n\na_52: to y1 at T53\n\na_53: to y2 at T54\n\na_54: to y3 at T55\n\nI need y3=5 at T=55.\n\nBut each action can increase y by at most 1, so y3 <= 3.\n\ny0=0\n\ny1 <=1\n\ny2 <=2\n\ny3 <=3\n\nSo at T=55, y <=3, cannot be 5.\n\nSimilarly, impossible to be at y=5 before T=56 except at T=55 y=3 max.\n\nAt T=56, y<=4.\n\nSo cannot be at y=5 or above at T=55 or T=56 except y=5 at T=56 is possible but blocked.\n\nSo the only way is to be at y=2 at T=56 as before, or lower.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach y=9 at turn 62 or earlier.\n\nTurn 62: if y=9 at turn 62, that means after 10 actions? Turn 52 + H, y_H=9.\n\nAt turn 62, which is T=62, y=9.\n\nTurn 62 = 52 + 10, so after 10 actions, y_{10} at turn 62.\n\nBut with obstacle, from y=0 to y=9 in 10 actions, but in the free case, min 9 actions, with obstacle, might be possible in 10.\n\nFor example, if I can avoid the delay.\n\nBut at T=56, I must not be on y=3,4,5, so I have to be on y<=2 or y>=6, but y<=4 and y>=6 impossible, so y<=2.\n\nAt T=56, y<=2.\n\nThen to reach y=9 at turn 62, which is 6 turns later.\n\nFrom y<=2 at T=56 to y=9 at T=62.\n\nT=56 to T=62 is 6 turns.\n\ny from 2 to 9, difference 7, so in 6 turns, I can increase by at most 6, to y=8 at T=62, not 9.\n\nIf y=2 at T=56, after 6 actions: a_56 to a_61, set y at T=62.\n\ny at T=62 after a_61.\n\ny_56 = y at T=56, say 2.\n\nThen y_57 <=3, ..., y_62 <= 2 + 6 =8.\n\nSo at best y=8 at T=62, not 9.\n\nIf y=1 at T=56, y_62 <=7, worse.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 at turn 62.\n\nSimilarly, turn 61: y_61 <= y_56 + 5 <= 2+5=7\n\nTurn 60: y_60 <= y_56 +4 <=6, etc.\n\nEarliest possible is turn 63 with y=9, as before.\n\nWith H=11 actions, from a_52 to a_62, to reach at turn 63.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the above, I have a sequence with 11 actions.\n\nBut I can choose how to reach y=2 at T=56.\n\nFor example, one efficient way: go up to y=2 quickly, then stay.\n\nTurn 52: U to y=1\n\nTurn 53: U to y=2\n\nThen I need to stay at y=2 for two turns to wait until after T=56.\n\nBut T=56 is the critical point.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt turn 52: position y=0, choose U, go to y=1 at turn 53\n\nTurn 53: position y=1, choose U, go to y=2 at turn 54\n\nTurn 54: position y=2, choose S, stay y=2 at turn 55\n\nTurn 55: position y=2, choose S, stay y=2 at turn 56\n\nNow turn 56: position y=2, choose U, go to y=3 at turn 57\n\nTurn 57: position y=3, choose U, go to y=4 at turn 58\n\nTurn 58: position y=4, choose U, go to y=5 at turn 59\n\nTurn 59: position y=5, choose U, go to y=6 at turn 60\n\nTurn 60: position y=6, choose U, go to y=7 at turn 61\n\nTurn 61: position y=7, choose U, go to y=8 at turn 62\n\nTurn 62: position y=8, choose U, go to y=9 at turn 63\n\nNow, at each step, no collision: for example, at turn 57, y=3, T=57 not blocked.\n\nTurn 58, y=4, T=58 not blocked, etc.\n\nIn the sequence, I have actions from turn 52 to turn 62, 11 actions.\n\nBut the player position at each turn: at turn 52, y=0, not on freeway.\n\nTurn 53, y=1, freeway 1, but at T=53, not blocked (only at 52), safe.\n\nTurn 54, y=2, safe.\n\nTurn 55, y=2, safe.\n\nTurn 56, y=2, safe.\n\nTurn 57, y=3, safe.\n\nEtc.\n\nAll good.\n\nI could have reached y=3 at turn 55, but then I have to go down, which adds an action.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 52: U to y=1 T53\n\nTurn 53: U to y=2 T54\n\nTurn 54: U to y=3 T55\n\nTurn 55: D to y=2 T56  (to avoid collision at T=56)\n\nThen turn 56: U to y=3 T57\n\n...\n\nSame as before, but I have an extra D and one less S, but still 11 actions to reach T=63 y=9.\n\nIn this case, from turn 55 to turn 56, I went down and then up, so I wasted a move.\n\nIn the first sequence, I stayed at y=2, which is fine.\n\nSo the first sequence is better, no unnecessary moves.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the actions starting from turn 52.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 3,4,5, there are multiple cars, but we already considered the blocks.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 8, there is a car (12,1,right,6), but we said it never covers 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nNow, the minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can do in 10.\n\nSuppose I reach y=9 at turn 62.\n\nThat requires y at turn 62 =9.\n\nTurn 62 = 52 + 10, so after 10 actions.\n\ny_0=0, y_{10}=9.\n\nBut y_{10} <= y_0 + 10 =10, but since y<=9, possible in 9 actions if no obstacle, but with obstacle, at some point I must have not moved up.\n\nFor example, if I go up every turn except one where I stay or something.\n\nBut in the critical point, at T=56, I must be at y<=2.\n\nT=56 is turn 56 = 52 + 4, so after 4 actions, y_4 at turn 56.\n\ny_4 <=4, and must be <=2 to be safe.\n\nThen y_{10} <= y_4 + 6 <= 2+6=8 <9, so impossible to reach y=9 at turn 62.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 63, y_{11}=9 possible with y_4=2.\n\nSo H=11 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to list actions for each turn.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1=52.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: S\n\nTurn 55: S\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nAfter a_62, at turn 63, y=9.\n\nThe sequence has 11 actions, from t=52 to t=62.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, I think.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: a_{t1} = a_52\n\nt=1: a_53\n\n...\n\nt=H-1: a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, y=9.\n\nIn this case, t1=52, H=11, so actions from a_52 to a_{52+10} = a_62.\n\na_{t1 + t} for t=0 to 10, 11 actions.\n\nAt turn 52 + 11 = 63, y=9.\n\nNow, in the output:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 + (H-1): a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nWith H=11, so up to turn 52 + 10 = 62.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: S\n\nTurn 55: S\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 54 and 55, I have S, but I could have other actions as long as at turn 56 I am at y=2.\n\nFor example, I could have gone to y=3 at turn 55 and down, but that adds a D, which might not be necessary.\n\nThe above is fine.\n\nTo make it faster in the sense of less stay, but I have to wait until after T=56 to go up through y=3,4,5.\n\nSince I can be on y=3 at T=57, etc.\n\nIn the sequence, I have two S at turn 54 and 55, but I could use one of them to go up if possible, but at turn 54, if I go up to y=3 at turn 55, then at turn 55 I must go down to y=2 at turn 56, so I end up with a D instead of S, same thing.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo the sequence is acceptable.\n\nNow, about the car on freeway 3,4,5: at T=56, blocked, but in the sequence I avoid.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 52, I go to y=1 at turn 53, but y=1 is freeway, and at T=53, it is safe, as we said.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n</think>\nTo reach the goal position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 52\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11. This sequence ensures that the player is not on freeways \\(y = 3\\), \\(y = 4\\), or \\(y = 5\\) at turn 56, as these freeways are blocked at that time. The actions are chosen to stay at \\(y = 2\\) during turns 55 and 56 to avoid the collision, then proceed upwards efficiently.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- **Turn 52**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 53. At turn 52, the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe), so no collision.\n- **Turn 53**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 54. At turn 53, \\(y = 1\\) is safe (blocked only at turn 52).\n- **Turn 54**: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 2\\) at turn 55. At turn 54, \\(y = 2\\) is safe (blocked only at turn 52).\n- **Turn 55**: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 2\\) at turn 56. At turn 55, \\(y = 2\\) is safe.\n- **Turn 56**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 57. At turn 56, \\(y = 2\\) is safe (not on \\(y = 3, 4, 5\\)).\n- **Turn 57**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 58. At turn 57, \\(y = 3\\) is safe (blocked at turns 52 and 56, not 57).\n- **Turn 58**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 59. At turn 58, \\(y = 4\\) is safe (blocked at turns 52 and 56, not 58).\n- **Turn 59**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 60. At turn 59, \\(y = 5\\) is safe (blocked at turns 52 and 56, not 59).\n- **Turn 60**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 61.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays, changing y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn. Cars move left or right at constant speeds, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway where a car covers position x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that at turn T, I'm on freeway y_T, and I collide if for that freeway, there's a car whose span includes x=0 at turn T. Also, when I move, I'm not on the new freeway until the next turn, so I only check the freeway I'm currently on for collisions.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1 = 56. Player is at (0,0), so y_{56} = 0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, I should figure out for each freeway and each turn after 56, when it's safe to be there, meaning no car covers x=0.\n\nSince the cars move linearly, I can compute for each car, the times when it covers x=0.\n\nThen for each freeway, the safe times are when no car on that freeway covers x=0 at that time.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=56.\n\nFor a car with head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nFor left-moving cars (d=left), span at time T is [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]\n\nSince t_1=56, T - t_1 is the offset, let me set δt = T - t_1, so δt >=0.\n\nFor a left-moving car: span at δt is [h - s δt, τ - s δt]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: [τ + s δt, h + s δt]\n\nIt covers x=0 if 0 is in the span, i.e., for left-moving: min <= 0 <= max, but since left-moving, h and τ, which is head and tail, but direction matters for min and max.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, it's [h - sδt, τ - sδt], and since it's moving left, if we assume head is to the right, then h > τ, so [τ - sδt, h - sδt] with τ - sδt < h - sδt.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ + sδt, h + sδt] with τ + sδt < h + sδt.\n\nIn the car state, for left-moving, it says \"head h, tail τ\" and direction left, so for left-moving, head is the right end, tail left end, so span is [tail, head] decreasing.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head is left end? Let's see the description.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut [h, τ] with h and τ, but if it's left-moving, and head is at h, tail at τ, I think h is the front, so for left-moving, front is at smaller x, but in terms of position, x decreases.\n\nIn the span, it's given as [h, τ] for left-moving at t1, but [h, τ] might not be ordered if h and τ are coordinates.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (48,83,left,36) so h=48, τ=83, but 48 to 83, and left-moving, so at t1, it's from x=48 to x=83? But left-moving, so it should be moving to decreasing x, but 48 to 83, if left-moving, head should be at higher x? I think there's inconsistency.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"for car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t1\"\n\nAnd for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nBut in freeway 1: (48,83,left,36), so h=48, τ=83, so Span(t1) = [48,83], which is from 48 to 83, and left-moving, so at T, [48 - sδt, 83 - sδt], so as time increases, both decrease, so the car is moving left.\n\nBut the span [48 - sδt, 83 - sδt], since 48 < 83, it's from left to right? No, x=48 is left, x=83 is right if we assume x-axis horizontal.\n\nTypically, in such games, x=0 is left, increasing x to the right.\n\nSo for a car, head and tail: for left-moving, head is the front, which is the right end if it's facing left? I think I need to clarify.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, [h - sδt, τ - sδt], and it covers x=0 when min <= 0 <= max.\n\nSince the car is moving left, the left end is decreasing, right end decreasing.\n\nFor [h - sδt, τ - sδt], with h and τ, in this case for freeway 1, h=48, τ=83, so at δt=0, min=48, max=83, so it covers from 48 to 83.\n\nAs δt increases, min and max decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 3,4,5, there are multiple cars.\n\nAlso for freeway 8, there are two cars.\n\nNow, for each car, I need to find when it covers x=0.\n\nThat is, for a given car, at what δt, 0 is in [low, high] for that car at that time.\n\nThen for a freeway, it is unsafe at δt if any car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that δt.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nThen for the player, at turn T = t1 + δt, y-position is y, and we are on freeway y at that turn, so we collide if freeway y is unsafe at δt.\n\nBut y changes with actions.\n\nAlso, since we start at y=0 at δt=0, and y=0 is not a freeway with cars, freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 is the goal, no cars.\n\nSo we need to go through y=1 to 8 without colliding.\n\nNow, the minimal H is at least the number of steps to go from y=0 to y=9, which is 9 steps if we go up each time, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid, so H could be more.\n\nH is the number of turns including the starting turn? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so at turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAt t=0, position is (0, y_{t1}), so at turn t1, we are at (0,0), and we take action a_{t1} to go to y_{t1+1}, and so on, until at some turn T, y_T =9, and that is after H actions.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so H actions, from turn t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nSince we start at turn t1, position y_{t1} =0, and after H actions, we are at y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nThe number of steps to increase y from 0 to 9 is at least 9, so H >=9.\n\nIf we only go up, H=9, we reach in 9 turns.\n\nBut we might collide, so we need to see if that's possible, or if we need to take detours or wait.\n\nFirst, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeways: k=1 to 8.\n\nFor each, cars are given.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (48,83,left,36) so h=48, τ=83, d=left, s=36\n\nSpan at δt: [48 - 36δt, 83 - 36δt]\n\nIt covers x=0 when 48 - 36δt <= 0 <= 83 - 36δt\n\nSince 48 - 36δt <= 0 and 0 <= 83 - 36δt\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36δt <= 0 => 36δt >=48 => δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 83 - 36δt => 36δt <=83 => δt <= 83/36 ≈2.305\n\nSo for δt from 4/3 to 83/36, approximately 1.333 to 2.305, so at integer δt, δt=2 only? δt is integer since turns are discrete.\n\nδt = T - t1, integer >=0.\n\nSo at δt=2: 48 - 36*2 = 48-72= -24 <=0, and 83-72=11 >=0, so yes.\n\nAt δt=1: 48-36=12 >0, so min=12>0, 0 not covered.\n\nAt δt=3: 48-108= -60 <=0, but 83-108= -25 <0, so max=-25<0, 0 not covered.\n\nSo only at δt=2, it covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (48,83,left,36), so same, unsafe only at δt=2.\n\nNow freeway 3: multiple cars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, span at δt: [τ + sδt, h + sδt]\n\nh=48, τ=37, s=12, d=right\n\nSpan: [37 + 12δt, 48 + 12δt]\n\nCovers 0 when 37 +12δt <=0 <=48 +12δt\n\nBut 37 +12δt <=0? 37 +12δt >=37>0 for δt>=0, so min >0, 0 not covered. Similarly, all positive, so never covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,12), h=12, τ=1, s=12, right\n\nSpan: [1 + 12δt, 12 + 12δt] all positive for δt>=0, min=1+12δt >=1>0, so never covers 0.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12), h=-24? τ=-35, s=12, right\n\nSpan: [τ + sδt, h + sδt] = [-35 +12δt, -24 +12δt]\n\nCovers 0 when -35 +12δt <=0 <= -24 +12δt\n\nFirst: -35 +12δt <=0 => 12δt <=35 => δt <= 35/12 ≈2.916\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +12δt => 12δt >=24 => δt >=2\n\nSo for δt from 2 to 35/12, 35/12=2.916, so integer δt=2 and δt=3? δt=2: min=-35+24= -11 <=0, max=-24+24=0 <=0? 0 <= max=0, so yes, covered.\n\nAt δt=2: min=-35+24= -11, max=-24+24=0, so 0 is included since max=0.\n\nSimilarly, δt=3: min=-35+36=1 >0? min=-35+36=1, max=-24+36=12, min=1>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nδt=2: min=-35+24= -11 <=0, max= -24+24=0, so 0 <= max=0, yes.\n\nδt=3: min=1, max=12, both >0, not cover.\n\nδt=1: min=-35+12= -23 <=0, max=-24+12= -12 <0, so max<0, 0 not covered.\n\nSo only at δt=2, this car covers x=0.\n\nBut for freeway 3, there are three cars, but the first two never cover 0, only the third one covers at δt=2.\n\nSo freeway 3 unsafe at δt=2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same cars as freeway 3? \"4 | (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) \"\n\nExactly same as freeway 3, so unsafe only at δt=2.\n\nFreeway 5: same, unsafe only at δt=2.\n\nNow freeway 6: only one car: (48,37,right,6)\n\nh=48, τ=37, s=6, right\n\nSpan: [37 +6δt, 48 +6δt] all positive for δt>=0, min=37+6δt >=37>0, so never covers 0. So freeway 6 always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: (48,37,right,6) same as above, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars: (48,37,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6) same, min=37+6δt >=37>0, never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6) h=0, τ=-11, s=6, right\n\nSpan: [τ + sδt, h + sδt] = [-11 +6δt, 0 +6δt] = [-11+6δt, 6δt]\n\nCovers 0 when -11+6δt <=0 <= 6δt\n\nFirst inequality: -11+6δt <=0 => 6δt <=11 => δt <= 11/6 ≈1.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= 6δt => δt >=0, always true for δt>=0.\n\nSo 0 <= 6δt is true, and -11+6δt <=0 for δt <= 11/6\n\nSince δt integer, δt=0,1\n\nAt δt=0: min=-11, max=0, so 0 covered.\n\nAt δt=1: min=-11+6= -5 <=0, max=6>=0, so covered.\n\nAt δt=2: min=-11+12=1>0, max=12>0, not covered.\n\nSo unsafe at δt=0 and δt=1.\n\nNow, δt=0 is turn t1, but at turn t1, we are at y=0, not on freeway, so for freeway 8, at δt=0, it is unsafe, but we are not on it, so no collision. Collision only if we are on the freeway at that turn.\n\nFor freeway 8, unsafe at δt=1 and δt=0, but δt=0 is turn t1, we are at y=0, so when we are on freeway 8 at some turn, we need to avoid when it is unsafe.\n\nSummary of unsafe times for each freeway:\n\ny=1: unsafe at δt=2\n\ny=2: unsafe at δt=2\n\ny=3: unsafe at δt=2\n\ny=4: unsafe at δt=2\n\ny=5: unsafe at δt=2\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: unsafe at δt=0 and δt=1, but δt=0 is now, irrelevant; unsafe at δt=1\n\nδt=1 is turn t1+1\n\nNow, we start at turn t1=56, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nMinimal H: if we go up every turn, we reach y=9 in 9 actions: from t1 to t1+8, y from 0 to 9.\n\nAt turn t1 + k, we are at y_k, for k=0 to 9? Let's index properly.\n\nAt turn T = t1 + δt, position y_T.\n\nAfter actions, but let's think in turns.\n\nAt turn t1 (δt=0), position y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, we move to y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nWe collide at turn T if at that turn, we are on freeway y_T, and that freeway is unsafe at δt = T - t1.\n\nFor example, at turn t1 (δt=0), we are at y=0, safe.\n\nAt turn t1+1 (δt=1), if we are on y=1 to 8, we need to check.\n\nNow, with going straight up:\n\nStart turn t1: y=0, safe.\n\nAction a_{t1}: say U, then at turn t1+1, y=1, δt=1.\n\nFreeway y=1: unsafe only at δt=2, so at δt=1, safe.\n\nThen action a_{t1+1}: U, turn t1+2, y=2, δt=2.\n\nFreeway y=2: unsafe at δt=2, so collision.\n\nCannot be on y=2 at δt=2.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=3 at δt=2, also unsafe.\n\ny=4,5 same.\n\ny=1 at δt=2 is safe, since unsafe only at δt=2 for y=1? y=1 unsafe at δt=2, so at δt=2, on y=1, collision.\n\ny=1 unsafe at δt=2, meaning at turn t1+2, if on y=1, collide.\n\nSimilarly for y=2,3,4,5 at δt=2.\n\ny=6 and y=7 always safe.\n\ny=8 unsafe at δt=1.\n\nIn straight up path:\n\nTurn | δt | y | freeway unsafe? | collision?\nt1   | 0  | 0 | safe, not freeway\na_t1: U\nt1+1 | 1  | 1 | y=1 unsafe only at δt=2, so at δt=1 safe\na_{t1+1}: U\nt1+2 | 2  | 2 | y=2 unsafe at δt=2, collide\n\nSo indeed, at turn t1+2, on y=2, δt=2, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=3 at t1+2, same issue.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on y=1,2,3,4,5 at δt=2.\n\ny=1 to 5 all unsafe at δt=2.\n\nWe can be on y=6 or y=7 at δt=2, which are safe.\n\nBut at turn t1+2, if we are on y=6 or y=7, that means we moved faster.\n\nStart at y=0 at t1.\n\nAfter one action at t1, to y=1 at t1+1.\n\nAfter two actions, at t1+2, y can be 0,1,2 depending on actions.\n\nAt turn t1+2, position y_{t1+2}.\n\nTo be at y=6 at t1+2, we need to go up 6 steps in 2 turns, impossible, since max +1 per turn, so y=2 max at t1+2.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 impossible.\n\nSo at turn t1+2, we must be on y=0,1, or 2.\n\ny=0: safe, but not freeway.\n\ny=1: unsafe at δt=2\n\ny=2: unsafe at δt=2\n\nSo if we are on y=1 or 2 at t1+2, we collide.\n\nIf we stay at y=0, but y=0 at t1+2.\n\nAt turn t1+2, if we are at y=0, we are not on any freeway, so no collision, but we need to move eventually.\n\nBut at δt=2, on y=0 safe.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, the problem is at δt=2, we cannot be on y=1 to 5.\n\nBut since we can only be on y=0,1,2 at that time, and y=1,2 are unsafe, so we must be on y=0 at turn t1+2 to avoid collision.\n\nThat means we need to stay at y=0 for the first two turns or something.\n\nLet's see actions.\n\nAt turn t1, we start at y=0.\n\nAction a_{t1}: if we do S, stay, then at turn t1+1, y=0.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, action a_{t1+1}: if we do S again, at turn t1+2, y=0.\n\nThen no collision at t1+2.\n\nThen we can start moving.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9.\n\nNow, y=8 is unsafe at δt=1.\n\nδt=1 is turn t1+1.\n\nAt turn t1+1, if we are on y=8, it would be unsafe, but at turn t1+1, since we start from y=0, we can only be at y=0 or y=1 at t1+1.\n\ny=8 impossible at t1+1.\n\nSo no issue with y=8 at δt=1.\n\nNow, the main issue is δt=2 for y=1-5.\n\nWe need to be not on y=1-5 at δt=2.\n\nAt δt=2, turn t1+2, we must be on y=0 to be safe.\n\nThen, from there, we need to go to y=9.\n\nNow, y=6 and y=7 are always safe, y=8 unsafe only at δt=1, but δt=1 is past, or future? δt relative to t1.\n\nt1+1 is δt=1, t1+2 is δt=2, etc.\n\ny=8 unsafe at δt=1, which is turn t1+1.\n\nBut at turn t1+1, we can only be at y=0 or y=1, so we are never on y=8 at δt=1, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly, for other times.\n\nNow, we also need to consider when we reach each y.\n\nSince we need to avoid being on unsafe freeways at certain times.\n\nSpecifically, for y=1 to 5, they are only unsafe at δt=2, so if we are on them at other times, safe.\n\ny=6 and 7 always safe.\n\ny=8 unsafe at δt=1, but as above, we can't be on it at δt=1, and at other times safe? Let's check.\n\ny=8 unsafe at δt=0 and δt=1, but δt=0 is t1, not on it; δt=1 is t1+1, not on it since y<=1; so for later times, δt>=2, y=8 is safe, since only unsafe at δt=0,1.\n\nFrom above, for y=8, unsafe at δt=0 and δt=1, safe for δt>=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 to 5 unsafe only at δt=2, safe at other times.\n\ny=6 and 7 always safe.\n\nNow, we start at y=0, t1.\n\nWe must be at y=0 at t1+2 to avoid collision.\n\nSo actions: at t1, we can do S or D, but D to y=-1? y in [0,9], so y=0, if D, y=0? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy: U +1, D -1, S 0, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if at y=0, D would try to go to -1, but clamped to 0? The dynamics: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if at y=0 and action D, y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) =0, similarly at y=9, U to 9.\n\nSo action D at y=0 stays at 0, similarly.\n\nSo at t1, if we do S or D, we stay at y=0 for next turn.\n\nSimilarly at other boundaries.\n\nNow, to be at y=0 at turn t1+2, we need:\n\nAt turn t1+1, we must be at y=0, because if at y=1 at t1+1, then at t1+2 we could go to y=0,1,2.\n\nBut at t1+2, we need y=0.\n\nSimilarly, at t1+1, if we are at y=0, we can stay or go to y=1 or down, but down stays.\n\nSo to have y_{t1+2} =0, we must have y_{t1+1} =0 and action S or D, or y_{t1+1}=1 and action D to y=0.\n\nBut at t1+1, if we are at y=1, and do D, to y=0 at t1+2.\n\nBut at turn t1+1, if we are at y=1, is it safe?\n\nAt turn t1+1, δt=1, y=1: freeway y=1 unsafe only at δt=2, so at δt=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 at δt=1 is safe.\n\nNow, for the path: we need to be at y=0 at turn t1+2.\n\nOptions:\n\n1. At t1, do S (or D, same as S), so at t1+1, y=0.\n\nThen at t1+1, do S (or D), so at t1+2, y=0.\n\n2. At t1, do U, so at t1+1, y=1.\n\nThen at t1+1, do D, so at t1+2, y=0.\n\nIn both cases, at t1+2, y=0.\n\nNow, from there, we need to go to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nNow, after t1+2, δt >=2.\n\nFor y=1 to 5, since δt>=2, and they are unsafe only at δt=2, so for δt>2, they are safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 safe for δt>=2.\n\ny=6,7 always safe.\n\nSo no more unsafe times, we can go straight up.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom turn t1+2, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal actions: 9 steps up, but we are at y=0 at t1+2, so after H-2 actions? Let's think.\n\nStart from turn t1+2, position y=0.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nEach up action increases y by 1, so minimal 9 actions to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nAfter k actions, y increases by net up, but since we go straight, 9 up actions.\n\nAt turn t1+2, we are at y=0.\n\nAfter first action, at turn t1+3, y=1, and so on.\n\nAfter 9 actions, at turn t1+2+9 = t1+11, y=9.\n\nBut H is the number of actions from t1.\n\nWe have actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H, y=9.\n\nCurrently at t1+2, y=0.\n\nTo go to y=9, we need to increase y by 9, so at least 9 actions.\n\nAfter 9 actions from t1+2, at turn (t1+2) +9 = t1+11, y=9.\n\nBut the actions: from a_{t1+2} to a_{t1+10}, 9 actions? Turns: at turn t1+2, before action, y=0.\n\nAction a_{t1+2}, then turn t1+3, y_{t1+3}, ..., after action a_{t1+10}, turn t1+11, y_{t1+11}.\n\nSet to 9.\n\nNow, the sequence includes actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nWe have actions at t1 and t1+1 to get to this point.\n\nIn the first part, we have actions at t1 and t1+1 to be at y=0 at t1+2.\n\nThen actions from t1+2 to t1+10 for 9 actions to reach y=9 at t1+11.\n\nSo total actions: from t1 to t1+10, that's 11 actions: t=0 to 10, 11 actions? Indices.\n\nActions: a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, a_{t1+2}, ..., a_{t1+10} for 11 actions.\n\nAt turn t1+11, y=9.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut minimal possible is 9, but we took 2 extra turns to wait.\n\nCan we do with less?\n\nPerhaps we don't need to be exactly at y=0 at t1+2.\n\nFor example, at t1+2, if we could be at y=6 or something, but impossible.\n\ny=6 at t1+2 requires going up 6 in 2 steps, not possible.\n\nMax y at t1+2 is 2.\n\nAnd y=2 at t1+2 is unsafe.\n\ny=1 at t1+2 unsafe.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nSo no choice, must be at y=0 at t1+2.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=6 or 7 at δt=2, but impossible.\n\nSo we must delay until after δt=2.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut in the go up phase, we need to make sure no collisions, but since after δt=2, all freeways are safe at all times except that y=8 was unsafe only at δt=1, which is past, so no issue.\n\ny=1 to 5 unsafe only at δt=2, so for δt>2 safe.\n\ny=8 unsafe at δt=0,1, safe for δt>=2.\n\ny=6,7 always safe.\n\nSo yes, from t1+2 onwards, we can go straight up without issue.\n\nNow, the actions.\n\nFirst, we need to have y=0 at turn t1+2.\n\nTwo options as before.\n\nOption A: at t1, do S (or D), so at t1+1, y=0.\n\nThen at t1+1, do S (or D), so at t1+2, y=0.\n\nOption B: at t1, do U, to y=1 at t1+1.\n\nThen at t1+1, do D, to y=0 at t1+2.\n\nIn option B, at t1+1, we are at y=1, δt=1, which is safe, as established.\n\nThen at t1+2, y=0.\n\nNow, in terms of number of actions, both take 2 actions to be at y=0 at t1+2.\n\nThen from there, 9 actions to y=9.\n\nTotal H=11 actions.\n\nBut in option B, we moved up then down, but ended at same point with same number of actions.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we can choose either.\n\nBut perhaps option A is simpler, just stay twice.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions.\n\nBut we need to output the actions starting from t1.\n\nAlso, for the go up part, from t1+2 to t1+10, all actions U.\n\nBut at y=9, if we go up, it stays, but we reach y=9 at turn t1+11 after the last action.\n\nNow, but let's confirm the turns.\n\nSet t1=56 for clarity.\n\nTurn 56: start y=0\n\nAction a56: if S, then turn 57, y=0\n\nAction a57: S, turn 58, y=0\n\nThen action a58: U, turn 59, y=1\n\na59: U, turn 60, y=2\n\na60: U, turn 61, y=3\n\na61: U, turn 62, y=4\n\na62: U, turn 63, y=5\n\na63: U, turn 64, y=6\n\na64: U, turn 65, y=7\n\na65: U, turn 66, y=8\n\na66: U, turn 67, y=9\n\nNow, at turn 67, y=9, reached.\n\nActions from a56 to a66, that's 11 actions: t=56 to 66.\n\nH=11.\n\nWith option B: a56: U, turn 57, y=1\n\nAt turn 57, δt=1, y=1, safe.\n\na57: D, turn 58, y=0\n\nThen same as above, a58 to a66 all U, to y=9 at turn 67.\n\nSame number.\n\nNow, but in option B, at turn 57, we are at y=1, which is fine.\n\nBut we need to check if at any point collision.\n\nIn the go up phase, after turn 58, δt=2 and above.\n\nFor example, at turn 59, δt=3 (since t1=56, T=59, δt=3)\n\ny=1 at δt=3: since y=1 unsafe only at δt=2, so at δt=3 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at turn 60, δt=4, safe, and so on.\n\ny=8 at turn 66, δt=10, which is >=2, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut can we reach faster?\n\nFor example, if we start going up later, but we are at y=0 at t1+2, and need to go to 9, minimal 9 steps.\n\nPerhaps we can go to higher y at t1+2, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: what if at t1+2, we are at y=0, but then we go up, but perhaps we can be on y=1 at δt=3, which is safe, etc.\n\nBut no need, since we have to go through all.\n\nBut in terms of H, 11 is minimal under the constraint.\n\nBut H=11 actions to reach in 11 turns? From start to end.\n\nAt turn t1, after 0 actions, position y=0.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1+H, position y=9.\n\nWith H=11, turn t1+11, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 67, y=9, t1=56, 56+11=67, yes.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose we do only 10 actions.\n\nThen at turn t1+10, y=9.\n\nBut from y=0 to y=9 in 10 actions, we need net +9, so possible only if we go up 9 times and one other action, but since we start from 0, to reach 9 in 10 actions, we must have exactly 9 up and one stay or down, but if we do down or stay, we don't reach y=9, or reach later.\n\nFor example, if we do 9 up and one down, y increases by 8, to y=8.\n\nIf 9 up and one stay, to y=9 but with one extra action, but with 10 actions, if we do 9 up and one stay, we reach y=9, but with 10 actions, which is more than minimal 9, but in this case we have constraint.\n\nBut here, to avoid collision, we need to be at y=0 at t1+2.\n\nWith H=10 actions, we need to reach y=9 at turn t1+10.\n\nAt turn t1+10, y=9.\n\nBut we must have been at y=0 at turn t1+2.\n\nTurn t1+2 to turn t1+10, that's 8 turns apart.\n\nFrom turn t1+2 to t1+10, that's 8 actions? Turns: at turn t1+2, position y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{t1+2}, turn t1+3, y= something, ..., after action a_{t1+9}, turn t1+10, y_{t1+10}.\n\nTo have y_{t1+10}=9, starting from y_{t1+2}=0, we need to increase y by 9 in 8 actions? 8 actions from a_{t1+2} to a_{t1+9}.\n\nAfter 8 actions, y from 0 to some value.\n\nWith 8 actions, maximum y increase is 8, to y=8, or if we go up all, y=8 at turn t1+10.\n\nBut we need y=9.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=0 in 8 actions, impossible, since +8 max.\n\nAfter 8 actions, y <= 8.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need at least 9 actions from y=0.\n\nThus, from t1+2, minimal 9 actions to reach y=9.\n\nThus total actions from t1: 2 to get to t1+2 at y=0, plus 9 to go to y=9, total 11.\n\nH=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we can use option A or B.\n\nPerhaps option A is simpler: stay twice then up all.\n\nIn option B, we go up then down, which might be unnecessary, but same H.\n\nNow, but in the answer, we need to specify actions.\n\nAlso, for the go up, all U.\n\nBut let's confirm if at any point we might be on unsafe freeway.\n\nIn the sequence above with option A:\n\nTurn 56 (t1, δt=0): y=0, safe\n\nAction: S\n\nTurn 57 (δt=1): y=0, safe (not freeway)\n\nAction: S\n\nTurn 58 (δt=2): y=0, safe\n\nAction: U\n\nTurn 59 (δt=3): y=1, freeway y=1, δt=3>2, safe\n\nAction: U\n\nTurn 60 (δt=4): y=2, safe\n\nU\n\nTurn 61 (δt=5): y=3, safe\n\nU\n\nTurn 62 (δt=6): y=4, safe\n\nU\n\nTurn 63 (δt=7): y=5, safe\n\nU\n\nTurn 64 (δt=8): y=6, safe\n\nU\n\nTurn 65 (δt=9): y=7, safe\n\nU\n\nTurn 66 (δt=10): y=8, freeway y=8, δt=10>=2, safe\n\nAction: U\n\nTurn 67 (δt=11): y=9, reached, no action needed? But the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H, we are at position.\n\nIn this case, at turn 66, action U, to y=9 at turn 67.\n\nNow, with option B:\n\nTurn 56: y=0, action U\n\nTurn 57: y=1, δt=1, y=1 safe, action D\n\nTurn 58: y=0, δt=2, safe\n\nThen same as before.\n\nNow, both work.\n\nPerhaps we can start going up earlier but avoid the collision.\n\nFor example, at t1, go up to y=1 at t1+1.\n\nThen at t1+1, instead of going down, we stay or go up, but if at t1+1 we go up to y=2 at t1+2, then collide.\n\nIf at t1+1 we stay at y=1, then at t1+2 y=1, but y=1 unsafe at δt=2, collide.\n\nSo must go down to y=0 at t1+2.\n\nNo other way.\n\nPerhaps go to y=0 at t1+2, but then go up faster, but cannot, since each step +1.\n\nSo H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need the sequence.\n\nIn the output, it should be actions for turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nWith H=11, actions from t1 to t1+10.\n\nIn the sequence, for option A: all actions except first two S, then all U.\n\nFirst two S, then nine U.\n\nIn my earlier, from a58 to a66, that's 9 U: a58 to a66 is 9 actions? Turns: a58,a59,a60,a61,a62,a63,a64,a65,a66: that's 9 actions, from turn 58 to 66, positions from y=1 to y=9 at turn 67.\n\nActions: a56: S, a57: S, a58: U, a59: U, ..., a66: U.\n\na56 and a57 are S, then a58 to a66: 9 U.\n\na58 to a66 inclusive is 9 actions? a58, a59, a60, a61, a62, a63, a64, a65, a66: that's 9 actions, yes.\n\nThen at turn 67, y=9.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 6,7,8, we have cars, but we said they are safe when we pass.\n\nFor example, at turn 64, y=6, δt=8, freeway y=6 always safe, yes.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut in freeway 8, there was a car at (0,-11,right,6), which is unsafe at δt=0,1, but at δt=8, safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, with option A or B.\n\nPerhaps we can do with H=10 if we reach earlier, but not possible.\n\nAnother thought: what if we go down at some point? But that would take more actions, worse.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=0 and stay, but we are already at y=0.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nSo minimal H=11.\n\nNow, for the sequence, let's use option A: stay twice then up.\n\nBut in the action, at y=0, S and D both do nothing, but we can use S.\n\nNow, in the answer, we need to output for each turn.\n\nAlso, the player position changes.\n\nIn the sequence, actions.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1} = S\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1} = S\n\nThen Turn t1+2: a_{t1+2} = U\n\nTurn t1+3: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t1+10: U\n\nt1+10 is the last action.\n\nH=11 actions, from t=0 to 10, so turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+10.\n\nAfter a_{t1+10}, at turn t1+11, y=9.\n\nNow, the actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+10}.\n\nWith: a_{t1} = S, a_{t1+1} = S, and a_{t1+2} to a_{t1+10} = U.\n\na_{t1+2} to a_{t1+10} is 9 actions, all U.\n\nYes.\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nBut in the format, it should be like:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 + 10: a_{t_1 + 10}\n\nWith actions.\n\nSince t1=56, but in answer, we use t1.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 3,4,5, there were cars, but we only care about x=0 coverage.\n\nIn freeway 8, the car (0,-11,right,6) at δt=0 and 1 covers x=0, but we are not on it.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=8 at turn 66, δt=10, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps we can go up faster to y=6 or something, but cannot.\n\nAnother idea: what if at t1, we do nothing, but then at t1+1, we go up, but at t1+2 we need to be at y=0.\n\nIf at t1, S, t1+1 y=0, then at t1+1, if we do U, to y=1 at t1+2, but then at t1+2 y=1, unsafe.\n\nSo must do S at t1+1 to stay at 0.\n\nOr do D, same.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut in the output, it should be minimal H, but we output the sequence, and H is implied.\n\nIn the box, we write the actions.\n\nNow, let's write it.\n\nFirst, H=11.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t_1: S\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: S\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 4: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 5: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 6: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 7: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 8: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 9: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 10: U\n\nAfter that, at turn t_1 + 11, position (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, Turn t_1 + 10: U to reach y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nWe can use option B, but S and S is fine.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 6,7,8, we have cars, but since we pass at safe times, no issue.\n\nBut let's confirm freeway 6: only one car, (48,37,right,6), which never covers x=0, since min x=37+6δt >=37>0.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7 same.\n\nFreeway 8: first car same, never covers 0; second car (0,-11,right,6) covers at δt=0,1, but at δt=10, not covered.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps we can start going up at t1, but then must come back down.\n\nBut same H.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nThus, the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 56\\) is 11. This requires waiting at \\(y = 0\\) for the first two turns to avoid the collision risk at \\(\\delta t = 2\\) (turn \\(t_1 + 2\\)) on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\), which are unsafe at that time. After \\(\\delta t = 2\\), all freeways are safe for traversal, allowing a direct upward path to \\(y = 9\\) with no further delays.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- At turn \\(t_1\\), stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\).\n- At turn \\(t_1 + 1\\), stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\).\n- From turns \\(t_1 + 2\\) to \\(t_1 + 10\\), move up (U) each turn to increase \\(y\\) by 1 per turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + 11\\).\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions:\n- At turn \\(t_1\\) (\\(\\delta t = 0\\)), \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no freeway).\n- At turn \\(t_1 + 1\\) (\\(\\delta t = 1\\)), \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no freeway).\n- At turn \\(t_1 + 2\\) (\\(\\delta t = 2\\)), \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no freeway; avoids unsafe freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\)).\n- For turns \\(t_1 + 3\\) to \\(t_1 + 10\\) (\\(\\delta t = 3\\) to \\(10\\)), the player is on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), all of which are safe at these times since:\n  - \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\) are unsafe only at \\(\\delta t = 2\\).\n  - \\(y = 6\\) and \\(y = 7\\) are always safe.\n  - \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe only at \\(\\delta t = 0\\) and \\(\\delta t = 1\\), safe for \\(\\delta t \\geq 2\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } t_1:  S \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 1:  S \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 2:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 3:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 4:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 5:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 6:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 7:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 8:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 9:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 10:  U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

I should aim to go up as much as possible.\n\nNow, about the cars: for each freeway, there are cars moving left or right at given speeds. The car positions are given at turn t_1=58, and for future turns, we calculate their spans based on the direction and speed.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8), and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span of that car at that turn. 0 here refers to the x-position, I think, since the player is always at x=0.\n\nThe player is always at (0, y_t), so the x-position is fixed at 0. So collision happens if y_t is between 1 and 8, and at that turn, there is a car on that row whose span includes x=0.\n\nAlso, important: when the player moves, at turn T, if they move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, they are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, only at T+1. So for collision, we only care about the row we're on at the start of the turn, I think. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the player's position at turn T. So at turn T, the player is on row y_T, and we check if at that turn, for that row, x=0 is covered by a car span.\n\nThen, if the player moves, say at turn T they are on y_T, and they choose an action to go to y_{T+1}. At turn T, they are still on y_T, so collision is checked for row y_T at time T. When they arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, then at turn T+1, they are on y_{T+1}, so collision is checked for row y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", which means at turn T, you are on y_T, and at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nSo for collision, at each turn, we only care about the row we're currently on at that turn.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at t=58. y=0 is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8. So at y=0, there are no cars, so no collision possible. Similarly, at y=9, no cars, so once we reach y=9, we're safe.\n\nWe need to get to y=9, which is the top row, no cars.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 9, since we need to move up 9 units, and each U moves up by 1, so minimum 9 turns if we can go straight up without stopping.\n\nBut we might need to stop or something to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's list the car positions for each freeway at turn t=58.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (head=48, tail=83, direction=left, speed=36)\n\nSince it's left-moving, head and tail: at t=58, span is [h, τ] = [48, 83]? But direction left, so for left-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" and then moves left.\n\nIn the update: for left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nNow, for freeway 1: head=48, tail=83, left, speed=36.\n\nBut head and tail: for left-moving, it says \"head at h, tail at τ\", and span is [h, τ]. But if it's moving left, and head is at 48, tail at 83, that would imply tail is to the right if 83>48, but moving left, so the car is from left to right? I think I need to interpret the coordinates.\n\nAssume x-axis, increasing to the right. So for a left-moving car, it should have decreasing x. So if head is at h and tail at τ, with h and τ, but in the span [h, τ], if h < τ, then it's from left to right, but moving left? That might be inconsistent.\n\nLook at the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nIf the car is moving left, and at t_1, head is at h, tail at τ. If h < τ, then head is left, tail right, so as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so if τ and h, with τ < h, then τ is left, h is right, moving right.\n\nIn freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36). So head=48, tail=83, since 48<83, so head left at 48, tail right at 83, span [48,83], moving left at speed 36.\n\nAt time T, span is [48 - 36(T-58), 83 - 36(T-58)]\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1, (48,83,left,36)\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving cars, span is given as [τ, h]? No, in the state, it's listed as (head, tail, dir, speed), but for right-moving, in the update, it uses [τ, h] for the span at t_1.\n\nIn the car state table, for freeway 3, it says: (48,37,right,12), etc.\n\nFor a right-moving car, head and tail: since it's moving right, head should be the front, so if moving right, head has higher x if x increases right.\n\nIn the update for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" and \"→ Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\"\n\nSo [τ, h] with τ and h, and since it's moving right, τ should be the left end, h the right end.\n\nIn the input, for freeway 3, car 1: (48,37,right,12)\n\nBut 48 and 37, if τ and h, but it's written as (head, tail), so for right-moving, head should be the front, so higher x, tail lower x.\n\nHere head=48, tail=37, so 48>37, so head at 48, tail at 37, so span [τ, h] = [37,48] since τ is tail, h is head.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,12), head=12, tail=1, so span [1,12]\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12), head=-24, tail=-35? -24 > -35, so head at -24, tail at -35, span [-35,-24]\n\nAll right-moving at speed 12.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4 and 5: same as freeway 3, three cars each.\n\nFreeway 4: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: one car (48,37,right,6), so head=48, tail=37, right, speed 6, span [37,48] at t=58.\n\nFreeway 7: same as 6, (48,37,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: two cars, (48,37,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, right, speed 6, span [37,48]\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, right, speed 6, span [-11,0]\n\nAt t=58, span [-11,0] for this car.\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,0) at t=58. Since y=0, no car, safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, moving up.\n\nEach move U increases y by 1, D decreases, S stays.\n\nTo minimize turns, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions on rows 1 to 8.\n\nAt each turn, when on a row between 1 and 8, we need that at that time, no car on that row has span covering x=0.\n\nSince we move one row at a time, we need to plan the sequence.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row, at what times x=0 is covered by a car, so that we cannot be on that row at that time.\n\nFor each freeway k, we need to find when 0 is in Span(T) for some car on that freeway.\n\nThen, for row k, we have a set of times T where it is occupied at x=0.\n\nThen, when the player is on row k at time T, it must be that T is not in that set for row k.\n\nSince we move sequentially, we can think of the path.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each row the times when it is blocked, i.e., some car covers x=0.\n\nStart with row 1.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, left-moving, span at T: [48 - 36(T-58), 83 - 36(T-58)]\n\n0 is in span if 48 - 36(Δt) ≤ 0 ≤ 83 - 36(Δt), where Δt = T - 58\n\nSo 48 - 36Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 83 - 36Δt\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36Δt ≤ 0 => 36Δt ≥ 48 => Δt ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 83 - 36Δt => 36Δt ≤ 83 => Δt ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSo Δt from ceil(1.333) to floor(2.305), but since Δt integer, Δt=2? Let's see.\n\nΔt ≥ 4/3 ≈1.333, so since Δt integer, Δt ≥ 2? 4/3=1.333, so Δt >= 2 since 1.333, ceil to 2? No.\n\nΔt must satisfy both inequalities.\n\n48 - 36Δt ≤ 0 => Δt ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 = 1.333, so since Δt integer, Δt >= 2? Δt=1: 48-36(1)=12 >0, not <=0. Δt=2: 48-72= -24 <=0, yes.\n\n0 ≤ 83 - 36Δt: Δt <= 83/36 ≈2.305, so Δt <=2 since Δt integer.\n\nSo Δt <=2 and Δt >=2, so Δt=2.\n\nThus at T=58 + Δt = 58+2=60, 0 is in span.\n\nAt Δt=2, span: [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11], and 0 is between -24 and 11, yes.\n\nAt Δt=1, T=59: [48-36, 83-36] = [12,47], 0 not in [12,47]\n\nAt Δt=3, T=61: [48-108, 83-108] = [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=60, row 1 is blocked.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (48,83,left,36), so same, only blocked at T=60.\n\nNow row 3.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) but for right-moving, span at t_1: [τ, h] = [37,48] since tail=37, head=48.\n\nAt T, span [37 + 12(Δt), 48 + 12(Δt)]\n\n0 in span if 37 +12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 48 +12Δt\n\nBut 37+12Δt ≤0? 37+12Δt >=37>0 for Δt>=0, so 37+12Δt >0, never <=0, so 0 cannot be <= lower bound since lower bound min at Δt=0 is 37>0. So 0 not in span for this car ever, because the car is at x>=37.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,12), span at t_1: [τ,h] = [1,12]\n\nAt T: [1 +12Δt, 12 +12Δt]\n\n0 in span if 1+12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 12+12Δt\n\n1+12Δt ≤0? 1+12Δt >=1>0, never <=0, so impossible. Car at x>=1, so for x=0, not covered.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12) head=-24, tail=-35, so τ=tail=-35, h=head=-24, span [τ,h] = [-35,-24]\n\nAt T: [-35 +12Δt, -24 +12Δt]\n\n0 in span if -35+12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -24+12Δt\n\nFirst: -35+12Δt ≤0 => 12Δt ≤35 => Δt ≤ 35/12 ≈2.916\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -24+12Δt => 12Δt ≥24 => Δt ≥2\n\nSo Δt >=2 and Δt <=2.916, so Δt=2 or Δt=3? Δt integer.\n\nΔt=2: -35+24= -11 ≤0, 0 ≤ -24+24=0, 0<=0 true? 0 ≤ 0 is true, so yes.\n\nAt Δt=2, lower bound -35+24= -11, upper -24+24=0, so span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt Δt=3: lower -35+36=1, upper -24+36=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nAt Δt=1: lower -35+12=-23, upper -24+12=-12, span [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at Δt=2, T=60, 0 in span for third car.\n\nThus for row 3, at T=60, blocked by this car.\n\nNow, are there other cars? First two cars don't cover x=0, so only blocked at T=60.\n\nBut at T=60, the third car covers x=0.\n\nNow row 4: same as row 3, since cars identical, so also blocked only at T=60.\n\nSimilarly row 5: same, blocked at T=60.\n\nNow row 6.\n\nFreeway 6: one car (48,37,right,6), head=48, tail=37, so span [τ,h] = [37,48] at t_1.\n\nAt T: [37 +6Δt, 48 +6Δt]\n\nSince min x=37>0, never covers x=0. So row 6 never blocked.\n\nSimilarly, row 7: same as row 6, (48,37,right,6), never covers x=0, so always safe.\n\nNow row 8.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6), same as above, [37,48] to [37+6Δt,48+6Δt], never covers x=0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6), head=0, tail=-11.\n\nFor right-moving, span [τ,h] = [-11,0] at t_1? Tail=-11, head=0, so τ=tail=-11, h=head=0, span [τ,h] = [-11,0]\n\nAt T: [ -11 +6Δt, 0 +6Δt ] = [ -11 +6Δt, 6Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -11+6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 6Δt\n\nFirst: -11+6Δt ≤0 => 6Δt ≤11 => Δt ≤ 11/6 ≈1.833\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 6Δt => Δt ≥0, always true for Δt>=0.\n\nAlso, since Δt integer, Δt <=1.833, so Δt=0 or Δt=1.\n\nAt Δt=0, T=58: span [-11,0], 0 in span.\n\nAt Δt=1, T=59: [ -11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6], 0 in span.\n\nAt Δt=2, T=60: [ -11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo row 8 is blocked at T=58 and T=59.\n\nNow, summarize for each row, the times when it is blocked (x=0 covered):\n\n- Row 1: blocked at T=60\n\n- Row 2: blocked at T=60\n\n- Row 3: blocked at T=60\n\n- Row 4: blocked at T=60\n\n- Row 5: blocked at T=60\n\n- Row 6: never blocked\n\n- Row 7: never blocked\n\n- Row 8: blocked at T=58 and T=59\n\nT=58 and 59 for row 8.\n\nPlayer starts at t=58, y=0.\n\nAt t=58, y=0, no issue.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nEach move U increases y by 1.\n\nSince rows 6 and 7 are always safe, we can be there anytime.\n\nRows 1-5 are only blocked at T=60, so at other times, they are safe.\n\nRow 8 is blocked at T=58 and 59, safe at T=60 and later? At T=60, row 8 is safe, as we saw, since at T=60, span [1,12], 0 not covered.\n\nBut row 8 blocked only at T=58 and T=59.\n\nNow, the player must traverse rows 1 to 8, starting from y=0 at t=58.\n\nWe need to be on each row at some turn, but since we can stay or move, we might skip some or stay multiple turns, but to minimize time, we want to move up as much as possible.\n\nSince we start at t=58, and need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nNow, the critical point is that rows 1-5 are all blocked at T=60, so we cannot be on rows 1-5 at T=60.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 is blocked at T=58 and T=59, so we cannot be on row 8 at t=58 or t=59.\n\nBut at t=58, we are at y=0, not row 8.\n\nNow, let's think about the sequence.\n\nWe start at t=58, y=0.\n\nAt t=58, we choose an action: U, D, or S.\n\nSince we want to go up, D is useless, so probably U or S.\n\nIf we go U at t=58, then at t=59, we are at y=1.\n\nBut row 1 is only blocked at t=60, so at t=59, row 1 should be safe? Let's check.\n\nRow 1: blocked only at t=60, so at t=59, row 1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 blocked at t=58 and t=59, so at t=59, row 8 is blocked.\n\nBut at t=59, if we are on row 1, it's safe.\n\nNow, we need to avoid being on row 1 to 5 at t=60.\n\nAlso, row 8 at t=58 and t=59.\n\nNow, possible to go directly up.\n\nSuppose we go up every turn.\n\nStart t=58, y=0, action U: to y=1 at t=59.\n\nAt t=59, y=1, which is row 1. Now, row 1 at t=59: is it blocked? From above, row 1 only blocked at t=60, not at t=59, so safe. So we can be there.\n\nThen at t=59, action U: to y=2 at t=60.\n\nBut at t=60, y=2, row 2 is blocked at t=60! Oh, collision.\n\nCannot be on row 2 at t=60.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=1 at t=59, then to y=2 at t=60, but y=2 at t=60 is blocked.\n\nIf we stay at t=58: action S, then at t=59, still y=0.\n\nThen at t=59, action U to y=1 at t=60, but at t=60, y=1, row 1 is blocked at t=60, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAction U at t=58 to y=1 at t=59.\n\nThen at t=59, instead of U, we could do S or D.\n\nBut D down to y=0, which is safe, but we lose progress.\n\nOr S, stay at y=1.\n\nBut at t=59, y=1 is safe, as above.\n\nThen at t=60, if we are still at y=1, row 1 blocked at t=60, collision.\n\nSo if we are on row 1 at t=60, bad.\n\nSimilarly for rows 2-5.\n\nSo we need to not be on rows 1-5 at t=60.\n\nAlso, row 8, we cannot be on it at t=58 or t=59.\n\nNow, since rows 6 and 7 are always safe, we can be there anytime.\n\nWe need to time the movement so that at t=60, we are not on rows 1-5.\n\nPossible positions: y=0, or y=6,7,8,9.\n\ny=0 is safe, y=9 safe, y=6,7 safe.\n\ny=8: at t=60, row 8 is safe, since only blocked at 58 and 59.\n\nAt t=60, row 8 safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=61, etc.\n\nNow, back to the player.\n\nWe start at t=58, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: if no obstacles, 9 moves up.\n\nBut with obstacles, might take more if we need to wait.\n\nSince rows 1-5 blocked only at t=60, we can be on them before or after, but not at t=60.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 blocked at t=58 and 59, so we can be on it at t=60 or later.\n\nNow, let's list possible actions.\n\nOption: at t=58, go U to y=1 at t=59.\n\nThen at t=59, we are at y=1, which is safe since not blocked at t=59.\n\nNow, at t=59, we need to do something. If we go U to y=2 at t=60, but t=60 y=2 blocked.\n\nIf we go S, stay at y=1, then at t=60 y=1 blocked.\n\nIf we go D, to y=0 at t=60, y=0 is safe, but we are back to start.\n\nNot progress.\n\nSo from y=1 at t=59, we cannot go to row 2-5 at t=60, and row 1 at t=60 blocked, so we must leave row 1 before t=60, but at t=59, we are on row 1, and t=60 is next turn.\n\nActions at t=59 affect position at t=60.\n\nAt time t, we are at y_t, choose action for t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, and after action, at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision checked at each turn for y_t at time t.\n\nAt t=59, we are at y_{59}, and collision for row y_{59} at time t=59.\n\nSimilarly at t=60, for y_{60} at time t=60.\n\nSo back to t=58: at t=58, y=0, safe.\n\nAction: suppose U, then at t=59, y=1, and row 1 at t=59 is safe (not blocked).\n\nNow at t=59, we are at y=1, need to choose action for t=59.\n\nIf we choose U, then at t=60, y=2, and row 2 at t=60 is blocked, collision.\n\nIf we choose S, at t=60, y=1, row 1 at t=60 blocked, collision.\n\nIf we choose D, at t=60, y=0, row 0 safe, no collision, but y=0, no progress.\n\nSo from t=59 y=1, all actions lead to problem: if U or S, collision at t=60, if D, back to start.\n\nThus, it seems we cannot be on row 1 at t=59, because from there, we are forced to be on a bad position at t=60.\n\nAt t=59, if on row 1, then at t=60, whatever we do:\n\n- If U, to row 2 at t=60, blocked\n\n- If S, to row 1 at t=60, blocked\n\n- If D, to row 0 at t=60, safe but regress\n\nSo indeed, if at t=59 we are on row 1, we cannot avoid collision or regression at t=60.\n\nTherefore, we should not be on row 1 at t=59.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows, but row 1 is the first.\n\nPerhaps we should not move up at t=58.\n\nAt t=58, if we do S, stay at y=0.\n\nThen at t=59, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=59, we can choose action.\n\nIf we go U to y=1 at t=60, but row 1 at t=60 blocked, collision.\n\nIf we go S, stay at y=0 at t=60, safe but no progress.\n\nIf we go D, to y=-1, but y must be in [0,9], so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so if y=0, D not possible, since y=-1 invalid. Similarly, at y=0, only U or S possible, not D.\n\nAt y=0, action D would make y=-1, not allowed, so only U or S.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, only D or S.\n\nSo at t=58, y=0, actions: U or S.\n\nIf S at t=58, to y=0 at t=59.\n\nThen at t=59, y=0, actions: U or S.\n\nIf U at t=59, to y=1 at t=60, but row 1 blocked at t=60, collision.\n\nIf S at t=59, to y=0 at t=60, safe but no progress.\n\nSo we are stuck at y=0 if we don't move, but we need to move eventually.\n\nWe need to delay the movement so that we are not on rows 1-5 at t=60.\n\nSince t=60 is the only critical time for rows 1-5, we can be on them before or after.\n\nBut we start at t=58, so before t=60 is only t=58 and t=59.\n\nAt t=58, we are at y=0.\n\nAt t=59, we can be at y=0 or y=1, but if at y=1, we have problem as above.\n\nIf at t=59, we are at y=0, then at t=60, if we go to y=1, blocked.\n\nSo we must not be on rows 1-5 at t=60, so at t=60, we should be on y=0, or y=6,7,8,9.\n\ny=9 is far, not yet.\n\ny=6 or 7, we need to get there.\n\nBut rows 6 and 7 are always safe, so we can be there at any time.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 safe after t=59.\n\nNow, to reach row 6, we need to go through lower rows.\n\nSince we can move multiple steps, but each move takes a turn.\n\nAnother idea: at t=58, we stay or move, but to avoid being on low rows at t=60, we can move to higher rows quickly, but we can only move one step per turn.\n\nFor example, if we could jump to row 6 at t=59, but we can't, only move to adjacent rows.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo from y=0 at t=58, after one action, at t=59, y=0 or 1.\n\nAfter two actions, at t=60, y=0,1, or 2, depending on actions.\n\nBut at t=60, we cannot be on y=1 or 2, since rows 1 and 2 blocked, similarly y=3,4,5 blocked.\n\ny=0 is safe, y=6 not reachable yet.\n\nSo at t=60, the only safe y is 0, or possibly 6 but not reachable from y=0 in two steps.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=58, after two moves:\n\n- If U at 58 and U at 59: y=2 at t=60\n\n- U at 58, S at 59: y=1 at t=60\n\n- U at 58, D at 59: but at y=1, D to y=0 at t=60\n\n- S at 58, U at 59: y=1 at t=60\n\n- S at 58, S at 59: y=0 at t=60\n\n- S at 58, D at 59: not possible, y=0 cannot D\n\n- D at 58: not possible, y=0 cannot D\n\nSo possible positions at t=60: y=0,1,2\n\nBut y=1 and 2 are blocked at t=60, only y=0 is safe.\n\nSo at t=60, we must be at y=0 to avoid collision.\n\nThen at t=60, we are at y=0.\n\nThen we can start moving up after t=60.\n\nBut at t=60, rows 1-5 are blocked, but after t=60, they are safe, since only blocked at t=60.\n\nFor example, row 1: only blocked at t=60, before and after safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo after t=60, we can move up freely through rows 1-5.\n\nAlso, row 8 is safe after t=59, so at t=60 and later, safe.\n\nNow, from t=60, we are at y=0.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, so from y=0 to y=9, 9 moves, at turn t=61 to t=69, for example.\n\nStart from t=60 y=0.\n\nAt t=60, y=0, safe.\n\nAction U at t=60: to y=1 at t=61.\n\nAt t=61, y=1, row 1 at t=61: is it blocked? Row 1 only blocked at t=60, not at t=61, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, U at t=61 to y=2 at t=62, safe, and so on.\n\nBut row 8: at t=60 and later, safe, as we saw.\n\nAlso, rows 6 and 7 always safe.\n\nSo we can go directly up from t=60 onwards.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, total turns: from t=58 to t=60, we are at y=0 for three turns? Let's see the sequence.\n\nFirst, to be at y=0 at t=60, we need to not move up before.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=58: start y=0, action S (stay), so at t=59, y=0\n\nt=59: action S (stay), at t=60, y=0\n\nThen at t=60, y=0, action U, to y=1 at t=61\n\nt=61: action U, to y=2 at t=62\n\n...\n\nup to y=9.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9, 9 moves, so from t=60 to t=68, we go to y=9 at t=69? Let's index.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAt t=60, y=0\n\nAfter action at t=60: U, then at t=61, y=1\n\nAction at t=61: U, at t=62, y=2\n\n...\n\nAction at t=68: U, at t=69, y=9\n\nSince from y=0 to y=9, 9 steps, so y=9 at t=69.\n\nBut is that minimal? We wasted two turns at y=0.\n\nAt t=58 and t=59, we did nothing.\n\nPerhaps we can be on other rows at t=60.\n\nFor example, if we can reach row 6 or 7 at t=60, but from y=0 at t=58, to y=6 at t=60, impossible, since only two moves, max y=2.\n\ny=7 or 8 even farther.\n\nSo impossible to be on row 6-8 at t=60 from start.\n\nThus, only possibility at t=60 is y=0.\n\nThen we must stay at y=0 until t=60.\n\nNow, total time to reach y=9: from t=60 y=0, to y=9 at t=69, as above.\n\nH is the number of turns from t_1 to the turn when we reach y=9.\n\nt_1 = 58.\n\nWe reach y=9 at t=69.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=58 to t=68, 11 actions? Let's see.\n\nTurns: t=58,59,60,61,...,68.\n\nAt each turn, we take an action.\n\nAt t=58: action, to position at t=59\n\n...\n\nAt t=68: action, to position at t=69.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9, where t_1=58.\n\nThe position after H-1 actions.\n\nDefine: at turn t, we take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nStart: at turn t=58, position y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{58}, y_{59} = y_{58} + Δy\n\nSimilarly, after a_{59}, y_{60}, and so on.\n\nWe want y_{58 + H} =9 for some H? No.\n\nThe turn when we are at (0,9).\n\nWe are at position at turn T after actions.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nWe start at turn t=58, y_{58}=0.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T.\n\nThe minimal T such that y_T=9.\n\nThen H = T - 58 + 1? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe actions are taken from turn t to t+H-1, and at turn t+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nSet t_1 =58.\n\nSo actions: a_{58}, a_{59}, ..., a_{58 + H - 1}\n\nAnd y_{58 + H - 1} =9\n\nAt turn 58 + H - 1, we are at position (0,9).\n\nNow, how we get there.\n\nStart at turn 58, y=0.\n\nAfter a_{58}, y_{59} = y_{58} + Δy_{58}\n\nAfter a_{59}, y_{60} = y_{59} + Δy_{59}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{58 + H - 2}, y_{58 + H - 1} = y_{58 + H - 2} + Δy_{58 + H - 2}\n\nAnd at turn 58 + H - 1, y=9.\n\ny_{58 + H - 1} =9.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of actions.\n\nIn the case where we stay at y=0 until t=60.\n\nAt t=58: we need to choose a_{58}\n\nTo be at y=0 at t=60, we need y_{60}=0.\n\ny_{60} depends on actions from t=58 and t=59.\n\ny_{59} = y_{58} + Δy_{58} = 0 + Δy_{58}\n\nThen y_{60} = y_{59} + Δy_{59} = (0 + Δy_{58}) + Δy_{59}\n\nSet y_{60} =0, so Δy_{58} + Δy_{59} =0\n\nSince y_{58}=0.\n\nΔy is +1, -1, or 0 for U,D,S.\n\nBut at y=0, D not possible, so Δy_{58} can be 0 or +1 (S or U)\n\nSimilarly for Δy_{59}.\n\nIf Δy_{58} =0 (S), then y_{59}=0\n\nThen y_{60} = y_{59} + Δy_{59} = 0 + Δy_{59}\n\nIf Δy_{59}=0 (S), y_{60}=0\n\nIf Δy_{59}=1 (U), y_{60}=1, but we want y_{60}=0, so must have Δy_{59}=0.\n\nIf Δy_{58}=1 (U), y_{59}=1\n\nThen y_{60} = y_{59} + Δy_{59} =1 + Δy_{59}\n\nSet to 0, so 1 + Δy_{59} =0, thus Δy_{59} = -1 (D), but at y=1, D is possible to y=0.\n\nThen y_{60}=0.\n\nBut in this case, we moved to y=1 and back, which takes two turns to stay at y=0 effectively, same as staying.\n\nBut with the cost of two actions.\n\nNow, for y_{60}=0, we can have:\n\n- a_{58}=S, a_{59}=S: then y_{59}=0, y_{60}=0\n\n- a_{58}=U, a_{59}=D: y_{59}=1, y_{60}=0\n\nIn both cases, at t=60, y=0.\n\nThen from there, we go up.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, from y=0 at t=60, we need 9 up moves.\n\nEach up move increases y by 1, so after k up moves, y increases by k.\n\nBut we can have stay actions, but that would increase H, so to minimize H, we should not stay, only move up when possible.\n\nFrom t=60, y=0.\n\nAction at t=60: U, to y=1 at t=61\n\nAction at t=61: U, to y=2 at t=62\n\n...\n\nUp to action at t=68: U, to y=9 at t=69\n\nAt t=69, y=9.\n\nNow, the turn when y=9 is t=69.\n\nt_1 =58, so T=69.\n\nH such that y_{58 + H -1} =9\n\n58 + H -1 =69, so H-1 =11, H=12.\n\nActions from a_{58} to a_{58 + H -1} = a_{58} to a_{69}? Index.\n\nActions: t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{58} to a_{58 + H -1}\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{58 + H -1} =9\n\nSet 58 + H -1 =69, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nThen actions a_{58} to a_{69}, but a_{69} is action at turn 69, which determines y_{70}, but we want y_{69}=9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nDefine clearly.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T.\n\nWe take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nSo for turns T = t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H - 1, we take actions a_T.\n\nAfter taking a_{t_1 + H -1}, we have y_{t_1 + H} = y_{t_1} + sum of Δy from t=t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nBut we want the position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be (0,9), so y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y_{t_1 + H -1} before taking action? No.\n\nAt the beginning of turn T, we are at position y_T, then we take action a_T, which moves us to y_{T+1}.\n\nThe collision is checked at the beginning of the turn, before action, I think.\n\nThe problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nSo at turn T, we are at y_T, and collision checked based on that.\n\nThen we take action a_T, go to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nFor turn T, position y_T.\n\nWe want at some turn, y_T =9.\n\nIn the sequence, we take actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, meaning a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAfter taking a_{t_1 + H -1}, we are at y_{t_1 + H}, but we don't care, as long as at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at (0,9).\n\nSo for example, to be at y=9 at turn T.\n\nStart at t=58, y=0.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need net +9 in y, so at least 9 up moves.\n\nEach up move takes one turn, but we might have stays or down moves, which increase turns.\n\nMinimal H: if no stops, H=9, but we have to avoid the collision times.\n\nIn this case, with the block at t=60, we need to be at y=0 or safe row at t=60.\n\nSince only y=0 possible at t=60, we must have y_{60}=0.\n\nThen from t=60, y=0, to y=9, we need 9 turns to go up, so at turn t=69, y=9.\n\nt=69 is t_1 + 11, since 58 +11=69.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =69\n\n58 + H -1 =69, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nNow, the actions: from t=58 to t=68? Actions from t=58 to t=68, for H=11 actions? Let's list.\n\nTo have y_{60}=0.\n\ny_{60} = y_{58} + Δy_{58} + Δy_{59} , since y_{59} = y_{58} + Δy_{58}, y_{60} = y_{59} + Δy_{59} = y_{58} + Δy_{58} + Δy_{59}\n\ny_{58}=0, so y_{60} = Δy_{58} + Δy_{59}\n\nSet y_{60}=0, so Δy_{58} + Δy_{59} =0\n\nOptions:\n\n- Δy_{58}=0 (S), Δy_{59}=0 (S)\n\n- Δy_{58}=1 (U), Δy_{59}=-1 (D)\n\nThen y_{60}=0\n\nThen from t=60, we go up each turn.\n\nAt t=60, y=0, action U, to y=1 at t=61\n\nAt t=61, y=1, action U, to y=2 at t=62\n\n...\n\nAt t=68, y=8, action U, to y=9 at t=69\n\nAt turn t=69, we are at y=9.\n\nNow, the turn when we are at (0,9) is t=69.\n\nt_1=58, so t_1 + H -1 =69, 58 + H -1=69, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions: for turns from t=58 to t=68, that is 11 actions? Turns: t=58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68. That's 11 turns.\n\nt from 58 to 68 inclusive is 68-58+1=11 turns.\n\nBut H should be the number, and we take actions from t=0 to H-1 for the index, but here t_1=58.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0: a_{58}, t=1: a_{59}, ..., up to t=H-1: a_{58 + H -1}\n\nAnd at turn 58 + H -1, y=9.\n\nSet 58 + H -1 =69, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nThen a_{58 + H -1} = a_{69}, but at turn 69, we take action a_{69}, but we are already at y=9 at turn 69, before action.\n\nIn the action sequence, for turn 69, if we take action, it might move away, but since we are at y=9, we can stay or down, but to reach and be at y=9, we stop when we reach.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is to reach y=9.\n\nIn the above, at t=68, we are at y=8, take U, so at t=69, we are at y=9.\n\nSo the action at t=68 is U, which causes us to be at y=9 at turn t=69.\n\nSo for turn t=68, action a_{68}=U.\n\nAnd at turn t=69, y=9.\n\nSo the actions are from t=58 to t=68, which is t=58,59,...,68, that's 11 actions: t=0 to 10 for the index? Let's see.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1: t=0: t_1 +0=58, a_{58}\n\nt=1: t_1+1=59, a_{59}\n\n...\n\nt=k: t_1 + k\n\nSet t_1 + k =68 for last action? Last action is at turn 58 + H -1.\n\nWe want y_{58 + H -1} =9\n\nIn the sequence, after a_{58 + H -2}, we have y_{58 + H -1}, but y_{58 + H -1} is determined by previous actions.\n\nAt turn 58 + H -1, we are at position, and that should be y=9.\n\nThe actions up to a_{58 + H -2} determine y_{58 + H -1}, and we don't take action at turn 58 + H -1 if we are already at y=9, but the sequence includes actions until we reach.\n\nIn the format, we take actions from turn t_1 to the turn before we are at the position or something.\n\nFrom the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nSo for example, with H actions, from t=0 to H-1, we take a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9.\n\nThat means the actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2} determine y_{t_1 + H -1}, and a_{t_1 + H -1} is the action at turn t_1 + H -1, which might be taken, but since we are at y=9, it could be S or something.\n\nBut in this case, for us, to have y_{69}=9, with t_1=58, so t_1 + H -1 =69, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nThen actions from a_{58} to a_{58+11} = a_{69}? t_1 + H -1 =58 +12 -1=69, yes.\n\na_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1: t=0: a_{58}, t=1: a_{59}, ..., t=11: a_{69}\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H -1 =58+12-1=69, y=9.\n\nNow, at turn 69, we are at y=9, so we can take action S, for example, but since we are already at goal, it doesn't matter.\n\nIn the sequence, for the actions to reach, we need to specify the actions until we are at y=9.\n\nBack to the plan.\n\nWe need y_{60}=0.\n\nSo for the first two actions, we need to arrange Δy_{58} and Δy_{59} such that y_{60}=0.\n\nAs above, either:\n\n- a_{58}=S, a_{59}=S: so at t=59, y=0, at t=60, y=0\n\n- or a_{58}=U, a_{59}=D: at t=59, y=1, at t=60, y=0\n\nIn both cases, we are at y=0 at t=60.\n\nThen from t=60 to t=68, we take U each turn to go to y=9 at t=69.\n\nt=60: y=0, action U, to y=1 at t=61\n\nt=61: y=1, action U, to y=2 at t=62\n\n...\n\nt=68: y=8, action U, to y=9 at t=69\n\nAt t=69, y=9.\n\nNow, the actions:\n\nFor the sequence, H=12, actions from a_{58} to a_{69}\n\nBut at t=69, we are at y=9, so a_{69} can be S, for example.\n\nSimilarly, in the first part, we have choices.\n\nTo minimize H, both options have the same H=12.\n\nBut in the second option, with a_{58}=U and a_{59}=D, we go to y=1 and back, which might be unnecessary, so better to stay.\n\nBut H is the same.\n\nNow, but we have row 8 blocked at t=58 and t=59, but since we are at y=0, not on row 8, no issue.\n\nIn the path, when we go up later, we pass row 8 at t= something after t=60, which is safe.\n\nFor example, when we go from y=7 to y=8 at some turn after t=60, row 8 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nBut is there a way to do it faster?\n\nSuppose at t=58, we go U to y=1 at t=59.\n\nBut then at t=59, we are on row 1, which is safe at t=59, but then at t=60, we must not be on rows 1-5, so we need to be at y=0 or y=6,etc, but y=6 not reachable.\n\nIf at t=59, from y=1, we go D to y=0 at t=60, as before.\n\nBut same as staying.\n\nPerhaps we can go to higher rows faster after t=60, but we still need 9 moves.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 6 and 7 are always safe, we could go directly to them, but from y=0, it takes multiple turns.\n\nFor example, if we could be at y=6 at t=60, but impossible in two moves.\n\nMinimal H is 12 in this case.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can be on row 8 at t=60 or something.\n\nRow 8 at t=60 is safe, as we saw.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=60 from y=0 at t=58, need to increase y by 8 in two moves, impossible, max +2.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 12.\n\nNow, for the actions, we can choose the stay option.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nAt t=58: action S (stay), so y_{59}=0\n\nAt t=59: action S (stay), y_{60}=0\n\nAt t=60: action U, y_{61}=1\n\nAt t=61: U, y_{62}=2\n\nAt t=62: U, y_{63}=3\n\nAt t=63: U, y_{64}=4\n\nAt t=64: U, y_{65}=5\n\nAt t=65: U, y_{66}=6\n\nAt t=66: U, y_{67}=7\n\nAt t=67: U, y_{68}=8\n\nAt t=68: U, y_{69}=9\n\nNow, at turn t=69, y=9.\n\nActions: from t=58 to t=68, but for H=12, we need actions up to a_{69}.\n\nAt t=69, we are at y=9, so we take action, say S.\n\nIn the sequence, a_{69} is included.\n\nBut since we are already at goal, it can be S.\n\nTo avoid extra action, but H is fixed by the position.\n\nIn this sequence, with actions a_{58} to a_{68}, we have y_{69}=9, so at turn t=69, we are at y=9, and we haven't taken a_{69} yet.\n\nBut the sequence requires actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and at that turn, y=9.\n\nSo for turn t=69, we take an action, but since we are at y=9, we can take S.\n\nSimilarly, in the list.\n\nTo have exactly H=12, actions a_{58} to a_{69}.\n\nWith the above, a_{58} to a_{68} are the moves, and a_{69} can be S.\n\nBut at t=69, after taking action, we go to y_{70}, but we don't care.\n\nThe position at turn t=69 is y=9, before action.\n\nIn the sequence above, with a_{58}=S, a_{59}=S, a_{60}=U, ..., a_{68}=U, then at turn t=69, y=9.\n\nSo actions from a_{58} to a_{68}, that's 11 actions: t=58 to 68, 11 turns.\n\nThen at turn 69, y=9, so we need to include a_{69} in the sequence for H=12.\n\nSo we must have 12 actions.\n\nThus, at t=69, we take action a_{69}, say S.\n\nSimilarly, with the other option: a_{58}=U, a_{59}=D, a_{60}=U, ..., a_{68}=U, then y_{69}=9, same.\n\nBut with extra move.\n\nIn terms of turns, it's the same H.\n\nBut to be efficient, better to stay at beginning.\n\nNow, in the sequence, for the answer.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nFirst option:\n\nTurn t_1: S  (t_1=58)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: S  (t=59)\n\nThen Turn t_1 +2: U  (t=60)\n\nTurn t_1 +3: U  (t=61)\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 +10: U  (t=68)\n\nThen we need one more action for t_1 +11: a_{69}, which is S, since we are at y=9.\n\nt from 0 to H-1=11 for H=12.\n\nt=0: t_1 +0=58, a_{58}=S\n\nt=1: t_1+1=59, a_{59}=S\n\nt=2: t_1+2=60, a_{60}=U\n\nt=3: t_1+3=61, a_{61}=U\n\nt=4: 62, U\n\nt=5: 63, U\n\nt=6: 64, U\n\nt=7: 65, U\n\nt=8: 66, U\n\nt=9: 67, U\n\nt=10: 68, U  (to y=9 at t=69)\n\nNow at t=11: t_1+11=69, a_{69}=? Since at turn 69, y=9, we can set a_{69}=S.\n\nThen at turn 69, we are at y=9, and we take S, stay at y=9 for t=70, but we don't care.\n\nThe position at turn t=69 is y=9, as required.\n\nSimilarly, we could have a_{58}=U, a_{59}=D, but that might be wasteful, but H same.\n\nNow, but in this, from t=60 to t=68, we go U each turn, but we pass through all rows after t=60, which are safe.\n\nNow, but row 8: when do we pass row 8?\n\nFor example, at some point, y=8.\n\nSuppose at t=67, action U to y=8 at t=68? Let's see the positions.\n\nAt t=60, y=0\n\nt=61, y=1\n\nt=62, y=2\n\n...\n\nt=67, y=7? t=60 y=0, t=61 y=1, t=62 y=2, ..., so at turn T, y_T = T - 60\n\nt=60, y=0\n\nt=61, y=1\n\n...\n\nt=68, y=8\n\nt=69, y=9\n\nSo at turn t=68, y=8, which is row 8.\n\nNow, row 8 at t=68: is it blocked?\n\nRow 8 blocked only at t=58 and t=59, not at t=68, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nNow, but we have row 6 and 7 always safe, but no issue.\n\nNow, is there a way to save one turn?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=1 at t=61, but start moving earlier.\n\nBut at t=60, we must be at y=0.\n\nSuppose at t=58, we go U to y=1 at t=59.\n\nThen at t=59, from y=1, instead of going down, we go up to y=2 at t=60, but blocked.\n\nOr, we stay, blocked.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps we can go to row 6 or 7 directly after, but no.\n\nAnother thought: since row 6 is always safe, if we can reach row 6 earlier, but from start, to reach row 6, it takes at least 6 turns.\n\nBut at t=60, we are at y=0, then it takes 6 more turns to y=6, etc.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal is 9 up moves, plus the waiting at start.\n\nBut in the waiting, we used 2 turns to stay, but we could have used one turn to go up and down, but still 2 turns.\n\nIn the go up and down, it also takes 2 turns for net zero.\n\nSo no saving.\n\nThus H=12 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we can use the stay option.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn t_1: S  (a_{58})\n\nTurn t_1 +1: S  (a_{59})\n\nTurn t_1 +2: U  (a_{60})\n\nTurn t_1 +3: U  (a_{61})\n\nTurn t_1 +4: U  (a_{62})\n\nTurn t_1 +5: U  (a_{63})\n\nTurn t_1 +6: U  (a_{64})\n\nTurn t_1 +7: U  (a_{65})\n\nTurn t_1 +8: U  (a_{66})\n\nTurn t_1 +9: U  (a_{67})\n\nTurn t_1 +10: U  (a_{68})\n\nTurn t_1 +11: S  (a_{69}, at y=9)\n\nIn the list, t from 0 to 11.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn t_1: action\n\nTurn t_1 +1: action\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 +11: action\n\nWith the actions above.\n\nTo make it shorter, but we need 12 actions.\n\nSince at the end, we can stop when we reach, but the format requires H actions including up to the turn we are at position.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps we can reach y=9 earlier by not staying.\n\nFor example, if we start moving later but move faster, but no, we have to wait until after t=60 to traverse rows 1-5.\n\nAfter t=60, we can go up continuously.\n\nBut we lost two turns at start.\n\nPerhaps at t=58, we do nothing, at t=59, we do nothing, then start from t=60.\n\nBut same as above.\n\nI think it's minimal.\n\nNow, but in the car states, for row 3,4,5, there are multiple cars, but we only care about when x=0 covered, which we did.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 has a car at (0,-11,right,6), which covers x=0 at t=58 and 59, but not later.\n\nSo all covered.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 12.\n\nNow for the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nSo for t_1=58:\n\nTurn 58: S\n\nTurn 59: S\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: S\n\nBut at turn 68: action U, to y=9 at turn 69.\n\nThen at turn 69, action S.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write in the format.\n\nFirst, H=12.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t_1: S\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: S\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 4: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 5: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 6: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 7: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 8: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 9: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 10: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 11: S\n\nIn terms of the turn numbers: t_1 + t for t=0 to 11.\n\nt=0: t_1\n\nt=1: t_1+1\n\n...\n\nt=11: t_1+11\n\nActions: S, S, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, S\n\nBut the last S is at turn t_1+11=69, and at that turn, we are at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we can omit the last S if we don't take action, but the format requires H actions until we reach.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nTo have exactly the actions to reach, but with the down option, it might be different.\n\nAnother sequence: a_{58}=U, a_{59}=D, then a_{60}=U, a_{61}=U, ..., a_{68}=U, then a_{69}=S, but at a_{68}=U, to y=9 at t=69, same.\n\nBut with a_{58}=U and a_{59}=D, we have an extra down move, which is not necessary, so better to stay.\n\nThus, the first sequence is better.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 58\\) is 12. This sequence avoids collisions with all cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on rows 1 to 5 at turn 60 (when these rows are blocked) and not on row 8 at turns 58 and 59 (when row 8 is blocked). Rows 6 and 7 are always safe.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- **Turns 58 and 59 (t_1 and t_1 + 1)**: Stay (S) at y=0 to avoid being on any freeway row during the critical turn 60 and the blocked times for row 8.\n- **Turns 60 to 68 (t_1 + 2 to t_1 + 10)**: Move up (U) each turn to progress from y=0 to y=9. After turn 60, rows 1 to 5 are safe, and row 8 is safe from turn 60 onward.\n- **Turn 69 (t_1 + 11)**: Stay (S) at y=9, as the goal is reached.\n\nThe actions ensure that:\n- At turn 60, the player is at y=0 (safe, no freeway).\n- Rows 1 to 5 are traversed after turn 60 when they are safe.\n- Row 8 is traversed at turn 68 (y=8), which is after turn 59 and thus safe.\n- The player reaches y=9 at turn 69.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: S \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 1: S \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 2: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 3: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 4: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 5: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 6: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 7: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 8: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 9: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 10: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 11: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are starting at turn t1 = 60, at position (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8).\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (between 1 and 8) at that turn and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that same turn.\n\nNote: The player is only considered to be on a freeway at turn T if they are on that row at the exact turn T. When moving (U or D), at the moment of the move (turn T) the player is still on the previous row. Then at the next turn, they are on the new row.\n\nSpecifically: \n- At turn T, the player is at y_T.\n- If the action at turn T is U or D, then at turn T+1 the player will be at y_T + (1 or -1) respectively.\n\nTherefore, when we are at turn T and we are on freeway i (so y_T = i), we must check that there is no car on freeway i such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nBut note: if at turn T we are on row i and we move to row i+1 (with action U), then at turn T we are still on row i. At turn T+1 we will be on row i+1. So we only check row i at turn T and row i+1 at turn T+1, etc.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1 (which is 60). For any future turn T (>=60), we can compute the car's span at turn T by:\n\nFor a car given at turn t1 with (head, tail, direction, speed):\n- If direction is left: \n   head(T) = head(t1) - s * (T - t1)\n   tail(T) = tail(t1) - s * (T - t1)\n   and the span is [min(head(T), tail(T)), max(head(T), tail(T))]? Actually note: the original representation for left-moving is given as (head, tail) at t1, but the update rule says for left: [h, τ] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. Since the car is moving left, the entire segment shifts left.\n\nBut note: the representation for left-moving: they give (h, τ) and then the update subtracts. Also, for right-moving, they give (τ, h) and then update by adding? Actually, the update rule says:\n\nLeft: Span(t1)=[h, τ] → [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\nRight: Span(t1)=[τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: in the right case, the initial span is given as [τ, h] meaning τ is the leftmost and h the rightmost? Actually, the update rule for right: it becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)], which is increasing. So the representation for right is that the tail is the left end and head is the right end? \n\nHowever, looking at the data:\n\nFor freeway 3,4,5: \n  (48,37,right,12) -> so at t1=60: the car is from 37 to 48? But the representation says (head, tail) and for right it's [τ, h]. The update rule says: for right, initial span is [τ, h]. So in the data, for a right car, the first number is τ and the second is h? Then the car spans [τ, h] at t1.\n\nBut in freeway 3: we have three cars: \n   (48,37,right,12) -> τ=48? h=37? That would be backwards. Or is it (head, tail) meaning head is 48 and tail is 37? Then for a right-moving car, the head is at the front (right end) and tail at the back (left end). So the span is [tail, head] = [37,48]? \n\nThe update rule for right: [τ, h] → [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. But if τ is the tail (left) and h is the head (right), then the initial span is [τ, h]. So for the car (48,37,right,12): if head=48 and tail=37, then the initial span at t1=60 is [37,48]. Then at a future turn T, it becomes [37+12*(T-60), 48+12*(T-60)].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car: (head, tail) and update: [h, τ] → [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. So for freeway1: (48,83,left,36) -> head=48, tail=83? But then the car would be from 48 to 83? But that's a long car (36 units long? 83-48=35). Then at T: [48-36*(T-60), 83-36*(T-60)].\n\nHowever, note: the problem says for left: \"Span(t1)=[h, τ]\" and then updates. So if h=48 and τ=83, then the car is from 48 to 83? But that would be a car of length 35, and moving left. Then at T: [48-36*(T-60), 83-36*(T-60)].\n\nBut wait: the head is the front? For left-moving, the front (head) is at the left? Then the car extends to the right? Actually, no: when moving left, the head (front) is the leftmost point? Then the tail is the rightmost? So the car is from h to τ, which would be from 48 to 83? But that's a car that is 35 units long and at t1=60, it is at positions 48 to 83? Then as it moves left, the entire segment moves left.\n\nSimilarly, for right: the head is the front (rightmost) and the tail is the leftmost? So the car (48,37,right,12) has head=48 (right end) and tail=37 (left end), so the car is from 37 to 48 (a car of length 11). Then it moves right.\n\nNow, the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway i (so y_T = i) and there is a car on freeway i such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nWe are to avoid that.\n\nWe start at (0,0) at turn 60. We want to get to (0,9). We can move up, down, or stay. But note: we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe are to output the actions starting at turn 60 (t1) and then turn 61, etc., until the turn when we first land on 9.\n\nWe are to minimize the number of turns.\n\nStrategy:\nWe can try to go straight up as fast as possible (only U actions). That would take 9 moves: from 0 to 1, then 2, ... to 9. So 9 turns: at turn 60 we are at 0, then at turn 61 we are at 1, ... at turn 69 we are at 9.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions. We need to check for each freeway we step on at the exact turn we are on that row.\n\nSpecifically, we will be on:\n  turn 60: y=0 -> no freeway (freeways are 1-8) so safe.\n  turn 61: y=1 -> check freeway1 at turn 61.\n  turn 62: y=2 -> check freeway2 at turn 62.\n  ... \n  turn 68: y=8 -> check freeway8 at turn 68.\n  turn 69: y=9 -> goal, no freeway above 8.\n\nBut we must avoid being on freeway i at turn T when 0 is in the car span of any car on that freeway at that same turn T.\n\nLet's compute for each freeway and each turn we plan to be on it (if we go straight up) whether there is a collision.\n\nWe start at turn 60: at freeway0 (which is not a freeway) so skip.\n\nAt turn 61: freeway1.\n\nFreeway1 has one car: (48,83,left,36) at t1=60.\n\nAt turn T=61: \n  head = 48 - 36*(61-60) = 48-36=12\n  tail = 83 - 36*(61-60)=83-36=47\n  So the car is from 12 to 47? But note: the update rule for left: [h,τ] becomes [h-s*(dt), τ-s*(dt)]. But the problem states the initial span as [h, τ] meaning from h to τ? Then at T=61, it is [12,47]. The car is at positions 12 to 47? Then 0 is not in [12,47] -> safe.\n\nAt turn 62: freeway2.\nFreeway2: same car as freeway1: (48,83,left,36)\n  T=62: [48-36*2, 83-36*2] = [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11]\n  Now, the car spans from -24 to 11. 0 is in [-24,11]? Yes. So at turn 62, freeway2 has a car that covers 0? Then we would collide.\n\nTherefore, if we go straight up, at turn 62 we are on freeway2 and there is a car covering 0 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot go straight up.\n\nWe must avoid freeway2 at turn 62.\n\nHow? We can either:\n  (a) Delay going up to freeway2 until the car has passed? But note the car on freeway2 is moving left at 36 per turn. At turn 63: the car would be at [48-36*3, 83-36*3] = [48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25] -> then 0 is not in that interval. So at turn 63, freeway2 is safe.\n\nBut if we delay, we might take more turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can go up to freeway1 at turn61 (safe) and then at turn62 instead of going up to freeway2 (which is unsafe) we can stay on freeway1? Or even go down? But going down would take us back to 0, which is safe but then we have to come up again.\n\nBut note: we are at turn61: y=1 (freeway1). At turn62, we can choose to:\n   - U: go to freeway2 -> unsafe (as above)\n   - D: go back to 0 -> then we are not on any freeway (since freeway0 doesn't exist) -> safe, but then we have to go up again.\n   - S: stay on freeway1.\n\nWhat is the state of freeway1 at turn62?\n  Freeway1 car: (48,83,left,36) at turn62: [48-36*2,83-36*2]=[-24,11]. So 0 is in [-24,11] -> unsafe.\n\nSo if we stay on freeway1 at turn62, we are collided.\n\nTherefore, at turn62 we cannot be on freeway1 either.\n\nSo after turn61 (on freeway1), at turn62 we must leave freeway1. The only safe move is to go down to 0? Then we are at 0 at turn62 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn63, we can try to go up again.\n\nBut at turn63, if we go up to freeway1: we need to check freeway1 at turn63.\n  Freeway1 car: [48-36*3,83-36*3] = [48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn64, we can go to freeway2. Check freeway2 at turn64:\n  Freeway2 car: same as freeway1: [48-36*4,83-36*4] = [48-144,83-144]=[-96,-61] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn65: freeway3.\n\nFreeway3 has three cars: \n  (48,37,right,12): wait, the representation: (head, tail, direction, speed). For right: the car is initially at [τ, h]? But the data says (48,37,right,12). So τ=37? h=48? Then the initial span at t1=60 is [37,48]. Then at turn T: [37+12*(T-60), 48+12*(T-60)].\n\nAt turn65: \n  first car: [37+12*(5), 48+12*(5)] = [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> 0 not in there.\n  second car: (12,1,right,12): [1+12*5,12+12*5]=[1+60,12+60]=[61,72] -> safe.\n  third car: (-24,-35,right,12): [-35+12*5, -24+12*5] = [-35+60, -24+60]=[25,36] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway3 at turn65 is safe.\n\nThen freeway4 at turn66: same cars as freeway3? Actually, freeway4 has the same set of cars: \n  (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAt turn66: \n  T-60=6\n  first: [37+12*6,48+12*6]=[37+72,48+72]=[109,120]\n  second: [1+72,12+72]=[73,84]\n  third: [-35+72, -24+72]=[37,48]\n  all above 0 -> safe.\n\nFreeway5 at turn67: same as above with T-60=7:\n  first: [37+84,48+84]=[121,132]\n  second: [1+84,12+84]=[85,96]\n  third: [-35+84,-24+84]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\nFreeway6 at turn68: \n  Freeway6: only one car: (48,37,right,6) -> so initial [37,48] at t1=60? \n  Then at turn68 (T-60=8): [37+6*8,48+6*8]=[37+48,48+48]=[85,96] -> safe.\n\nFreeway7 at turn69: \n  Freeway7: same car? (48,37,right,6) -> [37+6*9,48+6*9]=[37+54,48+54]=[91,102] -> safe.\n\nFreeway8 at turn70: \n  Freeway8: two cars: (48,37,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n  First car: [37+6*10,48+6*10]=[37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe.\n  Second car: (-11,0,right,6) -> wait, the data says (0,-11,right,6). How to interpret? \n      For right-moving: the representation is (head, tail) and then the initial span is [τ, h]. \n      So here: head=0, tail=-11? Then initial span at t1=60 is [tail, head] = [-11,0]. \n      Then at turn T: [-11+6*(T-60), 0+6*(T-60)]\n\n  At turn70 (T-60=10): [-11+60, 0+60] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn70 we would be at y=8? Actually, if we started at turn60:0, then:\n  turn60: start at 0 -> safe (not freeway)\n  turn61: U -> 1 -> safe\n  turn62: D -> 0 (to avoid freeway1 at turn62 and freeway2 at turn62) -> safe\n  turn63: U -> 1 -> safe (freeway1 at turn63: [-60,-25] -> safe)\n  turn64: U -> 2 -> safe (freeway2 at turn64: [-96,-61] -> safe)\n  turn65: U -> 3 -> safe (as above)\n  turn66: U -> 4 -> safe\n  turn67: U -> 5 -> safe\n  turn68: U -> 6 -> safe\n  turn69: U -> 7 -> safe\n  turn70: U -> 8 -> safe (freeway8 at turn70: safe as above)\n  turn71: U -> 9 -> goal.\n\nSo total 11 turns? But we are at 9 at turn71? Actually, we started at turn60 at 0. Then:\n  turn60: at 0 (start)\n  turn61: at 1 (after U at turn60)\n  turn62: at 0 (after D at turn61)\n  turn63: at 1 (after U at turn62)\n  turn64: at 2 (after U at turn63)\n  turn65: at 3\n  turn66: at 4\n  turn67: at 5\n  turn68: at 6\n  turn69: at 7\n  turn70: at 8\n  turn71: at 9\n\nSo we reach at turn71. But is that minimal?\n\nAlternatively, can we avoid the delay? We had to avoid freeway2 at turn62 and freeway1 at turn62.\n\nBut what if we go faster? We cannot go faster than one step per turn.\n\nAlternatively, we might take a different path? For example, go up to freeway1 at turn61, then at turn62 instead of going down, we could go up to freeway2? But we saw that freeway2 at turn62 is unsafe. Or we could go to freeway3 earlier? But we have to go through 2.\n\nWhat if we wait at 0 for one turn? \n  turn60: S -> stay at 0 -> safe.\n  turn61: U -> 1 -> safe (freeway1 at turn61: [12,47] -> safe)\n  turn62: U -> 2 -> unsafe? freeway2 at turn62: [-24,11] -> unsafe.\n\nSame problem.\n\nWait two turns at 0?\n  turn60: S\n  turn61: S\n  turn62: U -> 1: freeway1 at turn62: [-24,11] -> unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo we have to leave freeway1 by turn62? We did by going down at turn61.\n\nBut note: we could go up to freeway1 at turn61 (safe), then at turn62 we go up to freeway2? But we saw freeway2 is unsafe at turn62. What if we go to freeway3 at turn62? We can't: we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo the above path (with the down move) seems necessary.\n\nBut let me check if we can avoid the down move by waiting at 0 for one turn and then going up? We tried and freeway1 at turn62 is unsafe.\n\nAlternatively, we might go down at the start? But we are at 0, we cannot go down.\n\nSo the minimal path we have so far is 11 moves? But wait, we did 11 actions? Actually, from turn60 to turn71 we do 11 actions? But the starting turn is 60, and we do actions at turns 60,61,...,70 (11 actions) and then at turn71 we are at 9.\n\nBut we can try to see if we can get to 9 in less than 11 turns? The minimal without obstacles is 9. But we have obstacles at turn62 for freeway2 and freeway1. So we have to lose at least 2 turns? Actually, in our path we did an extra down and then an extra up, which cost two extra moves? So 9+2=11.\n\nBut note: we did two extra moves: one down (from 1 to 0) and then one up (from 0 to 1) again. So we lost two moves.\n\nCan we do it in 10? That is, lose only one move? \n\nWe must avoid being on freeway1 at turn62 and freeway2 at turn62. \n\nWhat if we do:\n  turn60: U -> 1 (safe at turn61: freeway1 has [12,47])\n  turn61: U -> 2 (at turn62: freeway2 has [-24,11] -> unsafe) -> not allowed.\n\n  turn60: U -> 1\n  turn61: S -> stay at 1? but at turn62: freeway1 has [-24,11] -> unsafe.\n\n  turn60: S -> stay at 0\n  turn61: U -> 1 (safe: freeway1 at turn61: [12,47])\n  turn62: U -> 2 -> unsafe.\n\n  turn60: U -> 1\n  turn61: D -> 0 (safe at turn62: we are at 0, not a freeway)\n  turn62: U -> 1: now at turn63: freeway1 at turn63: [-60,-25] -> safe.\n  then we continue as before.\n\nBut then we are at turn62: at 0, and then at turn63: at 1, then we go up to 2 at turn64, and then 3 at turn65, ... 8 at turn70, and 9 at turn71. That's 11 turns.\n\nAlternatively, after going down to 0 at turn61, we might go up twice in a row? But we can only move one per turn.\n\nIs there a way to be on freeway3 earlier? We have to go through 1 and 2.\n\nWhat if we skip freeway1 and freeway2 by going from 0 to 2 in one move? But we can't: we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo 11 moves seems the minimal.\n\nBut let me check the cars again: especially freeway8 at turn70 is safe? We did.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway8 at turn70? We have two cars: \n  (48,37,right,6): at turn70: [37+6*10,48+6*10]=[97,108] -> safe.\n  (0,-11,right,6): at turn70: [-11+6*10, 0+6*10] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\nBut note: the second car at turn70: the head was 0 at turn60? Then at turn70, it becomes 0+6*10=60? and the tail -11+60=49? Then the car is from 49 to 60? So 0 is not in [49,60]. Safe.\n\nBut what if we get to freeway8 earlier? In the above path, we are at freeway8 at turn70. But if we could get there at an earlier turn, we might save time.\n\nBut we are constrained by the lower freeways.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to go faster through the lower freeways? We were delayed by two moves in the beginning. Then we go through freeways 3-8 without delay. So total moves: 9 moves for the 9 levels, plus 2 extra moves (the down and the extra up) -> 11.\n\nBut note: we start at 0 and need to get to 9: that's 9 upward moves. However, we did 10 upward moves and 1 downward move? \n  Actions: \n    turn60: U -> +1 (to 1)\n    turn61: D -> -1 (to 0)\n    turn62: U -> +1 (to 1)\n    turn63: U -> +1 (to 2)\n    turn64: U -> to3\n    turn65: to4\n    turn66: to5\n    turn67: to6\n    turn68: to7\n    turn69: to8\n    turn70: to9? no, at turn70 we are at 8, then turn71: U to9.\n\nActually, we did 10 U moves and 1 D move. The net displacement is 10-1=9. So that's correct.\n\nBut we did 11 moves.\n\nCan we do it in 10? We need 9 net up moves. We can have 10 moves if we have 10 U and 0 D? That would get us to 10, which is invalid. Or 9 U and 1 S? Then we get to 9, but then we have 9 moves? But we had to do an extra move for the detour.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid the down move by using a different strategy: maybe wait at freeway1 for the car to pass? But the car on freeway1 at turn62 is unsafe, so we cannot stay. And we cannot go up to freeway2 because it's unsafe.\n\nAnother idea: what if we go down at turn60? But we are at 0, we cannot go down.\n\nSo we must go up at turn60 to freeway1? Then at turn61 we have to leave freeway1 (because at turn62 we cannot be there). The only safe place to leave is to go down to 0.\n\nTherefore, the minimal path is 11 moves.\n\nBut let me check if we can skip the wait at 0 and go directly to freeway3? We can't because we can only move one per turn.\n\nAnother idea: after going down to 0 at turn61, we can then at turn62 go up to 1 (safe at turn63) and then at turn63 go to 2 (safe at turn64). Then we are at the same as before.\n\nBut note: at turn62, when we are at 0, we don't need to go up at turn62? We could wait at 0? But that would cost an extra move. Then we would get to 9 at turn72? Worse.\n\nSo the above 11-move path is minimal.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway8? We are going to be on freeway8 at turn70. But what if we can get to freeway8 earlier? Then we could get to 9 earlier.\n\nHow? We are at freeway7 at turn69. Then we go to 8 at turn70. Then to 9 at turn71. We can't skip.\n\nBut let me check freeway8 at an earlier turn? For example, if we could get to freeway8 at turn68? Then we would be at 8 at turn68, then 9 at turn69.\n\nBut to get to 8 at turn68, we would have to be at 7 at turn67, 6 at turn66, etc. Then we would be at freeway2 at turn62? But we had to avoid that.\n\nAlternatively, if we can get to freeway8 at turn69? Then we would be at 9 at turn70.\n\nBut in our path we are at freeway8 at turn70. How can we get to freeway8 at turn69? Then we would have to be at freeway7 at turn68.\n\nLet's see if we can advance the whole chain by one turn? But we are delayed at the beginning.\n\nSuppose:\n  turn60: U -> 1 (safe: turn61, freeway1: [12,47])\n  turn61: D -> 0 (safe: turn62, at 0)\n  turn62: U -> 1 (safe: turn63, freeway1: [-60,-25])\n  turn63: U -> 2 (safe: turn64, freeway2: [-96,-61])\n  turn64: U -> 3 (safe: turn65, freeway3: as above for turn65: safe)\n  turn65: U -> 4 (safe: turn66, freeway4: same as freeway3 at turn66? Actually, freeway4 at turn66: we computed above for turn66: safe)\n  turn66: U -> 5 (safe: freeway5 at turn67: safe)\n  turn67: U -> 6 (safe: freeway6 at turn68: [37+6*8,48+6*8]=[85,96] -> safe)\n  turn68: U -> 7 (safe: freeway7 at turn69: [37+6*9,48+6*9]=[91,102] -> safe)\n  turn69: U -> 8 (freeway8 at turn69: we must check)\n\nFreeway8 at turn69 (T=69, dt=9):\n  First car: (48,37,right,6): [37+6*9,48+6*9]=[37+54,48+54]=[91,102] -> safe.\n  Second car: (0,-11,right,6): [-11+6*9, 0+6*9] = [-11+54, 0+54] = [43,54] -> safe.\n\nSo then at turn69 we are at 8, then turn70: U -> 9.\n\nTotal turns: 10 actions? \n  We start at turn60: action at 60,61,...,69? That's 10 actions. Then at turn70 we are at 9.\n\nBut wait: at turn60: we start at 0 (given). Then:\n  turn60: U -> at turn61: 1\n  turn61: D -> at turn62: 0\n  turn62: U -> at turn63: 1\n  turn63: U -> at turn64: 2\n  turn64: U -> at turn65: 3\n  turn65: U -> at turn66: 4\n  turn66: U -> at turn67: 5\n  turn67: U -> at turn68: 6\n  turn68: U -> at turn69: 7\n  turn69: U -> at turn70: 8? We wanted to be at 8 at turn69? But we are at 7 at turn69? \n\nMistake: \n  turn68: we are at 6? Then we do U at turn68: at turn69 we are at 7? Then at turn69 we do U: at turn70 we are at 8? Then we need turn71 to get to 9.\n\nBut in the above, I said at turn69 we do U to go to 8? But at turn69 we are at 7 (from the previous move at turn68: U from 6 to7 at turn69). Then at turn69 we do U: then at turn70 we are at 8. Then we need another U at turn70 to get to 9 at turn71.\n\nBut wait, I thought we could get to 8 at turn69? How? We would have to be at 7 at turn68? Then at turn68 we do U: then at turn69 we are at 8.\n\nSo let's reassign the turns:\n\n  turn60: start at 0\n  turn60: U -> at turn61: 1\n  turn61: D -> at turn62: 0\n  turn62: U -> at turn63: 1\n  turn63: U -> at turn64: 2\n  turn64: U -> at turn65: 3\n  turn65: U -> at turn66: 4\n  turn66: U -> at turn67: 5\n  turn67: U -> at turn68: 6\n  turn68: U -> at turn69: 7\n  turn69: U -> at turn70: 8\n  turn70: U -> at turn71: 9 -> 11 moves.\n\nBut if we can get to 7 at turn68? Then we can do:\n\n  turn60: U -> 1 (at turn61)\n  turn61: D -> 0 (at turn62)\n  turn62: U -> 1 (at turn63)\n  turn63: U -> 2 (at turn64)\n  turn64: U -> 3 (at turn65)\n  turn65: U -> 4 (at turn66)\n  turn66: U -> 5 (at turn67)\n  turn67: U -> 6 (at turn68)\n  turn68: U -> 7 (at turn69) -> then we are at 7 at turn69.\n\nBut we want to be at 8 at turn69? How? We would have to be at 7 at turn68? Then we can go to 8 at turn68? But we are at 6 at turn68? \n\nActually, to be at 8 at turn69, we must be at 7 at turn68? Then at turn68 we do U to go to 8 at turn69.\n\nBut we are at 6 at turn68? Then we can only get to 7 at turn69.\n\nSo we cannot get to 8 at turn69.\n\nBut in the above, if we try to push, we are at 7 at turn69. Then we go to 8 at turn70, and then 9 at turn71.\n\nBut what if we skip one of the moves? We can't.\n\nAlternatively, we might not go down to 0? We have to avoid the collision at freeway1 and freeway2 at turn62.\n\nBut note: we could go to freeway3 at turn62? How? We can only move one step per turn, so from 1 (at turn61) we can only go to 0 or 2 at turn62.\n\nBut freeway2 at turn62 is unsafe, so we must avoid. So we have to go to 0.\n\nTherefore, the minimal is 11 moves.\n\nBut wait: we have freeway8 at turn70: safe. And we have 11 moves.\n\nBut let me check if there is a way to avoid the extra moves in the higher freeways? For example, freeway8 has a car that is at (0,-11) at turn60? Then at turn61: [-11+6,0+6]=[-5,6] -> so at turn61, freeway8 has a car covering 0? Then if we were at freeway8 at turn61, we would collide. But we are not.\n\nBut in our path we are at freeway8 at turn70: safe.\n\nBut what if we try to go through freeway8 earlier? We can't because we are delayed at the beginning.\n\nAlternatively, we might take a different route: go up to 1 at turn60, then at turn61 go up to 2 (unsafe) -> not allowed.\n\nOr: go up to 1 at turn60, then at turn61 stay? unsafe at turn62 on freeway1.\n\nSo we have to go down.\n\nBut note: what if we go up to 1 at turn60, then at turn61 go up to 2 (unsafe) -> not allowed.\n\nSo the path we have is the only safe one.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: D\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: U\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: U\nTurn 66: U\nTurn 67: U\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\n\nThen at turn71 we are at 9.\n\nBut wait: we start at turn60 at 0. Then:\n  After Turn60: U -> at turn61: 1\n  After Turn61: D -> at turn62: 0\n  After Turn62: U -> at turn63: 1\n  After Turn63: U -> at turn64: 2\n  After Turn64: U -> at turn65: 3\n  After Turn65: U -> at turn66: 4\n  After Turn66: U -> at turn67: 5\n  After Turn67: U -> at turn68: 6\n  After Turn68: U -> at turn69: 7\n  After Turn69: U -> at turn70: 8\n  After Turn70: U -> at turn71: 9\n\nSo we need 11 actions: from turn60 to turn70.\n\nBut the problem says: sequence of actions for t = t1 (60) to t1+H-1. And H is the minimal number of turns. So H=11.\n\nBut let me confirm the collision at freeway1 and freeway2 at the critical turns:\n\nAt turn61: we are at freeway1: car on freeway1: [48-36,83-36]=[12,47] -> safe.\nAt turn62: we are at 0 -> safe (not a freeway).\nAt turn63: we are at freeway1: [48-36*3,83-36*3]=[-60,-25] -> safe.\nAt turn64: freeway2: [48-36*4,83-36*4]=[-96,-61] -> safe.\n\nAnd then the rest we already checked.\n\nBut note: what about freeway3 at turn65? We checked: safe.\n\nHowever, let me double-check freeway3 at turn65 (T=65, dt=5):\n  Cars on freeway3: \n    (48,37,right,12): [37+12*5,48+12*5]=[37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe.\n    (12,1,right,12): [1+60,12+60]=[61,72] -> safe.\n    (-24,-35,right,12): [-35+60, -24+60]=[25,36] -> safe.\n\nFreeway4 at turn66 (dt=6):\n    (48,37): [37+72,48+72]=[109,120]\n    (12,1): [1+72,12+72]=[73,84]\n    (-24,-35): [-35+72, -24+72]=[37,48] -> safe.\n\nFreeway5 at turn67 (dt=7):\n    (48,37): [37+84,48+84]=[121,132]\n    (12,1): [1+84,12+84]=[85,96]\n    (-24,-35): [-35+84, -24+84]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\nFreeway6 at turn68 (dt=8): \n    Only one car: (48,37,right,6): [37+6*8,48+6*8]=[37+48,48+48]=[85,96] -> safe.\n\nFreeway7 at turn69 (dt=9): same as freeway6: [37+54,48+54]=[91,102] -> safe.\n\nFreeway8 at turn70 (dt=10):\n    First car: (48,37,right,6): [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe.\n    Second car: (0,-11,right,6): [-11+60,0+60]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nBut note: we are at freeway8 at turn70? But we are at row 8 at turn70? Then we do U at turn70 to go to 9 at turn71. At turn71, we are at 9, which is not a freeway, so safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is 11 actions.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=11. Is there a shorter path?\n\nWhat if we try to go up to 1 at turn60, then at turn61 we go up to 2? We know freeway2 at turn62 is unsafe. But what if we are not at freeway2 at turn62? \n\nActually, when we do an action at turn T, we move at the end of the turn? The update is: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at the start of turn60: we are at 0.\nAfter action at turn60: we move to 1 at the start of turn61? Or at the end of turn60?\n\nThe problem states: \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nSo at time t, we are at y_t. Then we choose an action a_t, which determines Δy_t. Then at time t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, at turn60, we start at y60=0. Then we do a60, and then at turn61 we are at y61 = y60 + Δy60.\n\nSo the collision check at turn T is for the row y_T.\n\nIn our plan:\n  At turn60: y60=0 -> safe (no freeway)\n  At turn61: y61=1 -> check freeway1 at turn61: safe.\n  At turn62: y62=0 (if we did D at turn61) -> safe.\n\nBut if we did U at turn61, then at turn62 we would be at 2 -> then check freeway2 at turn62: unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid that.\n\nTherefore, the path we have is safe and minimal.\n\nSo the answer:\n\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: D\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: U\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: U\nTurn 66: U\nTurn 67: U\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\n\nWe do not need to write beyond that because after the last action (at turn70) we will be at 9 at turn71. But the problem says: we need to output the sequence until we reach (0,9). The last action is at turn70, which moves us from 8 (at turn70) to 9 at turn71. So the sequence is from turn60 to turn70 (11 actions).\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we reach at turn t1+H-1? \n\nWait: we start at turn t1 = 60. We do actions at t=60,61,...,70 (which are t1+0 to t1+10). So H = number of turns = 11. Then we reach at turn t1+H-1 = 60+11-1 = 70? But at turn70 we are at 8? Then we move to 9 at turn71? \n\nMistake: \n\nAt turn60 (t1): we start at 0. Then we do an action at turn60: which moves us to 1 at turn61. The last action we do is at turn70: which moves us to 9 at turn71.\n\nBut the problem says: we must reach (0,9) at the turn after the last action? \n\nLet me see: \n  We do an action at each turn from 60 to 70 (inclusive): that's 11 actions. \n  Then at the next turn (71) we are at 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" to reach at turn t1+H-1? \n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1 + H? \n\nActually, we start at turn t1. After one action (at turn t1), we are at turn t1+1. After two actions, at turn t1+2. ... After H actions, we are at turn t1+H.\n\nBut we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H? \n\nIn our case: \n  After 0 actions: turn60: at 0.\n  After 1 action: turn61: at y61 = 0 + (if a60=U) 1 -> 1.\n  ...\n  After 11 actions: turn60+11 = turn71: at y71 = 9.\n\nSo we want to be at 9 at the end of the last action? That is, at turn t1+H? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nLet me read: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1? So the total actions is H. Then the last state is at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" which means t runs from 0 to H-1, so the actions are at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the state after these actions is at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nNo, the problem does not explicitly say the turn at which we reach. It says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nBut note: the last action is at turn t1+H-1. Then the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state after the action at turn t1+H-2? \n\nLet me clarify the timeline:\n\n  Turn t1: we start at state y_{t1} = 0.\n  Then we do action a_{t1} (at turn t1) -> then we get y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}.\n  Then we do action a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1 -> then we get y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy_{t1+1}.\n  ...\n  Then we do action a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1 -> then we get y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy_{t1+H-1}.\n\nThe problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\nBut that would be the state before the last action? \n\nNo, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nBut in our case, we want to be at 9 at the state at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut that means we do not need to do the last action? \n\nLet me read carefully: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nBut then it says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nSo the last state we care about is at turn t1+H-1, and we are at 9 at that turn.\n\nIn our path, when are we at 9? At turn71. And we started at turn60. So turn71 = t1+11? So H-1 = 11? Then H=12? \n\nBut that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the state at the end of the sequence of actions: \n\nThe sequence of actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}. Then the state after the last action is at turn t1+H. But the problem says we must be at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me see the problem again: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" \n\nThis means t=0,1,...,H-1 -> so the actions are at turns: t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen the state after these actions is at turn t1+H. But the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nBut y_{t1+H-1} is the state at the beginning of the last action? \n\nFor example, if H=1: then we do one action at turn t1 (t=0). Then the state after the action is y_{t1+1}. But the problem says we want y_{t1+1-1}=y_{t1}=9? \n\nBut we start at y_{t1}=0.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding.\n\nLooking back: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then in the answer format, it lists actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut when do we reach? \n\nThe problem also says: \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nSo the state at turn t+1 is determined by the action at turn t.\n\nTherefore, the state at turn t is known at the beginning of turn t.\n\nThen we do action a_t at turn t, and that affects y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to be at 9 at turn T, we must have done an action at turn T-1 that moved us to 9.\n\nIn our case, we want to be at 9 at some turn T. The turn T must be at least t1+9 because we start at 0.\n\nThe actions we do are from turn t1 to turn T-1? \n\nFor example, to get to 9 at turn t1+9, we would do actions at turns t1 to t1+8 (9 actions) and then at turn t1+9 we are at 9.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, and then we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we did actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2? Because the action at turn t1+H-2 would be the last one that affects y_{t1+H-1}.\n\nBut then the number of actions is H-1.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", which would be H actions.\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nLet me re-read the problem: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then in the answer format, it writes:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n...\nup to Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nThen after doing these H actions, we should be at 9.\n\nBut when? After the last action, we are at turn t1+H. So we want y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nIn our plan, we are at 9 at turn71 = 60+11. So we want H=11, and then y_{60+11}=y_{71}=9.\n\nTherefore, the sequence has H=11 actions: from turn60 to turn70.\n\nAnd then at turn71 we are at 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"? \n\nIt doesn't say that in the task description. In the task description, it only says: \"to reach (0,9)\".\n\nBut in the answer format, it says: \n  \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\"\n  ...\n  \"Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\"\n\nSo the last action is at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThen the state after that action is y_{t1+H}.\n\nSo we require y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nTherefore, in our case, we require turn71=60+11=71, so H=11.\n\nAnd the last action is at turn70.\n\nSo the sequence is 11 actions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: D\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: U\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: U\nTurn 66: U\nTurn 67: U\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\n}\n\nThis is minimal.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 60\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) as follows:\n\n- **Turn 60 (start at \\(y = 0\\))**: Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 61. At turn 61, freeway 1 is safe (car spans [12, 47], 0 not in span).\n- **Turn 61**: Action \\(D\\) moves to \\(y = 0\\) at turn 62. At turn 62, \\(y = 0\\) is not a freeway, so safe.\n- **Turn 62**: Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 63. At turn 63, freeway 1 is safe (car spans [-60, -25], 0 not in span).\n- **Turn 63**: Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 64. At turn 64, freeway 2 is safe (car spans [-96, -61], 0 not in span).\n- **Turn 64**: Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 65. At turn 65, freeway 3 is safe (cars: [97, 108], [61, 72], [25, 36]; 0 not in any span).\n- **Turn 65**: Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 66. At turn 66, freeway 4 is safe (cars: [109, 120], [73, 84], [37, 48]; 0 not in any span).\n- **Turn 66**: Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 67. At turn 67, freeway 5 is safe (cars: [121, 132], [85, 96], [49, 60]; 0 not in any span).\n- **Turn 67**: Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 68. At turn 68, freeway 6 is safe (car spans [85, 96], 0 not in span).\n- **Turn 68**: Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 69. At turn 69, freeway 7 is safe (car spans [91, 102], 0 not in span).\n- **Turn 69**: Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 70. At turn 70, freeway 8 is safe (cars: [97, 108], [49, 60]; 0 not in any span).\n- **Turn 70**: Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 71, reaching the goal.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 71 (\\(t_1 + 11\\)) without collisions. No shorter path is possible due to collisions on freeways 1 and 2 at turn 62, necessitating the detour to \\(y = 0\\) at turn 62.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 60: U \\\\\nTurn 61: D \\\\\nTurn 62: U \\\\\nTurn 63: U \\\\\nTurn 64: U \\\\\nTurn 65: U \\\\\nTurn 66: U \\\\\nTurn 67: U \\\\\nTurn 68: U \\\\\nTurn 69: U \\\\\nTurn 70: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 62, and the player is at (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8). The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The movement is only in the y-direction (vertical).\n\nImportant note: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that same turn T, the car on that freeway has its span covering the x=0 position. However, note that when the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is still on y_T. Then at the next turn (T+1) the player will be on y_{T+1}. So, when moving, we only check the freeway we are currently on (at the start of the turn) for collision.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn t1 (which is 62) until the turn when the player reaches y=9.\n\nLet me denote:\n- The current turn is t = 62, and the player is at y=0.\n- We need to compute for each future turn T (relative to t1=62) the positions of the cars on each freeway.\n\nFirst, note that the car update rules:\nFor a car given by (head, tail, direction, speed) at turn t1=62, then at turn T (>=62), the car's span is:\n  If left-moving: [h - s*(T-62), tail - s*(T-62)]\n  If right-moving: [tail + s*(T-62), head + s*(T-62)]   [Note: the representation for right-moving: originally at t1, the span is [tau, h] meaning from tau to h, so after moving, it becomes [tau + s*(T-62), h + s*(T-62)]\n\nBut note: the problem says for left-moving: span at t1 is [h, tau] (which I assume is from h to tau, but typically we think of [min, max]). However, in the update, for left-moving: [h - s*(T-62), tau - s*(T-62)]. Since the car is moving left, the entire segment moves left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: originally [tau, h] (which is from tau to h) becomes [tau + s*(T-62), h + s*(T-62)].\n\nBut note: the problem states that the collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in the span of the car on the freeway y_T (the freeway the player is on at turn T). And the player is at (0, y_T) at turn T.\n\nSo, for each freeway and each car on that freeway, we can compute the span at any future turn T.\n\nWe are going to plan a path from y=0 to y=9. We start at y=0 at turn 62. We can only change y by at most 1 per turn, so we need at least 9 moves (if we go up every turn). But we have to avoid the freeways at the moments when the player is on them and there is a car covering x=0.\n\nNote: at y=0 and y=9, there are no cars (freeways are from 1 to 8). So we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nWe need to traverse y=1 to y=8 without being at a freeway when a car is covering x=0.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H (number of turns) and the sequence.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we want to go up as much as possible. However, we might have to wait (stay) or even move down to avoid a collision.\n\nLet me compute the car positions at future turns for each freeway. We are interested in when a car on a freeway covers x=0.\n\nFor each freeway k (1 to 8) and each car on that freeway, we can compute the time intervals (in terms of turns) during which the car covers x=0.\n\nBut note: the cars are moving continuously? Actually, the problem gives discrete updates. We are only concerned with the exact turn T.\n\nWe can compute for each freeway k and each car, the set of turns T for which 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nHowever, note that multiple cars on the same freeway? Yes, freeway 3,4,5 have three cars, freeway 8 has two cars.\n\nLet me list the cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n  This car is left-moving. At turn T, span: [ -24 - 36*(T-62), 11 - 36*(T-62) ]\n  We require 0 to be in [A, B] where A = -24 -36*(T-62), B = 11 -36*(T-62)\n  So: A <= 0 <= B\n      => -24 -36*(T-62) <= 0 <= 11 -36*(T-62)\n\n  Let me set d = T-62 (nonnegative integer)\n\n  First inequality: -24 -36d <= 0  => -36d <= 24 => d >= -24/36 -> which is negative, so always true for d>=0.\n  Second inequality: 0 <= 11 - 36d => 36d <= 11 => d <= 11/36 = 0.3055 -> so only d=0.\n\n  Thus, at d=0 (i.e., T=62) the car covers 0? Let's check:\n      At T=62: span = [-24, 11] -> which includes 0? Yes, because -24<=0<=11.\n      At T=63: span = [-24-36, 11-36] = [-60, -25] -> 0 is not in this.\n\n  So freeway 1 is dangerous only at T=62.\n\nBut note: at turn T=62, we are at y=0. We are not on freeway 1 until we move to y=1. So we are safe at T=62 on freeway 0.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-24,11,left,36) -> same analysis: dangerous only at T=62.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars:\n  Car1: (-48, -59, right, 12) -> wait, the representation: at t1, the span is [tau, h]? The problem says for right-moving: originally [tau, h] meaning from tau to h? But here given as (head, tail) = (-48, -59) and direction right? \n\n  Let me read the table: the cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\n  For right-moving, the problem states: \"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [tau, h]\". But the table says: (head, tail) and then direction. \n\n  So for a right-moving car, the head is the front? Then the span at t1 should be [tail, head]? \n\n  The problem says: for right-moving: [tau, h] -> meaning tau is the tail and h is the head? \n\n  In the table, the first two numbers are head and tail? Then for right-moving, the head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the rear (leftmost). So the span at t1 is [tail, head]. \n\n  Therefore, for freeway 3, car1: head=-48, tail=-59, direction=right -> so the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-59, -48]? But that doesn't make sense because -59 < -48, so it should be from -59 to -48? \n\n  However, the update rule for right-moving: \n      Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-62), head + s*(T-62)] = [-59 + 12*(T-62), -48 + 12*(T-62)]\n\n  Now, we require 0 to be in [A, B] = [ -59+12d, -48+12d ] where d=T-62.\n\n  So: -59+12d <= 0 <= -48+12d\n\n  First: -59+12d <= 0 -> 12d <= 59 -> d <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916 -> d<=4\n  Second: 0 <= -48+12d -> 12d >= 48 -> d>=4.\n\n  So d=4: then [ -59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0] -> 0 is included? Yes, because the interval is [-11,0] (assuming inclusive) -> so 0 is the right endpoint? The problem doesn't specify open/closed, but typically we assume closed intervals. So yes, 0 is included.\n\n  d=5: [ -59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\n  So only at d=4, i.e., T=62+4=66.\n\n  Similarly, car2: (36,25,right,12) -> head=36, tail=25? Then span at t1: [25,36]. \n      Update: [25+12d, 36+12d]\n      We require: 25+12d <= 0 <= 36+12d -> but 25+12d>=25>0 for d>=0 -> no solution. So this car never covers 0.\n\n  Car3: (0,-11,right,12) -> head=0, tail=-11 -> span at t1: [-11,0] -> already at t1 (d=0) it covers 0? \n      But note: at T=62, the car is at [-11,0] -> which includes 0? Yes.\n      Then update: [ -11+12d, 0+12d] = [-11+12d, 12d]\n      We require: -11+12d <= 0 <= 12d\n          First: -11+12d <=0 -> 12d<=11 -> d<=0.916 -> d=0\n          Second: 0<=12d -> d>=0 -> so only d=0? But let's check d=1: [1,12] -> doesn't include 0; d=0: [-11,0] includes 0.\n\n      However, wait: at d=0 (T=62) we have the car at [-11,0] -> 0 is included. But also at d=1: [1,12] -> no. But what about fractional? We are at integer turns.\n\n      Actually, note: the car might cover 0 at non-integer times? But we are only checking at integer turns. So only T=62.\n\n  Therefore, for freeway 3: \n      dangerous at T=62 (from car3) and T=66 (from car1).\n\nBut wait: at T=62, we are at y=0? We are not on freeway 3. So that doesn't affect us. The dangerous turns for freeway 3 are T=66 (from car1) and T=62 (from car3) but T=62 is the starting turn and we are not on freeway 3 at turn 62.\n\nFreeway 4: same cars as freeway 3? \n  The table says: same three cars: (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n  So same as freeway 3: dangerous at T=62 (car3) and T=66 (car1). But again, T=62 we are at y=0.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 3 and 4: dangerous at T=66 (and T=62, but T=62 not on freeway5).\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (60,49,right,6) -> head=60, tail=49, so span at t1: [49,60]. Update: [49+6d, 60+6d]. \n  We require 49+6d<=0<=60+6d -> but 49+6d>=49>0 -> no solution. So never dangerous.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6: (60,49,right,6) -> never dangerous.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars:\n  Car1: (60,49,right,6) -> same as above: never dangerous.\n  Car2: (12,1,right,6) -> head=12, tail=1, so span at t1: [1,12]. Update: [1+6d, 12+6d]. \n      We require: 1+6d<=0<=12+6d -> \n          First: 1+6d<=0 -> 6d<=-1 -> impossible since d>=0.\n      So never dangerous.\n\nSo summarizing the dangerous turns for each freeway (where the freeway has at least one car covering x=0 at that turn):\n\nFreeway 1: T=62 (only) -> but at T=62 we are at y=0, so if we are on freeway1 at T=62? We are not. So we can be on freeway1 at any turn except T=62? But T=62 is the starting turn and we are at y=0. The next time we can be on freeway1 is at T>=63. And at T>=63, freeway1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2: only dangerous at T=62 -> safe for T>=63.\n\nFreeway3: dangerous at T=66 (and also T=62, but T=62 we are at y=0). So we must avoid being on freeway3 at T=66.\nFreeway4: same as freeway3: avoid at T=66.\nFreeway5: same: avoid at T=66.\n\nFreeways 6,7,8: never dangerous.\n\nSo the only dangerous event is on freeways 3,4,5 at T=66.\n\nTherefore, we must not be on freeway 3,4, or 5 at turn T=66.\n\nNote: we are starting at y=0 at T=62.\n\nWe want to get to y=9. We can plan:\n\nWe have to pass through y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nThe only constraint is at T=66: we must not be on y=3,4,5.\n\nSo we can plan a path that either:\n  - Avoids being on y=3,4,5 at T=66, by either being above or below at that turn, or\n  - Be on y=3,4,5 at a different turn.\n\nSince we want minimal turns, we want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nThe minimal time to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 turns (if we go up every turn). So we would be at:\n  T=62: y=0\n  T=63: y=1\n  T=64: y=2\n  T=65: y=3\n  T=66: y=4 -> but at T=66, we are on freeway4 -> which is dangerous (because freeway4 is dangerous at T=66). So we cannot be at y=4 at T=66.\n\nTherefore, we cannot take the direct path.\n\nWe have to avoid being at y=3,4,5 at T=66.\n\nOptions:\n  Option 1: Be below y=3 at T=66. For example, at T=66, be at y=2. Then we have to make up the difference later.\n  Option 2: Be above y=5 at T=66. For example, at T=66, be at y=6. Then we have to have reached y=6 by T=66.\n\nLet's compute the minimal H.\n\nFirst, if we go without waiting, we would be at:\n  T=62: y0=0\n  T=63: y1=1\n  T=64: y2=2\n  T=65: y3=3\n  T=66: y4=4 -> collision.\n\nSo we must alter the path.\n\nOne idea: at some turn, we wait (S) or even go down to avoid being at y=3,4,5 at T=66.\n\nBut note: we can also speed up? Actually, we can only move one step at most per turn.\n\nAlternative: we can slow down so that at T=66 we are at y=2. Then from T=66 onward we go up.\n\nBut then we would be at:\n  T=62: 0\n  T=63: 1\n  T=64: 2\n  T=65: 2 (stay) -> then at T=65 we are at y=2\n  T=66: 3 -> but then at T=66 we are at y=3 -> which is dangerous! because freeway3 is dangerous at T=66.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=3 either.\n\nWe must avoid y=3,4,5 at T=66.\n\nSo at T=66, we must be at y<=2 or y>=6.\n\nOption: at T=66, be at y=2.\n\nHow to get to y=2 at T=66? \n  We start at y=0 at T=62. We have 4 moves (from T=62 to T=65) to get to y=2? \n  Actually, from T=62 to T=63, T=64, T=65, T=66: we have 4 actions (at T=62,63,64,65) to determine the position at T=66.\n\n  The position at T=66 is determined by the actions at T=62,63,64,65.\n\n  We need: \n      y_62 = 0\n      y_63 = y_62 + a_62 (U: +1, D: -1, S:0) -> but cannot go below 0, but we are at 0 so D would keep at 0.\n      y_64 = y_63 + a_63\n      y_65 = y_64 + a_64\n      y_66 = y_65 + a_65\n\n  We want y_66 = 2? Actually, we want the position at T=66 to be 2? But note: the goal is to get to 9 eventually.\n\n  Alternatively, we can be at y=6 at T=66.\n\nLet me check the feasibility of being at y=6 at T=66:\n\n  From y=0 at T=62 to y=6 at T=66: that requires 6 moves up in 4 turns? \n      We have 4 moves: T62, T63, T64, T65 -> we can do at most 4 moves up -> y=4 at T66? \n      Actually: \n          T62: start at 0 -> then after T62: y=1 (if U) -> T63: y=1 -> then if U: T64: y=2 -> T65: y=3 -> T66: y=4 -> not 6.\n\n  So we cannot get to y=6 in 4 moves.\n\nTherefore, the only option is to be at y=0,1, or 2 at T=66.\n\nBut note: we cannot be at y=0 at T=66? Because we started at y=0 at T=62 and we want to go up. But we could stay? \n  We can do:\n      T62: S -> y=0\n      T63: S -> y=0\n      T64: S -> y=0\n      T65: S -> y=0\n      Then T66: y=0 -> safe (but we are still at 0, then we need 9 more moves to get to 9 -> total turns from T62: 1 (for T62) + 9 = 10? Actually, from T62 to T66 we are at 0, then we start moving.\n\n  This is safe but not minimal.\n\nAlternatively, we can get to y=2 at T=66:\n\n  We need: \n      y_62 = 0\n      Then we have 4 actions (at T62, T63, T64, T65) to get to y_66=2.\n\n  The net change is +2. We can do, for example: \n      T62: U -> y=1\n      T63: U -> y=2\n      T64: S -> y=2\n      T65: S -> y=2 -> then at T66: y=2 (by the action at T65: we stay -> so y_66 = 2)\n\n  But wait: the position at T66 is the result of the action at T65? \n      Actually, the state at T66 is after the action at T65: \n          at T65: we start at y_65, then we do an action -> then we get y_66 = y_65 + a_65.\n\n      So if at T65 we are at y_65=2 and we do S, then y_66=2.\n\n  So this is feasible.\n\n  Then from T66: we are at y=2. Then we need to go to y=9: that requires 7 moves up. So the total turns from T62: \n      T62: action (U) -> to 1\n      T63: action (U) -> to 2\n      T64: S -> still 2\n      T65: S -> still 2 (then at T66 we are at 2)\n      Then from T66 to T72: 7 moves up: \n          T66: U -> 3\n          T67: U -> 4\n          T68: U -> 5\n          T69: U -> 6\n          T70: U -> 7\n          T71: U -> 8\n          T72: U -> 9\n\n      So we reach at T72.\n\n      Total turns: from T62 to T72: 11 turns? Actually, the actions are from T62 to T71? \n          We start at T62: action at T62, T63, T64, T65, T66, T67, T68, T69, T70, T71 -> 10 actions -> then at T72 we are at 9.\n\n      But note: the sequence of actions: \n          T62: U -> at T63: y=1\n          T63: U -> at T64: y=2\n          T64: S -> at T65: y=2\n          T65: S -> at T66: y=2\n          T66: U -> at T67: y=3\n          T67: U -> at T68: y=4\n          T68: U -> at T69: y=5\n          T69: U -> at T70: y=6\n          T70: U -> at T71: y=7\n          T71: U -> at T72: y=8 -> wait, we need to get to 9.\n\n      We need one more: \n          T72: U -> at T73: y=9.\n\n      So 12 actions? \n\n      Actually, the number of turns: we start at T62 (state known). Then we do actions at T62, T63, ..., T72: that is 11 actions? \n          T62: action -> leads to state at T63\n          ...\n          T72: action -> leads to state at T73.\n\n      So at T73 we are at 9. Therefore, H = 11 turns? \n\n      But the problem says: the sequence of actions from t1 (62) to t1+H-1, and at the end of the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at 9.\n\n      So if we do 11 actions: at turn 62,63,...,72 -> then at the end of turn72 we are at 9.\n\n      So H=11.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nAnother option: at T=66, be at y=1? \n  Then we can do:\n      T62: U -> 1\n      T63: S -> 1\n      T64: S -> 1\n      T65: S -> 1 -> then at T66: y=1 (by doing S at T65: y_66 = y_65 + 0 = 1)\n\n  Then from T66: \n      T66: U -> 2\n      T67: U -> 3\n      ... until T73: U -> 9? \n          T66: 1->2\n          T67: 2->3\n          T68: 3->4\n          T69: 4->5\n          T70: 5->6\n          T71: 6->7\n          T72: 7->8\n          T73: 8->9\n\n      So 12 actions: from T62 to T73 -> 12 actions? Then H=12? That's worse.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid the danger by going down? But that would take even longer.\n\nBut note: we can also be at y=2 at T=66 and then go up. We have 11 actions.\n\nBut wait: what if we do not stay at y=2 for two turns? We can get to y=2 earlier and then wait? \n\nActually, we must avoid being at y=3,4,5 at T=66. But we can be at y=3,4,5 at other turns? Yes, because the danger is only at T=66.\n\nSo we could go up to y=5 by T=65? Then at T=66 we must not be at y=3,4,5 -> so we must move away? \n\nOption: \n  T62: U -> 1\n  T63: U -> 2\n  T64: U -> 3\n  T65: U -> 4 -> now at T65 we are at 4? Then at T66 we must not be at 4. So we can move down to 3? But then at T66 we are at 3 -> which is dangerous? \n      Because freeway3 is dangerous at T=66 -> so we cannot be at 3 at T=66.\n\n  Or move down to 3? Then we are at 3 at T66 -> dangerous.\n\n  Or move up to 5? Then we are at 5 at T66 -> dangerous.\n\n  Or stay? Then 4 -> dangerous.\n\n  So we cannot be at 4 at T65? Because then at T66 we have to move and we end up at 3,4,5 -> all dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, we can get to y=5 at T65? Then at T66 we can move down to 4? -> dangerous. Or to 5? -> dangerous. Or to 6? \n      If we do U at T65: then we go from 5 to 6? But we are at 5 at T65? Then we do U -> 6 at T66 -> safe.\n\nBut how to get to 5 at T65? \n      T62: 0 -> U: 1 at T63\n      T63: U: 2 at T64\n      T64: U: 3 at T65\n      T65: then we are at 3 at the start of T65? Then we do two moves in one turn? No, we can only do one.\n\n      Actually: \n          T62: U -> T63: y=1\n          T63: U -> T64: y=2\n          T64: U -> T65: y=3\n          Then at T65: we do U -> then at T66: y=4? -> dangerous.\n\n      How do we get to 5 at T65? We would need 5 moves from T62 to T65: that's 3 moves -> we can only get to 3.\n\nSo we cannot be at 5 at T65.\n\nWhat if we go faster? We can only do one per turn.\n\nAnother idea: at T66 we are at y=6? We saw that we cannot get to 6 in 4 moves (max 4 moves -> 4).\n\nBut wait: we could go up twice and then wait? Then we are at 2 at T64? Then we have two moves: T64 and T65 -> we can go up twice: 2->3->4 -> then at T66 we are at 4 -> dangerous.\n\nWe need to be at 6 at T66: \n      We have 4 moves: T62, T63, T64, T65 -> we need 6 moves up? Not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only safe option is to be at y<=2 at T66.\n\nBut we can be at y=0,1,2 at T66.\n\nThe best is to be as high as possible: y=2 at T66.\n\nThen the plan: \n  Actions:\n      T62: U -> to 1\n      T63: U -> to 2\n      T64: S -> stay at 2\n      T65: S -> stay at 2 (so at T66 we are at 2)\n      Then from T66 to T73: we go up 7 times? \n          T66: U -> 3\n          T67: U -> 4\n          T68: U -> 5\n          T69: U -> 6\n          T70: U -> 7\n          T71: U -> 8\n          T72: U -> 9\n\n      So at T73 we are at 9.\n\n      The actions are at T62, T63, T64, T65, T66, T67, T68, T69, T70, T71, T72 -> 11 actions.\n\n      So H=11.\n\nBut wait: at T67: we are at y=3 -> and T67 is 62+5? Then we are on freeway3 at T67. Is freeway3 dangerous at T67? \n  We computed that freeway3 is dangerous only at T=62 and T=66. T67 is safe? \n      For freeway3, car1: dangerous at T=66? Then at T=67: \n          car1: [ -59+12*(67-62), -48+12*(67-62) ] = [ -59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> doesn't include 0 -> safe.\n      car2: never dangerous.\n      car3: only dangerous at T=62 -> safe.\n\n  Similarly, freeway4 and 5: same.\n\nSo the path is safe.\n\nBut note: at T68 we are at y=4 -> freeway4: at T=68: \n      freeway4: car1: [ -59+12*(68-62) = -59+72 = 13, -48+72=24] -> doesn't include 0 -> safe.\n      car2: still not covering 0.\n      car3: [ -11+12*6, 0+12*6] = [61,72] -> no.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nThe sequence of actions (from turn 62 to turn 72):\n\n  Turn 62: U\n  Turn 63: U\n  Turn 64: S\n  Turn 65: S\n  Turn 66: U\n  Turn 67: U\n  Turn 68: U\n  Turn 69: U\n  Turn 70: U\n  Turn 71: U\n  Turn 72: U\n\nBut wait: we have 11 actions? And the last action at turn72 should lead to y=9? \n  Let me simulate:\n\n      t=62: start at 0, do U -> at t=63: 1\n      t=63: do U -> at t=64: 2\n      t=64: do S -> at t=65: 2\n      t=65: do S -> at t=66: 2\n      t=66: do U -> at t=67: 3\n      t=67: do U -> at t=68: 4\n      t=68: do U -> at t=69: 5\n      t=69: do U -> at t=70: 6\n      t=70: do U -> at t=71: 7\n      t=71: do U -> at t=72: 8\n      t=72: do U -> at t=73: 9\n\n  So we are at 9 at turn73. And we have done actions at turn62 to turn72: 11 actions.\n\n  The problem says: the sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1, and at the end of the last action we are at 9.\n\n  Here, t1=62, H=11, so t from 0 to 10: \n        t=0 -> turn62\n        t=1 -> turn63\n        ...\n        t=10 -> turn72.\n\n  Then at turn72 we do the last action (U) and then we are at 9 at the next state (turn73). But the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the turn when the last action is taken? \n\n  Actually, the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" meaning that after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9).\n\n  In our simulation: after the action at turn72, we are at (0,9) at the next state (turn73). But the problem says \"at turn T\" we are at the position after the action? \n\n  Let me read the update: \n      y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\n  So the position at time t+1 is after the action at time t.\n\n  Therefore, the position after the action at time t is at time t+1.\n\n  So to be at (0,9) at time t1+H, we need the last action to be at time t1+H-1.\n\n  So if we want to be at 9 at time T, then the last action was at time T-1.\n\n  In our case, we are at 9 at time 73. Therefore, the last action is at time 72. \n\n  And we started at time 62. The actions are at times 62,63,...,72: which is 11 actions. So H=11.\n\n  And the sequence is as above.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10? \n\n  Then we would be at 9 at turn 62+10 = 72. So the last action is at turn71, which leads to 9 at turn72.\n\n  How? We need to have 9 moves up? \n      Start at 0 at turn62.\n      After 9 moves: at turn71 we do the 9th move? Then we are at 9 at turn72.\n\n      But we have 10 actions? from turn62 to turn71: 10 actions.\n\n      The moves: we need to go from 0 to 9: 9 moves up and one wait? Or 9 moves up and one down? But that wouldn't help.\n\n      Actually, we need at least 9 moves up. So we must have at least 9 U actions. Then the other one action must be non-down? \n\n      But we have 10 actions: 9 U and one extra. That extra must be either S or D? \n\n      But if we do 9 U and one S: then we have 9 moves up and one stay -> we are at 9 at the end? \n          Example: \n              T62: U -> 1\n              T63: U -> 2\n              T64: U -> 3\n              T65: U -> 4\n              T66: U -> 5 -> but at T66 we are at 5? -> dangerous! because freeway5 at T66 is dangerous.\n\n          So we cannot be at 5 at T66.\n\n      How about avoiding T66? \n          We need to be at y=9 at turn72 (after the action at turn71). \n\n          The constraint is at T66: we must not be at y=3,4,5.\n\n          How can we arrange 9 U and one S in 10 actions without being at y=3,4,5 at T66?\n\n          Let me denote the actions from T62 to T71 (10 actions).\n\n          The position at T66: which is after the action at T65 (the 4th action, since T62 is 0-indexed: \n                actions: T62 (0), T63 (1), T64 (2), T65 (3), T66: state after T65 action.\n\n          We are at T66: y66 = initial0 + (number of U in first 4 actions) - (number of D in first 4 actions)\n\n          We require y66 not in {3,4,5}. \n\n          Also, we need the total number of U to be 9 and one S (so no D). \n\n          So the net move by T66: we have done 4 actions: let u4 be the number of U in the first 4 actions, then y66 = u4 (since we start at 0 and no D).\n\n          We require u4 <=2 or u4>=6? But u4 is at most 4 -> so we require u4<=2.\n\n          Then the remaining 6 actions (from T66 to T71: 6 actions) must provide 9 - u4 moves up? \n\n          We have 6 actions: we need 9 - u4 moves up. Since u4<=2, then 9-u4>=7. But we can only do at most 6 moves up in 6 actions -> so 9-u4 <=6 -> u4>=3. \n\n          Contradiction: u4 must be <=2 and >=3 -> impossible.\n\n      If we use one D: then we have 9 U and 1 D? Then net 8 moves up? Then we end at 8? not 9.\n\n      Or 10 U? Then we have 10 moves up? Then we would be at 10? but the grid only goes to 9 -> so we cannot go beyond 9. And the rule: y_{t+1} = min(9, max(0, y_t + Δy))? \n\n      Actually: \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\" -> so if we are at 9 and do U, we stay at 9? \n\n      But then we can do: \n          T62: U -> 1\n          T63: U -> 2\n          T64: U -> 3\n          T65: U -> 4 -> then at T66: we are at 4 -> dangerous.\n\n      How about: \n          T62: U -> 1\n          T63: U -> 2\n          T64: S -> 2\n          T65: U -> 3 -> then at T66: 3 -> dangerous.\n\n      Or:\n          T62: U -> 1\n          T63: U -> 2\n          T64: U -> 3 -> at T65: 3 -> then T65: D -> 2 -> then at T66: 2 (safe)\n          Then we have 7 more moves: we need to get to 9 from 2: that requires 7 moves up -> 7 moves: 2+7=9 -> so at T73 we are at 9? \n          But we have used 10 actions: T62 to T71? \n              T62: U -> 1\n              T63: U -> 2\n              T64: U -> 3\n              T65: D -> 2\n              T66: U -> 3\n              T67: U -> 4\n              T68: U -> 5\n              T69: U -> 6\n              T70: U -> 7\n              T71: U -> 8 -> then at T72 we are at 8? not 9.\n\n          Then we need one more: T72: U -> 9 at T73 -> so 11 actions.\n\n      Alternatively, use the D later? But we only have one D. \n\n      So it seems H=11 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, we choose the sequence:\n\n  Turn 62: U\n  Turn 63: U\n  Turn 64: S\n  Turn 65: S\n  Turn 66: U\n  Turn 67: U\n  Turn 68: U\n  Turn 69: U\n  Turn 70: U\n  Turn 71: U\n  Turn 72: U\n\nBut wait: we have 11 actions? The last action is at turn72. Then the next state is turn73 at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions for t=0 to H-1, and we are at (0,9) at the end of the last action.\n\nIn the update: after the action at time t, the next state is t+1. So after the action at turn72, we are at turn73. \n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at the turn when we are at (0,9). The turn is the time index. \n\nThe problem: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9)\" \n\nWhat is H? The minimal number of turns? \n\nThe problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nBut note: at the initial state (turn62) we are at (0,0). Then we take an action at turn62, which leads to turn63 at a new y.\n\nSo after H turns (meaning H actions), we are at turn62+H.\n\nAnd at turn62+H, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn our plan: after 11 actions, we are at turn62+11 = 73, at (0,9). So H=11.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". \n\nAlternatively, they might count the initial turn as turn0? But the problem says \"current turn is t1\", and then we do actions for H turns? \n\nSo H is the number of actions? \n\nThe problem: \"minimal number of turns H\" and the sequence is for t=0 to H-1 (which corresponds to actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1). \n\nSo H is the number of actions.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: U\nTurn 64: S\nTurn 65: S\nTurn 66: U\nTurn 67: U\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: U\n}\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn72, which is t1+10? \n    t1 = 62, \n    t1+0: 62\n    t1+1: 63\n    ...\n    t1+10: 72 -> so we have 11 actions? Yes, t from 0 to 10.\n\nSo the above sequence.\n\nBut wait: we have an alternative that might be the same length? \n\nWhat if we do not wait twice? We could do:\n\n  We want to avoid the danger at T66 by being at y=2 at T66. We can get to y=2 at T63? Then we wait at T64 and T65? That's what we did.\n\n  Or we can get to y=1 at T63, then at T64 we do S (stay at 1), then at T65 we do U -> then at T66 we are at 2? \n\n      Then:\n          T62: U -> 1\n          T63: S -> 1\n          T64: S -> 1\n          T65: U -> 2 -> then at T66: 2 (safe)\n          Then we need to go from 2 to 9: 7 moves: \n              T66: U -> 3\n              T67: U -> 4\n              ... until T72: U -> 8 -> then T73: 9? \n          Then we need one more: T73: U -> 9? \n          But we are at 8 at T73? Then T73: U -> 9 at T74.\n\n      So 12 actions: worse.\n\n  Or we can do:\n      T62: U -> 1\n      T63: U -> 2\n      T64: U -> 3 -> but then at T65: we have to avoid being at 3,4,5 at T66? \n          At T65 we are at 3. Then at T65 we do D -> 2 -> then at T66: 2 (safe)\n          Then from T66: U -> 3 at T67\n          Then we need 6 more moves: 3->4->...->9: 6 moves? 3+6=9 -> so at T72: we are at 8? Then T73: 9.\n\n      Actions: \n          T62: U -> 1\n          T63: U -> 2\n          T64: U -> 3\n          T65: D -> 2\n          T66: U -> 3\n          T67: U -> 4\n          T68: U -> 5\n          T69: U -> 6\n          T70: U -> 7\n          T71: U -> 8\n          T72: U -> 9 -> then at T73: 9.\n\n      But we have 11 actions: T62 to T72 -> same as before.\n\n      But in this sequence, we have one D? \n\n      However, the total moves: 10 U and 1 D -> net 9 moves? and we end at 9? \n          Actually: \n              T62: U: 1\n              T63: U: 2\n              T64: U: 3\n              T65: D: 2\n              T66: U: 3\n              T67: U: 4\n              T68: U: 5\n              T69: U: 6\n              T70: U: 7\n              T71: U: 8\n              T72: U: 9 -> at T73: 9.\n\n          But note: the last action (T72: U) is done at T72, and then at T73 we are at 9.\n\n      So same H=11.\n\n      But is this safe? \n          At T65: we are at y=2? Then we do D -> to 1? \n          But the rule: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and Δy_t for D is -1 -> so from 2 we go to 1? \n\n          Then at T66 we are at 1? But we planned to be at 2? \n\n          I see: I made a mistake: \n              At T65: we start at y=3 (from T64: we did U to 3 at T64? Then at T65 we are at 3). \n              Then we do D: so y_{66} = 3 - 1 = 2.\n\n          Then at T66 we are at 2? \n\n          And then we do U at T66: to 3 at T67.\n\n          So the sequence is safe? \n\n          But at T64: we are at y=3? and T64 = 62+2 = 64? Then we are on freeway3 at T64. Is freeway3 dangerous at T64? \n              We computed: freeway3 dangerous at T62 and T66. T64 is safe.\n\n          Then at T65: we are at y=2? freeway2: safe at T65 (because freeway2 only dangerous at T62). \n          Then at T66: we are at y=2? safe.\n\n          Then at T67: y=3? freeway3 at T67: safe (as before).\n\n      So this sequence is also safe and has the same length.\n\n      Which one to choose? Both have 11 actions. \n\n      The problem does not specify which sequence to choose as long as minimal H. \n\n      But note: we might prefer to avoid D? But the problem does not say. \n\n      However, the first sequence (with two S) has no D, which might be simpler.\n\n      But the problem says minimal H, and both have H=11.\n\n      We can choose either.\n\nBut wait: in the first sequence we did two S, and in the second we did one D and one more U? \n\n      First sequence: 9 U and 2 S -> 11 actions.\n      Second sequence: 10 U and 1 D -> 11 actions.\n\n      Both end at 9.\n\n      However, the second sequence goes to 3 at T64 and then down to 2 at T65? \n\n      But the goal is minimal H, so both are minimal.\n\n      Since the problem does not specify, we can choose the first one (with two S) to avoid moving down.\n\nBut let me check if there is a sequence with H=10? We saw it's impossible.\n\nTherefore, we output the first sequence.\n\nBut note: in the first sequence, at T64 and T65 we are at y=2. Is that safe? \n    T64: we are at y=2: freeway2 -> dangerous? \n        Freeway2: dangerous only at T=62 -> safe for T64 (which is 62+2).\n    T65: y=2: freeway2 -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: U\nTurn 64: S\nTurn 65: S\nTurn 66: U\nTurn 67: U\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: U\n}\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn72, and then at turn73 we are at 9. And we have 11 actions.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the state to be at (0,9) at the same turn as the last action, then we have a problem. But according to the update rule, the state after the action at turn t is at turn t+1.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" and the sequence of actions. And the minimal number of turns H. \n\nI think we have it right.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"the minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence for t=0 to H-1. \n\nSo H=11.\n\nOne more thing: the problem says \"avoiding collisions\", and we have checked the dangerous turns: only at T66 on freeways 3,4,5 we have to avoid, and we are not there at T66.\n\nAnd at other times and freeways, we are safe.\n\nSo we are done.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 62\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on freeways 3, 4, or 5 at turn 66, the only dangerous turn for those freeways. The actions are as follows:\n\n- At turn 62, move up to \\(y = 1\\).\n- At turn 63, move up to \\(y = 2\\).\n- At turn 64, stay to remain at \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as freeway 2 is only dangerous at turn 62).\n- At turn 65, stay to remain at \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as freeway 2 is only dangerous at turn 62).\n- At turn 66, move up to \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as freeways 3, 4, and 5 are dangerous at turn 66, but the player is at \\(y = 2\\) at the start of turn 66 and moves to \\(y = 3\\) at the end, avoiding the danger).\n- From turns 67 to 72, move up each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 73.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) in 11 turns, with the last action at turn 72 resulting in the position \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 73.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 62: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 63: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 64: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 65: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 66: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 67: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 68: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 69: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 70: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 71: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 72: \\text{U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The current turn is t_1 = 66, and I start at y=0.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For left-moving cars, the span moves left as time increases, and for right-moving, it moves right. The collision happens only if at turn T, when I'm on freeway y_T, the x=0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nImportant point: when I move to a new freeway, at turn T, I'm still on the previous freeway, so I only check for collision on the freeway I'm currently on at that turn. When I decide to move at turn T, I change position at turn T+1, so during turn T, I'm on y_T, and I might move to y_{T+1} at the end of the turn.\n\nLet me read carefully:\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and I only care about cars on that freeway at that exact turn. When I take an action, it affects my position for the next turn.\n\nActions: U (up, y increases by 1), D (down, y decreases by 1), S (stay, y same).\n\ny is from 0 to 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9. Starting from y=0, if I go down, I stay at 0, I assume, since y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so D at y=0 keeps me at 0.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, U would keep me at 9.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9.\n\nNow, freeways are y=1 to 8, each with cars.\n\nCars are given for each freeway k, with a list of cars: (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: left or right.\n\nSpeed: units per turn, I assume.\n\nSpan: for left-moving, head and tail, with head > tail I think, since it moves left.\n\nLet's see the update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nBut 48 and 83, if it's left-moving, and head at 48, tail at 83? That would imply tail > head, but when it moves left, head decreases, tail decreases.\n\nBut in terms of position, if tail > head, that might mean the car is oriented such that tail is to the right, but since it's moving left, the left end should be smaller.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook at freeway 3: (48,37, right,12), and for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the list, for right-moving, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for right, head should be the front, so for right-moving, head > tail, I assume.\n\nIn freeway 3, (48,37, right,12), so head=48, tail=37, since it's moving right, so at T, span is [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [37 + 12ΔT, 48 + 12ΔT], so tail end at left, head at right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 1: (48,83, left,36), head=48, tail=83. Since moving left, head should be left end? But 48 < 83, so if head=48, tail=83, and moving left, the span should be [h, τ] but h=48, τ=83, so [48,83], and when moving left, both decrease, so at T, [48 - sΔT, 83 - sΔT].\n\nBut at t1, ΔT=0, so [48,83] at t1=66.\n\nBut x=0 is the position we care about, and cars are on the freeway, so for collision, at turn T, on freeway k, if 0 is between the left and right ends of any car.\n\nFor a car, the span covers from min to max position.\n\nIn the left-moving case, with head=48, tail=83, since tail > head, the left end is head=48, right end is tail=83? But when it moves left, both decrease, so left end decreases.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's define the position.\n\nFor a car, the span is the set of x positions it occupies.\n\nAt time t, for left-moving car, x_left(t) = h - s(t - t1)\n\nx_right(t) = τ - s(t - t1)\n\nThen span is [min(x_left, x_right), max(x_left, x_right)] but since it's moving left, x_left and x_right both decrease, and if h < τ, then x_left < x_right, so span is [x_left, x_right].\n\nIn freeway 1, h=48, τ=83, so at t1, x_left=48, x_right=83, span [48,83].\n\nAs t increases, both decrease at rate s=36.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: x_left(t) = τ + s(t - t1)\n\nx_right(t) = h + s(t - t1)\n\nAnd if τ < h, x_left < x_right, span [x_left, x_right].\n\nIn freeway 3, first car: (48,37, right,12), so τ=37, h=48, so x_left(t) = 37 + 12(t-t1), x_right(t) = 48 + 12(t-t1), so [37 +12ΔT, 48+12ΔT]\n\nNow, collision when at turn T, for freeway y_T, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nAlso, multiple cars per freeway, I need to check all.\n\nNow, current turn t1=66, player at (0,0).\n\nI need to go to (0,9), so I need to move up through freeways 1 to 8 to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, I think, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0, no cars, similarly at y=9, no cars, I assume.\n\nThe grid has y=0 to 9, freeways with cars are y=1 to 8.\n\nSo at y=0 and y=9, no cars, so no collision possible there.\n\nBut at turn when I am on y=0, I don't care about cars, since no freeway there. Similarly for y=9.\n\nThe collision is only for freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nSo, when I am on y=0 or y=9, no collision risk.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=0, I need to pass through y=1 to 8.\n\nEach move, I can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nI need to minimize turns, so I should move up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nSince I start at turn 66, y=0, and I need to be at y=9.\n\nLet me denote ΔT = t - t1 = t - 66, so at ΔT=0, t=66, y=0.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions for t=66,67,68,... until I reach y=9.\n\nLet me find for each freeway and for each turn, whether x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nFirst, for each freeway k=1 to 8, and for each car, find when 0 is in the span.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need the times when for that freeway, no car has 0 in span, so it is safe to be on that freeway at that turn.\n\nFor each freeway, I can find the set of turns T where it is unsafe, i.e., collision would occur if on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThen, for my path, I need that for each turn, when I am on a freeway y_t, that turn T is not unsafe for y_t.\n\nSince I move step by step, I need to sequence the actions.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (48,83,left,36)\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (48,83,left,36) same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: same as freeway 3? (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: same as above: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (48,37,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (48,37,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (48,37,right,6), (0,-11,right,6)\n\nNow, for each, find for which T, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nFirst, define ΔT = T - t1 = T - 66.\n\nFor freeway 1: car (48,83,left,36)\n\nSpan at T: [48 - 36ΔT, 83 - 36ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 48 - 36ΔT <= 0 <= 83 - 36ΔT\n\nSince 48 - 36ΔT <= 0 when 36ΔT >= 48, so ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so ΔT >= 2 since turns are integer? ΔT is integer, T integer.\n\nT is turn number, so ΔT integer.\n\nSo 48 - 36ΔT <= 0 when ΔT >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = 2? 48/36=4/3≈1.333, ceil(1.333)=2, but let's compute inequality.\n\n48 - 36ΔT <= 0 ⇒ 36ΔT >= 48 ⇒ ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so for ΔT >= 2 since ΔT integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 83 - 36ΔT ⇒ 36ΔT <= 83 ⇒ ΔT <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so ΔT <= 2.\n\nSo 48 - 36ΔT <= 0 <= 83 - 36ΔT only if both inequalities hold.\n\nΔT >= ceil(48/36) and ΔT <= floor(83/36)\n\n48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, ceil(1.333) = 2\n\n83/36 ≈ 2.305, floor(2.305) = 2\n\nSo for ΔT=2, we have 48 - 36*2 = 48 - 72 = -24 <= 0, and 83 - 72 = 11 >= 0? 0 <= 11 is true, but -24 <= 0 <= 11? 0 is between -24 and 11, yes.\n\nFor ΔT=1: 48 - 36*1 = 12, 83 - 36 = 47, so [12,47], 0 not in [12,47]\n\nΔT=3: 48-108= -60, 83-108= -25, [-60,-25], 0 not in\n\nSo only at ΔT=2, 0 is in span for freeway 1.\n\nΔT=2, T = t1 + 2 = 68.\n\nNow freeway 2: same car, (48,83,left,36), so same as freeway 1, unsafe only at ΔT=2, T=68.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving: x_left(t) = τ + s ΔT = 37 + 12 ΔT\n\nx_right(t) = h + s ΔT = 48 + 12 ΔT\n\nSpan: [37 +12ΔT, 48 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 37 +12ΔT <= 0 <= 48 +12ΔT\n\nBut 37 +12ΔT >=37 >0 for ΔT>=0, so left end always positive, so 0 <= left end only if left end <=0, but left end min when ΔT min, but ΔT=0, 37>0, so always 37+12ΔT >0, so 0 < left end, so 0 not in [left, right] since left >0. Thus, for this car, 0 never in span.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,12)\n\nh=12, τ=1, right-moving\n\nx_left = τ + s ΔT = 1 + 12 ΔT\n\nx_right = h + s ΔT = 12 + 12 ΔT\n\nSpan [1+12ΔT, 12+12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 1+12ΔT <= 0 <= 12+12ΔT\n\n1+12ΔT <=0 ⇒ 12ΔT <= -1, impossible since ΔT>=0, so never true. Thus 0 not in span for this car.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nh=-24? Head and tail.\n\nGiven as (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, x_left = τ + s ΔT = -35 + 12 ΔT\n\nx_right = h + s ΔT = -24 + 12 ΔT\n\nSpan [ -35 +12ΔT, -24 +12ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -35 +12ΔT <= 0 <= -24 +12ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -35 +12ΔT <=0 ⇒ 12ΔT <=35 ⇒ ΔT <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so ΔT <=2\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -24 +12ΔT ⇒ 12ΔT >=24 ⇒ ΔT >= 2\n\nSo both: ΔT >=2 and ΔT <=2, so only ΔT=2.\n\nAt ΔT=2, x_left = -35 + 24 = -11, x_right = -24 + 24 = 0, so span [-11, 0], so 0 is included, yes.\n\nFor other ΔT, not both true.\n\nSo for freeway 3, only the third car has 0 in span at ΔT=2, T=68.\n\nThus freeway 3 unsafe at ΔT=2.\n\nNow freeway 4: same cars as freeway 3, so also unsafe only at ΔT=2.\n\nFreeway 5: same, unsafe at ΔT=2.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car (48,37,right,6)\n\nRight-moving, h=48, τ=37\n\nx_left = τ + s ΔT = 37 + 6 ΔT\n\nx_right = h + s ΔT = 48 + 6 ΔT\n\nSpan [37+6ΔT, 48+6ΔT]\n\nAlways positive, min 37>0, so 0 never in span. Safe for all T.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: same car (48,37,right,6), similarly, 37+6ΔT >=37>0, so always safe.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6), same as above, always safe.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6)\n\nh=0, τ=-11, right-moving\n\nx_left = τ + s ΔT = -11 + 6 ΔT\n\nx_right = h + s ΔT = 0 + 6 ΔT = 6 ΔT\n\nSpan [ -11 +6ΔT, 6ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -11 +6ΔT <= 0 <= 6ΔT\n\nFirst: -11 +6ΔT <=0 ⇒ 6ΔT <=11 ⇒ ΔT <= 11/6 ≈1.833, so ΔT <=1\n\nSecond: 0 <= 6ΔT ⇒ ΔT >=0, always true for ΔT>=0.\n\nSo both: ΔT <=1 and ΔT >=0, so for ΔT=0 and ΔT=1.\n\nAt ΔT=0: span [-11, 0], 0 included.\n\nAt ΔT=1: x_left = -11 +6= -5, x_right=6, span [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nAt ΔT=2: x_left = -11 +12=1, x_right=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 8, second car causes unsafe at ΔT=0 and ΔT=1.\n\nFirst car is safe, but second car makes it unsafe at ΔT=0 and 1.\n\nΔT=0: T=t1=66\n\nΔT=1: T=67\n\nSo freeway 8 unsafe at T=66 and T=67.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, unsafe turns (relative to t1=66):\n\ny=1: unsafe at ΔT=2 (T=68)\n\ny=2: unsafe at ΔT=2 (T=68)\n\ny=3: unsafe at ΔT=2 (T=68)\n\ny=4: unsafe at ΔT=2 (T=68)\n\ny=5: unsafe at ΔT=2 (T=68)\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: unsafe at ΔT=0 (T=66), ΔT=1 (T=67)\n\nNow, I start at t=66, y=0.\n\nAt turn t, I am on y_t.\n\nAt turn T, if I am on a freeway (y=1-8), it must be safe, i.e., not unsafe at that T.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at t=66, which is not a freeway, so no issue.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is also safe.\n\nNow, actions: at each turn, I choose U, D, or S, changing y for next turn.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9, with min turns.\n\nThe minimal number of turns would be 9, if I go up every turn, but I might need to avoid unsafe times.\n\nSince I can stay or even go down, but that would increase turns, so probably I want to go up as much as possible, but avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nNow, the unsafe events:\n\nAt T=68, freeways y=1,2,3,4,5 are all unsafe. y=6 and 7 are safe, but y=8 is unsafe only at T=66 and 67, which are before.\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=66 and 67, but since we start at t=66, and we might not be on y=8 at that time.\n\nI need to plan the sequence.\n\nLet me denote the turn from t=66 onwards.\n\nAt turn t=66: I am at y=0. I can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I choose U, at next turn t=67, I will be at y=1.\n\nSimilarly, S: stay at y=0 for t=67.\n\nD: stay at y=0 since y=0 min.\n\nBut since I want to go up, D might not be useful, except to avoid something, but y=0 is safe, so I can stay or go up.\n\nSimilarly, at other points.\n\nNow, the critical point is around T=68.\n\nAt T=68, y=1 to 5 are unsafe, so I should not be on y=1,2,3,4,5 at turn 68.\n\ny=6 and 7 are safe at all times.\n\ny=8 is unsafe at t=66 and 67, but at t=68, it is safe, since for y=8, unsafe only at ΔT=0,1, so at T=68, ΔT=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, before and after.\n\nI start at t=66, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=6 and 7 are always safe, and y=8 is safe after t=67, i.e., from t=68 onwards.\n\ny=8 unsafe only at t=66 and 67, so for t>=68, safe.\n\nNow, to go from y=0 to y=9, min 9 moves up, but I might need to delay or something.\n\nBut at t=68, if I am on y=1 to 5, I crash.\n\nSo I need to not be on y=1,2,3,4,5 at turn 68.\n\nThat means, at turn 68, I should be on y=0, or y=6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, I might not be there yet.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nSuppose I start moving up.\n\nAt t=66: I am at y=0. I can choose U, so at t=67, y=1.\n\nBut at t=67, if I am on y=1, is it safe? For y=1, unsafe only at t=68, not at t=67.\n\nAt t=67, what is y=1?\n\nFor freeway 1, at ΔT=1, T=67, we had span [12,47], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 same.\n\ny=3: at ΔT=1, T=67, let's see.\n\nFor y=3, at ΔT=1, cars: first car span [37+12,48+12]=[49,60] not 0\n\nSecond car [1+12,12+12]=[13,24] not 0\n\nThird car [-35+12, -24+12]=[-23,-12] not contain 0\n\nSo safe at ΔT=1.\n\nSimilarly all y=1-5 safe at t=67 except y=8 unsafe at t=67.\n\nBut y=8 is different.\n\nAt t=67, freeways:\n\ny=1: safe, as above\n\ny=2: same, safe\n\ny=3: safe\n\netc.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=67.\n\nBack to sequence.\n\nOption: at t=66, I go U, so at t=67, I am at y=1.\n\nNow at t=67, I am on y=1, which is safe at t=67.\n\nI need to choose action for t=67.\n\nIf I go U again, at t=68, I would be at y=2.\n\nBut at t=68, y=2 is unsafe, crash.\n\nSo I cannot go U from y=1 at t=67, because then at t=68 I am on y=2, unsafe.\n\nI could go S, stay at y=1 for t=68, but at t=68, y=1 is unsafe, so if I stay, at turn t=68, I am on y=1, which is unsafe, crash.\n\nSimilarly, if I go D, to y=0, but at t=68, I would be on y=0, which is safe, no freeway.\n\nBut y=0 is not a freeway, so safe.\n\nAt t=67, I am at y=1 (after action from t=66).\n\nAt turn t=67, I choose action.\n\nIf I choose S: then at t=68, I am still on y=1. But at turn t=68, on y=1, unsafe, crash.\n\nIf I choose U: at t=68, I am on y=2, unsafe, crash.\n\nIf I choose D: at t=68, I am on y=0, which is safe.\n\nSo only safe choice is to go down to y=0 at t=67, so at t=68 I am on y=0.\n\nBut I was at y=1 at t=67, go D, to y=0 at t=68.\n\nThen I have to start over or something.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nFrom t=66, instead of going up immediately, I could stay or something.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAt t=66, I am at y=0.\n\nIf I choose S: at t=67, I am still at y=0.\n\nThen at t=67, I can go U to y=1 at t=68.\n\nBut at t=68, if I am on y=1, unsafe.\n\nIf at t=67 I go U, to y=1 at t=68, unsafe.\n\nIf at t=67 I go S, stay at y=0 at t=68, safe but not progressing.\n\nThen later I can go up, but at t=68, y=1-5 unsafe, so I need to avoid being on them at t=68.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=6 or 7 at t=68.\n\ny=6 and 7 are safe at all times.\n\nBut to be on y=6 at t=68, I need to have moved up faster.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=66, to y=6 at t=68, that would require moving up 6 steps in 2 turns? Impossible.\n\nEach turn, I can change y by at most 1, so from t=66 to t=68, I can be at y=0,1, or 2 only.\n\nAfter two turns, from start, at t=67, y can be 0 or 1; at t=68, y can be 0,1,2.\n\nBut at t=68, y=0,1,2 are: y=0 safe, y=1 and 2 unsafe.\n\nSo only possible to be at y=0 at t=68 without crashing.\n\nIf I am at y=0 at t=68, I can start moving up later.\n\nBut that delays.\n\nI could be on y=6 or higher at t=68, but impossible in two turns.\n\nMinimal y at t=68 is 0, max is 2.\n\nSince y=6 and 7 are safe, I need to reach them after t=68 or before, but before t=68, I might not be able to.\n\nt=68 is the critical turn.\n\nSince y=1-5 are unsafe only at t=68, not at other times, so I can be on them before or after, just not at t=68.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 is unsafe at t=66 and 67, so I should not be on y=8 at t=66 or 67.\n\nBut t=66 is now, I am at y=0, so not on y=8.\n\nt=67, if I were on y=8, but I start from low, so probably not.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should go up as fast as possible except avoiding the unsafe turn.\n\nBut at t=68, I must not be on y=1-5.\n\nSo I need to be either below or above at that turn.\n\nBelow means y=0, above means y=6 or more.\n\nBut since I start from y=0, at t=68, y=6 is impossible.\n\nSo only choice is to be at y=0 at t=68.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nBut being at y=0 at t=68 means I wasted some turns.\n\nFor example, at t=66: I start at y=0.\n\nIf I go S, at t=67 y=0.\n\nThen at t=67, I go S again, at t=68 y=0.\n\nThen at t=68, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nThen I can start going up.\n\nAt t=68, I go U, to y=1 at t=69.\n\nNow t=69, ΔT=3.\n\nAt t=69, what about the freeways?\n\nFirst, for y=1 to 5, unsafe only at t=68, so at t=69, they are safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 unsafe only at t=66,67, so at t=69 safe.\n\ny=6 and 7 always safe.\n\nSo from t=69 onwards, all freeways are safe at all times, since the unsafe events are only at specific times.\n\ny=1 unsafe only at t=68, so after that safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nOnly y=8 had unsafe at t=66,67, so after t=67 safe.\n\nAt t=69, all good.\n\nSo from y=0 at t=68, I can go up every turn to y=9.\n\nFrom t=68: at y=0\n\nt=68: action U, to y=1 at t=69\n\nt=69: at y=1, action U, to y=2 at t=70\n\n...\n\nUp to t=77: at y=9? Let's see:\n\nStart at t=68, y=0\n\nAfter action at t=68: U, to y=1 at t=69\n\nAt t=69, on y=1, action U, to y=2 at t=70\n\nAt t=70, on y=2, U to y=3 at t=71\n\n...\nAt t=75, on y=7, U to y=8 at t=76\n\nAt t=76, on y=8, U to y=9 at t=77\n\nAt t=77, on y=9, which is the goal.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 at some turn, and the turn when we are at y=9.\n\nAt t=77, after action, we are at y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions until we reach y=9.\n\nIn this case, from t=68 to t=76, we do U each time, reaching y=9 at t=77.\n\nBut at t=68, we are at y=0, and we start acting from there.\n\nNow, before that, from t=66 to t=68, we stayed at y=0.\n\nt=66: action? At t=66, we choose action to go to next y.\n\nAt t=66: we are at y=0, we choose S, so at t=67, y=0.\n\nAt t=67: we are at y=0, choose S, so at t=68, y=0.\n\nThen from t=68: U to y=1 at t=69, etc.\n\nTotal turns from start: we reach y=9 at t=77.\n\nBut t_1 =66, so ΔT=11, from t=66 to t=76 actions? Let's list the turns.\n\nTurn t: at the beginning of turn t, we are at position, then we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t.\n\nAt turn t, we are at (0, y_t), choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAfter H turns, we have y_{t_1 + H} =9, I think.\n\nLet's see the task.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n\"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t= t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter applying these actions, at turn t_1 + H, we have y_{t_1 + H}? No.\n\nStart: at turn t_1, we are at y_{t_1} =0.\n\nWe apply a_{t_1}, which sets y_{t_1 +1}\n\nThen apply a_{t_1 +1}, sets y_{t_1 +2}, and so on, up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which sets y_{t_1 + H}\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThe position after H actions is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut the sequence is for actions at turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn the answer format, it says Turn t: a_t, for t from t_1 to some.\n\nFor example, to reach at turn T, with y_T=9.\n\nIn this case, with staying: at t=66, y=0.\n\nAction at t=66: S, so y_{67} =0\n\nAction at t=67: S, so y_{68} =0\n\nAction at t=68: U, so y_{69} =1\n\nAction at t=69: U, so y_{70} =2\n\n...\n\nAction at t=75: U, so y_{76} =8\n\nAction at t=76: U, so y_{77} =9\n\nSo y_{77} =9, so we reached at turn t=77.\n\nActions from t=66 to t=76, H=11 actions? t from 66 to 76 inclusive is 11 turns? t=66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76: that's 11 actions.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, with H=11, t=0 to 10, actions at t_1=66 to 76.\n\ny_{t_1 + H} = y_{66+11} = y_{77} =9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut H=11 turns.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nSince y=6 and 7 are always safe, if I can be on y=6 at t=68, but from y=0 at t=66, in two turns, I can be at y=2 max, not y=6.\n\nImpossible.\n\nI could go up to y=5 before t=68, but at t=68 I need not to be on y=1-5.\n\nSo I need to be below y=1 or above y=5 at t=68.\n\nBelow: y=0\n\nAbove: y=6 or more, impossible.\n\nSo must be at y=0 at t=68.\n\nBut y=0 is fine.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=8 or something, but no, I start from below.\n\nAnother idea: since y=8 is unsafe at t=67, but I might not reach there.\n\nFor example, if I could be on y=6 at t=67, but from t=66 y=0, at t=67 I can be y=1 max.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo the earliest I can be at y=9 is if I go up continuously from some point.\n\nWith delay, at t=68 y=0, then up each turn to y=9 at t=77.\n\nt=77 is t_1 +11, since t_1=66, 77-66=11.\n\nBut t_1 + H =77, so H=11.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn count.\n\nStart: turn t_1=66, position y=0.\n\nAfter action a_66, y_67 set.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H -1}, y_{t_1 + H} set to 9.\n\nSo the last action is at turn t_1 + H -1, setting y_{t_1 + H}=9.\n\nIn this case, a_{76} sets y_{77}=9.\n\nActions from t=66 to t=76, 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut is there a way with less?\n\nSuppose at t=66, I go U, to y=1 at t=67.\n\nAt t=67, I am on y=1.\n\nIf I go D, to y=0 at t=68.\n\nThen at t=68, y=0, safe.\n\nThen same as before, from t=68 go up.\n\nBut at t=67, I went from y=1 to y=0, so I wasted one up and one down, but net no progress.\n\nCompared to staying at y=0 both turns.\n\nIn terms of sequence: if at t=66: U, so y_67=1\n\nAt t=67: D, so y_68=0\n\nThen same as before from t=68.\n\nBut I used actions U and D, whereas in stay, I used S S, but still, at t=68 I am at y=0.\n\nThen from t=68 U, etc.\n\nBut I reach y=9 at same time t=77, with y_77=9.\n\nBut in this case, I have an extra move: at t=67 I went to y=1 and back, but the position at t=68 is same, and I use two actions to stay at y=0 effectively.\n\nNo better.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nSuppose I go up to y=5 before t=68.\n\nFor example, at t=66: U to y_67=1\n\nAt t=67: U to y_68=2? But at t=68, if y=2, unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nAt t=67, if I stay at y=1, but at t=68 y=1 unsafe.\n\nOr go down.\n\nNo way to be above y=5 at t=68.\n\nSo must be at y=0 at t=68.\n\nThen from there, min turns to y=9 is 9 actions: from y=0 to y=1, ..., to y=9 in 9 moves, 9 actions.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=68, after first action U at t=68, y_69=1\n\nThen U at t=69, y_70=2\n\n...\n\nU at t=75, y_76=8? Let's see:\n\nt=68: y=0, action U, y_69=1\n\nt=69: y=1, action U, y_70=2\n\nt=70: y=2, U, y_71=3\n\nt=71: y=3, U, y_72=4\n\nt=72: y=4, U, y_73=5\n\nt=73: y=5, U, y_74=6\n\nt=74: y=6, U, y_75=7\n\nt=75: y=7, U, y_76=8\n\nt=76: y=8, U, y_77=9\n\nSo y_77=9, same as before.\n\nIf I start from t=68 y=0, to y_77=9, with actions from t=68 to t=76.\n\nBut before that, from t=66 to t=67, I need to be at y=0 at t=68.\n\nWith two actions: either S at t=66 and S at t=67, or U and D, but both result in y_68=0 with two actions.\n\nSo total H=11 actions to reach at t=77.\n\nBut perhaps I can save one turn by going to y=9 earlier, but I don't see how.\n\nAnother thought: since y=6 and 7 are safe, and I can be on them at t=68 if I were higher, but I start low.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=8 after t=67.\n\ny=8 is unsafe at t=67, but safe after.\n\nBut I need to reach y=8.\n\nFor example, if I could be at y=5 at t=67, then at t=67 I go U to y=6 at t=68, but at t=68, y=6 is safe.\n\nBut can I be at y=5 at t=67?\n\nAt t=67, y=5.\n\nFrom start t=66 y=0, to t=67 y=5, impossible, since each turn max increase 1.\n\nAt t=67, y can be at most 1.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 11, with sequence: stay at y=0 for t=66 and t=67, then up each turn to t=76.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at t=66 and t=67 are S, then from t=68 to t=76 are U.\n\nt=76 action U sets y_77=9.\n\nActions from t=66 to t=76, 11 actions.\n\nBut let's list:\n\nTurn 66: S\n\nTurn 67: S\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nThen y_77=9.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 76 is included, action U.\n\nNow, but we need to make sure that during the path, no collision.\n\nIn this path:\n\nAt turn t=66: on y=0, no freeway, safe.\n\nAction S, so y_67=0\n\nt=67: on y=0, safe, action S, y_68=0\n\nt=68: on y=0, safe, action U, so y_69=1\n\nt=69: on y=1, now freeway 1. At t=69, ΔT=3, which is safe, as earlier. Action U, y_70=2\n\nt=70: on y=2, freeway 2. ΔT=4, for y=2, car at [48-36*4, 83-36*4] = [48-144,83-144]=[-96,-61], 0 not in, safe. Action U, y_71=3\n\nt=71: on y=3, freeway 3. ΔT=5, cars: first [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] no, second [1+60,12+60]=[61,72] no, third [-35+60,-24+60]=[25,36] no, safe. Action U, y_72=4\n\nSimilarly, all safe as we go up.\n\nAt t=76: on y=8, freeway 8. At t=76, ΔT=10, for y=8, first car (48,37,right,6), span [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] no 0, second car (0,-11,right,6), span [-11+60, 0+60]=[49,60] no 0, safe. Action U to y=9.\n\nThen at t=77, on y=9, goal.\n\nAll safe.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nSuppose I go up immediately but avoid the crash at t=68 by being at y=0, but I have to be there.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=6 directly after, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=8 is unsafe at t=67, but if I am not there, fine.\n\nBut I don't gain time.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up later, but I start at t=66.\n\nAt t=66, if I go U to y=1 at t=67.\n\nThen at t=67, on y=1, instead of going down, I could go up to y=2 at t=68, but unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nOr, at t=67, I go S, but at t=68 on y=1 unsafe.\n\nNo choice but to go down or something.\n\nBut going down wastes a move.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 in fewer than 11 turns.\n\nMinimal possible: from y=0 to y=9, min 9 actions, but I need to avoid the unsafe turn, which forces me to stay at y=0 for two turns, so 9+2=11.\n\nIf I could be at y=1 at t=67 and stay safe, but at t=68 I must not be on y=1, so I have to move away.\n\nBut moving to y=0 or y=2, y=2 unsafe, so only y=0.\n\nThus, I must spend at least two turns at the beginning to be at y=0 at t=68, then 9 turns to go up, total 11 actions.\n\nPerhaps I can go up faster in some other way, but no.\n\nWhat about the cars on y=6,7,8? But they are safe except for y=8 at early times, but since I go there later, fine.\n\nIn the path above, it works with H=11.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose at t=66, I do nothing, but same.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=8 at t=68 or something, but impossible.\n\ny=8 at t=68: from y=0 at t=66, in two turns, max y=2.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let me see the car on y=8 at t=67 unsafe, but I am not there.\n\nIn the sequence, when I go to y=8 at t=76, it is safe.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have actions from t=66 to t=76.\n\nBut t_1=66.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 66: S\n\nTurn 67: S\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nBut H=11, from t=66 to 76.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write the turn numbers.\n\nSince t_1=66.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 66: S\n\nTurn 67: S\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut I need to make sure that at turn 76, when I am on y=8, and I go U to y=9, which is fine.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose I reach y=9 at t=76.\n\nThen y_76=9.\n\nThat means at turn 75, y_75=8 or 9, but if y_75=9, then at turn 75, I am at y=9, but I need to reach at some turn, but the position is after actions.\n\ny_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nSo to have y_{76}=9, for example.\n\nThen actions from t=66 to t=75, H=10 actions.\n\ny_{66 + H} = y_{76} =9.\n\nNow, at turn 75, what position? y_{75} must be 8 or 9, and action to set y_{76}=9.\n\nIf y_{75}=8, action U; if y_{75}=9, action S or U, but U would go to 10, not possible, so if y_{75}=9, action S to keep at 9.\n\nBut to reach earlier, probably y_{75}=8, action U.\n\nNow, y_{76}=9 at turn 76.\n\nBut turn 76 is earlier than 77.\n\nNow, with H=10, actions from t=66 to t=75.\n\ny_{76}=9.\n\nNow, y_{76}=9 means that at turn 75, we set y_{76}=9, so at turn 75, we were at y_{75}, and did action to set y_{76}=9.\n\nSince y_{76}=9, and y_{75} must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_{75}=8, we did U; if y_{75}=9, we did S, but if we are already at 9, we can stay, but to reach for the first time, but the task is to reach, so if we reach earlier, better.\n\nBut in this case, to have y_{76}=9, we need to be at y=8 or 9 at turn 75.\n\nTurn 75 is t=75.\n\nt_1=66, so turn 75 is t_1 +9.\n\ny_{75} must be set by action at t=74.\n\nNow, at turn 68, we must be at y=0 to avoid crash.\n\ny at turn 68: y_{68}.\n\ny_{68} must be 0, as we must not be on y=1-5 at t=68.\n\nNow, from turn 66 to turn 68: two actions, to set y_{67} and y_{68}.\n\ny_{66}=0.\n\nAfter action at t=66, y_{67} = y_{66} + Δy, so y_{67} can be 0 or 1.\n\nThen after action at t=67, y_{68} = y_{67} + Δy.\n\ny_{68} must be 0.\n\nSo if y_{67}=0, then to have y_{68}=0, action S or D.\n\nIf y_{67}=1, then to have y_{68}=0, action D.\n\nIn both cases, with two actions, we set y_{68}=0.\n\nThen from y_{68}=0, we need to reach y_{76}=9 in the remaining actions.\n\nFrom turn 68 to turn 75, we have actions at t=68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75: that's 8 actions.\n\nFrom y_{68}=0, after 8 actions, y_{76} = y_{68} + net up moves.\n\nEach action can increase y by at most 1, so after 8 actions, y_{76} <= 0 + 8 =8.\n\nBut we need y_{76}=9, which is 9, impossible with 8 actions from y=0.\n\nMax y_{76} = y_{68} + 8 = 0 + 8 =8.\n\nBut we need y_{76}=9, so impossible with H=10.\n\nIf we want y_{75}=9, then with actions to t=74, setting y_{75}=9.\n\nBut y_{75}=9, set at turn 74.\n\nThen from y_{68}=0 to y_{75}=9 in actions from t=68 to t=74, 7 actions? Actions at t=68 to t=74 inclusive: 7 actions (68,69,70,71,72,73,74).\n\ny_{75} = result after action at t=74.\n\nFrom y_{68}=0, after 7 actions, max y_{75} = 0 +7 =7, cannot reach 9.\n\nSimilarly, for any earlier.\n\nThus, minimal to reach y=9 is from y=0 in 9 actions, but since we have to be at y=0 at t=68, and t=68 is after two actions from start, we need the two actions to stay at 0, then 9 actions to go up, total 11 actions, reaching at t=77.\n\nThus H=11 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut let me write the actions.\n\nAlso, for freeway 8, at t=66 and t=67 unsafe, but in our path, we are not on it then.\n\nIn the sequence, when we go to y=8 at t=76, it is safe.\n\nNow, the actions:\n\nTurn 66: S\n\nTurn 67: S\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 76 action sets y_{77}=9.\n\nBut we need to output for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1, which is 66 to 76.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point collision.\n\nFor example, when on y=1 at t=69: ΔT=3, freeway 1: car span [48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\ny=2 at t=70: ΔT=4, [48-144,83-144]=[-96,-61], no.\n\ny=3 at t=71: ΔT=5, as before, safe.\n\ny=4 at t=72: similar, safe.\n\ny=5 at t=73: ΔT=7, freeway 5, cars: first [37+84,48+84]=[121,132] no, second [1+84,12+84]=[85,96] no, third [-35+84,-24+84]=[49,60] no, safe.\n\ny=6 at t=74: freeway 6, car [37+48,48+48]? ΔT= t-66, at t=74, ΔT=8, span [37+6*8, 48+6*8]=[37+48,48+48]=[85,96] no 0.\n\ny=7 at t=75: similar, [37+54,48+54]=[91,102] no.\n\ny=8 at t=76: ΔT=10, [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] and second car [-11+60, 0+60]=[49,60], no 0.\n\nAll safe.\n\nSo it works.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=11, with the sequence above.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 66: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 67: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 68: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 69: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 70: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 71: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 72: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 73: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 74: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 75: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 76: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so Turn 66: S, etc.\n\nAnd H=11, but we output the sequence.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 66\\) is 11. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by ensuring the player is not on any unsafe freeway at the critical turn \\(t = 68\\) (where freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(5\\) are unsafe) and accounts for the unsafe turns for freeway \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 66\\) and \\(t = 67\\).\n\n### Explanation:\n- At turn \\(t = 68\\), freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(5\\) are unsafe due to cars occupying position \\(x = 0\\). To avoid collision, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no freeway) at this turn.\n- From turn \\(t = 66\\) to \\(t = 67\\), the player stays at \\(y = 0\\) using actions \"S\" (stay), ensuring safety and avoiding freeway \\(y = 8\\) which is unsafe at these turns.\n- From turn \\(t = 68\\) to \\(t = 76\\), the player moves up (\"U\") each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t = 77\\). All freeways are safe during these turns:\n  - Freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(5\\) are unsafe only at \\(t = 68\\), so they are safe for \\(t \\geq 69\\).\n  - Freeway \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe only at \\(t = 66\\) and \\(t = 67\\), so it is safe for \\(t \\geq 68\\).\n  - Freeways \\(y = 6\\) and \\(y = 7\\) are always safe.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}_{t=66}^{76}\\) (for \\(H = 11\\)) is as follows:\n\n- Turn 66: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 67)\n- Turn 67: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 68)\n- Turn 68: U (move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 69)\n- Turn 69: U (move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 70)\n- Turn 70: U (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 71)\n- Turn 71: U (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 72)\n- Turn 72: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 73)\n- Turn 73: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 74)\n- Turn 74: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 75)\n- Turn 75: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 76)\n- Turn 76: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 77)\n\nAfter the action at turn 76, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 77.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 66: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 67: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 68: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 69: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 70: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 71: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 72: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 73: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 74: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 75: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 76: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 68, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe grid has freeways y=1 to 8. On each freeway, there are cars moving either left or right at given speeds.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (which must be between 1 and 8) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0.\n\nNote: When moving, at turn T the player is on freeway y_T. If at turn T the player moves to y_{T+1} (which is different from y_T), then at turn T the player is still on y_T and will not be on y_{T+1} until turn T+1. Therefore, we only check the car on the current freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nWe have to output a sequence of actions (U, D, S) starting from turn 68 until we reach y=9.\n\nThe goal is to minimize the number of turns.\n\nLet me write down the car states for each freeway at turn 68 (current turn):\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=48, tail=83, direction=left, speed=36)\n  - Since it's left-moving, the car moves left (decreasing x) at 36 units per turn.\n  - At turn t (relative to 68), the car's span at freeway 1 is: [48 - 36*t, 83 - 36*t]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (48,83,left,36) -> span: [48-36t, 83-36t]\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: \n  (48,37,right,12) -> for right, the span is [37+12t, 48+12t] (because for right, the head is at the right, tail at left; but note the representation: in the table, for a right car it's (head, tail) and then the span is [tail + s*t, head + s*t]? Let me check the update rule:\n\nFor right-moving: \n  At turn t1 (t=0): span is [tau, head]? Actually, the rule says:\n  - Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the table, for freeway 3, the first car is (48,37,right,12). \n  So head=48, tail=37? Then the initial span is [37,48] (because for right, the tail is the left end and head is the right end). Then at time T (relative time t = T-t1), the span becomes [37+12t, 48+12t].\n\nSimilarly, the second car: (12,1,right,12) -> span at t=0: [1,12] -> at time t: [1+12t, 12+12t]\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12) -> span at t=0: [-35,-24] -> at time t: [-35+12t, -24+12t]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? Actually, the table says the same three cars? \n  (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 3 and 4? Yes, same three cars.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (48,37,right,6) -> span at t=0: [37,48] -> at t: [37+6t, 48+6t]\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6: (48,37,right,6) -> [37+6t,48+6t]\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: \n  (48,37,right,6) -> [37+6t,48+6t]\n  (0,-11,right,6) -> [-11,0] at t=0 -> at t: [-11+6t, 0+6t] = [-11+6t, 6t]\n\nNow, the player starts at y0 = 0 (at turn 68). We have to get to y=9.\n\nWe can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0). We cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nThe minimal number of moves without any cars would be 9 moves (all U). But we have to avoid collisions.\n\nWe are at y=0 at turn 68. We are not on any freeway (since freeways are y=1..8) so we are safe at turn 68.\n\nWe plan the moves: we need to go from y=0 to y=9. We must avoid being on a freeway y (1..8) at a turn when there is a car on that freeway whose span includes 0 at that turn.\n\nWe are going to simulate the moves. We are at turn 68: y=0.\n\nWe need to decide actions for turns 68, 69, ... until we reach 9.\n\nWe want the minimal H, so we try to go up as much as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nLet me note the time steps: \n  t = 0: turn 68, y=0\n  t = 1: turn 69, y = y0 + a0 (a0 at turn 68)\n  ...\n\nWe will simulate for each turn the player's y and then check for each freeway that we are on at that turn whether there is a car that covers 0.\n\nWe can only be on one freeway per turn (the one equal to our y).\n\nWe need to check for each freeway we step on: at the time we are on that freeway, the car(s) on that freeway must not have a span that includes 0.\n\nLet me write a function for each freeway and time t (relative to 68) to see if at that time, freeway k is safe at position 0.\n\nBut note: at time t (relative to 68, so absolute turn = 68 + t), we are at freeway k (if our y = k) and we check the car(s) on freeway k at that absolute turn.\n\nFor freeway k, we have a list of cars. We need to check if any car's span at time t (relative) includes 0.\n\nLet me define for each car on a freeway:\n\nFor a left-moving car: span = [h - s*t, tau - s*t] -> we need to check if 0 is in [h - s*t, tau - s*t]? But note: for left, the head is at the right? Actually, the representation: in the table, for left: (head, tail) and head is the right end? \n\nLook at the update: \n  Left: [h, tau] -> [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: if head is 48 and tail is 83, that seems backwards because 48 < 83? Actually, that would be [48,83] and then moving left, so the entire car is moving left. Then the span is [48-36t, 83-36t]. But 48-36t < 83-36t, so the interval is [low, high] = [48-36t, 83-36t]. So 0 is in that interval if 48-36t <= 0 <= 83-36t.\n\nSimilarly, for right: [tau, head] becomes [tau + s*t, head + s*t]. For the first car on freeway3: [37,48] becomes [37+12t, 48+12t] -> so 0 is in [37+12t,48+12t] if 37+12t <= 0 <= 48+12t? But note: 37+12t is the left end and 48+12t is the right end, so the condition is: 37+12t <= 0 <= 48+12t.\n\nBut note: if the interval is [a, b] and a<=b, then 0 is in [a,b] if a<=0 and 0<=b.\n\nNow, let's write the condition for each freeway at time t (relative to 68) for safety: if the freeway is occupied at 0, then it is unsafe.\n\nWe are going to traverse from y=0 to y=9. We can use BFS to find the minimal path? But note the state: (y, t) where t is the relative time (number of steps from 68). But note: the car positions change with time, so the safety of a freeway at a given y depends on the absolute time (i.e., the step count).\n\nWe are at time t (relative) at freeway y. We must have y between 1 and 8 to be at risk. At y=0 and y=9, there are no cars.\n\nBut note: we are only required to reach (0,9). And we start at (0,0). So we don't have to worry about y=0 and y=9 for collisions.\n\nThe problem says: avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1..8. So if we are at y=0 or y=9, no collision.\n\nTherefore, we only check when we are at y in {1,2,...,8}.\n\nWe are going to simulate step by step. Since the minimal steps without obstacles is 9, we can try to see if we can go up 9 times without stopping. But we must check at each step when we are on a freeway.\n\nLet me check the freeways at the times when we would be there if we go up continuously.\n\nIf we do U every turn, then:\n  t0 (turn68): y=0 -> safe (not on freeway)\n  t1 (turn69): y=1 -> freeway1: check at time t=1 (because relative time 1: from 68 to 69, so t=1)\n\nFor freeway1 at t=1: \n  car: [48-36*1, 83-36*1] = [12, 47] -> 0 is not in [12,47] -> safe.\n\nt2 (turn70): y=2 -> freeway2: at t=2: [48-36*2, 83-36*2] = [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11] -> 0 is in [-24,11]? Yes, because -24<=0<=11 -> collision! \n\nSo at turn70 (t=2 relative) if we are at y=2, we collide.\n\nTherefore, we cannot go straight up without stopping or changing.\n\nWe must avoid being at freeway2 at time t=2.\n\nWe can consider:\n  Option 1: Wait at y=1 for one turn? Then we go to y=2 at t=3? But let's see:\n\nIf we do: \n  turn68: U -> y=1 at turn69 (t=1) -> safe (as above)\n  turn69: S (stay at y=1) -> then at turn69 we are at y=1 again? But then we are at freeway1 at t=1 and t=2? Let's check:\n\nAt turn70 (t=2): we are at y=1 -> freeway1: [48-36*2,83-36*2] = [-24,11] -> 0 is in this interval -> collision! \n\nSo we cannot stay at y=1 at turn69 either.\n\nTherefore, we must leave y=1 by turn69? But we only have one action at turn68: we went to y=1 at turn69. Then at turn69 we must move to either y=0 or y=2? \n\nBut we are at y=1 at turn69 (t=1). Then at turn69 (t=1) we can choose to go down to y=0 or up to y=2.\n\nIf we go down to y=0 at turn70 (t=2): then at turn70 we are at y=0 -> safe. But then we are back to start? That doesn't help.\n\nIf we go up to y=2 at turn70 (t=2): but we already saw that at t=2, freeway2 is unsafe: [48-72,83-72]=[-24,11] -> 0 is in there -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway2 at t=2.\n\nWhat if we delay going to freeway2? \n\nWe could stay at y=0 for one turn? \n\nAt turn68: S -> then at turn68 we are at y=0 (safe). Then at turn69 (t=1) we are still at y=0? Then we can move at turn69.\n\nBut then we are behind.\n\nAlternatively, we might consider going up to y=1 at turn69 (t=1) and then at turn69 (t=1) we go down to y=0? Then at turn70 (t=2) we are at y=0. Then we have made no progress.\n\nWe need to avoid freeway2 at t=2. Let me see when freeway2 becomes safe.\n\nFreeway2: same car as freeway1: [48-36t, 83-36t]\n\nWe need 0 not in [48-36t, 83-36t] i.e., either 0 < 48-36t or 0 > 83-36t.\n\nSince 48-36t decreases and 83-36t decreases, and at t=2: 48-72=-24, 83-72=11 -> 0 is in between.\n\nAt t=0: [48,83] -> 0 not in\nt=1: [12,47] -> not in\nt=2: [-24,11] -> in\nt=3: [-60,-25] -> 0 is not in because -60<=0<=-25? -> no, because 0 is greater than -25? Actually, the interval is [-60,-25] and 0 is not in that interval -> safe.\n\nSo at t=3, freeway2 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway1: at t=3: [48-108,83-108] = [-60,-25] -> safe.\n\nSo if we can be at freeway2 at t=3 (relative time 3, absolute turn 71) then it is safe.\n\nHow can we get to freeway2 at t=3?\n\nWe start at t0 (turn68) at y=0.\n\nWe need to be at y=2 at turn71 (t=3).\n\nWe can do:\n\nOption: \n  turn68: S (stay at y=0) -> turn68: safe (y=0)\n  turn69: U -> to y=1 at turn69 (t=1) -> check freeway1 at t=1: [12,47] -> safe.\n  turn70: U -> to y=2 at turn70 (t=2) -> but t=2: freeway2: [-24,11] -> unsafe.\n\nAlternatively:\n  turn68: U -> to y=1 at t=1 (safe) -> turn69: S? but at turn69 we are at y=1 at t=1? Then at turn70: we must move. If we go U at turn70: then at turn70 (t=2) we are at y=2 -> unsafe.\n\n  Or at turn69: D -> to y=0 at turn70 (t=2) -> safe (y=0) but then we are back.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  turn68: S -> y=0 at turn68 (safe) -> turn69: S -> y=0 at turn69 (t=1, safe) -> turn70: U -> y=1 at turn70 (t=2) -> freeway1 at t=2: [-24,11] -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway1 at t=2 either.\n\nHow about being at freeway1 at t=3? Then safe? Because at t=3: freeway1: [-60,-25] -> safe.\n\nSo we can be at y=1 at turn71 (t=3) and then proceed.\n\nBut we need to get to y=9.\n\nWe can plan:\n\nAt turn68: S -> y=0 (safe)\nAt turn69: S -> y=0 (safe)\nAt turn70: U -> to y=1 at turn70 (t=2) -> but at t=2, freeway1: [-24,11] -> unsafe.\n\nAlternatively, at turn68: S -> y=0\nAt turn69: U -> to y=1 at turn69 (t=1) -> safe (freeway1: [12,47])\nAt turn70: D? -> to y=0 at turn70 (t=2) -> safe (y=0) -> but then we are at y=0 at t=2.\n\nThen at turn71: U -> to y=1 at turn71 (t=3) -> freeway1: [-60,-25] -> safe.\nThen at turn72: U -> to y=2 at turn72 (t=4) -> freeway2: at t=4: [48-36*4,83-36*4] = [48-144,83-144] = [-96,-61] -> safe.\n\nBut we are at y=2 at t=4, which is safe.\n\nThen we can continue up? But we have to check the next freeways.\n\nBut this path is taking more turns: we are at turn72 at y=2, and we need to get to y=9, so 7 more steps -> total 9 steps? But we have already taken 4 steps to get to y=2? Actually:\n\nSteps: \n  t0: turn68: S -> y0=0\n  t1: turn69: U -> y1=1\n  t2: turn70: D -> y2=0\n  t3: turn71: U -> y3=1\n  t4: turn72: U -> y4=2\n\nSo at turn72 (t=4) we are at y=2. Then we need to go from y=2 to y=9: 7 moves. So total 11 moves? But we can do better.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid going down. We can stay at y=1 for one turn? But at t=2, freeway1 is unsafe.\n\nSo we must leave freeway1 by t=2? We can only go to y=0 or y=2? But y=2 at t=2 is unsafe.\n\nSo we have to go to y=0 at t=2.\n\nBut then we can come back to y=1 at t=3 (safe) and then go to y=2 at t=4 (safe).\n\nBut we lost two turns.\n\nNow, what about the other freeways? We have to go through freeways 3 to 8.\n\nLet me check the other freeways for the times we might pass.\n\nWe are at y=2 at t=4 (relative). Then we can go up:\n\nt5: turn73: U -> y=3 at t=5 -> freeway3: we need to check at t=5.\n\nFreeway3: three cars:\n  car1: [37+12*5, 48+12*5] = [37+60,48+60] = [97,108] -> 0 not in\n  car2: [1+12*5,12+12*5] = [61,72] -> not in\n  car3: [-35+12*5, -24+12*5] = [25,36] -> not in\n  So safe.\n\nt6: turn74: U -> y=4 at t=6 -> freeway4: same as freeway3? \n  car1: [37+12*6,48+12*6]=[37+72,48+72]=[109,120] -> safe\n  car2: [1+72,12+72]=[73,84] -> safe\n  car3: [-35+72,-24+72]=[37,48] -> safe\n\nt7: turn75: U -> y=5 at t=7 -> freeway5: same cars as freeway3? \n  at t=7:\n    car1: [37+84,48+84]=[121,132]\n    car2: [1+84,12+84]=[85,96]\n    car3: [-35+84,-24+84]=[49,60]\n  safe.\n\nt8: turn76: U -> y=6 at t=8 -> freeway6: one car: [37+6*8,48+6*8]=[37+48,48+48]=[85,96] -> safe.\n\nt9: turn77: U -> y=7 at t=9 -> freeway7: same as freeway6? [37+6*9,48+6*9]=[37+54,48+54]=[91,102] -> safe.\n\nt10: turn78: U -> y=8 at t=10 -> freeway8: two cars:\n  car1: [37+6*10,48+6*10]=[37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe\n  car2: [-11+6*10, 0+6*10]=[-11+60,60]=[49,60] -> safe? 0 not in [49,60] -> safe.\n\nt11: turn79: U -> y=9 -> safe, done.\n\nBut wait, we started at turn68: we did:\n\n  turn68: S (we did at the beginning) but in this path we did:\n\n  Actually, in the above we started from y=2 at t=4 and then went up without problem.\n\nBut we had to get to y=2 at t=4 by:\n\n  turn68: S -> y=0 (t0: safe)\n  turn69: U -> y=1 (t1: safe) [freeway1 at t1: safe]\n  turn70: D -> y=0 (t2: safe)\n  turn71: U -> y=1 (t3: safe) [freeway1 at t3: safe]\n  turn72: U -> y=2 (t4: safe) [freeway2 at t4: safe]\n\nThen from turn72 (y=2) we did 7 U to get to y=9 at turn79? \n\nTotal turns: from turn68 to turn79: 12 turns? But we did 11 actions? \n\nThe sequence of actions: \n  turn68: S\n  turn69: U\n  turn70: D\n  turn71: U\n  turn72: U\n  turn73: U\n  turn74: U\n  turn75: U\n  turn76: U\n  turn77: U\n  turn78: U\n  turn79: U -> then at turn79 we are at y=9.\n\nBut at turn79, we have taken 12 actions? Because from turn68 to turn79: 12 steps? \n\nActually, the relative time: \n  t0: turn68 -> after 0 actions, we are at y=0.\n  We take actions at turn68,69,...,78 -> 11 actions? Then at turn79 we are at y=9.\n\nSo H=11.\n\nBut we want minimal. Is there a faster way?\n\nWe avoided freeway1 and freeway2 at the critical times, but maybe we can go through freeway2 at a safe time without taking two extra turns.\n\nNote: we can also go down to avoid the collision? But we are at the bottom, so we cannot go below 0.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to skip freeway1 and freeway2 at the beginning and go directly to a higher freeway? But we start at y=0 and we can only move one per turn.\n\nWe can consider going up to y=1 at t=1 (safe) and then at t=1 (turn69) we go up to y=2? But at t=2 we are at freeway2 which is unsafe.\n\nBut what if we go up to y=3 at t=3? \n\nWe need to be at y=3 at t=3. How?\n\n  turn68: U -> y=1 at t=1 (safe)\n  turn69: U -> y=2 at t=2 (unsafe) -> collision.\n\n  turn68: U -> y=1 at t=1 (safe)\n  turn69: U -> y=2 at t=2 (collision) -> not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, we can go to y=1 at t=1, then stay at y=1? But at t=2, freeway1 is unsafe.\n\nSo we must leave freeway1 at t=1? Then we can only go to y=0 or y=2? \n\nIf we go to y=2 at t=2: unsafe.\n\nIf we go to y=0 at t=2: safe, but then we are back.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway1 at t=2? And we cannot be at freeway2 at t=2.\n\nTherefore, the only safe place at t=2 is y=0 or y=9? But we are at y=0 at t=2? Then we are safe.\n\nBut then we can try to go up later.\n\nBut we lost two turns to get back to y=0.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to go up to y=1 at t=1 (safe), then at t=1 (turn69) we go down to y=0? Then at t=2 we are at y=0 (safe). Then at turn70 (t=2) we can go up to y=1? But at t=3 (turn71) we are at y=1? Then freeway1 at t=3 is safe ([-60,-25]). Then we can go up to y=2 at t=4 (safe) as before.\n\nSo same as the previous plan.\n\nBut we can then proceed from y=2 at t=4.\n\nNow, is there a way to get to y=2 earlier? \n\nWe can be at y=2 at t=3? \n\nHow? \n  We start at y=0 at t0.\n  We can do:\n    turn68: U -> to y=1 at t1 (safe)\n    turn69: S? -> then at turn69 we are still at y=1? Then at t=2 (turn70) we are at y=1 -> unsafe.\n\n    turn68: U -> y=1 at t1\n    turn69: D -> to y=0 at t2 (safe) -> then at turn70 (t2) we are at y=0.\n\n    Then we cannot be at y=2 at t=3 because we are at y=0 at t2, and then at turn70 (t2) we can go U to y=1 at t3 (safe) and then at turn71 (t3) we go U to y=2 at t4? \n\nSo we cannot get to y=2 at t=3.\n\nTherefore, the earliest we can be at y=2 is t=4.\n\nBut note: we have freeways 3 to 8 to traverse. They are safe at the times we pass in the above plan? \n\nWe passed freeway3 at t=5, freeway4 at t=6, etc. and they were safe.\n\nBut what about freeway8? We passed at t=10: \n  car1: [97,108] -> safe\n  car2: [49,60] -> safe.\n\nBut note: freeway8 has two cars. We checked at t=10: both are above 0? so safe.\n\nIs there a possibility to get to y=9 faster? \n\nWe lost 4 turns to get to y=2 (at turn72: t=4). Then 7 moves to y=9: total 11 moves.\n\nBut we can try to go through the freeways faster? \n\nAlternatively, we might avoid the initial delay by going up to a freeway that is safe earlier? But we are constrained by the first two freeways.\n\nWe can try to go to freeway3 without being on freeway1 and freeway2 at the critical times? But we have to go through them.\n\nUnless we can skip a freeway? But we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo we must go through each freeway.\n\nAnother idea: we can go down? But we are at 0, we cannot go down.\n\nOr we can go up to y=1 at t=1, then at t=1 we go to y=2? but at t=2 we are at freeway2 and unsafe.\n\nWe must avoid freeway2 at t=2. So we have to be at freeway2 at a time when it is safe: t=0,1,3,4,... \n\nt=0: we are at y=0, not on freeway2.\nt=1: we are at y=1, not on freeway2.\nt=2: unsafe\nt=3: safe.\n\nSo the next safe time for freeway2 is t=3. But we cannot get to y=2 at t=3? \n\nWe can try:\n\n  turn68: S -> y=0 (t0: safe)\n  turn69: U -> y=1 (t1: safe) \n  turn70: S? -> but at turn70 (t2) we are at y=1 -> freeway1: [48-36*2,83-36*2]=[-24,11] -> unsafe.\n\n  turn68: U -> y=1 (t1: safe)\n  turn69: S -> y=1 at t2: unsafe.\n\n  turn68: U -> y=1 (t1)\n  turn69: U -> y=2 (t2) -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=2 at t=3? \n\nWe can only be at y=2 at t=3 if we do:\n\n  turn68: U (to y=1 at t1)\n  turn69: U (to y=2 at t2) -> but that's t2.\n\nTo be at y=2 at t3, we need to have moved from y=0 to y=1 at some time and then from y=1 to y=2 at the next.\n\nBut we start at t0: y=0.\n\nAt t1: we can be at y=1 (if we do U at turn68) or y=0 (if we do S or D, but D not possible).\n\nAt t2: from y=1 we can go to y=0,1,2.\n\nBut if we go to y=2 at t2: unsafe.\n\nAt t3: we can be at y=2 only if we were at y=1 or y=3 at t2? But we can only move one step.\n\nSo from t2 (y=1) we can go to y=2 at t3? \n\nBut we were at y=1 at t2: that is unsafe (as we saw).\n\nAlternatively, from t2 (y=0) we can go to y=1 at t3, then we are at y=1 at t3: safe (freeway1: [-60,-25] -> safe). Then at t4 we can go to y=2.\n\nSo we cannot get to y=2 at t3.\n\nTherefore, the minimal time to get to y=2 is t=4.\n\nBut note: we have freeway8 which has a car that is at [0,-11] at t0? Then at t0, freeway8: car2: [-11,0] -> that includes 0? So if we are at freeway8 at t0, we collide. But we are not at freeway8 at t0.\n\nBut in our plan, we are at freeway8 at t=10: which is safe.\n\nBut what about at other times? For example, if we pass freeway8 earlier? \n\nWe are constrained by the first two freeways.\n\nBut let me check if there is a way to get through freeway8 faster? \n\nIn the above plan we are at y=8 at t=10. But freeway8 has two cars. The second car: at t0: [-11,0] -> so at t0, if we were at freeway8 we would collide. But we are not.\n\nAt t=1: [-11+6,0+6] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in this interval? Yes, because -5<=0<=6 -> unsafe.\n\nAt t=2: [-11+12,12] = [1,12] -> safe (0 not in)\n\nAt t=3: [7,18] -> safe.\n\nSo actually, freeway8 is unsafe at t=0 and t=1, but safe at t>=2.\n\nIn our plan we pass at t=10, which is safe.\n\nBut we could pass freeway8 earlier? \n\nWe are at y=2 at t=4. Then we go up one per turn: \n  t5: y=3 -> safe\n  t6: y=4 -> safe\n  t7: y=5 -> safe\n  t8: y=6 -> safe\n  t9: y=7 -> safe\n  t10: y=8 -> safe\n\nWe cannot go faster than one per turn.\n\nBut we could skip some freeways? No, we must go through each.\n\nWe could go down in the middle to avoid a collision? But we are going up and the freeways above are safe at the times we pass.\n\nSo the plan we have takes 11 moves: \n\n  turn68: S\n  turn69: U\n  turn70: D\n  turn71: U\n  turn72: U\n  turn73: U\n  turn74: U\n  turn75: U\n  turn76: U\n  turn77: U\n  turn78: U\n\nBut wait, after turn78: we are at y=8? Then we need one more U to get to y=9.\n\nSo the last action at turn78: U -> then at turn79 we are at y=9.\n\nSo we need 11 actions: from turn68 to turn78 (inclusive) we take 11 actions? \n\nThe turns: \n  turn68: first action\n  turn69: second\n  ...\n  turn78: 11th action.\n\nThen at turn79, we are at y=9.\n\nBut we started at turn68 at y=0. After 11 actions (over 11 turns) we reach y=9 at turn79.\n\nSo H=11.\n\nBut let me see if we can do it in 10 or 9.\n\nWe must be at y=9 at the end of the last action.\n\nMinimal steps: 9 moves (all U) would get us to y=9 at turn68+9 = turn77? \n\nBut we cannot do that because of freeway2 at t=2.\n\nCan we do 10 moves? \n\nWe would reach y=9 at turn78.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions.\n\nWe must pass freeway2 at a safe time. The safe times for freeway2 are t=0,1,3,4,... (avoid t=2).\n\nSo if we are at freeway2 at t=3 or t=4, etc.\n\nBut to get to freeway2 at t=3: \n  We start at y=0 at t0.\n  We need to be at y=2 at t3.\n\n  We can do: \n    t0: U -> y=1 at t1\n    t1: ? \n    t2: ?\n    t3: at y=2.\n\n  From t1 (y=1) we can go to y=2 at t2? Then we are at freeway2 at t2 -> unsafe.\n\n  Or we can go: \n    t0: U -> y=1 at t1 (safe)\n    t1: S -> but then at t2 we are at y=1 -> unsafe.\n\n    t0: U -> y=1 at t1\n    t1: D -> to y=0 at t2 (safe)\n    t2: U -> to y=1 at t3 (safe) [freeway1 at t3: safe]\n    but then we are at y=1 at t3, not y=2.\n\n  To be at y=2 at t3, we must be at y=1 at t2? But then we are at freeway1 at t2 -> unsafe.\n\n  Alternatively, we can be at y=3 at t3? \n    t0: U -> y=1 at t1\n    t1: U -> y=2 at t2 (unsafe) -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway2 at t3 without being at freeway1 at t2? which is unsafe.\n\nTherefore, we cannot do it in less than 11 moves.\n\nBut let me check if we can be at freeway2 at t=4 (as we did) and then do 7 moves to y=9: total 11 moves.\n\nBut note: we can possibly move faster through the upper freeways? \n\nWe can only move one per turn.\n\nAnother idea: we can go down in the upper freeways to avoid a collision? But the upper freeways are safe at the times we pass.\n\nWe can try to go up to y=2 at t=4, then to y=3 at t=5, etc., and we did that.\n\nBut we did 7 moves from y=2 to y=9: that's 7 moves. And we took 4 moves to get to y=2? total 11.\n\nBut the 4 moves to get to y=2: \n  S, U, D, U, U -> that's 5 actions? \n\nWait, let me list:\n\n  Action0 (turn68): S -> y0=0 -> after action0: y=0 (at turn68, we are at y=0 after action? But note: the update: after the action at turn t, we update to the next turn.\n\nWe start at turn68: position (0,0). Then we take an action at turn68, which moves us to turn69.\n\nSo:\n  Turn68: action a0 -> at turn69, we are at y1 = y0 + delta(a0)\n  Turn69: action a1 -> at turn70, y2 = y1 + delta(a1)\n\nIn our sequence:\n\n  turn68: a0 = S -> at turn69: y=0+0=0\n  turn69: a1 = U -> at turn70: y=0+1=1\n  turn70: a2 = D -> at turn71: y=1-1=0\n  turn71: a3 = U -> at turn72: y=0+1=1\n  turn72: a4 = U -> at turn73: y=1+1=2\n\nSo after 5 actions (at turn73) we are at y=2? \n\nBut we want to be at y=2 at turn72? \n\nActually, the position at turn t is after the action of turn t-1? \n\nThe problem says: \n  Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nSo at turn t1 (68): we are at (0,0). Then we take action a_{68} -> then at turn69: y_{69} = y_{68} + Delta y_{68}\n\nSo we are at turn68: we are at y=0. Then we take an action that will determine y at turn69.\n\nWe want to be at y=2 at a certain turn.\n\nIn our plan, we want to be at y=2 at turn72? \n\nHow? \n  turn68: a68 -> y69\n  turn69: a69 -> y70\n  turn70: a70 -> y71\n  turn71: a71 -> y72\n\nSo after 4 actions, we have y72.\n\nWe want y72=2.\n\nSo:\n  a68: ? -> y69 = 0 + delta(a68)\n  a69: ? -> y70 = y69 + delta(a69)\n  a70: ? -> y71 = y70 + delta(a70)\n  a71: ? -> y72 = y71 + delta(a71) = 2\n\nWe also have to avoid collisions at the intermediate freeways.\n\nWe are at:\n  turn69: y69 -> must be safe: if y69 in [1,8] then check freeway y69 at t=1 (relative time: turn69 is t1? because from turn68 to turn69: t=1)\n  turn70: y70 -> check at t=2\n  turn71: y71 -> check at t=3\n  turn72: y72 -> check at t=4\n\nWe want y72=2.\n\nWe can try:\n\n  a68: U -> y69=1 -> check freeway1 at t=1: [12,47] -> safe.\n  a69: ? \n      if a69=U: then y70=2 -> check freeway2 at t=2: [-24,11] -> unsafe.\n      if a69=D: then y70=0 -> safe.\n      if a69=S: then y70=1 -> check freeway1 at t=2: [-24,11] -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must do a69=D -> y70=0 (safe at t2: not on freeway)\n\nThen a70: ? \n      if a70=U: then y71=1 -> check freeway1 at t=3: [-60,-25] -> safe.\n      if a70=S: then y71=0 -> safe, but then we are behind.\n      if a70=D: not possible? we are at 0.\n\nSo a70=U -> y71=1 (safe at t3)\n\nThen a71: U -> y72=2 -> check freeway2 at t=4: [-96,-61] -> safe.\n\nSo we have:\n\n  turn68: U\n  turn69: D\n  turn70: U\n  turn71: U\n\nThen at turn72: y=2 (safe).\n\nThis is 4 actions to get to y=2 at turn72 (which is relative time t=4? because from turn68 to turn72: 4 turns later, so t=4).\n\nBut note: the relative time for the car update: at turn72, the time elapsed is 72-68=4 -> t=4.\n\nThen we can go up:\n\n  turn72: U -> y73=3 -> check freeway3 at t=5: safe (as before)\n  turn73: U -> y74=4 -> freeway4 at t=6: safe\n  turn74: U -> y75=5 -> freeway5 at t=7: safe\n  turn75: U -> y76=6 -> freeway6 at t=8: safe\n  turn76: U -> y77=7 -> freeway7 at t=9: safe\n  turn77: U -> y78=8 -> freeway8 at t=10: safe\n  turn78: U -> y79=9 -> done.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\n  turn68: U\n  turn69: D\n  turn70: U\n  turn71: U\n  turn72: U\n  turn73: U\n  turn74: U\n  turn75: U\n  turn76: U\n  turn77: U\n  turn78: U\n\nTotal 11 actions.\n\nWe reach y=9 at turn79.\n\nBut note: we started at turn68. After 11 actions (from turn68 to turn78) we get to y=9 at turn79.\n\nIs there a shorter sequence? \n\nWe must pass freeway1 and freeway2. The earliest we can pass freeway2 is at t=4 (relative) as above. Then 7 moves to y=9: total 11.\n\nIf we try to be at freeway2 at t=3: \n  We need y_{71}=2? (because turn71: t=71-68=3)\n  Then:\n      a68: ? -> y69\n      a69: ? -> y70\n      a70: ? -> y71=2\n\n  We can do:\n      a68: U -> y69=1 (safe at t=1)\n      a69: U -> y70=2 -> unsafe at t=2 (freeway2: [-24,11])\n      a68: U -> y69=1\n      a69: D -> y70=0 (safe at t=2)\n      a70: U -> y71=1 (safe at t=3) -> but we are at y=1, not 2.\n\n  Or a68: U -> y69=1\n      a69: S -> y70=1 -> unsafe at t=2.\n\nSo we cannot have y71=2.\n\nTherefore, minimal is 11.\n\nBut let me check freeway8: we pass at t=10: safe.\n\nBut what about freeway8 at other times? \n\nWe have to be at freeway8 at turn78? (if we do 11 moves: the last U to y=9 is at turn78, so we are at y=8 at turn78? Then freeway8 at t=10: 78-68=10 -> t=10: safe.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn78 we do U and then at turn79 we are at y=9. So at turn78 we are at y=8? Then we are at freeway8 at turn78: t=10: safe.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\n  turn68: U\n  turn69: D\n  turn70: U\n  turn71: U\n  turn72: U  (now at y=2 at turn72: t=4)\n  turn73: U -> y=3 at turn73 (t=5)\n  turn74: U -> y=4 at turn74 (t=6)\n  turn75: U -> y=5 at turn75 (t=7)\n  turn76: U -> y=6 at turn76 (t=8)\n  turn77: U -> y=7 at turn77 (t=9)\n  turn78: U -> y=8 at turn78? Actually, at turn78 we are at y=8? Then we take an action at turn78: U -> then at turn79 we are at y=9.\n\nBut we have to output actions from turn68 to the last action that gets us to y=9 at the next turn.\n\nSo we need to output 11 actions: the last action is at turn78: U.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: D\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: U\nTurn 73: U\nTurn 74: U\nTurn 75: U\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: U\nTurn 78: U\n\nBut let me verify the positions:\n\n  Start: turn68: (0,0)\n  After turn68 (action U): at turn69: y=1 -> freeway1 at t=1: [12,47] -> safe.\n  After turn69 (action D): at turn70: y=0 -> safe.\n  After turn70 (action U): at turn71: y=1 -> freeway1 at t=3: [48-36*3,83-36*3]=[48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25] -> safe.\n  After turn71 (action U): at turn72: y=2 -> freeway2 at t=4: [48-36*4,83-36*4]=[-96,-61] -> safe.\n  After turn72 (U): turn73: y=3 -> freeway3 at t=5: \n        car1: [37+12*5,48+12*5]=[97,108] -> safe\n        car2: [1+60,12+60]=[61,72] -> safe\n        car3: [-35+60,-24+60]=[25,36] -> safe\n  After turn73 (U): turn74: y=4 -> freeway4 at t=6: same as above but +12: [37+72,48+72]=[109,120] (car1), [1+72,12+72]=[73,84] (car2), [37,48] (car3) -> safe.\n  After turn74 (U): turn75: y=5 -> freeway5 at t=7: [37+84,48+84]=[121,132] (car1), [85,96] (car2), [49,60] (car3) -> safe.\n  After turn75 (U): turn76: y=6 -> freeway6 at t=8: [37+6*8,48+6*8]=[85,96] -> safe.\n  After turn76 (U): turn77: y=7 -> freeway7 at t=9: [37+54,48+54]=[91,102] -> safe.\n  After turn77 (U): turn78: y=8 -> freeway8 at t=10: \n        car1: [37+6*10,48+6*10]=[97,108] -> safe\n        car2: [-11+6*10,6*10]=[49,60] -> safe (0 not in [49,60])\n  After turn78 (U): turn79: y=9 -> done.\n\nAll safe.\n\nSo the minimal number of turns is 11.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence of actions for t=0 to H-1. Here H=11.\n\nWe output:\n\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: D\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: U\nTurn 73: U\nTurn 74: U\nTurn 75: U\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: U\nTurn 78: U\n\nBut note: the answer format: \n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1+1}\n...\n}\n\nSo t1=68.\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: D\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: U\nTurn 73: U\nTurn 74: U\nTurn 75: U\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: U\nTurn 78: U\n}\n\nBut wait, we have 11 lines? From turn68 to turn78.\n\nYes.\n\nIs there a sequence with 10 moves? \n\nSuppose we try to be at y=9 at turn78? Then we started at y=0 at turn68, so we need to have 10 moves? But we have to avoid the collisions.\n\nWe must pass freeway2 at a safe time. The earliest safe time for freeway2 after t0 is t=1,3,4,... \n\nAt t=1: we can be at freeway2? \n  We start at y=0 at t0.\n  We can do:\n    turn68: U -> y=1 at t1 (freeway1: safe) \n    then at turn69: we can go to y=2 at t2? But that's unsafe.\n\n    Or turn68: U -> y=1 at t1\n    then turn69: we go to y=2 at t2: unsafe.\n\n  We cannot be at freeway2 at t1? Because we start at y=0 and can only move to y=1 at t1.\n\nSo the next safe time is t=3 or t=4.\n\nTo be at freeway2 at t=3: \n  We need to be at y=2 at turn71 (t=3).\n  Then:\n      turn68: U -> y69=1 (t1: safe)\n      turn69: ? -> y70\n      turn70: ? -> y71=2\n\n  From y69=1, we can go at turn69: \n        D: y70=0 (safe at t2: y=0)\n        then at turn70: U -> y71=1 (safe at t3: freeway1 safe) -> then we are at y=1, not 2.\n\n        U: y70=2 (unsafe at t2: freeway2)\n        S: y70=1 (unsafe at t2: freeway1)\n\n  So we cannot get to y=2 at t3.\n\nTherefore, we must be at freeway2 at t=4: at turn72 (as we did). Then we need 7 more moves to y=9: so we finish at turn79, which requires 11 actions (from turn68 to turn78).\n\nHence, minimal H=11.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) in minimal turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the sequence of actions must navigate around unsafe conditions on freeways 1 and 2 at specific turns. The cars on freeway 1 and 2 (both moving left at speed 36) create a collision risk at \\(y = 2\\) on turn 70 (relative time \\(t = 2\\)) and at \\(y = 1\\) on turn 70 (relative time \\(t = 2\\)). \n\nThe earliest safe time to be at \\(y = 2\\) is turn 72 (relative time \\(t = 4\\)), as the car spans on freeways 1 and 2 do not include 0 at \\(t = 4\\):\n- Freeway 1: \\([48 - 36 \\times 4, 83 - 36 \\times 4] = [-96, -61]\\), 0 not in interval.\n- Freeway 2: same as freeway 1.\n\nThe sequence starts at turn 68 (\\(y = 0\\)):\n- **Turn 68 (action U)**: Move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 69. Check freeway 1 at \\(t = 1\\): \\([48 - 36 \\times 1, 83 - 36 \\times 1] = [12, 47]\\), 0 not in interval → safe.\n- **Turn 69 (action D)**: Move to \\(y = 0\\) at turn 70. Not on a freeway → safe.\n- **Turn 70 (action U)**: Move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 71.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. I start at turn t1=70, position (0,0). The actions are U (up), D (down), or S (stay), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes over time based on direction and speed.\n\nThe car spans are given for turn t1=70. For future turns, I need to compute the span based on the direction and speed.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head -24, tail 11, direction left, speed 36. Since it's left-moving, the car is moving left, so head and tail decrease over time. Head is -24, tail is 11? That seems odd because usually head should be greater than tail if it's moving left, but let's see the span.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For left-moving, it says Span(t1) = [h, τ] and at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)].\n\nBut here for freeway 1, head h=-24, tail τ=11? But -24 is less than 11, so [h, τ] would be from -24 to 11, which is increasing, but since it's left-moving, it should be decreasing. I think I need to interpret head and tail properly.\n\nPerhaps \"head\" and \"tail\" are defined such that for left-moving, head is the front, which is smaller if moving left? But in the update, it decreases, so if head is -24, and it decreases, it becomes more negative.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, it increases.\n\nIn freeway 3, there are multiple cars, like (-48, -59, right, 12). -48 and -59, with direction right. If direction right, span should be [τ, h]? Let's check the notation.\n\nFrom the car update rules:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] where ΔT = T - t1\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it's given as (-24, 11, left, 36). So for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ] = [-24, 11]. But [-24, 11] means from -24 to 11, which is left to right if we think of increasing x, but since it's moving left, the whole thing shifts left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like in freeway 3, (-48, -59, right, 12), and Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48] because τ is tail, h is head? I need to see the order.\n\nIn the notation: for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" so τ is the left end, h is the right end. Similarly for left-moving, \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" but if h is head and moving left, h should be the right end, τ left end? I'm confused.\n\nLet's read carefully:\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nIf it's moving left, the head is decreasing, so if [h, τ] at t1, with h and τ, and both decrease, so if h < τ, it might be decreasing interval, but in math, [a,b] with a<b is increasing.\n\nFor freeway 1, h = -24, τ = 11, so [h, τ] = [-24, 11] at t1. Since moving left, at T, it becomes [-24 - sΔT, 11 - sΔT].\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" so for freeway 3, (-48, -59, right, 12), but it's (head, tail, direction, speed), so for right-moving, head h is the front, so for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [tail, head], so with τ and h, and since moving right, both increase.\n\nIn this case, for (-48, -59, right, 12), it says (head, tail, ...), so head = -48, tail = -59? But tail should be left, head right, so if head = -48, tail = -59, that means head is greater than tail, since -48 > -59, so for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48], and at T, [ -59 + sΔT, -48 + sΔT].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, if head = -24, tail = 11, head < tail, so Span(t1) = [h, τ] = [-24, 11], at T, [-24 - sΔT, 11 - sΔT].\n\nBut [-24,11] is from left to right, and moving left, so it shifts left.\n\nThe key point is that collision occurs if at turn T, for the freeway y_T that I'm on, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, note that when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I decide action to go to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I am on y_T, so I collide if on that freeway, 0 in span at T.\n\nWhen I move at turn T from y_T to y_{T+1}, during turn T, I am on y_T, so I check collision on y_T at turn T. After the action, I am on y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_{T} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut for y_{T+1}, at turn T, I'm not on it, so I don't care about y_{T+1} at turn T. Only at turn T, I care about the freeway I'm on at that turn, which is y_T.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T+1, I care about y_{T+1}.\n\nNow, I need to reach (0,9), so y=9, which is not a freeway, since freeways are y=1 to 8. y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so I can be there safely.\n\nThe grid has y=0 to 9, freeways at y=1 to 8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nI start at (0,0), which is safe, and need to reach (0,9), safe.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9, passing through y=1 to 8, but I have to avoid being on a freeway when a car is covering position x=0 at that turn.\n\nx=0 is the position we care about, since the player is always at x=0.\n\nThe player is at (0, y_t), so x is always 0, we only move in y-direction.\n\nCollision if at turn T, y_T = k for some k=1 to 8, and for freeway k, there is a car with 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nSo for each freeway and each turn, I need to know if position x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nI need to simulate the car positions over time to see when it's safe to be on each row.\n\nSince I need the minimal H, I should try to go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their spans over time.\n\nLet t1 = 70.\n\nDefine Δt = T - 70, so at turn T = 70 + Δt.\n\nFor each freeway, for each car, the span at T.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, h=-24, τ=11, d=left, s=36\n\nFor left-moving, span at T: [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] = [-24 - 36 Δt, 11 - 36 Δt]\n\n0 is in span if -24 -36 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 11 -36 Δt\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-24,11,left,36) so identical to freeway 1.\n\n| Freeway 2 | (-24,11,left,36) | so same as freeway 1.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars: (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, span at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nFor first car: head=-48, tail=-59, d=right, s=12, so τ = tail = -59, h = head = -48? In the tuple, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for right-moving, head should be the right end, tail left end.\n\nIn this case, for (-48,-59,right,12), head=-48, tail=-59, since tail=-59 < head=-48, so for right-moving, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-59 + 12 Δt, -48 + 12 Δt]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (36,25,right,12), head=36, tail=25, so τ=25, h=36, span at t1: [25,36], at T: [25 + 12 Δt, 36 + 12 Δt]\n\nThird car: (0,-11,right,12), head=0, tail=-11, so τ=-11, h=0, span at t1: [-11, 0], at T: [-11 + 12 Δt, 0 + 12 Δt] = [-11 + 12 Δt, 12 Δt]\n\nFor freeway 4: same as freeway 3? \"(-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\" identical to freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: same, also identical.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (60,49,right,6)\n\nhead=60, tail=49, d=right, s=6, so τ=49, h=60, span at t1: [49,60], at T: [49 + 6 Δt, 60 + 6 Δt]\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6? (60,49,right,6) so identical.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (60,49,right,6), (12,1,right,6)\n\nFirst car same as above: (60,49,right,6), span at T: [49 + 6 Δt, 60 + 6 Δt]\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6), head=12, tail=1, so τ=1, h=12, span at t1: [1,12], at T: [1 + 6 Δt, 12 + 6 Δt]\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when x=0 is covered, i.e., 0 in some car's span at turn T.\n\nSince the player is at x=0, collision if for the row y_T, 0 is in the span of any car on that row at turn T.\n\nI need for each row and each turn, whether it is occupied.\n\nBut since I start at turn 70, and I want to minimize H, I should go up quickly, so I need to see for each row, when it is safe to be there.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when x=0 is occupied.\n\nStart with freeway 1: span [ -24 -36 Δt, 11 -36 Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -24 -36 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 11 -36 Δt\n\nWhich is:\n\n-24 -36 Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 11 -36 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -24 -36 Δt ≤ 0 => -36 Δt ≤ 24 => multiply both sides by -1, reverse inequality: 36 Δt ≥ -24, which is always true since Δt ≥0, 36 Δt ≥0 > -24? -24 is negative, 36 Δt ≥0, so yes, 36 Δt ≥ -24 always true.\n\n-24 -36 Δt ≤ 0 => -36 Δt ≤ 24, divide by -36, reverse inequality: Δt ≥ -24/36, but Δt ≥0, so always true.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 11 -36 Δt => 36 Δt ≤ 11 => Δt ≤ 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nAlso, since it's a closed interval, 0 ≤ 11 -36 Δt and -24 -36 Δt ≤ 0.\n\nBut -24 -36 Δt ≤ 0 always for Δt ≥0, so only constraint is 0 ≤ 11 -36 Δt => Δt ≤ 11/36\n\nSimilarly, for the lower bound, since -24 -36 Δt could be less than 0, but the condition is satisfied as long as 0 ≤ upper bound.\n\n0 in [L,U] if L ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ U.\n\nL = -24 -36 Δt, U = 11 -36 Δt\n\nL ≤ 0: -24 -36 Δt ≤ 0 => -36 Δt ≤ 24 => Δt ≥ -24/36 = -2/3, always true for Δt ≥0.\n\nU ≥ 0: 11 -36 Δt ≥ 0 => 36 Δt ≤ 11 => Δt ≤ 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nSo for freeway 1, 0 in span only when Δt ≤ 11/36, so for Δt = 0, which is turn 70, U=11>0, L=-24<0, so 0 in span. Δt=0: T=70, U=11, L=-24, so yes, 0 in [-24,11].\n\nAt Δt=1, T=71, U=11-36= -25, L= -24-36= -60, U=-25 <0, so 0 not in [-60,-25], since 0 > -25? U=-25 <0, L=-60<0, so 0 not in [L,U] because U<0.\n\nSimilarly for larger Δt.\n\nSo for freeway 1, occupied only at Δt=0, i.e., turn 70.\n\nΔt ≤ 11/36 <1, so only at Δt=0, turn 70.\n\nBut Δt=0 is integer, so only at T=70.\n\nNow freeway 2 is same as freeway 1, so also occupied only at T=70.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: [-59 +12 Δt, -48 +12 Δt]\n\n0 in span if L ≤0 and 0≤U, so -59 +12 Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 +12 Δt? U = -48 +12 Δt\n\nL = -59 +12 Δt ≤ 0 => 12 Δt ≤ 59 => Δt ≤ 59/12 ≈ 4.916\n\nU = -48 +12 Δt ≥ 0 => 12 Δt ≥ 48 => Δt ≥ 4\n\nSo for first car, occupied when 4 ≤ Δt ≤ 4.916, so Δt=4 or 5? Δt integer, so Δt=4 and Δt=5? Let's see.\n\nAt Δt=4, L= -59 +48 = -11, U= -48 +48=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included, so yes.\n\nAt Δt=5, L= -59 +60=1, U= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in, since 0<1.\n\nL=1>0, U=12>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at Δt=4, T=74.\n\nΔt=4, Δt = T -70, so T=74.\n\nL= -59 +12*4 = -59+48= -11 ≤0, U= -48+48=0 ≥0, so 0 in [-11,0].\n\nAt Δt=5, L= -59+60=1>0, U=12>0, 0 not in.\n\nAt Δt=3, L= -59+36= -23, U= -48+36= -12, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at Δt=4.\n\nBut there are multiple cars.\n\nSecond car on freeway 3: [25 +12 Δt, 36 +12 Δt]\n\nL=25+12Δt >0 for all Δt≥0, since 25>0, so U=36+12Δt>0, L>0, so 0 not in [L,U] for any Δt, because L≥25>0.\n\nThird car: [-11 +12 Δt, 12 Δt]\n\nL = -11 +12 Δt, U = 12 Δt\n\n0 in span if L ≤0 and 0≤U.\n\nU = 12 Δt ≥0 always for Δt≥0.\n\nL ≤0: -11 +12 Δt ≤0 => 12 Δt ≤11 => Δt ≤ 11/12 ≈0.916\n\nAlso, U ≥0 always.\n\nSo for Δt ≤ 11/12, so Δt=0, since Δt integer.\n\nAt Δt=0, L=-11, U=0, so [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=1, L=-11+12=1, U=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 3, first car occupies at Δt=4 (T=74), second car never occupies x=0, third car occupies at Δt=0 (T=70).\n\nSo overall, for freeway 3, occupied at T=70 and T=74.\n\nNow freeway 4 same as freeway 3, so also occupied at T=70 and T=74.\n\nFreeway 5 same, occupied at T=70 and T=74.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car, [49 +6 Δt, 60 +6 Δt]\n\nL=49+6Δt >0 for all Δt≥0, U>0, so 0 never in span, so always safe? L=49>0, so min x=49>0, so x=0 never covered, so freeway 6 is always safe, no car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7 same as 6, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: same as freeway 6, [49 +6 Δt, 60 +6 Δt], L=49>0, so never at x=0.\n\nSecond car: [1 +6 Δt, 12 +6 Δt]\n\nL=1+6Δt >0 for Δt≥0, U>0, so always L≥1>0, so 0 not in span, never occupied.\n\nSo freeway 8 is always safe? L=1+6Δt ≥1>0, so x=0 not covered.\n\nBut at Δt=0, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nYes.\n\nSo summary for each freeway when occupied at x=0:\n\n- y=1: occupied only at T=70\n\n- y=2: occupied only at T=70\n\n- y=3: occupied at T=70 and T=74\n\n- y=4: occupied at T=70 and T=74\n\n- y=5: occupied at T=70 and T=74\n\n- y=6: never occupied, always safe\n\n- y=7: never occupied, always safe\n\n- y=8: never occupied, always safe\n\ny=6,7,8 are always safe.\n\ny=1 and 2 occupied only at T=70.\n\ny=3,4,5 occupied at T=70 and T=74.\n\nI start at T=70, position y=0.\n\nAt T=70, I am at y=0, which is safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe actions: at each turn, I can go U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\ny must be integer between 0 and 9.\n\nMinimal H: since I need to go from y=0 to y=9, at least 9 steps if I go up every turn, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nBut from above, y=6,7,8 are always safe, so I can be there anytime.\n\ny=1 and 2 are only occupied at T=70, so after T=70, they are safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3,4,5 occupied at T=70 and T=74, so at other times, safe.\n\nT=74 is a problem.\n\nNow, I start at T=70, y=0.\n\nAt turn T=70, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nI need to choose action for turn 70: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go U, I go to y=1 at T=71? Let's see the timing.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position (0, y_T).\n\nI take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nAfter action, for the next turn.\n\nAt the beginning of turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nI take action a_T, then I move to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on y_T.\n\nFor turn T=70, I am at y=0, which is safe, no collision.\n\nThen I take action a_{70}, which sets y_{71} = y_{70} + Δy.\n\nIf I take U, y_{71} = 1.\n\nThen at turn T=71, I am at y=1.\n\nNow, for y=1, when is it occupied? Only at T=70, not at T=71, since after T=70, it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=2 at T=71, same, safe.\n\nBut y=3,4,5 are occupied at T=74.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=3,4,5 at T=74.\n\nAlso, since I start at y=0, T=70.\n\nMinimal H: if I go up every turn, I can reach y=9 in 9 turns: from T=70 to T=78? Let's see.\n\nAt T=70, y=0\n\nAfter action at T=70, y_{71} set.\n\nSequence of y_t.\n\nLet t be the turn index.\n\nt=70: y=0\n\nAfter a_{70}, y_{71} = y_{70} + Δy\n\nSimilarly, y_{72} = y_{71} + Δy, and so on.\n\nI need y_{t_start + H -1} =9, where t_start = t1=70.\n\nThe sequence is from t=70 to t=70+H-1 for actions, and positions from t=70 to t=70+H-1? Let's see the player position.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t + H, position y_{t+H}, but the target is to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1? I think I misread.\n\nLook back:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1, so actions a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, and position at turn t1 + H -1 is (0,9).\n\nStart at turn t1=70, position y_{70} =0.\n\nAfter actions a_{70}, a_{71}, ..., up to a_{70 + H-1}, the position y_{70 + H} is set, but we care about position at turn t1 + H -1 = 70 + H -1.\n\nFor example, after action a_{70}, at turn t=71, position y_{71}.\n\nAfter action a_{71}, at turn t=72, y_{72}, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t=70 + k, position y_{70+k}.\n\nWe want at turn t = 70 + H -1, y_t =9.\n\nt = 70 + H -1, so after (H-1) actions? Let's clarify.\n\nTurn indices: turn t1=70: position y_{t1} = y_{70}\n\nAction a_{t1} = a_{70} determines y_{71}\n\nThen turn t1+1=71: position y_{71}, action a_{71} determines y_{72}, and so on.\n\nAfter m actions, at turn t1 + m, position y_{t1 + m}\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T =9, with T = t1 + H -1.\n\nSo T = 70 + H -1, so y_{70 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe number of actions is H, from a_{70} to a_{70 + H-1}, which determine positions from y_{71} to y_{70 + H}.\n\nBut y_{70} is given, and we care about y_{70 + H -1}.\n\nFor example, with H=1, action a_{70}, then at turn t=70 +1 -1=70, y_{70} should be 9, but y_{70}=0, not 9, so impossible with H=1.\n\nMinimal H: since y=0 to y=9, need at least 9 actions to increase y by 9.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, D decreases, S stays, so to increase by 9, need at least 9 U actions, so H at least 9.\n\nWith H actions, we have positions from y_{70} to y_{70 + H}, but we care about y_{70 + H -1}.\n\nSet k = H -1, then we want y_{70 + k} =9 after k steps? Let's define the step.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn 70, y=0.\n\nAfter 1 action (a_{70}), at turn 71, y_{71}\n\nAfter 2 actions, at turn 72, y_{72}, etc.\n\nAfter j actions, at turn 70 + j, position y_{70+j}\n\nWe want at turn 70 + H -1, y_{70 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo after (H-1) actions, position at turn 70 + (H-1) is 9.\n\nThe position at turn T is after (T - 70) actions from start.\n\nFor turn T, position y_T, which is set by actions up to a_{T-1}, for T>70.\n\ny_{70} given.\n\nFor T=70, no action yet.\n\nAction a_{70} sets y_{71}, a_{71} sets y_{72}, so a_t sets y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions {a_t for t=70 to 70+H-1} determine {y_t for t=71 to 70+H}, but we care about y_{70 + H -1}.\n\ny_{70 + H -1} is determined by actions up to a_{70 + H -2}, I think.\n\nTo have y_{70 + H -1} =9, and it is set by a_{70 + H -2} if H-1 >0.\n\nSince y_{70} =0, we need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe minimal turn to reach y=9 is at least turn 79, since each step increases y by at most 1, so from turn 70 y=0, turn 71 y<=1, ..., turn 79 y<=9, so earliest possible at turn 79 with all U actions.\n\nTurn 70: y=0\n\nTurn 71: y<=1\n\n...\n\nTurn 79: y<=9, and if all U, y=9 at turn 79.\n\nTurn 79 = 70 + 9, so H-1 =9, so H=10.\n\nT = 70 + H -1 =79, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 70, y=0.\n\nAfter 9 actions, at turn 79, y_{79} =9.\n\nActions from a_{70} to a_{78}, 9 actions, H=9? Let's count.\n\nActions: a_{70}, a_{71}, ..., a_{70 + H-1}\n\nNumber of actions: H.\n\nAfter H actions, positions set from y_{71} to y_{70 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{70 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{70 + H -1} is set by the first (H-1) actions? Let's index.\n\nFor turn T=70 + k, position y_{70+k}, which is set by actions a_{70} to a_{69+k}, for k=0, y_{70} given, no action.\n\nFor k=1, y_{71} set by a_{70}\n\nFor k=2, y_{72} set by a_{71}, so for turn T=70 + k, y_T set by a_{T-1} for T>70.\n\nWe want for some T, y_T=9, with T=70 + H -1.\n\nSo T=70 + H -1, so y_{70 + H -1} =9.\n\nThis is set by action a_{70 + H -2} if H-1 >0.\n\nBut to have y_{70 + H -1} =9, and since we start from y_{70}=0, the minimal T is 79, with H-1=9, so H=10.\n\nT=70 + H -1 =79, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nWith H=10, T=79.\n\nIf I can reach y=9 at turn 79 with all U, but I need to avoid collisions at intermediate turns.\n\nTurn 79 is y=9, which is safe, no freeway.\n\nThe issue is the turns when I am on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nFrom above, the dangerous turns are T=70 and T=74 for some rows.\n\nSpecifically, at T=70, rows y=1,2,3,4,5 are occupied, so if I am on them at T=70, I collide, but at T=70, I am on y=0, safe.\n\nAt T=74, rows y=3,4,5 are occupied, so if I am on y=3,4, or 5 at T=74, I collide.\n\nOther times, all rows are safe, except that at T=70, y=1,2,3,4,5 are dangerous, but since I start at y=0, T=70, I am safe.\n\nNow, T=74 is the problem.\n\nI need to not be on y=3,4,5 at turn T=74.\n\ny=6,7,8 are always safe, so I can be there anytime.\n\ny=1 and 2 are only dangerous at T=70, so after that, safe.\n\nTo go from y=0 to y=9, I need to pass through the rows.\n\nWith all U actions: from T=70, y=0\n\nAction a_{70}: U, so y_{71} =1\n\nT=71: at y=1, which is safe because only occupied at T=70, not 71.\n\nAction a_{71}: U, y_{72}=2\n\nT=72: at y=2, safe, not occupied except T=70.\n\na_{72}: U, y_{73}=3\n\nT=73: at y=3. Now, y=3 occupied only at T=70 and T=74, not at T=73, so safe.\n\na_{73}: U, y_{74}=4\n\nT=74: at y=4. But at T=74, y=4 is occupied! Collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf I go to y=4 at T=74, I collide.\n\nSimilarly, if I were on y=3 or y=5 at T=74, also collide.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=74, I am at y=4, which is occupied.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on y=3,4,5 at T=74.\n\nOptions:\n\n1. Be on a different row at T=74.\n\n2. Or, be on y=3,4,5 but not at T=74, but since only dangerous at T=74, I can be at other times.\n\nIn the direct path, I arrive at y=4 at T=74.\n\nI need to delay or advance some actions.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 are always safe, I could go faster to higher rows.\n\nBut I start from y=0.\n\nI could stay or go down at some point to avoid T=74 on middle rows.\n\nT=74 is turn index 74.\n\nFrom start, T=70.\n\nΔt = T - 70.\n\nT=74, Δt=4.\n\nIn the all-up sequence, at Δt=4, T=74, I am at y=4, which is bad.\n\nI need to be at y<=2 or y>=6 at T=74.\n\ny=0,1,2,6,7,8,9 are safe at T=74.\n\ny=0,1,2: but y=1 and 2 are freeways, but at T=74, they are not occupied, as per earlier, only at T=70.\n\nSimilarly, y=6,7,8 safe.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nNow, at T=70, I am at y=0.\n\nI need to plan the path.\n\nTo minimize H, I want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nEarliest possible turn to be at y=9 is turn 79, with all U actions, but that requires being at y=4 at T=74, which is bad.\n\nSo I need to adjust.\n\nI could be at a higher y earlier or later.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 are safe, I can go to them quickly, but I have to go through lower rows first.\n\nI could spend more time on lower rows to avoid T=74 on middle rows.\n\nFor example, at some point, I stay or go down so that at T=74, I am not on y=3,4,5.\n\nThen after that, I can go up.\n\nLet me denote the turn.\n\nI need y_T for T=70 to ...\n\nAt T=70: y=0\n\nNow, actions:\n\nSuppose I want to avoid y=3,4,5 at T=74.\n\nSo for T=74, y should be <=2 or >=6.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly, I should go up as fast as possible except around T=74.\n\nFirst, from T=70 to T=73, I can go up.\n\nT=70: y=0, safe.\n\nAction a_{70}: U, so y_{71}=1\n\nT=71: y=1, safe (not occupied)\n\nAction a_{71}: U, y_{72}=2\n\nT=72: y=2, safe\n\nAction a_{72}: U, y_{73}=3\n\nT=73: y=3, safe (since occupied at T=70 and T=74, not T=73)\n\nNow at T=73, y=3.\n\nAction a_{73}: if I go U, y_{74}=4, but at T=74 y=4 collide.\n\nIf I go S, y_{74}=3, at T=74 y=3 collide.\n\nIf I go D, y_{74}=2, then at T=74 y=2, which is safe, since y=2 not occupied at T=74.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut y=2 at T=74.\n\nThen action a_{74}: U, y_{75}=3\n\nT=75: y=3, now safe, since not T=74.\n\nSimilarly, I can go up.\n\nBut I have lost one step by going down or staying.\n\nLet's compute the turns.\n\nStart: T=70, y=0\n\na70: U, y71=1\n\na71: U, y72=2\n\na72: U, y73=3\n\na73: D, y74=2  (avoid collision)\n\nT=74: y=2, safe\n\na74: U, y75=3\n\nT=75: y=3, safe\n\na75: U, y76=4\n\nT=76: y=4, safe\n\na76: U, y77=5\n\nT=77: y=5, safe\n\na77: U, y78=6\n\nT=78: y=6, safe (y=6 always safe)\n\na78: U, y79=7\n\nT=79: y=7, safe\n\na79: U, y80=8\n\nT=80: y=8, safe\n\na80: U, y81=9\n\nT=81: y=9, reached.\n\nBut at T=81, which is 70 + H -1 =81, so 70 + H -1 =81, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nBut we want at turn T=70 + H -1, y=9.\n\nHere T=81, so 70 + H -1 =81, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nBut earlier with all U but avoiding T=74, I reach at T=81.\n\nBut I could reach earlier.\n\nAt T=79, with all U, y=9, but I had to avoid T=74.\n\nIn all U, I would be at y=4 at T=74, which is bad.\n\nBut if I can be at y=5 or y=3 at T=74? No, all bad.\n\ny=3,4,5 all bad at T=74.\n\nSo I need to not be on them at that turn.\n\nAnother option: go faster to higher rows.\n\nFrom T=70, y=0, I can only increase by 1 per turn, so at T=71, y=1; T=72, y=2; T=73, y=3; T=74, y=4 if up. Cannot be higher.\n\nUnless I start from y=0, I can only reach y=4 at T=74 with all U.\n\nTo be at y=6 at T=74, for example, I need to be at y=6 at turn 74.\n\nBut from y=0 at T=70, to y=6 at T=74, I need to increase by 6 in 4 turns? From T=70 to T=74, that's 4 turns of actions? Positions.\n\nAt T=70: y=0\n\nAfter a70: T=71, y=?\n\nTo have y_{74} =6.\n\ny_{74} is set by actions up to a_{73}.\n\nActions: a_{70}, a_{71}, a_{72}, a_{73} determine y_{71}, y_{72}, y_{73}, y_{74}.\n\ny_{71} = y_{70} + Δy_{70} = 0 + a_{70} (U: +1, D: -1, S:0)\n\nSimilarly, y_{72} = y_{71} + Δy_{71}\n\ny_{73} = y_{72} + Δy_{72}\n\ny_{74} = y_{73} + Δy_{73}\n\nSo to have y_{74} =6, and y_{70}=0, the sum of Δy from t=70 to 73 must be +6.\n\nSince each Δy is -1,0,1, so I need to have +6 in 4 actions, which requires at least 6 U and no D, but only 4 actions, each can give at most +1, so maximum increase is 4, to y=4 at T=74.\n\nImpossible to be at y=6 at T=74.\n\nSimilarly, minimum is y=0 if all S or D, but y=6 requires at least 6 steps.\n\nEarliest to be at y=6 is T=76: with all U, T=70 y=0, T=71 y=1, ..., T=76 y=6.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=2 at T=74, I can, for example, by going slower or down.\n\nBut in any case, at T=74, I can be at y=0,1,2,6,7,8,9 but y=6,7,8 not reachable until later.\n\nAt T=74, possible y from 0 to 4, since from start with 4 actions, max y=4.\n\nSimilarly, min y= -4, but y>=0, so y=0 to 4.\n\nSo at T=74, I can be at y=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nAmong these, y=3 and y=4 are dangerous at T=74 (y=5 also, but y=5 not reachable until later? At T=74, y<=4, so y=3 and y=4 are dangerous, y=0,1,2 are safe.\n\ny=0 is safe, y=1 and y=2 are freeways but not occupied at T=74, so safe.\n\nSo at T=74, to be safe, I must be at y=0,1, or 2.\n\nIn the all-up path, I am at y=4 at T=74, which is bad.\n\nTo be at y=2 at T=74, for example.\n\nThen from there, I can go up to y=9.\n\nNow, let's compute the turn to reach y=9.\n\nIf I am at y=2 at T=74, then I need to go to y=9, which takes at least 7 more steps: to y=3 at T=75, y=4 at T=76, ..., up to y=9 at T=81? Let's see.\n\nT=74: y=2\n\nAction a_{74}: U, y_{75}=3\n\nT=75: y=3, safe\n\na_{75}: U, y_{76}=4\n\nT=76: y=4, safe\n\na_{76}: U, y_{77}=5\n\nT=77: y=5, safe\n\na_{77}: U, y_{78}=6\n\nT=78: y=6, safe\n\na_{78}: U, y_{79}=7\n\nT=79: y=7, safe\n\na_{79}: U, y_{80}=8\n\nT=80: y=8, safe\n\na_{80}: U, y_{81}=9\n\nT=81: y=9\n\nSame as before, T=81.\n\nBut I reached y=2 at T=74, which took some turns.\n\nHow did I get to y=2 at T=74?\n\nFrom start, with actions.\n\nFor example, to be at y=2 at T=74.\n\ny_{74} = y_{70} + sum_{t=70 to 73} Δy_t\n\ny_{70} =0, so y_{74} = sum of Δy for t=70,71,72,73.\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, y_{74} =2, so sum of 4 Δy must be +2.\n\nFor instance, two U and two S, or one U and one D and two S? Sum +2 with four actions.\n\nPossible: two U and two S: net +2\n\nOr three U and one D: +3-1=+2\n\nOr one U and three S? +1, not +2.\n\nTwo U and two S: +2+0=+2\n\nThree U and one D: +3-1=+2\n\nFour U: +4, too much.\n\nSo options.\n\nIn terms of turns, I need to have y_{74}=2.\n\nThen from above, to y=9 at T=81.\n\nBut with all U, if no problem, I could be at y=9 at T=79.\n\nBut with the delay, T=81.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=2 earlier or something.\n\nAnother idea: after T=74, I can go faster, but since I have to increase y, and each step at least one turn, cannot be faster than one per step.\n\nUnless I go up multiple, but no, only +1 per U.\n\nSo from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps, to T=81.\n\nBut at T=74 I am at y=2, which is after 4 actions, but position at T=74.\n\nPerhaps I can reach a higher y before T=74, but impossible, max y=4 at T=74.\n\ny=4 is bad at T=74.\n\ny=3 also bad.\n\nSo I must be at y<=2 at T=74.\n\nThen the earliest to reach y=9 is from y=2 at T=74, then 7 steps to y=9 at T=81.\n\nT=81 = 70 + 11, so 70 + H -1 =81, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=1 or y=0 at T=74, then from there to y=9 takes more steps.\n\ny=0 at T=74: then to y=9, 9 steps, to T=83, worse.\n\nSo best to be at y=2 at T=74.\n\nThen from T=74 y=2 to T=81 y=9.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach y=2 at T=74 with fewer actions, but I have to take actions to get there.\n\nSince I start at y=0, to be at y=2 at T=74, I need to have moved up, but not too fast.\n\nIn the process, I can be on other rows at other times, but since only T=74 is dangerous for middle rows, and other times safe, I just need to not be on y=3,4,5 at T=74.\n\nIn the path above, when I go to y=3 at T=73, then I go down to y=2 at T=74.\n\nBut at T=73, I was at y=3, which is safe, since not T=74.\n\nThen a_{73}: D, to y=2 at T=74.\n\nI could have stayed at lower rows longer.\n\nFor example, suppose at T=70: y=0\n\na_{70}: S, y_{71}=0\n\nT=71: y=0, safe\n\nBut y=0 is safe, but I am not moving up.\n\nThen a_{71}: U, y_{72}=1\n\nT=72: y=1, safe\n\na_{72}: U, y_{73}=2\n\nT=73: y=2, safe\n\na_{73}: S, y_{74}=2  (stay at y=2 for T=74)\n\nThen same as before, y=2 at T=74.\n\nThen from there up.\n\nBut I used a S at T=70, so I am still at y=0 at T=71, then to y=1 at T=72, y=2 at T=73, y=2 at T=74.\n\nThen from T=74 y=2 to y=9 at T=81, same as before.\n\nIf I go directly: a_{70}: U, y71=1\n\na71: U, y72=2\n\na72: S, y73=2  (at T=73 y=2)\n\na73: S, y74=2  (at T=74 y=2)\n\nThen a74: U, etc., to T=81 y=9.\n\nBut at T=73 I am at y=2, which is fine, but I could have gone to y=3 at T=73, which is also fine, then down to y=2 at T=74.\n\nIn terms of reaching y=9, it's the same, T=81.\n\nBut in the first way, I was at y=3 at T=73, which is safe, then down.\n\nNow, to minimize H, since H=12 in both cases.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach y=9 earlier if I can be at a higher y after T=74.\n\nBut after T=74, no danger, so I can go straight up.\n\nThe bottleneck is that I need to be at low y at T=74 to avoid collision, so I delay the ascent.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y=9 before T=81?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=5 at T=75 or something.\n\nBut at T=74, I am at y=2, then T=75 y=3, T=76 y=4, T=77 y=5, T=78 y=6, T=79 y=7, T=80 y=8, T=81 y=9. Cannot be faster.\n\nUnless I start from a higher y, but I start from y=0.\n\nAnother idea: go down at some point to save time, but going down would make it worse.\n\nFor example, from T=70, go U to y=1 at T=71, then U to y=2 at T=72, then instead of U, go D to y=1 at T=73, then at T=74, if I am at y=1, safe, then I need to go up from there, but y=1 at T=74, then to y=9, 8 steps, to T=82, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, minimal to be at y=2 at T=74, then reach y=9 at T=81 with H=12.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn.\n\nWe need y_{70 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt T=81, y=9, so 70 + H -1 =81, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions from a_{70} to a_{81}? a_{70} to a_{70 + H-1} = a_{70} to a_{81}, but H=12, a_{70} to a_{81} is 12 actions? Indices from 70 to 81 inclusive is 12 actions? 81-70+1=12.\n\nBut after a_{81}, y_{82} is set, but we don't care.\n\nThe position at turn 70 + H -1 =70+12-1=81, y_{81}=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, with actions:\n\nOne possible sequence:\n\nT=70: y=0, action a_{70}=U, so y_{71}=1\n\nT=71: y=1, action a_{71}=U, y_{72}=2\n\nT=72: y=2, action a_{72}=U, y_{73}=3\n\nT=73: y=3, action a_{73}=D, y_{74}=2  (down to avoid)\n\nT=74: y=2, safe, action a_{74}=U, y_{75}=3\n\nT=75: y=3, safe, a_{75}=U, y_{76}=4\n\nT=76: y=4, safe, a_{76}=U, y_{77}=5\n\nT=77: y=5, safe, a_{77}=U, y_{78}=6\n\nT=78: y=6, safe, a_{78}=U, y_{79}=7\n\nT=79: y=7, safe, a_{79}=U, y_{80}=8\n\nT=80: y=8, safe, a_{80}=U, y_{81}=9\n\nT=81: y=9, reached.\n\nActions from a_{70} to a_{80}, that's 11 actions? a_{70}, a_{71}, a_{72}, a_{73}, a_{74}, a_{75}, a_{76}, a_{77}, a_{78}, a_{79}, a_{80} — that's 11 actions.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=0 to H-1 for the sequence index, but in terms of turns, actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}.\n\nHere t1=70, actions a_{70} to a_{70+H-1}.\n\nAfter H actions, the position at turn t1 + H is set, but we care about turn t1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, with 11 actions: a_{70} to a_{80}, which determine y_{71} to y_{81}.\n\ny_{81} is set by a_{80}, and at turn t=81, y=9.\n\nt=81 = t1 + H -1 =70 + H -1, so 70 + H -1 =81, thus H-1=11, H=12.\n\nBut I have only 11 actions above: from a70 to a80, that's 11 actions.\n\na70, a71, a72, a73, a74, a75, a76, a77, a78, a79, a80 — that's 11 actions.\n\nBut H should be 12? Inconsistency.\n\nNumber of actions: from a_{70} to a_{80} inclusive: 80 - 70 + 1 = 11 actions.\n\nAfter 11 actions, positions from y_{71} to y_{81}.\n\ny_{81} at turn 81.\n\nt1 + H -1 =70 + H -1 =81, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nSo I need 12 actions? But with 11 actions I reached y_{81}=9.\n\nPerhaps I need to include the action for the last position.\n\nLet's list the turns and positions:\n\nTurn 70: position y=0 (given, no action yet)\n\nAction a_{70}: determines y_{71}\n\nTurn 71: y_{71}, action a_{71}: determines y_{72}\n\n...\n\nTurn 80: y_{80}, action a_{80}: determines y_{81}\n\nTurn 81: y_{81}\n\nWe want turn 81 to have y=9, which is set by a_{80}.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from a_{70} to a_{80} for H=11 actions? But H should be such that turn t1 + H -1 has y=9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =81, t1=70, so 70 + H -1 =81, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nWith H=12 actions, from a_{70} to a_{81}, then turn t1 + H -1 =70 +12-1=81, y_{81} should be 9.\n\nBut y_{81} is determined by a_{80}, not directly by a_{81}.\n\na_{81} would determine y_{82}, which is after.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 81 to have y=9, it must be set by a_{80}, so the last action is a_{80}.\n\nThe actions are a_{70} to a_{80}, for 11 actions, but H=11, then t1 + H -1 =70 +11-1=80, so at turn 80, y should be 9.\n\nBut in the path, at turn 80, y=8, not 9.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nAt turn 80: y=8, then action a_{80}=U, so y_{81}=9 at turn 81.\n\nSo at turn 80, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y=9 at turn 80, I need to be at y=9 at turn 80.\n\nTurn 80: y=9.\n\nThen from start, how?\n\nAt turn 70: y=0\n\nTo turn 80: y=9, that's 10 steps? Turns from 70 to 80, that's 10 turns, but positions.\n\ny_{80} = y_{70} + sum_{t=70 to 79} Δy_t\n\ny_{70}=0, so y_{80} = sum of 10 Δy from t=70 to 79.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so y_{80} <=10, but y<=9, so possible with 9 U and one S, for example.\n\nBut in terms of time, turn 80 is earlier than 81.\n\nIn my collision avoidance, I need to not be on y=3,4,5 at T=74.\n\nT=74 is turn 74.\n\nIn the path to y=9 at turn 80.\n\nFirst, with all U except where needed.\n\nBut at T=74, I must not be on y=3,4,5.\n\nTurn 74 is fixed.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 at turn 80, I need y_{80}=9.\n\nSince y_{70}=0, I need net +9 in 10 actions (from a_{70} to a_{79}).\n\nActions from a_{70} to a_{79} determine y_{71} to y_{80}.\n\n10 actions.\n\ny_{80} = sum of Δy from t=70 to 79.\n\nSet to 9.\n\nNow, at turn T=74, which is y_{74}, must be 0,1,2, or 6,7,8,9 but 6+ not possible, so must be 0,1,2.\n\ny_{74} <=4 as before.\n\nMust be <=2.\n\nNow, the actions from t=70 to 73 determine y_{74}.\n\ny_{74} = sum_{t=70 to 73} Δy_t\n\nMust be <=2.\n\nThen from y_{74} to y_{80}, 6 actions (a_{74} to a_{79}), need to increase to 9, so need net + (9 - y_{74}) <= 9 - 0 =9, but since y_{74} >=0, min increase 7 if y_{74}=2, max 9 if y_{74}=0.\n\nBut with 6 actions, max increase 6, to y_{80} = y_{74} +6.\n\nIf y_{74} <=2, then y_{80} <= 2 +6 =8 <9, cannot reach y=9 at turn 80.\n\nIf y_{74} =2, y_{80} <=8.\n\nIf y_{74}=1, y_{80}<=7, worse.\n\nSo impossible to have y_{80}=9 if y_{74} <=2.\n\nBut to avoid collision, y_{74} must be <=2.\n\nThus, cannot have y=9 at turn 80; earliest possible is turn 81 with y_{74}=2, y_{81}=9.\n\nSimilarly, if y_{74}=1, y_{81} <=1+7=8, not 9, need y_{82}=9, later.\n\nSo best is y_{74}=2, then y_{81}=9 with H=12.\n\nH=12 actions: a_{70} to a_{81}? Let's define.\n\nWith a_{70} to a_{80}, 11 actions, y_{71} to y_{81}, and at turn 81, y=9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =70 + H -1 =81, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nBut actions from a_{70} to a_{81}, that would be 12 actions, determining y_{71} to y_{82}.\n\nBut we need y_{81}=9, which is determined by a_{80}, so a_{81} is not needed.\n\nThe sequence should be actions up to a_{80} for y_{81}=9.\n\nIn the answer, the actions are from t=0 to H-1 for the sequence, but with t starting from t1.\n\nIn the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t1 +0} = a_{70}, t=1, a_{71}, ..., up to t=H-1, a_{t1 + H-1}\n\nThen after these H actions, position at turn t1 + H is set, but we care about position at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nFor turn t1 + H -1 to have y=9.\n\nIn terms of the last action, if turn t1 + H -1 has y=9, then the actions up to a_{t1 + H -2} set y_{t1 + H -1}, and a_{t1 + H -1} sets y_{t1 + H}, which may not be used.\n\nIn the sequence, we include actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nFor example, to have y_{81}=9 at turn 81, which is t1 + H -1 =81, t1=70, so 70 + H -1=81, H=12.\n\nThen actions from a_{70} to a_{70+11} = a_{81}, but a_{81} sets y_{82}, not y_{81}.\n\ny_{81} is set by a_{80}.\n\nSo the action a_{t1 + H -1} = a_{81} sets y_{82}, but we don't care about y_{82}.\n\nTo have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, we need actions up to a_{t1 + H -2}.\n\nThe sequence should be from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2} for H-1 actions? I'm confused.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that the number of actions H corresponds to the number of steps to reach the position.\n\nSince at turn t1, position is given, after H actions, we are at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}, but we want at turn t1 + H -1 position 9.\n\nIn practice, for the sequence, we list actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2} to set y_{t1 + H -1}, and the last action is included if it affects, but in the format, we list actions for turns t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nI think for this problem, since we need to specify actions from the current turn.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t1}\" up to \"Turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t1 + H -1}\"\n\nAnd after these H actions, the position at turn t1 + H is set, but we want position at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nSo for position at turn K to be 9, we need actions up to a_{K-1}.\n\nSet K = t1 + H -1, so we want position at K=9.\n\nThen actions from a_{t1} to a_{K-1} determine y_{t1+1} to y_{K}.\n\nBut y_K is determined by a_{K-1}.\n\nThe actions listed should be from a_{t1} to a_{K-1}, which is from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2}.\n\nBut in the sequence, it is indexed as t=0 to H-1 for a_{t1 + t}, so for t from 0 to H-1, actions a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nThen after these, position at turn t1 + H is set.\n\nBut we want position at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nSo for turn t1 + H -1, y must be 9, which is set by the first H-1 actions? Messy.\n\nPerhaps for turn t1 + H -1 to have y=9, the actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2} set y_{t1 + H -1}, and the last action a_{t1 + H -1} sets y_{t1 + H}, which is not constrained.\n\nIn the sequence, we include a_{t1 + H -1} as well, but it doesn't affect the position at t1 + H -1.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's use the sequence from my first plan.\n\nActions: a_{70} to a_{80} (11 actions), then at turn 81, y=9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =70 + H -1 =81, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nThen the actions should be from a_{70} to a_{70 + 11} = a_{81}, but a_{81} is extra.\n\nI think there's a mistake in the indexing.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 11, with turn 80 y=9.\n\nBut earlier we saw it's impossible because of y_{74} <=2.\n\nAssume that at turn 80, y=9 is possible only if no collision avoidance, but with avoidance, we need turn 81.\n\nIn the car states, is there any other danger?\n\nFor example, on y=6,7,8, always safe, so after T=74, no issue.\n\nBut at T=74, we must be at low y.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=5 at T=75 immediately after, but still, from y=2 at T=74 to y=5 at T=75 requires +3, impossible.\n\nSo I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nAnother sequence with H=12.\n\nActions:\n\nStart: turn 70, y=0\n\na_{70}: U, so turn 71 y=1\n\na_{71}: U, turn 72 y=2\n\na_{72}: U, turn 73 y=3\n\na_{73}: D, turn 74 y=2  (down to avoid T=74 on y=3)\n\na_{74}: U, turn 75 y=3\n\na_{75}: U, turn 76 y=4\n\na_{76}: U, turn 77 y=5\n\na_{77}: U, turn 78 y=6\n\na_{78}: U, turn 79 y=7\n\na_{79}: U, turn 80 y=8\n\na_{80}: U, turn 81 y=9\n\nNow, at turn 81, y=9.\n\nThe actions are from a_{70} to a_{80}, that's 11 actions.\n\nBut for H=12, we need to list up to a_{81}.\n\nPerhaps a_{81} is not needed, but to have 12 actions, we can add a dummy action, but the position is already reached at turn 81.\n\nThe problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" to reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, with actions a_{70} to a_{80}, 11 actions, we have y_{81}=9 at turn 81.\n\nt1 + H -1 =70 + H -1 =81, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nThen the sequence should include a_{70} to a_{81}, but a_{81} determines y_{82}, which is not used.\n\nPerhaps we can set a_{81} to S or something, but it's unnecessary.\n\nI think in practice, for the sequence, we list the actions that are taken until the position is reached.\n\nSince at turn 81, y=9, and it is set by a_{80}, so the last action is a_{80}.\n\nThe actions are from a_{70} to a_{80} for 11 actions, but H=11, then turn t1 + H -1 =70+11-1=80, so at turn 80, y should be 9, but in the sequence, at turn 80, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y=9 at turn 80, I need different timing.\n\nSuppose I reach y=9 at turn 80.\n\nThen y_{80}=9.\n\nFrom y_{70}=0, so in 10 actions from a_{70} to a_{79}, y_{80} = sum Δy from 70 to 79 =9.\n\nNow, at turn 74, y_{74} must be 0,1,2.\n\ny_{74} is determined by actions up to a_{73}, y_{74} = sum Δy from 70 to 73.\n\nThen y_{80} = y_{74} + sum Δy from 74 to 79.\n\nsum Δy from 74 to 79 is 6 actions, so y_{80} = y_{74} + S, where S <=6.\n\nIf y_{74} <=2, then y_{80} <=2+6=8<9, impossible.\n\nTherefore, cannot have y_{80}=9; must have y_{81}=9 with y_{74}=2, y_{80}=8, then a_{80}=U to y_{81}=9.\n\nThus H=12 with actions a_{70} to a_{80}, and the sequence has 11 actions, but H=12 includes the turn.\n\nI think I should accept H=12 with the sequence above.\n\nPerhaps the answer expects the actions for the turns.\n\nLet's list the actions for each turn.\n\nTurn 70: action a_{70} = U  (to y=1 at next turn)\n\nTurn 71: a_{71} = U  (y=2)\n\nTurn 72: a_{72} = U  (y=3)\n\nTurn 73: a_{73} = D  (y=2, to avoid being at y=3 or 4 at T=74)\n\nTurn 74: a_{74} = U  (y=3)\n\nTurn 75: a_{75} = U  (y=4)\n\nTurn 76: a_{76} = U  (y=5)\n\nTurn 77: a_{77} = U  (y=6)\n\nTurn 78: a_{78} = U  (y=7)\n\nTurn 79: a_{79} = U  (y=8)\n\nTurn 80: a_{80} = U  (y=9 at turn 81)\n\nNow, the actions are from turn 70 to turn 80, that's 11 turns of actions.\n\nFor turn 81, no action needed, position is reached.\n\nBut in the sequence, we list actions from t=70 to t=80 for H=11 actions? But H=11, turn t1 + H -1 =70+11-1=80, but at turn 80, y=8, not 9.\n\nWe need to include the action for turn 81, but at turn 81, if we are already at y=9, we can choose S or something, but the position is reached before the action.\n\nThe safest is to list the actions until the position is reached at turn 81 with the last action at turn 80.\n\nIn the answer format, for H=12, actions from a_{70} to a_{81}.\n\nFor a_{81}, we can set it to S, for example, but it doesn't affect.\n\nBut in this case, at turn 81, y=9, and we take a_{81}=S, so y_{82}=9, but we don't care.\n\nTo be consistent, let's do that.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: D\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U  (now at turn 81, y=9)\n\nTurn 81: S  (arbitrary, since position reached)\n\nBut H=12 actions.\n\nWith a_{81}=S, but it's not necessary.\n\nSince the position is reached at turn 81, and we take action at turn 81, which is for the next turn.\n\nBut in the task, once we reach (0,9), we stop, but the sequence includes actions until we reach.\n\nI think for the purpose, we can have the sequence with 11 actions and H=11, but then the turn is 80, not 81.\n\nBut with H=11, turn t1 + H -1 =70+11-1=80, y must be 9 at turn 80, which we can't achieve with collision avoidance.\n\nTherefore, we must have H=12 with turn 81 y=9.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have a down action at turn 73.\n\nBut is there a sequence without down? For example, stay at lower rows.\n\nLike:\n\nTurn 70: U, y71=1\n\nTurn 71: U, y72=2\n\nTurn 72: S, y73=2  (at T=73 y=2)\n\nTurn 73: S, y74=2  (at T=74 y=2, safe)\n\nThen Turn 74: U, y75=3\n\nTurn 75: U, y76=4\n\nTurn 76: U, y77=5\n\nTurn 77: U, y78=6\n\nTurn 78: U, y79=7\n\nTurn 79: U, y80=8\n\nTurn 80: U, y81=9\n\nThen Turn 81: S (say)\n\nBut same number of actions.\n\nWith S instead of D, but H same.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nH=12.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: D  (to avoid)\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: S  (since at y=9, stay)\n\nBut at turn 81, y=9, we can choose any action, but S is fine.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 81, we need to specify an action, but since we reached, it can be S.\n\nPerhaps we can end with turn 80 action, but to match H=12.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nAnother way: since y=6,7,8 are safe, after T=74, I can go up, but no faster.\n\nSo minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let's confirm the car at T=74.\n\nFor example, on freeway 3 at T=74, occupied, as we had.\n\nIn freeway 8, it was always safe, etc.\n\nSo I think correct.\n\nSo the sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: D\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: S\n\nBut for Turn 81, since y=9, and we are at (0,9), we can stop, but the action is required for the sequence.\n\nTo avoid the extra action, perhaps H=11 with turn 80, but impossible.\n\nSo I'll go with H=12.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 70\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 12. This sequence ensures that the player is not on freeways \\(y = 3, 4, 5\\) at turn 74 (when these freeways are occupied by cars) and reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 81 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 70 + 12 - 1 = 81\\)).\n\nThe car states indicate that:\n- Freeways \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\) are occupied only at turn 70, so they are safe for \\(t > 70\\).\n- Freeways \\(y = 3, 4, 5\\) are occupied at turns 70 and 74, so they are safe except at these turns.\n- Freeways \\(y = 6, 7, 8\\) are never occupied at \\(x = 0\\), so they are always safe.\n\nThe sequence avoids being on \\(y = 3, 4, 5\\) at turn 74 by moving down to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 74. After turn 74, all freeways are safe, allowing the player to move up directly to \\(y = 9\\).\n\n**Action Sequence (minimizes \\(H = 12\\)):**\n\n- At turn 70, move up to \\(y = 1\\) (safe, as \\(y = 1\\) is only occupied at turn 70).\n- At turn 71, move up to \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as \\(y = 2\\) is only occupied at turn 70).\n- At turn 72, move up to \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as \\(y = 3\\) is occupied at turns 70 and 74, not 72).\n- At turn 73, move down to \\(y = 2\\) to avoid being on \\(y = 3, 4, 5\\) at turn 74.\n- At turn 74, at \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as \\(y = 2\\) not occupied), then move up to \\(y = 3\\).\n- From turns 75 to 80, move up each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 81.\n- At turn 81, the position (0, 9) is reached, and the action is stay (S) as no further movement is needed.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 70: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 71: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 72: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 73: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 74: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 75: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 76: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 77: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 78: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 79: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 80: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 81: \\text{S} \\end{array} }",

The current turn is t_1 = 74, and I'm at y=0.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For left-moving cars, the span moves left with speed s, so at turn T, the span is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]. Since it's left-moving, head is at the right, so for left-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I think? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]. But typically, for a car moving left, the head would be on the left? I'm confused by the notation.\n\nLooking back: \"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the left-moving case, [h, τ] with h and τ, but it doesn't specify which is head or tail. But it says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\", so for left-moving, head is at h, tail at τ, so if it's moving left, head should be the front, so if moving left, head should be larger x if x increases right? But the freeway is on y, but the x-axis is the horizontal, I think.\n\nThe grid is 2D, but the player is always at x=0, moving vertically. The cars are on horizontal freeways at each y level, moving horizontally, so collision happens when the car's span includes x=0 at the turn when the player is on that y level.\n\nFor a car on freeway i, at turn T, if the player is on y_T = i, and at that turn, the car's span includes x=0, then collision.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1=74.\n\nAlso, when you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you might move to y_{T+1}, but you are not on y_{T+1} until the next turn.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in Span(T) but not in Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut since you move at turn T, at turn T you are on y_T, and you take action to go to y_{T+1}, so during turn T, you are on y_T, so you only care about cars on y_T at that turn for collision.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn T based on where you are at that turn, y_T, and the cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe car positions are updated based on time from t_1.\n\nLet me denote ΔT = T - t_1 for simplicity.\n\nt_1 = 74.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at turn 74.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, say turn 74 + H - 1, so after H-1 actions, I'm at y=9.\n\nLet the turns be relative: let t=0 be turn t_1, so at t=0, y=0.\n\nThen at time t (turn t_1 + t), position y_t.\n\nI need to find actions a_t for t=0 to H-1 such that y_H = 9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t_1 + t for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nAt turn t_1 + t, I take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nDefine the state at the beginning of turn.\n\nAt turn t_1, position is (0,0), I take action a_{t_1}, which moves me to y_1 at turn t_1 +1.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nAnd a_t is taken at turn t.\n\nSo at turn t, I am at y_t, I take a_t, then I move to y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn t based on y_t and the cars on freeway y_t at that turn.\n\nFor turn t, which is turn t_1 + τ for some τ.\n\nSet t_abs = t_1 + t, with t starting from 0.\n\nAt absolute turn T, y_T is position.\n\nFor T = t_1 + t, with t=0,1,2,...\n\nAt T, y_T, cars on freeway k at turn T are given by their span.\n\nFor a car, at turn T, span is:\n\nFor left-moving: [h - s (T - t_1), τ - s (T - t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s (T - t_1), h + s (T - t_1)]\n\nAnd collision if y_T = k and 0 is in the span for some car on k.\n\nNow, the cars are listed per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1 to 8, but y=0 and y=9 have no cars, I assume, since only freeways 1-8 have cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nI start at y=0 at turn 74, so at turn 74, I am on y=0, no cars, so no collision.\n\nThen I need to get to y=9.\n\nActions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same).\n\ny must be in 0 to 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 in min turns.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nNow, let's list the car states at t_1=74.\n\nFreeway k=1: one car: (h=48, τ=83, d=left, s=36)  ? Head and tail.\n\nFor left-moving, head at h, tail at τ, but if it's moving left, and head is at 48, tail at 83, but 48 < 83, so if x increases right, head at 48, tail at 83, so tail is to the right, which means the car is facing left, so head is left, tail right.\n\nThen span is from min to max? [h, τ] = [48,83], but since h=48, τ=83, so left end is 48, right end is 83.\n\nThen moving left, so at time T, span [48 - 36ΔT, 83 - 36ΔT]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn general, for left-moving, span at T: [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], with h and τ as given.\n\nBut in this case, for k=1, h=48, τ=83, s=36, left.\n\nAt T, [48 - 36(ΔT), 83 - 36(ΔT)]\n\nSimilarly, k=2: same as k=1: (48,83,left,36)\n\nk=3: three cars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nFirst car: (h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12)  head at 48, tail at 37, so since right-moving, head is right, tail left, so span from τ to h, [37,48] at t_1.\n\nThen at T: [37 + 12ΔT, 48 + 12ΔT]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (h=12, τ=1, right, s=12), span at t_1 [1,12], at T [1 + 12ΔT, 12 + 12ΔT]\n\nThird car: (h=-24, τ=-35, right, s=12), span at t_1 [-35,-24], at T [-35 + 12ΔT, -24 + 12ΔT]\n\nk=4: same as k=3: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nk=5: same as k=3 and 4.\n\nk=6: one car: (48,37,right,6)  so (h=48, τ=37, right, s=6), span at T [37 + 6ΔT, 48 + 6ΔT]\n\nk=7: same as k=6: (48,37,right,6)\n\nk=8: two cars: (48,37,right,6), and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (h=48, τ=37, right, s=6), span at T [37 + 6ΔT, 48 + 6ΔT]\n\nSecond car: (h=0, τ=-11, right, s=6), so at t_1, head at 0, tail at -11, moving right, span [ -11, 0] at t_1? For right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-11 + 6ΔT, 0 + 6ΔT]\n\nNow, collision when at turn T, I am on freeway k, and for some car on k, 0 in [low, high] of span at T.\n\nSince the player is at x=0 always.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9, moving up, down, or stay, min steps.\n\nBut with constraints on when I can be on each y=1 to 8 without collision.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nI need to find a path and actions.\n\nSince I can move up or down, I might need to wait or go down sometimes, but since I start at 0 and need to go to 9, probably up is better, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway k, at what times T it is safe to be on k, i.e., no car has 0 in span.\n\nSince the cars move linearly, the unsafe times are when for some car, the span covers 0.\n\nFor each car, we can find the time interval when 0 is in its span.\n\nThen for each freeway, the safe times are when none of the cars cover 0.\n\nThen I need to plan a sequence of moves such that when I am on y_t at turn t, it is safe for that y_t at that turn.\n\nt is absolute turn.\n\nSet t_1=74 as reference.\n\nLet ΔT = T - 74, so at ΔT=0, current time.\n\nFor each freeway, find for which ΔT it is safe.\n\nStart with k=1.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, left-moving, s=36, h=48, τ=83 at ΔT=0.\n\nSpan at ΔT: [48 - 36ΔT, 83 - 36ΔT]\n\n0 in span when 48 - 36ΔT <= 0 <= 83 - 36ΔT\n\nSince 48 - 36ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= 83 - 36ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36ΔT <= 0 => 48 <= 36ΔT => ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 83 - 36ΔT => 36ΔT <= 83 => ΔT <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSo unsafe when ΔT in [4/3, 83/36] ≈ [1.333, 2.305]\n\nSince ΔT integer (turns), unsafe for ΔT = 2, since at ΔT=1: 48-36=12, 83-36=47, both positive, 0 not in [12,47]\n\nAt ΔT=2: 48-72= -24, 83-72=11, so [ -24, 11], 0 in it.\n\nAt ΔT=3: 48-108= -60, 83-108= -25, [ -60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe only at ΔT=2.\n\nSimilarly, k=2 same as k=1, unsafe only at ΔT=2.\n\nNow k=3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: right-moving, h=48, τ=37, s=12, span at ΔT: [37 + 12ΔT, 48 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span: 37 + 12ΔT <= 0 <= 48 + 12ΔT\n\nBut 37 + 12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <= -37, impossible since ΔT>=0, left end min 37>0, so always positive, 0 never in span.\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=12, τ=1, s=12, span [1 + 12ΔT, 12 + 12ΔT] = [1+12ΔT, 12(1+ΔT)] since 12+12ΔT=12(1+ΔT)\n\nAlways >=1 >0 for ΔT>=0, so 0 never in span.\n\nThird car: h=-24, τ=-35, s=12, span [-35 + 12ΔT, -24 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -35 + 12ΔT <= 0 <= -24 + 12ΔT\n\nFirst: -35 +12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +12ΔT => 24 <=12ΔT => ΔT >= 2\n\nSo 2 <= ΔT <= 2.916, so for integer ΔT, unsafe at ΔT=2 and ΔT=3? Let's see:\n\nAt ΔT=2: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included, since <= and >=, probably inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, at ΔT=3: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nAt ΔT=2: low = -35+24= -11, high= -24+24=0, so 0 <= high, and low <=0, so 0 in [ -11, 0].\n\nAt ΔT=1: -35+12= -23, -24+12= -12, [ -23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nAt ΔT=3: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe only at ΔT=2 for this car? But there are three cars, but first two never unsafe, only third unsafe at ΔT=2.\n\nAt ΔT=2, third car has [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nFor k=3, at ΔT=2, unsafe because of third car.\n\nAt other times, safe, since other cars don't cover 0.\n\nSimilarly, k=4 same as k=3, unsafe only at ΔT=2.\n\nk=5 same, unsafe only at ΔT=2.\n\nNow k=6: one car, (48,37,right,6), so h=48, τ=37, right, s=6.\n\nSpan at ΔT: [37 + 6ΔT, 48 + 6ΔT]\n\nBoth ends positive for ΔT>=0, min 37>0, so 0 never in span, always safe.\n\nSimilarly k=7 same, always safe.\n\nk=8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6), same as k=6, always safe, 0 never in span.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6), h=0, τ=-11, right-moving.\n\nSpan at ΔT: for right-moving, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-11 + 6ΔT, 0 + 6ΔT] = [-11+6ΔT, 6ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -11+6ΔT <= 0 <= 6ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -11+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=11 => ΔT <= 11/6 ≈1.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= 6ΔT always true for ΔT>=0? 0 <= 6ΔT, since ΔT>=0, 6ΔT >=0, so 0 <= 6ΔT always true except possibly ΔT=0, but at ΔT=0, 6*0=0, so 0 <=0, true.\n\nBut the inequality is 0 <= high, which is 0 <= 6ΔT, so for ΔT=0, 0<=0, true.\n\nAnd low <=0: -11+6ΔT <=0\n\nSo 0 in span when -11+6ΔT <=0 and 0 <= 6ΔT\n\n0 <= 6ΔT is always true for ΔT >=0, since 6ΔT >=0.\n\nAt ΔT=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nSo only condition is -11+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=11 => ΔT <= 11/6 ≈1.833\n\nSo for integer ΔT, ΔT=0,1\n\nAt ΔT=0: low = -11, high=0, [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nAt ΔT=1: low = -11+6= -5, high=6, [ -5,6], 0 in it.\n\nAt ΔT=2: low= -11+12=1, high=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe for ΔT=0 and ΔT=1.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, unsafe at which ΔT (relative to t_1=74)\n\nΔT=0 is turn 74.\n\ny=1: unsafe at ΔT=2\n\ny=2: unsafe at ΔT=2\n\ny=3: unsafe at ΔT=2\n\ny=4: unsafe at ΔT=2\n\ny=5: unsafe at ΔT=2\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: unsafe at ΔT=0 and ΔT=1\n\ny=6 and y=7 always safe.\n\ny=8 unsafe at ΔT=0 and 1.\n\nNow, I am at y=0 at ΔT=0 (turn 74).\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe path must avoid being on a freeway at unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at ΔT=0, y=8 is unsafe, but I am at y=0.\n\nNow, let's think about moving up.\n\nI start at y=0, ΔT=0.\n\nI can take actions: U, D, S.\n\nBut since I need to go to 9, and time is min, probably U or S, but S might be needed to wait.\n\nBut at y=0, safe, no cars.\n\nNow, if I go up to y=1 at next turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn index.\n\nSet t = ΔT, from 0.\n\nAt time t (absolute turn 74 + t), position y_t.\n\nAction a_t taken at time t, moves to y_{t+1}.\n\nAt time t, I am on y_t, and it must be safe for y_t at time t.\n\ny_t is the freeway I am on at turn t.\n\nFor t=0, y_0 = 0, safe.\n\nThen I take a_0, go to y_1.\n\ny_1 is position at turn t=1 (absolute 75).\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI need y_H = 9 for some H.\n\ny_H is position at turn H.\n\nSince I start at t=0, y_0=0.\n\nAfter H turns, I am at y_H, which should be 9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=0 to t=H-1, actions a_0 to a_{H-1}, y_0 to y_H.\n\ny_H = 9.\n\nMin H.\n\nNow, the unsafe times for freeways:\n\nFor y=1: unsafe at t=2 (since ΔT=2)\n\nSimilarly y=2 to y=5 unsafe at t=2\n\ny=6 and y=7 always safe\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=0 and t=1? t=0 and t=1 are ΔT=0 and 1.\n\nΔT is the time since t_1, so at absolute turn 74 + t, with t=ΔT.\n\nSo for freeway k, unsafe at t=2 for k=1,2,3,4,5\n\nUnsafe at t=0 and t=1 for k=8\n\ny=6 and 7 always safe.\n\nt=0: y=8 unsafe\n\nt=1: y=8 unsafe\n\nt=2: y=1,2,3,4,5 unsafe\n\nOther times, all safe except as above.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=9 at some t.\n\ny=9 has no cars, always safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to be at y=8 and go up, or something.\n\nNow, since y=6 and y=7 are always safe, I might go directly to them.\n\nBut I start at y=0.\n\nNow, at t=0, I am at y=0.\n\nI can choose to go to y=1 or stay or down, but down to y=0, same.\n\nProbably go up.\n\nIf I go up at t=0, a_0=U, then y_1 =1.\n\nAt t=1, I am on y=1.\n\nNow, at t=1, is y=1 safe? From above, y=1 is unsafe only at t=2, not at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, for y=1, ΔT=1, which is safe, as earlier.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 to 5 safe at t=1.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=1.\n\nBut I am at y=1 at t=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=1, I can take action.\n\nI need to avoid t=2 for y=1 to 5.\n\nSince y=6 and 7 always safe, I can go to them.\n\nBut at t=2, y=1 to 5 are unsafe, so I must not be on them at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, at t=0 and t=1, I must not be on y=8.\n\nNow, let's list possible paths.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of moves: from 0 to 9, if no obstacles, min 9 moves, but with waiting, might be more.\n\nBut I can go faster or slower.\n\nSince y=6 and 7 safe, I can go to y=6 or 7 quickly, then to 9.\n\nBut y=8 has restrictions.\n\nFirst, at t=0, I am at y=0.\n\nOption: stay or up.\n\nIf I stay, a_0=S, then y_1=0, still safe, but I waste time.\n\nNot good for min time.\n\nGo up, a_0=U, y_1=1.\n\nAt t=1, y=1.\n\nNow at t=1, I am on y=1, safe.\n\nI can go to y=2 or stay or down.\n\nIf I go to y=2, a_1=U, then y_2=2.\n\nBut at t=2, if I am on y=2, it is unsafe, because t=2, y=2 unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\nI must not be on y=1,2,3,4,5 at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, at t=1, I am on y=1, which is safe at t=1.\n\nBut if I go to y=2 at t=1, then at t=2 I am on y=2, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at t=1, a_1=S, then y_2=1, but at t=2, y=1 unsafe, so collision.\n\nIf I go down, a_1=D, y_2=0, then at t=2, I am on y=0, safe, but I went down, not progress.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo from t=1, I should not stay or go down on y=1, because if I stay, at t=2 on y=1 unsafe; if go down, back to 0.\n\nI need to go to a safe y at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=6 and y=7 are safe, y=0 and y=9 safe, but y=9 not reachable yet.\n\ny=1 to 5 unsafe, y=8 unsafe at t=0 and t=1, but at t=2, y=8 is safe? Let's see.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=0 and t=1, but at t=2, ΔT=2, which is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nFor y=8, unsafe at ΔT=0 and 1, so at t=2 (ΔT=2), safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 and 7 always safe.\n\nSo at t=2, safe y are: 0,6,7,8,9 but 9 not yet.\n\nNow, back to t=1, I am at y=1.\n\nI can go up to y=2, but then at t=2 on y=2 unsafe.\n\nI can go down to y=0, safe but waste.\n\nOr I can go up to y=2? No, same.\n\nAnother option: at t=1, from y=1, I can go to y=0, y=1, or y=2, but y=1 stay or y=2 both lead to at t=2 on y=1 or y=2, both unsafe.\n\nUnless I go to y=2 but then immediately move, but at t=2 I am on y=2.\n\nI need to be on a different y at t=2.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=1, if I go up to y=2, at t=2 I am on y=2.\n\nIf I stay, on y=1.\n\nIf I go down, on y=0.\n\nOnly choices.\n\nTo be on y=6 or 7 at t=2, I need to be closer.\n\nAt t=1, I am at y=1, I can only move to y=0,1,2.\n\nCannot reach y=6 in one move.\n\nSo from y=1 at t=1, I cannot avoid being on y=0,1, or 2 at t=2, but y=0 is safe, y=1 and 2 unsafe at t=2.\n\nSo the only safe option at t=2 is to be on y=0, by going down at t=1.\n\nBut that means I go back to start.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nPerhaps I should not go to y=1 at t=1.\n\nAt t=0, instead of going up, I stay or something.\n\nAt t=0, y_0=0.\n\nIf I stay, a_0=S, y_1=0, at t=1 on y=0.\n\nThen at t=1, I can go up to y=1, a_1=U, y_2=1.\n\nBut at t=2, if on y=1, unsafe.\n\nSame problem.\n\nIf at t=1, from y=0, I go directly to y=1, same as before.\n\nI need to be at a position where at t=2 I can be on safe y.\n\nBut from t=0, I start at y=0.\n\nIf I go up to y=1 at t=1, then at t=1 I am at y=1, and I have to move to avoid t=2 on low y.\n\nBut I can only move to adjacent y.\n\nAnother idea: go up quickly to y=6 or 7 before t=2.\n\nBut at t=0, I am at y=0.\n\nIf I go up each turn, at t=1, y=1; t=2, y=2, but at t=2 on y=2 unsafe.\n\nSo I must not be on y=2 at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, I can go up to y=1 at t=1, then at t=1, instead of going to y=2, I stay or down, but staying or down at t=1 on y=1 leads to unsafe at t=2 if stay, or to y=0 if down.\n\nBut at t=1, I can stay on y=1, but then at t=2 on y=1 unsafe.\n\nOr go down to y=0 at t=1, then at t=2 on y=0 safe.\n\nThen at t=2, I can start moving up from y=0.\n\nBut I wasted two turns: from t=0 to t=1, I went to y=1 and back to y=0, or stayed.\n\nNot good.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 at a safe time.\n\ny=8 is unsafe at t=0 and t=1, but safe from t=2 onwards.\n\ny=6 and 7 always safe.\n\ny=1 to 5 unsafe only at t=2.\n\nSo at t=2, I must not be on y=1-5.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, I need to go through y=8.\n\ny=8 is safe only from t=2 onwards.\n\nAt t=0 and t=1, y=8 unsafe.\n\nNow, let's find a sequence.\n\nSuppose I want to be at y=6 or 7 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, I can be on y=6 or 7, safe.\n\nThen from there go to y=8 and 9.\n\nBut at t=0, I am at y=0.\n\nTo be at y=6 at t=2, I need to move up 6 steps in 2 turns, impossible, since max move is +1 per turn, from y=0 to y=2 in two turns: at t=0, go to y=1; t=1, go to y=2; so at t=2, y=2.\n\nSimilarly, to y=6 at t=2, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at t=2 impossible.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=6 or 7 at t=2 from start.\n\nThe only safe y at t=2 are y=0,6,7,8,9.\n\ny=0: can be reached.\n\ny=6: cannot reach at t=2.\n\ny=7: cannot.\n\ny=8: can I reach y=8 at t=2?\n\nFrom y=0 at t=0, to y=8 at t=2.\n\nIn two moves: from t=0 to t=1, go to y=1; t=1 to t=2, go to y=2, so y=2 at t=2, not 8.\n\nTo reach y=8 at t=2, I need to move up 8 steps in 2 turns, impossible.\n\nMin turns to y=8 is 8, but at t=8.\n\nBut at t=2, I can only be at y<=2 if moving up.\n\nSo at t=2, the only possible safe y I can be at is y=0 or y=1 or y=2, but y=1 and 2 unsafe, so only y=0 is possible and safe.\n\nTherefore, at t=2, I must be at y=0 to avoid collision.\n\nThen, from t=2 onwards, I can move up freely, since after t=2, all freeways are safe except that y=8 was unsafe at t=0 and t=1, but from t=2 on safe.\n\ny=1 to 5 unsafe only at t=2, so after t=2, no issue.\n\ny=6 and 7 always safe.\n\ny=8 safe from t=2 on.\n\nSo from t=2, I can go directly to y=9.\n\nBut at t=2, I am at y=0.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9.\n\nMin turns: from y=0 to y=9, 9 moves, but I can do it in 9 turns from t=2.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nFirst, to be at y=0 at t=2.\n\nHow to achieve that.\n\nAt t=0, y_0=0.\n\nI can take a_0.\n\nIf I take S, y_1=0.\n\nThen at t=1, y_1=0.\n\nThen at t=1, I take a_1, if I take S, y_2=0, good.\n\nIf I take U, y_2=1, but at t=2 on y=1 unsafe.\n\nIf D, y_2= -1, but y must be in 0-9, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so I cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nIf at y=0, D is invalid? The action: if a_t=D, Δy_t = -1, so y_{t+1} = y_t -1, which must be >=0.\n\nIf y_t=0, D would make y_{t+1}=-1, invalid, so probably not allowed, or clipped, but the rule says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so I assume actions that would take y out of bound are not possible or ignored, but to be safe, we should not choose D at y=0 or U at y=9.\n\nSimilarly here, at y=0, a_t=D not possible, since y_{t+1} = -1 not in [0,9].\n\nSo at y=0, only S or U.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, only S or D.\n\nBack to t=0, y=0.\n\na_0: S or U.\n\nIf a_0=S, y_1=0.\n\nThen at t=1, y_1=0, a_1: S or U.\n\nIf a_1=S, y_2=0.\n\nThen at t=2, y_2=0, safe.\n\nIf a_1=U, y_2=1, but at t=2 on y=1 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf at t=0, a_0=U, y_1=1.\n\nThen at t=1, y_1=1, a_1: U, D, or S.\n\nIf a_1=U, y_2=2, at t=2 on y=2 unsafe.\n\nIf a_1=S, y_2=1, at t=2 on y=1 unsafe.\n\nIf a_1=D, y_2=0, at t=2 on y=0 safe.\n\nSo the only way to be safe at t=2 is to be at y=0 at t=2, achieved either by:\n\n- Stay at t=0 and stay at t=1: y_2=0\n\n- Or go up at t=0 to y=1, then down at t=1 to y=0: y_2=0\n\nIn both cases, at t=2, y=0.\n\nThe first way: stay twice, takes two turns to stay at 0.\n\nSecond way: go up then down, also at 0 at t=2, but I moved and came back.\n\nIn terms of time, both take to t=2 to be at y=0 with no progress.\n\nBut in the second way, I used actions, but position same.\n\nFor min time to reach 9, since I need to go to 9, it might be the same, but let's see after t=2.\n\nAfter t=2, all clear, I can go directly up to 9.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=2, I need to go to y=9.\n\nMin turns: 9 actions, to y_3=1, y_4=2, ..., y_11=9.\n\nAt turn t, y_t.\n\nAt t=2, y_2=0.\n\nThen a_2=U, y_3=1\n\na_3=U, y_4=2\n\n...\n\nup to a_10=U, y_11=9\n\nSo from t=2 to t=11, 9 turns, y=9 at t=11.\n\nt=11 absolute or relative.\n\nRelative t, from t=0.\n\nAt t=11, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions from t=0 to t=10, 11 actions? Let's index.\n\nt from 0: y_0, y_1, ..., y_H\n\nWith actions a_t for t=0 to H-1, y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, y_H=9.\n\nStart t=0, y_0=0.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn H, y_H=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, with being at y=0 at t=2.\n\nFirst, how to get to y=0 at t=2.\n\nOption 1: a_0=S, y_1=0; a_1=S, y_2=0\n\nThen from here, a_2=U, y_3=1; a_3=U, y_4=2; a_4=U, y_5=3; a_5=U, y_6=4; a_6=U, y_7=5; a_7=U, y_8=6; a_8=U, y_9=7; a_9=U, y_10=8; a_10=U, y_11=9\n\nSo y_11=9, H=11, from t=0 to t=10 actions, 11 turns including start? t from 0 to 10, 11 positions, but at turn t=0 to turn t=10, 11 turns, but the position is at each turn.\n\nAt turn t=0: y=0\n\nTurn t=1: y=0 (after a_0=S)\n\n...\n\nTurn t=10: y=9\n\nActions from t=0 to t=9? Let's clarify.\n\nThe turn is when action is taken.\n\nAt turn T (absolute or relative), position y_T, take action a_T, then next position y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nFor example, turn 0 (t_1=74): y_0=0\n\nAfter action a_0, at turn 1: y_1\n\n...\n\nAt turn H: y_H\n\nWe want y_H =9.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 0: y=0, take a_0=S, then turn 1: y=0\n\nTurn 1: y=0, take a_1=S, turn 2: y=0\n\nTurn 2: y=0, take a_2=U, turn 3: y=1\n\nTurn 3: y=1, take a_3=U, turn 4: y=2\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 10: y=9? Let's see:\n\nAfter a_2 at turn 2, y_3=1 at turn 3\n\nAfter a_3 at turn 3, y_4=2 at turn 4\n\n...\n\nAfter a_10 at turn 10, y_11=9 at turn 11\n\nBut we want y_H=9 at turn H.\n\nSo at turn 11, y=9.\n\nH=11.\n\nActions from turn 0 to turn 10, 11 actions? No.\n\nActions taken at turns: a_0 at turn 0, a_1 at turn 1, ..., a_{10} at turn 10.\n\nAfter a_{10}, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nSo min H such that at turn H, y_H=9.\n\nHere H=11.\n\nNumber of actions is 11, from t=0 to t=10.\n\nBut we can have fewer if we go faster.\n\nIn the second option to reach y=0 at t=2:\n\na_0=U at turn 0, y_1=1 at turn 1\n\nThen at turn 1, a_1=D, y_2=0 at turn 2\n\nThen same as before, from turn 2 y=0, go up to turn 11 y=9.\n\nStill H=11.\n\nBut in this case, at turn 1, I was at y=1, which was safe, since t=1, y=1 safe, no car at x=0.\n\nThen at turn 1, I went down to y=0.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut same time.\n\nBut is there a way to be higher at t=2?\n\nFor example, if I could be at y=3 at t=2, but y=3 unsafe at t=2, impossible.\n\nOr at y=6, cannot reach.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 and y=7 are always safe, I can go to them after t=2.\n\nBut at t=2, I am at y=0, then I need to go through y=1 to 5, which after t=2 are safe, since unsafe only at t=2.\n\nAfter t=2, all freeways safe at all times except y=8 at t=0,1 but past.\n\nSo from t=2, y=0, I can go directly to y=9 in 9 turns, as above.\n\nBut can I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I am at y=0 at t=2, but what if at t=1 I am at y=1, and I don't go down, but I can't, because if I stay or up, at t=2 on y=1 or 2 unsafe.\n\nUnless I go to y=0.\n\nBut y=0 is the only safe at t=2 for low y.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=8 at t=2, but impossible to reach.\n\nSo H=11 seems necessary with this path.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions.\n\nAnother thing: when I go up, I might be on a freeway when it is safe.\n\nFor example, at t=0, if I go up to y=1, I am on y=1 at t=1, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=1, if I could go to y=6, but I can only move to adjacent.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at y=0 for some turns, but that wastes time.\n\nOr, another thought: since y=8 is safe after t=1, at t=2 onwards.\n\nBut to reach y=8, I need to go through y=1 to 7.\n\nBut y=1 to 5 are only unsafe at t=2, so as long as I am not on them at t=2, I can be on them at other times.\n\nFor example, I can be on y=1 at t=1, which is safe, then at t=2, I must not be on y=1, so I need to move away.\n\nBut I can only move to y=0 or y=2, both of which are unsafe at t=2 except y=0.\n\ny=2 unsafe at t=2.\n\nSo only y=0.\n\nSimilarly, if I am at y=5 at t=1, I can go to y=4 or y=6, but at t=2, y=4 unsafe, y=6 safe.\n\nSo if I can be at y=5 at t=1, then at t=1 go to y=6, then at t=2 on y=6 safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nSimilarly, if I can be at y=5 at t=1.\n\nAt t=0, y=0.\n\nIf I go up, a_0=U, y_1=1 at t=1.\n\nThen from y=1, to reach y=5 at t=1? No, at t=1 I am at y=1, not y=5.\n\nTo be at y=5 at t=1, I need to be there from start.\n\nAt t=0, y=0, after one action, at t=1, y can be 0 or 1.\n\nCannot be higher.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=5 at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, only possible positions at t=1 are y=0 or 1.\n\nAt t=1, if y=0, I can go to y=1.\n\nIf y=1, I can go to y=0,1,2.\n\nBut to be safe at t=2, only y=0 or y=6,7,8 but y=6,7,8 cannot be reached at t=2.\n\nSo only y=0.\n\nTherefore, inevitably, at t=2, I must be at y=0.\n\nThen from there, min to y=9 is 9 more turns, so total from t=0, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nBut let's see if I can be at y=9 earlier.\n\nFor example, if I could reach y=9 before t=11, but from above, not possible.\n\nPerhaps by going to y=6 or 7 faster, but I have to go through the lower levels.\n\nAfter t=2, I can go up without stopping, so min time.\n\nBut at t=2, y=0, to y=9, 9 moves: turns 3 to 11.\n\nActions: from turn 2 to turn 10, 9 actions.\n\nTurn 2: at y=0, take U, to y=1 at turn 3\n\nTurn 3: at y=1, take U, to y=2 at turn 4\n\n...\n\nTurn 10: at y=8, take U, to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the initial part to reach y=0 at t=2.\n\nI have two options:\n\nOption A: at turn 0: S, then turn 1: S, so y=0 at turn 2.\n\nActions: turn 0: S, turn 1: S\n\nThen turn 2: U, turn 3: U, ..., turn 10: U\n\nTo turn 10, y_11=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 0 to turn 10, 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nOption B: at turn 0: U, to y=1 at turn 1\n\nThen turn 1: D, to y=0 at turn 2\n\nThen same as above.\n\nActions: turn 0: U, turn 1: D, then turn 2: U, ..., turn 10: U, to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nStill H=11.\n\nIn terms of number, same.\n\nBut in option B, I moved up and down, but same time.\n\nNow, is there a shorter way?\n\nSuppose at t=0, I stay, y=0.\n\nThen at t=1, I go up to y=1, but then at t=2, if I am on y=1, unsafe.\n\nUnless I go to y=2 at t=1, but then at t=2 on y=2 unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=8 directly.\n\nBut y=8 unsafe at t=0 and t=1, so I cannot be on y=8 at t=0 or t=1.\n\nBut at t=0, I am at y=0, not 8.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut to be on y=8, I need to arrive at some turn when safe.\n\nEarliest to be on y=8 is t=2, but cannot reach at t=2.\n\nMin turn to be on y=8: at turn 8, if I go up continuously from t=0.\n\nBut at t=2, I have to be at low y or 0.\n\nBut in the sequence, if I go up continuously from t=0:\n\nt=0: y=0, a_0=U, y_1=1\n\nt=1: y=1, a_1=U, y_2=2\n\nBut at t=2, y=2, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf I start later, but I need to reach early.\n\nSo the safe way is to be at y=0 at t=2, then go up.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nThe sequence should be actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and y at turn t_1 + H-1 is 9.\n\nIn the answer, it says: sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nIn my notation, relative t, at turn H, y=9.\n\nAbsolute turn: start at t_1=74.\n\nAt turn 74, y=0.\n\nAfter actions a_{74} to a_{74 + H-1}, at turn 74 + H, y=9? Let's see.\n\nThe player position at turn T is given.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, position at turn T+1 is y_{T+1}.\n\nWe start at turn t_1=74, y=0.\n\nWe take actions a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1 + K} such that at turn t_1 + K +1, y=9? I'm messing up.\n\nDefine:\n\nLet the actions be taken at turns: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + M\n\nAfter M+1 actions? Better to think of the turn when we reach y=9.\n\nAt turn t_1, y=0.\n\nAfter first action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, y_{t_1+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter last action at turn t_1 + H-1, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} =9\n\nSo we need to specify actions for turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and at turn t_1 + H, position is 9.\n\nNumber of actions: H.\n\nIn the sequence, H actions to reach after H steps.\n\nIn my earlier, with H=11 actions? Let's count.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nStart turn 74: y=0, take a_{74}, to y at turn 75.\n\nAfter a_{74}, turn 75 y= y1\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{74 + H-1}, turn 74 + H, y=9.\n\nSo actions from turn 74 to 74 + H-1.\n\nIn option A:\n\n- At turn 74: S, so turn 75: y=0\n\n- At turn 75: S, so turn 76: y=0\n\n- At turn 76: U, so turn 77: y=1\n\n- At turn 77: U, so turn 78: y=2\n\n- Turn 78: U, turn 79: y=3\n\n- Turn 79: U, turn 80: y=4\n\n- Turn 80: U, turn 81: y=5\n\n- Turn 81: U, turn 82: y=6\n\n- Turn 82: U, turn 83: y=7\n\n- Turn 83: U, turn 84: y=8\n\n- Turn 84: U, turn 85: y=9\n\nSo at turn 85, y=9.\n\nActions from turn 74 to 84, that's 11 actions: turns 74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84.\n\nH=11 actions.\n\nTurn 74 to 84 inclusive: 84-74+1=11 turns actions.\n\nAt turn 85, y=9.\n\nSimilarly, with option B:\n\nTurn 74: U, so turn 75: y=1\n\nTurn 75: D, so turn 76: y=0\n\nThen turn 76: U, turn 77: y=1\n\n...\n\nSame as above, up to turn 84: U, turn 85: y=9\n\nFrom turn 76 to 84 same as turn 76 to 84 in option A.\n\nIn option A, actions start from turn 74 S,75 S,76 U,...\n\nIn B, 74 U,75 D,76 U,...\n\nBut after turn 76, same.\n\nIn both, last action at turn 84, y=9 at 85.\n\nNow, is there a way with fewer actions?\n\nFor example, if I can be at higher y at t=2.\n\nBut not possible.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=6 or 7 directly, but I have to go through 1 to 5.\n\nSince after t=2, all safe, I can move up without delay.\n\nBut min 9 moves from y=0 to y=9.\n\nPlus the two turns to wait or move to be safe at t=2.\n\nIn option A, I stayed twice, but I could have moved and come back, same net.\n\nBut in terms of actions, still 11.\n\nAnother idea: at t=0, I go up to y=1.\n\nAt t=1, I am on y=1, safe.\n\nInstead of going down, I go up to y=2 at t=1, but then at t=2, I am on y=2, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nUnless for y=2 at t=2, but it is unsafe, so collision.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be the actions starting from turn t_1.\n\nAlso, in option B, I go up and then down, which might be acceptable, but same H.\n\nI can choose either.\n\nBut let's see if one is better.\n\nIn option B, at turn 75, I was at y=1, which is safe, and I went down, no issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 faster after.\n\nBut no.\n\nAnother thought: since y=6 and y=7 are safe, and I can be on them, but I still need to go through lower levels.\n\nFor example, after t=2, from y=0, I go up to y=6 quickly? But I have to move step by step.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=2, to y=6 at t=8, etc.\n\nSame as before.\n\nNo shortcut.\n\nSo H=11.\n\nNow for the sequence, I need to specify the actions.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 8, at t=0 and t=1 unsafe, but since I start at y=0, and later when I go to y=8, it is after t=2, safe.\n\nIn the sequence, when I go to y=8, at turn 84 in above, absolute turn 74 + 10? Turn 84 is t_1 + 10, since t_1=74, 74+10=84.\n\nΔT from t_1: at turn 84, ΔT=10.\n\ny=8 at turn 84, position.\n\nCars on y=8: at ΔT=10, for the cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6), span at ΔT: [37 + 6*10, 48 + 6*10] = [37+60,48+60]= [97,108], not near 0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6), span at ΔT: [-11 + 60, 0 + 60] = [49,60], not 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, other levels.\n\nIn the sequence, when I am on y=1 at turn 77, ΔT=3, for y=1, at ΔT=3, the car on y=1: span [48-36*3, 83-36*3]= [48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25], not 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly all.\n\nSo the sequence is fine.\n\nNow for output, I need minimal H, which is 11 actions.\n\nSequence: one possibility.\n\nFor example, with option A: all S for first two, then U all.\n\nBut at turn 74 and 75, S.\n\nThen U from 76 to 84.\n\nIn terms of actions:\n\nTurn 74: S\n\nTurn 75: S\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nThen at turn 85, y=9.\n\nWith option B:\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: D\n\nTurn 76: U\n\n...\n\nSame from 76.\n\nBut turn 75: D, which is down, but since at y=1, going down to 0, allowed.\n\nNow, in the answer, I think both are acceptable, but perhaps option A is simpler, just staying.\n\nBut H same.\n\nThe problem is to minimize H, so H=11.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose at t=0, I go up to y=1.\n\nAt t=1, I go up to y=2, but at t=2, on y=2 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt t=1, from y=1, I stay, but at t=2 on y=1 unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=3 at t=3, etc., but not faster.\n\nFor example, if I start at t=0 y=0, go U to y=1 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, go D to y=0 at t=2.\n\nThen from t=2 y=0, go U to y=1 at t=3, etc., but that is slower: y=9 at t=13 or something, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo min H=11.\n\nNow for the sequence, I need to output.\n\nAlso, in the car list, for k=3,4,5, there are multiple cars, but we handled.\n\nNow, the answer format.\n\nSo for example:\n\nTurn 74: S\n\nTurn 75: S\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nBut actions until turn 84, which is t_1 + 10, since 74 to 84 is 11 turns? t_1=74, actions from t_1 to t_1 + 10, that's 11 actions.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 84, so 74 + H -1 =84, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nYes.\n\nTo write the actions.\n\nSince y=6 and 7 are safe, I could go directly, but I have to go through 1-5 anyway.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at some point I can skip levels, but no, only adjacent moves.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nI think I should write the sequence.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me confirm the relative turns.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=74.\n\nActions for turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nWith H=11, so turns 74 to 84.\n\nActions: as above.\n\nIn option B, but with down, might look odd, but possible.\n\nI can use option A.\n\nTo save space, but not necessary.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up later, but not faster.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nIn the sequence, when I go from y=0 to y=1 at turn 76 to 77, etc., all safe after t=2.\n\nNow, for freeway 8, at the time I am on it, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think correct.\n\nThe minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nIt should be like:\n\nTurn 74: a_{74}\n\nTurn 75: a_{75}\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 84: a_{84}\n\nWith actions specified.\n\nIn my sequence, for example:\n\nTurn 74: S\n\nTurn 75: S\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nThen at turn 85, y=9.\n\nSince from y=0 to y=9, all U except the first two S.\n\nBut the first two S are to wait.\n\nIn the other sequence, U then D, then U.\n\nBut same length.\n\nI think S then S is fine.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,0), and I need to reach (0,9), which is done.\n\nAlso, in the car update, I think I covered all.\n\nFor k=8 at t=0 and t=1 unsafe, but I was not on it.\n\nIn my sequence, I am on y=8 at turn 84, ΔT=10, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 74\\) is 11, with the sequence of actions starting from turn 74 to turn 84.\n\nThe game dynamics and car positions require that the player avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at each turn. Analysis of the car positions shows:\n- Freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\) are unsafe only at \\(\\Delta T = 2\\) (absolute turn 76).\n- Freeway \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe at \\(\\Delta T = 0\\) and \\(\\Delta T = 1\\) (absolute turns 74 and 75).\n- Freeways \\(y = 6\\) and \\(y = 7\\) are always safe.\n- Positions \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) have no cars and are always safe.\n\nTo minimize \\(H\\), the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 76 (to avoid the unsafe condition on \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\)) and then proceed directly to \\(y = 9\\) without delay. The sequence is:\n- Stay at \\(y = 0\\) for turns 74 and 75 (actions S) to avoid being on unsafe freeways.\n- Move up continuously from turn 76 to turn 84 (actions U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 85.\n\nThis sequence ensures:\n- At turn 76 (\\(\\Delta T = 2\\)), the player is at \\(y = 0\\), avoiding collisions on \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\).\n- The path from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 9\\) after turn 76 is collision-free, as all freeways are safe for \\(\\Delta T > 2\\), and \\(y = 6\\) and \\(y = 7\\) are always safe.\n- Reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 85 minimizes \\(H\\), as any faster path would require being on an unsafe freeway at turn 76 or cannot be achieved in fewer actions.\n\nThe actions are:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 74: \\text{ } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 75: \\text{ } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 76: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 77: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 78: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 79: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 80: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 81: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 82: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 83: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 84: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 76, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0). The vertical position is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway k (which is the same as the y-coordinate) at that turn and the car's span (for that freeway) at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player). Note that the player is only on the freeway of the row they are in at that exact turn.\n\nImportant: When moving from row y at turn T to row y' at turn T+1, at turn T the player is only on row y, and at turn T+1 only on row y'. So if the player moves from row 1 to row 2 at turn T, then at turn T they are only on row 1 and at turn T+1 only on row 2.\n\nThe car update:\n- For a left-moving car: at turn T, the span is [h - s*(T - t_1), tau - s*(T - t_1)]\n- For a right-moving car: [tau + s*(T - t_1), h + s*(T - t_1)]\n\nNote: The initial state is given at turn t_1 (which is 76). So for any future turn T (>=76), the car's position is computed relative to turn 76.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn 76 (t_1) for H turns, ending when we first reach y=9.\n\nWe are starting at y=0 at turn 76. We must avoid the freeways 1 to 8 at the times we are on them.\n\nOur goal is to get to y=9. We can only change by at most 1 per turn, so we need at least 9 moves (if we go up every turn). But we might have to wait (use S or even D) to avoid cars.\n\nWe'll plan a path from y=0 to y=9, and for each freeway we must ensure that when we are on that freeway at turn T, the cars on that freeway do not have 0 in their span at turn T.\n\nLet's note the cars for each freeway at turn 76 (current state) and then we can compute their positions at any future turn.\n\nWe denote the current turn as T0 = 76.\n\nFreeway 1: one car (48, 83, left, 36)\n  This is left-moving. The head is 48 and tail is 83? But wait, for left-moving, the car moves left so the head should be the rightmost? \n  Actually, the problem states:\n    Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  But note: in the table, for freeway 1: (48,83,left,36). This means at turn 76, the car spans from 48 to 83? That would be a length of 35, but then moving left the head (which is 48) would be decreasing? \n  However, the problem says for left-moving: the update subtracts s*(T-t1) from both head and tail. So the entire car moves left.\n\n  But the span [48,83] is increasing? Actually, if the car is moving left, then the head (front) should be the leftmost? But the update rule subtracts, so the numbers get smaller. So if the car is at [48,83] at t1, then at a future time T, the car will be [48 - 36*(T-76), 83 - 36*(T-76)].\n\n  However, note that the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. This implies that at t1, the car covers from h to tau, and then both endpoints move left by s per turn.\n\n  But wait: the car is defined by head and tail. For a left-moving car, the head is the front (which is the leftmost point) and the tail is the rear? Then the span would be [head, tail] if the head is at a smaller x than the tail? But in the example, head=48 and tail=83: that would mean the car is from 48 to 83, so the head is at 48 (left) and tail at 83 (right). Then moving left, the head moves left and the tail moves left.\n\n  However, the problem states: \n      Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n      Right-moving: [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n  This notation for right-moving uses [tau, h] at t1? That seems reversed. Let me read again:\n\n      Right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\n  Why is it [tau, h]? The note says: \"For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at tau\". So for a right-moving car, the head is the front (rightmost) and the tail is the rear (leftmost). So the span is from the tail (left) to the head (right). So at t1, the car is [tau, h]. Then when it moves right, both endpoints increase.\n\n  Similarly, for left-moving: head is the front (leftmost) and tail is the rear (rightmost). So the car is [head, tail] = [h, tau] (from left to right). Then moving left, both decrease.\n\n  Therefore, in freeway 1: \n      car: head=48, tail=83, left, speed=36.\n      So at turn 76, the car spans [48, 83]. Then at turn T, it spans [48 - 36*(T-76), 83 - 36*(T-76)].\n\n  We are concerned with when the player is on freeway 1 (y=1) at turn T, and then we check if 0 is in [48-36*(T-76), 83-36*(T-76)].\n\n  Similarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? \n      (48,83,left,36) -> same as above.\n\nFreeways 3,4,5: each has three cars:\n  (48,37,right,12): for right-moving, so head is 48 (front, rightmost), tail is 37 (leftmost). So at t1, the car spans [37,48] (because the problem says for right-moving: [tau, h] -> [tau+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)]). So at T, [37+12*(T-76), 48+12*(T-76)].\n  (12,1,right,12): head=12, tail=1 -> [1,12] at t1, then [1+12*(T-76), 12+12*(T-76)].\n  (-24,-35,right,12): head=-24, tail=-35 -> at t1: [-35,-24], then [-35+12*(T-76), -24+12*(T-76)].\n\nFreeway 6 and 7: one car each: (48,37,right,6) -> [37,48] at t1, then [37+6*(T-76), 48+6*(T-76)].\n\nFreeway 8: two cars:\n  (48,37,right,6): same as above -> [37,48] at t1, then [37+6*(T-76), 48+6*(T-76)].\n  (0,-11,right,6): head=0, tail=-11 -> at t1: [-11,0], then [-11+6*(T-76), 0+6*(T-76)].\n\nWe start at turn 76 at (0,0). We cannot be on freeways 1-8 until we move to them. We start at y=0.\n\nWe need to go from y=0 to y=9. The minimal number of turns is at least 9 (if we go up every turn). But we might have to wait because of cars.\n\nWe are going to simulate the path. We want the minimal H. We can use BFS in the state space: (turn, y) but note the turn is relative and we are only concerned with the future. However, the cars move continuously so we have to check for each turn.\n\nWe can simulate from turn 76 onward. The state is (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at 76) and y is the current row.\n\nWe start at (76,0). We can take actions: U, D, S. But note: we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nThe goal: when we reach (t,9) for the first time, we stop.\n\nBut we must avoid being on a freeway k (1<=k<=8) at turn t if the cars on that freeway at turn t have 0 in their span.\n\nNote: at a state (t,y), if y is 0 or 9, then there are no cars (freeways are only 1-8). So we are safe.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". So when at y=0 or y=9, no freeway to collide? So safe.\n\nTherefore, we only need to worry when we are at y in {1,2,...,8} at a turn t.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H (number of turns) and the sequence.\n\nWe can do a BFS (breadth-first search) by the number of steps (turns). We start at step 0 (turn 76) at y=0.\n\nAt each state (t, y), we consider the next actions: U, D, S (if they keep y in [0,9]). Then we compute the next state (t+1, y') and check if that state is safe.\n\nBut note: when we are at state (t, y), we are at row y at turn t. We must check for collision at (t,y): if y is between 1 and 8, then we must check the cars on freeway y at turn t.\n\nHow to check: for each car on freeway y, we compute its span at turn t and see if 0 is in that span.\n\nWe are given the initial state at turn 76. So for a future turn t, we compute the car positions as:\n\n  For a left-moving car on freeway y: \n      span = [h - 36*(t-76), tau - 36*(t-76)]   (for freeways 1 and 2, speed 36)\n  For right-moving cars, the formula is as above.\n\nBut note: the cars on freeway 3,4,5 have multiple cars? Yes, we have to check all cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nWe'll precompute for each freeway and each turn (relative to 76) the set of x (if any) that are covered? Actually, we don't need the entire set, we just need to know if 0 is covered by any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute for each freeway and for a given turn t, whether there is a car that covers 0.\n\nWe are going to simulate step by step. Since we are looking for the minimal H, we can break when we first reach y=9.\n\nWhat is the maximum H we might need? The minimal H is 9. But if we have to wait, it might be more. The cars are moving and their positions are linear in time, so the pattern is periodic? Actually, the speeds are constants, but the periods might be long. However, note that we are going to simulate until we reach y=9, and we are starting at y=0. The worst-case might be bounded because the cars eventually move away? But we might have to wait for a car to pass.\n\nWe'll simulate turn by turn until we find a path.\n\nLet me define a function safe(t, y) that returns True if at turn t and row y, there is no collision.\n\nIf y is 0 or 9, safe = True.\n\nIf y is between 1 and 8, then we look at the freeway y and check all cars on that freeway at turn t.\n\nWe'll compute for each car on freeway y:\n\n  if the car is left-moving: \n      span_low = h - s*(t-76)\n      span_high = tau - s*(t-76)\n      then 0 is in [span_low, span_high] if span_low <= 0 <= span_high.\n\n  if the car is right-moving:\n      span_low = tau + s*(t-76)\n      span_high = h + s*(t-76)\n      then 0 in [span_low, span_high] if span_low <= 0 <= span_high.\n\nIf any car on freeway y at turn t has 0 in its span, then (t,y) is not safe.\n\nNow, we do BFS:\n\n  Let queue be a queue of (t, y, path_actions, path_length) \n  We start at (76, 0, [], 0)\n\n  We mark visited states? But note: we might come to the same (t,y) by different paths? However, if we are at (t,y) and we have a path of length L, and we want minimal H, then if we have been at (t,y) with a path of the same length or shorter, we can skip. But note: the same (t,y) might be reached by different sequences, but the future moves are independent of how we got there. So we can mark (t,y) as visited for a given t and y? However, we might have to wait at a row for multiple turns? So we might have the same y at a later t? And that might be necessary.\n\n  Actually, the state (t,y) is unique. So we can mark (t,y) as visited to avoid duplicates? But we might need to consider multiple paths that lead to the same state? However, if we are doing BFS by the number of turns, then the first time we reach (t,y) is the minimal steps. So we can use a visited set for (t,y).\n\n  We want minimal H (number of turns) to reach (t,9). So we do BFS by increasing t.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      Initialize:\n          queue: [(76, 0, [])]   # (turn, y, actions_so_far)\n          visited = set((76,0))\n\n      While queue:\n          pop state (t, y, actions)\n          if y == 9: then we have a solution with H = len(actions) and the actions.\n\n          Otherwise, for each action in ['U','D','S']:\n              y_next = y + delta\n                  U: delta=+1, D: delta=-1, S:0\n              Check bounds: y_next must be in [0,9]\n\n              Then the next state is (t+1, y_next). \n\n              But note: we are at (t,y) and we take action at turn t, so at turn t we are at row y. Then at turn t+1, we are at row y_next.\n\n              Now, we must check the state (t+1, y_next) for safety? \n\n              Actually, we have two points to check:\n\n                1. The current state (t,y): we must be safe at (t,y). But note: when we start, (76,0) is safe (y=0). Then we take an action to move to y_next at t+1.\n\n              However, during the move, at turn t we are at row y. So we must check that (t,y) is safe. But when we start at (76,0) we are safe. Then we consider the next state.\n\n              How we model: \n\n                  At turn 76: we are at (76,0) -> safe (since y=0). Then we choose an action for turn 76. Then at turn 77, we are at y_next.\n\n                  At turn 77: we must check the safety at (77, y_next). \n\n              So in the BFS, when we consider a move from (t,y) to (t+1, y_next), we have:\n\n                  - The state (t,y) must have been safe (because we were at y at turn t). But how do we ensure that? \n\n              Actually, when we start at (76,0) we know it's safe. Then when we generate the next state (77, y_next), we must check that (77, y_next) is safe? \n\n              But note: we are going to be at (77, y_next) at turn 77. So we must check safety at turn 77 and row y_next.\n\n              However, we also were at (76,0) at turn 76: that was safe because y=0. \n\n              So in the BFS, when we are at state (t,y) (which we have already reached and we know it's safe because we only add safe states), then we consider the next action that leads to (t+1, y_next). Then we check the safety of (t+1, y_next). If it is safe, then we add (t+1, y_next) to the queue.\n\n          So algorithm:\n\n            Start: (76,0) is safe -> we start.\n\n            For each action a in ['U','D','S']:\n\n                y_next = y + delta(a)\n\n                if y_next not in [0,9]: skip.\n\n                Then check if (t+1, y_next) is safe? \n                    Specifically, if y_next is 0 or 9 -> safe.\n                    else (1..8): check the freeway y_next at turn t+1.\n\n                If safe, then if (t+1, y_next) not visited, then add to queue with actions_so_far + [a], and mark visited.\n\n          We break when we reach y_next=9.\n\nBut note: we are starting at (76,0). Then the next state is at turn 77.\n\nWe must check for each state (t,y) that we visit: at the moment we are about to be at (t,y), we check safety at (t,y). But we are only generating states that are safe? \n\nActually, we are only adding states that are safe at the turn we are at.\n\nSo we design:\n\n  visited = set() # of (t,y)\n\n  queue = deque([(76, 0, [])])\n  visited.add((76,0))\n\n  while queue:\n      (t, y, actions) = queue.popleft()\n\n      if y == 9:\n          output actions and break\n\n      for a in ['U','S','D']:\n          if a == 'U': y_new = y+1\n          elif a=='D': y_new = y-1\n          else: y_new = y\n\n          if y_new < 0 or y_new > 9: \n              continue\n\n          # We are going to be at (t+1, y_new)\n          # Check safety at (t+1, y_new): \n          if y_new == 0 or y_new == 9:\n              safe_flag = True\n          else:\n              safe_flag = True\n              # Check freeway y_new at turn t+1\n              # Get the cars for freeway y_new\n              # Then for each car on freeway y_new, check if 0 is in the car's span at turn t+1.\n\n          How to get the cars? We have the initial state at turn 76.\n\n          We'll write a helper function: is_safe(t_check, freeway)\n\n          For freeway 1 and 2: \n            cars: one car: (48,83,left,36)\n            at turn t_check: \n                low1 = 48 - 36*(t_check-76)\n                high1 = 83 - 36*(t_check-76)\n                if low1 <= 0 <= high1: then unsafe.\n\n          For freeway 3,4,5: three cars each:\n            car1: (48,37,right,12) -> [37+12*(t_check-76), 48+12*(t_check-76)]\n            car2: (12,1,right,12) -> [1+12*(t_check-76), 12+12*(t_check-76)]\n            car3: (-24,-35,right,12) -> [-35+12*(t_check-76), -24+12*(t_check-76)]\n\n          For freeway 6,7: one car: (48,37,right,6) -> [37+6*(t_check-76), 48+6*(t_check-76)]\n\n          For freeway 8: two cars:\n            car1: (48,37,right,6) -> [37+6*(t_check-76), 48+6*(t_check-76)]\n            car2: (0,-11,right,6) -> [-11+6*(t_check-76), 0+6*(t_check-76)]\n\n          So for a given freeway k and turn t_check, we check:\n\n            if k==1 or k==2:\n                if 48 - 36*(t_check-76) <= 0 <= 83 - 36*(t_check-76):\n                    unsafe.\n\n            if k==3 or k==4 or k==5:\n                if (37+12*(t_check-76) <= 0 <= 48+12*(t_check-76)) or\n                   (1+12*(t_check-76) <= 0 <= 12+12*(t_check-76)) or\n                   (-35+12*(t_check-76) <= 0 <= -24+12*(t_check-76)):\n                    unsafe.\n\n            if k==6 or k==7:\n                if 37+6*(t_check-76) <= 0 <= 48+6*(t_check-76):\n                    unsafe.\n\n            if k==8:\n                if (37+6*(t_check-76) <= 0 <= 48+6*(t_check-76)) or\n                   (-11+6*(t_check-76) <= 0 <= 0+6*(t_check-76)):\n                    unsafe.\n\n          If any of these conditions is true, then safe_flag = False.\n\n          Then if safe_flag is True and (t+1, y_new) not in visited, we add (t+1, y_new, actions + [a]) to the queue and mark visited.\n\nWe do BFS so we find the minimal H.\n\nBut note: we are increasing t by one each step. We are starting at t=76, then 77,78,... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe must be cautious: the numbers can become negative and positive, and the cars move. We are only concerned with the turn when we are on the freeway.\n\nWe'll code the helper function.\n\nBut note: the expressions are linear in t. We can compute the condition for each car.\n\nLet me compute for freeway 1: \n  48 - 36*(t-76) <= 0 <= 83 - 36*(t-76)\n  => \n      48 - 36*(t-76) <= 0  => 36*(t-76) >= 48 => t-76 >= 48/36 = 4/3 => t-76 >= 2 (since integer, t>=78)\n      and 0 <= 83 - 36*(t-76) => 36*(t-76) <= 83 => t-76 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 => t-76 <= 2 -> t<=78.\n\n  So only at t=78: \n      t-76=2 -> low = 48-72 = -24, high=83-72=11 -> then 0 is in [-24,11] -> unsafe.\n\n  So at t=78, freeway1 is unsafe.\n\n  Similarly, for t<78: \n      t=76: [48,83] -> 0 not in [48,83] -> safe.\n      t=77: [48-36=12, 83-36=47] -> safe.\n      t=78: [-24,11] -> unsafe.\n      t=79: [48-36*3=48-108=-60, 83-108=-25] -> 0 not in [-60,-25] -> safe.\n\n  So freeway1 is unsafe only at t=78.\n\nFreeway2: same as freeway1: unsafe at t=78.\n\nFreeway3,4,5: three cars.\n\n  Car1: [37+12*(t-76), 48+12*(t-76)]\n        Condition: 37+12*(t-76) <= 0 <= 48+12*(t-76)\n        => \n            37+12*(t-76) <=0 -> 12*(t-76)<=-37 -> t-76 <= -37/12 ≈ -3.08 -> impossible? because t>=76 -> t-76>=0 -> always positive? \n        So 0 is always less than the lower bound? -> safe for car1.\n\n  Actually: at t=76: [37,48] -> 0 not in [37,48] -> safe.\n          t=77: [37+12=49, 48+12=60] -> safe.\n\n  Car2: [1+12*(t-76), 12+12*(t-76)]\n        Condition: 1+12*(t-76) <=0 <=12+12*(t-76)\n        => \n            The right part: 0<=12+12*(t-76) -> always true for t>=76.\n            The left part: 1+12*(t-76)<=0 -> 12*(t-76)<=-1 -> t-76<=-1/12 -> t<=75 -> but t>=76 -> never true.\n\n        So car2 never covers 0.\n\n  Car3: [-35+12*(t-76), -24+12*(t-76)]\n        Condition: -35+12*(t-76)<=0<=-24+12*(t-76)\n        => \n            Left: -35+12*(t-76)<=0 -> 12*(t-76)<=35 -> t-76<=35/12≈2.916 -> t<=78.916 -> t<=78 (since integer)\n            Right: 0<=-24+12*(t-76) -> 12*(t-76)>=24 -> t-76>=2 -> t>=78.\n\n        So at t=78: \n            low = -35+12*2 = -35+24 = -11\n            high = -24+24 = 0\n            Then 0 is in [-11,0]? -> yes, because high=0 -> [ -11, 0 ] includes 0.\n\n        So at t=78, car3 on freeway3,4,5 covers 0.\n\n        At t=79: \n            low = -35+12*3 = 1, high= -24+36=12 -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n  Therefore, freeway3,4,5 are unsafe at t=78.\n\nFreeway6,7: one car: [37+6*(t-76), 48+6*(t-76)]\n        Condition: 37+6*(t-76)<=0<=48+6*(t-76)\n        Left: 37+6*(t-76)<=0 -> 6*(t-76)<=-37 -> t-76<=-37/6≈-6.16 -> impossible -> safe.\n\nFreeway8: two cars.\n\n  Car1: same as freeway6: [37+6*(t-76),48+6*(t-76)] -> safe (as above).\n\n  Car2: [-11+6*(t-76), 0+6*(t-76)]\n        Condition: -11+6*(t-76)<=0<=6*(t-76)\n        The right part: 0<=6*(t-76) -> t>=76 -> always true.\n        The left part: -11+6*(t-76)<=0 -> 6*(t-76)<=11 -> t-76<=11/6≈1.83 -> t<=77.83 -> t<=77.\n\n        So at t=76: \n            low = -11, high=0 -> 0 in [-11,0]? yes, because high=0 -> unsafe at t=76.\n        at t=77:\n            low = -11+6= -5, high=0+6=6 -> 0 in [-5,6] -> unsafe.\n        at t=78:\n            low = -11+12=1, high=12 -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        Therefore, freeway8 is unsafe at t=76 and t=77, safe at t>=78.\n\nSummary of unsafe freeways at turns:\n\n  t=76: \n      freeway8: unsafe.\n\n  t=77:\n      freeway8: unsafe.\n\n  t=78:\n      freeway1: unsafe\n      freeway2: unsafe\n      freeway3: unsafe\n      freeway4: unsafe\n      freeway5: unsafe\n      freeway8: safe (from above: at t=78, freeway8 is safe)\n\n  t=79 and beyond: \n      freeway1: safe (at t=79: [-60,-25] -> safe)\n      freeway2: safe\n      freeway3,4,5: safe (only unsafe at t=78)\n      freeway6,7: always safe\n      freeway8: safe at t>=78.\n\nSo at t=76: unsafe on freeway8 -> so if we are at freeway8 at t=76, we crash. But we start at y=0 at t=76, then we are not on freeway8.\n\nAt t=77: freeway8 is unsafe -> so we must not be on freeway8 at t=77.\n\nAt t=78: freeways 1,2,3,4,5 are unsafe -> we must avoid being on freeways 1,2,3,4,5 at t=78.\n\nWe start at (76,0). We can choose:\n\n  Action at turn76: \n      U: go to y=1 at turn77 -> then at turn77 we are at (77,1). Check safety at (77,1): \n          freeway1 at t=77: we computed above for freeway1 at t=77: [12,47] -> 0 not in [12,47] -> safe. \n          So (77,1) is safe.\n      D: cannot, because y=0 -> D would go to -1 -> invalid.\n      S: stay at y=0 at turn77 -> then (77,0) is safe.\n\nWe want the minimal H. The minimal steps would be achieved by going up every turn. But we must avoid the unsafe turns.\n\nLet's try the direct path: \n\n  Turn76: U -> (77,1) -> safe (freeway1 at t77: safe)\n  Turn77: U -> (78,2) -> at t78, y=2 -> freeway2 at t78: unsafe! -> so we cannot be at y=2 at t78.\n\nSo we cannot go from (77,1) to (78,2) because at t78 we are on freeway2 which is unsafe.\n\nAlternative: at turn77, we don't go up? \n\n  From (77,1): \n      U: would go to (78,2) -> unsafe.\n      D: go to (78,0) -> safe (y=0).\n      S: stay at (78,1) -> freeway1 at t78: unsafe -> so unsafe.\n\nSo from (77,1), we can only go down to (78,0) at turn78.\n\nThen at (78,0): safe. Then we can go up again.\n\nBut we lost progress.\n\nAlternatively, at turn76: we might wait (S) at y=0 for one turn? Then at turn77 we are still at (77,0). Then at turn77 we can go up to (78,1) -> but freeway1 at t78 is unsafe -> so that would crash.\n\nSo if we stay at turn76, then at turn77 we are at (77,0). Then we can only move to (78,0) again? or (78,1) is unsafe, so we cannot go to 1 at t78? \n\nBut wait: at turn77 we are at (77,0). Then we can do:\n\n  U: (78,1) -> unsafe at t78 (freeway1 unsafe at t78) -> crash.\n  D: invalid.\n  S: (78,0) -> safe.\n\nSo we are stuck at 0 until t79? \n\nAt turn78: we are at (78,0). Then at turn79: we can go to (79,1) -> and then we are safe? Because freeway1 at t79: safe (we computed: at t79, freeway1: [-60,-25] -> safe).\n\nThen we can proceed upward.\n\nBut we have to avoid freeway2 at t79? Actually, freeway2 is safe at t79. Similarly, freeway3,4,5 are safe at t79.\n\nBut note: we must also avoid freeway8 at t76 and t77, but we are past that.\n\nSo plan:\n\n  Turn76: S -> stay at 0, then turn77: still at 0? \n      Actually: \n          Turn76: S -> at turn77: y=0 -> safe.\n      Then turn77: S -> at turn78: y=0 -> safe.\n      Then turn78: U -> at turn79: y=1 -> safe (freeway1 at t79: safe).\n      Then turn79: U -> at turn80: y=2 -> freeway2 at t80: safe? \n          freeway2 at t80: [48-36*(80-76)=48-36*4=48-144=-96, 83-144=-61] -> safe.\n      Then turn80: U -> at turn81: y=3 -> freeway3 at t81: safe? \n          freeway3 at t81: \n            car1: [37+12*(81-76)=37+60=97,48+60=108] -> safe.\n            car2: [1+60=61,12+60=72] -> safe.\n            car3: [-35+60=25,-24+60=36] -> safe.\n      Similarly, freeway4,5: same as 3? \n          Actually, freeways 3,4,5 have the same cars? So safe.\n      Then turn81: U -> at turn82: y=4 -> safe (same as above, freeway4 at t82: same computation? \n          Actually, we can compute: \n            freeway4: same as freeway3 at t82: \n              car1: [37+12*(82-76)=37+12*6=37+72=109, 48+72=120] -> safe.\n          ... safe.\n      Then turn82: U -> at turn83: y=5 -> freeway5: same, safe.\n      Then turn83: U -> at turn84: y=6 -> freeway6 at t84: \n          [37+6*(84-76)=37+6*8=37+48=85,48+48=96] -> safe.\n      Then turn84: U -> at turn85: y=7 -> freeway7: same as freeway6 -> safe.\n      Then turn85: U -> at turn86: y=8 -> freeway8 at t86: \n          car1: [37+6*(86-76)=37+60=97,48+60=108] -> safe.\n          car2: [-11+60=49,0+60=60] -> safe.\n      Then turn86: U -> at turn87: y=9 -> goal.\n\n  Total turns: from turn76 to turn87 -> 12 turns? But we started at turn76 and we did 12 actions? \n      We did actions at turns: 76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86 -> 11 actions? \n      How: \n          turn76: S -> at turn77: y=0\n          turn77: S -> at turn78: y=0\n          turn78: U -> at turn79: y=1\n          turn79: U -> at turn80: y=2\n          turn80: U -> at turn81: y=3\n          turn81: U -> at turn82: y=4\n          turn82: U -> at turn83: y=5\n          turn83: U -> at turn84: y=6\n          turn84: U -> at turn85: y=7\n          turn85: U -> at turn86: y=8\n          turn86: U -> at turn87: y=9\n\n      That's 11 actions? But we started at turn76, and after 11 actions we are at turn87. \n      So H = 11.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nWe started at y=0 at turn76. We waited two turns (76 and 77) and then started moving. \n\nAlternatively, we could have moved earlier? \n\nWhat if we go up at turn76 to y=1 (at turn77) -> safe. Then at turn77, we cannot go up (because then we'd be at y=2 at turn78 -> unsafe). But we can go down to y=0 at turn78? \n\n  turn76: U -> (77,1) -> safe.\n  turn77: D -> (78,0) -> safe.\n  Then same as before: starting from (78,0) we can go up at turn78 to (79,1) -> safe? \n      But at turn79: freeway1 is safe? -> yes.\n\n  Then we go up from turn79 to turn87: 9 moves? \n      So total actions: \n          turn76: U\n          turn77: D\n          turn78: U -> then from turn79 to turn87: we need 8 more moves? \n          Actually: \n            turn78: U -> (79,1)\n            turn79: U -> (80,2)\n            turn80: U -> (81,3)\n            turn81: U -> (82,4)\n            turn82: U -> (83,5)\n            turn83: U -> (84,6)\n            turn84: U -> (85,7)\n            turn85: U -> (86,8)\n            turn86: U -> (87,9)\n\n      So from turn78 to turn86: 9 actions? But we already did two actions at turn76 and 77? \n          Total: 2 (turns76,77) + 9 (turns78 to 86) = 11 actions? \n          But note: at turn78 we are doing the third action. Then the 11th action is at turn86, and we reach y=9 at turn87.\n\n      So same 11 turns.\n\nBut wait: we did:\n\n      turn76: U -> (77,1)\n      turn77: D -> (78,0)\n      turn78: U -> (79,1)\n      ... then 8 more U to get to (87,9)\n\n      That's 11 actions: at turns 76,77,78,...,86.\n\nIs there a way to avoid the two waits?\n\nAnother idea: what if we go up twice and then wait at y=2? But we cannot be at y=2 at turn78. So we must avoid y=2 at turn78.\n\nBut we can be at y=2 at turn79? \n\n  Freeway2 at turn79: [48-36*(79-76)=48-108=-60, 83-108=-25] -> safe.\n\nSo if we can get to y=2 at turn79, that would be safe.\n\nHow?\n\n  We start at turn76: \n      Option1: \n          turn76: U -> (77,1) [safe]\n          turn77: S -> (78,1) -> unsafe? because freeway1 at turn78 is unsafe -> not allowed.\n\n      Option2:\n          turn76: U -> (77,1)\n          turn77: U -> (78,2) -> unsafe (freeway2 at turn78 unsafe) -> not allowed.\n\n      Option3: \n          turn76: U -> (77,1)\n          turn77: D -> (78,0) [safe] -> then we are back to 0.\n\n      Option4: \n          turn76: S -> (77,0) [safe]\n          turn77: U -> (78,1) -> unsafe (freeway1 at turn78 unsafe)\n\n      Option5: \n          turn76: S -> (77,0)\n          turn77: S -> (78,0) [safe] -> then we start at turn78.\n\nBut we can try to go up at turn76 to y=1 (at turn77) and then at turn77 stay at y=1? -> but at turn78 we are at y=1 -> freeway1 at turn78 is unsafe.\n\nAlternatively, can we go to y=3 or more by turn78? \n\n  turn76: U -> (77,1)\n  turn77: U -> (78,2) -> unsafe -> crash.\n\n  We cannot jump.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeways 1 to 5 at turn78. The only safe rows at turn78 are 0,6,7,8,9? \n\n  But we are at y=1 at turn77. We cannot get to y=6 in one move? \n\n  So the only safe rows at turn78 are 0, and also freeways 6,7,8 are safe at turn78? \n\n      freeway6: safe? we computed always safe -> so y=6 is safe at turn78? \n          freeway6 at turn78: [37+6*(78-76)=37+12=49,48+12=60] -> safe.\n\n      freeway7: same -> safe.\n\n      freeway8: at turn78: we computed safe -> safe.\n\n  So we can be at y=6,7,8 at turn78? \n\nBut how to get to y=6 at turn78? \n\n  We start at y=0 at turn76. \n      We need to go up 6 steps in 2 moves? -> impossible: maximum we can go is 2 steps.\n\n  So we cannot be at y=6 at turn78.\n\nTherefore, the only safe row at turn78 is 0.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at turn78.\n\nTherefore, we have to do:\n\n  turn76: either U then D, or S then S.\n\nBoth lead to being at y=0 at turn78.\n\nThen we start moving up at turn78: \n\n  turn78: U -> (79,1) -> safe (freeway1 at t79: safe)\n  turn79: U -> (80,2) -> safe (freeway2 at t80: safe? we computed freeway2 at t80: [48-36*4=-96,83-144=-61] -> safe)\n  turn80: U -> (81,3) -> freeway3: safe? at t81: \n        car1: [37+12*(81-76)=37+60=97,108] -> safe\n        car2: [1+60=61,72] -> safe\n        car3: [-35+60=25,36] -> safe -> safe.\n  turn81: U -> (82,4) -> freeway4: same as freeway3 at t82: \n        car1: [37+12*6=109,120] -> safe\n        ... safe.\n  turn82: U -> (83,5) -> freeway5: same -> safe.\n  turn83: U -> (84,6) -> freeway6: [37+6*8=85,48+48=96] -> safe.\n  turn84: U -> (85,7) -> freeway7: same as freeway6 -> safe.\n  turn85: U -> (86,8) -> freeway8: [37+6*10=97,108] and [ -11+60=49,60] -> safe.\n  turn86: U -> (87,9) -> goal.\n\nSo 9 moves from turn78 to turn86? But we start moving at turn78: \n      turn78: action U -> then 78+1=79: we are at y=1\n      ...\n      turn86: action U -> then at turn87: we are at y=9.\n\n  That's 9 actions? \n\nBut we did two actions at turn76 and 77 to get to turn78 at y=0. \n\nTotal actions: 2 (for the first two turns) + 9 (for the next 9 turns) = 11.\n\nBut wait, we have to count the actions: \n    turn76: action (either S or U then D) -> 1 action\n    turn77: action (either S or D) -> 1 action\n    turn78: U -> 1\n    turn79: U -> 1\n    ... until turn86: U -> 1.\n\nTotal 11 actions.\n\nIs there a way to do in 10?\n\nWe need to get to y=9 in 10 actions. Then we would be at turn76+10-1 = turn85? \n\n  So we need to be at (85,9). \n\nBut we start at (76,0). We need to cover 9 units in 10 moves? That's possible if we do 9 U and 1 non-U? But we have to avoid the unsafe points.\n\nAlternatively, we might do 9 U and 1 S? Then we would be at y=9 at the 10th move? \n\n  But then we would be at turn76+10 = turn86? \n\n  Let me count: \n      turn76: action -> turn77: y1\n      ...\n      turn76+9: action -> turn85: y10\n      turn76+10: action -> turn86: y11\n\n  Actually, we start at turn76. We do H actions, and the last action is at turn76+H-1, and then at turn76+H we are at the new state. We require that at turn76+H-1 we do the last action and then at turn76+H we are at y=9.\n\n  So the state after H actions is at turn76+H, and we require y_{76+H}=9.\n\n  So we are at (76+H, 9). \n\n  We start at (76,0). So we need to go from 0 to 9, which takes at least 9 moves (if we do 9 U). Then H_min=9? \n\n  But wait: if we do 9 U's: \n      turn76: U -> turn77: y=1\n      turn77: U -> turn78: y=2 -> unsafe! (at turn78, freeway2 is unsafe)\n\n  So we cannot do 9 consecutive U's.\n\nWe must avoid being at y=2 at turn78. \n\nWhat if we do:\n\n  turn76: U -> (77,1) -> safe\n  turn77: S -> (78,1) -> unsafe? freeway1 at turn78: unsafe -> crash.\n\n  turn76: U -> (77,1)\n  turn77: D -> (78,0) -> safe\n  then we have to do 9 moves to go from 0 to 9: that would be 9 moves -> total 11 moves.\n\n  Or if we do:\n\n      turn76: S -> (77,0)\n      turn77: S -> (78,0)\n      then 9 moves: 0->9 -> 9 moves -> total 11.\n\nBut is there a way to get to y=9 by turn86 (so 10 moves from start) without crashing?\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn86. \n\nWe start at (76,0). We have 10 moves to get to (86,9). The net displacement is +9. The minimal moves to cover +9 is 9 moves (if we do 9 U's). So we have one extra move that can be a wait (S) or a down (D) that we must compensate.\n\nBut we have to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nWe know that at turn78 (which is the 3rd state: at turn76 -> state0, turn77->state1, turn78->state2) we must be at y=0 to be safe.\n\nBut if we are at y=0 at turn78, then we have two moves (turn76 and turn77) and we are still at 0. Then we have 8 moves from turn78 to turn86 to get to 9? \n\n  8 moves: maximum we can go is 8, but we need 9 -> impossible.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=0 at turn78 and then get to y=9 by turn86 (which is 8 moves later) because 8 moves only get us to y=8.\n\nSo we must be at a positive y at turn78. But the only safe y at turn78 are 0,6,7,8. \n\nWe cannot be at 6,7,8 at turn78 because we can't get there in two moves from 0.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=0 at turn78. Then we need 9 moves to get to 9: so we would finish at turn76+2+9 = turn87. \n\nBut we want to be at y=9 at turn86? That would be 10 moves: \n      Start at turn76: state0\n      After 10 moves: at turn76+10 = turn86.\n\nSo we need to be at (86,9). \n\nBut from (76,0) to (86,9): we have 10 moves. We must have at least 9 U's. So we have one extra move that must be a wait (S) or a down (D) that we then compensate with an extra U.\n\nBut we have to avoid the unsafe conditions.\n\nWe must avoid being at freeways 1-5 at turn78 (which is turn76+2). \n\nWe also must avoid freeway8 at turn76 and turn77.\n\nLet me denote the state at each turn:\n\n  t76: y0=0 (safe)\n  t77: y1 (must be 0 or 1? because we can move at most 1) \n        and we cannot be at freeway8 at t77 -> so if y1=8? we can't because we start at 0 -> we can only be at 0 or 1 at t77.\n        Also, if we are at y1=1 at t77: freeway1 at t77 is safe.\n\n  t78: y2 -> must be 0 (because if we are at y2=1, freeway1 unsafe; y2=2, freeway2 unsafe; y2=3, freeway3 unsafe; ... y2=5, freeway5 unsafe; y2=6,7,8: safe? but we can't get there from y0=0 in two moves: \n        from 0: \n          move1: to 1\n          move2: to 2 -> but then we are at y2=2 -> unsafe.\n\n        The only safe y2 is 0? \n\n        How to get to y2=0? \n          from y0=0: \n            move1: S -> y1=0\n            move2: S -> y2=0 -> safe.\n\n          or \n            move1: U -> y1=1\n            move2: D -> y2=0 -> safe.\n\n        So we have two options to be at y2=0.\n\n  Then from y2=0 at t78, we have 8 moves (from turn78 to turn86) to get to y=9? -> we need to cover 9 units in 8 moves? -> impossible.\n\nTherefore, we must take 11 moves.\n\nBut wait: what if we do 10 moves and we are at y=9 at turn86? \n\n  We start at (76,0). We have 10 moves: we do 10 actions at turns 76,77,...,85, and then at turn86 we are at the state.\n\n  The displacement: we must have 9 U's and one extra move that is not U? \n\n  The net displacement = (#U - #D) = 9.\n\n  So if we do 9 U and 1 D, then we have 9-1=8 -> not enough.\n\n  If we do 10 U and 0 D? then we go to 10, but we are bounded at 9 -> so we would be at 9 at the 9th move? then the 10th move we must do S or D? \n\n  Alternatively, we do 10 U's: \n        turn76: U -> y77=1\n        turn77: U -> y78=2 -> unsafe.\n\n  So we cannot do two U's at the beginning.\n\n  We must do a down or a stay at some point.\n\n  Suppose we do one D and 10 U's? Then net displacement = 10-1=9. So that would work in terms of displacement. \n\n  But we have to avoid the unsafe states.\n\n  We have 11 moves? Because 10 U's and 1 D is 11 moves? \n\n  Actually, the number of moves is 11: \n        moves: 10 U and 1 D -> 11 moves? \n\n  But we only have 10 moves? \n\n  Let me clarify: we start at turn76. We do H actions: at turn76, turn77, ... up to turn76+H-1. Then at turn76+H we are at the new state. \n\n  We require at turn76+H we are at y=9.\n\n  So if we do 10 moves (H=10), then we are at turn86.\n\n  We need to go from 0 to 9 in 10 moves. The net displacement must be 9. \n\n  So we must have: (#U - #D) = 9, and #U + #D + #S = 10.\n\n  Let u = #U, d = #D, s = #S.\n      u - d = 9\n      u + d + s = 10\n      => 2u + s = 19 -> so u must be at least 9 and at most 10.\n\n      If u=9: then 9 - d = 9 -> d=0, then s=1.\n      If u=10: then 10-d=9 -> d=1, then s=0.\n\n  So two possibilities: \n      Option1: 9 U, 0 D, 1 S -> net +9.\n      Option2: 10 U, 1 D, 0 S -> net +9.\n\n  Now, we must avoid the unsafe states.\n\n  Option1: 9U, 1S, 0D.\n\n      We start at 0. We have to do 9U and 1S. We must avoid being at y=2 at turn78.\n\n      The S can be done at any time. \n\n      If we do the S at turn76: \n          turn76: S -> (77,0)\n          turn77: U -> (78,1) -> unsafe (freeway1 at turn78 unsafe) -> crash.\n\n      If we do the S at turn77: \n          turn76: U -> (77,1) [safe]\n          turn77: S -> (78,1) -> unsafe.\n\n      If we do the S at turn78: \n          turn76: U -> (77,1) [safe]\n          turn77: U -> (78,2) -> unsafe.\n\n      So we crash at turn78.\n\n  Option2: 10U, 1D, 0S.\n\n      We must do 10U and 1D. The net is 9.\n\n      We have to use the D somewhere.\n\n      Possibilities:\n\n        Case A: D at turn76: invalid (y=0 -> D would go to -1) -> not allowed.\n\n        Case B: D at turn77: \n            turn76: U -> (77,1) [safe]\n            turn77: D -> (78,0) [safe] -> then we are at 0 at turn78.\n            Then we need to go from 0 to 9 in 8 moves: we need 9U and we have 8 moves -> impossible.\n\n        Case C: D at turn78: \n            turn76: U -> (77,1) [safe]\n            turn77: U -> (78,2) -> unsafe.\n\n        Case D: D at a later turn.\n\n          Suppose we go up twice: \n            turn76: U -> (77,1)\n            turn77: U -> (78,2) -> unsafe -> crash.\n\n      So we cannot avoid the crash at turn78.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 by turn86 (10 moves). \n\nSo minimal moves is 11.\n\nNow, we have two sequences that work:\n\n  Sequence A (wait twice at 0):\n      turn76: S\n      turn77: S\n      turn78: U\n      turn79: U\n      turn80: U\n      turn81: U\n      turn82: U\n      turn83: U\n      turn84: U\n      turn85: U\n      turn86: U\n\n      Then at turn87: we are at y=9.\n\n  Sequence B (up then down then up):\n      turn76: U\n      turn77: D\n      turn78: U\n      turn79: U\n      turn80: U\n      turn81: U\n      turn82: U\n      turn83: U\n      turn84: U\n      turn85: U\n      turn86: U\n\n      Then at turn87: y=9.\n\nBoth are 11 moves.\n\nWe can output either. But note: we must output the actions for turns starting at turn76.\n\nLet me write Sequence B:\n\n  Turn 76: U\n  Turn 77: D\n  Turn 78: U\n  Turn 79: U\n  Turn 80: U\n  Turn 81: U\n  Turn 82: U\n  Turn 83: U\n  Turn 84: U\n  Turn 85: U\n  Turn 86: U\n\nBut wait: after 11 moves, the last action is at turn86, and then at turn87 we are at y=9.\n\nSo we do 11 actions.\n\nSimilarly, Sequence A:\n\n  Turn76: S\n  Turn77: S\n  Turn78: U\n  Turn79: U\n  Turn80: U\n  Turn81: U\n  Turn82: U\n  Turn83: U\n  Turn84: U\n  Turn85: U\n  Turn86: U\n\nWe'll choose one. Let's choose Sequence B.\n\nBut note: we must ensure that in Sequence B, we are safe at every state.\n\n  State at turn76: (76,0) -> safe.\n  Action at turn76: U -> then at turn77: (77,1) -> check freeway1 at turn77: \n        freeway1 at t77: [48-36=12, 83-36=47] -> 0 not in [12,47] -> safe.\n  Action at turn77: D -> then at turn78: (78,0) -> safe.\n  Action at turn78: U -> then at turn79: (79,1) -> freeway1 at t79: [48-36*3=-60,83-108=-25] -> safe.\n  Then we go up consecutively: \n        turn79: U -> (80,2): freeway2 at t80: [48-36*4=-96,83-144=-61] -> safe.\n        turn80: U -> (81,3): freeway3 at t81: [37+12*5=97,48+60=108] (wait, t81-76=5) -> 37+60=97,48+60=108 -> safe.\n        turn81: U -> (82,4): freeway4 at t82: [37+12*6=109,48+72=120] -> safe.\n        turn82: U -> (83,5): freeway5 at t83: [37+12*7=37+84=121,48+84=132] -> safe.\n        turn83: U -> (84,6): freeway6 at t84: [37+6*8=37+48=85,48+48=96] -> safe.\n        turn84: U -> (85,7): freeway7 at t85: [37+6*9=37+54=91,48+54=102] -> safe.\n        turn85: U -> (86,8): freeway8 at t86: \n                car1: [37+6*10=37+60=97,48+60=108] -> safe.\n                car2: [-11+6*10=49,0+60=60] -> safe.\n        turn86: U -> (87,9): goal.\n\nSo safe.\n\nWe can output Sequence B.\n\nBut note: the problem asks for the minimal number of turns H. H is the number of actions? In our case, we did 11 actions. The last action is at turn86, and at turn87 we are at y=9. So the total turns from start to finish is 11 turns? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nH is the number of actions. We did 11 actions.\n\nBut note: we start at turn76. The actions are taken at turns: 76,77,...,86 -> 11 actions. Then at turn87, we are at (0,9) without having taken an action at turn87. So H=11.\n\nIs there a shorter path? We argued 10 is impossible.\n\nTherefore, we output the sequence for Sequence B.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have two sequences with H=11. So either is acceptable.\n\nWe'll output:\n\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: D\nTurn 78: U\nTurn 79: U\nTurn 80: U\nTurn 81: U\nTurn 82: U\nTurn 83: U\nTurn 84: U\nTurn 85: U\nTurn 86: U\n\nBut wait: the answer format says:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSo t_1 = 76.\n\nTherefore:\n\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: D\nTurn 78: U\nTurn 79: U\nTurn 80: U\nTurn 81: U\nTurn 82: U\nTurn 83: U\nTurn 84: U\nTurn 85: U\nTurn 86: U\n\nThis is 11 actions.\n\nWe must ensure that we do not output beyond when we reach y=9. The last action is at turn86, which moves us to y=9 at turn87. So we stop at turn86.\n\nWe can also do Sequence A (which is equally good). \n\nBut let me check if we can do 11 moves without the initial down? \n\n  Sequence A: \n      Turn76: S\n      Turn77: S\n      Turn78: U\n      ... then 9 U's? That would be 11 moves: \n          turns78 to 86: 9 moves? \n          But we have 11 moves: \n              turn76: S\n              turn77: S\n              turn78: U\n              turn79: U\n              turn80: U\n              turn81: U\n              turn82: U\n              turn83: U\n              turn84: U\n              turn85: U\n              turn86: U\n\n          That's 11 moves. And at turn87: y=9.\n\n  And safety: \n      turn76: (76,0) -> safe.\n      turn77: (77,0) -> safe.\n      turn78: (78,0) -> safe.\n      turn79: (79,1) -> safe (as above)\n      ... same as before.\n\n  So also valid.\n\nBoth are valid. We choose one.\n\nI'll choose Sequence B because it moves up earlier.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: D\nTurn 78: U\nTurn 79: U\nTurn 80: U\nTurn 81: U\nTurn 82: U\nTurn 83: U\nTurn 84: U\nTurn 85: U\nTurn 86: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=11.\n\nHowever, we must ensure we don't have a shorter path? We already argued 10 is impossible.\n\nTherefore, we output the above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 76 is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by moving up at turn 76, down at turn 77 to avoid unsafe conditions at turn 78, and then moving up consecutively from turn 78 to turn 86.\n\n- At turn 76, moving up to \\(y = 1\\) is safe because freeway 1 at turn 77 has no car covering \\(x = 0\\).\n- At turn 77, moving down to \\(y = 0\\) avoids being on any freeway at turn 78, where freeways 1 to 5 are unsafe.\n- From turn 78 to turn 86, moving up each turn reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 87.

The player moves vertically with actions U (up), D (down), or S (stay), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I have its position at turn t_1=78, with head, tail, direction, and speed. The direction tells us if it's left or right-moving, and from that, I can find where it is at any future turn T.\n\nCollision happens if at turn T, when the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The note says that if you move to a different y at turn T, you're not on that new y until the next turn, so you only check the car on your current y at turn T.\n\nI start at y=0 at turn 78. I need to reach y=9. Since y=9 is not a freeway, no cars there, so I just need to get to y=9 safely.\n\nThe freeways are from y=1 to y=8, each with cars.\n\nFirst, I need to model where the cars are at any turn after 78.\n\nLet me denote the turn difference. Let τ = T - t_1 = T - 78. So at time T, τ = T - 78.\n\nFor a car, at τ=0, we have the span given.\n\nFor left-moving cars: direction left, so as τ increases, the car moves left, so head decreases.\n\nThe update: for left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s τ, τ - s τ] where τ = T - t_1.\n\nHead at T: h - s τ\n\nTail at T: τ - s τ? That can't be right.\n\nLook: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the notation, it says \"tail is at τ\", but τ is used for time difference, confusing.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"head h, tail τ\", so τ is tail position at t_1.\n\nBut in the update, τ is used for time, but in the text, it's T - t_1.\n\nI think in the car state, it's (head, tail, direction, speed), so let's use different variables.\n\nFor a car, at turn t_1:\n\nLet head position at t_1 be h\n\nTail position at t_1 be t (I'll use t for tail, to avoid tau)\n\nDirection d: left or right\n\nSpeed s\n\nThen at turn T = t_1 + τ, with τ ≥ 0,\n\nIf left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s τ, t - s τ]  ? But h and t are positions at τ=0.\n\nSince it moves left, both head and tail decrease by s per turn? No.\n\nThe span shifts left by s per turn.\n\nSo for left-moving car, position at T: head position = h - s (T - t_1)\n\nTail position = t - s (T - t_1)\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: head position = h + s (T - t_1)\n\nTail position = t + s (T - t_1)\n\nIn the description, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" and then [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)], so in that case, for right-moving, tail is left, head is right, I think.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for direction, it might define head and tail.\n\nFor left-moving, it says \"head at h, tail at τ\", and since left-moving, head is on the right, tail on left, so as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\", so τ is tail, h is head, and for right-moving, tail on left, head on right, so both increase when moving right.\n\nIn the car state table, for example, freeway 1: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nSo head = -24, tail = 11? That can't be, because for left-moving, if head is -24 and tail is 11, -24 < 11, but if moving left, head should be greater than tail, I think.\n\nI think there's inconsistency in the notation.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor freeway 1: cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nGiven: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nBut for left-moving, if head is at -24 and tail at 11, and it's moving left, that means tail at 11, head at -24? But 11 > -24, so tail is at higher x, which means the car is from x=11 to x=-24? That doesn't make sense because x positions, lower is left, higher is right, I assume.\n\nThe grid, x=0 is the position, cars on freeways, x can be negative or positive.\n\nBut for a car, the span should be such that for left-moving, the head is on the right, so higher x, tail on left, lower x.\n\nHere, head = -24, tail = 11, but -24 < 11, so head at x=-24, tail at x=11, so if head is at -24 and tail at 11, that means the car extends from x=-24 to x=11, so if moving left, the head should be at the right end, so head at 11, tail at -24? I'm confused.\n\nLet's look at the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd in the car state, it's given as (h, τ, d, s), so for freeway 1: ( -24, 11, left, 36)\n\nSo at t_1, span is [h, τ] = [-24, 11]\n\nBut -24 to 11, with h=-24, τ=11, so since -24 < 11, the head is at left? That doesn't match the direction.\n\nPerhaps the span is given as [min, max] or something.\n\nLet's see the right-moving example.\n\nFor freeway 3: ( -48, -59, right, 12), etc.\n\nFor right-moving, \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" and then [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 3, first car: ( -48, -59, right, 12)\n\nSo for right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the notation, it says \"head h, tail τ\", but for right-moving, \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\", so τ is tail, h is head, and for right-moving, tail is on left, head on right, so [tail, head] with tail < head.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\", and if it's moving left, h should be the right end, so h > τ, and [h, τ] with h > τ, so the span is from high to low? But in interval notation, it's usually low to high.\n\nI think there's a confusion in the notation.\n\nLet's clarify from the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" and then [h - sΔ, τ - sΔ] where Δ = T-t_1.\n\nSince it's moving left, both decrease, so the span shifts left.\n\nBut for the span to make sense, if h and τ are positions, and for left-moving, the head (front) should be at higher x, so if h is head, it should be larger than tail τ, so [h, τ] with h > τ means the car is from x=τ to x=h, with τ < h.\n\nThen when moving left, both decrease, so at T, from τ - sΔ to h - sΔ, so the lower end is τ - sΔ, higher end h - sΔ.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" with τ tail, h head, and for right-moving, tail on left, head on right, so τ < h, span from τ to h.\n\nThen at T, [τ + sΔ, h + sΔ].\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (head h, tail τ, d, s) = (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nBut for left-moving, if head h = -24, tail τ = 11, then -24 < 11, so h < τ, which contradicts the assumption that for left-moving, head is on right, so h > τ.\n\nHere h = -24, τ = 11, h < τ, so this is inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps the \"head\" and \"tail\" are misnomed, or it's the position values.\n\nAnother possibility: the span is given as (position1, position2), and the direction tells which is head.\n\nBut in the update rule, for left-moving, it's specified as [h, τ] with h and τ, and both decrease.\n\nFor freeway 1: h = -24, τ = 11, both given, and d=left.\n\nAt t_1, span is [ -24, 11], so from x=-24 to x=11.\n\nSince it's left-moving, the head is at the left end? But usually head is the front, so for left-moving, front is left, so head at min x.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, head at max x.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1, left-moving, head at -24, tail at 11, so the car is from -24 to 11, and head at -24, so when moving left, the head moves to more negative, tail to less positive.\n\nAt T, span [ -24 - sτ, 11 - sτ] with τ=T-t_1.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, like freeway 3, first car: ( -48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFor right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? τ is tail, h is head, but in the tuple it's (head, tail), so for this car, head = -48, tail = -59, so tail at -59, head at -48, so span from -59 to -48, and since right-moving, head at -48, tail at -59, both increase when moving right.\n\nAt T, for right-moving, [ tail + sΔ, head + sΔ] = [ -59 + sΔ, -48 + sΔ].\n\nIn general, for any car, at time T, the span can be calculated.\n\nCollision if at turn T, the player is on freeway y, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nThe player position at turn T is y_T, and we check if for freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at T.\n\nAlso, when the player moves, at turn T, if they move to a different y, they are not on the new y until turn T+1, so at turn T, they are on y_T, and we check cars on y_T at T.\n\nThen at turn T, they choose action, which determines y_{T+1}, but at turn T, they are on y_T.\n\nStart at turn 78, y=0.\n\nAt turn 78, player is at y=0, which is not a freeway, so no cars, so safe.\n\nThen at each turn, we choose action to go to next y.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 have no cars, only freeways 1-8 have cars.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since we need to go from y=0 to y=9, the shortest path would be to go up all the time, but we might hit cars, so we need to avoid them by waiting or moving down sometimes, but since we want minimal turns, probably we go up as much as possible, but avoid the cars.\n\nBut going down might be necessary if there's a car blocking the way.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway at t_1=78.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head = -24, tail = 11, direction left, speed 36. So at τ=0, span [ -24, 11]? But for left-moving, the span is [h, τ] with both decreasing, but in terms of values, at t_1, positions from min to max: from -24 to 11, since -24 < 11.\n\nLet me define the left end and right end for clarity.\n\nFor a car, at time t, let L(t) be the leftmost x, R(t) be the rightmost x.\n\nThen for left-moving car, L(t) = L(t_1) - s (t - t_1)\n\nR(t) = R(t_1) - s (t - t_1)\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, L(t) = L(t_1) + s (t - t_1)\n\nR(t) = R(t_1) + s (t - t_1)\n\nAt t_1, for each car, from the given (head, tail, d, s), we can find L(t_1) and R(t_1).\n\nFor left-moving, if d=left, then head is at min x or max x?\n\nFrom the update, for left-moving, both positions decrease, so the lower value is at left, higher at right.\n\nIn freeway 1, head = -24, tail = 11, d=left, so at t_1, left end is min(-24,11) = -24, right end is max(-24,11) =11, so L(t_1) = -24, R(t_1) =11.\n\nThen for left-moving, L(t) = L(t_1) - s (t - t_1) = -24 - 36 τ\n\nR(t) = R(t_1) - s (t - t_1) = 11 - 36 τ\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like freeway 3, first car: head = -48, tail = -59, d=right, so at t_1, left end is min(-48,-59) = -59, right end is max(-48,-59) = -48, so L(t_1) = -59, R(t_1) = -48.\n\nThen for right-moving, L(t) = L(t_1) + s (t - t_1) = -59 + 12 τ\n\nR(t) = R(t_1) + s (t - t_1) = -48 + 12 τ\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nAlso, collision if at turn t, player on freeway y, and for that freeway, there is a car with L(t) <= 0 <= R(t), i.e., 0 in [L(t), R(t)].\n\nNow, let's list all freeways and their cars at t_1=78.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, L= -24, R=11, d=left, s=36\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? \"(-24, 11, left, 36)\" same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: \n\nFirst: (-48, -59, right, 12) so L= -59, R= -48, d=right, s=12\n\nSecond: (36, 25, right, 12) head=36, tail=25, d=right, so min=25, max=36, L=25, R=36? But tail and head, for right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so L=25, R=36, d=right, s=12\n\nThird: (0, -11, right, 12) head=0, tail=-11, d=right, so L= min(0,-11)= -11, R= max(0,-11)=0? So L= -11, R=0, d=right, s=12\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? \"(-48, -59, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)\" identical.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5 same.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (60, 49, right, 6) head=60, tail=49, d=right, so L= min(60,49)=49, R= max(60,49)=60, so L=49, R=60, d=right, s=6\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6: \"(60, 49, right, 6)\"\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (60, 49, right, 6) and (12, 1, right, 6)\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,6) same as above, L=49, R=60\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6) head=12, tail=1, d=right, so L=1, R=12, s=6\n\nNow, for each freeway, we need to find when 0 is covered by a car, i.e., when L(t) <= 0 <= R(t) for some car on that freeway.\n\nSince the cars move, this changes with time.\n\nWe need to find for each freeway, the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway, at turn t, is there a car with 0 in its span.\n\nThen, for the player to be on that freeway at time t, we need that at time t, for freeway y, it is not occupied, meaning no car covers x=0.\n\nThen we can plan the path.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the time intervals when x=0 is occupied, so the freeway is blocked at that time.\n\nIf not occupied, it is safe to be on.\n\nAt time t, if no car has L(t) <=0<= R(t), then freeway is safe at t.\n\nOtherwise, occupied.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, left-moving.\n\nL(t) = -24 - 36 τ\n\nR(t) = 11 - 36 τ\n\nWhere τ = t - 78\n\n0 in [L(t), R(t)] iff L(t) <= 0 <= R(t)\n\nSo -24 -36τ <= 0 and 0 <= 11 -36τ\n\nFirst inequality: -24 -36τ <= 0 => -36τ <= 24 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality, 36τ >= -24, but τ >=0, always true since 36τ >=0 > -24? -24 -36τ <=0, so -36τ <=24, divide by -36, reverse, τ >= -24/36 = -2/3, but τ >=0, so always true.\n\n-24 -36τ <= 0 => -36τ <= 24 => τ >= 24/(-36) = -24/36 = -2/3, but since τ >=0, this is always true.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 11 -36τ => 36τ <= 11 => τ <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nSo 0 <= R(t) when τ <= 11/36\n\nAnd L(t) <=0 always for τ>=0.\n\nSo 0 in span when τ <= 11/36\n\nSince τ integer (turns), τ =0,1,2,... so τ <= floor(11/36) but 11/36<1, so τ=0 only.\n\nτ <= 11/36 ≈0.305, so for τ=0, which is t=78.\n\nAt t=78, τ=0, L= -24, R=11, 0 is between -24 and 11, yes.\n\nFor τ=1, t=79, L= -24-36= -60, R=11-36= -25, so [-60,-25], 0 not in, since 0 > -25? R= -25, L= -60, so from -60 to -25, 0 is greater than -25, so not in [L,R].\n\nSimilarly for later τ.\n\nSo for freeway 1, occupied only at τ=0, t=78.\n\nFor other times, safe.\n\nBut player at t=78 is at y=0, not on freeway 1.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, so also occupied only at t=78.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12) but we have L and R.\n\nCar1: L(t) = -59 + 12τ, R(t) = -48 +12τ\n\n0 in [L(t),R(t)] iff -59+12τ <=0 and 0<= -48+12τ\n\nFirst: -59+12τ <=0 => 12τ <=59 => τ <= 59/12 ≈4.916\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +12τ => 48 <=12τ => τ >= 48/12 =4\n\nSo for τ=4,5? τ integer, τ>=4 and τ<=4.916, so τ=4.\n\nτ>=4 and τ<=59/12=4.916, so τ=4 only? τ=4 and τ=5? τ=4: 12*4=48, R= -48+48=0, L= -59+48= -11, so [-11,0], 0 is included, so yes.\n\nτ=5: L= -59+60=1, R= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nτ=3: L= -59+36= -23, R= -48+36= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at τ=4, t=78+4=82.\n\nCar2: (36,25,right,12) L=25, R=36 at t1, d=right, s=12\n\nL(t) =25 +12τ, R(t)=36+12τ\n\n0 in [L,R]? L(t)=25+12τ >=25 >0 for τ>=0, so L(t) >0, so 0 < L(t) <= R(t), so 0 not in [L,R] since L(t) >0.\n\nSimilarly, always safe for this car.\n\nCar3: (0,-11,right,12) L= -11, R=0 at t1, d=right, s=12\n\nL(t)= -11 +12τ, R(t)=0 +12τ\n\n0 in [L,R] iff L(t) <=0 and 0<= R(t)\n\n0<= R(t) always since R(t)=12τ >=0\n\nL(t) <=0 iff -11+12τ <=0 => 12τ <=11 => τ <=11/12≈0.916\n\nSo for τ=0 only, since τ integer.\n\nτ=0: L=-11, R=0, so [ -11,0], 0 included.\n\nτ=1: L= -11+12=1, R=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at τ=0, t=78.\n\nFor freeway 3, occupied when:\n\n- Car1 at t=82 (τ=4)\n\n- Car2 never\n\n- Car3 at t=78 (τ=0)\n\nSo at t=78, car3 covers x=0.\n\nAt t=82, car1 covers x=0.\n\nOther times, freeway 3 is safe.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3, so same times: occupied at t=78 and t=82.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5 same.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car (60,49,right,6) L=49, R=60 at t1, d=right, s=6\n\nL(t)=49+6τ, R(t)=60+6τ\n\nBoth increasing, L(t) >=49>0, so always 0 < L(t) <= R(t), so never covers 0. Always safe.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6, always safe.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,6) same as above, L=49, R=60, moving right, never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6) head=12, tail=1, d=right, so L=1, R=12 at t1.\n\nL(t)=1 +6τ, R(t)=12+6τ\n\n0 in [L,R]? L(t)=1+6τ >=1>0, so always >0, never covers 0.\n\nSo for freeway 8, both cars, L(t) >=1 >0, so never covers x=0. Always safe.\n\nSummary of when each freeway is occupied at x=0:\n\n- Freeway 1: only at t=78\n\n- Freeway 2: only at t=78 (same as f1)\n\n- Freeway 3: at t=78 and t=82\n\n- Freeway 4: at t=78 and t=82 (same as f3)\n\n- Freeway 5: at t=78 and t=82 (same)\n\n- Freeway 6: never\n\n- Freeway 7: never\n\n- Freeway 8: never\n\nNow, player starts at t=78, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe path: at each turn, we choose action U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, 0.\n\ny must be in [0,9].\n\nWe need to be on freeways only when they are safe.\n\nSpecifically, at turn t, if we are on freeway y (1-8), then at that time t, freeway y must not be occupied, i.e., no car covering x=0.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 have no cars, always safe.\n\nStart at t=78, y=0, safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal turns: since we start at y=0, need to increase to y=9, at least 9 actions of U, but we can have S or D, which add turns, so minimal H is at least 9, if we go up every turn.\n\nBut we might need to wait if blocked.\n\nNow, let's see the freeways that are blocked at certain times.\n\nFirst, at t=78, freeways 1,2,3,4,5 are occupied? Freeway 3,4,5 at t=78 occupied, and f1,f2 at t=78.\n\nBut at t=78, player is at y=0, not on freeway.\n\nNow, we need to move up.\n\nSuppose we try to go directly up.\n\nAt t=78, y=0.\n\nWe choose action for t=78, which determines y_{79}.\n\nAction at turn t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t, we are at y_t, choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAt turn t, when we are at y_t, we check if y_t is freeway (1-8), and if so, whether occupied at time t.\n\nThen we choose action, go to y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nStart: t=78, y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nNow, choose a_{78}: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, y_{79} = 0 +1 =1\n\nIf D, y_{79} =0-1= -1, but y must be >=0, I think, since y=0,1,2,...,9, so y_{t+1} in [0,9], so from y=0, D is invalid? The player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so if y_t=0, a_t=D would give y_{t+1}= -1, which is invalid, so probably not allowed. Similarly, at y=9, U not allowed.\n\nIn the dynamics, it says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so actions are constrained such that y stays in bounds.\n\nSo from y=0, possible actions: U or S (since D would make y=-1 invalid)\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, D or S.\n\nNow back to t=78.\n\ny=0, safe.\n\nChoose a_{78}:\n\nIf S, y_{79}=0, still at start, not progress.\n\nTo go up, better to go U.\n\nIf U, y_{79}=1.\n\nAt t=79, y=1, which is freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 is occupied only at t=78, not at t=79.\n\nAt t=79, τ=1, freeway 1: L= -24-36= -60, R=11-36= -25, so not covering 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1 safe at t=79.\n\nSo at t=79, y=1, freeway 1 not occupied, safe.\n\nThen we can choose a_{79}, say U, to go to y=2 at t=80.\n\nNow, freeway 2: at t=80, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 2 same as freeway 1, occupied only at t=78.\n\nAt t=80, τ=2, L= -24-72= -96, R=11-72= -61, not cover 0, safe.\n\nSo y=2 at t=80, safe.\n\nThen a_{80}, U, to y=3 at t=81.\n\nFreeway 3 at t=81: is it occupied?\n\nFreeway 3 occupied at t=78 and t=82.\n\nt=81, τ=3.\n\nCar1: at τ=3, L= -59 +12*3= -59+36= -23, R= -48+36= -12, not cover 0.\n\nCar2: never\n\nCar3: at τ=3, L= -11 +36=25? R=0+36=36, [25,36], not cover 0.\n\nSo freeway 3 safe at t=81.\n\nThus y=3 at t=81 safe.\n\nThen a_{81}, U, to y=4 at t=82.\n\nNow t=82, y=4.\n\nFreeway 4 is occupied at t=82? Freeway 4 same as freeway 3, occupied at t=82.\n\nt=82, τ=4.\n\nFor freeway 4 (and 3,5), at τ=4, car1: L= -59+48= -11, R= -48+48=0, so [ -11,0], 0 included, so occupied.\n\nThus at t=82, freeway 4 is occupied.\n\nBut player at t=82 is on y=4, which is freeway 4, and it is occupied, so collision!\n\nProblem.\n\nSo if we go straight up, at t=82 we are on y=4 when it is occupied.\n\nNot safe.\n\nWe need to avoid this.\n\nPossible ways: delay going up, or go down, or at t=81, instead of going to y=4 at t=82, we can stay or go down.\n\nBut we want minimal turns.\n\nSince freeway 4 is occupied only at t=82, we can be on y=4 at other times.\n\nIn the path above, at t=81, we are at y=3.\n\nIf at t=81, we do not go up, but stay or go down.\n\nBut going down might not help.\n\nSince the blockage is at t=82 for freeways 3,4,5? Freeways 3,4,5 are occupied at t=82.\n\nFreeway 3,4,5 all have the same cars, so same occupation times.\n\nAt t=82, if we are on y=3,4, or 5, it would be occupied.\n\nBut y=3 is freeway 3, which at t=82 is occupied.\n\nSimilarly y=4 and y=5.\n\nNow, freeways 6,7,8 are always safe.\n\nBut we need to go through.\n\nMinimal H: we need to reach y=9 from y=0, with at least 9 up moves.\n\nBut we may need to wait.\n\nAt t=81, y=3, if we go up to y=4 at t=82, collision.\n\nIf we stay at y=3 at t=82, but at t=82, y=3 is freeway 3, which is occupied, so if we are on y=3 at t=82, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to y=2 at t=82, y=2 is freeway 2, which is safe at t=82, since only occupied at t=78.\n\nBut going down might delay.\n\nWe need to not be on freeways 3,4,5 at t=82.\n\nAt t=82, we should be on a safe freeway or y=0 or 9.\n\nBut y=0 or 9 not likely.\n\nSafe freeways at t=82: freeway 1,2,6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 1: occupied only t=78, so at t=82 safe.\n\nFreeway 2 same.\n\nFreeway 6,7,8 always safe.\n\nFreeway 3,4,5 occupied at t=82.\n\nSo at t=82, we can be on y=1,2,6,7,8.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nStart t=78, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince freeways 6,7,8 are always safe, we can go up to them quickly.\n\nBut we have to go through the lower freeways first.\n\nList the freeways and their safe times.\n\nFor freeway 1: safe for all t except t=78\n\nSimilarly freeway 2: safe except t=78\n\nFreeway 3: safe except t=78 and t=82\n\nSimilarly for 4 and 5.\n\nFreeway 6,7,8: always safe.\n\nNow, we start at t=78, y=0.\n\nAt t=78, we can choose to go up or stay.\n\nIf we go up to y=1 at t=79.\n\nt=79: y=1, freeway 1, which is safe (since not t=78), so ok.\n\nThen we can go up to y=2 at t=80.\n\nt=80: y=2, freeway 2, safe (not t=78), ok.\n\nThen to y=3 at t=81.\n\nt=81: y=3, freeway 3.\n\nAt t=81, freeway 3 is safe? Earlier at τ=3, not occupied, yes.\n\nNow at t=81, y=3, safe.\n\nNow, at t=81, we choose action for y_{82}.\n\nIf we go up to y=4 at t=82, but at t=82, y=4 would be on freeway 4, occupied, collision.\n\nIf we stay, y=3 at t=82, on freeway 3, occupied at t=82, collision.\n\nIf we go down, to y=2 at t=82.\n\nThen at t=82, y=2, freeway 2, which is safe at t=82, since not occupied.\n\nSo we can do that.\n\nThen at t=82, y=2.\n\nNow, we are at y=2 at t=82.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nBut we have to go through freeways 3,4,5 at some point.\n\nFreeways 3,4,5 are safe except at t=78 and t=82.\n\nt=78 is past, so only avoid t=82.\n\nAfter t=82, they are safe.\n\nFor example, at t=83, freeway 3: τ=5, car1: L= -59+60=1, R=12, not cover 0; car3: L= -11+60=49? R=60, not cover 0; car2 never, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo after t=82, freeways 3,4,5 are safe.\n\nNow at t=82, we are at y=2.\n\nWe can go up to y=3 at t=83.\n\nt=83, y=3, freeway 3, safe since t>82.\n\nThen up to y=4 at t=84, freeway 4, safe.\n\nThen y=5 at t=85, freeway 5, safe.\n\nThen y=6 at t=86, freeway 6, always safe.\n\nThen y=7 at t=87, freeway 7, safe.\n\ny=8 at t=88, freeway 8, safe.\n\nThen y=9 at t=89.\n\nBut y=9 at t=89, which is the goal.\n\nNow, let's see the turns.\n\nStart: t=78, y=0\n\na_{78}: U, to y=1 at t=79\n\nt=79, y=1\n\na_{79}: U, to y=2 at t=80\n\nt=80, y=2\n\na_{80}: U, to y=3 at t=81\n\nt=81, y=3\n\nNow at t=81, to avoid collision at t=82, we go down: a_{81}: D, to y=2 at t=82? a_{81} action at t=81, so y_{82} = y_{81} + Δy\n\nAt t=81, y=3, a_{81}=D, then y_{82} = 3 -1 =2\n\nThen t=82, y=2\n\nNow y=2 is freeway 2, and at t=82, it is safe, as we said.\n\nThen a_{82}: U, to y=3 at t=83\n\nt=83, y=3, freeway 3, safe (τ=5, not occupied)\n\na_{83}: U, to y=4 at t=84\n\nt=84, y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\na_{84}: U, to y=5 at t=85\n\nt=85, y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\na_{85}: U, to y=6 at t=86\n\nt=86, y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\na_{86}: U, to y=7 at t=87\n\nt=87, y=7, freeway 7, safe\n\na_{87}: U, to y=8 at t=88\n\nt=88, y=8, freeway 8, safe\n\na_{88}: U, to y=9 at t=89\n\nt=89, y=9, goal.\n\nNow, H is the number of turns from t_1 to when we reach y=9.\n\nWe start at turn t_1=78, position (0,0)\n\nAfter H turns, we are at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=78 to t=78+H-1 for H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we have done H steps.\n\nAt turn t, after action, we move to y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, choose action, then at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at turn 78, y_78 = 0.\n\nAfter 0 actions, we are at turn 78.\n\nAfter first action (at t=78), we go to y_79 at turn 79.\n\nAfter second action (at t=79), to y_80 at turn 80, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, we are at turn 78 + k, at position y_{78+k}.\n\nWe reach y=9 when y_{78+k} =9 for some k.\n\nThen H = k, the number of actions.\n\nFrom above, at turn 89, y=9, so k=11, since from 78 to 89 is 11 turns? Turns: 78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89.\n\nStart at t=78, after 0 actions.\n\nAfter 1 action (t=78), at t=79, y=1\n\nAfter 2 actions (t=79), at t=80, y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter 11 actions: let's list:\n\nAction at t=78: to y=1 at t=79\n\nAction at t=79: to y=2 at t=80\n\nAction at t=80: to y=3 at t=81\n\nAction at t=81: to y=2 at t=82? In our plan, at t=81, we go down to y=2 at t=82.\n\nThen action at t=82: to y=3 at t=83\n\nAction at t=83: to y=4 at t=84\n\n...\n\nAction at t=88: to y=9 at t=89\n\nNow, at t=89, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=78 to t=88, that's 11 actions (t=78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88), and at t=89 we are at y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, and after H actions, we reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nIn the answer format, it says: sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H-1.\n\nThen after these H actions, at turn t_1 + H, we are at the position.\n\nStart: at turn t_1, before any action, position (0, y_{t_1})\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1 +1, position y_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H-1}, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, t_1=78, we reach y=9 at t=89, so t_1 + H =89, so 78 + H =89, H=11.\n\nActions from t=78 to t=78+10? t from 0 to H-1, actions at t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nH actions at times: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H-1.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nHere t_1 + H =89, t_1=78, so H=11.\n\nActions at t=78 to t=88 inclusive, that's 11 actions: 78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88.\n\nIn our sequence:\n\nAt t=78: U\n\nt=79: U\n\nt=80: U\n\nt=81: D (down to y=2 at t=82)\n\nt=82: U (to y=3 at t=83)\n\nt=83: U (to y=4 at t=84)\n\nt=84: U (to y=5 at t=85)\n\nt=85: U (to y=6 at t=86)\n\nt=86: U (to y=7 at t=87)\n\nt=87: U (to y=8 at t=88)\n\nt=88: U (to y=9 at t=89)\n\nIn the action at t=81: D, to y=2 at t=82\n\nThen at t=82: U, to y=3 at t=83\n\nBut at t=82, we are at y=2, which is freeway 2, and it is safe, as occupied only at t=78.\n\nThen we go up to y=3 at t=83, which is after t=82, so freeway 3 safe.\n\nIs there a shorter way?\n\nPerhaps we can avoid going down.\n\nFor example, at t=81, instead of going down, we could stay, but if we stay at y=3 at t=82, it is occupied, collision.\n\nWe could go up later.\n\nSince freeways 3,4,5 are blocked only at t=82, we can be on them before or after.\n\nIn the initial path, at t=81 we are at y=3, which is before t=82, safe.\n\nBut we need to go to y=4, which at t=82 is bad.\n\nWe could delay the upward movement.\n\nStart at t=78, y=0.\n\nInstead of going up immediately, stay at y=0 for some turns.\n\nBut that might add more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=78, we do S, stay at y=0 at t=79.\n\nThen at t=79, we can go up to y=1 at t=80, etc., but we will still hit the t=82 problem on y=4 or something.\n\nSimilar issue.\n\nAt t=78, go up to y=1 at t=79.\n\nThen at t=79, stay at y=1, so a_{79}=S, then y_{80}=1.\n\nThen at t=80, go to y=2 at t=81.\n\nt=81, y=2? Let's see:\n\nt=78: a=U, to y=1 at t=79\n\nt=79: a=S, to y=1 at t=80? a_{79} action at t=79, to y_{80}.\n\nIf a_{79}=S, y_{80}=y_{79} +0 =1\n\nThen t=80: y=1\n\na_{80}: U, to y=2 at t=81\n\nt=81: y=2\n\na_{81}: U, to y=3 at t=82\n\nt=82: y=3, but freeway 3 occupied at t=82, collision.\n\nSame problem.\n\nAt t=81, from y=2, if we go directly to y=4? No, can only change by 1.\n\nWe have to go step by step.\n\nAnother idea: since freeways 6,7,8 are always safe, we can go to them faster, but we need to pass through lower ones.\n\nFreeway 1 and 2 are safe except t=78, so we can go through quickly.\n\nThe problem is freeways 3,4,5 at t=82.\n\nWe need to not be on them at t=82.\n\nAt t=82, we can be on y=1,2,6,7,8.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=82, we can go up to y=3 at t=83, safe.\n\nBut we need to get to y=5 or above to go to 6, etc.\n\nIn our first plan, we went down at t=81 to avoid.\n\nPerhaps we can go up to y=5 before t=82.\n\nFor example, start earlier.\n\nAt t=78, y=0, go U to y=1 at t=79\n\nt=79, y=1, go U to y=2 at t=80\n\nt=80, y=2, go U to y=3 at t=81\n\nt=81, y=3, now instead of down, go U to y=4 at t=82, but collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt t=80, from y=2, go directly to y=4? No, only to y=3 or stay or down.\n\nSo we cannot skip.\n\nAnother possibility: at t=81, from y=3, go down to y=2 at t=82, as before.\n\nBut that costs an extra down and up, so two extra actions.\n\nIn terms of turns, from y=0 to y=9, min 9 up moves.\n\nIn our sequence, we have 10 up moves and one down move? Let's count the actions.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=78: U (up)\n\nt=79: U\n\nt=80: U\n\nt=81: D (down)\n\nt=82: U\n\nt=83: U\n\nt=84: U\n\nt=85: U\n\nt=86: U\n\nt=87: U\n\nt=88: U\n\nSo actions: U,U,U,D,U,U,U,U,U,U,U\n\nThat's 11 actions: 10 U and 1 D.\n\nNet y change: +10 -1 = +9, from 0 to 9.\n\nBut min is 9, so we have one extra action.\n\nCan we do with 10 actions?\n\nThat means 9 up and one other, but since we need net +9, if we have a down, we need an extra up, so 10 up and one down, total 11, or 9 up and one stay, but stay doesn't help progress.\n\nWith 9 up moves and possibly stays, but if we stay, we add turns without progress.\n\nMinimal actions is 9, all up, but we couldn't because of collision.\n\nIs it possible to go all up without collision?\n\nOnly if we avoid being on freeway 3,4,5 at t=82.\n\nBut to go from y=2 to y=3 to y=4 etc., around t=82.\n\nSuppose we reach y=3 earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=78: U to y=1 at 79\n\nBut at t=79, if we go U to y=2 at 80, then U to y=3 at 81.\n\nAt t=81, y=3, which is before t=82, safe.\n\nBut we need to go to y=4, which must be at some turn.\n\nIf we go at t=81 to y=4 at t=82, collision.\n\nIf we go later, we need to stay or something.\n\nFor example, at t=81, from y=3, we stay: a_{81}=S, then y_{82}=3.\n\nBut at t=82, y=3, on freeway 3, occupied, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf we go down to y=2 at t=82, as before.\n\nThen we lose progress.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=5 at t=82.\n\nBut y=5 is freeway 5, occupied at t=82, so if on y=5 at t=82, collision.\n\nSimilarly, cannot.\n\nOr y=6 at t=82.\n\ny=6 is freeway 6, always safe.\n\nBut to be at y=6 at t=82.\n\nStart from y=0 at t=78.\n\nAt t=78: U to y=1 at 79\n\nt=79: U to y=2 at 80\n\nt=80: U to y=3 at 81\n\nt=81: U to y=4 at 82? But at t=82 y=4 occupied.\n\nNot possible.\n\nTo reach y=6 at t=82, we need to be at y=5 at t=81, then U to y=6 at t=82.\n\nBut at t=81, if at y=5, freeway 5, which is safe at t=81? Freeway 5 occupied at t=78 and t=82, not at t=81.\n\nAt t=81, τ=3, freeway 5 same as 3, safe.\n\nSo at t=81, y=5 is safe.\n\nThen a_{81}=U, to y=6 at t=82.\n\nAt t=82, y=6, freeway 6, always safe.\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\nBut how to be at y=5 at t=81.\n\nFrom start.\n\nt=78: y=0, a=U, to y=1 at 79\n\nt=79: y=1, a=U, to y=2 at 80\n\nt=80: y=2, now to go to y=5 at t=81? Not possible, since only one step to y=3.\n\nAt t=80, y=2, we can go to y=3 at t=81.\n\nTo be at y=5 at t=81, we need to be at y=4 at t=80, for example.\n\nBut at t=80, y=4.\n\nHow?\n\nStart t=78: U to y=1 at 79\n\nt=79: U to y=2 at 80\n\nt=80: y=2, not y=4.\n\nCannot jump.\n\nTo be at higher y earlier, we need to go up faster, but we start from 0.\n\nAt t=78, if we go U, at t=79 y=1\n\nThen at t=79, U, at t=80 y=2\n\nThen at t=80, U, at t=81 y=3\n\nThen to y=5 at t=81 impossible.\n\nPerhaps start later, but we start at t=78.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 1 and 2 are safe except t=78, we can stay at y=0 for one turn to avoid, but y=0 has no issue.\n\nBut at t=78, if we stay at y=0, then at t=79 y=0.\n\nThen at t=79, go U to y=1 at 80.\n\nThen t=80, y=1, go U to y=2 at 81.\n\nt=81, y=2, go U to y=3 at 82, but at t=82 y=3 occupied.\n\nSame as before.\n\nt=81, y=2, go directly to y=4? No.\n\nSo seems we cannot avoid the issue at t=82 without an extra move.\n\nPerhaps go down earlier.\n\nFor example, from y=3 at t=81, go down to y=2 at t=82, as in first plan.\n\nThen we have 11 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach with 10 actions.\n\nSuppose H=10, so actions from t=78 to t=87, reach y=9 at t=88.\n\nt_1 + H =88, 78 + H=88, H=10.\n\nThen y at t=88 should be 9.\n\nBut to have net +9 in 10 actions, we need exactly 9 up and one other action, which must be stay or down.\n\nIf down, we need 10 up to compensate, but 10 up would be +10, too much, so must have 9 up and one stay.\n\nSo actions: 9 U and 1 S.\n\nNow, the stay can be at some point.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at t=88.\n\nSince we start at y=0 at t=78, after 10 actions, at t=88 y=9.\n\nNow, the position over time.\n\nSuppose we have a stay action at some turn.\n\nBut we need to avoid the collision at t=82.\n\nSpecifically, at t=82, we should not be on freeway 3,4,5.\n\nPossible positions: y=0,1,2,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=9 not yet.\n\nAt t=82, y could be 1,2,6,7,8.\n\nNow, to be at y=6,7,8 at t=82, we need to have reached there earlier.\n\nFor example, to be at y=6 at t=82.\n\nThen at t=81, we need to be at y=5 or y=6 or y=7.\n\nIf at y=5 at t=81, then a_{81}=U to y=6 at t=82.\n\nOr if at y=6 at t=81, a_{81}=S to y=6 at t=82.\n\nOr a_{81}=D to y=5, but not to y=6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at t=81.\n\ny=5 at t=81.\n\nFrom start: at t=78 y=0\n\nAfter 3 actions, at t=81, y=?\n\nAt t=78: action, to y at 79\n\nt=79: action, to y at 80\n\nt=80: action, to y at 81\n\nWith three actions, we can be at y=3, if all U.\n\nFor example: t=78 U to y1 at79\n\nt=79 U to y2 at80\n\nt=80 U to y3 at81\n\nSo at t=81 y=3.\n\nTo be at y=5, impossible with three actions from y=0.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be higher.\n\nAt t=81, max y=3.\n\nThen at t=81, y=3, we can go to y=4 at t=82, but collision.\n\nOr stay, y=3 at t=82, collision.\n\nOr down to y=2 at t=82.\n\nThen at t=82 y=2.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 at t=88 with 10 actions? H=10, reach at t=88.\n\nFrom t=82 y=2 to t=88 y=9, need to go up 7 steps, which takes 7 actions: from t=82 to t=88 is 6 turns? Let's see.\n\nAt t=82, after action? At turn t=82, we are at y=2.\n\nThen we choose actions from t=82 to t=87 for H=10? If H=10, actions from t=78 to t=87.\n\nt=87 action to y at t=88.\n\nFrom t=82 to t=87, we have actions at t=82,83,84,85,86,87.\n\nThat's 6 actions.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9, need +7, so with 6 actions, we need to increase by 7, impossible, since max +1 per action.\n\n6 actions can increase by at most 6, from y=2 to y=8.\n\nThen to y=9 need another action.\n\nSo from y=2 at t=82, to reach y=9 at t=88, we need 7 actions: at t=82 to t=88 actions, to y at t=83 to t=89.\n\nBut t=89 is after t=88.\n\nWith actions at t=82 to t=88, 7 actions, to y at t=83 to t=89.\n\nAt t=89 y=9.\n\nBut for H=10, we reach at t=88, which is earlier.\n\nIn the H=10 case, we need to be at y=9 at t=88.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=82, to y=9 at t=88, we need to go from y=2 to y=9 in 6 steps: from turn t=82 to t=88, positions y at t=83 to t=89? Confusing.\n\nAt time t=82, position y=2.\n\nAfter first action (at t=82), at t=83, y=?\n\n...\n\nAfter k-th action from here, at t=82 + k.\n\nTo be at y=9 at t=88.\n\nt=88 is the time when position is y=9.\n\nSo from t=82 to t=88, that is 6 turns later? Time from t=82 to t=88 is 6 units? t=82,83,84,85,86,87,88: that's 7 times.\n\nAt t=82: y=2\n\nAt t=83: after action at t=82\n\nAt t=84: after action at t=83\n\n...\n\nAt t=88: after action at t=87\n\nTo have y=9 at t=88, we need to reach in 6 actions from t=82 to t=87.\n\nActions at t=82,83,84,85,86,87 to set y at t=83,84,85,86,87,88.\n\nAt t=88, y=9.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9, delta +7, with 6 actions, impossible since each action can increase by at most 1.\n\nMax y at t=88 is y=2 +6 =8, if all up actions.\n\nThen need one more action to go to y=9.\n\nThus, cannot reach y=9 at t=88 from y=2 at t=82.\n\nIf at t=82 we are at higher y, but earlier we cannot be higher than y=2 at t=82 in a minimal path.\n\nIn the sequence with down, at t=82 we are at y=2.\n\nTo reach earlier, but we start at t=78 y=0, and min to y=9 is 9 actions, reaching at t=87.\n\nt_1 + H = t_1 + H.\n\nStart t=78, after H actions, at t=78+H.\n\nSet to 9.\n\nMin H=9, t=87.\n\nBut can we reach y=9 at t=87?\n\nThat means at t=87, y=9.\n\nWith H=9 actions: actions at t=78 to t=86, to y at t=79 to t=87.\n\nAt t=87 y=9.\n\nNow, to avoid collision at t=82.\n\nAt t=82, we need to not be on freeway 3,4,5.\n\nSo y not 3,4,5 at t=82.\n\nPossible y=1,2,6,7,8 at t=82.\n\nBut to be at y=6,7,8 at t=82, we need to have reached high earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=82, y=6.\n\nThen at t=81, y must be 5 or 6.\n\nIf y=5 at t=81, or y=6 at t=81.\n\nNow, at t=81, y=5: freeway 5, which is safe at t=81, as we said.\n\nThen a_{81}=U to y=6 at t=82.\n\nNow, how to be at y=5 at t=81.\n\nFrom start: t=78 y=0, a=U to y1 at79\n\nt=79 a=U to y2 at80\n\nt=80 a=U to y3 at81? At t=80 action to y at t=81.\n\nIf at t=80, we are at y=2, a=U to y=3 at t=81.\n\nTo be at y=5 at t=81, need to be at y=4 at t=80.\n\nAt t=80, y=4.\n\nHow?\n\nFrom t=78: U to y1 at79\n\nt=79: U to y2 at80? a_{79} to y at t=80.\n\nIf a_{79}=U, y_{80}=2.\n\nThen at t=80, y=2.\n\nCannot be at y=4.\n\nIf at t=79, we are at higher, but at t=79, max y=1 (if started with U at t=78).\n\nSo impossible to be at y=4 or higher at t=80.\n\nThus, at t=81, max y=3.\n\nTherefore, at t=82, if we go up, y=4, collision, or stay y=3 collision, or down y=2.\n\nThen at t=82 y=2.\n\nThen to reach y=9 at t=87 with H=9? Actions from t=78 to t=86.\n\nAt t=86 action to y at t=87.\n\nFrom t=82 y=2 to t=87 y=9.\n\nAt t=82: y=2\n\nAfter actions at t=82 to t=86 (5 actions), to y at t=83 to t=87.\n\nAt t=87 y=9.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9, need +7, with 5 actions, impossible.\n\nMax y=2+5=7 at t=87.\n\nThen need more actions.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11, as in the first plan.\n\nPerhaps we can have the stay action to wait.\n\nBut with stay, we add delay.\n\nFor example, at some point before, we stay to avoid being at critical point.\n\nBut at t=82, we must not be on y=3,4,5.\n\nSuppose at t=81, we are at y=2.\n\nHow? For example, start t=78: U to y1 at79\n\nt=79: S stay at y1? a_{79}=S, y_{80}=1\n\nThen t=80: y=1, a=U to y2 at81\n\nt=81: y=2\n\nNow at t=81, y=2, we can go U to y=3 at t=82, but at t=82 y=3 occupied, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt t=81, from y=2, go S to y=2 at t=82.\n\nAt t=82, y=2, freeway 2, safe.\n\nThen we can go up from there.\n\nBut now we have a stay.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=78: U to y1 at79\n\nt=79: S to y1 at80? a_{79}=S, y_{80}=y_{79}=1 (since at t=79 y=1)\n\ny_{79}=1, a_{79}=S, Δy=0, so y_{80}=1\n\nt=80: y=1, a=U to y2 at81\n\nt=81: y=2, a=S to y2 at82? a_{81}=S, y_{82}=2\n\nt=82: y=2, safe\n\nThen a_{82}: U to y3 at83\n\nt=83: y=3, safe\n\na_{83}: U to y4 at84\n\n...\n\nUp to y9 at t=89? Let's see when we reach y9.\n\nFrom t=82 y=2\n\nt=82: U to y3 at83\n\nt=83: U to y4 at84\n\nt=84: U to y5 at85\n\nt=85: U to y6 at86\n\nt=86: U to y7 at87\n\nt=87: U to y8 at88\n\nt=88: U to y9 at89\n\nSame as before, reach at t=89.\n\nWith the stay at t=79 or t=81, we still reach at t=89.\n\nIn this case, actions: t=78 U, t=79 S, t=80 U, t=81 S, t=82 U, ..., up to t=88 U, to y9 at89.\n\n11 actions, same H.\n\nBut we have two stays, net up moves less, so need more up actions.\n\nIn this, from t=78 to t=88 actions: 11 actions.\n\ny: start 0, after U to1, S to1, U to2, S to2, U to3, U to4, U to5, U to6, U to7, U to8, U to9. So net +9 with 9 up and 2 stays, total 11 actions.\n\nWorse than before.\n\nIn first plan, 10 up and 1 down, also 11 actions.\n\nBut down and up cancel, same net.\n\nNow, back to the first plan, with down at t=81.\n\nBut in that plan, at t=81 we go down to y=2 at t=82.\n\nIs there a freeway at y=2? Yes, freeway 2.\n\nAnd at t=82, freeway 2 is safe.\n\nThen we go up.\n\nBut we have to specify the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we also need to go through freeway 5, etc., but in this case, after t=82, all safe.\n\nIn freeway 5, occupied only t=78 and t=82, so after t=82 safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the action sequence:\n\nTurn t_1=78: a_{78} = U  (to y=1 at t=79)\n\nTurn t_1+1=79: a_{79} = U  (to y=2 at t=80)\n\nTurn t_1+2=80: a_{80} = U  (to y=3 at t=81)\n\nTurn t_1+3=81: a_{81} = D  (to y=2 at t=82)  // down to avoid\n\nTurn t_1+4=82: a_{82} = U  (to y=3 at t=83)\n\nTurn t_1+5=83: a_{83} = U  (to y=4 at t=84)\n\nTurn t_1+6=84: a_{84} = U  (to y=5 at t=85)\n\nTurn t_1+7=85: a_{85} = U  (to y=6 at t=86)\n\nTurn t_1+8=86: a_{86} = U  (to y=7 at t=87)\n\nTurn t_1+9=87: a_{87} = U  (to y=8 at t=88)\n\nTurn t_1+10=88: a_{88} = U  (to y=9 at t=89)\n\nH=11, since actions from t=78 to t=88, t from 0 to 10? t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1=78, t from 0 to 10, that's 11 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t_1 + t, action.\n\nIn answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nAnd after that, at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nHere t_1 + H =89, H=11.\n\nSo actions from t=78 to t=88.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have a_{81}=D, which is down.\n\nBut is there a way without down?\n\nPerhaps we can go to freeway 6 directly or something, but no.\n\nAnother thought: since freeway 8 has a car at (12,1,right,6), but at x=0 not covered, so safe.\n\nBut we don't need to care.\n\nPerhaps at t=82, we can be on y=6 if we had reached earlier, but impossible.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8: cars at (60,49,right,6) and (12,1,right,6)\n\nBoth L(t) >0 for all t, since min L is 1 for second car, so x=0 never covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo the sequence should be fine.\n\nNow, in the action at t=81, we go down to y=2.\n\nBut y=2 at t=82 is freeway 2, safe.\n\nThen up.\n\nPerhaps we can go down at different time, but same.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n\nThus, H=11, sequence:\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: D\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nIn the turn numbering: t_1=78, so\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1+1: U\n\nTurn t_1+2: U\n\nTurn t_1+3: D\n\nTurn t_1+4: U\n\nTurn t_1+5: U\n\nTurn t_1+6: U\n\nTurn t_1+7: U\n\nTurn t_1+8: U\n\nTurn t_1+9: U\n\nTurn t_1+10: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn t_1+3 is 81, D.\n\nThen turn t_1+4 is 82, U, to y=3 at 83.\n\nBut at t=83, y=3, freeway 3, which is safe, as τ=5, etc.\n\nThen up to y=4 at 84, freeway 4 safe, and so on.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut the player reaches (0,9) at turn 89.\n\nBut we need the sequence.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 3,4,5, there is a car at (0,-11,right,12) which at t=78 covers x=0, but at that time player is at y=0, not on freeway.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo I think this works.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 78\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by moving down at turn \\(t_1 + 3 = 81\\) to avoid being on freeways 3, 4, or 5 at turn \\(t_1 + 4 = 82\\), when these freeways are occupied at \\(x = 0\\).\n\n### Sequence of Actions:\n- At turn 78 (\\(t_1\\)), move up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 79.\n- At turn 79, move up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 80.\n- At turn 80, move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 81.\n- At turn 81, move down to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 82 to avoid collision on freeway 3 at turn 82.\n- At turn 82, move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 83 (freeway 3 is now safe after turn 82).\n- At turn 83, move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 84.\n- At turn 84, move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 85.\n- At turn 85, move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 86.\n- At turn 86, move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 87.\n- At turn 87, move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 88.\n- At turn 88, move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 89.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 89 (\\(t_1 + 11\\)) with no collisions, as freeways 1 and 2 are only occupied at turn 78 (when the player is not on them), freeways 3, 4, and 5 are avoided at turn 82 by being on freeway 2 (which is safe), and freeways 6, 7, and 8 are always safe.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Freeway 1 & 2**: Occupied only at turn 78. Player is on freeway 1 at turn 79 and freeway 2 at turn 80 and 82, all safe times.\n- **Freeway 3, 4, & 5**: Occupied at turns 78 and 82. Player is on freeway 3 at turn 81 (safe, as not occupied) and avoids it at turn 82 by moving to freeway 2. Player is on freeway 4 at turn 84 and freeway 5 at turn 85, both after turn 82, so safe.\n- **Freeway 6, 7, & 8**: Always safe, as no car covers \\(x = 0\\) at any time. Player is on them from turns 86 to 88 with no issues.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 78: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 79: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 80: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 81: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 82: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 83: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 84: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For left-moving cars, the span moves left as time increases; for right-moving, it moves right. A collision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nImportantly, when you move to a new y, you're not on that y until the next turn. So if you move up to y+1 at turn T, you're on y at turn T, and you arrive at y+1 at turn T+1. So for collision, at turn T, we care about the car spans on the current y at that exact turn.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9. Since we start at (0,0) at turn t1=82, and we need to get to (0,9).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. The car positions are given at turn t1=82.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway at t=82.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head=48, tail=83, direction left, speed=36. Since it's left-moving, span at t=82 is [h, τ] = [48, 83]. But head and tail: for left-moving, it says span(t1) = [h, τ], and it moves left, so at time T, span is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h], I think, no.\n\nLook: for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 3,4,5, it has multiple cars, like (48,37,right,12), etc.\n\nSo for each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nNow, for collision: at turn T, if player is on freeway y, and for any car on y, 0 is in the car's span at T.\n\nPlayer is on y at turn T only if that's the position after the action, but since actions are taken at each turn, position at turn T is y_T, and we check collision at that turn.\n\nLet me denote t1 = 82.\n\nSo at turn T, player is at y_T.\n\nIf y_T is between 1 and 8, we need to ensure that for all cars on freeway y_T, 0 is not in their span at turn T.\n\nNow, for freeway k, the cars are given, and we can compute their span at any T.\n\nAlso, note that for different freeways, the cars are different.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at t=82. y=0 is not a freeway, I think freeways are y=1 to y=8, so at y=0, no cars, so no collision possible. Similarly, at y=9, no cars, but we need to reach (0,9), so when we are at y=9, it's safe.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8\", so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so safe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=0, we need to move up through the freeways.\n\nSince we can only change y by at most 1 per turn, the minimal H would be at least 9, to go from 0 to 9, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 9.\n\nBut we need minimal H.\n\nNow, let's list the car spans at t=82 for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: y=1, one car: (h=48, τ=83, left, s=36)\n\nSince left-moving, at t=82, span is [h, τ] = [48, 83]\n\nAt time T, span is [48 - 36(T-82), 83 - 36(T-82)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: y=2, same as freeway 1: (48,83,left,36), so span at T: [48-36(T-82), 83-36(T-82)]\n\nFreeway 3: y=3, three cars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving cars, span(t1) = [τ, h], and moves right.\n\nFor first car: (48,37,right,12), so at t1, τ=37, h=48, so span = [37,48]\n\nAt T, span = [37 + 12(T-82), 48 + 12(T-82)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,12), τ=1, h=12, span at t1 [1,12], at T [1 + 12(T-82), 12 + 12(T-82)]\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12), τ=-35, h=-24, span at t1 [-35,-24], at T [-35 + 12(T-82), -24 + 12(T-82)]\n\nFreeway 4: y=4, same as freeway 3: three cars identical to y=3.\n\n(48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nSo same spans as y=3.\n\nFreeway 5: y=5, same as y=3 and y=4.\n\nFreeway 6: y=6, one car: (48,37,right,6)\n\nSo right-moving, τ=37, h=48, span at t1 [37,48], at T [37 + 6(T-82), 48 + 6(T-82)]\n\nFreeway 7: y=7, one car: (48,37,right,6), same as y=6.\n\nFreeway 8: y=8, two cars: (48,37,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: same as above, span at T [37 + 6(T-82), 48 + 6(T-82)]\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6), so τ=-11, h=0, span at t1 [-11,0], at T [-11 + 6(T-82), 0 + 6(T-82)] = [-11 + 6(T-82), 6(T-82)]\n\nNow, player starts at t=82, y=0.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nSince we can only move one step per turn, the path must go through y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 at some points, but we can stay or move down, so we might not be on each y at consecutive turns.\n\nTo minimize turns, we probably want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when a car span covers 0.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we need to find when it is safe to be on that y, i.e., when no car on that y has 0 in its span.\n\nSince multiple cars, we need 0 not in any car's span for that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, since the player moves step by step, we need to be safe at each turn when on freeway y.\n\nNow, let me define the time from t1=82.\n\nSet τ = T - 82, so τ=0 at current turn.\n\nThen for each freeway, find for which τ, y=k is safe, i.e., for all cars on k, 0 not in span at time T=82+τ.\n\nStart with y=1: freeway 1, one car, left-moving, span at τ: [48 - 36τ, 83 - 36τ]\n\n0 in span if 48 - 36τ <= 0 <= 83 - 36τ\n\nSince left-moving, the span is decreasing.\n\nSo 48 - 36τ <= 0 and 0 <= 83 - 36τ\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36τ <= 0 => 36τ >= 48 => τ >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 83 - 36τ => 36τ <= 83 => τ <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSo for τ in [4/3, 83/36], approximately [1.333, 2.305], 0 is in the span, so unsafe.\n\nSince τ integer (turns), so at τ=2, 48-36*2=48-72=-24, 83-72=11, so [-24,11], 0 is between -24 and 11, yes, so unsafe.\n\nAt τ=1: 48-36=12, 83-36=47, [12,47], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt τ=0: [48,83], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt τ=3: 48-108=-60, 83-108=-25, [-60,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo for y=1, unsafe at τ=2 only? τ=2 is 2.305, τ=2 is within [1.333,2.305], yes.\n\nτ=1: 1.333, τ=1 is less than 1.333, so not unsafe.\n\nτ=1: τ=1, 36*1=36, 48-36=12, 83-36=47, [12,47], min=12>0, so 0 not in.\n\nτ=2: 36*2=72, 48-72=-24, 83-72=11, [-24,11], 0 in.\n\nτ=3: 48-108=-60, 83-108=-25, [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo y=1 is unsafe only at τ=2.\n\nτ=2 corresponds to T=82+2=84.\n\nAt τ=0 (T=82), safe; τ=1 (T=83), safe; τ=2 (T=84), unsafe; τ=3 (T=85), safe, etc.\n\nNow y=2: same as y=1, since same car configuration. So unsafe only at τ=2.\n\nNow y=3: freeway 3, three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12), span at τ: [37 + 12τ, 48 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span if 37+12τ <= 0 <= 48+12τ\n\nBut 37+12τ <=0? 12τ <= -37, impossible since τ>=0, so 37+12τ >=37>0, so min>0, 0 not in span for first car. Always safe for first car.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12), span at τ: [1 + 12τ, 12 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span if 1+12τ <=0 <=12+12τ\n\n1+12τ <=0? 12τ <=-1, impossible, τ>=0, so always min>0, 0 not in span. Safe.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12), span at τ: [-35 + 12τ, -24 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span if -35 +12τ <=0 <= -24 +12τ\n\nFirst inequality: -35 +12τ <=0 => 12τ <=35 => τ <= 35/12 ≈ 2.9167\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +12τ => 12τ >=24 => τ >=2\n\nSo τ >=2 and τ <= 2.9167, so τ=2 and τ=3? τ integer.\n\nτ=2: -35 +24 = -11, -24+24=0, so [-11,0], 0 is included? Span is [left, right], inclusive I assume.\n\nThe span is a closed interval, I think, so includes endpoints.\n\nSo at τ=2, [-11,0], 0 is in.\n\nτ=3: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], min=1>0, 0 not in.\n\nτ=1: -35+12=-23, -24+12=-12, [-23,-12], max=-12<0, 0 not in.\n\nSo for third car, unsafe at τ=2.\n\nSince only third car has 0 in span at τ=2, so for y=3, unsafe at τ=2.\n\nNow, first and second cars are always safe, but third is unsafe at τ=2, so y=3 unsafe at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=4: same as y=3, so unsafe at τ=2.\n\ny=5: same, unsafe at τ=2.\n\nNow y=6: freeway 6, one car (48,37,right,6)\n\nSpan at τ: [37 + 6τ, 48 + 6τ]\n\nMin=37+6τ >=37>0, so 0 never in span, always safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7: same car, (48,37,right,6), always safe.\n\nNow y=8: freeway 8, two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6), same as above, always safe.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6), span at τ: [-11 + 6τ, 0 + 6τ] = [-11 + 6τ, 6τ]\n\n0 in span if -11 +6τ <=0 <= 6τ\n\nFirst: -11+6τ <=0 => 6τ <=11 => τ <= 11/6 ≈ 1.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= 6τ => τ >=0, always true for τ>=0.\n\nSo τ >=0 and τ <=1.833, so τ=0,1? τ integer.\n\nτ=0: [-11,0], 0 is in.\n\nτ=1: -11+6=-5, 6*1=6, [-5,6], 0 is in since -5<=0<=6.\n\nτ=2: -11+12=1, 12, [1,12], min=1>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe for second car at τ=0 and τ=1.\n\nSince first car always safe, but second car unsafe at τ=0 and τ=1.\n\nThus y=8 unsafe at τ=0 and τ=1.\n\nτ=0 is current time, T=82.\n\nτ=1 is T=83.\n\nNow, summarize for each y, when unsafe:\n\ny=1: unsafe at τ=2 (T=84)\n\ny=2: unsafe at τ=2 (T=84)\n\ny=3: unsafe at τ=2 (T=84)\n\ny=4: unsafe at τ=2 (T=84)\n\ny=5: unsafe at τ=2 (T=84)\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: unsafe at τ=0 (T=82) and τ=1 (T=83)\n\nPlayer starts at τ=0, y=0, which is safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=6 and y=7 are always safe, we can be there any time.\n\ny=8 is unsafe at τ=0 and τ=1, but safe from τ=2 onwards.\n\ny=1 to y=5 are unsafe only at τ=2, so safe at other times.\n\nτ=2 is a problem for y=1-5.\n\nNow, to go from y=0 to y=9, minimal steps: if we go up every turn, we can reach in 9 turns: from τ=0 to τ=8, positions y=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 at turns τ=0 to τ=8.\n\nBut we need to check safety at each step when on freeway.\n\nAt τ=0, T=82: y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nThen action: at turn T, we choose action, which determines next y.\n\nLet me define the turns.\n\nAt turn T=82 (τ=0), player is at y=0.\n\nWe choose action a_{82}, which can be U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, then y_{83} = y_{82} +1 = 0+1=1\n\nIf S, y_{83}=0\n\nIf D, y_{83}= -1, but y must be >=0, so D not possible from y=0. Similarly, from y=9, U not possible.\n\ny in [0,9], so at y=0, can only U or S, not D.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, can only D or S, not U.\n\nNow at τ=0, T=82, position y=0, safe.\n\nWe choose action for T=82.\n\nIf we choose U, then at T=83, y=1.\n\nBut at T=83, y=1, which freeway? y=1 is freeway.\n\nAt T=83, τ=1.\n\nFor y=1, at τ=1, we said it is safe, since unsafe only at τ=2.\n\nEarlier: y=1 unsafe only at τ=2.\n\nτ=1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=1 at T=83.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nIn the direct path: start T=82, y=0\n\nAction at T=82: if U, then T=83, y=1\n\nAction at T=83: if U, then T=84, y=2\n\nBut at T=84, y=2, τ=2, and y=2 is unsafe at τ=2, as we saw.\n\nCollision.\n\nSimilarly, if at T=83 we do S, stay at y=1, but at T=84, y=1, τ=2, unsafe.\n\nIf at T=83 we do D, back to y=0, but then we waste time.\n\nBetter to avoid being on y=1 to y=5 at τ=2.\n\nτ=2 is T=84.\n\nSince y=6 and y=7 are always safe, we could go up to y=6 or y=7 before τ=2 or after.\n\ny=8 is unsafe at τ=0 and τ=1, but safe from τ=2.\n\nτ=0 is T=82, τ=1 T=83, τ=2 T=84.\n\nWe start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nIf we go up immediately:\n\nOption 1: all up, but at T=84, y=2, which is unsafe.\n\nSpecifically: T=82: y=0, action U? If action U at T=82, then y_{83}=1\n\nT=83: at y=1, action U, then y_{84}=2\n\nAt T=84, y=2, τ=2, unsafe.\n\nIf at T=83, we do not U, but S or D.\n\nIf S at T=83, y=1 at T=84, unsafe.\n\nIf D at T=83, y=0 at T=84, safe but not progress.\n\nThen we need to go up later.\n\nTo avoid being on y=1-5 at τ=2.\n\nSince τ=2 is only unsafe for those, and y=6,7 always safe, y=8 safe after τ=1.\n\nWe can delay going up or go faster to skip some.\n\nMinimal H might be more than 9.\n\nSince y=0 to y=9, 9 steps up, but we might need to wait.\n\nAt τ=0, we can stay at y=0 or go up to y=1.\n\nIf we go up at T=82 to y=1 at T=83 (τ=1), which is safe.\n\nThen at T=83, we are at y=1, τ=1, safe.\n\nNow, if we go up to y=2 at T=84, but at T=84, τ=2, y=2 unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot go up at T=83.\n\nWe can do something else at T=83.\n\nAt T=83, y=1, we can choose S or D.\n\nIf S, stay at y=1, then at T=84, y=1, τ=2, unsafe.\n\nIf D, go down to y=0 at T=84.\n\nAt T=84, y=0, safe, but we are back to start almost.\n\nThen we can go up later.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=6 and y=7 are always safe, we can go directly to them if possible, but we can only move one step at a time.\n\nAnother idea: stay at y=0 for some turns until τ=2 is past, but τ=2 is T=84, and we start at T=82.\n\nIf at T=82 we do S, stay at y=0, then T=83, y=0.\n\nThen at T=83, we can go U to y=1 at T=84.\n\nT=84, τ=2, y=1, but y=1 unsafe at τ=2.\n\nSame problem.\n\nIf we stay at y=0 longer.\n\nAt T=82: S, y=0\n\nT=83: S, y=0\n\nThen at T=84, if we go U, y=1 at T=85.\n\nT=85, τ=3.\n\nNow at τ=3, for y=1, is it safe? Yes, as we saw earlier, safe at τ=3.\n\nSimilarly, y=2,3,4,5 all safe at τ=3, since unsafe only at τ=2.\n\ny=6,7 always safe.\n\ny=8, at τ=3, safe, since unsafe only at τ=0,1.\n\nSo if we wait at y=0 until after τ=2.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt T=82 (τ=0): S, stay at y=0\n\nT=83 (τ=1): S, stay at y=0\n\nT=84 (τ=2): U, move to y=1 at T=85\n\nAt T=84, after action, position at T=85 is y=1.\n\nAt turn T=84, player is at y=0 (since we did S at T=83, so at T=83 y=0, and action S at T=83, so y_{84}=0)\n\nClarify:\n\nAt the start of turn T, player is at position y_T.\n\nThen we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, we check based on y_T, the position at that turn.\n\nIn this case:\n\nT=82: position y=0, choose action. If we choose S, then y_{83} = 0\n\nT=83: position y=0, choose action. If choose S, y_{84} = 0\n\nT=84: position y=0, choose action, say U, then y_{85} = 1\n\nThen at T=85: position y=1, and so on.\n\nNow, at T=85, τ=3, y=1, which is safe, as per earlier.\n\nThen we can go up each turn.\n\nFrom T=85: y=1, U to y=2 at T=86\n\nT=86: y=2, U to y=3 at T=87\n\nT=87: y=3, U to y=4 at T=88\n\nT=88: y=4, U to y=5 at T=89\n\nT=89: y=5, U to y=6 at T=90\n\nT=90: y=6, U to y=7 at T=91\n\nT=91: y=7, U to y=8 at T=92\n\nT=92: y=8, now at T=92, τ= T-82 = 92-82=10\n\ny=8 is unsafe only at τ=0 and τ=1, which are past, so at τ=10, safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at T=93.\n\nT=93: y=9, reached.\n\nNow, number of turns: from T=82 to T=93, that's 12 turns? Let's list the actions.\n\nStart at T=82, position y=0.\n\nAction at T=82: S (stay), so y_{83} = 0\n\nAction at T=83: S, y_{84} = 0\n\nAction at T=84: U, y_{85} = 1\n\nAction at T=85: U, y_{86} = 2\n\nAction at T=86: U, y_{87} = 3\n\nAction at T=87: U, y_{88} = 4\n\nAction at T=88: U, y_{89} = 5\n\nAction at T=89: U, y_{90} = 6\n\nAction at T=90: U, y_{91} = 7\n\nAction at T=91: U, y_{92} = 8\n\nAction at T=92: U, y_{93} = 9\n\nAt T=93, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions from T=82 to T=92, that's 11 actions? T=82 to T=92 inclusive is 11 turns, but we reach y=9 at T=93 after last action.\n\nThe sequence of actions: actions at t = t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, position at t1+H should be (0,9).\n\nt1=82.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1+H, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, actions from T=82 to T=92, that's t=0 to t=10? Set t=0 for t1.\n\nt1=82, so actions at τ=0 to τ=H-1.\n\nAfter action at τ=H-1, position at τ=H.\n\nPosition at turn t1 + H should be (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence above, we have actions at T=82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92 (which is τ=0 to 10, 11 actions), and position at T=93 (τ=11) is y=9.\n\nT=93 = t1 + 11, since t1=82, 82+11=93.\n\nH=11? Actions from τ=0 to τ=H-1, so if H actions, last action at τ=H-1, position at τ=H.\n\nSet position at time τ: y(τ)\n\nAt τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter action at τ=0, position at τ=1, and so on.\n\nWe need y(H) =9.\n\nNumber of actions: from τ=0 to τ=H-1, H actions.\n\nIn the path: we stayed at y=0 for τ=0 and τ=1, so y(0)=0, y(1)=0 (after actions at τ=0 and τ=1)\n\nThen action at τ=2: U, so y(3)=1? Let's index properly.\n\nAt time τ, position y(τ).\n\nAction a(τ) taken at time τ, determines y(τ+1).\n\ny(τ+1) = y(τ) + Δy(τ)\n\nWith Δy from action.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt τ=0: y(0)=0, action S, so y(1)=0\n\nτ=1: y(1)=0, action S, so y(2)=0\n\nτ=2: y(2)=0, action U, so y(3)=1\n\nτ=3: y(3)=1, action U, so y(4)=2\n\nτ=4: y(4)=2, action U, so y(5)=3\n\nτ=5: y(5)=3, action U, so y(6)=4\n\nτ=6: y(6)=4, action U, so y(7)=5\n\nτ=7: y(7)=5, action U, so y(8)=6\n\nτ=8: y(8)=6, action U, so y(9)=7\n\nτ=9: y(9)=7, action U, so y(10)=8\n\nτ=10: y(10)=8, action U, so y(11)=9\n\nSo at τ=11, y=9.\n\nWe have actions from τ=0 to τ=10, that's 11 actions, H=11.\n\nBut is this minimal? We wasted two turns at y=0.\n\nPerhaps we can go up faster or avoid waiting.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 and y=7 are always safe, we could go to them earlier.\n\nBut we start from y=0.\n\nAt τ=0, we can go to y=1 immediately.\n\nAt τ=0, T=82, y=0, action U, so y(1)=1 at τ=1.\n\nNow at τ=1, y=1, which is safe.\n\nNow, we cannot go up to y=2 at τ=2 because y=2 would be at τ=2, unsafe.\n\nBut at τ=1, y=1, we could go down to y=0, but that seems worse.\n\nOr stay at y=1.\n\nIf at τ=1, y=1, action S, then y(2)=1, but at τ=2, y=1 unsafe, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAction D, to y(2)=0, then at τ=2, y=0 safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up later.\n\nFor example:\n\nτ=0: y=0, U → y(1)=1\n\nτ=1: y=1, D → y(2)=0  (back to y=0)\n\nτ=2: y=0, U → y(3)=1\n\nNow at τ=3, y=1, safe.\n\nThen go up: U to y(4)=2, safe since τ=4>2\n\nU to y(5)=3, U to y(6)=4, U to y(7)=5, U to y(8)=6, U to y(9)=7, U to y(10)=8, U to y(11)=9\n\nSame as before, 11 actions: from τ=0 to τ=10, y(11)=9.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut we have an extra move down and up, same as waiting.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly to higher y faster, but we can only move one step per turn.\n\nAnother idea: since y=8 is unsafe at τ=0 and τ=1, but we can be there after τ=1.\n\nIn the direct path with waiting, we reach y=8 at τ=10, which is fine.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we go up immediately but skip the unsafe point.\n\nThe unsafe point is only at τ=2 for y=1-5.\n\nSo if we can be on y=1 before τ=2 or after.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1 is safe, but if we go to y=2 at τ=2, unsafe.\n\nBut we cannot jump to y=3.\n\nUnless we stay at some safe y.\n\ny=0 is safe, but not freeway.\n\nOr y=6,7 safe, but far.\n\nMinimal time: we need to be at y=9 at some H.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=1 is τ=1, by going U at τ=0.\n\nBut then at τ=1, y=1, if we go U, to y=2 at τ=2, unsafe.\n\nIf we go to y=1 at τ=1, and we could go to y=6 or something, but we have to go through intermediate.\n\nPerhaps we can go up to y=5 quickly but avoid τ=2.\n\nBut to reach y=5, we need at least 5 steps up from y=0.\n\nIf we start at τ=0, go U to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=1, we cannot go U to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nIf we go S or D, we delay.\n\nSuppose at τ=1, y=1, we go D to y=0 at τ=2.\n\nBut at τ=2, y=0 safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=0, go U to y=1 at τ=3.\n\nThen y=1 at τ=3 safe.\n\nThen go up each step to y=5 at τ=7, for example.\n\ny(3)=1, U to y(4)=2, U to y(5)=3, U to y(6)=4, U to y(7)=5.\n\ny(7)=5 at τ=7.\n\nThen to y=6 at τ=8, y=7 at τ=9, y=8 at τ=10, y=9 at τ=11.\n\nSame as before.\n\nFrom y=1 at τ=3, go up to y=2 at τ=4, etc., to y=5 at τ=7, then to y=6 at τ=8, y=7 at τ=9, y=8 at τ=10, y=9 at τ=11.\n\nBut y=6 and y=7 are safe, so from y=5 at τ=7, we can go directly to them.\n\nBut no faster.\n\nPerhaps start later.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 and y=7 are always safe, we can go to them at any time, including early.\n\nBut to go to y=6, we need to be at y=5 or y=7 first, etc.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, y=0, go U to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, instead of going up, we could stay, but unsafe at τ=2.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo down to y=0 at τ=2, then from there go up.\n\nBut same as before.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=8 after τ=1.\n\ny=8 is unsafe at τ=0 and τ=1, so we can be on y=8 only from τ=2 onwards.\n\nIn the path, we reach y=8 at τ=10 in the sequence.\n\nCan we reach y=8 earlier?\n\nFor example, if we go up continuously from earlier time.\n\nSuppose we start at τ=0, go U to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nThen we need to not be on y=1-5 at τ=2.\n\nBut at τ=1, we are at y=1, if we do nothing, at τ=2 y=1 unsafe.\n\nIf we go down, to y=0 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=0, go U to y=1 at τ=3.\n\nThen from τ=3, go up to y=2 at τ=4, y=3 at τ=5, y=4 at τ=6, y=5 at τ=7, y=6 at τ=8, y=7 at τ=9, y=8 at τ=10, y=9 at τ=11.\n\nSame.\n\nFrom y=1 at τ=1, we could go up to y=2, but not possible because at τ=2 it would be unsafe.\n\nUnless we can be at a safe y at τ=2.\n\ny=6 or y=7 are safe, but we are at y=1 at τ=1, too far.\n\ny=0 is safe, but not helpful.\n\nSo it seems we must avoid being on y=1-5 at τ=2, which means we cannot be on those y at turn T=84.\n\nIn the sequence, we are at y=0 at τ=2, which is safe.\n\nThen we go up.\n\nBut we have to go through y=1 to y=5, each taking one turn, so from y=0 at τ=2, we go to y=1 at τ=3, y=2 at τ=4, ..., y=5 at τ=7, then to y=6 at τ=8, y=7 at τ=9, y=8 at τ=10, y=9 at τ=11.\n\ny=5 to y=6 at τ=8, etc.\n\nNow, from y=5 to y=9, that's 4 steps, from τ=7 to τ=11, but we start from y=0 at τ=2.\n\ny(2)=0, y(3)=1, y(4)=2, y(5)=3, y(6)=4, y(7)=5, y(8)=6, y(9)=7, y(10)=8, y(11)=9.\n\nSo positions from τ=2 to τ=11, 10 steps? τ from 2 to 11 is 10 time points, but actions from τ=2 to τ=10.\n\nWe need to include from τ=0.\n\nIn terms of actions: to have y(2)=0, we need actions at τ=0 and τ=1 both S or something.\n\nEarlier we had actions at τ=0: S, y(1)=0\n\nτ=1: S, y(2)=0\n\nThen τ=2: U, y(3)=1\n\n...\n\nUp to τ=10: U, y(11)=9\n\nSo actions from τ=0 to τ=10, 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut is there a way with less?\n\nSuppose we go up to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=1, instead of going down, we go up, but to y=2 at τ=2, unsafe, not possible.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=6 directly, but no, we can only move one step.\n\nAnother idea: since y=8 is safe from τ=2, we can be on it early.\n\nBut to reach y=8, we need to come from y=7 or y=9, but y=9 not yet.\n\ny=7 is always safe.\n\nSo if we can reach y=7 early.\n\nBut to reach y=7, we need to go through y=6, etc.\n\nThe fastest to reach a high y.\n\nFor example, to be at y=5 at some time.\n\nEarliest at τ=5: if we go up each turn from τ=0: y(1)=1, y(2)=2, but at τ=2 y=2 unsafe, not possible.\n\nIf we start later: at τ=0, S, y(1)=0\n\nThen at τ=1, U, y(2)=1, but at τ=2 y=1 unsafe, not possible.\n\nAt τ=0, S, y(1)=0\n\nτ=1, S, y(2)=0\n\nτ=2, U, y(3)=1\n\nThen y(4)=2, y(5)=3, y(6)=4, y(7)=5 at τ=7, same as before.\n\nThen y(8)=6, y(9)=7, y(10)=8, y(11)=9.\n\ny(7)=5 at τ=7, then to y=6 at τ=8, etc.\n\nBut y=6 at τ=8 is fine.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=8 earlier if we go faster, but we can't.\n\nSince y=6 and y=7 are safe, we could stay there if needed, but no need.\n\nIn this case, H=11 seems necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on y=8.\n\ny=8 has a car that is unsafe at τ=0 and τ=1, but we are at y=8 at τ=10, fine.\n\nIn the sequence, at τ=10, y=8, which is τ=10, safe.\n\nThen we go to y=9.\n\nBut can we reach y=9 faster?\n\nFor example, if we go to y=8 at an earlier time when it is safe.\n\ny=8 safe from τ=2 onwards.\n\nSo earliest we can be at y=8 is, say, if we go up continuously from some point.\n\nBut to reach y=8 from y=0, need 8 steps.\n\nIf we start going up at τ=0 to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nBut then we stuck at τ=2.\n\nIf we start going up at τ=2 from y=0.\n\ny(2)=0, U to y(3)=1, U to y(4)=2, ..., to y(10)=8 at τ=10, same as before.\n\ny(10)=8, then to y(11)=9.\n\nNo earlier.\n\nIf we could be at y=5 at τ=2, but we can't, because to be at y=5, we need to have started earlier and gone up, but at τ=2 it would be unsafe for y=5.\n\nFor example, if we were at y=4 at τ=1, but at τ=1, if y=4, let's see if possible.\n\nTo be at y=4 at τ=1: that would require y(1)=4.\n\nBut from y(0)=0, we need to go up 4 steps in one turn, impossible, only one step per turn.\n\nSo earliest to be at y=k is τ=k.\n\nThus at τ=2, we can be at y=0,1,2.\n\nBut y=1 and y=2 are unsafe at τ=2, so only safe at y=0 or possibly other, but y=0 is the only option at τ=2.\n\ny=3,4,5 also unsafe at τ=2, and we can't be at y=3,4,5 at τ=2 because it takes at least 3,4,5 steps.\n\nFor example, to be at y=3 at τ=2: y(2)=3, which requires actions: from y(0)=0, at τ=0 U to y(1)=1, τ=1 U to y(2)=2, not 3. Cannot be at y=3 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, only possible positions at τ=2 are y=0,1,2.\n\ny=0 safe, y=1 unsafe, y=2 unsafe.\n\nSo only safe position at τ=2 is y=0.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=0 at τ=2.\n\nThen from there, we go up to y=1 at τ=3, and so on to y=9 at τ=11.\n\nThus minimal H is 11.\n\nActions: to be at y=0 at τ=2, we need:\n\nAt τ=0: y(0)=0, action must be S to have y(1)=0 (since U would go to y=1)\n\nAt τ=1: y(1)=0, action S to have y(2)=0\n\nThen at τ=2: y(2)=0, action U to y(3)=1\n\nThen U each step to y(11)=9.\n\nNow, the actions are at τ=0 to τ=10.\n\nτ=0: S\n\nτ=1: S\n\nτ=2: U\n\nτ=3: U (to y=2)\n\nτ=4: U (to y=3)\n\nτ=5: U (to y=4)\n\nτ=6: U (to y=5)\n\nτ=7: U (to y=6)\n\nτ=8: U (to y=7)\n\nτ=9: U (to y=8)\n\nτ=10: U (to y=9)\n\nAt τ=10, action U, y(11)=9.\n\nNow, at which points are we on freeway and need to check collision.\n\nAt τ=3, y=1, T=85, τ=3, safe as before.\n\nτ=4, y=2, τ=4, safe since unsafe only τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, τ=5, y=3, τ=5>2, safe.\n\nτ=6, y=4, safe.\n\nτ=7, y=5, safe.\n\nτ=8, y=6, always safe.\n\nτ=9, y=7, always safe.\n\nτ=10, y=8, τ=10, safe since unsafe only τ=0,1.\n\nThen at τ=11, y=9, not freeway.\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, H=11 actions, from t=82 to t=92.\n\nt1=82, actions at t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nH=11, so t from 0 to 10.\n\nAction at turn: t1 + 0 =82, S\n\nt1 +1 =83, S\n\nt1 +2 =84, U\n\nt1 +3 =85, U\n\n...\n\nUp to t1 +10 =92, U\n\nThen position at t1 + H =82 +11=93, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, after action at t=92, position at t=93 is y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to list the actions for each turn.\n\nNow, for the U actions, from t=84 to t=92, that's many U, but we need to specify.\n\nIn the freeways, for y=6,7,8, we need to ensure safety.\n\ny=6 and y=7 always safe, no issue.\n\ny=8: at τ=10, which is T=92, t1=82, τ=10.\n\ny=8 unsafe at τ=0 and τ=1, but τ=10>1, safe.\n\nThe car spans: second car on y=8 at τ=10: span [-11 + 6*10, 6*10] = [-11+60, 60] = [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nFirst car also not, so safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nNow, but in the action sequence, from t=85 to t=92, we have U each time, but at different y, but actions are U, so y increases.\n\nt=84: U, to y=1 at t=85\n\nt=85: U, to y=2 at t=86\n\netc.\n\nIn terms of the answer format.\n\nBut H=11, but is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose we go to y=1 at τ=1, then at τ=1, y=1, we go down to y=0 at τ=2, same as before.\n\nOr, another idea: can we be at y=8 at τ=2?\n\nBut y=8 at τ=2 is safe, since unsafe only τ=0,1.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at τ=2, we need y(2)=8.\n\nBut from y(0)=0, in two steps: at τ=0 U to y(1)=1, τ=1 U to y(2)=2, not 8. Impossible.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nEarliest at y=8 is τ=8, if we go up continuously from τ=0, but we can't because of τ=2 issue.\n\nWith waiting, we reach y=8 at τ=10.\n\nPerhaps we can go up to y=6 faster, but y=6 at τ=6, for example, but to be at y=6 at τ=6, need to go from y=0 to y=6 in 6 steps, but during that, at τ=2 we would be at y=2, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo indeed, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's confirm the number.\n\nStart: t=82, y=0\n\nAction S: t=83, y=0\n\nAction S: t=84, y=0\n\nAction U: t=85, y=1\n\nAction U: t=86, y=2\n\nAction U: t=87, y=3\n\nAction U: t=88, y=4\n\nAction U: t=89, y=5\n\nAction U: t=90, y=6\n\nAction U: t=91, y=7\n\nAction U: t=92, y=8\n\nAction U: t=93, y=9\n\nActions from t=82 to t=92, 11 actions.\n\nt=82 to t=92 inclusive is 11 turns.\n\nThe sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=82, H=11, so turns 82 to 92.\n\nNow, in the answer, we need to list:\n\nTurn 82: S\n\nTurn 83: S\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nBut from turn 85 to 92, all U, but we can write it as such.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter path by going to y=9 directly, but no.\n\nAnother thought: at y=0, we can only go to y=1, but we have to avoid the collision time.\n\nSince y=8 is safe from τ=2, and we can be there, but we need to reach it.\n\nPerhaps we can go down from higher, but not necessary.\n\nI think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut in the beginning, at τ=0, we did S, but we could have done U to y=1 at τ=1, then D to y=0 at τ=2, same as S S.\n\nBut with one more action? No.\n\nIf at τ=0 U, to y=1 at τ=1\n\nThen at τ=1 D, to y=0 at τ=2\n\nThen same as before from there.\n\nBut we used two actions to go from y=0 to y=1 and back, whereas with S S, we stay at y=0 with two actions.\n\nSame number of actions to reach y=0 at τ=2.\n\nThen from there same.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nThus the sequence above is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to write the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, from turn 84 to 92, all actions are U, but we have to specify each turn.\n\nIn the format, we list each turn action.\n\nBut perhaps we can write it clearly.\n\nSince multiple U, but it's fine.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 8, there is a car at (0,-11,right,6), which at τ=0 and τ=1 covers 0, but we are on y=8 only at τ=10, fine.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo minimal H=11.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but in the answer, we need to provide the sequence.\n\nPerhaps there is a way with H=10.\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at τ=10.\n\nThen y(10)=9.\n\nTo have y(10)=9, since y(0)=0, we need exactly 9 up actions and possibly some S or D, but S or D don't change y, so to increase y by 9, we need at least 9 up actions, and if there are S or D, H increases.\n\nWith H actions, the net change must be +9, so number of U minus number of D must be 9.\n\nEach U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\nSo let U be number of U, D number of D, S number of S.\n\nThen U - D =9\n\nU + D + S = H\n\nAlso, y must stay within [0,9].\n\nIn this case, with no D, U=9, S=H-9.\n\nBut H >=9.\n\nWith H=10, U - D =9, and U + D + S=10.\n\nSince U - D =9, and U + D <=10, so (U - D) + 2D =9 + 2D <=10, so 2D <=1, D=0 since integer.\n\nThen U=9, S=1.\n\nSo possible: 9 U and 1 S.\n\nNow, with one S, we need to place the S somewhere to avoid the unsafe point.\n\nFor example, start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nIf we do S at some point.\n\nBut we need to not be on y=1-5 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, we must be at y=0 or y=6 or higher, but y=6 at τ=2 impossible, since y<=2 at τ=2 if we go up.\n\nPossible positions at τ=2: y=0,1,2.\n\nIf we are at y=0 at τ=2, safe.\n\nThen we can go up from there.\n\nBut to be at y=0 at τ=2, we need to have done S or D at τ=0 or τ=1.\n\nFor example:\n\nOption: at τ=0: S, so y(1)=0\n\nτ=1: U, but if U, y(2)=1, but at τ=2 y=1 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt τ=0: U, y(1)=1\n\nτ=1: S, then y(2)=1, unsafe.\n\nτ=1: D, y(2)=0, safe.\n\nThen at τ=2: y=0, then we need to go to y=9 in 8 more actions? From τ=2 to τ=10.\n\nH=10 actions, from τ=0 to τ=9.\n\ny(10)=9.\n\nNow, at τ=2, y=0.\n\nWe need y(10)=9, so from y=0 at τ=2 to y=9 at τ=10, that is 8 steps later.\n\ny(10) - y(2) =9 -0=9, but in 8 steps? From time τ=2 to τ=10, there are 8 actions (τ=2 to τ=9) to determine y(3) to y(10).\n\ny(2)=0\n\nAfter 8 actions, y(10).\n\nThe change in y from τ=2 to τ=10 depends on actions from τ=2 to τ=9.\n\nLet k = τ - 2, so at k=0, y=0.\n\nActions at k=0 to 7, determine y(1) to y(8) in k terms, but y at k=8.\n\nSet: at step k=0 (τ=2), position y=0.\n\nActions a(k) for k=0 to 7 (τ=2 to 9), determine y at k+1.\n\ny(1) to y(8) for k.\n\ny at k=8 is position at τ=10.\n\nWe need y(k=8) =9.\n\nFrom y(k=0)=0, to y(k=8)=9, so net +9 in 8 actions.\n\nThus U - D =9, U + D + S =8.\n\nThen U - D =9, U + D <=8, impossible since U - D =9 implies U >=9, U + D >=9 >8.\n\nContradiction.\n\nThus impossible to have y(10)=9 with y(2)=0 in 8 actions.\n\nBecause 8 actions can change y by at most 8, but we need +9, impossible.\n\nTherefore, with H=10, y(10)=9, but y(0)=0, so net +9, with 10 actions, possible only if U=9, D=0, S=1, as before.\n\nBut to have U=9 and S=1, we need to place the S.\n\nNow, with y(0)=0.\n\nActions: one S and nine U, but H=10 actions, so positions y(1) to y(10).\n\ny(10)=9.\n\nThe S must be placed such that at τ=2, we are not on unsafe y.\n\nBut possible positions at τ=2: y(2).\n\ny(2) depends on actions at τ=0 and τ=1.\n\nIf at τ=0: U, y(1)=1\n\nτ=1: if U, y(2)=2, unsafe\n\nIf S, y(2)=1, unsafe\n\nIf D, y(2)=0, safe\n\nThen at τ=2, y=0.\n\nThen from τ=2 to τ=10, we have 8 actions to go from y=0 to y=9, but need +9 in 8 actions, impossible, as above.\n\nIf at τ=0: S, y(1)=0\n\nThen at τ=1: if U, y(2)=1, unsafe\n\nIf S, y(2)=0, safe\n\nThen at τ=2, y=0.\n\nThen same, from y=0 at τ=2, need to reach y=9 at τ=10 with 8 actions, impossible.\n\nIf at τ=1 we do something else, but from y(1)=0, actions U, S, or D.\n\nD to y= -1, invalid, not possible.\n\nSo only U or S.\n\nBoth lead to y(2)=1 or 0, and if y(2)=0, then cannot reach y=9 at τ=10.\n\nTherefore, impossible with H=10.\n\nSimilarly for less.\n\nThus minimal H=11.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 82: S\n\nTurn 83: S\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U  (to y=2 at t=86? Let's list position to verify)\n\nAt turn t=82, position y=0, action S, so next position y=0 at t=83.\n\nTurn t=83, position y=0, action S, so y=0 at t=84.\n\nTurn t=84, position y=0, action U, so y=1 at t=85.\n\nTurn t=85, position y=1, action U, so y=2 at t=86.\n\nTurn t=86, position y=2, action U, so y=3 at t=87.\n\nTurn t=87, position y=3, action U, so y=4 at t=88.\n\nTurn t=88, position y=4, action U, so y=5 at t=89.\n\nTurn t=89, position y=5, action U, so y=6 at t=90.\n\nTurn t=90, position y=6, action U, so y=7 at t=91.\n\nTurn t=91, position y=7, action U, so y=8 at t=92.\n\nTurn t=92, position y=8, action U, so y=9 at t=93.\n\nAll safe as checked.\n\nNow, actions from turn 82 to 92.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t=85 to t=92, all actions are U, but we need to list them.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 82: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 83: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 84: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 89: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 90: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 91: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 92: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut to write it in text.\n\nSince the problem says \"a sequence of actions\", and list in the box.\n\nPerhaps we can write:\n\nTurn 82: S\n\nTurn 83: S\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\n...\n\nBut in the box, I think we list each.\n\nSince from 84 to 92 all U, but we specify.\n\nIn the freeway, for y=3,4,5, there are multiple cars, but we are there after τ=2, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nI think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 82\\) is 11. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by waiting at \\(y = 0\\) until after the unsafe turn \\(T = 84\\) (relative turn \\(\\tau = 2\\)), when freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\) are unsafe due to car spans covering position \\(x = 0\\). Freeway \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe at turns \\(T = 82\\) and \\(T = 83\\) (\\(\\tau = 0\\) and \\(\\tau = 1\\)), but safe thereafter. Freeways \\(y = 6\\) and \\(y = 7\\) are always safe.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- At turn 82, stay (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 0\\), avoiding the unsafe state on \\(y = 8\\) at \\(\\tau = 0\\).\n- At turn 83, stay (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 0\\), avoiding the unsafe state on \\(y = 8\\) at \\(\\tau = 1\\) and preparing to move after \\(\\tau = 2\\).\n- At turn 84, move up (\\(U\\)) to reach \\(y = 1\\) at turn 85. Since \\(\\tau = 3\\) at turn 85, \\(y = 1\\) is safe.\n- From turns 85 to 92, move up (\\(U\\)) each turn to increment \\(y\\) by 1 per turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 93. All positions during these turns are safe:\n  - Turns 85 to 89 (\\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\)): Safe because \\(\\tau \\geq 3 > 2\\).\n  - Turns 90 and 91 (\\(y = 6\\) and \\(y = 7\\)): Always safe.\n  - Turn 92 (\\(y = 8\\)): Safe because \\(\\tau = 10 > 1\\).\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y = 9\\) at turn 93 (\\(t_1 + H = 82 + 11\\)) with \\(H = 11\\) actions, which is minimal due to the need to avoid the unsafe turn \\(T = 84\\) and the impossibility of reaching \\(y = 9\\) in fewer than 11 turns while satisfying the constraints.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 82: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 83: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 84: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 89: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 90: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 91: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 92: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t=86, and I start at y=0.\n\nThe player moves each turn with actions U (up, y increases by 1), D (down, y decreases by 1), or S (stay, y stays the same). y must stay between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway y=1 to y=8, and they move left or right with given speeds. Collision happens only if at the turn when I'm on a freeway, the car's span includes position x=0 at that exact turn.\n\nImportantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1. So for collision, it's based on where I am at the beginning of the turn before moving.\n\nLet me denote the turn number. At turn t, I am at position y_t. I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen, for collision: at turn T, I am at y_T. If y_T is between 1 and 8, I need to check if there is a car on freeway y_T such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn T.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t=86, and I need to compute where they are at future turns.\n\nThe car update: for a car, at turn t_1=86, it has head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nIf left-moving, span at time T is [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nAnd collision if 0 is in that interval at turn T when I'm on that row.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars there. y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is the starting point, and y=9 is the goal, both have no cars.\n\nI start at y=0 at turn 86.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to get to y=9 as quickly as possible, min H, where at turn t_1 + H - 1, y = 9.\n\nLet me set t_1 = 86.\n\nSo at turn 86, y=0.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn 86 + H, y should be 9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, after action, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nStart: turn 86, y=0.\n\nI perform action a_86, then at turn 87, y = y_86 + Δy based on a_86.\n\nSimilarly, a_87, at turn 88, y=y_87 + Δy, and so on.\n\nI reach y=9 at some turn T, meaning that at turn T, y_T = 9.\n\nSince I start at turn 86 with y=0, and I want y_T = 9 for some T.\n\nThe number of actions is the number of turns from start to when I arrive at y=9.\n\nLet’s say I take actions from turn 86 to turn 86 + H - 1, so H actions, and at turn 86 + H, y = 9? No.\n\nDefine carefully.\n\nAt time t, before action, position is y_t.\n\nI take action a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nSo after H actions, I have set y_{t+1} to y_{t+H}.\n\nI start at t=86 with y_86 given.\n\nAfter a_86, y_87 is set.\n\nAfter a_87, y_88 is set, ..., after a_{86+H-1}, y_{86+H} is set.\n\nI want y_{86+H} = 9.\n\nAnd H is the number of turns, min H.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=86 to t=86+H-1.\n\nFor example, if I do nothing, y stays, but I need to move to 9.\n\nMinimal H: since I need to go from 0 to 9, with moves of +1,0,-1, the minimal steps would be 9 up moves, but I have to avoid cars, so it might take more if I have to wait or detour.\n\nBut I can only move vertically, not horizontally, so I have to go through each row, but I can skip rows by moving multiple steps, but each action changes y by at most 1, so I have to visit each y from 0 to 9, but not necessarily, because I can go up and down, so I might not visit all, but to go from 0 to 9, with steps of +1,0,-1, the minimal number of moves is at least 9, if I only go up.\n\nBut due to cars, I might need to stay or go down sometimes, so H >=9.\n\nNow, I need to check for each row and each turn if it's safe to be there.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions over time.\n\nCurrent turn t_1 = 86.\n\nFor each freeway k from 1 to 8, there are cars with (h, τ, d, s) at t=86.\n\nLet me list them:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nSince left-moving, at time T, span is [h - s(T-86), τ - s(T-86)] = [48 - 36(T-86), 83 - 36(T-86)]\n\nSimilarly, Freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (48,83,left,36) — identical to freeway 1.\n\nIs that right? Let me check the table.\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\n| 1 | (48, 83, left, 36) |\n\n| 2 | (48, 83, left, 36) | — same as 1\n\n| 3 | (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) |\n\n| 4 | (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) | — same as 3\n\n| 5 | same as 3 and 4? (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) — yes\n\n| 6 | (48,37,right,6) | only one car\n\n| 7 | (48,37,right,6) | same as 6\n\n| 8 | (48,37,right,6), (0,-11,right,6) | two cars\n\nFreeways 1 and 2 are identical, 3,4,5 are identical, 6 and 7 are identical, and 8 has an extra car.\n\nFor collision, I need to check at turn T if for the row y_T, 0 is in any car's span on that row.\n\nNow, since the cars move, the spans change over time.\n\nI need to find when each freeway has a car where 0 is in the span at time T.\n\nFor a given freeway k and time T, I need to know if there is a car on k such that 0 ∈ [low, high] for the span at T.\n\nFor left-moving car: span [h - s(T-86), τ - s(T-86)] but since left-moving, h is head, τ tail, so if d=left, head > tail? Let's see the span.\n\nIn the update, for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ], and at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] I think? No.\n\nLook: for right-moving, it says: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the car update rules:\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIf h and τ, and it's moving left, so if h > τ, then [h, τ] might be decreasing, but usually we think low to high.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (48,83,left,36) — head 48, tail 83? That seems odd because 48 < 83, but if moving left, head should be on the left? I think there might be confusion in notation.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nIt says: \"for car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t1\"\n\nAnd for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\"\n\nBut in the example, for freeway 1, (48,83,left,36), so h=48, τ=83, so [48,83], and since left-moving, at time T, it becomes [48 - 36(T-86), 83 - 36(T-86)]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like freeway 3, (48,37,right,12), so h=48, τ=37? It says (head h, tail τ), so for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h]? No.\n\nIn the text: \"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nFor freeway 3, first car: (48,37,right,12), so h=48, τ=37, and since right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [37,48], and at T, [37 + 12(T-86), 48 + 12(T-86)]\n\nSimilarly, the second car: (12,1,right,12), span(t1) = [1,12], at T [1 + 12(T-86), 12 + 12(T-86)]\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12), span(t1) = [-35,-24], at T [-35 + 12(T-86), -24 + 12(T-86)]\n\nNow for left-moving, freeway 1: (48,83,left,36), span(t1) = [48,83], at T [48 - 36(T-86), 83 - 36(T-86)]\n\nSince it's moving left, the positions decrease.\n\nNow, collision at turn T if I am on freeway k (y_T = k) and for some car on k, 0 is in the span at T, meaning low <= 0 <= high for that car's span at T.\n\nAlso, note that at y=0 and y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nI start at y=0 at turn 86, so at turn 86, I am on y=0, which is safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nSince I have to go through rows 1 to 8, and each has cars, I need to find times when for a given row, 0 is not covered by any car at that time.\n\nFor each row, I can find the times when it is safe to be there, i.e., no car has 0 in span.\n\nThen I need a path from y=0 to y=9, changing y by -1,0,+1 each turn, with the constraint that for each turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, it must be safe at T.\n\ny_T is the position at turn T, before action, but when we check collision, it's at turn T for position y_T.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, and I choose a_t, then move to y_{T+1}.\n\nBut the collision check is based on y_T at turn T for the cars at turn T.\n\nSo for safety, when I am at y_T at turn T, if y_T in 1-8, it must be that no car on row y_T has 0 in span at turn T.\n\nNow, since the cars move continuously, I need to compute for each row the set of times when it is safe.\n\nLet me define for each freeway k, the set of times T where it is unsafe, i.e., there is a car with 0 in span at T.\n\nThen safe times are when no such car.\n\nT is discrete, turns.\n\nt_1 = 86.\n\nFirst, let's handle each freeway separately.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, left-moving: span at T: [48 - 36(T-86), 83 - 36(T-86)]\n\n0 in span if 48 - 36(T-86) <= 0 <= 83 - 36(T-86)\n\nSimilarly, since it's a interval, we can solve for T.\n\nLet Δt = T - 86, so T = 86 + Δt\n\nThen for freeway 1 car: low = 48 - 36 Δt, high = 83 - 36 Δt\n\n0 in [low, high] if low <= 0 and 0 <= high, so 48 - 36 Δt <= 0 and 0 <= 83 - 36 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36 Δt <= 0 => 48 <= 36 Δt => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so since Δt integer, Δt >= 2\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 83 - 36 Δt => 36 Δt <= 83 => Δt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so Δt <= 2\n\nΔt <= 2 and Δt >= 2, so Δt = 2\n\nThus, unsafe only at Δt=2, i.e., T=88\n\nFor other Δt, safe.\n\nΔt=2, T=86+2=88\n\nNow, for freeway 2: same as freeway 1, since same car parameters, so also unsafe only at T=88.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) — this is right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [37 + 12 Δt, 48 + 12 Δt] since τ=37, h=48, s=12\n\n0 in span if 37 + 12 Δt <= 0 <= 48 + 12 Δt\n\nBut 37 + 12 Δt <= 0? Since Δt >=0, 37+12Δt >=37>0, so 37+12Δt <=0 is false. Thus 0 not in span for this car, for any Δt.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 48+12Δt always true, but since low >0, 0 not in [low,high].\n\nlow =37+12Δt >=37>0, high=48+12Δt>0, so 0 < low <= high, so 0 not in interval.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,12), span at T: [1 + 12 Δt, 12 + 12 Δt]\n\nlow =1 +12Δt >=1>0, high=12+12Δt>0, so 0 not in interval.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12), but span at t1: [τ, h] = [-35,-24] since τ=-35, h=-24? Head and tail.\n\nGiven (-24,-35,right,12), so h=-24, τ=-35? But in notation, head h, tail τ.\n\nFor right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nAt T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-35 + 12 Δt, -24 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 12 Δt <= 0 <= -24 + 12 Δt\n\nFirst, -35 + 12 Δt <= 0 => 12 Δt <= 35 => Δt <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so Δt <= 2\n\nSecond, 0 <= -24 + 12 Δt => 24 <= 12 Δt => Δt >= 24/12 = 2\n\nSo Δt >=2 and Δt <=2, so Δt=2, T=88\n\nThus for freeway 3, only the third car makes it unsafe at T=88, and others are always safe or not covering 0.\n\nSo unsafe at T=88.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 and 5 are same as freeway 3, so unsafe at T=88.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car (48,37,right,6)\n\nRight-moving, so span at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [37 + 6 Δt, 48 + 6 Δt]\n\nlow=37+6Δt >=37>0, high=48+6Δt>0, so 0 not in interval, always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: same as 6, (48,37,right,6), always safe.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6), same as above, always safe, since low>0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6)\n\nSo h=0, τ=-11, right-moving.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-11 + 6 Δt, 0 + 6 Δt] = [-11 + 6 Δt, 6 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 6 Δt <= 0 <= 6 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -11 + 6 Δt <= 0 => 6 Δt <= 11 => Δt <= 11/6 ≈ 1.833, so Δt <= 1\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 6 Δt => Δt >= 0\n\nSo for Δt >=0 and Δt <=1, i.e., Δt=0 or 1, T=86 or 87\n\nThus unsafe at T=86 and T=87.\n\nNow, summary for each freeway when unsafe:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=88\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=88\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe at T=88\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe at T=88\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at T=88\n\nFreeway 6: always safe\n\nFreeway 7: always safe\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=86 and T=87\n\nAlso, freeway 8 is unsafe at T=86 and 87, but at other times, since the first car is safe, and second car only at T=86,87.\n\nFor freeway 8, at T=86 and 87, unsafe because of second car.\n\nAt T=88, for example: second car span at T=88: Δt=2, low = -11 + 6*2 = -11+12=1, high=6*2=12, so [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for other T.\n\nNow, freeway 6 and 7 always safe.\n\nBut we need to be on the freeway at that turn.\n\nNow, I start at turn 86, y=0, which is safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe unsafe times: for row 1 to 8:\n\nRow 1: unsafe only at T=88\n\nRow 2: unsafe at T=88\n\nRow 3: unsafe at T=88\n\nRow 4: unsafe at T=88\n\nRow 5: unsafe at T=88\n\nRow 6: always safe\n\nRow 7: always safe\n\nRow 8: unsafe at T=86 and T=87, but safe at T=88 and later.\n\nRow 8 unsafe at T=86 and 87.\n\nNow, since I start at turn 86, y=0.\n\nIf I want to go to row 1, I need to be on row 1 at some turn T, and it must be safe, so not T=88.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut row 1 is only unsafe at T=88, so I can be on row 1 at other times, like T=87 or T=89, etc.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 is unsafe at T=86 and 87, so I can be on row 8 at T=88 or later.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on a row when it is unsafe.\n\nAt turn 86, I am at y=0.\n\nI can choose to go up to y=1 at turn 87, or stay, or down, but down to y=0, same.\n\nSince y=0 is safe, but I need to move up.\n\nNow, if I go up at turn 86, action U, then at turn 87, y=1.\n\nBut at turn 87, if y=1, is row 1 safe at T=87?\n\nRow 1 unsafe only at T=88, so at T=87, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 at T=87 is unsafe, but I'm not on row 8 yet.\n\nLet me plan the path.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe minimal H: if no cars, I can go up every turn, from turn 86 to 94, y from 0 to 9 in 9 moves: actions at t=86 to 94, y_{87} to y_{95}? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn 86: y=0\n\nAction a_86: if U, y_87 =1\n\na_87: U, y_88=2\n\n...\n\na_94: U, y_95=9\n\nSo after 9 actions, at turn 95, y=9.\n\nH=9 turns? Actions from t=86 to t=94, that's 9 actions, y_{87} to y_{95}, with y_{95}=9.\n\nNumber of actions H=9.\n\nBut with cars, I might need more if I have to wait.\n\nCan I do it in 9 turns?\n\nLet me see if I can go directly up without stopping.\n\nStart: t=86, y=0, safe.\n\nAction: U, so move to y=1 at t=87.\n\nAt t=87, y=1, which is row 1. Is it safe? Row 1 unsafe only at t=88, so at t=87, safe. So no collision.\n\nThen action U at t=87, to y=2 at t=88.\n\nAt t=88, y=2, row 2. But row 2 is unsafe at t=88! Freeway 2 unsafe at t=88.\n\nSo if I am on row 2 at t=88, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf I go up at t=87 to y=2 at t=88, but at t=88 I am on y=2, and row 2 is unsafe, so collision.\n\nSo I cannot be on row 2 at t=88.\n\nSimilarly, if I try to be on any row from 1 to 5 at t=88, it is unsafe, since rows 1-5 all unsafe at t=88.\n\nRow 1 to 5 unsafe at t=88.\n\nRows 6 and 7 always safe, row 8 unsafe at t=86 and 87.\n\nIn the direct path, at t=88, I would be on y=2 if I went up twice, but unsafe.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on rows 1-5 at t=88.\n\nSince I start at t=86 y=0, and I need to go up.\n\nI could stay at y=0 for one turn, then go up.\n\nOr go to a safe row at t=88.\n\nt=88 is problematic for rows 1-5.\n\nRows 6 and 7 are always safe, so I could be on row 6 or 7 at t=88.\n\nBut I start from y=0, so I need to get to row 6 or 7 by t=88.\n\nt=86: y=0\n\nt=87: after action, y\n\nt=88: after action, y\n\nAt t=88, I want to be on a safe row for t=88.\n\nSafe rows at t=88: row 6,7,8? Row 8 at t=88: is it safe?\n\nRow 8: unsafe at t=86 and 87, but at t=88, as computed earlier, safe.\n\nBecause for row 8, unsafe only at t=86 and 87.\n\nAt t=88, Δt=2, second car span [ -11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nAlso rows 6 and 7 always safe.\n\nSo at t=88, safe rows are 6,7,8.\n\nNow, rows 1-5 unsafe at t=88.\n\nI need to be at one of 6,7,8 at t=88.\n\nBut at t=86, I am at y=0.\n\nFrom t=86 to t=88, two actions: I can change y by +2, +1, or 0, or -1, etc., but since I need to go up, probably +2 or +1.\n\nMax I can be at y=2 at t=88 if I go up twice.\n\nBut y=2 is row 2, unsafe at t=88.\n\nIf I go up once and stay, or something.\n\nPossible positions at t=88:\n\nAfter two actions from t=86.\n\nAt t=86, y=0.\n\nAction a_86: can be U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, y_87=1\n\nThen a_87: if U, y_88=2\n\nIf S, y_88=1\n\nIf D, y_88=0\n\nIf a_86=S, y_87=0, then a_87: U, y_88=1; S, y_88=0; D, y_88=-1, but y cannot be negative, so y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0 and action D, y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) =0, I assume, since y in [0,9].\n\nSimilarly for upper bound.\n\nSo from y=0, action D or S, y stays 0.\n\nAction U, y=1.\n\nSimilarly at other points.\n\nSo from t=86 y=0, after two actions to t=88:\n\nPossible y_88:\n\n- If a_86=U, y_87=1; then a_87=U, y_88=2\n\na_87=S, y_88=1\n\na_87=D, y_88=0\n\n- If a_86=S, y_87=0; then a_87=U, y_88=1; a_87=S, y_88=0; a_87=D, y_88=0\n\n- If a_86=D, same as S, y_87=0, then same as above.\n\nSo possible y_88: 0,1,2\n\nBut at t=88, we need y_88 to be 6,7, or 8 to be safe, but y_88 can only be 0,1,2 from starting at 0 in two moves. Impossible to be at y=6,7,8 at t=88.\n\ny=6 is row 6, which is safe, but I can't reach it in two moves from y=0.\n\nMinimal moves to go from 0 to 6 is 6 up moves, but that would take 6 actions, at t=92 or something.\n\nAt t=88, only after two actions, y can be at most 2.\n\nBut y=0,1,2 at t=88.\n\ny=0: row 0, safe, no cars.\n\ny=1: row 1, but row 1 unsafe at t=88, so if y_88=1, collision.\n\ny=2: row 2, unsafe at t=88.\n\nSo all possible positions at t=88 are unsafe! y=0 is safe, but y=0 is not between 1-8, so no issue, but if I am at y=0 at t=88, I'm not on a freeway, so safe.\n\nBut I need to eventually go up.\n\nAt t=88, if I am at y=0,1, or 2, all except y=0 are on unsafe freeways if y=1 or 2.\n\ny=0 is safe.\n\nBut I can't be at y=6,7,8 at t=88.\n\nSo for t=88, the only safe positions are y=0 or y=6,7,8, but y=6,7,8 not reachable.\n\nSo I must be at y=0 at t=88 to avoid collision? But if I am at y=0 at t=88, that means I didn't move up yet.\n\nThen at t=88, y=0, safe.\n\nNow, after that, I need to go up.\n\nBut t=88 is past, and rows 1-5 are only unsafe at t=88, so for t>88 or t<88, they are safe, except row 8 which was unsafe at t=86,87 but now safe.\n\nSince t=88 is the only unsafe time for rows 1-5, and for row 8, unsafe only at t=86,87.\n\nNow, at t=88, I can be at y=0.\n\nThen I can start moving up.\n\nBut let's see the times.\n\nI need to not be on rows 1-5 at t=88.\n\nSince I can't be on safe rows at that time, I must be below or above, but above not possible, so below, like y=0.\n\nSo, one option is to stay at y=0 for the first two turns.\n\nAt t=86, y=0, safe.\n\nAction: S or D, but S or D both keep y=0.\n\nSay action S at t=86, then y_87=0.\n\nAt t=87, y=0, which is safe, since not freeway.\n\nNow, at t=87, I need to choose action.\n\nIf I go up, a_87=U, then y_88=1.\n\nBut at t=88, y=1, row 1, which is unsafe at t=88. Collision.\n\nIf I stay, a_87=S, y_88=0, safe, but not progressing.\n\nThen at t=88, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=88, I can go up, a_88=U, to y_89=1.\n\nNow at t=89, y=1, row 1. Is row 1 safe at t=89?\n\nEarlier, row 1 unsafe only at t=88, so at t=89, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nSo after t=88, all rows are safe except that row 8 was unsafe before but now ok.\n\nLet me confirm.\n\nFor row 1: unsafe only at t=88, so for t=89,90,... safe.\n\nSimilarly row 2 to 5 same.\n\nRow 6 and 7 always safe.\n\nRow 8: unsafe at t=86 and 87, so for t=88 and later, safe.\n\nSo from t=89 onwards, all freeways are safe at all times, since no other unsafe times.\n\nIs that true?\n\nFor example, row 1: only unsafe at t=88, so for t=87, it was safe, t=89 safe, etc.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo after t=88, I can move freely.\n\nBut at t=88, I need to be safe, which I can be at y=0.\n\nThen from there, I can go up directly to y=9.\n\nNow, sequence:\n\nStart t=86, y=0\n\nTo be safe at t=88, I need to be at y=0 at t=88.\n\nSo at t=86, I must not go up; I must stay or down, but down same as stay.\n\nSo action at t=86: S (or D, but S is fine)\n\nThen y_87 = 0\n\nAt t=87, y=0, still safe.\n\nNow, if I go up at t=87, a_87=U, then y_88=1, but at t=88, y=1, which is row 1, unsafe. Collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot go up at t=87.\n\nAt t=87, I must also stay or down, to keep y=0 at t=88.\n\nSo action at t=87: S or D, y_88=0\n\nThen at t=88, y=0, safe.\n\nNow, from here, I can start going up.\n\nAt t=88, y=0\n\nAction a_88=U, then y_89=1\n\nAt t=89, y=1, which should be safe, since row 1 safe except t=88.\n\nSimilarly, then a_89=U, y_90=2\n\na_90=U, y_91=3\n\na_91=U, y_92=4\n\na_92=U, y_93=5\n\na_93=U, y_94=6\n\na_94=U, y_95=7\n\na_95=U, y_96=8\n\na_96=U, y_97=9\n\nNow, at y=9, which is goal, no cars.\n\nBut H is the number of actions, from t=86 to t=96, that's 11 actions? Let's list the turns.\n\nActions from t=86 to t=96, 11 actions, y from 0 to 9, but with two stays at beginning.\n\ny_97=9.\n\nBut I can check if I can go faster.\n\nAt t=88, after I am at y=0, I could go up faster, but I need to go through each step.\n\nSince rows 6 and 7 are always safe, and I could go to them earlier, but from y=0, it takes time.\n\nAnother idea: at t=86, I go up to y=1 at t=87.\n\nAt t=87, y=1, which is safe since row 1 unsafe only at t=88, not t=87.\n\nThen at t=87, instead of going up, I could go down or stay, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nIf at t=87, y=1, I stay: a_87=S, then y_88=1.\n\nBut at t=88, y=1, row 1 unsafe. Collision.\n\nIf I go down, a_87=D, y_88=0, then at t=88, y=0, safe.\n\nThen same as before, start from y=0 at t=88.\n\nBut I wasted a move to y=1 and back.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo better to stay at y=0 for two turns.\n\nBut is there a way to be at a higher row at t=88?\n\nFor example, if I could be at y=3 or something, but rows 1-5 all unsafe at t=88, so even if I could be there, it would be unsafe.\n\ny=3 at t=88 is row 3, unsafe.\n\nOnly y=0 or y=6+ are safe, but y=6+ not reachable.\n\nSo I must be at y=0 at t=88.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nBut in the sequence above, I have two S at start, then nine U, total 11 actions to reach y=9 at t=97.\n\nBut can I reach faster?\n\nAfter t=88, all rows safe, so I could move faster, but I can only change by 1 per turn, so from y=0 to y=9, min 9 moves, no way to skip.\n\nUnless I go down and up, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo min is 9 moves up from y=0.\n\nBut here I have two waits, so 11 turns.\n\nBut perhaps I can start moving later or something.\n\nAnother thought: since row 8 is safe after t=87, and rows 6 and 7 always safe.\n\nBut I start from bottom.\n\nPerhaps I can go to row 6 or 7 before t=88, but at t=87, for example.\n\nt=86: y=0\n\nIf I go up, a_86=U, y_87=1\n\nAt t=87, y=1, safe, as established.\n\nNow, at t=87, I can go up again, but to y=2 at t=88, unsafe.\n\nI can go to another row, but I can only change y by 1, so from y=1, I can go to y=0,1,2.\n\ny=0 or 1 or 2 at t=88, all unsafe except y=0, but y=0 not at row.\n\ny=2 at t=88 unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot avoid being on an unsafe row if I move to y=1 or 2 at t=88.\n\nUnless I stay at y=1 at t=87, but at t=87 I am at y=1, if I stay, at t=88 I am at y=1, unsafe.\n\nIf I go down to y=0 at t=88, safe.\n\nBut then I have y=1 at t=87 and y=0 at t=88.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up, same as before, but I have an extra move to y=1 and back.\n\nSo sequence: t=86, a=U, y_87=1\n\nt=87, a=D, y_88=0\n\nThen t=88, a=U, y_89=1\n\netc., to y=9.\n\nCompared to staying: t=86 S, y_87=0; t=87 S, y_88=0; t=88 U, y_89=1; ... same as before but with an extra down move, so worse.\n\nt=86 U to y_87=1; t=87 D to y_88=0; then from t=88 U to y_89=1, same as if I stayed twice but started from y_88=0 with U to y_89=1.\n\nIn the stay case: actions at t=86 S, t=87 S, t=88 U, ..., up to t=96 U to y_97=9.\n\n11 actions.\n\nIf I do U then D: t=86 U, t=87 D, then at t=88 y=0, then t=88 U to y_89=1, ..., up to t=96 U to y_97=9? t=88 U to y_89=1, t=89 U to y_90=2, ..., t=96 U to y_97=9, but from t=88 to t=96 is 9 actions? t=88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96: 9 actions to go from y_89=1 to y_97=9? y_89=1 after action at t=88.\n\nAfter action at t=88: y_89=1\n\nThen to reach y=9, need y_{t} =9 for some t.\n\ny_89=1\n\nThen a_89 U, y_90=2\n\n...\n\na_95 U, y_96=7\n\na_96 U, y_97=8\n\na_97 U, y_98=9\n\nSo actions from t=88 to t=97, 10 actions to go from y_89=1 to y_98=9.\n\nBut I had actions at t=86 U and t=87 D, so total 12 actions, worse than 11.\n\nSo better to stay twice.\n\nBut in the stay twice case, actions: t=86 S, t=87 S, t=88 U, t=89 U, ..., t=96 U to y_97=9? Let's list y values:\n\nTurn: position at start of turn\n\nt=86: y=0\n\na_86=S → y_87=0\n\nt=87: y=0\n\na_87=S → y_88=0\n\nt=88: y=0\n\na_88=U → y_89=1\n\nt=89: y=1\n\na_89=U → y_90=2\n\nt=90: y=2\n\na_90=U → y_91=3\n\nt=91: y=3\n\na_91=U → y_92=4\n\nt=92: y=4\n\na_92=U → y_93=5\n\nt=93: y=5\n\na_93=U → y_94=6\n\nt=94: y=6\n\na_94=U → y_95=7\n\nt=95: y=7\n\na_95=U → y_96=8\n\nt=96: y=8\n\na_96=U → y_97=9\n\nNow at t=97, y=9, goal.\n\nActions from t=86 to t=96, that's 11 actions: t=86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96.\n\nNumber of actions: 11.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut can I do with less?\n\nPerhaps I can go to a row that is safe at t=88, but as before, I can't reach row 6-8 in time.\n\nSince row 6 and 7 are always safe, I could go directly to them, but from y=0, min 6 moves to y=6.\n\nAt t=86, if I go up every turn, at t=92 I would be at y=6, but let's see.\n\nt=86: y=0, a=U, y_87=1\n\nt=87: y=1, a=U, y_88=2 → but at t=88, y=2, unsafe.\n\nProblem at t=88.\n\nIf I delay, but I need to be not on row 1-5 at t=88.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=5 by t=91 or something.\n\nt=86: a=U, y_87=1\n\nAt t=87, y=1, if I stay, a=S, y_88=1, unsafe.\n\nIf I go down, worse.\n\nSo I must not be on y=1 to 5 at t=88.\n\nThe only way is to be at y=0 at t=88.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=6 at t=88, but impossible in two moves.\n\nSo I think 11 is the minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm if at other times there are issues.\n\nAfter t=88, all clear.\n\nAnother thing: at the beginning, row 8 is unsafe at t=86 and 87.\n\nBut since I start at y=0, and if I go to y=8 later, after t=87, it should be fine.\n\nIn this path, I go to y=8 at t=96, which is after t=88, safe.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nPerhaps I can start moving earlier but avoid the unsafe time.\n\nFor example, at t=86, I go up to y=1 at t=87.\n\nAt t=87, y=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=87, instead of going to y=2 at t=88, I can only stay or go down, both lead to y=1 or 0 at t=88.\n\ny=1 unsafe, y=0 safe but I have to go down.\n\nThen proceed from y=0 at t=88, same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo I think minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, sequence of actions:\n\nFrom above: actions at\n\nt=86: S\n\nt=87: S\n\nt=88: U\n\nt=89: U\n\nt=90: U\n\nt=91: U\n\nt=92: U\n\nt=93: U\n\nt=94: U\n\nt=95: U\n\nt=96: U\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 97.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=86 to t=96.\n\nBut at t=96, action U, to y_97=9.\n\nNow, in the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nt_1 = 86\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 86: S\n\nTurn 87: S\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nTurn 93: U\n\nTurn 94: U\n\nTurn 95: U\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 97, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions H=11.\n\nBut let me make sure that at no point I am on an unsafe position.\n\nAt turn 86: y=0, safe\n\nAfter a_86=S, y_87=0\n\nTurn 87: y=0, safe (not freeway)\n\nAfter a_87=S, y_88=0\n\nTurn 88: y=0, safe\n\nAfter a_88=U, y_89=1\n\nTurn 89: y=1, row 1. At t=89, which is not 88, so safe. Car on row 1: at t=89, Δt=3, span [48-36(3), 83-36(3)] = [48-108, 83-108] = [-60,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 2 same.\n\nNow, when I go to row 8, at say turn 96: y=8, row 8.\n\nAt t=96, Δt=96-86=10\n\nFor row 8, cars: first car (48,37,right,6), span at T: [37 +6*10, 48+6*10] = [37+60,48+60]=[97,108], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car (0,-11,right,6), span at T: [-11+6*10, 0+60] = [-11+60,60] = [49,60], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nAnd y=9 no issue.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nSuppose I go up immediately but skip the unsafe row at t=88 by being on a different row.\n\nBut since I have to go through the rows, and at t=88, rows 1-5 are all unsafe, and I can't be on 6-8, so no.\n\nPerhaps I can be on row 6 at t=88, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: since row 6 and 7 are always safe, I could go to row 6 quickly and stay, but I start from 0.\n\nMin turns to row 6: 6 up moves.\n\nBut if I start at t=86 U to y_87=1\n\nt=87 U to y_88=2, but unsafe at t=88.\n\nIf I do more stays, but I need to reach row 6 at some time when it's safe, but it's always safe, but I can't reach before t=88 without being on lower rows at t=88.\n\nFor example, to be at y=6 at t=88: need to go up 6 times in 2 moves? Impossible.\n\nEarliest to be at y=6: if I go up every turn from t=86 to t=91: t=86 U y87=1, t87 U y88=2 (unsafe), t88 U y89=3, t89 U y90=4, t90 U y91=5, t91 U y92=6. So at t=92, y=6.\n\nBut at t=88, I was at y=2, which was unsafe.\n\nSo collision.\n\nIf I start later, but I have to wait at y=0 until after t=88.\n\nSo I think no shorter way.\n\nThus minimal H=11.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have two S at start.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nt_1=86.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 86: S\n\nTurn 87: S\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nTurn 93: U\n\nTurn 94: U\n\nTurn 95: U\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nAnd that's 11 actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nAnswer Format:\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\n}\n\nSo for t_1=86:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 86: S Turn 87: S Turn 88: U Turn 89: U Turn 90: U Turn 91: U Turn 92: U Turn 93: U Turn 94: U Turn 95: U Turn 96: U }\n\nBut I think it should be until the last action.\n\nSince I reach at turn 97, but the last action is at turn 96.\n\nIn the sequence, the actions are from t=86 to t=96.\n\nH=11 turns of actions.\n\nPerhaps I can use D, but S is fine.\n\nIn the action, S or D both keep y=0, but S is simpler.\n\nNow, I think that's the minimal.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is row 3 or others safe at other times? For example, at t=87, row 1 is safe, as I used.\n\nBut I couldn't take advantage.\n\nAnother point: when I move to a new row, I am not on that row until next turn, so for example, at turn T, I am at y_T, I choose to move to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I am still on y_T for collision.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 86\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11. The sequence of actions ensures that the player is never on a freeway row (1 to 8) at a turn when that row is unsafe due to a car covering position \\(x = 0\\).\n\n### Analysis of Unsafe Times:\n- Freeways 1 to 5 are unsafe only at turn \\(T = 88\\).\n- Freeway 8 is unsafe at turns \\(T = 86\\) and \\(T = 87\\).\n- Freeways 6 and 7 are always safe.\n- At turn \\(T = 88\\), the only safe positions are \\(y = 0\\) (no freeway) or \\(y = 6, 7, 8\\) (freeways 6 and 7 are always safe; freeway 8 is safe at \\(T = 88\\)).\n- However, from the starting position \\(y = 0\\) at turn 86, it is impossible to reach \\(y = 6, 7,\\) or \\(8\\) by turn 88 (within 2 actions) since the maximum vertical change in 2 actions is \\(+2\\), reaching only \\(y = 2\\).\n- Therefore, to avoid collision at turn 88, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 88. This requires staying at \\(y = 0\\) for the first two turns (actions: S at turn 86 and S at turn 87).\n- After turn 88, all freeways are safe at all times (freeways 1-5 unsafe only at 88; freeway 8 unsafe only at 86 and 87; freeways 6-7 always safe). Thus, the player can move directly upward from turn 88 onward.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions from turn 86 to turn 96 (11 actions) results in the player reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 97:\n- At turn 86: Action S → \\(y_{87} = 0\\) (safe, not on freeway).\n- At turn 87: Action S → \\(y_{88} = 0\\) (safe, not on freeway).\n- At turn 88: Action U → \\(y_{89} = 1\\) (row 1 safe at \\(T = 89\\)).\n- At turn 89: Action U → \\(y_{90} = 2\\) (row 2 safe at \\(T = 90\\)).\n- At turn 90: Action U → \\(y_{91} = 3\\) (row 3 safe at \\(T = 91\\)).\n- At turn 91: Action U → \\(y_{92} = 4\\) (row 4 safe at \\(T = 92\\)).\n- At turn 92: Action U → \\(y_{93} = 5\\) (row 5 safe at \\(T = 93\\)).\n- At turn 93: Action U → \\(y_{94} = 6\\) (row 6 always safe).\n- At turn 94: Action U → \\(y_{95} = 7\\) (row 7 always safe).\n- At turn 95: Action U → \\(y_{96} = 8\\) (row 8 safe at \\(T = 95\\)).\n- At turn 96: Action U → \\(y_{97} = 9\\) (goal reached, no cars at \\(y = 9\\)).\n\n### Verification:\n- No collisions occur:\n  - Turns 86 and 87: Player at \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n  - Turn 88: Player at \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n  - Turns 89 to 95: Player on rows 1 to 8, but all are safe after turn 88 (no car covers \\(x = 0\\) at these times).\n  - Turn 96: Player at \\(y = 8\\) (row 8 safe at \\(T = 96\\)).\n- Minimal \\(H = 11\\): Any sequence with fewer than 11 actions either risks collision at turn 88 (if not at \\(y = 0\\)) or cannot reach \\(y = 9\\) faster due to the need for at least 9 upward moves and 2 initial stays to avoid the unsafe turn.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 86: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 89: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 90: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 91: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 92: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 93: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 94: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 95: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 96: \\text{ U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get the player from (0,0) at turn 90 to (0,9) as quickly as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to 8. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right at constant speeds, and I need to avoid being on a row where a car covers x=0 at the exact turn when I'm on that row. Importantly, when I move to a new row, I'm not on that new row until the next turn, so I only check for collision on the row I'm currently on at the beginning of the turn.\n\nLet me list all the cars and their positions at turn 90, since that's the starting point.\n\nFor each freeway, I have cars with head, tail, direction, and speed.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, (48, 83, left, 36). Since direction is left, it's moving left, so head is at 48, tail at 83? That doesn't make sense because if it's moving left, the head should be smaller than tail, I think. Let me read the car update rules.\n\nFor left-moving cars: span at t1 is [h, τ] and at T, it's [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ, h] to [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the input, for freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36). If it's left-moving, and span is given as (head, tail), but for left-moving, head is the left end? I need to interpret the head and tail based on direction.\n\nLooking at the car state table:\n\nFor freeway 3,4,5: they have multiple cars, like (48,37, right,12), etc.\n\nAnd for right-moving, it says: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s dt, h + s dt]\n\nSimilarly for left: [h, τ] → [h - s dt, τ - s dt]\n\nSo in the notation (head, tail, direction, speed), I think \"head\" is the leading end, and \"tail\" is the trailing end, but for movement, when moving left, the left end is the head, and when moving right, the right end is the head.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nFor a left-moving car, head is the front when moving left, so smaller x, and tail is larger x. So span is from small to large: [head, tail] with head < tail.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (48,83,left,36), so head=48, tail=83, so at t1=90, span is [48,83].\n\nSince moving left, at time T, span is [48 - 36*(T-90), 83 - 36*(T-90)]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like (48,37,right,12) on freeway 3: direction right, so head is the right end, so for right-moving, span is [tail, head] with tail < head? Let's see.\n\nFor right-moving: it says Span(t1) = [τ, h] and moves to [τ + s dt, h + s dt]\n\nIn the input, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for right, head is larger, tail is smaller? In freeway 3: (48,37,right,12), so I think head=48, tail=37, and since right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [37,48] at t1.\n\nThen at T, [37 + 12*(T-90), 48 + 12*(T-90)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y at turn T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at that turn.\n\nAnd when the player moves, at turn T, they are on y_T, and after action, they go to y_{T+1}, so during turn T, they are on y_T, so collision check is for y_T at turn T.\n\nIf they move to a new row, they are not on that row until T+1.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at t=90 to y=9 at some turn, with minimal turns.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 should be safe, no cars, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe, but we start there.\n\nThe player position is given as (0, y), so x is always 0, I think, since it's a vertical movement, and cars are on the rows.\n\nThe grid is 2D, but player only moves vertically, x=0 fixed? The position is (0, y_t), so I think player is always at x=0, moving up and down on y-axis, and cars are on horizontal freeways at different y-levels.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, to reach (0,9), meaning y=9.\n\nNow, at each turn, for each freeway row, I need to check when cars cover x=0.\n\nFor a given freeway and car, find when 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nSet dt = T - 90, so at turn T = 90 + dt.\n\nFor each car, find for which dt, 0 is in the span.\n\nThen, for that freeway, at times when no car covers x=0, it's safe to be on that row.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars, I need the union of times when any car covers x=0.\n\nThen, for each row, find the safe intervals when no car at x=0.\n\nThen, I can plan a path through these safe intervals.\n\nSince I need minimal H, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid rows when they are dangerous.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway y=1: one car: (48,83,left,36)\n\nLeft-moving, span at t=90: [48,83]\n\nAt T=90+dt, span: [48 - 36 dt, 83 - 36 dt]\n\n0 in span when 48 - 36 dt <= 0 <= 83 - 36 dt\n\nSo 48 - 36 dt <= 0 => 36 dt >= 48 => dt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\nAnd 0 <= 83 - 36 dt => 36 dt <= 83 => dt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSo for dt from ceil(1.333) to floor(2.305), since turns are integer, dt must be integer.\n\nT is turn, dt integer.\n\nSo dt >= ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) = 2? dt min when 48 - 36 dt <= 0, so 36 dt >= 48, dt >= 48/36 = 4/3, since dt integer, dt >= 2.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 83 - 36 dt, 36 dt <= 83, dt <= 83/36 = 2.305, so dt <= 2.\n\ndt >= 2 and dt <= 2, so only at dt=2.\n\nLet me calculate:\n\n36 dt >= 48 => dt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so since dt integer, dt >= 2\n\n36 dt <= 83 => dt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so dt <= 2\n\nThus dt=2.\n\nSo at T=90+2=92, the car covers x=0 on freeway 1.\n\nAt other times, no cover.\n\nSince only one car, so freeway 1 is dangerous only at T=92.\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nNow freeway 2: (48,83,left,36) same as freeway 1, so also dangerous only at T=92.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAll right-moving, speed 12.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, span at t=90: [τ, h] = [37,48] since head=48, tail=37.\n\nIn notation (head, tail, dir, speed), for right, head is larger, tail smaller, so span [tail, head] = [37,48]\n\nAt T=90+dt, [37 + 12 dt, 48 + 12 dt]\n\n0 in span: 37 + 12 dt <= 0 <= 48 + 12 dt\n\nBut 37 + 12 dt <= 0? 12 dt <= -37, dt <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, which is less than 0, not possible for dt >=0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 48 + 12 dt always true for dt>=0.\n\nBut left inequality: 37 + 12 dt <= 0 requires dt <= -37/12 <0, impossible.\n\nSo for this car, 0 is never in span for dt>=0.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12)\n\nSpan at t=90: [tail, head] = [1,12]\n\nAt T: [1 + 12 dt, 12 + 12 dt]\n\n0 in span: 1 + 12 dt <= 0 <= 12 + 12 dt\n\n1 + 12 dt <= 0 => 12 dt <= -1 => dt <= -1/12 <0, impossible.\n\n0 <= 12 + 12 dt always true.\n\nSo no.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12)\n\n(-24,-35), head=-24? tail=-35? Direction right.\n\nSpan: [τ, h] = [-35, -24] because tail is smaller, head larger for right-moving? tail=-35, head=-24, so τ=-35, h=-24, span [-35, -24]\n\nAt T: [-35 + 12 dt, -24 + 12 dt]\n\n0 in span: -35 + 12 dt <= 0 <= -24 + 12 dt\n\nFirst inequality: -35 + 12 dt <= 0 => 12 dt <= 35 => dt <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 + 12 dt => 12 dt >= 24 => dt >= 2\n\nSo dt >= 2 and dt <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so dt=2 or dt=3? dt integer.\n\ndt >=2 and dt <= floor(35/12)= floor(2.916)=2? 35/12=2.916, so dt <=2.916, so dt=2 since dt integer.\n\ndt >=2 and dt <=2.916, so dt=2.\n\nAt dt=2: -35 + 12*2 = -35+24= -11 <=0? -11 <=0 true, and 0 <= -24 +24=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nAt dt=3: -35+36=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, so not.\n\nSo only at dt=2.\n\nThus for freeway 3, only the third car covers x=0 at T=92.\n\nNow, other cars don't cover at any time, so overall, freeway 3 dangerous only at T=92.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same cars as freeway 3? \" (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) \" same as freeway 3.\n\nSo also dangerous only at T=92.\n\nFreeway 5: same, dangerous only at T=92.\n\nNow freeway 6: only one car: (48,37,right,6)\n\n(48,37,right,6), so span at t=90: [37,48] for right-moving.\n\nAt T: [37 + 6 dt, 48 + 6 dt]\n\n0 in span: 37 + 6 dt <= 0 <= 48 + 6 dt\n\n37 + 6 dt <=0? 6 dt <= -37, dt <= -37/6 <0 impossible.\n\n0 <=48 +6 dt always true.\n\nSo never covers x=0. So freeway 6 always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: (48,37,right,6) same as above, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars: (48,37,right,6), (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6), same as above, never covers x=0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6)\n\n(0,-11,right,6), head=0, tail=-11? Direction right.\n\nSpan: [τ, h] = [-11, 0] at t=90.\n\nAt T: [-11 + 6 dt, 0 + 6 dt] = [-11 + 6 dt, 6 dt]\n\n0 in span: -11 + 6 dt <= 0 <= 6 dt\n\nFirst: -11 + 6 dt <= 0 => 6 dt <= 11 => dt <= 11/6 ≈ 1.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= 6 dt => dt >= 0\n\nBut dt >=0 and dt <=1.833, so dt=0,1\n\nAt dt=0: T=90, span [-11,0], 0 is included, since <=0 and >=? -11 <=0 <=0, yes, 0<=0 true.\n\nAt dt=1: T=91, span [-11+6,6] = [-5,6], 0 in [-5,6], yes.\n\nAt dt=2: T=92, span [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12], since 1>0.\n\nSo for freeway 8, second car covers x=0 at dt=0 and dt=1, i.e., T=90 and T=91.\n\nFirst car never covers, so freeway 8 dangerous at T=90 and T=91.\n\nNow, summary for each freeway when dangerous:\n\ny=1: dangerous at T=92\n\ny=2: dangerous at T=92\n\ny=3: dangerous at T=92\n\ny=4: dangerous at T=92\n\ny=5: dangerous at T=92\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: dangerous at T=90 and T=91\n\nAlso, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so always safe, I assume.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at T=90.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal turns, so I should go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on a row when it is dangerous.\n\nAt each turn, when I am on a row, it must be safe at that turn.\n\nFor example, at T=90, I am at y=0, which is safe.\n\nI can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go up, to y=1 at T=91.\n\nBut at T=91, where am I?\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nAfter action at T, I move to y_{T+1}.\n\nAt T=90, I am at y=0.\n\nI take action a_{90}, then y_{91} = y_90 + Δy.\n\nSimilarly, at T=91, I am at y_{91}, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T if when I am at y_T, and y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, x=0 is covered by a car at turn T.\n\nNow, at T=90, I am at y=0, which is not a freeway, so no collision possible, I think. Similarly for y=9.\n\nIn the problem, freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe.\n\nAt T=90, y=0 safe.\n\nNow, if I take action U at T=90, I go to y=1 at T=91.\n\nBut at T=91, I will be on y=1.\n\nNow, y=1 is dangerous only at T=92, not at T=91, so at T=91, y=1 is safe? Let me check.\n\nFreeway 1 dangerous only at T=92, so at T=91, freeway 1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nBut y=8 is dangerous at T=90 and T=91.\n\nAt T=90, y=8 is dangerous, but I'm not on it.\n\nAt T=91, y=8 dangerous.\n\nBut if I move to y=8 at T=91, it would be dangerous, but I start from y=0.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nSince I need minimal turns, going directly up might work, but let's see the dangers.\n\nThe dangers are at T=92 for rows y=1,2,3,4,5.\n\nAnd y=8 dangerous at T=90 and T=91.\n\nNow, T=90: I am at y=0, safe.\n\nI can move up to y=1 at T=91.\n\nAt T=91, I am at y=1. Since y=1 is safe at T=91 (only dangerous at T=92), so ok.\n\nThen at T=91, I can move up to y=2 at T=92.\n\nBut at T=92, if I am at y=2, it is dangerous, since y=2 dangerous at T=92.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay or go down, but I need to go up.\n\nAt T=91, I am at y=1, I could stay or go down, but that might not help.\n\nI could go up to y=2 at T=92, but y=2 is dangerous at T=92, so if I am on y=2 at T=92, collision.\n\nSo I must avoid being on rows 1-5 at T=92.\n\nSimilarly, rows 1,2,3,4,5 all dangerous at T=92.\n\ny=6 and y=7 always safe.\n\ny=8 dangerous at T=90 and T=91, but safe after.\n\nT=90 and T=91 dangerous for y=8.\n\nNow, let's list safe times for each row:\n\ny=1: safe except T=92\n\ny=2: safe except T=92\n\ny=3: safe except T=92\n\ny=4: safe except T=92\n\ny=5: safe except T=92\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: safe except T=90 and T=91 (i.e., dangerous at dt=0 and dt=1)\n\ny=0: always safe? Not a freeway.\n\ny=9: always safe.\n\nNow, I start at T=90, y=0.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so minimum turns: from y=0 to y=9, at least 9 moves up, but I can stay or go down, but to minimize time, I should go up as much as possible.\n\nBut with obstacles, I might need to wait or detour.\n\nIn this case, the only problems are at specific times.\n\nSpecifically, at T=92, rows 1-5 are all dangerous, so I cannot be on y=1 to 5 at T=92.\n\nAlso, at T=90 and T=91, y=8 is dangerous, so I cannot be on y=8 at those times.\n\nSince I start at T=90, y=0, and T=90 is happening now.\n\nNow, let me consider the sequence of turns.\n\nSet t = 0 for dt, so turn 90 + t for t=0,1,2,...\n\nAt t=0 (T=90): I am at y=0, safe.\n\nI take action a_{90}, which determines y_{91}.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI need y_{H} = 9 for some H, but since actions from t=0 to H-1, and after H-1 actions, I reach y_{t1 + H-1} =9.\n\nStart at turn t1=90, position at start of turn.\n\nAfter H turns, I have taken H actions, and I am at y_{90 + H}.\n\nAnd I need y_{90 + H} =9.\n\nWith H minimal.\n\nNow, y changes by at most 1 per turn, so to go from 0 to 9, H >=9.\n\nBut with obstacles, H might be more.\n\nFirst, can I do it in 9 turns? That is, go up every turn.\n\nStart: t=0, T=90, y=0\n\nAction U: to y=1 at t=1, T=91\n\nAt T=91, y=1, which is safe, since only dangerous at T=92.\n\nAction U: to y=2 at t=2, T=92\n\nBut at T=92, y=2, which is dangerous! Collision.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nIf at T=91, I stay: action S, then at T=92, I am still at y=1, which is dangerous at T=92.\n\nOr go down to y=0, but then not progressing.\n\nSo at T=91, I cannot go to y=2 at T=92 because y=2 dangerous, and I cannot stay on y=1 because dangerous.\n\nSo for a direct up path, I must avoid being on rows 1-5 at T=92.\n\nSince rows 1-5 are all dangerous at T=92, the only safe rows at T=92 are y=0,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=0 and y=9 are safe, y=6 and y=7 always safe, y=8 is dangerous at T=90 and T=91, but at T=92, y=8 is safe, since dangerous only at t=0 and t=1.\n\nAt T=92, dt=2, y=8 safe.\n\nSo at T=92, safe rows: 0,6,7,8,9.\n\nI need to be at y=9 eventually.\n\nNow, at T=91, where can I be?\n\nT=91, dt=1.\n\ny=1 safe? At T=91, dt=1, y=1 safe, as before.\n\ny=2 safe, similarly.\n\ny=3,4,5 all safe at T=91.\n\ny=6 safe.\n\ny=7 safe.\n\ny=8 dangerous at T=91.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nNow, I start at T=90, y=0.\n\nTo reach y=9 quickly.\n\nOne way: go to higher safe rows quickly.\n\nFor example, since y=6 and y=7 are always safe, I could go there.\n\nBut I need to pass through lower rows.\n\nAt T=90, I am at y=0.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=1 at T=91.\n\nThen at T=91, I am at y=1.\n\nNow, I need to not be on 1-5 at T=92.\n\nSo at T=92, I must be on y=0,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut from y=1 at T=91, in one move, I can go to y=0,1,2 at T=92.\n\ny=0: possible, but low.\n\ny=1: dangerous at T=92.\n\ny=2: dangerous at T=92.\n\nSo all options from y=1 at T=91 lead to danger or no progress at T=92.\n\ny=0 is safe but I was just there.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=1 at T=91, because from there, I have no safe move to avoid T=92 danger except back to y=0.\n\nBut then I waste time.\n\nSimilarly, if I am at y=2 at T=91, I can go to y=1,2,3 at T=92, all dangerous.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo, to avoid being forced into danger, I should not be on rows 1-5 at T=91? Not necessarily.\n\nAt T=91, rows 1-5 are safe, but the problem is the next turn.\n\nI need to be at a position at T=91 such that I can move to a safe row at T=92.\n\nSafe rows at T=92: y=0,6,7,8,9.\n\nNow, from where at T=91 can I reach these in one move.\n\nAt T=91, I can be at y, and move to y-1, y, y+1 at T=92.\n\nSo to reach y=6 at T=92, I need at T=91 to be at y=5,6,7.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=7 at T=92, from y=6,7,8 at T=91.\n\ny=8 at T=92, from y=7,8,9 at T=91.\n\ny=9 at T=92, from y=8,9,10 but y=10 invalid, so from y=8 or 9.\n\ny=0 from y=0 or 1.\n\nNow, at T=91, which of these positions are safe.\n\nAt T=91, dt=1.\n\ny=1 safe\n\ny=2 safe\n\ny=3 safe\n\ny=4 safe\n\ny=5 safe\n\ny=6 safe\n\ny=7 safe\n\ny=8 dangerous! Because y=8 dangerous at T=91.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nSo, at T=91, safe rows: y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9\n\ny=8 dangerous.\n\nNow, from T=91, to reach safe T=92 rows:\n\n- To reach y=6 at T=92: need at T=91 y=5,6,7\n\ny=5,6,7 all safe at T=91.\n\n- To reach y=7 at T=92: need y=6,7,8 at T=91\n\nBut y=8 dangerous at T=91, so not safe to be there. So only from y=6 or 7.\n\n- To reach y=8 at T=92: need y=7,8,9 at T=91. y=8 dangerous, so from y=7 or 9.\n\n- To reach y=9 at T=92: from y=8 or 9. y=8 dangerous, so only from y=9.\n\n- To reach y=0 at T=92: from y=0 or 1. y=0 not at T=91, since we are at T=91.\n\nAt T=91, we are at some y.\n\nNow, back to start.\n\nAt T=90, y=0.\n\nI take action to go to some y at T=91.\n\nPossible actions: U to y=1, S to y=0, D to y=-1 invalid, so only U or S.\n\nIf S, stay at y=0 at T=91, but then I waste a turn, not good for minimal time.\n\nSo better to go U to y=1 at T=91.\n\nAssume we do that.\n\nAt T=91, y=1, safe.\n\nNow, I need to move such that at T=92, I am on safe row: 0,6,7,8,9.\n\nFrom y=1 at T=91, I can go to:\n\n- D: to y=0 at T=92\n\n- S: to y=1 at T=92, dangerous\n\n- U: to y=2 at T=92, dangerous\n\nSo only safe choice is to go down to y=0 at T=92.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, but then at T=92, I am back to start, almost.\n\nThen at T=92, I can go up again, but I lost two turns.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=90: y=0, action U\n\nT=91: y=1, action D\n\nT=92: y=0, safe\n\nThen at T=92, y=0, I can go U to y=1 at T=93.\n\nNow, T=93, dt=3.\n\nWhat about the dangers?\n\nEarlier dangers were at specific times.\n\nAt T=93, dt=3.\n\ny=1: dangerous only at T=92, so at T=93 safe.\n\nSimilarly y=2,3,4,5 all safe at T=93.\n\ny=8 safe.\n\nOnly y=8 was dangerous at T=90,91, but at T=93, safe.\n\nSo at T=92, y=0, action U to y=1 at T=93.\n\nT=93: y=1, safe.\n\nThen I can go up each turn to y=2 at T=94, y=3 at T=95, ..., up to y=9 at T=101? Let's see.\n\nFrom y=0 at T=92 to y=9.\n\ny=0 at T=92 to y=9 at T=101? 9 moves.\n\nBut T=92 to T=101 is 9 turns? T=92 to T=93: +1, ..., to T=101 is 9 steps? Start at T=92 y=0, after one action at T=92 to y=1 at T=93.\n\nAfter k actions, at T=92 + k.\n\nSet: at turn T, after action, to y_{T+1}.\n\nBut position at start of turn.\n\nAt start of T=92, y=0.\n\nAction U: to y=1 at start of T=93.\n\nAction at T=92: U, so y_{93} = y_{92} +1 =1\n\nThen at T=93, y=1, action U to y=2 at T=94, and so on.\n\nTo reach y=9, need to go from y=0 to y=9, 9 steps.\n\nSo from T=92 y=0 to T=101 y=9? T=92 to T=93: y=1, T=94: y=2, ..., T=101: y=9? T=92 +9 = T=101, y=9.\n\nT=92: start y=0\n\nAfter action at T=92: y=1 at T=93\n\nT=93: y=1\n\nAction at T=93: to y=2 at T=94\n\n...\n\nAction at T=100: to y=9 at T=101\n\nSo at T=101, y=9, done.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=92 to T=100, actions at t=92 to 100, that's 9 actions? Let's index.\n\nStart turn T=90.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn T=90 + H, position y_{90+H}\n\nSet to 9.\n\nIn the sequence: actions at turns 90,91,92,..., up to 90+H-1, and at turn 90+H, y=9.\n\nIn my earlier, I was at T=92 y=0 after two actions? Let's clarify.\n\nStart: turn 90, y=0\n\nAction a90: then y91 = y90 + Δa90\n\nIf a90=U, y91=1\n\nThen at turn 91, y=1\n\nAction a91: to y92\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIn my detour:\n\nT=90: y=0, action U → y91=1\n\nT=91: y=1, action D → y92=0\n\nT=92: y=0, now action U → y93=1\n\nT=93: y=1, action U → y94=2\n\nT=94: y=2, action U → y95=3\n\nT=95: y=3, action U → y96=4\n\nT=96: y=4, action U → y97=5\n\nT=97: y=5, action U → y98=6\n\nT=98: y=6, action U → y99=7\n\nT=99: y=7, action U → y100=8\n\nT=100: y=8, action U → y101=9\n\nT=101: y=9, done.\n\nSo H=11 actions? Turns from 90 to 100 inclusive for actions? Actions at t=90 to 100, that's 11 actions, to reach at turn 101.\n\nNumber of actions H: from t=90 to t=90+H-1, so H actions, reach at turn t=90+H.\n\nHere, at t=101, y=9, so 90+H=101, H=11.\n\nBut minimal should be less.\n\nSince y=6 and y=7 always safe, I could go directly to them earlier.\n\nFor example, from start.\n\nAt T=90, y=0.\n\nInstead of going to y=1, I need to reach higher rows faster, but I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nAnother idea: at T=92, I need to be on y=6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 0.\n\nBut y=0 is low, y=9 high.\n\nSince y=6 and y=7 are safe, I can be there at any time.\n\nNow, at T=91, I can be at y=1 to 7 or 9, but not 8.\n\nTo be at y=6 or 7 at T=92, I need to be at y=5,6,7 at T=91.\n\ny=5,6,7 are safe at T=91.\n\nNow, at T=90, I am at y=0, so to be at y=5,6,7 at T=91, I need to jump, impossible. I can only be at y=1 or 0 at T=91.\n\nFrom y=0, only to y=1 or 0.\n\nSo at T=91, I can only be at y=0 or 1.\n\nIf y=0, not progress.\n\nIf y=1, as before, then I have to go down to y=0 at T=92 to avoid danger.\n\nBut that wastes time.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=1 at T=91, then at T=91, instead of moving down, I move up, but to y=2 at T=92 which is dangerous.\n\nNot possible.\n\nUnless I can be on a row that is safe at T=92, but from y=1, I can only reach y=0,1,2, all of which are dangerous or low at T=92 except y=0.\n\ny=0 safe but low.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nBut I can delay or something.\n\nAnother thought: since the danger is only at T=92 for rows 1-5, I can be on those rows before or after T=92.\n\nFor example, I can go up to y=5 before T=92, but at T=92, I need to not be on 1-5.\n\nAt T=91, I can be at y=5, for example.\n\nHow?\n\nAt T=90, y=0, go U to y=1 at T=91.\n\nBut at T=91, y=1, to go to y=5, I need multiple up moves, but I have only one move to T=92.\n\nNot possible.\n\nFrom start, it takes multiple turns to reach higher rows.\n\nLet's list possible paths with minimal delay.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe critical point is to avoid rows 1-5 at T=92.\n\nSo, one way is to be on y=0 at T=92, as I did, but then it takes many turns.\n\nBe on y=6 at T=92.\n\nTo be at y=6 at T=92, I need to be at y=5,6, or 7 at T=91.\n\nBut at T=91, I can only be at y=0 or 1, since from y=0 at T=90.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=5,6,7 at T=91.\n\nSimilarly for y=7 at T=92, need y=6,7,8 at T=91, but y=8 dangerous at T=91, and I can't be at y=6 or 7 from start in one step.\n\nSo only possible safe positions at T=92 are y=0 or y=9, but y=9 is far.\n\ny=9 at T=92: to be at y=9 at T=92, I need to be at y=8 or 9 at T=91.\n\nBut at T=91, y=8 is dangerous, so only from y=9 at T=91.\n\nBut at T=91, I am at most at y=1, so impossible.\n\nThus, the only feasible safe position at T=92 is y=0.\n\nTherefore, I must be at y=0 at T=92 to avoid collision.\n\nThen, from there, I can proceed up safely.\n\nAs in my earlier plan, it takes 11 actions to reach y=9 at T=101.\n\nBut H=11, with actions from t=90 to t=100.\n\nBut perhaps I can go faster after T=92.\n\nAfter T=92, all rows are safe except for the past dangers which are gone.\n\ny=8 was dangerous at T=90,91, but after that safe.\n\nSo from T=92 y=0, I can go up every turn.\n\nBut to go from y=0 to y=9, 9 up moves, from T=92 to T=101, as above.\n\nBut is there a way to be higher at T=92?\n\nFor example, if I could be on y=6 at T=92, but I can't from start.\n\nUnless I start moving earlier, but I start at T=90 y=0.\n\nAnother idea: at T=90, instead of going up, I stay at y=0.\n\nThen at T=91, I am at y=0.\n\nThen I can go U to y=1 at T=92.\n\nBut at T=92, y=1 is dangerous! Collision.\n\nIf I go U at T=90 to y=1 at T=91, then at T=91, I go S or D, to y=1 or 0 at T=92, both dangerous or low.\n\ny=1 at T=92 dangerous, y=0 safe but low.\n\nSo same as before.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=6 directly, but it takes time.\n\nLet's think about the car on y=8.\n\ny=8 is dangerous at T=90 and T=91.\n\nAt T=90, if I were on y=8, dangerous, but I'm at y=0.\n\nAt T=91, y=8 dangerous.\n\nAt T=92, y=8 safe.\n\nSince y=6 and y=7 are always safe, I could go to y=6 as soon as possible, then to y=7, then to y=8 after T=91, then to y=9.\n\nFor example, from start:\n\nT=90: y=0, action U to y=1 at T=91\n\nT=91: y=1, action U to y=2 at T=92? But y=2 at T=92 dangerous.\n\nNot possible.\n\nT=90: y=0, action U to y=1 at T=91\n\nT=91: y=1, action S to y=1 at T=92? Dangerous.\n\nOr action D to y=0 at T=92, safe.\n\nThen T=92: y=0, action U to y=1 at T=93\n\nT=93: y=1, action U to y=2 at T=94\n\n...\nBut slow.\n\nTo reach y=6 faster, I need to move up multiple times before T=92.\n\nBut at T=92, I must not be on 1-5.\n\nSo, for example, if I can be on y=6 at T=92.\n\nBut to be at y=6 at T=92, I need to have y=6 at the start of T=92.\n\nThat means at T=91, after action, y=6.\n\nSo at T=91, I must be at y=5,6, or 7, and take action to y=6.\n\nBut at T=91, I can only be at y=0 or 1, so impossible to be at y=5,6,7.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=7 at T=92, need at T=91 y=6,7,8.\n\ny=6 or 7 possible, but I can't be there.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=6 is at T=96, for example, if I go up every turn from start.\n\nT=90: y=0, U to y=1 T=91\n\nT=91: y=1, U to y=2 T=92 but dangerous, so I have to avoid that.\n\nSo I must be at y=0 at T=92.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nBut when I go up from y=0 at T=92, I can go to y=1 at T=93, which is safe since T=93>92, no danger.\n\nThen to y=2 at T=94, etc., up to y=6 at T=98, y=7 at T=99, y=8 at T=100, y=9 at T=101.\n\nT=92: y=0, U to y=1 T=93\n\nT=93: y=1, U to y=2 T=94\n\nT=94: y=2, U to y=3 T=95\n\nT=95: y=3, U to y=4 T=96\n\nT=96: y=4, U to y=5 T=97\n\nT=97: y=5, U to y=6 T=98\n\nT=98: y=6, U to y=7 T=99\n\nT=99: y=7, U to y=8 T=100\n\nT=100: y=8, U to y=9 T=101\n\nSo at T=101, y=9.\n\nActions from T=90 to T=100, 11 actions.\n\nH=11, reach at turn 90+11=101.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 after it is safe.\n\ny=8 is safe after T=91, so from T=92 on.\n\nSince y=6 and y=7 are safe, I can go there directly, but from y=0, it takes 6 steps to y=6.\n\nFor example, if I could be at y=6 at T=96, but with the detour, it's later.\n\nAnother idea: at T=90, I go up to y=1 at T=91.\n\nThen at T=91, I go up, but to y=2 at T=92 dangerous, so I can't.\n\nUnless I go to a row that is safe at T=92 from a different path.\n\nBut I can't.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to y=0 at T=91, but then at T=91 y=0, I can go U to y=1 at T=92, dangerous.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo I think the only way is to be at y=0 at T=92, then proceed.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can be on y=9 at T=92 or something, no.\n\nOr perhaps I can skip some rows later, but no, I have to move step by step.\n\nAnother thought: at T=90, I am at y=0, I can stay, but that doesn't help.\n\nOr, since y=8 is dangerous at T=90 and T=91, but I'm not there.\n\nBut for the path, I need to cross y=8 at some point.\n\nThe earliest I can be on y=8 is at T=92, since at T=91 it's dangerous, and at T=90 I'm at y=0.\n\nAt T=92, y=8 is safe.\n\nTo be at y=8 at T=92, I need to be at y=7,8,9 at T=91.\n\nBut at T=91, y=8 dangerous, y=9 not reachable, y=7 not reachable from start.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=8 at T=92.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=8 is at T=98 or something.\n\nFor example, from y=0 at T=92, go up to y=1 T=93, ..., y=8 at T=100.\n\nAs before.\n\nPerhaps from start, I go up to y=1 at T=91, then instead of down, I stay, but at T=92 y=1 dangerous.\n\nNo.\n\nI think I have to accept the detour.\n\nBut let's see the car on y=8.\n\ny=8 has a car that covers x=0 at T=90 and T=91.\n\nAt T=92, it is at [-11+12,12]= [1,12], not covering 0.\n\nSimilarly, other cars only at T=92 for 1-5.\n\nSo no other dangers.\n\nTherefore, the minimal way is to go to y=0 at T=92, then go up directly to y=9.\n\nTotal turns: start T=90 y=0.\n\nAfter two actions (U then D), at T=92 y=0.\n\nThen 9 actions up to y=9 at T=101.\n\nActions: at T=90: U\n\nT=91: D\n\nT=92: U\n\nT=93: U\n\n...\n\nUp to T=100: U to y=9 at T=101.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=90 to T=100, that's 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut from T=92 y=0 to T=101 y=9, 9 actions, but I have two actions before to get to y=0 at T=92.\n\nTotal 11.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10 or less?\n\nSuppose I can reach y=9 in 10 actions, so at turn 100.\n\nThen from y=0 at T=90 to y=9 at T=100, I need to increase y by 9 in 10 turns, so I must have 9 up and 1 stay or down, but down not helpful, so perhaps 9 up and 1 stay.\n\nBut with the danger, at T=92, I must not be on y=1-5.\n\nIf I go up directly, at T=92 I would be on y=2 if I start U at T=90.\n\nT=90: U to y1 T91\n\nT91: U to y2 T92 dangerous.\n\nIf I have a stay, for example:\n\nT90: U to y1 T91\n\nT91: S to y1 T92 dangerous.\n\nOr T90: S to y0 T91\n\nT91: U to y1 T92 dangerous.\n\nAlways at T=92 I am on y=1 or 2 if I move up.\n\nTo be on y=0 at T=92, I must have moved down at some point, which costs an extra move.\n\nFor example, in the path, I have a down move at T=91, from y=1 to y=0.\n\nSo I have one down move, which is extra, so total moves 11 for 9 net up.\n\nIf I can avoid the down, but I can't because of the danger.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=6 at T=92, but impossible.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach earlier by going to safe rows.\n\nFor example, from T=90 y=0, U to y1 T91\n\nThen at T91 y=1, I need to move to a safe row for T92, only y=0 possible, so D.\n\nThen at T92 y=0, U to y1 T93, etc.\n\nSame as before.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to y=7 or something, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 is always safe, I could go to y=6 quickly and wait there, but waiting might not help, and I need to go to y=9.\n\nBut to reach y=6, it takes 6 steps from y=0.\n\nFrom T=90 y=0, if I go up every turn, I can be at y=6 at T=96.\n\nBut at T=92, if I am on y=2, dangerous, so I cannot.\n\nThe only way to avoid T=92 danger is to be below or above, but above I can't reach.\n\nSo I must be at y=0 at T=92.\n\nThen from there, to y=6 at T=98, as before.\n\nI think it's inevitable.\n\nSo minimal H=11.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nStart: turn 90, position (0,0)\n\nAction a90: U\n\nThen at turn 91, y=1\n\nAction a91: D\n\nThen at turn 92, y=0\n\nAction a92: U\n\nTurn 93, y=1\n\nAction a93: U\n\nTurn 94, y=2\n\nAction a94: U\n\nTurn 95, y=3\n\nAction a95: U\n\nTurn 96, y=4\n\nAction a96: U\n\nTurn 97, y=5\n\nAction a97: U\n\nTurn 98, y=6\n\nAction a98: U\n\nTurn 99, y=7\n\nAction a99: U\n\nTurn 100, y=8\n\nAction a100: U\n\nTurn 101, y=9\n\nReached at turn 101.\n\nActions from turn 90 to 100.\n\nH=11 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at t=90 to t=100.\n\nAnswer should be the actions.\n\nIn the format: for each turn, the action.\n\nSince we start at t1=90, and go to t=90+H-1.\n\nHere H=11, so actions from turn 90 to turn 100.\n\nNow, in the sequence above, a90=U, a91=D, a92=U, a93=U, ..., a100=U.\n\nFrom a92 to a100 all U, except a91=D.\n\na93 to a100: U each.\n\nList:\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: D\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nTurn 93: U\n\nTurn 94: U\n\nTurn 95: U\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nTurn 100: U\n\nThen at turn 101, y=9.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nSuppose I go to y=8 directly after it is safe.\n\nBut to reach y=8, I need to go through lower rows.\n\nSince y=7 is always safe, I could be on y=7 at T=92, but impossible.\n\nAnother thought: at T=90, I go up to y=1 at T=91.\n\nThen at T=91, I go up to y=2 at T=92, but dangerous, so I can't.\n\nUnless the car is not there, but it is.\n\nPerhaps for y=3,4,5, but same.\n\nI think it's not possible.\n\nSo I believe H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions again.\n\nFor example, on freeway 8, at T=90 and T=91, dangerous.\n\nBut at T=92, safe.\n\nAnd rows 1-5 only dangerous at T=92.\n\nNo other times.\n\nSo yes.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 faster by not going down.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 for one turn.\n\nT90: S to y0 T91\n\nThen T91: y0, U to y1 T92 dangerous.\n\nNot good.\n\nT90: U to y1 T91\n\nT91: U to y2 T92 dangerous.\n\nNo.\n\nSo must have a down move or something to avoid.\n\nThus, minimal actions.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: D\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nTurn 93: U\n\nTurn 94: U\n\nTurn 95: U\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nTurn 100: U\n\nIn the action sequence, from t=90 to t=100.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut the player reaches at turn 101, which is 90+11.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut let's see if I can reduce by one.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=1 at T=91, then down to y=0 at T=92.\n\nThen at T=92, instead of going up immediately, but I need to go up.\n\nAfter T=92, all safe, so I can go directly.\n\nBut from y=0 to y=9, 9 moves, so minimum 9 turns after T=92.\n\nT=92 to T=101, 9 actions? From T=92 to T=101: action at T=92 to go to y=1 at T=93, ..., action at T=100 to go to y=9 at T=101.\n\nActions at T=92,93,...,100, 9 actions, but I have actions at T=90 and T=91 before, so total 11.\n\nIf I could start from higher, but no.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps at T=91, I can go to y=7 or something, but impossible.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from (0, 0) at turn 90 with the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8, the player must avoid being on rows y=1 to 5 at turn 92 (since these rows are dangerous only at this turn) and avoid row y=8 at turns 90 and 91 (since it is dangerous at these turns). Rows y=6 and y=7 are always safe, and rows y=0 and y=9 are safe as they are not freeways.\n\nGiven the constraints:\n- At turn 90, the player is at y=0 (safe).\n- Moving up to y=1 at turn 91 is safe, as y=1 is not dangerous at turn 91.\n- However, from y=1 at turn 91, moving up or staying would place the player on y=2 or y=1 at turn 92, both dangerous. The only safe action is to move down to y=0 at turn 92.\n- At turn 92, y=0 is safe. From there, the player can move up directly to y=9 without further obstacles, as all rows are safe after turn 92.\n\nThis path requires 11 actions (H=11), with the player reaching y=9 at turn 101. The sequence of actions is:\n- Turn 90: U (move to y=1 at turn 91)\n- Turn 91: D (move to y=0 at turn 92)\n- Turn 92: U (move to y=1 at turn 93)\n- Turn 93: U (move to y=2 at turn 94)\n- Turn 94: U (move to y=3 at turn 95)\n- Turn 95: U (move to y=4 at turn 96)\n- Turn 96: U (move to y=5 at turn 97)\n- Turn 97: U (move to y=6 at turn 98)\n- Turn 98: U (move to y=7 at turn 99)\n- Turn 99: U (move to y=8 at turn 100)\n- Turn 100: U (move to y=9 at turn 101)\n\nThis sequence minimizes H while avoiding all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 90: U \\\\\nTurn 91: D \\\\\nTurn 92: U \\\\\nTurn 93: U \\\\\nTurn 94: U \\\\\nTurn 95: U \\\\\nTurn 96: U \\\\\nTurn 97: U \\\\\nTurn 98: U \\\\\nTurn 99: U \\\\\nTurn 100: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 92. The player starts at (0,0) and needs to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The grid has freeways at y=1 to y=8, each with cars moving either left or right.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) at that turn and the car's span at that turn includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nNote: When the player moves from y to y' at turn T, at turn T the player is still on y, and only at turn T+1 will the player be on y'. Therefore, when moving from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T the player is on y, and at turn T+1 the player is on y+1.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions from turn 92 to turn 92+H-1 such that at the end the player is at (0,9).\n\nWe note that the player must move from y=0 to y=9. The minimal number of moves without any cars would be 9 moves (each U). However, we have to avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe need to simulate the car positions at future turns. The cars move at constant speeds and in fixed directions.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t0 = 92.\n\nFor a car on a freeway at time t (relative to t0, so absolute turn = t0 + t), the car's span is computed as:\n\nFor left-moving car: initial head h and tail tau at t0. Then at time T (absolute turn) = t0 + t, the span is:\n  [h - s * t, tau - s * t]\n\nFor right-moving car: initial head h and tail tau at t0. Then at time T (absolute turn) = t0 + t, the span is:\n  [tau + s * t, h + s * t]\n\nBut note: the representation for right-moving is given as (head, tail) but in the update it says for right: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t0), h + s*(T-t0)]. However, the input for right-moving cars is given as (head, tail) and from the example we see that for a right-moving car, the head is the larger number? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning that the tail is the left end and head is the right end? But in the input for the right-moving cars, we have for example: (36, 25, right, 12). This is confusing.\n\nLet me clarify from the update rule:\n\nFor a right-moving car, the initial span at t0 is given as [tau, h] meaning the car extends from tau to h (with tau <= h). Then at time T, it moves to [tau + s*(T-t0), h + s*(T-t0)].\n\nBut in the input, the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving cars, the head is the leading part? Actually, the update rule for right-moving says: \"Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t0), h + s*(T-t0)]\", meaning that the entire car moves to the right. And the initial span at t0 is [tau, h]. So in the input, the tuple (h, tau, d, s) for a right-moving car actually gives head = h and tail = tau, and then the initial span is [tau, h]. Therefore, we must interpret the input accordingly.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: the input tuple (h, tau, left, s) and the initial span is [h, tau] (but note: the update says \"Span(t1) = [h, tau] and then becomes [h - s*(T-t0), tau - s*(T-t0)]\". However, for a left-moving car, typically the head is the leftmost? But the update rule does not specify which is larger. Actually, in the example for left-moving: (-24,11,left,36). This implies that at t0, the car spans from -24 to 11? But that would be a length of 35? Actually, the update rule for left-moving: the car moves left, so the head should be the leftmost? But the update says the head at t0 is at -24 and tail at 11, meaning the car extends from -24 to 11? Then the head is at -24 and tail at 11? That doesn't make sense because as the car moves left, the head becomes more negative. Actually, the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and then it moves to [h - s*(T-t0), tau - s*(T-t0)]. So the initial span is [h, tau] meaning the car covers from h to tau. But if h < tau, then the car would be from h to tau? And then when it moves left, both h and tau decrease.\n\nBut in the example for left-moving: (-24,11,left,36). Here h=-24, tau=11, so the car spans from -24 to 11? That's a length of 35? Then when moving left, at time t, the car spans from -24-36t to 11-36t.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: (36,25,right,12) -> initial span [25,36] (because for right-moving the initial span is [tau, h] and the input gives (head, tail) as (36,25) meaning head=36, tail=25? Then the initial span is [25,36]. Then at time t, it becomes [25+12t, 36+12t].\n\nBut wait, the input for the right-moving cars also has (0,-11,right,12). Then the initial span would be [-11,0]? Because tau=-11 and head=0. Then at time t, it becomes [-11+12t, 0+12t].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: (-24,11,left,36) -> initial span [-24,11]. Then at time t, it becomes [-24-36t, 11-36t].\n\nNow, the collision condition: at turn T (absolute turn = 92 + t, where t is the number of turns from now), if the player is on freeway k (so y = k, which is between 1 and 8) and there is a car on freeway k such that the car's span at time T includes 0.\n\nNote: The player is at (0, y) at turn T.\n\nWe need to plan the moves so that when the player is on a freeway row at a particular turn, there is no car on that freeway at that turn that covers x=0.\n\nThe player starts at y0 = 0 at turn 92 (t=0). We are to choose actions for t=0,1,...,H-1 (so H actions) such that at the end the player is at y=9.\n\nThe state of the player: at turn t (relative to 92, so absolute turn 92+t), the player is at y_t.\n\nThe actions: U -> y_{t+1} = y_t + 1\n          D -> y_{t+1} = y_t - 1\n          S -> y_{t+1} = y_t\n\nConstraints: y_t must be in [0,9].\n\nGoal: find the minimal H and a sequence such that after H moves (so at turn 92+H-1) the player is at 9? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then at the end we have turn t1 + H - 1, and we want y_{t1+H-1}=9. So the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and the state at that turn is 9.\n\nBut note: the player moves at each turn. So the state at turn t1 (t=0) is the initial state. Then we apply action a_{t1} (which is the first action) to get state at turn t1+1, and so on.\n\nSo if we take H actions, we end at turn t1+H. But wait, the problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning that we have actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the state at turn t1+H is the state after H actions. However, we want the player to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\" and then \"at turn t1+H-1: ... such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nBut note: the actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the state at turn t1+H is determined by the last action? Actually, the state at turn t1 is the initial state (0,0). Then:\n\n- At turn t1: we take action a_{t1} -> this moves to state at turn t1+1.\n- At turn t1+1: we take action a_{t1+1} -> state at turn t1+2.\n- ...\n- At turn t1+H-1: we take action a_{t1+H-1} -> state at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: we want the player to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? That would be the state after H-1 actions. That doesn't match.\n\nLooking back: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we have the state at the end of the sequence is at turn t1+H-1? Actually, the state at the end of the sequence is at turn t1+H? Because we start at t1 and take H actions, so the last state is at t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nLet me check the problem statement: \n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nIt says: \"at turn t1+H-1\". So we want the player to be at (0,9) at the turn that is H-1 steps after t1? That means after H-1 actions? \n\nBut the sequence has H actions? That doesn't match. Actually, the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions. Then the state after H actions is at turn t1+H. But we want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". How is that achieved?\n\nLet me index the state: \n- At turn t1 (absolute): state y0 = 0.\n- After action a_{t1} (at turn t1) we get state at turn t1+1: y1.\n- After action a_{t1+1} (at turn t1+1) we get state at turn t1+2: y2.\n- ...\n- After action a_{t1+H-1} (at turn t1+H-1) we get state at turn t1+H: y_H.\n\nBut we want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9? That would be y_{H-1} = 9.\n\nBut the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1? Then the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state BEFORE the last action? \n\nActually, the state at a turn is the state at the beginning of the turn. Then during the turn, we take an action that moves to the next state at the next turn.\n\nSo:\n- At the beginning of turn t1: state y = 0.\n- During turn t1: we take action a_{t1}, which moves to state at the beginning of turn t1+1: y1.\n\nSimilarly, at the beginning of turn t1+1: state y1, then during turn t1+1: action a_{t1+1} moves to state at turn t1+2: y2.\n\nTherefore, we want the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 to be 9? That would be the state at the beginning of that turn, and then we take an action at that turn? But we don't require to hold at 9 for multiple turns? The problem just says \"reach (0,9)\".\n\nBut note: the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is 9. And then we don't care what happens after? Actually, the problem does not say we have to stay there, but we only require to be there at that turn.\n\nHowever, the sequence of actions is from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1 (H actions). But if at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are already at 9, then the action at turn t1+H-1 could be anything? But note: we are only required to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\nBut wait: if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then during that turn we take an action. If we take U, we would go to 10, which is invalid. If we take D, we go to 8. If we take S, we stay at 9. So to not invalidate the state, we must take S or D? But the problem says we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, meaning at the beginning of the turn. And then we take an action? But the goal is achieved at the beginning of the turn? So we don't care about the action at that turn? Actually, the problem says: we are to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is 9. Then we take an action that might move us away? But that doesn't matter because we only require to be there at that turn.\n\nHowever, the problem also says: the sequence of actions is until we have reached. So we can stop at the action that gets us to 9? But note: the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, and the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state at the beginning of that turn. We want that state to be 9.\n\nHow did we get to that state? The action at turn t1+H-2 (the previous turn) is what moved us to 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of actions has H actions, but the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is taken when we are already at 9? And that action might move us away? But the problem does not require to stay at 9, only to be there at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nHowever, note that the minimal H is the minimal number of turns from the start (turn t1) to the turn when we are at 9 (turn t1+H-1). So H is the number of actions, and the time when we are at 9 is after H-1 actions? Actually, the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is the result of H-1 actions? \n\nLet me clarify with H=1:\n  Sequence: one action at turn t1: a_{t1}. Then the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 = t1+0 is the initial state 0. We want that to be 9? No.\n\nFor H=10:\n  We have actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+9.\n  The state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 = t1+9 is the state after 9 actions? Because:\n    After action at t1: state at t1+1 -> after 1 action\n    ...\n    After action at t1+8: state at t1+9 -> after 9 actions.\n\n  Then we take the 10th action at turn t1+9 to move to state at t1+10.\n\nBut we want the state at the beginning of turn t1+9 to be 9. That state is the result of 9 actions.\n\nTherefore, we need to reach y=9 in 9 moves? But note that from 0 to 9, we need at least 9 moves (each U). So H-1 = 9? Then H = 10.\n\nBut wait: the minimal H might be more if we have to avoid cars? So we might need to wait (use S) sometimes.\n\nSo the state at the beginning of turn t1+t (for t from 0 to H-1) is y_t.\n\nWe need y_{H-1} = 9.\n\nAnd we have H actions: from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nNow, the collision condition: at the beginning of turn t1+t, we are at y_t. Then during the turn, we take an action. But the collision check is at the beginning of the turn? Actually, the problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\".\n\nAnd note: at turn T, the player is at (0, y_T). So at the beginning of turn T, we are at y_T. And if y_T is between 1 and 8, then we check the cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nTherefore, for each turn t (from 0 to H-1), at the beginning of turn t1+t, we are at y_t. We must not be in collision at that turn.\n\nBut note: when we are at y_t = 0 or 9, we are not on a freeway (freeways are 1-8), so no collision check.\n\nSo we only check for y_t in [1,8].\n\nNow, we need to simulate the cars for each freeway and for each turn.\n\nWe are at turn t0 = 92.\n\nWe are going to simulate for future turns t (relative to t0): so at absolute turn = 92 + t.\n\nWe need to check for each freeway k (1-8) and for each car on that freeway, whether at absolute turn 92+t, the car's span includes 0.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway and for each turn t (from 0 up to a maximum, say 20) whether that freeway is blocked at 0.\n\nThen we plan a path from y0=0 to y_{H-1}=9 with minimal H (which is the number of actions, and H-1 is the number of moves? Actually, the state at step t is after t actions? Actually, we have:\n\n- t=0: state at turn 92: y0=0\n- t=1: state at turn 93: y1 = y0 + a0\n- ...\n- t: state at turn 92+t: y_t\n\nWe want y_{H-1}=9.\n\nSo we are looking for the minimal H such that there exists a sequence of actions (each in {U, D, S}) that leads from y0=0 to y_{H-1}=9 without any collision at any turn from 0 to H-2? Actually, we must avoid collision at every turn from 0 to H-1? But at turn 0: we are at y0=0, which is not a freeway -> safe. At turn H-1: we are at y_{H-1}=9 -> safe. So we only care about turns 1 to H-2? Actually, we must avoid collision at every turn when we are at a freeway (y in [1,8]) at the beginning of the turn.\n\nSo for each turn t (from 0 to H-1), we are at y_t. For t=0: y0=0 -> safe. For t=H-1: if we are at 9, safe. For t from 1 to H-2 (if H>=3) we are at y_t which might be between 1 and 8, and we must check that freeway at turn 92+t.\n\nBut note: at the beginning of turn 92+t, we are at y_t. Then we take an action that moves us to y_{t+1} at the next turn.\n\nWe can model this as a graph search (BFS or Dijkstra) in state (y, t) where t is the number of turns elapsed (so absolute turn = 92+t). We start at (0,0) and we want to reach (9, T) for some T (which will be H-1, and then H = T+1? because we have T+1 actions: from t=0 to t=T, then the state at turn T is the result of T actions? Actually, we have:\n\n- We are at (y, t) meaning at absolute turn 92+t, we are at y.\n- Then we choose an action, which leads to (y', t+1) at turn 92+t+1.\n\nWe want to find a path from (0,0) to (9, T) for some T (which will be H-1, and then H = T+1? because the number of actions is T? because we start at t=0 and take an action at each turn until t=T-1? Actually, no:\n\n- At turn 92+0: we are at (0,0). Then we take an action (at turn 92+0) to go to turn 92+1: state y1.\n- Then at turn 92+1: we are at y1, then take action to go to turn 92+2: y2.\n- ...\n- To get to (9, T): we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn 92+T. This is the state after T actions? \n\nBut the actions we take are at turns 92+0, 92+1, ..., 92+T-1. So we take T actions to get to state at turn 92+T? But we want to be at 9 at turn 92+T? Then the number of actions is T, and the turn we are at 9 is 92+T. Then the problem says we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. Here t1=92, so 92+T = 92+H-1 => T = H-1.\n\nBut we have taken T = H-1 actions? Then the number of actions is H-1? But the problem says the sequence has H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1. This is confusing.\n\nLet me redefine:\n\nLet H be the number of actions. Then the sequence is for turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThe state at the beginning of turn t1 is y0=0.\n\nAfter the first action (at turn t1), we are at state y1 at turn t1+1.\n\n...\n\nAfter the H-th action (at turn t1+H-1), we are at state y_H at turn t1+H.\n\nBut we want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9. So we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at state y_{H-1}. We require y_{H-1}=9.\n\nHow many actions have been taken to get to y_{H-1}? We have taken H-1 actions (from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2). Then at turn t1+H-1, we are at state y_{H-1}=9, and then we take the H-th action (at turn t1+H-1) to go to state y_H at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem only requires to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. So we don't care about y_H? And we must provide H actions? Even the last action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut the goal is achieved at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, so why do we need to take an action at that turn? The problem says: \"a sequence of actions for t=0 to H-1\", meaning we take H actions. But if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we can choose an action arbitrarily? However, the action must be such that the next state is in [0,9]. If we are at 9, we can only choose D or S (because U would go to 10, which is invalid). But the problem doesn't say we have to stay, but the action must be chosen so that the state remains in [0,9]. So we can choose S.\n\nTherefore, we can plan a path that gets us to 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we set the last action to S.\n\nBut note: we might get to 9 earlier and then stay? But the minimal H is the minimal such H.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that the state 9 at turn t1+H-1 is achieved by H-1 actions? Then the last action (the H-th) is taken at turn t1+H-1 and we are already at 9? And we choose S.\n\nSo the minimal H will be the minimal T+1 where T is the number of turns after which we are at 9 (at turn 92+T), and then we set the last action to S? But wait, if we are at 9 at turn 92+T, then we are at 9 at the beginning of turn 92+T, and then we take an action at that turn. So the sequence of actions includes that last action. So the number of actions is T+1? Because we started at turn 92 and took actions at 92,93,...,92+T.\n\nBut we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn 92+T. Then the actions taken are from turn 92 to turn 92+T-1 (T actions) to get to state at turn 92+T. But then we are at state at turn 92+T, which is after T actions, and we want that state to be 9? But the problem wants to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 92+H-1.\n\nSo if we are at 9 at turn 92+T, then we set H-1 = T => H = T+1.\n\nBut then the number of actions is H = T+1. However, we only need T actions to get to 9 at turn 92+T. Then the last action (the T+1-th) would be at turn 92+T, and then we move to state at 92+T+1. But the problem requires to be at 9 at turn 92+H-1 = 92+T (because H=T+1). And that state is achieved by the first T actions.\n\nSo the last action (at turn 92+T) is taken when we are already at 9? And we can set it to S.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\n  We want to achieve state 9 at turn 92+T for some T (the minimal T). Then we set H = T+1, and the actions are the actions that get us to 9 in T actions (which are taken at turns 92 to 92+T-1) and then at turn 92+T we take action S.\n\nBut then the state at turn 92+T is 9 (because we were at 9 at the beginning and we take S to stay). And then the next state at 92+T+1 is also 9, but we don't care.\n\nHowever, the problem only requires to be at 9 at turn 92+T (which is t1+H-1 = 92+(T+1)-1 = 92+T). And we are there at the beginning of the turn. Then we take action S, which is valid.\n\nSo the minimal T is the minimal number of turns after which we can be at 9 (at the beginning of turn 92+T). Then H = T+1.\n\nBut note: the initial state is at turn 92: we are at 0. So if T=0, then at turn 92 we are at 0, not 9. So T must be at least 9.\n\nWe can do a BFS over (y, t) where t is the number of turns elapsed (so absolute turn = 92+t), and y is the current row.\n\nWe start at (0,0) and we want to reach (9,T) for some T.\n\nThe actions: U, D, S. But with constraints: y must be in [0,9] after the move? Actually, when we take an action, we compute the next state: \n  y' = y + dy, and we require 0<=y'<=9.\n\nThe cost is the number of actions? But we are counting T (the time) and we want minimal T? But we want minimal H = T+1, and T is the time when we first reach 9. So we want minimal T such that we can be at 9 at time T.\n\nBut note: we might have to wait sometimes, so T might be greater than 9.\n\nWe do BFS (since all actions cost 1) over states (y, t) for t from 0 up to a safe bound (say 20).\n\nAt each state (y, t), we consider the next action leading to (y', t+1).\n\nBut we must not be in collision at state (y, t) if y is in [1,8]. So when we are at (y,t), we check if y is in [1,8] and if at absolute turn 92+t, freeway y has a car covering 0.\n\nIf there is a car covering 0 on freeway y at turn 92+t, then we cannot be at (y,t).\n\nSo the state (y,t) is valid only if either y is 0 or 9 or y in [1,8] and no car on freeway y at turn 92+t covers 0.\n\nThen we start from (0,0) and we want to reach (9,T) for the smallest T.\n\nOnce we find the minimal T such that there is a path to (9,T), then we set H = T+1, and the actions are the sequence to get to (9,T) (which is T actions) and then we add one more action at turn 92+T: which is S.\n\nBut wait: in the BFS, we are at (9,T) at the beginning of turn 92+T. Then we don't need to take an action to stay? The problem requires H actions. The actions we took to get to (9,T) are the actions at turns 92 to 92+T-1 (T actions). Then we must provide one more action at turn 92+T? But we are already at the goal at the beginning of turn 92+T. So we can take any valid action at that turn? We take S.\n\nTherefore, the total actions are T (to get to (9,T)) and then the T+1-th action is S at turn 92+T.\n\nBut then the state at turn 92+T+1 is still 9, but we don't care.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that the goal is reached at (9,T), and then we output the sequence of T actions (to get to (9,T)) and then we don't output the next action? But the problem says we must output H actions, and H = T+1.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, t1+H-1 = 92 + (T+1) - 1 = 92+T. And at the beginning of turn 92+T, we are at 9. So it matches.\n\nSo we need to find the minimal T such that we can be at 9 at the beginning of turn 92+T, and then we set H = T+1, and the actions are the ones that got us from 0 to 9 in T actions (which are for turns 92 to 92+T-1) and then the last action at turn 92+T is S.\n\nBut we can also reach 9 earlier and then wait? But that would increase T? We want minimal T.\n\nTherefore, we do BFS for states (y,t) for t=0,1,2,... until we find (9,T).\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Precomputation: for each freeway k (1-8) and for each turn t (from 0 to, say, 20), determine if freeway k is blocked at turn 92+t.\n\n   Blocked if there is at least one car on freeway k that covers 0 at turn 92+t.\n\n   How to check for one car:\n\n   For a car on freeway k with initial (h, tau, d, s) at turn 92:\n\n   - If d = 'left': \n        span at turn t: [h - s*t, tau - s*t]\n        blocked if: h - s*t <= 0 <= tau - s*t   ??? But note: if h < tau, then the span is [h - s*t, tau - s*t] and we require 0 to be in that interval: h - s*t <= 0 <= tau - s*t.\n\n   But in the example: for left-moving car (-24,11,left,36): \n        at t=0: [-24,11] -> 0 is between -24 and 11 -> blocked at t=0? But freeway 1 and 2 have this car? But we are at turn 92, and the player is at y=0 at turn 92, so freeway 1 is not checked at turn 92? Only when the player is on freeway 1.\n\n   However, we need to precompute for all freeways and all t.\n\n   But note: the input for freeway k only has the cars on that freeway.\n\n   For freeway 1: car (-24,11,left,36) -> at turn t (relative to 92), the span is [-24 - 36t, 11 - 36t]. \n        We need: -24 - 36t <= 0 <= 11 - 36t.\n\n        Let's solve: \n          0 >= -24 - 36t -> always true for t>=0.\n          0 <= 11 - 36t -> 36t <= 11 -> t <= 11/36 < 1 -> so only at t=0? \n\n        At t=0: 0 in [-24,11] -> yes, blocked.\n\n        At t=1: [-24-36, 11-36] = [-60, -25] -> 0 not in there.\n\n        So freeway 1 is blocked only at t=0.\n\n   Similarly, freeway 2: same car -> blocked only at t=0.\n\n   Freeway 3,4,5: each has three cars: \n        (-48, -59, right, 12) -> but wait: this is right-moving? And the input is (head, tail) = (-48,-59). For right-moving, the initial span is [tail, head] = [-59, -48]. Then at turn t: [-59+12t, -48+12t].\n\n        When is 0 in [-59+12t, -48+12t]? \n           -59+12t <= 0 <= -48+12t\n           => 12t <= 59 -> t <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916 -> t<=4\n           and 12t >= 48 -> t>=4\n           so t=4: \n                at t=4: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? But the interval is [a,b] and 0 is the right endpoint? The problem says \"covers 0\", so if 0 is at the endpoint, it is covered.\n\n        So at t=4: blocked.\n\n        Also, (36,25,right,12): initial span [25,36] -> at turn t: [25+12t, 36+12t]. \n          0 in [25+12t, 36+12t]? \n          25+12t <= 0 <= 36+12t -> \n          first: 12t <= -25 -> t negative -> never.\n\n        And (0,-11,right,12): initial span [-11,0] -> at turn t: [-11+12t, 0+12t] = [-11+12t, 12t].\n          0 in this? \n          -11+12t <= 0 <= 12t -> \n          from 0<=12t -> t>=0\n          and -11+12t<=0 -> 12t<=11 -> t<=0.916 -> so t=0: [-11,0] -> 0 is included? yes.\n\n        Therefore, for freeway 3,4,5:\n          t=0: blocked by the car (0,-11,right,12) -> blocked.\n          t=4: blocked by the car (-48,-59,right,12) -> blocked.\n\n        Other t? \n          For the car (0,-11,right,12): at t=1: [-11+12, 12] = [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n          t=2: [13,24] -> no.\n          The car (36,25,right,12): never.\n          The car (-48,-59,right,12): only at t=4? \n                t=3: [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12] -> no 0.\n                t=4: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> includes 0.\n\n   Freeway 6,7: one car (60,49,right,6): \n        initial span [49,60]? For right: [tau, head] = [49,60]. Then at turn t: [49+6t, 60+6t]. \n        0 in [49+6t, 60+6t]? \n          49+6t <=0 -> t negative -> never blocked.\n\n   Freeway 8: two cars: (60,49,right,6) and (12,1,right,6)\n        (60,49,right,6): same as above -> never blocked.\n        (12,1,right,6): initial span [1,12] -> at turn t: [1+6t,12+6t]. \n          0 in [1+6t,12+6t]? \n          1+6t<=0 -> t negative -> never.\n\n        So freeway 8 is never blocked.\n\n   Summary for freeways (for t from 0 to 20):\n\n   Freeway 1: blocked at t=0.\n   Freeway 2: blocked at t=0.\n   Freeway 3: blocked at t=0,4.\n   Freeway 4: blocked at t=0,4.\n   Freeway 5: blocked at t=0,4.\n   Freeway 6: never\n   Freeway 7: never\n   Freeway 8: never\n\n   Note: we only care for t>=0.\n\n2. BFS:\n\n   We'll do BFS over (y, t) for t from 0 to 20, and y from 0 to 9.\n\n   We start at (0,0). We want to reach (9,T) for minimal T.\n\n   The actions: U, D, S -> lead to (y+1, t+1), (y-1, t+1), (y, t+1) respectively, provided that the next state is valid.\n\n   The next state (y_next, t_next) is valid if:\n        - 0<=y_next<=9\n        - if y_next is in [1,8], then at turn 92+t_next, freeway y_next must not be blocked.\n\n   But note: the state (y, t) itself must be valid? Actually, we start at (0,0) which is valid. Then when we generate the next state, we check the next state.\n\n   However, the current state (y,t) might be invalid if y in [1,8] and blocked at turn 92+t? But we only generate states that are not blocked? Actually, we avoid going to a blocked state.\n\n   Algorithm:\n\n      Let dist[y][t] = minimal number of actions to reach (y,t) (or we don't need the number, we just want to know if we can reach and the path)\n\n      We use a queue: (y, t, path) or we store parent pointers.\n\n      We start: (0,0) with empty path.\n\n      Then for each state (y,t), we consider the three actions.\n\n      The next state is:\n\n          U: (y+1, t+1)\n          D: (y-1, t+1)\n          S: (y, t+1)\n\n      And we check that the next state is within [0,9] and if the y_next is in [1,8] then we check the block status for freeway y_next at turn 92+(t+1) (absolute turn = 92+t+1) is not blocked.\n\n      But note: the collision check for the next state is at the beginning of turn 92+t+1? Yes, because at the beginning of turn 92+t+1, we are at y_next.\n\n      However, we are only checking the next state: we don't care about the current state? Actually, the current state (y,t) we already know is valid because we only enqueue valid states.\n\n      Steps:\n\n        Initialize: \n            queue: (0,0) with path [].\n            visited[0][0] = true.\n\n        While queue not empty:\n            pop state (y,t) and the path so far.\n\n            If (y,t) is (9,?): then we are done? But we want to reach (9,T) for any T? and we want minimal T.\n\n            But we are doing BFS by t (time), so the first time we hit y=9, that T is minimal.\n\n            Then we break and record the path and T.\n\n            Then H = T+1, and the action sequence = path (which has T actions) and then we add one more action: S at the end.\n\n            But note: the path we record is the actions taken to get to (9,T). How many actions? T actions: because we started at t=0, and after T actions we are at time T.\n\n            Then we need to add the T+1-th action? \n\n            Actually, the path we have is the sequence of actions taken at turns 92 to 92+T-1 to get to (9,T) at turn 92+T. Then we add action S at turn 92+T.\n\n            So the full sequence: the path of T actions, then an S.\n\n        If we don't break, we generate the next states.\n\n        For each action a in {U, D, S}:\n\n            if a=U: y_next = y+1\n            if a=D: y_next = y-1\n            if a=S: y_next = y\n\n            t_next = t+1\n\n            If y_next not in [0,9]: skip.\n\n            If y_next in [1,8] and at turn 92+t_next, freeway y_next is blocked: skip.\n\n            Otherwise, if we haven't visited (y_next, t_next), then push it with path + [a].\n\n        We do this for t up to a limit, say 20.\n\n3. After BFS, we get the minimal T and the path (actions for the first T actions).\n\n   Then we output:\n\n        Turn 92: a0\n        Turn 93: a1\n        ...\n        Turn 92+T-1: a_{T-1}\n        Turn 92+T: S   [the last action]\n\n   And H = T+1.\n\nBut note: the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, so the last action is at turn 92+H-1 = 92+T.\n\nNow, let's run BFS.\n\nWe note the block status for each freeway and each t (relative to 92) for t from 0 to 20.\n\nWe have:\n\n  t: from 0 to 20.\n\n  Freeway 1: blocked at t=0 -> so at turn 92+0=92, freeway1 is blocked. But we are at (y,t): we only check the next state? Actually, when we generate a next state (y_next, t_next), we check at turn 92+t_next.\n\n  For the initial state (0,0): we generate next states for t_next=1.\n\n  So for t_next=1:\n\n      freeway1: not blocked (because only t=0 blocked) -> so we can go to freeway1 at t_next=1? \n\n  Similarly, for freeway3: blocked at t=0 and t=4. So at t_next=1: not blocked? at t_next=4: blocked? \n\n  Precomputed block status for freeway k at time t (relative to 92) for t=0 to 20:\n\n      f1: [0] -> only t=0\n      f2: [0]\n      f3: [0,4]\n      f4: [0,4]\n      f5: [0,4]\n      f6: none\n      f7: none\n      f8: none\n\n  So for a state (y,t_next) at time t_next, we check if y is in [1,8] and if t_next is in the blocked list for that freeway.\n\n  Now BFS:\n\n      t=0: (0,0) -> valid.\n\n      From (0,0): we can go to:\n\n          U: (1,1) -> check: freeway1 at t=1: not blocked -> valid. So we push (1,1) with path [\"U\"].\n          D: (0-1=-1) -> invalid.\n          S: (0,1) -> then at turn 92+1, we are at 0 -> not a freeway -> valid. Push (0,1) with path [\"S\"].\n\n      Now, we have two states: (1,1) and (0,1).\n\n      Next: we consider the smallest t? We do BFS by time.\n\n      t=1:\n\n          state (1,1): \n                Actions:\n                  U: (2,2) -> freeway2 at t=2: not blocked (only t=0) -> valid.\n                  D: (0,2) -> valid (not freeway).\n                  S: (1,2) -> freeway1 at t=2: not blocked -> valid.\n\n          state (0,1):\n                Actions:\n                  U: (1,2) -> freeway1 at t=2: not blocked -> valid. But we already have (1,2) from above? But we might get multiple ways, we want minimal time? We are doing BFS and we want the first time we hit 9. So we mark visited per (y,t).\n                  D: (-1) invalid.\n                  S: (0,2) -> valid.\n\n      So we have: \n          (2,2): from (1,1) with U -> path [\"U\",\"U\"]\n          (0,2): from (1,1) with D -> path [\"U\",\"D\"] and from (0,1) with S -> path [\"S\",\"S\"] and from (0,1) with U -> then S? Actually, from (0,1): U gives (1,2) and then from (0,1): S gives (0,2). And from (1,1): D gives (0,2). And from (1,1): U gives (2,2), and from (1,1): S gives (1,2).\n\n      We need to avoid duplicates: if we have visited (y,t), we don't push again.\n\n      We'll use a visited array for (y,t) for y in [0,9] and t in [0,20].\n\n      We continue until we reach (9,T).\n\n      We want minimal T.\n\n      The minimal T without any blocking is 9: we go up 9 times. But we have to check if that path is blocked.\n\n      Let's try the straight path: 9 consecutive U.\n\n          t0: (0,0) -> valid.\n          t1: (1,1) -> freeway1 at t=1: not blocked -> valid.\n          t2: (2,2) -> freeway2 at t=2: not blocked -> valid.\n          t3: (3,3) -> freeway3 at t=3: not blocked? because freeway3 blocked at t=0 and 4 -> so t=3 is safe -> valid.\n          t4: (4,4) -> freeway4 at t=4: blocked! -> so we cannot go to (4,4).\n\n      Therefore, we cannot go to freeway4 at t=4.\n\n      So we must avoid being at freeway4 at turn 92+4.\n\n      We can wait at some row to avoid being at freeway4 at t=4.\n\n      How about: \n          t0: U -> (1,1)\n          t1: U -> (2,2)\n          t2: S -> (2,3)   [wait at row2 at t=3]\n          t3: U -> (3,4)   [then at t=4, we are at row3: freeway3 at t=4: blocked? yes, freeway3 is blocked at t=4 -> so invalid]\n\n      Alternatively, at t=3, instead of going to 3, we go to 4? But that is blocked.\n\n      Or we wait longer? \n\n      We can go:\n\n          t0: U -> (1,1)\n          t1: U -> (2,2)\n          t2: U -> (3,3)  [safe at t=3: freeway3 not blocked at t=3]\n          t3: S -> (3,4)  [at t=4: freeway3 is blocked -> collision]\n\n          t3: D -> (2,4)  [freeway2 at t=4: not blocked -> safe? freeway2 only blocked at t=0 -> so safe]\n\n          Then at t4: we are at row2. Then we can go up again.\n\n          So: \n            t0: U\n            t1: U\n            t2: U\n            t3: D -> back to 2 at t4.\n            Then we have to go up to 9: from 2 to 9: 7 moves? so total moves: 3 (to 3) + 1 (down) + 7 (up) = 11? and then at the end we are at 9 at t0+11? then T=11, and we need to add one more action? So total H=12.\n\n          But we want minimal T.\n\n      Alternatively, we might avoid freeway4 at t=4 by being at a different row at t=4.\n\n      How about:\n\n          t0: U (1,1)\n          t1: U (2,2)\n          t2: U (3,3)\n          t3: U (4,4) -> blocked, so skip.\n\n          t2: from (2,2) we do S -> (2,3) [at t3: freeway2 at t=3: safe]\n          then at t3: we can go U to (3,4) -> freeway3 at t=4: blocked -> no.\n          or S -> (2,4) -> freeway2 at t=4: safe -> then at t4: we are at 2.\n\n          Then we need to go up from 2 to 9: 7 moves? but then we are at 9 at t=4+7=11? and then we add the last action? so T=11, H=12.\n\n      Another idea: go faster at the beginning? \n\n          t0: U (1,1)\n          t1: U (2,2)\n          t2: U (3,3)\n          t3: U (4,4) -> blocked, so skip.\n\n      Or go slower:\n\n          t0: S -> (0,1)\n          t1: U -> (1,2) [freeway1 at t=2: safe]\n          t2: U -> (2,3) [freeway2 at t=3: safe]\n          t3: U -> (3,4) [freeway3 at t=4: blocked] -> not safe.\n\n          t0: U (1,1)\n          t1: S (1,2) [freeway1 at t=2: safe]\n          t2: U (2,3) [freeway2 at t=3: safe]\n          t3: U (3,4) [freeway3 at t=4: blocked] -> not safe.\n\n      We must avoid freeway3,4,5 at t=4? but we also have to avoid freeway1,2 at t=0? but we are not there at t=0.\n\n      How about:\n\n          We wait at row 0 until t=1? \n          t0: S -> (0,1)\n          t1: U -> (1,2) [freeway1 at t=2: safe]\n          t2: U -> (2,3) [freeway2 at t=3: safe]\n          t3: U -> (3,4) [freeway3 at t=4: blocked] -> not safe.\n\n      Or wait until t=5? \n\n          We want to be at freeway4 at t=5? which is safe? \n\n          freeway4: blocked at t=0 and 4 -> so at t=5, not blocked.\n\n          So if we can avoid being at freeway4 at t=4, and then go through freeway4 at t=5, that is safe.\n\n          How?\n\n          We start: \n            t0: U -> (1,1)  [t1: freeway1 safe]\n            t1: U -> (2,2)  [safe]\n            t2: U -> (3,3)  [safe]\n            t3: we cannot go to 4 (because at t4 we are at 4 and t4=4 is blocked). So we wait at 3: \n                t3: S -> (3,4) -> but at t4 we are at 3? no: \n                    At the beginning of turn 92+3: we are at 3. Then we take S -> then at the beginning of turn 92+4, we are still at 3 -> freeway3 at t4: blocked! -> so we are blocked.\n\n          Alternatively, we go down at t3: \n                t3: D -> (2,4) [freeway2 at t4: safe] -> so we are safe at t4.\n\n          Then at t4: we are at 2. Then we need to go from 2 to 9: 7 moves. That would be at t4+7 = t11.\n\n          So we reach 9 at t=11? Then H=12.\n\n      But can we be faster? \n\n          We want to be at freeway4 at t=5? \n\n          How: \n            t0: U -> (1,1)\n            t1: U -> (2,2)\n            t2: U -> (3,3)\n            t3: S -> (3,4) -> blocked at t4? \n                At the beginning of turn 92+4: we are at 3 -> freeway3 at t4: blocked -> invalid.\n\n          t3: D -> (2,4) [safe]\n          t4: U -> (3,5) [freeway3 at t5: not blocked (only 0 and 4) -> safe]\n          t5: U -> (4,6) [freeway4 at t6: not blocked -> safe]\n          t6: U -> (5,7) [freeway5 at t7: not blocked? freeway5 blocked at t=0,4 -> t7 not blocked -> safe]\n          t7: U -> (6,8) [freeway6: never blocked -> safe]\n          t8: U -> (7,9) [freeway7: safe]\n          t9: U -> (8,10) [freeway8: safe]\n          t10: U -> (9,11) -> we are at 9 at t=11.\n\n          Then we have taken 10 actions? The actions: \n                t0: U\n                t1: U\n                t2: U\n                t3: D\n                t4: U\n                t5: U\n                t6: U\n                t7: U\n                t8: U\n                t9: U\n                t10: (we are at 9 at the beginning of turn 92+10? but we just did 10 actions, so we are at 9 at turn 92+10? and we need to take one more action? \n\n          But note: the state at the beginning of turn 92+10 is the state after 10 actions? \n\n          Actually, the actions are at turns 92,93,...,92+9: 10 actions? Then the state at turn 92+10 is the result of the 10th action.\n\n          How we got to (9,11)? \n\n          We did:\n            at turn 92: U -> to (1,93) [t=1]\n            at turn 93: U -> to (2,94) [t=2]\n            at turn 94: U -> to (3,95) [t=3]\n            at turn 95: D -> to (2,96) [t=4] -> wait, absolute turn at the next state is 92 + (t+1) -> we are indexing t as the step.\n\n          Actually, we are storing state (y, t) where t is the number of turns elapsed: so at the beginning of turn 92+t, we are at y.\n\n          After 10 actions, we have t=10: state at turn 92+10: y=9.\n\n          Then we don't need to take an extra action? But we must output H actions, and H = T+1? and T is the time when we are at 9, which is 10? Then H=11.\n\n          Then we output the 10 actions that got us to 9 at turn 92+10, and then we take an action at turn 92+10: which is S.\n\n          But then we are at 9 at the beginning of turn 92+10? and then we take S at that turn to stay at 9? So the state at turn 92+11 is 9, but we don't care.\n\n          However, the problem requires to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 92+11-1 = 92+10. So we are at 9 at the beginning of turn 92+10, and then we take S at that turn. So that meets the requirement.\n\n          So the sequence: 10 actions (to get to 9 at turn 92+10) and then the 11th action (at turn 92+10) is S.\n\n          But wait: we have 10 actions that got us to 9 at turn 92+10? How many actions? 10 actions, so we started at turn 92 and took actions at 92,93,...,92+9 -> 10 actions. Then the state at turn 92+10 is 9. Then we take an action at turn 92+10: S.\n\n          So total actions: 11.\n\n          The minimal T we can achieve is 10? because we cannot do 9 due to the block at t=4.\n\n      But is there a way to be at 9 at an earlier turn? \n\n          We see that the straight path is blocked at t=4.\n\n          We tried a detour: we went down at t3 (which is turn 92+3) to avoid being at freeway3 at t4? but then we had to go back up.\n\n          Alternatively, we might wait at row0 for one turn: \n\n            t0: S -> (0,1)\n            t1: U -> (1,2) [freeway1: safe at t=2]\n            t2: U -> (2,3) [freeway2: safe at t=3]\n            t3: U -> (3,4) [freeway3: blocked at t=4] -> invalid.\n\n          Or wait two turns at row0:\n\n            t0: S -> (0,1)\n            t1: S -> (0,2)\n            t2: U -> (1,3) [freeway1: safe at t=3]\n            t3: U -> (2,4) [freeway2: safe at t=4]\n            t4: U -> (3,5) [freeway3: safe at t=5? only blocked at 0,4 -> t=5 safe]\n            t5: U -> (4,6) [freeway4: safe at t=6]\n            t6: U -> (5,7) [freeway5: safe at t=7]\n            t7: U -> (6,8) [freeway6: safe]\n            t8: U -> (7,9)\n            t9: U -> (8,10)\n            t10: U -> (9,11) -> then we are at 9 at t=11? same as before.\n\n          Then we have 11 actions? \n\n          Actually, the actions: \n            t0: S\n            t1: S\n            t2: U\n            t3: U\n            t4: U\n            t5: U\n            t6: U\n            t7: U\n            t8: U\n            t9: U\n            t10: U -> this is 11 actions? because from t0 to t10: 11 actions? \n\n          But we are at state (9,11) at the beginning of turn 92+11? and we started at (0,0) at turn 92.\n\n          The number of actions: 11 (turns 92 to 92+10). Then we need to add the 12th action at turn 92+11: S? \n\n          But wait: we are already at 9 at turn 92+11? so we take S at that turn.\n\n          Then H=12? \n\n          Actually, we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 92 + H - 1.\n\n          We are at 9 at turn 92+11 -> so 92+11 = 92 + H - 1 -> H=12.\n\n          So the first path we found (with 10 actions to get to 9 at turn 92+10) leads to H=11? \n\n          How? \n            We are at 9 at turn 92+10 -> then we set H = T+1 = 10+1 = 11.\n            The sequence: the 10 actions (to get to 9 at turn 92+10) and then the 11th action at turn 92+10: S.\n\n          But note: at turn 92+10, we are at the beginning at 9. Then we take action S. \n          So we output:\n\n            Turn 92: U   (from the first action)\n            Turn 93: U\n            Turn 94: U\n            Turn 95: D\n            Turn 96: U\n            Turn 97: U\n            Turn 98: U\n            Turn 99: U\n            Turn 100: U\n            Turn 101: U   [this is the 10th action: at turn 92+9? wait]\n\n          Let me count:\n\n            Action at turn 92: leads to state at 93: y=1 -> so at turn 93: state=1.\n            Action at turn 93: leads to state at 94: y=2.\n            Action at turn 94: leads to state at 95: y=3.\n            Action at turn 95: D -> leads to state at 96: y=2.\n            Action at turn 96: U -> state at 97: y=3.\n            Action at turn 97: U -> state at 98: y=4.\n            Action at turn 98: U -> state at 99: y=5.\n            Action at turn 99: U -> state at 100: y=6.\n            Action at turn 100: U -> state at 101: y=7.\n            Action at turn 101: U -> state at 102: y=8? \n\n          We haven't reached 9 yet.\n\n          I see: we did 10 actions and we are at y=8 at turn 102? \n\n          We need one more U to get to 9 at turn 103.\n\n          So we did 11 actions to get to 9 at turn 103? \n\n          Then T=11? because we are at 9 at turn 92+11? and then we take the 12th action at turn 103: S.\n\n          So the sequence: 11 actions (U,U,U,D,U,U,U,U,U,U,U) to get to 9 at turn 103? and then the 12th action: S at turn 103.\n\n          Then H=12.\n\n          But we thought we would be at 9 at turn 92+10? \n\n          Actually, we start at turn 92: state0=0.\n          After 1 action: turn 93: state1 = 1.\n          After 2 actions: turn 94: state2 = 2.\n          After 3 actions: turn 95: state3 = 3.\n          After 4 actions: turn 96: state4 = 2.\n          After 5 actions: turn 97: state5 = 3.\n          After 6 actions: turn 98: state6 = 4.\n          After 7 actions: turn 99: state7 = 5.\n          After 8 actions: turn 100: state8 = 6.\n          After 9 actions: turn 101: state9 = 7.\n          After 10 actions: turn 102: state10 = 8.\n          After 11 actions: turn 103: state11 = 9.\n\n          So we are at 9 at turn 103, which is 92+11. Then T=11. Then H = T+1 = 12.\n\n          And the actions: the first 11 actions (to get to 9) and then the 12th action at turn 103: S.\n\n          But the problem requires to be at 9 at turn 92+H-1 = 92+12-1 = 92+11 = 103. So that matches.\n\n      Now, is there a path with T<11?\n\n      We need to get to 9 in fewer than 11 turns? \n\n      The minimal without blocking is 9 turns: but blocked at t=4.\n\n      Can we do it in 10 turns? (so we are at 9 at turn 92+10)\n\n      We need to go from 0 to 9 in 10 actions? That means we must use at least 9 U and one extra move that is not U? But we have to avoid the block at freeway4 at t=4.\n\n      How about:\n\n          We do 3 U to get to 3 at t=3 (turns 92,93,94: actions U,U,U) -> state at turn 95 (t=3): y=3.\n          Then we cannot go up at turn 95 to 4 at turn 96 (t=4) because freeway4 is blocked at t=4.\n\n          Instead, we do a down at turn 95: to 2 at turn 96 (t=4) -> safe (freeway2 not blocked at t=4).\n\n          Then we do 7 U's: to go from 2 to 9 in 7 moves? \n\n          How many turns? \n            t=4: at 2\n            t=5: 3\n            t=6: 4\n            t=7: 5\n            t=8: 6\n            t=9: 7\n            t=10: 8\n            t=11: 9\n\n          So we are at 9 at turn 103 (t=11) -> same as before.\n\n      Or, after being at 3 at t=3, we wait for one turn? \n\n          turn 95: S -> then at turn 96 (t=4): still at 3 -> freeway3 at t=4: blocked -> not safe.\n\n      Or, we go up to 4 at a different time? \n\n          We cannot be at 4 at t=4? so we must be at 4 at a different time.\n\n          How about we delay the initial moves? \n\n          t0: S -> (0,1)\n          t1: U -> (1,2)\n          t2: U -> (2,3)\n          t3: U -> (3,4) -> blocked at t=4? no, at the beginning of turn 96 (t=4): we are at 3 -> freeway3 at t=4: blocked -> not safe.\n\n      How about we go up faster in the later part? \n\n          We cannot: we can only move one per turn.\n\n      Another idea: use down in the beginning to avoid? \n\n          But we start at 0, we can't go down.\n\n      Therefore, the minimal T is 11.\n\n      Then we output the 11 actions that got us to 9 at turn 103, and then the 12th action is S at turn 103.\n\n      But note: the 11 actions are:\n\n          a0: U (at turn92)\n          a1: U (93)\n          a2: U (94)\n          a3: D (95)  -> at turn96: state=2\n          a4: U (96) -> state=3\n          a5: U (97) -> state=4  [at turn98: freeway4 at t=6? absolute turn=92+6=98 -> t=6: not blocked -> safe]\n          a6: U (97) -> state=5\n          a7: U (98) -> state=6\n          a8: U (99) -> state=7\n          a9: U (100) -> state=8\n          a10: U (101) -> state=9 at turn102? \n\n          But wait: \n            a0 at turn92: state93=1\n            a1 at turn93: state94=2\n            a2 at turn94: state95=3\n            a3 at turn95: state96=2\n            a4 at turn96: state97=3\n            a5 at turn97: state98=4\n            a6 at turn98: state99=5\n            a7 at turn99: state100=6\n            a8 at turn100: state101=7\n            a9 at turn101: state102=8\n            a10 at turn102: state103=9\n\n          So we need 11 actions: and then we are at 9 at turn103.\n\n          Then the 12th action at turn103: S.\n\n      But the problem: we must be at 9 at turn 92+H-1 = 92+12-1=103. So at the beginning of turn103, we are at 9. Then we take action S at turn103.\n\n      So the sequence is:\n\n          Turn 92: U\n          Turn 93: U\n          Turn 94: U\n          Turn 95: D\n          Turn 96: U\n          Turn 97: U\n          Turn 98: U\n          Turn 99: U\n          Turn 100: U\n          Turn 101: U\n          Turn 102: U   -> this gets us to 9 at turn103.\n          Turn 103: S   -> the last action.\n\n      But wait, the last action is at turn103, which is the 12th action? \n\n      The actions: \n          Turn92: a0\n          Turn93: a1\n          ...\n          Turn103: a11\n\n      So we have 12 actions: a0 to a11.\n\n      And we are at 9 at turn103 (the beginning) -> then we take a11=S at turn103, which is valid.\n\n      This meets the requirement.\n\n      Is there a shorter path? \n\n      We might be able to use a wait somewhere else to save a turn? \n\n      How about at the top: we don't have to go to 9 at the last step? \n\n      But we need to be at 9 at the beginning of a turn.\n\n      Alternatively, we might avoid the down and do a wait at a safe row? \n\n      For example, at t=3, we are at 3. Instead of going down, we go up to 4 at a time when it is not blocked? but freeway4 is only blocked at t=4. So if we can be at 4 at t=5, that is safe.\n\n      How to be at 4 at t=5? \n\n          We must be at 3 at t=4, then go up at t=4 to be at 4 at t=5.\n\n          But at t=4, if we are at 3: freeway3 is blocked at t=4 -> so we cannot be at 3 at t=4.\n\n      How about we be at 5 at t=4? \n\n          To be at 5 at t=4: we need to start at 0, then in 4 moves: 0->1->2->3->4->5? that would be 5 moves? so at turn92+4: we are at 5? then we need 4 moves? \n\n          But we only have 4 moves: \n            t0: U to 1\n            t1: U to 2\n            t2: U to 3\n            t3: U to 4 -> then at turn96 (t=4): we are at 4 -> freeway4: blocked at t=4 -> not safe.\n\n      So we cannot.\n\n      Therefore, the minimal T is 11, and H=12.\n\n      But wait, there is a freeway5 also blocked at t=4? but we are not going to freeway5 at t=4 in the straight path? \n\n      In our detour, we were at freeway4 at t=6? and freeway5 at t=7? which are safe.\n\n      Now, let me double-check the block status for freeway4 at t=6: \n          freeway4: blocked only at t=0 and 4 -> so t=6 is safe.\n\n      freeway5: blocked at t=0 and 4 -> t=7 is safe.\n\n      So our path is valid.\n\n      Therefore, the answer:\n\n          H=12\n\n          Sequence:\n            Turn 92: U\n            Turn 93: U\n            Turn 94: U\n            Turn 95: D\n            Turn 96: U\n            Turn 97: U\n            Turn 98: U\n            Turn 99: U\n            Turn 100: U\n            Turn 101: U\n            Turn 102: U\n            Turn 103: S\n\n      But wait: we only have 12 actions? and the last action is at turn103.\n\n      But we are at 9 at the beginning of turn103, and then we take S at turn103.\n\n      However, the problem says: we must be at (0,9) at turn 92+H-1 = 92+12-1=103. So at the beginning of turn103, we are at 9. That is achieved by the first 11 actions? and the 12th action is taken at turn103.\n\n      But the state at the beginning of turn103 is 9, which is the result of the 11th action (at turn102). Then we take the 12th action (at turn103) which is S, and then the state at turn104 becomes 9.\n\n      The requirement is only for turn103: we are at 9 at the beginning of turn103. So the 12th action is not used to get to 9, but we have to provide it.\n\n      This is per the problem: the sequence has 12 actions.\n\n      So we output:\n\n          Turn 92: U\n          Turn 93: U\n          Turn 94: U\n          Turn 95: D\n          Turn 96: U\n          Turn 97: U\n          Turn 98: U\n          Turn 99: U\n          Turn 100: U\n          Turn 101: U\n          Turn 102: U\n          Turn 103: S\n\n      But note: the last action is at turn103, and we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn103. Then we take S, which is valid.\n\n      Is there a path that uses only 11 actions? Then H=11, and we would be at 9 at turn 92+11-1=92+10=102.\n\n      How? We need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn102.\n\n      We have 10 actions: to get from 0 to 9 in 10 moves? \n\n      But we must avoid:\n          freeway4 at t=4: so we cannot be at freeway4 at turn96 (t=4).\n\n      How about:\n\n          t0: U -> 1 (t1)\n          t1: U -> 2 (t2)\n          t2: U -> 3 (t3)\n          t3: S -> 3 (t4) -> blocked (freeway3 at t4: blocked) -> invalid.\n\n          t3: D -> 2 (t4) -> safe.\n          then we have 7 moves to go from 2 to 9: \n                t4: U->3 (t5)\n                t5: U->4 (t6) [freeway4 at t6: safe? t6=6: not blocked -> safe]\n                t6: U->5 (t7)\n                t7: U->6 (t8)\n                t8: U->7 (t9)\n                t9: U->8 (t10)\n                t10: U->9 (t11)\n\n          Then we are at 9 at turn103 (t11) after 11 actions? \n\n          But we want to be at 9 at turn102 (t10) -> that would be after 10 actions? \n\n          How? we need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn102.\n\n          After 10 actions, we are at 8 at turn102? \n\n          So we cannot be at 9 at turn102.\n\n      Alternatively, if we do not do the down and find another way:\n\n          We might go faster in the beginning and then wait at a safe row? \n\n          But we are constrained by the block at freeway4 at t=4.\n\n      Therefore, the minimal H is 12.\n\n      But note: we have freeway8 that is never blocked, and freeway6,7 also never blocked. \n\n      Another idea: we go down from 0? but we can't.\n\n      Or we go up to 9 but avoid freeway4 at t=4 by being at a row above 4 at t=4? \n\n          To be above 4 at t=4: we need to be at 5 at turn96 (t=4).\n\n          How? \n            t0: U (1)\n            t1: U (2)\n            t2: U (3)\n            t3: U (4) -> then at turn96 (t=4): we are at 4 -> blocked.\n\n          Or: \n            t0: U (1)\n            t1: U (2)\n            t2: U (3)\n            t3: U (4) -> blocked.\n\n          We cannot jump.\n\n      Therefore, we stick to H=12.\n\n      We output the sequence.\n\n      But note: there might be a path with the same H but different actions? But we want minimal H, and we found a path with H=12.\n\n      We'll code the BFS to confirm.\n\n      We do BFS for (y,t) for t from 0 to 12.\n\n      States: y in [0,9], t in [0,12]\n\n      We mark visited to avoid cycles.\n\n      We start: (0,0)\n\n      We want to reach (9,11) [because then we add one action, so H=12]? \n\n      Actually, if we reach (9,11) at the beginning of turn 92+11=103, then we are done. Then we add the 12th action (at turn103) as S.\n\n      But in the BFS, we only need to find a path to (9,11) in 11 actions.\n\n      Steps:\n\n        We'll do:\n\n          queue: (y, t, actions) \n          visited[y][t] = whether visited.\n\n          Start: (0,0,[])\n\n          While queue:\n             pop (y,t,path)\n\n             if y==9 and t==11: we found a path of 11 actions.\n\n             if t>=11: skip? or we can go beyond? but we want minimal t.\n\n             For each action in [U,D,S]:\n                 y_next = y + (1 if U, -1 if D, 0 if S)\n                 if y_next not in [0,9]: skip.\n                 t_next = t+1\n                 if t_next>11: skip? because we want to reach at t=11.\n\n                 if y_next in [1,8]: check if freeway y_next is blocked at turn 92+t_next? \n                    if blocked, skip.\n\n                 If not visited, push (y_next, t_next, path+[action])\n\n        Then if we find a path to (9,11) with 11 actions, then the sequence is that path plus an S at the end? \n\n        But the 11 actions are for turns 92 to 92+10. Then we add the 12th action at turn 92+11: S.\n\n      However, we can also find a path to (9,10) in 10 actions? but we saw that is not possible.\n\n      We run BFS for t up to 11.\n\n      We'll do:\n\n        t=0: (0,0) -> path=[] -> not 9.\n\n        From (0,0): \n            U: (1,1) -> not blocked -> push (1,1,[\"U\"])\n            S: (0,1) -> push (0,1,[\"S\"])\n\n        t=1:\n            (1,1,[\"U\"]):\n                U: (2,2) -> freeway2 at t=2: not blocked -> push (2,2,[\"U\",\"U\"])\n                D: (0,2) -> push (0,2,[\"U\",\"D\"])\n                S: (1,2) -> freeway1 at t=2: not blocked -> push (1,2,[\"U\",\"S\"])\n            (0,1,[\"S\"]):\n                U: (1,2) -> freeway1 at t=2: not blocked -> but we already have (1,2) -> skip if we mark visited.\n                D: skip\n                S: (0,2) -> push (0,2,[\"S\",\"S\"])\n\n        t=2:\n            (2,2,[\"U\",\"U\"]):\n                U: (3,3) -> freeway3 at t=3: not blocked -> push (3,3,[\"U\",\"U\",\"U\"])\n                D: (1,3) -> freeway1 at t=3: not blocked -> push (1,3,[\"U\",\"U\",\"D\"])\n                S: (2,3) -> freeway2 at t=3: not blocked -> push (2,3,[\"U\",\"U\",\"S\"])\n            (0,2,[\"U\",\"D\"]): same as (0,2) from other path -> skip if visited.\n            (1,2,[\"U\",\"S\"]): \n                ... \n            (0,2,[\"S\",\"S\"]):\n                ...\n\n        We continue until we find (9,11).\n\n        We know a path: \n            (0,0) -> (1,1) -> (2,2) -> (3,3) -> (2,4) [D] -> (3,5) [U] -> (4,6) [U] -> (5,7) [U] -> (6,8) [U] -> (7,9) [U] -> (8,10) [U] -> (9,11) [U]\n\n        So the path: \n            t0: U\n            t1: U\n            t2: U\n            t3: D\n            t4: U\n            t5: U\n            t6: U\n            t7: U\n            t8: U\n            t9: U\n            t10: U\n\n        This is 11 actions.\n\n        Then we add the 12th action: S.\n\n        So the full sequence:\n\n            Turn92: U\n            Turn93: U\n            Turn94: U\n            Turn95: D\n            Turn96: U\n            Turn97: U\n            Turn98: U\n            Turn99: U\n            Turn100: U\n            Turn101: U\n            Turn102: U\n            Turn103: S\n\n        This is 12 actions.\n\n      Therefore, we output.\n\n      But note: the action at turn103 is S, which is valid.\n\n      We are done.\n\n      However, we must check that we are not blocked at any freeway during the moves.\n\n      Let's check:\n\n        Turn92: begin at 0 -> safe.

The sequence of actions is determined as follows:\n\n- The player starts at \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 92.\n- The path must avoid freeways blocked at specific turns:\n  - Freeway 1 is blocked at turn 92 (relative turn \\(t = 0\\)).\n  - Freeway 2 is blocked at turn 92 (\\(t = 0\\)).\n  - Freeways 3, 4, and 5 are blocked at turns 92 (\\(t = 0\\)) and 96 (\\(t = 4\\)).\n  - Freeways 6, 7, and 8 are never blocked.\n- The sequence involves moving up to row 3 by turn 95, then moving down to avoid the block at freeway 4 at turn 96 (\\(t = 4\\)), and then moving up consecutively to reach row 9 by turn 103. The last action is staying (S) to remain at row 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns 92 to 103 (12 actions) is:\n\n- Turn 92: Move up (U) to row 1.\n- Turn 93: Move up (U) to row 2.\n- Turn 94: Move up (U) to row 3.\n- Turn 95: Move down (D) to row 2 to avoid the block at freeway 4 at turn 96.\n- Turn 96: Move up (U) to row 3.\n- Turn 97: Move up (U) to row 4 (now safe, as freeway 4 is not blocked at \\(t = 6\\)).\n- Turn 98: Move up (U) to row 5.\n- Turn 99: Move up (U) to row 6.\n- Turn 100: Move up (U) to row 7.\n- Turn 101: Move up (U) to row 8.\n- Turn 102: Move up (U) to row 9.\n- Turn 103: Stay (S) to remain at row 9.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at the beginning of turn 103 (i.e., \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 92 + 12 - 1 = 103\\)) and avoids all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 92: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 93: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 94: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 95: & \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 96: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 97: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 98: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 99: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 100: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 101: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 102: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 103: & \\text{S} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right with constant speed. For left-moving cars, the span decreases, and for right-moving, it increases. Collision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of some car, meaning the car covers position x=0 at that turn.\n\nImportantly, when you move to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and at T+1 you're on y+1. So you only check for collision on the freeway you're currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nThe current turn is t_1 = 96, and player is at (0,0). I need to find actions from t=96 onwards until reaching y=9.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car positions and how they evolve over time.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t_1=96. For each freeway and each car, I have head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nLet me list all cars clearly.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head=48, tail=83, direction=left, speed=36. Since it's left-moving, head should be less than tail? Typically for left-moving, head is left, tail is right, so as it moves left, head decreases.\n\nIn the update: left-moving: span at T is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nHere head=48, tail=83, but if it's left-moving, and head=48, tail=83, that would mean head is at 48, tail at 83, so the car is from 48 to 83, which is increasing x, but direction left? That might be inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps I misread. Let's see the notation.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIt says [h, τ], so h and τ are positions, and for left-moving, both decrease.\n\nBut in this case, for freeway 1: h=48, τ=83. So at t1, span is [48,83]. But 48 to 83, that's from left to right? If it's left-moving, moving left, so decreasing x, but [48,83] with h=48, τ=83, so h < τ, meaning head is at smaller x.\n\nTypically, in grid terms, left is smaller x, right is larger x.\n\nSo for a left-moving car, head is at smaller x, tail at larger x, and as it moves left, both head and tail decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nHere it says [τ, h], so τ and h, with τ probably tail, h head, but for right-moving, head should be larger.\n\nIn freeway 3, for example: cars like (48,37,right,12) — head=48, tail=37? But tail=37, head=48, so if tail is left, head is right, that makes sense for right-moving.\n\nBut in the notation, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" so [tail, head] I think, with tail < head for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" with h < τ, head < tail.\n\nBut in freeway 1: (48,83,left,36), so h=48, τ=83, so head=48, tail=83, so since left-moving, head at 48, tail at 83, so the car occupies x from 48 to 83 at t1.\n\nAs it moves left, both positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 3: (48,37,right,12) — head=48, tail=37? But for right-moving, span is given as [τ, h], so τ=37, h=48, so [37,48] at t1, and since right-moving, it moves to higher x.\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for the span, it depends on direction.\n\nFor left-moving, span is [h, τ] with h and τ positions.\n\nFor right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ and h positions.\n\nIn the car list, for each car, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nThen for left-moving d=left, span is [h, τ] at t1.\n\nFor right-moving d=right, span is [τ, h] at t1.\n\nThen at time T, for left-moving, span [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving, span [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd collision if at turn T, player is on freeway k, and 0 is in the span for some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nPlayer position: at turn T, y_T, and we check if 0 in span of cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, the key point is that when you move, at the turn you move, you are still on the previous y, so for example, if at turn T you are on y, and you move to y+1, then at turn T, you are on y, so you check freeway y for collision at T. Then at T+1, you are on y+1, so you check freeway y+1 at T+1.\n\nSimilarly, if you stay, you are on the same y at T and T+1.\n\nNow, I need to get from y=0 at t=96 to y=9.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0, no cars, so no collision possible. Similarly, y=9 might be safe, but we need to reach (0,9), and since no freeway at y=9, I think it's safe, but the game is to reach (0,9), and freeways are only 1-8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision there.\n\nBut we start at (0,0) at t=96, and need to be at (0,9) at some turn.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns, since we can only change y by at most 1 per turn, the minimum H to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 turns, if we always move up. But we might have to avoid cars, so we might need to wait or go down sometimes, but since we want minimal turns, we should go up as fast as possible, only deviating if necessary to avoid collisions.\n\nBut in this case, with the car positions, we need to see if going straight up is possible without collision.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars for each freeway at t=96.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): one car: head=48, tail=83, direction=left, speed=36. So span at t=96: [48, 83]\n\nSince left-moving, at time T, span [48 - 36(T-96), 83 - 36(T-96)]\n\nCollision on freeway 1 at turn T if player is on y=1 and 0 in span, i.e., 48 - 36(T-96) <= 0 <= 83 - 36(T-96)\n\nSince the car is moving left, and span is decreasing.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 (y=2): same as freeway 1? (48,83,left,36), so identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): three cars:\n\n- (48,37,right,12) : for right-moving, span at t=96 is [τ, h] = [37,48] since τ=37, h=48\n\n- (12,1,right,12) : span [τ,h] = [1,12]\n\n- (-24,-35,right,12) : span [τ,h] = [-35,-24]? τ=-35, h=-24, so span [-35,-24]\n\nAll right-moving, so at time T, each car's span:\n\nFirst car: [37 + 12(T-96), 48 + 12(T-96)]\n\nSecond car: [1 + 12(T-96), 12 + 12(T-96)]\n\nThird car: [-35 + 12(T-96), -24 + 12(T-96)]\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): same as freeway 3? Cars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) — same as y=3.\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): same again: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): one car: (48,37,right,6) — so head=48, tail=37, direction right, speed 6.\n\nSpan at t=96: [τ,h] = [37,48]\n\nAt T: [37 + 6(T-96), 48 + 6(T-96)]\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): similar, (48,37,right,6), so [37,48] at t=96, at T: [37 + 6(T-96), 48 + 6(T-96)]\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): two cars: (48,37,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6) span [37,48] at t=96\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6) head=0, tail=-11, direction right, so span [τ,h] = [-11,0] at t=96? τ=-11, h=0, so [-11,0]\n\nAt T: for first car [37 + 6(T-96), 48 + 6(T-96)]\n\nFor second car [-11 + 6(T-96), 0 + 6(T-96)] = [-11 +6(T-96), 6(T-96)]\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at t=96.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need to go through y=1 to 8 at some turns.\n\nSince we want minimal turns, we should move up as much as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on a freeway when a car covers x=0.\n\nFor each freeway, we need to find times when it is safe to be on that freeway, i.e., when no car on that row has 0 in its span.\n\nSince multiple cars, we need for that freeway at turn T, for all cars, 0 not in their span at T.\n\nLet t = T - 96, so relative time from now.\n\nSet t=0 at current turn 96.\n\nSo at turn T from now, time t = T - 96.\n\nPlayer position: start at y=0 at t=0.\n\nAfter each action, y changes.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t= k, we are at y_k.\n\nThe turn when we are on a freeway y, we need that at that turn, for freeway y, 0 not in any car's span.\n\nNow, for each freeway, find the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when there is a car with 0 in span.\n\nThen we need to schedule when to be on each freeway at a safe time.\n\nSince we move step by step, we need to plan the sequence.\n\nFirst, let's find for each y from 1 to 8, the set of t where it is unsafe to be on that row.\n\nt is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nt >=0.\n\nFreeway y=1: one car, left-moving, span at t=0: [48,83]\n\nAt time t, span [48 - 36t, 83 - 36t]\n\n0 in span if 48 - 36t <= 0 <= 83 - 36t\n\nSince 48-36t <= 0 and 0 <= 83-36t\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36t <= 0 => 36t >= 48 => t >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so t>=2 since t integer\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 83-36t => 36t <=83 => t <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so t<=2\n\nt<=2 and t>=2, so t=2\n\nt>=2 and t<=2, so only t=2\n\nt=2: 48-36*2=48-72=-24 <=0, and 0<=83-72=11, yes 0<=11 true.\n\nt=1: 48-36=12>0, so 0 not <=12? 0 <=12 true, but 48-36t=12>0, so 12 <=0 false? The inequality is 48-36t <=0 and 0<=83-36t\n\nAt t=1: 48-36=12 >0, so 12 <=0 false, so not satisfied.\n\nAt t=2: 48-72=-24<=0 true, 0<=83-72=11 true.\n\nAt t=3: 48-108=-60<=0 true, but 0<=83-108=-25? 0<= -25 false.\n\nSo only unsafe at t=2 for y=1.\n\nt=2 means turn T=96+2=98.\n\nBut in terms of t from now.\n\nSimilarly, freeway y=2: same as y=1, so also unsafe only at t=2.\n\nNow freeway y=3: three cars, all right-moving.\n\nFirst car: at t=0, span [37,48], at time t, [37 +12t, 48+12t]\n\n0 in span if 37+12t <=0 <=48+12t\n\n37+12t <=0 => 12t <= -37, t <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, but t>=0, so impossible. So never true for t>=0.\n\nSecond car: at t=0, [1,12], at t, [1+12t, 12+12t]\n\n0 in span if 1+12t <=0 <=12+12t\n\n1+12t <=0 => 12t <= -1, t <= -1/12, impossible for t>=0.\n\nThird car: at t=0, [-35,-24], at t, [-35+12t, -24+12t]\n\n0 in span if -35+12t <=0 <= -24+12t\n\nFirst: -35+12t <=0 => 12t <=35 => t <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so t<=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24+12t => 24 <=12t => t >= 24/12 =2\n\nSo t>=2 and t<=2, so t=2\n\nAt t=2: -35+24= -11 <=0 true, 0 <= -24+24=0 true, 0<=0.\n\nSo for third car, unsafe at t=2.\n\nNow, for y=3, collision if any car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst car never, second car never, third car at t=2.\n\nSo y=3 unsafe only at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway y=4: same as y=3, so unsafe only at t=2.\n\nFreeway y=5: same as y=3, unsafe only at t=2.\n\nNow freeway y=6: one car, right-moving, (48,37,right,6) so head=48, tail=37, span at t=0: [37,48]\n\nAt t: [37+6t, 48+6t]\n\n0 in span: 37+6t <=0 <=48+6t\n\n37+6t <=0 => 6t <= -37, impossible for t>=0.\n\nSo never unsafe. y=6 is always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway y=7: same as y=6, one car (48,37,right,6), same thing, 37+6t <=0 impossible, so always safe.\n\nNow freeway y=8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6) span at t=0: [37,48], at t: [37+6t, 48+6t], same as above, never has 0 in span for t>=0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6) head=0, tail=-11, direction right, so span at t=0: [τ,h] = [-11,0] since τ=-11, h=0.\n\nAt time t: [ -11 +6t, 0 +6t ] = [-11+6t, 6t]\n\n0 in span if -11+6t <= 0 <= 6t\n\nFirst: -11+6t <=0 => 6t <=11 => t <= 11/6 ≈1.833, so t<=1\n\nSecond: 0 <= 6t, true for t>=0, but since t integer, t>=1? 0 <=6t always for t>=0, but at t=0, 0<=0 true.\n\n0 <= 6t: for t=0, 0<=0 true; t=1, 0<=6 true, etc.\n\nBut -11+6t <=0 and 0<=6t\n\n0<=6t is always true for t>=0.\n\n-11+6t <=0 => 6t <=11 => t <= 11/6 ≈1.833, so t=0,1\n\nAt t=0: -11+0 = -11 <=0 true, 0<=0 true, so 0 in span.\n\nAt t=1: -11+6= -5 <=0 true, 0<=6 true.\n\nAt t=2: -11+12=1 <=0? 1 <=0 false, so not.\n\nSo for second car, unsafe at t=0 and t=1.\n\nNow for y=8, collision if either car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst car: never\n\nSecond car: at t=0 and t=1\n\nSo y=8 unsafe at t=0 and t=1.\n\nt=0 and t=1.\n\nt=0 is current time, turn 96.\n\nBut player is not on y=8 now, so for future, when we are on y=8, we need to avoid t=0 and t=1 relative.\n\nt relative to now.\n\nSummary of unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: unsafe at t=2\n\n- y=2: unsafe at t=2\n\n- y=3: unsafe at t=2\n\n- y=4: unsafe at t=2\n\n- y=5: unsafe at t=2\n\n- y=6: always safe\n\n- y=7: always safe\n\n- y=8: unsafe at t=0 and t=1\n\nt=0 is now, turn 96, but since player is at y=0, not on y=8, so for being on y=8, we care about t>=1 or something.\n\nNow, player starts at y=0 at t=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: we need to go to y=1, then y=2, ..., up to y=9.\n\nEach step, we can move up, down, or stay.\n\nBut to minimize time, we should move up when possible.\n\nNow, the unsafe times: for y=1 to 5, all unsafe only at t=2, meaning at relative time t=2, if we are on any of y=1 to 5 at that time, we collide.\n\ny=6 and y=7 always safe.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=0 and t=1, but t=0 is past, so for future, when we are on y=8, we need to be at t>=2, since unsafe at t=0 and t=1.\n\nt=0 and t=1 relative to now.\n\nNow, since we start at t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to be on each y from 1 to 8 at some turn, and at that turn, it must be safe for that y.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so always safe once we reach it.\n\nNow, the critical point is t=2, which is unsafe for y=1 to 5.\n\ny=6 and y=7 are always safe, so we can be on them at any time.\n\ny=8 is unsafe at t=0 and t=1, safe for t>=2.\n\nTo minimize time, we should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on y=1 to 5 at t=2.\n\nt=2 is two turns from now.\n\nCurrent turn t=0: y=0\n\nAfter one action, at t=1, we can be at y=0 or y=1.\n\nThen at t=2, we can be at y=0,1,2 depending on actions.\n\nIf we move up at t=0, we go to y=1 at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, if we are on y=1, is it safe? For y=1, unsafe only at t=2, so at t=1, y=1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=1, y=1 is safe, since unsafe only at t=2.\n\nBut at t=2, if we are on y=1, it is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for y=2 to 5.\n\nNow, y=6 and y=7 always safe, y=8 safe only for t>=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H: since we start at y=0, to y=9, at least 9 moves up, but we can stay or go down, but that increases time, so we should avoid that if possible.\n\nWith the constraints, we might need to delay or something.\n\nSince y=1 to 5 are only unsafe at t=2, we can be on them at other times.\n\nFor example, we can be on y=1 at t=1 or t=3, etc., but not at t=2.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut since we are moving sequentially, we need to coordinate.\n\nNow, let's think about the timing.\n\nSuppose we move up at every turn.\n\nThen:\n\nt=0: start y=0, action? At t=0, we take action to move to next y.\n\nSequence of actions.\n\nAt turn T=96 (t=0), player is at (0,0). We choose action a_{96}.\n\nIf a_{96} = U, then y_{97} = y_{96} +1 =1\n\nIf S, y_{97}=0\n\nIf D, y_{97}= -1? But y must be in [0,9], so y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so from y=0, D is invalid? y cannot be negative.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, U invalid.\n\nIn the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y_t, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0, delta y cannot be -1, so a_t cannot be D. Similarly at y=9, cannot U.\n\nAt y=0, possible actions: U or S.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, D or S.\n\nNow, start at y=0, t=0 (T=96).\n\nIf we always go up:\n\nAction at t=0 (T=96): U, then at t=1 (T=97), y=1\n\nThen at t=1 (T=97), action U, then at t=2 (T=98), y=2\n\nAt t=2 (T=98), we are on y=2.\n\nBut y=2 is unsafe at t=2, so collision.\n\nIf we go up at t=0 to y=1 at t=1, then at t=1, if we stay or down, but down not possible, so only S or U.\n\nIf at t=1, we stay: action S at T=97, then y remains 1 at t=2 (T=98), but y=1 at t=2 is unsafe.\n\nIf we go up to y=2 at t=2, also unsafe.\n\nSo if we are on y=1 or y=2 at t=2, we collide.\n\nTo avoid, we need not to be on y=1 to 5 at t=2.\n\nSince we start at y=0, at t=0.\n\nAt t=1, we can be at y=0 or y=1.\n\nIf at t=1 we are at y=0, then at t=2, we can be at y=0 (if S), or y=1 (if U from y=0).\n\ny=0 and y=1 at t=2.\n\ny=0 is safe, no cars.\n\ny=1 at t=2 is unsafe.\n\nSo at t=2, if we are on y=1, unsafe; if on y=0, safe.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\ny=6 and y=7 are always safe, so we can pass through them quickly.\n\ny=8 needs to be at t>=2.\n\nt=2 is early, only two turns from now.\n\nSince we are at y=0 at t=0, we can stay at y=0 for a few turns to avoid being on y=1-5 at t=2.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=0 until after t=2.\n\nt=2 is T=98.\n\nAt t=0 (T=96): we are at y=0, take action.\n\nSuppose we take S at T=96, then at t=1 (T=97), still y=0.\n\nThen at t=1 (T=97), take action.\n\nIf we take U at T=97, then at t=2 (T=98), y=1.\n\nBut y=1 at t=2 is unsafe.\n\nIf we take S again at T=97, then at t=2 (T=98), y=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=2 (T=98), we can take action.\n\nNow t=2 is over, so for y=1 to 5, it is safe after t=2.\n\nAt t=3, etc.\n\nAfter t=2, y=1 to 5 are safe.\n\ny=1 unsafe only at t=2, so for t>2 or t<2, safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=2 to 5.\n\ny=6 and y=7 always safe.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=0 and t=1, so for t>=2, safe.\n\nNow, since we are at y=0 at t=2 (if we stayed).\n\nThen we can start moving up.\n\nBut we lost some time.\n\nMinimal H might be more than 9.\n\nFirst, let's see the earliest we can reach each y.\n\nSince y=1 to 5 are safe except at t=2, we can be on them at t=1 or t=3, etc.\n\nBut we start from y=0.\n\nOption: go to y=1 at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, y=1 is safe, since unsafe only at t=2.\n\nThen at t=1, we are on y=1, safe.\n\nThen we need to not be on y=1 to 5 at t=2.\n\nSo at t=2, we should be on y<1 or y>5.\n\ny<1: y=0\n\ny>5: y=6,7,8 but we are at y=1, cannot jump to y=6 directly.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=1, we can only go to y=0,1,2 at t=2.\n\ny=0,1,2.\n\nBut y=1 and y=2 are unsafe at t=2.\n\ny=0 is safe, but we have to go down? From y=1, if we go down, y=0 at t=2.\n\nBut y=0 is not a freeway, so no collision, but we are going down, which might not be efficient.\n\nThen at t=2, we are at y=0, safe.\n\nThen after that, we can go up.\n\nBut we wasted a move down.\n\nAnother option: at t=1, we are at y=1, instead of moving to y=2 at t=2 which is unsafe, we stay at y=1 at t=2, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nOr go down to y=0 at t=2.\n\nThen we avoid collision but lose time.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=6 or y=7 quickly, but we can only move one step at a time.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 and y=7 are always safe, and y=8 is safe after t=1, we can go directly to higher y, but we have to go through 1 to 5 first.\n\nUnless we wait.\n\nLet's list possible paths with minimal time.\n\nThe critical point is t=2.\n\nTo avoid being on y=1 to 5 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, we must be on y=0 or y=6,7,8 or 9, but we are at y=0 at t=0, so at t=2, we can be at y=0,1,2.\n\nCannot be at y=6,7,8 at t=2 from start.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=0:\n\n- If U at t=0, to y=1 at t=1\n\n- If S at t=0, to y=0 at t=1\n\nAt t=1:\n\nIf at y=1:\n\n- U: to y=2 at t=2\n\n- S: to y=1 at t=2\n\n- D: to y=0 at t=2\n\nIf at y=0:\n\n- U: to y=1 at t=2\n\n- S: to y=0 at t=2\n\n- D: invalid\n\nSo at t=2, possible y: 0,1,2\n\ny=0 safe, y=1 unsafe, y=2 unsafe.\n\nSo only safe at t=2 is y=0.\n\nTherefore, to avoid collision, at t=2 we must be at y=0.\n\nThat means we must not move up too early.\n\nSpecifically, we must be at y=0 at t=2.\n\nNow, from start, we can achieve that by:\n\nOption 1: at t=0 (T=96), action S, so at t=1 (T=97), y=0\n\nThen at t=1 (T=97), action S, so at t=2 (T=98), y=0\n\nOption 2: at t=0, U, to y=1 at t=1\n\nThen at t=1, D, to y=0 at t=2\n\nBut D from y=1 to y=0 is possible.\n\nIn both cases, we reach y=0 at t=2.\n\nBut in option 2, we moved up and down, same as staying twice? Time-wise same.\n\nAt t=2, we are at y=0, safe.\n\nNow, t=2 is over, so for t>=3, all freeways are safe except y=8 which is safe for t>=2, and y=1-5 safe for t!=2.\n\nSince t=2 passed, for t>2, all y=1 to 8 are safe? y=1 to 5 safe for t>2, y=6,7 always safe, y=8 safe for t>=2.\n\nt>=2 includes t=2, but at t=2 we are at y=0, not on freeway.\n\nFor t>2, all freeways are safe.\n\nNow, from t=2, we are at y=0.\n\nWe can start moving up.\n\nTo minimize time, move up every turn.\n\nSo:\n\nAt t=2 (T=98), action U, go to y=1 at t=3 (T=99)\n\nAt t=3 (T=99), action U, to y=2 at t=4 (T=100)\n\n...\n\nContinue up to y=9.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nStart: t=0, T=96, y=0\n\nTo be at y=0 at t=2, we need to take actions accordingly.\n\nFor example, take action S at T=96: so at T=97, y=0 (t=1)\n\nThen at T=97, take action S: at T=98, y=0 (t=2)\n\nThen at T=98, take action U: at T=99, y=1\n\nAt T=99, action U: at T=100, y=2\n\nAt T=100, action U: at T=101, y=3\n\nAt T=101, action U: at T=102, y=4\n\nAt T=102, action U: at T=103, y=5\n\nAt T=103, action U: at T=104, y=6\n\nAt T=104, action U: at T=105, y=7\n\nAt T=105, action U: at T=106, y=8\n\nAt T=106, action U: at T=107, y=9\n\nNow, we reach y=9 at T=107.\n\nTotal turns: from T=96 to T=107, that's 11 turns? Let's see.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=11? Define H as the number of actions, or the number of turns including start?\n\nThe sequence: actions at t=0 to t=H-1, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, we are at y=9? Let's see the indexing.\n\nThe player position: at turn t, before action, position is given, then we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nIn the problem: \"current turn is t_1\", player position (0, y_{t_1})\n\nThen we choose actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, we have y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1, so H actions, and we reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nFor example, if no action, H=0, at turn t_1, y=9, but not.\n\nWe start at y=0, need to reach y=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, a_{t} for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nIn my earlier sequence:\n\nAt turn T=96: position y=0, we choose a_{96}\n\nAfter a_{96}, at T=97, y changes.\n\nIn my plan: at T=96: action S, so y_{97} = y_{96} +0 =0\n\nAt T=97: action S, y_{98} =0\n\nAt T=98: action U, y_{99} =1\n\n...\n\nAt T=106: action U, y_{107} =8? Let's list:\n\nTurn | action | y after action, i.e., at next turn\n\nBetter to list the turn when action is taken and the resulting y at next turn.\n\nTurn t: action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta\n\nAt turn t=96: y=0, choose a_96\n\nIf a_96 = S, then y_{97} =0\n\nAt turn t=97: y=0, choose a_97\n\nIf a_97 = S, then y_{98} =0\n\nAt turn t=98: y=0, choose a_98 = U, then y_{99} =1\n\nAt turn t=99: y=1, choose a_99 = U, then y_{100} =2\n\nAt turn t=100: y=2, choose a_100 = U, then y_{101} =3\n\nAt turn t=101: y=3, choose a_{101} = U, then y_{102} =4\n\nAt turn t=102: y=4, choose a_{102} = U, then y_{103} =5\n\nAt turn t=103: y=5, choose a_{103} = U, then y_{104} =6\n\nAt turn t=104: y=6, choose a_{104} = U, then y_{105} =7\n\nAt turn t=105: y=7, choose a_{105} = U, then y_{106} =8\n\nAt turn t=106: y=8, choose a_{106} = U, then y_{107} =9\n\nSo at turn T=107, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=96 to t=106, that's 11 actions? Turns: 96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106: 11 turns for actions.\n\nH is the number of turns in the sequence, from t=0 to H-1, so H=11 actions.\n\nBut we reached at turn t_1 + H = 96 + 11 = 107, y=9.\n\nIs this minimal?\n\nEarlier I thought about moving up and down.\n\nFor example, at t=0 (T=96), action U, to y=1 at T=97 (t=1)\n\nThen at t=1 (T=97), action D, to y=0 at T=98 (t=2)\n\nThen at t=2 (T=98), y=0, then action U at T=98, to y=1 at T=99, etc.\n\nSame as before: from T=98 on, same as above.\n\nAt T=96: U, y97=1\n\nT=97: D, y98=0\n\nT=98: U, y99=1\n\nThen T=99: U, y100=2\n\n...\n\nUp to y9.\n\nFrom y=1 at T=99, to y=2 at T=100, ..., y=8 at T=106, y=9 at T=107.\n\nSame as before, 11 actions to reach at T=107.\n\nIn the first way, with two S, we had actions from T=96 to 106, 11 actions.\n\nHere also T=96 to 106, 11 actions.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at same time.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we go to y=1 at t=1 (T=97)\n\nThen at t=2, we need to not be on y=1-5, but we can only be on y=0,1,2, all of which except y=0 are unsafe, and y=0 requires going down.\n\nBut going down wastes time.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=6 or higher at t=2, but impossible from start.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 and y=7 are always safe, we can go to them quickly after t=2.\n\nBut we need to go through lower y first.\n\nPerhaps we can stay at y=0 only one turn, but at t=2 we must be at y=0.\n\nIf we stay only one turn, for example:\n\nAt T=96: S, to y=0 at T=97 (t=1)\n\nThen at T=97: U, to y=1 at T=98 (t=2)\n\nBut at t=2, y=1, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt T=96: U, to y=1 at T=97 (t=1)\n\nThen at T=97: S, to y=1 at T=98 (t=2), unsafe.\n\nOr D to y=0 at T=98, safe but then we are back.\n\nNo way to be at y=0 at t=2 except by being at y=0 at t=1 and staying, or at y=1 at t=1 and going down.\n\nEither way, we have two turns where we don't gain y, so we need two extra turns.\n\nMinimal H: without obstacles, min H=9 actions to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nWith obstacles, we need at least 9, but here we use 11, so 2 extra.\n\nBut is there a way with 10 or 9?\n\nSuppose we can be on y=1 at t=1, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=2, we need to be on a safe y, but only y=0 is safe, so we go down to y=0 at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, we are at y=0.\n\nThen from there, we go up.\n\nBut we lost the progress to y=1.\n\nThen we have to go up from y=0 at t=2 to y=9, which takes at least 9 actions, so from t=2 to t=11, y=9 at t=11? Let's see.\n\nAt t=2, y=0\n\nAction at t=2: U, to y=1 at t=3\n\nU at t=3, to y=2 at t=4\n\n...\n\nU at t=10, to y=9 at t=11? From y=0 at t=2 to y=9 at t=11: actions at t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10: 9 actions, to y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut we started from t=0.\n\nAt t=0: action, to y? at t=1\n\nIn this case: at t=0: U, to y=1 at t=1\n\nt=1: D, to y=0 at t=2\n\nt=2: U, to y=1 at t=3\n\nt=3: U, to y=2 at t=4\n\n...\n\nt=10: U, to y=9 at t=11\n\nActions from t=0 to t=10: 11 actions, to y=9 at t=11.\n\nSame as before.\n\nWithout the down, but we can't.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier by moving faster through safe zones.\n\nBut y=1-5 must be traversed after t=2.\n\nSince y=6 and y=7 are always safe, but we have to go through 1-5 first.\n\nAfter t=2, we can go up quickly.\n\nIn the sequence, from y=0 at t=2, we go up each turn to y=1 at t=3, y=2 at t=4, ..., y=8 at t=10, y=9 at t=11.\n\nt=10 to y=9? Let's index.\n\nTime t: after actions, y at time t.\n\nSet t such that at time t, y_t is position.\n\nAt t=0, y=0\n\nAfter action at t, y_{t+1} set.\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, when we are on y_T, we check collision at that turn.\n\nIn terms of the freeway at that turn.\n\nIn the sequence above, with two stays or one up and one down, we reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nNow, the actions: we need to output the sequence from t_1=96.\n\nIn the first method: all actions S at first, then U.\n\nBut we need to check when we are on each freeway.\n\nIn the sequence: with two S at beginning.\n\nAt T=96: action S\n\nT=97: action S\n\nT=98: action U → to y=1 at T=99\n\nAt T=99, we are on y=1, turn T=99, t=3 relative? t = T - 96\n\nT=99, t=3\n\ny=1 at t=3, which is after t=2, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=100: on y=2 at t=4, safe.\n\n...\n\nT=106: on y=8 at t=10, T=106, t=10\n\nNow, y=8 at t=10, is it safe?\n\ny=8 unsafe only at t=0 and t=1.\n\nt=10 >=2, so safe.\n\nThen T=107: y=9, reached.\n\nIn the up-down method: T=96: U → y=1 at T=97\n\nAt T=97, we are on y=1, turn T=97, t=1\n\ny=1 at t=1, which is not t=2, so safe.\n\nThen action at T=97: D → y=0 at T=98\n\nAt T=98, on y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nThen T=98: U → y=1 at T=99\n\nAt T=99, on y=1, t=3, safe.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nNow, in both cases, we have 11 actions.\n\nBut can we save one turn?\n\nSuppose we go to y=1 at t=1 (T=97), safe.\n\nThen at t=1, instead of going down, we go up to y=2 at t=2, but y=2 at t=2 unsafe, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nStay at y=1 at t=2, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=6 at some point, but we need to go through 1-5.\n\nAnother idea: since y=8 is safe only after t=2, and we can reach it later.\n\nBut in the path, we have to spend at least one turn on each y from 1 to 8, except we can skip if we stay, but staying doesn't skip, it stays on same y.\n\nTo increase y, we must move up.\n\nEach move up increases y by one, so to go from y=0 to y=9, we need exactly 9 move-up actions, and possibly some stay or down actions, but down would require more moves up later, so it increases total actions.\n\nTo minimize actions, we should minimize non-up actions, ideally zero, but here we need to avoid, so we have some non-up actions.\n\nIn this case, we have two non-up actions: either two stays or one stay and one down, etc.\n\nIn the sequence, we have two non-up actions at the beginning or one up and one down.\n\nThen 9 up actions.\n\nTotal 11 actions.\n\nIs there a way with only one non-up action?\n\nFor example, if we could be on y=1 at t=1, then at t=2, instead of being on y=1 or 2, we could be on a higher y, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps at t=1, we are at y=1, and we move up to y=2 at t=2, but unsafe, unless we can avoid collision, but we can't.\n\nAnother thought: the collision depends on the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nBut in this case, at t=2, y=1 to 5 are all unsafe, so no matter which one we are on, if y=1-5 at t=2, collision.\n\nSo we must not be on any of them at t=2.\n\nThe only safe place at t=2 is y=0 or y=6-9.\n\ny=6-9 not reachable at t=2.\n\nSo only y=0.\n\nThus, we must be at y=0 at t=2.\n\nTherefore, minimal way is to be at y=0 at t=0 and t=1 and t=2, or at y=1 at t=1 and y=0 at t=2.\n\nIn both cases, we have two turns at y=0 before moving up.\n\nThen 9 up actions.\n\nTotal 11 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can start moving up later but faster, but no.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we need to output the actions.\n\nNow, for y=8, we need to be at t>=2, which in our case, when we are on y=8, t=10, which is fine.\n\nIn the sequence with two stays:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 96: S\n\nTurn 97: S\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U  // to y=2 at T=100? Let's list properly.\n\nTurn | action | y after action (at next turn)\n\nTurn 96: a= S → y_{97} = 0\n\nTurn 97: a= S → y_{98} = 0\n\nTurn 98: a= U → y_{99} = 1\n\nTurn 99: a= U → y_{100} = 2\n\nTurn 100: a= U → y_{101} = 3\n\nTurn 101: a= U → y_{102} = 4\n\nTurn 102: a= U → y_{103} = 5\n\nTurn 103: a= U → y_{104} = 6\n\nTurn 104: a= U → y_{105} = 7\n\nTurn 105: a= U → y_{106} = 8\n\nTurn 106: a= U → y_{107} = 9\n\nReached at T=107.\n\nWith up and down:\n\nTurn 96: U → y_{97} = 1\n\nTurn 97: D → y_{98} = 0  // from y=1, D to y=0\n\nTurn 98: U → y_{99} = 1\n\nTurn 99: U → y_{100} = 2\n\n...\n\nSame as above, from turn 98 onwards same.\n\nIn the up-down, at turn 97 we go down, which might be less efficient in terms of progress, but same number of actions.\n\nNow, in both cases, we have to output the actions.\n\nBut in the first method, we have two S at start, which might be fine.\n\nIn the up-down, we have an extra down, which might be unnecessary.\n\nBut both work.\n\nNow, but we need to make sure that when we are on y=8, it is safe.\n\nIn the sequence, when we are on y=8, at turn T=106, t= T-96=10, which is >=2, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways after t=2 are safe.\n\nIn the car list, for y=8, there is a car that was at (0,-11,right,6) at t=0, which at t=0 and t=1 covers x=0, but at t=10, span [-11+60, 60] = [49,60], not covering 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nNow, but in the answer, we need the sequence.\n\nBut in the up-down method, at turn 97, we are on y=1 at t=1, which is safe, and we go down to y=0.\n\nBut going down might not be necessary, but it works.\n\nTo avoid down, the two S method is fine.\n\nNow, the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence with two S, actions: Turn 96: S, Turn 97: S, Turn 98: U, ..., up to Turn 106: U.\n\nNumber of actions: from 96 to 106, that's 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut let's confirm the minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can move up immediately after t=2.\n\nAnother point: at t=3, we go to y=1, etc., all safe.\n\nBut is there a freeway that has other unsafe times?\n\nFor example, y=3, we had only unsafe at t=2, but let's double-check.\n\nFreeway y=3: cars, we had third car unsafe at t=2, but for t=3, is it safe?\n\nAt t=3, relative.\n\nFor y=3, third car: span at t: [-35+12t, -24+12t]\n\nAt t=3: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], so 0 not in, since min 1>0.\n\nSimilarly, other cars, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at t=10: second car span [-11+60, 60]= [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nFirst car [37+60,48+60]=[97,108], not 0.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, we have to go through each y, but we don't need to stay, we can move up continuously except at start.\n\nNow, in the answer format, we need to output the actions.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,0) at turn 96, and we need actions from turn 96 onwards.\n\nIn the sequence with two S:\n\nTurn 96: S\n\nTurn 97: S\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nTurn 100: U\n\nTurn 101: U\n\nTurn 102: U\n\nTurn 103: U\n\nTurn 104: U\n\nTurn 105: U\n\nTurn 106: U\n\nThen at turn 107, y=9.\n\nThe actions are for turns 96 to 106.\n\nIn the box, we need to list each turn and action.\n\nBut H=11, from t=0 to 10 relative.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster by not going down.\n\nBut I think not.\n\nSince y=6 and y=7 are always safe, we could go to them earlier, but we have to go through 1-5 first, which we can only do after t=2.\n\nFor example, after t=2, we can go quickly through 1-5 to 6-7.\n\nBut we still need one turn per y increase.\n\nMinimal time from y=0 to y=9 is 9 up actions, but we need to delay the start.\n\nIn this case, with 2 delays, total 11.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=1 at t=1, safe, then at t=2, we go down to y=0 to avoid, but then we have to go back up.\n\nSame time.\n\nI think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see the car on y=8.\n\ny=8 has a car that was at (0,-11,right,6), which at t=0 and t=1 covers 0, but at t=2 and later not.\n\nIn our sequence, when we reach y=8 at t=10, safe.\n\nBut we could reach y=8 earlier? But we start from below.\n\nFor example, if we could be at y=8 at t=2, but we can't, from y=0.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, I think the sequence is fine.\n\nNow, for the output, we can use the two S method.\n\nIn the action sequence, we need to specify for each turn.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be like:\n\nTurn 96: a_{96}\n\nTurn 97: a_{97}\n\netc.\n\nWith actions.\n\nSince both methods work, I'll use the no-down method.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 96: S\n\nTurn 97: S\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nTurn 100: U\n\nTurn 101: U\n\nTurn 102: U\n\nTurn 103: U\n\nTurn 104: U\n\nTurn 105: U\n\nTurn 106: U\n\nThat's 11 actions.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9, and at turn 106 action U, to y=9 at turn 107.\n\nIs there a shorter sequence?\n\nSuppose we only stay once.\n\nFor example, at turn 96: S, to y=0 at 97\n\nThen turn 97: U, to y=1 at 98\n\nBut at turn 98, t=2, y=1, unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nTurn 96: U, to y=1 at 97\n\nTurn 97: S, to y=1 at 98, unsafe.\n\nOr turn 97: D, to y=0 at 98, safe, but then we have to go up from y=0 at t=2.\n\nSame as before.\n\nNo way to save a turn.\n\nThus, minimal H=11.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have 11 actions.\n\nBut let's list the turns: 96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106.\n\nThat's 11 turns.\n\nAnd actions as above.\n\nIn the output, it should be in the box.\n\nBut we need to write it.\n\nPerhaps we can start moving up from turn 98, but with two S or equivalent.\n\nAnother thing: at y=0, we can only S or U, not D.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, only D or S.\n\nBut not issue.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 96: S\n\nTurn 97: S\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nTurn 100: U\n\nTurn 101: U\n\nTurn 102: U\n\nTurn 103: U\n\nTurn 104: U\n\nTurn 105: U\n\nTurn 106: U\n\nIn the answer, it should be for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=11.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on y=8 at other times.\n\nFor example, is y=8 unsafe only at t=0 and t=1?\n\nWe have t=0 and t=1, but for t=2, span [-11+12, 12]= [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nt=3: [-11+18,18]= [7,18], etc., all safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways no issue.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 96\\) with the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), the sequence of actions must avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at all turns. The analysis shows that freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\) are unsafe only at relative time \\(t = 2\\) (i.e., turn \\(98\\)), and freeway \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe at \\(t = 0\\) (turn \\(96\\)) and \\(t = 1\\) (turn \\(97\\)). Freeways \\(y = 6\\) and \\(y = 7\\) are always safe. To avoid collision, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at \\(t = 2\\) (turn \\(98\\)), as this is the only safe position at that time. This requires two non-up actions initially (either two \"S\" actions or one \"U\" followed by one \"D\"), but using \"S\" actions avoids unnecessary movement. After \\(t = 2\\), all freeways are safe, and the player can move up (\"U\") consecutively to reach \\(y = 9\\) in minimal time.\n\nThe minimal sequence involves:\n- Two \"S\" actions at turns \\(96\\) and \\(97\\) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) until after the unsafe \\(t = 2\\).\n- Nine consecutive \"U\" actions from turn \\(98\\) to turn \\(106\\) to move from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis results in \\(H = 11\\) actions, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(107\\).\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 96: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 97: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 98: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 99: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 100: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 101: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 102: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 103: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 104: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 105: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 106: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 98, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe car update rules: \n- For a left-moving car (direction 'left'): at time T, the car span is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n  Note: In the given state, for freeway 1 and 2, the car is given as (48,83,left,36). However, note that for a left-moving car, the head is at a higher x? But the update rule subtracts s*(T-t1). Actually, the representation (head, tail) might be such that for left-moving, the head is the front which is moving left, so initially at t1, the car spans from h to τ? But in the example, for freeway 1: (48,83,left,36) — this seems odd because 48<83, so if the car is moving left, then the head (front) should be at a larger x? Actually, the problem states: for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. But if h=48 and τ=83, then [48,83] and moving left would mean the entire car moves left (decreasing x). However, 48<83, so the car is from 48 to 83? Then as time increases, both endpoints decrease.\n\nBut note: collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on the freeway k at turn T (i.e., y_T = k) and the player's x=0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nImportant: The player is at x=0 always? The grid is 2D, but the player only moves vertically? The horizontal position is always 0? The goal is (0,9). So we are only concerned with the vertical movement and the cars that cross x=0 at the time when the player is on that freeway.\n\nAlso note: when moving from y to y+1 (or y-1) at turn T, at that turn T the player is still on the freeway y. Then at turn T+1, the player is on freeway y+1 (or y-1). So we only check the freeway we are currently on at each turn.\n\nGiven the car states at turn t1=98:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (48,83,left,36) -> span at t1: [48,83] (but wait, the problem says for left-moving: Span(t1)=[h,τ]. So h=48, τ=83? Then the car is from 48 to 83? That's a length of 35? But moving left at speed 36 per turn? That seems very fast.\n\nBut note: the update: at time T, the car is at [48-36*(T-98), 83-36*(T-98)].\n\nWe are concerned with when this car covers x=0? So we need 0 to be in [48-36*(T-98), 83-36*(T-98)].\n\nSolve: \n  48 - 36*(T-98) <= 0 <= 83 - 36*(T-98)\n\nBut note: because the car is moving left (decreasing x), and the span [a,b] with a=48-36*(T-98), b=83-36*(T-98). Since a < b, we require a<=0<=b.\n\nSo:\n  48 - 36*(T-98) <= 0  => 36*(T-98) >= 48 => T-98 >= 48/36 = 4/3 => T>= 98+2 = 100? (since T integer, T>=99.333 -> T>=100)\nand \n  0 <= 83 - 36*(T-98) => 36*(T-98) <= 83 => T-98 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 => T<=100.305 -> T<=100.\n\nSo at T=100: \n  a = 48 - 36*2 = 48-72 = -24\n  b = 83 - 36*2 = 83-72 = 11\n  Then 0 is in [-24,11] -> yes.\n\nBut note: the car is on freeway 1. So if the player is on freeway 1 at turn 100, then collision.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same car? (48,83,left,36) -> same as freeway 1? Then same: collision at turn 100 on freeway 2.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars: \n  (48,37,right,12) -> note: for right-moving, the problem says: Span(t1)=[τ, h]? Actually, the representation in the table is (head, tail, direction, speed). The update rule for right-moving: \"Span(t1)=[τ, h] -> at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nBut what is the initial span? The problem says: for right-moving, the initial span is [τ, h]. So in the data, for the first car on freeway 3: (head=48, tail=37, right,12). Then initial span is [τ, h] = [37,48]. So the car is from 37 to 48? Then at time T: [37+12*(T-98), 48+12*(T-98)].\n\nWe are concerned with when 0 is in [37+12*(T-98), 48+12*(T-98)]. But note: 37+12*(T-98) is increasing. Since 37>0, and increasing, so 0 is never in this interval? Similarly, the other cars: (12,1,right,12): initial span [1,12]. Then at T: [1+12*(T-98), 12+12*(T-98)]. This car will cover 0? \n  1+12*(T-98) <= 0 <= 12+12*(T-98)\nBut 1+12*(T-98) <=0 -> 12*(T-98)<=-1 -> T-98<=-1/12 -> T<=97. So at T=98? \n  At T=98: [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12]. And for T>98, the interval moves right, so 0 is never covered.\n\nSimilarly, the third car: (-24,-35,right,12): initial span [-35,-24]. Then at T: [-35+12*(T-98), -24+12*(T-98)]. We need:\n  -35+12*(T-98) <= 0 <= -24+12*(T-98)\nLeft: -35+12*(T-98)<=0 -> 12*(T-98)<=35 -> T-98<=35/12≈2.916 -> T<=100.916 -> T<=100\nRight: 0<=-24+12*(T-98) -> 12*(T-98)>=24 -> T-98>=2 -> T>=100.\nSo at T=100: \n  left: -35+12*2 = -35+24 = -11\n  right: -24+12*2 = -24+24=0\n  So the span is [-11,0]. Then 0 is included? [ -11, 0 ] -> 0 is the right endpoint? So collision if the player is on freeway 3 at T=100.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 4 and 5 have the same cars as freeway 3? So same behavior: collision at T=100.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (48,37,right,6) -> initial span [37,48]. Then at T: [37+6*(T-98),48+6*(T-98)]. Since 37>0 and increasing, 0 never in the span.\n\nFreeway 7: same as 6? Then safe.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars:\n  (48,37,right,6): same as above -> safe.\n  (0,-11,right,6): initial span? (head=0, tail=-11, right,6). For right-moving, initial span [τ, h] = [-11,0]. Then at T: [-11+6*(T-98), 0+6*(T-98)].\n\nWe are concerned with when 0 is in [-11+6*(T-98), 0+6*(T-98)].\nBut note: at T=98: the span is [-11,0]. Then 0 is included? So at T=98, if the player is on freeway 8, then collision.\n\nBut we start at turn 98 at y=0. So we are not on freeway 8 at turn 98. We are on y=0.\n\nNow, we need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) to go from y=0 to y=9, avoiding collisions on freeways 1-8.\n\nWe note that the minimal number of turns in terms of vertical moves: we need to go from 0 to 9, so at least 9 moves (if we only move up). But we can also move down or stay, so we might take more. However, we want minimal H.\n\nBut note: we start at turn 98 at y0=0. Then at turn 99 we can be at y=0 (if S or D? but D would go to -1, but y in [0,9] -> so D from 0: y_{t+1}=max(0,0-1)=0. Similarly, U: 0+1=1.\n\nSo from y=0, we can only go to 0 (S or D) or 1 (U).\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, we can only go to 9 (S or U) or 8 (D). But we want to end at 9.\n\nNow, we must avoid collisions. The collisions happen at specific turns on specific freeways.\n\nWe identified:\n- Freeway 1: collision at turn 100 (if player is there at turn 100)\n- Freeway 2: collision at turn 100\n- Freeway 3,4,5: collision at turn 100 (for the car that covers 0 at turn 100)\n- Freeway 8: collision at turn 98? But we are not there at 98. Also, at turn 99? \n  For freeway 8: the car (0,-11,right,6): at turn T, span = [-11+6*(T-98), 6*(T-98)].\n  At T=98: [-11,0] -> includes 0 -> collision if on freeway 8 at T=98 -> we are not.\n  At T=99: [-11+6, 6] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6] -> collision if on freeway 8 at T=99.\n  At T=100: [-11+12,12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway 8 is dangerous at T=99? Actually, at T=99: the span is [-5,6] which includes 0.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeway 8 at turn 99.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1,2,3,4,5 are dangerous at turn 100.\n\nNow, what about other freeways? \n- Freeway 6: safe (car at [37,48] and moving right, so never covers 0)\n- Freeway 7: same as 6 -> safe\n- Freeway 8: dangerous at T=99, safe at T=100 and beyond? But note there's also the other car (48,37,right,6) which is safe.\n\nSo the dangerous turns and freeways:\n- Turn 99: freeway 8 (if player is on freeway 8 at turn 99, collision)\n- Turn 100: freeways 1,2,3,4,5 (if player is on any of these at turn 100, collision)\n\nWe start at (0,0) at turn 98.\n\nWe need to be at (0,9) at some turn.\n\nLet me denote the state at turn t: the player's y-coordinate.\n\nWe have to avoid:\n- At turn 99: y=8 -> because freeway 8 is dangerous at turn 99.\n- At turn 100: y in {1,2,3,4,5} -> because freeways 1-5 are dangerous at turn 100.\n\nWe can plan:\n\nOption: go up as fast as possible? But we have to avoid the dangerous positions at specific turns.\n\nWe start:\nTurn 98: y=0.\n\nAt turn 99: we can choose to stay at 0 or go to 1? (if we go up: y=1, or stay: y=0, or down: but down from 0 stays 0).\n\nBut note: we cannot be at freeway 8 at turn 99 -> but at turn 99, we are either at 0 or 1? so not at 8. So that's safe.\n\nAt turn 100: we cannot be at freeways 1,2,3,4,5 -> so we must avoid y=1,2,3,4,5 at turn 100.\n\nSo at turn 100, we must be at y=0, or y=6,7,8,9.\n\nBut we start at y=0 at turn 98.\n\nAt turn 99: we can be at y=0 or y=1.\n\nThen at turn 100: from y=0: we can go to 0 (S or D) or 1 (U).\n          from y=1: we can go to 0 (D), 1 (S), 2 (U).\n\nBut we must not be at y=1,2,3,4,5 at turn 100.\n\nSo:\n- If at turn 99 we are at 0, then at turn 100 we can be at 0 (safe) or 1 (unsafe). So we must choose to stay at 0 at turn 100? (by doing S or D, which both yield 0).\n- If at turn 99 we are at 1, then at turn 100 we can be at 0 (safe), 1 (unsafe), 2 (unsafe). So we must choose to go down to 0.\n\nBut then at turn 100, we are at 0. Then we have to go up to 9. How?\n\nWe must avoid being at freeway 8 at turn 99? but we are not at 8 at turn 99. The next dangerous time? \n\nActually, the dangerous times we know are only turn 99 (for freeway 8) and turn 100 (for freeways 1-5). What about beyond? We need to check if there are other cars that might cause collisions at later turns.\n\nLet's check for each freeway when the cars cover 0.\n\nFreeway 1: we already saw: only at T=100? \n  The car: [48-36*(T-98), 83-36*(T-98)]\n  We solved for T=100: [-24,11] -> 0 in it.\n  T=99: [48-36,83-36] = [12,47] -> 0 not in [12,47] -> safe.\n  T=101: [48-36*3,83-36*3] = [48-108,83-108] = [-60,-25] -> 0 not in it -> safe.\n\nSo freeway 1: only dangerous at T=100.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as 1 -> only T=100.\n\nFreeway 3: we have three cars. We saw that the third car (-24,-35,right,12) is at T=100: [-11,0] -> 0 included? Actually, at T=100: \n  car3: [ -35+12*2, -24+12*2 ] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> includes 0? Yes, because it's a closed interval? The problem says \"if 0 in Span(T)\". So 0 is included.\n\nBut note: at T=100, the car is at [-11,0]. So if the player is at freeway 3 at T=100, then collision.\n\nAt T=101: \n  car3: [-35+12*3, -24+12*3] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\nThe other cars on freeway 3: \n  car1: [37+12*(T-98),48+12*(T-98)] -> at T=100: [37+24,48+24]=[61,72] -> 0 not included.\n  car2: [1+12*(T-98),12+12*(T-98)] -> at T=100: [1+24,12+24]=[25,36] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway 3: only dangerous at T=100.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4 and 5: same as 3? The table says same cars? Then same.\n\nFreeway 6: safe at all times (car never covers 0).\n\nFreeway 7: same as 6.\n\nFreeway 8: \n  car1: (48,37,right,6) -> safe (never covers 0).\n  car2: (0,-11,right,6): \n        T=98: [-11,0] -> dangerous (but we start at turn 98, and we are at y=0, not on freeway 8).\n        T=99: [-5,6] -> dangerous (covers 0).\n        T=100: [1,12] -> safe.\n        T=101: [7,18] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway 8: dangerous at T=99? and also at T=98? but we are not on it at T=98. Only T=99 is a problem if we are on freeway 8 at turn 99.\n\nNow, what about other turns? For example, freeway 8: are there other times? \n  The car covers 0 only when -11+6*(T-98) <= 0 <= 6*(T-98)\n  Solve: \n    -11+6*(T-98) <= 0 -> 6*(T-98) <= 11 -> T-98 <= 11/6 ≈ 1.833 -> T<=99.833 -> so T=99? and T=98? \n    and 0<=6*(T-98) -> T>=98.\n  So only T=98 and T=99? \n\nTherefore, beyond turn 100, the freeways 1-5 are safe? and freeway 8 is safe after turn 99.\n\nSo the only dangerous times are:\n  turn 99: freeway 8 (i.e., if we are at y=8 at turn 99 -> collision)\n  turn 100: freeways 1,2,3,4,5 (i.e., if we are at y=1,2,3,4,5 at turn 100 -> collision)\n\nNow, we are at turn 98: y=0.\n\nWe must avoid at turn 100 being at y=1,2,3,4,5.\n\nWe can plan:\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal moves: 9 moves up. But we might have to wait.\n\nAt turn 98: we can choose:\n  Option1: S or D -> stay at y=0 at turn 99.\n  Option2: U -> go to y=1 at turn 99.\n\nNow, at turn 99:\n  If we are at 0: then at turn 100, we can only be at 0 (by S or D) or 1 (by U). But we cannot be at 1 at turn 100. So we must stay at 0 at turn 100? Then we are stuck at 0 for two turns.\n\n  If we are at 1: then at turn 100, we can go to 0 (D), 1 (S), or 2 (U). But we cannot be at 1 or 2 at turn 100. So we must go to 0? Then we are back to 0 at turn 100.\n\nIn both cases, at turn 100 we are at 0.\n\nThen we have to go from 0 to 9, which takes at least 9 moves. So total turns: from turn 98 to ... we have already used 2 turns (to get to turn 100 at y=0) and then 9 more moves? So at least 11 turns? But we are at turn 100 at y=0, and we want to get to 9. Then at turn 100 we start from 0, then at turn 101: y=1, turn 102: y=2, ... turn 108: y=8, turn 109: y=9. So that would be 9 moves (from turn 100 to turn 109, so H = 11 turns? (from t1=98 to t1+H-1=109 -> H=12? Let me count: turn98, turn99, turn100, ... turn109: that's 12 turns? But we start at turn98 and we take actions from t=0 to H-1. So at turn98 (t=0), we take first action, then at turn99 (t=1), ... until turn98+H-1. We want that at turn98+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nBut we are at turn98: we are at y0=0.\n\nAfter H turns (actions taken at turns 98,99,...,98+H-1), we are at turn98+H, but the state after H actions is at turn98+H? Actually, the update: at turn98 we take action a_{t1} (which is a_{98}), then at turn99 we are at y99, then at turn100 we take the next, etc.\n\nThe goal: we want to be at (0,9) at turn98+H-1? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nSo at the end of the sequence, at turn = t1 + H - 1, we are at (0,9).\n\nWe start at turn98 (t1=98) at y=0.\n\nAfter H turns, we are at turn98+H? But the problem says: we take H actions, from t=0 to H-1, so the last action is at turn98+H-1, and then the state at turn98+H-1 is after the last action? Actually, the state is updated after the action. So:\n\nAt turn98: we start at y0=0.\nThen we apply a_{98} (which is the first action) -> then at the next turn (turn99) we are at y1.\nThen apply a_{99} -> at turn100: y2.\n...\nApply a_{98+H-1} -> at turn98+H: y_{H}.\n\nBut the problem says: we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? That would be turn98+H-1? But at turn98+H-1, we haven't taken the last action? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning the actions are taken at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the state after the last action is at turn t1+H? But the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd the answer format: \n  Turn t1: a_{t1}\n  Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n  ...\n  (presumably until the last action)\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nActually, the problem states: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we reach at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut in the dynamics, the position at turn t1+t is after the action a_{t1+t-1}? \n\nClarification: \n  At the initial turn t1, we are at (0, y_{t1}) and we take action a_{t1} to move to the next state at turn t1+1.\n\nTherefore, after taking the last action a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1, we get the state at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nNo, reread: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9)\". \n\nBut then it says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take H actions, and then we are at the goal at the end? \n\nBut the state after the last action is at turn t1+H. So we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nLet me see the problem statement: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nIt doesn't specify the turn? But then it says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and the answer format lists actions from turn t1 to ... \n\nBut the goal should be achieved at the turn after the last action? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\" and the sequence has H actions. \n\nBut note: at turn t1, we are given. Then we take action at turn t1, which moves to turn t1+1. Then at turn t1+1 we take next action, etc. After H actions, we have advanced H turns? So we are at turn t1+H? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nI think there is a confusion. \n\nLooking back: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" \n\nand then the position after the sequence is at turn t1+H? \n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", so H is the number of actions? \n\nAnd the goal is achieved at the end of the sequence, i.e., at turn t1+H? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nLet me read carefully: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nAh, yes! It says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nSo we must be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nHow does that work? \n\nAt turn t1 (start): we are at y_{t1} (given).\n\nThen we take an action a_{t1} -> this action determines y_{t1+1}.\n\nThen we take a_{t1+1} -> determines y_{t1+2}.\n\n...\n\nWe take a_{t1+H-2} -> determines y_{t1+H-1}.\n\nThen the last action? The sequence is from t=0 to H-1, meaning a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}. But then the state after a_{t1+H-1} would be y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut the goal is y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo we don't need the last action to get to 9? We are already at 9 at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThen the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, but we are already at the goal at the beginning of that turn? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nActually, the state y_t is the state at the beginning of turn t? \n\nBut the problem says: \n  \"current turn is t1\" and we are at (0, y_{t1}) at the beginning of turn t1.\n\nThen we choose an action a_{t1} for turn t1, and then the state updates to y_{t1+1} at the beginning of turn t1+1.\n\nSo the goal is to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut then we don't need to take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1, which is H actions. \n\nSo the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, which will update the state to y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut we want y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? But that action might move us away? \n\nThe problem says: we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we don't care what happens after? But we are required to provide H actions? \n\nBut we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, so we don't need to take any action at that turn? But the sequence has H actions, including one at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps I misinterpreted the indexing.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" \n\nand we want to reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut the dynamics: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, where the action a_t is taken at time t? \n\nThe problem says: \"player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_{t}\"\n\nSo the action a_t is taken at time t, and it updates the state to y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, the state y_{t} is at the beginning of turn t.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t, then we take action a_t, which leads to y_{t+1} at the beginning of turn t+1.\n\nWe are given at turn t1: y_{t1} = 0.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nThat means: we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nHow many actions do we take? \n  From turn t1 to turn t1+H-2: we take actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-2} to go from y_{t1} to y_{t1+H-1}.\n\nSo the number of actions is (H-1)? But the problem says the sequence has H actions.\n\nAlternatively, the problem says: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, so actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the state after the last action is y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut we want y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? But that action will change the state to y_{t1+H}, which might not be 9.\n\nUnless we choose S at turn t1+H-1, then y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nSo we can do that.\n\nIn other words, we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, and then we take S (stay) at turn t1+H-1, so we are still at 9 at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the goal is to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action to stay at 9? That's acceptable.\n\nBut note: the goal is achieved at turn t1+H-1, and we take an action at that turn to stay. So the minimal H might be such that we arrive at 9 at turn t1+H-1 and then we do S.\n\nNow, back to the problem.\n\nWe start at turn98: y98=0.\n\nWe want y_{98+H-1}=9.\n\nThe actions are from turn98 to turn98+H-1.\n\nThe state after action at turn98 is y99, after action at turn99 is y100, ... after action at turn98+H-2 is y_{98+H-1}, and then we take an action at turn98+H-1 to go to y_{98+H}.\n\nBut we want y_{98+H-1}=9. So by the time we get to turn98+H-1, we are already at 9? And then we take an action (probably S) to stay at 9.\n\nSo the last action is at turn98+H-1, and it doesn't change the position (if we choose S).\n\nHow do we get to 9 at turn98+H-1? \n\nWe need to take actions from turn98 to turn98+H-2 to move from 0 to 9.\n\nThe minimal number of moves to go from 0 to 9 is 9 moves (all U). But we might have to avoid dangerous positions at intermediate turns.\n\nWe know the dangerous turns: turn99 and turn100.\n\nSpecifically:\n  At turn99: if we are at y99=8, then collision (because freeway8 at turn99 is dangerous).\n  At turn100: if we are at y100 in {1,2,3,4,5}, then collision.\n\nNote: y99 is the state at the beginning of turn99, after the action at turn98.\nSimilarly, y100 is the state at the beginning of turn100, after the action at turn99.\n\nWe are at turn98: y98=0.\n\nWe take action a98 at turn98 -> y99 = 0 or 1.\n\nThen a99 at turn99 -> y100 = ... \n\nWe must avoid:\n  y99 = 8 -> collision at turn99? But we start at 0, and at turn99 we can only be at 0 or 1. So y99=8 is not possible at turn99. So no problem at turn99? \n\nBut wait, freeway8 is at y=8. If we are at y=8 at turn99, then we are on freeway8 at turn99 -> collision. But we cannot be at 8 at turn99 because we start at 0 and only one move: we can only be at 0 or 1 at turn99.\n\nSo the danger at turn99 (for freeway8) is not a threat for us at turn99 because we won't be at 8.\n\nThen the only danger is at turn100: we must avoid being at y100 in {1,2,3,4,5}.\n\nNow, at turn100, what can we be?\n  We start at turn98: y98=0.\n  turn98: a98 -> y99 = \n          if a98=U: y99=1\n          if a98=S or D: y99=0\n\n  turn99: a99 -> y100 = \n          if y99=0: \n              a99=U -> y100=1 (unsafe)\n              a99=S or D -> y100=0 (safe)\n          if y99=1:\n              a99=U -> y100=2 (unsafe)\n              a99=S -> y100=1 (unsafe)\n              a99=D -> y100=0 (safe)\n\nSo to avoid danger at turn100, we must be at y100=0.\n\nTherefore, the only safe option is to be at 0 at turn100.\n\nWe can achieve that in two ways:\n  Option A: \n      turn98: S or D -> y99=0\n      turn99: S or D -> y100=0\n  Option B:\n      turn98: U -> y99=1\n      turn99: D -> y100=0\n\nNow, we are at y100=0 at turn100.\n\nThen we need to go from 0 to 9, which takes at least 9 moves (all U). So we would be at 9 at turn100+9 = turn109.\n\nBut turn109 is the state at the beginning of turn109, which is after the actions from turn100 to turn108.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nAt turn100: y100=0.\nThen we take actions:\n  turn100: a100=U -> y101=1\n  turn101: a101=U -> y102=2\n  turn102: a102=U -> y103=3\n  turn103: a103=U -> y104=4\n  turn104: a104=U -> y105=5\n  turn105: a105=U -> y106=6\n  turn106: a106=U -> y107=7\n  turn107: a107=U -> y108=8\n  turn108: a108=U -> y109=9\n\nSo we are at y109=9 at the beginning of turn109.\n\nThis is the goal: we want y_{t1+H-1}=y_{98+H-1}=9.\n\nSo 98+H-1 = 109 -> H-1 = 11 -> H=12.\n\nAnd the last action is at turn t1+H-1 = 98+12-1=109? But we want to be at 9 at turn109, and then we take an action at turn109? But we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn109, so we take an action at turn109 to stay? \n\nBut the sequence has H=12 actions: from turn98 to turn109.\n\nBut in the above, we have actions from turn98 to turn108? That's 11 actions? \n\nLet me count the turns we take actions:\n\nWe take actions at: \n  turn98, turn99, turn100, turn101, turn102, turn103, turn104, turn105, turn106, turn107, turn108 -> 11 actions.\n\nBut we want to be at 9 at turn109, which is after the action at turn108. So we don't need an action at turn109? \n\nBut the sequence should have H actions, and we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 98+H-1.\n\nSet 98+H-1 = 109 -> H=12.\n\nSo we need 12 actions: from turn98 to turn109.\n\nBut we are at 9 at turn109, which is before taking the action at turn109. Then we take an action at turn109? But we are already at 9, and we can choose S to stay.\n\nBut in the above, we only took 11 actions to get to 9 at turn109. So we need one more action? \n\nAlternatively, we can get to 9 at turn108? \n\nBut we start at 0 at turn100. Then the earliest we can be at 9 is turn109? Because it takes 9 moves: \n  turn100:0 -> turn101:1 -> ... -> turn109:9.\n\nSo we are at 9 at turn109.\n\nThen we need to take an action at turn109? So we take 12 actions: \n  turn98,99,100,...,109.\n\nBut the state at turn109 is 9, then we take a109=S, and then at turn110 we are still at 9. \n\nBut the goal is to be at 9 at turn109? And then we take an action at turn109? That's allowed.\n\nSo the sequence of actions:\n  turn98: ... \n  turn99: ...\n  turn100: U\n  turn101: U\n  ...\n  turn108: U  (this gets us to 9 at turn109)\n  turn109: S  (to stay)\n\nBut note: at turn109, we are already at 9 (the goal) and then we take an action. So we are done.\n\nBut we must check that we don't collide during the moves from turn100 to turn109.\n\nFrom turn100 to turn109, we are moving up: y from 0 to 9.\n\nWe need to check for each turn T from 100 to 109, and for the freeway y_T, if there is a car covering 0 at that turn.\n\nWe have already analyzed the cars and we know that beyond turn100, the dangerous freeways (1-5) are safe? and freeway8 is safe after turn99.\n\nBut we need to check for each freeway we step on: freeways 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 at turns 101,102,...,109.\n\nSpecifically, we will be:\n  turn100: y100=0 -> safe (not on freeway 1-8)\n  turn101: y101=1 -> freeway1: at turn101, is there a car covering 0? \n        For freeway1: we have car: [48-36*(T-98), 83-36*(T-98)]\n        T=101: [48-36*3, 83-36*3] = [48-108,83-108] = [-60,-25] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  turn102: y102=2 -> freeway2: same car? same as freeway1? \n        T=102: [48-36*4,83-36*4] = [48-144,83-144] = [-96,-61] -> safe.\n  turn103: y103=3 -> freeway3: \n        Cars: \n          car1: [37+12*(T-98),48+12*(T-98)] -> T=103: [37+12*5,48+12*5]=[37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe.\n          car2: [1+12*(T-98),12+12*(T-98)] -> [1+60,12+60]=[61,72] -> safe.\n          car3: [-35+12*(T-98),-24+12*(T-98)] -> T=103: [-35+60, -24+60]=[25,36] -> safe.\n  turn104: y104=4 -> freeway4: same as freeway3? -> safe.\n  turn105: y105=5 -> freeway5: same -> safe.\n  turn106: y106=6 -> freeway6: \n        Car: (48,37,right,6) -> at T=106: [37+6*(106-98),48+6*8] = [37+48,48+48]=[85,96] -> safe.\n  turn107: y107=7 -> freeway7: same car? -> safe.\n  turn108: y108=8 -> freeway8: \n        Cars: \n          car1: (48,37,right,6) -> [37+6*(108-98),48+6*10]=[37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe.\n          car2: (0,-11,right,6) -> at T=108: [-11+6*(108-98), 0+6*10] = [-11+60,60]=[49,60] -> safe.\n  turn109: y109=9 -> not on freeway? safe.\n\nSo the entire path is safe.\n\nNow, we have two options to get to 0 at turn100:\n\nOption A: \n  turn98: S (or D) -> y99=0\n  turn99: S (or D) -> y100=0\n\nOption B:\n  turn98: U -> y99=1\n  turn99: D -> y100=0\n\nBoth are safe.\n\nWe can choose either. Since we want minimal H, and both lead to the same subsequent moves, H is the same.\n\nWe'll choose Option A: stay at 0 for the first two turns.\n\nThen the complete sequence:\n\nActions:\n  turn98: S\n  turn99: S\n  turn100: U\n  turn101: U\n  turn102: U\n  turn103: U\n  turn104: U\n  turn105: U\n  turn106: U\n  turn107: U\n  turn108: U\n  turn109: S   (to stay at 9)\n\nBut note: we are at 9 at turn109, and we take S at turn109 to stay. But the goal is already achieved at turn109 (before the action). However, the problem requires a sequence of H actions, and we must provide H=12 actions.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in fewer than 12 turns?\n\nWe are forced to be at 0 at turn100. Then we need 9 moves to go from 0 to 9, which takes 9 actions (from turn100 to turn108) and then we are at 9 at turn109. Then we take an action at turn109. So total actions: 2 (for turns98,99) + 9 (turns100-108) + 1 (turn109) = 12.\n\nBut note: we could get to 9 earlier if we don't have to wait? But we are forced to be at 0 at turn100.\n\nAlternatively, can we be at 9 at an earlier turn? \n\nSuppose we try to go up faster? But we cannot avoid being at 0 at turn100? \n\nWhat if we go up to 6 by turn100? Then we could be at 9 earlier? \n\nBut at turn100, we cannot be at 1,2,3,4,5. So we can only be at 0,6,7,8,9 at turn100.\n\nWe start at 0 at turn98.\n\nTo be at 6 at turn100, we would need to go up 6 in two moves? \n  turn98: U -> y99=1\n  turn99: U -> y100=2 -> but 2 is unsafe at turn100.\n\nWe cannot do that.\n\nTo be at 6: \n  We start at 0 at turn98.\n  turn98: U -> 1\n  turn99: U -> 2 -> unsafe at turn100.\n\nTo be at 7: \n  turn98: U ->1\n  turn99: U ->2 -> unsafe.\n\nTo be at 8: \n  same.\n\nTo be at 9: \n  turn98: U ->1\n  turn99: U ->2 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be above 0 at turn100 without being in danger.\n\nTherefore, we must be at 0 at turn100.\n\nThen the minimal H is 12.\n\nNow, we can choose Option A or B. Let's choose Option A (staying) for simplicity.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 98: S\nTurn 99: S\nTurn 100: U\nTurn 101: U\nTurn 102: U\nTurn 103: U\nTurn 104: U\nTurn 105: U\nTurn 106: U\nTurn 107: U\nTurn 108: U\nTurn 109: S\n\nBut wait, at turn109 we are at 9 and we do S. But the goal is achieved at turn109 (before the action). The problem requires the sequence until the last action that gets us to the goal? But we are already at the goal at turn109, and then we take an action. However, the problem says we must be at 9 at turn t1+H-1=109, and we are, so it's okay.\n\nBut note: the action at turn109 is taken, and then we are at 9 at turn110, but the goal is only required at turn109. So we could potentially stop earlier? \n\nBut the problem requires a sequence of H actions that gets us to the goal at turn t1+H-1. And we are at the goal at turn t1+H-1, and then we take the last action (which is the H-th action) at that turn. So it's consistent.\n\nHowever, we can avoid the extra action at the end if we can be at 9 at turn108? But we cannot, because we start at 0 at turn100 and it takes 9 moves to get to 9, which lands at turn109.\n\nAlternatively, if we use Option B, we have:\n\n  turn98: U\n  turn99: D -> y100=0\n\nThen the rest same.\n\nBut then we are at 0 at turn100, same as before.\n\nTotal actions still 12.\n\nBut note: in Option B, we went up and then down, which might be less efficient? But it doesn't change the total.\n\nWe'll go with Option A.\n\nBut wait: in Option A, we did two S. We could do D at turn98? \n  turn98: D -> y99=0 (since y98=0, D: max(0,0-1)=0)\n  turn99: D -> y100=0\n\nSame as S.\n\nSo we can do D or S. Let's do S.\n\nNow, the answer.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=12.\n\nIs there a way to do it in less than 12? \n\nSuppose we try to go up earlier? But we are forced to be at 0 at turn100.\n\nWhat if we go up to 1 at turn99, then down to 0 at turn100 (Option B). Then we start the ascent at turn100. Same as before.\n\nAlternatively, can we avoid being at 0 at turn100? \n\nWe must not be at 1,2,3,4,5 at turn100. So we can be at 6,7,8,9? \n\nBut to be at 6 at turn100: \n  turn98: U ->1\n  turn99: U ->2 -> unsafe at turn100? because y100=2 is in {1,2,3,4,5}? yes.\n\nSimilarly, to be at 7: we would have to be at 6 or 8 at turn99? \n  But at turn99, we start at 0 at turn98, so after one move: only 0 or 1.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=12.\n\nFinal sequence:\n\nTurn 98: S\nTurn 99: S\nTurn 100: U\nTurn 101: U\nTurn 102: U\nTurn 103: U\nTurn 104: U\nTurn 105: U\nTurn 106: U\nTurn 107: U\nTurn 108: U\nTurn 109: S\n\nBut wait, we are at turn109: we do S, and then we are at 9 at turn110. But the goal is to be at 9 at turn109? \n\nNo: we want y_{98+H-1}=9.\n\nH=12, so 98+12-1=109. We want y109=9.\n\nIn the above sequence:\n  At turn98: we do S -> then at turn99: y99=0.\n  At turn99: S -> turn100: y100=0.\n  At turn100: U -> turn101: y101=1.\n  ...\n  At turn108: U -> turn109: y109=9.\n\nSo we are at 9 at turn109, which is what we want.\n\nThen we take an action at turn109: S -> which leads to y110=9, but that's beyond the required turn.\n\nBut the problem requires a sequence of H actions, and we have provided 12 actions: from turn98 to turn109.\n\nAnd at the end of the sequence, we have taken the last action (at turn109) and we are at y110=9? \n\nBut the goal is to be at 9 at turn109, which we are (at the beginning of turn109, before the action). Then we take the action at turn109 (S) to stay, so we are at 9 at turn110, but that's not the goal turn.\n\nThis is a critical point.\n\nWe must have y109=9 at the beginning of turn109. \n\nIn our sequence:\n  After the action at turn108, we are at y109=9? \n      The action at turn108: U from y108=8 -> y109=9.\n\nSo we are at 9 at turn109. Then we take an action at turn109: S -> y110=9.\n\nBut the goal is achieved at turn109 (y109=9). The action at turn109 is taken after we have already achieved the goal.\n\nSo we do need to take that action? \n\nThe problem says: we need to provide a sequence of H actions such that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nIn our case, with H=12, we are at 9 at turn109 = 98+12-1=109.\n\nAnd we have provided 12 actions: turn98 to turn109.\n\nThe action at turn109 does not affect y109 (it affects y110), so it's okay.\n\nBut note: we must not collide at turn109? \n\nAt turn109: we are at y109=9, which is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8), so no collision.\n\nThen we take action S at turn109: no problem.\n\nSo it's valid.\n\nWe could also do nothing after we reach 9? But the sequence must have exactly H actions.\n\nSo we must provide 12 actions.\n\nBut is there a way to avoid the last S? \n\nIf we can be at 9 at turn108, then we could stop at turn108? \n\nBut we start at 0 at turn100, and we do 8 moves: \n  turn100:0->1\n  turn101:1->2\n  ...\n  turn107:7->8\n  turn108:8->9\n\nSo at turn109: y109=9.\n\nBut we want to be at 9 at turn108? \n\nThat would require that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn108, meaning that we must have arrived at turn108.\n\nBut we start at 0 at turn100. Then to be at 9 at turn108, we need 9 moves: \n  actions at turn100 to turn108: 9 actions? \n  and then we are at y109=9? \n\nNo: \n  action at turn100: from y100 to y101\n  ...\n  action at turn108: from y108 to y109.\n\nTo be at 9 at turn108: we must have y108=9.\n\nBut we start at turn100: y100=0.\n\nHow many moves? \n  From turn100 to turn108: we have 8 actions (turn100,101,...,107) to get to y108=9? \n\nBut 8 moves: we can only go up 8 units: 0 -> 8 at turn108.\n\nThen we need one more move to get to 9 at turn109.\n\nSo we cannot be at 9 at turn108.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 12.\n\nWe'll output the sequence.\n\nBut we have two choices for the first two actions: we can do (S,S) or (U,D) or (D,D), etc.\n\nWe'll choose (S,S) for simplicity.\n\nSo the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 98: S\nTurn 99: S\nTurn 100: U\nTurn 101: U\nTurn 102: U\nTurn 103: U\nTurn 104: U\nTurn 105: U\nTurn 106: U\nTurn 107: U\nTurn 108: U\nTurn 109: S\n}\n\nBut wait, at turn108: we do U to go from 8 to 9, which happens at turn109. Then at turn109 we do S. So the last action is S at turn109.\n\nWe could avoid the last S if we don't require an action after? But the problem requires H actions, and we set H=12, so we need 12 actions.\n\nAlternatively, we could do:\n\n  ... \n  turn108: S   (if we are at 9 at turn108, but we are not)\n\nBut we are at 8 at turn108? So we must do U to get to 9 at turn109.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nBut let me check if we can do without the last S? \n\nSuppose we only do 11 actions: \n  then we want to be at 9 at turn98+11-1 = 98+10=108.\n\nBut we are at 0 at turn100. Then from turn100 to turn108: 8 actions, so we can be at 8 at turn108? \n\nWe start at turn100: y100=0.\n  turn100: U -> y101=1\n  turn101: U -> y102=2\n  turn102: U -> y103=3\n  turn103: U -> y104=4\n  turn104: U -> y105=5\n  turn105: U -> y106=6\n  turn106: U -> y107=7\n  turn107: U -> y108=8\n\nSo at turn108, we are at 8. Then we need one more U to get to 9 at turn109.\n\nBut if we do 11 actions, then we stop at turn108: we have taken actions from turn98 to turn108? That's 11 actions. Then we are at y109=8? (because the last action at turn108: U from y108=8? but we are at 8 at turn108, then we do U -> y109=9. But then we are at 9 at turn109, which is turn98+11? But we want to be at 9 at turn98+H-1. With H=11, we want turn98+10. But we are at 9 at turn109=98+11, which is not 98+10.\n\nSo we need H=12.\n\nTherefore, the sequence above is minimal.\n\nWe can also do Option B for the first two:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 98: U\nTurn 99: D\nTurn 100: U\nTurn 101: U\nTurn 102: U\nTurn 103: U\nTurn 104: U\nTurn 105: U\nTurn 106: U\nTurn 107: U\nTurn 108: U\nTurn 109: S\n}\n\nBut then at turn99: we go from y99=1 to y100=0. But we have to check collision at turn99: we are at y99=1 -> freeway1. At turn99, freeway1: \n  car: [48-36*(99-98), 83-36] = [12,47] -> 0 not in, so safe.\n\nAnd at turn100: we are at 0, safe.\n\nSo this is also safe.\n\nBut it uses D, which might be less desirable? But it's valid.\n\nWe'll choose the first option.\n\nSo final answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 98: S\nTurn 99: S\nTurn 100: U\nTurn 101: U\nTurn 102: U\nTurn 103: U\nTurn 104: U\nTurn 105: U\nTurn 106: U\nTurn 107: U\nTurn 108: U\nTurn 109: S\n}\n</think>\nTo reach the goal position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn 98 in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The analysis shows that the player must avoid being on freeway 8 at turn 99 and freeways 1 to 5 at turn 100 due to car collisions. The only safe position at turn 100 is \\(y = 0\\). From there, moving up to \\(y = 9\\) takes 9 moves, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 109. The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 12, with the goal achieved at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 98 + 12 - 1 = 109\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- **Turns 98 and 99**: Stay at \\(y = 0\\) to safely reach \\(y = 0\\) at turn 100 (using \"S\" actions).\n- **Turns 100 to 107**: Move up (\"U\") to ascend from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n- **Turn 108**: Move up (\"U\") to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 109.\n- **Turn 109**: Stay (\"S\") to remain at \\(y = 9\\), satisfying the sequence length.\n\nCollision checks confirm safety:\n- Turn 99: \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not on freeway 8).\n- Turn 100: \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not on freeways 1-5).\n- Turns 101-108: Moving through freeways 1-8; car positions at these turns do not cover \\(x = 0\\).\n- Turn 109: \\(y = 9\\) (safe, not a freeway).\n\nThe minimal sequence of 12 actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 98: S\nTurn 99: S\nTurn 100: U\nTurn 101: U\nTurn 102: U\nTurn 103: U\nTurn 104: U\nTurn 105: U\nTurn 106: U\nTurn 107: U\nTurn 108: U\nTurn 109: S\n}",
