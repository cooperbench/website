        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,0) at turn t1 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe cars are moving on specific freeways. For each freeway, there are cars with positions given at turn t1, and they move left or right with constant speed. Collision happens if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The span is the segment covered by the car, and it moves over time based on speed and direction.\n\nImportant note: when the player moves to a new y-position, they are not on that freeway until the next turn. So, if at turn T, they are on y_T, and they move to y_{T+1} at the end of turn T, then during turn T, they are only considered on y_T for collision purposes. For collision at turn T, it's based on being on y_T and the cars on y_T having 0 in their span at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, the player starts at (0,0), and we need to reach (0,9), so y=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway with cars, so no cars on y=9, I assume. The freeways are y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is the starting point, and y=9 is the goal, both should be free of cars since cars are only on y=1 to y=8.\n\nNow, let's list the car states at turn t1=0.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nSince it's right-moving, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] because for right-moving, it says: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the car update: right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nBut τ is tail, h is head, so for right-moving, if at t1, span is [τ, h], meaning from tail to head, increasing.\n\nIn this case, at t1, head is -48, tail is -59? That seems odd.\n\nLet's read: \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, it says span at t1 is [τ, h], and then at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nBut here for freeway 1: head h = -48, tail τ = -59. But -48 is greater than -59, so if it's right-moving, and span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48], which makes sense because -59 to -48 is from left to right if we think of increasing x, but x=0 is the point we care about.\n\nThe player is always at x=0, so we care about when the car spans include x=0.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be decreasing.\n\nIn this case, all cars seem to have head and tail where for right-moving, head should be greater than tail if moving right, but here head is -48, tail is -59, so -48 > -59, so [τ, h] = [-59, -48], which is from left to right, so moving right, speed 3.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet me parse the car states:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h, τ, d, s) = (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nSo at t1=0, span = [τ, h] = [-59, -48] since right-moving? No.\n\nIn the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for direction: right or left.\n\nFor right-moving: at time t, span is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, at t1, span is [τ, h], so τ is left end, h is right end.\n\nIn this car, h = -48, τ = -59, so τ = -59, h = -48, so at t1, span is [-59, -48].\n\nSince moving right, at time T, span is [ -59 + 3(T - 0), -48 + 3(T - 0) ] = [ -59 + 3T, -48 + 3T ]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3) so same span movement.\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: \n1. (-48, -59, right, 4)\n2. (-12, -23, right, 4)\n3. (24, 13, right, 4)  head 24, tail 13? But 24 > 13, so for right-moving, span at t1 should be [τ, h] = [13, 24]? But it's given as (24,13), so head=24, tail=13, so τ=13, h=24, so span [13,24] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, first car: h=-48, τ=-59, span [-59,-48]\n\nSecond car: h=-12, τ=-23, span [-23,-12]? τ=-23, h=-12, so [ -23, -12 ]\n\nThird car: h=24, τ=13, so [13,24]\n\nAll right-moving, speed 4.\n\nAt time T, for first car: [ -59 + 4T, -48 + 4T ]\n\nSecond car: [ -23 + 4T, -12 + 4T ]\n\nThird car: [13 + 4T, 24 + 4T ]\n\nFreeway 5: two cars:\n1. (-48, -59, right, 12)\n2. (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: h=-48, τ=-59, so span at t1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nSecond car: h=0, τ=-11, so span [-11, 0]\n\nAt time T, first car: [ -59 + 12T, -48 + 12T ]\n\nSecond car: [ -11 + 12T, 0 + 12T ] = [ -11 + 12T, 12T ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5, two cars: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,0) at t=0. Since y=0, and no freeway at y=0, so no collision possible at y=0. Cars are only on y=1 to 8.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, which is also safe.\n\nThe player must move through y=1 to 8, but avoid being on a freeway when a car has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nAt each turn, when the player is on a certain y, we need that for that y, at that turn, no car on that freeway has 0 in its span.\n\nThe action sequence will determine when the player is on each y.\n\nSince we want minimal turns, probably we want to move up as much as possible, but we have to avoid the cars.\n\nMoving down might be necessary sometimes to wait, but since we start at 0 and need to go to 9, moving down from 0 is not possible since y=0 is the min, so Δy=0 if we try to go below, but the movement says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t with y in [0,9], so if at y=0 and we do D, y_{t+1} = 0 -1? But it must be in [0,9], so probably it stays 0 or something. Let's check.\n\nIt says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, Δy_t = -1, so y_t + (-1) = -1, but must be in [0,9], so I think it should be clamped, but it doesn't specify.\n\nLook back: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t = +1 if U, -1 if D, 0 if S, and y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\"\n\nIt says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if the move would take it outside, it should be set to the boundary, I assume. For example, at y=0, if D, y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) = 0. Similarly, at y=9, if U, y=9.\n\nIn this case, since we start at y=0, and need to go to y=9, moving down from 0 would keep us at 0, which is useless, so actions should be U or S, but S might be used to wait.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, we can only do D or S, but since we want to reach and stop, we can do S or something, but we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so at turn t1+H-1, y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nNow, the minimal H is what we want.\n\nSince the grid is small, from 0 to 9, we need at least 9 moves up to go from 0 to 9, but we can move faster by going up multiple times, but each action changes y by at most 1, so from 0 to 9, we need at least 9 U actions, and possibly some S or D if we need to wait or avoid, but D might not be useful since we can't go below 0.\n\nD might be used to go down from higher y to avoid something, but since we start low, it might not be efficient.\n\nBut let's see the car positions.\n\nFirst, I need to find when it's safe to be on each freeway y=1 to 8 at each turn.\n\nFor each freeway and each turn T, I need to check if there is a car that has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nIf not, then it's safe to be on that freeway at turn T.\n\nOtherwise, unsafe.\n\nThen the player must not be on an unsafe (y,T).\n\nThe player starts at turn 0 on y=0, which is safe.\n\nThen at each turn, based on action, moves to new y.\n\nThe sequence of positions: at turn t, y_t.\n\nFor t=0, y=0.\n\nAfter action at turn t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nCollision at turn T depends on y_T and the cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nSo for each turn T, when the player is on y_T, we need that for freeway k=y_T, at turn T, no car has 0 in span.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway, for which turns T it is unsafe, i.e., some car has 0 in span.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nCars: only one car: at T, span [ -59 + 3T, -48 + 3T ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 3T ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 3T\n\nSince -59 + 3T ≤ -48 + 3T always, but 0 must be between them.\n\nSo -59 + 3T ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 3T\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 3T ≤ 0 => 3T ≤ 59 => T ≤ 59/3 = 19.666, so T ≤ 19 since T integer\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 3T => 48 ≤ 3T => T ≥ 16\n\nSo for T from 16 to 19 inclusive, 0 is in [ -59+3T, -48+3T ]\n\nFor example T=16: [ -59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], 0 is included.\n\nT=17: [-59+51, -48+51] = [-8,3], 0 in\n\nT=18: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nT=19: [-59+57, -48+57] = [-2,9], 0 in\n\nT=20: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not <=1? 1>0, so 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSimilarly T=15: [-59+45, -48+45] = [-14,-3], 0 not in\n\nSo unsafe for T=16,17,18,19\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, since same car, so unsafe same turns T=16 to 19\n\nFreeway 3: same, unsafe T=16 to 19\n\nNow freeway 4: y=4, three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4) so span at T: [ -59 +4T, -48 +4T ]\n\n0 in span if -59+4T ≤ 0 ≤ -48+4T\n\nSo -59+4T ≤ 0 => 4T ≤ 59 => T ≤ 14.75, T≤14\n\n0 ≤ -48+4T => 48 ≤ 4T => T ≥ 12\n\nSo T from 12 to 14 inclusive.\n\nT=12: [ -59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nT=13: [-59+52, -48+52] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nT=14: [-59+56, -48+56] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nT=11: [-59+44, -48+44] = [-15,-4], 0 not in\n\nT=15: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,4) h=-12, τ=-23, so span at T: [ -23 +4T, -12 +4T ]\n\n0 in span if -23+4T ≤ 0 ≤ -12+4T\n\n-23+4T ≤ 0 => 4T ≤ 23 => T ≤ 5.75, T≤5\n\n0 ≤ -12+4T => 12 ≤ 4T => T ≥ 3\n\nSo T from 3 to 5 inclusive.\n\nT=3: [ -23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nT=4: [-23+16, -12+16] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nT=5: [-23+20, -12+20] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nT=2: [-23+8, -12+8] = [-15,-4], 0 not\n\nT=6: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,4) h=24, τ=13, so span at T: [13 +4T, 24 +4T]\n\n0 in span if 13+4T ≤ 0 ≤ 24+4T\n\nBut 13+4T ≥ 13 >0 for T≥0, so left end >0, so 0 never ≤ left end, so 0 never in span for this car.\n\nThus for freeway 4, unsafe when either first or second car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst car unsafe T=12,13,14\n\nSecond car unsafe T=3,4,5\n\nThird car always safe.\n\nSo freeway 4 unsafe at T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14\n\nNow freeway 5: y=5\n\nTwo cars:\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12) span at T: [ -59 +12T, -48 +12T ]\n\n0 in span if -59+12T ≤ 0 ≤ -48+12T\n\n-59+12T ≤ 0 => 12T ≤ 59 => T ≤ 4.916, T≤4\n\n0 ≤ -48+12T => 48 ≤ 12T => T ≥ 4\n\nSo T=4 only?

Let's see the timing.\n\nAt turn t, before action, position is y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nStart at turn 0: y_0 = 0\n\nAfter a_0, y_1 is set.\n\nAfter a_1, y_2, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_H, and we want y_H = 9.\n\nSince we start at turn 0, after H actions, we are at turn H, with y_H.\n\nWe want y_H =9.\n\nThe turns when we are on y: for each turn T from 0 to H, we are on y_T, and we need y_T safe for that T.\n\nAt turn T, we are on y_T, and for that freeway k=y_T, at turn T, it must be safe.\n\ny_T is the position at turn T.\n\nFor T=0, y_0=0, which is safe.\n\nThen for each subsequent turn, y_T must be safe.\n\nNow, if we go directly up, without stopping, we can be at y=1 at turn 1, y=2 at turn 2, ..., up to y=9 at turn 9.\n\nBut we need to check for each y and turn if safe.\n\nSince the unsafe turns are for specific y and T, we might need to adjust the timing or move slower/faster to avoid being on unsafe (y,T) pairs.\n\nFor example, at turn 0, if we go to y=1, at turn 1 we are on y=1.\n\nBut for y=1, it is unsafe only at T=16-19, which are later turns, so at turn 1, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2,3 same.\n\ny=4 is unsafe at T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 unsafe at T=0 and T=4.\n\nT=0 is the start, but we are on y=0 at T=0, not on freeway.\n\nLet's list for each turn T, which y are unsafe.\n\nBut y depends on the path.\n\nSince we want minimal H, and H at least 9, let's try H=9.\n\nWith H=9, we reach y_9=9.\n\nThe path: y_t for t=0 to 9.\n\nt=0: y=0, safe\n\nt=1: y=1, need to check if safe. For y=1, unsafe only at T=16-19, t=1<16, so safe.\n\nSimilarly t=2: y=2, safe\n\nt=3: y=3, for y=3, unsafe at T=16-19, t=3<16, safe\n\nt=4: now y=4? If we go up each time.\n\ny=4 at t=4.\n\nBut for y=4, unsafe at T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14.\n\nSo at T=4, y=4 is unsafe, since T=4 is in {3,4,5}.\n\nSo if we are on y=4 at turn 4, collision.\n\nTherefore, with direct up, at t=4, y=4, but unsafe.\n\nSo we need to avoid that.\n\nSimilarly, at t=0, y=0 safe.\n\nt=1, y=1 safe\n\nt=2, y=2 safe\n\nt=3, y=3 safe\n\nt=4, if y=4, unsafe\n\nBut we can change the action.\n\nFor example, at some turns, we can stay or move down, but since we start low, moving down might not help.\n\nWe can delay moving to y=4.\n\nFor instance, at turn 3, instead of moving to y=4, we can stay on y=3 or move down, but y=3 is safe at t=3, since unsafe only later.\n\ny=3 unsafe at T=16-19, t=3<16, safe.\n\nSo at t=3, if we do S, stay on y=3, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=4, we can move to y=4 or something else.\n\nBut y=4 at t=4 is unsafe, so we should not be on y=4 at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, at t=5, y=4 is unsafe if we are there, since T=5 is also unsafe for y=4.\n\nT=5 is unsafe for y=4.\n\nBut let's list the unsafe (y,T) pairs:\n\nFor y=4: unsafe at T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14\n\nBut T=3: if we are on y=4 at T=3, unsafe. But in the path, if we go directly, at T=3 we might be on y=3 or y=4.\n\nLet's think of the turn when we are on each y.\n\nSince we need to pass through each y from 1 to 8, but not necessarily at turn t, we can be on a y at different times.\n\nFor minimal H, we probably want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid the unsafe points.\n\nNow, for y=5,6,7,8, they are unsafe at T=0 and T=4.\n\nT=0 is past, we are at y=0.\n\nT=4 is a problem.\n\nAt T=4, if we are on y=5,6,7, or 8, it is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, for y=4, unsafe at T=3,4,5.\n\nSo around T=4, it's dangerous for multiple y.\n\nSpecifically, at T=4:\n\n- If on y=4, unsafe\n\n- If on y=5, unsafe\n\n- If on y=6, unsafe\n\n- If on y=7, unsafe\n\n- If on y=8, unsafe\n\n- If on y=1,2,3, safe since unsafe only later\n\n- y=0 safe, y=9 safe but not reached yet.\n\nSo at T=4, the only safe y are 0,1,2,3,9 (but 9 not reached).\n\nSimilarly, at T=3: for y=4 unsafe, others: y=5 unsafe? y=5 unsafe at T=0 and T=4, not T=3, so y=5 safe at T=3.\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8 safe at T=3 except for their unsafe times.\n\nLet's list for each T, which y are unsafe.\n\nT=0: y=5,6,7,8 unsafe (since for y=5, unsafe at T=0, etc.)\n\nBut at T=0, we are on y=0, which is safe, so no issue.\n\nT=1: no y unsafe? y=1 unsafe at T=16-19, not T=1. Similarly others, only y=5,6,7,8 have unsafe at T=0 and T=4, not T=1. y=4 unsafe at T=3,4,5, not T=1. So at T=1, all y safe? y=1,2,3 safe, y=4 safe at T=1, y=5 safe at T=1, etc.\n\nSimilarly T=2: same, all y safe except possibly, but no unsafe at T=2.\n\nT=3: y=4 unsafe (since T=3 in unsafe for y=4), and y=5,6,7,8 safe at T=3? y=5 unsafe only at T=0 and T=4, so at T=3 safe. Similarly others.\n\nSo at T=3, only y=4 is unsafe.\n\nT=4: y=4,5,6,7,8 all unsafe.\n\ny=4 unsafe, y=5 unsafe, etc.\n\nT=5: y=4 unsafe (since T=5), and y=5,6,7,8 safe? y=5 unsafe at T=0 and T=4, not T=5, so y=5 safe at T=5. Similarly y=6,7,8 safe. But y=4 unsafe at T=5.\n\nT=6 to T=11: all safe, since no unsafe times except later.\n\nT=12: y=4 unsafe (T=12)\n\nT=13: y=4 unsafe\n\nT=14: y=4 unsafe\n\nT=15: all safe? y=4 unsafe at T=12,13,14, not 15. y=1,2,3 unsafe at T=16-19, not yet.\n\nT=16: y=1,2,3 unsafe\n\nT=17: same\n\nT=18: same\n\nT=19: same\n\nT=20 and later: all safe.\n\nBack to minimal path.\n\nWe start at t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nIf we go directly up, at t=1 y=1, t=2 y=2, t=3 y=3, t=4 y=4 but unsafe at t=4.\n\nSo we need to avoid being at y=4 at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be at y=5,6,7,8 at t=4 either.\n\nAt t=4, we must be on y=0,1,2, or 3.\n\nSince we are at y=3 at t=3 (if we went up), we can stay at y=3 for t=4.\n\nOr move down, but y=3 down to y=2, but y=2 is also safe at t=4.\n\nBut moving down might waste time.\n\nSo perhaps at t=3, we are at y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=3, we do S (stay), so at t=4, y=3 (since we stay, y_{t+1} = y_t if S).\n\nAction at turn t: if S, Δy=0, so y_{t+1} = y_t.\n\nSo at t=3, if we do S, y_4 = y_3 = 3.\n\nThen at t=4, we are on y=3, which is safe, since y=3 unsafe only at T=16-19.\n\nThen at t=4, we can do U to go to y=4.\n\nBut at t=5, we would be on y=4? Let's see.\n\nAfter action at t=4, if we do U, y_5 = y_4 +1 = 3+1=4.\n\nThen at turn t=5, we are on y=4.\n\nBut for y=4, T=5 is unsafe, since T=5 in {3,4,5}.\n\nSo at t=5, on y=4, unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf at t=4 we stay on y=3, then y_5=3.\n\nThen at t=5, we can go to y=4.\n\nBut at t=5, on y=4, unsafe as above.\n\nT=5 is unsafe for y=4.\n\nWe need to be on y=4 at a safe time.\n\ny=4 is unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nSo safe for T<3 or 5<T<12 or T>14.\n\nSince T=0,1,2,6,7,8,9,10,11,15,...\n\nBut we are at t=3, y=3, we need to go to y=4.\n\nAt t=3, we cannot go to y=4 because if we do U at t=3, y_4 = y_3 +1 =3+1=4, so at t=4, on y=4, unsafe.\n\nIf we do S at t=3, y_4=3.\n\nThen at t=4, we can do U, y_5=4, but at t=5, on y=4, unsafe.\n\nIf we do S at t=4, y_5=3, then at t=5, do U, y_6=4, then at t=6, on y=4.\n\nNow t=6, is it safe? For y=4, T=6, not in unsafe times, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=6 is between 5 and 12, so safe.\n\nYes.\n\nSo we can delay moving to y=4 until t=6.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut we also have the issue at t=4 for other y, but since we are not on high y, it's ok.\n\nLet's outline a path.\n\nStart t=0, y=0\n\nAction a0: U, so y1=1 (at turn 1, y=1)\n\na1: U, y2=2\n\na2: U, y3=3\n\nNow at t=3, y=3, need to avoid going to y=4 immediately.\n\nSo a3: S, so y4=3 (stay at y=3)\n\nThen at t=4, y=3, safe.\n\nNow at t=4, we can do S again or U.\n\nIf we do U, y5=4, but then at t=5, y=4, unsafe.\n\nSo we should not do U at t=4.\n\nDo S at t=4: a4=S, y5=3\n\nThen at t=5, y=3, safe.\n\nNow do U: a5=U, y6=4\n\nAt t=6, y=4, and T=6, which is safe for y=4.\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\na6: U, y7=5\n\nAt t=7, y=5.\n\nFor y=5, unsafe at T=0 and T=4, but T=7 not unsafe, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, a7: U, y8=6\n\nt=8, y=6, safe (unsafe only T=0,4)\n\na8: U, y9=7\n\nt=9, y=7, safe\n\na9: U, y10=8\n\nt=10, y=8, safe\n\na10: U, y11=9\n\nNow at t=11, y=11? y=9, and we reached.\n\nBut y=9 is goal, safe.\n\nNow, we reached at turn 11, with y11=9.\n\nBut is this minimal? We had to wait two turns at y=3.\n\nH is the number of turns? Let's see.\n\nWe have actions from t=0 to t=10, that's 11 actions, and after 11 actions, y11=9.\n\nt from 0 to 10, that's 11 turns? Turn indices.\n\nStart at turn 0.\n\nAfter action a_t, at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence: at turn 0, position before action, y0=0.\n\nAfter a0, position at turn 1 is y1.\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{H-1}, position at turn H is y_H.\n\nWe want y_H =9.\n\nIn this case, with actions from t=0 to t=10? Let's count the turns.\n\nAfter k actions, we are at turn k.\n\nAt turn 0, before any action, y0=0.\n\nAfter first action a0, at turn 1, y1.\n\nAfter second action a1, at turn 2, y2.\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at turn H, y_H.\n\nWe want y_H =9.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nt=0: y0=0\n\na0=U → y1=1\n\nt=1: y1=1\n\na1=U → y2=2\n\nt=2: y2=2\n\na2=U → y3=3\n\nt=3: y3=3\n\na3=S → y4=3  (since S, y4=y3=3)\n\nt=4: y4=3\n\na4=S → y5=3\n\nt=5: y5=3\n\na5=U → y6=4\n\nt=6: y6=4\n\na6=U → y7=5\n\nt=7: y7=5\n\na7=U → y8=6\n\nt=8: y8=6\n\na8=U → y9=7\n\nt=9: y9=7\n\na9=U → y10=8\n\nt=10: y10=8\n\na10=U → y11=9\n\nAt turn 11, y11=9, so we reached at turn 11.\n\nH=11 turns? From turn 0 to turn 11, but turn 11 is after 11 actions.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=0 to t=10, that's 11 actions, to reach y11=9.\n\nMinimal possible is 9, but we used 11.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer?\n\nWe could go faster or avoid waiting.\n\nAnother idea: at t=4, since we are at y=3, we could move down? But to what? If we move down to y=2, then at t=5, y=2, then we have to go up again, which might take more time.\n\nFor example, at t=4, if we do D, but y=3, do D, y5 = y4 -1 =3-1=2? But at t=4, position is y4=3 (if we stayed), do a4=D, then y5=2.\n\nThen at t=5, y=2, then we need to go back up, which is worse.\n\nSo staying is better.\n\nBut we have to wait until t=6 to be on y=4 safely.\n\nt=6 is safe.\n\nBut we also have later unsafe times, like for y=4 at T=12,13,14, but since we go through quickly, it should be fine.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=4 at t=6, which is before 12, safe.\n\nThen we go up to y=5 at t=7, etc.\n\nBut y=5,6,7,8 are unsafe only at T=4, which is past, so no issue.\n\nNow, but we have to reach y=9, and we used 11 turns.\n\nBut perhaps we can go slower at the beginning or something.\n\nAnother thought: since at t=0, we are at y=0, we can stay for some turns.\n\nBut staying at y=0 doesn't help, because we need to go up eventually.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=0 for a turn: a0=S, then y1=0, still at turn 1, y=0.\n\nThen we can start going up.\n\nBut at turn 1, y=0, safe.\n\nThen a1=U, y2=1, and so on.\n\nBut we are one turn behind, so it would take even longer.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up to y=3 at t=3, and we need to wait until t=6 to be on y=4, so we must spend at least two extra turns somewhere.\n\nBut we can be on y=4 at t=2 or earlier, but let's see.\n\nt=2: if we are on y=4 at t=2, is it safe?\n\nFor y=4, unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nT=2 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=1, T=0 also safe, but we can't be on y=4 that early.\n\nAt t=0, y=0\n\nt=1, y=1 if we go up\n\nt=2, y=2 if go up\n\nt=3, y=3 if go up\n\nTo be on y=4 at t=2, we need to be at y=4 at turn 2.\n\nFrom start: at t=0, y=0, if a0=U, y1=1\n\nt=1, y=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nTo be at y=4 at t=2, impossible because at t=2, y=2 max if we go up twice.\n\ny2=2, so at turn 2, y=2.\n\nCannot be higher earlier.\n\nEarliest to be on y=4 is at turn 4 if we go up directly: y4=4 at t=4.\n\nBut unsafe.\n\nOr we can be later, like t=6 as before.\n\nBut at t=1, if we are on y=1, we can only go to y=0,1,2.\n\nCannot jump.\n\nSo the only safe times for y=4 are T=0,1,2,6,7,8,9,10,11,15,...\n\nBut T=0,1,2: we can only reach y=4 at earliest t=4, so T=0,1,2 not achievable.\n\nSimilarly, T=6 to 11 are achievable, or later.\n\nIn our path, we are at t=6.\n\nT=6 is fine.\n\nNow, for the higher freeways, y=5 to 8, they have unsafe at T=4, but since we are not on them at T=4, it's ok.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=5 at t=7, which is after T=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut we have 11 turns to reach y=9.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster by not going up to y=3 immediately.\n\nFor example, stay at y=0 for a turn, but that seems worse.\n\nOr, after reaching y=3, instead of waiting, we can go to another y.\n\nBut y=2 and y=3 are safe at t=4, but we need to go up eventually.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5,6,7,8 are safe except at T=4, and we can be on them at other times.\n\nBut in the direct path, we are on them after t=4.\n\nIn our delayed path, we are on y=5 at t=7, etc.\n\nBut we can be on y=5 earlier? For example, if we could be on y=5 at t=5, but to be on y=5 at t=5, we need to be at y=5 at turn 5.\n\nFrom start: t=0 y=0, a0=U y1=1\n\na1=U y2=2\n\na2=U y3=3\n\na3=U y4=4 but unsafe at t=4 if we do that.\n\nIf we do a3=S, y4=3, then a4=U, y5=4, but at t=5 y=4 unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=4 at t=4 or t=5 if we want to go up.\n\nBut at t=4, we can be on y=2 or something.\n\nFor instance, at t=2, y=2, we can do S or D.\n\nSuppose we go up to y=2 at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, y=2, a2=S, y3=2\n\nThen at t=3, y=2, a3=U, y4=3\n\nThen at t=4, y=3, a4=U, y5=4 but at t=5 y=4 unsafe? t=5 on y=4 unsafe.\n\na4=S, y5=3, then a5=U y6=4, same as before.\n\nIf at t=3, y=2, we do U to y=3, then same.\n\nTo be on y=4 at t=6, we need to have y5=3 or 4 or 5, but if y5=4, at t=5 unsafe.\n\nSo we must have y5 not 4, and y6=4.\n\nSo y5 must be 3 or 5.\n\nBut from y=3, we can go to y=4.\n\nFrom y=5, but we are not at y=5 yet.\n\nAt t=4, we are at y=3 or less.\n\nSuppose at t=4, we are at y=3, then to have y6=4, we need y5 such that from y5, we go to y6=4.\n\nSo y5 must be 3,4, or 5.\n\nIf y5=3, then a5=U, y6=4\n\nIf y5=4, then a5=S or D, but if S, y6=4, if D, y6=3 then not to 4 directly.\n\nBut y5=4 at t=5 is unsafe, so we cannot be on y=4 at t=5.\n\nTherefore, y5 cannot be 4, so y5 must be 3 or 5.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at t=5, we need to have reached y=5 by then.\n\nFor example, at t=4, if we are at y=4, but at t=4 y=4 unsafe, not possible.\n\nIf at t=4, y= something else.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at t=5, we need y4=4 or 5 or 6, but y4=4 unsafe at t=4, y4=5 or 6 not possible since at t=4 we are at most y=4 if we go fast.\n\nMax at t=4 is y=4.\n\nSo y4 <=4.\n\nThus to have y5=5, we need y4=4 or 5, but y4=5 impossible, so y4=4, then a4=U, y5=5.\n\nBut y4=4 at t=4 unsafe, cannot.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be on y=5 at t=5.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on high y early.\n\nThe earliest we can be on y=4 safely is t=6, as before.\n\nThen y=5 at t=7, etc.\n\nSo with 11 turns, it seems necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can be on y=4 at t=1 or something, impossible.\n\nPerhaps we can skip some y by moving faster, but we can only change by 1 each turn, so we must visit each y from 0 to 9 sequentially, but not necessarily, we can go down, but since we start low, we probably go up directly except for waiting.\n\nIn this case, we have to go through each integer y.\n\nBut we can stay or move down, but moving down would require going up again, increasing turns.\n\nSo minimal should be with no down moves, only up and stay.\n\nIn our case, we used two stays.\n\nNow, but we have later unsafe times for y=1,2,3 at T=16-19, but since we go early, before T=16, it should be fine.\n\nSimilarly for y=4 at T=12-14, but we are on y=4 at t=6, which is before 12, safe.\n\nNow, another thing: for freeway 4, there is a car at T=3,4,5 unsafe, but we avoided that.\n\nNow, in our path, we reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut let's write the action sequence.\n\nt from t1=0.\n\nWe need actions a_t for t=0 to H-1, such that after H actions, y_H=9.\n\nIn this case, H=11 actions.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 0: a0 = U  // to y1=1\n\nTurn 1: a1 = U  // to y2=2\n\nTurn 2: a2 = U  // to y3=3\n\nTurn 3: a3 = S  // to y4=3 (stay)\n\nTurn 4: a4 = S  // to y5=3 (stay)\n\nTurn 5: a5 = U  // to y6=4\n\nTurn 6: a6 = U  // to y7=5\n\nTurn 7: a7 = U  // to y8=6\n\nTurn 8: a8 = U  // to y9=7\n\nTurn 9: a9 = U  // to y10=8\n\nTurn 10: a10 = U // to y11=9\n\nNow, at turn 11, y=9, reached.\n\nIs there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose we reach at turn 10, y10=9.\n\nThen y10=9, so at some point we must have gone up faster.\n\nBut to have y10=9, we need to have done 9 up moves and possibly some stay or down, but down would require more up, so net, we need at least 9 up moves.\n\nIf we have one down move, we need an extra up, so more actions.\n\nThus minimal actions with only up and stay: 9 up and k stays, total actions 9 + k, reaching at turn 9+k.\n\nWith k=0, turn 9, but we couldn't because of collision at t=4.\n\nWith k=2, turn 11 as above.\n\nCan we do with k=1?\n\nThat is, only one stay, reach at turn 10.\n\ny10=9.\n\nNow, with one stay, we have 9 up and one stay, so 10 actions.\n\nThe stay must be at some y where we can afford to wait.\n\nBut in the critical part, around t=4.\n\nSuppose we insert the stay earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=0, do S, then y1=0.\n\nThen a1=U y2=1\n\na2=U y3=2\n\na3=U y4=3\n\na4=U y5=4 but at t=5 y=4 unsafe? t=5 on y=4, T=5 unsafe.\n\nIf we go up to y=3 at t=3, then at t=3 do S, y4=3\n\nThen a4=U y5=4, at t=5 y=4 unsafe.\n\nSame.\n\nAfter y=3, at t=3, we do U to y4=4, but at t=4 y=4 unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nPerhaps we can be on a different y at t=4.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=2, y=2, we do D? But why.\n\na2=D, then y3=1\n\nThen at t=3, y=1, a3=U y4=2\n\nThen at t=4, y=2, a4=U y5=3\n\nThen a5=U y6=4 at t=6, same as before, but we used extra actions: from t=2 to t=4, we went down and up, so we have two extra actions to go from y=2 to y=2, net zero, but we lost progress.\n\nThen at t=6 y=4, etc., but we reach later.\n\nWorse.\n\nThus, with one stay, we cannot avoid the unsafe at t=4 or t=5 for y=4.\n\nUnless we can be on y=4 at t=6 with only one stay, but to reach y=4 at t=6, we need to have y6=4.\n\nWith minimal up, we can be at y=4 at t=4 with 4 up, or at t=5 with 4 up and one action, but with actions: after 4 actions, at turn 4, y=4 if all U.\n\nIf we have one S, after 5 actions, y=4 if we had one S and three U, but positions: e.g., a0=U y1=1, a1=S y2=1, a2=U y3=2, a3=U y4=3, a4=U y5=4, then at t=5 y=4 unsafe.\n\nIf the stay is later, but we need y6=4.\n\nWith 4 up and 2 other actions, but we have only one stay, so if one stay and 4 up, after 5 actions, y=4 or less.\n\nAfter 5 actions: if 4U and 1S, depending when S.\n\nIf S early, y lower.\n\nFor example, a0=S y1=0, a1=U y2=1, a2=U y3=2, a3=U y4=3, a4=U y5=4, then at t=5 y=4 unsafe.\n\na0=U y1=1, a1=U y2=2, a2=S y3=2, a3=U y4=3, a4=U y5=4, same.\n\na0=U y1=1, a1=U y2=2, a2=U y3=3, a3=S y4=3, a4=U y5=4, at t=5 y=4 unsafe.\n\nAlways at t=5 y=4 if we reach by then, but unsafe.\n\nTo be at y=4 at t=6, we need after 6 actions y=4? Turn after actions.\n\nAt turn t, after t actions? Turn 0: before action.\n\nAfter a0, turn 1 y1.\n\nAfter a5, turn 6 y6.\n\nIf y6=4, then at turn 6, on y=4.\n\nTo have y6=4, we must have done actions such that net up 4, with possible stays or down.\n\nWith one stay, we can have 4 up and one stay, total 5 actions to reach y=4 at turn 5? After 5 actions, turn 5 y5.\n\ny5=4 with 4U and one S, but as above, at turn 5 y=4 unsafe.\n\nWith no stay, y5=5 with 5U, but at turn 5 y=5, for y=5, unsafe at T=0 and T=4, not T=5, so safe, but to reach y=5 at t=5, we need y4=4 and a4=U, but y4=4 at t=4 unsafe, cannot.\n\nThus, impossible to reach y=4 or higher by t=5 safely with fewer than 2 waits.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, but we also have to check the other unsafe times, like for y=4 at T=12,13,14, but in our path we are on y=4 at t=6, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, for y=1,2,3 at T=16-19, we are on them at t=1,2,3, early, safe.\n\nNow, in the sequence, when we go to y=5 at t=7, etc., all safe.\n\nNow, but for freeway 5,6,7,8, they have cars, but unsafe only at T=0 and T=4, which are not when we are on them.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=5 at t=7, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, the player must avoid collisions, which we did.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions:\n\nFrom t=0 to t=10.\n\nt=0: U\n\nt=1: U\n\nt=2: U\n\nt=3: S\n\nt=4: S\n\nt=5: U\n\nt=6: U\n\nt=7: U\n\nt=8: U\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U\n\nIn the sequence, at t=5: U to y6=4\n\nt=6: U to y7=5\n\n...\n\nt=10: U to y11=9\n\ny11=9 at turn 11.\n\nBut t=10 is the last action.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be for turns starting from t1=0.\n\nThe actions are for turn t, a_t.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAfter Turn 10 action, we are at turn 11, y=9.\n\nH=11 turns? The number of actions is 11.\n\nIn the problem, it says \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt1=0, so {a_t for t=0 to H-1}\n\nAnd after that, y_H =9.\n\nHere, with H=11, actions from t=0 to t=10, y11=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 11 actions.\n\nBut in the output, it should list each turn and action.\n\nNow, but let's confirm if we can reach with H=10.\n\nSuppose we do only one stay.\n\nFor example, at t=3, we do S, so y4=3.\n\nThen at t=4, we must not go to y=4 because if U, y5=4 at t=5 unsafe.\n\nBut we can go to y=5? From y=3, we can only go to y=2,3,4.\n\nCannot go to y=5 directly.\n\nSo at t=4, if we do U, y5=4 unsafe.\n\nIf do S, y5=3, then at t=5, do U, y6=4 at t=6 safe, but we used two stays: one at t=3 and one at t=4? No, at t=3 S, at t=4 S, that's two.\n\nWith one stay: suppose at t=4, we are at y=3 (after a3=S at t=3? But that's two actions.\n\nStart: t=0 y=0, a0=U y1=1\n\na1=U y2=2\n\na2=U y3=3\n\nNow, with one stay: if we do a3=S, then y4=3\n\nThen a4 must be U or S or D.\n\nIf a4=U, y5=4 at t=5 unsafe.\n\nIf a4=S, y5=3, then a5=U y6=4 at t=6 safe, but we used two stays: a3=S and a4=S.\n\na3=S and a4=S are two separate stay actions.\n\nWith only one stay in total, meaning only one S action.\n\nThen we must have 9 U actions and one S, total 10 actions.\n\nThen y10=9 at turn 10.\n\nTo have y10=9, we need to be at y=9 at turn 10.\n\nSince we start y=0, after 10 actions with 9U and 1S, the S must be at some point.\n\nSuppose the S is at low y, say at t=0, a0=S, y1=0\n\nThen a1=U y2=1\n\n...\n\na9=U y10=9? After 10 actions.\n\nFrom a0 to a9, 10 actions.\n\na0=S: y1=0\n\na1=U: y2=1\n\na2=U: y3=2\n\na3=U: y4=3\n\na4=U: y5=4 but at t=5 y=4 unsafe.\n\na4=U to y5=4, but turn 5.\n\nSimilarly, if S later.\n\nSuppose a0=U y1=1\n\na1=U y2=2\n\na2=U y3=3\n\na3=U y4=4 but at t=4 y=4 unsafe, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\na3=S: but then a3=S y4=3\n\nThen a4=U y5=4 at t=5 unsafe.\n\nIf after a3=S, y4=3, then a4 must be something to avoid y=4 at unsafe time.\n\nBut with only 10 actions, we need to reach y=9 at turn 10.\n\nAfter a4, y5, must be less than or equal to 5, etc.\n\nBut to reach y=9 in 10 actions with one S, we must have 9 U and one S, so the position increases by 9, but with one delay.\n\nAt some turn, we are not moving up.\n\nBut specifically, at turn 5, y5 must be defined.\n\nSince we have one S, y5 could be from 4 to 5, but if y5=4, unsafe; if y5=5, we need to be at y=5 at turn 5, which requires y4=4 or 5, but y4=4 at t=4 unsafe, y4=5 impossible.\n\nThus y5 cannot be 4 or 5 safely.\n\ny5 could be 3, for example, if we stayed at some point.\n\nBut if y5=3, then to reach y=9 at turn 10, we need to go up 6 times in 5 actions, which requires 6 U, but with only 5 actions left? From turn 5 to turn 10, 5 actions: a5 to a9.\n\nAfter a5, y6; ... after a9, y10.\n\nIf at turn 5, y5=3, then after a5 to a9, 5 actions, to reach y10=9, we need net +6 in y, but each action can increase y by at most 1, so maximum y10 = y5 +5 =3+5=8, which is less than 9.\n\nCannot reach y=9.\n\nIf y5=4, but unsafe.\n\nIf y5=5, impossible or unsafe.\n\nThus, with one S, we cannot reach y=9 by turn 10; either we get stuck or have collision.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, we have two S actions at t=3 and t=4.\n\nBut in terms of the actions, it's fine.\n\nNow, the answer should list the actions from turn t1=0 to turn t1+H-1, which is turn 0 to turn 10 for H=11.\n\nIn the boxed format.\n\nAlso, we need to output the sequence.\n\nBut let's make sure there are no other constraints.\n\nFor example, when going to y=5 at t=7, is it safe? Freeway y=5, at T=7, unsafe only at T=0 and T=4, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlso, the car on freeway 5 at second car, at T=0 it was at [ -11,0], but at T=7, span [ -11 +12*7, 12*7] = [ -11+84, 84] = [73,84], not near 0.\n\nSimilarly first car far away.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nBut in the output, it should be written as:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAnd H=11.\n\nBut in the answer format, it might just list the actions without specifying H, but the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nBut in the box, it should have the sequence with turns.\n\nPerhaps H is implied.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 4, there is a car at (24,13,right,4), which we said never covers 0, but just to confirm, span [13+4T,24+4T], min 13>0, so yes.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nI think this should work.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,0), and we need to reach (0,9), which we do.\n\nNow, the sequence has actions from t=0 to t=10.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 10, we do U to reach y=9 at turn 11.\n\nBut turn 11 is not part of the actions; the last action is at turn 10.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nPerhaps we can start with stay, but it won't save time.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 11. This requires a sequence of 11 actions from turn 0 to turn 10, resulting in the player being at \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed to avoid unsafe positions at critical turns, particularly around turn 4 where multiple freeways are unsafe. Specifically:\n- Freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3\\) are unsafe at turns \\(T = 16\\) to \\(19\\).\n- Freeway \\(y = 4\\) is unsafe at turns \\(T = 3, 4, 5\\) and \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\).\n- Freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are unsafe at turns \\(T = 0\\) and \\(T = 4\\).\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) at turn 0. The sequence moves up to \\(y = 3\\) by turn 3, then stays at \\(y = 3\\) for turns 4 and 5 to avoid being on \\(y = 4\\) or higher during unsafe turns (e.g., at turn 4, \\(y = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are all unsafe).

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 2) at turn t_1 = 2. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each turn, the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where there's a car such that 0 is in the car's span at that turn. The key point is that when moving, you're not on the new freeway until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and at T+1 you're on y+1.\n\nNow, the car states are given for turn t_1=2. For each freeway and each car, we have head, tail, direction, and speed. I need to model where these cars are at future turns relative to t_1.\n\nThe car update: for a car, at turn T > t_1, the span changes based on direction and speed.\n\nFor left-moving cars (which I think means moving left, so decreasing x), but in the span, it's given as [h, τ] for left-moving? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, both head and tail decrease by s per turn.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], with h and τ, but it doesn't specify which is larger. Typically for a car, head might be the front, but in terms of position, for left-moving, if it's moving left, the head should have smaller x if x decreases left? I need to be careful with coordinates.\n\nThe freeway is a horizontal line, I assume x from left to right, so decreasing x means moving left.\n\nFor left-moving car: direction left, so at turn t_1, span [h, τ]. After T - t_1 turns, it moves left by s per turn, so the positions decrease by s(T-t_1).\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, it increases.\n\nIn the car state table, for each car, it's given (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nBut head and tail, which one is left or right? It doesn't specify, but from the span, for left-moving, [h, τ], and it moves to [h - sΔ, τ - sΔ], so if it's moving left, h and τ both decrease, so probably for left-moving, h is the right end or something? I'm confused.\n\nLet's look at the values.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3)\n\nDirection is right, so it should be moving right.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), but in the span definition, for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], with [τ, h] meaning from τ to h, and since it's moving right, τ and h increase.\n\nBut in the tuple, it's (head, tail), so which is which?\n\nFor freeway 1: head = -42, tail = -53, dir = right.\n\nIf dir is right, and it's moving right, the span should be from left to right, I think.\n\nAssume that for a car, tail is the back, head is the front.\n\nIf direction is right, head is the front, so x_head > x_tail, and as it moves right, both increase.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: head = -42, tail = -53, since -42 > -53, so head is at -42, tail at -53, so the span is from x= -53 to x= -42, I think? But in the span notation, for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], with τ and h, and it moves to [τ + sΔ, h + sΔ].\n\nIn the text: for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd for left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nNow, in the car state, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed).\n\nFor a right-moving car, since it's moving right, the head (front) should have higher x than tail (back), so for example, freeway 1: head = -42, tail = -53, dir = right. Since -42 > -53, head at -42, tail at -53, so the car spans from x= -53 to x= -42 at t_1.\n\nThen for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-53, -42], and at time T, it becomes [ -53 + s(T-t_1), -42 + s(T-t_1) ]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, if there was one, but in this case, all are right-moving except possibly some.\n\nLet's list all cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-42, -53, right, 3) so s=3\n\nFreeway 2: same, (-42, -53, right, 3)\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-42, -53, right, 3)\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: (-40, -51, right, 4), (-4, -15, right, 4), (32, 21, right, 4)\n\nFor the last one, (32, 21, right, 4), head=32, tail=21, 32 > 21, so tail=21, head=32, span from 21 to 32.\n\nSimilarly, first car: head=-40, tail=-51, -40 > -51, span from -51 to -40.\n\nSecond car: head=-4, tail=-15, -4 > -15, span from -15 to -4.\n\nFreeway 5: (-24, -35, right, 12) and (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nFirst: head=-24, tail=-35, -24 > -35, span from -35 to -24\n\nSecond: head=24, tail=13, 24>13, span from 13 to 24\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5, (-24, -35, right, 12), (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nAll cars are right-moving, no left-moving mentioned.\n\nt_1 = 2, so for any future turn T, we need to find if at x=0, for a given freeway y and turn T, if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nCollision if at turn T, player is on y_T, and for that y, at turn T, there is a car such that 0 ∈ span(T).\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at t=2.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, but y=9 is the top, no freeway, so no cars, so once at y=9, no collision possible. But we need to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\ny=0 to 9, freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2, which is freeway 2, so at t=2, we need to check if there is collision at t=2 on y=2.\n\nAt t=2, freeway 2 has a car: (-42,-53,right,3), span at t=2: from -53 to -42, since it's right-moving.\n\n0 is between -53 and -42? -53 < 0 < -42? But -42 is greater than -53, so -53 to -42, which is from -53 to -42, so x from -53 to -42, 0 is greater than -42? -42 < 0, since -42 is negative, 0 > -42, so 0 is not in [-53, -42] because -42 < 0, so 0 is to the right of the car.\n\nx from -53 to -42, so min x = -53, max x = -42, so 0 > -42, so 0 is not in [min, max], so no collision at t=2 on y=2.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways, but at t=2, player is only on y=2, so for now safe.\n\nNow, we need to move to y=9.\n\nSince we can only change y by -1,0,+1 per turn, and y from 0 to 9, to go from 2 to 9, we need at least 7 moves up, but we can also move down or stay, but to minimize turns, we probably want to go up as much as possible, but we have to avoid collisions on the freeways.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 7, if we go up every turn, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nNow, the cars are moving, so we need to simulate for each freeway when x=0 is occupied.\n\nSince the collision depends on the turn and the y-position at that turn.\n\nLet Δt = T - t_1 = T - 2\n\nFor a car on freeway y, with (head, tail, dir, speed), at time T, the span is:\n\nSince all are right-moving, dir=right, so span at T is [tail + s*Δt, head + s*Δt] because for right-moving, span(T) = [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt]\n\nWhere τ is tail, h is head.\n\nFrom earlier: for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left, but no left here.\n\nNow, collision on freeway y at turn T if there exists a car on y such that 0 ∈ [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt]\n\nWhich means τ + sΔt <= 0 <= h + sΔt\n\nSince τ <= h, as head is front.\n\nIn all cases, for the cars, head > tail, so τ < h.\n\nSo 0 in [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] iff τ + sΔt <= 0 <= h + sΔt\n\nNow, for each freeway, we have multiple cars, so we need to check for any car on that freeway.\n\nAlso, since the player moves, at each turn, depending on y_t, we check if on that y_t, at turn t, there is collision.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and their parameters.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car: tail = -53, head = -42, s=3\n\nSo at time T, span: [ -53 + 3Δt, -42 + 3Δt ]\n\nCollision if -53 + 3Δt <= 0 <= -42 + 3Δt\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, tail=-53, head=-42, s=3, so same span as freeway 1 at all times.\n\nFreeway 2 has (-42,-53,right,3), same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: same, so freeways 1,2,3 all have identical cars: one car with tail=-53, head=-42, s=3.\n\nBut they are on different freeways, but for collision, we care per freeway.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars:\n\nCar1: tail=-51, head=-40, s=4  (since (head,tail) = (-40,-51), so tail=-51, head=-40)\n\nCar2: tail=-15, head=-4, s=4\n\nCar3: tail=13, head=32, s=4? (32,21,right,4), head=32, tail=21, so tail=21, head=32, s=4\n\nIn the table: (-40,-51,right,4), (-4,-15,right,4), (32,21,right,4)\n\nSo car1: tail=-51, head=-40, s=4\n\nCar2: tail=-15, head=-4, s=4\n\nCar3: tail=21, head=32, s=4\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (-24,-35,right,12) and (24,13,right,12)\n\nFirst car: tail=-35, head=-24, s=12\n\nSecond car: tail=13, head=24, s=12\n\nSimilarly, freeways 6,7,8 all have the same as freeway 5: one car with tail=-35, head=-24, s=12 and another with tail=13, head=24, s=12.\n\nFreeway 5 has (-24,-35,right,12) and (24,13,right,12), so tail=-35, head=-24 for first, tail=13, head=24 for second.\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we need to find when there is a collision at x=0, i.e., when for some car, 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nLet Δt = T - 2\n\nFor freeway 1 (and 2,3 same):\n\nCar: τ = -53, h = -42, s=3\n\n0 ∈ [ -53 + 3Δt, -42 + 3Δt ] iff\n\n-53 + 3Δt <= 0 <= -42 + 3Δt\n\nLeft: -53 + 3Δt <= 0 => 3Δt <= 53 => Δt <= 53/3 ≈ 17.666, so Δt <= 17 since integer\n\nRight: 0 <= -42 + 3Δt => 42 <= 3Δt => Δt >= 14\n\nSo collision when 14 <= Δt <= 17\n\nThat is, from T=2+14=16 to T=2+17=19\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3, same.\n\nNow freeway 4:\n\nThree cars.\n\nFirst car: τ=-51, h=-40, s=4\n\n0 ∈ [-51 + 4Δt, -40 + 4Δt] iff\n\n-51 + 4Δt <= 0 <= -40 + 4Δt\n\nLeft: -51 + 4Δt <= 0 => 4Δt <= 51 => Δt <= 51/4 = 12.75, Δt <= 12\n\nRight: 0 <= -40 + 4Δt => 40 <= 4Δt => Δt >= 10\n\nSo for first car, collision if 10 <= Δt <= 12\n\nSecond car: τ=-15, h=-4, s=4\n\n0 ∈ [-15 + 4Δt, -4 + 4Δt] iff\n\n-15 + 4Δt <= 0 <= -4 + 4Δt\n\nLeft: -15 + 4Δt <= 0 => 4Δt <= 15 => Δt <= 15/4 = 3.75, Δt <= 3\n\nRight: 0 <= -4 + 4Δt => 4 <= 4Δt => Δt >= 1\n\nSo collision if 1 <= Δt <= 3\n\nThird car: τ=21, h=32, s=4\n\n0 ∈ [21 + 4Δt, 32 + 4Δt]\n\nNow, 21 + 4Δt > 0 for all Δt >=0, since 21>0, and min is 21>0, so 0 < 21 + 4Δt <= 32 + 4Δt only if 0 >= 21 + 4Δt, which is impossible since 21+4Δt >=21>0. So 0 is never in this span because the span starts at 21+4Δt >0. So no collision from this car.\n\nTherefore, on freeway 4, collision if either first or second car causes it.\n\nFrom above: second car causes collision for Δt=1,2,3 (T=3,4,5)\n\nFirst car causes collision for Δt=10,11,12 (T=12,13,14)\n\nThird car never.\n\nSo overall, freeway 4 has collision at T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14\n\nΔt=1,2,3 → T=3,4,5\n\nΔt=10,11,12 → T=12,13,14\n\nNow freeway 5 (and similarly 6,7,8):\n\nFirst car: τ=-35, h=-24, s=12\n\n0 ∈ [-35 + 12Δt, -24 + 12Δt] iff\n\n-35 + 12Δt <= 0 <= -24 + 12Δt\n\nLeft: -35 + 12Δt <= 0 => 12Δt <= 35 => Δt <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so Δt <= 2\n\nRight: 0 <= -24 + 12Δt => 24 <= 12Δt => Δt >= 2\n\nSo collision if Δt >=2 and Δt <=2, so only when Δt=2, i.e., T=4\n\nSecond car: τ=13, h=24, s=12\n\n0 ∈ [13 + 12Δt, 24 + 12Δt]\n\n13 + 12Δt >0 for all Δt >=0, so 0 never in span, no collision.\n\nThus for freeway 5, collision only at T=4\n\nSimilarly for freeways 6,7,8, same as 5, collision only at T=4.\n\nNow, summarize the collision times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: collision at T=16,17,18,19 (since Δt=14 to 17, T=16 to 19)\n\n- Freeway 2: same as 1, T=16-19\n\n- Freeway 3: same, T=16-19\n\n- Freeway 4: collision at T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14\n\n- Freeway 5: collision at T=4\n\n- Freeway 6: collision at T=4\n\n- Freeway 7: collision at T=4\n\n- Freeway 8: collision at T=4\n\nFreeway 5 to 8 all have collision only at T=4.\n\nNow, player starts at t=2, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, with actions from t=2 onwards.\n\nLet me denote the turn sequence starting from t=2.\n\nAt turn t, player position y_t.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + a_t, with a_t = U, D, S.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9 for some H, but t_1=2, so at turn T=2+H-1, y=9.\n\nSince we start at t=2, after H-1 actions, we are at turn 2 + (H-1) = H+1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t=2, before any action, position is given.\n\nThen at turn t=2, we take action a_{t_1} = a_2, which determines y_{3} = y_2 + Δy_2.\n\nThen at turn t=3, take a_3, get y_4, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, we are at turn t=2+k, with position y_{2+k}.\n\nWe want y_{2+H-1} = 9? Let's set the turn.\n\nSet t as the turn number.\n\nStart: at turn t=2, y=2.\n\nAfter first action at t=2, we go to state at t=3, with y_3 = y_2 + a_2.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t, we take action a_t, and move to t+1 with new y.\n\nWe want for some turn T, y_T =9, and we want to minimize T - 2? The number of turns from start.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=2 to t=2+H-1, and at turn (2+H-1), we have y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn 2+H, with y_{2+H}.\n\nBut we want y_{2+H-1} =9? I think I have confusion.\n\nLet me read the action sequence.\n\nIt says: sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\n\nt_1=2, so a_{2 + t} for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nSo actions: a_2, a_{3}, ..., a_{2 + H -1}\n\nAfter taking a_{2 + H -1}, the position is updated to y_{2 + H}, and we want that to be 9? No.\n\nAt turn T, before action, position is y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, position becomes y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo at turn t=2, position y_2=2.\n\nAfter taking a_2, position becomes y_3.\n\nThen at turn t=3, position y_3, take a_3, go to y_4, and so on.\n\nAfter taking a_{2+H-1} at turn t=2+H-1, we go to y_{2+H}.\n\nWe want y_{2+H} =9.\n\nAnd we want the minimal H such that we can achieve this without collision during the path.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn t from 2 to 2+H-1, when we are at position (0, y_t), and if y_t between 1 and 8, we check if there is collision on that freeway at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, we are on y_t, and we take action, but collision is based on being on y_t at turn t.\n\nThen after action, we move to y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nFor the last turn, when we reach y=9, at that turn, say turn T, if T is when y_T=9, but y=9 has no freeway, so no collision, but we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSpecifically, we start at turn 2 with y=2.\n\nWe take actions a_2, a_3, ..., a_{K} for some K, and after a_K, we have y_{K+1} =9.\n\nAnd we want to minimize the number of actions, which is the number of turns from 2 to K, so H = K - 2 + 1? Let's define.\n\nThe sequence has H actions: from a_2 to a_{2+H-1}, so indices from 2 to 2+H-1, that's H actions.\n\nAfter these H actions, the position is y_{2+H}.\n\nWe want y_{2+H} =9.\n\nAnd during turns t=2 to t=2+H-1, we must not have collision, meaning at each turn t, when we are on y_t, if y_t in 1-8, no collision with cars on y_t at turn t.\n\nAt turn t=2+H, we are on y_{2+H}=9, which is safe, no check needed.\n\nNow, the minimal H: since we need to go from y=2 to y=9, difference 7, so with only U actions, H=7, y_{2+7} = y_9 = 2 + 7*1 =9, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid, so H >=7.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions at intermediate turns.\n\nNow, let's list the dangerous times for each y.\n\nSince freeways 1,2,3 are identical, and 5,6,7,8 identical except for the collision times.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3 all have collision at T=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 4 has collision at T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 have collision only at T=4\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at t=2.\n\ny=2 is freeway 2, which has collision only at t=16-19, but t=2 is early, so at t=2, no collision as we saw.\n\nWe need to go up to y=9.\n\nThe critical part is around t=4, where multiple freeways have collision.\n\nSpecifically, at t=4:\n\n- Freeway 4 has collision (from the second car)\n\n- Freeway 5,6,7,8 all have collision\n\n- Freeway 2 has no collision at t=4, since only at 16-19\n\nSimilarly, at t=3,5, etc.\n\nNow, since we start at y=2, we can move up, down, or stay.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go up as much as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when it has collision at that turn.\n\nFor example, at t=4, if we are on freeway 4,5,6,7, or 8, there is collision.\n\nFreeway 4 collision at t=4, and freeway 5-8 at t=4.\n\nSo at turn t=4, we must not be on y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, y=5 is freeway 5, etc.\n\nAlso, y=1,2,3 are freeways 1,2,3, which at t=4 have no collision, only later.\n\nAt t=4, freeway 1,2,3 are safe, freeway 4,5,6,7,8 have collision.\n\nSimilarly, at t=3: freeway 4 has collision (since t=3 is in 3,4,5 for freeway 4 second car), and freeway 5-8 have no collision except at t=4.\n\nAt t=3: freeway 4 collision? From above, freeway 4 collision at t=3,4,5.\n\nFreeway 5-8: collision only at t=4, so at t=3, no collision for them.\n\nSimilarly at t=5: freeway 4 collision at t=5, and freeway 5-8 no collision at t=5.\n\nNow, back to player.\n\nAt t=2, y=2, safe.\n\nWe take action a_2.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf we go up, to y=3 at t=3.\n\nIf down, to y=1 at t=3.\n\nIf stay, y=2 at t=3.\n\nNow at t=3, if we are on y=4, there is collision, but we start at y=2, so at t=3, after action from t=2.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nOption: go up immediately.\n\na_2 = U: then y_3 = 2 +1 =3\n\nAt t=3, y=3, which is freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3: at t=3, collision? From above, freeway 1,2,3 collision only at t=16-19, so at t=3, no collision. Safe.\n\nNow at t=3, take action, say a_3.\n\nIf we go up, a_3=U, then y_4=4\n\nAt t=4, y=4, which is freeway 4, and freeway 4 has collision at t=4, so collision! Not good.\n\nIf at t=3, we stay, a_3=S, then y_4=3\n\nAt t=4, y=3, freeway 3, which is safe at t=4.\n\nThen at t=4, we can take action.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nIf at t=3, we go down, a_3=D, then y_4=2, at t=4 y=2, freeway 2, safe.\n\nBut going down might not help.\n\nBack to t=3, y=3, safe.\n\nTo avoid collision at t=4 on y=4, we cannot be on y=4 at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y=5,6,7,8 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, the only safe y are y=1,2,3 (freeways 1,2,3).\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, but y=0 is bottom, y=9 top.\n\nNow at t=3, we are at y=3.\n\nIf we go up to y=4 at t=4, collision.\n\nIf we stay, y=4=3 at t=4, safe.\n\nIf we go down, to y=2 at t=4, safe.\n\nThen from there, we need to go up later.\n\nBut we have to deal with other dangerous times.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can reach y=9 before the later collisions, like at t=12-14 and 16-19.\n\nt=12-14 for freeway 4, and t=16-19 for freeway 1,2,3.\n\nSince we start at t=2, if we go directly up, we can reach y=9 by t=9 or so.\n\nFor example, if no obstacles, from y=2 at t=2, after 7 ups, at t=2+7=9, y=9.\n\nNow, at t=9, what happens? Freeway 4 has collision at t=12,13,14, not at t=9, so should be fine.\n\nBut at t=4, we have problem if we go straight.\n\nIn the direct path: t=2, y=2\n\na_2=U, t=3, y=3\n\na_3=U, t=4, y=4 → collision at t=4 on freeway 4.\n\nSo we need to avoid that.\n\nWe need to not be on y=4 at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, not on y=5,6,7,8 at t=4.\n\nSo at t=4, we must be on y=0,1,2,3 or 9.\n\nBut y=9 is far, not possible yet.\n\ny=0 possible.\n\nNow, at t=3, we are at y=3 (if we went up first).\n\nTo not be on y=4 at t=4, we can:\n\n- Stay at y=3: a_3=S, then at t=4, y=3, safe.\n\n- Or go down to y=2: a_3=D, then t=4, y=2, safe.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nBut after t=4, the danger is passed for t=4.\n\nThere is another danger at t=12-14 for freeway 4, but if we reach y=9 before, we might avoid.\n\nSimilarly for later.\n\nFirst, let's handle the immediate t=4 issue.\n\nSo suppose at t=3, y=3, we stay: a_3=S, then at t=4, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=4, we can go up: a_4=U, then y_5=4\n\nNow at t=5, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nAt t=5, freeway 4 has collision? Yes, from earlier, freeway 4 collision at t=3,4,5, so t=5 also collision! Oh, problem.\n\nAt t=5, y=4, collision.\n\nIf at t=4, we go up to y=4 at t=5, but at t=5, freeway 4 has collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down or stay at t=4, but we need to go up.\n\nLet's list the safe actions.\n\nFrom t=3, y=3.\n\nIf a_3=U, then y_4=4, at t=4 collision.\n\nIf a_3=S, y_4=3, at t=4 safe.\n\nThen at t=4, y=3, take a_4.\n\nIf a_4=U, y_5=4, at t=5 y=4, freeway 4 collision at t=5.\n\nIf a_4=S, y_5=3, then we are stuck, need to move eventually.\n\nIf a_4=D, y_5=2, then go down.\n\nBut that might not help.\n\nAt t=5, freeway 4 has collision, so we cannot be on y=4 at t=5.\n\nSimilarly, at t=3,4,5, freeway 4 has collision, so we cannot be on y=4 at turns t=3,4,5.\n\nt=3,4,5 are all dangerous for y=4.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but at t=3, only freeway 4 has collision, at t=4, freeway 4 and 5-8 have collision, at t=5, freeway 4 has collision.\n\nNow, player at t=2, y=2.\n\nWe need to be not on y=4 at t=3,4,5.\n\nBut at t=3, if we are on y=4, it would be from action at t=2, but at t=2 we are at y=2, so to be at y=4 at t=3, we need to go up twice in a row, but from y=2 at t=2, if a_2=U, y_3=3, not 4. To be at y=4 at t=3, we need y_3=4, which requires from y_2=2, a_2=U and something, but y_3 depends only on a_2, y_3 = y_2 + a_2, so from y_2=2, y_3 can be 1,2,3, not 4. So at t=3, possible y=1,2,3 only.\n\nSimilarly, at t=4, y can be from 0 to 4, depending on actions.\n\nBut we cannot be on y=4 at t=4 or t=5.\n\nAt t=4, y=4 would be bad, at t=5 y=4 bad.\n\nNow, let's find a path.\n\nStart t=2, y=2.\n\nTake a_2.\n\nOption 1: a_2 = U, then y_3=3\n\nAt t=3, y=3, safe (freeway 3 safe at t=3)\n\nNow at t=3, we need to choose a_3.\n\nIf a_3 = U, y_4=4, but at t=4, y=4 collision, bad.\n\nIf a_3 = S, y_4=3, at t=4 y=3 safe.\n\nThen at t=4, y=3, take a_4.\n\nIf a_4 = U, y_5=4, at t=5 y=4 collision, bad.\n\nIf a_4 = S, y_5=3, then we are at y=3, need to go up later.\n\nIf a_4 = D, y_5=2, go down.\n\nBut then at t=5, y=2 or 3, safe, but we lost progress.\n\nAfter t=5, freeway 4 is safe until t=12, so we can go up.\n\nFor example, at t=4, y=3, if we stay, a_4=S, y_5=3\n\nAt t=5, y=3, safe, and freeway 4 no collision after t=5 until t=12.\n\nAt t=5, freeway 4 has collision only up to t=5? t=5 is included, but at t=5, if we are on y=4, collision, but we are at y=3, so safe.\n\nThen at t=5, we can go up: a_5=U, y_6=4\n\nAt t=6, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nNow at t=6, is there collision on freeway 4? From earlier, freeway 4 collision at t=3,4,5 and t=12,13,14. t=6 is not in, so no collision. Safe.\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5-8 have collision only at t=4, so at t=6, no issue.\n\nSo let's see the sequence:\n\nt=2: y=2, take a_2=U, go to y_3=3\n\nt=3: y=3, take a_3=S, stay, y_4=3\n\nt=4: y=3, take a_4=S, stay, y_5=3  (but we could go up? but at t=5 if we go to y=4, but t=5 collision on y=4)\n\nAt t=4, if we go up, a_4=U, y_5=4, at t=5 collision.\n\nSo we must not go up at t=4 if we want to avoid t=5 collision on y=4.\n\nThus, at t=4, y=3, we should stay or go down, but going down not necessary.\n\nSo a_4=S, y_5=3\n\nt=5: y=3, now safe, take a_5=U, y_6=4\n\nt=6: y=4, no collision (since t=6 not dangerous for freeway 4), so safe.\n\nThen we can go up: a_6=U, y_7=5\n\nt=7: y=5, freeway 5, at t=7, freeway 5 collision? Only at t=4, so no, safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_7=U, y_8=6\n\nt=8: y=6, freeway 6, no collision except t=4, safe.\n\na_8=U, y_9=7\n\nt=9: y=7, freeway 7, safe.\n\na_9=U, y_10=8\n\nt=10: y=8, freeway 8, safe.\n\na_10=U, y_11=9\n\nt=11: y=9, reached, safe.\n\nNow, actions: from t=2 to t=10, we have actions a_2 to a_10, that's 9 actions? Let's list:\n\nActions taken: at t=2: U\n\nt=3: S\n\nt=4: S\n\nt=5: U\n\nt=6: U\n\nt=7: U\n\nt=8: U\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U\n\nAfter a_10, y_11=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=2 to t=10, that's 9 actions: a_2 to a_10.\n\nH-1 = ? The sequence has H actions, from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, t_1=2, so a_2 to a_{2+H-1}\n\nAfter H actions, y_{2+H} = position.\n\nIn this case, after a_10, y_11=9, so 2 + H =11, so H=9.\n\nBut minimal H? We used some stay actions, so H=9 >7.\n\nCan we do with less?\n\nWe need to reach y=9 faster.\n\nAnother idea: at t=2, instead of going up, go down to y=1.\n\nBut y=1 might be safe or not.\n\nAt t=2, y=2, take a_2=D, then y_3=1\n\nAt t=3, y=1, freeway 1.\n\nAt t=3, freeway 1: collision only at t=16-19, so safe.\n\nThen at t=3, we can stay or go up.\n\nBut at t=4, we need to avoid y=4 to 8.\n\nIf we go up from y=1 at t=3.\n\na_3=U, then y_4=2\n\nAt t=4, y=2, freeway 2, safe.\n\nThen at t=4, we can go up, a_4=U, y_5=3\n\nAt t=5, y=3, safe.\n\nThen a_5=U, y_6=4\n\nAt t=6, y=4, freeway 4, no collision at t=6, safe.\n\nThen same as before, go up to y=9.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=2: y=2, a_2=D, y_3=1\n\nt=3: y=1, a_3=U, y_4=2\n\nt=4: y=2, a_4=U, y_5=3\n\nt=5: y=3, a_5=U, y_6=4\n\nt=6: y=4, a_6=U, y_7=5\n\n...\n\nup to y=9.\n\nFrom y=6 at t=6, go U to y=7 at t=7, etc.\n\ny_6=4 at t=6, a_6=U, y_7=5 at t=7\n\na_7=U, y_8=6 at t=8\n\na_8=U, y_9=7 at t=9\n\na_9=U, y_10=8 at t=10\n\na_10=U, y_11=9 at t=11\n\nSame as before, H=10 actions? Actions from t=2 to t=10, 9 actions, y_11=9.\n\nt=2 to t=10 inclusive? Actions: a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9, a_10 → 9 actions, after which y_11=9.\n\nBut we started at t=2, after 9 actions, at turn 11.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn T, with T=11.\n\nMinimal possible is turn 9 with 7 ups.\n\nBut we have delays.\n\nIn the first sequence, we had two stays, but in this one, we have a down and then up, but same number of actions.\n\nIn the first sequence: U, S, S, U, U, U, U, U, U → from t=2 to t=10 actions, 9 actions.\n\nBut the actions: a_2=U, a_3=S, a_4=S, a_5=U, a_6=U, a_7=U, a_8=U, a_9=U, a_10=U\n\nAfter a_10, y_11=9.\n\nThe last action is at t=10, position after is y_11=9.\n\nNumber of actions H=9.\n\nIn the down-up sequence: a_2=D, a_3=U, a_4=U, a_5=U, a_6=U, a_7=U, a_8=U, a_9=U, a_10=U → same 9 actions, but we reached y=9 at t=11 still.\n\na_2=D to y_3=1, then a_3=U to y_4=2, a_4=U to y_5=3, a_5=U to y_6=4, a_6=U to y_7=5, a_7=U to y_8=6, a_8=U to y_9=7, a_9=U to y_10=8, a_10=U to y_11=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut at t=5, y=3, we go to y=4 at t=6, which is fine.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=3 at t=4, and then at t=4 go up, but at t=5 we have collision on y=4.\n\nUnless we can skip y=4 or something.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=0 or up to y=9 directly, but not possible.\n\nPerhaps at t=4, be on y=0 or y=1 or y=2.\n\nFor example, start at t=2 y=2.\n\na_2 = D, to y_3=1\n\nThen at t=3, y=1, a_3 = D, to y_4=0\n\nAt t=4, y=0, which is safe, no freeway.\n\nThen at t=4, y=0, we can go up, a_4=U, to y_5=1\n\nAt t=5, y=1, freeway 1, safe.\n\nThen a_5=U, to y_6=2, and so on.\n\nBut we go down to y=0 and up, which takes more turns.\n\nFor example, a_2=D, y_3=1\n\na_3=D, y_4=0\n\na_4=U, y_5=1\n\na_5=U, y_6=2\n\na_6=U, y_7=3\n\na_7=U, y_8=4\n\nAt t=8, y=4, freeway 4, now at t=8, is there collision? Freeway 4 collision at t=12,13,14, not t=8, so safe.\n\nThen continue: a_8=U, y_9=5\n\na_9=U, y_10=6\n\na_10=U, y_11=7\n\na_11=U, y_12=8\n\na_12=U, y_13=9\n\nNow at t=13, y=13? y_13=9.\n\nBut at t=12, when going to y=8? Let's see.\n\nAt t=12, if we are on y=8, but freeway 8 has collision only at t=4, so safe.\n\nBut at t=12, freeway 4 has collision? Yes, at t=12,13,14.\n\nIn this path, at t=12, where are we?\n\nFrom above: at t=8, y=4 (after a_7=U from y_7=3? t=7 y=3, a_7=U, y_8=4 at t=8\n\nt=8: y=4\n\na_8=U, y_9=5 at t=9\n\na_9=U, y_10=6 at t=10\n\na_10=U, y_11=7 at t=11\n\na_11=U, y_12=8 at t=12\n\nAt t=12, y=8, freeway 8, but freeway 8 collision only at t=4, so no collision at t=12.\n\nBut freeway 4 is y=4, not here.\n\nThen a_12=U, y_13=9 at t=13.\n\nReached at t=13 with more actions.\n\nWorse than previous.\n\nBack to first sequence with H=9.\n\nBut in the first sequence, we reached at t=11 with 9 actions.\n\nCan we do with H=8?\n\nThat is, reach y=9 at turn 10.\n\ny_{10} =9.\n\nStart at t=2 y=2.\n\nAfter 8 actions, y_{10} = y_2 + sum of Δy from t=2 to t=9 actions? Actions a_2 to a_{2+7} for H=8? Let's see.\n\nH actions: a_2 to a_{2+H-1}\n\nAfter H actions, y_{2+H} =9\n\nFor H=8, y_{10} =9\n\ny_{10} =9, so at turn 10, position is 9.\n\nNow, from y_2=2, to y_{10}=9, net change +7, so we need exactly 7 U and one S, or 6 U and 2 S, etc., but since we need +7, the number of U must be at least 7, and D must be 0, because D would decrease, so to have net +7 in 8 actions, we must have 7 U and 1 S, or 8 U but y max 9, from 2 to 9 is +7, so with 8 actions, we can have 7 U and 1 S, or 8 U but y=10 invalid, so must be 7 U and 1 S.\n\nThe S can be at some point.\n\nNow, we need to avoid being on dangerous y at dangerous t.\n\nDangerous times: at t=4, must not be on y=4,5,6,7,8\n\nAt t=3, must not be on y=4, but y=4 not reachable at t=3, as earlier.\n\nAt t=3, y can be 1,2,3.\n\nAt t=5, must not be on y=4.\n\nAlso later t=12-14 for y=4, but if we reach early, not issue.\n\nSimilarly t=16-19 for y=1,2,3.\n\nSince we reach by t=10, t=10 <12, so no later issues.\n\nNow, for H=8, we reach y_{10}=9.\n\nActions from t=2 to t=9: a_2 to a_9, 8 actions.\n\ny_{10} = y_2 + sum_{k=2}^9 Δy_k = 2 + sum of 8 actions.\n\nSince y_{10}=9, sum of Δy = +7.\n\nSo exactly 7 U and 1 S.\n\nNow, the positions:\n\nAt t=2, y=2\n\nAfter a_2, y_3 = 2 + a_2\n\nSimilarly.\n\nWe need to ensure that at each turn t from 2 to 9, when on y_t, no collision.\n\ny_t for t=2 to 9.\n\nAt t=10, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, critical points: at t=4, must not be on y=4,5,6,7,8. Since y<=8 probably, but y=8 possible.\n\nSimilarly at t=5, must not be on y=4.\n\nAlso, at t=3, no issue since y<=3.\n\nt=2: y=2, safe as before.\n\nNow, let's assume we go up most of the time.\n\nSuppose we have one stay.\n\nThe stay can be at some turn.\n\nIf we stay at t=3, for example.\n\nAt t=2, a_2=U, y_3=3\n\nThen at t=3, if a_3=S, y_4=3\n\nAt t=4, y=3, which is safe (y=3 not dangerous at t=4)\n\nThen at t=4, we need to go up, but if a_4=U, y_5=4, then at t=5, y=4, collision! Because t=5 freeway 4 collision.\n\nBut we have to go up at some point.\n\nIf at t=4, we go up, we get collision at t=5.\n\nIf we don't go up at t=4, but later, but we have only one stay, so we need to use the stay to delay.\n\nSuppose at t=2, we do not go up immediately.\n\na_2=S, then y_3=2\n\nAt t=3, y=2, safe.\n\nThen a_3=U, y_4=3\n\nAt t=4, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=4, a_4=U, y_5=4, at t=5 y=4 collision.\n\nSame issue.\n\na_2=U, y_3=3\n\na_3=U, but y_4=4, at t=4 collision immediately.\n\nWorse.\n\nPerhaps go down first.\n\na_2=D, y_3=1\n\na_3=U, y_4=2\n\nAt t=4, y=2, safe.\n\nThen a_4=U, y_5=3\n\nAt t=5, y=3, safe.\n\nNow at t=5, we can go up, a_5=U, y_6=4\n\nAt t=6, y=4, safe as before.\n\nThen from here, we need to go to y=9 by t=10.\n\ny_6=4, to y_{10}=9, need +5 in 4 actions (from a_5 to a_9? Actions left: at t=5,6,7,8,9 for a_5 to a_9.\n\nAfter y_5=3 at t=5, we take a_5, then y_6, up to a_9 for y_{10}.\n\na_5 at t=5 determines y_6, a_6 at t=6 y_7, ..., a_9 at t=9 y_{10}.\n\nSo from y_5 to y_{10}, 5 steps? y_5 to y_6, y_7, y_8, y_9, y_{10}, that's 5 intervals, 5 actions.\n\ny_5=3, y_{10}=9, need +6, so we need 6 up actions, but only 5 actions? Contradiction.\n\ny_5 at t=5, after a_5, y_6 at t=6, ..., after a_9, y_{10} at t=10.\n\nSo from y_5 to y_{10}, there are 5 actions: a_5,a_6,a_7,a_8,a_9, each can change y by +1,-1,0.\n\ny_5=3, y_{10}=9, so net +6, but with 5 actions, impossible since max increase 5 with 5 ups.\n\nMinimal increase is with all U, +5, to y=8, not 9.\n\ny_5=3, after 5 ups: y_6=4, y_7=5, y_8=6, y_9=7, y_{10}=8, which is less than 9.\n\nTo reach y_{10}=9, we need y_5 + sum Δy =9, with 5 actions, sum Δy <=5, so y_5 must be at least 4.\n\nBut in this case, at t=5, we have y_5=3, so impossible to reach y_{10}=9 with only 5 actions from there.\n\nTherefore, with this path, we cannot reach by t=10; we need more actions.\n\nIn the earlier path with S at t=3 and t=4, we had y_5=3, then to y_{11}=9 with 6 actions: a_5 to a_10, 6 actions for +6, to y=9.\n\nBut for H=8, we need to reach at t=10.\n\nSo we need to be higher earlier.\n\nFor example, if at t=4, we are at y=3 or more.\n\nBut at t=4, we must be on y<=3 to be safe.\n\nSuppose at t=4, we are at y=3.\n\nThen y_4=3.\n\nThen from there to y_{10}=9, need +6 in 6 actions: a_4 to a_9 for y_5 to y_{10}.\n\ny_4 at t=4, after a_4, y_5, ..., after a_9, y_{10}.\n\nSo actions a_4 to a_9, 6 actions, y_{10} = y_4 + sum_{k=4}^9 Δy_k\n\ny_4=3, y_{10}=9, so sum Δy = +6, so 6 U and 0 S/D, possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid collision at t=5 on y=4.\n\nIf we go up from y_4=3 at t=4, a_4=U, then y_5=4, at t=5 y=4 collision.\n\nIf we stay at t=4, a_4=S, y_5=3, then at t=5 y=3 safe, but then we need to go to y=9 with 5 actions from y_5=3, which requires +6, impossible as before.\n\ny_5=3, to y_{10}=9 with 5 actions, max y_{10}=8.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 by turn 10 with H=8 actions starting from t=2.\n\nBecause to go from y=2 to y=9 in 8 actions, we need exactly 7 U and 1 S, so we must have one stay.\n\nBut wherever we place the stay, we will be forced to be on y=4 at t=4 or t=5, causing collision.\n\nFor example, if we stay at t=2: a_2=S, y_3=2\n\nThen at t=3, y=2, a_3=U, y_4=3\n\nThen at t=4, y=3, now if a_4=U, y_5=4 at t=5 collision.\n\nIf a_4=S, y_5=3, then we need to reach y=9 from y_5=3 with 5 actions, impossible.\n\nIf we stay later, say at t=3: a_2=U, y_3=3, a_3=S, y_4=3\n\nThen same as above, at t=4 y=3, if a_4=U, y_5=4 collision; if S, y_5=3, then from y_5=3 to y_{10}=9 with 5 actions impossible.\n\nIf we stay at t=4: a_2=U, y_3=3, a_3=U, but a_3=U, y_4=4, at t=4 collision immediately.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf we go down and up, but that adds downs, which require more ups, so net slower.\n\nFor example, a_2=D, y_3=1, then to reach y_{10}=9, we need +8 from y_3, with 7 actions (a_3 to a_9), which requires 8 U but only 7 actions, impossible since max +7 to y=8.\n\ny_3=1, y_{10}=9, need +8 with 7 actions, max +7, so y_{10}=8<9, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, any down action makes it worse.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 9, reaching at turn 11.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we also have later dangers, but since we reach before t=12, it should be fine.\n\nIn the first sequence: actions U at t=2, S at t=3, S at t=4, then U from t=5 to t=10.\n\nt=5 to t=10 is 6 actions: U,U,U,U,U,U to go from y=3 to y=9? y_5=3, after a_5=U, y_6=4, ..., after a_10=U, y_11=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut at t=12,13,14 freeway 4 has collision, but we are not on it, and at t=16-19 freeway 1,2,3, but we are at y=9.\n\nNow, to confirm, in the sequence, at each turn:\n\nt=2: y=2, freeway 2, no collision (t=2 <16)\n\nt=3: y=3, freeway 3, no collision\n\nt=4: y=3, freeway 3, no collision\n\nt=5: y=3, freeway 3, no collision\n\nt=6: y=4, freeway 4, no collision (t=6 not 3,4,5 or 12,13,14)\n\nt=7: y=5, freeway 5, no collision (only t=4)\n\nt=8: y=6, freeway 6, no collision\n\nt=9: y=7, freeway 7, no collision\n\nt=10: y=8, freeway 8, no collision\n\nt=11: y=9, safe\n\nActions: a_2=U, a_3=S, a_4=S, a_5=U, a_6=U, a_7=U, a_8=U, a_9=U, a_10=U\n\nH=9 actions.\n\nBut the last action is a_10, at turn t=10, which sets y_11=9.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list the actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nt_1=2, H=9, so actions a_2 to a_{2+8}=a_10.\n\na_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to 8, a_{2+0}=a_2 to a_{2+8}=a_10.\n\nYes.\n\nWe can write the sequence.\n\nBut is there a way with H=8? We thought not.\n\nPerhaps by going faster at some point.\n\nAnother idea: at t=2, go U to y=3\n\nt=3, instead of stay, go U, but then at t=4 y=4 collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nOr, since at t=4, freeway 5-8 have collision, but we are not there yet.\n\nBut we have to avoid y=4 at t=4 and t=5.\n\nBut with the constraints, we need to lose at least two turns: one to avoid going to y=4 too early, and one because we cannot be at y=4 at t=5 if we go up.\n\nIn the sequence, we have two S or equivalent, but in the first sequence, we have two S, but one is at t=3 and one at t=4, but we could have different.\n\nIn the down-up, we had one D and one U, which is like two actions for no net change.\n\nBut same H.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=5, we have a_5=U, to y=4 at t=6.\n\nBut freeway 4 has collision at t=12,13,14, which is later, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, no other issues.\n\nSo the action sequence should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = a_2 = U\n\nBut t_1=2, so Turn 2: U\n\nThen Turn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAnd that's 9 actions.\n\nAfter Turn 10 action, position is y_11=9.\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states at critical points.\n\nFor example, at t=6, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nCars on freeway 4: at t=6, Δt=4 (since t_1=2, T=6, Δt=4)\n\nCar1: τ=-51, h=-40, s=4, span at T=6: [ -51 + 4*4, -40 + 4*4] = [ -51+16, -40+16] = [-35, -24], 0 not in.\n\nCar2: τ=-15, h=-4, s=4, [ -15+16, -4+16] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12] since 0<1.\n\nCar3: τ=21, h=32, [21+16,32+16]=[37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nAt t=4, we were on y=3, freeway 3, which has car at t=4: Δt=2, τ=-53, h=-42, s=3, span [ -53+6, -42+6] = [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the answer format, it should be for each turn.\n\nSince t_1=2, and actions from t=2 to t=10.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the sequence of actions must be carefully planned to avoid dangerous times when cars occupy \\(x = 0\\) on specific freeways.\n\n### Dangerous Times for Collisions:\n- **Freeways 1, 2, 3**: Collision at turns \\(T = 16, 17, 18, 19\\).\n- **Freeway 4**: Collision at turns \\(T = 3, 4, 5\\) and \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\).\n- **Freeways 5, 6, 7, 8**: Collision only at turn \\(T = 4\\).\n\nThe player starts at turn 2 on \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2), which is safe at this turn. To minimize the number of turns \\(H\\), the player should aim to reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible but must avoid:\n- Being on \\(y = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\) at turn \\(T = 4\\) (due to collisions on freeways 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).\n- Being on \\(y = 4\\) at turns \\(T = 3, 4, 5\\) (due to collisions on freeway 4).\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 9, achieved with the following action sequence:\n- At turn 2, move up to \\(y = 3\\).\n- At turn 3, stay to remain at \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as freeway 3 has no collision at \\(T = 3\\)).\n- At turn 4, stay to remain at \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as freeway 3 has no collision at \\(T = 4\\), and avoids dangerous freeways).\n- From turn 5 to turn 10, move up consecutively to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11, avoiding all collisions since:\n  - Freeway 4 is safe at \\(T \\geq 6\\) (no collision until \\(T = 12\\)).\n  - Freeways 5-8 are safe for \\(T \\neq 4\\).\n  - The later dangerous times (\\(T = 12-14\\) and \\(T = 16-19\\)) are avoided as \\(y = 9\\) is reached by turn 11.\n\nThis sequence uses 9 actions (from turn 2 to turn 10), with \\(y_{11} = 9\\).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\\) for \\(t_1 = 2\\) and \\(H = 9\\) are:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 4, but since we're starting at turn t_1, I'll just think of this as time t=0 for simplicity, so the player starts at y=3.\n\nThe actions are U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), or S (stay, y same). y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to 8. For each freeway, there are cars with positions given at turn t_1=4. The positions are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For left-moving cars, head is the front, and for right-moving, head is also the front, but the span is defined differently.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t) = [h, τ] and at time T, it becomes [h - s(T-t), τ - s(T-t)]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t) = [τ, h] and becomes [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)]\n\nIn the input, for right-moving cars, it's given as (head h, tail τ, right, speed), but in the span definition for right-moving, it says Span(t) = [τ, h], which might be confusing.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\nFor car k on freeway i, at turn t_1, head at h, tail at τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nThen for left-moving (I assume d=left), Span(t_1) = [h, τ]? But in the update it says for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] where ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nBut in the car state, it's given as (h, τ, d, s). For example, freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3)\n\nSince direction is right, Span(t_1) should be [τ, h] = [-47, -36], because τ is tail, h is head.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nThen at time T, for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T at that turn, and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant point: when you move, at turn T, you are on y_T. If you move to a different y at turn T+1, you are not on that y at turn T, so you don't collide if cars are there at T but not at T+1, etc.\n\nSpecifically: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut since you're moving at turn T to y_{T+1}, at turn T you are on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nThe collision check is at the beginning of the turn, I think, when you are on y_T for that turn.\n\nFrom the note: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd the note clarifies that if you move to a different row at turn T, you are not on that row at turn T, so no collision from cars on that row at T.\n\nFor example, if at turn T, you are on row y, and you move to row y' at turn T+1, then at turn T, you are on row y, so you can collide with cars on row y at turn T if 0 in their span. At turn T+1, you are on row y', so you can collide with cars on row y' at turn T+1 if 0 in span.\n\nCars on other rows don't matter.\n\nAlso, the player is always at x=0, so we care if 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nGoal: minimize H, the number of turns, to reach y=9.\n\nStart at y=3, time t=4 (but we'll use relative time).\n\nSet t=0 as current turn, so start at y=0 = 3 (relative time).\n\nWe need to find actions for t=0 to t=H-1, and at t=H-1, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=0 to t=H-1, that's H actions, and after H actions, at time t=H, we have y_H, but the position is after the action.\n\nDefine: at turn t, before action, position is y_t. After action a_t, position y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t, the player is at (0, y_t).\n\nCollision at turn t if 0 in span of any car on freeway y_t at time t.\n\nWe start at t=0 (which is t_1=4), y_0 = 3.\n\nAfter action a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0, and so on.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn H, y_H should be 9.\n\nTurn indices: from t=0 to t=H, we have positions y_0 to y_H.\n\nBut actions are from t=0 to t=H-1.\n\nAt turn t, for t from 0 to H-1, we perform action a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nThen at turn t, player is at y_t.\n\nAt turn H, player is at y_H, and we want y_H = 9.\n\nBut since we start at t=0, y_0=3, and after H actions, y_H=9.\n\nNow, the minimal H.\n\nFirst, since we need to go from y=3 to y=9, the minimum possible H is 6, if we go up every turn. But there might be cars blocking, so we might need to wait or go down sometimes, but going down might not help since we need to go up.\n\ny from 3 to 9, difference 6, so minimum 6 turns if no obstacles.\n\nBut with cars, it might take more.\n\nWe need to check for each freeway and each turn if being on that freeway is safe, i.e., no car has 0 in its span.\n\nSince the player is only at x=0, we only care if 0 is covered by a car on that row at that time.\n\nNow, for each freeway k, and for each car on it, we can compute for which times t (relative to t_1=4) the car covers x=0.\n\nt_1=4, so relative time τ = t - t_1, but since t_1 is fixed, we can think of time from turn 4 onwards.\n\nSet T as absolute turn, so T = t_1 + t for t>=0.\n\nBut t_1=4, so T=4,5,6,...\n\nFor simplicity, let's use relative time t, where t=0 corresponds to T=4.\n\nSo at time t (relative), the absolute turn is T = 4 + t.\n\nNow for a car on freeway k, with given (h, τ, d, s) at time t=0 (T=4).\n\nFirst, for direction.\n\nIf direction is right, then at time t=0, span is [τ, h] for right-moving? Let's clarify the notation.\n\nFrom the car state:\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3)\n\nSince direction right, and Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-47, -36] at t=0.\n\nThen at relative time t (so ΔT = t), span is [τ + s*t, h + s*t] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, span [h - s*t, τ - s*t], but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving, from the list.\n\nLet's list all cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-36, -47, right, 3)\n\nSo at time t, span: [ -47 + 3t, -36 + 3t ]\n\nFreeway 2: same, (-36, -47, right, 3) so span [ -47 + 3t, -36 + 3t ]\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-36, -47, right, 3) span [ -47 + 3t, -36 + 3t ]\n\nFreeway 4: three cars:\n\nFirst: (-32, -43, right, 4) span at t: [ -43 + 4t, -32 + 4t ]\n\nSecond: (4, -7, right, 4)? Head h=4, tail τ=-7? That seems odd, because for right-moving, tail should be left of head, but here τ=-7, h=4, so if right-moving, tail is at -7, head at 4, so span [τ, h] = [-7, 4] at t=0.\n\nSimilarly, third: (40, 29, right, 4) h=40, τ=29, so span [29,40] at t=0? But 29 to 40, that's fine.\n\nτ=29, h=40, so if right-moving, head is at higher x, so span [τ, h] = [29,40] at t=0.\n\nBut x=0 is not near there, so might not matter.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: two cars\n\nFirst: (0, -11, right, 12) so h=0, τ=-11, direction right, so span at t=0: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nSecond: (48, 37, right, 12) span [37,48]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5: (0, -11, right, 12) and (48,37,right,12) so spans [-11,0] and [37,48] at t=0\n\nFreeway 7: same, (0,-11,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: same, (0,-11,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 4 has three cars, but let's list all.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we need to find when x=0 is covered, i.e., when 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway.\n\nFor freeway k, at time t, if there is a car such that 0 ∈ [low, high] of its span at time t.\n\nSince multiple cars, but we only care if any covers x=0.\n\nNow, for freeway 1: car span at t: [ -47 + 3t, -36 + 3t ]\n\n0 in this interval if -47 + 3t <= 0 <= -36 + 3t\n\nSo -47 + 3t <= 0 and 0 <= -36 + 3t\n\nFirst inequality: 3t <= 47, t <= 47/3 ≈ 15.666, so t <= 15\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 + 3t, so 3t >= 36, t >= 12\n\nSo t from 12 to 15 inclusive? t integer, since turns.\n\nt >=12 and t <=15\n\nt=12,13,14,15\n\nAt t=12: low = -47 + 36 = -11, high = -36 + 36 = 0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included.\n\nAt t=13: low = -47+39= -8, high= -36+39=3, [ -8,3], 0 in.\n\nt=14: low=-47+42=-5, high=-36+42=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nt=15: low=-47+45=-2, high=-36+45=9, [-2,9], 0 in.\n\nt=16: low=-47+48=1, high=-36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 1 blocked at t=12,13,14,15\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 and 3 are identical, same car, so also blocked at t=12,13,14,15\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-32,-43,right,4) span at t: [ -43 +4t, -32 +4t ]\n\n0 in this if -43+4t <=0 <= -32+4t\n\nSo -43+4t <=0 => 4t <=43 => t <= 10.75, t<=10\n\n0 <= -32+4t => 4t >=32 => t>=8\n\nSo t from 8 to 10 inclusive.\n\nt=8: low=-43+32= -11, high=-32+32=0, [-11,0], 0 in\n\nt=9: low=-43+36= -7, high=-32+36=4, [-7,4], 0 in\n\nt=10: low=-43+40= -3, high=-32+40=8, [-3,8], 0 in\n\nt=11: low=-43+44=1, high=-32+44=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSecond car on freeway 4: (4, -7, right, 4) head h=4, tail τ=-7, so span at t=0: [τ, h] = [-7,4]\n\nAt time t: [ -7 +4t, 4 +4t ]\n\n0 in this if -7+4t <=0 <=4+4t\n\nFirst: -7+4t <=0 => 4t <=7 => t <= 1.75, t<=1\n\nSecond: 0 <=4+4t, always true for t>=0\n\nSo t<=1 and t>=0, so t=0 and t=1\n\nt=0: [ -7,4], 0 in\n\nt=1: [ -7+4, 4+4] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nt=2: [ -7+8, 4+8] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nThird car: (40,29,right,4) span at t: [29+4t, 40+4t], which for t>=0, min is at t=0 [29,40], 0 not in, and increasing, so never covers 0.\n\nSo for freeway 4, covered when:\n\n- First car: t=8,9,10\n\n- Second car: t=0,1\n\n- Third car: never\n\nSo overall, freeway 4 blocked at t=0,1,8,9,10\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars\n\nFirst: (0, -11, right, 12) so h=0, τ=-11, span at t=0: [τ, h] = [-11,0]\n\nAt time t: [ -11 +12t, 0 +12t ] = [ -11+12t, 12t ]\n\n0 in this if -11+12t <=0 <=12t\n\nFirst: -11+12t <=0 => 12t <=11 => t <= 11/12 ≈0.916, so t<=0 (since t integer, t=0)\n\nSecond: 0 <=12t, always for t>=0\n\nSo only t=0: [ -11,0], 0 in\n\nt=1: [ -11+12, 0+12] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,12) span [37+12t, 48+12t], never covers 0.\n\nSo freeway 5 blocked only at t=0\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5, blocked only at t=0\n\nFreeway 7: same, blocked only at t=0\n\nFreeway 8: same, blocked only at t=0\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 all have the same cars: one car at [-11,0] at t=0 and another not covering, so all blocked only at t=0.\n\nNow, summary for each freeway, times when blocked (x=0 covered):\n\ny=1: blocked t=12,13,14,15\n\ny=2: same, t=12,13,14,15\n\ny=3: same as y=1 and 2, t=12,13,14,15\n\ny=4: blocked at t=0,1,8,9,10\n\ny=5: blocked at t=0\n\ny=6: blocked at t=0\n\ny=7: blocked at t=0\n\ny=8: blocked at t=0\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, no cars, always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=3 at t=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nAt each turn t, if we are on a freeway row y from 1 to 8, we must not be blocked at that time.\n\nNow, the player can move up, down, or stay.\n\nWe need a sequence of actions from t=0 to t=H-1 such that y_H = 9, and for each t from 0 to H-1, at position y_t, it is safe at time t.\n\ny_t is the position at turn t, before action a_t.\n\nAfter a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t must be safe, meaning if y_t is between 1 and 8, it must not be blocked at time t.\n\nSimilarly for each t.\n\nNow, start at t=0, y_0=3.\n\nIs y=3 blocked at t=0? y=3 freeway, blocked times t=12,13,14,15, not at t=0. So at t=0, y=3 is safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimum steps: 6 up moves, but might not be possible due to blocks.\n\nSince we can stay or go down, but going down might be necessary to avoid blocks.\n\nFirst, let's see the critical times.\n\nWe can only be on rows 1-8 when not blocked at that time.\n\nFor example, row y=4 is blocked at t=0,1,8,9,10\n\nSo we cannot be on y=4 at t=0,1,8,9,10\n\nSimilarly, rows 5,6,7,8 are blocked only at t=0, so we cannot be on them at t=0, but can be at other times.\n\nRows 1,2,3 blocked at t=12-15.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nStart at t=0, y=3, safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nSince rows 5-8 are blocked at t=0, we cannot go to them at t=0, but since we start at y=3, and at t=0 we are on y=3, which is safe.\n\nNow, we can move at t=0.\n\nOptions: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, y_1 = 4\n\nBut at t=1, if we are on y=4, is it safe?\n\nt=1, y=4 is blocked (since y=4 blocked at t=1), so not safe. Collision.\n\nIf D, y_1=2, which is freeway, at t=1, y=2 blocked times? y=2 blocked only at t=12-15, so at t=1, not blocked, safe.\n\nBut we are going down, away from goal.\n\nIf S, y_1=3, safe.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nNow, at t=0, if we go S, y_1=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=1, we can choose action.\n\nBut we need to consider the path.\n\nSince rows 5-8 are blocked at t=0, we cannot be on them at t=0, but at t=1, they might be safe.\n\nFor example, y=5 at t=1: blocked only at t=0, so at t=1, not blocked, safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut we start at y=3.\n\nNow, the problem is y=4 is blocked at t=0 and t=1, so we cannot be on y=4 at t=0 or t=1.\n\nSimilarly, at later times, it is blocked again at t=8,9,10.\n\nBut since we are starting from t=0, and we need to go up, we must cross y=4 at some point.\n\nBut at t=0 and t=1, we cannot be on y=4.\n\nSo the earliest we can be on y=4 is t=2 or later, but not at t=8,9,10.\n\ny=4 safe times: not blocked when t not in {0,1,8,9,10}, so for t=2 to7, and t>=11.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nWe need to go from y=3 to y=9.\n\nSince y=4 is blocked at t=0 and t=1, we cannot move to y=4 at t=0 or t=1.\n\nAt t=0, if we go U, y_1=4, but at turn t=1, we are on y_1=4, which is blocked at t=1, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go S at t=0, y_1=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=1, if we go U, y_2=4, and at turn t=1, we are still on y=3, not y=4.\n\nAt turn t=1, position y_t = y_1.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, position becomes y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nSo at turn t, we are on y_t, perform a_t, then at turn t+1, we are on y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t if on freeway y_t and blocked at time t.\n\nAt t=0: y_0=3, safe.\n\nAction a_0:\n\n- If U: then y_1 = 4\n\nAt turn t=1, y_1=4, and we need to check if y=4 is safe at t=1. But t=1, y=4 is blocked, so collision at t=1.\n\n- If D: y_1=2, at t=1, y=2 is not blocked (only at 12-15), so safe.\n\n- If S: y_1=3, at t=1, y=3 not blocked (only at 12-15), safe.\n\nSo U is not possible at t=0 because it would cause collision at t=1.\n\nD or S are possible, but D goes down, which might not be efficient.\n\nS keeps position.\n\nBut we need to go up, so perhaps we should S at t=0, then at t=1 go U or something.\n\nAt t=1, if we go U from y=3, y_2=4.\n\nAt turn t=1, we are on y_1, which is 3 if we did S at t=0, or 2 if D, etc.\n\nCase: suppose at t=0, we do S, so y_1=3.\n\nThen at t=1, y_1=3, safe.\n\nAction a_1:\n\n- If U: y_2=4\n\nThen at turn t=2, y_2=4, need to check safety at t=2.\n\nt=2, y=4 blocked times: 0,1,8,9,10. t=2 not in, so safe? y=4 safe at t=2? Blocked times are t=0,1,8,9,10, so at t=2, not blocked, so safe.\n\n- If D: y_2=2, safe\n\n- If S: y_2=3, safe\n\nSo at t=1, we can go U to y_2=4.\n\nThen at turn t=2, we are on y_2=4, which is safe since t=2 not blocked.\n\nNow, from there, we need to go to y=5,6,etc.\n\ny=5 is freeway, blocked only at t=0, so for t>=1, it is safe, since only t=0 blocked.\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8 safe for t>=1.\n\ny=9 always safe.\n\nBut y=4 has later blocks at t=8,9,10, but we are at t=2 now, early.\n\nWe can go up directly.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=2, we can go U to y_3=5 at t=3? Let's see.\n\nAfter action a_1 at t=1, we go to y_2=4 at turn t=2.\n\nThen at turn t=2, we can choose a_2.\n\nIf we go U, y_3=5.\n\nAt turn t=3, we are on y_3=5.\n\ny=5 safe at t=3? Yes, only blocked at t=0.\n\nSimilarly, we can keep going up.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nAlso, there is the issue of rows 1,2,3 blocked at t=12-15, but we are at low y now, t=2, so we can go up before that.\n\nPath: start t=0, y_0=3\n\na_0 = S (stay), so y_1=3\n\nt=1, y_1=3, a_1=U, so y_2=4\n\nt=2, y_2=4, now a_2: we can go U to y_3=5\n\nt=3, y_3=5, go U to y_4=6\n\nt=4, y_4=6, go U to y_5=7\n\nt=5, y_5=7, go U to y_6=8\n\nt=6, y_6=8, go U to y_7=9\n\nNow, at t=7, y_7=9, which is the goal, since y=9.\n\nNow, we need to check for each turn t from 0 to 6, position y_t is safe.\n\nt=0: y=3, safe (not blocked)\n\nt=1: y=3, safe\n\nt=2: y=4, safe (t=2 not blocked for y=4)\n\nt=3: y=5, safe (t=3>0)\n\nt=4: y=6, safe\n\nt=5: y=7, safe\n\nt=6: y=8, safe (t=6>0, not blocked)\n\nt=7: y=9, not a freeway, no issue.\n\nNow, H=7 turns? Actions from t=0 to t=6, 7 actions, y from y_0 to y_7.\n\ny_0=3, after 7 actions, y_7=9.\n\nt=0 to t=6, that's 7 actions.\n\nBut minimal H might be less.\n\nEarlier we couldn't go up at t=0 because it would lead to y=4 at t=1 blocked.\n\nCould we go down first?\n\nFor example, at t=0, go D to y_1=2, then from there go up, but y=2 is safe at t=1, but then we need to go to y=3,4,etc., which might take more time.\n\nFor instance, t=0: a_0=D, y_1=2\n\nt=1: y_1=2, a_1=U, y_2=3\n\nt=2: y_2=3, a_2=U, y_3=4\n\nt=3: y_3=4, a_3=U, y_4=5\n\netc., up to y=9.\n\nBut from y=2 to y=3 to y=4, it takes to t=3 to reach y=4, whereas in the previous path, we reached y=4 at t=2.\n\nIn the first path: at t=2, y=4\n\nIn this, at t=2, y=3? t=0: y=3, a0=D, y1=2\n\nt=1: y1=2, a1=U, y2=3\n\nt=2: y2=3, then a2=U, y3=4 at t=3.\n\nSo y=4 at t=3, later than first path.\n\nThen to y=5 at t=4, etc., so y=9 at t=7 or later? Let's see:\n\nt=0: y0=3, a0=D, y1=2\n\nt=1: y1=2, a1=U, y2=3\n\nt=2: y2=3, a2=U, y3=4\n\nt=3: y3=4, a3=U, y4=5\n\nt=4: y4=5, a4=U, y5=6\n\nt=5: y5=6, a5=U, y6=7\n\nt=6: y6=7, a6=U, y7=8\n\nt=7: y7=8, a7=U, y8=9\n\nSo H=8 actions, worse than first path.\n\nIf at t=0, S, then at t=1 U, to y2=4 at t=2, then U to y3=5 at t=3, etc., to y7=9 at t=7.\n\nIn the first path I had y7=9 at t=7 with actions from t=0 to t=6.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nAt t=0, we cannot go U, as it causes collision.\n\nWhat if we go S at t=0, but then at t=1, instead of U, we go S again? Then we stay at y=3 longer, but we need to go up, so it would take more time.\n\nFor example, t=0 S, y1=3\n\nt=1 S, y2=3\n\nt=2 U, y3=4\n\netc., then y=9 at t=8 or something, worse.\n\nSo the first path seems good: S at t=0, U at t=1, then U all the way to 9.\n\nBut in that path, we reach y=9 at t=7 with 7 actions.\n\nBut is there a way to do in 6 actions?\n\nMinimum 6 actions if all up, but we cannot go up at t=0 because it would make y=4 at t=1 which is blocked.\n\nIf we could go to y=4 at a different time.\n\nBut at t=0, we start at y=3, to go to y=4, we need to move up at some point.\n\nThe move to y=4 happens when we perform U while at y=3.\n\nSuppose at turn t, we are at y=3, and we do U, then at turn t+1, we are at y=4.\n\nBut at turn t+1, we must not be blocked on y=4.\n\ny=4 blocked at t=0,1,8,9,10.\n\nSo for t+1 not in {0,1,8,9,10}, so t+1 >=2 and t+1 <=7 or t+1>=11.\n\nBut t+1= turn when on y=4.\n\nNow, we start at t=0, y=3.\n\nIf we do U at t=0, then at t=1, y=4, but t=1 is blocked, not good.\n\nIf we do something else first.\n\nBut we can only stay or go down at t=0.\n\nIf we go down to y=2 at t=1, then from there.\n\nBut y=2 at t=1 is safe.\n\nThen we can go to y=3 at t=2, by doing U at t=1.\n\nAt t=1: if we are at y=2, do U, then y_2=3 at turn t=2.\n\nThen at turn t=2, we are on y=3, which is safe (only blocked 12-15).\n\nThen from y=3 at t=2, we can do U to go to y=4 at t=3.\n\nThen at turn t=3, y=4, which is safe since t=3 not blocked (blocked only 0,1,8,9,10).\n\nThen go up to y=5 at t=4, etc.\n\nBut to reach y=9:\n\nt=0: start y=3\n\na0: say D, y1=2\n\nt=1: y1=2, a1=U, y2=3\n\nt=2: y2=3, a2=U, y3=4\n\nt=3: y3=4, a3=U, y4=5\n\nt=4: y4=5, a4=U, y5=6\n\nt=5: y5=6, a5=U, y6=7\n\nt=6: y6=7, a6=U, y7=8\n\nt=7: y7=8, need another U to y8=9, so H=8 actions.\n\nWorse than 7.\n\nIf at t=0 we do S, y1=3\n\nt=1: y1=3, instead of U, we do U directly? But at t=1, if we do U, y2=4, then at t=2, y=4 safe.\n\nAs in first path.\n\nt=0: S, y1=3\n\nt=1: U, y2=4\n\nt=2: U, y3=5\n\n...\n\nTo y7=9 at t=7.\n\nCan we reach y=9 at t=6?\n\nThat would require y_6=9.\n\nBut y_0=3, to y_6=9, we need +6 in 6 steps, so all U actions.\n\nBut with actions: if all U from start: a0=U, y1=4\n\nBut at t=1, y1=4, blocked, collision.\n\nIf we start with something else, but we need to go up 6 times, so if we have one S or D, we fall behind.\n\nFor example, if we do S at t=0, then U at t=1, U at t=2, ..., U at t=5, y6=8? Let's see:\n\nt=0: y0=3, a0=S, y1=3\n\nt=1: y1=3, a1=U, y2=4\n\nt=2: y2=4, a2=U, y3=5\n\nt=3: y3=5, a3=U, y4=6\n\nt=4: y4=6, a4=U, y5=7\n\nt=5: y5=7, a5=U, y6=8\n\nThen at t=6, y6=8, not 9. Need another U to y7=9.\n\nSo y7=9.\n\nIf at t=5 we are at y=7, but we need to be at y=9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at t=6, we need y_6=9, which requires that at t=5, we are at y=8 and go U, or at y=9 and stay, but we start from below.\n\ny_6=9 only if we increased by 6 in 6 steps.\n\nBut from t=0 to t=6, 6 actions, y from 3 to 9, delta 6, so all U possible only if no block prevents it.\n\nBut the block at t=1 for y=4 prevents immediate up.\n\nIf we go down first, it takes more steps.\n\nSo probably 7 is minimum.\n\nBut in the sequence above, with 7 actions, we reach in 7 turns.\n\nBut let's confirm the safety at all points.\n\nIn the sequence: t=0: y=3, safe\n\na0=S, so y1=3\n\nt=1: y=3, safe\n\na1=U, so y2=4\n\nt=2: y=4, now t=2, is y=4 safe? Blocked at t=0,1,8,9,10, t=2 not in, so yes safe.\n\na2=U, y3=5\n\nt=3: y=5, safe (blocked only t=0)\n\na3=U, y4=6\n\nt=4: y=6, safe\n\na4=U, y5=7\n\nt=5: y=7, safe\n\na5=U, y6=8\n\nt=6: y=8, safe (blocked only t=0)\n\na6=U, y7=9\n\nAt t=7, y=9, done.\n\nNow, what about later blocks, like y=4 at t=8,9,10, but we are at y=4 only at t=2, early, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, rows 1-3 blocked at t=12-15, but we are above by then.\n\nSo this seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and y=9 is not a freeway, so once we are on y=9, it's fine.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=6, we are at y=8, and after a6=U, y7=9 at turn t=7.\n\nNow, H=7 turns, meaning 7 actions.\n\nBut the player position: at turn t=0, position (0,3), after action a0, at turn t=1 position (0,y1), ..., after action a6, at turn t=7 position (0,9).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, is there a sequence with H=6?\n\nSuppose we can be on y=4 at a safe time earlier.\n\nBut we cannot at t=0 or t=1.\n\nNext safe for y=4 is t=2, as above.\n\nAt t=2, we can be on y=4.\n\nFrom there, to y=9, we need 5 more up moves, so minimum t=7 to reach y=9.\n\ny_2=4, then after 5 U, y_7=9.\n\nt=2 to t=7 is 5 actions? Indices.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn k, position y_k.\n\nStart t=0, y_0=3\n\nAfter first action, t=1, y_1\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at turn H, y_H.\n\nWe want y_H=9.\n\nIn this case, with actions, if we have y_0=3, and after H actions y_H=9.\n\nWith H=6, y_6=9.\n\nBut to have y_6=9, we need to increase by 6 in 6 steps, all U, but cannot because of t=1 block.\n\nIf we have some down, but then net up less, so y_6 <9 if not all up.\n\nFor example, if one down, then to compensate, need extra up, but with 6 actions, if one down, net +4, y_6=7, not 9.\n\nSimilarly, if one stay, net +5, y_6=8, not 9.\n\nOnly all up gives y_6=9.\n\nBut all up not possible due to collision.\n\nTherefore, H=6 impossible, so H=7 is minimal.\n\nIn the sequence above, we used S at first, but we could go down and up, but it takes more time.\n\nAnother idea: what about going to y=0? y=0 is safe, no cars.\n\nFor example, at t=0, go D to y1=2? y1=2.\n\nThen from there, but we need to go up later.\n\nBut it might not help.\n\nFor instance, t=0: D, y1=2\n\nt=1: U, y2=3\n\nt=2: U, y3=4 (safe at t=3? y3=4 at turn t=3, safe)\n\nThen U to y4=5, etc., same as before, reach y=9 at t=7 or later.\n\nt=0: D, y1=2\n\nt=1: U, y2=3\n\nt=2: U, y3=4\n\nt=3: U, y4=5\n\n...\n\ny7=8 at t=7, y8=9 at t=8, H=8.\n\nWorse.\n\nIf from y=2 at t=1, go U to y2=3 at t=2, etc.\n\nStill slower.\n\nSo the sequence with S at t=0 and then U all the way is efficient.\n\nIn that sequence, we have one S and six U, but from y0=3 to y7=9, with actions: a0=S, a1 to a6 all U? Let's list:\n\nt=0: a0=S, y1=3\n\nt=1: a1=U, y2=4\n\nt=2: a2=U, y3=5\n\nt=3: a3=U, y4=6\n\nt=4: a4=U, y5=7\n\nt=5: a5=U, y6=8\n\nt=6: a6=U, y7=9\n\nSo actions: S, U, U, U, U, U, U\n\nNumber: 7 actions.\n\ny increased from 3 to 9, delta 6, with 7 actions because one stay.\n\nBut we have to have the stay to avoid the block.\n\nIf we could go directly at t=0, but cannot.\n\nSo this should be minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions, especially for y=5-8 at t=0.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=0, we are on y=3, not on y=5-8, and at t=0, y=5-8 are blocked, but we are not there, so fine.\n\nAt t=1, y=3, safe.\n\nAt t=2, y=4, safe.\n\nEtc.\n\nNow, the only potential issue is if we need to be on some row at a blocked time, but in this path, we avoid all blocks.\n\nFor example, at t=8,9,10, y=4 is blocked, but we are long past y=4.\n\nSimilarly, t=12-15, y=1-3 blocked, but we are at y=9.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=7.\n\nSequence of actions: for turn t_1 + t, but since t_1=4, and t from 0 to 6.\n\nThe actions are for turns starting from t_1.\n\nSo turn t_1: a_{t_1} = a_4\n\nIn the answer, it should be for each turn.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1=4.\n\nPlayer starts at turn 4, position (0,3)\n\nThen actions for turn 4,5,6,... up to turn 4+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 4+H, position y=9.\n\nIn terms of absolute turns.\n\nSet T = turn.\n\nT=4: position y=3\n\nAfter action a_4, at T=5, position y_5\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{4+H-1}, at T=4+H, position y_{4+H}=9.\n\nH is number of actions.\n\nIn the sequence, with H=7, actions from T=4 to T=10.\n\nT=4: action a_4\n\nT=5: a_5\n\n...\n\nT=10: a_{10}\n\nThen at T=11, position y=9? Let's index.\n\nAt start of T=4, position y=3.\n\nAfter a_4, position for T=5 is set.\n\nSimilarly, after a_{4+H-1}, position for T=4+H is set to 9.\n\nSo T=4+H should be the turn when position is (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nT=4: a_4 = S (since in relative, a0=S)\n\nThen T=5: position y=3, a_5 = U\n\nT=6: position y=4, a_6 = U\n\nT=7: y=5, a_7=U\n\nT=8: y=6, a_8=U\n\nT=9: y=7, a_9=U\n\nT=10: y=8, a_{10}=U\n\nThen at T=11, position y=9.\n\nSo actions from T=4 to T=10, that's 7 actions: T=4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nH=7.\n\nT=4 to T=10 inclusive is 7 turns.\n\nAnswer format should be:\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nThen at turn 11, position (0,9).\n\nBut the sequence is up to turn 10, action a_{10}, which sets position for turn 11.\n\nIn the answer, it should list actions for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=4, H=7, so turns 4 to 4+6=10.\n\nActions: a_4 to a_{10}.\n\nAs above.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's make sure about the car on freeway 4 at t=0.\n\nIn relative t, at t=0, freeway 4 has a car that covers x=0, but at t=0, we are not on y=4, we are on y=3.\n\nAt t=1, we are on y=3, not y=4.\n\nAt t=2, we go to y=4, but t=2 is safe.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 4, there was a car at t=0 and t=1 covering, but we avoid those times.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster by going to higher rows earlier, but since rows 5-8 are blocked at t=0, we cannot be there at t=0, but at t=1, we could be, but we start at y=3, to go to y=5 at t=1, we need to move up twice, but in one step? No, each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo from y=3 at t=0, after one action, at t=1, y=2,3, or4.\n\ny=4 is blocked at t=1, so only y=2 or3 at t=1.\n\nThen from there, to y=5, etc.\n\nCannot reach y=5 until t=2 at earliest, if we go U to y=4 at t=1, but y=4 at t=1 blocked, cannot.\n\nSo at t=1, we can be at y=2 or3.\n\nThen at t=2, if at y=3, go U to y=4 at t=3? Turn: at t=2, position y_2, if y_2=3, do U, then y_3=4 at turn t=3.\n\nThen as before.\n\nIf at t=1 we are at y=2, go U to y=3 at t=2, then U to y=4 at t=3.\n\nSame.\n\nSo cannot be faster.\n\nThus H=7 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 5, we do U, but position at turn 5 is y=3 (after S at turn 4), then after U, at turn 6 position y=4.\n\nIn terms of the action labels.\n\nIn the answer, it should be clear.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut the car state has freeway 5-8 blocked at t=0, which we avoided.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 4 (t=0), we are on y=3, safe.\n\nTurn 5 (t=1), on y=3, safe.\n\nTurn 6 (t=2), on y=4, safe.\n\nEtc.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 7. The sequence of actions must ensure that at each turn, the player is not on a freeway row where \\(x = 0\\) is covered by any car's span at that turn.\n\n### Analysis of Car Blocking Times\nThe blocking times for each freeway (relative to \\(t = 0\\) corresponding to absolute turn \\(t_1 = 4\\)) are:\n- **Freeway 1**: Blocked at \\(t = 12, 13, 14, 15\\) (span: \\([-47 + 3t, -36 + 3t]\\)).\n- **Freeway 2**: Blocked at \\(t = 12, 13, 14, 15\\) (same as Freeway 1).\n- **Freeway 3**: Blocked at \\(t = 12, 13, 14, 15\\) (same as Freeway 1).\n- **Freeway 4**: Blocked at \\(t = 0, 1, 8, 9, 10\\) (spans: \\([-43 + 4t, -32 + 4t]\\), \\([-7 + 4t, 4 + 4t]\\), and \\([29 + 4t, 40 + 4t]\\); only first two cars cover \\(x=0\\) at these times).\n- **Freeway 5**: Blocked only at \\(t = 0\\) (span: \\([-11 + 12t, 12t]\\); only at \\(t=0\\)).\n- **Freeway 6**: Blocked only at \\(t = 0\\) (same as Freeway 5).\n- **Freeway 7**: Blocked only at \\(t = 0\\) (same as Freeway 5).\n- **Freeway 8**: Blocked only at \\(t = 0\\) (same as Freeway 5).\n\nRows \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) have no cars and are always safe.\n\n### Strategy to Minimize Turns\n- The minimum vertical distance to cover is from \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 9\\), requiring a net increase of 6 units. With no obstacles, 6 up actions would suffice in \\(H = 6\\) turns.\n- However, moving up immediately at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) (relative \\(t = 0\\)) to \\(y = 4\\) would place the player on Freeway 4 at absolute turn 5 (relative \\(t = 1\\)), which is blocked, causing a collision.\n- Staying at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 4 (relative \\(t = 0\\)) avoids this collision, as \\(y = 3\\) is safe at \\(t = 0\\) and \\(t = 1\\).\n- From \\(y = 3\\) at turn 5 (relative \\(t = 1\\)), moving up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 6 (relative \\(t = 2\\)) is safe, as Freeway 4 is unblocked at \\(t = 2\\).\n- Subsequent up moves reach \\(y = 9\\) efficiently, with all positions safe:\n  - \\(y = 4\\) at \\(t = 2\\) is safe (not blocked at \\(t = 2\\)).\n  - \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are safe for \\(t \\geq 1\\) (blocked only at \\(t = 0\\)).\n- Attempts to achieve \\(H = 6\\) (e.g., all up actions) fail due to the collision at \\(y = 4\\) and \\(t = 1\\). Any deviation (e.g., down or stay actions) increases \\(H\\) beyond 6. Thus, \\(H = 7\\) is minimal.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 = 4\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 4 + 7 - 1 = 10\\) is:\n- Turn 4: Stay (S) – Player remains at \\(y = 3\\), which is safe at relative \\(t = 0\\).\n- Turn 5: Up (U) – Player moves to \\(y = 4\\) for turn 6; at turn 5, \\(y = 3\\) is safe (relative \\(t = 1\\)).\n- Turn 6: Up (U) – Player moves to \\(y = 5\\) for turn 7; at turn 6, \\(y = 4\\) is safe (relative \\(t = 2\\), not blocked).\n- Turn 7: Up (U) – Player moves to \\(y = 6\\) for turn 8; at turn 7, \\(y = 5\\) is safe (relative \\(t = 3\\), not blocked).\n- Turn 8: Up (U) – Player moves to \\(y = 7\\) for turn 9; at turn 8, \\(y = 6\\) is safe (relative \\(t = 4\\), not blocked).\n- Turn 9: Up (U) – Player moves to \\(y = 8\\) for turn 10; at turn 9, \\(y = 7\\) is safe (relative \\(t = 5\\), not blocked).\n- Turn 10: Up (U) – Player moves to \\(y = 9\\) for turn 11; at turn 10, \\(y = 8\\) is safe (relative \\(t = 6\\), not blocked).\n\nAt turn 11, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) safely.\n\n### Verification\n- **Turn 4 (relative \\(t = 0\\))**: Position \\(y = 3\\), safe (Freeway 3 unblocked at \\(t = 0\\)).\n- **Turn 5 (relative \\(t = 1\\))**: Position \\(y = 3\\), safe (Freeway 3 unblocked at \\(t = 1\\)).\n- **Turn 6 (relative \\(t = 2\\))**: Position \\(y = 4\\), safe (Freeway 4 unblocked at \\(t = 2\\)).\n- **Turn 7 (relative \\(t = 3\\))**: Position \\(y = 5\\), safe (Freeway 5 unblocked for \\(t \\geq 1\\)).\n- **Turn 8 (relative \\(t = 4\\))**: Position \\(y = 6\\), safe (Freeway 6 unblocked for \\(t \\geq 1\\)).\n- **Turn 9 (relative \\(t = 5\\))**: Position \\(y = 7\\), safe (Freeway 7 unblocked for \\(t \\geq 1\\)).\n- **Turn 10 (relative \\(t = 6\\))**: Position \\(y = 8\\), safe (Freeway 8 unblocked for \\(t \\geq 1\\)).\n- Later blocking times (e.g., Freeways 1-3 at \\(t = 12-15\\), Freeway 4 at \\(t = 8-10\\)) are avoided as the player is at \\(y = 9\\) by turn 11.\n\nThus, the minimal \\(H = 7\\) with the specified action sequence.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 6, but in the task, it says \"current turn is {t_1}\", and in the state, it says \"Current Turn: t_0 = 6\", which might be a typo. I think t_0 is meant to be t_1, so I'll assume current turn is 6.\n\nThe player starts at y=4. I need to reach y=9. Since y increases by 1 for U, decreases by 1 for D, or stays for S, the minimum number of moves to go from 4 to 9 is 5 Up actions, but I have to avoid the cars on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe collision rule: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn, then collision occurs. Importantly, when you move to a new row, you are not on that row until the next turn. So, if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you are still on y, and you arrive at y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nThe player update is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so at turn t, you choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo, at turn t, position is (0, y_t), and after action a_t, you move to (0, y_{t+1}) for the next turn.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, collision occurs if y_T is between 1 and 8, and 0 is in the span of some car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nThe note says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you only care about cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, when you arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, you care about cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nNow, the cars are moving. For each car, given its state at t_1=6, I need to compute its span at future turns.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars and their movements.\n\nThe car state is given for each freeway k from 1 to 8.\n\nFor each freeway, there might be multiple cars.\n\nLet me list them:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-30, -41, right, 3)  // head, tail, direction, speed\n\nDirection: right means moving right, so since head is greater than tail? Let's see the span.\n\nFor left-moving: span is [h, τ] with h > τ? No.\n\nFrom the update:\n\nLeft-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nRight-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-30, -41, right, 3)\n\nBut for right-moving, it says span(t1) = [τ, h], so here τ = -41, h = -30? That seems odd because -30 > -41, so if [τ, h] with τ < h, then it's from left to right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, [h, τ] with h > τ, moving left.\n\nIn this case, freeway 1: (-30, -41, right, 3). Since direction is right, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-41, -30], because τ is tail, h is head, so for right-moving, tail is left, head is right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, head is left, tail is right.\n\nBut in the input, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for right-moving, head should be greater than tail if we think of position.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nIn the car state table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for update:\n\nIf d = left, span(t1) = [h, τ] with h > τ? Moving left, so head is at higher x, decreasing.\n\nAssume x-axis, with 0 being the player's x-position.\n\nCars are on horizontal freeways, moving left or right.\n\nPlayer is at x=0 always, I think, since position is (0, y_t).\n\nSo for a car on freeway y, at turn t, if 0 is within its span, collision when player is on that y.\n\nNow for right-moving car: direction right, so it's moving to increasing x.\n\nAt t1, span is given as [τ, h] with τ < h, I think? From the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSo [τ, h] with τ and h, and since moving right, τ should be less than h, so the car is from τ to h, with τ left, h right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)], so h should be greater than τ, h left, τ right, moving left.\n\nIn the input, for freeway 1: (h, τ, d, s) = (-30, -41, right, 3)\n\nBut for right-moving, if span is [τ, h], and τ = -41, h = -30, since -41 < -30, so [τ, h] = [-41, -30], which is from x=-41 to x=-30.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nIn freeway 4, there is (12, 1, right, 4), which would be [τ, h] = [1,12] for right-moving? But [1,12] with τ=1, h=12, so from 1 to 12.\n\nBut in the input it's (head, tail) but in the tuple it's written as (h, τ), so h is head, τ is tail.\n\nFor right-moving, head is the right end, tail is left end.\n\nSo for freeway 1: head = -30, tail = -41, direction right, speed 3.\n\nAt t1=6, span = [τ, h] = [-41, -30] for right-moving? From the rule, for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h], so with τ = tail, h = head, so [tail, head] = [-41, -30].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], with h head, τ tail.\n\nBut in this game, all cars seem to be right-moving except... let's list all.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h, τ, d, s) = (-30, -41, right, 3) → since right, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-41, -30]\n\nFreeway 2: same, (-30, -41, right, 3) → span = [-41, -30]\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-30, -41, right, 3) → span = [-41, -30]\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: \nFirst: (-24, -35, right, 4) → span = [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\nSecond: (12, 1, right, 4) → (h=12, τ=1, d=right, s=4) → span = [τ, h] = [1,12]\nThird: (48, 37, right, 4) → (h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=4) → span = [τ, h] = [37,48]\n\nh=48, τ=37, so [37,48]\n\nFreeway 5: two cars:\nFirst: (24, 13, right, 12) → h=24, τ=13, d=right, s=12 → span = [τ, h] = [13,24]\nSecond: (-48, -59, right, 12) → h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=12 → span = [τ, h] = [-59,-48]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5, (24,13,right,12) and (-48,-59,right,12) → spans [13,24] and [-59,-48]\n\nFreeway 7: same, [13,24] and [-59,-48]\n\nFreeway 8: same, [13,24] and [-59,-48]\n\nNow, t1 = 6.\n\nI need to find when 0 is in the span for each freeway at each turn.\n\nSince the player starts at y=4, and needs to go to y=9, passing through y=5,6,7,8.\n\ny=1,2,3 are below, but since player is at 4 and going up, probably won't go down, so y=1,2,3 might not be relevant, but let's see.\n\nPlayer at y=4 at turn 6.\n\nI need to choose actions for turns starting from t=6 onwards.\n\nLet me denote the turn from t=6.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nFor t=6, y_6 = 4.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 5, if I can go up directly.\n\nBut I have to avoid cars on y=4,5,6,7,8 when I am on those rows.\n\ny=9 is the goal, no car there, I assume, since freeways only y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, no cars mentioned.\n\nIn the collision, only if on freeway y=1 to 8.\n\nSo at y=0 or y=9, no collision.\n\nPlayer starts at y=4, which is a freeway, so at turn 6, if 0 is in span for y=4, collision might occur.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, I need to compute for which turns 0 is in the car span.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, if any car has 0 in span, collision if player is there.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the times when 0 is occupied.\n\nGeneral: for a car, at turn T, span depends on T - t1.\n\nSet t1=6.\n\nFor a right-moving car, span at T is [τ + s(T-6), h + s(T-6)]\n\n0 is in span if τ + s(T-6) <= 0 <= h + s(T-6)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving, so only right-moving case.\n\nAll cars given are right-moving, so only that.\n\nFor a car with span at T: [τ + s(T-6), h + s(T-6)]\n\n0 in span if min <= 0 <= max, so τ + s(T-6) <= 0 <= h + s(T-6)\n\nSince τ <= h, the span is from left to right.\n\nSo 0 in span iff τ + s(T-6) <= 0 and 0 <= h + s(T-6)\n\nBut 0 <= h + s(T-6) is usually true if h and s positive, but h could be negative.\n\nSimilarly, τ + s(T-6) <= 0.\n\nActually, 0 in [L, R] iff L <= 0 <= R.\n\nSo for each car, we can find T such that L <= 0 <= R.\n\nNow, L = τ + s(T-6)\n\nR = h + s(T-6)\n\nSo L <= 0 <= R iff τ + s(T-6) <= 0 and h + s(T-6) >= 0\n\nWhich is s(T-6) <= -τ and s(T-6) >= -h\n\nSo (T-6) <= floor(-τ / s) and (T-6) >= ceil(-h / s) ? Let's see inequalities.\n\nFrom τ + s(T-6) <= 0: s(T-6) <= -τ\n\nSince s > 0, T-6 <= floor(-τ / s) ? No.\n\ns(T-6) <= -τ\n\nIf s divides -τ, etc., but better to keep as inequality.\n\nSimilarly, h + s(T-6) >= 0 implies s(T-6) >= -h\n\nSo -h <= s(T-6) <= -τ\n\nThen T-6 between ceil(-h/s) and floor(-τ/s)? Let's see.\n\nSet k = T - 6, so for integer k >=0, since T >= t1=6.\n\nT is turn, integer.\n\nk = T - 6, k=0,1,2,...\n\nThen for a car, 0 in span at T iff:\n\nτ + s k <= 0 and h + s k >= 0\n\niff s k <= -τ and s k >= -h\n\niff -h <= s k <= -τ\n\nSince s > 0.\n\nNow, k must satisfy ceil(-h/s) <= k <= floor(-τ/s)\n\nBecause s k >= -h, so k >= ceil(-h/s)\n\ns k <= -τ, so k <= floor(-τ/s)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for each car, compute the range of k where it occupies x=0.\n\nThen for each freeway, since multiple cars, if any car occupies 0 at k, then the freeway is occupied at turn T=6+k.\n\nNow, let's go freeway by freeway.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, h=-30, τ=-41, s=3, d=right\n\nCompute -h = -(-30) = 30\n\n-τ = -(-41) = 41\n\ns=3\n\nk >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(30/3) = ceil(10) = 10\n\nk <= floor(-τ/s) = floor(41/3) = floor(13.666) = 13\n\nSo for k from 10 to 13 inclusive, 0 in span.\n\nT = 6 + k, so T=16 to 19.\n\nk=10, T=16; k=11,T=17; k=12,T=18; k=13,T=19.\n\nSo occupied at turns 16,17,18,19.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same car, so same, occupied at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nFreeway 3: same, T=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: h=-24, τ=-35, s=4, d=right\n\n- h = -(-24) = 24\n\n- τ = -(-35) = 35\n\ns=4\n\nk >= ceil(24/4) = ceil(6) = 6\n\nk <= floor(35/4) = floor(8.75) = 8\n\nSo k=6,7,8 → T=12,13,14\n\nT=6+k, k=6,T=12; k=7,T=13; k=8,T=14.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4) → h=12, τ=1, s=4\n\n- h = -12\n\n- τ = -1\n\ns=4\n\nk >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-(-12)/4) = ceil(12/4) = ceil(3) =3? -h = -12, so -(-h) = h? Let's see.\n\nk >= ceil(-h / s) = ceil( -12 / 4 ) = ceil(-3) = -3? That can't be.\n\nMistake.\n\nk >= ceil( -h / s )\n\nh=12, so -h = -12\n\ns=4\n\n- h / s = -12/4 = -3\n\nceil(-3) = -3\n\nBut k = T-6 >=0, so ceil(-3) = -3, but k >=0, so the inequality k >= ceil(-h/s) = -3, which is always true for k>=0.\n\nSimilarly, k <= floor(-τ / s) = floor( -1 / 4 ) = floor(-0.25) = -1? Again, k<= -1, but k>=0, so no overlap.\n\nLet's properly.\n\n0 in span if s k >= -h and s k <= -τ\n\nFor this car: h=12, τ=1, s=4\n\ns k >= -h: 4k >= -12, so k >= -3, always true since k>=0.\n\ns k <= -τ: 4k <= -1, so k <= -0.25, which is impossible since k>=0.\n\nSo no k satisfies, so this car never occupies x=0.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (48,37,right,4) → h=48, τ=37, s=4\n\n- h = -48\n\n- τ = -37\n\ns=4\n\ns k >= -h: 4k >= -48, k >= -12, always true\n\ns k <= -τ: 4k <= -37, k <= -9.25, impossible\n\nSo only first car on freeway 4 occupies x=0 at k=6,7,8, i.e., T=12,13,14.\n\nSo freeway 4 occupied at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,12) → h=24, τ=13, s=12\n\n- h = -24\n\n- τ = -13\n\ns=12\n\ns k >= -h: 12k >= -24, k >= -2, always true\n\ns k <= -τ: 12k <= -13, k <= -13/12 = -1.083, impossible? k <= floor(-13/12) = floor(-1.083) = -2? But k>=0, so no.\n\ns k <= -τ: 12k <= -13, since -13 negative, and 12k >=0, impossible.\n\nSo first car never occupies 0.\n\nSecond car: (-48,-59,right,12) → h=-48, τ=-59, s=12\n\n- h = -(-48) = 48\n\n- τ = -(-59) = 59\n\ns=12\n\nk >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(48/12) = ceil(4) =4\n\nk <= floor(-τ/s) = floor(59/12) = floor(4.916) =4\n\nSo k=4, T=6+4=10\n\nOnly at T=10.\n\nNow, freeway 6: same cars as freeway 5, so same occupancy.\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,12) never occupies 0.\n\nSecond car: (-48,-59,right,12) occupies at k=4, T=10.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 7 and 8, same, occupied only at T=10 by the second car.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 all have the same cars? No, freeway 5 has two cars, but first one never occupies, second occupies at T=10.\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\nNow freeway 1,2,3 occupied at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nFreeway 4 occupied at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow, for freeway 5 to 8, occupied only at T=10.\n\nBut T=10 is at k=4.\n\nNow, player starts at turn 6, y=4.\n\nI need to go from y=4 to y=9.\n\nThe freeways y=1 to 8.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, which is occupied at T=12,13,14.\n\nBut at turn 6, y=4, so I need to check if at T=6, freeway 4 is occupied.\n\nAt T=6, which is k=0.\n\nFor freeway 4, occupied at T=12,13,14, which is k=6,7,8.\n\nAt k=0, T=6, is freeway 4 occupied?\n\nFrom above, for freeway 4, first car: at k=0, L = τ + s k = -35 + 4*0 = -35\n\nR = h + s k = -24 + 0 = -24\n\nSo span [-35,-24], 0 not in, since -35 <= 0 <= -24? 0 > -24? -24 is negative, 0 > -24, but 0 <= -24 is false, since -24 < 0, so 0 not <= R.\n\nSimilarly, other cars don't cover 0 at k=0.\n\nSo at T=6, freeway 4 is not occupied, so player is safe at turn 6.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways at T=6.\n\nFreeway 5: at k=0, second car L= τ + s k = -59 +12*0= -59, R= -48 +0= -48, span [-59,-48], 0 not in.\n\nFirst car not relevant.\n\nSo all freeways safe at T=6.\n\nNow, player at y=4 at turn 6.\n\nI need to move up to y=9.\n\nThe dangerous times are when on a freeway and 0 is occupied.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- For y=4 (freeway 4), occupied at T=12,13,14\n\n- For y=5? Freeway 5 is y=5.\n\nFreeways: k=1 to 8, so y=1 to 8.\n\ny=4: freeway 4\n\ny=5: freeway 5\n\ny=6: freeway 6\n\netc.\n\nFreeway 5: occupied at T=10 only.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: occupied at T=10 only.\n\nFreeway 7: occupied at T=10 only.\n\nFreeway 8: occupied at T=10 only.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3 occupied at T=16,17,18,19, but since we are going up, and y=1,2,3 are below, player won't be there, so irrelevant.\n\nFreeway 4 occupied at T=12,13,14.\n\nPlayer at turn 6, y=4.\n\nIf I go up immediately, I can be at y=5 at turn 7, y=6 at turn 8, and so on.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nSpecifically, for y=5,6,7,8, they are occupied only at T=10.\n\nFor y=4, occupied at T=12,13,14.\n\nSince player starts at y=4 at T=6, I can stay or move.\n\nIf I move up quickly, I might avoid the occupied times.\n\nMinimal turns: from y=4 to y=9, need +5 in y, so at least 5 turns if I go up each time.\n\nBut with actions, each action changes y or not.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy = +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S.\n\nSo to increase y by 5, I need at least 5 U actions, and possibly some S or D, but D would decrease, so to minimize turns, I should only use U and S, no D.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the starting turn? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, with H turns, reaching at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's clarify.\n\nIn the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nAfter action a_t at turn t, we get y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, perform a_t, then at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nStart: turn t=6, position y_6 = 4.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=6 + H, position y_{6+H} should be 9.\n\nThe actions are from a_6 to a_{6+H-1}, so H actions.\n\nAfter a_{6+H-1}, at turn (6+H-1)+1 = 6+H, y_{6+H} =9.\n\nYes.\n\nMinimal H: since need to go from 4 to 9, delta y=5, each U increases by 1, so with all U, H=5 actions: a6 to a10, then at t=11, y=9? Let's see.\n\nAt t=6, y=4\n\nAfter a6: if U, y7=5\n\na7: U, y8=6\n\na8: U, y9=7\n\na9: U, y10=8\n\na10: U, y11=9\n\nSo at t=11, y=9.\n\nH=5 actions, from a6 to a10.\n\nNow, check if collision occurs during the path.\n\nAt each turn t, when y_t is between 1 and 8, check if freeway y_t is occupied at turn t.\n\ny_t is the row at turn t.\n\nFor t=6, y6=4, freeway 4.\n\nIs freeway 4 occupied at t=6? Earlier, at k=0, not occupied, as we saw.\n\nt=7, y7=5 (if we go up), freeway 5.\n\nIs freeway 5 occupied at t=7?\n\nFreeway 5 occupied at T=10 only.\n\nt=7, k=t-6=1, T=7.\n\nAt T=7, is freeway 5 occupied?\n\nFor freeway 5, occupied only at T=10, k=4.\n\nAt k=1, T=7, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, t=8, y8=6, freeway 6, occupied at T=10 only, not at t=8.\n\nt=9, y9=7, freeway 7, not occupied at t=9.\n\nt=10, y10=8, freeway 8.\n\nNow freeway 8 occupied at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, k=4, freeway 8 is occupied, since for freeway 5-8, occupied at T=10.\n\nAt t=10, y10=8, which is freeway 8, and at turn T=10, freeway 8 is occupied, so collision would occur.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=10, y10=8, and freeway 8 occupied at that turn, so collision.\n\nTherefore, cannot go directly up in 5 turns because at t=10, on y=8, occupied.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=8 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7 at t=10 would also be occupied if on them, but in the direct path, at t=10, I am on y=8.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 all occupied at t=10.\n\nFreeways 5,6,7,8 all occupied at T=10.\n\nSo if at turn t, y_t is 5,6,7, or 8, and t=10, collision.\n\nIn the minimal path, I might be on one of them at t=10.\n\nI need to be not on freeways 5-8 at turn 10.\n\nAlso, for y=4, occupied at t=12,13,14.\n\nBut since I start from y=4 at t=6, and going up, I might not stay long.\n\nNow, possible ways: I could delay going up or stay at some row to avoid t=10.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, I could go to y=0 or y=9 earlier, but y=9 is goal.\n\ny=0 is below, but I can go down to avoid.\n\nBut going down might take more turns.\n\nMinimal H should be as small as possible.\n\nSince the problem is only at t=10, if I can be at y=0 or y=9 or y=4 but y=4 not occupied at t=10, etc., at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, which y are safe?\n\nFreeways occupied at t=10: y=5,6,7,8.\n\ny=1,2,3: are they occupied?\n\nEarlier, freeway 1,2,3 occupied at T=16,17,18,19, not at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, k=4.\n\nFreeway 1: for k=4, T=10, is 0 in span?\n\nFor freeway 1 car: at k=4, L = τ + s k = -41 + 3*4 = -41 +12 = -29\n\nR = h + s k = -30 + 12 = -18? h=-30, s=3, k=4, R = h + s k = -30 + 12 = -18\n\nL = τ + s k = -41 + 12 = -29\n\nSpan [-29,-18], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for y=2,3 same.\n\ny=4 at t=10: k=4, T=10.\n\nFreeway 4: occupied at T=12,13,14, not at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, k=4, for freeway 4 first car: L = -35 + 4*4 = -35 +16 = -19\n\nR = -24 +16 = -8\n\nSpan [-19,-8], 0 not in.\n\nOther cars no.\n\nSo y=4 not occupied at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, y=1,2,3 not occupied at t=10.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nSo at t=10, safe rows: y=0,1,2,3,4,9\n\nNot safe: y=5,6,7,8.\n\nIn the path, at turn t=10, I need to be at one of the safe y: 0,1,2,3,4,9.\n\nBut since I am going to y=9, if I can be at y=9 before or at t=10.\n\nIn the direct path, I reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nt=11 is after t=10.\n\nAt t=10, I am at y=8 if going up.\n\nTo avoid, I could reach y=9 earlier, but from y=4, to y=9, minimum 5 up actions, reaching at t=11, cannot be at y=9 at t=10 or earlier.\n\nt=10 is turn 10, at turn t, y_t.\n\nAt turn 10, y_10.\n\nIf I start at t=6, y=4.\n\nAfter 4 actions, at t=10, y_10.\n\nFrom y4 to y10 in 4 steps, each step +1 or 0 or -1.\n\nMaximum y I can be at t=10 is y=4 +4 =8, with all U.\n\nMinimum is y=4 -4=0, with all D.\n\nBut I want to be at safe y at t=10.\n\nSafe y: 0,1,2,3,4,9.\n\nBut 9 impossible at t=10, since from y=4 at t=6, in 4 steps, y <= 8.\n\nSo possible safe y at t=10: 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nThen from there, go to y=9.\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\nI could stay at y=4 for some turns.\n\nFor example, at t=10, if I am at y=4, which is safe.\n\nThen I can go up later.\n\nBut y=4 will be occupied at t=12,13,14, so I need to leave before that.\n\nNow, let's think.\n\nFirst, at turn t=10, I need to be at y <=4 or y=9, but y=9 impossible, so y=0,1,2,3, or 4.\n\nSince I am starting from y=4, and going up, it might be efficient to stay at y=4 or go down a bit.\n\nBut going down might not help.\n\nMinimal H: if I can be at y=4 at t=10, then go up to y=9 in 5 more turns, reaching at t=15, H=9 actions? Let's see.\n\nActions from t=6 to t=6+H-1, reaching at t=6+H.\n\nIf I reach at t=15, H=9 actions.\n\nBut I might do better.\n\nSince the only danger is at t=10 for y=5-8, I can be at y=4 at t=10, then go up.\n\nAt t=10, y=4 is safe, as we saw.\n\nThen from there, I can go up to y=9 in 5 turns: from t=10 to t=14, actions to go up.\n\nBut at t=12,13,14, y=4 is occupied if I stay, but I will be moving.\n\nAfter t=10, I start from y=4.\n\nSet t=10 as new start.\n\nAt t=10, y=4.\n\nThen if I go up: a10: U, y11=5\n\na11: U, y12=6\n\na12: U, y13=7\n\na13: U, y14=8\n\na14: U, y15=9\n\nBut now, check collisions.\n\nAt t=10, y10=4, freeway 4, not occupied at t=10, ok.\n\nt=11, y11=5, freeway 5.\n\nIs freeway 5 occupied at t=11?\n\nFreeway 5 occupied only at T=10, not at t=11.\n\nAt t=11, k=5, T=11.\n\nFor freeway 5 second car: occupied at k=4, T=10.\n\nAt k=5, L = τ + s k = -59 +12*5 = -59 +60 =1\n\nR = h + s k = -48 +60=12\n\nSpan [1,12], 0 not in, since 1>0? 0 <1, not <=0? L=1, R=12, 0 not in [1,12], since 0<1.\n\nSimilarly, first car not, so not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6,7,8 same, occupied only at T=10, not before or after.\n\nAt t=11, y11=5, freeway 5 not occupied, ok.\n\nt=12, y12=6, freeway 6 not occupied, ok.\n\nBut at t=12, also, if I am on y=6, but freeway 6 not occupied at t=12.\n\nNow, problem at t=12: y12=6, but also freeway 4 is occupied at t=12, but I am not on y=4.\n\nt=12, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6: at t=12, k=6, T=12.\n\nFor second car: L = -59 +12*6 = -59+72=13\n\nR = -48 +72=24\n\nSpan [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nFirst car not, so ok.\n\nSimilarly t=13, y13=7, freeway 7 not occupied.\n\nt=14, y14=8, freeway 8 not occupied.\n\nt=15, y15=9, goal, no car.\n\nBut what about freeway 4 occupied at t=12,13,14? But I am not on it, so no issue.\n\nIn this sequence, from t=10 to t=15, I go up from y=4 to y=9 in 5 turns.\n\nBut I need to get to t=10 at y=4.\n\nCurrently, from start: t=6, y=4.\n\nI need to be at y=4 at t=10.\n\nThat means from t=6 to t=10, I need to have y_t such that at t=10, y=4.\n\nAt t=6, y=4.\n\nSo I can stay at y=4 for 4 turns: actions a6=S, a7=S, a8=S, a9=S, then at t=10, y10=4.\n\nThen from t=10, as above, a10=U, y11=5; a11=U, y12=6; a12=U, y13=7; a13=U, y14=8; a14=U, y15=9.\n\nSo at t=15, y=9.\n\nH = number of actions: from a6 to a14, that's 9 actions: t=6 to t=14, actions, then t=15 position.\n\nH actions, indices from 0 to H-1, so a6 to a_{6+H-1}.\n\nAfter a_{6+H-1}, y_{6+H}.\n\nSet to 9.\n\nSo y_{6+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, y15=9, so 6+H=15, H=9.\n\nActions: a6 to a14.\n\nSequence: a6=S, a7=S, a8=S, a9=S, then a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U, a14=U.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=9.\n\nI might go up earlier but avoid being on y=5-8 at t=10.\n\nFor example, go up to y=4 or below before t=10.\n\nBut y=4 is safe at t=10.\n\nSince I start at y=4, staying is fine.\n\nBut I could go up to y=8 or something before t=10, but y=8 at t=10 is not safe.\n\nt=10 is the critical point.\n\nAt t=10, I must not be on y=5,6,7,8.\n\nI can be on y=4, which is safe.\n\ny=3, etc., but that might require going down, which takes extra moves.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=3 at t=10, then I need to come back up, more moves.\n\nSo staying at y=4 is efficient.\n\nBut H=9 seems large, minimal should be 5 but not possible.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 faster by not staying.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=9 but skip the occupied times.\n\nFor example, from t=6, y=4, I can go to y=5 at t=7, y=6 at t=8, but then at t=9, if I go to y=7, then at t=10, I would be at y=8 if I continue, but I can stay or something.\n\nAt t=9, y9, if I am at y=6, for example.\n\nList possible paths.\n\nSet the actions.\n\nI need to have at t=10, y10 not in {5,6,7,8}.\n\nSo y10 <=4 or y10=9, but y10=9 impossible.\n\nSo y10 <=4.\n\nSince y start at 4, and I can stay or go down.\n\nIf I go down, it takes extra to come up.\n\nSo best to stay at y=4 until after t=10.\n\nBut at t=10, y=4 is safe.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut y=4 will be occupied at t=12,13,14, so I need to be off y=4 by then.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=10, y=4, then I go up immediately, so at t=11, y=5, not on y=4, so when t=12, I am on y=6, not on y=4, so ok.\n\nIn the sequence: at t=12, y=6, not on y=4, so freeway 4 occupied but I not there.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, can I do with fewer than 9 actions?\n\nFor example, if I start going up earlier.\n\nSuppose at t=6, I go up: a6=U, y7=5\n\nt=7, y7=5\n\nNow at t=7, freeway 5 not occupied, ok.\n\nThen a7=U, y8=6\n\nt=8, y8=6, freeway 6 not occupied, ok.\n\na8=U, y9=7\n\nt=9, y9=7, freeway 7 not occupied, ok.\n\nNow at t=9, y9=7.\n\nI need to choose a9.\n\nIf a9=U, then y10=8, but at t=10, y10=8, occupied, collision.\n\nIf a9=S, then y10=7, but at t=10, y10=7, freeway 7 occupied at t=10, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if a9=D, y10=6, then at t=10, y10=6, occupied, collision.\n\nSo at t=9, whatever I do, at t=10, I will be on y=7,6, or 8, all occupied at t=10.\n\ny=7 if stay, y=6 if down, y=8 if up, all bad.\n\nSo if I am on y=7 at t=9, I cannot avoid being on a bad row at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, if I am on y=6 at t=9.\n\nt=9, y9=6.\n\nThen a9: if U, y10=7, occupied.\n\nS, y10=6, occupied.\n\nD, y10=5, occupied at t=10.\n\nAll bad.\n\nSimilarly, on y=5 at t=9: y10=6,5, or4.\n\nIf y10=4, that is safe.\n\nIf at t=9, I am on y=5, and I do a9=D, then y10=4, which is safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nLet's see.\n\nStart: t=6, y6=4\n\na6=U, y7=5\n\nt=7, y7=5, safe\n\na7=U, y8=6\n\nt=8, y8=6, safe\n\na8: now, if a8=U, y9=7, then as above, stuck.\n\nInstead, a8=S, y9=6\n\nBut at t=9, y9=6, then a9: if I do D, y10=5, but y=5 occupied at t=10.\n\ny10=5, occupied.\n\nIf a9=S, y10=6, occupied.\n\nOnly if I can go to y=4 at t=10.\n\nBut from y=6 at t=9, I can do a9=D, y10=5, but y=5 occupied, or a9=U, y10=7, occupied.\n\nCannot reach y=4 in one step from y=6.\n\ny10 must be y9 + Δy, so from y9=6, y10=5,6,7.\n\nAll occupied except if y=4, but not possible.\n\ny=4 not reachable from y=6 in one step.\n\nSo if at t=9, I am on y=6, I must be on y=5,6, or7 at t=10, all occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=5 at t=9: y10=4,5,6.\n\ny10=4 is safe, y10=5 and 6 occupied.\n\nSo if I can be at y=5 at t=9, and do a9=D, then y10=4, safe.\n\nThen from t=10, y=4, go up as before.\n\nNow, how to be at y=5 at t=9.\n\nFrom start: t=6, y=4.\n\nTo be at y=5 at t=9.\n\nt=9, y9=5.\n\nFrom t=6 to t=9, 3 actions: a6,a7,a8, to go from y6=4 to y9=5, so net +1 in y.\n\nPossible: for example, a6=U, y7=5; then a7=S, y8=5; a8=S, y9=5.\n\nOr a6=S, y7=4; a7=U, y8=5; a8=S, y9=5.\n\nEtc.\n\nThen at t=9, y9=5.\n\nThen a9=D, y10=4.\n\nThen at t=10, y10=4, safe.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\na10=U, y11=5\n\na11=U, y12=6\n\na12=U, y13=7\n\na13=U, y14=8\n\na14=U, y15=9\n\nBut y15=9 at t=15.\n\nH=10 actions? a6 to a14, 9 actions? t=6 to t=14 actions, y15=9.\n\na6 to a14 is 9 actions: indices from 6 to 14 inclusive, that's 9 actions.\n\nH=9, same as before.\n\nIn this case, I have one more action: a9=D.\n\nBut in the previous stay, I had a6 to a9=S, then U.\n\nHere: for example, a6=U, a7=S, a8=S, a9=D, then a10=U to a14=U.\n\na9=D, which is down, but then I have to go up again, so more moves.\n\nBut still H=9.\n\nIn the first sequence with all stay, I had 4 S then 5 U, total 9 actions.\n\nHere I have some U earlier but then a D, so net same or worse.\n\nBut I reach at same t=15.\n\nNow, to save time, perhaps I can go up faster after t=10.\n\nBut from y=4 to y=9, min 5 U, so t=10 to t=15.\n\nCannot be faster.\n\nUnless I can be at higher y at t=10, but at t=10, I must be at y<=4.\n\nSo maximum at t=10 is y=4, if I don't go down.\n\nThen from y=4 at t=10, min to y=9 at t=15.\n\nSo H min is 9, with reach at t=15.\n\nBut earlier with direct, I could reach at t=11 but collision at t=10.\n\nt=11 reach with collision.\n\nNow, another possibility: since at t=10, y=4 is safe, but also y=3,2,1,0 are safe, but lower.\n\nI could go to y=9 before t=10, but impossible from y=4 at t=6.\n\nMinimal time to y=9 is t=11 with all U.\n\nBut at t=10, on y=8, occupied.\n\nUnless I can be on y=9 at t=10, but cannot.\n\nPerhaps I can skip some rows or something, but no, I have to go through each y.\n\nAnother idea: stay at y=4 for fewer turns.\n\nFor example, at t=6, y=4, I can go up to y=5 at t=7, but then I need to come down to avoid t=10.\n\nBut coming down takes extra moves.\n\nFor instance: a6=U, y7=5\n\na7=U, y8=6\n\na8=D, y9=5  // down to y=5 at t=9\n\nThen at t=9, y9=5\n\nThen a9=D, y10=4  // to y=4 at t=10\n\nThen a10=U, y11=5\n\na11=U, y12=6\n\na12=U, y13=7\n\na13=U, y14=8\n\na14=U, y15=9\n\nStill t=15, H=9.\n\nAnd I used a8=D and a9=D, which cost more.\n\nWorse.\n\nFrom y=5 at t=9, instead of going down, but I have to to avoid t=10.\n\nNo better.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 directly after t=10, but same.\n\nNow, what about the occupation of y=4 later? But in the sequence, when I go up from t=10, I leave y=4 before t=12.\n\nt=10, y=4; t=11, y=5; so not on y=4 at t=12.\n\nt=12, y=6 or whatever.\n\nNow, but in the first sequence with all stay until t=10, then up, it works with H=9.\n\nBut can I start going up earlier and still avoid?\n\nFor example, suppose I go to y=4 at t=10, but with fewer stay actions.\n\nAt t=6, y=4.\n\nIf I do nothing, I stay.\n\nBut I can go down and up, but that might not help.\n\nSince between t=6 and t=10, freeways are not occupied except at specific times, but for example, at t=7, y=5 might be safe, etc., but the issue is only at t=10 for y=5-8.\n\nSo I can be on y=5-8 before or after t=10, as long as not at t=10.\n\nFor example, I can go to y=5 at t=7, which is safe, then stay or move.\n\nBut at t=10, I need to not be there.\n\nSo, for instance: a6=U, y7=5  // t=7, y=5, safe\n\nNow at t=7, y=5.\n\nI can stay for some time.\n\nBut at t=10, I must not be on y=5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSuppose: a6=U, y7=5\n\nThen a7=S, y8=5  // still at y=5\n\na8=S, y9=5  // t=9, y=5\n\nThen at t=9, I need to go down: a9=D, y10=4  // to y=4 at t=10\n\nThen proceed up: a10=U, y11=5; ... to a14=U, y15=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nAfter being at y=5, I could go up to y=6 or higher, but then I have to come down for t=10.\n\nFor example: a6=U, y7=5\n\na7=U, y8=6\n\na8=U, y9=7  // now at t=9, y=7\n\nBut from here, to avoid t=10, I need to go to y=4, but I can only go to y=6,5, or stay at 7.\n\nAll lead to occupied at t=10.\n\nIf I go down earlier.\n\na6=U, y7=5\n\na7=D, y8=4  // back to y=4 at t=8\n\nThen I am at y=4 at t=8.\n\nThen I can stay: a8=S, y9=4\n\na9=S, y10=4  // at t=10, y=4\n\nThen a10=U, y11=5; a11=U, y12=6; a12=U, y13=7; a13=U, y14=8; a14=U, y15=9\n\nStill same, but I used a7=D, which is extra down, so I have to go up later, but net y change same, time same.\n\nIn this case, I reached y=4 at t=8, then stayed until t=10, then up.\n\nBut reached at t=15 same.\n\nNow, since I am at y=4 earlier, can I start going up before t=10?\n\nFor example, from t=8, y=4, I could go up: a8=U, y9=5\n\nBut then at t=9, y=5, then I need to go down for t=10: a9=D, y10=4\n\nThen same as before.\n\nIf I don't go up at t=8, stay.\n\nBut in all cases, I end up with H=9.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 at t=14 or something.\n\nFor example, if I can be at higher y at t=10, but cannot.\n\nAnother thought: y=4 is safe at t=10, but also at other times except t=12-14.\n\nBut since I leave before that.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, when I go up from y=4 at t=10, I go to y=5 at t=11, which is after t=10, so freeway 5 not occupied, ok.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut is there a way to reach y=9 faster?\n\nFor example, suppose I go up to y=8 before t=10, but then at t=10 I need to be not on y=8, so I must leave before, but to where? y=7 or down, but all occupied at t=10.\n\nUnless I go to y=9 before t=10, impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=9 at t=10, but cannot.\n\nt=10 is turn 10, at turn 10, y_10.\n\nIf y_10=9, then I reached, but from y=4 at t=6, in 4 steps, max y=8, min y=0, so y=9 impossible at t=10.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 9, with reaching at t=15.\n\nBut let's confirm if with H=8 possible.\n\nH=8 actions: a6 to a13, then y14=9.\n\ny14=9.\n\nStart from y6=4, after 8 actions, y14=9.\n\nNet delta y = +5 in 8 steps, so possible with 5 U and 3 S, or 5 U, 2 S, 1 D, etc., but since D decreases, need more U, so best 5 U and 3 S.\n\nNow, y14=9.\n\nNow, the turns: t from 6 to 13 for actions, positions y_t for t=6 to 14.\n\ny_t for t=7 to 14 are positions after actions.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nFor t=6 to 14.\n\ny6=4.\n\ny14=9.\n\nNow, at t=10, y10 must be <=4 or 9, but y10=9 impossible since from y6=4 to y10, 4 steps, y10<=8.\n\nSo y10 <=4.\n\nSimilarly, y10 must be in {0,1,2,3,4}.\n\nNow, to have y14=9, from y10, need +5 in 4 steps (from t=10 to t=14, actions a10 to a13, 4 actions to go to y14 from y10).\n\ny10 to y14 in 4 actions, delta y from y10 to y14=9.\n\nSo if y10 <=4, then to reach y14=9, need at least 5 - (4 - y10) if y10<4, but let's see min y10.\n\nIf y10=4, then need +5 in 4 actions, impossible, since max +4 with 4 U.\n\ny10 to y14: after 4 actions, y14 = y10 + sum delta, each delta <=1, so y14 <= y10 +4.\n\nBut y14=9, so y10 +4 >=9, so y10 >=5.\n\nBut earlier, for t=10, to be safe, y10 <=4 or 9, but y10=9 impossible, so y10 <=4.\n\nBut y10 >=5 and y10 <=4 contradiction.\n\nTherefore impossible to have y14=9 with y10 <=4.\n\nBecause y10 <=4 implies y14 <=4 +4 =8 <9.\n\nIf y10=4, y14 <=8.\n\nIf y10=3, y14<=7, worse.\n\nSo indeed, to reach y14=9, we must have y10 >=5.\n\nBut y10 >=5, and at t=10, y=5,6,7,8 are all occupied, so collision inevitable if y10 >=5.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach y=9 at t=14 or earlier than t=15.\n\nt=15 is the earliest possible with y10 <=4 and y15=9.\n\nWith y10=4, then y11=5, y12=6, y13=7, y14=8, y15=9.\n\nOr if I can go faster, but from y10=4, min to y=9 is 5 steps, y15=9.\n\nSo t=15 is minimal.\n\nThus H=9 actions.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to specify actions from a6 to a14.\n\nIn the first plan: stay at y=4 until t=10, then go up.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 6: S (stay at y=4)\n\nTurn 7: S (y=4)\n\nTurn 8: S (y=4)\n\nTurn 9: S (y=4)  // at t=10, y=4\n\nThen\n\nTurn 10: U (to y=5)\n\nTurn 11: U (to y=6)\n\nTurn 12: U (to y=7)\n\nTurn 13: U (to y=8)\n\nTurn 14: U (to y=9)  // at t=15, y=9\n\nNow, check for collisions.\n\nAt each turn, when on freeway 1-8, check if occupied.\n\nt=6: y=4, freeway 4. At T=6, not occupied, as earlier. Safe.\n\nt=7: y=4, freeway 4. T=7, k=1, not occupied (only at T=12,13,14). Safe.\n\nt=8: y=4, freeway 4. T=8, k=2, not occupied. Safe.\n\nt=9: y=4, freeway 4. T=9, k=3, not occupied. Safe.\n\nt=10: y=4, freeway 4. T=10, k=4, not occupied (as computed, span [-19,-8] for freeway 4). Safe.\n\nt=11: y=5, freeway 5. T=11, k=5. For freeway 5, at T=11, not occupied. Safe.\n\nt=12: y=6, freeway 6. T=12, k=6. Freeway 6 not occupied. Also, freeway 4 occupied at T=12, but I am on y=6, not y=4. Safe.\n\nt=13: y=7, freeway 7. T=13, not occupied. Safe.\n\nt=14: y=8, freeway 8. T=14, not occupied (only at T=10). Safe.\n\nt=15: y=9, goal, no issue.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nI could have different actions, but this works with H=9.\n\nIn the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=6.\n\nSequence of actions from a_6 to a_{14}.\n\nIn the format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nHere H=9, so from t=6 to t=14.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 6 + 9 -1 =14.\n\nYes.\n\nActions: for t=6 to 9: S, t=10 to 14: U.\n\nBut t=10: action a10, which is U, leading to y11=5.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nIn the freeway, for y=5,6,7,8, they are only occupied at t=10, which we avoided.\n\nIn the sequence, when we are on them at t=11,12,13,14, not occupied.\n\nAlso, for y=4, we left before t=12.\n\nSo all good.\n\nI think this is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, to write in the boxed format.\n\nBut in the action, for turn, it should be specified.\n\nAlso, in the car state, there is freeway 4 with multiple cars, but we handled.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 4, at t=12,13,14 occupied, but we not there.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think fine.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) if the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y_T \\leq 8\\)) and the x-position 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Occupancy at x=0\nThe occupancy of x=0 for each freeway at relevant turns is determined based on the car states at turn 6. The turns when x=0 is occupied for each freeway are:\n- Freeway 4 (y=4): Occupied at turns 12, 13, 14.\n- Freeways 5 to 8 (y=5 to y=8): Occupied only at turn 10.\n- Freeways 1 to 3 (y=1 to y=3): Occupied at turns 16, 17, 18, 19, but since the player moves upward from y=4, these are not relevant.\n\nAt turn 10, freeways y=5 to y=8 are occupied, so the player must not be on these rows at turn 10 to avoid collision. Safe rows at turn 10 are y=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 9, but y=9 is unreachable by turn 10 from y=4 at turn 6. Thus, the player must be at y ≤ 4 at turn 10.\n\n### Strategy\n- From turn 6 to turn 9, stay at y=4 (using \"S\" actions) to avoid moving to rows that might be occupied prematurely and to ensure the player is at y=4 at turn 10 (which is safe).\n- From turn 10 to turn 14, move upward with \"U\" actions to reach y=9 at turn 15.\n\nThis strategy uses \\(H = 9\\) actions (turns 6 to 14) and reaches y=9 at turn 15. A shorter sequence is impossible because:\n- Reaching y=9 by turn 14 (with \\(H=8\\)) would require y=9 at turn 14, which implies y must be at least 5 at turn 10 (since y increases by at most 1 per action). However, y ≥ 5 at turn 10 causes collision on freeways 5-8.\n- Thus, turn 15 is the earliest possible arrival at y=9.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns 6 to 14 is:\n- Turn 6: S (stay at y=4)\n- Turn 7: S (stay at y=4)\n- Turn 8: S (stay at y=4)\n- Turn 9: S (stay at y=4)\n- Turn 10: U (move to y=5)\n- Turn 11: U (move to y=6)\n- Turn 12: U (move to y=7)\n- Turn 13: U (move to y=8)\n- Turn 14: U (move to y=9)\n\n### Collision Check\n- Turns 6-9: Player at y=4. Freeway 4 is occupied only at turns 12-14, so no collision.\n- Turn 10: Player at y=4. Freeway 4 is not occupied at turn 10 (span [-19, -8]), so no collision.\n- Turn 11: Player at y=5.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,5) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1 = 8, and I'm at y=5.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. Each car has a head and tail, and they move left or right based on their direction. The collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for a car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nAlso, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is above all freeways, so once I'm at y=9, I don't have to worry about cars anymore. y=9 is the top, and freeways are from 1 to 8.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, and I start at y=5.\n\nNow, let's list the cars for each freeway at turn t1=8.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (-24, -35, right, 3). Direction right, so it's moving right. Head is -24, tail is -35? That seems odd because usually head should be greater than tail for right-moving, but here head=-24, tail=-35, which means tail is more negative, so if it's moving right, the span should be from tail to head, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the car span definition.\n\nFor left-moving: span at t1 is [h, τ], and at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span at t1 is [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nSimilarly for left, [h, τ] to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT].\n\nSo for a right-moving car, at time t, the span is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)], with τ and h given at t1.\n\nSimilarly for left.\n\nIn the state, for freeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 3). Since it's right-moving, span at t1=8 is [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? But it says (head h, tail τ), so for right-moving, head is the front when moving right, so if moving right, head should be larger than tail.\n\nHere, h = -24, τ = -35, so h > τ, so for right-moving, the span is from τ to h, so [ -35, -24 ].\n\nAt time t, position is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)] = [-35 + 3(t-8), -24 + 3(t-8)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for a car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that exact turn T.\n\nAlso, when I move, I change y at the next turn.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H, meaning the number of actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H-1, y=9.\n\nStart at t1=8, y=5.\n\nAfter one action at t=8, y changes at t=9, and so on.\n\nLet me define the turn index.\n\nAt turn t, I perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, based on a_t.\n\nSo at time t, position is (0, y_t).\n\nAction a_t is taken at turn t, affecting y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, we check if player is on freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8), and if for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at time T.\n\nThe span is checked at time T, the turn number.\n\nIn this case, t1=8 is current turn, so at t=8, I am at y=5, which is freeway 5? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=5 is freeway 5.\n\ny=5 is a freeway, so I need to check if there is a collision at current turn if I stay or something, but I have to take actions.\n\nAt turn t, before action, I am at y_t.\n\nI take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t, I am present on y_t, so if y_t is between 1 and 8, I need to not have collision with cars on y_t at time t.\n\nSimilarly, at each turn, for the y I am on, no car should have 0 in span at that turn.\n\nNow, for freeway y=5, at turn t=8.\n\nCars on freeway 5: (48, 37, right, 12), and (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nBoth right-moving.\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, right, s=12.\n\nAt t=8, span is [τ, h] = [37, 48]? Since right-moving, span is [τ + s(t-t1), h + s(t-t1)] but t1=8, so at t=8, Δt=0, so span is [τ, h] = [37, 48]? But it says (head h, tail τ), so for right, head is larger, so [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nIn this case, τ=37, h=48, so [37,48].\n\n0 is not in [37,48], so no issue.\n\nSecond car: h=-24, τ=-35, right, s=12.\n\nAt t=8, span [τ, h] = [-35, -24], 0 not in.\n\nSo at t=8, on y=5, no collision.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal vertical move: from y=5 to y=9, I need to go up 4 units. Each up action moves +1, down -1, stay 0.\n\nSo minimum 4 up actions, but I might need to wait or avoid cars, so H could be more than 4.\n\nBut since I can only move one step per turn, minimum H is 4, if I can go straight up without collision.\n\nBut I have to go through freeways 6,7,8 to reach 9.\n\ny=5 to y=6, then 7,8,9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, it's safe.\n\nFreeways are 1 to 8, so y=9 is above, no cars.\n\nSo I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nNow, I need to check for each freeway I might be on, at each turn, whether there is a car that covers x=0.\n\nSince the player is always at x=0, collision if 0 in car span at that turn on that freeway.\n\nNow, let's model the car positions over time.\n\nSet t=0 as t1=8, so current time is t=0 for simplicity.\n\nSo at time t (turn number from start), player position y_t.\n\nt=0: y=5\n\nAction a_t at time t, affects y_{t+1}.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nCollision at time t if y_t ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} and for some car on freeway y_t, 0 ∈ span at time t.\n\nNow, for each freeway, list the cars and their span over time.\n\nFirst, freeway k=1: car: h=-24, τ=-35, right, s=3\n\nAt time t (since t1=8, absolute turn is 8+t, but since we care about span at time, let's use relative time τ = t, with τ=0 at t1=8.\n\nSo for a car, span at time τ is:\n\nFor right-moving: [τ_car + s * τ, h_car + s * τ] where τ_car and h_car are at τ=0.\n\nSimilarly for left.\n\nFor freeway 1: right-moving, s=3, at τ=0, span [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nSo at time τ, span: [-35 + 3τ, -24 + 3τ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-24, -35, right, 3), so identical to k=1.\n\nh=-24, τ=-35, right, s=3, same as k=1.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3: same, (-24, -35, right, 3)\n\nSo freeways 1,2,3 all have the same car: at time τ, span [-35 + 3τ, -24 + 3τ]\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars: (-16, -27, right, 4), (20, 9, right, 4), (56, 45, right, 4)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nFirst car: h=-16, τ=-27? Head h=-16, tail τ=-27, so for right-moving, span at τ=0: [τ, h] = [-27, -16]\n\nAt time τ: [-27 + 4τ, -16 + 4τ]\n\nSecond car: (20, 9, right, 4), head=20, tail=9, span at τ=0: [9,20]\n\nAt τ: [9 + 4τ, 20 + 4τ]\n\nThird car: (56,45, right,4), head=56, tail=45, span at τ=0: [45,56]\n\nAt τ: [45 + 4τ, 56 + 4τ]\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars: (48, 37, right, 12), and (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, right, s=12, span at τ=0: [37,48]? [τ, h] = [37,48]\n\nAt τ: [37 + 12τ, 48 + 12τ]\n\nSecond car: h=-24, τ=-35, right, s=12, span at τ=0: [-35, -24]\n\nAt τ: [-35 + 12τ, -24 + 12τ]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5? (48,37,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12), identical to freeway 5.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same, (48,37,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: same, (48,37,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nSo freeways 5,6,7,8 all have the same car setup: two cars, one with span at τ: [37 + 12τ, 48 + 12τ] and [-35 + 12τ, -24 + 12τ]\n\nNow, I need to go from y=5 to y=9.\n\nAt τ=0, y=5.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince I can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, to increase from 5 to 9, I need at least 4 up actions.\n\nH is the number of actions, from τ=0 to τ=H-1, and at turn τ=H-1, y_H =9? Let's see the indices.\n\nAt time τ, y_τ is position before action a_τ.\n\nAfter action a_τ, y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ.\n\nSo at time τ, position y_τ.\n\nAfter H actions, from τ=0 to τ=H-1, the positions are from y_0 to y_H.\n\ny_0 =5\n\ny_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\n...\n\ny_H = y_0 + sum_{t=0}^{H-1} Δy_t\n\nWe want y_H =9.\n\nSince y_H =5 + sum_{t=0}^{H-1} Δy_t\n\nAnd Δy_t ∈ {-1,0,1}, so to have y_H=9, sum must be +4, so at least 4 up actions, and H at least 4.\n\nNow, at each time τ, if y_τ between 1 and 8, need no collision.\n\ny_τ=5 at τ=0 is safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nThe critical part is when I am on y=6,7,8 at some turns.\n\nAlso, I might need to stay or move down to avoid, but since I want to go up, moving down might not help, or only if I need to wait.\n\nBut let's first try to go straight up as fast as possible.\n\nAssume I do all up actions: a_t = U for t=0,1,2,3.\n\nThen y_0=5\n\na_0=U, y_1=6\n\na_1=U, y_2=7\n\na_2=U, y_3=8\n\na_3=U, y_4=9\n\nSo at τ=4, y_4=9, so H=4 actions from τ=0 to 3.\n\nNow, check for collision at each turn τ from 0 to 3.\n\nAt τ=0: y=5, freeway 5.\n\nCars: [37 +12τ, 48+12τ] and [-35+12τ, -24+12τ] at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0: [37,48] and [-35,-24], neither contains 0, so safe.\n\nAt τ=1: y=6? At time τ, position y_τ.\n\nAfter a_0=U at τ=0, y_1=6, so at time τ=1, y_1=6.\n\nNow, at τ=1, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nCars on freeway 6: same as 5, since all 5-8 same.\n\nSpan at τ=1: first car [37 +12*1, 48+12*1] = [49,60]\n\nSecond car [-35 +12*1, -24+12*1] = [-23, -12]\n\n0 not in [49,60] nor [-23,-12], so safe.\n\nAt τ=2: y_2=7 (since a_1=U)\n\nFreeway 7, cars at τ=2: [37+24, 48+24]= [61,72] and [-35+24, -24+24]= [-11, 0]\n\n[-11, 0], 0 is included? [ -11, 0 ], is 0 in the interval?\n\nThe span is [τ_min, τ_max], and if it includes 0.\n\n[ -11, 0 ], so from -11 to 0 inclusive? I think it's a closed interval.\n\nIn the definition, it says \"0 ∈ Span(T)\", so if 0 is between min and max inclusive.\n\nHere, at τ=2, for second car, span [-35 +12*2, -24 +12*2] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0]\n\n-11 <= 0 <= 0, yes, 0 is in [-11,0], so collision at τ=2 on freeway 7.\n\nBut at τ=2, y=7, which is freeway 7, and car on freeway 7 has span including 0 at τ=2.\n\nSpecifically, the second car: [-11,0] contains 0.\n\nSo if I am on y=7 at τ=2, collision.\n\nIn this sequence, at τ=2, y_2=7, and freeway 7 has collision, so I cannot be there.\n\nThus, going straight up causes collision at τ=2 on y=7.\n\nSo I need to avoid that.\n\nI could delay or something.\n\nSince the car is at x=0 only at τ=2 for that car, I could be not on y=7 at τ=2.\n\nI need to be on freeway 7 only when 0 is not covered.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when it is safe to be there, i.e., when no car covers x=0.\n\nSince freeways 5,6,7,8 have identical cars, the safety condition is the same for all, but it depends on the freeway only if cars are different, but here they are same, so for any of y=5,6,7,8, the cars are the same, so the times when collision happens are the same.\n\nIs that right?\n\nFreeways 5,6,7,8 each have their own cars, but the car positions are identical, so for each, at time τ, if 0 in span of either car, then unsafe.\n\nAnd since cars are same, unsafe at same τ for all y=5,6,7,8.\n\nBut y=1,2,3,4 are different.\n\nFirst, let's find for freeways 5-8, when it is unsafe.\n\nThe two cars:\n\nCar A: [37 + 12τ, 48 + 12τ]\n\nCar B: [-35 + 12τ, -24 + 12τ]\n\n0 in car A if 37+12τ <= 0 <= 48+12τ\n\nSince 37+12τ >0 for τ>=0, because 37>0, so 0 <= 48+12τ always true for τ>=0? 48+12τ >0, but 37+12τ <=0? 37+12τ >=37>0, so 37+12τ >0, so 0 < 37+12τ <= 48+12τ, so 0 is not <= left end, since left end >0, so 0 not in [37+12τ, 48+12τ] for any τ, because min is at least 37>0.\n\nSimilarly, car B: 0 in [-35+12τ, -24+12τ] if -35+12τ <= 0 <= -24+12τ\n\nWhich is 12τ <= 35 and 0 <= -24+12τ and -35+12τ <=0\n\nBetter: 0 <= -24+12τ => 24 <= 12τ => τ >= 2\n\nAnd -35+12τ <=0 => 12τ <=35 => τ <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916\n\nSince τ integer, τ <=2 since 12*2=24<35, 12*3=36>35.\n\nτ >=2 and τ <= 35/12 ≈2.916, so τ=2 only? τ integer.\n\nτ >=2 from 0 <= -24+12τ\n\n0 <= -24 +12τ => 12τ >=24 => τ >=2\n\nAnd -35+12τ <=0 => 12τ <=35 => τ <= 2.916, so τ=2\n\nAt τ=2, -35+24 = -11 <=0, -24+24=0 <=0, so 0 in [-11,0]\n\nAt τ=3, -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nAt τ=1, -35+12= -23, -24+12= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at τ=2, car B covers 0.\n\nCar A never covers 0.\n\nSo for freeways 5-8, unsafe only at τ=2, when car B covers 0.\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nNow, for freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 has three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-16,-27,right,4), so at τ=0, span [-27,-16], at τ: [-27+4τ, -16+4τ]\n\nSecond car: (20,9,right,4), span at τ: [9+4τ, 20+4τ]\n\nThird car: (56,45,right,4), span [45+4τ, 56+4τ]\n\nNow, 0 in first car: -27+4τ <=0 <= -16+4τ\n\nWhich requires -27+4τ <=0 => 4τ <=27 => τ <= 6.75\n\nAnd 0 <= -16+4τ => 4τ >=16 => τ >=4\n\nSo τ from 4 to 6, integer τ=4,5,6.\n\nAt τ=4: [-27+16, -16+16] = [-11,0], contains 0\n\nτ=5: [-27+20, -16+20]= [-7,4], contains 0\n\nτ=6: [-27+24, -16+24]= [-3,8], contains 0\n\nτ=7: [-27+28, -16+28]= [1,12], not contain 0\n\nSimilarly, second car: [9+4τ, 20+4τ], min=9>0 at τ=0, so always positive, never contains 0.\n\nThird car: [45+4τ,56+4τ] >0 always, never contains 0.\n\nSo only first car can cover 0, at τ=4,5,6.\n\nThus freeway 4 unsafe at τ=4,5,6.\n\nNow freeways 1,2,3: all same, car with span [-35+3τ, -24+3τ]\n\n0 in this if -35+3τ <=0 <= -24+3τ\n\nSo -35+3τ <=0 => 3τ <=35 => τ <= 11.666\n\n0 <= -24+3τ => 3τ >=24 => τ >=8\n\nSo τ from 8 to 11, integer τ=8,9,10,11.\n\nAt τ=8: [-35+24, -24+24]= [-11,0], contains 0\n\nτ=9: [-35+27, -24+27]= [-8,3], contains 0\n\nτ=10: [-35+30, -24+30]= [-5,6], contains 0\n\nτ=11: [-35+33, -24+33]= [-2,9], contains 0\n\nτ=12: [-35+36, -24+36]= [1,12], not contain\n\nSo unsafe at τ=8,9,10,11.\n\nNow, I start at τ=0, y=5.\n\nI need to reach y=9 asap.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nThe freeways I need to worry about are y=5,6,7,8.\n\nBut since all have same safety, unsafe only at τ=2.\n\nAlso, when moving between, but since collision only when on the freeway at that turn, not while moving.\n\nNow, to go from y=5 to y=9, I need to be on y=6,7,8 at some points.\n\nMinimum, I need to be on y=6, y=7, y=8 at some turns, but not necessarily consecutively if I stay or move down, but that would increase time, so probably not efficient.\n\nSince unsafe only at τ=2 for y=5-8, I should avoid being on any of y=5,6,7,8 at τ=2.\n\nBecause at τ=2, if I am on any freeway 1-8, but specifically for y=5-8, it is unsafe, and for y=1-4, we have their own unsafe times, but at τ=2, let's see if y=1-4 are safe.\n\nAt τ=2:\n\nFreeway 1: span [-35+3*2, -24+3*2] = [-35+6, -24+6] = [-29,-18], not contain 0.\n\nSimilarly freeway 2,3 same, safe.\n\nFreeway 4: at τ=2, first car [-27+4*2, -16+4*2] = [-27+8, -16+8] = [-19,-8], not contain 0.\n\nSecond and third no, so safe.\n\nSo at τ=2, only freeways 5-8 are unsafe, y=1-4 are safe.\n\nBut I am starting from y=5.\n\nBack to the plan.\n\nIf I go straight up, at τ=2, I would be on y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nSo I need not to be on y=5,6,7,8 at τ=2.\n\nI can be on y=0 or y=9, but y=0 might be safe, or on freeway but not 5-8.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no collision possible there.\n\ny=0: the vertical axis, but cars are on freeways y=1 to 8, so at y=0 or y=9, no cars, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly, when on y=0 or y=9, no need to check for collision.\n\nOnly when on y=1 to 8.\n\nAt τ=2, if I am on y=0 or y=9, safe.\n\nOr on y=1-4, which at τ=2 are safe as above.\n\nNow, from start, at τ=0, y=5.\n\nI can choose to stay or move down or up.\n\nBut I want to go up.\n\nSince τ=2 is the only critical point for y=5-8, I can avoid being on those at τ=2.\n\nFor example, at τ=2, I can be on y=4 or below, or y=9, but y=9 might not be reachable by τ=2.\n\nAt τ=0, y=5.\n\nIf I go up at τ=0: to y=6 at τ=1\n\nAt τ=1, y=6\n\nIf I go up at τ=1: to y=7 at τ=2, but τ=2 y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf I go down at τ=1: from y=6, down to y=5 at τ=2, but y=5 at τ=2 unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at τ=1: from y=6, stay, y=6 at τ=2, unsafe.\n\nSo from y=6 at τ=1, whatever I do, at τ=2 I will be on y=5,6, or7 if I go up, all unsafe since y=5,6,7 are all in 5-8.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 all unsafe at τ=2.\n\nSo if I am on any of them at τ=1, and I have to take action, I will be on y=5,6,7,8 or possibly y=4 if I go down, but y=4 is freeway 4.\n\nAt τ=1, if I am on y=6, which is freeway 6, safe at τ=1 as earlier.\n\nNow, actions:\n\nIf a_1 = U: y_2 =7, on freeway 7 at τ=2, unsafe.\n\na_1 = D: y_2 =5, on freeway 5 at τ=2, unsafe.\n\na_1 = S: y_2 =6, on freeway 6 at τ=2, unsafe.\n\nAll unsafe.\n\nBut I could be not on y=6 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=0, I start at y=5.\n\nI take action a_0.\n\nOptions:\n\na_0 = U: then y_1 =6\n\nThen at τ=1, y=6, and as above, stuck for τ=2.\n\na_0 = D: then y_1 =4\n\nNow at τ=1, y=4, which is freeway 4.\n\nAt τ=1, is freeway 4 safe?\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe at τ=4,5,6, not at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, cars: first car [-27+4*1, -16+4*1] = [-23,-12], no 0\n\nSecond [9+4,20+4]=[13,24], no\n\nThird [45+4,56+4]=[49,60], no\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=4, I take action.\n\nNow I want to go up eventually.\n\nBut at τ=2, I need to be not on y=5-8.\n\nSo at τ=1, y=4, I can go up to y=5, but y=5 at τ=2 unsafe.\n\nOr stay at y=4, or go down to y=3.\n\nIf I go up to y=5 at τ=2, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at y=4 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, freeway 4: as above, at τ=2, first car [-27+8,-16+8]=[-19,-8], no 0, so safe.\n\nThen I can be on y=4 at τ=2, safe.\n\nThen after τ=2, I can go up.\n\nNow, τ=2 is past, so for τ>2, y=5-8 are safe, since only unsafe at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=3, car B: [-35+36, -24+36]= [1,12] >0, no 0.\n\nSimilarly later.\n\nSo after τ=2, all freeways 5-8 safe.\n\nNow, also freeway 4 unsafe at τ=4,5,6, but I might not be there.\n\nSo back to sequence.\n\nAt τ=0, I am at y=5.\n\nI can choose to go down to y=4 at τ=1.\n\na_0 = D, so y_1 =4\n\nAt τ=1, y=4, safe.\n\nNow at τ=1, I need to take action for τ=2.\n\nI can stay or go down or up.\n\nBut at τ=2, I want to avoid y=5-8.\n\nIf I go up, y_2=5, which is unsafe at τ=2.\n\nIf I stay, y_2=4, which is safe at τ=2 as above.\n\nIf I go down, y_2=3.\n\nFreeway 3 at τ=2: as earlier, safe.\n\nBut going down might delay.\n\nSo best to stay at y=4 at τ=2.\n\nThen after that, go up.\n\nAt τ=1, action: a_1 = S, so stay, then y_2=4\n\nAt τ=2, y=4, safe.\n\nNow at τ=2, I can go up to y=5.\n\na_2 = U, then y_3 =5\n\nAt τ=3, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nAt τ=3, is it safe? For freeway 5-8, at τ=3, car B [ -35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], no 0, car A [37+36,48+36]=[73,84], no, so safe.\n\nThen I can go up to y=6 at τ=4.\n\na_3 = U, y_4 =6\n\nAt τ=4, y=6, freeway 6, safe since τ=4>2.\n\nSimilarly, a_4 = U, y_5=7\n\nAt τ=5, y=7, safe.\n\na_5 = U, y_6=8\n\nAt τ=6, y=8, safe.\n\na_6 = U, y_7=9\n\nAt τ=7, y=9, reached.\n\nBut I reached at y_7=9, which is after 7 actions? Let's count.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=6, that's 7 actions, H=7.\n\nBut earlier I thought minimum 4, but with delay.\n\nI could go faster.\n\nFrom τ=2, y=4, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=4 to y=9, need +5, so at least 5 up actions.\n\nBut I can do multiple up.\n\nIn the above, from τ=2 y=4, I go up each turn: τ=2 y=4, a_2=U, y_3=5\n\nτ=3 y=5, a_3=U, y_4=6\n\nτ=4 y=6, a_4=U, y_5=7\n\nτ=5 y=7, a_5=U, y_6=8\n\nτ=6 y=8, a_6=U, y_7=9\n\nSo at τ=7, y=9.\n\nActions: τ=0: a_0=D to y=4? Start y=5, a_0=D, y_1=4\n\nτ=1: a_1=S, y_2=4\n\nτ=2: a_2=U, y_3=5\n\nτ=3: a_3=U, y_4=6\n\nτ=4: a_4=U, y_5=7\n\nτ=5: a_5=U, y_6=8\n\nτ=6: a_6=U, y_7=9\n\nSo H=7 actions, from τ=0 to 6.\n\nBut at τ=4,5,6, I am on y=6,7,8, which are safe, but also freeway 4 is unsafe at τ=4,5,6, but I am not on freeway 4 at those times.\n\nAt τ=4, I am on y=6, not y=4.\n\nSimilarly τ=5 y=7, τ=6 y=8.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut can I reach faster?\n\nFor example, at τ=0, instead of going down, maybe I can go up but skip τ=2.\n\nAt τ=0, y=5.\n\nIf I stay, a_0=S, then y_1=5\n\nAt τ=1, y=5, which is safe? At τ=1, freeway 5: car B [-35+12, -24+12]=[-23,-12], no 0, safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, I can go down to y=4.\n\na_1=D, y_2=4\n\nAt τ=2, y=4, safe as before.\n\nThen same as above.\n\nBut I wasted a turn staying at y=5.\n\nWorse.\n\nAt τ=0, go up to y=6 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=6, I need to not be on y=5-8 at τ=2.\n\nBut from y=6, I can only go to y=5,6,7 at τ=2, all unsafe.\n\nUnless I can be on y=4, but from y=6, down to y=5, not directly to y=4? No, each action changes by one.\n\nFrom y=6, I can go down to y=5, but y=5 at τ=2 unsafe.\n\nOr stay y=6, unsafe, or up to y=7, unsafe.\n\nNo way from y=6 at τ=1 to avoid unsafe at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, if I start by going down to y=4 at τ=1, then at τ=1 I am at y=4.\n\nThen at τ=1, instead of staying, I could go down further, but that might not help.\n\nFor example, at τ=1, y=4, go down to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=3, freeway 3.\n\nAt τ=2, freeway 3: car span [-35+3*2, -24+3*2]= [-29,-18], no 0, safe.\n\nThen I can go up from there.\n\nBut I am at y=3, need to go to y=9, which takes more actions.\n\nWorse than staying at y=4.\n\nAt τ=1, y=4, I can go up to y=5 at τ=2, but unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo the only safe way at τ=2 is to be below y=5, like y=4 or less.\n\ny=4 at τ=2 is safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut can I reach y=9 faster than τ=7?\n\nτ=7 is the turn index when y=9.\n\ny_τ at τ.\n\nIn the sequence above, y_7=9 at τ=7.\n\nBut τ=0 to τ=6 actions, H=7.\n\nSince after τ=2, all is safe, I can go up as fast as possible.\n\nFrom τ=2, y=4, to y=9, need 5 steps up.\n\ny_2=4, after k up actions, y_{2+k} =4 + k\n\nSet 4+k=9, k=5, so y_{7}=9, same as before.\n\nBut at τ=2, I have y=4.\n\nHow did I get to y=4 at τ=2.\n\nFrom start: τ=0 y=5, need to get to y=4 at τ=2.\n\nWith two actions.\n\nIf I go down at τ=0 to y=4 at τ=1, then at τ=1 I need to stay or something to be at y=4 at τ=2.\n\nIf I stay at τ=1, y=4.\n\nThen at τ=2 y=4.\n\nIf I go down further, y=3 at τ=2, but then I start from lower.\n\nBut from y=4 to y=9 is 5 steps, from y=3 would be 6 steps.\n\nWorse.\n\nAt τ=0, I stay at y=5, so y_1=5 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, I go down to y=4 at τ=2.\n\nThen y_2=4.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIn this case: τ=0: a_0=S, y_1=5\n\nτ=1: a_1=D, y_2=4\n\nThen τ=2: a_2=U, y_3=5\n\n...\n\nUp to y_7=9.\n\nBut with a_0=S, which is no move, same time as going down first.\n\nIn the first sequence, I went down at τ=0, then stay at τ=1.\n\nNow with stay then down, I have one more action? No.\n\nFirst sequence: actions τ=0: D, τ=1: S, τ=2: U, ..., τ=6: U to y_7=9. Actions at τ=0 to 6.\n\nSecond: τ=0: S, τ=1: D, τ=2: U, ..., τ=6: U, same actions, just different order, but y at τ=1 different, but both lead to y=4 at τ=2.\n\nIn first: τ=0: D, y_1=4\n\nτ=1: S, y_2=4\n\nIn second: τ=0: S, y_1=5\n\nτ=1: D, y_2=4\n\nSame y_2=4.\n\nThen same from there.\n\nSo H=7 minimum in this case?\n\nBut perhaps I can reach y=9 before τ=7.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=8 at some point and jump, but no, only one step per turn.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=2, instead of being on y=4, I could be on y=9, but impossible since from y=5 at τ=0, to y=9 in two steps? Minimum two up actions, but y_2 = y_0 + Δy_0 + Δy_1\n\nMax y_2 =5 +1 +1=7, so at τ=2, at best y=7, which is unsafe, or y=6 or5, all unsafe at τ=2.\n\nCannot be at y=9 or y=0 at τ=2 with less than 4 steps from y=5.\n\ny=0: down 5 steps, worse.\n\nSo indeed, I must be on a safe freeway at τ=2, which are y=1,2,3,4, all safe at τ=2.\n\ny=4 is the highest, so best to be at y=4 at τ=2.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9 in 5 steps.\n\nTotal turns from τ=0: to reach y=4 at τ=2, that takes 2 actions (τ=0 and τ=1), then from τ=2 to τ=6, 5 actions to reach y=9 at τ=7.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=6, 7 actions.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, from t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn this case, actions at turns τ=0,1,2,3,4,5,6, that's 7 actions, and at τ=6, I take action to go to y=9 at τ=7.\n\nAt turn τ=6, I take action a_6=U, and y_{7}=9.\n\nNow, at turn τ=6, what is y? y_6=8, since I go up to y=9.\n\ny_6=8, which is freeway 8.\n\nAt τ=6, is it safe? Freeway 8, cars: car A [37+12*6,48+12*6]=[37+72,48+72]=[109,120], no\n\nCar B [-35+72, -24+72]=[37,48], no 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut H=7, but perhaps I can save a turn by not staying.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, go down to y=4 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, instead of staying, go up? But at τ=1, y=4, if I go up, y_2=5 at τ=2, but τ=2 y=5 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo down to y=3 at τ=2, then from y=3 to y=9, need 6 up actions, reach at τ=8 or something, worse.\n\nSo H=7 seems necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can be on y=8 at τ=2 or something, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=6 at τ=1, then at τ=1, go down to y=5 at τ=2, but unsafe, or stay, unsafe, etc.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother thought: since at τ=2 only y=5-8 unsafe, I could be on y=9 at τ=2, but impossible.\n\nOr on y=0, but far.\n\nSo I think H=7 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have to specify the actions.\n\nIn the first sequence: actions:\n\nTurn t1 (τ=0): D (down)\n\nThen turn t1+1 (τ=1): S (stay)\n\nThen turn t1+2 (τ=2): U (up)\n\nThen t1+3: U\n\nt1+4: U\n\nt1+5: U\n\nt1+6: U\n\nAfter 7 actions, at turn t1+6, y_{t1+7} =9? Let's see the turns.\n\nt1 is current turn, say T= t1.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, take action a_T.\n\nThen y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T\n\nAt turn T+1, position y_{T+1}, take a_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, from a_T to a_{T+H-1}, we have y_{T+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, T = t1 =8.\n\nStart at turn 8, y=5.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{8+H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt turn 8 (τ=0), take a_8, say D, then y_9 = y_8 + (-1) =4? y_{t+1} after action at t.\n\ny_{9} =4\n\nThen at turn 9 (τ=1), take a_9=S, y_{10} =4\n\nAt turn 10 (τ=2), take a_10=U, y_{11}=5\n\nAt turn 11 (τ=3), a_11=U, y_{12}=6\n\nAt turn 12 (τ=4), a_12=U, y_{13}=7\n\nAt turn 13 (τ=5), a_13=U, y_{14}=8\n\nAt turn 14 (τ=6), a_14=U, y_{15}=9\n\nSo at turn 14, after action, y_{15}=9, so we reached at turn 15.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 8 to 14, that's 7 actions: turns 8,9,10,11,12,13,14.\n\nH=7.\n\ny_{8+H} = y_{15} =9, so H=7.\n\nBut at which turn is y=9? At turn 15.\n\nBut the player reaches (0,9) at turn T when y_T=9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 15, y=9.\n\nFrom turn 8 to 15, 7 turns later? Turn 8 to turn 9 is one turn, etc.\n\nStart turn 8, after 0 actions, y=5.\n\nAfter 1 action (at turn 8), y_9=4\n\nAfter 2 actions (turns 8,9), y_10=4\n\n...\n\nAfter 7 actions (turns 8 to 14), y_15=9.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach earlier.\n\nSince after τ=2, it is safe, and I can go up faster if I start higher.\n\nBut at τ=2, I am at y=4.\n\nIf at τ=0, I go up to y=6 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=6, I cannot stay, but I have to take action.\n\nThe only way to avoid τ=2 on unsafe y is to move to a safe y at τ=2.\n\nFrom y=6 at τ=1, possible actions:\n\n- U: to y=7 at τ=2, unsafe\n\n- D: to y=5 at τ=2, unsafe\n\n- S: to y=6 at τ=2, unsafe\n\nAll lead to unsafe at τ=2.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=6 at τ=1 if I want to avoid.\n\nSimilarly, if I am at y=5 at τ=1, I can go down to y=4 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=1, y=5 (if I stayed at τ=0), then a_1=D, y_2=4, safe at τ=2.\n\nBut I was at y=5 at τ=1, which is safe, since τ=1 not unsafe for y=5.\n\nThen go down to y=4 at τ=2.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut in this case, I have: τ=0: S, y_1=5\n\nτ=1: D, y_2=4\n\nThen τ=2: U, y_3=5\n\n...\n\nUp to y_7=9 at τ=7? y_τ at τ.\n\ny_0=5\n\ny_1=5 (after S)\n\ny_2=4 (after D)\n\ny_3=5 (after U)\n\ny_4=6\n\ny_5=7\n\ny_6=8\n\ny_7=9\n\nAt τ=7, y_7=9.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=6: a_0=S, a_1=D, a_2=U, a_3=U, a_4=U, a_5=U, a_6=U\n\nThat's 7 actions.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIn the first sequence, with down and stay, I had a_0=D, a_1=S, a_2=U, etc., also 7 actions.\n\nNow, but at τ=7, y=9, which is after 7 actions.\n\nBut is there a way with H=6?\n\nSuppose H=6 actions, then y_{8+6} = y_{14} =9.\n\ny_8=5\n\ny_{14} = y_8 + sum_{t=8}^{13} Δy_t =5 + sum =9, so sum Δy_t =4.\n\nSince each |Δy|<=1, must have exactly 4 up and 2 other actions (down or stay), but since we need to go up, down might not help, so probably 4 up and 2 stay, or something.\n\nBut with sum=4, and 6 actions, so net +4, so number of up minus number of down =4, and up + down + stay =6.\n\nLet U be number of up, D down, S stay, U + D + S =6, U - D =4.\n\nThen 2U + S =10, etc., possible, e.g., U=4, D=0, S=2; or U=5, D=1, S=0, etc.\n\nBut in any case, I need to be at y=9 at turn 14.\n\nNow, the critical point is τ=2, which is turn 10 (since t1=8, τ=0 is turn 8, τ=1 turn 9, τ=2 turn 10).\n\nAt turn 10, I must not be on y=5,6,7,8.\n\nIf I am on y=4 or below, or y=9.\n\nBut with H=6, y at turn 10: since actions from turn 8 to 13, 6 actions.\n\nAt turn 10, that is after 2 actions? Turn 8: first action, turn 9: second action, turn 10: third action? Let's index.\n\nTurn t, action a_t.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t1 + k, position y_{t1 + k}\n\nAt turn t1, y_{t1} =5\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, y_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + k -1}, y_{t1 + k}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9\n\nFor H=6, y_{8+6} = y_{14} =9\n\nAt turn 10, which is t=10, position y_{10}\n\ny_{10} depends on actions from turn 8 to 9? y_{10} is after actions at turn 8 and 9.\n\nActions: a_8 at turn 8, affects y_9\n\na_9 at turn 9, affects y_10\n\na_10 at turn 10, affects y_11, etc.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAt turn 10, y_{10}\n\nNow, y_{10} = y_8 + Δy_8 + Δy_9\n\nSince y_9 = y_8 + Δy_8, y_10 = y_9 + Δy_9 = y_8 + Δy_8 + Δy_9\n\ny_8=5\n\nSo y_{10} = 5 + Δy_8 + Δy_9\n\nΔy_8 and Δy_9 each in {-1,0,1}\n\nSo y_{10} between 3 and 7.\n\nNow, at turn 10 (τ=2), if y_{10} in {5,6,7}, it is unsafe, since y=5,6,7 are in 5-8.\n\ny_{10} could be 3,4, or 7.\n\nIf y_{10}=7, it is unsafe.\n\nIf y_{10}=5 or 6, also unsafe.\n\ny_{10}=4: then safe, since freeway 4 safe at τ=2.\n\ny_{10}=3: safe, etc.\n\nBut y_{10} =5 + Δy_8 + Δy_9\n\nTo be safe at turn 10, y_{10} must not be in {5,6,7,8}, but y=8 possible? y_{10} <=7, since max 5+1+1=7.\n\nSo y_{10} <=7, so if y_{10}=5,6,7, unsafe; only if y_{10}=4 or less, safe.\n\ny_{10} =5 + Δy_8 + Δy_9\n\nSet to 4: so Δy_8 + Δy_9 = -1\n\nOr 3: = -2, etc.\n\nFor example, if Δy_8 = -1, Δy_9 = 0, then y_{10}=5 -1 +0=4? y_{10} =5 + Δy_8 + Δy_9\n\nIf a_8=D, Δy_8=-1, then y_9=4\n\nThen if a_9=S, Δy_9=0, y_{10}=4\n\nThen safe at turn 10.\n\nThen I need to reach y_{14}=9.\n\nFrom y_{10}=4 to y_{14}=9, need +5 in 4 actions: from a_{10} to a_{13}, affecting y_{11} to y_{14}.\n\ny_{11} = y_{10} + Δy_{10}\n\ny_{12} = y_{11} + Δy_{11} = y_{10} + Δy_{10} + Δy_{11}\n\n...\n\ny_{14} = y_{10} + Δy_{10} + Δy_{11} + Δy_{12} + Δy_{13}\n\nSet y_{14}=9, y_{10}=4, so sum_{t=10}^{13} Δy_t =5\n\nBut each Δy_t <=1, so maximum increase in 4 actions is 4, to y_{14}=8, cannot reach 9.\n\ny_{10}=4, after 4 actions (a_{10}, a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}), y_{14} = y_{10} + Δy_{10} + Δy_{11} + Δy_{12} + Δy_{13}\n\nΔy_{10} to Δy_{13} each at most 1, so y_{14} <= 4 + 4*1 =8, which is less than 9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 at turn 14 with y_{10}=4.\n\nIf y_{10}=3, even worse.\n\ny_{10} must be 4 or less to be safe at turn 10, but then from there, in the remaining actions to turn 13, I can only reach up to y_{14}= y_{10} +4 <= 4+4=8 <9.\n\nIf I set y_{10} higher, but y_{10} <=7, and if y_{10}=5,6,7, it is unsafe at turn 10.\n\nFor example, if y_{10}=7, which requires Δy_8 + Δy_9 =2, so both up, a_8=U, a_9=U, then y_9=6, y_{10}=7.\n\nThen at turn 10, y=7, unsafe, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if y_{10}=6, e.g., a_8=U, a_9=S, y_9=6, y_{10}=6, unsafe.\n\na_8=S, a_9=U, y_9=5, y_{10}=6, unsafe at turn 10.\n\nIf y_{10}=5, a_8=S, a_9=S, y_{10}=5, unsafe; or a_8=D, a_9=U, y_9=4, y_{10}=5, unsafe.\n\nOnly when y_{10} <=4, safe, but then cannot reach y=9 in 4 more actions.\n\nTherefore, impossible with H=6.\n\nFor H=5, even worse.\n\nThus minimal H is 7.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to output the actions starting from turn t1=8.\n\nWith H=7.\n\nI can choose any sequence that avoids being on y=5-8 at τ=2 (turn 10).\n\nFor example:\n\nOption 1:\n\nTurn 8: D  (down to y=4 at turn 9)\n\nTurn 9: S  (stay, y=4 at turn 10)\n\nThen turn 10: U  (up to y=5 at turn 11)\n\nTurn 11: U  (to y=6 at turn 12)\n\nTurn 12: U  (to y=7 at turn 13)\n\nTurn 13: U  (to y=8 at turn 14)\n\nTurn 14: U  (to y=9 at turn 15)\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nIn the box:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H-1\n\nHere t1=8, H=7, so actions from turn 8 to turn 14.\n\na_8 to a_14.\n\nIn the sequence above: a_8=D, a_9=S, a_10=U, a_11=U, a_12=U, a_13=U, a_14=U\n\nBut at turn 14, a_14=U, to y_15=9.\n\nYes.\n\nI could have a_8=S, a_9=D, a_10=U, etc., same.\n\nBut in that case, at turn 9, y=5, which is safe, but then down.\n\nNow, but in the first way, with down and stay, I have to specify.\n\nBut in the car state, there is freeway 4, which has unsafe times, but in this sequence, I am on y=4 only at turn 9 and 10.\n\nAt turn 9: y=4, freeway 4, time τ=1 (since τ=0 at turn 8).\n\nAt τ=1, freeway 4 safe, as earlier.\n\nAt turn 10: y=4, τ=2, safe as well.\n\nThen I leave, so no issue with τ=4,5,6.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nAnother thing: when I go up through y=6,7,8 at later times, all safe since after τ=2.\n\nBut at τ=4,5,6, freeway 4 is unsafe, but I am not on it.\n\nSimilarly, y=1,2,3 unsafe at τ=8,9,10,11, but I am not there.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 7.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to write the sequence.\n\nSince the problem says \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the box, only the sequence, I think.\n\nThe answer format is just the actions.\n\nNow, to write it clearly.\n\nAlso, in the sequence, I used S for stay, U for up, D for down.\n\nIn the game dynamics, it's S, U, D.\n\nNow, but in the action, at turn t, a_t.\n\nIn the sequence above, with a_8=D, a_9=S, a_10=U, a_11=U, a_12=U, a_13=U, a_14=U\n\nBut I can start with a_8=S, a_9=D, then a_10=U, etc.\n\nBut that has a stay at turn 8, which might not be necessary, but both are H=7.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid the stay.\n\nFor example, at turn 8, go down to y=4 at turn 9.\n\nThen at turn 9, instead of stay, I have to do something, but if I go up at turn 9, y_{10}=5 at turn 10, unsafe.\n\nIf I go down to y=3 at turn 10, then from y=3, I need to go to y=9, which takes more actions.\n\nFor example: a_8=D, y_9=4\n\na_9=D, y_{10}=3\n\nThen at turn 10, y=3, freeway 3, safe at τ=2.\n\nThen a_{10}=U, y_{11}=4\n\na_{11}=U, y_{12}=5\n\na_{12}=U, y_{13}=6\n\na_{13}=U, y_{14}=7\n\na_{14}=U, y_{15}=8? y_{15}=8, not 9.\n\ny_{14}=7, a_{14}=U, y_{15}=8, but we need y_{14}? No.\n\ny_{t1 + H} = y_{8+7} = y_{15} =9.\n\nIn this: from y_{10}=3, a_{10}=U to y_{11}=4\n\na_{11}=U to y_{12}=5\n\na_{12}=U to y_{13}=6\n\na_{13}=U to y_{14}=7\n\na_{14}=U to y_{15}=8\n\ny_{15}=8, not 9. Missing one up.\n\ny_{10}=3, after a_{10} to a_{13}, 4 actions, y_{14} = y_{10} + sum_{t=10}^{13} Δy_t\n\nIf all up, y_{14}=3+4=7\n\nThen a_{14}=U, y_{15}=8, but we need y_{15}=9, so not reached.\n\nTo reach y_{15}=9, need y_{14} + Δy_{14} =9, so y_{14}=8 or 9.\n\nBut from y_{10}=3, with 4 actions to y_{14}, max y_{14}=7, so impossible to reach y_{15}=9 from here with H=7? H=7 actions, y_{15}=9.\n\nIn this sequence, after 7 actions, y_{15}=8, not 9.\n\nIf I do more up, but H=7 actions, I have only 7.\n\nFor example, from start: a_8=D, y_9=4\n\na_9=D, y_{10}=3\n\na_{10}=U, y_{11}=4\n\na_{11}=U, y_{12}=5\n\na_{12}=U, y_{13}=6\n\na_{13}=U, y_{14}=7\n\na_{14}=U, y_{15}=8\n\ny_{15}=8 <9, not reached.\n\nNeed another action, but H=7, that's all.\n\nTo reach y_{15}=9, I need y_{14} + Δy_{14} =9, so if Δy_{14}=1, y_{14}=8.\n\ny_{14} must be 8.\n\nNow, from y_{10}=3, to y_{14}=8 in 4 actions? y_{14} = y_{10} + Δy_{10} + Δy_{11} + Δy_{12} + Δy_{13}\n\ny_{10}=3, y_{14}=8, so sum Δy from t=10 to 13 must be +5, but 4 actions, max +4, impossible.\n\nTherefore, if I go down to y=3 at turn 10, I cannot reach y=9 by turn 15 with 7 actions.\n\nSimilarly, only by being at y=4 at turn 10, I can reach.\n\nWith y_{10}=4, then y_{14} = y_{10} + sum_{t=10}^{13} Δy_t\n\nSet y_{14}=8 for y_{15}=9 with up.\n\ny_{14}=8, y_{10}=4, so sum_{t=10}^{13} Δy_t =4, which is possible with all up.\n\nThen a_{14}=U to y_{15}=9.\n\nIn the sequence with stay: y_{10}=4, a_{10}=U, y_{11}=5, a_{11}=U, y_{12}=6, a_{12}=U, y_{13}=7, a_{13}=U, y_{14}=8, a_{14}=U, y_{15}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I don't stay, but I have to be at y=4 at turn 10.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll use the first sequence.\n\nBut in the output, it should be for each turn.\n\nCurrent turn t1=8.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nThe sequence of actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1} = a_8 to a_{14}\n\nWith a_8=D, a_9=S, a_10=U, a_11=U, a_12=U, a_13=U, a_14=U\n\nNow, to confirm the collision points.\n\nAt turn 8: y=5, τ=0, safe.\n\nAction D, so to y=4 at turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9: y=4, τ=1, freeway 4, safe as before.\n\nAction S, so y=4 at turn 10.\n\nAt turn 10: y=4, τ=2, freeway 4, at τ=2, safe.\n\nAction U, so to y=5 at turn 11.\n\nAt turn 11: y=5, τ=3, freeway 5, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=6 at turn 12.\n\nAt turn 12: y=6, τ=4, freeway 6, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=7 at turn 13.\n\nAt turn 13: y=7, τ=5, freeway 7, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=8 at turn 14.\n\nAt turn 14: y=8, τ=6, freeway 8, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=9 at turn 15.\n\nReached.\n\nPerfect.\n\nI could have a shorter sequence but not possible.\n\nSo minimal H=7.\n\nNow for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) is 7. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) at turn \\(t = 10\\) (relative time \\(\\tau = 2\\)), when these freeways are unsafe due to a car covering position \\(x = 0\\).\n\n- At turn \\(t = 10\\) (\\(\\tau = 2\\)), freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are unsafe because the car with initial state \\((-24, -35, \\text{right}, 12)\\) covers \\(x = 0\\) at this turn.\n- To avoid this, the player moves down to \\(y = 4\\) at turn \\(t = 9\\) and stays there until turn \\(t = 10\\), where freeway \\(y = 4\\) is safe at \\(\\tau = 2\\).\n- After turn \\(t = 10\\), all freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are safe, allowing the player to move up directly to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- **Turn 8**: Action \\(D\\) (move down) to reach \\(y = 4\\) at turn 9.\n- **Turn 9**: Action \\(S\\) (stay) to remain at \\(y = 4\\) at turn 10, avoiding collision.\n- **Turn 10**: Action \\(U\\) (move up) to reach \\(y = 5\\) at turn 11.\n- **Turn 11**: Action \\(U\\) (move up) to reach \\(y = 6\\) at turn 12.\n- **Turn 12**: Action \\(U\\) (move up) to reach \\(y = 7\\) at turn 13.\n- **Turn 13**: Action \\(U\\) (move up) to reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 14.\n- **Turn 14**: Action \\(U\\) (move up) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 15.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 15 after 7 actions, starting from turn 8. No shorter sequence is possible, as \\(H = 6\\) would either result in a collision at turn 10 or fail to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 14.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 8: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U }",

For right-moving cars, the span moves right as time increases, and for left-moving, it moves left.\n\nThe collision happens only if at turn T, when I'm at position (0, y_T), and for the freeway y_T, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, when I move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, I'm not on y_{T+1} until the next turn, so I only care about the freeway I'm currently on for collision.\n\nThe player position update is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t being +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, looking at the car states:\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, (-48,-59, right, 3). Since it's right-moving, the span moves right with speed 3.\n\nAt turn t, the position is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)] for right-moving? Let's see the update:\n\nIt says for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For freeway 1: head=-48, tail=-59, direction=right, speed=3.\n\nBut in the span, for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head? But here head is -48, tail is -59, so τ = -59, h = -48.\n\nSince it's right-moving, head should be greater than tail? -48 > -59, yes, so span is from tail to head: [τ, h] = [-59, -48].\n\nThen at time T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-59 + 3(T-10), -48 + 3(T-10)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision if at turn T, when I'm on freeway k, 0 is in Span(T) for any car on that freeway.\n\nMeaning for freeway k, at turn T, there is a car whose span contains 0.\n\nIf 0 is not in any span for freeway k at turn T, I'm safe on that freeway at that turn.\n\nNow, since I start at y=0 at turn t1=10, and I need to go to y=9, I have to move up through y=1 to y=8, and end at y=9.\n\nEach move U increases y by 1, D decreases, S stays.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should move up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the freeways when cars are at x=0.\n\nAlso, I can stay or move down if needed, but since I need to go up, moving down might waste turns, so probably not unless necessary.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, at which turns the car is at x=0, meaning 0 is in the span.\n\nLet t be the turn number relative to t1=10. So at turn T, time since t1 is T - 10.\n\nSet τ = T - t1, so at time τ after t1.\n\nThen for each car, Span at turn T = t1 + τ is:\n\nFor right-moving car: [τ + s τ, h + s τ] where τ is tail at t1, h is head at t1.\n\ns is speed.\n\nτ = T - t1.\n\nSo Span(T) = [tail + s (T - t1), head + s (T - t1)] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving, I think. Let me check.\n\nFreeway 1: direction right\n\nFreeway 2: right\n\n3: right\n\n4: all right\n\n5: right\n\n6: right\n\n7: right\n\n8: right\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so only that formula.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need when 0 is in the span for some car on that freeway.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway k, at turn T, if there exists a car such that min(Span) ≤ 0 ≤ max(Span), since span is [low, high] for right-moving? Let's see.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(T) = [tail + s(T-t1), head + s(T-t1)]\n\nSince tail < head, it's [low, high] with low = tail + s(T-t1), high = head + s(T-t1)\n\nSo 0 is in span if low ≤ 0 ≤ high.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all right.\n\nSo for each car, the times when it occupies x=0.\n\n0 is occupied when tail + s(T-t1) ≤ 0 ≤ head + s(T-t1)\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\ntail + s τ ≤ 0 ≤ head + s τ, where τ = T - t1\n\nSo -head / s ≤ τ ≤ -tail / s? Let's solve.\n\nFrom tail + s τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ head + s τ\n\nFirst inequality: s τ ≤ -tail ⇒ τ ≤ -tail / s\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ head + s τ ⇒ s τ ≥ -head ⇒ τ ≥ -head / s\n\nSince s > 0.\n\nSo τ ≥ -head / s and τ ≤ -tail / s\n\nThen since tail < head, -tail/s > -head/s, so τ from ceil(-head/s) to floor(-tail/s)? τ is integer, T integer.\n\nτ must satisfy:\n\nmax( ceil(-head/s) , something ) to min( floor(-tail/s), something) but need to think in terms of integer turns.\n\nThe car occupies x=0 when τ is such that -head/s ≤ τ ≤ -tail/s\n\nThen since τ must be integer, the turns when it occupies are from ceil(-head/s) to floor(-tail/s)? Let's see.\n\nτ min = ceil( -head / s )\n\nτ max = floor( -tail / s )\n\nBecause:\n\nτ ≥ -head / s, so smallest integer τ is ceil(-head/s)\n\nτ ≤ -tail / s, so largest integer τ is floor(-tail/s)\n\nAnd if ceil(-head/s) ≤ floor(-tail/s), then it occupies for τ from ceil(-head/s) to floor(-tail/s) inclusive.\n\nOtherwise, not occupied.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need the set of τ where at least one car has x=0 occupied.\n\nThen, when I am on that freeway at turn T = t1 + τ, I will collide if x=0 is occupied at that turn.\n\nNow, t1=10, but τ = T - 10, so for turn T, τ = T-10.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: only one car, head=-48, tail=-59, speed=3, direction right.\n\ns=3\n\nτ min = ceil( -(-48)/3 ) = ceil(48/3) = ceil(16) =16\n\nτ max = floor( -(-59)/3 ) = floor(59/3) = floor(19.666) =19\n\nSo occupies τ=16 to 19 inclusive.\n\nτ from 16 to 19.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-48,-59,right,3), identical, so same, τ=16 to 19.\n\nFreeway 3: also same, τ=16 to 19.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4)\n\ns=4\n\nτ min = ceil( -(-48)/4 ) = ceil(48/4) = ceil(12) =12\n\nτ max = floor( -(-59)/4 ) = floor(59/4) = floor(14.75) =14\n\nSo τ=12,13,14\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,4)\n\ns=4\n\nτ min = ceil( -(-12)/4 ) = ceil(12/4) = ceil(3) =3\n\nτ max = floor( -(-23)/4 ) = floor(23/4) = floor(5.75) =5\n\nSo τ=3,4,5\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,4) head=24, tail=13? But tail should be less than head? 13 to 24, but direction right, so [13,24] at t1.\n\nIn the table: (24,13,right,4), so head=24, tail=13.\n\nThen τ min = ceil( -head/s ) = ceil(-24/4) = ceil(-6) = -6\n\nτ max = floor( -tail/s ) = floor(-13/4) = floor(-3.25) = -4? Let's compute.\n\nτ min = ceil( -head/s ) = ceil( -24 / 4 ) = ceil(-6) = -6\n\nτ max = floor( -tail/s ) = floor( -13 / 4 ) = floor(-3.25) = -4? -3.25, floor is -4? Floor is greatest integer less than or equal, so floor(-3.25) = -4\n\nBut τ min = -6, τ max = -4, so τ from -6 to -4 inclusive.\n\nBut τ = T - t1 = T - 10, so for T=10, τ=0, which is after -4, so not occupied at τ=0 or later.\n\nSimilarly, τ min = -6, τ max = -4, so at τ=-6,-5,-4, which are turns T=4,5,6, before t1=10, so not relevant for future turns.\n\nFor freeway 4, the dangerous times are from the cars that have τ in the future.\n\nFirst car: τ=12,13,14\n\nSecond car: τ=3,4,5\n\nThird car: τ=-6,-5,-4, all past, so ignore.\n\nSo freeway 4 occupied at τ=3,4,5 and τ=12,13,14\n\nτ=3,4,5 and 12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12)\n\ns=12\n\nτ min = ceil( -(-48)/12 ) = ceil(48/12) = ceil(4) =4\n\nτ max = floor( -(-59)/12 ) = floor(59/12) = floor(4.916) =4\n\nSo τ=4 only? Since min and max both 4.\n\nτ min= ceil(48/12)=ceil(4)=4\n\nτ max= floor(59/12)=floor(4.916)=4\n\nSo only at τ=4.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12)\n\nhead=0, tail=-11\n\ns=12\n\nτ min = ceil( -head/s ) = ceil( -0 / 12 ) = ceil(0) =0\n\nτ max = floor( -tail/s ) = floor( -(-11)/12 ) = floor(11/12) = floor(0.916) =0\n\nSo τ=0 only.\n\nAt τ=0, which is turn T=t1=10.\n\nNow, for freeway 5, occupied at τ=0 and τ=4.\n\nτ=0: from second car, and τ=4 from first car.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5? (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nIdentical, so occupied at τ=0 and τ=4.\n\nFreeway 7: same, (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12), so τ=0 and τ=4.\n\nFreeway 8: same, τ=0 and τ=4.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway the dangerous τ (when x=0 occupied):\n\ny=1: τ=16,17,18,19\n\ny=2: τ=16,17,18,19\n\ny=3: τ=16,17,18,19\n\ny=4: τ=3,4,5 and 12,13,14\n\ny=5: τ=0 and 4\n\ny=6: τ=0 and 4\n\ny=7: τ=0 and 4\n\ny=8: τ=0 and 4\n\nτ is relative to t1=10, so absolute turn T = t1 + τ = 10 + τ.\n\nBut we'll work with τ for simplicity.\n\nI start at y=0 at τ=0 (turn T=10).\n\nAt τ=0, I am on y=0, which has no freeway? Freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since no cars.\n\nThe problem says: avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, always safe.\n\nI start at (0,0) at turn t1=10, which is y=0, safe.\n\nI need to reach (0,9), which is also safe.\n\nThe path is through y=1 to y=8.\n\nAt each turn, I choose action U, D, S, which changes y for the next turn.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, and I choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t, I might be on freeway y_t, and I need to check if at that turn, for freeway y_t, x=0 is occupied.\n\nIf yes, collision; if no, safe.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn t, I am on y_t, and I go to y_{t+1}, but at turn t, I am not on y_{t+1}, so only care about current freeway.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, each S stays, D decreases.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should use U as much as possible, but avoid freeways when they are occupied at x=0.\n\nSince I start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns is at least 9, since I need to increase y by 9, each U increases by 1, so with only U, it takes 9 turns: from τ=0 to τ=8, y from 0 to 8, then at τ=9, y=9? Let's see.\n\nAt τ=0, turn T=10, y=0.\n\nAfter action, y_{τ} for τ=0,1,2,...\n\nDefine the state.\n\nLet y_τ be the y-position at turn T = t1 + τ.\n\nSo at τ=0, y=0.\n\nI choose action a_{t1 + τ} at turn T= t1 + τ, which affects y_{τ+1}, since y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nt is absolute turn.\n\nSet: at time τ (after t1), the turn is t1 + τ.\n\nAt that turn, I am at position y_τ.\n\nI choose action a_τ, which determines Δy, so y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy.\n\nThen, at turn τ, I am on freeway y_τ (if y_τ between 1 and 8), and I need that for freeway y_τ, at time τ, x=0 is not occupied.\n\nIf y_τ =0 or 9, no freeway, always safe.\n\nI start at τ=0, y_0 =0, safe.\n\nI need to reach some τ where y_τ =9.\n\nSince y_τ =9, and it's safe, I can stop when y_τ =9 for some τ.\n\nThe sequence of actions until I reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H actions, I am at y=9.\n\nLet’s say I take actions from τ=0 to τ=H-1, and y_H =9.\n\nAt τ=0, y_0=0.\n\nAfter a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\nGenerally, y_k = y_0 + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} Δy_i\n\ny_0 =0, so y_k = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} Δy_i\n\nEach Δy_i is -1,0,1.\n\nI need y_k =9 for some k.\n\nThe number of U actions minus number of D actions must be 9, since net +9.\n\nLet U be number of Up, D number of Down, S number of Stay.\n\nThen U - D =9, and total turns H = U + D + S.\n\nTo minimize H, I should minimize D and S, so ideally U=9, D=0, S=0, H=9.\n\nBut I might need to wait or move down to avoid occupied times.\n\nFirst, let's see if I can go straight up in 9 turns.\n\nThat means from τ=0 to τ=8, I go to y=1 to y=8 at some points.\n\nSpecifically, if I always go U, then:\n\nAt τ=0: y=0, action a_0=U, then y_1=1\n\nAt τ=1: y=1, action a_1=U, then y_2=2\n\n...\n\nAt τ=8: y=8, action a_8=U, then y_9=9\n\nNow, when I am at y=1 to y=8, I need to be safe at those turns.\n\nAt τ=0: y=0, safe, no freeway.\n\nAfter action U, at τ=1, y=1.\n\nAt τ=1, I am on y=1, need to check if freeway 1 is occupied at τ=1.\n\nFor y=1, dangerous τ: 16,17,18,19\n\nτ=1 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=1, y=1, safe.\n\nThen action U, to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=2, freeway 2 occupied at τ=16-19, not 2, safe.\n\nAction U to y=3 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=3, freeway 3 occupied at τ=16-19, not 3, safe.\n\nAction U to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 occupied at τ=3,4,5 and 12,13,14.\n\nτ=4 is occupied, since 4 in {3,4,5}.\n\nAt τ=4, on y=4, occupied, collision.\n\nSo cannot be on y=4 at τ=4.\n\nTherefore, straight up at τ=4 causes collision.\n\nNeed to avoid that.\n\nAt τ=3, if I am on y=3, but if I don't move up, I could stay or move down.\n\nBut let's list the dangerous times for each y.\n\ny=1: dangerous τ: 16-19\n\ny=2: 16-19\n\ny=3: 16-19\n\ny=4: 3,4,5 and 12,13,14\n\ny=5: τ=0 and 4\n\ny=6: τ=0 and 4\n\ny=7: τ=0 and 4\n\ny=8: τ=0 and 4\n\nAlso, y=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nNow, for y=5,6,7,8, they are dangerous at τ=0 and τ=4.\n\nτ=0 is now, at turn T=10, but at τ=0, I am at y=0, not on freeway, so when would I be on y=5 at τ=0? Only if I were already there, but I start at y=0, so at τ=0, I am on y=0, safe.\n\nThe dangerous τ are for when I am on that freeway at that τ.\n\nFor example, if I am on y=5 at τ=0, collision, but at τ=0, I am on y=0, not y=5.\n\nSimilarly, for τ=4, if I am on y=5 at τ=4, collision.\n\nBut I might not be on y=5 at τ=4.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI need to be on each y from 1 to 8 at some τ where it is not occupied.\n\nAlso, since I move one step at a time, the sequence of y positions.\n\nTo go from y=0 to y=9, I need to visit y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 in some order, but since I can only change by 1 each step, I will visit them in sequence, but I might stay or go back, so the path might have plateaus or downs, but to minimize time, I should go up as much as possible.\n\nThe critical points are where the freeways are occupied at certain times.\n\nNow, for y=4, it is occupied at τ=3,4,5 and 12,13,14.\n\nSo I should not be on y=4 at τ=3,4,5 or 12,13,14.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5, occupied at τ=0 and τ=4.\n\nBut τ=0 is past or current, but at τ=0 I am at y=0, so for y=5, dangerous at τ=4 only? τ=0 and τ=4, but τ=0 is turn 10, and I am not on y=5 then, so only τ=4 matters for future.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8, dangerous at τ=4.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 all dangerous at τ=4.\n\nAlso at τ=0, but not relevant.\n\nNow for y=1,2,3, dangerous at τ=16-19, which is later.\n\nBut τ=16 is far, so I can go to y=1,2,3 early before τ=16.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 has dangerous at τ=3,4,5 and 12,13,14.\n\nτ=3,4,5 is early, τ=12-14 later.\n\nNow, since I start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe first obstacle is at y=4 and τ=4, but also y=5,6,7,8 at τ=4.\n\nBut let's plan the path.\n\nI can go up to y=3 quickly, but avoid y=4 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=0: y=0, I can choose U to go to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nOr S to stay at y=0, or D to y=0? y=0, D would go to y=-1, but y must be in [0,9], so at y=0, D not allowed? The player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so at y=0, if I choose D, y_{t+1} = -1, which is invalid, so I cannot choose D when at y=0. Similarly, at y=9, cannot choose U.\n\nSo actions are constrained: at y=0, only U or S; at y=9, only D or S; else all actions.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0, I can choose U or S.\n\nIf I choose U, to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, which is safe since τ=1 not dangerous for y=1.\n\nThen I can choose U to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=2, safe, τ=2 not in 16-19.\n\nU to y=3 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=3, safe.\n\nNow at τ=3, I am at y=3.\n\nI need to go to y=4, but at τ=3, if I go U, I will be at y=4 at τ=4? Let's see.\n\nAt τ=3, y=3, I choose action.\n\nIf I choose U, then y_4 =4 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=4, and freeway 4 is occupied at τ=4, so collision.\n\nIf I choose S, I stay at y=3 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=3, freeway 3 is dangerous at τ=16-19, not 4, so safe.\n\nThen I can choose U later to y=4 when safe.\n\nBut y=4 is occupied at τ=3,4,5, so at τ=4, it is occupied, but at τ=4, if I am on y=3, not y=4, so safe.\n\nI need to be on y=4 only when not occupied.\n\nOccupied τ=3,4,5 and 12,13,14.\n\nSo safe times for y=4 are τ <=2 or τ=6 to 11 or τ>=15, etc.\n\nSimilarly, for other y.\n\nBut also, at τ=4, y=5,6,7,8 are all occupied, so I should not be on those at τ=4.\n\nNow, at τ=3, I am at y=3.\n\nOptions:\n\n- If U, go to y=4 at τ=4, but collision at τ=4 on y=4.\n\n- If S, stay at y=3 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=3 is safe, since y=3 dangerous only at 16-19.\n\n- If D, go down to y=2 at τ=4.\n\nBut y=2 at τ=4 is safe.\n\nBut going down might waste time.\n\nSo probably stay or go up later.\n\nSince y=4 is occupied at τ=4, I can go to y=4 at another time.\n\nFor example, at τ=6, y=4 is safe, since occupied at 3,4,5 and 12,13,14, so τ=6 not in.\n\nSimilarly, τ=2, but τ=2 is before, I was at y=2 at τ=2, could have gone to y=3 at τ=3, but I did.\n\nI am at τ=3, y=3.\n\nIf I stay at y=3 at τ=4 (by choosing S at τ=3).\n\nThen at τ=4, y=3, safe.\n\nNow at τ=4, I can choose to go U to y=4 at τ=5? y_{τ+1} at τ+1.\n\nAt τ=4, y=3, I choose action a_4.\n\nIf U, then y_5 =4 at τ=5.\n\nBut at τ=5, y=4 is occupied, since τ=5 in {3,4,5}, so collision at τ=5.\n\nIf S, stay at y=3 at τ=5.\n\ny=3 at τ=5 is safe.\n\nThen later go to y=4.\n\nIf D, go to y=2 at τ=5.\n\nBut y=2 safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to go up eventually.\n\nThe next safe time for y=4 after τ=5 is τ=6, since occupied until τ=5, then safe from τ=6 to τ=11, then occupied again at 12,13,14.\n\nτ=6,7,8,9,10,11 safe for y=4.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5, dangerous only at τ=4, so safe except τ=4.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8, dangerous only at τ=4.\n\ny=1,2,3 dangerous only at τ=16-19, which is late, so I can be on them early.\n\nSo, back to point: at τ=3, y=3, if I stay, at τ=4 y=3, safe.\n\nThen at τ=4, I am at y=3.\n\nI want to go to y=4, but if I go U at τ=4, y_5=4 at τ=5, but τ=5 y=4 occupied.\n\nIf I go S, stay y=3.\n\nThen at τ=5, y=3, I can go U to y=4 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, y=4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to y=4 at τ=6.\n\nBut that means I waste some turns.\n\nFrom τ=0 to τ=3, I went from y=0 to y=3 in 3 steps (τ=1,2,3 at y=1,2,3).\n\nAt τ=3, y=3.\n\nIf I stay at τ=3, then at τ=4, y=3.\n\nThen at τ=4, I stay or something.\n\nTo reach y=4 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=4, y=3, I choose S, so at τ=5, y=3.\n\nThen at τ=5, y=3, choose U, so at τ=6, y=4.\n\nThen at τ=6, y=4, safe.\n\nThen I can go up to y=5.\n\nBut y=5 is dangerous only at τ=4, which is past, so always safe now.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=5,6,7,8 are dangerous, but I won't be there at τ=4 if I delay.\n\nNow, at τ=6, y=4, safe.\n\nI can go U to y=5 at τ=7.\n\nAt τ=7, y=5, which is safe, since only dangerous at τ=4, past.\n\nSimilarly, U to y=6 at τ=8.\n\nAt τ=8, y=6, safe.\n\nU to y=7 at τ=9.\n\nAt τ=9, y=7, safe.\n\nU to y=8 at τ=10.\n\nAt τ=10, y=8, now freeway 8 dangerous at τ=4, but τ=10 not 4, so safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at τ=11.\n\nAt τ=11, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, how many turns? From τ=0 to τ=11, that's 12 turns? τ from 0 to 11, that's 12 steps, but y from 0 to 9.\n\nList the turns:\n\nτ=0: y=0, start\n\nAction a_0: U, to y=1 at τ=1\n\nτ=1: y=1, action U, to y=2 at τ=2\n\nτ=2: y=2, action U, to y=3 at τ=3\n\nτ=3: y=3, action S (stay), so y=3 at τ=4\n\nτ=4: y=3, action S (stay), so y=3 at τ=5? At τ=4, y=3, choose action.\n\nIf S, then y_5 = y_4 + 0 =3, so at τ=5, y=3\n\nThen at τ=5, y=3, action U, to y=4 at τ=6\n\nτ=6: y=4, action U, to y=5 at τ=7\n\nτ=7: y=5, action U, to y=6 at τ=8\n\nτ=8: y=6, action U, to y=7 at τ=9\n\nτ=9: y=7, action U, to y=8 at τ=10\n\nτ=10: y=8, action U, to y=9 at τ=11\n\nAt τ=11, y=9, done.\n\nActions: from τ=0 to τ=10, I took actions, and at τ=11, I am at y=9, so I took 11 actions? τ=0 to τ=10 inclusive is 11 actions? Let's index.\n\nI take actions at turns τ=0,1,2,...,10, that's 11 actions, and after that, at τ=11, y=9.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9, which is at τ=11.\n\nThe number of turns H: I start at τ=0, after H actions, at y_H.\n\ny_0=0, after H actions, y_H =9.\n\nEach action corresponds to a turn.\n\nSequence of actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, and after that, position is (0,9).\n\nIn terms of τ, actions a_τ for τ=0 to H-1, and y_H =9.\n\nHere, with above, if I go to y=9 at τ=11, then H=11 actions: from τ=0 to τ=10.\n\nBut I can do better? Because I wasted some time staying.\n\nIn the above, I stayed at y=3 for two extra turns: at τ=4 and τ=5, I was at y=3, but I could have gone to y=4 earlier if possible.\n\nBut y=4 not safe at τ=4 or 5.\n\nAt τ=2, I was at y=2, could I go to y=3 at τ=3, then instead of staying, go to y=4 at τ=4? But τ=4 y=4 occupied.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster through other lanes.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5,6,7,8 are only dangerous at τ=4, I can be on them before or after τ=4.\n\nBut τ=4 is early, so before might be difficult since I start from y=0.\n\nFor example, to be on y=5 before τ=4, but τ=0 I am at y=0, to reach y=5, I need at least 5 steps, but τ=4 is only 4 turns later, at τ=4, I can be at y=4 max if I go up all the way, but at τ=4, if on y=4, occupied, or if on y=5, occupied.\n\nAt τ=4, y=5 is occupied, so I cannot be on y=5 at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y=4 at τ=4.\n\nBut I can be on lower y.\n\nAt τ=3, I am at y=3, which is safe.\n\nThen at τ=4, I could go down to y=2, but that seems worse.\n\nOr stay.\n\nBut to save time, perhaps I can reach y=4 at τ=2 or something, but how?\n\nAt τ=0, y=0, go U to y=1 at τ=1\n\nτ=1, y=1, go U to y=2 at τ=2\n\nAt τ=2, y=2, now I can go U to y=3 at τ=3, or S, or D.\n\nIf U, to y=3 at τ=3.\n\nBut at τ=3, I can choose to go to y=4 at τ=4, but occupied, or not.\n\nBut I have to be on y=4 at some safe time.\n\nThe safe times for y=4 are τ <=2 or τ=6 to 11 or τ>=15.\n\nτ<=2: at τ=2, I am at y=2, if I go U at τ=2, I go to y=3 at τ=3, not to y=4.\n\nTo be at y=4 at τ=2, I need to have reached y=4 by τ=2.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0, after two actions, at τ=2, y=2 max if UU, so y=2 at τ=2, cannot be at y=4.\n\nSimilarly, earliest to be at y=4 is at τ=4, if I go UUU from τ=0: τ=0 U to y=1, τ=1 U to y=2, τ=2 U to y=3, τ=3 U to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, occupied.\n\nNext possible is τ=6, as I had.\n\nBut at τ=6, I can be at y=4.\n\nIn my earlier path, I reached y=4 at τ=6.\n\nBut I used two S actions to wait.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=5 directly or something, but I have to go through each y.\n\nAnother thought: since at τ=4, y=5,6,7,8 are occupied, but I can be on them at other times.\n\nFor example, if I can reach y=5 before τ=4, but I start at y=0, to reach y=5 at τ=3: that requires three U actions: τ=0 U to y=1, τ=1 U to y=2, τ=2 U to y=3, then at τ=3, y=3, I need to be at y=5 at τ=3? But at τ=3, I am at y=3, to be at y=5 at τ=3, I must have been there earlier, but I started at y=0, so impossible to be at y=5 before τ=4 or later.\n\nEarliest at y=5 is τ=4, but occupied.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=5, I can be at y=5, if I go from y=4 at τ=4, but y=4 occupied at τ=4, so I cannot be on y=4 at τ=4 to go to y=5.\n\nThe only way to be on y=5 is to come from y=4 or y=6.\n\nBut at safe times.\n\nFor y=5, safe except τ=4.\n\nSo I can be on y=5 at τ=3? But to be on y=5 at τ=3, I need to have reached y=5 by τ=3.\n\nWith three actions: τ=0 U to y=1, τ=1 U to y=2, τ=2 U to y=3, at τ=3 y=3, not y=5.\n\nCannot.\n\nAt τ=4, if I could be on y=5, but occupied.\n\nAt τ=5, I can be on y=5, if I was on y=4 at τ=4 and go U, but y=4 occupied at τ=4.\n\nIf I was on y=6 at τ=4 and go D, but y=6 occupied at τ=4.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo the earliest I can be on y=5 is after τ=4, say τ=5.\n\nBut to be on y=5 at τ=5, I need to have y_5=5.\n\ny_5 depends on previous.\n\nFor example, if at τ=4, I am at y=4, and go U, y_5=5.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=4 occupied, cannot.\n\nIf at τ=4, I am at y=5, but occupied, and if I go S or D, but occupied.\n\nCannot be on y=5 at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=5, if I am at y=5, it must be that I came from y=4 or y=6 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=4 and y=6 are both occupied (y=4 occupied, y=6 occupied at τ=4), so I cannot be on y=4 or y=6 at τ=4 to move to y=5 at τ=5.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be on y=5 at τ=5.\n\nSimilarly, for any y from 4 to 8 at τ=4, occupied, so I cannot be on those freeways at τ=4.\n\nBut for y=5, I can be on it at other times, like τ=3 or τ=5, but as above, impossible at τ=3 or τ=5.\n\nτ=3: to be at y=5 at τ=3, need at least 5 steps from start, but τ=3 is only 3 turns after start, so y<=3, cannot be y=5.\n\nSimilarly, τ=5: to be at y=5 at τ=5, I need to have taken 5 actions with net +5, so all U, but to be at y=5 at τ=5, I must have been at y=4 at τ=4 and go U, but y=4 occupied at τ=4, cannot.\n\nIf I go faster, but I can only increase one per turn, so maximum y at τ=4 is 4, at τ=5 is 5, etc.\n\nSo at τ=5, y=5 only possible if from y=4 at τ=4 with U, but y=4 occupied, so impossible.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at τ=6 only from y=5 or y=7 at τ=5, but y=5 cannot be at τ=5, etc.\n\nBut I don't need to be at high y early.\n\nIn fact, for y=5, since dangerous only at τ=4, I can be on it at τ=1,2,3, but impossible, or at τ=5,6,... but as above, τ=5 impossible, τ=6 possible.\n\nFor example, at τ=6, I can be on y=5.\n\nHow? If at τ=5, I am at y=4 or y=6, and move to y=5.\n\nBut at τ=5, y=4 is occupied? Freeway 4 occupied at τ=5, since τ=5 in {3,4,5}, so at τ=5, y=4 occupied, cannot be on it.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at τ=5: freeway 6 dangerous at τ=4, but not at τ=5, so y=6 safe at τ=5.\n\nIf I am on y=6 at τ=5, safe, then I can go to y=5.\n\nBut to be on y=6 at τ=5, I need to have reached there.\n\nSimilarly, let's list safe times for each y.\n\ny=1: safe except τ=16,17,18,19\n\ny=2: same\n\ny=3: same\n\ny=4: safe except τ=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=5: safe except τ=4\n\ny=6: safe except τ=4\n\ny=7: same\n\ny=8: same\n\nNow, at τ=4, all y=4,5,6,7,8 are occupied, so I must not be on any of them at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=3, y=4 occupied, but y=5,6,7,8 are safe at τ=3, but I can't be on them because I'm at lower y.\n\nAt τ=3, I can be at most y=3.\n\nAt τ=5, y=4 occupied, but y=5,6,7,8 safe.\n\nBut to be on y=5 at τ=5, I need to come from y=4 or y=6.\n\nBut y=4 occupied at τ=5, so cannot come from y=4.\n\nIf from y=6, but to be on y=6 at τ=5, I need to have been at y=6 at τ=4 or from y=5 or y=7.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=6 occupied, cannot be on it.\n\nSo cannot be on y=6 at τ=5 either.\n\nSimilarly, for any y from 4 to 8 at τ=5, it is impossible because to be on them, I must have been on adjacent y at τ=4, but all y=4,5,6,7,8 are occupied at τ=4, so no way to be on them at τ=5.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- To be on y=4 at τ=5: must have been on y=4 at τ=4 and S, or on y=3 at τ=4 and U, or on y=5 at τ=4 and D.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=4 occupied, y=5 occupied, y=3 is safe, so possible from y=3 U to y=4 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=4, if I am on y=3, safe, and I choose U, then at τ=5, y=4.\n\nBut at τ=5, y=4 is occupied, since τ=5 in dangerous for y=4, so collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot go to y=4 at τ=5.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=5 at τ=5: must come from y=4 at τ=4 U or y=5 S or y=6 D, but all occupied at τ=4, impossible.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8 at τ=5: must come from occupied y at τ=4, impossible.\n\nTherefore, at τ=5, I cannot be on any of y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=3, I can only be up to y=3.\n\nNow at τ=6, I can be on y=4, for example.\n\nAt τ=6, y=4 is safe.\n\nHow to get there.\n\nAt τ=4, I can be on y=3 or lower.\n\nFor example, at τ=4, if I am on y=3, safe.\n\nThen at τ=4, I choose U, go to y=4 at τ=5, but at τ=5, y=4 occupied, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nChoose S, stay at y=3 at τ=5.\n\nThen at τ=5, y=3, choose U, go to y=4 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, y=4 safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nAs in my initial plan.\n\nAt τ=6, y=4, U to y=5 at τ=7, etc.\n\nBut at τ=7, y=5, safe.\n\ny=5 safe except τ=4.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, what about the later dangerous times, like for y=4 at τ=12,13,14, but τ=12 is later, and I can be past y=4 by then.\n\nIn the above path, I reach y=9 at τ=11, before τ=12.\n\nSimilarly, for y=1,2,3 at τ=16-19, but I am already past.\n\nSo in the path I have, with two waits, H=11 turns.\n\nBut can I reduce the waiting?\n\nFor example, at τ=3, y=3, instead of staying, I could go down to y=2 at τ=4, but then I have to go up again, which takes more time.\n\nFor example: τ=3, y=3, choose D, to y=2 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at τ=4, I can go U to y=3 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, y=3, safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 at τ=6.\n\nSame as before, but I used a D and a U instead of two S, so net same, but I moved down and up, which might not save time.\n\nIn terms of turns, to reach y=4 at τ=6, I can do it with S or with D and U, but both take two extra actions compared to direct.\n\nDirect to y=4 at τ=4 not possible.\n\nMinimal to y=4 is at τ=6 with two waits.\n\nBut I could go to y=4 at τ=2, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5 is only dangerous at τ=4, I can be on y=5 at other times, but I need to reach it.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=5 at τ=6.\n\nThen from y=4 at τ=6, U to y=5 at τ=7.\n\nBut same as before.\n\nPerhaps I can skip some levels or something, but no, I have to go through each.\n\nOr, since at τ=4, I must be on y<=3, and at τ=5, I can be on y=3 or y=4 but y=4 occupied, so only y=3 or lower.\n\nIn the path, at τ=5, I am at y=3, then to y=4 at τ=6.\n\nNow, after that, I go up continuously to y=9 at τ=11.\n\nBut y=8 to y=9 at τ=11.\n\nNow, is there a way to save one turn?\n\nFor example, if I can reach y=4 earlier than τ=6.\n\nBut I can't.\n\nAt τ=6, y=4, but I could have been at higher y if I didn't wait, but I had to wait.\n\nAnother thought: at τ=1, y=1, I could stay or something, but that would delay more.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 or y=1, I get to y=3 later, but still have to wait for y=4.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=3 quickly, then since y=4 is safe at τ=6, but between, I need to fill time.\n\nBut I have to be somewhere.\n\nThe minimal H is 11, I think.\n\nBut let's confirm with actions.\n\nStart at τ=0, T=10, y=0\n\nAction a_{10} = U, so y=1 at τ=1, T=11\n\nAt τ=1, T=11, y=1, action a_{11} = U, y=2 at τ=2, T=12\n\nAt τ=2, T=12, y=2, action a_{12} = U, y=3 at τ=3, T=13\n\nAt τ=3, T=13, y=3, now I need to avoid being on y=4 at τ=4 or τ=5.\n\nSo at this turn, I choose action S (stay), so y=3 at τ=4, T=14\n\nAt τ=4, T=14, y=3, action S (stay), so y=3 at τ=5, T=15\n\nAt τ=5, T=15, y=3, action U, so y=4 at τ=6, T=16\n\nAt τ=6, T=16, y=4, action U, so y=5 at τ=7, T=17\n\nAt τ=7, T=17, y=5, action U, y=6 at τ=8, T=18\n\nAt τ=8, T=18, y=6, action U, y=7 at τ=9, T=19\n\nAt τ=9, T=19, y=7, action U, y=8 at τ=10, T=20\n\nAt τ=10, T=20, y=8, action U, y=9 at τ=11, T=21\n\nNow at τ=11, T=21, y=9, done.\n\nNumber of actions: from a_{10} to a_{20}, that's 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut in the sequence, at τ=6, T=16, y=4.\n\nNow, freeway y=4 is dangerous at τ=12,13,14, which is T=22,23,24, but at τ=6, T=16, not dangerous, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=10, T=20, y=8, dangerous at τ=4, T=14, past, safe.\n\nBut I need to check if at any point I am on a dangerous freeway.\n\nIn the path:\n\nAt τ=1, T=11, y=1: dangerous at τ=16-19, not 1, safe\n\nτ=2, T=12, y=2: same, safe\n\nτ=3, T=13, y=3: safe\n\nτ=4, T=14, y=3: safe (y=3 dangerous only 16-19)\n\nτ=5, T=15, y=3: safe\n\nτ=6, T=16, y=4: dangerous at τ=3,4,5,12,13,14; τ=6 not in, safe\n\nτ=7, T=17, y=5: dangerous only τ=4, not 7, safe\n\nτ=8, T=18, y=6: dangerous only τ=4, not 8, safe\n\nτ=9, T=19, y=7: same, safe\n\nτ=10, T=20, y=8: same, safe\n\nAnd at τ=11, y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut H=11 turns.\n\nCan I do with H=10?\n\nSuppose I reach y=9 at τ=10.\n\nThat means after 10 actions, y_{10}=9.\n\ny_{10} = sum of Δy from τ=0 to τ=9 actions.\n\nWith U=9, D=0, S=1? Net increase 9, so U - D =9, H = U + D + S.\n\nMinimal H when S=0 and D=0, U=9, H=9, but not possible due to obstacles.\n\nWith H=10, U - D =9, and S + D =1, since H = U + D + S = (9 + D) + D + S =9 + 2D + S.\n\nSet to 10, so 9 + 2D + S =10, so 2D + S=1.\n\nSo either D=0, S=1 or D=1, S=0.\n\nNow, if S=1, D=0, I have one stay, and 9 U.\n\nIf D=1, S=0, I have one down and 10 U, but U - D =10 -1=9, yes.\n\nNow, with one extra action, I need to avoid the occupied times.\n\nFor example, with one stay, I can stay at some point to shift the timing.\n\nCurrently with no stay, I would be at y=4 at τ=4 occupied.\n\nIf I stay earlier, say at y=0 or y=1.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, y=0, choose S, so at τ=1, y=0.\n\nThen U to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nThen U to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nU to y=3 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=3, safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 at τ=5.\n\nBut at τ=5, y=4 occupied, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, choose S, so at τ=2, y=1.\n\nThen U to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nU to y=3 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=3, safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 at τ=5, but occupied.\n\nSame.\n\nAt τ=2, y=2, choose S, so at τ=3, y=2.\n\nThen U to y=3 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=3, safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 at τ=5, occupied.\n\nStill problem.\n\nIf I use a down move.\n\nFor example, at some point go down and up.\n\nBut that might take more net actions.\n\nWith D=1, S=0, H=10, U=10, D=1, net U-D=9.\n\nSo I go down once and up ten times, but net +9.\n\nFor example, at some point, I go down, then later up, so I stay at a level or go back.\n\nBut to save time, I need to avoid the occupied spot.\n\nSuppose at τ=3, y=3, instead of staying, I go down to y=2 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at τ=4, I go U to y=3 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, y=3, safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 at τ=6.\n\nSame as before, but I used a D and U instead of S S, so I have two extra actions effectively, but with net, I have U=9, D=1, S=0? In this case, to reach y=4 at τ=6, I need actions.\n\nFrom start: τ=0: U to y1 τ=1\n\nτ=1: U to y2 τ=2\n\nτ=2: U to y3 τ=3\n\nτ=3: D to y2 τ=4? At τ=3, y=3, choose D, so y4 = y3 + (-1) = 3-1=2 at τ=4\n\nτ=4: y=2, choose U, to y3 at τ=5\n\nτ=5: y=3, choose U, to y4 at τ=6\n\nThen same as before, but I reached y=4 at τ=6 with one down and one up extra, so I have used more U, but net, from y=0 to y=4 at τ=6, I took 6 actions: U,U,U,D,U,U to go from 0 to 4 in 6 steps, whereas with stay it was U,U,U,S,S,U to y4 at τ=6, also 6 actions.\n\nBut with down and up, I have an extra down and up, so for the whole to y=9, I will have more actions.\n\nFor example, to y=9, with down: after y=4 at τ=6, then U to y5 τ=7, U to y6 τ=8, U to y7 τ=9, U to y8 τ=10, U to y9 τ=11, same as before, but I used one D, so U=10, D=1, S=0, H=11, same as before with S.\n\nIn the stay case, U=9, S=2, D=0, H=11.\n\nWith down, U=10, D=1, S=0, H=11.\n\nSame H.\n\nBut for H=10, I need to reach y=9 in 10 actions.\n\nSuppose I have U=9, S=1, D=0.\n\nThen I stay once.\n\nNow, I need to place the stay so that I avoid being on y=4 at τ=4 or τ=5.\n\nIf I stay early, say at τ=0, S, then y=0 at τ=1.\n\nThen U to y1 τ=2, U to y2 τ=3, U to y3 τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=3.\n\nThen U to y4 τ=5, but at τ=5 y=4 occupied.\n\nIf I stay at τ=1, y=1 at τ=2 (after S at τ=1).\n\nSet: τ=0: U to y1 τ=1\n\nAt τ=1: S, so y=1 at τ=2\n\nτ=2: U to y2 τ=3\n\nτ=3: U to y3 τ=4\n\nτ=4: y=3, U to y4 τ=5, occupied.\n\nSame.\n\nIf stay at τ=2: τ=0 U y1 τ=1\n\nτ=1 U y2 τ=2\n\nτ=2 S, y=2 at τ=3\n\nτ=3 U to y3 τ=4\n\nτ=4 y=3, U to y4 τ=5, occupied.\n\nAlways when I go to y=4 at τ=5, occupied.\n\nIf I stay later, but at τ=3, if I stay, y=3 at τ=4, then I go to y=4 at τ=6, as before, but with one stay, I can only shift by one turn, but I need to avoid both τ=4 and τ=5 for y=4.\n\nIn the direct path, at τ=4 I would be on y=4 occupied, and at τ=5 on y=5 occupied if I go up, but with one stay, I might be on y=4 at τ=5 or something.\n\nBut y=4 occupied at τ=5.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=4 at τ=5.\n\nThe only safe for y=4 near are τ=2,6,7,etc.\n\nBut τ=2 too early, cannot reach.\n\nSo with one stay, I cannot reach a safe y=4 earlier than τ=6.\n\nThus H=10 not possible.\n\nWith U=10, D=1, S=0, but net +9, so I go up to y=10 or something, but y max 9, so at some point I must go down, but since I end at y=9, I might go up to y=8, then down to y=7 or something, but that seems worse, and I might hit occupied times.\n\nFor example, suppose I go up fast to y=8, but at τ=4, if I am on high y, occupied.\n\nEarliest at y=8: at τ=8 with all U, but at τ=4, I would be on y=4 occupied, or if I delay.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo probably H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 4, there is a car at (24,13,right,4) which we ignored because τ min and max negative.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any time it could be issue.\n\nFor that car, head=24, tail=13, s=4, direction right.\n\nτ min = ceil(-24/4)=ceil(-6)= -6\n\nτ max = floor(-13/4)=floor(-3.25)= -4\n\nSo at τ=-6,-5,-4, T=4,5,6, before, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nNow, in my path, I reach y=9 at τ=11, T=21.\n\nBut at τ=6, T=16, y=4, and freeway 4 has dangerous at τ=12,13,14, which is later.\n\nBut I am at y=4 at τ=6, safe.\n\nThen I leave quickly.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nBut in the action sequence, I have to output for turns starting from t1=10.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nNow, but in the path, at τ=10, T=20, I am at y=8, go U to y=9.\n\nBut y=8 at τ=10, which is safe.\n\nNow, but let me write the actions.\n\nThe sequence of actions from turn t1=10 onwards.\n\nAt turn T=10, τ=0, position (0,0), action a_{10}\n\nAs above, a_{10} = U\n\nThen at T=11, τ=1, y=1, action a_{11} = U\n\nT=12, τ=2, y=2, action a_{12} = U\n\nT=13, τ=3, y=3, action a_{13} = S  (since I stayed)\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t1} = a_{10}\n\nThen turn t1+1: a_{11}, etc.\n\nIn my earlier:\n\nAt T=10: action U, to y=1 at next turn.\n\nAfter action, position.\n\nBut in the output, it should be the action at each turn.\n\nAnd the position after action, but we output actions only.\n\nNow, for freeway 5,6,7,8, they have a car at (0,-11,right,12) which at τ=0, head=0, so at τ=0, it occupies x=0.\n\nBut at τ=0, if I were on y=5, I would collide, but I am at y=0.\n\nSimilarly, in my path, I am not on y=5 at τ=0.\n\nNow, another thing: for freeway 4, at τ=3,4,5 occupied, which I avoided.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 4, there is a car (-12,-23,right,4), which at τ=3,4,5, and another at (-48,-59,right,4) at τ=12,13,14.\n\nAnd the third one not relevant.\n\nNow, I think H=11 is best.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach earlier by using a different path.\n\nSuppose I go to y=4 at τ=6, but then I go up continuously, but at τ=10, y=8, to y=9 at τ=11.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=4 at τ=6, but then since y=5 is safe, I go up, but I need to spend turns.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=4, I am at y=3, instead of staying, I go to y=4 at τ=5, but occupied, not possible.\n\nOr, I can go directly to y=5 from y=3? No, I have to go to y=4 first.\n\nUnless I can jump, but no, only adjacent moves.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway 5, etc.\n\nFor example, at τ=4, y=5 occupied, but in my path I am not there.\n\nNow, output the actions.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: S  (since at T=13, y=3, choose S)\n\nTurn 14: S  (at T=14, y=3, choose S)\n\nIn terms of turns:\n\nAt turn T=10: position (0,0), action U, so next position (0,1) at T=11\n\nAt T=11: position (0,1), action U, next (0,2) at T=12\n\nAt T=12: position (0,2), action U, next (0,3) at T=13\n\nAt T=13: position (0,3), action S, so next position still (0,3) at T=14\n\nAt T=14: position (0,3), action S, next (0,3) at T=15\n\nAt T=15: position (0,3), action U, next (0,4) at T=16\n\nAt T=16: position (0,4), action U, next (0,5) at T=17\n\nAt T=17: position (0,5), action U, next (0,6) at T=18\n\nAt T=18: position (0,6), action U, next (0,7) at T=19\n\nAt T=19: position (0,7), action U, next (0,8) at T=20\n\nAt T=20: position (0,8), action U, next (0,9) at T=21\n\nAt T=21, position (0,9), reached.\n\nSo actions from turn 10 to turn 20, that's 11 actions: a_{10} to a_{20}.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to list until we reach.\n\nIn the answer, it should be the actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nHere t1=10, H=11, so turns 10 to 20.\n\nActions: U, U, U, S, S, U, U, U, U, U, U\n\nFor turns: 10:U, 11:U, 12:U, 13:S, 14:S, 15:U, 16:U, 17:U, 18:U, 19:U, 20:U\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 10: a_{10} = U\n\nTurn 11: a_{11} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 20: a_{20} = U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 21, y=9.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 5, at τ=0, there is a car with head=0, so at T=10, if on y=5, collide, but I am not.\n\nSimilarly, at T=16, which is τ=6, y=4, freeway 4, not occupied, as τ=6 not in 3,4,5 or 12,13,14.\n\nτ=6.\n\n12,13,14 is later.\n\nBut T=16 is τ=6, yes.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn T=13, action S, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps I can have only one wait.\n\nSuppose at τ=3, y=3, I go S to stay at τ=4 y=3.\n\nThen at τ=4, y=3, instead of staying again, I go directly to y=4 at τ=5, but occupied.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo to y=2 or something, worse.\n\nSo I think two waits are necessary.\n\nThus minimal H=11.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nBut in the output, it should be in the box.\n\nAlso, for freeway 4, there is a car at (24,13,right,4), but we think it's not an issue.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster after.\n\nBut no.\n\nAnother thought: at τ=11, I reach y=9, but τ=11 is T=21.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach earlier by not waiting twice.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=3 at τ=3.\n\nThen at τ=3, I go U to y=4 at τ=4, but occupied, collision, not possible.\n\nUnless for that freeway, at that time, but no.\n\nPerhaps the cars on other freeways, but I have to be on y=4 when moving.\n\nI think not.\n\nSo I believe H=11 is minimal.\n\nSo the action sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11. The sequence of actions from turn 10 to turn 20 ensures the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 21 without colliding with any cars.\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Player Movement**: The player starts at (0, 0) at turn 10. Each action \\(a_t \\in \\{U, D, S\\}\\) changes the vertical position by +1 (U), -1 (D), or 0 (S) for the next turn, with position constrained to \\(y \\in [0, 9]\\).\n- **Collision Avoidance**: Collision occurs only if, at turn \\(T\\), the player is on freeway \\(y_T\\) (for \\(y_T \\in \\{1, \\dots, 8\\}\\)) and the x-position 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway. The car positions are updated linearly based on their speed and direction (all cars are right-moving in this state).\n- **Dangerous Times**: Based on car states, the dangerous turns (when x=0 is occupied) for each freeway are:\n  - Freeway 1: Turns 26, 27, 28, 29 (\\(\\tau = 16, 17, 18, 19\\))\n  - Freeway 2: Turns 26, 27, 28, 29 (\\(\\tau = 16, 17, 18, 19\\))\n  - Freeway 3: Turns 26, 27, 28, 29 (\\(\\tau = 16, 17, 18, 19\\))\n  - Freeway 4: Turns 13, 14, 15 and 22, 23, 24 (\\(\\tau = 3, 4, 5\\) and \\(\\tau = 12, 13, 14\\))\n  - Freeway 5: Turns 14 and 24 (\\(\\tau = 4\\) and \\(\\tau = 14\\), but \\(\\tau = 14\\) is late and avoided)\n  - Freeway 6: Turns 14 and 24 (\\(\\tau = 4\\) and \\(\\tau = 14\\), avoided)\n  - Freeway 7: Turns 14 and 24 (\\(\\tau = 4\\) and \\(\\tau = 14\\), avoided)\n  - Freeway 8: Turns 14 and 24 (\\(\\tau = 4\\) and \\(\\tau = 14\\), avoided)\n  - Freeways 0 and 9 are always safe (no cars).\n- **Path Selection**: \n  - Going straight up (all U actions) would cause a collision at turn 14 (y=4, τ=4) as freeway 4 is occupied.\n  - To avoid collisions, the player must wait at y=3 for two turns (turns 13 and 14) to delay the ascent to y=4 until turn 16 (τ=6), when freeway 4 is safe.\n  - After reaching y=4 safely, the player can move up continuously to y=9 without further delays, as all higher freeways are safe except at τ=4, which is past.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns 10 to 20 (11 actions) results in the player reaching (0, 9) at turn 21:\n- Turn 10: U (move to y=1 at turn 11)\n- Turn 11: U (move to y=2 at turn 12)\n- Turn 12: U (move to y=3 at turn 13)\n- Turn 13: S (stay at y=3 at turn 14 to avoid y=4 at τ=4)\n- Turn 14: S (stay at y=3 at turn 15 to avoid y=4 at τ=5)\n- Turn 15: U (move to y=4 at turn 16; freeway 4 safe at τ=6)\n- Turn 16: U (move to y=5 at turn 17; freeway 5 safe)\n- Turn 17: U (move to y=6 at turn 18; freeway 6 safe)\n- Turn 18: U (move to y=7 at turn 19; freeway 7 safe)\n- Turn 19: U (move to y=8 at turn 20; freeway 8 safe)\n- Turn 20: U (move to y=9 at turn 21)\n\n### Verification:\n- At turn 16 (τ=6), y=4: Freeway 4 is safe (dangerous at τ=3,4,5,12,13,14; τ=6 not included).\n- At all other turns on freeways 1-8, the player is not present during dangerous times (e.g., y=5 at turn 17 (τ=7) is safe as dangerous only at τ=4).\n- The path reaches y=9 at turn 21 (τ=11) before later dangerous times (e.g., τ=12 for y=4).\n\nThis sequence minimizes \\(H\\) to 11, as fewer turns (e.g., \\(H=10\\)) would require being on y=4 or y=5 during dangerous turns τ=4 or τ=5, causing collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1=13, and I start at y=3.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. Cars move left or right with given speeds. For collision, I care about when a car's span includes x=0 at the turn when I'm on that freeway.\n\nThe key point is that collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car with 0 in its span at that exact turn T. Also, when I move to a new y, I'm not considered on that new y until the next turn. So if I move up or down, at turn T I'm on y_T, and I move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nIn the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so at turn t, position is (0, y_t), and after action, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nThen for collision at turn T: I'm on y_T, and for that freeway, at turn T, there is a car with 0 in span(T).\n\nAlso, note that cars are on specific freeways, each freeway has its own set of cars.\n\nIn the car state table, freeway k from 1 to 8, each with cars listed.\n\nLet me list all cars for each freeway at t=13.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h=-39, tail τ=-50, direction right, speed 3. Since direction is right, span is [τ, h] = [-50, -39] at t=13.\n\nThen at time T, span = [τ + s(T-13), h + s(T-13)] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: one car, (-39,-50,right,3), so span [-50,-39] at t=13.\n\nFreeway 3: same, one car, (-39,-50,right,3), span [-50,-39] at t=13.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars:\n\nFirst: (-36,-47,right,4), so span [-47,-36] at t=13? Head and tail: for right-moving, span is [tail, head] since tail to head in direction.\n\nThe notation says: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h], so head is larger, tail smaller.\n\nIn the car state: \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, span is [τ, h], so τ < h.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving, span [h, τ] with h > τ or something? But here all seem right-moving except possibly, but in this case, all cars are right-moving? Let me check.\n\nIn freeway 4: all right, I think.\n\nFirst car: h=-36, τ=-47, right, s=4. Since right, τ=-47, h=-36, so at t=13, span is [τ, h] = [-47, -36].\n\nSimilarly, second car: (0, -11, right, 4), so h=0, τ=-11, span [-11, 0] at t=13.\n\nThird car: (36, 25, right, 4)? h=36, τ=25, but 25 to 36, right, so at t=13, span [25,36].\n\nBut x from left to right, I assume, so smaller x left, larger x right.\n\nNow, for collision, at x=0.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (-12,-23,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nFirst car: h=-12? Head h=-12, tail τ=-23, right, s=12, span [τ,h] = [-23,-12] at t=13.\n\nSecond car: h=36, τ=25, span [25,36] at t=13.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5? Let's see.\n\nFreeway 6: (-12,-23,right,12) and (36,25,right,12), same as freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 7: same, (-12,-23,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: same, (-12,-23,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nNow, freeways 1,2,3 each have one car with span [-50,-39] at t=13, which is far left, not near 0.\n\nFreeway 4 has three cars: one at [-47,-36], one at [-11,0], and one at [25,36]. The one at [-11,0] has 0 in its span at t=13, since span [-11,0], so 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways: 5,6,7,8 each have cars at [-23,-12] and [25,36], neither includes 0 at t=13.\n\nFor freeway 4, at t=13, there is a car with span [-11,0], so 0 is in it, meaning if I were on freeway 4 at turn 13, I would collide. But I'm at y=3, not y=4, so no collision now.\n\nI start at y=3 at turn 13.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny from 0 to 9, freeways 1 to 8 are between, I think y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe problem says: avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars there.\n\nNow, I need to move from y=3 to y=9, which means I need to go up 6 steps, but I can move up, down, or stay, so minimal H would be 6 if I can go up directly, but I have to avoid cars on the freeways when I'm on them.\n\nSince I can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, I need at least 6 turns to go from 3 to 9.\n\nBut I might need to wait or detour if there are cars blocking.\n\nNow, let's think about when cars are at x=0 for each freeway.\n\nFor a given freeway k, and at turn T, I need to know if there is a car on k with 0 in span(T).\n\nSince the cars move, I need to compute for each freeway and each turn, whether x=0 is occupied by a car on that freeway.\n\nBut turns are discrete, so I can compute for each freeway the times when 0 is covered.\n\nFirst, let's define the span at time T for each car.\n\nGeneral: for a car on freeway k, at time T, span is:\n\nIf direction right: [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]  since from t1, it moves right.\n\nt1 is 13, so let τ = T - 13, time offset.\n\nSet τ = T - 13, so at τ=0, it's turn 13.\n\nThen for a right-moving car with initial span [τ_i, h_i] at τ=0, at time τ, span is [τ_i + s τ, h_i + s τ]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, but here all cars are right-moving, from the data.\n\nIn freeway 4, all right, freeway 5-8 all right, and 1,2,3 all right, so no left-moving cars.\n\nAll cars are right-moving.\n\nSo for any car, at time offset τ, span is [τ_i + s τ, h_i + s τ]\n\nx=0 is in span if τ_i + s τ ≤ 0 ≤ h_i + s τ\n\nThat is, min(τ_i + s τ, h_i + s τ) ≤ 0 ≤ max(τ_i + s τ, h_i + s τ)\n\nBut since for right-moving, τ_i < h_i, so min is τ_i + s τ, max is h_i + s τ, so:\n\nτ_i + s τ ≤ 0 ≤ h_i + s τ\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need the set of τ where for some car on that freeway, this holds.\n\nThen, for a freeway k, it is occupied at time τ if there exists a car on k such that τ_i + s τ ≤ 0 ≤ h_i + s τ for that car.\n\nThen, when I am on freeway y at time τ (turn t1+τ), I need that freeway y is not occupied at that time.\n\ny is the freeway index, same as k.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and the condition.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, τ_i = -50, h_i = -39, s=3\n\nSo condition: -50 + 3τ ≤ 0 ≤ -39 + 3τ\n\nThat is, -50 + 3τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -39 + 3τ\n\nFirst inequality: -50 + 3τ ≤ 0 => 3τ ≤ 50 => τ ≤ 50/3 ≈ 16.666, so τ ≤ 16 since integer? τ is integer, since turns discrete.\n\nτ is time offset in turns, so integer.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 ≤ -39 + 3τ => 39 ≤ 3τ => τ ≥ 13.\n\nSo for τ from 13 to 16 inclusive.\n\nτ ≥ 13 and τ ≤ 16.\n\nτ=13: -50+39 = -11 ≤0? -50 +3*13 = -50+39= -11 ≤0, and 0 ≤ -39+39=0, yes 0≤0.\n\nτ=14: -50+42= -8≤0, 0≤ -39+42=3, yes.\n\nτ=15: -50+45= -5≤0, 0≤ -39+45=6, yes.\n\nτ=16: -50+48= -2≤0, 0≤ -39+48=9, yes.\n\nτ=17: -50+51=1 ≤0? 1≤0 false, so no.\n\nSimilarly, τ=12: 0 ≤ -39+36= -3? 0≤-3 false.\n\nSo occupied at τ=13,14,15,16.\n\nBut freeway 1, at τ=0 (turn 13), is occupied? At τ=0, which is t=13, for freeway 1, car has span [-50,-39], which does not include 0, since -39 to -50? No, [-50,-39], so x from -50 to -39, 0 not in between, since -39 <0? -39 is less than 0, so span [-50,-39] is from x=-50 to x=-39, all negative, so 0 not in [ -50, -39], so at τ=0, for freeway 1, 0 not occupied.\n\nBut according to inequality: at τ=0, -50 +0 = -50 ≤0 true, but 0 ≤ -39 +0 = -39? 0 ≤ -39 false, so not satisfied.

No.\n\nτ=13 to16 means T= t1 + τ =13 +13=26 to 13+16=29.\n\nBut at τ=0, T=13, freeway 3: from above, for freeway 1,2,3, occupied at τ=13 to16, so at τ=0, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 4 at τ=0, occupied because of second car, τ=0,1,2 occupied.\n\nLet me list for each freeway the occupied times in terms of τ.\n\nFreeway 1: occupied τ=13,14,15,16\n\nFreeway 2: same, τ=13,14,15,16\n\nFreeway 3: same, τ=13,14,15,16\n\nFreeway 4: occupied τ=0,1,2 and τ=9,10,11\n\nFreeway 5: occupied τ=1\n\nFreeway 6: occupied τ=1\n\nFreeway 7: occupied τ=1\n\nFreeway 8: occupied τ=1\n\nNow, I start at τ=0, y=3, which is freeway 3.\n\nAt τ=0, freeway 3 is not occupied, since occupied from τ=13.\n\nSo I can be there.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, which is not a freeway, so no car, safe.\n\ny=9 is the top, no freeway, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly y=0.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 to y=9.\n\nEach move changes y by -1,0,1.\n\nI need to plan a path through the freeways avoiding occupied times.\n\nSince I can stay or move, I need to choose when to move to which freeway.\n\nLet me denote the position at time τ, y_τ.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=3\n\nI need to have for each τ, when I am on a freeway k, it should not be occupied at that τ.\n\nIf I am on y=0 or y=9, no problem.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no freeway.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8, so when on y=1 to 8, need no collision.\n\nAt time τ, if y_τ between 1 and 8, it must not be occupied at τ.\n\nIf y_τ =0 or 9, ok.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal steps: from y=3 to y=9, need at least 6 up moves.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down to avoid.\n\nFirst, let's see the occupied times.\n\nFreeway 3: occupied τ=13 to16\n\nBut τ=13 to16 is in the future, not immediate.\n\nτ=0 now.\n\nFreeway 4: occupied τ=0,1,2 and τ=9,10,11\n\nSo at τ=0,1,2, freeway 4 is occupied, so I cannot be on freeway 4 at τ=0,1,2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: occupied only at τ=1, so at τ=1, cannot be on freeway 5.\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8 at τ=1.\n\nNow, at τ=0, I am on y=3, freeway 3, which is not occupied at τ=0, so safe.\n\nI need to go up to y=4,5,etc.\n\nBut freeway 4 is occupied at τ=0,1,2, so I cannot be on freeway 4 during τ=0,1,2.\n\nThat means, if I try to move to y=4 at τ=0, but at τ=0, I am at y=3, and if I move up, at next turn τ=1, I will be at y=4.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position (0, y_T)\n\nI take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am at (0, y_{T+1})\n\nCollision at turn T if y_T between 1 and 8 and freeway y_T is occupied at time T.\n\nIn terms of τ, at time τ, position y_τ, if 1≤ y_τ ≤8, then must not have freeway y_τ occupied at τ.\n\nNow, for freeway 4, occupied at τ=0,1,2, so I cannot be on y=4 at τ=0,1,2.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5, occupied at τ=1, so cannot be on y=5 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=0, I am at y=3.\n\nIf I move up at τ=0, to y=4 at τ=1.\n\nBut at τ=1, y=4, which is freeway 4, and freeway 4 is occupied at τ=1, so collision at turn τ=1.\n\nIf I move down to y=2, or stay, or up.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince freeway 4 is occupied until τ=2, I cannot be on y=4 until after τ=2.\n\nThat is, at τ=3 or later, freeway 4 is safe, until τ=9,10,11 occupied again.\n\nτ=3 to8 freeway 4 is free? From above, freeway 4 occupied only at τ=0,1,2 and τ=9,10,11, so for τ=3,4,5,6,7,8, it is free.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: occupied only at τ=1, so for τ=0,2,3,... except τ=1, it is free.\n\nτ=0,2,3,4,... free, only τ=1 occupied.\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 3 occupied at τ=13,14,15,16, but now τ=0, so for τ=0 to12, freeway 3 is free, except? From earlier, for freeway 3, occupied τ=13 to16, so for τ=0 to12, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 occupied τ=13-16, free before.\n\nFreeway 1 same.\n\nBut I start at y=3, and need to go to y=9.\n\nNow, y=9 is safe.\n\nThe critical part is that freeway 4 is blocked from τ=0 to2, so I cannot go to y=4 during τ=0,1,2.\n\nThat means, at τ=1 and τ=2, I cannot be on y=4.\n\nAt τ=0, I am at y=3, not y=4.\n\nNow, let's think about moving.\n\nAt τ=0, I am at y=3.\n\nOptions: I can go up, down, or stay.\n\nIf I go up to y=4 at τ=1, but at τ=1, y=4 is occupied, collision.\n\nIf I go down to y=2 at τ=1.\n\ny=2 is freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 occupied at τ=13-16, not at τ=1, so safe.\n\nIf I stay, y=3 at τ=1, freeway 3 safe at τ=1.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince I cannot be on y=4 until τ=3, I should not move up immediately.\n\nPerhaps I should stay or go down for a few turns.\n\nBut going down might not help, since I need to go up later.\n\ny=5,6,etc have issues only at τ=1 for freeway 5-8.\n\nFreeway 5-8 occupied only at τ=1, so except at τ=1, they are safe.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some H.\n\nMinimal H: if no cars, I could go up each turn, from y=3 to4,5,6,7,8,9 in 6 turns, so at τ=6, y=9.\n\nBut with cars, may not be possible.\n\nFor example, if I try to go up at τ=0: to y=4 at τ=1, but at τ=1, y=4 occupied, collision.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nIf I stay at τ=0: at τ=1, y=3 still.\n\nThen at τ=1, I can move.\n\nAt τ=1, if I am at y=3, I can go up to y=4 at τ=2, but at τ=2, freeway 4 is still occupied (since τ=2 occupied), so if I go to y=4 at τ=2, collision.\n\nIf I go down to y=2 at τ=2.\n\ny=2 at τ=2, freeway 2 not occupied (since occupied only τ=13-16), so safe.\n\nBut I need to go up, so going down might delay.\n\nI could stay at y=3 for τ=0 and τ=1, then at τ=2, still y=3.\n\nThen at τ=2, I can move to y=4 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, freeway 4 is not occupied, since occupied only τ=0,1,2? τ=2 is occupied, τ=3 is not.\n\nτ=0,1,2 occupied, so τ=3 is free.\n\nSo at τ=3, if I am at y=4, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, from there I can go up.\n\nBut at τ=1, I need to be not on freeway 5,6,7,8 if possible, but at τ=1, freeway 5-8 are occupied, so I must not be on y=5,6,7,8 at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=1, y=4 is occupied, y=3 is safe, y=2 safe, y=1 safe, etc.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nSo at τ=1, I can be on y=0,1,2,3,9, but not 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nSince I start from y=3, at τ=1, I can be at y=2,3, or4 but y=4 not allowed, so only y=2 or y=3 or y=1 or y=0, but I need to go up, so y=2 or y=3.\n\nSimilarly at τ=0, I am at y=3.\n\nLet me define the state.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe constraints:\n\n- At τ=1, I cannot be on y=4,5,6,7,8\n\n- At τ=0,1,2, I cannot be on y=4\n\n- At τ=1, I cannot be on y=5,6,7,8\n\nSince freeway 5-8 occupied only at τ=1, so at other times, ok.\n\nFreeway 4 occupied τ=0,1,2, so cannot be on y=4 at τ=0,1,2.\n\nτ=0: I am at y=3, not y=4, so ok for y=4 at τ=0.\n\nBut at τ=0, if I were on y=4, it would be occupied, but I am not.\n\nNow, for moving.\n\nAt τ=0, I can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, then y_{1} =4, so at τ=1, y=4, but y=4 at τ=1 is occupied, collision.\n\nSo cannot do U at τ=0.\n\nIf D, then y_{1} =2, so at τ=1, y=2.\n\nFreeway 2 not occupied at τ=1, safe.\n\nIf S, then y_{1} =3, at τ=1, y=3, freeway 3 not occupied, safe.\n\nSo at τ=0, I can do D or S, not U.\n\nSuppose I do S at τ=0: then at τ=1, y=3.\n\nAt τ=1, I need to choose action.\n\nAt τ=1, position y=3.\n\nI can do U, D, S.\n\nIf U, y_{2} =4, so at τ=2, y=4.\n\nBut freeway 4 occupied at τ=2, so collision.\n\nIf D, y_{2} =2, at τ=2, y=2, freeway 2 not occupied, safe.\n\nIf S, y_{2} =3, at τ=2, y=3, safe.\n\nBut I need to go up, so S or D might not help.\n\nNow, at τ=2, if I am at y=3, I can do U to go to y=4 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=4, freeway 4 not occupied (since τ=3>2), safe.\n\nThen from there I can go up.\n\nBut at τ=1, if I do U, collision, so I cannot do U at τ=1 if at y=3.\n\nI have to do S or D at τ=1.\n\nSuppose at τ=0 I do S, so τ=1 y=3.\n\nThen at τ=1, I do S again, so τ=2 y=3.\n\nThen at τ=2, I do U, so to y=4 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=4, safe.\n\nNow, I can go up from here.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=4 at τ=3, I can go up to y=5 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nIs freeway 5 occupied at τ=4? Occupied only at τ=1, so at τ=4, not occupied, safe.\n\nSimilarly, go to y=6 at τ=5, freeway 6 not occupied at τ=5 (only τ=1), safe.\n\ny=7 at τ=6, safe.\n\ny=8 at τ=7, safe.\n\nThen y=9 at τ=8.\n\nAt τ=8, y=9, which is safe, and I reach.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nI used τ=0: S, τ=1: S, τ=2: U, τ=3: U (to y=5), τ=4: U (to y=6), τ=5: U (to y=7), τ=6: U (to y=8), τ=7: U (to y=9).\n\nAt τ=7, y=8, then U to y=9 at τ=8.\n\nSo from τ=0 to τ=8, that's 9 turns? Let's list the turns.\n\nτ is offset, number of turns from start.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=3.\n\nAfter first action, at τ=1, y_{1}\n\nAfter second action, τ=2, y_{2}, etc.\n\nI reach y=9 at some τ=H.\n\nIn this case: τ=0: y=3\n\nAction S: stay, so τ=1: y=3\n\nAction S: stay, τ=2: y=3\n\nAction U: up, to y=4 at τ=3\n\nAction U: to y=5 at τ=4\n\nAction U: to y=6 at τ=5\n\nAction U: to y=7 at τ=6\n\nAction U: to y=8 at τ=7\n\nAction U: to y=9 at τ=8\n\nSo at τ=8, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns? From τ=0 to τ=8, that's 9 time steps, but I think H is the number of actions or turns.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and after H actions, I am at y=9.\n\nAt turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, action a_{t1+t}, then at turn t1 + H, I am at position.\n\nThe player position after actions.\n\nStart: at turn t1, position (0, y_{t1})\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position (0, y_{t1+1})\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t1+H-1}, at turn t1+H, position (0, y_{t1+H})\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nH is the number of actions.\n\nIn terms of τ, at τ=0 (turn t1), position y.\n\nAfter first action, τ=1, position y1.\n\nAfter H actions, at τ=H, position y_H.\n\nWe want y_H =9.\n\nIn my sequence, I have actions from τ=0 to τ=7, that is 8 actions, to reach y=9 at τ=8.\n\nτ=0: action a0 (for time τ=0)\n\nAfter a0, at τ=1, position y1\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{H-1}, at τ=H, position y_H =9.\n\nSo H actions, from τ=0 to τ=H-1, position at τ=H.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\n- At τ=0: action S, so y1 =3\n\n- τ=1: action S, y2=3\n\n- τ=2: action U, y3=4\n\n- τ=3: action U, y4=5\n\n- τ=4: action U, y5=6\n\n- τ=5: action U, y6=7\n\n- τ=6: action U, y7=8\n\n- τ=7: action U, y8=9\n\nSo at τ=8, y=9, so H=8 actions.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nMinimal is 6 if I go up directly, but I cannot because of the block at y=4.\n\nI could go to y=5 or something earlier.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, if I do D, to y=2 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=2.\n\nNow at τ=1, I can do actions.\n\nAt τ=1, position y=2.\n\nI can do U to y=3 at τ=2? y=3 at τ=2.\n\nBut I need to go to y=4 eventually.\n\nAt τ=2, if I go U to y=3, then to y=4 at τ=3, same as before.\n\nAt τ=1, from y=2, I could go up to y=3 at τ=2, or stay, or down to y=1.\n\nBut going down not useful.\n\nSo similar to before.\n\nBut I started at y=3, went down to y=2, then need to come back, so it might take more turns.\n\nFor example:\n\nτ=0: D, to y=2 at τ=1\n\nτ=1: U, to y=3 at τ=2? If at τ=1 I do U, from y=2 to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=3, same as before, then U to y=4 at τ=3, etc.\n\nThen y=3 at τ=2, to y=4 τ=3, ..., up to y=9 at τ=8, same as before.\n\nBut I used one down and one up, so from τ=0 to τ=1 y=2, then τ=2 y=3, so at τ=2 I am at y=3, whereas in the first sequence at τ=2 I was at y=3 already without moving down. So it's the same.\n\nIn first sequence: τ=0 S, τ=1 y=3; τ=1 S, τ=2 y=3\n\nIn second: τ=0 D, τ=1 y=2; τ=1 U, τ=2 y=3\n\nThen same from τ=2 onwards.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nSuppose I stay at y=3 until τ=2, then go to y=4 at τ=3.\n\nBut from y=4 at τ=3, I go to y=5 at τ=4, etc., to y=9 at τ=8.\n\nIs there a way to be at y=4 earlier? No, because at τ=1 and τ=2, y=4 is occupied.\n\nAt τ=3 is the earliest I can be at y=4.\n\nThen from y=4 to y=9, need 5 up moves: to y5 τ4, y6 τ5, y7 τ6, y8 τ7, y9 τ8.\n\nSo at least τ=8 to reach y=9.\n\nBut y=9 at τ=8.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster to higher y.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, I could go down to y=2 or something, but that seems worse.\n\nOr, I could go to y=5 directly, but I have to go through y=4 first.\n\nUnless I skip, but no, I can only change by 1 each turn.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=1, I need to avoid y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nSince I am at y=3 at τ=1 if I stay or move.\n\nBut if at τ=0 I go down to y=2 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=2, which is safe.\n\nThen from there, I could go up to y=3 at τ=2, then to y=4 at τ=3, same.\n\nBut at τ=2, freeway 4 is still occupied? τ=2 is occupied for y=4.\n\nAt τ=2, if I go to y=4, collision.\n\nBut at τ=2, I can be at y=3 or other.\n\nThen at τ=3, to y=4.\n\nNo other way.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=5 at τ=1, but I cannot, because to be at y=5 at τ=1, I need to be at y=4 or y=6 at τ=0, but at τ=0 I am at y=3, so I can only go to y=2,3,4 at τ=1.\n\ny=4 is forbidden at τ=1, so only y=2 or y=3.\n\nSo no way to be at y=5 at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, I must wait until τ=3 to be at y=4.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nBut let's check if I can go to y=5 earlier via other path? No.\n\nAnother thought: the freeway 5-8 are only occupied at τ=1, so if I can be on them at other times.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, I could be on y=5, but at τ=0, I start at y=3, so not.\n\nTo be at y=5 at τ=0, not possible.\n\nAt τ=2, freeway 5 is safe, etc.\n\nBut to reach y=5, I need to be at y=4 or y=6 at τ=1, but at τ=1, y=4 and y=5,6,7,8 are all occupied or forbidden.\n\ny=4 occupied, y=5-8 occupied at τ=1.\n\nSo at τ=1, I cannot be on y=4 to 8.\n\nTherefore, the only possibilities at τ=1 are y=0,1,2,3.\n\nSince I start from y=3, likely y=2 or y=3.\n\nThen at τ=2, I can be at y=1,2,3,4 but y=4 occupied, so y=1,2,3.\n\nThen at τ=3, I can be at y=2,3,4,5, etc.\n\nBut y=4 is safe at τ=3.\n\nSo the earliest to be at y=4 is τ=3.\n\nThen to go to y=9, need 5 more moves, so at τ=8.\n\nBut perhaps I can go to y=3 to y=5 in some way, but no, because to go from y=3 to y=5, I need two up moves, but at the intermediate step, I would be at y=4, which at that time might be occupied.\n\nFor example, if I go up from y=3 to y=4 at some τ, but I cannot before τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3 I go to y=4, then to y=5 at τ=4, etc.\n\nNo shortcut.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to y=0 or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, go down to y=0, but then need to come up, more turns.\n\nSo minimal H should be 8.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have to specify actions.\n\nIn my first sequence: actions at τ=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nτ=0: S (stay)\n\nτ=1: S (stay)\n\nτ=2: U (up)\n\nτ=3: U (to y=5? Let's list positions)\n\nAt τ=0: after action, but actions are at the turn.\n\nTurn at time τ: position y_τ, then action a_τ determines y_{τ+1}\n\nFor collision: at turn τ, position y_τ, if 1≤y_τ≤8, check freeway occupied at τ.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt τ=0 (turn 13): position y=3, action S, so y_{1} =3\n\nCollision at τ=0: y=3, freeway 3, not occupied at τ=0, safe.\n\nAt τ=1 (turn 14): position y=3, action S, so y_{2} =3\n\nCollision: y=3, freeway 3, not occupied at τ=1 (since occupied τ=13-16, τ=1 is T=14? t1=13, τ=0 is t=13, τ=1 is t=14, etc.\n\nFreeway 3 occupied at τ=13 to16, which is t=13+13=26 to t=13+16=29, so at τ=1 (t=14), not occupied, safe.\n\nAt τ=2 (turn 15): position y=3, action U, so y_{3} =4\n\nCollision at τ=2: y=3, freeway 3, not occupied, safe.\n\nNow, after action U, at next turn τ=3, position y=4.\n\nAt τ=3 (turn 16): position y=4, action U, so y_{4} =5\n\nCollision at τ=3: y=4, freeway 4. Occupied? Freeway 4 occupied at τ=0,1,2,9,10,11. τ=3 not occupied, so safe.\n\nAt τ=4 (turn 17): position y=5, action U, so y_{5} =6\n\nCollision: y=5, freeway 5. Occupied only at τ=1, τ=4 not occupied, safe.\n\nAt τ=5 (turn 18): position y=6, action U, so y_{6} =7\n\nCollision: y=6, freeway 6, occupied only τ=1, safe.\n\nAt τ=6 (turn 19): position y=7, action U, so y_{7} =8\n\nCollision: y=7, freeway 7, occupied only τ=1, safe.\n\nAt τ=7 (turn 20): position y=8, action U, so y_{8} =9\n\nCollision at τ=7: y=8, freeway 8, occupied only τ=1, τ=7 not occupied, safe.\n\nThen at τ=8 (turn 21), position y=9, reached.\n\nSo H=8 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have actions from τ=0 to τ=7, that is 8 actions.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=7?\n\nSuppose I want to reach at τ=7, y=9.\n\nThen I need to start from y=3 at τ=0, and after 7 actions, at τ=7, y=9.\n\nNet change +6, so I need exactly 6 up moves and one other move, but since I can only change by 1, to have net +6 in 7 moves, I must have 6 up and one stay, or 7 up but I start at y=3, to y=9, difference 6, so with 7 moves, I can have 6 up and one stay, or 5 up and two down or something, but net must be +6.\n\nNumber of up minus number of down = 6.\n\nLet U be number of up, D down, S stay.\n\nThen U - D = 6, and U + D + S = H.\n\ny_H = y_0 + U - D = 3 + U - D.\n\nSet equal to 9, so U - D =6.\n\nAnd U + D + S = H.\n\nMinimal H when S=0 and U=6, D=0, H=6, but not possible.\n\nWith H=7, U - D =6, U + D + S =7.\n\nThen (U + D + S) - (U - D) = S + 2D =1.\n\nSince U - D =6, and U + D + S =7, subtract: (U+D+S) - (U-D) = S + 2D =1.\n\nSo S + 2D =1.\n\nSince S and D non-negative integers, possible if S=1, D=0; or S=0, D=0.5 not integer, so only S=1, D=0.\n\nThen U=6.\n\nSo with H=7, I must have exactly 6 up and 1 stay, no down.\n\nNow, the stay must be at some point.\n\nBut I need to avoid the collisions.\n\nSpecifically, I cannot be on y=4 at τ=1 or τ=2.\n\nIn the path, when do I go through y=4.\n\nSince I start at y=3, and go to y=9 with 6 up and one stay.\n\nThe stay can be at some y.\n\nBut I must be at y=4 at some point to go up.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=4 at a time when it is safe, i.e., not τ=0,1,2,9,10,11.\n\nBut τ=0,1,2 are the critical now.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nSuppose I go up at τ=0: but if I go up at τ=0, to y=4 at τ=1, but at τ=1, y=4 occupied, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nGo up at τ=1: at τ=1, if I am at y=3, go up to y=4 at τ=2, but at τ=2, y=4 occupied, collision.\n\nCannot go up at τ=1 if at y=3.\n\nBut at τ=1, I might not be at y=3.\n\nIn the path, at τ=0, if I do not go up, I must stay or down, but with no down, I must stay at τ=0 or something.\n\nWith H=7, U=6, D=0, S=1.\n\nSo one stay.\n\nAt τ=0, action: if I do U, to y=4 at τ=1, collision.\n\nCannot do U at τ=0.\n\nMust do S or D, but D not allowed, so must do S at τ=0.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=3.\n\nAt τ=1, action: if I do U, to y=4 at τ=2, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf I do S, then y=3 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, I can do U to y=4 at τ=3, safe.\n\nThen I need to go up 5 more times to y=9 at τ=8, but that would be τ=8, with actions up to τ=7.\n\nBut with H=7, I need to reach at τ=7.\n\nFrom τ=3 y=4, I need to reach y=9 at τ=7, which requires 5 up moves in 4 steps: from τ=3 to τ=7, 4 actions: to y5,y6,y7,y8 at τ=4,5,6,7, then y=8 at τ=7, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at τ=7, I need to be at y=8 at τ=6 or something.\n\nAfter action at τ=6, position at τ=7.\n\nIf at τ=6 I am at y=8, action U to y=9 at τ=7.\n\nSo I need to be at y=8 at τ=6.\n\nFrom y=4 at τ=3, to y=8 at τ=6, I need 4 up moves in 3 actions, impossible, since each action changes by at most 1.\n\nFrom τ=3 position y=4, after first action τ=3, to y5 at τ=4; action at τ=4 to y6 at τ=5; action at τ=5 to y7 at τ=6; action at τ=6 to y8 at τ=7. Then at τ=7 y=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at τ=7, I need y=9 at τ=7, so at τ=6 I must be at y=8 or y=9, but if y=9 at τ=6, then earlier.\n\nBut with the stay, it might be tight.\n\nSuppose I stay at a higher y.\n\nFor example, at some point I stay instead of going up.\n\nBut I need to go up 6 times.\n\nIn the sequence from τ=3 y=4 to τ=7 y=9, I need to go up 5 times, which takes 5 actions, so from τ=3 to τ=7, 4 actions, can only go up 4 times, to y=8 at τ=7.\n\nThen need another action to go to y=9 at τ=8.\n\nThus impossible to reach y=9 at τ=7 from y=4 at τ=3 with only 4 actions.\n\nSince I have one stay, I could use it earlier.\n\nBut at the beginning, if I stay at τ=0, then at τ=1 y=3.\n\nIf I could go to y=4 at τ=2, but cannot because occupied.\n\nNo other way.\n\nSuppose at τ=0 I go down to y=2, but with D=0, I cannot go down.\n\nWith H=7, I must have no down, only up and one stay.\n\nThus, I cannot avoid the collision at y=4 when trying to go up early.\n\nTherefore, H=7 is impossible.\n\nH=8 is the minimal.\n\nIn my sequence, I have two stays at the beginning.\n\nI could have the stay later, but it doesn't help to reduce H.\n\nFor example, if I go up as soon as possible.\n\nAt τ=0, S: y=3 at τ=1\n\nτ=1, S: y=3 at τ=2\n\nτ=2, U: to y=4 at τ=3\n\nThen τ=3, U: to y=5 at τ=4\n\nτ=4, U: to y=6 at τ=5\n\nτ=5, U: to y=7 at τ=6\n\nτ=6, U: to y=8 at τ=7\n\nτ=7, U: to y=9 at τ=8\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf at τ=6 I stay, then y=7 at τ=7, not 9.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo this seems optimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, at τ=3 to τ=7, I go up each time, no issue.\n\nNow, what about the later occupations, like freeway 4 at τ=9,10,11, but since I reach y=9 at τ=8, before that, no problem.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 at τ=13-16, but I am not there.\n\nSo fine.\n\nNow, I need to output the actions.\n\nCurrent turn t1=13.\n\nActions from t=13 to t=13+7=20? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions: for turns t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nH=8, so t from 0 to 7.\n\nTurn t1 + 0 = turn 13\n\nt1 +1 =14\n\n...\n\nt1 +7 =20\n\nActions: as above.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nAlso, I need to write the actions.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nAt turn 13: action S\n\nTurn 14: action S\n\nTurn 15: action U\n\nTurn 16: action U\n\nTurn 17: action U\n\nTurn 18: action U\n\nTurn 19: action U\n\nTurn 20: action U\n\nThen at turn 21, position y=9.\n\nBut turn 21 is t1 + 8, since t1=13, 13+8=21.\n\nt1 + H =13+8=21.\n\nNow, the car state has cars moving, but in this path, I don't go to other freeways except as above.\n\nBut just to confirm, at turn 16, which is τ=3 (since τ=0 at t13, t16 is τ=3), position y=4, freeway 4 not occupied, as above.\n\nSimilarly, all safe.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up earlier if I go down first, but that would require more downs or something, but with minimal turns, it should not help.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, go down to y=2 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, go up to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, go to y=4? But at τ=2, y=4 occupied, cannot.\n\nSo I have to wait until τ=3 to go to y=4.\n\nSame as before.\n\nThus, H=8 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nThe actions are for turns starting from t1=13.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 16: action U, to y=5 at turn 17.\n\nPosition at turn 17: y=5.\n\nBut in the actions, we list the actions per turn.\n\nThe answer should be the sequence of actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write the turns.\n\nAlso, the car state has freeway 4 with cars, but I think I covered.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 17, τ=4, y=5, freeway 5, which is safe, etc.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo minimal H=8.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but in the answer, it asks for the sequence, not H.\n\nBut I need to output the sequence.\n\nNow, in the format.\n\nSo for turn t1=13.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nThen after turn 20 action, at turn 21, position (0,9).\n\nH=8 actions.\n\nPerhaps I can have a different sequence, but same H.\n\nFor example, at the beginning, I could have down, but it doesn't reduce H.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nNow, write in the box.\n\nBut the car state has multiple cars, but I think I handled the occupations.\n\nOne thing: in freeway 4, at τ=0,1,2 occupied, but I avoided.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=1, freeways 5-8 occupied, but I was not on them.\n\nIn my path, at τ=1, I was on y=3, not 5-8.\n\nSo all good.\n\nThus, the sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 8. The sequence of actions must ensure that the player is not on a freeway \\(y\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y \\leq 8\\)) at any turn \\(T\\) when a car on that freeway has a span that includes \\(x = 0\\).\n\n### Key Constraints from Car Movements:\n- **Freeway 4** is occupied at turns \\(T = 13, 14, 15\\) (i.e., time offsets \\(\\tau = 0, 1, 2\\)) and \\(T = 22, 23, 24\\) (i.e., \\(\\tau = 9, 10, 11\\)). Thus, the player cannot be on \\(y = 4\\) at these turns.\n- **Freeways 5, 6, 7, and 8** are occupied only at turn \\(T = 14\\) (i.e., \\(\\tau = 1\\)). Thus, the player cannot be on \\(y = 5, 6, 7,\\) or \\(8\\) at this turn.\n- Freeways 1, 2, and 3 are occupied at turns \\(T = 26, 27, 28, 29\\) (i.e., \\(\\tau = 13, 14, 15, 16\\)), but these are beyond the relevant time frame for the minimal path.\n\nGiven the constraints:\n- At turn \\(T = 13\\) (\\(\\tau = 0\\)), the player is at \\(y = 3\\), which is safe (freeway 3 is not occupied at \\(\\tau = 0\\)).\n- Moving up to \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T = 14\\) (\\(\\tau = 1\\)) causes a collision because freeway 4 is occupied.\n- Similarly, moving up to \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T = 15\\) (\\(\\tau = 2\\)) causes a collision.\n- The earliest safe turn to be on \\(y = 4\\) is \\(T = 16\\) (\\(\\tau = 3\\)).\n\n### Optimal Path:\nThe player must wait at \\(y = 3\\) for two turns (turns 13 and 14) to avoid the occupied periods on \\(y = 4\\). Then:\n- At turn 15, move up to \\(y = 4\\) (now safe at \\(\\tau = 3\\)).\n- From turn 16 onwards, move up each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 21.\n\nThe sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) to 8, as fewer turns (e.g., \\(H = 7\\)) would require being on \\(y = 4\\) during an occupied turn or cannot achieve the net \\(+6\\) change in \\(y\\) with the constraints.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 13 (\\(T = 13\\), \\(\\tau = 0\\))**: Action \\(S\\) (stay), position at turn 14: \\(y = 3\\) (safe, freeway 3 not occupied).\n- **Turn 14 (\\(T = 14\\), \\(\\tau = 1\\))**: Action \\(S\\) (stay), position at turn 15: \\(y = 3\\) (safe, freeway 3 not occupied; avoids \\(y = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\) which are occupied at \\(\\tau = 1\\)).\n- **Turn 15 (\\(T = 15\\), \\(\\tau = 2\\))**: Action \\(U\\) (up), position at turn 16: \\(y = 4\\) (safe, freeway 4 not occupied at \\(\\tau = 3\\)).\n- **Turn 16 (\\(T = 16\\), \\(\\tau = 3\\))**: Action \\(U\\) (up), position at turn 17: \\(y = 5\\) (safe, freeway 5 not occupied at \\(\\tau = 4\\)).\n- **Turn 17 (\\(T = 17\\), \\(\\tau = 4\\))**: Action \\(U\\) (up), position at turn 18: \\(y = 6\\) (safe, freeway 6 not occupied at \\(\\tau = 5\\)).\n- **Turn 18 (\\(T = 18\\), \\(\\tau = 5\\))**: Action \\(U\\) (up), position at turn 19: \\(y = 7\\) (safe, freeway 7 not occupied at \\(\\tau = 6\\)).\n- **Turn 19 (\\(T = 19\\), \\(\\tau = 6\\))**: Action \\(U\\) (up), position at turn 20: \\(y = 8\\) (safe, freeway 8 not occupied at \\(\\tau = 7\\)).\n- **Turn 20 (\\(T = 20\\), \\(\\tau = 7\\))**: Action \\(U\\) (up), position at turn 21: \\(y = 9\\) (safe, no freeway).\n\nAt turn 21 (\\(t_1 + H = 13 + 8 = 21\\)), the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 13: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 15, and the player is at (0,3). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8 (y=1 to 8). The player moves vertically: U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay: y unchanged). The y-axis is from 0 to 9 (inclusive). Note that the goal is (0,9) and we start at (0,3).\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn the player is on a freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and the car on that freeway at turn T has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player is always 0).\n\nAlso note: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} (by U or D), at turn T the player is still on row y_T and only moves to y_{T+1} at the next turn (so at turn T, the player is on row y_T, and at turn T+1, the player is on row y_{T+1}).\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1 (15). We need to compute the car positions at future turns T (>=15) for each freeway.\n\nCar update:\n- Left-moving: the car moves left (negative x direction). The span at time t1 is [h, τ] (and note that for left-moving, h > τ because the head is at a higher x than the tail? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then at time T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. Since the car is moving left, the entire segment shifts left by s*(T-t1). Similarly, for right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note the representation for right-moving: at t1, the span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, the head is the front (which is at a higher x) and the tail at lower x? Actually, the problem states for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" meaning from tail to head? But in the table, for right-moving cars, the head and tail are given such that head > tail? Let's see the example:\n\nIn freeway 4: (-28,-39,right,4): note -28 > -39, so head is -28 and tail is -39? Then the span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-39, -28]. Then at time T, it becomes [ -39 + 4*(T-15), -28 + 4*(T-15) ].\n\nSimilarly, the other car on freeway 4: (8,-3,right,4): head=8, tail=-3 -> span at t1: [-3,8]. Then at T: [-3+4*(T-15), 8+4*(T-15)].\n\nBut wait, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\". So if the car is right-moving, then the initial span is [tail, head] (with tail < head). So the representation in the table for a right-moving car: (head, tail, direction, speed) actually gives head and tail, but note that for a right-moving car, the head should be to the right (greater x) of the tail. So the given head is the higher number and tail the lower.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, we don't have any in this problem, but if we did, the head would be the leftmost? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then moves left. And in the table, we have only right-moving cars.\n\nSo all cars in this state are right-moving. Therefore, for a car (head, tail, right, s) at t1, the span at time T is:\n  [ tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1) ]\n\nWe are at turn t1=15. We need to check for each freeway k (from 1 to 8) and for each turn T (>=15) whether if the player is on freeway k at turn T, then the car(s) on freeway k at turn T have a span that does not include 0.\n\nBut note: a freeway may have multiple cars. We must avoid any car that covers 0 at the exact turn we are on that freeway.\n\nWe are starting at y=3 at turn 15. We need to plan actions from turn 15 to turn 15+H-1, and at turn 15+H-1 we must be at y=9.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nLet's list the cars per freeway at t1=15:\n\nFreeway 1: [(-33, -44, right, 3)] -> one car: tail=-44, head=-33, s=3.\n  At time T: span = [ -44 + 3*(T-15), -33 + 3*(T-15) ]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: [ -44 + 3*(T-15), -33 + 3*(T-15) ]\n\nFreeway 3: same: [ -44 + 3*(T-15), -33 + 3*(T-15) ]\n\nFreeway 4: three cars:\n  car1: (-28,-39,right,4) -> [ -39 + 4*(T-15), -28 + 4*(T-15) ]\n  car2: (8,-3,right,4) -> [ -3 + 4*(T-15), 8 + 4*(T-15) ]\n  car3: (44,33,right,4) -> [ 33 + 4*(T-15), 44 + 4*(T-15) ]   [Note: head=44, tail=33? But 44>33, so that's consistent]\n\nFreeway 5: two cars:\n  car1: (12,1,right,12) -> [1 + 12*(T-15), 12 + 12*(T-15)]\n  car2: (60,49,right,12) -> [49 + 12*(T-15), 60 + 12*(T-15)]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway5: two cars with same parameters.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway5.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway5.\n\nWe note that freeways 1,2,3 are identical. Similarly, freeways 5,6,7,8 are identical.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k and for each turn T (>=15) whether the freeway is safe (i.e., no car on freeway k at turn T has a span that includes 0).\n\nWe are going to compute the safety for each freeway for a range of turns, say from T=15 to T=15+? (we need to go from y=3 to y=9, so at least 6 moves (if we go up every time) but we might need to wait sometimes.\n\nLet me compute the times when freeway k is unsafe (i.e., 0 is in at least one car's span on that freeway).\n\nFreeway 1 (and 2,3) at time T:\n  Car: [ -44 + 3*(T-15), -33 + 3*(T-15) ]\n  0 is in this interval if:\n      -44 + 3*(T-15) <= 0 <= -33 + 3*(T-15)\n  Solve:\n      -44 + 3*(T-15) <= 0  => 3*(T-15) <= 44 => T-15 <= 44/3 ≈ 14.666 => T <= 15+14.666 = 29.666 -> T<=29? But we need to check the other bound too.\n\n  Actually, we need:\n      -44 + 3*(T-15) <= 0 <= -33 + 3*(T-15)\n\n  Break into two inequalities:\n      1) -44 + 3*(T-15) <= 0  => 3*(T-15) <= 44 => T-15 <= 44/3 ≈ 14.666 => T <= 29 (since T integer)\n      2) 0 <= -33 + 3*(T-15) => 33 <= 3*(T-15) => T-15 >= 11 => T >= 26\n\n  So for T in [26, 29] (inclusive), freeway 1 is unsafe.\n\n  Similarly, freeway 2 and 3 are unsafe for T in [26,29].\n\nFreeway 4 at time T:\n\n  We have three cars. We need to check each.\n\n  Car1: [ -39 + 4*(T-15), -28 + 4*(T-15) ]\n      0 in this interval if:\n          -39 + 4*(T-15) <= 0 <= -28 + 4*(T-15)\n      => \n          -39 + 4*(T-15) <= 0 => 4*(T-15) <= 39 => T-15 <= 39/4 = 9.75 => T <= 24 (if T integer, then T<=24)\n          0 <= -28 + 4*(T-15) => 28 <= 4*(T-15) => T-15 >= 7 => T>=22\n      So T in [22,24] -> unsafe due to car1.\n\n  Car2: [ -3 + 4*(T-15), 8 + 4*(T-15) ]\n      0 in this interval if:\n          -3 + 4*(T-15) <= 0 <= 8 + 4*(T-15)\n      The right part (0 <= 8 + ...) is always true for T>=15 (since 8 + ... is at least 8 at T=15? Actually at T=15: -3+0 = -3, 8+0=8 -> 0 is between -3 and 8? Yes, at T=15: [ -3, 8] -> 0 is in it! So at T=15, car2 on freeway4 is at [-3,8] which includes 0.\n\n      Let me check: \n          T=15: [ -3+0, 8+0] = [-3,8] -> 0 is in [-3,8] -> unsafe.\n\n      How long? \n          Left: -3+4*(T-15) <= 0 -> always true for T>=15? Actually, when T increases, the interval moves right. So 0 will be in the interval until the entire interval moves past 0.\n\n          We require the interval to contain 0: \n          -3 + 4*(T-15) <= 0  => which is true for T <= (3/4)+15 = 15.75 -> so for T<=15? But wait, we are at T=15, and we have it. Also, the right bound: 0 <= 8+4*(T-15) is always true for T>=15? Actually, at T=15: 0<=8 -> true. At T=16: [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12]. So when does the left bound become greater than 0?\n          -3 + 4*(T-15) > 0 => 4*(T-15) > 3 => T-15 > 3/4 => T>=16.\n\n          Therefore, car2 covers 0 at T=15 only? Actually, at T=15: left=-3, right=8 -> 0 is in. At T=16: left=-3+4=1, right=8+4=12 -> 0 not in. So only T=15? \n\n      But wait: at T=15: we are at turn 15, and the player is at (0,3). We are not on freeway4 at turn15 (we are on y=3). So we don't care about freeway4 at turn15? Only if we are on y=4 at that turn.\n\n      However, if we are on freeway4 at turn T, then we must avoid when 0 is in the span of any car. So freeway4 is unsafe at T=15? But we are not there. It is unsafe at T=15? Yes, but if we are not on that row at T=15, then it's safe for us.\n\n      Similarly, for other T: \n          The car2 will cover 0 only at T=15? Because at T=16: [1,12] -> no 0.\n\n      What about T=14? But we start at T=15, so we don't care.\n\n      Actually, we are only concerned with T>=15.\n\n      So car2: unsafe only at T=15.\n\n      But wait: what if the car moves? At T=15: [ -3, 8] -> covers 0.\n      At T=16: [1,12] -> does not cover 0.\n      At T=17: [5,16] -> no.\n\n      So only T=15.\n\n  Car3: [33+4*(T-15), 44+4*(T-15)] -> both positive at T=15 (33 and 44) and increasing. So 0 is never in this interval.\n\n  Therefore, freeway4 is unsafe at T=15 (because of car2) and at T in [22,24] (because of car1).\n\n  So freeway4 is unsafe at T=15,22,23,24.\n\nFreeway5 (and 6,7,8) at time T:\n\n  Car1: [1 + 12*(T-15), 12 + 12*(T-15)]\n      Contains 0? \n          1 + 12*(T-15) <= 0 <= 12 + 12*(T-15)\n      The left bound: 1 + ... is at least 1 at T=15 -> so 0 is not in the interval at T=15. And it moves right. So never contains 0? Because the smallest value is 1 (at T=15) and then increases.\n\n  But wait: at T=15: [1,12] -> 0 not in. So safe for car1.\n\n  Car2: [49 + 12*(T-15), 60 + 12*(T-15)] -> even larger. So never contains 0.\n\n  Therefore, freeway5 (and 6,7,8) are always safe? \n\n  But wait: what if T is very large? The cars are moving to the right and are always positive? So yes, they are always safe.\n\n  However, let me check at T=15: \n      car1: [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n      car2: [49,60] -> safe.\n\n  So freeways 5,6,7,8 are always safe.\n\nSummary of unsafe times per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1,2,3: unsafe at T in [26,29] (inclusive)\nFreeway 4: unsafe at T in {15, 22,23,24}\nFreeway 5,6,7,8: always safe.\n\nWe start at turn 15 at y=3. We need to reach y=9.\n\nWe can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). But we want minimal turns.\n\nThe minimal number of moves to go from y=3 to y=9 is 6 (all U). But we must avoid being on an unsafe freeway at an unsafe time.\n\nNote: we are not required to avoid being on a freeway at a safe time? We only avoid when the freeway is unsafe at the exact turn we are on it.\n\nOur path: we are at y=3 at turn15. Then at turn16 we are at y=3,4, or 2? Then at turn17, etc.\n\nWe must avoid:\n- At turn15: we are at y=3. Freeway3 is safe at turn15? Because freeway3 is unsafe only at [26,29] -> so at turn15, freeway3 is safe. So we are safe at turn15.\n\nBut note: if we are at y=k at turn T, we check freeway k at turn T.\n\nWe are at y=3 at turn15: freeway3 is safe? Yes, because unsafe only at [26,29] and 15<26.\n\nNow, we want to go to y=9. The direct route: \n  Turn15: U -> y=4 at turn16? \n      Actually: \n        Turn15: we are at (0,3). We choose action a15. \n          If a15=U: then at turn16, we will be at y=4.\n          At turn15, we are at y=3 (safe, as above).\n          Then at turn16: we are at y=4 -> freeway4. But at turn16, freeway4: we have unsafe times {15,22,23,24} -> 16 is safe. So we can go.\n\nBut if we go up continuously:\n\n  Turn15: U -> y=4 at turn16\n  Turn16: U -> y=5 at turn17\n  Turn17: U -> y=6 at turn18\n  Turn18: U -> y=7 at turn19\n  Turn19: U -> y=8 at turn20\n  Turn20: U -> y=9 at turn21\n\nSo we would be at y=9 at turn21? Actually, we start at turn15 at y=3. Then:\n\n  t=15: action U -> at t=16: y=4\n  t=16: action U -> at t=17: y=5\n  t=17: action U -> at t=18: y=6\n  t=18: action U -> at t=19: y=7\n  t=19: action U -> at t=20: y=8\n  t=20: action U -> at t=21: y=9\n\nSo we reach at turn21. Now, we must check that along the way we are never on an unsafe freeway at an unsafe time.\n\nWe go through:\n  t15: y=3 -> safe (as above)\n  t16: y=4 -> freeway4 at t16: unsafe times are {15,22,23,24} -> 16 is safe.\n  t17: y=5 -> freeway5: always safe.\n  t18: y=6 -> freeway6: always safe.\n  t19: y=7 -> freeway7: always safe.\n  t20: y=8 -> freeway8: always safe.\n  t21: y=9 -> goal, and note that y=9 is not a freeway (freeways are 1..8) so no car to check? Actually, the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1..8\". So when we are at y=9, there is no freeway? So safe.\n\nBut wait: at turn21, we are at y=9. We are not on any freeway? So no collision. We are done at turn21.\n\nBut is this the minimal? H = 21-15+1? Actually, we did 6 moves (from t15 to t20) and at t21 we are at the goal. How many turns? We start at turn15 and we finish at turn21 (so we use turns 15,16,...,21: that's 7 turns? But note the sequence of actions: we take actions at turns 15,16,17,18,19,20 (6 actions) and then at turn21 we are at the goal without having to take an action? \n\nThe problem says: we are at turn t1 (15) and we take actions for t from 0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions. And then at turn t1 + H - 1? Let me read:\n\n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning a_{15}, a_{16}, ... a_{15+H-1}. Then at the next turn (after the last action) we are at turn t1+H. But the problem says \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nWait: the player update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t is determined by a_t.\n\nSo if we start at turn t1 (15) at y15=3, then:\n  a15 -> y16 = y15 + Δy15\n  a16 -> y17 = y16 + Δy16\n  ...\n  a_{t} -> y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nTherefore, after H actions (t=0 to H-1, meaning actions at turns 15, 16, ... 15+H-1), we are at turn 15+H, and the position is y_{15+H}. But the problem says we require y_{t1+H-1} = 9? That would be at turn 15+H-1.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nBut note: the sequence of actions is from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1. Then at the end of these actions, we are at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut the update rule: at turn t, we take action a_t, and then the next state (at turn t+1) is computed.\n\nSo at the start of turn t1 (15), we are at (0,3). Then we take action a15 -> then at turn16 we are at y16 = 3 + Δy15.\n\nThen at turn16, we take a16 -> then at turn17: y17 = y16 + Δy16.\n\nSo after taking H actions, we have advanced to turn t1+H (i.e., 15+H). And we are at y_{15+H}.\n\nBut the problem says we require y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nThis would imply that at turn t1+H-1 (i.e., 15+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nBut note: at turn15 (t1) we start, and we take the first action a15. Then at turn16, we have y16. Then we take a16 -> turn17: y17, etc.\n\nTo have y_{15+H-1}=9, that means we take H-1 actions? \n\nBut the sequence is defined for t from 0 to H-1: that's H actions. And the turn indices: t1 + t for t=0,...,H-1 -> turns 15, 16, ... 15+H-1.\n\nAnd then we require that at turn 15+H-1, the y-coordinate is 9.\n\nBut how? At turn15: we start at y15=3. Then we take a15 -> then at turn16: y16 = 3 + Δa15. Then at turn15+H-1: we have taken H-1 actions? \n\nWait: \n  t = 0: action at t1+0 = 15 -> affects y16\n  t = 1: action at t1+1 = 16 -> affects y17\n  ...\n  t = k: action at t1+k -> affects y_{t1+k+1}\n\nSo the last action in the sequence is at t1+H-1, which affects y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the problem says: we require y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nThat would be the state at the beginning of the action at turn t1+H-1? Or after the action?\n\nActually, the state at turn t (the beginning of the turn) is y_t. Then we take action a_t, and then we get y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t1+H-1 (15+H-1), we are at y_{15+H-1}. Then we take action a_{15+H-1}, and then we get y_{15+H}. But the problem says we require y_{15+H-1}=9? \n\nThat means we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn 15+H-1, and then we take an action? But that action might move us away? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, let me read: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nBut the problem states: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nSo we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1}? But then we might leave? \n\nBut the problem says we only care about being at (0,9) at some turn. And the minimal H such that we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut note: we start at turn15 at (0,3). Then we take actions until we get to (0,9). The turn at which we first arrive at (0,9) is the turn we finish.\n\nHow do we arrive? \n  We take an action at turn t, and then at turn t+1 we are at (0,9). \n\nBut the problem says we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nSo if we are at (0,9) at turn T, then T = t1+H-1 -> H = T - t1 + 1.\n\nAnd we take actions from turn15 to turn T-1? \n\nBut the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, which is 15 to (15+H-1) = T.\n\nBut if we are at (0,9) at turn T, then the last action we took was at turn T-1, which moved us to (0,9) at turn T.\n\nSo the sequence of actions should be from turn15 to turn T-1. Then the number of actions is (T-1) - 15 + 1 = T-15.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence is of length H, and we take actions at turns 15,16,...,15+H-1. And we are at (0,9) at turn 15+H-1.\n\nSo if we are at (0,9) at turn T, then T = 15+H-1 -> H = T-14.\n\nAnd the actions are taken at turns: 15,16,...,T-1? But T = 15+H-1, so the last action is at turn T-1? That matches: because the last action we take is at turn T-1 to get to turn T at (0,9).\n\nTherefore, in the sequence, we do not take an action at the turn we are at (0,9). We only take actions until the turn before.\n\nNow, in our direct plan: we start at turn15 at y=3. Then:\n\n  At turn15: take U -> turn16: y=4\n  turn16: take U -> turn17: y=5\n  turn17: take U -> turn18: y=6\n  turn18: take U -> turn19: y=7\n  turn19: take U -> turn20: y=8\n  turn20: take U -> turn21: y=9\n\nSo at turn21, we are at y=9. Therefore, T=21. Then H = T - 14 = 21 - 14 = 7? \n\nBut the sequence of actions: from turn15 to turn15+H-1 = 15+7-1 = 21? That would be 7 actions: at turns15,16,17,18,19,20,21. But at turn21 we are already at y=9? Then why take an action at turn21?\n\nAlternatively, if we set T=21, then we are at (0,9) at turn21. Then the last action that got us there was at turn20. So we only need actions at turns15 to20 (6 actions). Then H would be 6? and then 15+H-1 = 15+6-1 = 20? But we are at (0,9) at turn21, not at turn20.\n\nThe problem says: we require y_{t1+H-1}=9. So we require at turn15+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\nIn the above, we are at y=9 at turn21. So we require 15+H-1 = 21 -> H-1 = 6 -> H=7.\n\nBut then we take 7 actions: at turns15,16,17,18,19,20,21. And at the end of the 7th action (at turn21) we are at y_{22}? \n\nBut we were at y=9 at turn21? Then after the action at turn21, we are at y22 = 9 + Δy21. But we want to be at y=9 at turn21, so we don't want to move? \n\nSo the last action must be S? Or we can stop earlier? \n\nActually, the problem says we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). Then we take an action at that turn? But then we might leave. \n\nBut the problem does not require that we stay, only that we reach at that turn. \n\nHowever, we are required to output H actions. And at the turn after the last action, we are at turn t1+H, and we are not constrained? \n\nBut the condition is: at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nSo if we are at (0,9) at turn21, then we set H such that 15+H-1=21 -> H=7.\n\nThen we take 7 actions: at turns15,16,17,18,19,20,21. \n\nBut at turn21, we are already at (0,9) at the beginning of the turn. Then we take an action at turn21. What action? It doesn't matter as long as we don't leave? But if we take U, we go to 10, which is invalid (since y must be in [0,9])? Or if we take D, we go to 8. \n\nBut the problem doesn't say we have to stay at 9. It only says to reach (0,9). So we can leave immediately? \n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9) at some turn. The minimal H is the minimal number of actions such that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nIn our plan, we are at (0,9) at turn21. So we need H=7. Then we must take 7 actions. The first 6 actions (U at turns15 to20) get us to (0,9) at turn21. Then at turn21, we must take an action? But we are already at the goal at the beginning of turn21. Then the action at turn21 can be S (stay) so that we remain at 9? \n\nBut note: if we take S at turn21, then at turn22 we are still at 9. But we only require to be at 9 at turn21. \n\nSo the sequence for H=7: \n  a15=U, a16=U, a17=U, a18=U, a19=U, a20=U, a21=S? \nBut then at turn21: we start at y=9 (because at the end of turn20 we are at y=9 at turn21) -> then we take a21=S -> then at turn22: y=9.\n\nBut we are at (0,9) at turn21 (the beginning) and we are still at turn21 after taking the action? Actually, the state at the beginning of turn21 is y21=9. Then we take a21=S -> then at turn22 we are at y22=9.\n\nBut the condition is only that at turn21 (which is 15+7-1=21) we are at y=9. So we are.\n\nBut note: we must avoid collisions at every turn we are on a freeway. At turn21, we are at y=9. There is no freeway at y=9? So safe.\n\nBut wait: what if we don't take an extra action? Can we have H=6? Then we would be at turn15+6-1=20. So at turn20 we must be at y=9. But in our plan, at turn20 we are at y=8 (because we took U at turn19: then at turn20 we are at y=8). Then we take U at turn20 to get to y=9 at turn21. So at turn20 we are at y=8, not 9. Therefore, to be at y=9 at turn20, we would have to be there at the beginning of turn20.\n\nBut we start at y=3 at turn15. The fastest we can get to y=9 is 6 moves: \n  turn15: U -> y16=4\n  turn16: U -> y17=5\n  turn17: U -> y18=6\n  turn18: U -> y19=7\n  turn19: U -> y20=8\n  turn20: U -> y21=9\n\nSo we are at y=9 at turn21. We cannot be at y=9 at turn20. Therefore, the minimal H is 7.\n\nBut we can try to go faster? We can't because we need 6 moves to cover 6 units (from 3 to 9).\n\nSo H=7 is minimal.\n\nBut we must check that we don't run into an unsafe condition.\n\nIn the above plan, we are at:\n  turn15: y=3 -> safe (freeway3 safe at t15)\n  turn16: y=4 -> freeway4 at t16: unsafe at {15,22,23,24} -> 16 is safe.\n  turn17: y=5 -> safe (freeway5 always safe)\n  turn18: y=6 -> safe\n  turn19: y=7 -> safe\n  turn20: y=8 -> safe\n  turn21: y=9 -> safe (no freeway)\n\nBut what about the unsafe freeway4 at turns 22,23,24? We are not on freeway4 at those turns.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut we must output the sequence of actions for H=7: \n  a15, a16, a17, a18, a19, a20, a21.\n\nWe have:\n  a15=U -> from y15=3 to y16=4\n  a16=U -> y17=5\n  a17=U -> y18=6\n  a18=U -> y19=7\n  a19=U -> y20=8\n  a20=U -> y21=9\n  a21: we are at y21=9 at the beginning of turn21, so we can choose S to stay? Or we could choose U? But U would go to 10, which is invalid? The update rule: y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. So we cannot choose U. Similarly, D would go to 8. But we don't care as long as at the beginning of turn21 we are at 9. However, the problem doesn't require that we stay. But we must avoid collisions? At turn21 we are at y=9, which is safe. Then if we take D at turn21, we go to y=8 at turn22. But at turn22, we are on freeway8? And freeway8 is always safe? So we could. But the problem only requires that we reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 (which is 21). It doesn't say we must remain.\n\nHowever, the minimal action sequence to get there is the 6 Ups. Then the 7th action can be arbitrary? But we are already at the goal at turn21 (the beginning), so the 7th action doesn't affect the goal. But we must output 7 actions.\n\nWe can choose a21=S to stay at 9.\n\nAlternatively, we might consider if we can get to 9 earlier? But we cannot.\n\nBut wait: what if we go faster? We can only move one step per turn. So no.\n\nBut what about if we take a detour? For example, if we go down? That would take more turns. So not minimal.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7.\n\nBut we must check if there is any obstacle in the next turns? We have freeway4 unsafe at t=22,23,24. But we are not going to be on freeway4 at those turns? We are at y=9 at turn21 and then we take an action at turn21. But after that, we are done. We don't care beyond turn21? The problem only requires that we avoid collisions during the entire sequence until we reach the goal? And we are at the goal at turn21. So we only care from turn15 to turn21.\n\nIn the above, we are safe at every turn from 15 to 21.\n\nBut wait: at turn21, we are at y=9 -> safe. Then we take an action at turn21: but that action affects the state at turn22. But we are not required to avoid collisions at turn22? Because the goal is reached at turn21. The problem says: avoiding collisions ... until we reach (0,9). So we only care until the turn we are at (0,9). \n\nTherefore, we don't care what happens after we reach the goal.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\n  Turn 15: U\n  Turn 16: U\n  Turn 17: U\n  Turn 18: U\n  Turn 19: U\n  Turn 20: U\n  Turn 21: S   (or D? but D would move to 8 at turn22, but we don't care. But the action at turn21 is taken and then we are done. However, during the action at turn21, we are at y=9 at the beginning, then we take an action. The collision check is at the beginning of the turn? \n\nThe problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". And we are at y_T at the beginning of turn T? \n\nYes: because at the beginning of turn T we are at y_T, and then we take an action. The collision condition is checked at the beginning? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So at turn T, you are on y_T (the one from the beginning). \n\nTherefore, the collision check is at the beginning of the turn.\n\nSo at turn21, we are at y=9 -> no collision. Then we take an action (any) and that moves us to turn22. But we don't care about turn22.\n\nSo we can choose any action at turn21: U, D, or S. But U would lead to y=10, which is invalid? The update rule says y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. So we cannot choose U. We can choose D (to 8) or S (to 9). \n\nTo be safe, we can choose S.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose D? But then we leave the goal. But the problem doesn't require to stay. However, to avoid any issue, we choose S.\n\nTherefore, the sequence:\n\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: S\n\nBut wait: we are at turn21 and we output action for turn21. And we are done.\n\nBut let me verify the freeway4 at turn15: we are not on freeway4 at turn15? We are at y=3 at turn15. Then at turn16 we are at y=4 -> freeway4 at turn16: safe.\n\nBut what if we consider that we might be on freeway4 at turn15? We are not. So safe.\n\nBut note: the problem says that at turn15, we start at (0,3). Then we take action a15. Then we update to y16. But during turn15, we are at y=3. So we check freeway3 at turn15: which is safe.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway4 at turn15? It is unsafe. But we are not on it. So safe.\n\nTherefore, we have a plan with H=7.\n\nBut is there a plan with H=6? That would require that we are at (0,9) at turn15+6-1=20. So at turn20 we must be at y=9. \n\nCan we get from y=3 at turn15 to y=9 at turn20? That is 6 units in 5 moves? Because we have 5 actions: at turns15,16,17,18,19. \n\nWe start at y15=3.\nAfter 5 moves (each U): \n  y16=4, y17=5, y18=6, y19=7, y20=8 -> not 9.\n\nTo get to 9 at turn20, we would need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn20. That means we must have arrived at turn20. How? \n  We need 6 moves (each U) to cover 6 units. But we only have 5 moves? \n\nAlternatively, if we move faster? But we can only move one unit per action.\n\nSo impossible. Therefore, H=7 is minimal.\n\nBut note: we might use down moves to avoid an obstacle and then go up? But that would take more moves. So not minimal.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7, and the sequence is:\n\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: S\n\nBut we must check if there is any obstacle that we hit in this path? We already did, but let me double-check freeway4 at turn16: \n\n  Freeway4 at turn16: \n      car1: [ -39 + 4*(16-15) = -39+4 = -35, -28+4 = -24] -> [-35,-24] -> doesn't contain 0 -> safe.\n      car2: [ -3+4=1, 8+4=12] -> [1,12] -> doesn't contain 0 -> safe.\n      car3: [33+4=37,44+4=48] -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut what if we are forced to avoid freeway4 at some other time? We are only on freeway4 at turn16. And it is safe.\n\nBut note: freeway4 is unsafe at turn15 (but we are not on it) and at turns22,23,24 (but we are at y=9 then).\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut wait: what if we do not take the last action (the S) and instead we set H=6? But we cannot because then we are at y=9 at turn21, which is 15+6-1=20? No: 15+6-1=20, but we are at y=9 at turn21, not turn20. So we need H=7.\n\nAlternatively, can we reach y=9 earlier by a different route? For example, if we go up to 4, then down to 3? That would be slower.\n\nOr if we skip freeway4? We have to go through freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8 to get to 9. We start at 3, then 4,5,...8,9. We cannot skip 4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the above sequence.\n\nBut note: the problem says the initial position is (0,3) at turn15. And we are to output the actions starting at turn15.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: S\n}\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". For H=7, t from 0 to 6: \n  t=0: a15\n  t=1: a16\n  ...\n  t=6: a21\n\nSo the above is correct.\n\nBut we could also do D at turn21? But that would move us to 8 at turn22. But we don't care about turn22. However, the problem does not require that we stay at 9. But the update rule: y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. If we choose D at turn21: y22 = 9 - 1 = 8, which is valid. But the goal is already reached at turn21. So it's acceptable. But it's extra. However, to be consistent, we choose S.\n\nBut the problem does not specify that we must stay. So either S or D would be acceptable? But if we choose D, then at turn21 we are at y=9 (safe) and then we move to 8. But the collision check at turn21: we are at y=9 -> safe. Then we take D -> then at turn22 we are at y=8. But we don't care about turn22. So it's safe.\n\nBut why would we choose D? We don't. We choose S to remain at 9.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: S\n\nBut note: we must ensure that at turn21, when we are at y=9, we are safe? Yes, because there is no freeway at y=9.\n\nSo we are done.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"freeways y=1,...,8\". So y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 15\\) is 7. The sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 15, move up (U) to \\(y = 4\\).\n- At turn 16, move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\).\n- At turn 17, move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\).\n- At turn 18, move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\).\n- At turn 19, move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\).\n- At turn 20, move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\).\n- At turn 21, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 21 (which is \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 15 + 7 - 1 = 21\\)) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\):\n\n- At turn 15, \\(y = 3\\): Freeway 3 is safe (unsafe only at turns 26–29).\n- At turn 16, \\(y = 4\\): Freeway 4 is safe (unsafe at turns 15, 22–24; turn 16 is safe).\n- At turns 17–20, \\(y = 5\\) to \\(8\\): Freeways 5–8 are always safe.\n- At turn 21, \\(y = 9\\): No freeway at \\(y = 9\\), so safe.\n\nThe sequence minimizes \\(H\\) as moving directly upward requires 6 moves to cover the vertical distance, arriving at \\(y = 9\\) at turn 21. A sequence of 6 actions would only reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 20, so \\(H = 7\\) is minimal.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: S\n}",

The cars are moving, so I have to consider their positions at each turn based on their speeds and directions.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. For a car, at turn t1, we have its head and tail. For left-moving cars, the span is [h, τ] and it moves left, so the position decreases. For right-moving, it's [τ, h] and it moves right, position increases. In the table, all cars are given with head and tail, and direction.\n\nLooking at the car states:\n\n- Freeway 1: (-27, -38, right, 3) — since direction is right, I think the span is [τ, h] = [-38, -27]? But it says head and tail, and for right-moving, it says span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume.\n\nThe car update says: for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] which should be h > τ since it's moving left, decreasing. Similarly for right, [τ, h] with τ < h, moving right, increasing.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: head = -27, tail = -38, direction right. Since direction is right, the span should be [tail, head] = [-38, -27], I think. But the notation says \"cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\", so for direction right, span is [τ, h] with τ < h? Here tail = -38, head = -27, so τ = -38, h = -27, so [τ, h] = [-38, -27], and it moves right, so at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlso, collision occurs only if at turn T, the player is at y_T, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nMoreover, when moving, at turn T, if you move to y_{T+1}, you are not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1, so at turn T, you are on y_T, and you check collision for freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nThe player position update: at turn t, position y_t, after action a_t, y_{t+1} is set, and at turn t, you are on y_t, so collision check is for freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nThen at turn t, when you take action, you move to y_{t+1}, but at turn t, you are still on y_t.\n\nNow, current turn is t1=17, player at (0,5), so y_{17} = 5.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=5, and need to go to y=9, we need to move up, so actions U will be needed, but we can also move down or stay, but to minimize turns, we probably want to move up as much as possible, but avoiding cars.\n\nThe grid is from y=0 to 9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, no cars there.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so positions (0,0) and (0,9) are safe.\n\nNow, cars are only on y=1 to 8.\n\nWe start at y=5, which is a freeway, so we need to check for cars on y=5 at turn 17.\n\nBut at turn 17, we are at y=5, so we need to ensure that at turn 17, for freeway 5, 0 is not in the span of any car on y=5.\n\nSimilarly for other turns.\n\nFirst, let's find the car positions at turn t1=17.\n\nFor each freeway, list the cars and their spans at t=17.\n\nSince we care about whether 0 is in the span at various turns, I should find for each freeway and each car, when 0 is in the span, i.e., the times when the car covers position 0 on that freeway.\n\nSince the cars are moving at constant speed, I can find the time intervals when each car blocks position 0.\n\nThen for the player, when moving to a freeway row, I need that at that turn, no car on that row has 0 in span.\n\nAlso, since the player moves vertically, and the cars move horizontally, the only danger is when the player is on a freeway row and a car is at x=0 at that same turn.\n\nNow, let's list all cars and their blocking times.\n\nFirst, for a car, at turn T, span is as given.\n\nFor left-moving: span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut since [h, τ] with h > τ for left-moving, so min is τ, max is h.\n\nIn the update, for left-moving: span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] and since h > τ, h - sΔT > τ - sΔT, so the span is from τ - sΔT to h - sΔT, which is decreasing.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] with τ < h, so from τ + sΔT to h + sΔT, increasing.\n\nPosition 0 is blocked when the span covers 0, i.e., min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nFor a given car, I can find the time interval when min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nLet ΔT = T - t1.\n\nFor right-moving car: span(T) = [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT]\n\n0 in span if τ + s ΔT <= 0 <= h + s ΔT\n\nSince τ < h, this is equivalent to:\n\nτ + s ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= h + s ΔT, but since h + s ΔT > τ + s ΔT, it's when:\n\nτ + s ΔT <= 0 <= h + s ΔT\n\nWhich is:\n\n- h <= s ΔT <= -τ  (from 0 <= h + s ΔT and τ + s ΔT <= 0)\n\nFrom τ + s ΔT <= 0: s ΔT <= -τ\n\nFrom 0 <= h + s ΔT: -h <= s ΔT\n\nSo -h <= s ΔT <= -τ\n\nSince τ and h are positions, could be negative.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving.\n\nBut in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving, from the table.\n\nLet's check:\n\nFreeway 1: direction right\n\nFreeway 2: right\n\nFreeway 3: right\n\nFreeway 4: three cars, all right\n\nFreeway 5: two cars, both right\n\nFreeway 6: both right\n\nFreeway 7: both right\n\nFreeway 8: both right\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so I only need to handle right-moving case.\n\nFor a right-moving car with (τ, h, right, s) at t1, span at T is [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT]\n\n0 in span if τ + s ΔT <= 0 <= h + s ΔT\n\nWhich requires τ + s ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= h + s ΔT\n\nSince s > 0, and ΔT >=0, but ΔT can be large.\n\nThe condition:\n\nτ + s ΔT <= 0  => ΔT <= -τ / s  (if τ <0)\n\nAnd h + s ΔT >= 0 => ΔT >= -h / s  (if h <0, -h>0)\n\nSet L = lower bound, U = upper bound for ΔT.\n\nFrom τ + s ΔT <= 0: if τ <=0, then ΔT <= -τ / s\n\nIf τ >0, then τ + s ΔT >0 always for ΔT>=0, so inequality τ + s ΔT <=0 never true if τ>0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= h + s ΔT: if h >=0, always true for ΔT>=0; if h<0, then ΔT >= -h/s\n\nNow, for 0 to be in span, both conditions must hold.\n\nCase 1: if τ <=0 and h >=0, then τ + s ΔT <=0 is true for small ΔT if τ<0, but need to see.\n\nBetter to solve the inequalities.\n\n0 in [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] iff the interval contains 0.\n\nSince the car is moving right, if at some ΔT, the left end τ+sΔT <=0 and right end h+sΔT >=0.\n\nSo the blocking interval for ΔT is from max( ceil( (-h)/s ) , min( floor( (-τ)/s ) ) or something? Since ΔT integer.\n\nΔT is integer, T and t1 are turns, so ΔT integer.\n\ns is speed, integer I assume, from given.\n\nSpeeds are 3,4,12, all integers.\n\nPositions integers.\n\nSo ΔT integer.\n\n0 in span if there exists integer k such that τ + s ΔT <= k <= h + s ΔT for k=0, but position is continuous? No, position is discrete, I think.\n\nThe span is a set of positions? The problem says \"span\" and \"position\", but in the collision, it says \"0 in Span(T)\", and span is given as interval, so I think positions are integer, and span is a contiguous set of integers.\n\nIn the car update, it says \"the car span becomes [a,b]\" and it moves by integer steps, so positions are integers.\n\nSo for a car, span at T is a set of integers from min to max inclusive.\n\nThen 0 in span if min <= 0 <= max.\n\nFor right-moving car, min = τ + s ΔT, max = h + s ΔT.\n\n0 in span if τ + s ΔT <= 0 <= h + s ΔT.\n\nSince integers, this is equivalent to:\n\nτ + s ΔT <= 0 and h + s ΔT >= 0.\n\nAlso, since the span includes all integers from min to max, 0 is included if min <=0 and max>=0.\n\nNow, for each car, find the values of ΔT where this holds.\n\nΔT = T - t1, t1=17.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll compute for each car the range of ΔT where it blocks y=0 on its freeway.\n\nStart with freeway 1:\n\nCar: τ = -38, h = -27, s=3, right\n\nmin = τ + s ΔT = -38 + 3 ΔT\n\nmax = h + s ΔT = -27 + 3 ΔT\n\n0 in span if min <=0 and max>=0\n\nSo -38 + 3 ΔT <= 0 and -27 + 3 ΔT >= 0\n\nFirst: -38 + 3 ΔT <= 0 => 3 ΔT <= 38 => ΔT <= 38/3 = 12.666, so ΔT <= 12 since integer\n\nSecond: -27 + 3 ΔT >= 0 => 3 ΔT >= 27 => ΔT >= 9\n\nSo for ΔT from 9 to 12 inclusive.\n\nΔT=9: min = -38 + 27 = -11 <=0, max = -27 + 27 =0 >=0, yes\n\nΔT=10: min = -38+30=-8<=0, max=-27+30=3>=0\n\nΔT=11: min=-38+33=-5<=0, max=-27+33=6>=0\n\nΔT=12: min=-38+36=-2<=0, max=-27+36=9>=0\n\nΔT=13: min=-38+39=1 >0? 1 <=0? No, min=1 >0, so 0 not <= min, and min>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=8: min=-38+24=-14<=0, max=-27+24=-3 <0, so max<0, 0 not in span.\n\nSo freeway 1 blocked at ΔT=9,10,11,12, i.e., turns T=17+9=26 to 17+12=29.\n\nT = t1 + ΔT = 17 + ΔT.\n\nSo for freeway 1, blocked at T=26,27,28,29.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-27,-38,right,3) but head and tail: it says (-27,-38,right,3), same as freeway 1, so identical, blocked same times T=26 to 29.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3: same, T=26 to 29.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-20, -31, right, 4)? Head and tail: (-20, -31, right, 4)\n\nτ = -31, h = -20? Notation: \"cars (head h, tail τ, ...)\" so for this, head = -20, tail = -31, direction right.\n\nSo τ = tail = -31, h = head = -20.\n\ns=4\n\nmin = τ + s ΔT = -31 + 4 ΔT\n\nmax = h + s ΔT = -20 + 4 ΔT\n\n0 in span if min <=0 and max>=0\n\n-31 + 4 ΔT <=0 => 4 ΔT <=31 => ΔT <= 31/4=7.75, so ΔT <=7\n\n-20 + 4 ΔT >=0 => 4 ΔT >=20 => ΔT >=5\n\nSo ΔT from 5 to 7 inclusive.\n\nΔT=5: min=-31+20=-11<=0, max=-20+20=0>=0\n\nΔT=6: min=-31+24=-7<=0, max=-20+24=4>=0\n\nΔT=7: min=-31+28=-3<=0, max=-20+28=8>=0\n\nΔT=8: min=-31+32=1>0, not <=0\n\nΔT=4: max=-20+16=-4<0, not >=0\n\nSo blocked ΔT=5,6,7 → T=17+5=22 to 17+7=24\n\nSecond car on freeway 4: (16,5,right,4) head=16, tail=5? But direction right, so if tail=5, head=16, then min=τ + sΔT=5 +4ΔT, which is always positive since ΔT>=0, so min >=5>0, so min>0, so 0 never in span because min>0 and increasing.\n\nSimilarly, max=16+4ΔT>0.\n\nSo this car never blocks 0, since it starts at x=5 to 16, all positive, moving right, so always x>=5>0, so 0 not in span ever.\n\nThird car: (52,41,right,4) head=52, tail=41, both positive, min=41+4ΔT >=41>0, so always min>0, 0 never in span.\n\nSo for freeway 4, only the first car blocks, at T=22,23,24.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (36,25,right,12) head=36, tail=25, both positive, min=25+12ΔT >=25>0, so never blocks.\n\nSecond car: (-36,-47,right,12) head=-36, tail=-47? Notation: (-36,-47,right,12) so head=-36, tail=-47.\n\nτ = tail = -47, h = head = -36\n\ns=12\n\nmin = τ + s ΔT = -47 + 12 ΔT\n\nmax = h + s ΔT = -36 + 12 ΔT\n\n0 in span if min <=0 and max>=0\n\n-47 + 12 ΔT <=0 => 12 ΔT <=47 => ΔT <= 47/12=3.916, so ΔT <=3\n\n-36 + 12 ΔT >=0 => 12 ΔT >=36 => ΔT >=3\n\nSo ΔT <=3 and ΔT >=3, so ΔT=3\n\nΔT=3: min=-47+36=-11<=0, max=-36+36=0>=0, yes\n\nΔT=2: min=-47+24=-23<=0, max=-36+24=-12<0, not >=0\n\nΔT=4: min=-47+48=1>0, not <=0\n\nSo only at ΔT=3, T=17+3=20\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5? Cars: (36,25,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (36,25,right,12) never blocks.\n\nSecond car: (-36,-47,right,12) same as above, blocks only at ΔT=3, T=20.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: same cars, so only second car blocks at T=20.\n\nFreeway 8: same, blocks at T=20.\n\nNow, freeways 1,2,3 all block at T=26,27,28,29\n\nFreeway 4 blocks at T=22,23,24\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 all have a car that blocks only at T=20\n\nSpecifically, for y=5,6,7,8, blocked only at T=20.\n\ny=5: freeway 5, blocked at T=20\n\ny=6: freeway 6, blocked at T=20\n\ny=7: freeway 7, blocked at T=20\n\ny=8: freeway 8, blocked at T=20\n\ny=4: freeway 4, blocked at T=22,23,24\n\ny=1,2,3 blocked at T=26,27,28,29\n\nNow, player starts at turn t1=17, position y=5.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe path: we can move up, down, or stay.\n\nBut to minimize turns, we want to move up as much as possible, but avoid being on a freeway row when it is blocked.\n\nAlso, since we start at y=5, and need to go to y=9, we need to cover 4 units up, so minimum 4 moves up if we only go up, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid.\n\nBut going down might not help, since we need to go up eventually.\n\nNow, at turn 17, we are at y=5.\n\nFreeway 5 is blocked at T=20, but at T=17, is it blocked?\n\nFor y=5 at T=17.\n\nAt T=17, ΔT=0.\n\nFor freeway 5, cars: first car min=25+12*0=25>0, max=36>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSecond car min=-47+0=-47<=0? -47<=0 yes, max=-36+0=-36<0? max=-36 <0, so max<0, so 0 not <= max, and max<0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, at T=17, y=5 is safe.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0, but y bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nWe start at y=5.\n\nThe goal is to be at y=9 at some turn H, so after H-1 actions from turn 17.\n\nTurn t1=17, we take action a_{17}, then at turn 18, y_{18} = y_{17} + Δy, and so on.\n\nAfter t actions from start, at turn 17+t, position y_{17+t}, and we take action a_{17+t} at turn 17+t, which determines y_{18+t}, but at turn 17+t, we are at y_{17+t}.\n\nWe want y_{17+H-1} =9 for some H.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nSince we need to go from y=5 to y=9, the minimal number of up moves is 4, so H at least 4, if we go up every turn.\n\nBut we might need to wait or detour if blocked.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can go directly up in 4 turns.\n\nStart turn 17, y=5.\n\nTake action at turn 17: a_{17}, then y_{18} = y_{17} + Δy\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIf we go up each turn:\n\nTurn 17: at y=5, take U, so y_{18} =6\n\nBut at turn 17, we are on y=5, which is safe as above.\n\nTurn 18: we are at y=6, take action.\n\nAt turn 18, y=6, need to check if freeway 6 is blocked at T=18.\n\nT=18, ΔT = T - t1 =18-17=1\n\nFreeway 6: cars, the blocking car is the second one: min = τ + s ΔT = -47 +12*1 = -47+12=-35 <=0? yes, max = h + s ΔT = -36 +12= -24 <0? max=-24<0, so max<0, 0 not in span, since max<0.\n\nSimilarly, other car not blocking.\n\nSo y=6 safe at T=18.\n\nTake U, y_{19}=7\n\nTurn 19: at y=7, check freeway 7 at T=19.\n\nΔT=19-17=2\n\nBlocking car min= -47 +12*2 = -47+24= -23 <=0, max= -36+24= -12 <0, max<0, so 0 not in span. Safe.\n\nTake U, y_{20}=8\n\nTurn 20: at y=8, check freeway 8 at T=20.\n\nΔT=3, min= -47 +12*3= -47+36= -11 <=0, max= -36+36=0 >=0, so 0 in span! Collision.\n\nOh, so at turn 20, if we are on y=8, it is blocked.\n\nWe cannot be on y=8 at turn 20.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 20, y=8, which is blocked.\n\nSo collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot go directly up in 4 turns because turn 20 y=8 is blocked.\n\nNow, H=4 might not be possible.\n\nNext, H=5 or more.\n\nBut we might go slower or wait.\n\nSince y=8 is blocked only at T=20, we can avoid being on y=8 at turn 20.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have blocks at different times.\n\nNow, we start at turn 17 y=5.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible to go up to y=6 or y=7 or y=8, but y=8 at turn 20 is bad.\n\nTurn 20 is ΔT=3, T=20.\n\ny=8 blocked only at T=20.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7 blocked only at T=20, but at T=17,18,19, they are safe? Let's see.\n\ny=5: freeway 5, blocked only at T=20, as above.\n\nAt T=17,18,19: for T=17, ΔT=0, min=-47<0, max=-36<0? max<0, not >=0, so not blocked.\n\nT=18, ΔT=1, min=-35<=0, max=-24<0, not >=0\n\nT=19, ΔT=2, min=-23<=0, max=-12<0, not >=0\n\nT=20, ΔT=3, min=-11<=0, max=0>=0, blocked.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8 same, since same car configuration.\n\ny=6,7,8 all have similar cars? Freeways 5,6,7,8 all have the same: one car that blocks only at T=20, and one that never blocks.\n\nSo for y=5,6,7,8, all are safe except at T=20, when they are all blocked.\n\nAt T=20, all of y=5,6,7,8 are blocked because for each, the second car covers 0 at T=20.\n\ny=4: freeway 4, blocked at T=22,23,24.\n\ny=1,2,3 blocked at T=26,27,28,29.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nNow, back to the player.\n\nStart turn 17, y=5, safe.\n\nWe need to be not on y=5,6,7,8 at turn 20.\n\nTurn 20 is when ΔT=3, T=20.\n\nWe can be on y=0,1,2,3,4,9 at turn 20 to avoid, but y=9 is goal, but we might not be there yet.\n\nAt turn 17, we are at y=5.\n\nWe can take actions.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf we take U at turn 17, go to y=6 at turn 18.\n\nTurn 18: at y=6, safe (since T=18 not 20), then take U, go to y=7 at turn 19.\n\nTurn 19: at y=7, safe, then if take U, go to y=8 at turn 20, but turn 20 y=8 blocked, collision.\n\nSo at turn 19, instead of U, we could take S or D.\n\nIf at turn 19, y=7, take S, then y_{20} =7, but at turn 20, y=7 is blocked, since T=20.\n\nSimilarly, if take D, y_{20}=6, still on 6 at turn 20, blocked.\n\nSo if we go up to y=7 at turn 19, then at turn 19 we must take an action that moves us away from y=7,8, etc., but since we are at y=7, and we take action, if we take U, we go to y=8 at turn 20, which is bad; if S, stay at y=7 at turn 20, bad; if D, go to y=6 at turn 20, bad.\n\nAt turn 19, when we take action, we are at y=7, and after action, y_{20} is set, but at turn 19, we are on y=7, which is safe at T=19.\n\nThen after action, at turn 20, we are on y_{20}, and we check collision at turn 20 for that row.\n\nIf at turn 19 we take U, y_{20}=8, then at turn 20 we are on y=8, which is blocked, collision.\n\nIf take S, y_{20}=7, on y=7 at turn 20, blocked.\n\nIf take D, y_{20}=6, on y=6 at turn 20, blocked.\n\nSo all actions at turn 19 from y=7 lead to collision at turn 20 if we are on row 5-8.\n\nBut we don't have to be at y=7 at turn 19.\n\nWe could be elsewhere.\n\nFor example, at turn 17, instead of going up, we could go down.\n\nBut going down might not be efficient.\n\nWe could go up but slower.\n\nStart turn 17, y=5, take S, stay at y=5 for turn 18.\n\nTurn 18: at y=5, take action.\n\nAt turn 18, y=5 is safe, since not T=20.\n\nThen we can take U to y=6 at turn 19.\n\nTurn 19: at y=6, safe (T=19), then take action.\n\nIf take U to y=7 at turn 20, but y=7 at turn 20 blocked.\n\nIf take S, stay y=6 at turn 20, blocked.\n\nIf take D, to y=5 at turn 20, blocked.\n\nAgain, stuck.\n\nFrom turn 19 y=6, we need to not be on 5-8 at turn 20.\n\nSo we must move to y=4 or y=9 or something.\n\ny=9 is far, or y=4.\n\nBut from y=6, if we take D, to y=5 at turn 20, which is bad.\n\nIf take U, to y=7 at turn 20, bad.\n\nS, to y=6 at turn 20, bad.\n\nSo from y=6 at turn 19, we cannot avoid being on 5-8 at turn 20 unless we can move to y=4 or y=9, but y=4 is down, D would go to y=5, not to 4.\n\nFrom y=6, actions:\n\nU: y_{t+1} =7\n\nD: y_{t+1} =5\n\nS: y_{t+1} =6\n\nAll within 5,6,7, so at next turn, we are on y=5,6, or7, all of which are blocked at turn 20.\n\nBut y=4 is possible? From y=6, D goes to y=5, not directly to y=4.\n\nTo get to y=4, we need to be at y=5 and take D, for example.\n\nBut at turn 19, if we are at y=5, take D, go to y=4 at turn 20.\n\nThen at turn 20, on y=4.\n\nNow, y=4 is freeway 4, which is blocked at T=22,23,24, but at T=20, is it blocked?\n\nT=20, ΔT=20-17=3\n\nFreeway 4: first car, min = τ + s ΔT = -31 +4*3 = -31+12= -19 <=0, max = -20 +12= -8? h=-20, s=4, ΔT=3, max= -20 + 12 = -8 <0, so max<0, 0 not in span.\n\nOther cars not blocking, so y=4 safe at T=20.\n\nSimilarly, y=0,1,2,3,9 safe at T=20.\n\ny=1,2,3 blocked only at later times.\n\nSo at turn 20, we can be on y=4, for example.\n\nSimilarly, y=9.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nTo avoid being on y=5,6,7,8 at turn 20, we need to be at y <=4 or y=9 at turn 20.\n\nBut y=9 might be hard to reach by turn 20.\n\nTurn 20 is turn t1 +3 =17+3=20, so from turn 17 to 20, we have 3 actions: at turn 17,18,19.\n\nStart y=5 at turn 17.\n\nAfter 3 actions, at turn 20, y_{20} depends on the actions.\n\nThe change: each U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\nSo to reach y=9 by turn 20, we need +4 in 3 actions, impossible since max +3 with three U.\n\ny=9 at turn 20: need net +4 from y=5, but in 3 moves, max increase +3, so y<=8 at turn 20.\n\nSimilarly, min y=2 with three D.\n\nSo at turn 20, possible y from 2 to 8.\n\ny=0 to 9 possible, but from start, in 3 actions, y can be from 5-3=2 to 5+3=8.\n\nSo y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8 possible at turn 20.\n\nBut y=5,6,7,8 are all blocked at turn 20, so we must be at y=2,3, or4 at turn 20 to be safe.\n\ny=2,3,4 are freeways, but at T=20, they are not blocked, as per earlier.\n\ny=4: freeway 4, safe at T=20.\n\ny=3: freeway 3, blocked at T=26-29, not at 20.\n\nSimilarly y=2, same.\n\ny=1, same.\n\nBut y=2,3,4 are safe at T=20.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 eventually.\n\nSo one plan: go down to y=4 or lower by turn 20, then go up after.\n\nBut going down might take extra turns.\n\nSince we need to reach y=9, and turn 20 is a problem for rows 5-8, we can be on a safe row at turn 20, then proceed up.\n\nNow, minimal H.\n\nIf we can reach y=9 by turn 20, but impossible, as y<=8.\n\nTurn 20 is turn 17+3, so after 3 actions, we are at turn 20, y_{20} <=8.\n\nThen from there, we need to go to y=9.\n\nSo at least one more action.\n\nH min could be 4 or 5, but H=4 not possible as we saw earlier.\n\nH is the number of turns including start? Let's see.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAt turn t1, we start, take action a_{t1}, then a_{t1+1}, ..., up to a_{t1 + H-1}, and at turn t1 + H -1, we reach y=9.\n\nSo from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -1, there are H-1 actions.\n\nAt turn t1, we are at position, then we take H actions? No.\n\nSequence of actions from t=0 to H-1, so indices t1 to t1+H-1, H actions.\n\nBut after H actions, we are at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut we need to reach at turn t1 + H -1? Let's read.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nAfter taking a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1, we have y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy, but we need y_{t1+H-1} =9? No.\n\nThe position at turn t is before action or after?\n\nTypically, at turn t, we are at position, take action, then move to new position for next turn.\n\nSo at turn t, position y_t, take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nWe need that at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nThe turn when we reach is T = t1 + H -1, with y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nAnd we take actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, which determine the moves.\n\nFor example, to reach in min turns.\n\nFrom y=5 to y=9, min actions: 4 U, so H=4, reach at turn t1+3? Let's index.\n\nt1=17, start at y_{17}=5.\n\nTake a_{17}: U, then y_{18}=6\n\na_{18}: U, y_{19}=7\n\na_{19}: U, y_{20}=8\n\na_{20}: U, y_{21}=9\n\nSo at turn 21, y=9, so T=21.\n\nH: actions from t=0 to H-1, so a_{17} to a_{17+H-1}\n\nReach at turn (17 + H -1)\n\nSet T = 17 + H -1, y_T=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, T=21, so 17 + H -1 =21, so H-1=4, H=5.\n\nActions: a_{17}, a_{18}, a_{19}, a_{20}, so 4 actions, H=5 turns? Turns: turn 17,18,19,20,21, but at turn 17 we start, after 4 actions, at turn 21.\n\nNumber of turns from start to end: turns 17 to 21 inclusive, 5 turns, but the action sequence is for turns 17 to 20, H actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAnd reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nFor min H, with no obstacles, H=5, actions U,U,U,U, reach at turn 21.\n\nBut with obstacles, we might take more.\n\nIn this case, with obstacles, at turn 20, if we are at y=8, it might be blocked, but in the sequence above, at turn 20, we are at y=8, but if we take action at turn 20 to go to y=9 at turn 21.\n\nBut at turn 20, when we are at y=8, we need to check if it is safe to be there, but in this case, for freeway 8, at T=20, it is blocked, so if we are on y=8 at turn 20, collision, cannot take action.\n\nIn the sequence: at turn 20, position y_{20}=8, then we take action a_{20}, but before taking action, we are at y_{20}=8, and if freeway 8 is blocked at turn 20, collision occurs, game over, cannot proceed.\n\nSo we cannot be on a blocked row at any turn, including when we are about to take action.\n\nIn the direct up, at turn 20, y=8 blocked, so we get collision before taking action.\n\nThus, that sequence doesn't work.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need to avoid being on blocked rows at the turn we are there.\n\nBack to plan.\n\nWe need to be at y=2,3, or4 at turn 20 to avoid collision.\n\nThen from there, go up to 9.\n\nBut y=4 might be good.\n\nFirst, go to y=4 by turn 20.\n\nTurn 20 is T=20.\n\nFrom turn 17 y=5 to turn 20.\n\n3 actions: at turn 17,18,19.\n\nWe need y_{20} <=4.\n\ny_{20} = y_{17} + sum of Δy from t=17 to 19.\n\ny_{17}=5\n\nAfter a_{17}, y_{18} =5 + Δy_{17}\n\nThen a_{18}, y_{19} = y_{18} + Δy_{18}\n\nThen a_{19}, y_{20} = y_{19} + Δy_{19}\n\nWe need y_{20} <=4.\n\nAlso, during, at each turn, we need to be safe.\n\nFor example, one way: at turn 17, take D, so y_{18}=4\n\nThen at turn 18, at y=4, take action.\n\nBut y=4 is freeway 4, which at T=18, is it safe?\n\nT=18, ΔT=1, freeway 4: first car min=-31+4*1=-27<=0, max=-20+4=-16<0, so max<0, 0 not in span, safe.\n\nThen at turn 18, we can take S, for example, so y_{19}=4\n\nThen at turn 19, at y=4, take action.\n\nT=19, ΔT=2, freeway 4: min=-31+8=-23<=0, max=-20+8=-12<0, safe.\n\nThen take S again, y_{20}=4\n\nOr take D, y_{20}=3, etc.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nAt turn 20, y_{20}=4, safe.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y=4 to y=9, need +5, so min 5 actions: U,U,U,U,U.\n\nBut we can do it in fewer if we start from here.\n\nBut let's see the turns.\n\nAfter turn 20, we need to reach y=9.\n\nTurn 20: at y=4, take action.\n\nIf we take U, y_{21}=5, then at turn 21, y=5.\n\nTurn 21, ΔT=21-17=4, T=21.\n\nFreeway 5 at T=21: the blocking car, min=-47+12*4= -47+48=1>0, so min>0, not <=0, so 0 not in span. Similarly, safe.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nHowever, there are other blockages, like y=4 blocked at T=22,23,24.\n\nT=22, ΔT=5, freeway 4: min=-31+4*5= -31+20= -11<=0, max=-20+20=0>=0, so blocked at T=22.\n\nSimilarly T=23,24.\n\nSo at turn 22, if on y=4, blocked.\n\nWe need to not be on y=4 at turn 22,23,24.\n\nSimilarly, y=1,2,3 blocked later.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nFrom turn 20, y=4, we can start going up.\n\nBut to avoid y=4 at turn 22.\n\nTurn 20: at y=4, take U, to y=5 at turn 21.\n\nTurn 21: at y=5, safe (T=21, not blocked), take U, to y=6 at turn 22.\n\nTurn 22: at y=6, need to check.\n\nT=22, ΔT=5, freeway 6: the blocking car min=-47+12*5= -47+60=13>0, so min>0, not blocked. Safe.\n\nTake U, to y=7 at turn 23.\n\nTurn 23: at y=7, T=23, ΔT=6, min=-47+72=25>0, safe.\n\nTake U, to y=8 at turn 24.\n\nTurn 24: at y=8, T=24, ΔT=7, min=-47+84=37>0, safe.\n\nTake U, to y=9 at turn 25.\n\nSo at turn 25, y=9.\n\nNow, number of actions: from turn 17 to 24, actions a_{17} to a_{24}, that's 8 actions? Turns: actions at t=17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24 for H=8? Let's count.\n\nStart: turn 17, y=5.\n\nAction sequence:\n\nTurn 17: D (to y=4 at turn 18)\n\nIn the sequence above, I had:\n\nFirst part: to be at y=4 at turn 20.\n\nIn my earlier, I did:\n\nTurn 17: D, so a_{17}=D, then y_{18}=4\n\nTurn 18: at y=4, I said take S, but to minimize, we can take U or something, but at turn 18, if we take U, y_{19}=5, but then at turn 19, y=5, which is safe at T=19, but then at turn 19, if we take D to go to y=4 at turn 20, for example.\n\nBut let's make the sequence for being at y=4 at turn 20.\n\nOne way:\n\nTurn 17: take D, so a_{17}=D, y_{18}=4\n\nThen turn 18: at y=4, take S, a_{18}=S, y_{19}=4\n\nThen turn 19: at y=4, take S, a_{19}=S, y_{20}=4\n\nNow at turn 20, y=4.\n\nThen turn 20: take U, a_{20}=U, y_{21}=5\n\nTurn 21: take U, a_{21}=U, y_{22}=6\n\nTurn 22: take U, a_{22}=U, y_{23}=7\n\nTurn 23: take U, a_{23}=U, y_{24}=8\n\nTurn 24: take U, a_{24}=U, y_{25}=9\n\nSo at turn 25, y=9.\n\nActions from a_{17} to a_{24}, that's 8 actions.\n\nH: actions from t=0 to H-1, so indices 17 to 17+H-1.\n\nSet t1=17, actions a_{17} to a_{17+H-1}, reach at turn (17+H-1) with y=9.\n\nHere turn 25 = 17 + H -1, so 17+H-1=25, H-1=8, H=9? 17+H-1=25, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nTurns: from 17 to 25, that's 9 turns, but actions at 17 to 24, 8 actions.\n\nReach at turn 25.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nIn the above, we wasted some actions staying or going down.\n\nSince we need to be at y<=4 at turn 20, we can go directly to y=4 quickly and then up.\n\nBut from y=5 to y=4, we can go in one down action.\n\nThen at turn 20, we are at y=4.\n\nThen from y=4 to y=9, 5 up actions, but we need to avoid the blockage on y=4 at later turns.\n\nIn the sequence above, when we go up from turn 20, at turn 21 y=5, turn 22 y=6, etc., we avoided y=4 at turn 22.\n\nBut we can go faster.\n\nAnother idea: instead of going down, we can go up but skip the turn 20 blockage.\n\nFor example, at turn 17, take U to y=6 at turn 18.\n\nTurn 18: take U to y=7 at turn 19.\n\nNow at turn 19, y=7, we need to not be on 5-8 at turn 20.\n\nBut from y=7, if we take D, to y=6 at turn 20, which is bad; U to y=8 bad; S to y=7 bad.\n\nWe cannot go to y=4 directly.\n\nUnless we go down multiple times, but that might take more turns.\n\nAt turn 19, y=7, take D to y=6 at turn 20, but y=6 at turn 20 blocked, not good.\n\nSo we must be at a different row at turn 20.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 by turn 20, but impossible.\n\nOr y=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nBut from y=7 at turn 19, we can only go to y=6,7,8 at turn 20.\n\nSo we cannot reach y=4 from y=7 in one action.\n\nTherefore, to be at y=4 at turn 20, we need to be at y=4 or y=5 at turn 19.\n\nIf at turn 19 y=4, take S or D or U, but to stay at y=4 or go to y=3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo to have y_{20} <=4, we need to be at y<=4 at turn 19 and take S or D to stay or decrease, or at y=5 and take D to y=4.\n\nBut at turn 19, if at y=5, and take D, to y=4 at turn 20.\n\nAt turn 19, y=5, is it safe? T=19, ΔT=2, y=5 safe as before.\n\nThen take D, y_{20}=4.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 19 y=4, take S, y_{20}=4, or D to y=3, etc.\n\nBut for min turns, we can go to y=4 at turn 20 with fewer down actions.\n\nStart turn 17 y=5.\n\nTake D at turn 17, y_{18}=4\n\nThen at turn 18, y=4, we can take S to keep at 4 for turn 19, or U to y=5, but if we go to y=5 at turn 19, then at turn 19 take D to y=4 at turn 20.\n\nBut that takes an extra move.\n\nBetter to stay at y=4.\n\nAt turn 18, y=4, take S, y_{19}=4\n\nThen turn 19, take S, y_{20}=4\n\nOr at turn 18, take U to y=5, then turn 19 take D to y=4, which is worse.\n\nSo best to go directly to y=4 and stay there until turn 20.\n\nBut we don't need to stay, we can go up after, but to avoid turn 20, we just need to be at y=4 at turn 20.\n\nFrom turn 18 y=4, we can start going up, but if we go up, at turn 19 y=5, then turn 19 take action to go to y=4 at turn 20, which requires taking D at turn 19, so we go down again, inefficient.\n\nSo to minimize actions, it's better to stay at y=4 for turns 18,19,20, then go up from there.\n\nBut at turn 20 we go up.\n\nNow, from y=4 at turn 20, to y=9.\n\nMin 5 actions: U,U,U,U,U to y=5,6,7,8,9 at turns 21,22,23,24,25.\n\nBut as before, at turn 22, if we are on y=4? No, at turn 20 y=4, take U, turn 21 y=5, turn 22 y=6, etc., not on y=4 at turn 22, so safe.\n\nBut we can reach faster if we start from higher.\n\nAnother idea: since y=8 is only blocked at turn 20, we can be on y=8 at other times.\n\nFor example, at turn 17, take U to y=6 at turn 18.\n\nThen turn 18 take U to y=7 at turn 19.\n\nThen at turn 19, instead of going to y=8, we can stay or something, but we have to deal with turn 20.\n\nAt turn 19, y=7, we must move to a safe row for turn 20, but we can only go to y=6,7,8, all bad.\n\nUnless we can go to y=9, but from y=7, U to y=8, not 9.\n\nSo impossible from there.\n\nWe need to be at y=4 or below by turn 20.\n\ny=3 or 2 also possible.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach y=9 sooner.\n\nMin H: since we must spend at least 4 up actions, but with the detour, we have some down or stay.\n\nIn the sequence with one down and then up, we have one down and five up, but the down is necessary to avoid.\n\nTotal actions: to go from 5 to 4, then 4 to 9, net +4, but with the down, we have one extra action, so 5 up and one down, but the down and some up might be at the same time, but in this case, we have actions: D, S, S for the first part, then U,U,U,U,U, that's 8 actions, H=9 for the turn.\n\nBut we can reduce the stay actions.\n\nFor example, at turn 17, take D to y=4 at turn 18.\n\nThen at turn 18, at y=4, instead of staying, we can take U to y=5 at turn 19.\n\nBut at turn 19, y=5, we need to go to y=4 or lower at turn 20.\n\nSo take D at turn 19 to y=4 at turn 20.\n\nThen at turn 20, y=4.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut sequence:\n\nTurn 17: D, y_{18}=4\n\nTurn 18: U, y_{19}=5\n\nTurn 19: D, y_{20}=4\n\nTurn 20: U, y_{21}=5\n\nTurn 21: U, y_{22}=6\n\nTurn 22: U, y_{23}=7\n\nTurn 23: U, y_{24}=8\n\nTurn 24: U, y_{25}=9\n\nSame as before, 8 actions, reach turn 25.\n\nBut at turn 19, we took D from y=5 to y=4, which is a wasted move.\n\nWorse than staying at y=4.\n\nAt turn 18, take S to stay at y=4 for turn 19, then turn 19 take S to stay for turn 20, then turn 20 take U.\n\nBut that's two stay actions, which are unnecessary for vertical progress.\n\nBut to avoid the blockage, we need to be at low y at turn 20, so we have to spend time there or move down.\n\nThe fastest way is to go to y=4 immediately and stay until after turn 20, then go up.\n\nBut since we go up after turn 20, and turn 20 is passed, we can go up immediately from turn 20.\n\nBut from y=4, it takes 5 up actions.\n\nWe can be at y=3 or 2 at turn 20, but that might be worse.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=8 before turn 20 or after, but not at turn 20.\n\nFor example, at turn 17, take U to y=6 at turn 18.\n\nTurn 18 take U to y=7 at turn 19.\n\nThen at turn 19, we cannot go to y=8 because at turn 20 it would be bad if we stay, but we can go to y=8 at turn 19? At turn 19, y=7, take U to y=8 at turn 20, but that's bad.\n\nTake no action, but still at y=7 or 8.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nPerhaps go down at some point.\n\nTurn 17: take S, y_{18}=5\n\nTurn 18: take D, y_{19}=4\n\nTurn 19: take S, y_{20}=4\n\nThen same as before.\n\nOr turn 17: D, y_{18}=4\n\nTurn 18: S, y_{19}=4\n\nTurn 19: U, but if turn 19 take U, y_{20}=5, which is bad at turn 20.\n\nSo at turn 19, we must have y_{20} <=4, so if at turn 19 y=4, take S or D to stay or decrease, not U.\n\nSo we need to take S or D at turn 19 if at y=4.\n\nTo save time, at turn 20 we can go up.\n\nBut let's accept that we need to be at low y at turn 20.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nBut we can go up faster after.\n\nNotice that y=5,6,7,8 are only blocked at turn 20, so at other times, they are safe.\n\nSo we can be on them at turn 17,18,19,21,etc.\n\nFor example, at turn 17, take U to y=6 at turn 18.\n\nTurn 18 take U to y=7 at turn 19.\n\nThen at turn 19, we are at y=7, safe.\n\nNow, for turn 20, we need to be not on 5-8.\n\nBut we can only move to adjacent rows.\n\nSo from y=7 at turn 19, we can go to y=6,7,8 at turn 20, all bad.\n\nSo impossible to avoid from there.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y<=4 at turn 19 or something.\n\nAt turn 19, if we are at y=4, then we can be at y=4 at turn 20 by taking S, or y=3 by D, etc.\n\nIf at turn 19 y=5, take D to y=4 at turn 20.\n\nBut to be at y=4 at turn 19, we need to have gone down earlier.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 17: take D, y_{18}=4\n\nTurn 18: take S, y_{19}=4  (or U, but if U, y_{19}=5, then need D at turn 19)\n\nBut taking S at turn 18 is better than U then D.\n\nWith S, we stay, no progress.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to make progress later.\n\nNow, the minimal H.\n\nSince we must have at least 4 net up actions, and we need one down action to go to y=4, so total at least 5 actions, but with the stay, it might be more.\n\nLet's list the actions without stay.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 17: D, to y=4 at turn 18\n\nTurn 18: S, to y=4 at turn 19  -- but S is no progress\n\nTurn 19: S, to y=4 at turn 20  -- another S\n\nThen turn 20: U, to y=5 at turn 21\n\nTurn 21: U, to y=6 at turn 22\n\nTurn 22: U, to y=7 at turn 23\n\nTurn 23: U, to y=8 at turn 24\n\nTurn 24: U, to y=9 at turn 25\n\n8 actions, reach at turn 25.\n\nBut at turn 18, we can take U to y=5 at turn 19, then at turn 19 take D to y=4 at turn 20.\n\nThen:\n\nTurn 17: D, y18=4\n\nTurn 18: U, y19=5\n\nTurn 19: D, y20=4\n\nTurn 20: U, y21=5\n\nTurn 21: U, y22=6\n\nTurn 22: U, y23=7\n\nTurn 23: U, y24=8\n\nTurn 24: U, y25=9\n\nSame number, 8 actions, but we have an extra down and up that cancel, so same as having two stays.\n\nWorse.\n\nAt turn 18, after y=4, we can take D to go lower, but that might not help.\n\nFor example, to y=3, then we need to come back up, more actions.\n\nSo not better.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 by turn 21 or earlier with a different path.\n\nTurn 21 is t1+4, since t1=17, turn 21=17+4.\n\nIf we can be at y=9 at turn 21, then 17+H-1=21, H-1=4, H=5.\n\nActions: 4 actions from turn 17 to 20.\n\nBut with 4 actions, from y=5, possible y at turn 21: min y=1, max y=9.\n\nTo reach y=9, need +4 in 4 actions, so all U, but with obstacles.\n\nIf all U: turn 17 U, y18=6\n\nTurn 18 U, y19=7\n\nTurn 19 U, y20=8\n\nTurn 20 U, y21=9\n\nBut at turn 20, when we are at y=8, it is blocked, so we cannot be there to take the action; collision at turn 20.\n\nIf we take different actions.\n\nFor example, to avoid being on y=8 at turn 20.\n\nBut at turn 20, we are at y_{20}, which for this sequence is y=8.\n\nWe can have y_{20} lower.\n\nFor example, turn 17 U, y18=6\n\nTurn 18 U, y19=7\n\nThen at turn 19, instead of U, take D, so y20=6\n\nThen at turn 20, take U, y21=7\n\nBut y=6 at turn 20 blocked.\n\nNot good.\n\nTurn 17 U, y18=6\n\nTurn 18 D, y19=5\n\nTurn 19 D, y20=4\n\nThen turn 20 U, y21=5\n\nNot y=9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 21, we need y_{21}=9, which requires that after 4 actions, net +4, so all U, but then y20=8, which is blocked.\n\nIf we have some down, net less than +4, cannot reach y=9.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 at turn 21.\n\nSimilarly, turn 22: 17+H-1=22, H-1=5, H=6, with 5 actions.\n\nPossible to reach with 5 actions? Net +4, so one S or D, but S or D means net less than +4, so y<=8 at turn 22.\n\nWith 5 actions, from y=5, max y=10, but capped at 9, so can reach y=9.\n\nFor example, actions: U,U,U,U,U, but then at turn 20 y=8 blocked if we go straight.\n\nBut with detour.\n\nFor example, to avoid turn 20 blockage.\n\nTurn 17: D, to y=4 at turn 18\n\nTurn 18: U, to y=5 at turn 19\n\nTurn 19: U, to y=6 at turn 20\n\nBut at turn 20, y=6 blocked, collision.\n\nTurn 17: U, to y=6 at turn 18\n\nTurn 18: D, to y=5 at turn 19\n\nTurn 19: D, to y=4 at turn 20\n\nThen turn 20: U, to y=5 at turn 21\n\nTurn 21: U, to y=6 at turn 22\n\nNot at 9.\n\nTo reach at turn 22, we need y_{22}=9.\n\nFrom turn 20 y=4, take U,U,U to y=7 at turn 23, not 22.\n\nWith 5 actions from turn 17.\n\nActions a17 to a21 for turn 22 reach.\n\ny22 = y17 + sum Δy from t=17 to 21.\n\n5 actions.\n\nTo have y22=9, need sum Δy = +4.\n\nSo four U and one other action: S or D.\n\nIf S, then four U and one S, but the S doesn't help vertical.\n\nPositions: start y17=5\n\nAfter a17, y18\n\na18, y19\n\na19, y20\n\na20, y21\n\na21, y22\n\nWe need y22=9.\n\nAlso, at each turn, safe.\n\nNow, at turn 20, we need y20 <=4 or y20=9, but y20=9 impossible with actions so far.\n\nWith 3 actions from start, y20 <=8, so y20 <=4 for safety.\n\nSimilarly, y20 must be 2,3,4.\n\nThen from there, to y22=9, need +5 or more, but with two actions, max +2, so impossible to reach y=9 from y<=4 in two actions.\n\nContradiction.\n\ny22 = y20 + Δy20 + Δy21\n\ny20 <=4, Δy20 <=1, Δy21 <=1, so y22 <=6 <9, cannot reach y=9 at turn 22 if y20 <=4.\n\nIf we are at y=5 at turn 20, but y=5 blocked at turn 20, cannot.\n\nSimilarly, y=6,7,8 blocked.\n\nSo at turn 20, we cannot be on y=5,6,7,8, and y=9 impossible, so must be on y=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nThen y20 <=4.\n\nThen y22 <= y20 +2 <=6 <9, so impossible to reach y=9 at turn 22.\n\nSimilarly, for turn 23: 17+H-1=23, H-1=6, H=7, with 6 actions.\n\ny23=9 possible.\n\ny20 <=4, then from y20, with 3 actions to y23, can go to y20+3=7, but 7<9, not enough.\n\ny23 = y20 + Δy20 + Δy21 + Δy22\n\ny20 <=4, each Δy <=1, so y23 <=7 <9.\n\nCannot reach y=9.\n\nTurn 24: 17+H-1=24, H-1=7, H=8, 7 actions.\n\ny24=9.\n\ny20 <=4, then y24 = y20 + Δy20 to Δy23, 4 actions, max +4, so y24 <=8 <9, still not, because y20 <=4, y24 <=8.\n\ny20 <=4, after 4 actions, y24 <=8.\n\nBut we need y24=9, so if y20=4, then need exactly +5 in 4 actions, impossible, max +4.\n\nIf y20=3, max y24=7, worse.\n\nSo to reach y=9 at turn 24, we need y20 >=5, but y20 cannot be 5,6,7,8 at turn 20, must be <=4, so y20<=4, then y24 <= y20 +4 <=8<9, impossible.\n\nTurn 25: 17+H-1=25, H-1=8, H=9, 8 actions.\n\ny25=9.\n\ny20 <=4, then with 5 actions, y25 = y20 + sum Δy20 to Δy24, 5 actions, max +5, so if y20=4, can reach y=9.\n\nSimilarly, if lower, also possible.\n\nSo the earliest possible is turn 25 with H=9.\n\nIn the sequence I had earlier, we reach at turn 25.\n\nBut can we do it with fewer actions?\n\nFor example, by not staying at y=4.\n\nTurn 17: D, y18=4\n\nThen turn 18: U, but y19=5\n\nThen turn 19: D, y20=4  (to avoid)\n\nThen turn 20: U, y21=5\n\nTurn 21: U, y22=6\n\nTurn 22: U, y23=7\n\nTurn 23: U, y24=8\n\nTurn 24: U, y25=9\n\nSame as before, 8 actions to reach turn 25.\n\nBut at turn 18, we took U to y=5, then at turn 19 took D back to y=4, which is two actions for no net progress.\n\nWorse than taking S at turn 18 and turn 19.\n\nIn the stay case, we take S at turn 18 and S at turn 19, then U from turn 20.\n\nBut with S, we are not moving, so the vertical progress is delayed.\n\nHowever, in terms of number of actions, it's the same for reaching at turn 25.\n\nBut we can start going up earlier.\n\nFor example, after turn 17 D to y=4, at turn 18 we are at y=4, safe.\n\nThen at turn 18, we can take U to y=5 at turn 19.\n\nBut at turn 19, y=5, which is safe at T=19 (ΔT=2), then at turn 19, we need to set y20 to low.\n\nBut if we take U at turn 19, y20=6, blocked.\n\nTake D, y20=4, safe.\n\nThen from y=4 at turn 20, we go up.\n\nBut we lost the progress from y=5 to y=4.\n\nSo net, from turn 18 y=4 to turn 20 y=4, no progress.\n\nWhereas if we stay at y=4 for turns 18 and 19, we are at same position.\n\nThen from turn 20 y=4, we go up to y=9 in 5 actions.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at turn 25.\n\nNow, the only way to reduce is to be at a higher y after turn 20.\n\nBut since we must be at y<=4 at turn 20, and from there min 5 actions to y=9, so turn 25 is earliest.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=4 at turn 20, but then go up faster, but no, min 5 actions.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=9 directly after turn 20, but from y=4, it takes time.\n\nOr, since y=1,2,3 are safe except at later turns, we can go through them, but it might not save time.\n\nFor example, from y=4 at turn 20, take U to y=5 at turn 21, then U to y=6 at turn 22, etc., as before.\n\nNo shortcut.\n\nSo minimal H is 9, with reach at turn 25.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we can have fewer stay actions.\n\nFor example, at turn 17, take D to y=4 at turn 18.\n\nThen at turn 18, take S to y=4 at turn 19. (or we can take D to y=3, but not necessary)\n\nBut let's keep y=4.\n\nThen at turn 19, take S to y=4 at turn 20. (must, to avoid going up)\n\nThen at turn 20, take U to y=5 at turn 21.\n\nTurn 21: take U to y=6 at turn 22.\n\nTurn 22: take U to y=7 at turn 23.\n\nTurn 23: take U to y=8 at turn 24.\n\nTurn 24: take U to y=9 at turn 25.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 17: D\n\nTurn 18: S\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nAt turn 25, y=9.\n\nBut we can avoid some S by going down and up, but not better.\n\nAt turn 18, after y=4, we can take no action, but S is fine.\n\nIn the action, S is \"stay\", which is allowed.\n\nTo make it with only U and D, but not necessary.\n\nBut in this case, with two S, it works.\n\nWe can have only one S.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 17: D, to y=4 at turn 18\n\nThen turn 18: we must be at y=4 at turn 20, so if we take U at turn 18, to y=5 at turn 19, then turn 19 take D to y=4 at turn 20.\n\nThen actions:\n\nTurn 17: D\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nSame number of actions, but we have extra U and D that cancel.\n\nIn terms of reaching turn 25, same.\n\nBut in this sequence, at turn 19 we take D from y=5 to y=4, which might be risk if there is blockage, but at T=19, y=5 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut both sequences have 8 actions.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need the minimal H, which is 9.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose we go to y=3 at turn 20.\n\nThen from y=3 to y=9, need +6, min 6 actions, reach at turn 26, worse.\n\nSimilarly, not better.\n\nGo to y=4 at turn 19, but then at turn 19 y=4, we can go up to y=5 at turn 20, but y=5 at turn 20 blocked, not possible.\n\nSo we must have y<=4 at turn 20.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to output the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at some turns, we might have choices, but to minimize H, we go up directly after turn 20.\n\nIn the sequence above, after turn 20, we go up continuously, which should be fine, as other rows are safe at those times.\n\nFor example, at turn 21 y=5, T=21, not blocked.\n\nTurn 22 y=6, T=22, not blocked, as earlier.\n\nTurn 23 y=7, safe.\n\nTurn 24 y=8, safe.\n\nThen to y=9.\n\ny=9 no issue.\n\nAre there any other blockages?\n\nFor example, y=4 is blocked at T=22,23,24, but in our sequence, we are not on y=4 at those times; at turn 22, we are at y=6, etc.\n\nSimilarly, y=1,2,3 blocked at T=26-29, later.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, one possible sequence is:\n\nTurn 17: D\n\nTurn 18: S\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nBut we have actions up to turn 24, and reach at turn 25.\n\nH=9, actions from t=0 to 8? t from 0 to H-1=8, so 9 actions: a_{17} to a_{25}? No.\n\nt1=17, actions a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo a_{17+0} = a_{17}, a_{17+1}=a_{18}, ..., a_{17+H-1}\n\nReach at turn (17 + H -1)\n\nWith H=9, reach at turn 17+9-1=25.\n\nActions: a_{17} to a_{25}? a_{17} to a_{17+8} = a_{25}? 17+8=25, a_{25} is the action at turn 25.\n\nBut at turn 25, we reach y=9, so we don't take action at turn 25.\n\nAfter taking a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1, we have position at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, after a_{24} at turn 24, y_{25}=9.\n\nSo actions up to a_{24}, for t from 0 to 8? t=0 to H-1=8, so a_{17} to a_{17+8}=a_{25}? Inconsistency.\n\nSet t from 0 to H-1.\n\nFor H=9, t=0 to 8.\n\na_{t1 + t} for t=0 to 8.\n\nt1=17, so a_{17}, a_{18}, a_{19}, a_{20}, a_{21}, a_{22}, a_{23}, a_{24}, a_{25}?\n\nBut that's 9 actions, from turn 17 to 25.\n\nBut at turn 25, we take action a_{25}, which sets y_{26}, but we need to reach at turn 25 with y_{25}=9.\n\nIf we take action at turn 25, it affects y_{26}, but y_{25} is before the action.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nWe need y_T =9 for T= t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter taking a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1, y_{t1+H-1} is already set, and we need it to be 9.\n\nThe last action is at turn t1+H-1.\n\nFor example, with H=5, actions a_{17},a_{18},a_{19},a_{20}, then y_{21} should be 9.\n\nIn general, with H actions, from a_{17} to a_{17+H-1}, and y_{17+H} might not be 9, but we need y_{17+H-1}=9.\n\nIn the sequence, after last action at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nIn our case, with actions up to turn 24, y_{25}=9.\n\nSo T=25, t1+H-1=25, t1=17, so 17+H-1=25, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions: a_{17} to a_{24}? a_{17} to a_{17+8} = a_{25}, no.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so for t=0, a_{17+0}=a_{17}\n\nt=1, a_{18}\n\n...\n\nt=8, a_{17+8}=a_{25}\n\nBut a_{25} is action at turn 25, which sets y_{26}, but we need y_{25}=9.\n\nIf we take action at turn 25, it is to set y_{26}, but y_{25} is the position before action.\n\nTo have y_{25}=9, we should not take action at turn 25 if we are already at 9.\n\nThe sequence should end with the action that brings us to 9 or we are at 9.\n\nIn the definition, we take actions until we reach.\n\nIn the sequence {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, and after H actions, at turn t1 + H -1, we are at y=9.\n\nFor example, with no obstacles: start turn 17 y=5.\n\na_{17}=U, y_{18}=6\n\na_{18}=U, y_{19}=7\n\na_{19}=U, y_{20}=8\n\na_{20}=U, y_{21}=9\n\nSo at turn 21, y=9, so T=21, t1+H-1=21, 17+H-1=21, H-1=4, H=5.\n\nActions a_{17} to a_{20}, 4 actions for H=5.\n\nIn general, H turns from start to end, but H is the number of turns including start or what?\n\n\"minimal number of turns H\" and \"sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nSo for H, there are H actions, from t=0 to H-1.\n\nReach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nIn our case, with H=9, reach at turn 17+9-1=25.\n\nActions: a_{17} to a_{17+8} = a_{25}? a_{17} to a_{24}, since t from 0 to 8, a_{17+0} to a_{17+8}=a_{25}, but a_{25} is for turn 25.\n\nBut at turn 25, if we take action, we are at y_{25}, take a_{25}, set y_{26}.\n\nBut we need y_{25}=9, so if we take action at turn 25, it means we are not at 9 yet or something.\n\nI think I have confusion.\n\nLet me read the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nSo at turn t1 + H -1, we reach (0,9).\n\nThe sequence has H actions, taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., up to t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, action at t1, reach at turn t1? But after action, position changes.\n\nIf H=1, action at t1, then y_{t1+1} is set, but we need y_{t1} =9? Not necessarily.\n\nWith one action, we take a_{t1} at turn t1, which determines y_{t1+1}, but we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor H=1, reach at turn t1 +1 -1 = t1, so y_{t1}=9.\n\nBut at turn t1, we are at position, before action. If we are already at 9, we don't need action, but the sequence might be empty, but H=0 not considered.\n\nIn this case, we start at y=5, not 9.\n\nSo for min H to reach.\n\nIn our case, with actions, we need to specify.\n\nFor the sequence to reach at turn T= t1 + H -1.\n\nIn the action list, the last action is at turn T.\n\nAfter taking a_T at turn T, y_{T+1} might be set, but we need y_T=9.\n\nAt turn T, we take action a_T, but y_T is the position at the start of turn T.\n\nSo to have y_T=9, we must have reached before taking a_T.\n\nThe action a_T is taken at turn T, but it affects the next position.\n\nFor example, in the no obstacle case: to reach at turn 21, we take actions up to a_{20}, and at turn 21, we are at y=9 without taking action at turn 21.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from a_{17} to a_{20} for H=5, reach at turn 21.\n\nSimilarly, in our case, to reach at turn 25, we need actions from a_{17} to a_{24}, so that after a_{24} at turn 24, y_{25}=9.\n\nThen at turn 25, we are at (0,9).\n\nActions: a_{17} to a_{24}, 8 actions for H=9? H actions.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so for reach at turn 25, t1+H-1=25, 17+H-1=25, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions: a_{17} to a_{17+8} = a_{25}? a_{17} to a_{24} for t=0 to 7? Let's index.\n\nSet t starting from 0.\n\nFor t=0: a_{t1 +0} = a_{17}\n\nt=1: a_{18}\n\n...\n\nt=k: a_{17+k}\n\nUp to t=H-1: a_{17 + H-1}\n\nAnd we reach at turn t1 + H -1 = 17 + H -1.\n\nWith turn reach T=25, so 17+H-1=25, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nThen t from 0 to 8, actions a_{17+0} to a_{17+8} = a_{17} to a_{25}.\n\nBut a_{25} is action at turn 25.\n\nAt turn 25, we take a_{25}, but we need to be at y=9 at turn 25, so if we take action at turn 25, it means we are not at 9 yet, or we can choose S, but we should reach before.\n\nThe sequence should not include an action at the turn we reach.\n\nIn the no obstacle case, to reach at turn 21, actions a_{17} to a_{20}, so H=5, actions at turns 17,18,19,20, not at 21.\n\nSimilarly, here, to reach at turn 25, actions should be at turns 17 to 24, so 8 actions, H=9, t from 0 to 8, but a_{17+8}=a_{25}, which is turn 25, not correct.\n\nMistake.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, action at turn t1 + t.\n\nFor reach at turn T, T= t1 + H -1.\n\nThen the last action is at turn T, a_T.\n\nBut at turn T, we are at y_T, take a_T, then y_{T+1} is set.\n\nBut we need y_T=9.\n\nSo to have y_T=9, we must have that at the start of turn T, y_T=9, and we may take an action, but it doesn't change the fact that we are at 9 at turn T.\n\nThe action at turn T could be S, for example.\n\nIn the sequence, we can include a_T with S or something.\n\nBut in the output, it should be fine.\n\nFor example, in no obstacle, to reach at turn 21, we take a_{20}=U, and at turn 21, y=9.\n\nSimilarly, in our case, to reach at turn 25, we take a_{24}=U, and at turn 25, y=9.\n\nThen the action at turn 25 is not taken, so not in the sequence.\n\nThe sequence has actions up to a_{24} for turn 24.\n\nThen for H=9, t from 0 to 8, a_{17} to a_{25}, but a_{25} is not needed.\n\nI think there is confusion in the indexing.\n\nPerhaps H is the number of turns from start to end inclusive.\n\nBut the problem says \"number of turns H\" and \"sequence of actions for t=0 to H-1\"\n\nLet's look back.\n\n\" the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} \"\n\n\" to reach at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nSo for example, if H=1, sequence for t=0 to 0, one action at t1, reach at turn t1 +1 -1 = t1.\n\nBut at turn t1, before action, if we are not at 9, taking action may not reach at turn t1.\n\nUnless we are already at 9.\n\nBut here not.\n\nFor H=2, actions at t1 and t1+1, reach at turn t1 +2 -1 = t1+1.\n\nAfter taking a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1, we are at turn t1+1, but y_{t1+1} is before action or after?\n\nI think it's messy.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that the actions are taken at turns t1 to t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H-1, after taking the action, we have the position for that turn or next.\n\nI think for consistency, in the reach turn, it is after the actions.\n\nIn the no obstacle example: actions at 17,18,19,20 for H=4? But H=5 for turns.\n\nI think I should accept the sequence as per the output format.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t1}\" etc., up to the last action.\n\nFor reaching at turn 25, the last action is at turn 24.\n\nSo actions from turn 17 to turn 24.\n\nThat's 8 actions.\n\nThen H=9 for the number of turns.\n\nIn the sequence, we list actions for turn 17 to turn 24.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nFor the sequence, I can use the one with two S.\n\nBut to make it with less stay, or all U/D.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nNow, for the car state, I think I have all.\n\nBut in freeway 4, there are three cars, but only one blocks, as I had.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 17: D  (from y=5 to y=4 at turn 18)\n\nTurn 18: S  (stay at y=4 for turn 19)\n\nTurn 19: S  (stay at y=4 for turn 20)\n\nTurn 20: U  (to y=5 at turn 21)\n\nTurn 21: U  (to y=6 at turn 22)\n\nTurn 22: U  (to y=7 at turn 23)\n\nTurn 23: U  (to y=8 at turn 24)\n\nTurn 24: U  (to y=9 at turn 25)\n\nThen at turn 25, y=9.\n\nActions from turn 17 to 24.\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 17: D Turn 18: S Turn 19: S Turn 20: U Turn 21: U Turn 22: U Turn 23: U Turn 24: U }\n\nBut H=9, and reach at turn 25.\n\nTo save space, but I think this is minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can start going up immediately after the down.\n\nTurn 17: D, to y=4 turn 18\n\nTurn 18: U, to y=5 turn 19\n\nTurn 19: D, to y=4 turn 20  (to avoid)\n\nThen Turn 20: U, to y=5 turn 21\n\netc., but same number, and we have an extra down and up.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo the first sequence is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 17\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 9. This means the sequence of actions must ensure the player reaches (0, 9) at turn \\(25 = t_1 + H - 1 = 17 + 9 - 1\\).\n\nThe cars on the freeways block position \\(x = 0\\) at specific turns:\n- Freeways 1, 2, and 3 are blocked at turns 26, 27, 28, and 29.\n- Freeway 4 is blocked at turns 22, 23, and 24.\n- Freeways 5, 6, 7, and 8 are blocked only at turn 20.\n\nAt turn 20, freeways 5, 6, 7, and 8 are all blocked, so the player must not be on rows \\(y = 5, 6, 7,\\) or \\(8\\) at turn 20. The only safe rows at turn 20 are \\(y = 0, 1, 2, 3,\\) or \\(4\\). Starting from \\(y = 5\\) at turn 17, the player can move down to \\(y = 4\\) by turn 18 and remain there until turn 20 to avoid the blockage. After turn 20, the player can move directly up to \\(y = 9\\) without encountering any blockages on rows \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at the relevant turns.\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed as follows:\n- At turn 17, move down (D) to reach \\(y = 4\\) at turn 18. This avoids any immediate blockage and positions the player safely.\n- At turn 18, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 4\\) for turn 19, ensuring the player is safe and preparing for turn 20.\n- At turn 19, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 4\\) for turn 20, avoiding the blockage on rows 5-8 at turn 20.\n- At turn 20, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 5\\) at turn 21. Turn 20 is safe at \\(y = 4\\), and moving up then is efficient.\n- From turns 21 to 24, move up (U) each turn to reach \\(y = 6, 7, 8,\\) and finally \\(9\\) at turn 25. Rows \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are safe at these turns, as the blockages occur at different times.\n\nThis sequence uses 8 actions (from turn 17 to turn 24) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 25, with \\(H = 9\\) turns total (turns 17 to 25 inclusive).\n\nThe actions are:\n- Turn 17: D (move down to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 18)\n- Turn 18: S (stay at \\(y = 4\\) for turn 19)\n- Turn 19: S (stay at \\(y = 4\\) for turn 20)\n- Turn 20: U (move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 21)\n- Turn 21: U (move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 22)\n- Turn 22: U (move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 23)\n- Turn 23: U (move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 24)\n- Turn 24: U (move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 25)\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 17:\\, D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18:\\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19:\\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20:\\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21:\\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22:\\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23:\\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24:\\, U }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn 20 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, so I have to consider where they are at each turn.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movement. For each car, at turn t1=20, we have the head and tail positions. Since the direction is given, and for right-moving cars, head is greater than tail, I think. Let me check the notation.\n\nFor a right-moving car: Span(t1) = [τ, h], with τ < h, I assume, since it's from tail to head. In the update, for right-moving, it becomes [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, left-moving would have head less than tail, but in this case, all cars are right-moving, I think. Looking at the table:\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3) — head -48, tail -59? That seems odd because -48 > -59, so if it's right-moving, head should be greater, but here head is -48, tail is -59, and -48 > -59, so head is at -48, tail at -59, which means the car is from -59 to -48, so as it moves right, positions increase.\n\nBut in the span, it says [τ, h] for right-moving, with τ = tail, h = head.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: τ = -59, h = -48, so span at t1=20 is [-59, -48].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y at that turn, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn T, if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I only care about the freeway I'm on at each turn.\n\nStart at turn 20, position y=0. I need to get to y=9.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, I think; freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0 and y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nBut I start at (0,0), which might be the bottom, and need to reach (0,9), top.\n\ny=0 to y=9, with freeways in between.\n\nAt each turn, I can move up, down, or stay, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must be between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nNow, I need the minimal number of turns H, meaning from turn 20 to turn 20+H-1, so after H actions, I reach y=9 at turn 20+H-1.\n\nLet t be the turn number starting from t1=20.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t determines Δy for y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\ny_{t+1} is set at turn t+1.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nI choose action a_t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T if when I am at y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the car span at turn T.\n\nIf I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose to go to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I am only on y_T, so I check cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, when I arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, I check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe note says: if I decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so even if cars on y_{T+1} have 0 in span at T, but not at T+1, it's ok.\n\nBut since I'm not on it at T, I don't care about y_{T+1} at T.\n\nOnly care about the current row at current turn.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9, so I have to cross y=1 to y=8.\n\nEach freeway has cars moving.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway at t=20.\n\nFreeway k=1: one car: τ = -59, h = -48, d=right, s=3. So span at t=20: [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway k=2: same as k=1: [-59, -48], right, s=3\n\nFreeway k=3: same: [-59, -48], right, s=3\n\nFreeway k=4: three cars:\n\nFirst: (-48, -59, right, 4) — τ=-59, h=-48? But it says head h, tail τ, and direction.\n\nIn the table: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor k=4: (-48, -59, right, 4) so h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=4\n\nSimilarly, (-12, -23, right, 4) h=-12, τ=-23\n\nAnd (24, 13, right, 4) h=24, τ=13? τ=13, h=24, so since right, span [13,24]\n\nBut τ and h, with τ < h for right, I assume.\n\nIn (24,13), it says head 24, tail 13, so if right-moving, head is at 24, tail at 13, so the car is from 13 to 24, so span [13,24].\n\nSimilarly, for (-48,-59), head -48, tail -59, so span [-59,-48].\n\nNow for k=4: cars:\n\nCar1: h=-48, τ=-59, so span [-59,-48], s=4, right\n\nCar2: h=-12, τ=-23, span [-23,-12]? τ=-23, h=-12, so -23 to -12, span [-23,-12]\n\nCar3: h=24, τ=13, span [13,24], s=4, right\n\nτ=13, h=24, so min to max is 13 to 24.\n\nSimilarly, freeway k=5: two cars\n\nFirst: (-48, -59, right, 12) so h=-48, τ=-59, span [-59,-48], s=12\n\nSecond: (0, -11, right, 12) h=0, τ=-11, span [-11,0], s=12\n\nτ=-11, h=0, so span [-11,0]\n\nSimilarly, k=6: same as k=5: car1: [-59,-48], s=12; car2: [-11,0], s=12\n\nk=7: same: car1: [-59,-48], s=12; car2: [-11,0], s=12\n\nk=8: same: car1: [-59,-48], s=12; car2: [-11,0], s=12\n\nk=1,2,3 have only one car each: [-59,-48], s=3\n\nk=4 has three cars.\n\nI need to find when 0 is in the span for each freeway at each turn.\n\nSince the cars are moving, the span changes with time.\n\nLet t be the time since t1=20, so at time T = t1 + δt = 20 + δt, the span for a car is shifted by s * δt for right-moving.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, at turn T, span is [τ + s*(T - 20), h + s*(T - 20)] for right-moving, since it moves right.\n\nSince T - 20 is the time elapsed, let δt = T - 20, so at turn 20 + δt.\n\nSpan: for right-moving car, [τ + s δt, h + s δt]\n\nCollision if player is on freeway k at turn 20 + δt and 0 is in [τ + s δt, h + s δt] for some car on that freeway.\n\nSince multiple cars, for each freeway, I need to know if there is any car covering 0 at that turn.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I can find the times when 0 is covered.\n\nFirst, freeway k=1: only one car, τ=-59, h=-48, s=3\n\nSpan at δt: [-59 + 3 δt, -48 + 3 δt]\n\n0 in this interval when:\n\n-59 + 3 δt <= 0 <= -48 + 3 δt\n\nSo -59 + 3 δt <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 3 δt\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 3 δt <= 0 => 3 δt <= 59 => δt <= 59/3 = 19.666, so δt <= 19 since turns integer? δt is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nT is integer, so δt integer.\n\nSo -59 + 3 δt <= 0 => 3 δt <= 59 => δt <= 19 since 3*19=57<59, 3*20=60>59? Let's calculate.\n\n3 δt <= 59, δt <= floor(59/3) = 19.666, so δt <= 19? 3*19=57, -59+57=-2 <=0 true.\n\n3*20=60, -59+60=1 >0, so first inequality: -59 +3δt <=0 when 3δt <=59, δt <=19 since 3*19=57, -59+57=-2<=0, 3*20=60, -59+60=1>0, so for δt <=19, -59+3δt <=0? Let's solve properly.\n\n-59 +3δt <=0 => 3δt <=59 => δt <= 59/3 = 19 + 2/3, so since δt integer, δt <=19\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -48 +3δt => 48 <= 3δt => δt >= 16\n\nBecause 3δt >=48, δt >=16\n\nSo 0 in span when δt >=16 and δt <=19\n\nSimilarly for k=2 and k=3, same cars, so same: unsafe for δt from 16 to 19 inclusive.\n\nδt=16,17,18,19\n\nNow freeway k=4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: τ=-59, h=-48, s=4\n\nSpan: [-59 +4δt, -48 +4δt]\n\n0 in this when -59+4δt <=0 <= -48+4δt\n\n-59+4δt <=0 => 4δt <=59 => δt <=14.75, so δt <=14\n\n0 <= -48+4δt => 48 <=4δt => δt >=12\n\nSo for first car, unsafe when δt=12,13,14\n\nSecond car: τ=-23, h=-12, s=4\n\nSpan: [-23 +4δt, -12 +4δt]\n\n0 in this: -23+4δt <=0 <= -12+4δt\n\n-23+4δt <=0 => 4δt <=23 => δt <=5.75, δt <=5\n\n0 <= -12+4δt => 12 <=4δt => δt >=3\n\nSo unsafe for δt=3,4,5\n\nThird car: τ=13, h=24, s=4\n\nSpan: [13+4δt, 24+4δt]\n\n0 in this: 13+4δt <=0 <=24+4δt? But 13+4δt >=13>0 for δt>=0, so 0 <= 13+4δt always true since min 13>0, but 13+4δt <=0? 13+4δt >=13>0, so 13+4δt <=0 is impossible. Thus, 0 never in span for this car.\n\nSo for k=4, unsafe if 0 in any car: first car δt=12,13,14; second car δt=3,4,5; third car never. So overall unsafe for δt=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nNow freeway k=5: two cars\n\nFirst car: τ=-59, h=-48, s=12\n\nSpan: [-59+12δt, -48+12δt]\n\n0 in this: -59+12δt <=0 <= -48+12δt\n\n-59+12δt <=0 => 12δt <=59 => δt <=59/12≈4.916, so δt <=4\n\n0 <= -48+12δt => 48 <=12δt => δt >=4\n\nSo for δt=4: -59+48=-11 <=0, -48+48=0 <=0? 0 <=0 true, and -11<=0 true.\n\nAt δt=4, span: -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, so [ -11, 0 ], so 0 is included, since tail or head? Span [τ + sδt, h + sδt], and for collision, if 0 in the span, including endpoints I assume.\n\nSo at δt=4, span [-11,0], 0 is the upper end, so yes, 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly, δt=4: -59+48=-11, -48+48=0, [ -11, 0]\n\nFor δt=5: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nδt=3: -59+36=-23, -48+36=-12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only δt=4 unsafe for first car.\n\nSecond car: τ=-11, h=0, s=12\n\nSpan: [-11+12δt, 0+12δt] = [-11+12δt, 12δt]\n\n0 in this: -11+12δt <=0 <= 12δt\n\nLeft: -11+12δt <=0 => 12δt <=11 => δt <=11/12<1, so δt <=0\n\nBut δt >=0, at δt=0: span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nFor δt=1: [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at δt=0, which is turn 20, but turn 20, we are at y=0, not on freeway, so for freeway, we start from when we are on it.\n\nAt δt=0, turn 20, we are at y=0, not on freeway 5, so we don't consider collision at that point for freeway.\n\nFor the car, at δt=0, span is [-11,0], but since we are not on freeway 5 at turn 20, no collision.\n\nFor δt>=1, span: for example δt=1, [1,12], no 0.\n\nSo for second car, never unsafe except possibly at δt=0, but not relevant.\n\nThus for k=5, only unsafe when first car covers 0, which is at δt=4.\n\nSimilarly for k=6,7,8 same as k=5.\n\nk=6: cars same as k=5: first car [-59,-48] s=12, unsafe at δt=4; second car [-11,0] s=12, unsafe only at δt=0, not relevant.\n\nSo for k=6, unsafe only at δt=4.\n\nSimilarly k=7 and k=8.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, the unsafe times (δt from 0, but δt=0 is turn 20)\n\nSince we start at y=0 at turn 20, we need to enter freeways later.\n\nUnsafe δt for each freeway:\n\nk=1: unsafe δt=16,17,18,19\n\nk=2: same, 16-19\n\nk=3: same, 16-19\n\nk=4: unsafe δt=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nk=5: unsafe δt=4\n\nk=6: unsafe δt=4\n\nk=7: unsafe δt=4\n\nk=8: unsafe δt=4\n\nk=5 to 8 all unsafe only at δt=4?

So H=9 turns, from turn 20 to 28? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 20, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{20}, at turn 21, y_{21} = y_20 + Δy_20.\n\nSet t=20.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 20+H, y_{20+H} = 9.\n\nAnd we have actions from a_{20} to a_{20+H-1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions defines the path.\n\ny_{20} = 0\n\ny_{21} = y_{20} + Δy_{20}\n\n...\n\ny_{20+H} = y_{20+H-1} + Δy_{20+H-1} = 9\n\nSince y increases by at most 1 each step, to go from 0 to 9, minimum H=9, with all U actions.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions when on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nIn the direct path, we would be on each freeway at some turn.\n\nFor example, with all U:\n\nAt turn 20: y=0, safe\n\na_{20} = U, so y_{21} = 1\n\nAt turn 21, y=1, on freeway 1. Now, at δt=1 (since turn 21 = 20 +1, δt=1)\n\nFor k=1, unsafe at δt=16-19, so at δt=1, is it safe? δt=1 not in 16-19, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 22, y=2, δt=2, freeway 2, unsafe only 16-19, δt=2 safe.\n\nTurn 23, y=3, δt=3, freeway 3, unsafe 16-19, δt=3 safe.\n\nBut freeway 3 is k=3, same as k=1,2.\n\nNow turn 24, y=4, δt=4, freeway k=4.\n\nk=4 unsafe at δt=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nδt=4 is unsafe! So at turn 24, on k=4, δt=4, which is unsafe.\n\nCannot be there.\n\nAlso, for y=5 to 8, at δt=5 to 8.\n\nk=5 unsafe at δt=4, which is past.\n\nAt turn 25, y=5, δt=5, freeway 5.\n\nk=5 unsafe only at δt=4, δt=5 safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 26, y=6, δt=6, k=6 unsafe only δt=4, safe.\n\nTurn 27, y=7, δt=7, k=7 safe.\n\nTurn 28, y=8, δt=8, k=8 safe.\n\nThen turn 29, y=9, safe.\n\nBut at turn 24, y=4, δt=4, k=4 unsafe, so collision.\n\nSo direct path not possible at that time.\n\nI need to avoid being on k=4 at δt=4.\n\nδt=4 is turn 24.\n\nI could delay or advance the time I am on each freeway.\n\nSince I can move down or stay, I can take more turns to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nBut I want minimal H, so probably not too many extra turns.\n\nFirst, let's list the unsafe times for each freeway.\n\nFreeway | unsafe δt\n\nk=1: 16-19\n\nk=2: 16-19\n\nk=3: 16-19\n\nk=4: 3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nk=5: 4\n\nk=6: 4\n\nk=7: 4\n\nk=8: 4\n\nk=5 to 8 only unsafe at δt=4, which is turn 24.\n\nk=4 unsafe at multiple times: 3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nThe critical part is around δt=4.\n\nI need to be on y=1 at some turn, but avoid unsafe times for k=1, which are late, 16-19, so for early turns, k=1 is safe except late.\n\nSimilarly for k=2,3.\n\nk=4 has early and mid unsafe times.\n\nI could go up slowly or fast.\n\nSince k=5 to 8 are only unsafe at δt=4, I should avoid being on y=5,6,7,8 at turn 24 (δt=4).\n\nSimilarly, for k=4, avoid at δt=4, but also other times.\n\nBut δt=4 is common.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to be on each y from 1 to 8 at some turn.\n\nLet t_y be the turn when I am on y, for y=1 to 8.\n\nThen at turn t_y, I must be safe for freeway y at that turn.\n\nt_y = 20 + δt_y for some δt_y.\n\nThen for each y, at δt_y, it must not be unsafe for k=y.\n\nAlso, since I move step by step, the turns t_y are consecutive or with possible stays, but since I can stay, t_y might not be consecutive, but y changes by at most 1 per turn, so the sequence of y positions has to be non-decreasing or with down, but to minimize time, probably mostly up, with possible down or stay to avoid.\n\nBut down might not help, since I have to go up eventually.\n\nStaying might be useful to wait.\n\nNow, the unsafe times:\n\nFor k=1,2,3: unsafe only at δt=16,17,18,19, so for early δt, safe. Since δt starts from 1 probably, for t_y >=21, δt_y >=1.\n\nSimilarly, for k=4, unsafe at δt=3,4,5,12,13,14. So avoid these.\n\nFor k=5,6,7,8: unsafe only at δt=4, so must avoid t_y = 20 +4 = 24 for y=5,6,7,8.\n\nThat is, I cannot be on y=5,6,7, or 8 at turn 24.\n\nNow, since I need to go through all, I need to schedule the times.\n\nNow, let me assume I go up as fast as possible, but avoid the bad times.\n\nStart at t=20, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSuppose I want to be on y=4 at a safe time.\n\nk=4 unsafe at δt=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nSo safe times for k=4: δt <=2 or 6<=δt<=11 or δt>=15.\n\nδt=0: turn 20, but at turn 20, y=0, not on k=4, so not considered.\n\nδt=1,2: safe for k=4\n\nδt=6 to 11: safe\n\nδt=15 and above, but k=4 unsafe up to 14, so δt>=15 safe.\n\nSimilarly, for k=5 to 8, safe except δt=4.\n\nNow, I also need to be on y=1,2,3 at times not 16-19 for k=1,2,3.\n\nBut since 16-19 are late, if I go early, I can avoid.\n\nNow, the problem is y=5 to 8 at turn 24.\n\nI cannot be on any of them at turn 24.\n\nSo, I need to be on y=5 either before or after turn 24.\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\nSince I have to go through them, I need to cross them at different times.\n\nFor example, I could be on y=5 at turn 23 or 25, etc.\n\nBut let's think about the sequence.\n\nI need to minimize the number of turns, so I should go up when possible.\n\nStart from y=0.\n\nI can go to y=1 at turn 21.\n\nAt turn 21, y=1, δt=1, k=1 safe (since unsafe 16-19)\n\nThen from y=1, I can go to y=2 at turn 22.\n\nTurn 22, y=2, δt=2, k=2 safe.\n\nThen to y=3 at turn 23.\n\nTurn 23, y=3, δt=3, k=3 safe (δt=3 not 16-19)\n\nNow at turn 23, y=3.\n\nNext, I need to go to y=4.\n\nBut at turn 24, if I go to y=4, δt=4, which is unsafe for k=4.\n\nI could stay at y=3 for one turn.\n\nAt turn 24, I stay at y=3, so y=3 at turn 24, δt=4.\n\nk=3 unsafe at δt=16-19, δt=4 not in, so safe.\n\nThen at turn 25, I go to y=4, δt=5.\n\nδt=5, turn 25, y=4, k=4.\n\nNow k=4 unsafe at δt=5? δt=5 is in unsafe 3,4,5,12,13,14, yes δt=5 unsafe.\n\nOh, problem.\n\nδt=5 is unsafe for k=4.\n\nIf I go to y=4 at turn 25, δt=5, unsafe.\n\nIf I go at turn 24, δt=4, unsafe.\n\nWhat about earlier?\n\nCan I go to y=4 earlier?\n\nFor example, from turn 21, y=1, I could have gone directly, but I have to go through y=2 and y=3.\n\nAt turn 22, y=2, I could stay or go down, but down not helpful.\n\nAt turn 22, y=2, I can stay at y=2 for multiple turns.\n\nBut let's see possible times for y=4.\n\nSafe δt for k=4: δt <=2 or 6<=δt<=11 or δt>=15.\n\nδt<=2: turn 22 or earlier? Turn at δt=1: turn 21, but at turn 21, if y=4, but I start at y=0, I need to reach y=4.\n\nEarliest to be on y=4: if I go up every turn from t=20.\n\nt=20: y=0\n\nt=21: y=1\n\nt=22: y=2\n\nt=23: y=3\n\nt=24: y=4\n\nSo earliest t=24 for y=4, δt=4.\n\nBut δt=4 unsafe.\n\nIf I delay, t=25 y=4, δt=5 unsafe.\n\nt=26 y=4, δt=6, which is safe, since 6 in 6-11.\n\nSimilarly, t=22 y=4? But to be at y=4 at t=22, I need to have moved faster, but I can only change by 1 per turn, so impossible to be at y=4 before t=24.\n\ny=4 at turn t, requires at least 4 steps from start.\n\nAt t=20, y=0\n\nAfter 0 actions, y=0\n\nAfter 1 action, t=21, y<=1\n\nAfter 2 actions, t=22, y<=2\n\nAfter 3 actions, t=23, y<=3\n\nAfter 4 actions, t=24, y<=4\n\nSo earliest to be at y=4 is t=24.\n\nSimilarly, latest, but we want minimal time, so not late.\n\nAt t=24, y=4, δt=4, unsafe.\n\nNext possible safe time for y=4 is t=26, δt=6, since δt=6 safe.\n\nt=25, δt=5, unsafe.\n\nt=26, δt=6 safe.\n\nt=27, δt=7 safe, etc.\n\nBut t=26 is later.\n\nNow, for y=5 to 8, I need to avoid turn 24.\n\nTurn 24 is δt=4.\n\nI cannot be on y=5,6,7,8 at turn 24.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nFirst, I can go up to y=3 quickly.\n\nt=20: y=0\n\na20: U, t=21: y=1, safe\n\na21: U, t=22: y=2, safe\n\na22: U, t=23: y=3, safe\n\nNow at t=23, y=3.\n\nI need to go to y=4, but if I go U at t=23, to y=4 at t=24, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, S at t=23, then at t=24, y=3, δt=4, k=3 safe (since unsafe only 16-19)\n\nThen at t=24, I am at y=3.\n\nI can go to y=4 at t=25, but t=25, y=4, δt=5, unsafe for k=4.\n\nNot good.\n\nI could go to y=4 later.\n\nBut how? I have to be at y=3, I can stay multiple turns.\n\nAt t=24, y=3, I can stay again, S at t=24, so at t=25, y=3, δt=5.\n\nk=3 unsafe only 16-19, δt=5 safe.\n\nThen at t=25, I can go to y=4, but t=25, y=4, δt=5, unsafe for k=4.\n\nStill problem.\n\nI need to reach y=4 at δt=6 or later.\n\nδt=6 is t=26.\n\nSo, I need to be at y=4 at t=26 or later.\n\nSimilarly, I can be at y=3 for some turns.\n\nSet that at turn t, I am at y=3.\n\nThen to go to y=4 at safe time, e.g. t=26.\n\nSo from t=23 to t=26, I can stay at y=3.\n\nt=23: y=3\n\na23: S, t=24: y=3\n\na24: S, t=25: y=3\n\na25: U, t=26: y=4\n\nAt t=26, y=4, δt=6, which is safe for k=4 (δt=6 in 6-11)\n\nThen at t=26, y=4.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=5.\n\nBut I also have to avoid being on y=5,6,7,8 at turn 24, but turn 24 is past, t=26 now.\n\nNow, y=5 to 8, I need to be careful only for their unsafe times, but k=5 to 8 only unsafe at δt=4, which is past, so for later times, all safe for k=5 to 8.\n\nk=5 to 8 unsafe only at δt=4, so for δt>4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, for k=4, at δt=6, safe, and going forward.\n\nNow, from t=26, y=4, I can go up to y=5 at t=27.\n\nt=27, y=5, δt=7\n\nk=5 safe, since δt=7 ≠4\n\nSimilarly, t=28, y=6, δt=8, k=6 safe\n\nt=29, y=7, δt=9, k=7 safe\n\nt=30, y=8, δt=10, k=8 safe\n\nThen t=31, y=9, done.\n\nBut I reached y=9 at t=31, which is turn 31.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=20 to t=30 actions, a20 to a30, 11 actions? Let's count.\n\nt=20: start y=0\n\nAfter a20: U, t=21 y=1\n\na21: U, t=22 y=2\n\na22: U, t=23 y=3\n\na23: S, t=24 y=3\n\na24: S, t=25 y=3\n\na25: U, t=26 y=4\n\na26: U, t=27 y=5\n\na27: U, t=28 y=6\n\na28: U, t=29 y=7\n\na29: U, t=30 y=8\n\na30: U, t=31 y=9\n\nActions from a20 to a30, that's 11 actions.\n\nH=11, reached at turn 31.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nI wasted two turns staying at y=3.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster by not staying or going down.\n\nAnother idea: since k=4 is safe at δt=1 or 2, but I cannot reach y=4 at t=21 or 22, because minimum t=24.\n\nt=21 y=1, t=22 y=2, t=23 y=3, t=24 y=4 earliest.\n\nδt=1 is t=21, but y=1 not y=4.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=4 at δt<=2.\n\nSimilarly, δt=6 to 11 or >=15.\n\nδt=6 is t=26, as above.\n\nBut I could reach y=4 earlier if I could, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps I can go to higher y and come back, but that might take more time.\n\nFor example, go to y=4 at safe time later, but same as above.\n\nBut let's see if I can avoid the y=5-8 at turn 24 issue, but in this case I did.\n\nBut H=11, while minimum is 9, so 2 extra turns.\n\nCan I save time?\n\nAnother thought: for k=4, it is safe at δt=1 and 2, but I can't be there.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=4 at δt=6, but with fewer stays.\n\nBut I have to wait until t=26 to be on y=4.\n\nFrom y=3, I can go down to y=2 or something, but that might not help.\n\nLet's list all safe times for each freeway.\n\nFor k=1: safe δt except 16-19, so for early, δt=1 to 15 safe, δt=20+ safe but we don't care.\n\nSimilarly k=2 and k=3 same.\n\nk=4: safe δt: 1,2,6,7,8,9,10,11,15,... etc.\n\nk=5: safe all δt except 4\n\nSimilarly k=6,7,8 same.\n\nNow, I need to assign t_y for y=1 to 8.\n\nWith t_y = 20 + δt_y\n\nAnd |t_{y+1} - t_y| <=1, since move to adjacent or stay.\n\nActually, since y changes by at most 1, the turn when I first reach y or last, but for the time I am on y, it could be multiple turns if I stay.\n\nTo minimize time, I should not stay unless necessary, so I can assume I move up each time except when I need to wait.\n\nThe sequence of y from 0 to 9, with actions.\n\nDefine the turn when I leave y=0 and arrive at y=9.\n\nSet t_start = 20\n\ny=0 at t=20\n\nThen I move to y=1 at some t1, etc.\n\nBut I am on each y at specific turn.\n\nLet me define the arrival turn at each y.\n\nLet t_arrive(y) be the turn when I first reach y.\n\nThen for y=1, t_arrive(1) >=21\n\nSimilarly, t_arrive(9) = 20 + H\n\nAnd t_arrive(y+1) = t_arrive(y) or t_arrive(y) +1 or more, if I stay or go down, but to min time, t_arrive(y+1) = t_arrive(y) +1 if I move up directly.\n\nBut I might stay or go down.\n\nIn general, t_arrive(y+1) >= t_arrive(y) +1\n\nAnd for safety, at turn t_arrive(y), I must be safe for k=y, since that's when I first on it, but if I stay multiple turns, I need all to be safe, but if I move up quickly, I am on each y only one turn.\n\nIn the minimal path, I might not stay, so assume I am on each y exactly one turn, except possible at start or end.\n\nBut at y=0 and y=9, no issue.\n\nSo assume that I visit each y from 1 to 8 exactly once, at some turn t_y.\n\nThen t_y for y=1 to 8, with t_{y+1} = t_y +1 for y=1 to7, if I move up directly.\n\nt_y and t_{y+1} differ by at least 1, but since I move to adjacent, if I go directly, t_{y+1} = t_y +1.\n\nIf I stay, t_{y+1} > t_y +1.\n\nBut to min time, we want t_{y+1} = t_y +1 when possible.\n\nNow, t_y = 20 + δt_y\n\nThen for each y, at δt_y, must be safe for k=y.\n\nAlso, t_1 = 21 or later, t_8 = ? and t_9 = t_8 +1 or later.\n\nt_arrive(9) = t_8 +1 if go up from 8.\n\nNow, the constraints:\n\nFor k=1: δt_1 not in {16,17,18,19}\n\nSimilarly for k=2,3.\n\nFor k=4: δt_4 not in {3,4,5,12,13,14}\n\nFor k=5: δt_5 not 4\n\nSimilarly k=6,7,8: δt not 4\n\nSince t_{y+1} = t_y +1 for direct move, then δt_{y+1} = δt_y +1\n\nBecause t_{y+1} = t_y +1, so if t_y = 20 + δt_y, t_{y+1} = 20 + δt_y +1 = 20 + (δt_y +1)\n\nSo δt_{y+1} = δt_y +1\n\nThus the δt sequence increases by 1 for each y.\n\nSo δt_y = δt_1 + (y-1)\n\nFor example, δt_1 for y=1, δt_2 = δt_1 +1 for y=2, δt_3 = δt_1 +2, ..., δt_8 = δt_1 +7\n\nThen for each, the safety:\n\nFor y=1, k=1: δt_1 not in {16,17,18,19}\n\ny=2, k=2: δt_2 = δt_1 +1 not in {16,17,18,19}\n\ny=3, k=3: δt_3 = δt_1 +2 not in {16,17,18,19}\n\ny=4, k=4: δt_4 = δt_1 +3 not in {3,4,5,12,13,14}\n\ny=5, k=5: δt_5 = δt_1 +4 not 4\n\ny=6, k=6: δt_6 = δt_1 +5 not 4\n\ny=7, k=7: δt_7 = δt_1 +6 not 4\n\ny=8, k=8: δt_8 = δt_1 +7 not 4\n\nδt_5 = δt_1 +4 not 4, so δt_1 +4 ≠ 4, so δt_1 ≠ 0\n\nBut δt_1 is for y=1, at least 1, so δt_1 >=1, so δt_1 +4 >=5 >4, so δt_1 +4 ≠4 always true. Similarly for others, not 4 is easy since δt_1 >=1, δt_5 = δt_1 +4 >=5 >4, so never 4, similarly δt_6 >=6, etc., all greater than 4, so for y=5 to 8, the not 4 condition is always true for δt_1 >=1.\n\nδt_5 = δt_1 +4, and δt_1 >=1, so δt_5 >=5, which is not 4, so always safe for k=5 to 8, as long as we are not at turn 24, which is δt=4, but since δt_y for y>=5 is at least δt_1 +4 >=5, so turn at least 25, not 24.\n\nSimilarly, for y=4, δt_4 = δt_1 +3\n\nMust not be in {3,4,5,12,13,14}\n\nFor y=1,2,3: δt_1 not in {16,17,18,19}, δt_2 = δt_1 +1 not in, δt_3 = δt_1 +2 not in.\n\nSince the set is contiguous, it might constrain δt_1.\n\nFirst, for y=1: δt_1 not 16-19\n\ny=2: δt_2 = δt_1 +1 not 16-19, so δt_1 not 15-18\n\ny=3: δt_3 = δt_1 +2 not 16-19, so δt_1 not 14-17\n\nThe forbidden for δt_1 from these:\n\nFrom y=1: not 16,17,18,19\n\ny=2: not 15,16,17,18\n\ny=3: not 14,15,16,17\n\nSo overall, δt_1 cannot be 14,15,16,17,18,19\n\nFrom y=1: cannot 16-19\n\ny=2: cannot 15-18\n\ny=3: cannot 14-17\n\nSo union: cannot 14 to 19 inclusive.\n\nThus δt_1 <=13 or δt_1 >=20\n\nBut δt_1 >=1, and for early, possible.\n\nNow for y=4: δt_4 = δt_1 +3 not in {3,4,5,12,13,14}\n\nSo δt_1 +3 not 3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nThus δt_1 not 0,1,2,9,10,11\n\nBut δt_1 >=1, so not 1,2,9,10,11\n\nδt_1 not 0, but δt_1 >=1, so impossible to be 0, so not 1,2,9,10,11\n\nδt_1 +3 not 3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nSo δt_1 not (3-3=0), (4-3=1), (5-3=2), (12-3=9), (13-3=10), (14-3=11)\n\nSo δt_1 not in {0,1,2,9,10,11}\n\nSince δt_1 >=1, not 0, so δt_1 cannot be 1,2,9,10,11\n\nFrom above, for y=1,2,3, δt_1 cannot be 14-19.\n\nFor y=4, δt_1 cannot be 1,2,9,10,11.\n\nSo possible δt_1: 3,4,5,6,7,8,12,13,20,...\n\nBut from y=1,2,3, δt_1 <=13 or >=20, so 12,13 possible, or 20+.\n\nNow for y=4, cannot 9,10,11, so δt_1 cannot be 9,10,11.\n\nSo possible δt_1: 3,4,5,6,7,8,12,13\n\nNow, for each, we can compute.\n\nAlso, for y=5 to 8, no issue as before.\n\nNow, t_arrive(1) = 20 + δt_1\n\nThen t_arrive(9) = t_arrive(1) + 8, since from y=1 to y=9, 8 steps.\n\nt_arrive(1) at turn T, then t_arrive(2) = T+1, ..., t_arrive(9) = T+8\n\nSo to min H, min t_arrive(9), which is min T+8, so min T, t_arrive(1).\n\nSince H = t_arrive(9) - 20, and t_arrive(9) = t_arrive(1) + 8, so H = (t_arrive(1) + 8) - 20 = t_arrive(1) - 12\n\nt_arrive(1) = 20 + δt_1, so H = (20 + δt_1) - 12 + ?

Turns: t=20 start, after H actions, at turn 20+H.\n\nt_arrive(9)=32, so 20 + H = 32, H=12.\n\nWorse than before.\n\nSimilarly, δt_1=5: t_arrive(1)=25, H=5+8=13, worse.\n\nSo min δt_1=3, H=11.\n\nBut earlier with direct but waiting, also H=11.\n\nCan I get H<11?\n\nδt_1 min 3, H=11.\n\nBut perhaps I can have stays at some points to reduce the arrival time at later y, but since I need to go through all, it might not help.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps for y=4, I can be there at safe time with smaller δt, but I can't reach early.\n\nPerhaps I can go down from higher y to avoid, but that might take more time.\n\nFor example, go to y=4 at δt=1 or 2, but impossible.\n\nδt=1 or 2 for k=4 safe, but I can't be on y=4 at t=21 or 22.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps for the unsafe y=5-8 at turn 24, but since I can be on them later, it's fine.\n\nBut in the sequence with δt_1=3, I have to stay at y=0 for two turns.\n\nBut that seems necessary.\n\nPerhaps I can start moving up but stop at some point.\n\nFor example, go to y=1 at t=21, δt=1, safe.\n\nThen instead of going up, stay at y=1 for some time, but that might delay more.\n\nFor instance, at t=21, y=1, I can stay.\n\nThen go to y=2 later.\n\nBut to reach y=4 at safe time, say t=26.\n\nIf I go to y=1 at t=21, then I need to be at y=4 at t=26.\n\nFrom y=1 to y=4, need 3 steps, so at least 3 turns.\n\nSo from t=21, I can go up at t=22 to y=2, t=23 to y=3, t=24 to y=4, but t=24 y=4 δt=4 unsafe.\n\nOr stay at y=1 until t=23, then go to y=2 at t=24, etc., but later.\n\nt=21: y=1\n\na21: S, t=22: y=1\n\na22: S, t=23: y=1\n\na23: U, t=24: y=2\n\nThen at t=24, y=2, δt=4, k=2 safe (not 16-19)\n\nThen a24: U, t=25: y=3, δt=5, k=3 safe\n\na25: U, t=26: y=4, δt=6, safe for k=4\n\nThen same as before, y=5 at t=27, etc., to y=9 at t=31, same H=11.\n\nNo gain.\n\nGo to y=1 earlier, but I started at t=20 y=0, earliest t=21 y=1.\n\nSo seems H=11 is best.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a way with H=10.\n\nH=10, then t_arrive(9)=30.\n\nt_arrive(9) = t_arrive(1) +8 =30\n\nSo t_arrive(1) =22\n\nThus δt_1=2\n\nNow, is δt_1=2 possible?\n\nFrom above, possible δt_1: 3,4,5,6,7,8,12,13 — 2 not in, because for y=4, δt_1 cannot be 2.\n\nδt_1=2, then for y=4, δt_4 = δt_1 +3 =5\n\nδt_4=5, which is unsafe for k=4, since in {3,4,5}\n\nSo cannot.\n\nSimilarly, δt_1=1, not possible.\n\nδt_1=0, impossible.\n\nSo min δt_1=3, H=11.\n\nThus minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to specify actions.\n\nFrom above, one way:\n\nt=20: y=0, action S or? We need to be at y=0 until we move.\n\nTo have t_arrive(1)=23.\n\nSo at t=20: y=0, we can choose a20: S, so t=21: y=0\n\na21: S, t=22: y=0\n\na22: U, t=23: y=1\n\nThen a23: U, t=24: y=2\n\na24: U, t=25: y=3\n\na25: U, t=26: y=4\n\na26: U, t=27: y=5\n\na27: U, t=28: y=6\n\na28: U, t=29: y=7\n\na29: U, t=30: y=8\n\na30: U, t=31: y=9\n\nIn this, at t=24, y=2, which is freeway 2, δt=4, safe.\n\nt=25, y=3, δt=5, freeway 3, safe.\n\nt=26, y=4, δt=6, freeway 4, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nWe could have stayed less, but with δt_1=3, we must start moving up at t=22.\n\nAnother sequence: go to y=1 earlier and stay.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=20: a20: U, t=21: y=1\n\nThen stay: a21: S, t=22: y=1\n\na22: S, t=23: y=1\n\na23: U, t=24: y=2\n\na24: U, t=25: y=3\n\na25: U, t=26: y=4\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut in this case, at t=21, y=1, δt=1, safe, but we stayed extra at y=1, and reached y=9 at same t=31.\n\nNo better.\n\nSince k=4 is safe at δt=1 and 2, but I can't be there, or at δt=15+, but late.\n\nBut not better.\n\nSo H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need the sequence of actions from turn 20.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nTurn 20: S (to stay at y=0)\n\nTurn 21: S (stay at y=0)\n\nTurn 22: U (to y=1)\n\nTurn 23: U (to y=2)\n\nTurn 24: U (to y=3)\n\nTurn 25: U (to y=4) — at t=25, y=3?

The unsafe times for each freeway, relative to \\(\\delta t = T - 20\\) (where \\(T\\) is the turn number), are:\n\n- Freeway 1: unsafe at \\(\\delta t = 16, 17, 18, 19\\)\n- Freeway 2: unsafe at \\(\\delta t = 16, 17, 18, 19\\)\n- Freeway 3: unsafe at \\(\\delta t = 16, 17, 18, 19\\)\n- Freeway 4: unsafe at \\(\\delta t = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\\)\n- Freeway 5: unsafe at \\(\\delta t = 4\\)\n- Freeway 6: unsafe at \\(\\delta t = 4\\)\n- Freeway 7: unsafe at \\(\\delta t = 4\\)\n- Freeway 8: unsafe at \\(\\delta t = 4\\)\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\(y = 9\\) is 11, achieved by staying at \\(y = 0\\) for the first two turns (turns 20 and 21) to delay the ascent, then moving up consistently from turn 22 onward. This sequence ensures that the player is not on any freeway during its unsafe times:\n\n- At turn 23 (\\(\\delta t = 3\\)), on freeway 1: safe (\\(\\delta t = 3\\) not in 16-19)\n- At turn 24 (\\(\\delta t = 4\\)), on freeway 2: safe (\\(\\delta t = 4\\) not in 16-19)\n- At turn 25 (\\(\\delta t = 5\\)), on freeway 3: safe (\\(\\delta t = 5\\) not in 16-19)\n- At turn 26 (\\(\\delta t = 6\\)), on freeway 4: safe (\\(\\delta t = 6\\) not in {3,4,5,12,13,14})\n- At turn 27 (\\(\\delta t = 7\\)), on freeway 5: safe (\\(\\delta t = 7 \\neq 4\\))\n- At turn 28 (\\(\\delta t = 8\\)), on freeway 6: safe (\\(\\delta t = 8 \\neq 4\\))\n- At turn 29 (\\(\\delta t = 9\\)), on freeway 7: safe (\\(\\delta t = 9 \\neq 4\\))\n- At turn 30 (\\(\\delta t = 10\\)), on freeway 8: safe (\\(\\delta t = 10 \\neq 4\\))\n\nThe position reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 31 after 11 actions.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- Turn 20: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\)\n- Turn 21: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\)\n- Turn 22: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 1\\)\n- Turn 23: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 2\\)\n- Turn 24: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 3\\)\n- Turn 25: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 4\\)\n- Turn 26: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 5\\)\n- Turn 27: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 6\\)\n- Turn 28: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 7\\)\n- Turn 29: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 8\\)\n- Turn 30: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 9\\)\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 30: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway from y=1 to y=8. For each car, we have its head and tail positions at turn t_1, direction, and speed. The car spans move left or right based on the direction and speed.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that turn T. Importantly, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So if they move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T they are still on y, and at turn T+1 they are on y+1.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t_1, and we need to find where they are at future turns.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t = 0 for simplicity, since t_1 is given as 22, but I can think in terms of turns from now. So let τ = T - t_1 be the number of turns elapsed from current turn. So at τ=0, it's turn t_1.\n\nPlayer starts at y=1 at τ=0.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions a_τ for τ=0 to H-1 such that at τ=H-1, y=9, and for each τ, when the player is at y_τ, there is no car on that freeway where 0 is in the car's span at that turn τ (in terms of absolute turn, but since we're using τ, I need to be careful).\n\nSince the car positions depend on time from t_1, let's use τ as the offset.\n\nFor a given turn τ (from start), the absolute turn is t_1 + τ.\n\nPlayer position at turn τ: y_τ\n\nFor collision: at each turn τ, if y_τ is between 1 and 8, then for freeway k = y_τ, we need that for all cars on that freeway, 0 is not in the span at absolute time t_1 + τ.\n\nThe span at time t_1 + τ depends on the initial span at t_1 and the speed.\n\nNow, let's list the cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h=-42, tail τ=-53, direction right, speed s=3.\n\nDirection right means it's moving right, so span at time t: since at t_1, span is [τ, h] = [-53, -42] for right-moving? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: at t_1, span is [τ, h], so head h, tail τ, and since it's moving right, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: span at T is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn this case, all cars seem to be right-moving.\n\nFreeway 1: car with head h=-42, tail τ=-53, direction right, speed 3. So at t_1, span is [τ, h] = [-53, -42]? But in the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\" and for freeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3)\n\nNow, head and tail: for right-moving, I think head is the front, so when moving right, head is larger x, tail is smaller x. So here head is -42, tail is -53, so tail at -53, head at -42, so span is from -53 to -42.\n\nAt time T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-53 + 3(T-t_1), -42 + 3(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-42, -53, right, 3) — identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: also (-42, -53, right, 3) — all first three are the same.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: (-40, -51, right, 4), (-4, -15, right, 4), (32, 21, right, 4)\n\nFor (-40, -51, right, 4): head h=-40, tail τ=-51, so at t_1, span [-51, -40]\n\nAt T, [-51 + 4(T-t_1), -40 + 4(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly, (-4, -15, right, 4): head -4, tail -15, span at t_1: [-15, -4]\n\nAt T: [-15 + 4(T-t_1), -4 + 4(T-t_1)]\n\nAnd (32, 21, right, 4): head 32, tail 21? But tail should be smaller for right-moving? 21 to 32, but head is 32, tail 21, so if moving right, tail at 21, head at 32, so span [21,32] at t_1.\n\nAt T: [21 + 4(T-t_1), 32 + 4(T-t_1)]\n\nBut let's list the spans properly.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (-24, -35, right, 12), (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head -24, tail -35? Tail -35, head -24, so span [-35, -24] at t_1.\n\nAt T: [-35 + 12(T-t_1), -24 + 12(T-t_1)]\n\nSecond car: (24, 13, right, 12): head 24, tail 13, span [13,24] at t_1.\n\nAt T: [13 + 12(T-t_1), 24 + 12(T-t_1)]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5: (-24, -35, right, 12), (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nNow, player starts at y=1 at τ=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, which is above, so probably need to move up.\n\nBut we have to avoid cars on the way.\n\ny=9 has no cars, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nThe collision is only when on freeway y=1 to 8 at that turn, and 0 is in some car's span on that row.\n\nNow, since we start at y=1, and need to go up, we might want to move up quickly, but there might be cars blocking at x=0.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when x=0 is occupied, i.e., when 0 is in the car's span.\n\nFor a car, 0 is in span at time T if for that freeway, at time T, min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nSince the spans are moving, we need to find for each car, the times when it covers x=0.\n\nBut since multiple cars per freeway, we need if any car covers x=0 at that time.\n\nAlso, since the player is at x=0 always, I think, since it's a vertical movement, x doesn't change, only y changes. So position is always (0, y_t).\n\nSo collision when y_t = k for some k=1 to 8, and at time t, on freeway k, there is a car with span containing 0.\n\nSo for each freeway, we need to know the times when it is safe to be on that row, i.e., no car has 0 in span.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, we can find the intervals when x=0 is not covered for each row.\n\nThen the player needs to be on each row only at safe times.\n\nBut the player moves step by step, so we need a path from y=1 at τ=0 to y=9 at some τ, with each position safe at that time.\n\nNow, since we can stay or move up/down, we might need to wait on some rows or go back, but since the goal is up, probably minimal H by going up directly if possible, or waiting when blocked.\n\nFirst, let's analyze each freeway's safety at time τ.\n\nSet τ = T - t_1, so τ is turns from now.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, span at τ: [ -53 + 3τ, -42 + 3τ ]\n\n0 in span if min <= 0 <= max, so -53 + 3τ <= 0 <= -42 + 3τ\n\nWhich is:\n\n-53 + 3τ <= 0 => 3τ <= 53 => τ <= 53/3 ≈ 17.666, so τ <= 17 since integer\n\nAnd 0 <= -42 + 3τ => 42 <= 3τ => τ >= 14\n\nSo for τ=14 to τ=17 inclusive, 0 is covered, unsafe.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2: same car, same span, so same unsafe times τ=14 to 17.\n\nFreeway 3: same, τ=14 to 17 unsafe.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-40, -51, right, 4) → span at τ: [ -51 + 4τ, -40 + 4τ ]\n\n0 in span: -51 + 4τ <= 0 <= -40 + 4τ\n\n-51 + 4τ <= 0 => 4τ <= 51 => τ <= 12.75, so τ <= 12\n\n0 <= -40 + 4τ => 40 <= 4τ => τ >= 10\n\nSo for τ=10 to 12, unsafe for this car.\n\nSecond car: (-4, -15, right, 4) → span [ -15 + 4τ, -4 + 4τ ]\n\n0 in span: -15 + 4τ <= 0 <= -4 + 4τ\n\n-15 + 4τ <= 0 => 4τ <= 15 => τ <= 3.75, τ <= 3\n\n0 <= -4 + 4τ => 4 <= 4τ => τ >= 1\n\nSo for τ=1 to 3, unsafe.\n\nThird car: (32, 21, right, 4) → head 32, tail 21, moving right, span at τ: [21 + 4τ, 32 + 4τ]\n\n0 in span: 21 + 4τ <= 0 <= 32 + 4τ\n\nBut 21 + 4τ > 0 for τ >=0, since 21>0, so min >0, so 0 <= min is false, so 0 never in span because the car is at x>0 and moving right, so x increasing from 21 up, so min x=21+4τ >=21>0, so 0 never covered. Safe from this car always.\n\nSo for freeway 4, unsafe when either first or second car covers x=0.\n\nFirst car unsafe τ=10,11,12\n\nSecond car unsafe τ=1,2,3\n\nThird car always safe.\n\nSo freeway 4 unsafe at τ=1,2,3 and τ=10,11,12\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24, -35, right, 12) → head -24, tail -35, span at τ: [ -35 + 12τ, -24 + 12τ ]\n\n0 in span: -35 + 12τ <= 0 <= -24 + 12τ\n\n-35 + 12τ <= 0 => 12τ <= 35 => τ <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so τ <= 2\n\n0 <= -24 + 12τ => 24 <= 12τ => τ >= 2\n\nSo for τ=2, unsafe? Let's see:\n\nτ >= 2 and τ <= 2.916, so τ=2 only, since τ integer.\n\nτ=2: min = -35 + 24 = -11, max = -24 + 24 = 0\n\nSo min = -11 <= 0 <= 0 = max, yes, 0 is included.\n\nτ=3: min = -35 + 36 =1, max= -24+36=12, min=1>0, so 0 not <= min, not covered.\n\nSimilarly τ=1: min= -35+12= -23, max= -24+12= -12, both negative, max=-12<0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSo only at τ=2, unsafe for this car.\n\nSecond car: (24, 13, right, 12) → head 24, tail 13, span at τ: [13 + 12τ, 24 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span: 13+12τ <= 0 <= 24+12τ\n\nBut 13+12τ >=13>0 for τ>=0, so min >0, 0 not covered. Always safe.\n\nSo for freeway 5, only unsafe at τ=2 due to first car.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as 5, so unsafe only at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same, unsafe τ=2.\n\nFreeway 8: same, unsafe τ=2.\n\nNow, player starts at y=1 at τ=0.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1.\n\nAt τ=0, for freeway 1: is it safe?\n\nFor freeway 1, unsafe at τ=14 to 17, but τ=0 is before that.\n\nAt τ=0, span: min = -53 +0 = -53, max = -42 +0 = -42, both negative, so 0 not in span, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all other times except τ=14-17 are safe for y=1.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no cars, always safe to be there.\n\nBut we start at y=1, need to reach y=9.\n\nThe vertical axis is y=0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 have no cars, I assume.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, probably safe, but we start from y=1.\n\nNow, the minimal number of turns to go from y=1 to y=9 is at least 8 moves up, but since we can stay or move down, but moving down would take more time, so minimal H should be with moving up as much as possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid unsafe times on the rows.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe times for each row:\n\n- y=1: unsafe τ=14,15,16,17\n\n- y=2: same as y=1, since same cars, unsafe τ=14-17\n\n- y=3: same, unsafe τ=14-17\n\n- y=4: unsafe at τ=1,2,3 and τ=10,11,12\n\n- y=5: unsafe only at τ=2\n\n- y=6: unsafe only at τ=2\n\n- y=7: unsafe only at τ=2\n\n- y=8: unsafe only at τ=2\n\nPlayer at τ=0, y=1, which is safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some τ.\n\nSince y=9 is safe always, we just need to be there at τ = H-1 for some H.\n\nThe sequence: at each τ, we choose action to go to y_{τ+1}.\n\nLet y_τ be position at turn τ.\n\nτ=0: y=1\n\nAfter action a_τ, y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy, with Δy based on action.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn based on y_τ and the time.\n\nWe need for each τ, if y_τ between 1 and 8, then it must be safe at that τ.\n\ny_τ is the position at the beginning of the turn, I think, before action.\n\nIn the update, at turn t, position y_t, then we choose action, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAnd collision at turn t if y_t in 1-8 and unsafe at time t.\n\nIn this case, t is absolute, but we use τ.\n\nSo for time τ, position y_τ, must be safe if y_τ in 1-8.\n\nNow, from y=1 to y=9, the minimal vertical distance is 8, so minimal H would be 8 if we move up every turn, but we might need to wait if unsafe.\n\nNow, let's see the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, at τ=0, y=1, safe.\n\nWe can move up or stay or down.\n\nBut moving down to y=0 might be possible, but y=0 has no cars, so safe, but it might not help since we need to go up.\n\nSimilarly, staying might be useful to avoid unsafe times.\n\nNow, let's list when each row is unsafe.\n\ny=1,2,3: unsafe τ=14,15,16,17\n\ny=4: unsafe τ=1,2,3 and 10,11,12\n\ny=5,6,7,8: unsafe only at τ=2\n\nNow, τ=2 is unsafe for y=5,6,7,8.\n\nBut y=4 is unsafe at τ=1,2,3 and 10,11,12.\n\nPlayer starts at τ=0, y=1.\n\nIf we try to go up directly:\n\nAt τ=0, y=1, safe.\n\nAction: U, then y=2 at τ=1\n\nBut at τ=1, y=2, is it safe? y=2 unsafe only at τ=14-17, τ=1 is before, so safe. Freeway 2 at τ=1: span min=-53+3= -50, max=-42+3= -39, both neg, 0 not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly, U again, y=3 at τ=2\n\ny=3 at τ=2: freeway 3, unsafe only τ=14-17, τ=2 is safe. min=-53+6= -47, max=-42+6= -36, both neg, safe.\n\nThen U, y=4 at τ=3\n\nNow y=4 at τ=3: freeway 4 unsafe at τ=1,2,3? τ=3 is unsafe for y=4.\n\ny=4 unsafe at τ=1,2,3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=4 is unsafe.\n\nBut we are at y=4 at τ=3, which is unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\nSo cannot be at y=4 at τ=3.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=4 at τ=1 or τ=2, also unsafe.\n\nBut at τ=0, we start at y=1, if we go U to y=2 at τ=1, then to y=3 at τ=2, then to y=4 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=1, y=2 safe; τ=2 y=3 safe; but τ=3 y=4 unsafe.\n\nIf we stay at y=1 for one turn: at τ=0, y=1 safe, action S, then y=1 at τ=1? Let's sequence.\n\nAt time τ, after action, y_{τ+1} is set, but the position for collision is at the start of the turn.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn τ (offset), player position is y_τ.\n\nWe choose action a_τ, which determines y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy.\n\nThen for collision, at turn τ, we check based on y_τ and time τ.\n\nSimilarly at turn τ+1, based on y_{τ+1} and time τ+1.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t_1 + t, position is y_t, action a_t.\n\nIn terms of offset, for τ from 0 to H-1, we have y_τ and a_τ, with y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δa_τ.\n\ny_0 =1 (given)\n\nWe need y_H =9 for some H.\n\ny_H is at time H, so we reach at turn H.\n\nNow, for each τ=0 to H-1, we need that if y_τ in 1-8, safe at τ.\n\ny_H is at time H, but since y_H=9, no car, no issue.\n\nNow back to direct path: if we go up each turn:\n\nτ=0: y=1, safe\n\na=U, y=2 at τ=1\n\nτ=1: y=2, safe (since y=2 unsafe only 14-17)\n\na=U, y=3 at τ=2\n\nτ=2: y=3, safe (y=3 unsafe only 14-17)\n\na=U, y=4 at τ=3\n\nτ=3: y=4, but y=4 unsafe at τ=3 → collision\n\nProblem at τ=3 on y=4.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=4 at τ=3.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=1 or 2 on y=4 is also unsafe, but we are not there yet.\n\nNow, y=4 is also unsafe at τ=10,11,12, but that's later.\n\nTo go to y=4, we need to be there when not τ=1,2,3,10,11,12.\n\nSafe times for y=4: τ=0,4,5,6,7,8,9,13,... etc.\n\nAt τ=0, we are at y=1, not y=4.\n\nWe need to reach y=4 at some safe time.\n\nSimilarly, other rows have constraints.\n\nNow, for y=5,6,7,8, they are only unsafe at τ=2, so as long as not at τ=2 on those rows, safe.\n\ny=1,2,3 unsafe only at τ=14-17, which is later, so for early times, safe.\n\nNow, since we start at τ=0 y=1, and need to go to y=9, we can go up to y=3 quickly, but then y=4 is unsafe at τ=1,2,3.\n\nτ=1,2,3 are early times.\n\nSafe for y=4 starts from τ=4.\n\nBut we can be at y=3 at τ=2, for example.\n\nLet's list possible actions.\n\nOption: stay at y=1 for a few turns, but y=1 is safe except τ=14-17, which is far, so at τ=0,1,2,... it is safe.\n\nBut staying will increase H.\n\nGo to y=2 or y=3 and wait.\n\ny=2 and y=3 are safe at early times.\n\nBut we need to cross y=4 when safe.\n\ny=4 safe at τ=4,5,6,7,8,9,13,... but τ=10,11,12 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, after y=4, we have y=5 to y=8, which are only unsafe at τ=2, so if we are not on them at τ=2, fine.\n\nSince τ=2 is early, and we are at τ=0 now, we might pass y=5-8 after τ=2.\n\nNow, minimal H: if we can go directly but avoid y=4 at τ=3.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, y=1, instead of going up, we stay or something.\n\nBut let's see the times.\n\nWe are at y=1 at τ=0.\n\nIf we stay at y=1: a=S, then y=1 at τ=1\n\nThen at τ=1, y=1, safe.\n\nThen we can go U to y=2 at τ=2? After action at τ=1, y_{τ=2} = y_1 + Δa_1\n\nAt τ=1, position y=1, we choose a_1.\n\nIf a_1=U, then y_2 =2\n\nThen at τ=2, y=2, safe.\n\nThen a_2=U, y_3=3, at τ=3, y=3, safe.\n\nThen we need to go to y=4, but at τ=3, y=4 would be unsafe if we go there.\n\nFrom y=3 at τ=3, if we go U, y_4=4 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=4: is it safe?\n\ny=4 unsafe at τ=10,11,12, but τ=4 not in, and not τ=1,2,3, so τ=4 is safe for y=4.\n\ny=4 unsafe at τ=1,2,3,10,11,12, so τ=4 is safe.\n\nYes.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nτ=0: y=1, safe, action a=U? Let's list step by step.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=1\n\nChoose a_0: if a_0=U, then y_1=2\n\nThen at τ=1, y=2, safe (since not 14-17)\n\nChoose a_1: if U, then y_2=3\n\nAt τ=2, y=3, safe\n\nChoose a_2: if U, then y_3=4\n\nAt τ=3, y=3, but y_3=4? Position at τ=3 is y_3.\n\nIf at τ=2, we set y_3 = y_2 + Δa_2\n\ny_2=3, if a_2=U, then y_3=4\n\nThen at turn τ=3, position y_3=4, and time τ=3, which is unsafe for y=4.\n\nCollision.\n\nBut if at τ=2, we do not go up, but stay or something.\n\nAt τ=2, y=3, we can choose S, then y_3=3\n\nThen at τ=3, y=3, which is safe (since y=3 unsafe only 14-17)\n\nThen at τ=3, we can choose U, then y_4=4\n\nAt τ=4, y=4, and time τ=4, which is safe for y=4.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nNow, after y=4 at τ=4, we need to go to y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 are unsafe only at τ=2, but τ=4 is after τ=2, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 no issue.\n\nSo from y=4 at τ=4, we can go up each turn.\n\nLet's write the sequence.\n\nτ=0: y=1, safe. Action a_0: let's choose U? But if we choose U immediately, we get to y=4 at τ=3 unsafe.\n\nIn the sequence above, we need to delay.\n\nFrom start:\n\nτ=0: position y=1, safe. Action: we can choose S to stay, or U to go up.\n\nIf we choose U: then y_1=2\n\nτ=1: position y=2, safe. Action: if we choose U, y_2=3\n\nτ=2: position y=3, safe. Action: here we cannot choose U immediately, because if U, y_3=4 at τ=3 unsafe.\n\nSo at τ=2, we choose S (stay), so y_3=3\n\nThen τ=3: position y=3, safe. Action: choose U, so y_4=4\n\nτ=4: position y=4, now τ=4, safe (since not 1,2,3,10,11,12)\n\nThen from here, we can go up:\n\nAction U, y_5=5\n\nτ=5: y=5, safe (since not τ=2)\n\nAction U, y_6=6\n\nτ=6: y=6, safe\n\nAction U, y_7=7\n\nτ=7: y=7, safe\n\nAction U, y_8=8\n\nτ=8: y=8, safe (not τ=2)\n\nAction U, y_9=9\n\nτ=9: position y=9, reached.\n\nSo at τ=9, y=9.\n\nNow, number of turns H: from τ=0 to τ=9, that's 10 turns? τ from 0 to 9, positions from y1 to y9, but with one stay.\n\ny at τ=0:1, τ=1:2, τ=2:3, τ=3:3 (stay), τ=4:4, τ=5:5, τ=6:6, τ=7:7, τ=8:8, τ=9:9.\n\nSo we reached at τ=9.\n\nH is the number of actions, from τ=0 to τ=H-1, with y_H=9.\n\nHere, actions from τ=0 to τ=8? Let's index.\n\nActions: a_τ for τ=0 to H-1, y_H=9.\n\nIn this case, y_0=1\n\nAfter a_0, y_1=2 (if U)\n\nAfter a_1, y_2=3 (U)\n\nAfter a_2, y_3=3 (S, since stayed)\n\nAfter a_3, y_4=4 (U)\n\nAfter a_4, y_5=5 (U)\n\nAfter a_5, y_6=6 (U)\n\nAfter a_6, y_7=7 (U)\n\nAfter a_7, y_8=8 (U)\n\nAfter a_8, y_9=9 (U)\n\nThen at τ=9, y=9, so we have H=9 actions? Actions from τ=0 to τ=8, that's 9 actions, y from 1 to 9 in 9 steps, but with one stay, so y increased by 8 in 9 steps.\n\nMinimal without obstacles is 8 steps, but here we have one extra stay to avoid the unsafe time.\n\nNow, is this minimal? Perhaps we can do with less.\n\nFor example, if we go directly but skip the unsafe time.\n\nAnother way: go to y=4 later, but at τ=4 we are at y=4, which is fine.\n\nBut we started at τ=0, and reached at τ=9.\n\nTotal turns from start to end: 9 turns.\n\nSince we need to be at y=4 not at τ=3, but at τ=4 or later safe time.\n\nIn this case, we arrived at y=4 at τ=4.\n\nCould we arrive earlier? τ=4 is the earliest safe time for y=4 after start.\n\nSafe times: τ=0, but at τ=0 we are at y=1, not y=4.\n\nτ=1,2,3 unsafe, so next safe is τ=4.\n\nSo we must be at y=4 at τ=4 or later.\n\nIn the above, we are at y=4 at τ=4.\n\nThen we go up to y=9 in 5 more steps: y=4 to5,5to6,6to7,7to8,8to9, that's 5 actions, from τ=4 to τ=9, 5 steps.\n\nBut from start to y=4: from y=1 to y=4, with one stay, in 4 steps: τ=0 to τ=3 we are at y=3, then to y=4 at τ=4.\n\ny positions: τ=0:1, τ=1:2, τ=2:3, τ=3:3, τ=4:4. So from τ=0 to τ=4, we are at y=4, that took 4 turns to increase by 3, with one stay.\n\nMinimal to go from y=1 to y=4 is 3 moves, but we took 4 turns because of stay.\n\nThen from y=4 to y=9: 5 moves, no stay needed.\n\nTotal turns: 4 to reach y=4, then 5 to y=9, but reaching y=4 at τ=4, then actions to go up to y=9 at τ=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from τ=0 to τ=8 for actions, 9 actions.\n\nH=9.\n\nBut perhaps we can reduce by not staying or moving differently.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=0 and wait, but y=0 has no cars, safe, but then we need to go up later, might take more time.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, y=1, go D to y=0 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=0, safe.\n\nThen we can stay or go up.\n\nBut y=0 to y=1, then up.\n\nBut y=1 at τ=1 is safe, as before.\n\nBut then we might reach later.\n\nFor instance: τ=0: y=1, a=D, y_1=0\n\nτ=1: y=0, safe, a=U, y_2=1\n\nτ=2: y=1, safe, a=U, y_3=2\n\nτ=3: y=2, safe, a=U, y_4=3\n\nτ=4: y=3, safe, a=U, y_5=4\n\nAt τ=5: y=4, and τ=5, is it safe? y=4 safe at τ=5, yes.\n\nThen from y=4 at τ=5, go up to y=9 at τ=10? y=4 to5 at τ=6, to6 τ=7, to7 τ=8, to8 τ=9, to9 τ=10.\n\nSo reached at τ=10, which is later than 9. Worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nAt τ=0, stay at y=1: a=S, y_1=1\n\nτ=1: y=1, a=U, y_2=2\n\nτ=2: y=2, a=U, y_3=3\n\nτ=3: y=3, a=S? Or U.\n\nIf at τ=3, y=3, we can go U to y_4=4 at τ=4.\n\nSame as first sequence.\n\nAt τ=3, if we go U, y_4=4 at τ=4 safe.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nIn first sequence, we have one stay at τ=2.\n\nBut in the sequence I had: at τ=2, we stayed, so y_3=3.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=3, go U to y_4=4 at τ=4.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, is there a way to avoid the stay?\n\nFor example, if we go faster or slower.\n\nBut from y=1 to y=4, minimal 3 moves, but at τ=3, y=4 is unsafe, so we cannot be at y=4 at τ=3.\n\nWe must be at y=4 at τ=4 or later.\n\nBut at τ=4, we can be at y=4.\n\nTo be at y=4 at τ=4, we need to come from y=3 or y=5 or y=4 stay.\n\nBut y=5 at τ=3? But at τ=3, we are at y=3 if we go up.\n\nWe can only reach y=4 at τ=4 from y=3 at τ=3 or y=4 at τ=3 or y=5 at τ=3.\n\nBut y=4 at τ=3 unsafe, y=5 at τ=3: y=5 is freeway 5, unsafe at τ=2, but τ=3 is safe, so y=5 at τ=3 is safe.\n\nBut how to be at y=5 at τ=3?\n\nAt τ=0, y=1, we need to go up to y=5 in 3 steps? y=1 to2,2to3,3to4,4to5? But to y=5 at τ=3, that would require from y=1 to y=5 in 3 actions: e.g. a_0=U, y_1=2; a_1=U, y_2=3; a_2=U, y_3=4? Then at τ=3, y=4, which is unsafe.\n\nCannot reach y=5 directly in 3 steps from y=1.\n\nMinimal to y=5 is 4 steps: τ=0:y1, a0=U, y1=2; τ=1:y2, a1=U, y2=3; τ=2:y3, a2=U, y3=4; τ=3:y4, a3=U, y4=5 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=3, y=4, which is unsafe if τ=3.\n\nIn this case, at τ=3, y=4 unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, we need to not be on y=4 at τ=3.\n\nBut if we go directly, we are on y=4 at τ=3.\n\nThe only way is to be slower, like having a stay or move down, but moving down might not help.\n\nSo the first sequence with one stay seems necessary.\n\nAnother possibility: go to y=4 at τ=4 from y=3 at τ=3, which is what we have.\n\nPerhaps at τ=0, go U to y=2 at τ=1; then at τ=1, go U to y=3 at τ=2; then at τ=2, instead of stay, we could go down? But go down to y=2, then at τ=3 y=2, then go up, but then we reach later.\n\nFor example: τ=0: y1, a=U, y=2 τ=1\n\nτ=1: y2, a=U, y=3 τ=2\n\nτ=2: y3, a=D? Then y=2 at τ=3? a=D, Δy=-1, so y_{3} = y_2 -1 = 3-1=2\n\nThen τ=3: y=2, safe, then a=U, y=3 at τ=4? y_{4}=3\n\nThen at τ=4, y=3, then a=U, y=4 at τ=5\n\nThen y=4 at τ=5, safe, then go up to y=9 at τ=10, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nTherefore, the first sequence with one stay at y=3 is efficient.\n\nNow, in that sequence, we have to go through y=5 to y=8, which are safe except τ=2, but we pass them after τ=4, which is fine.\n\nIn the sequence: after y=4 at τ=4, we go up to y=5 at τ=5, which is after τ=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nNow, H=9, with actions: let's list.\n\nτ=0: a_0 = U  // to y=2\n\nIn terms of actions for turns.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1=22.\n\nSo for turn t_1 + t, but t from 0.\n\nSet t as offset, t=0,1,2,... for turns from t_1.\n\nSo turn 22: position y=1, action a\n\nThen turn 23: position y=2, action, etc.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt turn 22 (τ=0): position y=1, we choose action U, so next position y=2 at turn 23.\n\nThen turn 23 (τ=1): position y=2, action U, next y=3 at turn 24.\n\nThen turn 24 (τ=2): position y=3, action S (stay), so next position y=3 at turn 25.\n\nThen turn 25 (τ=3): position y=3, action U, next y=4 at turn 26.\n\nThen turn 26 (τ=4): position y=4, action U, next y=5 at turn 27.\n\nThen turn 27 (τ=5): position y=5, action U, next y=6 at turn 28.\n\nThen turn 28 (τ=6): position y=6, action U, next y=7 at turn 29.\n\nThen turn 29 (τ=7): position y=7, action U, next y=8 at turn 30.\n\nThen turn 30 (τ=8): position y=8, action U, next y=9 at turn 31.\n\nAt turn 31, position y=9, reached.\n\nSo the actions are from turn 22 to turn 30, for H=9 actions? Actions at turn 22 to 30, that's 9 actions.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn this case, actions at: turn 22 (t=0), 23 (t=1), ..., up to turn 30 (t=8), so t from 0 to 8, H=9.\n\ny reached at turn 31, which is t_1 + 9.\n\nMinimal H is 9.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose we go to y=4 at τ=4, as before.\n\nBut from y=4 to y=9, 5 moves.\n\nFrom start to y=4 at τ=4: with one stay, 4 moves (actions at τ=0,1,2,3 to reach position at τ=4).\n\nActions: τ=0: action to go to position at τ=1\n\nAfter H actions, position at time H.\n\nWith H actions, we can be at position after H steps.\n\nStart at time 0, position y=1.\n\nAfter first action, time 1, position y1.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, time k, position y_k.\n\nWe need y_H =9 for some H.\n\nIn the sequence, at time τ, position y_τ.\n\nAfter action a_τ, y_{τ+1} set.\n\ny_0=1\n\ny_H=9\n\nFor each τ from 0 to H-1, we need y_τ safe if in 1-8.\n\nIn our case, y_0=1 safe, y_1=2 safe, y_2=3 safe, y_3=3 safe (since we stayed), y_4=4 safe, y_5=5 safe, ..., y_8=8 safe, y_9=9.\n\ny_τ for τ=0 to 8, all safe when applicable.\n\nH=9.\n\nTo have smaller H, say H=8.\n\nThen y_8=9.\n\ny_0=1, so need to increase by 8 in 8 steps, so must move up every turn, no down or stay.\n\nThen sequence: y_1=2, y_2=3, y_3=4, y_4=5, ..., y_8=9.\n\nNow, at τ=3, y_3=4, which must be safe, but y=4 at τ=3 is unsafe, collision.\n\nThus impossible with H=8.\n\nSimilarly, H=9 is minimal possible with one stay.\n\nIf we can avoid y=4 at τ=3 by other means, but since we must pass through y=4, and τ=3 is the only time we would be there in minimal path, we need to delay.\n\nThus H=9 is minimal.\n\nNow, about other rows: y=5 to 8 only unsafe at τ=2, but in our path, we are on y=5 at τ=5, after τ=2, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nIn the sequence, we have action at turn 24 (τ=2) as S, stay.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=22.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: S\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nAfter turn 30 action, position at turn 31 is y=9.\n\nIn the action list, up to turn 30.\n\nThe sequence should be for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn the box.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 4, there is a car at (32,21,right,4) which we said is always safe, and others.\n\nBut in our path, we are on y=4 at τ=4, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nNow, but let's confirm the time for y=4 at τ=4.\n\nτ=4, absolute time t_1 + τ =22+4=26.\n\nFreeway 4 cars:\n\nFirst car: at T, span [ -51 +4(T-22), -40 +4(T-22) ]\n\nAt T=26, τ=4, [ -51 + 16, -40 +16] = [-35, -24], both negative, 0 not covered.\n\nSecond car: [ -15 +4(τ), -4 +4(τ) ] at τ=4, [-15+16, -4+16]= [1,12], min=1>0, 0 not covered.\n\nThird car: [21 +4τ, 32+4τ] at τ=4, [21+16,32+16]=[37,48], not near 0.\n\nSafe.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut the answer format is for actions from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=9, so turns 22 to 30.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: S\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 25: action U to go from y=3 to y=4.\n\nPosition at turn 25 is y=3 (after previous action), then action U, so to y=4 at turn 26.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the list, it should be clear.\n\nNow, about the cars on freeway 5-8, unsafe at τ=2, but we pass after, no issue.\n\nAnother thing: in the beginning, we start at y=1, which is safe at τ=0.\n\nAnd we move up.\n\nBut is there a way to go faster by not going to y=3 immediately?\n\nFor example, at τ=0, y=1, if we stay, then later go up, but might be slower.\n\nSuppose at τ=0, stay: a=S, y=1 at τ=1\n\nThen at τ=1, y=1, go U to y=2 at τ=2\n\nThen at τ=2, y=2, go U to y=3 at τ=3\n\nThen at τ=3, y=3, go U to y=4 at τ=4\n\nSame as before, but we started with stay instead of moving, so we reached y=4 at τ=4 still, but now we stayed at y=1 instead of moving to y=2, so at τ=1 we are y=1, not y=2, so we lost a step.\n\nThen to go from y=4 to y=9, same, so reached at τ=10 or something, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nThus, the sequence with moving up first and staying at y=3 is best.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=9.\n\nNow, write the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 22\\) is 9, with the sequence of actions starting from turn 22 to turn 30.\n\nThe sequence avoids collisions by ensuring the player is not on a freeway \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) when any car on that freeway has a span containing \\(x = 0\\) at the corresponding turn. Specifically:\n- At turn 24 (\\(\\tau = 2\\) relative to start), the player stays at \\(y = 3\\) to avoid being on \\(y = 4\\) at turn 25 (\\(\\tau = 3\\)), as \\(y = 4\\) is unsafe at \\(\\tau = 3\\) due to cars on freeway 4.\n- All other actions move the player upward, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 31.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n- Turn 22: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 2\\)\n- Turn 23: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 3\\)\n- Turn 24: Stay (\\(S\\)) at \\(y = 3\\) (to avoid unsafe \\(y = 4\\) at \\(\\tau = 3\\))\n- Turn 25: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 4\\)\n- Turn 26: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 5\\)\n- Turn 27: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 6\\)\n- Turn 28: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 7\\)\n- Turn 29: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 8\\)\n- Turn 30: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 9\\)\n\nAt turn 31, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\), and since \\(y = 9\\) has no cars, no collision occurs.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 22: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 30: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0,3) on turn 24. I need to get to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The vertical axis goes from 0 to 9, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, but we need to end at (0,9).\n\nThe player moves up, down, or stays with actions U, D, S. Each action changes y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay within 0 to 9.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each freeway has cars with positions given at turn t1=24. The position is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For left-moving cars, the span is [h, τ] where h and τ are positions, and for right-moving, it's [τ, h]. But in the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed), so I need to interpret that.\n\nLooking at the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → moves left, so at time T, span is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → moves right, so [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the car state, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). I think \"head\" and \"tail\" are defined based on direction.\n\nFor a right-moving car, the head is the front, which is at a higher x, so when moving right, head increases. Similarly for left.\n\nIn the span notation, for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is the tail (left end), h is the head (right end). And it moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], so h is head (left end?), but when moving left, head decreases, so in [h, τ], if h is head and it's decreasing, but in the notation, it says for left-moving: [h, τ] with h and τ, and it becomes [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if h is the head and it's decreasing, that makes sense for left-moving.\n\nBut in the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed), so for a given direction, head and tail are specified.\n\nFor example, take freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3)\n\nDirection is right, so this is a right-moving car. For right-moving, the span should be [tail, head], but here it's given as (head, tail), so head is -36, tail is -47. Since it's right-moving, the tail should be the left end, head right end. -47 is less than -36, so tail = -47, head = -36, so span is [-47, -36] at t1=24? No.\n\nAccording to the direction: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head. In the tuple, it's (head, tail, dir, speed), so (h, τ, d, s).\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: (head = -36, tail = -47, right, 3)\n\nSince direction is right, the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-47, -36]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [head, tail] but with head > tail or something? But in this case, all cars seem to have head and tail such that for right-moving, tail < head, and for left, probably head < tail or something, but here all directions are right, so no left-moving cars in this state.\n\nLet's list all cars:\n\nFreeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3) → direction right, so span at t1=24: [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nFreeway 2: same (-36, -47, right, 3) → [-47, -36]\n\nFreeway 3: same (-36, -47, right, 3) → [-47, -36]\n\nFreeway 4: (-32, -43, right, 4), (4, -7, right, 4), (40, 29, right, 4) → for each: direction right, so span [τ, h]\n\nFirst car: tail=-43, head=-32 → [-43, -32]\n\nSecond car: tail=-7, head=4 → [-7, 4]\n\nThird car: tail=29, head=40? But tail=29, head=40, so [29,40], but it's moving right, so [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nBut tail=29, head=40, so τ=29, h=40, so [29,40] at t1.\n\nIn the tuple it's (head, tail), so for third car: (40, 29, right, 4), so head=40, tail=29, so for right-moving, span is [tail, head] = [29,40]\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=4, tail=-7, so [ -7, 4]\n\nFirst car: head=-32, tail=-43, so [ -43, -32]\n\nFreeway 5: (0, -11, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head=0, tail=-11, direction right, so span [τ,h] = [-11, 0]\n\nSecond car: head=48, tail=37, so [37,48]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5: (0, -11, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12) → [-11,0] and [37,48]\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on that freeway at turn T, meaning y_T = k for some freeway k=1 to 8, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you only care about the freeway you are currently on when checking collision at turn T.\n\nSpecifically: at turn T, if y_T = k (for k=1-8), and for some car on freeway k, 0 is in its span at time T, then collision.\n\nIf you are moving, at turn T you are at y_T, and you might move to y_{T+1} at the end of the turn, but for collision, it's based on where you are during the turn, I think.\n\nThe note clarifies: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so for collision at turn T, you only check the freeway y_T.\n\nSimilarly, when you arrive at y_{T+1}, that's for turn T+1.\n\nSo for each turn, we need to ensure that for the y position at that turn, if it's between 1 and 8, 0 is not in any car span on that row at that time.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=3 at t=24.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is the top, and no cars there, it's safe.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H to reach y=9 from y=3 is at least 6, since each U move increases y by 1, so with all U, it would take 6 moves: from 3 to 4,5,6,7,8,9 in 6 steps.\n\nBut I might have to wait or move down to avoid cars, which could increase H.\n\nSo H >=6, but could be more if I need to avoid.\n\nNow, I need to check for each freeway and each future time, where the cars are, specifically when the span covers x=0.\n\nThe collision is when 0 is in the span, meaning the car covers x=0 at that time.\n\nFor each car, the span at time T is given by the movement.\n\nLet Δt = T - t1 = T - 24\n\nFor a car, at time T, span depends on direction and speed.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1: one car, right-moving, s=3, span at t1: [ -47, -36]\n\nAt time T, span = [ -47 + 3*(T-24), -36 + 3*(T-24) ] because moving right, so τ + sΔT, h + sΔT, with τ=-47, h=-36\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3, same car, all identical? Freeway 1,2,3 all have the same car: (-36,-47,right,3) so same span.\n\nBut they are on different freeways, so I need to consider each separately.\n\nNow, 0 is in span when min <= 0 <= max.\n\nFor freeway 1 car: span at T: [ -47 + 3(Δt), -36 + 3(Δt) ] where Δt = T-24\n\nSet min <= 0 <= max:\n\n-47 + 3Δt <= 0 <= -36 + 3Δt\n\nNow, -47 + 3Δt <= 0 => 3Δt <= 47 => Δt <= 47/3 ≈ 15.666, so Δt <= 15 since integer? Time is discrete, turns are integers, so T integer, Δt integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -36 + 3Δt => 3Δt >= 36 => Δt >= 12\n\nSo for Δt >=12 and Δt <=15, 0 is in span for freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3, same thing.\n\nNow for freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-32,-43,right,4) → tail=-43, head=-32, so span at t1: [-43,-32]\n\nAt T: [ -43 + 4Δt, -32 + 4Δt ]\n\n0 in span: -43 + 4Δt <= 0 <= -32 + 4Δt\n\nLeft: -43 + 4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=43 => Δt <= 10.75, so Δt <=10\n\nRight: 0 <= -32 + 4Δt => 4Δt >=32 => Δt >=8\n\nSo for Δt=8,9,10\n\nSecond car: (4,-7,right,4) → head=4, tail=-7, span at t1: [-7,4]\n\nAt T: [ -7 + 4Δt, 4 + 4Δt ]\n\n0 in span: -7 + 4Δt <= 0 <= 4 + 4Δt\n\nNow, -7 + 4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=7 => Δt <= 1.75, so Δt <=1\n\n0 <= 4 + 4Δt always true since 4+4Δt >=4>0 for Δt>=0\n\nBut left inequality: -7 +4Δt <=0 only for Δt <=1\n\nAnd right: 0 <=4+4Δt always true for Δt integer >=0.\n\nBut for 0 to be <= max, max is 4+4Δt, which is always >=4>0, so only constraint is min <=0, i.e. -7 +4Δt <=0\n\nSo for Δt <=1, 0 is in span? Let's see:\n\nAt Δt=0, T=24, min=-7, max=4, so -7<=0<=4, yes 0 in span.\n\nAt Δt=1, T=25, min= -7+4= -3, max=4+4=8, -3<=0<=8, yes.\n\nAt Δt=2, T=26, min= -7+8=1, max=4+8=12, min=1>0, so 0 not <= min, so 0 not in span since 0 < min.\n\nSimilarly for higher.\n\nSo only for Δt=0 and Δt=1, i.e. T=24 and T=25.\n\nBut at T=24, we are at turn 24, player is at y=3, and freeway 4 is y=4? Freeway k corresponds to row y=k.\n\nFreeways are y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nSo for freeway 4, at T=24 and T=25, the second car has 0 in span.\n\nNow third car on freeway 4: (40,29,right,4) → head=40, tail=29, span at t1: [29,40]\n\nAt T: [29+4Δt, 40+4Δt], min=29+4Δt >=29>0 for all Δt>=0, so 0 never in span, since min >0.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst: (0,-11,right,12) → head=0, tail=-11, so span [ -11, 0] at t1? Direction right, so [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [ -11 + 12Δt, 0 + 12Δt ] = [ -11 +12Δt, 12Δt ]\n\n0 in span: min <=0 <= max\n\nmin = -11 +12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <=11 => Δt <= 11/12 <1, so Δt=0 only since Δt integer.\n\nAt Δt=0, min=-11, max=0, so -11<=0<=0, yes 0 in span.\n\nAt Δt=1, min= -11+12=1, max=12, min=1>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, max=12Δt >=0 always.\n\nSo only at Δt=0, T=24.\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,12) → head=48, tail=37, span [37,48] at t1, at T [37+12Δt,48+12Δt], min>0, never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly for freeways 6,7,8, all have the same cars as freeway 5: one car with span [-11,0] at t1, so only at T=24, 0 in span for that car, and another car that never covers 0.\n\nFor freeway 5 at T=24, the first car has span [-11,0], so 0 is included (since head=0).\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when 0 is covered by some car.\n\nFreeway 1: covered when Δt=12 to 15, i.e. T=36 to 39\n\nFreeway 2: same, T=36 to 39\n\nFreeway 3: same, T=36 to 39\n\nFreeway 4:\n\n- First car: covered Δt=8 to10, T=32 to34\n\n- Second car: covered Δt=0 to1, T=24 to25\n\n- Third car: never\n\nSo overall for freeway 4, covered when T=24,25 (from second car) or T=32,33,34 (from first car)\n\nT=24,25 and 32,33,34.\n\nFreeway 5:\n\n- First car: covered only at T=24 (Δt=0)\n\n- Second car: never\n\nSo covered only at T=24\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6,7,8: same as 5, covered only at T=24\n\nNow, player starts at t=24, y=3.\n\nAt t=24, y=3, which is freeway 3? y=3 is freeway k=3.\n\nFreeway k corresponds to row y=k, so at y=3, we are on freeway 3.\n\nNow, at t=24, for freeway 3, is 0 covered? From above, freeway 3 has a car that covers 0 only from T=36 to39, not at T=24.\n\nFor freeway 3, the car is similar to freeway 1, which is only covered at T=36-39, not at 24.\n\nAt T=24, for freeway 3, car span: from above, for freeway 1,2,3 at T=24, span [-47,-36], min=-47, max=-36, both negative, so 0 not in span. Similarly.\n\nBut for freeway 4 at T=24, covered, but player is not on freeway 4 at t=24.\n\nPlayer at t=24 is on y=3.\n\nNow, collision at turn T if y_T = k and for freeway k, 0 in some car span at T.\n\nSo at t=24, y=3, freeway 3: at T=24, cars: span [-47,-36], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nBut for freeway 5,6,7,8 at T=24, covered, but player not on them.\n\nNow, I need to move from y=3 to y=9.\n\nThe direct path: move up each turn.\n\nStart t=24, y=3\n\nAction U: t=25, y=4\n\nBut at t=25, y=4, which is freeway 4.\n\nNow, freeway 4 at t=25: from above, second car covers at T=25? For freeway 4, second car: covered at T=24 and 25.\n\nAt T=25, Δt=1, span: min=-7+4= -3, max=4+4=8, so [ -3,8], 0 is in, since -3<=0<=8.\n\nSo at t=25, if player is on y=4, collision.\n\nTherefore, cannot be on y=4 at t=25.\n\nIf I do U at t=24, to y=4 at t=25, but at t=25, y=4 and 0 in span, collision.\n\nSo I cannot move up immediately.\n\nI could stay or move down.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince at t=24, y=3 is safe, I could stay at y=3 for a while.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, let's see the danger times for each row.\n\nList for each y=k, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., 0 covered.\n\ny=1 (freeway 1): unsafe T=36,37,38,39\n\ny=2: same, T=36-39\n\ny=3: same, T=36-39\n\ny=4: from above, unsafe at T=24,25 (from second car), and T=32,33,34 (from first car)\n\ny=5: unsafe only at T=24\n\ny=6: only T=24\n\ny=7: only T=24\n\ny=8: only T=24\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nNow, player at t=24, y=3, safe.\n\nI need to get to y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal turns: if I can go directly, but at t=25, if I go to y=4, unsafe.\n\nIf I go to y=2: action D, to y=2 at t=25.\n\ny=2 at t=25: is it safe? y=2 unsafe only at T=36-39, not at 25, so should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 unsafe at 25, but y=2 is safe.\n\nThen from y=2, I could go up or stay.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9, so probably up.\n\nBut at t=25, if I am at y=2, safe.\n\nThen I can go to y=3 at t=26, or y=1, or stay.\n\nBut y=1 at t=26 is safe, since unsafe only later.\n\nBut I need to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nAlso, for y=4, unsafe at T=24,25,32,33,34\n\nT=24 and 25 are early, then safe until T=32-34.\n\nSimilarly, y=5-8 unsafe only at T=24, so after t=24, they are safe except for the future times for y=1,2,3.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 are unsafe only at T=24, so for T>24, they are safe, since no cars cover 0 after that.\n\nFor example, y=5 at T=25: freeway 5 cars, first car at T=25, Δt=1, span [ -11+12, 0+12] = [1,12], min=1>0, so 0 not in span. Similarly for others. So after T=24, y=5-8 are always safe.\n\ny=4 is unsafe at T=24,25 and T=32,33,34.\n\ny=1,2,3 unsafe at T=36-39.\n\nNow, back to player.\n\nAt t=24, y=3, safe.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nOne way is to go down to y=2 or something to avoid y=4 at t=25.\n\nFor example:\n\nOption: at t=24, action S: stay, so y=3 at t=25.\n\nt=25, y=3: is it safe? y=3 unsafe only at T=36-39, not at 25, so safe.\n\nThen at t=25, I can choose action.\n\nIf I go U to y=4 at t=26.\n\nBut at t=26, y=4: what time? T=26.\n\ny=4 unsafe at T=24,25,32,33,34. T=26 not in, so should be safe? Let's confirm.\n\nFreeway 4 at T=26, Δt=2.\n\nFirst car: span at T: [ -43 +4*2, -32 +4*2] = [ -43+8, -32+8] = [-35,-24], min=-35<0, max=-24<0, so 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [ -7 +4*2, 4+8] = [1,12], min=1>0, not.\n\nThird car: [29+8,40+8]=[37,48], not.\n\nSo safe at T=26.\n\nSimilarly, T=27 to31 should be safe for y=4, except at T=32,33,34.\n\nT=26 to31 safe for y=4.\n\nThen at t=26, y=4 safe.\n\nThen I can go up to y=5 at t=27.\n\ny=5 at t=27: since after T=24, y=5 always safe, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, to y=6 at t=28, y=7 at t=29, y=8 at t=30, y=9 at t=31.\n\nBut at t=31, y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, H is the number of turns from t1 to the turn when we reach y=9.\n\nStart at t=24, position (0,3)\n\nAfter first action at t=24, we move to next position at t=25.\n\nSequence of actions from t=24 to t=24+H-1, and at turn t=24+H-1, we are at (0,9).\n\nThe position after H actions: after action at t=24, position at t=25; after action at t=25, position at t=26; ... after action at t=24+H-1, position at t=24+H.\n\nBut we need to reach (0,9) at some turn, say at turn T, with y_T=9.\n\nAfter the sequence of actions, at the end of the last action, we are at (0,9).\n\nThe turn when we are at (0,9) is the turn after the last action.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nAt turn t, we are at position (0, y_t), and we take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at turn t1=24, y_{24}=3.\n\nWe take actions a_{24}, a_{25}, ..., a_{24+H-1}\n\nThen after a_{24+H-1}, we have y_{24+H} =9.\n\nAnd we need to be safe at each turn t from 24 to 24+H-1? No.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn when we are on a freeway.\n\nSpecifically, for each turn T from 24 to 24+H-1, we are at y_T, and if 1<= y_T <=8, we need no collision on that freeway at time T.\n\nAt the turn when we reach y=9, which is turn 24+H, if H is such that we reach at turn T=24+H, then at that turn, we are on y=9, which is safe, no issue.\n\nBut during the actions, from turn 24 to 24+H-1, we are at positions y_{24} to y_{24+H-1}, and we need to be safe at those turns.\n\nFor example, at turn 24, we are at y_{24}=3, safe as above.\n\nAfter action a_{24}, we go to y_{25}, and at turn 25, we are at y_{25}, need safe, and so on, up to turn 24+H-1, we are at y_{24+H-1}, need safe, and then after a_{24+H-1}, we are at y_{24+H}=9.\n\nAt turn 24+H, we are at y=9, safe, so no need to check collision since no freeway.\n\nSo we need safety for turns t=24,25,26,...,24+H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, for each action time, but the position is during the turn.\n\nBack to the plan.\n\nIn my earlier idea: if I stay at t=24, action S, so y_{25} = y_{24} =3 (since S, no change).\n\nAfter action S at t=24, y_{25} = y_{24} +0 =3.\n\nAt turn 25, we are at y=3, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen at t=25, action U, so y_{26} = y_{25} +1 =4.\n\nAt turn 26, we are at y=4? Turn 26 position is y_{26}.\n\nAfter action at t=25, we set y_{26}.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, take a_t, go to y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nFor collision at turn t, we check based on y_t and time t.\n\nIn this case:\n\nTurn 24: y=3, safe\n\nAction a_{24}: S, so y_{25} =3\n\nTurn 25: y=3, safe (since y=3 unsafe only later)\n\nAction a_{25}: U, so y_{26} =3+1=4\n\nTurn 26: y=4? At turn 26, position y_{26}=4.\n\nNow, time T=26, y=4, which is freeway 4, and as above, at T=26, safe, since not unsafe time.\n\nThen action a_{26}: U, to y_{27}=5\n\nTurn 27: y=5, which is safe (after T=24)\n\nSimilarly, a_{27}: U, y_{28}=6, turn 28: y=6, safe\n\na_{28}: U, y_{29}=7, turn 29: y=7, safe\n\na_{29}: U, y_{30}=8, turn 30: y=8, safe (since after T=24)\n\na_{30}: U, y_{31}=9, turn 31: y=9, safe.\n\nNow, at turn 31, we are at y=9, so we have reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=24 to t=30, that's 7 actions: a24 to a30.\n\nt=24,25,26,27,28,29,30: 7 turns of actions.\n\nStarted at t=24, after 7 actions, at t=31, y=9.\n\nH=7.\n\nBut is this minimal? Earlier I thought min 6, but with all U, from y=3 to y=9 in 6 moves: actions at t=24 to t=29, y from 3 to 4,5,6,7,8,9 at t=30.\n\nBut in that case, at t=25, y=4, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nWith S first, then U, I have 7 actions.\n\nBut perhaps I can go down first to avoid, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=24, go D to y=2 at t=25.\n\nTurn 25: y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=25, I can go U to y=3 at t=26, turn 26: y=3, safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 at t=27, turn 27: y=4.\n\nNow T=27, y=4: unsafe times T=24,25,32,33,34; T=27 not in, so safe.\n\nThen same as before to y=9.\n\nBut now from t=24 D, y25=2; t=25 U, y26=3; t=26 U, y27=4; then U to y28=5, etc to y31=9 at t=31, same as before, but now 8 actions? Let's see:\n\nt=24: y=3, action D, y25=2\n\nt=25: y=2, action U, y26=3\n\nt=26: y=3, action U, y27=4\n\nt=27: y=4, action U, y28=5\n\nt=28: y=5, U, y29=6\n\nt=29: y=6, U, y30=7\n\nt=30: y=7, U, y31=8\n\nt=31: y=8, need to go to y=9, so another action U at t=31, y32=9.\n\nReach at t=32, with 8 actions, worse.\n\nAfter y=2, I could go directly up faster, but to y=9 from y=2 needs 7 U, even more.\n\nSo worse than staying.\n\nWith S at start, I have 7 actions to reach at t=31.\n\nBut can I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=4 later when it is safe.\n\nBut in the direct path with wait, I reach at t=31.\n\nFrom y=3, if I go to y=4 at a time when y=4 is safe, like t=26 as above.\n\nBut the earliest I can be on y=4 safely is t=26, since at t=25 it is unsafe.\n\nt=25 unsafe, t=26 safe.\n\nThen from y=4 at t=26, I need to go to y=9, which takes 5 moves: to y=5 at t=27, y=6 t=28, y=7 t=29, y=8 t=30, y=9 t=31.\n\nSo reach at t=31.\n\nIf I start by going down, it takes longer.\n\nPerhaps I can stay on y=3 for multiple turns, but no need.\n\nAnother thing: y=4 is unsafe at T=32,33,34, but in the above, I am on y=4 at t=26, which is before 32, so fine.\n\nBut if I delay, I might hit that, but in this case, I don't.\n\nTo reach earlier, but from y=3, min to y=9 is 6 turns, but I have to avoid t=25 on y=4, so I must not be on y=4 at t=25.\n\nThe next safe time for y=4 is t=26, so I can be on y=4 at t=26.\n\nThen from there, min 5 to 9, so t=31 is earliest.\n\nt=26 y=4, t=27 y=5, t=28 y=6, t=29 y=7, t=30 y=8, t=31 y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I could be on y=5 or higher earlier, but at t=25, if I go to y=4, unsafe, so I cannot be on y=5 at t=25 directly.\n\nAt t=24, y=3; if I go U, to y=4 at t=25, but unsafe.\n\nIf I go to y=2 at t=25, then at t=25 y=2, safe, but then to go to y=5, I need to go through y=3 and y=4, which takes time.\n\nFor example, t=25 y=2, then U to y=3 at t=26, then U to y=4 at t=27, same as before.\n\nFrom y=2, I could go to y=3, etc.\n\nNo shortcut.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=5 directly? But from y=3, to y=5 in one move? No, actions only change by +1,-1,0, so must go through intermediate y.\n\nSo I think H=7 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence I have: actions from t=24 to t=30.\n\nt=24: S (stay)\n\nt=25: U (up)\n\nt=26: U\n\nt=27: U\n\nt=28: U\n\nt=29: U\n\nt=30: U\n\nWith y: t=24:3, t=25:3 (after S), t=26:4, t=27:5, t=28:6, t=29:7, t=30:8, t=31:9.\n\nAt t=31, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: 7.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be the actions.\n\nNow, but I need to confirm all are safe.\n\nTurn 24: y=3, safe as before.\n\nTurn 25: y=3, safe (y=3 unsafe only at 36-39)\n\nTurn 26: y=4, T=26, freeway 4, as above, not unsafe time, and we computed span, 0 not covered, safe.\n\nTurn 27: y=5, freeway 5, at T=27, Δt=3, span: for the car that was at [-11,0] at t=24, now at [-11+36, 0+36]? Δt=3, s=12, so [ -11 + 12*3, 12*3 ] = [ -11+36, 36] = [25,36], min=25>0, not cover 0. Other car [37,48] etc. Safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 28: y=6, similar, safe.\n\nTurn 29: y=7, safe.\n\nTurn 30: y=8, safe.\n\nThen at turn 31, y=9, reached.\n\nBut the last action is at t=30, which sets y=9 at t=31.\n\nNow, is there a way with 6 actions?\n\nSuppose I go down first to avoid.\n\nAt t=24, D to y=2 at t=25.\n\nTurn 25: y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=25, U to y=3 at t=26.\n\nTurn 26: y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=26, U to y=4 at t=27.\n\nTurn 27: y=4, T=27, safe as before.\n\nThen U to y=5 at t=28, etc., up to U at t=29 to y=6? Let's list:\n\nt=24: y=3, action D, y25=2\n\nt=25: y=2, action U, y26=3\n\nt=26: y=3, action U, y27=4\n\nt=27: y=4, action U, y28=5\n\nt=28: y=5, action U, y29=6\n\nt=29: y=6, action U, y30=7\n\nt=30: y=7, action U, y31=8\n\nNow at t=31, y=8, not 9 yet. Need another action to go to y=9 at t=32.\n\nSo 8 actions, reach at t=32, worse.\n\nAt t=25, from y=2, I could go to y=3, but same.\n\nOr, after y=2, go directly, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5-8 are safe after t=24, I could go to them quickly, but I have to go through y=4.\n\nUnless I can be on y=4 at a safe time.\n\nThe only unsafe times for y=4 are t=24,25 and t=32,33,34.\n\nt=24 and 25 are early, then safe from t=26 to t=31, then unsafe again at t=32-34.\n\nSo I can be on y=4 between t=26 and t=31 safely.\n\nSimilarly, for y=1,2,3, unsafe at t=36-39, which is later, so not immediate issue.\n\nIn the path to y=9, I don't need to stay long.\n\nSo with H=7, as first plan.\n\nBut in the first plan, I used S at start, but I could do nothing else.\n\nPerhaps I can go up at t=24 to y=4, but unsafe at t=25? At t=24, action U, so y25=4, then at turn 25, y=4, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf I go to y=4 at a different time, but earliest safe is t=26.\n\nt=26 is the earliest I can be on y=4 safely.\n\nThen from there to y=9 in 5 moves, reach at t=31.\n\nt=26 y=4, t=27 y=5, ..., t=31 y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 earlier by going through other rows, but all rows below y=4 have the same or more constraints.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=1 or y=2, but to go up, I still need to go through y=3 and y=4 eventually.\n\nAnd y=1 and y=2 have unsafe times later, but since I go early, should be fine, but it takes extra moves to go down and up.\n\nFor instance, from y=3 at t=24, go D to y=2 at t=25.\n\nThen from there, I can go U multiple times, but to reach y=9, from y=2, I need 7 U, which would be y at t=25:2, t=26:3, t=27:4, t=28:5, t=29:6, t=30:7, t=31:8, t=32:9, reach at t=32, with 8 actions.\n\nWorse than 7.\n\nIf I stay at y=3 for one extra turn, as in first plan, I save a move.\n\nSo H=7 seems minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, with S at t=24.\n\nBut let me confirm the actions.\n\nt_1 = 24.\n\nActions: for t from 24 to 30, but H is the number of turns, so actions from t=24 to t=24+H-1.\n\nWe need to list actions for t=24, t=25, ..., up to t=24+H-1.\n\nWith H=7, actions from t=24 to t=30.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 24: S\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nAfter these, at turn 31, y=9.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be like:\n\nTurn 24: S\n\nTurn 25: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 30: U\n\nBut let me write the indices.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, but in the sequence, it says {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\n\nt_1 =24, so a_{24 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: a_{24}, t=1: a_{25}, ..., t=6: a_{30} for H=7.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nWhat if I go to y=4 at t=26 directly.\n\nBut to be at y=4 at t=26, that means at turn 26 position is y=4.\n\nWhich requires that at t=25, I take action to set y=26=4.\n\nAt t=25, I am at y_{25}, take action to set y_{26}.\n\nTo have y_{26}=4, I need to be at y_{25} and take U or D or S accordingly.\n\nBut y_{25} could be 3,4,5.\n\nIf I am at y_{25}=3, take U to y_{26}=4.\n\nOr y_{25}=4, take S to y_{26}=4, or y_{25}=5, take D to y_{26}=4.\n\nBut at t=25, if I am at y=4, it is unsafe, as we saw.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=4 at t=25.\n\nTherefore, to be at y=4 at t=26, I must be at y_{25}=3 or y_{25}=5 at t=25.\n\nIf y_{25}=3, then U to y=4.\n\nIf y_{25}=5, then D to y=4.\n\nBut at t=25, y=5 is safe, since after t=24, y=5 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 safe at t=25.\n\nNow, from start, at t=24, y=3.\n\nI can go to y=5? But from y=3 to y=5 in one step? No, must go through y=4.\n\nAt t=24, action to y_{25}.\n\nIf I take U, y_{25}=4, but then at turn 25, y=4, unsafe.\n\nIf I take D, y_{25}=2.\n\nThen at t=25, y=2, safe.\n\nThen I can take U to y_{26}=3, or to y=1, etc., but not directly to y=5.\n\nTo reach y=5 at t=25, I need y_{25}=5, which requires at t=24, I take action from y=3 to set y_{25}=5, impossible, since max change +1.\n\nSo y_{25} can only be 2,3,4.\n\nBut y=4 unsafe at t=25.\n\nSo possible y_{25}=2 or 3.\n\nIf y_{25}=2, then to get to y=4 at t=26, I can go to y=3 or y=2 or y=1, but from y=2, U to y=3, or S to y=2, or D to y=1; not directly to y=4.\n\nSo from y=2 at t=25, if I take U, y_{26}=3; then at t=26, I need to take another action to y=4 at t=27? Not at t=26.\n\nAt t=26, y_{26} could be set to 4 if I take action from y_{25}.\n\nBut y_{25} is at t=25.\n\nIf at t=25, y=2, take U, set y_{26}=3.\n\nThen at t=26, y=3, I take U to set y_{27}=4.\n\nThen y=4 at t=27.\n\nBut I want y=4 at t=26, which would require that at t=25, I set y_{26}=4, so from y_{25}, if y_{25}=3, take U to y=4; or if y_{25}=4, S to y=4; or y_{25}=5, D to y=4.\n\nBut y_{25}=4 not possible without collision, y_{25}=5 impossible from start.\n\nSo only possibility is y_{25}=3 and take U to y_{26}=4.\n\nBut to have y_{25}=3, at t=24, I can take S to y_{25}=3, or D to y_{25}=2, or U to y_{25}=4 but collision.\n\nSo only S or D at t=24 to set y_{25}=3 or 2.\n\nIf S, y_{25}=3, then at t=25, take U to y_{26}=4.\n\nThen at turn 26, y=4, safe.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nIf at t=24, I take D to y_{25}=2, then at t=25, y=2, I can take U to y_{26}=3, then at t=26, y=3, take U to y_{27}=4, so y=4 at t=27, later.\n\nThen reach y=9 later.\n\nSo the fastest is to have y_{25}=3 by staying at t=24, then go to y=4 at t=26.\n\nThus H=7 is minimal.\n\nIn the sequence, all actions after that are U.\n\nNow, about the unsafe times later, like y=4 at t=32-34, but in this path, I am on y=4 at t=26, which is before, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, y=1,2,3 at t=36-39, but I am not on them at that time, since I go up early.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 24: S\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut let me write the actions.\n\nFor t from 24 to 30.\n\nIn the box.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 4, there is a car at (4,-7,right,4), which at t=24 and 25 covers 0, but in my sequence, I avoid being on y=4 at those times.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 24\\) is 7. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by waiting at \\(y = 3\\) for one turn to bypass the unsafe condition on \\(y = 4\\) at turn 25, then moving directly upward.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Justification:\n- **Turn 24 (y = 3)**: Safe, as freeway 3 (y=3) is unsafe only at turns 36-39.\n- **Turn 25 (y = 3)**: Safe, same reason as above; avoided moving to y=4 where collision occurs (freeway 4 unsafe at turns 24-25 and 32-34).\n- **Turn 26 (y = 4)**: Safe, as freeway 4 is safe at turn 26 (spans: car1 [-35,-24], car2 [1,12], car3 [37,48]; 0 not covered).\n- **Turn 27 (y = 5)**: Safe, as freeway 5 is safe after turn 24 (spans: car1 [25,36], car2 [37,48]; 0 not covered).\n- **Turn 28 (y = 6)**: Safe, similar to y=5 (freeway 6 safe after turn 24).\n- **Turn 29 (y = 7)**: Safe, similar to y=5 (freeway 7 safe after turn 24).\n- **Turn 30 (y = 8)**: Safe, similar to y=5 (freeway 8 safe after turn 24).\n\nAfter the last action at turn 30, the player reaches (0,9) at turn 31, which is safe.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions are taken from turn \\(t_1 = 24\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 24 + 6 = 30\\), with \\(H = 7\\).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: S \\\\\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: U \\\\\nTurn 28: U \\\\\nTurn 29: U \\\\\nTurn 30: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I'm given its position at turn t₁=26. The car spans are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). I need to find where these cars are at future turns to avoid being on the same freeway when the car covers x=0.\n\nCollision happens at turn T only if the player is on freeway y at turn T and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn T. Importantly, when I move from y to y+1 or y-1, at turn T, I'm only on y_T, not on the new row until turn T+1. So if I move, I don't care about the row I'm moving to at that turn, only about my current row.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is the top row, and since there are no cars on y=0 or y=9, I only need to worry about rows 1 to 8.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so once I'm there, I'm safe. Similarly, y=0 has no cars, but I start at y=4.\n\nNow, t₁=26, and I need to find actions from t=26 onwards for H turns, ending at y=9.\n\nFirst, I should figure out for each freeway and for each future turn, whether x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nLet me list all the cars and their movements.\n\nAll cars are moving right, according to the table. Direction is \"right\" for all, so they are all moving to the right, meaning increasing x.\n\nFor right-moving cars, span at time t is [τ + s(t - t₁), h + s(t - t₁)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)]\n\nBut in the initial state, at t₁, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, head is the front, so at t₁, span is [tail, head] or [head, tail]? The notation says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, it says \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h]\" because it says for right-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] and Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nIn the table, for example, freeway 4: (-24, -35, right, 4), but -35 and -24, with -35 < -24, so tail is -35, head is -24, so at t₁, span is [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? But that would be from left to right, with tail left, head right.\n\nSimilarly, for (12, 1, right, 4), 1 to 12, so tail=1, head=12? 1 < 12, so tail=1, head=12.\n\nBut in the car state, it's written as (head, tail), so for (-24, -35, right, 4), head=-24, tail=-35, so since tail < head, and direction right, span is [tail, head] = [-35, -24].\n\nSimilarly, for (12, 1, right, 4), head=12, tail=1, span [1,12].\n\nAnother one: (48,37,right,4), head=48, tail=37, span [37,48].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow for freeway 5: (24,13,right,12), head=24, tail=13, span [13,24] at t₁.\n\nAnd (-48,-59,right,12), head=-48, tail=-59, span [-59,-48].\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3 have only one car each: (-30,-41,right,3), so head=-30, tail=-41, span [-41,-30] at t₁, speed 3.\n\nNow, for a car, at time T, span is [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)] for right-moving.\n\nSince both tail and head move by s per turn.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right-moving here.\n\nSo collision on freeway k at turn T if player is on y=k at turn T and there exists a car on freeway k such that 0 is in [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)].\n\nSince the span is continuous, 0 is covered if τ + s(T - t₁) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T - t₁) for that car.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when x=0 is covered by any car on that freeway.\n\nLet Δt = T - t₁, so time since turn 26.\n\nFor each freeway, let's list the cars and find for which Δt, 0 is in the span.\n\nStart with freeway 1: only one car, h=-30, τ=-41, s=3, direction right.\n\nSpan at T: [ -41 + 3Δt, -30 + 3Δt ]\n\n0 is in this if -41 + 3Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -30 + 3Δt\n\nSo -41 + 3Δt ≤ 0 => 3Δt ≤ 41 => Δt ≤ 41/3 ≈ 13.666, so Δt ≤ 13 since integer? Δt is integer, turns are discrete.\n\nT and t₁ are integers, so Δt integer.\n\n-41 + 3Δt ≤ 0 => 3Δt ≤ 41 => Δt ≤ 13.666, so Δt ≤ 13\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -30 + 3Δt => 30 ≤ 3Δt => Δt ≥ 10\n\nSo for Δt from 10 to 13 inclusive, the car covers x=0.\n\nΔt=10: -41 + 30 = -11, -30 + 30 = 0, so [ -11, 0 ], 0 is included.\n\nΔt=11: -41+33= -8, -30+33=3, [ -8,3], 0 in\n\nΔt=12: -41+36= -5, -30+36=6, [ -5,6], 0 in\n\nΔt=13: -41+39= -2, -30+39=9, [ -2,9], 0 in\n\nΔt=14: -41+42=1, -30+42=12, [1,12], 0 not <=1? 1>0, so [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=9: -41+27= -14, -30+27= -3, [ -14,-3], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 1 dangerous at Δt=10,11,12,13.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (-30,-41,right,3), so same, dangerous at Δt=10,11,12,13.\n\nFreeway 3: same, also dangerous at Δt=10,11,12,13.\n\nNow freeway 4: multiple cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,4), head=-24, tail=-35, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [ -35 + 4Δt, -24 + 4Δt ]\n\n0 in: -35 + 4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 4Δt\n\n-35 + 4Δt ≤ 0 => 4Δt ≤ 35 => Δt ≤ 35/4 = 8.75, so Δt ≤ 8\n\n0 ≤ -24 + 4Δt => 24 ≤ 4Δt => Δt ≥ 6\n\nSo Δt from 6 to 8 inclusive.\n\nΔt=6: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, [ -11,0], 0 in\n\nΔt=7: -35+28= -7, -24+28=4, [ -7,4], 0 in\n\nΔt=8: -35+32= -3, -24+32=8, [ -3,8], 0 in\n\nΔt=9: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSecond car on freeway 4: (12,1,right,4), head=12, tail=1, s=4\n\nSpan: [1 + 4Δt, 12 + 4Δt]\n\n0 in: 1 + 4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 12 + 4Δt\n\nBut 1 + 4Δt ≤ 0? Since 1 + 4Δt ≥1 >0 for Δt≥0, so never ≤0, so 0 cannot be ≤ lower bound since lower bound at least 1. So this car never covers x=0.\n\nThird car: (48,37,right,4), head=48, tail=37, s=4\n\nSpan: [37 + 4Δt, 48 + 4Δt], all positive and increasing, so for Δt≥0, min is 37>0, so never covers x=0.\n\nSo for freeway 4, only first car matters, dangerous at Δt=6,7,8.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,12), head=24, tail=13, s=12\n\nSpan: [13 + 12Δt, 24 + 12Δt], all positive, min 13>0, so never covers x=0.\n\nSecond car: (-48,-59,right,12), head=-48, tail=-59, s=12\n\nSpan: [ -59 + 12Δt, -48 + 12Δt ]\n\n0 in: -59 + 12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 12Δt\n\nLeft: -59 + 12Δt ≤ 0 => 12Δt ≤ 59 => Δt ≤ 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so Δt ≤ 4\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -48 + 12Δt => 48 ≤ 12Δt => Δt ≥ 4\n\nSo Δt=4 only? Δt=4: -59 + 48 = -11, -48 + 48 = 0, [ -11, 0], 0 in\n\nΔt=5: -59 + 60 =1, -48 + 60=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nΔt=3: -59 + 36= -23, -48 + 36= -12, [ -23,-12], 0 not in\n\nSo only Δt=4 dangerous from this car.\n\nFirst car doesn't cover, so freeway 5 dangerous only at Δt=4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as freeway 5? Cars are (24,13,right,12) and (-48,-59,right,12), same as above.\n\nSo dangerous at Δt=4 only.\n\nFreeway 7: same, dangerous at Δt=4 only.\n\nFreeway 8: same, dangerous at Δt=4 only.\n\nNow, freeway 4 we have dangerous at Δt=6,7,8.\n\nFreeways 1,2,3 dangerous at Δt=10,11,12,13.\n\nI need to get from y=4 to y=9, which is 5 steps up, but I can move up, down, or stay, so it might take more turns if I need to avoid being on certain rows at certain times.\n\ny=4 to y=9, difference is 5, so minimum H=5 if I go up every turn, but I might collide or need to detour.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=26 to t=26+H-1, so after H actions, at turn t=26+H, position should be y=9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions at times t₁, t₁+1, ..., t₁+H-1.\n\nAfter action at t, position at t+1.\n\nStart at turn t₁=26, position (0, y_{26}) = (0,4)\n\nAfter action a_{26}, at turn 27, position y_{27} = y_{26} + Δy based on a_{26}\n\nSimilarly, after a_{27}, at turn 28, y_{28}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t₁ + H, position is y_{t₁ + H}\n\nWe want y_{t₁ + H} = 9, since we reach at turn t₁ + H.\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9) at turn t₁ + H - 1\"? Let's read.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1, meaning actions at times t₁ + t for t=0 to H-1, so times t₁ to t₁ + H - 1.\n\nAfter action at time t, position at time t+1.\n\nSo after action at t₁ + H - 1, position at (t₁ + H - 1) + 1 = t₁ + H.\n\nBut we want y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9? Let's parse the indices.\n\nAt time t, before action, position is (0, y_t)\n\nThen we take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nThen at time t+1, we are at (0, y_{t+1})\n\nCollision is checked at each turn when we are on a freeway.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at some turn, meaning y_T = 9 for some T.\n\nThe sequence ends when y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9, but y_{t₁ + H - 1} is the position after actions up to a_{t₁ + H - 2}, I think.\n\nSet t = t₁ = 26.\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nAt time t+1, position y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at time t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, at time t+1, position y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for times from t to t+H-1, so actions: a_t, a_{t+1}, ..., a_{t+H-1}\n\nAfter a_t, at time t+1, y_{t+1}\n\nAfter a_{t+1}, at time t+2, y_{t+2}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t+H-1}, at time t+H, y_{t+H}\n\nWe want y_{t+H} = 9? But the condition is y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9.\n\nt₁ + H - 1 is the time of the last action.\n\nAfter last action a_{t₁ + H - 1}, position at time (t₁ + H - 1) + 1 = t₁ + H.\n\nBut we want the position at time t₁ + H - 1 to be 9? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think there's confusion in the indexing.\n\nRead carefully:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so for t=0, a_{t₁ + 0} = a_{t₁}, action at time t₁\n\nt=1, a_{t₁+1}, ..., t=H-1, a_{t₁ + H -1}\n\nThe position after these actions: after a_{t₁} at time t₁+1, y_{t₁+1}\n\nAfter a_{t₁ + H -1} at time t₁ + H, y_{t₁ + H}\n\nBut we want to reach (0,9), so y_{t₁ + H} = 9? But the task says \"such that y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9\"\n\n\"y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t₁ + H - 1} is the position at time t₁ + H - 1.\n\nAt time t₁ + H - 1, we are at y_{t₁ + H - 1}, and we take action a_{t₁ + H - 1}, which changes to y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9, meaning that at time t₁ + H - 1, we are already at (0,9), and we take an action, but since we are at 9, if we go up, we stay at 9 because y=9 is boundary, or we can stay or down, but the point is to be at 9.\n\nBut at time t₁ + H - 1, we are at y_{t₁ + H - 1} =9, so we have reached at that turn.\n\nThen the action a_{t₁ + H - 1} might be taken, but it doesn't change position if we stay or go down, but since we are at 9, going up does nothing.\n\nBut the sequence includes actions up to a_{t₁ + H -1}, and at the start of turn t₁ + H -1, we are at y_{t₁ + H -1}, and after action, we are at y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nBut since we want y_{t₁ + H -1} =9, that means at the beginning of turn t₁ + H -1, we are at 9, so we don't need to move, but we still take an action? It's a bit messy.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that the position is updated after the action, so we reach the position at the end of the turn.\n\nBut let's see the collision: collision occurs at turn T if we are on y_T and a car covers 0 at T.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T.\n\nFor the reaching, when we are at y_T=9, we have reached.\n\nIn the sequence, for H turns of actions, we start at time t₁, position y_{t₁}, take a_{t₁}, go to y_{t₁+1} at time t₁+1, ..., take a_{t₁+H-1}, go to y_{t₁+H} at time t₁+H.\n\nBut we want y_{t₁ + H -1} =9, which is the position at time t₁ + H -1.\n\nAt time t₁ + H -1, we are at y_{t₁ + H -1}, and we take action a_{t₁ + H -1} to go to y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nIf y_{t₁ + H -1} =9, then we have reached at time t₁ + H -1, and the action at t₁ + H -1 might be to stay or something, but it's not necessary for reaching, but the sequence includes it.\n\nSince we are at 9, any action keeps us at 9 or moves to 8, but we should stay or up to remain, but to minimize H, we want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nI think the key is that at time t₁ + H -1, we must be at y=9.\n\nSo for that, the actions from t₁ to t₁ + H -2 determine y_{t₁ + H -1}, and at that time we are at 9.\n\nThe action at t₁ + H -1 is taken, but it doesn't affect the reaching, since we are already there.\n\nFor collision, at time t₁ + H -1, if we are at y=9, no car, so safe.\n\nBut during the path, we need to avoid collision.\n\nBack to the problem.\n\nStart at t=26, y=4.\n\nWe need to get to y=9 at some turn T, with T = t₁ + H -1.\n\nLet T_reach = t₁ + H -1, and y_{T_reach} =9.\n\nT_reach = 26 + H -1.\n\nWe need to find minimal H such that we can go from y=4 at t=26 to y=9 at t=26 + H -1, in H-1 actions? Let's define the time.\n\nSet t_start = 26, y_start =4.\n\nAt time t, for t from t_start to some t_end, with y_{t_end} =9.\n\nThe number of actions to go from t to t_end is (t_end - t_start) actions.\n\nFrom time t_start to t_end, there are (t_end - t_start) actions: actions at t_start, t_start+1, ..., t_end-1.\n\nAfter action at t_end-1, at time t_end, y_{t_end}=9.\n\nSo the sequence of actions has length K = t_end - t_start.\n\nThen H = K, the number of actions, and t_end = t_start + H.\n\nBut we want y_{t_start + H -1} =9.\n\nt_end = t_start + H -1? Let's see.\n\nIf we have H actions, at times t_start to t_start + H -1.\n\nAfter these, at time t_start + H, position y_{t_start + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_start + H -1} =9.\n\nSo at time t_start + H -1, we are at y=9.\n\nTo reach there, we need to have moved from y=4 to y=9 in the actions from t_start to t_start + H -2, I think.\n\nActions:\n\n- At time t_start, take a_{t_start}, go to y_{t_start+1} at time t_start+1\n\n- At time t_start+1, take a_{t_start+1}, go to y_{t_start+2} at time t_start+2\n\n- ...\n- At time t_start + H -2, take a_{t_start + H -2}, go to y_{t_start + H -1} at time t_start + H -1\n\n- At time t_start + H -1, take a_{t_start + H -1}, go to y_{t_start + H} at time t_start + H\n\nWe want y_{t_start + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for the position at time t_start + H -1 to be 9, it is determined by the actions up to a_{t_start + H -2}.\n\nThe action a_{t_start + H -1} is taken when we are already at 9, so it doesn't affect the reaching, but it is part of the sequence for H turns.\n\nSince we are at 9, we can choose S or U (which does nothing) or D to go to 8, but to stay at 9, we should choose S or U.\n\nBut for the purpose, we can choose S.\n\nNow, the minimal H means minimal number of actions to achieve y_{t_start + H -1} =9.\n\nSince we start at y=4 at t=26, and want to be at y=9 at some T, with T = 26 + H -1.\n\nThe number of steps to increase y by 5, but we can move vertically, so the minimum number of actions needed is 5 if we go up each time, but we might need to wait or detour to avoid collisions.\n\nThe net displacement must be +5, but we can go down or stay, so the actual number of moves might be more than 5.\n\nH is the number of actions, so for net +5, H >=5.\n\nIf we go up every time, H=5, we reach at time 26+5 =31, but y at time T.\n\nAt t=26, y=4\n\nAfter a26, at t=27, y=5 if U\n\nAfter a27, at t=28, y=6 if U\n\nAfter a28, at t=29, y=7 if U\n\nAfter a29, at t=30, y=8 if U\n\nAfter a30, at t=31, y=9 if U\n\nSo at time t=31, y=9.\n\nBut we want y_T =9 for T= t_start + H -1.\n\nIn this case, with H=5 actions at t=26,27,28,29,30, we have y at t=27,28,29,30,31.\n\ny at time t_start + H -1 = 26 +5 -1 =30, which is y=8, not 9.\n\nProblem: we want y_{t_start + H -1} =9.\n\nWith H actions, the position at time t_start + H -1 is after H-1 actions.\n\nStart: at t=26, y=4\n\nAfter 1 action (a26), at t=27, y= something\n\nAfter 2 actions, at t=28, y\n\n...\nAfter k actions, at t=26+k, y\n\nWe want at time T = t_start + H -1, y_T =9.\n\nT = 26 + H -1\n\nAt time T, we have taken (T - 26) actions.\n\nSince we start at t=26, before any action.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=26, y=4\n\nAfter 1 action, at t=27, y\n\nAfter 2 actions, at t=28, y\n\n...\nAfter m actions, at t=26+m, y\n\nSet T = 26 + H -1\n\nAt time T, we have taken (T - 26) actions.\n\nBut T = 26 + H -1, so T - 26 = H -1, so after H-1 actions, we are at time T with y_T=9.\n\nThen the sequence of actions is for the first H-1 actions to reach y_T=9, and the H-th action is at time T, but since we are at 9, we take some action.\n\nThe sequence has H actions: from a_{t_start} to a_{t_start + H -1}\n\nAt time t_start + H -1, we are at y_{t_start + H -1} =9.\n\nBefore taking action at that time, we are at 9.\n\nThen we take action a_{t_start + H -1}, which changes to y_{t_start + H}, but we don't care about that for reaching.\n\nFor collision, at time t_start + H -1, we are at y=9, no car, so safe.\n\nTo achieve y_{t_start + H -1} =9, we need to move from y=4 at t=26 to y=9 at t=26 + H -1.\n\nThe time difference is (26 + H -1) - 26 = H -1 turns, so we have H-1 actions to change position from 4 to 9, net +5.\n\nEach action can change y by -1,0,+1, so net change depends on the number of U, D, S.\n\nLet U be number of up, D down, S stay, with U + D + S = H-1 actions, and net Δy = U - D = 5, since from 4 to 9.\n\nThen U = D + 5, and U + D + S = H-1, so (D+5) + D + S = H-1, so 2D + S +5 = H-1, so H-1 = 2D + S +5\n\nSince D >=0, S>=0, H-1 >=5, so H >=6.\n\nMinimum H-1=5 when D=0,S=0,U=5, but H-1=5, H=6.\n\nWith H-1=5 actions, we can go from y=4 to y=9 in 5 steps if all U.\n\nBut with 5 actions, we reach at time 26+5=31 with y=9.\n\nBut we want y at time t_start + H -1.\n\nIf H=6, t_start + H -1 = 26 +6 -1=31, so we want y at time 31 to be 9.\n\nWith H=6 actions, we have 5 actions to move, and the 6th action at time 31 when we are at 9.\n\nSimilarly, for H=5, t_start + H -1=26+5-1=30, we want y at time 30 to be 9.\n\nBut with 4 actions from t=26 to 29, we can go to y=9 at t=30 if we move up 4 times? From t=26 y=4, after a26 at t=27 y=5, after a27 at t=28 y=6, after a28 at t=29 y=7, after a29 at t=30 y=8, so to have y at t=30=9, we need to be at 9 at t=30, which requires that at t=29 we were at 8 or 9, and moved up or stayed.\n\nWith fewer actions, it's harder to reach higher y.\n\nLet's list the time and possible y.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for T = 26 + H -1.\n\nFor a given H, T=26+H-1.\n\nWe start at t=26, y=4.\n\nAt time t, y_t.\n\nAfter action at t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nThe position at time T must be 9.\n\nThe number of actions from t=26 to t=T-1 determines y_T.\n\nActions at times 26 to T-1, each action affects the position at the next time.\n\nAfter actions at 26 to T-1, position at T.\n\nNumber of actions: from 26 to T-1 inclusive, that's (T-1) - 26 +1 = T - 26 actions.\n\nThen for position at T to be 9, with initial y26=4, net change +5 in T-26 actions.\n\nU - D =5, U + D + S = T - 26.\n\nS is number of stay, which doesn't change position.\n\nThen U = D +5, so (D+5) + D + S = T - 26, so 2D + S +5 = T - 26.\n\nBut T = 26 + H -1, so T - 26 = H -1.\n\nSo 2D + S +5 = H -1.\n\nSince D and S >=0, H-1 >=5, H>=6.\n\nFor H=6, H-1=5, so 2D + S +5 =5, so 2D + S=0, so D=0,S=0,U=5.\n\nSo with H=6, we must have exactly 5 up actions in the first 5 actions, reaching y=9 at time 31, and the 6th action at time 31 can be S or U.\n\nSimilarly, for H=7, H-1=6, 2D+S+5=6, so 2D+S=1, so either D=0,S=1 or D=0.5,S=0 but D integer, so D=0,S=1,U=5 or D=1,S=0,U=6, etc.\n\nBut since we want minimal H, we should try H=6 first.\n\nWith H=6, we need to go from y=4 at t=26 to y=9 at t=31, with actions at t=26,27,28,29,30 all U, so that at t=27 y=5, t=28 y=6, t=29 y=7, t=30 y=8, t=31 y=9.\n\nThen at time t=31, y=9, which is t_start + H -1 =26+6-1=31, good.\n\nAnd we need to take action at t=31, a31, which can be S, for example.\n\nNow, we need to check for collision during the path, from t=26 to t=31.\n\nAt each turn, when we are on a freeway y=1 to 8, we must not have a car covering x=0 at that time.\n\nNow, y_t for t=26 to 31:\n\nt=26: y=4\n\nt=27: y=5 (after a26=U)\n\nt=28: y=6 (after a27=U)\n\nt=29: y=7 (after a28=U)\n\nt=30: y=8 (after a29=U)\n\nt=31: y=9 (after a30=U), at t=31, y=9, no car, safe.\n\nNow, collision check at t=26,27,28,29,30.\n\ny=4 at t=26, y=5 at t=27, etc.\n\nFreeway y=4 at t=26.\n\nt=26 is t_start, Δt=0.\n\nFor freeway 4, dangerous at Δt=6,7,8.\n\nΔt= T - t₁ = T - 26.\n\nAt t=26, Δt=0, not 6,7,8, so safe for y=4.\n\nFreeway 4 dangerous at Δt=6,7,8, which is t=32,33,34, but we are at t=26, Δt=0, not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nAt t=26, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nCars on freeway 4: at Δt=0, we have the spans.\n\nFirst car: [ -35, -24], 0 not in, since -24<0? -24 is negative, so 0 not in [-35,-24], -24<0.\n\nSecond car [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nThird [37,48], not.\n\nSo at t=26, freeway 4 safe.\n\nNow t=27, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nΔt= t-26 =1\n\nFreeway 5 dangerous at Δt=4 only.\n\nΔt=1, not 4, so safe.\n\nCheck cars: at Δt=1, freeway 5 cars.\n\nFirst car (24,13,right,12): span [13 +12*1, 24+12*1] = [25,36], not cover 0.\n\nSecond car (-48,-59,right,12): span [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nt=28, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nΔt=2\n\nFreeway 6 dangerous at Δt=4 only.\n\nNot 4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, cars: similar to freeway 5, at Δt=2, [13+24,24+24]=[37,48] and [-59+24,-48+24]=[-35,-24], both not cover 0.\n\nt=29, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nΔt=3\n\nDangerous at Δt=4 only, not yet.\n\nCars: [13+36,24+36]=[49,60], [-59+36,-48+36]=[-23,-12], no 0.\n\nt=30, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nΔt=4\n\nNow freeway 8 dangerous at Δt=4.\n\nFor freeway 8, at Δt=4, the second car covers x=0.\n\nFreeway 8 has cars (24,13,right,12) and (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nAt Δt=4, first car span [13+48,24+48]=[61,72], no\n\nSecond car span [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], so [ -11, 0], which includes 0.\n\nSo at t=30, Δt=4, on freeway 8, the car covers x=0, so collision if we are there.\n\nAt t=30, we are at y=8, freeway 8, and car covers 0, so collision.\n\nTherefore, cannot be on y=8 at t=30.\n\nIn the direct path, at t=30, y=8, collision.\n\nSo we need to avoid this.\n\nThus, with all up, we collide at t=30 on y=8.\n\nTherefore, we cannot use H=6 with all up; we need to adjust the path or use more turns.\n\nNow, for H=6, we must have all up to reach y=9 at t=31, but we have to be at y=8 at t=30, which is dangerous.\n\nWe could arrive at y=9 earlier or later.\n\nWith H=6, we must be at y=9 at t=31, so at t=30, we must be at y=8 or y=9.\n\nIf at t=30 we are at y=9, then at t=31 we are at y=9 or 8, but we need y at t=31 to be 9? No.\n\nFor H=6, we need y at t=31 to be 9.\n\nt=31 is t_start + H -1 =26+6-1=31.\n\nAt time t=31, y=9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at t=31, at time t=30, we must have been at y=8 or y=9, and taken action U or S to be at y=9 at t=31.\n\nIf at t=30, y=8, then a30=U to y=9 at t=31.\n\nIf at t=30, y=9, then a30=S or U to stay at 9 at t=31.\n\nBut in the collision at t=30 on y=8, if we are at y=8 at t=30, we collide.\n\nTo avoid, we could be at y=9 at t=30, so we don't need to be on y=8 at t=30.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=30, we need to arrive earlier.\n\nFor smaller H.\n\nFirst, minimal H.\n\nH=6 requires y at t=31=9.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=31, we must have been at y=8 or 9 at t=30.\n\nIf at t=30 we are at y=9, then we are safe at t=30 since y=9 no car.\n\nThen at t=31, we are still at 9.\n\nBut for H=6, we need y at t=31=9, which is fine.\n\nNow, to be at y=9 at t=30, that would require fewer actions.\n\nLet's find the earliest possible time to reach y=9.\n\nStart at t=26, y=4.\n\nWith all up: a26=U, t=27 y=5; a27=U, t=28 y=6; a28=U, t=29 y=7; a29=U, t=30 y=8; a30=U, t=31 y=9.\n\nSo earliest at t=31.\n\nCan we reach earlier? For example, if we start with U at t=26, t=27 y=5; but we can't go faster, since only +1 per turn.\n\nUnless we are already higher, but we start at 4.\n\nSo minimum time to reach y=9 is t=31 with 5 up actions.\n\nBut at t=30, y=8 is dangerous for that time.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at t=31, but avoid being on dangerous positions.\n\nWith H=6, we need to be at y=9 at t=31.\n\nAt t=30, we must be at y=8 or y=9.\n\nIf we can be at y=9 at t=30, then we don't need to be on y=8 at t=30.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=30, we need to have reached by t=30.\n\nAt t=30, y=9.\n\nThat requires actions from t=26 to t=29.\n\nAt t=26, y=4; after a26, t=27 y; ... after a29, t=30 y.\n\nTo have y at t=30=9, we need net +5 in 4 actions (from t=26 to t=29).\n\nU - D =5, U + D + S =4, so U = D +5, (D+5) + D + S =4, 2D + S = -1, impossible.\n\nThus, cannot reach y=9 by t=30.\n\nSimilarly, earliest at t=31.\n\nSo must be at t=31 at y=9.\n\nAt t=30, we must be at y=8 to go to y=9 with U, or at y=9 with S, but if at y=9 at t=30, then at t=31 y=9 with S.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=30, same issue, impossible.\n\nSince we start at y=4, after k actions, y <= 4+k, so at t=26+k, y <=4+k.\n\nSet equal to 9 at t=31, 26+5=31, y<=4+5=9, possible only with all U.\n\nAt t=30, y<=4+4=8, so y=8 at t=30 if all first 4 actions U.\n\nThus, for any path to be at y=9 at t=31, we must be at y=8 at t=30, because from t=26 to t=30 is 4 turns, y from 4 to at most 8, so exactly 8 if we went up 4 times.\n\nThen at t=30, y=8, and we take U to y=9 at t=31.\n\nBut at t=30, y=8, which is dangerous as we saw.\n\nTherefore, for H=6, it is impossible to reach without collision, because we must be on y=8 at t=30 when it is dangerous.\n\nNow, what about being at y=9 at t=31 with different path? But to be at y=8 at t=30, we need to be there, and it's collided.\n\nUnless we can be at y=8 at a different time when it's safe, but at t=30 it is dangerous, and for H=6, t=30 is fixed for that position.\n\nFor H=6, the time t=30 must have y=8, but at that time, freeway 8 is dangerous.\n\nSo impossible for H=6.\n\nThus minimal H must be larger.\n\nNow try H=7.\n\nWith H=7, we want y at t=26+7-1=32 to be 9.\n\nT=32.\n\nSo y at time 32 must be 9.\n\nNow, from t=26 to t=32, there are 6 actions: at t=26 to t=31.\n\nAfter 6 actions, at t=32, y=9.\n\nNet change +5 in 6 actions.\n\nU - D =5, U + D + S =6.\n\nSo U = D +5, then (D+5) + D + S =6, 2D + S +5=6, so 2D + S =1.\n\nSince D and S integers, possible: D=0, S=1, U=5; or D=1, S=0, U=6? U= D+5=6, but U + D + S=6+1+0=7>6? U + D + S = number of actions=6.\n\nU = D +5\n\nU + D + S =6\n\nSo (D+5) + D + S =6, 2D + S +5=6, 2D + S=1.\n\nSo D=0, S=1, U=5; or D=1, S=0, U=6? U= D+5=1+5=6, then U+D+S=6+1+0=7, but should be 6, contradiction.\n\n2D + S=1, with D and S non-negative integers.\n\nIf D=0, S=1, then U=5, U+D+S=5+0+1=6, good.\n\nIf D=1, S=0, U=6, U+D+S=6+1+0=7>6, not possible.\n\nIf D=0, S=1, U=5.\n\nOr D=1, S=-1, impossible.\n\nSo only possibility: D=0, S=1, U=5.\n\nWe must have exactly 5 up, 1 stay, and 0 down.\n\nThe stay can be at any time.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at t=32.\n\nAt t=32, y=9.\n\nAt t=32, Δt = T - t₁ = 32-26=6.\n\nNow, we need to check the path from t=26 to t=32.\n\ny at each time.\n\nWe start at t=26, y=4.\n\nAfter actions, we have 6 actions: 5 U and 1 S.\n\nThe position at time t depends on when we take the actions.\n\nSince we have one stay, we can delay some move to avoid being on dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nFirst, list dangerous times for each row.\n\nFreeway dangerous times:\n\nFrom earlier:\n\ny=1: dangerous at Δt=10,11,12,13 → t=36,37,38,39\n\ny=2: same, t=36,37,38,39\n\ny=3: same, t=36,37,38,39\n\ny=4: dangerous at Δt=6,7,8 → t=32,33,34\n\ny=5: dangerous at Δt=4 → t=30\n\ny=6: dangerous at Δt=4 → t=30\n\ny=7: dangerous at Δt=4 → t=30\n\ny=8: dangerous at Δt=4 → t=30\n\ny=5,6,7,8 all dangerous only at t=30, Δt=4.\n\ny=4 dangerous at t=32,33,34.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at t=32.\n\nNow, at t=32, y=9, safe.\n\nBut we need to avoid collision at previous times.\n\nSince we have one stay, we can stay at some safe row to avoid moving to a dangerous position at the wrong time.\n\nNow, we must go through the rows.\n\nThe path: from y=4 at t=26 to y=9 at t=32.\n\nIn 6 actions, but net +5, with one stay.\n\nSo the y values over time.\n\nLet me denote the position at time t.\n\nt=26: y=4\n\nt=27: after a26, y= y26 + Δy\n\n...\n\nt=32: y=9\n\nSince U=5, S=1, D=0, we will be at y=4 for one turn (if stay at beginning), or higher.\n\nThe position increases by 1 most of the time, but stays once.\n\nFor example, if we stay at t=26, then y=4 at t=27, same as t=26, then move up, etc.\n\nBut we need to be at y=9 at t=32.\n\nThe minimal y at t=32 is if we stay early, but we need exactly y=9 at t=32.\n\nSince we start at 4, and must end at 9, with 5 up and one stay, in 6 steps.\n\nThe time from t=26 to t=32 is 7 positions: t=26,27,28,29,30,31,32.\n\ny at these times.\n\nAt t=26: 4\n\nAt t=32: 9\n\nDifference +5 over 6 intervals (actions).\n\nWith one stay, so y increases by 0 at one step, and +1 at five steps.\n\nThe values: let s be the time when we stay, so at that action, y_{t+1} = y_t.\n\nOtherwise, y_{t+1} = y_t +1 for up.\n\nSince D=0, no down.\n\nNow, at t=32, y=9.\n\nWe need to ensure that at each t from 26 to 31, when on y=1 to 8, no collision.\n\nNow, dangerous times:\n\nt=30: y=5,6,7,8 all dangerous. Only y=1,2,3,4,9 safe? But y=4 at t=30: Δt=4, freeway 4 dangerous at Δt=6,7,8, not 4. Δt=4, t=30, for y=4.\n\nFreeway 4 dangerous at Δt=6,7,8 → t=32,33,34, not t=30.\n\nAt t=30, Δt=4.\n\nFreeway 1: dangerous at Δt=10,11,12,13, not 4\n\nFreeway 2: same\n\nFreeway 3: same\n\nFreeway 4: dangerous at Δt=6,7,8, not 4\n\nFreeway 5: dangerous at Δt=4, yes\n\nFreeway 6: at Δt=4\n\nFreeway 7: at Δt=4\n\nFreeway 8: at Δt=4\n\nSo at t=30, freeways 5,6,7,8 are dangerous; freeways 1,2,3,4 are safe.\n\ny=1,2,3,4 safe at t=30.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 dangerous at t=30.\n\nSimilarly, at other times.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at t=32.\n\nt=32 is also dangerous for y=4, but y=4 at t=32? We are at y=9 at t=32, so not on y=4.\n\nBut let's list for each time what rows are dangerous.\n\nFor a given time t, Δt=t-26.\n\nThen:\n\n- If Δt=4, t=30, dangerous rows: y=5,6,7,8\n\n- If Δt=6, t=32, dangerous rows: y=4 (since freeway 4 dangerous at Δt=6)\n\n- If Δt=7, t=33, dangerous y=4\n\n- If Δt=8, t=34, dangerous y=4\n\n- If Δt=10,11,12,13, dangerous y=1,2,3, but later times.\n\nSince we are only concerned up to t=32 for now, with H=7.\n\nt from 26 to 32.\n\nAt t=26: Δt=0, no dangerous rows? Let's see.\n\nΔt=0: t=26\n\nFreeway 1: not dangerous, Δt=0<10\n\nSimilarly all, only freeway 4 dangerous from Δt=6,7,8, not 0.\n\nCars: for example y=4 at t=26, as before, no car at 0.\n\nSimilarly, all rows safe at t=26.\n\nt=27: Δt=1\n\nNo dangerous rows, since min dangerous Δt=4 for y=5-8, or 6 for y=4.\n\nt=28: Δt=2, safe\n\nt=29: Δt=3, safe\n\nt=30: Δt=4, dangerous for y=5,6,7,8\n\nt=31: Δt=5\n\nNow Δt=5, what dangerous?\n\ny=1: dangerous at Δt=10-13, not\n\ny=2: same\n\ny=3: same\n\ny=4: dangerous at Δt=6,7,8, not 5\n\ny=5: dangerous only at Δt=4, not 5\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8 only at Δt=4\n\nSo at Δt=5, t=31, all rows safe? Freeway 4 at Δt=5: span [ -35+4*5, -24+4*5] = [-35+20, -24+20] = [-15,-4], no 0\n\nOther cars on y=4 not cover.\n\ny=5: at Δt=5, freeway 5 cars: [13+60,24+60]? First car [13+12*5,24+12*5]=[13+60,24+60]=[73,84], no; second car [-59+60, -48+60]=[1,12], 0 not in, since 1>0.\n\nSimilarly for others, so yes, at t=31, Δt=5, no dangerous rows.\n\nt=32: Δt=6, dangerous for y=4.\n\nBut we want to be at y=9 at t=32, safe.\n\nNow, for the path:\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=5,6,7,8 at t=30.\n\nAt t=30, we must not be on rows 5-8.\n\nPossible safe rows at t=30: y=0,1,2,3,4,9\n\nBut y=0 or 9 might be possible, but y=9 at t=30 is impossible as we saw earlier.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 at t=30, but we start from 4, going up, so y>=4, probably not 0.\n\nSince we have one stay, we can be at y=4 at t=30, for example.\n\ny=4 at t=30 is safe, as above.\n\nOr y=3, but we start from 4, to go to 9, with no down, so y only increases or stays, so y at t=30 can be from 4 to 8, but since we avoid 5-8, only possible y=4 at t=30.\n\ny=4 at t=30 is safe.\n\nThen from there, we go to y=9 at t=32.\n\nNow, with actions.\n\nWe need to reach y=4 at t=30.\n\nThen from t=30 to t=32, we need to go to y=9.\n\nIn two actions: from y=4 at t=30, to y=9 at t=32.\n\nt=32 y=9.\n\nAfter actions at t=30 and t=31.\n\nAt t=30, we are at y=4.\n\nTake action a30, to y at t=31.\n\nThen a31 to y at t=32=9.\n\nTo go from y=4 to y=9 in two actions, we need two up, so y at t=31=5 or 6? If a30=U, y31=5; then a31=U, y32=6, not 9.\n\nImpossible to reach y=9 from y=4 in two actions; max y=6.\n\nBut we need y=9 at t=32.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=30, after two actions, at t=32, y <= 4+2=6 <9, impossible.\n\nContradiction.\n\nWe need to be at higher y earlier.\n\nSince we have to be at y=9 at t=32, and at t=30 we need to be at a safe y, which for t=30 is y=4.\n\nBut from y=4 at t=30 to y=9 at t=32 is impossible in two steps.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=4 at t=30.\n\nBut at t=30, only y=4 is safe among possible, but impossible to reach y=9 from there in time.\n\nWe need to be at a higher y at t=30, but y=5,6,7,8 are dangerous at t=30.\n\nSo we cannot be on any row 1-8 at t=30 except y=4, but y=4 at t=30 is possible only if we stay low, but then we can't reach high.\n\nThe only way to avoid collision at t=30 is to not be on rows 5-8 at that time, but since we must be on some row, and rows 1-4 are safe, we could be on y=1,2,3,4 at t=30.\n\nBut to be on y=1,2,3 at t=30, we need to have moved down, but we have no down actions, only up and stay, so y never decreases, so at t=30, y >=4, so only possible safe y is y=4 at t=30.\n\nBut as above, from y=4 at t=30, we can only reach y<=6 at t=32, but we need y=9 at t=32, impossible.\n\nTherefore, for H=7, it is impossible to reach y=9 at t=32 without being on a dangerous row at t=30 or unable to reach.\n\nBut we must be on a row at t=30, and if it's 5-8, collision, if it's 4, we can't reach y=9 in time.\n\nSo H=7 is also impossible?\n\nBut that can't be.\n\nPerhaps with the stay, we can be at y=4 for multiple turns, but still.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at t=30, we can be on y=9, but earlier we saw it's impossible to reach y=9 by t=30.\n\nAt t=30, y=9 only possible if we started higher or moved faster, impossible.\n\nSo for H=7, we must have y at t=32=9, and at t=30, we must be between y=4 and y=8, but to avoid collision, only y=4 is safe, but from y=4 at t=30 to y=9 at t=32 requires +5 in 2 actions, impossible.\n\nIf we are at higher y at t=30, but it's dangerous.\n\nSo no way for H=7.\n\nThen try H=8.\n\nH=8, then T= t_start + H -1 = 26+8-1=33.\n\ny at t=33 must be 9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=26 to t=32, 7 actions.\n\nNet U - D =5, U + D + S =7.\n\nU = D +5, so (D+5) + D + S =7, 2D + S +5=7, 2D + S=2.\n\nPossible cases:\n- D=0, S=2, U=5\n- D=1, S=0, U=6\n- D=1, S=1, U=6? U= D+5=6, U+D+S=6+1+S=7, so S=0, so only if S=0\n- D=0, S=2, U=5\n- D=1, S=0, U=6\n- D=0, S=2, U=5\n- D=1, S=0, U=6\n- D=2, S=0, U=7, but U+D+S=7+2+0=9>7, no\n\n2D + S=2, so:\n- D=0, S=2, U=5\n- D=1, S=0, U=6\n- D=0, S=2, U=5\n- D=1, S=0, U=6\n- D=2, S=0, U=7, but 2*2 +0=4>2, not\n- Or D=1, S=1, U=6, U+D+S=6+1+1=8>7, not for 7 actions.\n\nU + D + S =7 actions.\n\nU = D +5\n\nSo (D+5) + D + S =7, 2D + S +5=7, 2D + S=2.\n\nSo:\n- If D=0, then S=2, U=5\n- If D=1, then S=0, U=6\n- If D=2, S= -2, impossible\n\nSo two cases: either 5 up, 2 stay, 0 down; or 6 up, 1 down, 0 stay.\n\nNow, we need to be at y=9 at t=33.\n\nAlso, dangerous times around.\n\nFirst, t=30 is still a problem, but with H=8, we have more flexibility.\n\nAlso, t=33 is T, y=9 safe.\n\nNow, dangerous times for t around.\n\nt=30: Δt=4, dangerous y=5,6,7,8\n\nt=31: Δt=5, safe all, as earlier\n\nt=32: Δt=6, dangerous y=4\n\nt=33: Δt=7, dangerous y=4, but we at y=9, safe.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=5,6,7,8 at t=30.\n\nAt t=30, safe rows: y=0,1,2,3,4\n\nBut y>=4, so y=4 safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=32, dangerous for y=4, so we should not be on y=4 at t=32.\n\nNow, with the two cases.\n\nFirst case: U=5, S=2, D=0\n\nNet +5, with 2 stays.\n\nWe can, for example, stay at safe times.\n\nSecond case: U=6, D=1, S=0, net +5, with one down and one up extra.\n\nBut down might help to avoid.\n\nFirst, let's try to use the stay case.\n\nU=5, S=2, D=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at t=33.\n\nStart at t=26, y=4.\n\nWith 5 up and 2 stay, we can have y increase slowly.\n\nFor example, we can stay at t=30 on y=4 to avoid danger.\n\nLet's plan the path to avoid t=30 on dangerous rows.\n\nAt t=30, we want to be on y=4.\n\nSince y=4 at t=30 is safe.\n\nThen from there, we go up to y=9 at t=33.\n\nNow, from t=26 to t=30, we need to be at y=4 at t=30.\n\nt=26 to t=30 is 4 steps: actions at t=26,27,28,29 to reach position at t=30.\n\nAt t=26, y=4.\n\nAt t=30, we want y=4.\n\nSo net change 0 in 4 actions.\n\nWith U=5, S=2, D=0 for the whole, but for this segment, to stay at y=4, we need to have net 0 change, so with 4 actions, U - D =0, U + D + S =4.\n\nSo U=D, 2U + S =4.\n\nPossible U=0,D=0,S=4; or U=1,D=1,S=2; U=2,D=2,S=0, etc.\n\nBut since we have only up and stay for this case, D=0, so U=0, S=4 for the 4 actions: all stay at t=26,27,28,29, so y=4 at all t=26,27,28,29,30.\n\nThen at t=30, y=4, safe.\n\nThen from t=30 to t=33, we need to go to y=9.\n\n3 actions: actions at t=30,31,32 to reach y at t=33=9.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=30 to y=9 at t=33, net +5 in 3 actions.\n\nU - D =5, U + D + S =3.\n\nU = D+5, then (D+5) + D + S =3, 2D + S +5=3, 2D+S= -2, impossible.\n\nCannot reach in 3 actions.\n\nIf we are higher at t=30, but we are at y=4.\n\nWith stays, we can be higher earlier.\n\nFor example, suppose we move up some before t=30.\n\nAt t=26, y=4.\n\nSuppose we take some U actions.\n\nBut at t=30, we need to be at y=4 to be safe.\n\nBut if we move up, y increases, so to be back at y=4 at t=30, we need to move down, but we have no down in this case, only up and stay, so y cannot decrease, so if we ever go up, y >4 at t=30, which could be dangerous if y=5-8.\n\nBut at t=30, y=5-8 dangerous, y=4 safe.\n\nWith only up and stay, if we go up at any point before t=30, y will be at least 5 at t=30, which is dangerous.\n\nIf we never go up before t=30, y=4 at t=30, safe, but then we can't reach y=9 by t=33 with the remaining actions.\n\nSpecifically, from t=30 y=4 to t=33 y=9, with 3 actions, max y=7, not 9.\n\nSo impossible in this case with U=5,S=2,D=0.\n\nNow the other case for H=8: U=6, D=1, S=0.\n\nNet U-D=6-1=5, and U+D+S=6+1+0=7 actions.\n\nWe can move down once.\n\nSo now, we can be at y=4 at t=30 by moving down.\n\nFor example, start at t=26 y=4.\n\nWe can go up to some point, then down to be at y=4 at t=30.\n\nThen from there go up to y=9 at t=33.\n\nFirst, to be at y=4 at t=30.\n\nFrom t=26 to t=30, 4 actions to reach position at t=30.\n\nNet change from y=4 to y=4, so net 0.\n\nWith U and D, U - D =0 for these actions.\n\nBut we have U=6, D=1 for the whole, but for this segment, let's not allocate all.\n\nWe have 7 actions for the whole period.\n\nBut for the first part, to have y=4 at t=30.\n\nFrom t=26 to t=30, positions at t=27,28,29,30 determined by actions at t=26,27,28,29.\n\nAt t=26, y=4.\n\nAfter a26, y at t=27, etc.\n\nAfter a29, y at t=30.\n\nWe want y at t=30 =4.\n\nSo the actions from t=26 to t=29 affect y at t=30.\n\nNumber of actions: 4 actions (t=26 to t=29).\n\nNet effect: from start y=4 to end y=4, so U - D =0 for these 4 actions.\n\nU + D + S =4, but S=0 in this case, so U + D =4, U - D =0, so U=2, D=2.\n\nThen y at t=30=4.\n\nThen from t=30 to t=33, with actions at t=30,31,32, to reach y at t=33=9.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=30 to y=9 at t=33, net +5 in 3 actions.\n\nU - D =5, U + D =3 (since S=0), so U + D =3, U - D =5, add: 2U=8, U=4, D= -1, impossible.\n\nU + D =3, U - D =5, then 2U=8, U=4, but U + D =4 + D =3, so D= -1, impossible.\n\nCannot reach +5 in 3 actions with only U and D.\n\nMax net +3 with 3 U.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, with H=8 and this approach, still impossible.\n\nBut we don't have to be at y=4 at t=30; we can be at other safe rows, but at t=30, only y=4 is safe, and y=0-3 but we can't be there since y>=4.\n\nOr we can be at y=9 at t=30, impossible.\n\nSo for t=30, the only safe row is y=4 for us, but we can't reach y=9 from there in time for t=33.\n\nPerhaps for H=8, we can be at y=9 at t=33, and avoid t=30 by being on a safe row, but only y=4 possible, but then we are behind.\n\nWith the down action, we can be lower at some point, but at t=30, if we are on y=4, we are safe, but then from t=30 to t=33, we need to gain 5 in 3 steps, impossible.\n\nSo we need to be higher at t=30 to have a chance to reach y=9.\n\nBut if we are higher, say y=5 at t=30, but it is dangerous, collision.\n\nUnless we are not on the row at that time, but we have to be somewhere.\n\nAnother idea: at t=30, if we are on y=9, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=4 at t=30, but then we need to move faster later, but we can't.\n\nSo for H=8, T=33, we have more time, so we can stay at lower rows longer.\n\nFor example, at t=30, we are at y=4, safe.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9 at t=33.\n\nWith 3 actions, we can go to y=7 at best, not 9.\n\nBut t=33 is later, so we can take more actions before.\n\nFrom t=30 to t=33, with actions at t=30,31,32, we set y at t=33.\n\nBut to have y=9 at t=33, from y=4 at t=30, we need actions to increase by 5, but only 3 actions, impossible.\n\nSo the position at t=30 must be higher.\n\nBut how to be higher at t=30 without collision.\n\nSince at t=30, y=5-8 are dangerous, we cannot be on them.\n\nSo we must be on y=4 at t=30.\n\nTherefore, for any H, to avoid collision at t=30, we must be on y=4 at t=30.\n\nThen, from t=30 y=4 to y=9 at T, we need at least 5 actions to increase by 5, so T >= t=30 +5 =35, so at t=35, y=9.\n\nThen T = t_start + H -1 = 26 + H -1 =35, so 26 + H -1 =35, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen with H=10, we can be at y=4 at t=30, then move up 5 times to y=9 at t=35.\n\nAnd T=35.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nH=10, T=26+10-1=35, y at t=35=9.\n\nActions from t=26 to t=34.\n\nAt t=30, we are at y=4.\n\nFrom t=26 to t=30, to have y=4 at t=30, with net 0 change in 4 actions, so we can have, for example, all stay or move down and up, but since we have to be at y=4, and start at y=4, with 4 actions, net 0.\n\nThen from t=30 to t=35, with 5 actions, all U, to go to y=9 at t=35.\n\nBut at t=35, y=9, good.\n\nNow, collision: at t=30, y=4, safe.\n\nDuring the path, we need to check other times.\n\nFirst, from t=26 to t=30, we are at y=4 for all times if we stay.\n\nAt t=26 to t=30, y=4.\n\nBut at t=32,33,34, freeway 4 is dangerous.\n\nFreeway 4 dangerous at t=32,33,34 (Δt=6,7,8)\n\nAt t=32, if we are on y=4, collision.\n\nBut in this plan, at t=32, if we are still at y=4, we are on freeway 4 at t=32, which is dangerous.\n\nSo we need to have moved up by then.\n\nIn the plan, from t=30 to t=35, we move up.\n\nAt t=30, y=4\n\nAfter a30=U, t=31 y=5\n\na31=U, t=32 y=6\n\na32=U, t=33 y=7\n\na33=U, t=34 y=8\n\na34=U, t=35 y=9\n\nAt t=32, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nNow, at t=32, Δt=6.\n\nIs freeway 6 dangerous at Δt=6?\n\nFreeway 6 dangerous only at Δt=4, as earlier.\n\nAt Δt=6, t=32, for freeway 6.\n\nCars on freeway 6: similar to freeway 5.\n\nFirst car (24,13,right,12): at Δt=6, span [13 +12*6, 24+12*6] = [13+72,24+72]=[85,96], no 0\n\nSecond car (-48,-59,right,12): span [-59+72, -48+72]=[13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=33, y=7, freeway 7, Δt=7.\n\nFreeway 7 dangerous only at Δt=4, not 7.\n\nCars: [13+84,24+84]=[97,108], [-59+84,-48+84]=[25,36], no 0.\n\nt=34, y=8, freeway 8, Δt=8.\n\nDangerous only at Δt=4, not 8.\n\nCars: [13+96,24+96]=[109,120], [-59+96,-48+96]=[37,48], no 0.\n\nt=35, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, during the stay at y=4 from t=26 to t=30.\n\nAt these times, t=26 to 30, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nBut freeway 4 dangerous only at t=32,33,34, not at t=26-30.\n\nFor example, t=26, Δt=0, span [-35,-24], no 0\n\nt=27, Δt=1, span [-35+4, -24+4]=[-31,-20], no\n\nt=28, Δt=2, [-35+8,-24+8]=[-27,-16], no\n\nt=29, Δt=3, [-35+12,-24+12]=[-23,-12], no\n\nt=30, Δt=4, [-35+16,-24+16]=[-19,-8], no 0\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, this works with H=10.\n\nBut is this minimal H?\n\nEarlier for H=6,7,8 impossible, so H=10 might be minimal.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach earlier with different path.\n\nFor example, with H=8, T=33, y at t=33=9.\n\nIf we can be at higher y at t=30 safely, but we can't.\n\nOr with down action, we can be at y=4 at t=30, but then from there to y=9 at t=33 requires +5 in 3 actions, impossible.\n\nWith H=9, T=26+9-1=34, y at t=34=9.\n\nThen from t=30 y=4 to t=34 y=9, with 4 actions, net +5, so U=5, D=0, S=0, but 4 actions, U=5>4, impossible; U=4, net +4, to y=8 at t=34, not 9.\n\nWith S or D, but net must +5, with 4 actions, max net +4, so y<=8 at t=34, not 9.\n\nThus, minimal H is 10, with T=35.\n\nH=10, actions from t=26 to t=34, 9 actions? Let's count.\n\nActions: a_{t} for t=26 to t=26+H-1=26+10-1=35? t from t₁ to t₁+H-1.\n\nH=10, actions at t=26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34.\n\nThat's 9 actions.\n\nAfter these, position at t=35.\n\nBut we want y at t=35=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=26 to t=34 inclusive, that's 9 actions.\n\nFrom start to end, time from t=26 to t=35, 10 positions, 9 intervals.\n\nWith actions, we have 9 actions for H=10.\n\nNet to y=9 from y=4, net +5.\n\nU - D =5, U + D + S =9.\n\nIn the plan: from t=26 to t=29, we stay at y=4, so actions a26=S, a27=S, a28=S, a29=S, so at t=27,28,29,30 all y=4.\n\nt=26: y=4\n\na26=S, t=27 y=4\n\na27=S, t=28 y=4\n\na28=S, t=29 y=4\n\na29=S, t=30 y=4\n\nThen a30=U, t=31 y=5\n\na31=U, t=32 y=6\n\na32=U, t=33 y=7\n\na33=U, t=34 y=8\n\na34=U, t=35 y=9\n\nAnd a34 is the last action.\n\nNow, collision: as above, at t=30 y=4 safe, t=31 y=5, freeway 5, Δt=5, safe as earlier, similarly t=32 y=6 safe, etc.\n\nAt t=32, y=6, Δt=6, freeway 6 safe.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but H=10 seems large, but earlier smaller H impossible.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier if we don't stay all the time.\n\nFor example, with H=9, T=34, y at t=34=9.\n\nThen we must be at y=4 at t=30 to avoid collision.\n\nThen from t=30 y=4 to t=34 y=9 with 4 actions: net +5.\n\nBut with 4 actions, max net +4, so y<=8 at t=34, cannot be 9.\n\nIf we are at y=5 at t=30, but dangerous, collision.\n\nSo impossible for H=9.\n\nSimilarly H=8, T=33, y=9 at t=33, from t=30 y=4 to t=33 y=9, 3 actions, max y=7, not 9.\n\nSo indeed minimal H=10.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nH=10, actions from t=26 to t=34.\n\nIn the sequence, for t=26 to t=34.\n\nActions: for t=26 to t=29: S (stay)\n\nThen t=30 to t=34: U (up)\n\nBut at t=34, action a34=U to go to y=9 at t=35, but we need y at t=35=9, which is after action.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions up to a_{t₁+H-1} = a_{35}, and position at t=36? No.\n\nt₁+H-1=26+10-1=35, action at t=35.\n\nAfter a35, position at t=36.\n\nBut we want y at t=35=9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nLet's clarify the time.\n\nWith H=10, we want y at t=26+10-1=35 to be 9.\n\nSo at time t=35, position y=9.\n\nActions are from t=26 to t=34? t from t₁ to t₁+H-1=26 to 35? H actions: indices t=0 to H-1 for offset, so actions at times t₁ + t for t=0 to H-1, so times 26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34 for H=10? t from 0 to 9? t=0:26, t=1:27, ..., t=9:35.\n\nSo actions at t=26 to t=35.\n\n10 actions.\n\nAfter action at t, position at t+1.\n\nSo after a26, position at t=27\n\nAfter a27, at t=28\n\n...\n\nAfter a34, at t=35\n\nAfter a35, at t=36\n\nWe want y at t=35 to be 9.\n\ny at t=35 is after action a34.\n\nTo have y at t=35=9, we need that after a34, we are at 9.\n\nSimilarly, at time t=35, we are at y=9, and we take a35, which can be S.\n\nIn the path: start t=26, y=4.\n\nWe need to be at y=4 at t=30.\n\nt=30 is time.\n\nAt time t=30, y=4.\n\nThen from there, to have y at t=35=9.\n\nActions from t=30 to t=34 affect positions up to t=35.\n\nActions: a30 to a34 determine y at t=31 to t=35.\n\nSpecifically, y at t=35 is after a34.\n\nTo go from y at t=30 to y at t=35.\n\ny at t=30=4.\n\nThen after a30, y at t=31\n\n...\n\nAfter a34, y at t=35\n\nSo from t=31 to t=35, 4 steps, but positions at t=31,32,33,34,35.\n\nFrom y at t=30 to y at t=35, 5 positions, but the change is over 5 actions? From t=30 to t=35, the actions at t=30,31,32,33,34 affect the positions.\n\nAfter action at t=30, y at t=31\n\nAfter t=31, y at t=32\n\nAfter t=32, y at t=33\n\nAfter t=33, y at t=34\n\nAfter t=34, y at t=35\n\nSo to have y at t=35=9, it is set by a34.\n\ny at t=35 depends on y at t=34 and a34.\n\nSimilarly, y at t=30 is given.\n\nTo have y at t=35=9, starting from y=4 at t=30, we need to increase by 5 in the 5 actions from t=30 to t=34.\n\nEach action can increase by at most 1, so minimum 5 up actions to gain 5.\n\nThus actions a30=U, a31=U, a32=U, a33=U, a34=U, so that y at t=31=5, t=32=6, t=33=7, t=34=8, t=35=9.\n\nNow, for the period before t=30.\n\nAt t=30, we need to be at y=4.\n\nFrom start t=26 y=4 to t=30 y=4.\n\nActions from t=26 to t=29 determine positions up to t=30.\n\nAfter a29, y at t=30.\n\nWe want y at t=30=4.\n\nSo from t=26 to t=30, with actions a26 to a29.\n\nAfter a26, y at t=27; ... after a29, y at t=30.\n\nTo have y at t=30=4, starting from y=4 at t=26.\n\nNet change 0 in 4 actions.\n\nWith possible actions, we can have, for example, all stay: a26=S, a27=S, a28=S, a29=S, so y at t=27,28,29,30 all 4.\n\nOr move up and down, but with down, we might go lower, but we can.\n\nIn this case, since we have no constraint, all stay is fine.\n\nNow, collision during stay: at t=26 to t=30, y=4, freeway 4, not dangerous as before.\n\nThen at t=31, y=5, freeway 5, Δt=5 (since t=31, Δt=31-26=5), safe.\n\nt=32, y=6, freeway 6, Δt=6, safe.\n\nt=33, y=7, freeway 7, Δt=7, safe.\n\nt=34, y=8, freeway 8, Δt=8, safe.\n\nt=35, y=9, safe.\n\nAnd we need action at t=35, which can be S.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 26: S\n\nTurn 27: S\n\nTurn 28: S\n\nTurn 29: S\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: S  (since at y=9, stay)\n\nIn the sequence, for H=10, actions from t=26 to t=35.\n\nBut at t=35, action a35, which we set to S.\n\nNow, in the answer, we need to list the actions.\n\nBut H=10 seems large, but necessary.\n\nPerhaps we can start moving earlier to be higher when safe.\n\nFor example, at t=26, we can go up, but then at t=27 y=5, etc., but at t=30 we need to be at y=4, so we must have moved down, but with down action.\n\nIn the above, with all stay, it works.\n\nTo make H smaller, but earlier we saw not possible.\n\nAnother thought: at t=30, only freeways 5-8 are dangerous, but we can be on y=4, which is safe.\n\nAnd to reach y=9, we need to pass through y=5-8, but at other times they are safe except t=30.\n\nFor example, y=5 at t=31 is safe, as Δt=5.\n\nSimilarly, all other times safe except t=30.\n\nSo by being at y=4 at t=30, we avoid the only dangerous time for the upper rows.\n\nThen we can move up freely after.\n\nSo the above plan is fine.\n\nMinimal H is 10.\n\nNow, for the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 26: S  \nTurn 27: S  \nTurn 28: S  \nTurn 29: S  \nTurn 30: U  \nTurn 31: U  \nTurn 32: U  \nTurn 33: U  \nTurn 34: U  \nTurn 35: S  \n}\n\nBut Turn 35 is included, and action S.\n\nSince at t=35 we are at y=9, and we take S, stay.\n\nPerhaps we can omit the last action, but the sequence must have H actions.\n\nIn the sequence, all actions are listed.\n\nTo confirm, after a34=U, at t=35 y=9.\n\nThen at t=35, we take a35=S, and at t=36 y=9, but we don't care.\n\nAnd at t=35, we are at y=9, which is the reaching point.\n\nNow, for the car state, we have freeway 4 with multiple cars, but we handled.\n\nIn freeway 4, there is a car at (12,1,right,4), which we said never covers 0, but at some point it might, but earlier we checked it doesn't.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 26\\) with the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The minimal \\(H\\) is 10, meaning the sequence consists of 10 actions from turn 26 to turn 35, and the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 35.\n\n### Key Constraints and Reasoning:\n- **Collision Avoidance**: \n  - At turn \\(t = 30\\) (relative time \\(\\Delta t = 4\\)), freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are dangerous because cars cover \\(x = 0\\). Specifically:\n    - Freeway 5: car \\((-48, -59, \\text{right}, 12)\\) covers \\(x=0\\) at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\).\n    - Freeway 6: car \\((-48, -59, \\text{right}, 12)\\) covers \\(x=0\\) at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\).\n    - Freeway 7: car \\((-48, -59, \\text{right}, 12)\\) covers \\(x=0\\) at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\).\n    - Freeway 8: car \\((-48, -59, \\text{right}, 12)\\) covers \\(x=0\\) at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\).\n  - To avoid collision at \\(t = 30\\), the player must be on a safe freeway. Only \\(y = 4\\) is safe at this time (as \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) have no cars, but \\(y = 0\\) is unreachable from the starting point without moving down).\n  - Freeway 4 is dangerous at turns \\(t = 32, 33, 34\\) (\\(\\Delta t = 6, 7, 8\\)) due to car \\((-24, -35, \\text{right}, 4)\\) covering \\(x=0\\), so the player must avoid \\(y = 4\\) at these times.\n- **Reaching \\(y = 9\\)**:\n  - The earliest possible turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) is turn 31 with all \"U\" actions, but this requires being on \\(y = 8\\) at turn 30, which is dangerous and causes collision.\n  - Attempts with \\(H = 6, 7, 8, 9\\) are impossible due to the collision at \\(t = 30\\) or inability to reach \\(y = 9\\) in the required turns.\n  - With \\(H = 10\\), the player can stay at \\(y = 4\\) until turn 30 (safe), then move up five times to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 35.\n- **Action Sequence**:\n  - Turns 26 to 29: Stay at \\(y = 4\\) using \"S\" to avoid moving to dangerous rows and remain safe.\n  - Turn 30: Move up to \\(y = 5\\) (safe, as \\(t = 30\\) is dangerous only for \\(y = 5-8\\), but moving to \\(y = 5\\) occurs at turn 31).\n  - Turns 31 to 34: Move up each turn to reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 34 and \\(y = 9\\) at turn 35.\n  - Turn 35: Stay at \\(y = 9\\) using \"S\" since the goal is reached.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}_{t=26}^{35}\\) that achieves this with \\(H = 10\\) is:\n\n- At turn 26, stay to remain at \\(y = 4\\) (safe, no collision).\n- At turns 27, 28, and 29, stay to remain at \\(y = 4\\) (safe at \\(t = 30\\)).\n- At turn 30, move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 31 (safe, as \\(t = 31\\) has no dangerous rows).\n- At turns 31, 32, 33, and 34, move up to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 35.\n- At turn 35, stay to remain at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player is never on a dangerous freeway at a dangerous turn and reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 35 with minimal \\(H = 10\\).\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 26: S \\\\  \nTurn 27: S \\\\  \nTurn 28: S \\\\  \nTurn 29: S \\\\  \nTurn 30: U \\\\  \nTurn 31: U \\\\  \nTurn 32: U \\\\  \nTurn 33: U \\\\  \nTurn 34: U \\\\  \nTurn 35: S  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 30, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nImportant note: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has its span such that 0 is in the span (i.e., the car covers the x=0 position at turn T).\n\nAlso note: When the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, then at turn T the player is still on y_T and will be on y_{T+1} only at the next turn. Therefore, at turn T, we only check the freeway y_T for collision.\n\nWe have to output a sequence of actions (U, D, S) starting from turn t1 (which is 30) until we reach y=9.\n\nPlan:\nWe are starting at y0 = 0 (at turn 30). We need to go to y=9. The minimal number of moves without any obstacles would be 9 moves (all U). But we have cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway y at a turn T when there is a car on freeway y that has 0 in its span at that turn T.\n\nWe are going to simulate the car positions at each future turn relative to the starting turn (t1=30). For a car given at t1 with (head, tail, direction, speed), we can compute its span at turn T (T>=t1) as:\n\nIf direction is right:\n   Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\nIf direction is left:\n   Span(T) = [head - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the table given for cars at turn t1. The representation for left and right is different? Actually, looking at the update:\n\nFor left-moving: originally [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\nFor right-moving: originally [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the table, the cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). How are head and tail defined?\n\nLooking at the update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> meaning h is the leftmost? and tau is the rightmost? Actually, note that for left-moving, the head is the leading part? But the update for left: [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. Since the car is moving left, the entire segment shifts left.\n\nSimilarly, for right: [tau, h] becomes [tau+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)]. So in the right case, tau is the leftmost and h is the rightmost? But the table gives (head, tail). So we must interpret:\n\nIn the car state table:\nFor a car: (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor a right-moving car: head is the rightmost? and tail is the leftmost? Because the update for right uses [tau, h] and then shifts right. But in the table it's written as (head, tail). So:\n\nIn the given data, for a right-moving car: \n  head = h (which in the update rule was the rightmost) and tail = tau (the leftmost). \nSo the span at t1 is [tail, head] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: \n  head = h (which in the update rule was the leftmost) and tail = tau (the rightmost). \nSo the span at t1 is [head, tail] for left-moving.\n\nBut note the table only has right-moving cars in this instance.\n\nLet me check the car state:\n\nAll cars are right-moving? \n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3) -> but -48 is greater than -59? So if it's right-moving, then the span at t1 should be [tail, head] = [-59, -48]. But the update rule for right-moving: [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So at t1, the car is from -59 to -48? \n\nBut the problem says: at turn T, collision if 0 is in the span. So we have to check for each freeway we are on, at each turn, whether 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nNow, note that multiple cars per freeway? Yes, for example freeway 4 has 3 cars.\n\nWe must check all cars on the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nWe are going to plan a path. We can use BFS (state: (turn, y)) but note the turn is relative and we are starting at turn 30. Also, the cars move predictably. However, note that the state space in time might be large? But we are minimizing the number of turns, and we can't wait arbitrarily because we must get to 9.\n\nAlternatively, we can simulate turn by turn and check for collisions.\n\nWe need to get from y=0 to y=9. The minimal moves is 9 moves (if we go up every turn). But we might have to wait (use S) to avoid a collision.\n\nWe are going to compute for each freeway and for each future turn (relative to t1=30) whether the freeway is safe at x=0.\n\nBut note: the player moves one freeway at a time. We can also move down? But since we are at 0 and need to go to 9, moving down is not helpful? Actually, we are at y=0 and we cannot go below 0. So at y=0, D would leave us at 0. Similarly, at y=9, we are done.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to go above 9? The update says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So we cannot go above 9. Therefore, when at 9 we are done.\n\nWe start at (0,0) at turn 30. We can only go to y=1 at the next turn? But if we use U at turn 30, we go to y=1 at turn 31. Then at turn 30 we are still at y=0 so no collision? Then at turn 31 we are at y=1 and we check the cars on freeway 1 at turn 31.\n\nSo we need to compute for each freeway (1 to 8) and for each future turn (starting from 30) the set of turns at which the freeway is unsafe (i.e., at least one car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that turn).\n\nLet t0 = 30.\n\nWe will compute for each freeway k and for each turn T (>= t0) whether freeway k is safe at turn T.\n\nBut note: the cars on a freeway are independent.\n\nWe'll create a 2D array: safe[k][t] for freeway k (1<=k<=8) and turn t (t>=t0) that is True if at turn t, freeway k is safe (i.e., no car covers x=0), else False.\n\nHowever, the turns can go arbitrarily? But we are only interested in a bounded number of turns (say up to 50 turns? because minimal is 9, so we can set a limit, say 20 turns).\n\nBut note: the cars move continuously and the grid is infinite? But the car positions are linear in time. We can compute the condition for a car to cover x=0 at time T.\n\nFor a car on freeway k at initial state (h, t, d, s) (h=head, t=tail, d=direction, s=speed) at turn t0=30.\n\nFor a right-moving car (d='right'):\n   span at T: [tail + s*(T-30), head + s*(T-30)]\n   covers 0 if: tail + s*(T-30) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-30)\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving (d='left'):\n   span at T: [head - s*(T-30), tail - s*(T-30)]\n   covers 0 if: head - s*(T-30) <= 0 <= tail - s*(T-30)\n\nBut note: in the table, all cars are right-moving? The direction is given as 'right'. So we only need the right-moving formula.\n\nLet me list all cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=-48, tail=-59, d='right', s=3)\n   => at T: [ -59 + 3*(T-30), -48 + 3*(T-30) ]\n   covers 0 when: -59 + 3*(T-30) <= 0 <= -48 + 3*(T-30)\n\n   Solve:\n     -59 + 3T - 90 <= 0  => 3T <= 149 => T <= 49.666 -> T<=49 (since integer)\n     and 0 <= -48 + 3T - 90 => 0 <= 3T - 138 => 3T>=138 => T>=46\n\n   So T in [46, 49] -> unsafe for freeway 1 at T=46,47,48,49.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway1: unsafe at T=46,47,48,49.\n\nFreeway 3: same: unsafe at T=46,47,48,49.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars:\n\nCar1: (-48,-59,right,4)\n   [ -59 + 4*(T-30), -48 + 4*(T-30) ]\n   unsafe when: -59+4T-120<=0 and 0<=-48+4T-120\n      => 4T <= 179 -> T<=44.75 -> T<=44\n        and 0<=4T-168 -> 4T>=168 -> T>=42\n      So T in [42,44]\n\nCar2: (-12,-23,right,4)\n   [ -23+4*(T-30), -12+4*(T-30) ]\n   unsafe: -23+4T-120<=0 -> 4T<=143 -> T<=35.75 -> T<=35\n           and 0<=-12+4T-120 -> 4T>=132 -> T>=33\n      So T in [33,35]\n\nCar3: (24,13,right,4)  -> wait, head=24, tail=13? But for right-moving, the head is the rightmost? So the span is [13,24] at t0? Then at T: [13+4*(T-30), 24+4*(T-30)]\n   unsafe: 13+4T-120<=0 and 0<=24+4T-120\n        => 4T<=107 -> T<=26.75 -> T<=26\n        and 0<=4T-96 -> 4T>=96 -> T>=24\n      So T in [24,26] -> but we are starting at T=30, so this car doesn't cover 0 at T>=30? Because by T=30, the car is at [13+4*0, 24+4*0] = [13,24] -> 0 not in [13,24]. And as T increases, the car moves to the right, so never covers 0 again? Actually, at T=30, the car is at [13,24] and moves right. So it never covers 0 again? So for T>=30, this car is safe.\n\nTherefore, freeway 4 is unsafe at T in [33,35] (from car2) and [42,44] (from car1). Note: we don't have to consider car3 because it's safe for T>=30.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars.\n\nCar1: (-48,-59,right,12)\n   [ -59+12*(T-30), -48+12*(T-30) ]\n   unsafe: -59+12T-360<=0 -> 12T<=419 -> T<=34.916 -> T<=34\n           and 0<=-48+12T-360 -> 12T>=408 -> T>=34\n        So T=34.\n\nCar2: (0,-11,right,12)\n   [ -11+12*(T-30), 0+12*(T-30) ] = [ -11+12T-360, 12T-360 ]\n   unsafe: -371+12T<=0 -> 12T<=371 -> T<=30.916 -> T<=30\n           and 0<=12T-360 -> 12T>=360 -> T>=30\n        So T=30.\n\nTherefore, freeway 5 is unsafe at T=30 (from car2) and T=34 (from car1).\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway5? \n   Car1: same as above -> unsafe at T=34.\n   Car2: same as above -> unsafe at T=30.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway5: unsafe at T=30,34.\n\nFreeway 8: same: unsafe at T=30,34.\n\nNow, we are going to simulate the player movement.\n\nWe start at turn 30, y=0.\n\nAt turn 30, we are at y=0. We are not on any freeway (freeways are 1-8, and we are at y=0) so no collision? And we don't check freeway 0? The problem says avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8. So at y=0, we are safe.\n\nBut note: we are at (0,0) at turn 30. We can take an action at turn 30 to move to y=1 at turn 31? Or we can stay at 0.\n\nWe want to reach y=9.\n\nWe must plan a sequence of actions.\n\nWe can do:\n\nOption 1: Go up as fast as possible.\n\nTurn 30: U -> y=1 at turn 31.\nBut at turn 31: we are at y=1. Check freeway1: at turn31, is freeway1 safe? From above, freeway1 is unsafe at T=46,47,48,49. So at T=31, safe. So we are safe.\n\nTurn 31: U -> y=2 at turn32.\nAt turn32: freeway2 is safe? same as freeway1: unsafe only at [46,49]. Safe.\n\nTurn32: U -> y=3 at turn33.\nAt turn33: freeway3 is safe? same: unsafe at [46,49]. Safe.\n\nTurn33: U -> y=4 at turn34.\nAt turn34: freeway4: we computed unsafe at T in [33,35] and [42,44]. So at T=34, freeway4 is unsafe? \n   But note: we are at freeway4 at turn34? \n   We need to check: freeway4 is unsafe at T=34? \n      From car1: unsafe in [42,44] -> not 34.\n      From car2: unsafe in [33,35] -> yes, 34 is in [33,35]. So unsafe.\n\nTherefore, at turn34 we would collide if we are on freeway4.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway4 at turn34.\n\nWe must avoid being at freeway4 at turns 33,34,35 and 42,43,44.\n\nBut we are at turn33: we are at freeway3? Then we want to go to freeway4 at turn34? But we are at turn33 at freeway3, then at turn33 we take an action to go to freeway4 at turn34? But then at turn34 we are at freeway4 -> unsafe.\n\nTherefore, we must not move to freeway4 at turn33? We can wait at freeway3 for one turn? But we are at freeway3 at turn33, and we can use S (stay) at turn33 to remain at freeway3 for turn34? Then at turn34 we are still at freeway3? Then at turn34 we can move to freeway4? But then we would be at freeway4 at turn35? And turn35 is unsafe for freeway4? (because [33,35] includes 35).\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid freeway4 during the unsafe turns by waiting or by moving faster? But we can only move one step per turn.\n\nWe have to skip freeway4 during the unsafe period? But we must go through freeway4 to get to 5 and above.\n\nWe can consider waiting at freeway3 until turn36? Then move to freeway4 at turn36? Then at turn36: freeway4 is safe? Because unsafe periods are [33,35] and [42,44]. So at turn36, safe.\n\nBut that would cost extra turns.\n\nLet me try:\n\nTurn30: U -> y=1 at turn31 (safe)\nTurn31: U -> y=2 at turn32 (safe)\nTurn32: U -> y=3 at turn33 (safe)\n\nNow at turn33, we are at y=3. We cannot go to y=4 at turn34 because that would put us at y=4 at turn34 (unsafe). So we can wait at y=3 for one turn? \n\nTurn33: S -> stay at y=3 at turn34? Then at turn34 we are still at y=3 (freeway3). Then we can go to y=4 at turn35? But at turn35, freeway4 is unsafe? So we cannot go at turn35 either.\n\nSo we must wait two turns? Then at turn33: S -> turn34: still at y=3 (safe, because freeway3 is unsafe only at [46,49] which hasn't happened). Then at turn34: S -> turn35: still at y=3. Then at turn35: U -> y=4 at turn36. Then at turn36, freeway4 is safe? Yes.\n\nThen we can proceed:\n\nTurn36: U -> y=5 at turn37.\n\nBut now we are at freeway5 at turn37. We need to check freeway5: unsafe at T=30 and T=34. So at turn37, safe.\n\nThen we can go up:\n\nTurn37: U -> y=6 at turn38 (freeway6: unsafe at T=30,34 -> safe at 38)\nTurn38: U -> y=7 at turn39 (freeway7: safe)\nTurn39: U -> y=8 at turn40 (freeway8: safe)\nTurn40: U -> y=9 at turn41 -> done.\n\nTotal turns: from turn30 to turn40: 11 actions? But note we are counting the actions: we do an action at turn30, turn31, ... turn40: that's 11 actions? And we end at turn41 at y=9? \n\nBut note: at turn40 we do U and then at turn41 we are at y=9. We stop when we first reach y=9? So the last action is at turn40, and then at turn41 we are at y=9. So we need to output the actions from turn30 to turn40 (11 actions).\n\nBut we can check if we can do better.\n\nAlternatively, we might try to go faster through freeway4? But the unsafe window is [33,35] for freeway4. We are at freeway3 at turn33. We cannot go to freeway4 at turn34 (unsafe) or turn35 (unsafe). So we have to wait until turn36 to go to freeway4. So that seems necessary.\n\nBut what about freeways 5-8? They are unsafe at T=30 and 34. We are not at those freeways at those turns? We are at freeway5 at turn37, which is after 34, so safe.\n\nBut wait: is there a problem at freeway5? We are at freeway5 at turn37: safe. Similarly for 6,7,8.\n\nBut what about freeway4 again? We have a second unsafe period [42,44]. But we are at freeway4 only at turn36? Then we leave to freeway5 at turn37. So we are never at freeway4 during [42,44]. So safe.\n\nSo the plan:\n\nTurn30: U -> y=1\nTurn31: U -> y=2\nTurn32: U -> y=3\nTurn33: S -> y=3 (wait)\nTurn34: S -> y=3 (wait)\nTurn35: U -> y=4   (at turn36 we are at y=4? Actually, at turn35 we are at y=3 and we do U, so at turn36 we are at y=4? But we need to check: the action at turn35: U -> so at turn36, y=4. Then at turn36, we are at freeway4. And we said at turn36, freeway4 is safe? Yes, because unsafe only at [33,35] and [42,44]. 36 is not in either.\n\nBut wait: we have to be careful about the turn when we are at a freeway.\n\nAt turn35: we are at y=3 (from the previous turn: turn34 we were at y=3 and we did S at turn34? Actually, let me write the state:\n\nTurn30: start at y=0. Action: U -> at turn31: y=1.\nTurn31: at y=1, action: U -> at turn32: y=2.\nTurn32: at y=2, action: U -> at turn33: y=3.\nTurn33: at y=3, action: S -> at turn34: y=3.\nTurn34: at y=3, action: S -> at turn35: y=3.\nTurn35: at y=3, action: U -> at turn36: y=4.\n\nSo at turn36: we are at y=4. Then we do:\n\nTurn36: U -> at turn37: y=5.\nTurn37: U -> at turn38: y=6.\nTurn38: U -> at turn39: y=7.\nTurn39: U -> at turn40: y=8.\nTurn40: U -> at turn41: y=9.\n\nSo we have 11 actions: from turn30 to turn40.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in fewer?\n\nWhat if we go down? But we are at y=0, we cannot go down. And we have to go up.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid freeway4 by going through it at a safe time? We already are.\n\nBut note: we are waiting two turns at y=3. Is there a way to wait less?\n\nWe could try to go to freeway4 earlier? But the unsafe period for freeway4 starts at turn33. We are at freeway3 at turn33. We cannot go to freeway4 at turn33? Because we are at freeway3 at turn33 and we take an action at turn33 to go to freeway4 at turn34? But that is unsafe. And we cannot get to freeway4 at turn32? How?\n\nWe were at freeway2 at turn32: if we go up at turn32, we go to freeway3 at turn33. But we need to get to freeway4 at a safe time. The next safe time for freeway4 is turn36. So we have to wait at freeway3 for 3 turns? (turn33,34,35) and then go to freeway4 at turn36? But that is 3 waits? Then we do:\n\nTurn30: U -> y1\nTurn31: U -> y2\nTurn32: U -> y3 (at turn33 we are at y3)\nThen we wait at y3 for 3 turns: \n   Turn33: S -> y3 at turn34\n   Turn34: S -> y3 at turn35\n   Turn35: S -> y3 at turn36\n   Turn36: U -> y4 at turn37\n   ... then same as before: 12 actions? to get to y9 at turn42? That is worse.\n\nBut earlier I did only two waits? So from turn33 to turn35: two S actions? Then at turn36 we go to y4.\n\nBut note: we are at y3 at turn33 (after the U at turn32). Then we do:\n   Turn33: S -> at turn34: y3\n   Turn34: S -> at turn35: y3\n   Turn35: U -> at turn36: y4\n\nSo that's two S and then U at turn35. Then we proceed.\n\nTotal actions: \n   turn30: U\n   turn31: U\n   turn32: U\n   turn33: S\n   turn34: S\n   turn35: U\n   turn36: U (to y5)\n   turn37: U (y6)\n   turn38: U (y7)\n   turn39: U (y8)\n   turn40: U (y9)\n\nThat's 11 actions.\n\nBut wait: at turn40 we do U and then at turn41 we are at y9. So we have done 11 actions and we are done at turn41.\n\nIs there a way to do it in 10 actions?\n\nWe must get from y0 to y9: that requires 9 moves. But we have to avoid the unsafe times. We had to wait 2 extra turns. So 9+2=11.\n\nBut can we avoid waiting by taking a detour? We cannot go below 0, and we cannot go above 9 until we are done. And we have to go through each freeway? Actually, we can skip a freeway? But we must go from 0 to 9, so we have to go through each level? No, we can skip a level by going two moves? But no, we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo we must go through each freeway in order? Not necessarily: we can go up and then down? But that would cost more moves. For example, going to y4 and then back to y3? That would be worse.\n\nSo 11 moves seems minimal.\n\nBut let me check if we can avoid the two waits by being at a different freeway at the unsafe time? We have to be at freeway4 eventually. And we have to be at freeway4 at some turn. The safe turns for freeway4 are T<33 or T>35 and T<42? So we can be at freeway4 at T=36,37,...,41? But we are at freeway3 at turn33. The earliest we can be at freeway4 is turn34? But turn34 is unsafe. Then turn35 is unsafe. Then turn36 is safe. So we have to wait until turn36 to be at freeway4.\n\nBut we can be at freeway4 at turn32? How? \n\nWe start at y0 at turn30. \nTurn30: U -> y1 at turn31.\nTurn31: U -> y2 at turn32.\nTurn32: U -> y3 at turn33. \nBut we want to be at y4 at turn32? That would require two moves in one turn? Not possible.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway4 before turn33? \n\nAt turn30: we are at y0. \nIf we do U at turn30: y1 at turn31.\nIf we do U at turn31: y2 at turn32.\nThen we can do U at turn32: y3 at turn33.\nWe cannot get to y4 before turn34? Because at turn33 we are at y3, and then we do U at turn33: then at turn34 we are at y4.\n\nBut turn34 is unsafe. So we cannot avoid the wait.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of turns is 11.\n\nNow, let's write the actions:\n\nTurn30: U\nTurn31: U\nTurn32: U\nTurn33: S   (stay at y3)\nTurn34: S   (stay at y3)\nTurn35: U   (to y4 at turn36)\nTurn36: U   (to y5 at turn37)\nTurn37: U   (to y6 at turn38)\nTurn38: U   (to y7 at turn39)\nTurn39: U   (to y8 at turn40)\nTurn40: U   (to y9 at turn41)\n\nBut note: at turn40 we do U and we reach y9 at turn41. We are done at turn41. So the sequence of actions is from turn30 to turn40 (11 actions).\n\nBut let me double-check the collision at each step:\n\nTurn30: at y0 -> safe (not on freeway)\nTurn31: at y1 -> freeway1: T=31 -> safe (because unsafe at 46-49)\nTurn32: at y2 -> freeway2: safe\nTurn33: at y3 -> freeway3: safe\nTurn34: at y3 -> freeway3: safe (we are still at y3, so we check freeway3: unsafe only at 46-49 -> safe)\nTurn35: at y3 -> freeway3: safe\nTurn36: at y4 -> freeway4: T=36 -> safe? \n   freeway4 unsafe at [33,35] and [42,44]. 36 is not in any -> safe.\nTurn37: at y5 -> freeway5: T=37 -> unsafe at T=30,34 -> 37 safe.\nTurn38: at y6 -> freeway6: same as freeway5 -> safe.\nTurn39: at y7 -> freeway7: safe.\nTurn40: at y8 -> freeway8: safe.\n\nAnd then at turn41 we are at y9 -> done.\n\nBut note: at turn35 we are at y3 and we do U, so at turn36 we are at y4. And at turn36 we are at freeway4: we must check freeway4 at turn36: safe.\n\nBut what about the second car on freeway4? We have car1: unsafe at [42,44] and car2: unsafe at [33,35]. So at turn36, both are safe.\n\nSimilarly, at freeway5: car1: unsafe at T=34, car2: unsafe at T=30. So at T=37, safe.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer:\n\nTurn t_1 (30): U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: S\nTurn 34: S\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\n\nWe have 11 actions.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence\". We have H=11.\n\nIs there a way to do it in 10? \n\nSuppose we try to go faster at the beginning? We start at y0 at turn30. \nWe do U at turn30 -> y1 at turn31.\nU at turn31 -> y2 at turn32.\nBut then at turn32 we are at y2. We want to get to y3 as soon as possible? But we did that. \n\nAlternatively, we might avoid freeway4 by going through it at a time that we skip? But we can't.\n\nOr we might wait at a different freeway? \n\nFor example, if we wait at freeway2? \n\nTurn30: U -> y1 at31.\nTurn31: U -> y2 at32.\nThen we wait at y2: \n   Turn32: S -> y2 at33.\n   Turn33: S -> y2 at34.\n   Turn34: U -> y3 at35.\n   Turn35: U -> y4 at36 (safe) -> then same as before: \n        then U at36: y5 at37, ... until y9 at41? \n        That would be: \n          turn30: U\n          turn31: U\n          turn32: S\n          turn33: S\n          turn34: U\n          turn35: U\n          turn36: U\n          turn37: U\n          turn38: U\n          turn39: U\n          turn40: U -> 11 actions.\n\nSame number.\n\nOr if we wait only one turn at freeway2? \n\nTurn30: U -> y1 at31\nTurn31: U -> y2 at32\nTurn32: S -> y2 at33\nTurn33: U -> y3 at34\nTurn34: U -> y4 at35 -> but at turn35, freeway4 is unsafe? So we collide.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nTherefore, 11 is minimal.\n\nSo the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: S\nTurn 34: S\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\n}\n\nNote: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on. So we write the actions for turns 30 to 40.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Here H=11, so t from 0 to 10? \n\nSo:\na_{30} = U\na_{31} = U\n...\na_{40} = U\n\nYes.\n\nSo we output:\n\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: S\nTurn 34: S\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\n\nBut note: the freeway5 to freeway8 also have unsafe times at T=30 and T=34, but we are not there at those times.\n\nOne more thing: freeway5 at T=30: we are at turn30 at y0 -> not on freeway5. And at T=34: we are at y3 (if we follow the above plan) -> not on freeway5. Similarly for others.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 30\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by waiting at \\(y = 3\\) during turns when \\(y = 4\\) is unsafe.\n\n- Freeway 4 is unsafe at turns 33, 34, and 35 due to car collisions. Therefore, the player must not be on freeway 4 during these turns.\n- The player moves up to \\(y = 3\\) by turn 33 and waits there for two turns (using \"S\" actions) to avoid moving to \\(y = 4\\) during the unsafe period.\n- After turn 35, the player moves up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 36, which is safe, and continues moving up to \\(y = 9\\) by turn 41.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- Turn 30: U (move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 31, safe as freeway 1 is unsafe only at turns 46–49)\n- Turn 31: U (move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 32, safe as freeway 2 is unsafe only at turns 46–49)\n- Turn 32: U (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 33, safe as freeway 3 is unsafe only at turns 46–49)\n- Turn 33: S (stay at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 34, safe)\n- Turn 34: S (stay at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 35, safe)\n- Turn 35: U (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 36, safe as freeway 4 is unsafe only at turns 33–35 and 42–44)\n- Turn 36: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 37, safe as freeway 5 is unsafe only at turns 30 and 34)\n- Turn 37: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 38, safe as freeway 6 is unsafe only at turns 30 and 34)\n- Turn 38: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 39, safe as freeway 7 is unsafe only at turns 30 and 34)\n- Turn 39: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 40, safe as freeway 8 is unsafe only at turns 30 and 34)\n- Turn 40: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 41, completing the goal)\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) in 11 turns without collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 30: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 31: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 32: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 33: & \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 34: & \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 35: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 36: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 37: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 38: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 39: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 40: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 2) at turn t_1 = 32. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and each freeway has cars moving left or right with given speeds. Collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is within the span of some car at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that if the player moves to a new freeway at turn T, they are not on that new freeway until turn T+1. So at turn T, when they move, they are still on the previous freeway for collision purposes.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1=32, and I need to compute their positions at future turns based on the update rules.\n\nLet me list all the cars and their states at t_1=32.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, head h=-42, tail τ=-53, direction right, speed 3. Since it's right-moving, the span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-53, -42]. I think I need to be careful with head and tail. The notation says: for right-moving, span is [τ, h] meaning tail to head, so tail is left, head is right.\n\nIn the update rule: for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h], and at T, it becomes [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it's [h, τ] to [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)].\n\nBut in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving, based on the data.\n\nLet's check:\n\nFreeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3) — head -42, tail -53? That seems odd because if it's right-moving, head should be greater than tail if moving right.\n\n-42 is greater than -53, since -42 > -53, so if it's moving right, head at -42, tail at -53, so the car is from x=-53 to x=-42, and since moving right, at future time, x increases.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 4: (-40, -51, right, 4) — head -40, tail -51, so -40 > -51, so span [ -51, -40 ].\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nAll cars are right-moving in this state.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y, and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of some car, meaning min(span) <= 0 <= max(span).\n\nSince the car is moving, we need to check if 0 is between the tail and head at time T.\n\nPlayer position: at each turn, the player is at (0, y_t), so we care about x=0.\n\nAt turn T, if player is on freeway k, then we check if there is a car on freeway k such that at time T, 0 is in [min(span), max(span)].\n\nNow, the player starts at y=2.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, and there are no cars on y=9, since cars are on y=1 to 8. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, as boundaries.\n\nThe vertical axis is y=0 to 9, and freeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nSo y=0 and y=9 should be safe positions.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,2), so on freeway 2? y=2 is freeway 2.\n\nFreeway k corresponds to y=k, I think.\n\nIn the table, freeway k for k=1 to 8.\n\nSo at y=2, there is a car: freeway 2 has (-42, -53, right, 3)\n\nAt t=32, span is [-53, -42] for that car.\n\nNow, since it's moving right at speed 3, at time T, span is [ -53 + 3(T-32), -42 + 3(T-32) ]\n\nWe need to see when this car has 0 in its span, meaning when min <= 0 <= max.\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nBut collision depends on the player being on that freeway at that time.\n\nNow, the player can move up, down, or stay to change y.\n\nTo minimize H, I probably want to go up as much as possible, but I need to avoid collisions, so I have to time the moves to when the freeway is clear at x=0.\n\nAlso, since moving to a new y at turn T means you are on the old y at turn T, and only on the new y from T+1 onward.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nSuppose at turn T, player is at y_T.\n\nAction a_T is taken, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThen, at turn T, for collision check, we use y_T to see which freeway the player is on, and check if for that freeway, at time T, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nIf not, safe.\n\nThen at T+1, player is at y_{T+1}, and we check for freeway y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so at turn T, you are on y_T, and only at T+1 you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nSo collision at T depends on y_T and cars at T.\n\nNow, the player needs to go from y=2 to y=9, so they need to move up 7 times, but they can also move down or stay, which might be necessary to wait for a clear path.\n\nSince the goal is to minimize H, moving down or staying increases H, so it's better to avoid that if possible, but sometimes necessary to wait.\n\nH is the number of turns from t_1 to t_1+H-1, so at turn t_1, we start, and after H actions, at turn t_1+H-1, we should be at y=9.\n\nLet's define the turns.\n\nLet t_1 = 32.\n\nPlayer position at turn 32: y=2.\n\nAction a_{32} is taken, which affects y_{33}.\n\nThen at turn 32, collision check: is player on a freeway with car at x=0 at t=32.\n\nSince y=2, freeway 2.\n\nThen after a_{32}, y_{33} is set.\n\nAt turn 33, check collision based on y_{33}, and so on.\n\nUntil at some turn T, y_T = 9, and we stop.\n\nT = t_1 + H - 1 for some H.\n\nThe sequence is actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H - 1}, and after H actions, we are at y_{t_1 + H} = 9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t_1, position is given as (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,2)\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, we go to y_{t_1 + 1}\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + 1}, y_{t_1 + 2}, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k, position y_{t_1 + k}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9 for some H.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1 to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAlso, in the action sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H - 1}\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H, but the position at turn t_1 + H - 1 is after H-1 actions? Let's clarify.\n\nSet t_1 = 32.\n\nAt turn 32, position y_{32} = 2.\n\nThen action a_{32} is applied, so at turn 33, position y_{33} = y_{32} + Δy_{32}\n\nSimilarly, action a_{33} applied, turn 34, y_{34} = y_{33} + Δy_{33}, and so on.\n\nAfter action a_{t}, we have y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t.\n\nWe want that at some turn T, y_T = 9.\n\nT = t_1 + H - 1 for some H.\n\nAnd actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H - 2} are applied to reach from y_{t_1} to y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nLet's think of the turns.\n\nAt turn 32: y_32 = 2\n\nAction a_32: determines y_33\n\nAt turn 33: y_33, collision check based on y_33 and cars at t=33? No.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn when the player is on that position.\n\nAt turn T, the player is at position (0, y_T), and we check if for freeway y_T, at time T, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nIf yes, collision.\n\nSo for turn T, we need y_T such that for freeway y_T, no car has 0 in span at time T.\n\nThen action a_T is taken, which sets y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nWe start at turn t_1=32, y=2.\n\nFirst, at turn 32, we need to check if at t=32, on freeway 2, is there collision?\n\nThat is, is 0 in the span of any car on freeway 2 at t=32.\n\nFreeway 2 has one car: span at t=32 is [-53, -42] for the car, since right-moving, min= -53, max= -42, so 0 is not between -53 and -42, since -42 < 0? -42 is less than 0, -53 < -42 < 0, so 0 > max, so 0 not in span. So no collision at t=32 on y=2.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but we only care about the one we're on.\n\nSo at t=32, safe.\n\nNow, we need to choose action a_32: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, y_33 = 3\n\nIf D, y_33 = 1\n\nIf S, y_33 = 2\n\nBut y must be in 0-9, y=2, D to 1, U to 3, S to 2, all possible.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9 quickly.\n\ny=9 is 7 steps up from y=2.\n\nBut we have to go through y=3 to y=8, each with cars.\n\nFirst, I need to know for each freeway, when it is safe at x=0.\n\nThat is, for each k=1 to 8, and for each time T, is there a car on freeway k such that 0 is in its span at T.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, we need to check all cars on that freeway.\n\nIf for a given k and T, no car on k has 0 in span, then freeway k is safe at time T.\n\nOtherwise, not safe.\n\nPlayer can be on freeway k only when it is safe at that time.\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn T, player is on y_T, so must be safe at that time.\n\nNow, let's list all cars and their span functions.\n\nGeneral: for a car, at time T, span depends on initial at t_1=32, speed s, direction.\n\nSince all right-moving, direction right.\n\nFor a car with head h, tail τ at t=32, speed s, right-moving.\n\nAt time T, tail position: τ + s(T - 32)\n\nHead position: h + s(T - 32)\n\nSpan: [τ + s(T-32), h + s(T-32)]\n\n0 in span if τ + s(T-32) <= 0 <= h + s(T-32)\n\nSince for right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so min is tail, max is head.\n\nSo 0 in span if min <= 0 <= max, i.e., τ + s(T-32) <= 0 <= h + s(T-32)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all right.\n\nNow, for each freeway, list the cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: h=-42, τ=-53, s=3, right\n\nAt T, min = -53 + 3(T-32)\n\nMax = -42 + 3(T-32)\n\n0 in span if -53 + 3(T-32) <= 0 <= -42 + 3(T-32)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-42, -53, right, 3) so same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 2: (-42, -53, right, 3) yes, identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: also (-42, -53, right, 3), same.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars:\n\nFirst: h=-40, τ=-51, s=4, right\n\nSecond: h=-4, τ=-15, s=4, right? The data says: (-40, -51, right, 4), (-4, -15, right, 4), (32, 21, right, 4)\n\nNow, for the second car, h=-4, τ=-15? -4 and -15, if right-moving, head should be greater, but -4 > -15, yes -4 > -15.\n\nSimilarly, third: (32, 21, right, 4), h=32, τ=21, 32>21, so head at 32, tail at 21.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: (-24, -35, right, 12), and (24, 13, right, 12)\n\n-24 and -35, -24 > -35, so head -24, tail -35? Tail should be left, so if moving right, tail is smaller x.\n\nx decreasing left, increasing right, I assume.\n\nSo for freeway 5, first car: h=-24, τ=-35, s=12\n\nSecond car: h=24, τ=13, s=12\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5? (-24, -35, right, 12), (24, 13, right, 12) yes.\n\nFreeway 7: same.\n\nFreeway 8: same.\n\nSo actually, freeways 1,2,3 are identical with one car each.\n\nFreeways 5,6,7,8 are identical with two cars each.\n\nFreeway 4 has three cars.\n\nNow, for each, find when 0 is occupied, i.e., when min <= 0 <= max for some car.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1 (and similarly 2,3):\n\nCar: min_T = -53 + 3(T-32)\n\nmax_T = -42 + 3(T-32)\n\n0 in span if min_T <= 0 <= max_T\n\nSo -53 + 3(T-32) <= 0 and 0 <= -42 + 3(T-32)\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: -53 + 3(T-32) <= 0 => 3(T-32) <= 53 => T-32 <= 53/3 ≈ 17.666, so T <= 32 + 17 = 49? 53/3 = 17.666, so T-32 <= 17.666, since T integer, T-32 <= 17, T <= 49? Let's calculate.\n\n-53 + 3(T-32) <= 0\n\n3(T-32) <= 53\n\nT-32 <= 53/3 = 17 + 2/3, so T-32 <= 17 since T integer? No, inequality.\n\nSince T integer, T-32 <= floor(53/3) but better to keep fractional.\n\n3(T-32) <= 53, so T-32 <= 53/3 ≈17.666, so for integer T, T-32 <= 17, because 17*3=51 <=53, 18*3=54>53.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -42 + 3(T-32) => 42 <= 3(T-32) => 3(T-32) >= 42 => T-32 >= 14.\n\nSo overall, 0 in span when T-32 >=14 and T-32 <=17? From above:\n\nT-32 >=14 and T-32 <=17 (since 17*3=51<=53, 18*3=54>53, so min_T <=0 when T-32 <=17, because min_T = -53 +3(T-32) <=0 when 3(T-32)<=53, T-32<=17.666, so T-32<=17 for integer T.\n\nSimilarly, max_T = -42 +3(T-32) >=0 when 3(T-32)>=42, T-32>=14.\n\nSo for T-32 from 14 to 17 inclusive, 0 in span.\n\nT-32 =14,15,16,17.\n\nSo at T=32+14=46, 47,48,49.\n\nT-32=14: T=46\n\nT-32=15: T=47\n\nT-32=16: T=48\n\nT-32=17: T=49\n\nSo for freeway 1, occupied at T=46,47,48,49.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3, same since identical cars.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: h=-40, τ=-51, s=4, right\n\nmin_T = -51 +4(T-32)\n\nmax_T = -40 +4(T-32)\n\n0 in span if -51 +4(T-32) <=0 <= -40 +4(T-32)\n\nSo from -51 +4(T-32) <=0 => 4(T-32) <=51 => T-32 <= 51/4 = 12.75, so T-32 <=12\n\nAnd 0 <= -40 +4(T-32) => 40 <=4(T-32) => T-32 >=10\n\nSo T-32 >=10 and T-32 <=12, so T=42,43,44.\n\nT-32=10: T=42\n\nT-32=11: T=43\n\nT-32=12: T=44\n\nSecond car: h=-4, τ=-15, s=4, right\n\nmin_T = -15 +4(T-32) ? τ=-15, so min = τ + s(T-32) = -15 +4(T-32)\n\nmax = h + s(T-32) = -4 +4(T-32)\n\n0 in span if -15 +4(T-32) <=0 <= -4 +4(T-32)\n\nFirst: -15 +4(T-32) <=0 => 4(T-32) <=15 => T-32 <=15/4=3.75, so T-32 <=3\n\nSecond: 0 <= -4 +4(T-32) => 4 <=4(T-32) => T-32 >=1\n\nSo T-32 >=1 and T-32 <=3, so T=33,34,35.\n\nT-32=1: T=33\n\nT-32=2: T=34\n\nT-32=3: T=35\n\nThird car: h=32, τ=21, s=4, right\n\nmin_T = 21 +4(T-32)\n\nmax_T = 32 +4(T-32)\n\n0 in span if 21 +4(T-32) <=0 <=32 +4(T-32)\n\nBut min_T =21 +4(T-32) >=21 >0 for all T>=32, since T-32>=0, min_T >=21>0, so 0 <= min_T is false, so 0 never <= min_T, and since min_T >0, max_T > min_T >0, so 0 < min_T, not in span. So this car never covers x=0.\n\nSo for freeway 4, occupied when:\n\n- First car: T=42,43,44\n\n- Second car: T=33,34,35\n\n- Third car: never\n\nSo overall, freeway 4 occupied at T=33,34,35,42,43,44.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars, similar for 6,7,8.\n\nFirst car: h=-24, τ=-35, s=12, right\n\nmin_T = -35 +12(T-32)\n\nmax_T = -24 +12(T-32)\n\n0 in span if -35 +12(T-32) <=0 <= -24 +12(T-32)\n\nFirst: -35 +12(T-32) <=0 => 12(T-32) <=35 => T-32 <= 35/12 ≈2.916, so T-32 <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +12(T-32) => 24 <=12(T-32) => T-32 >=2\n\nSo T-32 >=2 and T-32 <=2, so T-32=2, T=34.\n\nAt T=34, occupied.\n\nSecond car: h=24, τ=13, s=12, right\n\nmin_T =13 +12(T-32)\n\nmax_T =24 +12(T-32)\n\nmin_T >=13>0 for T>=32, so 0 < min_T, not in span. Never covers x=0.\n\nSo for freeway 5, occupied only at T=34.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6,7,8, same since identical.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the times when it is occupied (not safe) at x=0.\n\ny=1: freeway 1, occupied at T=46,47,48,49\n\ny=2: freeway 2, same as y=1, occupied at 46,47,48,49\n\ny=3: freeway 3, same, occupied at 46,47,48,49\n\ny=4: freeway 4, occupied at T=33,34,35,42,43,44\n\ny=5: freeway 5, occupied at T=34\n\ny=6: freeway 6, occupied at T=34\n\ny=7: freeway 7, occupied at T=34\n\ny=8: freeway 8, occupied at T=34\n\nAnd for other times, safe.\n\nNow, player starts at turn 32, y=2.\n\nAt turn 32, y=2, which is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so always safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to be at y=8 or something and move up.\n\nThe path: from y=2 to y=3 to ... to y=8 to y=9.\n\nEach move up takes one turn, but we can stay or move down to adjust timing.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we should go up as much as possible without colliding.\n\nStart at t=32, y=2, safe.\n\nNow, choose action a_32.\n\nIf we go up, a_32=U, then y_33=3.\n\nBut at t=33, y=3, freeway 3 is occupied only at T=46-49, which are later, so at t=33, y=3 should be safe? Freeway 3 occupied at 46,47,48,49, not at 33, so yes, safe.\n\nFreeway 3 safe except at 46-49.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to y=1, but that might not help, since we need to go up eventually.\n\nOr stay, but staying delays.\n\nSo probably go up.\n\na_32=U, then at turn 33, y_33=3.\n\nAt turn 33, position y=3, freeway 3, which is safe at t=33, since not occupied.\n\nNow action a_33: if U, y_34=4.\n\nAt turn 34, y=4.\n\nFreeway 4 at t=34: occupied? From above, freeway 4 occupied at 33,34,35,42,43,44.\n\nSo at t=34, occupied, so if player is on y=4 at t=34, collision.\n\nBut at turn 34, if y_34=4, then we are on freeway 4 at t=34, which is occupied, so collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on y=4 at t=34.\n\nNow, if we go up from y=3 to y=4 at turn 33, action a_33=U, then at turn 34, y_34=4, which is occupied, collision.\n\nIf we stay at y=3, a_33=S, then y_34=3.\n\nAt turn 34, y=3, freeway 3, which is safe at t=34, not occupied until 46.\n\nThen at turn 34, position y=3, safe.\n\nThen we can choose a_34.\n\nIf we go up, a_34=U, y_35=4.\n\nAt turn 35, y=4, freeway 4 occupied at t=35? Yes, 35 is occupied time.\n\nSo collision at t=35.\n\nIf we stay again, delay.\n\nBut freeway 4 is occupied until t=35, then safe until t=42.\n\nAfter t=35, next occupied at t=42.\n\nSo from t=36 to 41, freeway 4 is safe, except t=42,43,44 occupied.\n\nt=36 to 41 safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 34, if we are at y=3, safe.\n\nWe can go to y=4 at a later time when it is safe.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=3 for some turns.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nSince y=5,6,7,8 are all occupied only at t=34.\n\nAt t=34, all y=5,6,7,8 are occupied.\n\nBut at other times, they are safe.\n\nFor example, y=5: occupied only at t=34, so for t<34 or t>34, safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, back to player.\n\nStart: t=32, y=2, safe.\n\na_32: let's say U, to y=3 at t=33.\n\nt=33, y=3, safe.\n\nNow at t=33, we need to choose a_33.\n\nIf U, to y=4 at t=34, but t=34 y=4 occupied, collision.\n\nIf S, stay y=3, then at t=34, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=34, a_34: if U to y=4 at t=35, but t=35 y=4 occupied, collision.\n\nIf S again, y=3 at t=35, safe, but then at t=35, if we go U, y_36=4.\n\nAt turn 36, y=4, which is safe? Freeway 4 at t=36: occupied times are 33,34,35,42,43,44, so t=36 not occupied, safe.\n\nThen we can do that.\n\nSo one way: at t=33, S (stay), then at t=34, S (stay), then at t=35, U to y=4 at t=36? Let's sequence.\n\nAt turn 33: position y=3, action a_33=S, so y_34=3.\n\nAt turn 34: position y=3, safe. Action a_34=S, then y_35=3.\n\nAt turn 35: position y=3, safe. Action a_34? a_34 is at turn 34, sets y_35.\n\nAt turn 35: position y=3, action a_35=U, so y_36=4.\n\nThen at turn 36: position y=4, which is safe (since t=36 not occupied).\n\nThen we can go up from there.\n\nBut we have to go to y=9.\n\nNow, from y=4, we can go up to y=5, etc.\n\nBut y=5,6,7,8 are only occupied at t=34, which is past, so for t>34, they are safe except y=4 has future occupied at 42,43,44.\n\nBut we are at t=36, y=4.\n\nIf we go up immediately, a_36=U, y_37=5.\n\nAt turn 37, y=5, freeway 5 is safe since occupied only at t=34, and t=37>34.\n\nSimilarly, we can keep going up.\n\nBut let's see the times.\n\nPlayer at t=36, y=4.\n\na_36=U, to y=5 at t=37.\n\nt=37, y=5, safe.\n\na_37=U, to y=6 at t=38.\n\nt=38, y=6, safe.\n\na_38=U, to y=7 at t=39.\n\nt=39, y=7, safe.\n\na_39=U, to y=8 at t=40.\n\nt=40, y=8, safe (occupied only at t=34).\n\na_40=U, to y=9 at t=41.\n\nAt turn 41, y=9, which is the goal, and since y=9 has no cars, always safe.\n\nBut we need to reach at turn t_1 + H - 1 = 32 + H -1.\n\nNow, at which turn are we at y=9?\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 41, y=41? Turn t, y_t.\n\nStart: turn 32, y=2\n\nAfter a_32=U: turn 33, y=3\n\na_33=S: turn 34, y=3 (since S)\n\na_34=S: turn 35, y=3 (S again)\n\na_35=U: turn 36, y=4\n\na_36=U: turn 37, y=5\n\na_37=U: turn 38, y=6\n\na_38=U: turn 39, y=7\n\na_39=U: turn 40, y=8\n\na_40=U: turn 41, y=9\n\nSo at turn 41, y=9, which is the target position.\n\nt_1 + H - 1 = 41, t_1=32, so 32 + H -1 =41, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions: from a_32 to a_40, that's 9 actions? Let's list:\n\nActions: a_32 (at t=32), a_33 (t=33), ..., up to a_40 (t=40), that's actions at t=32 to 40, which is 9 actions.\n\nH is the number of turns, or the number of actions?\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to H-1, that's H actions.\n\nThen after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 41, which is t_1 + 9? t_1=32, 32+9=41, yes.\n\ny_{41} =9.\n\nAnd we reached at turn 41.\n\nNow, H such that t_1 + H -1 =41, 32 + H -1 =41, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from a_{32} to a_{41}? No.\n\nSequence: actions for t=0 to H-1: a_{t_1 + 0} to a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nHere t_1=32, so a_{32} to a_{32 + H -1}\n\nAfter these actions, position at turn (t_1 + H) should be? No.\n\nAfter action a_t, position at t+1.\n\nAfter actions from a_{32} to a_{32+H-1}, the last action a_{32+H-1} sets y_{32+H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{32 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{32 + H -1} is the position at turn 32 + H -1.\n\nThis is set by the previous action.\n\nFor example, at turn T, y_T is set by action a_{T-1}, for T> t_1.\n\nAt turn t_1=32, y_32 is given.\n\nThen a_32 sets y_33.\n\na_33 sets y_34, and so on.\n\na_{T-1} sets y_T.\n\nWe want y_K =9 for K = t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo y_K =9, which is set by action a_{K-1}.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which sets y_{t_1+1} to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\ny_{t_1 + H} is set by a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is set by a_{t_1 + H -2}.\n\nFor K = t_1 + H -1, y_K=9, set by a_{K-1} = a_{t_1 + H -2}.\n\nIn the action sequence, a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which includes a_{K-1} if K-1 >= t_1.\n\nSince K = t_1 + H -1, K-1 = t_1 + H -2.\n\na_{t_1 + H -2} is the action that sets y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nAnd a_{t_1 + H -1} sets y_{t_1 + H}, but we don't care after reaching.\n\nIn the sequence up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, we have H actions, and y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn my earlier sequence:\n\nAt turn 41, y=9.\n\nK=41.\n\nt_1=32, so K=32 + H -1 =41, so 32 + H -1 =41, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nAction sequence from a_{32} to a_{41}? a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{32} to a_{32+10-1} = a_{32} to a_{41}.\n\nBut in my sequence, I have actions up to a_{40}, which sets y_{41}=9.\n\na_{40} sets y_{41}, so for y_{41}=9, it is set by a_{40}.\n\nNow, a_{40} is the action at turn 40.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from a_{32} to a_{41}, but a_{41} would set y_{42}, which is beyond.\n\nFor H=10, actions a_{32} to a_{41}, but we only need up to a_{40} to reach y_{41}=9.\n\nLet's clarify the indices.\n\nSet t_1=32.\n\nWe need y_{32 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe actions are a_{32} to a_{32 + H -1}, which determine y_{33} to y_{32 + H}.\n\ny_{32 + H} is determined by a_{32 + H -1}.\n\nBut we want y_{32 + H -1} =9, which is determined by a_{32 + H -2}.\n\nSo for y_K=9 with K=32+H-1, it is determined by a_{K-1} = a_{32 + H -2}.\n\nIn the action sequence a_{32} to a_{32+H-1}, the last action a_{32+H-1} determines y_{32+H}, which may not be needed.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nIn terms of actions, to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, we need the actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2}, because a_{t_1 + H -2} sets y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nThen the sequence should be from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2}, for H-1 actions.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence has H actions, from t=0 to H-1 for the actions.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that the actions include up to the one that sets the position.\n\nStandard: at turn t_1, position given.\n\nAfter H actions (from t_1 to t_1+H-1), we have performed H actions, and the position at turn t_1 + H is set.\n\nBut we want position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nSo for turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9, it must be that after H-1 actions, we are at that position, but after k actions, we are at turn t_1 + k.\n\nAfter 0 actions, turn t_1, position y_{t_1}\n\nAfter 1 action, turn t_1+1, position y_{t_1+1}\n\nAfter m actions, turn t_1 + m, position y_{t_1 + m}\n\nWe want for some m, y_{t_1 + m} =9, and m should be H-1? Let's see.\n\nThe turn when we reach is T = t_1 + H -1, so y_T =9 with T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn T, after how many actions? Since we start at turn t_1 with no action yet, after k actions, we are at turn t_1 + k.\n\nSo at turn T, we have performed T - t_1 actions.\n\nFor turn T, actions performed: from a_{t_1} to a_{T-1}, because a_{T-1} sets y_T.\n\nNumber of actions: from t_1 to T-1, that's (T-1) - t_1 +1 = T - t_1 actions.\n\nThen T = t_1 + H -1, so number of actions = (t_1 + H -1) - t_1 = H-1.\n\nBut the sequence is specified as {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, which has H actions.\n\nFor H actions, we go up to turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want to reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo for that, with H actions, we reach at turn t_1 + H, but we want at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nTherefore, to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, we need only H-1 actions, but the sequence has H actions.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nPerhaps I misread.\n\nThe problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"after the sequence, at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9)\"\n\nBut with H actions, from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, these actions determine y_{t_1 +1} to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + H -1 is y_{t_1 + H -1}, which is determined by action a_{t_1 + H -2}, for H-1 >=1.\n\nFor turn t_1 + H -1, it is determined by a_{t_1 + H -2}.\n\nIn the sequence, a_{t_1 + H -2} is included if H-2 >=0.\n\nBut for the position at t_1 + H -1 to be 9, it depends on the actions before.\n\nIn the sequence up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, it includes a_{t_1 + H -1} which determines y_{t_1 + H}, not y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nSo to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, we don't need a_{t_1 + H -1}, only up to a_{t_1 + H -2}.\n\nBut the sequence is specified to have H actions, including up to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nFor example, in my sequence, to reach at turn 41, K=41, t_1=32, K=32 + H -1, so 41=32 + H -1, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen actions from a_{32} to a_{32+10-1} = a_{32} to a_{41}.\n\nBut a_{41} sets y_{42}, which is not needed, and we reached at turn 41 with a_{40} setting it.\n\nSo in the sequence for H=10, we have to include a_{41}, but it might be arbitrary, or we can set it to S or something, but since we already reached, it doesn't matter, but the position is at turn 41.\n\nThe collision is only checked up to when we are on the way, but once at y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nIn the sequence, for turns after reaching, if we include extra actions, but since we reach at turn t_1 + H -1, and actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which affects turn t_1 + H, but if at turn t_1 + H -1 we are at y=9, and we can stay or do something, but y=9 is safe, so no issue.\n\nIn this case, for my sequence, we reach at turn 41, so for H=10, actions from a_{32} to a_{41}.\n\nBut in my sequence, I have actions up to a_{40}, which is 9 actions, from a_{32} to a_{40}, setting y_{33} to y_{41}.\n\ny_{41}=9.\n\nThen for H=10, I need to include a_{41}, which can be S, for example, staying at y=9, but since we are already at y=9, it's fine.\n\nThe turn t_1 + H -1 =32+10-1=41, position (0,9), good.\n\nAnd a_{41} can be anything, say S.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nIn my earlier plan, I have two S at y=3, which might not be minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster.\n\nStart at t=32, y=2, safe.\n\nInstead of going up immediately, maybe go down or something, but that seems worse.\n\nOr at t=32, I could stay, but that delays.\n\na_32=U to y=3 at t=33.\n\nThen at t=33, y=3, instead of staying, I could go down to y=2, but y=2 is safe, but then I have to go up later, probably slower.\n\nOr, I could go directly to y=4, but at t=34 it is occupied.\n\nUnless I can be on y=4 at a different time.\n\nFor example, at t=33, if I go up to y=4 at t=34, but occupied.\n\nIf I stay at y=2 longer.\n\nBut y=2 is safe except at t=46-49, which are late, so no issue.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose at t=32, a_32=S, stay at y=2.\n\nThen at t=33, y=2, safe (not occupied until 46).\n\nThen a_33=U to y=3 at t=34.\n\nAt t=34, y=3, safe.\n\nThen a_34, if U to y=4 at t=35, but t=35 y=4 occupied.\n\nIf S at y=3, then a_35=U to y=4 at t=36, as before.\n\nSame as previous, but I delayed at y=2.\n\nWorse.\n\nAt t=32, U to y=3 at t=33.\n\nThen at t=33, instead of S, I could go down to y=2, but then at t=34, y=2, safe, but I need to go to y=3 later, so slower.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo the previous sequence seems reasonable, with two waits at y=3.\n\nBut in that sequence, I reached at t=41.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=4 earlier when it is safe.\n\nBut freeway 4 is safe only before t=33 or after t=35.\n\nBefore t=33: t=32, but at t=32, I am at y=2, not y=4.\n\nI can only be on y=4 from t=34 onwards if I move up.\n\nEarliest to be on y=4 is t=34, but occupied, or t=35 occupied, so t=36 is the earliest possible to be on y=4 safely.\n\nSimilarly, I could go to y=5 directly or something, but I have to go through each level.\n\nSince I can only change by ±1 or 0, I must go through intermediate y.\n\nFrom y=2, to y=3, then to y=4, etc.\n\nNo skipping.\n\nSo the earliest to be on y=4 is t=34 if I go up immediately, but occupied, so not possible.\n\nNext is t=35 if I go up at t=34, but occupied.\n\nThen t=36.\n\nSo yes, t=36 is earliest to be on y=4 safely.\n\nThen from there, I can go up each step to y=9 by t=41, as before.\n\nt=36 y=4, t=37 y=5, t=38 y=6, t=39 y=7, t=40 y=8, t=41 y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I go faster, but I have to wait for y=4 to be safe.\n\nNow, but y=5,6,7,8 are all safe after t=34, since occupied only at t=34.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=36, y=4, which is safe until t=42, but I leave quickly.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have two S actions: at t=33 and t=34, both at y=3.\n\nIn terms of actions:\n\nActions:\n\nt=32: a_32 = U  (to y=3)\n\nt=33: a_33 = S  (stay y=3)\n\nt=34: a_34 = S  (stay y=3)\n\nt=35: a_35 = U  (to y=4)\n\nt=36: a_36 = U  (to y=5)\n\nt=37: a_37 = U  (to y=6)\n\nt=38: a_38 = U  (to y=7)\n\nt=39: a_39 = U  (to y=8)\n\nt=40: a_40 = U  (to y=9)\n\nThen at turn 41, y=9.\n\nNow for H, t_1 + H -1 =41, 32 + H -1=41, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from a_32 to a_41? a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{41}.\n\nBut in this, I have actions up to a_40, which is 9 actions.\n\nFor H=10, I need 10 actions, including a_41.\n\na_41 can be S, for example, since at y=9.\n\nSo sequence: a_32 to a_41.\n\na_32: U\n\na_33: S\n\na_34: S\n\na_35: U\n\na_36: U\n\na_37: U\n\na_38: U\n\na_39: U\n\na_40: U\n\na_41: S  (or anything)\n\nBut a_41 sets y_42, which is at y=9, safe.\n\nNow, but at turn 41, we are already at y=9, so for the position at turn 41, it is set.\n\nIn the sequence, with a_41, we have an extra action, but it's fine.\n\nPerhaps H is defined such that we reach at turn t_1 + H -1 with H actions.\n\nIn this case, with 10 actions, we reach at turn 41.\n\nNow, can we do with less H?\n\nFor example, H=9.\n\nThen t_1 + H -1 =32 +9 -1=40.\n\nSo reach at turn 40, y=9.\n\nThen actions from a_32 to a_{32+9-1}=a_{40}.\n\nNow, y_{40} must be 9.\n\ny_{40} is set by a_{39}.\n\nNow, to have y_{40}=9, we need to be at y=9 at turn 40.\n\nWhich means that at turn 39, we must be at y=8, and a_{39}=U.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at turn 39, need to be at y=7 at turn 38 with a_{38}=U, and so on.\n\nSo we need to be at y=4 at some turn, and go up each step without delay.\n\nEarliest to be at y=4 safely is turn 36.\n\nThen from there:\n\nIf at turn 36, y=4\n\nThen a_{36}=U, turn 37 y=5\n\na_{37}=U, turn 38 y=6\n\na_{38}=U, turn 39 y=7\n\na_{39}=U, turn 40 y=8\n\nBut we need y=9 at turn 40, but here at turn 40 y=8.\n\nTo have y=9 at turn 40, we need to be at y=8 at turn 39 and a_{39}=U.\n\nBut at turn 39, y=7, a_{39}=U to y=8 at turn 40.\n\nSo at turn 40, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 40, we must have y_{39}=8 and a_{39}=U, so y_{40}=9.\n\nBut y_{39}=8 must be set by a_{38}, so at turn 38, y=7 or 8 or 9? a_{38} sets y_{39}.\n\nIf y_{39}=8, then a_{38} could be S if at y=8, or D from y=9, but we are going up, probably U from y=7.\n\nSimilarly, to have y_{39}=8, we need to be at y=8 at turn 38? Position at turn 38 is y_{38}, set by a_{37}.\n\nSet y_{39} by a_{38}.\n\ny_{39} = y_{38} + Δa_{38}\n\nWe want y_{39} =8.\n\nSimilarly, y_{40} = y_{39} + Δa_{39} =9.\n\nSince we want to minimize, probably we go up directly.\n\nSo assume we go up each time.\n\nThen to be at y=8 at turn 39, and y=9 at turn 40.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at turn 39, we need to have reached y=8 by turn 39.\n\nEarliest to be at y=4 is turn 36.\n\nThen:\n\nTurn 36: y=4\n\na_{36}=U, turn 37 y=5\n\na_{37}=U, turn 38 y=6\n\na_{38}=U, turn 39 y=7\n\nThen at turn 39, y=7, we can a_{39}=U to y=8 at turn 40.\n\nBut at turn 40, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y=9 at turn 40, we need y_{40}=9, so from above, at turn 40 y=8, we can a_{40}=U to y=9 at turn 41.\n\nBut for turn 40, we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nIf we want y_{40}=9, we must have y_{39}=8 and a_{39}=U, so y_{40}=9.\n\nBut y_{39}=8 requires that at turn 38, we are at y=7 or 8, and go to 8.\n\nIf at turn 38 y=7, a_{38}=U to y=8 at turn 39.\n\nThen a_{39}=U to y=9 at turn 40.\n\nBut we need to be at y=7 at turn 38.\n\nFrom y=4 at turn 36:\n\na_{36}=U, turn 37 y=5\n\na_{37}=U, turn 38 y=6\n\nAt turn 38 y=6, not 7.\n\na_{38}=U to y=7 at turn 39.\n\nThen y_{39}=7, a_{39}=U to y=8 at turn 40.\n\nStill y_{40}=8.\n\nTo have y_{39}=8, we need to be at y=8 earlier.\n\nBut earliest y=4 at 36, then to y=5 at 37, y=6 at 38, y=7 at 39, y=8 at 40.\n\nSo cannot have y=8 before turn 40? Turn 40 y=8.\n\ny=8 at turn 40.\n\nThen to have y=9 at turn 40, impossible, because we can only reach y=9 at turn 41 or later from here.\n\nIf we start earlier.\n\nBut we start at y=2 at turn 32.\n\nSuppose we go up faster.\n\nAt t=32, a_32=U, to y=3 at t=33.\n\nThen at t=33, if we could go to y=4, but cannot because at t=34 occupied.\n\nUnless we are at y=4 at t=36.\n\nBut from t=33 y=3, we have to stay or move.\n\nTo be at y=4 at t=36, we need to be at y=4 at turn 36.\n\nWhich means, at turn 35, we must be at y=3 or4 or5, and go to 4.\n\nProbably from y=3.\n\nSo at turn 35, y=3, a_35=U to y=4 at turn 36.\n\nAs before.\n\nIf at turn 35, we are at y=4, but how? If we were at y=4 earlier, but cannot because occupied.\n\nSo no, turn 36 is earliest for y=4.\n\nThus, cannot reach y=9 before turn 41.\n\nWith one less action, but we need to reach at turn 40 for H=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =40 for H=9.\n\ny_{40}=9.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at turn 40, we need to be at y=8 at turn 39 with a_{39}=U.\n\ny_{39}=8 must be set.\n\nEarliest to be at y=8: since y=4 at 36, y=5 at 37, y=6 at 38, y=7 at 39, y=8 at 40.\n\nSo at turn 39, we can be at y=7, and go to y=8 at turn 40.\n\nBut we need y_{39}=8 for a_{39}=U to y=9 at turn 40.\n\nBut y_{39}=8 requires that at turn 38, we are at y=8 or from y=7 with S or from y=9 with D, but not efficient.\n\nIf at turn 38, y=8, then a_{38}=S, y_{39}=8, then a_{39}=U, y_{40}=9.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at turn 38.\n\nHow? From y=4 at 36, to y=5 at 37, to y=6 at 38? a_{37}=U to y=6 at turn 38.\n\nThen at turn 38 y=6, a_{38}=U to y=7 at turn 39, not y=8.\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn 38, we need to have reached earlier.\n\nBut from start, to y=4 at 36, cannot reach y=8 by 38.\n\nFor example, if no delays, from y=2 at 32, a32=U to y=3 at 33, but then stuck, cannot go to y=4 until 36.\n\nAt t=33 y=3, if we go to y=4 at t=34, collision.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=4 before 36.\n\nThus, cannot be at y=8 before turn 40.\n\nTherefore, cannot reach y=9 at turn 40.\n\nEarliest at turn 41.\n\nThus H=10 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have two S actions, but perhaps I can reduce the waiting.\n\nAt y=3, I stayed for two turns: t=33 and t=34 both at y=3.\n\nBut freeway 3 is safe except at 46-49, so staying is fine, but I could have moved to another y, but y=2 or y=4, but y=4 not safe, y=2 is safe but lower.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nSo I think the sequence is fine.\n\nNow, but in freeway 4, there is another occupied period at t=42,43,44, but since I am at y=4 only at t=36, and I leave immediately, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways no problem.\n\nNow, about the cars: I think I covered all.\n\nIn the beginning, at t=32, y=2, no car, as we saw.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut in the answer, for H=10, actions from a_32 to a_41.\n\na_32: U\n\na_33: S\n\na_34: S\n\na_35: U\n\na_36: U\n\na_37: U\n\na_38: U\n\na_39: U\n\na_40: U\n\na_41: S  (since at y=9, stay)\n\nBut a_41 is not necessary for reaching, but for the sequence, it is included.\n\nTo be precise, the minimal H is 10.\n\nPerhaps I can have a_41 as U, but y=9, U would go to 10, but y=10 is invalid, since y in 0-9, so probably not allowed, or it caps.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if at y=9, U, it might stay or go to 9, but the rule says y in [0,9], so probably it saturates, but not specified.\n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\", so if y_t=9 and a_t=U, y_{t+1} = min(9, 9+1) or something? Not specified.\n\nIn the equation: Δy_t, and y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, but constrained to [0,9].\n\nSo if y_t=9 and U, y_{t+1} =10, but must be in [0,9], so probably set to 9.\n\nSimilarly for D at y=0.\n\nSo at y=9, U or S both keep at 9, D to 8.\n\nBut since we are at goal, S is fine.\n\nIn a_41, S.\n\nNow, in the sequence, let's list.\n\nAlso, for the cars, I think I have all.\n\nBut in freeway 4, at t=33,34,35 occupied, which we avoided.\n\nNow, the player path: at t=32, y=2; t=33, y=3; t=34, y=3; t=35, y=3; t=36, y=4; t=37, y=5; t=38, y=6; t=39, y=7; t=40, y=8; t=41, y=9.\n\nAll safe.\n\nAt t=36, y=4, freeway 4: at t=36, not occupied, as per times.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nH=10\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 32: a_{32} = U\n\nTurn 33: a_{33} = S\n\nTurn 34: a_{34} = S\n\nTurn 35: a_{35} = U\n\nTurn 36: a_{36} = U\n\nTurn 37: a_{37} = U\n\nTurn 38: a_{38} = U\n\nTurn 39: a_{39} = U\n\nTurn 40: a_{40} = U\n\nTurn 41: a_{41} = S\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut in the action, it should be for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=32.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: S\n\nTurn 34: S\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: S\n\nAnd that should be minimal.\n\nTo write in the format.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 4, there is a car at (32,21,right,4) at t=32, but I think I handled it, it never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nI think correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 32\\) is 10. This requires a sequence of 10 actions from \\(a_{32}\\) to \\(a_{41}\\), ensuring the player avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at each turn.\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed to wait at \\(y = 3\\) for two turns (turns 33 and 34) to avoid the occupied times on freeway \\(y = 4\\) (occupied at turns 33, 34, 35, 42, 43, 44). Freeway \\(y = 4\\) is first safe at turn 36. From turn 36 onwards, the player moves up consecutively to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 41.\n\n- At turn 32, the player is at \\(y = 2\\), which is safe (freeway 2 is occupied only at turns 46, 47, 48, 49).\n- Action \\(a_{32} = U\\) moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 33.\n- At turn 33, \\(y = 3\\) is safe (freeway 3 is occupied only at turns 46, 47, 48, 49). Action \\(a_{33} = S\\) keeps the player at \\(y = 3\\) for turn 34.\n- At turn 34, \\(y = 3\\) is still safe. Action \\(a_{34} = S\\) keeps the player at \\(y = 3\\) for turn 35.\n- At turn 35, \\(y = 3\\) is safe. Action \\(a_{35} = U\\) moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 36.\n- At turn 36, \\(y = 4\\) is safe (freeway 4 is not occupied at turn 36). Action \\(a_{36} = U\\) moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 37.\n- At turn 37, \\(y = 5\\) is safe (freeway 5 is occupied only at turn 34). Action \\(a_{37} = U\\) moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 38.\n- At turn 38, \\(y = 6\\) is safe (freeway 6 is occupied only at turn 34). Action \\(a_{38} = U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 39.\n- At turn 39, \\(y = 7\\) is safe (freeway 7 is occupied only at turn 34). Action \\(a_{39} = U\\) moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 40.\n- At turn 40, \\(y = 8\\) is safe (freeway 8 is occupied only at turn 34). Action \\(a_{40} = U\\) moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 41.\n- At turn 41, \\(y = 9\\) is reached, and since \\(y = 9\\) has no cars, it is always safe. Action \\(a_{41} = S\\) keeps the player at \\(y = 9\\), but this action is included to complete the sequence for \\(H = 10\\).\n\nThe position at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 32 + 10 - 1 = 41\\) is \\((0, 9)\\), as required.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 10\\) turns, as it is impossible to reach \\(y = 9\\) earlier (e.g., by turn 40) due to the occupation of freeway \\(y = 4\\) until turn 35, with the earliest safe entry at turn 36.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 32: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 39: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 40: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 41: \\, S \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and I start on y=3. Collision happens if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. Also, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that y until the next turn, so I only care about the car on the y I'm currently on for collision.\n\nFirst, I need to model where the cars are at each turn starting from t_1 = 34. Since the player moves at turn t, and the position updates after the action, so at turn t, I'm at y_t, and I choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1, and they move with constant speed.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t = 34.\n\nPlayer at (0,3).\n\nNow, for each freeway, the cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (-36, -47, right, 3). Since it's right-moving, head is at -47? No.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, it says head and tail, but in the update, for right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h]? Let's read carefully.\n\nIt says:\n\nFor car on freeway i, at turn t_1, head at h, tail at τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nThen for left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t_1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, at t_1, span is [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end, since it moves right, increasing.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving, h is left, τ is right, decreasing.\n\nIn the given, for freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3)\n\nSo head = -36, tail = -47? But for right-moving, span should be [tail, head] or [head, tail]? Confusion.\n\nFrom the update: for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h], and since it moves right, at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the notation, it says \"head at h, tail at τ\", but for right-moving, when direction is right, head should be the front when moving right, so if moving right, head is larger than tail, I think.\n\nIn freeway 1: head = -36, tail = -47, direction right. Since direction right, and tail = -47, head = -36, so tail is left, head is right, so span at t_1 is [tail, head] = [-47, -36], but -47 < -36, so [ -47, -36 ].\n\nThen for right-moving, span(T) = [ τ + sΔT, h + sΔT ] = [ -47 + 3ΔT, -36 + 3ΔT ]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ], so if h is head, and direction left, head is left, τ is right.\n\nBut in this case, all are right-moving except freeway 4 has multiple, but all seem right.\n\nFreeway 4 has three cars, all right.\n\nFreeway 5 to 8 have cars, all right.\n\nSo let's list for each freeway the cars at turn T.\n\nΔT = T - t_1 = T - 34.\n\nFor freeway 1: only one car: at t_1, head h = -36, tail τ = -47, d=right, s=3\n\nSo span at T: [ τ + sΔT, h + sΔT ] = [ -47 + 3(ΔT), -36 + 3(ΔT) ]\n\nCollision if 0 in this interval at turn T when I'm on y=1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-36, -47, right, 3) so same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-36, -47, right, 3)\n\nFreeway 4: three cars:\n\nFirst car: (-32, -43, right, 4) so at T, span: [ -43 + 4ΔT, -32 + 4ΔT ]\n\nSecond car: (4, -7, right, 4) head=4, tail=-7? Tail=-7, head=4, so span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-7, 4]\n\nAt T: [ -7 + 4ΔT, 4 + 4ΔT ]\n\nThird car: (40, 29, right, 4) head=40, tail=29, so span at t_1: [29,40], at T: [29 + 4ΔT, 40 + 4ΔT]\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars: (0, -11, right, 12) and (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head=0, tail=-11, d=right, s=12\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [ -11 + 12ΔT, 0 + 12ΔT ] = [ -11 + 12ΔT, 12ΔT ]\n\nSecond car: (48, 37, right, 12) head=48, tail=37, span at t_1: [37,48], at T: [37 + 12ΔT, 48 + 12ΔT]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5? (0, -11, right, 12) and (48, 37, right, 12) yes same.\n\nFreeway 7: same.\n\nFreeway 8: same.\n\nFreeways 5,6,7,8 all have identical cars: one car with span at T: [ -11 + 12ΔT, 12ΔT ] and another with [37 + 12ΔT, 48 + 12ΔT]\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 to y=9.\n\ny=3 at turn 34.\n\nI can move up, down, or stay each turn.\n\nI want to minimize H, the number of turns, so I should go up as much as possible, but I have to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's see the safe times for each freeway, when no car has 0 in span.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if for the freeway y that I am on at turn T, there is a car with 0 in its span at T.\n\nSince I move after the action, at turn T, I am at y_T, and I choose a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nWhen I am at position during turn T, I am on y_T, so I care about cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nIf I move to a different y at turn T, I am not on that new y until turn T+1.\n\nSo for collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the cars on that row at T.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, from y=3, I need to go up 6 steps. Minimum turns if I go up every time: 6 turns, but I might have to wait or go around if there are cars blocking.\n\nBut I can only move vertically, not horizontally, so I have to pass through each row, but I can stay or move down if needed, but that might increase H.\n\nSince I want minimal H, I should avoid moving down or staying unless necessary.\n\nStart at y=3, turn 34.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe rows I need to pass are y=4,5,6,7,8 to reach 9.\n\ny=9 is the target, no cars on y=9 or y=0, I think, since cars on y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nSo I start at y=3, which is freeway? y=3 has cars? Freeway k is the row, I think.\n\nFreeway k means row y=k.\n\nSo at row y=3, there are cars.\n\nAt turn 34, I am on y=3, so I need to check if at turn 34, for y=3, is there a car with 0 in span.\n\nFreeway 3: cars, one car with span at T=34: [ -47 + 3(0), -36 + 3(0) ] = [-47, -36], since ΔT=0.\n\n0 is not in [-47,-36], since -36 < 0? -36 is less than 0, so [-47,-36] is all negative, 0 not in it. So safe at turn 34 on y=3.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows, but I'm not on them yet.\n\nNow, I need to move to y=4, then 5, etc., up to 9.\n\nBut I can stay or move down if needed, but let's see the car positions over time.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nFor a given row, at turn T, unsafe if 0 is in some car's span on that row.\n\nThen I need to be on that row only at safe times.\n\nSince I move one step per turn, I can control when I arrive on each row.\n\nLet me define the time when I leave y=3. At turn 34, I am at y=3. I can choose to stay, move up to 4, or move down to 2, but since I need to go up, moving down might not help, and y=2 has cars too, but I don't want to go down.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is safe, but I start from 3, need to 9, so down to 0 might not be efficient.\n\nSo probably, I should go up directly.\n\nMinimal path is 6 moves up: actions U,U,U,U,U,U, from turn 34 to 39, y=3,4,5,6,7,8,9 at turn 40? Let's see the turns.\n\nAt turn 34, position y=3.\n\nAfter action a_{34}, at turn 35, y = y34 + a34, so if a34=U, y35=4.\n\nThen at turn 35, I am on y=4.\n\nThen a35=U, y36=5, and so on.\n\nSo to reach y=9, I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSuppose I do U at turn 34,35,36,37,38,39.\n\nThen y35=4, y36=5, y37=6, y38=7, y39=8, y40=9.\n\nSo at turn 40, y=9, which is the target. So H=6 turns, from t=34 to t=39 actions, position at t=40 is (0,9).\n\nNow, I need to check for each turn from 34 to 39, when I am on y=3,4,5,6,7,8 respectively, that no collision.\n\nAt turn 34: on y=3, as we saw, span [-47,-36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 35: on y=4.\n\nFreeway 4 has cars. At T=35, ΔT = T-34 =1.\n\nFirst car: [ -43 + 4(1), -32 + 4(1) ] = [ -43+4, -32+4] = [-39, -28]\n\nSecond car: [ -7 + 4(1), 4 + 4(1) ] = [-3, 8]\n\nThird car: [29 + 4(1), 40 + 4(1)] = [33,44]\n\nNow, is 0 in any? First: [-39,-28], all neg, no. Second: [-3,8], -3 to 8, 0 is in [-3,8]? -3 <= 0 <= 8, yes, 0 is included. So at turn 35, on y=4, there is a car with span [-3,8], which includes 0. So collision if I am on y=4 at turn 35.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=4 at turn 35.\n\nSo the direct path with U at turn 34 leads to collision at turn 35 on y=4.\n\nTherefore, I need to avoid that.\n\nI could stay at y=3 for some turns or move to other rows.\n\nBut let's see the safe times for each row.\n\nFirst, for row y=3: freeway 3, one car with span at T: [ -47 + 3ΔT, -36 + 3ΔT ]\n\nSet 0 in [ -47 + 3ΔT, -36 + 3ΔT ]\n\nSo -47 + 3ΔT <= 0 <= -36 + 3ΔT\n\nSince -36 + 3ΔT <= 0 or >=0? Let's solve inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: -47 + 3ΔT <= 0 => 3ΔT <= 47 => ΔT <= 47/3 ≈ 15.666, so ΔT <= 15\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -36 + 3ΔT => 3ΔT >= 36 => ΔT >= 12\n\nSo for ΔT between 12 and 15 inclusive, 0 in span.\n\nΔT = T - 34, so at T=34+12=46 to 34+15=49, y=3 is unsafe.\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nAt T=34, ΔT=0, -47 to -36, no 0, safe as before.\n\nNow row y=4: freeway 4, three cars.\n\nFirst car: [ -43 + 4ΔT, -32 + 4ΔT ]\n\n0 in this: -43 + 4ΔT <= 0 <= -32 + 4ΔT\n\nFirst: -43 + 4ΔT <= 0 => 4ΔT <= 43 => ΔT <= 10.75, so ΔT <= 10\n\nSecond: 0 <= -32 + 4ΔT => 4ΔT >= 32 => ΔT >= 8\n\nSo for ΔT=8 to 10, unsafe due to first car.\n\nSecond car: [ -7 + 4ΔT, 4 + 4ΔT ]\n\n0 in this: -7 + 4ΔT <= 0 <= 4 + 4ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -7 + 4ΔT <= 0 => 4ΔT <= 7 => ΔT <= 1.75, so ΔT <=1\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 4 + 4ΔT always true since 4+4ΔT >=4>0\n\nSo 0 <= -7 + 4ΔT? No, the condition is left <=0<= right, so -7 + 4ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= 4 + 4ΔT\n\n0 <= 4 + 4ΔT is always true for ΔT >=0.\n\n-7 + 4ΔT <= 0 implies ΔT <= 7/4 = 1.75, so ΔT <=1 since integer, I assume turns are integers.\n\nΔT integer.\n\nSo for ΔT <=1, unsafe if -7+4ΔT <=0, which is for ΔT=0,1.\n\nAt ΔT=0: -7+0= -7 <=0, 4+0=4>=0, 0 in [-7,4]? -7 <=0<=4, yes.\n\nΔT=1: -7+4=-3 <=0, 4+4=8>=0, 0 in [-3,8], yes.\n\nΔT=2: -7+8=1, 4+8=12, span [1,12], 0 not in, since 1>0.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=0,1 unsafe for second car.\n\nThird car: [29 + 4ΔT, 40 + 4ΔT], both positive, min 29>0, so 0 not in, always safe.\n\nSo for y=4, unsafe when second car has 0 in span, i.e., ΔT=0 or 1, or when first car has it, ΔT=8,9,10.\n\nΔT=0: unsafe due to second car\n\nΔT=1: unsafe due to second car\n\nΔT=8: unsafe due to first car? ΔT=8: first car span: -43+32= -11, -32+32=0? [ -43+4*8, -32+4*8] = [-43+32, -32+32] = [-11,0]\n\n-11 <=0<=0, yes, 0 included.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=9: [-43+36, -32+36] = [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nΔT=10: [-43+40, -32+40] = [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nΔT=11: [-43+44, -32+44] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe for ΔT=0,1 (from second car) and ΔT=8,9,10 (from first car).\n\nSafe for other ΔT.\n\nNow row y=5: freeway 5, two cars.\n\nFirst car: [ -11 + 12ΔT, 0 + 12ΔT ] = [ -11 + 12ΔT, 12ΔT ]\n\n0 in this: since left is -11+12ΔT, right is 12ΔT.\n\n-11+12ΔT <= 0 <= 12ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -11+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=11 => ΔT <= 11/12 <1, so for ΔT=0, -11<=0<=0? At ΔT=0, span [-11,0], -11<=0<=0, yes, 0 included.\n\nAt ΔT=1, [ -11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 12ΔT, always true for ΔT >=0.\n\nSo for first car, unsafe only at ΔT=0.\n\nAt ΔT=0, [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nAt ΔT=1, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nNow second car: [37 + 12ΔT, 48 + 12ΔT], min 37>0, so 0 never in, always safe.\n\nSo for y=5, unsafe only at ΔT=0, due to first car.\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nSimilarly, for y=6, same as y=5, since cars identical. Freeway 6 has same cars, so unsafe only at ΔT=0.\n\ny=7, same, unsafe only at ΔT=0.\n\ny=8, same, unsafe only at ΔT=0.\n\nNow y=1: freeway 1, one car: [ -47 + 3ΔT, -36 + 3ΔT ]\n\n0 in this: -47 + 3ΔT <= 0 <= -36 + 3ΔT\n\nAs before, ΔT >=12 and ΔT <=15, so T=46 to 49 unsafe.\n\nOther times safe.\n\ny=2: freeway 2, same as y=1, unsafe at T=46 to 49.\n\ny=3: same, unsafe at T=46 to 49.\n\nNow back to me. I start at turn 34, y=3.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, always safe, but I need to be on it.\n\nThe critical part is to pass through the middle rows without being there at unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically, since y=5,6,7,8 are only unsafe at exactly ΔT=0, which is turn 34.\n\nAt turn 34, if I am on y=5,6,7,8, it would be unsafe, but I start on y=3, so at turn 34, I am on y=3, which is safe at that time.\n\nThen for y=4, unsafe at ΔT=0,1,8,9,10.\n\nΔT=0: turn 34\n\nΔT=1: turn 35\n\nΔT=8: turn 34+8=42\n\nΔT=9:43\n\nΔT=10:44\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 to y=9.\n\nPossible paths: I can go directly up, but need to avoid being on y=4 at unsafe times.\n\nSince y=5,6,7,8 are safe except at turn 34, which I can avoid by not being there at turn 34.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 is safe except at turns 46-49, which are far, so I can leave early.\n\nTo minimize H, I should go up as soon as possible.\n\nBut at turn 34, if I go up to y=4, I arrive at turn 35 on y=4.\n\nBut turn 35 is ΔT=1, which is unsafe for y=4.\n\nIf I stay at y=3 at turn 34, then at turn 35, I am still on y=3, which is safe, since unsafe only later.\n\nThen I can move later.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nLet me think about the sequence.\n\nI need to be on each row at some safe time.\n\nStart at turn 34 on y=3.\n\nI need to go to y=4, then to y=5, etc.\n\nBut I can stay multiple turns or skip, but since I move one step, I have to visit each intermediate row, but I can stay or move faster, but to go up, I must pass through y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nThe time I spend on each row can be multiple turns if I stay, but that increases H.\n\nH is the number of actions, so each action takes one turn, and position changes after action.\n\nThe turn when I first arrive at a row.\n\nLet me define the arrival time.\n\nAt turn 34, I am on y=3.\n\nIf I take action at turn 34, I move to y_{35} = y_34 + a_34.\n\nThen at turn 35, I am on y_35.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo be on y=4 for the first time, I need to move up from y=3 at some turn.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut I can also go down, but that might not help.\n\nSince y=5 to 8 are only unsafe at turn 34, and I start before, I can go to them after turn 34.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 is unsafe at turn 34,35,42,43,44.\n\nTurn 34 and 35 are early, 42-44 later.\n\nI should go up as soon as possible, but avoid the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, to reach y=4, I need to be on it at a safe time.\n\nSafe times for y=4: all except ΔT=0,1,8,9,10, so except turn 34,35,42,43,44.\n\nSo safe at turn 36,37,38,39,40,41,45, etc.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5, safe at all times except turn 34 (ΔT=0).\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8.\n\ny=9 always safe.\n\nNow, I am at y=3 at turn 34.\n\nI can choose to move up at turn 34 or later.\n\nIf I move up at turn 34, I go to y=4 at turn 35, but turn 35 is unsafe for y=4.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf I stay at y=3 at turn 34: action S, then at turn 35, I am still on y=3.\n\ny=3 is safe at turn 35, since unsafe only at 46-49.\n\nThen at turn 35, I can move up to y=4.\n\nBut turn 35 is unsafe for y=4, so if I go to y=4 at turn 35, I am on y=4 at turn 35, unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nI could stay at y=3 for multiple turns.\n\nFor example, stay at y=3 until a safe time to go to y=4.\n\nBut y=4 is safe from turn 36 onwards except 42-44.\n\nTurn 36 is safe for y=4? ΔT=2 for turn 36? T=36, ΔT=36-34=2.\n\ny=4 safe at ΔT=2: earlier, for ΔT=2, second car span [ -7+8,4+8]=[1,12], 0 not in, first car at ΔT=2: [-43+8,-32+8]=[-35,-24], no 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=3: second car [ -7+12,4+12]=[5,16], no; first car [-43+12,-32+12]=[-31,-20], no.\n\nUp to ΔT=7: T=41, safe.\n\nΔT=8: T=42, unsafe.\n\nSo y=4 safe at T=36,37,38,39,40,41 (ΔT=2 to 7), then unsafe 42,43,44, then safe again.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 safe except T=34.\n\nSince I need to go through y=4 to y=5, etc.\n\nI am at y=3 at T=34.\n\nOption: stay at y=3 for one turn: at T=34, action S, then at T=35, still y=3.\n\nThen at T=35, I can move up to y=4? But at T=35, if I go to y=4, I arrive at T=35 on y=4, but T=35 is unsafe for y=4.\n\nNot possible.\n\nI could stay at y=3 longer.\n\nFor example, at T=34, S, then at T=35, still y=3.\n\nAt T=35, instead of moving up, I could stay again or move down, but move down not helpful.\n\nOr stay: at T=35, S, then at T=36, y=3.\n\nNow at T=36, I can move up to y=4.\n\nT=36, ΔT=2 for y=4, which is safe as above.\n\nSo at T=36, action U, then at T=37, I am on y=4 (since y_{37} = y_36 + a_36, but y_36=3, a_36=U, so y_37=4).\n\nAt turn T=37, position y=4, which is safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go up to y=5.\n\ny=5 is safe except at T=34.\n\nAt T=37, ΔT=3, safe.\n\nSo I can go U at T=37 to y=5 at T=38.\n\nSimilarly, y=6,7,8 all safe at T=38,39,40, etc., since only unsafe at T=34.\n\nThen to y=9.\n\nLet's list the actions.\n\nTurn 34: start at y=3. I need to take action a_{34}.\n\nIf I take S at turn 34: then at turn 35, y=3.\n\nThen at turn 35, take S again? Or U.\n\nIf at turn 35, I take U, then y_{36} = y_{35} + U = 3 + 1 =4, so at turn 36, on y=4.\n\nBut turn 36 is safe for y=4 as above.\n\nThen at turn 36, I am on y=4, I can take action U to go to y=5 at turn 37.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 34: since at turn 34 I am on y=3, and I take action. If I take S, I stay at y=3 for turn 35.\n\nThen turn 35: I can take U, so y_{36} = y_{35} + U = 3 + 1 =4, so at turn 36, on y=4.\n\nNow, at turn 36, I am on y=4, safe.\n\nThen I take action at turn 36, say U, so y_{37} = 4 + 1 =5, at turn 37 on y=5.\n\ny=5 safe at T=37.\n\nThen turn 37: U, y_{38} =5+1=6, turn 38 on y=6.\n\nSafe.\n\nTurn 38: U, y_{39} =6+1=7, turn 39 on y=7.\n\nSafe.\n\nTurn 39: U, y_{40} =7+1=8, turn 40 on y=8.\n\ny=8 safe except T=34, so at T=40 safe.\n\nThen turn 40: U, y_{41} =8+1=9, turn 41 on y=9, done.\n\nNow, H is the number of turns from t=34 to t=40, that's 7 actions: turns 34 to 40.\n\nActions at turn 34,35,36,37,38,39,40.\n\nPosition at turn 41 is y=9.\n\nH=7 turns.\n\nBut earlier I thought min 6, but with collision, so 7 might be minimal now.\n\nCan I do better?\n\nFor example, if I go up at a later time but not wait two turns.\n\nAt turn 34, if I take U, I go to y=4 at turn 35, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nTake S at turn 34, then at turn 35, I am on y=3.\n\nThen at turn 35, instead of U, I take S again, then at turn 36, still y=3.\n\nThen at turn 36, U to y=4 at turn 37.\n\nThen from y=4 at turn 37, U to y=5 at 38, etc., to y=9 at turn 42? Let's see: start turn 34 S, y35=3; turn 35 S, y36=3; turn 36 U, y37=4; turn 37 U, y38=5; turn 38 U, y39=6; turn 39 U, y40=7; turn 40 U, y41=8; turn 41 U, y42=9. So H=9, worse than 7.\n\nNot better.\n\nAfter reaching y=4 at turn 36, I go up each turn to y=9 at turn 41, with 7 actions.\n\nBut can I reach faster?\n\nWhat if I go to y=4 earlier? But turn 34 and 35 unsafe, turn 36 is earliest safe for y=4 after start.\n\nTurn 36 is ΔT=2, safe.\n\nBut is there a way to be on y=4 at turn 34 or 35? No, because unsafe.\n\nUnless I am not on it at that time, but I have to pass through.\n\nPerhaps I can go to other rows, but I need to go up.\n\nSince y=5 is safe after turn 34, but to reach y=5, I need to be on y=4 first.\n\nUnless I start from y=3 and go directly, but I move one step at a time.\n\nAnother idea: I could move down to y=2 or something, but y=2 might be safe, but then I have to come back, which takes more turns.\n\nFor example, at turn 34, instead of S or U, I take D to y=2 at turn 35.\n\nThen at turn 35, on y=2.\n\ny=2 at turn 35: freeway 2, cars same as y=1, span at T=35, ΔT=1, [ -47 +3(1), -36+3(1) ] = [-44,-33], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at turn 35, I can go up to y=3 or to y=1 or stay.\n\nBut I need to go up to 9.\n\nIf I go to y=3 at turn 36, then same as before.\n\nOr from y=2, I could go down to y=1, but y=1 at some time might be unsafe, but at turn 35, y=1: ΔT=1, [ -47+3, -36+3] = [-44,-33], 0 not in, safe.\n\nBut then I am going down, not efficient.\n\nFor example, turn 34: D, to y=2 at turn 35.\n\nTurn 35: D, to y=1 at turn 36.\n\nThen turn 36: U, to y=2 at turn 37? Messy.\n\nNot better than going directly up with waiting.\n\nSo the sequence with 7 turns seems reasonable.\n\nBut in the sequence I had: actions from turn 34 to 40.\n\nAt turn 34: S (stay at y=3)\n\nTurn 35: U? In my first sequence: turn 34 S, y35=3\n\nThen turn 35: U, so y36=4 (since from y=3, up to 4)\n\ny36=4 at turn 36.\n\nThen turn 36: U, y37=5\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 40: U, y41=9\n\nActions: turn 34: S, turn 35: U, turn 36: U, turn 37: U, turn 38: U, turn 39: U, turn 40: U\n\nThat's 7 actions, from turn 34 to 40.\n\nH=7.\n\nBut at turn 40, I take U to go to y=9 at turn 41.\n\nThe position is reached at turn 41.\n\nBut H is the number of actions, I think.\n\nThe problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t_1, position is given, after action a_{t_1}, position at turn t_1 +1.\n\nAfter H actions, position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1.\n\nSet t_1=34.\n\nAfter actions a_{34} to a_{34+H-1}, position at turn 34+H is y=9.\n\nIn my sequence: if H=7, actions a34 to a40, position at turn 41=34+7=41, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nCan I do with H=6?\n\nThat would mean actions a34 to a39, position at turn 40=34+6=40? Turn 34+H =34+6=40.\n\ny at turn 40 should be 9.\n\nBut from start y3 at turn 34.\n\nAfter 6 actions, if all U, y at turn 40 would be 3+6=9, yes.\n\nBut we need to be safe at each turn when on a row with cars.\n\nFor H=6, actions from turn 34 to 39, positions: at turn 34: y=3, safe.\n\nThen a34: if U, y35=4, but at turn 35 on y=4, which is unsafe as we saw.\n\nIf a34=S, y35=3, then at turn 35 on y=3, safe.\n\nThen a35: if U, y36=4, at turn 36 on y=4, which is safe as before.\n\nBut then I need to go to y=9 in the remaining actions.\n\nAfter a35=U, at turn 36 on y=4.\n\nThen I need to go up 5 more steps to y=9.\n\nWith actions a36 to a39, that's 4 actions, but I need 5 steps: from y=4 to y=9 is 5 moves.\n\nActions a36,a37,a38,a39: 4 actions, to positions turn 37,38,39,40.\n\ny37: after a36, from y4, if U, y37=5\n\ny38=6, y39=7, y40=8, not 9.\n\nMissing one step.\n\nWith H=6 actions, I can reach at most y=3+6=9 at turn 40.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at turn 40, I need to be at y=8 at turn 39, and take U.\n\nBut in the sequence, if I start at y3 turn34.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn40, I need y40=9.\n\ny40 is after action at turn39.\n\nSo at turn39, I am at y39, and take a39 such that y40 = y39 + a39 =9.\n\nSo y39 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y39=8, a39=U to y40=9.\n\nIf y39=9, a39=S or something, but better to U if possible, but if already 9, S.\n\nBut we need to reach 9.\n\nSimilarly, at turn38, position y38, and so on.\n\nFor H=6, actions a34 to a39, positions:\n\nTurn34: y34=3\n\nAfter a34: y35 = y34 + Δy34\n\nTurn35: position y35\n\nAfter a35: y36\n\n...\n\nAfter a39: y40\n\nWe want y40=9.\n\nAlso, for each turn t from 34 to 39, when on y_t between 1 and 8, no collision.\n\ny_t at turn t must be safe.\n\nNow, to reach y40=9, since y40 = y39 + Δy39, so y39 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y39=8, then a39=U to y40=9.\n\nIf y39=9, a39=S to stay, but we can do U to move, but not necessary.\n\nBut since we want minimal, probably move if not at 9.\n\nBut y39=9 only if we reached earlier, but we start at 3, so y39=9 means we reached at turn39 or before, but at turn34 we are at3, so to be at9 at turn39, we need to have moved up in between.\n\nBut let's see possible.\n\ny40=9, so the position at turn40 is9.\n\nNow, at turn39, y39 must be such that y39 + Δy39 =9, so y39=8 or9.\n\nSimilarly, at turn38, y38, etc.\n\nTo minimize time, we should go up as much as possible.\n\nSuppose we use all U actions except where we need to wait.\n\nBut with H=6, from y3 to y9 in 6 moves, so net +6 in y, so all U or some U and S, but S doesn't help, so all U.\n\nSo actions: a34 to a39 all U.\n\nThen y35=4, y36=5, y37=6, y38=7, y39=8, y40=9.\n\nNow check collisions:\n\nTurn34: y34=3, safe as before.\n\nTurn35: y35=4, at T=35, which is unsafe for y=4, as we saw, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf I start with S at turn34, then y35=3.\n\nThen at turn35, if I take U, y36=4.\n\nThen turn36: y36=4, safe if T=36.\n\nThen a36=U, y37=5\n\na37=U, y38=6\n\na38=U, y39=7\n\na39=U, y40=8, not 9.\n\ny40=8, but we need y40=9.\n\nWith H=6 actions, after a39, y40=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y40=9, I need to be at y39=8 and a39=U.\n\nBut in this case, with actions from 34 to39, I have only 6 actions, but from turn34 start at y3.\n\nAfter a34: if S, y35=3\n\na35: U, y36=4\n\na36: U, y37=5\n\na37: U, y38=6\n\na38: U, y39=7\n\na39: U, y40=8\n\ny40=8, not 9.\n\nIf a34=U, but we can't because collision at turn35.\n\na34=D, then y35=2, then a35=U, y36=3, etc., worse.\n\nSo with H=6, I can at best reach y=8 at turn40, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn40, I need to have taken 6 up moves, but from turn34 to39, that's 6 actions, each U would increase y by 1, from y34=3 to y40=9, but only if all U and no down.\n\nBut in the sequence, if all U, y35=4, y36=5, ..., y40=9.\n\nBut y35=4 at turn35 unsafe.\n\nIf I start with S, y35=3, then y36=4, y37=5, y38=6, y39=7, y40=8.\n\nNot 9.\n\nTo have y40=9, I must have y39=8 and a39=U.\n\ny39=8 must be reached by turn39.\n\nBut from start, with actions a34 to a38, I can reach y39.\n\nFor example, a34=U, but cannot.\n\na34=S, y35=3; a35=U, y36=4; a36=U, y37=5; a37=U, y38=6; a38=U, y39=7; then a39=U, y40=8.\n\nStill y39=7, y40=8.\n\nTo reach y39=8, I need to have taken one more U earlier.\n\nBut at turn34, if I take U, collision.\n\nPerhaps move faster, but I can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 in 6 actions from y=3 at turn34.\n\nMinimal actions: from y=3 to y=9, need 6 moves up, so at least 6 actions if I go directly.\n\nBut since I have to avoid, I need to spend some turns staying or moving down, which increases actions.\n\nIn my earlier sequence with H=7, I have one S and six U? Turn34: S, turn35: U, turn36: U, turn37: U, turn38: U, turn39: U, turn40: U.\n\nThat's one S and six U, from y3 to y4 in two turns? Start turn34 y3, after S, turn35 y3; then U to y4 at turn36; then U to y5 at37, etc., to y9 at turn41.\n\ny at turn36:4, turn37:5, turn38:6, turn39:7, turn40:8, turn41:9.\n\nBut with H=7 actions, up to turn40, y41=9.\n\nThe number of moves: from y3 to y9, delta y=6, so minimal actions if no waiting is 6, but with waiting, more.\n\nHere I waited one turn at y3, so 7 actions.\n\nCan I wait less? For example, if I can go to y=4 at a safe time without waiting two turns, but turn34 and35 unsafe, next safe is turn36.\n\nSo I must wait at least one turn? At turn34, if I take no action? I have to take action.\n\nAt turn34, I can take D to y=2, but that might not help.\n\nFor example, turn34: D, to y=2 at turn35.\n\nTurn35: U, to y=3 at turn36? y35=2 (after D from y3), then a35=U, y36=3.\n\nThen at turn36, on y=3, safe.\n\nThen I can go up from there.\n\nBut now at turn36, y=3, I take U to y=4 at turn37.\n\nThen same as before, but I started with D and U, which took two turns to go from y3 to y3, no progress.\n\nThen to y4 at turn37, later than before.\n\nWorse.\n\nFrom y=2 at turn35, I could go up to y=3 at turn36, same as above.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo the sequence with S at turn34 and then U all the way seems best.\n\nBut in that sequence, I reach y=9 at turn41 with 7 actions.\n\nBut let me confirm all safe.\n\nTurn34: action a34=S, position at turn34: after action? At turn t, position is y_t before action? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, player is at position (0, y_t).\n\nThen player chooses action a_t.\n\nThen position updates: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, player is at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nCollision is checked at turn t based on y_t and the cars at that turn.\n\nIn the collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nSo at turn T, we have y_T, and we check cars on row y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, in the sequence:\n\nAt turn 34: y34 = 3, cars on y=3: span at T=34, ΔT=0, [-47,-36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction a34 = S, so y35 = y34 + 0 = 3.\n\nAt turn 35: y35 = 3, cars on y=3: at T=35, ΔT=1, span [ -47+3, -36+3] = [-44,-33], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction a35 = U, so y36 = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nAt turn 36: y36 = 4, cars on y=4: at T=36, ΔT=2.\n\nFirst car: [ -43 + 4*2, -32 + 4*2] = [-43+8, -32+8] = [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [ -7 + 4*2, 4 + 4*2] = [-7+8, 4+8] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [29+8,40+8]=[37,48], no.\n\nSafe.\n\nAction a36 = U, so y37 = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nAt turn 37: y37 = 5, cars on y=5: at T=37, ΔT=3.\n\nFirst car: [ -11 + 12*3, 0 + 12*3] = [-11+36, 36] = [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [37+36,48+36]=[73,84], no.\n\nSafe.\n\nAction a37 = U, so y38 = 5 + 1 = 6.\n\nAt turn 38: y38 = 6, cars on y=6: similar to y=5, at ΔT=4, [ -11 + 48, 48] = [37,48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction a38 = U, y39 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nTurn 39: y39 = 7, safe similarly, ΔT=5, [ -11 + 60, 60] = [49,60], no 0.\n\nAction a39 = U, y40 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nTurn 40: y40 = 8, cars on y=8: at T=40, ΔT=6.\n\nFirst car: [ -11 + 12*6, 12*6] = [-11+72, 72] = [61,72], no 0.\n\nSecond car: [37+72,48+72]=[109,120], no.\n\nSafe.\n\nAction a40 = U, so y41 = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nAt turn 41: y41=9, no cars, safe, but we don't care, since we reached.\n\nBut the target is to reach (0,9), which is at turn 41.\n\nWith actions from turn 34 to 40, 7 actions.\n\nH=7.\n\nIn the answer, we need the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 40, we take action to go to y=9.\n\nBut we are done when we reach y=9.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=6?\n\nSuppose I go to y=4 at a different time.\n\nFor example, at turn 34, I stay, but then at turn 35, I go up to y=4, but turn 35 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=4 at turn 36, as before.\n\nBut then to reach y=9 at turn 40, I need to go from y=4 to y=9 in 4 actions, which is 4 steps, but from y=4 to y=9 is 5 steps, so impossible in 4 moves.\n\ny from turn 36: at turn 36, if I am on y=4.\n\nThen after action at turn 36, y37, etc.\n\nTo have y40=9, I need y40 = y39 + Δy39 =9.\n\nSo with actions at turn 36,37,38,39.\n\nFour actions to change from y=4 to y=9, which requires +5, but each action changes y by at most 1, so maximum y increase is 4, to y=8, or less.\n\nCannot reach y=9 from y=4 in four actions.\n\nMinimal actions to go from y=a to y=b is |b-a|, if no obstacles.\n\nWith obstacles, may need more.\n\nHere from y=4 to y=9, need 5 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, if I start from y=4 at turn 36, then with actions turn 36 to 40, I can reach y=9 at turn 41.\n\nBut that requires being at y=4 at turn 36.\n\nIn that case, with earlier actions: to be at y=4 at turn 36.\n\nI am at y=3 at turn 34.\n\nAt turn 34, I can take S, to be at y=3 turn 35.\n\nThen at turn 35, take U, to be at y=4 turn 36.\n\nAs before.\n\nIf at turn 34 I take U, I am at y=4 turn 35, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo no, H=6 impossible.\n\nThus minimal H=7.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have actions: turn 34: S, turn 35: U, turn 36: U, turn 37: U, turn 38: U, turn 39: U, turn 40: U.\n\nBut turn 40 action is to go to y=9.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be for turns starting from t1=34.\n\nNow, the car on y=4 at later times, but in this sequence, I am on y=4 only at turn 36, which is safe, and others fine.\n\nBut freeway 4 has unsafe times at 42-44, but I am there at 36, early, so ok.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought about y=1,2,3 unsafe at 46-49, but I am not there at that time.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster by not staying at the beginning.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=2 or something, but that takes extra turns.\n\nSuppose at turn 34, I take D, to y=2 at turn 35.\n\nThen at turn 35, on y=2, safe.\n\nThen at turn 35, I take U, to y=3 at turn 36.\n\nThen at turn 36, on y=3, safe.\n\nThen at turn 36, I take U to y=4 at turn 37.\n\nThen same as before, but I reached y=4 at turn 37, later than turn 36, so I need one more turn to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, y37=4, then U to y5 at38, y6 at39, y7 at40, y8 at41, then need another action to y9 at42. H=8 or 9, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo the sequence with one stay at start is best.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=7.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 34: S\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nNow, in the answer format, it should be written as:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 34: S \\\\ Turn 35: U \\\\ Turn 36: U \\\\ Turn 37: U \\\\ Turn 38: U \\\\ Turn 39: U \\\\ Turn 40: U }\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbers.\n\nt1=34, actions from t=34 to t=40.\n\nIn the sequence, for t from 0 to H-1, but in the box, it should list each turn.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 4 has multiple cars, but we handled.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 35, I am on y=3, which is freeway 3, and at that time, span [-44,-33], no 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nI think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 34\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Positions and Safe Times\nThe cars on each freeway move at constant speeds, and their spans at any turn \\(T\\) are calculated relative to \\(t_1 = 34\\) (i.e., \\(\\Delta T = T - 34\\)). A collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) if the player is on freeway \\(y_T\\) and 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\). The safe times for each relevant freeway are:\n\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Unsafe at turns 46 to 49 (inclusive). Safe at all other times, including turns 34 and 35.\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Unsafe at turns 34, 35, 42, 43, and 44. Safe at all other times, including turns 36 to 41.\n- **Freeways 5-8 (y=5 to y=8)**: Unsafe only at turn 34. Safe at all other times, including turns 35 to 41.\n- **Freeway 9 (y=9)**: No cars, always safe.\n\nThe initial position at turn 34 is (0, 3), which is safe since freeway 3 is safe at turn 34. However, moving directly upward leads to a collision:\n- If \\(a_{34} = U\\), the player moves to y=4 at turn 35, but freeway 4 is unsafe at turn 35 (0 ∈ [-3, 8] for a car on y=4).\n- Thus, a direct upward path in 6 turns is impossible due to the unsafe state at turn 35.\n\nTo avoid this, the player must wait at y=3 for one turn before moving upward. The earliest safe time to be on y=4 is turn 36. From y=4 at turn 36, moving upward each turn allows the player to reach y=9 by turn 41 with no collisions, as all intermediate freeways are safe at the respective turns.\n\n### Minimal Sequence of Actions\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H = 7\\), with actions from turn 34 to turn 40, reaching (0, 9) at turn 41. The sequence is:\n- Turn 34: Stay (S) at y=3 (safe, no collision).\n- Turn 35: Move up (U) to y=4 at turn 36 (y=3 is safe at turn 35).\n- Turn 36: Move up (U) to y=5 at turn 37 (y=4 is safe at turn 36).\n- Turn 37: Move up (U) to y=6 at turn 38 (y=5 is safe at turn 37).\n- Turn 38: Move up (U) to y=7 at turn 39 (y=6 is safe at turn 38).\n- Turn 39: Move up (U) to y=8 at turn 40 (y=7 is safe at turn 39).\n- Turn 40: Move up (U) to y=9 at turn 41 (y=8 is safe at turn 40).\n\nThis sequence avoids all unsafe times:\n- Turn 34: y=3, safe (span [-47, -36], 0 ∉ span).\n- Turn 35: y=3, safe (span [-44, -33], 0 ∉ span).\n- Turn 36: y=4, safe (spans [-35, -24], [1, 12], [37, 48], 0 ∉ any span).\n- Turn 37: y=5, safe (spans [25, 36], [73, 84], 0 ∉ any span).\n- Turn 38: y=6, safe (spans [37, 48], [85, 96], 0 ∉ any span).\n- Turn 39: y=7, safe (spans [49, 60], [97, 108], 0 ∉ any span).\n- Turn 40: y=8, safe (spans [61, 72], [109, 120], 0 ∉ any span).\n\nNo sequence with \\(H < 7\\) is possible, as:\n- \\(H = 6\\) would require reaching y=9 by turn 40, but from y=3 at turn 34, this requires 6 upward moves. However, the first upward move at turn 34 leads to y=4 at turn 35, which is unsafe. Waiting or moving down increases the turn count beyond 6.\n\nThus, \\(H = 7\\) is minimal.\n\n### Answer\n\\boxed{ Turn 34: S \\\\ Turn 35: U \\\\ Turn 36: U \\\\ Turn 37: U \\\\ Turn 38: U \\\\ Turn 39: U \\\\ Turn 40: U }",

The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway at a turn where a car's span includes x=0 at that turn. When I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I only check for collision on the freeway I'm currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1 = 36. Player at (0,4).\n\nI need to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, since I need to go up to y=9 from y=4, I need to move up at least 5 times. But I might need to move down or stay to avoid cars, so H could be more than 5.\n\nNow, let's look at the car positions at turn t=36.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to know where the cars are at turn 36 and how they move over time.\n\nThe car update: for a car, at turn T, span is [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)] for left-moving? Let's read carefully.\n\nIt says:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut in the notation, for left-moving, it has Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and since it's left-moving, h should be the head, which is decreasing? I think there might be inconsistency in head and tail.\n\nFor left-moving: head h, tail τ, and since it's moving left, both decrease over time.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: head h, tail τ, moving right, both increase.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-30, -41, right, 3)\n\nBut -30 and -41, with right direction and speed 3.\n\nIf it's right-moving, and head is -30, tail is -41? That seems odd because -30 > -41, so if it's moving right, head should be greater than tail? Let's see the span definition.\n\nFor right-moving: it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the initial state, it's given as (head h, tail τ), but for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] which suggests that τ is the left end and h is the right end, so head is the front, tail is the back.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if moving left, h is the left end, τ is the right end? But typically head is the front.\n\nI think I need to interpret based on direction.\n\nLet's clarify from the text.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" and it moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so τ is the left end, h is the right end. So in the tuple (h, τ, d, s), for right-moving, h is the head (right end), τ is the tail (left end).\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so h is the head (left end), τ is the tail (right end).\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (-30, -41, right, 3)\n\nSince right-moving, head h is the right end, so at t1=36, the car spans from τ to h, which is from -41 to -30.\n\nSimilarly, for all, let's list the spans at t=36 for each freeway.\n\nFreeway k=1: right-moving, head h=-30, tail τ=-41, so span [τ, h] = [-41, -30] at t=36. Speed 3.\n\nFreeway k=2: same as k=1, (-30, -41, right, 3), so span [-41, -30]\n\nFreeway k=3: same, [-41, -30]\n\nFreeway k=4: three cars: (-24, -35, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (48, 37, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: right, head -24, tail -35, span [-35, -24]\n\nSecond car: right, head 12, tail 1, span [1,12]\n\nThird car: right, head 48, tail 37, span [37,48]\n\nAll speed 4.\n\nFreeway k=5: two cars: (24, 13, right, 12), (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFirst: head 24, tail 13, span [13,24]\n\nSecond: head -48, tail -59, span [-59,-48]\n\nSpeed 12.\n\nFreeway k=6: same as k=5, (24,13,right,12) and (-48,-59,right,12), so spans [13,24] and [-59,-48]\n\nFreeway k=7: same, [13,24] and [-59,-48]\n\nFreeway k=8: same, [13,24] and [-59,-48]\n\nNow, I need to be on y=k at turn T, and if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn, I collide.\n\nSince I start at y=4 at t=36, and I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars, but I start at y=4, so I need to move through y=1 to 8, but avoid when cars are at x=0.\n\nNow, for each freeway and each turn, I need to know if x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nBut turns are discrete, so for each turn T, and each freeway k, I can compute if there is a car with 0 in its span at T.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, I can find when they cover x=0.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, with span at t=36, and direction and speed.\n\nLet ΔT = T - 36, so at turn T = 36 + ΔT.\n\nFor a car, if it is right-moving, span at T: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving, from the state.\n\nAll cars are right-moving? Let's check.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3: right\n\nFreeway 4: all right\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8: all right\n\nNo left-moving cars, all are right-moving.\n\nSo for each car, span at turn T: [τ + s (T - 36), h + s (T - 36)]\n\nAnd 0 is in span if τ + s (T-36) <= 0 <= h + s (T-36)\n\nSince for right-moving, τ <= h, so the inequality is min <= 0 <= max.\n\nSimilarly, for multiple cars, if any car on that row has 0 in span, then occupied.\n\nNow, for each freeway k, I need to find the times T when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nBut since I might be on different y at different times, I need for each k, the set of T where (k,T) is unsafe.\n\nThen I need a path from t=36, y=4 to some t, y=9, with minimal H.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=36 to t=36+H-1, I think, with y_{36+H-1} =9.\n\nThe sequence is from t=36 to t=36+H-1, actions for t from 36 to 36+H-1, and after H actions, at turn 36+H, y should be 9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, before action, position is y_t, then I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nI start at turn t_1=36, position (0,y_{36}) = (0,4)\n\nAfter action a_{36}, y_{37} = y_{36} + Δy\n\nAnd so on, until at some turn, say T, y_T =9.\n\nThe position after action a_t is y_{t+1}, so at turn t, I am at y_t, and after action, I move to y_{t+1}.\n\nI reach (0,9) when y_t =9 for some t.\n\nThe minimal H such that y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see the turn indices.\n\nSet t_1 =36.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t_1, I am at y_{t_1}.\n\nI perform action a_{t_1}, which determines Δy, so y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy.\n\nSimilarly, after H actions, I have performed actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and y_{t_1 + H} is set.\n\nI want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t= t_1 to t= t_1 + H -1, and at turn t_1 + H, I am at (0,9).\n\nThe collision: at turn t, when I am at y_t, I need that for that freeway, at turn t, x=0 is not occupied.\n\nThe key point is that when I move, at turn t, I am on y_t, and I check collision for (y_t, t). Then I choose action, and move to y_{t+1}, but at turn t, I am not on y_{t+1} yet, so I don't check y_{t+1} at turn t.\n\nNow, to find min H, since I need to go up 5 units, min H is at least 5 if I always go up, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's for each freeway k=1 to 8, find for which turns T it is occupied at x=0.\n\nStart with freeway 1: k=1, cars: only one car, span at t=36: [-41, -30], speed 3, right-moving.\n\nSo span at T: [-41 + 3(T-36), -30 + 3(T-36)]\n\nSet 0 in span: -41 + 3ΔT <= 0 <= -30 + 3ΔT, where ΔT = T-36\n\nSo -41 + 3ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= -30 + 3ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: 3ΔT <= 41, ΔT <= 41/3 ≈13.666, so ΔT <=13 since integer\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -30 + 3ΔT, so 3ΔT >=30, ΔT >=10\n\nSo for ΔT from 10 to 13 inclusive, occupied.\n\nT from 36+10=46 to 36+13=49.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, same car, so same occupied times: T=46 to 49.\n\nFreeway 3: same, T=46 to 49.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,4), span at t=36: [-35,-24]\n\nAt T: [-35 +4ΔT, -24 +4ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -35 +4ΔT <=0 <= -24 +4ΔT\n\nSo -35 +4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=35 => ΔT <=35/4=8.75, ΔT<=8\n\n0 <= -24 +4ΔT => 4ΔT >=24 => ΔT >=6\n\nSo for ΔT=6,7,8\n\nT=42,43,44\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4), span at t=36: [1,12]\n\nAt T: [1+4ΔT, 12+4ΔT]\n\n0 in span: 1+4ΔT <=0 <=12+4ΔT\n\nBut 1+4ΔT <=0? 4ΔT <=-1, impossible since ΔT >=0.\n\n1+4ΔT >=1 >0, so 0 cannot be <= 1+4ΔT? The inequality is min <=0 <= max.\n\nMin is 1+4ΔT >=1 >0, so 0 < min, so 0 not in [min,max] since min>0.\n\nSimilarly, max=12+4ΔT >0, but min>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nThird car: (48,37,right,4), span at t=36: [37,48], both positive, min=37>0, so 0 not in span, and as T increases, span moves right, min increases, so never covers 0.\n\nSo for freeway 4, only first car can cover 0, at T=42,43,44.\n\nΔT=6,7,8, T=42,43,44.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,12), span at t=36: [13,24]\n\nAt T: [13 +12ΔT, 24 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in span: 13+12ΔT <=0 <=24+12ΔT\n\nBut 13+12ΔT >=13>0, so min>0, 0 not <= min? min <=0 <= max, but min=13+12ΔT>0, so 0 < min, not in span.\n\nSecond car: (-48,-59,right,12), span at t=36: [-59,-48]\n\nAt T: [-59 +12ΔT, -48 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -59 +12ΔT <=0 <= -48 +12ΔT\n\nSo -59 +12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=59 => ΔT <=59/12≈4.916, ΔT<=4\n\n0 <= -48 +12ΔT => 12ΔT >=48 => ΔT >=4\n\nSo ΔT=4, T=36+4=40\n\nOnly at T=40.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5, cars: (24,13,right,12) and (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nFirst car: [13,24] at t=36, min>0, never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: same as above, covers 0 at T=40.\n\nSo freeway 6 occupied only at T=40.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: same, occupied at T=40.\n\nFreeway 8: same, occupied at T=40.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the unsafe turns:\n\nk=1: T=46,47,48,49\n\nk=2: same, T=46,47,48,49\n\nk=3: same, T=46,47,48,49\n\nk=4: T=42,43,44\n\nk=5: T=40\n\nk=6: T=40\n\nk=7: T=40\n\nk=8: T=40\n\nAlso, for k=5,6,7,8, only at T=40, and for k=4 at T=42,43,44, k=1,2,3 at T=46-49.\n\nNow, I start at t=36, y=4.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, and I need to be on each y at some point, but I can skip some if I move directly, but since I move one y at a time, I must pass through intermediate y.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, then I move to y_{t+1} = y_t + a_t, with a_t in {U,D,S}, so y changes by -1,0, or +1.\n\nSo I must visit each y between start and end, but not necessarily, I could go down and up, but since I start at 4 and end at 9, I need to go up, but I might go down to avoid something and come back.\n\nBut to minimize H, I probably want to go up as much as possible, with minimal waiting or detour.\n\nNow, the unsafe times:\n\nFor each row, the times when I cannot be there.\n\nBut I need to be on a row only when it is safe.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nStart at t=36, y=4.\n\nAt t=36, y=4, is it safe? Freeway y=4 is row 4.\n\nFreeway k=4: unsafe at T=42,43,44. At t=36, not in that range, so should be safe? But is there a car at t=36 on row 4?\n\nAt t=36, for row 4, the spans: first car [-35,-24], min=-35<0, max=-24<0, so 0 not in [-35,-24], since both negative.\n\nSecond car [1,12], min=1>0, so 0 not in.\n\nThird car [37,48]>0, not.\n\nSo at t=36, row 4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, I need to check for each turn where I am.\n\nBut for now, at t=36, y=4 safe.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe always, no cars.\n\nSimilarly y=0, but I don't want to go there.\n\nNow, the critical points are the unsafe times for each row.\n\nTo go from y=4 to y=9, I need to cross rows 5,6,7,8.\n\nBut I might need to be on row 4 or lower, but since I start at 4, and go up, rows 5-8 are the ones I must cross.\n\nI can be on a row for multiple turns if I stay.\n\nBut to minimize time, I should move up when possible.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe times for rows:\n\nRow 1: unsafe T=46,47,48,49\n\nRow 2: same\n\nRow 3: same\n\nRow 4: unsafe T=42,43,44\n\nRow 5: unsafe T=40\n\nRow 6: unsafe T=40\n\nRow 7: unsafe T=40\n\nRow 8: unsafe T=40\n\nRow 5 to 8 all unsafe only at T=40.\n\nT=40 is before t=36? t=36 is current, T=40 is future.\n\nt=36 is turn 36, T=40 is turn 40, which is 4 turns later? ΔT=4, T=36+4=40.\n\nSimilarly, row 4 unsafe at T=42,43,44, which is later.\n\nAt t=36, I am at y=4.\n\nI need to go to y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut rows 5-8 are unsafe only at T=40.\n\nThat means at T=40, I cannot be on rows 5,6,7, or 8.\n\nFor other times, they are safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 4 is safe except T=42,43,44.\n\nNow, since T=40 is only one turn, and it's in 4 turns, I need to avoid being on y=5,6,7,8 at t=40.\n\nSimilarly, for row 4, avoid at t=42,43,44.\n\nBut I start at t=36, y=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMinimal steps: if no cars, I can go up 5 times in 5 turns: actions U,U,U,U,U, from t=36 to 40, y from 4 to 5,6,7,8,9 at t=41.\n\nLet's see the timeline.\n\nAt turn t=36: position y=4, perform action a_36\n\nAfter action, y_37 = y_36 + Δy\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSuppose I always go up.\n\nStart: t=36, y=4\n\na_36 = U, then y_37 = 5\n\nAt t=37, I am at y=5, now check collision: row 5 at t=37.\n\nRow 5 unsafe only at t=40, so at t=37, safe.\n\na_37 = U, y_38 =6\n\nt=38, y=6, safe? Row 6 unsafe only at t=40, so t=38 safe.\n\na_38 = U, y_39 =7\n\nt=39, y=7, safe? Row 7 unsafe at t=40, t=39 not 40, safe.\n\na_39 = U, y_40 =8\n\nNow at turn t=40, I am at y=8.\n\nNow, row 8 is unsafe at t=40! Because for row 8, at t=40, it is occupied.\n\nSo if I am at y=8 at t=40, I collide.\n\nNot good.\n\nAfter a_39=U, y_40=8, and at t=40, I am on y=8, which is unsafe.\n\nSo collision.\n\nI need to not be on y=5,6,7,8 at t=40.\n\nIn this path, at t=40, I am at y=8, which is bad.\n\nI could delay or something.\n\nSince rows 5-8 are only unsafe at t=40, I can be on them at other times.\n\nFor example, I can be on y=4 at t=40, but y=4 at t=40 is safe, since row 4 unsafe only at 42-44.\n\nt=40 is before 42.\n\nOr I can be on y=9 at t=40, but y=9 is always safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nMinimal H: if I can reach by t=40, but at t=40, if I am at y=9, that would be good, but let's see.\n\nFrom y=4 to y=9 in 4 actions? Actions from t=36 to t=39, y from 4 to 5,6,7,8 at t=40? After 4 actions, y_{40} = y_{36} + sum of 4 actions.\n\nIf all U, y_{40} = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need 5 actions: after 5 actions, y_{41} = 4 + 5 =9 if all U.\n\nAt turn t=41, y=9.\n\nBut at t=40, if I am at y=8, it is unsafe.\n\nIn the sequence above, with all U, at t=40 I am at y=8, collide.\n\nSo I need to avoid that.\n\nI could stay at y=4 for one turn or something.\n\nLet's think.\n\nI need to not be on rows 5-8 at t=40.\n\nSo at t=40, I should be on y<=4 or y=9.\n\ny=9 is possible, but to be at y=9 at t=40, I need to have y_{40} =9.\n\ny_{40} is set after action at t=39.\n\nAt t=39, I am at some y, say y_{39}, then if I go U, y_{40} = y_{39} +1.\n\nTo have y_{40}=9, I need y_{39}=8, and go U.\n\nBut at t=39, if I am at y=8, row 8 at t=39 is safe, since unsafe only t=40.\n\nThen at t=39, y=8, safe, I go U to y_{40}=9.\n\nAt t=40, I am at y=9, which is safe.\n\nBut how to get to y=8 at t=39.\n\nFrom start.\n\nt=36: y=4, safe, I can go U to y=5 at t=37.\n\nt=37: y=5, safe (since t=37 !=40), go U to y=6 at t=38.\n\nt=38: y=6, safe, go U to y=7 at t=39.\n\nt=39: y=7, safe? Row 7 at t=39, unsafe only at t=40, so t=39 safe. Go U to y=8 at t=40? y_{40} = y_{39} +1 =7+1=8.\n\nBut at t=40, y=8, unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf at t=39 I am at y=7, and I go U, y_{40}=8.\n\nBut I need y_{40}=9, not 8.\n\nTo have y_{40}=9, I need to be at y=8 at t=39 and go U.\n\nBut at t=39, y=8 is safe, but then y_{40}=9.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=39, I need to have moved up faster.\n\nStart: t=36, y=4, go U to y=5 at t=37\n\nt=37, y=5, go U to y=6 at t=38\n\nt=38, y=6, go U to y=7 at t=39\n\nNow at t=39, y=7.\n\nIf I go U, y_{40}=8, but at t=40, y=8 unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, a_39=S, y_{40}=7, then at t=40, y=7, but row 7 unsafe at t=40, collide.\n\nIf I go down, to y=6, then at t=40, y=6, row 6 unsafe, collide.\n\nSo at t=39, if I am at y=7, no matter what I do, at t=40 I will be on y=6,7, or 8, all unsafe at t=40.\n\ny=6,7,8 all unsafe at t=40.\n\nIf I go down to y=6, at t=40 y=6 unsafe.\n\nGo up to y=8, unsafe.\n\nStay y=7, unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=7 at t=39, because from there, at t=40 I must be on 6,7, or 8, all unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I am at y=6 at t=39, same thing: if go U to y=7 at t=40, unsafe; stay y=6 unsafe; go D to y=5, at t=40 y=5 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for y=5 at t=39: go U to y=6 unsafe, stay y=5 unsafe, go D to y=4, at t=40 y=4 safe? Row 4 at t=40.\n\nt=40, row 4: unsafe only at 42,43,44, so t=40 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at t=40 safe.\n\ny=9 at t=40 safe.\n\nSo the only safe positions at t=40 are y=0,1,2,3,4,9.\n\ny=1,2,3: rows 1,2,3 unsafe only at 46-49, t=40 before that, so safe.\n\ny=4 safe as above.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 unsafe at t=40.\n\nSo at t=40, I need to be on y<=4 or y=9.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI start at t=36, y=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe conflict is at t=40.\n\nI have turns t=36,37,38,39 to move, and then t=40.\n\nAfter actions at t=36,37,38,39, I set y_{37},y_{38},y_{39},y_{40}.\n\nAt t=40, y_{40} must be <=4 or =9.\n\nIf y_{40}=9, that means I reached early.\n\ny_{40}=9 requires that from y=4 at t=36, to y=9 at t=40, that means in 4 actions, I increased by 5, which is impossible since max increase is 4 with 4 ups: to y=8.\n\nWith 4 actions, max y_{40} = 4 +4 =8, min =4-4=0, so y_{40} <=8 <9, cannot be 9.\n\nSo impossible to have y_{40}=9.\n\nTherefore, at t=40, I must have y_{40} <=4.\n\nThat is, I must be at y<=4 at turn 40.\n\nThen from there, I can go up to y=9 later.\n\nBut I need to minimize H, so I should go up as soon as possible after t=40.\n\nNow, y_{40} <=4.\n\nI start from y_36=4.\n\nIn 4 actions (t=36 to 39), I can change y by -4 to +4.\n\nSo y_{40} = y_{36} + sum of Δy from t=36 to 39.\n\nSum of 4 actions, each Δy in {-1,0,1}, so y_{40} between 0 and 8.\n\nBut I need y_{40} <=4.\n\nNow, at each step, I need to avoid collision at the current position.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe times for each row:\n\nRow 1: unsafe at T=46,47,48,49\n\nBut t=40 is 36+4, 46 is 36+10, so for now, not relevant yet.\n\nSimilarly row 2,3 same.\n\nRow 4: unsafe at T=42,43,44\n\nRow 5-8: unsafe only at T=40.\n\nNow, for t=36 to 39, I need to be safe at my position.\n\nAt t=36: y=4, safe, as earlier.\n\nI perform a_36.\n\nSuppose I want to decrease y or stay to reach y<=4 at t=40.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually, so perhaps I should not go down, to save time.\n\nI could stay or go up slowly.\n\nSince rows 5-8 are only unsafe at t=40, I can be on them before or after.\n\nBut at t=40, I must not be on them.\n\nSo for example, I can be on y=5 at t=37,38, etc., as long as not t=40.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly, I should go up when possible, but avoid being on y=5-8 at t=40.\n\nSince y_{40} <=4, I need to have moved down or stayed to be low at t=40.\n\nFor instance, I could stay at y=4 for one or more turns.\n\nThen after t=40, go up.\n\nBut let's see the row 4 unsafe times: at t=42,43,44, so I need to not be on row 4 at those times.\n\nSimilarly, rows 1,2,3 unsafe at 46-49.\n\nBut 46 is later, so I might reach y=9 before that.\n\nFirst, let's find a sequence.\n\nOption: stay at y=4 until after t=40.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=36: y=4, safe. I can do S (stay), so y_37=4.\n\nt=37: y=4, safe (t=37<42), do S, y_38=4.\n\nt=38: y=4, safe, do S, y_39=4.\n\nt=39: y=4, safe, do S, y_40=4.\n\nNow at t=40, y=4, which is <=4, safe.\n\nNow, from here, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=4 at t=40.\n\nI can start going up.\n\nBut row 4 will be unsafe at t=42,43,44.\n\nSo I need to leave row 4 before t=42.\n\nt=40,41,42,...\n\nAt t=40, I am at y=4.\n\nI can go up to y=5 at t=41.\n\nt=41: I perform action at t=40.\n\nAt turn t=40, I am at y=4, I choose a_40.\n\nIf I go U, y_41=5.\n\nNow, at t=41, I am at y=5.\n\nIs row 5 safe at t=41? Row 5 unsafe only at t=40, t=41 !=40, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can go up.\n\nBut row 4 unsafe at t=42,43,44.\n\nAt t=41, I am at y=5, not on row 4.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nSequence:\n\nAfter t=40, y=4.\n\na_40: U, then y_41=5\n\nt=41: y=5, safe (t=41 !=40), a_41: U, y_42=6\n\nt=42: y=6, now at t=42, row 6: is it safe? Row 6 unsafe only at t=40, t=42 !=40, so should be safe.\n\nBut row 6 has cars, but unsafe only at t=40, so at t=42, no car at x=0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\na_42: U, y_43=7\n\nt=43: y=7, safe? Row 7 unsafe only t=40, t=43 safe. a_43: U, y_44=8\n\nt=44: y=8, safe? Row 8 unsafe only t=40, safe. a_44: U, y_45=9\n\nNow at t=45, y=9, reached.\n\nBut I need to check if at any point I was on unsafe position.\n\nIn this sequence, I used many stay actions at the beginning.\n\nH is the number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nAt t=45, y=9, which is after 9 actions? Let's count.\n\nStart: actions from t=36 to t=44? Turns: actions at t=36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44.\n\nThat's 9 actions: t=36 to 44, 9 turns.\n\nAfter 9 actions, y_{45} =9.\n\nt=36 to 44 inclusive is 9 actions.\n\nIndices: t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nIn this case, H=9, from t=36 to 44.\n\nBut I can do better.\n\nI wasted 4 turns staying at y=4 from t=36 to 39.\n\nI could move up earlier, as long as I am not on y=5-8 at t=40.\n\nFor example, I can go up to y=7 or something before t=40, but then come down or stay to be low at t=40.\n\nBut coming down might take extra time.\n\nSince I need to be y<=4 at t=40, and I start at y=4, I can go down to y=3 or lower, but that might not help, as I have to come back up.\n\nBetter to stay or move up slowly.\n\nI could go up to y=5 at t=37, for example.\n\nt=36: y=4, a_36=U, y_37=5\n\nt=37: y=5, safe (t=37!=40), now I can go U to y=6 at t=38\n\nt=38: y=6, safe, go U to y=7 at t=39\n\nt=39: y=7, now I need y_40 <=4.\n\nAt t=39, y=7, I must go down to y=6 or less, but if I go D, y_40=6, but y=6 at t=40 unsafe.\n\nIf go S, y_40=7, unsafe.\n\nIf go D to y=6, same.\n\nTo reach y<=4 at t=40, from y=7 at t=39, I need to go down, but y_40 = y_39 + Δy, so if I go D, y_40=6, which is unsafe.\n\nIf I go D twice? But at t=39, I can only do one action.\n\nFrom y=7 at t=39, with one action, I can only go to 6,7, or 8, all unsafe at t=40.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be at y=7,6,5 at t=39, because I cannot reach y<=4 in one step from there without being unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=39 I am at y=4, I can go S to y=4 or D to y=3, etc., safe.\n\nOr if at y=3, go to y=2,3,4.\n\nBut y<=4 safe at t=40.\n\nSo to have y_40<=4, I need to be at y<=4 at t=39, or at y=4 and stay, or y=5 and go down, but y=5 at t=39: if I go D, y_40=4, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at t=39 go D to y=5? y=5 at t=40 unsafe.\n\nLet's systematize.\n\nAt t=39, if I am at y=4, I can:\n\n- S: y_40=4\n\n- D: y_40=3\n\n- U: y_40=5 unsafe\n\nU to 5 unsafe, so only S or D.\n\nIf at t=39 y=5:\n\n- U: y_40=6 unsafe\n\n- S: y_40=5 unsafe\n\n- D: y_40=4 safe\n\nSo I can go D to y=4.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=39 y=6:\n\n- U: y_40=7 unsafe\n\n- S: y_40=6 unsafe\n\n- D: y_40=5 unsafe\n\nAll unsafe, cannot.\n\nSimilarly y=7 or 8 at t=39, all actions lead to unsafe y_40.\n\nTherefore, at t=39, I must be at y=4 or y=5.\n\nIf y=4, I can S or D to y=4 or 3 at t=40.\n\nIf y=5, I must go D to y=4 at t=40.\n\nNow, y=3 at t=40 is also safe, but lower, might take more time to go up.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 is fine.\n\nNow, back to start.\n\nI can move up in the beginning.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=36: y=4, a_36=U, y_37=5\n\nNow t=37: y=5, I can go U to y=6 at t=38\n\nt=38: y=6, now I can go U to y=7 at t=39? But at t=39, if y=7, I cannot go to safe y_40, as above.\n\nAt t=38 y=6, I could go S or D to be at lower y at t=39.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=36: U, y_37=5\n\nt=37: y=5, now instead of going up, I can go S or D to be safe later.\n\nBut I need to reach high.\n\nt=37: y=5, I can go S, so y_38=5\n\nThen t=38: y=5, I can go S, y_39=5\n\nThen at t=39: y=5, I go D, y_40=4 safe.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nBut I used some S actions.\n\nCompared to staying at y=4, I moved to y=5 and stayed, but y=5 is safe except t=40.\n\nIn terms of progress, I am at y=5 at t=38,39, then down to y=4 at t=40, then go up.\n\nBut from y=4 at t=40, I go to y=9 in 5 actions, as before.\n\nBut let's see if I can be at higher y earlier.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=40 I must be low, but after that, I can go up fast.\n\nBut there is row 4 unsafe at t=42,43,44.\n\nIn the previous slow path, when I went up from t=40:\n\nt=40: y=4, a_40=U, y_41=5\n\nt=41: y=5, a_41=U, y_42=6\n\nAt t=42, y=6, but row 4 is unsafe, but I am on y=6, not row 4, so ok.\n\nThen continue to y=7,8,9.\n\nBut at t=42, when I am at y=6, row 4 unsafe, but I am not on it, so fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn that sequence, I reached y=9 at t=45.\n\nBut H=9 actions from t=36 to 44.\n\nt=36 to 44 inclusive, 9 actions.\n\nBut I can reduce by moving up before t=40.\n\nFor example, go to y=5 at t=37, then at t=39 go down to y=4 at t=40.\n\nThen from t=40 y=4, go up.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=36: y=4, a_36=U, y_37=5\n\nt=37: y=5, safe, a_37=S, y_38=5  (I stay or something)\n\nAt t=37, I can go U to y=6, but then at t=38 y=6.\n\nt=38: y=6, I need to go down to be safe at t=39.\n\nAt t=38, y=6, I can go D to y=5 at t=39.\n\nThen at t=39: y=5, I go D to y=4 at t=40.\n\nThen t=40: y=4, safe.\n\nNow, from here, same as before, go up.\n\nActions: t=36: U\n\nt=37: U? Let's not.\n\nt=36: U, y_37=5\n\nt=37: since at t=39 I need to be at y=5 to go down, but I can be at y=5 at t=37.\n\nt=37: y=5, I can do S, y_38=5\n\nt=38: y=5, S, y_39=5\n\nt=39: y=5, D, y_40=4\n\nt=40: y=4, U, y_41=5\n\nt=41: y=5, U, y_42=6\n\nt=42: y=6, U, y_43=7\n\nt_43: y=7, U, y_44=8\n\nt_44: y=8, U, y_45=9\n\nStill reach at t=45, H=9 actions.\n\nBut I have extra stay at y=5.\n\nFrom t=37 y=5, I can go U to y=6 at t=38.\n\nThen at t=38 y=6, I go D to y=5 at t=39.\n\nt=39 y=5, go D to y=4 at t=40.\n\nSame as above, y_40=4.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut in this case: t=36: U, y_37=5\n\nt=37: U, y_38=6\n\nt=38: D, y_39=5  (down to y=5)\n\nt=39: D, y_40=4  (down to y=4)\n\nt=40: U, y_41=5\n\nt=41: U, y_42=6\n\nt_42: U, y_43=7\n\nt_43: U, y_44=8\n\nt_44: U, y_45=9\n\nStill 9 actions, and I went up to 6 and down, wasted motion.\n\nNot better.\n\nCan I reach y=9 earlier than t=45?\n\nFor example, if I can be at higher y after t=40.\n\nBut after t=40, I start from y=4 at t=40, need 5 ups to y=9, at t=45.\n\nUnless I am already higher at t=40, but I must be y<=4 at t=40, so I start from <=4.\n\ny=4 is the highest possible at t=40.\n\nSo minimal to reach y=9 is from y=4 at t=40, takes 5 actions: U at t=40,41,42,43,44 to reach y=9 at t=45.\n\nH=5 actions from t=40 to 44, but I need actions from t=36.\n\nThe actions before t=40 are to position myself at y<=4 at t=40 with minimal time, but since I start at y=4, the fastest is to stay, with 0 net change, so 4 actions: I can do S,S,S,S from t=36 to 39, y stays 4, then at t=40 y=4.\n\nOr I can do other things, but not faster.\n\nIf I go down and up, it takes more actions.\n\nSo minimal H to reach y=9 is 9, with y_45=9.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=9 before t=45.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=41, for example.\n\ny_41=9.\n\nThen from y_36=4 to y_41=9, in 5 actions, increase by 5, so all U: a_36 to a_40 all U.\n\nThen y_37=5, y_38=6, y_39=7, y_40=8, y_41=9.\n\nAt t=40, y=8, which is unsafe, collide.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSimilarly, y_42=9: with 6 actions, but if I go all U except one stay or something, but y_42=9 requires net +5 in 6 actions, possible with 5U and one S, for example.\n\nBut let's see positions.\n\nSuppose I do actions to have y_41=8 or something.\n\nBut at t=40, I need to be safe.\n\nSuppose I do:\n\nt=36: U, y_37=5\n\nt=37: U, y_38=6\n\nt=38: U, y_39=7\n\nNow at t=39 y=7, I cannot go to safe y_40, as before.\n\nIf I do t=36: S, y_37=4\n\nt=37: U, y_38=5\n\nt=38: U, y_39=6\n\nt=39: y=6, must go down to y=5 or less, but y=5 at t=40 unsafe.\n\nGo D to y=5, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nt=36: D, y_37=3\n\nThen I am lower, worse.\n\nSo I think it's impossible to reach before t=45.\n\nBut what about the row 4 unsafe at t=42,43,44.\n\nIn the path above, when I go up from t=40, at t=42 I am at y=6, not on row 4, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut at t=41, when I am at y=5, row 4 is not relevant.\n\nNow, but I need to consider if I can be on row 4 after t=40, but in the path, I leave row 4 at t=40 or before.\n\nIn the sequence, I am at row 4 until t=40, then move up.\n\nt=40 I am at y=4, then go to y=5 at t=41, so at t=41 I am not on row 4.\n\nRow 4 unsafe at t=42,43,44, but I am not on it, so fine.\n\nNow, but rows 1,2,3 unsafe at t=46-49, but I reach y=9 at t=45, before that, so no problem.\n\nt=45 is before 46.\n\nSo with H=9, it works.\n\nBut can I do with less than 9?\n\nFor example, H=8 actions, reach y=9 at t=44.\n\ny_44=9.\n\nThen from y_36=4 to y_44=9, in 8 actions, net +5, so I need 5 U and 3 other actions that cancel, like 5U, 3S or 5U,2S,1D, etc., but y increases only by number of U minus number of D.\n\nNet increase must be 5 in 8 actions, so let U be number of up, D down, S stay, U + D + S =8, y_44 - y_36 = U - D =5.\n\nSo U - D =5, U + D + S =8.\n\nThen 2U + S =13, since U = D +5, so (D+5) + D + S =8, 2D + S +5=8, 2D + S=3.\n\nPossible: D=0, S=3, U=5; or D=1, S=1, U=6; etc.\n\nNow, with U=5, D=0, S=3: I go up 5 times and stay 3 times.\n\nBut I need to be safe at each position and avoid t=40 on rows 5-8.\n\nSuppose I stay at some points.\n\nFor example, at t=36: S, y_37=4\n\nt=37: S, y_38=4\n\nt=38: S, y_39=4\n\nt=39: U, y_40=5? But at t=40 y=5, unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nt=36: U, y_37=5\n\nt=37: S, y_38=5\n\nt=38: S, y_39=5\n\nt=39: D, y_40=4  (since from y=5 go D to y=4)\n\nThen y_40=4 safe.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9 in 4 more actions? Actions from t=40 to t=43 for y_44.\n\ny_40=4, to y_44=9, need +5 in 4 actions, impossible, max +4.\n\ny_44 is after 4 actions from t=40 to 43.\n\ny_44 = y_40 + sum_{t=40 to 43} Δy\n\nMax sum +4, so y_44 <=8 <9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 by t=44 if start from y=4 at t=40.\n\ny_40 <=4, y_44 <= y_40 +4 <=8<9.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 before t=45.\n\nSimilarly, for any earlier.\n\nThus minimal H is 9, with y_45=9.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I need to specify actions.\n\nFrom the above, one way: stay at y=4 for the first four turns.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 36: S (stay)\n\nBut action: at turn t, I choose a_t.\n\nAt turn 36, I am at (0,4), I choose a_36.\n\nIf I choose S, then y_37 = y_36 + 0 =4.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 36: S  // y_37=4\n\nTurn 37: S  // y_38=4\n\nTurn 38: S  // y_39=4\n\nTurn 39: S  // y_40=4\n\nNow at turn 40: I am at y=4, choose a_40=U, so y_41=5\n\nTurn 41: at y=5, choose U, y_42=6\n\nTurn 42: at y=6, choose U, y_43=7\n\nTurn 43: at y=7, choose U, y_44=8\n\nTurn 44: at y=8, choose U, y_45=9\n\nNow, after action at turn 44, y_45=9.\n\nH=9 actions, from t=36 to 44.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions for t=36 to t=44.\n\nBut in the sequence, at each turn, I need to output the action.\n\nIn this, I have turn 36 to 39: S, then turn 40 to 44: U.\n\nBut is there any collision?\n\nCheck positions:\n\nAt t=36: y=4, row 4 safe, as before.\n\nt=37: y=4, row 4 safe (t=37<42)\n\nt=38: y=4, safe\n\nt=39: y=4, safe\n\nt=40: y=4, safe (t=40<42)\n\na_40=U, move to y=5 at t=41\n\nt=41: at y=5, row 5 safe? t=41 !=40, yes safe.\n\na_41=U, to y=6 at t=42\n\nt=42: y=6, row 6 safe? t=42 !=40, yes.\n\na_42=U, to y=7 at t=43\n\nt=43: y=7, safe? t=43 !=40, yes.\n\na_43=U, to y=8 at t=44\n\nt=44: y=8, safe? t=44 !=40, yes.\n\na_44=U, to y=9 at t=45.\n\nAll safe.\n\nI could have moved up a bit earlier, but it doesn't save time, since I need to be at y=4 at t=40 anyway.\n\nFor example, I could do:\n\nTurn 36: U // to y=5 at t=37\n\nTurn 37: S // stay at y=5, y_38=5\n\nTurn 38: S // y_39=5\n\nTurn 39: D // to y=4 at t=40, y_40=4\n\nThen same as before, turn 40: U to y=5, etc.\n\nBut this has the same number of actions, and I end at t=45 still.\n\nBut in this case, I used D action, which might not be necessary.\n\nBut H is same.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nNow, about row 4 unsafe at t=42,43,44, but in this path, at t=42 I am at y=6, not on row 4, so fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut in the format, it should be:\n\nTurn 36: a_{36} = S\n\nTurn 37: a_{37} = S\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 44.\n\nBut let's list:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 36: S\n\nTurn 37: S\n\nTurn 38: S\n\nTurn 39: S\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nAfter these 9 actions, at turn 45, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 44: U, to y=9 at t=45.\n\nBut the last action is at turn 44, H=9.\n\nIs there a sequence with H=8? We saw it's impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at t=44 with different path.\n\ny_44=9.\n\nThen y_44 = y_36 + sum_{t=36 to 43} of 8 actions Δy.\n\ny_36=4, y_44=9, so sum Δy =5 over 8 actions.\n\nSo U - D =5, and U + D + S =8.\n\nThen 2U + S =13, as before.\n\nPossible: U=5, D=0, S=3 or U=6, D=1, S=1, etc.\n\nNow, with U=5, D=0, S=3: I need to place the stays.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on y=5-8 at t=40.\n\nt=40 is one of the turns.\n\nAt turn t=40, I am at y_{40}, which is after actions up to t=39? y_{40} is set after action at t=39.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, before action.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, position y_t.\n\nThen I perform a_t, then y_{t+1} is new position.\n\nFor collision, at turn t, I check based on y_t and t.\n\nIn this case, for t=40, I need y_{40} <=4 or 9, but y_{40}=9 impossible as before.\n\ny_{40} <=4.\n\nNow, y_{40} depends on actions from t=36 to t=39.\n\nActions at t=36,37,38,39 determine y_{37},y_{38},y_{39},y_{40}.\n\ny_{40} = y_{36} + sum_{k=36}^{39} Δy_k = 4 + sum of four actions.\n\nTo have y_{40} <=4, since start at 4, sum of Δy from t=36 to 39 must be <=0.\n\nThat is, number of D minus number of U >=0, or with S.\n\nBut I also need to reach y_44=9.\n\ny_44 = y_{40} + sum_{t=40}^{43} Δy_t\n\ny_44=9, so y_{40} + sum_{40 to 43} Δy =9.\n\nSince y_{40} <=4, sum_{40 to 43} Δy >=5.\n\nBut in 4 actions, max sum Δy is +4, so sum <=4 <5, contradiction.\n\nTherefore, impossible to have y_44=9 with y_{40} <=4.\n\nThus, cannot reach by t=44.\n\nSimilarly for earlier.\n\nHence, minimal H is 9.\n\nNow, in the sequence above, I have four S at the beginning, but I could have different actions as long as I end up at y<=4 at t=40.\n\nFor example, I could go down and up, but it might not save time.\n\nSince I need to be at y=4 at t=40, and start at y=4, staying is efficient.\n\nBut to make it with all U possible, but not.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose I go to y=5 at some point but come back.\n\nBut no benefit.\n\nI think the sequence is fine.\n\nNow, about the row 1,2,3 unsafe later, but I don't go there, so irrelevant.\n\nIn the car state, freeway 1,2,3 have cars, but I am on row 4 to 8, not on 1,2,3.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the sequence should work.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbers.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=36.\n\nActions from t=36 to t=36+H-1.\n\nH=9, so t=36 to 44.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 36: S\n\nTurn 37: S\n\nTurn 38: S\n\nTurn 39: S\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nIn the output, it should be written as:\n\nTurn 36: a_{36} = S\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 36: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 39: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 40: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 41: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 42: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 43: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 44: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 44, I go U to y=9 at t=45.\n\nYes.\n\nTo make it cleaner, since I need to go up, but I had to wait.\n\nBut I think this is minimal.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 42,43,44, when I am going up, row 4 is unsafe, but I am not on row 4, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 36\\) is 9, with the sequence of actions specified below.\n\n### Explanation:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 4\\) at turn 36.\n- The critical constraint is that at turn 40, rows \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are occupied by cars at \\(x = 0\\), so the player must not be on these rows at turn 40. The only safe positions at turn 40 are \\(y \\leq 4\\) or \\(y = 9\\).\n- It is impossible to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 44 or earlier because:\n  - To be at \\(y \\leq 4\\) at turn 40 (required for safety), and then reach \\(y = 9\\) in at least 5 more actions (since each \"up\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1), the earliest possible arrival at \\(y = 9\\) is turn 45.\n- Thus, the minimal \\(H\\) is 9, with actions from turn 36 to turn 44, resulting in \\(y_{45} = 9\\).\n- The sequence involves:\n  - Staying at \\(y = 4\\) for turns 36 to 39 to avoid being on rows 5-8 at turn 40.\n  - Moving up from turn 40 to turn 44 to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 45.\n- All positions during the sequence are safe:\n  - Turns 36-39: At \\(y = 4\\), which is safe because row 4 is only unsafe at turns 42-44, and the player is not on row 4 during those turns.\n  - Turns 41-44: Moving through rows 5-8, which are safe except at turn 40 (avoided by being at \\(y = 4\\) then).\n- Row 4 is unsafe at turns 42-44, but the player is on rows 6, 7, 8, or 9 during these turns, so no collision occurs.\n- Rows 1-3 are unsafe at turns 46-49, but the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) by turn 45, so this is irrelevant.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}\\) for \\(t = 36\\) to \\(t = 44\\) is:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 36: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 39: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 40: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 41: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 42: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 43: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 44: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 40, and the player is at (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn the player is on a freeway k (which is the y-coordinate) and there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nNote: The player's movement is only in the y-direction (vertical). The cars move horizontally on their freeways (fixed y).\n\nPlayer actions: U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay: y same). The y-coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nWe start at y=0 (which is not a freeway? note freeways are y=1 to 8). The goal is y=9 (which is also not a freeway). So we only need to worry about collisions when we are on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nAt turn T, if we are at y_T (which is between 1 and 8) then we check the cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nCar update:\n- Left-moving: the car moves left, so the entire span shifts left by s*(T-t1) from the initial state at t1.\n- Right-moving: the car moves right, so the entire span shifts right by s*(T-t1).\n\nBut note: the initial state at t1 (current turn) is given for each freeway.\n\nWe have to compute the car's span at any future turn T (>= t1).\n\nFor a car given at t1 as (head, tail, direction, speed):\n- If direction is 'right', then the car is moving to the right. The initial span at t1 is [tau, head] (because the head is the front? but the table says for right: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\"? Actually, the table says for right: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\" and then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. Similarly, for left: [h, tau] at t1 becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note the example: \n  For freeway 4: (-48,-59,right,4) -> that would be [tau=-59, h=-48] at t1=40? But that doesn't make sense because -59 is less than -48. Actually, the table says for right: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\" meaning from tau to h? and tau < h? But here tau=-59 and h=-48, so tau < h? Actually, -59 < -48, so the car spans from -59 to -48? But that's 11 units? \n\nBut then the car moves right: at time T, the span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] = [-59 + 4*(T-40), -48 + 4*(T-40)].\n\nSimilarly, the other cars on freeway 4: (-12,-23,right,4) -> [ -23, -12] at t1? and (24,13,right,4) -> wait, 13 and 24? then [13,24] at t1? But that doesn't make sense because 13<24, so the car is from 13 to 24? and moving right: [13+4*(T-40), 24+4*(T-40)].\n\nBut wait: the table says for right: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\" and then lists (head, tail) as (h, tau). So the head is the front? Then for a right-moving car, the head is at the rightmost? So the car spans from tail to head? So the tail is the left end and head the right end? \n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: head is the leftmost? and tail the rightmost? So the car spans from head (left) to tail (right)? But then the table says for left: \"Span(t1)=[h, tau]\" -> so [head, tail] and then shifts left.\n\nSo in summary:\n- For a right-moving car: the car at t1 is [tail, head] (with tail < head) and moves to [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)] at T.\n- For a left-moving car: the car at t1 is [head, tail] (with head < tail) and moves to [head - s*(T-t1), tail - s*(T-t1)] at T.\n\nBut in the given data, we have:\nFreeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3) -> tail = -59, head = -48? Then at t1=40, the car is from -59 to -48? But note: -59 < -48, so that's a length of 11. Then at time T, the car is at [-59 + 3*(T-40), -48 + 3*(T-40)].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: two cars: \n  (-48, -59, right, 12) -> tail=-59, head=-48 -> span at T: [-59+12*(T-40), -48+12*(T-40)]\n  (0, -11, right, 12) -> tail=-11, head=0 -> span at T: [-11+12*(T-40), 0+12*(T-40)]\n\nNow, collision condition: at turn T, if we are at (0, k) for k in {1,...,8}, then we check the cars on freeway k at turn T: if 0 is in any of the spans of the cars on that freeway at that turn, then collision.\n\nImportant note: when we move from y_t to y_{t+1} at turn t, we are only present on freeway y_t at turn t. Then at turn t+1, we are on freeway y_{t+1} (if we moved) and so on.\n\nSo if we are at turn t at (0, y_t), then we are on freeway y_t at that turn. Then we choose an action and at turn t+1 we are at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nWe start at (0,0) at turn 40. We are not on any freeway at turn 40 (since freeways are 1-8). So no collision at turn 40.\n\nWe need to get to (0,9). We can only move one step at a time (or stay). So we must go through freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H (number of turns) and a sequence of actions from turn 40 to turn 40+H-1 such that at the end we are at y=9.\n\nSince we start at 0 and need to go to 9, the minimal number of moves without any obstacles would be 9 moves (all U). But we have to avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe have to simulate the car positions at each future turn.\n\nWe'll compute for each freeway and each car, the span at any turn T (>=40).\n\nWe are going to plan a path: we are at y=0 at T=40. Then at T=41, we can be at y=0 (if S), y=1 (if U), or we cannot go down because y cannot be negative? Actually, the update: y_{t+1} is in [0,9]. So if we are at 0 and choose D, we stay at 0? Or does it clamp? The update says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and then we have y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we try to go down from 0, we get y_{t+1}= max(0, y_t-1) = 0.\n\nSimilarly, from 9, if we go up we stay at 9.\n\nSo from 0: \n  U -> 1\n  D -> 0\n  S -> 0\n\nFrom 9:\n  U -> 9\n  D -> 8\n  S -> 9\n\nWe need to get to 9.\n\nWe'll consider the state as (turn, y). We start at (40,0). We want to reach (T,9) for some T>=40.\n\nWe'll use BFS (breadth-first search) to find the minimal H (which is the number of turns, so the number of steps from turn 40 to the turn when we first get to 9).\n\nBut note: the state space: turn can go up to ... well, we are looking for minimal turns, so we'll expand by turns.\n\nThe cars move with time, so the obstacles are time-dependent.\n\nWe need to check at each state (turn, y) whether it is safe.\n\nBut note: when we are at (turn, y), we are only concerned if y is between 1 and 8. Then we check the cars on freeway y at that turn.\n\nIf y is 0 or 9, then no collision.\n\nWe have to compute the car positions at each turn for each freeway.\n\nLet's define the turns: we are at turn 40, then 41, 42, etc.\n\nWe'll simulate the car positions for freeways 1 to 8 at each turn.\n\nBut note: we have multiple cars per freeway? Yes, for example freeway 4 has 3 cars, freeways 5-8 have 2 cars.\n\nWe'll precompute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each car on that freeway, the span at turn T.\n\nThen, at a state (T, y) with y in [1,8], we check: for freeway y, for every car on that freeway, check if 0 is in the span of that car at turn T. If at least one car has 0 in its span, then collision -> invalid state.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nWe'll do BFS starting from (40,0) and we stop when we reach (T,9) for the first time (which will be minimal T).\n\nBut note: we can also stay at 0 for multiple turns? But that would increase H, so in BFS we will find the minimal H. Since we are expanding by time, the first time we get to 9 is the minimal.\n\nHowever, note that we might have to wait sometimes (by staying at a freeway that is safe? or by staying at 0 or 9). But staying at 0 or 9 is safe because no cars.\n\nBut staying at 0 doesn't help to get to 9? Actually, we might avoid a collision by waiting at 0 until a car passes? But at 0 we are safe, and we can wait.\n\nSimilarly, we can go back to 0 from 1? But that might not be efficient.\n\nBut minimal H might require waiting? For example, if we go up and then a car is coming, we might have to wait at 0 until the car passes.\n\nSo we must consider the possibility of staying at 0 for several turns.\n\nSimilarly, we might have to wait at a freeway? But if we are at a freeway, we can only stay (S) if that freeway is safe at that turn? Or we can move up or down.\n\nWe'll do BFS in the state space (turn, y). The state is (t, y). The actions are U, D, S.\n\nWe start at (40,0). The goal is (t,9) for any t.\n\nWe'll expand by time: from state (t, y), we consider next actions leading to (t+1, y') where:\n\n- If we choose U: then y' = min(9, y+1)\n- If we choose D: then y' = max(0, y-1)\n- If we choose S: then y' = y\n\nBut note: at the next state (t+1, y'), we must check:\n\n- If y' is in [1,8], then we check for collision at turn t+1? Actually, at the moment we are at (t+1, y'), we are on freeway y' at turn t+1. So we check the cars on freeway y' at turn t+1.\n\nBut what about during the transition? The problem says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So at turn T, we are only at y_T, and at turn T+1 we are at y_{T+1}. So we are only present at one freeway per turn.\n\nTherefore, we only check at the state (t, y) if y is in [1,8] at that turn t.\n\nSo for the next state (t+1, y'), we check:\n\n- If y' is in [1,8], then we must ensure that at turn t+1, on freeway y', 0 is not in any car's span.\n\nIf y' is 0 or 9, then no check -> safe.\n\nWe'll generate the next states and check safety for the next state.\n\nWe'll use a queue for BFS. We mark states (t,y) that we have visited to avoid cycles? But note: we can go backwards? For example, from y=1 we might go back to 0. But we also have to consider that the car positions change with time, so a state (t,y) might be safe at time t, but if we come back to the same y at a later time, the cars have moved so it might be different.\n\nTherefore, we cannot mark (t,y) as visited because the same y at a different time t is a different state (and the car positions are different). So we do not mark states as visited? But then we might loop? For example, we could oscillate between 0 and 1. We must avoid infinite loops.\n\nBut note: the minimal H should be finite? And we are looking for the minimal H. Since we are doing BFS by time (by the number of steps from start), we will not loop because the time always increases. We are expanding by time: we start at time 40, then 41, then 42, etc. So we will not visit the same (t,y) twice because t increases. But we might visit the same y at different t? Yes, but that's allowed and we have to consider.\n\nHowever, we must avoid cycles that are not improving? But BFS by time (i.e., by depth) will naturally avoid cycles because we are moving forward in time. Each step increases the time by 1. So we are building a tree that expands in time.\n\nWe can do:\n\n  Let Q be a queue.\n  Start: (t=40, y=0, path_actions=[])\n  We want to find the minimal t' such that we have y=9.\n\n  While Q not empty:\n      Pop state (t, y, actions_so_far)\n      If y == 9, then we are done: H = len(actions_so_far) and the actions are actions_so_far.\n\n      Otherwise, for each action in [U, D, S]:\n          Compute next_y = \n            if U: min(9, y+1)\n            if D: max(0, y-1)\n            if S: y\n\n          Then next_t = t+1.\n\n          Now, if next_y is in [1,8]:\n              Check if at turn next_t, on freeway next_y, there is a collision? i.e., is 0 in any car's span on freeway next_y at turn next_t?\n              If yes, skip this action.\n              If no, then add state (next_t, next_y, actions_so_far + [action]) to Q.\n\n          Else (next_y is 0 or 9): safe, so add state.\n\nBut note: we are at turn next_t at position (0, next_y). For next_y=0 or 9, we don't check cars -> safe.\n\nWe have to precompute for each freeway and each car the span at any turn? But the turn we are going to is increasing: we start at 40, then 41, ... so we can compute on the fly.\n\nWe'll write a helper function: is_safe(t, y) that returns True if at turn t, on freeway y (y in 1..8), there is no car that has 0 in its span.\n\nHow to compute for a freeway y at turn t:\n\n  For each car on freeway y (from the given state at t1=40):\n      Let the car be (head, tail, direction, speed) = (h, tau, d, s)\n      Let dt = t - 40   (since t1=40)\n\n      If d == 'right':\n          tail_t = tau + s * dt\n          head_t = h + s * dt\n          The span at t is [tail_t, head_t] (a closed interval? we assume inclusive). We need to check if 0 is between tail_t and head_t (inclusive).\n\n      If d == 'left':\n          head_t = h - s * dt\n          tail_t = tau - s * dt\n          Then the span is [head_t, tail_t] (but note: for left, the head is the leftmost? and tail is the rightmost? so the interval is [head_t, tail_t] and we check if 0 is in [head_t, tail_t].\n\nBut note: the problem says for left: the car spans from head to tail? and then shifts left. So at t1, the span is [h, tau]. Then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So the left end is h - s*(T-t1) and the right end is tau - s*(T-t1). And since h < tau? (because the head is the leftmost and tail the rightmost) then the interval is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut in the given data, we have no left-moving cars? All are right? \n\nLooking at the data:\n\nAll cars are right-moving. So we only need to handle right.\n\nSo for a car (h, tau, 'right', s) at t1=40:\n\n  At turn t (>=40):\n      tail_t = tau + s*(t-40)\n      head_t = h + s*(t-40)\n\n  Then the car occupies [tail_t, head_t] (and note: because it's right-moving, the tail is the left end and head the right end? But the given: freeway 4: (-48,-59,right,4) -> so h=-48, tau=-59? Then tail_t = -59 + s*(t-40), head_t = -48 + s*(t-40). Then the interval is [tail_t, head_t] and since tail_t < head_t, that's increasing? So we require tail_t <= 0 <= head_t for collision.\n\nBut wait: the car spans from tail_t to head_t? So if 0 is between tail_t and head_t (inclusive), then collision.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5: (0, -11, right, 12): at t1=40, the car is from -11 to 0? Then at t=40, if we were on freeway 5 at t=40, then 0 is in [ -11, 0] -> collision. But we are at t=40 at y=0, so we are safe.\n\nNow, let's compute the cars for each freeway at a given turn.\n\nWe'll write a function:\n\n  def car_span_at_t(car, t):\n      # car = (head, tail, d, s) as given at t1=40\n      h, tau, d, s = car\n      dt = t - 40\n      if d == 'right':\n          left_end = tau + s * dt\n          right_end = h + s * dt\n          return (left_end, right_end)\n      # if there were left, we would do:\n      # else: # left\n      #   left_end = h - s * dt\n      #   right_end = tau - s * dt\n      #   return (left_end, right_end)\n\nThen for a freeway y at turn t, we have a list of cars (from the table). We check each car: if the interval (left_end, right_end) covers 0? i.e., if left_end <= 0 <= right_end.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T)\". So we check each car.\n\nNow, we have the car data:\n\nFreeway 1: [ (-48, -59, 'right', 3) ]\nFreeway 2: [ (-48, -59, 'right', 3) ]\nFreeway 3: [ (-48, -59, 'right', 3) ]\nFreeway 4: [ (-48, -59, 'right', 4), (-12, -23, 'right', 4), (24, 13, 'right', 4) ] \n  Wait: the last car: (24,13,...) -> but 13 is less than 24? So tail=13, head=24? Then the car is from 13 to 24? But that doesn't make sense because at t1=40, we are at x=0, and the car is from 13 to 24 -> so 0 is not in [13,24]. But note: the data says (head, tail) = (24,13)? Then tail=13, head=24 -> so [13,24] at t1? Then at t1, the car is from 13 to 24? So 0 is not there.\n\nBut wait: the table says for freeway 4: \n  (-48,-59,right,4) -> tail=-59, head=-48 -> [-59, -48] at t1? Then 0 is not in [-59,-48]? (since -59<=x<=-48 -> x negative, so 0 is not included).\n  (-12,-23,right,4) -> tail=-23, head=-12 -> [-23,-12] -> 0 not in.\n  (24,13,right,4) -> tail=13, head=24 -> [13,24] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 4 is safe at t1=40? But we are at t1=40 at y=0, so we don't care.\n\nBut what about at future turns? The cars move.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: \n  [ (-48,-59,right,12), (0,-11,right,12) ]\n\nAt t1=40:\n  car1: tail=-59, head=-48 -> [-59,-48] -> safe at t1 (0 not in)\n  car2: tail=-11, head=0 -> [-11,0] -> at t1=40, 0 is the head? so 0 is included? -> collision at t1 if we are on freeway5 at t1.\n\nBut we are at y=0 at t1, so we are safe.\n\nNow, let's compute for freeway5 at some future turn:\n\n  For the car (0,-11,right,12): \n      tail_t = -11 + 12*(t-40)\n      head_t = 0 + 12*(t-40)\n\n  We want to know when 0 is in [tail_t, head_t]? \n      tail_t <= 0 <= head_t\n\n  But head_t = 12*(t-40) -> which is nonnegative for t>=40? \n      At t=40: head_t=0 -> 0<=0<=0 -> collision? \n      But at t=40, we have head_t=0, tail_t=-11 -> so [ -11, 0] -> 0 is included.\n\n  So at any turn t when we are on freeway5, we must avoid the time when 0 is in [ -11+12*(t-40), 12*(t-40) ].\n\n  Solve: \n      -11 + 12*(t-40) <= 0 <= 12*(t-40)\n\n  The second inequality: 0<=12*(t-40) -> t>=40 -> always true for t>=40.\n\n  The first: -11 + 12*(t-40) <= 0 -> 12*(t-40) <= 11 -> t-40 <= 11/12 < 1 -> so t-40=0 -> only at t=40.\n\n  Therefore, for t>40, the car has moved: at t=41: tail_t = -11+12=1, head_t=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in. So freeway5 is safe at t=41 and beyond? \n\n  But wait: what about the other car? (-48,-59,right,12): \n      tail_t = -59+12*(t-40)\n      head_t = -48+12*(t-40)\n\n      We require: -59+12*(t-40) <= 0 <= -48+12*(t-40)\n\n      First: -59+12*(t-40) <= 0 -> 12*(t-40) <= 59 -> t-40 <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916 -> so t<=44 (since at t=44: 12*4=48 -> -59+48=-11<=0, at t=45: 12*5=60 -> -59+60=1>0) -> fails the first inequality at t>=45.\n\n      Second: 0 <= -48+12*(t-40) -> 48 <= 12*(t-40) -> t-40>=4 -> t>=44.\n\n      So both inequalities: \n          t-40 >= ceil(48/12)=4 -> t>=44\n          t-40 <= floor(59/12)=4 (since 59/12=4.916) -> so t<=44 (because at t=45, 12*5=60, then -59+60=1>0 so the first inequality fails).\n\n      Therefore, only at t=44: \n          tail_t = -59+12*4 = -59+48 = -11\n          head_t = -48+12*4 = -48+48=0\n          So the car spans [-11,0] at t=44 -> 0 is included? -> collision at t=44.\n\n      So freeway5 is unsafe at t=44? \n\n      Actually: at t=44: \n          car1: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included.\n          car2: at t=44: [-11+48, 0+48] = [37,48] -> 0 not included.\n\n      So at t=44, freeway5 is unsafe.\n\n      At t=45: \n          car1: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> safe.\n          car2: [ -11+60, 0+60] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\n      So freeway5 is safe at t=45 and beyond? \n\n      But at t=40: we had car2: [ -11,0] -> unsafe? but we weren't there.\n\n      So freeway5 is unsafe at t=40 and t=44? and safe at t=41,42,43,45,46,...\n\n      Actually, t=40: unsafe (by car2) and t=44: unsafe (by car1). \n\n      How about t=41,42,43?\n        t=41:\n          car1: [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36] -> safe (0 not in)\n          car2: [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        t=42: \n          car1: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n          car2: [-11+24,0+24]=[13,24] -> safe.\n\n        t=43:\n          car1: [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n          car2: [-11+36,0+36]=[25,36] -> safe.\n\n        t=44: unsafe (as above)\n        t=45: safe.\n\nSo we can be on freeway5 at t=41,42,43,45,... \n\nSimilarly, we have to do for every freeway.\n\nBut note: freeways 6,7,8 have the same cars as freeway5? \n\nFreeway6: same as freeway5: two cars: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12) -> same as freeway5.\n\nFreeway7: same.\nFreeway8: same.\n\nSo freeways 5,6,7,8 have the same pattern: unsafe at t=40 and t=44, safe at t=41,42,43,45,...\n\nNow freeway1: one car: (-48,-59,right,3)\n\n  At t:\n      tail_t = -59 + 3*(t-40)\n      head_t = -48 + 3*(t-40)\n\n  Check when 0 in [tail_t, head_t]:\n      -59+3*(t-40) <= 0 <= -48+3*(t-40)\n\n  First: -59+3*(t-40)<=0 -> 3*(t-40)<=59 -> t-40<=59/3≈19.666 -> t<=59 (approx)\n\n  Second: 0<=-48+3*(t-40) -> 48<=3*(t-40) -> t-40>=16 -> t>=56.\n\n  Then both: 16<= t-40 <=19.666 -> so t in [56,59] (integer t: 56,57,58,59)\n\n  At t=56: \n      tail_t = -59+3*16 = -59+48 = -11\n      head_t = -48+48 = 0 -> [ -11, 0] -> 0 included -> unsafe.\n\n  At t=57: \n      tail_t = -59+3*17 = -59+51=-8\n      head_t = -48+51=3 -> [-8,3] -> 0 included -> unsafe.\n\n  At t=58: \n      tail_t = -59+54 = -5\n      head_t = -48+54=6 -> [-5,6] -> unsafe.\n\n  At t=59:\n      tail_t = -59+57 = -2\n      head_t = -48+57=9 -> [-2,9] -> unsafe.\n\n  At t=60: \n      tail_t = -59+60=1\n      head_t = -48+60=12 -> [1,12] -> safe.\n\n  So freeway1: unsafe at t in [56,59], safe otherwise? But what about before t=56? \n\n  For t<56: \n      The second inequality: 0<=-48+3*(t-40) -> requires t>=56? So for t<56, the second inequality fails -> 0 is not in the interval? \n\n  And the first inequality: for t<56, we have 3*(t-40)<48? -> but the first inequality is only necessary condition. Actually, we require both.\n\n  So freeway1 is safe for t in [40,55] and [60, ...]? \n\n  But check at t=40: \n      tail_t = -59, head_t=-48 -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n  So freeway1 is safe at t=40,41,...,55,60,... and unsafe at 56,57,58,59.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2 and freeway3: same as freeway1? \n\nFreeway2: same car: (-48,-59,right,3) -> same as freeway1.\nFreeway3: same.\n\nSo freeways 1,2,3: unsafe at t=56,57,58,59; safe otherwise.\n\nNow freeway4: three cars.\n\nCar1: (-48,-59,right,4) -> same as above but speed=4? \n  tail_t = -59+4*(t-40)\n  head_t = -48+4*(t-40)\n\n  Check: \n      -59+4*(t-40) <= 0 <= -48+4*(t-40)\n\n  Second: 0<=-48+4*(t-40) -> 48<=4*(t-40) -> t-40>=12 -> t>=52.\n\n  First: -59+4*(t-40)<=0 -> 4*(t-40)<=59 -> t-40<=14.75 -> t<=54.\n\n  So t in [52,54] (integer: 52,53,54)\n\n  At t=52: \n      tail_t = -59+4*12=-59+48=-11\n      head_t = -48+48=0 -> [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\n  At t=53:\n      tail_t=-59+4*13=-59+52=-7\n      head_t=-48+52=4 -> [-7,4] -> unsafe.\n\n  At t=54:\n      tail_t=-59+56=-3\n      head_t=-48+56=8 -> unsafe.\n\n  At t=55: \n      tail_t=-59+60=1 -> safe.\n\nCar2: (-12,-23,right,4)\n  tail_t=-23+4*(t-40)\n  head_t=-12+4*(t-40)\n\n  Check: \n      -23+4*(t-40)<=0<=-12+4*(t-40)\n\n  Second: 0<=-12+4*(t-40) -> 12<=4*(t-40) -> t-40>=3 -> t>=43.\n\n  First: -23+4*(t-40)<=0 -> 4*(t-40)<=23 -> t-40<=5.75 -> t<=45.\n\n  So t in [43,45]\n\n  At t=43: \n      tail_t=-23+4*3=-23+12=-11\n      head_t=-12+12=0 -> unsafe.\n\n  At t=44:\n      tail_t=-23+16=-7\n      head_t=-12+16=4 -> unsafe.\n\n  At t=45:\n      tail_t=-23+20=-3\n      head_t=-12+20=8 -> unsafe.\n\n  At t=46: \n      tail_t=-23+24=1 -> safe.\n\nCar3: (24,13,right,4) -> note: tail=13, head=24? \n  tail_t=13+4*(t-40)\n  head_t=24+4*(t-40)\n\n  Then the interval is [13+4*(t-40), 24+4*(t-40)] -> which is positive for t>=40? so 0 not included -> always safe.\n\nSo freeway4: \n  unsafe at t in [43,45] (from car2) and [52,54] (from car1) and safe otherwise.\n\nSummary for freeways:\n\nFreeway1: unsafe at t in [56,59]\nFreeway2: same as freeway1: [56,59]\nFreeway3: same: [56,59]\nFreeway4: unsafe at t in [43,45] and [52,54]\nFreeway5: unsafe at t=40 and t=44 -> but note: t=40 is the start and we are not on freeway5 at t=40? and we are starting at t=40 at y=0. But we might be on freeway5 at a later time? So unsafe at t=44? and also at t=40? but we don't care about t=40 for freeway5 because we are at y=0 at t=40. So for freeway5: unsafe at t=44? and safe at t=41,42,43,45,46,...\n  Actually, we saw: \n      t=40: unsafe (but we don't use freeway5 at t=40 because we start at y=0)\n      t=41,42,43: safe\n      t=44: unsafe\n      t>=45: safe\n\nSimilarly for freeways 6,7,8: same as freeway5.\n\nNow, we are ready to do BFS.\n\nWe start at (t=40, y=0, actions=[]). We want to get to y=9.\n\nWe'll consider the actions: U, D, S.\n\nFrom (40,0):\n  U: next_y = 1, next_t=41 -> we are at freeway1 at t=41 -> check freeway1 at t=41: safe? (since freeway1 unsafe only at [56,59]) -> safe. So state (41,1, ['U'])\n  D: next_y=0 -> safe -> state (41,0, ['D']) -> but we can also do S to stay at 0 -> same as D? Actually, D and S both lead to y=0 at next_t=41.\n\nSo we have two states: (41,1) and (41,0).\n\nWe'll do BFS by increasing time.\n\nWe'll use a queue and we stop when we first reach y=9.\n\nLet me build a table:\n\nTime 40: (0,0) -> initial.\n\nTime 41: \n  From (40,0): \n      U -> (41,1) -> safe? freeway1 at t=41: safe -> add.\n      D -> (41,0) -> safe (y=0) -> add.\n      S -> (41,0) -> same as D? So we have two ways to get to (41,0): by D or by S? But the action is different. However, the state is (t,y) and we don't care how we got there? Actually, we do care about the path? But for minimal H, we are doing BFS by time, so the first time we get to (t,y) is the minimal? But we are expanding by time: at time 41 we have two states: (1,0) and (1,1). \n\n  However, if we get to (41,0) by two different actions, the path length is the same (1 step). But the action sequence is different. But we only need one minimal path. So we can store the state (t,y) and the path to get there? But we want the minimal H and the sequence. \n\n  Since we are doing BFS by time (each time step we go to the next time), the first time we get to y=9 is the minimal. And we can store the action sequence.\n\n  We can mark (t,y) as visited at time t? But we might get to the same (t,y) by multiple paths? But we want the minimal H, so we only need one path. And BFS by time: we are visiting states at time t in increasing t. So we can store the state (t,y) and the path to get there? But we don't want to store multiple paths for the same (t,y) because we are doing BFS and the first time we get to (t,y) is the one with minimal steps? Actually, the steps are the same: t-40 steps. So we can store the state (t,y) and the path? But if we get to (t,y) by two different sequences, we only need one? \n\n  However, the actions might be different and might lead to different future paths? But the state (t,y) is the same. So we only need to visit each (t,y) once? Because the future evolution depends only on (t,y). \n\n  Therefore, we can use a visited set: states (t,y) that we have already expanded? Then we skip if we see the same (t,y) again? \n\n  But note: we might get to (t,y) by two different paths? But if we already expanded (t,y) then we don't need to do it again? \n\n  However, what if we get to (t,y) by two different paths and then from there we go to different places? But the state (t,y) is the same and the future car positions are deterministic and time-dependent? So the future is the same. \n\n  Therefore, we can use a visited set: (t,y) and we mark as visited when we first get to (t,y). \n\n  But note: we might get to the same y at a later time? That is a different state (t different). So we don't mark (y) only, we mark (t,y).\n\n  We'll do:\n\n      visited = set() \n      Queue: states (t, y, actions)\n\n      Start: (40,0, []) -> visited.add((40,0))\n\n      Then for each neighbor (t+1, y') that is safe and not visited, we add.\n\nLet me simulate:\n\nTime 40: \n  state: (40,0, [])\n\nTime 41:\n  From (40,0):\n      U -> (41,1) -> safe -> visited.add((41,1)) -> state: (41,1, ['U'])\n      D -> (41,0) -> safe -> visited.add((41,0)) -> state: (41,0, ['D'])\n      S -> (41,0) -> already in visited? so skip? But we have two ways: ['D'] and ['S']? But we only need one? And the minimal H doesn't care about which action we take at time40 as long as we get to the goal in minimal steps? However, we are storing the action sequence. But we don't care about the action at time40 if we are going to the same state? \n\n  But note: the problem asks for a sequence. We can choose either. So we can choose the first one we find? \n\n  However, we want minimal H, and the path from (41,0) might be longer? So we can keep one representation for (41,0). \n\n  So we'll skip if we have already visited (t,y).\n\nSo at time40, we generate:\n   (41,1, ['U'])\n   (41,0, ['D'])   # we can also have (41,0,['S']) but we skip the second one.\n\nNow, at time41:\n\n  Expand (41,1, ['U']):\n      At (41,1): \n          Actions: U, D, S.\n\n          U: next_y = 2, next_t=42 -> freeway2 at t=42 -> check: freeway2 unsafe only at [56,59] -> safe -> state (42,2, ['U','U'])\n          D: next_y=0 -> safe -> state (42,0, ['U','D'])\n          S: next_y=1 -> freeway1 at t=42 -> safe -> state (42,1, ['U','S'])\n\n  Expand (41,0, ['D']):\n      Actions: U, D, S.\n          U: (42,1) -> freeway1 at t=42 -> safe -> but we already have (42,1) from above? So skip? \n          D: (42,0) -> safe -> but (42,0) not visited? -> add: (42,0, ['D','D'])\n          S: (42,0) -> same as D? -> skip.\n\nSo now at time42, we have:\n   (42,2, ['U','U'])\n   (42,0, ['U','D'])\n   (42,1, ['U','S'])\n   (42,0, ['D','D']) -> but we skip because when we generate (42,0) from (41,0) by D, we add it and mark (42,0) visited. Then if we generate by S, we skip.\n\nBut we have two different paths to (42,0): \n   ['U','D'] and ['D','D']? \nBut we only keep one? The first one we generated: from (41,1) by D: we generated (42,0, ['U','D']) and then from (41,0) by D: we generated (42,0, ['D','D']). We mark (42,0) as visited after the first one? \n\nBut we do:\n\n   When we generate (42,0) from (41,1): \n        check visited: (42,0) not visited -> add and mark visited.\n\n   Then when we generate (42,0) from (41,0): \n        visited? yes -> skip.\n\nSo we only keep the first path to (42,0): ['U','D'].\n\nBut is that the minimal? We don't know. But the goal is to minimize H, the total number of turns. And we are doing BFS by time: we are expanding by increasing time. So we are visiting states at time t in increasing t. Therefore, the first time we get to (t,y) is the one with minimal t? But note: we are not going backwards in y? We are moving forward in time. So the first time we get to (t,y) is the minimal t for that state? \n\nBut we are expanding by time: we do time 40, then 41, then 42, etc. So the first time we get to a state (t,y) we have the minimal t? Actually, no: because we might get to (t,y) at time t by multiple paths? But the t is fixed. \n\nActually, the state (t,y) is uniquely determined by t and y. So if we get to (t,y) by two different paths, then we only need to expand it once.\n\nTherefore, we use a visited set for (t,y).\n\nNow, we continue until we get to y=9.\n\nWe'll write a BFS.\n\nBut note: we might have to go beyond t=60? \n\nWe'll code the BFS and precompute the unsafe times for each freeway? Or we can compute on the fly with the helper function.\n\nLet me write the helper function:\n\n  def is_safe(t, y):\n      if y==0 or y==9:\n          return True\n      # get the cars for freeway y\n      cars = freeways[y]\n      for car in cars:\n          h, tau, d, s = car\n          dt = t - 40\n          if d == 'right':\n              left_end = tau + s * dt\n              right_end = h + s * dt\n              if left_end <= 0 <= right_end:\n                  return False\n          # if we had left, we would do else, but all are right.\n      return True\n\nBut note: the freeways are indexed by k from 1 to 8.\n\nWe have the freeway data as:\n\nfreeways = {\n  1: [ (-48, -59, 'right', 3) ],\n  2: [ (-48, -59, 'right', 3) ],\n  3: [ (-48, -59, 'right', 3) ],\n  4: [ (-48, -59, 'right', 4), (-12, -23, 'right', 4), (24, 13, 'right', 4) ],\n  5: [ (-48, -59, 'right', 12), (0, -11, 'right', 12) ],\n  6: [ (-48, -59, 'right', 12), (0, -11, 'right', 12) ],\n  7: [ (-48, -59, 'right', 12), (0, -11, 'right', 12) ],\n  8: [ (-48, -59, 'right', 12), (0, -11, 'right', 12) ]\n}\n\nNote: the car in freeway4: (24,13,...) -> we have to be careful: the head is 24 and tail is 13? Then for a right car, the span is [tail, head] = [13,24]. So we do left_end = 13, right_end=24.\n\nBut in the data, we stored (head, tail) as (24,13) -> so in the tuple: (h,tau) = (24,13) -> then we do:\n   left_end = tau + s*dt = 13 + 4*dt\n   right_end = h + s*dt = 24 + 4*dt\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, we code the BFS.\n\nWe'll use a queue: collections.deque.\n\nWe start at (40,0, [])\n\nThen while queue:\n   pop state (t, y, actions)\n   if y==9: return (actions, H=len(actions))? Actually, the number of actions is the number of turns? But we start at turn40, then we do an action to get to turn41, so H = number of actions? and we want to get to (0,9) at the last action.\n\n   Then for action in ['U','D','S']:\n        next_t = t+1\n        if action=='U': next_y = min(9, y+1)\n        if action=='D': next_y = max(0, y-1)\n        if action=='S': next_y = y\n\n        if next_y in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]:\n            if not is_safe(next_t, next_y): \n                skip\n        # else: safe (if next_y==0 or 9)\n\n        Then check if (next_t, next_y) is in visited? if not, add to queue.\n\nWe'll break when we get to next_y==9.\n\nBut note: when we get to (t,9) for the first time, we return the actions.\n\nWe'll do:\n\n  visited = set()\n  from collections import deque\n  queue = deque()\n  start = (40, 0, [])\n  visited.add((40,0))\n  queue.append(start)\n\n  while queue:\n      t, y, actions = queue.popleft()\n      if y == 9:\n          # we are done\n          return actions\n\n      for a in ['U','D','S']:\n          if a=='U':\n              ny = y+1\n              if ny>9: ny=9\n          elif a=='D':\n              ny = y-1\n              if ny<0: ny=0\n          else: # S\n              ny = y\n\n          nt = t+1\n\n          # Check safety: if ny in [1,8] then check, else safe.\n          if ny in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]:\n              if not is_safe(nt, ny):\n                  continue   # skip this action\n\n          # If we are going to a safe state, then check visited\n          if (nt, ny) in visited:\n              continue\n          visited.add((nt,ny))\n\n          new_actions = actions + [a]\n          queue.append( (nt, ny, new_actions) )\n\n  If we break, we return the actions.\n\nBut note: we must get to 9 eventually? \n\nWe know that freeways 5-8 are safe after t=44? so at t=45, we can go through them.\n\nWe start at 0. We have to go through 1,2,...,8.\n\nThe minimal steps without waiting: 9 steps (all U). But we might have to wait at 0 to avoid a freeway that is unsafe at the time we would be there.\n\nFor example, if we go straight up:\n\n  Turn40: y0=0 -> action U -> turn41: y=1 -> safe? yes (freeway1 safe at t=41)\n  Turn41: y=1 -> action U -> turn42: y=2 -> safe? freeway2 at t=42: safe -> yes.\n  Turn42: y=2 -> U -> turn43: y=3 -> freeway3 at t=43: safe -> yes.\n  Turn43: y=3 -> U -> turn44: y=4 -> freeway4 at t=44: unsafe? freeway4 at t=44: unsafe? \n\n      freeway4: unsafe at t in [43,45] and [52,54]. So t=44 is in [43,45] -> unsafe.\n\n  So we cannot do U at turn43 to go to y=4 at t=44.\n\nTherefore, we have to avoid freeway4 at t=44.\n\nWe might wait at y=3 for one turn? \n\n  At turn43: at y=3, we can do S: then at turn44: y=3 -> freeway3 at t=44: safe? freeway3 unsafe only at [56,59] -> safe.\n\n  Then at turn44: we are at y=3 -> then we can do U at turn44 to go to y=4 at turn45: freeway4 at t=45: unsafe? freeway4 unsafe at [43,45] -> t=45 is in [43,45] -> unsafe? \n\n      Actually, t=45: freeway4: car2: unsafe? we computed: car2: unsafe at t=45? \n          car2: at t=45: tail_t=-23+4*(5)= -23+20=-3, head_t=-12+20=8 -> so [ -3,8] -> 0 is in -> unsafe.\n\n  So at t=45, freeway4 is unsafe.\n\n  Then we have to wait again? \n\n  Then at turn44: we are at y=3, we do S again? then at turn45: y=3 -> safe? freeway3 at t=45: safe.\n\n  Then at turn45: we do U: y=4 at turn46: freeway4 at t=46: safe? because t=46: freeway4: car1: safe (t=46<52), car2: safe (t=46>45 -> safe), car3: always safe -> so freeway4 safe at t=46.\n\n  So we can go to y=4 at t=46.\n\nThen we can continue:\n\n  turn46: y=4 -> then U to y=5 at turn47: freeway5 at t=47: safe? (freeway5 unsafe at t=44 and t=40 -> safe) -> yes.\n  then to y=6 at turn48: freeway6 at t=48: safe? same as freeway5 -> safe.\n  then to y=7 at turn49: safe.\n  then to y=8 at turn50: safe? freeway8 at t=50: safe? yes.\n  then to y=9 at turn51.\n\nTotal turns: from turn40 to turn51 -> 11 turns? \n\nBut we started at turn40, then we did 11 actions: from turn40 to turn50? and then at turn51 we are at y=9? \n\nThe number of actions is the number of turns from t1? So we do actions at turn40,41,...,50 -> 11 actions.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? \n\nAlternatively, we might go faster through the freeways? \n\nBut freeway4 is unsafe at t=44 and t=45? so we have to wait at y=3 for two turns? \n\nWe could avoid freeway4 by going up earlier? \n\nBut we start at t=40: \n  We go up: \n      t41: y=1\n      t42: y=2\n      t43: y=3\n      then we have to wait at y=3 for two turns (t44, t45) -> then at t46: y=4, then we can go up each turn: t47:y=5, t48:y=6, t49:y=7, t50:y=8, t51:y=9 -> 11 actions.\n\nCan we go down to 0 and wait? \n\n  For example, at turn43: we are at y=3, instead of staying we go down to y=2? \n      Then at turn44: y=2 -> safe? freeway2 at t=44: safe? (unsafe only at [56,59]) -> safe.\n      Then at turn44: we can go down to y=1? or stay? or up? \n\n  But if we go up at turn44: to y=3? then at turn45: we are at y=3 -> safe? then at turn45: we go up to y=4 -> unsafe? \n\n  Or we wait at y=2 for two turns? then at turn45: still at y=2 -> then at turn46: go up to y=3, then at turn47: to y=4? \n\n  That would be: \n      t40:0 -> t41:1, t42:2, t43:3, t44:2, t45:2 (stay), t46:3, t47:4, t48:5, t49:6, t50:7, t51:8, t52:9 -> 12 actions -> worse.\n\nSo the previous 11 actions might be minimal.\n\nBut we also have freeways 5-8: we can go through them at any time except t=44? but we are going through freeway5 at t=47, which is safe.\n\nIs there a way to get to 9 in 10 actions? \n\n  We need to be at y=9 at turn50? (because 40+10-1=49? wait: \n\n      We do actions at turn40, turn41, ... turn40+H-1 -> so after H actions, we are at turn40+H-1.\n\n      We require y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n      So if H=10, then we are at turn40+9=49.\n\n      So we must be at y=9 at turn49.\n\n      How? \n        We start at turn40: y0=0.\n        We have 9 moves? But we must cover 9 levels: 0->1->...->9 -> 9 moves? but that would be at turn40+9-1 = 48? \n\n        Actually: \n          turn40: y=0 (after 0 actions)\n          turn41: after 1 action -> y=?\n          ...\n          turn40+9: after 9 actions -> y=?\n\n        To get to y=9, we need at least 9 moves (U 9 times). Then we would be at turn40+9 = 49? \n\n        So minimal H=9? \n\n        But can we do 9 actions? \n\n        Then we would be at turn49 at y=9.\n\n        The path: \n          turn40: U -> y=1 at t41\n          turn41: U -> y=2 at t42\n          turn42: U -> y=3 at t43\n          turn43: U -> y=4 at t44 -> but freeway4 at t44: unsafe -> collision.\n\n        So we cannot.\n\n        Then we have to avoid freeway4 at t44. \n\n        How about if we wait at 0 for one turn? \n          turn40: S -> y=0 at t41\n          turn41: U -> y=1 at t42\n          turn42: U -> y=2 at t43\n          turn43: U -> y=3 at t44 -> safe? freeway3 at t44: safe.\n          turn44: U -> y=4 at t45 -> freeway4 at t45: unsafe -> collision.\n\n        Or wait at 0 for two turns? \n          turn40: S -> y=0 at t41\n          turn41: S -> y=0 at t42\n          turn42: U -> y=1 at t43\n          turn43: U -> y=2 at t44\n          turn44: U -> y=3 at t45 -> safe? freeway3 at t45: safe.\n          turn45: U -> y=4 at t46 -> freeway4 at t46: safe.\n          turn46: U -> y=5 at t47: freeway5 at t47: safe.\n          turn47: U -> y=6 at t48: safe.\n          turn48: U -> y=7 at t49: safe.\n          turn49: U -> y=8 at t50: safe.\n          turn50: U -> y=9 at t51 -> then we are at y=9 at turn51 -> 11 actions.\n\n        How about if we go faster through the lower freeways? \n\n        But we have to go through 9 levels.\n\n        Alternatively, we might go down? but that doesn't help.\n\n        So minimal H is 11?\n\n        But wait: we have freeways 5-8 unsafe at t=44? but we are going through freeway5 at t47, which is safe.\n\n        And freeway4 we go at t46, safe.\n\n        So 11 actions: \n          actions: \n            turn40: U\n            turn41: U\n            turn42: U\n            turn43: S   # wait at y=3\n            turn44: S   # wait at y=3\n            turn45: U   # to y=4 at t46\n            turn46: U   # to y=5 at t47\n            turn47: U   # to y=6 at t48\n            turn48: U   # to y=7 at t49\n            turn49: U   # to y=8 at t50\n            turn50: U   # to y=9 at t51\n\n        Then at turn51 we are at y=9.\n\n        So H=11.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we are to provide the sequence.\n\n        However, we might find a path that uses 10 actions? \n\n        How? \n          We start at 0, we need to be at 9 at turn49 (after 10 actions: from 40 to 49, 10 steps? actually 10 actions: turn40 to turn49 -> 10 states: 40 (initial) and then 10 actions: 41..49 -> 10 actions).\n\n          But we must cover 9 levels. So we must move up 9 times and one wait? \n\n          For example: 9 U and 1 S -> 10 actions.\n\n          But we have to avoid freeway4 at t44 and t45? \n\n          How about:\n\n            turn40: U -> t41:1\n            turn41: U -> t42:2\n            turn42: U -> t43:3\n            turn43: S -> t44:3 (safe) \n            turn44: U -> t45:4 -> unsafe at freeway4 at t45 -> collision.\n\n          How about:\n\n            turn40: U -> t41:1\n            turn41: U -> t42:2\n            turn42: U -> t43:3\n            turn43: U -> t44:4 -> unsafe.\n\n          How about:\n\n            turn40: S -> t41:0\n            turn41: U -> t42:1\n            turn42: U -> t43:2\n            turn43: U -> t44:3 -> safe\n            turn44: U -> t45:4 -> unsafe.\n\n          How about:\n\n            turn40: U -> t41:1\n            turn41: S -> t42:1 -> safe? freeway1 at t42: safe.\n            turn42: U -> t43:2\n            turn43: U -> t44:3\n            turn44: U -> t45:4 -> unsafe.\n\n          How about:\n\n            turn40: U -> t41:1\n            turn41: U -> t42:2\n            turn42: S -> t43:2 -> safe? freeway2 at t43: safe.\n            turn43: U -> t44:3\n            turn44: U -> t45:4 -> unsafe.\n\n          How about:\n\n            turn40: U -> t41:1\n            turn41: U -> t42:2\n            turn42: U -> t43:3\n            turn43: D -> t44:2 -> safe? freeway2 at t44: safe.\n            turn44: U -> t45:3\n            turn45: U -> t46:4 -> safe? freeway4 at t46: safe.\n            then we have 5 more moves: to go from 4 to 9: 5 moves -> total 10 moves? \n                turn46: U->5\n                turn47: U->6\n                turn48: U->7\n                turn49: U->8\n                turn50: U->9 -> but then we are at turn50? which is 10 actions? because started at turn40, then 10 actions: turns40 to 49? and at turn50 we are at 9? \n\n            Actually: \n                actions at turn40,41,...,49 -> 10 actions, then at turn50 we are at y=9.\n\n            So total turns: from turn40 to turn50 -> 10 actions? \n\n            But the problem: we are to reach at turn t1+H-1.

Then we do an action at turn40 to get to turn41. So after k actions, we are at turn40+k.\n\n            We want at turn40+H-1 to be at (0,9). \n\n            Actually, the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and we end at turn t1+H-1.\n\n            So if H=10, then we end at turn40+10-1=49.\n\n            But in the above, we are at y=9 at turn50? which is 40+10? -> that would be H=11? because 40+11-1=50.\n\n            How did we count?\n\n            We have:\n\n              t40: start at 0\n              t40: action1 -> t41: y1\n              t41: action2 -> t42: y2\n              ...\n              t49: action10 -> t50: y10\n\n            So after 10 actions, we are at t50. \n\n            The turn at which we are at (0,9) is t50. \n\n            We require: t1 + H - 1 = 40 + H - 1 = 50 -> so H=11.\n\n            Therefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\n            But the above path we described for 10 actions actually takes 10 actions and ends at turn50? so H=11.\n\n            So the minimal H is 11.\n\n        Therefore, we can output the sequence:\n\n          turn40: U\n          turn41: U\n          turn42: U\n          turn43: D   # from y=3 to y=2 at t44\n          turn44: U   # to y=3 at t45\n          turn45: U   # to y=4 at t46 -> safe\n          turn46: U   # to y=5 at t47\n          turn47: U   # to y=6 at t48\n          turn48: U   # to y=7 at t49\n          turn49: U   # to y=8 at t50\n          turn50: U   # to y=9 at t51 -> but wait, we are at turn51? \n\n          Actually, the actions:\n\n            t40: U -> t41: y=1\n            t41: U -> t42: y=2\n            t42: U -> t43: y=3\n            t43: D -> t44: y=2\n            t44: U -> t45: y=3\n            t45: U -> t46: y=4\n            t46: U -> t47: y=5\n            t47: U -> t48: y=6\n            t48: U -> t49: y=7\n            t49: U -> t50: y=8\n            t50: U -> t51: y=9\n\n          So 11 actions.\n\n        But we have to check safety:\n\n          t41: y=1 -> freeway1 at t41: safe.\n          t42: y=2 -> freeway2 at t42: safe.\n          t43: y=3 -> freeway3 at t43: safe.\n          t44: y=2 -> freeway2 at t44: safe? (freeway2 unsafe only at [56,59]) -> safe.\n          t45: y=3 -> freeway3 at t45: safe.\n          t46: y=4 -> freeway4 at t46: safe? \n                car1: (-48,-59,right,4): at t46: dt=6, left_end=-59+24=-35, right_end=-48+24=-24 -> safe.\n                car2: (-12,-23,right,4): -23+24=1, -12+24=12 -> [1,12] -> safe.\n                car3: (24,13,right,4): 13+24=37, 24+24=48 -> safe.\n          t47: y=5 -> freeway5 at t47: safe? (freeway5 unsafe at t=44 and t=40) -> safe.\n          t48: y=6 -> freeway6: same as 5 -> safe.\n          t49: y=7 -> safe.\n          t50: y=8 -> safe.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        But we have an extra move: we went down and then up. \n\n        Alternatively, we could have stayed at y=3 for two turns:\n\n          t40: U -> t41:1\n          t41: U -> t42:2\n          t42: U -> t43:3\n          t43: S -> t44:3 -> freeway3 at t44: safe.\n          t44: S -> t45:3 -> freeway3 at t45: safe.\n          t45: U -> t46:4 -> safe (as above)\n          then U each turn to 9: \n          t46: U->5\n          t47: U->6\n          t48: U->7\n          t49: U->8\n          t50: U->9\n\n        Total actions: 11.\n\n        Which one is shorter? both 11.\n\n        But the problem: minimal H, and then any sequence. So we can choose.\n\n        However, we might find a sequence that doesn't go down? \n\n        But we have to avoid freeway4 at t44 and t45. So we have to be at a safe freeway at t44 and t45. \n\n        We could go to freeway1,2,3,5,6,7,8 at t44 and t45? \n\n        But we are at y=3 at t43. We can go up to y=4 at t44? unsafe. \n        We can go down to y=2 at t44? safe? freeway2 at t44: safe -> yes.\n\n        Or we can stay at y=3: safe.\n\n        So either way.\n\n        We'll run the BFS to get the minimal path.\n\n        But we know minimal H is 11.\n\n        We'll code the BFS and see what it returns.\n\n        However, we can do:\n\n          We want to be at y=9 at turn50? (since 40+11-1=50) -> so we are at (50,9).\n\n        But we can also get there at turn51? but that would be H=12.\n\n        So we are looking for a path that takes 11 actions.\n\n        We'll run the BFS until we get to y=9.\n\n        I'll simulate manually a bit:\n\n          We have:\n\n          Time40: (0,0)\n\n          Time41: (1, ['U']), (0,['D'])\n\n          Time42: \n             from (41,1): \n                 U: (42,2, ['U','U'])\n                 D: (42,0, ['U','D'])\n                 S: (42,1, ['U','S'])\n             from (41,0): \n                 U: (42,1) -> skip because we have (42,1) already?\n                 D: (42,0) -> skip\n                 S: skip\n\n          Time43:\n             from (42,2): \n                 U: (43,3, ['U','U','U']) -> safe? freeway3 at t43: safe -> add.\n                 D: (43,1, ['U','U','D']) -> freeway1 at t43: safe -> add.\n                 S: (43,2, ['U','U','S']) -> freeway2 at t43: safe -> add.\n             from (42,0): \n                 U: (43,1) -> skip\n                 D: skip\n                 S: skip\n             from (42,1): \n                 U: (43,2) -> skip? (already have (43,2) from above? no, we have (43,2) from (42,2) by S? but we generated (43,2) by ['U','U','S'] -> then we also might generate from (42,1) by U: (43,2, ['U','S','U'])? but we skip because (43,2) is visited? \n\n          So we have at time43: \n              (43,3, ['U','U','U'])\n              (43,1, ['U','U','D'])\n              (43,2, ['U','U','S'])\n\n          Time44:\n             from (43,3):\n                 U: (44,4) -> unsafe -> skip.\n                 D: (44,2) -> freeway2 at t44: safe -> add: (44,2, ['U','U','U','D'])\n                 S: (44,3) -> freeway3 at t44: safe -> add: (44,3, ['U','U','U','S'])\n             from (43,1):\n                 U: (44,2) -> safe? -> but (44,2) is already being added? we skip if we get it again? \n                 D: (44,0) -> add: (44,0, ['U','U','D','D'])\n                 S: (44,1) -> freeway1 at t44: safe -> add: (44,1, ['U','U','D','S'])\n             from (43,2):\n                 U: (44,3) -> already added? skip.\n                 D: (44,1) -> skip? because we are about to add (44,1) from (43,1) by U? but we already have (44,1) from (43,1) by S? no, we have (44,1) by ['U','U','D','S'] and we are generating by D: (44,1, ['U','U','S','D'])? -> different path, but same state -> skip.\n                 S: (44,2) -> already added.\n\n          Then at time44: we have:\n              (44,2, ['U','U','U','D'])\n              (44,3, ['U','U','U','S'])\n              (44,0, ['U','U','D','D'])\n              (44,1, ['U','U','D','S'])\n\n          Then we continue...\n\n          We see we have a state (44,3) by staying.\n\n          Then at time45: from (44,3):\n                 U: (45,4) -> unsafe -> skip.\n                 D: (45,2) -> freeway2 at t45: safe -> add: (45,2, ['U','U','U','S','D'])\n                 S: (45,3) -> freeway3 at t45: safe -> add: (45,3, ['U','U','U','S','S'])\n\n          Then at time46: from (45,3): \n                 U: (46,4) -> safe -> add: (46,4, ['U','U','U','S','S','U'])\n\n          Then from (46,4): we can go up each turn until 9:\n\n          turn46: y=4 -> action U: turn47: y=5 -> safe\n          turn47: U: y=6 -> safe\n          turn48: U: y=7 -> safe\n          turn49: U: y=8 -> safe\n          turn50: U: y=9 -> goal.\n\n          So the sequence: \n            turn40: U\n            turn41: U\n            turn42: U\n            turn43: S\n            turn44: S\n            turn45: S   # wait, but at time45 we did S? but we have two ways: we did S at turn44 and then at turn45 we did S again? \n\n          Actually, the path: \n            actions: ['U','U','U','S','S','U','U','U','U','U'] -> 10 actions? \n            But we need to get to y=9 at turn50? which would be after 10 actions? \n            How many actions: 10 actions: from turn40 to turn49? then at turn50 we are at y=9? \n\n            But the last action is at turn49: U -> from y=8 to y=9 at turn50.\n\n            But the problem: we start at turn40. The actions are at turn40,41,...,49 -> 10 actions. Then at turn50 we are at y=9.\n\n            How many turns H? The problem: we have H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1. So H=10? but then we end at turn40+10-1=49? but we are at y=9 at turn50.\n\n            So we need 11 actions: \n               actions at turn40 to turn50: 11 actions, then at turn51 we are at y=9.\n\n            But in the above, we have 10 actions and we are at y=9 at turn50? \n\n            We start at turn40: state (0,0)\n            After 1 action (turn40): we are at turn41 at y=1.\n            After 2 actions: turn42, y=2.\n            ...\n            After 6 actions: turn45: y=3 -> then at turn46: after 6 actions? we are at y=4? \n            Then 7: turn47: y=5\n            ... \n            After 10 actions: turn49: y=8? \n            Then we need an 11th action: at turn49: U -> to y=9 at turn50.\n\n            So the sequence has 11 actions.\n\n            The actions: \n               0: U (at turn40) -> y1=1 at t41\n               1: U (t41) -> y2=2 at t42\n               2: U (t42) -> y3=3 at t43\n               3: S (t43) -> y4=3 at t44\n               4: S (t44) -> y5=3 at t45\n               5: U (t45) -> y6=4 at t46\n               6: U (t46) -> y7=5 at t47\n               7: U (t47) -> y8=6 at t48\n               8: U (t48) -> y9=7 at t49\n               9: U (t49) -> y10=8 at t50\n               10: U (t50) -> y11=9 at t51\n\n            But wait, that's 11 actions.\n\n            But in the BFS we had: \n                (46,4) is after 5 actions? \n                  actions: ['U','U','U','S','S'] -> 5 actions, at turn45? no: \n                    turn40: action0: U -> t41:1\n                    turn41: action1: U -> t42:2\n                    turn42: action2: U -> t43:3\n                    turn43: action3: S -> t44:3\n                    turn44: action4: S -> t45:3\n                    turn45: action5: U -> t46:4\n\n                Then we need 5 more actions to go from 4 to 9: \n                    action6: U (t46) -> t47:5\n                    action7: U (t47) -> t48:6\n                    action8: U (t48) -> t49:7\n                    action9: U (t49) -> t50:8\n                    action10: U (t50) -> t51:9\n\n                So 11 actions.\n\n            Therefore, the sequence is:\n\n                turn40: U\n                turn41: U\n                turn42: U\n                turn43: S\n                turn44: S\n                turn45: U\n                turn46: U\n                turn47: U\n                turn48: U\n                turn49: U\n                turn50: U\n\n            And we are at (0,9) at turn51.\n\n        We can output that.\n\n        But is there a sequence with 11 actions that doesn't use two waits? \n\n        For example, the one with a down:\n\n          turn40: U\n          turn41: U\n          turn42: U\n          turn43: D   -> y=2 at t44\n          turn44: U   -> y=3 at t45\n          turn45: U   -> y=4 at t46\n          then same as above: 7 U's to 9? -> but from y=4 at t46 to y=9 at t51: that's 5 U's: \n                t46:4 -> t47:5, t48:6, t49:7, t50:8, t51:9 -> so 5 actions from t46 to t50? \n          total actions: \n             t40:U, t41:U, t42:U, t43:D, t44:U, t45:U, t46:U, t47:U, t48:U, t49:U, t50:U -> 11 actions.\n\n        So we can have:\n\n          turn40: U\n          turn41: U\n          turn42: U\n          turn43: D\n          turn44: U\n          turn45: U\n          turn46: U\n          turn47: U\n          turn48: U\n          turn49: U\n          turn50: U\n\n        And we are at y=9 at turn51.\n\n        We can choose either.\n\n        We'll output the first one we find? \n\n        But the BFS will find the minimal H and the first path to get there.\n\n        Given the time, we can trust the BFS.\n\n        We'll run the BFS in code? but we are not coding, so we output one.\n\n        Let's output the one with two S's at y=3.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns\", and both are 11.\n\n        We choose:\n\n          Turn t_1: U\n          Turn t_1+1: U\n          Turn t_1+2: U\n          Turn t_1+3: S\n          Turn t_1+4: S\n          Turn t_1+5: U\n          Turn t_1+6: U\n          Turn t_1+7: U\n          Turn t_1+8: U\n          Turn t_1+9: U\n          Turn t_1+10: U\n\n        But t1=40, so:\n\n          Turn40: U\n          Turn41: U\n          Turn42: U\n          Turn43: S\n          Turn44: S\n          Turn45: U\n          Turn46: U\n          Turn47: U\n          Turn48: U\n          Turn49: U\n          Turn50: U\n\n        And we are at (0,9) at turn51.\n\n        But the last action is at turn50, and then we are at turn51 at y=9.\n\n        And the sequence has 11 actions.\n\n        So H=11.\n\n        We output:\n\n          Turn40: U\n          Turn41: U\n          Turn42: U\n          Turn43: S\n          Turn44: S\n          Turn45: U\n          Turn46: U\n          Turn47: U\n          Turn48: U\n          Turn49: U\n          Turn50: U\n\n        But note: the answer format: \n\n          \\boxed{\n            Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n            Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n            ...\n          }\n\n        Here t1=40, so:\n\n          Turn40: U\n          Turn41: U\n          Turn42: U\n          Turn43: S\n          Turn44: S\n          Turn45: U\n          Turn46: U\n          Turn47: U\n          Turn48: U\n          Turn49: U\n          Turn50: U\n\n        This is 11 lines.\n\n        We are done.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 40\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by waiting at \\(y = 3\\) for two turns to avoid unsafe conditions on freeway 4 at turns 44 and 45. The path is as follows:\n\n- At turn 40, move up to \\(y = 1\\) (safe, as freeway 1 is safe at turn 41).\n- At turn 41, move up to \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as freeway 2 is safe at turn 42).\n- At turn 42, move up to \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as freeway 3 is safe at turn 43).\n- At turn 43, stay at \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as freeway 3 is safe at turn 44).\n- At turn 44, stay at \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as freeway 3 is safe at turn 45).\n- At turn 45, move up to \\(y = 4\\) (safe, as freeway 4 is safe at turn 46).\n- At turn 46, move up to \\(y = 5\\) (safe, as freeway 5 is safe at turn 47).\n- At turn 47, move up to \\(y = 6\\) (safe, as freeway 6 is safe at turn 48).\n- At turn 48, move up to \\(y = 7\\) (safe, as freeway 7 is safe at turn 49).\n- At turn 49, move up to \\(y = 8\\) (safe, as freeway 8 is safe at turn 50).\n- At turn 50, move up to \\(y = 9\\) (goal reached at turn 51).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) in 11 turns without collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 40: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 41: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 42: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 43: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 44: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 45: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 46: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 47: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 48: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 49: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 50: \\text{ U}\n}",

The player moves up, down, or stays, and cars move left or right with constant speed.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each future turn. Since the current turn is t₁=43, I need to find the positions of the cars at turns T > 43.\n\nThe collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where y_T is between 1 and 8, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn. The player is on y_t at turn t, and the collision check is for that specific y at turn t.\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn T, if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, you're not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you only care about the freeway you're currently on for collision.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars there, and we start from y=3.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nNow, let's list the car states for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (-39,-50, right, 3)\n\nSince it's right-moving, span at t is [τ + s(t - t₁), h + s(t - t₁)]? Let's see the update.\n\nFrom the rule:\n\nRight-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, head is larger, I think.\n\nFor freeway 1: (-39, -50, right, 3). -50 to -39, so tail is -50, head is -39? But -39 > -50, so if right-moving, it should be moving to increasing x, so head is larger.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume.\n\nHere, tail is -50, head is -39, so τ = -50, h = -39.\n\nSo at T, span is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] = [-50 + 3(T-43), -39 + 3(T-43)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nt₁=43.\n\nSo for freeway 1:\n\nSpan at T: [-50 + 3(T-43), -39 + 3(T-43)]\n\nCollision if player is on y=1 at turn T and 0 in this span.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-39,-50,right,3), identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-39,-50,right,3)\n\nAll three are the same? Freeway 1,2,3 each have one car with same parameters.\n\nThen freeway 4: three cars: (-36,-47,right,4), (0,-11,right,4), (36,25,right,4)\n\nFor each car, separately.\n\nFirst car: tail τ=-47, head h=-36, right, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [-47 + 4(T-43), -36 + 4(T-43)]\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,4), so τ=-11, h=0? Head is 0, tail is -11.\n\nSince right, τ=-11, h=0.\n\nSpan: [-11 + 4(T-43), 0 + 4(T-43)] = [-11 +4(T-43), 4(T-43)]\n\nThird car: (36,25,right,4), head=36, tail=25? 36>25, so τ=25, h=36\n\nSpan: [25 +4(T-43), 36 +4(T-43)]\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars: (-12,-23,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,12), head=-12, tail=-23? -12 > -23, so τ=-23, h=-12\n\nSpan: [-23 +12(T-43), -12 +12(T-43)]\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,12), τ=25, h=36\n\nSpan: [25 +12(T-43), 36 +12(T-43)]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5? (-12,-23,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n\nIdentical.\n\nFreeway 7: same.\n\nFreeway 8: same.\n\nSo freeways 5,6,7,8 all have the same two cars.\n\nNow, I need to find when these spans cover 0 for each freeway at each turn.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, I need to avoid being on a freeway when 0 is in any car's span on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, the player starts at y=3 at turn 43.\n\nI need to reach y=9, so I have to go up, since 3 to 9, difference 6, so minimum 6 turns if I go up every turn, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, but since I have to go up, probably not down, but I might stay or something.\n\ny=9 is the target, and it's safe.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway, at which turns T, there is a car with 0 in span, meaning collision if on that freeway.\n\nFirst, for freeway y=1:\n\nCar: span [ -50 +3(T-43), -39 +3(T-43) ]\n\nSet 0 in [A,B] where A= -50 +3(T-43), B= -39 +3(T-43)\n\nSo A ≤ 0 ≤ B\n\n-50 +3(T-43) ≤ 0 ≤ -39 +3(T-43)\n\nFirst inequality: -50 +3(T-43) ≤ 0 => 3(T-43) ≤ 50 => T-43 ≤ 50/3 ≈ 16.666, so T ≤ 43 + 16 = 59? 50/3=16.666, so T-43 ≤ 16.666, T ≤ 59.666, since T integer, T ≤ 59\n\nT-43 ≤ 50/3 ≈ 16.666, so T ≤ 43 + 16 = 59? 43 + 16.666 = 59.666, so T ≤ 59 since T integer? Let's see.\n\n3(T-43) ≤ 50, T-43 ≤ 50/3 = 16 + 2/3, so T-43 ≤ 16 since integer? No, inequality.\n\nT-43 ≤ floor(50/3) but better to keep fraction.\n\n3(T-43) ≤ 50, so T-43 ≤ 50/3 = 16.666, so T ≤ 43 + 16.666 = 59.666, since T integer, T ≤ 59.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 ≤ -39 +3(T-43) => 39 ≤ 3(T-43) => 13 ≤ T-43 => T ≥ 43 + 13 = 56\n\nSo T ≥ 56 and T ≤ 59\n\nFrom 0 ≤ -39 +3(T-43) => 3(T-43) ≥ 39 => T-43 ≥ 13 => T ≥ 56\n\nAnd from first, T ≤ 59.666, so T ≤ 59\n\nThus for freeway 1, collision if on it at T for T=56,57,58,59\n\nT from 56 to 59 inclusive.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, so also T=56 to 59\n\nFreeway 3: same, T=56 to 59\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,4), span [ -47 +4(T-43), -36 +4(T-43) ]\n\nSet 0 in this: -47 +4(T-43) ≤ 0 ≤ -36 +4(T-43)\n\nFirst: -47 +4(T-43) ≤ 0 => 4(T-43) ≤ 47 => T-43 ≤ 47/4 = 11.75, T ≤ 43 + 11.75 = 54.75, so T ≤ 54\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -36 +4(T-43) => 36 ≤ 4(T-43) => 9 ≤ T-43 => T ≥ 52\n\nBut T ≤ 54 and T ≥ 52? From above.\n\nT ≥ 52 and T ≤ 54? But T-43 ≥ 9, T ≥ 52, T-43 ≤ 11.75, T ≤ 54.75, so T=52,53,54\n\nBut this is for the first car.\n\nNow second car on freeway 4: (0,-11,right,4), span [ -11 +4(T-43), 0 +4(T-43) ] = [ -11 +4(T-43), 4(T-43) ]\n\nSet 0 in this.\n\nA = -11 +4(T-43), B=4(T-43)\n\nA ≤ 0 ≤ B\n\nSince B = 4(T-43) ≥ 0 for T≥43, so 0 ≤ B always true for T≥43.\n\nA ≤ 0: -11 +4(T-43) ≤ 0 => 4(T-43) ≤ 11 => T-43 ≤ 11/4 = 2.75, T ≤ 43 + 2.75 = 45.75, so T ≤ 45\n\nThus for this car, 0 in span when T ≤ 45, and since T≥43, T=43,44,45\n\nNow third car on freeway 4: (36,25,right,4), span [25 +4(T-43), 36 +4(T-43)]\n\nNow A =25 +4(T-43) >0 for T≥43, since min at T=43, A=25>0, so 0 < A ≤ B, so 0 not in [A,B] since A>0.\n\nThus for freeway 4, collisions when:\n\n- From first car: T=52,53,54\n\n- From second car: T=43,44,45\n\n- Third car: never\n\nSo overall for freeway 4, collision at T=43,44,45,52,53,54\n\nT=43 is current turn, but player is at y=3, not on y=4, so at T=43, if player were on y=4, collision, but player is on y=3, so ok.\n\nBut for future, when player is on y=4.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,12), span [ -23 +12(T-43), -12 +12(T-43) ]\n\nSet 0 in [A,B] with A= -23 +12(T-43), B= -12 +12(T-43)\n\nA ≤ 0 ≤ B\n\nFirst: A ≤ 0 => -23 +12(T-43) ≤ 0 => 12(T-43) ≤ 23 => T-43 ≤ 23/12 ≈ 1.916, T ≤ 44.916, so T ≤ 44\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ B => 0 ≤ -12 +12(T-43) => 12 ≤ 12(T-43) => 1 ≤ T-43 => T ≥ 44\n\nSo T ≥ 44 and T ≤ 44, thus T=44\n\nSimilarly, second car: (36,25,right,12), span [25 +12(T-43), 36 +12(T-43)] >0, so never 0.\n\nThus for freeway 5, collision only at T=44\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5, collision at T=44\n\nFreeway 7: same, T=44\n\nFreeway 8: same, T=44\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, the turns when it is occupied (collision if on it):\n\ny=1: occupied T=56,57,58,59\n\ny=2: same, 56-59\n\ny=3: same, 56-59\n\ny=4: occupied T=43,44,45,52,53,54\n\nBut T=43 is now, player on y=3, not y=4, so for future, we care from T=44 onwards.\n\ny=5: occupied T=44\n\ny=6: T=44\n\ny=7: T=44\n\ny=8: T=44\n\nAlso, for y=4, occupied at 44,45,52,53,54\n\nNow, player starts at T=43, y=3.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nEach action U, D, S changes y by +1, -1, 0.\n\nFrom y=3 to y=9, need +6, so minimum 6 turns if all U.\n\nBut we might need to avoid the occupied times.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nAt turn T, player is at y_T.\n\nWe need to be on y=9 at some turn, and it must be safe, but y=9 has no cars, so always safe.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=43 onwards.\n\nLet me denote the turn from t=43 as time 0 for simplicity, so let τ = T - 43, so τ=0 is current turn.\n\nAt τ=0, y=3.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some τ=H, with actions from τ=0 to τ=H-1, so after H actions, at time τ=H, y= y_0 + sum of Δy.\n\ny at time τ is after τ actions from initial.\n\nAt turn t₁ + t for t=0 to H-1, actions, and position at t₁ + t for t=0 to H? Let's see.\n\nThe player position: at turn t₁, position (0, y_{t₁})\n\nAfter action a_{t₁}, at turn t₁+1, position y_{t₁+1} = y_{t₁} + Δy_{t₁}\n\nThen at turn t₁+2, y_{t₁+2} = y_{t₁+1} + Δy_{t₁+1}, and so on.\n\nSo at turn T = t₁ + k, position y_{T} = y_{t₁} + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} Δy_{t₁ + i}\n\nWith k from 0 to H, but at k=0, y_{t₁}, and at k=H, y_{t₁ + H}\n\nWe need y_{t₁ + H} = 9, and the actions for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nThe minimal H such that we can reach y=9 at turn t₁ + H.\n\nSince we start at y=3, and y=9, we need to increase by 6, so H must be at least 6, and at most, well, we can stay or go down, but that would increase H, so to minimize H, we should not go down or stay unnecessarily, only if needed to avoid collision.\n\nBut we might need to wait on some row.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nAlso, during the path, we need to be on y between 0 and 9, and for y=1 to 8, avoid when occupied.\n\nNow, let's list the occupied times for each y, in terms of τ.\n\nτ = T - t₁ = T - 43\n\nSo for y=1: occupied τ=56-43=13 to 16? τ = T-43.\n\nT=56, τ=13; T=57,τ=14; T=58,τ=15; T=59,τ=16. So τ=13,14,15,16\n\nSimilarly y=2: same, τ=13,14,15,16\n\ny=3: same, τ=13,14,15,16\n\ny=4: occupied at T=43,44,45,52,53,54 so τ=0,1,2,9,10,11\n\nT=43, τ=0; T=44,τ=1; T=45,τ=2; T=52,τ=9; T=53,τ=10; T=54,τ=11\n\ny=5: occupied at T=44, τ=1\n\nSimilarly y=6: τ=1\n\ny=7: τ=1\n\ny=8: τ=1\n\ny=5,6,7,8 all occupied only at τ=1, which is T=44.\n\nNow, player at τ=0, y=3.\n\ny=3 is safe at τ=0, because occupied only from τ=13 onwards, which is later.\n\nAt τ=0, y=3, and y=3 is not occupied until τ=13, so safe.\n\nNow, we need to go up to y=9.\n\nThe critical part is around τ=1, where y=4,5,6,7,8 are all occupied at τ=1 except y=4 is occupied at τ=1, but y=5,6,7,8 are occupied only at τ=1, and y=4 is also occupied at τ=1.\n\ny=4 is occupied at τ=1, and y=5,6,7,8 at τ=1 only.\n\nBut at τ=1, if player is on one of these, collision.\n\nAlso, y=4 is occupied at other times, but for now.\n\nSince we need to move up, let's see possible paths.\n\nFirst, to minimize H, we should go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut at τ=0, y=3.\n\nWe can choose action at τ=0 (turn t₁).\n\nAction a_{t₁} for turn t₁.\n\nIf we go up to y=4 at τ=1.\n\nBut at τ=1, y=4 is occupied, so if we are on y=4 at τ=1, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay, y=3 at τ=1, which is safe.\n\nOr go down to y=2, but y=2 is safe at τ=1, since occupied only later.\n\nBut going down might not help to go up.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nPerhaps we should not be on y=4 at τ=1.\n\nSo at τ=0, we should not go up to y=4 for τ=1.\n\nOptions at τ=0: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, then at τ=1, y=4, which is occupied, collision. Not good.\n\nIf D, to y=2 at τ=1. y=2 is safe at τ=1, since occupied only at τ=13-16.\n\nIf S, stay at y=3 at τ=1, safe.\n\nThen from there, we need to go up.\n\nBut we have to avoid y=4 at τ=1, which we can by not going up at τ=0.\n\nNow, at τ=1, if we are at y=2 or y=3, both safe.\n\nThen we need to go to higher y.\n\nBut y=4 is occupied not only at τ=1, but also at τ=2, and later at τ=9,10,11.\n\nτ=1 and τ=2 for now.\n\nAlso, y=5,6,7,8 are occupied only at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, if we are on y=5,6,7, or 8, collision, but since we start from below, at τ=1 we can be at y=2,3, or if we went down, y=2, or stay y=3.\n\nWe cannot be at y=5 or above at τ=1 from y=3 in one step.\n\nSo at τ=1, possible y positions: if we did U at τ=0, y=4, but collision, invalid.\n\nIf D, y=2; if S, y=3.\n\nSo y=2 or y=3 at τ=1, both safe.\n\nNow from there, we want to go up.\n\nBut at τ=1, if we are at y=2 or y=3, and we want to go to y=4, but at τ=1, y=4 is occupied, so we cannot go to y=4 at τ=1? At τ=1, position is after action or at turn.\n\nAt turn τ=1, which is T=44, if player is on y=4, collision.\n\nBut if we are at y=3 at τ=1, and we take action to go to y=4 at τ=2, but the position at τ=1 is y=3, not on y=4.\n\nThen at τ=1, we take action for τ=2.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T, player is at y_T.\n\nAction a_T is taken, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on y_T.\n\nFor example, at T=t₁=43, τ=0, y=3, not on freeway with issue except y=4 at τ=0, but y=4 at τ=0 is occupied? For y=4, occupied at τ=0, but at τ=0, player is on y=3, not y=4, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, at T=44, τ=1, if player is on y=4, collision, since y=4 occupied at τ=1.\n\nIf player is on y=5, collision, etc.\n\nNow, to reach y=4, we need to be on it at some turn when not occupied.\n\ny=4 occupied at τ=1,2,9,10,11.\n\nSo safe at τ=0,3,4,5,6,7,8,12,... but τ=0 is past, we are at τ=0 on y=3.\n\nτ=0: y=3, not y=4.\n\nWe can be on y=4 at τ=3, for example, since not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7,8 are only occupied at τ=1, so safe at other times.\n\ny=1,2,3 occupied at τ=13-16, but we are going up, so probably not relevant if we go fast.\n\nBut we have to pass through y=4 to y=8.\n\ny=4 has multiple occupied times.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go up as fast as possible, but avoid the occupied times.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=3.\n\nIf we go up at τ=0, to y=4 at τ=1, but at τ=1, y=4 occupied, collision.\n\nSo cannot go up at τ=0.\n\nThus, at τ=0, we must not go up, so either stay or down.\n\nIf stay, at τ=1, y=3.\n\nIf down, at τ=1, y=2.\n\nNow, at τ=1, we are at y=2 or y=3.\n\ny=3 at τ=1 is safe, since occupied only later.\n\ny=2 also safe.\n\nNow, we want to go up.\n\nBut at τ=1, y=4 is occupied, so we cannot move to y=4 at τ=1? Action at τ=1 for position at τ=2.\n\nAt turn τ=1, we are at y_{τ=1}, which is y=2 or 3.\n\nWe take action a_{τ=1}, which sets y_{τ=2}.\n\nIf we take U, then y_{τ=2} = y_{τ=1} +1.\n\nBut at the turn when we are on y, collision is checked at that turn.\n\nFor example, at turn τ=1, if we are on y=4, collision, but if we are on y=3, safe.\n\nThen if we take U at τ=1, we go to y=4 at τ=2.\n\nThen at turn τ=2, we are on y=4, and we need to check if collision at τ=2.\n\nFor y=4, at τ=2, it is occupied (since τ=2 is T=45, occupied), so if on y=4 at τ=2, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we take other actions.\n\nSo to avoid collision at τ=2 for y=4, we cannot be on y=4 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=1, we cannot be on y=4,5,6,7,8, but since we are at y=2 or 3, we are not on them.\n\nSo at τ=1, from y=2 or 3, we can take action.\n\nIf we take U, we go to y= y_{τ=1} +1 at τ=2.\n\nIf y_{τ=1}=2, then y=3 at τ=2.\n\nIf y_{τ=1}=3, then y=4 at τ=2, but y=4 occupied at τ=2, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we take S, y same at τ=2.\n\nIf D, y decrease.\n\nBut we want to go up, so from y=3 at τ=1, if we take U, to y=4 at τ=2, collision.\n\nIf we take S, stay y=3 at τ=2.\n\nOr D, to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nFrom y=2 at τ=1, we can take U to y=3 at τ=2, or S to y=2, or D to y=1.\n\nBut y=1 is safe until τ=13.\n\nBut let's see how to progress.\n\nWe need to get to y=4 when it is safe.\n\ny=4 safe at τ=3,4? τ=3 is T=46, which is not in occupied list for y=4.\n\ny=4 occupied τ=0,1,2,9,10,11.\n\nSo safe at τ=3,4,5,6,7,8,12,etc.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7,8 safe except τ=1.\n\nSo for y=5,6,7,8, only unsafe at τ=1, so we can be on them at other times.\n\ny=4 has more unsafe times.\n\nTo go up fast, we should be on y=4 at some safe time, say τ=3.\n\nFrom current, at τ=0, y=3.\n\nWe cannot go up to y=4 at τ=1 because occupied.\n\nSo we need to stay or go down at τ=0.\n\nSuppose at τ=0, we stay (S), so at τ=1, y=3.\n\nThen at τ=1, we cannot go up to y=4 at τ=2 because y=4 occupied at τ=2.\n\nSo at τ=1, if we are at y=3, we must not go up; we can stay or go down.\n\nIf we go down to y=2 at τ=2, or stay y=3.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nAt τ=1, if we are at y=2 (from down at τ=0), then at τ=1 y=2.\n\nThen at τ=1, we can go up to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nSince y=3 at τ=2 is safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=3, we can go up to y=4 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=4, is it safe? τ=3, T=46, not occupied for y=4, yes safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up to y=5 at τ=4, and so on.\n\nBut let's list the sequence.\n\nFirst, at τ=0 (turn t₁), action: cannot U, so must S or D.\n\nIf S: at τ=1, y=3.\n\nThen at τ=1, action: if U, to y=4 at τ=2, but y=4 occupied τ=2, collision.\n\nSo cannot U. Must S or D.\n\nIf S, at τ=2 y=3.\n\nIf D, at τ=2 y=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, from y=3, if S, y=3 at τ=3? Let's see positions.\n\nTime line:\n\nTurn τ: position y_τ\n\nAction a_τ taken at turn τ, sets y_{τ+1}\n\nAt turn τ, collision based on y_τ.\n\nStart τ=0: y=3\n\nAction a0: S or D (not U)\n\nCase 1: a0 = S\n\nThen at τ=1, y=3 (since S, Δy=0)\n\nAt τ=1, y=3 safe.\n\nAction a1: if U, then y_{τ=2} =4, but at τ=2, y=4 occupied, collision. So cannot U.\n\nIf S, then y_{τ=2} =3\n\nIf D, y_{τ=2}=2\n\nIf S at a1, then at τ=2, y=3 safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, action a2: if U, to y=4 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=4: τ=3 not occupied (since occupied τ=1,2,9,10,11, τ=3 is 46, not in list), so safe.\n\nThen we can go up.\n\nIf at a1 we did D, to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=2 safe.\n\nThen a2: U to y=3 at τ=3, or S to y=2, or D to y=1.\n\nThen at τ=3, if y=3, we can U to y=4 at τ=4, etc.\n\nBut it takes more turns.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go as fast as possible.\n\nSo from above, if we stay at τ=0 and τ=1, we can go up at τ=2 to y=4 at τ=3.\n\nBut we lost two turns not moving up.\n\nAt τ=0, if we go down to y=2.\n\na0 = D\n\nThen at τ=1, y=2 safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, we can take U to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=3 safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, take U to y=4 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=4 safe, same as above.\n\nSo in both cases, we reach y=4 at τ=3.\n\nFrom y=3 at τ=0, by staying or down at τ=0, and then appropriate actions, we can be at y=4 at τ=3.\n\nNow from there, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=4 at τ=3.\n\nWe can go up to y=5 at τ=4.\n\nIs y=5 safe at τ=4? y=5 occupied only at τ=1, so τ=4 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6,7,8 all safe except τ=1.\n\nNow, but y=4 has other occupied times, but we are moving up.\n\nAt τ=4, y=5.\n\nThen τ=5, y=6; τ=6, y=7; τ=7, y=8; τ=8, y=9.\n\ny=9 is target, safe.\n\nNow, check if all positions safe.\n\nPath: start τ=0, y=3\n\nWe need to choose actions to reach y=4 at τ=3.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, take S, so y remains 3 at τ=1? Action at τ=0 sets y_{τ=1}.\n\nτ=0: take S, so y_{1} = y_0 + 0 = 3\n\nAt τ=1: take S again, so y_{2} = y_1 + 0 = 3\n\nAt τ=2: take U, so y_{3} = y_2 +1 = 4\n\nThen at τ=3: y=4, safe.\n\nThen τ=3: take U, y_{4} =5\n\nτ=4: y=5, safe.\n\nτ=4: take U, y_{5} =6\n\nτ=5: y=6, safe.\n\nτ=5: take U, y_{6} =7\n\nτ=6: y=7, safe.\n\nτ=6: take U, y_{7} =8\n\nτ=7: y=8, safe? y=8 occupied only at τ=1, which is past, so safe.\n\nτ=7: take U, y_{8} =9\n\nτ=8: y=9, reached.\n\nH is the number of actions to reach at turn t₁ + H.\n\nAt turn t₁ + H, position y=9.\n\nHere, from τ=0 to τ=8, we have actions from τ=0 to τ=7, 8 actions? Let's see.\n\nActions: from t=0 to t=H-1 for H actions.\n\nAt time after H actions, at turn t₁ + H.\n\nHere, at τ=0 (t₁), we take action a0.\n\nAfter a0, at τ=1, y1.\n\n...\n\nAfter a7 at τ=7, at τ=8, y8=9.\n\nSo actions from τ=0 to τ=7, 8 actions, reach at τ=8.\n\nH=8.\n\nBut we started at y=3, to y=9, difference 6, so minimum 6, but we used 8 actions because we stayed twice.\n\nIn this sequence, we stayed at τ=0 and τ=1, both S.\n\nThen from τ=2 to τ=7, all U.\n\nActions: τ=0: S, τ=1: S, τ=2: U, τ=3: U, τ=4: U, τ=5: U, τ=6: U, τ=7: U\n\nPositions: τ=0: y=3, τ=1: y=3, τ=2: y=3 (after S at τ=1), no:\n\nAt τ=0: position y=3, take S, so y_{1} =3\n\nAt τ=1: position y=3, take S, so y_{2} =3\n\nAt τ=2: position y=3, take U, so y_{3} =4\n\nAt τ=3: position y=4, take U, y_{4} =5\n\n...\nUp to τ=7: position y=8, take U, y_{8} =9\n\nAt τ=8: position y=9.\n\nNow, collision check:\n\nAt τ=0: y=3, not occupied (occupied only τ=13-16), safe.\n\nτ=1: y=3, same, safe.\n\nτ=2: y=3, safe.\n\nτ=3: y=4, τ=3 not occupied for y=4 (occupied τ=1,2,9,10,11), so safe.\n\nτ=4: y=5, not occupied (only τ=1), safe.\n\nτ=5: y=6, safe.\n\nτ=6: y=7, safe.\n\nτ=7: y=8, safe (only occupied τ=1).\n\nτ=8: y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nSo this works in H=8 actions, reaching at turn t₁+8.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nWe used two S at the beginning, but perhaps we can avoid that.\n\nEarlier I thought about going down first.\n\nAt τ=0, take D, to y=2 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, take U to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, take U to y=4 at τ=3.\n\nThen same as before, y=4 at τ=3.\n\nThen go up.\n\nSo actions: τ=0: D, τ=1: U, τ=2: U, then U to y=9.\n\nFrom τ=2: U to y=4 at τ=3.\n\nThen τ=3: U to y=5 at τ=4\n\n...\n\nUp to τ=7: U to y=9 at τ=8.\n\nSame number of actions: actions from τ=0 to τ=7, 8 actions.\n\nPositions: τ=0: y=3, take D, y1=2\n\nτ=1: y=2, take U, y2=3\n\nτ=2: y=3, take U, y3=4\n\nτ=3: y=4, take U, y4=5\n\n...\n\nτ=7: y=8, take U, y8=9\n\nτ=8: y=9\n\nSame H=8.\n\nBut in this case, at τ=1 we are at y=2, which is fine.\n\nBut H is same.\n\nNow, can we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, can we be at y=4 earlier than τ=3?\n\nBut at τ=1 and τ=2, y=4 is occupied, so we cannot be on y=4 at those times.\n\nSo the earliest we can be on y=4 is τ=3.\n\nThen from there, we go up one per turn, to y=9 at τ=8, as above.\n\nBut y=4 to y=9 is 5 steps, from τ=3 to τ=8, that's 5 actions to increase by 5? y=4 to y=9 is +5, so 5 up actions.\n\nIn the sequence, from τ=3 to τ=8, we have positions: at τ=3 y=4, then after actions up to τ=7, y=8 to y=9 at τ=8.\n\nNumber of actions from τ=3 to τ=7 for the ups, but we start from y=4 at τ=3.\n\nTo reach y=9 at τ=8, we need to increase by 5 in 5 steps, so 5 U actions from τ=3 to τ=7.\n\nBut we need to get to y=4 at τ=3 first.\n\nFrom start, at τ=0 y=3, to y=4 at τ=3, which takes 3 turns: we can have y=3 at τ=0, and after three actions, at τ=3 y=4.\n\nIn those three actions, we need net +1, but since we cannot go directly, we have to have some S or D.\n\nFor example, in the first sequence, we had two S and one U: actions τ=0 S, τ=1 S, τ=2 U, so at τ=3 y=4.\n\nNet: two stays, one up, from y=3 to y=4 in three turns.\n\nSimilarly, in the down version: τ=0 D, τ=1 U, τ=2 U, from y=3 to y=2 to y=3 to y=4, net one down and two up, but down and up cancel, plus one up, so net +1 in three turns.\n\nSo we cannot do better than reaching y=4 at τ=3.\n\nThen to y=9 at τ=8.\n\nH=8 actions, to turn t₁+8.\n\nBut is there a way to reach y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=4 at τ=3, and then go up, but we have to go through each y.\n\ny=4 to y=5 to y=6 etc., each step takes one turn.\n\nUnless we can skip, but no, we move one step per action.\n\nSo from y=4 to y=9, 5 steps, 5 actions, so position at τ=3 +5 = τ=8.\n\nMinimum.\n\nBut we have to consider if we can go faster through other rows, but we have to go through y=4 to y=8.\n\ny=5 to y=8 are safe except at τ=1, which is not an issue since we are later.\n\nBut y=4 has the constraint.\n\nAnother thing: at later times, y=4 is occupied again at τ=9,10,11, but since we are going up quickly, τ=3 to τ=8, before τ=9, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly, other rows fine.\n\nBut in the above, we have H=8.\n\nBut let's confirm the occupied times again.\n\ny=4 occupied at τ=1,2,9,10,11.\n\nWe are at y=4 at τ=3, which is fine.\n\nThen we leave y=4 at τ=3 to y=5, so not on y=4 after.\n\nThen y=5 at τ=4, fine.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut can we start going up earlier?\n\nSuppose at τ=0, we stay, y=3 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, instead of staying or down, we cannot go up, but we can stay.\n\nThen at τ=2, we go to y=4, but τ=2 occupied, cannot.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps go to another row, but we have to go through y=4.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps we can go to y=3 or y=2 and wait, but that would take more turns, not better.\n\nOr go down to y=0, but y=0 is safe, but going down and up takes more turns.\n\nFor example, if at τ=0 go down to y=2, then at τ=1 go down to y=1, then at τ=2 go up to y=2, etc., but that would take longer to reach y=9.\n\nSo worse.\n\nThus minimal H should be 8.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach y=9 at τ=7 or something.\n\nFor example, if we could be at y=4 at τ=3, then if we could go faster, but we can only increase by one per turn, so from y=4, to y=9, takes 5 turns, at τ=8.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we start at y=3.\n\nAt τ=0, if we go up, we get collision, not possible.\n\nSo I think H=8 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to specify the actions.\n\nIn the first sequence: actions at t₁ to t₁+7.\n\nt₁=43.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn t₁: S\n\nTurn t₁+1: S\n\nTurn t₁+2: U\n\nTurn t₁+3: U\n\nTurn t₁+4: U\n\nTurn t₁+5: U\n\nTurn t₁+6: U\n\nTurn t₁+7: U\n\nThen at turn t₁+8, y=9.\n\nIn terms of the answer, we need to list actions from t=0 to H-1, so for H=8, actions at t₁ to t₁+7.\n\nNow, but in the sequence above, at turn t₁+2, we go U to y=4 at t₁+3.\n\nt₁+2 is turn 45, which is τ=2, action U, to y=4 at τ=3, turn t₁+3=46.\n\nPosition at turn t₁+3 is y=4.\n\nNow, is there a problem with other occupied times?\n\nFor example, when we are at y=5,6,7,8, all fine.\n\nBut y=4 at τ=3 is fine.\n\nLater, at τ=9,10,11, y=4 occupied, but we are at higher y by then.\n\nIn the path, at τ=3 we are at y=4, then go up, so at τ=4 y=5, etc., up to τ=8 y=9.\n\nτ=9 is later, not reached.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut we have to make sure that during the moves, no collision.\n\nFor example, when we move from y=4 to y=5 at turn τ=3: at turn τ=3, we are on y=4, take U, so at next turn τ=4, we are on y=5.\n\nAt turn τ=3, we are on y=4, which is safe, as we said.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nIn the down version: actions τ=0: D, τ=1: U, τ=2: U, then same U to end.\n\nBut with D first, we go to y=2 at τ=1, which is fine, but H same.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly after waiting.\n\nBut I think 8 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see the car on freeway 4 at τ=0, but we not on it.\n\nAnother thing: at τ=1, y=5,6,7,8 are occupied, but we not on them.\n\nIn the sequence, we are on y=3 or 2 at τ=1, not affected.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 faster by going through when y=4 is safe, but we have to wait until τ=3.\n\nBut what about the other occupied times for y=4? τ=9,10,11, later, but we can be on y=4 earlier? But τ=0,1,2 not possible.\n\nτ=3 is earliest.\n\nThen from there, to y=9 min 5 turns, total 8 turns from start.\n\nSince we start at τ=0 y=3, and after 8 actions at τ=8 y=9.\n\nH=8.\n\nBut let's confirm the number.\n\nInitial position at turn t₁=43, y=3.\n\nAfter first action at t₁, position at t₁+1.\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, position at t₁+H.\n\nWe want y_{t₁+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, with actions as above, at t₁+8, y=9.\n\nWith 8 actions.\n\nSince we need to increase by 6, but we have delays, min H=8.\n\nBut is there a way with H=7?\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at t₁+7.\n\nThat means after 7 actions, at τ=7, y=9.\n\nSince start y=3, need net +6 in 7 actions, so we can have some stays or downs, but that would require more ups, but +6 in 7 actions means the sum of Δy must be +6.\n\nEach U is +1, D is -1, S is 0.\n\nSo to have net +6, number of U minus number of D must be 6.\n\nAnd number of actions H=7.\n\nSo let U be number of up, D down, S stay, U + D + S =7, U - D =6.\n\nThen from U - D =6, U + D + S=7, add: 2U + S =13, subtract: 2D + S =1.\n\nSince S >=0, 2D + S=1, so possible D=0, S=1; or D=1, S=-1 impossible, so only D=0, S=1.\n\nThen U=6.\n\nSo actions: 6 U and 1 S.\n\nNow, we need to have a sequence where we avoid collisions.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=3.\n\nAfter actions, at τ=7, y=9.\n\nWith one stay and six ups.\n\nThe stay must be at some point where we cannot go up.\n\nFor example, if we stay at τ=0, then y=3 at τ=1.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9 at τ=7.\n\nFrom τ=1 to τ=7, we have 6 actions to go from y=3 to y=9, net +6, so all U possible, but we have one S already at τ=0.\n\nActions: suppose at τ=0: S, so y1=3\n\nThen from τ=1 to τ=6, take 6 U actions.\n\nThen y at τ=1:3, τ=2:4 (after U at τ=1), τ=3:5, τ=4:6, τ=5:7, τ=6:8, τ=7:9.\n\nNow, positions: τ=0: y=3, safe\n\nτ=1: y=3, safe\n\nτ=2: y=4, but at τ=2, y=4 occupied, collision! Not good.\n\nIf we stay at another time.\n\nSuppose at τ=0, we take U, but cannot, because to y=4 at τ=1, occupied.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt τ=1, we take S.\n\nBut at τ=1, we need to be at some position.\n\nStart: at τ=0, y=3.\n\nSuppose take U at τ=0: but then at τ=1, y=4, occupied, collision, invalid.\n\nCannot take U at τ=0.\n\nMust take S or D at τ=0.\n\nIf take S at τ=0: y1=3 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, we can take S or U or D.\n\nIf take U at τ=1: then y2=4 at τ=2, but τ=2 y=4 occupied, collision.\n\nIf take S at τ=1: y2=3 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, take U: y3=4 at τ=3.\n\nThen from τ=3, take U to y4=5 at τ=4, ..., up to τ=6 take U to y7=8 at τ=7? Let's see.\n\nAfter S at τ=0 and S at τ=1, we have two stays already, but we want only one stay for H=7.\n\nIn H=7, we need only one S.\n\nBut here, if we take S at τ=0, and then at τ=1 we take U, but collision.\n\nIf at τ=1 we take S, then y2=3 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, take U to y3=4 at τ=3.\n\nThen we need to go from y=4 at τ=3 to y=9 at τ=7.\n\nThat requires +5 in 4 actions, so all U, but 4 U to y=8 at τ=7? y at τ=3:4\n\nTake U at τ=3: y4=5\n\nU at τ=4: y5=6\n\nU at τ=5: y6=7\n\nU at τ=6: y7=8\n\nThen at τ=7, y=8, not 9. We need to reach y=9 at τ=7.\n\nAfter 7 actions, position at τ=7.\n\nWith actions from τ=0 to τ=6.\n\nIn this case, from above: actions τ=0: S, τ=1: S, τ=2: U, τ=3: U, τ=4: U, τ=5: U, τ=6: U\n\nThen positions: τ=0:3, τ=1:3 (after S at τ=0), τ=2:3 (after S at τ=1? Action at τ=1: S, so y at τ=2 is 3)\n\nThen action at τ=2: U, so y at τ=3 is 4\n\nτ=3: U, y4=5\n\n...\n\nτ=6: U, y7=8\n\nSo at τ=7, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need one more U.\n\nBut with H=7 actions, we can only reach y=8 if we start from y=3 with 5 net up, but we need +6.\n\nIn the sequence with two S, we reach y=8 at τ=7 with 7 actions, but y=8 not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need the 8th action.\n\nWith one S and six U, but we cannot avoid the collision at τ=2 if we go up early.\n\nSuppose we take the stay later.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, take D to y=2 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, take U to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, take U to y=4 at τ=3, but τ=2 action U, to y=4 at τ=3.\n\nThen from τ=3 y=4, take U to y=5 at τ=4, ..., up to take U at τ=6 to y=8 at τ=7? y at τ=3:4, U at τ=3: y4=5, U at τ=4: y5=6, U at τ=5: y6=7, U at τ=6: y7=8, so at τ=7 y=8.\n\nNot 9.\n\nTo have y=9 at τ=7, we need y at τ=7 to be 9.\n\nFrom y=3 at τ=0, after 7 actions, net +6.\n\nBut to be on y=4 at some point, we need to be at τ=3 or later, but with net +6 in 7 actions, we can have, for example, go down and up, but that might not help.\n\nSuppose at τ=0 take S, y1=3\n\nThen at τ=1 take U, but to y=4 at τ=2, collision, not possible.\n\nTake D at τ=0, y1=2\n\nThen at τ=1 take U, y2=3\n\nThen at τ=2 take U, y3=4 at τ=3\n\nThen same as before.\n\nAt τ=1, if we take U, but from y=2, to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nNo way to be on y=4 before τ=3.\n\nAnd from y=4 at τ=3, to y=9 at τ=7, that would require 4 actions: to y=5,6,7,8 at τ=7, not 9.\n\ny at τ=3:4, after action at τ=3, y at τ=4, etc.\n\nAfter k actions, at τ=k.\n\nSo from τ=3 to τ=7, 4 actions, can reach y=4 to y=8.\n\nTo reach y=9, need 5 actions from y=4.\n\nThus from start, to y=4 at τ=3 min, then to y=9 at τ=8 min.\n\nThus H=8 is minimal.\n\nSo we should use the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, we have to output the actions.\n\nIn the first one, with two S at beginning.\n\nBut in the answer, we need minimal H, and the sequence.\n\nWith down, same H.\n\nBut perhaps we can have the stay at different point, but H same.\n\nNow, in the sequence, when we go up, all rows above are safe except at τ=1, which is not issue.\n\nBut y=4 at τ=3 is fine.\n\nNow, but we need to make sure about the later occupied times for y=4, but not relevant.\n\nAnother thing: at τ=9,10,11, y=4 occupied, but we are not there.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 4, there is a car at (0,-11,right,4) at t1, which at τ=0, span includes 0, but since player not on y=4 at τ=0, ok.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, for the sequence, let's write the actions.\n\nUsing the first sequence without down.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t1: S\n\nTurn t1+1: S\n\nTurn t1+2: U\n\nTurn t1+3: U\n\nTurn t1+4: U\n\nTurn t1+5: U\n\nTurn t1+6: U\n\nTurn t1+7: U\n\nt1=43.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 43: S\n\nTurn 44: S\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nThen at turn 51, y=9? Let's see.\n\nAfter actions:\n\nTurn 43: action S, position at 44: y=3\n\nTurn 44: action S, position at 45: y=3\n\nTurn 45: action U, position at 46: y=4\n\nTurn 46: action U, position at 47: y=5\n\nTurn 47: action U, position at 48: y=6\n\nTurn 48: action U, position at 49: y=7\n\nTurn 49: action U, position at 50: y=8\n\nTurn 50: action U, position at 51: y=9\n\nSo reached at turn 51, which is t1+8=43+8=51.\n\nH=8.\n\nIn the action list, we have from turn 43 to 50, 8 actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 45, position at 46 is y=4, which is turn 46, τ=3, T=46, which is not occupied, as we said.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nWith down: turn 43: D, position at 44: y=2\n\nTurn 44: U, position at 45: y=3\n\nTurn 45: U, position at 46: y=4\n\nThen same as before, turn 46: U, to y=5 at 47, etc., up to turn 50: U to y=9 at 51.\n\nSame.\n\nBut in this case, at turn 44, position at 45 is y=3, but turn 44 is τ=1, position y=2? At turn 44, position is y=2 (after D at 43), then action U at 44, to y=3 at 45.\n\nAt turn 44, position y=2, which is safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut H same.\n\nSo either way.\n\nI think we can use the first one with S.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case H=8.\n\nBut let's see if we can do with H=7 by a different path.\n\nSuppose we go to y=5 directly or something, but no, we move one step.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=4 at τ=3, but if we could start going up later, but no.\n\nAnother idea: what if we go to y=0 or something, but that takes more turns.\n\nFor example, go down to y=0 at τ=1, then go up, but to y=9, it takes more actions.\n\nFor instance, from y=3 at τ=0, D to y=2 at τ=1, D to y=1 at τ=2, then U to y=2 at τ=3, etc., but to reach y=9, it would take more than 8 actions.\n\nSo worse.\n\nThus H=8 is minimal.\n\nSo we'll go with that.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we need to output the actions.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5 to 8, occupied at τ=1 only, which we avoid.\n\nAlso, for y=3, occupied at τ=13-16, but we leave early.\n\nIn our sequence, we are at y=3 until τ=2, but τ=2 is T=45, τ=2=45-43=2, and occupied for y=3 starts τ=13, which is later, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut in the format.\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn 43: S\n\nTurn 44: S\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\n}\n\nBut let's write in terms of t.\n\nCurrent turn t1=43.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t1: S\n\nTurn t1+1: S\n\nTurn t1+2: U\n\nTurn t1+3: U\n\nTurn t1+4: U\n\nTurn t1+5: U\n\nTurn t1+6: U\n\nTurn t1+7: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nSince it says \\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so t from 0 to 7.\n\na_{t1+0} = S\n\na_{t1+1} = S\n\na_{t1+2} = U\n\n...\n\na_{t1+7} = U\n\nIn the answer, list as:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}  which is S\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1} S\n\netc.\n\nSo I think we have it.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check if we can have a sequence with H=7.\n\nSuppose we reach y=4 at τ=3 with one less action, but we need three actions to go from y=3 at τ=0 to y=4 at τ=3, which requires at least three actions: for example, S,S,U or D,U,U, etc., all three actions.\n\nThen from y=4 at τ=3 to y=9 at τ=7, need four actions, to y=8 at τ=7.\n\nCannot reach y=9.\n\nIf we reach a higher y earlier, but we cannot because we have to go through y=4.\n\nUnless we skip, but movement is one step.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nThus minimal H is 8.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 43\\) is 8. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) based on the car positions and update rules.\n\n### Explanation:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 3\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 43\\).\n- To avoid collisions, the player must not be on freeway \\(y = 4\\) at turns where it is occupied (turns 44, 45, 52, 53, 54 relative to \\(t_1 = 43\\), i.e., absolute turns 44, 45, 52, 53, 54).\n- Similarly, freeways \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are occupied only at turn 44 (absolute turn 44), and freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 3\\) are occupied at turns 56 to 59 (absolute turns 56 to 59), but these are avoided by moving up quickly.\n- The earliest safe turn to be on \\(y = 4\\) is turn 46 (absolute turn), as it is unoccupied at that time.\n- From \\(y = 3\\) at turn 43, staying (S) for two turns (turns 43 and 44) keeps the player at \\(y = 3\\), which is safe, and avoids being on \\(y = 4\\) at the occupied turns 44 and 45.\n- Then, moving up (U) repeatedly from turn 45 to turn 50 reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 51 (absolute turn) without collisions:\n  - At turn 46, \\(y = 4\\) is safe (not occupied).\n  - From turn 47 to 50, \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are safe as they are only occupied at turn 44, which has passed.\n  - \\(y = 9\\) has no cars and is safe.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{43 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{7}\\) is:\n\n- Turn 43: S (stay at \\(y = 3\\))\n- Turn 44: S (stay at \\(y = 3\\))\n- Turn 45: U (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 46)\n- Turn 46: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 47)\n- Turn 47: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 48)\n- Turn 48: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 49)\n- Turn 49: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 50)\n- Turn 50: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 51)\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 51 (\\(t_1 + 8\\)) with no collisions, and \\(H = 8\\) is minimal because:\n- Being on \\(y = 4\\) before turn 46 causes a collision (occupied at turns 44 and 45).\n- From \\(y = 4\\) at turn 46, reaching \\(y = 9\\) requires 5 up moves (turns 46 to 50), taking 5 turns to reach turn 51.\n- Starting from \\(y = 3\\) at turn 43, reaching \\(y = 4\\) safely by turn 46 requires 3 turns (with 2 stays and 1 up), making the total \\(H = 8\\) minimal.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 43: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 44: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 45: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 46: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 47: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 48: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 50: & U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 45, and the player is at (0,3). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position y is in [0,9]. We start at y=3 and want to get to y=9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T and at that turn, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player). Note that the player is only on one freeway per turn, and when moving, at turn T the player is on freeway y_T, and the move action at turn T will update the position to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nImportant: When the player moves at turn T from y_T to y_{T+1}, then at turn T the player is on freeway y_T. At turn T+1, the player is on freeway y_{T+1}. So, we only check the car on the current freeway at the current turn.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=45. We need to compute the car positions at future turns.\n\nThe car update:\n- For a car at turn t1: head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s.\n- For a future turn T (>= t1), the time passed is T - t1.\n- If the car is left-moving (but note: the given directions are \"right\" and we assume \"left\" if not specified? Actually, the example only has \"right\". Let me check the update rules:\n\nThe update rule for left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the initial span for right-moving is given as (head, tail) and in the example: for freeway 4: (-28, -39, right, 4) -> but this seems odd because for a right-moving car, the head is the front, so if it's moving right, then the head should be at a larger x than the tail. However, here the head is -28 and tail is -39, which is actually increasing? Because -28 > -39. So that's consistent: the car spans from x=-39 to x=-28, and as it moves right, the span becomes [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt].\n\nBut note: the initial representation for right-moving is (head, tail) and head is the larger value? Actually, in the update rule for right-moving, they write the initial span as [tau, h] meaning the tail is the left end and head is the right end? But in the input, they write (head, tail) and then direction and speed.\n\nLooking at the input for freeway 4: \n  (-28, -39, right, 4): so head = -28, tail = -39. Since it's right-moving, the head (front) is at -28 and tail (back) is at -39. Then the initial span is from tail to head: [-39, -28]. Then at time T, the span becomes: [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)] = [-39 + 4*(T-45), -28 + 4*(T-45)].\n\nSimilarly, the other car on freeway 4: (8, -3, right, 4): head=8, tail=-3 -> so the car spans from -3 to 8? Actually, that doesn't make sense because -3 < 8, so that's a car from -3 to 8? But then the next one: (44,33,right,4): 33 to 44.\n\nWait, in the input, the first number is head, the second is tail. For a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost point? Then the tail is the leftmost? So the car spans from tail to head.\n\nBut in the update rule for right-moving: they write: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] -> so the tail is the left end and head the right end.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] -> so the head is the right end (since we subtract and the car moves left) and tail the left end? But wait, if the car moves left, then the entire car shifts left. The head is the front, so for left-moving the head is the leftmost? Actually, the problem doesn't specify which is which. But the update rule is given.\n\nSo, let's interpret the input: for a car (head, tail, direction, speed):\n- If direction is right: the car initially (at t1=45) spans [tail, head] (because tail is the left end, head is the right end). Then at time T, the car spans [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)].\n- If direction is left: the car initially spans [head, tail]? Actually, the update rule for left: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] -> so the head is the right end (because when moving left, the head becomes h - s*dt, which is less than the tail? tau - s*dt?).\n\nBut in our input, all cars are right-moving. So we don't have to worry about left.\n\nNow, collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at time T.\n\nNote: the freeway index is the y-coordinate. So for each freeway (y=1 to 8), we have a set of cars.\n\nWe are at turn 45 at y=3. We want to go to y=9.\n\nWe can plan a path: we can move up, down, or stay. We must avoid being on a freeway that has a car whose span includes 0 at the exact turn we are on that freeway.\n\nSince we are starting at y=3, and we want to get to y=9, we need to go up 6 steps. The minimal number of turns is at least 6 (if we go up every turn). But we might have to wait (stay) or even go down to avoid collisions.\n\nWe are to compute the car positions at future turns. Let dt = T - 45.\n\nWe need to simulate the car positions for freeways 1 to 8 for turns T>=45.\n\nLet me list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-33, -44, right, 3)\n  At T, the car spans: [ -44 + 3*(T-45), -33 + 3*(T-45) ]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-33,-44,right,3) -> same car? But same freeway? Actually, no: each freeway has its own set of cars. So freeway2 has the same car configuration.\n\nFreeway 3: same.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars:\n  car1: (-28, -39, right, 4) -> [ -39 + 4*(T-45), -28 + 4*(T-45) ]\n  car2: (8, -3, right, 4) -> [ -3 + 4*(T-45), 8 + 4*(T-45) ]\n  car3: (44, 33, right, 4) -> [33 + 4*(T-45), 44 + 4*(T-45)]\n\nFreeway 5: two cars:\n  car1: (12,1,right,12) -> [1+12*(T-45), 12+12*(T-45)]\n  car2: (60,49,right,12) -> [49+12*(T-45), 60+12*(T-45)]\n\nFreeways 6,7,8: same as freeway5.\n\nWe are at turn 45, and we are on freeway 3 (because y=3) at turn 45. But note: at turn 45, we are at (0,3). We must check if at turn 45, freeway3 has a car that includes 0.\n\nFor freeway3 at T=45: \n  car: [ -44 + 3*(0) = -44, -33] -> so 0 is not in [-44,-33]. So safe.\n\nNow, we plan the next moves.\n\nWe want to minimize H, the number of turns. The minimal H is 6 (if we go up 6 times). But we must avoid collisions at every step.\n\nLet me check the next few turns for freeways 4 to 8 (since we are going up) and also note that we might have to avoid freeway 3 if we stay, but we are leaving freeway3.\n\nWe start at y=3 at turn45. We choose an action for turn45.\n\nWe can choose U, D, or S.\n\nIf we go up at turn45, then at turn46 we will be at y=4.\n\nBut at turn45, we are on freeway3. We are safe because no car at freeway3 covers 0.\n\nThen at turn46, we will be on freeway4 (if we moved up). So we must check freeway4 at turn46.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to y=2, then at turn46 we are on freeway2.\n\nBut our goal is to go up, so going down is counterproductive. We might consider going down only to avoid a collision and then go up, but that would take more turns. We want minimal turns, so we prefer going up if possible.\n\nSo let's try going up for 6 consecutive turns and see if we can avoid collisions.\n\nWe need to check for each turn T (from 45 to 50) and the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nAt turn45: y=3 -> freeway3: safe (as above).\n\nAt turn46: we plan to be at y=4 -> freeway4.\n\nCheck freeway4 at T=46 (dt=1):\n  car1: [-39+4*1, -28+4*1] = [-35, -24] -> 0 not in this interval.\n  car2: [-3+4*1, 8+4*1] = [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12]? 0 is less than 1 -> no.\n  car3: [33+4, 44+4] = [37,48] -> no.\n\nSo freeway4 at T=46 is safe.\n\nAt turn47: y=5 -> freeway5.\n\nCheck freeway5 at T=47 (dt=2):\n  car1: [1+12*2, 12+12*2] = [1+24, 12+24] = [25,36] -> 0 not in.\n  car2: [49+24, 60+24] = [73,84] -> no.\n\nSafe.\n\nAt turn48: y=6 -> freeway6.\n\nFreeway6 has the same cars as freeway5: [25,36] and [73,84] -> safe.\n\nAt turn49: y=7 -> freeway7: same as above -> safe.\n\nAt turn50: y=8 -> freeway8: same -> safe.\n\nThen at turn51: we would be at y=9? Wait, we started at turn45 at y=3, then:\n\nturn45: y=3\nturn46: y=4 (after first U)\nturn47: y=5 (second U)\nturn48: y=6 (third U)\nturn49: y=7 (fourth U)\nturn50: y=8 (fifth U)\nturn51: y=9 (sixth U)\n\nSo we need 6 moves of U, and we reach y=9 at turn51.\n\nBut we must check every step: we are on freeway3 at turn45, freeway4 at turn46, freeway5 at turn47, freeway6 at turn48, freeway7 at turn49, freeway8 at turn50, and then at turn51 we are at y=9 and the game ends? Note: we are required to reach (0,9). The problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1. So at the last action (the H-th action) we should be at (0,9). \n\nIn our plan, at turn45 we start at y=3. Then we take actions at turns 45,46,47,48,49,50 (6 actions). After the last action (at turn50), we are at y=9 at turn51? Actually, the position at the end of the last action is the state at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: we take actions from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, and at the end of these actions, at turn t1+H, we are at (0,9). So we want the state at turn t1+H to be (0,9). \n\nHow does the update work?\n- At turn t, we are at position (0, y_t). We choose action a_t. Then we update: y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, where delta is based on a_t.\n\nSo after the action at turn t, the next state is at turn t+1.\n\nWe start at turn t1=45: state (0,3).\nWe take action a_45 at turn45, then state at turn46: (0, y46) = (0, 3 + delta45)\n...\nWe take action a_{45+H-1} at turn (45+H-1), then the state at turn (45+H) is (0,9).\n\nWe need H such that after H actions, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn our plan: \n  turn45: action U -> state46: y=4\n  turn46: U -> state47: y=5\n  turn47: U -> state48: y=6\n  turn48: U -> state49: y=7\n  turn49: U -> state50: y=8\n  turn50: U -> state51: y=9\n\nSo we take 6 actions (H=6) at turns 45 to 50, and at turn51 we are at y=9.\n\nNow, we must check that at every turn (45 to 50) we are safe.\n\nWe already checked:\n  turn45 (y=3): safe.\n  turn46 (y=4): safe.\n\nBut note: at turn47 we are at freeway5? Actually, at turn47 we are at y=5? But we are at turn47: we are at freeway5 at turn47? \n\nWait, the state at turn47 is y=5. That means at turn47 we are on freeway5. So we must check freeway5 at turn47.\n\nSimilarly, at turn48 we are on freeway6 at turn48, etc.\n\nWe checked freeway5 at turn47 (dt=2): safe.\n\nBut what about the other freeways? We are only on one freeway per turn.\n\nSo we only need to check the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nTurn45: U -> goes to y=4 at turn46. But at turn45 we are at y=3: safe. Then at turn46 we are at y=4: we checked freeway4 at turn46: safe.\n\nThen turn46: U -> goes to y=5 at turn47. At turn46 we are at y=4: we don't need to check again? Actually, we already did for turn46. Then at turn47 we are at y=5: we check freeway5 at turn47: we did and it was safe.\n\nSimilarly, we checked freeway6 at turn48: same as freeway5 at turn47? But note: freeway5 and freeway6 have the same cars? Actually, freeway5,6,7,8 all have the same cars: two cars each.\n\nBut at turn48, for freeway6 at T=48 (dt=3):\n\n  car1: [1+12*3, 12+12*3] = [1+36,12+36] = [37,48] -> 0 not in.\n  car2: [49+36,60+36] = [85,96] -> not in.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 at turn49 (dt=4):\n  car1: [1+48,12+48]=[49,60] -> no\n  car2: [49+48,60+48]=[97,108] -> no\n\nFreeway8 at turn50 (dt=5):\n  car1: [1+60,12+60]=[61,72] -> no\n  car2: [49+60,60+60]=[109,120] -> no\n\nSo all safe.\n\nBut wait, we must also check that we are safe at the starting turn? We did.\n\nBut note: we are at y=3 at turn45: safe. Then we move to y=4 at turn46: and at turn46 we are at y=4: we checked and safe. Then we move to y=5 at turn47: safe. Then to y=6 at turn48: safe. Then to y=7 at turn49: safe. Then to y=8 at turn50: safe. And then we end at y=9 at turn51.\n\nSo we have a 6-move plan: all U.\n\nBut the problem says: we must avoid collisions at every turn we are on a freeway. Note that when we are at y=9, that is the goal and we are not on any freeway (since freeways are from y=1 to 8). So no collision check at y=9.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\n\nBut wait, we are at turn45: we are at y=3. Then we do U at turn45 -> next state y=4 at turn46.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to output the actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1. So H=6, so we output for turns 45,46,47,48,49,50.\n\nHowever, let me double-check the freeway4 at turn46: we have a car2: [1,12] at turn46. The player is at (0,4) at turn46. But the car on freeway4 at turn46: car2 spans [1,12]? Then 0 is not in [1,12]? Correct.\n\nBut wait, there's another car on freeway4: car1: [-35,-24] and car3: [37,48]. So no car covers 0.\n\nBut what about freeway5 at turn47? We have car1: [25,36] and car2: [73,84] -> 0 not in.\n\nBut note: freeway5 at turn47: the cars are moving fast. But at turn47, the car1 is at [25,36] and car2 at [73,84]. So no problem.\n\nHowever, I notice that on freeway4 at turn46, there is a car that spans [1,12] at turn46. But at turn45, that same car was at [-3,8]? At turn45: car2 on freeway4: [-3,8]. Then at turn46: [-3+4,8+4] = [1,12]. So the car moves from x=-3 to x=1? Then at turn45, if we had been on freeway4, we would have been at (0,4) at turn45? But we weren't. At turn45 we were at y=3.\n\nBut what if we had stayed at freeway4 for more than one turn? We don't.\n\nSo the plan seems safe.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". That means at turn T, we are only on y_T. So in our plan, at each turn we are only on the freeway we started that turn on, and then we move to the next. So we only need to check the freeway we are on at the current turn.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in less? We start at y=3 and need to get to y=9: we must go up 6 steps. So 6 is minimal.\n\nBut what if we can skip freeways? We are going through every freeway from 3 to 8, and we checked they are safe.\n\nBut wait, what about freeway1,2,3? We are at freeway3 at turn45 and then we leave. But we don't go back.\n\nSo the answer should be 6 consecutive U.\n\nBut let me check the initial state again: at turn45, we are at y=3. The car on freeway3: [-44, -33] at turn45: safe.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". We are not required to avoid collisions on y=0 or y=9? And we are at y=3 at turn45: safe.\n\nBut wait, what about freeway4 at turn45? We don't care because we are not on it. Only the freeway we are currently on matters.\n\nSo I think we are good.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway4 at turn45: \n  car2: [-3,8] at turn45. So 0 is in [-3,8]? Because -3 <= 0 <=8. So if we were on freeway4 at turn45, we would collide. But we are not.\n\nSimilarly, at turn46: that car moves to [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\nSo if we had been on freeway4 at turn45, we would have collided. But we are at y=3 at turn45.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\n\nBut the output should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So t from 0 to H-1: so for t=0: a_{t1+0}=a45, t=1: a46, ... t=5: a50.\n\nYes.\n\nBut note: the initial turn is t1=45, and we do actions at turns 45,46,...,50 (6 actions) and then at turn51 we are at (0,9).\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway4 at turn46: the car2: at turn45 it was at [-3,8] -> then at turn46: [-3+4=1, 8+4=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not included. Correct.\n\nBut what about freeway5 at turn47: car1: at turn45: [1,12] -> then at turn47 (dt=2): [1+24=25, 12+24=36] -> 0 not included.\n\nBut wait, at turn46, if we were to stay at freeway4? But we don't: we move to freeway5 at the next state.\n\nBut what if we had to stay? We don't.\n\nSo I think we are safe.\n\nBut note: there is a car on freeway4 at turn45 that covers 0: the car2: [-3,8] at turn45. So if we were to go up at turn45 and then stay at freeway4 at turn46? But we don't: we go up and then we are at freeway4 at turn46, but then we immediately go up again at turn46 to freeway5. So we are at freeway4 only at turn46, when the car has moved to [1,12].\n\nBut what if we had taken a different action? For example, if we had stayed at turn45 at freeway3: then at turn46 we would still be at freeway3. But freeway3: at turn46 (dt=1): the car: [-44+3, -33+3] = [-41,-30] -> 0 not included. So safe. But then we would have to go up later, which would take more turns. We want minimal.\n\nSo the minimal is 6.\n\nBut wait, what if we try to go up two steps at a time? We can only move one step per turn.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 6 consecutive U moves.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway5 at turn47: we have two cars. The first car: [25,36] -> safe.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". So if there are multiple cars, we check any.\n\nBut in freeway5 at turn47: no car covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6 at turn48: same cars, but now at [37,48] and [85,96]? Wait, for freeway5 at turn47: car1: [1+12*2,12+12*2]=[25,36]. For freeway6 at turn48: the cars are the same? The input says freeway5,6,7,8 have the same set: two cars each. So at turn48, freeway6: dt=3 -> car1: [1+36,12+36]=[37,48] -> safe.\n\nBut wait, what if we had to stay at freeway5 for more than one turn? We don't.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", which is 6, and the sequence.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\". But we don't need to output H, just the sequence? The answer format is only the sequence.\n\nSo we output the sequence for turns 45 to 50.\n\nBut let me see if there is any problem at freeway8 at turn50: we are at freeway8 at turn50? Yes, because at turn49 we did U to go from y=7 to y=8 at turn50. Then at turn50 we are at freeway8. Then we do U at turn50 to go to y=9 at turn51.\n\nAt turn50, we are at freeway8: dt=5 (since T-45=5). For freeway8: car1: [1+12*5,12+12*5]=[61,72] -> safe. car2: [49+60,60+60]=[109,120] -> safe.\n\nSo all clear.\n\nBut what about the cars on freeway1,2,3? We never go back to them. So we don't care.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut wait, there's a car on freeway4: car3: (44,33,right,4). At turn45: [33,44] -> then at turn46: [37,48], etc. But we are at freeway4 at turn46: we checked the cars at turn46: car1: [-35,-24], car2: [1,12], car3: [37,48] -> none covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, at turn45, car3: [33,44] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo I think we are safe.\n\nBut note: the car on freeway4: car2 at turn45: [-3,8] covers 0. So if we had started at freeway4 at turn45, we would have collided. But we started at freeway3.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is six U moves.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 45\\) is 6. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) at each turn to increase the y-coordinate from 3 to 9 in the fewest steps.\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance:\n- **Turn 45 (y=3)**: The car on freeway 3 has span \\([-44, -33]\\) at \\(T=45\\). 0 is not in \\([-44, -33]\\), so safe.\n- **Turn 46 (y=4)**: The cars on freeway 4 at \\(T=46\\) (dt=1):\n  - Car 1: \\([-39 + 4 \\times 1, -28 + 4 \\times 1] = [-35, -24]\\) → 0 not in span.\n  - Car 2: \\([-3 + 4 \\times 1, 8 + 4 \\times 1] = [1, 12]\\) → 0 not in span.\n  - Car 3: \\([33 + 4 \\times 1, 44 + 4 \\times 1] = [37, 48]\\) → 0 not in span.\n- **Turn 47 (y=5)**: The cars on freeway 5 at \\(T=47\\) (dt=2):\n  - Car 1: \\([1 + 12 \\times 2, 12 + 12 \\times 2] = [25, 36]\\) → 0 not in span.\n  - Car 2: \\([49 + 12 \\times 2, 60 + 12 \\times 2] = [73, 84]\\) → 0 not in span.\n- **Turn 48 (y=6)**: The cars on freeway 6 at \\(T=48\\) (dt=3):\n  - Same cars as freeway 5: \\([1 + 12 \\times 3, 12 + 12 \\times 3] = [37, 48]\\) and \\([49 + 12 \\times 3, 60 + 12 \\times 3] = [85, 96]\\) → 0 not in span.\n- **Turn 49 (y=7)**: The cars on freeway 7 at \\(T=49\\) (dt=4):\n  - Same cars: \\([1 + 12 \\times 4, 12 + 12 \\times 4] = [49, 60]\\) and \\([49 + 12 \\times 4, 60 + 12 \\times 4] = [97, 108]\\) → 0 not in span.\n- **Turn 50 (y=8)**: The cars on freeway 8 at \\(T=50\\) (dt=5):\n  - Same cars: \\([1 + 12 \\times 5, 12 + 12 \\times 5] = [61, 72]\\) and \\([49 + 12 \\times 5, 60 + 12 \\times 5] = [109, 120]\\) → 0 not in span.\n\nAfter the action at turn 50, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 51, which is the goal and not a freeway (freeways are y=1 to 8), so no collision check is needed.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The current turn is t1=46, and I start at y=4.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. Each car moves at a constant speed, either left or right. For collision, it happens at turn T only if I'm on that freeway at that turn and the car spans x=0 at that exact turn.\n\nThe note says that if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I might move to y_{T+1} for the next turn. But for collision, at turn T, I'm only checked against the car on y_T at that turn.\n\nAlso, the position is (0, y_t), so x is always 0, and y changes vertically.\n\nI need to minimize H, the number of turns, so I should try to go up as fast as possible, but avoid the cars.\n\nLet me list the freeways and their cars at turn t1=46.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, right-moving, head h=-30, tail τ=-41, speed s=3. Since it's right-moving, the span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-41, -30]. Direction is right, so head is the right end? In the update, for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], so at time T, the left end is τ + s(T-t1), right end is h + s(T-t1).\n\nSimilarly for left-moving.\n\nIn this case, all cars here are right-moving, I think.\n\nFreeway 1: car: h=-30, τ=-41, d=right, s=3. So at turn t1=46, span is [τ, h] = [-41, -30]? But since it's right-moving, the span is from τ to h, with τ < h? τ=-41, h=-30, so -41 < -30, so left end τ, right end h.\n\nThen at time T, position: left end = τ + s(T-t1) = -41 + 3(T-46)\n\nRight end = h + s(T-t1) = -30 + 3(T-46)\n\nCollision if I'm on freeway 1 at turn T and 0 is between left end and right end, i.e., left end <= 0 <= right end.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? \"2 | (-30, -41, right, 3)\" so identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-30, -41, right, 3)\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: (-24, -35, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (48, 37, right, 4)\n\nFor each, h and τ: first car: h=-24? τ=-35? Direction right, so span at t1: [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? τ=-35, h=-24, so left end τ=-35, right end h=-24.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,4), so h=12, τ=1? τ=1, h=12, so [1,12]\n\nThird car: (48,37,right,4), τ=37, h=48, [37,48]\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (24,13,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nFirst car: h=24, τ=13, so [13,24]\n\nSecond car: h=-48, τ=-59, so [-59,-48]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5? \"(24,13,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12)\" yes.\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nNow, I start at y=4 at turn 46. I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, which is above all freeways, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe, but I start at y=4, need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns to go from y=4 to y=9 with moves U (+1), D (-1), S (0), so if I go up every turn, it takes 5 turns: from 4 to 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut I might need to avoid some freeways at certain times due to cars.\n\nSince I can only move one step per turn or stay, I have to pass through each y from 4 to 9, but I might stay or move down temporarily, but that would increase H, so to minimize H, I should avoid moving down or staying if possible, only go up.\n\nBut if there's a collision risk, I might need to stay or move down to wait for a safe time.\n\nMoving down might be necessary only if I need to avoid being on a certain y at a certain turn.\n\nBut since y=0 and y=9 have no cars, I can be there safely.\n\nNow, the key is to check for each freeway and each future turn when a car is at x=0.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find the times when a car spans x=0.\n\nThen, when I plan to be on that freeway, I must avoid those times.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but we only check at integer turns.\n\nLet me denote T as the number of turns after t1. So at time t1 + T, for T=0,1,2,...\n\nAt T=0, turn t1, I am at y=4.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn H.\n\nSince I start at T=0 with y=4, and I want to reach y=9, the minimal H is 5, meaning after 5 actions, at turn t1+5, I am at y=9.\n\nAfter t actions, I am at turn t1 + t, position y_{t1 + t}.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t1, y=4.\n\nAfter 1 action, at t1+1, y=4 + Δy, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1+H, y = y_{t1} + sum of Δy from t=0 to H-1.\n\nSince each Δy is +1,0,-1, to go from 4 to 9, I need a net +5, so minimal H=5 with all U.\n\nBut I might have to take longer if there are collisions.\n\nFirst, let's see if I can do it in 5 turns.\n\nI need to be on y=5 at some turn, y=6 at some turn, etc., up to y=9.\n\nBut y=9 has no cars, so when I reach y=9, it's fine.\n\nThe critical points are when I am on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nBut I start at y=4, which is freeway 4? Freeways are y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4.\n\nAt turn t1, I am on y=4, and I need to check if I collide with cars on y=4 at that turn.\n\nAt turn t1, on freeway 4, cars: let's see if any car spans x=0 at T=0.\n\nFor freeway 4:\n\nFirst car: at t1, span [-35, -24] for x, since τ=-35, h=-24, so from -35 to -24, 0 is not between, since -35 < -24 < 0? -24 is greater than -35 but less than 0? -24 is negative, so -35 to -24, all negative, 0 > -24, so 0 not in [-35,-24].\n\nSimilarly, second car: [1,12], 0 is not in [1,12], since 1>0.\n\nThird car: [37,48], 37>0, not.\n\nSo at T=0, on y=4, no collision.\n\nNow, I need to move to higher y.\n\nTo go to y=9 in 5 turns, I need to increase y by 1 each turn: so actions U,U,U,U,U.\n\nThen, I will be on y=4 at T=0, y=5 at T=1, y=6 at T=2, y=7 at T=3, y=8 at T=4, y=9 at T=5.\n\nAt T=5, y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nNow, I need to check for each of these, whether on that y at that turn, there is a car at x=0.\n\nFirst, at T=0, y=4: we saw no car at x=0, safe.\n\nAt T=1, y=5: freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 cars: at t1 + T, T=1.\n\nFirst, car positions at time t1 + T.\n\nt1=46, so time from now is T.\n\nFor freeway 5: cars (24,13,right,12) and (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nFirst car: τ=13, h=24, s=12, right-moving.\n\nAt time t1 + T, left end = τ + s(T) = 13 + 12T\n\nRight end = h + s(T) = 24 + 12T\n\nCollision if left end <= 0 <= right end, i.e., 13 + 12T <= 0 <= 24 + 12T\n\nBut 13 + 12T <=0 implies 12T <= -13, T <= -13/12 ≈ -1.083, since T>=0, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 24 + 12T always true for T>=0, but the inequality must hold: 13+12T <=0 and 0<=24+12T.\n\n13+12T <=0 only for T negative, so never true for T>=0.\n\nSecond car: τ=-59, h=-48, s=12, right-moving.\n\nLeft end = τ + sT = -59 + 12T\n\nRight end = h + sT = -48 + 12T\n\nCollision if -59 + 12T <= 0 <= -48 + 12T\n\nThat is, -59 + 12T <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 12T\n\nFirst: -59 + 12T <=0 => 12T <=59 => T <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so T <=4 since integer.\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 12T => 48 <= 12T => T >= 4\n\nSo for T=4, both: -59+48= -11 <=0? -11 <=0 true, and 0 <= -48+48=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nAt T=4, left end = -59 +12*4 = -59+48= -11\n\nRight end = -48 +48=0\n\nSo 0 <= right end=0, so yes, 0 is included, since right end is 0.\n\nThe span is [left, right], inclusive I assume.\n\nSo at T=4, for second car, span [-11, 0], so x=0 is included.\n\nThus, collision if on freeway 5 at T=4.\n\nNow, back to my plan: at T=1, I am on y=5.\n\nFor y=5 at T=1: is there collision?\n\nT=1, not 4, so for second car: at T=1, left end = -59 +12*1 = -59+12= -47\n\nRight end = -48 +12= -36\n\nBoth negative, 0 not in [-47,-36], since -36<0.\n\nFirst car: as above, no collision ever for T>=0.\n\nSo at T=1, on y=5, no collision.\n\nNow at T=2, y=6: freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 has same cars as 5: (24,13,right,12) and (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nSimilarly, second car collision at T=4, as above.\n\nAt T=2: left end = -59 +12*2 = -59+24= -35\n\nRight end = -48 +24= -24\n\n0 not in [-35,-24], safe.\n\nFirst car no issue.\n\nAt T=3, y=7: freeway 7, same cars.\n\nAt T=3: left end = -59 +36= -23? 12*3=36, -59+36= -23\n\nRight end = -48+36= -12\n\n0 not in [-23,-12], safe.\n\nAt T=4, y=8: freeway 8.\n\nAt T=4, for the second car, span [-11,0], so x=0 is occupied, collision if on y=8 at T=4.\n\nIn my plan, at T=4, I am on y=8, so I would collide.\n\nProblem.\n\nSo with all U, at T=4, on y=8, collision with car on freeway 8.\n\nThus, cannot go directly in 5 turns.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=8 at T=4.\n\nSince H=5 requires being on y=8 at T=4, but that is unsafe, so minimal H must be greater than 5.\n\nPerhaps I can stay or move down to delay.\n\nBut let's see the options.\n\nFirst, I need to handle freeway 8 at T=4.\n\nThe car is only at x=0 at exactly T=4 for this car? Let's see when it spans x=0.\n\nFrom above, for freeway 5,6,7,8, all have the same car configuration, since freeways 5 to 8 all have identical cars: (24,13,right,12) and (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 all have the same two cars.\n\nNow for each, the dangerous time is when T such that for the second car, -59 +12T <= 0 <= -48 +12T\n\nAs before, T=4.\n\nAt T=4, left end -59+48= -11, right end -48+48=0, so [ -11, 0], includes 0.\n\nAt other times? For example T=3: -59+36= -23, -48+36= -12, [ -23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nT=5: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nT=4 only.\n\nSimilarly, for the first car, never at x=0.\n\nSo for freeways 5,6,7,8, at exactly T=4, if I am on that freeway, I collide with the second car.\n\nNow, in the path to y=9, I need to be on one of these freeways at some point, but I can avoid being on them at T=4.\n\nSince I start at y=4 at T=0, and need to reach y=9.\n\nThe freeways I must cross are y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=4 at T=0 is safe, as we saw.\n\ny=5 at T=1: safe, as above.\n\ny=6 at T=2: safe.\n\ny=7 at T=3: safe.\n\ny=8 at T=4: unsafe.\n\nBut if I can be on y=8 at a different time, or skip it, but I can't skip, since I have to go through each y sequentially, but I can stay or move down to change the timing.\n\nFor example, if at some turn I stay or move down, I delay reaching higher y.\n\nSo for y=8, I need to avoid T=4.\n\nThe dangerous time is only T=4 for y=5,6,7,8? No, for each freeway, the collision depends on the car on that specific freeway, but since all freeways 5-8 have identical cars, they all have danger at T=4.\n\nBut for a given freeway, say y=5, the car is on y=5, and collision if on y=5 at T=4.\n\nSimilarly for y=6, on y=6 at T=4, etc.\n\nIn my path, I am on different freeways at different times.\n\nTo avoid collision, I need that for each freeway I am on, at that time, no car at x=0.\n\nSpecifically, for freeway 8, if I am on it at T=4, collision.\n\nBut I can be on freeway 8 at another time.\n\nFor freeway 8, cars are the same, so at T=4, unsafe.\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nFor example, at T=3, on freeway 8: span [-23,-12], no 0.\n\nT=5: [1,12], no 0.\n\nSimilarly for y=7, etc.\n\nNow, in the minimal path, I might need to reach y=8 earlier or later.\n\nSince I start at y=4 at T=0.\n\nIf I go up immediately, I reach y=5 at T=1, y=6 at T=2, y=7 at T=3, y=8 at T=4, which is bad.\n\nTo avoid y=8 at T=4, I could, for example, stay at y=4 for one turn, then go up.\n\nStart at T=0, y=4.\n\nIf I do S at first turn, then at T=1, still y=4.\n\nThen I can go up to y=5 at T=2, y=6 at T=3, y=7 at T=4, y=8 at T=5, y=9 at T=6.\n\nNow, at T=5, y=8: is it safe?\n\nT=5, on freeway 8.\n\nCars: second car, left end = -59 +12*5 = -59+60=1\n\nRight end = -48+60=12\n\nSpan [1,12], 0 not included, safe.\n\nFirst car: [13+60,24+60]? At T=5, left end 13+12*5=13+60=73, right end 24+60=84, far away.\n\nSo at T=5, y=8 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 at T=6 safe.\n\nBut what about other points.\n\nIn this sequence: actions: first S (stay), then U,U,U,U,U.\n\nAfter actions: let's list turns.\n\nAt T=0 (t1+0), y=4, action a_{t1} = S? a_t for turn t.\n\nThe action is taken at each turn.\n\nAt turn t, I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nPosition at turn t is (0, y_t).\n\nAt turn t1=46, y=4.\n\nI choose a_{46}, then y_{47} = y_{46} + Δy_{46}\n\nThen at turn 47, I choose a_{47}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1+H, y_{t1+H} should be 9.\n\nH is the number of actions.\n\nIn terms of T: at time t1 + T, position y_{t1+T}\n\nAfter T actions, I am at turn t1 + T.\n\nDefine: after k actions, I am at turn t1 + k, position y_{t1 + k}\n\nStart: k=0, turn t1, y=4\n\nAfter 1 action: k=1, turn t1+1, y= y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\nEtc.\n\nI need y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nFor minimal H.\n\nWith all U: actions U from k=0 to 4: so after 5 actions, y=4+5=9 at turn t1+5.\n\nBut as above, at turn t1+4, y=8, which is unsafe if cars at x=0.\n\nIn the stay option: at k=0, action S: Δy=0, so at turn t1+1, y=4\n\nThen k=1, action U: to y=5 at turn t1+2\n\nk=2, U: to y=6 at turn t1+3\n\nk=3, U: to y=7 at turn t1+4\n\nk=4, U: to y=8 at turn t1+5\n\nk=5, U: to y=9 at turn t1+6\n\nNow, at each point:\n\nAt turn t1+0: y=4, freeway 4, safe as before.\n\nAt turn t1+1: y=4, freeway 4? After action S, at turn t1+1, y=4, same as before.\n\nFreeway 4 at T=1: time t1+1.\n\nCars on freeway 4: let's see positions.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,4) → τ=-35, h=-24, s=4\n\nAt time t1 + T, left end = τ + s T = -35 + 4T\n\nRight end = h + s T = -24 + 4T\n\nCollision if -35 +4T <=0 <= -24 +4T\n\nWhich requires -35+4T <=0 and 0<= -24+4T\n\nFirst: -35+4T <=0 => 4T <=35 => T<=8.75\n\nSecond: 0<= -24+4T => 24<=4T => T>=6\n\nSo for T=6,7,8\n\nT=6: left -35+24= -11, right -24+24=0, so [ -11,0], includes 0.\n\nT=7: left -35+28= -7, right -24+28=4, [ -7,4], includes 0.\n\nT=8: left -35+32= -3, right -24+32=8, [ -3,8], includes 0.\n\nAt other times not.\n\nBut at T=1, left end = -35+4*1= -31, right= -24+4= -20, both neg, no 0.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4) → τ=1, h=12, s=4\n\nLeft end =1 +4T, right=12+4T\n\n1+4T <=0? 4T<=-1 impossible, so no collision.\n\nThird car: (48,37,right,4) → τ=37, h=48, left=37+4T, right=48+4T, both positive for T>=0, no 0.\n\nSo for freeway 4, danger at T=6,7,8.\n\nAt T=1, safe.\n\nIn my sequence, at turn t1+1, T=1, y=4, safe.\n\nThen at turn t1+2, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 at T=2.\n\nCars: as before.\n\nSecond car: left end = -59 +12*2 = -59+24= -35\n\nRight end = -48+24= -24, no 0.\n\nFirst car: 13+24=37, 24+24=48, no issue.\n\nSafe.\n\nAt turn t1+3, y=6, freeway 6 at T=3.\n\nSecond car: left -59+36= -23, right -48+36= -12, no 0. Safe.\n\nAt turn t1+4, y=7, freeway 7 at T=4.\n\nNow, freeway 7 at T=4: cars same as others.\n\nSecond car: left -59+48= -11, right -48+48=0, so [ -11,0], includes 0. Collision!\n\nI forgot about freeway 7.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn t1+4, I am on y=7, freeway 7.\n\nAt T=4, for freeway 7, the second car has span [-11,0], so collision.\n\nOh, problem.\n\nBecause freeways 5,6,7,8 all have the same cars, so at T=4, all of them have a car at x=0.\n\nSo if I am on any of y=5,6,7,8 at T=4, I collide.\n\nIn the all-up case, at T=4 on y=8, collide.\n\nIn the stay-then-up case, at T=4 on y=7, still collide, since y=7 at T=4.\n\nIn fact, for any y from 5 to 8, if on it at T=4, collide.\n\nBut I need to be on some y at each turn.\n\nTo avoid collision at T=4, I must not be on any freeway from 5 to 8 at T=4.\n\nThat means at turn t1+4, I must be on y=4 or y=9 or y=0, but y=9 is goal, y=0 is bottom.\n\ny=4 is possible.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 or y=0.\n\nBut y=0 might be safe, no cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all dangerous times for each freeway.\n\nStart with freeway 1: cars: (-30,-41,right,3)\n\nLeft end = -41 +3T\n\nRight end = -30 +3T\n\nCollision if -41+3T <=0 <= -30+3T\n\n-41+3T <=0 => 3T<=41 => T<=13.666\n\n0<= -30+3T => 3T>=30 => T>=10\n\nSo T=10,11,12,13\n\nT=10: left -41+30= -11, right -30+30=0, [ -11,0]\n\nT=11: left -41+33= -8, right -30+33=3, [-8,3] include 0\n\nT=12: left -41+36= -5, right -30+36=6, [-5,6]\n\nT=13: left -41+39= -2, right -30+39=9, [-2,9]\n\nInclude 0.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1, since identical cars, so same dangerous times T=10 to 13.\n\nFreeway 3: same, T=10 to 13.\n\nFreeway 4: as before, cars: first car danger T=6,7,8\n\nBut for freeway 4, we have three cars, but only the first one can have 0 in span.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,4) danger at T=6,7,8\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4) no danger\n\nThird car: (48,37,right,4) no danger\n\nSo freeway 4 dangerous at T=6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 5: cars (24,13,right,12) and (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nFirst car: left 13+12T, right 24+12T, 13+12T <=0? impossible, no danger.\n\nSecond car: left -59+12T, right -48+12T\n\nDanger when -59+12T <=0 <= -48+12T\n\n-59+12T <=0 => 12T<=59 => T<=4.916, T<=4\n\n0<= -48+12T => 12T>=48 => T>=4\n\nSo T=4 only.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6,7,8: all have the same, danger only at T=4.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI need to go from y=4 to y=9.\n\nTo minimize H, I want to take as few actions as possible, but with detours.\n\nThe dangerous times are T=4 for y=5,6,7,8 and T=6,7,8 for y=4.\n\nAlso, for y=1,2,3, dangerous at T=10-13, but since I am starting from y=4 and going up, I might not go down, so y=1,2,3 might not be relevant, unless I move down.\n\nBut moving down might increase H, so probably not efficient.\n\nFirst, can I reach y=9 in H=5? As before, I must be on y=8 at T=4 or earlier, but T=4 is the only dangerous time for upper freeways, and at T=4, if on y=8, collide. If I reach y=8 earlier, but I start at y=4 at T=0, I can't reach y=8 before T=4 with only up moves. Minimal to go from 4 to 8 is 4 up moves, at T=4.\n\nSimilarly, to y=9 at T=5.\n\nSo impossible in 5 turns because I must be on some y=5,6,7,8 at T=4, but all are dangerous at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, y=5,6,7,8 all have collision risk, and since I must be on one of them if I am between 5 and 8, but I could be on y=4 or y=9.\n\nAt T=4, if I am on y=4 or y=9, safe.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, if I reach y=9 at T=4, that would be great, but from y=4, I need +5, so at T=4, I can be at most y=8 with 4 up moves.\n\ny_{t1+4} <= 4 +4 =8, since each move +1 max.\n\nSo at T=4, y <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be below 4 unless I move down, but moving down would make me farther from 9.\n\nSo at T=4, I must be on some y from 0 to 8, but y=0 to 3 might be safe or not, but let's see.\n\ny=0: no freeway, probably safe, but I start from 4, going to 9, moving down to 0 would take extra turns.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at T=4: but freeway 4 is dangerous at T=6,7,8, not at T=4, so y=4 at T=4 is safe.\n\nAt T=4, freeway 4: as above, dangerous only at T=6,7,8, so at T=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at T=4: freeway 3, dangerous at T=10-13, so at T=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2,1,0 all safe at T=4.\n\nBut if I am on y=4 at T=4, then I can proceed up later.\n\nBut to minimize H, I need to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nH=5 is impossible, so next is H=6.\n\nWith H=6, I can reach y=9 at T=6.\n\nI need to have y_{t1+6} =9.\n\nNow, the net change must be +5, so with 6 actions, I have one extra action that could be S or D.\n\nIf I use S, I stay one turn, net +5 in 6 turns.\n\nIf I use D, net +4, but I need +5, so not enough, so I must use S or extra U but I need exactly +5, so with 6 actions, I must have five U and one S, or four U and two S, etc., but to minimize H, I should have as many U as possible, so five U and one S, net +5.\n\nSimilarly, I could have a D and then extra U, but that would be, for example, four U and one D and one U, but net +4, not +5; let's see: actions: if I do D once, I go down, then need two U to compensate, but net for that: from some y, D then U U: -1 +1 +1 = +1, same as S then U, but takes an extra action.\n\nTo have net +5 with 6 actions, the only way is to have five U and one S, or combinations but S is better than D, since D moves away.\n\nSo best to have five U and one S.\n\nNow, I need to place the S somewhere to avoid being on dangerous y at dangerous times.\n\nDangerous times: T=4 for y=5,6,7,8; and T=6,7,8 for y=4.\n\nAlso, T=10-13 for lower, but probably not relevant if I go up.\n\nNow, with one S, I can delay the ascent.\n\nStart at T=0, y=4.\n\nI need to insert one stay.\n\nPossible places to stay:\n\nOption 1: Stay at y=4 at some point.\n\nFor example, at T=0, action S: then at T=1, y=4.\n\nThen actions U,U,U,U,U: so from T=1 to T=2, y=5; T=2 to T=3, y=6; T=3 to T=4, y=7; T=4 to T=5, y=8; T=5 to T=6, y=9.\n\nTurns: after actions.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t1+k.\n\nk=0: turn t1+0, y=4\n\nAction a0: suppose S, then y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} +0 =4\n\nThen at turn t1+1, y=4\n\nAction a1: U, y_{t1+2} =4+1=5\n\nTurn t1+2, y=5\n\nAction a2: U, y_{t1+3} =5+1=6\n\nTurn t1+3, y=6\n\nAction a3: U, y_{t1+4} =6+1=7\n\nTurn t1+4, y=7\n\nAction a4: U, y_{t1+5} =7+1=8\n\nTurn t1+5, y=8\n\nAction a5: U, y_{t1+6} =8+1=9\n\nTurn t1+6, y=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt turn t1+0 (T=0): y=4, freeway 4, safe as before.\n\nAt turn t1+1 (T=1): y=4, freeway 4, at T=1, as before, safe.\n\nAt turn t1+2 (T=2): y=5, freeway 5, at T=2, second car span [-35,-24], no 0, safe.\n\nAt turn t1+3 (T=3): y=6, freeway 6, at T=3, second car [-23,-12], no 0, safe.\n\nAt turn t1+4 (T=4): y=7, freeway 7, at T=4, second car span [-11,0], includes 0, collision! Not safe.\n\nSame problem as before.\n\nI could stay later.\n\nFor example, go up first, then stay at some point.\n\nStart at T=0, y=4, action U: to y=5 at turn t1+1\n\nThen at turn t1+1, y=5\n\nIf I stay here, action S: y_{t1+2} =5+0=5\n\nThen turn t1+2, y=5\n\nThen U to y=6 at t1+3, and so on.\n\nBut at T=4, I will be on y=7 or something.\n\nLet's list:\n\nk=0: turn t1+0, y=4, action U → y_{t1+1}=5\n\nk=1: turn t1+1, y=5, action S? → y_{t1+2}=5\n\nk=2: turn t1+2, y=5, action U → y_{t1+3}=6\n\nk=3: turn t1+3, y=6, action U → y_{t1+4}=7\n\nk=4: turn t1+4, y=7, action U → y_{t1+5}=8\n\nk=5: turn t1+5, y=8, action U → y_{t1+6}=9\n\nNow at turn t1+4 (T=4), y=7, freeway 7, at T=4, collision with car.\n\nStill problem.\n\nIf I stay at y=6 or higher, but at T=4, if I am on y=6,7,8, all dangerous.\n\nUnless I am not on those at T=4.\n\nBut with the path, at T=4, I am at y=7 in this case.\n\nI could stay at y=4 longer, but I need to insert one stay.\n\nAnother idea: since the danger is at T=4, I can be on y=4 at T=4.\n\nFor example, start by going up to y=5 or something, but let's plan the sequence so that at T=4, I am on y=4.\n\nAt T=4, y=4 is safe.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9 at H=6, so after 6 actions, at turn t1+6, y=9.\n\nIf at T=4, turn t1+4, I am at y=4, that means I have not moved up much.\n\nFor example, suppose I stay at y=4 for the first few turns.\n\nAt T=0, y=4\n\nIf I do nothing for 4 turns, but I need to go up.\n\nLet me define the position at each turn.\n\nAt turn t: y_t\n\nt=46: y=4\n\nI need y_{46+H} =9\n\nWith minimal H.\n\nThe change in y: from t=46 to t=46+H, y increases by 5.\n\nThe number of U actions minus number of D actions must be 5, and total actions H.\n\nLet U be number of U, D number of D, S number of S, U + D + S = H, and U - D =5.\n\nThen from U - D =5 and U + D + S = H, add them: 2U + S = H +5, so H = 2U + S -5.\n\nSince U >=5, H >=5.\n\nMinimal when U=5, S=0, H=5, impossible.\n\nNext, U=5, S=1, then H=2*5 +1 -5=10+1-5=6.\n\nOr U=5, D=0, S=1, H=6.\n\nIf U=6, D=1, then U-D=5, H=U+D+S=6+1+S, but S>=0, H>=7, larger than 6, so worse.\n\nSimilarly, U=4, D=0, S=1, U-D=4<5, not enough.\n\nU=4, D=0, S=1, net +4, not +5.\n\nSo only possibility with H=6 is U=5, S=1, D=0.\n\nI must have five U and one S.\n\nNow, I need to place the S at some point to avoid being on y=5,6,7,8 at T=4.\n\nT=4 is turn t1+4.\n\nAt turn t1+4, I must not be on y=5,6,7,8.\n\nSo I must be on y<=4 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 impossible at T=4, so y<=4.\n\ny=4,3,2,1,0.\n\nNow, y=4 is possible, and safe at T=4, as we saw.\n\nSimilarly, lower are safe but farther.\n\nSo best to be on y=4 at T=4.\n\nThen from there, I can go up to y=9 by T=6.\n\nAt T=4, y=4.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9 in two more turns, but impossible, from y=4 to y=9 in two turns, max +2, to y=6.\n\nAfter T=4, I have two actions to reach y=9 at T=6, but from y=4, after two U, to y=6 at T=6, not 9.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at T=6.\n\nIf at T=4, y=4, then after two actions, at T=6, y must be 9, so I need +5 in two actions, impossible, since max +2.\n\nContradiction.\n\nAt turn t1+4, y=4.\n\nThen after action at turn t1+4, y_{t1+5} = y_{t1+4} + Δy\n\nThen at turn t1+5, y_{t1+5}\n\nThen action, y_{t1+6}\n\nI need y_{t1+6} =9.\n\nSo if at turn t1+4, y=4, then to have y_{t1+6}=9, I need y_{t1+5} and y_{t1+6} such that from 4 to 9 in two steps.\n\nPossible sequences: for example, U then U: to 5 then 6, not 9.\n\nOr U then S: to 5 then 5.\n\nCannot reach 9.\n\nThe only way is to be higher before T=4.\n\nBut at T=4, I need to be low.\n\nLet me set the position at T=4 to y=4.\n\nThen from T=4 to T=6, I need to go to y=9, which requires at least three steps: from 4 to 7 in two steps? No.\n\nFrom turn t1+4 to turn t1+6, that's two turns: at turn t1+4, position y.\n\nThen after first action, turn t1+5, y + Δy1\n\nAfter second action, turn t1+6, y + Δy1 + Δy2 =9\n\nSince |Δy|<=1, y + Δy1 + Δy2 <= y +1 +1 = y+2\n\nSet equal to 9, so y+2 >=9, y>=7.\n\nSimilarly, y + Δy1 + Δy2 >= y-2, but since 9>4, y>=7.\n\nSo at turn t1+4, y must be at least 7 to reach 9 at t1+6.\n\nSimilarly, at most 7, if y=7, then U U to 9.\n\nIf y=8, U to 9 or S to 8 then U to9, etc.\n\nBut at T=4, if y=7 or 8, it is dangerous, as we saw.\n\ny=7 or 8 at T=4 on freeway 7 or 8, collision.\n\nBut y=6 at T=4 also collision, y=5 collision.\n\nOnly y<=4 or y=9 safe, but y=9 impossible.\n\nSo at T=4, I must have y<=4 to be safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at T=6, from y<=4 at T=4, impossible to reach y=9 in two steps.\n\nThus, with H=6, it is impossible to avoid the problem, because I must be at y<=4 at T=4 to be safe, but then cannot reach y=9 at T=6.\n\nH=6 means after 6 actions, at turn t1+6, y=9.\n\nThe position at turn t1+4 is before that.\n\nLet me denote the turn.\n\nTurn t: for t from 46 to 46+H.\n\nAt turn 46+H, y=9.\n\nAt turn 46+4, I need to be on a safe y.\n\nWith H=6, turn 46+6=52, y=9.\n\nAt turn 46+4=50, I need y_50 to be safe, i.e., not on y=5,6,7,8 or on them but not dangerous, but at T=4, all y=5-8 are dangerous.\n\nT=4 is turn t1+4 =46+4=50.\n\nAt turn 50, if I am on y=5,6,7,8, I collide.\n\nSo I must be on y<=4 or y=9.\n\ny=9 impossible at turn 50 for H=6.\n\nSo y<=4.\n\nThen from turn 50, y<=4, to turn 52, y=9.\n\nFrom y<=4 to y=9 in two turns, impossible because each turn y changes by at most 1, so at turn 52, y <= 4 +2 =6 <9.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, H=6 is impossible.\n\nNext, try H=7.\n\nWith H=7, I can have U=5, S=2 or U=6, D=1, etc., but net +5.\n\nMinimal actions: U=5, S=2, H=7, net +5.\n\nU=6, D=1, net +5, H=7.\n\nU=6,D=1 is same as U=5,S=1 plus an extra U and S, but H larger? U=6,D=1,S=0, H=7, net +5.\n\nOr U=5,S=2, H=7.\n\nU=5,S=2 has two stays, U=6,D=1 has one down and one extra up.\n\nBut U=6,D=1 might be better if I can use the down to avoid something.\n\nFirst, with U=5,S=2, I can spend more time at safe positions.\n\nNow, H=7, so at turn t1+7, y=9.\n\nAt turn t1+4=50, I must be on y<=4 to be safe.\n\nThen from turn 50, y<=4, to turn 57, y=9.\n\nFrom turn 50 to turn 57, that's 7 turns? Turns: turn 50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57.\n\nFrom turn 50 to turn 57, 7 steps, but positions.\n\nAt turn 50, y50\n\nThen after actions, y51, y52, ..., y57=9.\n\nNumber of actions from turn 50 to 57 is 7 actions, but since we have H actions from t1, let's think differently.\n\nSince at turn 50, I must have y50 <=4.\n\nThen I need to go from y50 <=4 to y57=9, so net +5 to +9, depending on y50.\n\nIf y50=4, need +5 in 7 actions, possible with U=5,S=2.\n\nSimilarly, if y50=3, need +6, etc., but worse.\n\nBest to have y50=4.\n\nThen from there, go to y=9 in 3 steps? From turn 50 to turn 57, 7 turns, but 7 actions.\n\nFrom turn 50 to turn 57, there are 7 actions: at turn 50, action a50 affects y51, etc., up to a56 affects y57.\n\nBut y57 is after 7 actions from t1? Let's index.\n\nSet t1=46.\n\nTurn 46: y=4\n\nAfter 7 actions, turn 53? Let's calculate.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 46+k.\n\nFor k=7, turn 46+7=53, y=9.\n\nH=7, at turn 46+7=53, y=9.\n\nAt turn 46+4=50, I need y50 <=4.\n\nThen from turn 50 to turn 53, I need to go from y50 <=4 to y53=9.\n\nNumber of actions from turn 50 to 53: at turn 50, action a50 determines y51; a51 determines y52; a52 determines y53.\n\nSo three actions to go from y50 to y53.\n\nIf y50 <=4, y53=9, so need net increase at least 5 in 3 actions, impossible, max +3.\n\ny53 <= y50 +3 <=4+3=7<9.\n\nCannot reach 9.\n\nProblem.\n\nGeneral: at turn t1+4, y must be <=4.\n\nAt turn t1+H, y=9.\n\nNumber of turns from t1+4 to t1+H is H-4 turns.\n\nPositions from turn t1+4 to turn t1+H.\n\nAt turn t1+4, y <=4\n\nAt turn t1+H, y=9\n\nThe number of actions between: from turn t1+4 to turn t1+H, there are H-4 actions.\n\nEach action can increase y by at most 1, so y_{t1+H} <= y_{t1+4} + (H-4)\n\nSet y_{t1+H} =9, y_{t1+4} <=4, so 9 <= 4 + (H-4) + something, inequality:\n\ny_{t1+H} <= y_{t1+4} + (H-4)\n\n9 <= y_{t1+4} + (H-4) <= 4 + (H-4) = H\n\nSo 9 <= H\n\nThus H >=9\n\nSimilarly, if y_{t1+4} <4, H must be larger.\n\nBut minimal when y_{t1+4} =4, then 9 <= 4 + (H-4) = H, so H>=9.\n\nThus minimal H is 9.\n\nIs that right?\n\ny_{t1+H} <= y_{t1+4} + (H-4)\n\nSince each step max +1.\n\nSo 9 <= y_{t1+4} + (H-4) <= 4 + (H-4) = H\n\nSo 9 <= H, thus H >=9.\n\nAnd equality if y_{t1+4} =4 and all actions U from there.\n\nSo with H=9, I can have y_{t1+4} =4, then U,U,U,U,U to reach y=9 at t1+9.\n\nNow, need to ensure that at t1+4, y=4 is safe, and no other collisions.\n\nFirst, at t1+4, T=4, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nIs freeway 4 safe at T=4?\n\nEarlier, for freeway 4, danger at T=6,7,8.\n\nAt T=4, safe, as left end -35+4*4= -35+16= -19, right end -24+16= -8, both neg, no 0.\n\nSimilarly, other cars no issue.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen from there, I go up to y=9 in 5 turns.\n\nBut I need to specify the actions before t1+4 to stay at y=4.\n\nFrom turn t1 to t1+4, I need to be at y=4 at turn t1+4.\n\nAt turn t1, y=4.\n\nIf I do nothing, stay for 4 turns, then at turn t1+4, y=4.\n\nActions: for 4 actions, all S.\n\nThen at turn t1+4, y=4.\n\nThen from there, 5 U actions to go to y=9 at turn t1+9.\n\nBut H=9 actions.\n\nNow, check for collisions during the stay and during the up.\n\nFirst, during stay at y=4 from turn t1 to t1+4.\n\nTurn t1 to t1+3, since at turn t1+4, it's after the stay, but position.\n\nAt turn t1: y=4, safe as before.\n\nAt turn t1+1: y=4, freeway 4 at T=1, safe.\n\nAt turn t1+2: y=4, T=2, freeway 4: left end -35+4*2= -35+8= -27, right -24+8= -16, no 0, safe.\n\nAt turn t1+3: y=4, T=3, freeway 4: left -35+12= -23, right -24+12= -12, no 0, safe.\n\nAt turn t1+4: y=4, T=4, as above, safe.\n\nThen action at turn t1+4: U, to y=5 at turn t1+5\n\nAt turn t1+5: y=5, freeway 5, T=5\n\nNow T=5, freeway 5: second car, left -59+12*5= -59+60=1, right -48+60=12, span [1,12], 0 not included, safe.\n\nFirst car no issue.\n\nThen action U at turn t1+5: to y=6 at turn t1+6\n\nAt turn t1+6: y=6, freeway 6, T=6\n\nT=6, freeway 6: same cars, second car left -59+72=13? 12*6=72, -59+72=13, right -48+72=24, [13,24], no 0, safe.\n\nThen action U to y=7 at turn t1+7\n\nAt turn t1+7: y=7, freeway 7, T=7\n\nT=7, freeway 7: second car left -59+84=25? 12*7=84, -59+84=25, right -48+84=36, [25,36], no 0.\n\nSafe.\n\nAction U to y=8 at turn t1+8\n\nAt turn t1+8: y=8, freeway 8, T=8\n\nT=8, second car left -59+96=37, right -48+96=48, [37,48], no 0.\n\nSafe.\n\nAction U to y=9 at turn t1+9\n\nAt turn t1+9: y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nNow, what about other freeways? For example, when going up, I am on each freeway only once, at T=5 for y=5, T=6 for y=6, etc., all safe as above.\n\nBut is there any other danger? For example, at T=6,7,8 for y=4, but I am not on y=4 at those times.\n\nAt T=6, I am on y=6, etc.\n\nSimilarly, lower freeways no issue.\n\nSo this works with H=9.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nEarlier we have H>=9, so 9 is minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm H=9.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier if I move up a bit before T=4.\n\nBut at T=4, I must be <=4, so if I go up to y=3 or something, but y=3 at T=4 is safe, but then from there to y=9, it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, if at T=4, y=3, then to y=9, need +6, with H actions from start, but H=9 with y=4 at T=4 gives +5 from there.\n\nIf y=3 at T=4, need +6 to y=9, so with more actions.\n\nWorse.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, even worse.\n\nSo H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, I used 4 S at the beginning, then 5 U.\n\nBut I have only two S? No, in the net, for H=9, I have U=5, S=4, since I stay 4 times, then up 5 times, net +5.\n\nU=5, S=4, H=9.\n\nI could have fewer stays if I go down and up, but that would require more actions.\n\nFor example, go down to y=3, then up, but net same or worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, minimal H is 9.\n\nNow, the actions.\n\nFrom turn t1=46 to t1+8 for actions, position at t1+9.\n\nActions from turn 46 to 54, position at 55? Let's list.\n\nTurn 46: position y=4, I choose action.\n\nTo stay, I choose S.\n\nAfter action, position at turn 47: y=4 (since S)\n\nTurn 47: y=4, action S, position turn 48: y=4\n\nTurn 48: y=4, action S, position turn 49: y=4\n\nTurn 49: y=4, action S, position turn 50: y=4\n\nNow turn 50: y=4, action U, position turn 51: y=5\n\nTurn 51: y=5, action U, position turn 52: y=6\n\nTurn 52: y=6, action U, position turn 53: y=7\n\nTurn 53: y=7, action U, position turn 54: y=8\n\nTurn 54: y=8, action U, position turn 55: y=9\n\nH=9 actions, from turn 46 to 54, position at turn 55=9.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to output actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nH=9, actions at t=46 to 54.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut let me confirm if all safe.\n\nAt turn 46: y=4, freeway 4, T=0, safe\n\nTurn 47: y=4, freeway 4, T=1, safe (as computed)\n\nTurn 48: y=4, freeway 4, T=2, safe\n\nTurn 49: y=4, freeway 4, T=3, safe\n\nTurn 50: y=4, freeway 4, T=4, safe\n\nTurn 51: y=5, freeway 5, T=5, second car [1,12], no 0, safe\n\nTurn 52: y=6, freeway 6, T=6, second car [13,24], no 0, safe\n\nTurn 53: y=7, freeway 7, T=7, second car [25,36], no 0, safe\n\nTurn 54: y=8, freeway 8, T=8, second car [37,48], no 0, safe\n\nThen turn 55: y=9, safe.\n\nNo other turns.\n\nBut freeway 4 has danger at T=6,7,8, but at those times, I am not on y=4, I am on y=6,7,8, which are safe at those T.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways no issue.\n\nSo it works.\n\nNow, the actions: from turn 46 to 54: actions S,S,S,S,U,U,U,U,U\n\nBut turn 46 to 54 is 9 actions.\n\nIn sequence:\n\nTurn 46: S\n\nTurn 47: S\n\nTurn 48: S\n\nTurn 49: S\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nThen at turn 55, y=9.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions from t1 to t1+H-1, which is 46 to 54.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut is there a shorter way? Earlier we have H>=9, so no.\n\nPerhaps I can start by moving up a bit, but at T=4 I need to be <=4, so if I go to y=5 before, but then I need to come down or stay, but at T=4, if I am on y=5, it is dangerous.\n\nFor example, suppose at T=0, I go U to y=5 at turn 47.\n\nThen at turn 47, y=5, which is safe at T=1, since T=1 for y=5: earlier, at T=1, safe.\n\nBut I need to be at y<=4 at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, turn 50, I need y<=4.\n\nBut from y=5 at turn 47, to y<=4 at turn 50, I need to move down or stay, but if I move down, it takes extra actions.\n\nFor example, from turn 47 y=5, I can go down to y=4 at some point.\n\nBut to be at y<=4 at turn 50.\n\nSuppose at turn 47, y=5, action D to y=4 at turn 48.\n\nThen turn 48, y=4.\n\nThen I need to stay until turn 50.\n\nAction S at turn 48, to y=4 at turn 49.\n\nThen at turn 49, y=4, action S to y=4 at turn 50.\n\nThen at turn 50, y=4, safe.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9 from turn 50.\n\nWith actions from turn 50 to later.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at turn 55, same as before, with 5 U from turn 50.\n\nBut I used more actions: from start, at turn 46: action U to y=5 at 47\n\nTurn 47: action D to y=4 at 48\n\nTurn 48: action S to y=4 at 49\n\nTurn 49: action S to y=4 at 50\n\nThen turn 50: U to y=5 at 51, etc., same as before but with extra D and S, so more actions, H larger.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo the first plan is best.\n\nThus, minimal H=9.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 46: S\n\nTurn 47: S\n\nTurn 48: S\n\nTurn 49: S\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, but H=9, t from 0 to 8.\n\nt1=46.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 46: a_{46} = S\n\nTurn 47: a_{47} = S\n\nTurn 48: a_{48} = S\n\nTurn 49: a_{49} = S\n\nTurn 50: a_{50} = U\n\nTurn 51: a_{51} = U\n\nTurn 52: a_{52} = U\n\nTurn 53: a_{53} = U\n\nTurn 54: a_{54} = U\n\nIn the output, it should be for turns starting from t1.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write the sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 46\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 9.

We need to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y remains). The y-coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, the x-coordinate 0 is inside the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant: When moving from y to y' at turn T, at the moment of the move (turn T) the player is still on y. Then at turn T+1, the player is on y'. So at turn T, we check the freeway y (the starting freeway) for collision, and at turn T+1 we check y' (the new freeway) only if we are there at that turn.\n\nWe are given the car state at turn t1 (48). The cars move at constant speeds. For a car at freeway k:\n\n- If direction is right: the car moves to the right. The span at time T (>= t1) is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n  Note: the initial state for a right-moving car is given as (head, tail) = (h, tau) with h > tau? Actually, the table says for freeway 4: (head, tail) = (-16, -27) for the first car? But note the representation: for right-moving, the head is the front? But in the update rule for right-moving: \n      Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n  So if initially at t1, the car is [tau, h] (with tau < h) then at T, it becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. \n\n  However, in the table, the car is given as (h, tau, d, s). For example, freeway 4 has a car: (-16, -27, right, 4). \n  So head h = -16, tail tau = -27. Then the initial span at t1 is [tau, h] = [-27, -16]? But the update rule says for right: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\n  Similarly, left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] and the initial span is [h, tau]? Actually, the update rule says for left: the initial span is [h, tau] and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: in the car state table, all cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nFor a right-moving car: the head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the rear (leftmost). So the initial span at t1 is [tail, head] = [tau, h]. Then at T, [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nFor a left-moving car: the head is the front (leftmost) and tail is the rear (rightmost). The initial span at t1 is [head, tail] = [h, tau]. Then at T, [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut in our problem, all cars in the given state are right-moving? Let me check:\n\nFreeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 3) -> right-moving: initial span = [-35, -24] at t1=48.\n\nFreeway 2: same as 1.\nFreeway 3: same as 1.\nFreeway 4: three cars: \n   first: (-16, -27, right, 4) -> span [-27, -16] at t1=48.\n   second: (20, 9, right, 4) -> span [9,20] at t1=48? But wait: head=20, tail=9 -> so the car spans from 9 to 20? Then at T, the span becomes [9+4*(T-48), 20+4*(T-48)].\n   third: (56,45,right,4) -> [45,56] at t1=48.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars:\n   (48,37,right,12) -> [37,48] at t1=48.\n   (-24,-35,right,12) -> [-35,-24] at t1=48.\n\nSimilarly for freeways 6,7,8: same as freeway 5.\n\nWe need to avoid being on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T if at that turn T, the x-coordinate 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nSince the player starts at y=5 at t1=48, and we want to go to y=9, we must move upwards (U) at least 4 times. However, we might have to wait (S) or even move down (D) to avoid collisions.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H (number of turns) and the sequence of actions from t1 (turn 48) to turn t1+H-1 such that at the end we are at y=9.\n\nNote: the player is at (0,5) at turn 48. We are about to take an action at turn 48 that will determine y at turn 49.\n\nWe must avoid collisions at every turn from 48 until we leave the freeway system (i.e., until we are at y=9, which is the goal and not a freeway? Actually, the freeways are y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe).\n\nSo at the turn when we are at y=9, we don't check for collision? But note: the goal is to be at (0,9) at the last turn. At that turn, we are at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision check. Similarly, at y=0, we are safe.\n\nBut we start at y=5 (freeway) at turn 48. So we must check for collision at turn 48? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd note: at the initial turn (t1=48), we are at y=5. So we must check: at turn 48, is there a car on freeway 5 such that 0 is in its span?\n\nFor freeway 5 at turn 48, we have two cars:\n  car1: [37,48] -> 0 is not in [37,48] -> safe.\n  car2: [-35,-24] -> 0 is not in [-35,-24]? Actually, -35 to -24 is negative, so 0 is not in that interval -> safe.\n\nSo we are safe at turn 48.\n\nNow we plan the moves. We need to get to y=9. The minimal number of moves if there were no cars would be 4 (all U). But we must avoid collisions at each step.\n\nWe will simulate the moves and check for collisions at each turn for the freeway we are on.\n\nLet t0 = 48.\n\nWe denote the player's y at turn t (for t>=48) as y(t). We start at y(48)=5.\n\nAt each turn t (starting at 48), we choose an action a_t (U, D, or S) which determines y(t+1). But note: at turn t, we are at y(t). We must check that at turn t, we are not colliding with any car on freeway y(t).\n\nWe have to plan the actions for t=48, 49, 50, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe are to minimize H, the number of turns. So we want to reach as fast as possible.\n\nWe can try to go up as much as possible, but we must avoid the cars.\n\nWe note that the cars are moving at constant speeds. We need to compute for each freeway and each car, the span at a given turn T.\n\nWe are going to simulate turns starting from 48. We are going to check for each turn and each freeway we are on.\n\nWe are going to try to take U as much as possible, but if at some point we would be on a freeway that has a car at 0 at that turn, we must avoid (by waiting or moving down).\n\nHowever, moving down might be necessary to avoid a future collision? Or to let a car pass? But we want minimal H, so we prefer moving up.\n\nWe must check for each freeway we traverse:\n\n- When we are at freeway k at turn t, we must check all cars on freeway k at turn t.\n\nWe are going to step through turns.\n\nTurn 48: we are at y=5. We are safe at turn 48 (as checked above).\n\nNow, we choose an action at turn 48 that will lead to y(49). We want to go to 9, so we prefer U.\n\nBut we must consider: if we go up to 6 at turn 49, then at turn 49 we will be at y=6. We must check freeway 6 at turn 49.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay, then at turn 49 we are still at y=5.\n\nWe need to compute the car positions at each turn.\n\nLet's define the time offset: τ = T - 48, so at T=48, τ=0; at T=49, τ=1, etc.\n\nWe'll compute the spans for each car for τ >=0.\n\nWe'll list the freeways we care about: 1 to 8, but we start at 5 and go up to 9, so we will be on freeways 5,6,7,8 and then 9 (safe).\n\nWe don't need freeways 1-4 if we are going up from 5? Actually, we might move down? But we are going up so we won't go below 5. So we only care about freeways 5,6,7,8.\n\nBut note: if we move down, we might go to 4, then we need freeway 4. But we want to minimize time, so moving down would be counterproductive? Unless it avoids a long wait? However, we are going to try to avoid moving down if possible.\n\nWe'll plan a path that goes from 5 to 6 to 7 to 8 to 9.\n\nWe need to check for each step and at each freeway at the required turns.\n\nFirst, let's compute the car spans for freeways 5,6,7,8 for τ=0,1,2,... until we have enough turns.\n\nFreeway 5:\n  Car1: (48,37,right,12) -> at τ: [37 + 12*τ, 48 + 12*τ]\n  Car2: (-24,-35,right,12) -> [-35 + 12*τ, -24 + 12*τ]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5? \n  The table says for freeway 6: (48,37,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12) -> same as freeway 5.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 and 8 have the same two cars.\n\nBut note: freeway 4 has different cars, but we are starting at 5 and going up, so we don't need freeway 4 unless we move down.\n\nWe'll focus on freeways 5,6,7,8.\n\nSo for each freeway k (5,6,7,8), at a given τ, we have two cars:\n\nCar A: [37 + 12*τ, 48 + 12*τ]\nCar B: [-35 + 12*τ, -24 + 12*τ]\n\nWe must check if 0 is in either of these spans at a given τ for the freeway we are on.\n\nNow, we are going to simulate:\n\nWe are at:\n  t=48 (τ=0): y=5 -> safe (as above).\n\nAt t=48, we choose an action. Let's try U. Then at t=49, we will be at y=6.\n\nBut we must check at t=48: we are at y=5, and we are safe. Then at t=49, we are at y=6. We must check freeway 6 at t=49 (τ=1).\n\nAt freeway 6, τ=1:\n  CarA: [37+12*1, 48+12*1] = [49,60] -> 0 not in [49,60]\n  CarB: [-35+12*1, -24+12*1] = [-23,-12] -> 0 not in [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nSo we can move U at t=48 to go to y=6 at t=49.\n\nNow at t=49 (τ=1): we are at y=6. We choose an action. Let's try U to go to y=7 at t=50.\n\nWe must check at t=49: we are on freeway 6 at τ=1 -> safe (as above).\n\nThen at t=50 (τ=2), we would be at y=7. Check freeway 7 at τ=2.\n\nFreeway 7 at τ=2:\n  CarA: [37+12*2, 48+12*2] = [37+24,48+24] = [61,72] -> safe (0 not in)\n  CarB: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> wait, 0 is in [-11,0]? \n      The interval is [-11,0]. Since the car is right-moving and the span is [tail, head] = [-11,0] -> includes 0? \n      Yes, because 0 is between -11 and 0 (inclusive). So collision.\n\nTherefore, if we go from y=6 at t=49 to y=7 at t=50, then at t=50 we are at y=7 and we collide with carB on freeway7 at τ=2.\n\nSo we cannot do U at t=49.\n\nWhat are our options at t=49? We are at y=6. We can do S (stay) or D (down) or U (which we just saw leads to collision at the next turn).\n\nBut if we do S at t=49, then at t=50 we are still at y=6. Then we must check freeway 6 at t=50 (τ=2).\n\nFreeway 6 at τ=2:\n  CarA: [37+24,48+24]=[61,72] -> safe\n  CarB: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSo if we stay at y=6 at t=49, then at t=50 we are still at y=6 and we collide? Because at t=50, τ=2, freeway 6: CarB spans [-11,0] -> 0 is included.\n\nSo we cannot stay at y=6 at t=49 (because at t=50 we would be at y=6 and collide) and we cannot go up (because then at t=50 we are at y=7 and collide).\n\nWhat about going down? If we do D at t=49, then at t=50 we go to y=5.\n\nThen at t=50, we are at y=5. Check freeway 5 at τ=2.\n\nFreeway 5 at τ=2:\n  CarA: [37+24,48+24]=[61,72] -> safe\n  CarB: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSo at t=50, if we are at y=5, we collide? Then we cannot go down either.\n\nThis means that at t=49 (when we are at y=6) we have no safe action? That cannot be. We must have missed something.\n\nWait, we started at t=48: we did U to go to y=6 at t=49. But what if at t=48 we do not go up? Then we have other options.\n\nSo the problem is that going up at t=48 leads to a dead end at t=49. Therefore, we must consider an alternative at t=48.\n\nAt t=48 (τ=0): we are at y=5. We can do S or D or U.\n\nWe tried U and it led to a problem. What if we do S at t=48?\n\nThen at t=49, we are still at y=5. Then we must check at t=48 we did S: at t=48 we were at y=5 and safe. Then at t=49 (τ=1) we are at y=5. Check freeway5 at τ=1.\n\nFreeway5 at τ=1:\n  CarA: [37+12,48+12] = [49,60] -> safe\n  CarB: [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nSo safe. Then at t=49 we are at y=5. Now we choose an action.\n\nIf we do U at t=49: then at t=50 we are at y=6. Check freeway5 at t=49? We are at y=5 at t=49: safe (as above). Then at t=50 we are at y=6. Check freeway6 at τ=2 (since t=50 is τ=2).\n\nFreeway6 at τ=2: as above, CarB: [-11,0] -> 0 is in that interval -> collision.\n\nIf we do S at t=49: then at t=50 we are at y=5. Check freeway5 at τ=2: \n  CarA: [61,72] -> safe\n  CarB: [-11,0] -> collision (0 in [-11,0])\n\nIf we do D at t=49: then at t=50 we are at y=4. But y=4 is a freeway? Yes. Then we must check freeway5 at t=49? Actually, at t=49 we are at y=5: we already checked and it's safe. Then at t=50 we are at y=4. Check freeway4 at τ=2.\n\nWe have to compute freeway4 at τ=2.\n\nFreeway4 has three cars at t1 (τ=0):\n  Car1: (-16,-27,right,4) -> span at τ: [-27+4*τ, -16+4*τ]\n  Car2: (20,9,right,4) -> [9+4*τ, 20+4*τ]\n  Car3: (56,45,right,4) -> [45+4*τ, 56+4*τ]\n\nAt τ=2:\n  Car1: [-27+8, -16+8] = [-19,-8] -> 0 not in.\n  Car2: [9+8,20+8]=[17,28] -> safe.\n  Car3: [45+8,56+8]=[53,64] -> safe.\n\nSo at freeway4 at τ=2: safe.\n\nSo at t=49, we can do D to go to y=4 at t=50.\n\nBut we are now at y=4, and we want to go to y=9. This is going to take more moves. We need to go up 5 times: from 4 to 9.\n\nBut let's see if we can get out of this.\n\nHowever, we are trying to minimize H. We don't want to go down if we can avoid it.\n\nWe must reconsider: at t=48, we did U and got stuck at t=49. Then we tried S at t=48 and then at t=49 we are at y=5 and we have to do D to avoid collision at t=50? But that leads to y=4.\n\nIs there a way to avoid going down? We must look further.\n\nWhat if at t=48 we do D? Then at t=49 we are at y=4. Then we must check at t=48: we are at y=5 and safe. Then at t=49 we are at y=4. Check freeway4 at τ=1.\n\nFreeway4 at τ=1:\n  Car1: [-27+4, -16+4] = [-23,-12] -> safe\n  Car2: [9+4,20+4]=[13,24] -> safe\n  Car3: [45+4,56+4]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\nSo safe. Then at t=49 we are at y=4. We can try to go up at t=49 to y=5 at t=50.\n\nThen at t=50, we are at y=5. Check freeway5 at τ=2: \n  CarA: [37+24,48+24]=[61,72] -> safe\n  CarB: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> collision (0 in [-11,0])\n\nSo we collide at t=50.\n\nIf at t=49 (at y=4) we do S: then at t=50 we are at y=4. Check freeway4 at τ=2: as above, safe.\n\nThen at t=50 we are at y=4. Then we can try to go up to y=5 at t=51.\n\nBut at t=51, we will be at y=5. Check freeway5 at τ=3 (since t=51 is 48+3).\n\nFreeway5 at τ=3:\n  CarA: [37+36,48+36]=[73,84] -> safe\n  CarB: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nOh! So at τ=3, freeway5 is safe for both cars.\n\nSo we can do:\n\nt=48: D -> to y=4 at t=49\nt=49: S -> stay at y=4 at t=50\nt=50: U -> to y=5 at t=51\n\nThen at t=51 (τ=3) we are at y=5: safe.\n\nNow from y=5 at t=51, we want to go up.\n\nBut we remember that at τ=2, freeway6 was dangerous? But now we are at τ=3 for t=51.\n\nWe need to check the next steps.\n\nWe want to go to y=6 at t=52. So at t=51 we do U: then at t=52 we are at y=6. Check freeway6 at τ=4 (t=52 = 48+4).\n\nFreeway6 at τ=4:\n  CarA: [37+48,48+48]=[85,96] -> safe\n  CarB: [-35+48, -24+48]=[13,24] -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen at t=52, we are at y=6. We do U to go to y=7 at t=53. Check freeway7 at τ=5 (t=53 = 48+5).\n\nFreeway7 at τ=5:\n  CarA: [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe\n  CarB: [-35+60, -24+60]=[25,36] -> safe.\n\nThen at t=53, we are at y=7. Then U to y=8 at t=54. Check freeway8 at τ=6 (t=54=48+6).\n\nFreeway8 at τ=6:\n  CarA: [37+72,48+72]=[109,120] -> safe\n  CarB: [-35+72, -24+72]=[37,48] -> safe.\n\nThen at t=54, we are at y=8. Then U to y=9 at t=55. We are done at t=55 (y=9, safe).\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 48: D\nTurn 49: S\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\n\nBut wait: from y=5 at t=51, we did U at t=51 to go to y=6 at t=52. Then U at t=52 to y=7 at t=53, etc.\n\nTotal turns: from t=48 to t=55? That is 8 turns? But note: we start at turn 48 and we take 8 actions? Actually, we take actions at turns 48,49,50,51,52,53,54 (7 actions) and at turn 55 we are at y=9. So H=7? But we started at t=48 and we are done at t=55? The problem says: we take actions from t=48 to t48+H-1, and at turn t48+H-1 we are at (0,9). So if we start at t48=48, then the last action is at turn 48+H-1, and after that action we are at y=9.\n\nIn our sequence:\n\nAfter turn48 (action D): at t49 we are at y=4.\nAfter turn49 (S): at t50 we are at y=4.\nAfter turn50 (U): at t51 we are at y=5.\nAfter turn51 (U): at t52 we are at y=6.\nAfter turn52 (U): at t53 we are at y=7.\nAfter turn53 (U): at t54 we are at y=8.\nAfter turn54 (U): at t55 we are at y=9.\n\nSo the last action is at turn54 (which is 48+6) and we are at y=9 at the next turn (t55). But the problem says: we want to be at (0,9) at turn t48+H-1? \n\nWait: the sequence of actions is for t from t1 (48) to t1+H-1. And after the last action, the next state is y_{t1+H}. But we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nBut note: the player update: after action at turn t, we get y_{t+1}. So we require that at the turn when we take the last action, we are at (0,9) after the action? Actually, no.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd after the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we have y_{t1+H} = 9? \n\nBut the problem states: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". Let me read:\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nActually, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nSo at the turn when we take the last action (which is turn t1+H-1), we are at y=9 at that same turn? \n\nBut note: we take an action at turn t, and then the state y_{t+1} is updated. So we are at y_t at turn t, and after the action we go to y_{t+1}. \n\nThe problem requires that at the end of the sequence (i.e., at the last turn we act) we are at (0,9). But that would be at the turn we take the last action, so we are at y=9 at that turn? \n\nBut the collision rule: if we are at y=9 at turn T, then we don't check because it's not a freeway. But how do we get to be at y=9 at the turn we take the action? \n\nActually, the state at turn t is (0, y_t). We take action a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} for the next turn. \n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t. We take an action, and then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}. \n\nThe requirement is that at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9. \n\nThat means: at the last action (taken at turn t1+H-1), we start at y_{t1+H-1} and we choose an action that leads to y_{t1+H}. But we require that y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nBut if we are already at y=9 at turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to move? So we could just have arrived at an earlier turn? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nSo we must be at (0,9) at the turn t1+H-1. \n\nHow do we get there? \n\nWe can be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1 by either:\n   - Being there at the previous turn and staying? \n   - Or moving into it at that turn? \n\nBut note: if we are at y=8 at turn t1+H-2, then we can take U at turn t1+H-2 to go to y=9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\nThen at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9 and we don't need to take an action? But the sequence must have H actions, the last one at turn t1+H-1. \n\nBut if we are at y=9 at turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to move? So the last action would be at turn t1+H-1? But what action? We are already at 9, so we can do S (stay) or even U or D? But if we do U, we would go to 10 which is invalid? The rule: y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and do U, we stay at 9? Or it is clamped? The rule says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y, and y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and do U, we stay at 9? \n\nBut the problem does not specify clamping. However, the rule says: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\". So if we do U at 9, we get 10, but then we set it to 9? Or we are not allowed? The rule says: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\". So we must have y_{t+1} bounded. The problem doesn't specify, but typically in such games, you are not allowed to go beyond. So probably we are clamped. But to be safe, we should avoid going beyond.\n\nHowever, we can do S at the last turn to stay at 9.\n\nBut the requirement is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So if we arrive at turn t1+H-1 at y=9, then we are done. But we must have taken an action at that turn? \n\nThe sequence of actions is defined for t from t1 to t1+H-1. So we take H actions. And we require that at the turn when we take the last action (turn t1+H-1), we are at (0,9) at that turn? But how can we be at (0,9) at the same turn we take the action? The action is taken at the beginning of the turn? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"at turn T\", the player is at (0, y_T). Then we choose an action a_T. Then we update to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo at turn T, we are at y_T. We choose a_T, and then we update to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nThe requirement: at turn t1+H-1, we must be at (0,9). That means that we must have y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut how did we get to y_{t1+H-1}=9? By an action at the previous turn? \n\nSo we must have been at y_{t1+H-2} at turn t1+H-2, and then we take an action at turn t1+H-2 that sets y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nThen, at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9 and we don't take any action? But the sequence requires an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThe problem says: the sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1. So we take an action at turn t1+H-1. But if we are already at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we can take any action that leaves us at 9 (like S, or U if clamped to 9). \n\nBut note: the requirement is that we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So we must be at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action that might change it? But we don't care about the next state? Only that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nSo we are at (0,9) at the moment of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action? But after the action we might leave? \n\nBut the goal is to be there at that turn. So we must be at 9 at the start of the turn? And then we take an action? \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. But the problem states: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" and \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nSo we require that after taking the last action (which is at turn t1+H-1) we have the state at turn t1+H-1 is 9? \n\nBut the action at turn t1+H-1 will update the state to turn t1+H. \n\nI think there is a confusion. \n\nLooking back: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nSo at the turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nThe state at turn t is defined as (0, y_t). \n\nWe take an action at turn t to update to y_{t+1} for the next turn. \n\nTherefore, we are at y_t at turn t. \n\nSo to be at (0,9) at turn t, we must have y_t=9. \n\nSo the last action we take is at turn t1+H-1, and we require that at that turn, we are at y=9. \n\nBut how do we get to y=9 at turn t1+H-1? \n\nWe must have been at y_{t1+H-2} at turn t1+H-2, and then we took an action at turn t1+H-2 that set y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nThen, at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9, and we take an action? But the sequence includes an action at turn t1+H-1. \n\nBut if we are already at 9, we can do S (stay) to remain at 9 for the next state? But the goal only requires being at 9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\nSo we can do:\n\nAt turn t1+H-1: we are at 9, and we do S (or even U if clamped, but S is safe).\n\nBut we must have arrived at turn t1+H-1 at 9 by the previous action.\n\nIn our earlier plan, we arrived at y=9 at turn t55? But t55 is 48+7. So if H is 7, then the last action is at turn 48+6=54, and we are at y=9 at turn 55? That is turn t1+7. But we require to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 48+7-1 = 54? \n\nSo we are not at 9 at turn 54. We are at 8 at turn 54, and then we do U to go to 9 at turn 55. But then we are at 9 at turn 55, which is t1+7, so we would need H=8? \n\nLet me clarify:\n\nWe start at turn 48: y48=5.\n\nAfter action at turn 48: we get y49.\nAfter action at turn 49: we get y50.\n...\nAfter action at turn 54: we get y55.\n\nWe want y_{48+H-1}=9.\n\nIf we want to be at 9 at turn 54 (which is 48+6), then we need H-1=6 => H=7.\n\nSo we need to be at y54=9.\n\nIn our sequence:\n\nAt turn 48: we do D -> y49=4.\nAt turn 49: we do S -> y50=4.\nAt turn 50: we do U -> y51=5.\nAt turn 51: we do U -> y52=6.\nAt turn 52: we do U -> y53=7.\nAt turn 53: we do U -> y54=8.  -> not 9.\n\nWe need one more U: at turn 54: we do U -> y55=9. But then we are at 9 at turn 55, which is t1+7. So to have y54=9, we would have to be at 9 at turn 54.\n\nBut we were at 8 at turn 53. So we need to get to 9 by turn 54. How? We do U at turn 53 to go from 8 to 9 at turn 54.\n\nBut in our sequence, we did U at turn 53 and went to 8? That's not possible. We were at 7 at turn 53? Let me recount:\n\nt48: D -> y49=4\nt49: S -> y50=4\nt50: U -> y51=5\nt51: U -> y52=6\nt52: U -> y53=7\nt53: U -> y54=8\n\nSo at turn 54, we are at 8. To be at 9 at turn 54, we must have done an action at turn 53 that set y54=9? But we did U at turn 53 and set y54=8? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWe did U at turn 53: from y53=7, we did U -> y54=7+1=8.\n\nWe need to be at 9 at turn 54. So we must have been at 8 at turn 53 and then done U at turn 53 to go to 9 at turn 54.\n\nBut in our sequence, we are at 7 at turn 53, not 8.\n\nWe need to adjust: we must be at 8 at turn 53, then we can do U at turn 53 to be at 9 at turn 54.\n\nSo we need to get to 8 by turn 53.\n\nLet's see the timeline:\n\nWe are at:\nt48: y48=5 -> action D: y49=4\nt49: y49=4 -> action S: y50=4\nt50: y50=4 -> action U: y51=5\nt51: y51=5 -> action U: y52=6\nt52: y52=6 -> action U: y53=7\n\nThen at t53: we are at y53=7. We want to be at 8 at turn 54? But we want to be at 9 at turn 54? \n\nTo be at 9 at turn 54 (t1+H-1=48+6=54), we must have y54=9. So we must be at y53=8 and then do U at turn53 to get y54=9.\n\nBut we are at y53=7. So we need to get to 8 at turn53? That means we must do an action at turn52 to get y53=8.\n\nBut at turn52, we are at y52=6. If we do U, we go to 7 at turn53. Then we are at 7 at turn53, and then at turn53 we do U to go to 8 at turn54, and then at turn54 we do U to go to 9 at turn55. But then we are at 9 at turn55, which is 48+7, so H-1=7 => H=8.\n\nAlternatively, to be at 9 at turn54, we must have been at 8 at turn53 and then done U at turn53 to get to 9 at turn54.\n\nSo we need to get to 8 by turn53.\n\nHow can we do that? \n\nWe are at y52=6 at turn52. We need to go from 6 to 8 in one action? But we can only change by +1 per turn. So we cannot.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at 9 at turn54. The earliest we can be at 9 is turn55.\n\nSo we require H=8: the last turn we act is turn55? But we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 48+8-1=55.\n\nYes: if H=8, then we act at turns 48 to 55? But the last action is at turn 55? And we require that at turn 55, we are at 9.\n\nBut we are at turn55: we are at y55. To have y55=9, we must have done an action at turn54 that set y55=9.\n\nSo we are at y54=8 at turn54, then we do U at turn54 to set y55=9. Then at turn55, we are at 9, and we take an action? The sequence requires an action at turn55? But then we would be at y56= something. \n\nBut the goal is to be at 9 at turn55. So we can do S at turn55 to stay at 9? \n\nBut note: we must take an action at turn55? And then the next state is turn56, but we don't care.\n\nBut the problem only requires to reach (0,9) at turn55. \n\nSo the sequence would be:\n\nTurn48: D\nTurn49: S\nTurn50: U\nTurn51: U\nTurn52: U\nTurn53: U  -> at turn54: y54=8\nTurn54: U  -> at turn55: y55=9\nTurn55: S  -> to stay at 9 (or we could do U if clamped, but S is safe)\n\nBut is that minimal? H=8.\n\nBut we might find a faster way.\n\nIs there a way to get there in 7 turns? That is, be at 9 at turn54 (48+6).\n\nTo be at 9 at turn54, we must have been at 8 at turn53 and done U at turn53 to set y54=9.\n\nTo be at 8 at turn53, we must have been at 7 at turn52 and done U at turn52 to set y53=8.\n\nTo be at 7 at turn52, we must have been at 6 at turn51 and done U at turn51 to set y52=7.\n\nTo be at 6 at turn51, we must have been at 5 at turn50 and done U at turn50 to set y51=6.\n\nTo be at 5 at turn50, we must have been at 4,5, or6 at turn49 and done an action to get to 5 at turn50.\n\nBut we start at turn48 at y=5.\n\nSo we could do:\n\nt48: S -> stay at 5 at t49\nt49: ? \nBut we cannot stay at 5 at t49 and then do U to go to 6 at t50, because we have to avoid collisions.\n\nBut earlier at turn50 (τ=2) freeway5 is not safe: carB spans [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=5 at turn50.\n\nAlternatively, we could go down to 4 at turn49, then up to 5 at turn50? But at turn50, we are at y=5 -> collision.\n\nOr we could go down to 4 at turn48, then at turn49 go to 5? Then at turn50 we would be at 5 -> collision.\n\nOr at turn48: U to 6 at turn49, then we are at 6 at turn49. Then we need to get to 8 at turn53. So from 6 at turn49, we can do:\n\nt49: U -> to 7 at turn50 -> but at turn50, freeway7: τ=2 -> carB: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nt49: S -> to 6 at turn50 -> but at turn50, freeway6: τ=2 -> carB: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nt49: D -> to 5 at turn50 -> then at turn50, freeway5: τ=2 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at 6 at turn49 and avoid collision at turn50.\n\nTherefore, we cannot get to 9 by turn54. The minimal H is 8.\n\nBut we had a sequence for H=8:\n\nt48: D\nt49: S\nt50: U\nt51: U\nt52: U\nt53: U\nt54: U\nt55: S\n\nBut at turn55, we are already at 9? Why do we need to do an action at turn55? Because the sequence must have H=8 actions, from t48 to t55.\n\nAnd at turn55, we are at 9, and we do S to stay.\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence? We are taking 8 actions. But note: the initial state is at turn48, and we are at y5. We want to be at y9 at turn55 (which is 7 turns later?).\n\nThe turns are: 48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55 -> 8 turns? But we take 8 actions? However, the time from 48 to 55 is 8 states: y48, y49, ..., y55.\n\nBut the requirement is to be at turn t1+H-1 = 48+H-1 =55 => H-1=7 => H=8.\n\nSo we have to take 8 actions.\n\nBut we might find a sequence that gets to 9 earlier? \n\nFor example, if we can be at 9 at turn54, then we would have H=7 (since t1+H-1=48+6=54, so H=7). But we saw that is impossible.\n\nSo our sequence is:\n\nTurn48: D\nTurn49: S\nTurn50: U\nTurn51: U\nTurn52: U\nTurn53: U\nTurn54: U\nTurn55: S\n\nBut let's verify the collisions:\n\nt48: y48=5 -> safe (as before)\n   action: D -> y49=4\n\nt49: y49=4 -> check freeway4 at τ=1 (t49=48+1)\n   freeway4 at τ=1:\n        car1: [-27+4, -16+4] = [-23,-12] -> safe\n        car2: [9+4,20+4]=[13,24] -> safe\n        car3: [45+4,56+4]=[49,60] -> safe\n   action: S -> y50=4\n\nt50: y50=4 -> check freeway4 at τ=2 (t50=48+2)\n        car1: [-27+8, -16+8]=[-19,-8] -> safe\n        car2: [9+8,20+8]=[17,28] -> safe\n        car3: [45+8,56+8]=[53,64] -> safe\n   action: U -> y51=5\n\nt51: y51=5 -> check freeway5 at τ=3 (t51=48+3)\n        CarA: [37+36,48+36]=[73,84] -> safe\n        CarB: [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12] -> safe\n   action: U -> y52=6\n\nt52: y52=6 -> check freeway6 at τ=4 (t52=48+4)\n        CarA: [37+48,48+48]=[85,96] -> safe\n        CarB: [-35+48, -24+48]=[13,24] -> safe\n   action: U -> y53=7\n\nt53: y53=7 -> check freeway7 at τ=5 (t53=48+5)\n        CarA: [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe\n        CarB: [-35+60, -24+60]=[25,36] -> safe\n   action: U -> y54=8\n\nt54: y54=8 -> check freeway8 at τ=6 (t54=48+6)\n        CarA: [37+72,48+72]=[109,120] -> safe\n        CarB: [-35+72, -24+72]=[37,48] -> safe\n   action: U -> y55=9   (but wait, we planned to do S at t55? But at t54 we are at 8, and we do U to go to 9 at t55. Then at t55, we are at 9. Then we must do an action at t55: we do S to stay at 9.\n\nBut at t55, we are at y55=9. We don't need to check for collision because y=9 is safe. Then we do S: y56=9.\n\nBut the requirement is to be at 9 at turn55? Yes, we are. And we take an action at turn55 (S) to complete the sequence of 8 actions.\n\nAlternatively, we could do U at turn55? But then if not clamped, we would go to 10, which is invalid. But if clamped, we stay at 9. So either S or U (if clamped) is safe.\n\nBut the problem says: y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. So we cannot go to 10. We assume that if we try to go above 9, we stay at 9. So U at 9 is safe? But to be safe, we do S.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn48: D\nTurn49: S\nTurn50: U\nTurn51: U\nTurn52: U\nTurn53: U\nTurn54: U\nTurn55: S\n\nBut wait, at turn54 we did U: that sets y55=9. Then at turn55 we do S: that sets y56=9. But we are only required to be at 9 at turn55. So it's fine.\n\nBut can we avoid the last S? The sequence must have H=8 actions. So we must include an action at turn55.\n\nWe have to.\n\nBut is there a way to get to 9 earlier? We saw not. But we might find a sequence that doesn't go down.\n\nWe must try again to avoid the detour to 4.\n\nAt turn48, we are at y5. Instead of going down, can we wait at 5 until it's safe to move up?\n\nAt turn48: we are safe. If we do S at turn48: then at turn49, we are at y5. Check freeway5 at τ=1: safe (as before: [-23,-12] and [49,60]). Then at turn49, we do S again? Then at turn50, we are at y5. Check at τ=2: freeway5 has carB: [-11,0] -> collision. So we cannot stay at 5 for two turns.\n\nAt turn48: we do U to y6 at turn49. Then at turn49, we are at y6. We must avoid collision at turn50. But we saw that at turn50, freeway6 has carB: [-11,0] -> collision. So we cannot stay at y6 at turn49 (because then at turn50 we collide) and we cannot move to y7 (collide at turn50) or y5 (collide at turn50). \n\nBut what if we do nothing? We have to do something. So we must move to a safe freeway at turn50.\n\nThe only safe freeway at turn50 (τ=2) is which one?\n\nWe saw freeway4 is safe at τ=2. But we are at y6 at turn49. To go to y4 at turn50, we would have to do D twice? But we can only do one action per turn. \n\nAt turn49, we are at y6. We do D: then at turn50 we go to y5. But freeway5 at τ=2 is not safe. \n\nWe do D twice? But we can only do one action per turn. So at turn49, we do D: to y5 at turn50 -> collision.\n\nAlternatively, we do nothing at turn49: S -> stay at y6 at turn50 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot avoid going down to 4 at some point? \n\nBut we have freeway4 safe at τ=2. How can we get to freeway4 at turn50? We would need to be at y4 at turn50. At turn49, we are at y5 (if we did S at turn48) or at y6 (if we did U at turn48). \n\nFrom y5 at turn49: we do D to go to y4 at turn50 -> safe (freeway4 at τ=2 is safe).\n\nBut then at turn50, we are at y4. Then we can do U at turn50 to go to y5 at turn51. Then at turn51, freeway5 at τ=3 is safe. Then we can go up as before.\n\nThis sequence:\n\nt48: S -> y49=5\nt49: D -> y50=4\nt50: U -> y51=5\nt51: U -> y52=6\nt52: U -> y53=7\nt53: U -> y54=8\nt54: U -> y55=9\nt55: S\n\nThis also has 8 actions and we are at 9 at turn55.\n\nBut we save one move? No, we still have 8 actions.\n\nIn the previous sequence we did D at t48, then S at t49, then U at t50, etc. This one: S at t48, D at t49, then same as before from t50.\n\nBoth have 8 actions.\n\nBut which one is faster in terms of when we get to 9? In both we get to 9 at turn55. So same.\n\nBut in the first sequence (starting with D) we were at y4 at turn49 and turn50. In this one, we are at y5 at turn49 and y4 at turn50.\n\nBut we can compare the safety.\n\nIn this new sequence:\n\nt48: y48=5 -> safe (τ=0, freeway5: safe)\n   action S: y49=5\n\nt49: y49=5 -> check freeway5 at τ=1: safe (as before)\n   action D: y50=4\n\nt50: y50=4 -> freeway4 at τ=2: safe (as computed)\n   action U: y51=5\n\nt51: y51=5 -> freeway5 at τ=3: safe\n   action U: y52=6\n\nt52: y52=6 -> freeway6 at τ=4: safe\n   action U: y53=7\n\nt53: y53=7 -> freeway7 at τ=5: safe\n   action U: y54=8\n\nt54: y54=8 -> freeway8 at τ=6: safe\n   action U: y55=9\n\nt55: y55=9 -> safe (not a freeway), then we do S: y56=9.\n\nBut we require to be at 9 at turn55, which we are.\n\nThis sequence is also valid and has the same length.\n\nBut note: at turn55, we must take an action? So we do S.\n\nWe can choose either sequence. But we want minimal H, and both have H=8.\n\nIs there a sequence with H=7? We need to be at 9 at turn54 (48+6). \n\nWe must be at 9 at turn54. To get there, we must have been at 8 at turn53 and done U at turn53.\n\nTo be at 8 at turn53, we must have been at 7 at turn52 and done U at turn52.\n\nTo be at 7 at turn52, we must have been at 6 at turn51 and done U at turn51.\n\nTo be at 6 at turn51, we must have been at 5 at turn50 and done U at turn50.\n\nTo be at 5 at turn50, we must have been at 4,5,6 at turn49.\n\nBut we start at 5 at turn48.\n\nSo:\n\nOption1: \n  t48: S -> y49=5\n  t49: S -> but then y50=5, but at τ=2, freeway5 has collision -> not safe.\n\nOption2:\n  t48: U -> y49=6\n  t49: ? -> to get to 5 at turn50? But then at turn50 we are at 5 -> collision.\n\nOption3:\n  t48: D -> y49=4\n  t49: U -> y50=5 -> collision at turn50.\n\nSo we cannot be at 5 at turn50 without collision.\n\nTherefore, no sequence with H=7.\n\nSo minimal H=8.\n\nWe can choose either sequence. Let's pick the one that doesn't go down initially? \n\nThe second sequence: we stay at 5 at turn48, then go down at turn49 to 4, then up.\n\nBut we might also consider going up immediately and then down? But that didn't work.\n\nWe'll go with the second sequence:\n\nTurn48: S\nTurn49: D\nTurn50: U\nTurn51: U\nTurn52: U\nTurn53: U\nTurn54: U\nTurn55: S\n\nBut at turn55, we are at 9 and we do S.\n\nWe must write the answer.\n\nBut note: the initial position is (0,5) at turn48. We do action at turn48: S (stay). Then at turn49, we are at (0,5). Then we do D to go to (0,4) at turn50? \n\nWait: the update: at turn48: we do S, so y49 = y48 + 0 = 5.\nThen at turn49: we do D, so y50 = y49 - 1 = 4.\n\nThen at turn50: we do U, so y51=5.\n\nThen U at turn51: y52=6, etc.\n\nAnd we have verified the collisions.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway5 at τ=3 for turn51: \n  τ=3: t=48+3=51.\n  CarA: [37+12*3,48+12*3]=[37+36,48+36]=[73,84] -> safe\n  CarB: [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12] -> safe.\n\nAnd freeway6 at τ=4 (t52=48+4=52): \n  [37+48,48+48]=[85,96] and [-35+48,-24+48]=[13,24] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn48: S\nTurn49: D\nTurn50: U\nTurn51: U\nTurn52: U\nTurn53: U\nTurn54: U\nTurn55: S\n\nBut we have 8 actions, and we are at 9 at turn55.\n\nWe can write the answer.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nSo for t=0 to 7 (since H=8, t from 0 to 7):\n\nt=0: turn48: S\nt=1: turn49: D\nt=2: turn50: U\nt=3: turn51: U\nt=4: turn52: U\nt=5: turn53: U\nt=6: turn54: U\nt=7: turn55: S\n\nSo the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 48: S\nTurn 49: D\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: S\n}\n\nBut note: the initial turn is t1=48, and we list the actions for turns 48 to 55.\n\nWe could also have chosen the first sequence (starting with D at turn48). But this one also works.\n\nIs there a sequence that doesn't require going to 4? \n\nWe must avoid freeway5 and freeway6 at τ=2. We can only do that by being at a different freeway at turn50. The only safe freeway at τ=2 is freeway4. So we must be at y4 at turn50. \n\nTo get to y4 at turn50, we can either:\n  - Start at y5 at turn48: then we can go down at turn48 and turn49? But we can only do one action per turn. \n      t48: D -> y49=4\n      t49: S -> y50=4   (safe at τ=2 for freeway4)\n  or\n      t48: S -> y49=5\n      t49: D -> y50=4\n\nBoth require two moves to get to 4 at turn50. Then we need 5 moves to go from 4 to 9: 4->5->6->7->8->9: 5 moves. \nBut we have from turn50 to turn55: 6 actions (t50 to t55) which can cover 5 moves? But we have to take 6 actions: so we can do the 5 moves and then an extra S at the end.\n\nIn both cases, total 8 actions.\n\nSo no shorter sequence.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 48\\) is 8. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by moving down to \\(y = 4\\) to avoid dangerous car positions at \\(\\tau = 2\\) (turn 50) on freeways 5 and 6, then moving up to \\(y = 9\\).\n\n- At turn 48, staying at \\(y = 5\\) is safe (freeway 5 at \\(\\tau = 0\\): no car spans contain 0).\n- At turn 49, moving down to \\(y = 4\\) is safe (freeway 5 at \\(\\tau = 1\\): no car spans contain 0; freeway 4 at \\(\\tau = 1\\): no car spans contain 0).\n- At turn 50, moving up to \\(y = 5\\) is safe (freeway 4 at \\(\\tau = 2\\): no car spans contain 0).\n- At turn 51, moving up to \\(y = 6\\) is safe (freeway 5 at \\(\\tau = 3\\): no car spans contain 0).\n- At turn 52, moving up to \\(y = 7\\) is safe (freeway 6 at \\(\\tau = 4\\): no car spans contain 0).\n- At turn 53, moving up to \\(y = 8\\) is safe (freeway 7 at \\(\\tau = 5\\): no car spans contain 0).\n- At turn 54, moving up to \\(y = 9\\) is safe (freeway 8 at \\(\\tau = 6\\): no car spans contain 0; \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway).\n- At turn 55, staying at \\(y = 9\\) is safe (\\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway), and the position \\((0, 9)\\) is reached.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 48: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 49: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 50: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 51: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 52: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 53: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 54: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 55: \\text{ S}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 50, and the player is at (0,4). The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to y=8). The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) in the same row. Note that the grid has y from 0 to 9.\n\nImportant note about collisions: \n- Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (where y is between 1 and 8) and at that same turn T, there is a car on that freeway whose span includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n- When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, note that at turn T the player is still on row y_T and will only check for cars on row y_T. Then at turn T+1, the player is on row y_{T+1} and checks for cars on row y_{T+1}.\n\nWe are given the car state at turn t1 (which is 50). For each freeway (row) and each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed). The update for the car's span at a future turn T (T>t1) is:\n- For a right-moving car (direction right): at turn T, the car's span becomes [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)] (since initially at t1: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]).\n- For a left-moving car: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Actually, the direction is given as \"right\", so we only have right-moving cars.\n\nHowever, note the representation: for a right-moving car, the head is at the right end. So at time t1, the car is from [tail, head] and it moves to the right. But in the problem, the update for right-moving is: \n  Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the input, we see for freeway 4: \n  (-8, -19, right, 4), (28, 17, right, 4), (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nWait, note that in the representation, the head is the first number and tail the second? But the problem says for a right-moving car: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning that tau is the left end (tail) and h is the right end (head). However, in the input, we see a car represented as (head, tail, ...). \n\nLooking at the input: \n  For freeway 1: (-18, -29, right, 3) -> so head=-18, tail=-29? But then the span should be [tail, head] = [-29, -18]. But the problem says: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, ...)\" and then for right-moving: Span(t1)=[tau, h]. So we have to interpret the first number as h (head) and the second as tau (tail). Therefore, the span at t1 is [tau, h] = [-29, -18] for freeway 1.\n\nBut note: in the update, the car moves to the right. So at turn T, the span becomes: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nWe are to avoid being on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway that has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nPlan:\nWe need to go from y=4 to y=9. The minimal number of moves without any obstacles would be 5 moves (all U: up 5 times). But we have to avoid the freeways when there is a car at x=0 at the time we are on that row.\n\nWe are allowed to move down, but note that we start at 4 and the goal is 9 (so we must go up). Also, we can stay, but that would increase the number of turns.\n\nWe are to compute the minimal H and the sequence of actions.\n\nWe can simulate the future turns. We start at turn 50, position y=4. We consider the next turns (t=50,51,...) until we reach y=9.\n\nAt each turn, we choose an action (U, D, S). However, D might not be helpful because we want to go up. But sometimes we might have to wait (by staying or even moving down to avoid a collision) and then go up.\n\nBut note: we can only be on rows 0 to 9. If we are at row 0, we cannot go down. Similarly, at row 9, we have reached.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway row (1 to 8) at a turn T if at that turn T, there is a car on that row that covers x=0.\n\nSo for each freeway row (1 to 8) and for each car on that row, we can compute the times (turns) at which that car has 0 in its span. Then, when the player is on that row at that turn, it would be a collision.\n\nBut note: the player's movement: \n  At turn 50: we are at y=4. Then we choose an action that determines y at turn 51.\n\nWe are going to simulate the state (turn, y) and the actions.\n\nWe are to minimize H (the number of turns from t1=50 until we reach y=9). So we want to get to 9 as quickly as possible.\n\nLet me denote:\n  t0 = 50 (current turn)\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway row k (1 to 8) and each car on that row, the set of turns T (>=t0) for which the car's span includes 0.\n\nFor a right-moving car with initial head h, initial tail tau, speed s, at time t0, then at turn T (>=t0), the span is:\n  [tau + s*(T-t0), h + s*(T-t0)]\n\nWe need 0 to be in [tau + s*(T-t0), h + s*(T-t0)]. That is:\n  tau + s*(T-t0) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-t0)\n\nWe can solve for T:\n\n  T >= t0 + ceil( (-h) / s )? Actually, we have:\n\n  tau + s*(T-t0) <= 0  => T >= t0 + ceil( (-tau) / s )   [if s>0] but note tau is negative? Actually, tau and h are given as negative numbers? Let's see the input.\n\nIn the input, for freeway 1: tau=-29, h=-18 -> so the car is from -29 to -18 at t0=50. Then moving right at speed 3 per turn.\n\nThe condition for 0 to be in the span is:\n  -29 + 3*(T-50) <= 0 <= -18 + 3*(T-50)\n\nSo:\n  -29 + 3*(T-50) <= 0  => 3*(T-50) <= 29 => T-50 <= 29/3 ≈ 9.666 => T <= 50+9 = 59? Wait, no:\n\nActually, the condition is two inequalities:\n\n1. tau + s*(T-t0) <= 0  => T >= t0 + ceil( (-tau) / s )   [because we need the left end to be <=0]\n   But note: if (-tau) is positive? tau is negative, so -tau is positive.\n\n   Specifically: \n        tau + s*(T-t0) <= 0\n        => s*(T-t0) <= -tau\n        => T-t0 <= (-tau) / s   [since s>0]\n\n   But note: (-tau) is positive. So T-t0 <= ceil( (-tau) / s )? Actually, we don't need ceil because we are solving an inequality? Let me rearrange:\n\n        s*(T-t0) <= -tau\n        => T-t0 <= (-tau)/s\n\n   However, this is not correct because if we have an integer T, then we require T-t0 to be at least the smallest integer such that s*(T-t0) >= -tau? Actually, we have:\n\n        tau + s*(T-t0) <= 0   => s*(T-t0) <= -tau   (since tau is negative, -tau is positive)\n\n   For example: tau=-29, s=3: then 3*(T-50) <= 29 -> T-50 <= 29/3 ≈9.666 -> so T-50 <= 9 (if we require integer and the inequality must hold) -> T<=59? Actually, no: because 3*(59-50)=27<=29 -> holds. But also T=60: 3*10=30>29 -> fails. So T-50 must be in the range [ceil( (-tau - h? no) ].\n\nActually, we have two inequalities:\n\n   A: tau + s*(T-t0) <= 0   => T <= t0 + floor( (-tau) / s )   ??? Let me do:\n\n        s*(T-t0) <= -tau\n        => T-t0 <= (-tau) / s\n        Since T-t0 is integer, then T-t0 <= floor( (-tau)/s )? Actually, no: because if (-tau)/s is not integer, then the maximum integer T-t0 that satisfies is floor( (-tau)/s ). But note: we require s*(T-t0) <= -tau. So:\n\n        T-t0 must be <= floor( (-tau)/s )? Actually, no: because if (-tau)/s is 9.666, then T-t0=9: 9<=9.666 -> satisfies, but T-t0=10: 10>9.666 -> does not.\n\n        So T-t0 can be from 0 to floor( (-tau)/s )? Actually, no: because we are solving for T such that the inequality holds. So T-t0 must be <= floor( (-tau)/s )? \n\n        Actually: T-t0 <= floor( (-tau) / s )   because if we set k = T-t0, then k must satisfy k <= (-tau)/s. The largest integer k satisfying is floor( (-tau)/s ). So the condition is k <= floor( (-tau)/s ). But note: k can be any integer from 0 up to that.\n\n        However, we also have the other inequality:\n\n   B: 0 <= h + s*(T-t0)   => s*(T-t0) >= -h   [because h is negative?] \n\n        => T-t0 >= ceil( (-h) / s )   [because we need the smallest integer k such that s*k >= -h]\n\nSo the car covers 0 at turn T if and only if:\n\n        ceil( (-h) / s ) <= T-t0 <= floor( (-tau) / s )\n\nBut note: h and tau are negative, so -h and -tau are positive.\n\nLet me check with freeway 1: tau=-29, h=-18, s=3, t0=50.\n\n        (-h) = 18, so ceil(18/3)=ceil(6)=6.\n        (-tau)=29, floor(29/3)=floor(9.666)=9.\n\n        So T-t0 must be between 6 and 9 (inclusive). That is, turns 56 to 59.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2 and 3: same car? so same: turns 56-59.\n\nNow freeway 4 has three cars:\n\n  Car1: (-8, -19, right, 4) -> h=-8, tau=-19, s=4.\n      (-h)=8 -> ceil(8/4)=2\n      (-tau)=19 -> floor(19/4)=4 (because 19/4=4.75 -> floor=4)\n      So T-t0 in [2,4] -> turns 52,53,54.\n\n  Car2: (28, 17, right, 4) -> wait, note: head=28, tail=17? Then the span at t0 is [17,28]? Then moving right. \n        Condition: 17 + 4*(T-t0) <= 0 <= 28 + 4*(T-t0) ?\n\n        But 17 + 4*(T-t0) <=0 -> 4*(T-t0)<=-17 -> T-t0 <= -17/4 -> negative? so never? because T-t0>=0.\n\n        Actually, the head and tail are positive? Then the car is entirely to the right of 0 at t0 and moving further right. So 0 will never be in the span.\n\n        Similarly, car3: (-48,-59,right,4): \n             h=-48, tau=-59 -> so (-h)=48, ceil(48/4)=12; (-tau)=59, floor(59/4)=14 (since 59/4=14.75 -> floor=14). \n             So T-t0 in [12,14] -> turns 62,63,64.\n\nBut note: freeway 4 has three cars. The dangerous periods for freeway 4 are:\n  Car1: turns 52,53,54\n  Car2: never\n  Car3: turns 62,63,64\n\nSo freeway 4 is dangerous at turns 52,53,54 and 62,63,64.\n\nNow freeway 5,6,7,8: each has two cars.\n\n  First car: (-48,-59,right,12): \n        h=-48, tau=-59, s=12.\n        (-h)=48 -> ceil(48/12)=4\n        (-tau)=59 -> floor(59/12)=4 (since 59/12=4.916 -> floor=4)\n        So T-t0 must be 4 -> turn 54.\n\n  Second car: (0,-11,right,12): \n        h=0, tau=-11, s=12.\n        Condition: \n          tau + s*(T-t0) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-t0)\n          => -11 + 12*(T-t0) <= 0 and 0 <= 0 + 12*(T-t0)\n          The second condition: 0<=12*(T-t0) -> always true for T>=t0.\n          First condition: -11 + 12*(T-t0) <=0 -> 12*(T-t0)<=11 -> T-t0 <= 11/12 -> so T-t0=0? \n          At T=t0: -11+0=-11<=0 -> true. So only at T=t0=50.\n\n        But note: at T=t0, we are at turn 50. The player is at y=4 (freeway 4 is row4, but we are on row4 at turn50? and this car is on row5? so we are not on row5 at turn50, so no collision?).\n\n        However, for freeway 5: the car at (0,-11,right,12) is on row5. So if the player is on row5 at turn50, then collision? but the player is at row4 at turn50.\n\n        So for the second car on freeway5: dangerous at turn50 only? but then for future turns: T>t0: \n          -11 + 12*(T-t0) <=0 -> T-t0 <= 11/12 -> so no integer T-t0>=1 satisfies. So only at turn50.\n\n        Therefore, freeway5 is dangerous at:\n          first car: turn54\n          second car: turn50\n\n        But note: at turn50, the player is on row4, so if we go to row5 at turn51, then at turn51 we check row5? and the car on row5 at turn51: \n          For the second car: at turn51 (T=t0+1): \n             span = [-11+12*1, 0+12*1] = [1,12] -> does not include 0? \n          So only at turn50 the second car covers 0? and we are not on row5 at turn50.\n\n        Therefore, freeway5 is dangerous at turn54 (from the first car) and the second car is not dangerous for future turns (only turn50, which we skip).\n\nSimilarly, freeway6,7,8: same two cars? so same: dangerous at turn54 (from the first car) and the second car only at turn50 (which we avoid).\n\nBut note: the first car on freeway5,6,7,8: \n        h=-48, tau=-59, s=12: only turn54 is dangerous.\n\nSo to summarize the dangerous turns for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: turns 56,57,58,59\nFreeway 2: same as 1: 56-59\nFreeway 3: same: 56-59\nFreeway 4: turns 52,53,54 (from car1) and 62,63,64 (from car3)\nFreeway 5: turn54 (from first car) and turn50 (from second car, but we are at row4 at turn50 so not affected) -> so only turn54\nFreeway 6: same as 5: turn54\nFreeway 7: same: turn54\nFreeway 8: same: turn54\n\nNow, we are at turn50, y=4.\n\nWe want to go up: \n  We must traverse rows 4,5,6,7,8,9. But note: we start at row4 at turn50. Then at turn51 we can be at row4 (if S), row5 (if U), or row3 (if D) [but row3 is not freeway? actually freeways are 1-8, but row3 is freeway? yes, row3 is freeway3? and we have to avoid collisions on row3 as well? yes, because freeways are rows 1 to 8.\n\nBut note: row0 and row9 are safe (no cars).\n\nOur goal: reach row9.\n\nWe are going to simulate the moves. We want the minimal H. The minimal without obstacles is 5: \n  50: start at 4\n  51: 5\n  52: 6\n  53: 7\n  54: 8\n  55: 9 -> then at turn55 we are at 9 -> H=5? But note: we start at turn50 and we do actions at turn50,51,52,53,54 (5 actions) and then at turn55 we are at 9? Actually, we start at turn50 and we are at (0,4). Then we do actions at turn50,51,...,54 (for H=5, we do 5 actions) and then at turn55 we have the position after the last action? So we require that at turn55 we are at 9.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning that we take H actions, starting at t1 (50) and ending at t1+H-1 (50+H-1). Then the position at turn t1+H is the one we are at. And we require that position to be (0,9). So:\n\n  After H actions, we are at turn 50+H, and we require y_{50+H}=9.\n\nIn the minimal case: \n  We start at turn50: y50=4.\n  Then we do U at turn50: then y51=5.\n  U at 51: y52=6.\n  U at 52: y53=7.\n  U at 53: y54=8.\n  U at 54: y55=9.\n\nSo H=5: we do 5 actions (at turns50 to54) and at turn55 we are at 9.\n\nBut we must check that we avoid collisions at every turn from 50 to 54 (inclusive) for the row we are on at that turn.\n\nAt each turn T (50,51,52,53,54), we are on row y_T. We must not be on a freeway row that is dangerous at that turn.\n\nCheck:\n\nTurn50: y=4 -> freeway4. Dangerous at freeway4: turns52,53,54 -> so turn50 is safe? \n        But freeway4 is dangerous at 52,53,54 and 62,63,64. So turn50 is safe.\n\nTurn51: we plan to be at y=5. Then we check freeway5: dangerous at turn54? and also at turn50 (but turn50 is over). So at turn51: is freeway5 dangerous? \n        We have the dangerous turns for freeway5: only turn54. So at turn51: safe.\n\nTurn52: y=6 -> freeway6: dangerous at turn54? and at turn50? so at turn52: safe? because dangerous only at turn54.\n\nTurn53: y=7 -> freeway7: dangerous at turn54? and turn50? so at turn53: safe.\n\nTurn54: y=8 -> freeway8: dangerous at turn54? -> YES! So at turn54, if we are on row8, we collide.\n\nTherefore, the naive plan (all U) fails at turn54: we are at row8 at turn54 and row8 is dangerous at turn54.\n\nSo we must avoid being on row8 at turn54.\n\nWe can try to delay the move to row8 until after turn54? or go faster? but we are already going as fast as possible? \n\nAlternatively, we can try to skip a move? For example, at one of the turns we stay (S) or even move down to avoid the collision at turn54.\n\nWe need to avoid row8 at turn54. So we must not be on row8 at turn54.\n\nPossible adjustments:\n\nOption 1: At turn53, instead of moving to row8, we stay at row7 (so at turn53 we do S) and then at turn54 we move to row8? But then at turn54 we are at row8 -> collision.\n\nOption 2: At turn53, we don't go to row7? but then we are behind.\n\nAlternatively, we can go slower: \n  At turn50: U -> to 5\n  turn51: U -> to 6\n  turn52: U -> to 7\n  turn53: S -> stay at 7 (so at turn54 we are still at 7) -> then at turn54 we are on row7: which is dangerous? freeway7 is dangerous at turn54? yes! because freeway7 has the same cars as freeway5: dangerous at turn54. So at turn54 we are at row7: collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down at turn53: to row6? then at turn54 we are at row6: freeway6 is dangerous at turn54 -> collision.\n\nSo we must avoid being on any freeway from 5 to 8 at turn54? because freeways 5,6,7,8 are all dangerous at turn54.\n\nTherefore, we must be at row0, row9, or row1,2,3,4 at turn54? But row1,2,3,4: \n  row4: freeway4 is dangerous at turn54? yes! because freeway4 has car1 that is dangerous at 52,53,54 -> so turn54 is dangerous for row4.\n  row3: freeway3: dangerous at turns56-59 -> so turn54 is safe for row3.\n  row2: safe at turn54? freeway2: dangerous at 56-59 -> safe.\n  row1: safe.\n\nSo at turn54, we can be at row1,2,3, or row0, or row9.\n\nBut we are going from 4 to 9. We cannot be at row0? because we are going up.\n\nWe are at row4 at turn50. We need to get to row9. We must pass through row5,6,7,8.\n\nBut at turn54, we must not be on rows4,5,6,7,8 (because row4 is dangerous at turn54, and rows5-8 are dangerous at turn54). So we must be at row3 or below? or row9? \n\nBut row9 is the goal. How can we be at row9 at turn54? That would require 5 moves: 4->5->6->7->8->9: that takes 5 moves: from turn50 to turn54 (4 moves: U at 50,51,52,53 -> then at turn54 we do U to get to 9 at turn55? no, at turn54 we do the fifth U and then at turn55 we are at 9. So we cannot be at row9 at turn54.\n\nAlternatively, if we do 4 moves in 4 turns? that's the same: at turn54 we are at row8.\n\nSo we must be at row3 at turn54? \n\nHow? \n  We start at 4 at turn50.\n  We can do: \n      turn50: D -> to 3 (so we go down to 3 at turn51? no: at turn50 we do D: then at turn51 we are at 3? \n\nBut then we are at row3 at turn51. Then we can go up from there.\n\nBut note: we must avoid collisions at every turn.\n\nAt turn50: we start at row4 (safe) and we choose D: then at turn51 we are at row3. \n  Turn51: row3: dangerous? freeway3: dangerous at turns56-59 -> so safe.\n\nThen at turn51: we can do U -> to 4 at turn52? \n  Turn52: row4: freeway4 is dangerous at 52,53,54 -> so turn52: dangerous? so we cannot be at row4 at turn52.\n\nSo we must avoid row4 at turn52.\n\nAlternatively, at turn51 we stay at 3? then at turn52 we are at 3. Then at turn52: row3 is safe? yes.\n\nThen at turn52: we do U -> to 4 at turn53? but row4 at turn53: dangerous? freeway4: dangerous at 52,53,54 -> so turn53: dangerous.\n\nSo we cannot be at row4 at turn52 or turn53? because both are dangerous.\n\nBut we must go through row4 to get to row5? \n\nAlternatively, we can go from row3 to row5? by doing two Ups? But the move is only one per turn: we can only change by 1 per turn. So we cannot jump.\n\nSo we must traverse row4 at some turn. The dangerous turns for row4 are 52,53,54. So we must be at row4 at a turn that is not 52,53,54. The next safe turn for row4 is after 54? the next dangerous period is 62-64, but that is too late.\n\nBut we have to get to 9 as quickly as possible.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid row4 entirely? but we start at row4 at turn50. Then we leave at turn50: either to row3 or row5. \n\nWe tried row3. Then we are stuck because we cannot get back to row4 without hitting a dangerous turn? \n\nWhat if we go up at turn50? to row5? \n  Then at turn51: we are at row5. \n  Turn51: row5: dangerous? freeway5: dangerous at turn54 and turn50 -> so turn51 is safe.\n\nThen at turn51: we go up to row6 at turn52 -> safe? freeway6: dangerous only at turn54 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn52: we go up to row7 at turn53 -> safe? freeway7: dangerous at turn54 -> safe at turn53.\n\nThen at turn53: we are at row7. Now we cannot go up to row8 at turn54 because row8 is dangerous at turn54. And we cannot stay at row7 at turn54 because row7 is dangerous at turn54. \n\nSo what can we do at turn53? \n  We can go down to row6? then at turn54 we are at row6: which is dangerous? because freeway6 is dangerous at turn54 -> collision.\n\n  Or we can go down to row8? no, we can only change by 1. \n\nAlternatively, we can wait at some row? \n\nWe must avoid being on rows4,5,6,7,8 at turn54. So we must get to row9 by turn54? impossible because that would require 5 moves and we only have 4 moves (from turn50 to turn53: 4 moves) and then at turn54 we would be at row8 (if we did 4 moves: 4->5->6->7->8) and then at turn54 we do a fifth move to go to 9 at turn55. But then at turn54 we are at row8 -> collision.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  turn50: U -> to5 (safe)\n  turn51: U -> to6 (safe)\n  turn52: U -> to7 (safe)\n  turn53: D -> to6 (then at turn54 we are at row6: which is dangerous? because freeway6 at turn54: collision)\n\n  turn53: S -> to7 (then at turn54 we are at row7: dangerous -> collision)\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nWhat if we go slower? \n\n  turn50: S -> stay at4 (safe at turn50: row4 safe at turn50)\n  turn51: U -> to5 (safe at turn51: row5 safe at turn51)\n  turn52: U -> to6 (safe at turn52: row6 safe at turn52)\n  turn53: U -> to7 (safe at turn53: row7 safe at turn53)\n  turn54: we want to go to8? but row8 at turn54: collision.\n\n  Or at turn54: we stay at7 -> then at turn54 we are at row7: collision.\n\nSo we must not be at row7 at turn54? \n\nHow about we go to row8 after turn54? \n\nBut then we need to wait until turn55 to be at row8? \n\nBut then we can:\n\n  turn50: U (to5) \n  turn51: U (to6)\n  turn52: U (to7)\n  turn53: S (stay at7) -> then at turn54 we are at row7: collision? because row7 is dangerous at turn54.\n\n  turn53: D (to6) -> then at turn54 at row6: collision.\n\nSo we must avoid rows4-8 at turn54. The only safe rows at turn54 are 0,1,2,3,9. We cannot be at 9 by turn54. So we must be at 0,1,2, or3.\n\nBut we start at4 and we are going up. So we have to go down to 3,2,1,0.\n\nLet me try:\n\n  turn50: D (to3) -> safe at turn50: we are at row4? no: we do D at turn50: then at turn51 we are at3? But at turn50 we start at4 and do D: then at turn50 we are still at4? and then the update: at turn51 we are at3.\n\n  Actually, the player update: \n      y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and the action a_t determines Δy_t at time t.\n\n  So at turn50: we start at y50=4. Then we choose a50=D -> then y51=4-1=3.\n\n  At turn50: we are at row4 -> which is safe at turn50.\n\n  Then at turn51: we are at row3 -> safe (freeway3 dangerous at 56-59, so safe at51).\n\n  Then at turn51: we can choose to go down to2 or stay or up to4? \n      If we go up to4 at turn52: then at turn52 we are at4 -> which is dangerous (freeway4 dangerous at52) -> collision.\n\n      So we avoid row4 at turn52. \n\n      We can stay at3 at turn51: then at turn52 we are at3 -> safe.\n\n      Then at turn52: we are at3. Then we can go down to2? or stay? or up to4? but row4 is dangerous at52, so we avoid.\n\n      turn52: D -> to2 at turn53: safe? freeway2: dangerous at56-59 -> safe at53? actually at turn53 we are at row2.\n\n      Then at turn53: we can choose: \n          U: to3 at turn54? safe at row3 at turn54? yes.\n          D: to1 at turn54: safe (row1: safe at turn54).\n          S: stay at2: safe.\n\n      Then at turn54: we are at row1,2, or3 -> safe.\n\n      Then after turn54, we can go up.\n\nBut how long will it take? \n\n  We are at turn50: 4\n  turn51: 3\n  turn52: 3 (if we did S at51) or 2 (if we did D at51)\n  turn53: then we can be at 2,3, or1.\n\n  Then at turn54: we are safe at one of these.\n\n  Then we need to go up to9: \n      From row2: we need 7 moves? 2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9: 7 moves? \n      From row3: 6 moves.\n\n  So total turns: \n      We have used 4 turns (50,51,52,53) and then at turn54 we start at (say) row3. Then we need 6 moves: turns54,55,56,57,58,59 -> so at turn60 we reach 9. Total H=10? (from turn50 to59: 10 actions) -> then at turn60 we are at9.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nAlternatively, we might go up as much as possible before turn54 and then go down to a safe row at turn54.\n\nFor example:\n\n  turn50: U to5 (safe)\n  turn51: U to6 (safe)\n  turn52: U to7 (safe)\n  turn53: D to6 (then at turn54 we are at6? -> but row6 at turn54: dangerous -> collision) -> fails.\n\n  turn50: U to5\n  turn51: U to6\n  turn52: S at6 (then at turn53:6)\n  turn53: D to5 (then at turn54:5) -> row5 at turn54: dangerous.\n\n  turn50: U to5\n  turn51: U to6\n  turn52: D to5 (then at turn53:5)\n  turn53: D to4 (then at turn54:4) -> row4 at turn54: dangerous.\n\n  turn50: U to5\n  turn51: S at5\n  turn52: U to6\n  turn53: U to7 -> then at turn54: we are at7: dangerous.\n\nNone work.\n\nBut note: we can also consider that after turn54, the only danger is freeway4 at turns62-64 and freeways1-3 at turns56-59. \n\nWe can be at row8 at turn55? \n\nHow:\n\n  We need to avoid being on row8 at turn54. But we can be at row8 at turn55? \n\n  How to get to row8 at turn55? \n      We must be at row7 at turn54, and then at turn54 we do U to go to8 at turn55.\n\n  But at turn54, we are at row7: which is dangerous? freeway7 at turn54: collision.\n\n  So we cannot be at row7 at turn54.\n\n  Similarly, we cannot be at row6,5,4 at turn54.\n\nTherefore, the only safe rows at turn54 are 0,1,2,3.\n\nSo we must be at one of these at turn54.\n\nThen after turn54, we can start moving up.\n\nLet me try a plan:\n\n  We want to minimize the total turns.\n\n  We have 4 turns (50,51,52,53) to go from 4 to a safe row at turn54 (which must be <=3). We also want to be as high as possible at turn54 to minimize the remaining moves.\n\n  The highest safe row at turn54 is 3.\n\n  How to get to row3 at turn54?\n\n  We start at4 at turn50.\n\n  We need to go down by at least 1. \n\n  Possibilities:\n\n      Option A: \n          turn50: D -> to3 at turn51\n          turn51: S -> to3 at turn52\n          turn52: S -> to3 at turn53\n          turn53: S -> to3 at turn54   -> then at turn54: row3 (safe)\n\n      Then from turn54: we are at3. We need to go to9: 6 moves: \n          turn54: U->4\n          turn55: U->5\n          turn56: U->6\n          turn57: U->7\n          turn58: U->8\n          turn59: U->9   -> then at turn60: we are at9.\n\n      Total actions: from turn50 to59: 10 actions.\n\n      But is it safe?\n\n        turn50: row4: safe (as established)\n        turn51: row3: safe\n        turn52: row3: safe\n        turn53: row3: safe\n        turn54: row3: safe\n\n        turn55: row4: we need to check freeway4 at turn55: \n            freeway4: dangerous at52,53,54 and 62,63,64 -> turn55 is safe.\n        turn56: row5: freeway5: dangerous at54 and 50 -> turn56: safe? \n            But wait, freeway5: we only computed turn54? \n            Actually, for freeway5, the first car: (-48,-59,12) -> dangerous only at turn54? \n            The second car: dangerous only at turn50.\n            So turn56: safe.\n\n        turn57: row6: freeway6: dangerous only at turn54 -> safe.\n        turn58: row7: freeway7: dangerous only at turn54 -> safe.\n        turn59: row8: freeway8: dangerous only at turn54 -> safe.\n\n        So safe.\n\n      But can we do better? \n\n  Option B: get to row3 at turn54 but with fewer moves? \n\n      We start at4. We only need to go down once. But we have to avoid row4 at the dangerous turns (52,53,54). \n\n      We can do:\n          turn50: D -> to3 (at turn51)\n          turn51: S or U? \n          But if we do U at turn51: then at turn52: we are at4 -> dangerous (freeway4 dangerous at52) -> collision.\n\n      So we must not be at4 at52,53,54. \n\n      Therefore, we must stay at3 or below until turn55? \n\n      So we can only leave row3 at turn55? \n\n      Then the earliest we can be at4 is turn55.\n\n      Then:\n          turn50: D -> to3 (at51)\n          turn51: S -> to3 (at52)\n          turn52: S -> to3 (at53)\n          turn53: S -> to3 (at54)   [safe at54]\n          turn54: U -> to4 (at55)   [safe: row4 at turn55: not dangerous (dangerous only at52,53,54,62-64)]\n          turn55: U -> to5 (at56)\n          turn56: U -> to6 (at57)\n          turn57: U -> to7 (at58)\n          turn58: U -> to8 (at59)\n          turn59: U -> to9 (at60)   -> 10 actions.\n\n      Same as before.\n\n  Can we get to a lower row faster? \n\n  How about row2 at turn54? \n      Then we start at4.\n      turn50: D -> to3 (at51)\n      turn51: D -> to2 (at52)\n      turn52: D -> to1 (at53) -> then at53: row1: safe? freeway1: dangerous at56-59 -> safe.\n      turn53: S or U? \n          If U: to2 at54 -> safe at54? row2: freeway2: dangerous at56-59 -> safe.\n          Then from turn54: row2: need 7 moves: 2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9: 7 moves: turns54 to60: then at turn61:9 -> total 11 actions.\n\n      That's worse.\n\n  Or at turn53: S -> to1 at54: safe. Then at turn54: row1: then 8 moves to9: 1->2->...->9: 8 moves -> total actions: 4 (from50 to53) + 8 = 12 -> worse.\n\n  Or we go up from row2 at turn53: \n      turn53: U -> to3 at54: safe.\n      Then at54: row3: then 6 moves to9: 3->4->...->9: 6 moves -> total 4+6=10 moves.\n\n  Same as before.\n\nBut wait, can we be at row0? \n  We start at4, then D 4 times: \n      turn50: D->3\n      turn51: D->2\n      turn52: D->1\n      turn53: D->0   (at turn54: row0 -> safe, because row0 is not a freeway)\n      Then at turn54:0 -> then we need 9 moves: 0->1->...->9: 9 moves -> total 4+9=13 -> worse.\n\nSo the best we have is 10 actions.\n\nBut is there a way to do better than 10?\n\nWhat if we go up initially and then down to row3 at turn54? \n\n  turn50: U->5 (safe)\n  turn51: U->6 (safe)\n  turn52: U->7 (safe)\n  turn53: D->6 (then at turn54: we are at6? -> dangerous, because freeway6 at turn54: collision) -> fails.\n\n  turn50: U->5\n  turn51: U->6\n  turn52: D->5 (then at turn53:5)\n  turn53: D->4 (then at turn54:4 -> dangerous) -> fails.\n\n  turn50: U->5\n  turn51: S->5\n  turn52: D->4 (then at turn53:4)\n  turn53: D->3 (then at turn54:3 -> safe)\n\n  Then from turn54:3, we go up: \n        turn54: U->4\n        turn55: U->5\n        turn56: U->6\n        turn57: U->7\n        turn58: U->8\n        turn59: U->9 -> at turn60:9.\n\n  Total actions: from turn50 to59: 10 actions.\n\n  Check safety:\n\n      turn50: row4: safe -> then action U: at turn51 we are at5 -> safe (freeway5: dangerous at54,50 -> turn51 safe)\n      turn51: row5: safe -> action U: to6 at52 -> safe (freeway6: dangerous only at54 -> turn52 safe)\n      turn52: row6: safe -> action D: to5 at53 -> at turn53: row5: safe (freeway5: dangerous at54, not at53)\n      turn53: row5: safe -> action D: to4 at54 -> at turn54: row4: dangerous! because freeway4 is dangerous at54.\n\n  Oh, so turn54: row4 is dangerous.\n\n  So we must avoid row4 at turn54.\n\n  In this plan, we are at row4 at turn54: collision.\n\n  How about we go down to row2 at turn53? \n      turn50: U->5\n      turn51: U->6\n      turn52: D->5\n      turn53: D->4 -> then at turn54:4 -> collision.\n\n  Or turn53: D->4? then collision.\n\n  How about turn52: D->5, then turn53: D->4 -> collision.\n\n  How about turn52: D->5, turn53: D->4 is the same.\n\nAlternatively, from row6 at turn52, we do two downs:\n\n      turn52: D->5\n      turn53: D->4 -> then at54:4 -> collision.\n\n  Or turn53: D->4 is unavoidable if we want to get to a safe row below? but row4 is not safe at54.\n\n  So we must get to row3 or below at turn54, and we cannot pass through row4 at turn54? \n\n  How about:\n\n      turn50: U->5\n      turn51: U->6\n      turn52: D->5\n      turn53: D->4 -> then at54:4 (dangerous) -> fail.\n\n      turn50: U->5\n      turn51: U->6\n      turn52: D->5\n      turn53: D->4 -> same.\n\n  We cannot get to row3 in one move from row5? \n\n  So from row6 at turn52, we can only go to row5 at turn53, and then row4 at turn54 (which is dangerous).\n\n  Therefore, the only safe way is to go down early to row3 and then wait until turn54.\n\n  And that takes 10 actions.\n\nBut wait, is there a way to be at row3 at turn54 without spending 4 actions? \n\n  We start at4 at50. We do:\n      turn50: D -> to3 at51  (1 action)\n      then we wait at3 for three turns: actions at51,52,53: S,S,S -> so we are at3 at54.\n\n  Total actions: 4 (turns50,51,52,53) and then we start moving up at54.\n\n  We need 6 more actions to go from3 to9: \n        turn54: U->4\n        turn55: U->5\n        turn56: U->6\n        turn57: U->7\n        turn58: U->8\n        turn59: U->9\n\n  So actions at turns50 to59: 10 actions.\n\n  And we are at9 at turn60.\n\n  Is there a way to be at row3 earlier? no, because we cannot skip turns.\n\n  Or can we be at row3 at turn53 and then move to row4 at turn54? \n      But then at turn54 we are at4: which is dangerous.\n\n  So we must not be at4 at54.\n\n  Therefore, we have to wait at3 until after turn54.\n\n  So the earliest we can leave row3 is turn54 (action at54: U to4 at55).\n\n  So the plan is fixed.\n\n  But note: at turn54, when we are at row3, we do U to go to4 at turn55. \n      At turn55: row4: safe? freeway4: dangerous at52,53,54 -> turn55 is safe.\n\n  Then we go up.\n\n  However, there is another danger: freeway4 is also dangerous at turns62,63,64. \n      We are at row4 at turn55: safe.\n      Then we go to row5 at turn56: safe.\n      row6 at57: safe.\n      row7 at58: safe.\n      row8 at59: safe.\n      row9 at60: safe.\n\n  But what about freeway1,2,3 at turns56-59? \n      We are at row5 at56: safe (freeway5: dangerous only at54 -> safe)\n      row6 at57: safe\n      row7 at58: safe\n      row8 at59: safe.\n\n  And freeway1,2,3 are dangerous at56-59, but we are not on freeway1,2,3 at those turns? \n      We are on row5 at56, row6 at57, row7 at58, row8 at59: these are freeways5,6,7,8 -> not freeway1,2,3.\n\n  So safe.\n\n  Therefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\n  The sequence:\n\n      turn50: D\n      turn51: S\n      turn52: S\n      turn53: S\n      turn54: U\n      turn55: U\n      turn56: U\n      turn57: U\n      turn58: U\n      turn59: U\n\n  But wait, we start at4. We do D at50: then at51 we are at3.\n  Then S at51: at52 we are at3.\n  Then S at52: at53 we are at3.\n  Then S at53: at54 we are at3.\n  Then U at54: at55 we are at4.\n  Then U at55: at56 we are at5.\n  Then U at56: at57 we are at6.\n  Then U at57: at58 we are at7.\n  Then U at58: at59 we are at8.\n  Then U at59: at60 we are at9.\n\n  And we stop after 10 actions (turns50 to59) and at turn60 we are at9.\n\n  But the problem: we are to provide the sequence for the actions at turns50,51,...,59.\n\n  So:\n\n      Turn 50: D\n      Turn 51: S\n      Turn 52: S\n      Turn 53: S\n      Turn 54: U\n      Turn 55: U\n      Turn 56: U\n      Turn 57: U\n      Turn 58: U\n      Turn 59: U\n\n  However, is there a way to do it in 9 actions? \n\n  We must be at9 at turn59? \n      That means we do 9 actions: from50 to58, and then at59 we are at9.\n      We start at4 at50.\n      After 9 actions, the net movement must be +5 (to go from4 to9).\n\n      The net movement: \n          Let u be number of U, d be number of D, s be number of S, then u - d = 5, and u+d+s=9.\n\n      So u = d+5, then 2d+5+s=9 -> 2d+s=4.\n\n      Possible: \n          d=0, s=4, then u=5 -> 5U,0D,4S -> net 5, and total 9 actions.\n          d=1, s=2, then u=6 -> net 5, total 9 actions.\n          d=2, s=0, then u=7 -> net 5, total 9 actions.\n\n      We need to check if we can avoid collisions.\n\n      Option1: 5U, 4S: \n          We start at4. We have to avoid the dangerous turns and dangerous rows.\n\n          We must not be on row8 at turn54, and also avoid other dangerous positions.\n\n          We also have to distribute the 4S somewhere.\n\n          We want to be as high as possible as soon as possible, but then avoid row4-8 at turn54.\n\n          How about:\n              turn50: S\n              turn51: S\n              turn52: S\n              turn53: S\n              then turns54-58: U five times.\n\n          But then at turn54: we are at4 -> dangerous.\n\n          How about:\n              turn50: U\n              turn51: U\n              turn52: U\n              turn53: U -> then at turn54: we are at8 -> dangerous.\n\n          How about:\n              turn50: U (5)\n              turn51: U (6)\n              turn52: U (7)\n              turn53: S (7) -> then at turn54:7 -> dangerous.\n          turn54: U (8) -> dangerous too? but we are at7 at turn54: dangerous.\n\n          How about insert a down somewhere:\n\n          Option2: 6U, 1D, 2S: net 5.\n          For example:\n              turn50: U (5)\n              turn51: U (6)\n              turn52: U (7)\n              turn53: D (6) -> then at turn54:6 -> dangerous.\n          turn54: ... \n\n          Or:\n              turn50: U (5)\n              turn51: S (5)\n              turn52: S (5)\n              turn53: D (4) -> then at turn54:4 -> dangerous.\n\n          Or:\n              turn50: U (5)\n              turn51: U (6)\n              turn52: D (5)\n              turn53: S (5) -> then at turn54:5 -> dangerous.\n\n          It seems we cannot avoid being on a dangerous row at turn54 if we are above row3 at turn54.\n\n      Option3: 7U, 2D: net 5, with no stays.\n          Example:\n              turn50: U (5)\n              turn51: U (6)\n              turn52: U (7)\n              turn53: D (6) -> then at turn54:6 -> dangerous.\n\n          Or:\n              turn50: D (3) \n              turn51: U (4)\n              turn52: U (5)\n              turn53: U (6) -> then at turn54:6 -> dangerous.\n\n          Or:\n              turn50: U (5)\n              turn51: D (4)\n              turn52: U (5)\n              turn53: U (6) -> then at turn54:6 -> dangerous.\n\n      So I don't see a 9-action sequence.\n\n  Therefore, minimal H is 10.\n\n  But note: there is another danger: freeway1,2,3 at turns56-59. In our plan, we are on row4 at55, row5 at56, row6 at57, row7 at58, row8 at59. \n\n  At turn56: we are at5? \n        freeway5: dangerous at54 -> safe.\n        But freeway1,2,3: dangerous at56-59, but we are not on freeway1,2,3 (we are on5, which is freeway5) -> safe.\n\n  Similarly, at57: row6: freeway6 -> safe from freeway1,2,3.\n\n  However, at turn59: we are at8? freeway8: dangerous at54 -> safe at59.\n\n  So safe.\n\n  Therefore, the answer is the 10-action sequence.\n\n  However, note that in the sequence we have 3 S at row3. We could do D at one of these to go to2 and then come back? but that would not help and might add more moves.\n\n  We can also consider moving to row2 and then come back, but that would require more moves.\n\n  So we stick to the plan.\n\n  But wait: what if we do not use all S? we could do:\n\n      turn50: D (to3 at51)\n      turn51: D (to2 at52)\n      turn52: U (to3 at53)\n      turn53: S (to3 at54)\n      then same as before: 6 ups to9.\n\n      That is also 10 actions.\n\n      And at turn54: row3 -> safe.\n\n      Is it safe during the moves?\n          turn50: row4 -> safe.\n          turn51: row3 -> safe.\n          turn52: row2 -> safe (freeway2: dangerous at56-59 -> safe at52)\n          turn53: row3 -> safe.\n\n      Then same as before.\n\n  But that is also 10 actions.\n\n  We can choose any as long as we are at row3 (or below) at turn54.\n\n  But the problem is to minimize H, and both are 10.\n\n  We can also do:\n\n      turn50: D (3)\n      turn51: S (3)\n      turn52: S (3)\n      turn53: S (3)\n      turn54: U (4)\n      turn55: U (5)\n      turn56: U (6)\n      turn57: U (7)\n      turn58: U (8)\n      turn59: U (9)\n\n  This is the same as before.\n\n  But note: at turn58: we are at8. \n      Is freeway8 dangerous at turn58? \n          freeway8: dangerous at54 -> safe at58.\n\n  And at turn59: we are at9: goal.\n\n  But wait: we are at9 at turn59? \n        We did U at59: then at turn60 we are at9? \n\n        But the problem: after H actions, we are at turn50+H, and we require y_{50+H}=9.\n\n        Here H=10: actions at50 to59: then at turn60 we are at9? \n\n        But in the sequence above, after the last U at59, we are at9 at60.\n\n        So we are at9 at turn60.\n\n        But the goal is to reach (0,9) at the turn after the last action? \n\n        The problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" meaning that after the last action we are at (0,9). \n\n        How the update works: \n            At turn50 (t1=50) we start at (0,4).\n            We do action a50: then at turn51 we are at y51 = y50 + Δy50.\n            ...\n            After the last action at turn50+H-1 (which is 50+10-1=59), then at turn60 we are at y60.\n\n        So we require y60=9.\n\n        In our plan: y60=9.\n\n        So it's correct.\n\n  Therefore, we output the sequence for H=10.\n\n  But note: we can also do:\n\n      turn50: D\n      turn51: D\n      turn52: U\n      turn53: S\n      turn54: U\n      turn55: U\n      turn56: U\n      turn57: U\n      turn58: U\n      turn59: U\n\n  Let me check the positions:\n\n      t50: start at4 -> do D: y51=3.\n      t51: do D: y52=2.\n      t52: do U: y53=3.\n      t53: do S: y54=3.  [safe at54]\n      t54: U: y55=4.\n      t55: U: y56=5.\n      t56: U: y57=6.\n      t57: U: y58=7.\n      t58: U: y59=8.\n      t59: U: y60=9.\n\n  This also works and is 10 actions.\n\n  And it's safe at every step.\n\n  Which one is better? Both have the same number of actions.\n\n  We can choose either.\n\n  Let me choose the first one I thought of: \n      turn50: D\n      turn51: S\n      turn52: S\n      turn53: S\n      turn54: U\n      turn55: U\n      turn56: U\n      turn57: U\n      turn58: U\n      turn59: U\n\n  But note: in the sequence above, we are at row3 for turns51,52,53,54? \n      At turn54: we are at3 (because we did S at53: so at54 we are at3) and then we do U at54: so at55 we are at4.\n\n  So the position at each turn:\n\n      turn50: y50=4 (before any action at50) -> then we do D at50: so at51:3.\n      turn51: at51 we are at3, do S: at52:3.\n      turn52: at52:3, do S: at53:3.\n      turn53: at53:3, do S: at54:3.\n      turn54: at54:3, do U: at55:4.\n      turn55: at55:4, do U: at56:5.\n      turn56: at56:5, do U: at57:6.\n      turn57: at57:6, do U: at58:7.\n      turn58: at58:7, do U: at59:8.\n      turn59: at59:8, do U: at60:9.\n\n  So we reach at60.\n\n  We can also do the second plan: \n      turn50: D -> to3 at51\n      turn51: D -> to2 at52\n      turn52: U -> to3 at53\n      turn53: S -> to3 at54\n      turn54: U -> to4 at55\n      turn55: U -> to5 at56\n      turn56: U -> to6 at57\n      turn57: U -> to7 at58\n      turn58: U -> to8 at59\n      turn59: U -> to9 at60\n\n  Both are valid.\n\n  I'll choose the first one for simplicity.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=10.\n\n  Is there a way with H=9? We could not find one.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 50: D\nTurn 51: S\nTurn 52: S\nTurn 53: S\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\nTurn 57: U\nTurn 58: U\nTurn 59: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the current turn is t1=50. The player is at (0,4) at turn50. Then we start by doing D at turn50.\n\nWe must write the actions for turns50,51,...,59.\n\nNote: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so t=0 to H-1: \n   t=0: a50\n   t=1: a51\n   ...\n   t=9: a59\n\nSo the above is correct.\n\nHowever, let me double-check the collision at every step:\n\n  turn50: we are at row4 at turn50 (when we start) -> safe. Then we do D: so at turn51 we are at row3.\n\n  turn51: we are at row3 -> safe (freeway3 dangerous only at56-59). Then we do S: so at turn52 we are at row3.\n\n  turn52: row3 -> safe. Then S: at53: row3.\n\n  turn53: row3 -> safe. Then S: at54: row3.\n\n  turn54: row3 -> safe. Then U: at55: row4.\n\n        freeway4 at turn55: dangerous at52,53,54,62-64 -> not 55 -> safe.\n\n  turn55: row4 -> safe. Then U: at56: row5.\n\n        freeway5: dangerous at54 and50 -> not56 -> safe.\n\n  turn56: row5 -> safe. Then U: at57: row6.\n\n        freeway6: dangerous at54 -> safe.\n\n  turn57: row6 -> safe. Then U: at58: row7.\n\n        freeway7: dangerous at54 -> safe.\n\n  turn58: row7 -> safe. Then U: at59: row8.\n\n        freeway8: dangerous at54 -> safe.\n\n  turn59: row8 -> safe. Then U: at60: row9 -> goal.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nWe could also consider a plan that uses a down earlier and then an extra up, but it's the same length.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn 50, while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 10. The sequence of actions is designed to avoid dangerous rows during critical turns, specifically ensuring the player is not on rows 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 at turn 54, when these rows are hazardous due to car positions.\n\n- **Initial Position (Turn 50):** The player is at \\((0, 4)\\). Freeway 4 is safe at turn 50 (dangerous at turns 52, 53, 54, 62, 63, 64).\n- **Action at Turn 50 (D):** Move down to row 3. At turn 51, the player is at \\((0, 3)\\). Freeway 3 is safe at turn 51 (dangerous at turns 56–59).\n- **Actions at Turns 51, 52, 53 (S, S, S):** Stay at row 3. This ensures the player remains in a safe row (3) during turns 51–54. Freeway 3 is safe in this period.\n- **Action at Turn 54 (U):** Move up to row 4. At turn 55, the player is at \\((0, 4)\\). Freeway 4 is safe at turn 55 (not dangerous at turn 55).\n- **Actions at Turns 55–59 (U, U, U, U, U):** Move up consecutively to rows 5, 6, 7, 8, and finally 9. Each row during these turns is safe:\n  - Turn 55 (row 4): Safe (freeway 4 not dangerous).\n  - Turn 56 (row 5): Safe (freeway 5 dangerous only at turns 50 and 54).\n  - Turn 57 (row 6): Safe (freeway 6 dangerous only at turn 54).\n  - Turn 58 (row 7): Safe (freeway 7 dangerous only at turn 54).\n  - Turn 59 (row 8): Safe (freeway 8 dangerous only at turn 54).\n- **Final Position (Turn 60):** After the last action at turn 59 (U), the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 60.\n\nThis sequence avoids all collisions and reaches the goal in the minimal number of turns (10 actions from turn 50 to 59, with the goal achieved at turn 60).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 50: D\nTurn 51: S\nTurn 52: S\nTurn 53: S\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\nTurn 57: U\nTurn 58: U\nTurn 59: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 54 and the player starts at (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8). We can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The movement is constrained so that y must be between 0 and 9.\n\nThe car update rules tell us that for a car with initial (at t1=54) head h, tail tau, direction d, and speed s, at a future turn T (T>54), the car's span becomes:\n- If left-moving (d = left): [h - s*(T-54), tau - s*(T-54)]\n- If right-moving (d = right): [tau + s*(T-54), h + s*(T-54)]\n\nNote: The table shows that all cars in this state are right-moving. So we use the right-moving formula.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) at turn T and the x-coordinate 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is only considered to be on freeway y_T at turn T. So when we are at turn T and we decide to move (U or D), then at turn T we are on the old row and at turn T+1 we are on the new row. Therefore, we only check the car on the freeway corresponding to the row we are on at that turn.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions from turn 54 onwards until we reach row 9.\n\nLet me denote:\n- t0 = 54 is the starting turn (turn index 0 in our sequence).\n- We are at row 0 at turn 54.\n\nWe must avoid rows 1 to 8 at the moments when there is a car at x=0 on that row.\n\nWe are going to simulate the movement and check for collisions. Since we want minimal H, we try to move up as fast as possible, but we must avoid the cars.\n\nHowever, note that we start at row 0 and we are safe there because the freeways start at row 1. We need to get to row 9, which is also safe (no cars).\n\nThe challenge is the cars on rows 1 to 8.\n\nLet me list the cars for each row (freeway k) at turn 54:\n\nRow 1: one car: (-48, -59, right, 3) -> note: head is -48, tail is -59? This seems backward because for a right-moving car, typically the head is the front which is the larger x? But the update rule for right-moving says: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So the car's span at time T is [tau + s*(T-54), h + s*(T-54)].\n\nBut note: the car is given as (head, tail) = (-48, -59). Since it's right-moving, the tail is the leftmost point and the head is the rightmost? Actually, the problem says for a right-moving car: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning that at time t1, the car occupies from tau to h (with tau < h). But here we have h=-48 and tau=-59. Since -48 > -59, that means the head is at -48 and the tail at -59? Actually, the problem states: for right-moving, the span at t1 is [tau, h] and then at T it becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So the car is moving to the right.\n\nBut note: the given car on row 1: (-48, -59, right, 3). The head is -48 and tail is -59? That would imply the car is from x=-59 to x=-48? That's 12 units long? But let me compute: -59 to -48 is 11 units? Actually, the length is |h - tau| + 1? But we don't care about the exact length, we care about whether 0 is in the interval.\n\nSimilarly, row 2: same as row 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\nrow 3: same.\n\nRow 4: three cars: \n  car1: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n  car2: (-12, -23, right, 4)\n  car3: (24, 13, right, 4) -> wait, 24 and 13? Then 13 is the tail and 24 the head? But 13<24 so that's consistent. But wait, the problem says: for a right-moving car, the span is [tau, h] meaning tau should be the left and h the right. But here the car is given as (head, tail) = (24,13) meaning head=24, tail=13? Then the car spans from 13 to 24? But then at time T, the span is [13+4*(T-54), 24+4*(T-54)].\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, ...)\". For a right-moving car, the head is the front (rightmost) and the tail is the back (leftmost). So the car spans [tau, h]. So for (24,13): from 13 to 24.\n\nBut note: the second car on row4: (-12, -23) -> then the car spans from -23 to -12? \n\nRow5: two cars: \n  car1: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n  car2: (0, -11, right, 12) -> this one: head=0, tail=-11? Then the car at t1=54 is from -11 to 0? So at t1=54, the car is at x=-11 to x=0. Therefore, at turn 54, if the player is on row5 at x=0, then 0 is in the interval? But note: the player is at (0,0) at turn54, and row5 is freeway k=5 (which is y=5) so we are not on row5 at turn54. But we might be at row5 in a future turn.\n\nSimilarly, rows 6,7,8 have the same two cars: \n  (-48, -59, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nNow, we must avoid being on row k (for k=1..8) at any turn T when there is a car on row k that has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nWe are going to simulate the future positions of the cars.\n\nLet me denote dt = T - 54 (so dt>=0).\n\nFor a car (h, tau, d, s) at t1=54, at time T=54+dt:\n  if d='right': the car spans [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]\n\nWe need to check for each row and each car on that row whether 0 is in [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt] at the turn when we are on that row.\n\nWe are going to plan a path. Since we start at row0 and want to get to row9, and we can only move one row per turn at most, the minimal number of turns is 9 (if we move up every turn). But we must avoid the cars.\n\nSo let's check if we can go straight up without stopping.\n\nWe would be:\nTurn54 (t0): at row0 -> safe (not on freeway)\nTurn55: move U to row1 -> now we are on row1 at turn55. Check row1 at turn55.\n\nRow1 has one car: (-48, -59, right, 3). \nAt T=55, dt=1: \n   tau + s*dt = -59 + 3*1 = -56\n   h + s*dt = -48 + 3*1 = -45\nSo the car spans [-56, -45]. 0 is not in this interval -> safe.\n\nTurn56: move U to row2 at turn56.\nRow2: same car as row1? The car on row2: (-48, -59, right, 3). \nAt T=56, dt=2: \n   [-59+3*2, -48+3*2] = [-53, -42] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nTurn57: move U to row3 at turn57.\nRow3: same car -> at T=57, dt=3: [-59+9, -48+9] = [-50, -39] -> safe.\n\nTurn58: move U to row4 at turn58.\nRow4: has three cars. We must check all three at T=58 (dt=4):\n  car1: (-48, -59, right, 4) -> [ -59+4*4, -48+4*4 ] = [ -59+16, -48+16 ] = [-43, -32] -> 0 not in.\n  car2: (-12, -23, right, 4) -> [ -23+16, -12+16 ] = [ -7, 4 ] -> note: 0 is in [-7,4]? Yes, because -7<=0<=4.\n  car3: (24, 13, right, 4) -> [13+16, 24+16] = [29,40] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo at turn58, on row4, we would collide with car2. Therefore, we cannot go to row4 at turn58.\n\nSo we must avoid being on row4 at turn58.\n\nWe have a few options:\n1. Delay the move to row4 by one or more turns? But note we are at row3 at turn57. We can either stay at row3 for one turn (so at turn58 we are still at row3) and then move to row4 at turn59? Or we could even go down? But going down would be away from the goal.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to adjust the timing so that when we are on row4, the car2 is not at x=0.\n\nLet's check car2 on row4: at time T, the car spans [ -23 + 4*(T-54), -12 + 4*(T-54) ]\n\nWe want to avoid having 0 in that interval. So:\n  -23 + 4*(dt) <= 0 <= -12 + 4*(dt)\n\nSolve:\n  -23 + 4*dt <= 0  => 4*dt <= 23 => dt <= 5.75 -> so dt<=5\n  and 0 <= -12 + 4*dt => 4*dt >= 12 => dt>=3.\n\nSo for dt in [3,5] (inclusive) the car2 will be at x=0? Actually, the interval is [left, right] and 0 is in if left<=0<=right.\n\ndt=3: left = -23+12 = -11, right = -12+12=0 -> so [ -11, 0] -> 0 is included? Yes, because the interval is inclusive? The problem says \"Span\", and collision if 0 is in the span. So yes.\n\ndt=4: [-23+16, -12+16] = [-7,4] -> 0 is in.\n\ndt=5: [-23+20, -12+20] = [-3,8] -> 0 is in.\n\ndt=6: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\ndt=7: [5,16] -> not.\n\nSo we must be on row4 at a turn T such that dt = T-54 is not 3,4,5. So we can avoid by being on row4 at dt>=6 or dt<3.\n\nBut note: we are at row3 at turn57 (dt=3). We cannot get to row4 at dt<3 because we start at row0 and we need at least 4 moves to get to row4 (0->1->2->3->4) so the earliest we can be at row4 is turn58 (dt=4). So we cannot get there at dt<3.\n\nTherefore, we must be at row4 at dt>=6. So the earliest we can be at row4 is turn54+6 = turn60.\n\nBut then we have to get to row4 at turn60. How?\n\nFrom turn57 (at row3) we can wait for 3 turns: \n  turn57: row3 (we are there at the start of turn57, then we do action S -> stay at row3 at turn58)\n  turn58: row3 (then S -> row3 at turn59)\n  turn59: row3 (then U -> row4 at turn60)\n\nSo then at turn60: dt=6 -> row4: check car2: [ -23+4*6, -12+4*6] = [ -23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nBut we also have to check the other cars on row4 at turn60:\n  car1: [-59+4*6, -48+4*6] = [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n  car3: [13+24, 24+24] = [37,48] -> safe.\n\nSo row4 is safe at turn60.\n\nNow, what about the other rows? We still have to go from row4 to row9.\n\nWe are at row4 at turn60. Then we want to move up.\n\nTurn61: move U to row5 at turn61 (dt=7).\nRow5: two cars. Check at T=61 (dt=7):\n  car1: (-48, -59, right, 12) -> [ -59 + 12*7, -48 + 12*7 ] = [ -59+84, -48+84] = [25,36] -> safe.\n  car2: (0, -11, right, 12) -> [ -11 + 12*7, 0 + 12*7 ] = [ -11+84, 84] = [73,84] -> safe.\n\nTurn62: move U to row6 at turn62 (dt=8).\nRow6: same as row5? \n  car1: [-59+12*8, -48+12*8] = [-59+96, -48+96] = [37,48] -> safe.\n  car2: [-11+96, 0+96] = [85,96] -> safe.\n\nTurn63: move U to row7 at turn63 (dt=9).\n  car1: [-59+12*9, -48+12*9] = [-59+108, -48+108] = [49,60] -> safe.\n  car2: [-11+108, 0+108] = [97,108] -> safe.\n\nTurn64: move U to row8 at turn64 (dt=10).\n  car1: [-59+12*10, -48+12*10] = [61,72] -> safe.\n  car2: [-11+120, 0+120] = [109,120] -> safe.\n\nTurn65: move U to row9 at turn65 -> safe (row9 is not a freeway).\n\nSo the entire sequence would be:\n\nTurn54: start at row0 -> we need to do an action to move to row1 at turn55? Actually, at turn54 we are at row0. We can choose to move up to row1 at the next turn.\n\nBut note: we are at turn54, and we are going to do an action at turn54 to determine the next state.\n\nSo:\nTurn54: action U -> then at turn55: y=1.\nTurn55: U -> turn56: y=2.\nTurn56: U -> turn57: y=3.\nThen we have to wait at row3 for 3 turns? So:\nTurn57: S -> stay at row3 (so at turn58: still row3)\nTurn58: S -> turn59: row3\nTurn59: U -> turn60: row4\nTurn60: U -> turn61: row5\nTurn61: U -> turn62: row6\nTurn62: U -> turn63: row7\nTurn63: U -> turn64: row8\nTurn64: U -> turn65: row9.\n\nTotal turns: from turn54 to turn65: 12 actions (H=12) and we reach at turn65.\n\nBut let me count: \n  turn54: action0 -> to row1 at turn55\n  turn55: action1 -> to row2 at turn56\n  turn56: action2 -> to row3 at turn57\n  turn57: action3 (S) -> row3 at turn58\n  turn58: action4 (S) -> row3 at turn59\n  turn59: action5 (U) -> row4 at turn60\n  turn60: action6 (U) -> row5 at turn61\n  turn61: action7 (U) -> row6 at turn62\n  turn62: action8 (U) -> row7 at turn63\n  turn63: action9 (U) -> row8 at turn64\n  turn64: action10 (U) -> row9 at turn65\n\nSo we have 11 actions? Because we start at turn54 and do 11 actions (t=0 to t=10) and then at turn54+10 = turn64 we do the last action and then at the next state (turn65) we are at row9. But the problem says: we have a sequence of actions for t=0 to H-1 and we want to reach at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThe problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we are at turn t1+H-1 at row9.\n\nWe start at turn54 (t1). We do H actions: at t=0 (turn54), t=1 (turn55), ... t=H-1 (turn54+H-1). Then the state after the last action is at turn54+H. But the problem says we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nWait, the player update: at turn t, we do action a_t and then we get y_{t+1}. So if we start at turn54 (t1) at y54=0, then after doing a_54 (the first action) we get y55. Then after the last action a_{t1+H-1} we get y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\" ? \n\nLet me read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\nThis is a bit confusing. \n\nAt turn t1 (54), we are at (0,0). Then we do the first action at turn t1 (54) to get the state at turn t1+1 (55). \n\nAfter k actions, we are at turn t1+k. But the problem says we want y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo if we do H actions, the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then the state we get is at turn t1+H. But they want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9? \n\nThat would mean that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? But no, the state is updated at the end of the turn.\n\nActually, the problem says: we are given the state at turn t1 (54). Then we choose an action for turn t1, which updates to state at turn t1+1. Then we choose an action for turn t1+1, which updates to state at turn t1+2, and so on. We want that at the state at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nBut note: the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state after we have done H-1 actions? \n\nLet me define:\n- At turn t1: state is (0,0). Then we do action a_{t1} -> we get state at turn t1+1: y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + delta.\n- Then at turn t1+1: we do a_{t1+1} -> state at turn t1+2: y_{t1+2}.\n- ...\n- At turn t1+k: we do a_{t1+k} -> state at turn t1+k+1.\n\nWe want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). But the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state that we have at the beginning of the turn? Or after the action of the previous turn? \n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". And we know that at turn t1 we have y_{t1}=0.\n\nSo if we let H be the number of actions, then after k actions, we are at turn t1+k? \n\nActually, the state at turn t is the state at the beginning of the turn? Then we do an action during the turn to update to the next state.\n\nBut the problem does not explicitly say. However, note the collision condition: collision occurs at turn T if at that turn (presumably when we are at the state at the beginning of turn T? or after the action of turn T?) we are on a freeway and a car is at 0.\n\nBut the note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". This implies that at turn T, we are still on y_T. Then after the action, we move to y_{T+1} at the next turn.\n\nTherefore, the state at the beginning of turn T is (0, y_T). Then we do an action a_T, and then we are at (0, y_{T+1}) at the beginning of turn T+1.\n\nSo the state at turn T is (0, y_T). We want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). That means that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). How many actions have we taken to get there? \n\nWe start at turn t1 (54) at (0,0). Then we do actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2 to get to (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo the number of actions is H-1? But the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, meaning H actions? \n\nLet me re-read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we have H actions: at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the state after these H actions would be at turn t1+H. But we want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). \n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nLooking at the problem: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nAnd the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so the actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nBut then the state at the end of the last action (at turn t1+H) would be the state after turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut we want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). \n\nThis suggests that we do not need to do an action at turn t1+H-1 to be at 9 at that turn? \n\nAlternatively, the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state we have at the beginning of the turn, and we do an action at that turn to update to the next state. But we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, so we don't need to do an action? But the sequence must include an action for that turn? \n\nI think the problem intends: we are to provide a sequence of H actions (from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1) such that after the last action, we have reached (0,9) at the next state, which is turn t1+H. But then the problem says \"reach at turn t1+H-1\", which would be the state after H-1 actions? \n\nAlternatively, the minimal H might be defined as the number of turns we wait until we are at (0,9). \n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has H actions (from t=0 to H-1). And we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo if H=1: then we do one action at turn t1 (54) and then at turn t1+0? wait, t1+H-1 = t1+0? That doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me index: \n  t0 = t1 (54) -> state y0 = 0.\n  We do an action at time t1 (which is t0) and then we get state at time t1+1 (t1+1) = y1.\n\nBut we want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\nSo if H=1, then we want at turn t1+0 (which is turn54) to be 9. But we start at 0, so we cannot.\n\nIf H=2: then we do actions at turns t1 and t1+1 (t0 and t1). Then we want at turn t1+1 to be 9.\n\nSo we do an action at turn54: that moves us to y1 at turn55 (which is t1+1). We want y1=9. But we can only move by +1 per turn, so we cannot get to 9 in one move.\n\nTherefore, we must have H>=10? Because we start at 0 and we need to be at 9, which takes at least 9 moves. So the earliest we can be at 9 is turn54+9? So at turn63 (because 54+9=63) we are at 9? Then H-1 = 9? So H=10? Then we do 10 actions? But then the last action is at turn63? and then we are at 9 at turn64? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me try to express:\n\nWe want: at turn T = t1 + H - 1 = 54 + H - 1, we are at y=9.\n\nHow do we get to y=9 at turn T? We must have taken an action at turn T-1 that moved us to 9 at turn T? Or we might have been at 9 at turn T-1 and then we do nothing? But the action at turn T-1 would have moved us from 8 to 9 at turn T.\n\nSo if we are at 9 at turn T, then we got there by an action at turn T-1.\n\nTherefore, the action at turn T-1 is U (from 8 to 9). Then we are at 9 at turn T.\n\nIn our sequence, the last action is at turn T-1? \n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. \n\nWe want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\nSo the last action in the sequence is at turn t1+H-1. Then after that action, the state is at turn t1+H. But we want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9? \n\nThat means that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are already at 9. Then we do an action at that turn? But that action would move us to 10? which is not allowed. Or we do S? then we stay at 9. But then we are at 9 at the next state too? \n\nBut the problem says: we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. And we are allowed to do an action at that turn? But if we are already at 9, we can do S.\n\nBut how did we get to 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? That must be by the previous actions.\n\nSo the sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-2 must have gotten us to 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we do an action at turn t1+H-1 (which must be S) to stay at 9? But then we are still at 9 at the next state? \n\nBut the problem doesn't say we have to stop; it only says to reach (0,9). So we can do S at the last turn to remain.\n\nHowever, note that the goal is to reach (0,9). Once we are there, we can stop? But the problem requires a sequence of H actions until we are at 9 at the turn t1+H-1.\n\nAlternatively, we can reach 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 without doing an action at that turn? But the sequence includes an action at that turn.\n\nSo to avoid confusion, let me think about the minimal time to reach 9.\n\nThe fastest: we start at turn54 at row0. We can be at row1 at turn55, row2 at turn56, ..., row9 at turn63. So at turn63, we are at row9. This is turn54+9 = 63. So the state at turn63 is (0,9). Then we must have H-1 = 9? So H=10. And we do actions at turns54 to 63? That is 10 actions.\n\nBut what are the actions? \n  At turn54: U -> to row1 at turn55.\n  At turn55: U -> to row2 at turn56.\n  ...\n  At turn62: U -> to row9 at turn63.\n\nThen the last action is at turn62? Then we are at row9 at turn63. So the state at turn63 (which is t1+9) is (0,9). Then H-1=9? So H=10. Then the sequence is 10 actions: at turns54,55,...,63? But that would be 10 actions: turn54 to turn63.\n\nBut then the last action (at turn63) would be done when we are already at row9? And we would do S? because we don't want to move. But the problem says we must reach at turn t1+H-1 = 54+10-1 = 63. So we are at 9 at turn63. And we do an action at turn63? which we can choose S.\n\nBut note: we are at row9 at the beginning of turn63? Then we do an action at turn63 to update to turn64. We want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn63? That doesn't require an action at turn63 to get to 9? \n\nActually, we got to 9 at the beginning of turn63 by the action at turn62 (which was U from row8 to row9). Then at turn63 we are at row9. Then we do an action at turn63 (S) to stay at row9 at turn64? But the state at turn63 is already 9, so we have reached at turn63. But the action at turn63 is part of the sequence? \n\nThe problem requires a sequence of H actions that result in being at 9 at turn t1+H-1. So if we do 10 actions, then turn t1+H-1 = 54+10-1=63. And we are at 9 at the beginning of turn63? Then we do an action at turn63? \n\nBut the collision check: at turn63, we are at row9? and row9 is not a freeway, so no car collision. Then we do S. \n\nBut the goal is to be at 9 at turn63, and we are. So it's okay.\n\nHowever, in our earlier plan we had to wait for row4, so we cannot do the straight 9 moves.\n\nIn our plan we are at row9 at turn65. So we want to be at row9 at turn65. Then t1+H-1 = 54+H-1 = 65 -> H-1=11 -> H=12.\n\nThen we do 12 actions: from turn54 to turn65? But then the state at turn65 is row9? How did we get there? By the action at turn64 (U from row8 to row9) so at turn65 we are at row9. Then we do an action at turn65? We must do an action at turn65? But we are already at row9. So we do S.\n\nBut the state at turn65 is row9, which is the goal. And the turn65 is t1+H-1 = 54+12-1=65. So that matches.\n\nSo in our plan:\n\nWe start at turn54: row0.\nAfter 11 actions (from turn54 to turn64) we are at row9 at turn65? \nWait, no:\n\nAction at turn54: U -> turn55: row1\nAction at turn55: U -> turn56: row2\nAction at turn56: U -> turn57: row3\nAction at turn57: S -> turn58: row3\nAction at turn58: S -> turn59: row3\nAction at turn59: U -> turn60: row4\nAction at turn60: U -> turn61: row5\nAction at turn61: U -> turn62: row6\nAction at turn62: U -> turn63: row7\nAction at turn63: U -> turn64: row8\nAction at turn64: U -> turn65: row9\n\nSo at the beginning of turn65, we are at row9. And we have done 11 actions (t=0 to 10). Then we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 54+H-1 = 65. So 54+H-1=65 -> H-1=11 -> H=12.\n\nTherefore, we need 12 actions: from turn54 to turn65? But that is 12 actions? \n\nActually, the actions are at: \n  t=0: turn54\n  t=1: turn55\n  ...\n  t=11: turn65.\n\nBut we have already reached row9 at the beginning of turn65? Then at turn65 we do an action? We can do S to stay.\n\nBut note: the action at turn65 would be the 12th action. And then the state after that action is turn66: which is row9. But the problem requires that at turn65 (which is t1+11) we are at row9. We are at row9 at the beginning of turn65? Then we do the action at turn65? \n\nThe problem says: we are to provide actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1. For H=12, that is turns54 to 65. And we want the state at turn t1+H-1 = 65 to be (0,9). \n\nBut the state at the beginning of turn65 is (0,9) because we got there by the action at turn64. Then we do an action at turn65? \n\nBut the collision condition: at turn65 we are at row9, which is safe. Then we do S. \n\nSo the sequence includes 12 actions.\n\nBut we only did 11 actions to get to row9? The 12th action is just to satisfy the sequence length? \n\nAlternatively, we can consider that we don't need to do an action after we are at 9? But the problem says the sequence has H actions and we must be at 9 at the last state of the sequence? \n\nBut the problem says: we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. And we are doing an action at that turn? \n\nI think the intended meaning is: after doing the sequence of H actions (which are taken at turns t1 to t1+H-1), the state at the end of these actions (i.e., at turn t1+H) is not specified? But the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo if we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we are good. Then we do an action at turn t1+H-1, and then we go to the next state, but we don't care as long as we are at 9 at the beginning of that turn.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\nAt turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9) at the beginning. Then we do an action (which can be S, U, or D). But if we do U, we go to 10 which is invalid? The movement rule says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So we cannot go to 10. Similarly, D would go to 8, which is not 9. So we must do S.\n\nSo in our sequence, the last action must be S if we are already at 9 at the beginning of that turn.\n\nBut how did we get to 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? By the previous actions.\n\nIn the example of the straight move: we get to 9 at turn63 (which is t1+9) by the action at turn62. Then at turn63 (which is the 9th turn after t1, so t1+9) we are at 9. Then we do S at turn63. Then the sequence has 10 actions: 9 moves up and then one S? \n\nBut we only need 9 moves to get to 9. Then we do an extra S at the last turn? \n\nBut the minimal H: we want the minimal H such that we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1. The earliest turn we can be at 9 is turn63 (t1+9). Then we set H=10, and we do 10 actions: 9 U's and then one S at the last turn? \n\nBut the problem says minimal number of turns H. So H=10 is minimal? But in our case we have to wait, so we take 12 turns? \n\nBut note: the minimal H is the number of turns we wait? Or the length of the action sequence? \n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has H actions. \n\nSo if we can be at 9 at turn63, then H=10. But we cannot because of the car on row4. So we have to wait until turn60 to be on row4? Then we get to row9 at turn65? So the earliest we can be at row9 is turn65. Then we set H=12? \n\nBut let me check: at turn65, we are at row9. So we want to be at row9 at turn t1+H-1 = 54+H-1 = 65 -> H-1=11 -> H=12.\n\nThen we do 12 actions: from turn54 to turn65. The actions:\n\n  turn54: U\n  turn55: U\n  turn56: U\n  turn57: S\n  turn58: S\n  turn59: U\n  turn60: U\n  turn61: U\n  turn62: U\n  turn63: U\n  turn64: U   -> this gets us to row9 at turn65 (the beginning of turn65).\n  turn65: S   -> then we stay at row9 at turn66.\n\nBut at the beginning of turn65, we are at row9. So we have reached the goal at turn65. The action at turn65 is just to complete the sequence.\n\nIs there a faster way? We took 11 moves (with 2 waits) and then one extra S at the end. Total 12 actions.\n\nBut can we avoid the two waits? We had to wait at row3 for 2 extra turns? Actually, we waited for 3 turns at row3? From turn57 to turn59: three turns? \n\nAt turn57: we are at row3 (after moving up from row2 at turn56). Then we do:\n  turn57: S -> remain at row3 for turn58.\n  turn58: S -> remain at row3 for turn59.\n  turn59: U -> to row4 at turn60.\n\nSo that's 3 actions at row3: two S and then one U? But the time spent: we are at row3 from turn57 to turn60? \n\nBut note: we are at row3 at the beginning of turn57, then we do S -> so at the beginning of turn58 we are still at row3. Similarly, at the beginning of turn59 we are at row3. Then we do U at turn59 -> at the beginning of turn60 we are at row4.\n\nSo we spent turns57,58,59 at row3? That's 3 turns.\n\nBut we only needed to wait until dt=6 (turn60) for row4. The earliest we could be at row4 is turn58? But at turn58 (dt=4) the car is there. The next safe time is turn60 (dt=6). We arrived at row3 at turn57 (dt=3). So we can only leave at turn59 (to be at row4 at turn60). So we must wait two turns? \n\nAt turn57: we are at row3. We can do:\n  turn57: S -> then at turn58: row3\n  turn58: S -> then at turn59: row3\n  turn59: U -> then at turn60: row4.\n\nThat is two S actions and then U. So we did two waits? \n\nBut the actions: turn57: S, turn58: S, turn59: U. That's three actions? But the waiting is done by the S actions.\n\nTotal actions: \n  from turn54 to turn56: 3 U's -> to row3 at turn57.\n  then turn57: S\n  turn58: S\n  turn59: U -> to row4 at turn60.\n  then turn60 to turn64: 5 U's -> to row9 at turn65.\n  turn65: S.\n\nCount: 3 (U) + 2 (S) + 1 (U) + 5 (U) + 1 (S) = 12 actions.\n\nBut the moves: \n  turn54: U -> row1 at turn55\n  turn55: U -> row2 at turn56\n  turn56: U -> row3 at turn57\n  turn57: S -> row3 at turn58\n  turn58: S -> row3 at turn59\n  turn59: U -> row4 at turn60\n  turn60: U -> row5 at turn61\n  turn61: U -> row6 at turn62\n  turn62: U -> row7 at turn63\n  turn63: U -> row8 at turn64\n  turn64: U -> row9 at turn65\n  turn65: S -> row9 at turn66\n\nAnd we are at row9 at the beginning of turn65? And we do S at turn65 to remain.\n\nBut the goal is to be at row9 at turn65 (the beginning) which we are. So we don't really need the last S? But the sequence must have 12 actions? \n\nThe problem says: we must provide a sequence of H actions. And H=12. So we have to include the action at turn65.\n\nBut note: the collision condition: at turn65, we are at row9 -> safe. Then we do S -> safe.\n\nSo it's okay.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in H=11? Then we would be at row9 at turn54+11-1=64. So at turn64 we are at row9.\n\nTo be at row9 at turn64, we must have been at row8 at turn63 and then done U at turn63 to get to row9 at turn64.\n\nBut in our current plan, we are at row8 at turn64. So we get to row9 at turn65.\n\nCan we get to row9 earlier?\n\nWe had to be at row4 at turn60. Then from row4 at turn60, we go up one row per turn: \n  turn60: row4 -> turn61: row5\n  turn61: row5 -> turn62: row6\n  turn62: row6 -> turn63: row7\n  turn63: row7 -> turn64: row8\n  turn64: row8 -> turn65: row9\n\nSo we need 5 turns from row4 to row9: so from turn60 to turn65.\n\nBut if we could get to row4 earlier than turn60? We cannot because we had to wait until turn60 for row4 to be safe.\n\nAlternatively, can we skip rows? No, we can only move one row per turn.\n\nOr can we take a different path? For example, go to row4 earlier and then wait there? But row4 at turn58 or 59 is not safe.\n\nOr go down? But that would take more turns.\n\nAnother idea: what if we go up to row5 earlier? But to get to row5, we have to go through row4. And row4 at the time we pass must be safe.\n\nAlternatively, can we go to row5 via a different route? No, we can only move vertically.\n\nSo we are constrained.\n\nWhat about the other rows? We have to check if there are any other cars that might hit us.\n\nIn our plan, we pass:\n  row1: turn55 -> safe (as computed)\n  row2: turn56 -> safe\n  row3: turn57,58,59 -> safe? \n      At row3: only one car: (-48, -59, right, 3). We are at row3 at turns57,58,59 (dt=3,4,5).\n      dt=3: [ -59+3*3, -48+3*3] = [-50, -39] -> safe.\n      dt=4: [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47, -36] -> safe.\n      dt=5: [-59+15, -48+15] = [-44, -33] -> safe.\n\n  row4: turn60 -> safe (as above)\n  row5: turn61 -> safe (as above)\n  row6: turn62 -> safe\n  row7: turn63 -> safe\n  row8: turn64 -> safe\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut can we avoid waiting so long? \n\nNote: the car on row4 that caused the problem is car2: (-12,-23,right,4). It is at x=0 at dt=3,4,5. We are going through row4 at dt=6 -> safe.\n\nBut what if we go through row4 at dt=0? We cannot because we start at row0 and need 4 moves to get to row4 -> earliest dt=4.\n\ndt=6 is the next safe time.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to go faster to row4? But we can't.\n\nAnother idea: what if we go to row5 at an earlier time by taking a different timing? But we have to go through row4.\n\nOr, we could go to row3 and then jump to row5? But we can only move one row at a time.\n\nSo we must wait.\n\nBut note: we are at row3 from turn57 to turn59. Instead of waiting, could we go up to row4 at a safe time and then immediately go to row5? But row4 is only safe at dt>=6. And row5 might have a car at the same time? \n\nWe checked row5 at turn61 (dt=7) and it was safe. But what about at dt=6? \n\nIf we were to go to row4 at turn60 (dt=6) and then immediately to row5 at turn61 (dt=7), which we did. But what if we try to go to row5 at turn60? We cannot: we are at row3 at turn59. We do U at turn59 to go to row4 at turn60. Then we cannot go to row5 at the same turn? We have to wait until turn60 to do the next action.\n\nSo we must spend one turn at row4.\n\nTherefore, the plan is minimal in terms of the waiting.\n\nBut is there a way to get to row9 earlier than turn65? \n\nSuppose we try to be at row4 at turn60 (as before) and then we go up as fast as possible: one row per turn. Then we are at row9 at turn65.\n\nWhat if we can avoid row5,6,7,8 at dangerous times? But we already checked they are safe at the times we pass.\n\nAlternatively, we might be able to use down moves to avoid a car at a particular turn? But that would take more turns.\n\nSo I think 12 is minimal.\n\nBut let me see the car on row5: car2 at (0,-11,right,12) at t1=54. \nAt time T=54+dt, the car spans: [ -11 + 12*dt, 0 + 12*dt ].\n\nWe are at row5 at turn61 (dt=7): [ -11+84, 84] = [73,84] -> safe.\n\nBut what about at dt=0? The car is at [-11,0] at dt=0. So if we are at row5 at turn54, we would be hit. But we are not.\n\nThe next time the car is at 0? \n  0 in [ -11+12*dt, 12*dt ] \n  => -11+12*dt <= 0 <= 12*dt \n  => 12*dt >= 0 -> always for dt>=0? \n  and 12*dt >= 11? -> dt>= ceil(11/12)=1? \n\nBut at dt=0: 0 is in the interval? yes, because the car spans from -11 to 0. So 0 is included.\n\nThen at dt=1: [ -11+12, 12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in.\ndt=2: [13,24] -> not.\n\nSo the car is at 0 only at dt=0? \n\nBut at dt=1, the car has moved to [1,12]? Then 0 is not covered.\n\nSo row5 is safe at dt>=1? \n\nBut we are going to be at row5 at turn61 (dt=7) which is safe.\n\nBut could we be at row5 earlier? For example, if we can get to row5 at turn55? That would require 5 moves? But we start at row0 at turn54. \n  turn54: U -> row1 at turn55\n  turn55: U -> row2 at turn56\n  turn56: U -> row3 at turn57\n  turn57: U -> row4 at turn58 -> but row4 at turn58 (dt=4) is not safe (car2 is at [-7,4] which covers 0).\n  so we cannot.\n\nAlternatively, we could get to row5 at turn59? \n  To be at row5 at turn59: we must be at row4 at turn58 -> which is not safe.\n\nOr turn60: row5? then we must be at row4 at turn59. But row4 at turn59: dt=5 -> car2: [ -23+4*5, -12+4*5] = [-23+20, -12+20] = [-3,8] -> 0 is in -> unsafe.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at row5 is turn61? Because we are at row4 at turn60 (safe) and then at turn60 we do U to go to row5 at turn61.\n\nTherefore, we cannot get to row5 earlier than turn61.\n\nSimilarly, the rest of the rows we get as fast as possible.\n\nSo the minimal H is 12.\n\nThe sequence of actions:\n\nTurn54: U\nTurn55: U\nTurn56: U\nTurn57: S\nTurn58: S\nTurn59: U\nTurn60: U\nTurn61: U\nTurn62: U\nTurn63: U\nTurn64: U\nTurn65: S\n\nBut wait, we do an action at turn65: S. And we are at row9 at the beginning of turn65? Then we do S to stay. \n\nBut the problem says: we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 = 54+12-1=65. And we are. So it's correct.\n\nBut note: the action at turn65 is not necessary for reaching the goal, but the sequence must have 12 actions.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid the last S if we could, but the problem requires exactly H actions.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\nTurn 57: S\nTurn 58: S\nTurn 59: U\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: U\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: S\n}\n\nBut wait, in the sequence, the last action is at turn65. And we have 12 actions.\n\nBut let me check the last state: after the action at turn65 (which is S), we are at row9 at turn66. But the problem only requires to be at row9 at turn65. So we are at row9 at turn65 (before the action) and then we do S and remain at row9 at turn66. \n\nBut the state at turn65 is row9, which is the goal. The action at turn65 doesn't change the row. \n\nSo it's acceptable.\n\nWe could also do U at turn65? But that would go to 10, which is invalid. Or D? to 8, which is not 9. So we must do S.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut note: we have 12 actions. Is there a sequence with H=11? \n\nIf H=11, then we want to be at row9 at turn54+11-1=64. So at turn64 we are at row9.\n\nTo be at row9 at turn64, we must have been at row8 at turn63 and then done U at turn63 to get to row9 at turn64.\n\nSo we need to be at row8 at turn63.\n\nHow to get to row8 at turn63? \n\nWe must be at row7 at turn62, row6 at turn61, row5 at turn60, row4 at turn59.\n\nBut row4 at turn59: dt=5 -> car2: [ -23+4*5, -12+4*5] = [-3,8] -> 0 in -> collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at row4 at turn59. So we cannot be at row8 at turn63.\n\nThus, H=12 is minimal.\n\nSo the answer is the 12-action sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from (0, 0) at turn 54 in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the following sequence of actions is required. The cars' movements are computed based on their initial state at turn 54 and their update rules for right-moving cars: \\(\\text{Span}(T) = [\\tau + s \\cdot (T - 54), h + s \\cdot (T - 54)]\\), where \\(T\\) is the turn. Collision occurs if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) at turn \\(T\\) and \\(0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nThe minimal sequence length \\(H = 12\\) ensures the player reaches (0, 9) at turn \\(54 + 12 - 1 = 65\\). The actions are designed to avoid collisions:\n- **Turns 54–56**: Move up to row 3 quickly. Rows 1–3 are safe at turns 55–57 (dt = 1–3) as cars do not cover \\(x=0\\).\n- **Turns 57–58**: Stay at row 3 to avoid row 4 at turn 58 (dt=4), where car 2 on row 4 spans \\([-7, 4]\\) (covers 0).\n- **Turn 59**: Move to row 4 at turn 60 (dt=6). Row 4 is safe at dt=6: car 2 spans \\([1, 12]\\) (0 not covered).\n- **Turns 60–64**: Move up one row per turn. Rows 5–8 are safe at turns 61–64 (dt=7–10) as cars do not cover \\(x=0\\).\n- **Turn 65**: Stay at row 9 (goal reached at turn 65, action S to remain).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 54: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 55: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 56: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 57: S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 58: S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 59: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 60: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 61: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 62: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 63: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 64: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 65: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 56, player is at (0,2). We need to reach (0,9) as quickly as possible without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8). The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) each turn, changing the y-coordinate by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, and must stay within y in [0,9].\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if the player is at y_T (which is the freeway row) and if at that turn T, any car on that freeway has its span including 0 (the x-coordinate of the player, which is always 0), then collision occurs.\n\nImportant note: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on row y_T during turn T. Therefore, when we move, we only check the car on the current row (the row we are leaving) at the current turn? Actually, note the condition: \n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nSo at turn T, the player is at (0, y_T). Therefore, we only care about the cars on the freeway row y_T at that exact turn T.\n\nAlso note: the cars are moving. The update for a car is:\n- Left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]   (but note: in the problem, for left-moving, the head and tail are given in a way that h is the front? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: at t1, the span is [h, τ] and then at T>t1, it becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. Similarly, right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note the representation: \nFor left-moving, the head is at a higher x? Actually, the problem states:\n- Left-moving: \"head is at h, tail is at τ\", and the span is [h, τ] -> but if the car is moving left, then the head (front) should be on the right? Actually, the update rule: \n  At T, the car's position is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. Since the car is moving left, as time increases, the positions decrease. So if at t1, the car is from h (rightmost) to τ (leftmost) and h > τ? But the problem writes [h, τ] and then subtracts, so we must have h and τ such that h is the starting head and τ the starting tail.\n\nBut note the example: \nFor a left-moving car, if at t1 the head is at 10 and tail at 5, then the car spans from 5 to 10? But the problem writes [h, τ] = [10,5] which is decreasing? That doesn't make sense for an interval. Actually, the problem says: \n  \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\"\n\nBut in mathematics, [a,b] is from a to b, so if a>b, it's empty? That can't be. I think the problem means the set of points from min(h,τ) to max(h,τ)? But the update rule then subtracts the same amount. Alternatively, the problem might have a convention that for left-moving, the head is the leading part and tail is trailing, so if moving left, head should be on the left? But then when updating, subtracting s*(T-t1) would move the entire car left. But the problem says: \n  Left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo if h and τ are numbers, then the interval is from min(h,τ) to max(h,τ)? But note: the problem also uses the same representation for right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)]. \n\nActually, looking at the right-moving case: \n  Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> meaning τ is the left end and h is the right end? Because then when we add s*(T-t1), the entire car moves right. So similarly, for left-moving: \n  Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> but if the car is moving left, then h should be the right end and τ the left end? But then [h, τ] would be [right, left] which is backwards. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be using the head as the leading part. So for left-moving, the head is the leftmost part? Then the tail is the rightmost? Then when moving left, the head decreases and the tail decreases. But then the interval [h, τ] would be from a smaller number to a larger? Because the tail is right of the head. \n\nTo avoid confusion, let's interpret the update: \nFor a left-moving car: \n  At t1: head at h, tail at τ -> the car covers [min(h,τ), max(h,τ)]? But the update rule subtracts the same amount, so the entire car moves left. \n\nBut the problem states the span as [h, τ] and then updates both by subtracting. So the relative positions of h and τ don't change? Then the car's length is |h - τ|? \n\nHowever, note the example data: \n  Freeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3) -> but for right-moving, the representation is [τ, h]? But the problem says for right-moving: Span(t1)=[τ, h] and then becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. \n\nIn this car: τ=-42, h=-53? That would make τ=-42 and h=-53, so [τ, h] = [-42, -53] which is backwards? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then the update. But in the data, we have (head, tail, direction, speed). For the right-moving car, the head should be the front (rightmost) and tail the rear (leftmost). So for a right-moving car, head (h) should be greater than tail (τ). \n\nBut look at the data: \n  Freeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3) -> head=-42, tail=-53? But then head is greater than tail? Actually, -42 > -53. So the head is at -42 and tail at -53. Then the car spans from tail to head: [-53, -42]. But the problem says for right-moving: Span(t1)=[τ, h] = [-53, -42]? But the problem writes [τ, h] meaning from τ to h? Then that would be [-53, -42] which is the correct interval? \n\nBut the problem states: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then updates to [τ+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)]. So at t1, the car is from τ to h, and then moves right by s*(T-t1). \n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, the head is the front (leftmost) and tail the rear (rightmost)? But in the data, there are no left-moving cars? All the cars in the given data are right-moving.\n\nSo let's focus: all cars in the problem are right-moving? \n\nLooking at the car state:\n\nAll freeways 1 to 8 have cars with direction \"right\". \n\nTherefore, we only need to handle right-moving cars. \n\nFor a right-moving car at turn t1: \n  head = h, tail = τ, with h > τ (since it's moving right, head is the rightmost, tail the leftmost). \n  The span at time T (>=t1) is: \n      [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (so y_T = k) and there is a car on freeway k such that 0 is in [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nWe are at turn t1 = 56.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k (from 1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, the time intervals (if any) when the car covers x=0.\n\nBut note: the player is at y=2 at turn 56. We need to move to y=9. The minimal number of moves is 7 (if we go up every turn). But we must avoid cars.\n\nWe have to check for each freeway we cross (if we go through them) whether at the turn we are on that freeway, there is a car covering x=0.\n\nWe can also wait (S) or even move down to avoid? But moving down would take more moves. We want minimal H.\n\nWe are starting at y=2 at turn 56. We can plan a sequence of actions for the next turns.\n\nLet T = 0 correspond to turn 56. Then at time T (relative to start), the absolute turn is 56+T.\n\nThe player's y-coordinate at time T (after T moves) is y_{56+T}. We start at T=0: y0 = 2.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions a_{56}, a_{57}, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nThe goal: y_{56+H-1} = 9, and H is minimal.\n\nWe must avoid: for each T>=0, at absolute turn 56+T, if the player is at row k (where k in {1,2,...,8}), then for every car on that row, we must have 0 not in the span of that car at turn 56+T.\n\nFor a car on freeway k at time t1=56: \n  span at turn 56+T: [τ + s*T, h + s*T]\n\nWe have the car data for each freeway.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head=-42, tail=-53, direction=right, speed=3 -> so at time T (from start), the car is at [ -53 + 3*T, -42 + 3*T ]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway1: [ -53 + 3*T, -42 + 3*T ]\n\nFreeway 3: same: [ -53 + 3*T, -42 + 3*T ]\n\nFreeway 4: three cars:\n  car1: (-40, -51, right, 4) -> [ -51 + 4*T, -40 + 4*T ]\n  car2: (-4, -15, right, 4) -> [ -15 + 4*T, -4 + 4*T ]\n  car3: (32, 21, right, 4) -> wait, head=32, tail=21? Then the car spans from 21 to 32? But that is [21,32] at T=0? But the problem says: for right-moving, the representation is (head, tail) and the span is [tail, head]? Actually, in the problem statement: \n      \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n  and for right-moving: \n      Span(t1) = [τ, h] \n  So if h=32, τ=21, then [21,32]. \n\nBut note: the car is moving right. At T=0, the car is at [21,32]. Then at time T, it becomes [21+4T, 32+4T]. \n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\" so yes.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars:\n  car1: (-24, -35, right, 12) -> [ -35+12T, -24+12T ]\n  car2: (24, 13, right, 12) -> [13+12T, 24+12T]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5: \n  car1: [-35+12T, -24+12T]\n  car2: [13+12T, 24+12T]\n\nFreeway 7: same as 5.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 5.\n\nNow, we are at T=0 (turn 56) at y=2. We are on freeway 2? Actually, the player is at (0,2) so freeway row 2. But note: the freeways are from y=1 to 8. So at T=0, we are on row 2. We must check row 2 at T=0.\n\nFor freeway 2 at T=0: \n  car: [ -53 + 3*0, -42 + 3*0 ] = [-53, -42] -> does 0 lie in [-53,-42]? No, because -42 < 0? Actually, -42 is negative, and the interval is from -53 to -42 (which is below 0). So no collision at T=0.\n\nBut we are at row 2, and the car is on row 2? Yes. But 0 is not in [-53,-42] -> safe.\n\nNow, we want to move up. But we must check the next turns.\n\nWe are going to simulate the next turns. We want to get to row 9 as fast as possible, so we would prefer to go up every turn. But we have to avoid collisions.\n\nLet me compute the car positions at future T for each freeway that we might step on.\n\nWe start at row 2. We need to go to row 9. We must pass rows 3,4,5,6,7,8. We might also stay on a row or even go down, but that would cost more.\n\nWe are going to try to go up as much as possible, but if at a future turn T, when we are on row k, there is a car on row k that has 0 in its span at that turn, then we must avoid being on that row at that turn.\n\nWe can wait (stay) or move down to shift the time we are on a row.\n\nWe are going to consider the minimal path: 7 moves (all U) would take 7 turns: \n  T0: y=2\n  T1: y=3\n  T2: y=4\n  T3: y=5\n  T4: y=6\n  T5: y=7\n  T6: y=8\n  T7: y=9 -> reached at T7 (so H=8? because from T0 to T7, we have 8 actions? But note: the sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and the last action leads to y=9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nActually, we start at T0 (turn56) at y=2. Then we take an action at T0 (turn56) to go to y at T1 (turn57). So we need to take actions until we are at y=9.\n\nThe state at T0 is given. Then we take action at T0, T1, ... until at the end of turn T (which is turn56+T) we are at y=9.\n\nSo if we do U at every step from T0 to T6, then:\n  T0: action U -> y=3 at T1 (turn57)\n  T1: action U -> y=4 at T2 (turn58)\n  ...\n  T6: action U -> y=9 at T7 (turn63)\n\nSo we take 7 actions (H=7) and the last action is at turn56+6 = turn62? \n\nWait, the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1: \n  a_{t1} = a_{56} (at T0)\n  a_{57} (at T1)\n  ...\n  a_{56+H-1} (at T_{H-1})\n\nAnd after the last action (at turn56+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nIn the above plan, we do:\n  T0 (turn56): U -> y=3 at turn57\n  T1 (turn57): U -> y=4 at turn58\n  T2 (turn58): U -> y=5 at turn59\n  T3 (turn59): U -> y=6 at turn60\n  T4 (turn60): U -> y=7 at turn61\n  T5 (turn61): U -> y=8 at turn62\n  T6 (turn62): U -> y=9 at turn63\n\nSo we are at y=9 at turn63, which is after 7 actions (from turn56 to turn62). So H=7.\n\nBut we must check for each of the turns (from turn56 to turn62) the row we are on and whether there is a collision.\n\nAt turn56 (T0): we are on row2 -> safe as computed.\n\nAt turn57 (T1): we are on row3. Check freeway3: \n  freeway3 has the same car as freeway1: [ -53+3*T, -42+3*T ] at T1: T=1 -> [ -53+3, -42+3] = [-50, -39] -> 0 not in this interval -> safe.\n\nAt turn58 (T2): we are on row4. Check freeway4: \n  freeway4 has three cars. We must check each one at T2 (since T=2 relative to start).\n\n  car1: [ -51 + 4*2, -40 + 4*2] = [-51+8, -40+8] = [-43, -32] -> 0 not in here.\n  car2: [ -15 + 4*2, -4+4*2] = [-15+8, -4+8] = [-7,4] -> 0 is in [-7,4]? Yes! \n      -7 <= 0 <= 4 -> collision.\n\nSo at turn58 (T2) if we are on row4, we collide with car2 on freeway4.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on row4 at turn58.\n\nWe must avoid that. How? We can delay our arrival at row4 or come earlier? \n\nWe are at row3 at turn57. Instead of going up at turn57 (to row4 at turn58), we could stay at row3 at turn58? Then at turn58 we are on row3. Then we can go to row4 at turn59.\n\nBut then the entire schedule shifts.\n\nAlternatively, we could go down? But that would be counterproductive.\n\nSo let's try: \n  T0 (turn56): U -> y=3 at turn57\n  T1 (turn57): S -> y=3 at turn58 (so we stay at row3 at turn58)\n  T2 (turn58): U -> y=4 at turn59 (so at turn59 we are at row4)\n\nNow, check row4 at turn59 (T3 relative to start):\n\n  For freeway4 at T3 (T=3):\n      car1: [-51+4*3, -40+4*3] = [-51+12, -40+12] = [-39,-28] -> safe.\n      car2: [-15+4*3, -4+12] = [-15+12, -4+12] = [-3,8] -> 0 is in [-3,8]? Yes! -> collision.\n\nStill collision at T3.\n\nWe need to avoid the car2 on freeway4 during the times when 0 is in its span.\n\nCar2: [ -15+4T, -4+4T ] \nWe have 0 in [ -15+4T, -4+4T ] \n  => -15+4T <= 0 <= -4+4T\n  => 4T <= 15  => T <= 15/4 = 3.75\n      and 0>=-4+4T => 4T<=4 => T<=1 -> wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nActually: \n  0 >= -15+4T  => 4T <= 15 => T <= 3.75\n  0 <= -4+4T   => 4T >= 4 => T>=1\n\nSo T in [1, 3.75]. Since T is integer, T=1,2,3.\n\nSo at T=1,2,3, the car2 on freeway4 covers 0.\n\nTherefore, we must not be on freeway4 at T=1,2,3 (absolute turns 57,58,59).\n\nWe are at T0 at row2. We want to be on row4 at a time T that is not in {1,2,3}. The earliest T we can be at row4 is T0+2? But T0+2 = T=2 -> not allowed. Then T0+3 = T=3 -> not allowed. Then T0+4 = T=4 -> allowed? \n\nBut we can also be at row4 earlier? We start at row2 at T0. We can go U at T0 to row3 at T1, then U at T1 to row4 at T2 -> T=2 -> not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, we can go U at T0 to row3 at T1, then S at T1 to row3 at T2, then U at T2 to row4 at T3 -> T=3 -> not allowed.\n\nThen we can do: \n  T0: U -> row3 at T1\n  T1: S -> row3 at T2\n  T2: S -> row3 at T3\n  T3: U -> row4 at T4 -> T=4 -> which is allowed.\n\nSo at T4, we are on row4. Check freeway4 at T=4:\n  car2: [-15+4*4, -4+16] = [-15+16, -4+16] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nNow, we must then continue to row5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut we have lost 2 extra turns (by staying at row3 for two extra turns). \n\nBut note: we have to check the other rows as well.\n\nNow, what about the higher rows? \n\nWe are now at row4 at T4. Then we plan to go up as much as possible.\n\nT4: U -> row5 at T5 (turn56+5=61)\nT5: U -> row6 at T6 (turn62)\nT6: U -> row7 at T7 (turn63)\nT7: U -> row8 at T8 (turn64)\nT8: U -> row9 at T9 (turn65)\n\nBut we must check each row at the time we are on it.\n\nCheck row5 at T5 (T=5):\n  freeway5: two cars.\n      car1: [-35+12*5, -24+12*5] = [-35+60, -24+60] = [25,36] -> safe (0 not in [25,36])\n      car2: [13+12*5, 24+60] = [13+60,24+60]=[73,84] -> safe.\n\nRow6 at T6 (T=6):\n  freeway6: same as freeway5? \n      car1: [-35+12*6, -24+72] = [-35+72, -24+72] = [37,48] -> safe.\n      car2: [13+72,24+72]=[85,96] -> safe.\n\nRow7 at T7 (T=7):\n  freeway7: \n      car1: [-35+12*7, -24+84] = [-35+84, -24+84] = [49,60] -> safe.\n      car2: [13+84,24+84]=[97,108] -> safe.\n\nRow8 at T8 (T=8):\n  freeway8:\n      car1: [-35+12*8, -24+96] = [-35+96, -24+96] = [61,72] -> safe.\n      car2: [13+96,24+96]=[109,120] -> safe.\n\nAnd then we reach row9 at T9, and row9 is not a freeway (since freeways are 1-8) so no collision.\n\nBut we have taken 9 moves? \n  T0: U -> row3\n  T1: S\n  T2: S\n  T3: U -> row4\n  T4: U -> row5\n  T5: U -> row6\n  T6: U -> row7\n  T7: U -> row8\n  T8: U -> row9\n\nThat's 9 moves. But is there a faster way?\n\nWe avoided row4 at T=1,2,3. The next safe time for row4 is T=4. \n\nBut what if we go faster to row3? We are already at row3 at T1. Then we wait until T4 to go to row4? That's three turns at row3 (T1, T2, T3). \n\nAlternatively, we could go to row4 at T=4 by a different path? We start at row2 at T0. We could go down to row1? But that would be worse.\n\nOr we could go up to row3 at T1, then down to row2 at T2? Then up again? But that would take even more moves.\n\nSo the above 9-move plan is one way. But can we do in less than 9?\n\nWe have to be at row4 at T>=4. The minimal time to get to row4 is 2 moves (if we go U,U) but that would be at T2 which is unsafe. The next safe time for row4 is T4. How to get to row4 at T4? \n\nWe start at row2 at T0. We must take at least 2 U moves to get to row4. But we can take extra moves. We can do:\n\nOption 1: \n  T0: U -> row3 at T1\n  T1: S -> row3 at T2\n  T2: S -> row3 at T3\n  T3: U -> row4 at T4   (4 moves to row4)\n\nOption 2: \n  T0: S -> row2 at T1\n  T1: U -> row3 at T2\n  T2: U -> row4 at T3   -> but T3 is unsafe? \n  Then we have to wait: so at T2 we are at row4? But we can't stay at row4 at T3? \n  Actually, at T2 we are at row4 (if we do U at T1 and U at T2) and then we must leave row4 at the next move? But we can stay? \n\nBut if we stay at row4 at T3, then we are on row4 at T3 -> unsafe. So we cannot stay. We must move away? \n\nWe could go to row5? Then we have to check row5 at T3.\n\nRow5 at T3 (absolute turn56+3=59): \n  freeway5: \n      car1: [-35+12*3, -24+36] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12]? Actually, 0<1 -> safe? \n      car2: [13+36,24+36]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\nSo row5 at T3 is safe.\n\nSo we can do:\n  T0: U -> row3 at T1 (turn57)\n  T1: U -> row4 at T2 (turn58) -> but row4 at T2 is unsafe (we saw car2 covers 0 at T2) -> so we cannot be at row4 at T2.\n\nBut if we go directly from row3 to row5? We cannot. We must go through row4. So we have to step on row4 at some point.\n\nThe move: at T1 (at row3) we do U: that moves us to row4 at T2. Then at T2 we do U again: that moves us to row5 at T3. \n\nBut when we are at row4 at T2: we are on row4 during turn58 (T2) -> that's unsafe. \n\nSo we collide at T2.\n\nWe cannot avoid stepping on row4? And we must not step on row4 at T=1,2,3. So the earliest we can be at row4 is T4.\n\nTherefore, we must wait until T4 to be at row4.\n\nNow, what about the other rows? We have to check the entire path.\n\nIn the 9-move plan we had:\n\n  T0: U (to row3) -> safe (row2 at T0: safe, row3 at T1: safe? we checked row3 at T1: safe? \n        row3: freeway3 at T1: [ -53+3*1, -42+3] = [-50,-39] -> safe.\n\n  T1: S (stay at row3) -> at T2 (turn58) we are at row3: \n        row3: freeway3 at T2: [ -53+3*2, -42+6] = [-53+6, -42+6] = [-47,-36] -> safe.\n\n  T2: S (stay at row3) -> at T3 (turn59) we are at row3:\n        row3: freeway3 at T3: [ -53+9, -42+9] = [-44,-33] -> safe.\n\n  T3: U (to row4) -> at T4 (turn60) we are at row4: safe (as above).\n\n  Then T4: U (to row5) -> at T5 (turn61) row5: safe (as above).\n\n  T5: U (to row6) -> at T6 (turn62) row6: safe.\n\n  T6: U (to row7) -> at T7 (turn63) row7: safe.\n\n  T7: U (to row8) -> at T8 (turn64) row8: safe.\n\n  T8: U (to row9) -> at T9 (turn65) we are at row9 -> goal.\n\nTotal 9 moves.\n\nBut we want minimal H. Is there a way to do in less than 9?\n\nWe must be at row4 at T>=4. The minimal time to row4 is 2 moves, but that lands at T2 which is unsafe. Then we must wait until T4. So we are forced to take at least 4 moves to get to row4? \n\nBut we can be at row4 at T4 by taking 2 U moves and 2 S moves? That's 4 actions. Then we need 5 more moves to go from row4 to row9? That's 9 total.\n\nAlternatively, we could go to row5 at T4? \n\nFrom row2: \n  T0: U -> row3 at T1\n  T1: U -> row4 at T2 -> unsafe, so we avoid by not doing that.\n\n  Instead, we do:\n  T0: U -> row3 at T1\n  T1: S -> row3 at T2\n  T2: S -> row3 at T3\n  T3: U -> row4 at T4\n  T4: U -> row5 at T5\n\nBut that's 5 moves to get to row5. Then we need 4 more to row9: total 9.\n\nBut what if we try to go to row5 at T4? \n\nWe start at row2 at T0.\n  T0: U -> row3 at T1\n  T1: U -> row4 at T2 (unsafe) -> skip.\n\n  Alternatively, we could do:\n  T0: U -> row3 at T1\n  T1: U -> row4 at T2 -> but unsafe, so we cannot do that.\n\n  Or: \n  T0: S -> row2 at T1\n  T1: U -> row3 at T2\n  T2: U -> row4 at T3 -> unsafe (T3 is in [1,3])\n  T3: then we have to leave? But we are at row4 at T3 -> unsafe.\n\n  Or:\n  T0: D -> row1 at T1 -> then we are at row1 (freeway1) at T1: \n        row1 at T1: freeway1 car: [ -53+3*1, -42+3] = [-50,-39] -> safe.\n  T1: U -> row2 at T2 -> row2 at T2: freeway2 car: [ -53+3*2, -42+6] = [-47,-36] -> safe.\n  T2: U -> row3 at T3 -> row3 at T3: freeway3: [ -53+9, -42+9] = [-44,-33] -> safe.\n  T3: U -> row4 at T4 -> safe (as before).\n\nSo this also takes 4 moves to row4 at T4: \n  T0: D -> row1\n  T1: U -> row2\n  T2: U -> row3\n  T3: U -> row4\n\nBut then we are at row4 at T4. Then we still need 5 more to row9: total 9 moves.\n\nSo it seems 9 is the minimal.\n\nBut wait: what if we skip row4? We cannot skip because we must traverse each row.\n\nAlternatively, we might be able to avoid row4 by going through it very quickly? But the collision condition is at the turn we are on the row. When we are at row4 at a particular turn, we are exposed for the entire turn.\n\nBut note: we can also consider that we are at row4 for only one turn? But that turn must be safe.\n\nWe have to have a safe turn for row4. The next safe time for row4 is T4. \n\nBut what about T=0? We start at row2. We are not at row4 at T0.\n\nT=4 is the next safe time. Then T=5? But that would be even later.\n\nSo we must be at row4 at T4 at the earliest.\n\nNow, is there a way to get to row9 in fewer than 9 moves? \n\nThe minimal moves without obstacles is 7. We are delayed by 2 moves (because we have to wait 2 extra turns at row3). So 7+2=9.\n\nBut let me see if we can save a move by going faster on the upper rows? \n\nFor example, once we are at row4 at T4, we go up every turn: \n  T4: row4 -> T5: row5 -> T6: row6 -> T7: row7 -> T8: row8 -> T9: row9 -> 5 moves from row4 to row9.\n\nTotal: 4 moves (to row4) + 5 moves = 9.\n\nBut what if we are at row4 at T4, and then we do U at T4 to row5 at T5, but then we check row5 at T5: safe. Then U at T5 to row6 at T6: safe. Then U at T6 to row7 at T7: safe. Then U at T7 to row8 at T8: safe. Then U at T8 to row9 at T9: safe.\n\nBut that's 5 moves. \n\nAlternatively, can we do double moves? No, the moves are one row per step.\n\nSo 9 moves seems necessary.\n\nBut let me check if we can be at row4 at T4 and then go up without any further delays. We have to check the upper rows for the times we pass.\n\nWe have already checked: \n  row5 at T5: safe\n  row6 at T6: safe\n  row7 at T7: safe\n  row8 at T8: safe\n\nBut what about row5 at T5? We did T5: T=5 -> freeway5: \n  car1: [-35+12*5, -24+60] = [25,36] -> safe\n  car2: [13+60,24+60]=[73,84] -> safe\n\nSimilarly, row6 at T6: T=6 -> freeway6: \n  car1: [-35+12*6, -24+72]=[37,48] -> safe\n  car2: [13+72,24+72]=[85,96] -> safe\n\nBut wait, freeway5 and freeway6 have the same car configurations? But they are different rows. The cars on freeway5 are at row5, and we are checking row5 at T5: safe. Similarly for row6.\n\nNow, what about row3? We spent three turns at row3: T1, T2, T3. But we already checked row3 at T1, T2, T3: safe.\n\nSo the 9-move plan is safe.\n\nBut is there a plan with 8 moves? \n\nSuppose we try to get to row9 in 8 moves. That would require 6 net up moves (from row2 to row9: 7 levels, so 6 moves? Actually: \n  row2 -> row3: +1\n  row3 -> row4: +1\n  row4 -> row5: +1\n  row5 -> row6: +1\n  row6 -> row7: +1\n  row7 -> row8: +1\n  row8 -> row9: +1 -> total 7 up moves.\n\nBut we start at row2. To get to row9, we need 7 up moves. So minimal moves is 7. But we have to avoid the obstacle on row4 at T=1,2,3. \n\nIn 7 moves, we would be at row4 at T2 (if we do U at T0 and U at T1). But T2 is unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, we must insert delays. The minimal delay is 2 extra moves (so total 9) to wait until T4 to be at row4.\n\nIf we try 8 moves: then we have 7 up moves and 1 non-up move (either S or D). \n\nBut we have to be at row4 at T>=4. \n\nWe start at row2 at T0.\n\nWe have to take 2 U moves to get to row4. \n\nThe earliest we can be at row4 is T2 (if we do U at T0 and U at T1). But that's unsafe.\n\nThe next chance is T3: but to be at row4 at T3, we must have taken two U moves and one other move. For example:\n\n  Option A:\n      T0: U -> row3 at T1\n      T1: U -> row4 at T2 -> unsafe, so we cannot do that.\n\n  Option B:\n      T0: U -> row3 at T1\n      T1: S -> row3 at T2\n      T2: U -> row4 at T3 -> unsafe (T3 is unsafe).\n\n  Option C:\n      T0: S -> row2 at T1\n      T1: U -> row3 at T2\n      T2: U -> row4 at T3 -> unsafe.\n\n  Option D:\n      T0: D -> row1 at T1\n      T1: U -> row2 at T2\n      T2: U -> row3 at T3\n      T3: U -> row4 at T4 -> safe.\n\nBut then from row4 at T4, we have to do 5 U moves to get to row9 at T9? But we are at T3: we are at row4 at T4? Then we do:\n      T4: U -> row5 at T5\n      T5: U -> row6 at T6\n      T6: U -> row7 at T7\n      T7: U -> row8 at T8\n      T8: U -> row9 at T9\n\nSo that's 9 moves (T0 to T8: 9 actions).\n\nBut we are trying for 8 moves? We are at T8: that is the 9th state? \n\nActually, the moves are taken at T0 to T7 (8 moves) and then at T8 we are at row9? \n\nBut in the above:\n  T0: D (move0)\n  T1: U (move1)\n  T2: U (move2)\n  T3: U (move3) -> row4 at T4? Actually, after move3 (at T3) we are at row4 at T4? \n\nLet me clarify:\n\nAt the start of turn56 (T0): we are at row2.\nAfter action at T0 (turn56): we move to a new row at the start of turn57 (T1).\n\nSo:\n  T0 (turn56): action -> at turn57 (T1) we are at new row.\n  T1 (turn57): action -> at turn58 (T2) we are at next row.\n\nIn the above Option D:\n  T0 (turn56): D -> at T1 (turn57): row1\n  T1 (turn57): U -> at T2 (turn58): row2\n  T2 (turn58): U -> at T3 (turn59): row3\n  T3 (turn59): U -> at T4 (turn60): row4  -> safe (T4=4)\n\nThen:\n  T4 (turn60): U -> at T5 (turn61): row5\n  T5 (turn61): U -> at T6 (turn62): row6\n  T6 (turn62): U -> at T7 (turn63): row7\n  T7 (turn63): U -> at T8 (turn64): row8\n  T8 (turn64): U -> at T9 (turn65): row9\n\nBut we haven't reached row9 until after 9 actions? And the last action is at turn64 (which is t1+8? since t1=56, so 56+8=64) and then we are at row9 at turn65. But we need to be at row9 at the turn after the last action. \n\nThe problem: after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9). So we must be at row9 at the end of the last action.\n\nIn the above, if we do 9 actions, then at the end of the 9th action (at turn56+8=64) we are at row9? \n\nIn the timeline:\n  After 0 actions: turn56, row2.\n  After 1 action: turn57, row1 (if first action D)\n  After 2 actions: turn58, row2\n  After 3 actions: turn59, row3\n  After 4 actions: turn60, row4\n  After 5 actions: turn61, row5\n  After 6 actions: turn62, row6\n  After 7 actions: turn63, row7\n  After 8 actions: turn64, row8\n  After 9 actions: turn65, row9 -> then we stop. The last action (9th) is at turn64? \n\nYes: \n  action0 (a56) at turn56 -> state at turn57\n  action1 (a57) at turn57 -> state at turn58\n  ...\n  action8 (a64) at turn64 -> state at turn65: row9.\n\nSo H=9.\n\nBut we want minimal. And we cannot do in 8? \n\nSuppose we try to use one S move and 7 U moves? That would be 8 moves? \n\nBut we have to avoid row4 at T=1,2,3.\n\nWe start at row2 at T0.\n\nWe must be at row4 at T>=4.\n\nWith 8 moves, we have 7 U and 1 S. \n\nWe have to distribute the S somewhere.\n\nCase 1: S at row3 at some turn.\n\nWe have to get to row3: \n  T0: U -> row3 at T1.\n\nThen we can do S at T1: then we are at row3 at T2.\n\nThen T2: U -> row4 at T3 -> unsafe.\n\nThen we have to do U at T2 to row4 at T3 -> unsafe.\n\nCase 2: S at row2.\n\n  T0: S -> row2 at T1.\n  T1: U -> row3 at T2.\n  T2: U -> row4 at T3 -> unsafe.\n\nCase 3: S at row4? But we cannot stay at row4 at an unsafe time.\n\nCase 4: S at row1? \n\n  T0: D -> row1 at T1.\n  T1: S -> row1 at T2. -> then we are at row1 at T2: check freeway1 at T2: [ -53+3*2, -42+6] = [-47,-36] -> safe.\n  Then T2: U -> row2 at T3: freeway2 at T3: [ -53+3*3, -42+9] = [-44,-33] -> safe.\n  T3: U -> row3 at T4: freeway3 at T4: [ -53+3*4, -42+12] = [-41,-30] -> safe.\n  T4: U -> row4 at T5: freeway4 at T5: \n        car2: [-15+4*5, -4+20] = [-15+20, -4+20] = [5,16] -> safe.\n  Then T5: U -> row5 at T6: safe (as before)\n  T6: U -> row6 at T7: safe\n  T7: U -> row7 at T8: safe\n  T8: U -> row8 at T9: safe -> but we are not at row9.\n\nWe are at row8 at T9. We need one more U to row9 at T10. That would be 9 moves.\n\nWe are missing the last move to row9.\n\nSo we have 8 moves: but we are at row8 at T9? Then we need a 9th move.\n\nTherefore, we cannot reach row9 in 8 moves.\n\nThus, minimal H is 9.\n\nNow, we have to output the sequence.\n\nWe have two valid sequences? \n\nOption A (with three S at row3? Actually we did two S at row3 in the first plan? Let me recall:\n\nFirst plan:\n  T0: U -> row3 at T1\n  T1: S -> row3 at T2\n  T2: S -> row3 at T3\n  T3: U -> row4 at T4\n  T4: U -> row5 at T5\n  T5: U -> row6 at T6\n  T6: U -> row7 at T7\n  T7: U -> row8 at T8\n  T8: U -> row9 at T9\n\nBut that's 9 moves: actions at T0 to T8.\n\nBut at T1: we did S -> that's at turn57: we are at row3 at turn58? \nWait, let's map:\n\nTurn56 (T0): action U -> at turn57: row3\nTurn57 (T1): action S -> at turn58: row3\nTurn58 (T2): action S -> at turn59: row3\nTurn59 (T3): action U -> at turn60: row4\nTurn60 (T4): U -> turn61: row5\nTurn61 (T5): U -> turn62: row6\nTurn62 (T6): U -> turn63: row7\nTurn63 (T7): U -> turn64: row8\nTurn64 (T8): U -> turn65: row9\n\nSo the actions are:\n  Turn56: U\n  Turn57: S\n  Turn58: S\n  Turn59: U\n  Turn60: U\n  Turn61: U\n  Turn62: U\n  Turn63: U\n  Turn64: U\n\nThat's 9 actions.\n\nBut we can also do the other plan with a down move:\n\n  Turn56: D\n  Turn57: U\n  Turn58: U\n  Turn59: U\n  Turn60: U\n  Turn61: U\n  Turn62: U\n  Turn63: U\n  Turn64: U\n\nBut that would be:\n\n  T0: D -> at turn57: row1\n  T1: U -> at turn58: row2\n  T2: U -> at turn59: row3\n  T3: U -> at turn60: row4 (safe)\n  T4: U -> at turn61: row5\n  T5: U -> at turn62: row6\n  T6: U -> at turn63: row7\n  T7: U -> at turn64: row8\n  T8: U -> at turn65: row9\n\nBut we need 9 actions. The last action is at turn64.\n\nBut note: in this plan, we did a down move at the beginning. Is that necessary? Actually, we could have done:\n\n  Turn56: U -> row3 at turn57\n  Turn57: D? -> then at turn58: row2? \n  Then we have to go up again.\n\nBut that would be more moves? \n\nActually, the down move at the beginning is an alternative. But both are 9 moves.\n\nWe choose one that is safe. The first plan (with two S at row3) is simpler? \n\nBut let me check the down move plan for safety:\n\nAt turn56: we are at row2 at T0: safe (as before)\nAfter action D at turn56: at turn57 (T1) we are at row1.\n  Check row1 at turn57 (T1): freeway1: [ -53+3*1, -42+3] = [-50,-39] -> safe.\n\nAt turn57: action U -> at turn58 (T2) row2.\n  Check row2 at turn58: freeway2: [ -53+3*2, -42+6] = [-47,-36] -> safe.\n\nAt turn58: action U -> at turn59 (T3) row3.\n  Check row3 at turn59: freeway3: [ -53+3*3, -42+9] = [-44,-33] -> safe.\n\nAt turn59: action U -> at turn60 (T4) row4: safe (as computed).\n\nThen the rest: safe.\n\nSo both plans are safe.\n\nWe can choose either. \n\nBut the problem asks for minimal H, which is 9 in both.\n\nWe can choose the one without down moves? \n\nFirst plan: \n  Turn56: U\n  Turn57: S\n  Turn58: S\n  Turn59: U\n  Turn60: U\n  Turn61: U\n  Turn62: U\n  Turn63: U\n  Turn64: U\n\nSecond plan:\n  Turn56: D\n  Turn57: U\n  Turn58: U\n  Turn59: U\n  Turn60: U\n  Turn61: U\n  Turn62: U\n  Turn63: U\n  Turn64: U\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nBut note: the second plan does an extra down move? Actually, it does one down and then the rest up. The first plan does two stays. \n\nBoth are acceptable.\n\nI'll choose the first plan to avoid going down.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 56: U\nTurn 57: S\nTurn 58: S\nTurn 59: U\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: U\nTurn 64: U\n\nBut wait: after the last action (turn64: U), we are at row9 at turn65. And that's the goal.\n\nBut we need to make sure that at turn64 we are at row8? Then we do U to row9.\n\nIn the first plan, at turn64 we are at row8? How?\n\nLet's track:\n\n  Start: turn56: row2\n  Turn56: U -> at turn57: row3\n  Turn57: S -> at turn58: row3\n  Turn58: S -> at turn59: row3\n  Turn59: U -> at turn60: row4\n  Turn60: U -> at turn61: row5\n  Turn61: U -> at turn62: row6\n  Turn62: U -> at turn63: row7\n  Turn63: U -> at turn64: row8\n  Turn64: U -> at turn65: row9\n\nYes.\n\nNow, check if at any turn we are on a freeway and the car covers 0:\n\nturn56: row2 -> freeway2: safe (as before)\nturn57: row3 -> freeway3: at T1: safe\nturn58: row3 -> freeway3: at T2: safe\nturn59: row3 -> freeway3: at T3: safe\nturn60: row4 -> freeway4: at T4: \n        car2: [-15+4*4, -4+16] = [1,12] -> safe\nturn61: row5: freeway5: at T5: safe\nturn62: row6: freeway6: at T6: safe\nturn63: row7: freeway7: at T7: safe\nturn64: row8: freeway8: at T8: safe\n\nAnd turn65: row9 -> not a freeway.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the sequence above.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", which we determined as 9.\n\nSo output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 56: U\nTurn 57: S\nTurn 58: S\nTurn 59: U\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: U\nTurn 64: U\n}\n\nBut wait: the last action is at turn64? And we start at turn56. So the actions are from turn56 to turn64? That's 9 actions. And at turn65 we are at row9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and H is the number of actions.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 58, and the player is at (0,3). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at turn T.\n\nNote: The player updates position at the end of the turn. So at turn T, the player is at y_T and then chooses an action to go to y_{T+1}. When we say \"at turn T\", the player is at y_T.\n\nThe car update rules:\n- For a car at turn t1 (current turn) with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s.\n- At turn T (>= t1), the car's span becomes:\n    - If left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]   (and note: since left-moving, the head is the rightmost? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: initial span [h, tau] and then it moves left so both decrease. But note: in the example for left-moving, the head is the larger number? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: initial span [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. And for right-moving: initial span [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So in the right-moving case, the initial span is given as (head, tail) = (h, tau) but the span is written as [tau, h] meaning that tau is the left end and h is the right end? Actually, the problem states for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut looking at the given data:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3) -> so for right-moving, the span at t1 (turn 58) is [tau, h] = [-47, -36]? But the problem says the car state is given as (head h, tail tau, direction, speed). So for right-moving, the head is the front? Then the span should be [tail, head] = [tau, h]. So in this case, at turn 58: \n    freeway 1: car1: tail = -47, head = -36 -> span [-47, -36] at turn 58.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: three cars: \n    (-32, -43, right, 4) -> span [-43, -32] at turn 58.\n    (4, -7, right, 4) -> span [-7, 4] at turn 58.\n    (40, 29, right, 4) -> wait, 40 and 29? Then span [29,40] at turn 58? But note: the problem says (head, tail) and for right-moving, the head is the rightmost? Then tail should be less than head. Here, 29 < 40, so that's okay: [29,40].\n\nBut wait: the second car: (4, -7) -> tail=-7, head=4 -> so the car covers from -7 to 4? That is 12 units long? But note: the length of the car is |head - tail|? Actually, the span is inclusive? So if the car is at positions from -7 to 4, that's 12 units? But the speed is 4, so it moves right.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: (0, -11, right, 12) -> span [-11,0] at turn 58. And (48,37,right,12) -> [37,48] at turn 58.\n\nBut note: at turn 58, the player is at (0,3). We are going to simulate from turn 58.\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and if the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that turn T.\n\nImportant: the player is at (0, y_T) at turn T. So we care about the cars on row y_T at turn T.\n\nWe need to avoid being at a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T if any car on that freeway at turn T has 0 in its span.\n\nNote: the player is not on a freeway when at y=0 or y=9. So at the start, the player is at y=3 (freeway 3) at turn 58. We must check freeway 3 at turn 58.\n\nLet me compute the car positions on each freeway at turn 58 (current turn) and then at future turns.\n\nWe'll compute the span for each car at any turn T (>=58) as:\n    T_rel = T - 58\n    For a right-moving car: [tau + s * T_rel, h + s * T_rel]\n    For a left-moving car: [h - s * T_rel, tau - s * T_rel]\n\nBut note: the given state is at turn 58, so T_rel=0.\n\nNow, we need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) to go from y=3 to y=9 in minimal H (turns) without colliding.\n\nThe actions change the y-coordinate by +1 (U), -1 (D), or 0 (S). The player cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nGoal: y = 9.\n\nWe are at turn 58: y_58 = 3.\n\nWe need to find the minimal H and the actions from turn 58 to turn 58+H-1 such that y_{58+H-1} = 9.\n\nNote: H is the number of turns. So if we start at turn 58 and do H actions, then at the end of the H actions we are at turn 58+H, and the last action is at turn 58+H-1? Actually, the sequence is from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1=58. So:\n\n    t = 0 (relative) corresponds to turn 58: we do action a_{58} and then at turn 59 we are at y_59 = y_58 + delta.\n    Then at t=1 (relative) we do a_{59} and so on.\n\nBut note: the state at turn 58 is given, and we start by choosing an action at turn 58.\n\nWe want to reach (0,9) at the last action. So if we do H actions, then the last action is at turn 58+H-1, and after that action we are at turn 58+H with y_{58+H} = 9? But the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nWait: the index: \n    At turn t1 (58) we are at y_{t1} = 3.\n    Then we do action a_{t1} (a_58) and then we are at y_{t1+1} (y_59) = 3 + delta(a_58).\n    Then we do a_{t1+1} (a_59) and then at turn t1+2 (60) we are at y_60 = y_59 + delta(a_59).\n    ...\n    After H actions (from t=0 to t=H-1), we have done H actions and the last action is at turn t1+H-1 (58+H-1). Then the position at turn t1+H-1 is the position after the (H-1)-th action? Actually, the position is updated after the action. So:\n\n        y_{t1} is given.\n        After a_{t1} (at the end of turn t1) we have y_{t1+1}.\n        After a_{t1+1} (at the end of turn t1+1) we have y_{t1+2}.\n        ...\n        After a_{t1+H-1} (at the end of turn t1+H-1) we have y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the problem says: we require y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\nWait, the problem states: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" to reach (0,9). Then it says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nBut note: the action a_{t1+t} is taken at turn t1+t, and then we get y_{t1+t+1}. So:\n\n    At the start of turn t1: we are at y_{t1}.\n    We do a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1 we are at y_{t1+1}.\n    We do a_{t1+1} -> then at turn t1+2 we are at y_{t1+2}.\n    ...\n    We do a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1 -> then at turn t1+H we are at y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the requirement is y_{t1+H-1} = 9? That would be the position at the beginning of the last action? Or after the last action?\n\nClarification: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" and \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". So they want the position at the end of the sequence to be 9, but note that the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1 and then the position becomes y_{t1+H}. However, the problem states the requirement as y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nThis seems inconsistent. Let me reread:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), ... such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nBut note: the player position is updated after the action. So at the end of the sequence of H actions (which are taken at turns t1 to t1+H-1), the player's position at turn t1+H (after the last action) is y_{t1+H}. However, the problem says we require y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nWait, that would mean that at the turn when we take the last action (turn t1+H-1), the player is already at 9? But then the action at that turn doesn't change the position? Or perhaps we are required to be at 9 at the beginning of that turn? \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". And the state at turn t1+H-1: the player is at y_{t1+H-1}. Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} and then we go to y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9). So if we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, then we are done? And we don't need to take an action that turn? \n\nBut the sequence includes H actions. So if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to take any action? But the sequence has H actions and the last action is at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me look at the answer format: it says to write actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... until the last action.\n\nBut the requirement is y_{t1+H-1}=9. So if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to move? We can choose action S (stay) at that turn? Or we might have reached 9 at an earlier turn and then we are done? \n\nActually, the problem says: we must have y_{t1+H-1}=9. And the sequence has H actions. The actions are taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nSo:\n\n    At turn t1: we are at y_{t1}=3. Then we take action a_{t1} and then we are at y_{t1+1}.\n    ...\n    At turn t1+H-2: we are at y_{t1+H-2}. Then we take action a_{t1+H-2} and go to y_{t1+H-1}.\n    Then at turn t1+H-1: we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9. Then we take action a_{t1+H-1}? But then we move to y_{t1+H} = 9 + delta. But we want to be at 9 at the end? \n\nWait, the problem says: after the sequence of H actions, we should be at (0,9). But note that the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1 and then we get y_{t1+H}. So to be at 9 at the end of the sequence, we must have y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem states: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis seems like a discrepancy. I think there might be a misunderstanding. Let me read carefully:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\nBut note: the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1, so the actions are at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThe player position at the start of turn t1 is given: (0,3).\n\nAfter action a_{t1} (at turn t1), we get y_{t1+1}.\nAfter action a_{t1+1} (at turn t1+1), we get y_{t1+2}.\n...\nAfter action a_{t1+H-1} (at turn t1+H-1), we get y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? That would be the position at the start of turn t1+H-1? Then after the action at turn t1+H-1, we move to y_{t1+H}. But we want to be at 9 at the end? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that we are at 9 at the end of the entire sequence? Then it should be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nLet me check the problem statement again: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\nThis implies that at the turn t1+H-1 (the turn when we take the last action) the player is already at 9? But then why take the last action? \n\nAnother interpretation: the sequence of actions is taken from t=0 to H-1, and the position after the entire sequence is y_{t1+H}. But the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nThis is confusing. I will assume that the problem means we want the player to be at (0,9) at the end of the sequence of actions, i.e., at turn t1+H. Therefore, we require y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut then why does it say y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nLooking at the problem: \"reach (0,9)\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". Maybe it's a typo? \n\nAlternatively, note that the turn index: the actions are taken at turns t1 to t1+H-1, and the position at turn t1+H-1 is the position at the start of that turn? But the problem states the position after the update. \n\nGiven the confusion, I will rely on the example: we start at turn t1 and we do H actions. The last action is at turn t1+H-1 and the next state is turn t1+H. The problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", which would be the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? But the state is updated after the action of the previous turn.\n\nI think the problem means that after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at y_{t1+H}=9? But that would be inconsistent with the notation.\n\nLet me look at the update rule: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\", so the position at time t+1 is determined by the action at time t.\n\nSo at time t1, we start at y_{t1}=3.\nAfter action a_{t1}, we get y_{t1+1}.\n...\nAfter action a_{t1+H-1}, we get y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be indexing the position by the turn at which the action is taken. But the update rule clearly states: y_{t+1} is the position after the action at turn t.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem statement. However, the answer format requires:\n\n    Turn t1: a_{t1}\n    Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n    ...\n    Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd then the position after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is y_{t1+H}. And we want that to be 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will assume that the goal is to have the player at y=9 at the end of the sequence, i.e., at turn t1+H. So we require y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nMoreover, note that we start at y=3 and we need to go up to 9: that's 6 steps up. So without any obstacles, we could do 6 U actions and be at 9 at turn 58+6 = 64. But then the sequence would be from turn 58 to turn 63 (6 actions) and then at turn 64 we are at 9.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, so H=6 actions: \n    turn58: U\n    turn59: U\n    turn60: U\n    turn61: U\n    turn62: U\n    turn63: U\nand then at turn64: y=9.\n\nBut the problem requires y_{t1+H-1}=y_{58+5}=y_{63}=8? and then after the last U we go to 9. \n\nBut the problem states: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", which in this case would be y_{63}=9? But we are at 8 at turn63 (after 5 U's) and then we do the 6th U to go to 9 at turn64. So y_{63}=8, not 9.\n\nThis suggests that the problem means that after the last action we are at 9, and the last action is at turn t1+H-1, so we require y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nAnd the problem's requirement \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\" might be a typo and should be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nI will proceed under this assumption: we require y_{58+H}=9.\n\nWe start at turn58 at y=3, and we want to be at y=9 at turn58+H.\n\nThe minimal H without obstacles is 6. But we have cars that might block our path.\n\nWe need to simulate the car positions at each future turn and check for collisions.\n\nLet's list the cars per freeway at turn58:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: right-moving, tail=-47, head=-36, speed=3.\n    At turn58: span = [-47, -36]\n    At turn T: span = [-47 + 3*(T-58), -36 + 3*(T-58)]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway1: [-47 + 3*(T-58), -36 + 3*(T-58)]\n\nFreeway 3: same: [-47 + 3*(T-58), -36 + 3*(T-58)]\n\nFreeway 4: three cars:\n    car1: tail=-43, head=-32, speed=4 -> span at T: [-43+4*(T-58), -32+4*(T-58)]\n    car2: tail=-7, head=4, speed=4 -> [-7+4*(T-58), 4+4*(T-58)]\n    car3: tail=29, head=40, speed=4 -> [29+4*(T-58), 40+4*(T-58)]\n\nFreeway 5: two cars:\n    car1: tail=-11, head=0, speed=12 -> [-11+12*(T-58), 0+12*(T-58)]\n    car2: tail=37, head=48, speed=12 -> [37+12*(T-58), 48+12*(T-58)]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway5: two cars with the same parameters.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway5.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway5.\n\nWe need to check for each freeway y (from 1 to 8) and for each turn T>=58, whether the player is on that freeway (i.e., y_T = y) and whether 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNote: if the player is at y=0 or y=9, no collision.\n\nWe start at turn58 at y=3. We are on freeway3.\n\nAt turn58, freeway3: car span = [-47+0, -36+0] = [-47,-36] -> 0 is not in this span? (0 is greater than -36) -> so no collision at turn58.\n\nWe can try going straight up: U for 6 turns.\n\nLet's check the path:\n\n    Turn58: at y=3 -> safe (as above).\n        Action: U -> then at turn59: y=4.\n\n    Turn59: at y=4 -> freeway4.\n        Check freeway4 at turn59: T_rel=1.\n        car1: [-43+4*1, -32+4*1] = [-39, -28] -> 0 not in.\n        car2: [-7+4, 4+4] = [-3,8] -> 0 is in [-3,8]? Yes, 0 is in [-3,8]. \n        So collision! We cannot be at freeway4 at turn59.\n\nSo we cannot go up at turn58 to y=4 at turn59.\n\nWe must avoid freeway4 at turn59.\n\nOptions: \n    - We could wait at y=3 for one turn (action S) and then go up later.\n    - Or we could go down? But we are at y=3, if we go down to y=2, then at turn59 we are at freeway2.\n\nCheck freeway2 at turn59: T_rel=1.\n    car: [-47+3*1, -36+3*1] = [-44, -33] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nThen from y=2 we can go up.\n\nBut we need to get to y=9 eventually. Going down might be detour.\n\nAlternatively, we could wait at y=3 for one turn: do S at turn58, then at turn59 we are still at y=3. Then at turn59, we can try to go up.\n\nAt turn59: at y=3 -> freeway3.\n    Check freeway3 at turn59: T_rel=1 -> car: [-44,-33] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn59, we do U -> then at turn60: y=4.\n\nNow, at turn60: freeway4 -> check at turn60 (T_rel=2).\n\nFreeway4 at turn60:\n    car1: [-43+4*2, -32+4*2] = [-43+8, -32+8] = [-35, -24] -> safe.\n    car2: [-7+8, 4+8] = [1,12] -> 0 not in? 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n    car3: [29+8,40+8] = [37,48] -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\nBut we lost one turn by waiting.\n\nPlan so far:\n\n    turn58: S -> then at turn59: y=3\n    turn59: U -> then at turn60: y=4\n    turn60: U -> then at turn61: y=5\n\nNow, at turn61: y=5 -> freeway5. Check freeway5 at turn61 (T_rel=3).\n\nFreeway5: two cars.\n    car1: [-11+12*3, 0+12*3] = [-11+36, 36] = [25,36] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n    car2: [37+12*3,48+12*3] = [37+36,48+36] = [73,84] -> safe.\n\nThen turn61: U -> turn62: y=6.\n\nAt turn62: freeway6 -> check at turn62 (T_rel=4).\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway5? \n    car1: [-11+12*4, 0+12*4] = [-11+48,48] = [37,48] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n    car2: [37+48,48+48] = [85,96] -> safe.\n\nThen turn62: U -> turn63: y=7.\n\nAt turn63: freeway7 -> check at turn63 (T_rel=5).\n\n    car1: [-11+12*5, 0+12*5] = [-11+60,60] = [49,60] -> safe.\n    car2: [37+60,48+60] = [97,108] -> safe.\n\nThen turn63: U -> turn64: y=8.\n\nAt turn64: freeway8 -> check at turn64 (T_rel=6).\n\n    car1: [-11+12*6, 0+12*6] = [-11+72,72] = [61,72] -> safe.\n    car2: [37+72,48+72] = [109,120] -> safe.\n\nThen turn64: U -> turn65: y=9. Goal.\n\nSo we did:\n    turn58: S\n    turn59: U\n    turn60: U\n    turn61: U\n    turn62: U\n    turn63: U\n    turn64: U\n\nTotal actions: 7, and we reach y=9 at turn65.\n\nBut is there a faster way? Minimal H? Without obstacles we need 6 actions. But we had to wait one turn.\n\nAlternative: could we avoid waiting and go up at turn58 to a different freeway? We can only go to y=4 or stay or go down.\n\nWe tried going to y=4 at turn59 and got blocked.\n\nWhat if we go down at turn58 to y=2? Then at turn59 we are at freeway2, which is safe (as we saw). Then we can go up from there.\n\nPlan:\n\n    turn58: D -> y59 = 2\n    turn59: U -> y60 = 3\n    turn60: U -> y61 = 4\n\nBut now at turn61: we are at y=4 -> freeway4 at turn61 (T_rel=3).\n\nCheck freeway4 at turn61:\n    car1: [-43+4*3, -32+4*3] = [-43+12, -32+12] = [-31,-20] -> safe.\n    car2: [-7+12, 4+12] = [5,16] -> safe.\n    car3: [29+12,40+12] = [41,52] -> safe.\n\nThen we can go up:\n\n    turn61: U -> y62=5\n    turn62: U -> y63=6\n    turn63: U -> y64=7\n    turn64: U -> y65=8\n    turn65: U -> y66=9\n\nThat took 8 actions (from turn58 to turn65: 8 actions) and we reached at turn66. So 8 actions -> H=8.\n\nBut our previous plan was 7 actions. So 7 is better.\n\nBut can we do better than 7?\n\nWe want to see if we can do 6 actions.\n\nWe must go up 6 times. But we cannot go up at turn58 because then at turn59 we are blocked at y=4.\n\nWhat if we go up at turn58 and then at turn59 we don't go up? But we are at y=4 at turn59 and we must avoid collision. At turn59, we are at y=4 and the car2 on freeway4 has span [-3,8] -> 0 is in. So we cannot stay at y=4? \n\nOptions at turn59 if we are at y=4: we can go up to y=5, down to y=3, or stay at y=4.\n\nBut if we go up to y=5, then at turn60 we are at freeway5.\n\nCheck freeway5 at turn60 (T_rel=2):\n    car1: [-11+12*2, 0+12*2] = [-11+24,24] = [13,24] -> safe.\n    car2: [37+24,48+24] = [61,72] -> safe.\n\nSo we can go from y=4 to y=5 at turn59.\n\nBut we are at y=4 at turn59 and we must not be there because of the car? \n\nExactly: at turn59, we are at y=4 and the car on freeway4 has a span that includes 0. So we are collided at turn59.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=4 at turn59. So if we go up at turn58, we are at y=4 at turn59 and that causes collision.\n\nSo we must avoid being at y=4 at turn59.\n\nTherefore, we cannot do a simple 6-step up.\n\nWhat if we do:\n\n    turn58: U -> then at turn59: y=4 (collision) -> not allowed.\n\nSo we must do something else at turn58: either S or D.\n\nWe tried S and D and got 7 and 8 actions.\n\nBut maybe we can do:\n\n    turn58: S (y59=3)\n    turn59: U (y60=4) -> now at turn60: y=4, which we checked at T_rel=2 (turn60) and it was safe.\n\nThen we have:\n\n    turn60: at y=4 -> safe.\n    Then we can do 5 more U: to go to y=9 in 5 more steps? \n        turn60: U -> y61=5\n        turn61: U -> y62=6\n        turn62: U -> y63=7\n        turn63: U -> y64=8\n        turn64: U -> y65=9\n\nTotal: 7 actions: S,U,U,U,U,U,U? \n\nWait: \n    turn58: S -> y59=3\n    turn59: U -> y60=4\n    turn60: U -> y61=5\n    turn61: U -> y62=6\n    turn62: U -> y63=7\n    turn63: U -> y64=8\n    turn64: U -> y65=9\n\nThat's 7 actions (from turn58 to turn64) and we are at y=9 at turn65.\n\nBut we have to check the freeways at each step.\n\nWe already checked:\n    turn58: y=3 -> safe (T_rel=0: freeway3: [-47,-36] -> safe)\n    turn59: y=3 -> safe (T_rel=1: freeway3: [-44,-33] -> safe)\n    turn60: y=4 -> safe (T_rel=2: freeway4: [-35,-24] and [1,12] and [37,48] -> safe)\n    turn61: y=5 -> freeway5: T_rel=3 -> [25,36] and [73,84] -> safe.\n    turn62: y=6 -> freeway6: same as freeway5? Actually, freeway6 has the same cars? Yes, the state says freeways 5,6,7,8 have the same two cars.\n\n        At turn62: T_rel=4.\n        freeway6: \n            car1: [-11+12*4, 0+12*4] = [37,48] -> safe.\n            car2: [37+48,48+48] = [85,96] -> safe.\n\n    turn63: y=7 -> freeway7: T_rel=5.\n        car1: [-11+60,60] = [49,60] -> safe.\n        car2: [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe.\n\n    turn64: y=8 -> freeway8: T_rel=6.\n        car1: [-11+72,72]=[61,72] -> safe.\n        car2: [37+72,48+72]=[109,120] -> safe.\n\nSo the entire path is safe.\n\nTotal actions: 7.\n\nIs there a way to do 6?\n\nWe need to get from y=3 to y=9 in 6 actions (so 6 steps of +1, meaning we must do 6 U's without any S or D). But we cannot do the first U at turn58 because that puts us at y=4 at turn59 and that is blocked.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 7.\n\nBut note: we could potentially do a down and then up, but that would take more steps.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to skip freeway4 at a different time.\n\nFor example, if we wait more than one turn at y=3? But then we are delayed more.\n\nWhat if we do:\n\n    turn58: U -> blocked at turn59 (y=4) -> not allowed.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nAnother idea: go up at turn58 to y=4, but then at turn59 we go down to y=3? \n\nAt turn58: U -> then at turn59: we are at y=4 -> and that is collision? Because at turn59, we are on freeway4 and the car has 0 in its span. So we are collided at turn59 regardless of what we do next. The collision is at the moment we are on the freeway at that turn.\n\nSo we cannot do that.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7.\n\nThe sequence:\n\n    Turn58: S\n    Turn59: U\n    Turn60: U\n    Turn61: U\n    Turn62: U\n    Turn63: U\n    Turn64: U\n\nBut note: at turn64 we do U and then we are at y=9 at turn65. And we have done 7 actions.\n\nThe problem says: the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so H=7.\n\nBut the problem also says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". In our case, t1=58, H=7, then t1+H-1=58+6=64. And at turn64, we are at y=8 (because we are about to do the last U). Then after the last U, we are at y=9 at turn65. But the requirement is y_{64}=9? It is not.\n\nSo we have a problem.\n\nThis brings us back to the confusion.\n\nIf the requirement is y_{t1+H-1}=9, then we must be at 9 at turn64 (the last action turn).\n\nIn our plan, at turn64 we are at y=8 and then we do U to go to y=9 at turn65. But we are not at 9 at turn64.\n\nSo we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn64? Then we don't need to move? But then we don't do an action at turn64? But the sequence includes turn64.\n\nAlternatively, we must have reached 9 by turn64.\n\nSo we must be at y=9 at turn64.\n\nWe start at turn58 at y=3. We need to get to y=9 by turn64, which is 6 turns later. So we need to cover 6 units in 6 turns: so we must do 6 U's without any delay.\n\nBut we saw that going U at turn58 leads to collision at turn59.\n\nTherefore, we must find a way to avoid the collision and still be at y=9 by turn64.\n\nWhat if we do:\n\n    turn58: U -> y59=4 (collision) -> not allowed.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nTherefore, we must take more than 6 actions? But then we would be at turn64 at y<9.\n\nBut the requirement is to be at 9 at turn64.\n\nThis seems impossible. \n\nUnless the problem means we are at 9 after the last action, i.e., at turn t1+H.\n\nGiven the confusion, and since the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", let me try to be at 9 at turn64.\n\nWe start at turn58: y58=3.\n\nWe have 6 actions: turn58,59,60,61,62,63 -> then at turn64 we are at y64.\n\nWe need y64=9.\n\nSo we must gain 6 in 6 actions: so we must do 6 U's.\n\nBut then:\n    turn58: U -> y59=4 -> collision at turn59 (freeway4: car2 has span [-3,8] at turn59 -> 0 is in).\n\nSo impossible.\n\nBut wait, is there a way to avoid the collision by taking a detour? \n\nFor example, go down at some point and then up? But then we would not gain 6 in 6 steps.\n\nExample:\n\n    turn58: D -> y59=2\n    turn59: U -> y60=3\n    turn60: U -> y61=4\n    turn61: U -> y62=5\n    turn62: U -> y63=6\n    turn63: U -> y64=7 -> not 9.\n\nWe are at 7, not 9.\n\nIf we do more U's, but we only have 6 actions.\n\nSo it seems impossible to reach y=9 in 6 actions without colliding.\n\nTherefore, minimal H must be 7, but then we are at y=9 at turn65, not at turn64.\n\nBut the problem requires y_{58+H-1}=9, which for H=7 would be turn64. \n\nSo we must be at 9 at turn64.\n\nHow? We start at turn58 at y=3. We have actions at turns 58,59,60,61,62,63 (6 actions) to reach y=9 at turn64.\n\nBut as above, we cannot do it without colliding.\n\nUnless there is a mistake in the car movement.\n\nLet me double-check freeway4 at turn59:\n\n    car2: at turn58: tail=-7, head=4, speed=4, right-moving.\n    At turn59: T_rel=1 -> tail = -7 + 4*1 = -3, head=4+4=8 -> span [-3,8] -> does this include 0? Yes.\n\nSo collision.\n\nBut is the span inclusive? Yes, it includes all integers from -3 to 8, so 0 is included.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on freeway4 at turn59.\n\nSo there is no way to do it in 6 actions.\n\nThen what? The minimal H must be 7, but then we are at 9 at turn65, not turn64.\n\nThis suggests that the problem meant to say that we require y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nGiven the context, I think that is the case.\n\nPerhaps the problem's \"y_{t1+H-1}\" is a typo and should be y_{t1+H}.\n\nIn many such problems, the position after H actions is at time t1+H.\n\nI will output the 7-action sequence that gets to y=9 at turn65.\n\nTo match the requirement, we could consider that the last action is at turn64 and then we are at 9 at turn65, but the problem might consider that as the final state.\n\nBut the answer format requires to write the actions for turns 58 to 58+H-1.\n\nFor H=7, that's turns 58 to 64.\n\nAnd in our sequence, we have:\n\n    Turn58: S\n    Turn59: U\n    Turn60: U\n    Turn61: U\n    Turn62: U\n    Turn63: U\n    Turn64: U\n\nAnd then at turn65: y=9.\n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", which is y_{64}=9. But in our case, y64=8.\n\nSo we must adjust.\n\nWhat if we do 7 actions but then at turn64 we are at 9? That means we must reach 9 at turn64.\n\nFrom y=3 at turn58, to y=9 at turn64, we need to gain 6 in 6 actions? The actions from turn58 to turn63 (6 actions) determine y59 to y64.\n\nWe need y64=9.\n\nWe must do 6 U's in 6 actions. But then we collide at turn59.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to avoid freeway4 at turn59 by not being there, but we have to be at y=4 at turn59 if we go up at turn58.\n\nUnless we can be at y=4 at a different turn? But we have to go through y=4.\n\nAnd the car is moving, but at turn59 it is at [-3,8], at turn58 it is at [-7,4] (which does not include 0? at turn58, freeway4 car2: span [-7,4] -> 0 is in [-7,4]? Yes, 0 is in [-7,4]. \n\nAt turn58, if we were to be at freeway4, we would collide. But we are not at freeway4 at turn58; we are at freeway3.\n\nSo the only problematic turn for freeway4 is turn58 and turn59? \n\nAt turn58: freeway4 car2: span [-7,4] -> 0 is in, so if we were at freeway4 at turn58, we would collide. But we are at freeway3.\n\nAt turn59: [-3,8] -> 0 in.\n\nAt turn60: [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway4 is only dangerous at turns when the car2 covers 0, which is from when the car2's span covers 0.\n\nFor car2 on freeway4: \n    span at T: [-7 + 4*(T-58), 4 + 4*(T-58)]\n    We need to know when 0 is in [ -7+4*(T-58), 4+4*(T-58) ].\n\n    Solve: -7 + 4*k <= 0 <= 4 + 4*k, where k=T-58.\n    -7+4k <= 0 -> 4k<=7 -> k<=1.75\n    0<=4+4k -> always true for k>=0.\n    So for k=0 and k=1, i.e., turn58 and turn59.\n\nTherefore, freeway4 is only dangerous at turns 58 and 59.\n\nFor other freeways, let's see when they cover 0.\n\nFreeway5 (and similarly 6,7,8) car1: span at T: [-11+12*(T-58), 0+12*(T-58)]\n    We need to know when 0 is in [ -11+12*k, 12*k ]\n    -11+12k <= 0 <= 12k\n    The right inequality: 0<=12k -> k>=0, always true for k>=0.\n    -11+12k<=0 -> 12k<=11 -> k<=0.916.\n    So only at k=0: turn58.\n\nAt turn58: freeway5 car1: span [-11,0] -> 0 is in. So if we are at freeway5 at turn58, we collide. But we are not.\n\nFor car2 on freeway5: [37+12*k,48+12*k] -> 0 is not in for any k>=0.\n\nSo freeway5 is only dangerous at turn58.\n\nFreeway1,2,3: car span: [-47+3*k, -36+3*k]\n    -47+3*k <= 0 <= -36+3k\n    From 0<=-36+3k -> k>=12.\n    From -47+3k<=0 -> k<=47/3~15.66.\n    So for k=12 to 15, inclusive.\n\n    k=12: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in.\n    k=13: [-47+39, -36+39] = [-8,3] -> 0 in.\n    k=14: [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6] -> 0 in.\n    k=15: [-47+45, -36+45] = [-2,9] -> 0 in.\n\n    So freeway1,2,3 are dangerous at turns 58+12=70, 71, 72, 73.\n\nBut we are planning to finish by turn64 or 65, so these are not in our horizon.\n\nSo only freeway4 is dangerous at turns58 and 59, and freeway5 at turn58.\n\nTherefore, the only constraint in the near term is to avoid freeway4 at turns58 and 59.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn64 ( if we interpret the problem as y_{64}=9) and we start at turn58 with 6 actions.\n\nWe must do 6 actions that include exactly 6 U's to gain 6.\n\nThe only way is to do 6 U's consecutively, but then we are at freeway4 at turn59 and collide.\n\n So it is impossible.\n\nTherefore, we must assume that the problem requires us to be at (0,9) at the end of the sequence, i.e., at turn t1+H.\n\nThen our 7-action sequence is valid and minimal.\n\n I think that is the case.\n\n So I will output the 7-action sequence.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 58: S\nTurn 59: U\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: U\nTurn 64: U\n\nBut to write in the box.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 58: S\nTurn 59: U\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: U\nTurn 64: U\n}\n\nWith H=7.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 58 is 7. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) as follows:\n\n- At turn 58, the player is at \\(y = 3\\). Taking action \"S\" (stay) keeps the player at \\(y = 3\\) for turn 59, avoiding freeway 4 at turn 59 where a car would cause a collision (span \\([-3, 8]\\) contains 0).\n- From turn 59 to turn 64, actions \"U\" (up) move the player upward by 1 each turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 65.\n\nThe car positions are checked at each turn:\n- Turn 58 (\\(y = 3\\)): Freeway 3 car span \\([-47, -36]\\) does not contain 0.\n- Turn 59 (\\(y = 3\\)): Freeway 3 car span \\([-44, -33]\\) does not contain 0.\n- Turn 60 (\\(y = 4\\)): Freeway 4 cars:\n  - \\([-35, -24]\\) does not contain 0,\n  - \\([1, 12]\\) does not contain 0,\n  - \\([37, 48]\\) does not contain 0.\n- Turn 61 (\\(y = 5\\)): Freeway 5 cars:\n  - \\([25, 36]\\) does not contain 0,\n  - \\([73, 84]\\) does not contain 0.\n- Turn 62 (\\(y = 6\\)): Freeway 6 cars:\n  - \\([37, 48]\\) does not contain 0,\n  - \\([85, 96]\\) does not contain 0.\n- Turn 63 (\\(y = 7\\)): Freeway 7 cars:\n  - \\([49, 60]\\) does not contain 0,\n  - \\([97, 108]\\) does not contain 0.\n- Turn 64 (\\(y = 8\\)): Freeway 8 cars:\n  - \\([61, 72]\\) does not contain 0,\n  - \\([109, 120]\\) does not contain 0.\n\nThe sequence of actions ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 65 without collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 58: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 59: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 60: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 61: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 62: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 63: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 64: \\text{ U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get the player from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are moving on each freeway, and I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at position 0 at that turn. The key point is that if I move to a new freeway, I'm not considered on that freeway until the next turn. So, for collision, it's only when I'm on a freeway at the start of the turn, and at that turn, if there's a car with 0 in its span.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=60, and they move with constant speed. For left-moving cars, the span moves left, and for right-moving, it moves right. In this case, all cars seem to be right-moving, since direction is \"right\" for all.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, h=-30, tau=-41, d=right, s=3\n\nSince it's right-moving, the tail is smaller, head is larger? No, the notation says: for right-moving, span at t1 is [tau, h], so in this case, tau=-41, h=-30? That seems backward.\n\nLook: \"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [tau, h] → [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nSo for right-moving, at time T, position is from tau + s(T-t1) to h + s(T-t1). Since it's moving right, tau should be the left end, h the right end? But in the notation, it says [tau, h] for right-moving, so tau is tail, h is head, so tail is left, head is right for right-moving car.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail tau, direction, speed). But for right-moving, head should be on the right.\n\nIn freeway 1: (-30, -41, right, 3). So head h=-30, tail tau=-41. Since right-moving, and h > tau, so head is at higher x, so car is from x=-41 to x=-30 at t1? But that doesn't make sense because -41 to -30, with h=-30, tau=-41, and since right-moving, at time T, the span is [tau + sΔT, h + sΔT], so from -41 + sΔT to -30 + sΔT.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, I am on freeway y, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in [low, high] of its span at time T.\n\nAnd I am on freeway y at time T if I start at (0,y) at the beginning of turn T.\n\nThe player position is given at turn t1, which is (0,4), so at turn 60, I am on y=4.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nEach action changes y for the next turn.\n\nLet me denote ΔT = T - t1 = T - 60.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, at time T, the span is:\n\nFor right-moving: low = tau + s * ΔT, high = h + s * ΔT\n\nAnd collision if y_T = k and low <= 0 <= high.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right here.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when there is a car at x=0.\n\nBut since multiple cars, I need for each freeway, the times when it is occupied, i.e., some car has 0 in span.\n\nThen I need to avoid being on that freeway at those times.\n\nBut since I move between freeways, I need to plan a path from y=4 to y=9 over time, avoiding the occupied times for each row.\n\ny is the freeway index, from 0 to 9, but freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, I assume. The problem says \"freeways y=1, ..., 8\", so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,4), which is freeway 4? y=4 is a freeway.\n\ny=4 has cars, so it might be occupied.\n\nGoal is (0,9), which is y=9, no freeway, so safe.\n\nNow, minimal H, so I want to go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nActions: U (up), D (down), S (stay). So y changes by +1, -1, 0.\n\nI start at y=4 at turn t=60.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn T, meaning that after H-1 actions, I am at y=9.\n\nLet t be the turn index, starting from t1=60.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t, and I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe collision is checked at the beginning of each turn, based on y_t and the car positions at time t.\n\nThen after action, I move to y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nWhen I reach y=9, I stop, and that turn I am at (0,9).\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find the set of times when it is occupied.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: h=-30, tau=-41, d=right, s=3\n\nAt time T, low = tau + s*(T-60) = -41 + 3*(T-60)\n\nhigh = h + s*(T-60) = -30 + 3*(T-60)\n\nOccupied when low <= 0 <= high\n\nSo -41 + 3ΔT <= 0 <= -30 + 3ΔT, where ΔT = T-60\n\nFirst inequality: -41 + 3ΔT <= 0 => 3ΔT <= 41 => ΔT <= 41/3 ≈ 13.666, so ΔT <= 13 since integer? T is turn, so integer.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -30 + 3ΔT => 30 <= 3ΔT => ΔT >= 10\n\nSo for freeway 1, occupied when ΔT from 10 to 13 inclusive.\n\nΔT >=10 and ΔT <=13, since ΔT integer.\n\nΔT=10: low = -41 + 30 = -11, high = -30 +30=0, so 0 <= high=0, so 0 is included, so yes, occupied.\n\nΔT=11: low=-41+33=-8, high=-30+33=3, 0 in [-8,3], yes.\n\nΔT=12: low=-41+36=-5, high=-30+36=6, 0 in, yes.\n\nΔT=13: low=-41+39=-2, high=-30+39=9, 0 in, yes.\n\nΔT=14: low=-41+42=1, high=-30+42=12, 0 not <= high=12? 0 <=12 is true, but low=1, so 1 <= 0 <=12? 0 >= low? The condition is low <= 0 <= high.\n\nlow <= 0 and 0 <= high.\n\nΔT=14: low=1, high=12, 1 <= 0? 1 <= 0 is false, so not <=0, so not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=9: low=-41+27=-14, high=-30+27=-3, 0 <= high=-3? 0 <= -3 false, so not occupied.\n\nSo freeway 1 occupied at ΔT=10,11,12,13.\n\nT=70,71,72,73? ΔT=T-60, so T=60+10=70 to 73.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1? Cars: (-30,-41,right,3) same as freeway 1.\n\nSo also occupied ΔT=10 to 13.\n\nT=70 to 73.\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-30,-41,right,3), so same, occupied ΔT=10-13.\n\nNow freeway 4: multiple cars.\n\nCars: (-24,-35,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (48,37,right,4)\n\nFirst car: h=-24, tau=-35, d=right, s=4? Head and tail.\n\nGiven as (head h, tail tau), so for right-moving, at T, low = tau + sΔT, high = h + sΔT\n\nFirst car: h=-24, tau=-35, s=4\n\nlow = -35 + 4ΔT\n\nhigh = -24 + 4ΔT\n\nOccupied when -35+4ΔT <= 0 <= -24+4ΔT\n\nSo from -35+4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/4=8.75, so ΔT <=8\n\nAnd 0 <= -24+4ΔT => 24 <=4ΔT => ΔT >=6\n\nSo ΔT=6,7,8\n\nΔT=6: low=-35+24= -11, high=-24+24=0, 0<=0, yes\n\nΔT=7: low=-35+28=-7, high=-24+28=4, 0 in, yes\n\nΔT=8: low=-35+32=-3, high=-24+32=8, 0 in, yes\n\nΔT=9: low=-35+36=1, high=-24+36=12, low=1>0, not <=0, so not\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4) h=12, tau=1, s=4\n\nlow = tau + sΔT =1 +4ΔT\n\nhigh =12 +4ΔT\n\nOccupied when 1+4ΔT <= 0 <= 12+4ΔT\n\nBut 1+4ΔT <=0? Since ΔT >=0, 1+4ΔT >=1 >0, so never <=0, thus 0 cannot be <= low if low>0. Specifically, low =1+4ΔT >=1 >0, so low >0, thus 0 < low, so not <= low, so never occupied for this car. Because the car is always to the right of 0? At ΔT=0, tau=1, so from x=1 to x=12, so 0 not in, and as it moves right, always right of 0. So never at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (48,37,right,4) h=48, tau=37, s=4\n\nlow=37+4ΔT >0, high=48+4ΔT>0, so always right of 0, never at x=0.\n\nSo for freeway 4, only the first car matters, occupied at ΔT=6,7,8, so T=66,67,68.\n\nΔT=6,7,8 → T=66,67,68.\n\nNow freeway 5: cars: (24,13,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nFirst car: h=24, tau=13, s=12\n\nlow = tau + sΔT =13 +12ΔT\n\nhigh=24+12ΔT\n\nSince low=13+12ΔT >=13>0, always greater than 0, so never <=0, so not occupied.\n\nSecond car: (-48,-59,right,12) h=-48, tau=-59, s=12\n\nlow = tau + sΔT = -59 +12ΔT\n\nhigh = h + sΔT = -48 +12ΔT\n\nOccupied when -59+12ΔT <=0 <= -48+12ΔT\n\nFirst, -59+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=59 => ΔT <= 59/12 ≈4.916, so ΔT <=4\n\nSecond, 0 <= -48+12ΔT => 48 <=12ΔT => ΔT >=4\n\nSo ΔT=4\n\nΔT=4: low=-59+48= -11, high=-48+48=0, 0<=0, yes\n\nΔT=5: low=-59+60=1, high=-48+60=12, low=1>0, not <=0, so not\n\nΔT=3: low=-59+36= -23, high=-48+36= -12, 0 <= high=-12? false, not\n\nSo only at ΔT=4, T=64\n\nNow freeway 6: same as 5? Cars: (24,13,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12) same as freeway 5.\n\nSo occupied at ΔT=4, T=64\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same cars, (24,13,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), so occupied at ΔT=4, T=64\n\nFreeway 8: same, (24,13,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), occupied at ΔT=4, T=64\n\nNow, freeways 1,2,3 have cars only at T=70,71,72,73\n\nFreeway 4 at T=66,67,68\n\nFreeways 5,6,7,8 at T=64 only? T=64.\n\nBut for freeways 5-8, at T=64, occupied.\n\nNow, also, for freeways with no cars, like if not listed, but all freeways have cars listed? Freeway 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 all have cars.\n\nBut for example, freeway 1,2,3 only occupied at T=70-73, other times not.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 only at T=66-68.\n\nFreeways 5-8 only at T=64.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=4 at t=60 to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is also safe, but I start at y=4, need to go up to y=9.\n\nMinimal H, so I want to go up as fast as possible, which is 5 steps up, so in 5 turns I can be at y=9.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, and collision if y_t is between 1 and 8 and occupied at time t.\n\nSince I start at t=60, y=4.\n\nNow, let's see the occupied times:\n\nFirst, at t=60, what is occupied?\n\nΔT=0, T=60.\n\nFor freeway 1: at ΔT=0, low=-41, high=-30, 0 not in, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2,3 same.\n\nFreeway 4: at ΔT=0, first car: low=-35, high=-24, 0 not in. Second and third not, so not occupied.\n\nFreeway 5: at ΔT=0, first car low=13>0, not; second car low=-59, high=-48, 0 not in (-59 to -48), so not occupied.\n\nSimilarly others, so at t=60, no freeway is occupied? But I am at y=4, which is not occupied at t=60.\n\nNow, I can choose actions.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe fastest is to go up every turn: U,U,U,U,U, so from y=4 to 5,6,7,8,9 in 5 turns.\n\nBut let's see if I can do that without collision.\n\nAt t=60, I am at y=4. I choose action for next position.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t=60: I am at y=4. I choose a_{60}, which sets y_{61} = y_{60} + Δy, depending on a_{60}.\n\nCollision is at the beginning of the turn, based on y_t.\n\nSo at turn t, position y_t, if y_t in 1-8 and occupied at t, collision.\n\nThen after action, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nFor turn t=60: y_{60}=4, occupied? As above, at T=60, freeway 4 not occupied, so safe.\n\nI choose a_{60}. If I choose U, then y_{61} = 5.\n\nNow, at turn t=61: y_{61}=5.\n\nIs freeway 5 occupied at t=61?\n\nt=61, ΔT=1, T=61.\n\nFreeway 5: occupied only at ΔT=4, t=64, as above.\n\nAt t=61, ΔT=1, not occupied, since only at t=64.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways not occupied at t=61 except possibly, but freeway 4 occupied at 66-68, etc., not 61.\n\nSo at t=61, y=5, not occupied, safe.\n\nThen I choose a_{61}, say U, to y_{62}=6.\n\nTurn t=62: y=6.\n\nIs freeway 6 occupied? Only at t=64, so at t=62, not occupied, safe.\n\nThen U to y_{63}=7.\n\nTurn t=63: y=7.\n\nFreeway 7 occupied only at t=64, so at t=63, not occupied, safe.\n\nThen U to y_{64}=8.\n\nNow turn t=64: y_{64}=8.\n\nNow, is freeway 8 occupied at t=64?\n\nFreeway 8: at t=64, ΔT=4, which is occupied, as we saw for freeways 5-8.\n\nYes, at t=64, freeway 8 is occupied.\n\nSo if I am at y=8 at turn t=64, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nSo going straight up, at turn 64 I am at y=8 when it is occupied.\n\nNot good.\n\nI could choose to stay or something.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nSince at t=64, freeways 5,6,7,8 are all occupied, I should not be on any of them at t=64.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 all occupied at t=64.\n\ny=4 might be safe, but let's see.\n\nAt t=64, freeway 4 occupied? Freeway 4 occupied at t=66,67,68, not at t=64.\n\nt=64, ΔT=4.\n\nFreeway 4: occupied only at ΔT=6,7,8, so t=66,67,68. At t=64, ΔT=4, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 1,2,3 not occupied at t=64 (since at 70-73).\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nSo at t=64, only freeways 5,6,7,8 are occupied, others are safe.\n\nSpecifically, y=4 is safe at t=64.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI could go up to y=4,5,6,7, but at t=64 I need to not be on 5-8.\n\nCurrently at t=60, y=4.\n\nIf I go up to y=5 at t=61, y=6 at t=62, y=7 at t=63.\n\nAt t=63, y=7.\n\nNow, at t=64, if I go up to y=8, but y=8 occupied, collision.\n\nIf I stay, y=7 at t=64, but y=7 occupied at t=64, collision.\n\nIf I go down, to y=6 at t=64, but y=6 occupied, collision.\n\nAll actions lead to y=6,7, or 8 at t=64, all occupied.\n\ny=7 at t=63, after action at t=63, I set y_{64}.\n\nIf I choose S, y_{64} = y_{63} =7, then at turn t=64, y=7, occupied.\n\nIf I choose D, y_{64}=6, then at t=64, y=6, occupied.\n\nIf I choose U, y_{64}=8, occupied.\n\nSo indeed, if I am on y=7 at t=63, I cannot avoid collision at t=64 because whatever I do, I end up on a row that is occupied at t=64.\n\ny=6,7,8 are all occupied at t=64.\n\ny=5 also, but I am at y=7 at t=63.\n\nPerhaps I should not be on y=7 at t=63.\n\nMaybe I need to delay or go down earlier.\n\nBut I want minimal turns.\n\nSince I need to avoid t=64 for rows 5-8.\n\nAnother idea: I could go to y=9 before t=64 or after, but y=9 has no cars, so always safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to be at y=8 at some point, but y=8 is only occupied at t=64, other times not.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeways 5-8 are only occupied at t=64, not at other times.\n\nFreeway 4 occupied at t=66,67,68.\n\nFreeways 1-3 at t=70-73.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nNow, to go from y=4 to y=9.\n\nThe direct path in 5 steps: t=60 y=4, t=61 y=5, t=62 y=6, t=63 y=7, t=64 y=8, t=65 y=9.\n\nBut at t=64, y=8 occupied, collision.\n\nIf I can skip t=64 or be on safe row.\n\nAt t=63, if I am on y=6, for example.\n\nBut let's list the times to avoid for each row.\n\nRow 5: avoid t=64\n\nRow 6: avoid t=64\n\nRow 7: avoid t=64\n\nRow 8: avoid t=64\n\nRow 4: avoid t=66,67,68\n\nRow 3: avoid t=70,71,72,73\n\nRow 2: same as 3\n\nRow 1: same\n\nNow, I start at t=60, y=4.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince row 8 has only one bad time, t=64, I can be on row 8 at other times.\n\nSimilarly for 5,6,7.\n\nBut at t=64, I must not be on rows 5-8.\n\nSo I need to be on row 4 or below, or row 9 or above, but row 9 is goal, y=0 is below.\n\ny=4 is row 4, which at t=64 is safe.\n\ny=3,2,1,0 also safe at t=64.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at y=4 for a few turns or go down temporarily.\n\nBut that might increase H.\n\nMinimal H, so I want to go up as much as possible.\n\nThe conflict is only at t=64.\n\nSo if I can be at y=4 at t=64, for example.\n\nThen after that, I can go up.\n\nBut at t=64, if I am at y=4, safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go to y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut row 4 is occupied at t=66,67,68, so I need to be off row 4 by t=66.\n\nSimilarly, rows 1-3 occupied later.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nStart: t=60, y=4, safe.\n\nI need to choose actions.\n\nIf I go up at t=60: a_{60}=U, so y_{61}=5\n\nt=61: y=5, safe (not occupied)\n\nThen at t=61, I can choose U to y_{62}=6\n\nt=62: y=6, safe\n\nThen at t=62, if I choose U to y_{63}=7\n\nt=63: y=7, safe? At t=63, is row 7 occupied? Only at t=64, so at t=63, not occupied, safe.\n\nThen at t=63, I need to set y_{64}.\n\nIf I choose U, y_{64}=8, but at t=64, y=8 occupied, bad.\n\nIf I choose S, y_{64}=7, occupied at t=64, bad.\n\nIf I choose D, y_{64}=6, occupied at t=64, bad.\n\nAll bad.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=7 at t=63.\n\nSimilarly, if I am at y=6 at t=62, I could choose to go down or stay to avoid y=7 at t=63.\n\nFor example, at t=62, y=6, I could choose D to go to y=5 at t=63.\n\nThen t=63, y=5.\n\nAt t=63, y=5, safe (not occupied at t=63).\n\nThen at t=63, I choose action for y_{64}.\n\nIf I choose S, y_{64}=5, but at t=64, y=5 occupied, bad.\n\nIf I choose U, y_{64}=6, occupied at t=64, bad.\n\nIf I choose D, y_{64}=4, then at t=64, y=4, which is safe.\n\nSo possible.\n\nSo from t=62, y=6, I choose D, to y=5 at t=63.\n\nThen at t=63, y=5, I choose D, to y=4 at t=64.\n\nThen t=64, y=4, safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nBut I am at y=4 at t=64, and I need to go to y=9.\n\nNow, row 4 is occupied at t=66,67,68, so I need to be off row 4 before t=66.\n\nt=64, y=4, safe.\n\nt=65, if I go up to y=5, then at t=65, y=5.\n\nIs row 5 occupied at t=65? Only at t=64, so t=65 not occupied, safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=66, if I am on row 4, occupied, bad.\n\nSo I need to not be on row 4 at t=66.\n\nAt t=65, if I am at y=5, I can go up.\n\nSet t=64: y=4\n\nI choose a_{64}, say U, to y_{65}=5\n\nt=65: y=5, safe (not occupied)\n\nThen at t=65, choose a_{65}, say U to y_{66}=6\n\nt=66: y=6, but row 6 occupied? Row 6 is only occupied at t=64, not at t=66. t=66 is not t=64, so not occupied.\n\nBut row 4 is occupied at t=66, but I am at y=6, not row 4.\n\nAt t=66, y=6.\n\nRow 6: occupied only at t=64, so at t=66, not occupied, safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue up.\n\nBut row 4 occupied at t=66,67,68, but I am not on row 4.\n\nNow, from t=65 y=5, to t=66 y=6.\n\nThen t=66 y=6, choose U to y_{67}=7\n\nt=67: y=7, row 7 occupied? Only at t=64, not t=67, safe.\n\nThen U to y_{68}=8\n\nt=68: y=8, row 8 occupied? Only at t=64, not t=68, safe.\n\nThen U to y_{69}=9\n\nt=69: y=9, reached.\n\nBut at turn t=69, I am at (0,9), which is the goal.\n\nNow, let's count the turns.\n\nStart t=60, y=4\n\nActions:\n\nt=60: U, to y=5 at t=61\n\nt=61: U, to y=6 at t=62\n\nt=62: D, to y=5 at t=63? Earlier I said at t=62 I choose D to go to y=5 at t=63.\n\nIn the path I just described, I have:\n\nt=60: U → y=5 at t=61\n\nt=61: U → y=6 at t=62\n\nt=62: D → y=5 at t=63? No.\n\nAt t=62, I choose D, so y_{63} = y_{62} -1 =6-1=5\n\nThen t=63: y=5\n\nThen at t=63, I choose D, so y_{64} =5-1=4\n\nt=64: y=4\n\nThen t=64: U → y_{65}=5\n\nt=65: y=5\n\nt=65: U → y_{66}=6\n\nt=66: y=6\n\nt=66: U → y_{67}=7\n\nt=67: y=7\n\nt=67: U → y_{68}=8\n\nt=68: y=8\n\nt=68: U → y_{69}=9\n\nt=69: y=9\n\nNow, from t=60 to t=69, that's 9 turns? t=60 to t=69 is 10 turns? Let's see the indices.\n\nAt turn t, after action, position changes for next turn.\n\nStart: turn t=60, position y=4.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, at turn t + H -1, position is y=9.\n\nIn this case, first action at t=60, sets y_{61}=5\n\nThen action at t=61, sets y_{62}=6\n\nAction at t=62, sets y_{63}=5\n\nAction at t=63, sets y_{64}=4\n\nAction at t=64, sets y_{65}=5\n\nAction at t=65, sets y_{66}=6\n\nAction at t=66, sets y_{67}=7\n\nAction at t=67, sets y_{68}=8\n\nAction at t=68, sets y_{69}=9\n\nNow, at turn t=69, I am at y=9, so I have reached at turn t=69.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=60 to t=68, that's 9 actions? t=60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68: that's 9 actions.\n\nH is the number of turns? The minimal number of turns H, meaning the number of turns from start to end.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, t1=60, actions at t=60 to t=68, that's 9 actions, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nAt turn t=60 + H -1, position is y=9.\n\nHere, at t=69, y=9, so t=69 = 60 + 9, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nBut is this minimal? Earlier I thought 5, but due to obstacles, I had to detour.\n\nPerhaps I can do better.\n\nInstead of going down at t=62 and t=63, maybe I can stay or go up differently.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=64, rows 5-8 occupied, I could be on y=9 or y=4 or below.\n\nBut y=9 I can reach later.\n\nPerhaps go to y=3 or something, but that might take longer.\n\nStart at t=60 y=4.\n\nIf I choose to stay at t=60: a_{60}=S, then y_{61}=4\n\nt=61: y=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=61, I can choose U to y_{62}=5\n\nt=62: y=5, safe\n\nThen at t=62, choose U to y_{63}=6\n\nt=63: y=6, safe\n\nThen at t=63, I need to set y_{64}.\n\nIf I choose U, y_{64}=7, occupied bad\n\nS, y_{64}=6, occupied bad\n\nD, y_{64}=5, occupied bad\n\nAll bad for rows 5-8 at t=64.\n\nSo I must not be on rows 5,6,7 at t=63, because from there I go to 6,7,8 or stay, all occupied at t=64.\n\nIf at t=63 I am at y=4, then I can go to y=4 at t=64 by S, or y=5, etc.\n\nBut y=4 at t=64 is safe.\n\nHow to be at y=4 at t=63.\n\nStart: t=60 y=4\n\nChoose S at t=60: y_{61}=4\n\nt=61: y=4\n\nChoose S at t=61: y_{62}=4\n\nt=62: y=4\n\nThen at t=62, choose S or D or U.\n\nIf I choose U to y_{63}=5\n\nt=63: y=5\n\nThen at t=63, I can choose D to y_{64}=4\n\nThen t=64: y=4, safe.\n\nThen from there, same as before, go up to y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut this takes more turns because I stayed at y=4 for two extra turns.\n\nt=60 S to y=4 at t=61? No.\n\nt=60 action S: y_{61} = y_{60} =4, so position at t=61 is 4.\n\nThen t=61 action S: y_{62}=4\n\nt=62 action: if U, y_{63}=5\n\nt=63 action D: y_{64}=4\n\nt=64 action U: y_{65}=5\n\nt=65 U: y_{66}=6\n\nt=66 U: y_{67}=7\n\nt=67 U: y_{68}=8\n\nt=68 U: y_{69}=9\n\nReach at t=69, same as before, but I used two S actions, so more actions.\n\nIn the first path, I used U,U,D,D,U,U,U,U,U or something.\n\nFirst path: actions at t=60 U, t=61 U, t=62 D, t=63 D, t=64 U, t=65 U, t=66 U, t=67 U, t=68 U\n\nThat's 9 actions, to reach at t=69.\n\nIf I don't go down, but go to y=9 before t=64.\n\nt=60 y=4\n\nU at t=60: y=5 at t=61\n\nU at t=61: y=6 at t=62\n\nU at t=62: y=7 at t=63\n\nNow at t=63 y=7, I need to set y_{64}.\n\nBut I cannot go to y=8 because occupied, but if I go to y=9 directly? But I can only change by 1, so from y=7, I can go to y=8 or y=6 or y=7.\n\nCannot jump to y=9.\n\nSo not possible to reach y=9 before t=64.\n\nAt t=63, if I am at y=7, I must go to y=6,7, or 8 at t=64, all occupied.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=7 at t=63.\n\nSimilarly, if I am at y=6 at t=62, I could go to y=5 at t=63, then to y=4 at t=64.\n\nBut y=5 at t=63 is safe, as before.\n\nPerhaps go to y=3 or something, but that might not help.\n\nAnother idea: at t=64, since rows 5-8 occupied, but row 9 is safe, so if I can be at y=9 at t=64, but I start from y=4, to y=9 in 5 steps: t=60 to t=65: actions at t=60 U to y5, t=61 U to y6, t=62 U to y7, t=63 U to y8, t=64 U to y9.\n\nAt t=64, I set y_{65}=9? Let's see:\n\nt=60: y=4, action U → y_{61}=5\n\nt=61: y=5, action U → y_{62}=6\n\nt=62: y=6, action U → y_{63}=7\n\nt=63: y=7, action U → y_{64}=8\n\nt=64: y=8, but at turn t=64, I am at y=8, which is occupied, collision before I even take the action? Collision is checked at the beginning of the turn.\n\nAt turn t=64, position is y_{64}, which is set from previous action.\n\nIf at t=63, I set y_{64}=8, then at turn t=64, I am at y=8, and since row 8 occupied at t=64, collision occurs, and I cannot take the action.\n\nSo I don't reach y=9.\n\nIf I could be at y=9 at t=64, but from y=4, I need 5 actions: t=60 to t=64 actions to go to y=9 at t=65? Let's see:\n\nAfter action at t=64, position at t=65.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn T, it means after H-1 actions from t=60.\n\nAt turn t=60, position y=4.\n\nAfter first action at t=60, position at t=61.\n\nAfter k actions, position at t=60 + k.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn T, T = t1 + (H-1) = 60 + (H-1)\n\nFor example, after 5 actions: at t=65, y=9.\n\nBut at t=64, where am I?\n\nIf I take actions: t=60 U → y=5 at t=61\n\nt=61 U → y=6 at t=62\n\nt=62 U → y=7 at t=63\n\nt=63 U → y=8 at t=64\n\nt=64 U → y=9 at t=65\n\nAt turn t=64, I am at y=8, which is occupied, so collision at t=64, before I take the action to go to y=9.\n\nSo I cannot take that action.\n\nThus, I cannot reach y=9 at t=65 this way.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=9 is after avoiding the bad time.\n\nIn the first path I had, I reach at t=69.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach earlier.\n\nt=69 is 9 turns after start? t=60 to t=69 is 9 turns later, but turns include t=60.\n\nNumber of turns from start to end: from turn t=60 to turn t=69, that's 10 turns, but I start at turn t=60, and end at turn t=69.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think.\n\nThe problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\"\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter these H actions, the position is at (0,9) at turn t1 + H.\n\nLet's see.\n\nAt turn t1, position is given, say y_{t1}.\n\nThen action a_{t1} determines y_{t1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAction a_{t1 + k} determines y_{t1 + k +1}\n\nAfter H actions, the last action is at t1 + H -1, which sets y_{t1 + H}\n\nAnd we want y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nAnd the turn when we reach is t1 + H.\n\nIn this case, t1=60.\n\nIn my sequence, I have actions from t=60 to t=68, that's 9 actions (t=60 to 68 inclusive is 9 actions), so H=9 actions? t from 0 to H-1, so if H actions, indices from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, position at t1 + H.\n\nFor example, no action: at t1, position y, if y=9, H=0, but here y=4 not 9.\n\nWith actions.\n\nIn my sequence: actions at t=60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68: that's 9 actions.\n\nThen position at t=69 is y=9.\n\nSo t1 + H = 60 + H = 69, so H=9.\n\nt1 + H =69, t1=60, so H=9.\n\nNumber of turns H=9.\n\nBut can I do with fewer?\n\nSuppose I go up directly but skip t=64.\n\nFor example, be at y=4 at t=64.\n\nHow to get to y=4 at t=64 from start.\n\nStart t=60 y=4.\n\nIf I stay: t=60 S → y=4 at t=61\n\nt=61 S → y=4 at t=62\n\nt=62 S → y=4 at t=63\n\nt=63 S → y=4 at t=64\n\nThen at t=64 y=4, safe.\n\nThen from here, go up: t=64 U → y=5 at t=65\n\nt=65 U → y=6 at t=66\n\nt=66 U → y=7 at t=67\n\nt=67 U → y=8 at t=68\n\nt=68 U → y=9 at t=69\n\nReach at t=69, same as before, with more S actions.\n\nBut I used S from t=60 to t=63, that's four S, then U five times, total 9 actions, same H=9.\n\nBut in my first path, I used only two extra actions: down and down, then up.\n\nIn first path: actions: U,U,D,D,U,U,U,U,U for t=60 to 68.\n\n9 actions.\n\nNow, from y=4 at t=64, I need to go to y=9.\n\nBut row 4 is occupied at t=66,67,68.\n\nAt t=66, if I am on row 4, occupied.\n\nIn the go up path: t=64 U to y=5 at t=65\n\nt=65 U to y=6 at t=66\n\nAt t=66, y=6, which is not row 4, so safe.\n\nThen to y=7 at t=67, y=8 at t=68, y=9 at t=69.\n\nAll fine.\n\nBut can I reach earlier than t=69?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=8 before t=64 or after, but after t=64 is fine.\n\nt=64 is the only bad time for rows 5-8.\n\nSo at t=65, I can be on row 5, for example.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster.\n\nSuppose I go to y=8 at t=63.\n\nt=63 y=8.\n\nIs it possible?\n\nt=60 U to y=5 at t=61\n\nt=61 U to y=6 at t=62\n\nt=62 U to y=7 at t=63\n\nt=63 U to y=8 at t=64? But at t=64 y=8 occupied.\n\nIf at t=62, I go directly to y=8, but I can only change by 1, so not possible.\n\nFrom y=6 at t=62, I can go to y=7 at t=63, then to y=8 at t=64, but occupied.\n\nAt t=63, if I am at y=8, but how? From y=7 at t=63, I set y_{64}=8, so at t=64 I am at y=8.\n\nI cannot be at y=8 at t=63 directly from below.\n\nStart y=4 at t=60.\n\nAfter one action, t=61, y=5\n\nAfter two actions, t=62, y=6\n\nAfter three actions, t=63, y=7 or y=5 or y=6, etc., but not y=8.\n\nAfter four actions, t=64, y=8 or y=6, etc.\n\nBut y=8 at t=64 occupied.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=9 before t=65.\n\nAt t=65, y=9 possible if no obstacles, but with obstacles, I need to be at y=8 at t=64 to go to y=9 at t=65, but y=8 at t=64 occupied.\n\nSo I cannot reach at t=65.\n\nSimilarly, at t=66: to be at y=9 at t=66, I need to be at y=8 at t=65.\n\ny=8 at t=65 is safe, since only occupied at t=64.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at t=64 occupied, but at t=65 not.\n\nSo possible to be at y=8 at t=65, then U to y=9 at t=66.\n\nBut I need to reach y=8 at t=65.\n\nFrom start, how to get to y=8 at t=65.\n\nt=65 position y=8.\n\nThat means after actions at t=60 to t=64, position at t=65 is y=8.\n\nActions: let y_t be position at turn t.\n\ny_{60} =4\n\na_{60} determines y_{61}\n\n...\n\na_{64} determines y_{65}\n\nWe want y_{65} =8.\n\ny_{65} = y_{64} + Δy, depending on a_{64}\n\nBut y_{64} must be 7,8, or9, but y=9 not yet, so y_{64} =7 or8 or9.\n\nIf y_{64}=7, a_{64}=U to y_{65}=8\n\nIf y_{64}=8, a_{64}=S to y_{65}=8\n\nBut y_{64} at t=64 must not be occupied if it is freeway.\n\nNow, at t=64, if y_{64}=7 or8, both occupied, collision.\n\nIf y_{64}=9, but y=9 not freeway, safe, but I am not at y=9 yet.\n\ny_{64} could be less.\n\ny_{64} must be 7 or 8 to reach y_{65}=8 with U or S.\n\nBut if y_{64}=7, at t=64 occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly y_{64}=8 occupied.\n\nIf y_{64}=6, I can go to y_{65}=7 with U, but not to 8 directly.\n\nTo y_{65}=8, I need to be at y=7 or 8 at t=64.\n\nBut both occupied at t=64, so impossible to have y_{65}=8 without being on occupied row at t=64.\n\nSimilarly, for any position on rows 5-8 at t=64, occupied.\n\nSo I cannot be on those rows at t=64, so I cannot start from there to go to y=8 at t=65.\n\nThus, I cannot have y_{65}=8.\n\nSimilarly, y_{65}=7: to be at y=7 at t=65, I need y_{64}=6 or7 or8, with appropriate action.\n\nBut y_{64} at t=64, if on freeway, must not be occupied.\n\ny_{64}=6: if I set y_{65}=7 with U, but y_{64}=6 at t=64 occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, y_{64}=7 or8 occupied.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=7 at t=65 either, because it requires being at occupied row at t=64.\n\ny_{65} = y_{64} + Δy\n\nIf Δy=0, y_{65}=y_{64}, so y_{64} must be 7.\n\nBut y_{64}=7 at t=64 occupied.\n\nIf Δy=+1, y_{65}=y_{64} +1, so if y_{65}=7, then y_{64}=6.\n\ny_{64}=6 at t=64 occupied.\n\nIf Δy=-1, y_{65}=y_{64}-1, if y_{65}=7, then y_{64}=8, occupied.\n\nSimilarly, all cases, to have y_{65}=7, y_{64} must be 6,7, or8, all occupied at t=64.\n\nThus impossible to be at y=7 at t=65.\n\nSimilarly for y=6 or y=5 at t=65, same issue.\n\nBut y=4 at t=65 is possible, if I come from below.\n\nBut I don't need that.\n\nPoint is, I cannot be on rows 5-8 at t=65? No, at t=65, rows 5-8 are not occupied, only at t=64.\n\nBut to reach them at t=65, I need to be on rows 4-8 at t=64, but rows 5-8 occupied at t=64, so I can only be on row 4 or row 9 or y=0 at t=64 to go to rows 5-8 at t=65.\n\nFor example, at t=64, if I am at y=4, I can go to y=5 at t=65.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=9, I can stay or go down, but not needed.\n\nSo from y=4 at t=64, I can go to y=5 at t=65, then to y=6 at t=66, etc.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at t=66: y_{66}=9.\n\nThen y_{65} must be 8 or 9.\n\ny_{65}=9: to be at y=9 at t=65, need y_{64}=8 or9, but y_{64}=8 occupied, y=9 not possible yet.\n\ny_{65}=8: as above, impossible because requires y_{64} on occupied row.\n\nThus y_{66}=9 requires y_{65}=8 or9.\n\ny_{65}=9 impossible from below.\n\ny_{65}=8 impossible as above.\n\nThus I cannot reach y=9 at t=66.\n\nSimilarly, at t=67: y_{67}=9 requires y_{66}=8 or9.\n\ny_{66}=8: possible, since row 8 not occupied at t=66.\n\ny_{66}=8 means position at turn t=66 is y=8.\n\nTo have y_{66}=8, need actions such that after action at t=65, position at t=66 is 8.\n\ny_{66} = y_{65} + Δy with a_{65}\n\nSo y_{65} must be 7,8,9.\n\ny_{65} at t=65 not occupied for rows 7,8.\n\nSimilarly, y_{65}=7 possible.\n\nNow, how to get to y_{65}=7.\n\ny_{65}=7 requires y_{64} to be 6,7,8 with a_{64}.\n\nBut y_{64} at t=64: if y_{64}=6,7,8 occupied, collision.\n\nIf y_{64}=5, I can go to y_{65}=6 with U, but not to 7.\n\nCannot reach y_{65}=7 directly.\n\ny_{65} = y_{64} + Δy\n\nIf y_{65}=7, then:\n\n- If Δy=0, y_{64}=7\n\n- If Δy=+1, y_{64}=6\n\n- If Δy=-1, y_{64}=8\n\nAll of which are occupied at t=64, so impossible to have y_{65}=7.\n\nSimilarly, y_{65}=6 or 5 or 8, all impossible for the same reason.\n\nOnly y_{65}=4 or 3 etc. or 9 possible, but 9 not.\n\nSo at t=65, I can only be on y=4 or below or y=9, but y=9 not reached.\n\nThus, the earliest I can be on row 5 is at t=65, from y=4 at t=64.\n\nThen y=6 at t=66, y=7 at t=67, y=8 at t=68, y=9 at t=69.\n\nWhich is what I had.\n\nIf I can be on row 8 at t=65, but impossible as above.\n\nSo H=9 seems necessary.\n\nBut in my first path, I reached at t=69 with H=9.\n\nNow, in that path, I went down to y=4 at t=64.\n\nBut I could have stayed at y=4 earlier.\n\nBut minimal actions.\n\nAnother thing: I need to avoid row 4 at bad times.\n\nIn the go up path from t=64: t=64 y=4, U to y=5 at t=65, U to y=6 at t=66, etc.\n\nAt t=66, y=6, which is fine, row 6 not occupied.\n\nBut row 4 is occupied at t=66, but I am not on it.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nNow, but I have to go through row 4 at t=64, which is safe.\n\nIn the sequence, I have to specify actions.\n\nNow, back to the actions.\n\nIn the first sequence I thought: actions at:\n\nt=60: U (to y=5 at t=61)\n\nt=61: U (to y=6 at t=62)\n\nt=62: D (to y=5 at t=63)\n\nt=63: D (to y=4 at t=64)\n\nt=64: U (to y=5 at t=65)\n\nt=65: U (to y=6 at t=66)\n\nt=66: U (to y=7 at t=67)\n\nt=67: U (to y=8 at t=68)\n\nt=68: U (to y=9 at t=69)\n\nNow, at each turn, check collision.\n\nt=60: y=4, not occupied, safe\n\nt=61: y=5, not occupied (only at t=64), safe\n\nt=62: y=6, not occupied, safe\n\nt=63: y=5, not occupied, safe? y=5 at t=63, row 5 occupied only at t=64, so t=63 safe.\n\nt=64: y=4, row 4 not occupied (occupied at 66-68), safe\n\nt=65: y=5, safe\n\nt=66: y=6, row 6 not occupied, safe\n\nt=67: y=7, safe\n\nt=68: y=8, safe\n\nThen at t=69, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose I go to y=3 or something, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=62, instead of going down, I go up to y=7 at t=63, but then stuck, must go down or something, but then I might have to go down to y=4 anyway, and take more actions.\n\nFor instance, if at t=62 y=6, I go U to y=7 at t=63.\n\nt=63 y=7, then I must go down to avoid t=64, say D to y=6 at t=64, but y=6 at t=64 occupied, collision.\n\nIf I go D at t=63 to y=6 at t=64, same.\n\nOr S, same.\n\nSo I must go down at t=63 to y=5 or something, but y=5 at t=64 occupied.\n\nUnless I go down to y=4 at t=64.\n\nBut from y=7 at t=63, I go D to y=6 at t=64? No.\n\na_{t} sets y_{t+1}\n\nAt t=63, y=7, choose D, then y_{64}=6.\n\nBut at t=64, y=6 occupied, collision.\n\nChoose S, y_{64}=7, occupied.\n\nChoose U, y_{64}=8, occupied.\n\nAll bad.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=7 at t=63.\n\nSimilarly, I must be at y<=4 or y>=9 at t=63, but y=9 not possible.\n\nSo at t=63, I must be at y=4 or below.\n\nIn the sequence, I have at t=63 y=5, which is above, but at t=63 y=5 is safe, then I go down to y=4 at t=64.\n\nBut at t=63, y=5 is not occupied, so safe.\n\nThen I can go down.\n\nTo save one action, but I don't think so.\n\nPerhaps start by going down to y=3 or something, but that would take more turns to go back.\n\nFor example, t=60 D to y=3 at t=61, but y=3 is row 3, which has cars at t=70-73, but not at t=61, safe.\n\nBut then I need to go up to y=9, which takes more steps.\n\nFor instance, from y=3 to y=9, at least 6 steps, plus the down, so at least 7 actions, to reach at t=67 or something, but then I might have issues with row 4 at t=66, etc., but not necessarily faster.\n\nFor example: t=60 D to y=3 at t=61\n\nt=61 U to y=4 at t=62? Or stay.\n\nBut to minimize, go up.\n\nt=61 U to y=4 at t=62\n\nt=62 U to y=5 at t=63\n\nt=63 U to y=6 at t=64? But y=6 at t=64 occupied, cannot.\n\nt=63 D to y=5 at t=64? y=5 occupied.\n\nMust avoid.\n\nSo at t=63, need to be at y=4 or below.\n\nSay at t=62, y=4, then at t=62, choose S to y=4 at t=63, then at t=63 choose S to y=4 at t=64.\n\nThen from y=4 at t=64, go up as before.\n\nBut I started with down, so: t=60 D to y=3 at t=61\n\nt=61 U to y=4 at t=62\n\nt=62 S to y=4 at t=63? a_{62} S, y_{63}=4\n\nt=63 S to y=4 at t=64? a_{63} S, y_{64}=4\n\nThen same as before, t=64 U to y=5 at t=65, etc., to y=9 at t=69.\n\nBut I used an extra D at t=60, so more actions.\n\nWorse.\n\nThus, the first sequence seems efficient with H=9.\n\nBut in the first sequence, I used two D actions, but I reached at t=69.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 in fewer than 5 steps from y=4 at t=64, but no, 5 steps needed.\n\ny=4 to y=9, difference 5, so at least 5 up actions.\n\nIn the path, I have 7 up actions and 2 down actions, total 9 actions.\n\nIf I can have fewer downs or something.\n\nBut I think H=9 is minimal.\n\nNow, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have to avoid other obstacles, but in this case, after t=64, no issue until row 4 at t=66, but I am not on row 4.\n\nIn the path: after t=64, at t=65 y=5, t=66 y=6, t=67 y=7, t=68 y=8, t=69 y=9.\n\nNow, row 4 occupied at t=66,67,68, but I am on y=6,7,8, which are not row 4.\n\nRow 1-3 occupied at t=70-73, but I reach y=9 at t=69, before that.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nNow, the actions are for turns starting from t1=60.\n\nIn the sequence: actions at t=60 to t=68.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nWith H=9.\n\nNow, actions: a_{60} = U\n\na_{61} = U\n\na_{62} = D\n\na_{63} = D\n\na_{64} = U\n\na_{65} = U\n\na_{66} = U\n\na_{67} = U\n\na_{68} = U\n\nIn the sequence, at t=63, I have D, but let's confirm positions.\n\nTurn t=60: position y=4, choose a_{60}=U, so next position y=5 at t=61\n\nTurn t=61: position y=5, choose a_{61}=U, next y=6 at t=62\n\nTurn t=62: position y=6, choose a_{62}=D, next y=5 at t=63\n\nTurn t=63: position y=5, choose a_{63}=D, next y=4 at t=64\n\nTurn t=64: position y=4, choose a_{64}=U, next y=5 at t=65\n\nTurn t=65: position y=5, choose a_{65}=U, next y=6 at t=66\n\nTurn t=66: position y=6, choose a_{66}=U, next y=7 at t=67\n\nTurn t=67: position y=7, choose a_{67}=U, next y=8 at t=68\n\nTurn t=68: position y=8, choose a_{68}=U, next y=9 at t=69\n\nAt turn t=69, position y=9, reached.\n\nAll safe.\n\nI could have a different sequence, but this should work.\n\nNow, about freeway 4: in the car state, it has three cars, but we saw only one affects, and we avoided it.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nNow, H=9.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and H=9.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can do with H=8.\n\nSuppose H=8, then I reach at t=68.\n\ny_{68}=9.\n\nThen y_{67} must be 8 or 9.\n\ny_{67}=9 not possible.\n\ny_{67}=8.\n\nThen to have y_{67}=8, need y_{66}=7 or 8 or 9.\n\ny_{66} at t=66 not occupied for rows 7,8.\n\nNow, y_{66}=8 possible.\n\nBut how to get to y_{66}=8.\n\ny_{66}=8 requires y_{65} to be 7,8,9 with a_{65}.\n\ny_{65} at t=65 not occupied.\n\nBut y_{65}=7: requires y_{64} to be 6,7,8 with a_{64}.\n\nBut y_{64} at t=64 must not be occupied if freeway.\n\ny_{64}=6,7,8 all occupied at t=64.\n\nSo impossible to have y_{65}=7.\n\nSimilarly, y_{65}=8 impossible.\n\ny_{65}=6 also impossible.\n\nOnly y_{65}=4 or 5? But from there, to y_{66}=8 not possible in one step.\n\nThus cannot reach y_{67}=8, hence not y_{68}=9 with H=8.\n\nSimilarly for earlier.\n\nThus H=9 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1=60.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: D\n\nTurn 63: D\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write in the format.\n\nAlso, I need to specify H, but the answer is the sequence, and H is implied.\n\nThe output is the sequence of actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=63, I go down to y=4, but I could go down only once if I stay, but not necessary.\n\nAnother sequence: at t=60, I could go U to y=5\n\nt=61 U to y=6\n\nThen at t=62, instead of D, I could S to y=6 at t=63? Then at t=63 y=6, but then at t=63, I need to set y_{64}, if I choose D to y=5 at t=64, but y=5 occupied at t=64.\n\nIf I choose S, y=6 occupied.\n\nU to y=7 occupied.\n\nAll bad.\n\nSo I must leave row 6 at t=63 by going down to y=5.\n\nThen at t=63 y=5, go down to y=4.\n\nNo choice.\n\nThus, the sequence is fine.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 60\\) is 9. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by moving down to \\(y = 4\\) at turn \\(t = 64\\) when freeways \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are occupied, and then proceeding upward to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- At turn 60, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 5\\) at turn 61.\n- At turn 61, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 6\\) at turn 62.\n- At turn 62, move down (D) to reach \\(y = 5\\) at turn 63.\n- At turn 63, move down (D) to reach \\(y = 4\\) at turn 64.\n- At turn 64, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 5\\) at turn 65.\n- At turn 65, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 6\\) at turn 66.\n- At turn 66, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 7\\) at turn 67.\n- At turn 67, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 68.\n- At turn 68, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 69.\n\nThis sequence ensures that the player is not on any occupied freeway at any turn:\n- At turn 64, the player is at \\(y = 4\\), which is safe since freeway 4 is only occupied at turns 66–68.\n- Freeways 5–8 are occupied only at turn 64, and the player avoids them at that turn.\n- The path reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 69, which is safe as \\(y = 9\\) has no cars.\n\nNo shorter sequence is possible because:\n- Reaching \\(y = 9\\) by turn 68 would require being on freeways 5–8 at turn 64, which is occupied and causes collision.\n- The detour to avoid turn 64 adds necessary turns, making \\(H = 9\\) minimal.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 60: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 61: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 62: \\, D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 63: \\, D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 64: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 65: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 66: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 67: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 68: \\, U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and they move left or right with given speeds. Collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T and there's a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. The player is at y=6 at turn t1=62. I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe actions are U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same). y is from 0 to 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nThe goal is to minimize H, the number of turns, so I should try to move up as much as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nNow, let's list the cars on each freeway at turn t1=62.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head -24, tail -35, direction right, speed 3. Since it's right-moving, the span is [τ, h] = [-35, -24], I think. The notation says for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h], so tail to head, meaning from left to right increasing? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], and for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h]. But in the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor freeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 3). Since direction is right, head should be the right end, tail left end? But tail is -35, head is -24, so tail is smaller, head larger, so it's moving right, so at t1, it's from x= -35 to x= -24? But the span is given as (head, tail), but for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn this case, head = -24, tail = -35, so τ = -35, h = -24, so Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut we care about when 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nThe collision is only if at turn T, y_T is the freeway, and for some car on that freeway, 0 ∈ Span(T).\n\nAlso, note that when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I decide action to go to y_{T+1}, but during turn T, I'm on y_T, so I check collision with cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nAnd if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I don't care about cars there at turn T, only at future turns when I'm on that row.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when cars are present at x=0.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, I can find the times when a car covers x=0 for each freeway.\n\nBut there might be multiple cars per freeway.\n\nAlso, the player starts at y=6, needs to go to y=9. The freeways are from 1 to 8, and y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, no cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways with cars, only y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nSo at y=0 and y=9, no collision possible.\n\nBut I start at (0,6), which is on freeway y=6? y=6 is a freeway, but (0,6) is the position, and at turn t1, I'm on y=6, so I need to check if at turn t1, there is a car on y=6 with 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly for other turns.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars and their positions over time.\n\nDefine t as turns from t1=62 onwards.\n\nSo for a given freeway k, and car c on it, with initial head, tail, direction, speed at t1.\n\nThen at turn T (absolute turn), the span can be found.\n\nSince T > t1, and t1=62.\n\nFor any T >= t1, span at T.\n\nFirst, for right-moving car: initial span [τ, h] at t1, then at T, span [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\nIn this problem, all cars seem to be right-moving, from the table.\n\nLet me check:\n\nFreeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 3) → right-moving\n\nFreeway 2: same (-24, -35, right, 3) → right\n\nFreeway 3: same (-24, -35, right, 3) → right\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: (-16,-27,right,4), (20,9,right,4), (56,45,right,4) → all right\n\nFreeway 5: (48,37,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) → both right\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5: (48,37,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so that simplifies.\n\nNow for each car, at turn T, span is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] since right-moving.\n\nAnd 0 is in span if τ + s*(T-t1) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-t1)\n\nSince for right-moving, τ <= h, so the span is from τ to h, inclusive? I assume inclusive, since it says \"span\" and collision if 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly, the inequality should be with equality possible.\n\nNow, for a given freeway, if there is any car such that at turn T, 0 is in its span, then that freeway is occupied at turn T.\n\nOtherwise, it's safe to be on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, the player can only be on one freeway at a time, and moves vertically.\n\nI need to go from y=6 to y=9, so I need to move up to y=7,8,9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and since no cars there, once I reach y=9, I'm done, and no collision on y=9.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 has no cars, but I'm starting from 6, going to 9, so I won't go below.\n\nBut I might need to go down if blocked, but probably not, since I need to go up.\n\nMinimal turns, so moving up directly might be possible.\n\nBut let's see the car positions.\n\nFirst, t1=62.\n\nI need to find for each freeway and each turn T, whether it is occupied at T.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, I can find the time intervals when each freeway is occupied.\n\nBut multiple cars per freeway, so I need the union of occupied times for each freeway.\n\nLet's handle each freeway separately.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: only one car: τ = -35, h = -24, s=3, right.\n\nAt T, span [ -35 + 3*(T-62), -24 + 3*(T-62) ]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 3*(T-62) <= 0 <= -24 + 3*(T-62)\n\nSet Δt = T - t1 = T - 62\n\nSo -35 + 3*Δt <= 0 <= -24 + 3*Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -35 + 3Δt <= 0 => 3Δt <= 35 => Δt <= 35/3 ≈ 11.666, so Δt <= 11 since integer turns? T is integer, I assume turns are discrete.\n\nT is turn number, so integer.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -24 + 3Δt => 3Δt >= 24 => Δt >= 8\n\nAnd first: 3Δt <= 35, Δt <= 11 since 35/3=11.666, so Δt <=11\n\n3*11=33, -35+33= -2 <=0, yes\n\n3*12=36, -35+36=1 >0, not <=0? The inequality is -35 +3Δt <=0, which is 3Δt <=35, Δt<=11.666, so Δt<=11\n\nAt Δt=11: -35 +33= -2 <=0, and 0 <= -24 +33=9? -24+33=9, 0<=9 true.\n\n0 <=9 is true.\n\nNow at Δt=12: -35+36=1 <=0? 1 <=0 false, so first inequality false.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -24+36=12, true, but since first false, not both.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=8: -35+24= -11 <=0 true, 0 <= -24+24=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nSo for Δt from 8 to 11 inclusive.\n\nSo at T = t1 + Δt, for Δt=8,9,10,11, so T=70,71,72,73, freeway 1 is occupied.\n\nT=62 +8=70, up to 62+11=73.\n\nt1=62, T=62+Δt.\n\nΔt min 8, max 11, so T=70,71,72,73.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (-24,-35,right,3), so same, occupied at T=70,71,72,73.\n\nFreeway 3: same, occupied T=70,71,72,73.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-16,-27,right,4)\n\nτ = -27, h = -16? Given as (head, tail) = (-16,-27), so for right, head is -16, tail is -27, so τ = tail = -27, h = head = -16.\n\nSpan at T: [ -27 + 4*(T-62), -16 + 4*(T-62) ]\n\n0 in span: -27 +4Δt <=0 <= -16 +4Δt\n\nFirst: -27+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=27 => Δt <= 27/4=6.75, so Δt <=6\n\nSecond: 0 <= -16 +4Δt => 4Δt >=16 => Δt >=4\n\nAt Δt=4: -27+16= -11 <=0 true, 0 <= -16+16=0 true.\n\nΔt=5: -27+20= -7<=0, 0<= -16+20=4 true\n\nΔt=6: -27+24= -3<=0, 0<= -16+24=8 true\n\nΔt=7: -27+28=1 <=0 false? 1<=0 false, so not.\n\nSo car 1 on freeway 4 occupied Δt=4,5,6 → T=66,67,68\n\nT=62+4=66, 67,68\n\nSecond car on freeway 4: (20,9,right,4) head=20, tail=9? Given (20,9,right,4), so τ=9, h=20? Since right, span [τ,h] = [9,20] at t1.\n\nAt T: [9 +4*(T-62), 20 +4*(T-62)]\n\n0 in span: 9+4Δt <=0 <=20+4Δt\n\nBut 9+4Δt <=0? Since Δt>=0, 9+4Δt >=9>0, so left inequality false for all Δt, so 0 never in span for this car. Because the car is from x=9 to 20 at t1, moving right, so it will be at higher x, never covers x=0. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (56,45,right,4) head=56, tail=45, span [45,56] at t1, moving right, all positive, so 0 never covered. Safe.\n\nSo for freeway 4, only car 1 can cover x=0, at Δt=4,5,6, T=66,67,68.\n\nThus freeway 4 occupied only at T=66,67,68.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) τ=37, h=48? Given (48,37,right,12), so head=48, tail=37, so [37,48] at t1.\n\nAt T: [37 +12*(T-62), 48 +12*(T-62)]\n\n0 in span: 37+12Δt <=0 <=48+12Δt\n\n37+12Δt <=0? Since Δt>=0, min 37>0, so false, never <=0. So 0 not covered.\n\nSecond car: (-24,-35,right,12) head=-24, tail=-35, so τ=-35, h=-24.\n\nAt T: [ -35 +12*(T-62), -24 +12*(T-62) ]\n\n0 in span: -35 +12Δt <=0 <= -24 +12Δt\n\nFirst: -35+12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <=35 => Δt <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so Δt <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +12Δt => 12Δt >=24 => Δt >=2\n\nSo at Δt=2: -35+24= -11 <=0 true, 0 <= -24+24=0 true.\n\nΔt=1: -35+12= -23 <=0 true, but 0 <= -24+12= -12? 0 <= -12 false, so not.\n\nΔt=3: -35+36=1 <=0 false.\n\nSo only at Δt=2, T=62+2=64.\n\nThus freeway 5 occupied only at T=64 by this car.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5, two cars: (48,37,right,12) which never covers 0, and (-24,-35,right,12) which covers at Δt=2, T=64.\n\nSo occupied at T=64.\n\nFreeway 7: same, occupied at T=64.\n\nFreeway 8: same, occupied at T=64.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the turns when occupied:\n\nFreeway 1: T=70,71,72,73\n\nFreeway 2: same, 70,71,72,73\n\nFreeway 3: same, 70,71,72,73\n\nFreeway 4: T=66,67,68\n\nFreeway 5: T=64\n\nFreeway 6: T=64\n\nFreeway 7: T=64\n\nFreeway 8: T=64\n\nNow, freeway 4 is occupied at 66,67,68.\n\nI need to go from y=6 to y=9.\n\nAt turn t1=62, I am at y=6.\n\nNow, y=6 is freeway 6, which is occupied only at T=64.\n\nAt T=62, is freeway 6 occupied?\n\nAt T=62, Δt=0.\n\nFor freeway 6, at T=62, the car (-24,-35,right,12), span at t1: [-35,-24], 0 not in [-35,-24] since -35<=0<=-24? 0>=-24? -24 is negative, 0 > -24, so 0 not <= -24? The span is [τ, h] = [-35, -24], so x from -35 to -24 inclusive.\n\nIs 0 in this interval? -35 <= 0 <= -24? 0 <= -24 is false, since -24<0, so no, 0 not in [-35,-24].\n\nSimilarly, other car (48,37) not cover 0.\n\nSo at T=62, freeway 6 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways at t1.\n\nBut I need to plan the path.\n\nPlayer starts at y=6 at turn T=62.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn T.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nTo go from 6 to 9, minimum moves are 3 ups: U,U,U, but I might need to wait if blocked.\n\ny=6 to y=7, then to y=8, then to y=9.\n\nThe freeways I need to be on: when moving, I am on a freeway only when I am at that y position during a turn.\n\nFor example, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose action to set y_{T+1}.\n\nIf I choose S, I stay on same y.\n\nIf U or D, I move to adjacent y.\n\nNow, collision only when I am on a freeway y=1 to 8 at turn T, and that freeway is occupied at T.\n\ny=9 and y=0 have no cars, so always safe.\n\nAt turn T, if I am on y=9, no collision, similarly y=0.\n\nBut I start at y=6, which is freeway.\n\nNow, I need to be on y=6,7,8 at some turns, but avoid when occupied.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nTo minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut let's see the occupied times.\n\nFirst, freeway 6 (y=6) is occupied only at T=64.\n\nAt T=62, y=6 is safe, as we saw.\n\nAt T=63, what about y=6?\n\nI need to find for each turn, the occupation.\n\nSince I have the list, I can list for each relevant freeway and each turn from 62 onwards, if occupied.\n\nBut turns from 62 to, say, 80, but probably not that long.\n\nFirst, freeway 6: occupied only at T=64. So at T=62,63,65,... safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: y=7, occupied only at T=64, from above.\n\nFreeway 7 has same as 5 and 6, occupied at T=64.\n\nFreeway 7: from above, same as freeway 5,6,7,8 all occupied only at T=64.\n\nFreeway 7: we have freeway 7 cars: (48,37,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAt T=64, occupied, else not.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8 same.\n\nNow freeway 5: same.\n\nBut freeway 4: y=4, occupied at T=66,67,68.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3: y=1,2,3 occupied at T=70,71,72,73.\n\nNow I need to go through y=7 and y=8 to reach y=9.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are both occupied only at T=64.\n\nAt other times, they are safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 is safe except T=64.\n\nAt turn T=62, I am at y=6.\n\nI need to move to y=7, then to y=8, then to y=9.\n\nEach move takes one turn, but I can stay or move down, but that might increase turns.\n\nMinimum H=3 turns: from T=62 to T=64, but let's see.\n\nAt T=62, I am at y=6, safe.\n\nI choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I choose U at T=62, then at T=63, I move to y=7.\n\nBut at T=63, where am I?\n\nSequence:\n\nAt turn T=62: I am at position (0,6), so y_{62} =6.\n\nI choose action a_{62}, which determines y_{63}.\n\nThen at turn T=63, I am at y_{63}, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T if y_T is between 1 and 8, and freeway y_T is occupied at T.\n\nFor T=62: y_{62} =6, freeway 6 occupied? At T=62, as we saw, not occupied, so safe.\n\nNow, I need to get to y=9.\n\nSuppose I go up directly.\n\nIf at T=62, I choose U, then y_{63} = y_{62} +1 =7.\n\nThen at T=63, I am at y=7.\n\nNow, is freeway 7 occupied at T=63?\n\nFreeway 7: cars, at T=63, Δt = T-62 =1.\n\nFor car (-24,-35,right,12), span at T: [-35 +12*1, -24 +12*1] = [-23, -12], 0 not in this.\n\nOther car (48,37) not cover 0. So freeway 7 safe at T=63.\n\nThen, at T=63, I can choose action, say U, to go to y=8.\n\nThen y_{64} =8.\n\nNow at T=64, I am at y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 occupied? At T=64, yes, as per above.\n\nFreeway 8 occupied at T=64.\n\nSo if I am on y=8 at T=64, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf I choose S at T=63, stay at y=7, then at T=64, I am at y=7, and freeway 7 occupied at T=64, also collision.\n\nIf I choose D at T=63, go down to y=6, then at T=64, y=6 occupied, collision.\n\nSo no matter what I do at T=63, if I am at y=7 at T=63, then at T=64, I have to be somewhere, but y=6,7,8 all occupied at T=64.\n\ny=6,7,8 all have cars at T=64.\n\nSpecifically, freeway 6,7,8 all occupied at T=64.\n\nSo if I am on any of them at T=64, collision.\n\nBut at T=63, if I am at y=7, I must choose action for next.\n\nBut at T=64, all y=6,7,8 are occupied, so if I stay at 7, or move to 6 or 8, all occupied.\n\ny=8: at T=64, occupied.\n\ny=6: occupied.\n\ny=7: occupied.\n\nThe only safe y at T=64 are y=0,1,2,3,4,5,9? But y=1,2,3,4,5 might be safe or not.\n\ny=1,2,3: occupied only at T=70-73, not at 64.\n\ny=4: freeway 4, occupied at T=66,67,68, not at 64.\n\ny=5: freeway 5, occupied only at T=64? Freeway 5 is occupied at T=64.\n\nFreeway 5: y=5, occupied at T=64.\n\nSimilarly y=4 not occupied at T=64.\n\ny=3 not occupied, etc.\n\nAt T=64:\n\n- y=1: freeway 1, not occupied until 70, so safe\n\n- y=2: safe\n\n- y=3: safe\n\n- y=4: freeway 4, not occupied at 64 (occupied 66-68), so safe\n\n- y=5: freeway 5, occupied at 64, not safe\n\n- y=6: occupied, not safe\n\n- y=7: occupied, not safe\n\n- y=8: occupied, not safe\n\n- y=0 and y=9: safe\n\nSo at T=64, safe freeways: y=0,1,2,3,4,9\n\ny=5,6,7,8 unsafe.\n\nNow back to the plan.\n\nAt T=62, I am at y=6, safe.\n\nIf I go up to y=7 at T=63, then at T=63 I am at y=7, safe (since occupied only at 64).\n\nThen at T=63, I need to choose action for T=64.\n\nBut at T=64, if I stay at y=7, collision; go to y=6 or y=8, both collision.\n\nGo down to y=6? But y=6 occupied at T=64.\n\nOr go up to y=8, occupied.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=7 at T=63, because I cannot avoid collision at T=64 if I stay around.\n\nI need to leave the area before T=64 or go to a safe row.\n\nAt T=62, instead of going up, I could go down or stay.\n\nBut going down might not help, since I need to go up eventually.\n\nI could stay at y=6 for some turns.\n\nAt T=62, I can choose S, stay at y=6.\n\nThen at T=63, I am at y=6.\n\nNow at T=63, y=6 is safe? Freeway 6 at T=63: Δt=1, span for car: [-35+12*1, -24+12*1] = [-23,-12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen at T=63, I need to choose action.\n\nIf I go up to y=7, then at T=64, I am at y=7, which is occupied, collision.\n\nIf I stay at y=6, at T=64, y=6 occupied, collision.\n\nIf I go down to y=5, then at T=64, I am at y=5, which is freeway 5, occupied at T=64, collision.\n\nSo again, stuck.\n\nThe problem is that at T=64, all of y=5,6,7,8 are occupied, so if I am on any row from 5 to 8 at T=64, collision.\n\nTherefore, to avoid collision at T=64, I must be on y=0,1,2,3,4 or 9 at T=64.\n\nBut at T=62, I am at y=6.\n\nI need to get to a safe row by T=64.\n\nFrom T=62 to T=64, I have two actions: a_{62} and a_{63}.\n\ny_{63} = y_{62} + Δy_{62}\n\ny_{64} = y_{63} + Δy_{63}\n\nI start y_{62} =6.\n\nI need y_{64} to be in {0,1,2,3,4,9}\n\nSince y=9 is the goal, but I might not reach it yet.\n\nPossible moves.\n\nIf I move down twice: a_{62}=D, then y_{63}=5, then a_{63}=D, y_{64}=4.\n\ny=4 is safe at T=64.\n\nThen at T=64, I am at y=4, safe.\n\nThen I can proceed up later.\n\nBut this takes more turns.\n\nIf I move down once and stay or something.\n\nBut let's see the minimal path.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, I could go directly if possible, but from y=6 to y=9, I need to pass through y=7 and y=8, which are blocked at T=64.\n\nBut at other times, they might be free.\n\nFor example, after T=64, y=6,7,8 are safe again, until later times.\n\ny=6,7,8 are safe except at T=64.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 only at T=64 occupied.\n\ny=4 at 66-68 occupied, etc.\n\nBut for now, to reach y=9, I need to be on y=7 and y=8 at some safe turns.\n\nPossible to wait until after T=64.\n\nFor example, at T=62, I could stay or move to avoid T=64.\n\nBut from above, to be safe at T=64, I need to be at y<=4 or y=9 by T=64.\n\ny=9 is far, I can't reach in two turns from y=6: min 3 turns to y=9.\n\nFrom y=6, to y=9, need at least 3 moves up.\n\nBut from T=62 to T=64, only two turns, so I can reach at most y=8 if I go up twice.\n\ny_{62}=6\n\nIf a_{62}=U, y_{63}=7\n\na_{63}=U, y_{64}=8\n\nBut y=8 occupied at T=64.\n\nIf I go up once and down, etc., but not to y=9.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=9 by T=64 with two actions.\n\nThus, the only way to avoid collision at T=64 is to be at y<=4 at T=64.\n\nFor example, go down to y=4 or lower.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nBut this might take more turns.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, I could go there directly after some delay.\n\nBut let's list the safe times for each row.\n\nFirst, y=6: safe except at T=64\n\ny=7: safe except at T=64\n\ny=8: safe except at T=64\n\ny=5: safe except at T=64\n\ny=4: safe except at T=66,67,68\n\ny=3: safe except at T=70,71,72,73\n\nSimilarly y=2,1.\n\nNow, I need to be on y=7 at some turn when it is safe, and similarly for y=8.\n\nSince I have to be on each row during the move.\n\nFor example, to go from y=6 to y=7, I must be at y=7 at some turn, and similarly.\n\nThe sequence of positions.\n\nI start at T=62, y=6.\n\nI need to end at some T, y=9.\n\nThe path must include being on y=7 and y=8 at some points.\n\nFor instance, if I go directly, I am on y=7 at T=63 if I move up at T=62, etc.\n\nBut at T=64, all middle rows are dangerous.\n\nSo I need to be not on y=5,6,7,8 at T=64.\n\nTherefore, for turn T=64, I must be on y=0,1,2,3,4 or 9.\n\nBut y=9 not reachable in two moves, so must be on y<=4.\n\nNow, from y=6 at T=62, to y<=4 at T=64.\n\nWith two actions.\n\ny_{62}=6\n\ny_{63} = y_{62} + Δy_{62} , |Δy| <=1\n\ny_{64} = y_{63} + Δy_{63}\n\ny_{64} <=4\n\nSince y_{62}=6, to get to y_{64}<=4, I need to decrease by at least 2.\n\nSo I must move down at least twice.\n\nFor example:\n\nOption: a_{62}=D, then y_{63}=5\n\nThen a_{63}=D, y_{64}=4\n\ny=4 is safe at T=64.\n\na_{62}=D, y_{63}=5, then a_{63}=S, y_{64}=5, but y=5 occupied at T=64, not safe.\n\na_{62}=D, y_{63}=5, then a_{63}=U, y_{64}=6, occupied.\n\na_{62}=S, y_{63}=6, then a_{63}=D, y_{64}=5, occupied.\n\na_{62}=S, y_{63}=6, then a_{63}=S, y_{64}=6, occupied.\n\na_{62}=U, y_{63}=7, then a_{63}=D, y_{64}=6, occupied.\n\nAll lead to y_{64} in {5,6,7} if I don't go down twice.\n\nIf I go down twice: a_{62}=D, y_{63}=5; a_{63}=D, y_{64}=4.\n\ny=4 safe at T=64.\n\nI could go to y=3, but not necessary.\n\nSo minimal is to go to y=4 at T=64.\n\nThen at T=64, I am at y=4, safe.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=4 to y=9, need 5 moves up, but I can do it in 5 turns if no obstacles.\n\nBut there are obstacles: y=4 occupied at T=66,67,68.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 safe except at T=64, which is past.\n\nT=64 is over, now we are at T=64, y=4.\n\nNow from here, I need to go up.\n\ny=4 is occupied at T=66,67,68, so I need to avoid being on y=4 at those turns.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nBut first, let's list the turns from T=64 onwards.\n\nAt T=64, y=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe path: I need to be on y=5,6,7,8 at some safe turns.\n\ny=5: safe except T=64, which is past, so always safe now.\n\ny=6: safe except T=64, past, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=7 and y=8 safe except T=64, past.\n\ny=4 unsafe at T=66,67,68.\n\nNow, at T=64, I am at y=4.\n\nIf I stay, y_{65}=4 if S, but at T=65, is y=4 occupied?\n\nFreeway 4 occupied at T=66,67,68, not at 65.\n\nAt T=65, Δt = T-62=3, freeway 4: car 1, Δt=3, -27+4*3= -27+12= -15 <=0? For freeway 4, occupied at T=66,67,68 which is Δt=4,5,6.\n\nΔt=T-62.\n\nT=65, Δt=3, freeway 4: car, -27+4*3= -27+12= -15 <=0, and 0 <= -16+12= -4? 0 <= -4 false, so not occupied. Similarly other cars no, so safe at T=65.\n\nSimilarly, T=66: Δt=4, -27+16= -11<=0, 0<= -16+16=0, true, occupied.\n\nSo y=4 safe at T=64,65, but not 66,67,68.\n\nAt T=64, I can choose to stay or move up.\n\nIf I move up immediately: at T=64, I am at y=4, choose action.\n\nIf I choose U, then y_{65}=5.\n\nAt T=65, I am at y=5.\n\ny=5 is safe at all times except T=64, past.\n\nThen at T=65, I can choose U again, y_{66}=6.\n\nAt T=66, I am at y=6.\n\ny=6 is safe, since occupied only at 64, past.\n\nThen at T=66, choose U, y_{67}=7.\n\nT=67, y=7, safe.\n\nU, y_{68}=8, T=68, y=8, safe.\n\nThen U, y_{69}=9, T=69, y=9, done.\n\nBut at T=66, I am on y=6, but y=6 is safe, yes.\n\nThe problem is that I need to be on y=7 and y=8, but in this path, at T=67 and T=68, I am on y=7 and y=8, which are safe.\n\nBut let's check if at any point I am on a row when occupied.\n\nT=64: y=4, safe\n\nT=65: y=5, safe\n\nT=66: y=6, safe (since T=64 past)\n\nT=67: y=7, safe\n\nT=68: y=8, safe\n\nT=69: y=9, safe, goal.\n\nBut at T=66,67,68, freeway 4 is occupied, but I am not on y=4 at those times, I am on y=6,7,8, which are fine.\n\ny=4 occupied, but I am not there.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nAnd I reach y=9 at T=69.\n\nNow, what is H? From start to end.\n\nStart at turn t1=62, position at T=62.\n\nAfter H turns, I am at y_{t1 + H -1} =9? Let's see the indexing.\n\nThe player position: at turn T, position (0, y_T)\n\nAfter actions from t=0 to H-1, meaning actions at turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nAt turn T, we have position y_T.\n\nAction a_T is chosen at turn T, which sets y_{T+1}.\n\nThe sequence: start at turn T=62, y_{62}=6.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{62}, y_{63}, ..., up to y_{62 + H}, but the last position is after H actions.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", so actions from t=0 to H-1, meaning a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}\n\nThen after these actions, the position is at turn t1 + H, I think.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9)\" means that at some turn, y_T =9 for T = t1 + H -1? The indexing is a bit messy.\n\nIt says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nIn the task: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nYes: \"minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nSo the position at turn t1 + H -1 is (0,9).\n\nNow, the actions are from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions at t1, and y_{t1 +1 -1} = y_{t1} should be 9, but at start y=6≠9, so H>=3 min.\n\nIn general, after k actions, the position is at turn t1 + k.\n\nStart: at turn t1, position y_{t1}\n\nAfter first action a_{t1}, position y_{t1+1}\n\nAfter second action a_{t1+1}, position y_{t1+2}\n\n...\n\nAfter the last action, which is the (H)-th action, at turn t1 + H -1, we set y_{t1 + H}\n\nBut the condition is that at turn t1 + H -1, y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe position at the turn when we perform the action.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T, and we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nWe want that at turn T = t1 + H -1, y_T =9.\n\nAnd we have performed actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2}? No.\n\nThe actions sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, meaning a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor t=0: a_{t1}, chosen at turn t1, sets y_{t1+1}\n\nt=1: a_{t1+1}, at turn t1+1, sets y_{t1+2}\n\n...\n\nt=H-1: a_{t1 + H -1}, at turn t1 + H -1, sets y_{t1 + H}\n\nBut the position at turn t1 + H -1 is y_{t1 + H -1}, and we want this to be 9.\n\nWhen we are at turn t1 + H -1, we have position y_{t1 + H -1}, and we choose action a_{t1 + H -1}, but the position before action is y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nAnd we want this position to be (0,9).\n\nAfter that action, we move to y_{t1 + H}, but we don't care, as long as at that turn we are at 9.\n\nIn this case, for the sequence, we need to specify actions up to the turn before we reach 9, or including?\n\nIn the answer format, it shows actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., until the action that sets to 9 or something.\n\nLet's see the format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t1}\" up to the last action.\n\nBut in the condition, y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so at turn t1 + H -1, we are at y=9.\n\nNow, to reach there, we must have arrived at an earlier turn or stayed.\n\nThe actions before determine how we get there.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at turn T, we could have moved there from y=8 at turn T-1 by action U, or stayed if already there.\n\nBut since we start at y=6, we need to move.\n\nIn this case, for our path, we want to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nIn my earlier plan, I had at T=69, y=9.\n\nT=69 is t1 + H -1? t1=62, so t1 + H -1 =69, so 62 + H -1 =69, thus H-1=7, H=8.\n\n62 + H -1 =69, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nActions from a_{62} to a_{62+7} = a_{69}? Let's index.\n\nt1 + H -1 =69, t1=62, so 62 + H -1 =69, thus H-1=7, H=8.\n\nThe actions are a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1} = a_{62} to a_{69}\n\nBut at turn t1 + H -1 =69, position y_{69}=9.\n\nIn the sequence, action a_{69} is chosen at turn 69, which sets y_{70}, but since we are already at y=9, if we choose S or U, but y=9, U not possible, so probably S.\n\nBut the position at turn 69 is y_{69}=9, before action.\n\nAfter action a_{69}, y_{70} might be different, but we don't care.\n\nIn the action sequence, we include a_{69} as well.\n\nBut in the minimal path, we can choose to stay or something.\n\nBut in this case, with H=8, we reach at turn 69.\n\nBut perhaps we can do better.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the path I thought.\n\nStart T=62, y=6\n\nTo avoid T=64, we go down.\n\nIn the path: at T=62, action: D, so y_{63} = y_{62} + (-1) =5? Action D, Δy = -1, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\na_t = D, y_{t+1} = y_t -1\n\nSimilarly U: +1, S:0.\n\nSo at T=62, choose a_{62} = D, then y_{63} =6 -1=5\n\nThen at T=63, y=5, choose a_{63} = D, then y_{64} =5 -1=4\n\nAt T=64, y=4, safe.\n\nThen at T=64, choose a_{64} = U, then y_{65} =4+1=5\n\nAt T=65, y=5, choose a_{65} = U, y_{66} =5+1=6\n\nAt T=66, y=6, choose a_{66} = U, y_{67} =6+1=7\n\nAt T=67, y=7, choose a_{67} = U, y_{68} =7+1=8\n\nAt T=68, y=8, choose a_{68} = U, y_{69} =8+1=9\n\nAt T=69, y=9, which is t1 + H -1 =62 + H -1=69, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nAnd y=9, goal.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nT=62: y=6, freeway 6 not occupied, safe\n\nT=63: y=5, freeway 5 not occupied at T=63? T=63, Δt=1, freeway 5 car: (-24,-35,right,12), span [-35+12, -24+12]=[-23,-12], 0 not in; other car not, so safe.\n\nT=64: y=4, freeway 4 not occupied at T=64, as earlier, safe.\n\nT=65: y=5, safe (only occupied at 64)\n\nT=66: y=6, safe (only at 64)\n\nT=67: y=7, safe\n\nT=68: y=8, safe\n\nT=69: y=9, safe, no cars.\n\nAll safe.\n\nBut is this minimal H? H=8.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster.\n\nFor example, if I don't go down, can I reach earlier?\n\nSuppose at T=62, I go up to y=7 at T=63.\n\nThen at T=63, y=7, safe.\n\nBut at T=64, I need to be not on y=5-8.\n\nBut I can only move to adjacent, so from y=7, at T=63, I can go to y=6,7,8, all unsafe at T=64.\n\nUnless I go down to y=6, but same.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to y=4 directly, but I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nFrom y=7, I can only go to y=6,7,8.\n\nNo way to escape to y=4 in one move.\n\nAt T=63, I am at y=7, I must choose action for T=64.\n\nBut all choices lead to y=6,7, or 8, all occupied at T=64.\n\nSo collision inevitable if I am at y=7 at T=63.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay at y=6 at T=63, same issue.\n\nOnly by moving down to y=5 or lower at T=63, but y=5 at T=64 occupied.\n\nSo the only safe way is to be at y<=4 at T=64.\n\nThus, going down is necessary.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach y=9 earlier than T=69.\n\nFor example, after T=64, I can go up faster.\n\nIn the path, I went to y=4 at T=64, then up step by step to y=9 at T=69.\n\nTotal turns from start: from T=62 to T=69, 8 turns, but H is the number of actions? H is such that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nt1=62, at turn 69, which is 62+7, so t1 +7 =69, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nActions from 62 to 69? a_{62} to a_{69}, but a_{69} is at turn 69, which sets y_{70}, but we are at y_{69}=9 before action.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions a_{62} to a_{69}, but a_{69} might be redundant if we are already at 9, but we need to specify the action at turn 69 to stay or something, but since we reach at turn 69, we can choose S.\n\nBut in terms of H, it is 8.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at an earlier turn.\n\nFor example, if I could be at y=9 at T=65 or something, but from y=6, min 3 turns, but with T=64 block, I can't reach before T=64.\n\nEarliest possible: if no cars, I could be at y=9 at T=65: T=62, U to y=7 at T=63; U to y=8 at T=64; U to y=9 at T=65. But at T=64, y=8 occupied, so not possible.\n\nNext, T=66: but to be at y=9 at T=66.\n\ny_{66}=9.\n\nThen at T=65, I must be at y=8 or y=9.\n\nIf at y=8 at T=65, then action U to y=9 at T=66.\n\nBut at T=65, y=8 is safe? Yes, since occupied only at 64.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at T=65, I need to be at y=7 or y=8 at T=64? But at T=64, y=7 and y=8 occupied, so I cannot be there.\n\nTo be at y=8 at T=65, I must have been at y=7,8, or9 at T=64 and chosen action.\n\nBut at T=64, if I am at y=7, I can go U to y=8, but at T=64, if I am at y=7, which is occupied, collision at T=64.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=8 at T=64, occupied.\n\nIf at y=9, but not possible.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=8 at T=65, because I cannot be on y=7 or y=8 at T=64 without collision.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=9 at T=66, I need to be at y=8 or y=9 at T=65.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at T=65, I need to have moved from somewhere.\n\nAt T=64, I must be at a safe row, say y=4, and then move up.\n\nFor example, at T=64, y=4, as before.\n\nThen if I go up as fast as possible:\n\nT=64: y=4, choose U, y_{65}=5\n\nT=65: y=5, choose U, y_{66}=6\n\nBut we want y_{66}=9? Not possible, y=6 to 9 in one turn? No, max change 1.\n\nAt T=65, y=5, to reach y=9 at T=66, I need to go up 4 steps, impossible.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=9 is after moving up from lower.\n\nFrom y=4 at T=64, I can go:\n\nT=64: U, y_{65}=5\n\nT=65: U, y_{66}=6\n\nT=66: U, y_{67}=7\n\nT=67: U, y_{68}=8\n\nT=68: U, y_{69}=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt T=66, if I am at y=6, but y=6 is safe at T=66.\n\nBut to reach y=9, still need three more turns.\n\nPerhaps start from higher.\n\nBut I have to go through the rows.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are safe after T=64, I can go to them later.\n\nBut I need to be on them to move up.\n\nAnother idea: at T=62, instead of going down, I go up to y=7 at T=63, but then before T=64, I go down to y=4 or something, but I have only one action between.\n\nAt T=63, from y=7, I can only go to y=6,7,8, all unsafe at T=64.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I stay at y=6 until after T=64, but at T=64 I must leave.\n\nBut I can't.\n\nSo I think going down to y=4 is necessary.\n\nBut y=4 is occupied later at T=66-68, but in the path, I leave y=4 before that.\n\nIn the path above, I am at y=4 only at T=64 and T=65? In the sequence: at T=64, y=4; then U to y=5 at T=65.\n\nAt T=65, y=5, not y=4.\n\ny=4 only at T=64.\n\nThen T=65 y=5, etc.\n\ny=4 occupied at T=66,67,68, but I am not there, so fine.\n\nCan I save a turn?\n\nSuppose I go to y=3 at T=64.\n\nBut y=3 is safe, but farther down, then I need more moves up.\n\nFor example, at T=62, D to y=5; T=63, D to y=4? But at T=63, if I go D to y=4, then y_{64}=4.\n\nBut earlier: a_{62}=D, y_{63}=5; then a_{63}=D, y_{64}=4, same as before.\n\nIf I go directly to y=4 at T=63? No, from y=6, to y=4 in one move? No, must go through y=5.\n\nMin two downs to y=4.\n\nThen from y=4 to y=9, min 5 ups, so total min 7 actions, but positions from T=62 to T=69, H=8 as above.\n\nWith actions: actions at T=62 to T=68 to reach y=9 at T=69? Let's see.\n\nTo have y_{T} =9 at T.\n\nWith actions starting from T=62.\n\nIf I can reach y=9 at T=68, for example.\n\nThen y_{68}=9.\n\nNeed to be at y=8 or y=9 at T=67.\n\nAt T=67, y=7 or8 or9.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at T=67, I need to be on y=7 or8 at T=66.\n\nNow, T=66: freeway 4 occupied, but y=7 and y=8 are freeway 7 and 8, not 4.\n\nFreeway 4 is y=4.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are safe at T=66.\n\nSimilarly, at T=67, y=7 and y=8 safe.\n\nNow, can I be at y=8 at T=67?\n\nFor that, at T=66, I must be at y=7 or y=8 or y=9.\n\nIf at y=7 at T=66, action U to y=8 at T=67.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut how to be at y=7 at T=66.\n\nI need to come from below.\n\nBut at T=64, I am at y=4, say.\n\nThen T=64: y=4, U to y=5 at T=65\n\nT=65: y=5, U to y=6 at T=66\n\nAt T=66, y=6, not y=7.\n\nTo be at y=7 at T=66, I need at T=65 to be at y=6 or7 and go U or S.\n\nBut at T=65, if I am at y=6, go U to y=7 at T=66.\n\nBut to be at y=6 at T=65, from T=64 y=4, I need to go to y=5 at T=65, then to y=6 at T=66, so at T=65 I am at y=5, not y=6.\n\nFrom T=64 y=4:\n\n- Action at T=64: U, y_{65}=5\n\n- At T=65: U, y_{66}=6\n\n- At T=66: U, y_{67}=7\n\n- At T=67: U, y_{68}=8\n\n- At T=68: U, y_{69}=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf at T=64, I go U to y=5, then at T=65, I go U to y=6, T=66 y=6, then U to y=7 at T=67, etc.\n\nNo faster.\n\nAfter T=64, I can go up faster, but I have to go through each row.\n\nUnless I start from higher at beginning.\n\nBut I cannot because of T=64.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 before T=69 by taking a different path, but I don't see how.\n\nAnother thought: since y=9 is safe, and I need to be there, but I have to move through the rows.\n\nMinimal H is 8, I think.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can be at y=9 at an earlier turn with H smaller.\n\nSuppose H=7, then y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{62+7-1}=y_{68}=9.\n\nSo at T=68, y=9.\n\nThen I need to reach y=9 by T=68.\n\nNow, from start, at T=62, y=6.\n\nI need to go to y=9 in 6 actions? From T=62 to T=68, positions y_{62} to y_{68}.\n\ny_{68}=9.\n\nThe changes: net change +3, from 6 to 9.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1, so min 3 ups, but I can have downs and ups, but net +3, so at least 3 ups, and possibly some downs and stays, but that would increase H, so for min H, I should have only ups, but with obstacles.\n\nWith the car at T=64, I need to detour.\n\nIn the detour, I went down to y=4, which is 2 down, then up to y=9, 5 up, total actions 7, but positions: start y_{62}=6, after 7 actions: y_{69}=9, with y_{68}=8.\n\nIf I want y_{68}=9, that means I reach at T=68.\n\nWith actions from a_{62} to a_{67}, since actions up to a_{t1 + H -1} for H=7, a_{62} to a_{62+6}=a_{68}? t1 + H -1 =62+7-1=68, position at T=68.\n\nActions: a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1} = a_{62} to a_{68}\n\na_{62} to a_{68}, that's 7 actions.\n\nNow, to have y_{68}=9.\n\ny_{62}=6\n\nAfter a_{62}, y_{63} =6 + Δy\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{67}, y_{68} = y_{67} + Δy\n\ny_{68} must be 9.\n\nSince y_{62}=6, to y_{68}=9, net +3 in 6 steps? From y_{62} to y_{68}, there are 6 actions determining y_{63} to y_{68}.\n\ny_{63} to y_{68} are set by actions.\n\ny_{62} is initial.\n\nAfter k actions, y_{t1 + k}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9\n\nFor H=7, y_{62+6} = y_{68} =9\n\nThe actions a_{62} to a_{67} set y_{63} to y_{68}.\n\ny_{68} is set by a_{67} from y_{67}.\n\nTo have y_{68}=9, must have y_{67}=8 or 9, and action U or S.\n\nSimilarly, y_{67} must be set from previous.\n\nNow, constraints.\n\nTo avoid T=64, I need y_{64} <=4 or 9, but y=9 not reachable, so y_{64} <=4.\n\ny_{64} must be <=4.\n\ny_{62}=6\n\ny_{63} = y_{62} + Δy_{62}\n\ny_{64} = y_{63} + Δy_{63}\n\ny_{64} <=4\n\nSince y_{62}=6, y_{64} <=4, so y_{63} must be <=5, but y_{64} = y_{63} + Δy <= y_{63} +1, and <=4, so y_{63} <=4? Not necessarily, if y_{63}=5, then y_{64} <=4 only if Δy_{63} <= -1, so D.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut minimally, to have y_{64} <=4, with y_{62}=6, I need at least two downs, so y_{63} <=5 and y_{64} <=4.\n\nFor example, y_{63}=5, y_{64}=4 or less.\n\ny_{64} <=4.\n\nNow, for y_{68}=9.\n\ny_{64} <=4, say y_{64}=4\n\nThen from y=4 to y=9, min 5 ups.\n\nBut from T=64 to T=68, I have 4 actions: a_{64} to a_{67}, setting y_{65} to y_{68}.\n\ny_{65} to y_{68} set by a_{64} to a_{67}.\n\nWith y_{64} <=4, and y_{68}=9.\n\nNet change to y_{68} from y_{64} is at least +5, but in 4 steps, max increase 4, so y_{68} <= y_{64} +4 <= 4+4=8 <9, cannot reach y=9.\n\nIf y_{64}=3, then y_{68} <=3+4=7<9.\n\nWorse.\n\nThus impossible to reach y=9 at T=68 if y_{64} <=4.\n\nSimilarly, for any y_{64} <=4, y_{68} <= y_{64} +4 <=8<9.\n\nSo cannot reach at T=68.\n\nSimilarly, for T=67: y_{67}=9, but y_{64} <=4, y_{67} <= y_{64} +3 <=7<9.\n\nImpossible.\n\nT=66: y_{66}=9, y_{64} <=4, y_{66} <= y_{64} +2 <=6<9.\n\nNo.\n\nT=65: y_{65}=9, but from y_{62}=6, in 3 actions to y_{65}, max y=9 only if all U, but at T=64 y=8 occupied, cannot.\n\nThus, the earliest possible is T=69, with H=8.\n\nAnd we have a path.\n\nBut in the path, I used two downs and five ups, but with stays? No, in the sequence, I have two downs and then five ups, but the actions: from T=62 to T=68, actions: D,D,U,U,U,U,U\n\nThen at T=69, y=9, but we need action at T=69? For the sequence.\n\nIn the action sequence for H=8, actions a_{62} to a_{69}, but at T=69, we are at y=9, so we choose S or something, but it is included.\n\nIn the sequence I have:\n\nT=62: D\n\nT=63: D\n\nT=64: U\n\nT=65: U\n\nT=66: U\n\nT=67: U\n\nT=68: U  // this sets y_{69}=8+1=9\n\nThen at T=69, position y_{69}=9, which is t1+H-1=62+8-1=69.\n\nNow, we need to specify action at T=69: since we are at y=9, we can choose S, or if we choose U, but y=9, cannot go up, so must choose S or D, but D to y=8, not good. So choose S to stay.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to include it, I think.\n\nThe action sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, for H=8, a_{62} to a_{69}.\n\nAt T=69, we choose a_{69}, but since y_{69}=9, we set y_{70}, but we don't care, so we can choose S.\n\nIn the answer, we list the actions.\n\nBut for the path, with H=8, it works.\n\nPerhaps I can reduce by not going all the way to y=4.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=3 or something, but that might take more moves.\n\nOr, since y=4 is safe at T=65, I could stay, but not necessary.\n\nAnother idea: at T=62, I go down to y=5, but at T=64 y=5 occupied, so I must not be at y=5 at T=64.\n\nSo I need y_{64} <=4.\n\ny=4 is the highest safe row at T=64 besides y=9.\n\ny=4 is safe.\n\nCould I go to y=3? But farther, so more moves up.\n\nFor example, a_{62}=D, y_{63}=5; a_{63}=D, y_{64}=4; same as before.\n\nIf a_{62}=D, y_{63}=5; then a_{63}=D, y_{64}=4.\n\nIf I go a_{62}=D, y_{63}=5; a_{63}=S, y_{64}=5, but y=5 occupied at T=64, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo must go to y=4 or lower.\n\nThus, the path is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, when I go up, at T=66, I am at y=6, and freeway 4 is occupied, but I am not on y=4, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can go up faster after.\n\nBut no.\n\nSo minimal H is 8.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions.\n\nStart at t1=62.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 62: D  // to y=5\n\nBut action D at turn 62, sets y_{63}=6-1=5\n\nThen turn 63: D  // to y=4, sets y_{64}=5-1=4\n\nTurn 64: U  // to y=5, sets y_{65}=4+1=5\n\nTurn 65: U  // to y=6, sets y_{66}=5+1=6\n\nTurn 66: U  // to y=7, sets y_{67}=6+1=7\n\nTurn 67: U  // to y=8, sets y_{68}=7+1=8\n\nTurn 68: U  // to y=9, sets y_{69}=8+1=9\n\nThen at turn 69, position y_{69}=9, so we need action at turn 69.\n\nTurn 69: S  // stay, sets y_{70}=9, but not necessary, but we have to specify.\n\nIn the sequence, for t from 0 to H-1, H=8, so actions a_{62} to a_{69}.\n\na_{69} is at turn 69.\n\nSince we are at y=9, we choose S.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if y_T between 1 and 8, and freeway occupied.\n\nIn this path, at no turn is y_T on an occupied freeway.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nT=62: y=6, not occupied\n\nT=63: y=5, not occupied (Δt=1, freeway 5: [-23,-12], not cover 0)\n\nT=64: y=4, not occupied (freeway 4 at T=64: Δt=2, -27+8= -19? Earlier for freeway 4, occupied only at Δt=4,5,6. T=64, Δt=2, -27+4*2= -27+8= -19 <=0, 0 <= -16+8= -8? 0 <= -8 false, so not occupied)\n\nT=65: y=5, not occupied\n\nT=66: y=6, not occupied\n\nT=67: y=7, not occupied\n\nT=68: y=8, not occupied\n\nT=69: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 4, there is a car that might be at x=0, but in this case not at those turns.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut the problem has freeways 1,2,3 occupied later, but I don't go there, so fine.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nTurn t_1: D  // t1=62, action D\n\nTurn t_1 +1: D  // 63, D\n\nTurn t_1 +2: U  // 64, U\n\nTurn t_1 +3: U  // 65, U\n\nTurn t_1 +4: U  // 66, U\n\nTurn t_1 +5: U  // 67, U\n\nTurn t_1 +6: U  // 68, U\n\nTurn t_1 +7: S  // 69, S\n\nH=8, so t from 0 to 7.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be from turn t_1 to the last action.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can avoid going down, but I think not.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 directly without detour, but not possible.\n\nAnother thought: since at T=64, if I am on y=9, but I can't reach.\n\nOr, I could be on y=4 at T=64, but instead of going up step by step, I stay or something, but no benefit.\n\nSo I think H=8 is minimal.\n\nThus the sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 62\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 8. The sequence of actions must ensure that the player is not on a freeway row when it is occupied by a car at x=0 during the same turn.\n\n### Analysis of Car Occupancy\nThe cars move right with constant speeds, and their positions at any turn \\(T \\geq 62\\) can be computed. The freeways are occupied (i.e., a car covers x=0) at the following turns:\n- Freeway 1 (y=1): Occupied at T=70, 71, 72, 73\n- Freeway 2 (y=2): Occupied at T=70, 71, 72, 73\n- Freeway 3 (y=3): Occupied at T=70, 71, 72, 73\n- Freeway 4 (y=4): Occupied at T=66, 67, 68\n- Freeway 5 (y=5): Occupied at T=64\n- Freeway 6 (y=6): Occupied at T=64\n- Freeway 7 (y=7): Occupied at T=64\n- Freeway 8 (y=8): Occupied at T=64\n\nAt turn T=64, freeways y=5,6,7,8 are all occupied, making it unsafe to be on these rows. To avoid collision, the player must be on a safe row (y=0,1,2,3,4, or 9) at T=64. Since y=9 is not reachable by T=64 from y=6 (minimum 3 up moves required), the player must move down to y=4 or below by T=64.\n\n### Path to Reach y=9\n- Start at y=6 at turn 62.\n- Move down to y=5 at turn 63 (action D at turn 62).\n- Move down to y=4 at turn 64 (action D at turn 63). At T=64, y=4 is safe.\n- Then move up step by step: to y=5 at turn 65 (U), y=6 at turn 66 (U), y=7 at turn 67 (U), y=8 at turn 68 (U), and finally to y=9 at turn 69 (U at turn 68).\n- At turn 69, the player is at y=9, so the action is S (stay) to remain at y=9.\n\nThis path avoids all occupied freeways:\n- Turn 62 (y=6): Safe (not occupied at T=62)\n- Turn 63 (y=5): Safe (not occupied at T=63)\n- Turn 64 (y=4): Safe (not occupied at T=64)\n- Turn 65 (y=5): Safe (occupation only at T=64)\n- Turn 66 (y=6): Safe (occupation only at T=64)\n- Turn 67 (y=7): Safe (occupation only at T=64)\n- Turn 68 (y=8): Safe (occupation only at T=64)\n- Turn 69 (y=9): Safe (no cars)\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 8, as \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{69} = 9\\) for \\(t_1 = 62\\).\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe actions are for turns \\(t_1 + t\\) where \\(t\\) ranges from 0 to \\(H-1 = 7\\):\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 62: D \\\\\nTurn 63: D \\\\\nTurn 64: U \\\\\nTurn 65: U \\\\\nTurn 66: U \\\\\nTurn 67: U \\\\\nTurn 68: U \\\\\nTurn 69: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 4) on turn t_1 = 64. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollisions happen only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where there's a car such that 0 is in the car's span at that exact turn. Importantly, when the player moves to a new y-position, they are not on that new row until the next turn. So, if at turn T, the player is on y_T, and they move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, they won't be on y_{T+1} at turn T, so they avoid any collision that might happen on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states for each freeway. I need to figure out for each freeway and each car, when 0 is in their span, meaning when the car covers the x=0 position at a given turn.\n\nThe car spans move based on their direction and speed. Left-moving cars have head at h and tail at τ, with h > τ I assume, but from the update, for left-moving, span goes from h to τ, and h - s(T-t1) to τ - s(T-t1). Similarly for right-moving, it's from τ to h, and τ + s(T-t1) to h + s(T-t1).\n\nIn the table, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). But direction specifies left or right, and the head and tail are defined accordingly.\n\nFor example, on freeway 1: (-18, -29, right, 3). Direction is right, so for right-moving cars, the span is [tail, head], I think? Let's see the update.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, Span(t1) is given as [τ, h], which suggests that τ is the left end and h is the right end, since it moves right, increasing.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, [h, τ] with h decreasing.\n\nBut in the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed). What do head and tail mean?\n\nFor freeway 1: (-18, -29, right, 3). Since direction is right, and for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-29, -18], I think? But -29 is less than -18, so if τ = -29, h = -18, then [τ, h] = [-29, -18], which is from left to right.\n\nThen at time T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-29 + 3(T-64), -18 + 3(T-64)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, for the freeway y_T, 0 is in some car's span on that freeway.\n\nThat is, for a car on freeway k, if y_T = k, and 0 ∈ Span(T) for that car.\n\nSpan(T) is an interval, so 0 is covered if min(Span) ≤ 0 ≤ max(Span).\n\nSince for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], so min is τ + s(T-t1), max is h + s(T-t1).\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, min is h - s(T-t1), max is τ - s(T-t1)? From [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)], but since h > τ for left-moving, min is τ - s(T-t1), max is h - s(T-t1)? Let's clarify.\n\nAssume that for a car, head and tail are such that for the direction, head is the leading part.\n\nBut in the update, it's consistent.\n\nFor simplicity, I should compute for each car and each turn, whether 0 is covered.\n\nBut since t1 is 64, and we need to find actions from t=64 onwards, so T >= 64.\n\nLet me define the current turn as t = 0 for simplicity, to make calculations easier. So set t1 = 64 as time 0.\n\nSo at time t=0 (turn 64), player at y=4.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn H, so at time t=H, y=9, but since actions start from t=0, and after H actions, at time t=H, position is after H steps.\n\nTurn t1 + t for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nAt turn T = t1 + t, for t=0,1,2,...,H-1.\n\nAt the start of turn t1 + t, position is (0, y_{t1 + t}), and action a_{t1 + t} is taken, then position updates to y_{t1 + t+1} for the next turn.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T based on y_T.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1 + H-1, and after H actions, at turn t1 + H, position is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H} = 9, and no collision at any turn from t1 to t1 + H-1? Let's see.\n\nAt each turn T from t1 to t1 + H-1, the player is at y_T, and collision is checked for that freeway at that turn.\n\nAfter action at turn t1 + H-1, position is y_{t1 + H}, which should be 9, and since we don't care beyond that, no collision at turn t1 + H if we stop, but the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and avoid collisions during the process.\n\nThe collision is only considered when the player is on a freeway, so for y=0 or y=9, no cars, so no collision possible. Cars are only on y=1 to 8.\n\nSo at y=0 or y=9, safe.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,4), which is on freeway y=4.\n\nGoal is to be at (0,9), which is safe.\n\nNow, actions affect y-position.\n\nMinimal H to go from y=4 to y=9, ignoring cars, would be 5 steps up, so H=5, but with cars, we might need to wait or detour.\n\nBut we can only move up, down, or stay, so to increase y from 4 to 9, we need at least 5 up moves, but we might have down or stay to avoid cars, which could increase H.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t1 to t1 + H-1 actions, position at turn t1 + H is the result.\n\nLet me set t=0 as turn 64.\n\nSo at time t=0: y=4\n\nAfter action a_0, at time t=1, y= y_0 + Δy_0, and so on.\n\nAt time t, for t=0,1,2,..., we have position y_t.\n\nCollision at time t if y_t is between 1 and 8, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at time t.\n\nWe need to find min H such that y_H = 9, and for all t from 0 to H-1, no collision at time t. Since at t=H, if y_H=9, no car, so safe.\n\ny_t for t=0 to H-1 must be safe.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-18, -29, right, 3)\n\nSince right-moving, at time t (relative to t1=0), Span(t) = [τ + s t, h + s t] with τ=-29, h=-18, s=3\n\nSo Span(t) = [-29 + 3t, -18 + 3t]\n\n0 in span if -29 + 3t <= 0 <= -18 + 3t\n\nWhich is 3t <= 29 and 3t >= 18, so t >= 6 and t <= 9.666, so t=6,7,8,9 since t integer.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-18, -29, right, 3), identical, so same times unsafe: t=6,7,8,9\n\nFreeway 3: also (-18, -29, right, 3), same, unsafe t=6,7,8,9\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars: (-8, -19, right, 4), (28, 17, right, 4), (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: (-8, -19, right, 4)\n\nRight-moving, so Span(t) = [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-19 + 4t, -8 + 4t]\n\n0 in span if -19 + 4t <= 0 <= -8 + 4t\n\nSo 4t <= 19 and 4t >= 8, t >= 2 and t <= 4.75, so t=2,3,4\n\nSecond car: (28, 17, right, 4)\n\nHead=28, tail=17? But direction right, so Span(t) = [τ + s t, h + s t] = [17 + 4t, 28 + 4t]\n\n0 in span: 17+4t <= 0 <= 28+4t? But 17+4t >=17>0 for t>=0, so 0 <= 17+4t always false? min is 17+4t >0, so never covers 0. Similarly, max 28+4t>0, so 0 not in [17+4t, 28+4t] since both positive.\n\nSo this car never covers x=0.\n\nThird car: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nSpan(t) = [-59 + 4t, -48 + 4t]\n\n0 in span: -59+4t <=0 <= -48+4t\n\nSo 4t <=59 and 4t >=48, t >=12 and t <=14.75, so t=12,13,14\n\nSo for freeway 4, unsafe when any car covers 0: from first car t=2,3,4; third car t=12,13,14; second car never. So unsafe t=2,3,4,12,13,14\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nSpan(t) = [-59 + 12t, -48 + 12t]\n\n0 in span: -59+12t <=0 <= -48+12t\n\n12t <=59 and 12t >=48, t >=4 and t <=4.916, so t=4? 12t >=48 => t>=4, 12t <=59 => t<=4.916, so t=4 only? Let's compute.\n\n-59+12t <=0 => 12t <=59 => t<=59/12=4.916, so t<=4 since t integer? t<= floor(59/12)=4? 12*4=48<59, 12*5=60>59.\n\n-59+12t <=0 when t<=4.916, but since integer, for t<=4, -59+12t <= -59+48= -11<0? At t=4, -59+48= -11 <=0, yes.\n\n0 <= -48 +12t? -48+12t >=0 when 12t>=48, t>=4.\n\nSo at t=4, -59+48= -11 <=0 <= -48+48=0? 0<=0 is true, so yes.\n\nAt t=5, -59+60=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, and -48+60=12>=0, but 1<=0 false, so not covered.\n\nSimilarly, t=3: -59+36= -23 <=0 true, but 0 <= -48+36= -12? 0<= -12 false, so no.\n\nSo only t=4.\n\nSecond car: (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nHead=0, tail=-11, right, speed=12.\n\nSpan(t) = [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-11 + 12t, 0 + 12t] = [-11+12t, 12t]\n\n0 in span: min <=0 <= max.\n\nmin = -11+12t, max=12t.\n\n-11+12t <=0 <=12t\n\nNow, 0 <=12t always true for t>=0.\n\n-11+12t <=0 => 12t <=11 => t<=11/12<1, so t<=0.916, so for t=0, -11+0= -11<=0, and 0<=0, so at t=0, 0 is covered? min=-11, max=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included.\n\nAt t=0, Span(0) = [-11, 0], so x=0 is the head, covered.\n\nFor t>0, min=-11+12t, at t=1, min=1, max=12, [1,12], min>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nAt t=0, covered.\n\nBut t=0 is the current time.\n\nFor freeway 5, at time t=0, there is a car that covers x=0: the second car (0, -11, right, 12), at t=0, span [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nAlso, first car at t=4 covers 0.\n\nBut at t=0, freeway 5 has a car covering 0.\n\nNow, player is at y=4 at t=0, not y=5, so for collision at t=0, it depends on y_0=4, not 5.\n\nFreeway 5 is y=5.\n\nAt time t, collision if on freeway y_t, and car on that row covers 0.\n\nAt t=0, player on y=4, freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 5 is different.\n\nFor freeway 5, unsafe times:\n\nFirst car: only t=4\n\nSecond car: at t=0, covered, and for t>0 not covered.\n\nSo unsafe when: t=0 (from second car) and t=4 (from first car)\n\nt=0: covered by second car.\n\nt=4: covered by first car.\n\nNow freeway 6: same cars as freeway 5? (-48, -59, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nIdentical to freeway 5, so unsafe t=0 and t=4\n\nBut freeway 6 is y=6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: same, unsafe t=0 and t=4\n\nFreeway 8: same, unsafe t=0 and t=4\n\nNow, also freeway 1,2,3 unsafe at t=6,7,8,9\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe at t=2,3,4,12,13,14\n\nAnd freeways 5,6,7,8 unsafe at t=0 and t=4\n\nt=0 is current time, but player is on y=4, not on these.\n\nNow, let's summarize for each freeway, the unsafe times when 0 is covered by some car.\n\ny=1: unsafe t=6,7,8,9\n\ny=2: same as y=1, t=6,7,8,9\n\ny=3: same, t=6,7,8,9\n\ny=4: unsafe t=2,3,4,12,13,14\n\ny=5: unsafe t=0,4  (t=0 from second car, t=4 from first car)\n\nBut t=0 is now, and player not on y=5.\n\ny=6: same as y=5, unsafe t=0,4\n\ny=7: same, unsafe t=0,4\n\ny=8: same, unsafe t=0,4\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at t=0, y=4.\n\nAt t=0, y=4 is freeway 4, which is unsafe at t=2,3,4,12,13,14. At t=0, is it unsafe?\n\nFor freeway 4, we have unsafe times t=2,3,4,12,13,14. t=0 not in the list, so at t=0, no car covers 0 on y=4.\n\nFirst car: t=2,3,4; third car t=12,13,14; second car never. So at t=0, all spans: for first car, [-19, -8], min=-19<0, max=-8<0, so 0 not covered. Second car [17,28] all positive, no. Third car [-59,-48] all negative, no. So y=4 safe at t=0.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, at t=0, y=5,6,7,8 are unsafe because of the second car with (0,-11,right,12) at t=0, span includes 0. But player not there.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=4 to y=9 in min turns.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe minimal path in terms of moves: to go from y=4 to y=9, we need to increase y by 5, so at least 5 up moves. But we can stay or go down to avoid cars, which takes extra turns.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=0 to t=H-1, with y_H =9.\n\ny_t for t=0 to H-1 must not be in collision.\n\nSince we start at y=4, and need to reach y=9, we must pass through y=5,6,7,8 at some points, but not necessarily consecutively; we can stay or move down.\n\nBut to minimize H, we probably want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid unsafe times on each row.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe times for each row:\n\ny=1: unsafe t=6,7,8,9\n\ny=2: same, t=6,7,8,9\n\ny=3: same, t=6,7,8,9\n\ny=4: unsafe t=2,3,4,12,13,14\n\ny=5: unsafe t=0,4  (t=0 is past, but t=4 is future)\n\nt=0 is current, but at t=0, player on y=4, so for y=5, unsafe at t=4 only? Earlier I said t=0 and t=4, but t=0 is now, and for future, t=4 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8: unsafe only at t=4? For y=5, unsafe times: t=0 from second car, but t=0 is fixed, and for t=4 from first car.\n\nSince we are planning from now, t=0 onwards, for collision at time t>=0.\n\nAt t=0, y=5 is unsafe, but we are at t=0, y=4, so when we consider being on y=5 at some future t, unsafe only at t=4? Let's clarify.\n\nThe unsafe times are for when the row has a car covering x=0.\n\nFor y=5, at time t, if t=0, covered by second car (span includes 0).\n\nAt t=4, covered by first car.\n\nFor other t, not covered.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8 same.\n\ny=4 unsafe at t=2,3,4,12,13,14\n\ny=1,2,3 unsafe at t=6,7,8,9\n\nNow, player starts at t=0, y=4, safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some H.\n\ny_t must be between 0 and 9, and safe for t=0 to H-1.\n\nTo go up, we need to move to higher y.\n\nThe critical points are the unsafe times on each row.\n\nSince y=5,6,7,8 are all unsafe only at t=4, except y=5 also at t=0 but t=0 not relevant.\n\nFor y=5, unsafe at t=4\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8 unsafe at t=4\n\ny=4 unsafe at t=2,3,4\n\nBut t=4 is unsafe for all y=4,5,6,7,8? y=4 unsafe at t=4, y=5 at t=4, etc.\n\nt=4 is bad for all rows from 4 to 8.\n\ny=4,5,6,7,8 all unsafe at t=4.\n\ny=4 unsafe t=2,3,4\n\ny=5 unsafe t=4\n\ny=6 unsafe t=4\n\netc.\n\nBut y=1,2,3 unsafe at t=6,7,8,9\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to be on y=8 at some point before, and move up.\n\nBut y=8 is unsafe at t=4.\n\nAlso, we start at y=4.\n\nSince t=4 is unsafe for many rows, we might want to avoid being on rows 4-8 at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, other unsafe times.\n\nMinimal H: if no cars, we could go up in 5 moves: U,U,U,U,U, so at t=0 y=4, a0=U, t=1 y=5, a1=U, t=2 y=6, ..., t=4 y=8, a4=U, t=5 y=9.\n\nBut check collisions.\n\nAt t=0: y=4, safe as we saw.\n\nt=1: if we go to y=5, what is y at t=1?\n\nAt time t=1, position y_1.\n\nIf at t=0, we do U, then y_1 =5.\n\nThen at t=1, we are on y=5.\n\ny=5 unsafe at t=4? t=1 is not t=4, so at t=1, is y=5 safe?\n\nFor y=5, unsafe only at t=0 and t=4. t=0 past, so at t=1, not unsafe, since no car covers 0 at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, at t=1, for y=5, the cars: first car span at t: [-59+12t, -48+12t], at t=1, [-47,-36]? -59+12= -47, -48+12= -36, both negative, 0 not covered.\n\nSecond car: [-11+12t, 12t], at t=1, [1,12], min=1>0, not cover 0.\n\nSo y=5 safe at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=6 at t=2, etc.\n\nBut let's see the path: t=0 y=4, a=U\n\nt=1 y=5\n\nt=2 y=6, but at t=2, y=6: is it safe?\n\ny=6 unsafe only at t=4? At t=2, should be safe.\n\nCars on y=6: same as y=5, at t=2, first car span [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24] <0, not cover 0.\n\nSecond car [-11+24, 24] = [13,24] >0, not cover 0. So safe.\n\nt=3 y=7, similarly safe.\n\nt=4 y=8, at t=4, y=8: unsafe! Because at t=4, for y=8, cars cover 0.\n\nFirst car: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], so min=-11<=0, max=0, so 0 covered.\n\nSecond car: at t=4, [-11+48, 48] = [37,48], not cover 0.\n\nBut first car covers 0, so at t=4, on y=8, collision.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=4, y=8, which is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if we reach y=8 at t=4, collision.\n\nAlso, at t=2, if we were on y=4, it would be unsafe, but in this path, at t=2 we are on y=6.\n\nIn the direct up path: t=0 y=4 safe, t=1 y=5 safe, t=2 y=6 safe, t=3 y=7 safe, t=4 y=8 unsafe.\n\nSo collision at t=4.\n\nThus, we need to avoid being on rows 4-8 at t=4.\n\nSpecifically, since y=8 at t=4 is unsafe, and similarly other rows.\n\nNow, we could stay or move down at some point to avoid t=4.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nSince y=1,2,3 are safe except at t=6,7,8,9, which are later.\n\nt=4 is early.\n\nWe could go down to lower rows to avoid the t=4 problem, but lower rows have unsafe times later, but we might not need to go there.\n\nMinimal H might be achieved by waiting or moving down temporarily.\n\nSince we start at y=4, and t=4 is unsafe for y=4,5,6,7,8, we should not be on these rows at t=4.\n\nSo at t=4, we need to be on y=0,1,2,3 or 9.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, probably not yet.\n\ny=0 or 1,2,3.\n\nBut y=1,2,3 are unsafe at t=6-9, but t=4 is before, so at t=4 they might be safe.\n\ny=1,2,3 unsafe only at t=6,7,8,9, so at t=4, they are safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 always safe.\n\nSo at t=4, we can be on y=0,1,2,3 or 9.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we might go down to y=3 or something at t=4, then go up later.\n\nBut going down takes extra moves.\n\nSince from y=4, to reach y=9, min 5 up moves, but with detour.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can reach y=9 before t=4 or after.\n\nBefore t=4: from t=0 to t=3, we have 4 actions: from t=0 to t=4 positions: y0=4, after a0,a1,a2,a3, position at t=4.\n\nTo be at y=9 at t=4, we need to go up 5 times in 4 moves? From t=0 to t=4, we have 4 actions, so y4 = y0 + sum Δy for t=0,1,2,3.\n\nMax increase: 4 up moves, y4 = 4+4=8, since each U increases by 1, so in 4 moves, max y=8, cannot reach y=9 before t=5.\n\nSimilarly, min H is at least 5, since 5 up moves needed.\n\nAt t=5, y=9 possible.\n\nBut in the direct path, at t=4 we are stuck on y=8 which is unsafe.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on unsafe positions.\n\nOne way: at t=4, be on a safe row, like y=3 or lower.\n\nThen go up to y=9.\n\nBut y=3 is safe at t=4, since unsafe only at t=6-9.\n\nSimilarly, y=2,1,0 safe at t=4.\n\nNow, from start, we can go down to lower rows before t=4.\n\nFor example, from y=4 at t=0, we can do D to go to y=3 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, y=3, which is safe.\n\nThen we can stay or move.\n\nBut we need to be safe at t=4.\n\nOptions for t=4 position.\n\nWe want y4 not in {4,5,6,7,8}, so y4 <=3 or y4=9, but y4=9 impossible as above.\n\nSo y4 <=3.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nNow, from y=4 to y=3, that takes one down move, then from y=3 to y=9, need 6 up moves, so total turns: to reach y=9, after H actions, y_H=9.\n\nStart at t=0 y=4.\n\nAfter k actions, position at t=k.\n\ny_H=9.\n\nIf we go down first, say at t=0, action D, then t=1 y=3.\n\nThen from t=1 to say t=m, we need to get to y=9.\n\ny_m =9 for some m.\n\nFrom y=3 to y=9, min 6 up moves, but we might have stays or downs.\n\nBut to minimize H, we want min moves.\n\nBut we have to avoid unsafe times.\n\nFirst, at t=4, we need y4 <=3.\n\nSo from t=0 to t=4, we have actions a0 to a3, position at t=4.\n\ny0=4.\n\ny4 = 4 + Δy0 + Δy1 + Δy2 + Δy3\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so y4 between 1 and 7? Min y4=4-4=0, max 4+4=8.\n\nBut we need y4 <=3.\n\nSo the sum of Δy from t=0 to3 must be <= -1, since 4 + sum <=3, so sum <= -1.\n\nThat is, net down or stay with down moves.\n\nThen after t=4, from y4 <=3, go to y=9, which takes at least 6 up moves.\n\nSo total actions: from t=0 to t=3, 4 actions, then from t=4 onwards, at least 6 actions to go from y4 to 9.\n\ny at t=4 is say y4, then after actions a4 to a_{H-1}, y_H = y4 + sum_{i=4}^{H-1} Δy_i\n\nSet to 9.\n\nSince y4 <=3, let d = 9 - y4 >=6, so at least 6 up moves needed, so number of actions from a4 to a_{H-1} is at least 6, so H-1 -4 +1 = H-4 actions? From t=4 to t=H-1, actions a4 to a_{H-1}, number is (H-1)-4 +1 = H-4 actions.\n\nThen y_H = y4 + sum of Δy for those actions.\n\nTo reach 9, need sum Δy = 9 - y4 >=6, since y4<=3.\n\nSo min number of actions is 6 if all U, but we might need extra for avoidance.\n\nBut y4 <=3, and we need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, during this, we have to avoid unsafe times for the rows we are on.\n\nFor example, if we go to y=3 at t=4, then from t=4, y=3, we can go up.\n\nBut y=3 is unsafe at t=6,7,8,9.\n\nSimilarly, y=1,2 unsafe same times.\n\nNow, t=4 is safe for y=1,2,3.\n\nWe need to go up through y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=4 unsafe at t=2,3,4,12,13,14 but t=4 past, so for t>4, unsafe at t=12,13,14 which are later.\n\nt=12 is far.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7,8 unsafe only at t=4, which is past, so for t>4, they are always safe? Is that true?\n\nFor y=5, unsafe only at t=0 and t=4.\n\nt=0 and t=4 are the only times, so for t>4, no car covers x=0 on y=5, similarly for y=6,7,8.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nFor example, y=5 cars: first car at t=4 covers 0, but for t>4, span moves away.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12), span at t: [-59+12t, -48+12t]\n\nAt t=5, [-59+60=1, -48+60=12], [1,12] not cover 0.\n\nAt t=6, [13,24], etc.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), at t=0 covered, t=1 [1,12], not cover, and for t>0 never covers.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nSo for y=5,6,7,8, after t=4, no car covers x=0, so they are always safe for t>4.\n\ny=4: unsafe at t=12,13,14, which are later, but for t<12, it should be safe except for the earlier times which are past.\n\ny=4 unsafe at t=2,3,4,12,13,14.\n\nFor t between 5 and 11, it should be safe, since no car covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, for y=1,2,3 unsafe at t=6,7,8,9, so for t<6 or t>9, safe.\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nWe need to have y4 <=3 at t=4.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nThe up part can be done quickly since after t=4, y=5,6,7,8 are safe except for y=4 which has unsafe at t=12-14, but that's later, we might not be there.\n\nFirst, let's set y4 <=3.\n\nFor example, suppose we go to y=3 at t=4.\n\nHow to get there from y=4 at t=0.\n\nWe need sum Δy from t=0 to3 to be -1, since y4=3=4 + sum Δy, so sum Δy = -1.\n\nSo we need one down move and three stays, or other combinations, but since we want to minimize time, probably one down and the rest can be stay or up, but to have sum Δy = -1, options: one D and three S, or one D, one U, and two S but net -1? D is -1, U is +1, S=0.\n\nSo to have sum = -1: possibilities:\n\n- One D and three S: net -1\n\n- One D, one U, two S: net 0? D and U cancel, S no change, net 0.\n\n- Two D and one U and one S: net -2 +1 = -1, etc.\n\nBut with four actions, to have net -1, we must have one more D than U, and S.\n\nEasier: number of U minus number of D equals net Δy.\n\nLet U, D, S be counts.\n\nU - D = net Δy\n\nAnd U + D + S = 4 actions? From t=0 to3, 4 actions.\n\ny4 = 4 + (U - D) *1 + S*0, since S doesn't change.\n\ny4 = 4 + (number of U) - (number of D)\n\nSet y4 <=3, so 4 + U - D <=3, so U - D <= -1.\n\nAlso, U + D + S =4.\n\nWe need to specify the sequence.\n\nBut we also need to avoid collision during t=0 to t=3.\n\nAt t=0, y=4 safe.\n\nNow, during the moves, we will be on various y positions at times t=1,2,3.\n\ny_t for t=1,2,3 must be safe.\n\ny=4 unsafe at t=2,3,4 but t=4 is the position time, for collision at time t, so at t=2 and t=3, y=4 is unsafe.\n\nt=4 is also unsafe but at t=4 we are not on y=4 if we are at y4<=3.\n\nFor t=1,2,3, we need y_t not unsafe.\n\nSpecifically, if we are on y=4 at t=2 or t=3, collision.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nNow, let's list safe times for each row.\n\ny=4: safe except t=2,3,4. So for t=1, if we are on y=4, it is safe? t=1: earlier we saw for freeway 4, at t=1, no car covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, t=0 safe, t=1 safe, unsafe only t=2,3,4.\n\nSo at t=1, y=4 safe.\n\ny=5: unsafe at t=4, but for t=1,2,3 safe? t=0 unsafe but past.\n\nAt t=1: as above, safe.\n\nt=2: similarly, cars on y=5: first car [-59+24? t=2, s=12, [-59+24, -48+24]= [-35,-24]<0, not cover; second car [-11+24,24]=[13,24]>0 not cover, so safe.\n\nSimilarly t=3: first car [-59+36,-48+36]=[-23,-12]<0, second car [-11+36,36]=[25,36]>0, safe.\n\nOnly unsafe at t=4.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8 same.\n\ny=3: unsafe at t=6,7,8,9, so for t=1,2,3,4 safe? t=4 is time.\n\nAt t=1,2,3,4 y=3 should be safe, since unsafe starts at t=6.\n\nSimilarly y=2,1 safe for t<6.\n\nNow, back to getting to y4=3.\n\nWe need U - D <= -1 for the actions from t=0 to3.\n\nAnd positions safe.\n\nOne simple way: at t=0, do S, so y1=4 (since S, no change)\n\nAction at t=0, a0, then y1 = y0 + Δy0.\n\nIf a0=S, y1=4.\n\nThen at t=1, y=4, which is safe since t=1 safe for y=4.\n\nThen at t=1, we can do D, so a1=D, then y2=4-1=3.\n\nThen at t=2, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=2, we can do S, a2=S, y3=3.\n\nThen at t=3, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=3, do S, a3=S, y4=3.\n\nSo at t=4, y=3, safe.\n\nSequence: a0=S, a1=D, a2=S, a3=S, y4=3.\n\nWe could have other sequences, but this works with net down one.\n\nNow, from here, at t=4, y=3, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 can be reached in min 6 moves: U,U,U,U,U,U.\n\nBut we have to go through y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nAfter t=4, for t>=5, y=4,5,6,7,8 are all safe except y=4 at t=12,13,14, but t=12 is later, we might reach before.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 is unsafe at t=6,7,8,9.\n\nNow, at t=4, y=3.\n\nIf we go up directly: a4=U, t=5 y=4\n\na5=U, t=6 y=5\n\na6=U, t=7 y=6\n\na7=U, t=8 y=7\n\na8=U, t=9 y=8\n\na9=U, t=10 y=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nt=4: y=3, safe\n\nt=5: y=4, now is y=4 safe at t=5? y=4 unsafe at t=12,13,14, not t=5, so yes safe.\n\nt=6: y=5, after t=4, y=5 always safe, so safe.\n\nBut at t=6, y=5, but also y=3 is unsafe at t=6, but we are on y=5, not y=3.\n\nCollision only if on the row at that time.\n\nAt t=6, we are on y=5, which is safe.\n\nt=7: y=6, safe\n\nt=8: y=7, safe\n\nt=9: y=8, safe\n\nt=10: y=9, safe, and we stop.\n\ny at t=10 is 9, so we reached at H=10? t=10 means after 10 actions? Let's see the turns.\n\nTime t=0 to t=10, positions y0 to y10.\n\nActions at turns t=0 to t=9, 10 actions, y10=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn t1=64 to t1 + H -1, with y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nIn relative time, from t=0 to t=H, with actions at t=0 to t=H-1, y_H=9.\n\nIn this case, y10=9, so H=10, actions from t=0 to t=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=6, y=5, safe.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\ny=3 is unsafe at t=6, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut we used 10 turns: from t=0 to t=9 actions, y10=9.\n\nBut earlier, without cars, min is 5, but we took extra 5 turns: one down and four stays? In the first part, we had a0=S, a1=D, a2=S, a3=S, then a4=U to a9=U, so actions: S,D,S,S,U,U,U,U,U,U. That's 10 actions.\n\nBut we can optimize.\n\nFor example, in the first part, to get to y4=3, we used one down and stays, but we could have gone down faster or something.\n\nSince at t=4 we need to be low, but we could be at y=0 or something, but that might take more down moves.\n\ny=3 is fine.\n\nAnother way: at t=0, instead of staying, go down immediately.\n\na0=D, then y1=3.\n\nThen at t=1, y=3, safe.\n\nThen we need to be at y<=3 at t=4.\n\nAt t=1, y=3, we can stay or move.\n\nBut to minimize, we can stay until t=4.\n\nFor example: a0=D, y1=3\n\na1=S, y2=3\n\na2=S, y3=3\n\na3=S, y4=3\n\nSame as before, but we went down at t=0 instead of t=1.\n\nIn previous, we had a0=S, a1=D, etc.\n\nNow a0=D, a1=S, a2=S, a3=S, y4=3.\n\nThen same up sequence.\n\nBut still, from t=4 to t=10, 6 up moves? From y=3 to y=9, 6 steps: a4=U y5=4, a5=U y6=5, ..., a9=U y10=9.\n\nSame H=10.\n\nBut can we reach faster?\n\nMinimal H: since we need to avoid t=4 on middle rows, and go up after.\n\nBut after t=4, we can go up fast.\n\nThe delay is in the first part: we have to spend some turns to be low at t=4.\n\nWith 4 actions to t=4, we can be at y=3 with net -1.\n\nBut y=3 is only one down, we could be at y=0 with more down, but that would require more down moves, which might increase H.\n\nFor example, if we go to y=0 at t=4, we need sum Δy <= -4, so multiple down moves, then from there to y=9, need 9 up moves, so H larger.\n\nSo better to be at higher y when possible.\n\nThus y=3 at t=4 is fine.\n\nBut can we reach y=9 before t=10?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=8 or something after t=4, but at t=4 we are at y=3.\n\nAfter t=4, we need 6 moves to go to y=9.\n\nIs there a way to be at higher y at t=4? But y4 must be <=3, so no.\n\nUnless we can reach y=9 at t=5 or earlier, but impossible as min 5 moves from y=4.\n\nFrom y=4, min 5 moves to y=9: at t=5 y=9 possible if all U, but at t=4 y=8 unsafe.\n\nSo we must not be at y=8 at t=4.\n\nThus, cannot reach before t=5.\n\nAt t=5, y=9 possible only if we were at y=8 at t=4, but unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot reach at t=5.\n\nSimilarly, at t=6: if we can be at y=9 at t=6.\n\ny6=9.\n\nFrom y0=4, in 6 actions, we can reach y=9 with net +5, so U - D =5, with 6 actions.\n\nBut we need to avoid unsafe positions.\n\nSpecifically, at t=4, we need to be safe, not on rows 4-8.\n\nSo y4 <=3 or y4=9, but y4=9 impossible.\n\ny4 <=3.\n\nThen from y4 <=3 to y6=9, in two actions? Impossible, since max increase 2, y6 <= y4 +2 <=5 <9.\n\ny6 = y4 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\nMax y6 = y4 +2 <=5 <9.\n\nSo cannot reach y=9 at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=7: y7=9.\n\ny7 = y4 + Δy4 + Δy5 + Δy6\n\ny4 <=3, so max y7 <=3+3=6<9, not enough.\n\nt=8: y8=9, y4<=3, max y8<=3+4=7<9? Actions from t=4 to t=7, 4 actions, y8 = y4 + sum_{i=4}^7 Δy_i <=3+4=7<9.\n\ny8 = position at t=8, after actions up to a7.\n\nActions a4 to a7, four actions, y8 = y4 + Δy4 + Δy5 + Δy6 + Δy7\n\nMax increase 4, so y8 <= y4 +4 <=3+4=7<9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 before t=9? t=9: y9=9.\n\ny9 = y4 + sum_{i=4}^8 Δy_i\n\nFive actions from t=4 to t=8, y9 = y4 + Δy4 + ... + Δy8\n\nMax y9 <= y4 +5 <=3+5=8<9, still less? y4 <=3, max increase 5 in five actions, y9 <= 3+5=8<9.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need exactly 9 - y4 up moves.\n\nSince y4 <=3, 9 - y4 >=6, so at least 6 actions needed after t=4.\n\nThus, the earliest we can reach y=9 is at t=4 + 6 =10, if y4=3.\n\nIf y4=2, then need 7 up moves, later.\n\nSo minimal H is 10, with y4=3.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have H=10.\n\nBut in the action sequence, we can reduce some stays.\n\nFor example, in the first part, to get to y4=3, we can have fewer actions but we have to use 4 actions to reach t=4.\n\nWe must have four actions from t=0 to t=3 to set y4.\n\nBut we can have actions that don't change position much, but we need to be safe at each step.\n\nIn the sequence: a0=S, a1=D, a2=S, a3=S, y4=3\n\nAt t=0: y=4 safe\n\na0=S, y1=4\n\nt=1: y=4 safe (t=1 safe)\n\na1=D, y2=3\n\nt=2: y=3 safe (t=2<6)\n\na2=S, y3=3\n\nt=3: y=3 safe\n\na3=S, y4=3\n\nt=4: y=3 safe\n\nThen a4=U, y5=4\n\nt=5: y=4 safe (t=5 not unsafe)\n\na5=U, y6=5\n\nt=6: y=5 safe (after t=4 safe)\n\na6=U, y7=6\n\nt=7: y=6 safe\n\na7=U, y8=7\n\nt=8: y=7 safe\n\na8=U, y9=8\n\nt=9: y=8 safe\n\na9=U, y10=9\n\nt=10: y=9, goal.\n\nBut at t=9, y=8, which is safe since after t=4.\n\nNow, but we have some S actions, which might not be necessary.\n\nFor example, in the first part, instead of staying, we could go down to y=3 faster.\n\na0=D, y1=3\n\nThen at t=1, y=3.\n\nWe need y4=3, so we can stay: a1=S, y2=3; a2=S, y3=3; a3=S, y4=3.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut at t=1, we could go down to y=2, but then y4 might be lower, requiring more up moves later.\n\nFor example, if a0=D, y1=3\n\na1=D, y2=2\n\na2=S, y3=2\n\na3=S, y4=2\n\nThen y4=2, then to y=9, need 7 up moves, so y11=9, H=11, worse.\n\nSo better to stay at y=3.\n\nIn the up part, we go directly, no problem.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we have two S in the first part and no S in up, but total H=10.\n\nCan we start going up earlier?\n\nFor example, at t=3, y=3, but we need to set y4=3, so at t=3 action must be S or something to keep y4=3.\n\nBut y4 is at t=4.\n\nSince at t=3, if we do U, then y4=4, but y4=4 is unsafe at t=4, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nDo S at t=3 to y4=3.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=4 at some times but avoid unsafe times.\n\nFor example, y=4 unsafe at t=2,3,4.\n\nSo if we can be off y=4 at t=2,3,4.\n\nBut at t=4, we need to be off anyway.\n\nSuppose we go up at the beginning.\n\nFor example, at t=0, a0=U, y1=5\n\nt=1: y=5, safe as before.\n\nThen at t=1, we need to avoid y=4 at t=2,3,4, but we are at y=5.\n\nNow, if we stay, a1=S, y2=5\n\nt=2: y=5 safe\n\nThen a2=S, y3=5\n\nt=3: y=5 safe\n\nThen at t=3, if we do S, y4=5, but at t=4, y=5 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we do D at t=3, a3=D, y4=4, but y=4 unsafe at t=4, collision.\n\nIf we do U at t=3, y4=6, but y=6 unsafe at t=4, since y=6 unsafe t=4.\n\nAll rows 4-8 unsafe at t=4.\n\nSo at t=4, if we are on y=5,6,7, or8, collision.\n\nOnly safe if y=0,1,2,3 or9.\n\nBut from y=5 at t=3, if we do D, y4=4, unsafe; S, y4=5, unsafe; U, y4=6, unsafe.\n\nNo way to be safe at t=4 from y=5 at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, if we were at y=6 at t=3, same issue.\n\nSo we must be at low row at t=3 to be able to move to safe at t=4.\n\nFor example, at t=3, if we are at y=3, we can do S to y4=3 safe.\n\nOr if at y=2, do S to y=2, or U to y=3, both safe.\n\nBut in the up path, we are high.\n\nThus, the only way is to go down early to be low at t=4.\n\nTherefore, H=10 seems necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach at t=9 or earlier.\n\nt=9: y9=9.\n\ny9 = y0 + sum_{t=0}^8 Δy_t\n\ny0=4, need y9=9, so sum Δy =5 over 9 actions? Actions from t=0 to t=8, 9 actions.\n\ny9 = 4 + sum_{k=0}^8 Δy_k\n\nSet to 9, so sum_{k=0}^8 Δy_k =5.\n\nAlso, at t=4, y4 must be <=3.\n\ny4 = 4 + sum_{k=0}^3 Δy_k <=3, so sum_{k=0}^3 Δy_k <= -1.\n\nThen from y4 to y9, 5 actions: a4 to a8, y9 = y4 + sum_{i=4}^8 Δy_i\n\ny9=9, so y4 + sum_{i=4}^8 Δy_i =9.\n\nSince y4 <=3, let s = sum_{i=4}^8 Δy_i, so y4 + s =9, s=9-y4 >=6.\n\nBut with 5 actions, max s=5, so 9-y4 <=5, so y4 >=4.\n\nBut we have y4 <=3 and y4 >=4, contradiction.\n\nThus impossible to reach at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, for t=10: y10=9.\n\ny10 = 4 + sum_{k=0}^9 Δy_k =9, so sum_{k=0}^9 Δy_k =5.\n\n10 actions, net +5.\n\nNow, y4 <=3.\n\ny4 = 4 + sum_{k=0}^3 Δy_k <=3, so sum_{k=0}^3 Δy_k <= -1.\n\nLet s1 = sum_{k=0}^3 Δy_k <= -1\n\nThen y4 =4 + s1\n\nThen y10 = y4 + sum_{k=4}^9 Δy_k = (4 + s1) + s2\n\nWhere s2 = sum_{k=4}^9 Δy_k\n\ny10=9, so (4 + s1) + s2 =9, so s1 + s2 =5.\n\ns1 <= -1, so s2 =5 - s1 >=5 - (- something), since s1 <= -1, -s1 >=1, so s2 >=6.\n\ns2 has 6 actions (t=4 to9), so s2 >=6 possible only if all U, s2=6.\n\nThen s1 +6=5, so s1= -1.\n\nThen y4=4 + (-1)=3.\n\nThen s2=6, so all U from t=4 to9.\n\nThus, exactly: in first 4 actions, net -1, and last 6 actions all U.\n\nAnd positions must be safe.\n\nIn the sequence, we can have, for example:\n\na0: S or D, etc.\n\nTo have net -1 in first 4 actions.\n\nOptions: one D and three S; or one D, one U, two S but net 0 not -1; or two D, one U, one S: net -2+1= -1; or three D, one U: net -3+1= -2, etc.\n\nBut with the safe constraints.\n\nFor example, if we do one D and three S.\n\nWe need to be safe at each t.\n\nAt t=0: y=4 safe.\n\nIf a0=S, y1=4\n\nt=1: y=4 safe (t=1 safe)\n\nThen a1=D, y2=3\n\nt=2: y=3 safe\n\na2=S, y3=3\n\nt=3: y=3 safe\n\na3=S, y4=3\n\nThen a4=U, y5=4\n\nt=5: y=4 safe\n\na5=U, y6=5\n\nt=6: y=5 safe\n\na6=U, y7=6\n\nt=7: y=6 safe\n\na7=U, y8=7\n\nt=8: y=7 safe\n\na8=U, y9=8\n\nt=9: y=8 safe\n\na9=U, y10=9\n\nIn the actions, a3=S at t=3, then a4=U at t=4, etc.\n\nBut at t=9, y=8, then a9=U to y10=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have a2=S and a3=S, both stays at y=3.\n\nWe could avoid one stay.\n\nFor example, at t=2, y=3, instead of S, we could do something else, but we need y4=3, so we must do S at t=3 if we are at y=3.\n\nIf at t=2 y=3, we do U, then y3=4, but at t=3, y=4 unsafe! Because t=3 unsafe for y=4.\n\nNot good.\n\nDo D, y3=2, then y4 could be 2 or 3, but then y4=2<3, need more up moves.\n\nFor example: a0=D, y1=3\n\na1=S, y2=3\n\na2=U, but at t=2, if a2=U, y3=4, but t=3 y=4 unsafe, collision.\n\na2=D, y3=2\n\na3=S, y4=2\n\nThen y4=2, then to y=9, need 7 up moves, so s2=7, but we have only 6 actions from t=4 to9? t=4 to9 is 6 actions: a4 to a9.\n\ny10 = y4 + sum_{i=4}^9 Δy_i\n\ny4=2, y10=9, need sum=7, but 6 actions max sum=6, so y10<=8, cannot reach 9.\n\ny10= y4 + Δy4 + ... + Δy9, 6 terms, max +6, so y10 <=2+6=8<9.\n\nCannot reach.\n\nThus, must have y4=3 exactly, and all up after.\n\nIn the first part, net -1 with y4=3.\n\nIn the sequence, we have to have some stays or specific actions.\n\nAnother sequence: a0=D, y1=3\n\na1=S, y2=3\n\na2=S, y3=3\n\na3=S, y4=3\n\nThen a4=U, y5=4\n\n...\n\nSame as before.\n\na0=S, y1=4\n\na1=S, y2=4 but at t=2, y=4 unsafe! Cannot.\n\nIn my first sequence, I had a0=S, a1=D to y2=3, avoiding y=4 at t=2.\n\nIf a0=S, y1=4\n\nThen at t=1, if a1=S, y2=4, but t=2 y=4 unsafe, collision.\n\nSo cannot stay on y=4 at t=2.\n\nThus, in the sequence, we must leave y=4 before t=2.\n\nFor example, at t=0, we can do U to y1=5, but then we are on y=5 at t=1, which is safe, but then at t=4 we have problem as before.\n\nOr do D to y1=3.\n\nThen at t=1, y=3 safe.\n\nThen we can stay: a1=S, y2=3; a2=S, y3=3; a3=S, y4=3.\n\nAll safe.\n\nThen up as before.\n\na0=D, a1=S, a2=S, a3=S, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U\n\nBut a3=S at t=3, then a4=U at t=4.\n\nNow, actions: 10 actions.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list the actions for turns starting from t1=64.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have a3=S which is stay, but we can perhaps do without it, but we need to fill the actions.\n\nSince we need to be at y=3 at t=4, and we are at y=3 at t=1, we could do something at t=1,2,3 but we have to keep y=3 at t=4.\n\nFor example, at t=1, y=3, we can do S, or D to y=2, or U to y=4.\n\nIf U to y=4 at t=2, but t=2 y=4 unsafe, bad.\n\nIf D to y=2, then we need to come back, but more moves.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo the sequence with stays is fine.\n\nNow, but in the up part, we have a4 to a9 all U, but at t=6,7,8,9, we are on y=5,6,7,8 respectively, all safe.\n\nt=6 y=5, safe.\n\nBut y=3 is unsafe at t=6, but not relevant.\n\nNow, but we have an S at t=3, which is a turn, but necessary to wait.\n\nPerhaps we can start going up earlier, but no, because at t=4 we must be low.\n\nAnother idea: since after t=4, all rows safe except y=4 at t=12-14, but t=12 is late, we reach before.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=4 at t=5, which is before t=12, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, minimal H is 10.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach in H=9 by being at y=4 at t=4 but avoiding collision? But at t=4, y=4 unsafe, impossible.\n\nOr if we can be on y=9 at t=5, impossible.\n\nSo H=10 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we can write.\n\nBut in the first part, we can have different actions.\n\nFor example, to save one action, but we can't.\n\nSince net we need 5 up moves, but with the constraint.\n\nTotal actions: 10 actions, with 5 U and 5 other, but net +5, so number of U minus number of D =5.\n\nLet U, D, S.\n\nU - D =5\n\nU + D + S =10\n\nThen from U - D =5, U + D + S=10, add: 2U + S=15, subtract: 2D + S=5.\n\nSince S >=0, 2U <=15, U<=7.5, U<=7; 2D + S=5, D<=2.5, D<=2.\n\nBut in our case, with y4=3, we have in first 4 actions: for example, one D and three S, so D=1, S=3, U=0 for first 4.\n\nThen last 6: U=6, D=0, S=0.\n\nTotal U=6, D=1, S=3.\n\nU - D=6-1=5, yes.\n\nWe could have in first 4: two D, one U, one S: net U - D=1-2= -1, D=2, U=1, S=1.\n\nThen y4=4 + (1-2) =3, same.\n\nBut let's see if possible.\n\na0: say D, y1=3\n\na1: U, y2=4, but at t=2, y=4 unsafe! Collision at t=2.\n\nNot possible.\n\na0: U, y1=5\n\nBut then we are high, hard to get low.\n\na0: S, y1=4\n\na1: D, y2=3\n\nThen at t=2, y=3 safe.\n\nNow, a2: if we do U, y3=4, but at t=3, y=4 unsafe, collision.\n\nDo S, y3=3\n\na3: S, y4=3\n\nThen same as before.\n\nDo D at a2, y3=2, then y4=2 or 3, but if a3=U, y4=3, same.\n\nBut then y4=3, same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nThus, the sequence with a0=D, a1=S, a2=S, a3=S or a0=S, a1=D, a2=S, a3=S etc. are similar.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to list actions starting from turn t1=64.\n\nSo actions for turn 64, 65, ..., up to turn 64 + H -1.\n\nH=10, so turns 64 to 73.\n\nActions: let's write one sequence.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 64: D  (to go down to y=3)\n\nBut at turn 64, action a_{t1} = a_{64}\n\nAfter action, position for next turn.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 64, we do action, then at turn 65, new position.\n\nIn relative time, t=0: turn 64, action a0, then at t=1 turn 65, y1.\n\nIn the sequence I have a0=D, so at turn 64: D\n\nThen turn 65: S (a1=S)\n\nTurn 66: S (a2=S)\n\nTurn 67: S (a3=S)\n\nThen turn 68: U (a4=U)\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nThen at turn 74, position y=9.\n\nt=10 relative, turn 64 +10 =74.\n\nActions from turn 64 to 73, 10 actions.\n\ny at turn 74 is 9.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 67: S, which is fine.\n\nTo make it faster, but we can't.\n\nAnother sequence: a0=S, a1=D, a2=S, a3=S, then same up.\n\nTurn 64: S\n\nTurn 65: D\n\nTurn 66: S\n\nTurn 67: S\n\nTurn 68: U\n\n...\n\nSame.\n\nBut in this, at turn 64: S, stay at y=4.\n\nNow, for the car state, I think we covered.\n\nBut in freeway 4, there is a car at t=12,13,14, but we are on y=4 at t=5, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, no other issues.\n\nSo minimal H=10.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbers.\n\nCurrent turn: t_0=64, but in the problem, it says \"current turn is \\{t_1\\}\", and \"Turn t_1: a_{t1}\", etc.\n\nIn the state, \"Current Turn: t_0 = 64\", but in the task, it says \"current turn is \\{t_1\\}\", probably t_1 is 64.\n\nI think t_1=64.\n\nSo actions from turn 64 to turn 73.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut the player needs to reach (0,9), which is done.\n\nNow, about the cars on other rows, but since we are not on them at unsafe times, should be fine.\n\nFor example, at t=6,7,8,9, we are on y=5,6,7,8, which are safe after t=4.\n\nWhile y=1,2,3 are unsafe, but not occupied.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nThus, the sequence.\n\nTo write:\n\nOne possible sequence:\n\nTurn 64: S  (stay at y=4)\n\nTurn 65: D  (down to y=3)\n\nTurn 66: S  (stay at y=3)\n\nTurn 67: S  (stay at y=3)\n\nTurn 68: U  (up to y=4)\n\nTurn 69: U  (to y=5)\n\nTurn 70: U  (to y=6)\n\nTurn 71: U  (to y=7)\n\nTurn 72: U  (to y=8)\n\nTurn 73: U  (to y=9)\n\nThen at turn 74, position (0,9), reached.\n\nWith H=10 turns of actions.\n\nSince the action at turn 73 is U, to reach y=9 at turn 74.\n\nIn the sequence, we have three S, which might be reducible, but necessary.\n\nIf we do a0=D at turn 64, then we can have:\n\nTurn 64: D  (to y=3)\n\nTurn 65: S  (stay y=3)\n\nTurn 66: S  (stay y=3)\n\nTurn 67: S  (stay y=3)  // but at turn 67, t=3 relative, y=3, safe\n\nThen turn 68: U (to y=4)\n\netc., same.\n\nIn this, at turn 66 and 67, both S, but we could do something else, but not necessary.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 64\\) is 10, with the sequence of actions starting from turn 64 to turn 73.\n\n### Key Points from Game Dynamics and Car States:\n- The player starts at \\((0, 4)\\) on turn 64.\n- Cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) move according to their direction and speed, and collisions occur only if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) at turn \\(T\\) where \\(0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway at \\(T\\).\n- Freeway \\(y = 4\\) is unsafe at turns \\(t = 66, 67, 68\\) (relative to \\(t_1 = 64\\), so absolute turns 66, 67, 68) and later at turns 76-78 (but these are not relevant for the minimal path).\n- Freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are unsafe only at turn \\(t = 68\\) (absolute turn 68).\n- Freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3\\) are unsafe at turns \\(t = 70, 71, 72, 73\\) (absolute turns 70-73).\n- \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) are always safe.\n\n### Strategy to Minimize Turns:\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 4\\), at least 5 \"U\" actions are required, but detours are needed to avoid unsafe times.\n- Turn \\(t = 68\\) (absolute) is critical because freeways \\(y = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are all unsafe. Thus, the player must be on \\(y \\leq 3\\) or \\(y = 9\\) at turn 68.\n- Reaching \\(y = 9\\) before turn 69 is impossible due to the minimum 5 \"U\" actions required and the constraint at turn 68.\n- Being at \\(y = 9\\) at turn 69 or earlier is infeasible:\n  - At turn 69: Requires being at \\(y = 8\\) at turn 68, but \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe at turn 68.\n  - At turn 70: Requires a net increase of +6 from turn 64 to turn 70 with 6 actions, but with \\(y \\leq 3\\) at turn 68, the maximum reachable \\(y\\) at turn 70 is 6 (if all \"U\" from turn 68), which is less than 9.\n- The earliest possible turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) is turn 74 (after 10 actions), with the player at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 68 (absolute turn 68) and then performing 6 consecutive \"U\" actions.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turns 64 to 67**: Move to and stay at \\(y = 3\\) by turn 68 to avoid unsafe freeways. Specifically:\n  - At turn 64, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 4\\) (safe at turn 64).\n  - At turn 65, move down (D) to \\(y = 3\\) (safe at turn 65, as \\(y = 3\\) is unsafe only from turn 70).\n  - At turns 66 and 67, stay (S) to maintain \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as \\(y = 3\\) is unsafe only from turn 70).\n- **Turns 68 to 73**: Move up directly to \\(y = 9\\) with consecutive \"U\" actions, as freeways \\(y = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are safe after turn 68 (only unsafe at turn 68, which is avoided).\n\n### Sequence of Actions (turns 64 to 73):\n- Turn 64: S (stay at \\(y = 4\\), safe.\n- Turn 65: D (move to \\(y = 3\\)), safe.\n- Turn 66: S (stay at \\(y = 3\\)), safe.\n- Turn 67: S (stay at \\(y = 3\\)), safe.\n- Turn 68: U (move to \\(y = 4\\)), safe (turn 68 is after unsafe time for \\(y = 4\\) at turn 68? Correction: at turn 68, \\(y = 4\\) is unsafe, but the action is at turn 68, and position after action is for turn 69. At turn 68, the player is at \\(y = 3\\) before action, safe. After U action, position at turn 69 is \\(y = 4\\), which is safe as turn 69 > 68 and \\(y = 4\\) unsafe only at turns 66,67,68,76-78).\n- Turn 69: U (move to \\(y = 5\\)), safe (freeways \\(y = 5,6,7,8\\) safe after turn 68).\n- Turn 70: U (move to \\(y = 6\\)), safe.\n- Turn 71: U (move to \\(y = 7\\)), safe.\n- Turn 72: U (move to \\(y = 8\\)), safe.\n- Turn 73: U (move to \\(y = 9\\)), reaching the goal at turn 74.\n\n### Verification:\n- **Collision avoidance**:\n  - Turn 64: \\(y = 4\\), safe (no car covers 0 at turn 64).\n  - Turn 65: \\(y = 3\\), safe (unsafe only at turns 70-73).\n  - Turn 66: \\(y = 3\\), safe.\n  - Turn 67: \\(y = 3\\), safe.\n  - Turn 68: Position before action is \\(y = 3\\) (safe); after action, position at turn 69 is \\(y = 4\\).\n  - Turn 69: \\(y = 4\\), safe (turn 69 not unsafe for \\(y = 4\\)).\n  - Turns 70-73: \\(y = 5,6,7,8\\), all safe (no cars cover 0 after turn 68).\n- **Position at turn 74**: \\(y = 9\\), goal reached.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in 10 turns, and it is minimal since \\(H = 9\\) or less is impossible due to the constraints at turn 68 and the minimum required upward moves.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 64: S \\\\\nTurn 65: D \\\\\nTurn 66: S \\\\\nTurn 67: S \\\\\nTurn 68: U \\\\\nTurn 69: U \\\\\nTurn 70: U \\\\\nTurn 71: U \\\\\nTurn 72: U \\\\\nTurn 73: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For each car, I'm given its position at turn t1=68, and I need to find where it will be at future turns to avoid collisions.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and there's a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes linearly with time based on speed and direction.\n\nImportant: when you move, you're only on the new freeway starting from the next turn. So if at turn T you move to y_{T+1}, you're still on y_T during turn T, and you arrive at y_{T+1} at the start of turn T+1. So for collision, at turn T, you're on y_T, so only cars on y_T matter at that turn.\n\nThe car update: for left-moving, span [h, τ] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] at turn T.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. In the table, for right-moving cars, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), and for right, head is the front, so for right-moving, span is [tail, head] I think? Let me see.\n\nIn the car state, for example, freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3). Since direction is right, and it says \"head at h, tail at τ\", and for right-moving, span is [τ, h] because it moves right, so tail is left end, head is right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving, from the table.\n\nLet me check the directions:\n\nFreeway 1: right\n\nFreeway 2: right\n\nFreeway 3: right\n\nFreeway 4: all right\n\nFreeway 5: all right\n\n6,7,8 all right-moving cars.\n\nSo all cars are right-moving, meaning they move to the right, so span at time t is [τ + s*(t - t1), h + s*(t - t1)]? No.\n\nAt turn T, span is [τ + s*(T - t1), h + s*(T - t1)] for right-moving, since it starts at [τ, h] at t1 and moves right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut here all are right, so for each car, at turn T, the left end is τ + s*(T - t1), right end is h + s*(T - t1).\n\nCollision if at turn T, player is on freeway k, and 0 is between left end and right end inclusive? Probably, since if the car covers x=0.\n\nThe problem says: \"collision occurs if 0 ∈ Span(T)\" for a car on the same freeway.\n\nAnd Span(T) is the interval where the car is.\n\nAlso, since the player is at x=0 always, only the y changes.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars there. y=0 to 8 have freeways? y=1 to 8 are freeways, y=0 and y=9 are not, I think. y=0 is the starting point, no cars, and y=9 is the goal, no cars. Only y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nThe problem says: \"freeways y = 1, …, 8\" and \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8\".\n\nAnd player at (0,y), with y from 0 to 9.\n\nSo y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nCollision only on y=1 to 8 if there's a car covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nNow, at turn t1=68, player is at (0,0).\n\nI need to go to (0,9).\n\nEach move changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nSince I start at y=0 and need to go to y=9, I must increase y by 9, so minimum 9 moves if all up, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more.\n\nBut I need minimal H.\n\nAlso, when I move, the turn I move, I'm on the current y, and I arrive at new y next turn.\n\nLet's denote the turns: let t=0 be turn t1=68, so at t=0, player is at y=0.\n\nThen after action a_0, at start of t=1, y is updated based on a_0.\n\nLet me define time steps.\n\nLet k be the step from t1.\n\nAt turn t1 + k for k=0,1,2,...\n\nAt the beginning of turn t1 + k, player position is y_k.\n\nThen during turn t1 + k, player chooses action a_{t1+k}, which determines y_{k+1} for the next turn.\n\nAfter action, at start of next turn, position changes.\n\nStandard way: at turn T, player is at position y_T, then chooses action a_T, which sets y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nThen for collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the cars on that row at that time.\n\nIn this case, for turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, and there is a car on freeway y_T with 0 in its span at time T.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I have the cars at t1=68.\n\nI need to find for each freeway, when x=0 is covered by a car.\n\nSince all cars move right at constant speed, I can find the times when a car covers x=0.\n\nFor each car, the span at time T is [τ + s*(T - t1), h + s*(T - t1)] for right-moving.\n\nThen 0 is in [left, right] if left <= 0 <= right.\n\nSo left <= 0 and 0 <= right.\n\nleft = τ + s*(T - t1)\n\nright = h + s*(T - t1)\n\nSo collision if left <= 0 <= right, i.e., τ + s*(T - t1) <= 0 and 0 <= h + s*(T - t1)\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nFrom left <= 0: τ + s*(T - t1) <= 0 ⇒ s*(T - t1) <= -τ ⇒ T - t1 <= -τ / s\n\nFrom 0 <= right: 0 <= h + s*(T - t1) ⇒ s*(T - t1) >= -h ⇒ T - t1 >= -h / s\n\nSo the time interval when collision happens for that car is from t1 + ceil(-h/s) to t1 + floor(-τ/s)? Let's be careful.\n\nT - t1 >= ceil(-h / s) ? No.\n\nT - t1 must satisfy:\n\nT - t1 >= -h / s\n\nand T - t1 <= -τ / s\n\nSince s > 0, and τ and h are positions.\n\nSince the car moves right, and τ is tail, h is head, so for right-moving, τ < h usually? In the values, let's see.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: h = -48, τ = -59, s=3, right.\n\nSo left = τ + s*(T-t1) = -59 + 3*(T-68)\n\nRight = -48 + 3*(T-68)\n\n0 in [left, right] when left <= 0 <= right\n\n-59 + 3*(T-68) <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 3*(T-68)\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 3*(T-68) <= 0 ⇒ 3*(T-68) <= 59 ⇒ T-68 <= 59/3 ≈ 19.666, so T-68 <= 19 since T integer? T is turn, so discrete.\n\nT - t1 is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nt1=68, T >=68.\n\nSo T - t1 is integer, say k = T - t1.\n\nThen for each car, collision when k such that:\n\n-59 + 3k <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 3k\n\nFirst: -59 + 3k <= 0 ⇒ 3k <= 59 ⇒ k <= 59/3 = 19.666, so k <= 19\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 3k ⇒ 3k >= 48 ⇒ k >= 16\n\nSo for k from 16 to 19 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nNow, let's list all cars and when they cover x=0.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: only one car: (-48, -59, right, 3) as above, collision when k=16 to 19.\n\nk = T - t1, so for freeway 1, car covers x=0 at k=16,17,18,19.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-48, -59, right, 3) identical, so same, collision k=16 to 19.\n\nFreeway 3: same, k=16 to 19.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nLeft = -59 + 4k\n\nRight = -48 + 4k\n\n0 in [left, right] if -59 + 4k <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 4k\n\nFirst: -59 + 4k <= 0 ⇒ 4k <= 59 ⇒ k <= 59/4 = 14.75, so k <= 14\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 4k ⇒ 4k >= 48 ⇒ k >= 12\n\nSo k=12,13,14\n\nSecond car on freeway 4: (-12, -23, right, 4)\n\nh = -12, τ = -23, s=4\n\nLeft = -23 + 4k\n\nRight = -12 + 4k\n\n0 in [left, right] if -23 + 4k <= 0 and 0 <= -12 + 4k\n\n-23 + 4k <= 0 ⇒ 4k <= 23 ⇒ k <= 23/4 = 5.75, so k <= 5\n\n0 <= -12 + 4k ⇒ 4k >= 12 ⇒ k >= 3\n\nSo k=3,4,5\n\nThird car on freeway 4: (24, 13, right, 4)? Head 24, tail 13? But for right-moving, if tail is τ and head is h, but usually tail should be left of head, but here h=24, τ=13, which is greater than τ? 13 and 24, 13<24, so tail=13, head=24, so left end is tail=13, right end head=24? But at t1, position is given.\n\nIn the car state: (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, at t1, head is at h, tail is at τ, and since moving right, tail should be less than head if right is positive.\n\nIn this case, for third car: h=24, τ=13, both positive, and s=4.\n\nLeft = τ + s k = 13 + 4k\n\nRight = h + s k = 24 + 4k\n\nNow, 0 in [left, right]? left=13+4k, which for k>=0, since k=T-t1>=0, left >=13>0, so 0 < left, so 0 never in [left, right] because left >0 always. So this car never covers x=0, since it starts at x=13 to 24 and moves right, so x>=13>0, never at 0. So safe, no collision from this car.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars with positive positions.\n\nNow, freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nh=-48, τ=-59, s=12\n\nLeft = τ + s k = -59 + 12k\n\nRight = -48 + 12k\n\n0 in [left, right] if -59 + 12k <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 12k\n\nFirst: -59 + 12k <= 0 ⇒ 12k <= 59 ⇒ k <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so k <= 4\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 12k ⇒ 12k >= 48 ⇒ k >= 4\n\nSo k=4 only.\n\nSecond car on freeway 5: (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nh=0, τ=-11, s=12\n\nLeft = τ + s k = -11 + 12k\n\nRight = h + s k = 0 + 12k\n\n0 in [left, right] if -11 + 12k <= 0 and 0 <= 12k\n\nFirst: -11 + 12k <= 0 ⇒ 12k <= 11 ⇒ k <= 11/12 ≈ 0.916, so k <= 0 since k integer >=0\n\nk=0: left = -11 +0 = -11, right=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included, since 0 <= right=0.\n\n0 <= right is 0 <= 0, which is true.\n\nAnd left <=0: -11 <=0 true.\n\nSo at k=0, collision if on freeway 5.\n\nk=0: T - t1 =0, so at turn t1, if player is on freeway 5, collision.\n\nBut at t1, player is at y=0, not on freeway 5, so no collision.\n\nNow for k>=1: at k=0, left=-11, right=0, so x=0 covered.\n\nFor k=1, left = -11 +12=1, right=12, both >0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly, for k>1, even higher.\n\nSo for this car, collision only at k=0.\n\nBut k=0 is turn t1, and player not on freeway 5, so safe.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5? Cars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nSame as above.\n\nFirst car: collision at k=4 only.\n\nSecond car: collision only at k=0.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 7 and 8: all have the same cars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nSo for each, first car collides at k=4, second at k=0, but k=0 not relevant.\n\nNow, let's summarize for each freeway, the times when there is a car covering x=0.\n\nThat is, for each y and k, if player on y at time k (relative to t1), collision if for that y, at that k, there is car with span covering 0.\n\nk = T - t1.\n\nPlayer position at time T is y_T.\n\nFor each freeway y, and for each k, we need to know if collision possible.\n\nSince multiple cars, but we care if at least one car covers x=0 at that time.\n\nFreeway 1: cars cover x=0 at k=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 2: same, k=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 3: same, k=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: covers at k=12,13,14\n\nSecond car: covers at k=3,4,5\n\nThird car: never\n\nSo for freeway 4, collision at k=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nFreeway 5: first car covers at k=4\n\nSecond car covers at k=0 only, not relevant for future.\n\nSo collision at k=4\n\nSimilarly freeway 6: same, collision at k=4 (from first car)\n\nFreeway 7: same, k=4\n\nFreeway 8: same, k=4\n\nNow, for freeway 5,6,7,8, at k=4, collision if on that row.\n\nBut at k=4, it might be covered.\n\nNow, player starts at y=0 at k=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, which can be reached by moving up.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nThe path: player must go from y=0 to y=9, passing through y=1 to y=8, but not necessarily all, since can skip by moving up or down.\n\ny changes by at most 1 per turn, so must visit intermediate y, but can stay or move.\n\nSince we start at y=0, need to end at y=9, and each move changes y by -1,0,+1, to go from 0 to 9, we need at least 9 up moves, and possibly some stay or down moves, but down moves would increase time, so to minimize H, probably avoid down moves, and minimize stay moves.\n\nH is the number of turns from t1 to when we reach y=9.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, y =9.\n\nLet’s define the sequence.\n\nAt turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, but at t=0, we are at position for turn t1, then we choose action a_{t1} which affects next position.\n\nPerhaps better to think in terms of positions.\n\nAt time k=0 (turn t1), position y=0.\n\nThen we choose action a_{t1} which sets y for k=1.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, y is updated.\n\nFor collision: at turn T = t1 + k, position y_k, and if 1<= y_k <=8, then we need that for freeway y_k, at time T, no car covers x=0.\n\nTime T corresponds to k.\n\nSince T = t1 + k.\n\nNow, we need to find a sequence of actions a_0, a_1, ..., up to when we reach y=9.\n\nLet the position at step m be y_m, for m=0,1,2,... with y_0 =0.\n\nThen at each step m, we choose action a_m, which sets y_{m+1} = y_m + delta, with delta in {-1,0,1}.\n\nThen at step m, position y_m, and we have collision if 1<= y_m <=8 and at time t1 + m, for freeway y_m, there is a car covering x=0.\n\nThen we need to reach some M such that y_M =9, and we stop.\n\nThe number of turns H is the number of actions? Let's see.\n\nFrom turn t1 to turn t1 + H -1, that's H turns.\n\nAt turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAt t=0, position y=0, we choose action a_{t1} which determines y at t=1.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, at turn t1 + H -1, we have position, and we want it to be 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t1 to t1 + H -1, that's H actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions for turn t1, t1+1, ..., up to t1 + H -1.\n\nAnd after last action, at turn t1 + H, position is set, but we care about position at turn t1 + H -1 being 9.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, position y, and after action, if y=9, we are done.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns from start to end.\n\nSince we need to increase y by 9, minimum H=9, with all U, y_m = m for m=0 to 9, but y_0=0, y_1=1, ..., y_9=9.\n\nAt step m, y_m, for m from 0 to 9.\n\nAt each m, time is t1 + m.\n\nCollision at time t1 + m if on freeway y_m and car covers x=0.\n\nFor all U, y_m = m.\n\nSo for m=0, y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nm=1, y=1, time k=m, since k=T-t1=m.\n\nAt time t1 + m, k=m.\n\nFor y=1, freeway 1, collision when k=16,17,18,19.\n\nBut for m=1, k=1, which is not in 16-19, so safe? k=1, freeway 1 collides at k=16-19, so at k=1, no collision on y=1.\n\nSimilarly, y=2, freeway 2, same, collides only at k=16-19, k=1 safe.\n\ny=3, freeway 3, same.\n\ny=4, freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 collides at k=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nAt m=4, y=4, k=4, which is in 3,4,5? k=4 is collision time for freeway 4.\n\nk=4, from above, freeway 4 has collision at k=3,4,5 and 12,13,14.\n\nSo at k=4, if on freeway 4, collision.\n\nIn all U, at step m=4, y=4, k=4, collision.\n\nSo cannot do all U, because at turn t1+4, y=4, and freeway 4 has car covering x=0.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5, freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 collides at k=4.\n\nAt m=5, y=5, k=5.\n\nFreeway 5 collision at k=4 only? k=4.\n\nAt k=5, no collision for freeway 5? From above, freeway 5: only at k=4 collision, from the first car.\n\nSecond car only k=0.\n\nSo at k=5, freeway 5 safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6,7,8 collide only at k=4.\n\nSo at k=5, all freeways 5-8 safe.\n\nBut for all U, at m=4, y=4, k=4, collision on freeway 4.\n\nSo need to avoid that.\n\nSimilarly, later at k=12-14 for y=4, but in all U, we pass y=4 at k=4, which is bad.\n\nSo must not be on y=4 at k=4.\n\nSimilarly, for other points.\n\nNow, to go from y=0 to y=9, min 9 steps, but may need to delay or change path.\n\nSince we can move down or stay, but that increases time, so probably better to go up but avoid the collision times.\n\nWe need to be on each freeway at times when it is safe.\n\nBut we don't have to be on all freeways, we can skip some by moving faster, but since we can only change by 1 per turn, we must visit every y between min and max, but we can go down, so not necessarily visit all.\n\nFor example, from y=3, if I go to y=4, then back to y=3, etc., but that wastes time, so for minimal H, probably no down moves, only up and possibly stay.\n\nBecause down moves would require more up moves later, increasing H.\n\nSimilarly, stay moves increase H.\n\nSo minimal H should have no down or stay, only up, but if not possible due to collisions, then add stay or down.\n\nBut down might be necessary to avoid multiple threats.\n\nFirst, let's list the unsafe times for each freeway.\n\nFor each y from 1 to 8, the k when collision occurs, i.e., unsafe to be on that y at that k.\n\ny=1: unsafe k=16,17,18,19\n\ny=2: same, k=16-19\n\ny=3: same, k=16-19\n\ny=4: unsafe k=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=5: unsafe k=4 (only)\n\ny=6: unsafe k=4\n\ny=7: unsafe k=4\n\ny=8: unsafe k=4\n\nAlso, for y=4, k=12,13,14 unsafe.\n\nNow, we start at k=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 by some k.\n\ny=9 can be reached at different times.\n\nThe position sequence y_m for m=0,1,2,... with y_0=0, y_{m+1} = y_m + a_m, a_m in {U,D,S}, so delta y in {+1,0,-1}, y between 0 and 9.\n\nAt each m, we are at position y_m, time k=m, and collision if 1<= y_m <=8 and unsafe at k=m for that y.\n\nTo reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMinimum m=9 with all U, but at m=4, y=4, k=4, unsafe, so not possible.\n\nSo need to spend more time.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=4 at k=4.\n\nSimilarly, being on y=5,6,7,8 at k=4 is unsafe, but k=4 is only unsafe for them, and for y=1,2,3 unsafe only later.\n\nNow, k=4 is a critical point.\n\nAt k=4, y=4,5,6,7,8 are all unsafe if on them.\n\ny=4 unsafe k=4, y=5 unsafe k=4, etc.\n\nOnly y=1,2,3 are safe at k=4, since they are unsafe only at k=16-19.\n\nAlso y=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nSo at k=4, if we are on y=0,1,2,3, safe, but not on 4-8.\n\nSimilarly, for other times.\n\nNow, we start at m=0, k=0, y=0, safe.\n\nWe need to go up.\n\nBut if we go up to y=1 at m=1, y=1, k=1, safe since y=1 unsafe only k=16-19.\n\nSimilarly, to y=2 at m=2, k=2, safe.\n\nTo y=3 at m=3, k=3, y=3, safe? y=3 unsafe k=16-19, k=3 safe.\n\nBut at k=3, for y=4, it is unsafe, but we are not on y=4 yet.\n\nAt m=3, if y=3.\n\nThen at m=4, k=4, if we go to y=4, collision, since y=4 unsafe at k=4.\n\nIf we stay, y=3 at k=4, y=3 is safe at k=4, since unsafe only later.\n\nThen at m=5, k=5, if we go to y=4, but at k=5, y=4 is unsafe? Freeway 4 unsafe at k=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nSo k=5, y=4 unsafe.\n\nIf we stay at y=3, at m=4, y=3, k=4, safe.\n\nThen at m=5, k=5, if we go to y=4, y=4 at k=5, unsafe because k=5 is unsafe for y=4.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to y=2, but that might be worse.\n\nAt m=5, k=5, if we are at y=3, and we go to y=4, unsafe.\n\nBut if we stay at y=3, y=3 at k=5, k=5, y=3 unsafe? y=3 unsafe only at k=16-19, k=5<16, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can stay at y=3 for a while.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nNow, freeway 4 is unsafe from k=3 to5 and k=12 to14.\n\nSo to cross y=4, we need to be on y=4 at k not in {3,4,5,12,13,14}, so k<=2 or 6<=k<=11 or k>=15.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\ny=5 unsafe only at k=4, so safe at other times.\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8 unsafe only at k=4, safe otherwise.\n\ny=1,2,3 unsafe at k=16-19, safe otherwise.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nWe can stay at y=3 until k=5 is over.\n\nFor example, at m=3, k=3, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at m=4, k=4, we can choose S, so y=3 at k=4, safe.\n\nThen at m=5, k=5, we can choose S again, y=3 at k=5, safe.\n\nThen at m=6, k=6, we can go U to y=4.\n\nAt k=6, y=4, is it safe? Freeway 4 unsafe at k=3,4,5,12,13,14. k=6 not in, so safe.\n\nThen we can proceed.\n\nBut we have to deal with later unsafe times.\n\nFirst, let's continue.\n\nAt m=6, k=6, y=4, safe.\n\nThen go U to y=5 at m=7, k=7, y=5.\n\ny=5 unsafe only at k=4, so k=7 safe.\n\nSimilarly, to y=6 at m=8, k=8, safe.\n\ny=7 at m=9, k=9, safe.\n\ny=8 at m=10, k=10, safe? y=8 unsafe only at k=4, k=10>4, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at m=11, k=11, y=9, done.\n\nBut y=9 at m=11.\n\nNow, is there any problem? We have y=4 at k=6, which is safe, and we avoided k=3,4,5 for y=4.\n\nBut later, for y=4, there is unsafe at k=12,13,14, but we are on y=4 at k=6, which is before, so no issue.\n\nIn this path, we reached y=9 at m=11.\n\nBut m=11, so H-1=11? Let's see.\n\ny_0=0 at k=0\n\ny_1=1 at k=1\n\ny_2=2 at k=2\n\ny_3=3 at k=3\n\nThen a_3 = S, so y_4=3 at k=4 (since stayed)\n\ny_4=3 at k=4\n\nThen a_4 = S, y_5=3 at k=5\n\nThen a_5 = U, y_6=4 at k=6\n\na_6 = U, y_7=5 at k=7\n\na_7 = U, y_8=6 at k=8\n\na_8 = U, y_9=7 at k=9\n\na_9 = U, y_10=8 at k=10\n\na_10 = U, y_11=9 at k=11\n\nAt y_11=9, which is at turn t1 + 11, so we reached at step m=11, with y_m=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from a_0 to a_10, that's 11 actions, for turns t1 to t1+10.\n\nAt turn t1 + t for t=0 to 10, positions from y=0 to y=10? Let's list turns:\n\nTurn t1 + 0: position y=0, choose action a0\n\nTurn t1 + 1: position y1, choose action a1\n\n...\n\nTurn t1 + 10: position y10, choose action a10, which sets y11=9.\n\nAfter action a10, at turn t1+11, position is y11=9.\n\nBut we want at turn t1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nIn this case, at turn t1 + 10, position is y10=8, not 9.\n\nAfter action a10 at turn t1+10, position becomes 9 at turn t1+11.\n\nSo at turn t1+11, position is 9.\n\nTherefore, H-1 = 11? No.\n\nt1 + H -1 is the turn where position is 9.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn T, position at T.\n\nAt turn T = t1 + k, position y_k.\n\nWe want for some k, y_k =9.\n\nIn the action sequence, actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1, after H actions, position at turn t1+H is set, but we care about position at turn t1+H-1 being 9? I think I have confusion.\n\nLet me read the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n\" such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAlso, \"after H-1 actions\" or something.\n\nLet's see: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t from 0 to H-1, that's H actions.\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter the actions, the position at turn t1 + H - 1 is 9.\n\nIn terms of steps: at turn t1 + s, position y_s.\n\nAfter action at turn t1+s, y_{s+1} is set.\n\nBut position at turn t1+s is y_s.\n\nWe want y_K =9 for K = t1 + H -1? Notation.\n\nSet s as the turn index from t1.\n\nAt turn t1 + s, for s=0,1,2,...\n\nPosition y_s.\n\nThen we choose action a_{t1+s}, which sets y_{s+1} = y_s + delta.\n\nFor collision at turn t1+s, it depends on y_s and the cars at that time.\n\nWe want for some S, y_S =9, and S should be t1 + H -1, so H-1 = S.\n\ny_S =9 at turn t1 + S.\n\nThen H-1 = S, so S = H-1.\n\nThe number of turns from t1 to t1 + S is S+1 turns, but actions from s=0 to s=S-1? Let's see.\n\nActions: from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -1, that's H actions: a_{t1+0} to a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAfter these actions, at turn t1 + H, position is set, but we care about position at turn t1 + H -1 being 9.\n\nPosition at turn t1 + H -1 is y_{H-1}, and it should be 9.\n\nAnd after action a_{t1+H-1}, y_H is set, but we don't care as long as y_{H-1}=9.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t1 + s, for s from 0 to H-1, we have position y_s, and we choose action a_s.\n\nAt s=H-1, position y_{H-1} =9.\n\nAnd for s<H-1, y_s may not be 9.\n\nIn my earlier notation, I had m from 0, y_m at step m, which is turn t1 + m.\n\nSo y_m at turn t1 + m.\n\nWe want y_M =9 for some M, and M = H-1.\n\nSo H-1 = M.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to t=M-1? Actions for turns t1+0 to t1+H-1, which is s=0 to s=H-1.\n\nAt turn s, position y_s, choose action a_s.\n\nAfter a_{H-1}, y_H is set, but y_H may not be 9, but we don't care, since we stop when y_s=9 for s=H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at turn t1 + H -1, and at that turn, position is 9.\n\nFor example, if we reach at turn T, y_T=9, then H-1 = T - t1, so H = T - t1 +1.\n\nNumber of turns from t1 to T is T - t1 +1, which is H.\n\nActions from turn t1 to turn T, that's T - t1 +1 actions.\n\nAnd at turn T, position is 9.\n\nIn my path, I had y_11=9 at k=11, so M=11, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nLet's clarify with the all U case.\n\nIf all U, y_m = m, at m=9, y_9=9, so M=9, H-1=9, H=10 actions? Turn t1+0 to t1+9, 10 turns.\n\nAt turn t1+0: y=0\n\nAction U, to y=1 at t1+1\n\n...\n\nAt turn t1+8: y=8, action U, to y=9 at t1+9\n\nAt turn t1+9: y=9, position is 9.\n\nAnd we have actions from t1+0 to t1+8? For turn t1+0 to t1+8, that's 9 actions, to reach y=9 at turn t1+9.\n\nBut y_{t1+9} =9, so t1+H-1 = t1+9, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nAnd actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to 9-1=8? H-1=9, so t from 0 to H-1=9? H=10, t from 0 to 9.\n\nt from 0 to H-1.\n\nH-1=9, so t=0 to 9, 10 actions.\n\nAt turn t1+t for t=0 to 9, positions from y at t1+0 to y at t1+9.\n\nAt turn t1+t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} set.\n\nAt turn t1+9, position y_9=9.\n\nAnd actions a_t for t=0 to 9, but a_t chosen at turn t1+t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t1+t, we specify action a_{t1+t}.\n\nFor t from 0 to H-1.\n\nIn all U, H=10, actions: for t=0 to 8, a=U, and at t=9, but H-1=9, t from 0 to 9, but at turn t1+9, position is already 9, so no action needed? But we need to specify actions until we reach.\n\nIn the sequence, actions are chosen until the turn before we reach, but here at turn t1+9, we are at y=9, so we might not need an action, but the action sequence is to be executed to reach the position.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that we perform actions for turns until the position is 9 at that turn.\n\nFor example, in all U, we perform 9 actions: at turns t1 to t1+8, all U, and at turn t1+9, position is 9.\n\nSo actions for t=0 to 8, H=9 actions? But H is number of turns, I think.\n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"sequence of actions for t=0 to H-1\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo in all U, at turn t1+9, y=9, so t1+H-1 = t1+9, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen actions for t=0 to 9, but at t=9, turn t1+9, position is 9, and we choose action, but since we are at 9, we might choose S or U, but if U, y=10 not possible, since y<=9, so must choose S or D, but D to 8, not good, so S.\n\nBut in the context, when we reach y=9, we can choose S to stay, but the position at that turn is 9.\n\nIn the sequence, for the last turn, we are at 9 and choose an action, but it doesn't change the position if we stay.\n\nBut to reach at that turn, we need to have the position 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn my earlier path, I had y_11=9 at k=11, so M=11, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nThen actions for t=0 to 11? t from 0 to H-1=11.\n\nH-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions for s=0 to 11.\n\nAt turn t1+s for s=0 to 11, with position at that turn.\n\nIn the path I described:\n\nAt s=0 (turn t1), y=0, choose action\n\ns=1, y=1, choose action\n\n...\n\ns=3, y=3, choose action\n\ns=4, y=3 (after S), choose action\n\ns=5, y=3 (after another S), choose action\n\ns=6, y=4, choose action\n\ns=7, y=5, choose action\n\ns=8, y=6, choose action\n\ns=9, y=7, choose action\n\ns=10, y=8, choose action\n\ns=11, y=9, choose action (say S)\n\nAt s=11, y=9, so position at turn t1+11 is 9.\n\nH-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions from s=0 to s=11, but at s=11, we are at y=9, and we choose an action, but it's fine.\n\nTo avoid the last action, we can reach earlier.\n\nBut in this case, with 11 steps to position 9.\n\nBut we can do better?\n\nIn this path, we used two stays at y=3, so from s=3 to s=5, y=3, so we spent extra turns.\n\nTotal to y=9, min 9, we took 12 turns? s from 0 to 11, 12 positions, but y from 0 to 9, with stays.\n\nNumber of up moves: from 0 to 9, 9 up moves, and we have 2 stay moves, so total actions: 9 U and 2 S, 11 actions? Positions: at s=0, y=0; after 11 actions, y=9 at s=11.\n\nFrom s=0 to s=11, 12 states, 11 actions.\n\ny_0=0, after a0, y1=1; ... after a10, y11=9.\n\nActions a0 to a10, 11 actions.\n\nThen at turn t1+11, y=9, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, from t1 to t1+11, that's 12 turns? Turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+11, that's 12 turns.\n\nPosition at turn t1+k for k=0 to 11.\n\nAt k=0, y=0; k=1, y=1; ... k=3, y=3; k=4, y=3; k=5, y=3; k=6, y=4; k=7, y=5; k=8, y=6; k=9, y=7; k=10, y=8; k=11, y=9.\n\nSo at k=11, y=9, so turn t1+11, position 9.\n\nThus H-1=11, H=12.\n\nBut we can reach earlier.\n\nFor example, at k=4, we are at y=3, but if we could be higher.\n\nBut at k=4, we cannot be on y=4 or above, so maximum y=3 at k=4.\n\nSimilarly, at k=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom k=0 to k=4, in 4 steps, we can reach at most y=4, but at k=4, y=4 unsafe, so we must be at y<=3 at k=4.\n\nWith min moves, at k=4, y<=4, but y=4 unsafe, so y<=3.\n\nSimilarly, at k=3, y<=3, which is safe for y=3.\n\nThen from k=4 onwards, we can go up.\n\nBut at k=5, if we go to y=4, but k=5, y=4 unsafe, so we need to wait.\n\nWe can go to y=5 directly or something.\n\nFrom y=3 at k=4, if we go U to y=4 at k=5, but k=5, y=4 unsafe.\n\nIf we go U at k=4 from y=3 to y=4 at k=5? At k=4, we are at y=3, choose action U, then at k=5, y=4.\n\nBut at k=5, y=4 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose S at k=4, stay y=3 at k=5.\n\nThen at k=5, y=3, choose U, to y=4 at k=6.\n\nAt k=6, y=4 safe, as before.\n\nBut we lost two turns: from k=3 to k=5, we stayed at y=3, while we could have been higher.\n\nAt k=3, we are at y=3.\n\nInstead of staying, can we go down? But going down would make us go away from goal, so worse.\n\nSo we need to stay at y=3 until k=5.\n\nk=5 is unsafe for y=4, but at k=6 it is safe.\n\nAnother idea: go faster to y=3, but we are at y=3 at k=3, which is the earliest.\n\nStart at k=0, y=0, go U to y=1 at k=1, U to y=2 at k=2, U to y=3 at k=3. That's min.\n\nThen we have to stay at y=3 for k=4 and k=5, so at k=6 go to y=4.\n\nThen from there up to y=9 at k=11 as before.\n\nBut we have later unsafe times for y=4 at k=12-14, but we are on y=4 at k=6, which is fine.\n\ny=1,2,3 have unsafe at k=16-19, but we pass them early, k=1,2,3 <16, so safe.\n\nSo this path seems ok with H=12.\n\nBut can we do with less?\n\nSuppose we go slower at the beginning.\n\nFor example, at k=0, y=0, instead of U, we stay or something, but that would make us later.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr go down, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=4 at a safe time earlier or later.\n\nBut at k=3, y=4 unsafe; k=4 unsafe; k=5 unsafe.\n\nk=2 is safe for y=4? Freeway 4 unsafe k=3,4,5,12,13,14, so k=2 is safe.\n\nBut can we be on y=4 at k=2?\n\nAt k=2, we need y=4.\n\nBut from k=0, y=0, to k=2, y=4, that means two up moves, but y from 0 to 4 in two steps? Impossible, since each move changes by at most 1.\n\ny_0=0, after one move y1<=1, after two moves y2<=2, so at k=2, y<=2, cannot be y=4.\n\nSimilarly, at k=1, y<=1.\n\nSo at k=2, y<=2, cannot reach y=4.\n\nSimilarly, at k=6, y=4 is possible, as in the path.\n\nAfter k=5, we can go.\n\nBut we have the unsafe period for y=4 at k=12-14.\n\nIn the path, we are on y=4 at k=6, which is before k=12, so no issue.\n\nIf we delay going to y=4 until after k=14, but that would be later, so worse.\n\nFor example, if we stay at lower y longer, then go up later, but k=16-19 for y=1-3 are unsafe, so we need to pass them before k=16 or after k=19.\n\nBut after k=19, it takes more time.\n\nSince we pass early, it's fine.\n\nIn the current path, we reach at k=11.\n\nBut we can go faster after k=5.\n\nIn the path, from k=5 to k=11: at k=5, y=3; k=6, y=4; k=7, y=5; ... k=11, y=9.\n\nThat's 6 steps from y=3 to y=9, which takes 6 moves, min is 6, since 6 up moves.\n\ny from 3 to 9, difference 6, so min 6 moves.\n\nWe did U all the way, so no waste.\n\nBut from k=3 to k=5, we stayed at y=3 for two extra turns.\n\nIf we can avoid that, we save.\n\nBut how? We need to not be on y=4 at k=4, but at k=4, if we are not on y=4, and not on y=5,6,7,8, so must be on y=0,1,2,3.\n\nAt k=3, we are at y=3, if we go U at k=3, to y=4 at k=4, collision.\n\nIf we go S, stay y=3 at k=4.\n\nThen at k=4, we are at y=3, if we go U, to y=4 at k=5, collision at k=5.\n\nSo we must not go to y=4 at k=4 or k=5.\n\nThus, at k=4, we must not choose U if y=3, or if y=2, going U to y=3 at k=5, but y=3 at k=5 is safe, but then we need to go to y=4 later.\n\nSuppose at k=3, we are at y=3, we choose D to y=2 at k=4.\n\nThen at k=4, y=2, which is safe (since y=2 unsafe only k=16-19).\n\nThen at k=4, we can choose U to y=3 at k=5.\n\nAt k=5, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at k=5, we can choose U to y=4 at k=6.\n\nAt k=6, y=4, safe.\n\nThen same as before, to y=5 at k=7, etc., to y=9 at k=11.\n\nBut we did an extra down and up, so same number of turns: from k=3 to k=5, we went to y=2 and back, so we have y=2 at k=4 and y=3 at k=5, then to y=4 at k=6.\n\nCompared to staying at y=3 for k=4 and k=5, it's the same: at k=4 and k=5, y=3 in first case, or y=2 and y=3 in second, but in both, at k=6 we go to y=4.\n\nAnd we used one D and one U instead of two S, but in terms of reaching y=9, same time.\n\nBut with D, we have unnecessary move, but time same.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nSo the stay is fine.\n\nBut in terms of actions, we have to specify.\n\nNow, back to the unsafe k=12-14 for y=4.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=4 at k=6, which is not 12-14, so safe.\n\nIf we were to be on y=4 later, it might be unsafe, but we are not.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nBut in this path, we have to worry about y=1,2,3 at k=16-19, but we pass them at k=1,2,3, which is before 16, so safe.\n\nSo H=12 seems ok.\n\nBut can we reach earlier by going to higher y before k=4?\n\nBut at k=4, we cannot be above y=3, as established.\n\nAt k=0, y=0\n\nk=1, y=1\n\nk=2, y=2\n\nk=3, y=3\n\nThen we need to stay or something until k=6 to go to y=4.\n\nk=6 y=4.\n\nThen from there, min to y=9 is 5 more steps? y=4 to y=9, 5 up moves, at k=7 y=5, k=8 y=6, k=9 y=7, k=10 y=8, k=11 y=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf we could be at y=3 earlier, but we are at k=3, min.\n\nPerhaps we can start by staying at y=0 for some turns, but that delays, worse.\n\nSo H=12 seems minimal? But let's see if we can do with H=11.\n\nH=11 means y_{10} =9 at k=10.\n\nThen y_k for k=0 to 10, with y_0=0, y_10=9.\n\nThe sum of delta y must be +9.\n\nEach U +1, D -1, S 0.\n\nNumber of U minus number of D =9.\n\nTotal actions: let P be number of U, Q number of D, R number of S, P - Q =9, and P + Q + R =10 (since 10 actions to go from k=0 to k=10? Positions from k=0 to k=10, 11 positions, 10 actions.\n\ny_0=0, after 10 actions, y_10=9.\n\nSo P - Q =9, and P + Q + R =10.\n\nThen P =9 + Q, so 9 + Q + Q + R =10, 9 + 2Q + R =10, so 2Q + R =1.\n\nSo possible: Q=0, R=1; or Q=1, R=-1 impossible; or Q=0, R=1.\n\n2Q + R =1, so either Q=0, R=1; or Q=1, R=-1 impossible; or Q=0.5 impossible.\n\nSo only possibility: Q=0, R=1, P=9.\n\nSo one stay and nine up moves.\n\nNow, y increases by 1 each up move, but with one stay, so we have to stay at some y for one turn.\n\nNow, we need to be safe at each position.\n\ny must be between 0 and 9.\n\nStart y=0, after actions, y=9.\n\nWith P=9 U, R=1 S, Q=0.\n\nThe stay can be at some point.\n\nNow, we need to avoid collisions.\n\nSpecifically, at k=4, we cannot be on y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut at k=4, if we are on y=4 to 8, unsafe.\n\ny=0,1,2,3 safe.\n\nSimilarly, at other times.\n\nNow, with 10 steps from k=0 to k=10.\n\ny_k: since we have one stay, y increases 9 times, stays once.\n\nSo the position: it stays at some y for two consecutive k.\n\nFor example, at some s, y_s = y_{s+1}, and for other, y_{i+1} = y_i +1.\n\nNow, we need to be at y=9 at k=10.\n\nSince we start from y=0 at k=0, and increase to y=9 at k=10, with one stay.\n\nThe stay must be at y between 0 and 8, since after stay, we go up.\n\nIf we stay at y, then y_s = y, y_{s+1} = y, then from there up.\n\nThe earliest we can be at high y is limited by the min move.\n\nFor example, at k=4, we must be at y<=3, because if y=4, unsafe; y=5,6,7,8 unsafe; y=3 safe.\n\nSimilarly, at k=3, y<=3, safe if y=3.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 at k=10.\n\nFrom k=4 to k=10, 6 steps.\n\ny at k=4 <=3.\n\nThen from k=4 to k=10, 6 steps to increase from y<=3 to y=9, difference at least 6, so must increase by exactly 6, so no stay or down during this period, all up moves.\n\nThus, from k=4 to k=10, we must have y_{k+1} = y_k +1 for k=4 to9, so y_5 = y_4 +1, y_6 = y_5 +1, ..., up to y_10 = y_9 +1.\n\nSince y_10=9, then y_9=8, y_8=7, ..., down to y_4.\n\ny_10=9, y_9=8 (since y_10 = y_9 +1), y_8=7, y_7=6, y_6=5, y_5=4, y_4=3.\n\ny_4 must be 3.\n\nBecause if y_4 <=2, then y_5 <=3, y_6<=4, ..., y_10<=8<9, contradiction.\n\ny_4 <=3, but if y_4=2, y_5=3, y_6=4, ..., y_10=8<9.\n\nIf y_4=3, y_5=4, y_6=5, y_7=6, y_8=7, y_9=8, y_10=9.\n\nSimilarly, if y_4=1, worse.\n\nSo must have y_4=3, y_5=4, y_6=5, y_7=6, y_8=7, y_9=8, y_10=9.\n\nNow, at k=4, y_4=3, safe.\n\nAt k=5, y_5=4, but k=5, y=4, freeway 4 unsafe at k=5, collision!\n\nProblem.\n\ny_5=4 at k=5, but k=5 is unsafe for y=4.\n\nSo collision.\n\nIf we had the stay earlier, but in this sequence, from k=4 to k=10, all up, no stay possible, since we used the stay before k=4.\n\nIn this H=11 case, we have one stay in the first 4 steps.\n\ny from k=0 to k=4.\n\ny_0=0\n\ny_4=3\n\nWith 4 steps, from y=0 to y=3, min 3 up moves, but we have 4 actions? Positions: k=0 to k=4, 5 positions, 4 actions.\n\ny_0=0, after 4 actions, y_4=3.\n\nSince P=9 U total, but in first part.\n\nFrom k=0 to k=4, positions y_0 to y_4, with 4 actions.\n\ny_4=3.\n\nSince we go from y=0 to y=3, we need at least 3 up moves.\n\nWith 4 actions, we can have 3 U and 1 S, or 2 U and 2 S, etc., but since P=9 U total, and later 6 U from k=4 to k=9 actions? Let's see actions.\n\nActions from step k to k+1.\n\nActions a_k for k=0 to 9? For H=11, actions a_s for s=0 to 10? H=11, actions t=0 to 10? Earlier.\n\ny_k at turn k.\n\nAfter a_k, y_{k+1} set.\n\nWe have y_10=9.\n\nActions a_0 to a_9, 10 actions.\n\ny_0=0\n\ny_1 after a_0\n\n...\n\ny_10 after a_9\n\nWith P=9 U, Q=0 D, R=1 S.\n\nNow, y_4=3, as above.\n\ny_5=4 after a_4\n\nBut at k=5, position y_5=4, and k=5, unsafe for y=4.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf we have the stay at k=4, but y_4=3, if we choose S, then y_5=3, but then y_5=3, not 4, but we need y_5=4 for the sequence.\n\nIn the required sequence for H=11, we must have y_5=4 to reach y_10=9 with all up.\n\nBut y_5=4 at k=5 unsafe.\n\nIf we have the stay later, but after k=4, we cannot have stay, because from k=4 to k=10, we need all up to increase from 3 to 9 in 6 steps.\n\ny_4=3, y_5=4, y_6=5, ..., y_10=9, no room for stay.\n\nThe only stay must be before k=4.\n\nBut with stay before k=4, we still have the problem at k=5.\n\nUnless we can have y_5 not 4, but it must be.\n\nPerhaps the stay at k=5, but if at k=5, y_5=4, and we choose S, y_6=4, but then y_6=4, not 5, so y_7=5, ..., y_10=8, not 9.\n\nThen to reach y=9, we need another step.\n\nBut for H=11, y_10=9, not possible if we stay.\n\nIn this case, with one stay, if we stay at some point, we reach y=9 later.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=3 at k=4, then y_4=3, y_5=3 (after S), then we need to go up, y_6=4, etc., but y_10=8 if we go all up, then y_11=9, which is H=12.\n\nIf we stay earlier, similar.\n\nSo it seems impossible to reach y=9 at k=10.\n\nThus H=11 impossible.\n\nH=12 is possible as before.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nIn the path:\n\nAt turn t1 + s:\n\ns=0: position y=0, choose action: since we go to y=1, action U\n\ns=1: position y=1, choose action U to y=2\n\ns=2: position y=2, choose action U to y=3\n\ns=3: position y=3, now at k=3, safe. We need to stay, so choose action S, so y=3 next.\n\ns=4: position y=3, choose action S again, so y=3 next.\n\ns=5: position y=3, choose action U to y=4\n\ns=6: position y=4, choose U to y=5\n\ns=7: position y=5, choose U to y=6\n\ns=8: position y=6, choose U to y=7\n\ns=9: position y=7, choose U to y=8\n\ns=10: position y=8, choose U to y=9\n\ns=11: position y=9, and we need to specify action, but since y=9, we can choose S.\n\nNow, at s=11, position is 9, so for H, t1 + H -1 = t1 +11, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions for s=0 to s=11, but at s=11, position is 9, and we choose action for that turn.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from turn t1 to t1+11.\n\nBut the last action at t1+11 is not necessary, but we have to specify until we reach.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be fine.\n\nTo have y=9 at s=10, but we saw it's impossible with collision.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps go to y=4 at k=6, but then go faster, but from y=4 to y=9, min 5 moves, at k=7 to k=11, y=5 to9, same as before.\n\nIf we can reach y=4 earlier, but cannot.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 4, k=6 is safe, but we can be on y=4 at other safe times, but earlier not possible.\n\nSo I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nNow, but we have the car on freeway 4 at k=12-14 unsafe, but we are not on it, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5,6,7,8, only unsafe at k=4, which we avoid.\n\nIn the path, at k=7, y=5, safe; k=8 y=6 safe, etc.\n\nNow, the actions:\n\nFor turn t1 + t, action a_{t1+t}\n\nt=0: U\n\nt=1: U\n\nt=2: U\n\nt=3: S  (stay at y=3)\n\nt=4: S  (stay at y=3)\n\nt=5: U  (to y=4)\n\nt=6: U  (to y=5)\n\nt=7: U  (to y=6)\n\nt=8: U  (to y=7)\n\nt=9: U  (to y=8)\n\nt=10: U (to y=9)\n\nt=11: but at t=10, we go to y=9 at s=11, so at turn t1+10, position y=8, we choose U, to y=9 at t1+11.\n\nThen at turn t1+11, position y=9.\n\nFor the action sequence, we need up to when position is set to 9 at that turn.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to t=10 for turns t1 to t1+10.\n\nAfter a_{t1+10}, y=9 at t1+11.\n\nBut position at turn t1+10 is y=8, not 9.\n\nWe want position at turn t1 + H -1 =9.\n\nHere at turn t1+11, position=9, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions for t=0 to 11.\n\nAt t=11, turn t1+11, position y=9, we choose action, say S.\n\nIn the answer, we can specify.\n\nTo save, we don't need the last action, but the problem asks for actions until we reach, including the turn when we arrive? No.\n\nThe sequence of actions to reach, so the actions that bring us there.\n\nIn this case, with actions from t=0 to t=10, we have positions from y=0 to y=8 at turns t1 to t1+10, and y=9 at t1+11.\n\nSo to have y at turn t1+10 be 9, we need to be there earlier.\n\nBut we cannot with collision.\n\nSo H=12 is fine.\n\nNow, but in the car list, for freeway 4, there is a car at k=12-14 unsafe, but we don't care.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5,6,7,8, only k=4 unsafe.\n\nIn the path, no issue.\n\nBut let's list the actions clearly.\n\nCurrent turn t1=68.\n\nWe need actions for turn 68 to 68 + H -1.\n\nWith H=12, so turns 68 to 79.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: S  (stay, since at y=3)\n\nTurn 72: S  (stay at y=3)\n\nTurn 73: U  (to y=4)\n\nTurn 74: U  (to y=5)\n\nTurn 75: U  (to y=6)\n\nTurn 76: U  (to y=7)\n\nTurn 77: U  (to y=8)\n\nTurn 78: U  (to y=9)\n\nTurn 79: ? At turn 78, we choose U, to y=9 at turn 79.\n\nAt turn 79, position y=9, so we need to include action for turn 79, say S.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 79, action S.\n\nThen position at turn 79 is 9.\n\nH-1=79-68=11, H=12.\n\nActions from turn 68 to 79.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed.\n\nBut to write the sequence.\n\nIn the minimal, is there a way with H=11?\n\nSuppose we stay at y=0 for one turn.\n\nBut then we start later, worse.\n\nFor example, at k=0, y=0, choose S, then y=0 at k=1.\n\nThen go up, at k=1, y=0 or1? After S, y1=0.\n\nThen U to y=1 at k=2, U to y=2 at k=3, U to y=3 at k=4.\n\nThen at k=4, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at k=4, choose U? to y=4 at k=5, but k=5 y=4 unsafe.\n\nChoose S, y=3 at k=5, then U to y=4 at k=6, same as before, but we started later, so reach later.\n\nFor example, y at k=0:0, k=1:0 (after S), k=2:1, k=3:2, k=4:3, k=5:3 (S), k=6:4, ..., up to y=9 at k=12, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo H=12 is best.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=4 at k=6, but then to y=9 at k=11, but y=4 to y=9 in 5 moves: k=6 y=4, k=7 y=5, ..., k=11 y=9, yes, but we need to get to y=4 at k=6.\n\nFrom start, k=0 y=0 to k=6 y=4.\n\nMin 4 up moves, but with 6 steps, so we can have stays or down.\n\nBut to be at y=4 at k=6, from y=0 at k=0.\n\nWith 6 actions, y from 0 to 4, so we need 4 up moves and possibly down or stay, but down would require more up, so better to have stay.\n\nFor example, 4 U and 2 S, or something.\n\nBut at k=4, we need to be not on y=4-8, so y<=3.\n\nSimilarly, k=5, not on y=4 if we go there, but at k=5, y=4 unsafe.\n\nIn this case, to reach y=4 at k=6.\n\nFor example: k=0 y=0 U to k=1 y=1\n\nk=1 y=1 U to k=2 y=2\n\nk=2 y=2 U to k=3 y=3\n\nk=3 y=3 S to k=4 y=3\n\nk=4 y=3 S to k=5 y=3\n\nk=5 y=3 U to k=6 y=4\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf we can have less delay, but we must avoid k=4 and k=5 for y=4, but since we go at k=6, it's fine.\n\nSo I think it's optimal.\n\nThus, minimal H=12.\n\nNow, the actions:\n\nFor turn t1=68:\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: S  (at y=3, stay)\n\nTurn 72: S  (stay at y=3)\n\nTurn 73: U  (to y=4)\n\nTurn 74: U  (to y=5)\n\nTurn 75: U  (to y=6)\n\nTurn 76: U  (to y=7)\n\nTurn 77: U  (to y=8)\n\nTurn 78: U  (to y=9)\n\nAt turn 78, action U, to y=9 at turn 79.\n\nBut at turn 79, position y=9, so for the sequence, we need to include turn 79 action.\n\nSince at turn 78, position y=8, we choose U to go to 9.\n\nThen at turn 79, we are at y=9, and we can choose S or something.\n\nIn the answer, for turn 79, we specify action, say S.\n\nBut the position at turn 79 is 9, so H-1=79-68=11, H=12.\n\nActions for turn 68 to 79.\n\nIn the sequence, we can write:\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: S\n\nTurn 72: S\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: S  (since at y=9, stay)\n\nBut the last action is not necessary, but we include it.\n\nTo avoid, we could have reached at turn 78, but not possible.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 78, we go to y=9, so position at turn 78 is y=8.\n\nNot 9.\n\nSo we need turn 79.\n\nNow, for the car states, we need to make sure no collision.\n\nFor example, at turn 68+0=68, y=0, safe.\n\nTurn 69, y=1, k=1, freeway 1 safe.\n\nTurn 70, y=2, k=2, freeway 2 safe.\n\nTurn 71, y=3, k=3, freeway 3 safe.\n\nTurn 72, y=3, k=4, freeway? y=3, but freeway 3 is for y=3, at k=4, is it safe? y=3 unsafe only at k=16-19, k=4<16, safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 73: at k=5? Turn 73 is t1 +5? t1=68, turn 73 is 68+5=73, k=5.\n\nPosition: at turn 73, after action? Turn 73: position y, then choose action.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt turn 68 (k=0), position y=0, action U, so at turn 69 (k=1), position y=1\n\nTurn 69 (k=1), position y=1, action U, at turn 70 (k=2) position y=2\n\nTurn 70 (k=2), position y=2, action U, at turn 71 (k=3) position y=3\n\nTurn 71 (k=3), position y=3, action S, so at turn 72 (k=4) position y=3\n\nTurn 72 (k=4), position y=3, action S, so at turn 73 (k=5) position y=3\n\nTurn 73 (k=5), position y=3, action U, so at turn 74 (k=6) position y=4\n\nTurn 74 (k=6), position y=4, action U, at turn 75 (k=7) position y=5\n\n...\n\nAt turn 78 (k=10), position y=8, action U, at turn 79 (k=11) position y=9\n\nAt turn 79 (k=11), position y=9, action S, say.\n\nNow, collisions:\n\nAt each turn, position and k.\n\nk=0, turn 68, y=0, safe\n\nk=1, turn 69, y=1, freeway 1, unsafe only k=16-19, k=1 safe\n\nk=2, turn 70, y=2, safe\n\nk=3, turn 71, y=3, safe\n\nk=4, turn 72, y=3, freeway 3, safe\n\nk=5, turn 73, y=3, freeway 3, safe (k=5<16)\n\nk=6, turn 74, y=4, freeway 4, k=6, not unsafe (unsafe k=3,4,5,12,13,14), k=6 safe\n\nk=7, turn 75, y=5, freeway 5, unsafe only k=4, k=7 safe\n\nk=8, turn 76, y=6, freeway 6, unsafe only k=4, k=8 safe\n\nk=9, turn 77, y=7, freeway 7, safe\n\nk=10, turn 78, y=8, freeway 8, unsafe only k=4, k=10 safe\n\nk=11, turn 79, y=9, not freeway, safe\n\nAll safe.\n\nAnd we reached at k=11.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need the sequence of actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 79, we have action S, but since position is 9, it could be any, but we specify.\n\nTo write.\n\nIn the car list, for freeway 4, there is a car at k=12-14, but we not on it.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nSo minimal H=12.\n\nBut is there a way with H=11? We thought not, but let's see if we can be on y=4 at k=2 or something, impossible.\n\nOr at k=6, but then to y=9 at k=11, but from k=6 to k=11, 5 steps, y from 4 to 9, min 5 up moves, so possible: y6=4, y7=5, y8=6, y9=7, y10=8, y11=9.\n\nBut need to be at y=4 at k=6.\n\nFrom start: y0=0 to y6=4 in 6 steps.\n\nWith 6 actions, from y=0 to y=4, min 4 U, so 2 extra actions, which can be stay or down, but down not helpful.\n\nSo 4 U and 2 S, or 5 U and 1 D, but D would require more U later, worse.\n\nSo 4 U and 2 S.\n\nBut at k=4, must be y<=3.\n\nNow, y0=0\n\nAfter actions to y6=4.\n\nFor example: suppose we have actions with stays.\n\nBut to be at y=4 at k=6.\n\nk=0 y=0\n\nIf we go U,U,U, to y=3 at k=3.\n\nThen at k=3, y=3, if U, to y=4 at k=4, but k=4 y=4 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf we stay at beginning: k=0 y=0 S to k=1 y=0\n\nk=1 y=0 U to k=2 y=1\n\nk=2 y=1 U to k=3 y=2\n\nk=3 y=2 U to k=4 y=3\n\nk=4 y=3, now if U to y=4 at k=5, unsafe at k=5 for y=4.\n\nIf S to y=3 at k=5\n\nThen U to y=4 at k=6.\n\nBut then y6=4, then y7=5, ..., y11=9, so at k=11 y=9, H=12 same as before.\n\nIf at k=4 y=3, we go U to y=4 at k=5, collision, not possible.\n\nSo no way to be at y=4 before k=6 safely.\n\nThus H=12 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 68\\) is 12, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is determined as follows:\n- Start at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 68 (\\(k = 0\\)).\n- Move up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 69 (\\(k = 1\\)), \\(y = 2\\) at turn 70 (\\(k = 2\\)), and \\(y = 3\\) at turn 71 (\\(k = 3\\)). All are safe since freeways 1, 2, and 3 are only unsafe at \\(k = 16\\) to \\(19\\).\n- Stay at \\(y = 3\\) for turns 72 (\\(k = 4\\)) and 73 (\\(k = 5\\)) to avoid the unsafe period for freeway 4 at \\(k = 4\\) and \\(k = 5\\) (and also \\(k = 3\\), but \\(k = 3\\) is passed safely). Freeway 3 is safe at \\(k = 4\\) and \\(k = 5\\) since it is only unsafe at \\(k = 16\\) to \\(19\\).\n- Move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 74 (\\(k = 6\\)). Freeway 4 is safe at \\(k = 6\\) (unsafe only at \\(k = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\\)).\n- Move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 75 (\\(k = 7\\)), \\(y = 6\\) at turn 76 (\\(k = 8\\)), \\(y = 7\\) at turn 77 (\\(k = 9\\)), and \\(y = 8\\) at turn 78 (\\(k = 10\\)). Freeways 5, 6, 7, and 8 are only unsafe at \\(k = 4\\), so all are safe at these times.\n- Move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 79 (\\(k = 11\\)). Since \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway, it is safe. At turn 79, the position is \\((0, 9)\\), so the action can be \"S\" (stay) to remain at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe actions for each turn are:\n- Turn 68: U (move up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 69)\n- Turn 69: U (move up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 70)\n- Turn 70: U (move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 71)\n- Turn 71: S (stay at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 72)\n- Turn 72: S (stay at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 73)\n- Turn 73: U (move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 74)\n- Turn 74: U (move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 75)\n- Turn 75: U (move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 76)\n- Turn 76: U (move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 77)\n- Turn 77: U (move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 78)\n- Turn 78: U (move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 79)\n- Turn 79: S (stay at \\(y = 9\\), as the goal is reached)\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions:\n- At \\(k = 4\\) (turn 72), \\(y = 3\\) is safe (freeway 3 unsafe only at \\(k = 16-19\\)).\n- At \\(k = 5\\) (turn 73), \\(y = 3\\) is safe.\n- At \\(k = 6\\) (turn 74), \\(y = 4\\) is safe (freeway 4 unsafe only at \\(k = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\\)).\n- Other positions and times are safe as per car states.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 68: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 69: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 70: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 71: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 72: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 73: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 74: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 75: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 76: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 77: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 78: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 79: \\text{ S} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 71, and the player is at (0,3). We need to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8).\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position y is updated as:\n  - U: y = y + 1\n  - D: y = y - 1\n  - S: y remains the same\n\nBut note: y must be in [0,9]. So we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if the player is at (0, y_T) and y_T is between 1 and 8 (inclusive), then we check the cars on freeway y_T. Collision occurs if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on freeway y_T at turn T and on freeway y_{T+1} at turn T+1. Therefore, at the moment of moving (turn T), we are still on the starting freeway.\n\nWe are given the state of cars at turn 71 (current turn). For future turns, we compute the car positions as:\n\nFor a car at turn t1 (71) with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s:\n  - If left-moving (d='left'), then at turn T (>=71): \n        head(T) = h - s*(T-71)\n        tail(T) = tau - s*(T-71)\n  - If right-moving (d='right'), then at turn T (>=71):\n        head(T) = h + s*(T-71)\n        tail(T) = tau + s*(T-71)\n\nBut note: the span is given as [head, tail] for left-moving? Actually, the problem states for left-moving: \n    Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\nFor right-moving: \n    Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me reinterpret:\n\nIn the table, for a car we are given (head, tail, direction, speed). The representation of the span:\n\n- For a left-moving car: the head is at a higher x than the tail? Actually, the problem says:\n    Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] \n  and then moves to [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\n  But note that in the table, for freeway 1: (-39, -50, right, 3). \n  For a right-moving car, the representation is: head and tail? The problem says for right-moving: \n        Span(t1) = [tau, h] \n  and becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo in the given data, for a right-moving car, the head is at h and the tail is at tau, and the span is from tau to h (which implies tau < h because the car is moving right, so the tail is at a lower x than the head). Similarly, for a left-moving car, the head is at h and tail at tau, and the span is from h to tau (so h > tau?).\n\nBut in the data we have for freeway 1: (-39, -50, right, 3). \n  Since it's right-moving, the span at t1=71 is [tau, h] = [-50, -39]. Then at a future turn T, the span becomes [-50 + 3*(T-71), -39 + 3*(T-71)].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 4: \n  (-36, -47, right, 4) -> span at t1: [-47, -36]\n  (0, -11, right, 4) -> span at t1: [-11, 0]\n  (36, 25, right, 4) -> wait, 25 and 36: but 25 < 36, so if it's right-moving, the span should be [25, 36]? But the problem says the representation is (head, tail) and for right-moving the span is [tail, head]. So the given (head, tail) for right-moving must be such that tail <= head? \n\nLooking at freeway 4: \n  First car: head=-36, tail=-47 -> so tail=-47 < head=-36 -> then the span is [tail, head] = [-47, -36]. \n  Second car: head=0, tail=-11 -> span [-11,0]\n  Third car: head=36, tail=25 -> but 25<36 -> span [25,36]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5: (-12,-23,right,12) -> tail=-23, head=-12 -> span [-23,-12]; and (36,25,right,12) -> tail=25, head=36 -> span [25,36].\n\nNow, collision condition: at turn T, if the player is at freeway k (where k in {1,...,8}) and at that turn, 0 is in the span of any car on freeway k.\n\nWe are at turn 71 at position (0,3). We are on freeway 3? But note: the freeways are from y=1 to y=8. The player is at y=3 at turn 71, so we must check freeway 3 at turn 71.\n\nFreeway 3 has one car: (-39, -50, right, 3). \n  Span at turn 71: [tau, head] = [-50, -39]. \n  Is 0 in [-50, -39]? No. So at turn 71, we are safe.\n\nOur goal: get to y=9. Note that y=9 is the top, and there are no freeways above 8. So when we are at y=9, we are safe (no cars). We start at y=3.\n\nWe need to move up. But we have to avoid the cars on the freeways 4,5,6,7,8 when we are on those freeways at the corresponding turns.\n\nPlan: we are going to simulate the movement from turn 71 (y=3) and try to reach y=9 in the minimal number of turns. We can use BFS (state: (turn, y)) but note that the turn number can be large? However, we are only concerned until we reach y=9, and the minimal steps is at least 6 (because 3 to 9 is 6 steps up) and at most ... we might have to wait sometimes.\n\nBut note: we can also move down? However, since we are starting at 3 and need to go to 9, and going down would be counterproductive, we should avoid down unless necessary? Actually, we cannot go below 0, and we are at 3, so down to 2,1,0 is possible. But then we have to come back. So that might take more steps. Therefore, we should try to go up as much as possible, but we might have to wait (stay) or even go down to avoid a collision and then go up.\n\nHowever, the minimal H is at least 6 (if we go up every turn). Let's see if we can go up 6 times in a row without colliding.\n\nWe start at turn 71: y=3 -> safe (as we saw).\n\nThen we plan the next turns:\n\nTurn 71: we are at y=3. We choose an action for turn 71 that will take effect at the next state: so at turn 72, we will be at a new y.\n\nBut note: the problem asks for actions starting at turn t1 (which is 71). The sequence of actions for t = t1, t1+1, ... until the turn before we reach 9? Actually, we need to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So we start at turn 71 (index t=0 in the sequence of actions) and we have H actions? Actually, the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, meaning we have H actions and we end at turn 71+H.\n\nBut note: at turn 71 we are at (0,3). Then we take an action at turn 71, which moves us to turn 72 at a new y. Then we take an action at turn 72, etc.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at some turn T. The minimal H is the number of actions (turns from 71 to T-1) such that after H actions, we are at y=9. So T = 71 + H.\n\nWe need to simulate:\n\nWe are at turn 71: y=3 (safe).\n\nWe choose an action at turn 71: U, D, or S.\n\nIf we choose U at turn 71, then at turn 72 we will be at y=4.\n\nBut at turn 72, we are at freeway 4. We must check freeway 4 at turn 72 for collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose S, we stay at y=3 at turn 72? Actually, no: if we choose S at turn 71, then at turn 72 we are still at y=3? Actually, the update is: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nSo at turn 71, we are at y_71=3. Then we choose a_71, which gives Delta y_71, so y_72 = y_71 + Delta y_71.\n\nTherefore, if we choose S at turn 71, then y_72=3.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose U, then y_72=4, and if D, then y_72=2.\n\nWe must avoid collisions at every turn from 71 until we reach 9? Actually, when we are at turn T and we are at a freeway k (1<=k<=8) we must check. When we are at y=0 or y=9, there are no freeways, so no collision.\n\nSo we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nWe start at turn 71 at y=3 (safe). We need to end at y=9 (safe).\n\nWe are going to simulate the next turns and check the car positions.\n\nFirst, we need a function to check for a given freeway k and turn T, whether there is a car such that 0 is in its span.\n\nLet's define the cars for each freeway at turn 71:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=-39, tail=-50, d='right', s=3) -> span at T: [ -50 + 3*(T-71), -39 + 3*(T-71) ]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? Actually, the table says the same: (-39,-50,right,3) -> same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: same: (-39,-50,right,3)\n\nFreeway 4: three cars:\n  car1: (head=-36, tail=-47, d='right', s=4) -> span: [ -47 + 4*(T-71), -36 + 4*(T-71) ]\n  car2: (head=0, tail=-11, d='right', s=4) -> span: [ -11 + 4*(T-71), 0 + 4*(T-71) ]\n  car3: (head=36, tail=25, d='right', s=4) -> span: [ 25 + 4*(T-71), 36 + 4*(T-71) ]\n\nFreeway 5: two cars:\n  car1: (head=-12, tail=-23, d='right', s=12) -> span: [ -23 + 12*(T-71), -12 + 12*(T-71) ]\n  car2: (head=36, tail=25, d='right', s=12) -> span: [25 + 12*(T-71), 36 + 12*(T-71)]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5? \n  The table says: (-12,-23,right,12) and (36,25,right,12) -> same as freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 5.\n\nNow, we want to go from y=3 to y=9 in minimal steps. The minimal steps without any obstacles is 6 (all U). Let's check if that is safe.\n\nWe start at turn 71: y=3 (safe).\n\nTurn 71: choose U -> at turn 72: y=4.\n\nAt turn 72, we are at freeway 4. Check freeway 4 at turn 72 (T=72):\n\n  car1: [ -47 + 4*(72-71) = -47+4 = -43, -36+4 = -32] -> 0 not in [-43,-32]\n  car2: [ -11+4= -7, 0+4=4] -> 0 in [-7,4]? Yes, because -7<=0<=4 -> collision!\n\nSo we cannot do U at turn 71 because at turn 72 we would be at y=4 and collide.\n\nAlternative: we could choose S at turn 71 -> then at turn 72 we are still at y=3.\n\nAt turn 72: y=3 -> freeway 3. Check freeway 3 at turn 72 (T=72):\n\n  car: [ -50 + 3*(72-71) = -50+3 = -47, -39+3 = -36] -> 0 not in [-47,-36] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn 72, we can choose U -> then at turn 73: y=4.\n\nCheck freeway 4 at turn 73 (T=73):\n\n  car1: [ -47+4*(73-71)= -47+8 = -39, -36+8=-28] -> 0 not in [-39,-28]\n  car2: [ -11+8 = -3, 0+8=8] -> 0 in [-3,8] -> collision.\n\nSo again, if we go to y=4 at turn 73, we collide.\n\nWe need to avoid being at freeway 4 when car2 has 0 in its span. Let's see when car2 on freeway 4 has 0 in its span:\n\n  car2: [ -11 + 4*(T-71), 0 + 4*(T-71) ]\n\nWe require: -11 + 4*(T-71) <= 0 <= 0 + 4*(T-71)\nBut note: the second endpoint is 4*(T-71). So the condition becomes:\n\n  -11 + 4*(T-71) <= 0 <= 4*(T-71)\n\nThe right inequality: 0 <= 4*(T-71) -> T>=71, which is always true.\n\nThe left: -11 + 4*(T-71) <= 0 -> 4*(T-71) <= 11 -> T-71 <= 11/4 = 2.75 -> T<=73.75 -> so for T=72,73,74? Let's check:\n\nT=72: -11+4= -7 <=0 -> true -> collision at T=72 and T=73? \nT=73: -11+8 = -3 <=0 -> true -> collision at T=73.\nT=74: -11+12=1 >0 -> false -> no collision at T=74.\n\nSo at T=74, car2: [ -11+12=1, 0+12=12] -> 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, car1 at T=74: [-47+4*3=-35, -36+12=-24] -> 0 not in.\ncar3: [25+12=37, 36+12=48] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 4 is safe at T>=74? Actually at T=74,75,... until when? car2: after T=74, the car2 moves to [1,12] and beyond, so 0 is not included.\n\nTherefore, if we are at freeway 4 at turn 74 or later, we are safe.\n\nSimilarly, we have to check the other freeways.\n\nBut we are currently at turn 71 at y=3. We need to get to y=4 at a turn >=74.\n\nHow? We can wait at y=3 for a few turns. Then go up.\n\nBut note: we also have to go through freeways 5,6,7,8. And each of these has cars.\n\nLet me check freeway 5 at different turns:\n\nFreeway 5 has two cars:\n  car1: (head=-12, tail=-23, right,12) -> span: [ -23 + 12*(T-71), -12 + 12*(T-71) ]\n  car2: (head=36, tail=25, right,12) -> span: [25+12*(T-71), 36+12*(T-71)]\n\nWe are concerned when 0 is in the span of either car.\n\nFor car1: \n  -23 + 12*(T-71) <= 0 <= -12 + 12*(T-71)\n\nThe right inequality: 0 <= -12 + 12*(T-71) -> 12*(T-71) >=12 -> T-71>=1 -> T>=72.\n\nThe left: -23 + 12*(T-71) <=0 -> 12*(T-71) <=23 -> T-71<=23/12≈1.916 -> T<=72.916.\n\nSo only at T=72: \n  car1: [ -23+12= -11, -12+12=0] -> 0 is included? [ -11,0] -> yes, 0 is the endpoint -> included? The problem says \"if 0 in Span(T)\". Since it's a closed interval, 0 is included. So collision at T=72 for car1.\n\nAt T=72: car1: [ -23+12*(1)= -11, -12+12=0] -> 0 is in [ -11,0] -> collision.\n\nAt T=73: [ -23+24=1, -12+24=12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, car2: [25+12*(T-71), 36+12*(T-71)] -> 0 is never in because the smallest value is at T=71: 25 to 36 (both positive) and increasing.\n\nSo freeway 5 is dangerous only at T=72.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6,7,8 have the same cars? The table says they are the same as freeway 5. So:\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5 -> dangerous at T=72 only.\nFreeway 7: dangerous at T=72 only.\nFreeway 8: dangerous at T=72 only.\n\nBut wait, what about other turns? For car1 on freeway 5: we saw only T=72 is dangerous? \n\nBut note: the car moves at speed 12, so after T=72, the car1 moves to x=1 at T=73 and beyond. But what about T=71? \n  At T=71: [ -23, -12] -> 0 is not in because -23<=0<=-12? No, because 0 is not <= -12 -> 0 is not in [-23,-12]? Actually, -23<=0 is true, but 0<=-12 is false. So the condition for a closed interval [a,b] is a<=x<=b. For car1 at T=71: a=-23, b=-12, and 0 is not <= -12 -> so no.\n\nSo only T=72 is dangerous for freeways 5,6,7,8.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeways 5,6,7,8 at turn 72.\n\nNow, let's summarize the dangerous turns per freeway:\n\nFreeway 4: dangerous at T=72 and T=73 (because of car2) -> safe from T=74 onward.\nFreeway 5: dangerous at T=72 -> safe at T=71,73,74,...\nFreeway 6: same as 5 -> dangerous only at T=72.\nFreeway 7: same -> dangerous only at T=72.\nFreeway 8: same -> dangerous only at T=72.\n\nFreeways 1,2,3: \n  We have cars: [ -50+3*(T-71), -39+3*(T-71) ]\n\nCheck when 0 is in that interval:\n\n  -50+3*(T-71) <= 0 <= -39+3*(T-71)\n\nLeft: -50+3*(T-71)<=0 -> 3*(T-71)<=50 -> T-71<=50/3≈16.66 -> T<=87.66 -> always true for our small H? \nBut right: 0<=-39+3*(T-71) -> 3*(T-71)>=39 -> T-71>=13 -> T>=84.\n\nSo for T>=84, the right condition holds. Then we need to check the left: \n  at T=84: -50+3*(13)= -50+39 = -11 <=0 -> true -> so 0 in [-11,0]? The interval: \n      left = -50+3*(84-71)= -50+39=-11\n      right = -39+39=0\n  so [ -11,0] -> 0 is included -> collision.\n\nAt T=85: [-50+42=-8, -39+42=3] -> 0 in [-8,3] -> collision.\n\nWe can solve: \n  0 is in [ -50+3*(T-71), -39+3*(T-71) ] \n  when both:\n      -50+3*(T-71) <= 0  -> T-71 <= 50/3 -> T<=71+16.666 -> T<=87.666 -> T<=87\n      and \n      -39+3*(T-71) >=0 -> T-71>=13 -> T>=84\n\nSo dangerous for T in [84,87].\n\nBut our minimal H is around 6 to 10? Probably we won't take 13 turns to get to freeway 1,2,3? We are starting at y=3 and going up to 9. We don't need to go to freeway 1,2,3 again. So we can ignore? Actually, we are going up from 3 to 4 to 5... to 9. We will not be on freeway 1,2,3 again? \n\nBut what if we go down? Then we might be on freeway 2 or 1. However, we are trying to minimize steps and going down would increase steps, so we avoid. So we can assume we are only going to freeways 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nSo freeways 1,2,3 are not in our path? Actually, we are starting at y=3 (freeway 3) and then moving to 4,5,... so we leave freeway 3 and above. We won't go below 3. So we don't need to worry about freeways 1 and 2? And freeway 3 only at the start.\n\nWe are at freeway 3 at turn 71 (safe) and we can leave at turn 72. Then we won't be back. So the dangerous turns for freeway 3 at T>=84 are irrelevant because we are not there.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: we have to pass through, but we know it's dangerous at T=72,73 and safe from T=74.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8: dangerous only at T=72.\n\nSo the plan:\n\nWe must avoid being at:\n  freeway 4 at turns 72 and 73 -> safe at turn 74 and after.\n  freeway 5 at turn 72 -> safe at other turns.\n  similarly for 6,7,8 at turn 72.\n\nSo if we can arrange to be at freeway 4 at a turn >=74, and avoid being at freeways 5,6,7,8 at turn 72, then we are safe.\n\nHow to get from y=3 to y=9? We need to go up 6 steps.\n\nWe are at turn 71: y=3.\n\nWe can wait at y=3 for a few turns? Then go up.\n\nBut we cannot be at freeway 4 at T=72 or 73. So we must not be at y=4 at turn 72 or 73.\n\nTherefore, we can be at y=4 at turn 74 or later.\n\nSimilarly, we can be at freeway 5 (y=5) at any turn except 72.\n\nBut note: if we are at y=5 at turn 72, then we are on freeway 5 at turn 72 -> collision.\n\nSo we must avoid being at y=5 at turn 72? Actually, we are at y=5 at turn 72 only if we moved up twice in a row? \n\nBut we start at y=3 at turn 71.\n\nIf we do:\n  turn71: U -> then turn72: y=4 -> then if we do U at turn72: then turn73: y=5 -> but at turn72 we are at y=4 (which is dangerous) and then at turn73 we are at y=5. \n\nBut we also must avoid being at freeway 5 at turn72: but at turn72 we are at y=4, not y=5. So that's safe for freeway5? \n\nBut at turn73: we are at y=5 -> freeway5. Then check turn73: \n  freeway5: at T=73, we saw car1: [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSo if we can get to y=4 at a safe time (>=74) then we can proceed.\n\nBut we cannot get to y=4 at turn72 or 73. So the earliest we can be at y=4 is turn74.\n\nHow to get to y=4 at turn74?\n\nWe are at y=3 at turn71. We can stay at y=3 for 3 turns? Then at turn74, we move up to y=4.\n\nSo:\n  turn71: S -> at turn72: y=3\n  turn72: S -> at turn73: y=3\n  turn73: S -> at turn74: y=3\n  then turn74: U -> at turn75: y=4\n\nBut that is 4 actions and we are at y=4 at turn75? Actually, we are at y=4 at turn75? Let me count:\n\n  t71: start at 3, do S -> t72: 3\n  t72: do S -> t73: 3\n  t73: do S -> t74: 3\n  t74: do U -> t75: 4\n\nSo at turn74, we are still at 3? Then at turn74 we do U and then at turn75 we are at 4.\n\nBut we want to be at freeway4 at turn74? Then we must be at y=4 at turn74. How?\n\nTo be at y=4 at turn74, we must have been at y=3 at turn73 and then do U at turn73: \n  turn73: U -> then at turn74: y=4.\n\nBut we cannot be at y=4 at turn74? Actually, we can: because at turn74, freeway4 is safe (as we saw: T=74 is safe).\n\nBut how do we get to turn73 at y=3? \n\nWe start at turn71: y=3.\n  turn71: S -> turn72: y=3\n  turn72: S -> turn73: y=3\n  then turn73: U -> turn74: y=4.\n\nSo we are at y=4 at turn74 -> safe for freeway4.\n\nThen we can proceed.\n\nNow, from y=4 at turn74, we can go up to y=5 at turn75: \n  turn74: we are at y=4, then we do U -> turn75: y=5.\n\nAt turn75, we are at freeway5. Check freeway5 at T=75:\n  car1: [ -23+12*(75-71)= -23+12*4= -23+48=25, -12+48=36] -> 0 not in [25,36] -> safe.\n  car2: [25+48=73, 36+48=84] -> safe.\n\nThen we can go to y=6 at turn76: \n  turn75: U -> turn76: y=6.\n\nAt turn76: freeway6 at T=76:\n  same as freeway5? The cars on freeway6 are the same as freeway5: \n      car1: [-23+12*(76-71)= -23+12*5= -23+60=37, -12+60=48] -> safe.\n      car2: [25+60=85, 36+60=96] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can go to y=7 at turn77: \n  turn76: U -> turn77: y=7.\n\nAt turn77: freeway7 at T=77: \n  car1: [-23+12*6= -23+72=49, -12+72=60] -> safe.\n  car2: [25+72=97, 36+72=108] -> safe.\n\nThen y=8 at turn78: \n  turn77: U -> turn78: y=8.\n\nAt turn78: freeway8 at T=78: \n  car1: [-23+12*7= -23+84=61, -12+84=72] -> safe.\n  car2: [25+84=109, 36+84=120] -> safe.\n\nThen we can go to y=9 at turn79: \n  turn78: U -> turn79: y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo the entire sequence:\n\nTurn71: S\nTurn72: S\nTurn73: U\nTurn74: U\nTurn75: U\nTurn76: U\nTurn77: U\nTurn78: U\n\nBut wait, we are at y=9 at turn79. How many actions? From turn71 to turn78: that's 8 actions? \n  Actions: t71, t72, t73, t74, t75, t76, t77, t78 -> 8 actions.\n\nBut we started at y=3 at turn71. After 8 actions, we are at turn79: y=9.\n\nIs there a faster way?\n\nWe need to get to y=9 in minimal H. Without obstacles, 6 actions (all U) would get us to y=9 at turn77: \n  t71: U -> t72:4\n  t72: U -> t73:5\n  t73: U -> t74:6\n  t74: U -> t75:7\n  t75: U -> t76:8\n  t76: U -> t77:9\n\nBut we know that at t72: if we go to 4, we collide (freeway4 at t72 is dangerous). Also, if we avoid freeway4 at t72 and t73, then we can start going up at t73 to be at 4 at t74.\n\nBut then we can do:\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nWe wait at y=3 for 2 turns (so t71:S, t72:S) then at t73:U -> t74:4 (safe at freeway4 because t74>=74). Then we can go up every turn: \n  t74:U -> t75:5\n  t75:U -> t76:6\n  t76:U -> t77:7\n  t77:U -> t78:8\n  t78:U -> t79:9\n\nBut that's 7 actions? \n  Actions: t71:S, t72:S, t73:U, t74:U, t75:U, t76:U, t77:U, t78:U -> 8 actions? \n\nWait, no: \n  t71: S -> then at t72: y=3\n  t72: S -> then at t73: y=3\n  t73: U -> then at t74: y=4\n  t74: U -> then at t75: y=5\n  t75: U -> then at t76: y=6\n  t76: U -> then at t77: y=7\n  t77: U -> then at t78: y=8\n  t78: U -> then at t79: y=9\n\nSo 8 actions? But we only need 6 steps up? The two waits at the beginning.\n\nBut note: we can start going up earlier? We cannot go to y=4 at t72 or t73. So we have to wait until t73 to do the first U? Then we get to 4 at t74.\n\nBut what if we do:\n\n  t71: D -> then at t72: y=2 -> but then we are at freeway2? And freeway2 is safe at t72? \n      Freeway2: same as freeway1: car: [ -50+3*(72-71)= -47, -36] -> safe.\n  Then at t72: U -> then at t73: y=3 -> freeway3? \n      Freeway3: [ -50+3*(73-71)= -50+6=-44, -39+6=-33] -> safe.\n  Then at t73: U -> then at t74: y=4 -> freeway4 at t74: safe.\n  Then we go up: t74:U->5, t75:U->6, t76:U->7, t77:U->8, t78:U->9.\n\nThis is also 8 actions? \n  Actions: t71:D, t72:U, t73:U, t74:U, t75:U, t76:U, t77:U, t78:U -> 8 actions.\n\nBut we went down and then up, so we wasted one step? Actually, we did one extra step (down and then up) so it's the same as waiting? \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  t71: S -> then t72: y=3 (safe)\n  t72: S -> then t73: y=3 (safe)\n  t73: U -> then t74: y=4 (safe)\n  then we do 5 U: t74:U->5, t75:U->6, t76:U->7, t77:U->8, t78:U->9 -> total 8 actions.\n\nBut is there a way to get to 9 in 7 actions? \n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn78? That is, we start at turn71: y=3, and after 7 actions (t71 to t77) we are at turn78: and we want y=9.\n\nWe need to go up 6 times and one other move? But 6 ups would get us to 9, but we have to avoid the obstacles.\n\nWe cannot be at y=4 at turn72 or 73. So the earliest we can be at y=4 is turn74.\n\nThen the earliest we can be at y=5 is turn75, y=6 at turn76, y=7 at turn77, y=8 at turn78, y=9 at turn79.\n\nSo we cannot get to y=9 before turn79? Then the minimal H is 8? Because we start at turn71 and we do 8 actions (t71 to t78) to get to y=9 at turn79.\n\nBut let me confirm: \n  After 1 action (t71): we are at turn72 -> we can be at y=2,3,4.\n  After 2 actions (t72): turn73 -> y=1,2,3,4,5? Not exactly: we can only move one step at a time.\n\nThe minimal time to go from 3 to 9 is 6 steps, and we have to start the first step at turn71 and the last step at turn78 (so we end at turn79). \n\nBut we have to avoid being at y=4 at turn72 and turn73. So we cannot do:\n\n  t71: U -> t72:4 (collision) -> not allowed.\n\nSo we must not do U at t71. Similarly, we cannot do two U's at t71 and t72 because that would put us at 5 at turn73? But we are at 4 at turn72 (collision) and then at 5 at turn73? But the collision at turn72 already happens.\n\nSo we must not be at 4 at turn72 or 73.\n\nTherefore, we can only be at 4 at turn74 or later.\n\nThen the earliest we can be at 5 is turn75, 6 at76, 7 at77, 8 at78, 9 at79.\n\nSo the minimal H is 8.\n\nBut wait, what if we go faster? For example, we skip freeway5,6,7,8 quickly? But we can only move one step per turn.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to be at freeway5 at a turn that is not 72? But we already know that freeway5 is safe at any turn except 72. So we can be at freeway5 at turn73,74,... without problem.\n\nBut we have to go through freeway4 at a safe time (>=74) and then freeway5 at a time not 72 -> which is easy since we are going to be at freeway5 at turn75 (if we go up at turn74 and then turn75) and that is safe.\n\nSo the sequence I described is safe and minimal.\n\nBut let me check if we can do 7 actions? \n\nSuppose we do:\n\n  t71: S -> t72: y=3\n  t72: S -> t73: y=3\n  t73: U -> t74: y=4\n  t74: U -> t75: y=5\n  t75: U -> t76: y=6\n  t76: U -> t77: y=7\n  t77: U -> t78: y=8 -> then we are at turn78 at y=8. We need to be at y=9 at the end of the sequence? \n\nBut the sequence has 7 actions: t71 to t77. Then at turn78, we are at y=8, not 9. So we haven't reached 9.\n\nTo reach 9, we need one more U at t78: then we get to y=9 at turn79. So that's 8 actions.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 8.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn71: S\nTurn72: S\nTurn73: U\nTurn74: U\nTurn75: U\nTurn76: U\nTurn77: U\nTurn78: U\n\nBut we have 8 actions. The problem says the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so H=8.\n\nBut let me verify the positions:\n\n  t71: start at (0,3)\n  t71: action S -> so at t72: (0,3)\n  t72: action S -> at t73: (0,3)\n  t73: action U -> at t74: (0,4)\n  t74: action U -> at t75: (0,5)\n  t75: action U -> at t76: (0,6)\n  t76: action U -> at t77: (0,7)\n  t77: action U -> at t78: (0,8)\n  t78: action U -> at t79: (0,9) -> reached.\n\nNow check collisions:\n\nAt t72: y=3 -> freeway3: T=72: [ -50+3*(1)= -47, -39+3=-36] -> 0 not in -> safe.\nAt t73: y=3 -> freeway3: T=73: [ -50+6=-44, -39+6=-33] -> safe.\nAt t74: y=4 -> freeway4: T=74: \n  car1: [-47+4*3 = -47+12=-35, -36+12=-24] -> safe.\n  car2: [-11+12=1, 0+12=12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n  car3: [25+12=37,36+12=48] -> safe.\nAt t75: y=5 -> freeway5: T=75: \n  car1: [-23+12*4= -23+48=25, -12+48=36] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  car2: [25+48=73,36+48=84] -> safe.\nAt t76: y=6 -> freeway6: T=76: same as freeway5 at T=76? \n      car1: [-23+12*5= -23+60=37, -12+60=48] -> safe.\n      car2: [25+60=85,36+60=96] -> safe.\nAt t77: y=7 -> freeway7: T=77: \n      car1: [-23+72=49, -12+72=60] -> safe.\n      car2: [25+72=97,36+72=108] -> safe.\nAt t78: y=8 -> freeway8: T=78: \n      car1: [-23+84=61, -12+84=72] -> safe.\n      car2: [25+84=109,36+84=120] -> safe.\n\nAnd then at t79: we are at y=9 -> no freeway -> safe.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut note: we are at y=3 at turns 71,72,73. At turn73 we are at y=3 and then we move to y=4 at turn74. \n\nIs there a sequence with 7 actions? \n\nSuppose we try to do 7 actions and end at turn78 at y=9? That means we have to be at y=9 at turn78.\n\nWe start at y=3 at turn71. We need to go up 6 times. We have 7 actions: so we can do 6 U and 1 S? But that would not get us to 9: because 3 + 6*1 = 9, but if we do one S, we are only at 3+5=8? So we must do 6 U and one extra move? But that would overshoot? We cannot go above 9.\n\nSo we must do exactly 6 U and one wait? But then we would be at 3 + 6 = 9? How? \n\nWe do 6 U and one S: but the S can be anywhere. Then the net movement is 5 up? So we end at 3+5=8? Not 9.\n\nTherefore, we must have at least 6 U moves. And we cannot avoid the two waits at the beginning? \n\nBut we could do:\n\n  t71: U -> but that would put us at y=4 at t72 -> collision -> not allowed.\n\n  t71: S\n  t72: U -> then at t73: y=4? But wait: \n        t71: S -> t72: y=3\n        t72: U -> then at t73: y=4 -> but T=73: freeway4 is dangerous -> collision.\n\n  t71: D -> then t72: y=2\n        at t72: freeway2: safe.\n        then t72: U -> t73: y=3\n        then t73: U -> t74: y=4 (safe) -> then we do 4 more U: t74:U->5, t75:U->6, t76:U->7, t77:U->8, t78:U->9 -> so we are at 9 at t79? \n        But we did: t71:D, t72:U, t73:U, t74:U, t75:U, t76:U, t77:U, t78:U -> 8 actions.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  t71: S\n  t72: U -> then at t73: y=4 -> collision? Because freeway4 at t73: car2: [-11+4*(73-71)= -11+8=-3, 0+8=8] -> 0 in [-3,8] -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot do that.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is the 8-action one.\n\nBut wait, what if we do:\n\n  t71: S\n  t72: S\n  t73: U -> t74:4\n  t74: U -> t75:5\n  t75: U -> t76:6\n  t76: U -> t77:7\n  t77: U -> t78:8\n  then we are at 8 at t78. We need to go to 9 at the next turn? But we have done 7 actions so far? Then we do the 8th action at t78: U -> t79:9.\n\nSo we cannot avoid 8 actions.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and H is the number of actions. So H=8.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 71: S\nTurn 72: S\nTurn 73: U\nTurn 74: U\nTurn 75: U\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: U\nTurn 78: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the sequence should start at t_1 (which is 71) and go for H-1? \n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nSo the first action is at t_1 (71), then next at t_1+1 (72), ... until t_1+H-1.\n\nWe have 8 actions: from 71 to 78.\n\nSo the last action is at 78, and then at turn 79 we are at 9.\n\nSo it matches.\n\nBut the answer format:\n\nTurn 71: a_{71} = S\nTurn 72: a_{72} = S\nTurn 73: a_{73} = U\nTurn 74: a_{74} = U\nTurn 75: a_{75} = U\nTurn 76: a_{76} = U\nTurn 77: a_{77} = U\nTurn 78: a_{78} = U\n\nWe write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 71: S\nTurn 72: S\nTurn 73: U\nTurn 74: U\nTurn 75: U\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: U\nTurn 78: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"avoiding collisions\", and we have checked.\n\nOne more thing: at turn78, we are at y=8 (freeway8) at T=78: safe as computed.\n\nSo this should be the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn 71 in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8, the following sequence of actions is determined to be optimal. The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 8, meaning the sequence spans from turn 71 to turn 78, and the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 79.\n\n### Key Considerations for Collision Avoidance:\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)** is dangerous at turns 72 and 73 due to car spans containing 0. It becomes safe from turn 74 onward.\n- **Freeways 5, 6, 7, and 8 (y=5 to y=8)** are dangerous only at turn 72 due to car spans containing 0. They are safe at all other turns.\n- The player starts at y=3 (freeway 3) at turn 71, which is safe at the initial state and remains safe for the relevant turns as long as the player avoids being on dangerous freeways at the specified turns.\n\n### Optimal Action Sequence:\nThe sequence minimizes \\(H\\) by waiting at y=3 for two turns (to avoid the dangerous turns on freeway 4) and then moving up consecutively. This ensures:\n- The player is not on freeway 4 at turns 72 or 73.\n- The player is not on freeways 5–8 at turn 72.\n- The player reaches y=9 at turn 79 after 8 actions.\n\nThe actions are as follows:\n\n- **Turn 71**: Stay (S) – Player remains at y=3 (safe, as freeway 3 is safe at turn 71).\n- **Turn 72**: Stay (S) – Player remains at y=3 (safe, as freeway 3 is safe at turn 72).\n- **Turn 73**: Up (U) – Player moves to y=4 at turn 74 (safe, as freeway 4 is safe at turn 74).\n- **Turn 74**: Up (U) – Player moves to y=5 at turn 75 (safe, as freeway 5 is safe at turn 75).\n- **Turn 75**: Up (U) – Player moves to y=6 at turn 76 (safe, as freeway 6 is safe at turn 76).\n- **Turn 76**: Up (U) – Player moves to y=7 at turn 77 (safe, as freeway 7 is safe at turn 77).\n- **Turn 77**: Up (U) – Player moves to y=8 at turn 78 (safe, as freeway 8 is safe at turn 78).\n- **Turn 78**: Up (U) – Player moves to y=9 at turn 79 (safe, as y=9 has no freeway).\n\n### Verification of Path:\n- **Turn 71**: Position (0, 3) – Safe (freeway 3: span [-50, -39] does not contain 0).\n- **Turn 72**: Position (0, 3) – Safe (freeway 3: span [-47, -36] does not contain 0).\n- **Turn 73**: Position (0, 3) – Safe (freeway 3: span [-44, -33] does not contain 0).\n- **Turn 74**: Position (0, 4) – Safe (freeway 4: car spans [-35, -24], [1, 12], [37, 48] do not contain 0).\n- **Turn 75**: Position (0, 5) – Safe (freeway 5: car spans [25, 36], [73, 84] do not contain 0).\n- **Turn 76**: Position (0, 6) – Safe (freeway 6: car spans [37, 48], [85, 96] do not contain 0).\n- **Turn 77**: Position (0, 7) – Safe (freeway 7: car spans [49, 60], [97, 108] do not contain 0).\n- **Turn 78**: Position (0, 8) – Safe (freeway 8: car spans [61, 72], [109, 120] do not contain 0).\n- **Turn 79**: Position (0, 9) – Safe (no freeway).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in 8 turns, which is minimal given the collision constraints.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 71: S\nTurn 72: S\nTurn 73: U\nTurn 74: U\nTurn 75: U\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: U\nTurn 78: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 3) at turn t_1 = 73. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimum number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, with y clamped between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move on each freeway (y=1 to 8). For each car, given its head, tail, direction, and speed at turn t_1, I need to compute where it will be at future turns to avoid collisions.\n\nA collision occurs if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 (the x-position) is within its span at that turn T.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} until the next turn, so you only check the car on the current freeway y_T for collision at turn T.\n\nNow, looking at the car states:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: (-33, -44, right, 3)\n\nSince it's right-moving, direction right means it's moving to the right. The span is given as (head, tail). For right-moving cars, the span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I think? Let me check the update rule.\n\nFrom the update:\n\n- Left-moving: span [h, τ] → [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]\n\n- Right-moving: span [τ, h] → [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt]\n\nIn the car state table, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, head should be the front when moving right, so for right-moving, head > tail, and span is [tail, head] or something? I need to interpret the notation.\n\nLook at Freeway 4: (-28, -39, right, 4) — here head is -28, tail is -39, but -28 > -39, so for right-moving, head is greater than tail. Similarly, (8, -3, right, 4): 8 > -3, so head is the larger number.\n\nIn the update, for right-moving: span at t_1 is [τ, h] and becomes [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] at T.\n\nIn the state, it's given as (head, tail), so for right-moving, head is h, tail is τ, so span is [tail, head].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, but here all cars seem right-moving except... in this case, all are right-moving, I think.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3 have cars like (-33,-44,right,3): tail=-44, head=-33? Since it's right-moving, tail is left end, head is right end.\n\nLet's clarify:\n\nFor a right-moving car: at t_1, position: tail τ, head h, with τ < h (since moving right, tail behind head).\n\nSpan: [τ, h] meaning from τ to h inclusive? But positions are integer, I assume.\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right-moving.\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, player is on freeway y_T, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at T.\n\nPlayer position: at turn T, y_T, and x=0.\n\nSo for each freeway and each turn, I need to check if there is a car such that 0 is between τ + sΔt and h + sΔt inclusive.\n\nNow, since positions are integer, we can think of the car occupying integer positions from ceil(τ + sΔt) to floor(h + sΔt) or something? But since s and Δt are integers, and positions integer, the span [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] includes all integers from the lower to upper bound.\n\nSince τ and h are integers, s integer, Δt integer, so τ + sΔt and h + sΔt are integers, so the span is from min to max inclusive.\n\nFor right-moving car: at Δt = T - t_1, position: start = τ + s Δt, end = h + s Δt.\n\nSince τ ≤ h and s>0, start ≤ end.\n\n0 is in span if start ≤ 0 ≤ end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all right.\n\nNow, in this problem, all cars are right-moving, from the data.\n\nFreeway 4 has three cars, all right-moving.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nNow, player starts at y=3.\n\nGoal is y=9.\n\nSo needs to move up to y=9.\n\nBut must avoid being on a freeway when a car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nSince moving up takes at least 6 moves (from 3 to 9, difference 6), but might need more if we have to wait to avoid cars.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the starting turn? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1 for actions, so at turn t_1 + t, action a_{t_1 + t}, for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, position at turn t_1 + H should be (0,9), I think.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nLet’s define the turns.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t_1, player is at (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,3)\n\nThen, player chooses action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nSimilarly, at turn t_1 +1, choose a_{t_1 +1}, get y_{t_1 +2}, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k, position is y_{t_1 + k}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9? That seems odd.\n\nLet's parse the index.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} means actions for turns: a_{t_1 +0}, a_{t_1 +1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nAfter taking action a_{t_1 + t} at turn (t_1 + t), the position becomes y_{t_1 + t +1}.\n\nStandard: at turn t, you are at position (0, y_t), you choose action a_t, then you move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen, at turn t+1, you are at (0, y_{t+1}), and so on.\n\nSo, at start of turn t_1, position (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,3)\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, you go to y_{t_1 +1}\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 +1}, you go to y_{t_1 +2}, ..., after action a_{t_1 + H-1}, you go to y_{t_1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9? But the problem says \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nLet's read: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H - 1} is the position at the start of turn t_1 + H - 1, before taking action.\n\nThen after taking action a_{t_1 + H - 1}, you go to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want to reach (0,9), which should be the position after some action.\n\nI think there might be confusion in indexing.\n\nPerhaps y_t is the position after turn t.\n\nLet's see the game dynamics.\n\n\"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nSo y_{t+1} is the position after action at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, you take action a_t, then move to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at the beginning, at turn t_1, you are at y_{t_1}.\n\nThen you take action a_{t_1}, go to y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, you are at y_{t_1 +1}, take action a_{t_1 +1}, go to y_{t_1 +2}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions: you take actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}, and arrive at y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9), so y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nLet's read carefully:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} is the position at the start of turn t_1 + H - 1, or after?\n\nFrom the update: y_{t+1} is after action at t.\n\nSo at time t, position y_t is before action a_t? No.\n\nLet's define:\n\n- At the start of turn t, player is at position (0, y_t)\n\n- Player chooses action a_t\n\n- Then, player moves to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\n- Now, at the start of turn t+1, player is at (0, y_{t+1})\n\nSimilarly, for cars, at turn t, the car positions are for that turn, and collision is checked based on where the player is at turn t, i.e., y_t, and the car spans at turn t.\n\nThe collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T (the position at start of turn T), and we check cars on that freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nIf you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, so you check cars on y_T at T.\n\nThen after moving, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, check cars on y_{T+1} at T+1.\n\nSo for the position, y_t is the freeway you are on at turn t.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at some turn, meaning at the start of some turn, position is (0,9).\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so we want y_T = 9 for some T.\n\nAnd for that turn, we don't need to take action if we are already there, but we need to specify actions until we arrive.\n\nThe sequence is to be executed until we reach y=9.\n\nIn the sequence {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, after H actions, we have taken H actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and arrived at y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9 means at the start of turn t_1 + H - 1, position is (0,9), but we might not have taken an action yet; we need to take action to stay or something.\n\nI think there's inconsistency.\n\nPerhaps the indexing is different.\n\nLet's look at the action sequence: it starts from t=0 for the first action.\n\nAt turn t_1, action a_{t_1} is the first action.\n\nAfter a_{t_1}, we go to y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nAfter a_{t_1 +1}, go to y_{t_1 +2}, ..., after a_{t_1 + H-1}, go to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9), so y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9 would mean that at the start of turn t_1 + H - 1, we are at y=9, so we don't need to move, but we might take action S to stay, but the position is already 9.\n\nThen after action, we are still at 9.\n\nBut the goal is to reach (0,9), which could be when we are first at y=9.\n\nIn the context, I think y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9 means that after H-1 actions, we are at y=9 at turn t_1 + H - 1.\n\nLet's see the sequence: actions from t=0 to H-1, so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at turn t_1 + t.\n\nAfter action at turn t_1 + t, we go to y_{t_1 + t +1}.\n\nSo after action at turn t_1 + (H-1), we go to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H} = 9 for position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nThe problem says \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\", which is the position before action at turn t_1 + H-1.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the problem statement or my understanding.\n\nPerhaps y_t is defined as position at turn t after action, but the collision is at the start.\n\nLet's read the collision rule carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"y_T\" is the freeway the player is on at turn T.\n\nFrom the player update, at turn T, player is at (0, y_T), so y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nThen, when you take action a_T, you move to y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, you are on y_T, so we check for collision on y_T at turn T.\n\nIf you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, at turn T, you are still on y_T, so you check cars on y_T at T, not on y_{T+1}.\n\nFor the position, we want to be at y_T = 9 for some T.\n\nThe sequence of actions is to be taken until we are at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, after the last action at turn t_1 + H-1, we go to y_{t_1 + H}, and we want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\", which is confusing.\n\nLet's look at the answer format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., and \"Turn t_1 + H - 1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\"\n\nAnd after that, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H} = y_{t_1 + (H-1) +1} = y_{(t_1 + H-1) +1}\n\nBut we want y_some turn = 9.\n\nI think for consistency, since the actions are taken at turns t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and after H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H with position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want this to be 9.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\", so perhaps H is defined such that at turn t_1 + H - 1, we are at y=9, and we may take an action or not, but since we are at 9, we can take S or something.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll assume that we need to reach y=9 at some turn, and H is the number of actions taken.\n\nBut let's proceed with the problem statement: \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\" means that at the start of turn t_1 + H - 1, position is (0,9), so for that turn, we might take action to stay, but the position is already 9.\n\nThen for the sequence, we include actions until we are at 9.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that after k actions, we are at turn t_1 + k with position y_{t_1 + k}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + k} = 9 for some k, and H is the number of actions to reach there, so k = H, and y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9, which suggests that H-1 is the number of actions or something.\n\nI think there's a discrepancy.\n\nLet's calculate the turn indices.\n\nSuppose we start at turn t_1, position y_{t_1} = 3.\n\nAfter 0 actions, we are at y_{t_1} = 3.\n\nAfter 1 action (a_{t_1}), we are at y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nAfter 2 actions (a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}), at y_{t_1+2}, and so on.\n\nAfter m actions, at y_{t_1 + m}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + m} = 9 for some m.\n\nThe minimal m is at least 6, since from 3 to 9, 6 steps up.\n\nH is the number of turns for actions, so the sequence has H actions, so m = H, we arrive at y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\", which would be after H-1 actions, at y_{t_1 + H-1} = 9.\n\nSo for example, if we start at y=9, then H-1=0, H=1, and no action needed, but we need to output something.\n\nBut in this case, we start at 3, not 9.\n\nPerhaps for the sequence, when we are at 9, we don't need to take action, but the sequence includes actions until we reach, but for the turn when we are at 9, we might take S.\n\nI think it's messy.\n\nPerhaps the position y_t is defined as the position at the end of turn t or something.\n\nTo simplify, I'll assume that we need to reach y=9, and H is the number of actions to get there from y=3.\n\nSince from 3 to 9, min 6 actions of U.\n\nBut with cars, it may take more.\n\nAnd for the sequence, we output actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1} such that after these H actions, we are at y=9 at turn t_1 + H.\n\nAnd for collision, at each turn T from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, when we are at y_T, we must not have collision on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H, we are at y=9, and we don't take action, so no collision check for that turn, I think, since we have reached.\n\nThe collision is checked when we are on a freeway during the turn for which we take action.\n\nFor turn t_1 + H, we are at y=9, but if we don't take action, no issue, but in this case, since we reached, we stop.\n\nFor the turns where we take action, from T = t_1 to t_1 + H-1, at each such turn, we are at y_T, and we must avoid collision on y_T at turn T.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H, we are at y=9, no action, so no collision check.\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9), so at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\", which contradicts.\n\nPerhaps in the context, \"turns\" include the starting point.\n\nI think for the sake of solving, I'll proceed with the common sense: we need to go from y=3 to y=9 with min actions, avoiding collision at each step.\n\nLet's list the freeways and cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head = -33, tail = -44, direction right, speed 3.\n\nSince right-moving, span at t_1: [tail, head] = [-44, -33]\n\nAt turn T, span: [ -44 + 3*(T - t_1), -33 + 3*(T - t_1) ]\n\n0 in span if -44 + 3Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -33 + 3Δt, where Δt = T - t_1\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (-33,-44,right,3)\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-33,-44,right,3)\n\nFreeway 4: three cars:\n1. (-28,-39,right,4)  tail=-39, head=-28\n2. (8,-3,right,4)     tail=-3, head=8\n3. (44,33,right,4)    tail=33, head=44? 44>33, but tail=33, head=44, so [33,44]\n\nFor right-moving, tail should be less than head, yes.\n\nAt t_1, car1: span [-39,-28]\ncar2: span [-3,8]\ncar3: span [33,44]\n\nAt T, car1: [-39 +4Δt, -28 +4Δt]\ncar2: [-3 +4Δt, 8 +4Δt]\ncar3: [33+4Δt, 44+4Δt]\n\n0 in car1 span: -39 +4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -28 +4Δt\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars:\n(12,1,right,12)  tail=1, head=12, span [1,12]\n(60,49,right,12) tail=49, head=60, span [49,60]\n\nSpeed 12.\n\nAt T, car1: [1+12Δt, 12+12Δt]\ncar2: [49+12Δt, 60+12Δt]\n\n0 in span for car1: 1+12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 12+12Δt, but 1+12Δt >=1 for Δt>=0, so never <=0, so 0 not in span for car1.\n\nSimilarly car2, 49+12Δt >=49>0, so never <=0, so 0 not in span for any car on freeway 5, for all T, since min position is 1 for car1, which is >0.\n\nCar1 span [1+12Δt,12+12Δt], all positive, so 0 not in it.\n\nCar2 even larger, so on freeway 5, no car ever covers x=0, so it is always safe to be on freeway 5.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5, (12,1,right,12) and (60,49,right,12), so same, always safe.\n\nFreeway 7: same, always safe.\n\nFreeway 8: same, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 4: let's see when 0 is covered.\n\nCar1: [-39 +4Δt, -28 +4Δt]\n\n0 in span if -39 +4Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -28 +4Δt\n\nSo -39 +4Δt <= 0 => 4Δt <= 39 => Δt <= 39/4 = 9.75, so Δt <=9 since integer\n\nAnd 0 <= -28 +4Δt => 4Δt >=28 => Δt >=7\n\nSo for Δt from 7 to 9 inclusive, 0 in car1 span.\n\nCar2: [-3 +4Δt, 8+4Δt]\n\n0 in span if -3+4Δt <=0 and 0<=8+4Δt\n\n-3+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=3 => Δt <= 0.75, so for Δt=0 only? But Δt integer, so -3+4Δt <=0 for Δt<=0, but Δt >=0, so at Δt=0, -3+0=-3<=0, and 0<=8, so yes at Δt=0, 0 in span.\n\n0<=8+4Δt always true for Δt>=0.\n\n-3+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=3 => Δt <= 0.75, so for Δt=0, it is <=0, for Δt>=1, -3+4>=1>0, so not <=0.\n\nSo only at Δt=0, car2 has 0 in span.\n\nCar3: [33+4Δt,44+4Δt], all positive, 0 not in span.\n\nSo on freeway 4, collision if at turn T, either car1 has 0 in span or car2 or car3.\n\nCar2 only at Δt=0, i.e., T=t_1.\n\nCar1 for Δt=7,8,9.\n\nCar3 never.\n\nSo at T=t_1, car2 covers x=0, so collision if on freeway 4 at turn t_1.\n\nFor other times, only when Δt=7,8,9 for car1.\n\nNow freeway 1,2,3: each has one car (-33,-44,right,3)\n\nSpan at t_1: [-44,-33]\n\nAt T: [-44 +3Δt, -33 +3Δt]\n\n0 in span if -44+3Δt <=0 and 0<= -33+3Δt\n\n-44+3Δt <=0 => 3Δt <=44 => Δt <=44/3=14.666, so Δt<=14\n\n0<= -33+3Δt => 3Δt >=33 => Δt >=11\n\nSo for Δt from 11 to 14 inclusive, 0 in span.\n\nSince only one car per freeway for 1,2,3.\n\nNow, player starts at y=3 at turn t_1.\n\nFreeway 3 is y=3.\n\nAt turn t_1, on y=3, we need to check if collision.\n\nFor freeway 3, car: at Δt=0, span [-44,-33], 0 not in it since -33<0, so no collision at t_1.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, we are not on them yet.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and since no freeway above, y=9 is safe, I assume, no cars.\n\nFreeways are from 1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is bottom, y=9 top, both safe.\n\nPlayer can go to y=0 or y=9, no issue.\n\nNow, from y=3, we need to move up to y=9.\n\nBut must avoid being on freeways 1-8 when cars cover x=0.\n\nSpecifically, for each freeway, the dangerous times.\n\nSince we move one step at a time, we need to plan the path.\n\nMin steps: 6 ups, but may need to wait or detour.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the turns when it is dangerous to be on it.\n\nTurn T, with Δt = T - t_1.\n\nFor freeway 1 (y=1): dangerous when Δt from 11 to 14, i.e., T = t_1 +11 to t_1 +14\n\nSimilarly freeway 2 (y=2): same, since same car, dangerous T = t_1 +11 to t_1 +14\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): dangerous T = t_1 +11 to t_1 +14\n\nAt t_1, Δt=0, for y=3, car span [-44,-33], 0 not in, so safe at t_1.\n\nDangerous from t_1+11 to t_1+14.\n\nNow freeway 4 (y=4): dangerous when?\n\nFrom above, at T=t_1, Δt=0, car2 has 0 in span, so dangerous at t_1.\n\nAlso, car1 dangerous for Δt=7,8,9, so T= t_1+7, t_1+8, t_1+9.\n\nCar2 only at t_1.\n\nSo freeway 4 dangerous at T=t_1, and T=t_1+7, t_1+8, t_1+9.\n\nFreeway 5: always safe, as established.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6,7,8: always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=3 at turn t_1.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=5,6,7,8 are always safe (freeways 5-8 safe), and y=9 safe.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, which has dangerous times.\n\ny=3 has dangerous times from t_1+11 to t_1+14.\n\ny=2 and y=1 also dangerous at same times.\n\nBut we start at y=3, which is safe at t_1, but will be dangerous later.\n\nTo go up, we need to go to y=4, but at turn t_1, y=4 is dangerous because of car2.\n\nAt turn t_1, if we are on y=4, collision, but we start on y=3, not on y=4.\n\nAt turn t_1, we are on y=3, safe.\n\nWe take action at turn t_1 to move to y=4 or stay or down.\n\nIf we move to y=4 at turn t_1, that means after action at t_1, we go to y=4 at turn t_1+1? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T, we are on y_T.\n\nWe take action a_T, then go to y_{T+1}.\n\nFor collision at turn T, we are on y_T, and check cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nAt turn t_1, we are on y=3, and it is safe, as above.\n\nIf we take action U, then we go to y_{t_1+1} = 4.\n\nThen at turn t_1+1, we are on y=4.\n\nAt turn t_1+1, Δt = (t_1+1) - t_1 =1.\n\nFor freeway 4 at Δt=1, car1 span: [-39+4(1), -28+4(1)] = [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nCar2 span: [-3+4(1), 8+4(1)] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nCar3: [33+4,44+4]=[37,48], no.\n\nSo at Δt=1, freeway 4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t_1, freeway 4 is dangerous only at Δt=0.\n\nBut at turn t_1, we are not on y=4, so no issue.\n\nNow, to go to y=4, we need to be at turn t_1+1 on y=4.\n\nAt that time, Δt=1, safe for y=4.\n\nThen we can go up.\n\nBut y=3 will be dangerous later, from t_1+11 to 14.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 dangerous at t_1+7,8,9.\n\nBut since we can move fast, we might avoid those times.\n\nMin steps to y=9 is 6, so we can reach by t_1+6.\n\nLet's see the dangerous times relative to t_1.\n\nDangerous for y=4 at T= t_1+7,8,9\n\nFor y=3 at T= t_1+11 to 14\n\nBut t_1+7 to9 is earlier than t_1+11 to14.\n\nSince we start at t_1, and go up, at turn t_1, we are at y=3.\n\nTake action at each turn.\n\nSuppose we go directly up.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t_1: action U, go to y=4 at turn t_1+1\n\nAt turn t_1+1, position y=4, which is safe as above.\n\nTurn t_1+1: action U, go to y=5 at turn t_1+2\n\ny=5 is freeway 5, always safe.\n\nTurn t_1+2: U, to y=6\n\ny=6 safe\n\nTurn t_1+3: U, to y=7\n\nsafe\n\nTurn t_1+4: U, to y=8\n\nsafe\n\nTurn t_1+5: U, to y=9\n\nAt turn t_1+5, we are at y=8, take U, go to y=9 at turn t_1+6.\n\nNow, at turn t_1+6, position y=9, goal reached.\n\nNow, check for collision during the process.\n\nAt each turn from t_1 to t_1+5, we are on a freeway and must be safe.\n\nTurn t_1: on y=3, Δt=0, safe as above.\n\nTurn t_1+1: on y=4, Δt=1, for freeway 4, as above, safe.\n\nTurn t_1+2: on y=5, safe.\n\nSimilarly t_1+3, y=6 safe; t_1+4, y=7 safe; t_1+5, on y=8, safe.\n\nAll safe, and we reached in 6 turns.\n\nBut is that possible? Earlier I thought y=4 is dangerous at t_1, but at t_1 we are not on y=4, at t_1+1 we are on y=4 at Δt=1, which is safe.\n\nDangerous at t_1 for y=4 only if we are on it at turn t_1, but we are not.\n\nSimilarly, other dangerous times like t_1+7 for y=4, but we are at y=4 at turn t_1+1, which is before t_1+7, so not affected.\n\nSimilarly for y=3, dangerous later, but we leave early.\n\nSo in this case, we can go directly up in 6 steps with no problem.\n\nBut let's confirm freeway 4 at turn t_1+1.\n\nΔt=1, car1: [-39+4(1), -28+4(1)] = [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\ncar2: [-3+4(1), 8+4(1)] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\ncar3: [37,48], no.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd at turn t_1, on y=3, car span [-44,-33], 0 not in.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,3), and we go to (0,9) in 6 moves.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 always safe, as established.\n\nBut freeway 5 has cars, but they never cover x=0, so yes.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut in freeway 4, at t_1, it is dangerous, but we are not on it.\n\nSo this seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nH=6 actions.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1+1: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1+5: U\n\nAfter turn t_1+5 action U, at turn t_1+6 position y=9.\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H} = y_{t_1+6} =9, with H=6.\n\nBut the problem says y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which would be y_{t_1+5}=9.\n\nIn this case, at turn t_1+5, we are on y=8, take U, go to y=9 at t_1+6.\n\nSo at turn t_1+5, y_{t_1+5}=8, not 9.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nAccording to the problem.\n\nPerhaps I need to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThat means at the start of turn t_1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nFor example, if we take fewer actions.\n\nStart at t_1, y=3.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k, position y_{t_1 + k}.\n\nWe want for some m, y_{t_1 + m} =9.\n\nThen H-1 = m, so that at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nThen the sequence of actions is from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2} to reach there? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + t} at turn t_1 + t, we go to y_{t_1 + t +1}.\n\nSo after all actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1, before taking action at that turn.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, we need to be at y=9 at the start of turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen, for that turn, we take action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which could be S, to stay, or U or D, but since y=9, if we go U or D, it might go out of bound, but y_{t+1} = min(max(y_t + Δy, 0),9), so at y=9, U or D will stay or go down, but we want to stay at 9 probably.\n\nBut in the sequence, we include the action for turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nSince we are at y=9, we can take S.\n\nFor example, to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt turn t_1, y=3.\n\nIf we take actions to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at turn T.\n\nThen y_T =9.\n\nThen T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo for example, with 6 actions: after 6 actions, we are at y_{t_1 +6} =9.\n\nThen y_{t_1 +6} =9, so t_1 +6 = t_1 + H -1, so H-1 =6, H=7.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +6, position y=9.\n\nThen we take action at turn t_1 +6, which could be S.\n\nBut we are already at 9.\n\nThe sequence has H=7 actions: from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+6}.\n\nBut the first 6 actions are U to go up, and at turn t_1+6, we take S to stay at 9.\n\nBut we reached at turn t_1+6.\n\nIn terms of turns, at turn t_1+6, we are at y=9 before action, then take S, stay at 9.\n\nBut the position is already 9 at the start of the turn.\n\nTo minimize H, we should reach as soon as possible.\n\nMin turns to reach y=9 from y=3 is 6 actions, arriving at turn t_1+6 with y=9.\n\nThen to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, we set H-1 =6, so H=7, and at turn t_1+6, we are at y=9, and we take action S.\n\nBut that adds an extra turn where we do nothing.\n\nWe can reach at turn t_1+6 with y=9 after 6 actions.\n\nBut to satisfy y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, we need H-1 =6, so H=7, and we output 7 actions, including the last S.\n\nBut that seems inefficient, but for the sequence, it might be required.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 7 with the last action S.\n\nBut in terms of reaching, it takes 6 moves, but H includes the action when we are already there.\n\nTo confirm, suppose we start at y=9, then at turn t_1, y=9, so we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so if H=1, then y_{t_1 +0} = y_{t_1} =9, and we take action a_{t_1}, which could be S.\n\nIf no action, but H=1, we output one action.\n\nSimilarly here, from y=3 to y=9 in 6 moves, we arrive at turn t_1+6.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, we set t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +6, so H-1=6, H=7.\n\nThen the actions: for t=0 to 6, actions at turn t_1 to t_1+6.\n\nActions: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+5} are U, to move up, and a_{t_1+6} is S, to stay.\n\nBut at turn t_1+6, we are already at y=9, so taking S is fine.\n\nIn the collision check, at turn t_1+6, we are on y=9, which has no cars, so safe.\n\nBut we only need to check up to the turn before we reach if we move, but here we reach at turn t_1+6.\n\nIn this case, for the direct path, with 6 moves, we can reach, but to output, we need H=7 with the last S.\n\nBut that seems redundant.\n\nPerhaps the problem allows that when we reach, we stop, but the sequence includes only the actions to reach.\n\nI think for this problem, since the direct path works, I'll go with that.\n\nBut let's see if there is any issue with the cars.\n\nIn the direct path:\n\nTurn t_1: on y=3, safe\n\nAction U, go to y=4 at t_1+1\n\nTurn t_1+1: on y=4, Δt=1, safe as above\n\nAction U, to y=5 at t_1+2\n\nTurn t_1+2: on y=5, safe\n\nU to y=6 at t_1+3\n\nOn y=6 safe\n\nU to y=7 at t_1+4\n\nOn y=7 safe\n\nU to y=8 at t_1+5\n\nOn y=8 safe\n\nU to y=9 at t_1+6\n\nAt turn t_1+6, on y=9, safe, reached.\n\nNow, for the sequence with H such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nHere y_{t_1+5} =8, not 9.\n\ny_{t_1+6} =9.\n\nSo to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, we need to be at y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo for example, if we take only 5 actions: U,U,U,U,U, then from y=3, after 5 U, we go to y=8 at turn t_1+5.\n\nThen y_{t_1+5} =8.\n\nNot 9.\n\nThen at turn t_1+5, on y=8, take U to go to 9.\n\nBut y_{t_1+5} =8.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, we need to reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo the earliest is at turn t_1+6 with y=9.\n\nThen set t_1 + H -1 = t_1+6, so H-1=6, H=7.\n\nThen at turn t_1+6, y=9, and we take action S for that turn.\n\nSequence: actions for turn t_1 to t_1+6.\n\na_{t_1}: U to go to 4\n\na_{t_1+1}: U to 5\n\na_{t_1+2}: U to 6\n\na_{t_1+3}: U to 7\n\na_{t_1+4}: U to 8\n\na_{t_1+5}: U to 9  (after action, at turn t_1+6, y=9)\n\nNow at turn t_1+6, position y=9, we take action a_{t_1+6}: S to stay at 9.\n\nThen y_{t_1+7} =9, but we are done at turn t_1+6.\n\nWith H=7 actions, we have turns from t_1 to t_1+6, and after action a_{t_1+6}, we go to y_{t_1+7}, but we want y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1+6} =9.\n\nAt turn t_1+6, before action, y=9, then we take action S, go to y=9.\n\nSo in the sequence, for turn t_1+6, we output S.\n\nBut it is unnecessary, but to satisfy the format.\n\nPerhaps for the minimal H, we can have H=6 with the last action moving to 9.\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1+5} =8, not 9.\n\nSo we must have H such that at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nSo min H is 7, with the first 6 actions U, and the 7th action S at turn t_1+6.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier.\n\nFrom y=3, min 6 steps to y=9, so cannot reach before turn t_1+6.\n\nAt turn t_1, y=3, after 0 actions, y=3.\n\nAfter 1 action, y=4 at t_1+1, etc.\n\nAfter 5 actions, y=8 at t_1+5.\n\nAfter 6 actions, y=9 at t_1+6.\n\nSo the earliest turn to be at y=9 is t_1+6.\n\nSo for y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, we need t_1 + H -1 = t_1+6, so H-1=6, H=7.\n\nThen the sequence has 7 actions.\n\nActions: for turn t_1: U\n\nt_1+1: U\n\nt_1+2: U\n\nt_1+3: U\n\nt_1+4: U\n\nt_1+5: U\n\nt_1+6: S\n\nAnd at turn t_1+6, before action, y=9, so y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1+6} =9 with H=7.\n\nThen after action S, still at 9.\n\nFor collision, during the actions, from turn t_1 to t_1+5, we are on y=3 to y=8, all safe as before, and at turn t_1+6, on y=9, safe, no collision.\n\nSo it works with H=7.\n\nBut since the last S is trivial, and we reached at turn t_1+6, but to satisfy the problem, I think we need to include it.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that after H-1 actions, we are at y=9, but the sequence has H actions including the last one when we are there.\n\nI think for this case, since the direct path works, I'll go with the sequence to move up directly.\n\nBut in the output, for the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut let's see if there is any reason to wait or something, but in this case, no need.\n\nPerhaps for y=4, at later times it is dangerous, but since we pass at t_1+1, early, no issue.\n\nSimilarly for y=3, we leave at t_1+1 to y=4, so at later dangerous times, we are not on y=3.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 7 with the sequence including the final S, or H=6 with only moves, but to match the format, I think H=6 with actions to move, and we reach at turn t_1+6.\n\nBut the problem requires y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo I think we must have H=7.\n\nPerhaps for this specific state, since we can reach in 6 actions, but the position at t_1+5 is 8, not 9.\n\nSo let's accept H=7.\n\nBut to be precise, let's assume that we need to output the sequence with H such that after the actions, we have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for the move, with 6 U, we have y_{t_1+6} =9, so to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, set t_1 + H -1 = t_1+6, so H-1=6, H=7, and the last action is S at turn t_1+6.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1+1: U\n\nTurn t_1+2: U\n\nTurn t_1+3: U\n\nTurn t_1+4: U\n\nTurn t_1+5: U\n\nTurn t_1+6: S\n\nBut in the action, at turn t_1+5, we take U to go to 9, so at turn t_1+6, we are at 9.\n\nThen at turn t_1+6, we take S.\n\nYes.\n\nSince the problem says \"avoiding collisions\", and at turn t_1+6, we are on y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nNow, for the cars, in this path, we never encounter a collision, as we are not on the dangerous turns for any freeway.\n\nDangerous for y=4 at t_1+7,8,9, but we are on y=4 at t_1+1, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo this should be minimal H=7.\n\nBut H=7 turns for actions, but we reached in 6 moves.\n\nPerhaps we can start by staying or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=3 for some turns, but since min is 6, and no need to wait, better to go directly.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 4, there is a car at (8,-3,right,4), and at t_1, it covers x=0, so if we were on y=4 at t_1, collision, but we are not.\n\nAt t_1+1, it has moved to [1,12], not covering 0.\n\nSo ok.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7, with the sequence above.\n\nBut let's write the answer.\n\nFirst, current turn t_1=73.\n\nPlayer position (0,3)\n\nSequence for H=7:\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: S\n\nIn terms of turns, t_1 + t for t=0 to 6.\n\nTurn 73: a_{73} = U\n\nTurn 74: a_{74} = U\n\n...\n\nTurn 78: a_{78} = U\n\nTurn 79: a_{79} = S\n\nAnd y at turn 79 (t_1 +6) is 9, and H=7, so t_1 + H -1 =73 +7-1=79, yes.\n\nNow, to confirm, is there a shorter way? No, because we need at least 6 moves to increase y by 6.\n\nWith 5 actions, we can be at y=8 at turn t_1+5, but not 9.\n\nThen to be at 9, we need the 6th action.\n\nSo min H=7.\n\nPerhaps with down and up, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nSo this is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, the last S is not necessary, but to satisfy the condition.\n\nPerhaps the problem allows H=6 with only U, and y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1+5} =8, not 9, so not satisfied.\n\nSo I think H=7 is required.\n\nAnother idea: we can reach y=9 at turn t_1+6 with 6 actions, and for the sequence, H=6, then y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1+5} =8, not 9, but we want it to be 9, so not.\n\nUnless we define differently.\n\nI think I should stick to the problem.\n\nSo for the answer, H=7.\n\nBut let's see the box.\n\nPerhaps for this specific setup, since freeways 5-8 are safe, and we go through quickly, no issue.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if at any point we might be on a dangerous freeway.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1+7, if we were on y=4, it would be dangerous, but in our sequence, at t_1+7, we are on y=9 or something.\n\nt_1+7: from above, at turn t_1+6, we are on y=9, take S, so at turn t_1+7, we are still on y=9.\n\nBut we don't care after reaching.\n\nIn the sequence, we stop at action for turn t_1+6.\n\nBut at turn t_1+7, we are not taking action, so no collision check.\n\nSo fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is as above.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 73\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Hazards\n- **Freeways 1, 2, and 3**: Each has a car with initial span \\([-44, -33]\\) moving right at speed 3. These freeways are hazardous at turns \\(t_1 + 11\\) to \\(t_1 + 14\\) (i.e., turns 84 to 87) because the car spans include x=0 during these turns.\n- **Freeway 4**: Has three cars:\n  - Car 1: Initial span \\([-39, -28]\\), moving right at speed 4. Hazardous at turns \\(t_1 + 7\\) to \\(t_1 + 9\\) (turns 80 to 82).\n  - Car 2: Initial span \\([-3, 8]\\), moving right at speed 4. Hazardous only at turn \\(t_1\\) (turn 73) because x=0 is in the span at \\(\\Delta t = 0\\).\n  - Car 3: Initial span \\([33, 44]\\), moving right at speed 4. Never hazardous as the span is always positive.\n- **Freeways 5, 6, 7, and 8**: Each has cars that never cover x=0 due to their initial positions and speeds (e.g., freeway 5 cars have spans starting at 1 or higher and moving right at speed 12). These freeways are always safe.\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3) at turn 73, which is safe at this turn since x=0 is not in the car span \\([-44, -33]\\) at \\(\\Delta t = 0\\).\n\n### Path to Reach \\(y = 9\\)\nThe minimal path involves moving directly upward from \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 9\\) in 6 moves (actions U at each turn), arriving at \\(y = 9\\) by turn 79. However, the problem requires that \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\\), meaning the player must be at position (0, 9) at the start of turn \\(t_1 + H - 1\\).\n\n- After 6 actions (U at turns 73 to 78), the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 79 (since \\(y_{79} = 9\\) after the action at turn 78).\n- To satisfy \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\\), set \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 79\\). With \\(t_1 = 73\\), this gives \\(H - 1 = 6\\), so \\(H = 7\\).\n- At turn 79, the player is already at \\(y = 9\\), so action S (stay) is taken to remain at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns 73 to 79 is:\n- Turns 73 to 78: Action U to move upward.\n- Turn 79: Action S to stay at \\(y = 9\\).\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification\n- **Turn 73 (y=3)**: Safe, as car span on freeway 3 is \\([-44, -33]\\), not including x=0.\n- **Turn 74 (y=4)**: \\(\\Delta t = 1\\), car spans on freeway 4 are:\n  - Car 1: \\([-39 + 4 \\times 1, -28 + 4 \\times 1] = [-35, -24]\\) (no x=0)\n  - Car 2: \\([-3 + 4 \\times 1, 8 + 4 \\times 1] = [1, 12]\\) (no x=0)\n  - Car 3: \\([33 + 4 \\times 1, 44 + 4 \\times 1] = [37, 48]\\) (no x=0). Safe.\n- **Turn 75 (y=5)**: Freeway 5 always safe (no car covers x=0).\n- **Turn 76 (y=6)**: Freeway 6 always safe.\n- **Turn 77 (y=7)**: Freeway 7 always safe.\n- **Turn 78 (y=8)**: Freeway 8 always safe.\n- **Turn 79 (y=9)**: No freeway above y=8, so safe.\n\nThe hazardous turns for freeways 1-4 (e.g., turns 80-82 for y=4 and 84-87 for y=3) are avoided, as the player moves quickly upward and is at y=9 by turn 79.\n\n### Minimal Sequence\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 7, with the sequence of actions below. The player reaches (0, 9) at the start of turn 79 (\\(y_{79} = 9\\)), satisfying the condition.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 73: U \\\\\nTurn 74: U \\\\\nTurn 75: U \\\\\nTurn 76: U \\\\\nTurn 77: U \\\\\nTurn 78: U \\\\\nTurn 79: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 5) at turn t_1 = 75. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move on specific freeways, and for each freeway, there are cars defined by their head, tail, direction, and speed. Collision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nImportant point: if the player moves to a different y at turn T, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, the player is on y_T, and after action, they move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nThe car spans are updated based on the time elapsed. Since we start at t_1=75, for any future turn T, the time elapsed is T - 75.\n\nLet me denote the starting turn as t_start = 75.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, with initial head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s:\n\n- If left-moving, span at time T is [h - s*(T - t_start), τ - s*(T - t_start)]\n\n- If right-moving, span is [τ + s*(T - t_start), h + s*(T - t_start)]\n\nIn the car state, for left-moving, head is at the left, tail at right? Let's see the notation.\n\nFor left-moving: \"head at h, tail at τ\" and span [h, τ] then becomes [h - s*Δt, τ - s*Δt], so as time increases, the car moves left, so h decreases.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: span [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt], so τ and h increase.\n\nIn the input, for right-moving, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s), but for right-moving, head should be the front, which is right, so when moving right, head has higher x.\n\nIn the update:\n\nFor right-moving: initial span [τ, h], then at T, [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt]. Since it's moving right, τ and h both increase.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h, τ] to [h - s*Δt, τ - s*Δt], both decrease.\n\nBut in the collision condition, we care about whether x=0 is in the span at time T for the freeway the player is on at that turn.\n\nPlayer is on y at turn T if position is (0, y) at that turn.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-27, -38, right, 3)  direction right, so it's right-moving.\n\nInitial span: since right, head is -27, tail is -38? That seems odd because for right-moving, head should be larger, but here head=-27, tail=-38, and -27 > -38, so head is at x=-27, tail at x=-38, so the car is from x=-38 to x=-27? But direction right, so as it moves right, x increases.\n\nAt time t_start=75, span for this car: since right-moving, the span is [tail, head] = [-38, -27], I think. From the update rule: for right-moving, initial span is [τ, h] given as, but in the input it's (head h, tail τ), so for this car, h=-27, τ=-38.\n\nFor right-moving, the span is [τ, h] = [-38, -27].\n\nThen at turn T, span is [τ + s*(T-75), h + s*(T-75)] = [-38 + 3*(T-75), -27 + 3*(T-75)]\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nBut we need to find when this car has 0 in its span for freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nThe player starts at y=5, and needs to go to y=9, so must move up at least 4 times. But there are cars on the way, so might need to wait or avoid.\n\nMinimal H would be at least 4, if no cars, but there are cars, so might be more.\n\nBut let's see the cars on each freeway from y=1 to 8.\n\nFirst, list all cars and their positions over time.\n\nSince we care about when x=0 is covered for each freeway at different times.\n\nFor each freeway k, we need to find the times when there is a car such that 0 is in its span, meaning the player cannot be on that freeway at that time.\n\nPlayer is on freeway y at turn T only if y_T = y.\n\nSo for each y and each T, we can determine if it is occupied at T.\n\nBut T is future, from t_start=75 onwards.\n\nNow, let's go freeway by freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-27, -38, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, so at time T, span: [ -38 + 3*(T-75) , -27 + 3*(T-75) ]\n\nSet x=0 in span:\n\nLower bound L1(T) = -38 + 3*(T-75)\n\nUpper bound U1(T) = -27 + 3*(T-75)\n\n0 in [L1(T), U1(T)] if L1(T) <= 0 <= U1(T)\n\nL1(T) <= 0: -38 + 3(T-75) <= 0 => 3(T-75) <= 38 => T-75 <= 38/3 ≈ 12.666, so T <= 75 + 12.666 = 87.666, since T integer, T <= 87\n\n0 <= U1(T): 0 <= -27 + 3(T-75) => 3(T-75) >= 27 => T-75 >= 9, so T >= 84\n\nThus, for T from 84 to 87 inclusive, freeway 1 is occupied at x=0.\n\nT=84: L1(84) = -38 + 3(9) = -38 + 27 = -11, U1= -27 + 27=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included.\n\nT=85: L1= -38 + 3(10)= -38+30= -8, U1= -27+30=3, [ -8,3], 0 in\n\nT=86: L1= -38+33= -5, U1= -27+33=6, [ -5,6]\n\nT=87: L1= -38+36= -2, U1= -27+36=9, [ -2,9]\n\nT=88: L1= -38+39=1, U1= -27+39=12, [1,12], 0 not in since 0<1\n\nT=83: L1= -38 + 3(8)= -38+24= -14, U1= -27+24= -3, [ -14,-3], 0 not in\n\nSo freeway 1 occupied at T=84,85,86,87.\n\nNow freeway 2: similar, (-27, -38, right, 3) same as freeway 1, so also occupied T=84 to 87.\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-27, -38, right, 3), so T=84 to 87 occupied.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-20, -31, right, 4)\n\nDirection right, so at T, span: [ τ + s*(T-75), h + s*(T-75) ] with τ=-31, h=-20, s=4\n\nSo L_c1(T) = -31 + 4*(T-75)\n\nU_c1(T) = -20 + 4*(T-75)\n\n0 in [L,U] if L <=0 and 0<=U\n\nL <=0: -31 +4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=31 => Δt <=31/4=7.75, so T-75 <=7, T<=82\n\n0<=U: 0<= -20 +4Δt => 4Δt >=20 => Δt >=5, T>=80\n\nSo for T from 80 to 82 inclusive? T=80: L= -31 +4(5)= -31+20= -11, U= -20+20=0, so [ -11,0], 0 in\n\nT=81: L= -31+24= -7, U= -20+24=4, [ -7,4]\n\nT=82: L= -31+28= -3, U= -20+28=8, [ -3,8]\n\nT=83: L= -31+32=1, U= -20+32=12, [1,12], 0 not <=U? 0<1, not in\n\nT=79: L= -31+16= -15, U= -20+16= -4, [ -15,-4], 0 not in\n\nSo car1 on freeway4 occupied T=80,81,82.\n\nNow second car on freeway4: (16, 5, right, 4)\n\nHead=16, tail=5? Direction right, so span at start: [τ, h] = [5,16]? Input is (head h, tail τ), so for right, head is larger, so τ=5, h=16.\n\nIn the update: for right-moving, span is [τ, h] initially.\n\nAt T, [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] = [5 + 4*(T-75), 16 + 4*(T-75)]\n\nL_c2(T) = 5 + 4Δt\n\nU_c2(T) = 16 + 4Δt\n\n0 in [L,U] if L <=0 <=U\n\nBut L =5 +4Δt >=5 >0 for all T>=75, so L>0, so 0 cannot be <=U when L>0, since L is min.\n\nSince L =5 +4Δt >0 for all Δt>=0, so 0 is never in the span because the span is always positive x, so no issue for this car, x=0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (52, 41, right, 4)\n\nHead=52, tail=41, both positive, direction right, span [41,52] at start, at T [41+4Δt, 52+4Δt], always greater than 41>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSo only first car matters for freeway4, occupied T=80,81,82.\n\nBut freeway4 has multiple cars, but only one can occupy x=0 at a time, but we need to check if any car covers x=0 at T.\n\nHere, car1 covers T=80,81,82, others don't, so freeway4 occupied at T=80,81,82.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst: (36, 25, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, head=36, tail=25, so span [25,36] at start, at T [25 +12*(T-75), 36 +12*(T-75)]\n\nL=25+12Δt >0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSecond car: (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nHead=-36, tail=-47, direction right.\n\nSpan at start: [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt T: [ -47 +12*(T-75), -36 +12*(T-75) ]\n\n0 in [L,U] if L <=0 and 0<=U\n\nL <=0: -47 +12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <=47 => Δt <=47/12≈3.916, so T-75 <=3, T<=78\n\n0<=U: 0<= -36 +12Δt => 12Δt >=36 => Δt >=3, T>=78\n\nT=78: L= -47 +12*3= -47+36= -11, U= -36+36=0, [ -11,0], 0 in\n\nT=79: L= -47+48=1, U= -36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nT=77: L= -47+24= -23, U= -36+24= -12, [ -23,-12], 0 not in\n\nSo only at T=78, occupied.\n\nT=78: Δt=3, L= -47+36= -11, U= -36+36=0, [ -11,0], yes.\n\nT=79: Δt=4, L= -47+48=1, U= -36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway5 occupied only at T=78.\n\nNow freeway6: same as freeway5, two cars: (36,25,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nSame as above, (36,25) never covers 0, (-36,-47) covers only at T=78.\n\nSo freeway6 occupied at T=78.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7: same, occupied at T=78.\n\nFreeway8: same, occupied at T=78.\n\nFreeway8 has the same cars? From the table:\n\n| 8 | (36, 25, right, 12), (-36, -47, right, 12) |\n\nYes, same as 5,6,7.\n\nSo summary of occupied times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: occupied T=84,85,86,87\n\n- Freeway 2: occupied T=84,85,86,87\n\n- Freeway 3: occupied T=84,85,86,87\n\n- Freeway 4: occupied T=80,81,82\n\n- Freeway 5: occupied T=78\n\n- Freeway 6: occupied T=78\n\n- Freeway 7: occupied T=78\n\n- Freeway 8: occupied T=78\n\nT is the turn number, starting from 75.\n\nPlayer starts at T=75, y=5.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nEach turn, player can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\ny must be integer between 0 and 9.\n\nAt each turn T, if player is on y at T, and y is occupied at T, collision.\n\nBut note that when player moves, at turn T, they are on y_T, and after action, to y_{T+1}.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn based on current position.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=5, minimal moves: need at least 4 up moves, but can have stays or even down, but down would be counterproductive, so probably only up and stay.\n\nSince we need to avoid occupied times, we might need to wait on some rows.\n\nNow, let's list the occupied times:\n\ny=1: occ 84-87\n\ny=2: occ 84-87\n\ny=3: occ 84-87\n\ny=4: occ 80-82\n\ny=5: no occupation? Freeway 5 is y=5? Freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\ny=5: from above, freeway 5 occupied only at T=78.\n\nBut T=78 is before current? t_start=75, T=78 is future, but 78>75, so yes.\n\nAt T=75, y=5, is it occupied?\n\nFor y=5, occupied only at T=78.\n\nAt T=75, is freeway 5 occupied? From above, no, only at 78.\n\nSimilarly, y=6: freeway 6, occupied at T=78\n\ny=7: T=78\n\ny=8: T=78\n\ny=4: T=80,81,82\n\ny=1,2,3: T=84-87\n\ny=9 is the goal, no cars, so always safe.\n\ny=0 is bottom, but we start at 5, going to 9, so probably not going to 0.\n\nNow, player at T=75, y=5.\n\ny=5 is safe at T=75, since not occupied.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nPossible to go directly up? But y=6,7,8 might be occupied at T=78.\n\nFirst, let's find the minimal H.\n\nSince we start at T=75, and need to go to y=9.\n\nEach step, y increases by at most 1.\n\nSo if no obstacles, can reach in 4 turns: T=75 y=5, T=76 y=6, T=77 y=7, T=78 y=8, T=79 y=9? Let's see the turns.\n\nAt turn T, position is (0, y_T)\n\nAfter action, at turn T+1, position y_{T+1}\n\nTo be at y=9 at some turn H, meaning y_H =9.\n\nStart: T=75, y=5\n\nAfter one action, T=76, y_{76} = y_75 + Δy\n\nIf we go up each time:\n\nT=75: y=5\n\nAction U: T=76, y=6\n\nAction U: T=77, y=7\n\nAction U: T=78, y=8\n\nAction U: T=79, y=9\n\nBut at T=78, y=8, and freeway 8 is occupied at T=78? Yes, from above.\n\nFreeway 8 occupied at T=78, so if player is on y=8 at T=78, collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at T=78 occupied, y=6 at T=78 occupied.\n\nAll y=5,6,7,8 occupied at T=78? y=5 occupied at T=78, y=6 at T=78, etc.\n\nBut at T=75, y=5 is safe, since not occupied.\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=78, if y=8, and freeway 8 occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we try to be on y=7 at T=78, occupied, etc.\n\nBut at T=78, y=5,6,7,8 are all occupied? y=5: freeway 5 occupied at T=78, y=6: freeway 6 at T=78, y=7: freeway 7 at T=78, y=8: freeway 8 at T=78.\n\nYes, all occupied at T=78.\n\nBut y=4: occupied at T=80,81,82, not at T=78.\n\ny=3: occupied at 84-87, not at 78.\n\ny=2: same, y=1 same.\n\ny=9: safe.\n\nSo at T=78, the only safe rows are y=0,1,2,3,4,9? y=4 not occupied at T=78, since occupied only 80-82.\n\ny=4: freeway 4 occupied T=80,81,82, so at T=78, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 not occupied until 84.\n\nSo at T=78, safe rows: y=0,1,2,3,4,9 (since y=9 no freeway, always safe)\n\nBut y=1,2,3 are freeways, but not occupied at T=78.\n\ny=1 occupied from 84, etc., not at 78.\n\nSimilarly y=2,3.\n\nSo at T=78, all y except 5,6,7,8 are safe.\n\nNow back to the path.\n\nIf we go directly up:\n\nT=75: y=5 (safe, not occ)\n\nT=76: if go U, y=6\n\nBut at T=76, is y=6 occupied? Freeway 6 occupied only at T=78, not at T=76, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=77: y=7, freeway 7 occupied only at T=78, not 77, so safe.\n\nT=78: if y=8, occupied, collision.\n\nProblem at T=78.\n\nIf at T=77, we don't go to y=8, but stay or down.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nSince at T=78, y=5-8 are occupied, we must not be on those rows at T=78.\n\nSo player must be on y<=4 or y=9 at T=78.\n\nBut y=9 is far, from y=5 at T=75, to y=9 in 3 turns? T=75 y=5, T=76 y=6, T=77 y=7, T=78 y=8 or less, not 9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=78, need to increase by 4 in 3 steps? From T=75 to T=78, it's 3 actions: actions at T=75,76,77 to reach position at T=78.\n\nPosition at T is after action at T-1? Let's clarify.\n\nAt the start of turn T, position is (0, y_T)\n\nThen player chooses action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T\n\nFor turn T, the position is y_T when the action is taken, and collision is based on y_T at that turn.\n\nAfter action, position changes for next turn.\n\nSo sequence:\n\n- At turn T=75: position y_75=5, choose action a_75, then y_76 = y_75 + Δy_75\n\n- At turn T=76: position y_76, choose a_76, then y_77 = y_76 + Δy_76\n\n- At turn T=77: position y_77, choose a_77, then y_78 = y_77 + Δy_77\n\n- At turn T=78: position y_78, choose a_78, etc.\n\nWe need y_H =9 for some H.\n\nNow at T=78, if y_78 is between 5 and 8, collision, since all occupied.\n\nSo y_78 must be <=4 or 9.\n\nBut from y_75=5, in three actions (at T=75,76,77), we can reach y_78.\n\ny_78 = y_75 + Δy_75 + Δy_76 + Δy_77\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so y_78 between 5-3=2 and 5+3=8.\n\nSo y_78 can be 2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nCannot be 9 or less than 2? y min 0, but here min 2, max 8.\n\nSo y_78 cannot be 9 or <=1? Can be 2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut at T=78, y=5,6,7,8 collision, so only possible safe y_78 are 2,3,4.\n\ny=2,3,4 are safe at T=78, since not occupied.\n\nThen from there, we can go to y=9 later.\n\nBut we need to minimize H, so we want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nFirst, to avoid collision at T=78, we must have y_78 <=4.\n\nThen we can proceed to y=9.\n\nBut we also have other occupied times to consider.\n\nFor example, y=4 is occupied at T=80,81,82, so if we are on y=4 at those times, collision.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nNow, let's list all occupied times again:\n\ny=1: occ T=84,85,86,87\n\ny=2: same, T=84-87\n\ny=3: same, T=84-87\n\ny=4: occ T=80,81,82\n\ny=5: occ only T=78\n\ny=6: occ T=78\n\ny=7: occ T=78\n\ny=8: occ T=78\n\ny=5,6,7,8 only at T=78, and y=4 at 80-82, y=1,2,3 at 84-87.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nStart T=75, y=5, safe.\n\nWe need to set y_78 <=4 to avoid collision at T=78.\n\ny_78 <=4, and since y_75=5, we need to decrease y or stay, but to reach y=9 eventually, decreasing might not be efficient.\n\nBut necessary to avoid T=78.\n\nSo for example, at T=75, we could do S or D to not increase y.\n\nThen at T=76, similarly.\n\nBut let's plan the sequence.\n\nFirst, from T=75 to T=78, we need y_78 <=4.\n\nSince y_75=5, to have y_78 <=4, the sum of Δy from T=75 to T=77 must be <= -1.\n\ny_78 = y_75 + Δy_75 + Δy_76 + Δy_77\n\nSet to <=4, so 5 + sum Δy <=4, so sum Δy <= -1.\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so possible to have one D and two S, or two D and one U, etc., but since we want to go up eventually, probably minimal down.\n\nFor example, do D once and S twice, so y decreases by 1 over three turns.\n\nOr D twice, but that would be lower.\n\nBut let's see the positions.\n\nAfter T=78, we can go up to y=9.\n\nBut we need to avoid occupied times.\n\nFirst, let's get to a safe position at T=78.\n\nSuppose we set y_78 =4.\n\nThen at T=78, y=4, which is safe since not occupied at T=78.\n\nNow, from there, we can go up to y=5,6,etc.\n\nBut y=4 is occupied at T=80,81,82, so we cannot be on y=4 at those times.\n\nSimilarly, other rows have future occupations.\n\nNow, at T=78, y=4.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nFrom y=4 to y=9, need at least 5 up moves.\n\nBut we can do it in 5 turns: T=78 y=4, U to y=5 at T=79, U to y=6 at T=80, etc.\n\nBut check the times.\n\nT=78: y=4, safe\n\nAction a_78: if U, then y_79 =5\n\nT=79: position y=5, now at T=79, is y=5 occupied? Freeway 5 occupied only at T=78, not at T=79, so safe.\n\nAction a_79: if U, y_80=6\n\nT=80: position y=6, now at T=80, is freeway 6 occupied? Freeway 6 occupied only at T=78, not at T=80, so safe.\n\nBut freeway 6: we said occupied only at T=78, yes.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at T=80 should be safe.\n\nBut we need to go to y=7,8,9.\n\nT=80: y=6, if U, y_81=7\n\nT=81: y=7, is it occupied? Freeway 7 occupied only at T=78, not 81, safe.\n\nAction U, y_82=8\n\nT=82: y=8, freeway 8 occupied only at T=78, not 82, safe.\n\nAction U, y_83=9\n\nT=83: y=9, goal reached.\n\nNow, check if any collision.\n\nIn this sequence, from T=78 to T=83:\n\nT=78: y=4, safe\n\nT=79: y=5, safe (not occ)\n\nT=80: y=6, safe (not occ)\n\nT=81: y=7, safe (not occ)\n\nT=82: y=8, safe (not occ)\n\nT=83: y=9, safe\n\nBut we started from T=75, and we have to get to y=4 at T=78.\n\nNow, from T=75 to T=78.\n\nT=75: y=5, need to set y_78=4.\n\nSo y_78 = y_75 + Δy_75 + Δy_76 + Δy_77 =4\n\n5 + sum Δy =4, so sum Δy = -1\n\nSo over three actions, decrease by 1.\n\nFor example, do S, S, D or D, S, S or S, D, S.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that at each turn, position is safe.\n\nT=75: y=5, safe\n\nAction a_75: suppose S, then y_76 =5 +0 =5\n\nT=76: y=5, now at T=76, is y=5 occupied? Only at T=78, not at T=76, so safe.\n\nAction a_76: suppose S, y_77=5\n\nT=77: y=5, at T=77, safe? Not occupied.\n\nAction a_77: D, then y_78=5-1=4\n\nT=78: y=4, safe.\n\nThen proceed as above.\n\nIn the above to T=83, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns? We need the sequence of actions until reaching y=9.\n\nAt T=83, y=9, so we reached at turn T=83.\n\nNumber of actions from t_start to t_start + H-1.\n\nStart turn t_1=75.\n\nAfter H turns, position at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T, after H-1 actions? Better to think of the turn when we are at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 75: position y=5\n\nAction a_75\n\nThen turn 76: position y_76\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 75+k, position y_{75+k}\n\nSet y_{75+k} =9 for some k.\n\nMinimal k.\n\nIn above, at T=83, y=9, T=83 = 75 + 8, so k=8, since from T=75 to T=83 is 8 turns later? T=75 is turn 1, T=76 turn 2, ..., T=83 is turn 9? Let's index.\n\nStart: turn 75: y=5\n\nAfter action a_75, position at turn 76 is y_76\n\nGenerally, at turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action at T, position for T+1 is set.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn T.\n\nFor T=79, y=9? How?\n\nFrom y=5 at T=75, to y=9 at T=79, need to increase by 4 in 4 actions: actions at T=75,76,77,78 to set y_79.\n\ny_79 = y_75 + Δy_75 + Δy_76 + Δy_77 + Δy_78\n\nSet to 9, so 5 + sum_{t=75 to 78} Δy_t =9, so sum Δy =4, so need four U, no S or D.\n\nBut at T=78, if we are at y=8 or something.\n\nBut at T=78, we must not be on y=5-8, but if we go directly, at T=78 we might be on y=8 if we did three U from T=75.\n\nT=75: y=5, U: y_76=6\n\nT=76: y=6, U: y_77=7\n\nT=77: y=7, U: y_78=8\n\nBut at T=78, y=8, occupied, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf we delay, but to reach at T=79, we need to be at y=9 at T=79.\n\nTo have y_79=9, we must have y_78 such that after action, y_79=9, so if a_78=U, y_78=8.\n\nBut at T=78, y=8 occupied, collision.\n\nIf a_78=S, y_79=y_78, not 9 unless y_78=9, but then a_78=S, y_79=9, but y_78 must be 9, but from y=5, hard to reach y=9 by T=78.\n\ny_78 <=8 as before, cannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=9 at T=79, we need y_78=8 or 9 with S, but y_78<=8, and if y_78=8, at T=78 collision if we are on it.\n\nIf we are not on y=8 at T=78, but to have y_79=9, we need to be on y=8 at T=78 and move up, but collision at T=78.\n\nCannot reach at T=79 because T=78 is blocked.\n\nSimilarly, T=80: to be at y=9 at T=80, need y_79=8 or 9 with action.\n\nBut y_79 depends on previous.\n\nFirst, avoid T=78 issue.\n\nIn my earlier plan, I had to go down to y=4 at T=78 to avoid, then reach at T=83.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nPerhaps stay on y=5 until after T=78, but at T=78 y=5 occupied, so cannot be on y=5 at T=78.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y=5,6,7,8 at T=78.\n\nSo must be on y<=4 or y=9 at T=78, but y=9 impossible at T=78.\n\nSo must be on y=2,3,4 at T=78.\n\nNow, from there, go to y=9.\n\nBut y=4 is occupied at T=80,81,82, so if we go through y=4, we need to not be on it at those times.\n\nIn my earlier sequence: at T=78 y=4, then T=79 y=5, T=80 y=6, etc., so at T=80, y=6, not on y=4, so safe.\n\nBut we can reach faster.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at T=80.\n\nHow?\n\ny_80 =9.\n\ny_80 = y_75 + Δy_75 + Δy_76 + Δy_77 + Δy_78 + Δy_79? Let's see.\n\nPosition at T=80 is after actions from T=75 to T=79? \n\ny_80 = y_75 + sum_{t=75 to 79} Δy_t\n\nBecause y_76 = y_75 + Δy_75\n\ny_77 = y_76 + Δy_76 = y_75 + Δy_75 + Δy_76\n\n...\n\ny_80 = y_75 + Δy_75 + Δy_76 + Δy_77 + Δy_78 + Δy_79\n\nSet y_80=9, so 5 + sum_{t=75 to 79} Δy_t =9, so sum of 5 Δy =4.\n\nSo need four U and one S in five actions, for example.\n\nBut we have to consider the path and collisions.\n\nMoreover, at T=78, we must have y_78 <=4.\n\nNow, let's list the turns: T=75,76,77,78,79.\n\ny_78 must be <=4.\n\ny_80=9.\n\nSince sum Δy from t=75 to 79 is 4, and y_78 <=4.\n\ny_78 = y_75 + Δy_75 + Δy_76 + Δy_77 = 5 + sum_{75 to 77} Δy <=4, so sum_{75 to 77} Δy <= -1\n\nThen y_80 = y_78 + Δy_78 + Δy_79\n\nSet y_80=9, so since y_78 <=4, we need Δy_78 + Δy_79 >=5, but each Δy <=1, so impossible, max increase 2, to y_78 +2 <=6 <9.\n\nContradiction.\n\ny_78 <=4, then y_79 <= y_78 +1 <=5, y_80 <= y_79 +1 <=6, which is less than 9, so impossible to reach y=9 by T=80.\n\nSimilarly, T=81: y_81=9.\n\ny_81 = y_75 + sum_{t=75 to 80} Δy_t =5 + 6 terms sum =9, so sum=4.\n\ny_78 <=4.\n\ny_81 = y_78 + Δy_78 + Δy_79 + Δy_80\n\ny_78 <=4, so max y_81 =4 +1+1+1=7 <9, cannot reach 9.\n\nT=82: y_82=9.\n\ny_82 = y_75 + sum_{75 to 81} Δy_t =5 + 7 terms sum =9, so sum=4.\n\ny_78 <=4.\n\ny_82 = y_78 + Δy_78 + ... + Δy_81\n\n4 terms, max increase 4, to 8<9, cannot reach 9.\n\ny_82 <= y_78 +4 <=4+4=8<9.\n\nT=83: y_83=9.\n\ny_83 = y_75 + sum_{75 to 82} Δy_t =5 + 8 terms sum =9, so sum=4.\n\ny_78 <=4.\n\ny_83 = y_78 + Δy_78 + ... + Δy_82\n\n5 terms, max increase 5, to 4+5=9, possible if y_78=4 and all U after.\n\nAs in my initial plan.\n\nNow, earlier at T=83, y=9.\n\nBut in that plan, we had y_78=4, then y_79=5, y_80=6, y_81=7, y_82=8, y_83=9.\n\nAll safe as checked.\n\nBut we need to confirm the actions to get to y_78=4.\n\nWith y_75=5.\n\nTo have y_78=4, need sum_{t=75,76,77} Δy_t = -1.\n\nFor example, actions: S at 75, S at 76, D at 77.\n\nThen:\n\nT=75: y=5, action S, y_76=5\n\nT=76: y=5, action S, y_77=5\n\nT=77: y=5, action D, y_78=4\n\nThen T=78: y=4, action U, y_79=5\n\nT=79: y=5, action U, y_80=6\n\nT=80: y=6, action U, y_81=7\n\nT=81: y=7, action U, y_82=8\n\nT=82: y=8, action U, y_83=9\n\nT=83: y=9, done.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nT=75: y=5, not occupied, safe\n\nT=76: y=5, not occupied (only T=78), safe\n\nT=77: y=5, not occupied, safe\n\nT=78: y=4, not occupied (freeway4 occ at 80-82, not 78), safe\n\nT=79: y=5, not occupied (only T=78), safe\n\nT=80: y=6, not occupied (only T=78), safe\n\nT=81: y=7, not occupied, safe\n\nT=82: y=8, not occupied, safe\n\nT=83: y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nH is the number of turns from start until we reach, but in terms of the sequence.\n\nWe reach at turn T=83, which is turn number 83.\n\nStarted at turn 75, so turns from 75 to 83, that's 9 turns: 75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83.\n\nBut at turn 75, we are at start, then after actions, we reach goal at turn 83.\n\nThe minimal H such that at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at (0,9).\n\nt_1 =75, at turn 75 + H -1, position y=9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 83, y=9, so 75 + H -1 =83, so 74 + H =83, H=9.\n\nH is the number of actions? The sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1.\n\nThe action sequence is for turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to the turn before we reach, but since we reach at turn H, we take actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1? Let's see the answer format.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9)\" means at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, so for t from 0 to H-1, action at turn t_1 + t.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is after last action.\n\nStandard: at turn T, position y_T, take action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nAfter action a_T, position for next turn is set.\n\nWe are at (0,9) when for some turn, y_T =9.\n\nIn the context, at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9), meaning after H-1 actions from start.\n\nStart at turn t_1, position given.\n\nAfter first action a_{t_1}, position at turn t_1 +1 is updated.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, position at turn t_1 + k.\n\nSet position at turn t_1 + k to (0,9).\n\nThen H-1 = k, so k = H-1, number of actions is H.\n\nIn the notation, H is the number of turns, meaning the number of actions taken.\n\nSequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nAfter these H actions, position at turn t_1 + H should be (0,9)? Not necessarily.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that at turn t_1 + H -1, the position is (0,9)\"\n\nFrom the text: \"to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nIn the problem: \"reach (0,9)\", and in the context, at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nAlso, in answer format, it shows Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to some turn.\n\nIn the sequence, after the last action, position should be (0,9) at that turn.\n\nFor example, in my sequence, at turn 83, y=9, which is t_1 + 8, since 75+8=83.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =83, 75 + H -1 =83, so 74 + H=83, H=9.\n\nH=9 turns.\n\nSequence of 9 actions: from t=0 to 8, actions at turns 75 to 83? t from 0 to H-1=8, so turns 75 to 83, but actions at turn T affect the next position.\n\nIn the sequence, we list actions for each turn starting from t_1.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nAt turn 75: action S, then position at 76 is 5\n\nBut we list the action for the turn.\n\nIn the path, to have position at turn 83 be 9.\n\nActions: turn 75: S (so y76=5)\n\nTurn 76: S (y77=5)\n\nTurn 77: D (y78=4)\n\nTurn 78: U (y79=5)\n\nTurn 79: U (y80=6)\n\nTurn 80: U (y81=7)\n\nTurn 81: U (y82=8)\n\nTurn 82: U (y83=9)\n\nAt turn 83, position y=9, so we reached at turn 83.\n\nThe actions are from turn 75 to 82, that's 8 actions? Turns: 75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82: that's 8 turns.\n\nt from 0 to 7 for H=8? Let's see.\n\nStarted at turn 75, after 0 actions, position at 75.\n\nAfter first action at 75, position at 76.\n\n...\n\nAfter action at 82, position at 83.\n\nSo to be at position (0,9) at turn T, we take actions up to turn T-1.\n\nIn this case, at turn 83, position is 9, so we took actions from turn 75 to 82.\n\nThat's 8 actions: for t_1 to t_1 +7.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =83, 75 + H -1 =83, H-1=8, H=9? Inconsistency.\n\nDefine: let the turn index.\n\nAt turn t_1, position given.\n\nWe take actions at turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to some turn.\n\nAfter action at turn T, position at turn T+1 is set.\n\nWe want position at some turn T_final to be (0,9).\n\nT_final = t_1 + H -1 for some H.\n\nAnd we take actions from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H - 2? Let's think.\n\nFor example, start turn t_1, no action yet, position at t_1.\n\nTake action a_{t_1}, then position at t_1 +1.\n\nTake action a_{t_1+1}, position at t_1+2.\n\n...\n\nTake action a_{t_1 + k-1}, position at t_1 + k.\n\nSet position at t_1 + k to (0,9).\n\nThen the actions are from t_1 to t_1 + k -1, number of actions: k.\n\nThen H is such that t_1 + H -1 = t_1 + k, so H-1 = k, H = k+1.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to H-1, actions at t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen after these actions, position at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be (0,9).\n\nThere is a mismatch.\n\nFrom the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"after collisions with cars... at turn T only if... for freeway y_T\"\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9), so y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe actions are taken at turns t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, which are turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nEach action a_{T} affects y_{T+1}.\n\nSo for turn T, action a_T determines Δy for y_{T+1}.\n\nThe position at turn S is y_S.\n\nFor turn S, y_S is given for S=t_1, or computed from previous.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1 will determine positions from y_{t_1} to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, with t_1=75, we want y_{75 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn my case, y_83=9, so 75 + H -1 =83, so 74 + H=83, H=9.\n\nThen actions for t from 0 to 8, turns 75 to 83? t=0 to H-1=8, turns t_1 + t for t=0 to 8, so turns 75 to 83.\n\nBut action at turn T determines y_{T+1}, so for turn 83, action a_83 would determine y_84, but we don't care since we reached at turn 83.\n\nIn the sequence, we list actions up to the turn where after that we are at goal, but since position at turn t_1 + H -1 is the goal, and we take actions at turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1, but the last action at t_1 + H -1 determines y_{t_1 + H}, not y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nConfusion.\n\nPosition at turn K is y_K.\n\ny_K is determined by actions before.\n\nSpecifically, y_{t_1} is given.\n\nThen for K > t_1, y_K = y_{t_1} + sum_{t=t_1}^{K-1} Δy_t\n\nWe want y_M =9 for M = t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen actions from t=t_1 to t=M-1, that is t=t_1 to t= (t_1 + H -1) -1 = t_1 + H -2.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=t_1 to t_1 + H -2, that's (H-1) actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, it is indexed as {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, which would be actions at t_1 to t_1 + H -1, which is H actions.\n\nBut for y_M with M= t_1 + H -1, we need actions up to t=M-1 = t_1 + H -2.\n\nSo the actions should be from t_1 to t_1 + H -2, for t=0 to H-2? I think there's an off-by-one.\n\nPerhaps in the context, the action at turn T is part of the turn, and position at T is before action, but after previous.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's follow the answer format.\n\nIn the format, it shows \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\", \"Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\", etc., and after these actions, position at some turn is (0,9).\n\nIn my sequence, we have actions at turn 75 to 82 to reach position at 83.\n\nSo turns: Turn 75: S, Turn 76: S, Turn 77: D, Turn 78: U, Turn 79: U, Turn 80: U, Turn 81: U, Turn 82: U\n\nThen position at turn 83 is (0,9).\n\nNow, the last action is at turn 82, and we reach at turn 83.\n\nM = t_1 + H -1 =83.\n\nt_1=75, so 75 + H -1 =83, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nThen the sequence should have H=9 actions? But I have 8 actions: from 75 to 82.\n\nNumber of actions: 8.\n\nH should be the number of turns, meaning the number of actions in the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, with H actions.\n\nFor t from 0 to H-1, actions at t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen position at turn t_1 + H -1 is after actions up to t_1 + H -2, so it depends on actions before t_1 + H -1.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, it must be that the action at t_1 + H -1 is not needed for that position, but the position at t_1 + H -1 is determined by actions up to t_1 + H -2.\n\nThe action at t_1 + H -1 would affect y_{t_1 + H}, not y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nSo for y_M with M= t_1 + H -1 to be 9, we need actions from t_1 to M-1 = t_1 + H -2.\n\nSo the actions in the sequence should be from t_1 to t_1 + H -2, for t=0 to H-2.\n\nBut the problem says t=0 to H-1.\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding.\n\nPerhaps for turn M, position y_M is set, and action a_M is taken, but collision is based on y_M at that turn.\n\nThen after a_M, y_{M+1} is set.\n\nTo reach at turn M, we need y_M=9, and we take actions up to a_M, but a_M doesn't affect y_M.\n\nIn the sequence, when we list action for turn T, it is for that turn, and position at T is before or after? The collision is checked at turn T based on y_T.\n\nThen action a_T is taken, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nFor the goal, we want at some turn, y_T=9, and we stop.\n\nIn the action sequence, we list actions from t_1 to T-1 to reach y_T=9.\n\nBut in the format, it includes the action for the turn when we reach? No.\n\nLet's assume that for the turn when we are at (0,9), we don't take an action, or we do, but since we reached, we can stop.\n\nBut in the sequence, we list actions until the turn before or including.\n\nI think for simplicity, in this context, since we reach at turn 83, and we took actions up to turn 82, we list actions from turn 75 to 82.\n\nNumber of actions: 8.\n\nThen H=8, and t_1 + H -1 =75 +8 -1=82, but at turn 82, y=8, not 9.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn my case, at turn 83, position is (0,9), so t_1 + H -1 =83, 75 + H -1=83, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nThen the sequence should have actions for t=0 to 8, turns 75 to 83.\n\nBut for turn 83, if we list an action, it would determine y_84, but we don't need to go further.\n\nPerhaps for the turn when we reach, we don't take action, or we take a dummy action, but in the sequence, we include it.\n\nTo resolve, in the sequence, when we list action for turn T, it is for that turn, and after all actions, position at the last turn or next.\n\nI think it's better to look for a sequence where at the turn of the last action, position is 9, but that might require staying or something.\n\nFor example, if at some turn we are at y=9, we can have action S, but we might list it.\n\nIn my sequence, at turn 82, we are at y=8, action U, to y=9 at turn 83.\n\nBut at turn 83, we are at y=9, so for turn 83, we don't take action, or we can consider the action sequence up to turn 82.\n\nBut in the format, for H=9, it would include action at turn 83.\n\nTo avoid, perhaps we can reach at turn 82 with y=9.\n\nIs it possible earlier?\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at turn 82.\n\ny_82=9.\n\nFrom y_75=5, need to increase by 4 in 7 actions? y_82 = y_75 + sum_{t=75 to 81} Δy_t =5 + 7 terms sum =9, so sum=4.\n\nWith y_78 <=4.\n\ny_82 = y_78 + Δy_78 + Δy_79 + Δy_80 + Δy_81\n\ny_78 <=4, max 4+4=8<9, cannot reach 9 by turn 82.\n\nSimilarly, turn 83 is the earliest possible, as before.\n\nSo we must reach at turn 83.\n\nFor the sequence, we need to list actions from turn 75 to 82, and position at turn 83 is 9.\n\nFor the action at turn 83, it is not needed, but in the sequence for H=9, it would include a_{83}, which we can set to S or something, but since we reached, it might be redundant.\n\nBut in the collision, at turn 83, if we are on y=9, no car, safe, and we can do action S, but it doesn't matter.\n\nSo for the sequence, with H=9, actions from turn 75 to 83.\n\nBut at turn 83, we are already at y=9, so action a_{83} can be S.\n\nThen position at turn 84 is still 9, but we don't care.\n\nIn terms of reaching, at turn 83 we are at 9.\n\nSo for the answer, we can include the action at turn 83 as S.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence.\n\nTo be consistent with the format.\n\nIn this case, for my sequence:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 75: S\n\nTurn 76: S\n\nTurn 77: D\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nThen at turn 83, y=9.\n\nNow for H=9, we need actions up to t=8, turn 83.\n\nSo for turn 83, action a_{83}, we can set to S, since we are at y=9, stay.\n\nThen position at turn 84 is 9, but we reached at 83.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 75: S\n\nTurn 76: S\n\nTurn 77: D\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: S\n\nBut at turn 83, we are at y=9, action S, no issue.\n\nAnd we reached at turn 83.\n\nH=9.\n\nBut we can omit the last S, but since the format requires H actions from t=0 to H-1, we include it.\n\nNow, is there a shorter sequence? H=9, but minimal H.\n\nEarlier we saw that reaching before turn 83 is impossible due to the T=78 blockage and the need to go down.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=3 or something at T=78, but then it takes more turns to go up.\n\nFor example, if y_78=3, then to y=9, need 6 up moves, so reach at turn 84 or later, worse.\n\nSimilarly, y_78=4 is better.\n\nWe could go up earlier but avoid being on occupied rows at critical times.\n\nFor example, at T=78, be on y=4.\n\nBut y=4 is safe at T=78.\n\nThen from there, go up, but y=4 occupied at T=80,81,82.\n\nIn my sequence, at T=80, we are at y=6, not on y=4, so fine.\n\nBut at T=80, y=6 is safe.\n\nIs there a way to reach earlier?\n\nSuppose at T=77, we are at y=6 or something.\n\nBut at T=78, we need y<=4.\n\nSo at T=77, if y=6, then to have y_78<=4, need Δy_77 <= -2, but Δy >= -1, impossible. So y_77 must be <=5 to have y_78<=4 with D.\n\ny_77 <=5, and y_78 = y_77 + Δy_77 <=4.\n\nIf y_77=5, Δy_77 <= -1, e.g. D\n\nIf y_77=4, Δy_77 <=0, S or D\n\nEtc.\n\nBut in all cases, we need to decrease or stay low before T=78.\n\nThen after T=78, go up.\n\nBut from y_78=4 to y_83=9, 5 steps, as before.\n\nIf we can be at higher y after T=78, but y_78<=4.\n\nSo minimal is at turn 83.\n\nPerhaps we can reach on turn 83 with different actions, but H=9 same.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=4 earlier, but that might not help.\n\nFor example, at T=75, instead of S, go D to y=4 at T=76.\n\nThen at T=76, y=4.\n\nBut y=4 is safe at T=76, not occupied.\n\nThen at T=77, if we go S, y=4, or U to y=5.\n\nBut at T=78, we need to not be on 5-8, so if at T=77 y=5, then at T=78 must go down or stay, but y=5 occupied, cannot.\n\nSo better to stay at y=4 or below at T=78.\n\nIn this case, if we go to y=4 at T=76, then at T=77, we can stay or go down, but going down is worse.\n\nThen at T=78, y=4, same as before.\n\nThen same sequence from there.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo H=9 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have two S at start, but we could do other combinations.\n\nFor example, to get sum Δy = -1 from T=75 to 77.\n\nWe can do D at 75, then S at 76, S at 77, etc.\n\nBut need to check safety.\n\nAt T=75: if D, y_76=4\n\nThen T=76: y=4, which is safe? At T=76, freeway 4 occupied only at T=80,81,82, not 76, so safe.\n\nAction: if S, y_77=4\n\nT=77: y=4, safe, action S, y_78=4\n\nThen same as before.\n\nOr action U at T=76: y_77=5\n\nThen T=77: y=5, safe, but then to have y_78<=4, must do D, y_78=4.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut in this case, with D at 75: then actions:\n\nTurn 75: D (y76=4)\n\nTurn 76: S (y77=4) or U to 5 then D, but longer.\n\nBetter to stay.\n\nTurn 76: S (y77=4)\n\nTurn 77: S (y78=4)  // but y77=4, action S, y78=4\n\nThen same up.\n\nBut at turn 77, if we do S, y78=4.\n\nBut we can do nothing different.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, either way.\n\nNow, back to the cars, I think I missed something.\n\nFreeway 4 has multiple cars, but I considered only the first one, but the second and third don't affect x=0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut in freeway 4, at T=80,81,82, occupied, but in the path, we are not on y=4 at those times.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=80, we are at y=6, etc.\n\nNow, another thing: the player position when moving.\n\nThe note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nWhich we already considered, since collision only based on current y_T.\n\nSo I think the sequence is fine.\n\nTo write the answer.\n\nMinimal H=9.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 75: S\n\nTurn 76: S\n\nTurn 77: D\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: S  // since we need to include action for turn 83\n\nBut at turn 83, position is y=9, we can do S.\n\nIn the sequence, with t from 0 to 8.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can have a shorter H, but we cannot.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 at turn 83 with fewer actions if we go up faster, but due to T=78 constraint, we have to waste one action to decrease.\n\nIn the sum, from T=75 to 82, we have 8 actions, but to reach y=9 from y=5, min 4 up, but we have one down, so net +3, to y=8 at T=83? In my sequence, with actions: S,S,D,U,U,U,U,U\n\nΔy: 0,0,-1,+1,+1,+1,+1,+1\n\nCumulative: start y75=5\n\nAfter a75 S: y76=5\n\na76 S: y77=5\n\na77 D: y78=4\n\na78 U: y79=5\n\na79 U: y80=6\n\na80 U: y81=7\n\na81 U: y82=8\n\na82 U: y83=9\n\na83 S: y84=9, but not needed.\n\nNumber of actions to reach: from turn 75 to 82, 8 actions to reach at turn 83.\n\nBut with H=9, we include a83.\n\nSince we reached at turn 83, and for the sequence, it should be fine.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to specify the actions.\n\nIn the beginning, I used S and D, but we could use different, but this works.\n\nTo make it with less stay, but not necessary.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose at T=75: D, then y76=4\n\nT=76: U, y77=5? But then at T=77 y=5, then to y78, must decrease to avoid.\n\nT=77: D, y78=4\n\nThen same.\n\nBut more actions: D,U,D instead of S,S,D.\n\nWorse in terms of net, but same number of turns to reach.\n\nIn this case, with D at 75: y76=4\n\nThen if at T=76: U, y77=5\n\nT=77: D, y78=4\n\nThen T=78: U, y79=5, etc., same as before but with extra moves.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo the first sequence is fine.\n\nNow, about the cars, I think I covered all.\n\nBut let's double-check freeway 4 at T=80,81,82.\n\nIn the sequence, we are not on y=4 at those times, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\ny=1,2,3 occupied at T=84-87, but we reach before, at T=83, so no issue.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=9.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 75: S\n\nTurn 76: S\n\nTurn 77: D\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: S\n\nBut in the answer format, for turn 83, since we are at y=9, action S is fine.\n\nTo save an action, but we need H=9.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence where at turn 82 we are at y=9, but impossible as before.\n\nSo this should be it.\n\nNow, write the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 75\\) is 9. This sequence avoids collisions with all cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) based on the given car states and update rules.\n\nThe action sequence is designed to:\n- Avoid being on freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) at turn \\(78\\) (when all are occupied).\n- Avoid being on freeway \\(y = 4\\) at turns \\(80, 81, 82\\) (when occupied).\n- Reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible after navigating around the occupied times.\n\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{75 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{8}\\) (for \\(H=9\\)) is:\n\n- At turn \\(75\\), action \\(S\\) (stay): Player remains at \\(y = 5\\). Freeway \\(y = 5\\) is not occupied at turn \\(75\\), so safe.\n- At turn \\(76\\), action \\(S\\) (stay): Player remains at \\(y = 5\\). Freeway \\(y = 5\\) is not occupied at turn \\(76\\), so safe.\n- At turn \\(77\\), action \\(D\\) (down): Player moves to \\(y = 4\\). Freeway \\(y = 5\\) is not occupied at turn \\(77\\), so safe before moving.\n- At turn \\(78\\), action \\(U\\) (up): Player moves to \\(y = 5\\). Freeway \\(y = 4\\) is not occupied at turn \\(78\\), so safe before moving.\n- At turn \\(79\\), action \\(U\\) (up): Player moves to \\(y = 6\\). Freeway \\(y = 5\\) is not occupied at turn \\(79\\), so safe before moving.\n- At turn \\(80\\), action \\(U\\) (up): Player moves to \\(y = 7\\). Freeway \\(y = 6\\) is not occupied at turn \\(80\\), so safe before moving.\n- At turn \\(81\\), action \\(U\\) (up): Player moves to \\(y = 8\\).

Freeway \\(y = 8\\) is not occupied at turn \\(82\\), so safe before moving.\n- At turn \\(83\\), action \\(S\\) (stay): Player remains at \\(y = 9\\), having reached the goal. Position \\((0, 9)\\) is safe as no cars exist at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nAt turn \\(83\\) (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 75 + 9 - 1 = 83\\)), the position is \\((0, 9)\\), satisfying the goal.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. Each turn, I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but I have to stay within y=0 to 9.\n\nThe cars are on each freeway from 1 to 8, and they move left or right at constant speeds. A collision happens if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. Importantly, when I move to a new y-position, I'm not on that new freeway until the next turn. So, if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and I arrive at y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t_1 = 78. So I start at turn 78, position y=0.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9 at some turn, say t_1 + H - 1, meaning after H actions, I'm at y=9. Since I start at turn t_1, after 0 actions I'm at y=0. After one action at turn t_1, I might move to y=1 or stay or down, but since y=0 is the bottom, I can't go down, so only U or S.\n\ny=0, so from y=0, if I do D, I might go to -1, but y must be in [0,9], so I think it's clipped or invalid? The player update says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]. So probably, if I try to go below 0 or above 9, it stays at 0 or 9.\n\nBut in this case, from y=0, D would try to go to -1, but it should stay at 0. Similarly, at y=9, U would stay at 9. So actions are possible but might not change position.\n\nNow, for cars, each car has a head, tail, direction, speed. The span is given for turn t_1=78.\n\nFor left-moving cars, span moves left, so head and tail decrease. For right-moving, head and tail increase.\n\nCollision when I'm on freeway k at turn T, and 0 is in the span of some car on k at T.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at turn 78, and y=0 has no cars, I think? The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars. Similarly, y=9 is the goal, no cars.\n\nSo at turn 78, I'm on y=0, which has no cars, so no collision.\n\nI need to move up to y=9.\n\nBut I have to avoid the cars on y=1 to 8.\n\nNow, the cars move, so I need to find when it's safe to be on each freeway.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions over time.\n\nSince the cars move linearly, I can find for each freeway k, for each turn T, whether there is a car where 0 is in its span.\n\nThat is, for a car on freeway k, at turn T, if there is a car such that min(span) ≤ 0 ≤ max(span).\n\nFor left-moving cars, span is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)], but since it's moving left, head and tail, with h > τ or something? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nHere it says [h, τ] for left-moving, but in the example, for freeway 4, there is (-48,-59,right,4), which seems inconsistent.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nIn the car state table:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nBut it says direction right, but the numbers: head h=-48, tail τ=-59.\n\nIf direction is right, and it's moving right, then for right-moving, it says: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the text: \"Right-moving: [Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nBut in the table, for freeway 1, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s) = (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nSo for direction right, Span(t_1) should be [τ, h] = [-59, -48] because τ is tail, h is head, and for right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so span is from τ to h, with τ < h.\n\nBut in the input, it's given as (h, τ, d, s) = (-48, -59, right, 3), and since -48 > -59, so h = -48, τ = -59, so τ < h, so for right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn freeway 4, there are multiple cars: (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4)\n\nFor (24,13,right,4): h=24, τ=13, but 24 > 13, so τ=13, h=24, so span [13,24] at t_1.\n\nSimilarly, (-12,-23,right,4): h=-12, τ=-23, τ=-23 < h=-12, span [-23,-12]\n\nAnd (-48,-59,right,4): span [-59,-48]\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\n(0,-11,right,12): h=0, τ=-11, τ=-11 < h=0, span [-11,0] at t_1.\n\nh=0, τ=-11, so at t_1, the car covers from -11 to 0.\n\nAnd since it's right-moving, at turn T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-11 + 12(T-t_1), 0 + 12(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, for collision: at turn T, if I am on freeway k, and for some car on k, 0 is in [min(span), max(span)] at T.\n\nFor a car, min and max depend on direction.\n\nFor right-moving car, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)], with τ < h, so min is τ + s(T-t_1), max is h + s(T-t_1)\n\nFor left-moving, but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving, from the table.\n\nLet me check:\n\nFreeway 1: right\n\n2: right\n\n3: right\n\n4: all right\n\n5: right\n\n6: right\n\n7: right\n\n8: right\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so no left-moving cars. That simplifies things.\n\nAll cars moving right with various speeds.\n\nNow, for each freeway k, I need to find for which turns T, 0 is occupied by a car, meaning 0 is in the span of some car on k at T.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need to see if any car covers 0 at T.\n\nt_1 = 78.\n\nLet Δt = T - t_1, so for time offset from current.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, with given (h, τ, d, s), but since all d=right, we can ignore d.\n\nFor each car, the span at time Δt is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt], since right-moving.\n\n0 is covered if min ≤ 0 ≤ max, i.e., τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nSince τ < h, we have τ + s Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s Δt, which is equivalent to:\n\nτ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nNow, solve for Δt:\n\nFirst, τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ s Δt ≤ -τ ⇒ Δt ≤ -τ / s\n\nSince s > 0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ h + s Δt ⇒ s Δt ≥ -h ⇒ Δt ≥ -h / s\n\nSo Δt must satisfy: ceil( -h / s ) ≤ Δt ≤ floor( -τ / s )\n\nSince Δt integer.\n\nLet me define for each car, the interval of Δt where it covers 0.\n\nBut 0 is covered when τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nWhich is max( ceil( (-h)/s ) , something ) but let's think carefully.\n\nFrom τ + s Δt ≤ 0, so Δt ≤ floor( -τ / s )? Let's see.\n\nτ + s Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ s Δt ≤ -τ ⇒ Δt ≤ floor( -τ / s ) only if -τ/s not integer, but better to use inequalities.\n\nSince Δt integer, 0 is covered if there exists integer Δt such that:\n\nτ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nWhich implies:\n\nlower bound: Δt ≥ ceil( (-h) / s ) because from 0 ≤ h + s Δt, so s Δt ≥ -h, Δt ≥ ceil(-h/s)\n\nupper bound: from τ + s Δt ≤ 0, s Δt ≤ -τ, so Δt ≤ floor(-τ/s)\n\nThen, for 0 to be covered, we need ceil(-h/s) ≤ Δt ≤ floor(-τ/s)\n\nAnd since τ < h, -τ > -h, so ceil(-h/s) ≤ floor(-τ/s) is possible.\n\nThen for that car, it covers 0 for Δt from ceil(-h/s) to floor(-τ/s) inclusive.\n\nNow, for each freeway, multiple cars, so 0 is occupied at Δt if any car covers it.\n\nOtherwise, free.\n\nNow, I need to find for each freeway k, the set of Δt where it is occupied.\n\nThen, when I move, I can be on a freeway only when it is free at that turn.\n\nNow, my position: I start at y=0 at Δt=0 (turn t_1).\n\nAfter each action, I move to a new y at the next turn.\n\nLet me define the turn index.\n\nAt turn T = t_1 + τ, where τ = 0,1,2,... but τ is used for tail, so let me use u for time offset.\n\nSet u = T - t_1, so u=0 is current turn.\n\nAt u=0, I am at y=0.\n\nAfter action at u, I move to y_{u+1} at turn u+1.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t_1 + u, I am at position y_u.\n\nThen I take action a_{t_1 + u}, which determines Δy, so y_{u+1} = y_u + Δy.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + u + 1, I am at y_{u+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t_1 + u if I am on freeway y_u (which is between 1 and 8), and it is occupied at that turn.\n\nThe action a_t is taken at turn t, and affects position at t+1.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t, I choose a_t, then position at t+1 is set.\n\nBut collision is checked at turn t when position is y_t.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, if y_t between 1 and 8, and occupied, collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nThen I choose action a_t, which will move me to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nFor the sequence, I need to specify actions from t_1 onwards, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, I am at y=9.\n\nLet's see the answer format.\n\nIt says: sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and at turn t_1 + H - 1, position is 9.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"at turn t_1 + H - 1, position is 9.\"\n\nAlso, in the box, it should be Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, etc.\n\nNow, at turn t_1, I start at position (0,0), which is safe.\n\nThen I take action a_{t_1}, which will move me to y_{t_1 +1} at turn t_1+1.\n\nBut at turn t_1, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nThen after action, at turn t_1+1, I am at new y, and if y between 1-8, check collision at that turn.\n\nSimilarly for subsequent turns.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, say at turn T, y_T =9.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, it's always safe.\n\nThe turn when I first reach y=9, that should be the end.\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, I am at position after H actions.\n\nStart: turn t_1, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1} at turn t_1, position at turn t_1+1 is y1.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1+1} at turn t_1+1, position at turn t_1+2 is y2, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, position at turn t_1 + k.\n\nI reach (0,9) when for some k, y_k =9 at turn t_1 + k.\n\nThen H is the number of actions to first achieve that, so at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nThen the sequence is actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so t from 0 to H-1 in the index.\n\nActions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and position at t_1 + H is 9.\n\nNow, H is the number of turns from start to end, including the start? No.\n\nAt turn t_1, position 0.\n\nAfter 0 actions, position 0.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn t_1+1, position y1.\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_H.\n\nSet y_H =9.\n\nSo from y=0 to y=9, I need to increase y by 9, so minimum H if I go up every time, H=9 actions, but I might have to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be larger.\n\nBut with cars, I might need to take more turns.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I need to go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when it is occupied.\n\nt_1 =78.\n\nSet u = T - t_1, so u=0,1,2,... is turn offset.\n\nFor each freeway k=1 to 8, find for which u, the freeway is occupied, i.e., 0 is covered by some car on k at u.\n\nSince cars move, u is the time offset.\n\nNow, list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (h, τ, d, s) = (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nFor this car, span at u: min = τ + s u = -59 + 3u, max = h + s u = -48 + 3u\n\n0 covered if min <= 0 <= max, i.e., -59 + 3u <= 0 <= -48 + 3u\n\nSo -59 + 3u <= 0 => 3u <= 59 => u <= 59/3 = 19.666, so u <= 19\n\n0 <= -48 + 3u => 3u >= 48 => u >= 16\n\nSo u from 16 to 19 inclusive.\n\nThus for freeway 1, occupied at u=16,17,18,19.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-48,-59,right,3), so same, occupied u=16 to 19.\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-48,-59,right,3), occupied u=16 to 19.\n\nNow freeway 4 has three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4)\n\nMin = τ + s u = -59 + 4u, max = h + s u = -48 + 4u\n\n0 covered: -59 + 4u <= 0 <= -48 + 4u\n\n-59 + 4u <=0 => 4u <=59 => u <= 14.75, u<=14\n\n0 <= -48 +4u => 4u >=48 => u>=12\n\nSo u=12,13,14\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,4)\n\nMin = τ + s u = -23 + 4u, max = h + s u = -12 + 4u\n\n0 covered: -23 +4u <=0 <= -12 +4u\n\n-23+4u<=0 => 4u<=23 => u<=5.75, u<=5\n\n0<= -12+4u => 4u>=12 => u>=3\n\nSo u=3,4,5\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,4) h=24, τ=13, so min=13 +4u, max=24+4u\n\n0 covered: 13+4u <=0 <=24+4u\n\nBut 13+4u <=0? 13+4u >=13>0 for u>=0, so 13+4u <=0 impossible. Similarly, min=13+4u >0 for all u>=0, so 0 never covered by this car.\n\nSo for freeway 4, occupied when first car or second car covers 0.\n\nFirst car: u=12,13,14\n\nSecond car: u=3,4,5\n\nSo overall, occupied at u=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nMin = τ + s u = -59 +12u, max = h + s u = -48 +12u\n\n0 covered: -59+12u <=0 <= -48+12u\n\n-59+12u <=0 => 12u<=59 => u<=4.916, u<=4\n\n0<= -48+12u => 12u>=48 => u>=4\n\nSo u=4\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) h=0, τ=-11\n\nMin = τ + s u = -11 +12u, max = h + s u = 0 +12u\n\n0 covered: -11+12u <=0 <= 12u? 0 <= 12u always true for u>=0, since 12u>=0.\n\nAnd -11+12u <=0 => 12u <=11 => u<=0.916, u<=0\n\nBut u=0: -11+0 = -11 <=0, and 0<=0, so yes, covered at u=0.\n\nu<=0 and u>=0, so only u=0.\n\nNow, at u=0, min=-11+0=-11, max=0, so 0 is covered.\n\nFor u>0, min=-11+12u, for u=1, min=1>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSo second car covers only at u=0.\n\nFirst car covers at u=4.\n\nSo freeway 5 occupied at u=0 and u=4.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5? (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12), so same, occupied u=0 and u=4.\n\nFreeway 7: same, occupied u=0 and u=4.\n\nFreeway 8: same, occupied u=0 and u=4.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the occupied times u (offset from t_1).\n\nu=0 is turn t_1.\n\nk=1: occupied u=16,17,18,19\n\nk=2: same, u=16,17,18,19\n\nk=3: same, u=16,17,18,19\n\nk=4: occupied u=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nk=5: occupied u=0,4\n\nk=6: u=0,4\n\nk=7: u=0,4\n\nk=8: u=0,4\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at u=0 to y=9 at some u.\n\ny=0 at u=0.\n\nI must pass through y=1 to 8, each at some turn.\n\nSince I can move up, down, or stay, I need to choose a path and the timing to avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nAlso, since I start at y=0, and need to reach y=9, and I can only change by ±1 or 0 per turn, the minimal number of up moves is 9, but I might have down or stay, so H >=9.\n\nWith waiting, H could be larger.\n\nTo minimize H, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid the occupied times.\n\nNow, let me denote the position at each turn.\n\nAt turn u, position y_u.\n\nu=0: y=0\n\nThen after action, y_{u+1} = y_u + a_u, where a_u is U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\ny_u must be integer in 0 to 9.\n\nCollision at turn u if 1 <= y_u <=8 and freeway y_u is occupied at u.\n\nIf y_u=0 or 9, no collision.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions such that for all u, no collision, and y_u =9 for some u, and minimize that u.\n\nSince I start from u=0, y=0, and I need to reach y=9, the first time I am at y=9, that turn should be minimized.\n\nNow, since the occupied times are at low u for some, like k=5,6,7,8 occupied at u=0 and u=4.\n\nu=0 is now, turn t_1.\n\nAt u=0, I am at y=0, which is not on freeway, so safe. But if I were on y=5 at u=0, it would be occupied, but I am at y=0.\n\nNow, I need to move to higher y.\n\nLet me list the unsafe (occupied) times for each y.\n\nFor y=1: freeway 1, occupied u=16,17,18,19\n\ny=2: freeway 2, same, u=16-19\n\ny=3: freeway 3, same, u=16-19\n\ny=4: freeway 4, occupied u=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=5: freeway 5, occupied u=0,4\n\nBut u=0 is now.\n\ny=6: u=0,4\n\ny=7: u=0,4\n\ny=8: u=0,4\n\ny=4 has additional times u=12,13,14.\n\nNow, since I need to go through y=5 to 8, but they are occupied at u=0 and u=4.\n\nu=0: I am at y=0, so not on them.\n\nu=4: occupied, so I cannot be on y=5,6,7,8 at u=4.\n\nSimilarly, for y=4, cannot be on at u=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\ny=1,2,3 cannot be on at u=16-19.\n\nBut u=16-19 is later, so I might be able to pass before or after.\n\nTo minimize time, I should go up as soon as possible.\n\nBut at u=0, I am at y=0.\n\nI can take action: U, D, or S.\n\nFrom y=0, D: would go to y=0, since cannot go below.\n\nS: stay at y=0.\n\nU: go to y=1 at next turn.\n\nNow, if I go to y=1 at u=1.\n\nAt u=1, position y=1.\n\nIs freeway 1 occupied at u=1? From above, y=1 occupied only at u=16-19, so at u=1, not occupied, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can keep going up.\n\nBut I need to pass y=5 to 8, which are occupied at u=4.\n\nu=4 is turn t_1 +4.\n\nIf I go up directly, from u=0 y=0, action U, to y=1 at u=1.\n\nAction U, to y=2 at u=2.\n\nAction U, to y=3 at u=3.\n\nAction U, to y=4 at u=4.\n\nNow at u=4, y=4.\n\nIs freeway 4 occupied at u=4? Yes, from above, u=4 is occupied for y=4.\n\nSo collision.\n\nCannot be on y=4 at u=4.\n\nIf I go faster? But I can only move one step per turn, so from y=0 to y=4 in 4 steps: at u=1 y=1, u=2 y=2, u=3 y=3, u=4 y=4.\n\nExactly at u=4 on y=4, occupied.\n\nIf I stay at some point, but that would take more time.\n\nGo down, but that might not help.\n\nPerhaps start later.\n\nBut I need to minimize time to reach y=9.\n\nAt u=4, y=5,6,7,8 are also occupied, but if I were on them at u=4.\n\nBut in this path, I am on y=4 at u=4.\n\nNow, if I don't go to y=4 at u=4.\n\nFor example, at u=3, if I am at y=3, instead of going up, I could stay or go down.\n\nBut going down seems bad.\n\nStay at y=3 at u=4? At u=3, y=3, action S, then at u=4, still y=3.\n\nThen at u=4, on y=3, is it occupied? y=3 freeway 3, occupied at u=16-19, not at u=4, so safe.\n\nThen later I can go up.\n\nBut I need to go to y=4, but y=4 occupied at u=4, but also at u=3,5,12,13,14.\n\nu=3: occupied for y=4.\n\nAt u=4, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at u=4, I can take action, say U to y=4 at u=5.\n\nBut at u=5, y=4, is it occupied? u=5 is occupied for y=4, since u=5 in 3,4,5? u=3,4,5 for y=4.\n\nu=5 occupied, so cannot be on y=4 at u=5.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=4 at u=6.\n\nAt u=6, y=4, is it occupied? y=4 occupied at u=3,4,5,12,13,14. u=6 not in, so free? Let's see.\n\nu=6: 6 not in {3,4,5,12,13,14}, so free at u=6.\n\nSimilarly, u=7,8,9,10,11 should be free for y=4, except at u=12,13,14 occupied.\n\nBut u=12 is later.\n\nSo from u=4, y=3, I can go to y=4 at u=5? But u=5 occupied for y=4, no.\n\nAt u=4, y=3, I take action U, so at u=5, y=4.\n\nBut at u=5, y=4, occupied, collision.\n\nIf I take S at u=4, stay at y=3 at u=5.\n\nThen at u=5, y=3, safe, since not occupied.\n\nThen at u=5, I can go U to y=4 at u=6.\n\nAt u=6, y=4, not occupied (since u=6 not in occupied times), so safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can proceed.\n\nBut let's plan the whole path.\n\nFirst, I need to handle y=5 to 8, which are occupied at u=0 and u=4.\n\nu=0 not issue, u=4 is problem.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=5,6,7,8 at u=4.\n\nSimilarly, for y=4, I cannot be on at u=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nNow, to go from y=0 to y=9, I need to cross each level.\n\nThe critical point is around u=4.\n\nI need to be above or below the dangerous levels at u=4.\n\nSince y=5-8 are all occupied at u=4, I should not be on any of them at u=4.\n\nSo at u=4, I should be on y<=4 or y>=9, but y=9 is goal, probably not yet.\n\ny<=4 or y>8, but y=9 not reached, so y<=4.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 is occupied at u=4, so I cannot be on y=4 at u=4.\n\nTherefore, at u=4, I must be on y<=3 or y>=9.\n\nBut y=9 not yet, so y<=3.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 is free at u=4, as we saw.\n\nSo at u=4, I should be on y=0,1,2, or 3.\n\nNow, from start, I can go up to y=3 by u=3 or earlier.\n\nu=0: y=0\n\nAction U: u=1 y=1\n\nAction U: u=2 y=2\n\nAction U: u=3 y=3\n\nThen at u=3, y=3.\n\nNow at u=3, I need to choose action for u=3.\n\nIf I go U, to y=4 at u=4, but y=4 occupied at u=4, collision.\n\nSo I cannot go U at u=3.\n\nI could go S or D.\n\nIf S, stay at y=3 at u=4.\n\nAt u=4, y=3, which is safe, as freeway 3 not occupied at u=4.\n\nThen at u=4, I can go U to y=4 at u=5, but u=5 y=4 occupied? Yes, u=5 is occupied for y=4, collision.\n\nIf at u=4 I stay S, y=3 at u=5, then at u=5 I can go U to y=4 at u=6.\n\nAt u=6, y=4 not occupied, safe.\n\nThen I can go up.\n\nBut let's see later for y=4 at u=12-14, but that might be avoidable if I pass earlier.\n\nFirst, let's get past u=4.\n\nAlso, for y=5-8, I need to avoid being on them at u=4.\n\nAt u=4, I am at y=3, as above.\n\nThen at u=4, action: if I go U, to y=4 at u=5, but u=5 y=4 occupied, bad.\n\nIf I go S, to y=3 at u=5.\n\nThen at u=5, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at u=5, action U to y=4 at u=6.\n\nAt u=6, y=4, not occupied (since u=6 not in {3,4,5,12,13,14}), so safe.\n\nThen I need to go to y=5.\n\nBut y=5 is freeway 5, occupied at u=0 and u=4, but u=6 not occupied, so should be free except at those times.\n\ny=5 occupied only at u=0 and u=4, so at u=6, free.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo at u=6, y=4, action U to y=5 at u=7.\n\nAt u=7, y=5, not occupied (u=7 not u=0 or u=4), safe.\n\nSimilarly, action U to y=6 at u=8.\n\nu=8, y=6, freeway 6 occupied only u=0,4, so u=8 free, safe.\n\nU to y=7 at u=9, safe.\n\nU to y=8 at u=10, safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at u=11.\n\nAt u=11, y=9, which is safe, goal reached.\n\nBut is that minimal?\n\nu from 0 to 11, so at turn u=11, position y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from u=0 to u=10, actions at t=0 to 10, 11 actions, position at u=11.\n\nH=11, since after 11 actions, at t_1+11, y=9.\n\nBut let's list the actions:\n\nu=0 (turn t_1): action U, to y=1 at u=1\n\nu=1: action U, to y=2 at u=2\n\nu=2: action U, to y=3 at u=3\n\nu=3: now at y=3, need to avoid going to y=4 at u=4.\n\nIn the above, at u=3, I stayed or something.\n\nIn my plan, at u=3, I am at y=3.\n\nIf I go U, bad.\n\nSo I must not go U at u=3.\n\nI could go S or D.\n\nIn the sequence I thought: at u=3, action S, so stay at y=3 at u=4.\n\nThen at u=4, action S, stay at y=3 at u=5? No.\n\nEarlier I said:\n\nAt u=3, action S: so at u=4, y=3 (since S, no move)\n\nThen at u=4, action? If I go U, to y=4 at u=5, but u=5 y=4 occupied.\n\nSo at u=4, I should not go U, instead go S again or something.\n\nThen at u=4, action S, so at u=5, y=3.\n\nThen at u=5, action U, to y=4 at u=6.\n\nAt u=6, y=4, safe.\n\nThen u=6, action U, to y=5 at u=7\n\nu=7, action U, to y=6 at u=8\n\nu=8, action U, to y=7 at u=9\n\nu=9, action U, to y=8 at u=10\n\nu=10, action U, to y=9 at u=11\n\nYes.\n\nActions:\n\nAt turn u=0 (t_1): U\n\nu=1: U\n\nu=2: U\n\nu=3: S  (stay at y=3)\n\nu=4: S  (stay at y=3)\n\nu=5: U  (to y=4 at u=6)\n\nu=6: U  (to y=5 at u=7)\n\nu=7: U  (to y=6 at u=8)\n\nu=8: U  (to y=7 at u=9)\n\nu=9: U  (to y=8 at u=10)\n\nu=10: U  (to y=9 at u=11)\n\nNow, check for collisions:\n\nu=0: y=0, safe\n\nu=1: y=1, freeway1 not occupied (only 16-19), safe\n\nu=2: y=2, freeway2 not occupied, safe\n\nu=3: y=3, freeway3 not occupied, safe\n\nu=4: y=3, freeway3 not occupied, safe\n\nu=5: y=3, freeway3 not occupied, safe\n\nu=6: y=4, freeway4: occupied at u=3,4,5,12,13,14; u=6 not, so free, safe\n\nu=7: y=5, freeway5 occupied only u=0,4; u=7 not, free, safe\n\nu=8: y=6, similarly, free except u=0,4, safe\n\nu=9: y=7, free except u=0,4, safe\n\nu=10: y=8, free except u=0,4, safe\n\nu=11: y=9, safe, goal.\n\nNow, H=11 turns? u from 0 to 10 for actions, 11 actions, position at u=11.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nFor example, if I can reach y=3 earlier or something, but I reached y=3 at u=3, which is fast.\n\nBut at u=4, I had to stay at y=3, and also at u=5 I was still at y=3, so I wasted two turns staying.\n\nCan I avoid that?\n\nFor example, at u=3, instead of staying, I could go down to y=2, but that seems worse.\n\nOr, I could go to y=4 at a different time.\n\ny=4 is only occupied at u=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nSo at u=2, if I can be at y=4, but at u=2, from start: u=0 y=0, u=1 y=1, u=2 y=2, cannot be y=4 at u=2.\n\nu=6 is free, as I used.\n\nBut between u=3 and u=6, I have to wait.\n\nu=1,2 are free for y=4, but I am not there.\n\nFor example, if I stay at start.\n\nu=0: action S, stay at y=0 at u=1.\n\nBut y=0 safe, but I need to move up.\n\nThen u=1: action U to y=1 at u=2? At u=1, position y=1? Let's see.\n\nAt u=0, y=0, action S: so at u=1, y=0? No.\n\nAction at turn u: determines y_{u+1}.\n\nAt turn u, position y_u, action a_u, then y_{u+1} = y_u + delta.\n\nSo at u=0, y_0=0.\n\nIf a_0 = S, then y_1 = 0 (at u=1)\n\nThen at u=1, y_1=0, action U, then y_2 =1 at u=2.\n\nThen u=2, y_2=1, action U, y_3=2 at u=3.\n\nu=3, y_3=2, action U, y_4=3 at u=4.\n\nAt u=4, y=3, safe.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut now at u=4, y=3, I can go to y=4 at u=5? But u=5 y=4 occupied, no.\n\nSo still need to wait until u=6 to go to y=4.\n\nIn fact, from u=4 y=3, if I go U at u=4, to y=4 at u=5, occupied.\n\nSo I must stay or go down.\n\nThus, I have to stay at y=3 for multiple turns until u=5, then go to y=4 at u=6.\n\nIn my first sequence, I stayed at u=3 and u=4 at y=3.\n\nAt u=3, y=3, action S: stay at y=3 for u=4.\n\nThen at u=4, action S: stay at y=3 for u=5.\n\nThen at u=5, action U: to y=4 at u=6.\n\nI could at u=4 go down, but that would be worse.\n\nSo minimal waiting.\n\nNow, what about later, y=4 has occupied at u=12-14, but in this path, I am at y=4 at u=6, which is before u=12, so fine.\n\nThen I go directly to y=9 by u=11.\n\nBut is u=11 the earliest?\n\nSuppose I try to go to y=4 earlier.\n\nFor example, at u=2, if I could be at y=4, but impossible, since u=0 y=0, u=1 y=1, u=2 y=2 max.\n\nu=1: y=1, if I go U to y=2 at u=2, etc.\n\nCannot reach y=4 before u=4, but at u=4 occupied.\n\nAt u=5 occupied, so earliest free is u=6 for y=4.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5-8, they are free except u=0 and u=4, so as long as I am not on them at u=4, I can pass later.\n\nIn the sequence above, I pass y=5 at u=7, which is after u=4, fine.\n\nNow, but I have to consider y=1,2,3 which have occupied at u=16-19, but since u=16 is much later, and I am passing before, at u=1,2,3, which is fine.\n\nIn this path, I reach y=9 at u=11.\n\nu=11 corresponds to turn t_1 + 11.\n\nH=11 actions? Actions from u=0 to u=10, 11 actions.\n\nPosition at u=11.\n\nMinimal H: since I need 9 up moves, and I have 2 stay moves, so 11 actions.\n\nIs it possible with only one stay? Or zero?\n\nIf I can avoid the occupied times with less waiting.\n\nFor example, at u=4, instead of being at y=3, could I be at lower y?\n\nBut that might take more time to go up later.\n\nOr higher, but cannot.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=4 at u=2, impossible.\n\nOr, perhaps I can be on y=5 at u=4, but y=5 occupied at u=4, cannot.\n\nSimilarly, all y=4 to8 occupied at u=4 except y=4 is occupied, y=5-8 occupied.\n\ny=4 occupied, y=5-8 occupied at u=4.\n\nSo only y=0,1,2,3 safe at u=4.\n\ny=3 is safe, as I used.\n\nCould I be at y=2 at u=4?\n\nFor example, start: u=0 y=0, U to y=1 at u=1\n\nThen at u=1, instead of U, I do S, so y=1 at u=2? At u=1, position y=1, action S, then y_2=1 at u=2.\n\nThen at u=2, action U, to y=2 at u=3? y_3=2 at u=3.\n\nThen at u=3, action U, to y=3 at u=4.\n\nSame as before, y=3 at u=4.\n\nIf at u=2, I do S, then y=2 at u=3, then at u=3 action U to y=3 at u=4.\n\nStill y=3 at u=4.\n\nIf I go down, worse.\n\nSo I must be at y<=3 at u=4, and since y=3 is the highest possible at that point, it's best.\n\nThen from y=3, I need to go to y=4, but cannot at u=5 because occupied, so must go at u=6.\n\nThus, I have to have two turns where I don't go up: at u=3 and u=4, I stay at y=3.\n\nIn actions, at u=3 and u=4, I do S.\n\nThen at u=5, I do U to go to y=4 at u=6.\n\nIn terms of reaching y=9, since I have two extra stays, H=11.\n\nWithout any extra, min H=9, but not possible due to u=4 conflict.\n\nPerhaps I can go up faster later, but no.\n\nAnother thing: for y=4, it is occupied at u=12-14, but since I pass at u=6, which is before, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, for y=1,2,3, occupied at u=16-19, I pass early, fine.\n\nSo H=11 should be minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm the actions.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=78.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U (since u=1, turn t_1 +1)\n\nDefine:\n\nSet t = turn number.\n\nt_1 =78\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nt=78: y=0\n\nAction a_{78} = U, so y_{79} = y_{78} +1 =1\n\nt=79: y=1, action a_{79}=U, so y_{80}=2\n\nt=80: y=2, action a_{80}=U, so y_{81}=3\n\nt=81: y=3, action a_{81}=S, so y_{82}=3 (stay)\n\nt=82: y=3, action a_{82}=S, so y_{83}=3 (stay)\n\nt=83: y=3, action a_{83}=U, so y_{84}=4\n\nt=84: y=4, action a_{84}=U, so y_{85}=5\n\nt=85: y=5, action a_{85}=U, so y_{86}=6\n\nt=86: y=6, action a_{86}=U, so y_{87}=7\n\nt=87: y=7, action a_{87}=U, so y_{88}=8\n\nt=88: y=8, action a_{88}=U, so y_{89}=9\n\nAt t=89, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, actions from t=78 to t=88, that's 11 actions: t=78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88.\n\nH=11.\n\nSequence: a_{78} to a_{88}.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed.\n\nBut in the format, it says {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to 10, actions at t_1 to t_1+10.\n\nt_1=78, so turns 78 to 88, which is 11 turns.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0: 78, t=1:79, ..., t=10:88.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but I think I missed something.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=84, y=4, which is freeway 4, and at turn t=84, u=84 - 78 =6, since t_1=78, u=t - t_1.\n\nt=84, u=84-78=6, y=4, not occupied, as before.\n\nSimilarly all fine.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose I reach earlier.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=4 at u=6, but go faster to higher levels.\n\nBut from y=4 to y=9, it takes 5 up moves, from u=6 to u=11 for y=9, same as before.\n\nIf I can be at y=4 earlier, but I cannot, because u=4 and u=5 occupied.\n\nu=6 is the earliest I can be at y=4.\n\nu=6, y=4.\n\nThen y=5 at u=7, ..., y=9 at u=11.\n\nCannot be faster.\n\nPerhaps I can skip some levels or something, but no, I have to go through each integer y.\n\nOr, at u=4, if I am at y=2 or less, but then I need more up moves later.\n\nFor example, suppose at u=0: S, stay y=0 at u=1\n\nu=1: U, to y=1 at u=2\n\nu=2: S, stay y=1 at u=3\n\netc., but that would be slower.\n\nSo H=11 seems minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have two S actions at u=3 and u=4, which are t=81 and t=82.\n\nt=81 and t=82 both S.\n\nNow, but let me write the answer.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 5,6,7,8, at u=0, they are occupied, but since I am not on them at u=0, it's fine.\n\nAnother thing: at u=4, y=5-8 occupied, but I am not on them.\n\nIn my path, I am on y=3 at u=4.\n\nNow, but I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 faster by not waiting, but I don't think so.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=3 at u=3, then at u=3, instead of S, I go down to y=2 at u=4.\n\nThen at u=4, y=2, safe.\n\nBut then I need to go up again, so at u=4, U to y=3 at u=5, then U to y=4 at u=6, same as before, but now I have an extra down and up, so worse, H larger.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, minimal H=11.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions.\n\nt_1=78.\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: S\n\nTurn 82: S\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nAfter Turn 88 action U, at turn 89, y=9.\n\nActions from 78 to 88.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point collision.\n\nTurn 78: y=0, safe\n\nTurn 79: y=1, freeway1 not occ, safe\n\nTurn 80: y=2, freeway2 not occ, safe\n\nTurn 81: y=3, freeway3 not occ (occ at u=16-19, u=81-78=3? t=81, u=t-t_1=81-78=3, y=3, not occ, safe\n\nTurn 82: y=3, u=82-78=4, y=3, not occ, safe\n\nTurn 83: y=3, u=83-78=5, y=3, not occ, safe? At turn 83, position y=3, action U, so at turn 84, y=4.\n\nAt turn 83, I am at y=3, which is safe.\n\nTurn 84: position y=4, u=84-78=6, freeway4 occ at u=3,4,5,12,13,14; u=6 not, so safe\n\nTurn 85: y=5, u=7, freeway5 occ u=0,4; u=7 not, safe\n\nTurn 86: y=6, u=8, freeway6 occ u=0,4; u=8 not, safe\n\nTurn 87: y=7, u=9, safe\n\nTurn 88: y=8, u=10, safe\n\nThen after action U at turn 88, at turn 89 y=9.\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, the sequence is for actions at turn 78 to 88.\n\nIn the box, list:\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: S\n\nTurn 82: S\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nH=11.\n\nBut in the sequence, turn 83: U to y=4 at next turn.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's minimal.\n\nBut in freeway 4, there was a car at (24,13,right,4), but it didn't affect since it doesn't cover 0.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nNow, about the answer format.\n\nIt should be in a box.\n\nAlso, for the sequence, I need to write it clearly.\n\nSince t_1=78, and actions from t_1 to t_1+10.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = t_1 + 10 =88, since H=11.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =78 +11 -1=88, yes.\n\nActions at turns 78 to 88.\n\nNow, write:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 78: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 79: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 80: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 81: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 82: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 83: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 84: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: & U \\end{array} }\n\nIn text, but I think it's fine.\n\nSince it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\", etc.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 5,6,7,8, there is a car at (0,-11,right,12), which at u=0 covers 0, but at u=0, I am at y=0, not on freeway, so ok.\n\nSimilarly at u=4, but I avoid.\n\nI think correct.\n\nSo minimal H=11.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 78\\) with the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), the sequence of actions must avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\). The cars move right at constant speeds, and their positions at any turn \\(T\\) can be calculated from the initial state at turn 78. Collision occurs only if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) at turn \\(T\\) and 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at \\(T\\).\n\nThe occupancy of each freeway at turn offsets \\(u = T - t_1\\) (where \\(u = 0\\) is turn 78) is as follows:\n- Freeway 1: Occupied at \\(u = 16, 17, 18, 19\\)\n- Freeway 2: Occupied at \\(u = 16, 17, 18, 19\\)\n- Freeway 3: Occupied at \\(u = 16, 17, 18, 19\\)\n- Freeway 4: Occupied at \\(u = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\\)\n- Freeway 5: Occupied at \\(u = 0, 4\\)\n- Freeway 6: Occupied at \\(u = 0, 4\\)\n- Freeway 7: Occupied at \\(u = 0, 4\\)\n- Freeway 8: Occupied at \\(u = 0, 4\\)\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) at \\(u = 0\\) and must reach \\(y = 9\\) (safe) as quickly as possible. The minimal path requires moving up when possible but waiting at \\(y = 3\\) for two turns (\\(u = 4\\) and \\(u = 5\\)) to avoid being on \\(y = 4\\) or \\(y = 5\\) to \\(8\\) during occupied times, particularly at \\(u = 4\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions that achieves this in \\(H = 11\\) turns (actions from turn 78 to 88, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 89) is:\n- At turn 78 (\\(u = 0\\)): Move up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 79. Safe as \\(y = 1\\) is free.\n- At turn 79 (\\(u = 1\\)): Move up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 80. Safe as \\(y = 2\\) is free.\n- At turn 80 (\\(u = 2\\)): Move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 81. Safe as \\(y = 3\\) is free.\n- At turn 81 (\\(u = 3\\)): Stay to remain at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 82. Safe as \\(y = 3\\) is free at \\(u = 4\\).\n- At turn 82 (\\(u = 4\\)): Stay to remain at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 83. Safe as \\(y = 3\\) is free at \\(u = 5\\).\n- At turn 83 (\\(u = 5\\)): Move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 84. Safe as \\(y = 4\\) is free at \\(u = 6\\).\n- At turn 84 (\\(u = 6\\)): Move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 85. Safe as \\(y = 5\\) is free at \\(u = 7\\).\n- At turn 85 (\\(u = 7\\)): Move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 86. Safe as \\(y = 6\\) is free at \\(u = 8\\).\n- At turn 86 (\\(u = 8\\)): Move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 87.

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,2) to (0,9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 80, and the player starts at y=2.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, with y clamped between 0 and 9. Since we're going from 2 to 9, we'll mostly want to move up, but we have to avoid the cars.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each freeway has cars moving left or right with given speeds. The car positions are given at turn t_1=80, and for future turns, we need to compute where they are based on their speed and direction.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where for some car, 0 is in its span at that turn. Importantly, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, if I move from y to y+1, at turn T I'm still on y, and at T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThis means that when you move, you only check the cars on your current freeway at the current turn. You don't get hit by cars on the freeway you're moving to until you're actually there, which is next turn.\n\nSo, for collision: at turn T, player is on y_T. We need that for all cars on freeway y_T, 0 is not in their span at turn T.\n\nSpan at time T is computed based on initial span at t_1 and the time difference.\n\nLet me denote the time from t_1: let τ = T - t_1, so at time τ after t_1.\n\nFor a car, at t_1, it has head h, tail τ (I'll use t for tail to avoid confusion with time), direction d, speed s.\n\nThe span at time τ (from t_1) is:\n\nIf left-moving: span(τ) = [h - s*τ, t - s*τ]  (since left, decreasing x)\n\nIn the rule: left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t_1), t - s*(T-t_1)]\n\nBut t is tail, which for left-moving, if head is h and tail is t, and it's moving left, so head is more left, I think? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nHere τ is tail, I think. In the table, it's written as (head, tail, direction, speed), so for example, freeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3)\n\nBut -42 and -53, with right direction. If it's moving right, and head is at -42, tail at -53, that means tail is left of head? Let's think.\n\nTypically, for a right-moving car, head is the front, so if it's moving right, head should have higher x, but here head is -42, tail is -53, -42 > -53, so head is at higher x, which makes sense for right-moving: head at x=-42, tail at x=-53, so the car spans from -53 to -42, I think? But the span is [τ, h] for right-moving? I'm confused.\n\nLook at the update rule:\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3), but which is head and tail?\n\nIt says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nSo for freeway 1: head h = -42, tail τ = -53, direction right, speed 3.\n\nBut for right-moving, the update is: Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\n\nAt t_1, τ = -53, h = -42, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-53, -42]? But -53 to -42, and moving right, so at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-53 + sΔT, -42 + sΔT]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving except possibly others, but here all are right-moving I think.\n\nIn the given state, all cars are right-moving? Let's see:\n\nFreeway 1: right\n\nFreeway 2: right\n\nFreeway 3: right\n\nFreeway 4: all right\n\nFreeway 5: both right\n\netc. All cars are right-moving in this instance.\n\nSo, for a right-moving car, at time τ relative to t_1, the span is [τ + s*τ, h + s*τ] where τ is tail, h is head.\n\nSet Δt = T - t_1, so at time T, span is [tail + s*Δt, head + s*Δt]\n\nAnd collision if player is at (0, y) at turn T, and for some car on freeway y, 0 is in the span at T, i.e., tail + s*Δt ≤ 0 ≤ head + s*Δt.\n\nSince head > tail for right-moving cars, as head is right.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: head = -42, tail = -53, so at t_1, span [-53, -42]? But -53 to -42, and 0 is not in it.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nNow, player starts at y=2 at t_1=80.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, and freeways are from 1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars, I assume. The vertical axis y=0 to 9, freeways on y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should have no cars, so we can be there safely.\n\nPlayer is at (0,2), so on freeway 2? Positions are (x,y), but cars are on specific y, so at (0,y), for y=1 to 8, if there's a car at x=0 at that time, collision.\n\nBut x=0 is the position we care about.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, since we need to go from y=2 to y=9, that's 7 steps up, so minimum H=7 if we can move up every turn without collision.\n\nBut we have to avoid cars on the way.\n\nEach turn we can move U, D, or S.\n\nBut since we want to go up, D might not be useful, but S could be used to wait.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions over time.\n\nCurrent turn t_1 = 80.\n\nSet τ = 0 at t_1.\n\nFor each freeway, at time τ, the span for each car is [tail + s*τ, head + s*τ]\n\nThen, at position x=0, collision if for some car on that freeway, tail + s*τ ≤ 0 ≤ head + s*τ.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head=-42, tail=-53, s=3, right\n\nFreeway 2: same, head=-42, tail=-53, s=3, right\n\nFreeway 3: same, head=-42, tail=-53, s=3, right\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: \n\nCar1: head=-40, tail=-51, s=4, right\n\nCar2: head=-4, tail=-15, s=4, right\n\nCar3: head=32, tail=21, s=4, right? Head=32, tail=21, so tail=21, head=32, so span [21,32] at t_1, moving right.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars:\n\nCar1: head=-24, tail=-35, s=12, right\n\nCar2: head=24, tail=13, s=12, right\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5? Head and tail for both cars: (-24,-35) and (24,13), s=12\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nIn the table:\n\nFreeway 5: (-24,-35,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we need to find when a car occupies x=0 at time τ.\n\nThat is, for a given y and τ, if there is a car on y such that min_span ≤ 0 ≤ max_span, where min and max depend on direction, but all right, so left end is tail + sτ, right end is head + sτ.\n\nSo condition: tail + sτ ≤ 0 ≤ head + sτ\n\nSince tail ≤ head.\n\nNow, for freeway 1: tail=-53, head=-42, s=3\n\nSo -53 + 3τ ≤ 0 ≤ -42 + 3τ\n\nSolve inequalities:\n\n-53 + 3τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 3τ ≤ 53 ⇒ τ ≤ 53/3 ≈ 17.666, so τ ≤ 17\n\n0 ≤ -42 + 3τ ⇒ 3τ ≥ 42 ⇒ τ ≥ 14\n\nSo for τ between 14 and 17 inclusive, x=0 is occupied on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2: same as freeway 1, since same car parameters: τ from 14 to 17 inclusive.\n\nFreeway 3: same, τ=14,15,16,17.\n\nNow freeway 4 has three cars.\n\nFirst car: head=-40, tail=-51, s=4\n\n-51 + 4τ ≤ 0 ≤ -40 + 4τ\n\n-51 + 4τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 4τ ≤ 51 ⇒ τ ≤ 51/4 = 12.75, so τ ≤ 12\n\n0 ≤ -40 + 4τ ⇒ 4τ ≥ 40 ⇒ τ ≥ 10\n\nSo for τ=10,11,12\n\nBut τ integer, I assume? Turns are discrete, so τ integer.\n\nYes, turns are discrete, τ = 0,1,2,...\n\nSo for car1 on y=4: occupied at τ=10,11,12\n\nSecond car on y=4: head=-4, tail=-15, s=4\n\n-15 + 4τ ≤ 0 ≤ -4 + 4τ\n\n-15 + 4τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 4τ ≤ 15 ⇒ τ ≤ 15/4 = 3.75, τ ≤ 3\n\n0 ≤ -4 + 4τ ⇒ 4τ ≥ 4 ⇒ τ ≥ 1\n\nSo for τ=1,2,3\n\nThird car on y=4: head=32, tail=21, s=4\n\n21 + 4τ ≤ 0 ≤ 32 + 4τ\n\nBut 21 + 4τ ≤ 0? 21 + 4τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 4τ ≤ -21, impossible since τ≥0, so never true. 0 ≤ 32 + 4τ always true, but the left inequality fails. So this car never has x=0 in span, since min is 21 +4τ >0 for all τ.\n\nSo for freeway 4, occupied when either car1 or car2 is at x=0.\n\nCar2 at τ=1,2,3\n\nCar1 at τ=10,11,12\n\nSo overall, y=4 occupied at τ=1,2,3,10,11,12\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars\n\nCar1: head=-24, tail=-35, s=12\n\n-35 + 12τ ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 12τ\n\n-35 + 12τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 12τ ≤ 35 ⇒ τ ≤ 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so τ ≤ 2\n\n0 ≤ -24 + 12τ ⇒ 12τ ≥ 24 ⇒ τ ≥ 2\n\nSo τ=2\n\nCar2: head=24, tail=13, s=12\n\n13 + 12τ ≤ 0 ≤ 24 + 12τ\n\n13 + 12τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 12τ ≤ -13, impossible, so never.\n\nSo only car1 at τ=2\n\nThus y=5 occupied at τ=2 only? τ=2\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as freeway 5? Cars: (-24,-35,right,12) and (24,13,right,12)\n\nSame as above, so car1: tail=-35, head=-24, s=12\n\n-35 +12τ ≤0 ≤ -24 +12τ\n\nτ ≤ 35/12≈2.916, τ≤2\n\nτ ≥ 24/12=2, so τ=2\n\nCar2 never, so y=6 occupied at τ=2\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same, occupied at τ=2\n\nFreeway 8: same, occupied at τ=2\n\nNow, freeway 1,2,3 occupied τ=14,15,16,17\n\nFreeway 4 occupied τ=1,2,3,10,11,12\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 occupied at τ=2 only? For each, at τ=2.\n\nBut τ=2 is occupied on multiple freeways.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at τ=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some τ.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nNow, the path: from y=2 to y=9, must pass through y=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut we can stay or move down, but since we want min turns, probably go up as fast as possible, avoiding collisions.\n\nAt each turn τ, player is at some y, and we choose action for next position.\n\nLet me denote the turn at time τ, position y_τ.\n\nAt time τ, player is at y_τ, and we choose a_τ which determines y_{τ+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn based on y_τ and the cars at that time.\n\nSpecifically, at turn T (which is t_1 + τ), player is on y_T, and we need that for freeway y_T, no car has 0 in span at time T.\n\nNow, for τ=0, t=80, player at y=2.\n\nIs y=2 safe at τ=0?\n\nFreeway 2: cars, at τ=0, we have car with tail=-53, head=-42, s=3.\n\n-53 +0 = -53 ≤0? 0 ≤ -42? No, 0 > -42, so -53 ≤0 is true, but 0≤ -42? -42 is negative, 0 > -42, so 0 ≤ -42 false. So 0 not in [-53,-42], so no collision at τ=0 for y=2.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but we're on y=2.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimum 7 steps up.\n\nBut let's see the obstacles.\n\nFirst, freeway 4 has cars at τ=1,2,3 and 10,11,12. So at τ=1,2,3, y=4 is occupied.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 5,6,7,8 are occupied only at τ=2.\n\nAnd freeways 1,2,3 occupied at τ=14,15,16,17, which is later, but since we start early, we might avoid that by being past y=3 before τ=14.\n\nBut y=1,2,3 have cars only at τ=14-17, which is far, τ=14 is 14 turns later.\n\nSince we start at τ=0, and we can be at y=9 before τ=14 easily.\n\nFor example, if we move up every turn, from y=2 at τ=0.\n\nAfter one U, at τ=1, y=3\n\nAfter two U, τ=2, y=4\n\nAfter three U, τ=3, y=5\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut at each step, we need to check if the position is safe.\n\nAt τ=0, y=2: safe, as above.\n\nNow, choose action for τ=0 to go to next y.\n\nWe want to go to y=3 at τ=1.\n\nFirst, at τ=1, if we are at y=3.\n\nFreeway 3: at τ=1, is it occupied?\n\nFreeway 3: same as 1 and 2, occupied at τ=14-17, not at τ=1, so y=3 at τ=1 should be safe.\n\nCars on y=3: at τ=1, tail + sτ = -53 +3*1 = -50, head + sτ = -42 +3 = -39, span [-50,-39], 0 not in it, yes safe.\n\nNow, if we move U at τ=0, we go to y=3 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, we are at y=3, safe.\n\nNow, choose action for τ=1 to go to next.\n\nWe want to go to y=4 at τ=2.\n\nBut at τ=2, y=4: is it safe?\n\nFreeway 4: at τ=2, occupied? From earlier, y=4 occupied at τ=1,2,3.\n\nτ=2 is occupied.\n\nSpecifically, car2 on y=4 at τ=1,2,3: tail=-15, head=-4, s=4.\n\nAt τ=2, tail + sτ = -15 + 4*2 = -15+8= -7, head + sτ = -4 +8=4, so span [-7,4], 0 is between -7 and 4, yes, so occupied, collision if at y=4 at τ=2.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=4 at τ=2.\n\nIf we try to go to y=4 at τ=2, we would be there at turn t=80+2, and collision.\n\nAt τ=1, we are at y=3, we choose action: if we choose U, we go to y=4 at τ=2, but that is unsafe.\n\nWe could choose S, stay at y=3 for τ=2, or D, to y=2, but y=2 might be safe or not.\n\nFirst, at τ=1, if we choose S, then at τ=2, we are still at y=3.\n\ny=3 at τ=2: freeway 3, span at τ=2: tail -53 +6= -47? s=3, τ=2, tail + sτ = -53 + 3*2 = -53+6= -47, head + sτ = -42 +6= -36, span [-47,-36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nIf we choose D, to y=2 at τ=2, y=2 at τ=2: freeway 2, same, tail -53 +6= -47, head -42+6=-36, span [-47,-36], 0 not in, safe, but we are going down, which is away from goal.\n\nBut min turns, so probably not good.\n\nNow, back to τ=1 at y=3.\n\nWe cannot go U to y=4 at τ=2 because unsafe.\n\nWe could go S, stay at y=3 for τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, we are at y=3, safe as above.\n\nNow, at τ=2, we choose action.\n\nWe want to go to y=4, but at τ=2, y=4 is occupied, but we are at y=3, so if we go U, we go to y=4 at τ=3? Let's see.\n\nAt turn τ, we are at y_τ, choose a_τ, which sets y_{τ+1}.\n\nAt time τ, position y_τ.\n\nAfter action, at time τ+1, position y_{τ+1}.\n\nCollision at time τ if y_τ has car at x=0.\n\nFor moving to y_{τ+1}, we don't care about that freeway until we are there.\n\nAt τ=2, we are at y=3 (if we stayed).\n\ny=3 at τ=2 is safe.\n\nNow, we choose action for τ=2: if we choose U, then at τ=3, we go to y=4.\n\nBut at τ=3, y=4: is it safe?\n\nFreeway 4 at τ=3: occupied? τ=3 is in the occupied times, τ=1,2,3 for car2.\n\nAt τ=3, car2: tail -15 +4*3= -15+12= -3, head -4+12=8, span [-3,8], 0 in it, yes occupied.\n\nCar1 at τ=3: car1 on y=4, tail -51 +4*3= -51+12= -39, head -40+12= -28, span [-39,-28], 0 not in.\n\nBut car2 has 0, so y=4 occupied at τ=3.\n\nThus, if we go to y=4 at τ=3, we are on y=4 at time τ=3, collision.\n\nSo unsafe.\n\nWe could choose S at τ=2, stay at y=3 for τ=3.\n\ny=3 at τ=3: freeway 3, tail -53 +9= -44, head -42+9= -33, span [-44,-33], 0 not in, safe.\n\nBut we are not progressing.\n\nNow, y=4 is occupied from τ=1 to 3, but after that, next occupied at τ=10,11,12.\n\nSo from τ=4 to 9, y=4 is safe? Let's check.\n\nFreeway 4: cars, car1 at τ=10,11,12; car2 at τ=1,2,3; car3 never.\n\nSo between τ=4 and 9, no car at x=0, so y=4 is safe at τ=4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nτ=4 to 9 inclusive? τ=4: car1 requires τ>=10, car2 τ<=3, so yes, τ=4 to 9 safe for y=4.\n\nBut we also have to go through other freeways.\n\nAt τ=2, if we stay at y=3, then at τ=3 we can go to y=4, but τ=3 y=4 unsafe, as above.\n\nAt τ=3, if we are at y=3, and we choose to go to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=3, we are at y=3, choose U, then at τ=4, we are at y=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=4 should be safe, as above.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's list the occupied times for each freeway.\n\nFreeway y=1: occupied τ=14,15,16,17\n\ny=2: same, τ=14-17\n\ny=3: same, τ=14-17\n\ny=4: occupied τ=1,2,3 (car2) and τ=10,11,12 (car1)\n\ny=5: occupied only at τ=2 (from car1)\n\ny=6: occupied at τ=2\n\ny=7: at τ=2\n\ny=8: at τ=2\n\ny=9: no cars, always safe.\n\nWe start at τ=0, y=2.\n\nAt τ=0, y=2 safe.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nThe critical points are around τ=2, where multiple freeways are occupied.\n\nSpecifically, at τ=2, y=4,5,6,7,8 are all occupied? y=4 at τ=2 occupied, y=5 at τ=2 occupied, similarly y=6,7,8 at τ=2 occupied.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 each occupied at τ=2.\n\nBut only at τ=2, not other times except y=4 at multiple times.\n\nNow, since we start at y=2, τ=0.\n\nIf we move up immediately:\n\nOption 1: U at τ=0, go to y=3 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=3 safe.\n\nThen, at τ=1, if we go U, to y=4 at τ=2, but y=4 at τ=2 occupied, unsafe.\n\nIf we go S at τ=1, stay at y=3 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=3 safe (since occupied only at τ=14-17).\n\nThen at τ=2, we are at y=3, we can go U to y=4 at τ=3, but y=4 at τ=3 occupied, unsafe.\n\nGo S again, stay at y=3 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=3 safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, go U to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=4 safe (since not occupied at τ=4).\n\nThen from there, we can continue up.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=2, safe.\n\nAction: U, go to y=3 at τ=1.\n\nτ=1, y=3, safe.\n\nAction: S (since if U, go to y=4 at τ=2 unsafe), so S, stay at y=3 for τ=2.\n\nτ=2, y=3, safe.\n\nAction: S, stay at y=3 for τ=3? Or go U?\n\nAt τ=2, if we go U, we go to y=4 at τ=3, but τ=3 y=4 unsafe.\n\nSo we must stay or go down, but down not good.\n\nSo at τ=2, choose S, so at τ=3, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, we can go U to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=4, which is safe (τ=4 not occupied).\n\nThen from y=4, we can go up.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9.\n\nNow, after reaching y=4 at τ=4, we can move up each turn if possible.\n\nBut there is another danger: y=4 occupied at τ=10,11,12, but τ=10 is later, we can be past y=4 by then.\n\nSimilarly, y=1,2,3 occupied at τ=14-17, later.\n\nBut also, at τ=2, y=5,6,7,8 are occupied, but we are not there yet.\n\nNow, from y=4 at τ=4.\n\nWe want to go to y=5.\n\nBut y=5 is occupied only at τ=2, which is past, so at τ>2, y=5 is safe? Let's see.\n\nFreeway 5: occupied only at τ=2, so for τ≠2, safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8: occupied only at τ=2, so for other τ, safe.\n\ny=4 has the τ=10-12 issue.\n\nSo at τ=4, y=4 safe.\n\nNow, go U to y=5 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, y=5: since τ=5 ≠2, should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, go U to y=6 at τ=6, safe.\n\nU to y=7 at τ=7, safe.\n\nU to y=8 at τ=8, safe.\n\nU to y=9 at τ=9.\n\nAt τ=9, y=9, safe, and we are done.\n\nBut we started at τ=0, y=2.\n\nSequence:\n\nτ=0: y=2, action U, go to y=3 at τ=1\n\nτ=1: y=3, action S, stay, so y=3 at τ=2\n\nIn terms of actions: at turn τ, we are at position, choose action for next.\n\nAt time t_1 + τ, position y_τ.\n\nAfter action a_τ, position at time t_1 + τ +1 is y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy.\n\nIn the sequence, we need actions starting from t_1.\n\nt_1 = 80.\n\nAt τ=0, turn 80, position y=2, choose a_{80}\n\nIf we choose U, then at turn 81, position y=3\n\nThen at turn 81, we are at y=3, choose a_{81}, etc.\n\nIn my earlier plan:\n\nAt turn 80 (τ=0): choose U, so go to y=3 at turn 81.\n\nAt turn 81 (τ=1): we are at y=3, and we choose S, so stay at y=3 for turn 82.\n\nAt turn 82 (τ=2): we are at y=3, choose S, so stay at y=3 for turn 83.\n\nAt turn 83 (τ=3): we are at y=3, choose U, go to y=4 at turn 84.\n\nAt turn 84 (τ=4): at y=4, choose U, go to y=5 at turn 85.\n\nAt turn 85 (τ=5): at y=5, choose U, go to y=6 at turn 86.\n\nAt turn 86 (τ=6): at y=6, choose U, go to y=7 at turn 87.\n\nAt turn 87 (τ=7): at y=7, choose U, go to y=8 at turn 88.\n\nAt turn 88 (τ=8): at y=8, choose U, go to y=9 at turn 89.\n\nAt turn 89 (τ=9): at y=9, done.\n\nH=9 turns? From τ=0 to τ=9, that's 10 positions, but from start to end.\n\nStart at turn t_1=80, position at turn 80.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we reach turn t_1 + H.\n\nIn this case, from turn 80 to turn 89, that's 10 turns: turns 80 to 89 inclusive is 10 turns, but position at turn 89 is y=9.\n\nTurn indices: turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, but actions.\n\nDefine: at turn T, position y_T.\n\nAction a_T chosen at turn T affects y_{T+1}.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nWe start at T=t_1=80, y=2.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nIn my plan, we reach y=9 at turn 89.\n\nt_1=80, so at turn 80 + H, y=9.\n\nIn this case, turn 89 = 80 + 9, so H=9.\n\nBut is this minimal? We spent two extra turns staying at y=3.\n\nCan we do better?\n\nFor example, at τ=1, instead of staying, could we go down or something? But going down to y=2 might not help.\n\nAt τ=0, if we don't go up, but stay or down, but that would be worse.\n\nAnother idea: go up but skip y=4 when it is occupied.\n\ny=4 occupied at τ=1,2,3, so we need to be at y=4 at τ=4 or later, but not at 1,2,3,10,11,12.\n\nSimilarly, for other y.\n\nBut at τ=2, y=5,6,7,8 are occupied, so we cannot be on those at τ=2.\n\nIn my plan, we are not on them at τ=2, we are at y=3.\n\nNow, to save turns, perhaps we can go directly to y=5 or something.\n\nBut we have to pass through each y, I think, since we can only change by 1 each turn.\n\nUnless we move up faster, but we can only change by 0 or ±1.\n\nSo must go through intermediate y.\n\nAnother point: at τ=2, if we are not on y=4,5,6,7,8, we are safe.\n\nBut we are at y=3, which is safe.\n\nInstead of staying two turns, perhaps we can go to y=4 at a safe time.\n\nThe next safe time for y=4 is τ=4.\n\nBut to be at y=4 at τ=4, we need to arrive there at turn τ=4.\n\nFrom y=2 at τ=0, we need to get to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nThat takes 4 turns, but y increases by 2, so we must have two U and two S or something.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt τ=0, y=2, go S, stay at y=2 for τ=1.\n\nBut at τ=1, y=2: freeway 2, at τ=1, tail -53+3= -50, head -42+3= -39, span [-50,-39], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, we are at y=2, choose U, go to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=3: safe as before.\n\nThen at τ=2, choose U, go to y=4 at τ=3, but τ=3 y=4 unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt τ=1, y=2, choose U to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=3, we cannot go to y=4 at τ=3 unsafe.\n\nSo must stay or go down.\n\nIf we go down, to y=2 at τ=3, then we are worse.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=2 or y=3, then go to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nBut that takes more turns.\n\nFor example:\n\nτ=0: y=2, S, stay at y=2 for τ=1\n\nτ=1: y=2, U, go to y=3 at τ=2\n\nτ=2: y=3, S, stay at y=3 for τ=3? Or if we go U, unsafe to y=4 at τ=3.\n\nSo at τ=2, S, stay at y=3 for τ=3\n\nτ=3: y=3, U, go to y=4 at τ=4\n\nSame as before, but we have an extra stay at y=2, which is worse: we reached y=4 at τ=4 but spent an extra turn at y=2.\n\nIn the first plan, we went directly to y=3 at τ=1, then stayed at y=3 for τ=2 and τ=3, then to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nWith H to reach y=9 at τ=9.\n\nIf we could go faster after τ=4.\n\nBut from y=4 at τ=4, we go up each turn to y=9 at τ=9.\n\nτ=4 to τ=9 is 6 turns: from y=4 to y=9 is 5 steps, so 5 actions: U at τ=4 to y=5 τ=5, U to y=6 τ=6, ..., U to y=9 at τ=9.\n\nYes.\n\nTotal from τ=0 to τ=9, 10 positions, but turns: start turn 80, after 9 actions, at turn 89, y=9.\n\nActions from turn 80 to 88.\n\nTurn 80: action to set y at turn 81\n\n...\n\nTurn 88: action to set y at turn 89.\n\nAt turn 89, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions H=9.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=4 at τ=4, but go up without delay later.\n\nBut later, y=4 is occupied at τ=10,11,12, but we will be past y=4 by τ=5 or so.\n\nIn the sequence above, at τ=4 y=4, τ=5 y=5, etc., up to τ=9 y=9.\n\nτ=10 is later, not issue.\n\nBut we have to ensure that when we go through other freeways, no collision.\n\nFor example, at τ=5, y=5: freeway 5 occupied only at τ=2, so at τ=5, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut at τ=2, we are at y=3, which is fine.\n\nCan we avoid staying two turns?\n\nFor example, at τ=1, instead of staying at y=3, could we go down to y=2? But that seems counterproductive.\n\nAnother idea: since at τ=2, y=5,6,7,8 are occupied, but if we are not on them, fine.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, we need to move up.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=4 at τ=0? But we start at y=2, not possible.\n\nOr at τ=4, but earlier.\n\nThe only problem is y=4 at τ=1,2,3 occupied, so we must be at y=4 at τ>=4, but not at 10,11,12.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5, we must not be at τ=2.\n\nIn the sequence above, we are at y=5 at τ=5>2, safe.\n\nBut we spent τ=1 to τ=3 at y=3, which is 3 turns to increase by 1 (from y=3 to y=4, but we were at y=3 from τ=1 to τ=3, then to y=4 at τ=4, so from τ=1 to τ=4, we are at y=3 or y=4, but y increased slowly.\n\nFrom start: at τ=0 y=2, τ=1 y=3, τ=2 y=3, τ=3 y=3, τ=4 y=4.\n\nSo from τ=1 to τ=3, y=3, three turns at y=3.\n\nWe can reduce that?\n\nFor example, can we be at a different y at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, if we are at y=1 or y=2 or y=3, all safe, since y=1,2,3 only occupied later.\n\ny=1: freeway 1, occupied τ=14-17, not at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut y=1 is below, we are going up.\n\nAt τ=0, we are at y=2.\n\nSuppose at τ=0, we choose S, stay at y=2 for τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, we are at y=2, choose U, go to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, we are at y=3, safe.\n\nNow, at τ=2, we want to go to y=4, but cannot at τ=3 because unsafe.\n\nIf we could go directly to y=5, but not possible.\n\nSo we must stay at y=3 or go down.\n\nBut at τ=2, if we choose S, stay at y=3 for τ=3.\n\nThen at τ=3, go U to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt τ=2, choose D, go to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=2, choose U to y=3 at τ=4.\n\nThen at τ=4, y=3, choose U to y=4 at τ=5.\n\nThen we reach y=4 later, at τ=5, worse.\n\nSo not good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal delay is to stay at y=3 for τ=2 and τ=3, then proceed.\n\nBut in terms of reaching y=4, we can be there at τ=4.\n\nNow, after that, we go up each turn to y=9 at τ=9.\n\nBut τ=9 is turn 89.\n\nCan we reach earlier by going faster in other parts?\n\nFor example, from y=4 to y=9, it takes 5 turns: to y=5 at τ=5, y=6 τ=6, ..., y=9 at τ=9.\n\nBut at τ=5, y=5 is safe, etc.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y=4 earlier than τ=4?\n\nτ=4 is the earliest safe time for y=4, since τ=1,2,3 unsafe.\n\nτ=4 is safe.\n\nSo we must arrive at y=4 at τ=4 or later, but not at 10,11,12.\n\nτ=4 is fine.\n\nNow, from y=2 to y=4, minimum 2 steps: e.g., U,U to go from 2 to 4 in two actions, arriving at y=4 at τ=2.\n\nBut at τ=2, y=4 is occupied, unsafe.\n\nTo arrive at τ=4, we need to take more time.\n\nFor example, with actions: at τ=0, U to y=3 at τ=1\n\nThen at τ=1, S to stay at y=3 for τ=2\n\nAt τ=2, S to stay at y=3 for τ=3\n\nAt τ=3, U to y=4 at τ=4\n\nThat's three actions to go from y=3 to y=4, but we were at y=3 at τ=1.\n\nFrom start: at τ=0 y=2, action U to y=3 τ=1\n\nThen actions at τ=1 and τ=2 are S, so at τ=3 y=3\n\nThen action U at τ=3 to y=4 τ=4\n\nSo from τ=1 to τ=3, y=3, and we used two S actions.\n\nThe distance from y=2 to y=4 is 2, but we took three turns to increase by 2: from τ=0 to τ=4, y from 2 to 4, but at τ=0 y=2, τ=4 y=4, but with intermediate points.\n\nNumber of turns: from turn 80 to turn 84, y from 2 to 4, but we used actions at turn 80,81,82,83 to set positions at 81,82,83,84.\n\nAt turn 80: action to set y at 81\n\nAt turn 81: action to set y at 82\n\nAt turn 82: action to set y at 83\n\nAt turn 83: action to set y at 84\n\nAt turn 84, y=4.\n\nThen similarly to y=9 at turn 89.\n\nTotal actions from turn 80 to 88 for y at 89.\n\nBut H=9 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier by taking a different path, but since we have to avoid the τ=2 on multiple levels, and y=4 occupied early, I think we have to wait.\n\nAnother thing: at τ=2, y=5,6,7,8 are occupied, but if we are not on them, fine, but we need to be on them later.\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=5 at τ=3 or something.\n\nBut to be at y=5, we need to come from y=4 or y=6.\n\nBut at τ=2, we cannot be on y=5.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=4 is τ=4.\n\nThen from y=4 at τ=4, go to y=5 at τ=5, which is after τ=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y=5 earlier? Only if we can reach y=4 earlier, but we can't because of the occupation.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=3 and then directly to y=5, but no, we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo I think 9 turns is the best.\n\nBut let's confirm the occupied times again.\n\nFreeway 4: car2 at τ=1,2,3: at τ=1: tail -15+4= -11? Earlier calculation: tail -15 + sτ, s=4.\n\nτ=1: -15+4= -11, head -4+4=0, so span [-11,0], 0 is included? 0 ≤ 0, yes, so occupied.\n\nτ=2: -15+8= -7, -4+8=4, [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nτ=3: -15+12= -3, -4+12=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nτ=4: car2 not, car1: at τ=10,11,12 only, so at τ=4, car1: tail -51 +4*4= -51+16= -35, head -40+16= -24, span [-35,-24], 0 not in. car2 span would be -15+16=1, head -4+16=12, [1,12], 0 not <=1? 0 <1, so not in. So safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nIn my sequence, we have to go through y=8 to y=9.\n\ny=8 is freeway 8, occupied only at τ=2, so at other times safe.\n\nIn the sequence, at τ=8, y=8, we go to y=9.\n\nBut is there a collision risk elsewhere?\n\nFor example, when we are at y=4 at τ=4, and we go up, but at τ=10, y=4 is occupied, but we are at y=5 or higher by then.\n\nτ=10 is later, at τ=4 we are at y=4, τ=5 y=5, ..., so by τ=10, y=9 or something.\n\nτ=10, y=9 if we go straight, but y=9 safe.\n\nBut we reach y=9 at τ=9, before τ=10.\n\nSimilarly, the later occupations at τ=14-17 for y=1,2,3 are irrelevant.\n\nSo the sequence seems safe.\n\nBut can we save a turn?\n\nFor example, if at some point we can move faster.\n\nAt τ=3, if we are at y=3, and we go to y=4 at τ=4, but y=4 at τ=4 safe.\n\nBut at τ=3, y=3 is safe, but we are not moving.\n\nSuppose at τ=0, we go U to y=3 τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, instead of S, we go D to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, we can go U to y=3 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, go U to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nSame as before, but we went down and up, same number of actions, but we were at y=2 at τ=2, which is lower, but reached y=4 at same time.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nAt τ=2, after being at y=2, we could go directly to y=4? No.\n\nSo I think minimal H is 9.\n\nBut let's think about the actions.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps we can go to y=1 or something, but y=1 is below, not helpful.\n\nOr, since at τ=2, y=5 is occupied, but if we are at y=4 at τ=2, unsafe, or y=6, etc.\n\nBut we cannot jump.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=4 at τ=4, but go up faster, but from y=4 to y=9, minimum 5 actions, to y=9 at τ=9 if start from τ=4.\n\nIf we start from y=4 at τ=4, then U at τ=4 to y=5 τ=5, U to y=6 τ=6, U to y=7 τ=7, U to y=8 τ=8, U to y=9 τ=9.\n\nYes.\n\nTo reach y=4 at τ=4 from y=2 at τ=0, we need to cover +2 in y with 4 turns, so net +2, so we must have two U and two other actions, which could be S or D, but D not useful, so two S.\n\nIn the sequence: from τ=0 to τ=4, we have positions: τ=0 y=2, τ=1 y=3 (after U), τ=2 y=3 (after S), τ=3 y=3 (after S), τ=4 y=4 (after U).\n\nActions: at τ=0 U, τ=1 S, τ=2 S, τ=3 U.\n\nThen τ=4 U, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nIf we do U at τ=0, S at τ=1, S at τ=2, U at τ=3 to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nThen U at τ=4 to y=5 τ=5, U τ=5 to y=6 τ=6, U τ=6 to y=7 τ=7, U τ=7 to y=8 τ=8, U τ=8 to y=9 τ=9.\n\nNow, at τ=8, y=8, is it safe? Freeway 8 occupied only at τ=2, so at τ=8, should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut in this, we have actions from τ=0 to τ=8, that's 9 actions: τ=0 to 8 inclusive is 9 actions.\n\nτ from 0 to 8: actions at t=80 to t=88, setting y at t=81 to t=89.\n\nAt t=89, y=9.\n\nH=9.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence of actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to specify for each turn.\n\nAlso, for freeway 4, at τ=10,11,12 occupied, but we are past by then.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at τ=9, we are at y=9, but we don't need to act, we are already there.\n\nBut the actions are up to reaching.\n\nNow, but let's list the actions step by step.\n\nTurn t_1 = 80: player at (0,2)\n\nChoose action a_80.\n\nIf a_80 = U, then y at turn 81 is 3.\n\nThen at turn 81, position y=3, choose a_81.\n\nIn plan: a_81 = S, so y at turn 82 is 3.\n\nThen at turn 82, position y=3, choose a_82 = S, so y at turn 83 is 3.\n\nThen at turn 83, position y=3, choose a_83 = U, so y at turn 84 is 4.\n\nThen at turn 84, position y=4, choose a_84 = U, so y at turn 85 is 5.\n\na_84 = U, y_{85} =5\n\nThen turn 85, y=5, a_85=U, y_{86}=6\n\nTurn 86, y=6, a_86=U, y_{87}=7\n\nTurn 87, y=7, a_87=U, y_{88}=8\n\nTurn 88, y=8, a_88=U, y_{89}=9\n\nThen at turn 89, y=9, done.\n\nH=9 actions: from turn 80 to 88.\n\nNow, but we have to make sure that at each position, no collision.\n\nAt turn 81 (τ=1), y=3: freeway 3, at τ=1, tail -53 +3*1= -50, head -42+3= -39, span [-50,-39], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 82 (τ=2), y=3: freeway 3, τ=2, tail -53+6= -47, head -42+6= -36, span [-47,-36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 83 (τ=3), y=3: same, τ=3, tail -53+9= -44, head -42+9= -33, span [-44,-33], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 84 (τ=4), y=4: freeway 4, at τ=4, as before, no car at x=0, safe.\n\nTurn 85 (τ=5), y=5: freeway 5, at τ=5, occupied only at τ=2, so safe. Specifically, car1: tail -35 +12*5= -35+60=25, head -24+60=36, span [25,36], 0 not in. car2: tail13+60=73, head24+60=84, [73,84], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, turn 86 (τ=6), y=6: similar, safe.\n\nTurn 87 (τ=7), y=7: safe.\n\nTurn 88 (τ=8), y=8: freeway 8, at τ=8, car1: tail -35 +12*8= -35+96=61, head -24+96=72, [61,72], 0 not in. car2: 13+96=109, 24+96=120, [109,120], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nThen turn 89, y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nNow, all good.\n\nBut is there a way with H=8?\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at turn 88.\n\nThat would require from turn 80 y=2 to turn 88 y=9, in 8 turns, so net +7, so we need 7 U and possibly one S or D, but since we need to increase by 7, with 8 actions, we must have 7 U and one other, which could be S or D.\n\nIf we have a S, we stay at some y, which might help avoid collision.\n\nFor example, to be at y=4 at τ=4, but with fewer actions? From start, to reach y=4 at τ=4, we need 4 actions: as above.\n\nIf we can reach y=4 earlier, but cannot because occupied.\n\nSuppose we go to y=3 at τ=1, then at τ=1, instead of S, we go U to y=4 at τ=2, but unsafe.\n\nGo to y=5 at τ=3? But to be at y=5 at τ=3, we need to be at y=4 at τ=2 or y=6, but y=4 at τ=2 unsafe, y=6 at τ=2 unsafe.\n\nAt τ=2, y=5 is occupied, so if we are at y=5 at τ=2, collision.\n\nSimilarly, cannot.\n\nSo I think impossible to be at y=4 before τ=4 safely.\n\nThus minimal H=9.\n\nNow, for the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, we have two S actions at turn 81 and 82.\n\nBut turn 81 and 82 both S.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nAlso, we need to output the actions starting from t_1.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: S\n\nTurn 82: S\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nThen at turn 89, y=9.\n\nActions from turn 80 to 88, 9 actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nFirst, current turn t_1=80.\n\nPlayer at (0,2)\n\nAction a_80 = U, so to (0,3) at turn 81.\n\nThen at turn 81, a_81 = S, stay at (0,3) for turn 82.\n\nThen turn 82, a_82 = S, stay at (0,3) for turn 83.\n\nThen turn 83, a_83 = U, to (0,4) at turn 84.\n\nThen turn 84, a_84 = U, to (0,5) at turn 85.\n\nThen turn 85, a_85 = U, to (0,6) at turn 86.\n\nThen turn 86, a_86 = U, to (0,7) at turn 87.\n\nThen turn 87, a_87 = U, to (0,8) at turn 88.\n\nThen turn 88, a_88 = U, to (0,9) at turn 89.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for the car on freeway 4, there is a car at τ=10,11,12, but we are past.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut in the beginning, at τ=0, we could have stayed, but it would take longer.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nNow, the answer should be in the box.\n\nSo the sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: S\n\nTurn 82: S\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nIn the format.\n\nBut the player reaches (0,9) at turn 89, which is after 9 actions.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can start with S at turn 80, but then we stay at y=2 for τ=1, then we need to go up, but we might reach later.\n\nFor example, if S at 80, stay at y=2 for turn 81.\n\nThen at turn 81, U to y=3 at turn 82.\n\nThen at turn 82, S to stay at y=3 for turn 83? Or U, but to y=4 at turn 83 unsafe.\n\nSo S at turn 82 to stay y=3 for turn 83.\n\nThen U at turn 83 to y=4 at turn 84.\n\nSame as before, but we started later: reached y=4 at turn 84, same as above, but we had an extra S at turn 80, so reached y=9 at turn 89 still? Let's see.\n\nTurn 80: S, y at 81:2\n\nTurn 81: U, y at 82:3\n\nTurn 82: S, y at 83:3\n\nTurn 83: U, y at 84:4\n\nThen same as before from turn 84: U to y=5 at 85, ..., to y=9 at 89.\n\nBut now actions from turn 80 to 88, same H=9, but we are at y=2 for longer, but reached at same time.\n\nIn this case, at turn 89 y=9, same.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have S at 80, which is not necessary, but H same.\n\nBut in the first sequence, we moved up immediately, which is better in the sense that we are higher earlier, but for min H, same.\n\nBut in this case, with S at 80, we are at y=2 at turn 81, which is safe, but we could have been at y=3.\n\nBut H is same.\n\nSo both have H=9.\n\nBut the first sequence has U at 80, which is fine.\n\nI think we should use the first one.\n\nSo back to the sequence.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 4 has three cars, but we handled.\n\nI think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) on turn 80 and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The car positions and movements are calculated based on their initial state at turn 80 and their speeds and directions.\n\n### Key Constraints:\n- **Freeway 4** is occupied at x=0 at turns relative to start (τ = T - 80): τ=1, 2, 3 (due to car2) and τ=10, 11, 12 (due to car1). Thus, the player cannot be on y=4 at turns 81, 82, 83, 90, 91, 92 (absolute turns 81, 82, 83, 90, 91, 92).\n- **Freeways 5, 6, 7, and 8** are occupied at x=0 only at τ=2 (absolute turn 82). Thus, the player cannot be on y=5, 6, 7, or 8 at turn 82.\n- **Freeways 1, 2, and 3** are occupied at τ=14, 15, 16, 17 (turns 94, 95, 96, 97), but the player can reach y=9 before these turns, so they are not a concern.\n\nThe minimal path requires 9 turns (H=9), with the player reaching (0, 9) at turn 89. The sequence involves:\n- Moving up to y=3 at turn 81.\n- Staying at y=3 for turns 82 and 83 to avoid the unsafe conditions on y=4 at turns 82 and 83, and on y=5-8 at turn 82.\n- Moving up to y=4 at turn 84, which is safe since τ=4 is not occupied.\n- Moving up directly to y=9 from turns 84 to 89, as all intermediate freeways are safe after τ=2.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 80**: Move up (U) to reach y=3 at turn 81. (y=2 is safe at turn 80.)\n- **Turn 81**: Stay (S) to remain at y=3 for turn 82. (y=3 is safe at turn 81 and 82.)\n- **Turn 82**: Stay (S) to remain at y=3 for turn 83. (y=3 is safe at turn 82 and 83; moving to y=4 would be unsafe at turn 83.)\n- **Turn 83**: Move up (U) to reach y=4 at turn 84. (y=4 is safe at turn 84.)\n- **Turn 84**: Move up (U) to reach y=5 at turn 85. (y=5 is safe at turn 85, as τ=5 ≠ 2.)\n- **Turn 85**: Move up (U) to reach y=6 at turn 86. (y=6 is safe at turn 86.)\n- **Turn 86**: Move up (U) to reach y=7 at turn 87. (y=7 is safe at turn 87.)\n- **Turn 87**: Move up (U) to reach y=8 at turn 88. (y=8 is safe at turn 88.)\n- **Turn 88**: Move up (U) to reach y=9 at turn 89. (y=9 has no cars and is safe.)\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and reaches (0, 9) in 9 turns, which is minimal given the constraints.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 80: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 81: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 82: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 83: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 84: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: \\, U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a particular row at a particular turn, I don't collide with any car on that row at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. The cars are on freeways 1 through 8, each with their positions and speeds given at turn t_1 = 82. The direction tells us if they're moving left or right. Since the x-axis isn't specified beyond the spans, I think we only care about when the car spans include x=0, because that's where the collision happens.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, for the row y_T that I'm on, there is a car on that row with 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nAlso, important: when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn. So if at turn T I move from y to y+1, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1. So for collision, at turn T, I check the row I'm currently on, which is y_T, for any car with 0 in span at T.\n\nNow, the player position is updated: I start at (0,3) at turn t_1=82. I need to reach (0,9) at some turn, meaning y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top row, and there are no cars on y=9 since cars are only on y=1 to 8. So once I reach y=9, I'm safe, and I don't need to worry about cars there.\n\nBut I have to get to y=9 from y=3.\n\nThe actions are U (up, y increases by 1), D (down, y decreases by 1), S (stay, y same). y must stay within 0 to 9.\n\nSince I need to go up to 9, and I'm at 3, going down doesn't make sense, so I should only go up or stay, I think. But sometimes staying might be necessary to avoid a car.\n\nBut in terms of minimal turns, since I need to go up 6 steps (from 3 to 9 is 6), the minimum H would be 6 if I can go up every turn without collision.\n\nBut I have to check if that's possible given the cars.\n\nFirst, let's list the cars for each row at turn t_1=82.\n\nFreeway k means row y=k.\n\nSo for row 1: one car, (-36,-47, right, 3). Head h=-36, tail tau=-47? That seems odd because usually head should be greater than tail if moving right, but let's see the update.\n\nFor right-moving cars: span at T is [tau + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nAt t_1, for row 1: head h=-36, tail tau=-47, direction right, speed 3.\n\nBut if it's right-moving, and head is at -36, tail at -47, that means tail is more negative, so the car is from -47 to -36? But -47 is less than -36, so the span is from left to right, I think.\n\nLet's interpret the span.\n\nThe notation says: for right-moving, span at t_1 is [tau, h], and at T, [tau + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nHere at t_1, span is [tau, h] = [-47, -36] for row 1? But -47 to -36, with h=-36 and tau=-47, so h is the head, which should be the front.\n\nFor right-moving, front is at higher x, so if h=-36 and tau=-47, since -36 > -47, so head is at -36, tail at -47, so the car occupies from x=-47 to x=-36.\n\nThen at time T, since moving right, position becomes [tau + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-47 + s(T-t_1), -36 + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving except for row 4, but let's see.\n\nFirst, row 1: cars: only one, (-36,-47,right,3)\n\nSo at t_1=82, span: [tau, h] = [-47, -36]? No.\n\nThe table says \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor row 1: head h=-36, tail tau=-47, direction right, speed 3.\n\nFor a right-moving car, if head is at h and tail at tau, with h > tau, then the span is [tau, h] from left to right.\n\nHere h=-36, tau=-47, since -36 > -47, so span at t_1 is [-47, -36].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, tau] with h < tau or something, but here all are right-moving I think.\n\nRow 4 has multiple cars, but all right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nIn row 4, it has three cars: (-32,-43,right,4), (4,-7,right,4), (40,29,right,4)\n\nFor (40,29,right,4): head=40, tail=29, so since 40>29, span [29,40]\n\nSimilarly, (4,-7,right,4): head=4, tail=-7, span [-7,4]\n\n(-32,-43,right,4): head=-32, tail=-43, span [-43,-32]\n\nNow for row 5,6,7,8: each has two cars: (0,-11,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nFor (0,-11,right,12): head=0, tail=-11, so span [-11,0] at t_1.\n\n(48,37,right,12): head=48, tail=37, span [37,48]\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, for the row I'm on, 0 is in the span of any car on that row at turn T.\n\nThat is, if there is a car where min_span <= 0 <= max_span for that car at time T.\n\nNow, I need to find when 0 is covered for each row over time.\n\nSince the cars move, the spans change with time.\n\nLet t be turns from t_1, so at time t_1 + t, with t=0 being current.\n\nSet τ = T - t_1, so τ is the offset from current turn.\n\nFor a car, at time t_1 + τ, for a right-moving car with speed s, span is [tau + s τ, h + s τ]\n\nSimilarly for left, but all right here.\n\nSo for row 1: car: tau = -47, h = -36, s=3\n\nSpan at τ: [ -47 + 3τ, -36 + 3τ ]\n\n0 is in span if -47 + 3τ <= 0 <= -36 + 3τ\n\nThat is, -47 + 3τ <= 0 and 0 <= -36 + 3τ\n\nFrom first: 3τ <= 47, τ <= 47/3 ≈ 15.666, so τ <= 15\n\nFrom second: 0 <= -36 + 3τ, so 3τ >= 36, τ >= 12\n\nSo for row 1, 0 is covered when 12 <= τ <= 15\n\nτ is offset, so at turns t_1+12 to t_1+15.\n\nSimilarly, for row 2: same as row 1, (-36,-47,right,3), so same as above, covered at τ=12 to 15.\n\nRow 3: same, covered τ=12 to 15.\n\nNow row 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-32,-43,right,4), tau=-43, h=-32, s=4\n\nSpan at τ: [ -43 + 4τ, -32 + 4τ ]\n\n0 in span: -43 + 4τ <= 0 <= -32 + 4τ\n\nSo -43 + 4τ <= 0 => 4τ <= 43 => τ <= 10.75, so τ <= 10\n\nAnd 0 <= -32 + 4τ => 4τ >= 32 => τ >= 8\n\nSo τ=8 to 10\n\nSecond car: (4,-7,right,4), tau=-7, h=4, s=4\n\nSpan: [ -7 + 4τ, 4 + 4τ ]\n\n0 in span: -7 + 4τ <= 0 <= 4 + 4τ\n\nFirst: -7 + 4τ <= 0 => 4τ <= 7 => τ <= 1.75, τ <=1\n\nSecond: 0 <= 4 + 4τ, which is always true since 4τ >=0 for τ>=0.\n\n0 <= 4 + 4τ, since 4+4τ >=4>0, always true for τ>=0.\n\nSo only -7 + 4τ <= 0, so τ <= 1.75, so τ <=1\n\nThus for this car, 0 covered when τ <=1\n\nThird car: (40,29,right,4), tau=29, h=40, s=4\n\nSpan: [29 + 4τ, 40 + 4τ]\n\n0 in span: 29+4τ <= 0 <= 40+4τ\n\nBut 29+4τ >=29>0, so 0 <= 40+4τ always true, but 29+4τ <=0? 29+4τ >=29>0, so never <=0, so 0 never in span for this car.\n\nSo for row 4, the cars that cover 0: first car at τ=8 to10, second car at τ<=1.\n\nSo overall, for row 4, 0 is covered when τ<=1 or τ=8 to10.\n\nNow row 5: cars: (0,-11,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (0,-11,right,12), head=0, tail=-11, s=12\n\nSpan at τ: [ -11 + 12τ, 0 + 12τ ] = [ -11 + 12τ, 12τ ]\n\n0 in span: min <=0 <= max\n\n-11 + 12τ <= 0 <= 12τ\n\nFirst: -11 + 12τ <=0 => 12τ <=11 => τ <= 11/12 ≈ 0.916, so τ <=0 since τ integer? τ is turn offset, so integer.\n\nτ >=0, integer.\n\nSo -11 + 12τ <=0 for τ <=0? At τ=0, -11 +0 = -11 <=0 true, 0 <=0 true, so at τ=0, 0 is included.\n\nAt τ=1, -11+12=1 <=0? 1 <=0 false, and 0 <=12 true, but min=1, max=12, 0 not in [1,12], so not covered.\n\nSimilarly for τ>1, min larger.\n\nSo for first car, 0 covered only at τ=0.\n\nNow second car: (48,37,right,12), tau=37, h=48, s=12\n\nSpan: [37+12τ, 48+12τ], min=37+12τ >=37>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nThus for row 5, 0 covered only at τ=0 by the first car.\n\nSimilarly for row 6: same cars, so 0 covered only at τ=0.\n\nRow 7: same, τ=0.\n\nRow 8: same, τ=0.\n\nNow, row 1,2,3: covered τ=12 to15\n\nRow 4: covered τ<=1 or τ=8 to10\n\nRow 5,6,7,8: covered only at τ=0\n\nI need to go from y=3 to y=9.\n\nStart at τ=0, position y=3.\n\nAt each turn τ, I choose action to go up, down, or stay.\n\nBut since I need to go up, down might not help, so probably only U or S.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal steps are 6 if I can go up every turn.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on a row when 0 is covered for that row at that τ.\n\nAlso, at τ=0, I am at y=3.\n\nNow, for y=3, row 3, when is 0 covered? From above, row 3 covered at τ=12 to15.\n\nAt τ=0, is row 3 covered? At τ=0, for row 3, car: same as row1, span at τ=0: [-47,-36], min=-47<0, max=-36<0? -36<0, so 0 not in [-47,-36], since both negative, 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, row 3 covered only from τ=12 to15.\n\nAt τ=0, for row 3, not covered.\n\nSimilarly, row 5,6,7,8 covered at τ=0.\n\nBut at τ=0, I am on row 3, not on row 5,6,7,8.\n\nCollision only if I am on the row when 0 covered.\n\nAt turn τ, I am on row y_τ.\n\nFor row y_τ, at time τ (offset), if 0 covered, collision.\n\nNow at τ=0, I am on row 3.\n\nRow 3: at τ=0, not covered, as above.\n\nSo safe.\n\nIf I go up to y=4 at τ=1.\n\nBut let's first see if I can go up directly.\n\nSuppose I go U every turn from τ=0 to τ=5: actions at t=82,83,84,85,86,87.\n\nLet's define the turns:\n\nAt turn t_1 + τ, for τ=0,1,2,...\n\nPosition: start at τ=0, y=3.\n\nAfter action, y changes for next turn.\n\nAt turn T = t_1 + τ, I am at position y_τ.\n\nI choose action a_τ, which determines y_{τ+1} for turn T+1.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, and I choose a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the cars on row y_T at time T.\n\nNow, for row y, we have the coverage times.\n\nLet me list for each row, the τ when 0 is covered (unsafe).\n\nRow 1: unsafe τ=12,13,14,15\n\nRow 2: same, τ=12-15\n\nRow 3: same, τ=12-15\n\nRow 4: unsafe when τ<=1 or τ=8,9,10\n\nτ<=1 means τ=0 and τ=1? τ integer, so τ=0,1 and τ=8,9,10\n\nRow 5: unsafe only τ=0\n\nSimilarly row 6: τ=0\n\nRow 7: τ=0\n\nRow 8: τ=0\n\nRow 9: no cars, always safe.\n\nI start at τ=0, y=3.\n\nAt τ=0, y=3, row 3 is safe at τ=0 (not unsafe), so no collision.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9 by some τ.\n\nMinimal τ would be 5 if I go up every turn: after 5 ups, I reach y=8 at τ=5? Let's see:\n\nAt τ=0: y=3\n\nAfter action a_0, at turn τ=1, y= y_0 + Δy_0\n\nAt turn τ=0, I choose a_0, then at turn τ=1, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo positions: at turn τ, y_τ.\n\nStart: τ=0, y_0 = 3\n\nAfter action a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\n...\n\nAt turn τ, position y_τ.\n\nI reach y=9 when y_τ =9 for some τ.\n\nSince I start at y=3, to reach y=9, I need to increase y by 6, so minimum 6 actions of U, but since each U increases y by 1, and I can have S, but S doesn't help to progress, so minimal turns to reach is 6, if I go U every turn without collision.\n\nNow, let's simulate going up every turn.\n\nAssume actions: for τ from 0 to 5, I choose U, so y increases from 3 to 4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\ny_τ at turn τ:\n\nτ=0: y=3\n\nAfter U, at τ=1, y=4\n\nAfter U, at τ=2, y=5\n\nAfter U, at τ=3, y=6\n\nAfter U, at τ=4, y=7\n\nAfter U, at τ=5, y=8\n\nAfter U, at τ=6, y=9\n\nAt τ=6, y=9, which is safe.\n\nBut I need to check for each turn τ from 0 to 5, whether at that turn, on row y_τ, it is safe.\n\nAt τ=0: y=3, row 3 unsafe only at τ=12-15, not at τ=0, so safe.\n\nAt τ=1: y=4, row 4.\n\nRow 4 unsafe at τ<=1 or τ=8,9,10.\n\nτ=1 <=1, so unsafe. Collision if I am on row 4 at τ=1.\n\nIn this sequence, at τ=1, y=4, so I would be on row 4 at turn t_1+1, and since τ=1 <=1, unsafe, collision.\n\nCannot go to row 4 at τ=1.\n\nSo going directly up at τ=0 to y=4 at τ=1 causes collision at τ=1.\n\nTherefore, I need to avoid row 4 at τ=1.\n\nNow, row 4 is also unsafe at τ=0, but at τ=0 I am on row 3, not row 4.\n\nAt τ=0, I am on row 3, safe.\n\nNow, to go up, I need to go to row 4 at some point.\n\nBut row 4 unsafe at τ=0,1 and τ=8,9,10.\n\nτ=0 and τ=1 are unsafe, but other times might be safe.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nI could stay on row 3 for a while or go to other rows.\n\nBut I need to reach row 9.\n\nSince row 4 is unsafe at τ=0 and τ=1, I need to go to row 4 at a safe time, like τ=2 to7 or after, but row 4 unsafe only at τ=0,1,8,9,10, so safe for τ=2 to7 and τ>=11.\n\nSimilarly, row 5,6,7,8 unsafe only at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, they are unsafe, but since I start at row 3, not on them, so at τ=0, no issue.\n\nBut if I go to row 4 at τ=1, it is unsafe.\n\nSo for row 4, I should not be there at τ=0 or τ=1 or τ=8,9,10.\n\nBut at τ=0, I am not on row 4 anyway.\n\nNow, minimal path: I need to go from y=3 to y=4, but not at τ=1.\n\nI could stay on row 3 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, if I stay, y=3 still.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=3, row 3 unsafe? At τ=1, row 3 unsafe only from τ=12-15, not at τ=1, so safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, I can go to row 4.\n\nAt τ=2, row 4: unsafe only at τ=0,1,8,9,10, so τ=2 is safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nLet's see.\n\nSequence:\n\nStart τ=0: at y=3, choose action for next.\n\nTo avoid row 4 at τ=1, at τ=0, I should not go up, so I stay or go down, but down to y=2 might not help.\n\nSo at τ=0, choose S (stay), so at τ=1, still y=3.\n\nThen at τ=1, I am on row 3, which is safe (not unsafe at τ=1).\n\nThen I choose U, so to y=4 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=4, row 4 is safe since τ=2 not in unsafe times.\n\nThen I can go up from there.\n\nBut I need to go to higher rows.\n\nNow, row 5 to 8 are unsafe only at τ=0, but τ=0 is past, so for τ>=1, they are safe, since only unsafe at τ=0.\n\nRow 5: unsafe only τ=0, so for τ>=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly row 6,7,8 same.\n\nRow 9 always safe.\n\nNow, from above, at τ=2, I can be at y=4.\n\nThen I go U to y=5 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=5, row 5 safe since τ=3>0.\n\nThen U to y=6 at τ=4, row 6 safe.\n\nU to y=7 at τ=5, row 7 safe.\n\nU to y=8 at τ=6, row 8 safe (τ=6>0).\n\nU to y=9 at τ=7.\n\nAt τ=7, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, what about the actions: I need to specify actions at each turn.\n\nTurn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nH is number of turns, from start to when I reach y=9.\n\nAt turn τ, I reach y=9, so for that turn, y_τ=9.\n\nIn the sequence, when I first reach y=9.\n\nIn the above, I start at τ=0, y=3.\n\nAfter actions:\n\nAt τ=0: I choose S (stay), so at τ=1, y=3\n\nAt τ=1: I choose U, so at τ=2, y=4\n\nAt τ=2: choose U, at τ=3, y=5\n\nAt τ=3: U, at τ=4, y=6\n\nAt τ=4: U, at τ=5, y=7\n\nAt τ=5: U, at τ=6, y=8\n\nAt τ=6: U, at τ=7, y=9\n\nSo at τ=7, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, I used 7 turns: from τ=0 to τ=6 actions, reaching at τ=7.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nEarlier I thought min 6, but I had to stay one turn.\n\nCan I do with 6 turns?\n\nMinimal is 6, but at τ=1, if I go to row 4, it is unsafe.\n\nBut row 4 is unsafe only at τ=0,1,8,9,10.\n\nτ=2 to7 are safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9 in 6 turns, I need to be at y=9 by τ=6.\n\nFrom y=3 to y=9 in 6 steps: after 6 actions, y should be 9.\n\nAt turn τ=6, y=9.\n\nBut at τ=6, y=9 is fine.\n\nNow, the path: start τ=0, y=3.\n\nAfter 6 actions, at τ=6, y=9.\n\nThe positions at each turn τ must be safe.\n\nFor example, if I go U at τ=0, to y=4 at τ=1.\n\nBut at τ=1, y=4, unsafe.\n\nIf I go to another row.\n\nBut rows above might be safe except at τ=0.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, if I go up to y=4 at τ=1, but unsafe.\n\nIf I go down? To y=2, but that might not help and take more turns.\n\ny=2 is row 2, which has cars.\n\nRow 2 unsafe at τ=12-15, but at τ=0, safe? Row 2 same as row1, at τ=0, span [-47,-36], not cover 0, safe.\n\nBut if I go down to y=2 at τ=1, then I am at y=2 at τ=1, which is safe, but then I have to go up later, which might take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nSimilarly, other ways.\n\nPerhaps I can go up at a different time.\n\nBut since row 4 is only unsafe at τ=0,1, and I need to pass through row 4, I have to do it when safe, like at τ=2.\n\nBut to reach y=9 by τ=6, I need to start moving up.\n\nSuppose at τ=0, I go U, to y=4 at τ=1, but unsafe, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt τ=0, I stay, then at τ=1, I go U to y=4 at τ=2, as before.\n\nThen I can go up to y=5 at τ=3, y=6 at τ=4, y=7 at τ=5, y=8 at τ=6, but at τ=6, y=8, not y=9 yet.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need one more action: at τ=6, go U to y=9 at τ=7.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt τ=5, if I am at y=7, I can go U to y=8 at τ=6, then U to y=9 at τ=7.\n\nStill 7 turns.\n\nBut can I be faster?\n\nSuppose I go to row 5 directly or something.\n\nBut to go to row 5, I need to be on row 4 first or row 6, but rows are adjacent.\n\nI can only move to adjacent rows.\n\ny changes by -1,0,1.\n\nSo from y=3, I can only go to y=2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I have to go through row 4.\n\nAnd row 4 must be visited at a safe time, not τ=0,1,8,9,10.\n\nIn minimal path, I should go at τ=2 or later.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 in fewer than 7 turns? 6 turns would require reaching y=9 at τ=6.\n\nThat means from τ=0 to τ=5, I need to have increased y by 6, so all actions U, no S.\n\nBut with all U: τ=0 U to y=4 at τ=1 → unsafe at τ=1.\n\nIf I start by staying or down, I lose a turn.\n\nSo impossible to do in 6 turns without collision.\n\nThus minimal H is 7.\n\nNow, in the sequence above, I have 7 actions: from τ=0 to τ=6, with actions: S, U, U, U, U, U, U\n\nReaching y=9 at τ=7.\n\nNow, but I need to check if at any point I am on a row when unsafe.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt τ=0: y=3, row 3 safe (unsafe only τ=12-15)\n\nAt τ=1: y=3 (since I stayed at τ=0), row 3 safe\n\nAt τ=2: y=4, row 4: τ=2 not unsafe, safe\n\nAt τ=3: y=5, row 5: unsafe only τ=0, so τ=3>0 safe\n\nAt τ=4: y=6, row 6: unsafe only τ=0, safe\n\nAt τ=5: y=7, row 7: unsafe only τ=0, safe\n\nAt τ=6: y=8, row 8: unsafe only τ=0, safe\n\nAt τ=7: y=9, row 9 no cars, safe.\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, but row 4 has unsafe at τ=8,9,10, but in this path, I am on row 4 at τ=2, which is fine, and by τ=3 I am gone.\n\nSimilarly, other rows fine.\n\nNow, is there a way with 6 turns? Suppose I skip row 4 or something, but I can't, since adjacent.\n\nPerhaps I can go to row 4 at τ=7 or later, but that would be slower, not faster.\n\nτ=7 is later than τ=2.\n\nSo 7 turns seem minimal.\n\nBut H is the number of actions, I think.\n\nIn the answer, H is the minimal number of turns, and the sequence of actions for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, from turn t_1 + 0 to t_1 + 6, that is 7 actions.\n\nReaching at turn t_1 + 7, but after H actions, I should be at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, after actions at t_1 to t_1+6, at turn t_1+7, y=9.\n\nThe last action is at t_1+6, leading to y=9 at t_1+7.\n\nH should be such that after H actions, position is at (0,9).\n\nStart at turn t_1, position (0,y) with y=3.\n\nAfter first action at t_1, position at t_1+1.\n\nAfter H actions, position at t_1 + H.\n\nWe want at t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, with H actions, we reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nIn my sequence: actions at t_1 (τ=0), t_1+1 (τ=1), ..., up to t_1+6 (τ=6), so 7 actions, H=7.\n\nAt turn t_1+7, y=9.\n\nNow, for the sequence: actions for turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to 6.\n\nActions: at t=0: S (since stay at y=3)\n\nIn terms of the action: at turn T, I choose a_T, which affects y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn t_1, I choose a_{t_1}, then y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy\n\nIn this case, at turn t_1, I choose S, so Δy=0, so y_{t_1+1} = 3\n\nThen at turn t_1+1, I choose U, so y_{t_1+2} = 4\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nTurn t_1: action S\n\nTurn t_1+1: action U\n\nTurn t_1+2: U\n\nTurn t_1+3: U\n\nTurn t_1+4: U\n\nTurn t_1+5: U\n\nTurn t_1+6: U\n\nThen at turn t_1+7, y=9.\n\nWith H=7 actions.\n\nNow, but I think I can do better by not staying.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 5-8 are safe after τ=0, I could go directly to them if possible, but I have to go through row 4.\n\nAt τ=0, if I go up, to y=4 at τ=1, but unsafe.\n\nUnless I can be on row 4 at a different time.\n\nBut τ=1 is fixed unsafe.\n\nPerhaps I can go down first, but that seems worse.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, go down to y=2 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=2, row 2: unsafe only τ=12-15, not now, so safe.\n\nBut then I need to go up to y=3 or y=4.\n\nBut y=3 at τ=2, then to y=4 at τ=3, etc., but it would take more turns, like to go from y=2 to y=9, need 7 steps, but with down first, I start at y=3, go down to y=2, then later up, so more than 7 actions.\n\nFor example: τ=0: D to y=2 at τ=1\n\nτ=1: at y=2, then U to y=3 at τ=2\n\nτ=2: at y=3, then U to y=4 at τ=3\n\nThen same as before but delayed.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, the sequence with one stay is fine.\n\nBut in my sequence, I have S at the beginning, then all U.\n\nBut I could have the stay later, but that might not help.\n\nFor example, if I go up at τ=0 to y=4 at τ=1, unsafe, impossible.\n\nSo must avoid row 4 at τ=1.\n\nThus, minimal H=7.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, I have actions from t_1 to t_1+6.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut let me confirm the car for row 4 at τ=2.\n\nRow 4: at τ=2, cars:\n\nFirst car: span [ -43 + 4*2, -32 + 4*2] = [ -43+8, -32+8] = [-35, -24], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [ -7 + 4*2, 4 + 4*2] = [-7+8, 4+8] = [1,12], min=1>0, 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [29+8,40+8]=[37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, other points.\n\nNow, what about row 8 at τ=6: row 8 unsafe only at τ=0, at τ=6, cars: first car (0,-11,right,12) span at τ: [ -11 +12τ, 12τ ]\n\nAt τ=6, [-11+72, 72] = [61,72], not cover 0.\n\nSecond car [37+72,48+72]=[109,120], not.\n\nSo safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn t_1: S\n\nTurn t_1+1: U\n\nTurn t_1+2: U\n\nTurn t_1+3: U\n\nTurn t_1+4: U\n\nTurn t_1+5: U\n\nTurn t_1+6: U\n\nH=7.\n\nBut t_1=82, so:\n\nTurn 82: S\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nThen at turn 89, y=9.\n\nNow, the answer format should be in terms of t_1.\n\nBut in the box, it should be with t_1.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for row 4, there is a car at (4,-7,right,4), which at τ=0: span [-7,4], which includes 0? min=-7, max=4, so -7<=0<=4, yes, covers 0 at τ=0.\n\nBut at τ=0, I am not on row 4.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=1, for row 4, first car span [ -43+4, -32+4] = [-39,-28], not cover 0.\n\nSecond car: [ -7+4, 4+4] = [-3,8], min=-3<=0, max=8>=0, so 0 covered at τ=1.\n\nYes, as I had.\n\nAnd at τ=2, as above, not covered.\n\nSo fine.\n\nNow, I think that's the minimal.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and in this case H=7.\n\nBut is there a way with H=6?\n\nSuppose I go to row 5 directly, but I can't, because from y=3, I can only go to y=2,3,4.\n\nUnless I move multiple steps, but each action only changes by 1.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can stay on a row and move later, but that increases H.\n\nSo I think H=7 is minimal.\n\nThus, the sequence:\n\nActions:\n\nAt turn t_1: S\n\nAt turn t_1+1: U\n\nAt turn t_1+2: U\n\nAt turn t_1+3: U\n\nAt turn t_1+4: U\n\nAt turn t_1+5: U\n\nAt turn t_1+6: U\n\nIn the sequence, for t from 0 to H-1, which is 0 to 6.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut in the car list, for row 5,6,7,8, there is a car at (0,-11,right,12), which at τ=0, head=0, tail=-11, so at τ=0, span [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nBut since I am not on those rows at τ=0, fine.\n\nIn my sequence, I never on row 5-8 at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=3, on row 5, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think correct.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 82\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs if, at turn \\(T\\), the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) and there is a car on that freeway such that \\(0\\) is within its span at turn \\(T\\).\n\n### Car Coverage Analysis\nThe times when \\(0\\) is covered (unsafe) for each freeway, relative to turn offset \\(\\tau = T - t_1\\), are:\n- Freeway 1: unsafe at \\(\\tau = 12, 13, 14, 15\\)\n- Freeway 2: unsafe at \\(\\tau = 12, 13, 14, 15\\)\n- Freeway 3: unsafe at \\(\\tau = 12, 13, 14, 15\\)\n- Freeway 4: unsafe at \\(\\tau = 0, 1, 8, 9, 10\\)\n- Freeway 5: unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 0\\)\n- Freeway 6: unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 0\\)\n- Freeway 7: unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 0\\)\n- Freeway 8: unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 0\\)\n- Freeway 9: always safe (no cars)\n\n### Minimal Path and Collision Avoidance\n- The player starts at \\((0, 3)\\) at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn \\(t_1 = 82\\)).\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 3\\), at least 6 upward moves are required, but a direct upward path causes a collision:\n  - At \\(\\tau = 0\\), if the player moves up (U), they would be at \\(y = 4\\) at \\(\\tau = 1\\).\n  - Freeway 4 is unsafe at \\(\\tau = 1\\), leading to a collision.\n- Thus, the player must stay (S) at \\(y = 3\\) for one turn to avoid being on freeway 4 at \\(\\tau = 1\\).\n- After staying at \\(\\tau = 0\\), the player can move upward from \\(\\tau = 1\\) onwards:\n  - At \\(\\tau = 1\\), the player is at \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as freeway 3 is not unsafe at \\(\\tau = 1\\)).\n  - At \\(\\tau = 1\\), moving up (U) brings the player to \\(y = 4\\) at \\(\\tau = 2\\).\n  - Freeway 4 is safe at \\(\\tau = 2\\) (not unsafe).\n- From \\(\\tau = 2\\) to \\(\\tau = 6\\), moving up (U) each turn progresses through freeways 5 to 8, all safe for \\(\\tau \\geq 1\\) (since they are only unsafe at \\(\\tau = 0\\)).\n- At \\(\\tau = 7\\), the player reaches \\(y = 9\\), which is always safe.\n\n### Sequence of Actions\n- \\(H = 7\\) turns (actions) are required, from turn \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + 6\\).\n- Actions:\n  - Turn \\(t_1\\) (82): Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 3\\) for turn 83.\n  - Turn \\(t_1 + 1\\) (83): Up (U) to reach \\(y = 4\\) at turn 84.\n  - Turn \\(t_1 + 2\\) (84): Up (U) to reach \\(y = 5\\) at turn 85.\n  - Turn \\(t_1 + 3\\) (85): Up (U) to reach \\(y = 6\\) at turn 86.\n  - Turn \\(t_1 + 4\\) (86): Up (U) to reach \\(y = 7\\) at turn 87.\n  - Turn \\(t_1 + 5\\) (87): Up (U) to reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 88.\n  - Turn \\(t_1 + 6\\) (88): Up (U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 89.\n\n### Verification of Safety\n- \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 82): \\(y = 3\\), freeway 3 safe (unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 12-15\\)).\n- \\(\\tau = 1\\) (turn 83): \\(y = 3\\), freeway 3 safe.\n- \\(\\tau = 2\\) (turn 84): \\(y = 4\\), freeway 4 safe (\\(\\tau = 2\\) not unsafe).\n- \\(\\tau = 3\\) (turn 85): \\(y = 5\\), freeway 5 safe (\\(\\tau = 3 > 0\\)).\n- \\(\\tau = 4\\) (turn 86): \\(y = 6\\), freeway 6 safe (\\(\\tau = 4 > 0\\)).\n- \\(\\tau = 5\\) (turn 87): \\(y = 7\\), freeway 7 safe (\\(\\tau = 5 > 0\\)).\n- \\(\\tau = 6\\) (turn 88): \\(y = 8\\), freeway 8 safe (\\(\\tau = 6 > 0\\)).\n- \\(\\tau = 7\\) (turn 89): \\(y = 9\\), freeway 9 always safe.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 7\\) turns, which is minimal since \\(H = 6\\) is impossible due to the collision on freeway 4 at \\(\\tau = 1\\) if moving up immediately.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 82: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 83: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 84: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 84, player is at (0,4). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions.\n\n The grid has freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically (y-axis) with actions U (+1), D (-1), S (0). The x-coordinate is always 0 for the player.\n\n Collision: at turn T, if the player is at (0, y_T) and there is a car on freeway y_T that has 0 in its span at turn T, then collision.\n\n Important: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T the player is still on y_T. So at turn T, we check the car on freeway y_T. Only when we are on a freeway at a turn we check for that freeway.\n\n The cars are moving horizontally. The update for a car from turn t1 to T:\n   For a left-moving car: span at T = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n   For a right-moving car: span at T = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n Note: the car state is given at turn t1 (which is 84). We are starting at turn 84.\n\n Our actions will be for turns starting at 84 (t=0 in our sequence) until we reach y=9.\n\n We are at y=4 at turn 84. We need to get to y=9. The minimal number of moves without any cars would be 5 (all U). But we have to avoid cars on freeways 4,5,6,7,8 (since we start at 4 and go up to 9, we will step on freeways 4,5,6,7,8 and then 9 is the goal and there are no cars on y=9? Actually, the freeways are y=1..8, so y=9 is safe? But note: the goal is (0,9) and there are no freeways at y=9 (since freeways are 1-8). So we only care about freeways 4 to 8 during our journey.\n\n However, note that we start at y=4 at turn 84. So at turn 84 we are on freeway 4? Actually, the freeways are at y=1 to 8, and we are at y=4. So at turn 84 we must check freeway 4 for collision.\n\n Let me reexamine the collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". So at turn T, we are at (0, y_T), and we check the freeway y_T.\n\n Steps:\n\n We are at turn 84: y_84 = 4. We check freeway 4 at turn 84.\n\n Freeway 4 has cars: \n   (-24, -35, right, 4) -> this is right-moving. At turn 84 (T=t1=84, so T-t1=0), so span = [-35, -24]? \n   But wait: the representation is (head, tail, direction, speed). For a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost? Actually, the update rule for right-moving: \n        initial span at t1: [tau, h] -> but the car is given as (head, tail). \n\n   The table says: for right-moving: [Span(t1) = [tau, h]] -> so the head is h and tail is tau? Then at t1, the car is from tau to h? \n\n   Let me check the example: \n        (-24, -35, right, 4): \n        The update rule for right-moving: \n            Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n        So at T=84 (t1=84, so T-t1=0): \n            tau = -35, h = -24 -> span = [-35, -24]? \n        But the car is right-moving, so it moves to the right. \n\n   However, note that the representation in the table: \n        \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\" \n\n   So for a right-moving car, the head is the front (right end) and tail is the rear (left end). \n\n   Therefore, at T=84, the car is at [-35, -24]? But note: the representation in the update rule for right-moving says: \n        Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> so at t1: from tau to h, which is from -35 to -24? \n\n   But that doesn't make sense because -35 < -24, so the car would be from -35 to -24? Then it's moving right: at time T, the car will be at [ -35 + 4*(T-84), -24 + 4*(T-84) ].\n\n   Similarly, the other cars on freeway 4: \n        (12, 1, right, 4): at t1=84: [1, 12]? \n        (48, 37, right, 4): at t1=84: [37, 48]? \n\n   So freeway 4 at turn 84 has three cars: \n        car1: [-35, -24] -> which is from x=-35 to x=-24 (so doesn't cover 0)\n        car2: [1, 12] -> covers 0? No, because 1 to 12: 0 is not between 1 and 12? (0 < 1) -> so safe.\n        car3: [37,48] -> safe.\n\n   Therefore, at turn 84, freeway 4 is safe.\n\n Now we have to plan for the next turns.\n\n We can consider moving up (U), down (D), or stay (S). Since we want to minimize H, we prefer U. But we must avoid collisions on the freeways we step on.\n\n We are at y=4 at turn 84. We want to go to y=9. The minimal moves would be 5 consecutive Ups. But we have to check if that path is safe.\n\n Let's simulate:\n\n Turn 84: at y=4 -> safe (as above).\n\n Action at turn 84: we choose U -> then at turn 85, we will be at y=5.\n\n At turn 85, we are on freeway 5. We must check freeway 5 at turn 85.\n\n Freeway 5 cars at t1=84 (initial state) and then at T=85 (so T-t1=1):\n\n   Car1: (24, 13, right, 12) -> right-moving, so at T=85: \n        tau = 13, h = 24 -> becomes [13 + 12*1, 24 + 12*1] = [25, 36] -> doesn't cover 0? safe.\n\n   Car2: (-48, -59, right, 12) -> becomes [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47, -36] -> safe.\n\n   So freeway 5 at turn 85 is safe.\n\n Then action at turn 85: U -> turn 86 at y=6.\n\n Check freeway 6 at turn 86 (T-t1=2):\n\n   Same cars as freeway 5? \n        Car1: [13+12*2, 24+12*2] = [13+24, 24+24] = [37,48] -> safe.\n        Car2: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35, -24] -> safe.\n\n Then action at turn 86: U -> turn 87 at y=7.\n\n Freeway 7 at turn 87 (T-t1=3):\n        Car1: [13+36, 24+36] = [49,60] -> safe.\n        Car2: [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23, -12] -> safe.\n\n Then action at turn 87: U -> turn 88 at y=8.\n\n Freeway 8 at turn 88 (T-t1=4):\n        Car1: [13+48, 24+48] = [61,72] -> safe.\n        Car2: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0] -> wait, 0 is included? [-11, 0] -> so 0 is at the right end? \n\n        The span is [tau, h] for right-moving? Actually, the update rule: \n            right-moving: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n            So at T=88: car2: [ -59 + 12*4, -48 + 12*4 ] = [ -59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0] -> so the car covers from -11 to 0. Therefore, 0 is included -> collision.\n\n        So at turn 88, if we are at y=8, we collide with the second car on freeway 8.\n\n Therefore, the direct 5-step U plan fails at turn 88.\n\n We need to avoid that collision. How?\n\n We have a few options:\n   - Delay the move to freeway 8 by one turn? \n   - Or take a detour? (but we are going upward, and we cannot go above 9, so detour might mean going down then up? but that would take more turns)\n\n Let me try to see if we can avoid freeway 8 at turn 88? \n\n We are at turn 87: we are at y=7. Instead of going up to 8 at turn 87->88, we might:\n\n   Option 1: At turn 87: do S (stay) at y=7. Then at turn 88, we are still at y=7 -> check freeway 7 at turn 88 (T-t1=4):\n\n        Freeway 7 cars: same as above? \n            Car1: [13+12*4, 24+12*4] = [13+48,24+48]=[61,72] -> safe.\n            Car2: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> but note: we are at freeway 7, not 8. So we don't check freeway 8? So safe.\n\n        Then at turn 88: we can do U to go to y=8 at turn 89.\n\n        Now at turn 89: we are at y=8. Check freeway 8 at turn 89 (T-t1=5):\n            Car1: [13+12*5, 24+12*5] = [13+60,24+60]=[73,84] -> safe.\n            Car2: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> safe (0 not in [1,12]).\n\n        Then at turn 89: we do U to go to y=9 at turn 90 -> goal.\n\n        Total turns: from turn84 to turn90 -> 6 turns? But note: we are at turn84, and we do 6 actions: \n            turn84: U -> to y=5 at turn85\n            turn85: U -> to y=6 at turn86\n            turn86: U -> to y=7 at turn87\n            turn87: S -> stay at y=7 at turn88\n            turn88: U -> to y=8 at turn89\n            turn89: U -> to y=9 at turn90 -> then we are at y=9 at turn90, so we stop after the 6th action? \n\n        But note: we are required to reach at turn t1+H-1. We start at turn84 (t=0) and do H actions? \n\n        Actually, we start at turn84 with y=4. Then we do an action at turn84 to get to turn85 at y=5, ... until turn90 at y=9. So we have H=6 actions: from turn84 to turn89 (inclusive) and we are at turn90 (which is t1+6) and y=9. \n\n        So H=6.\n\n        Is there a way with 5? We saw that 5 consecutive U leads to collision at turn88. \n\n        What if we do a different action at turn87? Instead of staying, we could go down? but that would be counterproductive.\n\n        Alternatively, we might try to go faster? But we are going as fast as we can.\n\n        Or we might skip freeway 8 at a different time? \n\n        Let me check if we can avoid the collision by going to freeway 8 at a different turn? \n\n        We are at y=7 at turn87. We must go to y=8 at some turn. Let T be the turn we are on freeway 8. Then we need T such that at freeway 8, no car has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\n        The cars on freeway 8 (same as freeway 5,6,7) are:\n\n            Car1: (24,13,right,12) -> at turn T: [13+12*(T-84), 24+12*(T-84)]\n            Car2: (-48,-59,right,12) -> at turn T: [-59+12*(T-84), -48+12*(T-84)]\n\n        We require that 0 is not in [13+12*(T-84), 24+12*(T-84)] and not in [-59+12*(T-84), -48+12*(T-84)].\n\n        For car2: 0 in [-59+12*k, -48+12*k] for k = T-84?\n            -59+12*k <= 0 <= -48+12*k  -> \n            => 12*k <= 48 -> k<=4, and 12*k>=59? -> k>= ceil(59/12)=ceil(4.916)=5 -> contradiction? \n            Actually, let's check k=4: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> includes 0.\n            k=5: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        k=6: [-59+72, -48+72] = [13,24] -> safe.\n\n        So we must avoid k=4 (i.e., T-84=4 -> T=88) for freeway 8. We can be on freeway 8 at k=5 (T=89) or k=6 (T=90) etc.\n\n        Therefore, we can be at freeway 8 at turn89 or later.\n\n        So we can plan:\n\n            turn84: U -> y=5 at turn85\n            turn85: U -> y=6 at turn86\n            turn86: U -> y=7 at turn87\n            turn87: we must not go to y=8 at turn88 (because then we'd be at freeway8 at turn88, which is k=4). So we wait at y=7 for one turn? \n                turn87: S -> at turn88 we are still at y=7 (so we check freeway7 at turn88, which we saw is safe: car2 at freeway7 at turn88 is [-11,0] but we are on freeway7, not freeway8? Actually, at turn88, if we are at y=7, we check freeway7. The cars on freeway7 at turn88 (k=4): \n                    car1: [13+48,24+48]=[61,72] -> safe\n                    car2: [-59+48, -48+48]=[-11,0] -> but note: the collision rule says we check the freeway we are on (y=7). So we are safe? \n                However, wait: the car2 on freeway7 at turn88: the span is [-11,0]. Since we are at (0,7) and the freeway is 7, and the car is on freeway7? Then 0 is in the span -> collision? \n\n        Oh no! We forgot: at turn88, if we are at y=7, we must check freeway7. And car2 on freeway7 at turn88: [-11,0] -> which covers 0? So we would collide at turn88 if we stay at y=7? \n\n        Therefore, we cannot stay at y=7 at turn88.\n\n        Then what? We must leave freeway7 at turn87? \n\n        At turn87: we are at y=7. We have two choices: U (to 8) or D (to 6) or S (stay at 7). \n          U: leads to y=8 at turn88 -> then at turn88 we are on freeway8 at k=4 -> collision (car2 on freeway8: [-11,0] -> but wait, at freeway8 at turn88: \n                car2: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> so 0 is included -> collision.\n\n          S: we stay at y=7 at turn88 -> then we are on freeway7 at turn88 -> and car2 on freeway7 at turn88: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\n          D: we go down to y=6 at turn88.\n\n        Then at turn88: we are at y=6. Check freeway6 at turn88 (k=4):\n            Freeway6 cars: same as freeway5? \n                car1: [13+48,24+48]=[61,72] -> safe\n                car2: [-59+48,-48+48]=[-11,0] -> but we are on freeway6? Then we don't check freeway7? \n            Actually, we check freeway6 at turn88: \n                The cars on freeway6 at turn88: \n                    car1: [13+12*4,24+12*4]=[61,72] -> safe\n                    car2: [-59+12*4, -48+12*4]=[-11,0] -> but note: the car is on freeway6? Then if 0 is in the span, we collide? \n                However, the car is on freeway6? Then we must check: at turn88, freeway6 has a car covering [-11,0] -> so 0 is included -> collision.\n\n        So even going down to y=6 at turn88 leads to collision? \n\n        Then we are stuck? \n\n        Let me double-check the freeway6 at turn88: \n            The car2 on freeway6: at turn88 (k=4): from -59+48 = -11 to -48+48=0 -> so the span is [-11,0] -> and we are at x=0 -> so yes, collision.\n\n        How about freeway5? \n            At turn88 (k=4): \n                car1: [13+48,24+48]=[61,72] -> safe\n                car2: [-59+48,-48+48]=[-11,0] -> collision.\n\n        And freeway4? \n            At turn88 (k=4): \n                The cars on freeway4: \n                  (-24,-35,right,4): at k=4: [-35+4*4, -24+4*4] = [-35+16, -24+16] = [-19,-8] -> does not cover 0? safe.\n                  (12,1,right,4): [1+16,12+16]=[17,28] -> safe.\n                  (48,37,right,4): [37+16,48+16]=[53,64] -> safe.\n\n        So freeway4 is safe at turn88.\n\n        How about freeway3? \n            The table: freeway3: (-30,-41,right,3) -> at turn88 (k=4): \n                right-moving: [tau, h] = [-41, -30] -> then at k=4: [-41+3*4, -30+3*4] = [-41+12, -30+12] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\n\n        Similarly, freeway2 and 1 are safe? \n\n        So we have a safe freeway at turn88: freeway4 (and also 1,2,3) but we are at y=6? We can only move to adjacent freeways.\n\n        So we must avoid being on freeway5,6,7,8 at turn88? \n\n        How can we get off freeway7 at turn87 without going to 6,7,8? We can only go to 6 or 8? \n\n        Alternatively, we can leave freeway7 earlier? \n\n        Let me reexamine the entire path.\n\n        We are at y=4 at turn84 (safe). We go up to y=5 at turn85 (safe). Then to y=6 at turn86 (safe). Then to y=7 at turn87 (safe). \n\n        But then at turn87 we are at y=7 and we must avoid being at freeway5,6,7,8 at turn88? \n\n        We have to be at some freeway at turn88. The safe freeways at turn88 are y=1,2,3,4? \n\n        So we must get to one of these at turn88. How? \n\n        From y=7 at turn87, we can go down: \n            turn87: D -> then at turn88 we are at y=6? -> but we just saw freeway6 at turn88 is not safe? \n            turn87: D again? but we can only move by 1 per turn -> so we go to y=6 at turn88 -> unsafe.\n\n        Alternatively, we go down multiple turns? \n\n        But note: we are at turn87 at y=7. We can do:\n\n            turn87: D -> to y=6 at turn88 (unsafe as above) -> no.\n\n        What if we do:\n\n            turn86: instead of going to y=7, we do something else? \n\n        At turn86: we are at y=6 (safe at turn86: k=2 -> freeway6: \n            car1: [13+24,24+24]=[37,48] -> safe\n            car2: [-59+24,-48+24]=[-35,-24] -> safe)\n\n        Then at turn86, we have options:\n\n          Option A: U -> to y=7 at turn87 -> then we are at freeway7 at turn87 (k=3): \n                freeway7: \n                  car1: [13+36,24+36]=[49,60] -> safe\n                  car2: [-59+36,-48+36]=[-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n          Then at turn87, we must avoid freeway5,6,7,8 at turn88? \n\n          We are at y=7 at turn87. We can go down to y=6 at turn88? -> unsafe (freeway6 at turn88: k=4 -> car2: [-11,0] -> collision).\n\n          Or go down two steps? \n\n          How about at turn86 we don't go up? We go down? \n\n          Option B: at turn86: D -> to y=5 at turn87.\n\n          Then at turn87: we are at freeway5 at k=3: \n                freeway5: \n                  car1: [13+36,24+36]=[49,60] -> safe\n                  car2: [-59+36,-48+36]=[-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n          Then at turn87: we have to avoid freeway5,6,7,8 at turn88? \n                We are at y=5 at turn87. We can go:\n                  U: to y=6 at turn88 -> unsafe (freeway6 at turn88: collision).\n                  D: to y=4 at turn88 -> safe? because freeway4 at turn88: we checked above: safe.\n                  S: stay at y=5 at turn88 -> then check freeway5 at turn88 (k=4): \n                        car1: [61,72] -> safe\n                        car2: [-11,0] -> collision? \n\n          So we must go down to y=4 at turn87? \n\n          Then:\n            turn86: D -> to y=5 at turn87\n            turn87: D -> to y=4 at turn88 -> safe (freeway4 at turn88: safe as above)\n\n          Then we are at y=4 at turn88. Now we have to go up to 9. That will take 5 more moves? \n\n          But we can then go up from turn88 onward.\n\n          However, we lost progress.\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid the dangerous freeways at turn88 by being on a safe freeway at turn88. The safe ones are y=1,2,3,4. \n\n        So we can go down to y=4 at turn88. How?\n\n          We are at turn86 at y=6. We can do:\n            turn86: D -> to y=5 at turn87\n            turn87: D -> to y=4 at turn88 -> safe.\n\n          Then from y=4 at turn88, we go up:\n\n            turn88: U -> to y=5 at turn89\n            turn89: U -> to y=6 at turn90\n            turn90: U -> to y=7 at turn91\n            turn91: U -> to y=8 at turn92\n            turn92: U -> to y=9 at turn93 -> done in 9 actions? (from turn84 to turn92: 9 actions? H=9)\n\n        But that is 9 turns. We had a 6-turn plan that failed only at the last step. Can we do better?\n\n        We note that the dangerous turn for freeway5,6,7,8 is only at k=4 (turn88) for the car2? \n\n        Actually, freeway5,6,7,8 all have the same car pattern? \n\n        And car2 on any of these freeways at k=4: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\n        So we must not be on freeway5,6,7,8 at turn88.\n\n        But we can be on freeway5,6,7,8 at other turns? \n\n        So we can go up to y=7 by turn87, then at turn87 we go down to y=6? -> but then at turn88 we are at y=6 -> unsafe.\n\n        Or we can go up to y=7 at turn87, and then at turn87 we go down twice? But we can only do one action per turn.\n\n        How about we leave freeway7 earlier? \n\n        We are at turn85: y=5 (safe). Then at turn85 we could do something else? \n\n        Instead of going up at turn85, we go down? But that would be moving away from the goal.\n\n        Or we wait at y=5 for one turn? \n\n          turn85: S -> at turn86 we are still at y=5. Check freeway5 at turn86 (k=2): \n                car1: [13+24,24+24]=[37,48] -> safe\n                car2: [-59+24,-48+24]=[-35,-24] -> safe.\n\n          Then at turn86: U -> to y=6 at turn87 (k=3): freeway6 at turn87: \n                car1: [13+36,24+36]=[49,60] -> safe\n                car2: [-59+36,-48+36]=[-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n          Then turn87: U -> to y=7 at turn88 (k=4): freeway7 at turn88: \n                car1: [61,72] -> safe\n                car2: [-11,0] -> collision? \n\n        So same problem.\n\n        Alternatively, we go up faster? But we are already going up as fast as possible.\n\n        Another idea: can we be on freeway8 at turn89 (k=5) safely? \n            freeway8 at turn89: \n                car1: [13+60,24+60]=[73,84] -> safe\n                car2: [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        So if we can delay our arrival at freeway8 until turn89, we are safe.\n\n        How to do that without being on freeway5,6,7 at turn88? \n\n        We need to be on a freeway <5 at turn88. \n\n        So the plan:\n\n          We want to be at y=8 at turn89 (so we are on freeway8 at turn89, which is safe). \n\n          How to get to y=8 by turn89? \n\n          We start at turn84: y=4.\n\n          We need 4 moves up to get to y=8: \n            4 ->5, 5->6, 6->7, 7->8 -> 4 moves.\n\n          But we have 5 turns: from turn84 to turn89 (inclusive) is 5 actions? \n            turn84: action -> turn85\n            turn85: action -> turn86\n            turn86: action -> turn87\n            turn87: action -> turn88\n            turn88: action -> turn89\n\n          So we have 5 actions to go from y=4 to y=8 -> that requires 4 Ups and one extra action? \n\n          But we also must avoid freeway5,6,7 at turn88? \n\n          At turn88, we will be at y=8? -> then we are on freeway8 at turn88 -> which is unsafe.\n\n          We want to be at y=8 at turn89, so we should arrive at y=8 at turn89. That means the last U to y=8 is at turn88? \n\n          So we need to be at y=7 at turn88, then U at turn88 to y=8 at turn89.\n\n          But then at turn88 we are at y=7 -> and we must check freeway7 at turn88: which is unsafe (car2: [-11,0]).\n\n        So we cannot be at y=7 at turn88 either.\n\n        How about we are at y=4 at turn88, then we do 4 Ups in the next 4 turns? \n            turn88: U -> y=5 at turn89\n            turn89: U -> y=6 at turn90\n            turn90: U -> y=7 at turn91\n            turn91: U -> y=8 at turn92\n            turn92: U -> y=9 at turn93 -> 9 actions.\n\n        But we want minimal turns.\n\n        We need to be at a safe freeway at turn88 (y=1,2,3,4). Then after turn88, we can move up.\n\n        Let me see if we can be at y=4 at turn88, then we do:\n\n          turn88: U -> y=5 at turn89: check freeway5 at turn89 (k=5): \n                car1: [13+60,24+60]=[73,84] -> safe\n                car2: [-59+60,-48+60]=[1,12] -> safe.\n\n          turn89: U -> y=6 at turn90: freeway6 at turn90 (k=6): \n                car1: [13+72,24+72]=[85,96] -> safe\n                car2: [-59+72,-48+72]=[13,24] -> safe.\n\n          turn90: U -> y=7 at turn91: freeway7 at turn91 (k=7): \n                car1: [13+84,24+84]=[97,108] -> safe\n                car2: [-59+84,-48+84]=[25,36] -> safe.\n\n          turn91: U -> y=8 at turn92: freeway8 at turn92 (k=8): \n                car1: [13+96,24+96]=[109,120] -> safe\n                car2: [-59+96,-48+96]=[37,48] -> safe.\n\n          turn92: U -> y=9 at turn93.\n\n          Total actions: from turn84 to turn92 -> 9 actions.\n\n        But is there a faster way? \n\n        We only need to avoid freeway5,6,7,8 at turn88. We can be on freeway4 at turn88. \n\n        How to get to freeway4 at turn88? \n\n          We start at y=4 at turn84.\n\n          We can move up and then come back down by turn88? \n\n          Example:\n\n            turn84: U -> y=5 at turn85\n            turn85: U -> y=6 at turn86\n            turn86: D -> y=5 at turn87\n            turn87: D -> y=4 at turn88\n\n          Then we are at y=4 at turn88 (safe).\n\n          Then from turn88 onward: as above, 5 moves to get to 9: \n                turn88: U -> y=5 at turn89\n                turn89: U -> y=6 at turn90\n                turn90: U -> y=7 at turn91\n                turn91: U -> y=8 at turn92\n                turn92: U -> y=9 at turn93\n\n          Total actions: 8 actions? \n                turns: 84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92 -> 9 actions? \n\n          Count: \n            84: U -> 1\n            85: U -> 2\n            86: D -> 3\n            87: D -> 4\n            88: U -> 5\n            89: U -> 6\n            90: U -> 7\n            91: U -> 8\n            92: U -> 9\n\n          H=9.\n\n        But wait, we are at y=9 at turn93, which is turn84+9. \n\n        Alternatively, after turn88 we are at y=4. We need to get to y=9, which is 5 steps up. So minimal from there is 5 moves. So total 4 (for the first four) + 5 = 9.\n\n        Can we do better than 9? \n\n        We must be at a safe freeway at turn88. The safe freeways are y=1,2,3,4. The closest to the goal is y=4. \n\n        How to get to y=4 at turn88 in fewer than 4 actions? We start at y=4 at turn84. We can stay for 4 turns? \n\n          turn84: S\n          turn85: S\n          turn86: S\n          turn87: S\n          turn88: S -> then we are at y=4 at turn88. Safe.\n\n          Then we need 5 Ups to get to 9: \n                turn88: U -> y=5 at turn89\n                turn89: U -> y=6 at turn90\n                turn90: U -> y=7 at turn91\n                turn91: U -> y=8 at turn92\n                turn92: U -> y=9 at turn93\n\n          Total: 8 actions? \n                turns: 84:S, 85:S, 86:S, 87:S, 88:U, 89:U, 90:U, 91:U, 92:U -> 9 actions.\n\n        Still 9.\n\n        But note: we can move up during the first 4 turns as long as we come back to y=4 by turn88. \n\n        For example, we can do:\n\n          turn84: U -> y=5\n          turn85: D -> y=4\n          turn86: S\n          turn87: S\n          turn88: we are at y=4\n\n        Then we do the 5 Ups. Total actions: 4 (for the first 4) + 5 = 9.\n\n        Or we can do:\n\n          turn84: U -> y=5\n          turn85: U -> y=6\n          turn86: D -> y=5\n          turn87: D -> y=4\n          turn88: at y=4\n\n        Then 5 Ups: total 9.\n\n        How about we use the fact that freeway4 is safe at every turn? \n\n        But we are required to reach y=9.\n\n        Is there a way to be at y=8 at turn89? That would require:\n\n          turn88: we must be at y=7 or y=8? \n          If at turn88 we are at y=7, then at turn88 we are on freeway7 -> unsafe.\n          If at turn88 we are at y=8, then we are on freeway8 -> unsafe.\n\n        So we cannot be at y=7 or 8 at turn88. \n\n        The earliest we can be at y=8 is turn89, and we must come from y=7 at turn88? But turn88 we cannot be at y=7. \n\n        So we must be at y<=6 at turn88, and then we need at least 3 moves to get to y=9 (6->7,7->8,8->9) -> but wait, from y=6 to y=9: 3 Ups? \n\n        Actually: \n          from y=6: \n            6->7: one U\n            7->8: second U\n            8->9: third U\n\n        So 3 moves.\n\n        Then if we can be at y=6 at turn88, then we can do:\n\n          turn88: U -> y=7 at turn89\n          turn89: U -> y=8 at turn90\n          turn90: U -> y=9 at turn91\n\n        But can we be at y=6 at turn88? \n          We start at y=4 at turn84.\n\n          We need to get to y=6 at turn88: that's 4 turns to gain 2 in y.\n\n          We can do: \n            turn84: U -> y=5\n            turn85: U -> y=6\n            turn86: ... we are at y=6 at turn86. Then we have to stay or move until turn88.\n\n          But at turn86 and turn87, we are at y=6. We have to avoid freeway6 at turn86 and turn87? \n                turn86: freeway6 at k=2: safe (as before)\n                turn87: freeway6 at k=3: \n                      car1: [49,60] -> safe\n                      car2: [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n          Then at turn87: we can stay at y=6 (S) -> then at turn88: we are at y=6. \n\n          But freeway6 at turn88 (k=4): car2: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\n        So we cannot be at y=6 at turn88.\n\n        Similarly, y=5 at turn88: freeway5 at turn88 (k=4): car2: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\n        Therefore, the only safe freeways at turn88 are y=1,2,3,4.\n\n        And the highest is y=4.\n\n        So the best is to be at y=4 at turn88, then we do 5 Ups: \n            turn88: U -> y=5 at turn89 (safe: freeway5 at k=5: car2=[1,12] -> safe)\n            turn89: U -> y=6 at turn90 (freeway6 at k=6: car2=[13,24] -> safe)\n            turn90: U -> y=7 at turn91 (freeway7 at k=7: car2=[25,36] -> safe)\n            turn91: U -> y=8 at turn92 (freeway8 at k=8: car2=[37,48] -> safe)\n            turn92: U -> y=9 at turn93.\n\n        Total actions: from turn84 to turn92 -> 9 actions.\n\n        But is there a way to be at y=4 at turn88 with fewer than 4 actions? We start at y=4. We can do nothing for 4 turns: \n            turn84: S\n            turn85: S\n            turn86: S\n            turn87: S\n            turn88: S -> 4 actions and we are at y=4.\n\n        Then 5 actions for the Ups: total 9.\n\n        Or we can move around and come back, but it won't reduce the number of actions.\n\n        However, wait: we might be able to be at y=4 at turn88 in 4 actions, but during these actions we might have moved up and then down, which might allow us to reduce the number of actions later? \n\n        But the later part is fixed: 5 actions to go from y=4 to y=9.\n\n        So total 9.\n\n        But let me see if we can reach y=9 in fewer than 9 actions? \n\n        The minimal without cars is 5. With cars, we have to avoid one turn (turn88) on freeways 5-8. \n\n        We have to \"waste\" 4 actions to wait for turn88 to pass? \n\n        Actually, from turn84 to turn88, we have 4 turns. We can use these 4 turns to move in a way that we are at y=4 at turn88. And then 5 turns to go up. Total 9.\n\n        Is there a way to integrate the waiting with the upward movement? \n\n        For example, can we be at y=5 at turn88? -> no, because freeway5 at turn88 is unsafe.\n\n        Similarly, y=6,7,8 at turn88 are unsafe.\n\n        So we must be at y<=4 at turn88.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal number of turns is 9.\n\n        But let me double-check if there is a path that avoids turn88 on the dangerous freeways without taking 9 actions.\n\n        Alternative idea: go down initially to a lower freeway and then come up after turn88? \n\n        For example:\n\n          turn84: D -> to y=3 at turn85\n          turn85: D -> to y=2 at turn86\n          turn86: D -> to y=1 at turn87\n          turn87: D -> but y cannot be below 0! So we cannot go below y=0. \n\n          Or we stay at y=1 at turn87.\n\n          Then at turn88: we can be at y=1 (safe, because freeway1 at turn88: \n                freeway1: (-30,-41,right,3) at turn88 (k=4): \n                    right-moving: [-41+3*4, -30+3*4] = [-41+12, -30+12] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\n\n          Then after turn88, we have to go from y=1 to y=9: 8 steps up. \n\n          So total actions: \n                turn84: D (1)\n                turn85: D (2)\n                turn86: D (3)\n                turn87: S (or U? but we are at y=1, if we U then y=2 at turn88 -> freeway2 at turn88: same as freeway1? \n                        freeway2: same car pattern: [-29,-18] -> safe. So we can go up at turn87)\n                Let's go up at turn87: \n                    turn87: U -> y=2 at turn88 (freeway2: safe)\n                turn88: U -> y=3 at turn89 (freeway3: at k=5: [-41+15, -30+15] = [-26,-15] -> safe)\n                turn89: U -> y=4 at turn90 (freeway4: we need to check at turn90: k=6: \n                      car1: [-35+4*6, -24+4*6] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> collision? \n                      But wait, freeway4 cars: \n                          (-24,-35,right,4): at k=6: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> collision at turn90 on freeway4.\n\n          So we collide at turn90.\n\n          We can avoid freeway4 at turn90? \n                We are at y=3 at turn89. Then at turn89: we can go to y=4 at turn90? -> then we are on freeway4 at turn90 -> collision.\n\n          Or we can go to y=5 at turn90? \n                turn89: U from y=3 to y=4 at turn90 -> then we are at freeway4 at turn90 -> collision.\n\n          Or we can skip freeway4 by going from y=3 to y=5 in one turn? -> no, only one step.\n\n          So we have to go through freeway4 at some turn. When is freeway4 safe? \n\n          Freeway4 has three cars:\n            1.

(48,37,right,4): [37+4*k,48+4*k] -> always positive -> safe.\n\n          So freeway4 is only safe for k<6 or k>=9? \n\n          k<6: \n            k=0: [-35,-24] -> safe.\n            k=1: [-31,-20] -> safe.\n            k=2: [-27,-16] -> safe.\n            k=3: [-23,-12] -> safe.\n            k=4: [-19,-8] -> safe.\n            k=5: [-15,-4] -> safe.\n            k=6: [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n            k=7: [-7,4] -> unsafe.\n            k=8: [-3,8] -> unsafe.\n            k=9: [1,12] -> safe.\n\n          Therefore, to use freeway4, we must be at turn84+k for k in {0,1,2,3,4,5} or k>=9.\n\n          In our plan to be at y=4 at turn88 (k=4) is safe, and then we do:\n\n            turn88: U -> to y=5 at turn89 (k=5 for freeway4? no, because at turn89 we are on freeway5, not freeway4)\n\n          But when we are at y=4 at turn88 (k=4), and then we leave at turn88 to y=5, we are not on freeway4 after turn88.\n\n          The next time we might be on freeway4 is if we come back down? \n\n          In the upward path from turn88 onward:\n\n            turn88: at y=4 (k=4) -> safe.\n            turn88: U -> to y=5 at turn89: then at turn89 we are on freeway5, not freeway4.\n\n          So we are safe from freeway4 as long as we are not on freeway4 at the dangerous turns.\n\n          However, note that when we are moving upward, we won't be on freeway4 again.\n\n          But what if we are at y=4 at turn88 (k=4) and then we go up, we are done with freeway4.\n\n          The only potential issue is the next freeways.\n\n        Therefore, our first plan of staying at y=4 for 4 actions (S for turns 84,85,86,87) and then doing 5 Ups (turns88,89,90,91,92) is safe and takes 9 actions.\n\n        But we can also move during the first 4 turns as long as we are at y=4 at turn88. \n\n        To minimize the number of actions, 9 is the best we can do? \n\n        Let me try to see if we can be at y=4 at turn88 and also have made some progress upward during the first 4 turns.\n\n        For example, can we do:\n\n          turn84: U -> y=5 at turn85\n          turn85: D -> y=4 at turn86\n          turn86: S \n          turn87: S \n          turn88: we are at y=4\n\n          Then we do the 5 Ups: same as before.\n\n          Total actions: 9.\n\n        Or: \n\n          turn84: U -> y=5\n          turn85: U -> y=6\n          turn86: D -> y=5\n          turn87: D -> y=4\n          turn88: y=4\n\n          Then 5 Ups.\n\n          Total: 9 actions.\n\n        So no savings.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 9.\n\n        Now, we need to output a sequence of 9 actions.\n\n        We can choose any sequence that has us at y=4 at turn88 and then 5 Ups.\n\n        One simple sequence:\n\n          turn84: S\n          turn85: S\n          turn86: S\n          turn87: S\n          turn88: U\n          turn89: U\n          turn90: U\n          turn91: U\n          turn92: U\n\n        But let me verify the collisions:\n\n          turn84: y=4 -> freeway4 at turn84: safe (as initially checked).\n          turn85: S -> y=4 -> freeway4 at turn85: k=1: \n                  car1: [-35+4, -24+4] = [-31,-20] -> safe.\n                  car2: [1+4,12+4]=[5,16] -> safe.\n                  car3: [37+4,48+4]=[41,52] -> safe.\n          turn86: S -> y=4: freeway4 at turn86: k=2: \n                  car1: [-35+8,-24+8]=[-27,-16] -> safe.\n                  car2: [1+8,12+8]=[9,20] -> safe.\n                  car3: [37+8,48+8]=[45,56] -> safe.\n          turn87: S -> y=4: freeway4 at turn87: k=3: \n                  car1: [-35+12,-24+12]=[-23,-12] -> safe.\n                  car2: [1+12,12+12]=[13,24] -> safe.\n                  car3: [37+12,48+12]=[49,60] -> safe.\n          turn88: U -> to y=5 at turn89: freeway5 at turn89: k=5: \n                  car1: [13+60,24+60]=[73,84] -> safe.\n                  car2: [-59+60,-48+60]=[1,12] -> safe.\n          turn89: U -> to y=6 at turn90: freeway6 at turn90: k=6: \n                  car1: [13+72,24+72]=[85,96] -> safe.\n                  car2: [-59+72,-48+72]=[13,24] -> safe.\n          turn90: U -> to y=7 at turn91: freeway7 at turn91: k=7: \n                  car1: [13+84,24+84]=[97,108] -> safe.\n                  car2: [-59+84,-48+84]=[25,36] -> safe.\n          turn91: U -> to y=8 at turn92: freeway8 at turn92: k=8: \n                  car1: [13+96,24+96]=[109,120] -> safe.\n                  car2: [-59+96,-48+96]=[37,48] -> safe.\n          turn92: U -> to y=9 at turn93: goal.\n\n        This is safe.\n\n        But is there a sequence with fewer than 9 actions? We think not.\n\n        However, let me see if we can reach y=9 by turn92 in fewer than 9 actions? \n\n        We have to be at y=4 at turn88, which is turn84+4. Then from turn88 to turn92 is 4 turns? \n\n        Actually, from turn88 to turn92 is 4 actions (88,89,90,91) and then at turn92 we do the last action to get to y=9 at turn93? \n\n        How can we cover 5 levels (4 to 9) in 4 actions? We can't, because each action changes by at most 1.\n\n        Therefore, 9 is minimal.\n\n        We can also do a sequence that moves during the first 4 turns but returns to y=4 at turn88, for example:\n\n          turn84: U -> y=5\n          turn85: D -> y=4\n          turn86: U -> y=5\n          turn87: D -> y=4\n          turn88: y=4\n          then the same 5 Ups.\n\n        This is also 9 actions and safe.\n\n        But the simplest is to stay for 4 turns.\n\n        However, note that we might be able to use the upward moves during the first 4 turns if we can avoid freeway4 during its dangerous turns? \n\n        But we are on freeway4 during the first 4 turns (k=0,1,2,3,4) and we've checked they are safe.\n\n        So any sequence that has net zero move in the first 4 turns and leaves us at y=4 at turn88 is acceptable.\n\n        I choose the simple one: four S's then five U's.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns\", and we have 9 turns.\n\n        However, let me see if there is a 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 action sequence.\n\n        We must be at y=9 at turn84+H-1.\n\n        We start at turn84. We want to know if there is a sequence of H actions that gets us to y=9 at turn84+H-1.\n\n        For H=5: \n            turns: 84,85,86,87,88 -> then we are at turn88 (which is 84+4) after 5 actions? \n            Actually, after 5 actions we are at turn89? \n                action0 at turn84 -> turn85\n                action1 at turn85 -> turn86\n                action2 at turn86 -> turn87\n                action3 at turn87 -> turn88\n                action4 at turn88 -> turn89\n            So at turn89 we are at y=9.\n\n            How to get from y=4 to y=9 in 5 actions? \n                We need 5 Ups: U,U,U,U,U.\n                Then positions:\n                  turn84: start y=4\n                  turn84: U -> y=5 at turn85\n                  turn85: U -> y=6 at turn86\n                  turn86: U -> y=7 at turn87\n                  turn87: U -> y=8 at turn88\n                  turn88: U -> y=9 at turn89\n\n            But then at turn88 we are at y=8 -> freeway8 at turn88: car2: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\n            So H=5 fails.\n\n        H=6:\n            We would be at turn89 after 6 actions.\n            We need to get from y=4 to y=9 in 6 actions. The minimal moves upward is 5, so we can have one extra action that is not U. \n            Possibilities: one S or one D.\n\n            Example with an S:\n                actions: U,U,U,U,S,U -> \n                  84: U -> y=5 at 85\n                  85: U -> y=6 at 86\n                  86: U -> y=7 at 87\n                  87: U -> y=8 at 88 -> collision on freeway8 at turn88.\n\n            Example with a D somewhere? \n                But then we might not have time to recover.\n\n            Example: \n                U,U,U,S,U,U\n                  84: U->5\n                  85: U->6\n                  86: U->7\n                  87: S->7 (at 88) -> then at turn88 we are at y=7: freeway7 at turn88: car2: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\n            U,U,S,U,U,U\n                  84: U->5\n                  85: U->6\n                  86: S->6 (at87): freeway6 at turn87: safe (k=3: car2=[-23,-12])\n                  87: U->7 (at88): freeway7 at turn88: collision.\n\n            U,S,U,U,U,U\n                  84: U->5\n                  85: S->5 (at86): freeway5 at turn86: k=2: car2=[-35,-24] -> safe.\n                  86: U->6 (at87): freeway6 at turn87: safe.\n                  87: U->7 (at88): freeway7 at turn88: collision.\n\n            S,U,U,U,U,U\n                  84: S->4 (at85): freeway4 at turn85: safe (k=1)\n                  85: U->5 (at86): freeway5 at turn86: safe (k=2: car2=[-35,-24])\n                  86: U->6 (at87): freeway6 at turn87: safe.\n                  87: U->7 (at88): freeway7 at turn88: collision.\n\n            So every 6-action sequence has us at either y=7 or y=8 at turn88, which is unsafe.\n\n        H=7: \n            We are at turn84+6 = turn90 after 7 actions.\n            We need to be at y=9 at turn90.\n            So the last action (action6 at turn89) must bring us to y=9. So at turn89 we must be at y=8.\n            Then action6: U to y=9 at turn90.\n\n            How to be at y=8 at turn89? \n                We must avoid freeway8 at turn89? \n                    freeway8 at turn89 (k=5): safe.\n\n            But how to be at y=8 at turn89 without being on freeway7 or freeway8 at turn88? \n                Because at turn88, we would be at y=7 or y=8? \n                If at turn88 we are at y=7, then freeway7 at turn88: unsafe.\n                If at turn88 we are at y=8, then freeway8 at turn88: unsafe.\n\n            So we must avoid freeway7 and freeway8 at turn88.\n\n            Therefore, at turn88 we must be at y<=6.\n\n            Then from turn88 (y<=6) to turn89 (y=8) is not possible in one action: we can only move by 1.\n\n            So we must be at y=7 at turn89. Then action6 at turn89: U to y=8 at turn90? \n                But we need to be at y=9 at turn90. \n\n            This is not matching.\n\n            Let me clarify the turns:\n\n                We start at turn84: y=4.\n                We do 7 actions: \n                  action0 at turn84 -> turn85: state y1\n                  action1 at turn85 -> turn86: y2\n                  action2 at turn86 -> turn87: y3\n                  action3 at turn87 -> turn88: y4\n                  action4 at turn88 -> turn89: y5\n                  action5 at turn89 -> turn90: y6\n                  action6 at turn90 -> turn91: y7   -> but we need to be at y=9 at turn90? \n\n            Actually, the player is at (0, y_{t}) at turn t.\n            After an action at turn t, the next state is at turn t+1.\n\n            We want at some turn T = t1 + H - 1 to be at y=9.\n\n            Here, t1=84, so T = 84 + H - 1.\n\n            For H=7, T = 84+6 = 90.\n\n            So at turn90, we must be at y=9.\n\n            How to be at y=9 at turn90? \n\n            We have 7 actions from turn84 to turn90? \n                turn84: action0 -> turn85\n                turn85: action1 -> turn86\n                turn86: action2 -> turn87\n                turn87: action3 -> turn88\n                turn88: action4 -> turn89\n                turn89: action5 -> turn90\n                turn90: action6 -> turn91   -> but we are at turn91 after the last action.\n\n            We are at turn91 after 7 actions, not turn90.\n\n            Actually, after the first action at turn84, we are at turn85. After the second at turn85, we are at turn86, ... after the 7th action at turn90, we are at turn91.\n\n            But the problem says: we start at turn84, and we do actions at turns 84, 85, 86, ... until we have done H actions, and then at turn84+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\n            So after H actions, we have advanced H turns: \n                We are at turn84 after 0 actions.\n                After 1 action, at turn85.\n                ...\n                After H actions, at turn84+H.\n\n            But the problem says: at turn t1+H-1 = 84+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\n            So we require:\n                84 + H - 1 = 84 + H - 1 = the turn after the last action? \n\n            Actually, the last action is taken at turn84+H-1, and then the state at turn84+H is determined, but the problem says at turn84+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\n            This is confusing.\n\n            Let me reread the player update:\n\n                y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where the action a_t is applied at turn t.\n\n            So if we are at turn t, we do a_t, and then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\n            We start at turn84: y84 = 4.\n\n            We do an action at turn84: then at turn85 we are at y85 = y84 + Δy84.\n\n            We do an action at turn85: then at turn86 we are at y86 = y85 + Δy85.\n\n            ...\n\n            We do an action at turn84+H-1: then at turn84+H we are at y_{84+H} = y_{84+H-1} + Δy_{84+H-1}.\n\n            The problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn84+H-1\". \n\n            But according to the update, at the turn when we do the last action (turn84+H-1), the player is at y_{84+H-1} (before the action). After the action, at turn84+H, we are at the next state.\n\n            However, the problem says: \"at turn84+H-1\" we must be at (0,9).\n\n            So we require that after the action at turn84+H-1, we are at y=9 at turn84+H-1? \n\n            But the update rule says that after the action at turn84+H-1, we are at y_{84+H} = y_{84+H-1} + Δy_{84+H-1}, and that is at turn84+H.\n\n            This seems inconsistent.\n\n            Let me read carefully: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) at turn84+H-1\"\n\n            And the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + ... \n\n            So at turn t, we are at y_t. Then we do an action a_t, and then we are at y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\n            We start at turn84: we are at y84=4.\n\n            We want to be at (0,9) at turn84+H-1.\n\n            That means we want y_{84+H-1} = 9.\n\n            How many actions have we taken by turn84+H-1? \n                We take actions at turns: 84, 85, 86, ..., 84+H-2? \n                Because the last action that affects y_{84+H-1} is at turn84+H-2.\n\n            Example: \n                H=1: we want to be at turn84+1-1 = turn84. We don't take any action? But we are at y=4, not 9.\n\n            H=2: we want to be at turn84+1 = 85. \n                We take an action at turn84: then at turn85 we are at y85 = 4 + Δ. \n                We require y85=9. \n                But Δ can only be -1,0,1 -> we can only be at 3,4,5 at turn85.\n\n            So we need more.\n\n            In general, we take actions at turns 84,85,...,84+H-2, and then at turn84+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\n            The number of actions is H-1.\n\n            But the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1\"\n\n            That would be actions at turns t1 (84), 84+1, 84+2, ... 84+H-1.\n\n            And then at turn84+H we are at y_{84+H} = y_{84+H-1} + ... \n\n            But the problem says we should be at (0,9) at turn84+H-1.\n\n            This is a discrepancy.\n\n            Let me read the problem again: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t=0,1,...,H-1 -> so actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\n            And then the next turn after the last action is t1+H.\n\n            But the problem says: \"at turn84+H-1\".\n\n            So they want us to be at (0,9) at the turn immediately after the last action? That doesn't match.\n\n            Or is it at the turn of the last action? \n\n            The problem says: \"at turn84+H-1\", and the last action is at turn84+H-1. \n\n            At the moment of turn84+H-1, we are at y_{84+H-1} (which is the state before the action). Then we do the action a_{84+H-1} and move to y_{84+H}.\n\n            So to be at (0,9) at turn84+H-1, we require y_{84+H-1}=9.\n\n            But then the action a_{84+H-1} is taken at turn84+H-1, and it will change the state to y_{84+H} which might not be 9.\n\n            And the problem doesn't require that.\n\n            So it must be that we are at y=9 at turn84+H-1, and we don't necessarily do an action after that? \n\n            The sequence has H actions, from turn84 to turn84+H-1.\n\n            After the last action (at turn84+H-1), we are at turn84+H, but the problem says we must be at (0,9) at turn84+H-1.\n\n            This is before the last action? \n\n            Or after the last action at turn84+H-1, the state at turn84+H-1 is updated to the new state? \n\n            The update rule: after doing an action at turn t, the next state at turn t+1 is updated.\n\n            Therefore, at turn84, we are at y84=4.\n            After action at turn84, we are at y85 = ... \n            ...\n\n            After action at turn84+H-1, we are at y_{84+H} = ...\n\n            The state at turn84+H-1 is the state BEFORE the action at turn84+H-1.\n\n            To be at (0,9) at turn84+H-1, we must have y_{84+H-1}=9.\n\n            And then we do the action at turn84+H-1, but that doesn't affect the state at turn84+H-1.\n\n            So the last action (at turn84+H-1) is not necessary for being at 9, but we have to do it? \n\n            The problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then at turn84+H-1 we are at (0,9).\n\n            This is achievable if we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn84+H-1, and then we do an action (which might move us away, but the problem doesn't care about after).\n\n            But the collision: we have to ensure that at every turn from 84 to 84+H-1, we are not in collision.\n\n            In particular, at turn84+H-1, we are at y_{84+H-1}=9, and we must check freeway9? but freeways are only 1-8, and 9 is safe.\n\n            However, the actions are taken at each turn, including turn84+H-1, but at that turn we are at y=9, so we are not on any freeway (since freeways are 1-8) -> so no collision check for freeway at y=9.\n\n            Therefore, we can do an action at turn84+H-1 even though we are already at 9? \n\n            But the problem requires to be at (0,9) at turn84+H-1, and then we do an action that might move us to y=10? but y=10 is not allowed, so if we do U at y=9, we stay at 9.\n\n            However, the minimal H might be shorter if we do not require the last action.\n\n            Let me reexamine the problem: \n                \"minimal number of turns H\"\n\n                and the answer format: we list the actions for turns 84, 84+1, ... until turn84+H-1.\n\n            So H is the number of actions.\n\n            And we are at (0,9) at turn84+H-1.\n\n            This means that the last action is taken at the same turn when we are at (0,9), and we are at (0,9) BEFORE the action? \n            But then after the action, we might leave.\n\n            However, the problem doesn't say we have to stay, only that at turn84+H-1 we are at (0,9).\n\n            So we can be at (0,9) at turn84+H-1 and then do any action.\n\n            But then we could potentially reach (0,9) in 5 actions:\n\n               actions: U,U,U,U,U at turns84,85,86,87,88.\n\n               Then at turn88 (84+5-1=88) we are at y88 = ? \n                    turn84: action0: U -> y85 = 5\n                    turn85: action1: U -> y86 = 6\n                    turn86: action2: U -> y87 = 7\n                    turn87: action3: U -> y88 = 8\n                    turn88: action4: U -> y89 = 9  -> but we are at turn89, not turn88.\n\n               We require at turn88 (84+H-1=84+5-1=88) to be at y=9. \n                    At the beginning of turn88, we are at y88=? \n                    after action at turn87, we are at y88=8.\n               So at turn88, we are at y88=8, not 9.\n\n            How to be at y=9 at turn88 (84+5-1=88)? \n                We must have done actions that get us to y=9 by the beginning of turn88.\n                That means by turn87, we are at y87=9? \n                Then at turn87 we do an action, but we are already at 9, and the action might be S, then we stay at 9 at turn88.\n\n                So the last action is at turn87 (which is the 4th action) and then at turn88 (84+4 actions? but then H=5, and 84+5-1=88) we are at y88=9.\n\n            Therefore, we only need 4 actions to be at turn87 at y=9? \n                actions at turns84,85,86,87.\n\n                then at turn88 (84+5-1=88) we are at y88 = y87 (after action) = 9.\n\n            So we need to reach y=9 in 4 actions.\n\n                turn84: action0:U -> y85=5\n                turn85: action1:U -> y86=6\n                turn86: action2:U -> y87=7\n                turn87: action3:U -> y88=8 -> not 9.\n\n            We need 5 actions to get to 9: \n                action0:U ->5\n                action1:U ->6\n                action2:U ->7\n                action3:U ->8\n                action4:U ->9\n\n            then at turn89 we are at y=9.\n\n            and 84+5-1=88? -> then we are at turn88 at the beginning (before action4) at y=8, and after action4 at turn88 we are at y=9 at turn89.\n\n            So we are not at y=9 at turn88.\n\n            This indicates a misunderstanding.\n\n            Let me define:\n                Let s_t be the state at the start of turn t.\n                s_{84} = 4.\n                At turn84, we do a_{84}: then s_{85} = s_{84} + Δ.\n\n            So s_{85} = 4 + Δ.\n\n            In general, s_{84+k} = 4 + (number of U - number of D in the first k actions).\n\n            We require s_{84+H-1} = 9.\n\n            For example, with H=5, we require s_{84+4} = s_{88}=9.\n\n            How to achieve s_{88}=9? \n                s_{84}=4\n                s_{85}=4 + a0\n                s_{86}=4 + a0+a1\n                s_{87}=4 + a0+a1+a2\n                s_{88}=4 + a0+a1+a2+a3 = 9   -> so a0+a1+a2+a3 = 5.\n\n            Then we do an action a4 at turn88, which might change it, but we don't care.\n\n            So we need to have moved up 5 times in the first 4 actions? \n\n            But each action can only move up by 1. So a0+a1+a2+a3 is at most 4.\n\n            Therefore, s_{88} cannot be 9.\n\n            The earliest we can be at y=9 is at turn89, with 5 actions: \n                s_{89} = 4 + a0+a1+a2+a3+a4 = 9, so a0+..+a4=5.\n\n            Then we require \n                84+H-1 = 89 -> H = 89-84+1 = 6.\n\n            So with H=6, we want s_{84+6-1}=s_{89}=9.\n\n            And we do actions at turns84,85,86,87,88,89? \n                But the actions are for t=0 to 5 (6 actions), and then at turn89 we are at s_{89}=9.\n\n            How to achieve s_{89}=9 in 6 actions? \n                s_{89} = 4 + (net moves of 6 actions) = 9 -> net moves = 5.\n\n            So we need 5 Ups and 1 other action (which can be S or D) in the 6 actions.\n\n            Now, we have to avoid collisions at every turn from 84 to 89.\n\n            The state at each turn:\n              turn84: s84=4 -> freeway4: safe.\n              turn85: s85 = 4 + move0 -> could be 5 if move0=U.\n              turn86: s86 = s85 + move1\n              turn87: s87 = s86 + move2\n              turn88: s88 = s87 + move3\n              turn89: s89 = s88 + move4 = 9.\n\n            We require s89=9, and s88 must be 8 or 9 or 10? \n                s89 = s88 + move4, and move4 in { -1,0,1 }.\n                If s89=9, then:\n                  if move4 = U, then s88=8\n                  if move4 = S, then s88=9\n                  if move4 = D, then s88=10 -> not allowed.\n\n                So s88 is 8 or 9.\n\n            But at turn88, if we are at y=8 or 9, then for y=8 we check freeway8? \n                freeway8 at turn88 (k=4): unsafe.\n                for y=9: no freeway, safe.\n\n            So if we can be at y=9 at turn88, then we are safe at turn88.\n\n            How to be at y=9 at turn88? \n                s88 = 9.\n                then s89 = 9 + move4, and we don't care as long as we are at 9 at turn88.\n\n            But to be at s88=9, we need to have moved up 5 times in the first 4 actions? \n                s88 = 4 + (net moves of actions0 to action3) = 9 -> net moves=5 in 4 actions: impossible.\n\n            Therefore, s88 cannot be 9.\n\n            So the only possibility is s88=8, and then move4=U to get to 9 at turn89.\n\n            But then at turn88 we are at y=8 -> freeway8 at turn88: unsafe.\n\n            So for H=6, it is not possible.\n\n            For H=7: we require s_{84+7-1}=s_{90}=9.\n\n            Actions: 7 actions from turn84 to turn90.\n\n            s90 = 4 + (net moves of 7 actions) = 9 -> net moves = 5.\n\n            So we need 5 Ups and 2 other actions.\n\n            The state at turn89: s89 = ? and then s90 = s89 + move6 = 9.\n                move6 in { -1,0,1 }, so s89 = 8,9, or 10.\n\n            Only s89=8 is valid (because 9+0=9 or 8+1=9).\n\n            So we can have s89=8.\n\n            At turn89: if we are at y=8, then freeway8 at turn89 (k=5): safe.\n\n            How to be at y=8 at turn89? \n                s89 = 4 + (net moves of actions0 to action5) = 8 -> net moves of first 6 actions = 4.\n\n            So in 6 actions, we move up net 4 steps.\n\n            Then action6: U to 9.\n\n            Now, we need to avoid collisions at turn88: \n                at turn88, we are at s88 = ? \n                s89 = s88 + move5.\n                move5 in { -1,0,1 }, and s89=8.\n                So s88 could be 7,8,9.\n\n            At turn88: \n                if s88=7: freeway7 (unsafe)\n                if s88=8: freeway8 (unsafe)\n                if s88=9: safe.\n\n            So the only safe option is s88=9.\n\n            But then to have s88=9, we need net moves in the first 5 actions = 5? \n                s88 = 4 + (actions0 to action4) = 9 -> net=5 in 5 actions: possible with 5 Ups.\n\n            Then action5 at turn88: move5 = ? to go to s89=8 or 9 or 10.\n                But we need s89=8, so move5 = D? then s89=9-1=8.\n\n            But then at turn88, we are at s88=9 (safe, because no freeway at 9), and then we do D: to 8 at turn89.\n\n            Then at turn89: we are at y=8, which is safe for freeway8 at turn89.\n\n            Then action6: U to 9 at turn90.\n\n            So the sequence for H=7:\n\n               actions0 to action4: 5 Ups -> at turn88 (84+4=88? Let's see the turns: \n                    turn84: action0:U -> s85=5\n                    turn85: action1:U -> s86=6\n                    turn86: action2:U -> s87=7\n                    turn87: action3:U -> s88=8 -> but we need s88=9, not 8.\n\n            We are at 8 at turn88, not 9.\n\n            How to be at 9 at turn88? \n                s88 = 4 + (net of actions0 to action4) = 9.\n                actions0 to action4: turns84 to 88? \n                    action0 at turn84 -> s85 = 4+U=5\n                    action1 at turn85 -> s86=6\n                    action2 at turn86 -> s87=7\n                    action3 at turn87 -> s88=8\n                    action4 at turn88 -> s89 = ? \n\n            But we are defining s88 before action4? \n                s88 is the state at the beginning of turn88.\n                Then action4 is at turn88, and it produces s89.\n\n            So s88 = 8, not 9.\n\n            To have s88=9, we would need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn88, which means after action3 at turn87 we are at s88=9.\n\n            That requires net of 5 in the first 4 actions: impossible.\n\n            Therefore, we cannot have s88=9.\n\n            This means the only safe option for turn88 is not achievable.\n\n            So H=7 is not possible.\n\n            We try H=8: \n                s_{84+8-1}=s_{91}=9.\n                net moves of 8 actions = 5.\n                then we can have flexibility.\n\n                We need to avoid being on freeway5,6,7,8 at turn88 (k=4) for the car2.\n\n                and also avoid freeway4 at k=6,7,8.\n\n                But note, we might be on freeway4 at k=0 to 5 safe.\n\n                We want to be at y=9 at turn91.\n\n                We can try to be at a safe freeway at turn88.\n\n                For example, at turn88, be at y=4.\n\n                Then from turn88 to turn91: 3 actions to go from 4 to 9? -> 5 steps, so we need 5 actions? not possible.\n\n                or be at y=0 at turn88, then to 9 in 9 steps? no.\n\n            Given the complexity, and we have a safe 9-action sequence, I think we output that.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 9.\n\n        We output the sequence:\n\n          Turn 84: S\n          Turn 85: S\n          Turn 86: S\n          Turn 87: S\n          Turn 88: U\n          Turn 89: U\n          Turn 90: U\n          Turn 91: U\n          Turn 92: U\n\n        But note: at turn92, we do the last action, and we are at y=9 at turn92 (which is 84+8) and then after the action we are at turn93 at y=9 or 10? \n            But at turn92, we are at y=8 (because after 4 Ups from turn88 to turn91: \n                turn88: U ->89: y=5\n                turn89: U ->90: y=6\n                turn90: U ->91: y=7\n                turn91: U ->92: y=8\n            then at turn92: U ->93: y=9.\n\n        But we require to be at y=9 at turn92? \n            turn92 is 84+8.\n\n            s_{84+9-1}=s_{92}=9.\n\n            In our sequence, at the beginning of turn92, what is our y?\n                after action at turn91: we are at y92 = 8.\n            then we do action at turn92: U, and then at turn93 we are at 9.\n\n            So at turn92 (84+8) we are at 8, not 9.\n\n        How to be at 9 at turn92? \n            s92 = 9.\n            s92 = 4 + (actions0 to action7) = 9 -> net of 8 actions = 5.\n\n            actions0 to action7: we have 8 actions.\n\n            In our sequence, we have 4 S's and 4 U's in the first 8 actions? \n                actions0-3: S -> net 0\n                actions4-7: U -> net 4\n                total net=4, not 5.\n\n        So we need an extra U.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          turn84: U   // action0: net=1\n          turn85: S   // action1: net=1\n          turn86: S   // action2: net=1\n          turn87: S   // action3: net=1\n          turn88: U   // action4: net=2\n          turn89: U   // action5: net=3\n          turn90: U   // action6: net=4\n          turn91: U   // action7: net=5\n          then at turn92: we are at y92 = 4+5=9.\n\n        So we don't need an action at turn92.\n\n        But the sequence has to have 9 actions? for H=9, we output actions for turns84 to turn84+8=92.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          turn84: U\n          turn85: S\n          turn86: S\n          turn87: S\n          turn88: U\n          turn89: U\n          turn90: U\n          turn91: U\n          turn92: ?

\n\n        For 9 actions, we require to be at (0,9) at turn84+9-1= turn92.\n\n        with net=5 in 9 actions, we are at 4+5=9 at turn93, not at turn92.\n\n        unless the net of the first 8 actions is 5 and then the last action we do doesn't change it.\n\n        But then at turn92, we are at y=9 (at the beginning) and then we do an action (S, for example) and we are still at 9 at turn93.\n\n        so at turn92: we are at y=9.\n\n        Therefore, we must have net=5 after 8 actions: actions0 to action7.\n\n        then at turn92: we are at y=9, and we can do action8: S.\n\n        So how to have net=5 in actions0 to action7 (8 actions) and be at y=4 at turn88.\n\n        actions0 to action7: includes the first 4 actions (0 to 3) and then actions4 to 7.\n\n        for the first 4 actions, net=0 to be at y=4 at turn88.\n        then actions4 to 7: we need net=5 in these 4 actions: impossible (4 actions can only give net at most 4).\n\n        So we cannot achieve net=5 in 8 actions if the first 4 actions net 0.\n\n        We need the first 4 actions to net>=1.\n\n        then at turn88, we are at y=4+net0>=5.\n\n        then we need to net at least 5- net0 in the next 4 actions.\n\n        in 4 actions, we can net at most 4.\n\n        so we require net0 + 4 >= 5 -> net0>=1.\n\n        and then net0 + net1 = 5, where net1 is net of actions4 to 7.\n\n        net0>=1, net1>=5-net0, and net1<=4.\n\n        so net0=1, net1=4.\n\n        Example: net0=1 in first 4 actions, net1=4 in next 4 actions.\n\n        How to net0=1 in the first 4 actions and be at y=4 at turn88? \n            net0=1 means we are at 4+1=5 at turn88? \n\n        but we need to be at a safe freeway at turn88: y=5 is not safe.\n\n        So we cannot be at y=5 at turn88.\n\n        net0=1: we are at 5 at turn88 -> unsafe.\n\n        net0=0: we are at 4 at turn88 -> safe.\n\n        net0>=1 -> unsafe.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot achieve net=5 in 8 actions.\n\n        We must use 9 actions for net=5, and then we are at y=9 at turn93, and we require to be at 9 at turn92 (84+9-1=92) -> so at turn92, we are at y=9.\n\n        which means after 8 actions (actions0 to action7) we are at y=9 at turn92.\n\n        so net of 8 actions = 5.\n\n        and then action8 at turn92: we can do any action.\n\n        So we need to achieve net=5 in actions0 to action7.\n\n        with the constraint that at turn88 ( after 4 actions) we are at y=4.\n\n        actions0 to action3: net0 = ? to have at turn88 ( after action3 at turn87, state at turn88) = 4.\n        so net0 = 0.\n\n        then actions4 to action7: net1 = ? to have after action7 at turn91, state at turn92 = 4 + net0 + net1 = 4+net1 = 9 -> net1=5 in 4 actions: impossible.\n\n        So we cannot.\n\n        What if we are at a safe freeway at turn88, but not necessarily y=4? \n\n        The safe freeways at turn88 are y=1,2,3,4.\n\n        Suppose we are at y=3 at turn88.\n\n        then net0 = 3-4 = -1.\n\n        then we need actions4 to action7: net1 = 5 - net0 = 5 - (-1) = 6 in 4 actions: impossible.\n\n        Similarly for y=2: net0=2-4=-2, net1=7, impossible.\n\n        y=1: net0=1-4=-3, net1=8, impossible.\n\n        Therefore, the only safe option at turn88 is y=4, with net0=0.\n\n        then net1=5 in 4 actions: impossible.\n\n        This means we cannot achieve it in 9 actions that include being at a safe freeway at turn88 and then net5 in the next 4 actions.\n\n        But wait, we have actions4 to action7: four actions to net 5? -> cannot.\n\n        We have to achieve net=5 in the first 8 actions, but we have 8 actions for net=5.\n\n        In the first 4 actions, we net0=0 ( to be at y=4 at turn88).\n\n        in the next 4 actions (actions4 to action7), we net1=5? -> but we can only net1=4.\n\n        So we need an extra action somewhere.\n\n        How about we do 5 actions after turn88? \n\n        actions0 to action8: 9 actions.\n\n        net=5.\n\n        at turn88: after action3, we are at y=4.\n\n        then actions4 to action8: 5 actions to net the remaining 5: so 5 Ups.\n\n        then the net of actions0 to action8=0+5=5.\n\n        then at turn93: state is 4+5=9.\n\n        but we require to be at 9 at turn92 ( which is 84+9-1=92) -> at the beginning of turn92, we are at s92 = ? \n            actions0 to action7: net = actions0-3 (0) + actions4-7 (4) = 4.\n            so s92 = 4+4=8.\n\n        then action8 at turn92: U -> s93=9.\n\n        so at turn92, we are at 8, not 9.\n\n        To be at 9 at turn92, we need net=5 after actions0 to action7.\n\n        which, as above, is impossible if we are to be at y=4 at turn88.\n\n        Therefore, we must choose a sequence that is safe and has 9 actions, and we are at y=9 at turn93, and the turn for the requirement is turn92? -> but we are not at 9 at turn92.\n\n        This is a problem.\n\n        Let me which \n        We must be at (0,9) at turn84+H-1.\n\n        for H=9, turn84+8=92.\n\n        So at turn92, we must be at (0,9).\n\n        In our sequence of 9 actions, we are at turn92 for the last action.\n\n        At the beginning of turn92, we are at y92 = ? and then we do the last action.\n\n        After the action, we are at turn93, but we don't care.\n\n        The requirement is at the beginning of turn92 or after the action at turn92? \n\n        The problem: \"at turn84+H-1\"\n\n        and turn84+H-1 = 84+9-1=92.\n\n        At turn92, before any action, the state is y92.\n\n        We require y92=9.\n\n        So in 9 actions, we have to have y92=9.\n\n        which means the net of the first 8 actions (actions0 to action7) must be 5.\n\n        and then we do action8 at turn92, but that doesn't affect y92.\n\n        So we need net=5 in actions0 to action7.\n\n        with the constraint that at turn88 ( after 4 actions) we are at a safe freeway.\n\n        and at turn88, we are at y88 = 4 + net0, where net0 = net of actions0 to action3.\n\n        to be safe at turn88, we need y88 in {1,2,3,4} and for freeway4, we need to avoid its unsafe turns, but turn88 is k=4 for freeway4: safe (because for freeway4, k=4: [-19,-8] -> safe).\n\n        so net0 can be 0, -1, -2, -3.\n\n        then net of actions4 to action7 = 5 - net0.\n\n        since net0<=0, we need net1>=5.\n\n        but net1 ( actions4 to action7) is at most 4.\n\n        so net1<=4, and net0<=0, then net0+net1<=4<5.\n\n        Therefore, it is impossible.\n\n        This is a contradiction.\n\n        What is the resolution? \n\n        The only way is if we are not on a freeway at turn88, but we are on freeway1-8 at every turn from 84 to 91, except possibly when we are at y=0 or y=9.\n\n        at y=0 or 9, there is no freeway, so safe.\n\n        So if we can be at y=0 or y=9 at turn88, we are safe.\n\n        How to be at y=9 at turn88? \n            net of actions0 to action7 for turn88: impossible because we need net=5 in 4 actions for the first 4 actions to then have the next 4 actions net0, but 5 in 4 actions is impossible.\n\n        How to be at y=0 at turn88? \n            net0 = 0-4 = -4 in 4 actions: for example, 0 Ups and 4 Downs.\n            then net1 = 5 - net0 = 5 - (-4) = 9 in 4 actions: impossible.\n\n        Therefore, the only safe freeways at turn88 are 1,2,3,4, and we cannot achieve net=5 in 8 actions.\n\n        This means we must use H=10.\n\n        then at turn84+10-1= turn93, we want y93=9.\n\n        net of 10 actions = 5.\n\n        and at turn88, we can be at y=4.\n\n        net of actions0 to action3=0.\n        net of actions4 to action7 = net1, actions8 to action9 = net2.\n        then net0+net1+net2=5.\n        we need net1+net2=5.\n\n        in actions4 to action9: 6 actions, can net 6, so possible.\n\n        for example, actions4 to action9: 6 Ups: net=6, then in 10 actions: net=0+6=6>5, too much.\n\n        or 5 Ups and 1 S: net=5.\n\n        So a sequence:\n\n          actions0 to action3: net0=0 (e.g., S,S,S,S) -> at turn88: y=4.\n          actions4: U -> turn89: y=5.\n          actions5: U -> turn90: y=6.\n          actions6: U -> turn91: y=7.\n          actions7: U -> turn92: y=8.\n          actions8: U -> turn93: y=9.\n          actions9: any -> say S.\n\n        Then at turn93: we are at y=9.\n\n        Now check collisions:\n\n          turn88: y=4 -> freeway4 at turn88: k=4: safe.\n          turn89: y=5 -> freeway5 at turn89: k=5: safe.\n          turn90: y=6 -> freeway6 at turn90: k=6: safe.\n          turn91: y=7 -> freeway7 at turn91: k=7: safe.\n          turn92: y=8 -> freeway8 at turn92: k=8: safe.\n          turn93: y=9 -> safe.\n\n        So this is safe.\n\n        But is there a shorter H? \n\n        H=10.\n\n        We forH=9 we were not able.\n\n        So minimal H is 10.\n\n        But earlier we had a sequence for 9 actions that we thought was safe, but it was for being at 9 at turn93, not turn92.\n\n        So we must output a sequence for H=10.\n\n        sequence:\n\n          turn84: S\n          turn85: S\n          turn86: S\n          turn87: S\n          turn88: U\n          turn89: U\n          turn90: U\n          turn91: U\n          turn92: U\n          turn93: S   // any action, say S.\n\n        Then at turn93 (84+10-1=93) we are at y=9? \n            at the beginning of turn93: y93 = ? \n            after action at turn92: we are at y93 = 8 + action at turn92: which is U -> y93=9.\n            so at the beginning of turn93, we are at y93=9.\n\n        but we require at turn93 to be at 9, which is true.\n\n        However, the problem might interpret that as after the action at turn93, but the requirement is at turn93.\n\n        So in this sequence, at turn93 we are at 9.\n\n        And we do an action at turn93, but that's fine.\n\n        Therefore, we can use this sequence for H=10.\n\n        But is there a sequence with H=9 that is safe and has y92=9? \n            we would need net=5 in 8 actions.\n            and at turn88, we must be at a safe y (0,1,2,3,4,9) for that turn.\n            but at turn88, we are at the state after 4 actions, which is net0, and net0 in { -3,...,0} for safe y>=0.\n            then net1 = 5 - net0>=5.\n            and net1 must be delivered in 4 actions: impossible.\n\n        Therefore, minimal H is 10.\n\n        However, let me confirm with the net for the sequence above for H=10:\n\n          actions0: S -> net0=0\n          actions1: S -> net0=0\n          actions2: S -> net0=0\n          actions3: S -> net0=0\n          actions4: U -> net=1\n          actions5: U -> net=2\n          actions6: U -> net=3\n          actions7: U -> net=4\n          actions8: U -> net=5\n          actions9: S -> net=5\n\n          so at the beginning of turn93, we are at 4+5=9.\n\n        turn93 = 84+10-1=93.\n\n        So it meets.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal number of turns H is 10.\n\n        We output the sequence of 10 actions.\n\n        But note: the initial safe sequence for 9 actions (which ended at turn93) is not valid because for H=9, we require to be at 9 at turn92, which is not met.\n\n        So the answer is 10 actions.\n\n        However, let us see if we can do it in 10 actions with movement in the first 4 actions as long as we are at a safe freeway at turn88.\n\n        For example, to avoid the boredom of 4 S's, we can do:\n\n          turn84: U\n          turn85: D\n          turn86: S\n          turn87: S\n          turn88: at y=4 ( because 4 +1-1=4) -> safe.\n          then the same as above.\n\n        sequence:\n\n          turn84: U\n          turn85: D\n          turn86: S\n          turn87: S\n          turn88: U\n          turn89: U\n          turn90: U\n          turn91: U\n          turn92: U\n          turn93: S\n\n        and net = +1-1+0+0+1+1+1+1+1+0 = 5.\n\n        now check collisions:\n\n          turn84: y=4 (before action) -> safe.\n                after action: U -> to 5 at turn85.\n          turn85: before action: y=5.\n                freeway5 at turn85: k=1: safe.\n                action: D -> to 4 at turn86.\n          turn86: before action: y=4.\n                freeway4 at turn86: k=2: safe.\n                action: S -> to 4 at turn87.\n          turn87: before action: y=4.\n                freeway4 at turn87: k=3: safe.\n                action: S -> to 4 at turn88.\n          turn88: before action: y=4.\n                freeway4 at turn88: k=4: safe.\n                action: U -> to 5 at turn89.\n          turn89: before action: y=5.\n                freeway5 at turn89: k=5: safe.\n                action: U -> to 6 at turn90.\n          turn90: before action: y=6.\n                freeway6 at turn90: k=6: safe.\n                action: U -> to 7 at turn91.\n          turn91: before action: y 7.\n                freeway7 at turn91: k=7: safe.\n                action: U -> to 8 at turn92.\n          turn92: before action: y=8.\n                freeway8 at turn92: k=8: safe.\n                action: U -> to 9 at turn93.\n          turn93: before action: y=9.\n                safe.\n                action: S.\n\n        This is safe.\n\n        So we can use either sequence.\n\n        I'll choose the one with moves.\n\n        So the answer is:\n\n          Turn 84: U\n          Turn 85: D\n          Turn 86: S\n          Turn 87: S\n          Turn 88: U\n          Turn 89: U\n          Turn 90: U\n          Turn 91: U\n          Turn 92: U\n          Turn 93: S\n\n        But note: the last action ( turn93: S) is necessary to complete the 10 actions.\n\n        And we are at (0,9) at turn93.\n\n        turn93 = 84+10-1 = 93, yes.\n\n        So this is valid.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal number of turns H is 10.\n\n        We output the sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn 84 in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, the minimal number of turns required is 10. The sequence of actions ensures the player avoids collisions at every turn, particularly by not being on freeways 5, 6, 7, or 8 at turn 88 (when the cars on these freeways would cause a collision at x=0), and instead stays at y=4 (a safe freeway) at turn 88. The actions are designed to move the player up to y=9 by turn 93.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 84, move up to y=5.\n- At turn 85, move down to y=4 to ensure safety at upcoming turns.\n- At turns 86 and 87, stay to remain at y=4, avoiding freeways 5-8 at turn 88.\n- From turns 88 to 92, move up five times to reach y=9 by turn 93.\n- At turn 93, any action can be taken (e.g., stay) since the goal is already achieved.\n\nThis sequence ensures:\n- At turn 88, the player is at y=4 (freeway 4), which is safe because the cars on freeway 4 at turn 88 (k=4) are at [-19, -8], [17, 28], and [53, 64], none containing x=0.\n- After turn 88, moving up avoids collisions: freeways 5-8 at turns 89-92 (k=5 to 8) have cars at positions that do not include x=0.\n\nThe actions are:\n\n```\nTurn 84: U\nTurn 85: D\nTurn 86: S\nTurn 87: S\nTurn 88: U\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: S\n```\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn 84: } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn 85: } D \\\\\n\\text{Turn 86: } S \\\\\n\\text{Turn 87: } S \\\\\n\\text{Turn 88: } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn 89: } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn 90: } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn 91: } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn 92: } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn 93: } S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn 88 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays, and the cars move left or right at their speeds.\n\nFirst, since I start at y=0 and need to get to y=9, I have to move up through each freeway level. But I have to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at position 0 on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe collision rule says: collision occurs at turn T if for the freeway y_T, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. And importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nAlso, the car positions are given at turn t_1=88, and I need to find their positions at future turns based on their direction and speed.\n\nLet me list all the cars and their positions at turn 88.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, head -48, tail -59, direction right, speed 3. Since it's moving right, the span is [tail, head] = [-59, -48] at t=88. Direction right means it's moving to the right, so position increases. The update rule: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, it would be [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn this case, all cars seem to be right-moving except possibly, but let's see.\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3). Head is -48, tail is -59. Since direction right, head is the front, so at t=88, span is [tail, head] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-59 + 3(T-88), -48 + 3(T-88)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3) so same as above.\n\nFreeway 3: same.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: (-48, -59, right, 4), (-12, -23, right, 4), (24, 13, right, 4)\n\nFor each, at t=88, span:\n\nFirst car: [-59, -48]? Tail -59, head -48, direction right, so span [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nSimilarly, second car: tail -23, head -12? (-12, -23, right, 4) so head -12, tail -23, so span [-23, -12]\n\nThird car: (24, 13, right, 4) head 24, tail 13, span [13,24]\n\nBut at t=88.\n\nNow at time T, for each car:\n\nFirst car: [ -59 + 4(T-88), -48 + 4(T-88) ]\n\nSecond car: [ -23 + 4(T-88), -12 + 4(T-88) ]\n\nThird car: [ 13 + 4(T-88), 24 + 4(T-88) ]\n\nFreeway 5: (-48, -59, right, 12), and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head -48, tail -59, right, speed 12, span at t=88: [-59, -48]\n\nSecond car: (0, -11, right, 12) head 0, tail -11, so span [-11, 0] at t=88.\n\nHead is 0, tail -11, so at t=88, position 0 is included? Span [-11,0], so 0 is the head, which is included.\n\nCollision if at turn T, for freeway y_T, 0 is in some car's span on that freeway.\n\nFor freeway 5, at t=88, there is a car with span [-11,0], so if I were on freeway 5 at t=88, I would collide, but I'm at y=0, not on freeway, so ok. But for future turns.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 6,7,8 have the same: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5, etc.\n\nNow, I start at (0,0) at turn 88. y=0 is not a freeway, I think freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nI need to reach (0,9), which is also safe.\n\nThe path is from y=0 to y=9, moving through y=1 to 8, but I have to be careful when I'm on each y level that no car is at position 0 at that turn.\n\nAlso, I can move up, down, or stay, so I can wait or move down if needed to avoid collisions.\n\nBut since I need to go up, moving down might not be efficient, but sometimes necessary to dodge.\n\nThe goal is to minimize H, the number of turns.\n\nFirst, since I start at y=0 at t=88, I can choose to move up to y=1 at some turn, or stay.\n\nLet t be the turn number relative to t1=88, so let τ = T - 88, so at τ=0, t=88.\n\nPlayer position: at τ=0, y=0.\n\nI need to get to y=9 at some τ = H-1, so at turn t1 + (H-1).\n\ny_{t1 + H-1} =9.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when it is safe to be on that freeway, meaning that at that turn, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nFor freeway k, at time τ (relative to t1), the span for each car.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, right, speed 3, span at τ: [ -59 + 3τ, -48 + 3τ ]\n\nCollision if 0 is in this interval: -59 + 3τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 3τ\n\nSolve:\n\n-59 + 3τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 3τ ≤ 59 ⇒ τ ≤ 59/3 ≈ 19.666, so τ ≤ 19 since τ integer? τ is turn offset, integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ -48 + 3τ ⇒ 48 ≤ 3τ ⇒ τ ≥ 16\n\nSo for τ from 16 to 19 inclusive, 0 is in [ -59+3τ, -48+3τ ]\n\nFor τ=16: -59+48 = -11? -59+3*16 = -59+48 = -11, -48+48=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nτ=17: -59+51= -8, -48+51=3, [-8,3], 0 in\n\nτ=18: -59+54= -5, -48+54=6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nτ=19: -59+57= -2, -48+57=9, [-2,9], 0 in\n\nτ=20: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nτ=15: -59+45= -14, -48+45= -3, [-14,-3], 0 not in\n\nSo unsafe for τ=16,17,18,19.

Similarly at y=9, only D or S.\n\nIn this case, start at y=0, so actions: U or S.\n\nSimilarly, end at y=9.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, I need to increase y from 0 to 9, so net +9, each U gives +1, S or D give 0 or -1, so to minimize turns, I should avoid S and D, and use as many U as possible.\n\nBut I may need to S or D to avoid being on unsafe freeway at bad times.\n\nMinimal H: if no cars, I could go up each turn, from τ=0 to τ=8, y from 0 to 8 at τ=1 to 8, then at τ=8, y=8, I need to go to y=9, so at τ=8 take U, y_9=9, so H=9 turns, from τ=0 to τ=8, positions from y_0=0 to y_8=8? Let's see:\n\nτ=0: y_0=0, take action\n\nτ=1: y_1, after action\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at τ=H, y_H.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H-1} =9, so at relative turn τ = H-1, y_{H-1}=9.\n\nFor example, if I take U each turn starting from τ=0:\n\nAt τ=0: take U, y_1 =1\n\nτ=1: take U, y_2=2\n\n...\n\nAfter k U actions, y_k = k\n\nSo to have y_m =9, I need m=9, so at τ=9, y_9=9, so H-1=9, H=10, turns from τ=0 to τ=9, but the position y_τ for τ from 0 to 9.\n\ny_0=0, y_1=1, ..., y_9=9.\n\nThe turn when position is set: at turn τ, y_τ is the position, and collision checked.\n\nFor y_9=9, which is safe.\n\nThe number of actions: from τ=0 to τ=8, I take 9 actions to go from y_0=0 to y_9=9 in 9 steps? Let's count:\n\nAt τ=0: y_0=0, I take a_0, which sets y_1.\n\nAfter first action, at τ=1, y_1 is set.\n\nTo have y_k = k for k=1 to 9, I need to take U from τ=0 to τ=8, so actions at τ=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8: 9 actions, y from y_1=1 to y_9=9, and y_0=0.\n\nThen at τ=H-1=9, y_9=9, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThe sequence has H actions: from t=0 to H-1 relative, setting y from y_1 to y_H.\n\ny_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, but y_{t1 + t} is the position at that turn.\n\nIn the sequence, for t from 0 to H-1, position at turn t1+t.\n\nAt t=0 (τ=0), position (0, y_{t1}) = (0,0)\n\nAfter actions, at turn t1+t, position y_{t1+t}\n\nWe need at turn t1 + (H-1), position y_{t1 + H-1} =9.\n\nSo relative τ, at τ = H-1, y_{H-1} =9.\n\nThe actions are taken at turns τ=0 to τ=H-2, affecting y at τ=1 to τ=H-1.\n\nAt τ=0, position y_0=0, I take action a_0, which determines y_1.\n\nAt τ=1, position y_1, I take a_1, determines y_2, and so on, up to at τ=H-2, take a_{H-2}, determines y_{H-1}.\n\nAnd at τ=H-1, position y_{H-1}=9, and no action taken at τ=H-1, I think, since actions from t=0 to H-1, but the last action sets the position.\n\nLet's read the action sequence: {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nAt each turn t1 + t, I take action a_{t1+t}, which determines the next position.\n\nSo at turn T = t1 + t, I am at position y_T, take action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nFor turn T, position y_T.\n\nAt the last turn, when I reach y=9, I am at position y_T=9 for some T, and I don't take action after that, but the sequence includes actions up to when I set y to 9.\n\nIn the sequence, I take actions at turns t1 to t1+H-1, and after H actions, the position at turn t1+H is set to 9? Let's see.\n\nSuppose I start at turn t1, position y_{t1} =0.\n\nI take action a_{t1} at turn t1, which sets y_{t1+1}.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}, take action a_{t1+1}, set y_{t1+2}, and so on, up to take action a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1, which sets y_{t1+H}.\n\nThen, we want y_{t1+H} =9, so at turn t1+H, position is 9.\n\nBut the turn when I am at (0,9) is turn t1+H, and I took H actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThe position at turn t1+H is after the last action.\n\nFor collision, at each turn from t1 to t1+H, position y_{t1+k} for k=0 to H must be safe, but at k=0, y=0 safe, at k=H, y=9 safe, and for k=1 to H-1, if y between 1-8, must be safe at that turn.\n\nTurn t1+H, position y_{t1+H}=9, safe.\n\nThe actions are taken at turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nIn relative τ: τ from 0 to H.\n\nAt τ=0, position y_0=0 (safe)\n\nTake action a_0, set y_1\n\nAt τ=1, position y_1, must be safe if on freeway\n\nTake action a_1, set y_2\n\n...\n\nAt τ=H-1, position y_{H-1}, must be safe if on freeway\n\nTake action a_{H-1}, set y_H =9\n\nAt τ=H, position y_H=9, safe, and no action taken.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions are from τ=0 to τ=H-1, and we need y_H=9.\n\nFor the position at τ=H, it is set, but we don't take action at τ=H.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn τ for position y_τ.\n\nFor τ from 0 to H, y_τ must be safe.\n\ny_0=0 safe, y_H=9 safe.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=H-1.\n\nNow, to have y_H=9, and y_0=0, the number of U actions must be 9, and D actions must be 0, S actions add turns.\n\nEach S or D adds an extra turn without net progress.\n\nTo minimize H, I should avoid S and D, only use U, so that I reach in minimal steps.\n\nWith only U, I need 9 U actions to go from y_0=0 to y_9=9, with y_1=1, y_2=2, ..., y_9=9.\n\nH would be 9, since y_9=9 at τ=9, so H-1? No.\n\ny_H =9, so if y_k for k from 0 to H.\n\ny_0=0, y_1=1, ..., y_9=9, so H=9, τ from 0 to 9, position at τ=9 is 9.\n\nActions at τ=0 to τ=8, 9 actions? Let's list:\n\nτ: position y_τ set at start of turn.\n\nAt τ=0: y_0=0\n\nTake a_0, say U, then y_1 = y_0 +1 =1\n\nAt τ=1: y_1=1\n\nTake a_1=U, y_2=2\n\n...\n\nAt τ=8: y_8=8\n\nTake a_8=U, y_9=9\n\nAt τ=9: y_9=9\n\nSo to have y_9=9, I need actions from τ=0 to τ=8, 9 actions, and H=9, since actions from t=0 to H-1, so H-1=8? Confusion.\n\nDefine H as the number of turns from start to end.\n\nFrom the problem: \"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo at turn t1 + (H-1), position is 9.\n\nIn relative τ, at τ = H-1, y_{H-1} =9.\n\nFor example, if I reach at τ=9, y_9=9, then H-1=9, so H=10.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=8 for t=0 to 8, 9 actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, with all U, y_1=1, y_2=2, ..., y_8=8 at τ=1 to 8, y_9=9 at τ=9.\n\nAt τ=H-1=9, y_9=9, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThe positions from τ=1 to 8 are on freeways, must be safe at those turns.\n\ny_1=1 at τ=1, must be safe for freeway 1 at τ=1.\n\ny_2=2 at τ=2, safe for freeway 2, and so on.\n\nIn general, for all U, I am on y=k at τ=k for k=1 to 8, and I need each of these to be safe at that τ.\n\nBut from the unsafe times, at τ=1, y=1: freeway 1 unsafe at τ=16-19, not at 1, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, τ=2, y=2, safe.\n\nBut for example, y=4 at τ=4: freeway 4 unsafe at τ=3,4,5,12,13,14, so at τ=4, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at τ=5: freeway 5 unsafe only at τ=4, not 5, so safe.\n\nLet's check for all U at τ=k for y=k:\n\nτ=1, y=1: freeway 1 unsafe 16-19, not 1, safe\n\nτ=2, y=2: safe\n\nτ=3, y=3: freeway 3 unsafe 16-19, not 3, safe\n\nτ=4, y=4: freeway 4 unsafe at 3,4,5, so τ=4 unsafe, collision!\n\nτ=5, y=5: freeway 5 unsafe only at τ=4, not 5, safe\n\nτ=6, y=6: unsafe only at τ=4, not 6, safe\n\nτ=7, y=7: safe\n\nτ=8, y=8: safe\n\nSo only problem at τ=4, y=4, which is unsafe.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=4 at τ=4.\n\nWith all U, I am on y=4 at τ=4, which is bad.\n\nSo I need to adjust.\n\nI could stay at some level or move down, but that might cost extra turns.\n\nSince y=4 is unsafe at τ=4, I can be on y=4 at a different time.\n\nFor example, I can delay moving to y=4 or go earlier.\n\nWith all U, I reach y=4 at τ=4.\n\nI can arrive at y=4 later or earlier.\n\nFor instance, if I stay at y=3 for one turn.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=0, take S or U.\n\nIf I take U at τ=0, y_1=1\n\nThen at τ=1, y=1, I can take S to stay, so y_2=1, then at τ=2, take U to y=2, and so on.\n\nBut let's see the times.\n\nI need to be on y=4 when it is safe.\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe at τ=3,4,5,12,13,14, so safe before τ=3 or after τ=5 until τ=11, or after τ=14.\n\nτ=0,1,2,6,7,8,9,10,11,15,... etc.\n\nNow, for the path, I need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be 10 if I can avoid the collision with one stay or something.\n\nBut at τ=4, with all U, I am on y=4, unsafe.\n\nIf I can be on a different y at τ=4.\n\nFor example, at τ=4, if I am on y=3 or y=5, etc.\n\ny=5 is safe at τ=5, but at τ=4, y=5: freeway 5 unsafe at τ=4, so not safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at τ=4: freeway 3 unsafe at 16-19, not at 4, so safe.\n\ny=6 at τ=4: unsafe, since freeway 6 unsafe at τ=4.\n\nLet's list for each y, when it is safe to be on that y.\n\ny=1: safe except τ=16,17,18,19\n\ny=2: same, except 16-19\n\ny=3: same, except 16-19\n\ny=4: unsafe at τ=3,4,5,12,13,14; so safe at τ=0,1,2,6,7,8,9,10,11,15,16,... but at τ=16, y=4 may be safe, but y=1,2,3 are unsafe at 16-19, so for y=4, at τ=16 it is safe, since not in unsafe times.\n\ny=4 unsafe only at 3,4,5,12,13,14, so at τ=16, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5: unsafe only at τ=4, so safe at all other times.\n\ny=6: same, unsafe only τ=4, safe else.\n\ny=7: same.\n\ny=8: same.\n\nNow back to the path.\n\nI need to be on each y from 1 to 8 at some point, but not necessarily at fixed τ.\n\nFor example, I can be on y=4 at τ=2 or τ=6, etc.\n\nIn the all U path, I am on each y at τ=y.\n\nBut at y=4, τ=4 is bad.\n\nSo I can, for example, stay at y=3 for one turn to delay.\n\nSo: start τ=0, y=0, take U, so y_1=1\n\nτ=1, y=1, take U, y_2=2\n\nτ=2, y=2, take U, y_3=3\n\nτ=3, y=3, now instead of U, take S, so y_4=3 (still on y=3)\n\nThen at τ=4, y=3, which is safe, since y=3 unsafe only at 16-19.\n\nThen at τ=4, take U, so y_5=4\n\nNow at τ=5, y=4, is it safe? τ=5, freeway 4 unsafe at τ=5, which is in 3,4,5, so unsafe! τ=5 is unsafe for y=4.\n\nProblem.\n\ny_5=4 at τ=5, which is unsafe.\n\nIf at τ=3 I take S, y_4=3, then at τ=4 take U, y_5=4, but at τ=5, y=4, which is unsafe if τ=5.\n\nτ=5 is in unsafe for y=4.\n\nAt τ=5 position y_5=4.\n\nBut in this case, at τ=5, y=4, and τ=5 is unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nAfter staying at τ=3, at τ=4 y=3, take U to y_5=4, but y_5=4 at τ=5? Let's see the position at which turn.\n\nAt τ=3, position y_3=3\n\nTake action a_3=S, so y_4 = y_3 + 0 =3\n\nAt τ=4, position y_4=3\n\nTake action a_4=U, so y_5 = y_4 +1 =4\n\nAt τ=5, position y_5=4\n\nSo y=4 at τ=5, which is unsafe.\n\nIf I take U at τ=4, y_5=4, position at τ=5 is y=4.\n\nBut τ=5 is unsafe for y=4.\n\nTo avoid, I need to be on y=4 at a different time, say earlier or later.\n\nFor example, be on y=4 at τ=2 or τ=6.\n\nWith all U, I am at y=4 at τ=4.\n\nIf I can be faster or slower.\n\nTo be earlier: from y=0, I need to reach y=4 sooner.\n\nBut I start at y=0, I can only move up one per turn, so earliest to be on y=4 is at τ=4 if I go directly.\n\nAt τ=4, y=4.\n\nBut that's unsafe.\n\nAt τ=4, I could be on a different y.\n\nFor example, if I stay at lower levels.\n\nBut let's list the positions over time.\n\nI need to have for each τ, y_τ not on an unsafe freeway.\n\nSpecifically, for τ=4, which freeways are unsafe.\n\nAt τ=4:\n\ny=4: unsafe\n\ny=5: unsafe\n\ny=6: unsafe\n\ny=7: unsafe\n\ny=8: unsafe\n\ny=1,2,3: safe, since unsafe only at 16-19\n\ny=4 to 8 all unsafe at τ=4 except y=4 is unsafe, y=5 unsafe, etc.\n\ny=1,2,3 safe at τ=4.\n\ny=4 unsafe, y=5 unsafe, y=6 unsafe, y=7 unsafe, y=8 unsafe.\n\nSo at τ=4, only safe to be on y=0,1,2,3 or 9, but 9 not yet.\n\nOr not on freeway, y=0 or 9.\n\nBut I am on the way, so probably on y=1,2,3 or stay at y=0.\n\nSimilarly, at other times.\n\nTo avoid τ=4, I can be on y=3 at τ=4, for example.\n\nThen I can proceed.\n\nAlso, for y=4, I need to be on it when safe, say at τ=2 or τ=6, etc.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, let's plan a path with minimal delay.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=0.\n\nI can take U at τ=0, so y_1=1\n\nτ=1, y=1, take U, y_2=2\n\nτ=2, y=2, take U, y_3=3\n\nNow at τ=3, y=3, I need to decide.\n\nIf I take U at τ=3, y_4=4, but at τ=4, y=4, unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nTake S at τ=3, so y_4=3 (position at τ=4 is y=3, safe)\n\nThen at τ=4, y=3, I can take U, so y_5=4\n\nBut at τ=5, y=4, and τ=5 is unsafe for y=4, since freeway 4 unsafe at τ=5.\n\nτ=5 is in 3,4,5? τ=3,4,5 unsafe for y=4.\n\nSo y=4 at τ=5 unsafe.\n\nTake D? From y=3, take D, y_4=2, then at τ=4, y=2, safe, then at τ=4, take U to y_5=3, etc, but that seems worse.\n\nTo be on y=4 at a safe time, say τ=6.\n\nτ=6 is safe for y=4.\n\nSo, for example, I can reach y=3 at τ=3, then stay at y=3 for a few turns until I can go to y=4 at a safe time.\n\nBut I need to go to y=4 when safe, and also consider later levels.\n\nFirst, let's get to y=3 quickly.\n\nFrom start: τ=0, y=0, a=U, y_1=1\n\nτ=1, y=1, a=U, y_2=2\n\nτ=2, y=2, a=U, y_3=3\n\nNow at τ=3, y=3, I can take S to stay, so y_4=3\n\nAt τ=4, y=3, take S again? Or U?\n\nBut I want to go to y=4 at τ=6 or something.\n\ny=4 safe at τ=6.\n\nSo at τ=4, I can take U to y_5=4, but then at τ=5, y=4, which is unsafe if τ=5.\n\nτ=5 is unsafe for y=4.\n\nSo I cannot go to y=4 at τ=5.\n\nI need to go at τ=6.\n\nSo at τ=4, y=3 (if I stayed), take S or something.\n\nFrom τ=3, y=3, take S at τ=3, y_4=3\n\nThen at τ=4, y=3, take S at τ=4, y_5=3\n\nThen at τ=5, y=3, take U at τ=5, y_6=4\n\nAt τ=6, y=4, which is safe for freeway 4, since τ=6 not in unsafe.\n\nThen I can proceed up.\n\nBut I have added two extra turns at y=3.\n\nThen from τ=6, y=4, take U, y_7=5\n\nτ=7, y=5, take U, y_8=6\n\nτ=8, y=6, take U, y_9=7\n\nτ=9, y=7, take U, y_10=8\n\nτ=10, y=8, take U, y_11=9\n\nThen at τ=11, y_11=9, so y_{H-1}=9, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nBut earlier with all U I could have H=10 but for the collision, now H=12, which is worse.\n\nI can go faster by not staying too long.\n\nFor example, go to y=4 earlier.\n\nEarliest to be on y=4 is at τ=4 with U,U,U,U from start.\n\nBut unsafe.\n\nI can be on y=4 at τ=2? How? From y=0, to y=4 in two steps? Impossible, since each U increases by 1, so minimum 4 steps to be on y=4 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=4 is the earliest.\n\nBut unsafe.\n\nNext safe time for y=4 is τ=6, as above.\n\nBut I can be on y=4 at τ=1? No, from y=0, at τ=1 y=1, not 4.\n\nSo positions: I can be on y=4 only from τ=4 onwards, with the first possible at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4,5 unsafe, so next safe is τ=6.\n\nSo I must be on y=4 at τ=6 or later.\n\nSimilarly, for other levels.\n\nBut I also have the later unsafe times for y=1,2,3 at τ=16-19, but that is late, so probably not an issue if I go fast.\n\nFirst, let's handle the early part.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nAnother idea: skip y=4 at the critical time by being on a different level.\n\nFor example, at τ=4, be on y=3 or y=2, etc.\n\nBut y=5 is unsafe at τ=4, so I cannot be on y=5 at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, y=6,7,8 unsafe at τ=4.\n\nOnly y=0,1,2,3 safe at τ=4.\n\nSo at τ=4, I should be on y=1,2, or 3.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=5, y=4 is unsafe, y=5,6,7,8 are safe except y=4 is the only one unsafe at τ=5 for freeway 4, but y=5 is safe at τ=5, etc.\n\nAt τ=5: freeway 4 unsafe, so y=4 unsafe.\n\nFreeway 5 safe at τ=5, since only unsafe at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6,7,8 safe.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3 safe at τ=5.\n\nSo at τ=5, only y=4 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=3, freeway 4 unsafe, so y=4 unsafe, but at τ=3, I might not be on y=4 yet.\n\nIn the path, I can be on y=3 at τ=3 and τ=4, then to y=4 at τ=6.\n\nBut that costs two extra turns.\n\nI could go to higher levels faster after.\n\nBut let's see the actions.\n\nFrom τ=0 to τ=2, I go up to y=3 as before.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=3, I take S, so y_4=3\n\nAt τ=4, y=3, take S, y_5=3\n\nAt τ=5, y=3, take U, y_6=4  (now at τ=6, y=4 safe)\n\nThen from here, I can go up each turn.\n\nAt τ=6, y=4, take U, y_7=5\n\nτ=7, y=5, take U, y_8=6\n\nτ=8, y=6, take U, y_9=7\n\nτ=9, y=7, take U, y_10=8\n\nτ=10, y=8, take U, y_11=9\n\nAt τ=11, y_11=9, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nBut is there a way with less than 12?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=4 at τ=6 without staying twice at y=3.\n\nBut from y=3, to be at y=4 at τ=6, I need to have position at τ=6 be y=4.\n\nSo at τ=5, position y_5, take action to set y_6=4.\n\nSo if at τ=5, y_5=3 or 4 or 5, but if y_5=3, take U to y_6=4; if y_5=4, take S or something, but we want to set y_6=4, so if y_5=4, take S, y_6=4; if y_5=3, take U, y_6=4; if y_5=5, take D, y_6=4, but moving down is inefficient.\n\nBest to be at y=3 at τ=5, take U to y_6=4.\n\nHow to be at y=3 at τ=5.\n\nNormally, with all U, at τ=3 y=3.\n\nIf I delay earlier.\n\nFor example, start at τ=0, y=0, take S instead of U, so y_1=0\n\nThen at τ=1, y=0, take U, y_2=1\n\nThen at τ=2, y=1, take U, y_3=2\n\nτ=3, y=2, take U, y_4=3\n\nτ=4, y=3, take U, y_5=4? But at τ=5, y=4, unsafe.\n\nSame issue.\n\nFrom above, at τ=4, y=3, I can take U to y_5=4, but τ=5 y=4 unsafe.\n\nTo have y_6=4, I need at τ=5 to be at y=3 or 4 or 5.\n\nIf at τ=5, y=3, then take U to y_6=4.\n\nHow to be at y=3 at τ=5.\n\nNormally at τ=3 y=3, so I can stay at y=3 for two turns: at τ=3 and τ=4 take S, so at τ=4 y=3, then at τ=4 take S? At τ=3, take S, y_4=3; at τ=4, take S, y_5=3; then at τ=5, y=3, take U, y_6=4.\n\nAs before.\n\nIf I can reach y=3 later.\n\nBut I start from below, so I can only reach y=3 at τ=3 or later with delays.\n\nSo minimum to be at y=3 at τ=5 is to have two S at lower levels or something, but that might add more turns.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, take S, y_1=0\n\nτ=1, take U, y_2=1\n\nτ=2, take U, y_3=2\n\nτ=3, take U, y_4=3\n\nThen at τ=4, y=3, take S, y_5=3\n\nThen at τ=5, y=3, take U, y_6=4\n\nSame as before, but I added one S at start, so I am at y=3 at τ=4 instead of τ=3, then stay at τ=4 to y_5=3, then to y_6=4.\n\nPositions: y_1=0, y_2=1, y_3=2, y_4=3, y_5=3, y_6=4\n\nThen from here to y=9.\n\ny_6=4, take U, y_7=5\n\ny_7=5, take U, y_8=6\n\ny_8=6, take U, y_9=7\n\ny_9=7, take U, y_10=8\n\ny_10=8, take U, y_11=9\n\nAt τ=11, y_11=9, H-1=11, H=12, same as before.\n\nWith the first method, I had y_3=3, y_4=3, y_5=3, y_6=4, so from y_3 to y_6, three turns to go from 3 to 4, whereas normally one turn, so two extra turns.\n\nIn this, from y_4=3 to y_6=4, two turns for one level, one extra turn.\n\nBut in both cases, I have y_11=9, H=12.\n\nBut I can save time on the upper levels.\n\nNotice that for y=5,6,7,8, they are only unsafe at τ=4, which is early, so after τ=4, they are always safe.\n\ny=5 safe for τ!=4, similarly for 6,7,8.\n\nSo once I am past y=4, I can go up fast.\n\nThe bottleneck is getting past y=4 safely.\n\nI need to be on y=4 at a time when it is safe, like τ=6 or 7, etc.\n\nThe earliest safe time for y=4 is τ=6, since τ=0,1,2 are too early to be on y=4, as I am at lower levels.\n\nAt τ=6, I can be on y=4.\n\nTo be on y=4 at τ=6, I need to have y_6=4.\n\nSo at τ=5, I must be at y=3 or 4 or 5.\n\nIf at τ=5, y=3, take U to y_6=4.\n\nIf at τ=5, y=4, take S to y_6=4.\n\nBut at τ=5, if y=4, it is unsafe, since freeway 4 unsafe at τ=5.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=4 at τ=5, so I must be at y=3 at τ=5 and take U to y_6=4.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be at y=5 at τ=5 because if I take D to y_6=4, but at τ=5, if I am on y=5, it is safe, but taking D is inefficient.\n\nSo best to be at y=3 at τ=5.\n\nHow to be at y=3 at τ=5.\n\nNormally at τ=3 y=3.\n\nSo I need to add two turns of delay before or at y=3.\n\nFor example, stay at some lower level for two turns.\n\nBut I can stay at y=3 for two turns, or at y=2 or y=1 or y=0.\n\nSince y=1,2,3 are safe at early times, I can stay at one of them.\n\nFor example, start at τ=0, y=0, take U, y_1=1\n\nτ=1, y=1, take U, y_2=2\n\nτ=2, y=2, now I can take S to stay at y=2 for one turn, so at τ=2, take S, y_3=2\n\nThen at τ=3, y=2, take U, y_4=3\n\nAt τ=4, y=3, take U, y_5=4? But at τ=5, y=4, unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt τ=2, take S, y_3=2\n\nτ=3, y=2, take U, y_4=3\n\nτ=4, y=3, take S, y_5=3\n\nτ=5, y=3, take U, y_6=4\n\nThen same as before.\n\nAt τ=0, take S, y_1=0\n\nτ=1, y=0, take U, y_2=1\n\nτ=2, y=1, take U, y_3=2\n\nτ=3, y=2, take U, y_4=3\n\nτ=4, y=3, take S, y_5=3\n\nτ=5, y=3, take U, y_6=4\n\nThen from y_6=4, take U, y_7=5\n\nAnd so on to y_11=9 as before.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut I think I can do with H=10 or 11.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=4 at τ=6, but without adding two turns, by moving faster later, but I can't move faster than one per turn.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=4 at τ=1, but impossible.\n\nOr, I can avoid being on freeway at all at τ=4 and τ=5, but for y=4 and y=5, but I have to pass through.\n\nAt τ=4, I can be on y=3, which is safe, and at τ=5, I can be on y=5, which is safe at τ=5, but I need to go from y=3 to y=5 in one step? No, I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nFrom y=3 at τ=4, I can take U to y_5=4 at τ=5, but y=4 at τ=5 unsafe.\n\nOr take D to y=2, worse.\n\nSo I cannot skip y=4.\n\nI have to be on y=4 at some point, and it must be at a safe time, like τ=6.\n\nTo be on y=4 at τ=6, I need to have reached y=3 by τ=5 at least.\n\nThe earliest I can reach y=3 is at τ=3.\n\nFrom τ=3 to τ=6, I have three turns: I can be at y=3 for turns τ=3,4,5, then to y=4 at τ=6.\n\nOr at y=3 for two turns and one at lower, but that might not help.\n\nIn terms of position at τ=6, y=4.\n\nThe action at τ=5 sets y_6.\n\nIf at τ=5, y_5=3, take U, y_6=4.\n\ny_5=3 at τ=5.\n\nHow to have y_5=3.\n\ny_5=3 means at turn 5, position is 3.\n\nFrom start, I can reach y=3 at τ=3 with three U.\n\nThen from τ=3 to τ=5, I need to stay at y=3 for two turns: at τ=3 take S, y_4=3; at τ=4 take S, y_5=3; then at τ=5 take U, y_6=4.\n\nNo other way.\n\nIf I reach y=3 later, but that would add more turns, so worse.\n\nSo minimum, I need to spend two extra turns to wait at y=3 for the safe time to move to y=4.\n\nThen from y=4 at τ=6, I can go up each turn to y=9 at τ=11.\n\ny_6=4, U to y_7=5, U to y_8=6, U to y_9=7, U to y_10=8, U to y_11=9.\n\nSo τ from 0 to 11, 12 positions, y_11=9, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=10 for t=0 to 10, 11 actions, y from y_1 to y_11.\n\nSequence:\n\nτ=0: action U, set y_1=1\n\nτ=1: action U, set y_2=2\n\nτ=2: action U, set y_3=3\n\nτ=3: action S, set y_4=3\n\nτ=4: action S, set y_5=3\n\nτ=5: action U, set y_6=4\n\nτ=6: action U, set y_7=5\n\nτ=7: action U, set y_8=6\n\nτ=8: action U, set y_9=7\n\nτ=9: action U, set y_10=8\n\nτ=10: action U, set y_11=9\n\nAt τ=11, y_11=9.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt each turn, position y_τ for τ=1 to 10, and y=0 and 9 safe.\n\nτ=1: y=1, freeway 1, unsafe only at 16-19, not 1, safe\n\nτ=2: y=2, safe\n\nτ=3: y=3, safe\n\nτ=4: y=3, safe\n\nτ=5: y=3, safe\n\nτ=6: y=4, freeway 4, τ=6 not in 3,4,5,12,13,14, and 6<12, so safe\n\nτ=7: y=5, freeway 5, unsafe only τ=4, not 7, safe\n\nτ=8: y=6, unsafe only τ=4, not 8, safe\n\nτ=9: y=7, safe\n\nτ=10: y=8, safe\n\nAll safe.\n\nBut H=12, which is larger than 10.\n\nBut is there a way with H=11?\n\nH=11 would mean y_{10}=9.\n\nSo positions from τ=0 to 10, y_10=9.\n\nWith 9 U and 2 S or something, but net 9 up, so if I have D, I need more U, so best no D.\n\nWith S, I have extra stays.\n\nMinimal actions: 9 U and k S, so number of turns H = 9 + k, since each S adds a turn.\n\nWith k=0, H=10, but not possible because of collision.\n\nWith k=1, H=11, possible?\n\nIf I can have only one extra S.\n\nFor example, add one S somewhere to avoid being on y=4 at τ=4 or τ=5.\n\nBut with all U, I am on y=4 at τ=4, unsafe.\n\nIf I add a S before, say at τ=0, take S, y_1=0\n\nThen τ=1, take U, y_2=1\n\nτ=2, U, y_3=2\n\nτ=3, U, y_4=3\n\nτ=4, U, y_5=4? At τ=5, y=4, unsafe.\n\nSame.\n\nAt τ=3, take S, y_4=3\n\nThen τ=4, take U, y_5=4, at τ=5 y=4 unsafe.\n\nIf I take U at τ=4 to y_5=4, position at τ=5 is 4, unsafe.\n\nIf I could be at y=5 at τ=4, but I can't, and y=5 is unsafe at τ=4 anyway.\n\nSuppose at τ=3, I am at y=3, take U to y_4=4, but at τ=4, y=4, unsafe, collision.\n\nNot allowed.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=4 at τ=6 with only one delay.\n\nBut to be at y=4 at τ=6, I need y_6=4, so at τ=5, y_5 must be 3 to take U to 4.\n\ny_5=3.\n\nWith all U, y_5=5 if no delay, but with delays.\n\nEarliest y_5=3: if I have one S, for example at τ=2, take S instead of U.\n\nStart: τ=0, U, y_1=1\n\nτ=1, U, y_2=2\n\nτ=2, S, y_3=2  (stay at y=2)\n\nτ=3, U, y_4=3\n\nτ=4, U, y_5=4? But at τ=5, y=4, unsafe if τ=5.\n\ny_5=4 at τ=5, unsafe.\n\nIf at τ=4, I take S, y_5=3? But I want y_5=3 for later.\n\nSet y_5=3.\n\nHow: at τ=4, position y_4, take action to set y_5.\n\nIf y_4=3, take S, y_5=3.\n\ny_4=3 at τ=4.\n\nHow to have y_4=3.\n\nWith one S, for example:\n\nOption 1: delay at start.\n\nτ=0, S, y_1=0\n\nτ=1, U, y_2=1\n\nτ=2, U, y_3=2\n\nτ=3, U, y_4=3\n\nThen at τ=4, y=3, take S, y_5=3\n\nThen at τ=5, y=3, take U, y_6=4\n\nBut now y_6=4 at τ=6, safe, but I have y_5=3 at τ=5.\n\nThen from here to y=9: y_6=4, U to y_7=5, ..., up to y_10=8? y_10=8, then need to go to y=9.\n\ny_6=4, U y_7=5, U y_8=6, U y_9=7, U y_10=8, then at τ=10, y=8, take U, y_11=9\n\nAt τ=11, y_11=9, same as before, H=12.\n\nWith one S, I have y_11=9.\n\nIf I go faster at the end, but no, because from y=4 to y=9, 5 levels, 5 turns.\n\ny_6=4 to y_11=9, 5 U, yes.\n\nBut y_11=9 at τ=11.\n\nIf I can reach y=4 earlier with the S.\n\nBut I can't.\n\nAnother idea: since y=4 is safe at τ=2, but at τ=2, I can be at y=2, not y=4.\n\nFor example, if I am at y=4 at τ=2, impossible.\n\nSo I think H=12 is the minimum with one delay of two turns at y=3.\n\nBut I have two S actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have two S: one at τ=3 and one at τ=4, or wherever.\n\nBut with one S, I can't avoid the collision.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=3 at τ=3, then at τ=3, instead of staying, I take U to y_4=4, but unsafe at τ=4.\n\nOr take D to y_4=2, then at τ=4, y=2, safe, then at τ=4 take U to y_5=3, then at τ=5 take U to y_6=4, but at τ=6, y=4, safe, but I used a D, so I have extra action.\n\nPositions: y_3=3, take D, y_4=2\n\nAt τ=4, y=2, take U, y_5=3\n\nAt τ=5, y=3, take U, y_6=4\n\nThen same as before, but I have a D instead of a S, but net, from y_3=3 to y_6=4, three turns, same as with two S.\n\nAnd I ended up at y_6=4, same as before.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nThus, minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let's confirm the later unsafe times for y=1,2,3 at τ=16-19.\n\nIn this path, I am on y=1 at τ=1, y=2 at τ=2, y=3 at τ=3,4,5, all before τ=16, so no problem.\n\nThen upper levels after τ=6, all safe.\n\nSo no issue with late unsafe times.\n\nPerhaps I can go slower at the beginning to be on y=4 later, but that might not help.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 for some turns, but that adds turns without progress.\n\nSo I think H=12 is best.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach with H=11.\n\nH=11, y_{10}=9.\n\nSo positions from τ=0 to 10, y_10=9.\n\nWith 9 U and 1 S, or 10 U and 1 D, but with D, I need more U, so worse.\n\nWith 9 U and 1 S, total 10 actions, H=11 actions? Actions from τ=0 to 10, 11 actions, set y from y_1 to y_11.\n\ny_11 must be 9.\n\nWith 9 U and 2 S, for example.\n\nBut with 9 U and k S, number of actions is 9 + k, setting y from 1 to 9+k or something.\n\nStart y_0=0, after actions, y_H =9.\n\nSince each U increases y by 1, S and D keep or decrease.\n\nTo have y_H =9 from y_0=0, with H actions, let U be number of up, D down, S stay.\n\nThen y_H - y_0 = U - D =9\n\nAnd U + D + S = H\n\nAlso, since y in [0,9], no boundary issues except start and end.\n\nBut at y=0, cannot go down, etc., but in this case, with U and S only.\n\nThen U - D =9, U + D + S = H\n\nSince D=0, U=9, S = H - 9\n\nH = U + S =9 + S\n\nMinimal H when S=0, H=9, but not possible, so with S=1, H=10, but with S=1, H=10, y_{9}=9? With H=10 actions, y_{10}=9.\n\nFor example, with 9 U and 1 S.\n\nSuppose I have one S at some point.\n\nThen positions: for example, S at τ=0: y_1=0, then U to y_2=1, U to y_3=2, U to y_4=3, U to y_5=4, but at τ=5, y=4, unsafe.\n\nS at τ=1: τ=0 U, y_1=1; τ=1 S, y_2=1; τ=2 U, y_3=2; τ=3 U, y_4=3; τ=4 U, y_5=4, unsafe at τ=5.\n\nS at τ=2: τ=0 U, y_1=1; τ=1 U, y_2=2; τ=2 S, y_3=2; τ=3 U, y_4=3; τ=4 U, y_5=4, unsafe.\n\nS at τ=3: τ=0 U, y_1=1; τ=1 U, y_2=2; τ=2 U, y_3=3; τ=3 S, y_4=3; τ=4 U, y_5=4, unsafe at τ=5.\n\nS at τ=4: τ=0 U, y_1=1; τ=1 U, y_2=2; τ=2 U, y_3=3; τ=3 U, y_4=4; then at τ=4, y=4, unsafe! At τ=4 position y_4=4, which is unsafe for freeway 4 at τ=4.\n\nIf I take S at τ=4, but at τ=4, I am on y=4, collision when I take the action? No, collision is based on position at the turn, before action.\n\nAt turn τ=4, position y_4, if on freeway, check collision, then I take action.\n\nSo if y_4=4 at τ=4, it is unsafe, collision occurs, I cannot take action.\n\nSo I must not be on unsafe freeway at any turn.\n\nIn this case, with S at τ=3, I have y_4=3 at τ=4, safe, then take U, y_5=4 at τ=5, unsafe.\n\nWith S at τ=4, but if I am at y=4 at τ=4, unsafe, cannot.\n\nSo no matter where I put the S, I end up with y=4 at τ=4 or τ=5, both unsafe.\n\nThus with one S, I cannot avoid being on y=4 at unsafe time.\n\nTherefore, I need at least two S or equivalent to shift the time.\n\nThus minimal H=12 with two S.\n\nIn the sequence, I have two S actions.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nIn my first sequence: actions at τ=0 to τ=10.\n\nτ relative to t1=88.\n\nSo at turn t1 + t for t=0 to 10.\n\nActions:\n\nt=0 (τ=0): U\n\nt=1 (τ=1): U\n\nt=2 (τ=2): U\n\nt=3 (τ=3): S\n\nt=4 (τ=4): S\n\nt=5 (τ=5): U\n\nt=6 (τ=6): U\n\nt=7 (τ=7): U\n\nt=8 (τ=8): U\n\nt=9 (τ=9): U\n\nt=10 (τ=10): U\n\nThen at turn t1+10, position y=8? Let's see the position.\n\nAt turn t1+10, which is τ=10, y_10=8, but we need to reach y=9 at turn t1 + (H-1).\n\nAfter action at t1+10, y_{t1+11} = y_11 =9.\n\nSo at turn t1+11, position is 9.\n\nH-1=11, so H=12.\n\nThe last action is at t1+10, setting y_{t1+11}.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to 10, 11 actions.\n\nTo reach at turn T with y_T=9.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be the actions.\n\nBut I think I have to include up to when I set y to 9.\n\nIn the sequence above, with 11 actions, I reach at turn t1+11.\n\nBut let's write the turns.\n\nCurrent turn t1=88.\n\nI take actions at turn 88 to 98? t from 0 to 10, so turns 88 to 98.\n\nAfter action at 98, y_{99} =9.\n\nAt turn 99, position is 9.\n\nt1 + (H-1) =99, t1=88, so 88 + H-1 =99, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, for turn 88: action U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 98: U\n\nAnd position at turn 99 is 9.\n\nIn the output, it should list actions for each turn from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSo for H=12, actions from turn 88 to 99? t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1 + (H-1) =99, so actions at turns from t1 to t1+H-2? Let's clarify.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter these H actions, the position at turn t1 + H is set, but we need position at turn t1 + (H-1) to be 9? No.\n\nFrom the problem: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\n\"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1, so at turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter action at t1 + (H-1), y_{t1 + H} is set.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is the position at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nAt that turn, I take action a_{t1 + H -1}, which sets y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut for position at turn t1 + H -1, it is set by previous actions.\n\nTo have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, I don't take action at that turn in the sequence? The sequence includes actions up to when I set the position, but the position at the turn when I reach is before the last action or after.\n\nI think I have confusion.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), meaning y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\"\n\nAnd \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\"\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions from t=0 to 0, one action at t1, which sets y_{t1+1}, but we need y_{t1} or y_{t1 + H-1}?\n\ny_{t1 + H-1} =9.\n\nIf H=1, then y_{t1 + 0} = y_{t1} =9, but at t1, y=0, so not.\n\nGenerally, with actions, y at turn t1 + k depends on actions.\n\nAt turn t1, position y_{t1} =0 (given)\n\nI take action a_{t1} at turn t1, which sets y_{t1+1}\n\nThen at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}, take action a_{t1+1}, set y_{t1+2}, ..., up to take action a_{t1 + H-2} at turn t1 + H-2, set y_{t1 + H-1}\n\nThen at turn t1 + H-1, position y_{t1 + H-1}, which should be 9.\n\nThen I take action a_{t1 + H-1} at turn t1 + H-1, which sets y_{t1 + H}, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, corresponding to turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nFor turn t1 + H-1, I take action a_{t1+H-1}, but the position at that turn is y_{t1+H-1}, which is set before taking the action.\n\nAnd we need y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nThen after taking a_{t1+H-1}, y_{t1+H} is set, but we don't care about that position.\n\nIn the action at turn t1+H-1, I can take S or something, but since I am at y=9, I can take S or D, but D not possible, so S or U, but U to 10 not allowed, so probably S.\n\nBut in the sequence, for the last action, when I am at y=9, I take S to stay.\n\nBut in this case, for the reaching, y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nIn my earlier plan, with the sequence, I have y_11=9 at τ=11, which is t1+11.\n\nSo y_{t1+11} =9.\n\nSo t1 + H -1 = t1 +11, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to 11? t from 0 to H-1=11, so 12 actions.\n\nLet's list the turns.\n\nSet T = t1 + τ, so at T=88, y=0.\n\nTake action a_{88} at T=88, set y_{89}\n\nAt T=89, position y_{89}, take a_{89}, set y_{90}, etc.\n\nWe need for some T, y_T =9, and T = t1 + H -1.\n\nSo T = 88 + H -1.\n\nWith my sequence:\n\nAfter action at T=88: y_{89} =1 (if U)\n\nBetter to list positions.\n\nAssume actions:\n\nAt T=88: take U, so y_{89} =1\n\nT=89: position y_{89}=1, take U, set y_{90}=2\n\nT=90: y=2, take U, set y_{91}=3\n\nT=91: y=3, take S, set y_{92}=3\n\nT=92: y=3, take S, set y_{93}=3\n\nT=93: y=3, take U, set y_{94}=4\n\nT=94: y=4, take U, set y_{95}=5\n\nT=95: y=5, take U, set y_{96}=6\n\nT=96: y=6, take U, set y_{97}=7\n\nT=97: y=7, take U, set y_{98}=8\n\nT=98: y=8, take U, set y_{99}=9\n\nAt T=99, position y_{99}=9, which should be the reaching turn.\n\nT = t1 + H -1 =88 + H -1 =99, so 88 + H -1 =99, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions from T=88 to T=98, that is 11 actions? T=88 to 98 inclusive is 11 turns: 88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=0 to 10, 11 actions.\n\nH-1=11, so H=12.\n\nThe sequence has H actions.\n\nIn the output, for turn 88: a_{88} = U\n\nTurn 89: a_{89} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 98: a_{98} = U\n\nAnd position at turn 99 is 9.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed.\n\nBut in the car states, there is also the late unsafe times for y=1,2,3 at τ=16-19, which is t=16 to 19 relative, so turns 104 to 107, but in my path, I am long past, at τ=11, t=99, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 4, unsafe at τ=12,13,14, which is t=100 to 102, but I am at y=4 at τ=6, t=94, and upper levels, so safe.\n\nNo problem.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose I go to y=4 at τ=6, but with only one extra turn.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=4 at τ=6 without two S.\n\nBut I need to have y_6=4.\n\ny_6=4.\n\nAt τ=5, y_5 must be 3 or 4 or 5.\n\nIf y_5=3, take U to y_6=4.\n\ny_5=3.\n\nNow, to have y_5=3, with minimal turns.\n\nFrom start, with all U, y_5=5.\n\nTo have y_5=3, I need to have two less U or something.\n\nFor example, with one S and one D, but D is bad.\n\nSuppose at some point I take D.\n\nBut let's not.\n\nWith one S, y_5 could be 4 or less.\n\nFor example, if I have S at τ=0, y_1=0, then U,U,U,U, y_5=4\n\nOr S at τ=1, y_2=1, then U,U,U, y_5=4\n\nAlways y_5=4 or 5 with one S, not 3.\n\nWith no S, y_5=5.\n\nSo y_5=3 only if I have two fewer increases, like with two S or one S and one D, etc.\n\nSo not possible with less than two delays.\n\nThus H=12 is minimal.\n\nNow for the sequence.\n\nIn the output, it should be for each turn.\n\nAlso, for the upper levels, at τ=7, y=5, which is safe, etc.\n\nIn freeway 5, there is a car at τ=0 with span including 0, but at τ=7, it is far away.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, the action sequence.\n\nActions at turns:\n\nTurn 88: U  (to y=1)\n\nTurn 89: U  (to y=2)\n\nTurn 90: U  (to y=3)\n\nTurn 91: S  (stay y=3)\n\nTurn 92: S  (stay y=3)  // in my earlier, at τ=3 and τ=4, which is T=91 and T=92\n\nT=91: action S, set y_{92}=3\n\nT=92: action S, set y_{93}=3\n\nThen T=93: action U, set y_{94}=4\n\nT=94: U, set y_{95}=5\n\nT=95: U, set y_{96}=6\n\nT=96: U, set y_{97}=7\n\nT=97: U, set y_{98}=8\n\nT=98: U, set y_{99}=9\n\nAt T=99, y=9.\n\nActions from T=88 to T=98.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 88 to 98.\n\nH=11 actions? T=88 to 98 is 11 turns.\n\nt from 0 to 10, 11 actions.\n\nH= number of turns? The minimal number of turns H.\n\nIn the problem: \"the minimal number of turns H\"\n\nAnd \"a sequence of actions for t=0 to H-1\"\n\nSo H is such that after H actions, we reach at turn t1 + H -1 or something.\n\nFrom above, with 11 actions, we reach at turn 99, which is t1 + 11.\n\nt1 + (H-1) = 88 + (H-1) =99, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nThe number of turns from start to end: from turn 88 to turn 99, 12 turns, but the actions cover 11 turns.\n\nPerhaps H includes the starting turn or not.\n\nI think it's consistent.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be fine.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, at turn 98, I take U to go to y=9, but I am at y=8, take U to y=9.\n\nBut at turn 98, position is y=8, which is safe.\n\nThen set y=9.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 4, there is a car at τ=0 with head 24, tail 13, but it is moving right, so at later times, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: S\n\nTurn 92: S\n\nTurn 93: U\n\nTurn 94: U\n\nTurn 95: U\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 93: U to y=4\n\nThen up to turn 98: U to y=9.\n\nNow, the minimal H is 12, but H is the number of actions? Or the turns.\n\nIn the problem, \"the minimal number of turns H\", and from context, H is the length of the action sequence, and we reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nWith H=11 actions, reach at turn 99.\n\nBut turn 99 is t1 + 11.\n\nSince t1=88, t1 +11=99.\n\nH-1=11, so H=12.\n\nPerhaps I can think H as the number of turns from start to reach.\n\nBut in the sequence, it includes H actions.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nBut in the initial position, at (0,0), and I need to reach (0,9).\n\nAlso, in the car for freeway 5 at τ=0, there is a car at (0,-11) to (0,0)? At τ=0, freeway 5, car (0,-11,right,12), span [-11,0], so position 0 is included, but at τ=0, I am at y=0, not on freeway, so ok.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think the sequence is correct.\n\nSo H=12.\n\nBut let's see if I can do with H=11.\n\nSuppose I go to y=4 at τ=6, but with y_6=4.\n\nTo have y_6=4, and y_5=3.\n\nNow, with H=11, y_{10}=9.\n\ny_{10}=9.\n\nWith 9 U and 2 S, for example.\n\ny_{10}=9.\n\nActions from τ=0 to 9.\n\nSet y from y_1 to y_{10}.\n\ny_{10}=9.\n\nFor example, S at τ=2 and τ=3 or something.\n\nBut y_5 must be 3.\n\nSuppose:\n\nτ=0: U, y_1=1\n\nτ=1: U, y_2=2\n\nτ=2: S, y_3=2  // S at τ=2\n\nτ=3: U, y_4=3\n\nτ=4: S, y_5=3  // S at τ=4\n\nThen τ=5: U, y_6=4\n\nτ=6: U, y_7=5\n\nτ=7: U, y_8=6\n\nτ=8: U, y_9=7\n\nτ=9: U, y_{10}=8? y_9=7, U to y_{10}=8, not 9.\n\ny_{10}=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y_{10}=9, I need to be at y=8 at τ=9 or something.\n\nWith actions from τ=0 to 9, 10 actions.\n\ny_0=0, y_10 = y_0 + sum Δy = number of U minus number of D.\n\nWith U=9, S=1, D=0, then y_{10} = 0 + 9 -0 =9, but with 9 U and 1 S, 10 actions, y_{10}=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, with 10 actions, y_{10}=9.\n\nFor example:\n\nτ=0: U, y_1=1\n\nτ=1: U, y_2=2\n\nτ=2: U, y_3=3\n\nτ=3: S, y_4=3  // S at τ=3\n\nτ=4: U, y_5=4? But at τ=5, y=4 if y_5=4, unsafe.\n\ny_4=3 at τ=4, take U, y_5=4, position at τ=5 is 4, unsafe.\n\nIf I take S at τ=4, y_5=3, then at τ=5, y=3, take U, y_6=4, but then I need to go to y=9 from y=4 at τ=6.\n\ny_6=4, then U to y_7=5, ..., U to y_{10}=8, not 9.\n\nWith 10 actions, I can reach y_{10}=8 if I have one S, or y_{10}=9 with no S but not possible.\n\nWith 9 U and 1 S, 10 actions, y_{10} = start + 9 =9, since S doesn't change.\n\ny_{10} = y_0 + sum_{i=0 to 9} Δy_i\n\nΔy_i = +1 for U, 0 for S, -1 for D.\n\nSo if all U, y_{10} =10, but y=10 not allowed, so must have S or D to stop at 9.\n\nBut in this case, to have y_{10}=9, with 10 actions, I need sum Δy =9, so 9 U and 1 S, or 10 U and 1 D, etc.\n\nWith 9 U and 1 S, y_{10}=9.\n\nBut in the path, I have to be on y=4 at safe time.\n\nSuppose I have the S at a point where I can avoid.\n\nFor example, S at τ=5.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nτ=0: U, y_1=1\n\nτ=1: U, y_2=2\n\nτ=2: U, y_3=3\n\nτ=3: U, y_4=4? At τ=4, position y_4=4, unsafe!

This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by incorporating two stay actions (S) at \\(y = 3\\) to bypass the unsafe times for freeway 4 at \\(\\tau = 4\\) and \\(\\tau = 5\\) (relative to \\(t_1\\)).\n\nThe unsafe times for each freeway relative to \\(t_1 = 88\\) are:\n- Freeway 1 (y=1): unsafe at \\(\\tau = 16, 17, 18, 19\\)\n- Freeway 2 (y=2): unsafe at \\(\\tau = 16, 17, 18, 19\\)\n- Freeway 3 (y=3): unsafe at \\(\\tau = 16, 17, 18, 19\\)\n- Freeway 4 (y=4): unsafe at \\(\\tau = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\\)\n- Freeway 5 (y=5): unsafe at \\(\\tau = 4\\)\n- Freeway 6 (y=6): unsafe at \\(\\tau = 4\\)\n- Freeway 7 (y=7): unsafe at \\(\\tau = 4\\)\n- Freeway 8 (y=8): unsafe at \\(\\tau = 4\\)\n\nThe sequence ensures:\n- At \\(\\tau = 4\\) (turn 92), the player is at \\(y = 3\\), which is safe.\n- At \\(\\tau = 5\\) (turn 93), the player is at \\(y = 3\\), which is safe.\n- Freeway 4 is occupied at \\(\\tau = 6\\) (turn 94), which is safe (\\(\\tau = 6\\) not in unsafe set).\n- Upper freeways (y=5 to y=8) are occupied after \\(\\tau = 6\\), avoiding \\(\\tau = 4\\).\n\nThe action sequence for turns \\(t_1 + t\\) from \\(t = 0\\) to \\(H-1 = 11\\) (turns 88 to 98) is:\n\n- Turn 88: U (move to y=1 at turn 89)\n- Turn 89: U (move to y=2 at turn 90)\n- Turn 90: U (move to y=3 at turn 91)\n- Turn 91: S (stay at y=3 for turn 92)\n- Turn 92: S (stay at y=3 for turn 93)\n- Turn 93: U (move to y=4 at turn 94)\n- Turn 94: U (move to y=5 at turn 95)\n- Turn 95: U (move to y=6 at turn 96)\n- Turn 96: U (move to y=7 at turn 97)\n- Turn 97: U (move to y=8 at turn 98)\n- Turn 98: U (move to y=9 at turn 99)\n\nAt turn 99 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 88 + 12 - 1 = 99\\)), the position is \\((0, 9)\\).\n\n\\boxed{12}  \nTurn 88: U  \nTurn 89: U  \nTurn 90: U  \nTurn 91: S  \nTurn 92: S  \nTurn 93: U  \nTurn 94: U  \nTurn 95: U  \nTurn 96: U  \nTurn 97: U  \nTurn 98: U",

The goal is y=9.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the cars move. For each freeway, there are cars defined by their head, tail, direction, and speed. Since the cars are moving, I have to compute their positions at future turns to avoid being on the same y when x=0 is covered by a car.\n\nThe collision happens only if at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and at that exact turn, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span. Also, when I move to a new y, I'm not considered on that y until the next turn, so I don't collide if I move away before the car arrives or something. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, I am on y_T. If I choose to move up or down, at turn T, I'm still on y_T, and I move to y_{T+1} after the action. So during turn T, I'm on y_T, and I only care about cars on y_T at turn T for collision.\n\nIf I stay on the same y, then I need to avoid cars on that y at every turn I'm there.\n\nBut since I'm moving vertically, I'll be on each y for only one turn, I think, unless I stay or move back, but to minimize turns, I should go directly up.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nThe player can only move up, down, or stay, changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn.\n\nSince I start at y=0 and need to reach y=9, and y=0 to y=9, that's 9 steps up, so minimum H=9 turns if I can go up every turn without colliding.\n\nBut there might be cars blocking, so I might need to wait or detour, but detour might take more turns, so probably waiting is better if possible.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways; freeways are y=1 to 8, so I start at y=0, which has no cars, and end at y=9, no cars. Only y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nSo I need to pass through each of y=1 to 8 exactly once if I go straight up, but I might stay or move down to avoid, but that would increase H.\n\nTo minimize H, I should avoid moving down or staying unless necessary.\n\nSo let's assume I try to go up every turn. Then I would be on y=1 at turn t₁, y=2 at t₁+1, ..., up to y=9 at t₁+8. Since I start at y=0 at turn t₁, after first action U at t₁, I go to y=1 at turn t₁+1? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nI take action a_t, which determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t depends on y_t and the cars on that freeway at turn t.\n\nFor turn t, I am on freeway y_t, and I need that for no car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at turn t.\n\nNow, for my plan: at turn t₁, I am at y=0. I take action a_{t₁}, which will move me to y_{t₁+1} = 0 + Δy.\n\nBut y=0 is not a freeway, so no cars, so no collision possible at turn t₁, since I'm on y=0.\n\nThen at turn t₁+1, I am at y_{t₁+1}, which could be 0,1, or -1 but y can't be negative, min 0, so if I go down from 0, I stay at 0, I think.\n\ny ∈ [0,9], so if y_t=0 and I choose D, y_{t+1} = max(0, 0-1) =0, I think, or the equation says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so it's clipped.\n\nSimilarly for up at 9.\n\nBut here, from 0, if I go U, to y=1; if S, stay at 0; if D, stay at 0.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, if U, stay; D to 8; S stay.\n\nBut in this case, I start at y=0, and I need to reach y=9, so I should go up.\n\nNow, at turn t₁, I take action, say U, then at turn t₁+1, I am at y=1, and I need to check for collision at that turn with cars on y=1.\n\nSimilarly for each subsequent turn.\n\nThe goal is to be at y=9 at some turn, which means that at that turn, I am on y=9, and since no cars, no collision, so I just need to arrive there.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns from t₁ to t₁+H-1, so actions from t₁ to t₁+H-1, and at turn t₁+H-1, y=9.\n\nSince I start at turn t₁ at y=0, after H actions, I am at turn t₁+H.\n\nAt turn t, after action, I am at y_{t}, but the position is for that turn.\n\nLet's read:\n\n\"Player Position: (0,0) at turn t₁\"\n\nThen after action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nBut at turn t, position is (0, y_t).\n\nSo for turn t, y_t is fixed before action.\n\nAction a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t based on y_t.\n\nAt turn t₁, y_t₁ = 0, no cars, so no collision possible, regardless of action.\n\nThen I take action a_t₁, which sets y_{t₁+1}.\n\nThen at turn t₁+1, I am at y_{t₁+1}, and if y_{t₁+1} between 1 and 8, I need to check for collision at that turn with cars on that row.\n\nSimilarly for each turn.\n\nThe last turn is when y_t =9 for some t.\n\nt from t₁ to t₁ + H -1, with actions from t₁ to t₁+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, I have done H steps, from turn t₁ to t₁+H-1, and at turn t₁+H-1, y_{t₁+H-1} =9.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at t₁, to reach y=9, the minimal H without obstacles is 9, with all U actions: at t₁, U to y=1 at t₁+1; at t₁+1, U to y=2 at t₁+2; ... at t₁+8, U to y=9 at t₁+9? Let's index.\n\nAt turn t₁: y=0, take a_t₁, y_{t₁+1} = y_t₁ + Δy\n\nAfter action at t₁, at turn t₁+1, y_{t₁+1} = y_t₁ + Δy_t₁\n\nSimilarly, at turn t, y_t.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn T for some T.\n\nAt turn T, y_T =9.\n\nFrom t₁ to T, there are (T - t₁) actions taken from turn t₁ to T-1.\n\nLet T be the turn when I am at y=9.\n\nThen actions from t₁ to T-1 determine the moves.\n\nNumber of actions H = T - t₁.\n\nThen y_T =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=t₁ to t=T-1, total H actions.\n\nIn the answer, it says sequence {a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t₁} to a_{t₁+H-1}, and at turn t₁ + H -1, y=9? Let's see the notation.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t₁ + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo the sequence is actions at times t₁ to t₁+H-1, and after these H actions, at turn t₁+H-1, y=9.\n\nAt turn t₁, before action, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{t₁}, y_{t₁+1} = 0 + Δy_{t₁}\n\nThen after action a_{t₁+1}, y_{t₁+2} = y_{t₁+1} + Δy_{t₁+1}, and so on, up to after action a_{t₁+H-1}, y_{t₁+H} = y_{t₁+H-1} + Δy_{t₁+H-1}, but we have y_{t₁+H-1} =9 after the action? I'm confused.\n\nLet's clarify the state.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, player is at (0, y_t)\n\nThen player chooses action a_t, which determines Δy_t, so for the next turn, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, player is at (0, y_{t+1})\n\nCollision is checked at each turn t based on y_t and the cars on that row at time t.\n\nFor turn t, if y_t between 1 and 8, and there is a car on that row with 0 in its span at time t, collision.\n\nOtherwise, ok.\n\nThe game continues until at some turn, y_t =9.\n\nIn this setup, at turn t₁, y_t₁ =0, no collision.\n\nWe take actions from t₁ to t₁+H-1, and at turn t₁+H-1, y_{t₁+H-1} =9.\n\nSo after H actions, at turn t₁+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nSince at turn t₁, we are at y=0, to reach y=9 in H-1 steps? Let's think.\n\nAt turn t₁, position y=0.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t₁, y=0.\n\nAfter 1 action (at t₁), at turn t₁+1, y= y_0 + Δy, which could be 1 if U.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t₁+k, y_{t₁+k} = y_t₁ + sum of Δy from t₁ to t₁+k-1.\n\nWe want at turn t₁+H-1, y_{t₁+H-1} =9.\n\nSince y_t₁ =0, the net displacement must be +9, so the sum of Δy from t= t₁ to t= t₁+H-2 must be +9, because the actions from t₁ to t₁+H-2 affect y from t₁+1 to t₁+H-1.\n\nLet's set T = t₁ + H -1, the turn when we are at y=9.\n\nThen at turn T, y_T =9.\n\nActions were taken from turn t₁ to T-1, total H-1 actions? No.\n\nTurn t₁: action a_t₁, sets y_{t₁+1}\n\nTurn t₁+1: action a_{t₁+1}, sets y_{t₁+2}\n\n...\n\nTurn T-1: action a_{T-1}, sets y_T\n\nSince y_T =9, and y_t₁ =0, the actions from t₁ to T-1 determine the changes.\n\nNumber of actions: from t₁ to T-1 inclusive, that's (T-1) - t₁ +1 = T - t₁ actions.\n\nThen H = T - t₁, number of actions, and at turn t₁ + H, we are at y=9? Let's see the definition.\n\nFrom the problem: \"reach (0,9) at turn t₁ + H -1\" with actions from t=0 to H-1 for the sequence, so t from t₁ to t₁+H-1.\n\nLet t' = t - t₁, so relative turn.\n\nAt relative turn 0 (turn t₁), position y=0.\n\nAction a_{t₁+0} = a_{t₁}, sets y for relative turn 1 (turn t₁+1)\n\nAt relative turn 1, position y1, collision check if y1 in 1-8.\n\nAction a_{t₁+1}, sets y for relative turn 2.\n\n...\n\nAt relative turn k, position y_k, action a_{t₁+k}, sets y_{k+1}.\n\nWe want at some relative turn K, y_K =9.\n\nThen the number of actions taken is from relative turn 0 to K-1, so K actions, and at relative turn K, y_K=9.\n\nThe turn number is t₁ + K.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, with H=K, and y_H =9 at turn t₁+H.\n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t₁ + H -1} =9\", which is inconsistent with my notation.\n\nI think I need to use the problem's notation.\n\nProblem: \"sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"y_{t₁ + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo for t from 0 to H-1, a_{t₁ + t}, so actions at times t₁, t₁+1, ..., t₁+H-1.\n\nAfter these actions, at turn t₁ + H -1, y=9.\n\nBut at turn t₁ + H -1, before action or after?\n\nAt turn t, we have position, then we take action.\n\nAfter taking action a_t, we have y_{t+1} for next turn.\n\nBut at turn t, the position is y_t before action.\n\nFor collision at turn t, it's based on y_t.\n\nAt turn t₁ + H -1, y_{t₁ + H -1} =9, and we are at that position.\n\nTo have y_{t₁ + H -1} =9, starting from y_t₁ =0.\n\nThe actions a_{t₁} to a_{t₁+H-2} affect y from t₁+1 to t₁+H-1, and a_{t₁+H-1} affects y_{t₁+H}, but since we stop at turn t₁+H-1 with y=9, the last action a_{t₁+H-1} might not be used if we are already at 9, but we can choose S.\n\nFor example, if I am at y=9 at turn T, I can choose S to stay, but since I'm already at 9, it's done.\n\nIn this case, to reach y=9 at turn T, with T = t₁ + H -1.\n\ny_T =9.\n\nFrom y_t₁ =0, I need to increase y by 9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0, or +1.\n\nThe number of actions from t₁ to T-1 determines the change.\n\nLet T = t₁ + H -1.\n\nThen actions from turn t₁ to T-1 are a_t₁ to a_{T-1}, which set y from t₁+1 to T.\n\nSince y_T =9, and y_t₁ =0, the actions from t₁ to T-1 must sum to +9 in Δy.\n\nNumber of actions: from t₁ to T-1 inclusive, that's (T-1) - t₁ +1 = T - t₁ actions.\n\nBut T = t₁ + H -1, so T - t₁ = (t₁ + H -1) - t₁ = H -1.\n\nSo number of actions is H-1, but the sequence is for H actions from t=0 to H-1, which is H actions.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nPerhaps the sequence includes actions that set the position for the next turns, but for the last turn, when we reach y=9, we don't need to take an action if we are already there, but the sequence must be specified for H actions.\n\nLet's look at the answer format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" up to \"Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\"\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H-1, y=9.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H-1, before action, y_{t_1 + H-1} =9, and we take action a_{t_1 + H-1}, which could be S to stay, or U or D, but since y=9, U would stay, D to 8, but we are at 9, so we should choose S to stay at 9.\n\nBut the position at that turn is 9 before action.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H-1} =9, starting from y_t1 =0.\n\nThe actions a_t1 to a_{t1 + H-2} affect y from t1+1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAction a_t sets y_{t+1}.\n\nSo for y_{t1 + H-1} to be 9, it is set by action a_{t1 + H-2} at turn t1+H-2.\n\nAction at turn t sets y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to have y_T =9 for T = t1 + H-1, it is set by action a_{T-1} = a_{t1 + H-2}.\n\nThen at turn T, we are at y_T=9, and we take action a_T, which sets y_{T+1}, but since we have reached y=9 at turn T, and we include action a_T in the sequence, we can choose a_T = S to stay at 9 for the next turn, but the position at turn T is already 9, so for collision at turn T, we are on y=9, no cars, so no issue.\n\nThen the sequence has H actions, from a_t1 to a_{t1+H-1}, and after all actions, at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nWith actions from a_t1 to a_{t1+H-2} setting y from t1+1 to t1+H-1, and a_{t1+H-1} setting y_{t1+H}, but at turn t1+H-1, position is y_{t1+H-1}, which is set by a_{t1+H-2}.\n\nI think I'm making it messy.\n\nLet me define the relative turn.\n\nLet k = 0 at turn t1.\n\nAt k=0, position y=0.\n\nTake action a0, which sets y for k=1.\n\nAt k=1, position y1, check collision if y1 in 1-8.\n\nTake action a1, sets y2.\n\n...\nAt k=H-1, position y_{H-1}, and we want y_{H-1} =9.\n\nTake action a_{H-1}, which sets y_H, but we don't care about y_H.\n\nBut at turn k=H-1, we are at position y_{H-1}=9, and we take action, but the position is already 9.\n\nThe net change from k=0 to k=H-1 is +9, with each action changing y by -1,0,+1.\n\nNumber of actions is H, from a0 to a_{H-1}, but the position at k is before action a_k.\n\nAt k=0, before action, y0=0.\n\nAfter action a0, y1 = y0 + Δy0.\n\nAt k=1, position y1.\n\nAfter action a1, y2 = y1 + Δy1.\n\n...\nAt k=H-1, position y_{H-1}.\n\nAfter action a_{H-1}, y_H = y_{H-1} + Δy_{H-1}.\n\nBut we want y_{H-1} =9, not y_H.\n\nSo at step k=H-1, before taking action, we are at y_{H-1}=9.\n\nTo achieve that, with y0=0, the sum of Δy from action a0 to a_{H-2} must be +9, because a0 sets y1, a1 sets y2, ..., a_{H-2} sets y_{H-1}.\n\nThen at k=H-1, y_{H-1}=9, and we take action a_{H-1}, which can be anything, but since we are at 9, we can choose S to stay, so y_H=9, but we don't care.\n\nFor collision, at each k from 1 to H-1, if y_k in 1-8, we need no car collision.\n\nAt k=0, y0=0, no collision.\n\nActions from a0 to a_{H-2} are for moving to y_{H-1}=9, and a_{H-1} is the last action at position 9.\n\nSince we are at 9, no collision for k=H-1.\n\nFor minimal H, we probably want to reach as fast as possible, so H-1 steps to increase y by 9, so if no obstacles, H-1=9, H=10, with 9 Up actions and one Stay at the end or something.\n\nLet's calculate min possible H.\n\nIf I go up every turn, from y=0 at k=0, after 9 Up actions, at k=9, y9 =0 +9*1 =9, so at k=9, y9=9.\n\nThen I need to include action a9, which I can set to S.\n\nSo H=10 actions: a0 to a9, with a0 to a8 = U, a9=S, but at k=9, y9=9, before action, so I don't need to take action, but the sequence requires actions up to a_{H-1} with y_{H-1}=9.\n\nWith a0 to a8 = U, at k=0, y0=0, a0=U, y1=1\n\nk=1, y1=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\n...\nk=8, y8=8, a8=U, y9=9\n\nk=9, y9=9, and we take a9, which can be S, so y10=9.\n\nBut at k=9, we are at y9=9, which is the goal turn.\n\nSo for the sequence, actions from t=t1 to t1+9, with y at turn t1+9 being 9.\n\nH=10, actions from t=0 to 9 relative.\n\nBut we can have H=9 if we reach at k=8.\n\nFor example, if I start at y=0, after 8 actions, y8 could be 8 or 9, but to be at 9 at k=8, I need to increase by 9 in 8 steps, which requires some +1.125 per step, impossible, so min H is 10 with 9 Ups and one Stay or the last Up.\n\nWith 9 Ups: after 9 actions, from k=0 to k=9, y9=9.\n\nOr with 8 Ups and one something, but 8 Ups get to y8=8 at k=8, then at k=8, I am at 8, need to go to 9 at k=9 with a8=U, so at k=9, y9=9.\n\nSo either way, minimal H without obstacles is 10, with actions a0 to a8 = U, and at k=9, y9=9, a9 can be S.\n\nBut in the sequence for H=10, actions from 0 to 9.\n\nBut at k=9, we are at 9, so for collision, only k from 1 to 8 matter, since at k=0 y=0, k=9 y=9 no cars.\n\nWith obstacles, it might take more if I need to wait.\n\nBut let's first check if I can go straight up with H=10.\n\nSo I need to check for each freeway y=1 to 8, at the turn when I am on that y, whether there is a car covering x=0.\n\nSince I go up each turn, I am on y=1 at turn t1+1, y=2 at t1+2, ..., y=8 at t1+8.\n\nTurn t1+1 for y=1, t1+2 for y=2, etc., up to t1+8 for y=8.\n\nAt turn T, for freeway k, I need that for the car on k, at time T, 0 is not in the span.\n\nNow, the cars are given at time t1=92.\n\nFor each car, the span at time T is given by the movement.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nHead h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed 3.\n\nSince it's right-moving, the span at time t is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)] at time t.\n\nAt time t, span = [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)] for right-moving.\n\nIn the problem: \"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nSpan at t1 is [τ, h] for right-moving, but in the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, span at t1 is [h, τ], with h head, τ tail.\n\nIn this case, all cars here are right-moving, I think, from the data.\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nSo at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48] since right-moving.\n\nThen at time T, span = [ -59 + 3(T - t1), -48 + 3(T - t1) ]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision if 0 in [low, high] of the span at time T for the freeway.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars on a freeway, if any has 0 in span, collision.\n\nFor freeway 1, only one car.\n\nI am on freeway 1 at turn T = t1 +1, since at turn t1+1, y=1.\n\nT = t1 +1 for y=1.\n\nSimilarly, for y=k, T = t1 + k.\n\nSince I go up each turn, on y=k at turn t1 + k.\n\nFor k from 1 to 8.\n\nNow t1=92.\n\nFor freeway 1, at time T = t1 +1 = 93\n\nSpan at T: low = -59 + 3(93 - 92) = -59 + 3(1) = -59 + 3 = -56\n\nHigh = -48 + 3(1) = -45\n\nSo span [-56, -45], 0 is not in this, since -45 <0? -45 to -56, all negative, 0 > -45, so 0 not in [-56,-45], so no collision on y=1 at T=93.\n\n-56 to -45, min -56, max -45, both negative, 0 is larger, so

Good.\n\nFreeway 2: similarly, (-48, -59, right, 3) same as above.\n\nAt T for y=2, T= t1 +2 = 94\n\nSpan at T: low = -59 + 3(94-92) = -59 + 3(2) = -59 +6 = -53\n\nHigh = -48 +6 = -42\n\n[-53,-42], all negative, 0 not in, ok.\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-48,-59,right,3)\n\nAt T for y=3, T= t1+3=95\n\nLow = -59 +3(3) = -59+9= -50\n\nHigh = -48+9= -39\n\n[-50,-39], negative, ok.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4)\n\nFirst, for each car, at time T.\n\nFor y=4, T= t1+4=96\n\nFirst car: h=-48, τ=-59, right, s=4\n\nAt T=96, Δt=96-92=4\n\nSpan low = τ + s Δt = -59 +4*4 = -59+16= -43\n\nHigh = h + s Δt = -48 +16 = -32\n\nSpan [-43,-32]\n\n0 not in.\n\nSecond car: h=-12, τ=-23, right, s=4\n\nAt T=96, Δt=4\n\nLow = τ + s Δt = -23 +4*4 = -23+16= -7\n\nHigh = h + s Δt = -12 +16 =4\n\nSo span [-7,4]\n\n0 is within -7 to 4? -7 <= 0 <=4, yes, 0 is included.\n\nSo at T=96, for freeway 4, this car has span [-7,4], which includes 0.\n\nTherefore, if I am on y=4 at turn 96, I collide with this car.\n\nOh, problem.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=4 at turn 96 if I go straight up.\n\nNow, for other freeways.\n\nBut let's confirm all for y=4.\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,4) head=24, tail=13?

Let's see.\n\nAt t_rel=0, y=0.\n\nAt t_rel=t, y_t.\n\nWe want y_t =9 for some t.\n\nThe minimal t is 9 if I go up every turn: y1=1 at t=1, y2=2 at t=2, ..., y9=9 at t=9.\n\nBut with cars, I may need to be later for some y.\n\nThe time I am on y=i must be a safe time for freeway i.\n\nFor each i from 1 to 8, at time t_i, when I am on y=i, it must be safe, no collision.\n\nt_i is the turn for y=i.\n\nAnd for the sequence, t_{i} <= t_{i+1} <= t_i +1, since I can stay or move up.\n\nIf I move up, t_{i+1} = t_i +1; if I stay, t_{i+1} = t_i, but then I am on the same y multiple turns, but for freeway, if I stay, I need to be safe at each turn I am there.\n\nBut to minimize time, I should not stay unless necessary for safety.\n\nSimilarly, moving down would increase time, so not beneficial.\n\nSo assume I only move up or stay, no down.\n\nThen for each i, t_i is the time on y=i, and t_{i+1} = t_i or t_i +1.\n\nIf t_{i+1} = t_i, it means I stayed on y=i, but then at turn t_i, I was on y=i, and I stayed, so at turn t_i+1, I am still on y=i, so I am on y=i at multiple turns.\n\nBut for collision, I need to be safe at each turn I occupy the freeway.\n\nIf I stay on y=i for multiple turns, I need all those turns to be safe for that freeway.\n\nTo avoid complexity, I should try to pass each freeway in one turn, so t_{i+1} = t_i +1 for all i, except possibly when waiting.\n\nBut let's first list the safe times for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe t_rel=16,17,18,19; safe otherwise.\n\nFreeway 2: same, unsafe 16-19, safe otherwise.\n\nFreeway 3: same, unsafe 16-19, safe otherwise.\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe t_rel=3,4,5,12,13,14; safe otherwise.\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe t_rel=0,4; safe otherwise (t_rel=1,2,3,5,6,...)\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5, unsafe 0,4\n\nFreeway 7: same, unsafe 0,4\n\nFreeway 8: same, unsafe 0,4\n\nNow, for the path, I need times t1 to t8 for y=1 to 8, with t_{i+1} >= t_i and t_{i+1} <= t_i +1, and each t_i safe for freeway i.\n\nThen t9 for y=9, but y=9 no issue.\n\nStart from y=0 at t=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nt_y for y=9.\n\nSince I start at t=0 y=0, and each step I can increase y by 0 or 1, so t9 >=9.\n\nI need to choose t1 to t8.\n\nt1 must be at least 1, since from t=0 y=0, after action, at t=1, y could be 1 if I move up.\n\nt_i >= i, since I need at least i steps to reach y=i.\n\nSimilarly, t9 >=9.\n\nI want min t9.\n\nt9 = t8 + something, but not necessarily.\n\nThe time to go from y=0 to y=9 is at least 9 turns.\n\nWith t_i for y=i.\n\nThe difference t_{i} - t_{i-1} is 0 or 1, since I move up or stay.\n\nIf I move up, t_i = t_{i-1} +1; if I stay, t_i = t_{i-1}, but then y doesn't increase.\n\nDefine s_i as the time when I first reach y=i or something.\n\nSet t0 =0, y=0.\n\nThen for each step, I choose action, but for planning, set the times.\n\nLet t_i be the turn when I am at y=i for the first time or when I pass it.\n\nSince I may stay, but to min time, I should not stay unless must.\n\nAssume I pass each y at a specific time.\n\nThen t1, t2, ..., t8 must be safe for resp. freeway.\n\nAnd t_{i} <= t_{i+1} <= t_i +1 for i=1 to7? For y from 1 to 8.\n\ny=1 to 8.\n\nt1 for y=1, t2 for y=2, etc.\n\nt_{i+1} >= t_i and t_{i+1} <= t_i +1.\n\nIf t_{i+1} = t_i, it means I am at y=i and y=i+1 at same turn? No, at a given turn, I am at one y.\n\nIf at turn t, I am at y=i, then after action, at t+1, I am at y=i+1 if I move up.\n\nSo the times t_i are distinct unless I stay, but if I stay, at turn t, y=i, then at turn t+1, if I stay, y=i, so t_i is not unique.\n\nTo simplify, let T_i be the turn when I am on y=i, and since I may be on multiple turns, but for min time, I can assume I pass each y at one turn, by not staying if not necessary.\n\nBut for some freeways, I may need to wait, i.e., stay on a safe y until the target freeway is safe.\n\nBut since y=0 and y=9 are safe, I can stay there.\n\nIn this case, y=0 is safe, no cars.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nFreeways 1-8 may require waiting.\n\nTo min t9, I should start moving as soon as possible.\n\nLet's find the earliest possible t_i for each.\n\nBut constrained by the safety.\n\nAlso, the relative times.\n\nFirst, for freeway 5,6,7,8, they are unsafe at t_rel=0 and 4.\n\nt_rel=0 is turn t1=92, but t_rel is relative to t1=92, so t_rel=0 is turn 92.\n\nBut at turn 92, I am at y=0, not on freeway, so for freeway 5, unsafe at t_rel=0 means that if I am on y=5 at turn 92, I collide, but I am not, so for the time when I am on y=5, I need to avoid t_rel=0 and t_rel=4.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nt_rel=4 is turn 96.\n\nNow, for freeway 4, unsafe at 3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nt_rel=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nNow, I need to choose t_i for i=1 to 8.\n\nt1 >=1, t2>=2, ..., t8>=8.\n\nt8 <= t9, etc.\n\nMin t9 = t8 +1 if I move up, or t8 if I stay, but to reach 9, I need to move up from 8.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, I can go directly.\n\nNow, let's list the constraints for each t_i.\n\nFor y=1, t1 must be safe for freeway 1, i.e., not in {16,17,18,19}, so t1 <=15 or t1 >=20.\n\nBut t1 >=1, so t1=1 to 15 or 20+.\n\nSimilarly for y=2, t2 not in {16,17,18,19}, so t2<=15 or t2>=20.\n\ny=3, t3 not in {16,17,18,19}, t3<=15 or t3>=20.\n\ny=4, t4 not in {3,4,5,12,13,14}, so t4 <=2 or t4=6,7,8,9,10,11 or t4>=15.\n\ny=5, t5 not in {0,4}, but t5 >=5 since t1>=1, t5>=5, so t5 !=4, and t5!=0, so safe as long as t5 !=4, since t5>=5>0.\n\nt5 not 0 or 4, but t5 >=5, so t5 !=0, and t5 !=4, so for t5>=5, only need t5 !=4, so t5 can be 5,6,7,... except 4, but 4<5, so all t5>=5 are safe except possibly, but t5>=5, so t5=5,6,7,... all fine, since only t_rel=0 and 4 unsafe, t_rel=0 not possible for t5>=5, t_rel=4 is turn 96, t5 could be 4? t_rel=4, but t5 is the time for y=5, t5 >=5, so t_rel for t5 is at least 5>4, so t5 !=4, and t5 !=0, so for y=5, any t5 >=5 is safe, because unsafe only at 0 and 4, which are before or at 4, but t5>=5.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8, same thing, any t_i >=i >=6>4, so no issue, all times safe for i=5,6,7,8.\n\ny=5, t5>=5, unsafe only at t_rel=0 and 4, both less than 5, so for t5>=5, always safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=6, t6>=6>4, safe always.\n\ny=7, t7>=7>4, safe.\n\ny=8, t8>=8>4, safe.\n\nSo only freeways 1,2,3,4 have restrictions, and y=5-8 are always safe when occupied, since t_i >=i >=5>4.\n\nNow for y=4, t4 must be safe: not in {3,4,5,12,13,14}, and t4 >=4.\n\nt4 >=4, so cannot be <=2, so t4 must be in {6,7,8,9,10,11} or >=15.\n\nThat is, t4 =6,7,8,9,10,11 or t4>=15.\n\nSimilarly for y=1,2,3: t1 not in {16,17,18,19}, so t1=1 to 15 or >=20\n\nBut since t1>=1, and t4 <= t1 + something, but let's sequence.\n\nI need to choose t1,t2,t3,t4 with t1<=t2<=t3<=t4 and t2<=t1+1, t3<=t2+1, t4<=t3+1, since I move up or stay, but if I stay, t_i same, but let's assume no stay for min time, so t_{i} = t_{i-1} +1 for i=1 to4, but from y=0 to y=1, t1 = t0 +1 =1, since at t=0 y=0, after action up, at t=1 y=1.\n\nSimilarly, if always up, t_i = i for i=1 to8.\n\nBut t4 must be in {6,7,8,9,10,11} or >=15.\n\nIf I go straight, t4=4, but 4 is unsafe for y=4, since t_rel=4 is in {3,4,5}, unsafe.\n\nSo I need to delay or advance t4.\n\nt4 must be at least 4, but 4 unsafe, 5 unsafe (t_rel=5 in unsafe set), 6 safe.\n\nSo earliest possible t4 is 6.\n\nSimilarly, t1,t2,t3 need to be safe.\n\nt1 must be <=15 or >=20, but since t4=6, and t1 <= t4 -3? t1 <= t4 - (4-1) = t4 -3 if no stay.\n\nSince t_{i} = t_{i-1} +1, so t4 = t1 +3.\n\nIf t4=6, then t1=3, t2=4, t3=5, t4=6.\n\nNow check safety.\n\nt1=3: for y=1, freeway 1, safe if not 16-19, 3<16, so safe.\n\nt2=4: y=2, freeway 2, safe if not 16-19, 4<16, safe.\n\nt3=5: y=3, freeway 3, safe if not 16-19, 5<16, safe.\n\nt4=6: y=4, freeway 4, safe since 6 in {6,7,8,9,10,11}, yes.\n\nThen y=5 to 8, no issue, t5=7, t6=8, t7=9, t8=10, all safe.\n\nThen to reach y=9, at t=11, I can be at y=9 if I go up from y=8 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, y=8, action U, to y=9 at t=11.\n\nSo at turn t_rel=11, y=9.\n\nt_rel=11 from start.\n\nNow, total turns: from t_rel=0 to t_rel=11, so at turn t1 + 11, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t_rel=0 to t_rel=10? Actions at turns.\n\nAt turn t_rel=0: action, sets y for t=1\n\nAt t=0, position y=0, take action a0, set y1.\n\nAt t=1, position y1, take action a1, set y2, etc.\n\nIn this case, with t_i = i for i=1 to8, but t4=4 unsafe, so we set t1=3, t2=4, t3=5, t4=6.\n\nt1=3 means at turn 3, we are on y=1.\n\nHow to achieve that.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nTo be at y=1 at t=3, I need to stay at y=0 for 2 turns or something.\n\nAt t=0, y=0, I can choose S to stay at y=0 for t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, y=0, choose S again, stay at y=0 for t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, y=0, choose U, to y=1 at t=3.\n\nThen at t=3, y=1, choose U, to y=2 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, y=2, choose U, to y=3 at t=5.\n\nAt t=5, y=3, choose U, to y=4 at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, y=4, choose U, to y=5 at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, y=5, choose U, to y=6 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, y=6, choose U, to y=7 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=7, choose U, to y=8 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, y=8, choose U, to y=9 at t=11.\n\nAt t=11, y=9, which is the goal, and we take action at t=11, but since we are at y=9, we can choose S or U, but U would stay, so S to stay.\n\nIn the sequence, we need actions up to the turn when we reach y=9.\n\nAt turn t=11, we are at y=9, so we need to include action at t=11.\n\nNow, with this, at t=3, y=1, freeway 1: t_rel=3, which is not 16-19, so safe.\n\nAt t=4, y=2, freeway 2, t_rel=4, not 16-19, safe.\n\nAt t=5, y=3, freeway 3, t_rel=5, not 16-19, safe.\n\nAt t=6, y=4, freeway 4, t_rel=6, which is safe, as 6 not in {3,4,5,12,13,14}.\n\nThen y=5 at t=7, freeway 5: t_rel=7, which is not 0 or 4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nNow, is this minimal? t=11 to reach y=9.\n\nBut earlier I thought min is 9, but with delay, it took 11.\n\nCan I do better?\n\nt4 must be at least 6, since 4 and 5 unsafe.\n\nt1 must be at least 1, but in this case we started moving later.\n\nCould I have t4=6 with t1 smaller?\n\nFor example, if I go up immediately to y=1 at t=1.\n\nBut then t1=1, t2=2, t3=3, t4=4.\n\nBut t4=4 is unsafe for y=4.\n\nt3=3: at t=3, y=3, which is freeway 3, t_rel=3, not unsafe (unsafe 16-19), so safe.\n\nBut t4=4 unsafe.\n\nI could stay at y=3 for one turn to avoid t4=4.\n\nFor example: at t=3, y=3, choose S, stay at y=3 for t=4.\n\nThen at t=4, y=3, choose U, to y=4 at t=5.\n\nBut t=5, y=4, t_rel=5, which is unsafe for y=4, since 5 in {3,4,5}.\n\nThen I need to go later.\n\nt=5 unsafe, so I need to be on y=4 at different time.\n\nWith t4=6 as before.\n\nAnother option: since y=4 can be safe at t=6 to 11 or >=15.\n\nt=6 is the earliest.\n\nBut t=6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nWith t1=1, t2=2, t3=3, then I need t4=6, but t4 must be <= t3 +1 =4, but 6>4, impossible to have t4=6 if t3=3, since t4 <= t3 +1=4.\n\nIf t3=3, t4 <=4.\n\nBut t4=4 unsafe, t4=5 also unsafe, so I cannot be on y=4 at t=4 or 5.\n\nt4 must be at least 4, but 4 and 5 unsafe, so earliest possible t4 is 6.\n\nBut to have t4=6, I need t3 <=6 and t3 >=5, since t4 <= t3 +1 and t4 >= t3.\n\nIf t4=6, then t3 must be 5 or 6.\n\nIf t3=5, t4=6; or t3=6, t4=6 but same turn? Not possible, different y.\n\nt3 and t4 different turns.\n\nSo if t4=6, t3 must be 5, since t4 <= t3 +1 and t4 >= t3, so t3=5, t4=6.\n\nSimilarly, t2 must be such that t3=5, so t2=4 or 5, but t3 <= t2 +1, t3=5.\n\nIf t2=4, t3=5; or t2=5, t3=5 not possible, so t2=4, t3=5.\n\nSimilarly, t1=3 or 4, but t2=4, so t1=3 or 4.\n\nIf t1=3, t2=4; or t1=4, t2=4 not possible, so t1=3, t2=4, t3=5, t4=6 as before.\n\nThus, the earliest t4 is 6, with t1=3, t2=4, t3=5.\n\nThen t5=7, t6=8, t7=9, t8=10, t9=11.\n\nt9 is y=9 at t=11.\n\nIf I can reach y=9 earlier? But t4=6, so y=4 at t=6, then y=5 at 7, etc., up to y=9 at 11, so 11 is minimal.\n\nBut y=5 to 8 no delay, so yes.\n\nNow, but we have freeways 1,2,3 with unsafe at 16-19, but since we are at t=3,4,5 which are early, safe.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we start at t_rel=0, y=0.\n\nActions:\n\nAt t=0: since we need to stay until t=2, then move.\n\nAt t=0: choose S, so y1=0 (at t=1)\n\nAt t=1: position y=0, choose S, so y2=0 (at t=2)\n\nAt t=2: position y=0, choose U, so y3=1 (at t=3)\n\nAt t=3: position y=1, choose U, so y4=2 (at t=4)\n\nAt t=4: position y=2, choose U, so y5=3 (at t=5)\n\nAt t=5: position y=3, choose U, so y6=4 (at t=6)\n\nAt t=6: position y=4, choose U, so y7=5 (at t=7)\n\nAt t=7: position y=5, choose U, so y8=6 (at t=8)\n\nAt t=8: position y=6, choose U, so y9=7 (at t=9)\n\nAt t=9: position y=7, choose U, so y10=8 (at t=10)\n\nAt t=10: position y=8, choose U, so y11=9 (at t=11)\n\nAt t=11: position y=9, which is the goal.\n\nNow, we need to take action at t=11, which can be S, to stay at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to t=10 for the moves to reach y=9 at t=11, but action at t=10 sets y11=9, so at turn t=11, we are at y=9.\n\nThen we take action at t=11, but since we are done, we can choose S.\n\nThe sequence includes actions up to when we reach y=9 at that turn.\n\nIn this case, at turn t=11, we are at y=9, so we need action at t=11.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t=t1 to t=t1 + H -1, with y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nHere, at turn t1 + 11, y=9, so H-1=11, H=12? Let's see.\n\nt_rel=0 to 11, 12 turns.\n\nActions from t_rel=0 to 11, 12 actions.\n\ny at turn k is set by previous action.\n\nAt turn k, position y_k.\n\nAfter action a_k, y_{k+1} = y_k + Δy_k.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet t_rel = k.\n\nAt k=0, y=0\n\nAfter a0, y1\n\nAt k=1, y1\n\nAfter a1, y2\n\n...\n\nAt k=M, y_M=9 for some M.\n\nThen H-1 = M, so M = H-1.\n\nThus y_{H-1} =9 at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, y_M=9 with M=11.\n\nSo H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions from k=0 to 11.\n\nWith k from 0 to 11, 12 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, for k=0 to 10: actions to reach y=9 at k=11.\n\nAt k=11, y=9, and we take a11=S.\n\nIn the action sequence: a0=S (stay at 0), a1=S (stay), a2=U (to 1), a3=U (to 2), a4=U (to 3), a5=U (to 4), a6=U (to 5), a7=U (to 6), a8=U (to 7), a9=U (to 8), a10=U (to 9), a11=S (stay at 9).\n\nAfter a10=U, at k=11, y=9.\n\nThen at k=11, we take a11=S.\n\nBut we are already at y=9 at turn k=11.\n\nNow, H=12, since actions from t=0 to 11.\n\nBut can we reduce H?\n\nFor example, if I can reach earlier.\n\nBut t4=6 is minimal, so y=4 at t=6, then y=5 at 7, ..., y=9 at 11, so t=11 for y=9.\n\nIf I go faster to higher y, but since I have to pass lower y, and y=4 must be at least 6, I think 11 is minimal.\n\nAnother point: at the beginning, I stayed two turns at y=0, but y=0 is safe, no issue.\n\nFreeway 5 to 8 are safe after t_rel=5, but since we pass them after, no problem.\n\nNow, but we need to confirm for all.\n\nIn the sequence, at k=3: y=1, t_rel=3, freeway 1: unsafe only at 16-19, 3<16, safe.\n\nk=4: y=2, t_rel=4, freeway 2, safe.\n\nk=5: y=3, t_rel=5, freeway 3, safe.\n\nk=6: y=4, t_rel=6, freeway 4: unsafe at 3,4,5,12,13,14; 6 not in, safe.\n\nk=7: y=5, t_rel=7, freeway 5: unsafe at 0,4; 7 not, safe.\n\nSimilarly, k=8: y=6, safe.\n\nk=9: y=7, safe.\n\nk=10: y=8, safe.\n\nk=11: y=9, no car.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, the actions: from turn t1=92.\n\nSo actions at turn 92 to turn 92 + 11 = 103.\n\nt1=92.\n\nAction at t: for t from 92 to 103? Let's list.\n\nTurn t1: action a_{t1} = S (since at turn 92, position y=0, choose S)\n\nTurn t1+1: 93, position y=0 (since stayed), choose S\n\nTurn t1+2: 94, position y=0, choose U\n\nTurn t1+3: 95, position y=1, choose U\n\nTurn t1+4: 96, position y=2, choose U\n\nAt turn t1+3=95, position y=1, after choosing U at t=94? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, choose action a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn 92 (t1), position y=0, choose a_{92} = S, so y_{93} = 0 + 0 =0\n\nAt turn 93, position y=0 (since y93=0), choose a_{93} = S, so y_{94} =0\n\nAt turn 94, position y=0, choose a_{94} = U, so y_{95} =0 +1=1\n\nAt turn 95, position y=1, choose a_{95} = U, so y_{96} =1+1=2\n\nAt turn 96, position y=2, choose a_{96} = U, so y_{97} =2+1=3\n\nAt turn 97, position y=3, choose a_{97} = U, so y_{98} =3+1=4\n\nAt turn 98, position y=4, choose a_{98} = U, so y_{99} =4+1=5\n\nAt turn 99, position y=5, choose a_{99} = U, so y_{100} =5+1=6\n\nAt turn 100, position y=6, choose a_{100} = U, so y_{101} =6+1=7\n\nAt turn 101, position y=7, choose a_{101} = U, so y_{102} =7+1=8\n\nAt turn 102, position y=8, choose a_{102} = U, so y_{103} =8+1=9\n\nAt turn 103, position y=9, choose a_{103} = S (or any, but S to stay)\n\nNow, at which turn is y=9? At turn 103.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =103\n\nt1=92, so 92 + H -1 =103, thus 91 + H =103, H=12.\n\nActions from t=92 to 103, 12 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we have:\n\nTurn 92: S\n\nTurn 93: S\n\nTurn 94: U\n\nTurn 95: U\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nTurn 100: U\n\nTurn 101: U\n\nTurn 102: U\n\nTurn 103: S\n\nBut at turn 103, we are at y=9, and we choose S.\n\nThe minimal H is 12.\n\nBut earlier I thought H=10 without obstacles, but with obstacles, 12.\n\nCan we do with H=11?\n\nThat would require reaching y=9 at turn t1 + H -1 =92 +10 =102 if H=11, so at turn 102, y=9.\n\nBut from start, to reach y=9 at turn 102, we need net +9 in changes.\n\nThe time from turn 92 to turn 102 is 10 turns, actions from 92 to 101 set y from 93 to 102.\n\ny at turn 102 must be 9.\n\ny_{102} = y_{92} + sum of Δy from t=92 to 101.\n\ny_{92}=0, so sum Δy from 92 to 101 must be 9.\n\nNumber of actions: 10 actions (t=92 to 101), each Δy = -1,0,1, sum to 9, so must be all +1, no stay or down.\n\nThus, with all U actions, y_{93}=1, y_{94}=2, ..., y_{102}=9.\n\nBut then at turn 96, y=4? Let's see:\n\nTurn 92: y=0, action U, y93=1\n\nTurn 93: y=1, action U, y94=2\n\nTurn 94: y=2, action U, y95=3\n\nTurn 95: y=3, action U, y96=4\n\nTurn 96: y=4, but t_rel=96-92=4, freeway 4 unsafe, as we saw.\n\nSimilarly, turn 97: y=5, t_rel=5, freeway 5: unsafe at t_rel=4? t_rel=5, freeway 5 unsafe only at 0 and 4, 5>4, safe.\n\nBut y=4 at t=96, t_rel=4, unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf I have some stay, but with 10 actions to sum to 9, I must have 9 Ups and one Stay, but the Stay would be at some y, so I reach later.\n\nFor example, if I stay once, then with 10 actions, sum Δy=9, so 9 Ups and one Stay, say at some point.\n\nBut then y_{102} = y_{92} + sum =0 +9 =9, but the time to reach is later.\n\nFor instance, if I stay at y=0 for one turn, then I go up.\n\nBut at turn 102, y=9 only if I started later.\n\nSuppose actions:\n\nt=92: S, y93=0\n\nt=93: U, y94=1\n\nt=94: U, y95=2\n\nt=95: U, y96=3\n\nt=96: U, y97=4\n\nBut at t=96, y=3? t=96 position y96=3 (from action at t=95), then action U, y97=4.\n\nBut at turn t=96, position y=3, which is freeway 3, t_rel=4, unsafe? t_rel=96-92=4.\n\nFreeway 3 unsafe at t_rel=16-19, 4<16, safe.\n\nThen at t=96, position y=3, choose U, so y97=4.\n\nAt turn t=97, position y=4, t_rel=5, which is unsafe for y=4, since t_rel=5 in {3,4,5}.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf I stay at y=3 at some point.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at turn 102.\n\nWith 10 actions, if I have a stay, say at t=95: position y=3, choose S, so y96=3\n\nThen t=96: position y=3, choose U, y97=4\n\nt=97: position y=4, t_rel=97-92=5, unsafe for y=4.\n\nStill.\n\nIf I stay earlier.\n\nSuppose t=92: U, y93=1\n\nt=93: U, y94=2\n\nt=94: S, y95=2? At t=94, position y=2, choose S, so y95=2\n\nThen t=95: position y=2, choose U, y96=3\n\nt=96: position y=3, choose U, y97=4\n\nAt t=97: position y=4, t_rel=5, unsafe.\n\nSame.\n\nTo avoid y=4 at t=4,5, I need to be at y=4 at t=6 or later.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at t=102, with t=102, y=9, that means I must have been at y=8 at t=101 or earlier, but since all up, at t=101 y=8, t=102 y=9.\n\nt=101: position y=8, t_rel=9.\n\nBut y=4 must be at some turn, say t=97 if all up, but t=97 t_rel=5, unsafe if y=4.\n\nThe turn for y=4 must be between min and max, but with fixed path, it is fixed if no stay.\n\nWith stay, I can shift.\n\nBut to have y=4 at t=6, for example, I need to start later or stay.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at t=102, I must have y=4 at t=97 if no stay, but t=97 t_rel=5 unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at some point before, I delay all.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 for one turn: t=92: S, y93=0\n\nt=93: U, y94=1\n\nt=94: U, y95=2\n\nt=95: U, y96=3\n\nt=96: U, y97=4  // t_rel=5, unsafe\n\nStill.\n\nIf stay twice: t=92: S, y93=0\n\nt=93: S, y94=0\n\nt=94: U, y95=1\n\nt=95: U, y96=2\n\nt=96: U, y97=3\n\nt=97: U, y98=4  // t_rel=6, safe\n\nThen continue: t=97: position y=3, U, y98=4\n\nt=98: position y=4, U, y99=5\n\n...\n\nBut to reach y=9 at t=102: y99=5, y100=6, y101=7, y102=8, not 9.\n\nWith actions to t=101: y at t=102 set by a101.\n\nIf I go all up from here: t=98: position y=4, U, y99=5\n\nt=99: y=5, U, y100=6\n\nt=100: y=6, U, y101=7\n\nt=101: y=7, U, y102=8\n\ny102=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=102, I need y102=9, which requires that at t=101, position y=8, and U, or something.\n\nBut with the stay, I am behind.\n\nIn this case, at t=102, y=8 if I go up.\n\nTo reach y=9 earlier, I need fewer stays, but I have to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nThus, with H=11, I cannot reach y=9 at turn 102 without collision, because y=4 would be at t=96 or 97 with t_rel=4 or 5, unsafe.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 12, with the sequence as above.\n\nNow, back to the answer.\n\nH=12\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 92: S\n\nTurn 93: S\n\nTurn 94: U\n\nTurn 95: U\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nTurn 100: U\n\nTurn 101: U\n\nTurn 102: U\n\nTurn 103: S\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 103, we have action S, but at that turn we are at y=9.\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nBut let's write relative to t1.\n\nt1=92.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t1: S\n\nTurn t1+1: S\n\nTurn t1+2: U\n\nTurn t1+3: U\n\nTurn t1+4: U\n\nTurn t1+5: U\n\nTurn t1+6: U\n\nTurn t1+7: U\n\nTurn t1+8: U\n\nTurn t1+9: U\n\nTurn t1+10: U\n\nTurn t1+11: S\n\nH=12, actions from t=0 to 11 relative.\n\nIn the sequence, t from t1 to t1+11.\n\ny at turn t1+11 is 9.\n\nIn the car state, freeway 5 has a car (0,-11,right,12) which at t_rel=0, span includes 0, but we are not on freeway at t_rel=0.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nI think this is correct.\n\nBut in the beginning, I stayed two turns at y=0, but since no cars, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=1 earlier and stay there or something, but y=1 at t=1 might be ok, but then I need to delay reaching y=4.\n\nFor example, at t=92: U, to y=1 at t=93\n\nThen at t=93: S, stay at y=1 for t=94? At t=93, position y=1, choose S, so y94=1\n\nThen t=94: position y=1, choose S, y95=1? But I need to go up.\n\nTo reach y=4 later.\n\nBut with t1=1 for y=1 at t=93.\n\nThen if I stay at y=1 for two turns: t=93: S, y94=1\n\nt=94: S, y95=1\n\nThen t=95: U, to y=2 at t=96\n\nt=96: U, to y=3 at t=97\n\nt=97: U, to y=4 at t=98\n\nThen same as before, t=98 y=4, t_rel=6, safe.\n\nBut then to reach y=9: t=98 y=4, U to y=5 t=99, U to y=6 t=100, U to y=7 t=101, U to y=8 t=102, U to y=9 t=103.\n\nSame as before, reach at t=103.\n\nIf I stay less, but I cannot avoid the delay for y=4.\n\nThus, minimal H=12.\n\nSo the sequence should be as above.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 92\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 12. This sequence involves staying at \\(y = 0\\) for the first two turns to delay the arrival at \\(y = 4\\) until turn 98 (relative turn 6), when it is safe, and then moving up one row per turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 103 (relative turn 11).\n\nThe car states at \\(t_1 = 92\\) and their movement rules dictate that:\n- Freeway 4 is unsafe at relative turns 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, and 14 due to car spans covering \\(x = 0\\).\n- To avoid collision on freeway 4, the player must be on \\(y = 4\\) at a safe relative turn, such as 6 (turn 98).\n- This requires starting the ascent later, with two \"Stay\" (S) actions at \\(y = 0\\) (turns 92 and 93).\n- After moving up, all other freeways are safe at the times the player occupies them, as verified below.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t}\\}_{t=92}^{103}\\) is:\n\n- Turn 92: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\))  \n- Turn 93: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\))  \n- Turn 94: U (move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 95)  \n- Turn 95: U (move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 96)  \n- Turn 96: U (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 97)  \n- Turn 97: U (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 98)  \n- Turn 98: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 99)  \n- Turn 99: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 100)  \n- Turn 100: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 101)  \n- Turn 101: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 102)  \n- Turn 102: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 103)  \n- Turn 103: S (stay at \\(y = 9\\), as the goal is reached)\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification\n- **Turn 95 (\\(y = 1\\), relative turn 3)**: Freeway 1 car span at relative turn 3 is \\([-59 + 3 \\times 3, -48 + 3 \\times 3] = [-50, -39]\\), which does not contain 0. Safe.\n- **Turn 96 (\\(y = 2\\), relative turn 4)**: Freeway 2 car span at relative turn 4 is \\([-59 + 3 \\times 4, -48 + 3 \\times 4] = [-47, -36]\\), which does not contain 0. Safe.\n- **Turn 97 (\\(y = 3\\), relative turn 5)**: Freeway 3 car span at relative turn 5 is \\([-59 + 3 \\times 5, -48 + 3 \\times 5] = [-44, -33]\\), which does not contain 0. Safe.\n- **Turn 98 (\\(y = 4\\), relative turn 6)**: Freeway 4 cars:\n  - Car 1: span \\([-59 + 4 \\times 6, -48 + 4 \\times 6] = [-35, -24]\\), no 0.\n  - Car 2: span \\([-23 + 4 \\times 6, -12 + 4 \\times 6] = [1, 12]\\), no 0.\n  - Car 3: span \\([13 + 4 \\times 6, 24 + 4 \\times 6] = [37, 48]\\), no 0.\n  Safe (relative turn 6 not in unsafe set {3,4,5,12,13,14}).\n- **Turn 99 (\\(y = 5\\), relative turn 7)**: Freeway 5 unsafe only at relative turns 0 and 4. Relative turn 7 > 4, so safe (spans do not contain 0).\n- **Turn 100 (\\(y = 6\\), relative turn 8)**: Freeway 6 unsafe only at relative turns 0 and 4. Relative turn 8 > 4, so safe.\n- **Turn 101 (\\(y = 7\\), relative turn 9)**: Freeway 7 unsafe only at relative turns 0 and 4. Relative turn 9 > 4, so safe.\n- **Turn 102 (\\(y = 8\\), relative turn 10)**: Freeway 8 unsafe only at relative turns 0 and 4. Relative turn 10 > 4, so safe.\n- **Turn 103 (\\(y = 9\\))**: No cars, safe.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in minimal \\(H = 12\\) turns, with \\(y = 9\\) reached at turn 103.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 92: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 93: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 94: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 95: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 96: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 97: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 98: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 99: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 100: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 101: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 102: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 103: \\text{ S} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get from position (0,0) at turn t1=96 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and there's a car on that freeway where 0 is in its span at that turn. The car spans move based on their direction and speed. Left-moving cars decrease their position, right-moving increase.\n\nThe car states are given for turn t1=96. I need to find where the cars will be at future turns relative to t1.\n\nLet me denote the time difference: let τ = T - t1, so τ is the number of turns after t1.\n\nFor each car, the span at time T = t1 + τ is:\n\n- If direction is right: span = [τ + s * τ, h + s * τ] but wait, no.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s * (T - t1), τ - s * (T - t1)] but it says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\", and for left-moving, it's [h, τ] → [h - s * Δt, τ - s * Δt] where Δt = T - t1.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + s * Δt, h + s * Δt]? Let's read carefully.\n\nIt says: for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\n\nBut h and τ are positions at t1, so for left-moving, since it's moving left, positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for left-moving, head and tail might be defined differently? I think I need to interpret the head and tail based on direction.\n\nIn the car state table, it's listed as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nBut for movement, when direction is right, head is the front, so as it moves right, both increase.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving, head is front, so as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nIn the update rule:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]? No.\n\nLet's read exactly:\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nSo for left-moving, at t1, positions from h to τ, with h and τ, but since it's moving left, and h is head, I assume h > τ or something? Positions are on a line, so we need to know the min and max.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nIn right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], which might imply τ is left end, h is right end, so [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], but if it's [h, τ], and moving left, if h is head, it might be that h > τ, so [τ, h] would be better, but it's written as [h, τ] for left.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I should think in terms of the left and right ends of the car span.\n\nFor each car, at time t1, we have a span [min, max], and direction.\n\nThen at time T, the span shifts.\n\nFor left-moving car: the entire span moves left by s per turn, so min decreases, max decreases.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: min increases, max increases.\n\nIn the given data, for each car, the head and tail are given, and we need to interpret which is min and max based on direction.\n\nFor example, for a left-moving car, if head is at h and tail at τ, and it's moving left, so head is the front, so at t1, position of head is h, tail is τ, with h > τ since head is ahead when moving left? Let's think.\n\nSuppose the car is moving left. The head is the front, so if it's moving left, the head has higher x-value, and tail has lower, so min x is tail, max x is head.\n\nBut in the span, it's given as [h, τ] for left-moving. If h is head and moving left, h should be the rightmost point? I'm getting confused.\n\nPerhaps it's better to look at the values given.\n\nFor instance, in freeway 4, there is a car (-48, -59, right, 4). Direction right, so for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the notation: (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor direction right: head is right end, tail is left end, so span is [tail, head] = [τ, h]\n\nSimilarly, for direction left: head is left end? But in the update for left, it says Span(t1) = [h, τ], which might be [head, tail], but if moving left, head should be the front, so if moving left, head has higher x, tail has lower x, so span [tail, head] = [min, max].\n\nBut in the update, for left-moving, it says [h, τ] → [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt], so if h is head and higher, τ tail lower, then [h, τ] with h > τ, so after moving left, both decrease, so min decreases, max decreases, which is correct for moving left.\n\nFor example, if at t1, left-moving car, h = 10, τ = 5, span [10,5]? [10,5] doesn't make sense if 10>5, it should be [5,10] for positions.\n\nI think there's a inconsistency in the interval notation.\n\nIn mathematics, [a,b] usually assumes a <= b.\n\nBut here, for left-moving, it says [h, τ], and if h and τ are such that h > τ, then [h, τ] would imply from high to low, but typically we write min to max.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I should think of the car span as the set of positions it occupies, and for collision, we care if 0 is in [min, max] at time T for the freeway we're on.\n\nFor a given car, at t1, we have head and tail positions, and direction.\n\n- For right-moving: head is the right end, tail is the left end, so min position = tail, max position = head.\n\nAt time T, min_T = tail + s * (T - t1)\n\nmax_T = head + s * (T - t1)\n\nBecause it moves right, both increase.\n\n- For left-moving: head is the left end? But in the update, it says for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] and moves to [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]\n\nIf the car is moving left, the head should be the front, so if moving left, the head has higher x-value, and as it moves left, both positions decrease.\n\nSo at t1, min position is tail, max position is head, with head > tail.\n\nThen Span(t1) = [tail, head] = [τ, h] if τ is tail, h is head.\n\nBut in the notation for left-moving, it says Span(t1) = [h, τ], which if h is head and higher, τ tail lower, [h, τ] with h>τ is not standard; it should be [τ, h].\n\nBut in the text, for left-moving, it's written as [h, τ], so I think we have to take it as given, meaning the positions from h to τ, but since it's moving left, h is likely the higher end.\n\nFor example, in freeway 4, there is a car (-48, -59, right, 4), so for right-moving, head -48, tail -59, so min = tail = -59, max = head = -48, so span at t1: [-59, -48]\n\nAt time T, min_T = -59 + 4*(T-96)\n\nmax_T = -48 + 4*(T-96)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but in this problem, all cars are right-moving, I think? Let's check the car states.\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)  right-moving\n\nFreeway 2: same, right\n\nFreeway 3: same, right\n\nFreeway 4: three cars, all right, 4: (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4)  head 24, tail 13? 24>13, so for right-moving, min=13, max=24? But tail should be left, head right, so min=tail, max=head.\n\nIn (24,13,right,4), head=24, tail=13, so min=13, max=24 at t1.\n\nSimilarly, (-12,-23,right,4), min=-23, max=-12\n\n(-48,-59,right,4), min=-59, max=-48\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nFreeway 5: (-48,-59,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\n(0,-11,right,12), head=0, tail=-11, so min=-11, max=0 at t1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6,7,8 same as 5: each has two cars: one with head -48 tail -59, and one with head 0 tail -11, all right-moving speed 12.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3 have only one car each: head -48 tail -59, right, speed 3.\n\nFreeway 4 has three cars with speed 4.\n\nFreeway 5-8 have two cars with speed 12.\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so no left-moving cars. That simplifies things.\n\nSo for all cars, at time t1=96, min position = tail, max position = head.\n\nAt time T = t1 + τ, with τ = T - t1,\n\nmin_T = tail + s * τ\n\nmax_T = head + s * τ\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway k, and for some car on k, 0 is between min_T and max_T inclusive.\n\nThe player position at turn T is y_T.\n\ny starts at 0 at t1, and we apply actions.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe key point is that when we move, we are only on the freeway at the turn when we are there, and collision is checked at that turn.\n\nAlso, when we change y, at turn T, if we move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1, at turn T we are on y_T, so we check collision for y_T at turn T.\n\nThe note says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will not be considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so only collision on y_T at turn T matters.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you may collide with cars on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nNow, the goal is to go from y=0 to y=9 in min turns.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0 or y=9, no cars, so no collision possible there. Only when on y=1 to 8, we need to avoid collision.\n\nWe start at (0,0) at t1, which is y=0, safe.\n\nWe need to end at (0,9), y=9, safe.\n\nThe player can move up, down, or stay, so y changes by -1,0,1 per turn, bounded.\n\nTo minimize H, we probably want to go up as fast as possible, but we have to avoid the cars on the freeways.\n\nSo I need to find a path from y=0 to y=9 in min time, such that for each turn when we are on y=1 to 8, 0 is not in the car span for that freeway at that turn.\n\nSince we start at turn t1=96, and we need to find actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nAt turn t1, we are at y=0. Now, we can choose an action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf we choose U, at turn t1+1, we go to y=1.\n\nAt turn t1, we are at y=0, which is safe, no cars.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, if we go to y=1, we are on freeway 1 at turn t1+1, so we need to check if there is a collision on freeway 1 at turn t1+1.\n\nSimilarly for other turns.\n\nFirst, let's list the car positions for each freeway as a function of τ, where τ = T - t1, so T = t1 + τ.\n\nFor freeway k, the cars on it.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: tail = -59, head = -48, speed s=3, right-moving.\n\nAt time τ (relative), min_τ = -59 + 3*τ\n\nmax_τ = -48 + 3*τ\n\nCollision if 0 is between min_τ and max_τ, i.e., min_τ <= 0 <= max_τ\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1, one car: tail=-59, head=-48, s=3\n\nmin_τ = -59 + 3τ\n\nmax_τ = -48 + 3τ\n\nFreeway 3: same.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: tail=-59, head=-48, s=4\n\nmin1_τ = -59 + 4τ\n\nmax1_τ = -48 + 4τ\n\nSecond car: tail=-23, head=-12, s=4? From table: (-12,-23,right,4) head=-12, tail=-23, so min = tail = -23, max = head = -12\n\nAt τ, min2_τ = -23 + 4τ\n\nmax2_τ = -12 + 4τ\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,4) head=24, tail=13, min=13, max=24\n\nmin3_τ = 13 + 4τ\n\nmax3_τ = 24 + 4τ\n\nNow for freeway 4, collision if for any of these three cars, min_τ <= 0 <= max_τ.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst: tail=-59, head=-48, s=12\n\nmin1_τ = -59 + 12τ\n\nmax1_τ = -48 + 12τ\n\nSecond: (0,-11,right,12) head=0, tail=-11, min=-11, max=0 at τ=0.\n\nAt τ, min2_τ = -11 + 12τ\n\nmax2_τ = 0 + 12τ = 12τ\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6,7,8 same as 5: each has car1: min1_τ = -59 +12τ, max1_τ = -48 +12τ\n\ncar2: min2_τ = -11 +12τ, max2_τ = 12τ\n\nNow, for each freeway k and time τ, I need to know if it is safe to be on k at time τ, meaning no car on k has min_τ <= 0 <= max_τ.\n\nSince all cars are on the same freeway, we need for all cars on that freeway, 0 not in [min, max].\n\nBut it's easier to find when it is unsafe, i.e., when collision occurs.\n\nThe player starts at y=0 at τ=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny-position changes with actions.\n\nLet me define the time from start: let t be the turn index from t1, so at time t=0 (τ=0), position y=0.\n\nWe apply action at each turn t=0,1,2,... for H turns, so at turn t, we are at position y_t, and after H turns, at turn t=H-1, we should be at y=9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t1 + t, for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAt time t (relative), after action at time t, position is y_{t+1}? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nFrom the player update:\n\nAt turn t, we are at position y_t.\n\nThen we choose action a_t, which determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThe position at the beginning of turn t is y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, at the end of turn t, we move to y_{t+1}, which is the position for turn t+1.\n\nBut for collision, it says: collision occurs at turn T if at that turn, y_T is between 1 and 8, and 0 in span for some car on y_T at turn T.\n\nTurn T is when we are at position y_T.\n\nSo at turn T, we are on y_T, and we check collision for that freeway at that time.\n\nThen we choose action to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nIn terms of relative time, let τ be the turn index, starting from τ=0 at t1.\n\nAt τ=0, position y_0 = 0 (given).\n\nWe choose action a_0 for turn t1.\n\nThen at τ=1, position y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0, and so on.\n\nAfter H turns, at τ=H-1, position y_{H-1} = 9.\n\nThe sequence is for turns t1 to t1 + H-1, with actions a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-2}? Let's see the output.\n\nThe answer should be actions for turn t1, t1+1, ..., up to when we reach.\n\nWe start at turn t1, position (0,0).\n\nAfter H actions, we reach position (0,9) at some turn.\n\nSince we apply one action per turn, from turn t1 to t1 + H - 1, we apply H actions: at turn t1, a_{t1} to go to y1, at turn t1+1, a_{t1+1} to go to y2, ..., at turn t1 + H - 1, a_{t1 + H - 1} to go to y_H, and we want y_H = 9.\n\nAt turn t, we apply a_t to determine y_{t+1}.\n\nBut at turn t, we are at y_t, and collision is checked based on y_t at time t.\n\nFor example, at turn t1 (τ=0), we are at y=0, safe, no collision check needed or possible since not on freeway.\n\nThen we choose a_{t1}, which will move us to y1 at turn t1+1 (τ=1).\n\nAt turn t1+1, we are at y1, and if y1 between 1 and 8, we check collision for that freeway at time t1+1.\n\nSimilarly for each turn.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, we are at y_H, and we want y_H = 9.\n\nThe turns for actions are from t1 to t1 + H - 1, so H actions over H turns.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t = t1 to t1 + H - 1.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be Turn t1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, ..., up to the last action before reaching.\n\nBut at the turn when we reach, we are at y=9, but the action might be to stay or something, but since we want to reach and stop, probably the last action gets us to 9.\n\nTo minimize H, we need the smallest H such that we can go from y=0 to y=9 in H steps with no collision on the way.\n\nEach step we can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nThe min H is at least 9, since we need to go from 0 to 9, so at least 9 up moves, but we can move down or stay, so H could be more than 9 if we detour or wait.\n\nBut to minimize, we want H as small as possible, so ideally H=9 with all U actions.\n\nBut we need to check if that is possible without collision.\n\nIf not, we might need to wait or go down at some points.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can go directly up from τ=1 to τ=9, from y=1 to y=9 at times τ=1 to 9.\n\nAt each τ, when on freeway k, check if safe.\n\ny_τ = τ for τ from 1 to 9, if we go up each time.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0, not on freeway.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, on freeway 1.\n\nCheck freeway 1 at time τ=1.\n\nFreeway 1 car: min_τ = -59 + 3*1 = -56\n\nmax_τ = -48 + 3*1 = -45\n\n0 between -56 and -45? -56 <= 0 <= -45? 0 > -45? -45 is negative, 0 > -45, so 0 not <= -45, so 0 not in [-56,-45], so safe. min=-56, max=-45, both negative, 0 not in between.\n\nSimilarly at τ=2, y=2, freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 same as 1, min= -59+6= -53, max=-48+6=-42, both neg, 0 not in range.\n\nτ=3, y=3, freeway 3.\n\nmin= -59+9= -50, max=-48+9=-39, both neg, safe.\n\nτ=4, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 has three cars.\n\nAt τ=4:\n\nFirst car: min1 = -59 +4*4 = -59+16= -43, max1= -48+16= -32\n\n0 not in [-43,-32]\n\nSecond car: min2 = -23 +4*4 = -23+16= -7, max2= -12+16=4\n\nmin2_τ = -23 +4τ, at τ=4, -23+16= -7\n\nmax2_τ = -12 +16=4\n\nSo span [-7,4], and 0 is between -7 and 4? -7 <= 0 <= 4, yes, 0 is in the interval, so collision if on freeway 4 at τ=4.\n\nFor car2 on freeway 4, at τ=4, min=-7, max=4, 0 is within, so unsafe.\n\nThird car: min3=13+16=29, max3=24+16=40, 0 not in [29,40]\n\nBut car2 has 0 in span, so freeway 4 is unsafe at τ=4.\n\nTherefore, if we are on y=4 at τ=4, collision occurs.\n\nBut in our direct up path, at τ=4, we are on y=4, so collision.\n\nThus, cannot go directly up at τ=4 for freeway 4.\n\nNow, τ=5, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 cars:\n\nCar1: min1= -59 +12*5 = -59 +60=1, max1= -48+60=12\n\nAt τ=5, min1= -59 + 12*5 = -59+60=1, max1=-48+60=12, so [1,12], 0 not in, since min=1>0.\n\nCar2: min2= -11 +12*5 = -11+60=49, max2=0+60=60, [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nBoth safe, so freeway 5 safe at τ=5.\n\nBut at τ=4 we have problem.\n\nτ=6, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nSimilar to 5, car1 min= -59+72=13, max=-48+72=24, [13,24] no 0\n\nCar2 min= -11+72=61, max=72, no 0, safe.\n\nτ=7, y=7, freeway 7, same, min1= -59+84=25, max1=36, no 0; min2=73, max=84, no 0.\n\nτ=8, y=8, freeway 8, min1= -59+96=37, max1=48; min2=85, max=96, no 0.\n\nτ=9, y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nBut at τ=4, on y=4, collision.\n\nSo direct up in 9 steps not possible because of freeway 4 at τ=4.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=4 at τ=4.\n\nPossible ways: either delay reaching y=4, or go faster or slower, or detour.\n\nSince we start from y=0, to reach y=9, min steps 9, but we may need to take more steps.\n\nAt τ=4, we must not be on y=4.\n\nWe could be on y=4 at a different time, or skip it, but we have to go through each y from 1 to 8 at some point, but we can stay or move down to avoid certain times.\n\nBut to minimize H, we should avoid unnecessary moves.\n\nFirst, let's find when each freeway is safe or unsafe.\n\nFor each freeway k and time τ, determine if it is safe to be on k at τ.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, min_τ = -59 + 3τ, max_τ = -48 + 3τ\n\n0 in [min_τ, max_τ] iff min_τ <= 0 <= max_τ\n\nSince min_τ < max_τ, we can solve for τ.\n\nmin_τ <= 0: -59 +3τ <=0 => 3τ <=59 => τ <= 59/3 ≈19.666, so τ <=19 since τ integer.\n\n0 <= max_τ: 0 <= -48 +3τ => 48 <=3τ => τ >=16.\n\nSo for τ=16 to 19 inclusive, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, min_τ <=0 <= max_τ: τ >= ceil(48/3)=16, τ <= floor(59/3)=19 since 59/3=19.666, floor 19.\n\nSo unsafe for τ=16,17,18,19.\n\nOther times safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 and 3 same as freeway 1, since same car positions and speed.\n\nSo for k=1,2,3, unsafe at τ=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: min1_τ = -59 +4τ, max1_τ = -48 +4τ\n\n0 in [min1,max1] iff min1 <=0 <= max1\n\nmin1 <=0: -59+4τ <=0 => 4τ <=59 => τ <=14.75, so τ <=14\n\n0 <= max1: 0 <= -48+4τ => 48 <=4τ => τ >=12\n\nSo unsafe for τ=12,13,14\n\nBut only if this car causes collision, but there are other cars.\n\nSimilarly, second car: min2_τ = -23 +4τ, max2_τ = -12 +4τ\n\n0 in [min2,max2] iff min2 <=0 <= max2\n\nmin2 <=0: -23+4τ <=0 => 4τ <=23 => τ <=5.75, τ <=5\n\n0 <= max2: 0 <= -12+4τ => 12 <=4τ => τ >=3\n\nSo unsafe for τ=3,4,5\n\nThird car: min3_τ =13 +4τ, max3_τ =24 +4τ\n\nmin3_τ >=13 >0 for all τ, so 0 never <= max3 since min3>0, so 0 never in [min3,max3], always safe for this car.\n\nNow for freeway 4, unsafe if any car has collision, so unsafe when:\n\n- For car1: τ=12,13,14\n\n- For car2: τ=3,4,5\n\n- Car3 always safe\n\nSo overall, freeway 4 unsafe for τ=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nSafe for other τ.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nCar1: min1_τ = -59 +12τ, max1_τ = -48 +12τ\n\n0 in [min1,max1] iff min1 <=0 <= max1\n\nmin1 <=0: -59+12τ <=0 => 12τ <=59 => τ <=4.916, τ <=4\n\n0 <= max1: 0 <= -48+12τ => 48 <=12τ => τ >=4\n\nSo min1 <=0 for τ<=4, 0<=max1 for τ>=4.\n\nThus at τ=4: min1= -59+48= -11? τ=4, min1= -59+12*4= -59+48= -11, max1= -48+48=0\n\nSo [ -11, 0], min=-11<=0, max=0<=0? 0<=0 is true, so 0 in [-11,0], yes.\n\nAt τ=4, min1= -11 <=0, max1=0 >=0, so 0 in.\n\nAt τ=3: min1= -59+36= -23, max1= -48+36= -12, both neg, 0 not <= -12? 0 > -12, so not <= max, so 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly τ=5: min1= -59+60=1, max1=12, min=1>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at τ=4 unsafe for car1.\n\nCar2: min2_τ = -11 +12τ, max2_τ = 12τ\n\n0 in [min2,max2] iff min2 <=0 <= max2\n\nmin2 <=0: -11+12τ <=0 => 12τ <=11 => τ <=11/12<1, so τ <=0 since τ integer, τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, min2= -11, max2=0, so 0 in [-11,0].\n\nBut τ=0 is the initial time, but we are on freeway at τ>=1? At τ=0, y=0, not on freeway, so no collision.\n\nFor τ>=1, min2 <=0: -11+12τ <=0 => 12τ <=11 => τ <=0.916, so for τ>=1, min2 = -11+12τ >= -11+12=1>0, so min2 >=1 >0 for τ>=1, thus 0 < min2 <= max2, so 0 not in [min2,max2] for τ>=1.\n\nSimilarly, max2=12τ >=12>0 for τ>=1.\n\nSo car2 safe for all τ>=1.\n\nTherefore for freeway 5, only unsafe at τ=4 because of car1.\n\nAt τ=4, car1 has span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nCar2 at τ=4: min2= -11+48=37? τ=4, min2= -11 +12*4= -11+48=37, max2=48, [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nBut car1 causes unsafe at τ=4.\n\nSafe for other τ.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6,7,8, same as 5, since each has identical cars.\n\nSo for k=5,6,7,8, unsafe only at τ=4.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway and time τ when unsafe:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe τ=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 2: same, τ=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 3: same, τ=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe τ=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe τ=4\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe τ=4\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe τ=4\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe τ=4\n\nNow, we need to go from y=0 at τ=0 to y=9 at some τ=H, with y_τ changing by at most 1 each step.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=0\n\nAfter action at τ=0, at τ=1, y1\n\nThen at τ=1, on y1 if 1<=y1<=8, check collision.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo reach y=9, min τ when we can be at y=9 is τ=9 if all up.\n\nBut we saw at τ=4, if y=4, collision on freeway 4 or 5-8.\n\nSpecifically, if at τ=4, y=4, then on freeway 4 which is unsafe at τ=4, or if y=5, on freeway 5, unsafe at τ=4, etc.\n\nAt τ=4, if on any freeway y=1 to 8, it might be unsafe.\n\nBut for y=1,2,3 at τ=4: freeway 1 unsafe only at τ=16-19, so at τ=4, freeway 1 is safe, similarly freeway 2 and 3 safe at τ=4.\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe at τ=4.\n\nFreeway 5-8 unsafe at τ=4.\n\nSo at τ=4, only freeways 1,2,3 are safe; freeways 4,5,6,7,8 are unsafe.\n\nBut we can be on y=1,2,3 at τ=4 safely.\n\nIn the direct up path, at τ=4 we are on y=4, which is unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, we could be on a different y at τ=4.\n\nFor example, at τ=4, if we are on y=3, it is safe.\n\nThen we can go up later.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nMin H=9 might be possible with a small detour.\n\nSince at τ=4, y=4 is bad, but y=3 is good, so we can go slower at the beginning.\n\nFor example: start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nChoose action: if we stay or down, we delay, but better to go up if possible.\n\nAt τ=0, we can choose U to go to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nOr S to stay at y=0, or D to y=-1, but y cannot be negative, y in [0,9], so D from 0 not possible, or S stay at 0.\n\nBut staying at 0 doesn't help, we need to go up.\n\nSimilarly, from 0, only U or S possible, S wastes time.\n\nSo better to go U at τ=0 to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, on freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 at τ=1: min= -59+3= -56, max= -45, both neg, safe, as before.\n\nNow, at τ=1, we can choose action to go to y=2 at τ=2, or stay or down.\n\nIf we go U, to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=2, freeway 2, min= -59+6= -53, max= -42, safe.\n\nGo U to y=3 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=3, freeway 3, min= -59+9= -50, max= -39, safe.\n\nNow at τ=3, we need to choose action for τ=3.\n\nIf we go U to y=4 at τ=4, but at τ=4, y=4 is unsafe on freeway 4.\n\nIf we stay, y=3 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=3, on freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 at τ=4: since unsafe only at τ=16-19, τ=4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down, but from y=3, down to y=2, but that might not help.\n\nSo at τ=3, we can choose S to stay at y=3 for τ=4.\n\nThen at τ=4, y=3, safe on freeway 3.\n\nNow at τ=4, we can choose action to go to y=4 at τ=5, for example.\n\nBut at τ=5, if we go to y=4, on freeway 4 at τ=5.\n\nFreeway 4 at τ=5: unsafe for τ=5 because of car2? Earlier freeway 4 unsafe τ=3,4,5.\n\nτ=5: for car2, min2= -23+4*5= -23+20= -3, max2= -12+20=8, so [-3,8], 0 in it, yes unsafe.\n\nCar1 at τ=5: min1= -59+20= -39, max1= -48+20= -28, both neg, safe.\n\nCar3 safe.\n\nBut car2 unsafe, so freeway 4 unsafe at τ=5.\n\nSimilarly τ=3,4,5 all unsafe for freeway 4.\n\nSo at τ=5, if on y=4, collision.\n\nWe need to be on y=4 at a time when freeway 4 is safe.\n\nFreeway 4 safe when not τ=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nFor example, τ=6: freeway 4 at τ=6.\n\nCar1 min= -59+24= -35, max= -48+24= -24, both neg, safe.\n\nCar2 min= -23+24=1, max= -12+24=12, min=1>0, 0 not in [1,12], safe.\n\nCar3 min=13+24=37>0, safe.\n\nSo τ=6 safe for freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly τ=2: car1 min= -59+8= -51, max= -48+8= -40, safe\n\nCar2 min= -23+8= -15, max= -12+8= -4, both neg, 0 not <= -4? 0 > -4, not <= max, so not in, safe? min=-15<=0, but max=-4 <0, so 0 not <= max, since max negative, so 0 not in [min,max].\n\nSimilarly, car3 min=13+8=21>0, safe.\n\nSo τ=2 safe.\n\nτ=1: car1 min= -59+4= -55? τ=1 for freeway 4? Time τ for the turn.\n\nAt τ=1, freeway 4: car1 min= -59+4*1= -55, max= -48+4= -44, safe\n\nCar2 min= -23+4= -19, max= -12+4= -8, both neg, 0 not in\n\nSafe.\n\nτ=0 not relevant.\n\nSo freeway 4 safe for τ<=2 or τ>=6, except τ=12,13,14 but for early times, safe for τ=0,1,2,6,7,... until τ=12.\n\nFor min H, we care about early τ.\n\nSo to be on y=4 safely, we can be at τ=2 or τ=6, etc.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nNow back to the path.\n\nAt τ=3, we are at y=3.\n\nInstead of going to y=4 at τ=4, we stay at y=3 at τ=4.\n\nThen at τ=4, we are at y=3, safe.\n\nNow at τ=4, we can choose to go to y=4 at τ=5, but at τ=5, y=4 is unsafe.\n\nGo to y=3 or y=2 or y=5.\n\ny=5 at τ=5: on freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 at τ=5: unsafe only at τ=4, so at τ=5 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at τ=5 unsafe, y=5 at τ=5 safe.\n\nBut we need to go to y=4 eventually.\n\nFrom τ=4, y=3, we can go up to y=4 at τ=5, but unsafe, or stay, or go down, but not efficient.\n\nGo up to y=4 later.\n\nSince freeway 4 is safe at τ=6, we can be at y=4 at τ=6.\n\nBut we are at y=3 at τ=4.\n\nIf we go up at τ=4 to y=4 at τ=5, unsafe.\n\nAt τ=4, y=3, we can choose to stay again: S, so at τ=5, y=3 still.\n\nBut on freeway 3 at τ=5.\n\nFreeway 3 at τ=5: unsafe only τ=16-19, so safe.\n\nThen at τ=5, we can go to y=4 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, y=4, on freeway 4 at τ=6, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen from there, we can go up to y=5,6,etc.\n\nNow, let's see the timing.\n\nStart:\n\nτ=0: y=0, choose a: U → y=1 at τ=1\n\nτ=1: y=1, on freeway 1, safe. Choose U → y=2 at τ=2\n\nτ=2: y=2, on freeway 2, safe. Choose U → y=3 at τ=3\n\nτ=3: y=3, on freeway 3, safe. Now, instead of U, choose S → so y=3 at τ=4 (since stay)\n\nAt τ=4: y=3, on freeway 3, safe. Choose S again? Or to go up later.\n\nAt τ=4, y=3, choose S → y=3 at τ=5\n\nτ=5: y=3, on freeway 3, safe. Now choose U → y=4 at τ=6\n\nτ=6: y=4, on freeway 4 at τ=6, safe (as τ=6 safe for freeway 4)\n\nThen from here, we need to go to y=9.\n\nAt τ=6, y=4, choose U → y=5 at τ=7\n\nAt τ=7, y=5, on freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 at τ=7: unsafe only τ=4, so safe.\n\nChoose U → y=6 at τ=8\n\nτ=8: y=6, freeway 6, unsafe only τ=4, safe.\n\nU → y=7 at τ=9\n\nτ=9: y=7, freeway 7, safe.\n\nU → y=8 at τ=10\n\nτ=10: y=8, freeway 8, safe? τ=10, freeway 8 unsafe only τ=4, safe.\n\nU → y=9 at τ=11\n\nτ=11: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nNow, we reached y=9 at τ=11.\n\nTotal turns: from τ=0 to τ=11, we have 12 steps? Let's list the actions.\n\nAt each turn, we apply action to determine next y.\n\nAt turn relative τ, position y_τ.\n\nAction at τ determines y_{τ+1}.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=0\n\nAction a_0: U → y_1 =1 at τ=1\n\na_1: U → y_2=2 at τ=2\n\na_2: U → y_3=3 at τ=3\n\na_3: S → y_4 = y_3 =3 (since S, Δy=0, so y_{τ+1} = y_τ)\n\nAt τ=3, action S, so y_{4} = y_3 =3\n\nAt τ=4, y=3, action: we can choose.\n\nIn the above, at τ=4, y=3, we choose S → y_5=3 at τ=5\n\nThen at τ=5, y=3, choose U → y_6=4 at τ=6\n\nThen a_6: U → y_7=5 at τ=7\n\na_7: U → y_8=6 at τ=8\n\na_8: U → y_9=7 at τ=9\n\na_9: U → y_10=8 at τ=10\n\na_10: U → y_11=9 at τ=11\n\nNow, at τ=11, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from τ=0 to τ=10, that's 11 actions.\n\nTurns: actions at τ=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 → 11 actions.\n\nPosition reached at τ=11.\n\nH = number of turns from start to end? In the sequence, we have actions from t1 to t1 + H -1, and position at t1 + H is y=9.\n\nHere, after 11 actions, at turn t1 + 11, position y=9.\n\nMinimal H? H=11, but we might do better.\n\nWe wasted two turns staying at y=3.\n\nCan we avoid one stay?\n\nAt τ=3, y=3, instead of staying, we could go down to y=2, but that might not help.\n\nOr, we could go directly to y=4 at a safe time.\n\nAnother idea: go faster in the beginning to be at higher y earlier.\n\nBut from y=0, we can only go up one per turn, so at τ=3, we are at y=3 max.\n\nUnless we start later, but we need to start from τ=0.\n\nAt τ=3, y=3, we must not go to y=4 at τ=4, so we need to be at y=4 at τ≠4,5? τ=5 also unsafe for y=4.\n\nSo earliest safe for y=4 is τ=6.\n\nBut to be at y=4 at τ=6, we need to reach y=4 by τ=6.\n\nSince we start from y=0 at τ=0, we can reach y=4 by τ=4 with all up, but unsafe.\n\nWith delay, we reach at τ=6.\n\nBut to reach y=4 at τ=6, we can have different paths.\n\nFor example, from τ=3, y=3, if we go up at τ=3 to y=4 at τ=4, unsafe.\n\nSo we must stay or go down at τ=3.\n\nIf we stay at τ=3, y=3 at τ=4.\n\nThen at τ=4, we can go to y=4 at τ=5, but τ=5 y=4 unsafe.\n\nGo to y=5 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=4, y=3, we choose U → y=4 at τ=5? But y=4 at τ=5 unsafe.\n\nChoose D → y=2 at τ=5, but then we go down, worse.\n\nOr choose U to y=4? No.\n\nAt τ=4, y=3, we can choose to go up to y=4 at τ=5, but unsafe, so not possible.\n\nGo to y=5 directly? From y=3 to y=5 in one step? No, can only change by 1, so from y=3, actions: U to y=4, D to y=2, S to y=3.\n\nCannot jump to y=5.\n\nSo at τ=4, from y=3, we can only go to y=2,3,4 at τ=5.\n\ny=4 at τ=5 unsafe, y=3 or y=2 at τ=5.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nTo be at y=4 at τ=6, we can, for example, at τ=4, y=3, choose S → y=3 at τ=5\n\nThen at τ=5, y=3, choose U → y=4 at τ=6\n\nAs before.\n\nAt τ=4, y=3, choose U → y=4 at τ=5, but unsafe, collision, not allowed.\n\nSo must avoid that.\n\nThus, the delay is necessary.\n\nBut we have to go through freeway 5-8, which have unsafe only at τ=4, but since we are not at τ=4 for those, it might be ok.\n\nIn the path above, we reached in 11 turns.\n\nBut perhaps we can go faster later or something.\n\nAnother point: at τ=4, we are at y=3, but we could be at y=2 or y=1, but that would require going down earlier, which takes more time, worse.\n\nFor example, at τ=3, instead of staying, go down to y=2 at τ=4.\n\nThen at τ=4, y=2, on freeway 2, safe.\n\nThen at τ=4, choose U to y=3 at τ=5, then U to y=4 at τ=6, same as before but we have an extra down and up, so more steps.\n\nWorse than staying.\n\nSo staying is better.\n\nThus min H with this path is 11.\n\nBut we might be able to reach y=4 earlier at a safe time.\n\nFreeway 4 safe at τ=2, for example.\n\nAt τ=2, if we are on y=4, but at τ=2, we are at y=2 if we go up directly, not y=4.\n\nTo be at y=4 at τ=2, we need to go faster, but from y=0 at τ=0, in two steps, we can be at y=2 max, not y=4.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSimilarly, τ=1, y=1 max.\n\nSo cannot be at y=4 before τ=4 with all up.\n\nAt τ=4 is unsafe, τ=5 unsafe, so earliest safe is τ=6.\n\nThus, we must reach y=4 at τ=6 or later.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways, but freeway 5-8 unsafe only at τ=4, so as long as we are not on them at τ=4, ok.\n\nIn the path, we go through y=5 to 8 at τ=7 to 10, all after τ=4, so safe.\n\nNow, from y=4 at τ=6, we go up each step to y=9 at τ=11.\n\nTotal actions from τ=0 to τ=10, 11 actions.\n\nBut τ=10 action to y=11? No.\n\nActions at τ=0 to τ=10, positions y_1 to y_11.\n\ny_11=9 at τ=11.\n\nThe number of turns: from t1 to t1+10, actions at t1 to t1+10, 11 turns, position at t1+11=9.\n\nH should be the number of actions? Let's see the task.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\" no.\n\nIt says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"? Let's read.\n\n\"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nIn the task: \"minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nIn terms of relative time.\n\nAt relative time τ, y_τ.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter H actions? The position at time t1 + H -1 is y_{H-1} relative? Set τ=0 at t1.\n\nAt turn t1 + t for t=0,1,2,...\n\nPosition at turn t1 + t is y_t.\n\nAction at turn t1 + t determines y_{t+1}.\n\ny_{t} at turn t1 + t.\n\nThen y_{t1 + H - 1} =9, meaning at turn index H-1 relative, y_{H-1}=9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, at turn t1 +0 = t1, y_0=9, but we start at y_0=0, so impossible for H=1.\n\nMin H=9, at turn t1+8, y_8=9 if all up.\n\nBut in our case.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nPosition at turn t1+t is y_t.\n\nWe want y_{H-1} =9 at turn t1 + (H-1).\n\nIn our earlier path, we have y_11=9 at τ=11, so H-1=11, H=12? Let's see.\n\ny_{H-1} =9.\n\nIn relative, at time τ = H-1, y_{H-1}=9.\n\nIn our path, at τ=11, y=9, so H-1=11, thus H=12.\n\nBut we have 11 actions? I think I confused.\n\nList the turns:\n\nTurn t1 (τ=0): position y=0, we choose action a_{t1}\n\nAfter action, at turn t1+1 (τ=1), position y1 = y0 + Δy0\n\nGenerally, at turn t1 + t, position y_t\n\nWe apply action a_{t1 + t} to determine Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAt turn t1 + t, position is y_t.\n\nWe want at some turn, y_k =9.\n\nSpecifically, y_{t1 + H - 1} =9, so for relative index, let k = H-1, y_k=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t=0 to H-1, meaning actions at turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, the position is y_H at turn t1+H.\n\nBut we want y_{H-1} =9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nFor example, if we reach at turn t1, y_0=9, but we start at y_0=0, so not possible.\n\nIf we go all up: actions at t1: U, then at t1+1, y1=1\n\na_{t1+1}: U, at t1+2, y2=2\n\n...\n\na_{t1+8}: U, at t1+9, y9=9\n\nSo at turn t1+9, y9=9, so H-1=9, thus H=10.\n\nActions from t1 to t1+9? t from 0 to H-1=9, so actions at t1 to t1+9, 10 actions, position at t1+10? No.\n\nAt turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, actions a_{t1+t}\n\nAfter a_{t1+t}, position at turn t1+t+1 is y_{t+1}\n\nWe want position at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, position y_{H-1} =9.\n\nIn the all up case: at turn t1+9, y9=9, so t1 + H -1 = t1 +9, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nAnd actions at t1 to t1+8, since t=0 to 8 for H=10? t from 0 to H-1=9, so actions at t1+0 to t1+9? H-1=9, so t=0 to 8? Let's index.\n\nSet: actions applied at turns: let s be the turn index from t1.\n\nAction at s = t1 + i for i=0 to H-1\n\nThen position after action at s is at turn s+1.\n\nAt turn s, position y_s.\n\nAfter action at s, position at turn s+1 is y_{s+1} = y_s + Δy_s\n\nWe want at turn t = t1 + H -1, y_t =9.\n\nFor t = t1 + H -1.\n\nSince t1 + H -1 = s for some s.\n\nIn terms of i: action at t1+i for i=0 to H-1\n\nThen position at turn (t1+i) +1 = t1 + i+1\n\nWe want this to be 9 at some i+1.\n\nSpecifically, at turn t1 + H -1, we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe position at turn t1 + H -1 is y_{t1 + H -1}\n\nThis must be 9.\n\nNow, when is this position determined? It is the position after the action at turn t1 + H -2, or before?\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, we are at position y_{t1 + H -1}\n\nTo have that, it depends on previous actions.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nIn our case, with the path, we have at τ=11, y=9, so turn t1 + 11, so t1 + H -1 = t1 +11, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nBut let's list with actions.\n\nIn the path I described:\n\nAt turn t1 (τ=0): position y=0, choose action a_{t1} = U → position at t1+1: y=1\n\nTurn t1+1 (τ=1): position y=1, choose a_{t1+1} = U → position at t1+2: y=2\n\nTurn t1+2 (τ=2): position y=2, choose a_{t1+2} = U → position at t1+3: y=3\n\nTurn t1+3 (τ=3): position y=3, choose a_{t1+3} = S → position at t1+4: y=3 (since S)\n\nTurn t1+4 (τ=4): position y=3, choose a_{t1+4} = S → position at t1+5: y=3\n\nTurn t1+5 (τ=5): position y=3, choose a_{t1+5} = U → position at t1+6: y=4\n\nTurn t1+6 (τ=6): position y=4, choose a_{t1+6} = U → position at t1+7: y=5\n\nTurn t1+7 (τ=7): position y=5, choose a_{t1+7} = U → position at t1+8: y=6\n\nTurn t1+8 (τ=8): position y=6, choose a_{t1+8} = U → position at t1+9: y=7\n\nTurn t1+9 (τ=9): position y=7, choose a_{t1+9} = U → position at t1+10: y=8\n\nTurn t1+10 (τ=10): position y=8, choose a_{t1+10} = U → position at t1+11: y=9\n\nAt turn t1+11, position y=9.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nHere at turn t1+11, so t1 + H -1 = t1 +11, thus H-1=11, H=12.\n\nAnd actions from turn t1 to t1+10, which is 11 actions, for t=0 to 10, H-1=10? t from 0 to H-1, so for H=12, t=0 to 11, actions at t1 to t1+11.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have actions at t1 to t1+10, that's 11 actions, so for H=12, we need actions up to t1+11.\n\nAt turn t1+10, we choose U, which sets position at t1+11 to 9.\n\nAt turn t1+11, we are at y=9, but we don't need an action after that, I think.\n\nThe action sequence is to reach the position.\n\nIn the task, the sequence of actions is until we reach, but the last action gets us to 9.\n\nIn the output, it should be the actions from t1 to the turn before reaching 9.\n\nIn this case, at turn t1+10, we apply U to go to y=9 at t1+11.\n\nSo actions at t1 to t1+10.\n\nNumber of actions: 11.\n\nH is the number of turns, which includes the turns where actions are taken.\n\nFrom turn t1 to t1+H-1, actions taken.\n\nPosition at t1+H-1 is after the action? No.\n\nAt turn t1+H-1, we apply an action, which determines the position at the next turn, but we want the position at this turn to be 9.\n\nAt turn t1+H-1, position y_{t1+H-1}, and we want this to be 9.\n\nThen, to achieve that, the action at t1+H-1 might be S or something, but it's the position at that turn.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t1+H-1, we are at position 9, and we may not need to specify an action if we stop, but the sequence includes actions up to that point.\n\nThe answer format shows actions for each turn, so for turn t1 to t1+H-1, with the position at that turn set, and action chosen.\n\nBut the position at turn t is before action.\n\nThen after action, position changes for next turn.\n\nWe want at turn t1+H-1, position=9.\n\nIn the path, at turn t1+11, position=9.\n\nSo for that to be t1+H-1, so t1+H-1 = t1+11, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions at turns t1 to t1+11? But at turn t1+11, if position is 9, we might choose no action or S, but we need to specify action for that turn.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t1+H-1, we are at position 9, and we can choose S or whatever, but since we reached, probably S is fine, but it doesn't matter.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nIn our case, with 11 actions, we have position at t1+11=9, so if we set H=12, then at turn t1+11 = t1+H-1, position=9.\n\nActions at t1 to t1+10 for the moves, and at t1+11, we need an action, but since we are already at 9, we can choose S.\n\nBut in the sequence, it might be included.\n\nFor efficiency, since we reached, the last action can be S or not, but it doesn't affect H.\n\nH is the number of turns from start to when we are at 9, including the turn we are at 9? I think H is the number of actions or turns in the sequence.\n\nLet's look back at the task.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nSo the sequence has H actions, for t=0 to H-1, at turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nPosition at turn t1 + H -1 is y_{t1+H-1}, which is set to 9.\n\nAt turn t1+H-1, we are at position 9, and we apply action a_{t1+H-1}, which might change position, but since we want to be at 9, probably we choose S if we are already at 9, or U/D to stay or move, but we can choose S to stay at 9.\n\nIn the sequence, for the turn when we reach, if we reach at that turn, we can choose S.\n\nBut in our path, we reach at turn t1+11, so for H=12, actions from t=0 to 11, at turns t1 to t1+11.\n\nAt turn t1+11, position is 9, and we choose a_{t1+11} = S, for example.\n\nBut we don't need to move further.\n\nTo save actions, we can have the last action be the one that brings us to 9.\n\nFor example, in the all up case with no delay, at turn t1+8, we choose U, and at turn t1+9, position=9.\n\nSo at turn t1+8, we are at y=8, choose U, so at turn t1+9, y=9.\n\nThen y_{t1+9} =9, so t1+H-1 = t1+9, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions at t1 to t1+8, 9 actions.\n\nIn our delayed path, at turn t1+10, we are at y=8, choose U, so at turn t1+11, y=9.\n\nSo y_{t1+11} =9, so t1+H-1 = t1+11, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions at t1 to t1+10, 11 actions.\n\nBut we have two S actions, which are wasteful.\n\nCan we reduce H?\n\nFor example, instead of staying twice, stay only once.\n\nAt τ=3, y=3, we must not go to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nBut we can go to y=5 at τ=5, but we can't directly.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 4 is safe at τ=6, and freeway 5-8 are safe except τ=4, we can go to y=4 at τ=6, then up.\n\nBut to reach y=4 at τ=6, from y=0 at τ=0, min steps: with all up, at τ=4 y=4, but unsafe, so we need to delay to τ=6.\n\nWith delay, at τ=4 y=3, τ=5 y=3, τ=6 y=4, so we used two extra turns.\n\nIf we can be at higher y earlier, but we can't because we start from low.\n\nAt τ=3, y=3, we could go down to y=2 at τ=4, but then at τ=4, y=2, safe, but then we need to go up to y=3 at τ=5, then to y=4 at τ=6, same as before but with more changes.\n\nNo better.\n\nPerhaps skip some freeways, but we have to go through each y, but we can stay on a freeway if safe, but to go up, we need to move.\n\nFor example, on freeway 3, it is safe at τ=4, so we can stay at y=3 for multiple turns, but that doesn't help to go up.\n\nIn fact, staying longer only increases H.\n\nSo min H is 11 for the position, with H=12 for the turns.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach in 10 turns or less.\n\nSuppose we want y_{t1+H-1} =9 with smaller H.\n\nFor example, H=10: then y_{t1+9} =9.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn t1+9.\n\nFrom y=0 at t1, to y=9 at t1+9, that means in 9 steps, from position at t1+1 to t1+9, we need to increase y from some value.\n\nAt turn t1, y=0.\n\nAfter action at t1, at t1+1, y1.\n\nThen at t1+9, y9=9.\n\nThe changes: from y0 to y9, with 9 steps (actions at t1 to t1+8), y9 = y0 + sum of Δy from t=0 to 8.\n\ny0=0, y9=9, so sum_{t=0 to 8} Δy_t =9.\n\nSince |Δy_t| <=1, to increase by 9 in 9 steps, must have all Δy_t = +1, so all actions U, and y_t = t for t from 1 to 9.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=4, collision on freeway 4, impossible.\n\nThus H=10 impossible.\n\nSimilarly, for any H<10, impossible since min steps 9.\n\nH=10 requires reaching in 9 actions, but impossible due to collision.\n\nH=11: y_{t1+10} =9.\n\nThen from y0=0 to y10=9 in 10 steps, sum Δy =9, so net +9 in 10 steps, so possible with one S or one D and extra U, but since we need to delay, S is fine.\n\nIn our case, with two S, we have sum Δy over 11 actions? For H=12, actions from t=0 to 11, 12 actions.\n\ny_{t1+11} =9, from y0=0, so in 11 steps? Positions: from turn t1+1 to t1+11, 11 positions, from y1 to y11=9.\n\ny0=0, y11=9, so changes over 11 steps: y11 = y0 + sum_{t=0 to 10} Δy_t = sum Δy_t =9.\n\nSince 11 actions, sum Δy_t =9, so two of the Δy must be 0 (S), or one -1 and one +1 extra, but S is better.\n\nIn our path, we have two S, so sum Δy = +9 with 11 actions, yes.\n\nCan we do with one S?\n\nFor example, reach y=9 in 10 steps with one delay.\n\nBut to avoid collision at τ=4 y=4, we need to be not at y=4 at τ=4.\n\nIf we can be at y=4 at τ=6 with only one extra turn.\n\nFor example, from start, go up to y=3 at τ=3 as before.\n\nThen at τ=3, instead of staying, we cannot go up, so must stay or down.\n\nIf we stay at τ=3, y=3 at τ=4.\n\nThen at τ=4, from y=3, we can go to y=4 at τ=5, but unsafe.\n\nGo to y=5? Cannot.\n\nSo must go to y=4 at τ=5 or later.\n\nIf we go at τ=5, unsafe.\n\nSo we have to go at τ=6.\n\nThus from τ=4 y=3, we stay at τ=4 to y=3 at τ=5, then up to y=4 at τ=6.\n\nOr at τ=4, from y=3, go down to y=2 at τ=5, then at τ=5, from y=2, go up to y=3 at τ=6, then to y=4 at τ=7, worse.\n\nSo best is to stay at y=3 for two turns: at τ=3 and τ=4 actions S.\n\nThen up to y=4 at τ=6.\n\nThen up to y=9 at τ=11.\n\nThus H=12 is minimal with this path.\n\nBut at τ=6 to τ=11, we go up, but τ=11 y=9.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster on the upper freeways, but no, we go up each step.\n\nAnother point: freeway 4 has unsafe at τ=12-14, but we are at τ=6, far before, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1-3 unsafe at τ=16-19, we are at τ=1,2,3, before, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus minimal H is 12.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions.\n\nActions at each turn relative τ.\n\nτ=0 (t1): U\n\nτ=1 (t1+1): U\n\nτ=2 (t1+2): U\n\nτ=3 (t1+3): S  (stay at y=3)\n\nτ=4 (t1+4): S  (stay at y=3)\n\nτ=5 (t1+5): U  (to y=4)\n\nτ=6 (t1+6): U  (to y=5)\n\nτ=7 (t1+7): U  (to y=6)\n\nτ=8 (t1+8): U  (to y=7)\n\nτ=9 (t1+9): U  (to y=8)\n\nτ=10 (t1+10): U  (to y=9)\n\nAt τ=10, we apply U to go to y=9 at τ=11.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, for H=12, actions at t1 to t1+11.\n\nAt turn t1+11, we are at y=9, and we need to choose an action, but since we reached, we can choose S.\n\nIn the output, for the turn when we are at 9, we can put S.\n\nTo match, in the sequence above, at τ=10 (t1+10), we choose U to go to 9 at next turn.\n\nThen at turn t1+11, position y=9, we choose action a_{t1+11}, which can be S.\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be included.\n\nIn the answer, since we reach at turn t1+11, and H=12, actions from t=0 to 11.\n\nNow for the actions:\n\nTurn t1: U\n\nTurn t1+1: U\n\nTurn t1+2: U\n\nTurn t1+3: S\n\nTurn t1+4: S\n\nTurn t1+5: U\n\nTurn t1+6: U\n\nTurn t1+7: U\n\nTurn t1+8: U\n\nTurn t1+9: U\n\nTurn t1+10: U  // this brings to y=9 at t1+11\n\nAt turn t1+10: position y=8, choose U, so at t1+11, y=9.\n\nThen at turn t1+11: position y=9, we need action, choose S.\n\nBut since we are done, S is fine.\n\nNow, in the sequence, for turn t1+10, we choose U to reach.\n\nBut the position at t1+11 is 9, which is what we want.\n\nIn the sequence of actions, we list up to t1+10 for the moves, but for H=12, we need to include up to t1+11.\n\nPerhaps it's acceptable.\n\nTo save one action, but we need the position at t1+11 to be 9, so we must have the action at t1+10 to be U from 8.\n\nThen at t1+11, we are at 9, and we apply S.\n\nBut the S doesn't change, so H=12.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier with a different path.\n\nFor example, go to y=5 directly at some point, but impossible.\n\nOr, use down to avoid, but that takes more time.\n\nSo I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the car at freeway 4, we have to avoid τ=4, but we did.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5-8, we are not at τ=4 when on them, so safe.\n\nIn the sequence, at τ=5 to τ=10, we are on y=4 to y=8, all after τ=4, safe.\n\nNow, write the actions.\n\nCurrent turn t1=96.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: S\n\nTurn 100: S\n\nTurn 101: U\n\nTurn 102: U\n\nTurn 103: U\n\nTurn 104: U\n\nTurn 105: U\n\nTurn 106: U  // to y=9 at next turn\n\nAt turn 106 (t1+10), we choose U, position at 107 is 9.\n\nThen at turn 107, we need action, but position is 9, so choose S.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 107: S\n\nBut turn 107 is t1+11.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nSince we reach at turn t1+11, and H=12, actions include up to t1+11 with S.\n\nBut the last action S is necessary to complete the sequence.\n\nWe can think that at turn t1+10, position y=8, we choose S, but then at t1+11, y=8, not 9, so we need to choose U later to reach 9 at t1+12, which is worse.\n\nSo better to choose U at t1+10 to reach at t1+11.\n\nThen at t1+11, choose S.\n\nSo the sequence has 12 actions.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision points.\n\nIn the path:\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, freeway 1, safe\n\nτ=2, y=2, freeway 2, safe\n\nτ=3, y=3, freeway 3, safe\n\nτ=4, y=3, freeway 3, safe (since not τ=16-19)\n\nτ=5, y=3, freeway 3, safe\n\nτ=6, y=4, freeway 4, at τ=6, safe as computed\n\nτ=7, y=5, freeway 5, τ=7, safe (not τ=4)\n\nτ=8, y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nτ=9, y=7, freeway 7, safe\n\nτ=10, y=8, freeway 8, safe\n\nτ=11, y=9, safe\n\nNo collision.\n\nAnd we reached in 11 steps from start, but with positions from τ=1 to 11, 11 positions, but start at τ=0 y=0.\n\nMinimal H=12.\n\nPerhaps we can start by staying at y=0 for one turn, but that would delay further, worse.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nThus the sequence.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 96\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is \\(H = 12\\). This is achieved with the following sequence of actions, which ensures the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + 11 = 107\\).\n\nThe sequence avoids collisions by:\n- Moving up to \\(y = 3\\) by turn \\(t_1 + 3 = 99\\).\n- Staying at \\(y = 3\\) for turns \\(t_1 + 3 = 99\\) and \\(t_1 + 4 = 100\\) to avoid being on freeway \\(y = 4\\) at \\(\\tau = 4\\) and \\(\\tau = 5\\) (relative to \\(t_1\\)), where freeway 4 is unsafe due to car spans containing position 0.\n- Proceeding upward from \\(y = 4\\) at \\(\\tau = 6\\) (turn \\(t_1 + 6 = 102\\)), as freeway 4 is safe at this time.\n- Continuing upward without delay, as freeways 5 to 8 are unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 4\\), and the player is on these freeways at later times (\\(\\tau = 7\\) to \\(\\tau = 10\\)), which are safe.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- At turn \\(t_1 = 96\\), action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 97.\n- At turn 97, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 98.\n- At turn 98, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 99.\n- At turn 99, action \\(S\\) stays at \\(y = 3\\) (position remains 3 at turn 100).\n- At turn 100, action \\(S\\) stays at \\(y = 3\\) (position remains 3 at turn 101).\n- At turn 101, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 102.\n- At turn 102, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 103.\n- At turn 103, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 104.\n- At turn 104, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 105.\n- At turn 105, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 106.\n- At turn 106, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 107.\n- At turn 107, action \\(S\\) is chosen since the player is at \\(y = 9\\), and no further movement is needed. This action completes the sequence for \\(H = 12\\).\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions, as verified by checking the car spans at each relevant turn and freeway. For example:\n- At \\(\\tau = 4\\) (turn 100), the player is at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3), which is safe since freeway 3 is unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 16\\) to \\(19\\).\n- At \\(\\tau = 6\\) (turn 102), the player is at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4), which is safe as car spans do not contain 0 (e.g., car 2 span at \\(\\tau = 6\\) is \\([1, 12]\\), excluding 0).\n- Freeways 5 to 8 are unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 4\\), but the player is on these freeways at \\(\\tau = 7\\) to \\(10\\), which are safe.\n\nThe position reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 96 + 12 - 1 = 107\\), satisfying \\(y_{107} = 9\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 96: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 97: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 98: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 99: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 100: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 101: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 102: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 103: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 104: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 105: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 106: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 107: S \\end{array} }",
