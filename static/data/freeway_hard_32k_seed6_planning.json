        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays, changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn. Cars move left or right with constant speed, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway at the same turn that a car's span includes 0.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car positions at each turn. The current turn is t=0, and I have the car states for each freeway.\n\nLooking at freeway 1: cars are (-48, -59, right, 6) and (0, -11, right, 6). Since it's right-moving, the span at time t is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)], but t1 is 0, so for turn T, span is [τ + sT, h + sT].\n\nLet me denote the head and tail. For a right-moving car, head is the front, so for (h, τ, d, s), if d=right, then at time T, position is from τ + sT to h + sT.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]\n\nt1=0, so Span(T) = [τ + sT, h + sT]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h - sT, τ - sT], but all cars here are right-moving, so only right-moving.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, I am on freeway y, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span, meaning the car covers x=0 at that time.\n\nSince I'm always at x=0, I collide if a car on my y at time T has span containing 0.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I have multiple cars, so I need to find when any car on that freeway has 0 in its span.\n\nAlso, note that if I move to a different y, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn.\n\nThe note says: if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, even if they cover 0 at T.\n\nSimilarly, I assume I am on y_T at turn T, so I can collide with cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, I start at (0,0) at turn 0.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nThe vertical axis y=0,1,2,...,9, and freeways y=1 to 8 have cars. So y=0 and y=9 are clear, no collisions possible.\n\nI need to reach (0,9), so starting from (0,0), I need to go up to y=9.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, I just need to cross the freeways y=1 to 8 without getting hit.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so I need at least 9 moves to go from 0 to 9, but I might need to stay or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 9.\n\nBut I want minimal H, so I should go up as fast as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nNow, let's list the cars for each freeway.\n\nAll freeways have similar cars, but not identical.\n\nFreeway 1: cars: (-48, -59, right, 6) and (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 6) and (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 3: same\n\nFreeway 4: same\n\nFreeway 5: (-48, -59, right, 6), (-12, -23, right, 6), (24, 13, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nSo freeways 1-4 have two cars each, freeways 5-8 have three cars each.\n\nAll moving right at speed 6.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find times when it is unsafe, i.e., when some car has 0 in its span.\n\nLet me find for each freeway the times T when collision is possible, meaning 0 is covered by some car at time T.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but we have discrete turns, T is integer.\n\nFor a car, at time T, span is [τ + sT, h + sT] for right-moving.\n\n0 is in [τ + sT, h + sT] if τ + sT ≤ 0 ≤ h + sT.\n\nSince h is head, τ is tail, and for right-moving, h > τ, I assume? In the span, for right-moving, [τ, h] with h > τ, so [τ + sT, h + sT] with h + sT > τ + sT.\n\nSimilarly for left.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1, first car: head h = -48, tail τ = -59, direction right, speed 6.\n\nh = -48, τ = -59? But -48 > -59, so if right-moving, head should be larger, but here h=-48, τ=-59, so h > τ, since -48 > -59, so head at -48, tail at -59, so the car is from -59 to -48? That would be left to right, but positions: if tail at -59, head at -48, that means the front is at -48, back at -59, so if moving right, it should be going to more positive, but let's see the span.\n\nAt time T, for right-moving, span is [τ + sT, h + sT] = [-59 + 6T, -48 + 6T]\n\nNow, 0 is in this interval if -59 + 6T ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 6T\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nSecond car on freeway 1: (0, -11, right, 6), so h=0, τ=-11, so span [ -11 + 6T, 0 + 6T ] = [-11 + 6T, 6T]\n\n0 is in this if -11 + 6T ≤ 0 ≤ 6T, which simplifies to 0 ≤ 6T and -11 + 6T ≤ 0, so 6T ≥ 0 and 6T ≤ 11, so T ≤ 11/6 ≈ 1.833, so for integer T, T=0,1? Let's see.\n\n-11 + 6T ≤ 0 ≤ 6T\n\nFirst, 0 ≤ 6T always for T≥0, since T turn, probably T≥0.\n\nBut 0 ≤ 6T implies T ≥ 0, which is true for all T≥0.\n\nThen -11 + 6T ≤ 0 implies 6T ≤ 11, T ≤ 11/6 = 1.833, so for T=0,1.\n\nSimilarly, for the first car: [-59 + 6T, -48 + 6T], 0 in it if -59 + 6T ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 6T\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 6T ≤ 0 ⇒ 6T ≤ 59 ⇒ T ≤ 59/6 ≈ 9.833\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 6T ⇒ 6T ≥ 48 ⇒ T ≥ 8\n\nSo T from 8 to 9.833, so T=8,9.\n\nBut for freeway 1, at T=0, the second car has span [-11,0]? At T=0, for second car: [ -11 +0, 0+0] = [-11,0], and 0 is included? 0 is the upper bound.\n\n0 ≤ 6T is 0≤0, true, and -11+6T≤0 for T=0: -11≤0 true, so yes, at T=0, 0 is in [-11,0], so collision if on freeway 1 at T=0.\n\nBut I start at y=0, which is not freeway, so at T=0, I'm on y=0, not on freeway, so no collision.\n\nNow for other times.\n\nLet me list for each freeway the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: cars:\n\nCar A: (-48,-59,right,6) → unsafe T when T≥8 and T≤9, so T=8,9\n\nCar B: (0,-11,right,6) → unsafe when T=0,1 as above.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe when either car is unsafe, so T=0,1,8,9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, so unsafe T=0,1,8,9\n\nFreeway 3: same, T=0,1,8,9\n\nFreeway 4: same, T=0,1,8,9\n\nNow freeway 5: three cars\n\nFirst car: same as above, (-48,-59,right,6) → unsafe T=8,9\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,6) → span [ -23 +6T, -12 +6T ]\n\n0 in it if -23+6T ≤ 0 ≤ -12+6T\n\nFirst: -23+6T ≤0 ⇒ 6T≤23 ⇒ T≤23/6≈3.833\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -12+6T ⇒ 6T≥12 ⇒ T≥2\n\nSo T=2,3\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,6) → head=24, tail=13, so span [13+6T, 24+6T]\n\n0 in it if 13+6T ≤0 ≤24+6T\n\nFirst inequality 13+6T ≤0 ⇒ 6T≤-13, impossible since T≥0\n\nSecond 0≤24+6T always true for T≥0\n\nBut 13+6T ≤0 cannot hold, so 0 never in [13+6T,24+6T] since min is 13>0 at T=0, increases.\n\nSo only unsafe for first and second cars.\n\nSo freeway 5 unsafe at T=2,3 (from second car) and T=8,9 (from first car)\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6,7,8 same as 5.\n\nFreeway 6,7,8 have same cars as 5.\n\nNow summarize unsafe times for each freeway:\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=0,1,8,9\n\ny=2: same as y=1, T=0,1,8,9\n\ny=3: same, T=0,1,8,9\n\ny=4: same, T=0,1,8,9\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=2,3,8,9\n\ny=6: same as y=5, T=2,3,8,9\n\ny=7: same, T=2,3,8,9\n\ny=8: same, T=2,3,8,9\n\nI need to go from y=0 at T=0 to y=9, and I move at each turn.\n\nLet t be the turn number, starting from t=0.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t, and I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn H, I am at y_H, and I want y_H =9, with minimal H.\n\nSince I start at t=0, y_0=0.\n\nAfter first action, at t=1, I am at y_1, and so on.\n\nI reach y=9 at some turn T, meaning after T turns, y_T=9.\n\ny_0=0, after one move, y_1 could be 0 or 1, etc.\n\nI need y_T=9 for some T, with minimal T.\n\nBut T is the turn number when I reach y=9.\n\nSince I start at t=0, y=0, and I want to be at y=9 at turn T.\n\nThe number of actions: from t=0 to t=T, I have T actions: a_0 to a_{T-1}, and y_T = y_0 + sum of Δy.\n\ny_0=0, y_T=9, so sum of Δy from t=0 to t=T-1 must be 9.\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1, so to minimize T, I should avoid going down or staying if possible, but I have to avoid collisions.\n\nCollision occurs when at turn t, I am on y_t between 1 and 8, and y_t is unsafe at time t.\n\ny_t is the freeway I am on at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, I am on y_t, and if 1≤ y_t ≤8 and unsafe for that y at time t, then collision.\n\nI need to ensure that for all t, if 1≤ y_t ≤8, then t is not in unsafe times for y_t.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, no issue when on them.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nThe unsafe times are periodic or something? Let's see the pattern.\n\nFor y=1 to 4, unsafe at t=0,1,8,9\n\nFor y=5 to 8, unsafe at t=2,3,8,9\n\nt=8 and 9 are unsafe for all freeways.\n\nNow, I start at t=0, y=0.\n\nAt t=0, I am on y=0, safe.\n\nI choose action a_0, which determines y_1.\n\ny_1 can be 0 (stay), 1 (up), or -1 (down), but y must be in [0,9], so down to -1 not possible, so a_0 can be S or U, y_1=0 or 1.\n\nIf I go up to y=1 at t=1, but at t=1, y=1 is unsafe for t=1? For y=1, unsafe at t=0,1,8,9.\n\nt=1 is unsafe for y=1.\n\nIf I am on y=1 at t=1, I collide.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay at y=0 at t=1, safe.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nPerhaps I should not go to y=1 at t=1.\n\nLet me think about the path.\n\nSince t=0 and t=1 are unsafe for lower freeways, and t=8,9 unsafe for all, I need to cross when safe.\n\nThe unsafe times are only at low t and t=8,9.\n\nFor example, for y=1 to 4, safe times are t=2,3,4,5,6,7 except t=8,9 unsafe.\n\nt=0,1 unsafe, t=2 to 7 safe? t=2 to 7 for y=1-4.\n\ny=1 unsafe at t=0,1,8,9, so safe for t=2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nSimilarly y=2,3,4 same.\n\nFor y=5-8, unsafe at t=2,3,8,9, so safe for t=0,1,4,5,6,7? Let's see:\n\ny=5 unsafe at t=2,3,8,9, so safe at t=0,1,4,5,6,7.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8.\n\nt=4,5,6,7 are safe for all freeways, since for y=1-4, t=4,5,6,7 safe, for y=5-8, t=4,5,6,7 safe.\n\nt=8 and 9 unsafe for all.\n\nt=0: for y=1-4 unsafe, but y=0 safe.\n\nt=1: similar.\n\nt=2: for y=1-4 safe, for y=5-8 unsafe.\n\nt=3: same.\n\nI need to reach y=9 by some time before t=8 or after, but t=8 and 9 unsafe, so if I am on freeway at t=8 or 9, collide, so I need to be on y=0 or y=9 at t=8 and t=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, y=0 safe.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should go up quickly during safe times.\n\nThe safe period for all is t=4,5,6,7.\n\nt=4 to 7 all freeways safe.\n\nt=0,1,2,3 have some unsafe, t=8,9 unsafe.\n\nI start at t=0, y=0.\n\nI can stay at y=0 for a while, or go up carefully.\n\nBut to minimize H, I should not stay if possible.\n\nH is the number of turns to reach y=9.\n\ny_T=9 at turn T.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 moves up, so T=9 if I go up every turn.\n\nBut let's see if possible.\n\nIf I go up every turn from t=0 to t=8, y_t = t for t=0 to 9? Let's see:\n\nAt t=0, y=0\n\nAfter a_0=U, y_1=1\n\nAt t=1, y=1, and for y=1, t=1 unsafe, collide. So not possible.\n\nIf I stay at t=0, a_0=S, y_1=0\n\nThen at t=1, if I go up, y_1=1, but t=1 unsafe for y=1, collide.\n\nIf I stay again, y_1=0, but I need to move up eventually.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=1 at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be on y=2,3,4 at t=0 or t=1, but t=0 I start at y=0.\n\ny=2 at t=0: but I start at y=0, so at t=0, I can only be on y=0 or if I move, but at t=0 I am at y=0.\n\nAt each turn, I am at a position before choosing action.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, then I choose a_t, then move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAt turn t, when I am at y_t, I might collide if on freeway and unsafe.\n\nFor example, at t=0, I am at y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nI choose a_0.\n\nIf a_0=S, y_1=0\n\nIf a_0=U, y_1=1\n\nThen at turn t=1, I am at y_1.\n\nIf y_1=0, safe.\n\nIf y_1=1, and t=1 unsafe for y=1, collide.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot have y_t=1 at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, for t=0, if I could be on y=1, but I start at y=0, so at t=0, I am on y=0, not y=1.\n\nSo the earliest I can be on y=1 is t=1, but t=1 unsafe for y=1, so I cannot be on y=1 at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be on y=2 at t=1, but at t=1, if I am on y=2, is it unsafe?\n\nFor y=2, unsafe at t=0,1,8,9, so t=1 unsafe, so if on y=2 at t=1, collide.\n\nSimilarly for y=3 and y=4 at t=1.\n\nAt t=0, I am only at y=0.\n\nSo at t=1, I can be at y=0 (if stayed) or y=1 (if up).\n\nBut y=1 at t=1 unsafe, so only safe option at t=1 is to be at y=0, meaning I must have stayed at t=0.\n\nSo a_0 must be S, so y_1=0.\n\nNow at t=1, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nI choose a_1.\n\nI can do S or U.\n\nIf S, y_2=0\n\nIf U, y_2=1\n\nNow at turn t=2, I am at y_2.\n\nIf y_2=0, safe.\n\nIf y_2=1, now for y=1, is t=2 unsafe? y=1 unsafe at t=0,1,8,9, t=2 is safe for y=1.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=2, for y=2, t=2 safe, since unsafe only 0,1,8,9.\n\nt=2 not in 0,1,8,9, so safe for y=1-4.\n\nBut for y=5-8, t=2 is unsafe.\n\nAt t=2, if I am on y=1, it is safe, since y=1 safe at t=2.\n\nSimilarly y=2,3,4 safe at t=2.\n\nBut y=5,6,7,8 unsafe at t=2.\n\nNow, from y=0 at t=1, I can go up to y=1 at t=2? Let's see the move.\n\nAt t=1, I am at y=0, I choose a_1.\n\nIf a_1=U, then y_2 = y_1 + Δy_1, y_1=0, Δy=+1, so y_2=1.\n\nThen at turn t=2, I am at y_2=1.\n\ny=1 at t=2 is safe, as above.\n\nIf I go to y=2, but from y=0, I can only go to y=1 directly, not to y=2 in one move.\n\ny_t changes by at most 1 per turn.\n\nSo from y=0, I can only reach y=1 next.\n\nAt t=1, y=0, a_1=U, y_2=1.\n\nAt t=2, I am at y=1, which is safe for t=2.\n\nThen I can go up to y=2 at t=3, or stay, etc.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nStart: t=0, y_0=0, safe (not freeway)\n\na_0 must be S to avoid being on freeway at t=1? At t=1, if I go up, I am on y=1 at t=1, which is unsafe.\n\nSo a_0=S, so y_1=0\n\nt=1, y_1=0, safe\n\nNow a_1: I can choose U or S.\n\nIf a_1=S, y_2=0\n\nBut I need to go up, so probably U.\n\na_1=U, so y_2=1\n\nNow at t=2, y_2=1\n\nIs it safe? y=1 at t=2: unsafe times t=0,1,8,9, t=2 not in, so safe.\n\nNow I need to go to higher y.\n\nI can go up to y=2.\n\na_2: U, so y_3 = y_2 +1 =1+1=2\n\nAt t=3, y_3=2\n\ny=2 at t=3: unsafe times same as y=1, t=0,1,8,9, t=3 safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue up.\n\na_3: U, y_4 =3\n\nt=4, y_4=3, safe.\n\na_4: U, y_5=4\n\nt=5, y_5=4\n\ny=4 at t=5: unsafe t=0,1,8,9, t=5 safe.\n\nNow y=4, I need to go to y=5.\n\nBut y=5 is freeway 5, which has unsafe times t=2,3,8,9.\n\nAt t=5, y=5, is it safe? t=5 not in 2,3,8,9, and since t=5 is in 4,5,6,7, safe for all, so yes.\n\na_5: U, y_6=5\n\nt=6, y_6=5, safe (t=6 safe)\n\na_6: U, y_7=6\n\nt=7, y_7=6, y=6 at t=7, safe.\n\na_7: U, y_8=7\n\nt=8, y_8=7\n\nNow at t=8, y=7, which is freeway, and t=8 is unsafe for all freeways, including y=7.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=8, so if I am on y=7 at t=8, collide.\n\nProblem.\n\ny_8=7 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nBut I reached y=7 at t=8.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some point.\n\nAt t=8, if I am on y=7, collide.\n\nI could have arrived earlier or later.\n\nIn this sequence, I went up slowly, but I started late.\n\nt=0: y=0\n\na0=S, y1=0\n\nt=1: y=0\n\na1=U, y2=1\n\nt=2: y=1\n\na2=U, y3=2\n\nt=3: y=2\n\na3=U, y4=3\n\nt=4: y=3\n\na4=U, y5=4\n\nt=5: y=4\n\na5=U, y6=5\n\nt=6: y=5\n\na6=U, y7=6\n\nt=7: y=6\n\na7=U, y8=7\n\nAt t=8, y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nIf at t=7, I go up to y=8 or something.\n\ny7=6, if a7=U, y8=7\n\nBut at t=8, y8=7 unsafe.\n\nIf a7=S, y8=6, then at t=8, y=6, which is also unsafe since t=8 unsafe for all.\n\nIf I go down, but y=5 might be safe? At t=8, y=5 unsafe.\n\nAll freeways unsafe at t=8.\n\nSo I cannot be on any freeway y=1 to 8 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nI need to be on y=0 or y=9 at t=8 and t=9.\n\ny=9 is the target.\n\nIn the sequence above, I am at y=6 at t=7.\n\nt=7, y=6, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 without being on freeway at t=8 or t=9.\n\nt=8 and t=9 are critical.\n\nSince t=4 to 7 are all safe, I could go faster.\n\nBut I started late because I stayed at t=0.\n\nAt t=0, I had to stay to avoid being on freeway at t=1.\n\nBut let's see if I can go up earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=1, I am at y=0.\n\nInstead of going up to y=1 at t=2, I could go directly to higher, but I can only move one step.\n\nAnother idea: I could go to y=5 directly, but I can't, must move step by step.\n\nPerhaps I can stay longer at lower y or something.\n\nSince t=2 and t=3 are safe for y=1-4, but unsafe for y=5-8.\n\nI am at y=0 at t=1.\n\nIf I go up to y=1 at t=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=2, y=1, I can go up to y=2 at t=3, safe.\n\nAt t=3, y=2, go up to y=3 at t=4, and so on.\n\nBut from t=4 to t=7, I can go up quickly.\n\nLet's list the turns:\n\nt | y_t | action a_{t-1} or something.\n\nSet the turn and position.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nt=0: y_0=0\n\nNow, to avoid being on freeway at t=1, I must have y_1=0, so a_0=S\n\nt=1: y_1=0\n\nNow at t=1, I can choose to go up or stay.\n\nIf I go up, a_1=U, y_2=1\n\nt=2: y_2=1, safe as above.\n\nThen a_2=U, y_3=2\n\nt=3: y_3=2, safe (y=2 safe at t=3)\n\na_3=U, y_4=3\n\nt=4: y_4=3, safe\n\na_4=U, y_5=4\n\nt=5: y_5=4, safe\n\nNow y=4 at t=5.\n\nI need to go to y=5, but y=5 is freeway 5.\n\nAt t=5, if I go to y=5, y_6=5\n\nt=6: y_6=5, which is safe since t=6 not unsafe for y=5.\n\nSimilarly, a_6=U, y_7=6\n\nt=7: y_7=6, safe\n\na_7=U, y_8=7\n\nt=8: y_8=7, but t=8 unsafe for y=7, collide.\n\nSame problem.\n\nAt t=7, y_7=6, if I go up to y=7, y_8=7 at t=8 unsafe.\n\nIf I go up to y=8, but from y=6, I can only go to y=7.\n\ny_7=6, a_7=U, y_8=7\n\nNo choice.\n\nUnless I reach higher earlier.\n\nBut I started from y=0 at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, y=0, I could go up to y=1 at t=2, but that's the earliest.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at some point to delay.\n\nFor example, at t=5, y_5=4, I could stay, a_5=S, y_6=4\n\nt=6: y_6=4, safe\n\nThen a_6=U, y_7=5\n\nt=7: y_7=5, safe\n\nThen a_7=U, y_8=6\n\nt=8: y_8=6, unsafe, collide.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr at t=7, y_7=5, a_7=U, y_8=6 at t=8 unsafe.\n\nStill on freeway at t=8.\n\nTo avoid being on freeway at t=8, I need to be on y=0 or y=9 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly for t=9.\n\nSince I am at y=4 at t=5, I need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=4 to y=9, I need at least 5 moves: to y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut at t=5, y=4.\n\nIf I go up each turn:\n\na_5=U, y_6=5 at t=6\n\na_6=U, y_7=6 at t=7\n\na_7=U, y_8=7 at t=8 → unsafe\n\ny_8=7 at t=8 collide.\n\nIf I go faster, but I can't, because from t=5, I start from y=4.\n\nUnless I can be at higher y at earlier t.\n\nBut at t=1, I am at y=0, and I can only reach y=1 at t=2.\n\nLet's see the earliest I can be at each y.\n\nAt t=0, y=0\n\nt=1, y=0 or 1, but y=1 at t=1 unsafe, so only y=0 at t=1.\n\nt=2, y can be 0 (if stayed at t=1), or 1 (if up at t=1 from y=0)\n\nBut y=0 at t=2 is safe, y=1 at t=2 is safe.\n\nTo go up, I should go to y=1 at t=2.\n\nThen t=3, y can be 1 (stay), or 2 (up from y=1)\n\nBoth safe at t=3 for y=1 or 2.\n\nGo to y=2.\n\nSimilarly, t=4, y=3\n\nt=5, y=4\n\nNow from here, to reach y=9, I need to go to y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut when I reach y=8, for example.\n\nSuppose at t=6, y=5\n\nt=7, y=6\n\nt=8, y=7 or 8 or something.\n\nBut at t=8, if y=7 or 8, both freeway, unsafe.\n\nIf I can be at y=8 at t=7, but at t=7, I am at y=6 as above, can only go to y=7.\n\nMaximum I can be at t=7 is y=7, if I went faster.\n\nCan I be at y=7 at t=7?\n\nLet's see the sequence from start.\n\nt=0: y=0, a0=S, y1=0\n\nt=1: y=0, a1=U, y2=1\n\nt=2: y=1, a2=U, y3=2\n\nt=3: y=2, a3=U, y4=3\n\nt=4: y=3, a4=U, y5=4\n\nt=5: y=4, a5=U, y6=5\n\nt=6: y=5, a6=U, y7=6\n\nt=7: y=6, a7=U, y8=7\n\nt=8: y=7, collide.\n\nAt t=5, y=4, if I do not go up, but stay or something, but I need to go up.\n\nAnother idea: since t=4 to 7 are safe, I can go up faster by not staying, but I already went up as fast as possible from t=1.\n\nBut at t=1, I was at y=0, so I lost a turn.\n\nPerhaps I can go to the upper freeways earlier when they are safe.\n\nFor example, for y=5 to 8, they are safe at t=0,1,4,5,6,7.\n\nBut at t=0, I am at y=0, not on y=5.\n\nAt t=1, I am at y=0 or if I could be at y=5, but I can't.\n\nThe only way to be on y=5 at t=1 is if I started there or moved, but I start at y=0.\n\nSo impossible to be on high y at low t.\n\nSo I have to go through the freeways step by step.\n\nTo avoid being on freeway at t=8, I need to reach y=9 by t=7 or earlier, or after t=9, but after t=9 might take longer.\n\ny=9 at t=7: from y=0 to y=9 in 7 turns? Minimum moves: from t=0 to t=7, 7 actions, y_7 could be from 0 to 7, max y=7 at t=7.\n\ny_t <= t, since start at 0.\n\nAt turn t, y_t <= t.\n\nTo have y_t =9, t at least 9.\n\nAt t=9, y=9 is possible.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, I cannot be on freeway, so if I reach y=9 at t=9, at t=9 I am on y=9, which is safe, not freeway.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, I need to be on y=0 or y=8 or something, but y=8 is freeway, unsafe at t=8, so I need to be on y=0 or y=9 at t=8.\n\nIf I reach y=9 at t=9, at t=8 I might be on y=8, which is freeway, unsafe at t=8.\n\nSo I need to be on y=9 at t=8 or earlier, but earlier not possible, min t=9 for y=9.\n\ny_9=9 at earliest.\n\nAt t=8, y_8 must be 0 or 9.\n\nBut y_8=9 only if I reached earlier, impossible, so y_8 must be 0.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, y_9 must be 9.\n\nSo I need to be at y=0 at t=8, and then go to y=9 at t=9.\n\nBut y=0 at t=8, then a8=U, y9=1, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9, from y=0 at t=8, I need multiple moves.\n\nLet's think.\n\nI need to have a sequence where at t=8, I am on y=0 or y=9.\n\nSince y=9 impossible at t=8, I must be on y=0 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, y=0, safe.\n\nThen I can go up, but to reach y=9, I need 9 moves from there, which takes to t=17, too long, not minimal.\n\nSo better to reach y=9 at t=9, but at t=8, I need to be on y=9 or y=0.\n\nIf I reach y=9 at t=9, at t=8 I am at y=8, which is freeway, and t=8 unsafe, so I collide at t=8.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to reach y=9 without being on a freeway at some unsafe time, but I need to arrange so that at t=8 and t=9, I am not on freeway.\n\nThe only way is to be on y=0 or y=9 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nBut to be on y=9 at t=9, I must have been on y=8 at t=8, which is freeway, unsafe at t=8.\n\nContradiction.\n\nUnless I can be on y=9 at t=8, but impossible since y_t <= t, y_8 <=8 <9.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=9 before t=9.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is to be on y=0 at t=8 and at t=9, but at t=9 I can be on y=9.\n\nBut if I am on y=0 at t=8, and I want to be on y=9 at t=9, I need to go from 0 to 9 in one move, impossible, Δy max 1.\n\nSo I cannot reach y=9 at t=9 from y=0 at t=8.\n\nThe best I can do is to be on y=8 at t=8, but unsafe, or on y=0 at t=8, then reach y=9 later.\n\nFor example, at t=8, y=0, safe.\n\nThen I can start going up, but t=9 is also unsafe for freeways, so I need to avoid freeways at t=9 as well.\n\nt=9 unsafe for all freeways.\n\nSo at t=9, I need to be on y=0 or y=9.\n\nSimilarly for t=8.\n\nSo to reach y=9, I must be on y=9 at t=9 or later.\n\nBut at t=9, if I am on y=9, safe.\n\nAt t=8, I must be on y=0 or y=9.\n\nSince y=9 impossible, must be on y=0 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, y=0, a8=U, y9=1\n\nAt t=9, y9=1, which is freeway, and t=9 unsafe, so collide at t=9.\n\nIf a8=S, y9=0, then at t=9, y=0, safe, but not at 9.\n\nThen I can go up later, but it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, after t=9, the unsafe times are only up to t=9, for t>=10, let's see if there are unsafe times.\n\nFor example, for y=1, unsafe at t=0,1,8,9, so for t=10, is it safe?\n\nFor car on y=1, first car: at T, span [-59+6T, -48+6T], 0 in it when T=8,9 as before.\n\nFor T=10, -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSecond car: [-11+6T, 6T], at T=10, [-11+60,60]= [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo for t=10, y=1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, the unsafe times are only low t and t=8,9.\n\nFor example, y=5, unsafe at t=2,3,8,9, so t=10 safe.\n\nSo after t=9, for t>=10, all freeways are safe, no cars cover 0.\n\nBecause the cars are moving away or something.\n\nFor example, the cars on y=1, at t=10, positions like [1,12] and [49,60], both positive, so for x=0, not covered.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nSo for t>=10, all freeways are safe.\n\nTherefore, I can cross the freeways after t=9 without problem.\n\nBut to minimize H, I should reach as soon as possible.\n\nSince at t=8 and t=9, I need to be on y=0 to avoid collision.\n\nThen after that, I can go up directly.\n\nBut I need to be at y=0 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=8, y=0, and at t=9, if I stay, y=0, then go up.\n\nBut at t=9, if I am on y=0, safe, then I can start going up.\n\nNow, from y=0 at t=9, to y=9, I need 9 moves, so at t=18, y=9.\n\nBut I can be at higher y before t=8.\n\nFor example, I can be at y=4 at t=5, as before.\n\nThen instead of going up at t=5,6,7, I can stay or go down to be at y=0 at t=8.\n\nBut going down might not help.\n\nLet's see the sequence to be at y=0 at t=8.\n\nFrom start, at t=0, y=0\n\na0=S, y1=0\n\nt=1, y1=0, a1=S, y2=0? Or U to y=1 at t=2.\n\nBut I need to be at y=0 at t=8.\n\nI can go up to some point and then come down.\n\nBut coming down might waste turns.\n\nTo minimize H, I should be as high as possible before t=8, so that after t=9, I have less to go.\n\nBut at t=8, I must be at y=0.\n\nSimilarly at t=9, I must be at y=0 or go to y=9, but y=9 only at t=9 or later.\n\nSince I am at y=0 at t=8, at t=9 I can be at y=1 or y=0.\n\nBut if I go to y=1 at t=9, it is unsafe, so I must stay at y=0 at t=9 as well.\n\nSo at both t=8 and t=9, I am at y=0.\n\nThen at t=9, I choose a9=U, y10=1\n\nSince t=10, y=1 is safe, as above.\n\nThen I can go up each turn to y=9 at t=18.\n\nBut that is 18 turns, probably not minimal.\n\nI could be at a higher y at t=7, for example.\n\nAt t=7, I can be at y=7, as in the first sequence.\n\ny=7 at t=7, safe.\n\nBut at t=8, I need to be at y=0, so from y=7 at t=7, I need to go down to y=0 in one move? Impossible, Δy=-1, so y8=6 if a7=D.\n\nThen at t=8, y=6, which is freeway, unsafe, collide.\n\nIf I go down multiple times.\n\nFor example, from t=7, y=7, if I go down, a7=D, y8=6\n\nBut at t=8, y=6, unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nTo be at low y at t=8, I need to be low earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=5, I was at y=4.\n\nIf at t=5, y=4, I stay, a5=S, y6=4\n\nt=6, y=4, a6=S, y7=4\n\nt=7, y=4, a7=D, y8=3? But y=3 at t=8 is freeway, unsafe.\n\na7=S, y8=4, still on freeway, unsafe.\n\na7=D, y8=3, unsafe.\n\nAll not good.\n\nI need to be at y=0 at t=8.\n\nSo from t=5, y=4, I need to go down to y=0.\n\nBut each down move takes one turn, and at each turn, when I am on freeway, it must be safe time.\n\nFor example, from t=5, y=4, which is freeway 4, unsafe at t=0,1,8,9, but t=5 safe, so ok.\n\na5=D, y6=3\n\nt=6, y=3, freeway 3, unsafe at t=0,1,8,9, t=6 safe.\n\na6=D, y7=2\n\nt=7, y=2, freeway 2, t=7 safe.\n\na7=D, y8=1\n\nAt t=8, y=1, but y=1 at t=8 unsafe, collide.\n\na7=D to y8=1 at t=8 unsafe.\n\nIf at t=7, y=2, I go down to y=1, but at t=8, y=1 unsafe.\n\nOr I can stay at y=2 at t=7, a7=S, y8=2, but at t=8, y=2 unsafe.\n\nSame.\n\nTo avoid, I need to be at y=0 before t=8.\n\nFor example, at t=7, I need to be at y=0 or y=1, but if y=1 at t=7, safe, then a7=D to y8=0, but a7=D from y=1, y8=0.\n\nAt t=8, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, y=0, I can stay or go up.\n\nBut at t=9, I need to be on y=0 or y=9.\n\nIf I go up, y9=1, at t=9 y=1 unsafe.\n\nSo I must stay at t=8, a8=S, y9=0\n\nThen at t=9, y=0, safe.\n\nThen after that, I can go up.\n\nBut at t=9, y=0, a9=U, y10=1, and so on to y18=9.\n\nStill 18 turns.\n\nBut I can be at higher y at t=7.\n\nFor example, in the sequence, at t=7, I can be at y=7.\n\nBut from y=7 to y=0, I need to go down 7 times, which takes 7 turns, and during that, I may be on freeway at unsafe times.\n\nFor example, start from t=7, y=7.\n\na7=D, y8=6, but at t=8, y=6 unsafe, collide immediately.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo down earlier.\n\nSuppose at t=4, I am at y=4, safe.\n\nInstead of going up, I go down.\n\na4=D, y5=3\n\nt=5, y=3, safe (t=5 safe for y=3)\n\na5=D, y6=2\n\nt=6, y=2, safe\n\na6=D, y7=1\n\nt=7, y=1, safe (t=7 safe for y=1)\n\na7=D, y8=0\n\nt=8, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, a8=S, y9=0 (must, because if U, y9=1 at t=9 unsafe)\n\na8=S, y9=0\n\nt=9, y=0, a9=U, y10=1\n\nThen go up each turn: a10=U, y11=2, ..., up to a17=U, y18=9.\n\nSo at turn t=18, y=9.\n\nBut this is 18 turns from start, with many down moves.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nTo reach faster, I should be as high as possible when I can, before t=8.\n\nFor example, at t=7, I can be at y=7, as before.\n\nThen at t=7, y=7, I cannot go down because of t=8.\n\nBut t=8 is the problem.\n\nAnother idea: since for y=5-8, they are safe at t=0,1, but I can't be there.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=4 at t=4, then stay there until after t=9.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, if I am on y=4, it is unsafe for t=8,9.\n\nSo I must not be on freeway at t=8,9.\n\nSo I have to be on y=0 or y=9 at those times.\n\ny=9 not possible, so only y=0.\n\nSo I must be on y=0 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nThen after t=9, I can go up freely.\n\nThe quickest way is to go up to some point before t=8, then go down to y=0 at t=8.\n\nBut going down takes time and may not save turns.\n\nFor example, if I go up to y=k at t=k for k from 0 to 7, but at t=7, y=7.\n\nThen from y=7 at t=7 to y=0 at t=8, impossible.\n\nGo up to y=4 at t=4, then go down to y=0 at t=8.\n\nFrom t=4, y=4, to t=8 y=0, I need 4 down moves in 4 turns.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=4: y=4\n\na4=D, y5=3\n\nt=5: y=3\n\na5=D, y6=2\n\nt=6: y=2\n\na6=D, y7=1\n\nt=7: y=1\n\na7=D, y8=0\n\nt=8: y=0\n\nThen a8=S, y9=0\n\nt=9: y=0\n\na9=U, y10=1\n\na10=U, y11=2\n\n...\n\nup to a17=U, y18=9\n\nStill 18 turns.\n\nBut I can reduce by not going up to y=7.\n\nFor example, at t=1, y=0, I can go up to y=1 at t=2.\n\nBut instead, I can stay at y=0 longer.\n\nBut that doesn't help.\n\nPerhaps at some point I can go up to y=5 or 6 when safe, but still need to come down.\n\nLet's calculate the minimal H.\n\nSince I must spend t=8 and t=9 at y=0, and I start from y=0 at t=0, but at t=0 I am at y=0, but I need to be at y=0 at t=8 and t=9, so I can stay at y=0 from t=0 to t=9, but then at t=9, y=0, then go up to y=9 at t=18, same as above.\n\nBut I can move up during safe times before.\n\nFor example, from t=2 to t=7, I can go up to y=5 or 6.\n\nThen at t=7, I am at y=5, say.\n\nThen I need to go down to y=0 at t=8, impossible.\n\nFrom y=5 at t=7 to y=0 at t=8, can only reach y=4 at t=8 if down, but y=4 at t=8 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo the only way is to be at y=0 at t=7 or earlier and stay.\n\nFor example, be at y=0 at t=7.\n\nHow?\n\nFrom start, t=0 y=0, a0=S, y1=0\n\nt=1 y=0, a1=S, y2=0\n\nBut at t=2, I can go up to y=1, safe.\n\nIf I want to be at y=0 at t=7, I need to stay or come back.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=0 y=0, a0=S, y1=0\n\nt=1 y=0, a1=S, y2=0\n\nt=2 y=0, a2=U, y3=1\n\nt=3 y=1, a3=U, y4=2\n\nt=4 y=2, a4=U, y5=3\n\nt=5 y=3, a5=U, y6=4\n\nt=6 y=4, a6=D, y7=3? But at t=7, y=3, not 0.\n\nTo be at y=0 at t=7, from t=6 y=4, I need to go down, but in one move to y=3, not 0.\n\nSo it takes multiple turns to go down.\n\nFor example, at t=4, y=4, I go down: a4=D, y5=3\n\na5=D, y6=2\n\na6=D, y7=1\n\nt=7 y=1\n\nThen a7=D, y8=0\n\nt=8 y=0\n\nSame as before.\n\nI think it's impossible to avoid the 18 turns with this approach.\n\nBut there must be a better way.\n\nLet's list all unsafe times again.\n\nPerhaps I missed that for some freeways, at some times it is safe to be there.\n\nAnother idea: I can be on a freeway at t=8 or t=9 if for that freeway at that time, no car covers 0, but for all freeways, at t=8 and t=9, there is a car covering 0.\n\nFor example, for y=1 at t=8: car A: at T=8, span [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nCar B: at T=8, [-11+48, 48] = [37,48], 0 not in, but car A has 0.\n\nSimilarly for other y, at t=8 and t=9, all have cars covering 0.\n\nSo no, I cannot be on any freeway at t=8 or t=9.\n\nSo I must be on y=0 or y=9.\n\nSince y=9 not possible at t=8 or t=9 except t=9 for y=9, but at t=8 I need to be on y=8 for that, which is unsafe.\n\nSo the only safe way is to be on y=0 at t=8 and t=9, then go up after.\n\nBut to minimize H, I should reach as high as possible before t=8 without being on freeway at t=8,9.\n\nBut before t=8, I can be on freeway at safe times.\n\nFor example, at t=7, I can be at y=7, which is safe.\n\nThen from t=9 onwards, I start from y=0, but I was at y=7 at t=7, then I have to go down to y=0 at t=8, which is not possible without colliding at t=8.\n\nUnless I go down before t=8.\n\nFor example, at t=7, y=7, I can go down to y=6, but at t=8, y=6 if I stay or something, but at t=8 unsafe.\n\nSo I need to be at y=0 before t=8.\n\nLet's assume that at t=7, I am at y=k, then at t=8, I can be at k-1, k, or k+1, but must be 0 for safety.\n\nSo k-1=0 or k=0 or k+1=0, so k=1 or k=0 or k=-1 impossible, so k=0 or k=1.\n\nIf k=0, then at t=7, y=0, a7=S or U, but if U, y8=1 unsafe, so a7=S, y8=0.\n\nIf k=1, at t=7, y=1, a7=D, y8=0.\n\nThen at t=8, y=0.\n\nSimilarly for t=9.\n\nBut at t=7, if I am at y=1, I can go down to y=0 at t=8.\n\nOr if at y=0, stay.\n\nBut at t=7, I can be at y=1 or higher.\n\nFor example, to be at y=1 at t=7.\n\nHow to get there.\n\nFrom start:\n\nt=0: y0=0, a0=S, y1=0\n\nt=1: y1=0, a1=U, y2=1  (since at t=2, y=1 safe)\n\nt=2: y2=1, a2=U, y3=2\n\nt=3: y3=2, a3=U, y4=3\n\nt=4: y4=3, a4=U, y5=4\n\nt=5: y5=4, a5=U, y6=5\n\nt=6: y6=5, a6=U, y7=6  (y=6 at t=7? t=6: y=5, a6=U, y7=6)\n\nAt t=7, y7=6\n\nBut I want to be at y=1 at t=7.\n\nSo I need to go down from some point.\n\nFor example, at t=6, I am at y=5, if I go down, a6=D, y7=4\n\nNot 1.\n\nTo be at low y, I need to have gone down earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=4, y=4, I go down: a4=D, y5=3\n\na5=D, y6=2\n\na6=D, y7=1\n\nThen at t=7, y7=1\n\nThen a7=D, y8=0\n\nt=8, y8=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, a8=S, y9=0 (because if U, y9=1 at t=9 unsafe)\n\na8=S, y9=0\n\nt=9, y9=0, a9=U, y10=1\n\na10=U, y11=2\n\na11=U, y12=3\n\na12=U, y13=4\n\na13=U, y14=5\n\na14=U, y15=6\n\na15=U, y16=7\n\na16=U, y17=8\n\na17=U, y18=9\n\nSo at turn t=18, y=9, with 18 actions.\n\nBut this is not minimal, because I wasted turns going down.\n\nIn this sequence, I went up to y=4 at t=4, then down to y=1 at t=7, then to y=0 at t=8, then stayed at 0 for t=9, then up.\n\nTotal turns to reach y=9 is 18.\n\nBut I could have stayed at y=4 from t=4 to t=7, then down, but same thing.\n\nOr, at t=4, y=4, I can stay until t=7, a4=S, y5=4, a5=S, y6=4, a6=S, y7=4, then a7=D, y8=3, but at t=8, y=3 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo the above sequence seems necessary to be at y=0 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach y=9 faster by being at higher y after t=9.\n\nFor example, if at t=7, I am at y=7, then after t=9, I start from y=0, but I was at y=7, so I lost that progress.\n\nBut I can't be at high y at t=7 and at y=0 at t=8.\n\nSo the trade-off is to be at a medium height at t=7, so that going down to y=1 or something is quick.\n\nIn the sequence above, I was at y=4 at t=4, then down to y=1 at t=7 in 3 turns.\n\nFrom y=4 to y=1, down 3 steps in 3 turns.\n\nThen from y=1 at t=7 to y=0 at t=8 in one turn.\n\nThen after, from y=0 at t=9 to y=9 at t=18.\n\nBut from t=9 to t=18 is 9 turns, total from start 18.\n\nThe down moves from t=4 to t7 are 3 turns, but I could have used those to go up.\n\nFor example, if I go up from t=4 to t=7, I can be at y=7 at t=7, then I have to go down later, but I can't because of t=8.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=9 at t=9 by being on y=8 at t=8, but it is unsafe, so not possible.\n\nUnless for some freeway at t=8, it is safe, but it's not.\n\nAnother thought: the collision only happens if I am on the freeway at the turn when 0 is covered, but if I move away at the same turn, but the note says that if I move to a different y at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so at turn T, I am on y_T, and I collide if cars on y_T cover 0 at T.\n\nWhen I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose action to go to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I am on y_T.\n\nSo I can't avoid by moving away at the same turn.\n\nSo I think the only way is to avoid being on freeway at t=8 and t=9.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 18, with the sequence like above.\n\nBut let's confirm with the car states.\n\nPerhaps for some freeways, the cars do not cover 0 at t=8 or t=9 for all, but from earlier, for y=1 at t=8, car A: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nFor y=5 at t=8, cars: first car (-48,-59,right,6) at T=8: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nSecond car (-12,-23,right,6) at T=8: [-23+48, -12+48] = [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nThird car (24,13,right,6) at T=8: [13+48,24+48]=[61,72], 0 not in.\n\nBut first car has 0, so unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for all, so yes.\n\nSo I think 18 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach earlier by crossing after t=9.\n\nFor example, at t=9, I am at y=0, then I can go up each turn to y=9 at t=18.\n\nBut if I can be at higher y at t=9, but at t=9, I must be at y=0 to avoid collision, so I can't be higher.\n\nSo y=0 at t=9.\n\nThen go up.\n\nMinimal H is 18.\n\nBut perhaps I can start going up after t=1.\n\nLet's list the sequence of actions.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0\n\na0 = S  (so that at t=1, y=0, not on freeway)\n\nt=1, y=0\n\na1 = U  (go to y=1 at t=2)\n\nt=2, y=1\n\na2 = U  (y=2 at t=3)\n\nt=3, y=2\n\na3 = U  (y=3 at t=4)\n\nt=4, y=3\n\na4 = U  (y=4 at t=5)\n\nt=5, y=4\n\nNow, instead of going up, I go down to reach y=1 at t=7.\n\na5 = D  (y=3 at t=6)\n\nt=6, y=3\n\na6 = D  (y=2 at t=7)\n\nt=7, y=2? I want y=1 at t=7.\n\nMistake.\n\nt=5, y=4\n\na5=D, y6=3\n\nt=6, y=3\n\na6=D, y7=2\n\nt=7, y=2\n\nBut I need y=1 at t=7 for the down to 0.\n\nSo from here, a7=D, y8=1, but at t=8, y=1 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nTo be at y=1 at t=7:\n\nFrom t=5, y=4, a5=D, y6=3\n\nt=6, y=3, a6=D, y7=2\n\nt=7, y=2\n\nThen to reach y=1, a7=D, y8=1, unsafe.\n\nSo I need to be at y=1 earlier.\n\nSet at t=4, y=4\n\na4=D, y5=3\n\nt=5, y=3, a5=D, y6=2\n\nt=6, y=2, a6=D, y7=1\n\nt=7, y=1\n\nThen a7=D, y8=0\n\nt=8, y=0\n\na8=S, y9=0\n\nt=9, y=0\n\na9=U, y10=1\n\na10=U, y11=2\n\na11=U, y12=3\n\na12=U, y13=4\n\na13=U, y14=5\n\na14=U, y15=6\n\na15=U, y16=7\n\na16=U, y17=8\n\na17=U, y18=9\n\nYes, at turn t=18, y=9.\n\nThe actions are from a0 to a17, 18 actions, reach at turn 18.\n\nBut is there a way with less?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=1 at t=7 with less moves, but from start to t=4, I went up to y=4 in 4 turns (from t=0 to t=4, y from 0 to 4, 4 up moves).\n\nThen from t=4 to t=7, I go down to y=1 in 3 down moves.\n\nTotal to t=7, I have position y=1, but I used 7 turns to be at y=1, whereas I could be at y=7 in 7 turns, so I lost 6 levels.\n\nThen from t=7 to t=18, I go up to y=9, from y=1 to y=9, 8 up moves, from t=9 to t=17, 8 turns, y from 1 to 9.\n\nt=9 y=0, t=10 y=1, ..., t=17 y=8, t=18 y=9.\n\nSo 9 turns from y=0 to y=9.\n\nBut since I was at y=1 at t=7, but I had to go to y=0 at t=8 and t=9, so I lost that.\n\nNo better.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=8 at some point, but at t=8 it is unsafe, so I can't.\n\nI think 18 is the best.\n\nBut let's check the car states again.\n\nPerhaps for freeways 5-8, at t=0 and t=1, they are safe, but I can't be there.\n\nOr perhaps I can be on y=5 at t=1, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: at t=0, I am at y=0, safe.\n\na0=U, but if a0=U, y1=1, at t=1, y=1, which is unsafe, collide. So I cannot.\n\nSo I must a0=S.\n\nSimilarly, no choice.\n\nSo I think the minimal number of turns is 18.\n\nBut let's confirm the action sequence.\n\nTurn t=0: action S\n\nTurn t=1: action U  (to go to y=1 at t=2)\n\nAt t=1, I am at y=0, choose a1=U, so y2=1.\n\nThen turn t=2: action U, y3=2\n\nTurn t=3: action U, y4=3\n\nTurn t=4: action D, y5=3? Let's list actions and resulting y.\n\nDefine the action at turn t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nFor the sequence:\n\nAt t=0: y0=0, choose a0=S, so y1=0\n\nt=1: y1=0, choose a1=U, so y2=1\n\nt=2: y2=1, choose a2=U, so y3=2\n\nt=3: y3=2, choose a3=U, so y4=3\n\nt=4: y4=3, choose a4=U, so y5=4\n\nt=5: y5=4, choose a5=D, so y6=3\n\nt=6: y6=3, choose a6=D, so y7=2\n\nt=7: y7=2, choose a7=D, so y8=1? But I want to go to y=0.\n\na7=D, from y=2, y8=1\n\nThen at t=8, y8=1, which is unsafe, collide.\n\nMistake in sequence.\n\nTo have y8=0, at t=7, I need y7=0 or 1.\n\nIf y7=0, a7=S or U, but if U, y8=1 unsafe, so a7=S, y8=0.\n\nIf y7=1, a7=D, y8=0.\n\nSo in the sequence, at t=7, I need y7=1.\n\nSo from above:\n\nt=5: y5=4\n\na5=D, y6=3\n\nt=6: y6=3\n\na6=D, y7=2  -- but I need y7=1, so here y7=2, not 1.\n\nSo at t=6, y=3, a6=D, y7=2\n\nThen to have y7=1, I need to go down from here, but at t=7, I am at y=2, not 1.\n\nSo I need to be at y=1 at t=7.\n\nFrom t=4, y=4, a4=D, y5=3\n\nt=5: y5=3, a5=D, y6=2\n\nt=6: y6=2, a6=D, y7=1\n\nt=7: y7=1, choose a7=D, so y8=0\n\nt=8: y8=0, choose a8=S, so y9=0 (must, to avoid being on freeway at t=9)\n\nt=9: y9=0, choose a9=U, so y10=1\n\nt=10: y10=1, a10=U, y11=2\n\nt=11: y11=2, a11=U, y12=3\n\nt=12: y12=3, a12=U, y13=4\n\nt=13: y13=4, a13=U, y14=5\n\nt=14: y14=5, a14=U, y15=6\n\nt=15: y15=6, a15=U, y16=7\n\nt=16: y16=7, a16=U, y17=8\n\nt=17: y17=8, a17=U, y18=9\n\nSo at turn t=18, y=9.\n\nActions from a0 to a17.\n\nH=18 turns.\n\nThe sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nIn the sequence, from turn 4 to turn 7, I went down, but turn 4 action is U to go to y=5? Let's list the actions with turn.\n\nThe action at turn t is for the move to position at t+1.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} for t_1=0.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 0: a0 = S\n\nTurn 1: a1 = U\n\nTurn 2: a2 = U\n\nTurn 3: a3 = U\n\nTurn 4: a4 = U  (at t=4, from y4=3 to y5=4)\n\nThen turn 5: a5 = D (from y5=4 to y6=3)\n\nTurn 6: a6 = D (y6=3 to y7=2)\n\nTurn 7: a7 = D (y7=2 to y8=1? No:\n\nAt t=6, y6=3, a6=D, so y7=2\n\nThen at t=7, y7=2, a7=D, y8=1\n\nBut I need y8=0, so from y7=2, a7=D, y8=1, not 0.\n\nTo have y8=0, from y7=2, I can only go to y8=1,2, or 3, not 0.\n\nSo I need y7=1 to go to y8=0 with D.\n\nSo in the sequence, at t=6, I need y6=2 to go down to y7=1.\n\nSo let's correct:\n\nFrom t=4: y4=3\n\na4=D, so y5=2  (not 3, because from y4=3, down to y5=2)\n\nt=5: y5=2, a5=D, y6=1\n\nt=6: y6=1, a6=D, y7=0? a6=D from y6=1, y7=0\n\nThen at t=7, y7=0, then a7 must be S or U.\n\nIf U, y8=1, unsafe at t=8.\n\nSo a7=S, y8=0\n\nt=8: y8=0, a8=S, y9=0\n\nt=9: y9=0, a9=U, y10=1\n\netc.\n\nBut at t=7, y7=0, which is good for t=7, but I could have been higher.\n\nIn this case, from t=4, I went down from y=3 to y=2 at t=5, then to y=1 at t=6, then to y=0 at t=7.\n\nThen stayed at 0 for t=8 and t=9.\n\nThen up.\n\nBut from t=0 to t=4, I went up to y=3 at t=4.\n\ny at t=4 is 3.\n\nThen down to y=0 at t=7.\n\nThen from t=9 to t=18 to y=9.\n\nt=9 y=0, t=10 y=1, ..., t=18 y=9, 9 turns.\n\nTotal turns: from t=0 to t=18, 18 turns.\n\nBut at t=4, y=3, I could have gone up to y=4 at t=5, but then I have to go down more.\n\nFor example, t=4 y=3, a4=U, y5=4\n\nt=5 y=4, a5=D, y6=3\n\nt=6 y=3, a6=D, y7=2\n\nt=7 y=2, then a7=D, y8=1 unsafe.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo the sequence with a4=D from y=3 to y=2 is better because I reach y=0 earlier.\n\nBut still H=18.\n\nI think this is the minimal.\n\nSo for the answer, H=18, with the action sequence as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, let's list the actions clearly.\n\nActions at each turn:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: D  (from y=3 to y=2 at t=5)\n\nTurn 5: D  (y=2 to y=1 at t=6)\n\nTurn 6: D  (y=1 to y=0 at t=7)\n\nTurn 7: S  (y=0 to y=0 at t=8)\n\nTurn 8: S  (y=0 to y=0 at t=9)\n\nTurn 9: U  (y=0 to y=1 at t=10)\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U  (to y=9 at t=18)\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 6: a6=D, from y=1 at t=6 to y=0 at t=7\n\nThen turn 7: a7=S, from y=0 to y=0 at t=8\n\nTurn 8: a8=S, from y=0 to y=0 at t=9\n\nTurn 9: a9=U, to y=1 at t=10\n\nThen turns 10 to 17: U each, to y=9 at t=18.\n\nH=18 turns.\n\nBut at turn 7, a7=S, and turn 8 a8=S, I stayed two turns at y=0.\n\nBut it's necessary to avoid t=8 and t=9 on freeway.\n\nSo I think this is the solution.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) in minimal turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, the player must account for the unsafe times on each freeway, where a collision occurs if the player is on the freeway at a turn when a car's span includes x=0.\n\nThe unsafe times for each freeway are:\n- Freeways y=1 to y=4: Unsafe at turns 0, 1, 8, 9\n- Freeways y=5 to y=8: Unsafe at turns 2, 3, 8, 9\n\nAll freeways are unsafe at turns 8 and 9, so the player must be on y=0 or y=9 at these turns. Since y=9 cannot be reached before turn 9 (as y_t ≤ t), the player must be on y=0 at turns 8 and 9. After turn 9, all freeways are safe for t ≥ 10.\n\nThe minimal sequence involves:\n- Moving up during safe times before turn 8 to maximize progress.\n- Descending to y=0 by turn 7 to avoid being on a freeway at turns 8 and 9.\n- Staying at y=0 at turns 8 and 9.\n- Moving up directly to y=9 after turn 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed to:\n- Start at y=0 at turn 0.\n- Move up to y=3 by turn 4 using actions U at turns 1, 2, 3, and 4 (y reaches 1 at turn 2, 2 at turn 3, 3 at turn 4).\n- Descend to y=0 by turn 7 using actions D at turns 4, 5, and 6 (y goes from 3 to 2 at turn 5, to 1 at turn 6, to 0 at turn 7).\n- Stay at y=0 at turns 8 and 9 with actions S at turns 7 and 8.\n- Move up to y=9 from turn 9 onwards with actions U at turns 9 to 17 (y reaches 1 at turn 10, 2 at turn 11, ..., 9 at turn 18).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player is never on a freeway during unsafe times and reaches y=9 in 18 turns, which is minimal given the constraints.\n\n**Action Sequence (H = 18 turns):**\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 1, and I'm at y=0. I have to move to y=9, which is the top row, I think, since y=0 to y=9.\n\nFirst, understand the car movements. All cars are moving right with speed 6. For each freeway, there are cars listed with their head, tail, direction, and speed. Since all are right-moving, the span is [τ, h] and it moves right, so at time T, the span is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)].\n\nt_1 is 1, so for any turn T, the position change is s(T - 1).\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, I am on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn T. That means the car covers position 0 on the x-axis at turn T.\n\nAlso, when I move, I change y at the end of the turn, so at turn T, I am on y_T, and I decide action a_T to go to y_{T+1}. But the position at turn T is (0, y_T), and after action, I move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and collision if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nIf I move to a different freeway, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn, so I don't collide with cars on the new freeway at the current turn.\n\nIn this case, since I start at y=0, which is not a freeway, I think y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars. Freeways are from y=1 to y=8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so safe.\n\nI need to go to (0,9), so y=9 is safe.\n\nNow, I need to move up through y=1 to y=8 without getting hit by cars.\n\nEach action: U for up (+1 y), D for down (-1 y), S for stay (0 change).\n\ny must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nMinimize the number of turns H.\n\nStart at turn t=1, position y=0.\n\nAfter action a_1, I move to y_2, and so on, until some turn when I reach y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=1 to t_1 + H - 1, I perform actions, and at turn t_1 + H - 1, I am at y=9.\n\nSet t=1 as the current turn.\n\nAt turn 1, I am at y=0.\n\nI need to choose actions a_1, a_2, ..., up to a_{K} such that after K actions, I am at y=9, and K is minimal, but H is the number of turns, including the start? Let's see.\n\nTurn t_1 + t for t from 0 to H-1, but t_1 is given as 1.\n\nIn the sequence, it says {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, but t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H - 1}.\n\nAt turn t, I perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nStandard: at turn t, position is (0, y_t), then I choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}), and so on.\n\nI start at turn 1, y_1 = 0.\n\nAfter action a_1, y_2 = y_1 + Δy_1.\n\nAt turn 2, position y_2, and so on.\n\nI need to reach y_T = 9 for some turn T.\n\nThe minimal H such that at turn t_1 + H - 1, y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nSince t_1=1, turn H, y_H = 9? Let's index properly.\n\nSet t from 1.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo y_{t+1} is set based on a_t.\n\nI need y_T = 9 for some T.\n\nThe turn when I am at y=9 is turn T.\n\nThen H is such that t_1 + H - 1 = T.\n\nSince t_1=1, H-1 = T-1, so H = T.\n\nt_1 + H - 1 = T, t_1=1, so 1 + H - 1 = H = T.\n\nSo H is the turn number when I reach y=9.\n\nAnd I need actions from turn 1 to turn H, but actions are from a_1 to a_{H-1}, because a_t determines the move to next position.\n\nStart: turn 1, y_1 = 0.\n\nI choose a_1, which sets y_2.\n\nThen at turn 2, y_2, choose a_2, sets y_3, ..., until at some turn H, y_H = 9.\n\nI reach y_H = 9, meaning I am at position 9 at the start of turn H, or after action of turn H-1.\n\nAt turn H, I am at y_H = 9, and I don't need to move further, but since I am at 9, I can stop, and no action for turn H if I don't move, but in the sequence, actions are up to when I reach.\n\nIn the action sequence, for t from 0 to H-1, a_{t_1 + t}, so for t_1=1, a_1 to a_H, but when I am at y_H=9, I don't need to take an action, but the action to get to y_H is a_{H-1}.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nThe sequence of actions {a_t for t = t_1 to t_1 + H - 1} such that after H actions, I am at y=9.\n\nFrom the position update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t_1} given.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nThen the turn when I am at y=9 is t_1 + H.\n\nBut the position at turn t is y_t.\n\nAt turn t_1, y_{t_1} = 0.\n\nAfter first action a_{t_1}, y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}.\n\nAfter second action a_{t_1 +1}, y_{t_1 +2} = y_{t_1 +1} + Δy_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H, I am at (0,9).\n\nThe actions are from turn t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, total H actions.\n\nFor each action a_t, it is chosen at turn t, and affects y_{t+1}.\n\nIn the collision, at each turn t, when I am at position (0, y_t), if y_t is between 1 and 8, I must not have a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at turn t.\n\nThe span at turn t is for car k, based on initial at t_1=1.\n\nt_1=1 is the current turn.\n\nFor a turn T, the car span is based on T - t_1 = T - 1.\n\nSince t_1=1.\n\nFor turn T, the span for a car is [τ + s(T - 1), h + s(T - 1)] for right-moving cars, since all are right-moving.\n\nIn the table, for each freeway, cars are listed as (h, τ, d, s), but for right-moving, it says head h, tail τ, and span [τ, h] with h > τ I assume, since moving right.\n\nIn the description, for right-moving: span at t_1 is [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)].\n\nSimilarly for left, but all are right here.\n\nIn the car state, for example, freeway 1: cars (-42, -53, right, 6) and (6, -5, right, 6)\n\nNow, for a car, head and tail: for right-moving, head is the front, so h should be greater than τ.\n\nIn the first car: h=-42, τ=-53, so τ=-53, h=-42, so h > τ, yes, since -42 > -53.\n\nSpan at t_1=1: [τ, h] = [-53, -42]\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=6, τ=-5, but τ=-5, h=6, so [ -5, 6]\n\n-5 to 6, which includes 0? -5 to 6, yes, 0 is between -5 and 6.\n\nAt turn t_1=1, for freeway 1, there is a car with span [-5,6], so 0 is in it, so if I were on freeway 1 at turn 1, I would collide, but I am at y=0, not on freeway.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nBut I need to see for future turns when I might be on a freeway.\n\nNow, for each freeway k, and for each car, the span at turn T is [τ + 6(T-1), h + 6(T-1)] for right-moving.\n\nCollision on freeway k at turn T if y_T = k and 0 is in [τ + 6(T-1), h + 6(T-1)] for some car on freeway k.\n\nSince the car spans are moving right at speed 6, the position where they cover x=0 changes with time.\n\nFor a given freeway, I need to find when it is safe to be there, i.e., when no car covers x=0.\n\nSince the cars are at different positions, I need to find for each freeway the times when 0 is not covered by any car.\n\nFirst, list all cars per freeway.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: cars: (h,τ,d,s) = (-42,-53,right,6) and (6,-5,right,6)\n\nFreeway 2: same as 1? \"(-42, -53, right, 6), (6, -5, right, 6)\" for all freeways 1 to 4.\n\nFreeway 1 to 4 have identical cars: two cars each: car A: h=-42, τ=-53 and car B: h=6, τ=-5\n\nFreeway 5 to 8 have three cars each: car A: (-42,-53,right,6), car C: (-6,-17,right,6), car D: (30,19,right,6)\n\nFor freeway 5: (-42,-53,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6), (30,19,right,6)\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\nNow, for each freeway, find the span that covers x=0 over time.\n\nFirst, for freeway k, at turn T, collision if y_T = k and min over cars of (τ + 6(T-1)) <= 0 <= max over cars? No, for each car, the span is an interval.\n\nFor a single car, if τ + 6(T-1) <= 0 <= h + 6(T-1) for that car.\n\nSince the car may have τ or h negative or positive.\n\nGenerally, for a car, the span at T is [τ + 6(T-1), h + 6(T-1)]\n\n0 in [low, high] where low = τ + 6(T-1), high = h + 6(T-1)\n\nSo low <= 0 <= high.\n\nWhich is τ + 6(T-1) <= 0 and 0 <= h + 6(T-1)\n\nSo τ + 6(T-1) <= 0 <= h + 6(T-1)\n\nNow, solve for T.\n\nFirst inequality: τ + 6(T-1) <= 0\n\n6(T-1) <= -τ\n\nT-1 <= -τ / 6\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= h + 6(T-1)\n\n- h <= 6(T-1)\n\nT-1 >= -h/6\n\nSo for a car, 0 is covered when T-1 >= ceil(-h/6) and T-1 <= floor(-τ/6)? Let's be careful.\n\nFrom τ + 6(T-1) <= 0 <= h + 6(T-1)\n\nSince the inequalities may not be integer, but T is integer, so we need to find T such that low <= 0 <= high.\n\nlow = τ + 6(T-1)\n\nhigh = h + 6(T-1)\n\nlow <= 0 <= high\n\nSo τ + 6(T-1) <= 0 and h + 6(T-1) >= 0\n\nNow, τ + 6(T-1) <= 0 implies 6(T-1) <= -τ, so T-1 <= floor(-τ/6) ? No.\n\nLet's keep it as inequalities.\n\n6(T-1) <= -τ\n\nSince T-1 integer, T-1 <= floor(-τ / 6) if -τ/6 not integer, but better to compute numerically.\n\nSimilarly, h + 6(T-1) >= 0 implies 6(T-1) >= -h, so T-1 >= ceil(-h/6)\n\nLet's take an example.\n\nFor car B on freeway 1: h=6, τ=-5\n\nAt turn T, low = τ + 6(T-1) = -5 + 6(T-1)\n\nhigh = h + 6(T-1) = 6 + 6(T-1)\n\n0 in [low, high] when -5 + 6(T-1) <= 0 <= 6 + 6(T-1)\n\nFirst, -5 + 6(T-1) <= 0 => 6(T-1) <= 5 => T-1 <= 5/6 ≈ 0.833, so T-1 <= 0 since T-1 integer? T-1 <= floor(5/6) = 0? 5/6<1, floor=0, T-1 <=0\n\n6(T-1) <=5, T-1 <= 5/6 <1, so T-1 <=0\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 6 + 6(T-1) always true since 6(T-1) >= -6 for T-1 >=0, but 6 + 6(T-1) >=0 for all T-1 >= -1, but T-1 >=0 probably.\n\nT is turn number, T >= t_1 =1, so T-1 >=0.\n\nSo for car B, low = -5 + 6(T-1) <=0\n\n-5 + 6(T-1) <=0 => 6(T-1) <=5 => T-1 <= 5/6 <1, so for T-1=0, low = -5 +0 = -5 <=0, true\n\nFor T-1=1, low = -5+6=1 >0, not <=0\n\nhigh =6 +6(T-1) >=0 always true for T-1>=0.\n\nSo 0 in [low,high] only when low <=0, which is T-1=0, i.e., T=1.\n\nAt T=1, low=-5, high=6, so [ -5,6], 0 in it.\n\nFor T=2, low = -5 +6(1) =1, high=6+6=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for higher T.\n\nNow car A on freeway 1: h=-42, τ=-53\n\nlow = τ +6(T-1) = -53 +6(T-1)\n\nhigh = -42 +6(T-1)\n\n0 in [low,high] when -53 +6(T-1) <=0 <= -42 +6(T-1)\n\nFirst, -53 +6(T-1) <=0 => 6(T-1) <=53 => T-1 <= 53/6 ≈8.833, so T-1 <=8\n\nSecond, 0 <= -42 +6(T-1) => 42 <= 6(T-1) => 7 <= T-1 => T-1 >=7\n\nSo T-1 >=7 and T-1 <=8\n\nSo for T-1=7 or 8, i.e., T=8 or 9\n\nAt T=8, T-1=7, low= -53 +42 = -11? 6*7=42, low=-53+42=-11, high=-42+42=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt T=9, T-1=8, low=-53+48=-5, high=-42+48=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt T=10, low=-53+54=1, high=-42+54=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, cars cover x=0 at:\n\n- Car A: at T=8,9\n\n- Car B: at T=1\n\nSo at turn T, collision on freeway 1 if y_T=1 and T=1 or T=8 or T=9.\n\nFor other freeways 2,3,4, same cars, so same unsafe times: T=1,8,9\n\nNow freeway 5 to 8 have three cars.\n\nTake freeway 5: cars: A: (-42,-53,right,6), C: (-6,-17,right,6), D: (30,19,right,6)\n\nFirst, car D: h=30, τ=19, but for right-moving, span [τ,h] = [19,30], so low=19 +6(T-1), high=30+6(T-1)\n\nSince low=19+6(T-1) >0 for T-1>=0, so 0 < low <= high, so 0 not in [low,high] for any T, since min is 19 at T=1, which is >0. So car D never covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly, car A: same as before, covers at T=8,9\n\nCar C: h=-6, τ=-17\n\nlow = τ +6(T-1) = -17 +6(T-1)\n\nhigh = h +6(T-1) = -6 +6(T-1)\n\n0 in [low,high] when -17 +6(T-1) <=0 <= -6 +6(T-1)\n\nFirst: -17 +6(T-1) <=0 => 6(T-1) <=17 => T-1 <= 17/6 ≈2.833, so T-1 <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -6 +6(T-1) => 6 <= 6(T-1) => 1 <= T-1 => T-1 >=1\n\nSo T-1 >=1 and T-1 <=2, so T-1=1 or 2, T=2 or 3\n\nAt T=2, T-1=1, low=-17+6=-11, high=-6+6=0, [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt T=3, T-1=2, low=-17+12=-5, high=-6+12=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt T=4, low=-17+18=1, high=-6+18=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 5, cars cover x=0:\n\n- Car A: T=8,9\n\n- Car C: T=2,3\n\n- Car D: never\n\nSo unsafe at T=2,3,8,9\n\nSimilarly for freeways 6,7,8, same as 5.\n\nFreeway 5 to 8 have the same cars, so all have unsafe times T=2,3,8,9.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway when it is unsafe (collision if on it at that turn):\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=1,8,9\n\nFreeway 2: same, T=1,8,9\n\nFreeway 3: same, T=1,8,9\n\nFreeway 4: same, T=1,8,9\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at T=2,3,8,9\n\nFreeway 6: same, T=2,3,8,9\n\nFreeway 7: same, T=2,3,8,9\n\nFreeway 8: same, T=2,3,8,9\n\nAnd for all, at other times, safe to be on that freeway.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9, starting at turn 1, y_1=0.\n\nI can move up, down, or stay, but since I need to go up, and minimize turns, probably mostly up, but I need to avoid being on a freeway when it is unsafe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe, no cars.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T, and I need to ensure that for each T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, it is not an unsafe time for that freeway.\n\ny_T is the row I am on at turn T.\n\nI start at T=1, y_1=0, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since I start at y=0, need to go to y=9, the minimum moves are 9 up actions, but I might need to stay or move down to avoid collisions, which would increase turns.\n\nBut with collisions, I might need to delay or something.\n\nSince I can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, the minimal path in terms of steps is 9 moves up, but I might need to take detours or wait.\n\nBut in this case, since the unsafe times are specific, I can plan a path that avoids being on unsafe freeway at unsafe times.\n\nList the unsafe times for each row:\n\nRow 1: unsafe T=1,8,9\n\nRow 2: same as row1? Freeway 1 is y=1, freeway 2 is y=2, etc.\n\nFreeway k corresponds to row y=k.\n\nSo:\n\nFor row y=1: unsafe at T=1,8,9\n\ny=2: unsafe T=1,8,9\n\ny=3: unsafe T=1,8,9\n\ny=4: unsafe T=1,8,9\n\ny=5: unsafe T=2,3,8,9\n\ny=6: unsafe T=2,3,8,9\n\ny=7: unsafe T=2,3,8,9\n\ny=8: unsafe T=2,3,8,9\n\nNow, I need to be at some sequence of positions.\n\nStart T=1, y=0, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some T.\n\nThe net displacement must be +9, each action changes y by -1,0,+1, so to go from 0 to 9, the minimal number of actions is 9, if all up, but I might need more if I stay or go down.\n\nBut with collisions, I might need to take more turns to avoid being on certain rows at certain times.\n\nSince the unsafe times are early and late, I might be able to go through the middle rows when they are safe.\n\nFor example, rows 1-4 are unsafe only at T=1,8,9, so for T=2 to7, they are safe? T=1 unsafe, T=8,9 unsafe, but T=2 to7 should be safe for y=1-4.\n\nSimilarly for y=5-8, unsafe at T=2,3,8,9, so for T=4,5,6,7 should be safe? T=2,3 unsafe, T=8,9 unsafe, so T=4,5,6,7 are safe for y=5-8.\n\nT=4,5,6,7: for y=5-8, since unsafe only at 2,3,8,9, so yes, T=4,5,6,7 safe for rows 5-8.\n\nSimilarly, for y=1-4, unsafe at 1,8,9, so safe at T=2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nT=1 unsafe, T=8,9 unsafe, so safe for T=2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nNow, I am at T=1, y=0.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=9 is if I go all up, but let's see if possible.\n\nIf I go all up from T=1.\n\nStart T=1, y=0.\n\nAction a_1: U, then y_2 = 0 +1 =1\n\nBut at turn T=2, position y_2=1.\n\nNow, row 1 is unsafe at T=1,8,9, but T=2 is safe for row 1, since safe at T=2 to7.\n\nT=2, y=1, row 1 safe at T=2, so ok.\n\nThen a_2: U, y_3=2\n\nT=3, y=2, row 2 safe at T=3? y=2, row 2 unsafe at T=1,8,9, so T=3 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_3: U, y_4=3, T=4, safe.\n\na_4: U, y_5=4, T=5, row 4 safe? y=4, row 4 unsafe at T=1,8,9, so T=5 safe.\n\nNow a_5: U, y_6=5, T=6, position y=5.\n\nRow 5 is unsafe at T=2,3,8,9. T=6 is not in 2,3,8,9, so safe? T=6, not unsafe times, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_6: U, y_7=6, T=7, y=6, row 6 unsafe at T=2,3,8,9, T=7 not, safe.\n\na_7: U, y_8=7, T=8, y=7, row 7 unsafe at T=2,3,8,9. T=8 is unsafe! Oh.\n\nT=8, row 7 is unsafe because for rows 5-8, T=8 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 also unsafe at T=8.\n\nSo at T=8, if I am on y=7, row 7, it is unsafe.\n\nBut in this sequence, at T=8, y_8=7, which is unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\nSo I cannot be on row 7 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, if I continue: a_7: U to y=7 at T=8? Let's index.\n\nAt turn T=7, I am at y_7=6? Let's list the turns.\n\nT=1: y=0, safe\n\na1=U, y2=1\n\nT=2: y=1, safe (row1 safe at T=2)\n\na2=U, y3=2\n\nT=3: y=2, safe\n\na3=U, y4=3\n\nT=4: y=3, safe\n\na4=U, y5=4\n\nT=5: y=4, safe (row4 safe)\n\na5=U, y6=5\n\nT=6: y=5, row5 safe at T=6? unsafe at 2,3,8,9, T=6 not, safe\n\na6=U, y7=6\n\nT=7: y=6, row6 safe at T=7? unsafe at 2,3,8,9, T=7 not, safe\n\na7=U, y8=7\n\nT=8: y=7, row7 unsafe at T=8, collision.\n\nIf I do S or D, but I need to go up.\n\nAt T=7, y=6, I could do S, then y8=6, T=8 position y=6.\n\nRow6 unsafe at T=8, since for y=6, T=8 unsafe, so still collision.\n\nIf I do D, y8=5, T=8 y=5, row5 unsafe at T=8, collision.\n\nSo at T=8, rows 1-8 are all unsafe? Rows 1-4 unsafe at T=8,9, rows 5-8 unsafe at T=8,9.\n\nAt T=8, all freeways y=1 to8 are unsafe.\n\nSimilarly at T=9.\n\nAt T=1, rows 1-4 unsafe, but I was not on them.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, all rows 1-8 are unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot be on any freeway at T=8 or T=9.\n\nI must be either at y=0 or y=9 at turn T=8 and T=9.\n\ny=0 or y=9 are safe.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI need to reach y=9 before or at T=7, or after T=9, but since I start at T=1, reaching after T=9 would take more turns, so better to reach by T=7 if possible.\n\nMinimal turns.\n\nIf I can reach y=9 by T=7.\n\nStart at T=1, y=0.\n\nAfter 6 up moves, I can be at y=6 at T=7? Let's see the timing.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k, position y_{t_1 + k}\n\nt_1=1.\n\nAfter 0 actions, turn 1, y=0.\n\nAfter first action, turn 2, y= y1 + Δy1\n\nAfter second action, turn 3, y= y2 + Δy2, etc.\n\nAfter m actions, at turn 1 + m, position y_{1+m}\n\nI need y_{1+m} =9 for some m.\n\nm is the number of actions, H in the notation.\n\nIn the problem, H is the minimal number such that at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9, but let's use the turn number.\n\nSet T as turn number.\n\nI need to reach y_T =9 for some T.\n\nWith actions from turn 1 to T-1.\n\nThe position sequence y1 to yT, with y1=0, yT=9, and |y_{t+1} - y_t| <=1 for each t.\n\nAnd for each t, if y_t in 1-8, then t not unsafe for that row.\n\nNow, unsafe times: for all rows, T=8 and T=9 are unsafe, so I cannot be on any 1-8 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nTherefore, at T=8 and T=9, I must be at y=0 or y=9.\n\nBut since I need to reach y=9, probably at T=8 or T=9 I am at y=9.\n\nIf I am at y=9 at T=8, then for T=9, if I stay or something, but y=9 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I reach at T=7, then at T=8 I need to be at safe position.\n\nBut let's find the earliest possible T to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal T: since I start at y=0, to go to y=9, minimal T is 10 if I move up every turn: T=1 y=0, T=2 y=1, ..., T=10 y=9.\n\nBut at T=2, y=1, which is safe for row1 since T=2 not unsafe.\n\nT=3 y=2, safe, ..., up to T=7 y=6, safe as before.\n\nThen T=8 y=7, but row7 unsafe at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to T=8 y=7, unsafe.\n\nT=9 y=8, but row8 unsafe at T=9.\n\nT=10 y=9, safe.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, I am on freeway, unsafe.\n\nSo the sequence T=2 to T=9 I am on freeway, but at T=8 and T=9 unsafe.\n\nSpecifically, at T=8, if y=7, unsafe; T=9 y=8, unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, I need to not be on freeway at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSo I must be at y=0 or y=9 at those turns.\n\nSince I am going to y=9, better to be at y=9 by T=8.\n\nBut to reach y=9 by T=8, I need to be at y=9 at turn T=8.\n\nThat means from start, in 7 moves: from T=1 to T=8, 7 actions? From turn 1 to turn 8, that is 7 actions? Positions: start T=1 y=0, after 7 actions, turn 8 y=8? After k actions, at turn 1+k.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn T, I need T-1 actions if all up, but since y starts at 0, after (9-0)=9 actions I am at turn 10 y=9.\n\nTurn T, y_T: to go from y1=0 to yT=9, the number of actions is T-1.\n\ny_T = y1 + sum_{t=1}^{T-1} Δy_t\n\nSince each |Δy_t| <=1, to increase by 9, T-1 >=9.\n\nMinimal T is 10, with y10=9, after 9 up actions.\n\nThen positions: T=1 y=0, T=2 y=1, T=3 y=2, ..., T=10 y=9.\n\nNow check collisions:\n\nT=2: y=1, row1 safe (T=2 not 1,8,9)\n\nT=3: y=2, row2 safe (T=3 not unsafe)\n\nT=4: y=3, row3 safe\n\nT=5: y=4, row4 safe\n\nT=6: y=5, row5 unsafe at T=2,3,8,9; T=6 not, safe\n\nT=7: y=6, row6 unsafe at T=2,3,8,9; T=7 not, safe\n\nT=8: y=7, row7 unsafe at T=8, collision! Not safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=9: y=8, row8 unsafe at T=9, collision.\n\nT=10: y=9, safe.\n\nSo at T=8 and T=9, collisions.\n\nTo avoid, I need to not be on freeway at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSo for T=8 and T=9, I must be at y=0 or y=9.\n\nSince I am going up, I can be at y=9 by T=8, but to reach y=9 by T=8, I need to be at y=9 at turn 8.\n\nThat requires y8=9.\n\nFrom y1=0 to y8=9, I need to increase by 9 in 7 actions (from t=1 to t=7 actions, to set y2 to y8).\n\nActions from t=1 to t=7 determine y2 to y8.\n\ny8 = y1 + sum_{t=1}^7 Δy_t = 0 + sum_{t=1}^7 Δy_t\n\nSet y8=9, so sum_{t=1}^7 Δy_t =9\n\nEach Δy_t <=1, so sum <=7, but 9>7, impossible.\n\nMax increase in 7 actions is 7, to y8=7.\n\nSimilarly, min to y8=0 if all down, but not useful.\n\nSo I cannot reach y=9 by T=8.\n\nSimilarly, by T=9: y9=9.\n\ny9 = y1 + sum_{t=1}^8 Δy_t = 0 + sum_{t=1}^8 Δy_t\n\nSet y9=9, so sum_{t=1}^8 Δy_t =9\n\nMax sum is 8, if all up, y9=8.\n\nCannot reach y=9 by T=9.\n\nBy T=10: y10=9, with sum_{t=1}^9 Δy_t =9, possible with all up.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, I am on y=7 and y=8, which are unsafe.\n\nTo avoid being on freeway at T=8 and T=9, I need to be at y=0 or y=9 at those turns.\n\nBut I cannot be at y=9 until T=10 at earliest.\n\nSo at T=8 and T=9, I must be at y=0.\n\nBut I start at y=0 at T=1.\n\nIf I am at y=0 at T=8 and T=9, that means I went down or stayed low.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9 eventually, so I have to go up later.\n\nBut that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, I can stay low until after T=9, then go up.\n\nBut let's see the unsafe times.\n\nT=8 and T=9 are unsafe for all, but other times are safe for most rows.\n\nFor instance, from T=2 to T=7, rows 1-4 are safe.\n\nT=4 to T=7, rows 5-8 are safe, since unsafe at 2,3,8,9.\n\nT=4,5,6,7 safe for rows 5-8.\n\nT=2,3,4,5,6,7 safe for rows 1-4.\n\nBut T=2 and T=3: for rows 1-4, T=2 and T=3 are safe, but for rows 5-8, T=2 and T=3 are unsafe.\n\nSo at T=2 and T=3, rows 5-8 are unsafe, but rows 1-4 are safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=4 to7, all rows 1-8 are safe? Rows 1-4 safe at T=4,5,6,7; rows 5-8 safe at T=4,5,6,7.\n\nYes, because for y=1-4, safe T=2,3,4,5,6,7; for y=5-8, safe T=4,5,6,7.\n\nSo at T=4,5,6,7, all rows 1-8 are safe.\n\nAt T=2 and T=3, only rows 1-4 are safe, rows 5-8 are unsafe.\n\nAt T=1, rows 1-4 unsafe, but I am at y=0.\n\nAt T=8 and T=9, all rows 1-8 unsafe.\n\nT=10 and later, for rows 1-4, unsafe only at T=8,9, so for T=10, safe; similarly for rows 5-8, unsafe at T=8,9, so T=10 safe.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nTo minimize T, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on freeway at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSince I cannot be at y=9 before T=10, and at T=8 and T=9 I must not be on 1-8, so I must be at y=0 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nThen I can go up after T=9.\n\nBut let's plan.\n\nFirst, from T=1 to T=7, I can be on freeways only at safe times.\n\nSince at T=4,5,6,7 all rows safe, I can be anywhere.\n\nAt T=2 and T=3, only rows 1-4 safe, I cannot be on rows 5-8.\n\nAt T=1, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=0 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nThen from T=9 onwards, I can go to y=9.\n\nBut at T=9, I am at y=0, then I need to go up to y=9, which takes at least 9 actions, so from T=9, after 9 actions, at turn T=18, y=9.\n\nBut that is late, T=18.\n\nI can reach earlier if I go up before T=8 but not on freeway at T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut I must be at y=0 or y=9 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSince y=9 not possible before T=10, so only y=0.\n\nSo I need to be at y=0 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nThen, from T=1 to T=7, I can move, but at T=8 and T=9 I am at y=0.\n\nAt T=9, if I am at y=0, I can start moving up.\n\nBut to be at y=0 at T=8, that means at turn T=8, position y=0.\n\nSimilarly T=9 y=0.\n\nThen from T=10, I can go up to y=9 at T=19, for example, with all up.\n\nBut T=19 is large.\n\nSince at T=4 to7 all rows safe, I can go up to high position by T=7, then at T=8 and T=9 go down to y=0 or something, but y=0 is the only safe below.\n\nFor example, at T=7, I can be at y=7, for example, which is safe.\n\nThen at T=8, if I move down to y=6, but row6 unsafe at T=8, collision.\n\nIf I move down to y=7 to y=6, at T=8 position y=6, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay at y=7, T=8 y=7, unsafe.\n\nOnly if I go to y=0, but from y=7 to y=0 in one move? Cannot, only change by 1 per turn.\n\nAt T=7, y=7, I choose a7, which sets y8.\n\nIf I choose D, y8=6, but at T=8 position y=6, unsafe.\n\nIf S, y8=7, unsafe.\n\nIf U, y8=8, unsafe.\n\nAll unsafe because at T=8, all rows 1-8 unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot be on rows 1-8 at T=8, so at T=7, whatever I do, y8 will be between 0 and 9, but if y8 in 1-8, unsafe, only y8=0 or 9 safe, but y8=9 not possible from y=7 in one action, since |Δy|<=1, so y8 can be 6,7,8 from y=7, all unsafe, or if y=8, y8=7,8,9, but y=9 not possible, so 7 or 8 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, from any position at T=7, except y=0, I will be on 1-8 at T=8 if I move to it.\n\nBut at T=7, if I am at y=0, then at T=8 I can be at y=0 or y=1.\n\nIf at T=8 I am at y=0, safe.\n\nThen at T=9, I can stay at y=0 or go to y=1.\n\nBut to be safe at T=9, I need to be at y=0 or y=9, so I can stay at y=0.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut to be at y=0 at T=7 and T=8, etc.\n\nSo the only way to avoid collision at T=8 and T=9 is to be at y=0 at those turns.\n\nTherefore, I must be at y=0 at turn T=8 and T=9.\n\nThen, I can start moving up from T=9 onwards.\n\nAt T=9, y=0, I choose action to go to y=1 or stay.\n\nThen continue to y=9.\n\nNow, to minimize T when I reach y=9.\n\nSince I am at y=0 at T=9, I need to go to y=9, which takes at least 9 actions, so at turn T=18, y=9.\n\nBut is that the earliest? T=18.\n\nPerhaps I can be at a higher position before T=8, but I have to come down to y=0 for T=8 and T=9.\n\nFor example, by T=7, I can be at y=7, but then I need to go down to y=0 for T=8, but from T=7 to T=8, I can only change by 1, so from y=7 at T=7, I can go to y=6 at T=8, but y=6 at T=8 is unsafe, and I cannot go directly to y=0.\n\nSo I cannot reach y=0 at T=8 from a high position; I must be low before.\n\nSpecifically, to be at y=0 at T=8, I need to be at y=0 or y=1 at T=7.\n\nIf at T=7 y=1, then I can go down to y=0 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=0 at T=9, from T=8 y=0, I can stay or move.\n\nBut since T=9 I need to be at y=0 or 9, I can stay at y=0.\n\nSo, let's plan the path to be at y=0 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFirst, at T=1, y=0.\n\nI need to be at y=0 at T=8.\n\nFrom T=1 to T=8, I can move around, but net displacement 0, since y1=0, y8=0.\n\nSo the sum of Δy from t=1 to 7 must be 0, because y8 = y1 + sum_{t=1}^7 Δy_t, so 0 = 0 + sum, so sum Δy_t from t=1 to7 =0.\n\nSimilarly, for T=9, y9=0, so sum from t=1 to8 Δy_t =0.\n\nBut since y8=0, and y9=0, then Δy8 =0, so S at turn 8.\n\nNow, to minimize the time to reach y=9, I should go up as much as possible before T=8, but since I need to return to y=0 at T=8, I have to go down, which wastes turns.\n\nThen after T=9, I go up.\n\nThe fastest way is to stay at y=0 until T=9, then go up to y=9 in 9 turns, reaching T=18.\n\nBut I can move during T=2 to T=7 to be at higher y, but then I have to come down to y=0 at T=8, so the net is zero, so no gain, and I might risk collision if I go to unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at T=2 and T=3, I can be on rows 1-4 safely.\n\nSuppose at T=2, I go to y=1, safe.\n\nT=3, y=2, safe.\n\nT=4, y=3, safe.\n\nT=5, y=4, safe.\n\nT=6, y=5, safe (T=6, row5 safe)\n\nT=7, y=6, safe (T=7, row6 safe)\n\nThen at T=7, y=6.\n\nNow to be at y=0 at T=8, I need to go down to y=5, but then at T=8 y=5, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I go down gradually, but at T=8 I need y=0, from y=6 at T=7, I can only go to y=5,6,7 at T=8, all unsafe.\n\nCannot reach y=0 from y=6 in one step.\n\nTo be at y=0 at T=8, I need to be at y=0 or y=1 at T=7.\n\nIf at T=7 y=1, then I can go down to y=0 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=1 at T=7, I need to be at y=0,1,2 at T=6, and so on.\n\nSo let's set that at T=7, I am at y=1.\n\nThen a7 = D, so y8 = y7 + Δy7 =1 + (-1) =0, so at T=8 y=0.\n\nThen at T=8, y=0, I can choose a8 = S, so y9 =0 +0 =0, at T=9 y=0.\n\nThen from T=9, I start moving up.\n\na9 = U, y10=1\n\nT=10 y=1, row1 unsafe at T=1,8,9; T=10 not, safe.\n\na10=U, y11=2, T=11 y=2, safe\n\n...\n\nup to a17=U, y18=9, T=18 y=9.\n\nReach at T=18.\n\nBut is this minimal? T=18.\n\nI could reach earlier if I can be at y=9 at T=10, but at T=8 and T=9 I am on freeway, which is unsafe, so I cannot.\n\nUnless I can be at y=9 at T=8 or T=9, but impossible as we saw.\n\nSo T=10 is impossible because to be at y=9 at T=10, I must be on y=8 at T=9, which is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, any earlier not possible.\n\nSo the earliest possible to reach y=9 is T=10, but with collision at T=8 and T=9 if I go directly.\n\nTo avoid collision, I must delay until after T=9.\n\nSo minimal T is 18, as above.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can do better.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=4 by T=5, for example.\n\nT=1 y=0\n\na1=U, y2=1 T=2 y=1 safe\n\na2=U, y3=2 T=3 y=2 safe\n\na3=U, y4=3 T=4 y=3 safe\n\na4=U, y5=4 T=5 y=4 safe\n\nNow at T=5, y=4.\n\nI need to be back to y=0 at T=8.\n\nFrom T=5 to T=8, 3 turns: T=5,6,7 actions to set y6,y7,y8.\n\ny8=0.\n\ny5=4, y8=0, so I need to decrease by 4 in 3 actions, possible with down moves.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt T=5, y=4, choose a5=D, y6=3\n\nT=6 y=3, row3 safe at T=6? y=3, row3 unsafe at T=1,8,9, T=6 not, safe.\n\na6=D, y7=2\n\nT=7 y=2, safe\n\na7=D, y8=1\n\nBut y8=1, which is row1, at T=8, unsafe! Collision.\n\nProblem.\n\ny8=1, but T=8 row1 unsafe.\n\nI need y8=0.\n\nIn this case y8=1, not 0.\n\nTo have y8=0, from y5=4, in 3 actions, I can go down to y=1 at T=8, but not to 0.\n\ny5=4, after a5, y6=3,4, or5\n\nIf down to y6=3\n\na6, y7=2,3,4\n\nIf down to y7=2\n\na7, y8=1,2,3\n\nSo y8 can be 1,2,3, all between 1 and 3, so at T=8, on freeway, unsafe.\n\nCannot reach y=0 at T=8 from y=4 at T=5.\n\nTo reach y=0 at T=8, I need to be at y=0 or y=1 at T=7.\n\nIf at T=7 y=1, then a7=D, y8=0.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=1 at T=7, I can be at lower levels.\n\nFor example, stay low.\n\nAt T=1 y=0\n\nI can stay at y=0 or move up slightly but come back.\n\nBut to minimize time to reach y=9, I should not move up before, because I have to come back, net zero progress.\n\nSo best to stay at y=0 until T=9, then go up.\n\nAt T=1 y=0, safe.\n\na1=S, y2=0, T=2 y=0, safe (y=0 safe)\n\nSimilarly, a2=S, y3=0, T=3 y=0\n\na3=S, y4=0, T=4 y=0\n\na4=S, y5=0, T=5 y=0\n\na5=S, y6=0, T=6 y=0\n\na6=S, y7=0, T=7 y=0\n\na7=D? No, to go to y8=0.\n\nAt T=7 y=0, I can choose a7=S, then y8=0, T=8 y=0 safe\n\nThen a8=S, y9=0, T=9 y=0 safe\n\nThen from T=9, start moving up:\n\na9=U, y10=1, T=10 y=1, safe (T=10 not unsafe for row1)\n\na10=U, y11=2, T=11 y=2, safe\n\na11=U, y12=3, T=12 y=3, safe\n\na12=U, y13=4, T=13 y=4, safe\n\na13=U, y14=5, T=14 y=5, row5 unsafe at T=2,3,8,9; T=14 not, safe\n\na14=U, y15=6, T=15 y=6, safe\n\na15=U, y16=7, T=16 y=7, safe\n\na16=U, y17=8, T=17 y=8, row8 unsafe at T=2,3,8,9; T=17 not, safe\n\na17=U, y18=9, T=18 y=9\n\nReached at T=18.\n\nBut earlier I thought about moving during T=2-7, but it doesn't help to reach faster, and I might have collision risk.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=4 at T=5 and back, but I can't get to y=0 at T=8, as before.\n\nSuppose at T=7 I am at y=1.\n\nHow to be at y=1 at T=7.\n\nFor example, from start:\n\nT=1 y=0\n\na1=U, y2=1 T=2 y=1 safe\n\nThen stay or move.\n\nBut I need to be at y=1 at T=7.\n\nFrom T=2 to T=7, 5 actions, y7 = y2 + sum_{t=2}^6 Δy_t? Actions from t=2 to t=6 determine y3 to y7.\n\ny2=1\n\ny7 = y2 + sum_{t=2}^6 Δy_t\n\nSet y7=1, so sum_{t=2}^6 Δy_t =0\n\nThen at T=7 y=1\n\nThen a7=D, y8=0\n\nThen a8=S, y9=0\n\nThen go up from T=9.\n\nBut I reach y=9 at same time T=18, since from T=9 y=0 to T=18 y=9.\n\nNo gain.\n\nAnd during T=2 to T=7, I was moving but net zero, so same number of turns.\n\nMoreover, I might have been on unsafe times, but in this case, for rows 1-4, T=2 to7 are safe, so if I stay on y=1 to4, it should be ok.\n\nBut no benefit.\n\nSo minimal H is 18, with actions as above.\n\nBut H is the turn when I reach y=9, so T=18.\n\nIn the action sequence, I need to output actions from turn t_1=1 to turn t_1 + H -1 =1 + 17 =18? Let's see.\n\nH is such that at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nt_1=1, so at turn 1 + H -1 = H, y_H=9.\n\nSo H=18.\n\nActions from turn 1 to turn 17, since actions determine next position.\n\nActions a_t for t=1 to 17, with y_{18}=9.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to 17, a_{1+0} to a_{1+17} = a1 to a18.\n\nBut a18 would determine y19, but I reach at turn H=18, so I don't need action at turn 18.\n\nIn the position, at turn T, I am at y_T, after action a_T, I go to y_{T+1}.\n\nWhen I am at y_T=9 at turn T, I have arrived, so no further action needed.\n\nSo actions only up to a_{T-1} to reach y_T.\n\nFor example, to reach y_T=9, actions from t=1 to t=T-1.\n\nWith y1=0.\n\nAfter T-1 actions, y_T = y1 + sum_{t=1}^{T-1} Δy_t = 0 + sum =9.\n\nNumber of actions: T-1.\n\nThen at turn T, I am at y_T=9.\n\nIn this case, for T=18, I need 17 actions.\n\nActions from turn 1 to 17.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t_1=1 to turn 1 + H -1 = H, but t_1 + H -1 =1 + H -1 = H, so actions from turn 1 to turn H-1? Let's read the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, a_{t_1 + t}\n\nFor t_1=1, a_{1+0} = a1, a_{1+1}=a2, ..., a_{1 + (H-1)} = a_H\n\nBut a_H is the action at turn H, which sets y_{H+1}.\n\nBut I need to be at y_H=9 at turn H.\n\nSo action a_H should not be necessary if I am already at 9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nPerhaps the actions are for the turns when I move.\n\nFrom the position update: I start at turn t_1, position given.\n\nThen I perform action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, position y_{t_1 +1}, choose a_{t_1 +1}, and so on, until at turn t_1 + H -1, I am at position (0,9), so I don't perform action at that turn if I stop.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -2? Let's see.\n\nThe minimal H such that at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nFor example, at turn t_1, position given, after 0 actions.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn t_1 +1, position y_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k, position.\n\nI need position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be (0,9).\n\nSo after H-1 actions, at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nWith y_{t_1} =0, set y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nNumber of actions: H-1.\n\nActions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -2.\n\nFor t_1=1, actions from turn 1 to turn (1 + H -2) = H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, it says {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, which would be a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, but that is H actions, which would take to turn t_1 + H.\n\nI think there is confusion.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nFor example, with no move, if start at (0,9), then H=1, and no actions, but t from 0 to H-1=0, so t=0, a_{t_1 +0} = a_{t_1}, but if no action, it might be omitted, but in sequence, perhaps for H=1, no actions.\n\nBut here, start at y=0, not 9.\n\nIn general, to reach at turn T, with T = t_1 + H -1, so H-1 = T - t_1.\n\nActions from turn t_1 to turn T-1.\n\nNumber of actions: T - t_1.\n\nFor t_1=1, T=18, actions from turn 1 to 17.\n\nIn the sequence notation, {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nFor t from 0 to H-1, a_{t_1 + t}, so for H=18, t from 0 to 17, a_{1+0} to a_{1+17} = a1 to a18.\n\nBut a18 is action at turn 18, which sets y19, but I am at y18=9, so I don't need a18.\n\nProblem with the indexing.\n\nPerhaps for the turn when I reach, I don't take action.\n\nIn the sequence, actions are only for the turns before reaching.\n\nI think it's better to output actions for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -2.\n\nBut the format says up to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAssume that when I reach at turn t_1 + H -1, I don't take further action, so the actions are for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -2.\n\nBut in the sequence, it includes up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which might be for the turn after.\n\nI think there's a mistake in the problem statement or my understanding.\n\nAnother way: the actions are performed at turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and after H actions, I am at (0,9).\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThen H is number of actions.\n\nBut the turn when I am at (0,9) is t_1 + H.\n\nThen \"at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9\" is not consistent.\n\nLet's see the problem.\n\n\" at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAnd \"sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nFor t from 0 to H-1, a_{t_1 + t}, which is a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nNow, action a_t is chosen at turn t, sets y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, choose a_t, set y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, position y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, position y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThat means I am at 9 at the start of turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen I may or may not take action, but since I am at 9, I can stop.\n\nThe actions are from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -2, to set y_{t_1 +1} to y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1, I choose a_{t_1} to set y_{t_1 +1}\n\nAt turn t_1 +1, choose a_{t_1 +1} to set y_{t_1 +2}, ..., at turn t_1 + H -2, choose a_{t_1 + H -2} to set y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H -1, I am at y=9, and no action needed for that turn.\n\nBut in the sequence, it includes a_{t_1 + H -1}, which would be for turn t_1 + H -1, setting y_{t_1 + H}, which is after I reached.\n\nSo for the last turn, when I am at 9, I don't take action, so a_{t_1 + H -1} should not be included.\n\nBut the sequence says up to a_{t_1 + H -1} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nI think for simplicity, in this case, since I reach at turn H=18, I need actions from turn 1 to 17.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=18, t from 0 to 17, a1 to a18, but a18 is extra.\n\nPerhaps the action at turn t_1 + H -1 is not needed, so for H, the number of actions is H-1, but H is called number of turns.\n\nI think I should proceed with the plan.\n\nBack to the game.\n\nTo avoid collision, I stay at y=0 until T=9.\n\nThen go up.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 1: S (stay, y2=0)\n\nTurn 2: S (y3=0)\n\nTurn 3: S (y4=0)\n\nTurn 4: S (y5=0)\n\nTurn 5: S (y6=0)\n\nTurn 6: S (y7=0)\n\nTurn 7: S (y8=0)  // at T=8 y=0\n\nTurn 8: S (y9=0)  // at T=9 y=0\n\nNow from here, go up:\n\nTurn 9: U (y10=1)\n\nTurn 10: U (y11=2)\n\nTurn 11: U (y12=3)\n\nTurn 12: U (y13=4)\n\nTurn 13: U (y14=5)\n\nTurn 14: U (y15=6)\n\nTurn 15: U (y16=7)\n\nTurn 16: U (y17=8)\n\nTurn 17: U (y18=9)\n\nAt turn 18, y=9.\n\nH is such that at turn t_1 + H -1 =1 + H -1 =H, y_H=9, so H=18.\n\nActions from turn 1 to turn 17, but in the sequence, it should be a1 to a17 for turns 1 to 17.\n\nIn the output, for t from 0 to H-1=17, a_{1+t} for t=0 to 17, which is a1 to a18, but a18 is not needed.\n\nPerhaps for turn 17, a17=U sets y18=9, so at turn 18, I am at y=9, so action at turn 17 is included.\n\nAnd for turn 18, no action.\n\nIn the sequence up to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{1+17} =a18, but a18 would be for turn 18, which is after I reached.\n\nI think it's a off-by-one.\n\nTo match the format, I'll include actions up to the one that sets y to 9.\n\nIn this case, a17 sets y18=9, so actions from a1 to a17.\n\nFor H=18, t from 0 to 17, a_{1+t} for t=0 to 17, that's 18 actions, but a1 to a18.\n\na18 sets y19, not needed.\n\nI think I should set H such that turn t_1 + H -1 is when I am at 9, and actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -2.\n\nBut in the sequence, it includes up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which is one too many.\n\nFor this problem, since I need to output the sequence, I'll output only the necessary actions.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is smaller.\n\nAnother idea: I can be at y=9 at T=10, but at T=9 I am on y=8, which is unsafe, but the collision condition is only if I am on the freeway at that turn, and 0 in span.\n\nAt T=9, y=8, row 8 is unsafe at T=9, so collision, I cannot.\n\nUnless I move in a way that at T=8 and T=9 I am not on freeway, but I can't for T=10 arrival.\n\nSo I think T=18 is the earliest without collision.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at T=11 or something, but let's see.\n\nSuppose I am at y=9 at T=11.\n\nThen at T=10, I must be at y=8 or y=9.\n\nIf at T=10 y=8, then row 8 at T=10 is safe, since unsafe only at 2,3,8,9, T=10 not.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, I need to be at y=8 or y=9 or y=7, etc, but at T=9, if I am on freeway, unsafe.\n\nSo for T=11, y11=9.\n\nThen at T=10, y10 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y10=9, then I am at 9 at T=10, but we want T=11.\n\nIf y10=8, then at T=10, y=8, which is safe for T=10.\n\nBut at T=9, y9 must be 7,8,9 to go to y10=8.\n\nIf y9=8, then at T=9, y=8, row8 unsafe at T=9, collision.\n\nIf y9=7, then at T=9, y=7, row7 unsafe at T=9, collision.\n\nIf y9=9, then at T=9, y=9, safe, but then y10=9, so not to y10=8.\n\nSo to have y10=8, y9 must be 7,8, or9, all at T=9 on freeway if not 9, but y=9 not for y10=8.\n\nSo at T=9, I must be on freeway to reach y10=8, but unsafe, collision.\n\nSimilarly for any T between 2 and 9, except if I am at y=0 or y=9 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut for T=11, I can only reach if I avoid being on freeway at T=9, but at T=9, to be at y=9 or y=0.\n\nIf at T=9 y=0, then to reach y=9 at T=11, I need to go up quickly, but from y=0 at T=9 to y=9 at T=11, impossible, since in two actions, I can go to y=2 at best.\n\ny9=0, a9=U, y10=1, a10=U, y11=2, not 9.\n\nSo I cannot reach y=9 before T=10, and at T=10, y10=9, but at T=9, I am at y=8 or something, unsafe.\n\nIf I reach at T=10, y10=9.\n\nThen at T=9, y9 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y9=9, then I am at 9 at T=9, safe.\n\nBut to be at y9=9, I need to arrive earlier, but minimal T=10 for y10=9.\n\ny9=9 means at turn 9, I am at 9, so arrived earlier.\n\nFor example, if I am at y=9 at T=9, that requires y9=9, with actions before.\n\nBut as before, impossible before T=10.\n\ny9=9: from y1=0, with 8 actions, sum Δy =9, impossible, max y9=8.\n\nSo y9 cannot be 9.\n\nTherefore, at T=9, if I am on freeway, it is unsafe, and I cannot be at y=9.\n\nSo for any path to y=9 at T, for T=10 to 17, at T=9 I must be on freeway (since y=9 not possible), so collision at T=9.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, if not at y=0 or 9, collision.\n\nBut at T=8, y=9 impossible, so must be at y=0.\n\nThen at T=9, must be at y=0 or 9, y=9 impossible, so at y=0.\n\nThen go up.\n\nSo no choice, must be at y=0 at T=8 and T=9, then reach at T=18.\n\nSo minimal H=18.\n\nActions: for turns 1 to 8: S (stay at 0)\n\nThen turns 9 to 17: U (up to 9)\n\nSpecifically:\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S  // after this, at turn 9 y=0\n\nThen Turn 9: U  // to y=1 at turn 10\n\nTurn 10: U  // y=2 at 11\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 17: U  // to y=9 at turn 18\n\nAt turn 18, y=9.\n\nNumber of turns H=18.\n\nActions from turn 1 to 17.\n\nIn sequence:\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: S\n\n...\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nFor the answer, I need to box it.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nSuppose I go up during safe times and down before T=8.\n\nFor example, at T=7, I am at y=1, as I thought earlier.\n\nHow to be at y=1 at T=7.\n\nFor instance:\n\nT=1 y=0, a1=U, y2=1\n\nT=2 y=1\n\nThen I can stay or move, but to be at y=1 at T=7, I need to not move much.\n\nSay a2=S, y3=1\n\na3=S, y4=1\n\n...\n\na6=S, y7=1\n\nThen at T=7 y=1\n\na7=D, y8=0\n\na8=S, y9=0\n\nThen a9=U, y10=1\n\netc, to a17=U, y18=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf I go higher, say to y=4 at some point, but I have to come down, and at T=8 I might not be at y=0, but as before, I can only be at y=1, which at T=8 is unsafe.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nThus, the minimal is to stay at 0 until T=9, then go up.\n\nH=18.\n\nNow for the car state, I think I covered all.\n\nIn freeway 5-8, there is a car at T=2,3, but I am not on them at that time.\n\nIn the path, when I go up from T=9, at T=10 y=1, which is safe, etc.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo I think this is the plan.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 18. This means the player reaches (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 1 + 18 - 1 = 18\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions must ensure that the player is not on any freeway (i.e., not at \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)) during turns 8 and 9, as all freeways are unsafe at these times due to car collisions. Specifically:\n- At turn 8, all freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are unsafe because cars cover position \\(x = 0\\).\n- At turn 9, all freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are similarly unsafe.\n\nTo avoid collisions, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y = 9\\) during turns 8 and 9. Since reaching \\(y = 9\\) by turn 9 is impossible (as it requires at least 9 up actions from turn 1, and the maximum \\(y\\) achievable by turn 9 is 8), the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) during turns 8 and 9.\n\nThe strategy is:\n- Stay at \\(y = 0\\) from turn 1 to turn 9 by choosing action \"S\" (stay) for turns 1 through 8. This ensures the player is at \\(y = 0\\) during turns 8 and 9, avoiding collisions.\n- From turn 9 onwards, move up (\"U\") every turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 18.\n\nThe action sequence for turns \\(t = t_1 + \\tau\\) for \\(\\tau = 0\\) to \\(H-1 = 17\\) (i.e., turns 1 to 18) is:\n- Turns 1 to 8: \"S\" to remain at \\(y = 0\\).\n- Turns 9 to 17: \"U\" to increase \\(y\\) from 0 to 9.\n\nAfter action \\(a_{17} = U\\) at turn 17, the position at turn 18 is \\(y_{18} = 9\\).\n\n### Verification:\n- **Collision avoidance**:\n  - Turns 1-7: Player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no freeway).\n  - Turn 8: Player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n  - Turn 9: Player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n  - Turns 10-17: Player moves through freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), but these turns are safe for all rows:\n    - Rows 1-4 are unsafe only at turns 1, 8, 9; turns 10-17 are safe.\n    - Rows 5-8 are unsafe only at turns 2, 3, 8, 9; turns 10-17 are safe.\n- **Position at turn 18**: After 17 actions, \\(y_{18} = 0 + \\sum \\Delta y = 0 + (8 \\times 0) + (9 \\times 1) = 9\\).\n\nThis path achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 18\\) turns, as any attempt to reach \\(y = 9\\) earlier would result in collision at turn 8 or 9.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 1: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,0) at turn t1=2 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway from y=1 to y=8. For each freeway, there are cars defined by their head, tail, direction, and speed. All cars seem to be moving right with speed 6, based on the data.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: two cars: (-36, -47, right, 6) and (12, 1, right, 6)\n\n- Freeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6)\n\n- Freeway 3: same\n\n- Freeway 4: same\n\n- Freeway 5: three cars: (-36, -47, right, 6), (0, -11, right, 6), (36, 25, right, 6)\n\n- Freeway 6: same as freeway 5\n\n- Freeway 7: same\n\n- Freeway 8: same\n\nFor freeways 1-4, it's the same two cars. For 5-8, it's the same three cars.\n\nThe collision happens if at turn T, when the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe player is on a freeway only when they are moving to it or staying? Let's read the note carefully.\n\n\"Note that if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, when you take an action, you are on y_T during that turn. If you move to a different row, you are only on that new row starting from the next turn.\n\nCollision is checked based on the position at turn T: if y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, at turn T, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nThe car span at turn T depends on the initial state at t1 and the time elapsed.\n\nt1 is given as turn 2. So, at any turn T, the time elapsed since t1 is (T - t1) = (T - 2).\n\nFor a car, at turn T, the span is:\n\nFor left-moving: [h - s(T - t1), τ - s(T - t1)] but all cars here are right-moving, so direction right.\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]\n\nIn the car state, for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h] and then Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for example, freeway 1: cars: (-36, -47, right, 6) and (12, 1, right, 6)\n\nFor the first car: head h = -36, tail τ = -47? That seems odd because usually head should be ahead, but since it's moving right, and tail is less than head? Let's see the notation.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], and then Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For the first car: head h = -36, tail τ = -47.\n\nSince direction is right, and tail τ = -47, head h = -36, so τ < h, so the car is from left to right, so span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-47, -36]? But that would be from -47 to -36, which is moving right.\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-47 + 6(T-2), -36 + 6(T-2)]\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nBut the collision condition is that 0 is in the span at turn T for some car on that freeway.\n\n0 is the x-position where the player is, since player is always at x=0.\n\nPlayer is at (0, y_t), so x=0 always.\n\nSo for collision: at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, and for freeway y_T, there is a car such that 0 is between the left and right ends of its span at turn T.\n\nFor right-moving car, span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving right, the left end is τ + s(T-t1), right end is h + s(T-t1), and since τ < h for right-moving, left < right.\n\nIn this case, for car with τ and h, if τ < h, then left = τ + s(T-t1), right = h + s(T-t1).\n\n0 is in span if left <= 0 <= right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right-moving here.\n\nNow, t1=2.\n\nI need to find actions from turn 2 onwards to reach y=9 quickly.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nSo we start at y=0 at turn 2.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be to go up as fast as possible, but we have to avoid the cars when on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so from y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 moves, but we might need to wait or go down sometimes to avoid collisions.\n\nSince we start at turn 2, and we need to output actions for turns starting from t1=2.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, but t is relative to t1, so actions a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn the answer format, it's Turn t1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, etc.\n\nSo for turn 2, 3, 4, etc.\n\nNow, let's understand the car positions over time.\n\nFirst, since all cars move at speed 6 per turn, and t1=2.\n\nAt any turn T, the time since t1 is Δt = T - 2.\n\nThen for each car, the span at T is [τ + 6*Δt, h + 6*Δt] for right-moving cars.\n\nNow, for freeways 1-4, there are two cars each.\n\nLet's take freeway 1 as example.\n\nCar A: τ = -47, h = -36\n\nCar B: τ = 1, h = 12? In the table it says (12,1,right,6), so for this car, head=12, tail=1? Since direction right, and tail=1, head=12, so τ=1, h=12.\n\nSimilarly, first car: head=-36, tail=-47, so τ=-47, h=-36.\n\nNow, span at T:\n\nFor car A: left = -47 + 6*(T-2), right = -36 + 6*(T-2)\n\nFor car B: left = 1 + 6*(T-2), right = 12 + 6*(T-2)\n\n0 is in span if for car A: left <= 0 <= right, i.e., -47 + 6*(T-2) <= 0 <= -36 + 6*(T-2)\n\nSimilarly for car B: 1 + 6*(T-2) <= 0 <= 12 + 6*(T-2)\n\nBut since 1 + 6*(T-2) is at least 1 when T=2, and increases, so 1 + 6*(T-2) >=1 >0, so 0 <= left, but 0 < left since left >=1, so 0 cannot be <= left, so for car B, 0 is never in span because left starts at 1 and increases.\n\nAt T=2, for car B: left = 1 + 6*(0) =1, right=12, so span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nAs T increases, left and right increase, so 0 is always less than left, so never in span for car B.\n\nSimilarly for car A: at T=2, left = -47 +0 = -47, right= -36, so span [-47,-36], which includes numbers from -47 to -36, all negative, so 0 is greater than right? -36 <0, so 0 > right, so 0 not in span.\n\nNow, when does car A have 0 in span?\n\nleft <= 0 <= right\n\n-47 + 6*(T-2) <= 0 <= -36 + 6*(T-2)\n\nFirst inequality: -47 + 6*(T-2) <= 0 => 6*(T-2) <= 47 => T-2 <= 47/6 = 7.833, so T <= 9.833, since T integer, T <=9\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -36 + 6*(T-2) => 36 <= 6*(T-2) => 6 <= T-2 => T >= 8\n\nSo for T from 8 to 9 inclusive, 0 is in span of car A on freeway 1.\n\nT=8: Δt=6, left = -47 + 36 = -11, right= -36 +36=0, so [-11,0], 0 is included? 0 <= right, which is 0, so yes, 0 in span.\n\nT=9: Δt=7, left= -47 +42= -5, right= -36+42=6, so [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nT=10: left= -47+48=1, right= -36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, car A causes collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nCar B never has 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly for freeways 2,3,4, same cars, so same situation: at T=8 and T=9, collision on y=1,2,3,4.\n\nNow freeways 5-8 have three cars each.\n\nFreeway 5: cars: (-36,-47,right,6), (0,-11,right,6), (36,25,right,6)\n\nFirst car: τ=-47, h=-36, same as before.\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, direction right, so τ=-11, h=0? Span at t1: [τ,h] = [-11,0]\n\nThird car: head=36, tail=25, so τ=25, h=36? Span [25,36]\n\nNow at turn T, with Δt = T-2.\n\nCar 1: left = -47 + 6*(T-2), right = -36 + 6*(T-2)\n\nCar 2: left = -11 + 6*(T-2), right = 0 + 6*(T-2) = 6*(T-2)\n\nCar 3: left = 25 + 6*(T-2), right = 36 + 6*(T-2)\n\nNow, when is 0 in span for each.\n\nFirst, car 1: same as before, 0 in span when T=8 and T=9.\n\nCar 2: left <= 0 <= right\n\n-11 + 6*(T-2) <= 0 <= 6*(T-2)\n\nFirst: -11 + 6*(T-2) <= 0 => 6*(T-2) <= 11 => T-2 <= 11/6 ≈1.833, T<=3.833, so T<=3\n\nSecond: 0 <= 6*(T-2) => T-2 >=0 => T>=2\n\nSo at T=2 and T=3, 0 is in span.\n\nT=2: Δt=0, left=-11, right=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=3: Δt=1, left=-11+6=-5, right=0+6=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nT=4: Δt=2, left=-11+12=1, right=6, [1,6], 0 not in.\n\nCar 3: left =25 +6*(T-2), which at T=2 is 25>0, and increases, so always left >0, so 0 < left, not in span.\n\nSimilarly for car 1, only T=8,9.\n\nSo for freeway 5, collisions at:\n\n- From car 2: at T=2 and T=3\n\n- From car 1: at T=8 and T=9\n\nCar 3 never.\n\nSimilarly for freeways 6,7,8, same.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the turns when collision occurs at x=0.\n\ny=1: freeway 1, collision at T=8,9\n\ny=2: same as y=1, T=8,9\n\ny=3: same, T=8,9\n\ny=4: same, T=8,9\n\ny=5: freeway 5, collision at T=2,3 (from car2) and T=8,9 (from car1)\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8 same.\n\ny=5: at T=2 and T=3, and T=8,9\n\nNow, player starts at turn T=2, position y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 is safe, no freeway.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8 have collisions at certain turns.\n\nThe player must not be on a freeway row during a turn when that row has collision.\n\nAt turn T, if y_T = k for k=1 to 8, and if collision on k at T, then crash.\n\nIf y_T =0 or 9, no crash.\n\nAlso, when moving, if at turn T, you are on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1}, you are not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1.\n\nTo minimize turns, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a row when collision happens.\n\nStart at T=2, y=0.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal path might be to go up every turn, but we have to check if we hit a collision.\n\nGo up from y=0 to y=1 at some turn.\n\nBut at T=2, if we go to y=1, we are on y=1 at turn T=2.\n\nBut for y=1, collision only at T=8,9, not at T=2, so at T=2, y=1 is safe? For y=1, which is freeway 1, collision only at T=8,9, so at T=2, no collision on y=1.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5, at T=2, there is collision from car2.\n\nBut we are on y=1 at T=2, not y=5.\n\nSo let's plan the path.\n\nWe start at T=2, y=0.\n\nAt turn T=2, we take an action.\n\nIf we take U, we go to y=1 at turn T=3? No.\n\nPlayer update: at turn T, action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThe position is given for turn t, and action a_t determines the change for the next position.\n\nAt turn t, position is (0, y_t)\n\nThen action a_t: if U, y_{t+1} = y_t +1\n\nIf D, y_{t+1} = y_t -1\n\nIf S, y_{t+1} = y_t\n\nAnd y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]\n\nThen at turn t+1, position is (0, y_{t+1})\n\nCollision at turn t if y_t is between 1 and 8, and for freeway y_t, 0 in some car span at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, we are on row y_t.\n\nFor example, at start, turn t=2, y_2 = 0, so on row 0, no collision possible.\n\nWe take action a_2, which will determine y_3.\n\nThen at turn t=3, we are at y_3, and so on.\n\nWe need to reach y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so after H actions, we are at position after H steps.\n\nLet’s say we start at turn T_start = t1 =2, position y=0.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn 2, y=0.\n\nAfter first action (at turn 2), at turn 3, y= something.\n\nGenerally, after k actions, at turn 2+k.\n\nWe want for some K, at turn 2+K, y_{2+K} =9.\n\nAnd K should be minimal.\n\nThe number of turns from start: we take H actions, from turn 2 to turn 2+H-1, and at turn 2+H, we are at position after H actions.\n\nSet T = turn number.\n\nAt T=2, y=0.\n\nAction a_2 determines y_3.\n\nAction a_3 determines y_4, and so on.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T >=2.\n\nSince we start at T=2, y=0, and each move changes y by at most 1, the earliest we can reach y=9 is at T=11, if we go up every turn: T=2 y=0, a2=U, T=3 y=1, a3=U, T=4 y=2, ..., up to T=11 y=9.\n\ny at T: after k up moves, y_{2+k} = k.\n\nTo have y=9, k=9, so at T=11, y=9.\n\nWith 9 up moves starting from turn 2.\n\nActions from turn 2 to turn 10: a2 to a10, with each U, then at turn 11, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 2 to turn 10, that's 9 actions? Turn t actions: a_t for t=2 to 10, 9 actions, position from y2 to y11.\n\ny2=0, after a2 (U), y3=1, ..., after a10 (U), y11=9.\n\nSo H=9 actions, from t=2 to t=10, and at t=11, we reach y=9.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions during the path.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=1 at T=3, y=2 at T=4, ..., y=8 at T=10, and y=9 at T=11.\n\nNow, at each turn, when on freeway, check collision.\n\nFirst, at T=3, y=1. Freeway 1, collision only at T=8,9, not at T=3, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=4, y=2, freeway 2, same, no collision at T=4.\n\nT=5, y=3, freeway 3, safe.\n\nT=6, y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nT=7, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nNow at T=7, y=5.\n\nFreeway 5 has collisions at T=2,3 and T=8,9.\n\nT=7 not in {2,3,8,9}, so no collision at T=7.\n\nSimilarly, T=8, y=6? In the path: at T=7, y=5; a7=U, so y8=6.\n\nAt T=8, y=6.\n\nFreeway 6, which is like y=5-8, collisions at T=2,3 and T=8,9.\n\nT=8 is collision for freeway 6.\n\ny=6 at T=8, freeway 6, collision at T=8? Yes, from car1, since for y=6, same as freeway 5, collision at T=8.\n\nSo at T=8, if on y=6, collision occurs.\n\nSimilarly, T=9, y=7, freeway 7, collision at T=9.\n\nIn the direct path:\n\nT=8: y=6, collision\n\nT=9: y=7, collision at T=9\n\nT=10: y=8, freeway 8, collision at T=8 and T=9? For freeway 8, collisions at T=2,3 and T=8,9.\n\nAt T=10, no collision, since T=10 not in {2,3,8,9}.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, we have collision when on y=6 and y=7.\n\nSo direct up path has collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nTherefore, we need to avoid being on freeways 6,7,8 at T=8 and T=9, or on any freeway that has collision at that turn.\n\nSpecifically for y=6 at T=8, y=7 at T=9.\n\nAlso, for y=5 at T=8,9 but in the path we are not on y=5 at those times.\n\nWe need to modify the path to skip those or wait.\n\nSince the collisions are only at specific turns, we can delay or advance the moves.\n\nWe start at T=2, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe critical turns are T=8 and T=9, where multiple freeways have collisions.\n\nFor T=8: freeways 1-4 have collision (from car A), and 5-8 have collision (from car1).\n\nSimilarly T=9: same freeways 1-4 and 5-8 have collision.\n\nAt T=8 and T=9, all freeways y=1 to 8 have collisions because:\n\ny=1-4: collision from car A at T=8,9\n\ny=5-8: collision from car1 at T=8,9 and also from car2 at T=2,3 but not relevant for T=8,9.\n\nAt T=8 and T=9, for every freeway y=1 to 8, there is a car with 0 in span, so collision if on any of them.\n\nTherefore, at turns T=8 and T=9, the player must not be on any freeway row, i.e., must be on y=0 or y=9.\n\nSimilarly, for other turns, only specific rows have issues.\n\nFor example, at T=2 and T=3, for freeways 5-8, there is collision from car2.\n\nBut we start at T=2, y=0, so not on freeway.\n\nAt T=3, if we are on y=5,6,7, or8, collision, but we might not be there yet.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nTo avoid collision at T=8 and T=9, we must be on y=0 or y=9 at those turns.\n\nSince we start from y=0, and need to reach y=9, we might be on y=9 by T=8 or earlier, or on y=0 at T=8 and then go up later.\n\nBut we want minimal turns, so being on y=9 early is good.\n\nThe earliest we can be on y=9 is T=11 with 9 up moves, but as we saw, at T=8 and T=9 we are on y=6 and y=7, which are freeways with collision.\n\nWe need to adjust.\n\nOne way is to reach y=9 before T=8.\n\nBut from T=2 to T=8, that's 6 turns (T=3 to T=8), we can go up 6 times, from y=0 to y=6 at T=8.\n\nBut at T=8, if y=6, collision, and y=6 is not 9.\n\nMax we can be at T=8 is y=6 if we go up every turn from T=2 to T=7: T=2 y=0, a2=U, T=3 y=1, a3=U, T=4 y=2, ..., a7=U, T=8 y=6.\n\nBut at T=8, y=6, collision.\n\nIf we go faster, but we can only move one per turn, so y=6 is max at T=8.\n\ny=0 at T=2, after one up, y=1 at T=3, after two, y=2 at T=4, ..., after k up, y=k at T=2+k.\n\nSo at T=8, 2+k=8, k=6, y=6.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, y=7 max if we go up.\n\nBut at T=8, we must not be on freeway, so y must be 0 or 9.\n\nBut at T=8, y=9 is impossible since from y=0 in 6 moves, max y=6.\n\nSo we must be on y=0 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, must be on y=0 or y=9.\n\nIf we are on y=0 at T=8, then we can go up later.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 eventually.\n\nNow, being on y=0 at T=8 means we stay low or go down before T=8.\n\nSimilarly for T=9.\n\nSince T=8 and T=9 both critical, we should be on y=0 at both turns, or on y=9 at both, but y=9 at T=8 impossible.\n\nSo likely on y=0 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nThen after that, go up to y=9.\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\nFirst, from start to T=8.\n\nWe need to be at y=0 at T=8.\n\nStart at T=2, y=0.\n\nWe have turns T=2 to T=7 to move, but at T=8 position is after action at T=7.\n\ny at T is determined.\n\nAt T=8, we want y_8 =0.\n\ny_8 is the position at turn 8.\n\nActions from turn 2 to turn 7 affect y_3 to y_8.\n\nSpecifically, y_8 depends on actions from a2 to a7.\n\na2 to a7: 6 actions to go from y_2=0 to y_8.\n\ny_8 can be from 0 to 6, depending on net moves.\n\nBut we want y_8=0.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, we also want y_9=0, to avoid collision.\n\nThen after that, go up to y=9.\n\nBut let's see the constraints.\n\nAlso, during the path, we need to avoid collisions at other times.\n\nFor example, at T=3, if we are on y=5,6,7,8, collision.\n\nSimilarly at T=2, but T=2 we are on y=0, safe.\n\nFirst, let's plan to be at y=0 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSo y_8=0 and y_9=0.\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy_8, so if y_8=0, and y_9=0, then we must have Δy_8=0, so action a8=S.\n\nSimilarly, y_8=0.\n\nNow, from start T=2, y_2=0.\n\nWe need to reach y_8=0.\n\nThe net displacement from T=2 to T=8 should be zero.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,1.\n\nFrom turn 2 to turn 8, there are 6 actions: a2 to a7, which determine y3 to y8.\n\ny_8 = y_2 + sum_{t=2 to7} Δy_t = 0 + sum of Δy for t=2 to7.\n\nWe need y_8=0, so sum of Δy from t=2 to t=7 must be zero.\n\nThat means the net moves over 6 actions must be zero.\n\nThen at T=9, y_9 = y_8 + Δy_8 = 0 + 0 if a8=S.\n\nThen we can start going up from T=9 onwards.\n\nBut at T=9, we are at y=0, safe.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9, which takes at least 9 up moves, but we can start from T=9.\n\nAfter y_9=0, we take actions to go up.\n\nEach up move increases y by one.\n\nSo to reach y=9, we need 9 up moves from there.\n\nAt T=9, y=0.\n\nAfter a9, y10 = something, ..., after a17, y18=9? Let's see.\n\nAt T=9, y9=0.\n\na9=U, then y10=1\n\na10=U, y11=2\n\n...\n\nup to a17=U, y18=9\n\nThat would be 9 actions from a9 to a17, with y from 0 to 9 at T=18.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9 we are safe, but this is slower, since we reach at T=18, whereas the direct path was T=11 but with collision.\n\nWe can reach earlier if we go up before, but we have to avoid the critical turns.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to stay at y=0 for both T=8 and T=9, but since at T=9 we also need to be safe, and y=9 might not be reachable, so y=0 is easier.\n\nBut let's see if we can be on y=9 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at T=9.\n\nFrom start T=2, y=0, to T=9, y=9.\n\nThat requires net +9 in 7 moves (from T=2 to T=9, actions a2 to a8 determine y3 to y9).\n\ny9 = y2 + sum_{t=2 to8} Δy_t = 0 + sum Δy for t=2 to8.\n\n7 actions (t=2 to t=8 inclusive), but Δy for each action.\n\nNumber of actions from t=2 to t=8: 7 actions (a2 to a8), which determine y3 to y9.\n\ny9 = y2 + (Δy2 + Δy3 + ... + Δy8)\n\nTo have y9=9, we need sum_{i=2 to8} Δy_i =9.\n\nSince each Δy <=1, we need all U, no S or D, so 7 up moves, but 7 moves can only increase by 7, to y9=7, not 9.\n\ny2=0, after 7 up moves: at T=3 y=1, T=4 y=2, ..., T=9 y=7.\n\nSo at T=9, y=7 max, which is freeway 7, and at T=9, collision, so not safe.\n\nCannot reach y=9 by T=9.\n\nSimilarly, earliest y=9 is T=11 with 9 up moves.\n\nAt T=11, y=9, safe.\n\nBut between, we have T=8 and T=9 where we must not be on freeway.\n\nIn the direct up path, at T=8 we are on y=6, at T=9 on y=7, both bad.\n\nSo we need to not be on freeway at T=8 and T=9.\n\nThat means at T=8, y8 must be 0 or 9.\n\nBut y8=9 impossible, so y8 must be 0.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, y9 must be 0 or 9.\n\nIf y8=0, then y9 could be 0 or 1, depending on action.\n\nBut to be safe, if y9=0, then a8=S.\n\nOr if we can be at y9=9, but impossible as above.\n\nSo y9 must be 0 or 9, but 9 impossible, so y9 must be 0.\n\nTherefore, we must have y8=0 and y9=0, with a8=S.\n\nNow, from start, to have y8=0.\n\ny8 = position at turn 8.\n\ny8 depends on actions from a2 to a7.\n\ny2=0.\n\ny3 = y2 + Δy2\n\ny4 = y3 + Δy3 = y2 + Δy2 + Δy3\n\n...\n\ny8 = y2 + Δy2 + Δy3 + ... + Δy7\n\nSet y8=0, so Δy2 + Δy3 + ... + Δy7 = 0\n\nThat is, the net change over 6 actions (a2 to a7) is zero.\n\nSimilarly, for y9=0, since y9 = y8 + Δy8 = 0 + Δy8, so Δy8=0, a8=S.\n\nThen after that, we need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom T=9, y=0, we can go up with 9 up moves: a9 to a17 all U, then at T=18, y=9.\n\nBut that takes many turns: from T=2 to T=18, 16 actions? Let's count turns.\n\nStart T=2, actions a2 to a17 for 16 actions? No.\n\nActions from turn t=2 to t=17, that's 16 actions, position up to y18.\n\nBut we can reach earlier if during the first phase, we go up and down but net zero, so we are not stuck at zero.\n\nIn the net zero phase, we can be at higher y but come back to zero by T=8.\n\nThen from T=9, go up directly.\n\nBut during the net zero phase, we need to avoid collisions at other times.\n\nFor example, at T=3, we might be on a high row with collision.\n\nSimilarly, for T=2,3 on y=5-8.\n\nNow, let's list the collision times for each row.\n\nFor each freeway row, the turns when collision occurs:\n\ny=1: collision at T=8,9\n\ny=2: same, T=8,9\n\ny=3: same, T=8,9\n\ny=4: same, T=8,9\n\ny=5: collision at T=2,3 and T=8,9\n\ny=6: same, T=2,3 and T=8,9\n\ny=7: same, T=2,3 and T=8,9\n\ny=8: same, T=2,3 and T=8,9\n\nAlso, at T=2 and T=3, only y=5-8 have collision, y=1-4 are safe at those times.\n\nAt T=8,9, all y=1-8 have collision.\n\nOther turns, no collision for any row, except possibly if other cars, but from above, only T=2,3 for y=5-8 and T=8,9 for all.\n\nFor example, at T=4, is there collision on any row?\n\nFor y=1: car A, left at T=4: -47 +6*(4-2) = -47+12= -35, right= -36+12= -24, [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nCar B: left=1+12=13>0, not.\n\nSimilarly y=2-4 same.\n\ny=5: car1: left= -47+12= -35, right=-24, not 0.\n\ncar2: left= -11+12=1, right=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\ncar3: left=25+12=37>0, not.\n\nSimilarly for other T, only T=2,3 and T=8,9 have collisions.\n\nSo for turns other than 2,3,8,9, all freeways are safe, no collision.\n\nAt T=2 and T=3, only freeways y=5,6,7,8 have collision.\n\nAt T=8 and T=9, all y=1 to 8 have collision.\n\nNow back to planning.\n\nWe need y8=0 and y9=0.\n\nFrom T=2 to T=8, with y8=0, net zero over 6 actions.\n\nDuring this period, we must avoid being on y=5,6,7,8 at T=2 or T=3? But at T=2, we start at y2=0, so not on freeway.\n\nAt T=3, if we are on y=5,6,7,8, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, we are on y=0, safe.\n\nAt T=9, on y=0.\n\nOther turns are safe for all rows.\n\nSo the only critical point is at T=3, we must not be on y=5,6,7,8.\n\nBecause at T=3, if on those, collision.\n\nAt T=2, we are on y=0, safe.\n\nNow, at T=3, position y3.\n\ny3 = y2 + Δy2 = 0 + Δy2\n\nSince Δy2 can be -1,0,1, so y3 can be -1,0,1? But y must be in [0,9], so y3 cannot be -1.\n\nΔy: if D, y decreases only if y>0, similarly.\n\ny2=0, so action a2: if U, y3=1; if D, y3=0 (since cannot go below 0, I assume? The player update says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, Δy_t = -1, but y_{t+1} = -1 not in [0,9], so probably not allowed, or it clamps.\n\nThe game dynamics: \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\", so I think it must stay within bounds, so if y_t=0, cannot go down, similarly y_t=9 cannot go up.\n\nSo at y=0, action D is invalid or same as S? Probably action D when y=0 has no effect, y_{t+1}=0.\n\nSimilarly for y=9, U has no effect.\n\nIn the Δy definition, it might be implicitly handled, but to be safe, assume that actions are only allowed if the new position is valid, or it stays.\n\nBut in the problem, it says \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\", so we must have actions such that new y is within bounds.\n\nSo for y_t=0, possible actions: U (y_{t+1}=1), S (y_{t+1}=0), D not possible or y_{t+1}=0.\n\nSimilarly for y=9.\n\nIn the action set, we can choose, but if we choose D at y=0, it might be invalid or no change.\n\nTo avoid issue, we should only choose actions that keep y within bounds.\n\nSo at y=0, only U or S.\n\nAt y=9, only D or S.\n\nBack to T=3.\n\nAt T=3, y3 must not be 5,6,7,8 to avoid collision.\n\ny3 can be 0,1,2,3,4 or 9, but from y2=0, with one action, y3 can only be 0 or 1.\n\nIf a2=S, y3=0\n\nIf a2=U, y3=1\n\nSo y3=0 or 1, both safe since 0 is not freeway, and 1 is freeway but at T=3, y=1 has no collision, only y=5-8 have at T=3.\n\ny=1 at T=3 is safe.\n\nSimilarly y=0 safe.\n\nSo at T=3, no problem, since y3=0 or 1, both ok.\n\nThen we have from T=3 to T=8, with actions a3 to a7, to have y8=0.\n\ny8 = y3 + sum_{t=3 to7} Δy_t\n\ny3 is 0 or 1.\n\nWe need y8=0.\n\nAlso, during this, we need to avoid being on high rows at T=3, but T=3 is already past, and we are at low y.\n\nOther turns are safe except T=8,9 which we handle.\n\nT=8 we will be at y=0.\n\nNow, the net change from T=3 to T=8 must be such that y8=0.\n\ny8 = y3 + sum_{t=3 to7} Δy_t = 0\n\nSo sum Δy from t=3 to t=7 must be -y3.\n\nIf y3=0, then sum Δy_{t=3 to7} =0\n\nIf y3=1, then sum Δy_{t=3 to7} = -1\n\nNumber of actions: a3 to a7, 5 actions.\n\nWe can choose actions to achieve the net change.\n\nThen at T=8, y8=0.\n\na8=S, so y9=0.\n\nThen from T=9, y9=0, we can start going up.\n\nTo reach y=9 as fast as possible, we should go up every turn from there.\n\na9=U, y10=1\n\na10=U, y11=2\n\n...\n\na17=U, y18=9\n\nSo at T=18, y=9.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nPerhaps during the net zero phase, we can go up and be at higher y, but we need to be back to 0 at T=8, so net zero.\n\nBut we can be at y=9 earlier if we go up before T=8, but we have to come back to 0, so it might not save time.\n\nFor example, if we go up to y=9 before T=8, but to be at y=9, we need at least T=11, but at T=8 we need to be at y=0, so we have to come down from 9 to 0 between T=11 and T=8, which is impossible since T=8 before T=11.\n\nTime only forward.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=9 before T=11 anyway.\n\nThe earliest possible to reach y=9 is T=11, but we cannot because of T=8 and T=9.\n\nWith the above, we reach at T=18, which is later.\n\nBut we can reach earlier by not staying at 0 for both, but we have to.\n\nAnother idea: be on y=0 at T=8, then at T=9, instead of staying, we can go up, but at T=9, if we go up, y10=1, but at T=9, we are at y9, which must be 0 or 9 to avoid collision.\n\nIf we are at y8=0, and we do not stay, but go up, then y9=1.\n\nBut at T=9, y9=1, which is freeway 1, and at T=9, collision, so not safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down, y9=0, which is safe, but same as staying.\n\nSo we must have y9=0 or 9, 9 impossible, so y9=0, thus from y8=0, we must have a8=S or D, but D keeps at 0, so a8=S or D, y9=0.\n\nThen only from T=10 we can go up.\n\nSo the above plan seems necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm the number of turns.\n\nStart T=2, y=0.\n\nActions a2 to a7: 6 actions to achieve net zero or whatever, with y8=0.\n\nThen a8=S, y9=0.\n\nThen a9 to a17: 9 actions to go up to y=9 at T=18.\n\nTotal actions from a2 to a17, that's 16 actions? Turns: actions at t=2 to t=17, that's 16 actions.\n\nPosition at T=18, y=9.\n\nBut H is the number of turns from t1, so actions from t=2 to t=2+H-1, and at t=2+H, position.\n\nSo after H actions, at turn 2+H.\n\nWe want y_{2+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 18, y=9, so 2+H=18, H=16.\n\nBut we can reduce H by starting to go up earlier during the net zero phase, but since we need to be at y=0 at T=8, we have to come down, so it might not help.\n\nFor example, if we go up to y=4 at some point, then come back to 0 by T=8, but the number of moves to go up and down is at least the distance, so net zero requires equal up and down, so no gain.\n\nMoreover, we might be able to be at y=9 at T=11 if we can avoid the collision at T=8 and T=9 by being on safe rows, but at T=8 and T=9, no row is safe except 0 and 9.\n\n9 not reachable, so only 0.\n\nSo I think H=16 is the best with this approach.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier by not having net zero but minimizing.\n\nSuppose we are at y=0 at T=8, but at T=9, we are at y=9, impossible.\n\nOr at T=9, we are at y=9, but cannot by T=9.\n\nAnother idea: after T=9, we go up fast, but we need to be safe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nPerhaps we can be on a freeway at T=8 or T=9 if that row has no collision, but at T=8 and T=9, all rows have collision, so no, must be on 0 or 9.\n\nSo I think we have to do it.\n\nBut let's list the actions for the net zero phase.\n\nFirst, at T=2, y2=0.\n\nWe can choose a2.\n\nIf a2=S, y3=0\n\nIf a2=U, y3=1\n\nNow, we need y8=0.\n\nAlso, at T=3, y3=0 or 1, both safe.\n\nSuppose we do a2=U, so y3=1.\n\nThen we need y8 = y3 + sum_{t=3 to7} Δy_t = 1 + sum_{t=3 to7} Δy_t = 0, so sum_{t=3 to7} Δy_t = -1\n\nWith 5 actions, a3 to a7.\n\nNet change -1, so for example, four S and one D, or three U and four D, but we need to go to y=0.\n\nSince y3=1, we need to decrease by 1 over 5 turns.\n\nWe can do, for example, a3=S, a4=S, a5=D, a6=S, a7=S, then y4=y3=1, y5=1, y6=1 + (-1) =0 if a5=D, then y7=0, y8=0.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nStart T=3, y3=1\n\na3=S, y4=1\n\na4=S, y5=1\n\na5=D, y6=0  (since y5=1, D to 0)\n\na6=S, y7=0\n\na7=S, y8=0\n\nYes.\n\nWe could go up and down, but no need.\n\nSimilarly, if we did a2=S, y3=0, then sum_{t=3 to7} Δy_t =0, so for example all S, or some U and D.\n\nBut with y3=0, we can stay at 0 or move around.\n\nBut to save actions later, better to be higher, but since we need net zero, it doesn't matter for the total.\n\nIn this case, with a2=U, we are at y=1 for some turns, which is fine.\n\nThen at T=8, y8=0\n\na8=S, y9=0\n\nThen from T=9, y9=0, a9=U, y10=1\n\na10=U, y11=2\n\na11=U, y12=3\n\na12=U, y13=4\n\na13=U, y14=5\n\na14=U, y15=6\n\na15=U, y16=7\n\na16=U, y17=8\n\na17=U, y18=9\n\nSo at T=18, y=9.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=2 to t=17, that's 16 actions? t from 2 to 17 inclusive is 16 actions.\n\nSince actions for t=2 to t=17, 16 actions, position at t=18.\n\n2+H =18, H=16.\n\nBut we can start going up earlier if in the net zero phase we go up but come down, but it doesn't help the final position.\n\nFor example, if from T=3 y=1, we go up to y=4, then down to y=0 at T=8, but we still reach y=0 at T=8, and then go up from 0, same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at T=11 if we can be on y=9 at T=11, but avoid being on freeway at T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut at T=8, we need to be on y=0 or 9, 9 impossible, so y=0.\n\nSimilarly T=9, y=0 or 9.\n\nIf we are at y=0 at T=8, we cannot be at y=9 at T=11 with only 3 actions; from y=0 to y=9 in 3 actions impossible, min 9 actions.\n\nSo T=11 impossible to reach from T=8 y=0.\n\nThus, minimal H is 16.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can do better by being on y=9 at T=9, impossible.\n\nOr at T=10, y=9.\n\nAt T=10, y=9 is safe.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=10.\n\nFrom start T=2 y=0, to T=10 y=9.\n\nActions a2 to a9 determine y3 to y10.\n\ny10 = y2 + sum_{t=2 to9} Δy_t = 0 + sum_{t=2 to9} Δy_t\n\n8 actions, a2 to a9.\n\nTo have y10=9, sum Δy =9, but 8 actions, max sum 8, so y10=8 max, not 9.\n\nEarliest y=9 is T=11.\n\nAt T=11, y=9 safe.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, we need to be safe.\n\nAt T=8, y8 must be 0 or 9.\n\ny8=9 impossible, so y8=0.\n\nAt T=9, y9 must be 0 or 9.\n\nIf y8=0, and y9=9, then from y8=0 to y9=9 in one action impossible, max y9=1.\n\nSo y9 cannot be 9, must be 0 or 1, but to be safe at T=9, must be 0 or 9, 9 impossible, so must be 0.\n\nThus y9=0.\n\nSo we must have y8=0 and y9=0.\n\nNo other way.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 16, with actions as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, we can choose different actions for the net zero part.\n\nTo minimize time, we should not waste moves, but in this case, we need to have the net zero, so we have to have some S or D.\n\nIn the example above, with a2=U, then we did some S and one D to net -1 from y3=1.\n\nIf we do a2=S, y3=0, then we need sum Δy t=3 to7 =0, so for example all S, then y8=0.\n\nThen from T=9, go up.\n\nBut with a2=S, we stay at 0 for one extra turn, which might delay, but in terms of reaching y=9, it is the same T=18.\n\nWith a2=U, we are at y=1 for a few turns, then down to 0, same.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the action sequence.\n\nAlso, in the net zero phase, we need to make sure no collision at other times, but since only T=2,3,8,9 have issues, and T=2 we are at y=0, T=3 we are at y=0 or 1, safe, T=8 we at y=0, T=9 at y=0, and other turns all rows safe, so no problem.\n\nFor example, at T=4,5,6,7, we can be on any y=1-8, no collision possible.\n\nSo in the sequence, when we go down or up, it's fine.\n\nNow, let's write the sequence.\n\nStart at T=2, y=0.\n\nI choose a2=U, so y3=1\n\nThen to have net -1 from T=3 to T=8 with 5 actions.\n\nFor simplicity, I can do:\n\na3=S, y4=1\n\na4=S, y5=1\n\na5=D, y6=0  (since y5=1, D to 0)\n\na6=S, y7=0\n\na7=S, y8=0\n\nThen a8=S, y9=0\n\nThen a9=U, y10=1\n\na10=U, y11=2\n\na11=U, y12=3\n\na12=U, y13=4\n\na13=U, y14=5\n\na14=U, y15=6\n\na15=U, y16=7\n\na16=U, y17=8\n\na17=U, y18=9\n\nSo actions from turn 2 to 17.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t, action a_t.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nThen at turn 18, position (0,9)\n\nNumber of actions H=16, from t=2 to t=17.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nSuppose we do not stay at y=0 for both T=8 and T=9, but only for one.\n\nFor example, at T=8, y8=0, safe.\n\nAt T=9, we can be on y=9, impossible, or on y=0, or on a freeway but if no collision, but at T=9 all have collision, so must be on 0 or 9.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=0 at T=8, then at T=9, we go up to y=1, but at T=9, y9=1, collision.\n\nNot safe.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H is 16.\n\nBut let's double-check the car positions.\n\nFor example, at T=3, on y=1, is there collision? Freeway 1, at T=3, car A: left= -47+6*1= -41, right=-30, [-41,-30], 0 not in. Car B: left=1+6=7, right=12, not 0. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=5, y=1, etc., no issue.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 5, we do D from y=1 to y=0, but y=0 is not freeway, so no collision.\n\nAll fine.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 faster by going up during the safe periods and avoiding only the critical turns.\n\nFor example, from T=2 to T=7, go up as much as possible.\n\nStart T=2 y=0\n\na2=U, y3=1\n\na3=U, y4=2\n\na4=U, y5=3\n\na5=U, y6=4\n\na6=U, y7=5\n\na7=U, y8=6\n\nBut at T=8, y8=6, which is freeway, and collision, so invalid.\n\nIf at T=7, we are at y=5, then a7=D, so y8=4, but at T=8, y8=4, which is freeway 4, and at T=8, collision, so still bad.\n\ny8=4, freeway 4, collision at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, any y=1-8 at T=8 has collision.\n\nSo must be y8=0.\n\nSimilarly for T=9.\n\nSo I think it's not possible to be on freeway at T=8 or T=9.\n\nThus, the sequence above is correct.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nH=16 actions.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nIn the net zero part, I have some S, which are fine.\n\nTo make it shorter, but cannot.\n\nPerhaps we can have y3=0 instead.\n\na2=S, y3=0\n\nThen need sum t=3 to7 Δy=0, so for example:\n\na3=S, y4=0\n\na4=S, y5=0\n\na5=S, y6=0\n\na6=S, y7=0\n\na7=S, y8=0\n\nThen a8=S, y9=0\n\nThen same up sequence.\n\nBut we stay at 0 for many turns, which is inefficient but same H.\n\nWith a2=U, we move a bit.\n\nBut in terms of turns, same.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nNow, in the output, we need to list for each turn starting from t1=2.\n\nAnd H=16.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbers.\n\nThe sequence is for actions from turn 2 to turn 17, 16 actions.\n\nPosition at turn 18 is (0,9).\n\nIn the task, it says \"reach (0,9)\", and \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so for t=0, a_{t1}, t=1, a_{t1+1}, ..., up to t=H-1, a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nThen after H actions, at turn t1 + H, position.\n\nSet t1=2.\n\nSo actions: for t=0 to H-1, a_{2+t}\n\nThen at turn 2 + H, position.\n\nWe want position at 2+H to be (0,9)\n\nIn our case, at turn 18, (0,9), so 2+H=18, H=16.\n\nActions: a2 to a17.\n\nIn the sequence: Turn t1: a_{t1} = a2\n\nTurn t1+1: a3\n\n...\n\nTurn t1 + H -1: a_{2 + H -1} = a_{17}\n\nIn the box.\n\nAlso, for the cars, freeway 5 has three cars, but we didn't go to high rows early, so fine.\n\nIn the sequence, when we go up from turn 9, we pass through all freeways, but at turns after T=9, no collision except T=8,9 which are past, so safe.\n\nFor example, at T=10, y=1, freeway 1, at T=10, no collision, as earlier.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) is 16.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) at turn 3 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving right, so their positions change over time.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. Since all cars are moving right, their spans shift to the right as time increases. For a right-moving car, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)], where (h, τ, d, s) is given at t1.\n\nIn the table, for each freeway, there are cars listed. For example, on freeway 1: (-30, -41, right, 6) and (18, 7, right, 6). I need to be careful with head and tail. For right-moving cars, head is greater than tail, so in (-30, -41), -30 is the head and -41 is the tail? That doesn't make sense because -30 > -41, so head should be the front, which is larger for right-moving.\n\nThe notation says: for left-moving, span [h, τ] with h head, τ tail, and for right-moving, span [τ, h] with τ tail, h head. But in the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nLooking back: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for direction: left-moving or right-moving.\n\nIn the update rule, for left-moving: span [h, τ] moves to [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]\n\nFor right-moving: span [τ, h] moves to [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt]\n\nBut in the input, it's given as (h, τ, d, s), so for right-moving, h is head, τ is tail, and since it's right-moving, head > tail.\n\nIn the example for freeway 1: (-30, -41, right, 6). Head h = -30, tail τ = -41. Since right-moving, head should be greater than tail? -30 > -41, yes, -30 is larger, so head is at -30, tail at -41.\n\nThen the span is [τ, h] = [-41, -30] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, the other car: (18, 7, right, 6), head 18, tail 7, so span [7,18].\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is at (0, k) for some freeway k, and 0 is in the span of some car on freeway k at that turn T.\n\nImportant note: when you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you might move to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, you are still on y_T, so you only check for collision on y_T at time T. If you move to a new row, you don't check that row until the next turn.\n\nPlayer position at turn t is (0, y_t), and at turn t, when you take action a_t, you move to y_{t+1} at the end of the turn, I think.\n\nLet's see the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nSo at the start of turn t, you are at y_t, you choose a_t, then at the end of turn t, you are at y_{t+1}.\n\nBut for collision: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the row you are on during turn T, I think.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on row y_T, and collision is checked based on cars on row y_T at time T.\n\nWhen you move, you change row only at the end of the turn.\n\nSo for a given turn T, your position is fixed at y_T during that turn, and you are vulnerable to cars on that row at time T.\n\nNow, time is in turns, starting from t1=3.\n\nI need to find actions from t=3 onwards.\n\nCurrent turn t1=3, player at (0,1).\n\nI need to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=1, and need to go to y=9, we need to move up, so U actions.\n\nBut we have to avoid cars on the rows.\n\nAlso, we can stay or move down, but since we need to go up, moving down might not be efficient, but perhaps to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's list the car positions over time for each freeway.\n\nt1 = 3.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to know when there is a car at x=0 for that row.\n\nCollision if at turn T, for row k, 0 is in the span of some car on row k at time T.\n\nSince the cars are moving, the spans change.\n\nAlso, multiple cars per row.\n\nFirst, let's define the span at time T for a car given at t1.\n\nLet Δt = T - t1 = T - 3.\n\nFor a right-moving car with (h, τ, d, s) at t1, at time T, the head is at h + s Δt, tail at τ + s Δt, so span [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right-moving, so only that.\n\nd is direction, all are right in this case.\n\nIn the table, all directions are right.\n\nNow, 0 is in span if τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt.\n\nSince for right-moving, tail < head, so τ + s Δt ≤ h + s Δt.\n\n0 is in [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] if τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt.\n\nNow, for each row, I need to find for which T, this is true for some car on that row.\n\nBut T is the turn number, integer.\n\nΔt = T - 3, integer >=0.\n\nNow, let's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeways 1 to 8.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: cars: (-30, -41, right, 6) and (18, 7, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? \"| 1 | (-30, -41, right, 6), (18, 7, right, 6) |\"\n\nAnd freeway 2: \"| 2 | (-30, -41, right, 6), (18, 7, right, 6) |\"\n\nSimilarly for 3 and 4.\n\nFreeway 5: \"| 5 | (-30, -41, right, 6), (6, -5, right, 6), (42, 31, right, 6) |\"\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\nLet's confirm:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars: car A: h=-30, τ=-41, s=6; car B: h=18, τ=7, s=6\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1\n\nFreeway 3: same\n\nFreeway 4: same\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: car A: h=-30, τ=-41, s=6; car C: h=6, τ=-5, s=6; car D: h=42, τ=31, s=6\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nFreeway 1 to 4 have two cars each, freeway 5 to 8 have three cars each.\n\nNow, for each row, I need the times when a car is at x=0.\n\nThat is, for a given row k and time T, if there is a car such that τ + s (T-3) <= 0 <= h + s (T-3)\n\ns=6 for all.\n\nLet Δt = T - 3.\n\nSo condition: for some car, τ + 6 Δt <= 0 and 0 <= h + 6 Δt\n\nWhich is equivalent to: -h / 6 <= Δt <= -τ / 6\n\nBecause from 0 <= h + 6 Δt => Δt >= -h/6\n\nAnd τ + 6 Δt <= 0 => 6 Δt <= -τ => Δt <= -τ/6\n\nSince τ and h could be negative, but let's compute.\n\nAlso, since Δt must be integer, we need to find integer Δt where this holds.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1 (and similarly 2,3,4).\n\nCars:\n\nCar A: τ = -41, h = -30, s=6\n\nThen Δt >= -h/6 = -(-30)/6 = 30/6 = 5\n\nΔt <= -τ/6 = -(-41)/6 = 41/6 ≈ 6.833\n\nSo Δt >=5 and Δt <=6.833, since Δt integer, Δt=5 or 6\n\nAt Δt=5, T=3+5=8\n\nAt Δt=6, T=9\n\nCar B: τ=7, h=18, s=6\n\nΔt >= -h/6 = -18/6 = -3\n\nΔt <= -τ/6 = -7/6 ≈ -1.166\n\nNow Δt >= -3 and Δt <= -1.166, but Δt = T-3 >=0 since T>=3, so Δt >=0.\n\n-3 <= Δt <= -1.166, but Δt >=0, so no overlap. Thus for car B, no time when 0 is in span for Δt >=0.\n\nBecause -1.166 <0, so for Δt=0, let's check: at Δt=0, τ+0=7, h+0=18, 0 not in [7,18]\n\nFor Δt=1, τ+6=13, h+6=24, [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, always positive, so never at 0.\n\nSimilarly for other positive positions.\n\nSo only car A on freeway 1 can have 0 in span, at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2,3,4.\n\nNow freeway 5 to 8.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars.\n\nCar A: same as before, τ=-41, h=-30, s=6, so Δt=5 or 6, T=8 or 9\n\nCar C: h=6, τ=-5, s=6\n\nThen Δt >= -h/6 = -6/6 = -1\n\nΔt <= -τ/6 = -(-5)/6 = 5/6 ≈0.833\n\nSo Δt >= -1 and Δt <= 0.833\n\nSince Δt >=0, so Δt=0 or Δt=1? Δt<=0.833, so Δt=0 since integer.\n\nΔt=0: T=3\n\nCheck: at Δt=0, τ +0 = -5, h+0=6, span [-5,6], 0 is in [-5,6], yes.\n\nΔt=1: Δt=1, τ+6=1, h+6=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nBut Δt<=0.833, so only Δt=0.\n\nΔt>= -1 and Δt<=0.833, integer Δt, so Δt=0 only.\n\nBecause Δt=0 is >= -1 and <=0.833.\n\nΔt=1 is 1>0.833, no.\n\nSo only at Δt=0, T=3.\n\nCar D: h=42, τ=31, s=6\n\nΔt >= -42/6 = -7\n\nΔt <= -31/6 ≈ -5.166\n\nΔt >= -7 and Δt <= -5.166, but Δt >=0, no overlap. So never at 0.\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nSo for freeway 5, at T=3, car C is at x=0? At T=3, Δt=0, car C span [-5,6], so 0 is in it, yes.\n\nAlso at T=8 and T=9 from car A.\n\nT=8 and T=9 are from car A, which is also on freeway 5.\n\nNow for freeway 5, at T=3: car C has span including 0.\n\nAt T=8: car A has span [τ +6*5, h+6*5] = [-41+30, -30+30] = [-11,0]? Δt=5, T=8\n\nτ + s Δt = -41 + 6*5 = -41+30 = -11\n\nh + s Δt = -30 + 30 = 0\n\nSo span [-11, 0], so 0 is included, yes.\n\nAt T=9, Δt=6, τ+36= -41+36= -5, h+36= -30+36=6, span [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nSimilarly, at T=3, car C: span [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nNow, for freeway 6,7,8 same as 5.\n\nBut freeway 6,7,8 have same cars as 5.\n\nNow, we also have the player position.\n\nPlayer starts at turn 3, y=1.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9, so we need to increase y by 8, from 1 to 9.\n\nEach U action increases y by 1, S keeps same, D decreases.\n\nTo minimize H, we probably want to use U as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the actions to reach y=9.\n\nThe sequence {a_t for t=0 to H-1}, but t here is relative, I think.\n\nThe answer should be actions starting from t1=3.\n\nIn the sequence, t from t1 to t1 + H -1, and after H turns, we are at y=9.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, we reach y=9.\n\nLet me define the turns.\n\nSet t=0 as turn 3, for simplicity.\n\nSo at turn 0 (which is t1=3), player at y=1.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn T, and T is H, the number of turns from start.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1 + H -1? Let's clarify.\n\nStart at turn t1, position y_{t1}.\n\nAfter first action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t1 + k, position y_{t1 + k}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + k} = 9 for some k, and minimize k, I think? No.\n\nH is the minimal number of turns such that we reach at turn t1 + H -1? I think I misread.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so t from 0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nAfter these H actions, we are at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nThe position at turn t1 + H should be (0,9), I think.\n\nLet's see: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"minimal number of turns H\"\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H-1}, we have y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nAt turn t1 + H, position is y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nBut during the turns, we need to avoid collision.\n\nNow, at each turn, from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -1, we are at some y, and we must not collide with cars on that row at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, and we take action, then at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}, but during turn T, we are on y_T.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, we are on row y_T, and we check cars on row y_T at time T.\n\nIn this case, time T is the turn number.\n\nNow, back to the car occupancy.\n\nI need for each row and each turn, whether there is a car at x=0.\n\nBut since the player moves, we only care about the row we are on at that turn.\n\nTo plan the path, I need to know when it's safe to be on which row.\n\nFirst, let's list for each row, the times when it is occupied, i.e., there is a car at x=0 at that turn.\n\nSince multiple cars, but we care if any car is at x=0.\n\nAlso, for rows with no cars? But all rows have cars, from the table.\n\nFreeway 1 to 8 all have cars.\n\nNow, let's find for each row k, the set of T where collision occurs if on row k at time T.\n\nT from 3 onwards.\n\nSince we start at T=3.\n\nFor row k=1: from earlier, only occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly for k=2,3,4 same.\n\nFor k=5: occupied at T=3 (from car C), T=8 (car A), T=9 (car A)\n\nAt T=3: car C\n\nAt T=8: car A span [-11,0]\n\nAt T=9: car A span [-5,6], both include 0.\n\nSimilarly for k=6,7,8 same as k=5.\n\nk=5 to 8 all have the same car set, so same occupancy times.\n\nk=1 to 4: occupied only at T=8,9\n\nk=5 to 8: occupied at T=3,8,9\n\nT=3 is now, current turn.\n\nPlayer at turn T=3, y=1.\n\nAt turn T=3, we are on row y=1.\n\nNow, row y=1 is freeway 1? Freeway k corresponds to row y=k, I think.\n\nThe freeways are at y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nPlayer at (0,1), so row 1.\n\nAt turn T=3, on row 1.\n\nIs row 1 occupied at T=3? From above, for row 1, occupied at T=8 and 9, not at T=3.\n\nSimilarly, at T=3, row 1 is safe.\n\nNow, we need to go up to row 9.\n\nBut row 9 is not a freeway, it's the target, so no cars on row 9 or row 0, I assume.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=1, ends at y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nNow, from y=1, we need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of actions: since we need to go from y=1 to y=9, delta y=8, each U action increases y by 1, so at least 8 U actions, and possibly some S or D, but D would increase the number, so probably all U, but we might need to wait or something to avoid collisions.\n\nH could be more than 8 if we have to wait.\n\nBut since we can move vertically instantly, we might not need to wait, but we have to avoid being on a row when it is occupied.\n\nNow, let's list the occupancy:\n\nFor each row and time:\n\nTime T | Row 1 | Row 2 | Row 3 | Row 4 | Row 5 | Row 6 | Row 7 | Row 8\n\nSince rows 1-4 are identical in occupancy, rows 5-8 identical.\n\nOccupancy:\n\nRow 1: unsafe at T=8,9\n\nSimilarly row 2,3,4 same.\n\nRow 5: unsafe at T=3,8,9\n\nSimilarly row 6,7,8.\n\nNow, T=3 is current turn, we are on row 1, which is safe at T=3.\n\nWe need to be at row 9 at some future turn.\n\nSince row 9 is safe, we can be there anytime.\n\nBut we have to pass through the rows.\n\nThe player can only change by +1, -1, or 0 each turn.\n\nSo to go from y=1 to y=9, we need to increase y, but we might stay or move down temporarily.\n\nBut to minimize turns, we should avoid unnecessary moves.\n\nSince we need net +8, if we use only U, we need 8 actions to reach y=9 in 8 turns.\n\nBut we might collide if we are on a row when it is occupied.\n\nLet's see if we can go directly up in 8 turns.\n\nStart at T=3, y=1.\n\nAction at each turn.\n\nAfter action, position at next turn.\n\nTurn T: position y_T, take action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + delta y.\n\nAt turn T, we are on y_T, and collision check for row y_T at time T.\n\nFor the path to be safe, for each turn T, when we are on y_T, it must be safe at that T.\n\nNow, suppose we go straight up: all U actions.\n\nThen:\n\nAt T=3, y=1, safe (as above)\n\nTake U, so y_{4} = 2\n\nAt T=4, y=2, on row 2.\n\nIs row 2 safe at T=4? From above, row 2 unsafe only at T=8,9, so at T=4, safe.\n\nTake U, y5=3\n\nT=5, y=3, safe, since unsafe only 8,9.\n\nTake U, y6=4\n\nT=6, y=4, safe.\n\nTake U, y7=5\n\nNow T=7, y=5? Position at T=7 is y=5.\n\nAt turn T=7, we are on y=5.\n\nIs row 5 safe at T=7?\n\nRow 5 unsafe at T=3,8,9.\n\nT=7 not in {3,8,9}, so should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, take U, y8=6\n\nT=8, y=6, on row 6.\n\nRow 6 unsafe at T=3,8,9.\n\nT=8 is unsafe! Oh, collision.\n\nAt T=8, if we are on row 6, it is occupied.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=8, y=6, row 6 is occupied, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we continue.\n\nAfter y7=5 at T=7, take U, y8=6, but at T=8, we are on y=6, which is unsafe.\n\nTake S or D, but we need to go up.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster or slower.\n\nAnother idea: since row 5-8 are unsafe at T=8 and T=9, we need to not be on those rows at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly, row 1-4 unsafe at T=8,9, but row 1-4 are lower.\n\nWe are starting from y=1 at T=3.\n\nTarget y=9.\n\nThe unsafe times are T=8 and T=9 for all rows 1-8.\n\nAlso, row 5-8 unsafe at T=3, but we are not on them at T=3.\n\nT=3 is only for row 5-8, but we are on row 1.\n\nNow, to avoid T=8 and T=9 on rows 1-8.\n\nBut we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\ny=9 is safe always.\n\nThe minimal time: if we can reach y=9 before T=8, or after T=9.\n\nSince we start at T=3, y=1, with all U, we would be:\n\nAfter k U actions, y_{3+k} = 1 + k\n\nSet 1+k =9, k=8, so at turn T=3+8=11, y=9? Let's see the turns.\n\nAt turn T=3, y=1\n\nAfter action a3, at turn T=4, y2\n\n...\n\nAfter 8 actions, after a_{10}, at turn T=11, y=1+8=9.\n\nT=11.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, if we are on rows 1-8, it is unsafe.\n\nIn the all U path:\n\nAt T=3, y=1\n\nT=4, y=2\n\nT=5, y=3\n\nT=6, y=4\n\nT=7, y=5\n\nT=8, y=6 → unsafe if row 6 occupied at T=8, which it is.\n\nSimilarly, T=9, y=7, row 7 unsafe at T=9.\n\nT=10, y=8, row 8: is row 8 unsafe at T=10?\n\nRow 8 unsafe at T=3,8,9. T=10 not in, so safe? But we are not at T=10 yet.\n\nIn the sequence: at T=10, y=8, take U, to y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, we are on y=6 and y=7, both unsafe.\n\nSo collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nTherefore, all U in 8 actions to T=11 is not possible because of collisions at T=8 and T=9.\n\nWe need to avoid being on rows 1-8 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, we can be on y=9 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 can be reached at T=8 or earlier or later.\n\nFirst, what is the earliest we can reach y=9.\n\nStart y=1 at T=3, each U increases y, so after 8 U, at T=11, y=9, as above.\n\nBut we can go faster? No, only one step per turn.\n\nUnless we start at T=3, y=1, after 0 actions, still at T=3, y=1.\n\nAfter 1 U, at T=4, y=2\n\nAfter 2 U, T=5, y=3\n\n...\n\nAfter 7 U, T=10, y=8\n\nAfter 8 U, T=11, y=9\n\nSo earliest at T=11.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, we are on intermediate rows which are unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, we need to be on y=9 or y=0 at T=8 and T=9, but y=0 is below, we are going up.\n\ny=0 is safe, but we start from y=1, going to y=9, so moving down to y=0 might not help.\n\nWe can stay on a safe row or move to safe rows.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, all rows 1-8 are unsafe, as per above.\n\nRows 1-4 unsafe at T=8,9, rows 5-8 also unsafe at T=8,9.\n\nSo at T=8 and T=9, any row from 1 to 8 has a car at x=0, so if we are on that row, collision.\n\nTherefore, to avoid collision at T=8 and T=9, we must not be on rows 1-8 at those times.\n\nThat means we must be on row 0 or row 9 at turn T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut row 0 or 9.\n\nNow, we start from y=1 at T=3, and need to reach y=9.\n\nIf we can be on row 9 by T=8, or on row 0 at T=8 and T=9, but row 0 is not the target.\n\nLet's see the timing.\n\nFirst, to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nEarliest at T=11 with all U.\n\nBut at T=11, y=9, safe.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, we are on y=6 and y=7, which are rows 6 and 7, unsafe.\n\nWe need to adjust the path so that at T=8 and T=9, we are not on rows 1-8.\n\nSo possible to be on row 9 or row 0.\n\nBut row 9 is the target, we can reach it earlier? No, because from y=1, it takes 8 steps to y=9, so minimum T=11.\n\nWe can be on row 0 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut row 0 is below, so we need to go down first.\n\nFor example, from y=1, we can move down to y=0 at some point.\n\nBut that might increase the number of turns.\n\nLet's think.\n\nWe need to have, for turn T=8 and T=9, y_T = 0 or 9.\n\nBut y=9 at T=8 is impossible because from T=3 to T=8, only 5 turns, we can increase y by at most 5, from y=1 to y=6, not to 9.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=0 at T=8, we can go down.\n\nThen at T=9, we can be at y=0 or y=9.\n\nBut if we are at y=0 at T=9, we still need to go up to y=9, which takes 9 steps, so more turns.\n\nLet's list the turns from T=3 to T=11 or so.\n\nTurn T: y_T must be safe.\n\nWe need to define the actions.\n\nSet t=0 as relative, but let's keep absolute T.\n\nTurn T=3: start, y=1, must be safe: row 1 safe at T=3, yes.\n\nT=4: we can be y=0,1,2 depending on action at T=3.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nThe critical points are T=8 and T=9, where y must be 0 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, other times may have constraints.\n\nFirst, for T=8 and T=9, y_T must be 0 or 9.\n\nSince y=9 is the target, we can aim to be at y=9 by T=8 or earlier, but impossible, min T=11.\n\nBe at y=0 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nBut it takes time.\n\nLet's find a sequence.\n\nFirst, at T=3: y=1, safe. We can take action.\n\nIf we take U, y=2 at T=4.\n\nIf we take D, y=0 at T=4.\n\nIf S, y=1 at T=4.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need net +8 in y.\n\nEach U is +1, D is -1, S is 0.\n\nLet u be number of U, d number of D, s number of S.\n\nThen net delta y = u - d = 8.\n\nTotal turns H = u + d + s.\n\nWe want min H, so we want to minimize s and d, since d increases the net needed.\n\nBut we might need to wait or move down to avoid.\n\nSince at T=8 and T=9, we must be at y=0 or 9, and y=9 impossible before T=11, so must be at y=0 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSo y_8 = 0 and y_9 = 0.\n\nThen from T=3 to T=8, we need to go from y=1 to y=0, but that's down, but we can go down immediately.\n\nFor example, at T=3, take D, then y_4 = 0.\n\nThen at T=4, y=0, safe.\n\nThen we can stay at y=0 or move up.\n\nBut we need to be at y=0 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSo we can stay at y=0 from some time to T=9.\n\nThen after T=9, go up to y=9.\n\nNow, from y=0 to y=9, need 9 U actions.\n\nBut we are at y=0 at T=4 if we took D at T=3.\n\nSet y_8 = 0 and y_9 = 0.\n\nFrom T=3, y=1, to T=8, y=0.\n\nDelta y = -1, so we need net decrease of 1, so d - u =1 for that period, but we have multiple actions.\n\nThe number of turns from T=3 to T=8 is 5 turns: T=3,4,5,6,7 actions to set y_8.\n\ny_8 is position at turn 8, after actions from T=3 to T=7.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAction a_T determines y_{T+1}.\n\ny_{T+1} = y_T + delta y_T.\n\nFor turn T, we are on y_T.\n\nTo have y_8 = 0.\n\ny_8 is position at turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, y_9 position at turn 9.\n\nWe need y_8 = 0 or 9, but 9 impossible, so y_8 = 0.\n\nSimilarly y_9 = 0 or 9.\n\nIf y_8 = 0, then at T=8, on row 0, safe.\n\nThen at T=8, we can take action to go to y_9.\n\nIf we want y_9 = 0, take S or D from y=0, but D to y=-1? y in [0,9], so y=0, take D, y=0? I think y is bounded.\n\ny_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0, take D, y_{t+1}=0, similarly up to 9.\n\nSo from y=0, take D, stay at 0; take U, go to 1; take S, stay 0.\n\nSimilarly for y=9.\n\nSo if y_8 = 0, then at T=8, we can take S to have y_9=0, or take U to go to y=1 at T=9.\n\nBut at T=9, if y_9=1, and on row 1, it is unsafe at T=9.\n\nSimilarly, any row 1-8 unsafe at T=9.\n\nSo if we go to y=1 at T=9, collision.\n\nTherefore, at T=9, we must be on y=0 or y=9.\n\nSo if we are at y_8=0, we must take S to have y_9=0, or if we can go to y=9 directly, but impossible.\n\nFrom y=0, to y=9, takes 9 steps, so at least to T=8+9=17, late.\n\nBut we can go to y=9 later.\n\nFirst, set y_8=0 and y_9=0.\n\nThen after that, go up to y=9.\n\nNow, from start.\n\nAt T=3, y=1.\n\nWe need to reach y=0 by T=8.\n\ny_8=0.\n\nNow, from T=3 to T=8, there are 5 actions: at T=3,4,5,6,7 to determine y_4 to y_8.\n\ny_4 is after a3, y_5 after a4, etc., up to y_8 after a7.\n\nPosition y_T at turn T is before action a_T, I think.\n\nClarify.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, then we take action a_T, then position becomes y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nSo at turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nFor y_8 to be 0, that means at turn 8, position is 0.\n\nSimilarly, y_9 at turn 9 is 0.\n\nTo have y_8=0, starting from y_3=1.\n\nThe net change from T=3 to T=8: y_8 - y_3 = sum of delta y from t=3 to t=7.\n\nActions from t=3 to t=7 determine y_4 to y_8.\n\ny_4 = y_3 + delta y_3\n\ny_5 = y_4 + delta y_4 = y_3 + delta y_3 + delta y_4\n\n...\n\ny_8 = y_3 + sum_{t=3 to 7} delta y_t\n\ny_3 =1\n\ny_8 = 0, so 0 = 1 + sum_{t=3 to 7} delta y_t\n\nThus sum_{t=3 to 7} delta y_t = -1\n\nEach delta y_t is +1, -1, or 0.\n\nSo we need the sum of 5 actions to be -1.\n\nFor example, one D and four S, or other combinations.\n\nBut we also need to be safe at each turn from T=3 to T=7 and T=8.\n\nT=8 we are at y=0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, for T=9, we need y_9=0, so at T=8, take S, then y_9=0.\n\nThen at T=9, y=0, safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up to y=9 with 9 U actions.\n\nBut that will take many turns.\n\nWe can go up earlier, but we have to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nThe unsafe times are only T=8 and T=9 for all rows, and for rows 5-8 also at T=3, but T=3 is past.\n\nOther times may be safe.\n\nFor example, at T=4,5,6,7,10, etc., the rows are safe except for the occupancy we listed.\n\nFrom earlier, for each row, unsafe only at specific times.\n\nFor row 1-4: unsafe only at T=8,9\n\nFor row 5-8: unsafe at T=3,8,9\n\nT=3 is done.\n\nAt T=4,5,6,7,10,11, etc., all rows are safe, as long as not at T=8,9.\n\nFor example, at T=10, row 1-4 safe, row 5-8 safe, since unsafe only at 3,8,9.\n\nSimilarly T=11, safe.\n\nSo the only dangerous turns are T=8 and T=9.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go up as fast as possible, but be at y=0 or y=9 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSince y=9 at T=8 impossible, we must be at y=0 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nThen after T=9, go up to y=9.\n\nNow, to be at y=0 at T=8, from y=1 at T=3.\n\nWith 5 actions (from T=3 to T=7), we need to have y_8 =0.\n\ny_8 = y_3 + sum_{t=3 to 7} delta y_t = 1 + sum =0, so sum = -1.\n\nFor example, we can take one D and four S in some order.\n\nBut we need to be safe during the turns.\n\nSince we are going down or staying, and rows 1-4 are safe at T=4,5,6,7, etc., except T=8,9 but we are not there yet.\n\nT=4 to T=7 are safe for all rows, since unsafe only at T=8,9 for 1-4, and for 5-8 only at T=3,8,9.\n\nSo at T=4,5,6,7, all rows are safe.\n\nNo problem.\n\nSo we can, for example, at T=3, take D, then y_4 = 0.\n\nThen at T=4, y=0, take S, y_5=0\n\nT=5, y=0, S, y_6=0\n\nT=6, y=0, S, y_7=0\n\nT=7, y=0, S, y_8=0\n\nThen at T=8, y=0, take S, y_9=0\n\nT=9, y=0, safe.\n\nThen from here, we need to go to y=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=0, take U, y_10=1\n\nT=10, y=1, take U, y_11=2\n\n...\n\nUp to y=9.\n\nAfter 9 U actions, from y=0 to y=9.\n\nAt T=9, after action, y_10.\n\nSet:\n\nAt T=9, y=0, take U, then y_10=1\n\nT=10, y=1, take U, y_11=2\n\nT=11, y=2, U, y_12=3\n\nT=12, y=3, U, y_13=4\n\nT=13, y=4, U, y_14=5\n\nT=14, y=5, U, y_15=6\n\nT=15, y=6, U, y_16=7\n\nT=16, y=7, U, y_17=8\n\nT=17, y=8, U, y_18=9\n\nThen at T=18, y=9, reached.\n\nBut this is many turns, H is large.\n\nWe reached at T=18, so H actions from t1=3 to t1+H-1=18, so t1+H-1=18, t1=3, so 3+H-1=18, H-1=15, H=16.\n\nActions from t=3 to t=3+15=18? Let's see.\n\nSequence: actions a_t for t=3 to t=3+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1+H, position y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nHere, at turn 18, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=3 to t=17, actions a3 to a17, that's 15 actions? Turns: action at T, affects next position.\n\nAction a_t taken at turn t.\n\nAfter a_t, position at turn t+1.\n\nStart: turn 3, position y3=1\n\nAfter a3, position y4\n\n...\n\nAfter a17, position y18\n\nWe want y18=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions a_t for t=3 to t=17, that's t from 3 to 17, number of actions: 15 actions? t=3,4,5,...,17, that's 15 terms: 17-3+1=15 actions.\n\nH=15, since {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so for H actions, from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nHere t1=3, actions from 3 to 3+H-1.\n\nAfter a_{3+H-1}, position at (3+H-1)+1 = t1+H.\n\nSet y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, y18=9, so t1+H=18, 3+H=18, H=15.\n\nBut earlier with all U, H=8 to reach at T=11, but not possible due to collision.\n\nBut in this down and up, H=15, large.\n\nWe can reach faster if we go up but avoid T=8 and T=9 on the rows.\n\nFor example, be at y=9 by T=10 or something.\n\nEarliest possible T for y=9 is T=11, as before.\n\nAt T=11, y=9, safe.\n\nBut to be there, we need to pass through lower rows at earlier times.\n\nThe problem is T=8 and T=9.\n\nIf we can be on a row that is safe at T=8 and T=9, but all rows 1-8 are unsafe, so only y=0 or 9.\n\nBut y=9 not possible at T=8.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at T=8 and T=9, we can be on y=9, but impossible, or on y=0.\n\nBut we can be on y=0 only at T=8 and T=9, not necessarily before.\n\nFor example, we can go up to some point, then down to y=0 at T=8.\n\nLet's see the net.\n\nFrom T=3 to T=8, 5 turns, start y=1, end y=0, so net delta y = -1.\n\nSimilarly, for T=9, y=0.\n\nThen from T=9 onwards, go up to y=9.\n\nTo reach y=9 faster, we should go up as much as possible before T=8, but then go down to y=0 at T=8.\n\nFor example, at T=3, y=1, take U, to y=2 at T=4\n\nT=4, U, y=3 at T=5\n\nT=5, U, y=4 at T=6\n\nT=6, U, y=5 at T=7\n\nNow at T=7, y=5, we need y_8=0, so we must take D, then y_8 = 5 -1 =4, not 0.\n\ny_8 = y_7 + delta y_7\n\ny_7=5, to have y_8=0, need delta y_7 = -5, but delta y is only +1,-1,0, so impossible to go from y=5 to y=0 in one action.\n\nThe position change is gradual.\n\nFrom y=1 at T=3, after actions, at T=8, y_8 can be from 1-5 to 1+5, but since we need y_8=0, we must have decreased.\n\nMaximum decrease: from y=1, take D at T=3, y4=0, then stay at 0 until T=8.\n\nBut we can be higher earlier.\n\nFor example, suppose at T=3, U, y4=2\n\nT=4, U, y5=3\n\nT=5, U, y6=4\n\nT=6, U, y7=5\n\nNow at T=7, y=5, we need y_8=0, but can only go to y=4,5,6 with U,D,S.\n\nCannot reach 0.\n\nSimilarly, if we take D at T=7, y8=4\n\nThen at T=8, y=4, which is row 4, unsafe at T=8.\n\nCollision.\n\nTo have y_8=0, we must be at low y earlier.\n\nFor example, at T=7, we need y_7 such that we can go to y_8=0, so y_7 must be 0 or 1.\n\nIf y_7=0, take S or D to y8=0\n\nIf y_7=1, take D to y8=0\n\nSimilarly for other points.\n\nSo to have y_8=0, we need y_7 <=1, and take appropriate action.\n\nSimilarly, to have y_7 low, we need to decrease earlier.\n\nBut we can increase first.\n\nLet's find a path that reaches high y quickly but comes down to 0 at T=8.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=3: y=1, take U, y4=2\n\nT=4: y=2, take U, y5=3\n\nT=5: y=3, take U, y6=4\n\nT=6: y=4, take U, y7=5\n\nBut at T=7, y=5, cannot go to y8=0, min y8=4 with D.\n\nThen at T=8, y=4, unsafe.\n\nTake D at T=6 instead.\n\nT=3: U, y4=2\n\nT=4: U, y5=3\n\nT=5: U, y6=4\n\nT=6: y=4, take D, y7=3\n\nT=7: y=3, take D, y8=2\n\nBut y8=2, not 0, and row 2 unsafe at T=8.\n\nStill unsafe.\n\nTo reach y=0 at T=8, we need to be at y=1 or 0 at T=7.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=3: y=1, take D, y4=0\n\nThen T=4: y=0, we can stay or move.\n\nBut we need to be at y=0 at T=8 and T=9, so we can stay at y=0 from T=4 to T=9.\n\nBut then we waste turns at y=0.\n\nGo up and down.\n\nFor example, from T=4 y=0, take U to y=1 at T=5\n\nBut at T=5, y=1, row 1 safe, etc., but then we need to be back to 0 at T=8.\n\nSo from T=5 y=1, to T=8 y=0, net -1 in 3 actions.\n\nPossible, e.g., S,S,D or other.\n\nBut let's list all.\n\nTo minimize time, we should spend as many turns as possible going up before we need to be down.\n\nBut since we have to be at y=0 at T=8, the latest we can start going down is when we can reach y=0 by T=8.\n\nFor example, at T=7, we must have y_7 <=1 to reach y_8=0.\n\nIf y_7=1, take D to y8=0\n\nIf y_7=0, take S to y8=0\n\nSimilarly, at T=6, y_6 can be up to 2, because if y_6=2, take D to y7=1, then at T=7, y=1, take D to y8=0.\n\nIf y_6=1, take D to y7=0, then S to y8=0, etc.\n\nSo the position at earlier turns can be higher.\n\nBut we need to be safe at all turns.\n\nFor example, at T=6, if we are on y=2, row 2 is safe at T=6, since unsafe only T=8,9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo we can be at higher y at earlier turns.\n\nFor instance:\n\nAt T=3: y=1, take U, y4=2  (safe, T=4 row2 safe)\n\nT=4: y=2, take U, y5=3  (T=5 row3 safe)\n\nT=5: y=3, take U, y6=4  (T=6 row4 safe)\n\nT=6: y=4, take D, y7=3  (T=7, y=3, row3 safe at T=7)\n\nT=7: y=3, take D, y8=2  but y8=2, at T=8 on row2, unsafe!\n\ny8=2, not 0.\n\nI forgot, we need y8=0.\n\nIn this case, at T=7, y=3, take D, y8=2, which is not 0.\n\nTo have y8=0, from y7=3, we need to take D, but y8=2, not 0.\n\nOnly if y7=1 or 0.\n\nSo from above, at T=6, y=4, we took D to y7=3.\n\nBut y7=3, too high to reach y8=0.\n\nInstead, at T=5, after y5=3, take D to y6=2\n\nThen T=6: y=2, take D to y7=1\n\nT=7: y=1, take D to y8=0\n\nThen at T=8, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at T=8, take S, y9=0\n\nT=9, y=0, safe.\n\nThen from T=9, go up.\n\nNow, at T=9, y=0, take U, y10=1\n\nT=10, y=1, U, y11=2\n\nT=11, y=2, U, y12=3\n\nT=12, y=3, U, y13=4\n\nT=13, y=4, U, y14=5\n\nT=14, y=5, U, y15=6\n\nT=15, y=6, U, y16=7\n\nT=16, y=7, U, y17=8\n\nT=17, y=8, U, y18=9\n\nReached at T=18, same as before.\n\nBut we used some D actions, so net to go up we need more U.\n\nIn this sequence, from T=3 to T=8, we have actions: U,U,D,D,D\n\nAt T=3: U to y4=2\n\nT=4: U to y5=3\n\nT=5: D to y6=2\n\nT=6: D to y7=1\n\nT=7: D to y8=0\n\nThen T=8: S to y9=0\n\nT=9: now at y=0, take U to y10=1\n\nThen U each to y18=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=3 to T=17 for actions, 15 actions, H=15.\n\nBut we can reach y=9 faster if we go up immediately after T=9.\n\nBut from T=9 y=0 to T=18 y=9, 9 turns.\n\nSince at T=10,11, etc., all safe, we can go directly.\n\nBut minimal is 9 turns from y=0.\n\nUnless we start going up before, but we have to be at y=0 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps we don't need to be at y=0 at both T=8 and T=9, but only at those turns we are not on rows 1-8.\n\nBut at T=8, if we are on y=9, safe, but impossible.\n\nOr on y=0.\n\nSimilarly for T=9.\n\nBut if at T=8 we are on y=0, safe, then at T=8, we can take U to go to y=1 at T=9, but at T=9, y=1, row 1 unsafe, collision.\n\nSo we cannot, because we must be safe at T=9.\n\nTherefore, we must be on y=0 or 9 at T=9.\n\nSince 9 impossible, y=0 at T=9.\n\nSimilarly for T=8.\n\nSo we must have y_8=0 and y_9=0.\n\nNo choice.\n\nThen the earliest to reach y=9 is after that.\n\nBut is there a way to reach y=9 before T=11?\n\nNo, because from y=1 at T=3, with all U, at T=11 y=9.\n\nIf we go down first, we start from lower, take more time.\n\nSo minimal H is at least 8 for the net up, but with the down, we have extra actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have 2 D actions to go down from y=3 to y=1, but we also have U actions that are net zero.\n\nIn the down phase, we used U to go up to 3, then D down to 0, so net from T=3 to T=8: y from 1 to 0, net -1, with 3 U and 3 D, for example, but in my sequence I had 2 U and 3 D from T=3 to T=8 actions.\n\nT=3 to T=7 actions determine y4 to y8.\n\ny3=1\n\nAfter a3: y4\n\na4: y5\n\na5: y6\n\na6: y7\n\na7: y8\n\n5 actions.\n\nIn my sequence: a3=U, y4=2\n\na4=U, y5=3\n\na5=D, y6=2\n\na6=D, y7=1\n\na7=D, y8=0\n\nSo actions: U,U,D,D,D\n\nNet delta: +1 +1 -1 -1 -1 = -1, yes, y8=1-1=0.\n\nNumber of actions to reach y8=0: 5 actions.\n\nThen a8=S, y9=0\n\nThen from a9 to a17: 9 U actions to go from y9=0 to y18=9.\n\nActions a9=U, y10=1\n\n...\n\na17=U, y18=9\n\nSo actions from t=3 to t=17, that's t=3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17: 15 actions.\n\nH=15.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at T=11 if we can avoid being on the dangerous rows at T=8 and T=9, but since we have to be on some row, and all are dangerous, impossible unless on 0 or 9.\n\nBut at T=11, we can be on y=9, but to be there, at T=8 and T=9 we are on lower rows.\n\nUnless we can be on y=9 at T=9 or something.\n\nAt T=9, if we are on y=9, safe.\n\nBut to be on y=9 at T=9, from y=1 at T=3, in 6 turns, we can increase by at most 6, to y=7, not 9.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, y=9 impossible.\n\nSo the only way is to be on y=0 at T=8 and T=9, then go up.\n\nBut we can start going up after T=9 immediately.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have to go down to y=0 at T=8, but we can be at higher y before that.\n\nFor example, at T=6, we can be at y=4 or something, as long as we go down to y=0 at T=8.\n\nBut in the up phase after T=9, it takes 9 turns from y=0.\n\nSince y=9 is safe at all times, we can reach it earlier if we don't go down, but we have to avoid T=8 and T=9 on rows 1-8.\n\nBut we can't, so we must be on 0 at those times.\n\nPerhaps at T=8 and T=9, if we are on row 0, but row 0 has no cars, safe.\n\nBut then we lose time.\n\nAnother thought: are there other unsafe times?\n\nFor example, at T=3 for rows 5-8, but we are not on them.\n\nOr at other times, but from the occupancy, only T=3,8,9 for rows 5-8, and T=8,9 for rows 1-4.\n\nSo for example, at T=10, all rows are safe.\n\nSo if we can be on y=9 at T=10 or something.\n\nEarliest T=11 with all U.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, we are on y=6 and y=7, unsafe.\n\nTo not be on those rows, we need to be slower or faster, but faster impossible.\n\nSlower: if we stay at lower rows longer, then at T=8 and T=9, we can be on y=0.\n\nFor example, stay at y=1 for several turns, then go down to 0 at T=8.\n\nBut at T=3, y=1, if we take S, y4=1, then S, y5=1, etc., but then at T=8, we need to be at 0, so from y=1, take D to y9=0, but y9 is at T=9.\n\nLet's define.\n\nSuppose we stay at y=1 until some point.\n\nAt T=3: y=1, take S, y4=1\n\nT=4: S, y5=1\n\nT=5: S, y6=1\n\nT=6: S, y7=1\n\nT=7: D, y8=0  (since y7=1, D to y8=0)\n\nThen T=8: S, y9=0\n\nThen T=9: U, y10=1\n\nThen U to y=9.\n\nFrom T=9 y=0, take U, y10=1\n\nT=10 U y11=2\n\n...\nT=17 U y18=9\n\nStill 15 actions.\n\nFrom T=7 to T=8, from y=1 to y=0 with D.\n\nBut the number is the same.\n\nTo save time, we can go up to a higher row before T=7, then come down.\n\nFor example, at T=3: U to y4=2\n\nT=4: U to y5=3\n\nT=5: U to y6=4\n\nT=6: S to y7=4  (stay)\n\nT=7: D to y8=3? But we need y8=0, not.\n\nCannot.\n\nTo have y8=0, at T=7 y must be 0 or 1.\n\nSo maximum at T=7 is y=1 if we go down.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=3: U to y4=2\n\nT=4: U to y5=3\n\nT=5: U to y6=4\n\nT=6: D to y7=3\n\nT=7: D to y8=2  not 0.\n\nTo reach low, we need to start down earlier.\n\nT=3: U to y4=2\n\nT=4: U to y5=3\n\nT=5: D to y6=2\n\nT=6: D to y7=1\n\nT=7: D to y8=0\n\nAs before.\n\nThen T=8: S to y9=0\n\nT=9: U to y10=1\n\nThen U each to y18=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAfter T=9, when we go up, at T=10, y=1, safe; T=11,y=2 safe; ... up to T=17,y=8 safe; T=18,y=9.\n\nAll safe since no cars at T=10-18 except T=8,9 but past.\n\nT=8 and 9 are the only bad times.\n\nSo I think H=15 is the minimal for this approach.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose we are at y=0 at T=8 and T=9, then at T=9, we are at y=0, we take U to y10=1, but to reach y=9 faster, we need to start from higher, but we can't because we have to be at 0 at T=9.\n\nPerhaps at T=9, we can be at y=9, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=8 and T=9, we must be on y=0, and at T=10, we can be on y=1, but to reach y=9 at T=11, we need to be at y=8 at T=10, but at T=10, if y=8, row 8 is safe, but we are at y=0 at T=9, so at T=9, y=0, take U to y10=1, not to 8.\n\nCannot jump.\n\nSo impossible to reach before T=11, and at T=11 we can be if no down, but with down, later.\n\nSo minimal H is 15 with the down and up.\n\nBut perhaps we can have fewer S actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we have some S or D that are not necessary.\n\nFor example, in the down phase, we can have all U and D with net -1, no S.\n\nSimilarly in up, all U.\n\nIn the sequence I have, from T=3 to T=8: actions U,U,D,D,D, no S.\n\nThen T=8: S to stay at 0, but we can take U, but if we take U at T=8, y9=1, then at T=9, y=1, unsafe.\n\nSo must take S to stay at 0 for T=9.\n\nThen at T=9, take U to start up.\n\nSo we need that S at T=8.\n\nNo way around.\n\nThen up with all U.\n\nSo 5 actions to go down to 0 at T=8, but with net -1 from y=1.\n\nThen one action at T=8 to stay, then 9 actions to go up.\n\nTotal actions: from T=3 to T=8, 5 actions (a3 to a7), then a8, then a9 to a17 for up, a9 to a17 is 9 actions, plus a8, total 5+1+9=15 actions.\n\nActions a3 to a17 inclusive.\n\nList: a3,a4,a5,a6,a7 for down to y8=0\n\na8 for stay\n\na9 to a17 for up to y18=9\n\na9 to a17 is 9 actions: a9,a10,a11,a12,a13,a14,a15,a16,a17.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in the answer, we need the sequence for the minimal H.\n\nBut is there a way with less than 15?\n\nSuppose we go down earlier to y=0 and stay, but then we start from lower, same thing.\n\nOr, we can be at y=0 at T=8 and T=9, but after T=9, go up, but perhaps we can be at higher y at T=10 if we start from y=0 at T=9.\n\nBut no.\n\nAnother thought: at T=9, if we are at y=0, we take U to y10=1, but to reach y=9 at T=11, we need y10=8, impossible.\n\nSo impossible to reach before T=18 with this approach.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to be at y=0 at both T=8 and T=9, but only at one, but no, because at each turn, we must be safe.\n\nAt T=8, must be on 0 or 9; at T=9, must be on 0 or 9.\n\nSo both.\n\nUnless we are on 9 at one of them, but impossible.\n\nSo I think 15 is the best.\n\nBut let's check the car positions again.\n\nPerhaps for some rows, at T=8 and T=9, it is not occupied, but from above, all rows 1-8 are occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFor example, row 1 at T=8: car A span [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nSimilarly all.\n\nSo yes.\n\nPerhaps for row 9, no cars, safe.\n\nBut can't reach.\n\nSo I think we have to accept H=15.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach y=9 at T=10 or something.\n\nSuppose at T=9, we are at y=0, then after action, at T=10, y=1, then to y=9 at T=18, same.\n\nIf we could be at y=5 at T=9, but we can't because at T=9, if on y=5, unsafe.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps at T=8, we are on y=0, safe, then at T=8, we take U to y9=1, but at T=9, y=1, unsafe, collision.\n\nSo we must not do that.\n\nTherefore, the only safe way is to be at y=0 at T=8 and T=9, then go up.\n\nSo minimal H=15.\n\nNow for the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify the actions.\n\nFrom above, one possible sequence:\n\nAt T=3: U (to y4=2)\n\nIn the action, at turn t, action a_t.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 3: a3 = U  (after action, position at T=4 is y=2)\n\nBut we need to output for turn t1=3, etc.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nSo for t=3: action\n\nThen t=4: action, etc.\n\nIn the sequence, at each turn, we output the action.\n\nAlso, for the position at that turn, before action, we are on y_t, and we take action a_t.\n\nBut in the collision, at turn T, we are on y_T, and check for that row at time T.\n\nIn our case, with the sequence:\n\nTurn 3: at y=1, take U, then y4=2\n\nTurn 4: at y=2, take U, y5=3\n\nTurn 5: at y=3, take D, y6=2\n\nTurn 6: at y=2, take D, y7=1\n\nTurn 7: at y=1, take D, y8=0\n\nTurn 8: at y=0, take S, y9=0\n\nTurn 9: at y=0, take U, y10=1\n\nTurn 10: at y=1, take U, y11=2\n\nTurn 11: at y=2, take U, y12=3\n\nTurn 12: at y=3, take U, y13=4\n\nTurn 13: at y=4, take U, y14=5\n\nTurn 14: at y=5, take U, y15=6\n\nTurn 15: at y=6, take U, y16=7\n\nTurn 16: at y=7, take U, y17=8\n\nTurn 17: at y=8, take U, y18=9\n\nNow, at which turn do we reach y=9? At turn 18, after a17.\n\nSo H=15 actions: from turn 3 to turn 17.\n\nNumber of actions: 15.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=3 to t=17.\n\nNow, check safety:\n\nAt each turn, position and time:\n\nT=3: y=1, row 1 safe (not occupied)\n\nT=4: y=2, row 2 safe (T=4 not 8 or 9)\n\nT=5: y=3, row 3 safe\n\nT=6: y=2, row 2 safe\n\nT=7: y=1, row 1 safe\n\nT=8: y=0, row 0, no cars, safe\n\nT=9: y=0, row 0, safe\n\nT=10: y=1, row 1 safe\n\n...\n\nUp to T=17: y=8, row 8 safe (T=17 not 3,8,9)\n\nT=18: y=9, safe, but at turn T=18, we are on y=9, no action, but we reached.\n\nIn the sequence, we don't have action at T=18, the last action is at T=17.\n\nAll safe.\n\nIs there a shorter sequence?\n\nSuppose we can be at higher y before the down.\n\nFor example, at T=3: U, y4=2\n\nT=4: U, y5=3\n\nT=5: U, y6=4\n\nBut then to go down, at T=6: D, y7=3\n\nT=7: D, y8=2, not 0.\n\nIf at T=5: after y5=3, take D, y6=2\n\nT=6: D, y7=1\n\nT=7: D, y8=0\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt T=3: take S or D immediately.\n\nBut if take D at T=3, y4=0\n\nThen we can go up from there, but then at T=8, we need to be at 0, so we must not go up or come back.\n\nFor example, T=3: D, y4=0\n\nT=4: U, y5=1\n\nT=5: U, y6=2\n\nT=6: U, y7=3\n\nT=7: D, y8=2? Not 0.\n\nTo have y8=0, from y7 must be 1 or 0.\n\nIf at T=7, y=1, take D to y8=0.\n\nBut from above, at T=4 y=0, if we take U to y5=1, U to y6=2, etc., we need to be at y=1 at T=7.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=3: D, y4=0\n\nT=4: S, y5=0 (stay)\n\nT=5: S, y6=0\n\nT=6: S, y7=0\n\nT=7: S, y8=0\n\nThen T=8: S, y9=0\n\nT=9: U, y10=1\n\nThen U to y18=9, same 15 actions, but with more S.\n\nWorse.\n\nT=3: D, y4=0\n\nT=4: U, y5=1\n\nT=5: U, y6=2\n\nT=6: D, y7=1\n\nT=7: D, y8=0\n\nThen T=8: S, y9=0\n\nT=9: U, y10=1\n\nThen U to y18=9, still 15 actions.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo no savings.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 15.\n\nNow for the sequence, in the output, we need to list the actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have at turn 5: D, which is down from y=3 to y=2, but row is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nBut in the car state, for rows 5-8, at T=3 it was occupied, but we are not on them at T=3.\n\nIn our sequence, we are on row 1 at T=3, safe.\n\nNow, the action sequence:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nAfter a17, at turn 18, y=9.\n\nH=15.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 9: U, to go up.\n\nBut turn 9 action is at turn 9, position y9=0, take U, to y10=1.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, is there a sequence with H=14?\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at T=17.\n\nThen y17=9, so at turn 17, position y=9.\n\nThen we must have reached earlier.\n\nBut from y=0 at T=9, to y=9 at T=17, that's 8 steps: from y=0 to y=9 in 8 actions? After 8 U, from y=0 to y=8 at T=9+8=17, y17=8, then need another U to y18=9.\n\nTo have y17=9, we need to be at y=9 at turn 17.\n\nFrom y=0 at T=9, after k actions, position at T=9+k.\n\nSet 9+k=17, k=8, y_{9+8} = y17 = 0 + 8 =8 if all U, then not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=17, we need y17=9.\n\nFrom y=0 at T=9, after 9 U actions: a9 to a17, 9 actions, y10=1, y11=2, ..., y18=9.\n\nSo y17=8, y18=9.\n\nCannot have y17=9 with fewer actions.\n\nIf we start from higher, but at T=9, we are at y=0.\n\nSo impossible to reach before T=18.\n\nThus minimal H=15.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to specify for the given turns.\n\nAlso, in the car state, all freeways have cars, but we avoided.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly to row 9 faster by being on row 9 at T=11, but we have to pass through the rows at T=8 and T=9.\n\nUnless we can be on row 8 at T=10 or something, but at T=8 and T=9, we must be off.\n\nI think it's not possible.\n\nSo I'll go with this.\n\nBut in the action at turn 5, we have D, but it might not be necessary, but in this case, it is to go down.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose we go down immediately.\n\nT=3: D, y4=0\n\nThen stay at 0 until T=9.\n\nT=4: S, y5=0\n\nT=5: S, y6=0\n\nT=6: S, y7=0\n\nT=7: S, y8=0\n\nT=8: S, y9=0\n\nThen T=9: U, y10=1\n\n...\n\nUp to T=17: U, y18=9\n\nActions: T=3: D, T=4:S, T=5:S, T=6:S, T=7:S, T=8:S, T=9:U, T10:U, ..., T17:U\n\nThat's 15 actions, but with more S, same H.\n\nWith the first sequence, we have fewer S.\n\nIn the first, only one S at T=8.\n\nIn this, many S.\n\nBut H same.\n\nSo the first sequence is fine.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nWe need to output the actions from turn 3 to turn 17.\n\nBut turn 17 is the last action.\n\nIn the box.\n\nAlso, the car state has multiple cars, but I think we covered.\n\nPerhaps for row 1, at T=3, is it safe? Yes, as per.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 6, we are at y=2, which is row 2, at T=6, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think ok.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 15. This sequence ensures that the player is not on any freeway row (1 to 8) at turns 8 and 9, when all freeway rows are occupied by cars at \\(x = 0\\), by moving to and staying on row \\(y = 0\\) (which has no cars and is safe) during those turns. After turn 9, the player moves directly up to row \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 3, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 2\\) at turn 4.\n- At turn 4, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 3\\) at turn 5.\n- At turn 5, move down (D) to reach \\(y = 2\\) at turn 6.\n- At turn 6, move down (D) to reach \\(y = 1\\) at turn 7.\n- At turn 7, move down (D) to reach \\(y = 0\\) at turn 8.\n- At turn 8, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 9.\n- At turn 9, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 1\\) at turn 10.\n- From turns 10 to 17, move up (U) each turn to incrementally reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 18.\n\nThis sequence avoids collisions because:\n- At turns 3 to 7, the player is on rows 1 to 2, which are safe except at turns 8 and 9 (but the player is not on these rows then).\n- At turns 8 and 9, the player is on row 0, which has no cars and is always safe.\n- At turns 10 to 17, the player is on rows 1 to 8, but these are safe except at turns 8 and 9 (which have passed).\n- At turn 18, the player reaches row 9, which has no cars and is safe.\n\nThe actions are listed for turns \\(t_1 + t\\) from \\(t = 0\\) to \\(H-1 = 14\\), corresponding to absolute turns 3 to 17.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) at turn 4 to (0,9) as quickly as possible without colliding with any cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0. Cars move left or right at their speeds, and I collide only if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y where for that y, at that turn T, 0 is within the span of a car on that freeway.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car positions over time since I need to avoid collisions when I'm on those freeways.\n\nAll cars are moving right with speed 6. For a car with head h, tail τ, since it's right-moving, the span at time t is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)], and collision if 0 is in that interval at the turn when I'm on that row.\n\nt1 is 4, so for any future turn T, the time elapsed is T - 4.\n\nLet Δt = T - 4, so at turn T, for a car with initial head h, tail τ at t1=4, the span is:\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + 6*Δt, h + 6*Δt]\n\nCollision on freeway k at turn T if I'm on y=k and 0 is in [τ + 6*Δt, h + 6*Δt] for some car on that freeway.\n\nSince the cars are on specific freeways, and I need to be on freeway y only when y between 1 and 8, I think. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, no cars there. The problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8\", so y=0 and y=9 should be fine, no cars.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is y=9, so that should be safe.\n\nNow, I start at y=2 at t=4.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to increase y by 7. Since I can only change by +1 per turn with U, the minimum moves would be 7 turns if I only go up, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 7.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the starting point? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1 for the actions, but here it's indexed from t1.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so at time t1 + t for t from 0 to H-1, so the actions are applied at times t1, t1+1, ..., up to t1 + H - 1.\n\nThen after H actions, at time t1 + H, the position should be (0,9)? Let's see.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at time t, action a_t is taken, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position is given at time t1: (0, y_{t1}) = (0,2)\n\nThen at time t1, we take action a_{t1}, which determines y_{t1 +1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\nSimilarly, at time t1+1, action a_{t1+1} determines y_{t1+2}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, the last action is at time t1 + H - 1, which determines y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nSo the position at time t1 + H should be (0,9).\n\nAnd we need to reach it in minimal H.\n\nNow, collisions are checked at each turn T when we are on y_T, which is between 1 and 8, and we collide if 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at that turn T.\n\nImportant note: when we move, at turn T, if we are on y_T and we move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, we are still on y_T, so we care about cars on y_T at turn T. And at turn T, we are not yet on y_{T+1}, so cars on y_{T+1} at turn T don't affect us, even if they might be at 0 at turn T but not at T+1.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, we only care about the freeway we are currently on at each turn.\n\nNow, let's list the car states at t1=4.\n\nFor each freeway k, cars are given.\n\nFreeway 1: two cars: (-24,-35, right,6) and (24,13, right,6)\n\nDirection is given as \"right\" for all, I think d is direction.\n\nIn the table, it says \"direction d\", and for all, it's right.\n\nAlso, for the first car, head h=-24, tail τ=-35? That seems odd.\n\nLet me read the car update.\n\nFor left-moving: span [h, τ] -> [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nFor right-moving: span [τ, h] -> [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]? No.\n\nThe notation is a bit messy.\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nBut [h, τ] with h and τ, but in the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nIn the table, it's (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ], and since left-moving, as time increases, it moves left, so both h and τ decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h]? Let's see.\n\n\"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nYes, so for right-moving, at t1, span is from τ to h, with τ <= h I assume, and it increases with time.\n\nIn the car state, for right-moving, head h and tail τ, with τ being the left end, h the right end? Not necessarily, because in the notation, for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is the start, h is the end, so τ <= h.\n\nBut in the given data, for example, freeway 1: (-24,-35,right,6), so τ = -35, h = -24? That can't be right because -35 < -24, so τ = -35, h = -24, but -35 < -24, so [τ, h] = [-35, -24], which is from -35 to -24, so tail at -35, head at -24? But tail should be behind, so for right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so if τ = -35, h = -24, then tail at -35, head at -24, so span [-35,-24], and moving right.\n\nBut -35 to -24, that's correct, τ = -35, h = -24, τ < h.\n\nSimilarly, the other car (24,13,right,6), 13 and 24, τ=13, h=24? 13<24, so [13,24].\n\nτ=13, h=24, so [13,24].\n\nIn the pair, it's (head, tail), I think? Let's see the notation.\n\n\" Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s) \"\n\nIn the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 6) and (24, 13, right, 6)\n\nSo for first car: head = -24, tail = -35? Head and tail, with direction.\n\nFor right-moving, head should be the front, so if moving right, head is right, tail is left, so head > tail.\n\nHere head = -24, tail = -35, since -24 > -35, so head at -24, tail at -35, span [tail, head] = [-35, -24] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=24, tail=13, span [13,24] at t1.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nNow for freeway 5: (-24,-35,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (48,37,right,6)\n\nFor (48,37,right,6), head=48, tail=37, so span [37,48] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, (12,1,right,6) span [1,12], and (-24,-35,right,6) span [-35,-24].\n\nNow, I need to find when 0 is occupied on each freeway for each turn.\n\nSince all cars are moving right at speed 6, and we care about when 0 is in the span for some car on a freeway.\n\nFor a given freeway k, at turn T, with Δt = T - 4, the span for a car is [τ + 6*Δt, h + 6*Δt] for right-moving car.\n\n0 is occupied if there exists a car on that freeway such that τ + 6*Δt <= 0 <= h + 6*Δt.\n\nSimilarly for all cars on that row.\n\nNow, since multiple cars, but we care if at least one covers 0.\n\nAlso, for each freeway, I need to find for which Δt, 0 is covered.\n\nBut Δt is integer since turns are discrete.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and find when 0 is in some span.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: cars: car A: τ=-35, h=-24; car B: τ=13, h=24\n\nSpan at Δt: car A: [-35 + 6Δt, -24 + 6Δt]\n\nCar B: [13 + 6Δt, 24 + 6Δt]\n\n0 in car A span: -35 + 6Δt <= 0 <= -24 + 6Δt\n\nWhich is 6Δt <= 35 and 6Δt >= 24? Let's solve.\n\n-35 + 6Δt <= 0 <= -24 + 6Δt\n\nLeft: -35 + 6Δt <= 0 => 6Δt <= 35 => Δt <= 35/6 = 5.833, so since Δt integer, Δt <= 5\n\nRight: 0 <= -24 + 6Δt => 6Δt >= 24 => Δt >= 4\n\nSo for car A, 0 covered when 4 <= Δt <= 5\n\nNow car B: 13 + 6Δt <= 0 <= 24 + 6Δt\n\nLeft: 13 + 6Δt <= 0 => 6Δt <= -13, impossible since Δt >=0\n\nRight: 0 <= 24 + 6Δt, always true for Δt >=0, but left inequality 13+6Δt <=0 is false, so 0 not in car B span for any Δt, because the span starts at 13+6Δt >=13 >0, so 0 always left of span.\n\nSimilarly, for car A, at Δt=4: span [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0], so 0 is included? -11 to 0, so 0 is the right end, and since it's closed interval, I assume, 0 is included.\n\nThe span is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt], and it includes the endpoints, I think, for collision.\n\nSimilarly, at Δt=4: car A span: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0], so 0 is in [-11,0], yes.\n\nAt Δt=5: [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6], 0 in [-5,6], yes.\n\nAt Δt=6: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12].\n\nSimilarly, car B span at Δt=4: [13+24,24+24]=[37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 1 has collision at Δt=4 and Δt=5, i.e., turns T=4+4=8 and T=4+5=9.\n\nT = t1 + Δt = 4 + Δt.\n\nAt T=8, Δt=4; T=9, Δt=5.\n\nNow freeway 2: same cars as freeway 1: (-24,-35,right,6) and (24,13,right,6), same as above, so collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3: same, collision at T=8,9.\n\nFreeway 4: same, collision at T=8,9.\n\nNow freeway 5: cars: (-24,-35,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (48,37,right,6)\n\nFirst car same as before: τ=-35, h=-24, so 0 covered for 4<= Δt <=5\n\nSecond car: τ=1, h=12? Head=12, tail=1, so span at Δt: [1 + 6Δt, 12 + 6Δt]\n\n0 in span: 1 + 6Δt <= 0 <= 12 + 6Δt\n\nLeft: 1+6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <= -1, impossible\n\nRight: 0 <=12+6Δt always true, but left false, so never, since span starts at 1+6Δt >=1>0.\n\nThird car: (48,37,right,6), head=48, tail=37, span [37+6Δt,48+6Δt], all positive, so 0 not covered.\n\nSo for freeway 5, only the first car matters, collision when 4<= Δt <=5, T=8 and 9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same cars as freeway 5? Freeway 6 has (-24,-35,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (48,37,right,6), same as freeway 5.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same.\n\nFreeway 8: same.\n\nAll freeways have similar cars, but let's confirm.\n\nFreeway 1 to 4: two cars: (-24,-35) and (24,13)\n\nFreeway 5 to 8: three cars: (-24,-35), (12,1), (48,37)\n\nBut for collision, for freeway 1-4, only the first car causes collision at T=8,9.\n\nFor freeway 5-8, also only the (-24,-35) car causes collision at T=8,9, because other cars don't cover 0.\n\nFor freeway 5, car (12,1): at Δt=0, span [1,12], min=1>0; at Δt=1, [7,18], etc., always min >=1>0, so 0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly car (48,37) min=37>0.\n\nSo yes, for all freeways y=1 to 8, there is a car that covers 0 at exactly turns T=8 and T=9.\n\nAt T=8 (Δt=4) and T=9 (Δt=5).\n\nAt other times, no collision on any freeway? Not necessarily, for example, at earlier or later times, but let's see.\n\nFor freeway 1, car A: only at Δt=4,5.\n\nAt Δt=3: span [-35+18, -24+18] = [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=6: [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for other cars, no coverage.\n\nBut for freeway 5, same, only car A matters.\n\nSo for all rows y=1 to 8, at exactly turns 8 and 9, if I am on that row, I collide.\n\nAt other turns, no collision on any row.\n\nIs that right?\n\nWhat about row 5, car (12,1): at Δt=0, [1,12], not cover 0; but at some point, if Δt negative, but Δt >=0, so no.\n\nSimilarly, only T=8 and T=9 are problematic for all rows 1-8.\n\nBut only if I am on the row at that turn.\n\nNow, I start at t=4, y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is also safe.\n\nNow, the dangerous turns are only T=8 and T=9.\n\nAt other turns, I can be on any row without issue.\n\nNow, since I need to go from y=2 to y=9, which is +7 in y, minimum 7 turns if I go up every turn.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, I must not be on rows 1-8, so I must be on y=0 or y=9 at those turns.\n\ny=9 is the goal, so if I can reach y=9 before or at T=8, I might be safe, but let's see the timing.\n\nLet t be absolute time.\n\nt=4: start y=2\n\nAction at t=4 determines y_{5}, and so on.\n\nPosition at time t is y_t.\n\nCollision checked at each t for y_t.\n\nDangerous t: t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=8 and t=9, if y_t is between 1 and 8, collide.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nAt other times, all rows safe.\n\nI need y_{t1 + H} = y_{4 + H} =9.\n\nH is number of actions, from t=4 to t=4+H-1, so position at time t=4+H is y_{4+H} =9.\n\nThe actions: at time τ, action a_τ for τ from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nThe time when position is set: at time t, y_t is position.\n\nFor collision at time t, we look at y_t.\n\nt1=4, so times t=4,5,6,... up to when we reach y=9.\n\nAt t=4, we are at y=2, and we take action a_4 to go to y_5, etc.\n\nThe dangerous times are t=8 and t=9.\n\nI need to ensure that at t=8 and t=9, I am not on y=1 to 8.\n\nSo either on y=0 or y=9.\n\ny=9 is the target, so if I reach y=9 before t=8, then at t=8 and t=9 I am on y=9, safe.\n\nIf not, I might need to go to y=0 temporarily.\n\nNow, from y=2 at t=4, I can go up.\n\nMinimum time to y=9: if I go up every turn, I need to increase by 7, so from t=4, after k up moves, y_{4+k} = 2 + k.\n\nSet 2 + k =9, so k=7, so at time t=4+7=11, y_{11}=9.\n\nBut actions: at t=4, action U, y5=3; at t=5, U, y6=4; ... at t=10, U, y11=9.\n\nSo position at t=11 is y=9.\n\nBut the dangerous times are t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=8, where am I?\n\nt=4: y4=2\n\na4: say U, y5=3\n\na5: U, y6=4\n\na6: U, y7=5\n\na7: U, y8=6\n\nAt t=8, y8=6, which is between 1 and 8, and t=8 is dangerous, so I would collide.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up, at t=8, y8= y4 + number of up from t=4 to t=7? Let's see.\n\nPosition at time t:\n\nt=4: y4=2\n\nAfter action at t=4: y5 = y4 + Δy4\n\nGenerally, y_{t} for t>4 depends on actions from t=4 to t-1.\n\nSpecifically, y_t = y4 + sum_{i=4}^{t-1} Δy_i\n\nAnd Δy_i = +1 if U, -1 if D, 0 if S.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=2, need net +7 in the sum.\n\nWith minimal turns, but with constraints.\n\nIn the direct up path: actions at t=4,5,6,7,8,9,10 all U.\n\nThen y5=3, y6=4, y7=5, y8=6, y9=7, y10=8, y11=9.\n\nAt t=8, y8=6, which is row 6, collide because t=8 dangerous.\n\nSimilarly at t=9, y9=7, row 7, collide.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on rows 1-8 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nOptions:\n\n1. Reach y=9 before t=8.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at time t, I need to have started from t=4 and gained 7 in y.\n\nEarliest at t=11, as above. y_{11}=9 if all U from t=4 to t=10.\n\nBut t=11 is after t=9, so at t=8 and t=9 I am still below 9.\n\nCan I reach earlier? No, because y_{t} <= 2 + (t-4) for t>4, since each action can increase by at most 1.\n\ny_t = 2 + number of U minus number of D from i=4 to t-1.\n\nMax y_t at time t is 2 + (t-4), if all U.\n\nSo at t=8, max y8 = 2 + (8-4) = 2+4=6, as above.\n\nAt t=9, max y9=2+5=7.\n\nAt t=10, max y10=2+6=8.\n\nAt t=11, max y11=2+7=9.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 before t=11.\n\nThus, I cannot be on y=9 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nTherefore, to avoid collision at t=8 and t=9, I must be on y=0 at those times.\n\ny=0 is safe.\n\nSo I need to be at y=0 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nBut I also need to reach y=9 eventually.\n\nNow, since at t=8 and t=9 I need to be on y=0, I can go down to y=0 before t=8 and stay or something.\n\nBut I start from y=2 at t=4.\n\nNow, let's list the times:\n\nt=4: y4=2\n\nt=5: y5, after a4\n\n...\n\nup to t=8 and t=9 must be y=0.\n\nThen after that, go to y=9.\n\nSince y=0 at t=8, and I need to go to y=9, which is +9, so from t=8 onwards, I need to increase y by 9 to reach y=9.\n\nBut at t=8 I am at y=0, then I need to get to y=9.\n\nEach U increases by 1, so minimum 9 actions to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nActions from t=8 to t=16, y9 to y17? Let's see.\n\nAt time t=8, y8=0.\n\nThen action a8: if U, y9=1; ... after k U, y_{8+k} = k.\n\nSet k=9, y_{17}=9.\n\nBut H is the number of actions to reach y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nt1=4, so y_{4+H} =9.\n\nNow, if at t=8, y8=0, then y_{4+H} =9.\n\nThe time from t=8 to t=4+H.\n\ny_{4+H} = y8 + sum_{i=8}^{4+H-1} Δy_i\n\nBut y8=0, so 0 + net increase to 9, so at least 9 actions needed from t=8 onwards? Actions from t=8 to t=4+H-1.\n\nThe actions are from time t=4 to t=4+H-1.\n\nPosition at time t=4+H is y_{4+H}=9.\n\nNow, at time t=8, position y8.\n\nIf y8=0, then from t=8 to t=4+H, the change in position is y_{4+H} - y8 =9 - 0 =9.\n\nNumber of steps from t=8 to t=4+H is (4+H) - 8 = H-4.\n\nEach step, y can change by -1,0,+1, so the net change over K steps is at most K, so to gain 9, need at least 9 steps.\n\nThus, from t=8 to t=4+H, there are (4+H) - 8 = H-4 steps (actions at t=8 to t=4+H-1, which affect y9 to y_{4+H}).\n\nThe positions: from y8 to y_{4+H}, there are (4+H) - 8 = H-4 intervals, each with an action.\n\nThe net change is y_{4+H} - y8 =9 - 0 =9.\n\nSince each action changes y by at most +1, the number of actions from t=8 to t=4+H-1 must be at least 9, and net +9 requires all U, no D or S.\n\nNumber of actions from t=8 to t=4+H-1 inclusive is (4+H-1) - 8 +1 = (4+H-1) -7 = H-4? Let's calculate indices.\n\nActions at times: t=8, t=9, ..., up to t=4+H-1.\n\nFirst action: t=8, last action: t=4+H-1.\n\nNumber of actions: (4+H-1) - 8 +1 = 4+H-1-8+1 = H-4.\n\nFor example, if H=12, actions t=4 to 15, position at t=16=9? t=4+H=4+12=16.\n\nActions t=8 to 15, number: 15-8+1=8 actions? t=8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15, that's 8 actions affecting y9 to y16.\n\ny8 to y16, 8 steps, net change y16 - y8.\n\nIf y8=0, y16=9, net +9 over 8 actions, which is possible only if all U, since max +1 per action.\n\ny16 - y8 = sum_{i=8}^{15} Δy_i\n\nEach Δy_i <=1, so sum <= number of actions = 8, but 9 >8, impossible.\n\ny_{4+H} - y8 =9\n\ny_{4+H} - y8 = sum_{k=8}^{4+H-1} Δy_k\n\nNumber of terms: from k=8 to k=4+H-1 inclusive.\n\nNumber of k: (4+H-1) - 8 +1 = 4+H-1-8+1 = H-4\n\nEach Δy_k <=1, so y_{4+H} - y8 <= H-4\n\nBut y_{4+H} - y8 =9 - 0 =9, so 9 <= H-4, thus H >=13.\n\nSimilarly, if y8=0, then to reach y_{4+H}=9, we need H-4 >=9, so H>=13.\n\nBut earlier with direct up, H=7, but with collision.\n\nNow, if I am not at y=0 at t=8, but I need to avoid rows 1-8 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nI could be at y=9, but as we saw, impossible before t=11.\n\nSo only option is to be at y=0 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, I also need to be at y=0 or y=9.\n\nIf at t=8 I am at y=0, I can stay or move.\n\nBut to minimize H, probably I should go to y=0 as fast as possible, then after t=9, go up to y=9.\n\nSince I need to be at y=0 at t=8 and t=9, I can be at y=0 from some time before.\n\nNow, I start at y=2 at t=4.\n\nI need to get to y=0 by t=8 at latest.\n\nSince I can go down, I can reach y=0 quickly.\n\nFor example, at t=4, if I go down, y5=1; then down again, y6=0; etc.\n\nBut I need to be at y=0 at t=8 and t=9 specifically.\n\nt=8 and t=9 must have y=0.\n\nNow, the path:\n\nFrom t=4 to t=8, I need to go from y=2 to y=0, which is net decrease of 2.\n\nBut I have multiple turns.\n\nI can spend some turns waiting or moving.\n\nBut to minimize H, I should not waste turns.\n\nH is from t=4 to t=4+H-1 actions, to reach at t=4+H.\n\nSince I need to be at y=0 at t=8 and t=9, and then go to y=9.\n\nAfter t=9, I can go up.\n\nThe dangerous times are only t=8 and t=9, so before and after, I can move freely.\n\nSo, from t=4 to t=8, I need to reach y=0 by t=8.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, I must be y=0.\n\nThen from t=9 onwards, I need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, to reach y=0 from y=2: I can go down twice.\n\nFor example, at t=4, D, y5=1\n\nt=5, D, y6=0\n\nThen at t=6, I am at y6=0.\n\nNow at t=6, I can stay or move, but since no danger except t=8,9, and y=0 is safe, I can stay at y=0 until t=9.\n\nt=8 and t=9 I need to be at y=0.\n\nSo from t=6 to t=9, I can be at y=0.\n\ny6=0, then at t=6, if I do S, y7=0\n\nt=7, S, y8=0\n\nt=8, S, y9=0\n\nThen at t=9, y9=0, safe.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9 from y=0.\n\nAt t=9, y9=0, action a9 to go to y10.\n\nThen I need to reach y_{4+H} =9.\n\ny_{4+H} = y9 + sum_{k=9}^{4+H-1} Δy_k = 0 + net to 9.\n\nNumber of actions from t=9 to t=4+H-1: (4+H-1) - 9 +1 = 4+H-1-9+1 = H-5\n\nEach action can increase by at most 1, so net <= H-5, set equal to 9, so H-5 >=9, H>=14.\n\nThen y_{4+H} =9.\n\nFor example, H=14, then actions from t=4 to t=17 (since t1+H-1=4+14-1=17), position at t=18=9.\n\ny_{4+H} = y_{18} =9.\n\nNow, from y9=0 to y18=9, actions at t=9 to t=17, 9 actions: if all U, y10=1, y11=2, ..., y18=9, yes.\n\nBut H=14.\n\nIn the above, I used actions to go down early.\n\nI could go down later to y=0.\n\nBut I need to be at y=0 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSince t=8 and t=9 are consecutive, I need to be at y=0 for both turns, so I must be at y=0 at least from t=8 to t=9, meaning that at t=8 I am y=0, and action at t=8 should keep me at y=0 or move, but since I need y9=0, so if at t=8 y8=0, then to have y9=0, I must do S at t=8 or U/D but U would make y9=1, not 0, D would make y9=-1, invalid, y must be in 0-9.\n\ny_{t+1} in [0,9], so from y=0, if I do D, y_{t+1} = -1, which is invalid, so I cannot go below 0, similarly above 9.\n\nSo from y=0, I can only do U or S, not D.\n\nSimilarly, from y=9, only D or S, not U.\n\nIn this case, from y=0, to stay at y=0, I must do S.\n\nIf I do U, I go to y=1.\n\nSimilarly, to have y9=0, since y8=0, I must do S at t=8, so y9=0.\n\nIf y8=0 and I do U at t=8, y9=1, which at t=9 is dangerous if on row 1-8.\n\nBut t=9 dangerous, y9=1 collide.\n\nSo indeed, if at y=0 at t=8, I must do S to stay at y=0 for t=9.\n\nSimilarly, I could be at y=9 at t=8 and t=9, but impossible as before.\n\nSo only option is y=0 at t=8 and S at t=8 to have y9=0.\n\nThen after t=9, go up.\n\nNow back to minimizing H.\n\nI need to reach y=0 by t=8.\n\nAt t=4, y4=2.\n\nI need y8=0.\n\nThe change from y4 to y8: y8 = y4 + sum_{i=4}^{7} Δy_i = 2 + sum_{i=4 to 7} Δy_i\n\nSet y8=0, so 2 + sum_{i=4 to 7} Δy_i =0, so sum Δy_i from i=4 to7 = -2.\n\nNow, each Δy_i can be -1,0,+1.\n\nTo make sum -2, I need net two down moves in the actions at t=4,5,6,7.\n\nFor example, I can do two D and two S, or one D and three S but sum -1, not -2, etc.\n\nMinimal actions: I need at least two down moves.\n\nI can do it in different orders.\n\nBut since I want to minimize total H, I should not delay the down moves, but also, after t=9, I need to go up.\n\nIn terms of time, from t=4 to t=8, I have actions at t=4,5,6,7 to affect y5 to y8.\n\ny8 is determined by actions up to t=7.\n\nThen at t=8, action affects y9.\n\nBut for y8, it is set by actions from t=4 to t=7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo have y8=0, and y9=0.\n\nNow, let's list the sequence.\n\nFirst, from t=4 to t=7, I need sum of four Δy_i = -2, since y8 = 2 + sum_{i=4}^7 Δy_i =0.\n\ny8 = y4 + sum_{k=4}^{7} Δy_k\n\nΔy_k is action at time k, affects y_{k+1}, but y8 is position at time 8.\n\ny8 = y4 + Δy4 + Δy5 + Δy6 + Δy7? Let's see:\n\ny5 = y4 + Δy4\n\ny6 = y5 + Δy5 = y4 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\ny7 = y6 + Δy6 = y4 + Δy4 + Δy5 + Δy6\n\ny8 = y7 + Δy7 = y4 + Δy4 + Δy5 + Δy6 + Δy7\n\nSo y8 = 2 + Δy4 + Δy5 + Δy6 + Δy7\n\nSet to 0, so Δy4 + Δy5 + Δy6 + Δy7 = -2\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1.\n\nSimilarly, for y9: y9 = y8 + Δy8\n\nAnd we want y9=0, so since y8=0, Δy8 must be 0, so S at t=8.\n\nThen after that, go up to y=9.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I need to minimize the time to reach y=9 after t=9.\n\ny9=0, then I need y_{4+H} =9.\n\ny_{4+H} = y9 + sum_{k=9}^{4+H-1} Δy_k = 0 + net to 9\n\nNumber of actions from t=9 to t=4+H-1: as before, H-5 actions (since t=9 to t=4+H-1, number: (4+H-1) -9 +1 = H-5)\n\nNet change +9, so need at least 9 up moves, and no down moves, so must have exactly 9 U actions from t=9 to t=4+H-1, and H-5 >=9, H>=14.\n\nAnd since net +9, if I do only U, it takes exactly 9 actions, so H-5=9, H=14.\n\nThen actions from t=9 to t=4+14-1=17, t=9 to 17, 9 actions, all U, y10=1, y11=2, ..., y18=9.\n\nNow, back to the beginning: from t=4 to t=7, I need sum of four Δy = -2.\n\nI can do, for example, two D and two S, in some order.\n\nSince I want to save time, but I have to wait until after t=9 to go up, so going down early or late doesn't affect the total H, as long as I reach y=0 by t=8.\n\nIn fact, I can go down immediately.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt t=4: D, then y5 = y4 + Δy4 = 2 + (-1) =1? Action a4 at t=4, Δy4, so y5 = y4 + Δy4.\n\nIf a4=D, Δy4=-1, y5=2-1=1\n\nThen at t=5: D, a5=D, Δy5=-1, y6=1-1=0\n\nThen at t=6: since y6=0, I can do S or U.\n\nBut I need to be at y=0 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=6, y6=0, I can do S to stay.\n\nSimilarly at t=7.\n\nThen at t=8, S to stay.\n\nBut let's list:\n\nt=4: action D, y5=1\n\nt=5: action D, y6=0\n\nNow at t=6: action, I need y7 and y8.\n\ny7 = y6 + Δy6\n\nIf I do S at t=6, Δy6=0, y7=0+0=0\n\nSimilarly, at t=7: S, Δy7=0, y8=0+0=0\n\nThen at t=8: action, to have y9=0, since y8=0, I must do S, so a8=S, y9=0\n\nThen from t=9: start going up.\n\nBut at t=9, y9=0, action a9=U, y10=1\n\na10=U, y11=2\n\n...\n\nup to a17=U, y18=9\n\nNow, actions from t=4 to t=17, that's 14 actions: t=4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17\n\nt=4 to 17 inclusive: 17-4+1=14 actions.\n\nPosition at t=18=9.\n\nH=14.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nH=14 seems necessary because from y=0 at t=9 to y=9, it takes at least 9 turns.\n\nBut do I have to be at y=0 at t=9?\n\nI could be at y=9 at t=9, but impossible, as before.\n\nAfter t=9, I can start going up immediately, but I need to be safe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I don't need to be at y=0 both turns, but since t=8 and t=9 are separate, I need to avoid 1-8 on both.\n\nBut y=0 or y=9 are the only options.\n\ny=9 not possible, so y=0.\n\nPerhaps I can be at different rows, but no, only y=0 or y=9 safe at t=8,9.\n\nBut y=9 not achievable, so must be y=0.\n\nThus H=14 seems minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if there are other dangerous times.\n\nEarlier I concluded that only t=8 and t=9 are dangerous for all rows.\n\nBut is that true for all freeways?\n\nFor example, freeway 5 has cars at (12,1) and (48,37), but as we saw, they never cover 0.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 5 car (12,1): head=12, tail=1, right-moving, span at Δt: [1 + 6Δt, 12 + 6Δt]\n\nMin is 1 + 6Δt >=1 >0 for all Δt>=0, so 0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly (48,37) min 37>0.\n\nAnd (-24,-35) as before, only Δt=4,5.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 1-4 same.\n\nSo yes, only t=8 and t=9 dangerous.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 14.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to specify actions from t=4 to t=17.\n\nIn the sequence, actions a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to 13 for H=14? Let's see.\n\nt1=4, H=14, actions at t=4 + t for t=0 to 13, so times 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17.\n\nt=0: t1+0=4, up to t1+13=17.\n\nThen position at t=18=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to write for each turn.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t: a_t\n\nSo for turn 4,5,6,...,17.\n\nNow, one possible sequence: as above.\n\nTo reach y=0 by t=8, with sum Δy from t=4 to t=7 = -2.\n\nI can do D at t=4 and t=5, then S at t=6 and t=7, then S at t=8, then U from t=9 to t=17.\n\nBut t=17 action to y18.\n\nActions:\n\nt=4: D, y5=1\n\nt=5: D, y6=0\n\nt=6: S, y7=0\n\nt=7: S, y8=0\n\nt=8: S, y9=0\n\nt=9: U, y10=1\n\nt=10: U, y11=2\n\nt=11: U, y12=3\n\nt=12: U, y13=4\n\nt=13: U, y14=5\n\nt=14: U, y15=6\n\nt=15: U, y16=7\n\nt=16: U, y17=8\n\nt=17: U, y18=9\n\ny_{t1 + H} = y_{4+14}=y18=9, yes.\n\nAt t=8, y8=0, safe.\n\nt=9, y9=0, safe.\n\nOther times, no issue.\n\nBut I could go down later, but same H.\n\nFor example, at t=4: S, y5=2\n\nt=5: S, y6=2\n\nt=6: D, y7=1\n\nt=7: D, y8=0\n\nThen t=8: S, y9=0\n\nThen same up from t=9 to t=17.\n\nStill 14 actions.\n\nBut in this case, at t=6 and t=7, I was at y=2 and y=1, but since no danger, fine.\n\nBut H same.\n\nNow, is there a way to have smaller H?\n\nSuppose I don't go all the way to y=0, but I have to, because at t=8 and t=9, if I am on y=1-8, I collide.\n\nPerhaps I can be on different safe rows, but there are no other safe rows at t=8,9; all 1-8 are occupied.\n\nUnless for some freeways it's safe, but no, all have collision at t=8,9.\n\nFor example, at t=8, Δt=4, for a car like (-24,-35), span [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], which includes 0.\n\nSimilarly all rows.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 faster by not going down, but I can't because I would be on middle rows at t=8,9.\n\nAnother idea: what if at t=8 I am on y=0, but at t=9 I go up immediately, but at t=9, if I am on y=1, I collide.\n\nSo I must be on y=0 at t=9.\n\nThus, I think H=14 is minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm the number.\n\nStart at t=4, y=2.\n\nAfter actions, at t=18, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: 14 actions from t=4 to t=17.\n\nt=4 to t=17 inclusive: 14 actions.\n\ny_{18}=9.\n\nThe minimal H.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up a bit, but then I have to come down, which might take more turns.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=4: U, y5=3\n\nBut then I am higher, but to be at y=0 at t=8, I need to come down more, net from y=2 to y=0 over 4 actions, sum Δy = -2, same as before.\n\nIf I go up first, say to y=4, then down to y=0, but I have only from t=4 to t=7 to change.\n\nFor example, at t=4: U, y5=3\n\nt=5: U, y6=4\n\nThen to y8=0, so from y6=4 to y8=0 in two actions: at t=6 and t=7.\n\ny8 = y6 + Δy6 + Δy7\n\nSet y8=0, y6=4, so 4 + Δy6 + Δy7 =0, so Δy6 + Δy7 = -4, but each at most -1, so max decrease -2, impossible to reach 0 from 4 in two steps; min y8=4-2=2 if both D.\n\ny7 = y6 + Δy6 <=4-1=3 if D, then y8 <=3-1=2 if D, so y8 >=2 if I go up first, cannot reach y=0 by t=8 if I go up.\n\nWith actions from t=4 to t=7, four actions, y8 can be from 2 -4 = -2 invalid, but constrained to [0,9], so min y8: if all D, y5=1, y6=0, y7=0 (if S after), but y7: if y6=0, cannot D, so min y7=0, y8=0.\n\nSimilarly, max y8=6 as before.\n\nBut to have y8=0, I must have gone down to 0 at some point, like by t=6 or t=7.\n\nBut in any case, with sum of four Δy = -2, it's possible only with at least two D, and the y stays within range.\n\nBut H is fixed at 14.\n\nThus, minimal H is 14.\n\nNow for the sequence, I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be for turns starting from t1=4.\n\nAlso, in the car state, all freeways have similar cars, but I think I covered.\n\nBut let me write the sequence.\n\nOne possible minimal sequence:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 4: D  (y5=1)\n\nTurn 5: D  (y6=0)\n\nTurn 6: S  (y7=0)\n\nTurn 7: S  (y8=0)\n\nTurn 8: S  (y9=0)\n\nTurn 9: U  (y10=1)\n\nTurn 10: U (y11=2)\n\nTurn 11: U (y12=3)\n\nTurn 12: U (y13=4)\n\nTurn 13: U (y14=5)\n\nTurn 14: U (y15=6)\n\nTurn 15: U (y16=7)\n\nTurn 16: U (y17=8)\n\nTurn 17: U (y18=9)\n\nIn the sequence, turns from 4 to 17, 14 actions.\n\nAt turn 6: S, y7=0; turn 7: S, y8=0; turn 8: S, y9=0.\n\nFrom turn 9 to 17: all U, 9 actions, to y10=1 to y18=9.\n\ny18=9, reached.\n\nNow, at t=8 and t=9, y=0, safe.\n\nOther times, no cars except t=8,9, so safe.\n\nBut at t=10 to t=17, I am on rows 1 to 8, but since no dangerous times except t=8,9, it should be fine.\n\nFor example, at t=10, Δt=10-4=6, for cars, on row y=1, but at Δt=6, car on row1: span for car A: [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], 0 not in, so safe; similarly others.\n\nNo issue.\n\nThus, this should work.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have turn 6 and 7 as S, but I could make them U or something, but I need to stay at 0, so S is fine.\n\nTo make it consistent, but H is same.\n\nAnother sequence: I could go down later.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 4: S (y5=2)\n\nTurn 5: S (y6=2)\n\nTurn 6: D (y7=1)\n\nTurn 7: D (y8=0)  // y8=0\n\nThen turn 8: S (y9=0)\n\nThen turn 9 to 17: U, same as before.\n\nBut turn 17 action, y18=9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 6: D from y6=2 to y7=1; turn 7: D to y8=0.\n\ny7=1 at t=7, which is safe since t=7 not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly fine.\n\nBut H same.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the format, it should be like:\n\nTurn 4: a_{4}\n\nTurn 5: a_{5}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 17.\n\nH=14, so from t=4 to t=17.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose I go up after t=9 faster, but I need 9 steps to go from y=0 to y=9, so no.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=0 only at t=8, but at t=9, if I could be at y=9, impossible.\n\nOr, another thought: at t=9, if I am not on 1-8, but y=0 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 not possible, so must y=0.\n\nThus, I think it's fine.\n\nSo minimal H=14.\n\nNow for the sequence, I'll use the first one.\n\nBut in the output, it should be the actions.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 5-8, there is an extra car, but it doesn't affect, as we saw.\n\nSo, I think.\n\nThus, the sequence:\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 14. The sequence of actions must ensure that the player is not on any freeway \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at turns 8 and 9, as these are the only dangerous turns where collisions occur (due to cars covering position 0 on all freeways). The only safe positions at these turns are \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y = 9\\), but \\(y = 9\\) is not achievable by turn 9. Therefore, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at both turns 8 and 9.\n\nThe sequence is designed as follows:\n- From turn 4 to turn 5, move down twice to reach \\(y = 0\\) by turn 6.\n- From turn 6 to turn 8, stay at \\(y = 0\\) to avoid collisions at turns 8 and 9.\n- From turn 9 to turn 17, move up nine times to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 18.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 14\\) turns (actions from turn 4 to turn 17), with the position at turn 18 being (0, 9). No shorter sequence is possible because:\n- Reaching \\(y = 9\\) requires a net increase of 7 in the \\(y\\)-coordinate from the start (turn 4, \\(y = 2\\)).\n- However, being at \\(y = 0\\) at turns 8 and 9 necessitates a net decrease of 2 from turn 4 to turn 8, and then a net increase of 9 from turn 9 to the end.\n- The minimum turns to increase \\(y\\) by 9 from \\(y = 0\\) is 9, leading to \\(H \\geq 14\\).\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: D \\\\\nTurn 5: D \\\\\nTurn 6: S \\\\\nTurn 7: S \\\\\nTurn 8: S \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 5, and I start at y=1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movement. All cars are moving right with speed 6. For each car, the span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). Since they're moving right, the head is the right end, and tail is the left end. Let me confirm that.\n\nFrom the car update: for right-moving, span at t₁ is [τ, h], and at time T, it's [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]. So yes, for right-moving cars, the head h is the right end, and tail τ is the left end. Similarly for left, but all here are right-moving.\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed). So for right-moving, h is the right end, τ is left end.\n\nFor example, on freeway 1: two cars: (-18, -29, right, 6) and (30, 19, right, 6).\n\nLet me parse this.\n\nFirst car: head h = -18, tail τ = -29? That seems odd because usually we expect head to be greater than tail for right-moving, but -18 > -29, so h = -18, τ = -29, so the car is from x= -29 to x= -18? That would be length 11, I think.\n\nSpan: from τ to h, so if τ = -29, h = -18, then it's from -29 to -18, which is moving right, so at time T, position is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] = [-29 + 6(T-5), -18 + 6(T-5)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=30, τ=19, so from 19 to 30? τ=19, h=30, so [19,30] at t₁=5.\n\nBut τ should be left, h right, so for right-moving, τ is smaller number, h larger.\n\nIn the first car, τ=-29, h=-18, so -29 < -18, so left to right, moving right.\n\nSimilarly, second car τ=19, h=30, 19<30, moving right.\n\nBut on freeway 1, both cars: one from -29 to -18, other from 19 to 30 at t=5.\n\nNow, collision happens only if at turn T, the player is at y=k, and for that freeway k, at time T, 0 is in the span of some car, meaning the car covers x=0 at that time.\n\nThe condition is: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\n\nAnd y_T is the player's y-position at turn T.\n\nAlso, when you move, you are not on the new row until the next turn. Let me read that note.\n\n\"If you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on row y_T. If you move to a different row, at turn T you are still on y_T, and at turn T+1 you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, we check the cars on row y_T at time T.\n\nSpecifically, if for that row, at time T, there is a car such that 0 is in its span, then collision.\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,1) at turn t=5.\n\nI need to reach (0,9) as soon as possible.\n\nThe actions are U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same), and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nSince I start at y=1 and need to go to y=9, I need to go up, so U actions will be needed. But I have to avoid the cars on rows 1 to 8.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, D decreases, S same.\n\nMinimal number of turns: since I need to go from y=1 to y=9, that's 8 steps up, so at least 8 turns if I can go straight up without stopping. But I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 8.\n\nBut let's see if I can do it in 8 turns.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, but let's clarify the indexing.\n\nThe sequence is for t=0 to H-1, where t is offset from t₁.\n\nSet τ = t - t₁, so at τ=0, turn t₁, position (0, y_{t₁}) = (0,1)\n\nThen after actions, at τ=H, position should be (0,9), but since actions are applied, after H actions, at time t₁ + H, y should be 9.\n\nThe position at turn T is after the action? Let's see the update.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at time t, action a_t is taken, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nStandard: at the beginning of turn t, position is y_t, then action a_t is chosen, then y_{t+1} is computed.\n\nBut for collision, it says \"at turn T\", which I think means at time T, when we are at position y_T.\n\nThen for that turn T, we check if on row y_T, at time T, 0 is in car span.\n\nTime T is the turn number.\n\nIn the car update, at time T, span is based on T.\n\nSo at turn T, player is at (0, y_T), and we check cars on row y_T at time T.\n\nIf 0 is in some car's span on that row at that time, collision.\n\nNow, in this case, t₁=5, so time starts from 5.\n\nI need to find actions from t=5 to t=5+H-1, so that at time t=5+H, y=9? Let's see.\n\nSet t relative to t₁.\n\nDefine time from t₁.\n\nAt time t₁ (τ=0), position y=1.\n\nAfter action a_{t₁} (which is a_{τ=0}), we get y_{t₁+1} = y_{t₁} + Δy_{a_{t₁}}\n\nSimilarly, after action at t₁ + k, y_{t₁ + k +1} = y_{t₁ + k} + Δy_{a_{t₁ + k}}\n\nWe want y_{t₁ + H} = 9, I think.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to H-1, actions at times t₁ to t₁ + H -1.\n\nThen after action at t₁ + H -1, we have y_{t₁ + H} = y_{t₁ + (H-1) +1} = y_{t₁ + H}\n\nAnd we want y_{t₁ + H} = 9.\n\nSince y_{t₁} =1, after H actions, y increases by the sum of Δy, which is number of U minus number of D, since S has 0.\n\nEach U is +1, D is -1, S is 0.\n\nNet change must be +8 to go from 1 to 9.\n\nSo number of U minus number of D =8.\n\nAnd total actions H = number of U + number of D + number of S.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to minimize the number of S and D, so ideally no D, and as few S as possible.\n\nBut we may need to S or D to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's look at the car positions over time.\n\nCars are on rows 1 to 8, but not all rows have the same cars.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway k: cars listed.\n\nk from 1 to 8.\n\nFor k=1,2,3,4: each has two cars: (-18,-29,right,6) and (30,19,right,6)\n\nk=5,6,7,8: each has three cars: (-18,-29,right,6), (18,7,right,6), (54,43,right,6)\n\nAnd all with speed 6.\n\nNow, since all are right-moving, and speed 6, at time T, for a car with (h,tail) at t₁=5, position is [τ + 6(T-5), h + 6(T-5)]\n\nFor collision, on row k at time T, we need that for some car on row k, 0 is between τ + 6(T-5) and h + 6(T-5) inclusive? Since span includes both ends, I assume.\n\nThe span is [left, right], so 0 in [left, right] means left <= 0 <= right.\n\nNow, for each row, we need to find when 0 is covered by a car on that row.\n\nThat is, for a given row and time, is there a car such that its left <= 0 <= right at that time.\n\nThen, for the player to be safe at time T on row y_T, we need that on row y_T at time T, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nNow, since the player moves vertically, at each time, we are on one row, and we need to ensure for that time and row, it's safe.\n\nAlso, when moving, if we change row at time T, at time T we are on old row, not new row.\n\nIn the action, when we take a_t, it affects y_{t+1}, so at time t, we are on y_t, we take a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAt time t, position is y_t, and we check cars on row y_t at time t.\n\nThen we choose a_t to go to y_{t+1}.\n\nNow, for the path to be safe, for each time t, when at y_t, the row y_t must be safe at time t, meaning no car covers x=0 on that row at time t.\n\nSince x=0 is fixed, and cars move horizontally.\n\nNow, for each row, we can find the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when some car covers x=0.\n\nThen, the player must not be on that row at those times.\n\nSo let's compute for each row the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, let's find for each car, when it covers x=0.\n\nFor a car with span [τ, h] at t=5, moving right at speed 6.\n\nIt covers x=0 when left <= 0 <= right, i.e., τ + 6(T-5) <= 0 <= h + 6(T-5)\n\nSince it's moving right, left = τ + 6(T-5), right = h + 6(T-5)\n\nSo we need τ + 6(T-5) <= 0 <= h + 6(T-5)\n\nSolve for T.\n\nFirst inequality: τ + 6(T-5) <= 0 => 6(T-5) <= -τ => T-5 <= -τ/6\n\nSimilarly, second: 0 <= h + 6(T-5) => -h <= 6(T-5) => T-5 >= -h/6\n\nSo T-5 >= ceil(-h/6) and T-5 <= floor(-τ/6)? Let's be careful with inequalities.\n\nFrom τ + 6(ΔT) <= 0 and 0 <= h + 6(ΔT), where ΔT = T - 5\n\nSo:\n\nτ + 6 ΔT <= 0  => 6 ΔT <= -τ  => ΔT <= -τ/6\n\n0 <= h + 6 ΔT  => -h <= 6 ΔT  => ΔT >= -h/6\n\nSince ΔT must be integer, T integer.\n\nAlso, since the span includes endpoints, equality is allowed.\n\nSo for each car, the times when it covers 0:\n\nΔT such that ceil(-h/6) <= ΔT <= floor(-τ/6) ? Let's see.\n\nFrom ΔT >= -h/6 and ΔT <= -τ/6\n\nSince -h/6 and -τ/6 may not be integer, we need to take appropriate ceil and floor.\n\nΔT must satisfy: max( ceil( -h/6 ) , something) no.\n\nΔT >= ceil( -h/6 ) ? -h/6, since ΔT >= -h/6, and ΔT integer, so ΔT >= ceil(-h/6)\n\nSimilarly, ΔT <= -τ/6, and ΔT integer, so ΔT <= floor(-τ/6)\n\nYes.\n\nFor example, take a car with h and τ.\n\nΔT min = ceil(-h/6)\n\nΔT max = floor(-τ/6)\n\nThen it covers 0 for ΔT from ceil(-h/6) to floor(-τ/6) inclusive.\n\nNow, let's compute for each car.\n\nFirst, for rows 1-4, cars: car A: h=-18, τ=-29\n\ncar B: h=30, τ=19\n\nFor car A: h=-18, τ=-29\n\nΔT min = ceil( -(-18)/6 ) = ceil(18/6) = ceil(3) =3\n\nΔT max = floor( -(-29)/6 ) = floor(29/6) = floor(4.833) =4\n\nSo covers at ΔT=3 and ΔT=4.\n\nΔT = T-5, so at T=5+3=8 and T=5+4=9.\n\nSimilarly, car B: h=30, τ=19\n\nΔT min = ceil(-30/6) = ceil(-5) = -5\n\nΔT max = floor(-19/6) = floor(-3.166) = -4? Let's compute.\n\n-30/6 = -5, ceil(-5) = -5\n\n-19/6 ≈ -3.166, floor(-3.166) = -4? Floor is the greatest integer less than or equal, so floor(-3.166) = -4? No.\n\n-3.166, less than -3, greater than -4, so floor is -4? No.\n\nFloor(x) is greatest integer <= x.\n\nx = -3.166, integers <= -3.166 are -4, -5, ..., greatest is -4.\n\nBut -4 < -3.166, yes -4 <= -3.166.\n\n-4 = -4.0 < -3.166, yes.\n\nBut -3.166 is greater than -4, less than -3.\n\nSo integers less than or equal to -3.166: -4, -5, etc., greatest is -4.\n\nSimilarly, ceil(-3.166) = -3, since ceil is smallest integer >= x.\n\nFor car B:\n\nΔT min = ceil(-h/6) = ceil(-30/6) = ceil(-5) = -5\n\nΔT max = floor(-τ/6) = floor(-19/6) = floor(-3.166) = -4\n\nSo ΔT from -5 to -4 inclusive.\n\nThat is T-5 = -5 or -4, so T=0 or T=1.\n\nBut T is turn, and we start from t₁=5, so T=0 and T=1 are before current time, so not relevant for future turns. We care about T >=5.\n\nSimilarly, for car A, we have T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow for rows 5-8, three cars.\n\nFirst car: same as above, (-18,-29,right,6), so covers at T=8 and T=9, same as car A for row1.\n\nSecond car: (18,7,right,6) so h=18, τ=7\n\nΔT min = ceil(-h/6) = ceil(-18/6) = ceil(-3) = -3\n\nΔT max = floor(-τ/6) = floor(-7/6) = floor(-1.166) = -2\n\nSo ΔT from -3 to -2, T=2 and 3, before t₁=5, not relevant.\n\nThird car: (54,43,right,6) h=54, τ=43\n\nΔT min = ceil(-54/6) = ceil(-9) = -9\n\nΔT max = floor(-43/6) = floor(-7.166) = -8? -43/6 ≈ -7.166, floor(-7.166) = -8\n\nSince -8 <= -7.166 < -7\n\nSo ΔT from -9 to -8, T= -4 and -3, way before, not relevant.\n\nSo for row 1: unsafe at times when cars cover x=0.\n\nCar A covers at T=8,9\n\nCar B covers at T=0,1, irrelevant.\n\nSo row 1 unsafe only at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly for row 2,3,4: same cars, so unsafe at T=8 and T=9 only.\n\nNow row 5: cars: car A: (-18,-29,right,6) covers T=8,9\n\ncar B: (18,7,right,6) covers T=2,3 irrelevant\n\ncar C: (54,43,right,6) covers T=-4,-3 irrelevant\n\nSo row 5 also unsafe only at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly, row 6,7,8 same as row 5, since all have same cars? From table:\n\nk=5,6,7,8 all have: (-18,-29,right,6), (18,7,right,6), (54,43,right,6)\n\nSo yes, for all rows 1 to 8, the only unsafe times are T=8 and T=9.\n\nBecause the other cars cover only past or future irrelevant times.\n\nSo for every row from 1 to 8, it is unsafe only at turns 8 and 9 (relative to absolute time).\n\nT=8 and T=9.\n\nNow, the player starts at t=5, y=1.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 by some time.\n\nAt times t=8 and t=9, all rows 1-8 are unsafe, meaning if the player is on any row 1-8 at t=8 or t=9, there will be collision because for that row, at that time, x=0 is covered.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, if player is on row 0 or row 9, it might be safe, but row 0 and row 9 have no cars, since cars only on freeways 1-8.\n\nThe grid: vertical axis y=0,1,2,...,9. Cars on freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so always safe.\n\nNow, at t=8 and t=9, rows 1-8 are all unsafe, so player cannot be on rows 1-8 at those times.\n\nTherefore, at turn 8 and turn 9, player must be on y=0 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, and y=0 is the bottom.\n\nNow, current time t=5, y=1.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe unsafe times are only t=8 and t=9, so for other times, all rows are safe, since no other times have cars covering x=0.\n\nFor example, at t=5,6,7,10,etc., for any row, no car covers x=0, so safe to be anywhere.\n\nOnly at t=8 and t=9, must not be on rows 1-8.\n\nNow, we need to plan the actions to go from y=1 at t=5 to y=9 as soon as possible, but avoiding being on rows 1-8 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSince at t=8 and t=9, we must be on y=0 or y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, so perhaps we can be on y=9 by t=8 or earlier.\n\nBut let's see the minimal H.\n\nFirst, from y=1 to y=9, minimum 8 steps up, so if no delays, we can reach in 8 actions: all U, from t=5 to t=12? Let's see the time.\n\nAt time t, after action, y_{t+1}.\n\nSet time line.\n\nAt time t=5: position y=1\n\nWe take action a_5, then y_6 = y_5 + Δy_5\n\nSimilarly, a_6, y_7, and so on.\n\nWe want y_{5+H} =9 for some H.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t=5+H.\n\nNow, the turns from t=5 to t=5+H-1 for actions, position at t=5+H.\n\nNow, unsafe times t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt time t=8 and t=9, player must be on y=0 or y=9.\n\nNow, current t=5, y=1.\n\nIf we go straight up with U actions:\n\nStart t=5, y=1, take a_5=U, then y_6=2\n\nt=6, y=2, take a_6=U, y_7=3\n\nt=7, y=3, take a_7=U, y_8=4\n\nt=8, y=4, but at t=8, y=4, which is row 4, unsafe! Collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we continue: t=8, y=4, if take U, y_9=5, then at t=9, y=5, unsafe.\n\nSo indeed, at t=8 and t=9, we are on rows 4 and 5, unsafe.\n\nWe need to avoid that.\n\nWe must be on y=0 or y=9 at t=8 and t=9.\n\ny=9 is the target, so if we can reach y=9 before t=8, then at t=8 and t=9, we are on y=9, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=0, but y=0 is bottom, and we need to go to y=9, so going down might take more time.\n\nSo better to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nCan we reach y=9 before t=8?\n\nt=5, y=1\n\nAfter one U: t=6, y=2\n\nAfter two U: t=7, y=3\n\nAfter three U: t=8, y=4\n\nAfter four U: t=9, y=5\n\n...\n\nTo reach y=9, we need 8 U actions.\n\nFrom y=1 to y=9, need +8, so 8 U actions.\n\nEach action takes one turn.\n\nSo actions at t=5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12? Let's list:\n\nTime: action at time t affects y_{t+1}\n\nAt t=5, action a_5, y_6 = y_5 + Δy_5\n\ny_5 =1\n\nIf a_5=U, y_6=2\n\na_6=U, y_7=3\n\na_7=U, y_8=4\n\na_8=U, y_9=5\n\na_9=U, y_10=6\n\na_10=U, y_11=7\n\na_11=U, y_12=8\n\na_12=U, y_13=9\n\nSo at time t=13, y=9.\n\nBut we need to be safe at each step.\n\nAt t=8, y=4, which is row 4, unsafe.\n\nAt t=9, y=5, row 5, unsafe.\n\nWe need to not be on rows 1-8 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nIn this path, we are on row 4 at t=8 and row 5 at t=9, both unsafe.\n\nTo reach y=9 earlier, but with 8 U actions, the earliest we can have y=9 is at t=13, as above, if we start U from t=5.\n\ny_5=1\n\nAfter first U at t=5, y_6=2\n\nAfter second U at t=6, y_7=3\n\nAfter third U at t=7, y_8=4\n\nAfter fourth U at t=8, y_9=5\n\n...\n\nAfter k U actions, y_{5+k} = 1 + k\n\nSet y_{5+k} = 1 + number of U up to k actions.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{5+H} = 1 + (number of U) - (number of D)\n\nSince start y=1, end y=9, net +8, so number of U minus number of D =8.\n\nThe time to reach y=9 is minimized when we have no D and no S, all U, but then y_{5+H} =1+H, set to 9, so 1+H=9, H=8, then y_{13}=9, but at intermediate times, we are on low rows.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, we are on y=4 and y=5, unsafe.\n\nSo we need to adjust the path so that at t=8 and t=9, we are not on rows 1-8.\n\nOptions:\n\n1. Be on y=9 at t=8 or earlier.\n\nBut to be on y=9, we need at least 8 U actions from y=1.\n\nEarliest time to be on y=9: if we do 8 U actions starting from t=5.\n\nAction at t=5: U, y_6=2\n\nt=6: U, y_7=3\n\nt=7: U, y_8=4\n\nt=8: U, y_9=5\n\nt=9: U, y_10=6\n\n...\n\nt=12: U, y_13=9\n\nSo at time t=13, y=9.\n\nAt t=8, y=4; t=9, y=5; both unsafe.\n\nWe cannot be on y=9 before t=13 with all U.\n\nIf we use some S or D, it would take more actions, so y=9 later, worse.\n\nSo we cannot reach y=9 by t=8 or t=9.\n\nTherefore, at t=8 and t=9, we must be on y=0, since we cannot be on y=9 yet.\n\ny=0 is safe at those times.\n\nSo, we need to be at y=0 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nThen after that, go to y=9.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, we must be on y=0 or y=9, but y=9 not possible, so y=0.\n\nNow, from y=1 at t=5 to y=0 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nt=8 and t=9 are two times, so we need to be at y=0 at both times? Not necessarily, but since we are at a position at each turn, we need to be safe at each turn.\n\nSpecifically, at turn t=8, we must be on y=0 or y=9.\n\nAt turn t=9, we must be on y=0 or y=9.\n\nSince y=9 not reachable, we must be on y=0 at t=8 and at t=9.\n\nThen, after t=9, we can go up to y=9.\n\nNow, from t=5, y=1, to y=0 at t=8.\n\nt=8 is time, we need position at time t=8 to be y=0.\n\nSimilarly, at time t=9, y=0.\n\nNow, let's see the path.\n\nFirst, from t=5 to t=8.\n\nAt t=5, y=1.\n\nWe need to be at y=0 at t=8.\n\nt=8 is 3 turns later? Time from t=5 to t=8 is 3 steps: actions at t=5,6,7 affect positions at t=6,7,8.\n\nAt time t=5: position y=1\n\nAfter action a_5, y_6 set.\n\nAt time t=6: position y_6\n\nAction a_6, y_7 set.\n\nAt time t=7: position y_7\n\nAction a_7, y_8 set.\n\nAt time t=8: position y_8\n\nWe need y_8 = 0.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, we need y_9=0.\n\nBut y_9 depends on action at t=8.\n\nNow, to have y_8=0.\n\ny_8 depends on actions from t=5 to t=7.\n\ny_5=1\n\ny_6 = y_5 + Δy_5\n\ny_7 = y_6 + Δy_6\n\ny_8 = y_7 + Δy_7\n\nWe need y_8 = 0.\n\nSince y=1 at start, to reach y=0, we need net down or something.\n\ny_8 = y_5 + sum_{i=5 to7} Δy_i\n\ny_5=1\n\ny_8 = 1 + Δy_5 + Δy_6 + Δy_7\n\nSet y_8=0, so 1 + Δy_5 + Δy_6 + Δy_7 =0, so Δy_5 + Δy_6 + Δy_7 = -1\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,or +1.\n\nSo possible, for example, two S and one D, or one D and two S, etc., but need to be at y=0 at t=8.\n\nAlso, during the path, we need to be safe at each time.\n\nBut for t=5,6,7, all rows are safe, since unsafe only at t=8,9.\n\nAt t=5,6,7, for any row, no car covers x=0, so safe to be anywhere.\n\nSo no issue for t<8.\n\nSimilarly, after t=9, safe.\n\nNow, we need y_8=0 and y_9=0.\n\ny_9 depends on action at t=8.\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy_8\n\nIf y_8=0, and we need y_9=0, so we must take Δy_8=0, i.e., S at t=8.\n\nThen y_9=0.\n\nAfter that, we can go up to y=9.\n\nNow, from t=5 to t=7, we need to get to y_8=0.\n\ny_5=1\n\nActions at t=5,6,7 to set y_8.\n\ny_8 = 1 + Δy_5 + Δy_6 + Δy_7 =0\n\nSo Δy_5 + Δy_6 + Δy_7 = -1\n\nPossible ways: one D and two S, or one D, one U, one D? But net -1.\n\nSince each Δy is integer, net -1.\n\nFor example:\n\n- One D and two S: e.g., D,S,S or S,D,S or S,S,D\n\n- Or three actions with net -1, like D,U,D but net -1? D is -1, U is +1, so D and U cancel, plus another D, net -1, but with three actions.\n\nBut we have three actions: t=5,6,7.\n\ny_8 =1 + Δy5 + Δy6 + Δy7\n\nSet to 0.\n\nSo sum Δy = -1.\n\nNow, minimal actions to reach y=0 from y=1.\n\nWe can go directly: at t=5, take D, then y_6 = y5 + (-1) =1-1=0\n\nThen at t=6, y=0, take S, y_7=0? Let's see.\n\nIf at t=5, a_5=D, then y_6 = y5 + Δy5 =1 + (-1) =0\n\nThen at time t=6, position y=0.\n\nThen action a_6, say S, then y_7 = y6 +0 =0\n\nThen action a_7, S, y_8=0\n\nThen at t=8, y=0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, take action a_8, to set y_9.\n\nWe need y_9=0, so take S, then y_9=0.\n\nAt t=9, y=0, safe.\n\nThen after that, go to y=9.\n\nNow, from t=9, y=0, we need to go to y=9.\n\nWith all U, it takes 9 actions? y_9=0\n\nAfter a_9=U, y_10=1\n\na_10=U, y_11=2\n\n...\n\nup to y_18=9? y_10=1, y_11=2, ..., y_17=8, y_18=9.\n\nSo at time t=18, y=9.\n\nBut H actions from t=5 to t=5+H-1, y_{5+H}=9.\n\nHere y_{18}=9, so 5+H=18, H=13.\n\nBut we can start going up earlier.\n\nIn the above, at t=7, y_7 could be different.\n\nWe need to minimize H.\n\nSince we have to be at y=0 at t=8 and t=9, we lose time there.\n\nAfter t=9, we can go directly up.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach y=9 faster by not staying at y=0 longer.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, we must be at y=0 or y=9, and y=9 not possible, so y=0 is necessary.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=0 only at t=8 and t=9, but go up before or after.\n\nBut before t=8, from t=5 to t=7, we can move, but we need to end at y=0 at t=8.\n\nAfter t=9, we go up.\n\nThe critical point is to have y=0 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nNow, to minimize time to y=9, we should start going up as soon as possible after t=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=0.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9.\n\nWith all U, actions at t=9 to t=16: a_9=U, y_10=1; a_10=U, y_11=2; ... a_16=U, y_17=8; y_17=8 at time t=17? Let's list times.\n\nAt time t=9: position y=0\n\nTake a_9=U, then y_10=1\n\nt=10: y=1, take a_10=U, y_11=2\n\nt=11: y=2, take a_11=U, y_12=3\n\nt=12: y=3, take a_12=U, y_13=4\n\nt=13: y=4, take a_13=U, y_14=5\n\nt=14: y=5, take a_14=U, y_15=6\n\nt=15: y=6, take a_15=U, y_16=7\n\nt=16: y=7, take a_16=U, y_17=8\n\nt=17: y=8, take a_17=U, y_18=9\n\nSo y_18=9, at time t=18.\n\nH: actions from t=5 to t=5+H-1, y_{5+H}=9.\n\nHere y_18=9, so 5+H=18, H=13.\n\nBut we have actions from t=5 to t=17, that's 13 actions? t=5 to t=17 inclusive is 13 actions? Let's count.\n\nAction times: t=5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17\n\nThat's 13 actions: from t=5 to t=17, 17-5+1=13 actions.\n\ny_{5+13}=y_{18}=9, yes.\n\nBut earlier, we were at y=0 from t=6 to t=9? In the path above, with a_5=D, y_6=0; then a_6=S, y_7=0; a_7=S, y_8=0; then a_8=S, y_9=0; then start U from t=9.\n\nBut at t=6,7,8,9 we are at y=0, which is fine, but we can reduce the time at y=0.\n\nSpecifically, we don't need to be at y=0 before t=8, except to reach it.\n\nAt t=5, we can be at higher y, as long as by t=8 we are at y=0.\n\nFor example, at t=5, y=1, we could go up a bit, but then come down to y=0 at t=8.\n\nBut going up and then down might take more actions, so it would delay reaching y=9.\n\nSince from y=1 to y=0 directly is faster.\n\nIn the above, with a_5=D, we reach y=0 at t=6, then stay until t=9.\n\nBut we only need to be at y=0 at t=8 and t=9, so at t=6 and t=7, we could be elsewhere, but since we need to set y_8=0, and y_8 depends on previous.\n\ny_8 = y_7 + Δy_7\n\nTo have y_8=0, we can have y_7 arbitrary, then take appropriate action.\n\nBut with net, from t=5 to t=7, we need to reach a point so that with action at t=7, we set y_8=0.\n\nBut to minimize actions, probably best to go directly to y=0.\n\nSince at t=5,6,7, all positions are safe, we can, for example, stay at y=1 or go up, but then we need to come down, which might require D actions, increasing H.\n\nFor instance, suppose at t=5, we take S, y_6=1\n\nThen at t=6, take S, y_7=1\n\nThen at t=7, take D, y_8=1 + (-1) =0\n\nThen y_8=0.\n\nThen at t=8, take S, y_9=0\n\nThen from t=9, go up to y=9.\n\nNow, with this, actions: t=5: S, y_6=1\n\nt=6: S, y_7=1\n\nt=7: D, y_8=0\n\nt=8: S, y_9=0\n\nThen t=9: U, y_10=1\n\nt=10: U, y_11=2\n\n...\n\nup to t=16: U, y_17=8\n\nt=17: U, y_18=9\n\nSame as before, y_18=9.\n\nCompared to previous: if we took D at t=5, we had y_6=0, then S at t=6 and t=7, y_7=0, y_8=0, same.\n\nIn both cases, we reach y=0 at t=6 or later, but to y=9 at t=18.\n\nBut in the first case with D at t=5, y_6=0, then we stayed at y=0 from t=6 to t=9.\n\nWith S at t=5 and t=6, we stayed at y=1 until t=7, then D to y=0.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we start from y=0 at t=9, same.\n\nNow, can we reach y=9 faster?\n\nFor example, after t=9, we go up, but we have to go from y=0 to y=9, 9 steps, so minimum 9 actions after t=9, but t=9 action is for y_10, etc.\n\nSince we need to be at y=0 only at t=8 and t=9, at other times we can be moving up.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, we must be at y=0.\n\nNow, from t=5 to t=7, we can be going up, as long as at t=8 we are at y=0.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to some point, then down to y=0 at t=8.\n\nBut going up and down adds extra actions.\n\nFor instance, start at t=5, y=1, take U, y_6=2\n\nThen at t=6, take U, y_7=3\n\nThen at t=7, we need to set y_8=0, so take D, then y_8 = y_7 + (-1) =3-1=2, not 0.\n\ny_8 = y_7 + Δy_7\n\nIf y_7=3, to have y_8=0, we need Δy_7 = -3, but Δy can only be -1,0,1, so impossible to go from y=3 to y=0 in one step.\n\nSimilarly, from any y>0, we need at least y steps down to reach 0.\n\nBut with only one action, we can only change by 1.\n\nSo to have y_8=0, we must have y_7=1 or 0 or something, and take D or S.\n\nSpecifically, y_8 = y_7 + Δy_7\n\nSet y_8=0, so if y_7 = k, then Δy_7 must be -k, so only possible if k=1 and Δy_7=-1, or k=0 and Δy_7=0, or k=-1 but y cannot be negative, y>=0.\n\ny from 0 to 9, so y_7 can be 0 or 1.\n\nIf y_7=0, then Δy_7=0 to have y_8=0\n\nIf y_7=1, then Δy_7=-1 to have y_8=0\n\nSimilarly, for y_9=0, but y_9 depends on y_8 and action at t=8.\n\nNow, back to the point.\n\nTo have y_8=0, we need y_7 to be 0 or 1.\n\nCase 1: y_7=0, then a_7=S, y_8=0\n\nCase 2: y_7=1, then a_7=D, y_8=0\n\nNow, similarly, we need to reach y_7=0 or 1 from y_5=1.\n\ny_7 = y_5 + Δy_5 + Δy_6 = 1 + Δy_5 + Δy_6\n\nSet y_7 to 0 or 1.\n\nIf y_7=0, then 1 + Δy_5 + Δy_6 =0, so Δy_5 + Δy_6 = -1\n\nIf y_7=1, then 1 + Δy_5 + Δy_6 =1, so Δy_5 + Δy_6 =0\n\nNow, for minimal H, we want to minimize the time spent before going up.\n\nAlso, after t=9, we go up.\n\nFirst, let's assume we go directly to the point.\n\nTo have y_7=0 or 1 with few actions.\n\nSince we have two actions t=5 and t=6.\n\nIf we want y_7=0, need net -1 from t=5 to t=6, e.g., D and S or S and D, or two D but net -2, too much.\n\nΔy_5 + Δy_6 = -1\n\nPossible: (D,S) or (S,D) or (D,D) but (D,D) sum -2, y_7=1-2=-1 invalid.\n\nSo only (D,S) or (S,D) or (U,D) but U and D: if U then D, Δy= +1 then -1, net 0, y_7=1+0=1\n\nSimilarly, D and U net 0.\n\nOr S and S net 0.\n\nSo for y_7=0: need Δy5 + Δy6 = -1, so possibilities: (D,S): Δy5=-1, Δy6=0, y_6 = y5 + Δy5 =1-1=0, then y_7= y6 +0=0\n\nOr (S,D): Δy5=0, y_6=1+0=1, Δy6=-1, y_7=1-1=0\n\nOr (D,D) invalid.\n\nAlso (U,D): Δy5=+1, y_6=1+1=2, Δy6=-1, y_7=2-1=1, not 0.\n\nOnly (D,S) or (S,D) give y_7=0.\n\nIf we want y_7=1, then Δy5 + Δy6 =0, so (S,S), or (U,D), or (D,U), etc.\n\nBut for y_8=0, if y_7=0, then a_7=S, y_8=0\n\nIf y_7=1, then a_7=D, y_8=0\n\nNow, similarly for y_9.\n\nFirst, let's take the case where we have y_7=0.\n\nFor example, with (D,S) at t=5 and t=6.\n\nt=5: D, y_6=1-1=0\n\nt=6: S, y_7=0+0=0\n\nThen at t=7, to have y_8=0, since y_7=0, take a_7=S, y_8=0\n\nThen at t=8, y=0, take a_8, to have y_9=0, take S, y_9=0\n\nThen at t=9, y=0, start going up.\n\nActions: t=5: D, y_6=0\n\nt=6: S, y_7=0\n\nt=7: S, y_8=0\n\nt=8: S, y_9=0\n\nt=9: U, y_10=1\n\nt=10: U, y_11=2\n\n...\n\nt=16: U, y_17=8\n\nt=17: U, y_18=9\n\ny_18=9.\n\nWith (S,D): t=5: S, y_6=1\n\nt=6: D, y_7=1-1=0\n\nt=7: S, y_8=0\n\nt=8: S, y_9=0\n\nSame as above.\n\nIf we have y_7=1, then we need a_7=D to set y_8=0.\n\nFor example, to have y_7=1, we can do (S,S) at t=5 and t=6: t=5: S, y_6=1; t=6: S, y_7=1\n\nThen t=7: D, y_8=1-1=0\n\nThen t=8: S, y_9=0\n\nThen same as before.\n\nOr (U,D): t=5: U, y_6=1+1=2; t=6: D, y_7=2-1=1; then t=7: D, y_8=1-1=0? y_7=1, a_7=D, y_8=0.\n\nBut we have extra action U and D, which cancel, so same net, but we went to y=2 and back, which doesn't help, and we have to take more actions later to go up.\n\nIn all cases, we end up with y_9=0 at t=9, then 9 U actions to y_18=9.\n\nH=13 actions.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach y=9 with fewer total actions by not staying at y=0 for multiple turns.\n\nFor example, at t=9, we are at y=0, but we need to be at y=9.\n\nSince after t=9, all times are safe, we can go up directly.\n\nBut we have to spend turns at t=8 and t=9 at y=0.\n\nAnother idea: can we reach y=9 before t=8? Impossible, as we saw.\n\nOr after t=9, but we have to be at y=0 at t=9, so we start from y=0 at t=9.\n\nUnless we can be at y=9 at t=8 or t=9, but we can't.\n\nPerhaps at t=8, we are at y=0, and at t=9, we start going up, but we need y_9=0, so at t=9 we must be at y=0, so we can't start going up until t=9 action.\n\nIn the action at t=9, we can take U, but y_10=1, so at t=9 position is still y_9=0.\n\nThen we go up.\n\nSo no way around.\n\nThus, minimal H is 13, with y=9 at t=18.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nActions:\n\nt=5: D (to go down to y=0)\n\nBut at t=5, position y=1, take D, then y_6=0\n\nThen to stay, at t=6: S, y_7=0\n\nt=7: S, y_8=0\n\nt=8: S, y_9=0\n\nt=9: U, y_10=1\n\nt=10: U, y_11=2\n\nt=11: U, y_12=3\n\nt=12: U, y_13=4\n\nt=13: U, y_14=5\n\nt=14: U, y_15=6\n\nt=15: U, y_16=7\n\nt=16: U, y_17=8\n\nt=17: U, y_18=9\n\nNow, y_18=9, so after 13 actions, from t=5 to t=17.\n\nH=13.\n\nBut we can reduce the time at y=0.\n\nFor example, at t=5, instead of going down immediately, we can go up, but then we need to come down.\n\nSuppose at t=5, take U, y_6=2\n\nThen at t=6, take U, y_7=3\n\nThen at t=7, we need to set y_8=0.\n\nBut y_7=3, to have y_8=0, need Δy_7 = -3, impossible.\n\ny_7 must be 0 or 1 to reach y_8=0 in one step.\n\nSo if we go up to y=2 at t=6, then at t=6 we need to start coming down.\n\nAt t=6, y=2, take D, y_7=1\n\nThen at t=7, take D, y_8=0\n\nThen y_8=0\n\nThen at t=8, S, y_9=0\n\nThen same as before, but we used U at t=5 and D at t=6 and D at t=7, so net: U then D D, net one D, so from y=1 to y=0, but with extra U and D that cancel.\n\nActions: t=5: U, y_6=2\n\nt=6: D, y_7=1\n\nt=7: D, y_8=0\n\nt=8: S, y_9=0\n\nThen t=9: U, y_10=1\n\netc., same as before, but we have one more action: at t=5 U and t=6 D, which is unnecessary, so we have 14 actions to reach y_18=9? Let's see.\n\nt=5: U, y_6=2\n\nt=6: D, y_7=1\n\nt=7: D, y_8=0\n\nt=8: S, y_9=0\n\nt=9: U, y_10=1\n\nt=10: U, y_11=2\n\n...\n\nt=17: U, y_18=9? y_10=1, y_11=2, ..., y_17=8, then t=17: U, y_18=9, same as before.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=5 to t=17, 13 actions still? t=5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17: 13 actions.\n\ny_18=9.\n\nIn the first sequence with D at t=5, we had actions t=5 D, t=6 S, t=7 S, t=8 S, t=9 U, ..., t=17 U.\n\nIn this sequence: t=5 U, t=6 D, t=7 D, t=8 S, t=9 U, ..., t=17 U.\n\nSo from t=9 to t=17 is 9 actions to go from y=0 to y=9? t=9 U to t=17 U: 9 actions, y from 0 to 9? t=9 action U, y_10=1, t=10 U, y_11=2, ..., t=17 U, y_18=9, so 9 actions from t=9 to t=17 for 8 steps? y_10=1 to y_18=9, that's 8 steps in 8 actions? From time t=10 to t=18, but positions.\n\nAfter action at t=9, y_10=1\n\nAfter action at t=10, y_11=2\n\n...\n\nAfter action at t=16, y_17=8\n\nAfter action at t=17, y_18=9\n\nSo actions t=9 to t=17: 9 actions for 9 steps from y_10=1 to y_18=9? y_10=1, y_11=2, ..., y_18=9, that's 9 positions from y_10 to y_18, but y increases by 1 each step, from 1 to 9, 8 increments, but 9 positions: y_10=1, y_11=2, ..., y_18=9, that's 9 points, 8 intervals.\n\nBut actions: 9 actions from t=9 to t=17.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence, total actions from t=5 to t=17: 13 actions.\n\nNow, back to minimizing H.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier by not going all the way down.\n\nBut we must be at y=0 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=10, we can start from y=1, but since we are at y=0 at t=9, after action U at t=9, y_10=1, then we go up.\n\nNo better.\n\nAnother thought: can we be at y=9 at t=9? But to be at y=9, we need to have y_9=9.\n\nBut y_9 depends on previous.\n\ny_5=1, after 4 actions, y_9 =1 + sum Δy from t=5 to t=8 actions? Actions at t=5,6,7,8 affect y_6 to y_9.\n\ny_6 = y5 + Δy5\n\ny_7 = y6 + Δy6\n\ny_8 = y7 + Δy7\n\ny_9 = y8 + Δy8\n\nTo have y_9=9, from y_5=1, need net +8 in 4 actions.\n\nEach action max +1, so possible only if all U: a5=U, y6=2; a6=U, y7=3; a7=U, y8=4; a8=U, y9=5 <9, not enough.\n\nWith 4 actions, max y9=5, since y5=1, each U increases by 1, so after 4 U, y9=5.\n\nCannot reach 9 in 4 actions.\n\nSimilarly, by t=8, y8 <= y5 +3 =4, since 3 actions from t=5 to t=7.\n\ny8 = y5 + Δy5 + Δy6 + Δy7 <=1+3=4 if all U.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=9 before t=13 at earliest, as before.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 13, with the sequence including going to y=0 at t=6 and staying until t=9, then going up.\n\nBut in the sequence, we can have different actions as long as we are at y=0 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nFor the answer, we need to output the actions from t=5 onwards.\n\nBut let's specify the sequence.\n\nTo make it simple, let's choose one.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt t=5: D (to go down to y=0 at t=6)\n\nThen at t=6: S (stay at y=0)\n\nt=7: S (stay)\n\nt=8: S (stay, to have y=0 at t=9)\n\nAt t=8, action S, so y9=0.\n\nThen from t=9 to t=17: all U.\n\nBut t=17 action for y18=9.\n\nNow, number of U actions: from t=9 to t=17, 9 U actions, but we need to go from y=0 to y=9, 9 steps, so 9 U actions are needed, no S or D.\n\nIn the sequence, actions:\n\nt=5: D\n\nt=6: S\n\nt=7: S\n\nt=8: S\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U\n\nt=11: U\n\nt=12: U\n\nt=13: U\n\nt=14: U\n\nt=15: U\n\nt=16: U\n\nt=17: U\n\nThat's 13 actions, from t=5 to t=17.\n\ny at t=18 is 9.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be for turns starting from t_1=5.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nThen at turn 17, after action, y_18=9.\n\nH=13.\n\nBut is there a way with less than 13?\n\nSuppose we can be at y=0 only at exactly t=8 and t=9, and not before.\n\nFor example, at t=5, take S, y6=1\n\nt=6, take S, y7=1\n\nt=7, take D, y8=0\n\nThen at t=8, take S, y9=0\n\nThen t=9, U, y10=1\n\netc.\n\nSame as before, y18=9 with 13 actions.\n\nAt t=5, take nothing, but we have to take action.\n\nAnother idea: after t=9, since all safe, we can go up faster? No, only one step per turn.\n\nPerhaps we can reach a higher position before t=8, but we have to come down to y=0 at t=8, which costs extra actions.\n\nFor example, if we go to y=3 at some point, then need three down actions to y=0, which adds two extra actions compared to going directly to y=0.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo minimal H is 13.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe times.\n\nEarlier I concluded that only t=8 and t=9 are unsafe for rows 1-8.\n\nBut let me double-check the car positions.\n\nFor example, on row 1, car A: at T=8, ΔT=3, left = τ + 6(3) = -29 + 18 = -11, right = h + 18 = -18+18=0? h=-18, right = h + 6(ΔT) = -18 + 6*3 = -18+18=0\n\nAt T=8, ΔT=3, right = h + 6(3) = -18 + 18 =0\n\nLeft = τ + 18 = -29 +18 = -11\n\nSo span [-11, 0] at T=8, so 0 is included, since right=0.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, ΔT=4, left = -29 + 24 = -5, right = -18 + 24 =6, so [ -5,6], 0 included.\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nAnd other times, not covered.\n\nFor rows 5-8, same, only the first car covers t=8,9.\n\nNow, about the note: when moving, if you move to different row at turn T, you are not on new row at turn T.\n\nBut in this case, since we are only concerned about position at time T, and we are on y_T at time T, regardless of action.\n\nIn the action, when we take a_t, it determines y_{t+1}, but at time t, we are on y_t.\n\nSo for collision at time t, it's based on y_t.\n\nIn this path, at t=8, y=0, safe; t=9, y=0, safe; other times, no issue.\n\nSo the sequence should work.\n\nBut can we start going up earlier? For example, at t=8, we are at y=0, take U, but then y9 = y8 + Δy8 =0 +1=1, but we need y9=0 for safety at t=9, since if y9=1, at t=9 on row 1, unsafe.\n\nSo we must have y9=0.\n\nTherefore, at t=8, we must take S (if y8=0) to have y9=0.\n\nCannot take U at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, only after t=9 can we move up.\n\nThus, minimal H is 13.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which is y=9.\n\nNow, in the sequence, with 13 actions, we reach at time t=18.\n\nPerhaps we can have fewer actions by not using S, but we need to stay at y=0.\n\nIn the going up phase, we have no S or D, all U, so efficient.\n\nSo I think H=13 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach y=9 at an earlier time by different path.\n\nSuppose we go up to y=9 directly but avoid t=8 and t=9 on rows 1-8 by being elsewhere, but we have to be on y=0 or 9.\n\nSince we can't be on 9, must be on 0.\n\nNo choice.\n\nPerhaps at t=7, we can be at y=1, then at t=7 take D to y8=0, then at t=8 take S to y9=0, then go up.\n\nBut from t=5 to t=7, if we stay at y=1, with S,S, then t=7 D.\n\nBut same as before.\n\nIf we go up a bit, say t=5 U to y6=2, then t=6 must come down, say D to y7=1, then t=7 D to y8=0, etc., same.\n\nSo no savings.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of turns H is 13.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have D at t=5, but we could have other sequences.\n\nFor example, to make it with fewer S, but not necessary.\n\nSince at t=5,6,7, we can be at y=1, then at t=7 D to y8=0.\n\nBut let's write the sequence clearly.\n\nOne possible sequence:\n\nTurn 5: S  (y6=1)\n\nTurn 6: S  (y7=1)\n\nTurn 7: D  (y8=0)\n\nTurn 8: S  (y9=0)\n\nTurn 9: U  (y10=1)\n\nTurn 10: U  (y11=2)\n\nTurn 11: U  (y12=3)\n\nTurn 12: U  (y13=4)\n\nTurn 13: U  (y14=5)\n\nTurn 14: U  (y15=6)\n\nTurn 15: U  (y16=7)\n\nTurn 16: U  (y17=8)\n\nTurn 17: U  (y18=9)\n\nH=13 actions.\n\nAfter action at turn 17, y18=9.\n\nIn the sequence, turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1=5, so turns: 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17\n\nYes.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed.\n\nBut in this, at turn 5: S, which is fine.\n\nTo avoid going down early, but same.\n\nNow, for the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the car state again.\n\nIn the car state, for rows 1-4, two cars, but we used only the first one for unsafe times.\n\nSimilarly for 5-8.\n\nAnd all unsafe only at t=8,9.\n\nt=8 and t=9 relative to absolute time.\n\nIn the player position, at t=8, if on row 1-8, collision.\n\nIn our sequence, at t=8, y=0, safe; t=9, y=0, safe.\n\nOther times, no issue.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=13.\n\nThe sequence as above.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 5: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the sequence, turn 7: D, to go from y=1 to y=0 at t=8.\n\nIn the list, actions at turn t.\n\nIn the going up, from turn 9 to 17, all U, 9 actions, to go from y=0 to y=9, starting from y_10=1 to y_18=9.\n\ny_10=1 after turn 9 action, etc.\n\nI think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 13. This is achieved by staying at \\(y = 1\\) for turns 5 and 6, moving down to \\(y = 0\\) at turn 7, staying at \\(y = 0\\) for turns 8 and 9 to avoid the unsafe times \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\) (where all rows \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are unsafe due to car coverage at \\(x = 0\\)), and then moving up directly to \\(y = 9\\) from turn 9 to turn 17.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 5, staying (S) keeps the player at \\(y = 1\\), which is safe since no cars cover \\(x = 0\\) at \\(t = 5\\).\n- At turn 6, staying (S) keeps the player at \\(y = 1\\), safe for \\(t = 6\\).\n- At turn 7, moving down (D) sets \\(y_8 = 0\\) for \\(t = 8\\).\n- At turn 8, staying (S) keeps \\(y_9 = 0\\) for \\(t = 9\\), avoiding collision since \\(y = 0\\) has no cars.\n- From turn 9 to turn 17, moving up (U) each turn reaches \\(y = 9\\) at \\(t = 18\\).\n\nThis sequence ensures that at the unsafe times \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\), the player is at \\(y = 0\\), which is safe.

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,1) at turn 6 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe collision rule is that at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn, then collision occurs. Importantly, when you move to a new freeway, you're not on it until the next turn, so you only check the freeway you're currently on.\n\nThe car spans move left or right based on their direction and speed. All cars here are moving right, since direction is \"right\" for all. So for a right-moving car, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)], given that at t1, span is [τ, h]. But looking at the data, for example, on freeway 1: (-12, -23, right, 6). I think this means head h = -12, tail τ = -23? But for right-moving, it says span is [τ, h], so if τ is tail and h is head, and it's moving right, so at t1, span is [τ, h] with τ < h since it's from tail to head.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the data, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For example, first car: head = -12, tail = -23. If head is at -12 and tail at -23, that would mean the car is from x=-23 to x=-12, so length 11, and since it's right-moving, head should be the front, so as it moves right, head increases.\n\nBut -23 to -12, with head at -12? That seems odd because if it's moving right, head should be larger, but -12 > -23, so head at -12, tail at -23, so the span is from tail to head, [τ, h] = [-23, -12], so at t1, it covers x from -23 to -12.\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-23 + 6*(T-6), -12 + 6*(T-6)]\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T, and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nPlayer starts at y=1 at turn t1=6.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H, so I should try to go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the cars on each freeway when I'm on it.\n\nSince I start at y=1, and need to go to y=9, that's 8 steps up, so minimum H should be 8 if I can go up every turn without collision. But I need to check if that's possible given the cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all the freeways and their cars at turn T.\n\nt1=6 is the starting turn.\n\nFor any turn T, the car positions depend on T - 6.\n\nLet dt = T - 6, so at turn T = 6 + dt, the car spans are offset by s * dt.\n\nSpeed s is given, all cars have speed 6, from the data.\n\nAll cars have speed 6, and direction right.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to know when 0 is covered by a car on that freeway.\n\nCollision if player is on freeway k at turn T, and 0 is in some car's span on freeway k at turn T.\n\nSo for each freeway k, and for each turn T, I can find if there is a car on k that covers x=0 at T.\n\nBut since the player moves vertically, and cars move horizontally, the freeway is fixed for the car; each car is on a specific freeway.\n\nIn the table, freeway k has cars, and k is the y-level, I assume.\n\nFreeway k means y=k, I think.\n\nSo for each y-level from 1 to 8, I need to know the times when x=0 is occupied by a car on that level.\n\nThen, when the player is at that y at time T, it must not be one of those times.\n\nPlayer position y_t changes with actions.\n\nStart at t=6, y=1.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, say t=6+H, so y_{6+H} =9.\n\nSince we move step by step, to reach y=9 from y=1, we need at least 8 up moves. If we never go down or stay, H=8.\n\nBut we might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions, which would increase H.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway y=1 to 8, the set of turns T where a car covers x=0.\n\nSince cars move at speed 6, and spans are given at t=6.\n\nFor a car with span at t=6: [τ, h] for right-moving, so at time T, span [τ + 6*(T-6), h + 6*(T-6)]\n\n0 is covered if τ + 6*(T-6) <= 0 <= h + 6*(T-6)\n\nSince for right-moving, τ is left end, h is right end, so τ <= h, and span is [τ, h].\n\n0 in span iff τ + 6dt <= 0 <= h + 6dt, where dt = T - 6.\n\nSince T is integer, dt is integer >=0.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right-moving here.\n\nSo condition: τ + 6dt <= 0 <= h + 6dt\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n- h - 6dt <= 0 <= τ + 6dt? Let's solve inequalities.\n\nFrom τ + 6dt <= 0 and 0 <= h + 6dt\n\nSo τ + 6dt <= 0 <= h + 6dt\n\nWhich implies:\n\n6dt <= -τ  and 6dt >= -h\n\nSince τ and h are negative in many cases, let's keep it.\n\nActually, τ + 6dt <= 0 means 6dt <= -τ\n\nAnd 0 <= h + 6dt means 6dt >= -h\n\nSo -h <= 6dt <= -τ\n\nSince τ <= h and both could be negative.\n\nNow dt must be integer, so 6dt must be integer multiple of 6, but dt integer, so 6dt is multiple of 6.\n\nThe values: for each car, find the range of dt where -h <= 6dt <= -τ\n\nThen for that car, 0 is covered when dt satisfies ceil(-h/6) <= dt <= floor(-τ/6)? Let's think.\n\nFrom 6dt >= -h and 6dt <= -τ\n\nSince 6dt is multiple of 6? dt integer, 6dt is multiple of 6, but -h and -τ may not be integer, but in this case, all positions are integers, I assume.\n\nLook at data: all h and τ are integers, like -12, -23, etc.\n\nSo -h and -τ are integers.\n\nSo 6dt >= -h and 6dt <= -τ\n\nSince 6dt is multiple of 6, we need to find dt such that -h <= 6dt <= -τ\n\nNow, because 6dt is multiple of 6, not all dt may satisfy if the inequalities are strict.\n\nBut since 6dt is integer, we can find the integer dt where 6dt >= ceil(-h) and 6dt <= floor(-τ)? No.\n\n-h and -τ are integers, so 6dt must be integer between -h and -τ inclusive? Not necessarily, because -h and -τ may not be multiple of 6.\n\nFor example, suppose -h = 10, -τ = 15, then 6dt >=10 and 6dt <=15, so 6dt can be 12 only if dt=2, since 6*1=6<10, 6*2=12, 6*3=18>15, so only dt=2.\n\nSimilarly, if -h=12, -τ=12, then 6dt=12, dt=2.\n\nIf -h=10, -τ=10, then 6dt=10, but 10 not multiple of 6, no integer dt.\n\nSo in general, for a car, the set of dt where 0 is covered is when 6dt is integer between max( ceil(-h), something), let's think of the bounds.\n\n6dt must satisfy -h <= 6dt <= -τ\n\nSince 6dt integer multiple of 6, let k = 6dt, then k must be integer multiple of 6, and -h <= k <= -τ.\n\nSo the possible k are the multiples of 6 in the interval [ceil(-h), floor(-τ)]? No.\n\nk must be >= -h and <= -τ.\n\nSince k multiple of 6, the smallest k >= -h and largest k <= -τ.\n\nFor example, k_min = ceil(-h / 6) * 6 ? Better to compute numerically.\n\nSimilarly for each car.\n\nThen for each freeway, multiple cars, so the set of dt where at least one car covers 0.\n\nThen for the player, when on that freeway at time T=6+dt, it must be that for that dt, no car covers 0 on that freeway.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: cars: (-12, -23, right, 6) and (36, 25, right, 6)\n\nSecond car: (36, 25, right, 6)? head=36, tail=25? But for right-moving, span should be from tail to head, but tail=25, head=36, so if tail=25 and head=36, that's [25,36], moving right.\n\nBut at t1=6, position given.\n\nSimilarly, first car: head=-12, tail=-23, so span [-23,-12]\n\nNow for first car: τ = -23, h = -12\n\nThen -h = -(-12) = 12\n\n-τ = -(-23) = 23\n\nSo 6dt >= -h = 12 and 6dt <= -τ = 23\n\nSo 12 <= 6dt <= 23\n\n6dt multiple of 6: 12,18,24 but 24>23, so only 12 and 18? 6dt=12 or 18.\n\n12<=18<=23? 18<=23 yes, 24>23 no.\n\n6dt=12,18.\n\n12<=23 yes, 18<=23 yes, 24=24>23 no.\n\nSo dt such that 6dt=12 or 18, so dt=2 or 3.\n\nBecause 6*2=12, 6*3=18.\n\nNow second car on freeway 1: (36,25,right,6), head=36, tail=25, so τ=25, h=36\n\nThen -h = -36, -τ = -25\n\nSo 6dt >= -h = -(-36)? -h = -36? h=36, so -h = -36\n\n-τ = -25\n\nSo 6dt >= -36 and 6dt <= -25\n\nSince -36 is less than -25, so 6dt <= -25 and 6dt >= -36, so -36 <= 6dt <= -25\n\n6dt multiple of 6: possible values, -36,-30,-24, etc.\n\n-36 <= 6dt <= -25\n\n-36: 6dt=-36, dt=-6\n\n-30: 6dt=-30, dt=-5\n\n-24: 6dt=-24, dt=-4\n\nBut dt = T-6, and T >=6 probably, since we start at turn 6, so dt >=0, so 6dt >=0, but -36 <= 6dt <= -25 <0, impossible. So no collision from this car for dt>=0.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, some cars may not cause collision for future turns.\n\nNow for freeway 1, only first car can cause collision, at dt=2 and dt=3, so T=6+2=8 and T=6+3=9.\n\nAt T=8 and T=9, on freeway 1, x=0 is covered.\n\nBut player might not be on freeway 1 at that time.\n\nNow similarly for other freeways.\n\nBut let's list all freeways.\n\nFreeway 1: cars: car A: (-12,-23,right,6), car B: (36,25,right,6)\n\nCar B: as above, no collision for dt>=0.\n\nSo only car A causes collision at dt=2,3 → T=8,9\n\nFreeway 2: same cars as freeway 1: (-12,-23,right,6) and (36,25,right,6)\n\nSimilarly, only first car causes collision at T=8,9\n\nFreeway 3: same, T=8,9\n\nFreeway 4: same, T=8,9\n\nNow freeway 5: cars: (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (60,49,right,6)\n\nFirst car: same as before, causes collision at T=8,9\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,6), head=24, tail=13, so τ=13, h=24\n\n- h = -24\n\n- τ = -13\n\n6dt >= -24 and 6dt <= -13\n\n-24 <= 6dt <= -13\n\n6dt multiple of 6: -24,-18,-12,... but <= -13, so -24,-18? -24 <= -13 yes, -18 <= -13? -18 < -13 yes, but -12 > -13? -12 > -13, so -12 not <= -13.\n\n6dt <= -13, since -13 integer, 6dt <= -13.\n\nPossible 6dt: -24, -18, -12, etc.\n\n-24 <= -13 true\n\n-18 <= -13 true? -18 < -13, so yes.\n\n-12 = -12 > -13, so -12 not <= -13.\n\nSimilarly, -6 > -13, etc.\n\nSo 6dt <= -13 and >= -24.\n\nSo 6dt = -24, -18\n\nBecause -24: dt=-4, -18: dt=-3, both negative, not for future.\n\n6dt >= -24 and <= -13.\n\n-24: 6dt=-24, dt=-4\n\n-18: 6dt=-18, dt=-3\n\n-12: 6dt=-12, dt=-2 > -13? -12 > -13, so 6dt=-12 > -13, not <= -13.\n\nSimilarly, all negative dt, so no collision for dt>=0.\n\nThird car: (60,49,right,6), head=60, tail=49, τ=49, h=60\n\n- h = -60\n\n- τ = -49\n\n6dt >= -60 and 6dt <= -49\n\n-60 <= 6dt <= -49\n\n6dt multiple of 6: -60,-54,-48,... \n\n-60 <= -49 true, -54 <= -49 true, -48 = -48 > -49? -48 > -49, so not <= -49.\n\n-48 > -49, so 6dt <= -49, so -60, -54 are possible? -60 <= -49, -54 <= -49? -54 < -49, yes, -48 = -48 > -49.\n\n-48 > -49, so 6dt <= -49 means 6dt <= -49, so -54, -60, etc.\n\nBut -54: 6dt=-54, dt=-9\n\n-60: dt=-10, all negative, no future collision.\n\nSo for freeway 5, only first car causes collision at T=8,9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: cars (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (60,49,right,6)\n\nSame as freeway 5, so only first car at T=8,9\n\nFreeway 7: same cars, T=8,9\n\nFreeway 8: same, (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (60,49,right,6)\n\nOnly first car at T=8,9\n\nNow for all freeways y=1 to 8, the only dangerous times are T=8 and T=9, where at each freeway, the first car covers x=0.\n\nFor freeways 1-4, there is only one car that can cause collision, at T=8,9.\n\nFor 5-8, also at T=8,9 from the first car.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, for every freeway y=1 to 8, there is a car covering x=0? Not necessarily, but from above, for each y=1 to 8, at T=8 and T=9, the car with (h=-12, τ=-23) covers x=0, since we saw for that car, at dt=2,3 T=8,9.\n\nAnd since all freeways have that car, yes.\n\nSo at T=8 and T=9, for any y from 1 to 8, if the player is on that y, collision occurs because that car covers x=0.\n\nNow, for other times, are there any other dangerous points?\n\nFor example, on freeway 5, the other cars don't cause collision for future, as we saw.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut let's confirm for a freeway, say y=5, at other times.\n\nFor example, at dt=0, T=6, for car on y=5, first car at T=6: span [-23 +0, -12+0] = [-23,-12], 0 not in it.\n\nSecond car: [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nThird: [49,60], not.\n\nAt dt=1, T=7: first car: [-23+6, -12+6] = [-17,-6], 0 not in? -17 to -6, all negative, 0 not covered.\n\n-6 to -17? -17 to -6, -6 is greater, so x from -17 to -6, all x<0, 0 not covered.\n\nSecond car: [13+6,24+6]=[19,30], 0 not covered.\n\nThird: [49+6,60+6]=[55,66], not.\n\nAt dt=2, T=8: first car: [-23+12, -12+12]=[-11,0], so from -11 to 0, so x=0 is covered? Span is [τ + s dt, h + s dt] = [-23 + 12, -12 + 12] = [-11, 0], so yes, 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, at dt=3, T=9: [-23+18, -12+18]=[-5,6], which includes 0.\n\nAt dt=4, T=10: [-23+24, -12+24]=[1,12], 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly, other cars never cover 0.\n\nSo for each freeway y=1 to 8, collision occurs only if player is on that y at T=8 or T=9.\n\nFor other times, no collision on any freeway, since no car covers x=0 except at T=8,9.\n\nIs that true for all?\n\nFor example, on freeway 1, at T=6: cars: [-23,-12] and [25+ something, wait no, at T=6, car B: (36,25) so [25,36], 0 not covered.\n\nAt T=7: car A: [-17,-6], not; car B: [25+6,36+6]=[31,42], not.\n\nT=8: car A: [-11,0], covers 0.\n\nT=9: [-5,6], covers 0.\n\nT=10: [1,12], not.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nAnd for freeways with more cars, like y=5, at T=8, car A covers 0, others don't.\n\nSo indeed, the only dangerous turns are T=8 and T=9 for all freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nAt T=8 and T=9, if player is on any y from 1 to 8, collision occurs.\n\nBut player needs to be on y=9 at the end, and y=9 is the target, which is not a freeway with cars; freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 might be safe, but y=0 is bottom, player can be there.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways with cars, so no cars, so always safe, I assume.\n\nThe problem says: avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8. So y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision possible there.\n\nPlayer starts at y=1 at t=6.\n\nNow, to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: if no obstacles, go up 8 times, from y=1 to y=9 in 8 turns, so at t=14, y=9.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, if player is between y=1 and y=8, collision.\n\nt=8 is turn 8, which is dt=2, T=8.\n\nt=9 is T=9.\n\nNow, player actions: at each turn, choose U, D, or S.\n\nStart at t=6, y=1.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=1 to 8 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nt=8 and t=9 are specific turns.\n\nPlayer moves sequentially.\n\nLet me denote the turn and y position.\n\nt=6: y=1\n\nAfter action at t=6, y changes to t=7, and so on.\n\nAt turn t, player performs action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position is updated after action.\n\nFrom the dynamics:\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nAnd at turn t, player is at (0, y_t).\n\nCollision at turn t if on freeway y_t, and 0 covered by car on that freeway.\n\nFor turn t, we check y_t.\n\nIn this case, at t=8 and t=9, if y_t is between 1 and 8, collision.\n\nNow, we need to reach y_t =9 for some t.\n\nSince we start at y=1, and go to y=9, min H=8, ending at t=14 if all up.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, we need to not be on y=1-8.\n\nt=8 and t=9 are during the journey.\n\nPossible strategies:\n\n- Be at y=0 or y=9 at t=8 and t=9.\n\ny=0 or y=9 have no cars, so safe.\n\n- Or be outside 1-8, but y=0 or 9 are the only options.\n\ny=0 is safe, y=9 is safe.\n\nNow, from start t=6, y=1.\n\nt=6: we are at y=1, but at t=6, is there collision? At t=6, for freeway y=1, cars: first car span [-23,-12], 0 not in, second car [25,36], not, so no collision at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=7, for any y, no car covers 0, as we saw earlier.\n\nOnly t=8 and t=9 are dangerous.\n\nSo at t=6 and t=7, we can be on any y without issue.\n\nNow, we need to avoid being on y=1-8 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nt=8: after action at t=7? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, player is at position y_t.\n\nThen chooses action a_t, then moves to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nCollision checked at turn t based on y_t and cars at t.\n\nFor turn t=8, collision if y_8 in 1-8.\n\nSimilarly for t=9.\n\nTo not collide, at t=8, y_8 must be 0 or 9.\n\nSimilarly at t=9, y_9 must be 0 or 9.\n\nNow, player starts at t=6, y_6=1.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn, say t_final.\n\nSince we need min H, probably want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nBut we have to handle t=8 and t=9.\n\nFirst, let's see possible paths.\n\nOption 1: be at y=9 at t=8 or earlier.\n\nBut y=9 at t=8: from y=1 at t=6, to y=9 at t=8, that would require moving up 8 positions in 2 turns? From t=6 to t=7: one move, y_7 = y_6 + Δy_6, so y_7 between 0,1,2.\n\nThen t=7 to t=8: y_8 = y_7 + Δy_7.\n\nMax y_8 can be y_6 +2, since two up moves, so y_8 <= 1+2=3, cannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, min y_8=1-2=-1, but y>=0, so y=0.\n\nSo at t=8, possible y: min 0, max 3.\n\nCannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, y_9: from t=6, after 3 moves, y_9 <=1+3=4, min=0, so between 0 and 4, cannot be 9.\n\nt_final when y=9: since y starts at 1, each up move increases by one, so earliest y=9 is at t=6 + 8 =14, after 8 up moves.\n\ny_t at time t.\n\ny_6=1\n\nAfter action a_6, y_7 = y_6 + Δy_6\n\nAfter a_7, y_8 = y_7 + Δy_7\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t-1}, y_t = y_{t-1} + Δy_{t-1}\n\nTo have y_t =9, we need to have applied some sequence of U,D,S from t=6 to t-1.\n\nSince y_6=1, to reach y_t=9, the net up moves must be +8, so number of U minus number of D must be 8, and number of turns from t=6 to t-1 is (t-1) - 6 +1 = t-6 turns? Let's see.\n\nFrom t=6 to t, the position y_t depends on actions from t=6 to t-1, that's t-6 actions.\n\nFor example, to go from y_6 to y_7, action a_6, etc.\n\nThe sequence of actions: a_t for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and after H actions, we reach y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nStart at turn t_1=6, position (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,1)\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, we go to y_{t_1 +1}, and so on, after action a_{t_1 + H -1}, we reach y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nSo H is the number of actions, and we reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nt_1 + H = 6 + H.\n\nAnd we want min H.\n\nNow, at each turn t, we have position y_t, and for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, we might have collision if y_t in 1-8 and car covers 0, but only at t=8 and t=9 for now.\n\nt=8 and t=9 are absolute turns.\n\nNow, y_t at t=8 and t=9 must be 0 or 9 to avoid collision.\n\nBut as we saw, at t=8, y_8 <=3, since from t=6, after 2 actions, y_8 =1 + Δy_6 + Δy_7, each Δy in {-1,0,1}, so y_8 <=1+1+1=3, >=1-1-1= -1 but clamped to 0, so y_8 in {0,1,2,3}\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, y_9 = y_8 + Δy_8, so y_9 <=3+1=4, min=0-1= -1→0, so y_9 in {0,1,2,3,4}\n\nCannot be 9 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nTherefore, to avoid collision at t=8 and t=9, we must have y_8 =0 or y_9=0? y_8 must be 0, since it can't be 9, similarly y_9 must be 0, since it can't be 9.\n\ny_8 must be 0 (since 1-8 collision, 9 impossible), similarly y_9 must be 0.\n\nAt t=8, if y_8=0, safe; if y_8=1-8, collision; y_8=9 impossible.\n\nSimilarly for t=9.\n\nSo to be safe, at t=8, y_8 must be 0.\n\nAt t=9, y_9 must be 0.\n\nThen later, we can go up to 9.\n\nBut y_9=0, then we need to go from 0 to 9, which takes at least 9 up moves.\n\nBut we also have the constraint to reach y=9.\n\nNow, since we have to go down to 0 at t=8 and t=9, it will take more turns.\n\nWe might not need both, but let's see.\n\nFirst, at t=8, y_8 must be 0.\n\nAt t=9, y_9 must be 0.\n\nNow, from start: t=6, y=1.\n\nWe need to reach y_8=0.\n\ny_8 is after actions from t=6 to t=7.\n\nActions: a_6 and a_7 determine y_8.\n\ny_7 = y_6 + Δy_6 = 1 + Δa_6\n\nThen y_8 = y_7 + Δy_7 = 1 + Δa_6 + Δa_7\n\nWe need y_8 =0.\n\nSo 1 + Δa_6 + Δa_7 =0\n\nSince Δa in {-1,0,1}, so Δa_6 + Δa_7 = -1\n\nPossible: one down and one stay, or one down and one up but net -1? Down is -1, up +1, stay 0.\n\nSo Δa_6 + Δa_7 = -1\n\nPossibilities:\n\n- a_6 = D, a_7 = S: Δ = -1 + 0 = -1\n\n- a_6 = D, a_7 = D: Δ = -1 + -1 = -2, too low, but y_8 =1-2= -1, but y>=0, so probably clamped to 0? The problem says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if it goes below, set to 0.\n\nSimilarly above 9 set to 9.\n\nIn the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} \\in [0,9], so it is clamped.\n\nFor example, if y_t=0 and a_t=D, y_{t+1}=0 + (-1), but since y>=0, it stays 0.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 and U, stays 9.\n\nSo in this case, if we do a_6=D, a_7=D: y_7 = y_6 + Δa_6 =1 + (-1) =0 (since if it were -1, clamped to 0)\n\nThen y_8 = y_7 + Δa_7 =0 + (-1) =0 (clamped)\n\nSimilarly, if a_6=D, a_7=S: y_7=1-1=0, y_8=0+0=0\n\nIf a_6=S, a_7=D: y_7=1+0=1, y_8=1-1=0\n\nIf a_6=U, a_7=D: y_7=1+1=2, y_8=2-1=1, which is not 0.\n\nWe need y_8=0.\n\nSo possible actions:\n\n- a_6 = D, a_7 = S or D: both lead to y_8=0\n\n- a_6 = S, a_7 = D: y_8=0\n\n- a_6 = D, a_7 = D: y_8=0\n\n- a_6 = D, a_7 = S: y_8=0\n\n- a_6 = S, a_7 = D: y_8=0\n\nNot with U, since if a_6=U, y_7=2, then to get y_8=0, need Δy_7=-2, impossible, min -1 to y_8=1.\n\nSo only if we go down at some point.\n\nNow, similarly, at t=9, we need y_9=0.\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy_8\n\nBut y_8=0, so y_9 = 0 + Δy_8\n\nTo have y_9=0, we need Δy_8 <=0, so a_8 must be S or D.\n\nIf a_8=S, y_9=0\n\nIf a_8=D, y_9=0 (clamped)\n\nIf a_8=U, y_9=1\n\nBut we need y_9=0, so a_8 must be S or D.\n\nThen y_9=0.\n\nAfter that, we need to reach y=9 from y_9=0 at t=9.\n\nSo from t=9 onwards, we need to go up to 9.\n\nEach up move increases y by 1, so from y=0 to y=9, min 9 up moves.\n\nAfter action a_8, we have y_9.\n\nThen actions a_9 to a_{k} to reach y_m=9 for some m.\n\nAfter H actions, we reach y_{6+H}.\n\nWe need y_{6+H}=9.\n\nAt t=9, y_9=0.\n\nThen to reach y_{6+H}=9, we need to apply actions from t=9 to t=6+H-1.\n\nNumber of actions from t=9 to t=6+H-1 is (6+H-1) - 9 + 1 = H - 3? Let's see.\n\nActions from a_9 to a_{6+H-1}, that's (6+H-1) - 9 +1 = 6+H-1-9+1 = H -3 actions? Indices.\n\nTurn: after a_{t}, y_{t+1}\n\nAt turn t=9, y_9 is set.\n\nThen after action a_9, y_10; ... after action a_{k}, y_{k+1}\n\nSet y_{k+1} =9.\n\nk+1 = 6+H, so k = 6+H-1\n\nNow, from y_9 to y_{6+H}, we have actions a_9 to a_{6+H-1}, number of actions: (6+H-1) - 9 +1 = 6+H-1-9+1 = H - 3\n\nFor example, to go from y_9 to y_10, one action a_9, etc.\n\nEach action can change y by at most 1, so to go from y_9=0 to y_{6+H}=9, the net up moves needed is +9.\n\nSince we start at 0 and end at 9, net +9.\n\nEach U is +1, D is -1, S is 0.\n\nSo number of U minus number of D must be 9.\n\nTotal actions: let N = number of actions from a_9 to a_{6+H-1}, which is H-3.\n\nThen among these N actions, let U_num, D_num, S_num.\n\nU_num - D_num = 9\n\nAnd U_num + D_num + S_num = N\n\nThus U_num - D_num =9\n\nAdd: 2 U_num + S_num = 9 + N\n\nSince N = H-3\n\nMinimal N when no S or D, all U, then U_num=9, D_num=0, S_num=0, N=9.\n\nThen 2*9 +0 =18 =9 + N? 18=9+N, N=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIf we have S or D, N increases.\n\nSo min N=9 actions to go from y_9=0 to y_{9+9}=y_18=9? After a_9, y_10; after a_10, y_11; ... after a_{17}, y_{18}\n\ny_18 =9.\n\nThen H such that 6+H=18, so H=12.\n\nt_{t_1 + H} = y_{6+H} =9.\n\nAt t=9, y_9=0.\n\nAfter actions a_9 to a_{17}, 9 actions, all U, y_10=1, y_11=2, ..., y_18=9.\n\nSo we reach at turn 18.\n\nH=12 actions? From a_6 to a_{17}, that's actions at t=6 to t=17, 12 actions, reaching y_{18}=9.\n\nBut we also have actions before.\n\nWe need to consider the whole sequence.\n\nFirst, we need to have y_8=0 and y_9=0.\n\nWith actions a_6 and a_7.\n\nAs above, possible with a_6 and a_7 such that y_8=0.\n\nFor example, a_6=D, a_7=S: then y_7 = y_6 + Δa_6 =1 + (-1) =0 (since clamp down)\n\nThen y_8 = y_7 + Δa_7 =0 + 0 =0\n\nThen at t=8, y_8=0, safe.\n\nThen a_8: to have y_9=0, since y_8=0, a_8 must be S or D.\n\nSay a_8=S, then y_9=0\n\nThen from t=9, y_9=0, we need to go to y=9 with min actions.\n\na_9 to a_{17} all U: y_10=1, y_11=2, ..., y_18=9.\n\nSo actions: a_6=D, a_7=S, a_8=S, then a_9=U, a_10=U, ..., a_17=U.\n\nNumber of actions: from a_6 to a_17, that's 12 actions.\n\nH=12, reach at t=6+12=18.\n\nBut we might be able to reach earlier if we don't go to 0 at both, but we have to avoid collision at both t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=9, if y_9=0, safe, but if we can be at y=9 at t=9, but impossible as y_9<=4.\n\ny_9 max 4, as earlier.\n\nAnother option: we don't need to be at y=0 at both if we can be safe otherwise, but at t=8 and t=9, only safe if y=0, since y=9 impossible.\n\nSo must be at y=0 at t=8 and at t=9.\n\ny_8=0 and y_9=0.\n\nAs above.\n\nBut y_9=0 is achieved from y_8=0 with a_8=S or D.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have a_6=D, a_7=S, a_8=S, then up to a_17=U.\n\nBut H=12, but perhaps we can start going up earlier.\n\nFor example, after y_8=0, if at a_8 we do U, then y_9=1, but at t=9, y_9=1, which is between 1-8, and at t=9, collision, since all freeways have car covering x=0.\n\nSo we must have y_9=0, so we cannot do U at a_8.\n\nMust do S or D at a_8 to stay at 0.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut we are wasting turns at bottom.\n\nPerhaps go down later or something.\n\nAnother idea: go up as much as possible before t=8, but at t=8, we need to be at y=0.\n\nFrom t=6 to t=8, we have two actions: a_6 and a_7.\n\ny_6=1\n\nAfter a_6, y_7\n\nAfter a_7, y_8\n\nWe need y_8=0.\n\nAs before, y_8=0 only if we have net down, e.g., a_6=D, a_7=S: y_7=0, y_8=0\n\nOr a_6=S, a_7=D: y_7=1, y_8=0\n\nOr a_6=D, a_7=D: y_7=0, y_8=0\n\nIn all cases, y_7 is 0 or 1, but not higher.\n\nThen at t=8, y_8=0.\n\nThen a_8: must S or D to have y_9=0.\n\nSay a_8=S, y_9=0\n\nThen from t=9, go up.\n\nBut to reach y=9, from y_9=0, need 9 up moves, so y_10=1, y_11=2, ..., y_18=9.\n\nThus actions from a_9 to a_17: 9 U.\n\nTotal actions: a_6, a_7, a_8, plus a_9 to a_17, that's 3 + 9 =12 actions? a_6 to a_17 is 12 actions, yes.\n\nList turns:\n\nTurn t: action a_t, position y_t\n\nt=6: position y_6=1, perform a_6, then y_7 set.\n\nIn the sequence, at each turn, we have y_t, then action a_t, then y_{t+1}.\n\nBut collision checked at turn t based on y_t.\n\nFor output, we need actions from t_1 onwards.\n\nt_1=6.\n\nNow, with above: at t=6, y_6=1, no issue.\n\na_6 = D, then y_7 =1 + (-1) =0\n\nt=7: y_7=0, now at t=7, y=0, no freeway, safe. Perform a_7=S, then y_8=0 +0=0\n\nt=8: y_8=0, safe (not on freeway). Perform a_8=S, then y_9=0+0=0\n\nt=9: y_9=0, safe. Perform a_9=U, then y_10=0+1=1\n\nt=10: y_10=1, now at t=10, is there collision? Earlier we said only t=8 and t=9 dangerous, at t=10, no car covers x=0 on any freeway, so safe. Similarly for others.\n\ny_10=1, freeway y=1, at t=10, for freeway 1: cars, dt=10-6=4\n\nCar A: span [-23 + 6*4, -12 + 6*4] = [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nCar B: [25+24, 36+24]=[49,60], not. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nSo a_9=U, y_10=1\n\nt=10: y_10=1, safe, a_10=U, y_11=2\n\n...\nup to t=17: y_17=8, a_17=U, y_18=9\n\nThen at t=18, y_18=9, which is the target.\n\nH=12 actions, from a_6 to a_17.\n\nBut we can reach earlier? For example, if we don't stay at 0, but we have to be at 0 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=9, if we are at y=9, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=0 only at t=8, and at t=9 be elsewhere, but at t=9 we must be at 0 or 9, but 9 impossible, so must be 0.\n\nSimilarly for t=8.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nBut H=12 seems long, but is there a way with less?\n\nPerhaps we can go up after t=9 faster, but no, min 9 up moves from 0.\n\nAnother idea: maybe we don't need to be at y=0 at both t=8 and t=9 if we can be above or below, but below is only 0, above 9 impossible.\n\nPerhaps at t=8 we are at y=0, and at t=9 we are at y=0, but from y=0 at t=8, to y=9, we can start going up from t=9.\n\nBut with a_8, if we do U, y_9=1, but then at t=9 collision.\n\nSo must do S or D at a_8.\n\nThus, we are stuck at y=0 for turns 7,8,9.\n\ny_7=0, y_8=0, y_9=0.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nBut we can start going up earlier? From t=6, if we go up first, but then at t=8 we need to be at 0, which requires going down, but let's see.\n\nFor example, a_6=U, then y_7=1+1=2\n\nThen at t=7, y_7=2, safe since no collision at t=7.\n\nThen we need y_8=0.\n\nBut y_7=2, to get y_8=0, need Δy_7= -2, impossible, max down to y_8=1 (if a_7=D, y_8=2-1=1)\n\nThen at t=8, y_8=1, which is between 1-8, and at t=8, collision! Because car covers x=0 on freeway y=1.\n\nSimilarly, if y_8=1,2,3, all collision at t=8.\n\nOnly y_8=0 safe.\n\nBut from y_7=2, cannot reach y_8=0 in one step.\n\nIf a_6=S, y_7=1, then a_7=D, y_8=0.\n\nThat is possible, as I had earlier.\n\nWith a_6=S, a_7=D: y_7=1+0=1, then y_8=1-1=0.\n\nThen a_8 must be S or D to have y_9=0.\n\nSay a_8=S, y_9=0.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nCompared to first sequence, this has a_6=S instead of D, but y_7=1 instead of 0, but at t=7, no collision, so safe.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut still, from t=9, need to go up to 9.\n\nSo same number of turns.\n\nTo save one turn, but from y_9=0 to y=9, min 9 turns, reach at t=18.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 before t=18, but from y_9=0, after k actions, y_{9+k} <= k, so to have y=9, k>=9, so y_{18}=9 at earliest.\n\nThus min reach at t=18 with H=12.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nWe need to output actions from turn t_1=6 onwards.\n\nIn the sequence above, with a_6=S, a_7=D, a_8=S, then a_9 to a_17 all U.\n\na_6=S: stay, y_7=1\n\na_7=D: down, but y_7=1, down to y_8=0\n\na_8=S: stay, y_9=0\n\na_9=U: up to y_10=1\n\n...\n\na_17=U: to y_18=9\n\nNow, at which turn do we reach y=9? After a_17 at t=17, y_18=9.\n\nSo turn t=18, position (0,9).\n\nH=12 actions.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=0 at t=8, and at t=9 be at y=0, but then go up, but same.\n\nAnother thought: at t=9, if we are at y=9, but impossible.\n\nOr, perhaps we don't need to be at y=0 at t=9 if we can be on a freeway but no car, but at t=9, all freeways have car covering x=0, so only y=0 or 9 safe.\n\nBut y=9 not reachable.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps for some freeways, at t=9, no car, but from earlier, for all y=1-8, at t=9, the first car covers x=0, since [-5,6] includes 0.\n\nSo all covered.\n\nThus, must avoid y=1-8 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nThus, the only way is to be at y=0 at those turns.\n\nTherefore, min H=12.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier by going down later or something.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=6, we go up to y=2 or something.\n\na_6=U, y_7=2\n\nThen at t=7, y_7=2, safe.\n\nNow we need y_8=0, but from y_7=2, a_7=D, y_8=1, not 0.\n\na_7=D, y_8=2-1=1.\n\nThen at t=8, y_8=1, collision.\n\nIf we do a_7=D, but y_8=1.\n\nCannot get to 0.\n\nSo not possible.\n\na_6=D, y_7=0\n\nThen a_7=U, y_8=1, then at t=8, y_8=1, collision.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo only possibilities for first actions are to go down or stay to get y_8=0.\n\nSimilarly, then we must stay or down at a_8 to keep y_9=0.\n\nThen up.\n\nSo I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nBut let's check the car states again.\n\nIn freeway 5,6,7,8, there are other cars, but as we saw, they don't cause collision at other times.\n\nFor example, on freeway 5, second car (24,13,right,6), at t=6, span [13,24], at T, [13+6dt,24+6dt]\n\n0 covered when 13+6dt <=0<=24+6dt? Since right-moving, τ=13, h=24, so 13+6dt <=0<=24+6dt\n\nSo 6dt <= -13 and 0 <=24+6dt\n\n6dt <= -13 and 6dt >= -24\n\nAs before, only for negative dt.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, one possible sequence:\n\nTurn 6: S (stay, y_7=1)\n\nBut need to specify actions.\n\nIn the sequence: to have y_8=0, with a_6=S, a_7=D\n\nThen a_8=S\n\nThen a_9 to a_17: U each.\n\nBut a_17 is at t=17, to reach y_18=9.\n\nH=12 actions.\n\nWe can have a_6=D, a_7=S, a_8=S, same thing.\n\nOr a_6=S, a_7=D, a_8=D, but a_8=D, y_9=0 same.\n\nBut with a_8=D, y_9=0, but since y_8=0, it stays 0, same as S.\n\nNo difference.\n\nNow for output, we need the sequence.\n\nAlso, the player position at start is given, but we output actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions for turns starting t_1.\n\nt_1=6.\n\nSo actions from t=6 to t=6+H-1.\n\nWith H=12, actions at t=6 to t=17.\n\nSequence: for example:\n\nTurn 6: S  (a_6=S, y_7=1)\n\nTurn 7: D  (a_7=D, y_8=0)\n\nTurn 8: S  (a_8=S, y_9=0)\n\nThen Turn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 17: U\n\nBut Turn 17: a_17=U, y_18=9\n\nNow, how many U from turn 9 to 17? Turn 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17: that's 9 turns, actions a_9 to a_17.\n\na_9 to a_17 is 9 actions.\n\nTotal actions: t=6,7,8, and 9 to 17, that's 3 + 9 =12.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 6: S, turn 7: D, turn 8: S, turn 9: U, turn 10: U, ..., turn 17: U.\n\nBut turn 17 is the last action.\n\nAfter that, at turn 18, position is (0,9).\n\nTo write the actions.\n\nSince we need to reach at some turn, and H is min.\n\nBut is there a way with H=11? Suppose we reach at t=17.\n\ny_{6+H}=9, with H=11, then t=17.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at t=17, from y=1 at t=6, net +8 in 11 actions? From t=6 to t=17, after actions a_6 to a_{16}, y_{17}=9.\n\nNumber of actions: 11.\n\ny_{17} = y_6 + sum_{t=6}^{16} Δy_t\n\ny_6=1, y_{17}=9, so sum Δy = 8.\n\nWith 11 actions, possible, e.g., 9 U and 2 S, or 10 U and 2 D, etc., net +8.\n\nBut we have constraints at t=8 and t=9.\n\ny_8 must be 0, y_9 must be 0.\n\nNow, y_8 is after a_7, determined by a_6 and a_7.\n\ny_8=0 as before.\n\nSimilarly, y_9= y_8 + Δy_8 = 0 + Δy_8, so to have y_9=0, Δy_8 <=0, so a_8=S or D.\n\nThen y_9=0.\n\nNow, from t=9 to t=17, we have actions a_9 to a_{16}, 8 actions.\n\ny_9=0, y_{17}=9, so net +9 in 8 actions? Impossible, since each action at most +1, min 9 actions to go from 0 to 9.\n\nWith 8 actions, max y_{17}=8, cannot reach 9.\n\nThus, impossible to reach at t=17 with y_{17}=9 from y_9=0.\n\nSimilarly, with H=11, reach at t=17, but from y_9=0 at t=9, after 8 actions, y_{17} <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nIf we reach earlier, but y_9=0, and t=9 is fixed, cannot reach before t=18.\n\nThus, min H=12, reach at t=18.\n\nSo the sequence must include the actions to stay at 0 during critical times.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nWe need to write the actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, with a_6=S, a_7=D, a_8=S, then a_9 to a_{17} all U.\n\na_9 to a_{17} is 9 actions, but t=9 to t=17.\n\nt=17: a_{17}, then y_{18}=9.\n\nIn the action list, we have from turn t=6 to t=17.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn 6: a_{6}\n\nTurn 7: a_{7}\n\n...\n\nTurn 17: a_{17}\n\nWith actions: S, D, S, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U\n\nFrom turn 9 to 17: 9 U, but turns: turn 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17: that's 9 turns.\n\nTotal from turn 6 to 17: 12 turns.\n\nList:\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nAfter Turn 17 action, position y_{18}=9.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 6: action S, then y_7=1\n\nBut collision at turn t based on y_t, at t=6, y=1, safe; t=7, y=0, safe; t=8, y=0, safe; t=9, y=0, safe; then t=10, y=1, but no collision, etc.\n\nAll good.\n\nWe could have a_6=D, a_7=S, a_8=S, same thing.\n\nOr a_6=S, a_7=D, a_8=D, etc.\n\nBut minimal turns is the same.\n\nNow, in the car state, for freeway 5-8, there are cars at (24,13) etc., but they don't affect, as we saw.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,1), and we need to reach (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, when we go down or stay, we are at y=0 or 1, but no issue except at t=8,9.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nSo the minimal H is 12.\n\nAnd sequence as above.\n\nBut in the output, it should be in the box.\n\nPerhaps we can write it compactly.\n\nBut in the format, it says list each turn.\n\nSince from turn 9 to 17 all U, we can say, but better to list.\n\nNow, I think this is correct.\n\nBut let me confirm the turns.\n\nt_1=6.\n\nActions from t=6 to t=6+H-1=6+12-1=17.\n\nYes.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nIn the action, at turn 8: S, y_9=0, then turn 9: U, y_10=1, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nTo make it clear.\n\nSo the answer should be this sequence.\n\nBut in the initial, player is at (0,1), and after actions, reach (0,9) at turn 18.\n\nBut the task is to find H and actions to reach in H turns.\n\nH=12.\n\nNow for the box.\n\nPerhaps we can write:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 6: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: & U \\end{array} }\n\nBut this is for turns 6 to 17, 12 actions.\n\nTo save space, but I think it's fine.\n\nSince turns 9 to 17 all U, but in text, we can write.\n\nBut in the format, it should be clear.\n\nI think this is acceptable.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) is 12. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (a safe position with no cars) during the dangerous turns \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\), when cars cover \\(x = 0\\) on all freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n- At \\(t = 6\\), the player is at \\(y = 1\\).

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 7, and the player is at (0,1). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe car update rules: \n- Each car moves at constant speed. For right-moving cars: at time T, the car that was at [τ, h] at t1 becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n- Similarly, left-moving cars move left, but in this problem all cars are right-moving (direction is right).\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (which must be between 1 and 8) and the player's x=0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that exact turn T.\n\nImportant note: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on freeway y_T at turn T (so we check cars on y_T at turn T) and then moves to y_{T+1} for the next turn. So at turn T, we are on the freeway of the current y (before the move) and we check that freeway.\n\nThe goal: minimize H (number of turns) and provide the sequence of actions starting at turn t1 (which is turn 7) until we reach y=9.\n\nCurrent state at turn t1=7:\n- Player: (0,1)\n\nCars on each freeway (k=1 to 8):\n\nFor freeways 1 to 4:\n  Two cars: \n    car1: h=-6, τ=-17, d=right, s=6 -> at turn 7: [τ, h] = [-17, -6] (since right-moving, head is at the right end, so head is -6 and tail is -17? But note: the representation is (head, tail) and for right-moving, the head is the rightmost? Actually, the update rule for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. But note the initial span at t1: they give (head, tail) and then for right-moving, the head is the leading part? \n\nBut in the update rule for right-moving: \n  Initially at t1: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut wait, the car state is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost point? Then the tail would be the leftmost? So the span is [tail, head]? \n\nLooking at the update:\n  Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo at t1, the car occupies the interval [τ, h]. \n\nBut in the input, for freeway 1: \n  (-6, -17, right, 6) and (42, 31, right, 6)\n\nWait: the first car: head=-6, tail=-17? Then the span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-17, -6]. Similarly, the second car: head=42, tail=31 -> [31,42]. \n\nBut note: if tail=-17 and head=-6, then the car is from x=-17 to x=-6? That seems backwards? Because typically we think head as the front. For a right-moving car, the front (head) should be at a higher x than the tail. But here, for the first car: head=-6 and tail=-17: that would mean the head is at -6 and tail at -17, so the car spans from -17 to -6? Then indeed the head is at the right (since -6 > -17). Similarly, the second car: head=42, tail=31: then the car is from 31 to 42? That makes sense: the head (front) is at 42 and tail at 31.\n\nSo the representation: (head, tail) for a right-moving car: the head is the rightmost, tail the leftmost.\n\nTherefore, at any time T, the car's span is [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for freeways 5 to 8, there are three cars each.\n\nWe need to plan from turn 7 (current turn) until we get to y=9.\n\nAt each turn, we can choose U (move up), D (move down), or S (stay). But note the grid: y from 0 to 9. We start at y=1. We want to get to y=9. We can only move one step at a time? Actually, the update: \n  if U: y_{t+1} = y_t + 1\n  if D: y_{t+1} = y_t - 1\n  if S: y_{t+1} = y_t\n\nBut note: the player's y must be in [0,9]. So if we are at y=0, we cannot go down. Similarly, at y=9 we cannot go up.\n\nWe start at y=1 at turn 7. We want to get to y=9. The minimal number of moves without any obstacles would be 8 moves (each U). But we have to avoid the cars on freeways 1 to 8 at the times we are on those freeways.\n\nImportant: we are only on a freeway when y is between 1 and 8. And at the turn when we are on a freeway, we check if at that turn, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0.\n\nNote: the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8) and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T, then collision.\n\nBut note: if we move from freeway i to freeway j at turn T, then at turn T we are still on freeway i (and we check freeway i at turn T). Then at turn T+1, we are on freeway j.\n\nWe are starting at turn t1=7 at y=1. So at turn 7, we are on freeway 1? Actually, the freeways are labeled by the y-coordinate. So when the player is at y=k (for k=1..8) at a turn, then we check freeway k at that turn.\n\nOur plan: we need to choose a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves the player from y=1 to y=9 without being in a freeway (1 to 8) at a turn when a car on that freeway covers x=0.\n\nWe are allowed to stay in place (S) to wait for cars to pass, or even move down to avoid a collision? But moving down would take us away from the goal. However, sometimes it might be necessary? But note: we start at y=1 and want to go to y=9, so moving down might not be helpful unless we are forced to avoid a collision and then come back? But that would cost more turns. We want minimal H.\n\nSince we are minimizing the number of turns, we want to go up as much as possible. But we have to avoid collisions.\n\nWe must check for each freeway and each turn whether there is a car that covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's define the time relative to t1=7. Let τ = T - t1, so at the current turn (t1=7) we have τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0 (turn 7): \n  Player at y=1 -> so we are on freeway 1.\n\nWe must check freeway 1 at τ=0 (turn 7): \n  Cars on freeway 1 at τ=0:\n    car1: [tail, head] = [-17, -6] -> at τ=0: [-17, -6]? \n        Actually, the car's position at time T (which is t1+τ) is:\n          tail + s*τ, head + s*τ\n        So at τ=0: tail=-17, head=-6 -> span [-17, -6]. \n        Does 0 lie in [-17,-6]? No, because -6 < 0? Actually, -17 to -6 is all negative, so 0 is not in the interval.\n\n    car2: tail=31, head=42 -> [31,42] -> 0 is not in [31,42].\n\nSo at turn 7, freeway 1 is safe.\n\nTherefore, we can start by moving up? But note: we have to choose an action at turn 7. We can choose U, D, or S.\n\nIf we choose U at turn 7 (τ=0): then at the next state (turn 8, τ=1) we will be at y=2.\n\nBut first, at turn 7 we are at y=1 and we choose an action. The action we choose at turn 7 will determine our position at turn 8.\n\nHowever, we must check the freeway we are on at turn 7 (which is y=1) and we just did: safe.\n\nNow, what if we choose U at turn 7? Then at turn 8 we will be at y=2.\n\nBut at turn 8, we are on freeway 2? So we must check freeway 2 at turn 8 (τ=1).\n\nSimilarly, we have to plan ahead.\n\nWe can try to simulate step by step, but we want the minimal H. So ideally, we want to go up as quickly as possible. The minimal H would be 8 (if we go up 8 times: from 1 to 9 in 8 moves). But we have to check if that path is safe.\n\nLet me check for each freeway k at the time we would be on it if we go straight up.\n\nAssume we take U at every turn.\n\nTurn 7 (τ=0): at y=1 -> freeway 1: safe (as above).\n\nTurn 8 (τ=1): at y=2 -> freeway 2 at τ=1.\n\n  Freeway 2 has the same cars as freeway 1: two cars: \n      car1: at τ=1: [-17 + 6*1, -6 + 6*1] = [-11, 0] -> wait, 0 is included? [-11,0] includes 0? Yes, because 0 is between -11 and 0? But note: the interval is inclusive? The problem says \"if 0 in Span(T)\", so if the car covers 0 then collision.\n\n  So at τ=1, car1 on freeway 2: span = [-11, 0]. So 0 is in the span -> collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on freeway 2 at turn 8 (τ=1) if we go up at turn 7.\n\nSo we cannot go straight up at turn 7? Then what?\n\nWe might have to wait at y=1 for one turn? Or maybe move down? But moving down would take us to y=0 at turn 8, but then we are not on a freeway (since freeways are y=1..8) so no collision? But then we are at y=0 and we have to come back up, which will cost extra turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can stay at y=1 at turn 7? Then at turn 7 we choose S. Then at turn 8 we are still at y=1. Then we check:\n\nAt turn 7: we are at y=1 (freeway1) at τ=0: safe (as above).\nAt turn 8: we are at y=1 (freeway1) at τ=1: \n  Freeway1 at τ=1:\n      car1: [-17+6, -6+6] = [-11,0] -> includes 0? Yes! So collision.\n\nTherefore, staying at y=1 at turn 8 (by choosing S at turn 7) would also cause a collision at turn 8 on freeway1.\n\nSo both U and S at turn 7 lead to collision at turn 8? What about D?\n\nIf we choose D at turn 7: then at turn 8 we go to y=0. Then at turn 8 we are at y=0. Since freeways are from y=1 to 8, being at y=0 means we are not on any freeway -> no collision check.\n\nThen at turn 8 (τ=1) we are at y=0.\n\nBut then we are not at the goal. We have to get to y=9.\n\nAt turn 8, we can choose an action: \n  If we choose U: then at turn 9 we go to y=1.\n  But at turn 9 (τ=2) we would be at y=1 -> freeway1 at τ=2.\n\nCheck freeway1 at τ=2:\n  car1: [-17+6*2, -6+6*2] = [-5, 6] -> 0 is in [-5,6]? Yes, because -5<=0<=6 -> collision.\n\nAlternatively, at turn 8 (at y=0) we could choose to stay? Then at turn 9 we are still at y=0 -> safe (no freeway). Then at turn 10 we go to y=1: then we are at freeway1 at τ=3.\n\nCheck freeway1 at τ=3:\n  car1: [-17+18, -6+18] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12]? No, so safe? \n  car2: [31+6*3, 42+6*3] = [31+18,42+18] = [49,60] -> 0 not in there.\n\nSo at τ=3 (turn 10) we are at y=1: safe.\n\nThen we can proceed? But this is taking more turns.\n\nWe need minimal H. So we want to avoid waiting too long.\n\nMaybe we can try to skip freeway2 at τ=1? Because we saw that at τ=1, freeway2 is dangerous (because of car1). But also freeway1 at τ=1 is dangerous. So we cannot be on freeway1 or freeway2 at τ=1.\n\nWhat about freeway3 at τ=1? We would be on freeway3 at τ=1 if we go up twice? But we can't even get past freeway2 at τ=1 without being hit.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to go up to freeway3 at τ=0? But we start at y=1 at τ=0. We can only move one per turn.\n\nWait, we are at τ=0 at y=1. We cannot jump to y=3 in one move.\n\nSo we must pass through freeway2 at some τ. But at τ=1, freeway2 is dangerous. So we must avoid freeway2 at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway1 is dangerous at τ=1.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeway1 and freeway2 at τ=1.\n\nBut we start at freeway1 at τ=0. Then at τ=0 we can choose:\n\nOption 1: D -> to y=0 at τ=1 (safe, no freeway).\nOption 2: S -> to y=1 at τ=1 (collision).\nOption 3: U -> to y=2 at τ=1 (collision).\n\nSo the only safe choice at τ=0 (turn7) is D: move down to y=0.\n\nThen at τ=1 (turn8) we are at y=0.\n\nNow at τ=1 (turn8) we are at y=0. We can choose:\n\n- U: go to y=1 at τ=2 (turn9) -> then we are on freeway1 at τ=2: check freeway1 at τ=2:\n      car1: [-17+12, -6+12] = [-5,6] -> 0 in [-5,6]? Yes -> collision.\n\n- S: stay at y=0 -> safe (no freeway). Then at τ=2 (turn9) we are at y=0.\n\n- D: not possible? y cannot go below 0? The update says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we are at y=0 and choose D, we remain at 0? Actually, the update: \n      if a_t = D: y_{t+1} = y_t - 1, but then clamped to [0,9]. So if y_t=0, then D would result in y_{t+1}=0.\n\nSo at τ=1 (turn8) at y=0, we can choose S or D (both result in staying at 0) or U (which would go to 1).\n\nIf we choose S or D at turn8: then we remain at y=0 at turn9 (τ=2).\n\nThen at turn9 (τ=2) we are at y=0. Then we can choose U to go to y=1 at τ=3 (turn10).\n\nAt turn10 (τ=3) we are at y=1 -> freeway1 at τ=3:\n      car1: [-17+18, -6+18] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n      car2: [31+18,42+18] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen we are at y=1 at turn10. Now we want to go up.\n\nBut we have to get to y=9. We need to go through freeways 1 to 8.\n\nBut note: we are at τ=3 at y=1.\n\nWe want to go up as fast as possible, but we have to avoid collisions.\n\nLet me check the next freeways at the times we would be on them if we go up continuously.\n\nBut the time τ is increasing. We are at τ=3 at y=1.\n\nIf we go up at turn10: to y=2 at τ=4 (turn11).\n\nCheck freeway2 at τ=4:\n  Freeway2 has the same cars as freeway1: \n      car1: [-17+6*4, -6+6*4] = [-17+24, -6+24] = [7,18] -> 0 not in [7,18] -> safe?\n      car2: [31+24,42+24] = [55,66] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway2 at τ=4 is safe.\n\nThen at turn11 (τ=4) we are at y=2 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn11 we choose U: then at turn12 (τ=5) we go to y=3.\n\nFreeway3 at τ=5:\n  Same cars: \n      car1: [-17+30, -6+30] = [13,24] -> safe.\n      car2: [31+30,42+30] = [61,72] -> safe.\n\nSafe.\n\nThen at turn12 (τ=5) we are at y=3 -> safe.\n\nThen choose U: at turn13 (τ=6) to y=4.\n\nFreeway4 at τ=6:\n  car1: [-17+36, -6+36] = [19,30] -> safe.\n  car2: [31+36,42+36] = [67,78] -> safe.\n\nSafe.\n\nThen at turn13 (τ=6) we are at y=4 -> safe.\n\nThen choose U: at turn14 (τ=7) to y=5.\n\nNow freeway5: but freeway5 has three cars. At τ=7 (turn14) for freeway5:\n  car1: [-17+6*7, -6+6*7] = [-17+42, -6+42] = [25,36] -> safe.\n  car2: [30+42, 19+42]? Wait, wait! The car is given as (head, tail). For the second car: head=30, tail=19? But that would be [19,30] at τ=0? But wait: the update for right-moving: [τ + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]. So the head is the rightmost? Then at τ=0: [tail, head] = [19,30]. \n\n  So at τ=7: [19+6*7, 30+6*7] = [19+42, 30+42] = [61,72] -> safe.\n\n  car3: (-48, -59, right, 6): head=-48, tail=-59 -> at τ=0: [-59,-48]. At τ=7: [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17, -6] -> 0 not in [-17,-6]? It is negative, so safe.\n\nSo freeway5 at τ=7 is safe.\n\nThen at turn14 (τ=7) we are at y=5 -> safe.\n\nThen choose U: at turn15 (τ=8) to y=6.\n\nFreeway6 at τ=8:\n  car1: [-17+48, -6+48] = [31,42] -> 0 not in [31,42] -> safe.\n  car2: [19+48,30+48] = [67,78] -> safe.\n  car3: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> includes 0? Yes! So collision.\n\nTherefore, if we go to freeway6 at τ=8, we collide with car3.\n\nSo we cannot go to y=6 at τ=8.\n\nTherefore, at turn14 (when we are at y=5) we cannot choose U? Then we must choose S or D.\n\nBut if we choose S at turn14: we stay at y=5 at τ=8 (turn15).\n\nBut then we are on freeway5 at τ=8? Check freeway5 at τ=8:\n  car1: [-17+48, -6+48] = [31,42] -> safe.\n  car2: [19+48,30+48] = [67,78] -> safe.\n  car3: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> includes 0 -> collision.\n\nSo staying at y=5 at τ=8 is also unsafe.\n\nWhat about D? Then we go down to y=4 at τ=8 (turn15). Then we are on freeway4 at τ=8.\n\nCheck freeway4: \n  At τ=8, freeway4 has two cars (same as freeway1? But freeway4 originally had two cars: (-6,-17,right,6) and (42,31,right,6) -> wait, no: the car state is per freeway.\n\nLooking back:\n\nFreeway4: \n  Cars: (-6, -17, right, 6) and (42,31,right,6) -> so the same as freeway1.\n\nAt τ=8 for freeway4:\n  car1: [-17+48, -6+48] = [31,42] -> safe.\n  car2: [31+48,42+48] = [79,90] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway4 at τ=8 is safe.\n\nTherefore, at turn14 (τ=7) we are at y=5. Instead of going up (which would lead to y=6 at τ=8 and collision) or staying (collision), we can go down to y=4 at τ=8 (turn15) and avoid collision.\n\nThen at turn15 (τ=8) we are at y=4 -> safe.\n\nBut we are now at y=4 and we want to go to y=9. We have to go up again.\n\nWe need to get past freeway5 and freeway6 without collision.\n\nAt τ=8 we are at y=4. We can then go up to y=5 at τ=9 (turn16).\n\nCheck freeway5 at τ=9:\n  car1: [-17+54, -6+54] = [37,48] -> safe.\n  car2: [19+54,30+54] = [73,84] -> safe.\n  car3: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6] -> 0 in [-5,6] -> collision.\n\nSo if we go to y=5 at τ=9, we collide.\n\nSo we cannot go to y=5 at τ=9.\n\nWe can stay at y=4 for one more turn? Then at turn16 we choose S: so at τ=9 (turn16) we are at y=4 -> freeway4 at τ=9.\n\nCheck freeway4 at τ=9:\n  car1: [-17+54, -6+54] = [37,48] -> safe.\n  car2: [31+54,42+54] = [85,96] -> safe.\n\nSafe.\n\nThen at turn16 (τ=9) we are at y=4.\n\nThen at turn17 (τ=10) we can choose to go up to y=5: then at τ=10 we are on freeway5.\n\nCheck freeway5 at τ=10:\n  car1: [-17+60, -6+60] = [43,54] -> safe.\n  car2: [19+60,30+60] = [79,90] -> safe.\n  car3: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen at turn17 (τ=10) we are at y=5 -> safe.\n\nThen we can continue going up? But we have to check the next ones.\n\nAt turn17 we are at y=5. Then at turn18 (τ=11) we go to y=6: freeway6 at τ=11.\n\nCheck freeway6 at τ=11:\n  car1: [-17+66, -6+66] = [49,60] -> safe.\n  car2: [19+66,30+66] = [85,96] -> safe.\n  car3: [-59+66, -48+66] = [7,18] -> safe.\n\nSafe.\n\nThen at turn19 (τ=12) we go to y=7: freeway7 at τ=12.\n\nFreeway7 has the same cars as freeway5? Actually, freeway7 has three cars: same as freeway5? \n  car1: [-17+72, -6+72] = [55,66] -> safe.\n  car2: [19+72,30+72] = [91,102] -> safe.\n  car3: [-59+72, -48+72] = [13,24] -> safe.\n\nSafe.\n\nThen at turn20 (τ=13) we go to y=8: freeway8 at τ=13.\n\nFreeway8: same cars? \n  car1: [-17+78, -6+78] = [61,72] -> safe.\n  car2: [19+78,30+78] = [97,108] -> safe.\n  car3: [-59+78, -48+78] = [19,30] -> safe.\n\nSafe.\n\nThen at turn21 (τ=14) we go to y=9: and we are done. Because at y=9 we are not on a freeway? The freeways are y=1 to 8. So when we are at y=9, we don't check any freeway.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nWe start at turn7 (τ=0) at y=1.\n\nAction at turn7: D -> to y=0 at turn8 (τ=1).\nAt turn8: we are at y=0. We choose S (or D, same) to stay at y=0 at turn9 (τ=2).\nAt turn9: we are at y=0. We choose U -> to y=1 at turn10 (τ=3): safe.\nAt turn10: at y=1. We choose U -> to y=2 at turn11 (τ=4): safe.\nAt turn11: at y=2. U -> to y=3 at turn12 (τ=5): safe.\nAt turn12: at y=3. U -> to y=4 at turn13 (τ=6): safe.\nAt turn13: at y=4. U -> to y=5 at turn14 (τ=7): safe.\nAt turn14: at y=5. We cannot go up because at τ=8, freeway6 would be unsafe. So we go down: D -> to y=4 at turn15 (τ=8): safe.\nAt turn15: at y=4. Then we wait? \n  We can choose to stay at y=4 for one turn: at turn16 (τ=9) we are at y=4: safe.\nAt turn16: at y=4. Then we choose U -> to y=5 at turn17 (τ=10): safe.\nAt turn17: at y=5. U -> to y=6 at turn18 (τ=11): safe.\nAt turn18: at y=6. U -> to y=7 at turn19 (τ=12): safe.\nAt turn19: at y=7. U -> to y=8 at turn20 (τ=13): safe.\nAt turn20: at y=8. U -> to y=9 at turn21 (τ=14): done.\n\nTotal turns: from turn7 to turn21? That's 21-7 = 14 moves? But we start at turn7 and do 14 actions? Then we are at turn7+14 = turn21.\n\nBut we can count the number of actions: from t=7 to t=20 (inclusive) we do 14 actions? Actually, the sequence of actions is for t=7,8,...,20: 14 actions? But we end at turn21? \n\nThe player position at turn21: y=9.\n\nBut let me list the turns and positions:\n\nTurn7: start at y=1, choose D -> then at turn8: y=0.\nTurn8: at y=0, choose S -> turn9: y=0.\nTurn9: at y=0, choose U -> turn10: y=1.\nTurn10: at y=1, U -> turn11: y=2.\nTurn11: at y=2, U -> turn12: y=3.\nTurn12: at y=3, U -> turn13: y=4.\nTurn13: at y=4, U -> turn14: y=5.\nTurn14: at y=5, D -> turn15: y=4.\nTurn15: at y=4, S? (or we could choose to go up? But we have to wait for τ to advance so that freeway5 becomes safe at τ=10) \n  We choose S: then turn16: y=4.\nTurn16: at y=4, U -> turn17: y=5.\nTurn17: at y=5, U -> turn18: y=6.\nTurn18: at y=6, U -> turn19: y=7.\nTurn19: at y=7, U -> turn20: y=8.\nTurn20: at y=8, U -> turn21: y=9.\n\nSo we have 14 actions: from turn7 to turn20.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nWe spent two turns going down and waiting (turn7: D, turn8: S, turn9: U) to get back to y=1 at τ=3.\n\nThen we went up without interruption until turn14 (at y=5) but then we had to go down (turn14: D) to avoid collision at τ=8, then wait one turn (turn15: S) and then go up again.\n\nTotal turns: 14.\n\nBut we might be able to avoid the extra wait at y=4? \n\nAfter we go down to y=4 at turn15 (τ=8), we could go up immediately at turn15? Then at turn16 (τ=9) we would be at y=5: but then freeway5 at τ=9: car3: [-5,6] -> collision. So we must wait until τ=10 to be at y=5.\n\nSo we have to wait at y=4 for one turn (turn15: S) and then at turn16: U to y=5 at τ=10.\n\nSo that wait is necessary.\n\nAlternatively, could we have avoided going down at y=5? \n\nAt turn14 (τ=7) we are at y=5. Instead of going down, we could have stayed? But we saw that staying at y=5 at τ=8 (turn15) is unsafe. And going up is unsafe. So we must leave freeway5 at τ=8? The only safe move is down to freeway4 (which we did).\n\nBut what about moving down earlier? For example, at an earlier freeway we might wait to avoid the collision at freeway6 at τ=8.\n\nBut we were moving up continuously from τ=3 to τ=7. We arrived at y=5 at τ=7. Then we have to avoid being at freeway6 at τ=8? So we must not be at y=6 at τ=8.\n\nBut we are at y=5 at τ=7. The only way to avoid being at y=6 at τ=8 is to not go up at τ=7. So we have to choose S or D at turn14 (τ=7). And we saw S leads to being at y=5 at τ=8 -> unsafe. So we must go down to y=4 at τ=8.\n\nTherefore, the path we have is necessary.\n\nBut can we save turns by not waiting at y=0 for two turns? \n\nAt the beginning, we went down at turn7 (to y=0 at τ=1), then stayed at turn8 (y=0 at τ=2), then up at turn9 (y=1 at τ=3). That's 3 turns to get back to y=1 at τ=3.\n\nBut we could have stayed at y=0 for only one turn? \n\nAt turn7: D -> y=0 at τ=1 (safe).\nAt turn8: U -> then at τ=2 (turn9) we are at y=1 -> freeway1 at τ=2: car1: [-5,6] -> collision.\n\nSo we must wait at least until τ=3 to be at y=1? So we need to be at y=1 at τ>=3? \n\nWe were at τ=0 at y=1. Then we moved down to y=0 at τ=1. Then we have to wait at y=0 until τ>=3? So we must spend two turns at y=0: one at τ=1 and one at τ=2, then at τ=3 we go to y=1.\n\nSo that part is fixed.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 14 turns? But let me check if we can do it in less.\n\nAlternatively, we might go up to y=9 by a different route? For example, we might go up to y=3 and then wait, etc. But we have to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nNote that freeway6 is dangerous at τ=8 because of car3: [-11,0]. But it becomes safe at τ=11: [7,18] (which is positive and above 0) and then stays safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5 is dangerous at τ=8,9? \n  At τ=8: car3: [-11,0] -> dangerous.\n  At τ=9: car3: [-5,6] -> dangerous.\n  At τ=10: [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeway5 at τ=8 and τ=9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6: dangerous at τ=8? \n  At τ=8: car3: [-11,0] -> dangerous.\n  At τ=9: car3: [-5,6] -> dangerous?\n  But wait: freeway6 at τ=8: car3: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> dangerous.\n  At τ=9: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6] -> dangerous.\n  At τ=10: [1,12] -> safe.\n\nActually, freeway6 at τ=9 is also dangerous? But we are going to freeway6 at τ=11 which is safe.\n\nBut note: we are at y=5 at τ=10 (safe) and then to y=6 at τ=11 (safe).\n\nBut we must also avoid freeway5 at τ=8 and τ=9.\n\nSo we must be at y=5 only at τ=10 or later? and at y=6 at τ=11 or later.\n\nBut we are at y=4 at τ=6 (turn13) and we go to y=5 at τ=7 (turn14) which is safe? Then we have to leave y=5 by τ=8? because at τ=8, if we are at y=5 it's unsafe. So we go down to y=4 at τ=8 (turn15). Then we wait at y=4 for τ=9 (turn16) and then go up to y=5 at τ=10? \n\nBut τ=9 is at turn16? How do we get from τ=8 (turn15) to τ=10 (turn17) at y=5? \n\nAt turn15: we are at y=4 and τ=8. We choose an action at turn15: \n  If we choose S: then at turn16 (τ=9) we are at y=4 -> safe.\n  Then at turn16 we choose U: then at turn17 (τ=10) we are at y=5 -> safe.\n\nSo that's what we did.\n\nIf we choose U at turn15 (τ=8) from y=4: then we go to y=5 at τ=9 (turn16): but that is unsafe (freeway5 at τ=9: collision).\n\nSo we must not do that.\n\nTherefore, the sequence we have is minimal? \n\nBut note: we are spending a lot of turns. Is there a way to go faster?\n\nAnother idea: after we get to y=1 at τ=3, we could wait at y=1 for one more turn? Then at τ=4 we are at y=1? \n  At τ=4: freeway1: \n      car1: [-17+24, -6+24] = [7,18] -> safe.\n      car2: [31+24,42+24] = [55,66] -> safe.\n  Then we go to y=2 at τ=5: freeway2 at τ=5: \n      car1: [-17+30, -6+30] = [13,24] -> safe.\n      car2: [31+30,42+30] = [61,72] -> safe.\n  Then to y=3 at τ=6: safe as before.\n  Then to y=4 at τ=7: safe.\n  Then to y=5 at τ=8: unsafe? because freeway5 at τ=8: car3: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSame problem.\n\nWe could wait at y=4? At τ=6 we are at y=4. Instead of going to y=5 at τ=7, we could stay at y=4 at τ=7: \n  freeway4 at τ=7: \n      car1: [-17+42, -6+42] = [25,36] -> safe.\n      car2: [31+42,42+42] = [73,84] -> safe.\n  Then at τ=7 we are safe at y=4.\n\nThen at τ=8 (turn15) we go to y=5? But freeway5 at τ=8: unsafe.\n\nSo we must not be at y=5 at τ=8.\n\nThen we could go to y=5 at τ=10? How? \n\nWe are at y=4 at τ=7 (turn14). Then we can wait at y=4 for two turns: \n  turn14: S -> at turn15 (τ=8) we are at y=4: safe.\n  turn15: S -> at turn16 (τ=9) we are at y=4: safe.\n  turn16: U -> at turn17 (τ=10) we are at y=5: safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=5 at τ=10. Then we go up: \n  turn17: U -> turn18 (τ=11) at y=6: safe.\n  turn18: U -> turn19 (τ=12) at y=7: safe.\n  turn19: U -> turn20 (τ=13) at y=8: safe.\n  turn20: U -> turn21 (τ=14) at y=9.\n\nThis is 14 actions as well? And we avoided the down move? \n\nBut in this scenario, at turn14 (when we are at y=4 at τ=7) we choose S (stay) instead of going up to y=5. Then we wait two turns at y=4 (turn14: S -> still at y=4 at τ=8; turn15: S -> y=4 at τ=9) and then at turn16 (τ=9) we go to y=5? But wait: at τ=9, freeway5 is unsafe? Because at τ=9: car3: [-5,6] -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot go to y=5 at τ=9. We must go at τ=10.\n\nTherefore, we must wait until τ=10 to be at y=5. So we have to be at y=4 until at least τ=9? Then at τ=10 we go to y=5.\n\nSo from τ=7 to τ=9: we are at y=4 (three turns: turn13: y=4 at τ=6; turn14: S -> τ=7 y=4; turn15: S -> τ=8 y=4; turn16: S -> τ=9 y=4; then turn17: U -> τ=10 y=5). \n\nBut that is 4 turns at y=4? We started at y=4 at τ=6 (turn13). Then we do three S: at τ=7,8,9 (turns14,15,16). Then at turn17 (τ=10) we go to y=5.\n\nThat is 4 turns (from turn13 to turn16) at y=4? That is worse.\n\nAlternatively, we could go down to y=3 at τ=8? But then we have to come back.\n\nBut that would be even more turns.\n\nSo the original plan of going to y=5 at τ=7 and then down to y=4 at τ=8, then wait one turn at y=4 (τ=9) and then up at τ=10 is the most efficient.\n\nTherefore, the sequence we have is minimal.\n\nBut we can avoid the down move? \n\nWe are at y=5 at τ=7 (safe). We want to avoid freeway5 at τ=8 and τ=9. But we are already at y=5 at τ=7. We can only move to adjacent y. So we have to move to y=4, y=5, or y=6. But y=6 at τ=8 is unsafe. y=5 at τ=8 is unsafe. So we must move to y=4 at τ=8.\n\nNo alternative.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 14.\n\nBut let me count the actions:\n\nTurn7: D\nTurn8: S (or D, same effect) -> we choose S for clarity? But D at y=0 also stays at 0.\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: D  (from y=5 to y=4)\nTurn15: S  (wait at y=4)\nTurn16: U\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\nTurn19: U\nTurn20: U\n\nThat's 14 actions.\n\nBut at turn14: we are at y=5, then we choose D -> to y=4 at turn15.\nAt turn15: we are at y=4, then we choose S -> stay at y=4 at turn16.\nAt turn16: we choose U -> to y=5 at turn17.\n\nThen from turn17 to turn20: four U's: to y=9 at turn21.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 7: D\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: D\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\n\nBut wait, at turn13 we did U to get to y=5 at turn14? \n  Turn13: at y=4, choose U -> turn14: y=5.\nThen turn14: at y=5, choose D -> turn15: y=4.\nTurn15: at y=4, choose S -> turn16: y=4.\nTurn16: at y=4, choose U -> turn17: y=5.\n\nBut we can at turn15 choose U? Then we go to y=5 at turn16 (τ=9) -> unsafe. So we must choose S at turn15.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, write the answer.\n\nAnswer Format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nt_1=7.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 7: D\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: D\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\n\nBut we have 14 actions? From turn7 to turn20: 14 turns? But we started at turn7 and ended at turn20? Then the last action at turn20: U moves us to y=9 at turn21.\n\nBut the problem says: we start at turn t1 (7) and we provide actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1? Then H is the number of actions? And we end at turn t1+H? \n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at the end of the sequence? \n\nAfter the last action (at turn20), at turn21 we are at y=9.\n\nSo the minimal H is 14? \n\nBut the problem: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that we reach (0,9) at turn t1+H? \n\nYes: after H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1), the state at turn t1+H is (0,9).\n\nSo H=14.\n\nWe provide the 14 actions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: D\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: D\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the last action is at turn20? And we started at turn7. That's 14 actions: turns 7,8,...,20.\n\nAnd at turn21 (which is 7+14) we are at y=9.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut let me verify the freeway at the critical points.\n\nAt turn14 (t=14): we are at y=5? \n  How many turns from t1=7? t=14 is t1+7? Because 14-7=7? \n  So τ=7.\n  We are at y=5: freeway5 at τ=7: \n      car1: [25,36] -> safe.\n      car2: [61,72] -> safe.\n      car3: [-17,-6] -> safe.\n  Then we choose D: so we move to y=4 at turn15.\n\nAt turn15 (t=15, τ=8): we are at y=4: freeway4 at τ=8: \n      car1: [31,42] -> safe.\n      car2: [79,90] -> safe.\n  Then we choose S: so at turn16 we are still at y=4.\n\nAt turn16 (t=16, τ=9): we are at y=4: freeway4 at τ=9: \n      car1: [37,48] -> safe.\n      car2: [85,96] -> safe.\n  Then we choose U: to y=5 at turn17.\n\nAt turn17 (t=17, τ=10): we are at y=5: freeway5 at τ=10:\n      car1: [43,54] -> safe.\n      car2: [79,90] -> safe.\n      car3: [1,12] -> safe.\n  Then U to y=6 at turn18.\n\nAt turn18 (t=18, τ=11): y=6: freeway6 at τ=11:\n      car1: [49,60] -> safe.\n      car2: [85,96] -> safe.\n      car3: [7,18] -> safe.\n  Then U to y=7 at turn19.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is correct.\n\nNote: we used S at turn8 and turn15. We could use D at turn8? Because at y=0, D also stays at 0. Similarly, at turn15 we are at y=4: if we choose D, we go to y=3? Then we would have to come back, which is worse. So we must choose S at turn15? Because we want to stay at y=4.\n\nAt turn8: we are at y=0. We can choose S or D: both result in staying at 0. So we can write D? But S is clearer. The problem allows either.\n\nBut in the answer, we can choose S for consistency.\n\nSimilarly, at turn15: we are at y=4. We must stay, so we choose S.\n\nTherefore, the final answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H = 14\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) starting from \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), is achieved with the following sequence of actions:\n\n- At turn 7, move down (D) to avoid collision on freeway 1 at turn 8 and reach y=0.\n- At turn 8, stay (S) to remain at y=0 (no freeway, safe) and allow time for cars to pass.\n- At turn 9, move up (U) to return to y=1 (freeway 1 safe at τ=3).\n- From turns 10 to 13, move up (U) consecutively to progress to y=5, as freeways 1 to 5 are safe at the respective τ values.\n- At turn 14, move down (D) to avoid collision on freeway 6 at turn 15 and reach y=4.\n- At turn 15, stay (S) to remain at y=4 (freeway 4 safe at τ=9) and allow time for cars on freeway 5 to clear.\n- From turns 16 to 20, move up (U) consecutively to reach y=9 at turn 21, as freeways 4 to 8 are safe at the respective τ values.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and minimizes the number of turns.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 17: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 18: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 19: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 20: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 8, and I'm at y=0. The goal is y=9.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. All cars are moving right with speed 6. For each car, the span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). Since they're moving right, the head is to the right, and tail to the left, I think. Let me confirm the notation.\n\nFrom the car update rules:\n\nFor right-moving cars: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] meaning from tail to head, so tail is left, head is right. Then at time T, it becomes [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)].\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it says (0, -11, right, 6). So head is 0, tail is -11? But according to the update, for right-moving, Span should be [tail, head] = [-11, 0] at t₁.\n\nSimilarly, (48, 37, right, 6) would be [37, 48]? I'm confused.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nThe car state is given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nThen for update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] where ΔT = T - t₁\n\nRight-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, Span(t₁) is [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end.\n\nBut in the input, for freeway 1, it says (0, -11, right, 6). So here, head h=0, tail τ=-11, direction right.\n\nSo for right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nSimilarly, the other car (48, 37, right, 6), so Span(t₁) = [37, 48]? Head is 48, tail is 37, so [τ, h] = [37, 48], yes.\n\nBut τ is tail, which is left, h is head, right.\n\nIn the first one, (0, -11, right, 6), head h=0, tail τ=-11, so [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt time T, it becomes [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-11 + 6ΔT, 0 + 6ΔT]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if the player is at y_T, and for the car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at time T. Meaning the car covers position x=0 at time T.\n\nThe player is at (0, y_T), and collision if for the car on freeway y_T, 0 ∈ Span(T).\n\nAlso, important: when you move to a new row, you are not on that row until the next turn. Specifically: if at turn T you are at y_T, and you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, you are still on y_T, so you can be hit by cars on y_T only. At turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} yet, so cars on y_{T+1} don't affect you at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, when you arrive at a row, it's at the next turn.\n\nNow, I start at t₁=8, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 might be safe zones, no cars.\n\nThe problem says: avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8. So y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision possible there.\n\nAlso, the player can be at y=0 to y=9, inclusive.\n\nAt turn T, position is y_T, and we check for collision on freeway y_T if y_T between 1 and 8.\n\nIf y_T =0 or 9, no cars, so no collision.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H. Since I start at y=0 and need to reach y=9, the minimum possible H is 9, if I go up every turn. But I have to avoid cars on the rows in between.\n\ny from 0 to 9, difference of 9, so with only up moves, it would take 9 turns: from t=8 to t=16, y from 0 to 9 at t=17? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nAt turn t, I take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo sequence: at turn t, I am at y_t, I choose a_t, then I move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nI start at turn t₁=8, y_{8} = 0.\n\nI need to reach y_{t} = 9 for some t.\n\nLet t = t₁ + H, but H is the number of actions, so after H actions, I am at y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nSet t=0 as current turn for simplicity, but t₁ is given, so I'll use absolute turns.\n\nCurrent turn: t=8, y=0.\n\nAfter one action, at turn t=9, y=y_9.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=8+H, y= y_{8+H} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from 8 to 8+H-1, so H actions, from a_8 to a_{8+H-1}, and at turn 8+H, I am at y=9.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nCollision at turn T if y_T between 1 and 8, and for the car on that row, 0 in span at time T.\n\nNow, for each freeway, there are multiple cars, but I need to avoid all of them.\n\nList the cars for each row.\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8.\n\nFor each, the cars are given.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: two cars: (head, tail, dir, speed) = (0, -11, right, 6) and (48, 37, right, 6)\n\nSince both right-moving, and span at t=8.\n\nFor first car: span at t=8: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nSecond car: [37, 48]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? From table:\n\nFreeway 1: (0,-11,right,6), (48,37,right,6)\n\nFreeway 2: same: (0,-11,right,6), (48,37,right,6)\n\nFreeway 3: same\n\nFreeway 4: same\n\nFreeway 5: (0,-11,right,6), (36,25,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5? (0,-11,right,6), (36,25,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nSo rows 1-4 have two cars each: one near x=0 and one around x=40.\n\nRows 5-8 have three cars: one near x=0, one around x=30-40, and one negative, like x=-50.\n\nNow, all cars move right at speed 6 per turn.\n\nSince they move right, the span shifts right over time.\n\nCollision on freeway k at time T if player is at y_T = k, and 0 is in some car's span on that row at time T.\n\nFor each row and time, I need to know if position x=0 is covered by a car.\n\nSince the player must be at x=0, and we care about whether x=0 is occupied at that time.\n\nFor each freeway, find when x=0 is not covered by any car.\n\nThat is, for each row, find times T when no car has 0 in its span at T.\n\nThen I can be on that row at those times.\n\nNow, let's define the time from current t=8.\n\nSet τ = T - t₁ = T - 8, so τ=0 is now.\n\nThen for each car, at time τ, span is shifted.\n\nFor a car with initial span [L, R] at τ=0, since moving right, at time τ, span is [L + 6τ, R + 6τ] for right-moving cars.\n\nIn terms of the left and right ends.\n\nFor a right-moving car, at τ=0 (t=8), span [left, right] = [τ, h] for given (h,τ).\n\nIn input, for a car, it's (head, tail, dir, speed).\n\nFor right-moving, head is right, tail is left, so left end = tail, right end = head.\n\nSo at τ=0, left = τ, right = h.\n\nThen at time τ, left = τ + 6τ? Speed s=6, so position increases.\n\nΔτ = τ, so left(τ) = left(0) + 6τ\n\nright(τ) = right(0) + 6τ\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving, so only right.\n\nNow for each row, cars:\n\nFirst, row 1:\n\nCar A: at τ=0, left = -11, right = 0\n\nCar B: left = 37, right = 48\n\nAt time τ, car A: left = -11 + 6τ, right = 0 + 6τ\n\nCar B: left = 37 + 6τ, right = 48 + 6τ\n\nx=0 is covered if for car A, left <= 0 <= right, or for car B, left <= 0 <= right.\n\nFor car A: -11 + 6τ <= 0 <= 6τ\n\nSince 0 <= 6τ always for τ >=0, so only need -11 + 6τ <= 0, so 6τ <= 11, τ <= 11/6 ≈ 1.833, so for τ <= 1, it is covered? Let's see:\n\n-11 + 6τ <= 0 implies τ <= 11/6 ≈ 1.833, and since 0 <= 6τ always true for τ>=0.\n\nBut τ is integer? Turns are discrete, so τ integer.\n\nτ = T - t₁, T turn number, so integer.\n\nSo for car A, x=0 covered when -11 + 6τ <= 0 and 0 <= 6τ.\n\n0 <= 6τ always for τ >=0.\n\n-11 + 6τ <= 0 when 6τ <= 11, τ <= 11/6 ≈1.833, so for τ=0,1\n\nAt τ=0: left = -11, right=0, so -11 <= 0 <=0, yes 0 covered.\n\nAt τ=1: left = -11+6= -5, right=0+6=6, so -5 <=0<=6, yes.\n\nAt τ=2: left= -11+12=1, right=0+12=12, 1 <=0<=12? 1<=0 false, so 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly, car B: left=37+6τ, right=48+6τ, both positive and >0 for τ>=0, so left >=37 >0, so 0 not covered by car B ever.\n\nSo for row 1, x=0 covered only by car A at τ=0 and τ=1.\n\nSo at times τ=0 and τ=1, x=0 occupied.\n\nAt τ=2, not occupied, since car A left=1>0, car B left=37>0.\n\nτ=2: car A left= -11+12=1, right=12, so [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nCar B [43,54], not.\n\nSo for row 1, occupied at τ=0,1; free at τ=2,3,... for x=0.\n\nNow row 2: same as row 1, because cars identical: (0,-11,right,6) and (48,37,right,6)\n\nSimilarly, row 3: same\n\nRow 4: same\n\nSo rows 1-4: x=0 occupied at τ=0 and τ=1; free for τ>=2.\n\nNow row 5: cars: (0,-11,right,6), (36,25,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nFirst car: same as before, (head=0, tail=-11, right,6), so left=-11, right=0 at τ=0.\n\nx=0 covered at τ=0,1 (as above)\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,6), head=36, tail=25, so left=25, right=36 at τ=0.\n\nAt time τ, left=25+6τ, right=36+6τ, both >=25>0, so never covers x=0.\n\nThird car: (-42,-53,right,6), head=-42, tail=-53? Head h=-42, tail τ=-53.\n\nSince right-moving, span at τ=0: [τ, h] = [-53, -42]\n\nLeft = tail = -53, right = head = -42.\n\nAt time τ, left = -53 + 6τ, right = -42 + 6τ\n\nx=0 covered if left <=0 <= right.\n\n-53 + 6τ <= 0 <= -42 + 6τ\n\nFirst, 0 <= -42 + 6τ ⇒ 6τ >=42 ⇒ τ >=7\n\nSecond, -53 + 6τ <=0 ⇒ 6τ <=53 ⇒ τ <= 53/6 ≈8.833, so τ <=8\n\nSince τ integer, τ from 7 to 8 inclusive.\n\nNow, for row 5, x=0 covered by:\n\n- First car at τ=0,1\n\n- Third car at τ=7,8\n\n- Second car never\n\nSo covered at τ=0,1,7,8\n\nFree at τ=2,3,4,5,6 and τ>=9\n\nτ=2 to6 and τ>=9.\n\nSimilarly, row 6: same cars as row 5, so same: covered τ=0,1,7,8; free τ=2-6,9,...\n\nRow 7: same\n\nRow 8: same\n\nSo summary for each row, times τ when x=0 is occupied (collision if on that row at τ):\n\nRow 1: occ τ=0,1\n\nRow 2: occ τ=0,1\n\nRow 3: occ τ=0,1\n\nRow 4: occ τ=0,1\n\nRow 5: occ τ=0,1,7,8\n\nRow 6: occ τ=0,1,7,8\n\nRow 7: occ τ=0,1,7,8\n\nRow 8: occ τ=0,1,7,8\n\nNow, τ=0 is current time, t=8.\n\nPlayer starts at τ=0, y=0, which is safe, no freeway.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some future turn.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe path: I need to go through rows 1 to 8, but I can stay or move up/down, but since I need to go up, probably best to go up directly.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on a row when it is occupied.\n\nAlso, when I move, I change row at the next turn.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, and I choose action a_T, which sets y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy = +1 (U), -1 (D), or 0 (S).\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am at y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision at turn T only if y_T between 1 and 8 and x=0 occupied at time T.\n\nIf I am at y_T and I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, I am on y_T, so I need y_T not occupied at time T.\n\nAt turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, need that not occupied at time T+1.\n\nIf I stay, same row.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, I want to go up as fast as possible, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid occupied times.\n\nFirst, let's list the occupied times for each row in terms of τ.\n\nτ = T - 8\n\nFor row k, occ τ: as above.\n\nI start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some τ.\n\nSince y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 moves up, so minimum τ=9 if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I might have to wait or something.\n\nLet me denote the state.\n\nI need to be at row 1 at some τ where it is free, similarly for others.\n\nBut I have to move sequentially.\n\nSince I can move up or down, but to go to 9, down might not help, but I could go down to avoid a row, but since rows below might have issues, but in this case, row 1-4 are only occupied at τ=0,1, which are past or current, but τ=0 is now, and I'm at y=0, so for row 1, at τ=0, it is occupied, but I'm not on it.\n\nAt τ=0, I am at y=0, which is safe.\n\nNow, I need to enter the rows.\n\nLet me think about when I can be on each row safely.\n\nFor row 1: must not be at τ=0 or τ=1, but τ=0 is now, and I can be on row 1 only at future times.\n\nAt τ=0, I am at y=0.\n\nI can take action at τ=0 (turn t=8) to go to y=1 or stay or down, but down to y=-1? y must be in [0,9], so y_{t+1} in [0,9], so from y=0, I can go to y=1 (U), or stay y=0 (S), or down? D would be y=0 + (-1) = -1, but y must be >=0, so I cannot go below 0, I think.\n\ny_{t+1} in [0,9], so from y=0, D is invalid? Or is it clamped?\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} in [0,9]\n\nSo if y_t=0 and a_t=D, then y_{t+1} = -1, but since it must be in [0,9], probably it is set to 0, or invalid? But the problem says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so I think it is clamped to 0.\n\nSimilarly for y=9, U would be 10, clamped to 9.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nIn the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if out of bound, it stays, I think.\n\nFor example, from y=0, if D, y_{t+1} = max(0, min(9, y_t + Δy)) or something.\n\nBut in this case, since we start at 0 and go to 9, and rows 1-8 have issues, probably we don't go down, but we might stay.\n\nBut from y=0, if I do D, I might stay at 0.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, U stays.\n\nBut to save time, probably no down moves.\n\nNow back to row 1.\n\nRow 1 is occupied at τ=0 and τ=1.\n\nτ=0 is now, t=8.\n\nAt τ=0, I am at y=0.\n\nI can move to row 1 at τ=1 by taking U at τ=0.\n\nThat is, at turn t=8, action U, then at turn t=9 (τ=1), I am at y=1.\n\nBut at τ=1, row 1 is occupied! So if I am at y=1 at τ=1, collision.\n\nIf I take S at τ=0, I stay at y=0 at τ=1 (turn t=9).\n\nThen at τ=1, I am at y=0.\n\nNow, row 1 is free only for τ >=2.\n\nSo I can only enter row 1 at τ=2 or later.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nFirst, let's list for each row, the safe times to be on it, i.e., times when not occupied.\n\nFor row 1: safe for τ >=2\n\nSimilarly row 2: same, safe τ >=2\n\nRow 3: safe τ >=2\n\nRow 4: safe τ >=2\n\nRow 5: occupied τ=0,1,7,8 so safe for τ=2,3,4,5,6 and τ>=9\n\nSimilarly row 6: same, safe τ=2-6,9,10,...\n\nRow 7: same\n\nRow 8: same\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nI start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some τ.\n\nThe position changes only when I move up.\n\nEach up move increases y by 1.\n\nI must pass through each row 1 to 8, but I can stay or move down, but that might increase time.\n\nSince all rows above have constraints, I need to plan the timing.\n\nI need to be on row k at some safe time τ_k.\n\nThen the sequence must have τ increasing.\n\nMoreover, when I move from row k to k+1, it takes one turn: at turn τ, I am at row k, I take U, then at τ+1, I am at row k+1.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay, τ increases without moving.\n\nTo minimize time, I want to move up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid being on a row when occupied.\n\nNow, let's consider the critical points.\n\nFirst, for rows 1-4, I can be on them only from τ=2 onwards.\n\nRow 5-8 have a window τ=2-6 safe, but occupied at τ=7,8.\n\nτ=7 and 8 are occupied for rows 5-8.\n\nI need to be past row 8 before τ=7 if possible.\n\nBut I start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nSuppose I wait at y=0 until I can enter.\n\nAt τ=0, I am at y=0.\n\nIf I take S, I stay at y=0 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, I can take S again, stay at y=0, or take U to go to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nSince row 1 is safe at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo save time, I should move as soon as possible.\n\nEarliest I can enter row 1 is at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, I can be at row 1.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nNow, for row 1 at τ=2, safe.\n\nThen I can go to row 2 at τ=3, since row 2 safe at τ=3 >=2.\n\nSimilarly, to row 3 at τ=4, row 4 at τ=5.\n\nNow, row 4 safe at τ=5 >=2.\n\nThen from row 4, I go to row 5 at τ=6.\n\nNow, row 5: safe at τ=2,3,4,5,6, but not at 7,8.\n\nAt τ=6, row 5 is safe? τ=6 is in 2-6, yes safe.\n\nBut at τ=6, I am at row 5.\n\nThen I need to go to row 6.\n\nIf I take U at τ=6, I go to row 6 at τ=7.\n\nBut row 6 at τ=7 is occupied! Because rows 5-8 occupied at τ=7,8.\n\nSo if I go to row 6 at τ=7, collision.\n\nI could stay on row 5 at τ=6, but if I stay, at τ=7, I am still on row 5, but row 5 occupied at τ=7, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt τ=6, on row 5, if I stay, at τ=7, row 5 occupied.\n\nIf I go up, to row 6 at τ=7, occupied.\n\nIf I go down, to row 4 at τ=7.\n\nBut row 4: for row 4, it is safe only for τ>=2, and at τ=7, row 4 is safe, since no occupation for τ>=2.\n\nRow 4 occupied only at τ=0,1, so for τ>=2, always safe.\n\nSimilarly rows 1-4.\n\nSo at τ=6, on row 5, I could go down to row 4 at τ=7.\n\nThen at τ=7, I am on row 4, which is safe.\n\nBut then I need to go back up later.\n\nBut time increases.\n\nFrom row 4 at τ=7, I can go to row 5, but row 5 at τ=8: occupied, since τ=8 for row 5 is occupied.\n\nτ=8 is occupied for row 5.\n\nLet's see the safe times.\n\nI need to be on row 5 only when τ=2,3,4,5,6 or τ>=9.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAt τ=6, I am on row 5.\n\nIf I stay or go up, at τ=7 I will be on row 5 or 6, both occupied at τ=7.\n\nOnly option is to go down to row 4 at τ=7.\n\nThen at τ=7, I am on row 4, safe.\n\nNow at τ=7, I can choose: stay on row 4, or go to row 3 or row 5.\n\nBut row 5 at τ=8 is occupied, so I cannot go to row 5 at τ=8.\n\nIf I take U to row 5 at τ=8, occupied.\n\nIf I stay on row 4, safe, but not progressing.\n\nGo down to row 3, but that might be worse.\n\nThen I need to wait until τ=9 to go to row 5.\n\nAt τ=7, on row 4.\n\nI can stay at row 4 for a while.\n\nBut to go up, I need to go to row 5 at a safe time.\n\nRow 5 safe at τ>=9 or τ=2-6.\n\nBut τ=7,8 are bad, so next safe is τ=9.\n\nSimilarly for rows 6-8.\n\nSo I should go to row 5 at τ=9.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nFirst, from start: I need to enter row 1 at τ=2.\n\nSo at τ=0, y=0.\n\nI take S or something to wait.\n\nAt τ=0 (t=8), I can take S, so at τ=1 (t=9), y=0.\n\nThen at τ=1, I take U, so at τ=2 (t=10), y=1.\n\nSince I take action at τ=1 to go to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=1, row 1 safe.\n\nThen I can go up each turn.\n\nAt τ=2, y=1, take U, so at τ=3, y=2.\n\nRow 2 safe at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, take U, at τ=4, y=3, row 3 safe.\n\nAt τ=4, take U, at τ=5, y=4, row 4 safe.\n\nAt τ=5, y=4, take U, so at τ=6, y=5, row 5 safe (since τ=6).\n\nNow at τ=6, y=5, I need to choose action.\n\nIf I take U, at τ=7, y=6, but row 6 occupied at τ=7.\n\nIf I take D, at τ=7, y=4.\n\nIf I take S, at τ=7, y=5, occupied.\n\nSo only safe is to take D to y=4 at τ=7.\n\nAt τ=6, take D, so at τ=7, y=4.\n\ny=4 is row 4, safe.\n\nNow at τ=7, y=4.\n\nI need to go up, but row 5 at τ=8 is occupied, so I cannot go to row 5 now.\n\nI can stay at y=4.\n\nAt τ=7, take S, so at τ=8, y=4.\n\nStill safe.\n\nThen at τ=8, y=4, I can take action.\n\nτ=8, row 5 occupied, so I cannot go to row 5 at τ=9? At τ=8, I am at y=4.\n\nIf I take U, at τ=9, y=5.\n\nNow, row 5 at τ=9: is it safe?\n\nFor row 5, safe at τ=2-6 and τ>=9.\n\nτ=9 >=9, yes safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=5 at τ=9, safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nBut rows 6-8 are occupied at τ=7,8, but at τ=9, they are safe, since τ>=9 safe.\n\nSo let's continue.\n\nAt τ=8, y=4, I take U, so at τ=9, y=5, row 5 safe.\n\nThen at τ=9, y=5, take U, so at τ=10, y=6, row 6 at τ=10 >=9, safe.\n\nAt τ=10, y=6, take U, at τ=11, y=7, row 7 safe.\n\nAt τ=11, take U, at τ=12, y=8, row 8 safe.\n\nAt τ=12, take U, at τ=13, y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, I reached y=9 at τ=13.\n\nτ = T - 8, so at T=8+13=21, y=9.\n\nNow, number of actions: from τ=0 to τ=12, I take actions at τ=0 to τ=12, 13 actions? Let's list the actions.\n\nτ is time index, actions at each turn.\n\nStart: turn t=8, τ=0, position y=0.\n\nAction a_8: I need to wait until τ=2 to enter row 1.\n\nAt τ=0, I take S (stay), so at t=9, τ=1, y=0.\n\nThen at τ=1, take U, so at t=10, τ=2, y=1.\n\nThen at τ=2, take U, to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nAction at τ=2 (t=10) U, position at τ=3 (t=11) y=2.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nAt τ=3 (t=11), take U, to y=3 at τ=4 (t=12)\n\nAt τ=4 (t=12), take U, to y=4 at τ=5 (t=13)\n\nAt τ=5 (t=13), take U, to y=5 at τ=6 (t=14)\n\nNow at τ=6 (t=14), y=5, I need to take D to go to y=4 at next.\n\nAction: take D, so at τ=7 (t=15), y=4.\n\nThen at τ=7 (t=15), y=4, take S (stay), so at τ=8 (t=16), y=4.\n\nThen at τ=8 (t=16), take U, to y=5 at τ=9 (t=17)\n\nAt τ=9 (t=17), y=5, take U, to y=6 at τ=10 (t=18)\n\nAt τ=10 (t=18), take U, to y=7 at τ=11 (t=19)\n\nAt τ=11 (t=19), take U, to y=8 at τ=12 (t=20)\n\nAt τ=12 (t=20), take U, to y=9 at τ=13 (t=21)\n\nNow, at τ=13, y=9, reached.\n\nActions from t=8 to t=20, that's 13 actions? t from 8 to 20 inclusive: 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20: that's 13 turns, actions at each.\n\nH=13, since actions at t=8 to t=20, and at t=21, y=9.\n\nt=8+H, H actions, position at t=8+H.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 8+H.\n\nHere, after 13 actions, at turn 8+13=21, y=9.\n\nBut is this minimal? Probably not, because I had to go down and wait.\n\nPerhaps I can enter later or earlier.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 5-8 are safe at τ=2-6, I could go faster through them before τ=7.\n\nBut I need to enter row 1 at τ=2.\n\nThen go up to row 4 at τ=5.\n\nThen to row 5 at τ=6.\n\nBut then at τ=6 on row 5, I have to go down as before.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly from row 4 to row 5 earlier.\n\nI entered row 5 at τ=6, which is the last safe time before τ=7,8 bad.\n\nBut I cannot stay or go up from there.\n\nPerhaps I can delay entering so that I reach row 5 later, after τ=8.\n\nFor example, stay at y=0 longer.\n\nBut that might take more time.\n\nStart: at τ=0, y=0.\n\nI can take multiple S to wait.\n\nFor example, suppose I take S at τ=0, to y=0 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, take S again, to y=0 at τ=2.\n\nBut at τ=2, I could enter row 1.\n\nIf I stay at y=0 longer, say until τ=5 or something.\n\nThen enter row 1 at τ=5.\n\nBut row 1 is safe from τ=2 on, so entering later might not help.\n\nThen at τ=5, y=1.\n\nThen go up: at τ=6, y=2; τ=7, y=3; but at τ=7, row 3: row 3 is safe for τ>=2, so at τ=7, y=3 is safe.\n\nThen τ=8, y=4, safe.\n\nThen τ=9, y=5, row 5 safe at τ=9.\n\nThen τ=10, y=6; τ=11, y=7; τ=12, y=8; τ=13, y=9.\n\nBut I started moving later.\n\nAt τ=0: take S, to τ=1 y=0\n\nτ=1: take S, to τ=2 y=0? No.\n\nAt τ=0 (t=8), take S, to τ=1 (t=9) y=0\n\nAt τ=1 (t=9), take S, to τ=2 (t=10) y=0\n\nAt τ=2 (t=10), take U, to τ=3 (t=11) y=1\n\nThen at τ=3 (t=11), take U, to τ=4 (t=12) y=2\n\nτ=4 (t=12), U to τ=5 (t=13) y=3\n\nτ=5 (t=13), U to τ=6 (t=14) y=4\n\nτ=6 (t=14), U to τ=7 (t=15) y=5? But row 5 at τ=7 occupied! Cannot.\n\nAt τ=6, if I go to y=5, but row 5 at τ=7? At τ=6, action U, to y=5 at τ=7.\n\nτ=7, row 5 occupied, collision.\n\nIf at τ=6 (y=4), I take S, to y=4 at τ=7.\n\nThen at τ=7 (y=4), I can take U to y=5 at τ=8, but τ=8 row 5 occupied.\n\nStill bad.\n\nSo I need to be on row 5 only at safe times.\n\nIn this sequence, at τ=6, y=4, I should not go to y=5 until τ=9.\n\nSo I need to wait at y=4 or something.\n\nBack to the first sequence, which seems necessary to go down at some point.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster through the first rows.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 1-4 are safe after τ=2, I can go through them quickly.\n\nBut I have to start from τ=0.\n\nEarliest to enter row 1 is τ=2.\n\nThen row 2 at τ=3, row 3 at τ=4, row 4 at τ=5.\n\nThen row 5: I can go at τ=5 or τ=6 or later.\n\nIf I go to row 5 at τ=6, then stuck, have to go down.\n\nIf I go to row 5 earlier, but row 5 safe from τ=2.\n\nAt τ=5, I am on row 4.\n\nI can go to row 5 at τ=6? From row 4 at τ=5, take U to y=5 at τ=6.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt τ=4, I am on row 3.\n\nI could go directly to row 5? No, I can only move to adjacent rows or stay.\n\ny changes by at most 1 per turn.\n\nSo I must go through each row.\n\nUnless I skip, but no, y changes by 0 or ±1, so I must visit each integer y between start and end if I go directly.\n\nBut I can go down temporarily.\n\nIn the first sequence, I reached in 13 actions.\n\nBut let's see if I can avoid going down.\n\nPerhaps I can enter row 1 later, so that when I reach row 5, it is after τ=8.\n\nFor example, stay at y=0 until τ=7 or something.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0.\n\nTake S at τ=0, to y=0 τ=1\n\nTake S at τ=1, to y=0 τ=2\n\n...\n\nHow long to stay.\n\nSuppose I stay at y=0 until τ=8.\n\nBut at τ=8, I am at y=0.\n\nThen at τ=8, take U to y=1 at τ=9.\n\nBut row 1 at τ=9 is safe, since τ>=2.\n\nSimilarly, then go up each turn.\n\nAt τ=9, y=1\n\nTake U to y=2 at τ=10\n\nU to y=3 at τ=11\n\nU to y=4 at τ=12\n\nU to y=5 at τ=13\n\nNow row 5 at τ=13: τ=13 >=9, safe.\n\nU to y=6 at τ=14\n\nU to y=7 at τ=15\n\nU to y=8 at τ=16\n\nU to y=9 at τ=17\n\nNow, τ=17, y=9.\n\nBut I used many stay actions.\n\nActions: from τ=0 to τ=16, 17 actions? Let's count.\n\nAt τ=0 (t=8), take S to stay at y=0 until... I need to stay from τ=0 to τ=8, that is, at turns t=8 to t=15? τ from 0 to 8.\n\nτ = T - 8, so at τ=0 (t=8), position y=0\n\nAction: to stay at same position for multiple turns.\n\nAt turn t=8 (τ=0), take S, so at t=9 (τ=1), y=0\n\nAt t=9 (τ=1), take S, at t=10 (τ=2), y=0\n\n...\n\nI need to be at y=0 from τ=0 to τ=8, that means actions from t=8 to t=15: at each, take S, so position remains y=0 at t=9 to t=16? Let's see:\n\nAfter action at t, position at t+1.\n\nAt t=8 (τ=0), take S, position at t=9 (τ=1) y=0\n\nAt t=9 (τ=1), take S, position at t=10 (τ=2) y=0\n\n...\n\nAt t=15 (τ=7), take S, position at t=16 (τ=8) y=0\n\nNow at t=16 (τ=8), I am at y=0.\n\nThen take U, so at t=17 (τ=9), y=1\n\nThen at t=17 (τ=9), take U, at t=18 (τ=10), y=2\n\nt=18 (τ=10), U, t=19 (τ=11), y=3\n\nt=19 (τ=11), U, t=20 (τ=12), y=4\n\nt=20 (τ=12), U, t=21 (τ=13), y=5\n\nt=21 (τ=13), U, t=22 (τ=14), y=6\n\nt=22 (τ=14), U, t=23 (τ=15), y=7\n\nt=23 (τ=15), U, t=24 (τ=16), y=8\n\nt=24 (τ=16), U, t=25 (τ=17), y=9\n\nSo reached at t=25, which is τ=17, after 17 actions from t=8 to t=24? Actions at t=8 to t=24, that's 17 actions, position at t=25.\n\nWorse than before, 17 vs 13.\n\nNot better.\n\nIn the first sequence, I had H=13.\n\nBut perhaps I can save time by not going down.\n\nFor example, at τ=5, I am at y=4 (from earlier sequence).\n\nInstead of going to y=5 at τ=6, I could stay at y=4 for a while.\n\nAt τ=5, y=4, take S, so at τ=6, y=4.\n\nThen at τ=6, y=4, I can take S again or something.\n\nBut I need to go to row 5 at safe time.\n\nNext safe for row 5 is τ=9.\n\nSo I need to be at row 4 until I can go up.\n\nAt τ=6, y=4, take S, to y=4 at τ=7.\n\nAt τ=7, y=4, take S, to y=4 at τ=8.\n\nAt τ=8, y=4, take U, to y=5 at τ=9.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut let's see the sequence from beginning.\n\nStart: τ=0 (t=8), y=0, take S? To delay.\n\nTo enter row 1 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=0 (t=8), take S, to τ=1 (t=9) y=0\n\nAt τ=1 (t=9), take U? If I take U at τ=1, to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nAs before.\n\nAt τ=1, if I take S, I stay at y=0 at τ=2, but I can enter at τ=2.\n\nBut entering at τ=2 is fine.\n\nNow from there:\n\nτ=2 (t=10), y=1, take U, to τ=3 (t=11) y=2\n\nτ=3 (t=11), U, to τ=4 (t=12) y=3\n\nτ=4 (t=12), U, to τ=5 (t=13) y=4\n\nNow at τ=5 (t=13), y=4, instead of going up, I take S, to y=4 at τ=6 (t=14)\n\nAt τ=6 (t=14), y=4, take S, to y=4 at τ=7 (t=15)\n\nAt τ=7 (t=15), y=4, take S, to y=4 at τ=8 (t=16)\n\nAt τ=8 (t=16), y=4, take U, to y=5 at τ=9 (t=17)\n\nThen τ=9 (t=17), y=5, U to y=6 τ=10 (t=18)\n\nτ=10 (t=18), U to y=7 τ=11 (t=19)\n\nτ=11 (t=19), U to y=8 τ=12 (t=20)\n\nτ=12 (t=20), U to y=9 τ=13 (t=21)\n\nSame as first sequence, 13 actions.\n\nIn the first sequence I had a down move, but same number of turns.\n\nIn first sequence: actions from t=8 to t=20, 13 actions.\n\nHere also from t=8 to t=20: t=8 to t=20 inclusive is 13 turns.\n\nt=8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20: 13 actions, position at t=21 y=9.\n\nIn the sequence with down: at t=14 (τ=6), I took D to go to y=4 at t=15.\n\nIn this sequence, I took S at t=13,14,15 to stay at y=4.\n\nSame number of actions.\n\nBut in the down sequence, I had to go down and up again, but since I went down at τ=6 and back at τ=9, it cost extra, but in the stay sequence, I stayed at y=4 for three turns.\n\nSame H.\n\nCan I reach faster?\n\nSuppose I can go to row 5 earlier.\n\nFor example, enter row 1 at τ=2.\n\nThen go to row 2 at τ=3, row 3 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=3.\n\nI could go to row 4 at τ=5, but row 4 is fine.\n\nBut to go to row 5, I can at τ=5? From y=3 at τ=4, take U to y=4 at τ=5.\n\nThen from y=4 at τ=5, take U to y=5 at τ=6.\n\nSame as before.\n\nI can only move one row per turn.\n\nSo I think 13 is the minimum, with either going down or staying.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have to spend time waiting between row 4 and row 5.\n\nNow, back to the answer.\n\nIn the first sequence I had:\n\nActions:\n\nt=8 (τ=0): S (stay at y=0)\n\nt=9 (τ=1): U (to y=1 at t=10)\n\nt=10 (τ=2): U (to y=2 at t=11)\n\nt=11 (τ=3): U (to y=3 at t=12)\n\nt=12 (τ=4): U (to y=4 at t=13)\n\nt=13 (τ=5): U (to y=5 at t=14)\n\nt=14 (τ=6): D (down to y=4 at t=15)  // since going up or stay dangerous\n\nt=15 (τ=7): S (stay at y=4)\n\nt=16 (τ=8): U (to y=5 at t=17)\n\nt=17 (τ=9): U (to y=6 at t=18)\n\nt=18 (τ=10): U (to y=7 at t=19)\n\nt=19 (τ=11): U (to y=8 at t=20)\n\nt=20 (τ=12): U (to y=9 at t=21)\n\nIn this, at t=15 (τ=7), I took S, but I could take U directly? But row 5 at τ=8 occupied, so no.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=15 (τ=7), I am at y=4, I took S to stay at y=4 at t=16.\n\nBut at τ=7, y=4 is safe.\n\nThen at t=16 (τ=8), take U to y=5 at t=17 (τ=9).\n\nBut at τ=8, row 5 occupied, but I am going to y=5 at τ=9, which is safe.\n\nIn the action list, I need to output actions for each turn.\n\nIn the sequence with only stay and up, no down:\n\nt=8: S  // y=0 to y=0 at t=9\n\nt=9: U  // y=0 to y=1 at t=10? At t=9, position y=0, take U, to y=1 at t=10.\n\nt=10: U  // to y=2 at t=11\n\nt=11: U  // to y=3 at t=12\n\nt=12: U  // to y=4 at t=13\n\nt=13: S  // stay at y=4 at t=14?

In down version: t=13: U to y=5 at t=14, then t=14: D to y=4 at t=15, then t=15: S to y=4 at t=16, then t=16: U to y=5 at t=17.\n\nCompared to no down: t=13: S to y=4 at t=14, t=14: S to y=4 at t=15, t=15: S to y=4 at t=16, t=16: U to y=5 at t=17.\n\nIn down, I used U, D, S; in no down, S,S,S,U.\n\nBut both from t=13 to t=16, I end at y=4 at t=16, and go to y=5 at t=17.\n\nIn down: at t=13: from y=4 take U to y=5 at t=14\n\nThen at t=14: from y=5 take D to y=4 at t=15\n\nThen at t=15: from y=4 take S to y=4 at t=16\n\nThen t=16: U to y=5 at t=17\n\nIn terms of position: at t=14: y=5, which is occupied? At t=14, τ=6, y=5, row 5 at τ=6 is safe, yes.\n\nBut at τ=6, row 5 safe, so I can be there.\n\nThen at t=15 (τ=7), if I stay, y=5, but row 5 occupied at τ=7, collision.\n\nSo I must not stay or go up; I must go down.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=14 (τ=6), after reaching y=5, I take D to go to y=4 at t=15 (τ=7).\n\nThen at t=15 (τ=7), I am at y=4, safe.\n\nThen I can take S or U later.\n\nIn the no down sequence, I didn't go to y=5 at τ=6, I stayed at y=4.\n\nBut in both cases, I have the same number of actions to reach.\n\nNow, to have minimal H, 13 seems necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach in less.\n\nSuppose I enter row 1 at τ=2, but then go slower or faster.\n\nFor example, at τ=2, y=1\n\nTake S at τ=2, stay at y=1 at τ=3.\n\nBut row 1 safe, but I waste time.\n\nThen I reach later.\n\nNot better.\n\nGo up to row 4 at τ=5, then instead of going to row 5, I stay at row 4 until τ=8, then go to row 5 at τ=9.\n\nBut from τ=5 to τ=8, that's three turns waiting at y=4.\n\nThen from y=4 at τ=8, take U to y=5 at τ=9.\n\nThen up to y=9 at τ=13, same as before.\n\nNo saving.\n\nPerhaps I can be on row 5 at τ=5 or earlier.\n\nBut to be on row 5 at τ=5, I need to be on row 4 at τ=4, and so on.\n\nEnter row 1 at τ=2, row 2 at τ=3, row 3 at τ=4, row 4 at τ=5, row 5 at τ=6 earliest.\n\nThen at τ=6 on row 5, I must leave immediately to row 4, since at τ=7 it will be occupied.\n\nBut going to row 4 at τ=7 is fine.\n\nThen I have to come back.\n\nSo I think 13 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the output, I need the action sequence from t=8 onwards.\n\nIn the sequence, I have two options, but with down or without, same actions except some.\n\nBut in the down version, I have a down move, which might be fine, but let's use the no down version to avoid unnecessary moves.\n\nNo down sequence:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t=8: S  // stay at y=0\n\nTurn t=9: U  // to y=1 at t=10\n\nTurn t=10: U  // to y=2 at t=11\n\nTurn t=11: U  // to y=3 at t=12\n\nTurn t=12: U  // to y=4 at t=13\n\nNow at t=13 (τ=5), y=4, I take S to stay\n\nTurn t=13: S  // to y=4 at t=14\n\nTurn t=14: S  // to y=4 at t=15? At t=14, position y=4, take S, to y=4 at t=15\n\nt=15: S? I need to stay until I can go up.\n\nAt t=13: S, so at t=14 y=4\n\nt=14: S, at t=15 y=4\n\nt=15: S, at t=16 y=4\n\nThen t=16: U, to y=5 at t=17\n\nt=17: U to y=6 at t=18\n\netc.\n\nBut at t=15, if I take S, to y=4 at t=16, which is τ=8.\n\nThen at t=16, take U to y=5 at t=17, τ=9.\n\nBut I can go at t=15 to y=5? At t=15 (τ=7), position y=4, if I take U, to y=5 at t=16 (τ=8), but row 5 at τ=8 occupied, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo I must not go to y=5 at τ=8.\n\nSo I need to stay at y=4 until t=16, take U at t=16 to y=5 at t=17 (τ=9).\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=8: S  // a_{t1} = S\n\nt=9: U  // a_{t1+1} = U\n\nt=10: U\n\nt=11: U\n\nt=12: U  // now at t=13, y=4\n\nt=13: S  // stay, at t=14 y=4\n\nt=14: S  // stay, at t=15 y=4\n\nt=15: S  // stay, at t=16 y=4\n\nt=16: U  // to y=5 at t=17\n\nt=17: U  // to y=6 at t=18\n\nt=18: U  // to y=7 at t=19\n\nt=19: U  // to y=8 at t=20\n\nt=20: U  // to y=9 at t=21\n\nActions from t=8 to t=20, 13 actions.\n\nt=8 to t=20 inclusive is 13 turns.\n\nNow, H=13.\n\nIn the down sequence, it was similar, but with a down and one less stay.\n\nBut same H.\n\nFor output, I'll use this one without down.\n\nNow, about the cars on row 5-8, I have the third car that covers at τ=7,8, but in the sequence, I avoided those times.\n\nNow, the answer format.\n\nSo the actions:\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nAfter turn 20 action, at turn 21, y=9.\n\nBut the sequence should be for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=8, H=13, so turns 8 to 8+12=20.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the sequence, at turn 13,14,15 I have S, which is fine.\n\nTo write the answer.\n\nBut let's confirm collision.\n\nFor example, at turn t=10, τ=2, y=1, row 1: free, ok.\n\nt=11, τ=3, y=2, row 2 free.\n\nt=12, τ=4, y=3, row 3 free.\n\nt=13, τ=5, y=4, row 4 free.\n\nt=14, τ=6, y=4, row 4 free.\n\nt=15, τ=7, y=4, row 4 free.\n\nt=16, τ=8, y=4, row 4 free.\n\nt=17, τ=9, y=5, row 5 free (τ=9>=9).\n\nt=18, τ=10, y=6, row 6 free.\n\netc.\n\nNo collision.\n\nIf I used the down sequence: at t=13: U to y=5 at t=14 (τ=6), row 5 free.\n\nThen at t=14: D to y=4 at t=15 (τ=7), y=4 safe.\n\nThen at t=15: S to y=4 at t=16, or U to y=5 but cannot, so S or D, but S is fine.\n\nThen t=16: U to y=5 at t=17.\n\nSame.\n\nBut in down sequence, I have an extra move to y=5 and back, which is unnecessary, so better to stay at y=4.\n\nSo I think the sequence is fine.\n\nNow, for the output.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn 9 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I'm given its head, tail, direction, and speed at turn t1=9. Since all cars are moving right with speed 6, I can compute their positions at any future turn T.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Also, when moving, you're only considered on the new row at the next turn, so you don't collide with cars on the destination row during the move turn.\n\nFirst, I need to model the car movements. Since all cars are moving right at speed 6, their positions shift right by 6 units per turn.\n\nFor a right-moving car, span at time t is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)] since at t1, it's [τ, h], and it moves right.\n\nIn the update rule: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right-moving, so only that.\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, player is at y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of some car at T.\n\nPlayer position at turn T is y_{t1 + t} for t from 0 to H-1, but since we start at t1, let's define time relative to t1.\n\nSet τ = T - t1, so τ is the number of turns after t1.\n\nAt time τ (meaning turn t1 + τ), player position is y_τ.\n\ny_τ = y_{t1 + τ}\n\nBut y starts at τ=0: y_0 = 0\n\nWe want y_H = 9 for some H.\n\nH is the number of turns, so after H actions, we have y_0 to y_H, with y_H = 9.\n\nActions are taken from τ=0 to τ=H-1, affecting y_1 to y_H.\n\nLet's clarify:\n\nAt turn t1 + τ for τ=0: we are at position (0, y_τ) with y_0 given.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + τ}, we move to y_{τ+1}.\n\nSo at the start of turn t1 + τ, we are at y_τ.\n\nAfter action, we go to y_{τ+1} at the start of next turn.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn when we are on a freeway.\n\nSpecifically, at turn T = t1 + τ, we are at y_τ, and if y_τ between 1 and 8, we check if for freeway k = y_τ, there is a car with 0 in its span at time T.\n\nSince T = t1 + τ, and τ = T - t1.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to know when there is a car covering position x=0 at time τ.\n\nx=0 is the player's x-position, always 0.\n\nSo for each freeway k, and each car on it, the span at time τ is:\n\nSince all cars right-moving, for a car with head h, tail τ at t1, direction right, speed s.\n\nAt time t1, span is [τ, h] assuming h > τ since it's right-moving, head is front.\n\nIn the table, for example, freeway 1: (6, -5, right, 6), so head=6, tail=-5, so at t1=9, span is [-5, 6]? Tail -5 to head 6, so positions from -5 to 6 inclusive?\n\nSpan is given as (head, tail), and for right-moving, it's from tail to head, I think, with tail left, head right.\n\nIn the update: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSo at t1, it's [τ, h], so the car occupies x from τ to h inclusive.\n\nFor example, freeway 1, car 1: head=6, tail=-5? Tail -5, head 6, so from -5 to 6, that's length 12, but speed 6, etc.\n\nBut at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-5, 6].\n\nSimilarly, another car (54,43, right,6), so [43,54]? Head 54, tail 43, so [43,54].\n\nNow, at time τ, the span is [τ + sτ, h + sτ] for each car, where s=6, τ relative to t1.\n\nsτ, but τ is time, s is speed, so shift by s * τ.\n\nLet δ = s * τ, so span shifts right by δ.\n\nFor a car, at time τ, span is [tail + 6τ, head + 6τ]\n\nThen, collision on freeway k at time τ if y_τ = k and 0 is in [tail + 6τ, head + 6τ] for some car on freeway k.\n\n0 is in [L, R] if L ≤ 0 ≤ R.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find for which τ, there is a car covering x=0.\n\nBut since multiple cars, I need the union of times when covered.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars: (h=6, t=-5, d=right, s=6) and (h=54, t=43, d=right, s=6)\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? \"2 | (6, -5, right, 6), (54, 43, right, 6)\" yes, identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: same: \"(6, -5, right, 6), (54, 43, right, 6)\"\n\nFreeway 4: same\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: \"(6, -5, right, 6), (42, 31, right, 6), (-36, -47, right, 6)\"\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5: \"(6, -5, right, 6), (42, 31, right, 6), (-36, -47, right, 6)\"\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nSo freeways 1-4 have two cars each: car A: tail=-5, head=6, s=6; car B: tail=43, head=54, s=6\n\nFreeways 5-8 have three cars: car A: tail=-5, head=6, s=6; car C: tail=31, head=42, s=6; car D: tail=-47, head=-36, s=6\n\nCar D: (-36,-47,right,6), so tail=-47, head=-36, so span at t1 is [-47,-36]\n\nNow for each freeway, find when x=0 is covered.\n\nFirst, for freeway k=1 to 4:\n\nCar A: tail=-5, head=6, s=6\n\nAt time τ, span: [-5 + 6τ, 6 + 6τ]\n\n0 in this span if -5 + 6τ ≤ 0 ≤ 6 + 6τ\n\nSince 6 + 6τ > 0 always for τ≥0, and -5 + 6τ ≤ 0 when 6τ ≤ 5, τ ≤ 5/6 ≈ 0.833\n\nSo for τ=0: -5 ≤0≤6, true, 0 covered.\n\nτ=1: -5+6=1 ≤0? 1 ≤0 false, and 0≤6+6=12 true, but 1≤0 false, so not covered? Inequality: L ≤0≤ R\n\nL = -5 +6τ, R=6+6τ\n\nL ≤0: -5+6τ ≤0 => 6τ ≤5 => τ ≤ 5/6\n\n0 ≤ R: 0 ≤ 6+6τ always true for τ≥0\n\nSo 0 in span only when τ ≤ 5/6, so for integer τ, only at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, L=-5, R=6, -5≤0≤6, yes.\n\nτ=1, L=-5+6=1, R=6+6=12, 1≤0? 1≤0 false, so 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSimilarly, τ=2, L=7, R=18, etc., not covering 0.\n\nNow car B: tail=43, head=54, s=6\n\nAt τ, [43+6τ, 54+6τ]\n\nL=43+6τ ≥43>0, so L>0, thus 0 < L ≤ R, so 0 not in span for any τ≥0.\n\nSimilarly, for freeways 1-4, only car A covers x=0 at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0 only.\n\nNow for freeways 5-8:\n\nCar A: same as above, covers x=0 only at τ=0.\n\nCar C: tail=31, head=42, s=6\n\n[31+6τ, 42+6τ], L=31+6τ≥31>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nCar D: tail=-47, head=-36, s=6\n\nAt τ, [-47 +6τ, -36 +6τ]\n\n0 in span if L ≤0≤ R\n\nL = -47 +6τ ≤0 => 6τ ≤47 => τ ≤ 47/6 ≈7.833\n\n0≤ R: 0 ≤ -36 +6τ => 6τ ≥36 => τ ≥6\n\nSo for τ from 6 to 7 inclusive, since τ integer.\n\nτ≥6 and τ≤7.833, so τ=6,7.\n\nAt τ=6: L=-47+36= -11, R=-36+36=0, so [-11,0], 0≤0 true, so covered.\n\nAt τ=7: L=-47+42= -5, R=-36+42=6, so [-5,6], 0 covered.\n\nAt τ=8: L=-47+48=1, R=-36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not covered.\n\nSo for freeways 5-8:\n\n- At τ=0: car A covers x=0\n\n- At τ=6 and τ=7: car D covers x=0\n\n- Other times, no coverage.\n\nCar C never covers, as L>0.\n\nNow, summary for each freeway:\n\nFor freeways 1-4: dangerous at τ=0 only.\n\nBut at τ=0, we are at y=0, which is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nCollision only on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nAt τ=0, we are at y=0, so not on a freeway, so no collision check, or safe.\n\nThe position is (0,y), and freeways are rows y=1 to 8, so when y=0 or y=9, no cars, so always safe.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0, safe.\n\nNow for freeways 1-4: at τ=0, if we were on y=1-4, but we are at y=0, so no issue. Moreover, at other times, no danger for y=1-4, except at τ=0 which we are not on.\n\nFor freeways 1-4, x=0 is covered only at τ=0, but since at τ=0 we are not on freeway, it's fine. For τ≥1, no coverage, so freeways 1-4 are always safe to be on, except possibly at τ=0 but we are not there.\n\nAt any time τ≥1, for freeways 1-4, no car covers x=0, so we can be on them safely.\n\nSimilarly, for freeways 5-8: at τ=0, coverage, but not on freeway. At τ=6 and τ=7, coverage, so if we are on freeway 5-8 at τ=6 or τ=7, collision.\n\nOther times, no coverage, so safe.\n\nNow, τ=6 and τ=7 are dangerous for y=5,6,7,8.\n\nNow, back to the player.\n\nWe start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 in min turns.\n\nActions: each turn, we can go up, down, or stay, changing y by +1, -1, 0.\n\ny must be integer between 0 and 9.\n\nSince we start at 0 and need to go to 9, and 9>0, we probably want to go up mostly.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on freeways 5-8 at times τ=6 or τ=7.\n\nτ is the time index from start.\n\nτ=0: t1+0=9, y=0\n\nAfter action a0, to y1 at τ=1 (turn 10)\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{τ}, to y_{τ+1} at τ+1.\n\nCollision at time τ if we are on a freeway and it's dangerous at that τ.\n\nFor freeways 5-8, dangerous at τ=6 and τ=7.\n\nWe need to ensure that if y_τ is between 5 and 8 at τ=6 or τ=7, we have collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nNow, min H: since we need to go from 0 to 9, min steps without obstacles is 9 up moves, H=9 actions? Let's see.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_H.\n\ny_0 = 0\n\nAfter a0, y1\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{H-1}, y_H =9\n\nNumber of actions: H, so we have positions from y0 to yH.\n\nWe want yH=9.\n\nThe minimal possible H is 9, if we go up every turn: y1=1, y2=2, ..., y9=9.\n\nBut we need to check if this path has collision.\n\nNow, at each τ, y_τ = τ for τ from 0 to 9.\n\ny_τ = τ, since start at 0, up each time.\n\nNow, check for each τ if on freeway and collision.\n\nτ=0: y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nτ=1: y=1, freeway 1. Is it dangerous? Freeway 1 is safe at all τ except τ=0, but τ=1>0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, τ=2: y=2, freeway 2, safe.\n\nτ=3: y=3, freeway 3, safe.\n\nτ=4: y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nτ=5: y=5, freeway 5. Now, at τ=5, is freeway 5 dangerous? For freeways 5-8, dangerous only at τ=6 and 7.\n\nAt τ=5, not dangerous, so safe.\n\nτ=6: y=6, freeway 6. Now τ=6, which is dangerous for freeways 5-8. So on freeway 6 at τ=6, collision with car D.\n\nOh, so collision at τ=6.\n\nSimilarly, if we continue, τ=7: y=7, freeway 7, at τ=7, dangerous, collision.\n\nτ=8: y=8, freeway 8, but at τ=8, is it dangerous? For freeways 5-8, dangerous at τ=6 and 7, not at τ=8. At τ=8, no coverage, so safe.\n\nBut at τ=6 and 7, we have collision in the direct path.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on y=5,6,7,8 at τ=6 or τ=7.\n\nSpecifically, at time τ=6 and τ=7, we must not be on rows 5,6,7,8.\n\nSince freeways 5-8.\n\nNow, what about other rows? Rows 1-4 are always safe, as we established.\n\nRow 0 and 9 safe.\n\nNow, τ=6 and τ=7 are critical times.\n\nWe need to plan the path to be not on y=5-8 at τ=6 and τ=7.\n\nWe start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H: if no obstacles, H=9.\n\nBut with obstacles at τ=6,7 for y=5-8.\n\nWe can be on other rows at those times.\n\nPossible strategies: delay or advance the arrival to the upper rows.\n\nOr stay on safe rows during critical times.\n\nSince rows 1-4 are always safe, we can stay there during τ=6 and 7.\n\nBut we need to go to 9 eventually.\n\nFirst, let's list the times: τ from 0 to H.\n\ny_τ for τ=0 to H.\n\nWe need y_H=9.\n\nAt τ=6 and τ=7, y_τ must not be in {5,6,7,8}.\n\nSo y_6 and y_7 must be in {0,1,2,3,4,9}, but y=9 is the target, probably not reached yet, so effectively {0,1,2,3,4}.\n\nSince we start from 0, and go up, it might be hard to be at low y at τ=6.\n\nSimilarly, after that, we need to reach 9.\n\nMinimal H: if we can be at y=4 at τ=6 and τ=7, for example, then go up to 9.\n\nBut from y=0 to y=4 in 6 steps? Let's see possible paths.\n\nFirst, without critical times, min steps: 9 up moves.\n\nWith critical times, we might need to take more steps or detour.\n\nBut since only rows 5-8 are dangerous at specific times, and 1-4 safe, we can spend time on 1-4 during τ=6,7.\n\nFor example, reach y=4 by some time, stay there during τ=6 and 7, then go up to 9.\n\nBut we need to reach y=4.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=4: min 4 up moves, so at τ=4, we can be at y=4.\n\nThen at τ=4, y=4.\n\nThen at τ=5, we can stay or move.\n\nBut at τ=6 and τ=7, we need y_6 and y_7 not in 5-8.\n\nSo if we are at y=4 at τ=4, we can stay: a4=S, so y5=4 (at τ=5)\n\nThen a5=S, y6=4 (τ=6)\n\nThen a6=S, y7=4 (τ=7)\n\nThen at τ=7, y=4.\n\nThen from there, go up to 9.\n\nFrom y7=4, we need to go to y=9, which takes 5 up moves: y8=5, y9=6, y10=7, y11=8, y12=9.\n\nSo H=12 actions, y12=9.\n\nBut is this minimal? Probably not, since we stayed extra time.\n\nWe could go faster but avoid the danger zone at critical times.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=4 quickly, then during critical times, we are safe at y=4.\n\nThen after τ=7, go up.\n\nBut we can go to higher rows before or after.\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=9 before τ=6, but min to 9 is 9 steps, τ=9, which is after τ=7.\n\nτ=9 is after.\n\nAt τ=6, if we are at y=9, but to reach y=9 by τ=6, that means from τ=0 to τ=6, 6 actions, y6=9.\n\nBut y0=0, to y6=9 in 6 actions: need +9 in 6 steps, impossible since max +1 per step, so y6 <=6.\n\nSimilarly, min y6=0 if all down or stay, but we need to go up.\n\ny6 can be from 0 to 6.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=7, y7 from 0 to 7.\n\nBut we need y6 not in 5-8, so y6 <=4 or y6=9, but y6<=6<9, so y6 <=4.\n\nSimilarly y7 <=4 or y7=9, but y7<=7<9, so y7 <=4.\n\nSo at τ=6 and τ=7, we must have y_τ <=4.\n\nSince y=9 not reachable yet.\n\nSo y6 <=4 and y7 <=4.\n\nNow, from start, y0=0.\n\nWe need to reach y_H=9.\n\nThe net displacement must be +9, so the number of U minus number of D must be 9.\n\nEach S adds 0.\n\nLet U, D, S be number of up, down, stay actions.\n\nThen U - D = 9\n\nAnd total actions H = U + D + S\n\nWe want min H, so min U+D+S.\n\nSince U - D =9, so U = D +9\n\nThen H = (D+9) + D + S = 2D + S +9\n\nTo min H, we need min D and S, but D and S >=0.\n\nBut we have constraints on the path.\n\ny_τ must be integer between 0 and 9.\n\nAnd at τ=6 and τ=7, y_τ <=4.\n\nNow, since we start at 0, and need to go up, but we must be low at τ=6 and 7.\n\nSo we might need to go slow in the beginning or even go down, but going down might not help since we need net up.\n\nFor example, to be low at τ=6, we can stay at low levels or move down temporarily.\n\nBut moving down means we have to come back, increasing H.\n\nSimilarly, staying increases S.\n\nSo probably, min H is achieved by going up as much as possible but ensuring y6 and y7 <=4.\n\nNow, y0=0\n\nAfter each step, y increases by at most 1.\n\nSo y_τ <= τ for all τ.\n\nSimilarly, y_τ >=0.\n\nAt τ=6, y6 <=6, but we need y6 <=4.\n\nSimilarly y7 <=7, need <=4.\n\nNow, since y6 <=4 and y6 <=6, the binding constraint is y6 <=4.\n\nSimilarly y7 <=4.\n\nNow, to have y6 <=4, since we start from 0, we can achieve this by having some downs or stays before τ=6.\n\nBut stays or downs will increase the total turns.\n\nFor example, if we go up directly but stop at y=4 by τ=4, then stay until after τ=7.\n\nAs before.\n\nBut we can go slower.\n\nMinimal way: we need to be at y<=4 at τ=6 and τ=7.\n\nThe fastest to reach y=9 is to go up, but with delay at low levels.\n\nSince we must have y6 <=4 and y7 <=4, the earliest we can reach y=9 is after τ=7.\n\nAfter τ=7, we can go up freely.\n\nNow, at τ=7, y7 <=4.\n\nThen from there, min steps to y=9 is 5, if we go up each time: y8=5, y9=6, y10=7, y11=8, y12=9.\n\nSo y12=9, H=12.\n\nBut we can reach higher before τ=7? No, because at τ=7, y7<=4, so we start from at most 4 at τ=7.\n\ny7<=4, so after that, we need at least 5 steps to reach 9.\n\nUnless we can jump, but no, only +1 per step.\n\nSo min H is at least 12? But with the stay, we have H=12.\n\nBut perhaps we can be at y=4 at τ=6 and τ=7, but reach y=4 earlier and go down or something, but that might not help.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=6 and τ=7, we can be at y=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, but we need to go up eventually.\n\nIf we stay very low, it takes more steps to reach 9.\n\nFor example, if at τ=6, y=0, then we have to go up 9 steps, but y6=0, then y7, ..., to y15=9 if all up, H=15, worse.\n\nSo better to be as high as possible at τ=7, so y7=4, then up to 9 in 5 steps.\n\ny7=4, then after 5 actions: y8=5, y9=6, y10=7, y11=8, y12=9.\n\nSo H=12 actions, y12=9.\n\nNow, is this achievable? We need to be at y=4 at τ=6 and τ=7.\n\ny6=4 and y7=4.\n\nFrom start, to reach y6=4 in 6 steps.\n\ny0=0, after 6 actions, y6=4.\n\nNet change: from 0 to 4, so U - D =4 for first 6 actions.\n\nH= U+D+S=6.\n\nU - D =4\n\nThen U = D +4\n\nH= (D+4) + D + S = 2D + S +4 =6\n\nSo 2D + S =2\n\nSince D and S >=0 integers, possible: D=0, S=2, U=4; or D=1, S=0, U=5; or D=0, S=2, U=4; etc.\n\nNow, similarly, we need y7=4, so at τ=7, y7=4.\n\nAfter action at τ=6, which determines y7.\n\ny6=4, then to have y7=4, we need a6=S.\n\nSimilarly, during τ=0 to 6, we need to reach y6=4.\n\nNow, also, no collision during the path.\n\nBut since rows 1-4 are always safe, and we are going to be on y=0 to 4 during τ=0 to 7 except when moving to higher, but during critical times we are low.\n\nSpecifically, for τ=0 to 5, we might be on various rows, but rows 1-4 safe, y=0 safe.\n\nAt τ=5, y5 could be up to 5, but if y5=5, at τ=5, freeway 5, which is safe since dangerous only at τ=6,7.\n\nSimilarly, y6=4, safe.\n\ny7=4, safe.\n\nThen after, from y7=4 to y12=9, all up, passing through y=5,6,7,8.\n\nBut at that time, τ=8,9,10,11.\n\nNow, for freeways 5-8, dangerous only at τ=6 and 7, which have passed, so no problem.\n\nFor example, at τ=8, y=5, freeway 5, but τ=8>7, no coverage, safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo path is fine.\n\nNow, min H=12? But perhaps we can do better.\n\nSuppose at τ=6, we are at y=4, but at τ=7, we could be at y=4 or lower, but we want to be high to reduce later steps.\n\nBut y7 must be <=4, so y7=4 is best.\n\nThen from there, 5 steps to 9.\n\nBut can we reach y=9 faster by not staying at 4?\n\nFor example, suppose we go up slowly, so that at τ=6, y=4, but then at τ=7, we go up to y=5? But y=5 at τ=7 is dangerous, collision.\n\nWe cannot be at y=5-8 at τ=7.\n\nSo we must have y7<=4.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=6, y6<=4.\n\nSo we cannot go above 4 at τ=6 and 7.\n\nThus, the earliest to start climbing to 9 is from τ=7 onwards.\n\nAt τ=7, y7<=4, so min y12=9, H=12.\n\nBut H=12 actions, meaning we have y0 to y12, with y12=9.\n\nNumber of turns: from τ=0 to τ=12, that's 13 positions, but actions: from τ=0 to τ=11, 12 actions, y12=9.\n\nt1 + τ, at τ=0, turn t1, position y0.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_H.\n\nWe want y_H=9.\n\nIn this case, H=12, y12=9 at turn t1+12.\n\nNow, but we might be able to have y7=4, but reach y=4 faster.\n\nFor example, go directly to y=4 in 4 steps: all up, y4=4.\n\nThen from τ=4 to τ=7, we need to stay at y=4 or below, but since we are at 4, we can stay.\n\ny4=4, then a4=S, y5=4; a5=S, y6=4; a6=S, y7=4.\n\nThen a7=U, y8=5; a8=U, y9=6; a9=U, y10=7; a10=U, y11=8; a11=U, y12=9.\n\nSo H=12 same as before.\n\nBut in this case, from τ=4 to τ=6, we are staying, which might not be necessary for the constraint, but it works.\n\nWe could go down and come back, but that would increase H, worse.\n\nSuppose at τ=5, we go down to y=3 or something, but then we have to come back, more steps.\n\nFor example, y4=4, then a4=D, y5=3; then at τ=5, y=3<=4, safe; but then to have y6<=4, we can stay or go up, but we need y7<=4.\n\nIf y5=3, then a5=U, y6=4; a6=S, y7=4; then from y7=4 to y12=9, same as before, but we used an extra down and up, so H larger, worse.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo min H=12.\n\nBut perhaps we can be at y=4 at τ=6 and τ=7, but start later or something.\n\nAnother idea: since at τ=6 and 7, we must not be on 5-8, but we could be on y=9, but impossible as y<= min(τ,9) and τ=6, y<=6<9.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 before τ=6, but impossible since y6<=6<9.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, H=12 seems minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach in less.\n\nSuppose H=11.\n\nThen y11=9.\n\ny0=0 to y11=9 in 11 steps, net +9, so U - D =9, H=U+D+S=11.\n\nU = D +9\n\nThen (D+9) + D + S =11, so 2D + S =2.\n\nSo D=0, S=2, U=9; or D=1, S=0, U=10; etc.\n\nNow, we need y6 <=4 and y7<=4.\n\ny6: after 6 actions, from y0=0, y6 <=6.\n\nBut need y6<=4.\n\nSimilarly y7<=7, need <=4.\n\nNow, since y11=9, and y7<=4, then from τ=7 to τ=11, 4 steps, y7 to y11.\n\ny11 = y7 + (U' - D') where U',D',S' for actions from τ=7 to 10? Let's see indices.\n\nPositions: y7 at τ=7, then after actions a7 to a10, we have y8,y9,y10,y11.\n\n4 actions to go from y7 to y11.\n\ny11 = y7 + Δ, where Δ is net change over 4 actions.\n\nSince each action changes y by at most 1, |Δ| <=4.\n\ny11=9, y7<=4, so 9 <= y7 +4, so y7 >=5.\n\nBut we need y7<=4.\n\nContradiction: y7<=4 and y7>=5 impossible.\n\nTherefore, for H=11, y11=9, then from y7 to y11 in 4 steps, y11 <= y7 +4, so 9 <= y7 +4, thus y7 >=5.\n\nBut we need y7 <=4, contradiction.\n\nThus H=11 impossible.\n\nSimilarly, for any H<12, let’s say H=11.\n\ny_H = y11=9.\n\ny7 to y11: 4 steps, y11 <= y7 +4, so y7 >= y11 -4 =9-4=5.\n\nBut y7 must be <=4, so y7 >=5 and y7<=4 impossible.\n\nSimilarly for H=10, y10=9.\n\ny7 to y10: 3 steps, y10 <= y7 +3, so y7 >=6.\n\nBut y7<=4, impossible.\n\nH=9, y9=9, y7 to y9: 2 steps, y9<= y7+2, y7>=7, but y7<=4 impossible.\n\nLower H worse.\n\nThus H=12 is indeed minimal.\n\nNow, we need a sequence.\n\nAs before, one way: go up to y=4 as fast as possible, then stay until τ=7, then go up to 9.\n\nGo up to y=4 in 4 steps: from τ=0 to τ=3, actions U,U,U,U.\n\ny0=0\n\na0=U, y1=1\n\na1=U, y2=2\n\na2=U, y3=3\n\na3=U, y4=4\n\nNow at τ=4, y4=4\n\nThen we need to stay at y=4 for τ=5,6,7? y_τ at times.\n\nAt τ=4, y=4\n\nWe need y6=4 and y7=4.\n\ny6 is position at τ=6.\n\nFrom y4=4, we can:\n\na4=S, then y5=4 (τ=5)\n\na5=S, y6=4 (τ=6)\n\nThen to have y7=4, a6=S, y7=4 (τ=7)\n\nThen from there:\n\na7=U, y8=5\n\na8=U, y9=6\n\na9=U, y10=7\n\na10=U, y11=8\n\na11=U, y12=9\n\nSo H=12 actions.\n\nNow, the actions: from τ=0 to τ=11.\n\nτ=0: a_{t1} = a9? t1=9, τ=0 is turn t1.\n\nSet the turns.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=9.\n\nAt turn t1=9, we are at (0,0), so y_{t1} = y_τ with τ=0.\n\nAction a_{t1 + τ} for τ=0 to H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1+H, position y_H.\n\nWe want y_H=9.\n\nIn this case, H=12, so actions from turn 9 to turn 20? t1=9.\n\nTurn: t1 + τ for τ=0 to 11.\n\nAfter a_{t1+11}, y_{12} at turn t1+12=21.\n\nList:\n\nAt turn 9 (τ=0), position y=0\n\nAction a9: U, then to y=1 at turn 10.\n\nTurn 10 (τ=1), y=1\n\nAction a10: U, to y=2 at turn 11.\n\nTurn 11 (τ=2), y=2\n\nAction a11: U, to y=3 at turn 12.\n\nTurn 12 (τ=3), y=3\n\nAction a12: U, to y=4 at turn 13.\n\nNow turn 13 (τ=4), y=4\n\nAction a13: S, to y=4 at turn 14.\n\nTurn 14 (τ=5), y=4\n\nAction a14: S, to y=4 at turn 15.\n\nTurn 15 (τ=6), y=4\n\nAction a15: S, to y=4 at turn 16.  // this is a15 for τ=6, to y7 at τ=7\n\nτ indices:\n\nAfter action at τ, to y_{τ+1}\n\nAt τ=0, turn t1+0=9, position y0=0, action a9, then to y1 at turn 10.\n\nGenerally: at turn t1 + τ, position y_τ, action a_{t1 + τ}, then to y_{τ+1} at turn t1 + τ +1.\n\nAt turn t1 + τ, we are at y_τ.\n\nAfter action, to y_{τ+1} at turn t1 + τ +1.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify actions for turns from t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_H.\n\nWe want y_H =9.\n\nIn the path above:\n\nAt τ=0, turn 9, y=0, action U\n\nThen at turn 10, y=1\n\nAction U\n\nTurn 11, y=2\n\nAction U\n\nTurn 12, y=3\n\nAction U\n\nTurn 13, y=4\n\nNow, at turn 13, τ=4?

We saw H=11 impossible.\n\nBut perhaps we can be at different positions.\n\nFor example, at τ=6, y=3, then at τ=7, y=4, but still need to reach from there.\n\ny7=4, same as before.\n\nIf y6=3, y7=4, then from y7=4 to y=9 still 5 steps.\n\nBut to reach y6=3, which is lower, might take fewer ups, but we have to get there.\n\nFor example, to have y6=3: from y0=0, in 6 actions, U-D=3.\n\nThen H first part: U+D+S=6, U-D=3, so 2U + S =9, U=3, D=0, S=3? U-D=3, H=U+D+S=6.\n\nU = D +3, so (D+3) + D + S =6, 2D + S =3.\n\nSo D=0, S=3, U=3; or D=1, S=1, U=4; etc.\n\nThen y6=3.\n\nThen a6: say U, to y7=4.\n\nThen from y7=4 to y12=9 as before, but y12=9 after 12 actions.\n\nSame H.\n\nIf we do something else, but min H=12.\n\nAnother point: at τ=5, we could be at y=4 or 5, but if y=5, at τ=5, freeway 5, safe since not critical time.\n\nBut then at τ=6, we need y6<=4, so from y5=5, to y6<=4, we must go down or stay? But stay keeps 5, which is not <=4, so must go down, a5=D, to y6=4.\n\nThen y6=4 at τ=6.\n\nThen at τ=6, y=4, then to have y7<=4, we can stay or down.\n\nBut if stay, y7=4.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nIf we go down to y=3, then later need to come back, worse.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nThus, the path above is fine.\n\nNow, for the action sequence.\n\nWe need to output actions for turns starting from t1=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have:\n\nTurn 9: U (to y=1)\n\nTurn 10: U (to y=2)\n\nTurn 11: U (to y=3)\n\nTurn 12: U (to y=4)\n\nIn the actions, at turn t, action determines next position.\n\nAt turn 9, action U, so to position at turn 10: y=1\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t1 + H -1\n\nWith H=12, so turns 9 to 20.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U  // to y=4 at turn 13\n\nThen we need to stay at turn 13,14,15 to keep y=4 at turn 14,15,16? Positions.\n\nAfter action at turn 12: U, to y=4 at turn 13.\n\nAt turn 13, position y=4, action S, to y=4 at turn 14\n\nAt turn 14, position y=4, action S, to y=4 at turn 15\n\nAt turn 15, position y=4, action S, to y=4 at turn 16\n\nAt turn 16, position y=4, action U, to y=5 at turn 17\n\nAt turn 17, position y=5, action U, to y=6 at turn 18\n\nAt turn 18, position y=6, action U, to y=7 at turn 19\n\nAt turn 19, position y=7, action U, to y=8 at turn 20\n\nAt turn 20, position y=8, action U, to y=9 at turn 21\n\nNow, the last action is at turn 20, to reach y=9 at turn 21.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from turn 9 to turn 20.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed.\n\nSince we have three stay actions, but we can reduce the stay if possible, but in this case, we need to cover τ=6 and τ=7 with y<=4.\n\nIn the above, we have y at τ=4,5,6,7 all 4, but we only need y6 and y7 <=4, y5 can be higher.\n\nFor example, at τ=5, y5 could be 5, as long as at τ=6, we go down to 4 or less.\n\nBut going down might not save time.\n\nIn terms of H, it might be same.\n\nFor example: go up to y=5 by τ=5.\n\ny0=0\n\na0=U, y1=1\n\na1=U, y2=2\n\na2=U, y3=3\n\na3=U, y4=4\n\na4=U, y5=5  // at τ=5, y=5\n\nNow at τ=5, turn t1+5=14? t1=9, τ=5, turn 14, position y5=5\n\nAction at turn 14: must go down to avoid y=5 at τ=6? At τ=5, y=5, freeway 5, but τ=5 not critical, safe.\n\nThen at turn 14, action: to have y6<=4, so since y5=5, we need to go down, a5=D, then y6=4 at τ=6.\n\nThen at τ=6, y=4.\n\nThen to have y7<=4, at turn 15 (τ=6), action: if S, y7=4; or U to 5, but y=5 at τ=7 is dangerous, so must S or D.\n\nIf S, y7=4.\n\nThen from y7=4, go up as before.\n\nNow, sequence:\n\nTurn 9 (τ=0): U, to y=1 turn10\n\nTurn10 (τ=1): U, to y=2 turn11\n\nTurn11 (τ=2): U, to y=3 turn12\n\nTurn12 (τ=3): U, to y=4 turn13\n\nTurn13 (τ=4): U, to y=5 turn14  // τ=4 action to y5\n\nAt turn13, τ=4, position y4=4? Indices.\n\nAt turn t1+τ, position y_τ.\n\nTurn9 (τ=0): y=0, action U\n\nTurn10 (τ=1): y=1, action U\n\nTurn11 (τ=2): y=2, action U\n\nTurn12 (τ=3): y=3, action U\n\nTurn13 (τ=4): y=4, action U  // to y5=5 at turn14\n\nNow turn14 (τ=5): y=5, action D  // to y6=4 at turn15\n\nTurn15 (τ=6): y=4, action S  // to y7=4 at turn16\n\nThen turn16 (τ=7): y=4, action U  // to y8=5 at turn17\n\nTurn17: y=5, action U to y=6 turn18\n\n...\n\nUp to turn20: action U to y=9 at turn21\n\nNow, actions: from turn9 to turn20, same 12 actions.\n\nBut now, at turn14, we did D, which is a down, but we have to go up later, so same number of steps.\n\nAnd we reached y=5 earlier but had to come down.\n\nIn terms of turns, same H=12.\n\nBut in this case, at τ=5, we were at y=5, which is fine, but we used an extra up and down, net same.\n\nIn the first sequence, we had three S, here we have U then D, which is like a stay in terms of position change, but action is different.\n\nBut H same.\n\nNow, for the output, the first sequence is fine.\n\nBut in the first sequence, we had actions U,U,U,U,S,S,S,U,U,U,U,U\n\nIn terms of turns:\n\nTurn9: U\n\n10: U\n\n11: U\n\n12: U  // after this, at turn13 y=4\n\n13: S  // to y=4 turn14\n\n14: S  // to y=4 turn15\n\n15: S  // to y=4 turn16\n\n16: U  // to y=5 turn17\n\n17: U  // to y=6 turn18\n\n18: U  // to y=7 turn19\n\n19: U  // to y=8 turn20\n\n20: U  // to y=9 turn21\n\nYes.\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH=12.\n\nBut in the answer, I think we just need the sequence.\n\nNow, but let's confirm the car states.\n\nIn freeways 5-8, at τ=6 and 7, car D covers x=0.\n\nIn the sequence, we are not on those rows at those times.\n\nFor example, at τ=6, turn15, we are at y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nAt τ=7, turn16, y=4, same.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence with less actions, but we saw impossible.\n\nAnother thought: can we be on y=9 at τ=7? But y7<=7<9, impossible.\n\nOr at τ=6, y=9 impossible.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H is 12.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: S\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\n}\n\nIn the sequence, turn 13 to 15 are S, but turn 16 to 20 U except turn 16 is U to go to 5.\n\nIn the list, turn 16: U to go from y=4 to y=5.\n\nBut in the action, it's fine.\n\nTo make it cleaner, but it's minimal.\n\nSince we need to reach, and we have to avoid, this should be fine.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeways 1-4, there is car B at [43,54] which never covers 0, and car A only at τ=0, but not on freeway.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I think correct.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) is 12, considering the need to avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at critical times \\(\\tau = 6\\) and \\(\\tau = 7\\) (relative to \\(t_1\\)), where \\(\\tau = T - t_1\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Car Dynamics**: For freeways 1-4, the cars cover \\(x = 0\\) only at \\(\\tau = 0\\), but since the player starts at \\(y = 0\\) (not a freeway), no collision occurs. For \\(\\tau \\geq 1\\), freeways 1-4 are safe. For freeways 5-8, the cars cover \\(x = 0\\) at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (safe, as player is at \\(y = 0\\)), and at \\(\\tau = 6\\) and \\(\\tau = 7\\) (dangerous). Thus, the player must not be on freeways 5-8 (\\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\)) at \\(\\tau = 6\\) and \\(\\tau = 7\\).\n- **Constraints**: At \\(\\tau = 6\\) and \\(\\tau = 7\\), \\(y_\\tau \\leq 4\\) to avoid collision. Since \\(y_0 = 0\\) and the maximum \\(y\\) at \\(\\tau = 7\\) is 7, \\(y_7 \\leq 4\\) implies that reaching \\(y = 9\\) requires at least 5 additional actions from \\(y_7 = 4\\). The minimum \\(H\\) to achieve \\(y_H = 9\\) with these constraints is 12, as \\(H = 11\\) or less leads to a contradiction (\\(y_7 \\geq 5\\) but \\(y_7 \\leq 4\\) is required).\n- **Path Selection**: The player moves up to \\(y = 4\\) by \\(\\tau = 4\\) (turn 13), stays at \\(y = 4\\) during \\(\\tau = 4\\) to \\(\\tau = 7\\) (turns 13 to 16) to avoid the danger zone at \\(\\tau = 6\\) and \\(\\tau = 7\\), then moves up to \\(y = 9\\) in the remaining turns.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 10, and I start at y=1.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. All cars are moving right with speed 6, except for the ones on freeways 5 to 8 which have an extra car that might be moving right too.\n\nLooking at the car states:\n\nFor freeways 1 to 4: two cars each, both right-moving, speed 6. Head and tail given as (h, τ, d, s). For the first car: (12, 1, right, 6). Since it's right-moving, the span at time t is [τ + s(t - t_1), h + s(t - t_1)]? Let me read the update rule.\n\nThe update says for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nBut in the initial state at t_1, for a right-moving car, Span(t_1) should be [τ, h], so h must be greater than τ since it's moving right.\n\nIn the given: (12, 1, right, 6), so at t_1=10, span is [1,12]? Head is 12, tail is 1, so if it's right-moving, the head is at 12, tail at 1, so span is from 1 to 12.\n\nSimilarly, the second car (60,49,right,6), span [49,60].\n\nBut for freeway 5 to 8, there is a third car (-30,-41,right,6), which has tail -41, head -30, so span [-41,-30] at t_1.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is at some y, and for the car on that freeway y, 0 is in the span at time T.\n\nThe player is at (0, y_T) at turn T, meaning on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nAnd collision if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on that freeway.\n\nAlso, important: when moving, if you move to a different y at turn T, you are not on that new freeway until turn T+1? No.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThis is a bit tricky.\n\nAt turn T, you are on freeway y_T.\n\nYou choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nThen, at turn T+1, you are at position (0, y_{T+1}).\n\nThe collision check is at each turn for your current position.\n\nSpecifically: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd since at turn T, you are on y_T, so for that freeway, if 0 is in any car's span at time T, collision.\n\nNow, when you move, at turn T, you are on y_T. After action, you move to y_{T+1}, but that position is only occupied at turn T+1.\n\nThe note says that if you move to a different freeway, say from y to y' at turn T, then at turn T, you are still on y, so only cars on y matter for collision at T. At turn T+1, you are on y', so cars on y' matter, but only if 0 in span at T+1.\n\nThe note emphasizes that you are not on y' at turn T, so even if 0 is in span for y' at time T, since you are not on y' at T, no collision. Similarly, if you move away, and at time T, 0 was in span for y, but you move, but since you were on y at T, if 0 in span for y at T, you collide, I think.\n\nLet's parse the note.\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on y_T, not on y_{T+1}. Therefore, for collision at turn T, only freeway y_T is checked.\n\nCars on other freeways don't matter at that turn.\n\nThen, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so only freeway y_{T+1} is checked for collision.\n\nThe \"thus\" part says: you won't be collided by cars on y_{T+1} even if 0 ∈ Span(T) for y_{T+1}, because you are not on it at T. But since collision is only checked when you are on that freeway, it's fine.\n\nThe key point is that collision only happens on the freeway you are currently on at that turn.\n\nSo for each turn, based on your y_t, check if 0 is in any car span on that freeway at time t.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn t_1=10, position (0,1).\n\nI need to reach (0,9) as soon as possible.\n\nActions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same).\n\ny must be between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nCurrently at y=1, target y=9, so I need to go up 8 units. Each U action increases y by 1, so minimum H would be 8 if I could go straight up without colliding.\n\nBut there might be cars blocking, so I need to avoid them by moving down or staying sometimes.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the starting turn? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, but t is relative to t_1.\n\nDefine: let τ = t - t_1, so at τ=0, turn t_1, position y_{t_1} =1.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's read.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at time t_1 + 0 to t_1 + (H-1).\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + t}, the position is updated to y_{t_1 + t +1}.\n\nThe position after action a_t is y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, y_{t_1} =1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have applied a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and the position after the last action is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9? No.\n\nThe target is to reach (0,9), which means at some turn, y_t =9.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9)\", and \"such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so t from 0 to H-1, actions at times t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H -1}, position is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which is the position before action a_{t_1 + H -1}? I'm confused.\n\nAt turn T, position is y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, position becomes y_{T+1}.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, y_{t_1} =1.\n\nWe apply actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nAfter a_{t_1 + H -1}, position is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want the position to be 9 at turn t_1 + H -1? That doesn't make sense because at turn t_1 + H -1, position is y_{t_1 + H -1}, and after action, it changes.\n\nThe condition is y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, meaning that at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9.\n\nThen, we don't necessarily take an action at that turn? But the sequence includes actions from t=0 to H-1, so for H turns, we have H actions.\n\nLet's see the indices.\n\nSet T = t_1 + k for k=0 to H-1.\n\nAt k=0, turn t_1, position y_{t_1} =1.\n\nWe choose action a_{t_1}, then position becomes y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy.\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, position y_{t_1 +1}, choose a_{t_1 +1}, and so on, up to choose a_{t_1 + H -1}, then position becomes y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + H -1 is y_{t_1 + H -1}, and we want this to be 9.\n\nAfter choosing a_{t_1 + H -1}, we move to y_{t_1 + H}, but we don't care about that, as long as at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at 9.\n\nSo for example, if H=1, then we only have action at t_1, but at turn t_1, we are at y=1, not 9, so we need to take actions to move to 9.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=9 is turn t_1 + H -1, with H actions taken from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nThe number of actions is H, and we reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nSince we start at turn t_1, after 0 actions, at y=1. After 1 action, at turn t_1+1, position y_{t_1+1}, and so on. After H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want to be at y=9 at some turn, and it's specified as y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which is after H-1 actions.\n\nAfter k actions, we are at turn t_1 + k, position y_{t_1 + k}.\n\nAt k=0, turn t_1, y=1.\n\nAfter 1 action (k=1), turn t_1+1, y_{t_1+1}.\n\n...\n\nAfter m actions, turn t_1 + m, position y_{t_1 + m}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + m} =9 for some m.\n\nThen the number of turns from start to that point is m, but the sequence has actions from t_1 to t_1 + m -1, so H = m actions, and we reach at turn t_1 + m.\n\nBut the problem says y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet the reach turn as T_reach = t_1 + H -1, so y_{T_reach} =9.\n\nThen from start turn t_1, we have H-1 actions to go from turn t_1 to T_reach.\n\nAt turn t_1, position y_{t_1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, we go to y_{t_1 +1} at turn t_1+1.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 +1}, to y_{t_1+2} at turn t_1+2, and so on.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H -2}, we go to y_{t_1 + H -1} at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y_{t_1 + H -1}, and we want this to be 9.\n\nWe don't take an action at that turn for reaching; the last action is a_{t_1 + H -2} to get to y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have actions from t=0 to H-1, which is a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nFor the position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9, it means that after action a_{t_1 + H -2}, we are at y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThen we also have a_{t_1 + H -1}, which might move us away, but since we only care about reaching at that turn, it might be that we take an action but we are already there.\n\nThe condition is only that at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9, regardless of the action.\n\nBut to reach there, we need the actions before.\n\nFor the sequence, we include a_{t_1 + H -1}, but since we are already at 9, we can choose S or something, but it might cause collision if we stay, but at y=9, we need to check if it's safe.\n\nThe target is to be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1, so we need to ensure that at that turn, for freeway 9, there is no collision, but freeway 9 has no cars, since cars are only on y=1 to 8, so y=9 is always safe, no cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 has no cars, but we start from y=1.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no freeways or no cars, so they are safe.\n\nIn the car state, only freeways 1 to 8 are listed, so y=0 and y=9 are clear.\n\nSo at y=9, no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly for y=0.\n\nBack to the point.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn T with T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe number of actions is H, from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe position after the actions: after a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2}, we get to y_{t_1 + H -1} at turn t_1 + H -1, and then a_{t_1 + H -1} is chosen but doesn't affect the position at that turn.\n\nSince we reach at turn t_1 + H -1, and we need to output the action at that turn as well, but for reaching, it's fine.\n\nFor minimal H, we need to find the earliest turn when we can be at y=9 safely.\n\nNow, from y=1 to y=9, we need to increase y by 8, so each U increases by 1, S or D don't, so to minimize turns, we should use as many U as possible, but we might need to avoid cars by staying or moving down temporarily.\n\nH will be at least 8, if we can go straight up.\n\nBut with cars, it might take more if we have to wait.\n\nFirst, let's model the car positions over time.\n\nt_1 = 10.\n\nFor each freeway, at time T, the span for each car.\n\nSince cars are moving right with speed 6, the position changes linearly.\n\nFor a right-moving car, at time T, span is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nWith t_1=10, s=6 for all cars.\n\nAlso, collision if 0 is in the span at time T for the freeway we are on.\n\n0 is the x-position where the player is, always at x=0.\n\nSo for a car, if the span covers x=0 at time T, then collision if we are on that freeway.\n\nNow, the span is a interval on the x-axis.\n\nFor a car, the span at T is [low(T), high(T)] for right-moving, low(T) = τ + 6(T-10), high(T) = h + 6(T-10)\n\nFor left-moving, but all are right-moving here.\n\nIn the data, all cars are right-moving, no left-moving.\n\nFreeway 1: cars (12,1,right,6) and (60,49,right,6)\n\nAt t_1=10, car1: [1 + 6(10-10), 12 + 6(10-10)] = [1,12]\n\nCar2: [49,60]\n\nAt time T, car1: [1 + 6(T-10), 12 + 6(T-10)] = [1 + 6(T-10), 12 + 6(T-10)]\n\nSimilarly, car2: [49 + 6(T-10), 60 + 6(T-10)]\n\n0 is in the span if low(T) <= 0 <= high(T) for some car.\n\nFor car1 on freeway 1, 0 in span if 1 + 6(T-10) <= 0 <= 12 + 6(T-10)\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nBut since the cars are long, and moving right, they will cover x=0 at certain times.\n\nLet's find for each freeway, when x=0 is covered by any car.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: two cars.\n\nCar1: span [1 + 6ΔT, 12 + 6ΔT] where ΔT = T-10\n\n0 in [1+6ΔT, 12+6ΔT] if 1+6ΔT <= 0 <= 12+6ΔT\n\nLeft inequality: 1+6ΔT <= 0 => 6ΔT <= -1 => ΔT <= -1/6, not possible since ΔT >=0, T>=10.\n\n1+6ΔT >=1 >0 for all ΔT>=0, so 0 < low, so 0 not in [low,high] since low>0.\n\nSimilarly, high=12+6ΔT >0, but since low>0, 0 not in the interval.\n\nCar2: [49+6ΔT, 60+6ΔT], both >49>0, so 0 not in span ever for car2 on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2, same cars: (12,1,right,6) and (60,49,right,6), identical to freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3 and 4, all have the same two cars.\n\nBut freeway 1 to 4 all have (12,1,right,6) and (60,49,right,6), so same situation.\n\nFor freeway 1, car1: low=1+6ΔT >=1>0, so 0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly car2 low=49+6ΔT>0, not covered.\n\nSo for freeway 1, at no time is 0 covered by any car. So freeway 1 is always safe? But at T=10, ΔT=0, car1 span [1,12], 0 not in it, yes.\n\nSimilarly for all T, since both cars are to the right of 0 and moving right, so x=0 never occupied.\n\nBut the player is at x=0, so if the car span includes x=0, but here it doesn't.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2,3,4, same.\n\nNow freeway 5 to 8 have three cars each.\n\nFreeway 5: cars (12,1,right,6), (48,37,right,6), and (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\nFirst, car1: (12,1,right,6), same as before, span [1+6ΔT, 12+6ΔT], low=1+6ΔT >=1>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nCar2: (48,37,right,6), span [37+6ΔT, 48+6ΔT], low=37+6ΔT>=37>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nCar3: (-30,-41,right,6), at t_1=10, span [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-41 +6ΔT, -30 +6ΔT]\n\nFor this car, low = -41 +6ΔT, high = -30 +6ΔT\n\n0 in span if low <= 0 <= high, i.e., -41 +6ΔT <= 0 <= -30 +6ΔT\n\nLeft: -41 +6ΔT <= 0 => 6ΔT <= 41 => ΔT <= 41/6 ≈ 6.833\n\nRight: 0 <= -30 +6ΔT => 6ΔT >=30 => ΔT >=5\n\nSo for ΔT from 5 to 6.833, i.e., T from t_1+5=15 to t_1+6=16, but ΔT=5, T=15; ΔT=6, T=16; ΔT=6.833, T=16.833, so since T integer, ΔT=5,6.\n\nΔT=5: low = -41 +6*5 = -41+30= -11, high= -30+30=0\n\n0 <= high=0, so 0 is included.\n\nΔT=6: low= -41+36= -5, high= -30+36=6, so 0 in [-5,6], yes.\n\nΔT=7: low= -41+42=1, high= -30+42=12, 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo for car3 on freeway 5, 0 in span when ΔT=5 and ΔT=6, i.e., T=15 and T=16.\n\nSimilarly for freeways 6,7,8, same car, so for each, at T=15 and 16, if on freeway 5,6,7, or 8, collision if on that freeway at T=15 or 16.\n\nNow, for freeway 1 to 4, as we saw, no car ever covers x=0, so always safe.\n\nFreeway 5 to 8 have the car that covers x=0 at T=15 and 16.\n\nBut for freeway 5 to 8, the first two cars don't cover x=0, only the third one at T=15 and 16.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn t_1=10, y=1.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=1 to y=8 are freeways with cars, y=9 no cars, safe.\n\ny=0 no cars, safe.\n\nNow, since freeways 1-4 are always safe, freeways 5-8 are safe except at T=15 and 16.\n\nSpecifically, for y=5,6,7,8, if we are on that freeway at turn 15 or 16, we collide.\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nNow, we start at turn 10, y=1.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, which is always safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince we start at y=1, and need to go to y=9, we can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn.\n\nMinimal turns: if we go up every turn, from y=1 to y=2 at turn 11, y=3 at turn 12, ..., up to y=9 at turn 18.\n\nTurn 10: y=1\n\nAfter action U at turn 10: y=2 at turn 11\n\nU at turn 11: y=3 at turn 12\n\n...\n\nU at turn 17: y=9 at turn 18.\n\nSo at turn 18, y=9.\n\nNow, H such that t_1 + H -1 =18, t_1=10, so 10 + H -1 =18, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions from t=10 to t=10+H-1=18? Let's see.\n\nReach at turn 18, which is t_1 + H -1 =18, t_1=10, so 10 + H -1 =18, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nSequence: actions at turn 10 to turn 10+8=18? t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t_1 + t for t=0 to 8, so turns 10 to 18.\n\nBut at turn 18, we take action, but position at turn 18 is y=9 before action or after?\n\nAt turn 18, position y_18.\n\nAfter action a_18, y_19.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{10+9-1}=y_{18} =9.\n\nSo at turn 18, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions from turn 10 to turn 18, which is 9 actions.\n\nFor the path: from turn 10 to 17, we take actions to go up, and at turn 18, we are at y=9.\n\nNow, check if this path is safe.\n\nAt each turn, we are on a freeway, need to check collision.\n\nTurn 10: y=1, freeway 1, which is always safe, as we saw.\n\nAction: say U, then to y=2 at turn 11.\n\nTurn 11: y=2, freeway 2, which is also always safe (since freeway 2 is like 1, always safe).\n\nAction U, to y=3 at turn 12.\n\nTurn 12: y=3, freeway 3, safe, U to y=4 at turn 13.\n\nTurn 13: y=4, freeway 4, safe, U to y=5 at turn 14.\n\nNow turn 14: y=5, freeway 5.\n\nAt turn 14, T=14, ΔT=14-10=4.\n\nFor freeway 5, at T=14, ΔT=4.\n\nCar3: low = -41 +6*4 = -41+24= -17, high= -30+24= -6, so span [-17,-6], 0 not in it.\n\nOther cars not cover, so safe.\n\nAction U, to y=6 at turn 15.\n\nTurn 15: y=6, freeway 6.\n\nT=15, ΔT=5.\n\nFor freeway 6, at T=15, car3: low= -41 +6*5 = -41+30= -11, high= -30+30=0, so [ -11, 0], and 0 <= high=0, so 0 is included, so collision if on freeway 6 at T=15.\n\nBut we are on freeway 6 at turn 15, so collision! Not safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=6 at turn 15, we collide.\n\nIn this path, at turn 15 we are at y=6, which is unsafe.\n\nWe could go to y=7 at turn 15, but y=7 is also freeway 7, which at T=15, same issue, car3 covers x=0, so collision.\n\nSimilarly for y=5,6,7,8 at T=15 or 16.\n\nSpecifically, for freeways 5-8, at T=15 and 16, unsafe.\n\nIn the direct path:\n\nAt turn 14: y=5, which is freeway 5, T=14, ΔT=4, safe as above.\n\nThen if we go U to y=6 at turn 15, but at turn 15, y=6, unsafe.\n\nIf we stay at turn 14, action S, then at turn 15, y=5 still, freeway 5, T=15, unsafe.\n\nIf we go down to y=4, but y=4 is freeway 4, which is always safe, but then we are moving away from target.\n\nWe need to avoid being on freeways 5-8 at turns 15 and 16.\n\nTurns 15 and 16 are dangerous for y=5,6,7,8.\n\nWe need to be on y=1-4 or y=9 at those turns, or y=0, but y=0 is possible.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nSince we start at turn 10, we can delay or adjust the path.\n\nMinimal H: we need to reach y=9 by some turn.\n\nThe direct path reaches at turn 18 but has collision at turn 15.\n\nWe need to spend turns 15 and 16 not on y=5-8.\n\nOptions: at turn 15 and 16, be on y=1-4 or y=9 or y=0.\n\nBut y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nNow, we start from y=1 at turn 10.\n\nWe can go up slowly or down.\n\nBut to minimize turns, we should go up as much as possible, but avoid the danger times.\n\nThe danger times are fixed: T=15 and 16 for y=5-8.\n\nWe need to ensure that at T=15 and 16, we are not on y=5-8.\n\nSince we can be on lower y or higher.\n\nBut y=9 is safe, so if we can reach y=9 before turn 15, that would be good, but turn 15 is only 5 turns after start.\n\nFrom y=1 to y=9, need 8 up moves, so minimum 8 turns, but with actions starting turn 10.\n\nAt turn 10: y=1\n\nAfter k up moves, at turn 10+k, y=1+k.\n\nSet y=9 at turn T, so 1 + number of U - number of D =9, but since we start at 1.\n\nLet N_U be number of U, N_D number of D, N_S number of S.\n\nThen final y = 1 + N_U - N_D =9, so N_U - N_D =8.\n\nTotal turns H = N_U + N_D + N_S.\n\nWe want min H, so minimize the time to reach.\n\nSince N_U - N_D =8, and H = N_U + N_D + N_S, to min H, we want min N_D and N_S, so ideally N_D=0, N_S=0, H= N_U =8, reach at turn 10+8=18? Turns: from turn 10 to turn 17, we take 8 actions to go up, at turn 18, y=9.\n\nBut as before, at turn 15, we are at y=6, which is unsafe.\n\nTo avoid that, we need to not be on y=5-8 at T=15 and 16.\n\nT=15 and 16 are turns.\n\nWe can be on lower y at those turns.\n\nFor example, at turn 15, be on y=4 or below, or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 at turn 15: from y=1 at turn 10, to y=9 at turn 15, that would require 8 up moves in 5 turns? From turn 10 to turn 15 is 5 steps: actions at turn 10,11,12,13,14 to reach y at turn 15.\n\nAt turn 10: y=1\n\nAfter action a10, y11\n\na11, y12\n\na12, y13\n\na13, y14\n\na14, y15\n\nSo to have y15=9, we need to go from y=1 to y=9 in 5 actions, so net +8, but each U +1, D -1, S 0, so to have +8 in 5 actions, must have at least 8 U, but only 5 actions, impossible. Max increase is 5, to y=6. So cannot reach y=9 before turn 18, as before.\n\nSimilarly, turn 16: y16=9, actions from turn 10 to 15, 6 actions, max y=1+6=7, cannot reach 9.\n\nTurn 17: actions turn 10 to 16, 7 actions, max y=1+7=8.\n\nTurn 18: actions turn 10 to 17, 8 actions, y=1+8=9.\n\nSo earliest possible reach turn is 18, at y=9.\n\nBut at turn 15, we are at y=6, which is unsafe if we go straight up.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 16, y=7, unsafe.\n\nIn the straight path: turn 15 y=6, turn 16 y=7, both unsafe.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=5-8 at turns 15 and 16.\n\nSince we must be at y=9 at turn 18, we need to be somewhere at turn 15 and 16.\n\nOptions: at turn 15, be on y=1,2,3,4, or 9, but y=9 not possible before 18.\n\nSimilarly turn 16, same.\n\nSo must be on y=1-4 at turn 15 and 16.\n\nThen at turn 17, we can go to higher, but we need to reach y=9 at turn 18.\n\nNow, from turn 10 to turn 15 is 5 turns (actions at 10,11,12,13,14 to set y15).\n\nSimilarly, to set y16, actions up to a15.\n\nLet me list the turns and required y.\n\nDenote the position at turn T.\n\nTurn 10: y=1 (fixed)\n\nWe need y18=9.\n\nFor turn 15 and 16, y must be <=4 to be safe, since y=1-4 are always safe.\n\ny=0 also safe, but we can use.\n\nNow, at turn 15, y15 <=4.\n\nAt turn 16, y16 <=4.\n\nThen at turn 17, we can go up, and turn 18 to 9.\n\nBut y18=9, so from y17, we need to go up to y18=9, so y17 must be 8 or 9, but if we go up, y17=8, then U to y18=9.\n\nIf y17=9, then S or whatever, but we need y18=9, so y17 can be 8 or 9.\n\nBut at turn 17, we need to be safe.\n\nTurn 17: T=17, ΔT=7.\n\nFor freeways 5-8, at T=17, ΔT=7, car3: low= -41 +6*7= -41+42=1, high= -30+42=12, span [1,12], 0 not in, so safe for all freeways.\n\nSimilarly, T=18, ΔT=8, car3: low= -41+48=7, high= -30+48=18, 0 not in.\n\nSo after T=16, freeways 5-8 are safe.\n\nDanger only at T=15 and 16.\n\nSo at turn 17, all y safe.\n\nSimilarly turn 18, safe.\n\nNow back to the plan.\n\nWe need y15 <=4 and y16 <=4.\n\nThen from turn 16 to turn 18, we need to go from y16 <=4 to y18=9.\n\nIn two steps, we can increase by at most 2, so if y16=4, then y17 <=6 (if U), y18<=7, not 9.\n\ny16 <=4, say y16=4.\n\nThen action at turn 16: if U, y17=5; if S, y17=4; if D, y17=3.\n\nThen at turn 17, from y17, to y18.\n\nTo reach y18=9, we need y17=8 or 9.\n\nBut from y16=4, y17 <=5 if U, or less, so y17 <=5 <8, cannot reach y18=9.\n\nIf y16=3, y17<=4, worse.\n\ny16 <=4, so y17 <=5, then y18 <=6, cannot reach 9.\n\nBut we need y18=9.\n\nProblem.\n\ny16 <=4, y17 <= y16 +1 <=5, y18 <= y17 +1 <=6 <9.\n\nImpossible to reach y=9 at turn 18 if y16 <=4.\n\nBut earlier we must have y16 <=4 to be safe at turn 16.\n\nThen we cannot reach y=9 by turn 18.\n\nWe need to reach later.\n\nMinimal turn to reach y=9 is turn 18, but if we have to have y16<=4, then we cannot reach by 18.\n\nSo we must reach after turn 18.\n\nFor example, at turn 19.\n\nThen H such that t_1 + H -1 =19, t_1=10, so 10 + H -1=19, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nReach at turn 19.\n\nThen actions from turn 10 to 18? Let's define.\n\nReach at turn T_reach = t_1 + H -1 =19.\n\nSo H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions at turn 10 to 19? t from 0 to H-1=9, so actions at turn 10 to 19.\n\nBut position at turn 19 is y19=9.\n\nNow, from turn 10 to 18 actions.\n\nWe need to have y15 and y16 <=4 to avoid collision.\n\nAlso, since we reach later, we can have more turns.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so minimal T_reach.\n\nWhat is the earliest possible T_reach.\n\nSince we must avoid being on y=5-8 at T=15,16, we need to be at y<=4 or y=9 at those turns.\n\nBut y=9 not possible before turn 18, so must be at y<=4 at turn 15 and 16.\n\nThen from there, we need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y<=4 at turn 16, to y=9.\n\nEach step can increase by at most 1, so need at least 5 steps: to go from y=4 to y=9, min 5 U, in 5 turns.\n\nFrom turn 16 to turn 21, for example.\n\ny16 <=4\n\ny17 = y16 + Δy <=5\n\ny18 <=6\n\ny19 <=7\n\ny20 <=8\n\ny21 <=9\n\nSo earliest y21=9 if we go all up.\n\nBut y21=9 at turn 21.\n\nThen T_reach=21, t_1=10, so 10 + H -1 =21, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nBut we can start from higher y at turn 16.\n\ny16 <=4, say y16=4, then after 5 U actions, y21=9.\n\nBut turn 21 is late.\n\nWe might reach earlier if we are at higher y earlier, but constrained at turn 15 and 16.\n\nTurn 15: y15 <=4\n\nTurn 16: y16 <=4\n\nThen turn 17: y17 <= y16 +1 <=5\n\nTurn 18: y18 <= y17 +1 <=6\n\nTurn 19: y19 <= y18 +1 <=7\n\nTurn 20: y20 <= y19 +1 <=8\n\nTurn 21: y21 <= y20 +1 <=9\n\nSo to have y21=9, we need all increases, so y16=4, y17=5, y18=6, y19=7, y20=8, y21=9.\n\nAnd at turn 18,19,20, we are on y=6,7,8, but since T=18,19,20 >16, freeways 5-8 are safe, as we saw after T=16, no problem.\n\nT=18: ΔT=8, car3 low= -41+48=7, high=18, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo possible, but T_reach=21, H=12 for 11 actions? Let's calculate.\n\nT_reach=21, t_1=10, 10 + H -1 =21, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions from turn 10 to 21? t from 0 to 11, actions at turn 10 to 21? No.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, H=12, t=0 to 11, actions at turn 10+0 to 10+11=21.\n\nPosition at turn t_1 + H -1 =10+12-1=21, y21=9.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nAt turn 15 and 16, we are at y<=4, but we can be at y=4 at turn 16, and then go up as much as possible.\n\nBut from turn 16 to turn 21 is 5 turns to gain 5, to y=9.\n\nBut turn 21 is late.\n\nWe need to reach before, but turn 18 is impossible as we saw.\n\nWhat about reaching at turn 19 or 20.\n\nIf we reach at turn 19, y19=9.\n\nThen from turn 16, y16 <=4, to y19=9.\n\nActions: from turn 16 to 18, three actions to set y19.\n\ny19 depends on actions at turn 16,17,18.\n\ny19 = y16 + Δy16 + Δy17 + Δy18\n\nEach Δy <=1, so y19 <= y16 +3 <=4+3=7 <9, cannot reach 9.\n\nSimilarly, if reach at turn 20, y20=9.\n\ny20 = y16 + Δy16 + Δy17 + Δy18 + Δy19\n\n<= y16 +4 <=4+4=8<9, still not 9.\n\ny20 <=8 if y16<=4.\n\nThen at turn 21, y21 <=9, so possible only if y16=4 and all U.\n\nThus minimal reach turn is 21, with y16=4, and y17=5, y18=6, y19=7, y20=8, y21=9.\n\nBut H=12.\n\nBut we start from y=1 at turn 10.\n\nWe need to get to y=4 at turn 16, with y15<=4.\n\nSince y15<=4 and y16<=4.\n\nNow, from turn 10 to turn 15, 5 actions to set y15.\n\ny10=1\n\ny15 = y10 + sum_{t=10 to14} Δy_t = 1 + number of U minus number of D from actions at turn 10 to14.\n\nWe need y15 <=4.\n\nSimilarly, y16 = y15 + Δy15 <=4.\n\nSince y15 <=4, and to have y16<=4, we need Δy15 <=0, so action at turn 15 must be S or D.\n\nBut y16 <=4 must hold, and since y15 <=4, if we do S or D, y16 <=4.\n\nIf U, y16 = y15 +1 <=5, but we need y16<=4, so we must not do U at turn 15 if y15=4; if y15<4, we could do U, but y16<=4, so if y15=3, U to y16=4, ok; but y15<=4, so to have y16<=4, we need that if y15=4, then action must be S or D; if y15<4, we can do S, D, or U to y16<=4.\n\nBut since we want to minimize time, we probably want to be as high as possible at turn 16, so y16=4.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 15, y15 should be as high as possible, so y15=4.\n\nThen at turn 15, since y15=4, to have y16<=4, we must do S or D, so y16=4 or 3.\n\nBut we want y16=4, so do S at turn 15.\n\nThen y16=4.\n\nThen from there, we need to go to y=9 at turn 21.\n\nWith y17=5, y18=6, y19=7, y20=8, y21=9.\n\nAll U actions.\n\nNow, check if this is safe.\n\nFirst, from turn 10 to turn 14, we need to go from y=1 to y=4 at turn 15.\n\ny15=4.\n\nAt turn 15, y=4.\n\nNow, turn 15: T=15, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4: as earlier, for freeways 1-4, no car covers x=0 ever, so safe.\n\nAction S, so y16=4.\n\nTurn 16: y=4, freeway 4, safe (T=16, still safe for y=1-4).\n\nAction U? But at turn 16, we are at y=4, and we need to set for future.\n\nIn this plan, at turn 16, we are at y=4, and we do U to go to y=5 at turn 17.\n\nBut at turn 16, T=16, if we are on y=5-8, unsafe, but we are on y=4, safe.\n\nAfter action, to y=5 at turn 17.\n\nTurn 17: y=5, freeway 5, T=17, ΔT=7, car3 span [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U to y=6 at turn 18.\n\nTurn 18: y=6, freeway 6, T=18, ΔT=8, car3 [7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nU to y=7 at turn 19.\n\nTurn 19: y=7, freeway 7, T=19, ΔT=9, car3 low= -41+54=13, high= -30+54=24, 0 not in, safe.\n\nU to y=8 at turn 20.\n\nTurn 20: y=8, freeway 8, T=20, ΔT=10, car3 low= -41+60=19, high= -30+60=30, safe.\n\nU to y=9 at turn 21.\n\nTurn 21: y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nNow, we need to get from turn 10 y=1 to turn 15 y=4.\n\nWith 5 actions: turn 10,11,12,13,14 actions to set y15=4.\n\ny10=1\n\ny15 = 1 + sum_{t=10 to14} Δy_t\n\nWe need y15=4, so net increase of 3 from turn 10 to 15.\n\nIn 5 actions, we need to have N_U - N_D =3, since N_S doesn't change y.\n\nAnd H_early = N_U + N_D + N_S for these 5 actions.\n\nTo minimize time, we don't care about these actions as long as we reach y=4 at turn 15, since the critical part is later.\n\nBut to minimize total H, we need to reach y=9 asap, but here T_reach=21 is fixed once we have the constraint.\n\nIn this case, with y16=4, we need 5 more turns to y=9, so T_reach=21.\n\nBut can we reach earlier by having y16 higher? But y16<=4, so maximum y16=4.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 at turn 20 or 19, but earlier we saw it's impossible if y16<=4.\n\nUnless we can reach y=9 before turn 18, but we can't, min turn 18.\n\nAt turn 18, if we could be at y=9, but with y16<=4, impossible.\n\nSo T_reach=21 is the earliest possible.\n\nBut let's confirm the number of turns.\n\nFrom start to reach: from turn 10 to turn 21, that's 11 turns later, but we reach at turn 21.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 10 to 20, to set y21=9.\n\nActions at turn 10 to 20, 11 actions, H=11? Let's see.\n\nT_reach = t_1 + H -1 =21\n\nt_1=10, 10 + H -1 =21, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions at turn 10 to 10 + H -1 =10 +11=21? 10 + H -1 =21, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions at t for t=10 to 21? No.\n\nThe sequence is actions a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0, action at t_1\n\nt=1, action at t_1+1\n\n...\n\nt=H-1, action at t_1 + H -1\n\nPosition at turn t_1 + H -1 is y_{t_1 + H -1}, which is 9.\n\nHere t_1 + H -1 =21, so actions from t=0 to H-1, at times 10 to 21? t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =21, t_1=10, so 10 + H -1 =21, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nThen actions at t_1 + t for t=0 to 11: so turn 10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21.\n\nBut position at turn 21 is y21=9.\n\nThe actions include a21, which is chosen, but since we are at y=9, we can do S or whatever, no issue.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 12 actions.\n\nBut in the path to y=4 at turn 15, we can use fewer actions if we go directly.\n\nBut we have to use 5 actions from turn 10 to 14 to get to y15=4.\n\nSince we start at y=1, need to increase to 4, net +3.\n\nWe can do it in 3 U and 2 S, for example, or 3 U, 1 D, 1 S, etc., but since we want to minimize extra actions, but here we have to take the actions anyway.\n\nIn terms of time, from turn 10 to 15 is fixed, 5 actions.\n\nSimilarly from turn 16 to 21, 5 actions to go from y=4 to y=9.\n\nBut turn 16 to 21: actions at turn 16,17,18,19,20 to set y21.\n\ny16=4\n\ny17=5 (U)\n\ny18=6 (U)\n\ny19=7 (U)\n\ny20=8 (U)\n\ny21=9 (U)\n\n5 actions.\n\nAnd at turn 15, we have action S, to keep y=4.\n\nNow, from turn 10 to 14, to get to y15=4.\n\ny10=1\n\nActions: we need y15=4, so in 5 actions, net +3.\n\nFor example, we can do U,U,U,S,S or U,U,S,U,S, etc.\n\nAs long as by turn 15, y=4.\n\nAnd during turn 10 to 14, we are moving on freeways.\n\ny from 1 to 4, all freeways 1 to 4, which are always safe, as established.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nFor example, one way: at turn 10, y=1, action U to y=2 at turn 11.\n\nTurn 11, y=2, U to y=3 at turn 12.\n\nTurn 12, y=3, U to y=4 at turn 13.\n\nNow y13=4.\n\nBut we need y15=4.\n\nAt turn 13, y=4.\n\nThen at turn 13, we can do S or D or U.\n\nBut we need y15=4.\n\nIf we do S at turn 13, y14=4.\n\nThen at turn 14, if S, y15=4.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 13, we do D, y14=3, then need to go up later.\n\nBut since freeways safe, we can do anything, but to minimize actions or just for simplicity, we can stay at y=4 from turn 13 to 15.\n\nTurn 13: y=4, action S, to y=4 at turn 14.\n\nTurn 14: y=4, action S, to y=4 at turn 15.\n\nThen turn 15: y=4, action S (to keep for y16=4), but in the sequence, at turn 15, action to set y16.\n\nIn this case, at turn 15, we do S, so y16=4.\n\nThen turn 16: y=4, action U to y=5 at turn 17.\n\nAnd so on as before.\n\nWe could go up faster, but since we need to wait until after turn 16 to go up, it doesn't help to be higher earlier.\n\nFor example, if at turn 13, y=4, we do U to y=5 at turn 14.\n\nBut at turn 14, y=5, which is freeway 5, T=14, ΔT=4, safe as before.\n\nThen at turn 14, if we do D, to y=4 at turn 15? Action at turn 14: if D, y15=4.\n\nBut then at turn 15, y=4, safe.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut we were at y=5 at turn 14, which is safe, but then we moved down to y=4 at turn 15.\n\nCompared to staying at y=4, we have an extra move.\n\nBut in terms of time, it doesn't change, since we reach y=9 at turn 21 still.\n\nAnd we have an extra D action, which might not be necessary.\n\nSo better to stay at y=4 from turn 13 to 16.\n\nSimilarly, we can reach y=4 earlier.\n\nFor example: turn 10: y=1, U to y=2 at turn 11.\n\nTurn 11: y=2, U to y=3 at turn 12.\n\nTurn 12: y=3, U to y=4 at turn 13.\n\nThen turn 13: S, y=4 at turn 14.\n\nTurn 14: S, y=4 at turn 15.\n\nTurn 15: S, y=4 at turn 16.\n\nThen turn 16: U to y=5 at turn 17.\n\nTurn 17: U to y=6 at turn 18.\n\nTurn 18: U to y=7 at turn 19.\n\nTurn 19: U to y=8 at turn 20.\n\nTurn 20: U to y=9 at turn 21.\n\nAt turn 21, y=9.\n\nNow, check the actions:\n\nAt each turn, we need to ensure no collision.\n\nTurn 10: y=1, freeway 1, safe. Action U.\n\nTurn 11: y=2, freeway 2, safe. Action U.\n\nTurn 12: y=3, freeway 3, safe. Action U.\n\nTurn 13: y=4, freeway 4, safe. Action S.\n\nTurn 14: y=4, freeway 4, safe. Action S.\n\nTurn 15: y=4, freeway 4, safe. Action S. (to stay at y=4 for turn 16)\n\nTurn 16: y=4, freeway 4, safe. Action U.\n\nTurn 17: y=5, freeway 5, T=17, safe as ΔT=7. Action U.\n\nTurn 18: y=6, freeway 6, T=18, safe. Action U.\n\nTurn 19: y=7, freeway 7, T=19, safe. Action U.\n\nTurn 20: y=8, freeway 8, T=20, safe. Action U.\n\nTurn 21: y=9, no car, safe. We need to output action at turn 21, can be S or U, but since y=9, if U, y=10 not possible, y<=9, so must be S or D, but D to 8 not good. Since y=9, and we are at target, we can do S.\n\nAction S to stay at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have action at turn 21.\n\nNow, H=12, since actions from turn 10 to 21, 12 actions.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer turns?\n\nEarlier we thought T_reach=21 is minimal.\n\nBut let's think if we can be at y=9 earlier by using y=0 or something.\n\nFor example, at turn 15 and 16, instead of being on y=1-4, we could be on y=0, but y=0 is safe.\n\nBut y=0 is lower, so it might take more to go up.\n\nFor example, at turn 15, y=0, then to y=9, need 9 steps, even worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nWe could go up to y=5-8 before turn 15, but then at turn 15, we need to move down to y<=4.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up quickly to y=8 by some turn, but then at turn 15, if we are at y=8, we need to move down to avoid.\n\nBut let's see the timing.\n\nTurn 10: y=1\n\nIf we go all up: turn 10 U, y11=2\n\n11 U, y12=3\n\n12 U, y13=4\n\n13 U, y14=5\n\n14 U, y15=6\n\nBut at turn 15, y=6, unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, at turn 14, we are at y=5 (if we go up), then at turn 14, instead of U, we can do D to y=4 at turn 15.\n\nThen y15=4, safe.\n\nThen at turn 15, we need to set y16.\n\nSince y15=4, to have y16<=4, we do S or D.\n\nDo S, y16=4.\n\nThen from y16=4, we need to go to y=9.\n\nAs before, min at turn 21.\n\nAfter y15=4, at turn 15, if we do U, y16=5, but at turn 16, T=16, if y=5, unsafe, so we cannot do U at turn 15 if it leads to y=5 at turn 16.\n\ny16 must be <=4, so we must not do U at turn 15 if y15=4.\n\nIf y15=3, we could do U to y16=4.\n\nBut in this case, with the path: turn 10 U, y11=2\n\n11 U, y12=3\n\n12 U, y13=4\n\n13 U, y14=5\n\nNow at turn 14, y=5, T=14, safe (ΔT=4, freeway 5 safe).\n\nAction: instead of U, do D, to y=4 at turn 15.\n\nThen turn 15: y=4, action S, to y=4 at turn 16. (since we need y16<=4)\n\nThen turn 16: U to y=5 at turn 17\n\n17 U to y=6 at 18\n\n18 U to y=7 at 19\n\n19 U to y=8 at 20\n\n20 U to y=9 at 21\n\nSame as before, T_reach=21.\n\nWe reached y=5 at turn 14, but then moved down, so wasted a move.\n\nWorse than staying at y=4 from turn 13.\n\nIn the first plan, we reached y=4 at turn 13 and stayed.\n\nSo better not to go up and down.\n\nThus, minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nH=12, sequence of actions.\n\nTurn 10 to 21.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to specify actions.\n\nIn the first plan:\n\nTurn 10: U (to y=2 at t11)\n\nTurn 11: U (to y=3 at t12)\n\nTurn 12: U (to y=4 at t13)\n\nTurn 13: S (stay y=4 at t14)\n\nTurn 14: S (stay y=4 at t15)\n\nTurn 15: S (stay y=4 at t16)\n\nTurn 16: U (to y=5 at t17)\n\nTurn 17: U (to y=6 at t18)\n\nTurn 18: U (to y=7 at t19)\n\nTurn 19: U (to y=8 at t20)\n\nTurn 20: U (to y=9 at t21)\n\nTurn 21: S (stay at y=9, but position at turn 21 is already 9, action doesn't change)\n\nIn the sequence, we have to include action at turn 21.\n\nSince y=9, we can do S.\n\nNow, for freeways, during turn 10-12, we are on y=1,2,3, all safe.\n\nTurn 13-16: y=4, safe.\n\nTurn 17: y=5, T=17>16, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nAt turn 14, y=4, T=14, freeway 4, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we reach at turn 20.\n\ny20=9.\n\nThen y20=9.\n\nFrom turn 16, y16 <=4, to y20=9.\n\ny20 = y16 + Δy16 + Δy17 + Δy18 + Δy19\n\n<= y16 +4 <=8\n\nBut we need y20=9, so <=8 <9, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, turn 19: y19<= y16 +3 <=7<9, impossible.\n\nTurn 18: y18<= y16 +2 <=6<9, impossible.\n\nSo indeed, turn 21 is the earliest possible.\n\nThus minimal H=12.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have 12 actions.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,1), and we need to reach (0,9).\n\nIn the action sequence, for turn t_1=10.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's list the turns properly.\n\nThe sequence is for actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=12, so actions at turn 10 to 21.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nBut at turn 21, action S is fine.\n\nWe could have different actions in the beginning, but this is one way.\n\nTo save actions, but we have to take the turns, so H is fixed.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 15, we are at y=4, but we could be at y=3 or lower, but that would require more up moves later, worse.\n\nSimilarly, in the beginning, we could have S or D, but that delays reaching y=4, so not better.\n\nThus, this should be minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 5-8 at other times.\n\nFor example, at turn 17, y=5, T=17, ΔT=7, car3: low=-41+42=1, high=-30+42=12, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnd for freeway 1-4, always safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 12.\n\nNow, the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) is 12. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on freeways 5-8 at turns 15 and 16, when cars on those freeways cover position \\(x = 0\\).\n\n- Freeways 1-4 are always safe, as no car covers \\(x = 0\\) at any turn.\n- Freeways 5-8 are unsafe at turns 15 and 16 due to the third car (head \\(-30\\), tail \\(-41\\), direction right, speed 6) covering \\(x = 0\\) at those times.\n\nThe sequence involves:\n- Moving up to \\(y = 4\\) by turn 13 using actions U at turns 10, 11, and 12.\n- Staying at \\(y = 4\\) from turns 13 to 16 using actions S at turns 13, 14, and 15 to avoid freeways 5-8 during turns 15 and 16.\n- Moving up from \\(y = 4\\) to \\(y = 9\\) from turn 17 onwards using actions U at turns 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.\n- Staying at \\(y = 9\\) at turn 21 with action S.\n\nThe actions are safe because:\n- Turns 10-12: Player is on freeways 1-3 (safe).\n- Turns 13-16: Player is on freeway 4 (safe).\n- Turns 17-20: Player is on freeways 5-8, but after turn 16, these freeways are safe as the car no longer covers \\(x = 0\\).\n- Turn 21: Player is on \\(y = 9\\) (no cars, safe).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: S }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t=11, and I'm at y=2. The cars are all moving right with speed 6, and they have given positions at t=11.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at any future turn T. Since all cars are moving right, their spans shift to the right by s*(T-t1) for each car. Speed s=6 for all, and t1=11.\n\nSo for any turn T > 11, the position of a car that had span [h, τ] at t=11 (but for right-moving, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). Direction is right, so head is the front, I think. For right-moving, span at t is [τ, h]? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] and at T, it becomes [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)].\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed). For example, on freeway 1: (18,7,right,6) and (-48,-59,right,6).\n\nSince direction is right, for the first car, head is 18, tail is 7? But for right-moving, head should be greater than tail if it's moving right? 18 > 7, so head at right, tail at left, so span should be from τ to h, so [7,18] at t=11.\n\nSimilarly, for (-48,-59,right,6), head -48, tail -59? -48 > -59, so tail is -59, head is -48, so span [-59, -48] at t=11.\n\nBut collision occurs if 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway y_T.\n\nAlso, note that at turn T, when I move, I am on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nThe player position update: at turn t, I am at (0, y_t), and I choose action a_t which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nBut collision is checked at turn T: if I am on freeway y_T at turn T, and for that freeway, if there is a car with 0 in its span at turn T, I collide.\n\nThe note says: if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I don't get collided by cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nSpecifically: \"you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut in this case, since I am changing lanes, at turn T, I am on y_T, not on y_{T+1}, so I only care about cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, the goal is to reach y=9, which is the top, but y=9 is not a freeway; the freeways are from y=1 to y=8, I think. y=0 and y=9 are probably safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is the starting point, and y=9 is the target, so no cars there. Only y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nSo when I'm at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=2 to y=9, so I need to move up through the freeways.\n\nEach action U increases y by 1, D decreases by 1, S stays.\n\ny is vertical, from 0 to 9.\n\nSo to go from 2 to 9, I need to increase y by 7, so minimum 7 moves if I go up directly, but I might have to wait or detour to avoid cars.\n\nBut in this case, since I can only change y by 0 or ±1 per turn, and I start at y=2 at turn t=11.\n\nLet me denote the turns starting from t=11.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, and I choose a_T, which sets y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision is if at turn T, for freeway y_T, if there is a car with 0 in its span at time T.\n\nSince all freeways have cars moving right at speed 6.\n\nNow, let's list the cars for each freeway.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars: (18,7,right,6) and (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nSince right-moving, span at t=11: for first car, head=18, tail=7, so span [7,18]\n\nSecond car: head=-48, tail=-59, so span [-59,-48]\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? It says for freeway 2: (18,7,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6) — same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: same.\n\nFreeway 4: same.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (18,7,right,6), (54,43,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5.\n\nFreeway 7: same.\n\nFreeway 8: same.\n\nAnd freeway 1 to 4 have only two cars each, while 5 to 8 have three each.\n\nBut for freeway 1 to 4, it's identical: two cars at [7,18] and [-59,-48] at t=11.\n\nSimilarly for 5 to 8: three cars at [7,18], [43,54], and [-35,-24]? Let's see: (54,43,right,6) head=54, tail=43, so span [43,54]\n\n(-24,-35,right,6) head=-24, tail=-35, so span [-35,-24]\n\nAnd (18,7,right,6) span [7,18]\n\nSo at t=11, for freeways 1-4: spans [7,18] and [-59,-48]\n\nFor freeways 5-8: spans [7,18], [43,54], [-35,-24]\n\nNow, at any future turn T, since all move right at speed 6, the position shifts by 6*(T-11) to the right.\n\nSo for a car with span [a,b] at t=11, at time T, span is [a + 6(T-11), b + 6(T-11)]\n\nCollision at freeway k at time T if y_T = k and 0 is within the span of some car on that freeway at time T.\n\nThat is, for some car, min <= 0 <= max of its span at T.\n\nSince spans are intervals.\n\nNow, I start at turn t=11, position y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is above, so I need to go up.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is safe, but I'm at y=2, going to y=9, so probably not going down.\n\nBut I might need to go down to avoid cars, but that might take more turns, so likely not minimal.\n\nMinimal turns would be to go up as fast as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nSince I have to cross freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8 to reach y=9 from y=2? y=2 is freeway 2? Freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\ny=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 are the freeways with cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nI start at (0,2), so at turn t=11, I am on freeway y=2.\n\nThen I choose action at t=11 to go to y=3 or stay or down.\n\nBut I need to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\nNow, the position is vertical, and horizontal is the road, but I'm always at x=0, I think, since position is (0, y_t), so I'm fixed at x=0, and y changes.\n\nCars are on the freeways, moving horizontally.\n\nCollision when a car covers x=0 at the time I'm on that freeway.\n\nFor freeway y=2 at time T, if I am on it, and 0 is in some car's span.\n\nNow, for freeway 2, at time T, cars: since freeway 2 has two cars: original spans [7,18] and [-59,-48] at t=11.\n\nAt time T, span1: [7 + 6(T-11), 18 + 6(T-11)]\n\nSpan2: [-59 + 6(T-11), -48 + 6(T-11)]\n\n0 is covered if:\n\nFor span1: 7 + 6(T-11) <= 0 <= 18 + 6(T-11)\n\nOr for span2: -59 + 6(T-11) <= 0 <= -48 + 6(T-11)\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nBut since freeways 1-4 are identical, and 5-8 identical.\n\nNow, I need to find when each freeway is dangerous at time T.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when 0 is covered by some car.\n\nDefine Δt = T - 11, so from turn 11, Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt, for a given freeway, if 0 is in some span.\n\nFor freeway k=1 to 4:\n\nCar 1: span [7 + 6Δt, 18 + 6Δt]\n\n0 in span if 7 + 6Δt <= 0 <= 18 + 6Δt\n\nSince 7+6Δt <=0 implies Δt <= -7/6, which is negative, not possible since Δt >=0, so 7+6Δt >0 for Δt>=0, so 0 < 7+6Δt, so 0 is less than min, so not in [min,max] since min >0.\n\nSimilarly, max=18+6Δt >0, but min >0, so 0 < min, so 0 not in [min,max].\n\nSimilarly, car 2: span [-59 + 6Δt, -48 + 6Δt]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 6Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 6Δt\n\nWhich is 6Δt <= 48 and 6Δt >=59? Let's see:\n\n-59 + 6Δt <= 0 implies 6Δt <= 59, so Δt <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833\n\nAnd 0 <= -48 + 6Δt implies 6Δt >= 48, so Δt >= 8\n\nSo for car 2, 0 in span if 8 <= Δt <= 9.833\n\nSince Δt integer, Δt=8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, car 1 never covers 0 for Δt>=0.\n\nSo for freeways 1-4, dangerous when Δt=8 or 9.\n\nThat is, at time T=11+8=19 or T=11+9=20.\n\nAt T=19 and 20, if I am on freeway 1,2,3, or 4, I collide because car 2 covers x=0.\n\nNow for freeways 5-8.\n\nFreeways 5-8 have three cars: (18,7,right,6) so span [7,18] at t=11\n\n(54,43,right,6) span [43,54]\n\n(-24,-35,right,6) head=-24, tail=-35, so span [-35,-24]\n\nAt time T, with Δt=T-11\n\nSpan1: [7+6Δt, 18+6Δt] min=7+6Δt >0 for Δt>=0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSpan2: [43+6Δt, 54+6Δt] min>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSpan3: [-35+6Δt, -24+6Δt]\n\n0 in span if -35+6Δt <= 0 <= -24+6Δt\n\nWhich is 6Δt <= 24 and 6Δt >=35? \n\n-35+6Δt <=0 implies 6Δt <=35, Δt <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833\n\n0 <= -24+6Δt implies 6Δt >=24, Δt >=4\n\nSo for Δt integer, Δt=4,5\n\nThus for freeways 5-8, dangerous at T=11+4=15 and T=11+5=16.\n\nAlso, car 1 and 2 never cover 0, only car 3 does at Δt=4 and 5.\n\nNow, summarize:\n\nFor freeways 1-4: dangerous at turns T=19 and 20.\n\nFor freeways 5-8: dangerous at turns T=15 and 16.\n\nAt other times, no car covers x=0, so safe to be on those freeways.\n\nBut I need to be on a freeway only when I am at that y position at that turn.\n\nNow, I start at turn t=11, y=2.\n\nFreeway y=2 is part of group 1-4, so dangerous only at T=19,20.\n\nAt t=11, Δt=0, which is not 19 or 20, so at t=11, on y=2, is it dangerous?\n\nAt t=11, Δt=0, for freeway 2, car spans: [7,18] and [-59,-48], min>0 and min<0 but 0 not in between? [-59,-48] min=-59, max=-48, both negative, so 0 > max? -48 <0, so 0 not in [-59,-48], since max=-48<0. Similarly [7,18] min=7>0, 0 not in. So at t=11, on y=2 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for all freeways, at t=11, let's verify.\n\nFor y=2, as above, safe.\n\ny=5: freeway 5, at t=11, spans [7,18], [43,54], [-35,-24]. min all not around 0, [-35,-24] min=-35<0, max=-24<0, so 0>max, not covered. So safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=2 to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nThe path: I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y changes by at most 1 per turn, from y=2 to y=9, minimum 7 upward moves, so minimum 7 turns if I go straight up.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down to avoid dangerous times.\n\nNow, the dangerous times:\n\nFor freeways 1-4 (y=1,2,3,4): dangerous at T=19,20\n\nFor freeways 5-8 (y=5,6,7,8): dangerous at T=15,16\n\nI start at t=11, y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=2 is safe at t=11, as above.\n\nIf I go straight up: at t=11, I can choose U, to go to y=3 at t=12.\n\nOr S to stay at y=2, or D to y=1.\n\nBut going down might not help, since I need to go up eventually.\n\nSimilarly, staying might be useful to wait.\n\nBut let's see the timeline.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=1,2,3,4 at T=19 or 20.\n\nAnd avoid being on y=5,6,7,8 at T=15 or 16.\n\nSince I start at t=11, and T=15,16 are soon, T=19,20 are later.\n\ny=5-8 dangerous at T=15,16, which are only 4 and 5 turns from now (t=11 to t=15 is Δt=4, t=16 is Δt=5).\n\nt=11, Δt=0; t=12, Δt=1; ... t=15, Δt=4; t=16, Δt=5; t=17, Δt=6; t=18, Δt=7; t=19, Δt=8; t=20, Δt=9.\n\nNow, from y=2, I need to get to y=9.\n\nIf I go up every turn, I can be at y=3 at t=12, y=4 at t=13, y=5 at t=14, y=6 at t=15, y=7 at t=16, y=8 at t=17, y=9 at t=18.\n\nAt t=15, y=6, which is freeway 6, part of 5-8, dangerous at T=15 and 16.\n\nT=15 is dangerous for y=5-8.\n\nAt t=15, if I am on y=6, I collide.\n\nSimilarly, at t=16, if I am on y=7, I collide.\n\nIn this path: at t=15, y=6, dangerous, collision.\n\nAt t=16, y=7, dangerous, collision.\n\nSo I cannot go straight up without hitting at t=15 and t=16.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=5,6,7,8 at t=15 and t=16.\n\nSimilarly, later, avoid y=1,2,3,4 at t=19 and t=20.\n\nBut t=19 and 20 are later, so I might be past them or not there yet.\n\nSince I start at t=11, if I go up slowly, I might be on lower freeways at t=19,20.\n\nBut y=1-4 dangerous at t=19,20, so if I am on y=1,2,3,4 at t=19 or 20, I collide.\n\nIn the direct path, I reach y=9 at t=18, before t=19, so I avoid the later danger.\n\nBut the immediate problem is t=15 and 16 for upper freeways.\n\nSo I need to not be on y=5,6,7,8 at t=15 or t=16.\n\nThat means, at t=15, I should not be on y=5-8, so I must be on y=0,1,2,3,4 or 9.\n\nBut y=9 is target, probably not yet.\n\nSimilarly at t=16.\n\nNow, y=0,1,2,3,4 are safe at t=15 and 16? Not necessarily.\n\ny=1-4 are dangerous only at t=19,20, so at t=15,16, they are safe.\n\ny=0 is always safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\nSo at t=15 and t=16, I need to be on y=0,1,2,3,4 or 9 to avoid collision.\n\nSince I'm going up, I might be on lower y.\n\nSimilarly, for t=19 and 20, I need to not be on y=1-4, so be on y=0,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=5-8 are dangerous at t=15,16, but not at t=19,20, since dangerous only at those specific times.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI start at t=11, y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9 with min turns.\n\nIf I go up directly, I hit at t=15 and t=16.\n\nSo I need to delay or something.\n\nPerhaps stay at lower y until after t=16.\n\nt=16 is Δt=5.\n\nAfter t=16, upper freeways are safe.\n\nt=17 and later, y=5-8 safe.\n\nSimilarly, lower freeways dangerous only at t=19,20.\n\nNow, from t=11, if I stay at y=2 for a few turns.\n\nBut y=2 is safe except at t=19,20.\n\nAt t=11, y=2 safe.\n\nI can choose to stay or move.\n\nIf I stay at y=2 for some turns, then go up.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on y=5-8 at t=15 and 16.\n\nt=15 is in 4 turns, t=16 in 5 turns.\n\nFrom t=11, after k turns, time is t=11+k.\n\nI need at time t=11+k, y_{11+k} not in {5,6,7,8} for k=4 and k=5, since t=15 =11+4, t=16=11+5.\n\nAlso, not in {1,2,3,4} for k=8 and k=9, t=19=11+8, t=20=11+9.\n\nBut the target is y=9, which I can reach.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns from start.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=11 to t=11+H-1, and y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nt1=11, so at turn t=11 + H -1, y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=11 to t=11+H-2, I think.\n\nDefine: I start at turn t=11, after action a_t for t=11 to t=11+H-1, I reach y=9 at turn t=11+H-1.\n\nThe position at turn t is before action, I think.\n\nLet's see the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with a_t determining Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, I am at y_t, I choose a_t, then at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t: if at that turn, on freeway y_t, collision if 0 in span.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t, I am at y_t, and I might collide.\n\nThen I choose a_t, go to y_{t+1} at next turn.\n\nNow, at start, turn t=11, I am at y=2.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nThen H = T - 10? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t=11, I am at y=2.\n\nAfter first action a_{11}, at turn t=12, I am at y_{12}.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t=11+H, at y_{11+H}.\n\nAnd I want y_{11+H} =9.\n\nt=11+H is the turn when I reach y=9.\n\nNumber of turns H: from t=11 to t=11+H, with actions at t=11 to t=11+H-1? Let's clarify.\n\nSuppose I start at turn t=11, position y_{11}=2.\n\nI take action a_{11}, which sets y_{12}.\n\nThen at turn t=12, I am at y_{12}, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, I am at turn t=11+k, position y_{11+k}.\n\nI want for some k, y_{11+k} =9.\n\nThe number of actions is k, and I reach at turn t=11+k.\n\nIn the answer, it should be the sequence of actions from t=11 to t=11+k-1, and at t=11+k, I am at y=9.\n\nThe minimal k such that I can be at y=9 at t=11+k.\n\nk is the number of moves, H in the problem.\n\nProblem says: sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and at turn t1 + H -1, position (0,9).\n\nt1=11, so actions at t=11 + t for t=0 to H-1, so actions at t=11 to t=11+H-1.\n\nThen at turn (t1 + H -1) = 11 + H -1 = 10 + H, position y=9.\n\nTurn index: at turn 11, before any action, y=2.\n\nAfter action a_{11}, at turn 12, y_{12}.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{11+H-1}, at turn (11+H-1) +1? No.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter choosing a_t, y_{t+1} is set for turn t+1.\n\nSo at turn t, I am at y_t, choose a_t, then at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision checked at each turn t based on y_t.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn T.\n\nThen at turn T, y_T=9, which is safe.\n\nThe actions are from t=11 to t=T-1, I think.\n\nSet T = turn when I reach y=9.\n\nThen at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nThe actions taken at turns t=11 to t=T-1 determine the path from y_{11} to y_T.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=11 to t=T-1, that's (T-1) - 11 + 1 = T-11 actions? Let's index.\n\nActions at times: t=11,12,13,..., up to the action before reaching.\n\nIf I reach at turn T, then the last action was at turn T-1, which set y_T from y_{T-1}.\n\nSo actions from t=11 to t=T-1, total of (T-1) - 11 + 1 = T - 11 actions.\n\nH = number of actions = T - 11.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H -1 = 11 + (T-11) -1 + ? t1 + H -1 = 11 + (T-11) -1 = T -1? Messy.\n\nFrom the problem: sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so actions at t1 + 0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen at turn (t1 + H -1), position (0,9).\n\nSo for t1=11, actions at t=11,12,...,11+H-1.\n\nAt turn 11+H-1, y=9.\n\nThat means, at turn 11+H-1, I am at y=9.\n\nBefore that, at turn 11+H-2, I was at y_{11+H-2}, chose a_{11+H-2} to go to y=9 at turn 11+H-1.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 11, I am at y=2, choose a_{11}, go to y_{12} at turn 12, etc.\n\nH is the number of actions.\n\nI need to minimize H.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI need to avoid being on dangerous freeways at dangerous times.\n\nDangerous times:\n\n- For y=5,6,7,8: dangerous at t=15 and t=16\n\n- For y=1,2,3,4: dangerous at t=19 and t=20\n\nAt other times, all freeways are safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nI start at t=11, y=2.\n\nIf I go straight up as before: y_t = 2 + (t-11) for t from 11 to 18.\n\nAt t=11, y=2\n\nt=12, y=3\n\nt=13, y=4\n\nt=14, y=5\n\nt=15, y=6 → dangerous, collide\n\nI need to not be on y=5-8 at t=15 and t=16.\n\nSo at t=15, I should be on y <=4 or y=9.\n\nSimilarly at t=16, y<=4 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 might not be reachable yet.\n\nSince I start at y=2 at t=11, I can stay or go down to lower y.\n\nBut y=0 or 1 might be safe.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=1 or stay at y=2 until after t=16.\n\nt=16 is at Δt=5, t=11+5=16.\n\nAfter t=16, upper freeways safe.\n\nSo I can be on y=5-8 after t=16.\n\nt=17 and later.\n\nNow, t=19 and 20 are dangerous for lower, but if I am on upper or target, ok.\n\nMinimal H: I need to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nBut I have to spend time avoiding the danger zone.\n\nI can stay at y=2 for a few turns.\n\nAt t=11, y=2, safe.\n\nI choose S (stay), then at t=12, still y=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can stay at y=2 until, say, t=14 or something.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut let's see the times.\n\nI need to not be on y=5-8 at t=15 and t=16.\n\nSo at t=15, I must be on y=0,1,2,3,4\n\nAt t=16, same.\n\nThen after that, I can go up.\n\nAlso, for later, at t=19 and 20, I need to not be on y=1-4, so on y=0,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSince I am going to y=9, I can be on y=9 by then.\n\nNow, let's find the earliest I can reach y=9.\n\nSuppose I stay at y=2 until t=16.\n\nAt t=11, y=2\n\nt=12, y=2 if S\n\nt=13, y=2 if S\n\nt=14, y=2 if S\n\nt=15, y=2, safe since y=2 not dangerous at t=15 (dangerous only at t=19,20)\n\nt=16, y=2, safe\n\nThen at t=16, I am at y=2, I can start going up.\n\nAt t=16, choose U, go to y=3 at t=17\n\nt=17, at y=3, choose U, go to y=4 at t=18\n\nt=18, at y=4, choose U, go to y=5 at t=19\n\nt=19, at y=5, but t=19 is dangerous for y=1-4? y=5 is not in 1-4, y=5 is upper.\n\ny=1-4 dangerous at t=19,20.\n\ny=5 is freeway 5, which is upper, dangerous at t=15,16, but t=19 is safe for y=5.\n\nAt t=19, y=5: freeway 5, dangerous only at t=15,16, so at t=19, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn this path:\n\nt=17: y=3\n\nt=18: y=4\n\nt=19: y=5\n\nt=20: y=6? Let's continue.\n\nFrom t=16, y=2, after U to y=3 at t=17\n\nt=17, y=3, choose U to y=4 at t=18\n\nt=18, y=4, choose U to y=5 at t=19\n\nt=19, y=5, now at t=19, y=5 is safe, since upper dangerous only at t=15,16.\n\nThen I can choose U to y=6 at t=20\n\nt=20, y=6, freeway 6, which is upper, dangerous at t=15,16, not at t=20, so safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at t=21\n\nU to y=8 at t=22\n\nU to y=9 at t=23\n\nSo at t=23, y=9.\n\nNow, actions: from t=11 to t=22? Let's list the turns when actions are taken.\n\nActions at t=11 to t=22, since at t=22, choose a_{22} to go to y=9 at t=23.\n\nBut at which turn do I reach y=9? At turn t=23.\n\nt=11+H-1 =23, so H-1=12, H=13.\n\nActions from t=11 to t=11+H-1, at t=11+H-1, y=9.\n\nSo t=11+H-1 =23, so 11+H-1=23, H-1=12, H=13.\n\nNumber of actions H=13.\n\nBut is this minimal? I stayed too long.\n\nI started going up at t=16.\n\nBut I could go up earlier but avoid the danger times.\n\nFor example, at t=14, if I am on y=4, safe.\n\nAt t=15, I need to not be on y=5-8, so I can be on y=4 or lower.\n\nSimilarly at t=16.\n\nSo suppose at t=11, I go up to y=3.\n\nt=11: at y=2, choose U, to y=3 at t=12\n\nt=12: at y=3, I can choose S or U or D.\n\nIf I go U to y=4 at t=13\n\nt=13: y=4, safe\n\nt=14: I can go to y=5 or stay.\n\nBut at t=15, I cannot be on y=5-8.\n\nSo at t=14, if I go to y=5, at t=15 I am on y=5, dangerous.\n\nIf I stay at y=4 at t=14, then at t=15 I am on y=4, which is safe since lower dangerous only later.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo at t=14, I should not go to y=5.\n\nI need to be at y<=4 at t=15 and t=16.\n\nSo at t=14, I can be at y=4 or lower.\n\nThen after t=16, I can go up.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 faster, I should be as high as possible before t=15, but not enter danger zone.\n\nFor example, at t=11: y=2, U to y=3 at t=12\n\nt=12: y=3, U to y=4 at t=13\n\nt=13: y=4, now at t=13, safe.\n\nI need to stay at y=4 until after t=16? But at t=15 and t=16, I need to be at y<=4.\n\nAt t=14: I am at y=4 (if I stay from t=13)\n\nAt t=13, y=4, choose a_{13}.\n\nIf I choose S, stay at y=4 for t=14.\n\nAt t=14, y=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=14, choose S again, stay at y=4 for t=15.\n\nt=15, y=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=15, choose S, stay for t=16, y=4 at t=16, safe.\n\nThen after that, go up.\n\nAt t=16, y=4, choose U to y=5 at t=17\n\nt=17, y=5, U to y=6 at t=18\n\nt=18, y=6, U to y=7 at t=19\n\nt=19, y=7, but t=19 is dangerous for y=1-4, but y=7 is upper, not lower, so safe? y=1-4 dangerous at t=19,20, y=7 is not in 1-4, so safe.\n\nThen U to y=8 at t=20\n\nt=20, y=8, safe? Upper dangerous at t=15,16, not t=20.\n\nThen U to y=9 at t=21.\n\nSo at t=21, y=9.\n\nNow, actions: from t=11 to t=20.\n\nt=11: U to y=3 at t=12\n\nt=12: U to y=4 at t=13\n\nt=13: S to stay y=4 at t=14\n\nt=14: S to stay y=4 at t=15\n\nt=15: S to stay y=4 at t=16\n\nt=16: U to y=5 at t=17\n\nt=17: U to y=6 at t=18\n\nt=18: U to y=7 at t=19\n\nt=19: U to y=8 at t=20\n\nt=20: U to y=9 at t=21\n\nActions at t=11 to t=20, that's 10 actions.\n\nAt turn t=11+H-1=21, so 11+H-1=21, H-1=10, H=11.\n\nBetter than before.\n\nI reached at t=21 with H=11.\n\nIn the first slow path, I reached at t=23 with H=13.\n\nNow, can I do better?\n\nI stayed at y=4 from t=13 to t=16, three turns staying.\n\nBut I could be at higher y, but y=4 is the highest safe at that time.\n\ny=5-8 dangerous at t=15,16.\n\nBut at t=14, I could be at y=4.\n\nWhat about going to y=5 before or after.\n\nSuppose I go up faster but then down to avoid, but going down might waste turns.\n\nFor example, at t=11: U to y=3 at t=12\n\nt=12: U to y=4 at t=13\n\nt=13: U to y=5 at t=14\n\nBut at t=14, y=5, safe? At t=14, Δt=3, for upper freeways, dangerous at t=15,16, not t=14, so y=5 at t=14 safe.\n\nThen at t=14, I am at y=5.\n\nNow, at t=15, I need to not be on y=5-8, so I must move away.\n\nI can go down to y=4 or up to y=6, but y=6 also dangerous at t=15.\n\nSo I need to go to y=4 or lower.\n\nSimilarly at t=16.\n\nBut if I go to y=4 at t=15, then I have to come back up, wasting turns.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=13: U to y=5 at t=14\n\nt=14: at y=5, I can choose D to go to y=4 at t=15\n\nt=15: at y=4, safe (since not upper and not dangerous time for lower)\n\nThen at t=15, I need to stay or something.\n\nAt t=16, I still need to not be on upper, so I can stay at y=4.\n\nt=15: y=4, choose S to stay at y=4 for t=16? Or D to y=3, but better to stay high.\n\nt=15: choose S, to stay y=4 at t=16\n\nt=16: y=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=16, U to y=5 at t=17\n\nAnd so on, same as before.\n\nBut I reached y=5 earlier at t=14, but then went down to y=4 at t=15, so I wasted a move going up and down.\n\nCompared to staying at y=4 directly.\n\nIn the previous path, I was at y=4 from t=13 to t=16 without going to y=5.\n\nSo better not to go up to y=5 early.\n\nSimilarly, I could go to y=3 or something, but y=4 is higher, better.\n\nNow, another idea: go down to y=0 or something, but that would take more turns to go up.\n\nFor example, from y=2 go down to y=0, then up, but longer.\n\nNot minimal.\n\nSo staying at y=4 during the danger period seems good.\n\nBut in the path above, I used actions to go from y=2 to y=4 in two moves: t=11 U to y=3, t=12 U to y=4.\n\nThen stayed at y=4 from t=13 to t=16 with S actions.\n\nThen from t=16 U to y=5, t=17 U to y=6, t=18 U to y=7, t=19 U to y=8, t=20 U to y=9 at t=21.\n\nNow, at t=19, y=7, and t=19 is dangerous for y=1-4, but y=7 is not affected.\n\nSimilarly t=20, y=8, safe.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on y=1-4 at t=19 and t=20, which I am not, since I am on y=7 and y=8.\n\nNow, can I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, after t=16, I go up, but to reach y=9 faster.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=16, I go up each turn: t=16 U to y=5 at t=17, t=17 U to y=6 at t=18, t=18 U to y=7 at t=19, t=19 U to y=8 at t=20, t=20 U to y=9 at t=21.\n\nSame as above.\n\nBut at t=18, y=7, which is fine.\n\nt=19, y=8? Let's list:\n\nAt t=16: position y=4, choose a_{16}=U, to y=5 at t=17\n\nt=17: y=5, choose U to y=6 at t=18\n\nt=18: y=6, choose U to y=7 at t=19\n\nt=19: y=7, choose U to y=8 at t=20\n\nt=20: y=8, choose U to y=9 at t=21\n\nSo at t=21, y=9.\n\nNow, the actions: from t=11 to t=20, as above.\n\nBut I need to include the actions before.\n\nt=11: U\n\nt=12: U\n\nt=13: S\n\nt=14: S\n\nt=15: S\n\nt=16: U\n\nt=17: U\n\nt=18: U\n\nt=19: U\n\nt=20: U\n\nActions at t=11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20. That's 10 actions.\n\nH=10? t from 11 to 20 inclusive is 10 turns.\n\nt=11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20: 10 actions.\n\nAt turn t=11+H-1 = turn when y=9.\n\nt=11+H-1 =21, so H-1=10, H=11? 11+H-1=21, H=11.\n\nNumber of actions H=11.\n\nt=11 to t=20 is 10 actions? t=11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20: that's 10 actions.\n\nIndex: t=11 is first action, t=20 is tenth action.\n\nThen after t=20 action, at turn t=21, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but I think I can save one turn.\n\nNotice that at t=16, after the danger, I can be at higher y earlier.\n\nBut from t=11, I need to be at y<=4 at t=15 and t=16.\n\nAt t=14, I can be at y=4.\n\nIf I can be at y=4 earlier, but I started from y=2 at t=11.\n\nt=11: y=2, U to y=3 at t=12\n\nt=12: y=3, U to y=4 at t=13\n\nSo at t=13, y=4.\n\nI need to stay at y=4 until t=16.\n\nAt t=16, y=4.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut to reach y=9, from y=4, I need 5 up moves: to y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo minimum from t=17 to t=21, y=5 to9.\n\nAt t=17 y=5, t=18 y=6, t=19 y=7, t=20 y=8, t=21 y=9.\n\nCannot be faster.\n\nUnless I start from higher.\n\nBut at t=16, I am at y=4, cannot be higher because I cannot be on y=5 at t=16.\n\nt=16 is danger time for upper.\n\nSo I think 11 actions is the best so far.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can be at y=4 at t=12 or something.\n\nt=11: y=2, if I go U to y=3 at t=12\n\nAt t=12, y=3, if I go U to y=4 at t=13, same as before.\n\nIf at t=11 I go U, to y=3 at t=12, then at t=12, if I go U to y=4 at t=13, cannot be faster.\n\nGo down? No.\n\nSo I think H=11 is achievable.\n\nBut in the actions, I have three S at t=13,14,15.\n\nt=13,14,15: S to stay at y=4.\n\nNow, for the later danger, at t=19 and 20, I am on y=7 and y=8, which are safe.\n\ny=7 at t=19 is freeway 7, which is upper, dangerous only at t=15,16, so t=19 safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, but I need to make sure that at each turn, no collision.\n\nIn this path:\n\nt=11: y=2, freeway 2, at Δt=0, safe as before.\n\nAction a11=U\n\nt=12: y=3, freeway 3, which is lower group, dangerous at t=19,20, not now. At t=12, Δt=1, for freeway 3, cars: [7+6*1,18+6*1]= [13,24] and [-59+6,-48+6]=[-53,-42], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction a12=U\n\nt=13: y=4, freeway 4, similar, spans [7+12,18+12]=[19,30]? Δt=2, T=13, t1=11, Δt=2.\n\n[7+12=19, 18+12=30] and [-59+12=-47, -48+12=-36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction a13=S\n\nt=14: y=4, freeway 4, Δt=3, [7+18=25,18+18=36], [-59+18=-41,-48+18=-30], safe.\n\nAction a14=S\n\nt=15: y=4, freeway 4, Δt=4, [7+24=31,18+24=42], [-59+24=-35,-48+24=-24], 0 not in, safe. Also, not dangerous time for lower, which is t=19,20.\n\nAction a15=S\n\nt=16: y=4, freeway 4, Δt=5, [7+30=37,18+30=48], [-59+30=-29,-48+30=-18], safe.\n\nAction a16=U\n\nt=17: y=5, freeway 5, which is upper group. At Δt=6, T=17.\n\nFor freeway 5, cars: at t=11, spans [7,18], [43,54], [-35,-24]\n\nAt T=17, Δt=6, spans: [7+36=43,18+36=54], [43+36=79,54+36=90], [-35+36=1, -24+36=12]\n\nNow, 0 in span? [43,54] min=43>0, [79,90] min>0, [1,12] min=1>0, max=12>0, so 0 not in any, safe. And dangerous only at t=15,16, passed.\n\nAction a17=U\n\nt=18: y=6, freeway 6, similar, spans shifted, all min>0, safe.\n\nAction a18=U\n\nt=19: y=7, freeway 7, Δt=8, spans: [7+48=55,18+48=66], [43+48=91,54+48=102], [-35+48=13, -24+48=24], all min>0, safe.\n\nAction a19=U\n\nt=20: y=8, freeway 8, similar, safe.\n\nAction a20=U\n\nt=21: y=9, safe, reached.\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, actions: t=11: U, t=12: U, t=13: S, t=14: S, t=15: S, t=16: U, t=17: U, t=18: U, t=19: U, t=20: U\n\nThat's 10 actions, but H should be number of actions, and at turn t=11+H-1=21, so H=11.\n\nt=11 to t=20 is 10 actions, H=10? Let's see: actions from t=11 to t=20 inclusive, 10 actions.\n\nAfter these actions, at turn t=21, y=9.\n\nAnd turn t=11+H-1 =21.\n\nSo 11 + H - 1 = 21, thus H - 1 = 10, H=11.\n\nYes.\n\nBut I can reduce H?\n\nSuppose I go to y=4 faster? Cannot.\n\nOr, after t=16, go up, but I need 5 moves to y=9.\n\nUnless I am at higher y at t=16.\n\nBut at t=16, I need to be at y<=4 to be safe.\n\ny=4 is the highest possible at t=16 without danger.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 before t=19, but with avoiding.\n\nFor example, if I can reach y=9 by t=18, but at t=15 and t=16, I need to not be on y=5-8.\n\nIf I reach y=9 at t=18, that means at t=17, I am at y=8, choose U to y=9 at t=18.\n\nBut at t=17, y=8, which is after t=16, so safe.\n\nBut at t=15 and t=16, I need to be below.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=18, I need to be at y=8 at t=17, y=7 at t=16, but at t=16, y=7 is dangerous, since t=16 danger for upper.\n\nt=16: if y=7, freeway 7, dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, at t=15, if I am on y=6, dangerous.\n\nSo to reach y=9 at t=18, I would have to be on y=6 at t=15 or y=7 at t=16, both dangerous.\n\nCannot.\n\nSimilarly, reach at t=19: at t=18 y=8, U to y=9 at t=19.\n\nAt t=18, y=8 safe.\n\nBut at t=15 and t=16, need to be safe.\n\nSuppose at t=15, I am at y=4, safe.\n\nt=16, at y=4, safe.\n\nThen from t=16, go up: t=16 U to y=5 at t=17\n\nt=17 U to y=6 at t=18\n\nt=18 U to y=7 at t=19\n\nt=19 U to y=8 at t=20\n\nt=20 U to y=9 at t=21\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf from t=16 y=4, U to y=5 at t=17\n\nThen at t=17, U to y=6 at t=18\n\nBut to reach y=9 at t=19, I need to be at y=8 at t=18, but at t=17 I am at y=5, U to y=6 at t=18, not y=8.\n\nCannot jump.\n\nSo minimum from y=4 to y=9 takes 5 turns: to y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nStarting from t=17 y=5 to t=21 y=9.\n\nCannot be faster.\n\nPerhaps start going up later but with less waiting.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=1 or something to wait, but that would take more turns to go up, worse.\n\nFor example, from y=2 go down to y=1 at t=12, then stay, but y=1 is lower, but I need to go up later, more steps.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo H=11 seems minimal.\n\nBut let's see if I can have fewer S actions.\n\nFor example, instead of staying at y=4, I could be at y=3 or something, but that might not help.\n\nSuppose at t=11: S, stay at y=2\n\nt=12: S, stay y=2\n\nt=13: U to y=3? But then I need to reach y=4 later.\n\nNot better.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=5 after t=16 but with fewer up moves? No.\n\nAnother thought: the lower freeways are dangerous at t=19,20, but in my path, I am on y=7 and y=8 at those times, safe.\n\nBut if I could be at y=9 before t=19, but I cannot because of the upper danger.\n\nt=18 is possible only if I can be on y=8 at t=17, but at t=17, I can be on y=5 if I start from y=4 at t=16, etc.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I can cross the upper freeways before t=15.\n\nFor example, reach y=9 by t=14 or something.\n\nBut from y=2 at t=11, to y=9, minimum 7 up moves, so at t=18 earliest? t=11 y=2, after 7 U, at t=18 y=9.\n\nt=11: after action U, y=3 at t=12\n\nt=12: U, y=4 at t=13\n\nt=13: U, y=5 at t=14\n\nt=14: U, y=6 at t=15\n\nt=15: U, y=7 at t=16\n\nBut at t=15, y=6, dangerous! Collide.\n\nIf I go faster: from t=11 U to y=3 at t=12\n\nt=12 U to y=4 at t=13\n\nt=13 U to y=5 at t=14\n\nNow at t=14, y=5, safe since t=14 not danger.\n\nThen to reach y=9 at t=18, I need to go up three more times: to y=6 at t=15, but t=15 y=6 dangerous.\n\nIf at t=14, I go U to y=6 at t=15, dangerous.\n\nOr if I stay at y=5 at t=15, but t=15 y=5 dangerous.\n\nI cannot be on y=5 at t=15.\n\nSo impossible to be on upper freeways at t=15 or t=16.\n\nTherefore, I must be below or at safe y during t=15 and t=16.\n\nThus, the earliest I can be at y=9 is t=21, with the path as above.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at t=20 if I can be at y=8 at t=19 or something.\n\nBut from below, after t=16, I start from y=4 at t=16, need 5 moves to y=9 at t=21.\n\nIf I can be at y=5 at t=16, but I cannot, because at t=16, y=5 dangerous.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have three S actions.\n\nBut I think that's fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 1 to 4 have two cars, but in my path, I only used y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8, but y=1 not used, but fine.\n\nNow, the action sequence:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U  (since t1=11)\n\nIn the format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nt_1=11\n\nThen Turn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1}\n\netc.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt t=11: action U\n\nt=12: U\n\nt=13: S\n\nt=14: S\n\nt=15: S\n\nt=16: U\n\nt=17: U\n\nt=18: U\n\nt=19: U\n\nt=20: U\n\nNow, H=11 actions, from t=11 to t=20.\n\nAt turn t=11+11-1=21, y=9.\n\nt=21=11+10, since actions from t=11 to t=20, 10 actions, turn 21.\n\n11 + H -1 =21, H-1=10, H=11.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, for t=13,14,15: S\n\nBut let me confirm if at t=16, when I go to y=5, it is safe.\n\nt=17: y=5, we checked, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nPerhaps I can have a different path with H=10.\n\nSuppose I go to y=4 by t=13, same.\n\nThen at t=13, instead of staying, but I have to stay to avoid going up.\n\nIf I go down, worse.\n\nSo no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=0 is safe, but going down wastes turns.\n\nFor example, at t=14, I am at y=4, but instead of staying, I go down to y=3 at t=15, then at t=15 y=3, safe, but then at t=16, I need to go up or something, but I will be lower, need more steps to go up.\n\nFor instance: t=14: from y=4, D to y=3 at t=15\n\nt=15: y=3, safe\n\nThen at t=15, U to y=4 at t=16\n\nt=16: y=4, safe\n\nThen U to y=5 at t=17, etc., but now I have extra down and up, so reach y=9 later, worse.\n\nNot good.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=11 with the given sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, I used S at t=13,14,15.\n\nBut for freeways 5-8, they have three cars, but in my calculation, only the third car caused danger, but at other times safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, I think it's fine.\n\nSo the action sequence:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut H=11, actions from t=11 to t=20.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write properly.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\) with the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the strategy involves waiting at \\(y = 4\\) during the dangerous turns \\(t = 15\\) and \\(t = 16\\) for the upper freeways (\\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 8\\)) and then proceeding upward after the danger has passed. The dangerous times for each freeway group are:\n- Freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are dangerous at turns \\(t = 15\\) and \\(t = 16\\) because a car covers \\(x = 0\\) at these times.\n- Freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4\\) are dangerous at turns \\(t = 19\\) and \\(t = 20\\), but these are avoided by reaching \\(y = 9\\) before \\(t = 19\\).\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11, meaning the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t = 21\\) (since \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 11 + 11 - 1 = 21\\)).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- At turn \\(t = 11\\), move up to \\(y = 3\\) at \\(t = 12\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 12\\), move up to \\(y = 4\\) at \\(t = 13\\).\n- Stay at \\(y = 4\\) for turns \\(t = 13\\), \\(t = 14\\), and \\(t = 15\\) to avoid being on freeways \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 15\\) and \\(t = 16\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 16\\), move up to \\(y = 5\\) at \\(t = 17\\) (after the danger period for upper freeways).\n- Move up consecutively to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn \\(t = 21\\).\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions, as verified by checking the car spans at each turn:\n- At \\(t = 11\\) to \\(t = 16\\), the player is on freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\), which are safe except at \\(t = 19\\) and \\(t = 20\\) (not applicable here).\n- At \\(t = 17\\) to \\(t = 20\\), the player is on freeways \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 8\\), which are safe after \\(t = 16\\).\n\nThe actions minimize \\(H\\) because:\n- Going straight up would cause collisions at \\(t = 15\\) and \\(t = 16\\).\n- Reaching \\(y = 9\\) before \\(t = 15\\) is impossible due to the minimum 7 upward moves required from \\(y = 2\\).\n- After \\(t = 16\\), 5 upward moves are needed from \\(y = 4\\), leading to \\(y = 9\\) at \\(t = 21\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 through 8. The current turn is t₁ = 12, and I'm at y=3. Each turn, I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but I have to stay within 0 to 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway from 1 to 8, and they're moving. For each car, I'm given its head, tail, direction, and speed at turn t₁=12. All cars are moving right, based on the data. Direction is given as \"right\" for all, and since it's a span [τ, h] for right-moving, with h being the head and τ the tail.\n\nFor right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)].\n\nCollision happens at turn T if I'm on a freeway y_T and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at time T. That means the car is crossing x=0 at that turn.\n\nAlso, important: if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, I'm on y_T, and if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, I leave y_T at the end of turn T, so I'm not on y_{T+1} during turn T. Therefore, I only care about cars on my current y at time T for collision at T.\n\nThe collision condition is: at turn T, if I'm on freeway k, and for any car on freeway k, 0 is in [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] for that car.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, direction is right, so the span is increasing: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] where ΔT = T - t₁.\n\nAnd head h is greater than tail τ for right-moving, I assume, based on the span definition.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nAnd since it's [τ, h] with τ < h, I think, but let's confirm the values.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: cars (24,13,right,6) and (-42,-53,right,6)\n\n(24,13) but 24>13, so if head is 24 and tail is 13, that might imply head > tail for right-moving? But in the span, it says for right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h] with τ and h, but in the input, it's given as (head, tail, ...), so I need to interpret.\n\nLook: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for direction, it says right.\n\nThen for right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the example, first car: head=24, tail=13, so [13,24] at t₁.\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=-42, tail=-53? Head=-42, tail=-53, so since -42 > -53, [τ, h] = [-53, -42]? Tail τ is the left end, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the notation.\n\nIt says: for car, (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nThen for right-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] and since it's moving right, τ is the tail (left end), h is the head (right end), so τ ≤ h.\n\nIn the first car, (24,13,right,6), so τ=13, h=24? But it says \"head h, tail τ\", so if direction right, head is the front, which is larger x if we assume x increasing right.\n\nIn the span, [τ, h] with τ ≤ h for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, ( -42, -53, right,6), head=-42, tail=-53, since -42 > -53, so τ=-53, h=-42, so [τ, h] = [-53, -42].\n\nAt t₁=12, ΔT=0.\n\nNow, for collision: at turn T, on freeway k, if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nThat is, for a car, 0 ∈ [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] with ΔT = T - t₁.\n\nSince the cars are moving, I need to see when each car crosses x=0.\n\nBut for each freeway, there might be multiple cars, so I need to avoid being on that freeway when any car is at x=0.\n\nThe key is to find, for each freeway and each turn, whether there is a car present at x=0.\n\nBut since the cars move continuously in position but discretely in time, I think we consider the position at integer turns.\n\nThe span is at integer T, so we evaluate at turn T.\n\nAlso, note that the freeways y=1 to 8 are the ones with cars; y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since no cars there. y=0 and y=9 are not freeways with cars, I think. The freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,3), which is on freeway y=3? No, the position is (0,y), and freeways are at y=1 to 8, so when y=0 or y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible. But we need to reach (0,9), which is y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 to y=9.\n\nSince I can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, the minimum number of turns to go from 3 to 9 is 6 turns, all U actions, but I have to avoid the freeways when cars are crossing.\n\nIf I go straight up, I might hit a car if at that turn, on that y, a car is at x=0.\n\nSo I need to check for each freeway y=1 to 8, and for each turn, whether there is a car at x=0.\n\nBut I need to consider the sequence of actions.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars\n\nCar A: τ=13, h=24, s=6, right\n\nCar B: τ=-53, h=-42, s=6, right? Head and tail: first car (24,13,right,6) so τ=13, h=24\n\nSecond car (-42,-53,right,6) so τ=-53, h=-42\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2,3,4: same as freeway 1, two cars: (24,13,right,6) and (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8: three cars each: (24,13,right,6), (60,49,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nFor freeway 5: cars (24,13,right,6), (60,49,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\nFirst, for each car, I need to find when it is at x=0, that is, when 0 is in [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSince s>0, and the interval is moving right.\n\n0 ∈ [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] iff τ + sΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + sΔT\n\nWhich is equivalent to -h/s ≤ ΔT ≤ -τ/s? Let's solve.\n\nτ + sΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + sΔT\n\nSo sΔT ≤ -τ and -sΔT ≤ h? Better:\n\nFrom τ + sΔT ≤ 0: sΔT ≤ -τ, so ΔT ≤ -τ/s\n\nFrom 0 ≤ h + sΔT: -sΔT ≤ h, so ΔT ≥ -h/s\n\nTherefore, ΔT must satisfy: -h/s ≤ ΔT ≤ -τ/s\n\nSince τ ≤ h, -τ/s ≥ -h/s, so the interval is from ceil(-h/s) to floor(-τ/s) or something, but since ΔT integer, we need to find integer ΔT where this holds.\n\nActually, since positions and speeds are integers, we can find exactly.\n\nΔT = T - t₁, t₁=12.\n\nFirst, for a given car, the time when it covers x=0.\n\nThe car covers x=0 at time T if min(τ + sΔT, h + sΔT) ≤ 0 ≤ max(τ + sΔT, h + sΔT)\n\nBut since right-moving, τ + sΔT ≤ h + sΔT, so it's when τ + sΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + sΔT.\n\nThe time interval when the car is over x=0.\n\nThe start time when front reaches 0: h + sΔT = 0, so ΔT = -h/s\n\nEnd time when tail leaves 0: τ + sΔT = 0, so ΔT = -τ/s\n\nSince the car moves right, when h + sΔT = 0, the head is at 0, so from that point until τ + sΔT = 0, the tail is at 0.\n\nAt time T, position at T.\n\nAt ΔT, the left end is τ + sΔT, right end is h + sΔT.\n\nWhen τ + sΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + sΔT, then 0 is between left and right, so covered.\n\nThe car first covers x=0 when h + sΔT = 0, but since it's discrete, we need inequality.\n\nFor example, if at some ΔT, τ + sΔT = -1, h + sΔT = 2, then at x=0,1,2 are covered, so 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, if τ + sΔT = 0, h + sΔT = 3, then 0 to 3 covered.\n\nIf τ + sΔT = -2, h + sΔT = -1, then -2 to -1, 0 not covered.\n\nSo the condition is τ + sΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + sΔT.\n\nThen ΔT such that -h/s ≤ ΔT ≤ -τ/s? From above:\n\nΔT ≥ ceil( -h/s )? Let's derive.\n\nFrom τ + sΔT ≤ 0: ΔT ≤ floor( -τ/s )? Better to use inequalities with integers.\n\nSince all numbers integer, we can compute the range.\n\nLet me define for a car, the set of ΔT where it is at x=0.\n\nΔT must satisfy: τ + sΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + sΔT\n\nSo:\n\nFrom 0 ≤ h + sΔT: sΔT ≥ -h, so ΔT ≥ ceil(-h/s)\n\nFrom τ + sΔT ≤ 0: sΔT ≤ -τ, so ΔT ≤ floor(-τ/s)\n\nThen ΔT from ceil(-h/s) to floor(-τ/s) inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, if the car is left-moving, but here all are right-moving.\n\nIn this case, all cars right-moving.\n\nSo for each car, at freeway k, it is dangerous at time T if ΔT in [ceil(-h/s), floor(-τ/s)]\n\nThen for a freeway, it is dangerous at time T if any car on that freeway has ΔT in that interval for that car.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nThen for player, at turn T, if on freeway y, and y between 1 and 8, and freeway y is dangerous at T, collision; else safe.\n\nIf on y=0 or y=9, no collision.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 at t=12 to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nMinimum turns: 6 if I go up every turn, but I need to avoid dangerous times on each y.\n\nSince I start at y=3 at t=12, and I need to reach y=9.\n\nt is the turn index.\n\nLet me set t₁=12, so current time.\n\nPlayer position at time t: y_t\n\nAt t=12, y=3.\n\nI need to find actions for t=12,13,14,... until I reach y=9.\n\nAt each turn, I choose action, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn based on y_t and the cars at that time.\n\nFor turn T, y_T is the position, and we check if on freeway 1-8 and if car present at x=0.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the dangerous times.\n\nFirst, for freeways 1 to 4: same cars, so same dangerous times.\n\nCars: car1: τ=13, h=24, s=6\n\ncar2: τ=-53, h=-42, s=6\n\nt₁=12\n\nFor car1: ΔT from ceil(-h/s) to floor(-τ/s) = ceil(-24/6) to floor(-13/6)\n\n-24/6 = -4, ceil(-4) = -4\n\n-13/6 ≈ -2.166, floor(-2.166) = -3? Floor of -2.166 is -3? No.\n\nFloor is greatest integer less than or equal.\n\n-13/6 = -2 - 1/6 ≈ -2.166, so floor is -3? No, -3 < -2.166 < -2, so floor is -3? -2.166, integers less: -3, -4,... but greatest less than or equal is -3? -3 < -2.166, and -2 > -2.166, so -2 is greater, but -2 > -2.166, so floor is -3? Let's think.\n\nFor example, floor(2.3) = 2, floor(-2.3) = -3? No, floor(-2.3) = -3? -3 < -2.3 < -2, floor is -3, since -3 is less than -2.3 and integer.\n\nBut ceil(-2.3) = -2.\n\nSimilarly, ceil(-2.166) = -2, since -2 > -2.166\n\nfloor(-2.166) = -3? No, -2.166, the integers around: -3 is less, -2 is greater.\n\nFloor is the greatest integer less than or equal to x.\n\nFor x = -2.166, integers less than or equal: -3, -4, ..., and -2 is greater than -2.166, so not less than or equal. So floor is -3.\n\nBut let's confirm with numbers.\n\nSuppose ΔT = -3, then τ + sΔT = 13 + 6*(-3) = 13 - 18 = -5\n\nh + sΔT = 24 - 18 = 6\n\nSo [ -5, 6], 0 is in it? -5 ≤ 0 ≤ 6, yes.\n\nΔT = -2, τ + sΔT = 13 + 6*(-2) = 13 - 12 =1\n\nh + sΔT = 24 -12=12\n\n[1,12], 0 not in, since min=1>0\n\nΔT = -4, τ + sΔT =13 +6*(-4)=13-24=-11\n\nh + sΔT=24-24=0\n\n[ -11, 0], 0 is in, since 0≤0.\n\nAt ΔT=-4, h + sΔT=0, so 0 is included.\n\nAt ΔT=-3, as above, -5 to 6, includes 0.\n\nAt ΔT=-2, 1 to 12, min=1>0, not include 0.\n\nNow, floor(-τ/s) = floor(-13/6) = floor(-2.166) = -3? -13/6 = -2 -1/6, so floor is -3? But at ΔT=-3, it is included, at ΔT=-2 not.\n\nceil(-h/s) = ceil(-24/6) = ceil(-4) = -4\n\nfloor(-τ/s) = floor(-13/6) = floor(-2.166) = -3\n\nThen ΔT from -4 to -3 inclusive.\n\nΔT = -4 and -3.\n\nAt ΔT=-4: as above, span [-11,0], includes 0\n\nΔT=-3: [-5,6], includes 0\n\nΔT=-2: [1,12], not include\n\nSo range ΔT = -4 to -3.\n\nNow for car2: τ=-53, h=-42, s=6\n\nceil(-h/s) = ceil(-(-42)/6) = ceil(42/6) = ceil(7) =7\n\n- h = -(-42) =42? Let's see.\n\nΔT ≥ ceil(-h/s) = ceil( - (-42) / 6 ) no\n\n- h/s = - (-42)/6 = 42/6 =7, ceil(7)=7\n\nΔT ≤ floor(-τ/s) = floor( - (-53)/6 ) = floor(53/6) = floor(8.833) =8\n\n-τ/s = -(-53)/6 =53/6=8.833, floor=8\n\nThen ΔT from ceil(-h/s)=7 to floor(-τ/s)=8\n\nSo ΔT=7,8\n\nCheck: ΔT=7, τ + sΔT = -53 +6*7 = -53+42= -11\n\nh + sΔT = -42 +42=0, so [-11,0], includes 0\n\nΔT=8, τ + sΔT = -53 +48= -5\n\nh + sΔT = -42 +48=6, [-5,6], includes 0\n\nΔT=9, τ + sΔT = -53+54=1, h + sΔT=-42+54=12, [1,12], not include 0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, dangerous at ΔT = -4,-3 from car1, and ΔT=7,8 from car2.\n\nΔT relative to t₁=12, so T = t₁ + ΔT.\n\nFor freeway 1, dangerous at T=12 + (-4) =8, and T=12-3=9, from car1\n\nAnd T=12+7=19, T=12+8=20 from car2.\n\nSimilarly for freeways 2,3,4 same.\n\nNow freeway 5,6,7,8 have three cars.\n\nFirst car: same as above, (24,13,right,6) so τ=13,h=24,s=6, dangerous at ΔT=-4,-3, so T=8,9\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,6) τ=49,h=60,s=6\n\nΔT ≥ ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-60/6) = ceil(-10) = -10\n\nΔT ≤ floor(-τ/s) = floor(-49/6) = floor(-8.166) = -9? -49/6 = -8 -1/6 ≈ -8.166, floor is -9? Since -9 < -8.166\n\nCheck: ΔT = -10, τ + sΔT =49 +6*(-10)=49-60= -11\n\nh + sΔT=60-60=0, [-11,0], include 0\n\nΔT=-9, τ + sΔT=49-54= -5, h + sΔT=60-54=6, [-5,6], include 0\n\nΔT=-8, τ + sΔT=49-48=1, h + sΔT=60-48=12, [1,12], not include\n\nSo ΔT from ceil(-10)= -10 to floor(-49/6)=floor(-8.166)= -9? -8.166, floor is -9? Integers: -9 < -8.166 < -8, so floor is -9.\n\nAt ΔT=-9, as above, include.\n\nΔT=-8: not include.\n\nSo ΔT=-10,-9\n\nT=12-10=2, 12-9=3\n\nt₁=12, ΔT=-10, T=2; ΔT=-9, T=3\n\nThird car for freeway 5: (-18,-29,right,6) head=-18, tail=-29? (head h, tail τ) = (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nSo τ=-29, h=-18, s=6\n\nThen ΔT ≥ ceil(-h/s) = ceil( - (-18)/6 ) = ceil(18/6) = ceil(3) =3\n\nΔT ≤ floor(-τ/s) = floor( - (-29)/6 ) = floor(29/6) = floor(4.833) =4\n\nSo ΔT from 3 to 4\n\nT=12+3=15, 12+4=16\n\nNow, for freeway 5, cars:\n\nCar1: dangerous at T=8,9\n\nCar2: dangerous at T=2,3\n\nCar3: dangerous at T=15,16\n\nSo freeway 5 dangerous when any car dangerous, so at T=2,3,8,9,15,16\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6,7,8 same as 5.\n\nNow freeways 1-4 dangerous at T=8,9,19,20\n\nFreeways 5-8 dangerous at T=2,3,8,9,15,16\n\nNow, player at t=12, y=3.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=3 is freeway 3, which is one of 1-4, so dangerous at T=8,9,19,20.\n\nBut T=12, current time, let's see if it is dangerous.\n\nAt T=12, for freeway 3, ΔT=0.\n\nFor car1: at ΔT=0, τ=13, h=24, [13,24], min=13>0, not include 0.\n\nCar2: τ=-53, h=-42, [-53,-42], max=-42<0, not include 0.\n\nSo safe at T=12 on y=3.\n\nNow, I need to move to y=9.\n\nThe direct path: U,U,U,U,U,U to go from 3 to 9 in 6 turns.\n\nBut I need to avoid dangerous times on each y.\n\nLet me list the dangerous times for each y.\n\ny=1,2,3,4: dangerous at T=8,9,19,20\n\ny=5,6,7,8: dangerous at T=2,3,8,9,15,16\n\nNow, at t=12, y=3, safe.\n\nI want to go up to y=4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=9 is safe always.\n\nNow, the dangerous times are in the past except for future.\n\nT=12 now, so T=8,9 are past, T=2,3 past, only future dangerous: T=15,16 for y=5-8, and T=19,20 for y=1-4.\n\nSince I'm going up, I will be on y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=3 at t=12, then if I go up, at t=13, y=4, etc.\n\nLet's see the times.\n\nI need to be on each freeway at times when it is safe.\n\nFor y=4: freeway 4, which is y=1-4 group, dangerous at T=19,20. But T=19,20 are far future, and since I'm moving up, I might not be on y=4 at that time if I go fast.\n\nSimilarly, y=5: dangerous at T=15,16, and also T=2,3,8,9 past.\n\nT=15,16 are future.\n\nNow, let's plan the sequence.\n\nStart at t=12, y=3, safe.\n\nI can choose action at t=12 to go to y=4, or stay, or down, but down to y=2 might be dangerous if at bad time, but let's see.\n\nSince I need to go up, probably best to go up.\n\nAssume I go up as much as possible.\n\nIf I go all U from t=12 to t=17: let's see positions.\n\nAt t=12, y=3\n\nAfter action at t=12, y_{13} = y_12 + Δy, depending on a_{12}\n\nLet's define the turn.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t, then I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t, I am on freeway y_t, and collision check based on cars at time t.\n\nThen for next turn.\n\nSo for turn t, position y_t, and time t.\n\nFrom t=12 to when I reach y=9.\n\ny=9 at some turn, when I arrive.\n\nI need to reach (0,9), so when y_t =9 for some t.\n\nThen H is the number of turns from t=12 to that t, but the sequence from t=12 to t=12+H-1, and y_{12+H-1} =9.\n\nFor example, if at t=12, I do U, then y=4 at t=13, and so on, to y=9 at t=18? Start y=3 at t=12.\n\nAfter 0 actions, y=3 at t=12.\n\nAfter first action, say a_{12}, y_{13} = y_{12} + Δy\n\nThen at t=13, y=y_{13}, and so on.\n\nTo have y_t =9, for some t.\n\nThe minimal t when I can be at y=9.\n\nFrom y=3, to y=9, difference 6, so minimum 6 actions U, so at t=12+6=18, y=9 if I go up each turn.\n\nAt t=18, y=9, which is safe.\n\nBut I need to be safe during the path.\n\nNow, let's list the positions and times.\n\nSet t from 12 onwards.\n\nAt t=12: y=3, safe as above.\n\nNow, action a_{12}: if U, then y_{13} =4\n\nIf S, y_{13}=3\n\nIf D, y_{13}=2\n\nBut I need to go up, so probably U or S, but S delays.\n\nFirst, try all U.\n\na_{12} = U: y_{13} =4\n\nAt t=13, y=4, which is freeway 4, dangerous at T=19,20, not 13, so safe? T=13, for freeway 4.\n\nDangerous times T=8,9,19,20, so at T=13, safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_{13} = U: y_{14} =5\n\nt=14, y=5, freeway 5, dangerous at T=2,3,8,9,15,16. T=14 not in, so safe.\n\na_{14} = U: y_{15} =6\n\nt=15, y=6, freeway 6, dangerous at T=15,16? For y=5-8, dangerous at T=15,16.\n\nT=15, dangerous!\n\nIf at t=15, y=6, which is freeway 6, and T=15, which is dangerous for y=5-8.\n\nSo collision if I am on y=6 at t=15.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=5 at t=14, safe, but at t=15, if I go to y=6, collision.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=12: y=3, safe\n\na_{12}=U: y_{13}=4\n\nt=13: y=4, safe (since dangerous only 19,20)\n\na_{13}=U: y_{14}=5\n\nt=14: y=5, safe (T=14 not dangerous)\n\na_{14}=U: y_{15}=6\n\nt=15: y=6, but freeway 6 dangerous at t=15, so collision.\n\nCannot do U at t=14.\n\nIf I do S at t=14, then y_{15} = y_{14} =5? Action at t=14.\n\nAt t=14, y=5, I choose a_{14}.\n\nIf a_{14}=S, then y_{15} =5 (same)\n\nThen at t=15, y=5, which is freeway 5, dangerous at t=15, so collision.\n\nIf a_{14}=D, then y_{15}=4, but y=4 at t=15, freeway 4, dangerous only at 19,20, so safe at t=15, but I go down, which is away from goal.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo on t=15, if I am on any of y=5,6,7,8, it is dangerous.\n\ny=5-8 all dangerous at t=15 and t=16.\n\nAt t=15 and t=16, freeways 5,6,7,8 are dangerous.\n\nSo I should not be on y=5,6,7,8 at t=15 or t=16.\n\nSimilarly, at other times, they might be safe, but specifically at t=15 and 16, must avoid.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nAt t=14, I am at y=5 (if I went up twice).\n\nI need to not be on y=5-8 at t=15 and t=16.\n\nSo I can either stay below or go above, but above is y=6,7,8 which are part of 5-8.\n\ny=5-8 are the dangerous ones.\n\ny=4 is safe at t=15, since dangerous only at 19,20.\n\ny=3 safe, etc.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nSo at t=15 and t=16, I need to be on y<=4 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is far.\n\nCurrently at t=14, y=5.\n\nIf I go down to y=4 at t=15.\n\na_{14}=D: then y_{15} = y_{14} -1 =5-1=4\n\nThen at t=15, y=4, which is freeway 4, dangerous only at 19,20, so safe at t=15.\n\nThen at t=15, I am at y=4.\n\nNow, t=16, I need to avoid y=5-8, so I should not go up immediately.\n\nIf I stay at y=4, a_{15}=S, then y_{16}=4\n\nt=16, y=4, safe, since not dangerous.\n\nThen after t=16, the danger is over for now, since next dangerous for y=5-8 is T=15,16, past.\n\nT=15,16 done.\n\nThen I can go up.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, from t=15, y=4.\n\na_{15}, I can choose.\n\nIf I do nothing, but I need to go up.\n\nSince danger at t=15,16, I can wait at y=4.\n\nt=15: y=4\n\na_{15}=S: y_{16}=4\n\nt=16: y=4, safe\n\nThen a_{16}=U: y_{17}=5\n\nt=17: y=5, freeway 5, dangerous times past and future T=15,16 past, next T=19,20? For y=5-8, dangerous at T=2,3,8,9,15,16 all past, and no more? Earlier: for y=5-8, dangerous at T=2,3,8,9,15,16.\n\nT=2,3,8,9,15,16 all <=16, and since t=17>16, no future dangerous times except for y=1-4 at T=19,20, but y=5-8 should be safe after t=16.\n\nIs that right?\n\nFor y=5-8, cars: dangerous at T=2,3 from car2, T=8,9 from car1, T=15,16 from car3.\n\nAfter T=16, no more, since car3 only up to T=16.\n\nSimilarly, car1 at T=8,9, car2 at T=2,3, all past.\n\nSo for t>16, freeways 5-8 are always safe? Not necessarily, but in this case, no cars at x=0 after T=16.\n\nSimilarly, for y=1-4, dangerous at T=8,9,19,20.\n\nT=19,20 future.\n\nBut for now, after t=16, y=5-8 safe.\n\nBack to sequence.\n\nAt t=14: y=5, I need to go down to avoid danger.\n\nIn the all-up path, at t=14, y=5.\n\nThen a_{14}=D: y_{15}=4\n\nt=15: y=4, safe\n\na_{15}=S: y_{16}=4 (I can go up later)\n\nt=16: y=4, safe\n\nNow a_{16}=U: y_{17}=5\n\nt=17: y=5, now safe, since t=17>16\n\na_{17}=U: y_{18}=6\n\nt=18: y=6, safe\n\na_{18}=U: y_{19}=7\n\nt=19: y=7, freeway 7, dangerous at T=19? For y=5-8, dangerous at T=19? No, for y=5-8, dangerous only at T=2,3,8,9,15,16, not 19.\n\nT=19 is for y=1-4 dangerous.\n\ny=7 is not y=1-4, so at t=19, y=7, should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_{19}=U: y_{20}=8\n\nt=20: y=8, freeway 8, dangerous at T=20? For y=5-8, not dangerous at T=20, only up to 16.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen a_{20}=U: y_{21}=9\n\nt=21: y=9, reached.\n\nBut this takes many turns: from t=12 to t=21, that's 10 turns? Let's count.\n\nStart t=12, y=3\n\nAfter actions:\n\nt=12: a12, y13\n\n...\n\nAt t=12, before action, y=3.\n\nAfter a12, y13 set.\n\nAfter a13, y14 set, etc.\n\nWhen y_t=9, that is the position at time t.\n\nFor example, if I reach y=9 at t=21.\n\nThen I used actions from t=12 to t=20, that's 9 actions? Turns from t=12 to t=20 inclusive? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions: for turns t=12,13,14,..., up to when y_{t} =9.\n\nAt turn t, I perform action a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nThe position y_t is at the beginning of turn t, I think.\n\nThe game says: at turn T, player position (0, y_T), then I choose action, then update to next position.\n\nCollision at turn T based on y_T and cars at T.\n\nSo y_T is position during turn T.\n\nI need y_T =9 for some T.\n\nIn the sequence, I start at t=12 with y=3.\n\nAfter H turns, I should have y_{12 + H} =9? Let's see the indices.\n\nSuppose at turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nThen at turn t+1, position y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nI need to find H such that y_{12 + H} =9.\n\nFor example, if I go up every turn, y_{13}=4, y_{14}=5, ..., y_{18}=9, so at t=18, y=9.\n\nH=6 actions from t=12 to t=17: actions at t=12,13,14,15,16,17 to reach y_{18}=9.\n\nt=12: y=3, a12=U, y13=4\n\nt=13: y=4, a13=U, y14=5\n\nt=14: y=5, a14=U, y15=6\n\nBut at t=15, y=6, collision as before.\n\nIn my earlier safer sequence, I had:\n\nt=12: y=3, a12=U, y13=4\n\nt=13: y=4, a13=U, y14=5\n\nt=14: y=5, a14=D? Instead of U, I go down to avoid.\n\na14=D, then y15=4\n\nt=15: y=4, safe\n\nThen a15=S, y16=4? Or I can go up later.\n\na15=S, then y16=4\n\nt=16: y=4, safe\n\nThen a16=U, y17=5\n\nt=17: y=5, safe\n\na17=U, y18=6\n\nt=18: y=6, safe\n\na18=U, y19=7\n\nt=19: y=7, safe\n\na19=U, y20=8\n\nt=20: y=8, safe\n\na20=U, y21=9\n\nt=21: y=9, reached.\n\nNow, actions from t=12 to t=20, that's 9 actions: a12 to a20.\n\nBut I reached at t=21.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think the minimal H.\n\nBut I can do better.\n\nSince the danger is only at t=15 and t=16 for y=5-8, I can be on y=4 or below at that time.\n\nBut I can go up faster before or after.\n\nAt t=12, y=3, I can go up to y=4 at t=13, then to y=5 at t=14.\n\nThen at t=14, instead of going down, I can stay at y=5? But at t=14, y=5 is safe, but if I stay at t=14, a14=S, then y15=5, but at t=15, y=5, dangerous, collision.\n\nSo I cannot stay; I must leave y=5-8 before t=15.\n\nSo at t=14, I need to go down to y=4.\n\nThen I am at y=4 for t=15 and t=16.\n\nThen at t=17, I can go up to y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut from y=4 to y=9, I need 5 actions: U,U,U,U,U to go to y=9 at t=22? Let's see.\n\nAfter t=16, y=4.\n\nt=16: y=4\n\na16=U, y17=5\n\nt=17: y=5\n\na17=U, y18=6\n\nt=18: y=6\n\na18=U, y19=7\n\nt=19: y=7\n\na19=U, y20=8\n\nt=20: y=8\n\na20=U, y21=9\n\nt=21: y=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut I started from t=12 y=3 to t=21 y=9, with actions at t=12 to 20.\n\nBut at t=12, I did U to go to y=4 at t=13.\n\nI could do multiple U earlier, but no, because before t=15, at t=14 I have to go down.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=9 directly but skip the dangerous times.\n\nBut dangerous times are only for specific y.\n\nI can go to y=9 before t=15 or after t=16, but from y=3 to y=9, minimum 6 turns, so at t=18 if all U.\n\nBut at t=15 and t=16, if I am on y=5-8, collision, so I need to be on y<=4 or y=9 at t=15 and t=16.\n\ny=9 at t=15: from y=3 at t=12, to y=9 at t=15, that would require y increasing by 6 in 3 turns, impossible since max +1 per turn. So cannot be at y=9 before t=18.\n\nSimilarly, at t=16, to be at y=9, need from t=12 to t=16, 4 turns, increase by 6? From t=12 to t=16 is 4 steps: y13,y14,y15,y16.\n\ny12=3, after 4 actions, y16 could be at most 3+4=7, less than 9. So impossible to be at y=9 at t=16 or earlier.\n\nTherefore, at t=15 and t=16, I must be on y<=4, since y=9 impossible.\n\ny<=4 includes y=0,1,2,3,4.\n\ny=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nBut y=1,2,3,4 have dangerous times, but at t=15,16, for y=1-4, dangerous only at T=19,20, not 15 or 16, so all safe at t=15,16.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 safe.\n\nSo at t=15 and t=16, I need to be on y<=4.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI start at t=12, y=3.\n\nI can go up to y=4 or y=5 quickly.\n\nBut at t=14, I must be at y<=4, because at t=15, I need to be <=4.\n\nt=15 position y15 <=4.\n\nSimilarly t=16 y16 <=4.\n\nNow, from t=12 to t=14: I have two actions, a12 and a13.\n\ny12=3\n\nAfter a12, y13 =3,4, or2\n\nAfter a13, y14 = y13 + Δy\n\nI need y15 <=4 and y16 <=4.\n\nBut y15 depends on a14, etc.\n\nTo minimize time, I should go up as much as possible until I need to avoid.\n\nFor example:\n\na12=U: y13=4\n\na13=U: y14=5\n\nNow at t=14, y=5\n\nBut I need y15 <=4, so I must choose a14 such that y15 <=4.\n\nSince y14=5, if a14=D, y15=4 <=4\n\nIf a14=S, y15=5>4, not <=4, and at t=15 dangerous if on y=5-8.\n\nIf a14=U, y15=6>4, worse.\n\nSo only choice a14=D, y15=4\n\nThen y15=4 <=4, safe at t=15.\n\nNow for t=16, I need y16 <=4.\n\ny15=4, so if a15=S, y16=4 <=4\n\nIf a15=D, y16=3<=4\n\nIf a15=U, y16=5>4, not allowed, since at t=16, if y=5, dangerous.\n\nSo a15 must be S or D, so that y16 <=4.\n\nTo save time, I should do a15=S, so y16=4, then later go up.\n\na15=D would go down, worse.\n\nSo a15=S, y16=4\n\nThen at t=16, y=4, safe.\n\nNow after, I can go up.\n\na16=U: y17=5\n\nt=17: y=5, safe as t=17>16\n\na17=U: y18=6\n\nt=18: y=6, safe\n\na18=U: y19=7\n\nt=19: y=7, safe\n\na19=U: y20=8\n\nt=20: y=8, safe\n\na20=U: y21=9\n\nt=21: y=9\n\nReached at t=21 with 9 actions.\n\nBut from y=4 to y=9, it takes 5 actions: to y17=5, y18=6, y19=7, y20=8, y21=9.\n\nBut I was at y=4 at t=16, so to y=9 at t=21.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be at higher y before t=15.\n\nBut at t=14, I am at y=5, and I have to go down to y=4 at t=15.\n\nThen stuck at y=4 for t=16.\n\nAfter t=16, I go up, but from y=4 to y=9, min 5 turns, so t=21.\n\nBut t=16 y=4, after 5 ups: t=17 y=5, t=18 y=6, t=19 y=7, t=20 y=8, t=21 y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 faster by not going down, but I have to avoid the danger.\n\nAnother idea: instead of going up to y=5 at t=14, I could stay lower.\n\nFor example, at t=12, I do S or D, but that delays.\n\nWorse.\n\nGo up but slower.\n\nBut not better.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=6 or higher before t=15, but y=6 at t=15 is dangerous.\n\nFor example, if I go U,U,U from t=12 to t=15 y=6, but at t=15 collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think 9 turns is necessary with this path.\n\nBut let's confirm the dangerous times.\n\nAt t=15 and t=16, y=5-8 dangerous.\n\nNo other dangerous times nearby.\n\ny=1-4 dangerous at t=19,20, but I can avoid being on them at that time.\n\nIn the above path, at t=19, I am on y=7, not on y=1-4, so safe.\n\nSimilarly t=20 y=8 safe.\n\nNow, to reach faster, perhaps I can be at y=9 by t=18, but to be at y=9 at t=18, I need to have y18=9.\n\ny12=3, so in 6 steps, y18=9 with all U.\n\nBut in those steps, at t=15, I would be at y=6 if all U from t=12.\n\nt=12: y=3\n\na12=U, y13=4\n\na13=U, y14=5\n\na14=U, y15=6\n\nt=15: y=6, collision\n\nIf I do not go to y=6 at t=15.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at t=18, I need to be at y=6 at t=15 or something.\n\ny12=3\n\ny13: 4\n\ny14:5\n\ny15:6\n\ny16:7\n\ny17:8\n\ny18:9\n\nSo at t=15, y=6, which is during danger, collision.\n\nIf I can be at y=5 at t=15, but y=5 also dangerous.\n\ny<=4 at t=15.\n\nBut if y15<=4, then y16 <=5, y17<=6, y18<=7 <9, cannot reach y=9 at t=18.\n\nIf y15=4, then y16 max 5, y17 max 6, y18 max 7, not 9.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 before t=18? y18=9 possible only if I go up every turn from t=12 to t=17.\n\ny12=3, y13=4, y14=5, y15=6, y16=7, y17=8, y18=9.\n\nBut at t=15, y=6 dangerous; t=16, y=7 dangerous.\n\nSo collision at both t=15 and t=16.\n\nCannot avoid if I go directly.\n\nTherefore, I must take more turns to avoid those times.\n\nSo minimal H might be 9, reaching at t=21.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach by t=20 or something.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=9 at t=20.\n\nThen y20=9.\n\ny12=3, so 8 steps? From t=12 to t=20, positions y13 to y20.\n\ny12=3\n\nAfter 8 actions, y20 could be from 3-8 to 3+8=11, but bounded, so y20=9 possible with some downs or stays.\n\nBut I need to minimize turns, so I want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut to be at y=20 at t=20, I need the path.\n\nSince I have to avoid t=15 and t=16 on y=5-8, I can be on y=9 at those times, but impossible as before.\n\ny=9 at t=15 impossible.\n\nSo I must be on y<=4 at t=15 and t=16.\n\nThen the earliest to reach y=9 is after that.\n\nFor example, at t=16, y<=4, say y=4.\n\nThen from there, to y=9, need 5 ups, so at t=21 y=9.\n\nIf at t=16, I am at y=3 or 2, it takes more.\n\nSo y=4 at t=16 is best.\n\nThen t=17 y=5, t=18 y=6, t=19 y=7, t=20 y=8, t=21 y=9.\n\nNow, how to be at y=4 at t=16.\n\nFrom start, at t=12 y=3.\n\nI need to go to y=4 at some point.\n\nFor example, I can go up to y=4 at t=13, then to y=5 at t=14, then down to y=4 at t=15, then stay or something to y=4 at t=16.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=12: y=3, a12=U, y13=4\n\nt=13: y=4, a13=U, y14=5\n\nt=14: y=5, a14=D, y15=4\n\nt=15: y=4, a15=S, y16=4  (to stay at 4)\n\nt=16: y=4\n\nThen a16=U, y17=5\n\netc. to t=21 y=9.\n\nI could go up faster after t=16, but no, min 5 turns.\n\nPerhaps I can reach a higher position before t=14.\n\nFor example, at t=12, I go U to y=4 at t=13.\n\nThen at t=13, if I go U to y=5 at t=14.\n\nBut at t=14, I have to go down, so I can't go higher.\n\nIf at t=12, I stay or something, but worse.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=2 or something, but that might be dangerous or slower.\n\nFor example, y=2 at t=15: freeway 2, dangerous at T=19,20, not 15, safe, but going down is away.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nSo I think 9 actions is minimal.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nActions from t=12 to t=20 to reach y=9 at t=21.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t_12: U  (to go to y=4 at t=13)\n\nTurn t_13: U  (to y=5 at t=14)\n\nTurn t_14: D  (to y=4 at t=15)  // to avoid danger at t=15\n\nTurn t_15: S  (to y=4 at t=16)  // to avoid danger at t=16, stay at y=4\n\nTurn t_16: U  (to y=5 at t=17)\n\nTurn t_17: U  (to y=6 at t=18)\n\nTurn t_18: U  (to y=7 at t=19)\n\nTurn t_19: U  (to y=8 at t=20)\n\nTurn t_20: U  (to y=9 at t=21)\n\nNow, at t=21, y=9, reached.\n\nH=9 turns, actions from t=12 to t=20.\n\nBut the player reaches at turn t=21.\n\nIn the answer, I need to list actions from t=12 onwards until the last action before reaching.\n\nIn the sequence, after a20, y21=9.\n\nSo actions a12 to a20.\n\nNow, but at t=19 and t=20, I am on y=7 and y=8, which are freeways 7 and 8, but at t=19 and t=20, for y=5-8, no danger, as dangerous times past.\n\nSimilarly, for y=1-4, dangerous at t=19,20, but I am not on them.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut can I save one turn?\n\nSuppose at t=15, after going down to y=4, instead of staying, I could go up, but at t=16, I need to be <=4, so if I go up at t=15, y16=5, which at t=16 dangerous.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt t=14, instead of going down from y=5, I could go to y=4 earlier.\n\nBut I am at y=5 at t=14, must go down to be <=4 at t=15.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=4 at t=14.\n\nThen at t=14, y=4, safe.\n\nThen I can choose a14.\n\nIf I go U, y15=5, but at t=15 dangerous.\n\nIf I stay, y15=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=15, y=4, I can stay or go down, but better stay.\n\nThen a15=S, y16=4.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut to be at y=4 at t=14, I need to not go to y=5.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=12: y=3, a12=U, y13=4\n\nt=13: y=4, instead of U, I do S or D.\n\nIf a13=S, y14=4\n\nThen at t=14, y=4\n\nThen a14=S, y15=4\n\nt=15: y=4\n\na15=S, y16=4\n\nThen a16=U, y17=5, etc, but I lost time by staying, so reach later.\n\nWorse.\n\na13=D, y14=3, then worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nTherefore, the sequence I have seems minimal: 9 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=14 I go down, then at t=15 I stay.\n\nI could at t=15 go down to y=3, but then I need to come up, worse.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H=9.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nI need to output the actions.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 5-8, there is car at T=15,16, but in my path, I avoid being on those freeways at that time.\n\nNow, about the initial position: at t=12, I am at y=3, and I start with action.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for turn t_12, t_13, ..., t_20.\n\nReaching at t=21.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at t=20.\n\ny20=9.\n\nThen from y12=3 to y20=9, increase of 6 in 8 steps? y12 to y20 is 8 steps? y12=3, after actions a12 to a19, y20 set.\n\ny20 = y12 + sum_{t=12 to 19} Δy_t\n\nTo have y20=9, since y12=3, need sum Δy =6 over 8 actions.\n\nEach Δy = -1,0,1.\n\nSo possible, for example, 6 U, 2 S, or 7 U and 1 D, etc.\n\nBut I need to avoid collisions.\n\nFor instance, if I go U all, but as before, at t=15 y=6 or something.\n\ny12=3\n\ny13: if U,4\n\ny14: U,5\n\ny15: must be <=4, so cannot U or S if at 5, must D to 4 or less.\n\nSuppose y15=4\n\nThen y16: must <=4, so S or D, say S, y16=4\n\nThen y17: U,5\n\ny18: U,6\n\ny19: U,7\n\ny20: U,8 or if I do U, y20=8, not 9.\n\ny19=7, a19=U, y20=8\n\nThen to reach y=9, need another action.\n\nAt y20=8, a20=U, y21=9.\n\nBut y20=8 at t=20, which is safe, but not 9.\n\nIf I want y20=9, I need y19=8 or 9 with S.\n\nBut from above, at y16=4, y17=5, y18=6, y19=7, max y19=7 with U,U,U.\n\nThen y20=8 with U.\n\nCannot y20=9.\n\nIf at some point I go faster, but I cannot because of the danger constraint.\n\nFor example, at t=13, if I am at y=4, I could go U to y=5 at t=14, but then at t=14 I have to go down to y=4 at t=15, so y15=4.\n\nThen y16=4 if stay.\n\nThen from y16=4 to y20, 4 actions, y20 <=8.\n\nNot 9.\n\nIf after danger, I go up faster, but min steps.\n\nSuppose I go down at some point to save time, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=15 and t=16, I need to be <=4, I can be at y=0 or something, but that might take more downs.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nSo I think it's impossible to reach before t=21.\n\nThus minimal H=9.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have actions from t=12 to t=20.\n\nBut at t=14, I go down, which might be counterintuitive, but necessary to avoid.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=8 or 9 after t=16 quickly.\n\nBut from t=16 y=4 to y=9, min 5 turns.\n\nt=17 y=5, t=18 y=6, t=19 y=7, t=20 y=8, t=21 y=9.\n\nCannot skip.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, about the car on freeway 3 at start, but we are safe at t=12.\n\nIn the action sequence, I need to write for each turn.\n\nAlso, in the answer format, it should be like:\n\nTurn t_12: U\n\nTurn t_13: U\n\nTurn t_14: D\n\nTurn t_15: S\n\nTurn t_16: U\n\nTurn t_17: U\n\nTurn t_18: U\n\nTurn t_19: U\n\nTurn t_20: U\n\nAnd after a20, y21=9.\n\nH=9.\n\nBut let's list the turns: t=12 to t=20, that's 9 turns.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=14 I do D, which is down, but since I go down to y=4, and y=4 is safe at t=15 and t=16.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, but dangerous only at t=19,20, not 15,16.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid going down by staying at y=4.\n\nBut in that case, I reach later or same.\n\nFor example, if at t=13 I stay at y=4, then at t=14 I am at y=4, then I can stay at t=14 and t=15, but then at t=16 still y=4, then go up, same as before but I didn't go to y=5, so I saved the down, but I stayed longer at low y.\n\nIn terms of reaching time, same t=21.\n\nBut with one less action? No.\n\nIn this case: t=12: U to y=4 at t=13\n\nt=13: S to y=4 at t=14? a13=S, y14=4\n\nt=14: S to y=4 at t=15? a14=S, y15=4\n\nt=15: S to y=4 at t=16? a15=S, y16=4\n\nThen a16=U, y17=5\n\n...\n\nto a20=U, y21=9\n\nSame as before, but I used S at t=13,t=14,t=15 instead of U then D then S.\n\nBut in the first sequence, I had a13=U, a14=D, a15=S, which has one U and one D, net zero, but I went to y=5 and back, but position at t=16 same y=4.\n\nAnd I used three actions: U,D,S to stay at y=4 from t=13 to t=16? From t=13 y=4 to t=16 y=4, with actions.\n\nIn first sequence: at t=13 y=4, a13=U to y=5 at t=14, then a14=D to y=4 at t=15, then a15=S to y=4 at t=16. So from t=13 to t=16, y changed but back to 4.\n\nIn the stay sequence: a13=S, y14=4; a14=S, y15=4; a15=S, y16=4; no change.\n\nBut in both cases, at t=16 I am at y=4, and I start going up at t=16.\n\nThe reaching time is same, t=21.\n\nBut in the first sequence, I have an extra action at t=14 with D, but the number of actions to reach is same, since from t=12 to t=20 actions in both cases.\n\nIn first sequence: actions t=12 to t=20: 9 actions.\n\nIn stay sequence: actions t=12 (U), t=13 (S), t=14 (S), t=15 (S), t=16 (U), t=17 (U), t=18 (U), t=19 (U), t=20 (U): still 9 actions, reach at t=21.\n\nBut in stay sequence, I have three S, whereas in the first I have U then D then S, which might be worse because I moved unnecessarily, but in terms of turn count, same.\n\nBut in the first sequence, I went to y=5 and back, which might risk if there was danger, but at t=14, y=5 is safe, since T=14 not dangerous for y=5, as dangerous times 2,3,8,9,15,16, not 14.\n\nSo safe, but unnecessary move.\n\nBut for minimal turns, same.\n\nI could go up to y=5 and stay, but cannot because of t=15.\n\nSo the sequence with down is fine, or I can do the stay.\n\nBut in the stay sequence, I don't go to y=5, so I save the down, but I stay at y=4 longer.\n\nBut action count same.\n\nTo have fewer actions, but H is the number of turns, which is the same.\n\nPerhaps I can reach with fewer actions by going faster after.\n\nBut no.\n\nSo I think H=9 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, I should specify the actions.\n\nAlso, for the car, I think I covered all.\n\nOne thing: at t=19 and t=20, for y=1-4 dangerous, but I am not on them.\n\nIn my sequence, at t=19, y=7, t=20 y=8, both safe.\n\ny=7 and 8 are not y=1-4.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn t_12: U\n\nTurn t_13: U\n\nTurn t_14: D\n\nTurn t_15: S\n\nTurn t_16: U\n\nTurn t_17: U\n\nTurn t_18: U\n\nTurn t_19: U\n\nTurn t_20: U\n\nAfter that, at turn t=21, y=9.\n\nIn the action, for turn t, it affects y_{t+1}.\n\nBut the collision is at each turn based on y_t.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nAt t=12: y=3, safe\n\na12=U\n\nAt t=13: y=4, safe\n\na13=U\n\nAt t=14: y=5, safe (t=14 not dangerous)\n\na14=D\n\nAt t=15: y=4, safe\n\na15=S\n\nAt t=16: y=4, safe\n\na16=U\n\nAt t=17: y=5, safe\n\na17=U\n\nAt t=18: y=6, safe\n\na18=U\n\nAt t=19: y=7, safe\n\na19=U\n\nAt t=20: y=8, safe\n\na20=U\n\nThen at t=21: y=9, reached.\n\nAll safe.\n\nI think this is correct.\n\nSo H=9.\n\nNow for the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The cars on each freeway move right with given positions and speeds at \\(t_1 = 12\\), and their positions at future turns are computed using the update rules. Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) if the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y_T \\leq 8\\)) and \\(0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway at \\(T\\).\n\n### Dangerous Times for Freeways:\n- **Freeways 1–4**: Dangerous at turns 8, 9, 19, and 20.\n- **Freeways 5–8**: Dangerous at turns 2, 3, 8, 9, 15, and 16.\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3) at \\(t = 12\\), which is safe. The direct path upward (all \"U\" actions) would reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 18 but results in collisions at turns 15 and 16 on freeways 5–8. To avoid these collisions, the player must not be on freeways 5–8 at turns 15 and 16, requiring the player to be at \\(y \\leq 4\\) or \\(y = 9\\) at these turns. Since \\(y = 9\\) is impossible by turn 16 (due to movement constraints), the player must be at \\(y \\leq 4\\) at turns 15 and 16. The minimal sequence involves:\n- Moving up to \\(y = 5\\) by turn 14 (safe, as turn 14 is not dangerous for freeway 5).\n- Moving down to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 15 to avoid danger on freeways 5–8.\n- Staying at \\(y = 4\\) at turn 16 to continue avoiding danger.\n- Moving upward from turn 17 onward, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 21.\n\nThis sequence uses 9 turns (actions from \\(t = 12\\) to \\(t = 20\\)) and ensures no collisions:\n- At turn 14 (\\(y = 5\\)), safe as turn 14 is not dangerous for freeway 5.\n- At turns 15 and 16 (\\(y = 4\\)), safe as freeway 4 is not dangerous at these turns.\n- At turns 17–20 (\\(y = 5\\) to \\(8\\)), safe as freeways 5–8 are not dangerous after turn 16.\n\nNo shorter sequence is possible, as reaching \\(y = 9\\) before turn 21 would require being on a freeway 5–8 during turns 15 or 16, causing a collision.\n\n### Action Sequence (Minimal \\(H = 9\\)):\nThe actions are chosen to minimize turns while avoiding collisions:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_12: U \\\\\nTurn t_13: U \\\\\nTurn t_14: D \\\\\nTurn t_15: S \\\\\nTurn t_16: U \\\\\nTurn t_17: U \\\\\nTurn t_18: U \\\\\nTurn t_19: U \\\\\nTurn t_20: U\n}\n\n**Explanation of the Path:**\n- **Turn 12 (action U)**: Move from \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 13.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 13, and I'm at y=4.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movement. All cars are moving right with speed 6. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)], where s=6 and t_1=13.\n\nFor each car, head h and tail τ are given. Since they're moving right, the head is larger than the tail? Let me check the notation.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h], so h is the head, which is the front, so for right-moving, head h is larger than tail τ. Similarly for left, but all here are right-moving.\n\nIn the table, for example, freeway 1 has cars: (30,19,right,6) and (-36,-47,right,6). So for the first car, h=30, τ=19, so since moving right, at t_1=13, span is [19,30].\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=-36, τ=-47? That seems odd because -36 > -47, so τ=-47, h=-36, so span is [-47,-36].\n\nBut since they're moving right, the positions will increase over time.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, when I'm at y_T, and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, important: when I move, at turn T, if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, I'm not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I only care about cars on the freeway I'm currently on at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position (0, y_T). I take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nBut the collision is checked based on y_T: if at turn T, I am on freeway k, and for that freeway, at turn T, 0 is in the span of some car, then collision.\n\nAlso, when I move, during the turn, I might be between, but the problem says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", so at the exact turn T, I am on y_T for collision purposes.\n\nSimilarly, for the next turn, I'll be on y_{T+1}.\n\nSo for each turn T, I need to ensure that when I am on freeway k at that turn, 0 is not in the car span for that freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, the car spans change with time.\n\nLet t_1 = 13.\n\nFor any turn T ≥ t_1, the time elapsed is Δt = T - 13.\n\nFor a right-moving car with head h, tail τ at t_1, at time T, the span is [τ + 6*(T-13), h + 6*(T-13)]\n\nSimilarly for all cars.\n\nNow, collision if for freeway k at turn T, 0 is in [τ + 6*(T-13), h + 6*(T-13)] for some car on that freeway.\n\nSince the spans are intervals, I need to find when 0 is covered.\n\nAlso, I start at y=4 at turn 13.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is the top, I think y=9 is the goal, and no cars on y=9, I assume, since cars are on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, y=9 is the top.\n\nPlayer position: (0, y), with y from 0 to 9.\n\nAt y=0 and y=9, no cars, so I can be there safely.\n\nBut I need to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\nNow, I'm at y=4 at turn 13.\n\nI can move up, down, or stay, but moving down might not help since I need to go up to 9.\n\nBut to avoid cars, I might need to go down or stay sometimes.\n\nBut since all freeways have similar cars, I need to see the pattern.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars for each freeway.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars: (30,19,right,6) and (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same, (30,19,right,6) and (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nFreeway 3: same\n\nFreeway 4: same\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (30,19,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5\n\nFreeway 7: same as 5\n\nFreeway 8: same as 5\n\nFreeways 1 to 4 have two cars each, freeways 5 to 8 have three cars each.\n\nBut the cars are the same for multiple freeways, but since we care per freeway, I need to consider each freeway separately.\n\nFor a given freeway, at a given time, the car spans determine if 0 is covered.\n\nSince the cars are moving, the position where 0 is covered changes with time.\n\nI need to find, for each freeway, at each time, whether 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nThat is, if there is a car whose span includes 0 at that turn.\n\nFor simplicity, let Δt = T - 13, so for turn T, Δt = T - 13.\n\nFor a car with span at t_1: [τ, h] for right-moving.\n\nAt time T, span is [τ + 6*Δt, h + 6*Δt]\n\n0 is in span if τ + 6*Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + 6*Δt\n\nSince the car is moving right, and τ ≤ h, so this is equivalent to τ + 6*Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + 6*Δt, but since h > τ, it's τ + 6*Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + 6*Δt\n\nWhich means -h ≤ 6*Δt ≤ -τ\n\nFrom τ + 6*Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + 6*Δt, so 6*Δt ≤ -τ and 6*Δt ≥ -h\n\nSince τ and h could be negative, let's keep it.\n\nSo 6*Δt ≥ -h and 6*Δt ≤ -τ\n\nBecause from 0 ≤ h + 6*Δt, so 6*Δt ≥ -h\n\nAnd from τ + 6*Δt ≤ 0, so 6*Δt ≤ -τ\n\nAlso, since the car exists only for that span, but I think for collision, if 0 is in the span at time T, it's occupied.\n\nNow, for each car, I can find the time intervals when it covers 0.\n\nBut since multiple cars, I need the union over all cars on that freeway.\n\nThen for each freeway, I can find when it is safe, i.e., no car covering 0.\n\nFirst, let's handle freeways 1 to 4, which have two cars each: car A: (30,19,right,6) and car B: (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nFor car A: h=30, τ=19\n\nSo 0 covered when 6*Δt ≥ -30 and 6*Δt ≤ -19\n\nSince h=30, τ=19\n\n6*Δt ≥ -h = -30\n\n6*Δt ≤ -τ = -19\n\nBut -30 and -19, since Δt ≥0, 6*Δt ≥0, so -30 ≤ 6*Δt ≤ -19? But 6*Δt ≥0, and -19 <0, so 6*Δt ≤ -19 is impossible since left side non-neg, right side negative.\n\nSimilarly, 6*Δt ≥ -30 is always true for Δt ≥0 since -30<0.\n\nBut 6*Δt ≤ -19 <0, which is impossible for Δt ≥0.\n\nSo for car A, 0 is never covered? That can't be right.\n\nLet me think.\n\nCar A at t_1: span [19,30], so positions 19 to 30, all positive, moving right, so at future times, span [19 +6Δt, 30+6Δt], all positions increasing from 19, so since 19>0, and moving right, 0 is always left of the span, so 0 never in [19+6Δt, 30+6Δt] for Δt≥0.\n\nSimilarly, for car B: h=-36, τ=-47? τ=-47, h=-36, so at t_1, span [-47,-36], all negative, moving right.\n\nAt time T, span [-47 +6Δt, -36 +6Δt]\n\n0 in span if -47 +6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -36 +6Δt\n\nWhich is 6Δt ≤ 47 and 0 ≤ -36 +6Δt so 6Δt ≥36\n\nAnd -47 +6Δt ≤0 so 6Δt ≤47\n\n0 ≤ -36 +6Δt so 6Δt ≥36\n\nSo 36 ≤ 6Δt ≤47\n\nThus Δt between 36/6=6 and 47/6≈7.833\n\nSo for car B, 0 is covered when 6 ≤ Δt ≤ 7.833, so at turns T=13+6=19 to T=13+7=20, since Δt integer? Turns are discrete, I think.\n\nΔt = T - t_1, T integer, so Δt integer.\n\nT=13 + Δt, Δt integer >=0.\n\nFor car B, 6Δt >=36 and 6Δt <=47, so Δt >=6 and Δt <=7 since 47/6=7.833, so 6Δt <=47.833? 6*7=42, 6*8=48.\n\n6Δt >=36, Δt >=6\n\n6Δt <=47, since 6*7=42 <=47, 6*8=48>47? 48>47, so 6Δt <=47.\n\n6Δt <=47, with Δt integer, so 6Δt <=47, max Δt=7 since 42<=47, 48>47.\n\nSimilarly, min Δt=6.\n\n6*6=36, 36>=36, and 36<=47? 36<=47 yes.\n\n6*7=42, 42<=47 yes.\n\n6*8=48>47, not <=47.\n\nSo Δt=6 and 7.\n\nThus for car B, 0 covered at Δt=6 and 7, i.e., T=19 and T=20.\n\nNow for car A, as above, never covers 0.\n\nTherefore for freeway 1, only car B can cover 0, at T=19 and 20.\n\nBut freeway 1 has two cars, car A and car B, car A never covers 0, car B covers at T=19,20.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe at T=19 and T=20.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2,3,4 same cars, so same: unsafe only at T=19 and 20.\n\nNow freeways 5 to 8 have three cars: car A: (30,19,right,6) same as before, car C: (-48,-59,right,6), car D: (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nFirst, car A: same as before, never covers 0.\n\nCar C: h=-48? τ=-59, h=-48? Span at t_1: [-59,-48], moving right.\n\nAt T, span [-59 +6Δt, -48 +6Δt]\n\n0 in span if -59 +6Δt <=0 <= -48 +6Δt\n\nSo 6Δt <=59 and 6Δt >=48\n\nThus 48 <= 6Δt <=59\n\nΔt >= 48/6=8, Δt <=59/6≈9.833\n\nSo Δt=8,9\n\nSince 6*8=48, 6*9=54<=59, 6*10=60>59.\n\n6Δt <=59, 6*9=54<=59, 6*10=60>59, so Δt=8,9\n\nSimilarly, 6Δt >=48, Δt>=8.\n\nSo Δt=8,9, T=13+8=21, 13+9=22.\n\nCar D: (-12,-23,right,6), so τ=-23, h=-12? Span at t_1: [-23,-12], moving right.\n\nAt T, span [-23 +6Δt, -12 +6Δt]\n\n0 in span if -23 +6Δt <=0 <= -12 +6Δt\n\nSo 6Δt <=23 and 6Δt >=12\n\nThus 12 <= 6Δt <=23\n\nΔt >=12/6=2, Δt <=23/6≈3.833\n\nSo Δt=2,3\n\nT=13+2=15, 13+3=16.\n\nNow car A never.\n\nSo for freeways 5-8, unsafe when car C or D covers 0, i.e., at T=15,16 (from car D) and T=21,22 (from car C)\n\nT=15,16,21,22.\n\nBut car D at T=15,16, car C at T=21,22.\n\nAnd no overlap, so unsafe at T=15,16,21,22.\n\nNow, summary per freeway:\n\nFor freeway y=1: unsafe at T=19,20\n\ny=2: same, unsafe at 19,20\n\ny=3: same\n\ny=4: same\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=15,16,21,22\n\ny=6: same\n\ny=7: same\n\ny=8: same\n\nNow, I am at y=4 at T=13.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so safe anytime.\n\nBut I need to be at (0,9) at some turn.\n\nThe player position: at turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nI start at T=13, y=4.\n\nI take actions: at each turn, I choose U, D, or S, which changes y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must be in [0,9], so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nSince I need to reach y=9, and I'm at y=4, I need to move up at least 5 times, but I might stay or move down to avoid bad times.\n\nMinimal H: since I need to increase y by 5, minimal actions: 5 up moves, but I might need to wait, so H could be more than 5.\n\nH is the number of turns from t_1, so at turn t_1 + H -1, I reach y=9.\n\nLet me denote the sequence.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nT starts from 13.\n\ny_13 = 4.\n\nI need y_{13 + K} = 9 for some K, and I want min K, then H = K+1? Let's see.\n\nAfter H turns, from t=0 to H-1, so after H actions, I have done H moves.\n\nAt turn t_1, before any action, I am at (0,y_{t_1})\n\nThen I take action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}, and so on, up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, after which I am at y_{t_1 + H -1} =9? Let's read.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t_1 +0, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H-1}, I am at y_{t_1 + H}, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the indexing.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position y_T.\n\nI take action a_T, which causes y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nSo after action at T, I move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe sequence is given for actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, so after H actions, I am at turn t_1 + H, with y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut I need to reach (0,9), so y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see the problem.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\n\"such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H-1}, I am at y_{t_1 + H}, but the position at turn t_1 + H -1 is before action a_{t_1 + H-1}? I'm confused.\n\nStandard: at the start of turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nI take action a_T, which updates to y_{T+1} for the start of turn T+1.\n\nSo at turn T, position is y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, I go to y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nNow, I start at turn t_1, position y_{t_1} =4.\n\nI take actions a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to a_{t_1 + H-1}, and after that, at turn t_1 + H, I am at y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut I need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9? Let's read carefully.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\n\"such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nAnd the actions are from t=0 to H-1: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1, I am at y_{t_1}, I take a_{t_1}, go to y_{t_1 +1} at turn t_1 +1.\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, I am at y_{t_1 +1}, take a_{t_1 +1}, go to y_{t_1 +2}, and so on.\n\nAfter taking a_{t_1 + H-1}, I go to y_{t_1 + H} at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut the position at turn t_1 + H -1 is y_{t_1 + H -1}, which is before taking a_{t_1 + H-1}.\n\nI need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThat means at turn t_1 + H -1, I am at (0,9), and I don't need to take further action, I think.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}, and at turn t_1 + H -1, after or before action?\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, then I take action a_T, which updates to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H -1, I am at y_{t_1 + H -1}, and if this is 9, I have reached, but I still take action a_{t_1 + H-1}, which might move me, but since I need to be at 9 at that turn, I should take S or something.\n\nIf at turn t_1 + H -1, I am at y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, and I take action, say a_{t_1 + H-1} = S, then y_{t_1 + H} =9, but I don't care about after.\n\nThe condition is y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd I take H actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nFor example, minimal case: if I could go directly to 9 in 5 ups, but let's see.\n\nAt T=13, y=4.\n\nIf I take U, go to y=5 at T=14.\n\nTake U, to y=6 at T=15, and so on.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on a freeway when it is unsafe.\n\nNow, y=4 is freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=4 is freeway 4, which has cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 to 8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 no cars.\n\nAt y=0 or 9, no collision possible.\n\nBack to the path.\n\nI am at y=4 at T=13.\n\nFreeway 4 is unsafe only at T=19,20, so at T=13, it is safe, since not 19 or 20.\n\nI need to go up to y=9.\n\ny=5 to y=8 are freeways 5 to 8.\n\nFor y=5, unsafe at T=15,16,21,22\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8 same.\n\ny=9 safe always.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince I start at y=4, and need to be at y=9, I must pass through y=5,6,7,8 or go directly, but I can only change by 1 each turn, so I must go through each level.\n\nI can stay or go down, but that might increase H.\n\nTo minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a bad freeway at bad times.\n\nMinimal H: if no cars, I can go up 5 times in 5 turns: actions U,U,U,U,U, then at T=13, y=4; after U, T=14 y=5; U T=15 y=6; U T=16 y=7; U T=17 y=8; U T=18 y=9. So at turn T=18, y=9, which is t_1 + H -1 =13 + H -1 =18, so 12 + H =18, H=6? t_1 + H -1 =13 + H -1 =12 + H.\n\nSet equal to 18, so 12 + H =18, H=6.\n\nActions from t=0 to 5: a13 to a18? a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nt_1 + H -1 =18, so H-1 =5, H=6.\n\nActions at T=13 to 18, but at T=18, action a18, then to y19, but position at turn 18 is before action, y18.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 13, take a13, go to y14 at turn 14.\n\nAt turn 14, take a14, go to y15 at turn 15, and so on.\n\nAt turn 18, I am at y18, and if y18=9, I need to be there.\n\nIn the direct path: at T=13, y13=4, take U, go to y14=5 at T=14\n\nAt T=14, y14=5, take U, go to y15=6 at T=15\n\nAt T=15, y15=6, take U, go to y16=7 at T=16\n\nAt T=16, y16=7, take U, go to y17=8 at T=17\n\nAt T=17, y17=8, take U, go to y18=9 at T=18\n\nSo at turn 18, I am at y18=9, which is t_1 + H -1 =13 + H -1 =18, so 12 + H =18, H=6.\n\nBut now, I need to check if at each turn, when I am on a freeway, it is safe.\n\nAt T=13, I am on y=4, freeway 4, which is safe except at T=19,20, so T=13 safe.\n\nAt T=14, I am on y=5, freeway 5, unsafe at T=15,16,21,22. T=14 is not in {15,16,21,22}, so safe.\n\nAt T=15, I am on y=6, freeway 6, which is unsafe at T=15,16,21,22. T=15 is unsafe! Because at T=15, for freeway 5-8, car D covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, at T=16, on y=7, freeway 7, unsafe at T=16.\n\nSo in this path, at T=15, on y=6, collision; T=16 on y=7, collision.\n\nSo not safe.\n\nTherefore, I cannot go directly up at that time.\n\nI need to delay or change path.\n\nMinimal H might be larger.\n\nI need to avoid being on freeways 5-8 at T=15 and T=16.\n\nSimilarly, later at T=21,22, but since I'm going up, if I can reach y=9 before T=21, I might not be affected.\n\nT=21 is later.\n\nFirst, let's list the unsafe times for each y:\n\ny=1: unsafe T=19,20\n\ny=2: same\n\ny=3: same\n\ny=4: unsafe T=19,20\n\ny=5: unsafe T=15,16,21,22\n\ny=6: same\n\ny=7: same\n\ny=8: same\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nI am at y=4 at T=13, safe.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nOne way is to go up as fast as possible, but avoid T=15,16 on y=5-8.\n\nSince y=5-8 are all unsafe at T=15,16, I should not be on any of them at T=15 or T=16.\n\nThat means, at turn T=15 and T=16, I should be on y=0,1,2,3,4 or 9.\n\nBut y=0-4 might be safe or not.\n\nSpecifically, at T=15 and T=16:\n\ny=1: unsafe only at 19,20, so safe at 15,16\n\ny=2: safe\n\ny=3: safe\n\ny=4: unsafe at 19,20, so safe at 15,16\n\ny=0: safe\n\ny=9: safe\n\nBut I need to be on the way to 9.\n\nSo for T=15 and T=16, I can be on y=0,1,2,3,4 or 9.\n\nBut if I am on y=9 at T=15 or 16, that might be fine, but I start from y=4 at T=13.\n\nI can stay or move down to avoid being on y=5-8 at T=15,16.\n\nThen after T=16, I can go up.\n\nT=15 and 16 are the critical points.\n\nNow, from T=13: I am at y=4.\n\nOption 1: at T=13, take S or D to stay or go down, so that at T=14, I am on lower y.\n\nThen at T=14, take action to be safe at T=15 and 16.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut let's think about the times.\n\nTurn T=13: position y=4, safe.\n\nI take action a13.\n\nIf I take U, go to y=5 at T=14.\n\nAt T=14, on y=5, which is safe since unsafe only 15,16,21,22, T=14 not included.\n\nThen at T=14, I take action for T=15.\n\nIf I take U, go to y=6 at T=15, but at T=15 on y=6, unsafe.\n\nIf I take S at T=14, then stay at y=5 for T=15, but at T=15 on y=5, unsafe.\n\nIf I take D at T=14, go to y=4 at T=15, then at T=15 on y=4, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=15, on y=4, safe.\n\nThen I can go up later.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nSimilarly, at T=16, I need to be safe.\n\nAnother option: from T=13, take D to go down to y=3 at T=14, but y=3 is freeway, unsafe only at 19,20, so safe at T=14.\n\nThen from there.\n\nBut going down might delay.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, I could go to y=0 and wait, but that takes more turns.\n\nMinimal H, so I should minimize waiting.\n\nNow, let's find a sequence.\n\nFirst, I must avoid being on y=5,6,7,8 at T=15 and T=16.\n\nAt T=17 and later, y=5-8 are safe except at T=21,22, which are later, so if I can reach y=9 before T=21, I might not care.\n\nT=21 is 13+8=21, which is after.\n\nIn the direct path, I could reach y=9 at T=18, which is before 21, so T=21,22 not issue if I arrive early.\n\nBut in direct path, I have problem at T=15,16.\n\nSo I need to handle T=15 and 16.\n\nIdea: at T=15 and T=16, be on a safe y, like y=4 or below or y=9.\n\nBut at T=13, I am at y=4.\n\nI can stay at y=4 for a few turns.\n\nFor example, at T=13, take S, so stay at y=4 for T=14? At T=13, take S, then y14=4, so at turn T=14, I am at y=4.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAt T=13, y=4, take S, go to y=4 at T=14.\n\nAt T=14, I am at y=4, which is safe.\n\nNow, at T=14, I need to take action for T=15.\n\nIf I take S, go to y=4 at T=15, safe.\n\nThen at T=15, on y=4, safe.\n\nBut at T=16, I need to be safe.\n\nAt T=15, I can take action.\n\nIf I stay, at T=16, y=4, safe.\n\nThen I can start going up.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y=4, to y=9, need 5 up moves.\n\nBut if I start going up at T=15, for example.\n\nAt T=15, on y=4, take U, go to y=5 at T=16.\n\nAt T=16, on y=5, but y=5 is unsafe at T=16! Because T=16 is unsafe for y=5-8.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf at T=15, on y=4, I take U, go to y=5 at T=16, then at T=16 on y=5, unsafe.\n\nIf I take S at T=15, stay at y=4 for T=16, safe, but not progressing.\n\nThen at T=16, on y=4, I can take U to go to y=5 at T=17.\n\nAt T=17, on y=5, which is safe? y=5 unsafe at T=15,16,21,22. T=17 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, then I can go up.\n\nLet's see the turns.\n\nStart: T=13, y=4, safe.\n\nTake action: suppose I take S at T=13, so go to y=4 at T=14.\n\nT=14: y=4, safe.\n\nTake S again? Or U.\n\nTo avoid being on y=5 at T=16.\n\nAt T=14, I am at y=4.\n\nIf I take U at T=14, go to y=5 at T=15.\n\nThen at T=15 on y=5, unsafe! Not good.\n\nIf I take S at T=14, go to y=4 at T=15.\n\nT=15: y=4, safe.\n\nThen at T=15, I take U, go to y=5 at T=16.\n\nT=16: on y=5, but T=16 unsafe for y=5, collision.\n\nIf at T=15, I take S, go to y=4 at T=16.\n\nT=16: y=4, safe.\n\nThen at T=16, take U, go to y=5 at T=17.\n\nT=17: on y=5, safe (since unsafe only 15,16,21,22, T=17 ok).\n\nThen from here, I can go up to y=9 quickly.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt T=17, y=5, take U, go to y=6 at T=18\n\nT=18, y=6, take U, go to y=7 at T=19\n\nBut T=19, on y=7? y=7 is unsafe at T=19? Freeways 5-8 unsafe at T=21,22? Earlier.\n\ny=5-8 unsafe at T=15,16,21,22.\n\nT=19 not unsafe, so safe.\n\nSimilarly T=20 safe for y=5-8.\n\nUnsafe at T=21,22.\n\nT=19 and 20 are safe.\n\nNow, back to sequence.\n\nAfter T=17, y=5:\n\nT=17: y=5, take U, go to y=6 at T=18\n\nT=18: y=6, take U, go to y=7 at T=19\n\nT=19: y=7, take U, go to y=8 at T=20\n\nT=20: y=8, take U, go to y=9 at T=21\n\nBut at T=21, I am at y=9, which is safe.\n\ny=9 no cars.\n\nBut I need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt T=21, y=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =13 + H -1 =21, so 12 + H =21, H=9.\n\nBut earlier, at T=21, y=9, which is fine.\n\nBut let's see the actions.\n\nFrom above:\n\nI had to wait at y=4 for a few turns.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nT=13: start y=4, take S? Or what.\n\nIn the sequence I thought: at T=13, I need to take action to be safe.\n\nIf at T=13, take S, go to y=4 at T=14.\n\nThen at T=14, take S, go to y=4 at T=15? Or at T=14 take something.\n\nTo minimize, I can take only necessary stays.\n\nFrom T=13: y=4\n\nIf I take D, go to y=3 at T=14, but y=3 is safe, but then I have to come back, might take more turns.\n\nBetter to stay or move carefully.\n\nSince at T=15 and 16, I need to be on y<=4 or y=9, but y=9 far.\n\nSo stay on y=4 during T=15 and 16.\n\nFor that, I need to be at y=4 at T=15 and T=16.\n\nAt T=13, y=4, I can take S at T=13 to stay at y=4 for T=14.\n\nThen at T=14, I need to be at y=4 for T=15 and T=16.\n\nAt T=14, if I take S, go to y=4 at T=15.\n\nThen at T=15, if I take S, go to y=4 at T=16.\n\nThen at T=16, take U, go to y=5 at T=17.\n\nAs before.\n\nNow, from T=17: y=5, take U to y=6 at T=18\n\nT=18: y=6, take U to y=7 at T=19\n\nT=19: y=7, take U to y=8 at T=20\n\nT=20: y=8, take U to y=9 at T=21\n\nAt T=21, y=9.\n\nNow, t_1 + H -1 =21, t_1=13, so 13 + H -1=21, 12+H=21, H=9.\n\nBut at T=20, I am at y=8, which is freeway 8, unsafe at T=21,22? At T=20, I am on y=8, and take action to go to y=9 at T=21.\n\nAt turn T=20, position y=8, which is safe? T=20, for y=8, unsafe at T=21,22? T=20 not unsafe, since unsafe times 15,16,21,22, so T=20 safe.\n\nThen I take U, go to y=9 at T=21.\n\nAt T=21, y=9, safe.\n\nH=9, but is this minimal?\n\nI could reach earlier.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=4 and stay only when necessary.\n\nAt T=13, y=4, safe.\n\nI take U, go to y=5 at T=14.\n\nAt T=14, on y=5, safe (T=14 not 15 or 16).\n\nNow, at T=14, I need to avoid being on y=5-8 at T=15.\n\nBut at T=14, I am on y=5.\n\nIf I take D, go to y=4 at T=15.\n\nThen at T=15, on y=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=15, on y=4, I can take action.\n\nIf I take U, go to y=5 at T=16, but at T=16 on y=5 unsafe.\n\nSo take S or D.\n\nIf take S at T=15, go to y=4 at T=16, safe.\n\nThen at T=16, take U to y=5 at T=17.\n\nSame as before.\n\nFrom T=14, after going to y=5 at T=14, if I take S at T=14, stay at y=5 for T=15, but at T=15 on y=5 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nTake D to y=4 at T=15, safe.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nSo same as before.\n\nCan I go to y=9 before T=21?\n\nT=21 is when I arrive in the above sequence.\n\nBut y=5-8 unsafe at T=21,22, but if I reach y=9 at T=18, for example, I avoid that.\n\nBut earlier, I was blocked at T=15,16.\n\nSo if I can be on y=9 by T=18, but to do that, I need to be on y=8 at T=17, etc., but at T=15 and 16, I need to be on low y.\n\nSuppose I start at T=13 y=4.\n\nTake U to y=5 at T=14.\n\nBut then at T=15, I must not be on y=5-8, so I must move down or stay to be on y=4 or below.\n\nBut from y=5, I can take D to y=4 at T=15.\n\nThen at T=15, on y=4, safe.\n\nThen at T=15, I can take S to stay for T=16, but at T=16 I need to be safe.\n\nAt T=15, on y=4, take D to y=3 at T=16? But y=3 safe at T=16.\n\nThen at T=16, on y=3, I can take U to y=4 at T=17, etc., but this takes more down moves, more turns.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo best to stay around y=4 during T=15 and 16.\n\nIn the sequence, I have to spend T=15 and T=16 at y=4 or below, but y=4 is fine.\n\nThen from T=17, go up to y=9 in 4 turns? From y=4 to y=9 is 5 steps, but I start from T=17 at y=4? No.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=16, I am at y=4 (after taking actions).\n\nLet's list the turns and positions.\n\nTurn T | position y_T | action a_T | notes\n\nT=13: y=4, take a13\n\nAfter a13, go to y_{14}\n\nI need to specify actions.\n\nSet T=13: y=4, take S, so y14=4\n\nT=14: y=4, take S, so y15=4\n\nT=15: y=4, take S, so y16=4  (now safe at T=15 and T=16)\n\nBut at T=15 and T=16, I am at y=4, safe.\n\nNow, at T=16: y=4, I take U, so go to y=5 at T=17\n\nT=17: y=5, take U, go to y=6 at T=18\n\nT=18: y=6, take U, go to y=7 at T=19\n\nT=19: y=7, take U, go to y=8 at T=20\n\nT=20: y=8, take U, go to y=9 at T=21\n\nAt T=21, y=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =21, H=9 as before.\n\nBut at T=19, y=7, and freeway 7, unsafe at T=19? No, for y=5-8, unsafe at 15,16,21,22, so T=19 safe.\n\nT=20 safe.\n\nBut I arrived at T=21.\n\nCan I arrive earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be at higher y earlier.\n\nBut at T=15 and 16, I have to be at low y, so I cannot be moving up during that time.\n\nUnless I go directly to y=9 before T=15, but I start at T=13 y=4, to y=9 in 5 moves, at T=18, but to be at y=9 at T=18, I need to be on the way, but at T=15 I would be at y=6 or something, which is unsafe.\n\nSpecifically, to reach y=9 at T=18, I need y18=9.\n\nThen y17=8, y16=7, y15=6, y14=5, y13=4.\n\nBut at T=15, y=6, unsafe; T=16 y=7, unsafe.\n\nSo impossible to reach before T=17 or later.\n\nAt T=17, if y=9, then y16=8, y15=7, y14=6, y13=5? But at T=13 I am at y=4, not y=5.\n\nTo have y17=9, then y16=8, y15=7, y14=6, y13=5, but I start at y13=4, contradiction.\n\ny at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nTo have y_T=9 for some T.\n\ny_T=9 means at turn T I am at 9.\n\nThen at turn T-1, I was at some y, and took action to go to 9.\n\nBut y_{T-1} could be 8 or 9 or 10, but y=10 invalid, so y_{T-1} =8 or 9.\n\nIf y_{T-1}=8, take U to y_T=9.\n\nIf y_{T-1}=9, take S or D, but to reach, probably from 8.\n\nSimilarly, to be at 8 at T-1, etc.\n\nEarliest possible: from y13=4, if I take all U, y14=5, y15=6, y16=7, y17=8, y18=9. So at T=18, y=9.\n\nBut y15=6 and y16=7 unsafe.\n\nIf I can have y17=9, then y16=8, y15=7, y14=6, y13=5, but y13=4, not 5, impossible.\n\ny17=9 requires y16=8 or 9, so y15=7 or 8 or something, but from y13=4, min to y17=9 is 4 steps? y13=4, after action to y14, y15, y16, y17.\n\n4 actions: a13 to a16, y17=9.\n\ny13=4, take U, y14=5; U y15=6; U y16=7; U y17=8? y17=8, then need another U to y18=9.\n\nTo have y17=9, need y16=8 and take U, or y16=9 and take S, but not reaching.\n\ny16 must be 8 to reach y17=9 with U.\n\ny16=8 requires y15=7 or 8 or 9, but y15=7 with U from y14=6.\n\ny14=6 from y13=5 with U.\n\nBut y13=4, not 5. So from y13=4, y14 min 3,4,5; to y14=5, then y15=6, y16=7, y17=8, y18=9. So y17=9 impossible, earliest y18=9 with 5 up moves.\n\nSimilarly, y19=9 with fewer up but some stay or down, but same or more turns.\n\nSo minimal turns to reach is 5, but with cars, I need to take more.\n\nBack to the sequence.\n\nIn my earlier sequence, I arrive at T=21 with H=9.\n\nBut I have two extra stays: at T=13 and T=14 or something.\n\nIn the sequence I have: I stayed at y=4 from T=13 to T=16? Let's see:\n\nT=13: y=4, take S → y14=4\n\nT=14: y=4, take S → y15=4\n\nT=15: y=4, take S → y16=4\n\nThen T=16: y=4, take U → y17=5\n\nT=17: y=5, take U → y18=6\n\nT=18: y=6, take U → y19=7\n\nT=19: y=7, take U → y20=8\n\nT=20: y=8, take U → y21=9\n\nSo at T=21, y=9.\n\nI took three S at T=13,14,15? Actions: a13=S, a14=S, a15=S, a16=U, a17=U, a18=U, a19=U, a20=U.\n\nThen y21=9, so t_1 + H -1 =13 + H -1=21, H=9.\n\nBut I took actions from a13 to a20, that's 8 actions? t from 0 to H-1, H actions.\n\na13 to a_{13+H-1} = a20, so 13+H-1=20, H-1=7, H=8? Messed up.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =20? Position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, at turn T=21, y=9, so t_1 + H -1 =21.\n\nt_1=13, so 13 + H -1 =21, 12 + H =21, H=9.\n\nActions: from t=0 to 8, a_{13} to a_{13+8}=a_{21}? No.\n\nSequence {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at times t_1 + t.\n\nSo for H=9, t=0 to 8, actions at T=13+0=13 to 13+8=21.\n\nBut after a21, I go to y22, but the position at turn t_1 + H -1 =13+9-1=21, which is y21.\n\nIn the action sequence, a13 to a21, but a21 is taken at turn 21, which determines y22.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet the actions be taken at turns: action at time T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe sequence is actions for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter taking these H actions, the position at turn t_1 + H is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut I need position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nThat is, at turn K = t_1 + H -1, y_K =9.\n\nAnd actions from a_{t_1} to a_{K}, since K = t_1 + H -1, so actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which is a_{K}.\n\nFor example, if K=18, y18=9, actions a13 to a17, since a17 determines y18.\n\na17 taken at T=17, determines y18.\n\nThen at turn 18, position y18=9.\n\nActions a13 to a17, that's 5 actions, H=5? t from 0 to H-1, a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}.\n\nFor K=18, t_1 + H -1 =18, 13 + H -1=18, H-1=5, H=6.\n\nActions a13 to a18? a_{t_1 + H-1} = a_{18}\n\na18 taken at T=18, determines y19.\n\nBut position at turn 18 is y18, which is before a18.\n\nTo have y18=9, it is determined by a17: if at T=17, y17, take a17, then y18 = y17 + Delta.\n\nSo to have y18=9, it depends on a17 and y17.\n\nSimilarly, the last action is a_{K} for turn K, which determines y_{K+1}, but y_K is the position before a_K.\n\nIn the sequence, for position at turn M to be 9, it is set by the previous actions.\n\nBut in the output, we need the actions such that at some turn, y=9.\n\nAnd the turn is t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn the action sequence, actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}, and after that, at turn t_1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nThat means, the action at t_1 + H-1 is taken, and after that, at that turn, position is 9? No.\n\nAt the start of turn T, position y_T.\n\nTake action a_T, go to y_{T+1} for start of turn T+1.\n\nSo at turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter taking a_T, position changes to y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nFor turn M = t_1 + H -1, y_M =9.\n\nThe actions are from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1} = a_M.\n\na_M is taken at turn M, which determines y_{M+1}, but y_M is already set before taking a_M.\n\nSo to have y_M=9, it must be that from previous actions, we arrived at y_M=9, and then we take a_M, which could be S, U, or D, but if we take U or D, y_{M+1} changes, but we don't care, since we only need y_M=9 at turn M.\n\nSo a_M can be S, U, or D, but if we take U or D, it might move away, but the position at turn M is 9, which is what we want.\n\nFor example, at turn M, y_M=9, we take a_M=S, then y_{M+1}=9, or take U, y_{M+1}=10 invalid, so we should take S or D to stay, but D to 8, not 9, so better to take S or U if possible, but U to 10 invalid, so must take S or D, but D moves down, so to keep position, take S.\n\nBut the condition is only to reach at turn M, so even if we take U or D, as long as at turn M we are at 9, it's fine, but after that it changes, but we don't care.\n\nBut to be safe, probably take S at that turn.\n\nBut in terms of collision, at turn M, if we are at y_M=9, no cars, safe, so any action is fine, but to end, take S.\n\nBut for the sequence, we can take U or D, but it might cause issue if we move, but since we reach at M, and actions include a_M, but the position is before action.\n\nSo for safety, at turn M, position 9, safe, then take a_M, which doesn't affect the position at M.\n\nSo it's ok.\n\nBack to the path.\n\nIn my sequence, I have to be at y=4 from T=13 to T=16, then go up.\n\nBut at T=13, I can take action to go up, but not to y=5-8 at T=15.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=3 or lower during T=15,16, but that might not help.\n\nOr go to y=0.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach earlier than T=21.\n\nFor example, after T=16, I go up, but from y=4 at T=16, take U to y=5 at T=17, U to y=6 at T=18, U to y=7 at T=19, U to y=8 at T=20, U to y=9 at T=21, same as before.\n\nCan I be at higher y at T=17?\n\nFor example, if at T=14, I am at y=5, but at T=15 I must go down to y=4, so at T=15 I am at y=4.\n\nThen at T=15, I can take U to y=5 at T=16, but T=16 unsafe for y=5.\n\nSo I cannot.\n\nUnless I go to y=9 directly, impossible.\n\nOr, I could go down to y=0 at some point, but that takes more turns.\n\nFor example, at T=13, take D to y=3 at T=14, then D to y=2 at T=15, then at T=15 on y=2, safe, but then I have to go back up, so more turns, worse.\n\nSo the sequence with H=9 seems reasonable.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe times for y=4.\n\ny=4 unsafe at T=19,20.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=19, I am at y=7, not y=4.\n\nAt T=20, y=8.\n\ny=7 and 8 are safe at T=19,20, since unsafe only 15,16,21,22.\n\nT=21 is when I am at y=9, safe.\n\nIn the sequence to T=21, I used 8 actions? Let's count the actions.\n\nFrom T=13 to T=20, I take actions a13 to a20.\n\na13: S, to y14=4\n\na14: S, to y15=4\n\na15: S, to y16=4\n\na16: U, to y17=5\n\na17: U, to y18=6\n\na18: U, to y19=7\n\na19: U, to y20=8\n\na20: U, to y21=9\n\nAt turn T=20, position y20=8, which is at turn 20.\n\nI need y at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nHere at turn 20, y=8, not 9.\n\nAfter a20, I go to y21=9 at turn 21.\n\nSo at turn 21, y=9.\n\nTurn 21 is t_1 + H -1? t_1=13, so 13 + H -1 =21, H=9.\n\nActions from a13 to a20, that's 8 actions? t from 0 to 8, that's 9 actions: t=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 for H=9.\n\nActions at T=13+0=13, 13+1=14, ..., 13+8=21.\n\na13, a14, a15, a16, a17, a18, a19, a20, a21? No.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, H actions.\n\nFor H=9, t=0 to 8, actions at t_1 + t = 13 + t for t=0 to 8: so T=13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21.\n\nBut a21 at T=21 determines y22.\n\nBut position at turn 21 is y21, which is set by previous actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, with a13 to a20, I have actions up to a20, which determines y21.\n\nThen at turn 21, y21=9.\n\nThen for H=9, I need actions up to a_{t_1 + H-1} = a_{13+8} = a21.\n\nBut a21 is not taken yet in the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, to have y21=9, I need to specify a13 to a20.\n\nThen a21 is not needed for reaching, but the action sequence must include up to a_{t_1 + H-1} for the turn when I reach.\n\nIf I reach at turn K, then actions from a_{t_1} to a_{K}, since a_K is taken at turn K, but y_K is before a_K.\n\nFor turn K, y_K=9, then I take a_K.\n\nIn the action sequence for H, it should include a_K.\n\nFor example, if K=21, y21=9, then actions a13 to a21.\n\na21 can be S, for example.\n\nIn my sequence, with a13 to a20 as above, y21=9, so at turn 21, y=9, then I take a21, which can be S, U, or D, but U to 10 invalid, so S or D, better S.\n\nSo add a21=S.\n\nThen H=9, actions a13 to a21.\n\na13: S, a14: S, a15: S, a16: U, a17: U, a18: U, a19: U, a20: U, a21: S\n\nBut a21=S, then y22=9, but we don't care.\n\nPosition at turn 21 is 9.\n\nNow, is there a shorter sequence?\n\nSuppose I start by going up at T=13.\n\nT=13: y=4, take U, go to y=5 at T=14\n\nT=14: y=5, now at T=14, safe. Then I must avoid T=15 on y=5-8.\n\nSo at T=14, take D, go to y=4 at T=15\n\nT=15: y=4, safe. Then at T=15, I can take S, go to y=4 at T=16, safe.\n\nThen at T=16, take U to y=5 at T=17\n\nThen T=17: y=5, U to y=6 at T=18\n\nT=18: y=6, U to y=7 at T=19\n\nT=19: y=7, U to y=8 at T=20\n\nT=20: y=8, U to y=9 at T=21\n\nSame as before, but I used one less S? Let's see actions:\n\na13: U (to y14=5)\n\na14: D (to y15=4)\n\na15: S (to y16=4)  // I took S to stay at y=4 for T=16\n\na16: U (to y17=5)\n\na17: U (to y18=6)\n\na18: U (to y19=7)\n\na19: U (to y20=8)\n\na20: U (to y21=9)\n\nThen at turn T=20, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y21=9 at turn 21, I need a21, but a20 U to y21=9.\n\nThen for H, if I want turn 21, y21=9, then actions a13 to a21.\n\na21 can be S.\n\nIn this sequence, a13:U, a14:D, a15:S, a16:U, a17:U, a18:U, a19:U, a20:U, a21:S\n\nH=9 same as before.\n\nCompared to previous with three S at start, now I have U,D,S, so different actions but same number of turns.\n\nCan I reach at turn 20?\n\ny20=9.\n\nThen y19 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y19=8, take U to y20=9.\n\ny19=8 requires y18=7 or 8 or 9, etc.\n\nFrom start, y13=4.\n\ny20=9, so from y13 to y20, 7 steps? Positions from turn 13 to turn 20.\n\nAt turn 20, y20.\n\nTo reach y20=9, from y13=4, need at least 5 up moves, so at least 5 actions, but with possible stays or down.\n\nEarliest: all U from T=13 to T=17: y14=5, y15=6, y16=7, y17=8, y18=9? y18=9, not y20.\n\nTo y20=9: for example, stay or something.\n\ny13=4, take S, y14=4; S y15=4; then U y16=5; U y17=6; U y18=7; U y19=8; U y20=9.\n\nBut at T=15, y=4 safe; T=16 y=5, but T=16 unsafe for y=5, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\ny13=4, U y14=5; then at T=14, take D, y15=4; then U y16=5, but T=16 y=5 unsafe.\n\ny13=4, U y14=5; D y15=4; S y16=4; U y17=5; U y18=6; U y19=7; U y20=8; then need U to y21=9, so y20=8.\n\nTo have y20=9, need y19=8 and U, or y19=9 and S.\n\nBut y19=9 not possible from y13=4 in 6 steps with cars.\n\nMinimal without cars is 5 steps to y18=9.\n\nWith cars, blocked at T=15,16 for y=5-8.\n\nSo cannot reach before T=17 or later.\n\ny17=8 possible? y17=8, at turn 17.\n\nThen y16=7 or 8.\n\nBut at T=16, if y16=7, unsafe; if y16=8, unsafe at T=16 for y=8.\n\ny16 must be 7 or 8 to reach y17=8.\n\nBut at T=16, y=7 or 8 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if y16=8, take S to y17=8, but at T=16, position y16=8, unsafe.\n\nCannot be on y=7 or 8 at T=16.\n\nSimilarly for T=15.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=7 or 8 at T=15 or 16.\n\nTherefore, cannot have y17=8 or y18=9 before T=17.\n\nEarliest possible to start going up after T=16.\n\nAt T=17, I can be at y=5, as in the sequence, then y18=6, y19=7, y20=8, y21=9.\n\nSo y21=9 is the earliest possible.\n\nThus H=9 is minimal.\n\nIn the sequence, I can have different actions for the waiting.\n\nBut in terms of number, same.\n\nNow, for the action sequence.\n\nAlso, I need to output for the given turns.\n\nIn the first sequence, I had three S at the beginning.\n\nIn the second, I had U then D then S.\n\nBut H same.\n\nNow, about the later unsafe times.\n\nIn the sequence, when I go up, at T=19, y=7, but unsafe at T=21,22, but T=19 is fine.\n\nT=20 y=8, fine.\n\nT=21 y=9, fine.\n\nBut at T=19 and 20, I am on y=7 and 8, which are safe at those times.\n\nNow, for freeway 4, unsafe at T=19,20, but I am not on y=4 at that time, so ok.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the sequence works.\n\nTo minimize H, it seems 9 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can be at y=5 at T=17 with fewer actions.\n\nFor example, from T=13: y=4, take U to y=5 at T=14\n\nThen at T=14: take D to y=4 at T=15\n\nThen at T=15: take S to y=4 at T=16? Or take U, but cannot.\n\nThen at T=16: take U to y=5 at T=17\n\nSame as before.\n\nNo shorter.\n\nSo H=9.\n\nNow, for the actions, I need to specify.\n\nAlso, in the output, for each turn.\n\nNow, current turn t_1=13.\n\nSo actions from turn 13 to turn 13+8=21? For H=9, actions at t=13 to 21.\n\nBut turn 21 is included.\n\nIn the sequence, to reach at turn 21.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nSo for t_1=13.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 13: S (or U, but in this case)\n\nI can choose.\n\nTo have fewer changes, I can stay at y=4 for three turns.\n\nBut with U and D, same H.\n\nBut since minimal H, and we have to output the sequence.\n\nAlso, note that at T=19,20 for y=4 unsafe, but I am not there.\n\nIn the sequence, I am on y=4 from T=13 to T=16, which is safe since T<19.\n\nT=13,14,15,16 all <19.\n\nThen go up.\n\nNow, for the car states, I think I covered.\n\nBut let's double-check the car positions at critical points.\n\nFor example, at T=15, for freeway y=5, car D covers 0.\n\nCar D: at t_1=13, τ=-23, h=-12, s=6.\n\nAt T=15, Δt=2, span: [-23 +6*2, -12 +6*2] = [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11, 0]\n\n-11 <=0<=0, yes, 0 is included, so occupied.\n\nSimilarly at T=16, Δt=3, [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6], 0 in [-5,6], yes.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nIn my sequence, I avoid being on y=5-8 at those times.\n\nNow, output the sequence.\n\nI think H=9 is correct.\n\nBut in the action sequence, for the last action, since I reach at turn 21, I need to include a_{21}.\n\nSo let's write:\n\nActions:\n\nTo have y21=9.\n\nOne possible sequence:\n\nTurn 13: S  // stay at y=4\n\nTurn 14: S  // stay at y=4\n\nTurn 15: S  // stay at y=4\n\nTurn 16: U  // to y=5\n\nTurn 17: U  // to y=6\n\nTurn 18: U  // to y=7\n\nTurn 19: U  // to y=8\n\nTurn 20: U  // to y=9\n\nNow at turn 20, y=8, take U, go to y=9 at turn 21.\n\nAt turn 21, y=9, so I need to take action at turn 21, say S.\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 21, action a21=S.\n\nThen H=9.\n\nSince at turn 21, y=9, and I take S, it stays.\n\nIn the minimal sequence with U and D:\n\nTurn 13: U  // to y=5 at T=14\n\nTurn 14: D  // to y=4 at T=15\n\nTurn 15: S  // to y=4 at T=16\n\nTurn 16: U  // to y=5 at T=17\n\nTurn 17: U  // to y=6 at T=18\n\nTurn 18: U  // to y=7 at T=19\n\nTurn 19: U  // to y=8 at T=20\n\nTurn 20: U  // to y=9 at T=21\n\nThen at turn 21, y=9, take S:\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nSame H.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to box it.\n\nBut in the sequence, for the second one, I used U then D, which might be more actions, but H same.\n\nPerhaps the first with all S at start is simpler.\n\nBut let's see if I can save one turn by going to y=9 at T=20.\n\nBut earlier impossible.\n\nAnother thought: what about y=1 to 4 at T=19,20 unsafe, but in the sequence, I am not on them at that time.\n\nFor example, at T=19, I am on y=7, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think H=9 is minimal.\n\nSo for the sequence, I'll use the first one with stays.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nThen for turn 21, I need action, but at turn 20, after U, y21=9, so at turn 21, y=9, then take S.\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nIn the sequence, turns from 13 to 21.\n\nNumber of actions: 9.\n\nIn the output, it should be listed.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 13: S  \nTurn 14: S  \nTurn 15: S  \nTurn 16: U  \nTurn 17: U  \nTurn 18: U  \nTurn 19: U  \nTurn 20: U  \nTurn 21: S  \n}\n\nBut is turn 21 necessary? The position is reached at turn 21, so action at turn 21 is included.\n\nTo avoid the extra action, but since I need to specify until the turn I reach, and action at that turn.\n\nIn this case, with a21=S, it is fine.\n\nIf I can have y20=9, but impossible.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nPerhaps I can end at turn 20 with y=9, but not possible.\n\nSo H=9.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\) is 9. The sequence of actions avoids collisions by ensuring the player is not on freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) at turns 15 and 16 (when these freeways are unsafe due to car coverage at position 0), and not on freeway \\(y = 4\\) at turns 19 and 20 (when it is unsafe).

Importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9 with minimal turns, starting from y=4 at turn 14.\n\nNow, looking at the car states, it seems like for freeways 1 to 4, there are two cars each: both moving right with speed 6. For freeways 5 to 8, there are three cars each, all moving right with speed 6.\n\nLet me write down the car positions clearly.\n\nFor freeway k, cars are given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s). Since direction is right, and for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)].\n\nThe head and tail: for right-moving, head is the front, so h > τ, I assume? Let me see the values.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (36, 25, right, 6) and (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nSince direction is right, for the first car, head h=36, tail τ=25, so at t₁, span is [25, 36]? No.\n\nThe update rule: for right-moving, span at t₁ is [τ, h], and it moves to [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] at time T.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right-moving, so I don't need left.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, span is [τ, h] at t₁.\n\nFor first car on freeway 1: h=36, τ=25, so since right, span at t₁=14 is [25, 36].\n\nBut 25 to 36, that's from x=25 to x=36.\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=-30, τ=-41? That can't be right. h=-30, τ=-41, but if direction right, and τ is tail, h is head, so if moving right, head should be greater than tail, but -30 > -41, so span is [τ, h] = [-41, -30] at t₁.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y at that turn, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at T.\n\nThat is, for some car on y, 0 ∈ [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] for right-moving car.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, I'll use that.\n\ns is speed, which is 6 for all cars here.\n\nt₁ = 14.\n\nLet Δt = T - t₁, so at time T, for a car with initial span [τ, h] at t₁, the span is [τ + 6Δt, h + 6Δt].\n\nThen 0 is in [τ + 6Δt, h + 6Δt] if τ + 6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + 6Δt.\n\nSince the car is moving right, and we care about x=0.\n\nNow, the player is at (0, y), so we need to avoid being on y when for some car on y, 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\ny from 1 to 8 are freeways with cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars, I assume. The problem says freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be no cars, so safe.\n\nThe player starts at (0,4), which is freeway 4? y=4, but freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=4 is a freeway with cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, safe.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9).\n\nNow, minimal turns H, meaning from turn t₁ to t₁ + H -1, we reach y=9 at turn t₁ + H -1.\n\nLet me define the turns: at turn t₁, player is at y=4.\n\nAfter action a_{t₁}, at turn t₁+1, y changes to y + Δy.\n\nThen at turn t₁+1, position is (0, y_{t₁+1}), and so on.\n\nWe need y_{t₁ + H -1} = 9.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=0 to H-1 relative to t₁, so actions from a_{t₁} to a_{t₁ + H-1}, and after H actions, at turn t₁ + H, position is set, but we reach at turn t₁ + H -1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, before action, position is y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, position is y_t.\n\nWe start at turn t₁, position y_{t₁} =4.\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nT = t₁ + H -1 for some H, meaning after H-1 actions, we reach y=9 at turn t₁ + (H-1).\n\nSet t=0 as turn t₁.\n\nSo at turn 0 (t₁), y=4.\n\nAfter action a_0, at turn 1, y= y_0 + Δy_0.\n\nGenerally, at turn k (which is t₁ + k), y_k = y_0 + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} Δy_i.\n\nWe want y_K =9 for some K, with K minimal, so H = K+1 turns? Let's define.\n\nAt turn t₁, we are at position.\n\nAfter first action a_{t₁}, at turn t₁+1, new position.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t₁ + H.\n\nBut we want the position at some turn to be (0,9).\n\nThe minimal H such that y_{t₁ + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if I do nothing, at turn t₁, I am at 4, not 9.\n\nAfter one action, at turn t₁+1, I could be at 3,4, or5.\n\nTo reach 9, I need to increase y, since 4 to 9, difference 5, so at least 5 up actions if no down, but I might need to stay or down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 5.\n\nBut with cars, I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway y=1 to 8, the cars and when they are at x=0.\n\nFor each freeway, multiple cars, so I need to find for each y, the times when there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nThat is, for some car, τ + 6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + 6Δt for Δt = T - t₁.\n\nSince t₁=14, let u = T - 14, so u is the turn offset from now.\n\nAt time T = 14 + u, for a car, 0 in [τ + 6u, h + 6u] if min(τ +6u, h+6u) ≤ 0 ≤ max(τ +6u, h+6u), but since right-moving, τ < h, so τ +6u ≤ h +6u, so 0 in [τ +6u, h +6u] iff τ +6u ≤ 0 ≤ h +6u.\n\nThen, since u integer, we can solve for u.\n\nτ +6u ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h +6u, so τ +6u ≤ 0 ≤ h +6u.\n\nWhich implies that u must satisfy ceil( ( -h )/6 ) ≤ u ≤ floor( ( -τ )/6 )? Let's derive.\n\nFrom τ +6u ≤ 0, so 6u ≤ -τ, u ≤ floor( -τ /6 )? Since u integer.\n\nSimilarly, from 0 ≤ h +6u, so 6u ≥ -h, u ≥ ceil( -h /6 )\n\nLet me write inequalities:\n\nτ + 6u ≤ 0 ⇒ 6u ≤ -τ ⇒ u ≤ floor( -τ / 6 ) only if -τ/6 not integer, but better to use inequalities.\n\nSince u integer, τ +6u ≤ 0 ⇒ u ≤ floor( -τ / 6 )? Let's think.\n\nFor example, τ +6u ≤ 0, so u ≤ ceil( -τ /6 )? I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me set A = τ +6u ≤ 0 and B: 0 ≤ h +6u.\n\nA: τ +6u ≤ 0 ⇒ u ≤ ceil( -τ /6 )? ceil function.\n\nActually, τ +6u ≤ 0 ⇒ 6u ≤ -τ ⇒ u ≤ floor( -τ /6 ) if -τ/6 integer, else floor, but since u integer, u ≤ floor( ( -τ - epsilon ) for epsilon small, but better to use:\n\nu ≤ floor( -τ / 6 ) because if -τ/6 = k integer, u ≤ k, if -τ/6 = k + f, f>0, u ≤ k = floor.\n\nSimilarly, B: 0 ≤ h +6u ⇒ 6u ≥ -h ⇒ u ≥ ceil( -h /6 )\n\nThen u must satisfy ceil( -h /6 ) ≤ u ≤ floor( -τ /6 )\n\nAnd since τ and h are integers, we can compute.\n\nThen for each car, we can find the u where it occupies x=0.\n\nThen for a freeway, at time u, if any car has u in that range, then the freeway is occupied at that time.\n\nOtherwise, it is safe.\n\nThen the player can be on that freeway only when it is safe.\n\nNow, y=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nWe start at y=4 at u=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some u=K, with K minimal.\n\nActions: each turn, we can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nSince we need to go from 4 to 9, we must increase y by 5, so we need at least 5 up actions. With possible stay or down, H >=5, and K = u when we reach, H = K+1? Let's define u properly.\n\nSet u = 0 at turn t₁=14.\n\nAt u=0, position y=4.\n\nAfter action, at u=1, position y_1, and so on.\n\nAt u=K, position y_K =9.\n\nK is the number of turns after start, so total turns from start to reach is K, but at u=0 we are at turn t₁, position set, action a_{t₁} changes to u=1 position.\n\nThe turn when we are at y=9 is u=K, which is turn t₁ + K.\n\nH is such that t₁ + H -1 = t₁ + K, so H-1 = K, thus H = K+1.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from a_{t₁} to a_{t₁ + H-1}, and at turn t₁ + H-1, position is 9.\n\nSince at turn t, position y_t is before action, but at turn t, we have position, then we do action to go to next.\n\nAt turn t₁ + H-1, we are at position, and if it is 9, we are done.\n\nThe actions are for turns t₁ to t₁ + H-1, and at turn t₁ + H-1, after action? No.\n\nLet's clarify the timeline.\n\n- At the beginning of turn t, player is at position y_t.\n\n- Player chooses action a_t.\n\n- Then, y_{t+1} is set based on a_t.\n\n- Also, cars move to their positions at turn t for collision check? Collision is checked at turn t based on position at turn t.\n\nThe collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and 0 in car span on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSo at turn T, we have y_T and car positions at T.\n\nFor the player, at turn T, position y_T is where they are during that turn.\n\nWhen we move, at turn T, we are on y_T before moving.\n\nIf we move to a new y at turn T, at turn T we are still on old y, and only at turn T+1 we are on new y.\n\nIn terms of collision, at turn T, we are on y_T, and we check cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nIf we are moving to y_{T+1} at turn T, at turn T we are on y_T, so we check cars on y_T at T.\n\nAt turn T+1, we are on y_{T+1}, check cars on y_{T+1} at T+1.\n\nSo for the path, we need that for each turn T, when on y_T between 1 and 8, it is not occupied at that turn.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nNow back to the cars.\n\nFirst, list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: two cars\n\nCar A: (h=36, τ=25, right, s=6) so at u=0, span [25,36]\n\n0 in span when 25 +6u ≤ 0 ≤ 36 +6u? No\n\n[τ +6u, h +6u] = [25+6u, 36+6u]\n\n0 in [25+6u, 36+6u] iff 25+6u ≤ 0 ≤ 36+6u\n\nSince 25+6u ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 36+6u, but 36+6u >0 always for u>=0, since u>=0, 36+6u >=36>0.\n\nSimilarly, 25+6u <=0 only if u <= -25/6 ≈ -4.166, so u <= -5 since u integer? u = T - t1, T >= t1 so u >=0.\n\nFor u>=0, 25+6u >=25>0, so 0 < 25+6u <= 36+6u, so 0 not in [25+6u, 36+6u] because min is 25+6u >0.\n\nSimilarly, upper bound 36+6u >0.\n\nSo for car A, 0 never in span for u>=0.\n\nNow second car on freeway 1: (h=-30, τ=-41, right, s=6)\n\nSpan at u: [τ +6u, h +6u] = [-41 +6u, -30 +6u]\n\n0 in this if -41+6u <= 0 <= -30+6u\n\nSo two inequalities:\n\n-41 +6u <= 0 ⇒ 6u <= 41 ⇒ u <= 41/6 ≈ 6.833, so u <= 6\n\nAnd 0 <= -30 +6u ⇒ 6u >= 30 ⇒ u >= 5\n\nSo u >=5 and u<=6\n\nThus for u=5 and u=6, 0 in span.\n\nAt u=5: [-41+30, -30+30] = [-11,0], 0 is included? -11 <=0<=0, yes 0<=0.\n\nSimilarly u=6: [-41+36, -30+36] = [-5,6], 0 in [-5,6], yes.\n\nFor u<5 or u>6, not.\n\nSo for freeway 1, occupied when u=5 or u=6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same cars? From table:\n\nFreeway 2: (36,25,right,6) and (-30,-41,right,6) same as freeway 1.\n\nSo also occupied u=5,6.\n\nFreeway 3: same, occupied u=5,6.\n\nFreeway 4: same, occupied u=5,6.\n\nNow freeway 5: three cars\n\nFirst: (36,25,right,6) same as before, 0 never in span for u>=0.\n\nSecond: (-42,-53,right,6) h=-42, τ=-53? Head and tail.\n\nSpan: [τ +6u, h +6u] = [-53+6u, -42+6u]\n\n0 in this if -53+6u <=0 <= -42+6u\n\nSo -53+6u <=0 ⇒ 6u <=53 ⇒ u<= floor(53/6)=8.833, u<=8\n\nAnd 0<= -42+6u ⇒ 6u>=42 ⇒ u>=7\n\nSo u>=7 and u<=8\n\nThus u=7,8\n\nThird car: (-6,-17,right,6) h=-6, τ=-17\n\nSpan: [-17+6u, -6+6u]\n\n0 in this if -17+6u <=0 <= -6+6u\n\n-17+6u <=0 ⇒ 6u<=17 ⇒ u<= floor(17/6)=2.833, u<=2\n\n0<= -6+6u ⇒ 6u>=6 ⇒ u>=1\n\nSo u>=1 and u<=2\n\nThus u=1,2\n\nNow for freeway 5, occupied if any car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst car: never\n\nSecond car: u=7,8\n\nThird car: u=1,2\n\nSo occupied at u=1,2 and u=7,8.\n\nFreeway 6: same cars as freeway 5? Table says for 5,6,7,8 all have same: (36,25,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: | (36, 25, right, 6), (-42, -53, right, 6), (-6, -17, right, 6) |\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\nSo freeway 6 same as 5: occupied u=1,2 and u=7,8.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same, occupied u=1,2 and u=7,8.\n\nFreeway 8: same, occupied u=1,2 and u=7,8.\n\nNow freeway 1 to 4: each occupied only at u=5,6.\n\nFreeway 1: we have u=5,6 occupied.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4 same.\n\nFreeway 5 to 8: occupied u=1,2 and u=7,8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at u=0, y=4.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, which at u=0, is it occupied?\n\nFor freeway 4, at u=0, we need to check if occupied.\n\nFreeway 4 has cars: first car (36,25) span [25,36] not contain 0.\n\nSecond car (-30,-41) span [-41,-30] at u=0, min -41, max -30, both negative, so 0 not in [-41,-30], since -30 <0.\n\n-41 <= -30 <= -30 <0, so 0 not in interval.\n\nSimilarly for others, at u=0, for freeway 4, no car has 0 in span, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways at u=0.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=4 to y=9.\n\ny=4 to y=9, we need to go up 5 steps.\n\nBut we have to avoid the occupied times.\n\nSince we can stay or go down, we might delay or something.\n\nBut minimal turns, so we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on occupied freeway at wrong time.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the unsafe times:\n\ny=1: unsafe at u=5,6\n\ny=2: unsafe at u=5,6\n\ny=3: unsafe at u=5,6\n\ny=4: unsafe at u=5,6\n\ny=5: unsafe at u=1,2 and u=7,8\n\ny=6: unsafe at u=1,2 and u=7,8\n\ny=7: unsafe at u=1,2 and u=7,8\n\ny=8: unsafe at u=1,2 and u=7,8\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nWe start at u=0, y=4, which is safe since not occupied at u=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some u=K.\n\nSince we start at y=4, and need to be at y=9, the minimal K is if we go up every turn: at u=0 y=4, after U, u=1 y=5, but y=5 at u=1 is unsafe? y=5 unsafe at u=1 and u=2.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up to y=6 at u=2, also unsafe, etc.\n\nLet's see the path.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at u=K.\n\nTo minimize K, we should go up as much as possible, but avoid unsafe positions.\n\nSince we can stay or go down, we might wait at safe positions.\n\nBut y=0 and y=9 are safe, so we can stay there if needed.\n\ny=4 at u=0 is safe, but at u=5,6 it is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, other positions have unsafe times.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible moves.\n\nFirst, from u=0, y=4, safe.\n\nWe can go up, down, or stay.\n\nBut we need to go to 9, so down or stay might delay.\n\nBut if we go up to y=5 at u=1, but y=5 is unsafe at u=1, so if we are on y=5 at u=1, we collide.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=6 at u=2, unsafe.\n\nBut we can go to other y.\n\nAt u=0, we can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, to y=5 at u=1.\n\nBut y=5 unsafe at u=1, so collision.\n\nIf D, to y=3 at u=1.\n\ny=3 at u=1: is it safe? y=3 unsafe only at u=5,6, so at u=1, should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, S, stay at y=4 at u=1, which at u=1, y=4 safe? y=4 unsafe at u=5,6, not u=1, so yes safe.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nSince going up immediately to y=5 or y=6 at u=1 or 2 is unsafe, we might go down first or stay.\n\nBut going down might take more turns.\n\nLet's think about the unsafe times.\n\nThe unsafe periods: for y=1-4, only unsafe at u=5,6.\n\nFor y=5-8, unsafe at u=1,2 and u=7,8.\n\nu=1 and 2 are early, u=5,6 middle, u=7,8 late.\n\nWe start at u=0, y=4.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, but to be on y=9, we must come from y=8.\n\ny=8 is unsafe at u=1,2 and u=7,8.\n\nSimilarly, y=7,6,5 unsafe at u=1,2 and u=7,8.\n\nNow, at u=0, y=4 safe.\n\nIf we go up to y=5 at u=1, unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we go down to y=3 at u=1.\n\ny=3 at u=1: y=3 unsafe only at u=5,6, so at u=1 safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up or down.\n\nBut we need to go to 9.\n\nIf we stay at y=4 at u=1, safe.\n\nBut then at u=1, y=4 safe.\n\nNow u=2: if we go to y=5 at u=2, y=5 unsafe at u=2, collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at u=2 unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=5,6,7,8 at u=1 or u=2.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y=1,2,3,4 at u=5 or u=6.\n\nBut at u=0,1,2,3,4,7,8,9,... some are safe for some y.\n\nLet's list for each u, which y are safe.\n\nFor u=0: y=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 all safe?

But y=1-4 unsafe only at u=5,6, so at u=7 should be safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\ny=5: at u=7, second car [-53+42,-42+42]=[-11,0], 0 in, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8 unsafe.\n\nu=8: similar, y=5-8 unsafe.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSummary of safe (y,u) positions:\n\n- For u=0: all y safe\n\n- u=1: y=0,1,2,3,4,9 safe; y=5,6,7,8 unsafe\n\n- u=2: y=0,1,2,3,4,9 safe; y=5,6,7,8 unsafe\n\n- u=3: all y safe? y=1-4 safe, y=5-8 safe as above, y=0,9 safe\n\n- u=4: all y safe\n\n- u=5: y=0,5,6,7,8,9 safe; y=1,2,3,4 unsafe\n\n- u=6: y=0,5,6,7,8,9 safe; y=1,2,3,4 unsafe\n\n- u=7: y=0,1,2,3,4,9 safe; y=5,6,7,8 unsafe\n\n- u=8: y=0,1,2,3,4,9 safe; y=5,6,7,8 unsafe\n\n- u=9: all should be safe, since no more unsafe times listed, but let's check.\n\nAt u=9, for y=1: cars at u=9: first [25+54,36+54]=[79,90] no, second [-41+54,-30+54]=[13,24] no, safe.\n\ny=5: first [25+54,36+54]=[79,90] no, second [-53+54,-42+54]=[1,12] no, third [-17+54,-6+54]=[37,48] no, safe.\n\nSimilarly all safe for u>8.\n\nNow, player starts at u=0, y=4.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some u=K.\n\nTo minimize K, we want small K.\n\nPossible to reach by u=5? But at u=5, y=9 is safe, but we need to be there.\n\nFrom start, we need to go from y=4 to y=9 in K turns.\n\nWith actions, each action can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nThe net change must be +5, so we need at least 5 up actions.\n\nMinimal K if no delays: at u=0 y=4, after 5 ups: u=1 y=5, u=2 y=6, u=3 y=7, u=4 y=8, u=5 y=9.\n\nNow, check if all positions safe:\n\nAt u=0, y=4: safe\n\nu=1, y=5: but at u=1, y=5 unsafe, collision. Not possible.\n\nWe cannot go directly up because at u=1 and u=2, y=5-8 are unsafe.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on y=5-8 at u=1 and u=2.\n\nSimilarly, at u=5 and u=6, y=1-4 are unsafe.\n\nSince we start at y=4, at u=0 safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nOne idea: since at u=1 and u=2, y=5-8 unsafe, but y=0-4 safe, so we can stay low for first two turns.\n\nFor example, at u=0, y=4, we can go down or stay or up, but up to y=5 unsafe, so not up.\n\nSo we can go down to y=3 or stay at y=4.\n\nSimilarly at u=1, we can be on y=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nThen at u=3 and u=4, all safe, so we can go up freely.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 by some u.\n\nAlso, at u=5 and u=6, y=1-4 unsafe, so we should not be on low y at that time.\n\nSince we are going up, we might be high by then.\n\nLet's plan the path.\n\nStart: u=0, y=4\n\nTo avoid u=1 and u=2 on high y, we can stay at y=4 or go down.\n\nBut if we stay or go down, we delay going up.\n\nFor example, suppose at u=0, we stay: a_{t1} = S, so at u=1, y=4 (since S, no change).\n\nAt u=1, y=4, which is safe (since y=4 safe at u=1).\n\nThen at u=1, we can choose action: if we go up to y=5, but at u=1, y=5 unsafe, so cannot.\n\nSimilarly, cannot go to y=6,7,8.\n\nWe can stay at y=4, or go down to y=3, or go to y= something safe.\n\nAt u=1, safe y are 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nWe can go down to y=3, or stay, or even to y=2, etc.\n\nBut we need to go up later.\n\nSince at u=3 and u=4 all safe, we can go up during those times.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need 5 up actions.\n\nLet me denote the actions.\n\nSet actions from u=0 to u=K-1, and at u=K, y=9.\n\nAt u=0, y=4.\n\nAfter action a_0, y at u=1.\n\nAfter a_1, y at u=2, and so on, after a_{K-1}, y at u=K is 9.\n\ny at u=K = y_0 + sum_{i=0}^{K-1} Δy_i = 4 + sum_{i=0}^{K-1} Δy_i = 9, so sum Δy_i = 5.\n\nEach Δy_i = +1,0,-1 for U,S,D.\n\nNumber of U minus number of D = 5.\n\nTotal actions K.\n\nMinimal K when no S or D, all U, K=5, but not possible due to unsafe positions.\n\nWe need to add S or D to avoid unsafe spots.\n\nNow, from above, at u=1 and u=2, we cannot be on y=5,6,7,8.\n\nAt u=0, we are at y=4.\n\nIf we do S at u=0, then at u=1, y=4.\n\nIf we do D at u=0, at u=1, y=3.\n\nIf we do U, at u=1, y=5, unsafe, not possible.\n\nSo only possible actions at u=0: S or D.\n\nSimilarly at u=1, if we are at y=4 or lower, we can only go to safe y at u=2.\n\nAt u=2, safe y are 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nThen at u=3, all y safe, so we can start going up.\n\nSimilarly u=4 all safe.\n\nNow, at u=5 and u=6, y=1,2,3,4 unsafe, so we should not be on low y at u=5,6.\n\nSince we are going up, we might be at high y by u=5.\n\nu=5 is turn 5, we start from u=0.\n\nLet's see how fast we can go up.\n\nSuppose we do:\n\nu=0: at y=4, we do S, so stay y=4.\n\nThen at u=1: y=4, we can do? We can do S again, or D to y=3, or U not possible.\n\nIf we do S, at u=2 y=4.\n\nThen at u=2, y=4, we can do action for u=3.\n\nAt u=3, all safe, so we can go up.\n\nSimilarly, we can go down first.\n\nBut going down might take more turns to go up later.\n\nTo minimize K, we should not go down, only stay or up when possible.\n\nSo best to stay at y=4 for u=0 and u=1.\n\nu=0: S, so at u=1 y=4.\n\nThen at u=1: since at u=1 y=4, we need to choose action for u=2 position.\n\nAt u=2, we can be on y=4 (if S), or y=3 (if D), or y=5 not possible.\n\nNow at u=2, y=4 is safe, as above.\n\nThen at u=2, we do action for u=3.\n\nAt u=3, all y safe, so we can do U to go to y=5 at u=3? At u=3, position y at u=3.\n\nAction at u=2 determines y at u=3.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo let's sequence:\n\n- At u=0: S, so y=4 at u=1 (since after action)\n\nAfter action at u=0, y at u=1 is set.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo:\n\nStart u=0: y=4\n\nAction a0: S → y at u=1: 4\n\nAction a1: at u=1, we choose for next.\n\nWe can choose S: so y at u=2: 4\n\nOr D: y at u=2: 3\n\nOr U: y at u=2: 5, but at u=2, y=5 unsafe, not possible.\n\nSo only S or D.\n\nIf we do S at a1, then y at u=2: 4\n\nThen at u=2, action a2: we can choose to go to y at u=3.\n\nAt u=3, all safe, so we can go to y=5 (U), or y=4 (S), or y=3 (D), but we want to go up.\n\nSo better U to y=5 at u=3.\n\nThen at u=3, y=5, which is safe (since u=3, y=5 safe).\n\nThen action a3 at u=3: we can go U to y=6 at u=4.\n\nAt u=4, all safe, y=6 safe.\n\nThen action a4 at u=4: U to y=7 at u=5.\n\nAt u=5, y=7: is it safe? u=5, y=7 safe? From above, u=5, y=5,6,7,8 safe, yes.\n\ny=7 is safe at u=5.\n\nThen action a5 at u=5: U to y=8 at u=6.\n\nAt u=6, y=8: u=6, y=8 safe, yes.\n\nThen action a6 at u=6: U to y=9 at u=7.\n\nAt u=7, y=9, which is the goal, y=9.\n\nBut we need y at u=K to be 9, here at u=7, y=9.\n\nNow, K=7, meaning at turn u=7, we reach y=9.\n\nNow, check the path:\n\nu=0: y=4, action S → u=1 y=4\n\nu=1: y=4, action S → u=2 y=4\n\nu=2: y=4, action U → u=3 y=5\n\nu=3: y=5, action U → u=4 y=6\n\nu=4: y=6, action U → u=5 y=7\n\nu=5: y=7, action U → u=6 y=8\n\nu=6: y=8, action U → u=7 y=9\n\nNow, check for each turn if safe:\n\nAt u=0, y=4: safe\n\nu=1, y=4: safe (as y=4 safe at u=1)\n\nu=2, y=4: safe\n\nu=3, y=5: safe (u=3 all safe)\n\nu=4, y=6: safe\n\nu=5, y=7: safe (u=5, y=7 safe)\n\nu=6, y=8: safe (u=6, y=8 safe)\n\nu=7, y=9: safe\n\nAll safe, and we reached at u=7.\n\nBut is this minimal K?\n\nK=7, meaning after 7 turns from start, at u=7.\n\nu from 0 to 7, that's 8 positions, but turns: at u=0 turn t1, u=1 turn t1+1, ..., u=7 turn t1+7.\n\nWe reach at u=7, turn t1+7.\n\nH such that t1 + H -1 = t1 +7, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nThe sequence has actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, here H=8, actions from a14 to a21? t1=14.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nWe might do better.\n\nFor example, at u=0, instead of staying, we could go down to y=3, but that might take longer.\n\nAt u=0: D, so to y=3 at u=1.\n\nThen at u=1: y=3, safe.\n\nThen we can go to y=4 at u=2? Action at u=1: if U, to y=4 at u=2.\n\nAt u=2, y=4 safe.\n\nThen same as before, at u=2 y=4, then U to y=5 at u=3, etc., same as above but we started lower, so might take same or more turns.\n\nFor example: u=0: D → u=1 y=3\n\nu=1: U → u=2 y=4\n\nu=2: S or U? If U to y=5 at u=3, then u=3 y=5, U to u=4 y=6, U to u=5 y=7, U to u=6 y=8, U to u=7 y=9. Same as before, but we have one extra down and up, so net same, but we used D and U instead of S, but y same at u=2.\n\nIn this case, at u=1 y=3, then to u=2 y=4, then to u=3 y=5, etc., reach u=7 y=9, same K=7.\n\nIf at u=1 we do S, to y=3 at u=2, then need to go up later, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nCan we reach earlier than u=7?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=9 at u=5 or u=6.\n\nu=5: y=9 possible? But to reach y=9 at u=5, we need to increase by 5 in 5 turns from u=0 to u=5.\n\nBut from u=0 to u=1, we cannot go up because y=5 at u=1 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, u=1 to u=2, cannot go to y=5 or above.\n\nSo at u=2, we are at y<=4, since we start y=4, and at u=1 we are <=4, u=2 <=4.\n\nThen from u=2 to u=3, we can go to y=5 at u=3.\n\nThen from u=3 to u=4, to y=6.\n\nu=4 to u=5, to y=7.\n\nThen at u=5, y=7, we can go to y=8 at u=6, or to y=9? But from y=7 to y=8 at u=6, then to y=9 at u=7.\n\nWe cannot reach y=9 before u=7 because:\n\nAt u=3, earliest we can be at high y is y=5, since at u=2 we are at y<=4, and we go to y=5 at u=3.\n\nThen u=3: y=5\n\nu=4: y=6 (if U)\n\nu=5: y=7 (U)\n\nu=6: y=8 (U)\n\nu=7: y=9 (U)\n\nIf we go faster, but at u=3 we can go to y=6? How? From u=2, y<=4, to u=3, y <= y_{u=2} +1 <=5.\n\nSimilarly, cannot jump.\n\nSo minimal to reach y=9 is u=7, as above.\n\nBut at u=5, we are at y=7, but we need to go to y=9, still two more steps.\n\nUnless we are higher earlier, but we cannot.\n\nAnother idea: at u=0, go down to y=3, then at u=1 go down to y=2, but that is worse.\n\nOr, since at u=3 and u=4 all safe, we can go up multiple, but we can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nSo the path I have seems minimal.\n\nBut in the path, at u=2 we are at y=4, then u=3 y=5, u=4 y=6, u=5 y=7, u=6 y=8, u=7 y=9.\n\nWe could at u=4 go to y=7? No, only +1 per action.\n\ny at u=5 is at most y_{u=4} +1.\n\nBut y_{u=4} <= y_{u=3} +1 <= y_{u=2} +1 +1 <= 4 + 2? y_{u=2} <=4, y_{u=3} <=5, y_{u=4} <=6, y_{u=5} <=7, etc.\n\nSo y=9 at u=7 is earliest possible.\n\nWe could reach at u=6? If y=9 at u=6.\n\nBut from above, y_{u=6} <= y_{u=5} +1 <=8, since y_{u=5} <=7, so y_{u=6} <=8, cannot be 9 at u=6.\n\ny_{u=5} max: at u=2, y<=4, u=3 y<=5, u=4 y<=6, u=5 y<=7, so at u=5 y<=7, then u=6 y<=8, so y=9 only possible at u=7 or later.\n\nThus K=7 is minimal.\n\nIn the sequence, we have two stays at the beginning.\n\nWe could have different actions.\n\nFor example, at u=0, we do D to y=3 at u=1.\n\nThen at u=1, y=3, we do U to y=4 at u=2.\n\nThen at u=2, y=4, we do U to y=5 at u=3.\n\nThen same as before: u=3 y=5, U to u=4 y=6, U to u=5 y=7, U to u=6 y=8, U to u=7 y=9.\n\nBut now we have one D and one U extra, net same, but actions: D and U instead of S, but position same at u=2.\n\nNo gain.\n\nAt u=1, if we do S to y=3 at u=2, worse.\n\nSo the first sequence with two S is fine.\n\nIn the sequence, at u=0 and u=1 we did S, but at u=0, we are at y=4, action S, so stay at y=4 for u=1.\n\nThen at u=1, we are at y=4, and we do S again, to stay at y=4 for u=2.\n\nThen at u=2, we do U to y=5 at u=3.\n\nBut at u=2, we could do U directly if possible, but we cannot because y=5 at u=2 unsafe.\n\nIn this case, we have to wait until u=3 to go to y=5.\n\nAnother point: at u=5 and u=6, low y are unsafe, but in our path, we are at high y, so no problem.\n\nWe could go to y=9 earlier if we go to y=0 or something, but y=0 is safe, but it's lower, so takes more turns to go up.\n\nFor example, go to y=0 at u=1, then need to go up 9 steps, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, minimal K=7, reach at u=7.\n\nNow H: since at turn t1 + u, we reach at u=7, so t1 +7.\n\nH such that t1 + H -1 = t1 +7, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nSequence of actions: from a_{t1} to a_{t1+7}, 8 actions.\n\nIn terms of turns:\n\nTurn t1: action for position at t1+1.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt turn t1=14, we perform action a_{14}, which determines y at turn 15.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the path:\n\nAt turn 14 (u=0), position y=4, we do S, so stay, y at turn 15 is 4.\n\nTurn 15 (u=1), position y=4, we do S, so y at turn 16 is 4.\n\nTurn 16 (u=2), position y=4, we do U, so y at turn 17 is 5.\n\nTurn 17 (u=3), position y=5, we do U, so y at turn 18 is 6.\n\nTurn18 (u=4), position y=6, we do U, so y at turn 19 is 7.\n\nTurn19 (u=5), position y=7, we do U, so y at turn 20 is 8.\n\nTurn20 (u=6), position y=8, we do U, so y at turn 21 is 9.\n\nAt turn 21, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nt1 + H -1 = 14 + H -1 = 21, so 13 + H =21, H=8.\n\nActions: from turn 14 to turn 21? Turns when actions are taken: turn 14 to turn 20, 7 actions? Let's list.\n\nActions:\n\n- At turn 14: action a_{14} = S, to go to turn 15 position.\n\n- Turn 15: a_{15} = S, to turn 16 position.\n\n- Turn 16: a_{16} = U, to turn 17 position.\n\n- Turn 17: a_{17} = U, to turn 18 position.\n\n- Turn 18: a_{18} = U, to turn 19 position.\n\n- Turn 19: a_{19} = U, to turn 20 position.\n\n- Turn 20: a_{20} = U, to turn 21 position.\n\nAt turn 21, position is y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, here t1=14, H=8, so a_{14} to a_{21}? a_{t1 + H -1} = a_{14+7} = a_{21}.\n\nBut at turn 21, we perform action to go to turn 22, but we are already at turn 21 position y=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, the last action is for the turn when we reach.\n\nIn the answer format, it says: sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and at turn t1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nIn this case, actions: a_{14} (t=0), a_{15} (t=1), ..., up to a_{20} (t=6), and at turn t1 + H -1 = 14 + H -1.\n\nAfter a_{20}, at turn 21, position is y=9, so turn t1 + H -1 = 21.\n\nThus 14 + H -1 = 21, so 13 + H =21, H=8.\n\nAnd actions from a_{14} to a_{21}? t from 0 to H-1=7.\n\na_{t1 + t} for t=0 to 7: a_{14}, a_{15}, a_{16}, a_{17}, a_{18}, a_{19}, a_{20}, a_{21}.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we have actions up to a_{20}, which sets position at turn 21.\n\nIf we include a_{21}, that would be for position at turn 22.\n\nI think I have confusion.\n\nClarify:\n\n- At turn T, we perform action a_T, which sets y_{T+1}.\n\n- Position at turn T is y_T, determined by previous actions.\n\n- We want y_T =9 for T = t1 + H -1.\n\n- Actions are a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, which set y_{t1+1} to y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut y_{t1 + H} is set by a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9? Inconsistency.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nSo at turn t1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nNow, position at turn t1 + H -1 is y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nThis is set by the actions up to a_{t1 + H -2}, because a_{t1 + H -2} sets y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nActions: a_{t1} sets y_{t1+1}, a_{t1+1} sets y_{t1+2}, ..., a_{t1 + H -2} sets y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2}, H-1 actions? But it says {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, which is from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, that would be H actions.\n\nBut the last action a_{t1 + H -1} sets y_{t1 + H}, not y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nThere is a mismatch.\n\nPerhaps the indexing.\n\nIn the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"reach at turn t1 + H -1\".\n\nBut with H actions, from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, this sets y_{t1+1} to y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} to be 9.\n\nSo y_{t1 + H -1} is set by a_{t1 + H -2}.\n\nThus, the actions should be from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2}, and a_{t1 + H -1} is not needed, but the sequence includes a_{t1 + H -1}? Contradiction.\n\nI think there is an error in the problem statement or my understanding.\n\nRead carefully:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1.\"\n\nAnd \"Turn t_1: a_{t1} ...\"\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, ..., up to some turn.\n\nNow, the sequence has H actions: from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nAfter performing these H actions, the position at turn t1 + H should be set, but we want at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nPerhaps the actions are for the turns when we decide to move.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position, we do action a_T to go to next position at T+1.\n\nSo to be at position at turn T, we need the actions before.\n\nSpecifically, to have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, we need to have performed actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2}, which set y_{t1+1} to y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nThe last action that affects y_{t1 + H -1} is a_{t1 + H -2}.\n\nThen the sequence of actions should be from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2}, for H-1 actions.\n\nBut the problem says sequence with t from 0 to H-1, which is H actions, including a_{t1 + H -1}, which sets y_{t1 + H}, not y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nSo to reach at turn t1 + H -1, we don't need a_{t1 + H -1}, only up to a_{t1 + H -2}.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem or my reading.\n\nPerhaps \"turns H\" includes the starting turn.\n\nAnother way: \"minimal number of turns H\" might mean the number of turns from start to end, inclusive.\n\nFor example, from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -1, that is H turns.\n\nAt turn t1, position is given.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, we are at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nWith H-1 actions.\n\nThen the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1 + H -2, H-1 actions.\n\nBut the problem says sequence {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, which has H elements, from t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then t from 0 to 0, one action a_{t1}, which sets y_{t1+1}, but we want y_{t1} =9, which is already set, no action needed. Confusion.\n\nI think for this problem, since we start at turn t1 with position, and we perform actions to reach at a later turn.\n\nIn this case, at turn t1, we are at y=4, not 9, so we need to perform actions.\n\nThe first action is at turn t1.\n\nAfter action at turn t1, we go to turn t1+1 position.\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T=9.\n\nT = t1 + K for some K.\n\nThen H = K+1, meaning from turn t1 to turn t1+K, that's K+1 turns.\n\nActions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + K -1}? Let's stop.\n\nFrom my earlier path, we reach at turn 21, which is t1 +7.\n\nTurn t1=14, turn 21 = 14+7.\n\nSo K=7, number of turns from start to end: from turn 14 to turn 21, that's 8 turns: 14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21.\n\nH=8.\n\nAt turn 14, position y=4.\n\nWe perform actions at turn 14,15,16,17,18,19,20 to set positions at 15 to 21.\n\nAt turn 21, y=9.\n\nThe actions are at turn 14 to 20, 7 actions.\n\nSequence: a14 to a20.\n\nIn the answer, it should be from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2}? Since a_{t1 + H -2} sets y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nBut in the format, it says {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for H=8, t from 0 to 7, a14 to a21.\n\nBut a21 is not used, since it sets y22.\n\nI think for the sequence, when we reach at turn T, the last action is at turn T-1.\n\nSo for T=21, last action at turn 20.\n\nActions at turn 14 to 20.\n\nNumber of actions: 7.\n\nH should be the number of turns from start to end, which is 8 turns.\n\nSequence has H-1 actions.\n\nBut the problem says sequence with H actions for t=0 to H-1.\n\nPerhaps in the action sequence, it includes the action for the turn when we start, but since we are already at position, the action changes it.\n\nTo resolve, let's look at the answer format: \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\" etc., up to the turn where we perform the last action.\n\nIn my case, actions at turn 14,15,16,17,18,19,20.\n\nAnd at turn 21, we are at y=9, no action needed or performed.\n\nSo the sequence should be from turn 14 to turn 20, 7 actions.\n\nH=8, number of turns.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-2? Messy.\n\nPerhaps the problem means H as the number of actions.\n\nBut it says \"minimal number of turns H\", and \"reach at turn t1 + H -1\".\n\nIn the context, for H=1, if we were at y=9 at t1, but we are not, so H>1.\n\nIn my path, with 7 actions, we reach at turn 21 = t1 +7.\n\nt1 + H -1 =14 + H -1 =13 + H.\n\nSet 13 + H =21, H=8.\n\nThen sequence {a_{14 + t} for t=0 to 7} : a14, a15, a16, a17, a18, a19, a20, a21.\n\nBut a21 is for turn 21, which sets y22, but we don't need it, since we reach at turn 21.\n\nSo a21 should not be included.\n\nI think there is a inconsistency.\n\nPerhaps for the turn when we reach, we don't perform action, so the last action is at turn t1 + H -2.\n\nThen for H=8, last action at 14+6=20.\n\nSequence t=0 to 6 for H-1=7 actions.\n\nBut the problem says t=0 to H-1, which for H=8 is t=0 to7, 8 actions.\n\nI think I should proceed with the sequence I have.\n\nIn the answer, I will list the actions from turn 14 to turn 20.\n\nH=8.\n\nNow for the cars, in freeway 5 to 8, there is a car at u=1 and u=2 for the third car, but in our path, we avoided being on y=5-8 at u=1,2.\n\nSimilarly, at u=5,6 we are on high y, safe.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 4, at u=5,6 it is unsafe, but we are not there.\n\nIn the sequence, at u=0,1,2 we are on y=4, which is safe at those times.\n\nu=0,1,2 y=4 safe.\n\nThen we move up.\n\nIn the action sequence, we have two S at the beginning.\n\nBut we could have only one S.\n\nFor example, at u=0, do S, to y=4 at u=1.\n\nThen at u=1, instead of S, we could do D to y=3 at u=2.\n\nThen at u=2, y=3, we do U to y=4 at u=3? Action at u=2: U, to y=5? y at u=3.\n\nAt u=2, y=3, do U, to y=4 at u=3? Δy, if U, y_{t+1} = y_t +1.\n\nAt turn u=2, position y=3, do U, so y at u=3 is 4.\n\nThen at u=3, y=4, we can do U to y=5 at u=4.\n\nThen u=4 y=5, U to u=5 y=6, U to u=6 y=7, U to u=7 y=8, U to u=8 y=9.\n\nThen we reach at u=8, later, K=8, worse.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt u=2, y=3, do U to y=4 at u=3, then U to y=5 at u=4, etc., reach at u=7 y=8, u=8 y=9.\n\nK=8>7.\n\nSo worse.\n\nThus the first sequence with two S is better.\n\nAt u=1, we could go to y=2 or something, but not helpful.\n\nSo I think the sequence is fine.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nt1=14.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nAnd at turn 21, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=8, actions from t=0 to 7: a14 to a21, but a21 not needed.\n\nPerhaps in the answer, we list up to the action before the reaching turn.\n\nI think for the box, I'll write the actions as per the path.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nBut this is 7 actions, and we reach at turn 21.\n\nt1 + H -1 =14 + H -1=21, so H=8.\n\nThe sequence should have H actions, so perhaps include a21, but what? Since we are at y=9, we can do S or something, but it's not necessary.\n\nThe problem says \"a sequence of actions to reach\", and after reaching, no need to act, but the sequence might include extra.\n\nTo minimize, we should not have extra actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it might be fine.\n\nI think I should go with this.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at u=6? But earlier we saw not possible.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=9 directly, but cannot.\n\nOr, since at u=3, we can be at y=5, but if we go to y=4 at u=2, then to y=5 at u=3, same.\n\nAt u=0, go down to y=3 at u=1, then at u=1 go down to y=2 at u=2, then at u=2 go to y=3 or something, but then at u=3 y=3, need to go to y=9, takes more ups.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo minimal is K=7, H=8.\n\nNow for the car state, in freeway 5 to 8, there is a car at u=7,8, but in our path, at u=7 we are at y=9, safe, not on freeway.\n\nAt u=7, if we were on y=8, it would be unsafe, but we are at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, at u=6 we are at y=8, but u=6, for y=8, is it safe? u=6, y=8 safe, as per earlier.\n\ny=8 unsafe at u=7 and u=8, but at u=6, it is safe.\n\nThen at u=6, we do U to y=9 at u=7, safe.\n\nNo problem.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo I think this is the plan.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 14\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 8.

The actions are chosen to stay at safe positions:\n- At turns 14 and 15, staying at \\(y = 4\\) avoids the unsafe freeways 5-8 at \\(u = 1\\) and \\(u = 2\\).\n- From turn 16 to turn 20, moving up (U) each turn reaches \\(y = 9\\) by turn 21, avoiding the unsafe low freeways (1-4) at \\(u = 5\\) and \\(u = 6\\) and the unsafe high freeways (5-8) at \\(u = 7\\) and \\(u = 8\\).\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n- Turn 14: Stay (S), resulting in position (0, 4) at turn 15.\n- Turn 15: Stay (S), resulting in position (0, 4) at turn 16.\n- Turn 16: Up (U), resulting in position (0, 5) at turn 17.\n- Turn 17: Up (U), resulting in position (0, 6) at turn 18.\n- Turn 18: Up (U), resulting in position (0, 7) at turn 19.\n- Turn 19: Up (U), resulting in position (0, 8) at turn 20.\n- Turn 20: Up (U), resulting in position (0, 9) at turn 21.\n\nAt turn 21, the position is (0, 9), which is safe as \\(y = 9\\) has no cars. All intermediate positions are safe:\n- Turns 14, 15, 16: \\(y = 4\\) is safe at \\(u = 0, 1, 2\\).\n- Turn 17: \\(y = 5\\) is safe at \\(u = 3\\).\n- Turn 18: \\(y = 6\\) is safe at \\(u = 4\\).\n- Turn 19: \\(y = 7\\) is safe at \\(u = 5\\).\n- Turn 20: \\(y = 8\\) is safe at \\(u = 6\\).\n\nThis path achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 8\\) turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1=15, and I start at y=4.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. All cars are moving right with speed 6, meaning they increase their position by 6 per turn. Since they're moving right, the span is [τ, h] initially, and at time T, it becomes [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)].\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is within the span of some car. Importantly, when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn, so I only check the car on my current row at the current turn.\n\nI need to go from y=4 to y=9. Since y=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway (freeways are y=1 to 8), I don't have to worry about cars there. But to reach it, I need to be at y=8 and then move up, or something. Let me think about the actions.\n\nI can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). Each action changes y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nI start at y=4, and I need to get to y=9. The minimum number of moves without any obstacles would be 5 up moves, so H=5, but I have to avoid cars, so it might take longer if I have to wait or go around.\n\nBut in this case, since I can only move vertically, and cars are moving horizontally, I just need to time my moves so that when I'm on a row, no car is covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe player is always at x=0, I assume, since it's (0, y_t), so we're fixed at x=0, moving only vertically.\n\nCars are on the freeways, moving horizontally, so collision happens if at turn T, y_T is between 1 and 8, and x=0 is covered by a car on that row at that turn.\n\nNow, let's list the cars for each row. From the table:\n\nFor freeway 1: two cars: (42,31,right,6) and (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nBut direction right, so for right-moving cars, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I think, because it says for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the car update, for left-moving it was [h, τ] with h decreasing, but here all are right-moving.\n\nIn the state, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], which might imply τ < h since it's from tail to head.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, it was [h, τ] with h > τ, I think.\n\nBut in this case, all cars are right-moving.\n\nSo for each car, at time t1=15, we have the span.\n\nBut let's clarify the notation. For a car, it has head and tail. For right-moving, head is the front, so when moving right, head has higher x, tail has lower x, so span is [tail, head].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, head has lower x, tail has higher x, span [head, tail].\n\nBut here all are right-moving, so for each car, span [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nNow in the table, for row 1: (42,31,right,6) but 42 and 31, if τ=31, h=42, that would be [31,42], but since it's moving right, and x increasing, if τ=31, h=42, that means tail at 31, head at 42, so it occupies x from 31 to 42.\n\nBut at x=0, which is far left, this car is at high x, so probably not near 0.\n\nSimilarly, another car: (-24,-35,right,6). If τ=-35, h=-24, then span [-35,-24], which is also left of 0, since negative.\n\nBut since they're moving right, at future times, they might cover x=0.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nFirst, let's define the position at time T relative to t1.\n\nSet ΔT = T - t1, so at time T = t1 + ΔT.\n\nFor a car on a freeway, its span at time T is [τ + s * ΔT, h + s * ΔT] for right-moving cars, since s is speed.\n\ns=6 for all, from the table.\n\nNow, collision if for some car on row y, at turn T, 0 is in [τ + 6ΔT, h + 6ΔT].\n\nSince the span is a closed interval, I assume.\n\nNow, 0 in [low, high] means low <= 0 <= high.\n\nFor each row and each car, we can find when it covers x=0.\n\nBut multiple cars per row, so for each row, we need to know if any car covers x=0 at a given time.\n\nSince cars can overlap, but we just care if covered.\n\nNow, for row k, y=k, we have a list of cars.\n\nLet me list for each freeway the cars:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars\n\nCar A: τ=31, h=42, s=6, right\n\nCar B: τ=-35, h=-24, s=6, right\n\nAt time T, span A: [31 + 6ΔT, 42 + 6ΔT]\n\nSpan B: [-35 + 6ΔT, -24 + 6ΔT]\n\n0 covered by A if 31 + 6ΔT <= 0 <= 42 + 6ΔT\n\nBut 31 + 6ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= 42 + 6ΔT\n\nSince 31 + 6ΔT <= 0 implies ΔT <= -31/6 ≈ -5.166, but ΔT >=0, since T>=t1, so impossible. Similarly, 0 <= 42 + 6ΔT is always true for ΔT>=0, but the lower bound 31+6ΔT >0 for ΔT>=0, so 0 < lower bound, so 0 not in [31+6ΔT, 42+6ΔT] for any ΔT>=0. So car A never covers x=0.\n\nCar B: [-35+6ΔT, -24+6ΔT]\n\n0 in this if -35+6ΔT <= 0 <= -24+6ΔT\n\nSo -35+6ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= -24+6ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -35+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -24+6ΔT => 6ΔT >=24 => ΔT >=4\n\nSo for ΔT from 4 to 5.833, but since ΔT integer, turn-based, ΔT=4,5\n\nΔT=4: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0? Let's compute:\n\nΔT=4: low = -35 + 6*4 = -35+24= -11\n\nHigh = -24 + 24 = 0\n\nSo span [-11, 0], so 0 is included, since high=0.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=5: low=-35+30= -5, high=-24+30=6, so [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nΔT=6: low=-35+36=1, high=-24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not included.\n\nSo for car B, covers x=0 at ΔT=4 and ΔT=5.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 1, since car A never covers, car B covers at ΔT=4,5.\n\nNow, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? Look at table.\n\nFreeway 2: (42,31,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6) — same as row 1.\n\nIn table, it says for each row, but row 1 and 2 have the same cars?\n\nLook:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\n| 1 | (42,31,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6) |\n\n| 2 | (42,31,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6) | — identical to row 1\n\n| 3 | same |\n\n| 4 | same |\n\n| 5 | (42,31,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6), (0,-11,right,6) |\n\n| 6 | same as 5? (42,31,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6), (0,-11,right,6)\n\n| 7 | same\n\n| 8 | same\n\nFor rows 1 to 4, identical: two cars, one that never covers 0, and one that covers at ΔT=4,5.\n\nFor rows 5 to 8, three cars.\n\nFirst, rows 1-4: as above, car B covers x=0 at ΔT=4 and 5.\n\nNow rows 5-8: cars listed as (42,31,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6), (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: same as before, τ=31,h=42,s=6, right, never covers 0, as before.\n\nSecond car: τ=-47,h=-36,s=6,right\n\nSpan at T: [-47 +6ΔT, -36 +6ΔT]\n\n0 covered if -47+6ΔT <=0 <= -36+6ΔT\n\nSo -47+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT<=47 => ΔT <= 47/6 ≈7.833\n\n0 <= -36+6ΔT => 6ΔT >=36 => ΔT >=6\n\nSo for ΔT=6,7\n\nΔT=6: low=-47+36= -11, high=-36+36=0, span [-11,0], includes 0\n\nΔT=7: low=-47+42= -5, high=-36+42=6, [-5,6], includes 0\n\nΔT=8: low=-47+48=1, high=-36+48=12, [1,12], not include 0\n\nThird car: (0,-11,right,6) — head h=0, tail τ=-11? But for right-moving, span should be [τ,h] with τ < h, but here h=0, τ=-11, so τ=-11, h=0, so span [-11,0] at t1.\n\nAt t1, ΔT=0, span [-11,0], so immediately covers x=0 at t1.\n\nBut t1 is current turn, and we are at turn t1, but we are on y=4, not on this row yet.\n\nAt time T, span is [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-11 +6ΔT, 0 +6ΔT]\n\n0 covered if -11+6ΔT <=0 <= 0+6ΔT\n\nLeft: -11+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=11 => ΔT <= 11/6 ≈1.833\n\nRight: 0 <= 6ΔT always true for ΔT>=0\n\nSo for ΔT=0,1\n\nΔT=0: span [-11,0], includes 0\n\nΔT=1: low=-11+6= -5, high=0+6=6, [-5,6], includes 0\n\nΔT=2: low=-11+12=1, high=0+12=12, [1,12], not include 0\n\nSo for this car, covers at ΔT=0 and 1.\n\nNow for rows 5-8:\n\n- Car 1: never covers 0\n\n- Car 2: covers at ΔT=6,7\n\n- Car 3: covers at ΔT=0,1\n\nSo for freeway 5, for example, x=0 is covered if any car covers, so at ΔT=0,1 (from car 3), and ΔT=6,7 (from car 2)\n\nSimilarly for ΔT=0,1,6,7.\n\nΔT=0 is current time, but we are not on row 5 yet.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=4 to y=9.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=4 is freeway 4.\n\nAt current turn t1=15, I am at (0,4), on freeway 4.\n\nNow, for freeway 4, which is row 4, same as row 1-4, so cars: car B covers at ΔT=4,5, so at T=t1+4=19 and T=t1+5=20, x=0 is covered on row 4.\n\nBut at current turn, ΔT=0, is it covered?\n\nFor row 4, cars: (42,31,right,6) never covers, and (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nAt ΔT=0: span [-35,-24], which is [-35,-24], 0 not in this, since -24 <0? -24 is less than 0, so [-35,-24], all negative, 0 not in, so at ΔT=0, not covered.\n\nCovers only at ΔT=4,5 as above.\n\nSimilarly for other times.\n\nSo for row 4, safe at ΔT=0, and except ΔT=4,5.\n\nNow, I start at y=4 at time t1=15.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9), which is not a freeway, so no cars, but to be there, I need to have y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=9 is not a freeway, I can be there safely.\n\nBut to reach it, I need to move up from y=8 or something.\n\nThe player position: at turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nIf I move up at turn T, y_{T+1} = y_T +1, so at turn T, I am on y_T, and after action, at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn based on where I am at that turn.\n\nSo for turn T, if y_T between 1 and 8, and on that freeway, x=0 covered by some car, then collision.\n\nIf y_T=0 or 9, no freeway, so no collision.\n\nNow, I start at t1=15, y=4.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to get to y=9 asap.\n\nMinimum steps: from y=4 to y=9, I need at least 5 up moves, but I might need to stay or move down if I have to avoid cars, but moving down might not help since I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince I have to go up, and rows above might have different car patterns.\n\nLet me list for each freeway row, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., x=0 covered.\n\nFirst, row 1 (y=1): cars as above, unsafe at ΔT=4 and 5 (from car B)\n\nSimilarly row 2: same, unsafe ΔT=4,5\n\nRow 3: same, unsafe ΔT=4,5\n\nRow 4: same, unsafe ΔT=4,5\n\nNow row 5: cars: unsafe when car 3 covers or car 2 covers.\n\nCar 3: covers ΔT=0,1\n\nCar 2: covers ΔT=6,7\n\nCar 1 never.\n\nSo unsafe at ΔT=0,1,6,7\n\nSimilarly row 6: same, unsafe ΔT=0,1,6,7\n\nRow 7: same, unsafe ΔT=0,1,6,7\n\nRow 8: same, unsafe ΔT=0,1,6,7\n\nNow, ΔT is relative to t1=15, so T = t1 + ΔT = 15 + ΔT\n\nI am at y=4 at T=15.\n\nAt T=15, ΔT=0.\n\nFor row 4, at ΔT=0, is it safe? As above, not covered, so safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is above, so I should move up.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nI can only change y by at most 1 per turn, so I have to pass through y=5,6,7,8 to reach 9.\n\nNow, for each row, I need to be there when it is safe.\n\nI start at y=4 at T=15.\n\nAt T=15, y=4, row 4 safe? Yes, at ΔT=0.\n\nNow, I can choose action at T=15: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go up, at T=16, I will be at y=5.\n\nIf I stay, at T=16 still y=4.\n\nIf down, y=3, but that might not help.\n\nSince I need to go up, I should go up when possible.\n\nNow, at T=15, I can go up to y=5 at T=16.\n\nNow, at T=16, if I am at y=5, which is row 5.\n\nRow 5 at ΔT=1? T=16, ΔT= T - t1 =16-15=1.\n\nFor row 5, unsafe at ΔT=0,1,6,7.\n\nΔT=1 is unsafe, because car 3 covers at ΔT=0,1.\n\nAt ΔT=1, span for car 3: [-11+6*1, 0+6*1] = [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo at T=16, ΔT=1, row 5 is unsafe.\n\nTherefore, if I am at y=5 at T=16, I will collide.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on row 5 at T=16.\n\nThat means, at turn T=15, I should not move up to y=5 at T=16, because at T=16, y=5 is unsafe.\n\nWhat if I stay at y=4 at T=16?\n\nAt T=16, if I am at y=4, row 4.\n\nRow 4 at ΔT=1: T=16, ΔT=1.\n\nRow 4 unsafe only at ΔT=4,5, so at ΔT=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly, I could move down, but to y=3, which might be safe or not.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince row 5 is unsafe at T=16, I should avoid being on row 5 at that time.\n\nI can be on row 5 at other times when it is safe.\n\nFor row 5, safe when not ΔT=0,1,6,7, so for ΔT=2,3,4,5,8,9,... etc.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nI need to plan the sequence of y positions over time.\n\nLet t be the turn, starting from t=15.\n\nAt t=15, y=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe turn when I first reach y=9, I can stop, but I need to be at (0,9), so once I am at y=9, I can stay or whatever, but since no cars, it's fine, but I need to minimize H, the number of turns to reach, so I should reach as soon as possible.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=15, after H-1 actions, I am at y=9 at turn t1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t= t1 to t1 + H -1, with actions at each turn, and position at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, after action a_t, I move to y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t.\n\nI start at turn t1=15, y=4.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, at turn t1 + (H-1), I should be at y=9.\n\nFor example, if I do nothing, at turn 15, y=4, not 9.\n\nAfter first action at t=15, at t=16, y could be 3,4,5.\n\nI need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1=15, so at turn 15 + H -1, y=9.\n\nSet T_end = t1 + H -1, y_{T_end} =9.\n\nH is the number of turns from start, including the starting turn? Let's see the definition.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, meaning actions at time t1 + t for t=0,1,2,...,H-1.\n\nAfter action at time t1 + t, for t from 0 to H-1, the position changes.\n\nAt time t1 + t, before action, position is y_{t1 + t}, then after action a_{t1 + t}, position becomes y_{t1 + t +1}.\n\nBut the position at turn t is given as y_t.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, position is y_t, then I take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn t based on y_t.\n\nAt turn t, if y_t between 1 and 8, and on that row, x=0 covered, collision.\n\nNow, I start at turn t1=15, y=4.\n\nI take actions a_{15}, a_{16}, ..., up to a_{15 + H -2}, and at turn t=15 + H -1, I am at y=9.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, I am at turn t1 + (H-1), at y=9.\n\nFor example, if I could go directly, at t=15, I am at y=4, after action U, at t=16, y=5, after another U, t=17, y=6, and so on, to t=19, y=8, then U to y=9 at t=20.\n\nBut with obstacles.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nI am at t=15, y=4, row 4 is safe at t=15 (ΔT=0).\n\nIf I move up at t=15, I go to y=5 at t=16.\n\nBut at t=16, y=5, row 5 is unsafe because ΔT=1.\n\nSo collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot move up at t=15.\n\nI could stay at y=4 at t=16.\n\nAt t=15, action S, so y_{16} = y_{15} +0 =4.\n\nAt t=16, y=4, row 4.\n\nRow 4 at t=16, ΔT=1, which is safe for row 4, since unsafe only at ΔT=4,5.\n\nNow at t=16, I can take action.\n\nIf I move up to y=5 at t=17.\n\nt=17, ΔT= t-15=2.\n\nAt t=17, if I am at y=5, row 5.\n\nRow 5 at ΔT=2.\n\nFor row 5, unsafe at ΔT=0,1,6,7.\n\nΔT=2 is not in that, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 5 safe at ΔT=2,3,4,5,8,...\n\nΔT=2: safe.\n\nSo at t=17, y=5 is safe.\n\nThen I can be there.\n\nFrom t=16, y=4, I can move up to y=5 at t=17.\n\nAt t=16, I am at y=4, I take action U, so y_{17} = y_{16} +1? No.\n\nAt turn t=16, position y_{16}=4, I take action a_{16}.\n\nIf a_{16} = U, then y_{17} = y_{16} +1 =5.\n\nSo at turn t=17, I am at y=5.\n\nSimilarly, if a_{16}=S, y_{17}=4, etc.\n\nSo back: at t=15, I did S, so at t=16, y=4.\n\nThen at t=16, I can do U, so at t=17, y=5.\n\nNow at t=17, y=5, safe as above.\n\nNow I need to go to y=6.\n\ny=6 is row 6.\n\nAt t=17, ΔT=2.\n\nRow 6: same as row 5, unsafe at ΔT=0,1,6,7.\n\nΔT=2 safe.\n\nSo if I move up at t=17, to y=6 at t=18.\n\nt=18, ΔT=3.\n\ny=6 at t=18, row 6 at ΔT=3, safe.\n\nSimilarly, to y=7 at t=19.\n\nt=19, ΔT=4, y=7, row 7.\n\nRow 7 unsafe at ΔT=0,1,6,7.\n\nΔT=4 not in, so safe? ΔT=4 is not 0,1,6,7, so safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=20.\n\nt=20, ΔT=5, y=8, row 8.\n\nRow 8 unsafe at ΔT=0,1,6,7.\n\nΔT=5 not in, so safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=21.\n\nAt t=21, y=9, which is not freeway, safe.\n\nNow, what about the actions.\n\nStart: t=15, y=4\n\nAction at t=15: S (stay), so y_{16} =4\n\nt=16, y=4, action U, so y_{17} =5\n\nt=17, y=5, action U, so y_{18} =6\n\nt=18, y=6, action U, so y_{19} =7\n\nt=19, y=7, action U, so y_{20} =8\n\nt=20, y=8, action U, so y_{21} =9\n\nAt t=21, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, number of turns: from t=15 to t=21, that's 7 turns? Turns: t=15,16,17,18,19,20,21, that's 7 turns.\n\nBut H is the number of turns to reach, including start or what?\n\nAt turn t=15, position y=4.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=15, not at 9.\n\nAfter 1 action, at t=16, y could be 3,4,5.\n\n...\n\nAfter 6 actions: actions at t=15 to t=20, 6 actions, at turn t=21, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=15 to t=20, that's 6 actions.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so t=0: t1 +0 =15, t=1: t1+1=16, ..., up to t=H-1: t1 + H-1.\n\nAfter actions from t=0 to H-1, at turn t1 + H, position? No.\n\nAt time t, before action, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, position becomes y_{t+1}.\n\nSo after sequence of actions from t=t1 to t=t1 + H -1, we have positions from y_{t1} to y_{t1 + H}.\n\nThe position at turn t1 + H is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9? But the reach is at turn when we are at (0,9), so at some turn T, y_T=9.\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions? Let's see the minimal H such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\".\n\nFrom the problem: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\n\"such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAnd actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nFor t=0, a_{t1 +0} = a_{t1}, action at time t1\n\nAfter a_{t1}, position at t1+1, and so on, up to after a_{t1 + H -2}, position at t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter action a_{t}, position at t+1.\n\nSo after action a_{t1 + k} for k=0 to H-2, position at t1 + H -1? Let's index.\n\nSet actions: a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nThere are H actions.\n\nAfter a_{t1}, position at t1+1\n\nAfter a_{t1+1}, position at t1+2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t1 + H -1}, position at t1 + H\n\nBut we want position at some turn to be 9.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9\n\nThat means at turn t1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nNow, with H actions: actions at t=t1 to t=t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, we have y_{t1+1}, but y_{t1 + H -1} is the position at turn t1 + H -1, which is before the last action or something.\n\nFor example, with no actions, at t1, y=4, not 9.\n\nWith one action, at t1+1, y could be 3,4,5.\n\nTo have y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn my earlier plan, I have at t=21, y=9.\n\nt1=15, so t1 + H -1 =21, so 15 + H -1 =21, thus 14 + H =21, H=7.\n\nActions from t=15 to t=15+6=21? t from 0 to H-1, so for H=7, actions at t=15,16,17,18,19,20,21? t=0:15, t=1:16, ..., t=6:21.\n\nBut action at t=21 would affect y_{22}, but we need y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{15+7-1} = y_{21} =9.\n\nAction at t=21 is after position at t=21, I think.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, then action a_t, then y_{t+1}.\n\nSo for turn t, y_t is before action a_t.\n\nThen after a_t, y_{t+1} for next turn.\n\nTo have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, that means at turn t1 + H -1, before action, position is 9.\n\nThen I don't need to take action at that turn, I think, but the sequence includes actions up to that point.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2} to get to y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at turn T, I need actions from t=t1 to T-1 to determine y_T.\n\ny_{t1} is given.\n\nThen y_{t1+1} depends on a_{t1}, y_{t1+2} on a_{t1+1}, ..., y_T on a_{T-1}.\n\nSo to have y_T =9, I need actions from a_{t1} to a_{T-1}, which are T - t1 actions.\n\nThen T = t1 + K, where K is number of actions, then y_{t1 + K} =9.\n\nBut in the notation, we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so t1 + H -1 = t1 + K, so K = H -1.\n\nThus, number of actions is H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, that's H actions, which would bring us to y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so inconsistency.\n\nI think there is a confusion in indexing.\n\nLet me read the problem carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9),\"\n\n\" such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9 \"\n\nAnd \"the sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\"\n\nFor t=0, a_{t1 +0} = a_{t1}, action at time t1\n\nFor t=1, a_{t1+1}, action at time t1+1\n\n...\n\nFor t=H-1, a_{t1 + H -1}, action at time t1 + H -1\n\nNow, after these actions, the position at time t1 + H is y_{t1 + H}, but we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9, which is before the last action or something.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is the position at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nTo achieve that, with actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2}, because a_{t1} determines y_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1 + H -2} determines y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nThen, the action a_{t1 + H -1} is at time t1 + H -1, which affects y_{t1 + H}, but we don't care about y_{t1 + H} since we already at y=9 at t1 + H -1.\n\nIn the sequence, it includes a_{t1 + H -1}, which is not needed for reaching at t1 + H -1.\n\nPerhaps it's a bit messy.\n\nIn the answer format, it lists actions from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -1, but for the position at t1 + H -1 to be 9, we need actions only up to a_{t1 + H -2}.\n\nBut the sequence includes H actions, up to a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nFor example, if I want to be at y=9 at turn T, I take actions at t from t1 to T-1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., T-1.\n\nNumber of actions: T - t1.\n\nThen T = t1 + K, K actions, y_{t1 + K} =9.\n\nBut here, we have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so t1 + H -1 = t1 + K, so K = H -1.\n\nThen the sequence should have H-1 actions, but the problem says for t=0 to H-1, which is H actions.\n\nI think there might be an off-by-one error in the problem statement.\n\nPerhaps \"turns H\" includes the starting turn.\n\nLet me assume that H is the number of turns from start to finish, including both.\n\nFor example, at turn t1, I am at start, not at goal.\n\nAfter first action, at turn t1+1, I might be closer.\n\nTo be at goal at turn T, the number of turns elapsed is T - t1 +1 or something.\n\nLet's think of the turn number.\n\nAt turn t1, position y_t1 = start.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t1, position start.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn t1+1, position new.\n\n...\n\nAfter M actions, at turn t1 + M, position y_{t1 + M}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + M} =9 for some M.\n\nThen the number of actions is M.\n\nThe number of turns H should be such that at turn t1 + H -1, position is 9, so t1 + H -1 = t1 + M, so H-1 = M, so H = M +1.\n\nThen actions are from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + M -1} = a_{t1} to a_{t1 + (H-1) -1} = a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2}, but the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, a_{t1 + t}, which includes a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, which is one extra action.\n\nI think it's confusing.\n\nPerhaps in this context, \"turns H\" means the number of actions taken, so H actions to reach.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and \"reach at turn t1 + H -1\".\n\nTo simplify, let's proceed with the example.\n\nIn my plan, I have to be at y=9 at t=21.\n\nt1=15, so t=21 = t1 +6.\n\nSo y_{t1 +6} =9.\n\nThen M=6 actions to reach from y4 to y9 in 6 steps.\n\nThen H should be such that t1 + H -1 = t1 +6, so H-1=6, H=7.\n\nThen the sequence of actions for t=0 to 6 (H-1=6, t from 0 to 6, 7 actions? t=0 to H-1 inclusive, that's H actions.\n\nFor H=7, t from 0 to 6, actions at t1+0 to t1+6, times 15 to 21.\n\nBut action at t=21 affects y22, but we need y21=9, which is before action at t=21.\n\nSo action at t=21 is not needed.\n\nTherefore, for y_{t1 + H -1} =9, we need actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2}, and the sequence should be for t=0 to H-2, but the problem says t=0 to H-1.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem statement or my understanding.\n\nPerhaps \"turns H\" includes the turn when we reach.\n\nLet's look at the answer format: \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\" up to \"Turn t1 + H -1: a_{t1 + H -1}\"\n\nAnd at turn t1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nBut at turn t1 + H -1, position is 9 before action a_{t1 + H -1}, so after action a_{t1 + H -1}, position changes, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, we list the action at that turn, but it might not affect the reaching.\n\nFor example, in my case, at t=21, y=9, I can list action S or U or D, but since I am already at 9, it doesn't matter, but to minimize H, I should reach as soon as possible, so at t=21, I am at 9, so I don't need to take action, but the sequence includes it.\n\nBut the action at that turn is part of the sequence, but it doesn't prevent reaching at that turn.\n\nIn terms of collision, at turn t=21, y=9, no collision, and action can be anything, but since y=9, if I go U, y=10, but y max 9, so probably y_{22} = min(9, y21 +1) or something, but the position is clamped to [0,9], so if y=9 and U, y next=9, similarly for D to 8, but I don't want to leave.\n\nBut for reaching, at t=21, I am at 9, so I reached, so the action at t=21 can be specified, but it doesn't affect the reaching at that turn.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence, for turns before, actions matter.\n\nIn my plan, I have actions from t=15 to t=20 to get to y=9 at t=21.\n\nSo actions at t=15,16,17,18,19,20.\n\nThat's 6 actions.\n\nThen for y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{15 + H -1} =21, so 15 + H -1 =21, H=7.\n\nThen sequence for t=0 to 6: actions at t1+0=15, t1+1=16, ..., t1+6=21.\n\nBut action at t=21 is after position at t=21 is 9, so I need to specify an action, say S.\n\nThen the sequence includes a_{21}, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, in the plan, at t=21, I can do S.\n\nNow, back to the car avoidance.\n\nIn my plan, I have:\n\nt=15: y=4, safe\n\nAction S, so y16=4\n\nt=16: y=4, row 4, ΔT=1, safe (unsafe only at ΔT=4,5)\n\nAction U, so y17=5\n\nt=17: y=5, row 5, ΔT=2, safe (unsafe at 0,1,6,7, 2 safe)\n\nAction U, so y18=6\n\nt=18: y=6, row 6, ΔT=3, safe\n\nAction U, so y19=7\n\nt=19: y=7, row 7, ΔT=4, safe? Row 7 unsafe at ΔT=0,1,6,7. ΔT=4 not in, so safe.\n\nAction U, so y20=8\n\nt=20: y=8, row 8, ΔT=5, row 8 unsafe at ΔT=0,1,6,7. ΔT=5 not in, so safe.\n\nAction U, so y21=9\n\nt=21: y=9, reached.\n\nNow, at t=21, I need to specify action, say S.\n\nBut is there a problem with row 4 at later times?\n\nIn this path, I didn't stay on row 4 at unsafe times.\n\nAt t=16, I was on row 4 at ΔT=1, safe.\n\nThen moved away.\n\nNow, row 5 at t=17, ΔT=2, safe.\n\nBut row 5 is unsafe at ΔT=6,7, which are t=15+6=21, t=15+7=22.\n\nAt t=21, if I were on row 5, it would be unsafe, but I am at y=9 or y=8, not on row 5.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nBut in this plan, I reached at t=21.\n\nBut can I reach faster?\n\nMinimum possible: from y=4 to y=9, 5 steps up, so at least 5 actions, reaching at t=20 if start from t=15.\n\nt=15, y=4\n\nIf I go up each turn:\n\nt=15: U, y16=5\n\nt=16: U, y17=6\n\nt=17: U, y18=7\n\nt=18: U, y19=8\n\nt=19: U, y20=9\n\nSo at t=20, y=9.\n\nBut at t=16, y=5, row 5, ΔT=1, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nI could delay or something.\n\nSuppose at t=15, I stay: S, y16=4\n\nThen t=16, U, y17=5\n\nBut at t=17, y=5, ΔT=2, safe, as before.\n\nThen t=17, U, y18=6\n\nt=18, U, y19=7\n\nt=19, U, y20=8\n\nt=20, U, y21=9\n\nSame as before, at t=21.\n\nAt t=16, if I go up to y=5 at t=17, but at t=16 I am at y=4.\n\nCan I go up earlier?\n\nAt t=15, if I go down? To y=3, but y=3 is row 3, which is safe at ΔT=0, but then I have to come back, which might take more turns.\n\nFor example, t=15: D, y16=3\n\nt=16: U, y17=4? Or to y=4.\n\nBut y=3 at t=16, row 3 at ΔT=1, safe.\n\nThen to y=4 at t=17, etc., but I start from lower, so it takes more turns to reach y=9.\n\nSimilarly, not efficient.\n\nPerhaps I can stay on some row to avoid bad times.\n\nFor example, on row 4, unsafe at ΔT=4,5, i.e., t=19 and 20.\n\nIn my plan, at t=19, I am on y=7, not on row 4.\n\nSimilarly, row 5 unsafe at ΔT=6,7, t=21,22.\n\nAt t=21, I am at y=9.\n\nNow, but I need to go through row 5,6,7,8.\n\nRow 5 is safe at ΔT=2,3,4,5.\n\nIn my plan, I am on row 5 at t=17, ΔT=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 at t=18, ΔT=3, safe.\n\nBut row 6 unsafe at ΔT=6,7, t=21,22.\n\nAt t=21, I am not on row 6.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut can I be faster?\n\nSuppose I go up at t=15 to y=5 at t=16, but at t=16, y=5, ΔT=1, unsafe, collision, impossible.\n\nSo I must not be on row 5 at t=16.\n\nTherefore, at t=15, I cannot go up; I must stay or go down.\n\nIf I stay at t=15, then at t=16, I can go up to y=5 at t=17, as before.\n\nIf at t=15 I go down to y=3 at t=16, then I am lower, so it takes longer to go up.\n\nFor example, from y=3 to y=9, 6 steps, reaching at t=21 or later.\n\nt=15: D, y16=3\n\nt=16: U, y17=4\n\nt=17: U, y18=5\n\nt=18: U, y19=6\n\nt=19: U, y20=7\n\nt=20: U, y21=8\n\nt=21: U, y22=9\n\nReach at t=22, later than before.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo best to stay at t=15.\n\nBut in my first plan, I reached at t=21 with H=7.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose I go to y=5 later.\n\nFor example, at t=15, S, y16=4\n\nt=16, S, y17=4? Then at t=17, U to y=5 at t=18.\n\nBut then slower.\n\nt=17: y=4, U, y18=5\n\nt=18: y=5, U, y19=6\n\nt=19: U, y20=7\n\nt=20: U, y21=8\n\nt=21: U, y22=9\n\nReach at t=22, worse.\n\nSo my first plan is better.\n\nPerhaps I can move faster through some rows.\n\nBut row 5 must be avoided at t=16, so I have to start moving at t=16 to y=5 at t=17.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nBut at t=19, I am at y=7, row 7, ΔT=4, safe.\n\nBut row 7 is unsafe at ΔT=6,7, t=21,22.\n\nNot an issue.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 at t=20, ΔT=5, safe.\n\nCan I reach y=9 at t=20?\n\nThat would require y20=9.\n\nSince y15=4, I need to increase by 5 in 5 steps: from t=15 to t=20, that's 5 actions.\n\ny16, y17, y18, y19, y20.\n\nWith y20=9.\n\nSo y16 must be at least 5, since each step +1 max.\n\ny16 = y15 + a15, so if a15=U, y16=5\n\nThen y17=6 if U, etc.\n\nBut y16=5 at t=16, which is row 5 at ΔT=1, unsafe, collision.\n\nIf y16=4, then y17<=5, y18<=6, y19<=7, y20<=8 <9, cannot reach y=9 at t=20.\n\nIf y16=5, collision.\n\nSo impossible to reach at t=20.\n\nThus, minimum reach at t=21, with y21=9.\n\nH such that t1 + H -1 =21, t1=15, so 15 + H -1 =21, H=7.\n\nActions: from t=15 to t=20 to get to y21=9, but actions at t=15 to t=20 determine y16 to y21.\n\ny15 given.\n\na15 determines y16\n\na16 determines y17\n\n...\n\na20 determines y21\n\nSo actions at t=15,16,17,18,19,20: 6 actions.\n\nThen for sequence, H=7, actions from t=0 to 6: a15 to a21.\n\nBut a21 is at turn 21, which determines y22, but we need y21=9, which is set by a20.\n\nSo a21 can be anything, but we list it.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t1 + H -1 =21, we list action a21.\n\nNow, for the plan:\n\nTurn 15: action S (since we stay)\n\nIn the sequence: a15 = S\n\nThen y16=4\n\nTurn 16: action U, so y17=5\n\nTurn 17: action U, y18=6\n\nTurn 18: action U, y19=7\n\nTurn 19: action U, y20=8\n\nTurn 20: action U, y21=9\n\nNow at turn 21, position y21=9, so we need to list action for turn 21, say a21 = S or whatever.\n\nBut in the sequence for t=0 to H-1, H=7, t=0 to 6: a15 to a21.\n\na15 to a20 are as above, a21 can be S.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, we need to specify actions.\n\nNow, but let's confirm the safety.\n\nt=15: y=4, row 4, ΔT=0, safe\n\nt=16: y=4, row 4, ΔT=1, safe (unsafe only at 4,5)\n\nt=17: y=5, row 5, ΔT=2, safe (unsafe 0,1,6,7; 2 ok)\n\nt=18: y=6, row 6, ΔT=3, safe\n\nt=19: y=7, row 7, ΔT=4, safe (unsafe 0,1,6,7; 4 ok)\n\nt=20: y=8, row 8, ΔT=5, safe (unsafe 0,1,6,7; 5 ok)\n\nt=21: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, for rows 5-8, they are unsafe at ΔT=6,7, which is t=21,22.\n\nAt t=21, if I were on y=5,6,7,8, it would be unsafe, but I am at y=9, so fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, is there a way to reach in fewer turns? H smaller?\n\nH=7, but if H=6, then t1 + H -1 =15+6-1=20, so y20=9.\n\nBut as above, impossible to have y20=9 without collision or not reaching.\n\nThus, minimal H=7.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: S  (or any, but since at y=9, S is fine)\n\nBut for turn 21, action a21, which we must specify.\n\nIn the sequence up to turn t1 + H -1 =21.\n\nNow, in the answer, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 15: S Turn 16: U Turn 17: U Turn 18: U Turn 19: U Turn 20: U Turn 21: S }\n\nBut H=7, turns from 15 to 21.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid the initial stay.\n\nAnother idea: at t=15, instead of staying, can I go down to y=3? But then I need more moves to come back, so worse.\n\nOr, since row 5 is safe at ΔT=2,3,etc., but I have to be on row 5 at t=17, which I did.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to higher rows.\n\nBut I have to go through each row sequentially.\n\nUnless I can skip, but y changes by at most 1, so I must visit each integer y from 4 to 9, but not necessarily, I can go down and up, but inefficient.\n\nSo I think the plan is optimal.\n\nBut in row 5, it is safe at ΔT=2, which is t=17, and I am there.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's check row 4 at unsafe times: ΔT=4,5, t=19,20.\n\nAt t=19, I am at y=7, not 4.\n\nt=20, y=8, not 4.\n\nSo fine.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7.\n\nSequence of actions:\n\nAt turn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: S  (for example)\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 21, since we are at y=9, we can choose any action, but to be safe, S is fine.\n\nIn the output, we need to list for each turn.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 15: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: S }\n\nBut H=7, and turns from 15 to 21.\n\nBut turn 21 is t1 + H -1 =15+7-1=21, yes.\n\nAnd y21=9.\n\nActions from t=15 to t=21.\n\na15 to a21.\n\na15=S, a16=U, a17=U, a18=U, a19=U, a20=U, a21=S.\n\nNow, but a21 is at turn 21, which affects y22, but since we reached at turn 21, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can set a21 to U, but y=9, so y22=9 still, or D to 8, but not necessary.\n\nS is fine.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 21, we need to specify an action.\n\nIn the collision, at turn 21, y=9, no collision.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nTo be precise, the action at turn t1 + H -1 is listed, but since position is already 9, it doesn't matter for reaching.\n\nSo this should be the answer.\n\nBut let's confirm the car for row 5 at ΔT=2.\n\nt=17, ΔT=2, row 5.\n\nCars: car 1: never covers\n\ncar 2: covers ΔT=6,7\n\ncar 3: covers ΔT=0,1\n\nSo at ΔT=2, no car covers x=0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nPerhaps I can start moving later but no.\n\nAnother path: suppose at t=15, I go up? But to y=5 at t=16, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nOr, at t=15, S, y16=4\n\nThen at t=16, instead of U, I could go to y=5 at t=17, which I did.\n\nIf I stay at t=16, y17=4, then later, but slower.\n\nSo yes.\n\nThus, minimal H=7.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nIn the sequence, I have Turn 21: S, but since the goal is to reach at turn 21, and action at turn 21 is after, but it's included.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I could set H smaller, but I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that after H turns, we have reached, but with the indexing.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nBut for turn 21, since we are at y=9, and we take S, y22=9, still at goal, but we reached at turn 21.\n\nIn the position, at turn 21, we are at y=9, so reached.\n\nAction at turn 21 doesn't change that we reached at that turn.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nNow, in the boxed answer.\n\nBut let's write it.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 15\\) is 7, with the sequence of actions ensuring no collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n- At turn 15, the player is at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4). Freeway 4 is safe at \\(\\Delta T = 0\\) (no car covers \\(x = 0\\)), so staying (S) is safe, and the position remains \\(y = 4\\).\n- At turn 16, the player is at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4). Freeway 4 is safe at \\(\\Delta T = 1\\) (unsafe only at \\(\\Delta T = 4, 5\\)), so moving up (U) is safe, and the position moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 17.\n- At turn 17, the player is at \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5). Freeway 5 is safe at \\(\\Delta T = 2\\) (unsafe at \\(\\Delta T = 0, 1, 6, 7\\)), so moving up (U) is safe, and the position moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 18.\n- At turn 18, the player is at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6). Freeway 6 is safe at \\(\\Delta T = 3\\) (unsafe at \\(\\Delta T = 0, 1, 6, 7\\)), so moving up (U) is safe, and the position moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 19.\n- At turn 19, the player is at \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7). Freeway 7 is safe at \\(\\Delta T = 4\\) (unsafe at \\(\\Delta T = 0, 1, 6, 7\\)), so moving up (U) is safe, and the position moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 20.\n- At turn 20, the player is at \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8). Freeway 8 is safe at \\(\\Delta T = 5\\) (unsafe at \\(\\Delta T = 0, 1, 6, 7\\)), so moving up (U) is safe, and the position moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 21.\n- At turn 21, the player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway, so no collision is possible. The action stay (S) is chosen, but any action is acceptable since the goal is reached at this turn.\n\nThis sequence reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 15 + 7 - 1 = 21\\) with \\(H = 7\\), which is minimal because reaching at turn 20 (\\(H = 6\\)) would require being at \\(y = 5\\) at turn 16 (\\(\\Delta T = 1\\)), but freeway 5 is unsafe at \\(\\Delta T = 1\\), causing a collision.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 15: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: S }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1=16, and I start at y=4.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. All cars are moving right with speed 6. For each car, the span at time T is given by:\n\nSince they're right-moving, span(T) = [τ + s*(T - t1), h + s*(T - t1)]\n\nt1 is 16, s is 6 for all.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t1, so for time T, Δt = T - 16.\n\nThen for a right-moving car, span(T) = [τ + 6*Δt, h + 6*Δt]\n\nNow, collision happens at turn T if the player is on a freeway y at that turn, and for the car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at that turn. Meaning, the car covers x=0 at that time.\n\nBut the player is at x=0 always, since it's (0,y), so when on freeway y, if at turn T, 0 is in span for that freeway's car, collision.\n\nAlso, importantly, when I move to a new y, at the turn I move, I'm not on the new y yet for collision purposes. So if I move at turn T from y to y+1, at turn T I'm still on y, so I only care about cars on y at turn T. Then at turn T+1, I'm on y+1, so I care about cars on y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nSimilarly for down moves.\n\nNow, the player position: I start at y=4 at t=16.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny can be from 0 to 9, but y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars, I think? The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so safe.\n\nThe grid has vertical axis y=0 to 9, freeways on y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe zones with no cars.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,4), which is on freeway y=4, I think? Position (0,4), and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=4 is a freeway, so there are cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so when on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nBut I need to reach (0,9), which is y=9, so once I'm there, I'm safe.\n\nNow, actions: U for up, D for down, S for stay.\n\ny changes by +1, -1, or 0, but clamped to [0,9], so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nSince I start at 4 and want to go to 9, I need to go up, so probably U actions, but I have to avoid cars on the way.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states.\n\nFor each freeway, there are multiple cars, but all with same speed and direction, right-moving at speed 6.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: cars: (48,37,right,6) and (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nSince right-moving, head and tail: for (48,37), head is 48, tail is 37? But usually for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, I think.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, it says [τ, h] and then [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt]\n\nIn the car state, it says (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor right-moving, h should be greater than τ, I assume, because the car is moving right, so head is the front.\n\nIn the first one: (48,37,right,6), so h=48, τ=37, so head=48, tail=37, so the car is from 37 to 48, length 11.\n\nSimilarly, (-18,-29,right,6), h=-18, τ=-29? -18 > -29, so from -29 to -18, length 11? -18 - (-29) = 11, yes.\n\nNow, for freeway 1, both cars are similar.\n\nBut let's see freeway 5 and 6 have three cars.\n\nFirst, all freeways from 1 to 8 have cars, but freeways 1-4 have two cars each, 5-8 have three cars each? Let's see:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars\n\nFreeway 2: two cars\n\nFreeway 3: two cars\n\nFreeway 4: two cars\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (48,37,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6), (6,-5,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nAnd freeways 1-4: both cars are (48,37,right,6) and (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nIn freeway 1-4, it's (48,37,right,6) and (-18,-29,right,6), which are the same for all.\n\nSimilarly for 5-8, (48,37,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6), (6,-5,right,6)\n\nNow, for each car, I need to find when it covers x=0 for its freeway.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway and time T, if there is a car such that 0 is in [τ + 6Δt, h + 6Δt] for that car, where Δt = T - 16.\n\nCollision if 0 is in that interval for any car on that freeway at time T.\n\nSince the player is at x=0.\n\nNow, for the interval [a,b], 0 in [a,b] means a <= 0 <= b.\n\nFor a right-moving car, span is [τ + 6Δt, h + 6Δt], and since h > τ, the interval is from smaller to larger, so min to max.\n\nIn notation, [τ + 6Δt, h + 6Δt], and since τ < h, it's [left, right] with left < right.\n\nSo 0 in [left, right] iff left <= 0 <= right.\n\nSimilarly for all.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway, when it is occupied at x=0, meaning when collision happens if player is on that freeway.\n\nSince cars are moving, the occupancy changes with time.\n\nI need to find times when for a given freeway, no car covers x=0, so it's safe to be on that freeway at that time.\n\nBut since multiple cars, I need the times when all cars do not cover x=0.\n\nSo for each freeway, find the times T when for all cars on that freeway, 0 not in [τ + 6Δt, h + 6Δt] for Δt = T-16.\n\nWhich means for each car, either τ + 6Δt > 0 or h + 6Δt < 0.\n\nSince the intervals might overlap, but I need the union of times when it's not covered.\n\nEasier to find when it is covered and invert.\n\nBut let's compute for each car when it covers x=0.\n\nFor a car, it covers x=0 when τ + 6Δt <= 0 <= h + 6Δt\n\nSince τ < h.\n\nSo solve for Δt:\n\nτ + 6Δt <= 0 and 0 <= h + 6Δt\n\nWhich is:\n\n6Δt <= -τ and 6Δt >= -h\n\nSo Δt <= -τ/6 and Δt >= -h/6\n\nSince τ and h could be negative, let's keep signs.\n\nFrom τ + 6Δt <= 0, so 6Δt <= -τ, so Δt <= -τ/6\n\nFrom 0 <= h + 6Δt, so 6Δt >= -h, so Δt >= -h/6\n\nSo the car covers x=0 when -h/6 <= Δt <= -τ/6\n\nBecause Δt >= -h/6 and Δt <= -τ/6\n\nNow, since h > τ, -h/6 < -τ/6, so it's an interval [ -h/6, -τ/6 ]\n\nFor example, car (48,37,right,6): h=48, τ=37\n\nThen Δt >= -48/6 = -8\n\nΔt <= -37/6 ≈ -6.1667\n\nSo covers when -8 <= Δt <= -37/6\n\n-37/6 = -6.1667, so approximately [-8, -6.1667]\n\nSimilarly, for car (-18,-29,right,6): h=-18, τ=-29\n\nΔt >= -(-18)/6 = 18/6 = 3\n\nΔt <= -(-29)/6 = 29/6 ≈ 4.8333\n\nSo covers when 3 <= Δt <= 29/6 ≈ 4.8333\n\nNow for freeway 1, cars are these two.\n\nFreeway 1 is occupied at x=0 when either car covers it.\n\nFirst car covers when Δt in [-8, -37/6] ≈ [-8, -6.1667]\n\nSecond car covers when Δt in [3, 4.8333]\n\nSince t1=16, T = t1 + Δt, so for Δt from -8 to -6.1667, which is T from 16-8=8 to 16-6.1667≈9.833, but T is turn number, integer, I think.\n\nT should be integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nSimilarly, Δt integer? Δt = T - t1, T and t1 integers, so Δt integer.\n\nIn the inequality, Δt must be integer, but the coverage might be for non-integer, but since we check at integer turns, we need to see at integer Δt.\n\nFor example, car 1 covers when Δt >= -8 and Δt <= -37/6 ≈ -6.1667, so since Δt integer, Δt <= -7? Let's see.\n\n-37/6 = -6 - 1/6 ≈ -6.1667, so Δt <= floor(-6.1667) for the upper bound? No.\n\nThe inequality is Δt <= -τ/6 and Δt >= -h/6\n\nFor car 1, h=48, τ=37\n\n- h/6 = -48/6 = -8\n\n- τ/6 = -37/6 ≈ -6.1667\n\nSo Δt >= -8 and Δt <= -6.1667\n\nSince Δt integer, possible Δt: -8, -7, and -6? Δt <= -6.1667, so Δt <= -7? -7 < -6.1667? -7 = -7.0 < -6.1667 is true? No:\n\n-7.0 < -6.1667, yes, because -7.0 is smaller.\n\nNumerically: -7.0 = -42/6, -6.1667 = -37/6, -42/6 < -37/6, so yes.\n\nΔt <= -37/6 ≈ -6.1667, so since Δt integer, Δt <= -7, because -7 = -7.0 <= -6.1667? -7.0 < -6.1667, but -7.0 <= -6.1667 is true? Inequality: is -7 <= -6.1667? Yes, because -7 is less than -6.1667.\n\nBut -37/6 = -6.1667, so Δt <= -37/6 ≈ -6.1667\n\nFor integers, Δt that satisfy Δt <= -6.1667 are Δt <= -7, because -7 = -7.0 < -6.1667, and -6 = -6.0 > -6.1667? -6.0 = -6.0, -6.1667, so -6.0 > -6.1667, so -6.0 is greater, so not <= -6.1667.\n\nSimilarly, Δt >= -8.\n\nSo Δt >= -8 and Δt <= -7, because -8 <= -8, -7 <= -7.0 <= -6.1667? -7.0 = -7.0, -6.1667, -7.0 < -6.1667, so -7.0 <= -6.1667 is true.\n\nThen Δt = -6: -6.0 > -6.1667, so -6.0 > -6.1667, so not <= -6.1667.\n\nSo for car 1, it covers at integer Δt when Δt = -8 and Δt = -7.\n\nSimilarly, at Δt = -8: τ + 6Δt = 37 + 6*(-8) = 37 - 48 = -11, h + 6Δt = 48 - 48 = 0, so span [ -11, 0], so 0 is included.\n\nAt Δt = -7: τ +6Δt = 37 +6*(-7) = 37 -42 = -5, h+6Δt=48-42=6, span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt Δt = -6: τ +6*(-6) =37-36=1, h+6*(-6)=48-36=12, span [1,12], 0 not in, since 0<1.\n\nSimilarly, at Δt=-7, covered, Δt=-6 not covered.\n\nSo for car 1, covers at Δt=-8 and Δt=-7.\n\nSimilarly, for the second car on freeway 1: (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nh=-18, τ=-29\n\nΔt >= -h/6 = -(-18)/6 = 18/6=3\n\nΔt <= -τ/6 = -(-29)/6 = 29/6 ≈4.8333\n\nSo Δt >=3 and Δt <=4.8333\n\nInteger Δt: 3,4\n\nAt Δt=3: τ +6*3 = -29 +18 = -11, h+18= -18+18=0, span [-11,0], 0 in\n\nAt Δt=4: τ+24= -29+24= -5, h+24= -18+24=6, span [-5,6], 0 in\n\nAt Δt=5: τ+30= -29+30=1, h+30= -18+30=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo covers at Δt=3 and 4.\n\nThus for freeway 1, occupied at x=0 when:\n\nFrom car1: at Δt=-8,-7\n\nFrom car2: at Δt=3,4\n\nSo overall, at Δt=-8,-7,3,4\n\nSince t1=16, T=16 + Δt, so T=8,9 (for Δt=-8,-7) and T=19,20 (for Δt=3,4)\n\nT=16 + (-8) =8, 16-7=9, 16+3=19, 16+4=20.\n\nSo at turns 8,9,19,20, freeway 1 is occupied at x=0.\n\nBut turn 8 and 9 are in the past, since current is t=16, so for future, only T=19 and 20 are relevant for collision risk.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, since freeways 1-4 have the same cars, so same for all freeways 1,2,3,4.\n\nFreeways 1-4 all have the same two cars, so for each of y=1,2,3,4, at T=19 and 20, it is occupied.\n\nNow, for freeways 5-8, they have three cars.\n\nFreeway 5: cars (48,37,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6), (6,-5,right,6)\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\nFirst car (48,37,right,6): same as before, covers at Δt=-8,-7 as above.\n\nBut for freeway 5, it's different.\n\nCar1: (48,37,right,6) same as before, covers at Δt=-8,-7\n\nBut Δt=-8,-7 are past, T=8,9, not future.\n\nNow second car: (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nh=-30, τ=-41\n\nΔt >= -h/6 = -(-30)/6 = 30/6=5\n\nΔt <= -τ/6 = -(-41)/6 = 41/6 ≈6.8333\n\nSo Δt >=5 and Δt <=6.8333\n\nInteger Δt: 5,6\n\nAt Δt=5: τ +30= -41+30= -11, h+30= -30+30=0, span [-11,0], 0 in\n\nAt Δt=6: τ+36= -41+36= -5, h+36= -30+36=6, span [-5,6], 0 in\n\nAt Δt=7: τ+42= -41+42=1, h+42= -30+42=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo covers at Δt=5,6\n\nThird car: (6,-5,right,6)\n\nh=6, τ=-5\n\nΔt >= -h/6 = -6/6 = -1\n\nΔt <= -τ/6 = -(-5)/6 = 5/6 ≈0.8333\n\nSo Δt >= -1 and Δt <= 0.8333\n\nInteger Δt: -1, 0\n\nAt Δt=-1: τ +6*(-1)= -5 -6= -11, h-6=6-6=0, span [-11,0], 0 in\n\nAt Δt=0: τ +0= -5, h+0=6, span [-5,6], 0 in\n\nAt Δt=1: τ+6= -5+6=1, h+6=6+6=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo covers at Δt=-1 and 0.\n\nΔt=0 is T=t1=16.\n\nNow for freeway 5, occupied at x=0 when:\n\nFrom car1: Δt=-8,-7 (past)\n\nCar2: Δt=5,6\n\nCar3: Δt=-1,0\n\nSo overall, at Δt=-8,-7,-1,0,5,6\n\nIn terms of T: Δt=-8,T=8; Δt=-7,T=9; Δt=-1,T=15; Δt=0,T=16; Δt=5,T=21; Δt=6,T=22\n\nSince current turn is t=16, so for future, T=21 and 22 are occupied.\n\nBut also at T=16, Δt=0, it is occupied now, at t=16.\n\nBut player is at y=4 at t=16, and freeway y=4 is occupied? Freeway y=4 is for freeways 1-4, which we have.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nFreeway k corresponds to y=k, I assume.\n\nIn the table, freeway k, and y=1 to 8.\n\nSo for each y, the freeway number is the y-level.\n\nSo at position (0,y), for y=1 to 8, it's on freeway y.\n\nNow for freeway 5, y=5, at T=16, Δt=0, it is occupied by car3.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 6,7,8 same as 5.\n\nFirst, for freeways 1-4 (y=1,2,3,4):\n\nOccupied at T=19,20 (future)\n\nAt T=16, are they occupied?\n\nFor y=4, freeway 4, cars same as freeway 1: at T=16, Δt=0.\n\nFor car1: at Δt=0, τ=37, h=48, span [37,48], 0 not in, since 37>0.\n\nCar2: at Δt=0, τ=-29, h=-18, span [-29,-18], 0 not in, since -18<0? -29 to -18, both negative, so 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=16, for y=1,2,3,4, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly for y=5,6,7,8: at T=16, for freeway 5, car3 covers at Δt=0, so occupied.\n\nSpecifically, for y=5 at T=16, occupied.\n\nPlayer is at y=4 at t=16, which is not occupied, as above.\n\nNow back to freeways 5-8: occupied at T=21,22 from car2, and at T=16 from car3.\n\nCar2 at Δt=5,6 T=21,22; car3 at Δt=0, T=16.\n\nBut car1 is past, not future.\n\nSo for y=5,6,7,8, occupied at T=16,21,22.\n\nT=16 is now, but player not on it yet.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=4 to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nI start at t=16, y=4.\n\nI can take actions: U, D, S.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, 0, but clamped.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since from 4 to 9, difference 5, so at least 5 turns if I go up every time, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nBut y=5 to 8 might have cars at certain times.\n\nNow, the critical times for each freeway:\n\nFor y=1,2,3,4: only occupied at T=19,20\n\nFor y=5,6,7,8: occupied at T=16,21,22\n\nT=16 is current turn, but at turn T, when I am on a freeway, I need it not occupied at that turn.\n\nAt t=16, I am on y=4, which is not occupied at t=16, as above.\n\nNow, if I stay at y=4, at t=17, I need to check if y=4 is occupied at t=17.\n\nSimilarly for other times.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when it is safe, i.e., not occupied at x=0.\n\nSince we care about integer T.\n\nAlso, for future planning, from t=16 onwards.\n\nFirst, for y=1,2,3,4: occupied only at T=19,20, so safe at all other times, including T=16,17,18,21,22,etc.\n\nT=19 and 20 occupied, so safe for T<=18 and T>=21.\n\nT=18: for y=4, at T=18, Δt=18-16=2.\n\nFor car1: at Δt=2, τ+12=37+12=49, h+12=48+12=60, span [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nCar2: at Δt=2, τ+12= -29+12= -17, h+12= -18+12= -6, span [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSo yes, safe at T=18.\n\nT=21: Δt=5, τ+30=37+30=67, h+30=78, no; car2: τ+30= -29+30=1, h+30= -18+30=12, span [1,12], 0 not in? 0<1, not in, so safe at T=21?

At T=22, Δt=6, same as above.\n\nT=23: Δt=7, car2: τ+42= -41+42=1, h+42=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nCar1 and car3 not cover, so safe at T=23.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5-8, occupied only at T=16,21,22.\n\nSafe at other times.\n\nNow, y=9 and y=0 safe always.\n\nPlayer starts at t=16, y=4.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible paths: I can go up directly, but need to avoid being on y=5-8 when they are occupied.\n\ny=5-8 occupied at T=16,21,22.\n\nAt T=16, I am not on them, I am on y=4.\n\nIf I move to y=5 at t=17, for example.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nI need to be on each freeway only when it is safe.\n\nSince I move one step per turn, I need to plan the sequence.\n\nMinimal H: I need to increase y by 5, so at least 5 moves up.\n\nBut I might need to stay or go down to wait.\n\nFirst, can I go up directly in 5 turns?\n\nStart t=16, y=4.\n\nAfter action at t=16, I move to new position at t=17.\n\nThe position after action.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position (0, y_t)\n\nI choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, with delta based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1})\n\nCollision at turn T if when I am on freeway y_T, it is occupied at that turn.\n\nSo for each turn, depending on where I am.\n\nI start at t=16, y=4. At this turn, y=4 is not occupied, so no collision.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nI need to specify actions from t=16 to t=16+H-1, and at turn t=16+H-1, y=9.\n\nThe last action is at t=16+H-1, which sets y for that turn? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, I perform action a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nBut the position at turn t is y_t.\n\nSequence: at time t, position y_t, then I do a_t, then at time t+1, position y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y_t.\n\nAnd collision at time t if on freeway y_t and occupied at t.\n\nSimilarly, at time t+1, if on freeway y_{t+1} and occupied at t+1.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn T, meaning at that turn, position y_T=9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, no issue.\n\nNow, minimal H: from t=16 to T, with y_T=9, and y_{16}=4.\n\nThe number of turns from start to end is T - 16, but H is the number of actions? Let's see the task.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nt1=16, so actions from t=16 to t=16 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, I have moved H steps in time, so at turn t=16 + H, I am at position after the last action.\n\nSet t = t1 + k for k=0 to H-1 for actions.\n\nAt turn t1 + k, I perform action a_{t1+k}, which sets y_{t1+k+1}\n\nThe position at turn t1 is y_{t1} =4.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nAnd we need to specify actions for t from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThe sequence is for t= t1 to t1+H-1, actions.\n\nAt turn t, for t from t1 to t1+H-1, we have position y_t, and we need no collision at each of these turns, and at turn t1+H, position y_{t1+H}=9, which is safe.\n\nAt turn t1+H, if y=9, safe, no collision.\n\nBut we don't care about collision at t1+H if not on freeway, but since y=9 not freeway, fine.\n\nNow, the path: we start at t=16, y=4.\n\nAfter action a_16, y_17 = y_16 + delta\n\nThen at t=17, y_17, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T if on freeway y_T and occupied at T.\n\nNow, y_T must be between 1 and 8 for collision possible.\n\nNow, from y=4 to y=9, I need to go up.\n\nThe dangerous times are when freeways are occupied.\n\nSpecifically, y=1-4 occupied at T=19,20\n\ny=5-8 occupied at T=21,22\n\nBut y=1-4 are below, I am at y=4, going up, so I probably won't go down, but I could to avoid.\n\nFirst, direct path: go up each turn.\n\nSuppose I go up at each turn starting t=16.\n\nThen:\n\nAt t=16, y=4, action a_16=U, then y_17=5\n\nAt t=17, y=5, action a_17=U, y_18=6\n\nAt t=18, y=6, action a_18=U, y_19=7\n\nAt t=19, y=7, action a_19=U, y_20=8\n\nAt t=20, y=8, action a_20=U, y_21=9\n\nNow, check collision at each turn.\n\nAt t=16: y=4, freeway 4, not occupied at t=16, safe.\n\nAt t=17: y=5, freeway 5, occupied at t=17? Earlier we saw for y=5, occupied at T=16,21,22, not at T=17.\n\nT=17 safe, as above.\n\nAt t=18: y=6, similarly, for y=6, same as y=5, occupied at T=16,21,22, not at T=18, safe.\n\nAt t=19: y=7, freeway 7, occupied? y=7 same as y=5, occupied at T=16,21,22, not at T=19, safe.\n\nAt t=20: y=8, freeway 8, occupied at T=16,21,22, not at T=20, safe.\n\nThen at t=21: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nBut at t=20, I am at y=8, and action U, so at t=21, y=9.\n\nNow, collision at t=20: y=8, not occupied, safe.\n\nAnd y=9 at t=21 safe.\n\nBut in this sequence, I reached y=9 at t=21.\n\nt=21 is turn t1 + H? t1=16, at t=21, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=16 to t=20, actions at t=16,17,18,19,20, so 5 actions.\n\nH=5, turns from t=16 to t=20 for actions, position at t=21 is y=9.\n\nNow, check if any collision during.\n\nt=16: y=4, safe\n\nt=17: y=5, for y=5, at t=17, not occupied, safe\n\nt=18: y=6, not occupied, safe\n\nt=19: y=7, not occupied, safe\n\nt=20: y=8, not occupied, safe\n\nt=21: y=9, safe\n\nAll good, and I didn't hit any occupied times.\n\ny=5-8 occupied only at T=16,21,22, and I was on them at t=17,18,19,20, all safe times.\n\nT=17,18,19,20 are safe for y=5-8.\n\nAnd y=4 at t=16 safe.\n\nSo I can go directly up in 5 moves, reaching y=9 at t=21.\n\nBut is there a faster way? From y=4 to y=9, min 5 up moves, so min H=5 actions, which I achieved.\n\nBut let me confirm the times.\n\nt=16: position y=4, not occupied.\n\nAction U, so y_17=5\n\nt=17: position y=5, freeway 5, at t=17, not occupied, as above.\n\nAction U, y_18=6\n\nt=18: y=6, not occupied, action U, y_19=7\n\nt=19: y=7, not occupied, action U, y_20=8\n\nt=20: y=8, not occupied, action U, y_21=9\n\nt=21: y=9, safe.\n\nAnd at t=21, y=9 reached.\n\nNow, what about the occupied times: at T=19,20, y=1-4 are occupied, but I am not on them, I am on y=7 and 8, which are safe at that time.\n\nSimilarly, at T=21, y=5-8 occupied, but at t=21, I am at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nIf I were on y=8 at t=21, it would be occupied, but I moved to y=9 at t=21, so position at t=21 is y=9.\n\nIn terms of the turn: at turn t=21, position is y=21=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nAnd for the freeway, at t=21, y=5-8 are occupied, but since I am not on them, no issue.\n\nSo this seems fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have actions from t=16 to t=20.\n\nThe minimal H is 5.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn this case, all actions are U.\n\nBut let me make sure about the collision rule.\n\nWhen I move at turn T, if I move to a new y, at turn T I am still on the old y.\n\nIn this sequence, when I move at t=17 from y=5? At t=17, I am at position y=5, and I perform action, say U, which means I move to y=6 at t=18.\n\nAt the moment of turn t=17, I am on y=5, and I check if freeway y=5 is occupied at t=17, which it is not.\n\nSimilarly, at t=20, I am on y=8, perform U, go to y=9 at t=21.\n\nAt t=20, y=8 is not occupied, so safe.\n\nNow, at t=21, I am on y=9, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I start by staying or something, but I start at y=4, to go to y=9, I need at least 5 up moves, so cannot reach before t=21.\n\nt=16 y=4, after 1 up, t=17 y=5, after 2, t=18 y=6, ..., after 5 ups, t=21 y=9.\n\nSo minimal time to reach y=9 is t=21, with 5 actions.\n\nAnd I have a sequence with no collision.\n\nBut in the car states, for y=5-8, at t=16 they are occupied, but I am not on them at t=16.\n\nSimilarly, at t=21, they are occupied, but I am not on them at t=21.\n\nIn the sequence above, I am on y=5 at t=17, not t=16; y=6 at t=18, etc.\n\nAnd t=17 to 20 are safe.\n\nBut what about t=19 and 20 for y=1-4? I am not on them.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 5 at t=17.\n\ny=5, t=17, Δt=1.\n\nCars: car1 (48,37): at Δt=1, τ+6=43, h+6=54, span [43,54], not cover 0.\n\nCar2 (-30,-41): τ+6= -41+6= -35, h+6= -30+6= -24, span [-35,-24], not cover 0.\n\nCar3 (6,-5): τ+6= -5+6=1, h+6=12, span [1,12], not cover 0.\n\nYes, safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo the sequence should be all U from t=16 to t=20.\n\nBut the actions are at each turn.\n\nAnswer format: for each turn, the action.\n\nSo for turn t_1=16: U\n\nTurn t_1 +1 =17: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 20: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 21, y=9.\n\nH=5.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t=16 to t=20, 5 actions.\n\nNow, but in the car list, for freeways 5-8, there is a car (6,-5) which at t=16 covers, but at t=17 it is gone.\n\nSimilarly, at t=21, car2 covers for y=5-8.\n\nBut in my path, I avoid those times.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother thing: if I go up faster, but I can only move one per turn.\n\nUnless I start by moving up immediately.\n\nBut in this case, it works.\n\nBut let me see if there is a problem at t=19 or something.\n\nt=19: for y=1-4 occupied, but I am on y=7, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo minimal H=5 with all U.\n\nBut the player is at (0,4) at t=16, and I need to reach (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, after actions, I reach at t=21.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=4? That would mean I reach y=9 at t=20.\n\nBut from y=4 to y=9 in 4 moves? Each move up increases y by 1, but y from 4 to 9 is 5 steps, so I need at least 5 moves to increase by 5, so impossible in less than 5 actions.\n\nUnless I can jump, but no, only +1, -1, 0.\n\nSo min H=5.\n\nAnd I have a sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5, there is a car at (6,-5) which at t=16 covers, but I am not on it.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut let me confirm for freeway 4 at t=16.\n\nPlayer at y=4, t=16.\n\nFreeway 4: cars (48,37) and (-18,-29)\n\nAt t=16, Δt=0, span [37,48] and [-29,-18], neither contains 0, so safe.\n\nThen I go to y=5 at t=17, safe as above.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 21, y=9.\n\nH=5.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be in the box.\n\nBut let me see the format.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\"\n\nSo Turn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\netc.\n\nUp to Turn 20: U? t_1 + H -1 =16 +5 -1=20, yes.\n\nActions from t=16 to t=20.\n\nNow, but in the car list, for freeways 5-8, there is an extra car, but in my path, I don't encounter it.\n\nPerhaps I should check if at some point I might be on a freeway when occupied, but no.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, at the turn of move, I am on the current freeway.\n\nFor example, at t=20, I am on y=8, which is not occupied, then I move to y=9.\n\nAt t=21, y=9.\n\ny=8 at t=20 not occupied.\n\nNow, but at t=21, if I were on y=8, it would be occupied, but I am not.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps for y=5-8, at t=16 they are occupied, but since I start at y=4, and move later, fine.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I do with min turns.\n\nPerhaps I can do with staying, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nFor example, if I stay at some point, H>5.\n\nSo min H=5 with all U.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 16\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Occupancy at x=0\nThe cars on each freeway move right with speed 6. The occupancy at x=0 is determined for each freeway at relevant turns, where collision occurs if the player is on the freeway and x=0 is within the car's span at that turn.\n\n- **Freeways 1-4 (y=1,2,3,4)**:  \n  Cars: (48, 37, right, 6) and (-18, -29, right, 6)  \n  Occupied at turns: 19, 20  \n  Safe at all other turns, including 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, etc.\n\n- **Freeways 5-8 (y=5,6,7,8)**:  \n  Cars: (48, 37, right, 6), (-30, -41, right, 6), (6, -5, right, 6)  \n  Occupied at turns: 16, 21, 22  \n  Safe at all other turns, including 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, etc.\n\n- **y=0 and y=9**: Always safe, as they are not freeways.\n\n### Path to (0, 9) with Minimal Turns\nThe player must increase y from 4 to 9, requiring at least 5 upward moves (U actions) to achieve a net change of +5. A sequence of 5 consecutive U actions from turn 16 to turn 20 reaches y=9 at turn 21 without collisions:\n- At turn 16: Player at y=4 (safe, as y=4 not occupied at turn 16). Action U moves to y=5 at turn 17.\n- At turn 17: Player at y=5 (safe, as y=5 not occupied at turn 17). Action U moves to y=6 at turn 18.\n- At turn 18: Player at y=6 (safe, as y=6 not occupied at turn 18). Action U moves to y=7 at turn 19.\n- At turn 19: Player at y=7 (safe, as y=7 not occupied at turn 19). Action U moves to y=8 at turn 20.\n- At turn 20: Player at y=8 (safe, as y=8 not occupied at turn 20). Action U moves to y=9 at turn 21.\n\nAt turn 21, y=9 is reached, which is safe. The turns 17 to 20 avoid the occupancy periods of freeways 5-8 (occupied at 16, 21, 22) and freeways 1-4 (occupied at 19, 20), as the player is not on these freeways at the occupied times.\n\nThis sequence uses H=5 turns (actions from turn 16 to turn 20) and is minimal, as fewer actions cannot achieve the required +5 change in y.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- Turn 16: U\n- Turn 17: U\n- Turn 18: U\n- Turn 19: U\n- Turn 20: U\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 16: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: & U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,5) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1=17, and I'm at y=5.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. All cars are moving right with speed 6. That means for any car, at turn T, the span is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)] since they're right-moving. t1 is 17, so s(T - 17) is the distance moved.\n\ns is speed, which is 6 for all cars. So for any car, at time T, the head and tail are both increased by 6*(T - 17).\n\nThe collision happens if at turn T, when I'm on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. Meaning, at position x=0 on that freeway, there is a car present.\n\nI need to be on y=9 at some turn, and y=9 is the goal, not a freeway with cars, so I don't have to worry about cars on y=9. The freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume.\n\ny=0 is the starting point or something, but in the player position, it's given as (0,y), so x=0 is the position we care about for collision.\n\nThe grid has vertical axis y=0 to 9, and we're always at x=0, I think, because the player is moving vertically, and cars are on horizontal freeways.\n\nPlayer moves vertically between y=0 and y=9, and at each turn, if on a freeway y=1 to 8, we check for collision at x=0 with cars on that freeway.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to see when there are cars at x=0.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: two cars: (h=54, τ=43, d=right, s=6) and (h=-12, τ=-23, d=right, s=6)\n\nSince both are right-moving, at time T, the position is shifted.\n\nFor first car: original head 54, tail 43 at t=17.\n\nAt time T, head = 54 + 6*(T-17)\n\nTail = 43 + 6*(T-17)\n\nSimilarly, second car: head = -12 + 6*(T-17)\n\nTail = -23 + 6*(T-17)\n\nNow, the car is present at x when tail <= x <= head, since right-moving, head > tail I assume.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I think.\n\nIn the car update: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSo for a car to be at x=0, we need τ + s(T-t1) <= 0 <= h + s(T-t1)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right-moving.\n\nSo for freeway k, there is a collision at time T if for any car on that freeway, τ + s(T-t1) <= 0 <= h + s(T-t1)\n\ns=6 for all, t1=17.\n\nSo let's define Δt = T - t1 = T - 17\n\nThen for a car, collision if τ + 6*Δt <= 0 <= h + 6*Δt\n\nWhich means:\n\nτ + 6*Δt <= 0 and 0 <= h + 6*Δt\n\nSo -h <= 6*Δt <= -τ\n\nSince τ and h could be negative or positive.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow for each freeway, let's find the times when there is a car at x=0, i.e., collision possible.\n\nFirst, freeway 1:\n\nCar 1: h=54, τ=43\n\nSo collision if 43 + 6*Δt <= 0 <= 54 + 6*Δt\n\nBut 54 + 6*Δt >=0 always since 6*Δt >=0 for T>=17, but 43 +6*Δt <=0? 43 +6*Δt <=0 implies Δt <= -43/6 ≈ -7.166, but Δt = T-17 >=0 since T>=17, so 43+6*Δt >0, thus 43+6*Δt <=0 is false for Δt>=0. Similarly, 0 <=54+6*Δt always true. But for the inequality to hold, we need both.\n\n43+6*Δt <=0 and 0<=54+6*Δt.\n\n0<=54+6*Δt is true for all Δt >=0 since 54>0.\n\nBut 43+6*Δt <=0? 43+6*Δt <=0 when Δt <= -43/6 ≈ -7.166, but Δt >=0, so never true. Therefore, for this car, there is never a collision at x=0 for T>=17.\n\nSimilarly, car 2: h=-12, τ=-23\n\nCollision if τ +6*Δt <=0 <= h +6*Δt\n\nSo -23 +6*Δt <=0 and 0<= -12 +6*Δt\n\nWhich is:\n\n-23 +6*Δt <=0 => 6*Δt <=23 => Δt <= 23/6 ≈ 3.833\n\nAnd 0<= -12 +6*Δt => 12 <=6*Δt => Δt >= 12/6 = 2\n\nSo for Δt between 2 and 3.833, inclusive? Since turns are integer, Δt integer.\n\nΔt = T-17, integer >=0.\n\nSo Δt >=2 and Δt <=3.833, so Δt=2 or 3.\n\nThus for freeway 1, collision at T=17+2=19 and T=17+3=20? Δt=2 and 3.\n\nT=17+2=19, Δt=2; T=20, Δt=3.\n\nNow for Δt=2: -23 +6*2 = -23+12= -11 <=0? -11 <=0 true, and 0 <= -12 +12 =0, 0<=0 true, so yes.\n\nFor Δt=3: -23+18= -5 <=0 true, 0 <= -12+18=6, 0<=6 true.\n\nFor Δt=4: -23+24=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, so not.\n\nΔt=1: -23+6= -17<=0 true, but 0<= -12+6= -6? 0<= -6 false, so not.\n\nSo only Δt=2 and 3, T=19 and 20.\n\nBut freeway 1 has two cars, but first car never causes collision, second car causes at T=19 and 20.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision at T=19 and T=20.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1? Look at the table.\n\nFreeway 2: same cars: (54,43,right,6) and (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nExactly the same as freeway 1.\n\nSo similarly, collision at T=19 and 20 only from second car.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same, (54,43,right,6) and (-12,-23,right,6), so same, collision at T=19,20.\n\nFreeway 4: same, collision at T=19,20.\n\nNow freeway 5: three cars: (54,43,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), and (12,1,right,6)\n\nFirst car: same as before, (54,43,right,6), which never causes collision for T>=17.\n\nSecond car: (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nh=-24? Tail τ=-35, head h=-24.\n\nFor right-moving, span at T: [τ +6*Δt, h +6*Δt] = [-35 +6*Δt, -24 +6*Δt]\n\nCollision if -35 +6*Δt <=0 and 0 <= -24 +6*Δt\n\nSo:\n\n-35 +6*Δt <=0 => 6*Δt <=35 => Δt <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833\n\nAnd 0 <= -24 +6*Δt => 24 <=6*Δt => Δt >= 24/6 =4\n\nSo Δt between 4 and 5.833, so Δt=4,5\n\nT=17+4=21, T=22? Δt=4,5\n\nThird car: (12,1,right,6) h=12, τ=1\n\nCollision if τ +6*Δt <=0 and 0<= h +6*Δt\n\n1 +6*Δt <=0? 1 +6*Δt <=0 => 6*Δt <= -1, impossible for Δt>=0\n\n0<=12 +6*Δt always true.\n\nBut 1+6*Δt <=0 false, so no collision for this car.\n\nSo for freeway 5, only second car causes collision at Δt=4 and 5, T=21 and 22.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5? Cars: (54,43,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), (12,1,right,6)\n\nSame as freeway 5, so collision at T=21 and 22 from second car.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: same cars, collision at T=21,22.\n\nFreeway 8: same, (54,43,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), (12,1,right,6), so collision at T=21,22.\n\nNow, to summarize the dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: dangerous at T=19,20\n\n- Freeway 2: same, T=19,20\n\n- Freeway 3: T=19,20\n\n- Freeway 4: T=19,20\n\n- Freeway 5: T=21,22\n\n- Freeway 6: T=21,22\n\n- Freeway 7: T=21,22\n\n- Freeway 8: T=21,22\n\nI need to go from y=5 at T=17 to y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe player can move up, down, or stay, changing y by +1, -1, or 0 per turn, within 0 to 9.\n\nI start at y=5 at t=17.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal turns would be if I go up every turn, but I have to avoid being on a freeway when it's dangerous for that y.\n\ny=1 to 8 are freeways.\n\nThe goal is y=9, which is not a freeway, so no car check.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=5 to y=9 in min turns, avoiding being on y=k when T is dangerous for that k.\n\nSince the dangerous times are the same for groups of freeways.\n\nSpecifically, freeways 1-4 have danger at T=19,20\n\nFreeways 5-8 have danger at T=21,22\n\ny=1,2,3,4 are dangerous at T=19,20\n\ny=5,6,7,8 are dangerous at T=21,22\n\nI start at y=5 at T=17.\n\nT=17: I'm at y=5.\n\nNow, at T=17, I can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go up, to y=6 at T=18? Let's see the timeline.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position y_T.\n\nI perform action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe collision is checked at turn T when I am on y_T, if y_T between 1 and 8, and if for that freeway, at that turn, there is a car at x=0.\n\nIn the note, it says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nBut for y_T, you are on it, so if dangerous, collide.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAt turn T, you are at y_T.\n\nYou choose action a_T, which affects y_{T+1}.\n\nBut during turn T, you are on y_T, so if y_T in 1-8, and there is a car on that freeway at x=0 at time T, collision.\n\nThen, after action, at T+1, you are at y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nThe collision only happens when you are on the freeway at that exact turn.\n\nNow, for the freeway you are leaving or entering, the note says that if you move, you are not on the new row until the next turn.\n\nSo for example, at turn T, on y_T, if you move to y_{T+1} different, at turn T you are still on y_T, not on y_{T+1}.\n\nSo collision only checked for y_T at time T.\n\nNow, back to the problem.\n\nI need to go from y=5 at T=17 to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since I need to go up 4 levels (5 to 6,6 to7,7 to8,8 to9), at least 4 turns if I go up each time.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down to avoid danger.\n\nFirst, let's see the danger times.\n\nDangerous freeways:\n\nFor y=1,2,3,4: dangerous at T=19,20\n\nFor y=5,6,7,8: dangerous at T=21,22\n\nAt T=17, I am at y=5.\n\ny=5 is dangerous at T=21 and 22, but not at T=17,18,19,20? Let's list for each y and time when dangerous.\n\ny=5: freeway 5, dangerous at T=21,22\n\nSimilarly y=6: freeway 6, dangerous at T=21,22\n\ny=7: T=21,22\n\ny=8: T=21,22\n\ny=1: freeway 1, dangerous at T=19,20\n\ny=2: T=19,20\n\ny=3: T=19,20\n\ny=4: T=19,20\n\nNow, times: T=17,18,19,20,21,22,...\n\nI start at T=17, y=5.\n\nT=17: y=5, not dangerous (since danger for y=5 is at 21,22)\n\nI can choose action.\n\nIf I go up, at T=18, I will be at y=6.\n\nT=18: y=6, is it dangerous? For y=6, danger at T=21,22, so at T=18, not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up again, T=19, y=7.\n\nT=19: y=7, danger? y=7 dangerous at T=21,22, not at 19. So safe.\n\nThen T=20, y=8, if I go up.\n\nT=20: y=8, danger at T=21,22, not at 20, so safe.\n\nThen at T=21, if I go up to y=9, but at T=21, I am at y=8, and I perform action to go to y=9.\n\nAt turn T=21, I am at y=8, which is dangerous at T=21? Yes, y=8 dangerous at T=21 and 22.\n\nAt T=21, if I am on y=8, and it is dangerous, I collide.\n\nThen, even if I move to y=9 at the same turn, but I am on y=8 during turn T=21, so I collide with cars on y=8 at that time.\n\nThe action happens after or during? But from the note, collision is based on being on y_T at time T.\n\nSo if I am on y=8 at T=21, and y=8 is dangerous at T=21, I collide, regardless of what action I take.\n\nThen, after collision, I don't care, but I need to avoid collision.\n\nSo in this sequence:\n\nT=17: start y=5, safe\n\nAction U: go to y=6 at T=18\n\nT=18: at y=6, safe (danger only 21,22)\n\nAction U: to y=7 at T=19\n\nT=19: at y=7, safe? y=7 dangerous at 21,22, not 19, so safe.\n\nAction U: to y=8 at T=20\n\nT=20: at y=8, dangerous? y=8 dangerous at 21,22, not at 20. At T=20, for freeway 8, is it dangerous?\n\nFreeway 8 dangerous at T=21,22, not at 20.\n\nSimilarly, at T=20, y=8 should be safe.\n\nThen action U: to y=9 at T=21\n\nBut at T=21, I am at y=8 when I start the turn, I perform action to go to y=9, but during turn T=21, I am on y=8, and since y=8 is dangerous at T=21, I collide.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=8 at T=21.\n\nSimilarly, if I am on y=8 at T=22, also collide.\n\nBut in this sequence, at T=21, I am on y=8 and it is dangerous.\n\nSo collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot reach y=9 by T=21 if I go directly up.\n\nI need to arrive at y=9 at some turn, say T=H, so at turn T=H-1, I am at y=8 or y=9? Let's think.\n\nI reach y=9 at turn T, meaning that after action at T-1, I am at y=9 at time T.\n\nThe position is y_t at turn t.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn T, it means that at turn T, y_T =9.\n\nWhich is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nTo get there, at turn T-1, I was at y_{T-1}, and I performed action that made y_T = y_{T-1} + Δy =9.\n\nSo y_{T-1} could be 8 or 9 or 10, but y=10 not possible, max 9, so y_{T-1} must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_{T-1} =9, and I stay or go down, but I need to reach 9, so if I am already at 9, I can stay.\n\nBut I start at 5, so I need to get to 9.\n\nMinimal, from 5 to 9, if I go up each time, I reach y=9 at T=17 +4 =21, so at turn 21, y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at T=21, I need to be at y=8 at T=20, and perform U.\n\nAt T=20, I am at y=8, and perform U to go to y=9 at T=21.\n\nNow, at T=20, I am on y=8. Is y=8 dangerous at T=20?\n\nAs above, for y=8, dangerous only at T=21,22, not at 20. So at T=20, y=8 is safe.\n\nThen I go to y=9 at T=21, which is safe.\n\nBut earlier I thought at T=21 I am on y=8, but no.\n\nAt turn T=20: I am at y=8, and since T=20, and danger for y=8 is at 21 and 22, not 20, so no collision.\n\nThen I perform action U, so at T=21, I am at y=9, which is not a freeway, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, at T=21, I am at y=9, no issue.\n\nBut what about previous turns?\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nT=17: y=5, safe\n\nAction U: to y=6 at T=18\n\nT=18: y=6, safe (danger 21,22)\n\nAction U: to y=7 at T=19\n\nT=19: y=7, safe (danger 21,22)\n\nAction U: to y=8 at T=20\n\nT=20: y=8, safe (danger only at 21,22, not 20)\n\nAction U: to y=9 at T=21\n\nT=21: y=9, safe.\n\nNow, is there any collision? At no point was I on a freeway at a dangerous time.\n\ny=5 at T=17: safe, not dangerous\n\ny=6 at T=18: safe\n\ny=7 at T=19: safe\n\ny=8 at T=20: safe\n\nThen y=9 at T=21.\n\nBut y=8 at T=20 is safe, as established.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut earlier I thought about being on y=8 at T=21, but in this case, at T=21 I am at y=9, not on y=8.\n\nThe dangerous time for y=8 is T=21 and 22, so at T=21, if I were on y=8, it would be dangerous, but I'm not, I'm at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, I am never on y=8 at T=21; at T=21 I am at y=9.\n\nAt T=20 I am on y=8, but T=20 is not dangerous for y=8.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the dangerous times.\n\nFor freeway 8, dangerous at T=21 and 22.\n\nAt T=20, what is the car position?\n\nFor freeway 8, cars: same as freeway 5, etc.\n\nSecond car: at T=20, Δt = T-17 = 3\n\nFor car (-24,-35,right,6), span at T: [-35 +6*3, -24 +6*3] = [-35+18, -24+18] = [-17,-6]\n\nx=0 not in [-17,-6], since -17 to -6, all negative, 0 not <= -6? -6 <0, so 0 not in interval.\n\nSimilarly, other cars not at 0.\n\nSo at T=20, no car at x=0 on freeway 8, so safe.\n\nAt T=21, Δt=4, [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], now 0 is included? 0 <= h +6*Δt = -24+24=0, so 0 <=0 true, and τ +6*Δt = -35+24= -11 <=0 true, so yes, car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly at T=22, etc.\n\nSo at T=20, no car, safe.\n\nIn the sequence, all safe.\n\nBut I start at T=17, y=5, and after 4 actions (U at 17,18,19,20), I reach y=9 at T=21.\n\nH is the number of turns? The sequence of actions from t=17 to t=17+H-1, so that at turn t=17+H-1, y=9.\n\nIn this case, actions at t=17,18,19,20: four actions, H=4 turns? Let's see.\n\nTurn t=17: action a_{17}, then at turn t=18, y_{18} depends on a_{17}, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=17+H, y_{17+H} is set.\n\nDefine.\n\nInitial: at turn t_1=17, position (0,y_{17}) with y_{17}=5.\n\nAfter action a_{17}, at turn 18, y_{18} = y_{17} + Δy from a_{17}.\n\nSimilarly, after a_{18}, at turn 19, y_{19}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{17+H}.\n\nWe want y_{17+H} =9 for some H.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so indices t=17 to 17+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 17+H, we are at y_{17+H}.\n\nWe want y_{17+H} =9.\n\nMinimal H such that we can achieve this without collision during the path.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nAt turn 17: y=5, perform a_{17}=U, so at turn 18, y=6\n\nTurn 18: y=6, perform a_{18}=U, to turn 19, y=7\n\nTurn 19: y=7, perform a_{19}=U, to turn 20, y=8\n\nTurn 20: y=8, perform a_{20}=U, to turn 21, y=9\n\nNow, at each turn, when we are on y_t, we check collision for that y at time t.\n\nTurn 17: y=5, time 17. For y=5, dangerous at t=21,22, not 17, safe.\n\nTurn 18: y=6, time 18, dangerous at 21,22, not 18, safe.\n\nTurn 19: y=7, time 19, dangerous at 21,22, not 19, safe.\n\nTurn 20: y=8, time 20, dangerous at 21,22, not 20, safe.\n\nThen at turn 21: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nAnd we reached y=9 at turn 21, with H=4 actions? Actions at t=17,18,19,20, so 4 actions.\n\nAfter 4 actions, at turn 17+4=21, y=9.\n\nH=4.\n\nBut is there a problem? In this case, no collision, and I reached in 4 turns.\n\nBut earlier I thought about danger at T=19,20 for lower freeways, but I was not on those freeways at those times.\n\nFor example, at T=19, I was on y=7, which is safe, not on y=1-4.\n\nSimilarly at T=20, on y=8, safe.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut can I reach faster? In 3 turns? From y=5 to y=9, I need to increase by 4, each action can increase by at most 1, so minimum 4 actions to go from 5 to 9.\n\nIf I go up each time, 4 actions.\n\nIf I go down or stay, it would take more turns.\n\nSo 4 is minimum possible.\n\nAnd in this case, it works.\n\nBut let me confirm if at turn 19, when I am on y=7, is there any issue?\n\ny=7, freeway 7, dangerous at T=21,22, not at 19.\n\nAt T=19, for freeway 7, Δt=19-17=2\n\nCars: for example, car (-24,-35,right,6), at T=19, Δt=2, span [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12], x=0 not in.\n\nOther cars not at 0.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo with 4 up actions, I can reach in 4 turns.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence of actions.\n\nt1=17.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 17: a_{17} = U\n\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U\n\nTurn 19: a_{19} = U\n\nTurn 20: a_{20} = U\n\nThen at turn 21, y=9.\n\nH=4.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so t=17 to 17+3=20? H=4, t from 17 to 17+4-1=20, actions at t=17,18,19,20.\n\nAfter that, at turn 21, position reached.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 5, there is a third car (12,1,right,6), but we saw it never causes collision, so fine.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut is there a reason I cannot do this?\n\nAnother thing: the player position at turn t is before action or after? I think I have it right.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case H=4.\n\nBut let me see if I can do in less, impossible.\n\nPerhaps I need to avoid being at certain positions.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 19, if I were on y=4, it would be dangerous, but I am not.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but no.\n\nMaybe I can reach at an earlier turn, but from y=5, earliest to y=9 is turn 21 with 4 up moves.\n\nTurn 17: start y=5\n\nAfter one up, turn 18: y=6\n\nAfter two, turn 19: y=7\n\nAfter three, turn 20: y=8\n\nAfter four, turn 21: y=9\n\nCannot be earlier.\n\nIf I start at turn 17 y=5, and I could be at y=9 at turn 17? No, impossible.\n\nMinimal H=4.\n\nAnd sequence works.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 5, there is a car (12,1,right,6), at T=17, where is it?\n\nBut not relevant.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if at some point I need to wait.\n\nBut in this case, no need.\n\nMaybe for y=5 at T=17, but it is safe.\n\nAnother thing: the initial position is given at turn t1=17, y=5.\n\nNow, I think it should be fine.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nIt says \"reach (0,9)\", and \"minimal number of turns H\"\n\nH is the number of actions, I think.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so t=0: a_{t1}, t=1: a_{t1+1}, ..., t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nThen after that, at turn t1 + H, position is reached.\n\nIn this case, t1=17, H=4, actions at t=17,18,19,20, to reach at t=21.\n\nBut the turn when position is reached is t=21.\n\nBut H is the number of turns? The sequence has H actions.\n\nPerhaps H is the number of turns taken, meaning from start to end.\n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nSo after H actions, we reach.\n\nIn terms of time, it takes H turns to perform the actions, and we reach at turn t1 + H.\n\nMinimal H is 4.\n\nAnd sequence: a17=U, a18=U, a19=U, a20=U.\n\nBut is there a problem with the cars at T=19 or 20?\n\nFor example, at T=19, freeways y=1,2,3,4 are dangerous, but I am on y=7, which is not dangerous at T=19.\n\nSimilarly, at T=20, y=1-4 dangerous? y=1-4 dangerous at T=19,20.\n\nAt T=20, y=1,2,3,4 dangerous.\n\nBut I am on y=8 at T=20, which is safe.\n\ny=8 not dangerous at T=20.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can consider going down to avoid, but no need, and it would take more turns.\n\nSo I think H=4 is achievable.\n\nBut let me see the car state again.\n\nIn freeway 5, there is a car (12,1,right,6), at T=17, span [1 +0,12+0]? At T=17, Δt=0, so span [1,12], not at 0.\n\nAt other times, not at 0, as we saw.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should list for each y and time if dangerous.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nAnother point: the player can go to y=0 or y=9, boundaries.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nIn this path, I don't go to y=0.\n\nSo I think the sequence is correct.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nSo for t1=17, actions:\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nAnd H=4.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be boxed.\n\nBut let me see if I can do with H=3, but impossible, since from 5 to 9, need +4, each move at most +1.\n\nIf I start higher, but I start at 5.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps by going down first, but that would make it longer.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=4, but at T=17, y=4 is freeway 4, dangerous at T=19,20, not at 17.\n\nBut if I go to y=4 at T=18, then at T=19, if on y=4, dangerous.\n\nBut in my case, I don't need to.\n\nSo minimal is 4.\n\nPerhaps to avoid future danger, but in this case, no issue.\n\nAnother thought: at T=21, if I were on y=8, dangerous, but in my sequence, I am not on y=8 at T=21.\n\nI arrive at y=9 at T=21.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbers.\n\nt1=17\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 17: action U\n\nThen at turn 18, y=6\n\nTurn 18: action U, to turn 19, y=7\n\nTurn 19: action U, to turn 20, y=8\n\nTurn 20: action U, to turn 21, y=9\n\nActions at t=17,18,19,20, so H=4.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, which is 17 to 20.\n\nIn the box:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 17: a_{17} = U  \nTurn 18: a_{18} = U  \nTurn 19: a_{19} = U  \nTurn 20: a_{20} = U  \n}\n\nBut in the format, it says \"a_{t}\" with the turn number.\n\nIn the text, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nIn this case, t1=17.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n\nBut the car state has multiple cars, but I think I covered.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car state.\n\nFor freeway 5, there is a car (12,1,right,6), which I thought no collision, but let me see at T=17, if I am on y=5, but at T=17, span [1,12], not 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think no issue.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 4, with all up actions.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 17\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis\n- The player starts at \\(y = 5\\) at turn 17.\n- The minimum vertical distance to cover is 4 units (from \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 9\\)), requiring at least 4 turns if moving up (U) each turn.\n- Collision occurs only if the player is on a freeway \\(y = k\\) (for \\(k = 1\\) to \\(8\\)) at a turn \\(T\\) where a car is present at \\(x = 0\\) on that freeway at time \\(T\\).\n- Dangerous times for each freeway (based on car positions and movements):\n  - Freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4\\): Dangerous at turns \\(T = 19\\) and \\(T = 20\\).\n  - Freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\): Dangerous at turns \\(T = 21\\) and \\(T = 22\\).\n- Positions \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) are safe (no cars).\n\n### Path to Reach \\(y = 9\\) in Minimal Turns\n- At turn 17: Player is at \\(y = 5\\). \\(y = 5\\) is dangerous only at \\(T = 21\\) and \\(22\\), so it is safe at \\(T = 17\\). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 18.\n- At turn 18: Player is at \\(y = 6\\). \\(y = 6\\) is dangerous only at \\(T = 21\\) and \\(22\\), so it is safe at \\(T = 18\\). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 19.\n- At turn 19: Player is at \\(y = 7\\). \\(y = 7\\) is dangerous only at \\(T = 21\\) and \\(22\\), so it is safe at \\(T = 19\\). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 20.\n- At turn 20: Player is at \\(y = 8\\). \\(y = 8\\) is dangerous only at \\(T = 21\\) and \\(22\\), so it is safe at \\(T = 20\\). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 21.\n- At turn 21: Player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is safe (not a freeway).\n\nThis sequence reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 21 after 4 actions, with no collisions. Since moving up each turn is the fastest way to cover the distance, \\(H = 4\\) is minimal.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t = 17\\) to \\(t = 20\\) (i.e., \\(t_1 + t\\) for \\(t = 0\\) to \\(H-1 = 3\\)) is:\n- Turn 17: \\(a_{17} = U\\)\n- Turn 18: \\(a_{18} = U\\)\n- Turn 19: \\(a_{19} = U\\)\n- Turn 20: \\(a_{20} = U\\)\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 17: a_{17} = U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: a_{18} = U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: a_{19} = U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: a_{20} = U }",

The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right with given speeds, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway at a turn when a car spans x=0 on that freeway. Importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I only check for collision on the freeway I'm currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car positions at any future turn based on the given state at t=18.\n\nThe car update rule: for a car, at turn T > t1, the span changes based on direction and speed.\n\nLeft-moving: span becomes [h - s(T - t1), τ - s(T - t1)]\n\nBut in the table, for left-moving, it might be head and tail, but here all cars seem to be right-moving, I think.\n\nLet's check the direction.\n\nIn the car state, for each freeway, the cars are listed with (h, τ, d, s)\n\nd is direction: for all cars, it says \"right\", so all cars are moving right.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (60,49,right,6) and (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nSince they're moving right, the span update should be: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]\n\nFrom the rule: right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd since d is right for all, that's fine.\n\nt1 = 18.\n\nAlso, for collision, it happens if at turn T, for the freeway y_T, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\ny_T is the player's y position at turn T, I think. At turn T, player is at (0, y_T), and we check if on freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nNow, the player position changes with actions.\n\nI start at turn 18, y=6.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince I'm at y=6, and I need to go to y=9, that's up 3, so minimum 3 turns if I can go straight up without issues.\n\nBut there might be cars on y=6,7,8 that I need to avoid when I'm on those rows.\n\nAlso, I can stay or move down to avoid, but since I need to go up, down might not help, but I might need to wait.\n\nFirst, let's find out for each freeway, when a car is at x=0.\n\nFor a given freeway k, and car, at turn T, the span is [τ + s(T-18), h + s(T-18)] for right-moving cars.\n\nThen 0 is in span if τ + s(T-18) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T-18)\n\nSince h and τ, for right-moving, I think head is the front, so if moving right, head should be on the right, so for right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume.\n\nIn the initial state, for example, freeway 1: (60,49,right,6)\n\n60 and 49, 60>49, so head=60, tail=49, so span [49,60] at t=18.\n\nSimilarly, (-6,-17,right,6), -6 > -17, so head=-6, tail=-17, span [-17,-6].\n\nNow, at time T, span becomes [τ + s(T-18), h + s(T-18)]\n\ns=6 for all, I think.\n\nLet me list all cars.\n\nFreeway 1: two cars: car1: h=60, τ=49, s=6, d=right\n\ncar2: h=-6, τ=-17, s=6, d=right\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2,3,4: same as freeway 1? No, let's see the table.\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\n| 1 | (60,49,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6) |\n\n| 2 | (60,49,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6) | same as 1\n\n| 3 | same\n\n| 4 | same\n\n| 5 | (60,49,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6), (18,7,right,6) |\n\n| 6 | same as 5\n\n| 7 | same as 5\n\n| 8 | same as 5\n\nFreeways 1-4 have two cars each, with the same parameters.\n\nFreeways 5-8 have three cars each, with different parameters.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when x=0 is covered by a car on that freeway.\n\nThat is, for a given k and T, if there exists a car on k such that 0 is in [τ + 6(T-18), h + 6(T-18)]\n\nSince s=6.\n\nSet Δt = T - 18, so at turn T = 18 + Δt.\n\nThen for a car, span: [τ + 6Δt, h + 6Δt]\n\n0 in span iff τ + 6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + 6Δt\n\nWhich is equivalent to: τ + 6Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + 6Δt\n\nOr, -h/6 ≤ Δt ≤ -τ/6\n\nSince τ and h are given, I can compute the time intervals when 0 is occupied for each car.\n\nFirst, let's handle freeways 1-4, since they are similar.\n\nFor freeway k=1 to 4:\n\nCar A: h=60, τ=49, s=6\n\nThen 0 in span iff 49 + 6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 60 + 6Δt\n\n49 + 6Δt ≤ 0 => 6Δt ≤ -49 => Δt ≤ -49/6 ≈ -8.166\n\n0 ≤ 60 + 6Δt => -60 ≤ 6Δt => Δt ≥ -10\n\nBut Δt is time from t=18, so T=18+Δt, Δt >=0 since T>=18, but for future, Δt >=0.\n\nIn the inequality, 49 + 6Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 60 + 6Δt\n\nFirst, 0 ≤ 60 + 6Δt is always true for Δt >=0 since 60+6Δt >=60>0.\n\n0 ≤ 60 + 6Δt => 6Δt >= -60, Δt >= -10, which is true for Δt>=0.\n\nSimilarly, 49 + 6Δt ≤ 0 => 6Δt <= -49, Δt <= -49/6 ≈ -8.166, but Δt >=0, so this is never true for Δt>=0.\n\nTherefore, for car A, since h=60>0 and τ=49>0, at Δt=0, span [49,60], all positive, and moving right, so for Δt>=0, the left end τ+6Δt =49+6Δt >=49>0, so 0 is never in the span for Δt>=0.\n\nSimilarly, car B: h=-6, τ=-17, s=6\n\n0 in span iff -17 + 6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -6 + 6Δt\n\nSo -17 + 6Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -6 + 6Δt\n\nFirst: -17 + 6Δt <= 0 => 6Δt <=17 => Δt <= 17/6 ≈ 2.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -6 + 6Δt => 6 <= 6Δt => Δt >=1\n\nSo for Δt >=1 and Δt <= 2.833, so Δt=1,2 since Δt integer.\n\nΔt = T-18, so T=19,20.\n\nFor Δt=1: T=19, -17+6= -11, -6+6=0, so span [-11,0], so 0 is included? 0 <= 0 is true, and -11 <=0 true, so yes.\n\nFor Δt=2: T=20, -17+12= -5, -6+12=6, span [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nFor Δt=3: T=21, -17+18=1, -6+18=12, span [1,12], 0 not <=1, so no.\n\nSo for car B, 0 occupied at T=19 and T=20.\n\nTherefore, for freeway 1, car B causes collision at T=19 and T=20.\n\nCar A is never at 0 for Δt>=0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision when player on y=1 at T=19 or T=20.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2,3,4: same cars, so same situation, collision at T=19 and T=20 if player on that freeway.\n\nNow freeways 5-8.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars.\n\nCar C: (60,49,right,6) same as before, never at 0 for Δt>=0.\n\nCar D: (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nCar E: (18,7,right,6)\n\nFirst, car C: h=60, τ=49, as before, 0 never in span for Δt>=0.\n\nCar D: h=-18, τ=-29, s=6\n\n0 in span iff -29 + 6Δt <= 0 <= -18 + 6Δt\n\nSo -29 + 6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=29 => Δt <= 29/6 ≈4.833\n\nAnd 0 <= -18 + 6Δt => 18 <= 6Δt => Δt >=3\n\nSo Δt >=3 and Δt <=4.833, so Δt=3,4, T=21,22\n\nFor Δt=3: T=21, span [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔt=4: T=22, [-29+24, -18+24] = [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔt=5: T=23, [-29+30, -18+30]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nCar E: h=18, τ=7, s=6\n\n0 in span iff 7 + 6Δt <= 0 <= 18 + 6Δt\n\nFirst, 7 + 6Δt <=0? 6Δt <= -7, Δt <= -7/6 ≈ -1.166, not possible for Δt>=0.\n\n0 <= 18 + 6Δt always true for Δt>=0.\n\nBut 7 + 6Δt <=0 not true, so 0 not <= left end? Left end is 7+6Δt >=7>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nτ=7>0, h=18>0, both positive, moving right, so left end min at Δt=0 is 7>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nTherefore for freeway 5, only car D causes collision at T=21 and T=22.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6,7,8: same, collision at T=21 and T=22.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway when collision occurs if player is on it:\n\n- Freeway 1: collision at T=19,20\n\n- Freeway 2: same, T=19,20\n\n- Freeway 3: same, T=19,20\n\n- Freeway 4: same, T=19,20\n\n- Freeway 5: collision at T=21,22\n\n- Freeway 6: same, T=21,22\n\n- Freeway 7: same, T=21,22\n\n- Freeway 8: same, T=21,22\n\nAnd for other times, no collision on that freeway.\n\nNow, player starts at turn 18, y=6.\n\nAt turn 18, player is at y=6, which is freeway 6? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=6 is freeway 6.\n\nAt turn 18, position is (0,6), so we need to check if at turn 18, on freeway 6, is there collision?\n\nAt turn 18, Δt=0, for freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 has cars: like freeway 5, car C, D, E.\n\nAt Δt=0, car C: [49,60], not 0\n\nCar D: τ=-29, h=-18, span [-29,-18], 0 not in\n\nCar E: [7,18], not 0\n\nSo no car at 0, so no collision at turn 18.\n\nNow, player needs to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is above freeway 8.\n\nNow, actions: each turn, I choose U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nI start at y=6 at t=18.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal turns: since I need to go up 3, I can do U,U,U in three turns, but need to avoid being on a freeway when it has a car at 0.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose action to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nBut when I am on y_T at turn T, I must not collide, meaning no car on freeway y_T has 0 in span at T.\n\nThen I move to y_{T+1}, and at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible to go directly.\n\nStart t=18, y=6.\n\nt=18: y=6, no collision, as above.\n\nNow, I can choose action for t=18, which affects y at t=19.\n\nLet me denote the turns.\n\nTurn T: position y_T, action a_T determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nAt each turn T, when I am at y_T, it must be safe, no collision on that freeway.\n\nThen I perform action to go to next y.\n\nAt turn T, I arrive at y_T at the beginning, I think, and then during the turn, I decide to move or stay, but the position update is after action.\n\nFrom the dynamics: at turn t, player is at (0, y_t), then we have collision check based on that, I think.\n\nThe collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in span for car on y_T at T.\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nThen after that, I choose action a_t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t, I am at y_t, then I choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nBut at turn t, when I am at y_t, we check collision.\n\nFor the action sequence, I need to specify a_t for t from t1 onwards.\n\nt1=18.\n\nSo at t=18, I am at y=6, which is safe.\n\nThen I choose a_{18}, which will set y_{19}.\n\nSimilarly, at t=19, I am at y_{19}, if it's a freeway, check collision, then choose a_{19}, and so on.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, no issue.\n\nMinimal H: starting from t=18, after H-1 actions, I am at turn t1 + H -1, and y=9.\n\nAfter k actions, I have moved k steps, but since actions include S, the number of turns may not directly give the y change.\n\nThe turn when I reach y=9 is t1 + H -1.\n\nLet me set T = t1 + t for t from 0 to H-1, but in the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1 for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of the turn number.\n\nList the turns starting from 18.\n\nTurn T | y_T | must be safe if y_T in 1-8\n\nAction a_T chosen at T affects y_{T+1}\n\nI start at T=18, y=6, safe.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nThe fastest way is to go up: U,U,U to reach y=9 at T=21.\n\ny_18 =6\n\nIf a_18 = U, then y_19 =7\n\nThen a_19 = U, y_20=8\n\nThen a_20 = U, y_21=9\n\nNow, check safety at each turn.\n\nAt T=18: y=6, safe, as before.\n\nT=19: y=7? y_19 depends on action.\n\nAt T=19, if y_19=7, need to check if freeway 7 has collision at T=19.\n\nFreeway 7: from above, for freeways 5-8, collision at T=21,22? Earlier.\n\nFreeway 7: same as 5, collision at T=21 and 22.\n\nT=19: Δt = T-18 =1\n\nFor freeway 7, at Δt=1, what is the situation?\n\nFreeway 7 has cars like freeway 5.\n\nCar C: (60,49,right,6) at Δt=1, span [49+6, 60+6] = [55,66], not 0.\n\nCar D: (-18,-29,right,6) at Δt=1, span [-29+6, -18+6] = [-23,-12], not 0.\n\nCar E: (18,7,right,6) at Δt=1, [7+6,18+6]=[13,24], not 0.\n\nSo at T=19, freeway 7 is safe, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, T=20: y_20=8, if we go there.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=20: Δt=2\n\nCar C: [49+12,60+12]=[61,72], no\n\nCar D: [-29+12, -18+12]=[-17,-6], now -17 <= -6, and 0? -17 <=0 <= -6? 0 <= -6 is false, -6 is negative, so 0 not in [-17,-6], since -6 <0.\n\n-17 <=0 is true, but 0 <= -6 is false, so 0 not in span.\n\nCar E: [7+12,18+12]=[19,30], no.\n\nSo freeway 8 safe at T=20.\n\nT=21: y_21=9, but y=9 is not a freeway, so no collision possible. We reach y=9.\n\nBut in the sequence above, to reach y=9 at T=21, we have:\n\nT=18: y=6, safe\n\na_18 = U, so y_19=7\n\nT=19: y=7, which is freeway 7, and at T=19, as above, safe.\n\nThen a_19 = U, y_20=8\n\nT=20: y=8, freeway 8, at T=20, safe as above.\n\nThen a_20 = U, y_21=9\n\nT=21: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nSo in three turns, I can reach: actions at t=18,19,20: U,U,U\n\nBut at T=21, I am at y=9, which is the goal.\n\nThe turn when I reach y=9 is T=21.\n\nNow, H: the sequence is from t=18 to t=18+H-1, with actions at each turn.\n\nI start at t=18, after 0 actions, at position.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, I am at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nt1=18, so at turn 18 + H -1, I should be at y=9.\n\nIn this case, with H-1=3 actions? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 18: after 0 actions, at y=6.\n\nAfter first action (at t=18), I go to y_19.\n\nAfter second action (at t=19), to y_20.\n\nAfter third action (at t=20), to y_21.\n\nAt turn 21, I am at y=9.\n\nSo I used actions at t=18,19,20, so 3 actions.\n\nH is the number of turns in the sequence? The sequence has actions from t=0 to H-1 relative, but in terms of turns, it's from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThe minimal H should be 3, since I need to go up 3 steps.\n\nAnd in this case, it seems possible, since at T=19 and T=20, for the rows I'm on, it's safe.\n\nT=19, I'm on y=7, which is freeway 7, and at T=19, no collision on freeway 7.\n\nSimilarly T=20, y=8, freeway 8, no collision at T=20.\n\nAnd T=21, y=9, safe.\n\nBut what about the collisions we have? For example, freeway 1 has collision at T=19,20, but I'm not on freeway 1, I'm on freeway 7 and 8, which are safe at those times.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 has collision at T=21,22, but at T=21, I'm on y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, with three actions: U,U,U at turns 18,19,20.\n\nBut let's confirm the times.\n\nTurn 18: at y=6, safe. Action U, so y_19=7\n\nTurn 19: at y=7, freeway 7, is it safe? As above, at T=19, Δt=1, freeway 7 cars: all spans away from 0, so safe. Action U, y_20=8\n\nTurn 20: at y=8, freeway 8, T=20, Δt=2, freeway 8 cars: car D span [-17,-6], 0 not in, etc., safe. Action U, y_21=9\n\nTurn 21: at y=9, not freeway, done.\n\nSo H=3, actions at t=18,19,20: U,U,U\n\nBut the sequence should be from t=18 to t=18+H-1, with H-1 actions? Let's see the answer format.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1}\n\n...\n\nUp to the last action before reaching.\n\nIn this case, with H=3, I have actions at t=18,19,20, so three actions, and I reach at t=21.\n\nThe turn when I reach is t=21 = t1 + 3, since t1=18, 18+3=21.\n\nH is such that t1 + H -1 =21, so 18 + H -1 =21, thus H-1=3, H=4?\n\nI think I'm confusing the indexing.\n\nLet me read the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"reach at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nSo, after H-1 actions, I am at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, I start at turn t1=18.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn 18, position (0,6)\n\nAfter 1 action (a_{t1} = a_18), at turn 19, position y_19\n\nAfter 2 actions (a_18 and a_19), at turn 20, y_20\n\nAfter 3 actions (a_18 to a_20), at turn 21, y_21=9\n\nSo at turn t1 + H -1 = 18 + H -1, with y=9.\n\nHere, 18 + H -1 = 21, so H-1=3, thus H=4.\n\nAnd the sequence has H actions: from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, so a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0, a_{18}, t=1, a_{19}, t=2, a_{20}.\n\nActions: a_18, a_19, a_20: all U.\n\nBut in the sequence, I need to output for each turn.\n\nIn the path, with H=4, meaning 4 turns in the sequence? But I have actions at three turns: 18,19,20.\n\nThe sequence has H elements: actions at t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1 to t1+H-1, that's H actions.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions at t1 only, then at turn t1, I do action, and after that, at turn t1+1, I am at new position, but to reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nIf H=1, then turn t1 +1 -1 = t1, so I must be at (0,9) at turn t1, but I start at (0,6), so impossible.\n\nMinimal H: since I start at y=6, need to reach y=9, at least 3 steps up, so minimal actions needed: at least 3 U actions, so at least 3 actions, so H at least 4? Let's see.\n\nAfter k actions, I can be at y from 6-k to 6+k, but to reach 9, I need at least 3 U actions, and no D or S to not go down, but I can have S, but S doesn't help to go up, so minimal actions to reach y=9 is 3, all U.\n\nThen after 3 actions, at turn t1 +3, y=9.\n\nt1 + H -1 = t1 +3, so H-1=3, H=4.\n\nAnd sequence: a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1} = a_{18} to a_{20}.\n\nWith all U.\n\nIn this case, as above, it seems safe.\n\nBut is there any issue at the turns?\n\nAt turn 19, when I am at y=7, freeway 7, is it safe? Yes.\n\nBut freeway 7 has collision at T=21 and 22, but T=19 is not 21 or 22.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nPerhaps I should check if I need to be on other rows.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, for example, from y=6 to y=7 at turn 18, action U.\n\nAt turn 18, I am on y=6, which is freeway 6.\n\nAt T=18, freeway 6: cars, at Δt=0, as before, no car at 0, safe.\n\nThen I move to y=7 at turn 19.\n\nAt turn 19, I am on y=7, freeway 7, at T=19, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, move to y=8 at turn 20, on freeway 8 at T=20, safe.\n\nThen to y=9.\n\nBut is there a problem with the cars on the rows I cross?\n\nThe note says: if I move to a new y at turn T, I am not on that new y until turn T+1, so at turn T, I am still on the old y.\n\nSo when I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I am on y, and after action, at turn T+1 I am on y+1.\n\nSo in this case, no issue with intermediate positions.\n\nFor example, when I go from y=6 to y=7 at turn 18, at turn 18 I am on y=6, and cars on y=6 at T=18 are fine.\n\nAt turn 19, I am on y=7, cars on y=7 at T=19 are fine.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should work.\n\nBut let's confirm for freeway 7 at T=19.\n\nFreeway 7: cars at T=19 (Δt=1)\n\nCar C: [49+6,60+6]=[55,66], not 0\n\nCar D: [-29+6,-18+6]=[-23,-12], not 0\n\nCar E: [7+6,18+6]=[13,24], not 0. All away from 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 at T=20 (Δt=2)\n\nCar C: [49+12,60+12]=[61,72]\n\nCar D: [-29+12,-18+12]=[-17,-6], -17 to -6, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nCar E: [7+12,18+12]=[19,30]\n\nAll good.\n\nAt T=21, if I were on freeway 7, it would be dangerous, but I'm not.\n\nSo, with H=4, actions: a_{18} = U, a_{19} = U, a_{20} = U\n\nBut the sequence should be from t=0 to H-1 relative, so:\n\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U\n\nTurn 19: a_{19} = U\n\nTurn 20: a_{20} = U\n\nAnd I reach at turn 21.\n\nBut H=4, and actions at t=18,19,20, which is three actions, but H includes the starting turn? No.\n\nt1 + H -1 =21, t1=18, so 18 + H -1 =21, H-1=3, H=4.\n\nThe sequence has H actions: from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1+0} to a_{t1+H-1}, so a_{18} to a_{20} for H=4, since t1+H-1=18+4-1=21, but a_{21} is not used because at turn 21, I am already at y=9, no action needed or something.\n\nThe action sequence is up to the point before reaching.\n\nIn this case, with actions at 18,19,20, I reach at 21.\n\nIf I do nothing, I stay, but I need to reach.\n\nSo minimal H is 4.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer? H=3: then t1 + H -1 =18+3-1=20, so must be at y=9 at turn 20.\n\nBut at turn 20, to be at y=9, I need to have moved up 3 times by turn 20.\n\nFrom turn 18 to turn 20, that's two actions: actions at turn 18 and 19.\n\nAfter action at turn 18, y_19\n\nAfter action at turn 19, y_20\n\nTo have y_20=9, since y_18=6, I need y_19=8 or 9, but if y_19=8, then a_19=U to y_20=9; or y_19=9, then a_19=S or something, but y_19=9 requires moving up from 6 in one action, impossible, since max +1 per action.\n\nSo possible: a_18=U, y_19=7; then a_19=U, y_20=8, not 9.\n\nOr a_18=U, y_19=7; a_19=U, y_20=8.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 20, I need y_20=9, which requires y_19=8 or 9, but y_19=9 impossible from y_18=6 in one action, or y_19=8, then a_19=U to y_20=9.\n\nBut y_19=8 requires from y_18=6, in one action, impossible.\n\nSo I cannot reach y=9 by turn 20; earliest turn 21 with three up actions.\n\nThus minimal H=4, with actions at 18,19,20 all U.\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=4, actions at t=18,19,20.\n\nBut let's list the turns.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if at some point I need to avoid, but in this case, it seems fine.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 20, when I am on y=8, freeway 8, at T=20, it is safe, as above.\n\nBut freeway 8 has collision at T=21 and 22.\n\nAt T=21, if I were still on y=8, it would be bad, but I move to y=9 at that turn.\n\nAt turn 20, I am on y=8, safe, then I do U, so at turn 21, I am on y=9.\n\nAt turn 21, I am not on freeway 8, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nPerhaps I should check if during the move, but the collision is only checked at the position at the start of the turn.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 4, with actions U,U,U at turns 18,19,20.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nFirst, H=4.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U\n\nTurn 19: a_{19} = U\n\nTurn 20: a_{20} = U\n\nIn the format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nt_1=18.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U\n\nTurn 19: a_{19} = U\n\nTurn 20: a_{20} = U\n\nBut for H=4, the sequence has three actions? No, H is the number of turns in the sequence, but the sequence has H actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn the sequence {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for H=4, t from 0 to 3? t=0,1,2,3? But that would be actions at t1, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3.\n\nBut in my case, I have actions only at t1, t1+1, t1+2.\n\nt1=18, actions at 18,19,20, which is t=0,1,2 relative to t1.\n\nt from 0 to 2, that's 3 actions, so H-1=3, H=4.\n\nThe sequence is for t=0 to H-1, so for H=4, t=0,1,2,3, but I don't have t=3, action at t1+3=21.\n\nI don't need action at turn 21 because I am already at y=9.\n\nThe sequence ends when I reach, so the last action is the one that brings me to the position.\n\nIn this case, with actions at t=18,19,20, I reach at t=21.\n\nSo the sequence has actions from t=18 to t=20, three actions, so H=4 means the sequence has 4 actions? I think I'm messing up.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nSo the sequence has H actions: at turns t1 + 0 to t1 + H-1.\n\nThen after these H actions, at turn t1 + H -1, I am at (0,9).\n\nIn this case, to be at (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nI start at turn t1, position (0,6).\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t1 + H -1? After k actions, I am at turn t1 + k.\n\nFor example, after 0 actions, at turn t1, position initial.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn t1 +1, position y_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}\n\nBut we want to reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter m actions, I am at turn t1 + m.\n\nSet turn t1 + m = t1 + H -1, so m = H-1.\n\nThus after H-1 actions, at turn t1 + (H-1) = t1 + H -1, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn this case, with m=H-1 actions, I reach at turn t1 + m.\n\nFor example, with 3 actions, at turn t1 +3, position y=9.\n\nt1 + H -1 = t1 +3, so H-1=3, H=4.\n\nAnd the sequence has H actions: from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}.\n\nFor H=4, a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, a_{t1+2}, a_{t1+3}\n\nBut with 4 actions, at turn t1+4, I would be at y=9, but turn t1 + H -1 = t1 +4-1=t1+3.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t1 + k.\n\nWe want position at turn t1 + H -1 to be (0,9).\n\nSo at turn t1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nAfter how many actions? At turn t, position y_t is set by the previous actions.\n\nAt turn t1, position is given, no action yet.\n\nAfter first action (at t1), position at t1+1 is set.\n\nAfter second action (at t1+1), position at t1+2, and so on.\n\nTo have position at turn T be (0,9), we need to have performed actions up to T-1 or something.\n\nLet T_reach = t1 + H -1\n\nAt turn T_reach, y_{T_reach} =9.\n\nThe actions that affect this are a_{t1} to a_{T_reach -1}, because a_{t1} sets y_{t1+1}, ..., a_{T_reach-1} sets y_{T_reach}.\n\nFor example, to have y_{21} =9, it is set by a_{20}, since y_{21} = y_{20} + Δy_{20}, based on a_{20}.\n\nSimilarly, y_{20} is set by a_{19}, and so on.\n\nIn general, y_{T} is determined by a_{T-1}, for T > t1.\n\nFor T = t1, y_{t1} is given.\n\nSo to have y_{T} =9 for some T, we need to choose actions from a_{t1} to a_{T-1} such that y_{T} =9.\n\nAnd T = t1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, for T=21, y_{21}=9, which is set by a_{20}, so we need a_{20} such that y_{21} = y_{20} + something =9, so if y_{20}=8, a_{20}=U.\n\ny_{20} itself is set by previous.\n\nWith T=21, t1=18, so H-1 = T - t1 = 21 - 18 =3, so H=4.\n\nAnd actions needed: a_{t1} to a_{T-1} = a_{18} to a_{20}, three actions.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} has H elements.\n\nFor H=4, t from 0 to 3, so a_{18+0}, a_{19}, a_{20}, a_{21}.\n\nBut a_{21} would set y_{22}, which is after we reached.\n\nFor reaching at T=21, we don't need a_{21}, since at turn 21, we are already there.\n\nThe sequence should include only the actions up to the one that sets the position to 9.\n\nIn the sequence definition, {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach at t1+H-1, so for H=4, it includes a_{18} to a_{21}, but a_{21} is not necessary.\n\nPerhaps for the turn when we reach, no action is taken, or something.\n\nI think there's a confusion.\n\nIn the action sequence, a_t for t from t1 to t1+H-1, with H actions, and at turn t1 + H -1, we reach.\n\nFor example, if I start at t1, and I do nothing, but I need to move, but in this case.\n\nSuppose I want to reach at turn t1, but y=6, not 9, impossible.\n\nReach at turn t1+1: y_{t1+1} must be 9. But y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy based on a_{t1}. y_{t1}=6, so if a_{t1}=U, y_{t1+1}=7, not 9. Cannot reach in one step.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t1+2: y_{t1+2} must be 9. y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy based on a_{t1+1}. y_{t1+1} depends on a_{t1}.\n\nIf a_{t1}=U, y_{19}=7, then a_{t1+1}=a_{19}, if U, y_{20}=8, not 9. If a_{t1}=U, y_{19}=7, a_{19}=U, y_{20}=8, then to have y_{20}=9, impossible.\n\ny_{t1+2} = y_{20}, which can be at most 8 if from 6 with two U.\n\nCannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t1+3=21, y_{21} can be 9 with three U actions.\n\nSo earliest at turn 21.\n\nThus T_reach =21.\n\nThen t1 + H -1 =21, 18 + H -1 =21, H-1=3, H=4.\n\nAnd the sequence has H=4 actions: a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to 3, that is a_{18}, a_{19}, a_{20}, a_{21}.\n\nBut a_{21} sets y_{22}, which is not needed, and we can set a_{21} to S or something, but since we already reached at turn 21, it might be redundant.\n\nIn the context, probably, after reaching, no need for action, but the sequence includes actions until the reach turn or something.\n\nTo avoid confusion, in this case, for the path to reach at turn 21, we need actions at turn 18,19,20 to set y_{19},y_{20},y_{21}.\n\na_{18} sets y_{19}, a_{19} sets y_{20}, a_{20} sets y_{21}.\n\nSo actions at 18,19,20.\n\nThen at turn 21, we are at y=9.\n\nNow, for the sequence, with H=4, it should include a_{18}, a_{19}, a_{20}, and a_{21}, but a_{21} is not used, and we can set it to S, but it doesn't matter.\n\nIn the output, we need to specify the actions until we reach.\n\nPerhaps for the last turn, when we reach, we don't need an action, but the sequence includes actions from t1 to the turn before reach.\n\nI think in the format, for H=4, it expects four actions, but in this case, with three actions we reach, so H should be such that t1+H-1 is the reach turn.\n\nI think I should look for the value.\n\nSince with three actions we reach at turn 21, and t1+H-1=21, H-1=3, H=4, and the sequence has four elements, but the last one might be for after reaching, but it's fine to set it to S or U, but since we are at 9, if we do U, y=10 invalid, so we must do S or D, but D not good, so S.\n\nBut in the minimal path, we can stop after reaching.\n\nTo be precise, in the sequence, for turns from t1 to t1+H-1, with H actions.\n\nFor the case where we reach at turn T, we need actions from t1 to T-1.\n\nNumber of actions: from t1 to T-1, that's (T-1) - t1 +1 = T - t1 actions.\n\nThen at turn T, we are at position.\n\nThen T = t1 + H -1, so number of actions = (t1 + H -1) - t1 = H-1.\n\nAnd the sequence has H actions? Contradiction.\n\nI think I should accept that for H=4, we have actions at 18,19,20,21 but a_{21} is not necessary, but for the sequence, we can put a_{21}=S.\n\nBut in this case, since at turn 21 we are at y=9, if we do S, we stay, fine.\n\nIf we do U, y=10, invalid, so we must not do U at y=9.\n\nSimilarly, D to 8, not good.\n\nSo if we include a_{21}, it should be S.\n\nBut in the minimal sequence, we can have only three actions.\n\nBut according to the definition, the sequence has H actions for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nPerhaps for this problem, since we reach at t1+H-1, and the actions up to a_{t1+H-2} set y_{t1+H-1}, and a_{t1+H-1} sets y_{t1+H}, which is after, so we don't care.\n\nBut we need to output the actions.\n\nTo be safe, in the output, for H=4, I will include a_{18}, a_{19}, a_{20}, a_{21} with a_{21}=S.\n\nBut that adds an extra turn.\n\nSince at turn 21, we are at y=9, and we can stop, but the sequence might include it.\n\nI think it's better to follow the definition.\n\nIn this case, with three actions U,U,U at 18,19,20, we reach at 21, so for the sequence, H=4, actions at 18,19,20,21 with a_{21} arbitrary, but to be valid, set to S.\n\nBut let's see if there is a shorter way, but there isn't.\n\nAnother thing: in the car states, for freeway 5-8, at T=21, there is collision, but I'm not on those rows.\n\nBut at T=21, if I were on y=5 to 8, it would be bad for 5-8, but I'm on y=9.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster, but impossible.\n\nOr with waiting, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nSo minimal H is 4.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to output.\n\nBut in the sequence, with all U, it works.\n\nBut let's make sure that at no point I am on a dangerous freeway.\n\nFor example, at turn 19, y=7, freeway 7, safe.\n\nBut freeway 7 has cars, but at T=19, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 20, y=8, freeway 8, safe.\n\nBut freeway 8 at T=20: car D span [-17,-6], which includes negative, but 0 not in, since -6 <0.\n\n-17 <=0 is true, but 0 <= -6 is false, so 0 not in [-17,-6].\n\nSimilarly, other cars not at 0.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the action sequence is U, U, U for turns 18,19,20.\n\nFor H=4, I need to include turn 21 action.\n\nSet a_{21} = S.\n\nBut since at turn 21 we are at y=9, S is fine.\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U\n\nTurn 19: a_{19} = U\n\nTurn 20: a_{20} = U\n\nTurn 21: a_{21} = S\n\nBut turn 21 is t1 + 3, and H=4, t from 0 to 3.\n\nAnd at turn t1 + H -1 = 18+4-1=21, we are at (0,9), which is correct.\n\nWith a_{21}=S, we stay at 9.\n\nIf I don't include a_{21}, but according to the sequence, it should be included.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nTo have minimal turns, but H includes the actions until the reach turn.\n\nAnother way: suppose I do U at 18, U at 19, U at 20, and at turn 21 I am at 9, no action needed, but the sequence might not include turn 21 action.\n\nBut in the definition, the sequence {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} up to H-1, and reach at t1+H-1.\n\nFor t1+H-1=21, H=4, t from 0 to 3, actions at 18,19,20,21.\n\nSo I need to specify a_{21}.\n\nSince y_{21}=9, a_{21} can be S to stay, or even U but y=10 invalid, so must not U, so S or D, but D to 8 not good, so S is fine.\n\nSo set a_{21}=S.\n\nBut in terms of minimal H, it's still 4, and we have the actions.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at turn 20, but impossible.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nBut for turn 21, action S, but at turn 21, after action, y_{22}=9 if S, but we are already at 9 at turn 21.\n\nI think it's redundant but necessary for the format.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 3, with reach at turn 20, but impossible.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think H=4 with four actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, the actions are to move, and the last action might be after reaching.\n\nI think I should proceed.\n\nSo for the answer.\n\nBut in the problem, it says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nWith actions, we can define a_{t1 + H-1}, but it sets y_{t1 + H}, which is not the reach turn.\n\nFor example, a_{t1 + H-1} sets y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo to have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, it must be set by a_{t1 + H -2}, for H-1 >0.\n\nSo the action a_{t1 + H-1} is not used for reaching, but for the next position.\n\nTherefore, in the sequence, a_{t1 + H-1} can be anything, but to keep it valid, set to S.\n\nIn this case, for reaching at turn 21, we need y_{21}=9, set by a_{20}.\n\nThen a_{21} sets y_{22}, which can be 9 with S.\n\nSo in sequence, for H=4, actions at t=18,19,20,21: a_{18}=U, a_{19}=U, a_{20}=U, a_{21}=S.\n\nYes.\n\nTo have only three actions, but H would be different.\n\nI think it's consistent.\n\nSo for this, with all U and last S.\n\nBut in this path, it works.\n\nBut earlier I thought about the cars, but for freeway 6 at turn 18, safe.\n\nBut freeway 6 has collision at T=21,22, but at T=18, not.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to avoid other times, but not necessary.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n\nTherefore, H=4, actions: U, U, U, S for turns 18,19,20,21.\n\nNow, in the output format.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{4}  % but H is the number, but in the box, it should be the sequence.\n\nThe answer format is the sequence, not H separately.\n\n\"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} ... }\"\n\nAnd H is determined.\n\nSo I need to output the actions.\n\nFor turns from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nWith H=4, turns 18,19,20,21.\n\nActions: U, U, U, S\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U\n\nTurn 19: a_{19} = U\n\nTurn 20: a_{20} = U\n\nTurn 21: a_{21} = S\n\nAnd I reach at turn 21.\n\nYes.\n\nTo make it without

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,7) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁=19, and I start at y=7. The goal is y=9.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. All cars are moving right with speed 6. That means for each turn after t₁, the car positions shift to the right by 6 units per turn.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t₁=19. For example, on freeway 1, there are two cars: one from -48 to -59? That doesn't make sense because tail should be less than head if it's right-moving. Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span is [h, τ] with h and τ, and it moves left, but all these are right-moving, I think. Look: in the car state, it says direction \"right\" for all.\n\nBut in the span, for right-moving, it says: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\"\n\nIn the table, for each car, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed). But for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, I assume.\n\nLook at freeway 1: \"(-48, -59, right, 6)\" — if it's right-moving, and head is -48, tail is -59, that would mean head > tail since -48 > -59, so the car is from -59 to -48, I think? But the notation says (head h, tail τ), and for right-moving, the span is [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nIn the car update: for right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h] and it moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nIn the table, it's given as (h, τ, d, s), so for the first car on freeway 1: h = -48, τ = -59, d = right, s=6.\n\nSince it's right-moving, the span at t₁ is [τ, h] = [-59, -48], because τ should be the left end, h the right end.\n\nSimilarly, the second car: (0, -11, right, 6), so span at t₁ is [-11, 0].\n\n-11 to 0.\n\nAnd it moves right with speed 6, so after Δt turns, positions increase by 6Δt.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nNow, freeways 1 to 4 have two cars each: one from [-59,-48] at t₁, and one from [-11,0] at t₁.\n\nFreeways 5 to 8 have three cars: [-59,-48], [-23,-12]? Let's see: (-12, -23, right, 6) — h=-12, τ=-23, so span [τ,h] = [-23,-12].\n\nAnd (24,13, right,6) — h=24, τ=13? τ=13, h=24, so [13,24].\n\nBut in the list, it's (head, tail), so for (24,13), if head is 24, tail is 13, that would be from 13 to 24 if right-moving.\n\nBut 13 to 24, that's fine.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T at that turn, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe player is at x=0 always, I think, since it's (0, y_t), so we care about whether x=0 is occupied by a car on the current freeway.\n\nSpecifically, at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, and there is a car on freeway y_T such that 0 is within its span at turn T.\n\nNow, the note says: when you move to a new y, at the turn you move, you are not on the new freeway yet. So if at turn T, you are on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1}, then at turn T, you are only on y_T for collision, and at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nSimilarly, if you stay, you are on the same.\n\nThe player position update: at turn t, position is (0, y_t), and after action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn based on y_t and the car spans at that turn.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=7 to y=9, starting turn t₁=19.\n\ny=7 is freeway 7, I assume freeway k is y=k.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, and player y from 0 to 9, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and y=0 is start or something, but here we start at y=7.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to be at (0,9) at some turn, and since it's the position at turn t, when y_t=9, I have reached.\n\nBut y_t=9 must be achieved, and at that turn, since y=9 has no cars, no collision.\n\nBut during the path, when on y=1 to 8, I need to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, minimal turns: since I need to go from 7 to 9, the minimum possible is 2 turns: up twice, but I need to check if I can do it without colliding.\n\nFirst, let's see the car positions at relevant freeways.\n\nI start at y=7 at turn t=19.\n\nFreeway 7 has cars: let's list all cars on freeway 7 at t=19.\n\nFrom table: freeway 7 has three cars: (-48,-59,right,6), so span [-59,-48] at t=19\n\n(-12,-23,right,6), span [-23,-12] at t=19\n\n(24,13,right,6) — (head=24, tail=13), so span [13,24] at t=19\n\nAll moving right at speed 6.\n\nNow, at turn 19, player at y=7.\n\nIf I take action at turn 19 to go up to y=8, or down to y=6, or stay at y=7.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9, so probably up is better.\n\nFirst, check if I can go up directly.\n\nAt turn 19, I am on y=7. Is there a collision? Collision if 0 in some car span on freeway 7 at turn 19.\n\nSpans: [-59,-48], [-23,-12], [13,24]. 0 is not in any of these, so no collision at turn 19.\n\nNow, after action, I can choose U, D, or S.\n\nIf I choose U at turn 19, then y_{20} = 7 +1 =8.\n\nAt turn 20, I am on y=8.\n\nNow, check collision at turn 20 on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 cars at t=19: same as 7, since table shows same for 5-8.\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,6) span [-59,-48]\n\n(-12,-23,right,6) span [-23,-12]\n\n(24,13,right,6) span [13,24]\n\nAt turn 20, which is T=20, ΔT = T - t₁ = 20 - 19 =1.\n\nSo car positions: each span moves right by 6*1 =6.\n\nSo for freeway 8 at turn 20:\n\nFirst car: [-59 +6, -48 +6] = [-53, -42]\n\nSecond car: [-23 +6, -12 +6] = [-17, -6]\n\nThird car: [13+6, 24+6] = [19,30]\n\nNow, is 0 in any span? [-53,-42] no, [-17,-6] -6 to -17? -17 to -6, which is -17 to -6, so from -17 to -6, 0 is not in this, since -6 <0? -6 is less than 0, but -6 to -17? Span is [left, right], so [-17, -6], so min -17, max -6, so numbers from -17 to -6, all negative, 0 not in.\n\n[19,30] all positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo no collision at turn 20 on y=8.\n\nThen, at turn 20, I can take action to go up to y=9.\n\nIf I take U at turn 20, y_{21} = 8 +1 =9.\n\nAt turn 21, I am on y=9, which is safe, goal reached.\n\nBut is that correct? At turn 21, position (0,9), so I reached at turn 21.\n\nBut I started at turn 19 at y=7, after two actions: U at t19, U at t20, to y9 at t21.\n\nH is the number of turns from t1, so from t19 to t21, that's two turns? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t, we perform action a_t, then position updates to y_{t+1}.\n\nStart: turn t1=19, position y_{19} =7.\n\nAfter action a_{19}, y_{20} is set.\n\nThen at turn 20, position y_{20}, after action a_{20}, y_{21} set, and so on.\n\nI reach y=9 when y_t =9 for some t.\n\nIn this case, if I do a_{19} = U, then y_{20} =8.\n\nThen a_{20} = U, y_{21} =9.\n\nSo at turn 21, y_{21}=9, I have reached.\n\nThe number of actions: from t=19 to t=20 and t=20 to t=21, so two actions, H=2 turns? But H is the minimal number of turns, and the sequence has H actions.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, based on a_t.\n\nSo from y_t to y_{t+1} in one step.\n\nTo go from y_{19}=7 to y_{21}=9, that takes two steps: t=19 to t=20, and t=20 to t=21.\n\nSo H=2, with actions at t=19 and t=20.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be actions starting from t1.\n\nNow, but I need to confirm if at turn 20, when I am on y=8, is it safe? I think I did.\n\nAt turn 20, on y=8, spans: [-53,-42], [-17,-6], [19,30], 0 not in any, yes.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 19, on y=7, safe.\n\nBut freeway 7 at turn 19 has [13,24], etc., 0 not in.\n\nBut let me check freeway 8 at turn 20: spans moved by +6, [-53,-42], [-17,-6], [19,30], all not containing 0.\n\n[-17,-6] is from -17 to -6, so x from -17 to -6, all x <= -6 <0, so 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nNow, but I need to go to y=9, which is safe.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nThe car on freeway 8 at turn 20 has a car from -17 to -6, which is close to zero but not including.\n\nSimilarly, at other times.\n\nBut I only need two turns: U at t19 and U at t20.\n\nBut let me check if at turn 19, if I stay or something, but why? I can go up directly.\n\nBut perhaps on other freeways, but I don't need to go to other freeways.\n\nI start at y=7, go to y=8 at t20, then to y=9 at t21.\n\nBut at turn 20, when I am on y=8, and the cars on y=8 are at positions, but 0 is not occupied.\n\nBut let me double-check the car spans.\n\nAnother thing: the car with (0,-11) on freeways 1-4.\n\nBut I am on y=7 and 8, so freeways 7 and 8.\n\nFreeways 1-4 have different cars? No, from table:\n\nFreeway 1: cars (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nSimilarly freeway 2,3,4 same.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8: (-48,-59,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6)\n\nFor freeway 7 and 8, at turn 19, the cars are: one from -59 to -48, one from -23 to -12, one from 13 to 24.\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nAt turn 20, for freeway 8: as I said, -59+6=-53, -48+6=-42, so [-53,-42]\n\n-23+6=-17, -12+6=-6, so [-17,-6]\n\n13+6=19, 24+6=30, [19,30]\n\n0 not in [-53,-42], not in [-17,-6] (since -6 <0), not in [19,30]>0.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 7 at turn 19: same as above, 0 not in.\n\nBut I was on freeway 7 at turn 19, no issue.\n\nThen to y=8 at turn 20.\n\nNow, if I go up at turn 20 to y=9.\n\nBut y=9 has no cars, so at turn 21, on y=9, safe.\n\nSo H=2 should be possible.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which I do at turn 21.\n\nBut let me see if there is a reason I cannot.\n\nPerhaps the cars on freeway 8 at turn 20, the [-17,-6] is close, but since -6 <0, and car ends at -6, so at x=-6, which is not 0, so 0 is not occupied.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let me think about the collision definition.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\"\n\nSpan(T) is the set of positions occupied by the car at turn T.\n\nFor the car from -17 to -6 at turn 20 on y=8, it occupies x from -17 to -6 inclusive, I assume, since span is [left, right] or what?\n\nIn the update, it says \"span\", and for collision, 0 in span, so if the span includes integers from left to right.\n\nBut in this case, from min to max, so for [-17,-6], it includes x=-17,-16,...,-6, all less than or equal to -6 <0, so 0 not included.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, with two actions: U at t19 and U at t20, I reach y=9 at t21.\n\nBut t21 is turn t1 + 2, since t1=19, t1+0=19, t1+1=20, t1+2=21.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think H=2.\n\nThe sequence: actions at t=19 and t=20.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} = U\n\nThen at turn t1 + H, position is (0,9), with H=2.\n\nt1 + H -1? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe player starts at turn t1 with position, then after H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H} =9 for some H.\n\nIn the sequence, after k actions, position at turn t1 + k.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t1, position y_t1.\n\nAfter first action, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd we want minimal H.\n\nIn this case, from y19=7, after two actions: a19=U, y20=8; a20=U, y21=9. So at t21, y=9, H=2.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=19 to t=20 and t=20 to t=21, so actions at t=19 and t=20.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t1} for action at t1, which affects position at t1+1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the box, it should list the actions starting from t1.\n\nBut is there a problem with the cars?\n\nPerhaps I need to check if on the way, but since I only move to y=8, and I checked turn 19 and 20.\n\nAt turn 19, I am on y=7, safe.\n\nAt turn 20, on y=8, safe.\n\nThen to y=9.\n\nBut what about freeway 9? No cars, safe.\n\nBut y=9 is not a freeway with cars, freeways are 1 to 8.\n\nSo y=9 is safe.\n\nBut let me see the car that was at (0,-11) on freeways 1-4 at t19.\n\nFor example, on freeway 1 at t19: cars [-59,-48] and [-11,0].\n\n[-11,0] at t19, so at x=0, it is occupied? Span is [τ,h] = [-11,0], so positions from -11 to 0 inclusive? So x=0 is included, I think.\n\nFor the car (0,-11,right,6), head=0, tail=-11, so for right-moving, span is [τ,h] = [-11,0], so it includes x from -11 to 0, so x=0 is occupied at turn 19 on freeway 1.\n\nBut I am not on freeway 1, I am on y=7, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 20, on freeway 1, the car would be at [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6], so from -5 to 6, which includes x=0? -5 to 6, yes, 0 is between -5 and 6, so occupied.\n\nBut again, not relevant for me.\n\nBack to my path.\n\nI think it should be fine.\n\nBut why do I feel like it might not be that simple? Perhaps for freeway 8 at turn 20, the car from -17 to -6, but -6 is at x=-6, not 0.\n\nSimilarly, no car at 0.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach faster? In one turn? From y=7 to y=9 in one action? But actions only change y by +1, -1, or 0, so I need at least two steps to go from 7 to 9, since 9-7=2, and each U changes by +1, so minimum two actions.\n\nSo H=2 is minimum possible.\n\nAnd it seems possible.\n\nBut perhaps on freeway 8 at turn 20, there is a car covering x=0.\n\nFrom above, no.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car positions.\n\nAnother thing: for freeway 7 and 8, the cars are the same as per table.\n\nBut let me list for freeway 8 at turn 20 again.\n\nt=20, Δt=1 from t19.\n\nCar1: original at t19: [-59,-48], move right by 6: [-53,-42]\n\nCar2: original [-23,-12], move to [-17,-6]\n\nCar3: original [13,24], move to [19,30]\n\nNone cover 0.\n\nSimilarly, if I were to stay or something, but I don't need.\n\nBut perhaps for later, but I only need two turns.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that at turn 19, if I go up, to y=8 at turn 20, but what if at turn 20, on y=8, it is not safe, but I think it is.\n\nPerhaps the car with (24,13) — head=24, tail=13, so at t19, [13,24], which is fine.\n\nBut let me see the position at x=0 over time for different freeways.\n\nFor example, on freeway 7, at what turns is x=0 occupied.\n\nAt turn T, car spans on freeway 7.\n\nGeneral: for a car with span at t19, at time T, position shifted by s(T-19) =6(T-19)\n\nFirst car: from -59 to -48 at t19. So left end at t19: -59, right end -48.\n\nAt time T, left end: -59 + 6(T-19)\n\nRight end: -48 + 6(T-19)\n\nSimilarly, second car: left -23, right -12 at t19\n\nAt T: left -23 +6(T-19), right -12 +6(T-19)\n\nThird car: left 13, right 24 at t19\n\nAt T: left 13 +6(T-19), right 24 +6(T-19)\n\nNow, x=0 is occupied if for some car, left <= 0 <= right.\n\nFor first car: -59 +6(T-19) <= 0 <= -48 +6(T-19)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor first car: -59 +6(Δt) <= 0 <= -48 +6(Δt) where Δt = T-19\n\n0 <= -48 +6(Δt) and -59 +6(Δt) <=0\n\nFrom 0 <= -48 +6(Δt) => 6(Δt) >=48 => Δt >= 8\n\nFrom -59 +6(Δt) <=0 => 6(Δt) <=59 => Δt <= 59/6 =9.833, so Δt <=9 since integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -48 +6(Δt) => 6(Δt) >=48, Δt >=8\n\nAnd -59 +6(Δt) <=0 always for Δt>=10? Let's see inequality.\n\nFor 0 to be in [left, right], need left <=0 and 0<= right.\n\nSo for first car: left <=0: -59 +6(Δt) <=0 => 6(Δt) <=59 => Δt <= 9 since 6*9=54<59, 6*10=60>59, so Δt <=9\n\n0<=right: 0 <= -48 +6(Δt) => 48 <=6(Δt) => Δt >=8\n\nSo for Δt=8,9\n\nSimilarly, at Δt=8: left = -59+48= -11, right= -48+48=0, so [ -11, 0], includes 0.\n\nAt Δt=9: left=-59+54= -5, right=-48+54=6, [ -5,6], includes 0.\n\nSimilarly, for second car: left -23 +6(Δt) <=0 and 0<= -12 +6(Δt)\n\n0<= -12 +6(Δt) => 12<=6(Δt) => Δt >=2\n\nleft <=0: -23 +6(Δt) <=0 => 6(Δt) <=23 => Δt <=3 since 6*3=18<23, 6*4=24>23, so Δt <=3\n\nThus for Δt=2,3\n\nAt Δt=2: left=-23+12= -11, right=-12+12=0, [-11,0] includes 0\n\nAt Δt=3: left=-23+18= -5, right=-12+18=6, [-5,6] includes 0\n\nFor third car: left 13 +6(Δt) <=0? 13>0, and increasing, so left always positive for Δt>=0, so 0 never <= left since left min 13>0, so never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nBut for freeway 7, x=0 occupied when Δt=2,3 or 8,9.\n\nΔt from t19, so at turn T= t19 + Δt.\n\nFor freeway 7, unsafe at T=19+2=21, T=19+3=22, T=19+8=27, T=19+9=28.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 8, same cars, same unsafe times: T=21,22,27,28.\n\nNow, back to my plan: at turn 19, I am on y=7, which is safe (T=19, Δt=0, not unsafe).\n\nThen after U, at turn 20, I am on y=8.\n\nTurn 20: T=20, Δt=1, which is not unsafe for y=8, since unsafe at 21,22,etc.\n\nAt Δt=1, for freeway 8: as before, positions not covering 0.\n\nThen at turn 20, I go U to y=9.\n\nSo at turn 21, I am on y=9, safe.\n\nTurn 21: T=21, but y=9, no cars, so no issue.\n\nBut if I were on freeway 8 at turn 21, it would be unsafe, but I am not, I am at y=9.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nThus, with two actions: U at t19 and U at t20, I reach y=9 at t21.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions at t19 and t20.\n\nNow, but let me confirm the answer format.\n\nIt says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn the box, it should list the actions.\n\nSo for H=2:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U  (which is for turn 19)\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} = U  (turn 20)\n\nThen done.\n\nBut is there a reason to take more turns? Probably not, since H=2 is min.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but no.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 19, if I go down or stay, but that would take more turns, so worse.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=7 at turn 19, then y20=7, but at turn 20, on y=7, is it safe?\n\nTurn 20: T=20, Δt=1, freeway 7.\n\nCars: first car: -59+6= -53, -48+6= -42, [-53,-42]\n\nSecond: -23+6= -17, -12+6= -6, [-17,-6]\n\nThird: 13+6=19,24+6=30, [19,30]\n\n0 not in, so safe. But if I stay, I need to go up later, which takes more actions.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down to y=6, then I have to come back, even worse.\n\nSo no point.\n\nThus, minimal H=2 with U,U.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I can.\n\nBut let me see the initial position: (0,7) at turn 19.\n\nAnd cars, but for freeway 7, at turn 19, the car (24,13) is [13,24], which is fine.\n\nBut I think I should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be in the box.\n\nBut let me see if for freeway 8 at turn 20, it is safe, which I think.\n\nAnother thought: the car on freeway 1-4 with (0,-11) at t19, which covers x=0, but I am not there.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps the player can move to avoid, but in this case, no need.\n\nSo I think H=2 is possible.\n\nBut let me check the car states again.\n\n\"Car State:\n| Freeway k | Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s) |  \n|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | (-48, -59, right, 6), (0, -11, right, 6) |\n| 2 | (-48, -59, right, 6), (0, -11, right, 6) |\n| 3 | (-48, -59, right, 6), (0, -11, right, 6) |\n| 4 | (-48, -59, right, 6), (0, -11, right, 6) |\n| 5 | (-48, -59, right, 6), (-12, -23, right, 6), (24, 13, right, 6) |\n| 6 | (-48, -59, right, 6), (-12, -23, right, 6), (24, 13, right, 6) |\n| 7 | (-48, -59, right, 6), (-12, -23, right, 6), (24, 13, right, 6) |\n| 8 | (-48, -59, right, 6), (-12, -23, right, 6), (24, 13, right, 6) |\"\n\nYes.\n\nFor freeway 7 and 8, no car covering x=0 at turn 19 or 20.\n\nAt turn 19, on freeway 7, the second car is (-12,-23), so [-23,-12], which is from -23 to -12, not including 0.\n\nThird car [13,24], not 0.\n\nSimilarly at turn 20, as before.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2, with actions U at t19 and U at t20.\n\nSo in the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\n}\n\nBut in the format, it should be with t_1, but since t_1=19, it's fine.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\nTurn t_1: U  \nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\nAnd H=2.\n\nBut let me see the sequence index.\n\nThe sequence is \\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: a_{t1 +0} = a_{t1}\n\nt=1: a_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nup to t=H-1.\n\nThen position after H actions is y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, H=2, t from 0 to 1.\n\na_{t1 +0} = a_{19} = U\n\na_{t1 +1} = a_{20} = U\n\nThen y_{21} =9.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's it.\n\nBut I recall that in the car update, for the car with (0,-11) on freeway 1, at t19, it covers x=0, but I am not there.\n\nSimilarly, perhaps for y=8, but no.\n\nAnother thing: the note says that when you move, at the turn you move, you are not on the new freeway.\n\nBut in my case, when I move from y=7 to y=8 at turn 19 action, at turn 20 I am on y=8.\n\nAnd at turn 20, I am on y=8, which is safe.\n\nThen I move to y=9 at turn 20 action, at turn 21 on y=9.\n\nNo issue.\n\nIf I were to move and at the same turn, but no.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8 at turn 20, the car [-17,-6] includes x=-6, but not 0.\n\n-6 is not 0.\n\nSo I think minimal H=2 with U,U.\n\nBut let me see if H=1 is possible? No, because from y=7, with one action, I can go to y=6,7,8, not to 9 directly. So impossible in one turn.\n\nThus H=2 is minimal and achievable.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: U\n}\n\nBut in the format, with t_1.\n\nSince t_1 is given as 19, but in general, it should be with symbols, but here it's specified.\n\nThe answer format says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so I think it's fine to write the numbers.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 19\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 7\\) on turn 19.\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\), at least two actions are required since each action changes \\(y\\) by at most \\(\\pm 1\\).\n- The sequence of actions must ensure that at each turn, the player is not on a freeway (y between 1 and 8) where a car occupies \\(x = 0\\).\n\n### Car Positions and Safety Check:\n- **Freeway 7 at turn 19**: Cars with spans \\([-59, -48]\\), \\([-23, -12]\\), and \\([13, 24]\\).

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 20, and the player is at (0,8). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nNote: The player moves vertically (y-direction) and the cars move horizontally on fixed freeways (y=1 to y=8). The player is at x=0 at all times, and we care about whether at the turn when the player is on a freeway (y between 1 and 8) the car spans at that turn include x=0.\n\nImportant: The collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn the player is on freeway y_T and there is a car on that freeway whose span (at turn T) includes 0.\n\nAlso note: When moving from one freeway to another at turn T, at turn T the player is still on the old freeway (y_T) and then at turn T+1 the player is on the new freeway (y_{T+1]). Therefore, when moving from y=8 to y=9 (which is not a freeway) at turn T, at turn T the player is still on freeway 8 and must avoid the cars on freeway 8 at that turn. Then at turn T+1, the player is at y=9 and there are no freeways above 8, so no car collision.\n\nBut note: the goal is to reach (0,9). The player is currently at (0,8). So the minimal moves would be to go up once (U) to reach 9. However, we must check if at the turn when we are at freeway 8 (which is the current turn and any subsequent turn until we leave) we are safe.\n\nHowever, we are allowed to wait (S) or even go down (D) to avoid collisions and then go up. But we are at turn 20 and we are at y=8. We need to check the car positions on freeway 8 at the turns when we are on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 has cars: \n  (-42, -53, right, 6)\n  (-6, -17, right, 6)\n  (30, 19, right, 6)\n\nBut note: the representation for right-moving cars: the span is [tail, head] and they move right (positive direction). However, in the given data, the car is represented as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving cars, the head is the rightmost? But the update rule says: for right-moving, the span at time T is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]? Actually, the update rule says:\n\nRight-moving: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the input, the car is given as (h, tau, d, s). So for the first car on freeway 8: (head = -42, tail = -53, right, 6). Since it's right-moving, the head should be the right end? But -42 is greater than -53. So the span at t1=20 is [tail, head] = [-53, -42]. Then at time T, it becomes [-53 + 6*(T-20), -42 + 6*(T-20)].\n\nSimilarly, the second car: (head = -6, tail = -17, right, 6) -> span at t1: [-17, -6]\nThird car: (30, 19, right, 6) -> [19,30]? But wait, 19 is less than 30, so that makes sense.\n\nBut note: the second car: head=-6, tail=-17 -> so the car is from -17 to -6? That is a length of 11? And moving right.\n\nNow, we are at turn 20 and we are on freeway 8. We are at x=0. We must check at which turns the cars on freeway 8 will have a span that includes 0.\n\nWe are going to plan for the next few turns. Since we are at y=8 and we want to go to y=9, the minimal action is to use U at turn 20. Then at turn 21 we would be at y=9. But we must check:\n\nAt turn 20 (current turn): we are at y=8. We must check if any car on freeway 8 at turn 20 has 0 in its span.\n\nAt turn 20 (current time, so T=20):\n\nCar1: span = [-53 + 6*(20-20), -42 + 6*(0)] = [-53, -42] -> does not contain 0? (since -42 is less than 0? Actually, -42 is negative and -53 is more negative, so 0 is not in between).\n\nCar2: [-17 + 0, -6 + 0] = [-17, -6] -> 0 is not in this interval? (because -6 < 0, so no).\n\nCar3: [19, 30] -> 0 is not in [19,30].\n\nSo at turn 20, we are safe.\n\nBut if we move up at turn 20, then at turn 21 we are at y=9 and we have reached the goal. However, note that at turn 20 we are at y=8 and we are safe. Then we do action U at turn 20: then at turn 21, we are at y=9. But note: during turn 21, we are at y=9 and there are no freeways above 8, so we are safe. Therefore, we can do:\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nThen we are done in 1 turn.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1. So H=1: we are at turn 20 (t1) and we take action at turn 20, then at the next state (turn 21) we are at (0,9). So H=1.\n\nBut let me double-check: when we are at turn 20, we are at (0,8). We take action U at turn 20. Then the update: y_{21} = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nAt turn 20: we are at y=8 and we have already checked that the cars on freeway 8 at turn 20 do not cover 0. So no collision.\n\nAt turn 21: we are at y=9, which is not a freeway (freeways are 1 to 8), so no car to collide with.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 1 and the action is U.\n\nBut why are there cars on other freeways? We don't care because we are only at freeway 8 at turn 20 and then we leave to 9.\n\nHowever, let me check the other freeways just in case? Actually, we don't need to because we are only on freeway 8 at turn 20 and then we are at 9 at turn 21.\n\nBut what if we had to go through other freeways? We don't because we are already at 8 and we only need to go to 9.\n\nBut wait: the goal is (0,9). The player is at (0,8). So we only need to move up once.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Here H=1, so t=0 to H-1 = 0 to 0, so only one action at t=0 (which is turn t1 + 0 = 20).\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 20: U\n}\n\nBut let me be cautious: what if the car positions at turn 20 on freeway 8 are safe, but what if we wait? We don't need to because we can move immediately.\n\nHowever, let me check the car positions for future turns? Because if we wait (S) at turn 20, then we remain at y=8 at turn 21. Then we must check freeway 8 at turn 21.\n\nAt turn 21 (T=21, so T-t1 = 1):\n\nCar1: [-53 + 6*1, -42 + 6*1] = [-47, -36] -> doesn't cover 0.\nCar2: [-17+6, -6+6] = [-11,0] -> wait! 0 is included? Because the span is [-11,0]. So if we are at y=8 at turn 21 and x=0, then we collide with the second car.\n\nSimilarly, car3: [19+6, 30+6] = [25,36] -> safe.\n\nSo if we do S at turn 20, then at turn 21 we are still at y=8 and we collide with the second car on freeway 8 (because the car spans [ -11, 0 ] at turn 21).\n\nTherefore, we cannot wait. But we don't want to wait anyway because we can go up.\n\nBut what if we go down? Then we go to y=7 at turn 21. Then we are on freeway 7 at turn 21. But freeway 7 has the same cars as freeway 8? Actually, the table:\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 8? Let me see:\n\nFreeway 7: \n  (-42, -53, right, 6)\n  (-6, -17, right, 6)\n  (30, 19, right, 6)\n\nSo at turn 21, the cars on freeway 7:\n\nCar1: [-53+6, -42+6] = [-47,-36] -> safe.\nCar2: [-17+6, -6+6] = [-11,0] -> so 0 is included! So if we are at freeway 7 at turn 21, we collide.\n\nTherefore, going down at turn 20 would lead to a collision at turn 21.\n\nThus, the only safe move is to go up at turn 20.\n\nBut wait: what about the other freeways? We are not going to be on them, so we don't care.\n\nTherefore, the minimal and safe action is to go up at turn 20.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". Since we can do it in 1 turn, that is minimal.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 20: U\n}\n\nBut let me check the car positions again for freeway 8 at turn 20:\n\nCar1: (-53, -42) -> at turn 20: [-53, -42] -> 0 not in there.\nCar2: (-17, -6) -> [-17,-6] -> 0 not in there? Because -6 < 0, so 0 is greater than -6? So no.\nCar3: (19,30) -> [19,30] -> no.\n\nYes, safe.\n\nAnd at turn 21, we are at y=9, safe.\n\nTherefore, we are done.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) on turn \\(t_1 = 20\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Current position (turn 20):** The player is at \\(y = 8\\).\n- **Goal:** Reach \\(y = 9\\), which requires moving up once (action \\(U\\)).\n- **Collision check on freeway 8 at turn 20:**\n  - Cars on freeway 8:\n    - \\((-42, -53, \\text{right}, 6)\\): Span at \\(T = 20\\) is \\([-53 + 6 \\times (20-20), -42 + 6 \\times (20-20)] = [-53, -42]\\). Since \\(-53 \\leq 0 \\leq -42\\) is false (0 is not in the interval), no collision.\n    - \\((-6, -17, \\text{right}, 6)\\): Span at \\(T = 20\\) is \\([-17 + 6 \\times (20-20), -6 + 6 \\times (20-20)] = [-17, -6]\\). 0 is not in this interval.\n    - \\((30, 19, \\text{right}, 6)\\): Span at \\(T = 20\\) is \\([19 + 6 \\times (20-20), 30 + 6 \\times (20-20)] = [19, 30]\\). 0 is not in this interval.\n  - **Conclusion:** At turn 20, the player is safe on freeway 8.\n\n### Plan:\n- Execute action \\(U\\) at turn 20:\n  - Player moves to \\(y = 8 + 1 = 9\\) at turn 21.\n  - At turn 21, the player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway (freeways are \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)), so no car collision is possible.\n- **Minimal turns:** \\(H = 1\\) (only one action needed, starting at turn 20).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence consists of one action at turn 20:\n- Turn 20: \\(U\\)\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal at turn 21 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 20 + 1 - 1 = 20\\) is the turn of the last action, and the position updates to (0, 9) at turn 21).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 20: U\n}",
