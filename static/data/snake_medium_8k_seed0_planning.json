        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 0, and the snake is at position (3,3) with direction left. That means the head is moving left, so from (3,3), if it continues left, it would go to (2,3).\n\nThe grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), and (6,3). So I should sketch a grid to visualize this.\n\nThe grid is from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so 8x8 grid, with walls on the borders.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (3,5) with value 1 and life span 10\n\n- (2,2) with value 1 and life span 10\n\n- (4,3) with value 1 and life span 10\n\nAll food is positive since value is +1, and life span 10 means they disappear after 10 turns, including the current turn, so countdown starts now.\n\nSnake positions: only [(3,3)], so the snake has only one segment? That means it's just the head, no body yet. Since it's a list with one position, so length 1.\n\nSnake head direction is L, left.\n\nNow, since the snake has no body except the head, there are no body collision risks yet. Also, tail reward danger isn't an issue because there's no tail.\n\nI need to choose actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and ensure survival.\n\nFirst, possible moves from (3,3):\n\n- Left (L) to (2,3)\n\n- Right (R) to (4,3) – but (4,3) has food? Food at (4,3) is listed, but is that a cell I can move to?\n\n(4,3) is a food position, but I need to check if it's not a wall or obstacle.\n\nWalls: internal obstacles include (4,4) and (6,3), but (4,3) is not listed as an obstacle or wall. Borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (4,3) should be free, but there's food there.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) should be free? Let's list all obstacles:\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n(4,4) is obstacle, but (4,3) is not, so (4,3) is free but has food.\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, but (2,3) is not listed, so should be free.\n\nAlso, (3,5) and (2,2) are food, not obstacles.\n\nNow, moving to a food cell means eating it, so if I move to (4,3), I eat the food there, which is positive, so snake length increases by 1.\n\nSince current length is 1, after eating, length becomes 2, with head at (4,3) and tail at previous position, which was (3,3).\n\nBut the tail will move when the snake moves next.\n\nSimilarly for other food.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid walls and obstacles.\n\nFrom (3,3), possible moves:\n\n- Left (L) to (2,3): is (2,3) valid? x=2,y=3, not border (borders are x=0,7 y=0,7), and not in obstacles: obstacles are (1,4), (2,4), etc. (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,3) is different y, so should be free. (2,3) not listed, so ok.\n\n- Right (R) to (4,3): (4,3) has food, but it's not wall or obstacle, so I can move there and eat food.\n\n- Up (U) to (3,4): y=4, x=3. Not border, not obstacle? Obstacles include (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), but (3,4) is not listed, so should be free. (3,4) has no food listed, so empty cell.\n\n- Down (D) to (3,2): similarly, should be free, no food.\n\ny=2, x=3, not border, not in obstacles list.\n\nBut direction is currently L, left. And there's a rule: no instant reverse. Since direction is L, moving right would be opposite, so I cannot move right on the next turn? But this is turn 0, and I'm choosing action for turn 0.\n\nThe rule says: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nBut for turn 0, the current direction is given as L. So when I choose action for turn 0, I can choose any direction except opposite to current direction, which is R (right), because that would be reverse.\n\nCurrent direction is L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move right immediately.\n\nSimilarly, if I move up or down, that's fine.\n\nSo for turn 0, possible actions: L, U, D. Cannot R.\n\nNow, let's see the food:\n\n- (4,3) is adjacent, but to move right, which is reverse, not allowed. So I cannot go to (4,3) directly from (3,3) with direction L, because moving R is forbidden.\n\n- (3,5) is at (3,5), which is two cells up from (3,3), since (3,3) to (3,4) to (3,5).\n\n- (2,2) is at (2,2), which is down-left from (3,3): to (3,2) then (2,2) or (2,3) then (2,2), etc.\n\nAlso, life span: all food has life span 10, starting from turn 0, so they will disappear after turn 10, but since we're only planning a few turns, they might last.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nSince the snake is length 1, no body, so I can go anywhere without self-collision risk for now.\n\nBut when I eat food, length increases, and body is created.\n\nAlso, walls and obstacles to avoid.\n\nNow, let's consider the actions.\n\nFirst, for turn 0:\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L (since R not allowed)\n\nMove L to (2,3): no food there.\n\nMove U to (3,4): no food.\n\nMove D to (3,2): no food.\n\n(4,3) has food but I can't go there directly because reverse not allowed.\n\nI could go to (2,3) or (3,4) or (3,2), then next turn go to the food or something.\n\nBut (4,3) is right next to me, but I can't reach it this turn.\n\nUnless I change direction, but I can't reverse.\n\nSo for turn 0, I cannot eat (4,3) immediately.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) is up, two cells away, (2,2) is down-left.\n\nNow, I should think about getting to food safely.\n\nAlso, after moving, the direction changes to the move I make.\n\nFor example, if I move U on turn 0, head to (3,4), direction becomes U.\n\nThen next turn, I can move U, L, R, but not D (down, opposite).\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, let's list the grid positions for clarity.\n\nGrid: 8x8, cells from (0,0) to (7,7). Borders walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cannot go there.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\nSo cells to avoid: all border and these points.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7: walls\n\n- (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), (5,6), (6,3): obstacles\n\nFood at (3,5), (2,2), (4,3)\n\nSnake at (3,3) with dir L.\n\nFor turn 0, actions: U, D, L\n\nIf I move L to (2,3): position (2,3), no food eaten, so snake still length 1, head at (2,3), direction now L (since I moved left).\n\nThen from (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4), but (2,4) is obstacle? Obstacles include (2,4), yes, (2,4) is an internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nD to (2,2): (2,2) has food, so I can move there and eat.\n\nL to (1,3): x=1,y=3, not border (x=0 is border, but x=1 is not, y=3 not 0 or 7), and (1,3) not in obstacles? Obstacles have (1,4), but (1,3) is different, so should be free.\n\nR to (3,3): but (3,3) is where I was, but now it's empty since snake moved, but moving right to (3,3) would be back, but (3,3) is not occupied now, but direction: from (2,3), if I move R to (3,3), that would be east, opposite to current direction L? Current direction after move L is L, so moving right would be opposite, not allowed.\n\nAfter moving to (2,3) with L, direction is L, so cannot move R (right).\n\nPossible moves from (2,3): U, D, L? U to (2,4) is obstacle, cannot. D to (2,2) possible, L to (1,3) possible, R not allowed. So only D or L.\n\nIf I go D to (2,2), I eat the food, length becomes 2, head at (2,2), tail at (2,3)? When I eat, the tail doesn't move immediately; after eating, the snake grows, so positions: head to new position, and body segments remain, but since it was length 1, after eating, positions become [(2,2), (2,3)] or something.\n\nLet's clarify snake movement.\n\nWhen snake moves without eating: head moves to new cell, tail moves off the last cell, so if length 1, moving to new cell, the old cell is empty.\n\nWhen eating: head moves to food cell, food is eaten, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move; the snake grows by one segment.\n\nFor example, start: snake at [(3,3)], length 1.\n\nIf I move to a cell with food, say to (4,3) but I can't this turn.\n\nSuppose I move to (2,2) which has food.\n\nFrom (2,3), if I move D to (2,2), which has food, so I eat it.\n\nThen new positions: head at (2,2), and since I ate, length increases, so tail segment is added at the previous position, which was (2,3). But (2,3) was the head position before move? Let's think.\n\nBefore move: positions [(3,3)] for turn 0.\n\nAfter move: if I move to (2,3) without eating, positions become [(2,3)], still length 1.\n\nThen from there, if I move to (2,2) with food, then after move, head at (2,2), and since food eaten, new segment added at the tail position, which is the previous head position (2,3). So positions become [(2,2), (2,3)], length 2.\n\nThen on next move, if I move, say, L to (1,2), then head to (1,2), tail moves from (2,3) to? When moving, head moves to new cell, tail moves off, so if no eat, positions become [(1,2), (2,2)].\n\nBut if I eat, tail stays and new segment added.\n\nBack to turn 0.\n\nOption 1: move L to (2,3)\n\nThen at (2,3), no food, so snake at [(2,3)], dir L.\n\nThen for turn 1, from (2,3), I can move D to (2,2) or L to (1,3) (since U to (2,4) obstacle, R not allowed).\n\nIf I move D to (2,2), I eat food, length 2, positions [(2,2), (2,3)], dir D (since I moved down).\n\nThen from there, I need to move, but now there is body, so risk of collision.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nOption 2: move U from (3,3) to (3,4)\n\n(3,4) is free? No obstacles, no food, so snake to [(3,4)], dir U.\n\nThen from (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), which has food! (3,5) is food with value 1.\n\nOr L to (2,4), but (2,4) is obstacle, cannot.\n\nR to (4,4), but (4,4) is obstacle, cannot.\n\nD to (3,3), but that would be down, opposite to current dir U, not allowed.\n\nCurrent dir is U, so cannot move D.\n\nSo from (3,4), only possible move is U to (3,5), since L and R are obstacles, D not allowed.\n\nU to (3,5) is possible, and has food.\n\nSo if I move U on turn 0 to (3,4), then on turn 1 I must move U to (3,5) and eat food.\n\nThen after turn 1, head at (3,5), ate food, so length 2, positions [(3,5), (3,4)], dir U.\n\nThen I need to think ahead.\n\nOption 3: move D from (3,3) to (3,2)\n\n(3,2) no food, snake at [(3,2)], dir D.\n\nThen from (3,2), possible moves: D to (3,1), or L to (2,2) or R to (4,2) or U to (3,3), but U is up, opposite to D, not allowed.\n\nAlso, (2,2) has food, (4,2) is free? Let's see.\n\n(3,1): y=1, not border, not obstacle, free.\n\n(2,2): has food, but is it accessible? (2,2) not wall or obstacle.\n\n(4,2): x=4,y=2, not border, not obstacle (obstacles at (4,4), etc., not (4,2)), so free.\n\nU to (3,3) not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: D, L, R from (3,2).\n\nNow, I need to think 5 turns ahead to maximize score.\n\nFirst, let's list the food and their positions:\n\n- (3,5): value 1, life 10\n\n- (2,2): value 1, life 10\n\n- (4,3): value 1, life 10\n\nAll same value and life.\n\nBut (4,3) is close, but I can't reach it directly from (3,3) because reverse not allowed.\n\nI can reach it later.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), if I move U to (3,4), then to (3,5), eat that, then from (3,5), I can move to other places.\n\nOr move D to (3,2), then to (2,2) or elsewhere.\n\nMove L to (2,3), then to (2,2) or (1,3).\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat food, but avoid dying.\n\nAlso, since life span is 10, and we're at turn 0, I have time.\n\nBut I need to plan multiple moves.\n\nMoreover, after eating, the snake grows, so it might block paths.\n\nCurrently, length 1, no problem.\n\nLet's consider the option where I go for (3,5) first.\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 1: move U to (3,5), eat food, length 2, positions [(3,5), (3,4)], dir U.\n\nNow, from (3,5), direction U, so cannot move D (down).\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,6), but y=6, not border? y=7 is border, so y=6 is ok, but is there obstacle? Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3) — (3,6) not listed, so should be free. No food mentioned.\n\nL to (2,5): (2,5) free? x=2,y=5, not border, not obstacle, free.\n\nR to (4,5): similarly free.\n\nBut cannot D.\n\nNow, if I move U to (3,6), no food, then positions: head to (3,6), tail to (3,5)? When moving without eating, head to new cell, tail moves off, so positions become [(3,6), (3,5)], since no eat.\n\nThen from there, I can move, etc.\n\nBut there is food at (2,2) and (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), which is below.\n\nFrom (3,5) or (3,6), I need to go down, but direction might be U, so I need to turn.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) after eating, dir U.\n\nIf I move L to (2,5), then head at (2,5), positions [(2,5), (3,5)] if no eat, but (2,5) no food, so yes, positions [(2,5), (3,5)], dir L.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can move to (2,4)? But (2,4) is obstacle! Cannot.\n\nU to (2,6), possible? y=6, not border.\n\nD to (2,4) obstacle, cannot.\n\nL to (1,5), possible.\n\nR to (3,5), but (3,5) is the tail, but since tail will move, it might be ok, but let's see.\n\nFrom (2,5), with dir L, possible moves: U, D, L? But D to (2,4) obstacle, so only U or L.\n\nU to (2,6), or L to (1,5).\n\nIf U to (2,6), then positions [(2,6), (2,5)] or something.\n\nThis might not be efficient to get to other food.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,5) if I move R to (4,5), then similar.\n\nBut I need to get to (4,3) or (2,2).\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), which is below, so I need to go down eventually.\n\nBut from (3,5) dir U, I cannot go down immediately.\n\nI could go left or right, then down.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), move L to (2,5), then from (2,5), I can only go U or L, since D is obstacle and R not allowed? After moving to (2,5) with L, dir is L.\n\nFrom (2,5), dir L, possible moves: U to (2,6), L to (1,5), D not allowed (opposite? D is down, not opposite to L, opposite would be R, but D is perpendicular.\n\nDirections: U, D, L, R are orthogonal.\n\nOpposite means if current direction is L, opposite is R; if U, opposite is D, etc.\n\nPerpendicular moves are allowed.\n\nSo from (2,5), current dir L, I can move U (up), D (down), or L (left), but not R (right).\n\nNow, D to (2,4) is obstacle, so cannot.\n\nU to (2,6) possible, L to (1,5) possible.\n\nBut (2,4) is obstacle, so I cannot go down from (2,5).\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (4,5) from (3,5), (4,5) is free, dir R.\n\nThen from (4,5), can move U, D, R, not L (opposite).\n\nD to (4,4) but (4,4) is obstacle, cannot.\n\nU to (4,6), possible.\n\nR to (5,5), possible? (5,5) free? Not obstacle, yes.\n\nBut again, hard to go down because of obstacles.\n\nSo from (3,5), after eating, I might be stuck going up or sideways, but not down easily because at y=5, to go to y=3 or below, I need to go through x, but the obstacles at (2,4) and (4,4) block direct down from some positions.\n\n(2,4) and (4,4) are obstacles, so at y=4, x=2 and x=4 are blocked, but x=3,4? (3,4) is not obstacle, but from above, to reach (3,4), I need to be at (3,5) or something.\n\n(3,4) is the position we were at earlier.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can only go U, L, or R, not D.\n\nIf I go L to (2,5), then from (2,5) I can go L to (1,5) or U to (2,6), but not down.\n\nSimilarly, if I go R to (4,5), I can go R to (5,5) or U to (4,6), not down.\n\nSo if I go to (3,5) and eat, I might not be able to get back down easily to eat the other food, at least not soon.\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), which is low y, and (4,3) at (4,3).\n\nBut from the top, it might be hard to reach.\n\nFor example, to get to (4,3) from (3,5), I need to go down, but at (3,5) I can't go down, so I have to go left or right, then down from there.\n\nBut from (2,5), I can go to (2,6) or (1,5), then from (1,5), I can go down to (1,4), but (1,4) is obstacle! (1,4) is internal obstacle, so cannot.\n\nFrom (1,5), dir after moving L to (1,5), dir L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,6), D to (1,4), L to (0,5) but x=0 is wall, cannot, R not allowed.\n\nD to (1,4) is obstacle, so cannot go down.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (4,5), then to (5,5), etc., (5,6) is obstacle, but (5,5) is free, then from (5,5) I can go down to (5,4), which is free, then to (5,3), etc., but that's far from (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), so from (5,4) I can go left to (4,4), but (4,4) is obstacle, cannot.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can go to (5,3), then to (4,3), but (4,3) is food, but let's see if I can reach.\n\nBut this seems messy and might take many turns.\n\nPerhaps it's better to first eat the food at (4,3) or (2,2), but (4,3) is close but I can't go directly.\n\nAnother option: on turn 0, move D to (3,2)\n\nThen at (3,2), no food, dir D.\n\nThen turn 1, from (3,2), I can move to (2,2) which has food, by moving L (left).\n\nL to (2,2) is left, which is perpendicular to current dir D, so allowed.\n\nThen I eat food at (2,2), so length 2, positions [(2,2), (3,2)], and since I moved L, dir L.\n\nThen from there, I can move to other places.\n\nSimilarly, I could move to (4,2) or (3,1) from (3,2), but moving to (2,2) eats food.\n\nOr move D to (3,1), no food.\n\nBut eating (2,2) seems good.\n\nThen after that, I can go for (4,3) or (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is up, (4,3) is right and up a bit.\n\nFrom (2,2) with dir L, possible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2), not R (opposite).\n\n(2,3) is free, no food.\n\n(2,1) free.\n\n(1,2) free.\n\nThen I can go to (2,3), for example.\n\nThen from (2,3), as before, can go to (1,3) or (2,2) but (2,2) is the tail? Positions are [(2,2), (3,2)] after eating at (2,2), so tail is at (3,2).\n\nIf I move from (2,2) to (2,3), no eat, then head to (2,3), tail moves to (2,2), so positions [(2,3), (2,2)].\n\nThen from (2,3), dir U (since moved up), then can move U to (2,4) but obstacle, cannot; D to (2,2) but (2,2) is the tail, but when I move, the tail will move, so it might be ok to move to tail position if it moves away.\n\nThe rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo from (2,3), with tail at (2,2), I can move D to (2,2), and since tail will move, it's ok, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, L to (1,3), or U not possible, R not allowed.\n\nU to (2,4) obstacle, so cannot.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (2,2) or L to (1,3).\n\nIf I move D to (2,2), head to (2,2), which is the current tail position, but since tail will move to where? When head moves to (2,2), which was tail, and no food, so tail moves off, but the cell (2,2) is occupied by head now, so the tail was at (2,2), head moves to (2,2), but at the same time, tail moves to the previous segment? Let's think.\n\nPositions before move: head at (2,3), body at (2,2) (tail).\n\nI move head to (2,2). Since (2,2) is occupied by tail, but the rule says it's allowed because tail moves away.\n\nAfter move, head is at (2,2), and the tail segment is removed, so positions become just [(2,2)]? No.\n\nSnake positions: before move, segments: index 0: (2,3) head, index 1: (2,2) tail.\n\nWhen head moves to new cell, if no eat, tail is removed from the list.\n\nSo if head moves to (2,2), which is the current tail position, but after move, head is at (2,2), and the tail cell is vacated, so the snake should be just the head at (2,2)? But that would mean the tail disappeared, length decreases? No.\n\nI think I'm confusing.\n\nStandard snake movement: when moving without eating, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail is removed, so the new positions are the new head and all segments except the last one, each shifted.\n\nFor example, positions [A, B, C] with A head, C tail.\n\nMove to new cell D, no eat: new positions [D, A, B], so tail C is removed.\n\nIf move to a cell with food, new positions [D, A, B, C], so C remains, new segment added.\n\nIn this case, from [(2,3), (2,2)], head (2,3), tail (2,2).\n\nMove head to (2,2): but (2,2) is currently occupied by tail. When head moves to (2,2), it is the same cell as tail, but at that moment, the tail is still there, but since we move simultaneously, and the rule says it's allowed because the tail will move away, but in this case, when head moves to (2,2), the tail should be removed, so the cell (2,2) is now head, and no tail there anymore.\n\nAfter move, positions: head is at (2,2), and the body segment is the previous head, so [ (2,2), (2,3) ]? Let's list:\n\nBefore move: segment 0: (2,3) head, segment 1: (2,2) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (2,2) without eating: the new head is at (2,2), and the body is the previous head position, so segment 0: (2,2) new head, segment 1: (2,3) new body (which was head), and the tail (2,2) is removed, so positions become [(2,2), (2,3)].\n\nBut (2,2) was tail, now it's head, and (2,3) is body.\n\nThen the tail cell is vacated.\n\nBut in this case, moving to (2,2) which was tail position is fine, no problem.\n\nThen positions are [(2,2), (2,3)] with head at (2,2).\n\nDirection: I moved down from (2,3) to (2,2), so dir D.\n\nThen from there, I can move, etc.\n\nBut this might not be productive.\n\nFrom (2,2) after eating, I could move L to (1,2) or D to (2,1) or U to (2,3) but U to (2,3) is up, opposite to current dir L? After moving to (2,2) with L, dir is L.\n\nFrom (2,2), dir L, move U to (2,3): U is perpendicular to L, so allowed.\n\nU to (2,3), which is the body position, but again, tail will move, so ok.\n\nMove to (2,3), no eat, positions become [(2,3), (2,2)].\n\nDir U.\n\nBut (2,4) above is obstacle, so stuck.\n\nBetter to avoid that.\n\nBack to turn 0.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 0, move L to (2,3), no eat.\n\nThen turn 1, from (2,3), I can move D to (2,2) to eat the food there, or move L to (1,3).\n\nIf I move D to (2,2), eat, length 2, positions [(2,2), (2,3)], dir D.\n\nThen from (2,2), dir D, I can move L to (1,2), D to (2,1), or R to (3,2), not U (opposite).\n\n(3,2) is free, for example.\n\nThen I can go to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut I have food at (4,3) and (3,5) to consider.\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), which is near.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can go to (3,2), then to (4,2), then to (4,3), but (4,3) is food, so when I move to (4,3), I eat it.\n\nLet's see if that's possible.\n\nFrom (2,2) after eating (2,2), positions [(2,2), (2,3)], dir D.\n\nMove R to (3,2): no food, so positions become [(3,2), (2,2)], dir R (since moved right).\n\nThen from (3,2), dir R, can move U to (3,3), D to (3,1), R to (4,2), not L (opposite).\n\n(3,3) is free, no food.\n\n(4,2) free.\n\n(3,1) free.\n\nMove R to (4,2): no food, positions [(4,2), (3,2)], dir R.\n\nThen from (4,2), dir R, can move U to (4,3), which has food! So move U to (4,3), eat food, length now 3, positions: head to (4,3), new segment added, so positions [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2)].\n\nDir U.\n\nThen I can go for (3,5) later.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) is still available.\n\nLife span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nNow, the first food I ate was (2,2) on turn 1, then (4,3) on turn 3 or so.\n\nLet's count the turns.\n\nTurn 0: start at (3,3), move L to (2,3) - no eat\n\nTurn 1: move D to (2,2) - eat (2,2), length 2\n\nTurn 2: move R to (3,2) - no eat\n\nTurn 3: move R to (4,2) - no eat\n\nTurn 4: move U to (4,3) - eat (4,3), length 3\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,5).\n\nFrom (4,3), dir U, positions [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2)]\n\nCan move U to (4,4) but (4,4) is obstacle, cannot.\n\nL to (3,3), which is free, but (3,3) is not food.\n\nR to (5,3), but (6,3) is obstacle, (5,3) free? Not obstacle.\n\nD not allowed, opposite to U.\n\nSo possible: L to (3,3), R to (5,3)\n\nIf move L to (3,3), no food, positions: head to (3,3), tail moves from (3,2) to where? New positions [(3,3), (4,3), (4,2)]? Let's see: previous positions [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2)], head (4,3), body (4,2), tail (3,2)\n\nMove head to (3,3), no eat, so new head (3,3), body: previous head (4,3), and previous body (4,2), tail removed, so positions [(3,3), (4,3), (4,2)]\n\nDir L.\n\nThen from (3,3), dir L, can move U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3), not R.\n\n(3,4) free, (3,2) is the tail position? Current tail is at (4,2), so (3,2) is free now.\n\nMove U to (3,4), no food, positions [(3,4), (3,3), (4,3)], dir U.\n\nThen U to (3,5), which has food, eat, length 4, positions [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)]\n\nDir U.\n\nSo I ate all three foods by turn 5 or so.\n\nLet's list the turns:\n\n- Turn 0: move L from (3,3) to (2,3) no eat\n\n- Turn 1: move D from (2,3) to (2,2) eat (2,2)\n\n- Turn 2: move R from (2,2) to (3,2) no eat? From (2,2) to (3,2) is right, but after moving to (2,2) with D, dir is D, so moving R is perpendicular, allowed.\n\nPositions after turn 1: [(2,2), (2,3)] head (2,2)\n\nMove R to (3,2), no food, so new positions: head (3,2), body (2,2), tail removed? Previous positions: head (2,2), tail (2,3)\n\nMove head to (3,2), no eat, new head (3,2), body: previous head (2,2), so positions [(3,2), (2,2)]\n\nDir R.\n\nThen turn 3: from (3,2) move R to (4,2) no eat, positions [(4,2), (3,2)], dir R.\n\nTurn 4: from (4,2) move U to (4,3) eat (4,3), positions [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2)], dir U.\n\nNow turn 5: from (4,3) move L to (3,3) no eat, positions [(3,3), (4,3), (4,2)], dir L.\n\nTurn 6: from (3,3) move U to (3,4) no eat, positions [(3,4), (3,3), (4,3)], dir U.\n\nTurn 7: from (3,4) move U to (3,5) eat (3,5), positions [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)], dir U.\n\nBy turn 7, I ate all three foods.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5.\n\nIn the sequence above, by turn 4 I ate two foods.\n\nBut for the first action, on turn 0, I moved L to (2,3).\n\nI could consider going directly to (4,3) but I can't because reverse.\n\nAnother option: on turn 0, move D to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 1: move L to (2,2) eat (2,2), positions [(2,2), (3,2)], dir L.\n\nThen turn 2: move R to (3,2)? (3,2) is the tail position, move to it, no eat, positions become [(3,2), (2,2)], dir R.\n\nThen turn 3: move R to (4,2) no eat, positions [(4,2), (3,2)], dir R.\n\nTurn 4: move U to (4,3) eat (4,3), same as before.\n\nThen go to (3,5) similarly.\n\nBut it takes one extra turn to eat the first food.\n\nIn first sequence, ate (2,2) on turn 1, here ate on turn 1 as well? Turn 0 move to (3,2) no eat, turn 1 move to (2,2) eat.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf I go for (3,5) first.\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4) no eat\n\nTurn 1: move U to (3,5) eat, positions [(3,5), (3,4)], dir U.\n\nNow from (3,5), as before, I can only go U, L, R.\n\nSay move L to (2,5) no eat, positions [(2,5), (3,5)], dir L.\n\nThen from (2,5), can move U to (2,6) or L to (1,5), since D not possible.\n\nSay move L to (1,5), positions [(1,5), (2,5)], dir L.\n\nThen from (1,5), can move U to (1,6) or L to (0,5) but x=0 wall, cannot, or D to (1,4) obstacle, cannot, so only U to (1,6).\n\nThen stuck going up, hard to get down to (2,2) or (4,3).\n\nIf from (3,5) move R to (4,5), then to (5,5), etc., similar issue.\n\nSo it might be difficult to reach the other foods soon, whereas if I go for (2,2) and (4,3) first, I can get them easily and then go to (3,5).\n\nMoreover, (3,5) is at y=5, and with obstacles, it might be safer to eat the lower foods first.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,3) is at (4,3), which is adjacent to (3,3), but I can't eat it now.\n\nBut in the sequence I have, I eat it on turn 4.\n\nI could eat (4,3) sooner.\n\nHow? From (3,3), I can only go U, D, L, not R.\n\nIf I go to (3,4) on turn 0, then I'm stuck going to (3,5) on turn 1, and then I'm at (3,5) with body at (3,4), and I need to turn, but options limited.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) dir U, I can move L to (2,5), then from (2,5) dir L, I can move D but (2,4) obstacle, cannot, so I have to go left or up.\n\nThen to reach (4,3), I need to go to (4,5) or something, but (4,4) obstacle, so from (4,5) I can go to (5,5), then down to (5,4), then left to (5,3), then to (4,3), but (5,3) to (4,3) is left, but (4,3) is at (4,3), and (4,4) is obstacle, so from (5,3) I can move to (4,3) directly.\n\nBut it takes many turns: from (3,5) to (4,5) if possible, but from (3,5) I can move R to (4,5), no eat, positions [(4,5), (3,5)], dir R.\n\nThen from (4,5) dir R, can move U to (4,6), D to (4,4) obstacle cannot, R to (5,5), not L.\n\nSo move R to (5,5), positions [(5,5), (4,5)], dir R.\n\nThen from (5,5) dir R, move D to (5,4) no eat, positions [(5,4), (5,5)], dir D? Moved down, so dir D.\n\nThen from (5,4) dir D, move L to (5,3) no eat? (5,3) free? Not obstacle, yes, positions [(5,3), (5,4)], dir L.\n\nThen from (5,3) dir L, move L to (4,3) eat food, since (4,3) has food.\n\nSo on turn: start from turn 1 at (3,5)\n\nTurn 2: move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 3: move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 4: move D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 5: move L to (5,3)\n\nTurn 6: move L to (4,3) eat\n\nSo ate (4,3) on turn 6, whereas in the first sequence, I ate it on turn 4.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) is even farther.\n\nSo the first approach is better: go left or down first to eat (2,2), then to (4,3), then to (3,5).\n\nIn the first sequence with move L on turn 0, I ate (2,2) on turn 1, (4,3) on turn 4, (3,5) on turn 7.\n\nWith move D on turn 0, similar.\n\nBut on turn 0, if I move D to (3,2), then turn 1 move L to (2,2) eat, same as before.\n\nThen from there to (4,3).\n\nBut (3,5) is not eaten yet.\n\nNow, to output actions for at least 5 turns.\n\nI need to specify the actions.\n\nAlso, for the answer format, it should be a sequence of actions for turns starting from t1=0.\n\nSo for turn 0,1,2,3,4,5 or more.\n\nIn the sequence with move L on turn 0:\n\nTurn 0: move L\n\nThen snake to (2,3), dir L.\n\nTurn 1: move D to (2,2) eat\n\nNow positions [(2,2), (2,3)], dir D.\n\nTurn 2: from (2,2) dir D, I moved R to (3,2) no eat.\n\nBut I could move other directions, but to go to (4,3), moving R is fine.\n\nTurn 3: move R to (4,2) no eat? From (3,2) to (4,2), yes.\n\nTurn 4: move U to (4,3) eat.\n\nNow for turn 5, I need to specify.\n\nAfter turn 4, positions [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2)], dir U.\n\nThen turn 5: from (4,3) dir U, I can move L to (3,3) or R to (5,3), etc.\n\nI need to go to (3,5), so move L to (3,3).\n\nThen turn 6 move U to (3,4), turn 7 move U to (3,5).\n\nBut for 5 turns, I need up to turn 5.\n\nTurn 5 action.\n\nAfter turn 4, at (4,3) with dir U.\n\nPossible actions: L to (3,3), R to (5,3), U not possible (obstacle), D not allowed.\n\n(5,3) is free, but (6,3) is obstacle, but (5,3) ok.\n\nBut (3,3) is towards (3,5).\n\nSo move L to (3,3) on turn 5.\n\nThen the sequence:\n\nTurn 0: L\n\nTurn 1: D\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: L (to (3,3))\n\nThen later to (3,5).\n\nBut I need to output for 5+ turns, so at least 5 actions.\n\nSimilarly, if I start with move D on turn 0.\n\nTurn 0: move D to (3,2) no eat, dir D.\n\nTurn 1: move L to (2,2) eat, positions [(2,2), (3,2)], dir L.\n\nTurn 2: move R to (3,2) no eat? (3,2) is tail position, move to it, positions become [(3,2), (2,2)], dir R.\n\nTurn 3: move R to (4,2) no eat, positions [(4,2), (3,2)], dir R.\n\nTurn 4: move U to (4,3) eat, positions [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2)], dir U.\n\nTurn 5: move L to (3,3) no eat, positions [(3,3), (4,3), (4,2)], dir L.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIn this case, on turn 2, I moved to the tail position, which is fine.\n\nBut in the first sequence, I didn't need to do that.\n\nIn first sequence, after turn 1: at (2,2) with body at (2,3), I moved R to (3,2), which is a new cell, not tail.\n\nIn second, from (2,2) I moved to (3,2), which was the tail, but it works.\n\nBut both sequences are similar.\n\nNow, for the food at (3,5), I need to reach it.\n\nAfter turn 5, I can continue.\n\nBut for the output, I need to provide the actions.\n\nAlso, there might be a better way.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,3) is at (4,3), and on turn 0, I am at (3,3), direction L, so I can't go right.\n\nBut if I move U or D, I might be able to circle back.\n\nBut it seems slower.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (4,3) on a later turn.\n\nBut in the sequence above, I eat it on turn 4.\n\nSince all food has life span 10, it's fine.\n\nNow, for the action sequence, I think starting with L or D is fine.\n\nBut let's see the direction.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, so moving L is continuing, U or D is turning.\n\nBut for survival, since no body, all are safe.\n\nBut moving L to (2,3) is towards (2,2) food.\n\nSimilarly, moving D to (3,2) is towards (2,2).\n\nMoving U to (3,4) is towards (3,5).\n\nBut as we saw, going up might trap me, so better to go down or left.\n\nAlso, internal obstacles: at (2,4) and (4,4), which are above, so going down might be safer.\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), which is close to border? x=2,y=2, not border.\n\nBut let's choose the sequence.\n\nI think move L on turn 0.\n\nThen actions:\n\nTurn 0: L\n\nTurn 1: D (to eat (2,2))\n\nThen from there, to go to (4,3), I need to go right.\n\nAfter eating at (2,2), positions [(2,2), (2,3)], dir D.\n\nNow, to go to (4,3), I can move R to (3,2) as before.\n\nBut (3,2) is at (3,2), then to (4,2), then to (4,3).\n\nI could move U, but (2,3) is body, and above (2,4) obstacle, so I cannot go up, only down, left, or right.\n\nMove D to (2,1) or L to (1,2), but that might not help to reach (4,3).\n\nSo moving R to (3,2) is direct.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output 5 actions.\n\nSo let's define the sequence for turns 0 to 4 or 0 to 5.\n\nSince t1=0, turn 0 to 4 is 5 turns.\n\nOr up to turn 5.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" and t1=0.\n\nSo at least 5 actions, I think.\n\n\"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the sequence for the turns.\n\nI should output for, say, 6 turns to include eating (4,3).\n\nBut for now, let's do 5 actions.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 0: move L\n\nTurn 1: move D (eat (2,2))\n\nTurn 2: move R (to (3,2))\n\nTurn 3: move R (to (4,2))\n\nTurn 4: move U (to (4,3) eat)\n\nThen turn 5: move L (to (3,3))\n\nSo actions: L, D, R, R, U, L for turns 0 to 5.\n\nBut turn 4 is U to eat (4,3).\n\nNow, for (3,5), I can continue turn 6 U to (3,4), turn 7 U to (3,5).\n\nBut not needed for output.\n\nIn turn 5, I move L to (3,3), which is fine.\n\nTo make it efficient, but I think this is ok.\n\nAnother option: after eating (2,2) on turn 1, I could go directly to (3,5) but it's farther.\n\nFor example, from (2,2) dir D, move R to (3,2), then U to (3,3), then U to (3,4), then U to (3,5), but from (3,2) to (3,3) is up, which may be perpendicular or opposite depending on direction.\n\nAfter turn 1: at (2,2) dir D.\n\nMove R to (3,2): now from (2,2) to (3,2) is right, so dir becomes R.\n\nPositions [(3,2), (2,2)] if no eat.\n\nThen from (3,2) dir R, move U to (3,3): U is perpendicular, allowed.\n\nPositions [(3,3), (3,2)] if no eat.\n\nThen from (3,3) dir U (since moved up), move U to (3,4): allowed, positions [(3,4), (3,3)]\n\nThen move U to (3,5) eat, positions [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nBut in this case, I ate (3,5) on turn 4 or so, but I didn't eat (4,3) yet.\n\nAnd (4,3) is still there.\n\nThen I need to go to (4,3) from (3,5).\n\nBut from (3,5) dir U, I can move R to (4,5), then as before, it takes more turns to reach (4,3).\n\nWhereas if I eat (4,3) first, it's better.\n\nIn terms of score, eating any food gives +1, so order doesn't matter, but for efficiency, eating closer food first might save time.\n\nIn the first sequence, I eat (2,2) on turn 1, (4,3) on turn 4, (3,5) on turn 7.\n\nIn this alternative, eat (2,2) on turn 1, (3,5) on turn 4, then (4,3) later, say turn 8 or something.\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut with obstacles, from (3,5) to (4,3) might be harder, so better to eat (4,3) before going up.\n\nSo I think the first plan is fine.\n\nNow, for the action sequence:\n\nTurn 0: L\n\nTurn 1: D\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nThen for turn 5: L (to (3,3))\n\nI need to output at least 5 actions, so up to turn 5.\n\nBut turn 4 is U to eat (4,3), turn 5 is L to (3,3).\n\nIn the state, after turn 4, I am at (4,3), with positions including (3,2) and (4,2), but when I move to (3,3), no issue.\n\nNow, to confirm, no risks: when moving to (4,3) on turn 4, it has food, I eat it, no problem.\n\nMoving to (3,3) on turn 5, (3,3) is free, no collision.\n\nThen I can go to (3,4) and (3,5) later.\n\nLife span: all food has life 10, so by turn 7, still within 10 turns from turn 0.\n\nTurn 0 to turn 7 is 8 turns, life span decreases each turn including current, so at turn 0, life span 10, after one turn, life span 9, etc.\n\nFood spawned at turn 0? The state says \"current turn t1=0\", and food with life span 10, so it will disappear after turn 10, meaning on turn 11 it is gone, but available from turn 0 to turn 10.\n\nSo on turn 7, life span remaining: at turn t, life span decreases by t from initial.\n\nInitial life span 10 at turn 0, so at turn t, remaining life = 10 - t.\n\nSo at turn 7, remaining life 3, still available.\n\nNo problem.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to write the actions.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: L\nTurn 1: D\nTurn 2: R\nTurn 3: R\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: L\n}\n\nBut I should include more? Or at least 5, this is 6 actions.\n\n\"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the sequence for the turns.\n\nPerhaps 5 actions are enough.\n\nTo be safe, I can add one more.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nIn turn 5, moving L to (3,3), which is towards (3,5).\n\nThen for completeness.\n\nBut in the sequence, after turn 5 at (3,3), I can move U to (3,4) on turn 6, then U to (3,5) on turn 7.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nNow, I think this sequence works.\n\nIf on turn 0 I move D, similar but slightly different.\n\nBut with move L first, I go directly left.\n\nNow, the snake head direction after each move.\n\nAfter turn 0 move L, direction L.\n\nTurn 1 move D, direction D.\n\nTurn 2 move R, direction R.\n\nTurn 3 move R, direction R.\n\nTurn 4 move U, direction U.\n\nTurn 5 move L, direction L.\n\nAll valid, no reverse issues.\n\nNo wall or obstacle collisions.\n\nAte two foods by turn 4.\n\nSo I think it's good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the strategy involves planning multiple moves ahead to eat all available positive food efficiently. Given the current state at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\):\n- Snake position: head at (3,3), direction left (L), with no body segments (length 1).\n- Food: positive food at (3,5), (2,2), and (4,3), each with value +1 and life span 10.\n- Walls and obstacles: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Immediate constraints**: Current direction is L, so reverse move (R) is not allowed on turn 0. Moving to (4,3) is blocked due to this.\n- **Food prioritization**: (2,2) is accessible early and avoids the upper area with obstacles (e.g., (2,4) and (4,4)). (4,3) is targeted next, as it is close and can be reached after turning. (3,5) is saved for last due to obstacles limiting downward movement from the top.\n- **Path efficiency**: Sequence minimizes turns and avoids dead ends. After eating (2,2) and (4,3), the snake grows to length 3, but paths remain open to (3,5) with careful maneuvering.\n- **Collision avoidance**: No body collision risks initially. When moving to tail positions (e.g., turn 2 in sequence), it is safe as the tail moves away. Obstacles and walls are avoided.\n- **Life span**: All food has life span 10, disappearing after turn 10. The sequence eats (2,2) on turn 1, (4,3) on turn 4, and (3,5) by turn 7—all within 10 turns.\n\n### Planned Sequence (5+ turns ahead):\n1. **Turn 0**: Move L to (2,3) – Avoids reverse move, positions snake for (2,2). No food eaten.\n2. **Turn 1**: Move D to (2,2) – Eats food at (2,2), increasing length to 2. Positions: head (2,2), tail (2,3). Direction now D.\n3. **Turn 2**: Move R to (3,2) – Moves toward (4,3). No food. Positions: head (3,2), tail (2,2). Direction now R.\n4. **Turn 3**: Move R to (4,2) – Continues toward (4,3). No food. Positions: head (4,2), tail (3,2). Direction now R.\n5. **Turn 4**: Move U to (4,3) – Eats food at (4,3), increasing length to 3. Positions: head (4,3), body (4,2), tail (3,2). Direction now U.\n6. **Turn 5**: Move L to (3,3) – Positions snake for (3,5) by moving left. No food. Positions: head (3,3), body (4,3), tail (4,2). Direction now L.\n7. **Turn 6**: Move U to (3,4) – Continues toward (3,5). No food. Positions: head (3,4), body (3,3), tail (4,3). Direction now U.\n8. **Turn 7**: Move U to (3,5) – Eats food at (3,5), increasing length to 4. Positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), tail (3,3), and (4,3). Direction now U.\n\nThis sequence eats all food by turn 7, scoring +3, and ensures survival by avoiding all obstacles and walls. Beyond turn 7, the snake can navigate safely (e.g., move L to (2,5) or U to (3,6)) but is not needed for this output.\n\n### Output for Turns 0 to 5 (6 actions for completeness):\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: L \\\\\nTurn 1: D \\\\\nTurn 2: R \\\\\nTurn 3: R \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 2, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there are internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,2), body at (2,3). Since it's a list with two positions, the snake has a length of 2. Head direction is down, which is D. Moving down increases y? Let me check the movement constraints.\n\nMovement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So y increases up, decreases down. That means (0,0) is bottom-left? Typically in grids, (0,0) is top-left, but here U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increases upwards, so (0,0) could be bottom-left. But walls are given with y=0 and y=7, so I need to be consistent.\n\nWalls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. If D is (x,y-1), that means moving down decreases y, so y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row? That might be confusing. Let me sketch this.\n\nAssume (0,0) is bottom-left corner. Then:\n\n- U (up): (x, y+1) towards higher y, so north.\n\n- D (down): (x, y-1) towards lower y, so south.\n\n- L (left): (x-1, y) west.\n\n- R (right): (x+1, y) east.\n\nWalls: x=0 (left), x=7 (right), y=0 (bottom), y=7 (top). So grid from (0,0) to (7,7) with (0,0) bottom-left, (7,7) top-right.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\nSnake: head at (2,2), body at (2,3). Head direction is down (D). Since head is at (2,2) and moving down, which is decreasing y, so from (2,2) to (2,1) would be down, but the body is at (2,3), which has higher y, so if head is at (2,2) and body at (2,3), and direction is down, that means the snake was moving down to (2,2) from (2,3)? Let's see the positions: [(2,2), (2,3)]. Since head is first, at (2,2), and tail at (2,3). If direction is down, and it was moving down, it must have come from above. From (2,3) to (2,2) is down, decreasing y, so yes, it moved down to (2,2).\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (3,5,8,1) — this should be (x,y, life_span, value). Format is (x, y, life_span, value). Value 1 is positive food, since +1.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3,8,1) positive food.\n\n(6,4,9,1) positive food.\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, so all good to eat.\n\nLife spans: 8,8,9 turns respectively, including current turn? \"Life-span disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\" So at turn t=2, life_span is given, so for (3,5), life_span=8, meaning it will disappear after 8 more turns? Or including current turn?\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\". I think \"after N turns\" means it will be gone at the beginning of turn t+N or something. Let's clarify.\n\nSuppose at turn t, a food has life_span L. Then on turn t, countdown is L, and it decreases each turn, so after turn t, it becomes L-1, and so on, until countdown 0, it disappears. But when does it disappear? After the turn when countdown reaches 0, I think.\n\nBut for movement, we need to know if food is present when the head moves.\n\nThe state is given at the start of turn t, before action.\n\nSo at turn t=2, food has life_span S, meaning it will be present for S more turns, including turn t. After S turns, at turn t+S, it might disappear, but since countdown decreases each turn, at turn t, countdown = S, after turn t action, it might be consumed or not, but life-span decreases regardless.\n\nThe problem says: \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"Food can be eaten if head moves onto it.\"\n\nSo at the start of turn, we have food with countdown. When the snake moves, if head lands on a food cell, it eats it, and the food is consumed. If not, the food remains, countdown decreases by 1 at the end of the turn or something.\n\nI think we should assume that at the beginning of each turn, the food countdown is updated before the action, or after?\n\nThe state input gives food with life_span at current turn t.\n\nFor example, at turn t=2, food has life_span L, so on this turn, after the action, if not eaten, countdown becomes L-1 for next turn.\n\nIf eaten, it's removed.\n\nSimilarly, when countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the turn or after.\n\nTo be precise, let's think: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" means that at the end of the turn, countdown decreases by 1 for all food not eaten.\n\nAnd if countdown reaches 0, it disappears at the end of the turn.\n\nBut for the action, when we move, if head lands on food, we eat it immediately.\n\nIn this case, at turn t=2, life_span given, so for (3,5), life_span=8, so it has 8 turns left including this one. After 8 turns, it will be gone.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, snake is at [(2,2), (2,3)], head at (2,2), direction D (down).\n\nPossible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is D, so opposite is U. So I cannot move U next, because that would be instant reverse.\n\nSo possible actions: D, L, R. Not U.\n\nNow, let's see the grid positions.\n\nFirst, let's list all blocked cells:\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7). But since it's borders, cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\nAlso, the snake itself: (2,2) and (2,3) are occupied, so I cannot move there except that moving to tail is allowed if tail moves, but since the tail is part of the body, when I move, the tail moves away, so only the head and body except tail are obstacles for collision.\n\nCollision rules: head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves when head moves.\n\nSpecifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, at the moment before moving, the snake occupies cells. When I move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves away from its position if no growth, so the cell that was tail becomes empty.\n\nIf I eat food, tail doesn't move, so the snake grows.\n\nFor collision: after moving, if the new head position is the same as any body segment except the current tail, it collides. Or if it's the tail, and tail doesn't move, but when I eat, tail doesn't move, so if head moves to tail position and eats food, it might collide if the tail is there.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn general: after moving, if head is on a food, it eats, length increases, so the tail stays, and the new head is where food was, which might cause collision if that cell was occupied or adjacent issues, but specifically, if head moves to a cell that was tail, and eats food, since food is under tail, but only if body moves away, but in this case, if tail has food and head moves to it, eating causes growth, so tail doesn't move, but the head is now on the tail cell, and since tail is still there? No.\n\nLet's clarify the food under body rule.\n\n\"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n1. The body moves away, and\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nFor example, if a food is under the tail, when the snake moves, the tail moves away, exposing the food, then if head moves onto it later, it can be eaten.\n\nBut in the \"Tail Reward Danger\" case: if head is adjacent to tail, and tail cell has positive food, if head moves to the tail cell to eat the food, then because of growth, the tail doesn't move, so the head moves to where tail was, and since tail is still there, they collide? But tail should have moved, but if it eats, tail stays.\n\nStandard snake: when head eats food, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one.\n\nSo if the head moves to a cell that was occupied by the tail, and that cell has food, but when the snake moves, first the head moves to new position, then if it eats food, the tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is added at head? No.\n\nSequence:\n\n- At start, snake has positions: [head, body, ..., tail]\n\n- I choose a direction to move.\n\n- The head moves to a new cell.\n\n- If the new cell has food, the snake eats it, so the tail does not move, and the snake grows: the new head position is added, and tail remains, so length increases by one.\n\n- If no food, the tail moves to the previous position, so the snake moves forward, length same.\n\n- Collision: after head moves, if the new head position is a wall or a body segment (including if it was the tail but tail didn't move), it collides.\n\nSpecifically for body: if new head position is the same as any body segment except that if it was the tail and we didn't eat, tail moves so it's not there, but if we eat, tail stays.\n\nIn \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail, and tail cell has food, if head moves to tail cell, it eats the food, but since tail is still there (because we eat, tail doesn't move), so head and tail are on the same cell, which is collision.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlso, if new head position is any other body part, collision.\n\nOr wall.\n\nNow back to current state.\n\nSnake: head (2,2), tail (2,3). Only two segments.\n\nHead direction D.\n\nPossible moves: not U (opposite), so D, L, R.\n\nNow, what are the new positions:\n\n- If move D (down): to (2,1) since D is (x,y-1), y decreases.\n\n(2,1): is it valid? y=1, not wall, since walls y=0 is bottom, so y=1 is ok. x=2, not wall.\n\nInternal obstacles: (2,1) not in list: obstacles are (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (2,1) not there.\n\nSnake body: only (2,3), not (2,1), so no collision.\n\nIf move to (2,1), no food there, so tail moves: new positions: head (2,1), tail (2,2)? After move: head to (2,1), since no food, tail moves from (2,3) to where? The body follows: since only two segments, new head (2,1), and the body becomes the previous head (2,2), so snake becomes [(2,1), (2,2)].\n\nTail was (2,3), but since no growth, tail moves away, so (2,3) is free now.\n\nSimilarly, if move L: left to (1,2)\n\n(1,2): x=1, y=2. Walls: x=0 is wall, but x=1 is not border wall. Internal obstacles: (1,4) is obstacle, but (1,2) not in obstacles. Snake body (2,3) not there. So ok.\n\nIf move R: right to (3,2)\n\n(3,2): x=3,y=2, not wall, not obstacle, not snake body.\n\nNow, food positions: (3,5), (4,3), (6,4)\n\nNone of these are near (2,2) directly.\n\n(4,3) is at y=3, but head at y=2.\n\nI need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, life spans: all food has life_span 8 or 9, at turn 2, so they last many turns, no immediate danger of disappearing.\n\nBut I need to maximize score by eating food while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nI should sketch a grid.\n\nAssume (0,0) bottom-left, (7,7) top-right.\n\ny=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nx=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nWalls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so we cannot go there.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n(2,4) is an obstacle, which is above the snake.\n\nSnake at (2,2) and (2,3). (2,3) is body, but since tail, it can move.\n\nHead at (2,2), direction down.\n\nFood:\n\n- (3,5): x=3,y=5\n\n- (4,3): x=4,y=3\n\n- (6,4): x=6,y=4\n\nNow, life_span: (3,5):8, (4,3):8, (6,4):9 at turn 2.\n\nSince countdown includes current turn, after this turn, if not eaten, life_span decreases to 7,6,8 respectively? At turn t=2, life_span L means it has L turns left including this one.\n\nAfter turn t=2, if not eaten, at turn t=3, life_span will be L-1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut since L=8 or 9, plenty of time.\n\nNow, I need to choose a move for turn 2.\n\nPossible actions: D, L, R (not U).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option for one move, but I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nSince the snake is short, I can explore paths to food.\n\nFirst, to eat (4,3): it's at (4,3), head at (2,2). So I need to go right and up or something.\n\n(4,3) is at y=3, x=4.\n\nFrom (2,2), to reach (4,3), I need to increase x and y.\n\nBut direction down, so if I move R to (3,2), then from there, I can go U to (3,3), then R to (4,3), but (4,3) has food, so if I go to (4,3) on turn 4 or something.\n\nLet's plan a sequence.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) is at (3,5), which is up.\n\n(6,4) is far.\n\nAlso, obstacles: (2,4) is blocked, so I cannot go directly up to y=4 at x=2.\n\nFrom (2,2), if I move U, but I cannot because instant reverse? Current direction D, moving U is opposite, so not allowed. So I cannot move up immediately.\n\nSo only D, L, R.\n\nNow, move D to (2,1): then snake at [(2,1), (2,2)]\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move L, R, or U (since direction now down, but after moving D, head at (2,1), direction is D, so next move can be L, R, D? Or U?\n\nDirection: after moving, the new direction is the move I just made.\n\nAfter I move D, the head is at (2,1), and I moved down, so current direction is down.\n\nThen for next turn, I can move L, R, or D, not U (opposite).\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (1,2), direction left, then can move L, U, D, not R.\n\nIf move R to (3,2), direction right, then can move R, U, D, not L.\n\nNow, let's think about paths to food.\n\nFirst, closest food is (4,3) at (4,3), distance |4-2| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3 Manhattan.\n\n(3,5) at |3-2| + |5-2| =1 +3=4\n\n(6,4) at |6-2| + |4-2| =4+2=6\n\nSo (4,3) is closest.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nPath to (4,3): from (2,2), if I move R to (3,2), then from (3,2), I can move U to (3,3), then R to (4,3). But (4,3) has food, so on turn 4, I can eat it if I go that way.\n\nBut need to check if cells are free.\n\n(3,2): not wall, not obstacle, and after move, snake at [(3,2), (2,2)]? After moving to (3,2), head to (3,2), no food there (food at (3,5), etc, not (3,2)), so tail moves, snake becomes [(3,2), (2,2)] with tail at (2,2).\n\nThen from (3,2), move U to (3,3): (3,3) is free? Obstacles: (1,4),(2,4),(4,4),(5,6),(6,3), not (3,3). Walls no. Snake body: (2,2) is body, not (3,3). So ok.\n\nThen from (3,3), move R to (4,3): (4,3) has food, so I eat it, snake grows to length 3, positions: head to (4,3), body (3,3), and tail (2,2)? After moving to (4,3), since food, tail doesn't move, so snake was [(3,3), (2,2)] before move? Before moving from (3,3), snake is at [(3,3), (2,2)], head (3,3).\n\nMove to (4,3), eat food, so new head (4,3), and tail stays, so body is (3,3) and (2,2), so snake: [(4,3), (3,3), (2,2)]\n\nLength 3.\n\nNow, that seems fine.\n\nBut I need to start from turn 2.\n\nIf I move R on turn 2 to (3,2), then turn 3 move U to (3,3), turn 4 move R to (4,3) and eat.\n\nThat's 3 turns to eat (4,3).\n\nSimilarly, I could go other ways.\n\nBut what about the other food.\n\n(3,5) at (3,5), which is above.\n\nFrom (2,2), if I could go up, but I can't directly.\n\nIf I move L or D, it might take longer.\n\nBut (4,3) is closer.\n\nNow, move D to (2,1): then at (2,1), I can move L, R, or D.\n\nSay move R to (3,1), then U to (3,2), etc, but to (4,3) it might take more turns.\n\nSimilarly, move L to (1,2): then I can go U to (1,3), but (1,3) is free? Obstacles: (1,4) is obstacle, but (1,3) not, so ok. Then to (1,4) is obstacle, cannot go, so I have to go right or down, but then to reach (4,3) it's longer.\n\nSo moving R to (3,2) seems best for short term to (4,3).\n\nBut there is another food at (3,5), which might be eaten later.\n\nAlso, (6,4) is there.\n\nBut I need to consider risks.\n\nFor example, after eating (4,3), snake at (4,3), (3,3), (2,2)\n\nThen I need to move somewhere.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there is obstacle at (4,4) and (2,4), etc.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger, but no food under tail now.\n\nAll food is on free cells.\n\nNow, for turn 2, if I move R to (3,2), as above.\n\nBut let's see if I can avoid dead ends.\n\nSince I need to think long term, I should consider the grid and possible paths.\n\nList all blocked cells:\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), (5,6), (6,3)\n\nSnake: (2,2), (2,3) — (2,3) is occupied but will move if no eat.\n\nNow, free cells: for example, row y=1: x=1 to 6 except no obstacles listed, so all free except walls.\n\nSimilarly y=2: x=1,3,4,5,6 free? x=2 has snake head and body, but after move, it changes.\n\nBut for pathing, I can consider the grid.\n\nSince snake is short, I can simulate.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns? No, the answer should be a sequence of actions starting from turn 2.\n\nThe instruction says: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output actions for the turns as specified.\n\n\"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\"\n\nBut it doesn't say how many turns to output. I think I need to provide a sequence for the next few turns, but since it's ongoing, probably until a decision point or something, but I think for now, I should provide a sequence that gets me to food or safe.\n\nBut the problem is to maximize score, so I should aim to eat food.\n\nAlso, prioritize survival.\n\nIn this case, moving to (4,3) seems good.\n\nBut let's check the move to (3,2) on turn 2.\n\nIs (3,2) safe? Yes.\n\nThen turn 3, from (3,2), direction right (since I moved R to get there).\n\nAfter moving R to (3,2), head at (3,2), direction R.\n\nThen I can move U, D, or R (not L, opposite).\n\nI want to move U to (3,3), which is safe.\n\nThen turn 4, from (3,3), direction U (since moved U), so can move U, L, R (not D).\n\nThen move R to (4,3), eat food.\n\nNow, after that, on turn 5, snake at (4,3), (3,3), (2,2)\n\nHead at (4,3), direction R (since I moved R to get there).\n\nNow, where to go? I need to avoid collisions and eat more food.\n\nPossible moves: from (4,3), can go U, D, R (not L, opposite).\n\nU to (4,4): but (4,4) is an obstacle! (4,4) is internal obstacle, cannot go.\n\nD to (4,2): (4,2) should be free. Obstacles not there, walls no.\n\nR to (5,3): (5,3) free? Internal obstacles: (5,6) is there, (6,3) is obstacle, but (5,3) not listed, so free.\n\nNow, if I go D to (4,2), then from there, I can go to other areas.\n\nOr R to (5,3).\n\nBut there is food at (3,5) and (6,4).\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), which is left and up from (4,3).\n\nBut from (4,3), I cannot go L directly because direction R, opposite L not allowed.\n\nSo only U, D, R, but U to (4,4) blocked.\n\nSo only D or R.\n\nIf go D to (4,2), then head at (4,2), direction D.\n\nThen I can go L, R, D (not U).\n\nFrom (4,2), I can go L to (3,2) or R to (5,2) or D to (4,1).\n\n(3,2) might be body? Snake positions: after eating at (4,3), snake is [(4,3), (3,3), (2,2)]\n\nSo (3,3) and (2,2) are body.\n\n(3,2) is not occupied, so I can go to (3,2).\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) free.\n\nThen I can go towards (3,5) or (6,4).\n\n(3,5): from (4,2), go L to (3,2), then U to (3,3), but (3,3) is part of the snake body! After turn 4, snake has (3,3) as body segment.\n\nAt turn 4 end: snake at [(4,3), (3,3), (2,2)]\n\nSo (3,3) is occupied.\n\nIf from (4,2) on turn 5, I go L to (3,2), which is free.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can go U to (3,3), but (3,3) is body, so collision if I move there.\n\nCannot go to (3,3).\n\nFrom (3,2), I can go L to (2,2), but (2,2) is tail, but let's see.\n\n(2,2) is part of snake, occupied.\n\nAfter moving to (3,2), if no eat, tail moves.\n\nBut let's sequence.\n\nOn turn 5, from (4,3), I move D to (4,2).\n\nNo food at (4,2), so tail moves: the tail was (2,2), moves to where? The body: head to (4,2), body becomes (4,3) and (3,3), tail (2,2) moves away, so snake now [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3)]\n\nTail at (3,3)? Positions: after move, head to (4,2), no eat, so tail removed? Standard: the tail cell is vacated, and the new tail is the second last segment.\n\nSnake was [(4,3), (3,3), (2,2)]\n\nMove head to (4,2), no food, so new head (4,2), and the body shifts: the segment that was at (3,3) moves to (4,3)? No.\n\nThe body follows: the head moves to new position, and each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo positions: head was (4,3), moves to (4,2).\n\nThe body segment that was at (3,3) moves to (4,3), which was head position.\n\nThe tail segment at (2,2) moves to (3,3).\n\nSo new snake: [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3)]\n\nHead (4,2), body (4,3) and (3,3), tail at (3,3)? (3,3) is position, but it's the tail segment.\n\nNow, (3,3) is occupied by tail.\n\nFrom here, if I want to go to (3,5), I need to go up.\n\nBut from (4,2), I can move U, but direction is D (since I moved down to (4,2)), so opposite U not allowed? Direction: I moved D to (4,2), so current direction down.\n\nThen next move, cannot move U, only L, R, D.\n\nMove L to (3,2): (3,2) is free, as above.\n\nThen snake moves: head to (3,2), no food, tail moves: new head (3,2), body: (4,2) moves to? Head was (4,2) to (3,2), body segment (4,3) moves to (4,2), tail (3,3) moves to (4,3).\n\nNew snake: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,3)]\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move, direction left (since moved L), so can move L, U, D (not R).\n\nL to (2,2): but (2,2) might be free? In current state, (2,2) is not occupied, but in this position, from [(3,2), (4,2), (4,3)], (2,2) is free.\n\nMove to (2,2), then from there, I can go up, but (2,3) and (2,4) obstacle.\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, so from (2,2), I can go U to (2,3), but (2,3) is where? In this snake, (2,3) not occupied, but (2,4) is obstacle, so (2,3) is free? Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,3) not listed, so free.\n\nBut if I go U to (2,3), then from (2,3), I can go to (2,4) but it's obstacle, cannot, or to (1,3) or (3,3).\n\nBut (3,3) is occupied? In current snake, after moving to (2,2), let's not digress.\n\nBack to after eating (4,3), at (4,3) with direction R, on turn 5, I have to move D or R.\n\nIf I move R to (5,3) instead of D.\n\n(5,3) is free, no food.\n\nThen move to (5,3), no eat, so snake: was [(4,3), (3,3), (2,2)], head to (5,3), body: (3,3) to (4,3)? Head from (4,3) to (5,3), body (3,3) moves to (4,3), tail (2,2) moves to (3,3).\n\nNew snake: [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3)]\n\nThen from (5,3), direction R, can move R, U, D (not L).\n\nR to (6,3): but (6,3) is internal obstacle! (6,3) is in the list, cannot go.\n\nU to (5,4): (5,4) free? Obstacles: (5,6) is there, but (5,4) not listed, so free.\n\nD to (5,2): free.\n\nSo I can go U to (5,4) or D to (5,2).\n\nThen from there, to (6,4) food, which is at (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is food, but (6,3) is obstacle, so (6,4) might be accessible.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can move R to (6,4), but (6,4) is at x=6,y=4.\n\nx=6, but walls x=7 is border, x=6 is not wall, but internal obstacles: (6,3) is obstacle, but (6,4) not listed, so should be free.\n\nBut (6,3) is obstacle, but (6,4) is above, so ok.\n\nIf I go to (6,4) and eat.\n\nBut let's not plan too far.\n\nBack to turn 2.\n\nIf I move to (3,2) on turn 2, I can reach (4,3) by turn 4.\n\nNow, what if I move D or L on turn 2?\n\nFor example, move D to (2,1) on turn 2.\n\nThen snake at [(2,1), (2,2)], direction D.\n\nTurn 3, from (2,1), can move L, R, D (not U).\n\nSay move R to (3,1), direction R.\n\nThen turn 4, from (3,1), can move R, U, D (not L).\n\nMove U to (3,2), then turn 5 move to (3,3), but (3,3) might be occupied later, but now not.\n\nFrom (3,2) I can go to (4,3) as before, but takes more turns.\n\nSimilarly, to reach (4,3) from here: from (3,1) move U to (3,2), then to (3,3), but (3,3) then to (4,3), same as before but one turn later because I went down first.\n\nSo worse for short term.\n\nSimilarly, move L on turn 2 to (1,2).\n\nThen from (1,2), can move L, U, D (not R, since direction L).\n\nL to (0,2), but x=0 is wall, cannot go.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nU to (1,3): (1,3) free? Obstacles: (1,4) obstacle, but (1,3) not, so ok.\n\nThen from (1,3), I can move U to (1,4), but (1,4) is obstacle, cannot.\n\nOr move R to (2,3), but (2,3) might be body, but at turn 2, after move to (1,2), snake at [(1,2), (2,2)], so (2,2) is body.\n\n(2,3) was tail, but moved? After moving to (1,2), no eat, tail moves, so snake [(1,2), (2,2)], tail at (2,2).\n\n(2,3) is free now.\n\nFrom (1,3), if I move to (1,4) cannot, or to (2,3) or (1,2) but (1,2) is body.\n\nFrom (1,3), move to (2,3): (2,3) is free, as above.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move to (2,4) but obstacle, or (3,3) or (1,3) but (1,3) is previous.\n\nDirection: from (1,3) to (2,3) is move R, so direction right.\n\nThen can move U, D, R (not L).\n\nU to (2,4) obstacle, cannot.\n\nD to (2,2), but (2,2) may be occupied.\n\nIn this path, at some point, it might be messy.\n\nBut to reach (4,3), it takes more turns from left.\n\nSo moving R on turn 2 is better.\n\nNow, about the other food (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), which is above.\n\nTo eat it, I need to go up.\n\nBut from current position, I cannot go up directly.\n\nAfter eating (4,3), I might go towards it.\n\nBut from (4,3), I cannot go left directly.\n\nPerhaps I can go to (3,5) first? But it's farther.\n\n|3-2| + |5-2| =1+3=4, while (4,3) is 2+1=3.\n\nAlso, to reach (3,5), from (2,2), I need to go to x=3, y=5.\n\nBut at (2,2), cannot go U.\n\nIf I move R to (3,2), then U to (3,3), then U to (3,4), then U to (3,5).\n\nBut (3,4) free? Obstacles: (2,4) obstacle, (4,4) obstacle, but (3,4) not listed, so free.\n\nThen from (3,3) to (3,4) to (3,5).\n\nBut when I go to (3,5), eat food.\n\nSequence: turn 2 move R to (3,2)\n\nTurn 3 move U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 4 move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 5 move U to (3,5) eat.\n\nBut on turn 4, I go to (3,4), which is fine, but I don't eat until turn 5.\n\nWhereas if I go to (4,3), I eat on turn 4.\n\n(4,3) on turn 4 vs (3,5) on turn 5, but (4,3) is closer initially.\n\nMoreover, after eating (4,3), I can still go to (3,5) or other.\n\nBut from (4,3), as before, I have limited moves.\n\nAnother option: from (2,2), move R to (3,2) turn 2.\n\nThen instead of U, I could move R to (4,2) on turn 3.\n\nBut (4,2) has no food, then from (4,2), move U to (4,3) to eat on turn 4? Turn 3 move to (4,2), then turn 4 move U to (4,3) eat.\n\nBut from (3,2) to (4,2) is move R, then to (4,3) is move U.\n\nBut when I move U to (4,3), direction from R to U, which is allowed.\n\nBut same as before, eat on turn 4.\n\nIf I go directly to (4,3) via (3,3) as first plan.\n\nIn terms of turns, same.\n\nBut via (3,3) I can potentially go to (3,5) later.\n\nNow, about the life spans: all food has high life, so no issue.\n\nBut there is a food at (6,4) with life_span 9, so later.\n\nNow, I need to avoid risks.\n\nFor example, after eating (4,3), if I go to (5,3), then I might be blocked.\n\nBut let's think about the grid with obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), (5,6), (6,3)\n\n(4,4) blocked, so from (4,3), I cannot go up.\n\n(2,4) blocked, so from (2,3) cannot go up.\n\n(6,3) blocked, so from (6,4) or below cannot go down? (6,3) is at y=3, so if at (6,4), going down to (6,3) blocked.\n\nBut (6,4) is food, so if I go to eat it, after eating, I need to move.\n\nBut let's not worry now.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger, but no food under snake now.\n\nSo for turn 2, moving R seems best.\n\nBut let's confirm the direction.\n\nCurrent head direction D, moving R is right, which is not opposite, so allowed.\n\nMove to (3,2).\n\nThen for turn 3, from (3,2), direction R, I can move U to (3,3) as planned.\n\nThen turn 4 to (4,3) eat.\n\nNow, for turn 5, after eating, snake at (4,3), (3,3), (2,2) with head direction R.\n\nThen as before, I can move D to (4,2) or R to (5,3).\n\nIf I move D to (4,2), then as before.\n\nBut to think long term, I should aim for (3,5) or (6,4).\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), which is left and up.\n\nBut from (4,3), I cannot go left directly.\n\nSo if I move D to (4,2), then from (4,2) direction D, I can move L to (3,2) or R to (5,2) or D to (4,1).\n\nIf I move L to (3,2), then from (3,2) direction L, I can move L to (2,2), but (2,2) may be occupied or not.\n\nAt that point, after moving to (3,2), snake is [(3,2), (4,2), (4,3)] or something.\n\nEarlier: after move to (4,2) on turn 5, no eat, snake becomes [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3)]\n\nThen move L to (3,2) on turn 6, head to (3,2), no food, snake: head (3,2), body (4,2) moves to (4,2)? Head from (4,2) to (3,2), body (4,3) moves to (4,2), tail (3,3) moves to (4,3)? New snake: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,3)]\n\nTail at (4,3).\n\nThen from (3,2), direction L, can move L, U, D.\n\nL to (2,2): (2,2) free, move to (2,2), no food, snake: head (2,2), body (3,2) moves to (3,2), tail (4,2) moves to (4,2)? New: [(2,2), (3,2), (4,3)]? Let's: positions after move: head to (2,2), no eat, so body: segment that was at (3,2) moves to previous head position? Head was (3,2) to (2,2), so body segment that was at (4,2) moves to (3,2), and tail that was at (4,3) moves to (4,2)? Snake before move: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,3)]\n\nAfter move head to (2,2), no eat, so new head (2,2), then the segment that was at (4,2) moves to (3,2), and the segment that was at (4,3) moves to (4,2). Since (4,3) was tail, it moves to (4,2), which is the new position of the previous segment.\n\nNew snake: [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2)]\n\nAll in a row.\n\nThen from (2,2), I can move U, but (2,3) free? But (2,4) obstacle, so if move U to (2,3), then from (2,3), I can only move left or right or down, cannot go up to (2,4).\n\nSo I can move to (1,3) or (3,3).\n\n(3,3) may be free or not.\n\nBut I can go towards (3,5) by moving to (3,3) etc.\n\nBut it's getting complicated.\n\nTo save time, for now, moving R on turn 2 is fine.\n\nThen I can output the sequence for a few turns.\n\nThe answer should include multiple turns, but it doesn't specify how many.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide a sequence for 5 turns or so.\n\nStart from turn 2.\n\nTurn 2: move R to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 3: from (3,2), move U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 4: from (3,3), move R to (4,3) and eat.\n\nNow turn 5: from (4,3), head direction R, cannot go L or U (U blocked), so move D to (4,2) or R to (5,3).\n\nLet's choose to go towards (3,5) or (6,4).\n\n(3,5) is closer in terms of y, but x same.\n\nFrom (4,3), if I move D to (4,2), then I can go left.\n\nBut let's see (6,4), which has life_span 9, longer, but (3,5) has life_span 8, at turn 2, so after 8 turns, it disappears at turn 10 or something.\n\nCurrent turn 2, life_span 8, so after turn 2, if not eaten, at turn 3 life_span 7, ..., after turn 9, it might be gone.\n\nAt turn t, food has life_span L, so it can be eaten on turn t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at the end of turn t+L-1 or beginning of turn t+L.\n\nBut for safety, it can be eaten as long as life_span >0 when we land on it.\n\nAt turn 2, (3,5) life_span 8, so can be eaten up to turn 9 (since turns 2 to 9, 8 turns? From turn 2 to turn 9 is 8 actions? Turns: turn 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9: 8 turns, so life_span 8 means it lasts until after turn 9? Let's not complicate.\n\nSince life_span decreases each turn, at turn k, the remaining life is initial L minus (k - t) for k >= t.\n\nAt turn t, life_span L, at turn t+1, life_span L-1 if not eaten, etc.\n\nSo (3,5) at turn 2: life_span 8, so at turn 5, life_span 5, still there.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) life_span 9 at turn 2, at turn 5, 6, etc.\n\nNo immediate risk.\n\nFor turn 5, from (4,3), I can move R to (5,3) to go towards (6,4).\n\nThen from (5,3), I can move U to (5,4), then R to (6,4) to eat.\n\n(6,4) food.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: R (eat at (4,3))\n\nTurn 5: R (to (5,3))\n\nTurn 6: U (to (5,4))\n\nTurn 7: R (to (6,4) eat)\n\nBut on turn 6, from (5,3) move U to (5,4), then turn 7 to (6,4).\n\n(5,4) is free, (6,4) free except (6,3) obstacle but not same cell.\n\nAnd (6,4) has food, so eat on turn 7.\n\nMeanwhile, (3,5) might expire, but it's ok.\n\nI could go to (3,5) after turn 4.\n\nAfter turn 4, snake at (4,3), (3,3), (2,2), head at (4,3) dir R.\n\nTurn 5, move D to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 6, from (4,2) dir D, move L to (3,2)\n\nTurn 7, from (3,2) dir L, move U to (3,3) but (3,3) is body? At that point, snake positions.\n\nAfter turn 5: move to (4,2), no eat, snake [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3)]\n\nTurn 6: move L to (3,2), head to (3,2), no food (assume), so snake: head (3,2), body (4,2) moves to (4,2)? Head from (4,2) to (3,2), body (4,3) moves to (4,2), tail (3,3) moves to (4,3)? New: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,3)]\n\nTail at (4,3).\n\nThen turn 7: move U to (3,3), but (3,3) is not occupied now? Positions: (3,3) is free? In the snake, cells occupied: (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), so (3,3) free.\n\nMove to (3,3), no food, so snake: head to (3,3), body (3,2) moves to (3,2)? Head from (3,2) to (3,3), body (4,2) moves to (3,2), tail (4,3) moves to (4,2)? New: [(3,3), (3,2), (4,2)]\n\nNow, from (3,3), I can move U to (3,4), then to (3,5) on turn 9.\n\nBut (3,5) life_span: at turn 2,8, turn 7 is 5 turns later, life_span 3, turn 8:2, turn 9:1, so can eat on turn 9.\n\nBut longer.\n\nFirst sequence to (6,4) is shorter.\n\nI think for now, I'll go with the first sequence to eat (4,3) then (6,4).\n\nBut in the sequence, I need to output actions.\n\nAlso, for turn 2, I think R is good.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nSo for turn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: U (to (3,3))\n\nBut on turn 3, from (3,2), I move U to (3,3), which is fine.\n\nThen turn 4: R to (4,3) eat.\n\nThen turn 5: R to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 6: U to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 7: R to (6,4) eat.\n\nBut I need to specify only up to where? The format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but no end, but I think for a few turns.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", output 5 actions or so.\n\nFrom turn 2 to turn 6, that's 5 turns: t2,t3,t4,t5,t6.\n\nt2 to t6 is 5 actions.\n\nt2, t3, t4, t5, t6: five turns.\n\nThen I can stop.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 4 I eat, turn 7 eat another, but turn 7 is beyond.\n\nFor the answer, I'll provide turns 2 to 6.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: R\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nBut on turn 6, from (5,3) move U to (5,4), which is part of going to (6,4).\n\nNow, is there any risk?\n\nFor example, on turn 5, moving to (5,3), is it safe? Yes.\n\nThen U to (5,4), safe.\n\nThen later R to (6,4).\n\nBut (6,4) has food, and after eating, I might be at (6,4) with body, and (6,3) below is obstacle, so I can go up or right, but right to (7,4) is wall, x=7 wall, cannot. So only up or left or down, but down to (6,3) obstacle, so only up to (6,5) or left to (5,4) or (5,5), etc.\n\nBut that's later.\n\nFor now, the sequence seems ok.\n\nI could consider going to (3,5) but it takes longer.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (3,5) might be eaten if I go that way, but with the obstacles, it might be harder.\n\nFor example, to go to (3,5) from start, I need to go up, but from (2,2) cannot, so must go right or left first.\n\nThen as before.\n\nBut (3,5) is surrounded? (3,5) has neighbors: (3,4), (3,6), (2,5), (4,5).\n\n(3,4) should be free, (3,6): y=6, not wall, (2,5) free, (4,5) free except obstacles not there.\n\nBut (2,4) and (4,4) obstacles, so (2,5) and (4,5) are ok.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut in my sequence, I'm not going there first.\n\nSince all food positive, eating any is good.\n\nBut (4,3) is closest, so I think it's fine.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the AI must plan at least 5 turns ahead, considering the snake's current position, direction, food locations with life spans, and obstacles. The current state at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) is:\n\n- **Grid**: 8x8 with walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (borders) and internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n- **Snake**: Head at (2,2) with direction D (down), body at (2,3), length 2.\n- **Food**: \n  - (3,5) with value +1, life span 8 (disappears after turn 9).\n  - (4,3) with value +1, life span 8 (disappears after turn 9).\n  - (6,4) with value +1, life span 9 (disappears after turn 10).\n\n### Analysis for 5+ Turns Ahead:\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 2)**: Current direction is D, so instant reverse to U is forbidden. Possible moves: D (down to (2,1)), L (left to (1,2)), or R (right to (3,2)).\n- **Path to Food**: \n  - (4,3) is closest (Manhattan distance 3) and can be reached in 2 turns via R then U then R, eating on turn 4.\n  - (3,5) is farther (distance 4) and requires navigating around obstacles like (2,4).\n  - (6,4) is farthest (distance 6) but has a longer life span; it can be targeted after (4,3) for efficient scoring.\n- **Risk Avoidance**:\n  - Moving L to (1,2) risks dead ends near obstacles (e.g., (1,4)) and delays reaching food.\n  - Moving D to (2,1) is safe but suboptimal, as it adds turns to reach food and may limit future mobility.\n  - Moving R to (3,2) is optimal, enabling a quick path to (4,3) and setting up a sequence to (6,4) while avoiding obstacles. After eating (4,3), the snake grows to length 3, and moving R to (5,3) then U to (5,4) positions it to eat (6,4) on turn 7.\n  - No tail reward danger or immediate collision risks in this path; all moves are into free cells.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: \n  - Eating (4,3) on turn 4 scores +1 and increases length, improving reach for future food.\n  - Targeting (6,4) next leverages its longer life span; it can be eaten by turn 7 before expiration.\n  - (3,5) is deprioritized as it expires later (turn 9) and can be eaten if feasible after (6,4), but the chosen path avoids tight spaces near (2,4) and (4,4).\n  - The sequence ensures the snake stays away from walls and obstacles, with escape routes (e.g., after (6,4), move to (6,5) or (5,4) to avoid dead ends at (6,3) or walls).\n\n### Action Sequence for Turns 2 to 6:\n- **Turn 2 (t=2)**: Move R (right) to (3,2). This avoids instant reverse, starts the path to (4,3), and keeps options open.\n- **Turn 3 (t=3)**: Move U (up) to (3,3). From (3,2) with direction R, U is allowed and positions for the next move to (4,3).\n- **Turn 4 (t=4)**: Move R (right) to (4,3) and eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 3). Snake now at [(4,3), (3,3), (2,2)] with direction R.\n- **Turn 5 (t=5)**: Move R (right) to (5,3). From (4,3) with direction R, R is allowed and moves toward (6,4). No food at (5,3), so tail moves; snake at [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3)].\n- **Turn 6 (t=6)**: Move U (up) to (5,4). From (5,3) with direction R, U is allowed and prepares for the move to (6,4) on turn 7. (5,4) is free, and (6,4) can be eaten next turn.\n\nThis sequence eats one food by turn 4 and positions for a second by turn 7, maximizing score while ensuring survival through turn 6 and beyond.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 2\\text{: R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3\\text{: U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4\\text{: R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5\\text{: R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6\\text{: U} }",
