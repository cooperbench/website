It's turn 0, and the grid has walls and obstacles. The grid size isn't specified, but from the walls, it seems like a 8x8 grid since x and y go from 0 to 7. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 for borders, and internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: only one segment? It says [(3,3)], which is just the head. But snakes usually have multiple segments. Let me check: \"Snake Positions: [(3,3)]\" – that might be a list with one element, meaning the snake is only the head right now.

Rule: \"No instant reverse\", so I cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is L, so I cannot move R.\n> \n> So valid moves from (3,3): L to (2,3), U to (3,4), D to (3,2).\n> \n> But let's check for obstacles and walls.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (2,3) is x=2,y=3, which should be within bounds since x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 might be valid? No, borders are x=0 and x=7, meaning cells with x=0 or x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7. So for movement, I cannot go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> (1,3) and (2,3) are obstacles? (1,3) and (2,3) are listed, but (2,3) is a possible move to the left from (3,3).\n> \n> From (3,3), moving L to (2,3): but (2,3) is an internal obstacle?

(3,4) – x=3, y=4, not on border walls, and not in internal obstacles. Internal obstacles have y=6,1,3,3,6, so (3,4) should be free.\n> \n> Moving D to (3,2): (3,2) – y=2, not on border, not in obstacles.

Let's see: on turn 0, life span decreases to 9, then turn 1 to 8, ..., after turn 9, it disappears, so available for 10 turns from turn 0 to turn 9.\n> \n> Similarly for all food.\n> \n> Since life span is 10, and grid is small, I have time to reach them.\n> \n> But I need to prioritize which food to go for.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but borders walls, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive? Let's confirm: if x=0 and x=7 are walls, then cells with x=0 or x=7 cannot be occupied, similarly y=0 and y=7.\n> \n> So valid cells: x=1,2,3,4,5,6 and y=1,2,3,4,5,6.

Borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is valid, but (3,6) and (5,6) are obstacles, so (1,6) might be accessible if not blocked.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) x=5,y=5; (5,1) x=5,y=1.\n> \n> Now, from (3,3), I can only move U or D.\n> \n> If I move U to (3,4): then head at (3,4), direction U.\n> \n> From there, I can move U to (3,5), or L to (2,4), or R to (4,4), but not D (opposite).\n> \n> (3,5) is free? y=5, not obstacle, should be free.\n> \n> Then from (3,5), I can go to (3,6), but (3,6) is obstacle, so I cannot go there.

No, (2,1) blocked, so only down or right, but down to (3,0) invalid, y=0 wall, so from (3,1) only right to (4,1) or left? (2,1) blocked, so only R to (4,1), or U, but direction.\n> \n> Let's simulate both options.\n> \n> First, suppose I choose U at turn 0: move to (3,4), direction U.\n> \n> Snake positions: now [(3,4)] but since I moved, and ate no food, length still 1, positions should be [(3,4)] only.\n> \n> At turn 1, from (3,4), I can move U, L, or R.\n> \n> Say I want to go to (5,5).

Snake grows to length 2. Positions: head at (5,5), tail at (5,4)? When I move to (5,5), the tail was (5,4), but since I ate, tail stays or new segment?\n> \n> When snake eats food, length increases by one, so after eating, the tail doesn't move that turn, I think.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> And positions: when moving, head moves to new cell, and tail follows, but if ate food, tail doesn't move, so new segment added.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics.\n> \n> So at turn 3, from (5,4), move U to (5,5), which has food. So head moves to (5,5), and since ate food, the tail remains where it was, so snake positions: head (5,5), and the previous position (5,4) is now body. Since length was 1, now 2, so positions: [(5,5), (5,4)]\n> \n> Head direction now U.\n> \n> Now, I have food at (1,6) and (5,1) left, but (5,1) is below.\n> \n> Life span: at turn 0, life span 10, so decreases each turn.

(4,3) is one step left and down? From (3,4), (4,3) is right and down, but not adjacent directly. Adjacent cells are (3,5), (3,3), (2,4), (4,4). (4,3) is not adjacent to (3,4); it's diagonal or something.\n> \n> Let's list adjacent cells:\n> \n> - North: (3,5)\n> \n> - South: (3,3) but moving south is down, D, which is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> - West: (2,4)\n> \n> - East: (4,4)\n> \n> (4,3) is south-east from (3,4), but not directly adjacent; it's one step east to (4,4) then south, or south to (3,3) then east, etc. But directly, from (3,4), I can only move to (3,5), (2,4), or (4,4) since D is invalid.\n> \n> (4,3) is not reachable in one move.\n> \n> Food at (5,5), (1,6), (5,1), (4,3).\n> \n> (4,3) is close, at (4,3), which is south of (4,4) or west of (5,3), etc. But from current position, I need to go towards it.\n> \n> Since the snake is short, eating food increases length, which is good for score, but I need to avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's think about immediate moves.\n> \n> Turn 1: I can go U to (3,5), L to (2,4), or R to (4,4).\n> \n> Now, food at (4,3) is very close.

Let's see how movement works.\n> \n> When I move, if I don't eat, the tail moves, but since no tail, moving to a new cell just moves head.\n> \n> Current state: snake is only head at (3,4).\n> \n> If I move to a cell without food, head moves, no tail, so snake is still length 1 at new position.\n> \n> If I move to a cell with food, I eat it, head moves to that cell, and since I eat, length increases by 1, so new tail is created at the previous head position?

The body segments shift: the segment that was at (4,4) moves to where the head was, which is (4,3), so new positions: head at (4,2), body at (4,3).\n> \n> So the tail is now at (4,3).\n> \n> If I move to a cell with food, head moves there, and since I eat, the tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added at the tail position, so length increases.\n> \n> For example, if at turn 3 I move to (4,2) and it has food, then head to (4,2), body still at (4,3), and new segment added at tail, so positions: head (4,2), body (4,3), and tail (4,4)? No.\n> \n> After eating at turn 2: segments [head: (4,3), body: (4,4)]\n> \n> If at turn 3 I move to a new cell and eat, head to new cell, say (4,2), and since I eat, I grow, so the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head at (4,2), body at (4,3), and the previous tail (4,4) stays, but since I grow, a new segment is added at the tail position, so positions become [ (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) ] with head (4,2), tail (4,4).\n> \n> The body segments include all except head.\n> \n> Generally: when moving, head moves to new cell.

Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So the grid is 8x8, but cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except for obstacles.\n> \n> Snake positions: only one segment? [(4,4)] That means the snake is just the head at (4,4), no body segments yet. Because it says \"head first, body segments follow\", but here it's only one position, so length 1 snake.\n> \n> Snake head direction: R (right), so it was moving right to get to (4,4).\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (5,5) with life span 8, value +1\n> \n> - (1,6) with life span 8, value +1\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 8, value +1\n> \n> - (4,3) with life span 9, value +1\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for all, and life span decreases each turn.\n> \n> Since the snake has only one segment, there's no body to collide with except itself, but with length 1, moving into the same cell isn't possible since it moves away. Also, tail reward danger: since there's no tail yet, it shouldn't be an issue.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, possible moves from (4,4): I can go U (up to (4,5)), D (down to (4,3)), L (left to (3,4)), R (right to (5,4)).\n> \n> But I have to consider the direction: current head direction is R, so I cannot instantly reverse to L. So L is not allowed because it's opposite to R. So possible actions: U, D, R.\n> \n> Cannot go L because no instant reverse.\n> \n> Now, let's see what's around:\n> \n> - Up: (4,5) – is this safe? Not a wall, not an obstacle. Walls are at borders, so (4,5) should be within bounds. x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's define the grid.\n> \n> Border walls: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? For example, (4,5): x=4, y=5, 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6, yes. Obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So (4,5) is not an obstacle.\n> \n> Down: (4,3) – there is food at (4,3) with value +1, life span 9. But (4,3) is the cell below, and it has food.\n> \n> Right: (5,4) – should be empty, no food mentioned there.\n> \n> Left: (3,4) – not possible because instant reverse not allowed.\n> \n> Also, (4,3) has food, so if I go down, I eat it immediately.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> First, if I go down to (4,3), I eat the food, so my snake grows to length 2. New positions: head at (4,3), and tail at previous head, which was (4,4), but since it grows, the body segments are added. When you eat food, the snake grows, so after moving to (4,3) and eating, the snake becomes [(4,3), (4,4)] with length 2. Head direction would be D (down) since I moved down.\n> \n> Then on next turn, I can move from there.\n> \n> But life span: food at (4,3) has life span 9, and current turn is 2, so it has 9 turns left, but since I eat it this turn, life span doesn't matter once eaten.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, other food: (5,5), (1,6), (5,1), all with life span 8, meaning they disappear after turn 2 + 8 = turn 10? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 2, life span 8 means it will disappear after 8 more turns, so on turn 10 it might be gone? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it exists for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, at turn 2, life span 8: exists on turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 (that's 8 turns: from 2 to 9 inclusive is 8 turns? Turn 2 to turn 9 is 8 turns: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Then disappears on turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, life span 9 at (4,3): exists from turn 2 to turn 10, disappears turn 11.\n> \n> Turn 2 + life_span - 1 = last turn it exists. For life_span L, it exists for L turns starting from current turn.\n> \n> So for (4,3): life_span 9 at turn 2, so exists until turn 10 (since turn 2 to 10 is 9 turns: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10? That's 9 turns: indices 2 to 10 inclusive is 9 units? Better to think: from turn t to t + L - 1 it exists, disappears at turn t + L.\n> \n> At turn t, with life_span L, it exists on turns: t, t+1, ..., t+L-1. Disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> So for (4,3) at turn 2, L=9, exists turns 2 to 10, disappears turn 11.\n> \n> Similarly, other food with L=8: exists turns 2 to 9, disappears turn 10.\n> \n> Now back to actions.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,4): U to (4,5), D to (4,3), R to (5,4).\n> \n> If I go D to (4,3), I eat the food there, snake grows to length 2, positions [(4,3), (4,4)], head direction D.\n> \n> Then from there, I can move U, L, R? But direction is D, so cannot go U (up, opposite), so can go L to (3,3), R to (5,3), or D to (4,2).\n> \n> (4,2) might be out of bound? y=2, min y=1, so (4,2) is y=2, which should be playable? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are playable. (4,2): x=4, y=2, 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6, yes. But obstacles: (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (3,6), (5,6). (4,2) not an obstacle.\n> \n> But if I go D to (4,3) and eat, then snake is at (4,3) and (4,4).\n> \n> Now, what about other food: (5,5) is at (5,5), which is northeast, (1,6) northwest, (5,1) southeast.\n> \n> I need to plan a path to get multiple foods while avoiding dead ends.\n> \n> Since snake is short, I have more flexibility.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: but with length 1, no tail, so not an issue. When I grow, it might be.\n> \n> But currently, no danger.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the grid layout.\n> \n> List all obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> And borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 walls, so playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> (1,3) and (2,3) are at left, (2,1) bottom left, (3,6) top middle, (5,6) top right.\n> \n> (3,6) and (5,6) are at y=6, which is near top.\n> \n> y=6 is one below y=7 wall.\n> \n> Similarly, x=1,2, etc.\n> \n> Now, food locations:\n> \n> - (5,5): top right area\n> \n> - (1,6): top left, near (1,3) obstacle?

Let's track.\n> \n> Start turn 2: snake at [(4,4)]\n> \n> Move D to (4,3): eat food, so new head (4,3), and since growth, tail stays, so positions: [(4,3), (4,4)]\n> \n> Turn 3: move R to (5,3): head moves to (5,3), body segments follow: the body at (4,3) moves to where head was? Standard snake: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So from positions: head at (4,3), body at (4,4)\n> \n> After move R to (5,3): head now at (5,3), the body segment that was at (4,3) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> The body segment that was behind moves to the position that the head left, but since it was only one body segment at (4,4), when head moves to (5,3), the body at (4,4) moves to the previous head position (4,3), so new positions: head (5,3), body (4,3). So snake at [(5,3), (4,3)].\n> \n> Length 2.\n> \n> Then turn 4: from (5,3), direction R (since moved right), I can move to (5,4) U, (5,2) D, or (6,3) R. Cannot L to (4,3) opposite.\n> \n> I want to go to (5,1), so move D to (5,2).\n> \n> Turn 4: move D to (5,2), head now (5,2), body from (4,3) moves to (5,3)? Positions: head was (5,3), body at (4,3)\n> \n> After move down to (5,2): head to (5,2), body at (4,3) moves to previous head position (5,3), so snake [(5,2), (5,3)]\n> \n> Direction now D.\n> \n> Then turn 5: move D to (5,1), eat food at (5,1), so grow, head at (5,1), body segments: the one at (5,3) moves to (5,2), and new tail added? When you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows before moving or after?\n> \n> Standard rule: when you move to a food cell, you eat it, and the snake grows, so the tail remains in place, and a new segment is added at the tail.\n> \n> So after moving to food, the head is at food position, and the tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, turn 5: from [(5,2), (5,3)], move D to (5,1), which has food, so eat it, head now at (5,1), and since growth, the tail doesn't move, so the body at (5,3) stays, but moves to the next position.\n> \n> Let's clarify movement:\n> \n> - If no food: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> - If food: head moves to new cell, eats food, the tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the tail position, effectively the snake grows by one.\n> \n> In positions: before move, snake at positions S.\n> \n> After move to empty cell: new head at new position, each subsequent segment at previous position of the segment before it, so the last segment (tail) is removed from its old position.\n> \n> After move to food cell: new head at new position, each subsequent segment at previous position, but since growth, the tail position is not vacated, so the segment that was tail is still there, and a new segment is added at that position? No.\n> \n> Typically: when eating, the head moves to food, the body moves as usual, but the tail doesn't advance, so the last position is kept, meaning the snake gains one segment.\n> \n> For example, snake at [A, B] (A head, B tail)\n> \n> Move to food at C: head moves to C, B moves to A, and since growth, a new segment is added at B, so snake becomes [C, A, B]\n> \n> If no growth: move to empty D: head to D, B to A, snake [D, A]\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> Turn 5 start: snake at [(5,2), (5,3)] with (5,2) head.\n> \n> Move D to (5,1): (5,1) has food, so eat, head now (5,1), the body segment that was at (5,3) moves to the previous head position (5,2), and since growth, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, which was (5,3)? Let's not confuse.\n> \n> Positions before move: head H at (5,2), tail T at (5,3)\n> \n> After move: head moves to (5,1), the segment that was at H moves to where? The body segment that was at the first body position moves to the old head position.\n> \n> Since there is only one body segment, it moves to the old head position (5,2).\n> \n> But since growth, the tail does not move, so the position (5,3) is still occupied by the new tail.\n> \n> After eating: new head at (5,1), the body segment that was behind head is now at the old head position (5,2), and the old tail position (5,3) has a new segment added, so snake is now [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3)]\n> \n> Yes, length 3.\n> \n> Similarly, in general.\n> \n> Back to point.\n> \n> In this sequence, by turn 5, I have eaten two foods: (4,3) at turn 2, (5,1) at turn 5, so score +2.\n> \n> Then I can go for other foods.\n> \n> But (5,5) and (1,6) are still there.\n> \n> (5,5) is at (5,5), which is above, from (5,1), I can go up, but there might be obstacles.\n> \n> (3,6) is obstacle at (3,6), (5,6) at (5,6), so near (5,5).\n> \n> (5,5) is at (5,5), (5,6) is obstacle, so I cannot go to (5,6), but (5,5) is fine.\n> \n> From (5,1), I can move to (5,2) but it's occupied?

It's turn 3, and the grid is 8x8 since borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls include borders and internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), and (5,6).\n> \n> The snake has only two segments: head at (4,3) and tail at (4,4). The head direction is down, which means it's moving towards decreasing y, so from (4,4) to (4,3) was moving down? Let me clarify the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(4,3), (4,4)] – this is head first, so head is at (4,3), and the body segment is at (4,4). Head direction is D, meaning it's facing down. But if it's at (4,3) and moving down, that would be to (4,2), but let's see the direction.\n> \n> Head direction is given as D, which is down. So from the previous position, it must have moved to (4,3) from above. Since positions are head first, [(4,3), (4,4)] means head at (4,3), tail at (4,4). Since head direction is D, it was moving down to reach (4,3), so it came from (4,4) to (4,3), which is down? (4,4) to (4,3) is decreasing y, so that is down. Yes, D means (x, y-1) for the next move? Let's check the movement.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So D is down, decreasing y.\n> \n> From the positions, head at (4,3), which was reached by moving down from (4,4), I assume. But the tail is at (4,4), so when the snake moves, the tail will also move, but since it's short, it might grow if it eats food.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (5,5) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,6) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, value 1, and life span 7, meaning they disappear after 7 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 3, life span 7, so it will disappear at turn 3 + 7 - 1? Let's see: life span N means it disappears after N turns, so if current turn is t, it will be gone by turn t + N.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span N, after one turn (turn t+1), life span becomes N-1, and so on, until life span 0, then it disappears. So with N=7 at turn 3, it will disappear after 7 turns, so on turn 10 it will be gone (since turn 3 + 7 = turn 10, but at turn 10 it disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 9? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, then:\n> \n> - After turn t, life span becomes N-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, N-2, ..., after turn t + (N-1), life span=1, and after turn t + N, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> At turn t, with life span N, it can be eaten during turns t to t+N-1 inclusive.\n> \n> For example, at turn 3, life span 7, so can be eaten on turns 3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Disappears after turn 9 or at turn 10? The problem says \"disappears after N turns\", so after N turns from now, meaning after turn t + N.\n> \n> But the countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, life span N; after turn t (so start of turn t+1), life span N-1; ... after turn t+k, life span N-k; when life span 0, it disappears before turn starts or something. I think it's better to think that at the beginning of each turn, the food has a certain life span, and after the turn, it decreases.\n> \n> But for eating, during turn, when snake moves, if head moves to food cell, it eats it.\n> \n> So, for food at (x,y) with life span L at turn T, it can be eaten if snake head moves to (x,y) on turn T, T+1, ..., up to T+L-1. On turn T+L, it disappears before the turn.\n> \n> Similarly here, turn 3, life span 7, so can be eaten on turns 3 to 9.\n> \n> Now, snake is short, only two segments. Head at (4,3), tail at (4,4). Head direction D (down), so last move was down to (4,3).\n> \n> Possible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since head direction is D, moving up (U) would be reverse, which is not allowed. Reverse of D is U, since D is (x,y-1), U is (x,y+1), opposite y-change.\n> \n> So cannot move U immediately.\n> \n> Allowed moves: D, L, R. But D is down to (4,2), L is left to (3,3), R is right to (5,3).\n> \n> Now, need to consider walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cannot go there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> For possible moves from (4,3):\n> \n> - D: (4,2) – is this wall? y=2, x=4, borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,2) is within bounds.

Obstacles: (1,3) and (2,3) are at y=3, but (3,3) not listed, so should be free? Obstacles given: (1,3), (2,3), so (3,3) is not an obstacle, so free.\n> \n> - R: (5,3) – x=5,y=3. Borders ok.

(0,0) probably bottom-left or top-left? But since y=0 and y=7 are borders, and movement U is y+1, D is y-1, so let's assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, or vice versa? Typically in such games, y=0 might be top or bottom, but from the movement, U (x,y+1) could be up or down, but since D is (x,y-1), and it's called down, probably y increases up or down?\n> \n> In standard coordinates, often y=0 is top, y increases down, but here U is (x,y+1) which is up? Let's see the description.\n> \n> \"U`(x,y+1)`, D`(x,y-1)`\" and \"down\" typically means decreasing y if y is up, but it's ambiguous.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, I'll just use coordinates as given.\n> \n> Snake head at (4,3), moving D to (4,2) if it goes down.\n> \n> Food at (5,5) which is right and up from (4,3)?

From (4,3) to (5,1): delta x=1, delta y=-2, so I can go right then down twice, but need to check path.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) is up and right, from (4,3) to (5,5): +x, +y, so right then up, or up then right.\n> \n> But (5,1) is closer in terms of y, since y=1 vs y=5 for (5,5).\n> \n> Manhattan distance: to (5,1) is |5-4| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n> \n> To (5,5) is |5-4| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n> \n> To (1,6) is |1-4| + |6-3| = 3 + 3 = 6\n> \n> So (5,1) and (5,5) are equally close, (1,6) farther.\n> \n> But (5,1) is below, (5,5) above.\n> \n> Also, obstacles: at (5,6) which is near (5,5), but (5,5) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, for (5,1), no obstacles nearby except borders.\n> \n> y=1 is above y=0, so moving to y=1 is safe, y=0 is wall.\n> \n> Now, I also need to consider that after eating, the snake grows, so paths might be blocked.\n> \n> Currently, snake is only two segments, so after eating one food, it will have three segments.\n> \n> Also, there is a rule about tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, the tail is at (4,4), and head at (4,3), so they are adjacent vertically.\n> \n> The tail has food?

After moving R, head direction becomes R.\n> \n> Then turn 5: move D to (5,1), eat food.\n> \n> But after eating, snake grows, so positions: start turn 3: head (4,3), tail (4,4)\n> \n> After move R on turn 3: head to (5,3), tail moves to (4,3)? When snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position, so tail moves to where the second segment was, but since only two segments, after moving head to (5,3), the body (which was tail) moves to head old position (4,3), so new positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), tail is the body.\n> \n> Snake becomes [(5,3), (4,3)]\n> \n> Then turn 4: move D to (5,2), so head to (5,2), body moves to (5,3), so snake [(5,2), (5,3), (4,3)]? After moving, segments shift: new head at (5,2), previous head (5,3) becomes body, and the last body (4,3) becomes tail? Let's think.\n> \n> Initial before turn 3 move: positions [head: (4,3), segment: (4,4)]\n> \n> After move R: head moves to (5,3), then the segment moves to the previous head position (4,3), so new snake: head (5,3), body (4,3), and the tail was at (4,4), but since only one body segment, it moves to (4,3), and (4,4) is abandoned? Standard snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So for a snake with segments S0 (head), S1, S2, ..., Sk (tail).\n> \n> After move, new head position based on action, then S1 moves to old S0, S2 moves to old S1, etc., so tail moves to old second last position.\n> \n> Here, only two segments: S0 = (4,3), S1 = (4,4)\n> \n> After move R: new S0 = (5,3) (since R from (4,3) is (5,3))\n> \n> Then S1 moves to old S0 position, which is (4,3)\n> \n> So new positions: head (5,3), body (4,3)\n> \n> The cell (4,4) is now empty.\n> \n> No tail anymore, just head and one body segment.\n> \n> Then turn 4: move D from (5,3) to (5,2)\n> \n> New head (5,2), body moves to old head (5,3)\n> \n> Snake: [(5,2), (5,3)]\n> \n> Then turn 5: move D to (5,1), new head (5,1), body to (5,2), and eat food at (5,1), so since positive food, length increases, so after eating, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows: head at (5,1), body at (5,2), and new segment added, but since tail didn't move, it stays, so positions: head (5,1), segment (5,2), and the previous body (5,3) remains? When eating, after moving head to food, the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> So before move turn 5: snake at [(5,2), (5,3)]\n> \n> Move head to (5,1), which has food, so eat it, then the body moves: S1 moves to old S0 (5,2), but since eating, tail doesn't move, so new segments: head (5,1), body (5,2), and the previous body (5,3) stays as part of snake, so now three segments: [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3)]\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> But in this sequence, I reached (5,1) on turn 5.\n> \n> Turn 3: move R to (5,3)\n> \n> Turn 4: move D to (5,2)\n> \n> Turn 5: move D to (5,1) and eat.\n> \n> Now, similarly, I could go to (5,5) instead.\n> \n> From (4,3), move R to (5,3) on turn 3.\n> \n> Then turn 4: move U to (5,4) (since U is (x,y+1), so y+1)\n> \n> From (5,3) to (5,4) is U.\n> \n> Then turn 5: move U to (5,5) and eat.\n> \n> But on turn 4, from (5,3), head direction is R (after moving R on turn 3), so moving U is not reverse?

Grid is 8x8? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so 8 rows and 8 columns, but borders are walls, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's confirm.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6 are playable, except for internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). (3,6) – y=6 is the top border? y=7 is wall, y=6 might be playable? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 should be playable, similarly x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so row y=0 and y=7 are all walls. Similarly, x=0 and x=7 are walls. So the playable grid is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> But internal obstacles are given, so:\n> \n> - (3,6): x=3, y=6 – since y=6 is not wall, but this cell is obstacle.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1): x=2,y=1 – playable but obstacle.\n> \n> (1,3): x=1,y=3 – playable but obstacle.\n> \n> (2,3): x=2,y=3 – playable but obstacle.\n> \n> (5,6): x=5,y=6 – playable but obstacle.\n> \n> Also, borders are walls, so (x,0), (x,7) for all x, and (0,y), (7,y) for all y are walls.\n> \n> Now snake: head at (5,3), body at (4,3), direction right.

Head is (5,3), (6,4) is one right and one up? Let's see coordinates.\n> \n> Assume (x,y): x horizontal, y vertical.\n> \n> Head: (5,3)\n> \n> Food: (5,5) – that's (x=5,y=5), so same x, y+2 (up 2)\n> \n> (1,6) – x=1,y=6\n> \n> (5,1) – x=5,y=1, so same x, y-2 (down 2)\n> \n> (6,4) – x=6,y=4, so x+1, y+1 (right and up)\n> \n> Since head is at (5,3), moving right.\n> \n> First, I need to choose an action for turn t=4.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, R (since L not allowed).\n> \n> Let's see what each move does:\n> \n> - Move U (up): to (5,4)\n> \n> - Move D (down): to (5,2)\n> \n> - Move R (right): to (6,3)\n> \n> Now, (6,3) – is this safe? Walls: x=7 is wall, but x=6 is playable? x from 1 to 6, since x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=6 is not wall. But is there obstacle? Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). None at (6,3), so (6,3) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) should be free, no obstacle there.\n> \n> (5,2) should be free.\n> \n> Now, food at (6,4) is very close. (6,4) is adjacent? From (5,3) to (6,4) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are (5,4) up, (5,2) down, (6,3) right, (4,3) left but left not possible.\n> \n> (6,4) is diagonally adjacent, but in Snake, we move orthogonally, not diagonally. So from (5,3), I can go to (5,4), (5,2), (6,3), or (4,3) but not allowed since reverse.\n> \n> (6,4) is not directly reachable in one move; I need to go to (6,3) or (5,4) first.\n> \n> (6,4) is at (6,4), which is one right and one up from (5,3). So to reach it, I could go right to (6,3) then up to (6,4), or up to (5,4) then right to (6,4).\n> \n> But (6,4) has food with life_span=10, which is long, so it might be a good target.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods: (5,5) at (5,5), life_span=6. From (5,3), I can go up to (5,4), then to (5,5) if I want.\n> \n> (5,1) at (5,1), life_span=6, down from current position.\n> \n> (1,6) at (1,6), far away, life_span=6.\n> \n> Now, life_span: all food has life_span given, and it decreases each turn, including current. Current turn t=4, so for example, (5,5) life_span=6, means it will disappear after 6 turns, so at turn t=10 it disappears? Life_span decreases every turn, so at turn t, life_span left is given; after this turn, it decreases by 1.\n> \n> The state says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (5,5) with life_span=6 on turn t=4, that means after turn t=4, life_span becomes 5, then after t=5, 4, and so on, until life_span=0, it disappears. So it disappears at the end of turn when life_span reaches 0.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> (6,4) has life_span=10, so longer lasting.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, snake is short, only 2 segments, so not much body to worry about yet. But if I eat, it grows.\n> \n> Special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills. But here, tail is at (4,3), head at (5,3), so they are adjacent horizontally. Tail is at (4,3), head at (5,3), so adjacent.\n> \n> But food is not on tail yet; tail is at (4,3), no food there. Food positions are given separately.\n> \n> Currently, no food under snake, I think. Snake positions: (5,3) and (4,3), food at (5,5), (1,6), (5,1), (6,4), none on snake cells, so no issue.\n> \n> But if I move, and later food might be under body, but for now, no.\n> \n> Now, let's consider possible paths.\n> \n> First, the food at (6,4) is very close and has long life, but it's not directly reachable. I need to move to (6,3) or (5,4) first.\n> \n> If I move right to (6,3) on turn t=4, then from there, I can go to (6,4) on turn t=5 to eat the food.\n> \n> Is (6,3) safe? Let's check.\n> \n> After moving to (6,3), snake positions: head to (6,3), body: since snake was [(5,3), (4,3)], after move, head moves to new position, tail moves away, so new positions: head (6,3), body (5,3). Tail was at (4,3), which moves away, so cell (4,3) is empty now.\n> \n> Then on turn t=5, from (6,3), I can move up to (6,4) to eat the food.\n> \n> (6,4) has food, so eating it: value +1, length increases by 1. So after eating, snake becomes head at (6,4), body (6,3), (5,3)? When you eat, you grow, so after moving to food, you don't remove the tail that turn.\n> \n> Movement: when you move to a cell with food, you eat it, and the tail doesn't move that turn, so length increases by one.\n> \n> So if on turn t=5, head moves to (6,4) which has food, then snake becomes: head (6,4), and body: previous head (6,3) and previous body (5,3), so positions [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3)].\n> \n> Then direction would be up.\n> \n> Now, is there any danger? At (6,4), what about walls? x=6, y=4, not wall, not obstacle. But borders: x=7 is wall, so (6,4) is adjacent to x=7? (7,4) is wall, but (6,4) is not wall. Similarly, y=4, not border.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6) is obstacle, but (6,4) is fine.\n> \n> So eating (6,4) seems possible and safe for turn t=5.\n> \n> But I need to get to (6,3) first on turn t=4.\n> \n> On turn t=4, if I move right to (6,3), is that safe?\n> \n> (6,3): x=6, y=3, not border, not obstacle (obstacles are at (3,6), (2,1), etc., not (6,3)).\n> \n> Also, snake body: after move, positions are (6,3) and (5,3), so no self-collision.\n> \n> Then on t=5, move up to (6,4) to eat.\n> \n> After eating, snake is longer, at [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3)].\n> \n> Now, from there, I need to plan further.\n> \n> But let's see other options.\n> \n> I could go for other food, but (6,4) is close and easy.\n> \n> What about (5,5)? To get to (5,5), I could go up.\n> \n> On t=4, move up to (5,4).\n> \n> Then from (5,4), on t=5, I could move up to (5,5) to eat.\n> \n> (5,5) has food, life_span=6, which is enough since after t=4, life_span=5, then t=5, it will be 4 when I eat? On turn t=5, when I move to it, life_span decreases each turn, but if I move to it on t=5, it should be there.\n> \n> Current t=4, food at (5,5) has life_span=6. After t=4, it becomes 5. Then on t=5, before move, life_span is 5, I move to it, so I eat it, and after that, life_span decreases to 4, but since I ate it, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> So for (5,5), I can eat on t=5 if I go via (5,4).\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) is down, but life_span same.\n> \n> But (6,4) has longer life_span=10, so it will last longer, but since I can eat it soon, it might not matter.\n> \n> (6,4) is closer in terms of steps?

Walls include borders and internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6).\n> \n> The snake is at positions: head at (6,3) and tail at (5,3), so it's only two segments long right now.

Since it's turn 5, and life span decreases each turn including current, so for food at (5,5), life span 5, it will disappear after turn 5 + 5 - 1? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So for food with life span L, it appears at turn T, it will disappear after T + L - 1 turns? I need to be careful.\n> \n> It says: \"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if at turn t, a food has life span L, then:\n> \n> - At turn t, life span = L\n> \n> - Turn t+1, life span = L-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t + L - 1, life span = 1\n> \n> - After turn t + L - 1, it disappears, so on turn t + L, it's gone.\n> \n> The food is present from turn t to turn t + L - 1 inclusive.\n> \n> In the state, it's given with life span at current turn. Current turn is 5.\n> \n> So for (5,5): life span 5 at turn 5, so it will be present on turns 5,6,7,8,9. Disappears after turn 9.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6): life span 5 at turn 5, present turns 5-9.\n> \n> (5,1): life span 5, present turns 5-9.\n> \n> (6,4): life span 9 at turn 5, present turns 5-13.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,3), moving right.

Since the tail will move when I move, I might be able to move there, but let's see the rules.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" So moving to tail position is allowed because tail moves away.\n> \n> But in this case, snake positions: head (6,3), tail (5,3). If I move left to (5,3), which is current tail, after move, head moves to (5,3), tail moves to... since snake grows only when eating, and I'm not eating, so tail should move to the previous position? Standard snake: when you move without eating, head moves to new position, and tail is removed from the end.\n> \n> Positions: before move: [(6,3), (5,3)]\n> \n> After moving left to (5,3): head moves to (5,3), but (5,3) was tail, but now it's occupied by head. Then tail should be removed, so new positions: [(5,3)] but that can't be, since head and tail same position? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when you move without eating, head moves to adjacent cell, and tail segment is removed, so the snake moves forward.\n> \n> So from [(6,3), (5,3)] moving left to (5,3): but (5,3) is the current tail position. After move, head is at (5,3), and since no growth, tail is removed, so the body segment at (5,3) is gone, but head is now at (5,3), so the snake should be just [(5,3)], meaning it's a single segment? But that doesn't make sense for a snake of length 2.\n> \n> Perhaps the positions are updated as: new head at (5,3), and since the tail was at (5,3), which is now the head, there is no tail left? That would kill the snake? But the rule says you can move into tail position.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, before move, tail is at (5,3). If head moves to (5,3), then after move, the tail moves forward to... but in a snake of length 2, moving to the tail position should result in the head and tail swapping or something? I think I need to simulate.\n> \n> Initial: head at (6,3), tail at (5,3). Head moves left to (5,3). Now, the new head is at (5,3). Since no food eaten, tail is removed. The tail was at (5,3), but now head is there, so when tail is removed, the cell is empty, and snake is now just [(5,3)] with length 1? But that seems odd, and probably not a collision since it's the tail.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment)\" but when moving to tail, it's okay because tail moves away.\n> \n> After the move: head is at (5,3), which was the previous tail position, but since tail moves, it should be fine. The body segments: after move, the snake has only one segment? For a snake of length 2, moving to the tail cell should result in the snake moving to that cell with no change in length, but it's now length 1? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think I have a misunderstanding. Let me think of a larger snake.\n> \n> Suppose snake positions: head at A, then B, then C (tail). If head moves to B, which is the neck, then after move, head is at B, and since no growth, tail C is removed, so new positions: [B, C] but B was the neck, now head at B, and body at C? Positions: before move: [A, B, C] with A head, C tail. Move head to B. New head at B. Then, without growth, the tail is removed, so C is removed, leaving [B]. So snake is now just [B], length 1.\n> \n> But in terms of collision, when head moves to B, B was a body segment, so it should be a collision? But the rule says you can move to tail position only if it's the tail, and it's okay because tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, for length 2, [head, tail], moving to tail: head moves to tail position, tail is removed, but since tail was there, it's like the snake shortens to length 1 at that position. But is that allowed? And no collision because the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> The rule: \"head touches any body segment\" – when moving, if the new head position is a body segment, it's collision, except if it's the tail and the tail will move.\n> \n> Specifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So for length 2 snake: positions [H, T]. Move head to T's position. New head position is T. Then, since no food, tail is removed, so T is removed, and new snake is [T] but T is now the head, so positions [new head at old T position], length 1.\n> \n> No collision because the only body segment was T, and it was the tail, so it's allowed.\n> \n> In this case, for our snake, moving left to (5,3) is possible and safe.\n> \n> Similarly, other moves.\n> \n> Now, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6).\n> \n> So let's list all possible moves from (6,3):\n> \n> - U: (6,4) – y=4, is this wall? y=4 is not border, and (6,4) is not in internal obstacles. Internal obstacles are (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). (6,4) not there, so possible.\n> \n> - D: (6,2) – not border, not obstacle, possible.\n> \n> - L: (5,3) – not border, not obstacle ( (5,3) is tail, but allowed as per above), so possible.\n> \n> - R: (7,3) – x=7 is border, so wall, cannot move.\n> \n> So possible actions: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, also, there is food at (6,4), which is directly above, with value 1 and life span 9.\n> \n> If I move up to (6,4), I eat the food, since head moves there.\n> \n> Then snake grows: new head at (6,4), and tail remains, so positions become [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3)]? After eating, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> Standard: when you eat, head moves to food, food is consumed, and a new segment is added at the tail, so tail stays in place for that turn, then moves next turn.\n> \n> Positions: before move: [(6,3), (5,3)]\n> \n> Move U to (6,4): (6,4) has food, so eat it. New head at (6,4), and since ate, tail not removed, so positions: [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3)] – now three segments.\n> \n> Then next turn, if no eat, tail moves.\n> \n> But here, (6,4) has food, so I eat it.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score and survive.\n> \n> Also, the \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, for move to (6,4), the tail is at (5,3), not adjacent to head or to (6,4). Head at (6,3), tail at (5,3), not adjacent; adjacent cells are (5,3), (7,3), (6,4), (6,2). Tail is at (5,3), which is adjacent to head, but (5,3) is not a food cell; food is at (6,4), which is different.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger\" only applies if the tail cell itself has food and head is adjacent to tail.\n> \n> Here, tail cell (5,3) has no food, so no issue.\n> \n> So moving U to (6,4) is possible and I eat food, growing to length 3.\n> \n> Now, other options: move D to (6,2) or L to (5,3).\n> \n> Move L to (5,3): as above, since it's tail, I move there, no eat, so snake becomes [(5,3)] with length 1? Positions: after move, head at (5,3), tail removed, so only one segment at (5,3). Then next turn, I can move from there.\n> \n> But that seems risky because I shorten the snake, and I might need to grow again.\n> \n> Move D to (6,2): no food there, so head to (6,2), tail removed, snake becomes [(6,2), (6,3)]? Before move: [(6,3), (5,3)]\n> \n> Move D to (6,2): new head (6,2), no food, so tail (5,3) removed, new positions [(6,2), (6,3)]? No: when moving, head moves to new position, and tail is removed only if no growth.\n> \n> Standard: positions list: let's say index 0 is head, then body segments.\n> \n> Before move: positions[0] = (6,3) head, positions[1] = (5,3) tail.\n> \n> Move to new cell.\n> \n> If new cell has no food, then new head = new position, and remove tail, so new positions: [new head] + positions[0:-1] but positions[0] is old head, positions[1] is tail.\n> \n> After move without eating: new head position = new cell, and the body is the old head position, tail removed.\n> \n> So from [(6,3), (5,3)] move to (6,2) no food: new head (6,2), and body is (6,3), so new positions [(6,2), (6,3)] with (6,2) head, (6,3) tail.\n> \n> Similarly, move to (5,3) no food: new head (5,3), and since (5,3) was tail, the body is (6,3)? Old positions: head (6,3), tail (5,3). Move to (5,3): new head at (5,3), and the old head (6,3) becomes the new body, but since no tail removed, it should be new positions [(5,3), (6,3)] with head (5,3), tail (6,3).\n> \n> But (5,3) was tail, now it's head, and (6,3) was head, now it's tail.\n> \n> Snake length remains 2.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move U to (6,4) with food, new head (6,4), and no tail removed, so positions [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3)] with head (6,4), body (6,3), tail (5,3).\n> \n> Back to decision.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, immediate options:\n> \n> - Move U: to (6,4), eat food, grow to length 3.
