        "thinking": "### Understanding the Game State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand where everything is positioned and what options are available.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   \n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: These are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal obstacle at (3, 1). This means the snake cannot move to (3, 1).\n\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's head is at (3, 4), and its body segment is at (3, 3). So, the snake is two segments long.\n   - **Direction**: The snake's head is currently moving \"Up\" (U), which means in the positive y-direction.\n\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are three pieces of food:\n     1. At (5, 2) with value 1 and life span 9.\n     2. At (2, 5) with value 1 and life span 9.\n     3. At (3, 6) with value 1 and life span 10.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Up, the snake cannot move Down (D) in the next move, as that would be the opposite direction.\n   \n   So, possible directions to consider: U, L, R.\n\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Collisions**:\n   - **Up (U)**: Current head is at (3, 4). Moving up would take it to (3, 5).\n     - Check walls: y=5 is not a border (since y=7 is the border), and (3,5) is not an internal obstacle.\n     - Check body: The body is at (3,3), so no collision.\n     - Valid move.\n   - **Left (L)**: Current head is at (3, 4). Moving left would take it to (2, 4).\n     - Check walls: x=2 is not a border, and there's no internal obstacle at (2,4).\n     - Check body: Body is at (3,3), no collision.\n     - Valid move.\n   - **Right (R)**: Current head is at (3, 4). Moving right would take it to (4, 4).\n     - Check walls: x=4 is not a border, and no internal obstacle at (4,4).\n     - Check body: Body is at (3,3), no collision.\n     - Valid move.\n\nSo, possible moves: U, L, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Possible Move\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move based on the food positions and potential risks.\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (3,5)**:\n   - **Food**: Is there food at (3,5)? No.\n   - **Future Options**: From (3,5), possible moves would be U (to (3,6)), L (to (2,5)), R (to (4,5)).\n     - (3,6) has food with value 1.\n     - (2,5) has food with value 1.\n     - (4,5) has no food.\n   - **Risk**: Moving to (3,5) doesn't immediately eat food, but positions the snake to potentially eat food at (3,6) or (2,5) next.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (2,4)**:\n   - **Food**: Is there food at (2,4)? No.\n   - **Future Options**: From (2,4), possible moves would be U (to (2,5)), D (to (2,3)), L (to (1,4)), R (to (3,4)).\n     - (2,5) has food with value 1.\n     - (3,4) is the current head position (body would have moved), but no food there.\n   - **Risk**: Moving left doesn't eat food now but can lead to (2,5) next.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (4,4)**:\n   - **Food**: Is there food at (4,4)? No.\n   - **Future Options**: From (4,4), possible moves would be U (to (4,5)), D (to (4,3)), L (to (3,4)), R (to (5,4)).\n     - (5,4) has no food.\n     - (3,4) is the previous head position (body would be at (3,4) now, but head was at (3,4), so body is at (3,3), and new body would be at (3,4) if we moved to (4,4)).\n   - **Risk**: Moving right doesn't eat food now and doesn't immediately lead to food next turn unless we go to (5,4), then (5,3), then (5,2) which has food, but that's two moves away.\n\n### Considering Food Positions\n\nLet's look at the food positions relative to the head:\n\n1. (5,2): Distance is |5-3| + |2-4| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n2. (2,5): Distance is |2-3| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n3. (3,6): Distance is |3-3| + |6-4| = 0 + 2 = 2.\n\nThe closest foods are at (2,5) and (3,6), both at Manhattan distance 2.\n\n- To reach (2,5):\n  - Path 1: Left to (2,4), then Up to (2,5).\n  - Path 2: Up to (3,5), then Left to (2,5).\n  \n- To reach (3,6):\n  - Path: Up to (3,5), then Up to (3,6).\n\nBoth require two moves, but moving Left first seems more direct for (2,5), and moving Up first is direct for (3,6).\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule states that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrently:\n- Tail is at (3,3).\n- Head is at (3,4).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (2,3), (4,3), (3,2), (3,4).\n   - Head is at (3,4), which is adjacent to tail.\n   - But there's no food at (3,3), so no danger here.\n\n### Decision Making\n\nGiven that both (2,5) and (3,6) are equally close, let's see which path is safer or more beneficial.\n\n1. **Option 1: Move Left to (2,4)**:\n   - Next move can be Up to (2,5) to eat food.\n   - After eating, snake grows to length 3: head at (2,5), body at (2,4), tail at (3,4).\n   - Then, possible moves from (2,5): U (to (2,6)), D (to (2,4) - but body is there), L (to (1,5)), R (to (3,5)).\n     - (2,6): y=6 is safe, no body there yet.\n     - (1,5): x=1 is safe, no body there.\n     - (3,5): no body there yet.\n   - Seems safe.\n\n2. **Option 2: Move Up to (3,5)**:\n   - Next move can be Up to (3,6) to eat food.\n   - After eating, snake grows to length 3: head at (3,6), body at (3,5), tail at (3,4).\n   - Then, possible moves from (3,6): U (to (3,7) - but y=7 is wall), D (to (3,5) - body), L (to (2,6)), R (to (4,6)).\n     - (2,6) and (4,6) are safe.\n   - Also seems safe.\n\nBoth options seem safe. Now, let's see if one is better than the other:\n\n- Moving Left first leads to (2,5), which is closer to (5,2) in the future.\n- Moving Up first leads to (3,6), which is away from other foods.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving Up first is better because (3,6) is directly above, and then we can consider moving left or right from there to reach other foods.\n\nGiven that both are safe and equally beneficial in the immediate next step, I might choose the one that keeps more options open. Moving Up first seems to keep the snake more centered, allowing future flexibility.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs there any food that can be eaten immediately? No, because the head is at (3,4), and food is at (5,2), (2,5), (3,6). None\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",

The tail is at (3,4), and there's no food mentioned there.\n    - **Correction**: The condition is about the tail cell having food. Since the tail is at (3,4) and no food is listed there, it's safe.\n- Check for collisions:\n  - No body segments at (2,5).\n  - Not a wall.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe to move L and eat the food.\n\n#### Option 3: Move Right (R)\n- New head position: (4,5)\n- Check for food at (4,5): No food listed here.\n- Check for collisions:\n  - No body segments at (4,5).\n  - Not a wall.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe but no immediate reward.\n\n### Evaluating Options\n\n1. **Move U**: Immediate reward, no danger.\n2. **Move L**: Immediate reward, no danger.\n3. **Move R**: No reward, but safe.\n\nBetween U and L, both provide rewards. The choice depends on future planning, but since we need an immediate action, both are viable.\n\n### Potential Future Considerations\n\n- **Food Life Span**: All foods have life spans of 8 or 9, but since the current turn is 2, they'll last for several more turns.\n- **Obstacle**: There's an obstacle at (3,1), but it's far from the current position.\n- **Snake Growth**: Eating food increases the length, which might complicate future movements.\n\n### Decision\n\nSince both U and L are safe and provide rewards, but U is in the current direction, it might be more straightforward to continue in the same direction. Changing direction to L might be necessary if future food positions require it, but for now, U is a safe and rewarding option.\n\n### Verification\n\n- **Move U**: \n  - New head at (3,6), body becomes [(3,6), (3,5)].\n  - Length increases to 3.\n  - Food at (3,6) is eaten and disappears.\n\n- **Move L**: \n  - New head at (2,5), body becomes [(2,5), (3,5)].\n  - Length increases to 3.\n  - Food at (2,5) is eaten and disappears.\n\nBoth options are valid, but U is more aligned with the current direction.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best immediate action is to continue moving Up.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Since the current direction is U, the next move cannot be D.\n   - Must avoid walls and body collisions.\n\n2. **Food Mechanics**:\n   - Both foods are positive (+1).\n   - Food can be under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto the food cell.\n   - **Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nGiven the current head position (3,6) and direction U, the possible moves are U, L, R (since D is the reverse of U and is not allowed).\n\n#### Option 1: Continue Up (U)\n- New head position: (3,7).\n- Check for walls: y=7 is a border wall → collision → death.\n- **Conclusion**: Not viable.\n\n#### Option 2: Left (L)\n- New head position: (2,6).\n- Check for walls: x=2 is within bounds (0-7), y=6 is within bounds.\n- Check for body collision: The body is at (3,5) and (3,4). (2,6) is not part of the body → safe.\n- Check for food: (2,5) is food, but the head moves to (2,6) → no immediate food consumption.\n- **Conclusion**: Viable.\n\n#### Option 3: Right (R)\n- New head position: (4,6).\n- Check for walls: x=4 is within bounds, y=6 is within bounds.\n- Check for body collision: (4,6) is not part of the body → safe.\n- Check for food: No food at (4,6).\n- **Conclusion**: Viable.\n\n### Evaluating Food Accessibility\n\n- **Food at (5,2)**: Far from the current position. Not immediately relevant.\n- **Food at (2,5)**:\n  - Current head is at (3,6).\n  - Moving L takes the head to (2,6).\n  - From (2,6), the next move could be D to reach (2,5).\n  - However, the tail is at (3,4). After moving L, the tail moves to (3,5) because the snake moves forward.\n  - The food is at (2,5). If the head moves to (2,5) in the next turn, the tail would be at (3,4) (since the snake grows when eating food).\n  - But, the condition says: if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n  - In this case, the head at (2,6) is adjacent to the tail at (3,5). The food is at (2,5), not on the tail. So, no immediate danger.\n  - However, if the head moves to (2,5) next, the tail will be at (3,4), and the head is not adjacent to the tail anymore.\n  - **But**, the condition is about the tail having food. Here, the food is not on the tail, but on a separate cell.\n\n**Clarification Needed**: The condition is a bit ambiguous. It says \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food\". In this case, the tail is at (3,5), and the food is at (2,5). The tail cell does not have food. So, it's safe.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\n- **Option L**: Leads to (2,6). From there, the next move could be D to (2,5) to eat the food.\n  - After moving L, the snake's new positions would be [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)].\n  - Then, moving D to (2,5) would be valid since the tail is now at (3,5).\n  - The head moves to (2,5), eats the food, and the snake grows to [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)].\n\n- **Option R**: Leads to (4,6). No immediate food, but more open space.\n  - Future moves could be U, L, R (since D would be a reverse of U, but the previous move was R, so D is allowed if the head direction changes).\n\n### Risk Assessment\n\n- **Option L**: Immediate safety, potential to reach food in the next move.\n- **Option R**: Also safe, but no immediate path to food.\n\n### Decision\n\nSince both L and R are safe, but L provides a clear path to the food at (2,5) in the next move, it's more advantageous.\n\n### Verification\n\n- **No instant reverse**: Current direction is U. Moving L is not a reverse → valid.\n- **No collision**: (2,6) is not a wall or body part.\n- **Food**: Not eaten immediately, but sets up for the next move.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter considering all options, the best immediate action is to move Left (L).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Current Turn**: 4\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n   - Internal obstacle: (3, 1)\n3. **Snake Positions**:\n   - Head: (2, 6)\n   - Body: (3, 6), (3, 5)\n   - So the snake is three segments long: head at (2,6), then (3,6), then (3,5)\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Left (L)\n5. **Food Items**:\n   - (5, 2): value=6, life_span=1\n   - (2, 5): value=6, life_span=1\n   - (5, 4): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, it cannot reverse its direction instantly. Since the current direction is Left (L), the opposite direction is Right (R), which is not allowed next. So possible moves are U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) - (x-1, y)\nCurrent head: (2, 6)\nNew head position: (1, 6)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: x=0 is a wall, (1,6) is not a wall.\n- Body: Snake body is at (3,6) and (3,5). (1,6) is not part of the body.\n  \nIs there food at (1,6)? No, the foods are at (5,2), (2,5), (5,4).\n\nSo moving Left is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) - (x, y+1)\nCurrent head: (2, 6)\nNew head position: (2, 7)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: y=7 is a border wall. So (2,7) is a wall - collision!\n  \nCannot move Up.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) - (x, y-1)\nCurrent head: (2, 6)\nNew head position: (2, 5)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: y=0 is at bottom, (2,5) is not a wall.\n- Body: Snake body is at (3,6) and (3,5). (2,5) is not part of the body.\n  \nIs there food at (2,5)? Yes! One of the food items is at (2,5) with value=6, life_span=1.\n\nNow, check if eating this food is safe:\n- After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the new tail will be where the current tail is (3,5), and the body extends.\n- The current tail is at (3,5). The new head will be at (2,5), and the new tail will be at (3,5) (since the tail moves forward, but because we're growing, the tail stays where it is, and a new segment is added where the head was).\n  \nWait, let's clarify tail movement:\nOriginal snake: [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\nAfter moving Down to (2,5) and eating:\nNew snake: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\nNow, is the head adjacent to the tail? Head is at (2,5), tail is at (3,5). They are adjacent (right next to each other horizontally).\nIs there positive food at the tail? The tail is at (3,5), and the foods are at (5,2), (2,5), (5,4). So no food at (3,5). \n\nWait, the rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake. Here, the tail is at (3,5), and there's no food there, so no danger.\n\nBut actually, the food we're eating is at (2,5), not at the tail. So no issue.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,5) is positive (value=6 is positive, since the example shows value and then life_span, and earlier it says positive food has reward=+1, but here value is 6, which seems to be the reward).\n\nSo eating (2,5) gives +6 to score and increases length by 1.\n\nIs there any other danger? No collision, no wall, no body collision, and no tail reward danger.\n\n#### 4. Move Right (R) - (x+1, y)\nCurrent head: (2, 6)\nNew head position: (3, 6)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: (3,6) is not a wall.\n- Body: The body is at (3,6) and (3,5). (3,6) is the first body segment - collision!\n  \nCannot move Right.\n\n### Comparing Possible Moves\n\nPossible safe moves: Left (L) and Down (D).\n\n- Left: Safe, no food eaten.\n- Down: Safe, eats positive food at (2,5) with reward +6.\n\nClearly, moving Down is better as it increases the score.\n\n### Verifying Food Life Span\n\nFood at (2,5) has life_span=1. Current turn is 4. Does it disappear after this turn? The rule says \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nAssuming life_span is the number of turns the food remains, starting from when it spawned. If it's 1, it might disappear after this turn, so we should eat it now.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down to eat the positive food at (2,5).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

So, the snake cannot move outside these borders.\n   - There's one internal obstacle at (3, 1).\n\n2. **Snake Details**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is at [(2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5)].\n     - Head is at (2, 5).\n     - Next segment is at (2, 6).\n     - Then (3, 6).\n     - Tail is at (3, 5).\n   - **Current Direction**: The head is moving Down (\"D\"), meaning it was moving in the negative y-direction last turn.\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - **First Food**: (5, 2) with value = +1, life_span = 5.\n   - **Second Food**: (5, 4) with value = +1, life_span = 9.\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\nFrom the current head position (2, 5) and direction \"D\", the possible moves are:\n\n- **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) = (2, 6) — but this is the snake's own body segment (second segment). Moving here would cause a collision (head touches body), which is deadly. So, **invalid**.\n  \n- **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) = (2, 4) — need to check if this is a wall or obstacle.\n  - Walls: y=0 is a wall, but y=4 is not a border wall.\n  - Obstacles: (3, 1) is not at (2, 4).\n  - Body: Check if (2, 4) is part of the snake's body. Current body positions are (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5). So, (2,4) is safe.\n  - **Valid move**.\n\n- **Left (L)**: (x-1, y) = (1, 5) — check:\n  - Walls: x=0 is a wall, but x=1 is not.\n  - Obstacles: (3,1) is not at (1,5).\n  - Body: (1,5) is not in the snake's body.\n  - **Valid move**.\n\n- **Right (R)**: (x+1, y) = (3, 5) — check:\n  - Walls: x=7 is a wall, but x=3 is not.\n  - Obstacles: (3,1) is not at (3,5).\n  - Body: The tail is at (3,5). Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move forward, but we need to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n    - If the tail has positive food and the head is adjacent to the tail, eating it would kill the snake because the head and newly grown tail would collide.\n    - Currently, the tail is at (3,5). Is there food at (3,5)? Looking at the food positions: (5,2) and (5,4). No food at (3,5), so no danger.\n  - **Valid move**.\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves: D, L, R\n\nNow, let's evaluate the valid moves based on proximity to food and safety.\n\n1. **Move Down (D) to (2,4)**:\n   - Distance to food:\n     - (5,2): Manhattan distance = |5-2| + |2-4| = 3 + 2 = 5.\n     - (5,4): |5-2| + |4-4| = 3 + 0 = 3.\n   - Closest food is (5,4) with distance 3.\n   - Path: To reach (5,4), could go RRR then D (but need to check obstacles).\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (1,5)**:\n   - Distance to food:\n     - (5,2): |5-1| + |2-5| = 4 + 3 = 7.\n     - (5,4): |5-1| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5.\n   - Further from both foods compared to moving D or R.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (3,5)**:\n   - Distance to food:\n     - (5,2): |5-3| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n     - (5,4): |5-3| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n   - Same closest food (5,4) as moving D, but moving R seems more direct towards (5,4):\n     - From (3,5), next move could be R to (4,5), then R to (5,5), then D to (5,4).\n     - Or from (3,5), D to (3,4), then R to (4,4), then R to (5,4).\n\nComparing D and R:\n- Moving D to (2,4) is safe but doesn't directly advance towards food as effectively as moving R.\n- Moving R to (3,5) is safe (no food under tail) and is a step towards the closest food at (5,4).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs any food adjacent to the current head (2,5)?\n\n- (5,2): Not adjacent (distance is 5).\n- (5,4): Distance is 3, not adjacent.\n\nNo immediate food to eat this turn, so the goal is to move towards the closest food safely.\n\n### Avoiding Future Collisions\n\nAfter moving R to (3,5), the snake's body will be:\n- New head: (3,5).\n- Then (2,5), (2,6), (3,6).\n- Tail was at (3,5), which is now the head, so the tail moves from (3,5) to (2,5), but wait, no: the tail is at (3,5), which is now the head, so the tail was at (3,5), which is now the head, so the new tail is the second-to-last segment, which is (3,6). Wait, let's clarify:\n\nOriginal body: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] (head to tail).\nAfter moving R to (3,5):\n- New head: (3,5).\n- Then previous head: (2,5).\n- Then (2,6).\n- Then (3,6) is the new tail (since the tail was at (3,5), which is now the head, so the segment before that is the new tail).\n\nSo new body: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)].\n\nNext possible moves from (3,5):\n- Current direction is R (since we moved R from D, but the rule is no instant reverse, so cannot move L (opposite of R)).\n- Possible next moves: U, D, R.\n\nThis seems safe for future moves.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween D and R, moving R seems more advantageous as it's a step towards the closest food at (5,4) without immediate risks.\n\nMoving D is also safe but doesn't advance towards food as directly.\n\nMoving L takes us away from food.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move **Right (R)**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn (t₀):** 6\n\n**Walls:**\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)), and the snake cannot go outside these borders.\n- Internal obstacle: (3,1). The snake cannot move into this cell.\n\n**Snake Positions:**\n- Head: (3,5)\n- Body segments in order: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n  \nSo, the snake's body forms a sort of \"L\" shape:\n- Head at (3,5), facing right (direction R).\n- Next segment is (2,5) (left of head).\n- Then (2,6) (down from (2,5)).\n- Then (3,6) (right from (2,6)).\n\n**Snake Head Direction:** R (right). This means the last move was to the right, so the snake cannot move left in the next move (no instant reverse).\n\n**Food:**\n1. (5,2), value = +1, life_span = 4\n2. (5,4), value = +1, life_span = 8\n\nBoth foods are positive (+1), so eating either is good, but we need to consider their positions and how to reach them safely.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (3,5), facing right (R), the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U):** (x,y+1) → (3,6)\n- **Down (D):** (x,y-1) → (3,4)\n- **Right (R):** (x+1,y) → (4,5)\n- **Left (L):** (x-1,y) → (2,5)\n\nBut:\n- Cannot move left (L) because that's the opposite of the current direction (R), which is not allowed (no instant reverse).\n  \nSo, possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (3,6)\n- Current body segments: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n- Moving to (3,6): This is the current tail position. Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move away, but we need to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n  - Is there positive food at the tail? Currently, the tail is at (3,6), and the foods are at (5,2) and (5,4), so no food at (3,6). Hence, no danger.\n- After move:\n  - New head: (3,6)\n  - New body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n  - Tail (2,6) moves away, so no collision.\n  \nBut is this move beneficial? It doesn't get us closer to any food. It's just moving into the tail's current position, which is safe but doesn't help in scoring.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (D) to (3,4)\n- Check if (3,4) is valid:\n  - Not a wall: borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7; internal obstacle is (3,1), so (3,4) is clear.\n  - Not part of the body: body is at (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), so no collision.\n  \n- Distance to foods:\n  - Food at (5,2): Manhattan distance from (3,4) is |5-3| + |2-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n  - Food at (5,4): |5-3| + |4-4| = 2 + 0 = 2\n  - Moving down gets us closer to (5,4).\n\n- After move:\n  - New head: (3,4)\n  - New body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n  - Tail moves away from (3,6), so length increases if we eat food, but currently not eating.\n\nThis seems like a good move towards the food at (5,4).\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (4,5)\n- Check if (4,5) is valid:\n  - Not a wall: x=7 is border, so x=4 is fine; y=5 is not a border.\n  - Not part of the body: body is at (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), so no collision.\n  \n- Distance to foods:\n  - Food at (5,2): |5-4| + |2-5| = 1 + 3 = 4\n  - Food at (5,4): |5-4| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2\n  - Moving right also gets us closer to (5,4), same as moving down in terms of distance to (5,4).\n\n- After move:\n  - New head: (4,5)\n  - New body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n  - Tail moves away from (3,6).\n\nThis is also a good move towards the food at (5,4).\n\n### Comparing Down (D) and Right (R)\n\nBoth D and R get us equally closer to (5,4) in terms of Manhattan distance (distance decreases by 1 in both cases). \n\nBut let's see the paths:\n- From (3,5):\n  - D to (3,4): then to reach (5,4), next moves could be R, R (to (5,4)).\n  - R to (4,5): then to reach (5,4), next move could be D (to (4,4)), then R (to (5,4)).\n\nBoth require two more moves to reach the food. \n\nBut also consider the other food at (5,2):\n- From (3,4): distance to (5,2) is 4.\n- From (4,5): distance to (5,2) is 4.\nNo difference.\n\nAnother consideration is the life span of the foods:\n- (5,2): life_span = 4, current turn = 6, so disappears at turn 10.\n- (5,4): life_span = 8, disappears at turn 14.\nBoth are safe for now.\n\nAlso, no immediate danger in either move.\n\n### Deciding Between D and R\n\nBoth seem equally good. Maybe consider the snake's body position after the move to see which leaves more options open.\n\nAfter D to (3,4):\n- Next moves could be R or D (but D would go to (3,3), not helpful), or U (back to (3,5), which is the previous head, but that's part of the body now, so invalid).\nSo likely next move would be R to (4,4).\n\nAfter R to (4,5):\n- Next moves could be R to (5,5), D to (4,4), or U to (4,6).\n- U to (4,6) is safe (not part of body), but not towards food.\n- D to (4,4) is towards (5,4).\n- R to (5,5) is away from both foods.\n\nSo R now allows D next to go towards (5,4), similar to D now allowing R next.\n\nNo clear advantage. Maybe choose R to keep options open, as moving right now might allow more flexibility in future moves.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs any food adjacent to the head now?\n- Head at (3,5).\n- Food at (5,2) and (5,4): neither is adjacent (adjacent would be same x or y with distance 1).\nSo no immediate food to eat this turn.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBoth D and R are safe and equally good in terms of distance to food. Since the snake is currently facing right, and moving right is a natural continuation, and doesn't lead to any immediate dead ends, let's choose R.\n\n**Action:** R\n\n\\boxed{R}",

However:\n\n- **Current direction**: Right (R)\n- **No instant reverse**: Cannot move Left (opposite of Right) next. So possible moves are U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (5,5)\n\n- New head position: (5,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is the right border, so x=5 is safe.\n  - Body: Current body segments are (3,5), (2,5), (2,6). (5,5) is not in these, so no body collision.\n  - Tail: Tail is at (2,6). Moving to (5,5) is not adjacent to tail unless the tail moves into a position that would collide next turn, but that's not immediate.\n  \n- Food at (5,5)? No, no food there.\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (4,6)\n\n- New head position: (4,6)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is top border, y=6 is safe.\n  - Body: (4,6) is not in [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6)], so no collision.\n  \n- Food at (4,6)? No.\n  \nSafe move, no food.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (4,4)\n\n- New head position: (4,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is bottom, y=4 is safe.\n  - Body: (4,4) is not in body segments.\n  \n- Food at (4,4)? No, but there's food at (5,4) and (4,2).\n  \nThis is safe, and it moves closer to (5,4).\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or poses a risk.\n\n1. Food at (5,2):\n   - Life_span = 3, so it will disappear after turn 10 (current is 7).\n   - Distance from head (4,5) to (5,2): need to go right to x=5, then down to y=2.\n   - Not immediately reachable in one move.\n\n2. Food at (5,4):\n   - Life_span = 7, disappears after turn 14.\n   - Current head at (4,5), food at (5,4).\n   - To reach (5,4) from (4,5):\n     - First move: Right to (5,5), then Down to (5,4).\n     - Or Down to (4,4), then Right to (5,4).\n   - So not directly eatable in one move, but moving Down to (4,4) sets up to go Right next to (5,4).\n\n3. Food at (4,2):\n   - Life_span = 10, disappears after turn 17.\n   - From (4,5), need to go Down three steps to (4,2).\n   - Not immediately reachable.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food on the tail?\n\n- Tail is at (2,6).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (1,6), (3,6), (2,5), (2,7) — but (2,7) is out of bounds (y=7 is wall).\n- Head is at (4,5), not adjacent to (2,6), so no immediate danger here.\n\n### Best Immediate Action\n\nFrom the possible moves:\n\n- Right (R) to (5,5): safe, no food.\n- Up (U) to (4,6): safe, no food.\n- Down (D) to (4,4): safe, moves closer to food at (5,4).\n\nMoving Down seems the best as it positions the snake to potentially eat the food at (5,4) next turn by moving Right.\n\n### Verifying Safety After Down Move\n\nAfter moving Down to (4,4):\n\n- New head: (4,4)\n- Body: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) — tail is (2,5) now (since the tail moves forward from (2,6) to (2,5)).\n  \nNext possible moves from (4,4):\n\n- Cannot go Up (reverse of Down), so can go Left, Right, Down.\n  \nThen can go Right to (5,4) to eat the food there.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\nIs there any risk in moving Down now that could lead to a trap later?\n\n- After Down to (4,4), then Right to (5,4):\n  - Eats food at (5,4), snake grows to length 5.\n  - New tail would be where the old tail was, which is (2,5).\n  - Head at (5,4), body: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5).\n  - Then possible moves from (5,4): cannot go Left (reverse of Right), so Up, Down, Right.\n    - Up to (5,5): safe.\n    - Down to (5,3): safe (no walls or body there).\n    - Right to (6,4): safe (x=6 is not a wall yet).\n  \nNo immediate traps seen.\n\n### Alternative Consideration: Moving Right First\n\nAlternatively, if we move Right now to (5,5):\n\n- Next turn, can go Right to (6,5), Down to (5,4), or Up to (5,6).\n  \nGoing Down to (5,4) would eat the food there, but then the snake's body would be:\n\n- Head at (5,4), body: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5).\n  \nThen next moves from (5,4):\n\n- Cannot go Up (reverse of Down), so Left, Right, Down.\n  - Left to (4,4): safe.\n  - Right to (6,4): safe.\n  - Down to (5,3): safe.\n\nThis also seems safe, but it's one extra move to get to the food compared to moving Down now then Right next.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween moving Down now then Right next (two moves to eat food) vs moving Right now then Down next (also two moves to eat food), both seem safe. \n\nHowever, moving Down first seems slightly better because:\n\n- After Down to (4,4), the next move Right to (5,4) is straightforward.\n- Moving Right first to (5,5) then Down to (5,4) leaves the snake's body in a position where the next moves are slightly more constrained (especially if we want to avoid getting boxed in near the right wall).\n\n### Final Choice\n\nAfter considering all options, the best immediate action is to move **Down (D)** to (4,4), setting up to eat the food at (5,4) next turn.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

(5,2) — value: 1, life_span: 1\n2. (4,2) — value: 1, life_span: 8\n\n### Possible Movements\n\nFrom the current head position (5,4), the snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is R (right), we cannot instantly reverse to Left (L) on the next move. So, possible moves are U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (6,4)\n- New head position: (6,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is a wall, so x=6 is safe (not a wall).\n  - Body: The body segments are at (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). (6,4) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n- Food at (6,4)? No, the foods are at (5,2) and (4,2).\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (5,5)\n- New head position: (5,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the top wall, y=5 is safe.\n  - Body: (5,5) is not in the body segments [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] — wait, is (4,5) adjacent? No, (5,5) is not in the body.\n- Food at (5,5)? No.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (5,3)\n- New head position: (5,3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is the bottom wall, y=3 is safe.\n  - Body: (5,3) is not in the body segments.\n- Food at (5,3)? No.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\nWait a minute, none of the immediate moves lead to food. But let's look at the food positions:\n\n- Food at (5,2): value 1, life_span 1 (will disappear after this turn)\n- Food at (4,2): value 1, life_span 8\n\nCurrently, the head is at (5,4). To reach (5,2), we'd need to move down twice, but we can only move one step at a time. Similarly, to reach (4,2), we'd need to move left then down.\n\nGiven that the food at (5,2) will disappear after this turn (life_span 1), it's not reachable in this move because we can't get to (5,2) from (5,4) in one move (we'd need to go to (5,3) first).\n\nThe food at (4,2) is more reachable in future turns, but not immediately.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe tail is at (2,5). Is there any positive food adjacent to the tail that could be dangerous if eaten?\n\nFood positions:\n- (5,2): not adjacent to tail (distance is |5-2| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6)\n- (4,2): not adjacent to tail (distance is |4-2| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5)\n\nNo food is adjacent to the tail, so no immediate danger from that.\n\n### Evaluating Best Move\n\nSince none of the immediate moves lead to food, and all possible moves are safe, we should choose a move that positions the snake to potentially reach food in future turns, especially the food at (4,2) which has a longer life span.\n\nCurrent head at (5,4). To reach (4,2):\n- First move left to (4,4), then down to (4,3), then down to (4,2).\n\nAlternatively, first move down to (5,3), then left to (4,3), then down to (4,2).\n\nBetween moving left (L) or down (D) first, moving left seems better because it gets us closer to the x-coordinate of the food at (4,2).\n\nBut wait, we cannot move left because the current direction is R (right), and moving left would be an instant reverse (from R to L), which is not allowed.\n\nSo, from current direction R, possible moves are U, D, R.\n\nBetween U, D, R:\n- R: moves away from food (towards x=6)\n- U: moves to (5,5) — not helpful for food)\n- D: moves to (5,3) — next move could be L to (4,3), then D to (4,2)\n\nSo, moving down seems the best to eventually reach the food at (4,2).\n\n### Verifying Down Move\n\nMove D to (5,3):\n- New head: (5,3)\n- Body becomes: [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)] — tail (2,5) is removed (since length doesn't increase)\n- Next turn, from (5,3), direction is D, can move L, R, D (not U)\n  - L to (4,3)\n    - Then D to (4,2) to eat food.\n\nThis seems like a viable path to the food.\n\n### Alternative Consideration: Food Under Body\n\nIs there any food under the snake's body that could be eaten if we move away?\n\nCurrent body segments:\n- (5,4) — head\n- (4,4)\n- (4,5)\n- (3,5)\n- (2,5) — tail\n\nFood is at (5,2) and (4,2) — neither is under the body.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate move is Down (D), which is safe and positions the snake to potentially reach the food at (4,2) in subsequent moves.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's visualize the current state of the game based on the provided information.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, indicating an 8x8 grid (since coordinates likely range from 0 to 7 inclusive).\n   \n2. **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal obstacle at (3, 1).\n\n3. **Snake Positions**:\n   - Head: (5, 3)\n   - Body segments in order: (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 5)\n   \n   So, the snake's body forms the following path:\n   - (5,3) → (5,4) → (4,4) → (4,5) → (3,5)\n\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Down (\"D\"). This means the last move was from (5,4) to (5,3) (since moving Down decreases the y-coordinate).\n\n5. **Food Items**:\n   - Food at (4, 2): value = 8, life_span = 1\n     - This means it provides +1 score, increases length by 1, and will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n   - Food at (5, 1): value = 10, life_span = 1\n     - Similarly, +1 score, length +1, disappears after this turn.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, we must consider:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Down (\"D\"), the snake cannot move Up (\"U\") next, as that would be the reverse direction.\n\nSo, possible moves are: Down, Left, Right.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move's outcome.\n\n#### 1. Move Down (\"D\") - to (5, 2)\n\n- New head position: (5, 2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is the lower wall. (5,2) is not a wall (y=2 ≠ 0).\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,1) is not (5,2).\n  - Body collision: The body segments are at (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5). (5,2) is not in this list.\n- Food check:\n  - Is (5,2) a food position? No, foods are at (4,2) and (5,1).\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (\"L\") - to (4, 3)\n\n- New head position: (4, 3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is the left wall. (4,3) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,1) is not (4,3).\n  - Body collision: Check if (4,3) is in body segments. Current body: (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5). (4,3) is not present.\n- Food check:\n  - Is (4,3) a food position? No.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (\"R\") - to (6, 3)\n\n- New head position: (6, 3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is the right wall. (6,3) is not a wall (x=6 ≠ 7).\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,1) is not (6,3).\n  - Body collision: (6,3) is not in body segments.\n- Food check:\n  - Is (6,3) a food position? No.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food can be eaten in the next move.\n\n1. **Food at (4, 2)**:\n   - Current head at (5,3). To reach (4,2), the snake would need to move Left then Down, or Down then Left, but not in one move.\n   - Cannot be eaten this turn.\n\n2. **Food at (5, 1)**:\n   - Current head at (5,3). To reach (5,1), the snake would need to move Down twice.\n   - First move Down to (5,2), then next turn Down to (5,1).\n   - Cannot be eaten this turn.\n\nHowever, there's a special case where food can be under the snake's body. Let's check if any food is under the snake's body:\n\n- Snake body positions: (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)\n- Foods at (4,2) and (5,1): neither is under the snake's body.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe also need to check if moving towards the tail could cause a collision after growth.\n\nThe tail is at (3,5). Adjacent cells to the tail:\n- Up: (3,6)\n- Down: (3,4)\n- Left: (2,5)\n- Right: (4,5)\n\nOur head is at (5,3), which is not adjacent to the tail (distance is more than 1 in both x and y). So, no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nAll three possible moves (D, L, R) are safe in terms of collisions. Now, let's consider which move positions us better for future food collection.\n\n1. **Move Down (\"D\") to (5,2)**:\n   - Next turn, could move Down to (5,1) to eat the food there (if it hasn't disappeared).\n   - Or move Left to (4,2) to eat the other food (but food at (4,2) disappears after this turn, so next turn it won't be there).\n\n2. **Move Left (\"L\") to (4,3)**:\n   - Next turn, could move Down to (4,2), but food at (4,2) will be gone.\n   - Or other moves, but no immediate food access.\n\n3. **Move Right (\"R\") to (6,3)**:\n   - Moves away from both foods; not optimal.\n\nGiven that the food at (5,1) will disappear after this turn if not eaten, but we can't reach it this turn, the best we can do is position ourselves to potentially eat it next turn if it remains (though its life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn).\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,2) will disappear after this turn, so we can't reach it in time.\n\nThus, none of the moves allow us to eat food this turn, and the foods will disappear next turn regardless. Therefore, any safe move is equally good in terms of immediate scoring.\n\nHowever, moving Down (\"D\") to (5,2) at least keeps the option open to move to (5,1) next turn if by some chance the food remains (though per rules, it should disappear). Alternatively, moving Left (\"L\") to (4,3) might position us better for other potential future foods, but without future food info, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven no immediate food can be eaten, and all moves are safe, choosing a move that doesn't box us in is preferable. Moving Left seems slightly better as it keeps more space open on the right side of the grid.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the safest move that doesn't lead to immediate danger and maintains flexibility is:\n\n\\boxed{L}",

So, the snake cannot move outside these borders.\n   - Internal obstacle at (3, 1).\n\n2. **Snake Details**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5)]\n     - Head at (4, 3), next segment at (5, 3), and so on, with tail at (4, 5).\n   - Current direction: Left (L). This means the snake was moving left in the previous turn, so it came from (5, 3) to (4, 3).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (4, 2): value = 1, life_span = 7\n   - (5, 1): value = 1, life_span = 9\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n- **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot move Right (R) in the next turn.\n  \nSo, possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for safety and potential rewards.\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) to (3, 3)\n- New head position: (3, 3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is a wall, but (3, 3) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacle: (3, 1) is an obstacle, but (3, 3) is not.\n  - Body collision: Snake body segments are at (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5). (3,3) is not in these, so no collision.\n- Food at (3, 3)? No, the foods are at (4,2) and (5,1).\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (4, 4)\n- New head position: (4, 4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the upper wall, (4,4) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacle: (3,1) is not at (4,4).\n  - Body collision: (4,4) is currently occupied by the snake's body (third segment). Moving here would mean the head collides with the body.\n  \nThis move is **not safe** because it causes a body collision.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (4, 2)\n- New head position: (4, 2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is the lower wall, (4,2) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacle: (3,1) is not at (4,2).\n  - Body collision: Snake body is at (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5). (4,2) is not in these.\n- Food at (4, 2)? Yes, there's positive food with value +1.\n  \nNow, check the **Tail Reward Danger**:\n- After eating, the snake's length increases by 1. The current tail is at (4,5). After moving:\n  - New head at (4,2), body becomes [(4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)].\n  - Then, the tail moves forward, so the new tail is at (5,3), and the segment at (4,5) is removed.\n  - Is the head adjacent to the new tail? Head at (4,2), new tail at (5,3). Adjacent means one coordinate differs by 1. Here, x differs by 1 and y differs by 1, so it's diagonally adjacent, which is not considered adjacent in the usual 4-directional movement (only up, down, left, right). So, no adjacency.\n  \nTherefore, eating this food is safe.\n\n### Comparing Possible Moves\n\n- Left (L): Safe, no food.\n- Down (D): Safe, eats positive food.\n- Up (U): Unsafe.\n\nBetween Left and Down, Down is better because it allows eating positive food without any danger.\n\n### Verifying Other Considerations\n\nIs there any other food we can aim for in future moves?\n- The other food is at (5,1). From (4,3), to reach (5,1):\n  - One path could be: Down to (4,2), then Left to (3,2), then Down to (3,1) - but (3,1) is an obstacle.\n  - Another path: Down to (4,2), then Right to (5,2), then Down to (5,1).\n  \nBut currently, the immediate best move is Down to eat the food at (4,2), which also positions us to potentially go towards (5,1) next.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down (D) to eat the positive food at (4,2) safely.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

(4,1) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n   - Check for food:\n     - Food is at (5,1), not (4,1), so no food eaten.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no score change.\n\n2. **Move Left (\"L\") to (3,2)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=0 is a wall, (3,2) is not a wall.\n     - Internal obstacle: There's an obstacle at (3,1), but we're moving to (3,2), so no collision.\n     - Body segments: (3,2) is not in the body list, so safe.\n   - Check for food:\n     - No food at (3,2).\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no score change.\n\n3. **Move Right (\"R\") to (5,2)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is a wall, (5,2) is not a wall.\n     - Body segments: (5,2) is not in the body list, so safe.\n   - Check for food:\n     - Food is at (5,1), not (5,2), so no food eaten.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no score change.\n\n### Considering the Food\n\nThe food is at (5,1), which is positive (+1 score, length increases by 1). Currently, the head is at (4,2). To reach the food at (5,1):\n\nFrom (4,2):\n- Down to (4,1), then Right to (5,1): But after moving Down to (4,1), next move would be from (4,1), and Right would take us to (5,1), which is the food.\nHowever, we're only deciding the immediate next move, not planning ahead.\n\nBut is there a way to get to the food in one move? No, because from (4,2), moving Right takes us to (5,2), and from there, Down would take us to (5,1) next. But again, we're only deciding the immediate move.\n\nAlternatively, moving Down to (4,1), then Right to (5,1) next turn would get us the food. But is that safe?\n\nAfter moving Down to (4,1), the snake's new positions would be:\nHead: (4,1)\nBody: [(4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\nTail was at (4,5), which moves away, so (4,5) is now empty.\n\nThen next move could be Right to (5,1), eating the food:\n- New head at (5,1), which is the food.\n- Body grows to include (4,1), so new body is [(5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)].\n- Tail was at (4,4), which moves away, so no collision.\n\nBut we need to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and the tail cell has positive food?\nCurrent tail is at (4,5), which is not adjacent to head at (4,2) (they are 3 units apart in y), so no danger here.\n\nBut in the next step after moving Down to (4,1), tail is at (4,4), which is adjacent to (4,1)? Wait, no, adjacency is immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right). (4,1) and (4,4) are not adjacent (they are 3 apart in y), so no.\n\nBut let's think about the immediate move: moving Down to (4,1) seems safe, and sets us up to get the food next turn by moving Right.\n\nAlternatively, moving Right to (5,2) now, then Down to (5,1) next turn would also get the food. Both sequences seem valid.\n\nIs one better than the other?\n\nLooking at the snake's body after moving Down to (4,1):\nBody: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\nThen moving Right to (5,1) would make the body: [(5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\nThis seems okay.\n\nAfter moving Right to (5,2) now:\nBody: [(5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\nThen moving Down to (5,1) would make the body: [(5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\nAlso okay.\n\nBoth sequences lead to eating the food next turn. Is there any immediate advantage to one over the other?\n\nLooking at the current body positions, moving Down to (4,1) might be slightly better because it keeps the snake more compact, whereas moving Right to (5,2) stretches it out more, potentially limiting future moves.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs there any food that can be eaten immediately in the next move? Currently, the food is at (5,1), and the head is at (4,2). To eat it immediately, the head would have to be at (5,1) in the next move, but from (4,2), no single move takes us to (5,1). So no immediate eating possible.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nGiven that all three possible moves are safe and none lead to immediate food consumption, the best strategy is to choose a move that positions the snake to eat the food in the next turn.\n\nBetween moving Down to (4,1) or Right to (5,2), both set up for eating the food next turn. Moving Down seems slightly better as it keeps the snake more compact.\n\nMoving Left to (3,2) doesn't help in getting closer to the food, so it's less optimal.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **Down (\"D\")** to (4,1), setting up to move Right to (5,1) next turn to eat the food.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn (t₀):** 13\n\n**Walls:**\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7 (left and right edges), y=0, y=7 (bottom and top edges).\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 1) — so we can't move to this cell.\n\n**Snake Positions:**\nThe snake's body is represented as a list from head to tail:\n1. Head: (4, 1)\n2. (4, 2)\n3. (4, 3)\n4. (5, 3)\n5. (5, 4)\n6. Tail: (4, 4)\n\n**Snake Head Direction:** Currently moving Down (D). This means the last move was downward, so the head moved from (4, 2) to (4, 1).\n\n**Food:**\n1. (5, 1) — value: +1, life span: 7\n2. (4, 3) — value: +1, life span: 10\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4, 1) and direction D (down), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U):** (4, 1) → (4, 2)\n- **Left (L):** (4, 1) → (3, 1)\n- **Right (R):** (4, 1) → (5, 1)\n\nWe cannot move Down (D) because that would be the opposite of the current direction (from D to U is allowed, but D to D is not a change, and D to U is allowed unless there's a no instant reverse rule which says you can't go opposite, but here D to U is not opposite, U and D are opposites. Wait, let's clarify:\n\nCurrent direction is D (down), meaning the head was at (4,2) and moved to (4,1) (down). The next move cannot be U (up), because that would reverse the direction instantly (from down to up is opposite). So possible moves are L, R, or D (but D would continue downward, but from (4,1) down is (4,0), which is a wall (y=0 is a border wall). So D is invalid because it hits the wall.\n\nWait, let's list possible moves from (4,1):\n\n- U: (4,2) — but current direction is D, so moving U is opposite, which is not allowed.\n- D: (4,0) — y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n- L: (3,1) — is this valid? (3,1) is an internal obstacle, so no.\n- R: (5,1) — is this valid? Let's check.\n\nSo the only possible move is R to (5,1).\n\nBut let me double-check the movement constraints:\n\n**Movement Constraints:**\n- Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is D, so cannot move U.\n- Other moves: D is into wall, L is into obstacle, so only R is possible.\n\nBut wait, is (5,1) safe to move into? Let's check:\n\n**Food at (5,1):** value +1, life span 7.\n\nIf we move to (5,1), we eat this food. What happens then:\n- Length increases by 1.\n- New head: (5,1)\n- Body grows: the tail (4,4) does not move, so new body is [(5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)].\n\nNow, is there any collision after this move?\n\nNew head is at (5,1), body segments are (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4). Is (5,1) in the body? No, none of the body segments are at (5,1). So no collision.\n\nAlso, no wall at (5,1), and no obstacle there.\n\nNow, is there any \"Tail Reward Danger\"? That is, is the head adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food?\n\nCurrent tail is at (4,4). Adjacent cells to head (4,1) are (3,1), (5,1), (4,0), (4,2). (4,4) is not adjacent to (4,1), so no danger.\n\nNow, the other food is at (4,3), which is currently under the snake's body. It can only be eaten if:\n1. The body moves away, and\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nCurrently, (4,3) is occupied by the snake's body, so we can't eat it now.\n\n### Evaluating the Move to (5,1)\n\nMoving R to (5,1):\n- Eats positive food (+1 score, length +1).\n- No collision.\n- No immediate danger.\n\nIs there any other possible move? As reasoned earlier, only R is possible; others are invalid due to walls, obstacles, or opposite direction.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Collisions After Move\n\nAfter moving R to (5,1), the new snake positions:\n- Head: (5,1)\n- Body: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)\n\nNext possible moves from (5,1):\nCurrent direction is R (since we moved R from (4,1) to (5,1)).\n\nNext turn cannot move L (opposite of R).\nPossible moves from (5,1):\n- U: (5,2)\n- D: (5,0) — wall, invalid\n- R: (6,1) — x=6 is not a wall (walls are x=0,7), but is (6,1) occupied by body? Current body is (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4). No, so R is possible next.\n- L: cannot, opposite.\n\nSo next turn could go U or R. Seems safe.\n\n### Alternative Considerations\n\nIs there any reason not to eat the food at (5,1)? Only if it leads to a trap later, but seems safe for now.\n\nThe other food at (4,3) is under the body, so we can't eat it now. Maybe later if body moves away.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only valid and safe move is to go Right (R) to (5,1), eating the positive food there.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Assuming it's a positive food with value +1 and lifespan 9, but the format shows \"value1, life_span1\" as separate. Maybe it's (x, y, value, life_span), so (4, 3, 9, 1) means value=9, life_span=1.\n  - Lifespan: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten).\n\n### Visual Representation\n\nLet me try to sketch the grid (rows y=0 to y=7, columns x=0 to x=7):\n\n```\ny\\x 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n7 |W W W W W W W W\n6 |W           W\n5 |W           W\n4 |W     S S S W\n3 |W     S F S W\n2 |W     S     W\n1 |W   W S H   W\n0 |W W W W W W W W\n```\n\n- W: Wall\n- H: Head at (5,1)\n- S: Snake body\n- F: Food at (4,3)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n- **No instant reverse**: Current direction is Right (R), so cannot move Left (L) next.\n- **Wall and body collisions**: Must avoid moving into walls or body segments (except the tail under specific conditions).\n\n**Current head position**: (5,1), direction R.\n\n**Possible moves from (5,1)**:\n1. **Right (R)**: (6,1)\n   - Check: x=6 is not a wall (x=7 is), no body at (6,1).\n   - Valid.\n2. **Up (U)**: (5,2)\n   - Check: (5,2) is not a wall, no body there.\n   - Valid.\n3. **Down (D)**: (5,0)\n   - Check: y=0 is a wall.\n   - Invalid (wall).\n4. **Left (L)**: (4,1)\n   - Check: Opposite of current direction (R), so invalid by no instant reverse rule.\n   - Invalid.\n\nSo, possible moves: R or U.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\n**Option 1: Right (R) to (6,1)**\n- New head position: (6,1)\n- Tail moves forward: The tail is at (4,4). After moving, the new tail will be at (4,1) (since the body is [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)] and the last segment is removed).\n- Food at (4,3): Not eaten (head doesn't move there).\n- No collision.\n- Next turn: Head at (6,1), direction R.\n\n**Option 2: Up (U) to (5,2)**\n- New head position: (5,2)\n- Tail moves forward: New tail at (4,1).\n- Food at (4,3): Not eaten.\n- No collision.\n- Next turn: Head at (5,2), direction U.\n\n### Considering the Food\n\nThere's food at (4,3):\n- Value: +9 (assuming positive, very high reward).\n- Lifespan: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten).\n- Current snake body covers (4,3), but the body is moving away (tail is at (4,4), so (4,3) is not the tail).\n  \nTo eat the food:\n- The head must move to (4,3) next turn.\n- Currently, head is at (5,1). To reach (4,3):\n  - From (5,1), can go U to (5,2), then L to (4,2), then U to (4,3).\n  - But food will disappear after this turn (lifespan=1), so cannot reach it in time.\n  \nThus, cannot eat the food this turn or next, so it will disappear.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the tail has positive food that could be dangerous:\n- Tail is at (4,4). Is there food at (4,4)? No, only at (4,3).\n- So no danger from tail food.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nBoth R and U are safe. Which is better?\n- Moving R:\n  - Goes towards the right wall (x=6), next move could be R to (7,1) which is a wall, so would have to turn then.\n- Moving U:\n  - Opens more space upwards, can potentially explore more area.\n\nGiven that the high-value food is inaccessible, and both moves are safe, moving U might be slightly better for future flexibility.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Danger\n\nAfter moving U to (5,2):\n- Next possible moves from (5,2):\n  - Current direction U, so cannot move D.\n  - Possible: U to (5,3) - but (5,3) is body (from current state, but after move, body will be [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)] - wait, no, let's reconstruct body after move U:\n\nAfter move U to (5,2):\n- New head: (5,2)\n- Body: [(5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n- Tail was (4,4), now removed, so new tail is (4,1).\n\nSo (5,3) is in the body, so cannot move U next.\nFrom (5,2), possible moves:\n- L to (4,2) - not opposite, not wall, not body (body has (4,2)? Wait, body is [(5,1), (4,1), (4,2), ...], so (4,2) is body - cannot.\n- R to (6,2) - not wall, not body - valid.\n- D to (5,1) - opposite of U - invalid.\nSo only R is possible next.\n\nThis seems limiting. Maybe moving R is better.\n\nAfter move R to (6,1):\n- New head: (6,1)\n- Body: [(5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n- Tail was (4,4), now removed, new tail (4,1).\n\nNext moves from (6,1):\n- Current direction R, cannot move L.\n- Possible:\n  - R to (7,1) - wall, invalid.\n  - U to (6,2) - not wall, not body - valid.\n  - D to (6,0) - wall, invalid.\nSo only U is possible next.\n\nStill limiting, but better than hitting body next.\n\nGiven that, both options lead to limited next moves, but R seems slightly better as it doesn't immediately box us in.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering both options, moving **Right (R)** seems the safer choice as it avoids immediate boxing in next turn compared to moving Up (U).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Wait, let's reconstruct:\n     - Original: [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n     - Move head to (6,2), remove tail (5,4), new snake:\n       - [(6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3)]\n   - Does this move eat any food?\n     - Food is at (4,3), which is now part of the body (but not the head), so no.\n   - Is there any immediate danger in the next move?\n     - Next head position is (6,2), adjacent to body segments: (6,1), (5,1), etc.\n     - No immediate collision unless we move into them next turn.\n\n2. **Move Down (D)**: (6,1) → (6,0)\n   - (6,0): y=0 is a border wall → collision.

Body moves away from (4,3).\n     2. Head moves onto (4,3).\n   - Currently, (4,3) is occupied by the snake, so body must move away first.\n   - Next turn, if we move such that (4,3) is no longer occupied, then we can try to move head there.\n   - But food will disappear after this turn, so we cannot eat it this turn or ever (since it's disappearing now).\n\nSo, the food at (4,3) is not reachable this turn and will disappear after this turn regardless.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food on the tail?\n- Tail is at (5,4).\n- Head is at (6,1).\n- Adjacent means one cell apart in any direction (including diagonally? Assuming only up, down, left, right):\n  - (6,1) adjacent to (5,1), (7,1), (6,0), (6,2).\n  - (5,4) is not adjacent to (6,1) (distance is (6-5=1, 1-4=3, total 1+3=4, not adjacent).\n- So no adjacency, no danger from tail food even if there was any (but there isn't).\n\n### Other Considerations\n\nAre there any other foods? No, only one at (4,3).\n\nAre there any immediate dangers in moving Up?\n- Moving to (6,2):\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not currently occupied by body.\n  - Next turn, possible moves from (6,2) would be (can't reverse, which would be Down from Up, but current move is Up, but initial direction was Right... Hmm, need to clarify direction after move.\n   - After moving Up from current direction Right, the new direction is Up.\n   - So next move cannot be Down (reverse of Up).\n   - Possible next moves: Left, Right, Up.\n   - From (6,2), possible moves:\n     - Left: (5,2) - check: not in body (body is [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3)]), not wall.\n     - Right: (7,2) - wall (x=7).\n     - Up: (6,3) - not in body, not wall.\n   - So no immediate dead ends.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly valid move is Up (U), which is safe and doesn't lead to immediate danger. The food is not reachable this turn and will disappear, so no need to consider it further.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the positions and constraints:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. So, the snake cannot move to these coordinates.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (3, 1).\n3. **Snake Positions**: The snake's body segments are listed in order from head to tail:\n   - Head: (6, 2)\n   - Body: (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 3)\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: Currently facing \"U\" (Up, which is increasing y-coordinate).\n5. **Food Items**:\n   - At (4, 3): value = 7, life_span = 1\n   - At (4, 4): value = 10, life_span = 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's body and food positions to better understand possible moves.\n\n- **Head at (6, 2)**:\n  - Current direction is Up (U), so the head is moving towards increasing y.\n- **Body Segments**:\n  - (6,1) - directly below the head.\n  - (5,1) - left of (6,1).\n  - (4,1) - left of (5,1).\n  - (4,2) - above (4,1).\n  - (4,3) - above (4,2). This is also where one food item is located.\n  - (5,3) - right of (4,3).\n  \n- **Food**:\n  - (4,3): On the body segment (4,3). This can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n  - (4,4): Not currently under the snake's body.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (6,2) with Direction U\n\nFrom the current head position (6,2) facing Up (U), the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Continue Up (U)**: Move to (6,3).\n   - Check if (6,3) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=6 is not 0 or 7; y=3 is not 0 or 7.\n     - Not a body segment: Check if (6,3) is in the snake's body.\n       - Current body: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3). (6,3) is not in this list.\n     - Valid move.\n2. **Turn Left (L)**: From Up, turning left means moving Left (L) to (5,2).\n   - Check (5,2):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not in body: (5,2) is not in the body list.\n     - Valid move.\n3. **Turn Right (R)**: From Up, turning right means moving Right (R) to (7,2).\n   - Check (7,2):\n     - x=7 is a border wall. Invalid move (would collide with wall).\n   - Cannot move Right.\n\n**Note**: Cannot move Down (D) because that's the opposite of current direction (U), which is not allowed.\n\nSo, possible moves: U or L.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nNow, let's evaluate the two possible moves:\n\n#### Move Up (U) to (6,3):\n\n- New head position: (6,3).\n- Food at (6,3)? No.\n- Next body segments:\n  - The tail (5,3) will move away (since the snake moves forward, the tail follows).\n  - No immediate food to eat.\n  - This move doesn't lead to eating any food immediately.\n  - It's a safe move but doesn't gain points.\n\n#### Move Left (L) to (5,2):\n\n- New head position: (5,2).\n- Food at (5,2)? No.\n- Next body segments:\n  - Tail is at (5,3), which will move to (4,3) (since the segment before it is (4,3)).\n  - Currently, (4,3) has food with value 7.\n    - After this move, the tail moves from (5,3) to (4,3), but the food is at (4,3).\n    - The food is under the body at (4,3), and the tail is moving to (4,3), so the food will be under the tail.\n    - To eat this food, the head would need to move to (4,3) after the tail moves away.\n    - But next turn, the tail would have moved from (4,3), so (4,3) would be free if the head moves there.\n    - However, the food's life_span is 1, and it decreases this turn (t=16), so at t=17 it will disappear.\n    - So, we cannot eat this food because it will disappear before we can reach it.\n- The other food is at (4,4):\n  - From (5,2), possible next moves could be towards (4,2) or (5,3), etc., to eventually reach (4,4).\n  - But (4,4) also has life_span 1, so it will disappear at t=17.\n  - We cannot reach it in one move from (5,2).\n\nSo, moving Left doesn't immediately lead to eating food either, but it positions the snake towards the center where more food might appear.\n\n### Considering Food Life Spans\n\nBoth foods have life_span = 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases this turn). Therefore, neither food can be eaten in this turn or the next, as they will be gone by t=17.\n\nThus, the immediate action should focus on moving safely without the possibility of eating food this turn.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nFrom (6,2):\n\n- Moving Up (U) to (6,3):\n  - Next possible moves from (6,3):\n    - Continue Up to (6,4): Check if (6,4) is safe.\n    - Left to (5,3): (5,3) is currently the tail, which will move to (4,3), so (5,3) will be free next turn.\n    - Right to (7,3): x=7 is wall, invalid.\n  - Seems safe.\n  \n- Moving Left (L) to (5,2):\n  - Next possible moves from (5,2):\n    - Up to (5,3): (5,3) is tail now, will move to (4,3), so safe.\n    - Left to (4,2): (4,2) is in body (current body has (4,2)), but next turn the body will have moved, so need to see:\n      - Current body: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3).\n      - After moving head to (5,2), body becomes: (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3).\n      - So (4,2) is now the second-to-last segment; moving left to (4,2) would collide with body next turn.\n      - Hence, moving Left to (4,2) next would be dangerous.\n    - Down to (5,1): (5,1) is in body (current body has (5,1)), but after move, body will have (5,1) as the fourth segment.\n      - Moving down to (5,1) would collide with body.\n  - So from (5,2), only safe immediate next move would be Up to (5,3).\n\nThus, moving Left now limits future moves more than moving Up.\n\n### Decision Between U and L\n\n- **Move Up (U)**:\n  - Safe.\n  - Keeps more options open next turn.\n  \n- **Move Left (L)**:\n  - Also safe this turn.\n  - Limits next moves more (only safe move next would be Up to (5,3)).\n\nGiven that both moves are safe this turn, but moving Up keeps more options open next turn, it seems better to choose Up.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our current state:\n- Tail is at (5,3).\n- Adjacent cells to head (6,2):\n  - Up: (6,3) - not tail.\n  - Left: (5,2) - not tail.\n  - Right: (7,2) - wall.\n  - Down: (6,1) - body, not tail.\n- So, head is not adjacent to tail currently. No immediate danger here.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven that:\n- Both possible moves (U and L) are safe this turn.\n- Moving Up keeps more options open next turn.\n- Neither food\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 17  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, since x=7 and y=7 are borders)\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 1)\n\n**Snake Positions** (head first):\n1. Head: (6, 3)\n2. (6, 2)\n3. (6, 1)\n4. (5, 1)\n5. (4, 1)\n6. (4, 2)\n7. Tail: (4, 3)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: U (Up, which means the head is currently facing upwards, i.e., increasing y-coordinate)\n\n**Food**:\n1. (4, 3): value = 6, life_span = 1\n2. (4, 4): value = 9, life_span = 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the grid based on the given information. The grid is 6x6 (from (1,1) to (6,6)), with borders at x=0,7 and y=0,7.\n\n- Snake:\n  - Head at (6,3)\n  - Body segments:\n    - (6,2)\n    - (6,1)\n    - (5,1)\n    - (4,1)\n    - (4,2)\n    - Tail at (4,3)\n\n- Food:\n  - (4,3): This is currently under the tail of the snake (since tail is at (4,3))\n  - (4,4): This is one cell above the tail\n\n- Obstacle: (3,1) is blocked.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is U, the snake cannot instantly reverse to D (no instant reverse rule). So possible immediate moves are U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (6,3) → (6,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (6,4) is within bounds (x=1-6, y=1-6)\n     - Body: Check if (6,4) is in snake body. Current body segments are (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (6,4) is not in body. Safe.\n   - Check for food:\n     - (6,4): No food here.\n     - (4,4): Not moving onto it.\n   - Outcome: Moves to (6,4), no food eaten.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: (6,3) → (5,3)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (5,3) is within bounds.\n     - Body: (5,3) is not in body segments. Safe.\n   - Check for food:\n     - (5,3): No food here.\n   - Outcome: Moves to (5,3), no food eaten.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (6,3) → (7,3)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is a border wall. Cannot move here. This move would cause a wall collision. Invalid.\n   - Outcome: Cannot move right.\n\nSo, valid moves are U and L.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's consider the food:\n\n1. Food at (4,3):\n   - Currently under tail (4,3).\n   - To eat it:\n     - Tail must move away first, then head moves onto it next turn.\n     - Currently, tail is at (4,3). If the snake moves such that the tail moves away next turn, then head can move onto (4,3) in the following turn.\n     - But life_span is 1, so after this turn (t=17), it will disappear (since countdown decreases every turn including current). So at t=18, it's gone. Can't eat it.\n\n2. Food at (4,4):\n   - Life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn.\n   - To eat it now:\n     - Head must move onto (4,4) this turn.\n     - Current head is at (6,3). Possible moves to reach (4,4):\n       - From (6,3), can't reach (4,4) in one move (distance is 2 in x and 1 in y). So can't eat it this turn.\n\nSo, neither food can be eaten this turn due to their life_spans.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Tail is at (4,3) with food (positive, value=6).\n- Adjacent cells to tail (4,3):\n  - (3,3), (5,3), (4,2), (4,4)\n- Head is at (6,3). Is (6,3) adjacent to (4,3)? \n  - Distance is |6-4| + |3-3| = 2 + 0 = 2. Adjacent means distance 1, so no.\n- So head is not adjacent to tail. This rule doesn't apply here.\n\n### Deciding Between U and L\n\nBoth moves are safe in terms of not colliding and not eating any food this turn. Which is better?\n\nLooking ahead:\n- After U to (6,4):\n  - Next moves could be to approach other potential food or explore.\n- After L to (5,3):\n  - Next moves could be towards the center where more food might spawn or towards existing food paths.\n\nNeither seems immediately better, but moving left might keep the snake more centered, which is generally good for accessing future food.\n\nAlternatively, moving up might be slightly better because:\n- The snake's body is mostly on the left side (from (6,1) to (4,3)), so moving up might help in not boxing itself in.\n\nBut both seem reasonable. Since no food can be eaten this turn, and both moves are safe, I'll choose one that might keep options open next turn.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween U and L, both are safe. Let's choose **Left (L)** to move towards the center of the grid, which might offer more flexibility in future moves.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - Border cells are walls, meaning x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls.\n   - There's one internal obstacle at (3, 1).\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions (head first): [(5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2)].\n     - Head at (5, 3), next segment at (6, 3), and so on, with tail at (4, 2).\n   - Current head direction: Left (L).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - Food at (4, 3): value = 5, life_span = 1.\n   - Food at (4, 4): value = 8, life_span = 1.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, it cannot reverse its direction immediately. Since the current direction is Left (L), the opposite direction is Right (R), which is not allowed next. So, possible moves are U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Left (L)**: From (5, 3) to (4, 3).\n   - Check if (4, 3) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: (4, 3) is not a border or internal obstacle.\n     - Not colliding with body: Snake body segments are at (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2). (4,3) is not in this list, so safe.\n     - Food at (4,3): value = +5, life_span = 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten).\n     - Eating this food:\n       - New length: current length (7) +1 = 8.\n       - New head at (4,3), body extends to include old head (5,3), and tail moves away from (4,2).\n       - Check for Tail Reward Danger: Is the head adjacent to the tail after eating?\n         - Current tail is at (4,2). After eating, new tail would be at (4,1) (since the snake grows by one, the tail doesn't move).\n         - New head at (4,3), new tail at (4,1). Adjacent means same x and y differs by 1 or same y and x differs by 1.\n         - (4,3) and (4,1): same x, y differs by 2 (not adjacent).\n         - So no Tail Reward Danger.\n     - So moving Left to eat (4,3) is safe and beneficial (+5 score).\n\n2. **Up (U)**: From (5, 3) to (5, 4).\n   - Check if (5, 4) is valid:\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not in body: (5,4) not in [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)].\n     - Food at (5,4)? No, only foods at (4,3) and (4,4).\n     - So this is a safe move but doesn't eat food.\n   \n3. **Down (D)**: From (5, 3) to (5, 2).\n   - Check if (5, 2) is valid:\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not in body: (5,2) not in the body list.\n     - No food at (5,2).\n     - Safe move but no food.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- Left (L): Eats high-value food (+5), safe.\n- Up (U): Safe, no food.\n- Down (D): Safe, no food.\n\nThe food at (4,3) has a life_span of 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now. The other food at (4,4) also has life_span 1, but it's not reachable in one move from the current head position (from (5,3), can't reach (4,4) in one move: need to go Left to (4,3) then Up to (4,4), but that's two moves).\n\nSo the only food we can eat this turn is at (4,3), and it's a high-value food (+5). Eating it is safe and maximizes immediate score.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger Again\n\nJust to be thorough, let's confirm that eating (4,3) doesn't cause Tail Reward Danger:\n- Current tail is at (4,2).\n- After eating, new head at (4,3), new body includes (5,3), and tail was at (4,2), but since length increases by 1, the tail doesn't move (the segment before tail was (4,1), so new tail is still at (4,1)? Wait, let's see:\n\nCurrent body: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)] (length 7).\nAfter moving Left to (4,3) and eating:\nNew body: [(4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)] (length 8).\nWait, no: when snake moves and eats, the head moves to new position, all segments shift, and a new segment is added at the end (tail doesn't move, but the segment before tail is now the new tail? Wait, no, the tail moves forward unless the snake grows.\n\nActually, when snake eats, it grows by one, so the tail doesn't move. So after eating:\nNew head at (4,3), then (5,3), (6,3), ..., (4,1), and tail was at (4,2), but since length increases, tail stays at (4,2)? Wait, no, the tail is the last segment, which was (4,2), and the segment before was (4,1). After growing, the new tail is (4,1), and the segment that was tail (4,2) is now part of the body.\n\nWait, let's list it:\n\nOriginal body: H(5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), T(4,2).\nMove Left to (4,3), eat: new head at (4,3), then (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), and since length increases by 1, tail was at (4,2), now stays, but actually the new tail is (4,1), and (4,2) is now part of body.\n\nWait, no, the tail moves forward unless the snake grows. But when it eats, it grows, so tail doesn't move. So new tail is same as old tail? Or is it that the segment before tail becomes new tail?\n\nActually, the way snake growth works is: when it eats, the head moves forward to the new cell, all body segments shift forward, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move, effectively increasing length by 1.\n\nSo new body would be: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2). So tail is still at (4,2), but now length is 8.\n\nBut then the segment before tail is (4,1), which is adjacent to head at (4,3)? No, (4,1) and (4,3) are same x, y differs by 2, not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent to head is (5,3) (right), and (4,2) (down), and (4,4) (up, but not in body). (4,2) is the tail, which is safe to be adjacent unless there's food under it that we're eating, but we're not eating tail's food here.\n\nWait, Tail Reward Danger is when:\n- Head is adjacent to tail, and\n- Tail cell has positive food, and\n- We eat that food, causing head and newly grown tail to collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Current tail is at (4,2), which does not have food (food is at (4,3) and (4,4)).\n- After moving Left to (4,3), new head is at (4,3), tail is at (4,2) (since we ate, tail doesn't move).\n- Adjacent to head (4,3): (5,3), (4,4), (3,3), (4,2).

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn (t₀):** 19\n\n**Walls:**\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)), and the snake cannot go outside these bounds.\n- Internal obstacle: (3,1). The snake cannot move into this cell.\n\n**Snake Positions:**\nThe snake's body is represented as a list from head to tail:\n1. Head: (4, 3)\n2. (5, 3)\n3. (6, 3)\n4. (6, 2)\n5. (6, 1)\n6. (5, 1)\n7. (4, 1)\n8. (4, 2) ← Tail\n\n**Snake Head Direction:** L (Left). This means the snake was moving left in the previous move.\n\n**Food:**\n1. (4, 4): value = 7, life_span = 1\n   - This is positive food (+1 score, length +1).\n   - Life span is 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n2. (1, 6): value = 10, life_span = 1\n   - Also positive food.\n   - Life span is 1, will disappear after this turn.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No instant reverse:** Since the current direction is L (Left), the snake cannot move Right (R) in the next move. So, R is invalid.\n   \n   Valid moves to consider: U, D, L.\n\n2. **Wall and obstacle collision:** Check if moving in these directions would hit a wall or obstacle.\n\n   - Current head position: (4, 3)\n     - U (Up): (4, 3+1) = (4, 4)\n       - Check walls: y=7 is the upper border, so y=4 is within bounds.\n       - Internal obstacle: (3,1) is not (4,4), so safe.\n     - D (Down): (4, 3-1) = (4, 2)\n       - Check walls: y=0 is the lower border, so y=2 is within bounds.\n       - Internal obstacle: (3,1) is not (4,2), but (4,2) is the tail of the snake.\n     - L (Left): (4-1, 3) = (3, 3)\n       - Check walls: x=0 is the left border, so x=3 is within bounds.\n       - Internal obstacle: (3,1) is not (3,3), so safe.\n\n3. **Body collision:** Moving into any body segment except the tail is deadly.\n\n   - Current body segments (excluding head): (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)\n   \n   - U to (4,4):\n     - Is (4,4) in the body? No.\n   - D to (4,2):\n     - (4,2) is the tail. Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves forward, but we need to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n   - L to (3,3):\n     - Is (3,3) in the body? No.\n\n**Tail Reward Danger:**\nThis occurs if:\n- The head is adjacent to the tail, and\n- The tail cell has positive food, and\n- Eating it would cause the head and newly grown tail to collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Tail is at (4,2).\n- Is the head adjacent to the tail? Head is at (4,3), tail at (4,2). Yes, they are adjacent (directly below).\n- Does the tail cell have positive food? Currently, no food is listed at (4,2). The foods are at (4,4) and (1,6).\n  \nSo, no Tail Reward Danger here. Moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move away, and there's no food there to cause a collision after growth.\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nWe have two positive foods:\n1. (4,4): value=7, life=1\n   - If we move U to (4,4), we eat this food.\n   - Reward: +1 score, length increases by 1.\n   - This food will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n2. (1,6): value=10, life=1\n   - Currently at (4,3), moving to (1,6) is not possible in one move.\n   - We'd need multiple moves to reach it, but its life is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. Hence, we cannot eat it this turn.\n\nSo, the only food we can potentially eat this turn is at (4,4) by moving Up.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (4,4):**\n   - Eats the food at (4,4).\n   - New head: (4,4), body becomes: [(4,4), (4,3), (5,3), ..., (4,2)]\n   - Length increases by 1: new tail is (4,2) (old tail), but since length increases, the new tail would be the previous segment before (4,2), which is (4,1).\n   - Check for collisions after growth: new head is (4,4), new tail is (4,1). No immediate collision.\n   - No walls or obstacles in the way.\n   - Valid move with reward.\n\n2. **Move Down (D) to (4,2):**\n   - (4,2) is the tail.\n   - No food there, so no growth.\n   - Tail moves away, so new head: (4,2), body: [(4,2), (4,3), (5,3), ..., (4,1)]\n   - No collision, but no reward either.\n   - Safe but not beneficial unless avoiding something, which we're not here.\n\n3. **Move Left (L) to (3,3):**\n   - No food there.\n   - New head: (3,3), body: [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3), ..., (4,2)]\n   - No collision, no reward.\n   - Safe but not beneficial.\n\nBetween these, moving Up is the only move that gives us a reward this turn.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger if we move Up?\n\n- After moving Up to (4,4), the new head is at (4,4).\n- The body segments are: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2).\n- Is (4,4) overlapping with any body segment? No.\n- Is there any food under the body that could be dangerous next turn? Let's see:\n   - Current foods: (4,4) will be eaten, (1,6) is far away.\n   - No other foods are listed under the body.\n  \nNo immediate dangers detected.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nWhile we're only deciding the immediate move, it's good to think a step ahead to ensure we're not trapping ourselves.\n\nAfter moving Up to (4,4):\n- Next turn, head is at (4,4), direction is U.\n- Possible moves: U (to (4,5)), L (to (3,4)), R (to (5,4)) — cannot move D (opposite of U).\n- Checking walls:\n  - U to (4,5): within bounds.\n  - L to (3,4): within bounds, no obstacle.\n  - R to (5,4): within bounds.\n- Body segments: (4,3) is directly below the head, so moving D is invalid anyway.\n  \nSeems like we'll have options next turn as well.\n\n### Is There a Better Alternative?\n\nThe other food at (1,6) is too far to reach this turn, and it will disappear after this turn, so we can ignore it for now.\n\nNot moving towards the food at (4,4) means we lose the opportunity to gain a point this turn, with no immediate benefit.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up to eat the positive food at (4,4), gaining +1 score and increasing the snake's length safely.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand where everything is positioned.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (3, 1). The snake cannot move onto this cell.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head to the tail. \n     - Head: (4, 4)\n     - Body segments: (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2)\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving \"U\" (Up), meaning the last move was upwards.\n4. **Food**:\n   - There's one piece of food at (1, 6) with a value of 9 and a life span of 1. This means it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's body to understand its shape and possible movements.\n\n- Head at (4, 4)\n- Next segment at (4, 3) — directly below the head (since moving Up implies the head moved from (4, 3) to (4, 4))\n- Then the body goes to (5, 3), (6, 3), then down to (6, 2), (6, 1), then left to (5, 1), (4, 1), then up to (4, 2)\n\nThis forms a sort of \"S\" shape on the right side of the grid.\n\nThe food is at (1, 6), which is towards the upper-left part of the grid.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Up, the snake cannot move Down (D) next, as that would be a direct reverse.\n   - Allowed moves: U, L, R\n   - Disallowed move: D\n\n2. **Wall Collisions**: Check if moving in a direction would hit a wall.\n   - Current head: (4, 4)\n   - Up (U): (4, 5) — y=5 is within bounds (y=7 is wall), no wall at (4,5)\n   - Left (L): (3, 4) — x=3 is within bounds, no wall at (3,4)\n   - Right (R): (5, 4) — x=5 is within bounds, no wall at (5,4)\n\n3. **Body Collisions**: Check if moving in a direction would hit the body.\n   - Body segments (excluding the tail for now, since the tail will move): (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)\n   - Up (U): (4,5) — not in body\n   - Left (L): (3,4) — not in body\n   - Right (R): (5,4) — not in body\n\nAll three allowed moves (U, L, R) are safe in terms of walls and body collisions.\n\n### Considering the Food\n\nThere's positive food at (1, 6) with value 9 and life span 1. It will disappear after this turn, so we have one chance to eat it.\n\nCurrent head: (4,4)\nFood: (1,6)\n\nDistance: Δx = 1-4 = -3, Δy = 6-4 = 2\n\nTo reach the food in one move, the head would need to be adjacent to it, which it's not (since it's 3 left and 2 up). So we cannot eat it this turn directly.\n\nHowever, we can plan a path towards it. But since the food will disappear after this turn, we cannot eat it at all. Therefore, the food is effectively irrelevant for this turn's decision.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the tail has positive food that could be dangerous to eat next turn.\n\nTail is at (4,2). Is there food at (4,2)? Currently, the only food is at (1,6), so no. So no danger from tail food.\n\n### Possible Strategies\n\nSince the food is not reachable this turn, our goal is to stay alive and position ourselves for future food. \n\nPossible moves:\n- U: (4,5)\n- L: (3,4)\n- R: (5,4)\n\nWe should choose a move that maximizes future options and doesn't trap us.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Up (U)**:\n   - New head: (4,5)\n   - Next possible moves from (4,5): U (to (4,6)), L (to (3,5)), R (to (5,5))\n   - No immediate issues, but we're moving towards the top wall (y=7), which may limit future moves.\n\n2. **Left (L)**:\n   - New head: (3,4)\n   - Next possible moves from (3,4): U (to (3,5)), D (to (3,3)), L (to (2,4))\n     - Cannot move R (reverse of L)\n   - Moving left takes us towards the left wall (x=0), but we have space.\n\n3. **Right (R)**:\n   - New head: (5,4)\n   - Next possible moves from (5,4): U (to (5,5)), D (to (5,3)), R (to (6,4))\n     - Cannot move L (reverse of R)\n   - Moving right takes us towards the right wall (x=7), but we have space.\n\nAll three moves are safe. \n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nSince the food is not reachable, we should choose a move that doesn't lead us into a potential trap. \n\nLooking at the snake's body:\n- The body is mostly on the right side (from (4,3) to (6,3) down to (6,1) then left to (4,1) up to (4,2)).\n- Moving Left (L) takes us away from the body, potentially giving more space.\n- Moving Right (R) takes us closer to the body, which might limit future moves.\n- Moving Up (U) is okay but doesn't provide any particular advantage.\n\n**Left (L)** seems like the safest option as it moves the head away from the bulk of the body, giving more room to maneuver in future turns.\n\n### Verifying for Immediate Dangers\n\n- After moving Left to (3,4), the new body will be:\n  - Head: (3,4)\n  - Body: (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), ..., (4,2)\n  \nNext possible moves from (3,4):\n- U: (3,5) — check walls and body:\n  - Not a wall, not in body (body segments are at y<=4 except (4,2) which is at y=2)\n- D: (3,3) — check:\n  - Not a wall, not in body (body at y=3 is (5,3), (6,3), etc.)\n- L: (2,4) — check:\n  - Not a wall, not in body\n- Cannot move R (reverse)\n\nAll future moves seem safe after moving Left.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves and considering the current state, the safest and most strategic move is to go **Left (L)**.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

The possible moves from here are:\n- **Left (L)**: (2,4)\n- **Up (U)**: (3,5)\n- **Down (D)**: (3,3)\n  \nCannot move Right (R) because that's the opposite of Left (instant reverse is not allowed).\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) to (2,4)\n- Check if (2,4) is occupied by the snake's body:\n  - Snake body segments: (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1).\n  - (2,4) is not in this list.\n- Check if (2,4) is a wall:\n  - x=2 is not a border wall, and there are no internal obstacles at (2,4).\n- Conclusion: Safe to move Left.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (3,5)\n- Check if (3,5) is occupied by the snake's body:\n  - Not in the body segments list.\n- Check if (3,5) is a wall:\n  - y=5 is not a border wall, no internal obstacles here.\n- Conclusion: Safe to move Up.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (3,3)\n- Check if (3,3) is occupied by the snake's body:\n  - Body segments include (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), etc., but not (3,3).\n- Check if (3,3) is a wall:\n  - No walls here.\n- However, let's see where the tail is:\n  - Tail is at (4,1). Next move, the tail will move from (4,1) to (?,?), but since the snake grows only if it eats food, and we're not eating food here, the tail will move forward in the body chain.\n  - Actually, unless we eat food, the tail moves away, so no immediate collision with tail unless we're next to it and eat food.\n- Conclusion: Safe to move Down.\n\n### Food Consideration\n\nThe only food is at (1,6):\n- Current head at (3,4).\n- To reach (1,6):\n  - Need to move Up twice and Left twice, but food is quite far.\n  - Life_span is 8, so it will disappear at turn 21 + 8 = turn 29.\n  - Not immediately reachable in one move.\n\nNone of the immediate moves (Left to (2,4), Up to (3,5), Down to (3,3)) land on the food at (1,6), so we're not eating food this turn.\n\n### Avoiding Future Collisions\n\nWe should also consider future moves to avoid trapping ourselves:\n- Moving Left to (2,4):\n  - Next moves could be Left to (1,4), Up to (2,5), or Down to (2,3).\n- Moving Up to (3,5):\n  - Next moves could be Left to (2,5), Up to (3,6), or Right to (4,5) (but current direction is L, so R is opposite, not allowed next turn unless we change direction now).\n- Moving Down to (3,3):\n  - Next moves could be Left to (2,3), Down to (3,2), or Right to (4,3) (opposite, not allowed next turn).\n\nLooking at the snake's body, moving Down to (3,3) is close to the body segment at (4,3), but not immediately colliding. Moving Left seems safe as it's moving away from the body.\n\n### Decision\n\nSince none of the moves lead to immediate food, and all are safe, we can choose any. However, moving Left seems to be continuing in the current direction, which is often a safe default unless there's a reason to turn.\n\nBut let's think about space:\n- The snake is quite long (length 9), and the grid is 8x8 with walls.\n- Moving Left to (2,4) opens up space to the left side of the grid.\n- Moving Up or Down might eventually lead to more open areas.\n\nGiven that, moving Left seems reasonable to explore the left side where there's less snake body currently.\n\n### Final Check for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food on the tail?\n- Tail is at (4,1).\n- Head is at (3,4), not adjacent to (4,1) (distance is more than 1).\n- So no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe safest immediate action is to continue moving Left.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

The possible moves are:\n- Up (U)\n- Down (D)\n- Left (L)\n- Right (R)\n\nBut we cannot reverse direction immediately, so moving Right (R) is not allowed (since current direction is Left).\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move.\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) - (x-1, y)\nCurrent head: (2,4)\nNew head position: (1,4)\n\nCheck:\n- Is (1,4) a wall? No.\n- Is (1,4) part of the snake's body? Let's see the body segments:\n  - (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) - none at (1,4)\n- So, moving Left is safe in terms of collision.\n- Is there food at (1,4)? No food listed there.\n  \nSo, moving Left is safe but doesn't get us food.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) - (x, y+1)\nCurrent head: (2,4)\nNew head position: (2,5)\n\nCheck:\n- Is (2,5) a wall? y=5 is not a border wall, and no internal obstacle there.\n- Is (2,5) part of the body? Checking:\n  - (3,4), (4,4), etc. - no (2,5)\n- Food at (2,5)? No food listed there.\n  \nSafe move, no food.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) - (x, y-1)\nCurrent head: (2,4)\nNew head position: (2,3)\n\nCheck:\n- Is (2,3) a wall? No.\n- Part of body? Checking:\n  - (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), etc. - (4,3) is at y=3 but x=4, so no.\n- Food at (2,3)? No.\n\nSafe move, no food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nCurrently, the two foods are at:\n1. (1,6) - life span 7\n2. (1,1) - life span 10\n\nOur head is at (2,4). Let's see how to reach either food:\n\n**Food at (1,6):**\nCurrent: (2,4)\nTo reach (1,6):\n- Need to go left to x=1, then up to y=6.\nPossible path: Left to (1,4), then Up to (1,5), then Up to (1,6).\nBut this is multiple moves; we can only decide the immediate next move.\n\n**Food at (1,1):**\nCurrent: (2,4)\nTo reach (1,1):\n- Left to (1,4), then Down to (1,3), Down to (1,2), Down to (1,1).\nAgain, multiple moves needed.\n\nGiven that, in the immediate next move, none of the possible moves (L, U, D) directly reach food. So, we need to choose a move that might lead us towards food in future steps.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nIf we move Left to (1,4):\n- Next turn, from (1,4), possible moves (can't go Right):\n  - Up to (1,5)\n  - Down to (1,3)\n  - Left to (0,4) - but x=0 is a wall, so can't.\n  \nFrom (1,5), can then go Up to (1,6) to get the first food.\n\nFrom (1,3), can go Down to (1,2), then (1,1) for the second food.\n\nMoving Left seems to open paths to both foods.\n\nIf we move Up to (2,5):\n- Next moves could be Left to (1,5), then Up to (1,6).\nBut this is similar to moving Left first, then Up.\n\nMoving Down to (2,3):\n- Next moves could be Left to (1,3), then Down to (1,2), etc., towards (1,1).\n\nBoth Left and Up/Down can lead to food, but Left seems more central to reach both.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving Left to (1,4)?\n- Not colliding with body or walls.\n- No food there to cause tail reward danger (since no food is at (1,4)).\n\nSimilarly for Up and Down - no immediate dangers.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThis is a special case where if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our current state:\n- Tail is at (5,1).\n- Adjacent cells to head (2,4) are:\n  - Up: (2,5)\n  - Down: (2,3)\n  - Left: (1,4)\n  - Right: (3,4) - but can't go Right.\n  \nTail is at (5,1), which is not adjacent to head (distance is more than 1 in both x and y), so no tail reward danger in any move.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nGiven that:\n- Moving Left is safe and positions us to potentially reach both foods in future.\n- Moving Up or Down are also safe but don't offer a better immediate advantage.\n- Left seems more central to reach both foods eventually.\n\nAlso, the snake's body is currently extending towards the right and down, so moving left is moving away from the body, reducing immediate collision risks in future moves.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the safest and most strategic immediate move is to continue moving **Left**.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Therefore, the snake cannot continue moving left.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Direction (L)\n\nGiven the current direction is Left (L), the possible moves without instant reverse are:\n\n1. **Left (L)**: (x-1,y) → (0,4) — invalid (wall)\n2. **Up (U)**: (x,y+1) → (1,5)\n3. **Down (D)**: (x,y-1) → (1,3)\n\nCannot move Right (R) because that would be an instant reverse from Left.\n\nSo, possible actions: Up (U) or Down (D).\n\n### Checking Validity of Up (U) to (1,5)\n\n- New head position: (1,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body segments: Is (1,5) in [(2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)]? No.\n  - Walls: Is (1,5) a wall? No walls at this position.\n- Food at (1,5)? No food listed there.\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n### Checking Validity of Down (D) to (1,3)\n\n- New head position: (1,3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body segments: Is (1,3) in the body list? No.\n  - Walls: No walls at (1,3).\n- Food at (1,3)? No food listed there.\n  \nThis move is also safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n### Considering Food Positions\n\nThere are two food items:\n\n1. (1,6): value=1, life_span=6\n   - Distance from head (1,4): y increases by 2 (from 4 to 6), x same.\n   - To reach it, need to move Up twice: first to (1,5), then to (1,6).\n   - But current move can only be one step, so can't reach it immediately.\n2. (1,1): value=1, life_span=9\n   - Distance from head (1,4): y decreases by 3 (from 4 to 1), x same.\n   - Need to move Down three times: (1,3), (1,2), (1,1).\n   - Cannot reach immediately.\n\nNeither food can be eaten in the immediate next move.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe tail is at (6,1). Is the head adjacent to the tail?\n\nAdjacent means:\n- Same x, y ± 1: (6,0) or (6,2)\n- Same y, x ± 1: (5,1) or (7,1)\n\nHead is at (1,4), tail at (6,1). Not adjacent, so no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\nBoth Up and Down are safe moves that don't lead to immediate food. \n\nLooking ahead:\n\n- Moving Up to (1,5):\n  - Next move could be Up to (1,6) to eat the food there (if still present).\n  - Or Left to (0,5) — invalid (wall), Right to (2,5), or Down to (1,4) — but (1,4) is the current neck, so that would collide unless the tail moves away, which depends on the snake's length and movement.\n\n- Moving Down to (1,3):\n  - Next move could be Down to (1,2), then (1,1) to eat the food there.\n  - Or Left to (0,3) — invalid, Right to (2,3), or Up to (1,4).\n\nBetween the two, moving Down seems slightly better because it starts heading towards the food at (1,1), which has a longer life_span (9) compared to (1,6) with life_span 6. However, both foods have the same value.\n\nAlternatively, moving Up starts heading towards the food at (1,6), which might disappear sooner, but we can't reach it immediately anyway.\n\nGiven that both moves are safe and neither leads to immediate food, and considering that the snake is quite long (length 9), it might be prudent to start moving towards the food with the longer life_span to have more flexibility in future moves.\n\n### Decision\n\nAfter considering both options, moving Down starts the path towards the food at (1,1), which has a longer life_span, giving more time to reach it safely.\n\nTherefore, the immediate action should be:\n\n\\boxed{D}",

These are the edges of the grid.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: (3, 1). This is a single cell that the snake cannot move into.\n\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head to the tail:\n     - Head: (1, 3)\n     - Body: [(1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2)]\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving **Down (D)**, which means the last move was from a higher y-coordinate to a lower one. Specifically, the head moved from (1, 4) to (1, 3).\n\n4. **Food**:\n   - **Positive Food**: Both food items have a value of +1.\n     - (1, 6): life_span = 5\n     - (1, 1): life_span = 8\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better visualize, let's sketch a simple representation of the grid with the snake and food:\n\n```\ny=7: -----------------\n...\ny=6: |   | F |   |   | ... (F at (1,6))\ny=5: |   |   |   |   |\ny=4: | B | B | B | B | ... (Body segments at (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4))\ny=3: | H |   |   | B | ...

(F at (1,1), obstacle at (3,1))\ny=0: -----------------\n     x=0 x=1 x=2 x=3 ...\n```\n\n- H: Head at (1,3)\n- B: Body segments\n- F: Food\n- X: Internal obstacle at (3,1)\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position\n\nThe snake's head is at (1, 3), moving Down (D). The possible moves are:\n\n1. **Continue Down (D)**: (1, 2)\n   - Check if this is valid:\n     - Not a wall: y=2 is not a border (y=0 is the border).\n     - Not an internal obstacle: (1,2) is not (3,1).\n     - Not colliding with body:\n       - Current body segments: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2)\n       - (1,2) is not in this list.\n     - Valid move.\n\n2. **Turn Left (L)**: (0, 3)\n   - x=0 is a border wall. Invalid move (collision with wall).\n\n3. **Turn Right (R)**: (2, 3)\n   - Check validity:\n     - Not a wall: x=2 is not a border.\n     - Not an obstacle: (2,3) is not (3,1).\n     - Not colliding with body: (2,3) is not in body segments.\n     - Valid move.\n\n4. **Reverse Up (U)**: (1, 4)\n   - This is the opposite of current direction (D), which is not allowed (no instant reverse).\n   - Invalid move.\n\nSo, valid immediate moves are **Down (D)** and **Right (R)**.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions and their values:\n\n1. **Food at (1, 6)**:\n   - Value: +1\n   - Life_span: 5\n   - Distance from head (1,3):\n     - Manhattan distance: |1-1| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n   - To reach it, the snake would need to move upwards, but currently moving Down, and immediate reverse is not allowed. So, cannot head directly towards it now.\n\n2. **Food at (1, 1)**:\n   - Value: +1\n   - Life_span: 8\n   - Distance from head (1,3):\n     - Manhattan distance: |1-1| + |1-3| = 0 + 2 = 2\n   - To reach it, the snake needs to move Down twice:\n     - Current: (1,3) -> Down to (1,2)\n     - Next: (1,2) -> Down to (1,1)\n   - However, need to check if (1,1) is safe to eat:\n     - After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the tail doesn't move.\n     - Current tail is at (6,2). After eating, new tail is the old tail, so head at (1,1), body extends to (1,2), etc.\n     - Is (1,1) adjacent to tail (6,2)? No, |1-6| + |1-2| = 5 + 1 = 6 > 1, so no Tail Reward Danger.\n     - Also, no body collision at (1,1) currently.\n\n### Deciding the Move\n\nGiven the two valid moves:\n\n1. **Down (D) to (1,2)**:\n   - Moves towards the food at (1,1).\n   - Next move can be Down again to (1,1) to eat the food.\n   - No immediate risks in moving to (1,2).\n\n2. **Right (R) to (2,3)**:\n   - Moves away from both foods.\n   - Not immediately beneficial unless there's a longer-term plan to circle around, but as a non-thinking executor, we prioritize immediate safe moves towards food.\n\nGiven that moving Down is safe and progresses towards the food at (1,1), which is safe to eat next turn, this seems the better immediate choice.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nBefore finalizing Down, let's ensure there are no immediate dangers:\n\n- Moving to (1,2):\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not an obstacle.\n  - Not a body segment.\n  - After moving, the tail moves from (6,2) to the next segment (assuming the tail moves forward unless the snake eats, which it doesn't this turn).\n  - No risk of collision next turn when moving to (1,1) because:\n    - The new tail would be (6,3) (since the current tail is (6,2) and the segment before is (6,3)), but the head would be at (1,1), far from the tail.\n\n### Considering the Other Food\n\nThe food at (1,6) is not immediately accessible due to movement constraints (can't reverse), and its life_span is 5, which is longer than the time it would take to reach (1,1) and possibly turn around. However, as a non-thinking executor, we focus on the immediate best move, which is towards (1,1).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating both possible moves, moving **Down (D)** is the safest and most beneficial immediate action as it progresses towards the positive food at (1,1) without any immediate risks.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

From the current direction, the possible moves are:\n- **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (1, 1).\n- **Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (0, 2) → but x=0 is a wall, so invalid.\n- **Right (R)**: (x+1, y) → (2, 2).\n\nCannot move Up (U) because that's the opposite of Down (no instant reverse).\n\nSo, possible valid moves from (1, 2) with current direction D:\n- D: (1, 1)\n- R: (2, 2)\n\n### Checking Each Possible Move\n\n**Option 1: Move Down to (1, 1)**\n- (1, 1) is a food position with value=7, life_span=1.\n- Check if eating this food is safe:\n  - After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the new tail will be where the current tail is (6, 3).\n  - The new head is at (1, 1), and the new segment is added where the head was (1, 2).\n  - The tail moves from (6, 3) to (5, 3), etc.\n  - Need to ensure that the head doesn't collide with the new tail or any body part.\n    - Current body segments after head: (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3).\n    - After moving down and growing, the new body will be: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3). Wait, no: the head moves to (1,1), adds a new segment at (1,2), and the tail (6,3) is removed.\n    - So new body: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3).\n    - Check if (1,1) is in the new body segments after the move: no, it's only the head.\n    - Also, check if the new tail is adjacent to the head after eating:\n      - New tail is (5,3), head is (1,1). They are not adjacent (distance is |1-5| + |1-3| = 4 + 2 = 6), so no immediate collision.\n  - Also, (1,1) is not a wall or obstacle.\n- So moving Down to eat the food at (1,1) seems safe and gives +7 to score.\n\n**Option 2: Move Right to (2, 2)**\n- (2, 2) is not a food position.\n- Check if (2, 2) is safe:\n  - Not a wall or obstacle.\n  - Not in the current body segments: current body is from (1,3) onwards, so (2,2) is safe.\n  - After moving right, the head is at (2,2), tail moves from (6,3) to (5,3), etc.\n  - New body: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), ..., (5,3).\n  - No collision.\n- But this doesn't eat any food, so score remains the same.\n\n### Comparing the Options\n\n- Move Down to (1,1): eat food with value=7, safe.\n- Move Right to (2,2): no food, safe but no gain.\n\nClearly, moving Down to eat the high-value food at (1,1) is the better choice.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nOne special rule is \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Current tail is at (6,3).\n- Head is at (1,2), which is not adjacent to (6,3) (distance is 5 + 1 = 6).\n- The food is at (1,1), not at the tail, so this rule doesn't apply here.\n\n### Verifying Food Life Span\n\nAll foods have life_span=1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten. So we have this one chance to eat (1,1) or (1,6) or (6,6). (1,6) is at (1,6), which is not reachable this turn (from (1,2), can't go up because current direction is D, opposite is U which is not allowed). (6,6) is also not reachable in one move from (1,2).

So, the snake cannot move to these coordinates.\n- There's one internal obstacle at (3, 1).\n\n#### Snake:\n- Snake positions (head first): [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3)]\n  - Head: (1, 1)\n  - Tail: (6, 3)\n- Current direction: D (Down).

(1, 6): Not reachable in one move from (1,1).\n2. (6, 6): Not reachable in one move from (1,1).\n\nSo, moving right doesn't eat any food this turn.\n\n### Checking for Future Opportunities\n\nSince both foods have life_span = 1, they will disappear after this turn.

The possible moves from here are:\n\n- **Right (R)**: (4,3)\n- **Up (U)**: (3,4)\n- **Down (D)**: (3,2)\n\n**Note**: Since the snake is moving right, the opposite direction (Left, L) is not allowed to prevent an instant reverse.\n\n### Checking Each Possible Move\n\n#### 1. Right (R) to (4,3)\n- **Collision Check**:\n  - **Walls**: x=7 is the right border, but (4,3) is within bounds.\n  - **Body**: The snake's body segments are at (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4). \n    - (4,3) is not in the body list → safe.\n- **Food**: No food at (4,3).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Up (U) to (3,4)\n- **Collision Check**:\n  - **Walls**: y=7 is the top border, but (3,4) is within bounds.\n  - **Body**: (3,4) is the last segment of the snake's body → potential collision.\n    - However, according to the rules, the tail (last segment) will move forward when the snake moves. So, if the head moves to (3,4), the tail at (4,4) will move away, and the new tail will be at (3,4) after the move.\n    - But, the head is moving to (3,4), and the current tail is at (4,4). The head and tail won't occupy the same space at the same time because the tail moves away.\n    - **But** looking at the snake's body: [(3,3), (2,3), ..., (4,4)]. The segment before the tail is (3,4). So, (3,4) is already part of the body.\n    - **Correction**: The snake's body includes (3,4) → moving to (3,4) would mean the head collides with the body.\n- **Conclusion**: Not safe → collision with body.\n\n#### 3. Down (D) to (3,2)\n- **Collision Check**:\n  - **Walls**: y=0 is the bottom border, but (3,2) is within bounds.\n  - **Body**: Check if (3,2) is in the body segments → No.\n  - **Obstacle**: Internal obstacle at (3,1) → not relevant here.\n- **Food**: No food at (3,2).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nThe only food available is at (6,6). \n\n- **Distance**: Current head at (3,3). To reach (6,6), the snake needs to move right and up.\n- **Life Span**: The food has a life_span of 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n- **Feasibility**: \n  - From (3,3), the snake can move right to (4,3), but (6,6) is still far.\n  - It's not possible to reach (6,6) in one move → cannot eat it this turn.\n  \n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nThe rules mention a special case where if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\n- **Tail Position**: (4,4)\n- **Head Position**: (3,3)\n- **Adjacency**: (3,3) is adjacent to (4,4) (diagonally adjacent, but adjacency in Snake is usually up, down, left, right).\n  - **Clarification**: Typically, adjacency means Manhattan distance of 1 (up, down, left, right). So (3,3) is adjacent to (3,4), (3,2), (2,3), (4,3).\n  - (4,4) is diagonally adjacent → not considered adjacent in this context.\n- **Food on Tail**: There's no food mentioned at (4,4).\n  \n### Decision Making\n\nGiven the options:\n1. **Right (R)**: Safe, no reward.\n2. **Up (U)**: Unsafe → collision.\n3. **Down (D)**: Safe, no reward.\n\nSince the food at (6,6) is unreachable this turn and will disappear after this turn, it's not a factor. The only viable moves are Right and Down.\n\n**Choosing Between Right and Down**:\n- **Right**: Continues the current direction, which might be part of a longer path.\n- **Down**: Changes direction, but since there's no immediate benefit, it's a neutral choice.\n\nLooking at the snake's body, moving right to (4,3) seems safe and keeps options open for future moves.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the safest move is to continue moving **Right (R)**.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Move Up (U) to (4, 4)\n\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: (4, 4) is not a border wall (x=0/7 or y=0/7), and it's not the internal obstacle (3, 1).

Safe.\n- **Food**: No food at (4, 4). Just a safe move with no reward.\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Not applicable here since we're not eating any food.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (D) to (4, 2)\n\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: (4, 2) is not a border wall or internal obstacle. Safe.\n  - **Body**: (4, 2) is not in the body segments list. Safe.\n- **Food**: No food at (4, 2). Safe move with no reward.\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Not applicable.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (5, 3)\n\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: (5, 3) is not a border wall or internal obstacle. Safe.\n  - **Body**: (5, 3) is not in the body segments list. Safe.\n- **Food**: There is food at (5, 3) with value = 10, life_span = 1.\n  - Since the head is moving to (5, 3), and the current cell (4, 3) is not part of the body (it's the head), we can eat this food.\n  - **Tail Reward Danger**: The tail is at (3, 4). Is (5, 3) adjacent to the tail? Adjacent means one step in any direction (including diagonals). Distance between (5, 3) and (3, 4) is |5-3| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3, which is more than 1, so not adjacent. No danger.\n  - Eating this food gives +10 points and increases length by 1.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- **Up (U)**: Safe, no reward.\n- **Down (D)**: Safe, no reward.\n- **Right (R)**: Safe, +10 points, length +1.\n\nClearly, moving Right to eat the high-value food is the best immediate action.\n\n### Verifying Food Life Span\n\nBoth foods have life_span = 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten. So, if we don't eat (5, 3) now, it will be gone next turn.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers After Eating\n\nAfter eating (5, 3), the snake's new head is at (5, 3), and the tail remains at (3, 4) until the next move (since length increases by 1, the tail doesn't move this turn).

(6,3) is not in this list.\n     - Valid move.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: (5, 4)\n   - Check (5,4):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an obstacle.\n     - Not in body positions: Checking, (5,4) is not in the body list.\n     - Valid move.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: (5, 2)\n   - Check (5,2):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an obstacle.\n     - Not in body positions.\n     - Valid move.\n\n4. **Left (L)**: (4, 3)\n   - Check (4,3):\n     - Not a wall or obstacle.\n     - However, (4,3) is the first body segment after the head.\n     - Moving left would make the head collide with the body immediately after the tail moves (since the tail is at (3,4) and would move away).\n     - But the rule states: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is R, so L is opposite.\n     - Therefore, cannot move Left (instant reverse is not allowed).\n\nSo, possible immediate actions: R, U, D.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move based on the food and safety.\n\n**Food at (6,6)**:\n- Distance from head (5,3) to food (6,6):\n  - Manhattan distance: |6-5| + |6-3| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n- Life span is 4, so it will disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn, including current).\n- To reach the food in one move, we'd need to be adjacent, but we're not (distance is 4).\n- So, cannot eat the food this turn no matter what.\n\nThus, the food is not immediately accessible, and we should focus on moving safely towards it or another strategy.\n\n**Move Right (R) to (6,3)**:\n- New head: (6,3).\n- Body follows: head moves to (6,3), rest shift: (5,3), (4,3), ..., tail (2,4) is removed.\n- Check for future moves from (6,3):\n  - Possible directions: R (to (7,3) - but x=7 is a wall, so invalid.\n  - U: (6,4) - need to check if safe.\n  - D: (6,2) - safe.\n  - L: (5,3) - opposite of R, but current move is R, so next turn direction is R, so L is opposite, hence not allowed next turn.\n- So from (6,3), can go U or D next.\n- Not much progress towards food (6,6), but safe.\n\n**Move Up (U) to (5,4)**:\n- New head: (5,4).\n- Body follows: (5,3), (4,3), ..., tail (2,4) removed.\n- Next moves from (5,4):\n  - R: (6,4) - safe.\n  - U: (5,5) - safe.\n  - D: (5,3) - body is at (5,3) after this move, but tail is moving away, so safe.\n  - L: (4,4) - not opposite (current move is U, so next turn direction is U, opposite is D, so L is allowed).\n- Moving U gets us closer to food in y-direction (from y=3 to y=4).\n- Food is at y=6, so moving U is towards food.\n\n**Move Down (D) to (5,2)**:\n- New head: (5,2).\n- Body follows: (5,3), (4,3), ..., tail (2,4) removed.\n- Next moves from (5,2):\n  - R: (6,2) - safe.\n  - U: (5,3) - body is at (5,3), but tail moves away, so safe.\n  - D: (5,1) - safe.\n  - L: (4,2) - allowed.\n- Moving D takes us away from food (y=6), not desirable.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nWe must ensure that the chosen move doesn't lead to a collision in the next step or a dead end.\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Check if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food.\n  - Current tail is at (3,4).\n  - Adjacent cells to head (5,3): (5,4), (5,2), (4,3), (6,3).\n  - Tail is at (3,4), which is not adjacent to head (distance is |5-3| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3).\n  - So, no tail reward danger.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween R, U, D:\n\n- R: Safe, but not progressing towards food.\n- U: Safe, progresses towards food in y-direction.\n- D: Safe, but moves away from food.\n\nBest choice is **Up (U)**, as it moves towards the food while being safe.\n\n### Verifying Future Steps\n\nAfter U to (5,4):\n\nNext turn, food at (6,6) will have life span 3 (since current is 4, decreases by 1 this turn).\n\nFrom (5,4), possible moves towards food:\n\n- To reach (6,6), need to go right and up.\n- Next move could be R to (6,4), then U to (6,5), then U to (6,6).\n- But food life span is 4 now, will be 3 next turn, then 2, then 1, then 0.\n- So, can reach in 3 moves: U (now), R, U, U - but life span would be 4-3=1 when reaching (6,6), so possible.\n\nAlternatively, if we go U now, then U to (5,5), then R to (6,5), then U to (6,6) - also 3 moves.\n\nBoth paths seem possible, but immediate U seems better to start moving towards the food.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the best immediate action is to move **Up (U)**.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

This means the snake cannot move outside the grid.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (3, 1).\n\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body segments are listed from head to tail: \n     - Head: (5, 4)\n     - Body: (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4)\n   - **Length**: 12 segments.\n   - **Current Direction**: The head is moving Up (\"U\").\n\n4. **Food**:\n   - Only one piece of food is present at (6, 6) with:\n     - Value: 3 (positive food, so eating it gives +1 score and increases length by 1)\n     - Life Span: 1 (it will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better understand the snake's position and possible moves, let's visualize the grid (only showing relevant parts):\n\n```\ny=7 +-----------------+\n     |                 |\n     |                 |\ny=6  |           F(6,6)|\n     |                 |\ny=5  |                 |\n     |                 |\ny=4  |     H(5,4)      |\n     |           T(2,4)|\ny=3  |     B(5,3) B(4,3) B(3,3) B(2,3) \n     |                 B(2,2) B(2,1) B(1,1)\ny=2  |                 B(1,2) B(1,3) \n     |                 B(1,4)\ny=1  |     W(3,1)      |\n     |                 |\ny=0 +-----------------+\n     x=0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n```\n\n- H: Head at (5,4)\n- B: Body segments\n- T: Tail at (2,4)\n- F: Food at (6,6)\n- W: Wall at (3,1)\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position\n\nThe snake's head is at (5,4) moving Up (\"U\"). The possible moves are Up, Left, or Right (cannot move Down as it's the opposite of current direction).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: Move to (5,5)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (5,5) is within bounds (x=5, y=5 is not a border wall).\n     - Body: Check if (5,5) is in the snake's body segments. From the list, it's not.\n   - Food: No food at (5,5).\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: Move to (4,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (4,4) is within bounds.\n     - Body: Is (4,4) in the body? Checking the list: No.\n   - Food: No food at (4,4).\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: Move to (6,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (6,4) is within bounds (x=6 is not a border unless x=7).\n     - Body: Is (6,4) in the body? No.\n   - Food: No food at (6,4).\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nThe only food is at (6,6) with a life span of 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. \n\nTo eat the food, the snake needs to move its head to (6,6) this turn. Currently, the head is at (5,4). \n\nPossible paths to reach (6,6) in one move:\n- From (5,4), cannot reach (6,6) in one move (it's two steps right and two steps up).\n  \nThus, it's impossible to eat the food this turn, so we don't need to consider the food for immediate action.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule states: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nIn our case:\n- Tail is at (2,4).\n- Adjacent cells to head (5,4):\n  - Up: (5,5)\n  - Down: (5,3) - but cannot move Down.\n  - Left: (4,4)\n  - Right: (6,4)\n  \nTail is at (2,4), which is not adjacent to the head (distance is 3 in x-direction). So no tail reward danger.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nAll three possible moves (U, L, R) are safe in terms of not colliding with walls or body. None lead to food this turn. \n\nWe should choose a move that:\n1. Keeps the snake safe.\n2. Potentially positions the snake to reach food in future turns.\n\nLooking at the food at (6,6), moving Right (R) to (6,4) gets the head closer to the food's x-coordinate. Then next turn, could move Up twice to reach (6,6), but the food will be gone by then.\n\nAlternatively, moving Up (U) to (5,5) doesn't help much with the current food but might position for other potential food spawns.\n\nMoving Left (L) to (4,4) doesn't seem advantageous either.\n\nGiven that the food is unreachable this turn and all moves are safe, moving Right (R) seems slightly better as it moves the head towards the side where the food was, possibly anticipating new food spawns there.\n\nHowever, since the food is disappearing next turn and no immediate benefit is seen, any safe move is acceptable. \n\nBut let's think about the snake's body: moving Right to (6,4) doesn't block any immediate paths, whereas moving Up to (5,5) might limit future options if the body is long.\n\nGiven that, **Right (R)** seems like a reasonable choice to explore the right side of the grid where the food was, possibly indicating a less congested area.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Collisions\n\nBefore finalizing, ensure that moving Right:\n- New head position: (6,4)\n- Tail is at (2,4), will move to (1,4) next turn (assuming the snake doesn't eat, so tail moves forward).\n- No body segments at (6,4).\n- No walls at (6,4).\n\nAll safe.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, moving **Right (R)** is a safe and reasonable choice.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 35  \n**Grid Size**: Based on the border walls, it's an 8x8 grid (x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7).  \n**Internal Obstacle**: (3, 1) is a wall inside the grid.  \n**Snake Positions**: Head at (6, 5), followed by body segments down to (1, 3).  \n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Up (U).  \n**Food Items**:  \n1. (6, 6): value = 1, life_span = 1  \n2. (2, 6): value = 9, life_span = 1  \n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6, 5) moving Up (U), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (6, 6)  \n- **Left (L)**: (5, 5)  \n- **Right (R)**: (7, 5)  \n- **Down (D)**: (6, 4)  \n\nBut we cannot move in the opposite direction of the current movement unless it's allowed (but typically in Snake, you can't reverse direction instantly). Current direction is U, so Down (D) is opposite and likely not allowed. So possible moves: U, L, R.\n\n### Checking Each Possible Move\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (6, 6)**:\n   - (6, 6) has food with value 1, life_span 1.\n   - Check if eating is safe:\n     - After eating, snake grows by 1, so new tail will be where the current tail is (1, 3) moves to (1, 2), but the new tail is added where the head was (6, 5). So new positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), ...]\n     - Is the head adjacent to the tail? Tail is at (1, 2), head at (6,6) - no, not adjacent.\n     - No body collision: (6,6) is not in the current body segments.\n     - Not a wall: (6,6) is not a wall.\n   - Life_span is 1, so it disappears after this turn if not eaten now.\n   - Seems safe and beneficial to eat.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (5, 5)**:\n   - (5,5): No food here.\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not in body segments: body is at (6,4), (5,4), etc., not (5,5).\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (7, 5)**:\n   - (7,5): Border wall at x=7, so this is a wall. Can't move here.\n\n### Comparing Options\n\n- **Up (U)**: Eat positive food (+1), safe, food disappears next turn.\n- **Left (L)**: Safe but no reward.\n- **Right (R)**: Wall, invalid.\n\nBest immediate action is to go Up to eat the food at (6,6).\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule states: If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Current tail is at (1, 1) (last in the list is (1,3), but snake positions are head first, so tail is last: (1,3)? Wait, positions are [(6,5), (6,4), ..., (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]? Wait, counting: 12 segments. Head is (6,5), next is (6,4), ..., tail is (1,3). So tail is at (1,3).\n- Adjacent to tail: positions next to (1,3) are (0,3), (2,3), (1,2), (1,4). Head is at (6,5), not adjacent to (1,3).\n- Tail cell is (1,3), no food there.\nSo no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Other Considerations\n\nThe other food at (2,6) is far away with value 9, but life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. We can't reach it in one move from (6,5), so it's irrelevant for the immediate decision.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up to (6,6) to eat the positive food there safely.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

This means:\n     - It's positive food (+1 score, +1 length).\n     - It will disappear after this turn if not eaten (since life span decreases to 0 next turn).\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better understand, let's visualize the snake's position relative to the food and walls.\n\n- **Head at (6, 6)**: This is near the top-right corner (since y increases upwards).\n- **Food at (2, 6)**: This is on the same y-level as the head but to the left (x=2 vs. x=6).\n- **Snake's Body**: The body winds from (6,6) down to (6,5), (6,4), then left to (5,4), down to (5,3), left to (4,3), and so on, ending at (1,3).\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position\n\nGiven the snake's current direction is \"U\", the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (6, 7)\n   - But y=7 is a border wall, so this would cause a wall collision → **Invalid**.\n2. **Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (5, 6)\n   - Check if (5,6) is occupied by the snake's body or is a wall.\n   - Snake body positions: Looking at the list, (5,6) is not in the body.\n   - Walls: (5,6) is not a wall (only x=0,7 or y=0,7 are walls, and internal obstacle is at (3,1)).\n   - So, (5,6) is free → **Valid**.\n3. **Right (R)**: (x+1, y) → (7, 6)\n   - x=7 is a border wall → **Invalid**.\n4. **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (6, 5)\n   - But this is the opposite of current direction \"U\", and the rule states \"No instant reverse\" → **Invalid**.\n\nSo, the only valid move is **Left (L)** to (5, 6).\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving left allows us to eat the food at (2,6):\n\n- Moving left takes us to (5,6), not directly to the food at (2,6).\n- The food is at (2,6), which is four cells to the left of the head (from (6,6) to (2,6) is x decreasing by 4).\n- We cannot reach the food in one move, so we cannot eat it this turn.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nEven though we can't eat the food this turn, let's think about the food's lifespan:\n\n- Current life span: 1\n- After this turn, it will be 0, so the food will disappear.\n- Therefore, we cannot eat this food at all; it's effectively out of reach.\n\n### Alternative Considerations\n\nSince the food is not reachable, our primary goal is to avoid collisions and stay alive while positioning ourselves for potential future food.\n\nMoving left to (5,6):\n\n- Next possible moves from (5,6):\n  - Current direction would be \"L\" (since we moved left).\n  - Possible next moves: Left (to (4,6)), Up (to (5,7)), Down (to (5,5)).\n    - (5,7): y=7 is wall → invalid.\n    - (4,6): Need to check if it's free.\n      - Snake body: (4,3) is part of the body, but (4,6) is not.\n      - Not a wall → valid.\n    - (5,5): Check if free.\n      - Snake body: (6,5) is part, but (5,5) is not.\n      - Not a wall → valid.\n- This seems safe for future moves.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs moving left to (5,6) safe?\n\n- (5,6) is not part of the snake's body (check the list: no (5,6)).\n- Not a wall.\n- No negative food or other hazards mentioned.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule mentions \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\n- Our tail is at (1,3).\n- Head is at (6,6), which is not adjacent to (1,3) (distance is |6-1| + |6-3| = 5 + 3 = 8, which is more than 1).\n- So, no danger from this rule.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the current state:\n\n- Only valid move is Left (L) to (5,6).\n- Cannot eat the food this turn (it's too far and will disappear next turn).\n- Moving left is safe with no immediate collisions.\n- Future moves from (5,6) seem open.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move **Left (L)**.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 37  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacle: (3,1)\n\n**Snake Positions**:  \nHead at (5,6), followed by:  \n(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)  \nSo the tail is at (1,2).\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: L (Left)  \nThis means the snake was moving left in the previous turn, so it came from (6,6) to (5,6).\n\n**Food**:\n1. (2,6): value=7, life_span=1\n2. (1,2): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,6), possible moves are:\n- Up (U): (5,7) → y=7 is a border wall → invalid (would collide with wall)\n- Down (D): (5,5)\n- Left (L): (4,6)\n- Right (R): (6,6) → but the snake's body is at (6,6) (next segment after head) → would collide with body → invalid\n\nAlso, we cannot make an instant reverse. Current direction is L (left), so reverse would be R (right). But R is already invalid due to body collision, so this doesn't restrict us further.\n\nSo valid moves: D or L.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\n**Option 1: Down (D) to (5,5)**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (5,5) is not a wall.\n  - Body: Is (5,5) in the snake's body?\n    - Snake body positions: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)\n    - (5,5) is not in this list → safe.\n- Food at (5,5)? No food listed there.\n- So this is a safe move with no immediate reward.\n\n**Option 2: Left (L) to (4,6)**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (4,6) is not a wall.\n  - Body: Is (4,6) in the snake's body? No.\n- Food at (4,6)? No food listed there.\n- Also safe with no immediate reward.\n\nBoth D and L seem safe with no immediate reward. Now let's see if one is better than the other in terms of future possibilities or risks.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nThere are two foods:\n1. (2,6): value=7, life_span=1\n   - Current turn is 37, life_span=1 → disappears after turn 37 (i.e., next turn it's gone).\n   - Distance from head (5,6) to (2,6):\n     - Delta x: 5-2=3, delta y: 6-6=0 → distance is 3 (Manhattan distance).\n     - Can't reach it in one move.\n2. (1,2): value=10, life_span=1\n   - Also disappears after turn 37.\n   - Distance from (5,6) to (1,2):\n     - Delta x: 5-1=4, delta y: 6-2=4 → distance is 8.\n     - Can't reach it in one move.\n\nSo neither food can be eaten this turn, and both will disappear next turn. Thus, food doesn't influence this turn's decision.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the tail has positive food that's adjacent to the head, which could be dangerous if eaten next turn.\n- Tail is at (1,2).\n- Head is at (5,6).\n- Distance: |5-1| + |6-2| = 4 + 4 = 8 → not adjacent (adjacent means distance 1).\nSo no immediate danger from tail food.\n\n### Future Path Considerations\n\nSince both moves are safe and no food is reachable this turn, we can choose either. But let's see which might set up better future moves.\n\n**If we go Down (D) to (5,5):**\n- Next head position: (5,5)\n- Possible next moves from there:\n  - From (5,5), direction is D (since we moved D).\n  - Possible moves: L (left to (4,5)), R (right to (6,5)), D (down to (5,4))\n    - U is reverse of D, so invalid.\n  - Check body:\n    - Current body after move: (5,6) is new head, old head (5,6) is now body, followed by rest.\n    - Wait, no: snake moves by adding new head and removing tail unless eating.\n    - After move D to (5,5):\n      - New head: (5,5)\n      - Body: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), ..., (1,2)\n      - Tail (1,1) is removed (since length doesn't increase, no food eaten).\n    - So possible next moves:\n      - L to (4,5): check if (4,5) is in body: no.\n      - R to (6,5): (6,5) is in body → invalid.\n      - D to (5,4): (5,4) is in body → invalid.\n    - So only L is possible next turn if we go D now.\n\nThis seems limiting—next turn only L is possible.\n\n**If we go Left (L) to (4,6):**\n- Next head position: (4,6)\n- Direction is L.\n- Possible next moves:\n  - From (4,6), direction L, so cannot go R (reverse).\n  - Possible: U (up to (4,7)), D (down to (4,5)), L (left to (3,6))\n    - U: (4,7) is y=7 → wall → invalid.\n    - D: (4,5)\n      - Is (4,5) in body? Current body after move: (5,6), (6,6), ..., (1,2)\n      - (4,5) is not in body → valid.\n    - L: (3,6)\n      - Is (3,6) in body? No.\n      - Also, is (3,6) a wall? No walls at (3,6).\n      - Valid.\n  - So next turn could choose D or L.\n\nThis seems better—next turn we have two options (D or L) instead of just one if we go D now.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Benefits\n\nIs there any immediate benefit to one move over the other?\n- No food to eat this turn.\n- No immediate danger in either.\n- Left seems to offer more flexibility next turn.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\nIs there any risk in choosing Left?\n- Moving to (4,6):\n  - Next to (3,6), which is not a wall or body.\n  - No immediate threats.\n  \nDown to (5,5):\n- Next turn only left to (4,5), which is safe but limits options more.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that Left offers more flexibility for the next move without any immediate downsides, it seems the better choice.\n\n### Verifying Tail Position After Move\n\nJust to be thorough, let's see where the tail is after moving Left:\n- Current tail: (1,2)\n- After moving Left to (4,6):\n  - New head: (4,6)\n  - Body: (5,6), (6,6), ..., (1,2)\n  - Tail was (1,2), now removed, new tail is (1,1) (but looking at snake positions, the segment before (1,2) is (1,1), so tail moves to (1,1), but (1,1) is already in the body as second last segment—wait, no:\nOriginal snake: [(5,6), (6,6), ..., (1,1), (1,2)]\nAfter move Left:\n- Add new head (4,6), remove tail (1,2)\n- New snake: [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), ..., (1,1)]\nSo tail is now at (1,1), which was previously part of the body, but now is the end.\n\nNo immediate collision risks here.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating both options, moving **Left (L)** to (4,6) is the better choice as it maintains more flexibility for future moves without any immediate risks.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's visualize the current state of the game based on the provided information.\n\n#### Grid Dimensions:\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (meaning the snake cannot move to these coordinates).\n\n#### Internal Obstacles:\n- There's one internal obstacle at (3, 1).\n\n#### Snake:\n- **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head to the tail.\n  - Head: (4, 6)\n  - Body: [(5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (1, 1)]\n- **Current Direction**: The snake is currently moving to the Left (L).\n\n#### Food:\n1. **First Food**: (2, 6)\n   - Value: +1 (positive food)\n   - Life Span: 6 turns\n2. **Second Food**: (1, 2)\n   - Value: +1 (positive food)\n   - Life Span: 9 turns\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to sketch a rough representation of the grid at y=6 to y=0, x=0 to x=7:\n\n- y=6: ... | (4,6)H | (5,6)B | (6,6)B | ...\n- y=5: ... | (6,5)B | ...\n- y=4: ... | (6,4)B | (5,4)B | ...\n- y=3: ... | (5,3)B | (4,3)B | (3,3)B | (2,3)B | ...\n- y=2: ... | (2,2)B | (1,2)F | ...\n- y=1: ... | (2,1)B | (1,1)B | (3,1)X | ...\n- y=0: Wall\n\n(Where H is head, B is body, F is food, X is obstacle)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Left (L). The possible moves are:\n- **Left (L)**: Continue left to (3, 6)\n- **Up (U)**: From (4,6) to (4,7) — but y=7 is a wall, so invalid.\n- **Down (D)**: From (4,6) to (4,5)\n- **Right (R)**: Opposite of current direction (L), so invalid (cannot reverse instantly).\n\nSo, valid moves are L and D.\n\n#### Checking Move Left (L) to (3, 6):\n- Is (3,6) occupied by body? Let's check snake positions: No.\n- Is (3,6) a wall? No.\n- Is (3,6) an obstacle? The obstacle is at (3,1), so no.\n- So, moving left is safe in terms of collision.\n\n#### Checking Move Down (D) to (4,5):\n- Is (4,5) occupied by body? Checking snake positions: No.\n- Is (4,5) a wall or obstacle? No.\n- So, moving down is also safe.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if either move can lead to eating food.\n\n#### Food at (2,6):\n- Current head is at (4,6). To reach (2,6), the path is left twice.\n- If we move left to (3,6), next turn we could move left to (2,6) to eat the food.\n- But we need to ensure that eating this food won't cause a collision with the new tail.\n  - Current tail is at (1,1). After eating, the tail would be at (2,1) (since the snake grows by 1).\n  - The new head would be at (2,6), new tail at (2,1). No collision.\n- However, the food's life span is 6 turns. It will disappear after 6 more turns (including this one), so we have time.\n\n#### Food at (1,2):\n- Current head is at (4,6). To reach (1,2), it's multiple moves away.\n- Life span is 9 turns, so it's not urgent.\n\n### Potential Dangers\n\nWe need to ensure that moving left or down doesn't lead to a dead end or immediate danger next turn.\n\n#### After Moving Left to (3,6):\n- Next turn, possible moves from (3,6):\n  - Left to (2,6) to eat food.\n  - Down to (3,5) — need to check if this is safe.\n    - (3,5) is not in current body positions, not a wall or obstacle.\n  - Up to (3,7) — wall, invalid.\n- So, moving left seems safe and keeps options open.\n\n#### After Moving Down to (4,5):\n- Next turn, possible moves from (4,5):\n  - Left to (3,5)\n  - Right to (5,5)\n  - Down to (4,4)\n  - Up to (4,6) — but (4,6) is the previous head position, now body at (5,6), so (4,6) is empty.\n- This also seems safe but doesn't immediately lead to food.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe need to check if moving to a food cell would cause the head to collide with the newly grown tail.\n- For food at (2,6):\n  - If we move to (2,6) next turn, the tail grows from (1,1) to (2,1).\n  - New head at (2,6), new tail at (2,1). They are not adjacent (distance is |6-1|=5 > 1), so safe.\n- For food at (1,2):\n  - Not immediately relevant.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween moving left and down:\n- Moving left keeps the option to eat the food at (2,6) next turn.\n- Moving down is safe but doesn't lead directly to food.\n\nGiven that both moves are safe, but moving left aligns with reaching the positive food soon, it seems better.\n\nHowever, let's think one more step ahead:\n- If we move left to (3,6), next turn we can move left to (2,6) to eat the food.\n  - Then, from (2,6), possible moves:\n    - Left to (1,6) — but x=0 is a wall, so only if (1,6) is safe.\n    - Down to (2,5)\n    - Up to (2,7) — wall, invalid.\n    - Right to (3,6) — but (3,6) is where the body was (since head was at (4,6), then (3,6), then (2,6), so body is at (3,6), (4,6), etc. Wait, no:\n      - After moving to (3,6), body is [(5,6), (6,6), ...], head at (3,6), so (4,6) is now body.\n      - Then move to (2,6), body is [(3,6), (4,6), ...], head at (2,6).\n      - Then moving right to (3,6) would collide with body at (3,6). So right is invalid.\n    - So from (2,6), possible moves are left to (1,6) or down to (2,5).\n      - (1,6): not in body, not wall or obstacle.\n      - (2,5): not in body, not wall or obstacle.\n    - So after eating, we have options to go left or down.\n\nThis seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (4,5) is safe but doesn't lead directly to food. It might be a more conservative move, but since moving left is safe and leads towards food, it seems better.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Under Head\n\nIs there food under the snake's body that could be eaten?\n- The head is at (4,6). Is (4,6) a food position? No, foods are at (2,6) and (1,2).\n- So no immediate food to eat this turn.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven that moving left is safe and aligns with reaching the positive food at (2,6) next turn, and moving down is safe but doesn't lead directly to food, the better immediate action is to move left.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 39\n\n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and touching any of these borders is a wall collision).\n- Internal obstacle: (3,1) — can't move here.\n\n**Snake Positions**:\nHead is at (3,6), followed by body segments in order:\n- (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1)\n\nSo, the snake is quite long, with the tail at (2,1).\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Left (L). This means the last move was to the left (from (4,6) to (3,6)).\n\n**Food**:\n1. (2,6): value = +1, life_span = 5\n2. (1,2): value = +1, life_span = 8\n\nBoth foods are positive, so eating either is good, but we need to consider safety.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3,6), moving Left (L) would go to (2,6), Up (U) to (3,7), Down (D) to (3,5), and Right (R) to (4,6).\n\nBut we can't reverse direction instantly. Current direction is L, so we can't move Right (R) next (since Right is opposite of Left).\n\nSo possible moves: L, U, D.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Left (L) to (2,6)**:\n   - (2,6) is a food position with value +1.\n   - Check if eating this is safe:\n     - After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the new tail is the old tail (2,1), but since we're adding a segment, the tail doesn't move, so the new body is:\n       - New head: (2,6)\n       - Body: (3,6), (4,6), ..., (2,1)\n     - Now, check if the head is adjacent to the new tail (which is still (2,1)): (2,6) and (2,1) are not adjacent (they're 5 apart vertically), so no immediate collision.\n     - Also, (2,6) is not part of the current body (check snake positions: no (2,6)), so no body collision.\n     - Not a wall: x=2, y=6 is within borders (x=0-7, y=0-7), and not an internal obstacle.\n   - So moving Left to eat the food at (2,6) seems safe and beneficial.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (3,7)**:\n   - (3,7): y=7 is a border wall, so this is a wall collision — deadly. Can't do this.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (3,5)**:\n   - (3,5): Check if it's safe:\n     - Not a food position.\n     - Not part of the current body (check snake positions: no (3,5)).\n     - Not a wall: within borders, not an internal obstacle.\n   - Moving Down is safe but doesn't get us food. It's a neutral move.\n\n### Comparing Options\n\n- Left (L): Eat +1 food, safe.\n- Down (D): No food, safe but no gain.\n- Up (U): Deadly.\n\nSo, Left is the best immediate action here.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nOne special case is \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Current tail is at (2,1).\n- Adjacent to tail: (1,1), (3,1), (2,0), (2,2).\n- Head is at (3,6), which is not adjacent to (2,1), so no danger here even if we eat food near the tail, which we're not in this case.\n\n### Verifying Food Life Span\n\nFood at (2,6): life_span = 5, so it will disappear after 5 more turns (including current turn if we don't eat it now). It's still available this turn.\n\nFood at (1,2): life_span = 8, so it's not disappearing soon.\n\n### Is There a Better Plan?\n\nThe other food is at (1,2), which is far from the current head (3,6). To reach it, we'd need multiple moves, and it's not immediately accessible. The immediate choice is between eating (2,6) or moving Down to (3,5) to maybe set up for future moves, but eating now seems better.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Left to (2,6) to eat the positive food there, which is safe and increases the score.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

However:\n- **No instant reverse**: Since the snake is moving Left (\"L\"), it cannot move Right (\"R\") in the next turn.\n  \nSo, possible immediate moves are: U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L):\n- Current head: (2, 6)\n- New head position: (2 - 1, 6) = (1, 6)\n  \nCheck for collisions:\n- **Wall**: x=0 is a wall, but (1,6) is not a wall.\n- **Body**: Check if (1,6) is in the snake's body. The body segments are from (3,6) onwards, so (1,6) is not in the body.\n  \nFood:\n- Is there food at (1,6)? No, the foods are at (1,2) and (3,2).\n  \nOutcome:\n- Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U):\n- Current head: (2, 6)\n- New head position: (2, 6 + 1) = (2, 7)\n  \nCheck for collisions:\n- **Wall**: y=7 is a wall, so (2,7) is a wall → collision.\n  \nOutcome:\n- Deadly move (wall collision).\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D):\n- Current head: (2, 6)\n- New head position: (2, 6 - 1) = (2, 5)\n  \nCheck for collisions:\n- **Wall**: y=0 is at the bottom, (2,5) is not a wall.\n- **Body**: Is (2,5) in the body? Checking the body segments: no (2,5) is not listed.\n  \nFood:\n- Is there food at (2,5)? No.\n  \nOutcome:\n- Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's consider the food positions and their values to see if we can aim for them in future moves.\n\nFoods:\n1. (1, 2): value=7, life=1\n   - Life span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n2. (3, 2): value=10, life=1\n   - Similarly, will disappear after this turn.\n\nGiven that both foods have a life span of 1, they will disappear after the current turn unless eaten now.\n\nCan we reach either food this turn?\n\nCurrent head: (2,6)\n- Distance to (1,2): Manhattan distance = |2-1| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- Distance to (3,2): |2-3| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nBoth foods are 5 moves away, so we cannot reach them in a single move. Therefore, we cannot eat either food this turn, and they will disappear after this turn regardless of our move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrent tail position: (2,1)\nIs the head adjacent to the tail?\n- Head: (2,6), Tail: (2,1)\n- Adjacent means distance of 1: |2-2| + |6-1| = 5, not adjacent.\n\nSo, this rule doesn't apply here.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nFrom the possible safe moves (L and D), neither allows eating food this turn, and both foods will disappear after this turn. So, the choice is between moving Left or Down.\n\n**Moving Left (L)**:\n- New head: (1,6)\n- Next possible moves from (1,6): \n  - Current direction would be L, so can't move R.\n  - Can move U, D, or continue L.\n  \n**Moving Down (D)**:\n- New head: (2,5)\n- Next possible moves from (2,5):\n  - Current direction would be D, so can't move U.\n  - Can move L, R, or continue D.\n\nLooking ahead, moving Down might be slightly better because:\n- Moving Left takes us closer to the left wall (x=0), limiting future options.\n- Moving Down keeps us more central, allowing more flexibility in future moves.\n\nHowever, both moves are safe and don't lead to immediate advantages or disadvantages since the foods are disappearing. \n\nGiven that, moving Left is also safe and doesn't immediately limit options more than moving Down.\n\nBut let's think about the snake's body:\n- The snake's body is long and currently occupies many positions.\n- Moving Down to (2,5) is not adjacent to any body segments.\n- Moving Left to (1,6) is also not adjacent to any body segments that would cause immediate collision next turn.\n\nGiven that both are equally safe, and no immediate food is available, either move is acceptable. However, moving Down might be slightly better as it keeps the snake more central, avoiding the left wall.\n\nBut looking at the snake's current path, it's moving left along the top. Moving Down could be a way to start turning the snake around to avoid getting stuck in the top-left corner.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, moving Down seems slightly more advantageous to maintain flexibility in future moves.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's visualize the current state of the game to better understand the snake's position, the walls, and the food locations.\n\n#### Snake Positions:\nThe snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head to the tail. Here's the breakdown:\n- Head: (2, 5)\n- Body segments: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)\n\n#### Snake Head Direction:\nThe current direction of the snake's head is \"D\" (Down). This means that in the previous move, the snake moved downward. \n\n#### Movement Constraints:\n- **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is Down (\"D\"), the snake cannot move Up (\"U\") in the next move because that would be the opposite direction.\n  \n#### Walls:\n- **Border Cells**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)), and the borders are walls.\n- **Internal Obstacles**: [(3,1)] — there's a wall at (3,1).\n\n#### Food:\nThere are two pieces of food:\n1. (1, 2): Value = 6, Life Span = 1\n   - This is positive food (+1 score, length +1).\n   - It will disappear after this turn (life span decreases to 0 next turn).\n2. (3, 2): Value = 9, Life Span = 1\n   - This is also positive food.\n   - It will also disappear after this turn.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (2,5) with Direction \"D\":\nGiven the current direction is Down, the possible moves are:\n- Down (D): (2,4)\n- Left (L): (1,5)\n- Right (R): (3,5)\n\nCannot move Up (U) because it's the opposite of the current direction.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move for safety (no collisions) and potential rewards.\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D) to (2,4):\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body: The snake's body segments are at (2,6), (3,6), ..., (2,2). (2,4) is not in the body list → safe.\n  - Walls: (2,4) is not a border wall (x=0/7, y=0/7) and not an internal obstacle (only (3,1) is an obstacle) → safe.\n- Food: No food at (2,4).\n- Outcome: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (1,5):\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body: (1,5) is not in the body list → safe.\n  - Walls: (1,5) is not a border or internal wall → safe.\n- Food: No food at (1,5).\n- Outcome: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (3,5):\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body: (3,5) is not in the body list → safe.\n  - Walls: (3,5) is not a border or internal wall → safe.\n- Food: No food at (3,5).\n- Outcome: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Considering Food Positions:\nBoth food items are positive and will disappear after this turn, so it's beneficial to try to eat them if possible.\n\n#### Food at (1,2):\n- Current head is at (2,5). To reach (1,2):\n  - Need to move left to (1,5), then down to (1,4), then down to (1,3), then down to (1,2).\n  - This would take 3 moves, but the food disappears after this turn → cannot reach in time.\n\n#### Food at (3,2):\n- Current head is at (2,5). To reach (3,2):\n  - Move right to (3,5), then down to (3,4), then down to (3,3), then down to (3,2).\n    - However, the snake's body is at (3,3) and (3,6). Moving to (3,3) would collide with the body → unsafe.\n  - Alternative path: move down to (2,4), left to (1,4), down to (1,3), right to (2,3), right to (3,3), down to (3,2).\n    - Too many steps, food disappears after this turn → cannot reach in time.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger:\nWe need to check if the head is adjacent to the tail and if the tail cell has positive food.\n- Tail is at (2,2).\n- Adjacent cells to tail (2,2):\n  - Up: (2,3) — part of the body (not tail)\n  - Down: (2,1) — not occupied by snake\n  - Left: (1,2) — has food (value=6)\n  - Right: (3,2) — has food (value=9)\n  \nThe head is at (2,5), which is not adjacent to the tail (distance is 3 in y-direction). So, no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Evaluating Immediate Moves:\nSince we cannot reach any food this turn, the priority is to move safely without colliding and position ourselves for future opportunities.\n\nPossible safe moves:\n- Down to (2,4)\n- Left to (1,5)\n- Right to (3,5)\n\nAll three are safe. Now, let's see which move might set us up better for future food collection.\n\n#### Future Considerations:\nAfter this turn, both foods disappear, and new foods may spawn. We want to position the snake in a way that maximizes future opportunities.\n\n- Moving Down (D) to (2,4):\n  - Next possible moves from (2,4): U (but opposite of current D), L, R.\n  - Moves us away from the current food locations, but no immediate benefit.\n\n- Moving Left (L) to (1,5):\n  - Next possible moves from (1,5): D, L, R (cannot move U opposite of D).\n  - Moves us towards the left side, which is near where the food at (1,2) was, but that's disappearing.\n\n- Moving Right (R) to (3,5):\n  - Next possible moves from (3,5): D, L, R.\n  - Moves us towards the center, which might be better for accessing future foods.\n\nGiven that moving right seems to position the snake more centrally, which is generally better for accessing potential future food spawns, this seems like the best option among the safe moves.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Food Access:\nJust to confirm, is there any way to eat the food at (3,2) this turn?\n- Current head at (2,5), food at (3,2).\n- To eat it this turn, the head would have to be at (3,2) after moving, which is impossible in one move from (2,5).\n  \nSimilarly for (1,2):\n- Head at (2,5), food at (1,2) — cannot reach in one move.\n\n### Final Decision:\nAll immediate moves are safe, but none allow eating food this turn. Moving Right (R) to (3,5) seems the most strategic as it positions the snake more centrally for future moves.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand where everything is positioned and what constraints we have.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n2. **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal obstacle at (3,1).\n3. **Snake Positions**: The snake's head is at (3,5), and its body segments follow in order:\n   - Head: (3,5)\n   - Body: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)\n   - Tail: (2,3)\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: The head is currently moving to the Right (R).\n5. **Food Items**:\n   - (1,2): value = 5, life_span = 1\n   - (3,2): value = 8, life_span = 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better visualize, let's sketch a rough map (only relevant parts):\n\n- Snake head at (3,5), moving right (R).\n- The body wraps around; the tail is at (2,3).\n- Food at (1,2) and (3,2).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3,5) moving right (R), the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Right (R)**: (4,5)\n   - Check if (4,5) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=4 is within 1-6, y=5 is within 1-6.\n     - Not part of the snake's body except possibly the tail.\n     - Current body segments: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)\n     - (4,5) is not in the body segments list, so it's safe.\n   \n2. **Up (U)**: (3,6)\n   - (3,6) is part of the body (third segment after head), so this would be a collision. Invalid.\n   \n3. **Down (D)**: (3,4)\n   - Check (3,4):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not in body segments: safe.\n   \n4. **Left (L)**: (2,5)\n   - (2,5) is the first body segment after the head. Moving left would make the head collide with the body immediately. Invalid.\n   - Also, current direction is R, so L is the opposite direction, which is not allowed (\"No instant reverse\").\n\nSo, valid immediate moves are R to (4,5) or D to (3,4).\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if either move can lead to eating food.\n\n1. **Food at (1,2)**:\n   - Far from current head position (3,5). Not reachable in one move.\n   \n2. **Food at (3,2)**:\n   - Current head at (3,5). To reach (3,2), need to move down three times.\n   - Next move D to (3,4), then D to (3,3), then D to (3,2).\n   - But food's life_span is 1, meaning it disappears after this turn (including current turn), so it will be gone by next turn. Cannot reach it in time.\n\nTherefore, no food can be eaten in the immediate next move.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if any food is adjacent to the tail that could cause tail reward danger:\n\n- Tail is at (2,3).\n- Adjacent to tail: (1,3), (3,3), (2,2), (2,4).\n- Food at (1,2) and (3,2):\n  - (1,2) is adjacent to (1,3) and (2,2).\n  - (3,2) is adjacent to (3,3) and (2,2).\n- So, (1,2) is adjacent to tail's adjacent cells but not directly adjacent to tail.\n- (3,2) is adjacent to (3,3), which is part of the snake's body (second last segment before tail).\n  \nBut tail reward danger is when:\n- Head is adjacent to tail, and\n- Tail cell has positive food.\n\nCurrently, head is at (3,5), tail at (2,3). They are not adjacent (distance is sqrt((3-2)^2 + (5-3)^2 = sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5) > 1). So no immediate danger.\n\n### Choosing Between R and D\n\nBoth R to (4,5) and D to (3,4) are safe. Which is better?\n\n- **Moving R to (4,5)**:\n  - Current direction is R, so continuing in the same direction is allowed.\n  - Next possible moves from (4,5):\n    - R to (5,5): check (5,5) is safe (not in body: (5,6), (5,4), (5,3) are in body, but (5,5) is not).\n    - U to (4,6): (4,6) is in body.\n    - D to (4,4): safe.\n  \n- **Moving D to (3,4)**:\n  - Changes direction to D.\n  - Next possible moves from (3,4):\n    - D to (3,3): (3,3) is in body.\n    - L to (2,4): safe.\n    - R to (4,4): safe.\n\nBoth moves seem safe, but moving R continues the current direction, which might be preferable unless there's a strategic reason to turn.\n\n### Checking Future Moves for Food\n\nFood at (1,2) and (3,2) will disappear next turn, so no immediate benefit. Next food spawns are unknown. \n\nLooking at the snake's body, it's quite long (length 14), so space is limited. Moving R to (4,5) seems to open up more space towards the right side of the grid where there's less body congestion compared to moving down where the body is more densely packed.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- Moving D to (3,4) brings the head closer to the body segments below, potentially limiting future moves.\n- Moving R to (4,5) moves away from the denser body areas.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that:\n- Both R and D are safe immediate moves.\n- No food is immediately accessible.\n- Moving R seems to provide more open space for future moves.\n- Continuing in the current direction (R) is generally safer unless there's a reason to turn.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to continue moving Right.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Adjacent cells to head (4,5) are:\n        - (3,5), (5,5), (4,4), (4,6).\n      - Tail is at (3,3), which is not adjacent to head (distance is more than 1), so no danger.\n    - So eating is safe and beneficial.\n- After moving right:\n  - New head at (5,5), eating food, so new tail stays where it was (tail doesn't move when growing).\n  - New body: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), ... (3,3)].\n\nThis seems like a good move.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (4,6)\n- Check (4,6):\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Is it part of the body?\n    - Current body has (4,6) as the 6th segment.\n    - So moving here would collide with the body — deadly.\n  - So this move is invalid (would kill the snake).\n\n#### 3.

No food listed at (4,4).\n  - So this is a safe move but doesn't gain any points.\n  - Not as good as moving right to eat the +10 food.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n- Right (R): eat +10 food, safe.\n- Up (U): deadly.\n- Down (D): safe but no gain.\n\nBest move is clearly Right to (5,5) to eat the +10 food.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers After Eating\nAfter moving to (5,5) and eating:\n- New head at (5,5), body grows by 1, so tail stays at (3,3).\n- Next turn, the head is at (5,5), direction is R.\n  - Possible moves: R (6,5), U (5,6), D (5,4).\n    - (6,5): currently part of body (8th segment), but since tail is at (3,3), after moving, the tail moves forward, so (6,5) might not be part of body anymore — need to check.\n      - Original body before move: [(4,5), (3,5), ..., (6,5), ..., (3,3)].\n      - After move and growth: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), ..., (6,5), ..., (3,3)].\n      - So (6,5) is still in the body — so moving R to (6,5) next turn would be deadly.\n    - (5,6): currently part of body (6th segment).\n      - After move: [(5,5), (4,5), ..., (5,6), ...], so still in body — deadly.\n    - (5,4): currently part of body (10th segment).\n      - After move: [(5,5), (4,5), ..., (5,4), ...], still in body — deadly.\n  - So after eating at (5,5), next turn all moves are deadly — meaning the snake will die next turn.\n  \nThis is a problem! Eating the +10 food leads to certain death next turn. Therefore, it's not a safe move in the long run.\n\n### Re-evaluating Moves Considering Future Steps\nGiven that moving Right leads to certain death next turn, let's consider the Down move even though it doesn't gain points immediately.\n\n#### Move Down (D) to (4,4)\n- New head at (4,4), body moves forward, tail at (2,5) (original tail was (3,3), but since we didn't eat, the tail moves from (3,3) to (next segment)).\nWait, let's see how the body moves when not eating:\nOriginal body: [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)].\nMove head to (4,4), so new body: [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)].\nTail was (3,3), now it's removed, new tail is (4,3).\n\nNow, next turn head is at (4,4), direction is D (since we moved down from R, which is allowed).\nPossible moves:\n- Down (D): (4,3) — tail is at (4,3), but since tail moves after, this is safe (head moves to where tail was, tail moves away).\n- Left (L): (3,4) — check if valid.\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not in body: [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)] — no (3,4), so safe.\n- Right (R): (5,4) — in body (10th segment), deadly.\n  \nSo next turn after D, can go D or L.\n\nThis seems safer than moving Right which leads to certain death.\n\n### Conclusion\nEven though moving Right to (5,5) gives a high-value food, it leads to certain death next turn. Moving Down doesn't gain points immediately but keeps the snake alive with possible future moves.\n\nTherefore, the safest immediate action is to move Down.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the scenario:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   \n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. So, the snake cannot move outside these boundaries.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (3, 1). This means the snake cannot move into this cell.\n\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head to the tail. The head is at (4, 4), followed by (4, 5), ..., down to the tail at (4, 3).\n   - **Direction**: The snake's head is currently moving **Down (D)**, which corresponds to (x, y-1). So, the previous move was from (4, 5) to (4, 4).\n\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are three pieces of food:\n     1. (1, 2): value = 3, life_span = 1\n     2. (3, 2): value = 6, life_span = 1\n     3. (5, 5): value = 9, life_span = 1\n   - All foods have a positive value (+1 each) and will disappear after the current turn (since life_span is 1 and it decreases this turn).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Down (D), the snake cannot move Up (U) next, as that would be the reverse direction.\n   \n   So, possible moves are: D, L, R.\n\n2. **Wall and Body Collisions**:\n   - **Down (D)**: (4, 4) → (4, 3)\n     - Check (4, 3): This is the tail of the snake. Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move forward, but we need to check if the tail has food that could cause a collision after growth.\n     - The tail is at (4, 3), and there's no food listed at (4, 3), so it's safe.\n   - **Left (L)**: (4, 4) → (3, 4)\n     - Check (3, 4): \n       - Walls: Not a wall (internal obstacle is at (3,1)).\n       - Body: Look through snake positions. The snake's body is at [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)]. (3,4) is not in this list, so it's safe.\n   - **Right (R)**: (4, 4) → (5, 4)\n     - Check (5, 4):\n       - Walls: Not a wall.\n       - Body: (5,4) is part of the snake's body (second last segment). Moving here would cause the head to collide with the body, which is deadly.\n\nSo, from the above, possible safe moves are D and L. R leads to a body collision.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving D or L can lead to eating food:\n\n1. **Down (D)**: (4,4) → (4,3)\n   - Food at (4,3)? No food is listed there. So, no food eaten.\n   \n2. **Left (L)**: (4,4) → (3,4)\n   - Food at (3,4)? No food is listed there. So, no food eaten.\n\nNeither immediate move leads to eating food. However, we should consider future moves to maximize score.\n\n### Future Moves Consideration\n\nSince none of the immediate moves lead to food, we should choose a move that keeps options open for future food collection.\n\n- **Down (D)**:\n  - New head at (4,3). \n  - Possible next moves from (4,3), direction D:\n    - Can't go U (reverse), so D, L, R.\n    - D: (4,2) - Check borders: y=2 is not a wall. No body there (current body is moving away).\n    - L: (3,3) - Not a wall, not in body (after tail moves).\n    - R: (5,3) - Not a wall, but (5,3) is in the body (tail is at (4,3), next is (5,3)? Wait, current body is ..., (5,3), (4,3). So after moving D, tail moves from (4,3) to ?, but (5,3) is before (4,3) in body, so it's not directly ahead. Maybe safe.\n  \n- **Left (L)**:\n  - New head at (3,4).\n  - Possible next moves from (3,4), direction L:\n    - Can't go R (reverse), so U, D, L.\n    - U: (3,5) - Body is at (3,5) currently, but it will move away unless the head is there. Need to see if it's safe after movement.\n    - D: (3,3) - Not wall, not in body.\n    - L: (2,4) - Not wall, not in body.\n\nBetween D and L, both seem safe, but let's see if one leads closer to food.\n\n### Proximity to Food\n\nCurrent food positions:\n1. (1,2) - value 3\n2. (3,2) - value 6\n3. (5,5) - value 9\n\nFrom head at (4,4):\n\n- Distance to (1,2): |4-1| + |4-2| = 3 + 2 = 5\n- Distance to (3,2): |4-3| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- Distance to (5,5): |4-5| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nClosest is (5,5), then (3,2), then (1,2).\n\nBut (5,5) is at distance 2. Can we reach it?\n\nCurrent move options:\n- D to (4,3):\n  - Then next move could be L to (3,3), then U to (3,4), but (5,5) is still far.\n- L to (3,4):\n  - Then next move could be U to (3,5), but (3,5) is body. Or D to (3,3), then L to (2,3), etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe aim for (3,2):\n\nFrom (4,4), L to (3,4), then D to (3,3), then D to (3,2) - eats food (3,2).\n\nBut food disappears after this turn, so we can't reach it next turn.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5): from (4,4), R is not safe, so can't go directly. Maybe D to (4,3), then R to (5,3), then U to (5,4), then U to (5,5). But food disappears this turn.\n\nThus, none of the food can be eaten this turn or next turn before disappearing.\n\n### Avoiding Dead Ends\n\nSince we can't eat food this turn, we should choose a move that doesn't trap the snake.\n\nLooking at the snake's body, it's quite long (length 14). Moving D to (4,3) seems safe, as the tail is at (4,3), but since the tail moves, it's okay.\n\nMoving L to (3,4) also seems safe, but let's see the body:\n\nCurrent body: [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)]\n\nAfter moving L to (3,4), new head is (3,4), tail moves away from (4,3) to ?\n\nNew body: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3)]\n\nThis seems to open up space.\n\nAlternatively, moving D to (4,3):\n\nNew body: [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3)]\n\nThis also seems okay\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand the positions and constraints:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: (3,1). The snake cannot move to this cell.\n3. **Snake Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head to the tail. \n   - Head: (4,3)\n   - Subsequent body segments: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3)\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving \"D\" (Down). This means the snake was moving in the negative y-direction in the previous move.\n5. **Food Items**:\n   - (1,2): value = 2, life_span = 1\n   - (3,2): value = 5, life_span = 1\n   - (5,5): value = 8, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nGiven the current direction is \"D\" (Down), the possible moves are constrained by the \"no instant reverse\" rule. This means we cannot move \"U\" (Up) next, as that would be the opposite direction. So, the possible moves are: D, L, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move from the head's current position (4,3):\n\n1. **Move Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (4,2)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=2 is not a wall (border is y=0).\n     - Body: Is (4,2) in the snake's body? Current body positions are from (4,4) to (5,3). (4,2) is not in this list.\n     - Obstacles: (3,1) is an obstacle, but (4,2) is not (3,1).\n   - Valid move.\n   - Food at (4,2)? No food is listed at (4,2).\n   - No immediate reward, but safe.\n\n2. **Move Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (3,3)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=3 is not a wall (border is x=0,7).\n     - Body: Is (3,3) in the snake's body? Checking the list: no.\n     - Obstacles: (3,1) is an obstacle, but (3,3) is not the same.\n   - Valid move.\n   - Food at (3,3)? No food listed here.\n   - No immediate reward, but safe.\n\n3. **Move Right (R)**: (x+1, y) → (5,3)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=5 is not a wall.\n     - Body: Is (5,3) in the snake's body? Yes, the tail is at (5,3).\n     - However, moving into the tail is generally allowed because the tail will move forward in the same turn, freeing up the space. But we need to check if this is the tail and if eating food there would cause a collision.\n     - Looking at the snake positions: the tail is (5,3). If we move right to (5,3), and if there's food there, eating it would make the tail stay at (5,3), causing the head to collide with the new tail (since the snake grows by 1).\n     - Is there food at (5,3)? Checking the food list: no food at (5,3).\n     - So, moving to (5,3) is safe because there's no food to eat there, and the tail will move away.\n   - Valid move.\n   - No immediate reward, but safe.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions and see if any are reachable in one move:\n\n1. (1,2): value=2, life=1\n   - Distance from head (4,3): |4-1| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 (Manhattan distance). Cannot reach in one move.\n2. (3,2): value=5, life=1\n   - Distance: |4-3| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2. Can reach in two moves (e.g., L then D or D then L).\n   - Not reachable in one move.\n3. (5,5): value=8, life=1\n   - Distance: |4-5| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3. Cannot reach in one move.\n\nNone of the food items are directly adjacent to the head, so no immediate food can be eaten in the next move.\n\n### Potential Future Moves\n\nSince no food is immediately accessible, we should consider moves that position the snake to reach high-value food soon, especially since some food has a life_span of 1 and will disappear next turn.\n\nLooking at the food:\n- (3,2): high value (5), life=1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten).\n  - To reach (3,2) from (4,3):\n    - Path 1: L to (3,3), then D to (3,2).\n    - Path 2: D to (4,2), then L to (3,2).\n  - Both require two moves, but since life_span is 1, it will disappear after the current turn, so we cannot reach it in time.\n- (5,5): value=8, life=1\n  - Similarly, cannot reach in one move, will disappear.\n- (1,2): value=2, life=1\n  - Too far, will disappear.\n\nThus, none of the current food can be eaten before they disappear. Therefore, the immediate move doesn't need to prioritize food; instead, we should avoid collisions and position the snake for future opportunities.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule states that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our current state:\n- Tail is at (5,3).\n- Adjacent cells to the head (4,3):\n  - U: (4,4) - part of the body.\n  - D: (4,2) - empty.\n  - L: (3,3) - empty.\n  - R: (5,3) - tail.\n- Is there food at the tail (5,3)? No.\n- So, no danger from tail reward in this case.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nGiven that no food is immediately accessible and all current food will disappear after this turn, the primary goal is to move safely without colliding. Let's re-examine the possible moves:\n\n1. **D (Down) to (4,2)**:\n   - Safe, no food.\n   - Next moves from (4,2):\n     - Can go L to (3,2) - but no food there now (food at (3,2) will disappear).\n     - Can go R to (5,2) - empty.\n     - Can go D to (4,1) - but y=1 is not a wall, but need to check if (4,1) is safe.\n       - (4,1) is not in body, not a wall (border is y=0), not an obstacle (obstacle is at (3,1)).\n\n2. **L (Left) to (3,3)**:\n   - Safe, no food.\n   - Next moves from (3,3):\n     - Can go D to (3,2) - no food now.\n     - Can go L to (2,3) - need to check:\n       - (2,3): not in body, not a wall, not an obstacle.\n     - Cannot go U (reverse of D).\n\n3. **R (Right) to (5,3)**:\n   - Safe, no food.\n   - Next moves from (5,3):\n     - Can go D to (5,2) - empty.\n     - Can go R to (6,3) - need to check:\n       - (6,3): not in body, not a wall (border is x=7), not an obstacle.\n     - Cannot go L (reverse of R).\n\nAll three moves are safe, but we should choose one that may lead to better future opportunities. \n\nLooking at the snake's body, it's currently in a somewhat coiled position. Moving Down to (4,2) might open up more space in the upper part of the grid, whereas moving Left or Right keeps the snake more horizontal.\n\nGiven that, moving Down seems reasonable to potentially explore the lower part of the grid where there might be new food spawns in future turns.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Threats\n\nIs there any immediate threat in moving Down to (4,2)?\n- Next possible moves from (4\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 46  \n**Grid Size**: Based on the border walls, it's an 8x8 grid (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).  \n**Internal Obstacle**: There's one at (3, 1).  \n**Snake Positions**: The snake is quite long with 14 segments. The head is at (4, 2), and the direction is Down (D).  \n**Food Items**:  \n1. (1, 2) - value: 1, life_span: 1  \n2. (3, 2) - value: 4, life_span: 1  \n3. (5, 5) - value: 7, life_span: 1  \n4. (4, 6) - value: 10, life_span: 1  \n\n### Snake's Current Direction and Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Down (D), which means its next possible moves (without instant reverse) are Down, Left, or Right. Moving Up is not allowed because that would be the opposite of Down.\n\n### Possible Moves from Head at (4, 2):\n\n1. **Down (D)**: Move to (4, 1)\n   - Check for walls: y=1 is not a border wall, and (4,1) is not listed as an internal obstacle.\n   - Check for body collision: The snake's body segments are at (4,3), (4,4), etc. (4,1) is not in the body list.\n   - So, moving Down is safe in terms of collision.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: Move to (3, 2)\n   - Check for walls: x=3 is not a border wall, and (3,2) is not an internal obstacle (internal obstacle is at (3,1)).\n   - Check for body collision: (3,2) is not in the body list.\n   - However, there's food at (3,2) with value 4. If we move left, we'll eat this food.\n     - Need to check if eating this food is safe.\n     - After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the new tail will be where the current tail is (5,4).\n     - The current tail is at (5,4), and the segment before it is at (6,4).\n     - After moving left to (3,2) and eating, the new tail will be at (5,4), and the segment before it is (6,4).\n     - The head is at (3,2), and the new tail is at (5,4). These are not adjacent (distance is more than 1), so no immediate collision.\n     - So, eating (3,2) seems safe.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: Move to (5, 2)\n   - Check for walls: x=5 is not a border wall, and there's no internal obstacle at (5,2).\n   - Check for body collision: (5,2) is not in the body list.\n   - There's no food at (5,2), so this is just a safe move without any reward.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nLet's look at the food items:\n\n1. (1,2): value 1, life_span 1\n   - To reach this, from (4,2), we'd need to move left three times (to (3,2), then (2,2), then (1,2)).\n   - But life_span is 1, so it will disappear next turn. We can't reach it in one move, so it's not accessible now.\n\n2. (3,2): value 4, life_span 1\n   - Directly adjacent to the left. Can reach in one move.\n   - As calculated above, eating it seems safe.\n\n3.

Can't reach in one move.\n\n4. (4,6): value 10, life_span 1\n   - From (4,2), need to go up (but current direction is down, can't reverse instantly), or other paths would take multiple moves.\n   - Life_span is 1, so can't reach in one move.\n\nSo, the only food we can possibly eat this turn is at (3,2).\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe food at (4,6) is under the snake's body (specifically, the segment at (4,6) is part of the snake's body).  \nTo eat this:\n- The body must move away from (4,6), and then the head must move onto it.\n- Currently, the head is at (4,2), and the segment at (4,6) is the 9th segment (counting from head as 0).\n- To have the head reach (4,6), it would take several moves, and the body would have moved by then.\n- However, the food's life_span is 1, so it will disappear next turn. Hence, we can't eat it this turn.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nFrom the possible moves:\n\n1. Down (D) to (4,1): Safe, no food, no reward.\n2. Left (L) to (3,2): Eat food with value 4, seems safe.\n3. Right (R) to (5,2): Safe, no food, no reward.\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Left to eat the high-value food at (3,2) with value 4, as it's safe and provides the highest possible reward this turn.\n\n### Verifying Safety After Eating\n\nAfter moving Left to (3,2) and eating:\n- New head: (3,2)\n- New body: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,3), ..., (5,4)]\n- The new tail is at (5,4). The segment before tail is at (6,4).\n- Distance between head (3,2) and tail (5,4): |3-5| + |2-4| = 2 + 2 = 4 (not adjacent, so no collision).\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **Left (L)** to eat the food at (3,2) with value 4.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Possible moves (without reversing):\n\n- Left (L): (2, 2)\n- Up (U): (3, 3)\n- Down (D): (3, 1)\n\nCannot move Right (R) because that would be an instant reverse from Left.\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for safety (no collision with body or walls):\n\n1. **Left (L) to (2, 2)**:\n   - Check walls: x=0 is a wall, but (2, 2) is not a wall.\n   - Check body: Is (2, 2) in the snake's body? Looking at the positions, (2, 5), (2, 6) are body parts, but not (2, 2). So, safe.\n   \n2. **Up (U) to (3, 3)**:\n   - Check walls: No walls at (3, 3).\n   - Check body: Is (3, 3) in the body? The body segments are at (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6), etc. Not (3, 3). Safe.\n   \n3. **Down (D) to (3, 1)**:\n   - Check walls: There's an internal wall at (3, 1). So, this is a wall collision. Not safe.\n\nSo, safe moves are Left and Up.\n\n### Evaluating Food Positions\n\nNow, let's see if we can reach any food with these moves:\n\n1. **Food at (5, 5)**:\n   - Current head at (3, 2). Distance is |5-3| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n   - Not reachable in one move.\n   \n2. **Food at (4, 6)**:\n   - Current head at (3, 2). Distance is |4-3| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5.\n   - Not reachable in one move.\n   \nHowever, the food at (4, 6) is actually under the snake's body (specifically, the 10th segment is at (4, 6)). \n\nFrom the rules:\n- Food under the body can only be eaten if:\n  1. The body moves away, and\n  2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nCurrently, the head is at (3, 2), and the food is at (4, 6). Even if the body moves, the head cannot reach (4, 6) in one move from (3, 2). So, we cannot eat this food now.\n\nSimilarly, the food at (5, 5) is not under the body and is also not reachable in one move.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nSince no food is immediately reachable, our goal is to move safely without colliding and possibly position ourselves to eat food in future turns.\n\nFrom safe moves Left and Up:\n\n1. **Left to (2, 2)**:\n   - New head position: (2, 2)\n   - Next possible moves from there (assuming direction is now Left):\n     - Left to (1, 2)\n     - Up to (2, 3)\n     - Down to (2, 1)\n   - This seems safe but doesn't seem to lead towards any food directly.\n\n2. **Up to (3, 3)**:\n   - New head position: (3, 3)\n   - Next possible moves from there (assuming direction is now Up):\n     - Up to (3, 4)\n     - Left to (2, 3)\n     - Right to (4, 3)\n   - Moving Up could bring us closer to the food at (5, 5) over time.\n\nBetween Left and Up, moving Up seems slightly better as it moves the head towards the center where the food at (5, 5) is located, whereas Left moves towards the edge.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nFrom the rules:\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nThe tail is the last segment: (5, 4). \n\nCurrent head is at (3, 2), tail at (5, 4). Distance is |5-3| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4, not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1). So, no immediate danger here.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween the two safe moves (Left and Up), moving Up seems more promising as it moves the snake towards the center where the food is located, whereas Left moves towards the edge where there's less opportunity to find food in the future.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move Up.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

But we need to consider all possible moves and their validity.\n\nPossible directions from (3, 3):\n- Up (U): (3, 4)\n- Down (D): (3, 2) — but this is the body segment right behind the head; moving here would collide with the body.\n- Left (L): (2, 3)\n- Right (R): (4, 3)\n\n**Current direction is U**, so the opposite direction is D, which is invalid (cannot reverse instantly). So, possible moves are U, L, R.\n\nNow, check each:\n\n1. **Up (U) to (3, 4)**:\n   - Check if (3,4) is a wall: No walls at (3,4).\n   - Check if (3,4) is part of the body: Looking at the snake positions, (3,4) is not listed, so it's safe.\n   - No food at (3,4).\n\n2. **Left (L) to (2, 3)**:\n   - Check walls: (2,3) is not a wall.\n   - Check body: (2,3) is not in the snake's body positions.\n   - No food at (2,3).\n\n3. **Right (R) to (4, 3)**:\n   - Check walls: (4,3) is not a wall.\n   - Check body: (4,3) is part of the body (third segment). Moving here would collide with the body.\n   - So, R is invalid.\n\nSo, valid moves are U and L.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food:\n\n1. (5, 5, 6, 1):\n   - Position: (5,5)\n   - Value: +6 (positive food)\n   - Life_span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n   - Currently, the snake's head is at (3,3). To reach (5,5), it would take multiple moves, so not immediately accessible.\n\n2. (4, 6, 8, 1):\n   - Position: (4,6)\n   - Value: +8 (positive food)\n   - Life_span: 1 (will disappear after this turn)\n   - Currently, (4,6) is occupied by the snake's body (10th segment). \n     - To eat this, the body must move away, and the head must move onto (4,6) in the same turn.\n     - The body segment at (4,6) is followed by (5,6), so the tail is moving towards (6,5), etc.\n     - For the head to reach (4,6) in one move from (3,3), it would need to move Right (to (4,3)), then Down (to (4,2)), then Left (to (3,2)) — but this is multiple steps and not immediate.\n     - Alternatively, moving Up to (3,4), then Right to (4,4), then Down to (4,3), etc., still not immediate.\n     - So, cannot eat (4,6) this turn.\n\nGiven that, neither food can be eaten this turn directly. \n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\n- Tail is at (6,4).\n- Adjacent to tail: (5,4), (6,3), (6,5), (7,4).\n- Head is at (3,3), not adjacent to tail, so no immediate danger here.\n\n### Choosing Between U and L\n\nNow, between U and L, which is better?\n\n1. **Up (U) to (3,4)**:\n   - Moves towards the center of the grid.\n   - Opens up more options for future moves.\n   - Not moving towards any immediate food, but safe.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (2,3)**:\n   - Moves towards the left border (x=0 is a wall, but we're at x=2 now).\n   - Also safe, but may limit future options if we get too close to the wall.\n\nGiven that both moves are safe and neither leads directly to food, I'd prefer Up to keep more options open for future moves.\n\n### Checking Future Moves After U\n\nIf we go Up to (3,4), next turn:\n- Head at (3,4), came from (3,3).\n- Possible moves: U (to (3,5)), L (to (2,4)), R (to (4,4)).\n   - (3,5): part of body (6th segment), so U is invalid.\n   - (2,4): not in body, not wall.\n   - (4,4): part of body (4th segment), so R is invalid.\n- So next move would be forced to L to (2,4), which is okay but limits options.\n\nAlternatively, if we go Left to (2,3) now:\n- Next turn, head at (2,3), came from (3,3).\n- Possible moves: U (to (2,4)), D (to (2,2)), L (to (1,3)).\n   - Opposite of came from is R, so no restriction.\n   - (2,4): not body, not wall.\n   - (2,2): not body, not wall.\n   - (1,3): not body, not wall.\n- More options next turn.\n\nGiven that, Left might give more flexibility next turn.\n\n### Re-evaluating Food Accessibility\n\nThe food at (5,5) is +6, life_span 1, so it will disappear after this turn. It's at (5,5), and our head is at (3,3). To reach it in one move is impossible, but is there a path where moving now helps in getting closer?\n\nFrom (3,3):\n- To reach (5,5), need to go Right and Down.\n- Moving Left now doesn't help.\n- Moving Up to (3,4), then next turn maybe Right to (4,4), then Down to (4,3), etc., still not reaching (5,5) in time.\n\nSimilarly, the food at (4,6) is under the body and can't be eaten this turn.\n\nSo food is not a factor this turn.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that:\n- Both U and L are safe.\n- L provides more flexibility next turn.\n- No immediate food to consider.\n- No immediate danger.\n\nI think Left is slightly better to keep options open.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

No internal wall at (1,3).\n- **Body Collision**: Check if (1,3) is in the snake's body.\n  - Snake body: [(3,3), (3,2), ..., (6,5)].

Distance from (2,2) to (6,5) is |2-6| + |2-5| = 4 + 3 = 7, which is not adjacent.\n    - No danger here.\n  - **Eating Food**: Moving to (2,2) would eat the food, increasing length by 1 and score by 10.\n    - After eating, the tail remains where it is, and the head moves to (2,2).\n    - The new tail would be the second-to-last segment, but since the snake grows, the tail doesn't move this turn.\n    - Need to ensure that the new position doesn't cause a collision next turn.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nLooking at the food:\n1.

(2,2): value=10, life_span=1.\n   - Reachable in one move (Down).\n   - As analyzed, safe to eat.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- **Life Span**: All foods have life_span=1, meaning they disappear next turn. So, if we don't eat (2,2) now, it's gone.\n- **Future Moves**: After moving to (2,2), the next moves need to be considered to avoid trapping the snake.\n  - From (2,2), possible moves:\n    - Left (L): (1,2) - need to check if it's safe.\n    - Right (R): (3,2) - part of the body (current position has (3,2)).\n    - Up (U): (2,3) - original head position, but now it's the second segment.\n    - Down (D): (2,1) - within bounds, no body or wall.\n    - So, after eating, possible moves are L or D.\n\n### Decision Making\n\n- **Option 1: Move Down (D) to (2,2)**:\n  - Immediate reward of +10.\n  - Next turn, can move Left or Down to avoid collision.\n- **Option 2: Move Left (L) to (1,3)** or Up (U) to (2,4):\n  - No immediate reward.\n  - Food at (2,2) disappears next turn.\n  - Less optimal since we miss a high-value food.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe Tail Reward Danger occurs if:\n- Head is adjacent to the tail.\n- Tail cell has positive food.\n- Eating it would cause head and new tail to collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Tail is at (6,5).\n- Head is at (2,3), not adjacent to tail.\n- Food is at (2,2), not at the tail.\n- No danger here.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down (D) to (2,2) to eat the high-value food (10 points) before it disappears.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 50  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacle: (3,1)\n\n**Snake Positions** (head first):\n[(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5)]\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: D (Down)\n\n**Food**:\n1. (5, 5), value=1, life_span=4\n2. (4, 6), value=1, life_span=6\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nFirst, let's visualize the snake's position to understand its shape and possible movements.\n\n- Head: (2, 2) - facing Down (D)\n- Next segment: (2, 3)\n- Then: (3, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), ..., (6, 5)\n\nThe snake is quite long (16 segments). The tail is at (6,5).\n\nFood positions:\n- (5,5): This is one cell to the right and three cells down from the head (2,2) → (5,5) is (x+3, y+3)\n- (4,6): This is two cells right and four cells down from the head (2,2) → (4,6) is (x+2, y+4)\n\nBut the head is at (2,2) facing Down, so possible moves from (2,2) are:\n- Down (D): (2,1) - but y=0 is a wall, so (2,1) is invalid (y=0 is a wall)\n- Left (L): (1,2) - x=0 is a wall, so (1,2) is invalid\n- Right (R): (3,2) - check if this is part of the snake's body\n  - Looking at snake positions: (3,2) is the 4th segment (index 3 in 0-based)\n  - Moving to (3,2) would mean the head collides with the body (since the tail is at (6,5) and won't have moved yet)\n  - So, Right is invalid\n- Up (U): (2,3) - this is the second segment of the snake\n  - Moving Up would make the head go to (2,3), which is currently occupied by the second segment\n  - After moving, the tail would move forward, so (2,3) would be free, but since the head moves first, this would cause a collision\n  - So, Up is invalid\n\nWait a minute, this seems problematic. From (2,2) facing Down, the possible moves are D, L, R, U but:\n- D: (2,1) - wall\n- L: (1,2) - wall\n- R: (3,2) - body collision (with (3,2))\n- U: (2,3) - body collision (with (2,3))\n\nThis seems like all moves lead to a collision or wall. But the rules say that moving into the tail is allowed because the tail moves forward. So let's re-examine:\n\n**Tail Movement Rule**: The tail will move forward after the head moves, so the current tail position (6,5) will be vacated, and the new tail will be the second-to-last segment (6,6).\n\nNow, let's check moving Right to (3,2):\n- Current snake body segments after head: (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), ..., (6,5)\n- (3,2) is the 4th segment (index 3)\n- After moving head to (3,2), the tail moves, so the segment at (6,5) is removed\n- The new snake would be: [(3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), ..., (6,6)]\n- Now, (3,2) is both the new head and is also present later in the body (after (3,3)), so this is a collision\n- Hence, Right is invalid\n\nMoving Up to (2,3):\n- New head: (2,3)\n- Tail moves: remove (6,5), new tail is (6,6)\n- New snake: [(2,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), ..., (6,6)]\n- (2,3) is repeated, so collision\n- Hence, Up is invalid\n\nSo, all moves seem to lead to collisions or walls. This suggests the snake is in a position where it cannot move without dying. But let's double-check the food positions to see if any food is under the snake that can be eaten by moving away.\n\n**Food Under Snake**:\n- Food at (4,6): current snake positions include (4,6) (index 12 in 0-based)\n- To eat this, the body must move away, then head moves onto it\n- Currently, the head is at (2,2), far from (4,6), so this isn't immediately helpful\n- Food at (5,5): not under the snake\n\nGiven that all immediate moves lead to death, the snake has no valid moves to survive. However, the rules mention that moving into the tail is allowed if the tail moves away, but in our checks, that still causes a collision because the tail's movement doesn't free up the space in time to prevent the head from colliding with the body.\n\nThis seems like a \"game over\" scenario where no move is possible without collision. But since the problem asks for an action, and assuming the snake must make a move, perhaps the least bad option is to move Right into (3,2), accepting the collision, but the rules say that's deadly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed that the tail is at (6,5), and moving into a body segment that is the tail is allowed because the tail moves. Let me re-examine moving Right to (3,2):\n\nCurrent body segments after head:\n(2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), ..., (6,5)\n\n(3,2) is the 4th segment (index 3). After moving head to (3,2), the tail (6,5) moves, so the new body is:\n(2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), ..., (6,6)\n\nNow, is (3,2) in the new body? Yes, it's the new head and also appears later after (3,3). So it's a collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving Up to (2,3):\nNew head: (2,3)\nNew body: (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), ..., (6,6)\n(2,3) appears twice, so collision.\n\nThus, no valid moves. But since the problem expects an answer, perhaps the initial assumption about the tail is incorrect. Maybe the tail is only the very last segment, and moving into the second-to-last is allowed if the tail moves away.\n\nWait, the snake is:\n[(2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)]\n\nTail is (6,5), second-to-last is (6,6). Moving into (6,6) would be allowed if the tail is at (6,5), because after moving head to (6,6), tail moves from (6,5), so (6,6) is only the head, no collision.\n\nBut our head is at (2,2), far from (6,6). So this doesn't help.\n\nGiven that, it seems the snake is trapped with no possible moves that don't result in collision or hitting a wall. Therefore, the snake must choose a move that leads to death, and the answer could be any of the directions, but typically in such cases, the game would end.\n\nHowever, since the problem asks for an action, and all actions lead to death, I'll choose Right as it's one of the possible moves, even though it leads to a collision.\n\n\\boxed{R}",
