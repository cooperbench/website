        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0,0) at turn t1, which is given as t0 = 0. So t1 = 0. The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. Since we start at y=0 and want to go to y=9, moving down isn't useful, so we'll probably only use U and S, but D might be needed to avoid cars, but since cars are only on y=1 to 8, and we start at y=0, going down might not help, but let's see.\n\ny=0 is the starting point, and y=9 is the target, both should be safe, I think. The collision only happens on freeways y=1 to 8, and only if at that turn, the player is on that freeway and 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, if there is a car such that 0 is in its span at turn T, then collision occurs.\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn T, after action, y_{T+1} is set, but the position at turn T is y_T, so when you decide to move at turn T, you are on y_T during turn T, and you move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you won't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T. Only at turn T+1 you might be on y_{T+1}.\n\nBut at turn T, you are on y_T, so you care about cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, the car states are given for turn t1=0.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (head=48, tail=37, direction=right, speed=12)\n\nSince direction is right, and head and tail, for right-moving, span is [τ, h], so here τ=37, h=48? It says (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nIn the table: Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor right-moving: span at t is [τ, h], and it moves with speed s, so at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut here all cars are right-moving, I think. Direction is \"right\" for all.\n\nIn freeway 1: (48,37,right,12) — head=48, tail=37, but for right-moving, head is the front, so if it's moving right, tail is left, so span [tail, head] = [37,48]\n\nAt time T, position is [37 + 12T, 48 + 12T] since t1=0.\n\nt1=0, so T is the turn number from start.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-48,-59,right,6)\n\ntail=-59, head=-48, span [-59,-48] at t=0, at T, [-59 + 6T, -48 + 6T]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-48,-59,right,6) identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: same, (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: same, (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (-48,-59,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6)\n\nFirst car: tail=-59, head=-48, span [-59,-48] at t=0, at T, [-59 + 6T, -48 + 6T]\n\nSecond car: head=-12, tail=-23, so for right, span [tail,head] = [-23,-12] at t=0, at T, [-23 + 6T, -12 + 6T]\n\nThird car: head=24, tail=13, span [13,24] at t=0, at T, [13 + 6T, 24 + 6T]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (-48,-59,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6)\n\nNow, freeway 1 has one car with speed 12, others have speed 6.\n\nThe player starts at y=0 at turn 0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, so we need to move up 9 times, but we can stay or move down to avoid cars, but moving down from y=0 might not be possible since y=0 is min, but the update says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so if y_t=0 and we do D, y_{t+1} = -1, but it says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so probably it clamps or something? Let me check.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]. It doesn't specify what happens if out of bound, but since it says ∈ [0,9], I think we assume that the action is invalid or it stays, but the problem says \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\", so probably the action is only applied if it keeps y in bounds, or perhaps it's clamped. To be safe, I think we should only take actions that keep y within 0 to 9, so from y=0, we can't do D, similarly from y=9, can't do U.\n\nSo at y=0, possible actions: U or S (move up or stay)\n\nAt y=9, U might not be possible, but we want to reach y=9, so once there, we can stop or something.\n\nNow, collision: at each turn T, when the player is at y_T, if y_T between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\n0 is the x-position, I assume, since the grid is 2D, but player is always at x=0, I think, since position is (0, y_t), so player is always on x=0.\n\nAnd cars are on the freeways, which are horizontal, I assume, so their span is in x-direction.\n\nSo collision if at turn T, y_T = k for some k=1 to 8, and on freeway k, there is a car such that 0 is in [left, right] of the car at time T.\n\nFor each freeway and each car, we need to know when 0 is covered by the car at time T.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, and cars move horizontally.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=0, we need to pass through each y=1 to 8 at some point, but we can stay on a row or move up/down to avoid the cars when they are at x=0.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 9, since we need to increase y by 9, and each U increases by 1, S or D don't, so if we only go up, H=9 turns: start turn 0 at y=0, after first action at turn 0, y=1 or 0, etc.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, we perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe state at turn t: position is (0, y_t)\n\nAfter action a_t, we go to y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nThe sequence is from t= t1 to t1 + H -1, so H actions over H turns? Let's see.\n\nThe player starts at turn t1 with position (0, y_{t1})\n\nThen we apply actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nAfter a_{t1}, y_{t1 +1} is set\n\nAfter a_{t1 +1}, y_{t1 +2} is set, and so on, up to after a_{t1 + H -1}, y_{t1 + H} is set.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} = 9? No.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1, so for t from t1 to t1 + H -1, we apply a_t, and after H actions, at turn t1 + H, y_{t1 + H} should be 9.\n\nSince we start at turn t1, after 0 actions, y_{t1} is given.\n\nAfter first action a_{t1}, y_{t1 +1} is new position.\n\nAfter k actions, position is y_{t1 + k}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} = 9, with H minimal.\n\nAnd we need to avoid collision at each turn from t1 to t1 + H -1? Let's see when collision is checked.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if at that turn, the player is on a freeway y_T between 1 and 8, and 0 is in the car span for that freeway at T.\n\nAt turn T, position is (0, y_T), and if y_T in 1-8, and collision condition.\n\nThe actions are applied at each turn, and after action, we have the new position for next turn.\n\nBut during turn T, we are at y_T before action or after? I think the position is given at the start of the turn or during.\n\nFrom the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nSo at turn T, you are at y_T, and you perform action to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision is checked based on y_T at turn T.\n\nFor each turn from t1 onwards, as long as we are on y=1-8, we need to ensure that at that turn, for that freeway, 0 is not in any car's span.\n\nIf we are on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible, since no freeway or not between 1-8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid the times when cars are at x=0.\n\nFor each freeway, we need to find times when it is unsafe, i.e., 0 is covered by a car.\n\nThen, when we are on that row, it must be at a safe time.\n\nSince we can stay on a row, we can wait for a safe time to be there.\n\nBut staying increases H, so to minimize H, we should only stay when necessary to avoid.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway the times when 0 is covered.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, span at T: [37 + 12T, 48 + 12T] since right-moving, t1=0.\n\n0 is in [37+12T, 48+12T] when 37+12T <= 0 <= 48+12T\n\nSince 37+12T <= 0 and 0 <= 48+12T\n\nFirst, 37+12T <= 0 => 12T <= -37 => T <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, but T >=0, so never true for T>=0.\n\n37+12T <= 0: 12T <= -37, T <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, since T>=0, this inequality is false for all T>=0.\n\nThen 0 <= 48+12T is always true for T>=0 since 48+12T >=48>0.\n\nSo 0 is in [37+12T, 48+12T] only if both inequalities, but since left end 37+12T >0 for T>=0? 37+12T at T=0 is 37>0, so min is 37, max 48, both positive, so 0 < 37 <= x <=48, so 0 is not in [37,48] or any [37+12T,48+12T] for T>=0. Since the span is always between 37 and up, never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, for T<0 it might, but we start at T=0, so for freeway 1, the car never covers x=0 at any T>=0. So freeway 1 is always safe? Let me confirm.\n\nSpan [37+12T, 48+12T], at T=0: [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=1: [49,60], etc., always above 37>0, so yes, x=0 never covered for freeway 1. So freeway 1 is always safe; we can be on y=1 at any time.\n\nNow freeway 2: car (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nTail=-59, head=-48, so span at T: [-59 + 6T, -48 + 6T]\n\n0 in [-59+6T, -48+6T] when -59+6T <= 0 <= -48+6T\n\nFirst, -59+6T <= 0 => 6T <= 59 => T <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833, so T <=9 since T integer.\n\nSecond, 0 <= -48+6T => 6T >=48 => T >=8.\n\nSo for T from 8 to 9 inclusive.\n\nT>=8 and T<=9.\n\nT=8: -59+48 = -11, -48+48=0? Let's compute:\n\nAt T=8: -59 + 6*8 = -59 + 48 = -11\n\n-48 + 48 = 0\n\nSo span [-11, 0]\n\n0 is included, since <=0 and >= -11? -11 <= 0 <= 0, yes 0 is in [-11,0].\n\nSimilarly, T=9: -59 + 54 = -5, -48 + 54 = 6, span [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nT=10: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nT=7: -59+42=-17, -48+42=-6, span [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe for T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut freeway 2 has only one car? From table, freeway 2 has one car: (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3,4,5,6 all have the same car: (-48,-59,right,6), so each has identical car, so for each of freeway 2 to 6, unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2, etc.\n\nNow freeway 7: multiple cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6) same as above, span at T: [-59+6T, -48+6T]\n\nThis car covers 0 when T=8,9 as above.\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,6) head=-12, tail=-23, so for right, span [tail, head] = [-23,-12] at T=0, at T, [-23+6T, -12+6T]\n\n0 in [-23+6T, -12+6T] when -23+6T <= 0 <= -12+6T\n\nFirst: -23+6T <=0 => 6T<=23 => T<=23/6≈3.833, T<=3\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12+6T => 6T>=12 => T>=2\n\nSo T from 2 to 3 inclusive.\n\nT=2: -23+12= -11, -12+12=0, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nT=3: -23+18= -5, -12+18=6, span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nT=4: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nT=1: -23+6= -17, -12+6= -6, [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe for this car at T=2,3.\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,6) head=24, tail=13, span [13,24] at T=0, at T [13+6T,24+6T]\n\nMin at T=0 is 13>0, so never covers 0 for T>=0.\n\nSimilarly for all T.\n\nSo for freeway 7, we have:\n\n- First car: unsafe at T=8,9\n\n- Second car: unsafe at T=2,3\n\n- Third car: always safe\n\nSo freeway 7 is unsafe when either car is unsafe, so at T=2,3 (from second car) and T=8,9 (from first car).\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 has the same cars as freeway 7: (-48,-59,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6), so identical to freeway 7, unsafe at T=2,3 and T=8,9.\n\nNow freeway 1: always safe, as we saw.\n\nFreeway 2 to 6: each has one car unsafe at T=8,9 only.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: unsafe at T=2,3 and T=8,9.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nStart at turn 0, y=0.\n\nAt each turn, we choose action to set next y.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince we can stay or move, but moving down from low y might not be useful.\n\ny=0 is safe, y=9 is safe.\n\nThe dangerous rows are y=1 to 8, but only at certain times.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- y=1: freeway 1, always safe, so we can be on y=1 at any time.\n\n- y=2: freeway 2, unsafe only at T=8,9, so safe except T=8,9\n\nSimilarly, y=3: freeway 3, same as y=2, unsafe only T=8,9\n\ny=4: freeway 4, same, unsafe T=8,9\n\ny=5: freeway 5, same\n\ny=6: freeway 6, same\n\ny=7: freeway 7, unsafe at T=2,3 and T=8,9\n\ny=8: freeway 8, unsafe at T=2,3 and T=8,9\n\nNow, we need to plan the path.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a row when it is unsafe for that row.\n\nSince y=1 is always safe, we can go to y=1 immediately.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 to y=6 are safe except at T=8,9, but T=8,9 are later, so if we go up fast, we might be past y=6 before T=8.\n\nSimilarly for y=7 and y=8, they are unsafe at T=2,3 and T=8,9.\n\nT=2,3 is early.\n\nLet me think about the timeline.\n\nStart at turn 0: y=0, safe.\n\nWe apply action a_0 to set y_1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 at some turn, say turn H, after H actions.\n\nSince we start at turn 0, after H actions, at turn H, y_H should be 9.\n\nThe turns we care about are from turn 0 to turn H-1 for positions y_0 to y_{H-1}, but collision at turn T depends on y_T.\n\nFor turn T, position y_T, if y_T in 1-8, and unsafe at that T for that row.\n\ny_0 is at turn 0, y_1 at turn 1, etc.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need y_H =9 for some H.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to t=H-1, setting y_1 to y_H.\n\ny_0 is given.\n\nNow, minimal H: at least 9, if we go up every turn.\n\nBut we might need to stay or detour to avoid unsafe times.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can go straight up without waiting.\n\nSuppose we always go up: actions all U.\n\nThen y_t = t for t=0 to 9? Start y_0=0\n\nAfter a_0=U, y_1=1\n\na_1=U, y_2=2\n\n...\n\na_8=U, y_9=9\n\nAfter 9 actions, y_9=9.\n\nNow, check collision at each turn.\n\nTurn T=0: y_0=0, safe (not on freeway)\n\nTurn T=1: y_1=1, freeway 1, always safe, ok.\n\nTurn T=2: y_2=2, freeway 2, unsafe at T=8,9, but T=2 not 8 or 9, so safe? Freeway 2 unsafe only at T=8,9, so at T=2, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=3: y_3=3, freeway 3, safe except T=8,9, T=3≠8,9, safe.\n\nT=4: y_4=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nT=5: y_5=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\nT=6: y_6=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nT=7: y_7=7, freeway 7, unsafe at T=2,3 and T=8,9. T=7 not 2,3 or 8,9, so should be safe? T=7, is it unsafe?\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at T=2,3 and T=8,9. T=7 not in {2,3,8,9}, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=8: y_8=8, freeway 8, unsafe at T=2,3 and T=8,9. T=8 is unsafe for freeway 8.\n\nAt T=8, y_8=8, which is freeway 8, and unsafe at T=8, so collision.\n\nIn this path, at turn 8, we are on y=8, and it is unsafe, so collision.\n\nThus, we cannot go straight up without modification.\n\nT=8 is unsafe for y=8.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 8, y_8=8, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 9, if we were on y=8, but in this case y_9=9, but turn 9 position is y_9=9, safe.\n\nBut at turn 8, collision.\n\nSo need to avoid being on y=8 at turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nIn this case, for the all-up path, only turn 8 has issue if we are on y=8.\n\nBut we are on y=8 at turn 8.\n\nNow, y=7 and y=8 are also unsafe at T=2,3, but in this path at T=2 we are on y=2, which is safe, etc.\n\nOnly at T=8, on y=8, unsafe.\n\nTo fix, we can either not be on y=8 at T=8, or be on a different row.\n\nSince we need to go to y=9, we can delay or advance the time we are on y=8.\n\nFor example, we can stay on lower rows longer to avoid being on y=8 at T=8.\n\nOr go faster to be on y=8 earlier or later.\n\nBut y=8 is unsafe only at T=8,9? Freeway 8 unsafe at T=2,3 and T=8,9.\n\nSimilarly for y=7.\n\nIn the all-up path, we are on y=7 at T=7, which is safe, since T=7 not unsafe time for y=7.\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=2,3,8,9, T=7 not in, safe.\n\ny=8 at T=8 unsafe.\n\nNow, T=9 is also unsafe for y=8.\n\nBut if we can be on y=8 at T not 8 or 9, and not 2 or 3.\n\nFor example, at T=7 or earlier, or T=10 or later.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so later might increase H.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nFirst, let's list the unsafe times for each row:\n\n- y=1: always safe\n\n- y=2: unsafe only at T=8,9\n\n- y=3: unsafe only at T=8,9\n\n- y=4: unsafe only at T=8,9\n\n- y=5: unsafe only at T=8,9\n\n- y=6: unsafe only at T=8,9\n\n- y=7: unsafe at T=2,3 and T=8,9\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=2,3 and T=8,9\n\ny=2 to y=6 all unsafe only at T=8,9, since each has a car that is unsafe only at those times.\n\ny=7 and y=8 unsafe at T=2,3 and T=8,9.\n\nT=2 and 3 are early, T=8 and 9 are later.\n\nIn the all-up path, we hit y=8 at T=8, which is bad.\n\nWe need to avoid that.\n\nOptions:\n\n1. Be on y=8 at a different time, not T=8 or 9.\n\nFor example, earlier than T=8 or later.\n\nBut earlier: if we go up faster, but we can only go up one per turn, so to be on y=8 at T=7, for example.\n\nAt T=7, y=8? Turn T, position y_T.\n\nIf we want y_T=8 at T=7, for example.\n\nSimilarly, later, but that might delay.\n\n2. Stay on some row to delay reaching y=8.\n\nBut staying might increase H.\n\nSince y=7 is safe at T=7, we can be on y=7 at T=7, then if we stay or go up.\n\nBut at T=8, if we go up to y=8, then y_8=8 at turn 8, collision.\n\nIf we stay on y=7 at T=8, then y_8=7, which is freeway 7, unsafe at T=8, since freeway 7 unsafe at T=8.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at T=8, so if we are on y=7 at T=8, also collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we are on y=6 at T=8, y=6 unsafe at T=8,9, so also collision.\n\nIn fact, for any y=2 to 8, at T=8 or T=9, it is unsafe, except y=1, but y=1 is safe always.\n\ny=1 safe always, so at T=8, if we are on y=1, safe.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nThe only safe rows at T=8 and T=9 are y=0, y=9, and y=1.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so always safe.\n\ny=1 is freeway but always safe.\n\nAt T=8 and T=9, we must not be on y=2 to y=8, because all are unsafe at those times.\n\nFor y=2 to y=6, unsafe only at T=8,9, so at T=8,9, if on y=2 to6, collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and y=8 also unsafe at T=8,9.\n\nSo at T=8 and T=9, the only safe positions are y=0, y=1, or y=9.\n\nSimilarly, at T=2 and T=3, for y=7 and y=8, they are unsafe, but other rows are safe at T=2,3.\n\ny=2 to6 are safe at T=2,3, only unsafe at T=8,9.\n\ny=1 always safe.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nWe need to ensure that at turn 8 and turn 9, we are not on y=2 to y=8.\n\nSo we must be on y=0, y=1, or y=9 at those turns.\n\nBut y=0 is only at start, turn 0.\n\ny=9 is the target.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 2 and 3, we need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8, but since we start from low, at turn 2 and 3, we are on low rows, so not a problem.\n\nFor example, in all-up, at T=2, y=2, safe; T=3, y=3, safe.\n\nOnly issue is T=8.\n\nNow, to avoid being on y=2-8 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSince we start from y=0, and go to y=9, we need to be past the dangerous rows by T=7 or before, or delay until after T=9.\n\nBut after T=9, T=10 etc., but that might be late.\n\nMinimal H, so we want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nEarliest possible: if no cars, H=9, reach at turn 9.\n\nBut with cars, we need to avoid T=8 and T=9 on middle rows.\n\nOne way: be on y=1 at T=8 and T=9, but y=1 is safe, so we can stay on y=1 during T=8 and T=9.\n\nThen after that, go up.\n\nBut staying increases H.\n\nAnother way: reach y=9 before T=8, but to reach y=9 at turn T, we need at least T=9 actions? Start turn 0, after k actions, at turn k, y_k.\n\nTo have y_k = k, if all up, y_k = k at turn k.\n\ny_9=9 at turn 9.\n\nBut turn 9 is after 9 actions.\n\nTurn 9 position is y_9.\n\nAt turn 9, if y_9=9, safe.\n\nBut at turn 8, if y_8=8, unsafe.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 8, is it possible? Only if we can go up faster, but each up increases y by 1, from y=0 to y=9, need 9 up moves, so minimum 9 turns to reach, so y_9=9 at earliest.\n\ny_t at turn t.\n\ny_0 = 0\n\nAfter first U, y_1 =1\n\n...\n\nAfter ninth U, y_9=9\n\nSo we cannot reach y=9 before turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 8, we must have y_8 <=8, since we start from 0.\n\nIf y_8=8, unsafe; if less, might be unsafe if on dangerous row.\n\nBut at turn 8, we must be on y=0,1, or9, but y=9 impossible at turn 8, so must be on y=0 or y=1.\n\nSimilarly at turn 9, must be on y=1 or y=9.\n\ny=0 only possible at turn 0, so at turn 8, we must be on y=1.\n\nAt turn 9, we can be on y=1 or y=9.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to reach y=9 as soon as possible, so probably at turn 9.\n\nBut at turn 9, if y_9=9, good.\n\nBut we need to be on y=1 at turn 8.\n\nThen from there, we can go to y=9 quickly.\n\nNow, also, at turn 2 and 3, we need to not be on y=7 or y=8, but since we start low, we will be on low rows at early turns, so not a problem if we go directly.\n\nFor example, at turn 2, if we are on y=2, safe; turn 3, y=3, safe.\n\ny=7 and y=8 unsafe at T=2,3, but we won't be there that early.\n\nSo only the T=8,9 issue matters.\n\nSo plan: we need to be on y=1 at turn 8.\n\nThen at turn 8, we are safe.\n\nThen from turn 8 to turn 9, we can go up to y=2 or stay, but we need to go to y=9.\n\nBut at turn 9, we need to be on y=1 or y=9 to be safe.\n\nIf we go up from y=1 at turn 8, to y=2 at turn 9, but at turn 9, y=2, which is unsafe since y=2 unsafe at T=9.\n\nSo if we are on y=2 at turn 9, collision.\n\nSimilarly, any y=2-8 at turn 9 unsafe.\n\nSo at turn 9, we must be on y=1 or y=9.\n\nIf we are on y=1 at turn 8, we can:\n\n- Stay: then y_9=1, safe, but not at target.\n\nThen later go up.\n\n- Go up to y=2: then y_9=2, unsafe.\n\n- But we can go up multiple times? No, each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nFrom y=1 at turn 8, after action a_8, y_9 = y_8 + Δy, so y_9 could be 0,1,2.\n\nBut y=0: if we go down, but from y=1, D to y=0, but y=0 is safe, but we are going away from target.\n\nThen y_9=0.\n\nThen we need to go back up, which takes more turns.\n\nTo reach y=9, from y=0 or y=1, it takes 9 or 8 up moves, but with turns.\n\nIf we are at y=1 at turn 8, and we want to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nAt turn 9, if we go up to y=2, but y_9=2, unsafe.\n\nIf we stay, y_9=1, safe.\n\nThen at turn 10, we can go up to y=2, but now at turn 10, y=2 is safe, since unsafe only at T=8,9.\n\nSimilarly, then we can go up each turn to y=9 at turn 17 or something, but that is late, H=17 turns to reach y=9 at turn 17.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nSince at turn 8 we are on y=1, safe.\n\nAt turn 9, we must be on y=1 or y=9 to be safe.\n\nBut y=9 not reachable yet.\n\nSo only choice is to be on y=1 at turn 9, by staying.\n\nThen at turn 9, y_9=1, safe.\n\nNow, from there, we can start going up.\n\nAt turn 10, we can go to y=2, which is safe since T=10>9.\n\nThen y=3 at T=11, safe, and so on, up to y=9 at turn 18? Let's see.\n\nStart: turn 0, y=0\n\nWe need to reach y=1 by turn 8? Not necessarily, we need to be on y=1 at turn 8.\n\nBut we start at y=0 turn 0.\n\nTo be on y=1 at turn 8, we can arrive earlier or later.\n\nSince y=1 is always safe, we can be on it at any time.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows except at unsafe times.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go up as much as possible until we need to wait.\n\nSpecifically, to avoid being on middle rows at T=8 and T=9, we should be on y=1 at those turns.\n\nThen after T=9, we can go up freely.\n\nSo, we can go up to y=1 quickly, then stay on y=1 during T=8 and T=9, then go up to y=9.\n\nBut we need to be on y=1 at turn 8 and turn 9.\n\nTurn 8 and turn 9 are two turns.\n\nAt turn 8, position y_8 must be 1.\n\nAt turn 9, y_9 must be 1 or 9.\n\nBut if y_9=1, we stay.\n\nThen from turn 10, go up each turn to y=9 at turn 18.\n\nBut we can reach y=1 earlier and wait.\n\nFor example, go to y=1 at turn 1, then stay from turn 1 to turn 9? But that would be many stays, H larger.\n\nWe should go up to some point, then come back to y=1 for T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut going down might not help.\n\nSince y=1 is safe, we can stay on y=1 for multiple turns.\n\nTo minimize the time to reach y=9, we should spend as little time as possible waiting, so we should reach y=1 as late as possible before turn 8, but we need to be there at turn 8.\n\nWe can go up to y=6 or something, but at turn 8, we must be on y=1, so we need to be at y=1 at turn 8, which means we must have descended or never left.\n\nBut descending takes extra turns.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to y=7 at turn 7, which is safe, as before.\n\nThen at turn 8, if we go down to y=6, but y=6 at turn 8 is unsafe, since y=6 unsafe at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, go to y=7 or y=8, all unsafe.\n\nOr go to y=0, but from y=7, D to y=6, not to 0 directly.\n\ny changes by at most 1 per turn.\n\nFrom y=7 at turn 7, possible actions: S, y_8=7; U, y_8=8; D, y_8=6.\n\nAll of which are unsafe at turn 8: y=6,7,8 all unsafe at T=8.\n\ny=5, etc., down to y=2, all unsafe.\n\nOnly y=1 safe.\n\nSo from any position at turn 7, except y=1, we cannot go to a safe position at turn 8 directly if we are not on y=1.\n\nIf at turn 7 we are on y=1, then at turn 8 we can stay or go down to y=0 or up to y=2, but going up to y=2 at turn 8 is unsafe.\n\nSo only stay or down.\n\nIf we stay, y_8=1, safe.\n\nOr down to y=0, safe.\n\nBut then at turn 9, similar issue.\n\nThe only way to be safe at turn 8 is to be on y=1 at turn 7, and stay at turn 8 to y_8=1.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 9, if we are on y=1, we can stay or go up to y=2 but unsafe, so we must stay to be safe, y_9=1.\n\nThen at turn 10, we can go up to y=2, safe, and so on.\n\nSo to summarize, we must be on y=1 at turn 8 and turn 9 to avoid collision during those turns.\n\nThat means we need to have y_8 =1 and y_9=1.\n\nThen from turn 10 onwards, we can go up each turn to reach y=9 at turn 18? Let's compute the turns.\n\nStart turn 0: y_0=0\n\nWe need to reach y=1 at some point, and be there at turn 8 and 9.\n\nTo minimize H, we should reach y=1 as soon as possible, but since we have to stay there for turn 8 and 9, we can arrive earlier and wait, or arrive exactly at turn 8.\n\nBut if we arrive at turn 8, y_8=1, then we stay at turn 9 to have y_9=1.\n\nThen from turn 10, go up each turn.\n\nBut we need to go from y=0 to y=1 first.\n\nSince y=1 is always safe, we can go to y=1 immediately at turn 1, then stay until turn 9, then go up.\n\nBut that means staying from turn 1 to turn 9 on y=1, which is 9 turns at y=1, but we start from turn 0.\n\nLet's list the actions.\n\nAt turn t, we perform action a_t to set y_{t+1}.\n\nTurn 0: position y_0=0\n\nApply a_0: if U, y_1=1; if S, y_1=0, etc.\n\nWe want y_8=1 and y_9=1.\n\ny_8=1 means that at turn 8, position is 1.\n\ny_8 is set after action a_7? Let's clarify.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo:\n\n- After a_0, y_1 is set\n\n- After a_1, y_2 is set\n\n- ...\n- After a_7, y_8 is set\n- After a_8, y_9 is set\n- After a_9, y_10 is set, etc.\n\ny_8 is the position at turn 8, which is set after action a_7.\n\nSimilarly, y_9 is set after a_8.\n\nWe need position at turn 8: y_8 =1\n\nPosition at turn 9: y_9 =1\n\nTo have y_8=1, that means after action a_7, y_8=1.\n\nSimilarly, y_9=1 after action a_8.\n\nNow, y_8=1 implies that at turn 7, after a_7, y_8=1.\n\nThe action a_7 is applied at turn 7, based on y_7.\n\nSimilarly, for y_9=1, after a_8 at turn 8, based on y_8.\n\nSince y_8=1, to have y_9=1, we need to apply S at turn 8, so a_8=S, then y_9=1.\n\nIf we apply U, y_9=2, not 1; D, y_9=0.\n\nSo to keep y_9=1, we must do S at turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, for y_8=1, it depends on previous.\n\nNow, we need to reach y_8=1 from start.\n\nFrom y_0=0, to have y_8=1, we must have done some actions.\n\nThe minimal actions to reach y=1 is one up move, but we can take longer.\n\nTo have y_8=1, we could have reached y=1 earlier and stayed, or arrived at turn 8.\n\nBut since we want to minimize the total turns to reach y=9, we should not stay longer than necessary.\n\nSo, we should arrive at y=1 exactly at turn 8, so that we don't waste turns staying before.\n\nSimilarly, then stay at turn 8 to remain at y=1 for turn 9.\n\nThen from turn 9 onwards, go up.\n\nSo:\n\n- From turn 0 to turn 7, we need to go from y=0 to y=1, but we need y_8=1.\n\ny_8=1 means at the start of turn 8, position is 1.\n\nWhich is set after a_7.\n\nSo after a_7, y_8=1.\n\nNow, to have that, we need to be at y_7 such that after S or U or D, but to get to y=1.\n\nIf at turn 7, y_7=1, then a_7=S, y_8=1\n\nOr y_7=0, a_7=U, y_8=1\n\nOr y_7=2, a_7=D, y_8=1\n\nBut we also need to consider the path to y_7.\n\nSince y=1 is safe, and we can be there, but other rows have constraints.\n\nIn this case, for turns before 8, we can go up freely except for the early unsafe times, but since we are going up slowly, at early turns we are on low rows, so no issue with T=2,3 for y=7,8.\n\nFor example, from turn 0 to turn 7, we need to reach a position where we can set y_8=1.\n\nTo minimize time, we should go up as much as possible, but we need to end up at y=1 at turn 8.\n\nSince we start at y=0, after 7 actions (from t=0 to t=6), we have y_7, then a_7 sets y_8.\n\ny_7 can be from 0 to 7, depending on actions.\n\nThen to have y_8=1, we can:\n\n- If y_7=1, a_7=S, y_8=1\n\n- If y_7=0, a_7=U, y_8=1\n\n- If y_7=2, a_7=D, y_8=1\n\n- If y_7= other, cannot reach y=8=1 in one step.\n\nSo y_7 must be 0,1, or 2.\n\nNow, to minimize the time to later reach y=9, we want y_7 as high as possible, so that from there we can go up faster after the wait.\n\nBut we have to wait at turn 8 and 9 on y=1, then go up.\n\nAfter y_9=1, we go up each turn to y_9 at turn 18? Let's calculate.\n\nFirst, we need to have y_8=1 and y_9=1.\n\nThen from turn 9, after a_9, we can set y_10, and so on.\n\nAfter a_9, y_10, etc.\n\nWe want y_K=9 for some K.\n\nAfter y_9=1, we need 8 more up moves to reach y=9, since from y=1 to y=9, 8 steps.\n\nEach up move increases y by 1.\n\nSo from y_9=1, after first U, y_10=2; ... after eighth U, y_17=9.\n\nSo at turn 17, y_17=9.\n\nH is the number of actions to reach y=9 at turn H.\n\nAfter H actions, y_H=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=H-1.\n\ny_H set after a_{H-1}.\n\nWe have y_9=1 after a_8.\n\nThen we apply a_9 to set y_10, ..., up to a_{16} to set y_17=9.\n\nSo actions from t=0 to t=16, that's 17 actions, H=17, y_17=9.\n\nBut we can reduce by not staying on y=1 too early.\n\nFor example, we can be on a higher row at turn 7, then go down to y=1 at turn 8.\n\nBut going down might take turns.\n\nFor instance, if at turn 7 we are on y=2, then a_7=D, y_8=1.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=1, a_7=S, y_8=1.\n\nIf on y=0, a_7=U, y_8=1.\n\nBut to be on y=0 at turn 7, we must have stayed low, which might not be efficient.\n\nSimilarly, y=2.\n\nNow, y=2 at turn 7 is safe, since unsafe only at T=8,9.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nSo to have y_7 as high as possible, we can be at y=7 at turn 7, for example, which is safe as before.\n\nThen from y_7=7, we can go down to y=6? But at turn 8, y=6 unsafe.\n\nWe need to get to y=1 at turn 8.\n\nFrom y=7 at turn 7, to reach y=1 at turn 8, we need to go down 6 steps in one turn, impossible.\n\ny can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nSo from y=7, we can only go to y=6,7, or 8 at next turn.\n\nNone of which is y=1.\n\nSo we cannot reach y=1 from y=7 in one turn.\n\nTherefore, to have y_8=1, we must have y_7 such that we can reach y=1 in one action, so y_7 must be 0,1, or 2.\n\nSimilarly, for earlier turns.\n\nSo the highest we can be at turn 7 is y=2.\n\nThen from y=2, at turn 7, we do D, so a_7=D, then y_8=1.\n\nThen at turn 8, we do S, a_8=S, so y_9=1.\n\nThen from turn 9, we start going up: a_9=U, y_10=2; a_10=U, y_11=3; ... up to a_16=U, y_17=9.\n\nNow, what about the path to reach y_7=2.\n\nFrom start, we can go up quickly to y=2.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 0: a_0=U, y_1=1\n\nTurn 1: a_1=U, y_2=2\n\nThen we need to be at y=2 at turn 7? y_7=2.\n\nBut from above, after turn 1, y_2=2.\n\nThen from turn 2 to turn 6, we can stay on y=2 or move, but to have y_7=2, we need to stay or adjust.\n\nSince y=2 is safe except at T=8,9, and turn 2 to 6 are safe, we can stay on y=2 from turn 2 to turn 6.\n\nThen at turn 7, we are at y=2, do D to y_8=1.\n\nThen turn 8, S to y_9=1.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut staying from turn 2 to turn 6 is inefficient; we can go higher during that time.\n\nFor example, from turn 2, y_2=2, we can go up to y=6 or 7 by turn 6 or 7.\n\nBut at turn 7, we need to be at y=0,1,2 to reach y=1 at turn 8.\n\nIf we go higher, we have to come down earlier.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to y=6 at turn 6.\n\ny_0=0\n\na_0=U, y_1=1\n\na_1=U, y_2=2\n\na_2=U, y_3=3\n\na_3=U, y_4=4\n\na_4=U, y_5=5\n\na_5=U, y_6=6\n\nNow at turn 6, y_6=6, which is safe since T=6 not 8 or 9.\n\nThen we need to get to y=1 by turn 8? But at turn 7, we apply a_6 to set y_7.\n\nFrom y_6=6, a_6 can be D, to y_7=5; or S, y_7=6; U, y_7=7.\n\nNone is 0,1,2 directly.\n\nThen y_7 could be 5,6,7.\n\nThen at turn 7, we apply a_7 to set y_8.\n\nIf y_7=5, a_7=D to y_8=4; S to 5; U to 6.\n\nNot 1.\n\nSimilarly, from y_7=6, y_8=5,6,7\n\ny_7=7, y_8=6,7,8\n\nNone can be 1.\n\nSo we cannot reach y_8=1 from y_6=6 in two steps? From y=6, to go to y=1, we need 5 down moves, but we have only two actions: a_6 and a_7.\n\nAfter a_6, y_7; after a_7, y_8.\n\nFrom y_6=6, after a_6, y_7 can be 5,6,7\n\nThen after a_7, from y_7=5, y_8=4,5,6; from y_7=6, y_8=5,6,7; etc. All between 4 and 8, not 1.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=1 from y=6 in two turns.\n\nSimilarly, if we are higher, worse.\n\nTherefore, to be able to reach y=1 at turn 8, we must be at y=0,1, or 2 at turn 7.\n\nAnd since we want to be high, best to be at y=2 at turn 7.\n\nThen from there, go down to y=1 at turn 8.\n\nNow, to reach y=2 at turn 7, we can do it with minimal actions.\n\nFor example, from start, we can go to y=2 by turn 2: a_0=U, y_1=1; a_1=U, y_2=2.\n\nThen from turn 2 to turn 6, we need to be at y=2 at turn 7? y_7=2.\n\ny_7 is position at turn 7, set after a_6.\n\nAfter a_6, y_7=2.\n\nSo at turn 6, we have y_6, then a_6 sets y_7.\n\nTo have y_7=2, we need y_6 such that a_6 can set y_7=2.\n\nSo y_6 must be 1,2, or 3.\n\nSimilarly, to be efficient, we can stay on y=2 or move around, but since other rows are safe except at T=8,9, we can go up and down, but going up might force us to come down, wasting moves.\n\nTo minimize time, we should not go above y=2 until after the wait, because if we go higher, we have to come down to y=2 for turn 7, which takes extra down moves.\n\nFor example, if we go to y=3 at some point, then later to come back to y=2, we need a down move, which doesn't progress.\n\nSo best to stay on y=2 from turn 2 to turn 6, then at turn 7, we are still on y=2, do nothing or whatever, but to set y_7=2, if we are on y=2 at turn 6, we can do S, y_7=2.\n\nThen a_7=D, y_8=1.\n\nThen a_8=S, y_9=1.\n\nThen from turn 9, go up.\n\nNow, let's list the actions and positions.\n\nTurn 0: y_0=0, apply a_0=U, so y_1=1\n\nTurn 1: y_1=1, apply a_1=U, so y_2=2\n\nTurn 2: y_2=2, apply a_2=S, so y_3=2 (stay)\n\nTurn 3: y_3=2, apply a_3=S, y_4=2\n\nTurn 4: y_4=2, apply a_4=S, y_5=2\n\nTurn 5: y_5=2, apply a_5=S, y_6=2\n\nTurn 6: y_6=2, apply a_6=S, y_7=2\n\nTurn 7: y_7=2, apply a_7=D, so y_8=1\n\nTurn 8: y_8=1, apply a_8=S, so y_9=1\n\nNow turn 9: y_9=1, apply a_9=U, so y_10=2\n\nTurn 10: y_10=2, apply a_10=U, y_11=3\n\nTurn 11: y_11=3, apply a_11=U, y_12=4\n\nTurn 12: y_12=4, apply a_12=U, y_13=5\n\nTurn 13: y_13=5, apply a_13=U, y_14=6\n\nTurn 14: y_14=6, apply a_14=U, y_15=7\n\nTurn 15: y_15=7, apply a_15=U, y_16=8\n\nTurn 16: y_16=8, apply a_16=U, y_17=9\n\nNow at turn 17, y_17=9, reached.\n\nWe need to check if there are any collisions during the path.\n\nFirst, at turn 0: y=0, safe\n\nTurn 1: y=1, freeway 1, always safe, ok\n\nTurn 2: y=2, freeway 2, unsafe only at T=8,9, T=2 not, safe\n\nSimilarly, turn 3: y=3, freeway 3, safe since T=3 not 8,9\n\nTurn 4: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\nTurn 5: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\nTurn 6: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nTurn 7: y=7, freeway 7, unsafe at T=2,3 and T=8,9. T=7 not in, so safe? T=7, is it unsafe? No, only 2,3,8,9, so safe.\n\nTurn 8: y=8? No, at turn 8, y_8=1, freeway 1, always safe, ok\n\nTurn 9: y_9=1, freeway 1, safe\n\nTurn 10: y=2, freeway 2, T=10>9, safe\n\nSimilarly, turn 11: y=3, safe\n\n...\n\nTurn 16: y=8, freeway 8, unsafe at T=2,3,8,9. T=16 not, so safe.\n\nTurn 17: y=9, safe.\n\nAll safe.\n\nH=17 turns? Actions from t=0 to t=16, that's 17 actions, and y_17=9.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nWe might be able to reduce by not staying on y=2 for so long.\n\nFor example, we can go to y=2 later.\n\nSince we need to be at y=2 at turn 7, we can arrive exactly at turn 7.\n\nFor instance, we can stay at y=0 or y=1 longer.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, but staying low might delay the ascent.\n\nFor example:\n\nSuppose we stay at y=0 for some turns.\n\nTurn 0: y=0, apply S, y_1=0\n\nThen we can stay until some point.\n\nBut to reach y=2 at turn 7, we need to have actions.\n\ny_7=2.\n\nSet after a_6.\n\nWe can have different paths.\n\nBut since we need to go from y=0 to y=2, it takes at least 2 up moves.\n\nThe actions before turn 6 can be used to go up or stay.\n\nBut to have y_7=2, and we want to minimize the total turns, but the waiting is necessary at turn 8 and 9, so by going to y=2 early and staying, we are not gaining; we are just waiting earlier.\n\nBut in terms of reaching y=9, it might be the same or worse.\n\nIn the above path, we reach y=9 at turn 17.\n\nIf we delay going up, for example:\n\nStay at y=0 for 5 turns: turn 0 to 4: apply S each time, so y_1=0, y_2=0, ..., y_5=0\n\nThen turn 5: apply U, y_6=1\n\nTurn 6: apply U, y_7=2\n\nThen turn 7: y_7=2, apply D? a_7=D, y_8=1\n\nTurn 8: y_8=1, S, y_9=1\n\nThen turn 9: U, y_10=2\n\n...\n\nUp to y_17=9 same as before, but we spent more time at y=0, so y_17=9 still, but we started later, so same H.\n\nTo reach y_7=2, if we go directly: a_0=U, y_1=1; a_1=U, y_2=2; then we are at y=2 at turn 2, but we need y_7=2, so we have to stay from turn 2 to 6, which is 5 turns staying, whereas if we stay at y=0, we can stay less, but no, from y=0 to y=2 takes two turns, so to be at y=2 at turn 7, if we start going up at turn 5: turn 5: from y_5=0, a_5=U, y_6=1; turn 6: a_6=U, y_7=2. Then we stayed at y=0 from turn 0 to 5? Turn 0: y_0=0, if we apply S from t=0 to t=4, then a_5=U, y_6=1; a_6=U, y_7=2.\n\nActions:\n\nt=0: S, y_1=0\n\nt=1: S, y_2=0\n\nt=2: S, y_3=0\n\nt=3: S, y_4=0\n\nt=4: S, y_5=0\n\nt=5: U, y_6=1\n\nt=6: U, y_7=2\n\nt=7: D, y_8=1\n\nt=8: S, y_9=1\n\nt=9: U, y_10=2\n\n...\n\nt=16: U, y_17=9 same as before.\n\nWe saved some actions? No, in this case, from t=0 to t=4, we applied 5 S actions, whereas in the first path, from t=2 to t=6, we applied S actions at t=2,3,4,5,6, that's 5 S actions, same number.\n\nIn first path: actions t=0:U, t=1:U, t=2:S, t=3:S, t=4:S, t=5:S, t=6:S, that's two U and five S to reach y_7=2.\n\nIn second: t=0:S, t=1:S, t=2:S, t=3:S, t=4:S, t=5:U, t=6:U, so five S and two U, same.\n\nThen t=7:D, t=8:S, t=9:U to t=16:U, y_17=9.\n\nSo H=17 in both cases.\n\nBut we can reduce by going higher before and coming down, but earlier we saw it might not help because coming down takes turns.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to y=7 at turn 7.\n\ny_0=0\n\na_0=U, y_1=1\n\na_1=U, y_2=2\n\na_2=U, y_3=3\n\na_3=U, y_4=4\n\na_4=U, y_5=5\n\na_5=U, y_6=6\n\na_6=U, y_7=7\n\nNow at turn 7, y_7=7, safe.\n\nBut we need to get to y=1 for turn 8, impossible in one step.\n\nWe need to start descending earlier.\n\nFor example, to be at y=2 at turn 7, but from above, at turn 7 we are at y=7.\n\nTo descend to y=2, we need 5 down moves, from turn 7 to turn 12 or something.\n\nBut turn 8 is coming.\n\nFor instance, at turn 7, y_7=7, apply D, y_8=6\n\nBut at turn 8, y=6, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we descend before, say at turn 6, from y_6=6, apply D, y_7=5\n\nThen at turn 7, y=5, apply D, y_8=4\n\nBut y=4 at turn 8 unsafe.\n\nStill not y=1.\n\nAnd we cannot reach y=1 by turn 8 from high position.\n\nSo the only way is to not go above y=2 until after turn 9.\n\nIn the path, we must be at y<=2 from turn 7 to turn 9 or something.\n\nBut specifically, we need y_8=1 and y_9=1.\n\nThen after that, we go up.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 faster, but from y=1 at turn 9, it takes 8 up moves to y=9 at turn 17.\n\nUnless we can be higher at turn 9, but at turn 9, we must be on y=1 to be safe, since if we are on y=9, we are done, but we can't reach by turn 9.\n\nSo y_9 must be 1.\n\nThus, minimal H is 17.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a way to reach earlier.\n\nAnother idea: since at turn 8 and 9, we must be on y=1, but what if we reach y=9 before turn 8? Impossible, as min turn 9.\n\nOr after, but same.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=0 at turn 8, but y=0 only if we go down, but from where?\n\nFor example, if we are on y=1 at turn 7, then at turn 7 apply D, y_8=0.\n\nThen at turn 8, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at turn 8, apply U, y_9=1? But at turn 9, y=1, safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut y_9=1, same as before.\n\nThen we need to reach y=1 by turn 7 to go down.\n\nBut y_7=1, then a_7=D, y_8=0; a_8=U, y_9=1.\n\nThen from y_9=1, go up to y_17=9, still H=17.\n\nIf we start from y_7=1, go down to y_8=0, then up to y_9=1, that takes two actions to stay at y=1 effectively, same as staying.\n\nNo gain.\n\nThus, minimal H is 17.\n\nBut in the action sequence, we have 17 actions.\n\nNow, back to freeway 7 and 8, we have unsafe at T=2,3, but in our path, at T=2 and 3, we are on y=2 or less, which is not y=7 or 8, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, all safe.\n\nPerhaps we can go up to y=6 or 7 after turn 1 or something, but we have to come down for turn 8, which costs turns.\n\nFor example, suppose we go to y=7 quickly by turn 7, but then we cannot avoid collision at turn 8 unless we are on y=1, which we can't.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nThus, the sequence above is fine.\n\nTo minimize the stay, we can go to y=2 at turn 7 directly.\n\nFor example, stay at y=0 until turn 5: a_0 to a_4: S, so y_1=0, y_2=0, y_3=0, y_4=0, y_5=0\n\nThen a_5=U, y_6=1\n\na_6=U, y_7=2\n\nThen a_7=D, y_8=1\n\na_8=S, y_9=1\n\nThen a_9=U, y_10=2\n\n...\n\na_16=U, y_17=9\n\nSame H.\n\nIn this case, actions: t=0 to t=4: S (5 actions), t=5:U, t=6:U, t=7:D, t=8:S, t=9:U, t=10:U, ..., t=16:U\n\nt=9 to t=16: 8 U actions to go from y=1 to y=9.\n\ny_9=1, a_9=U to y_10=2, ..., a_16=U to y_17=9, so 8 U from t=9 to t=16.\n\nTotal actions: t=0 to t=16, 17 actions.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the task, it says \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn the sequence, we have to start from t_1, which is 0.\n\nIn the sequence above, with going up early and staying.\n\nBut we can choose any, as long as H minimal.\n\nNow, another thing: in freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but we handled the unsafe times.\n\nIn the beginning, freeway 1 has no issue.\n\nBut in our path, when we go up later, from turn 10 to 16, we pass through y=7 and y=8 at T=15 and 16, which are safe.\n\nT=15 and 16, not 2,3 or 8,9, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier by not waiting on y=1 but going directly after T=9.\n\nBut we have to avoid T=8 and T=9 on middle rows.\n\nSince at T=8, we must be on y=1, and at T=9 on y=1 or 9.\n\nBut y=9 not possible, so y=1.\n\nThus, no choice.\n\nSo H=17 is minimal.\n\nNow for the sequence, let's write one.\n\nFor example:\n\nStart at t=0, y=0\n\nApply U, to y=1\n\nThen U to y=2\n\nThen stay S for 5 turns (t=2 to t=6) to remain at y=2\n\nThen at t=7, D to y=1\n\nt=8, S to stay y=1\n\nt=9, U to y=2\n\nThen U each turn to y=9 at t=17.\n\nIn terms of actions:\n\nTurn t_1 (0): U\n\nTurn t_1+1 (1): U\n\nTurn t_1+2 (2): S\n\nTurn t_1+3 (3): S\n\nTurn t_1+4 (4): S\n\nTurn t_1+5 (5): S\n\nTurn t_1+6 (6): S\n\nTurn t_1+7 (7): D\n\nTurn t_1+8 (8): S\n\nTurn t_1+9 (9): U\n\nTurn t_1+10 (10): U\n\nTurn t_1+11 (11): U\n\nTurn t_1+12 (12): U\n\nTurn t_1+13 (13): U\n\nTurn t_1+14 (14): U\n\nTurn t_1+15 (15): U\n\nTurn t_1+16 (16): U\n\nAfter last action at t=16, y_17=9.\n\nH=17 turns? H is the number of actions, from t=0 to t=16, that's 17 actions.\n\nThe sequence has 17 actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be from Turn t_1 to Turn t_1 + H-1.\n\nt_1=0, H=17, so actions from t=0 to t=16.\n\nNow, in the sequence, at turn 7 we do D, but we could avoid D by being at y=1 or 0.\n\nBut if we are at y=1 at turn 7, then a_7=S, y_8=1; or if y=0, a_7=U, y_8=1.\n\nIn the above, we were at y=2, so we did D.\n\nBut if we are at y=1 at turn 7, we can do S to stay.\n\nFor example:\n\nGo to y=1 at turn 1: a_0=U, y_1=1\n\nThen stay on y=1 from turn 1 to turn 8? But at turn 8, we need y_8=1, which can be.\n\ny_1=1, then apply S each turn until turn 8.\n\nAfter a_7, y_8=1; after a_8, y_9=1 if S.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nt=0: a_0=U, y_1=1\n\nt=1: y_1=1, a_1=S, y_2=1\n\nt=2: a_2=S, y_3=1\n\n...\n\nup to t=7: a_7=S, y_8=1\n\nt=8: a_8=S, y_9=1\n\nThen t=9: a_9=U, y_10=2\n\n...\n\nt=16: a_16=U, y_17=9\n\nSame as before, but we stayed on y=1 from turn 1 to 9, which is longer stay, but H same.\n\nIn this case, from t=1 to t=8, we applied S at each, so 8 S actions to stay, whereas in previous, we had some time at y=2.\n\nBut total actions still 17.\n\nTo have less stay, we can go to y=1 later.\n\nFor example, stay at y=0 until turn 6.\n\nt=0: S, y_1=0\n\nt=1: S, y_2=0\n\n...\n\nt=5: S, y_6=0\n\nt=6: U, y_7=1\n\nt=7: S, y_8=1 (since we need y_8=1, and y_7=1, so S)\n\nt=8: S, y_9=1\n\nt=9: U, y_10=2\n\n...\n\nt=16: U, y_17=9\n\nNow, actions: t=0 to t=5: S (6 actions), t=6:U, t=7:S, t=8:S, t=9:U to t=16:U (8 U)\n\nt=9 to t=16: 8 U, but t=9:U to y_10=2? y_9=1, a_9=U, y_10=2; ... a_16=U, y_17=9.\n\nSo actions t=0 to t=16: 17 actions.\n\nCompared to first sequence where we had only 5 S during early, here 6 S, but same H.\n\nIn the first sequence with y=2, we had two U, five S, one D, then after etc.\n\nBut D is like a wasted move, but in terms of progress, it doesn't matter.\n\nSo all have H=17.\n\nNow for the answer, I think any sequence with H=17 is fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to output the actions.\n\nAlso, in the car states, freeway 7 and 8 have cars that are unsafe at T=2,3, but since we are not on y=7 or 8 at that time, no issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nBut is there a way with H less than 17?\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=9 at turn 9, but impossible.\n\nOr at turn 10, but to reach y=9 at turn 10, we need to have y_10=9.\n\ny_10 set after a_9.\n\nTo have that, from start, we need 10 actions? y_0=0, after 9 U, y_9=9, at turn 9.\n\ny_10=9 only if we stay at y=9.\n\nBut at turn 9, if y_9=9, we are done, no need for turn 10.\n\nThe target is to reach (0,9), which is position at some turn.\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nt1=0, so y_H =9.\n\nFor H=9, y_9=9 possible only if we go up all the time, but at turn 8, y_8=8, which is unsafe, so we cannot, because collision at turn 8.\n\nIf we can avoid being on y=8 at turn 8, but in all-up, we are.\n\nSuppose we go up slower or faster, but we can't go faster.\n\nSlower: for example, stay at some point to shift time.\n\nBut at turn 8, wherever we are on y=2-8, it is unsafe.\n\nExcept if we are on y=1.\n\nBut to be on y=1 at turn 8, and we need to reach y=9, it will take more turns.\n\nFor example, if at turn 8 we are on y=1, then we need 8 more up moves to y=9 at turn 16? y_8=1, then after a_8, y_9; to y_9=9, impossible in one step.\n\ny_9=2 if U, etc.\n\nSo y_16=9 after 16 actions? y_8=1, after k actions, y_{8+k}.\n\nTo y_{8+k}=9, since from y=1, need to increase by 8, so k=8, y_{16}=9.\n\nH=16 actions? Actions from t=0 to t=15, y_{16}=9.\n\nIf we can have y_8=1, then after actions a_8 to a_15, 8 actions, y_16=9.\n\nNow, to have y_8=1, we need to reach that with actions from t=0 to t=7.\n\ny_8 set after a_7.\n\nTo have y_8=1, with minimal actions from start.\n\nFrom y_0=0 to y_8=1, we can do it with 1 up and some stays, but at least one up.\n\nFor example, a_0=U, then a_1 to a_7 all S, so y_1=1, y_2=1, ..., y_8=1.\n\nThen a_8=U, y_9=2? But we need to go up later.\n\ny_8=1, then a_8=U, y_9=2; a_9=U, y_10=3; ... a_15=U, y_16=9.\n\nNow H=16 actions? Actions from t=0 to t=15.\n\nt=0: a_0=U, y_1=1\n\nt=1: a_1=S, y_2=1\n\n...\n\nt=7: a_7=S, y_8=1\n\nt=8: a_8=U, y_9=2\n\nt=9: a_9=U, y_10=3\n\nt=10: a_10=U, y_11=4\n\nt=11: a_11=U, y_12=5\n\nt=12: a_12=U, y_13=6\n\nt=13: a_13=U, y_14=7\n\nt=14: a_14=U, y_15=8\n\nt=15: a_15=U, y_16=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nTurn 0: y=0, safe\n\nTurn 1: y=1, safe\n\n...\n\nTurn 7: y=1, safe\n\nTurn 8: y=1, safe\n\nTurn 9: y=2, freeway 2, T=9, unsafe! Oh, at turn 9, y=2, which is unsafe since T=9 is unsafe for y=2.\n\nCollision at turn 9.\n\nI forgot that.\n\nAt turn 9, y=2, and T=9, which is unsafe for y=2.\n\nSimilarly, in this sequence, at turn 9, y_9=2, unsafe.\n\nMistake.\n\nTo avoid, at turn 9, we must not be on y=2-8.\n\nBut in this path, we are on y=2 at turn 9.\n\nIf we stay on y=1 at turn 8, but we did U to go to y=2.\n\nBut at turn 8, if we stay, y_9=1, safe, but then we are not progressing.\n\nThen later go up.\n\nBut same as before.\n\nIn the sequence above, to avoid collision at turn 9, we need to be on y=1 or 9 at turn 9.\n\nBut y_9=2, not good.\n\nSo we must have y_9=1 or 9.\n\nIn this case, with y_8=1, we can set a_8=S, so y_9=1, safe.\n\nThen at turn 9, y=1, apply U to y_10=2, and so on, to y_17=9.\n\nH=17 again.\n\nThus, minimal H is 17.\n\nSo for the answer, we can use one of the sequences.\n\nNow, in the output, we need to list the actions.\n\nAlso, for freeway 7 and 8, in our path, when we go up later, at T=15, y=7, which is freeway 7, T=15, not unsafe, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, to write the sequence.\n\nLet me choose the first one I thought.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 7 is D, which might be odd, but it works.\n\nWe can avoid D by being at y=1 at turn 7.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 0: U  // y1=1\n\nTurn 1: S  // y2=1\n\nTurn 2: S  // y3=1\n\n...\n\nTurn 7: S  // y8=1\n\nTurn 8: S  // y9=1\n\nTurn 9: U  // y10=2\n\nTurn 10: U  // y11=3\n\n...\n\nTurn 16: U  // y17=9\n\nBut here from turn 1 to turn 8, we are staying, many S.\n\nIn the sequence, actions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nNow, at turn 9: y=2, T=9, but T=9, y=2, unsafe? Turn 9 position y_9=1, set after a_8.\n\nAfter a_8=S, y_9=1.\n\nThen at turn 9, y=1, safe.\n\nThen a_9=U, sets y_10=2, but turn 10 position is y_10=2.\n\nAt turn 10, T=10, y=2, safe since T=10 not 8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nAnd H=17 same.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nFor the answer, I'll use the first one to have less S in the beginning.\n\nBut in the first, we have D, which might not be necessary.\n\nSince the problem allows, but D is fine.\n\nTo avoid D, we can be at y=1 at turn 7.\n\nFor example, go to y=1 at turn 1, then stay until turn 8.\n\nAs above.\n\nIn the sequence with D, we had y=2 for some time.\n\nBut for output, let's use a sequence without D.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t1: U  (t1=0)\n\nTurn t1+1: U\n\nBut t1+1 is turn 1, etc.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U  // now y=2 at turn 2? Positions: after a0=U, y1=1; after a1=U, y2=2.\n\nThen to stay, but in the no-D version.\n\nUse:\n\nTurn 0: U  // to y1=1\n\nThen for turn 1 to turn 7: all S, so y2=1 to y8=1\n\nTurn 1: S, y2=1\n\nTurn 2: S, y3=1\n\n...\n\nTurn 7: S, y8=1\n\nThen turn 8: S, y9=1\n\nThen turn 9: U, y10=2\n\n...\n\nTurn 16: U, y17=9\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S  // this sets y8=1\n\nTurn 8: S  // sets y9=1\n\nTurn 9: U  // sets y10=2\n\nTurn 10: U  // y11=3\n\nTurn 11: U  // y12=4\n\nTurn 12: U  // y13=5\n\nTurn 13: U  // y14=6\n\nTurn 14: U  // y15=7\n\nTurn 15: U  // y16=8\n\nTurn 16: U  // y17=9\n\nNow, H=17.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nAlso, for the car, in freeway 7 and 8, at T=2 and 3, we are on y=1, not affected.\n\nSo I think this is acceptable.\n\nThe minimal H is 17.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) is 17. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is on a safe row at critical times, particularly at turns 8 and 9 when all freeways from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are unsafe due to cars covering position \\(x = 0\\).\n\n- At turn 8 and turn 9, the player must be on \\(y = 1\\) (which is always safe) to avoid collision, as all other freeways (\\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 8\\)) are unsafe at these times.\n- The sequence reaches \\(y = 1\\) by turn 1 and stays there until turn 9 to satisfy this condition.\n- After turn 9, the player moves up one row per turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- **Turn 0**: Move up (U) to reach \\(y = 1\\) at turn 1.\n- **Turns 1 to 8**: Stay (S) to remain on \\(y = 1\\), ensuring safety at turns 8 and 9.\n- **Turns 9 to 16**: Move up (U) each turn to increase \\(y\\) from 2 to 9, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17.\n\nThis sequence is collision-free:\n- Turns 0: \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway).\n- Turns 1 to 9: \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1 is always safe).\n- Turns 10 to 16: \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are safe because turns 10-16 avoid the unsafe times (T=2,3 and T=8,9 for relevant freeways).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move on their freeways, and I only collide if I'm on a freeway where a car spans x=0 at that turn. Importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new row until the next turn, so I only check for collisions on the row I'm currently on.\n\nThe current turn is t1 = 2, and I'm at y=1. I need to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, I should figure out where the cars are at each future turn to avoid them.\n\nCars move left or right with constant speed. For left-moving cars, the span moves left, so h and tau decrease by s per turn. For right-moving, they increase by s per turn.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nHead is -48, tail is -59? That seems odd because usually head is the front, so for right-moving, head should be greater than tail. But here it says (-48, -59, right, 12). -48 is greater than -59? -48 is to the right of -59 since numbers increase to the right, I assume.\n\nIn terms of x-coordinate, larger x is right, smaller x is left.\n\nSo for a right-moving car, head should have higher x than tail.\n\nHere, head = -48, tail = -59, and -48 > -59, so head is at x=-48, tail at x=-59, and since it's moving right, that makes sense because -48 is right of -59.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nFreeway 1 has one car: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFreeways 2 to 6 each have one car: (-36, -47, right, 6) each.\n\nFreeway 7 has three cars: (-36, -47, right, 6), (0, -11, right, 6), (36, 25, right, 6)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 has the same: (-36, -47, right, 6), (0, -11, right, 6), (36, 25, right, 6)\n\nNow, I need to find when these cars have spans that include x=0, because that's when collision happens if I'm on that row.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, for a car on freeway y_T, 0 is in Span(T).\n\nSpan(T) for a car is [head(T), tail(T)] for left-moving, or [tail(T), head(T)] for right-moving? The notation in the problem is a bit messy.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nIt says [h, τ], but if it's left-moving, and h is head, τ is tail, then if moving left, head should be left of tail? I think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor freeway 1: head = -48, tail = -59, direction right, speed 12.\n\nSince direction right, head should be the front, so at higher x. -48 > -59, so head at -48, tail at -59, so the car occupies from x=-59 to x=-48? But that's only 11 units, but speed is 12, which is fine, just size.\n\nThe span is from tail to head, I think. But in the update, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nLet's see the problem:\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nBut [h, τ] with h and τ, if h is head and moving left, head might be left, so h < τ, so [h, τ] could be from smaller to larger if we assume interval notation.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nHere it explicitly says [τ, h] for right-moving, so tail first, then head, so for right-moving, tail at left, head at right.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (head, tail) = (-48, -59), but for right-moving, head should be right, so -48 is right, tail -59 left, so the car is from x=-59 to x=-48.\n\nIn the span notation for right-moving, it's [τ, h] = [-59, -48], which is from left to right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] with h left, τ right.\n\nBut in this problem, all cars seem to be right-moving, from the given states.\n\nFreeway 1: direction right\n\nFreeways 2-8 all right-moving.\n\nNo left-moving cars here.\n\nSo for all cars, they are right-moving, so at time t1=2, for each car, span is [tail, head] with tail < head.\n\nAnd at time T, span is [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\nCollision on freeway k at turn T if y_T = k and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose action to go to y_{T+1}, but during turn T, I am on y_T, so I collide if on that row, 0 is in some car's span at turn T.\n\nThen after move, I am on new row for next turn.\n\nNow, t1=2, I am at y=1.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nSince I start at y=1, and need to go to y=9, and I can only change y by at most 1 per turn, minimum turns is 8, if I go up every turn. But I might have to avoid cars, so it could take more turns if I need to wait or go down sometimes.\n\nBut going down might not help since I need to reach 9, so probably I should go up as much as possible, but avoid rows when cars are at x=0.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when cars are at x=0.\n\nStart with freeway 1: only one car, tail=-59, head=-48, speed=12, right-moving.\n\nAt time T, tail position: -59 + 12*(T-2)\n\nHead position: -48 + 12*(T-2)\n\n0 is in span if tail <= 0 <= head, so -59 +12(T-2) <= 0 <= -48 +12(T-2)\n\nSolve:\n\n-59 +12(T-2) <= 0 => 12(T-2) <= 59 => T-2 <= 59/12 = 4.916, so T <= 6.916, since T integer, T <=6\n\nAnd 0 <= -48 +12(T-2) => 48 <= 12(T-2) => 4 <= T-2 => T >=6\n\nSo T >=6 and T<=6, so only at T=6, 0 is in span.\n\nAt T=6: tail = -59 +12*(4) = -59 +48 = -11\n\nHead = -48 +12*4 = -48+48=0\n\nSo span from -11 to 0, so 0 is included, yes.\n\nAt T=5: tail = -59 +12*3 = -59+36= -23, head=-48+36= -12, both negative, 0 not in [-23,-12]\n\nAt T=7: tail= -59+12*5= -59+60=1, head= -48+60=12, span [1,12], 0 not included.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision at T=6 only.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car, tail=-47, head=-36, speed=6, right-moving.\n\nAt T, tail = -47 +6*(T-2)\n\nHead = -36 +6*(T-2)\n\n0 in span if -47 +6(T-2) <=0 <= -36 +6(T-2)\n\nFirst, -47 +6(T-2) <=0 => 6(T-2) <=47 => T-2 <=47/6≈7.833, T<=9.833, T<=9\n\nSecond, 0 <= -36 +6(T-2) => 36 <=6(T-2) => 6 <= T-2 => T>=8\n\nSo T>=8 and T<=9? T=8 or 9.\n\nT=8: tail= -47 +6*6 = -47+36= -11, head= -36+36=0, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=9: tail= -47+6*7= -47+42= -5, head= -36+42=6, span [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nT=7: tail= -47+6*5= -47+30= -17, head= -36+30= -6, span [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nT=10: tail= -47+42= -5? Wait T=10: T-2=8, tail=-47+48=1, head=-36+48=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo collision at T=8 and T=9 for freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, car (-36,-47,right,6) tail=-47,head=-36,speed=6, so same as above, collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway 4: same, collision T=8,9\n\nFreeway 5: same, T=8,9\n\nFreeway 6: same, T=8,9\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,6) same as above, so will have collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6) head=0, tail=-11, direction right, speed 6.\n\nAt t1=2, span [tail, head] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt time T, tail = -11 +6*(T-2)\n\nHead = 0 +6*(T-2) =6(T-2)\n\n0 in span if tail <=0 <= head\n\n-11 +6(T-2) <=0 and 0 <= 6(T-2)\n\nFirst, 0 <= 6(T-2) always true for T>2, since T-2>=1 for T>=3, 6*1=6>0.\n\nBut T starts from current turn, T=2,3,...\n\nAt T=2, head=0, so 0 is included? Let's see.\n\nAt T, tail = -11 +6(T-2), head=6(T-2)\n\n0 in span if min(tail,head) <=0 <= max(tail,head), but since tail < head, it's tail <=0 <= head.\n\nSo -11 +6(T-2) <=0 <= 6(T-2)\n\nNow, 0 <= 6(T-2) implies T-2 >=0, so T>=2\n\nAnd -11 +6(T-2) <=0 => 6(T-2) <=11 => T-2 <=11/6≈1.833, so T<=3.833, T<=3\n\nSo T>=2 and T<=3, so T=2 or 3.\n\nAt T=2: tail=-11 +6(0) = -11? T-2=0 when T=2, so tail=-11 +0= -11, head=0, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt T=3: tail=-11 +6(1)= -11+6= -5, head=6(1)=6, span [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nAt T=4: tail=-11+6(2)= -11+12=1, head=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for second car on freeway 7, collision at T=2 and T=3.\n\nThird car on freeway 7: (36,25,right,6) head=36, tail=25, direction right.\n\nTail=25, head=36? 25<36, so [25,36] at t1=2.\n\nAt T, tail=25 +6(T-2), head=36+6(T-2)\n\n0 in span? tail=25 +6(T-2) >=25 >0 for T>=2, so always positive, 0 not in span ever. Min is 25 at T=2, up to larger, so 0 never in [tail,head] since tail>0.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 8, same cars.\n\nNow freeway 8: same as freeway 7? No, freeway 7 has three cars, freeway 8 also has the same three: (-36,-47,right,6), (0,-11,right,6), (36,25,right,6)\n\nSo for freeway 8, first car: same as freeway 2, collision at T=8,9\n\nSecond car: same as above, collision at T=2,3\n\nThird car: no collision.\n\nNow, also, I need to consider that I start at turn t1=2, position y=1.\n\nAt turn T, I am on row y_T.\n\nFor collision, I care about when I am on a row, and at that turn, a car on that row has span including 0.\n\nNow, let's list for each row, the turns when it is dangerous, i.e., collision possible.\n\nSince cars are only on y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so always safe.\n\ny=9 is the goal, no cars, so when I reach y=9, it's safe.\n\ny=0 might be safe, but I start from y=1, and need to go to y=9, so probably won't go to y=0 unless necessary, but I can if I want.\n\ny=0 is allowed, and no cars, so safe.\n\nBut since I need to go up, probably not efficient to go down.\n\nNow, I am at turn 2, y=1.\n\nFirst, on freeway y=1, is there a car? Freeway 1 has a car.\n\nAt turn T=2, on y=1, is there collision?\n\nFor freeway 1, we have car, and at T=2, what is span?\n\nt1=2, so for freeway 1 car: tail=-59, head=-48, speed=12.\n\nAt T=2, tail=-59, head=-48, span [-59,-48], 0 not in, so no collision at T=2 on y=1.\n\nEarlier we saw collision only at T=6 for y=1.\n\nBut y=1 has only one car, and at T=2, no collision, so I am safe at start.\n\nNow, I need to move to y=9.\n\nSince min steps is 8, let's see if I can go up every turn from turn 2 to turn 9, reaching y=9 at turn 10? Let's see the turns.\n\nStart at turn 2, y=1.\n\nAfter action at turn 2, I move to y_{3} = y2 + Δy, depending on a2.\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t.\n\nAt turn t, I choose action a_t, which determines Δy_t, and y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t, I am on y_t, and I collide if on row y_t, 0 is in some car span at turn t.\n\nThen for turn t+1, I am on y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nSo for example, at turn 2, I am on y2=1.\n\nI choose a2, which sets y3 = y2 + Δy.\n\nThen at turn 3, I am on y3, and so on.\n\nI need to reach y_T =9 for some T.\n\nThe sequence of actions from turn t1=2 to turn t1+H-1, and after H-1 actions, I am at y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nStart at turn 2, after 0 actions, position y2.\n\nAfter one action at turn 2, position y3.\n\nAfter k actions, position at turn 2+k.\n\nI reach y=9 at some turn T, meaning at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nAnd T = 2 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t1=2, position y_{t1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, position y_{t1+1}.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + t}, position y_{t1 + t +1}? No.\n\nThe action at time t affects the position at time t+1.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nChoose action a_t, which causes y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAt time t, we check collision based on y_t and cars at time t.\n\nWe want to find actions from t=2 to t=2+H-1 such that after H actions? No.\n\nThe sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt1=2, so actions a_{2 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor t=0, action a_{2+0} = a2, applied at turn 2, which sets y3.\n\nAfter applying a_{2 + t} at turn (2+t), we get y_{3+t}.\n\nThe position after all actions is at turn (2 + H).\n\nBecause: start at turn 2, y2.\n\nAfter a2 at turn 2, y3.\n\nAfter a3 at turn 3, y4.\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{2+H-1} at turn (2+H-1), y_{2+H}.\n\nWe want y_{2+H} =9.\n\nAnd we need min H such that we can reach without collision during turns t=2 to t=2+H-1? Collision is checked at each turn when we are on y_t.\n\nFrom turn 2 to turn (2+H-1), we are on positions from y2 to y_{2+H-1}, and at each of these turns, we must not collide.\n\nAt turn (2+H), when we are at y_{2+H}=9, we don't care about collision because y=9 has no cars, and we have reached.\n\nThe collision check is only when on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nSo for turns from 2 to (2+H-1), we are on some y between 0 and 9, and if y between 1 and 8, we need no car collision on that row at that turn.\n\nAt turn (2+H), we are at y=9, safe.\n\nSo the turns we care about for collision are t from 2 to (2+H-1).\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nI need to go from y=1 at t=2 to y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nIdeal: go up every turn, so in 8 moves: from t=2 to t=9, positions:\n\nt=2: y=1\n\na2=U, y3=2\n\na3=U, y4=3\n\n...\n\na8=U, y9=8\n\na9=U, y10=9\n\nSo at turn 10, y10=9, reached.\n\nH such that after H actions, y_{2+H}=9.\n\ny_{2+H}=9.\n\nAfter 0 actions, y2=1\n\nAfter 1 action, y3\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, y_{2+k}\n\nSet y_{2+k} =9, so k=7, since y2=1, to y9=9, need 7 up moves? y2=1, y3=2, ..., y9=8, y10=9, so from y2 to y10, that's 8 steps up? Positions: at turn 2, y=1; turn 3, y=2; ... turn 9, y=8; turn 10, y=9. So to reach y=9 at turn 10, we need 8 actions: from a2 to a9.\n\nH actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, so for t1=2, actions a2 to a_{2+H-1}, and y_{2+H} =9.\n\nSo for y_{2+H}=9, with y2=1, we need to increase y by 8, so min H=8 if all up.\n\ny_{2+H} = y2 + sum of Δy from t=2 to t=2+H-1.\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, sum must be +8 to go from 1 to 9.\n\nMin H when all Δy=1, so H=8.\n\nWith H=8 actions: a2 to a9, y10=9.\n\nNow, during turns t=2 to t=9, we are on y_t for t=2 to 9.\n\ny_t from 1 to 8 for t=2 to 9, since y2=1, y3=2, ..., y9=8.\n\nThen at t=10, y10=9, safe.\n\nNow, for t=2 to 9, we are on rows y=1 to 8, which have cars, so we need to ensure that at each turn, on that row, no collision.\n\nNow, let's list for each turn and each row, if collision happens.\n\nFirst, row y=1: only at T=6, as we found.\n\nSo at turn T, if on y=1, collision only if T=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=2: freeway 2, collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\ny=3: freeway 3, same as y=2, collision at T=8,9\n\ny=4: freeway 4, same, T=8,9\n\ny=5: freeway 5, same, T=8,9\n\ny=6: freeway 6, same, T=8,9\n\ny=7: freeway 7, has multiple cars.\n\nCollision times: first car, same as above, T=8,9\n\nSecond car, T=2,3\n\nThird car, no collision.\n\nSo overall, for y=7, collision at T=2,3 and T=8,9.\n\nT=2,3 from second car, T=8,9 from first car.\n\ny=8: similar, collision at T=2,3 (from second car) and T=8,9 (from first car)\n\nNow, in the direct path:\n\nAt turn t=2: y=1, row 1. Collision only at T=6, so at t=2, no collision, safe.\n\nt=3: y=2? In the path, if I go up each turn, at t=3, I would be on y=2.\n\nBut row y=2, collision at T=8 and 9, t=3 is not 8 or 9, so no collision at t=3 on y=2.\n\nSimilarly, t=4: y=3, row 3, collision only at T=8,9, t=4 not, safe.\n\nt=5: y=4, same, safe.\n\nt=6: y=5? t=6, y=5, row 5, collision at T=8,9, t=6 not, so safe? But row y=1 has collision at t=6, but I am on y=5 at t=6, not on y=1.\n\nIn this path: t=2: y=1\n\nt=3: y=2\n\nt=4: y=3\n\nt=5: y=4\n\nt=6: y=5\n\nt=7: y=6\n\nt=8: y=7\n\nt=9: y=8\n\nNow, at t=6, y=5, row 5: freeway 5, collision only at T=8,9, so at t=6, no collision. Safe.\n\nt=7: y=6, row 6, same, collision at T=8,9, t=7 not, safe.\n\nt=8: y=7, row 7, collision at T=2,3 and T=8,9. t=8 is T=8, so collision! On row 7 at t=8, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nSimilarly, t=9: y=8, row 8, collision at T=8,9? Row 8, collision at T=2,3 and T=8,9, so at t=9, collision as well.\n\nt=8 and t=9 both have collision on rows 7 and 8 respectively.\n\nSpecifically, at t=8, on y=7, collision because freeway 7 has car at x=0 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, t=9, on y=8, collision.\n\nSo in direct path, at t=8 and t=9, collision occurs.\n\nTherefore, I cannot go directly up without stopping or something.\n\nI need to avoid being on row 7 at t=8 or t=9, and row 8 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nSince row 7 and 8 have collision at t=8 and t=9.\n\nAlso, row 6 has collision at t=8 and t=9, but in the path, at t=8 I am on y=7, not y=6.\n\nBut if I can delay or something.\n\nPerhaps I need to wait at some row to avoid those times.\n\nFor example, if I stay at a safe row during t=8 and t=9.\n\nBut rows 1 to 6 all have possible collision times, but not at all times.\n\nSpecifically, row 1: dangerous only at t=6\n\nRow 2: dangerous at t=8,9\n\nSimilarly 3,4,5,6 all dangerous at t=8,9\n\nRow 7: dangerous at t=2,3,8,9\n\nRow 8: dangerous at t=2,3,8,9\n\nNow, for row 7, dangerous at t=2,3, but at t=2 I am on y=1, not y=7, so not on it at dangerous time except t=8,9.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 at t=2,3 I am not on it.\n\nBut in the critical times t=8 and t=9, all rows from 2 to 8 are dangerous? No.\n\nRow 2: dangerous at t=8,9\n\nRow 3: same\n\n...\n\nUp to row 6: dangerous at t=8,9\n\nRow 7: dangerous at t=8,9\n\nRow 8: dangerous at t=8,9\n\nWhat about row 1? Dangerous only at t=6.\n\nAt t=8 and t=9, row 1 is safe, because only dangerous at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, row 0 and row 9 are always safe, but row 0 is below.\n\ny=0 is safe, no cars.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nAt t=8 and t=9, the only safe rows are y=0, y=1, and y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, but I might not be there yet.\n\ny=1 is safe at t=8,9.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nBut I need to be on some row during t=8 and t=9 without collision.\n\nIf I can be on y=1 or y=0 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 might be far.\n\nSince I start from y=1, and need to go to y=9, I could go down to y=0 or stay low to avoid the danger times.\n\nBut t=8 and t=9 are late, so I might want to reach before or after.\n\nFirst, let's see the earliest I can reach.\n\nMin H=8, but with collision, so not possible.\n\nNext, H=9: with 9 actions, I can reach y=9 at turn 11? Let's see.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{2+H}=9.\n\nWith H=8, y10=9\n\nWith H=9, y11=9\n\nBut I can reach earlier? With H=8, y10=9, but collision during the path.\n\nWith more actions, I can take detour or wait.\n\nBut min H, so I need the smallest H such that I can avoid collision.\n\nWith H=8, I must be on y=7 at t=8 and y=8 at t=9, both dangerous, and I cannot avoid because I need to pass through.\n\nBut at t=8, I am on y=7, which is dangerous, but if I could be on a different row, but in the direct path I have to be there.\n\nBut I can choose different actions, so I might be on different rows at different times.\n\nFor example, at t=8, instead of being on y=7, I could be on y=6 or y=8, but both are dangerous at t=8.\n\ny=6: row 6, dangerous at t=8,9\n\ny=8: row 8, dangerous at t=8,9\n\ny=7 also dangerous.\n\nAll y=2 to 8 dangerous at t=8,9.\n\ny=1 safe at t=8,9.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nSo at t=8 and t=9, the only safe positions are y=0,1,9.\n\nSince I need to reach y=9, I could be at y=9 by t=8 or earlier, but min time to reach y=9 from y=1 is 8 turns, at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, y=9, safe.\n\nBut during t=8 and t=9, I need to be on safe rows.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=1 at t=8 and t=9, but y=1 is row 1, which is safe at t=8,9.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9 eventually.\n\nSo one idea: go up slowly or stay at low rows until after t=9.\n\nFor example, stay at y=1 for some turns.\n\nBut at t=6, y=1 is dangerous, so I cannot be on y=1 at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, other constraints.\n\nList the dangerous times for each row:\n\nRow 1: dangerous only at t=6\n\nRow 2: dangerous at t=8,9\n\nRow 3: t=8,9\n\nRow 4: t=8,9\n\nRow 5: t=8,9\n\nRow 6: t=8,9\n\nRow 7: dangerous at t=2,3,8,9\n\nBut t=2,3 are early, I am not on row 7 then, so only t=8,9 matter for us.\n\nSimilarly row 8: dangerous at t=2,3,8,9, only t=8,9 matter.\n\nSo effectively, for rows 2 to 8, all are dangerous at t=8 and t=9.\n\nRow 1 is dangerous only at t=6.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nTo avoid collision at t=8 and t=9, I must be on y=0, y=1, or y=9 at those turns.\n\nBut y=9 at t=8 or t=9 might be possible only if I reach early.\n\nEarliest to reach y=9 is at t=10 with 8 up moves.\n\nAt t=10, y=9, safe.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, where am I?\n\nWith min moves, at t=8, I would be at y=7 or something, but dangerous.\n\nSince I need to be at safe position at t=8 and t=9, let's consider the position at those times.\n\nFirst, at t=8, I must be on y=0,1, or 9.\n\nSimilarly at t=9, on y=0,1, or 9.\n\nBut y=9 at t=8 is impossible, since from y=1 at t=2, to y=9 at t=8, that would require 7 up moves in 6 turns? From t=2 to t=8, 6 turns: positions from y2 to y8.\n\ny2=1, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7, y8.\n\nTo have y8=9, need +7 in 6 steps, impossible since max change per step is +1, so y8 <= y2 +6 =7.\n\nSimilarly, y9 <=8.\n\nSo cannot be at y=9 before t=10.\n\nThus, at t=8 and t=9, I cannot be on y=9.\n\nTherefore, at t=8, I must be on y=0 or y=1.\n\nSimilarly at t=9, on y=0 or y=1.\n\nThen, after t=9, I can go up to y=9.\n\nNow, also, I have to avoid other dangers, like row 1 at t=6.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nI start at t=2, y=1.\n\nI need to be at y=0 or 1 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nAlso, at t=6, I must not be on y=1.\n\nNow, since I need to reach y=9 eventually, and I have to go up, I should minimize waiting.\n\nFirst, from t=2 to t=8, I have 6 turns to go from y=1 to, say, y=1 or y=0 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut at t=6, I cannot be on y=1.\n\nNow, let's see the position over time.\n\nDenote the actions.\n\nSet t=2: y=1\n\nI need to choose actions such that at t=8, y=0 or 1, and at t=9, y=0 or 1.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nBut at t=9, if I am at y=0 or 1, then to reach y=9, I need at least 8 or 9 up moves? From y=1, to y=9, need +8, so at least 8 actions.\n\nBut since I am at t=9, y_t=9 for some t.\n\nAfter being at safe position at t=9, I go up.\n\nFirst, let's get to the safe point at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSince y=0 and y=1 are both safe at t=8,9, and y=1 is higher, better to be at y=1 if possible.\n\nBut at t=6, y=1 is dangerous, so I cannot be on y=1 at t=6.\n\nNow, let's find a sequence where at t=8 and t=9, I am at y=0 or 1.\n\nStart from t=2, y=1.\n\nI can go up, down, or stay.\n\nBut if I go up, I might reach higher rows earlier, but then at t=8 I might be high, which is dangerous.\n\nIf I stay or go down, I can stay low.\n\nFor example, suppose I stay at y=1 until after t=6, but I cannot stay at t=6 because dangerous.\n\nAt t=6, I must not be on y=1.\n\nSo I need to leave y=1 before t=6 or after, but since t=6 is the danger time, I must not be on y=1 exactly at t=6.\n\nSo at t=6, y_t ≠1.\n\nSimilarly, for other times.\n\nSo for row 1, collision only at t=6, so as long as at t=6, I am not on y=1, I am fine, even if on y=1 at other times.\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nI need to be at y=0 or 1 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nFrom t=2 to t=8, 6 turns: t=2,3,4,5,6,7 actions affect positions from y3 to y8.\n\ny2=1\n\nAfter a2, y3\n\nAfter a3, y4\n\n...\n\nAfter a7, y8\n\nAfter a8, y9\n\nActions from a2 to a7 set y3 to y8.\n\ny8 is position at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, y9 at t=9.\n\nI need y8 = 0 or 1, and y9 = 0 or 1.\n\nAlso, during the path, no collision.\n\nNow, to have y8 =0 or 1, starting from y2=1, with 6 actions.\n\nThe net change from y2 to y8 is sum of Δy from t=2 to t=7, that is, a2 to a7.\n\ny8 = y2 + Δy2 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5 + Δy6 + Δy7\n\nSince y2=1, y8 = 1 + sum_{k=2 to7} Δy_k\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so y8 between 1-6= -5 and 1+6=7, but y must be in 0-9, so y8 between 0 and 7.\n\nBut we need y8=0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, y9 = y8 + Δy8\n\nAnd y9 must be 0 or 1.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should not waste moves, so I should go up as much as possible after t=9.\n\nBut first, let's set y8 and y9 to 0 or 1.\n\nSince y8 and y9 both 0 or 1, and y9 = y8 + Δy8, so if y8=0, then Δy8 could be 0 or +1 (if y9=1), but y9 must be 0 or 1, so if y8=0, y9 can be 0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, if y8=1, y9 can be 0 or 1.\n\nBut to be efficient, better to have y8=1 and y9=1, so I don't go down, and I am at y=1 at t=8 and t=9, then from t=9, I can go up to y=9 in 8 moves, but that would be slow.\n\ny9=1 at t=9, then to y10=2, ..., up to y17=9? y9=1, y10=2, ..., y17=9, so at turn 17, y=9.\n\nBut that is late, H=15 actions or something? Let's not jump.\n\nThe number of actions: actions from t=2 to t=2+H-1, y_{2+H}=9.\n\nIf at t=9, y9=1, then to reach y=9, I need to increase by 8, so min actions from there, starting from action at t=9.\n\nAction at t=9 affects y10, etc.\n\nTo reach y_{t} =9 for some t.\n\nIf at turn T, I am at y_T, then to reach y=9, I need at least |9 - y_T| actions.\n\nAnd the turn when I arrive is T + |9 - y_T|.\n\nFor example, if at t=9, y9=1, then I can reach y=9 at t=9 + 8 =17, with 8 up actions.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=9, y9=0, reach at t=18, worse.\n\nBut earlier with direct path, I could reach at t=10, but with collision.\n\nSo to avoid collision, I might reach later.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach earlier than 17.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=9 at t=10, but I need to handle t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=10, y=9 is fine, but at t=8 and t=9, I need to be safe.\n\nIf I can be at y=1 at t=8 and t=9, then from t=9, I go up, but to reach y=9 at t=10, I need to be at y=8 at t=9, but at t=9, if I am at y=8, it is dangerous, collision.\n\nContradiction.\n\nIf I am at y=1 at t=9, I can go to y=2 at t=10, etc, not to 9 directly.\n\nThe earliest to reach y=9 is t=10, with y10=9.\n\nAt t=10, I am at y=9, safe.\n\nAt t=9, I must be at y=8 to go up to y=9, but y=8 at t=9 is dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, if I were to be at y=7 to go to y=8 at t=9, but both dangerous.\n\nSo I cannot be on rows 2-8 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nTherefore, for the direct up path, it is impossible to avoid collision at t=8 and t=9.\n\nI must be at safe position at t=8 and t=9, which is y=0 or 1, and then go up from there.\n\nBut from y=1, it takes 8 turns to reach y=9.\n\nSo the earliest I can reach y=9 is after I have spent time at low rows during t=8 and t=9.\n\nFor example, at t=8, be at y=1, at t=9 at y=1, then from t=9 to t=17, go up to y=9 at t=17.\n\nBut that is slow.\n\nI can be at y=0 at t=8 or something, but similar.\n\nPerhaps I can reach a higher row before t=8, but then I have to go down to y=1 or 0 for t=8 and t=9, which might waste moves.\n\nBut let's see if I can be at y=9 at t=10, but avoid being on dangerous rows at t=8 and t=9 by being on y=0 or 1.\n\nBut to be at y=0 or 1 at t=8, from y=1 at t=2, with 6 actions, if I go down to 0 or stay, I can be at low y.\n\nFor example, suppose I stay at y=1 for some turns, but at t=6 I must not be on y=1.\n\nSo I need to move away at t=6.\n\nLet's plan the sequence.\n\nStart at t=2, y=1, safe.\n\nI need to ensure that at t=6, I am not on y=1.\n\nAlso, at t=8 and t=9, on y=0 or 1.\n\nNow, let's list actions.\n\nSet t=2: y=1\n\nChoose a2.\n\nIf I go up, a2=U, then y3=2\n\nAt t=3, y=2, row 2: dangerous at t=8,9, not now, so safe.\n\nThen a3, I can go up again, y4=3, safe.\n\nSimilarly, a4=U, y5=4, safe.\n\na5=U, y6=5, safe.\n\nt=5: y=4\n\na5=U, y6=5\n\nAt t=6, y=5, not on y=1, good.\n\nRow 5: dangerous at t=8,9, not t=6, safe.\n\nThen a6, I can go up, y7=6\n\nt=7, y=6, row 6, dangerous at t=8,9, not t=7, safe.\n\nNow at t=7, y=6.\n\nI need at t=8, y8=0 or 1.\n\nBut y7=6, so to have y8=0 or 1, I need to go down, a7=D, then y8=5? y8 = y7 + Δy7.\n\nIf a7=D, Δy7=-1, y8=5.\n\nBut y8=5, which is not 0 or 1, and at t=8, on row 5, dangerous! Collision.\n\nIf a7=S, y8=6, still not 0 or 1, dangerous.\n\nIf a7=U, y8=7, worse.\n\nSo from y7=6, I cannot reach y8=0 or 1 in one step; the best I can do is y8=5 with D, but 5 is dangerous at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down earlier.\n\nSuppose at some point I go down to lower rows.\n\nFor example, from t=2, y=1, I could stay or go down.\n\nBut let's think differently.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=1 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nTo be at y=1 at t=8, starting from y=1 at t=2.\n\nWith 6 actions from a2 to a7, y8 = 1 + sum_{k=2 to7} Δy_k\n\nSet y8=1, so sum_{k=2 to7} Δy_k =0\n\nSimilarly, for y9=1, y9 = y8 + Δy8 =1 + Δy8, so if y9=1, then Δy8=0.\n\nIf I want y9=1, then a8=S.\n\nSimilarly, during the path, I need to avoid collision, including not on y=1 at t=6.\n\nNow, with sum Δy from t=2 to7 equal to 0, so the net change is zero, so I return to y=1 at t=8.\n\nBut I was at y=1 at t=2, so I need to move away and come back.\n\nFor example, I can go down to y=0 and come back, or go up and down, but with net zero.\n\nBut I need to avoid t=6 on y=1.\n\nLet's list the positions.\n\nt=2: y=1\n\nNow, for t=6, y_t must not be 1.\n\nSo at t=6, y6 ≠1.\n\ny6 is position after actions from a2 to a5? y2=1\n\na2: Δy2, y3=1 + Δy2\n\na3: Δy3, y4=1 + Δy2 + Δy3\n\na4: Δy4, y5=1 + Δy2 + Δy3 + Δy4\n\na5: Δy5, y6=1 + Δy2 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\na6: Δy6, y7=1 + Δy2 + ... + Δy6\n\na7: Δy7, y8=1 + Δy2 + ... + Δy7\n\nSet y8=1, so Δy2 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5 + Δy6 + Δy7 =0\n\nAlso y6 =1 + Δy2 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5 ≠1, so Δy2 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5 ≠0\n\nThat is, the sum from k=2 to5 of Δy_k ≠0\n\nSimilarly, at each turn, no collision.\n\nNow, to minimize the number of actions later, I should not go down too much, but since I need to reach y=9, the total net up must be +8.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on the first part.\n\nSince I have to waste some moves to stay low, but I can use that to avoid t=6 on y=1.\n\nFor example, at t=2, I can go down to y=0.\n\na2=D, then y3=0\n\nAt t=3, y=0, safe, no cars.\n\nThen a3, I can stay or go up.\n\nBut I need to be not on y=1 at t=6, etc.\n\nAnother idea: since row 7 is dangerous at t=2 and t=3, but I am not on it, irrelevant.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 after t=9.\n\nFor example, at t=9, be at y=1, then go up 8 times to y=9 at t=17.\n\nBut that is H=15 actions? Let's calculate the turn.\n\nActions from t=2 to t=2+H-1, y_{2+H}=9.\n\nIf at t=9, y9=1, then to have y_{2+H}=9, if 2+H =9 + K, where K is the number of actions from t=9 onwards.\n\ny9=1, after M actions, at turn 9+M, y_{9+M} =1 + sum of Δy from t=9 to 9+M-1.\n\nSet 1 + sum =9, so sum=8, min M=8, so y_{9+8}=y17=9.\n\nThus 2+H =17, so H=15.\n\nBut this is large, and I can do better by not staying at y=1 all time.\n\nFor example, I can go up to higher rows before t=8, but then at t=8 and t=9, I go down to y=0 or 1.\n\nBut going down costs moves.\n\nLet's calculate the minimal H.\n\nSuppose I go up as fast as possible to some point, then down to safety at t=8 and t=9, then up to 9.\n\nFor example, from t=2 to t=7, I go up to some y, then at t=7 and t=8 actions to go down to y=0 or 1 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nThen from there up.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, I need to be safe.\n\nAlso, at t=6, not on y=1.\n\nFirst, what is the highest I can be at t=7.\n\nFrom t=2 y=1, with 5 actions: a2 to a6, position y7.\n\ny7 = y2 + Δy2 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5 + Δy6\n\nMax y7 if all U, y7=1+5=6\n\nMin y7=1-5= -4, but y=0 min, so y7<=6.\n\nAt t=7, y=6.\n\nThen I need y8=0 or 1.\n\nFrom y7=6, to y8=0 or 1, I must go down, a7=D or multiple, but only one action, so with a7, I can go to y8=5,6, or7.\n\nNone of which is 0 or 1. 5,6,7 all dangerous at t=8.\n\nIf I am lower at t=7.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=7, I am at y=1.\n\nThen a7, I can go to y8=0,1,2.\n\nIf y8=0 or 1, safe at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, I am on y8, choose a8 to set y9.\n\nIf y8=0, a8 can be S, y9=0; U, y9=1; D not, y=0 min.\n\nSimilarly, if y8=1, a8=S, y9=1; U, y9=2; D, y9=0.\n\nBut y9 must be 0 or 1, so if y8=0, y9 can be 0 or 1; if y8=1, y9 can be 0 or 1.\n\nBut at t=9, on y9, if y9=2, it is dangerous, not allowed, so y9 must be 0 or 1.\n\nSo from above, if at t=7, y7=1, then I can set a7 such that y8=0 or 1.\n\nFor example, a7=S, y8=1; or a7=D, y8=0.\n\nThen at t=8, y8=0 or 1, safe.\n\nThen a8, if y8=0, a8 can be S or U; if a8=S, y9=0; if a8=U, y9=1.\n\nIf y8=1, a8=S, y9=1; a8=D, y9=0.\n\nSo I can set y9=0 or 1, safe.\n\nThen from t=9, y9=0 or 1, I go up to y=9 in 8 or 9 turns.\n\nBut to have y7=1, from y2=1, with 5 actions: a2 to a6, y7 =1 + sum_{k=2 to6} Δy_k\n\nSet y7=1, so sum_{k=2 to6} Δy_k =0\n\nAlso, at t=6, y6 ≠1.\n\ny6 =1 + sum_{k=2 to5} Δy_k\n\nSince y7=1 + sum_{k=2 to6} Δy_k =1, so sum_{k=2 to6} Δy_k =0\n\ny6 =1 + sum_{k=2 to5} Δy_k\n\ny6 ≠1, so sum_{k=2 to5} Δy_k ≠0\n\nWith 5 actions, net zero, but not zero for first 4.\n\nI need to have some down or up and down.\n\nFor example, go down to y=0 and back.\n\nOr go up and down.\n\nBut also avoid collision during the path.\n\nFor example, at t=2, y=1, safe.\n\nSuppose a2=D, then y3=0, at t=3, y=0, safe.\n\na3=U, y4=1, at t=4, y=1, safe (row 1 dangerous only at t=6)\n\na4=S, y5=1, at t=5, y=1, safe.\n\na5, if I go U, y6=2, at t=6, y=2, row 2: dangerous at t=8,9, not t=6, so safe.\n\nThen a6, to set y7.\n\ny6=2, I need y7=1, so a6=D, y7=1.\n\nAt t=6, y=2, safe as above.\n\nAt t=7, y=1, safe.\n\nNow, at t=7, y=1, as planned.\n\nThen a7: I can set y8.\n\nFor example, a7=S, then y8=1, at t=8, y=1, safe.\n\nThen a8: to set y9.\n\nIf I want y9=1, a8=S, y9=1.\n\nThen at t=9, y=1, safe.\n\nNow, from here, I need to go to y=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=1.\n\nThen I can start going up.\n\nActions from t=9 onwards.\n\na9=U, y10=2\n\nBut at t=10, y=2, row 2: dangerous at t=8 and t=9, but t=10>9, so not dangerous? t=8 and t=9 are the only dangerous times for row 2, at t=10, no collision, safe.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nFor row 2, dangerous only at t=8 and t=9, so at t=10, safe.\n\nSimilarly for all rows, after t=9, no danger? Let's see.\n\nRow 1: dangerous only at t=6\n\nRow 2: t=8,9\n\nRow 3: t=8,9\n\n...\n\nRow 6: t=8,9\n\nRow 7: t=8,9\n\nRow 8: t=8,9\n\nAll dangerous times are t<=9, so for t>=10, all rows are safe, no collision possible.\n\nIs that true?\n\nFor example, row 1, car at t=6 only, so for t>6, no danger.\n\nRow 2, t=8,9, so t=10 and after, no danger.\n\nSimilarly, all rows have no danger for t>=10.\n\nTherefore, after t=9, I can move freely without worrying about cars.\n\nGreat.\n\nSo in this case, at t=9, I am at y=1, then I can go up directly to y=9.\n\na9=U, y10=2\n\na10=U, y11=3\n\n...\n\nup to a16=U, y17=9\n\nSo y17=9, reached at turn 17.\n\nH such that y_{2+H}=17, so 2+H=17, H=15.\n\nBut this is with many wasted moves.\n\nI can be at higher position at t=9.\n\nFor example, instead of being at y=1 at t=9, I could be at y=2 or higher, but at t=9, if I am on y=2 to 8, it is dangerous, so I must be at y=0 or 1 at t=9.\n\nSo I cannot be higher than 1 at t=9.\n\nSimilarly at t=8.\n\nSo the highest I can be at t=9 is y=1.\n\nThen from there, it takes 8 turns to reach y=9.\n\nBut to reach y=1 at t=9, I need to have moved from start.\n\nIn the above, I have y9=1.\n\nBut I started at y2=1, so I wasted 7 turns to go down and up but back to 1.\n\nI can be at y=1 at t=9 with fewer actions by not moving much.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=1 from t=2 to t=9, but at t=6, I must not be on y=1, so I cannot stay; I have to leave at t=6.\n\nIn the earlier sequence, I went to y=0 and back or to y=2 and back.\n\nBut net, I am at y=1 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 faster, since after t=9 it is safe, I can be at a higher row at some point before, but I have to be low at t=8 and t=9.\n\nThe turn when I reach y=9 is minimized if I am as high as possible at t=9, but at t=9 I can only be at y=0 or 1, so maximum y=1.\n\nThen I reach at t=17.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach earlier by being at y=9 at t=10, but it requires being at y=8 at t=9, which is impossible without collision.\n\nSo t=10 is impossible.\n\nNext possible is t=11? At t=11, y11=9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at t=11, I need to be at y=8 at t=10, since a10=U.\n\nAt t=10, y=8, row 8: dangerous at t=8 and t=9, but t=10>9, so no danger, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, I need to be at y=8 to go to y=9 at t=10 with a9=U, but at t=9, y=8 is dangerous.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=11, I can be at y=7 at t=10, then a10=U, y11=8? y11=9.\n\ny10 must be 8, with a10=U.\n\nThen at t=10, y=8, safe as above.\n\nBut at t=9, I need to be at some position to reach y10=8.\n\ny10 = y9 + Δy9\n\nIf at t=9, I am at y9, then Δy9 sets y10.\n\nIf y9=7, then a9=U, y10=8; or y9=8, a9=S, y10=8; or y9=9, a9=D, but y9=9 not possible.\n\nBut at t=9, if y9=7, row 7 dangerous at t=9, collision.\n\nSimilarly, y9=8, dangerous.\n\ny9=9 impossible.\n\ny9=0 or 1 safe.\n\nBut if y9=1, then to have y10=8, I need +7 in one step, impossible.\n\nMax Δy=1, so from y9=1, y10<=2.\n\nCannot reach y10=8.\n\nSimilarly, from y9=0, y10<=1.\n\nSo impossible to have y10=8 if y9=0 or 1.\n\nTherefore, I cannot reach y=9 before t=17? t=11 is impossible.\n\nt=12: y12=9.\n\nThen y11 must be 8 or 9, but y11=9 impossible, so y11=8, with a11=U.\n\nAt t=11, y=8, safe since t=11>9.\n\nNow, y11=8, which must come from y10 + Δy10.\n\ny10 could be 7,8,9.\n\ny10=9 impossible.\n\ny10=8, a10=S, y11=8\n\ny10=7, a10=U, y11=8\n\nAt t=10, y=10, row? y=8 at t=10, safe.\n\nBut to have y10=7 or 8, I need to be at that at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, y=10, safe.\n\nBut at t=9, I need to set y10.\n\ny10 = y9 + Δy9\n\nAt t=9, y9 must be 0 or 1 to be safe.\n\nThen y10 = y9 + Δy9 <= 1 +1 =2 or 0+1=1.\n\nSo y10 <=2.\n\nBut to have y11=8, I need y10=7 or 8, which is impossible since y10<=2.\n\nSimilarly for later turns.\n\nFor example, to reach y=9 at turn T, I need to be at y=8 at turn T-1.\n\nAt turn T-1, if T-1 <=9, and if y=8, it may be dangerous if T-1=8 or 9.\n\nBut for T-1 >=10, safe.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at turn S, I need to be at y=7 or 8 or 9 at turn S-1, and so on.\n\nBut the problem is at turn 9, I must be at y=0 or 1.\n\nFrom y=0 or 1 at t=9, the earliest I can be at y=8 is at t=9 +7 =16, with 7 up moves: from y9=1, y10=2, y11=3, y12=4, y13=5, y14=6, y15=7, y16=8, then a16=U, y17=9.\n\nOr from y9=1, to y17=9 in 8 steps.\n\nIf I am at y=0 at t=9, worse.\n\nSo minimal to reach y=9 is at t=17.\n\nBut let's see if I can be at a higher row at t=9 by having moved before, but at t=9 I can only be at y=0 or 1, so no.\n\nTherefore, the minimal turn to reach y=9 is 17, with H=15 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nFirst, from t=2 to t=9, I need to be at y=0 or 1 at t=8 and t=9, and avoid collision, including not on y=1 at t=6.\n\nIn the sequence I had earlier:\n\nt=2: y=1\n\na2=D, y3=0  (down to avoid)\n\nt=3: y=0, safe\n\na3=U, y4=1\n\nt=4: y=1, safe\n\na4=S, y5=1  (stay)\n\nt=5: y=1, safe\n\na5=U, y6=2  (up to not be on y=1 at t=6)\n\nt=6: y=2, row 2, not dangerous at t=6, safe\n\na6=D, y7=1  (down to prepare for t=7)\n\nt=7: y=1, safe\n\na7=S, y8=1  (stay at y=1 for t=8)\n\nt=8: y=1, safe\n\na8=S, y9=1  (stay at y=1 for t=9)\n\nt=9: y=1, safe\n\nNow, from here, go up:\n\na9=U, y10=2\n\nt=10: y=2, safe (no danger)\n\na10=U, y11=3\n\na11=U, y12=4\n\na12=U, y13=5\n\na13=U, y14=6\n\na14=U, y15=7\n\na15=U, y16=8\n\na16=U, y17=9\n\nReached at t=17.\n\nH actions: from a2 to a16, that's 15 actions.\n\ny_{2+H} = y17=9, so 2+H=17, H=15.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nPerhaps I can save some actions.\n\nFor example, at t=5, instead of going up, I could stay or something.\n\nBut in this, I have some extra moves.\n\nFrom t=2 to t=9, I am at y=1 at t=9, but I started at y=1 at t=2, so net no progress.\n\nBut I had to move to avoid t=6 on y=1.\n\nIn the sequence, I used a2=D, a3=U, a4=S, a5=U, a6=D, a7=S, a8=S.\n\nThat's 7 actions to go from y=1 to y=1, with changes.\n\nBut I could have fewer actions that cancel.\n\nFor example, at t=2, a2=S, y3=1\n\nt=3: y=1, but at t=3, safe, row 1 only dangerous at t=6.\n\na3=S, y4=1\n\na4=S, y5=1\n\nNow at t=5, y=1, I need to not be at y=1 at t=6, so I must move.\n\na5 cannot be S, must be U or D.\n\nIf a5=U, y6=2\n\nThen at t=6, y=2, safe.\n\nThen I need to get back to y=1 for t=8 and t=9.\n\na6, if a6=D, y7=1\n\nt=7: y=1, safe\n\na7=S, y8=1\n\na8=S, y9=1\n\nThen same as before.\n\nIf at t=5, a5=D, y6=0\n\nt=6: y=0, safe\n\nThen a6=U, y7=1\n\nt=7: y=1\n\na7=S, y8=1\n\na8=S, y9=1\n\nSame thing.\n\nIn all cases, to avoid t=6 on y=1, I must have a move at t=5 that changes y, so I am not at y=1 at t=6, then I need to come back to y=1 by t=7 or t=8.\n\nIn the sequence, I have at least two actions that are not S: one to leave y=1 before t=6, and one to return.\n\nFor example, a5=U or D, and a6=D or U to return.\n\nThen the other actions can be S.\n\nBut in the net, I am at y=1 at t=7 or t=8.\n\nIn the sequence above, with a5=U, a6=D, I am back at y=1 at t=7.\n\nThen a7=S, a8=S to stay for t=8 and t=9.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, I am at y=1, which is fine.\n\nThen from t=9, go up.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 at t=17.\n\nBut perhaps I can start going up earlier, but I have to be low at t=8 and t=9.\n\nAnother idea: at t=9, I am at y=1, but if I go up immediately, but I can only go to y=2 at t=10, etc.\n\nBut after t=9, it's safe, so no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=0 at t=9, but that would require going down, which is worse.\n\nSo y=1 at t=9 is best.\n\nNow, to have y9=1, with the constraint.\n\nBut in the sequence, I used actions that are not all necessary.\n\nFor example, in the first part, I can have fewer non-stay actions.\n\nMinimal actions to have y9=1 and not on y=1 at t=6.\n\nFrom t=2 to t=9, 7 turns, actions a2 to a8 affect y3 to y9.\n\ny2=1\n\ny9 = y2 + Δy2 + ... + Δy8\n\nSet y9=1, so sum_{k=2 to8} Δy_k =0\n\nAlso, at t=6, y6 ≠1\n\ny6 = y2 + Δy2 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5 =1 + sum_{k=2 to5} Δy_k\n\nSet not equal to 1, so sum_{k=2 to5} Δy_k ≠0\n\nThe actions from a2 to a8, 7 actions, net sum Δy=0.\n\nI can have, for example, all S except one U and one D at appropriate times.\n\nFor instance, to have sum from k=2 to5 not zero, I can have a5=U, then sum to t=5 is +1, y6=2\n\nThen to compensate, I need a down later.\n\nFor example, a2=S, y3=1\n\na3=S, y4=1\n\na4=S, y5=1\n\na5=U, y6=2\n\nt=6: y=2, safe\n\nThen a6, to get back, a6=D, y7=1\n\nt=7: y=1\n\na7=S, y8=1\n\na8=S, y9=1\n\nThen from t=9, go up as before.\n\nIn this, I used a5=U and a6=D, net zero, and other S.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 2: S (a2=S)\n\nBut at turn t, the action is a_t.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 2: S  (y3=1)\n\nTurn 3: S  (y4=1)\n\nTurn 4: S  (y5=1)\n\nTurn 5: U  (y6=2)\n\nTurn 6: D  (y7=1)\n\nTurn 7: S  (y8=1)\n\nTurn 8: S  (y9=1)\n\nThen from turn 9: U (y10=2)\n\nTurn 10: U (y11=3)\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 16: U (y17=9)\n\nBut turn 16 action, a16=U, y17=9.\n\nH=15 actions from a2 to a16.\n\ny_{2+H}=y17=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from turn 2 to turn 16.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be from turn t1 to t1+H-1, so for H=15, actions from turn 2 to turn 2+14=16.\n\nt1=2, actions a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: a2, t=1: a3, ..., t=14: a16.\n\nYes.\n\nBut perhaps I can reduce H by not staying so much.\n\nFor example, if I go up to higher rows before t=8, but then I have to go down to y=1 for t=8 and t=9, which might take more actions.\n\nFor instance, suppose I go up to y=6 at t=7, but then from y=6 to y=1 at t=8, impossible in one step, so I need to go down earlier.\n\nBut going down costs, and I still need to be at y=1 at t=9.\n\nNet, it might not save.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=2, I go up to y=5 by t=7 with all U.\n\nt=2: y=1, a2=U, y3=2\n\na3=U, y4=3\n\na4=U, y5=4\n\na5=U, y6=5\n\na6=U, y7=6\n\na7=U, y8=7\n\nBut at t=8, y=7, dangerous, and I need to be at 0 or 1.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf I go down at t=7, a7=D, y8=6, still dangerous.\n\nNot good.\n\nTo be at y=1 at t=8, I need to have come from lower or same.\n\nBut from high, I cannot reach low fast.\n\nSo the above sequence seems efficient in terms of min H.\n\nBut H=15, and in the sequence, I have many S actions, which are fine.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 faster by not being at y=1 at t=9, but since I must be safe at t=9, I have to be at 0 or 1.\n\nAnother thought: at t=9, if I am at y=1, but I can start going up from t=7 or something, but at t=8, I need to be at y=0 or 1.\n\nFor example, at t=7, if I am at y=1, I can go up at a7=U, but then y8=2, which at t=8 is dangerous.\n\nNot allowed.\n\nIf I stay, y8=1, safe, but then I am at y=1, same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo I think H=15 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm with the car states.\n\nIn the sequence, during the path, are there any collisions?\n\nFor example, at t=6, y=2, row 2: cars, but at t=6, for row 2, the car is at: tail=-47 +6*(6-2)= -47 +24= -23, head=-36+24= -12, span [-23,-12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nAt t=8, y=1, row 1: car at t=8, tail=-59 +12*(6)= -59+72=13? T-2=6, tail=-59+12*6= -59+72=13, head=-48+72=24, span [13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=9, y=1, same row, car not at 0.\n\nThen after t=9, all safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions:\n\nFrom turn 2 to turn 16, but actions from a2 to a16.\n\nBut a16 is the last action to reach y17=9.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be the actions from turn t1 onwards.\n\nt1=2.\n\nSo minimal H is 15.\n\nBut perhaps I can save one turn by being at y=1 at t=8 and going up from t=8, but at t=8, if I go up, y9=2, but at t=9, y=2 is dangerous, not allowed.\n\nSo I must stay or go down at t=8 to be safe at t=9.\n\nThus, the sequence I have is fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 8, I have S, y9=1, then from turn 9, U.\n\nBut turn 8 action is S, which is fine.\n\nTo output:\n\nThe actions:\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nThen Turn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nAfter a16=U, y17=9.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 2 to turn 16, 15 actions.\n\nH=15.\n\nBut let's count the turns: actions at turn 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. That's 15 actions.\n\nPosition at turn 17=9.\n\nIn the action list, from turn 2 to turn 16.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nBut in the sequence, after turn 5 U, at turn 6 position y6=2, then turn 6 action D, so y7=1, etc.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I can have a shorter sequence if I go to y=0 at t=9, but that would be worse.\n\nOr if I use fewer S actions.\n\nFor example, at turn 2, instead of S, I could go U, but then I am higher, and I need to come down for t=8 and t=9, which might cost more.\n\nSuppose at turn 2: U, y3=2\n\nThen I need to be at y=0 or 1 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nFrom y3=2 to y8=0 or 1 in 5 actions, net change down by 1 or 2.\n\nBut then at t=6, I need to not be on y=1, etc., it might not save actions.\n\nFor instance, to have y8=1, from y3=2, I need net change -1 in 5 actions.\n\nBut also constraints.\n\nIt might not reduce H.\n\nSince min H is 15, I think it's fine.\n\nBut let's see the car on freeway 7 and 8 at t=2 and t=3.\n\nFor example, at t=2, on row 7, the second car is at (0,-11,right,6), at t=2, head=0, so at x=0, collision if on row 7 at t=2.\n\nBut I am not on it.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo the sequence should work.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut in the action sequence, from turn 9 to 16, I have 8 U actions, but I can list them.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut H=15, and the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up earlier after being safe at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, I am at y=1, if I go up at turn 8, a8=U, then y9=2, but at t=9, y=2 is dangerous, not allowed.\n\nSo I cannot.\n\nThus, I must have a8 such that y9=0 or 1, so a8 must be S or D if y8=1.\n\nIn my sequence, a8=S, y9=1.\n\nThen a9=U, etc.\n\nSo I think it's minimal.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 15, with the sequence above.\n\nBut let's write it clearly.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 15. This requires a sequence of actions that ensures the player is on a safe row (y=0 or y=1) during turns 8 and 9, when all rows from y=2 to y=8 are dangerous due to cars at x=0. After turn 9, all rows are safe, allowing the player to move up directly to y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed to:\n- Stay at or return to y=1 by turn 7.\n- Avoid being on y=1 at turn 6 (when row y=1 is dangerous).\n- Be at y=1 at turns 8 and 9 (safe rows).\n- From turn 10 onwards, move up to y=9 without collisions, as no cars pose a threat after turn 9.\n\nThe action sequence from turn 2 to turn 16 (15 actions) is:\n\n- **Turn 2: S** (stay, y=1 → y=1) – Safe, as row y=1 is not dangerous at t=2.\n- **Turn 3: S** (stay, y=1 → y=1) – Safe.\n- **Turn 4: S** (stay, y=1 → y=1) – Safe.\n- **Turn 5: U** (up, y=1 → y=2) – Avoids being on y=1 at t=6. Safe, as row y=2 is not dangerous at t=5.\n- **Turn 6: D** (down, y=2 → y=1) – Safe, as row y=2 is not dangerous at t=6. Returns to y=1.\n- **Turn 7: S** (stay, y=1 → y=1) – Safe.\n- **Turn 8: S** (stay, y=1 → y=1) – Safe, as y=1 is safe at t=8.\n- **Turn 9: S** (stay, y=1 → y=1) – Safe, as y=1 is safe at t=9.\n- **Turn 10: U** (up, y=1 → y=2) – Safe, no danger after t=9.\n- **Turn 11: U** (up, y=2 → y=3) – Safe.\n- **Turn 12: U** (up, y=3 → y=4) – Safe.\n- **Turn 13: U** (up, y=4 → y=5) – Safe.\n- **Turn 14: U** (up, y=5 → y=6) – Safe.\n- **Turn 15: U** (up, y=6 → y=7) – Safe.\n- **Turn 16: U** (up, y=7 → y=8) – Reaches y=9 at turn 17, safe.\n\nThis sequence achieves y=9 at turn 17 with H=15 actions, starting from turn 2. Any fewer actions would require being on a dangerous row (y=2 to y=8) during turns 8 or 9, leading to collision, or violating the constraint at turn 6 for y=1.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 2: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

The current turn is t1=4, and I start at y=1.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. The cars move right or left with a certain speed, and I need to avoid being on a row where a car covers position 0 at the turn when I'm on that row.\n\nThe collision condition is that at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at that turn.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, if I move to a different row, I'm not considered on that new row until the next turn. So for collision, at turn T, I'm only on row y_T, and I check cars on that row at turn T.\n\nLet me list all the cars and their positions over time.\n\nSince all cars are moving right except for the directions given, but in the table, for freeway 1 to 6, there's only one car each, all right-moving, and for 7 and 8, there are three cars each, all right-moving.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (-24,-35, right, 12)\n\nSince it's right-moving, span at t is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nThe update rule says:\n\nFor left-moving: span(t) = [h - s(t - t1), τ - s(t - t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t) = [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)]\n\nIn the initial state, at t1=4, for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] because at T=t1, span(T) = [τ + s(0), h + s(0)] = [τ, h].\n\nSimilarly for left.\n\nBut in the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed).\n\nFor right-moving, at t1, head is h, tail is τ, so since it's moving right, head is to the right, so span is [τ, h], meaning from tail to head, left to right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] with h left, τ right, but here all are right-moving, so head is right, tail is left.\n\nIn the freeway 7 and 8, it shows (12,1,right,6), so head=12, tail=1, so at t1=4, span is [1,12] for that car.\n\nSimilarly, (-24,-35,right,6), head=-24, tail=-35? Tail should be left, head right, but -35 is less than -24, so tail=-35, head=-24, so span at t1 is [ -35, -24 ] for that car.\n\nBut position 0 is what matters.\n\nNow, I need to find when each car covers position 0 at different turns.\n\nSince I start at y=1 at t=4, and I need to go to y=9.\n\nThe player position is vertical axis y=0 to 9, but freeways are y=1 to 8, I think y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe grid has y=0 to 9, freeways with cars are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so I can be there without collision.\n\nI start at (0,1) at t=4, and I need to reach (0,9), so y=9 is the goal.\n\nAt y=1, I am at t=4, and there might be a car on y=1 at t=4.\n\nLet me check for each freeway and each car when 0 is in their span.\n\nFirst, for freeway k, at turn T, for each car, the span is computed.\n\nt1=4 is the current turn.\n\nFor a car, at turn T, the span is:\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s(T-4), h + s(T-4)]\n\n0 is in span if τ + s(T-4) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T-4)\n\nSimilarly for left, but all right here.\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so only that.\n\nSo 0 in [A,B] where A = τ + s(T-4), B = h + s(T-4), so A ≤ 0 ≤ B.\n\nSimilarly, for collision, at turn T, if I am on freeway y at turn T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in span at T.\n\nNow, let's list all cars.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car: h=-24, τ=-35, s=12, right\n\nAt T, span: [ -35 + 12(T-4), -24 + 12(T-4) ]\n\n0 in span if -35 +12(T-4) ≤ 0 ≤ -24 +12(T-4)\n\nLet t_delta = T-4, so for delta turns from now.\n\n-35 +12 t_delta ≤ 0 ≤ -24 +12 t_delta\n\nFirst inequality: -35 +12 t_delta ≤ 0 => 12 t_delta ≤ 35 => t_delta ≤ 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so t_delta <= 2 since integer? t_delta is integer, T is turn, so t_delta integer.\n\nT is turn number, integer, I assume.\n\nSo t_delta = T-4, integer >=0.\n\n-35 +12 t_delta ≤ 0 => 12 t_delta ≤ 35 => t_delta ≤ 35/12 = 2.916, so t_delta <= 2\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -24 +12 t_delta => 24 ≤ 12 t_delta => t_delta >= 24/12 = 2\n\nSo t_delta >=2 and t_delta <=2, so t_delta=2.\n\nThus at T=4+2=6, 0 is in span for freeway 1 car.\n\nFor t_delta=2: A = -35 +12*2 = -35+24= -11\n\nB = -24 +12*2 = -24+24=0\n\nSo [ -11, 0 ], 0 is included, yes.\n\nFor t_delta=1: A= -35+12= -23, B= -24+12= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nt_delta=3: A= -35+36=1, B= -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=6, car on freeway 1 covers position 0.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car: (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nh=-24, τ=-35, s=6\n\nAt T, span: [ -35 +6(T-4), -24 +6(T-4) ]\n\n0 in span: -35 +6 t_delta ≤ 0 ≤ -24 +6 t_delta\n\nFirst: -35 +6 t_delta ≤ 0 => 6 t_delta ≤ 35 => t_delta ≤ 35/6 ≈ 5.833, so t_delta <=5\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -24 +6 t_delta => 24 ≤ 6 t_delta => t_delta >=4\n\nSo t_delta=4,5\n\nFor t_delta=4: A= -35 +24= -11, B= -24+24=0, [-11,0]\n\nt_delta=5: A= -35+30= -5, B= -24+30=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nt_delta=6: A= -35+36=1, B= -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=4+4=8 and T=4+5=9, car on freeway 2 covers 0.\n\nT=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-24,-35,right,6) same parameters.\n\nFreeway 3: (-24,-35,right,6), identical to freeway 2.\n\nSo same, at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: same\n\nFreeway 6: same\n\nAll freeways 2 to 6 have identical cars: (-24,-35,right,6), so each will have car covering 0 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut for each freeway, it's a different car, but same behavior.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,6) same as above.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6) head=12, tail=1, so at t1=4, span [1,12]\n\ns=6, right\n\nAt T, span: [1 +6(T-4), 12 +6(T-4)]\n\n0 in span: 1 +6 t_delta ≤ 0 ≤ 12 +6 t_delta\n\nLeft: 1 +6 t_delta ≤ 0 => 6 t_delta ≤ -1, impossible since t_delta >=0, 6t_delta>=0, 1>0, so never <=0. So 0 never in span for this car.\n\nSimilarly, right: 0 ≤ 12 +6 t_delta always true since t_delta>=0, but left condition false, so no.\n\nThird car: (48,37,right,6) head=48, tail=37, s=6\n\nAt T, span: [37 +6 t_delta, 48 +6 t_delta]\n\n0 in: 37+6t_delta ≤0 ≤48+6t_delta\n\nLeft: 37+6t_delta <=0? 37>0, impossible. So never.\n\nSo for freeway 7, only the first car matters: (-24,-35,right,6), which covers 0 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same cars as freeway 7: (-24,-35,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (48,37,right,6)\n\nAgain, only first car covers 0 at T=8 and T=9, others never.\n\n(12,1,right,6): at t_delta=0, [1,12], 0 not in; t_delta=1, [7,18], etc., min is 1, so 0 never in.\n\nSimilarly for (48,37).\n\nSo summary for each freeway when position 0 is occupied:\n\nFreeway 1: only at T=6\n\nFreeway 2: at T=8 and T=9\n\nFreeway 3: T=8,9\n\nFreeway 4: T=8,9\n\nFreeway 5: T=8,9\n\nFreeway 6: T=8,9\n\nFreeway 7: at T=8 and T=9 (from first car)\n\nFreeway 8: at T=8 and T=9\n\nNow, I start at y=1 at t=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe player moves with actions U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay in [0,9].\n\nI need to go from y=1 to y=9, so I need at least 8 moves up, but I can stay or go down, but minimal turns, so I should go up as much as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nSince I can stay or move down, but to minimize turns, I should avoid staying or moving down unless necessary to avoid collision.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, from 1 to 9, I need to increase by 8, so minimum 8 turns if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I might need to delay or something to avoid being on a row when a car is at 0.\n\nNow, at t=4, I am on y=1.\n\nIs there a collision at t=4 on y=1?\n\nFor freeway 1, at t=4, what is the span? t_delta=0, [τ, h] = [-35,-24], which is [-35,-24], 0 not in, so no car at 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows, but I'm on y=1.\n\nNow, I need to plan a sequence of actions.\n\nLet me denote the turn relative to t1=4, so t=4 + t for t=0,1,2,... but t from 0.\n\nSet time from now: let k = T - t1 = T - 4, so k=0 is now.\n\nAt k=0, y=1.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some H, so at turn t1 + H, y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, and after H actions, at turn t1 + H, y=9.\n\nAfter t actions, at turn t1 + t, position y_{t1 + t}.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t1, y = initial =1.\n\nAfter first action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, y = y_{t1} + Δy, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, y = y_{t1} + sum of Δy from t=0 to H-1.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\ny_{t1} =1, so sum_{t=0}^{H-1} Δy_t = 8.\n\nEach Δy_t is +1, -1, or 0, so to minimize H, I need as many +1 as possible, so ideally all U, H=8.\n\nBut I might have to take S or D if I would be on a row with collision.\n\nNow, collisions depend on when I am on which row.\n\nAt each turn T, I am on some y_T, and I must not have collision on that row at that turn.\n\nNow, from above, the dangerous times:\n\nFor row 1: only dangerous at T=6, since at k=2, t=6, car covers 0.\n\nAt other times, no car covers 0 on row 1.\n\nSimilarly, for row 2: dangerous at T=8 and T=9 (k=4 and k=5)\n\nSimilarly for row 3 to 8, all dangerous at T=8 and T=9, except row 1 is only at T=6.\n\nRow 1 has car only at T=6.\n\nRows 2 to 8 all have cars at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow, I start at y=1 at k=0 (t=4).\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nI can be on y=0 or y=9 at any time without collision.\n\nBut y=9 is goal, so I need to be on y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince I start at y=1, and need to reach y=9, with min actions.\n\nIf I go all up, I can be at y=9 in 8 steps: at k=8, y=1+8=9.\n\nBut let's see if I can do that without collision.\n\nAt each step, I need to check if when I am on a row, it is not dangerous at that time.\n\nSo let's simulate going straight up.\n\nStart: k=0, t=4, y=1. Safe, as we saw.\n\nAction U: to y=2 at k=1, t=5.\n\nAt t=5, y=2.\n\nIs row 2 dangerous at t=5?\n\nFrom above, row 2 is dangerous at T=8 and 9, not at T=5.\n\nAt T=5, k=1, t_delta=1.\n\nFor row 2, car: (-24,-35,right,6), at t_delta=1, span: [ -35 +6(1), -24 +6(1) ] = [-29,-18], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nAction U: to y=3 at k=2, t=6.\n\nAt t=6, y=3.\n\nRow 3 dangerous? At t=6, k=2.\n\nRow 3 car: similar, at t_delta=2, span: [ -35 +12, -24 +12] = [-23,-12], 0 not in. T=6, t_delta=2.\n\nBut row 3 dangerous only at T=8,9, which are later.\n\nAt T=6, k=2, t_delta=2, for row 3: [ -35 +6*2, -24 +6*2] = [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12], not cover 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nAction U: to y=4 at k=3, t=7.\n\nAt t=7, y=4.\n\nRow 4 at t=7, t_delta=3: [ -35 +18, -24+18] = [-17,-6], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nAction U: to y=5 at k=4, t=8.\n\nAt t=8, y=5.\n\nNow t=8, k=4.\n\nRow 5: car covers 0 at t=8? Yes, for row 5, at T=8, t_delta=4, [ -35 +24, -24+24] = [-11,0], 0 in, so dangerous.\n\nAt t=8, if I am on row 5, collision.\n\nIn this path, at t=8, I am on y=5, and row 5 has car covering 0, so collision.\n\nCannot be here.\n\nSo going straight up, at k=4, t=8, y=5, but row 5 is occupied, so I need to avoid that.\n\nSimilarly, if I continue, at t=9, y=6, but row 6 also occupied at t=9? Let's see.\n\nIn straight up, at k=4,t=8,y=5, collision.\n\nSo I need to not be on rows 1-8 at dangerous times.\n\nSpecifically, rows 2-8 are dangerous at t=8 and t=9.\n\nt=8 and t=9.\n\nRow 1 dangerous only at t=6.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nSince I need to reach y=9, and min time, I should go up as fast as possible, but skip the dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nDangerous times are t=8 and t=9 for rows 2-8.\n\nt=6 for row 1 only.\n\nNow, t=8 and t=9 are two consecutive turns.\n\nIf I can be on y=0 or y=9 at t=8 and t=9, or not on those rows.\n\nBut y=0 is below, y=9 is above.\n\nI start from y=1 at t=4.\n\nLet me think about the timing.\n\nI need to cover 8 units up.\n\nEach action can be U, D, S.\n\nTo min H, I should have as few S and D as possible.\n\nSince rows 2-8 are dangerous at t=8 and t=9, I should avoid being on them at those times.\n\nSimilarly, row 1 at t=6.\n\nNow, t=6 is earlier.\n\nLet me list the turns: t=4,5,6,7,8,9,...\n\nAt t=4, I am at y=1, safe.\n\nI need to decide actions.\n\nPerhaps I can go up but slower, or faster, or detour to y=0.\n\nSince y=0 is safe, I can go down to y=0 and wait if needed.\n\nBut going down might increase time.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to y=9 early and wait, but y=9 is goal, once I reach, I can stop, but I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nIf I reach earlier, I can stop actions, but since I specify actions until I reach, H is the number of actions to reach.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1+H, y=9.\n\nSo if I reach earlier, H smaller.\n\nBut in this case, min possible H is 8, but we saw that at t=8, if I go straight, y=5, which is dangerous.\n\nCan I reach y=9 before t=8?\n\nt=4: y=1\n\nt=5: y=2 if U\n\nt=6: y=3 if U\n\nt=7: y=4 if U\n\nt=8: y=5 if U → but collision if on row 5 at t=8\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=8, I need to be at y=9 at turn t=8.\n\nBut from y=1 at t=4, to y=9 at t=8, I need +8 in 4 turns, so I must go up +2 each turn, but I can only change by +1 per turn, so impossible to reach before t=12? t=4 to t=8 is 4 turns, after 4 actions, at t=8, y can be at most 1+4=5, yes.\n\nMinimum time to reach y=9 is t=12: at t=4, y=1; t=5,y=2; ... t=12,y=9. After 8 actions, at t=12, y=9.\n\nt=4: after 0 actions, y=1\n\nAfter 1 action at t=5, y=1 or 2 or 0\n\nAfter 2 actions at t=6, y between 0 and 3, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=t1+H, y between max(0,1-H) and min(9,1+H), but since going up, probably around 1+H.\n\nTo have y=9 at turn T, since start y=1 at t=4, T must be at least 4+8=12 if all U, or later if slower.\n\nEarliest possible T to reach y=9 is t=12, with all U actions.\n\nAt t=12, y=9, which is safe.\n\nBut at intermediate turns, I might be on dangerous rows.\n\nIn the all-U path:\n\nAt t=4, y=1, safe\n\nt=5, y=2, safe (as before)\n\nt=6, y=3, now at t=6, row 3: is it dangerous? At t=6, for row 3, car not at 0, as span [-23,-12], safe.\n\nBut row 1 is dangerous at t=6, but I am on y=3, not y=1.\n\nAt t=6, row 1 has car at 0, but if I am not on y=1, no problem.\n\nIn this path, at t=6, y=3, not on row 1, so safe.\n\nt=7, y=4, row 4 at t=7: car span [ -35 +6*(7-4) = -35+18= -17, -24+18= -6], [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=8, y=5, row 5: car at t=8 covers 0, span [-11,0], 0 in, so if on row 5, collision.\n\nProblem at t=8.\n\nt=9, y=6, row 6 at t=9: car covers 0, since at t=9, t_delta=5, for row 6: [ -35 +30, -24+30] = [-5,6], 0 in, collision.\n\nSimilarly, t=10, y=7, row 7 at t=10: t_delta=6, car [ -35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=11, y=8, row 8 at t=11: t_delta=7, [ -35+42, -24+42] = [7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=12, y=9, safe.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, if I am on y=5 and y=6, collision.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on rows 2-8 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSpecifically, at t=8 and t=9, I should be on y=0 or y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is the goal, I can be on y=9 at t=8 or earlier if possible, but earliest is t=12.\n\nt=12 is the earliest to reach y=9.\n\nBut at t=8, I can be on y=0 or y=9, but y=9 not reachable yet.\n\ny=0 is reachable.\n\nSo I can go down to y=0 at t=8 and t=9 to avoid.\n\nBut that might take extra time.\n\nSince rows are dangerous only at specific times, I can be on other rows.\n\nFor example, at t=8 and t=9, if I am on y=1, but row 1 is not dangerous at t=8 or t=9? Row 1 dangerous only at t=6.\n\nAt t=8, row 1: car at t=8, t_delta=4, [ -35+48? s=12 for row1.\n\nFreeway 1, s=12.\n\nAt t=8, t_delta=4, span [ -35 +12*4, -24 +12*4] = [-35+48, -24+48] = [13,24], not cover 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, t_delta=5, [ -35+60, -24+60] = [25,36], safe.\n\nSo row 1 is safe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSimilarly, row 2: at t=8, dangerous, but at other times safe.\n\nRow 2 dangerous at t=8,9.\n\nBut at t=7, row 2: t_delta=3, [ -35+18, -24+18] = [-17,-6], safe.\n\nt=10, t_delta=6, [ -35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo to avoid collision at t=8 and t=9, I need not to be on rows 2 to 8 at those turns.\n\nI can be on row 1, or row 0, or row 9.\n\nRow 9 safe, but far.\n\nRow 0 safe.\n\nNow, row 1 is safe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nI start from y=1 at t=4.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nOne idea: go up to some point, then at t=8 and t=9, be on a safe row, like y=1 or y=0, then go up after.\n\nBut y=1 might be possible.\n\nLet me plan the path turn by turn.\n\nt=4, k=0: y=1, safe. I need to choose action for next.\n\nI want to minimize H, so I should go up when possible.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, I need to be on safe row.\n\nSafe rows at t=8,9: y=0,1,9\n\nBut y=9 not reachable yet.\n\ny=0 or y=1.\n\ny=1 is row 1, which is safe at t=8,9.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 safe.\n\nNow, at t=4, y=1.\n\nIf I go up immediately, by t=8 I would be at y=5, which is bad.\n\nI can stay on y=1 longer or go down.\n\nBut going down might waste time.\n\nSince row 1 is safe at all times except t=6.\n\nAt t=6, row 1 dangerous.\n\nSo at t=6, I must not be on row 1.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t=6, I should not be on y=1.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8 and t=9, not on y=2 to 8.\n\nNow, let me find a sequence where I avoid those.\n\nStart: t=4, y=1, safe.\n\nAction: I can go U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go U at t=4 (action a_{t1} = a_4), then at t=5, y=2.\n\nt=5, y=2, safe as before.\n\nThen at t=5, I can go U to y=3 at t=6.\n\nBut at t=6, y=3, which is row 3, not dangerous at t=6, as we saw, safe.\n\nThen at t=6, action, if U to y=4 at t=7.\n\nt=7, y=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, action to go to t=8.\n\nNow at t=8, I need to not be on y=2-8.\n\nPossible y=0,1,9.\n\nBut y=4 at t=7, I can go down to y=3 at t=8? But y=3 is row 3, dangerous at t=8.\n\nGo down to y=3: from y=4, D to y=3.\n\nBut y=3 at t=8, dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, U to y=5, dangerous.\n\nS to y=4, dangerous.\n\nSo from y=4 at t=7, no way to be safe at t=8 except if I could go to y=1 or y=0, but from y=4, I can only go to y=3,4,5.\n\nAll between 3-5, which are rows 3,4,5, all dangerous at t=8.\n\ny=3,4,5 are all in 2-8, so dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, if I were at y=2 at t=7, I could go to y=1,2,3, all dangerous except possibly y=1.\n\ny=1 at t=8 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=0, safe.\n\nBut at t=7, if I am at y=2, I can go D to y=1 at t=8.\n\ny=1 safe at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, y=1, safe.\n\nThen I can go up later.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=7, I am at y=1, I can S to y=1 at t=8, safe.\n\nOr go U to y=2, but dangerous.\n\nBut at t=7, y=1, if I go U, to y=2 at t=8, dangerous.\n\nSo better to stay or go down.\n\nBut let's see the sequence from start.\n\nI need to be at a position where at t=7, I can move to y=1 or y=0 for t=8.\n\ny=0 or y=1.\n\nNow, from start, at t=4, y=1.\n\nIf I stay at y=1 for some turns.\n\nFor example, at t=4, action S: stay at y=1 for t=5? Action at t=4 affects y at t=5.\n\nAction a_t at turn t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, I take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAnd at turn t, I am at y_t, and check collision on row y_t at time t.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt turn t=4, y=1, safe.\n\nI take action a_4, which determines y_5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI want at turn t=8, y=1 or 0 or 9.\n\nSimilarly for t=9.\n\nBut t=9 also needs to be safe.\n\nFirst, let's handle t=6: at t=6, I should not be on y=1.\n\nSo at turn t=6, y should not be 1.\n\nNow, from t=4, y=1.\n\nPossible actions:\n\nOption 1: go up immediately.\n\na_4 = U: then y_5 = 1 +1 =2 at t=5.\n\nAt t=5, y=2, safe (row 2 at t=5 not dangerous).\n\nThen a_5 = U: y_6 =2+1=3 at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, y=3, row 3 not dangerous (as before, car at [-23,-12]), safe.\n\nThen a_6 = ? y_7 at t=7.\n\nNow at t=7, y=3? y_6=3, action a_6 determines y_7.\n\nIf a_6=U, y_7=4\n\nIf a_6=S, y_7=3\n\nIf a_6=D, y_7=2\n\nNow, at t=7, y=4,3, or 2, all safe, since no danger at t=7 for these rows.\n\nBut then for t=8, I need y_8 to be 0,1, or9.\n\nBut from y_7, I can only change by +1,0,-1.\n\nSo if y_7=4, I can go to y=3,4,5 at t=8, all dangerous.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf y_7=3, can go to y=2,3,4 at t=8, dangerous.\n\nIf y_7=2, can go to y=1,2,3 at t=8.\n\nNow y=1 is safe at t=8, y=2 and 3 dangerous.\n\nSo I can go to y=1 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, if I can be at y_7=2, then a_7=D to y_7 -1 =1? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at t=7, y_7 is position, then a_7, y_8 = y_7 + Δy_7.\n\nIf I can have y_7=2, then I can set a_7 = D, so y_8 = 2 -1 =1.\n\nThen at t=8, y=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly, for t=9, I need to handle.\n\nFirst, let's get to y_7=2.\n\nIn the sequence so far: t=4, y=1\n\na_4=U, y_5=2\n\na_5=U, y_6=3\n\nNow at t=6, y=3, I need to go down to have y_7=2.\n\nSo a_6 = D, then y_7 = y_6 + (-1) = 3-1=2 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, y=2, which is safe (row 2 at t=7 not dangerous).\n\nThen a_7 = D, y_8 = 2 + (-1) =1 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, y=1, safe as row 1 not dangerous.\n\nNow, at t=8, y=1, I need to go to y=9 eventually.\n\nBut at t=9, I also need to be safe.\n\nAt t=9, y=1, is it safe? Row 1 at t=9, as before, not dangerous, safe.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nI can stay or go up.\n\nBut if I go up to y=2 at t=9, but row 2 at t=9 is dangerous, since car covers 0.\n\nSo at t=9, if on y=2, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=1, safe.\n\nSo at t=9, I should be on y=1 or y=0 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 not yet.\n\nSo I can stay on y=1 at t=9.\n\nThen go up after.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAfter t=8, y=1.\n\nAction a_8, which determines y_9.\n\nIf a_8 = S, then y_9 =1 at t=9, safe.\n\nThen at t=9, y=1, I can start going up.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=1, I need to go up to y=9, which takes at least 8 more turns? No, at t=9, y=1, after actions, at later turn.\n\nBut I can go up.\n\nBut let's list the turns.\n\nt=8: y=1\n\na_8: if S, y_9=1\n\nt=9: y=1, safe.\n\nThen a_9: U, to y=2 at t=10.\n\nt=10: y=2, now row 2 at t=10: t_delta=6, [ -35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\na_10: U to y=3 at t=11\n\nt=11: y=3, row 3 at t=11: t_delta=7, [ -35+42, -24+42] = [7,18], safe? For row 3, car at t=11, t_delta=7, since t1=4, T=11, T-t1=7.\n\n[ -35 +6*7, -24 +6*7] = [-35+42, -24+42] = [7,18], yes 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, a_11: U to y=4 at t=12\n\nt=12: y=4, row 4 at t=12: t_delta=8, [ -35+48, -24+48] = [13,24], safe.\n\na_12: U to y=5 at t=13\n\nt=13: y=5, row 5 at t=13: t_delta=9, [ -35+54, -24+54] = [19,30], safe.\n\na_13: U to y=6 at t=14\n\nt=14: y=6, row 6 at t=14: t_delta=10, [ -35+60, -24+60] = [25,36], safe.\n\na_14: U to y=7 at t=15\n\nt=15: y=7, row 7 at t=15: for the car, t_delta=11, [ -35+66, -24+66] = [31,42], safe? But row 7 has multiple cars, but the one that could be dangerous is the first, but now not.\n\nOthers never dangerous.\n\na_15: U to y=8 at t=16\n\nt=16: y=8, row 8 at t=16: similar, safe.\n\na_16: U to y=9 at t=17\n\nt=17: y=9, safe, goal.\n\nBut this takes many turns: from t=4 to t=17, 13 actions? Let's count.\n\nActions from a4 to a16, that's 13 actions? Turns: after H actions, at turn t1+H.\n\nStart at t=4, after 0 actions.\n\nAfter first action a4, at t=5, y=2? In this sequence:\n\nAt t=4, y=1\n\na4=U → t=5, y=2\n\na5=U → t=6, y=3\n\na6=D → t=7, y=2\n\na7=D → t=8, y=1\n\na8=S → t=9, y=1  (since S, Δy=0)\n\na9=U → t=10, y=2\n\na10=U → t=11, y=3\n\na11=U → t=12, y=4\n\na12=U → t=13, y=5\n\na13=U → t=14, y=6\n\na14=U → t=15, y=7\n\na15=U → t=16, y=8\n\na16=U → t=17, y=9\n\nSo after 13 actions, at t=17, y=9.\n\nBut H=13, which is more than min possible 8.\n\nI can do better.\n\nFor example, at t=8 and t=9, I stayed at y=1, but I could go up faster after.\n\nBut after t=9, I go up, but it takes time.\n\nSince y=1 is safe at t=8 and t=9, I can be there, but I need to reach y=9.\n\nAnother idea: go up faster initially to be higher, but then at t=8,9 I need to be safe.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=9 by t=8, but impossible, min t=12.\n\nOr be at y=0 at t=8, but y=0 is low.\n\nLet's see if I can reach a high y earlier.\n\nMax y at turn t: from y=1 at t=4, at t=5, y<=2, t=6,y<=3, t=7,y<=4, t=8,y<=5, etc.\n\nAt t=8, max y=5, min y=0.\n\nBut y=5 is dangerous, etc.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=1 at t=8 and t=9, but since I start at y=1, if I stay, I am at y=1 at t=5,6,etc.\n\nBut at t=6, y=1 is dangerous.\n\nSo I cannot stay on y=1 at t=6.\n\nIn the earlier sequence, I was at y=3 at t=6, safe.\n\nThen I went down to y=2 at t=7, then to y=1 at t=8.\n\nBut I could go to y=1 directly at t=8 without going down first.\n\nFor example, from start, at t=4, y=1, I can go down to y=0 at some point, but that might be slower.\n\nLet's list the critical points.\n\nI need to avoid y=1 at t=6.\n\nAnd avoid y=2 to 8 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nFor t=8 and t=9, I can be on y=0,1,9.\n\nBut y=9 not possible yet.\n\nSo y=0 or y=1.\n\nSimilarly, for t=6, I can be on any y except 1.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly, I should go up as much as possible except when forced to avoid.\n\nFor example, from t=4 to t=5, I can go U to y=2 at t=5.\n\nt=5, y=2 safe.\n\nThen at t=5 to t=6, I can go U to y=3 at t=6, safe as before.\n\nThen at t=6 to t=7, I need to go to t=7 with y_7 such that I can be at safe y for t=8.\n\nFrom y_6=3, I can go to y_7=2,3,4.\n\nIf I go to y_7=2, then I can go to y_8=1 (by D), which is safe.\n\nIf I go to y_7=4, I can only go to 3,4,5, all dangerous at t=8.\n\nSo only y_7=2 allows me to go to y_8=1.\n\ny_7=3, I can go to y_8=2,3,4, all dangerous except if I could go to 1, but from 3, min y_8=2.\n\ny_7=3, a7=D, y8=2, dangerous.\n\na7=S, y8=3, dangerous.\n\na7=U, y8=4, dangerous.\n\nNo way to y=1 from y=3 in one step.\n\nSimilarly from y=4, impossible.\n\nSo only if I am at y=2 at t=7, I can go to y=1 at t=8.\n\nAt t=7, y must be 2 to reach y=1 at t=8 with one down.\n\nSimilarly, for t=9, I need to be safe.\n\nAt t=8, y=1, I can choose action.\n\nIf I go U to y=2 at t=9, but y=2 at t=9 dangerous.\n\nSo I cannot go to y=2 at t=9.\n\nI can stay at y=1 or go down to y=0.\n\nIf I stay at y=1 at t=9, safe, but then I need to go up later.\n\nIf I go down to y=0 at t=9, also safe, but worse.\n\nSo better to stay at y=1 at t=9.\n\nThen after t=9, I can go up.\n\nBut t=9 is late.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=8 and t=9, I am at y=1, I can go up at t=9 to y=2, but t=9 is dangerous for y=2, so I must not go up at t=9.\n\nAt turn t=8, I am at y=1, I take action a8.\n\nIf a8=U, then y9=2 at t=9, collision.\n\nIf a8=S, y9=1 at t=9, safe.\n\nIf a8=D, y9=0 at t=9, safe.\n\nSo to avoid collision at t=9, I cannot go U at t=8; I must do S or D.\n\nThen at t=9, y=1 or 0, safe.\n\nThen I can start going up from there.\n\nBut from y=1 at t=9, to y=9 at t=17 as before, slow.\n\nI can be higher before t=8.\n\nFor example, at t=7, instead of being at y=2, can I be higher?\n\nAt t=7, if I am at y=4, I can only go to 3,4,5, all dangerous at t=8.\n\nUnless I can be at y=1 at t=7, then I can stay or go down.\n\nBut y=1 at t=7 is safe.\n\nHow to be at y=1 at t=7.\n\nFrom start, at t=4, y=1.\n\nIf I stay at y=1 for some turns, but at t=6, I cannot be on y=1.\n\nSo I need to leave y=1 before t=6.\n\nFor example, at t=4, action S: stay at y=1 for t=5? a4=S, then y5=1 at t=5.\n\nThen at t=5, y=1, safe (row 1 at t=5 not dangerous).\n\nThen a5: I need to not be on y=1 at t=6.\n\nSo at t=5, I can go U to y=2 at t=6, or D to y=0 at t=6.\n\nIf go U to y=2 at t=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=6, y=2, I need to go to t=7.\n\nIf I want to be at y=1 at t=7, I can go D from y=2 to y=1 at t=7.\n\na6=D, y7=1 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, y=1, safe.\n\nThen for t=8, I can stay at y=1 by a7=S, so y8=1 at t=8, safe.\n\nSimilarly, for t=9, stay at y=1, a8=S, y9=1 at t=9, safe.\n\nThen from t=9, y=1, go up as before, reach y=9 at t=17.\n\nSame as before.\n\nFrom t=7, y=1, I can go up at t=7 to y=2 at t=8, but t=8 y=2 dangerous, so I cannot.\n\nI have to stay or go down at t=7 and t=8 actions to be safe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nBut it wastes time.\n\nTo reach faster, I need to be higher when I start going up after t=9.\n\nFor example, if at t=9, I am at y=1, I can only reach y=9 at t=17.\n\nBut if I can be at higher y at t=9, I can reach earlier.\n\nAt t=9, max possible y: from t=4, in 5 turns (t=5 to t=9), I can gain at most 5 in y, so y=1+5=6 at t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, if I am on y=6, and row 6 dangerous, collision.\n\nSimilarly, any y from 2-8 dangerous at t=9.\n\nSo I must be on y=0,1, or9 at t=9.\n\ny=9 not possible, so y=0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly at t=8, y=0 or 1.\n\nSo I must be at y<=1 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nThen from there, it takes at least 8 more turns to reach y=9.\n\nSince from y=1 at t=9, to y=9 at t=17, 8 actions.\n\nBut at t=4, I am at y=1, and I need to be at y=1 at t=9 for example, but with actions in between.\n\nIn the sequence where I go to y=2 and back, I was at y=1 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nt=8 and t=9 both at y=1.\n\nThen from t=9 to t=17, 8 turns to go up.\n\nBut t=9 to t=17 is 8 turns, after 8 actions from t=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=1, after 8 actions (a9 to a16), at t=17, y=9.\n\nBut I have actions from t=4 to t=8 as well.\n\nTotal actions from a4 to a16, 13 actions.\n\nMin possible is 8, but I can do better than 13.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at t=12 if I can avoid the danger at t=8 and t=9 without going down.\n\nBut at t=8, if I am at y=5 for example, collision, so I must not be on 2-8.\n\nUnless I am on a row that is not dangerous, but all 2-8 are dangerous at t=8 and t=9.\n\nOnly 1 and 0 safe.\n\nSo I must be on 0 or 1 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nThe earliest I can reach y=9 is after t=9, starting from y=1 at t=9, so at t=17.\n\nBut at t=9, if I am at y=0, it takes 9 actions to y=9, even later.\n\nSo min H is 13 with this approach.\n\nBut perhaps I can be on y=9 at t=12 if I am not on dangerous rows at t=8 and t=9, but to be at y=9 at t=12, I must be on some row at t=8 and t=9, which for t=8, I am at some y between, say at t=8, in all-U, y=5, dangerous.\n\nIf I go slower, at t=8, y<5, still dangerous if 2-8.\n\nOr if I go faster but I can't.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=0 at some point and wait, but that might not help.\n\nOr, for t=6, I can be on other rows.\n\nBut in this case, the constraint is t=8 and t=9.\n\nSince t=8 and t=9 are close, and I need to be low, perhaps I can go up to a high row before t=8, but then I have to come down to y=1 for t=8, which wastes time.\n\nFor example, at t=7, max y=4, if I am at y=4, I have to go down to y=1 for t=8, but from y=4 to y=1 takes 3 down actions, so at t=7 y=4, a7=D to y=3 at t=8, but y=3 dangerous, not good.\n\nTo be at y=1 at t=8, I need to be at y=2 at t=7, as before.\n\nAnd to be at y=2 at t=7, from start, I can go up to y=3 at t=6, then down to y=2 at t=7, as in the first sequence.\n\nOr, from start, go to y=2 at t=5, stay or something.\n\nBut I think 13 is the best I can do with this.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose I go up faster initially, but I can't.\n\nAt t=4, y=1\n\na4=U, t=5 y=2\n\na5=U, t=6 y=3\n\nNow at t=6, instead of going down, I go U to t=7 y=4\n\nThen at t=7 y=4, I have to deal with t=8.\n\nBut as before, I can only go to y=3,4,5 at t=8, all dangerous.\n\nIf I go D from y=4 to y=3 at t=8, collision.\n\nS, collision.\n\nU, collision.\n\nNo.\n\nUnless I can be at y=1 at t=8 from y=4 at t=7, impossible in one step.\n\nSo I must be at y=2 at t=7 to reach y=1 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly for other points.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=0 at t=8.\n\nFor example, at t=7, if I am at y=1, I can go D to y=0 at t=8.\n\nHow to be at y=1 at t=7.\n\nAs before, from start: t=4 y=1\n\na4=S, t=5 y=1\n\na5=U, t=6 y=2 (since not on y=1 at t=6)\n\nThen a6=D, t=7 y=1\n\nThen a7=D, t=8 y=0\n\nAt t=8, y=0, safe.\n\nThen for t=9, I can stay at y=0 or go to y=1.\n\na8=S, t=9 y=0, safe.\n\nOr a8=U, t=9 y=1, safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut at t=9, y=0 or 1, still low, so same as before, reach y=9 at t=17.\n\nWorse because I went to y=0.\n\nSo not better.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H might be 13 with the first sequence.\n\nBut let's see if I can start going up earlier or later.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=8 and t=9 I am at y=1, and I need to go up, but at t=9, I am at y=1, I can go U to y=2 at t=10, which is safe, as row 2 at t=10 not dangerous.\n\nThen I can go up continuously from there.\n\nBut from y=1 at t=9 to y=9 at t=17, 8 turns.\n\nBut the turns from t=4 to t=8 are used to maintain low position.\n\nTotal turns from t=4 to t=17, 13 actions.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach y=9 in fewer than 13 actions by being higher at some point.\n\nFor example, if at t=7, I am at y=4, but then I have to go down for t=8, which costs actions.\n\nSuppose at t=7, y=4, then to be safe at t=8, I need to go to y=1, but I can only go to y=3 at t=8, which is dangerous, so I cannot.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=9 at t=12 if I can avoid being on 2-8 at t=8 and t=9, but to be at y=9 at t=12, at t=8 I must be at y=5 or something, which is on 2-8, dangerous.\n\nUnless I am not on the grid or something, but I have to be on some y.\n\nThe only way is to be on y=0 or 1 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSo I think 13 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's check the car on row 1 at t=6.\n\nIn the sequence, when I was at y=3 at t=6, safe.\n\nBut is there a way to be higher at t=7.\n\nFor example, from t=4, go U to y=2 at t=5\n\nThen at t=5, go U to y=3 at t=6\n\nThen at t=6, go U to y=4 at t=7\n\nThen at t=7, y=4, I am stuck for t=8.\n\nUnless I do something else.\n\nPerhaps for t=9, I can be on y=9, but impossible.\n\nOr, I can go to y=9 after t=9.\n\nBut let's calculate the minimal H.\n\nSince I must be at y<=1 at t=8 and t=9, and at t=4 I am at y=1, the net change from t=4 to t=9 is 0 or negative, so I have to make up for it later.\n\nFrom t=4 to t=9, 5 turns (t=5 to t=9 are 5 positions, but actions from a4 to a8 determine y5 to y9.\n\ny at t=4 is given, y4=1.\n\nAfter actions a4 to a8, at t=9, y9.\n\nI need y9 <=1 for safety, since if y9=2-8, dangerous at t=9.\n\ny9 must be 0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, y8 must be 0 or 1.\n\nNow, from y4=1 to y9=0 or 1, the sum of Δy from a4 to a8 must be <=0.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y9=9 eventually, I need to have positive sum later.\n\nBut the actions to stay low cost me.\n\nThe number of actions to go from y=1 to y=9 is at least 8, but with the constraint that at t=8 and t=9, y<=1, so I must have some down or stay actions between t=4 and t=8 to keep y low.\n\nIn particular, from t=4 to t=8, y8 must be 0 or 1, so from y4=1, sum of Δy from a4 to a7 (since a7 determines y8) must be <=0.\n\nSimilarly for t=9.\n\nBut let's not complicate.\n\nI think H=13 is achievable and likely minimal.\n\nBut let's see if I can do with less.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=3 at t=6 as before.\n\nThen at t=6, instead of going down, I go up to y=4 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, I go down to y=3 at t=8, but y=3 at t=8 dangerous.\n\nGo down to y=2 at t=8, dangerous.\n\nNo.\n\nAt t=7, y=4, I go S to y=4 at t=8, dangerous.\n\nNo way.\n\nSo I must be at y=2 at t=7 to go to y=1 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, for t=9, I stay at y=1.\n\nThen from t=9, I go up.\n\nBut at t=9, y=1, I can go U immediately to y=2 at t=10, safe.\n\nThen U to y=3 at t=11, safe, and so on, up to y=9 at t=17.\n\nTo save one action, at t=8, when I am at y=1, instead of staying at t=9, I can go up at t=8 to y=2, but t=9 y=2 dangerous, so I cannot.\n\nUnless I go up at t=9, but t=9 I am at y=1, if I go U, to y=2 at t=10, not at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, I am at y=1, safe.\n\nAction a9=U, to y=2 at t=10.\n\nNo collision at t=10.\n\nSo I think 13 is the best.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at t=12 if I am not on the grid at t=8 and t=9, but I have to be on some y.\n\nAnother thought: the collision only happens if I am on the freeway when car is at 0, but if I am on y=0 or y=9, no freeway, so safe.\n\nBut I can't be elsewhere.\n\nSo I think H=13 is the answer.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nTurn t1=4: a4 = U  (to y=2 at t=5)\n\nTurn t1+1=5: a5 = U  (to y=3 at t=6)\n\nTurn t1+2=6: a6 = D  (to y=2 at t=7)  // t1+2 is t=6, action a6 determines y7\n\nTurn t1+3=7: a7 = D  (to y=1 at t=8)\n\nTurn t1+4=8: a8 = S  (to y=1 at t=9)  // stay at y=1\n\nTurn t1+5=9: a9 = U  (to y=2 at t=10)\n\nTurn t1+6=10: a10 = U  (to y=3 at t=11)\n\nTurn t1+7=11: a11 = U  (to y=4 at t=12)\n\nTurn t1+8=12: a12 = U  (to y=5 at t=13)\n\nTurn t1+9=13: a13 = U  (to y=6 at t=14)\n\nTurn t1+10=14: a14 = U  (to y=7 at t=15)\n\nTurn t1+11=15: a15 = U  (to y=8 at t=16)\n\nTurn t1+12=16: a16 = U  (to y=9 at t=17)\n\nAfter a16, at t=17, y=9.\n\nH=13 actions.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from a4 to a16, that's 13 actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be the actions starting from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, so a4 to a16 for H=13.\n\nt1 + H-1 = 4 + 12 = 16, yes.\n\nNow, in the sequence, at t=6, I did a6=D, from y=3 to y=2.\n\nBut is there a way to have fewer downs?\n\nFor example, if at t=6, I go S to y=3 at t=7, but then I can't reach y=1 at t=8.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to y=1 at t=7 from lower.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nSince at t=8 and t=9 I need to be low, and at t=6 I need to not be on y=1, I can be on y=0 at t=6.\n\nFor example, at t=5, from y=2, I can go D to y=1 at t=6, but y=1 at t=6 dangerous, so cannot.\n\nAt t=5, y=2, I can go D to y=1 at t=6, but collision at t=6 on y=1.\n\nSo I must not be on y=1 at t=6.\n\nIn the sequence, by being at y=3 at t=6, safe.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 13 with the above sequence.\n\nBut let's confirm the car at t=6 on row 1.\n\nAt t=6, for row 1, car covers 0, so if on y=1, collision.\n\nIn sequence, not on y=1.\n\nAt t=8, on y=1, safe.\n\nAt t=9, on y=1, safe.\n\nThen up.\n\nNow, in the answer format, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut the player position is given as (0,y), and we move in y, x=0 always.\n\nThe actions are U, D, S.\n\nIn the sequence, I have a4=U, a5=U, a6=D, a7=D, a8=S, a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U, a14=U, a15=U, a16=U.\n\nBut from a9 to a16 all U except a8=S.\n\na8=S.\n\nNow, H=13.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=12?\n\nSuppose I reach y=9 at t=16.\n\nFor example, if at t=9, I am at y=2, but at t=9, if on y=2, collision, so I cannot be on y=2 at t=9.\n\nMust be <=1.\n\nSo impossible to be higher at t=9.\n\nThus, min H=13.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=1 at t=8 and then at t=9 go directly to higher, but no, each step +1.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 13. The sequence of actions is designed to avoid dangerous rows at critical turns:\n\n- At turn \\(t = 6\\) (relative turn \\(k = 2\\)), row \\(y = 1\\) is dangerous because a car covers position 0. The player must not be on row 1 at this turn.\n- At turns \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\) (relative turns \\(k = 4\\) and \\(k = 5\\)), rows \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are dangerous because cars cover position 0 on these rows. The player must be on row 0, 1, or 9 at these turns to avoid collision. Since row 9 is not reachable by \\(t = 8\\) or \\(t = 9\\), the player must be on row 0 or 1.\n\nThe sequence starts by moving up to row 3 by turn 6 to avoid the danger on row 1. Then, it moves down to row 2 at turn 7 and to row 1 at turn 8 to be safe for turn 8. The player stays on row 1 at turn 9 to remain safe. From turn 10 onwards, the player moves up continuously to reach row 9 by turn 17.\n\nThe actions are as follows, with \\(H = 13\\) actions from turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 16\\):\n\n- Turn 4: Move up (U) to reach row 2 at turn 5 (safe, as row 2 is not dangerous at turn 5).\n- Turn 5: Move up (U) to reach row 3 at turn 6 (safe, as row 3 is not dangerous at turn 6).\n- Turn 6: Move down (D) to reach row 2 at turn 7 (safe, as row 2 is not dangerous at turn 7).\n- Turn 7: Move down (D) to reach row 1 at turn 8 (safe, as row 1 is not dangerous at turn 8).\n- Turn 8: Stay (S) to remain on row 1 at turn 9 (safe, as row 1 is not dangerous at turn 9).\n- Turn 9: Move up (U) to reach row 2 at turn 10 (safe, as row 2 is not dangerous at turn 10).\n- Turn 10: Move up (U) to reach row 3 at turn 11 (safe, as row 3 is not dangerous at turn 11).\n- Turn 11: Move up (U) to reach row 4 at turn 12 (safe, as row 4 is not dangerous at turn 12).\n- Turn 12: Move up (U) to reach row 5 at turn 13 (safe, as row 5 is not dangerous at turn 13).\n- Turn 13: Move up (U) to reach row 6 at turn 14 (safe, as row 6 is not dangerous at turn 14).\n- Turn 14: Move up (U) to reach row 7 at turn 15 (safe, as row 7 is not dangerous at turn 15).\n- Turn 15: Move up (U) to reach row 8 at turn 16 (safe, as row 8 is not dangerous at turn 16).\n- Turn 16: Move up (U) to reach row 9 at turn 17 (goal, safe as row 9 has no cars).\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions:\n- At turn 6, the player is on row 3, avoiding the danger on row 1.\n- At turns 8 and 9, the player is on row 1, which is safe.\n- The player reaches row 9 at turn 17 after 13 actions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U }",

The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway from y=1 to y=8. For each car, I have its position at turn t1=5, given by head and tail, and its direction and speed. The car spans move left or right based on the direction.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn T. Importantly, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So if at turn T, they move from y to y+1, at turn T they are still on y, and at turn T+1 they are on y+1. So for collision, we care about the y-position at the start of the turn when we choose the action.\n\nThe action is chosen at turn t, and then the position updates for turn t+1. Let me read the dynamics carefully.\n\n\"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t\"\n\nSo at turn t, we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen for collision: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T, I think. y_T is defined as the position at turn T.\n\nAlso, note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThis means that at turn T, you are on y_T, so you only check for collision on freeway y_T at turn T. When you move, at turn T, you are still on the old y, and you move to new y at turn T+1.\n\nSo, for collision detection at turn T, we look at y_T and the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, for cars, the span at turn T is given based on t1.\n\nt1 is the current turn, which is 5.\n\nSo for any future turn T, the span of a car is computed from its state at t1.\n\nLet me denote the time offset. Let τ = T - t1, so τ is the number of turns after t1.\n\nAt time T = t1 + τ, the span for a left-moving car: Span(T) = [h - s * τ, τ - s * τ]? Let's see the notation.\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the text, it says \"tail is at τ\", but τ is used for time offset, confusing. In the car state, it says \"head h, tail τ\", so τ is the tail position.\n\nBut in the update, for left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\n\nAnd collision if 0 is in Span(T) for the car on freeway y_T.\n\ny_T is the player's y-position at turn T.\n\nNow, the player starts at y = 2 at t1=5.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H is the number of actions, I think. H turns including the starting point? Let's see.\n\n\"sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\" and y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9? Let's read.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t1 + H, the position is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut it says y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nLet's clarify the indexing.\n\nAt turn t1, position is given as (0, y_{t1}) = (0,2)\n\nThen we choose action a_{t1}, which determines y_{t1+1}.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, we choose a_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, we are at turn t1 + k, position y_{t1+k}.\n\nWe want to reach position y = 9 at some turn.\n\nIt says: \"reach (0,9)\" and \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} = 9 means that at turn t1 + H - 1, the position is 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1, meaning a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H - 1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H - 1}, at turn t1 + H, position is y_{t1 + H}, but we set y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nAt turn t, before action, position is y_t.\n\nAfter choosing a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nThen at turn t+1, position is y_{t+1}, and we choose a_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nThe position y_t is at the beginning of turn t, I believe.\n\nThen at turn t, we choose a_t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on y_T and the cars at that turn.\n\nFor the goal, we want y_T = 9 for some T, with minimal T - t1, I think, but H is the number of turns, which might include the starting turn or not.\n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAlso, the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1: a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter these H actions, the position at turn t1 + H is y_{t1 + H}, but we have y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nAt turn t1 + H - 1, position is y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9, which means that we reached y=9 at that turn, so we don't need to move further.\n\nThe actions are chosen from t1 to t1+H-1, and after H actions, at time t1+H, we are not moving, I think.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nAt turn t1, position y_t1 = 2.\n\nWe choose a_t1, which sets y_{t1+1}.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}, choose a_{t1+1}, sets y_{t1+2}, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions (from t1 to t1+k-1), we are at turn t1+k, position y_{t1+k}.\n\nWe want y_T = 9 for some T, and H is such that T = t1 + H - 1, so H-1 actions? Messy.\n\nThe sequence has H actions: a_t1 to a_t1+H-1.\n\nAfter these, the position at turn t1+H is y_t1+H.\n\nBut the goal is y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9, which means that at turn t1+H-1, position is 9, so the last action a_t1+H-1 is chosen such that it keeps y at 9 or moves to it, but since we want to be at 9, and we stop when we reach.\n\nIn the action sequence, we include actions until we reach y=9.\n\nFor example, if at turn T, y_T = 9, then we don't need to choose an action for that turn; we are already there.\n\nBut in the sequence, we are choosing actions to move to the position.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that at each turn, we choose an action, and the position updates at the end of the turn.\n\nThen, at the turn when we first reach y=9, we stop.\n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\", and actions from t=0 to H-1 for the sequence.\n\nI think H is the number of actions taken, and we reach at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nFor example, if no action is needed, but we are at y=2, not 9, so we need actions.\n\nMinimal H such that after H-1 actions, we are at y=9? Let's see the index.\n\nSet τ = 0 at t1.\n\nAt τ=0, turn t1, position y=2.\n\nWe choose action a0 for this turn, which sets y1.\n\nThen at τ=1, turn t1+1, position y1, choose a1, sets y2, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, we have y_k.\n\nWe want y_k = 9 for some k, with minimal k.\n\nThen H = k+1? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so t from 0 to H-1, H actions.\n\nThen y_{t1 + H} is the position after H actions, but we want y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions at t1 only, then y_{t1} should be 9, but it's 2, not 9.\n\nAfter a_t1, y_{t1+1} is set.\n\nIf at τ=0, we choose a0, then at τ=1, y1 is set.\n\nIf y1 = 9, then at turn t1+1, position is 9.\n\nIn this case, for H=1, we have one action at t1, and y_{t1+1} = 9, but the goal is y_{t1 + H - 1} = y_{t1 +1 -1} = y_t1 =2, not 9. Confusion.\n\nLet's read the problem: \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAnd \"sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\"\n\nFor t=0, a_t1, for t=1, a_t1+1, ..., for t=H-1, a_t1+H-1.\n\nAfter choosing a_t1+H-1, y_{t1+H} is set.\n\nBut we have y_{t1+H-1} = 9, which is the position before choosing a_t1+H-1 or after previous action.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t is known, then we choose a_t, which determines y_t+1.\n\nThen at turn t+1, position is y_t+1, and so on.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nWe want y_T = 9 for some T.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from turn t1 to turn t1 + H - 1, so H actions.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H, position y_t1+H is set by the last action.\n\nBut the goal is that at turn t1 + H - 1, y_t1+H-1 = 9.\n\nThat means that at turn t1 + H - 1, we are already at 9, and we choose action a_t1+H-1, which might move us away, but since we want to be at 9 at that turn, we should choose S or something.\n\nThe minimal H such that we can be at y=9 at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nFor example, if we start at y=2, to reach y=9, we need to increase y by 7, so minimal actions if we move up each time, but with cars, we might need to wait.\n\nBut with the position, at turn t1, y=2, after one up action, at turn t1+1, y=3, and so on.\n\nAfter 7 up actions, at turn t1+7, y=9.\n\nSo at turn t1+7, y=9, which is turn t1 + H - 1 for H-1 =7, so H=8.\n\nLet's set k = T - t1, the number of turns after t1.\n\nAt k=0, turn t1, y=2.\n\nAfter action a_t1, at k=1, turn t1+1, y= y2 or y_t1+1.\n\nPosition at time t: y_t.\n\nAt t=t1, y_t1 =2.\n\nChoose a_t1, set y_t1+1.\n\nAt t=t1+1, position y_t1+1, choose a_t1+1, set y_t1+2, and so on.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nWe want y_T = 9 for some T >= t1.\n\nLet T = t1 + M for some M >=0.\n\nIf M=0, y_t1=2!=9, so M>0.\n\nThen after M actions from t1 to t1+M-1, we set y_t1+M =9.\n\nThen the number of actions is M, and T = t1 + M.\n\nThe problem says y_{t1 + H - 1} =9, so t1 + H -1 = T = t1 + M, so H-1 = M, thus H = M+1.\n\nNumber of actions is M, but H = M+1.\n\nFor example, to go from y=2 to y=9, with all U, actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+6, 7 actions, then at t1+7, y=9.\n\nSo T = t1+7, M=7 actions.\n\nThen y_{t1+7} =9.\n\nBut the problem wants y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so t1+H-1 = t1+7, thus H-1=7, H=8.\n\nAnd the sequence has H actions from t=0 to H-1, so a_t1 to a_t1+7 for H=8, but a_t1+7 is the action at turn t1+7, which sets y_t1+8, but we are at y_t1+7=9, so if we choose a_t1+7, it might change position, but the goal is to be at 9 at turn t1+7, so we should not choose an action for that turn if we are already there, but the sequence includes it.\n\nPerhaps for the turn when we reach, we choose S or something.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t1 + H -1, we choose an action that keeps us at 9 or moves to it, but since we are at 9 at the start, we can choose S.\n\nLet's assume that we include actions until the turn before we reach, but the problem says the sequence includes actions until we have y=9 at that turn.\n\nI think it's safer to follow the problem: we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9, and we have H actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nFor the action at t1+H-1, if y_{t1+H-1} =9, we can choose S to stay, or if we reach it with the action.\n\nIn practice, for the last action, if we are at 8, we choose U to go to 9 at next turn, but then y_{t1+H} =9, but we want y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nSo to have y_{t1+H-1} =9, it means that at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9, so we choose S to stay at 9 for the next turn, but the position doesn't change.\n\nThen at turn t1+H-1, y=9, and we choose S, so y_{t1+H} =9 still.\n\nBut the goal is to reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nFor the car collision, we need to ensure that at each turn from t1 to t1+H-1, when we are on a freeway, there is no car at x=0 on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSince the player is at x=0 always, I assume, as position is (0,y).\n\nNow, freeways are from y=1 to 8, so when y_t = k for k=1 to 8, we need to check for cars on freeway k at turn t.\n\nAt y=0 or y=9, no cars, so no collision possible.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2, which is freeway 2, so we need to check for cars at turn t1=5 on freeway 2.\n\nBut at turn t1, we are at y=2, and we choose action, so for collision at turn t, it is based on y_t.\n\nAt turn t1, y_t1=2, so we need to check if there is a car on freeway 2 at turn t1 with 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly for other turns.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars at t1=5.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head -12, tail -23, direction right, speed 12.\n\nSince direction right, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-23, -12]? Let's see the notation.\n\n\" for car k, head h, tail τ\"\n\nThen for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and \"Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] and Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\n\nIn this case, all cars are given with their state at t1.\n\nFreeway 1: car: h=-12, τ=-23, d=right, s=12\n\nSpan at t1: since right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nAt time T, Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)] = [-23 + 12(T-5), -12 + 12(T-5)]\n\nCollision if 0 in Span(T) for freeway y_T.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: car: h=-18, τ=-29, d=right, s=6\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-29, -18]\n\nSpan(T) = [-29 + 6(T-5), -18 + 6(T-5)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? \"3 | (−18,−29,right,6)\" so same as 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (−18,−29,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: same, (−18,−29,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: same, (−18,−29,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (−18,−29,right,6), (18,7,right,6), (54,43,right,6)\n\nFor each car, separately.\n\nFirst car: h=-18, τ=-29, d=right, s=6, Span(T) = [-29 +6(T-5), -18 +6(T-5)]\n\nSecond car: h=18, τ=7, d=right, s=6, Span(T) = [7 +6(T-5), 18 +6(T-5)]\n\nThird car: h=54, τ=43, d=right, s=6, Span(T) = [43 +6(T-5), 54 +6(T-5)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as 7, three cars with same parameters.\n\nNow, for collision on freeway k at turn T, we need that for any car on that freeway, 0 is in its Span(T).\n\nWe want to avoid that.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at t1=5.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, which is above, so moving up is natural, but we have to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each future turn, when there is a car at x=0.\n\nSince the player moves one step at a time, we can think of the path.\n\nMinimal steps to move from y=2 to y=9 is 7 steps up, but we may need to wait or move down to avoid cars.\n\nSince going down might not help, and we need to go up, probably we only move up or stay, but staying might be necessary to wait for a car to pass.\n\nMoving down to y=0 or below is not possible, y=0 is safe, but it might waste time.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 is safe.\n\nSo let's compute for each freeway the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nDefine τ = T - t1, so at τ=0, T=t1=5.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, Span(T) = [-23 + 12(τ), -12 + 12(τ)] where τ = T-5\n\n0 in span if -23 +12τ <= 0 <= -12 +12τ\n\nSo -23 +12τ <= 0 and 0 <= -12 +12τ\n\nFirst inequality: -23 +12τ <=0 => 12τ <=23 => τ <= 23/12 = 1.916, so τ <=1 since τ integer\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -12 +12τ => 12τ >=12 => τ >=1\n\nSo for τ=1, both: τ>=1 and τ<=1.916, so τ=1\n\nFor τ=1, T=6, 0 in [-23+12= -11, -12+12=0], so -11 <=0<=0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nFor τ=0, T=5: [-23, -12], 0 not in.\n\nτ=2: [-23+24=1, -12+24=12], 1 to 12, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at τ=1, T=6, freeway 1 has a car at x=0.\n\nFor freeway 2: car Span(T) = [-29 +6τ, -18 +6τ]\n\n0 in if -29 +6τ <=0 <= -18 +6τ\n\nFirst: -29+6τ <=0 => 6τ <=29 => τ <=29/6=4.833, τ<=4\n\nSecond: 0 <= -18 +6τ => 6τ >=18 => τ>=3\n\nSo τ=3,4\n\nFor τ=3, T=8: [-29+18= -11, -18+18=0], -11<=0<=0, yes\n\nτ=4, T=9: [-29+24= -5, -18+24=6], -5<=0<=6, yes\n\nτ=5: [-29+30=1, -18+30=12], 1 to 12, 0 not in\n\nSo occupied at T=8 and T=9\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as 2, occupied at T=8,9\n\nFreeway 4: same, T=8,9\n\nFreeway 5: same, T=8,9\n\nFreeway 6: same, T=8,9\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: same as above, Span(T) = [-29+6τ, -18+6τ], occupied at τ=3,4 (T=8,9)\n\nSecond car: h=18, τ=7, d=right, s=6\n\nSpan(T) = [7 +6τ, 18 +6τ]\n\n0 in if 7+6τ <=0 <=18+6τ\n\nBut 7+6τ <=0? 6τ <= -7, impossible since τ>=0, 7+6τ >=7>0, so left end >0, 0 not <= left end, so 0 never in span for this car.\n\nSimilarly, third car: h=54, τ=43, d=right, s=6\n\nSpan(T) = [43+6τ, 54+6τ], both ends positive for τ>=0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSo for freeway 7, only the first car matters, occupied at τ=3,4 (T=8,9)\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same as 7, occupied at T=8,9.\n\nNow, freeway 1 is occupied only at T=6 (τ=1)\n\nFreeways 2 to 8 are all occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeways 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 all have cars at x=0 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow, player at t1=5, τ=0, T=5, y=2.\n\nFreeway 2 is occupied? At T=5, freeway 2: Span(5) = [-29, -18] for τ=0, not include 0, so safe.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nThe direct path: move up each turn.\n\nBut let's see the turns.\n\nAt T=5, y=2, choose action.\n\nIf we choose U, then y6 =3\n\nAt T=6, y=3, but freeway 1 is occupied at T=6, but y=3, which is freeway 3? Freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, y=2 freeway 2, etc.\n\nAt T=6, if y=3, freeway 3.\n\nBut freeway 3 is not occupied at T=6, only at T=8,9.\n\nAt T=6, freeway 1 is occupied, but we are on y=3, freeway 3, so no collision.\n\nNow, continue: at T=6, y=3, choose U, y7=4\n\nT=7, y=4, choose U, y8=5\n\nAt T=8, y=5, freeway 5 is occupied at T=8, so collision! Because 0 in car span on freeway 5 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, if we go straight up:\n\nT=5: y=2, action U, y6=3\n\nT=6: y=3, action U, y7=4\n\nT=7: y=4, action U, y8=5\n\nT=8: y=5, on freeway 5, occupied, collision.\n\nIf we go to y=6 at T=8, y8=6, freeway 6 occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 or 8, all occupied at T=8.\n\ny=1 to 8 all have issues at T=8 and T=9 except freeway 1, but freeway 1 only at T=6.\n\nAt T=8 and T=9, all freeways y=2 to 8 are occupied, as per above.\n\nFreeway 1 is only occupied at T=6.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nTo avoid collision at T=8 and T=9, we cannot be on any freeway y=1 to 8 at those turns.\n\nSo we need to be at y=0 or y=9 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut at T=8, if we are at y=9, good, or y=0.\n\nSimilarly for T=9.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at T=5.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 by some turn.\n\nMinimal time: if no cars, we can be at y=9 at T=5+7=12? T=5, y=2; after U at T=5, y6=3; ... after U at T=11, y12=9.\n\nT=5: y=2\n\nAfter action at T=5: y6=3\n\nT=6: y=3, action U, y7=4\n\nT=7: y=4, action U, y8=5\n\nBut at T=8, y=5, collision.\n\nTo avoid, we need not to be on freeway at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSo possible to be at y=0 at T=8 and T=9, or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, so better to be at y=9 earlier if possible.\n\nSince at T=8 and T=9, all freeways occupied, we must be at y=0 or y=9 at those turns.\n\ny=9 is the target, so we can aim to be at y=9 by T=8 or earlier.\n\nBut at T=5, y=2, to reach y=9 in 3 turns? From T=5 to T=8, 3 actions.\n\nAfter 3 actions: from y=2, if all U, y8=5, not 9.\n\nMax we can go: from y=2, with U,U,U, to y=5 at T=8.\n\nBut y=5 is on freeway, collision.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need at least 7 steps up, so minimal at T=12 as above.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, we need to be safe, so we must be at y=0 or y=9 at those turns.\n\nSince y=9 is the goal, we can be at y=9 at T=8 or later.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at T=8, from T=5 y=2, we need to go up 7 steps in 3 actions? Impossible, since each action moves at most one step.\n\nIn 3 actions, we can reach at most y=5.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=9 at T=9, from T=5 to T=9, 4 actions: y5=2, after a5, y6; after a6, y7; after a7, y8; after a8, y9.\n\nAt T=9, y9, if y9=9, safe.\n\nBut during the path, we need to avoid collision at each turn.\n\nSpecifically, at T=8, we have y8, which must be safe, so y8=0 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, y9=9 for goal.\n\nBut y9=9 is the position at T=9.\n\nNow, from y=2 at T=5, to y9=9 at T=9, we have 4 actions: at T=5,6,7,8.\n\nAfter 4 actions, y9 is set.\n\ny9 can be 9.\n\nBut at T=8, we need y8 safe, so y8=0 or 9.\n\nIf we go directly, with U each time: a5=U, y6=3; a6=U, y7=4; a7=U, y8=5; a8=U, y9=6. Not 9, and y8=5 collision.\n\nTo reach y9=9, we need to move up 7 steps in 4 actions, so we need to move up every time, but y increases only one per action, so from y5=2, after 4 actions, y9 can be at most 6, since y6=3, y7=4, y8=5, y9=6. We cannot reach y=9 in 4 actions from y=2.\n\nNumber of turns: from T=5 to T=9, there are 4 actions: at T=5,6,7,8, setting y6,y7,y8,y9.\n\ny5=2 given.\n\ny6 = y5 + Δy5\n\ny7 = y6 + Δy6\n\ny8 = y7 + Δy7\n\ny9 = y8 + Δy8\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}\n\nTo have y9=9, we need y5 + Δy5 + Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8 = 9\n\ny5=2, so Δy5 + Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8 =7\n\nSince each <=1, must all be +1, so U each action.\n\nThen y6=3, y7=4, y8=5, y9=6, but we want y9=9, contradiction, 6<9.\n\nImpossible to reach y=9 at T=9 with actions from T=5 to T=8.\n\ny9 is set by action at T=8.\n\nWith one action, we can increase by at most 1, so from y8, y9 <= y8 +1.\n\nSimilarly, from y5=2, after k actions, y_{5+k} <= 2+k.\n\nTo have y_{5+k} =9, need 2+k >=9, k>=7.\n\nSo earliest at T=5+7=12, y12=9.\n\nAt T=12, position y=9, safe.\n\nBut at intermediate turns, we need to avoid collision, especially at T=8 and T=9.\n\nAt T=8 and T=9, we must not be on freeway, so y8 must be 0 or 9, but at T=8, y8 cannot be 9 because to reach y9=9 at T=12, y8 at T=8 is at most, if we move fast, y8=2+3=5 if actions at T=5,6,7, but y8=5 as above.\n\ny8 <= y5 + 3 =5, since 3 actions from T=5 to T=7 set y8? Actions: a5 sets y6, a6 sets y7, a7 sets y8.\n\nSo after 3 actions (a5,a6,a7), y8 is set.\n\ny8 <= 2 +3 =5.\n\nSimilarly, y9 <= y8 +1 <=6.\n\ny10 <= y9 +1 <=7, etc.\n\nTo have y12=9, we need 7 up moves in 7 actions from T=5 to T=11.\n\ny12 is set by a11.\n\nNow, at T=8, y8 must be 0 or 9 for safety, but y8 <=5 <9, so must be 0.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, y9 must be 0 or 9, y9 <=6<9, so must be 0.\n\nThen at T=10 and T=11, we can move up to y=9.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, no cars.\n\nSo we need to be at y=0 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nNow, from current position y=2 at T=5, we need to go down to y=0 by T=8.\n\nT=8 is in 3 turns? From T=5 to T=8.\n\nAt T=5, y=2.\n\nWe can move down.\n\nEach down move decreases y by 1.\n\ny must be >=0.\n\nTo be at y=0 at T=8.\n\nT=8 is the time when position is y8.\n\nWe need y8=0.\n\nNow, y8 is set by actions from T=5 to T=7.\n\nSpecifically, a5 sets y6, a6 sets y7, a7 sets y8.\n\nFrom y5=2, to y8=0, we need to decrease by 2 in 3 actions.\n\nPossible, for example, down at some points.\n\nThen at T=8, y=0, safe.\n\nAt T=9, we need y9=0 or 9.\n\nIf y8=0, we can choose S to stay at 0, so y9=0.\n\nThen at T=9, y=0, safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up to y=9.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9, so after T=9, we move up.\n\nNow, let's outline the plan.\n\nFirst, get to y=0 by T=8.\n\nThen stay at T=9 to be safe at T=9.\n\nThen go up to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nNow, from T=5 to T=8: 3 actions to go from y=2 to y=0.\n\nDecrease by 2, so we can have two down moves and one stay, or one down and two stays, etc., but since we need to be at 0 at T=8, and we can have stays.\n\nMinimal actions, but we have time, so we can use down moves.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt T=5: y=2, choose D, so y6=1\n\nAt T=6: y=1, which is freeway 1, and at T=6, freeway 1 is occupied! We forgot that.\n\nAt T=6, freeway 1 has a car at x=0.\n\nSo if we are on y=1 at T=6, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt T=6, if y=1, we are on freeway 1, and occupied, collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=1 at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, we need to avoid that.\n\nAt T=5, y=2.\n\nIf we choose D, y6=1, but at T=6, y=1, collision.\n\nIf we choose S, y6=2, then at T=6, y=2, freeway 2.\n\nAt T=6, is freeway 2 occupied? Freeway 2 occupied at T=8 and T=9, not at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, freeway 2: Span(T=6) = for τ=1, T=6, τ=T-5=1\n\nSpan= [-29 +6(1), -18 +6(1)] = [-23, -12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways not occupied except freeway 1 at T=6.\n\nSo at T=6, only freeway 1 is dangerous.\n\nIf we are on y=1 at T=6, collision.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nBack to plan.\n\nWe need y8=0 and y9=0.\n\nTo reach y=0 from y=2 in steps.\n\nBut we cannot be at y=1 at T=6.\n\nPossible actions:\n\nAt T=5, y=2.\n\nOption: choose U, then y6=3, which is freeway 3, safe at T=6.\n\nThen at T=6, y=3, we can choose D, to y7=2.\n\nThen at T=7, y=2, choose D, to y8=1? But y8=1 at T=8, but at T=8, freeway 1 is not occupied? Freeway 1 occupied only at T=6, not at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, freeway 1: Span(T=8) = for τ=3, [-23+12*3= -23+36=13, -12+36=24], 13 to 24, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, only freeways 2-8 occupied at T=8.\n\nSo y=1 at T=8 is safe, since freeway 1 not occupied.\n\nBut we need y8=0 for safety at T=8? Earlier I said to be safe at T=8, y must be 0 or 9, but y=1 is freeway 1, which is not occupied at T=8, so it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, freeway 1 not occupied.\n\nOnly freeways 2-8 are occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway 1 is safe except at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nSo at T=8 and T=9, we can be on y=0,1,9 or any y not 2-8.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, but at T=8 and T=9, freeway 1 is not occupied, so safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 also safe.\n\nSo to avoid collision at T=8 and T=9, we must not be on y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nWe can be on y=0,1, or 9.\n\nSimilarly, at other times, we need to avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 eventually.\n\nMinimal time: with no delays, at T=12, y=9.\n\nBut we may need to adjust for T=8 and T=9.\n\nSince at T=8 and T=9, we must be on y=0,1, or 9.\n\nBut y=9 might not be reachable by then.\n\ny=1 is possible.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nBut let's see the path from T=5 to T=12.\n\nList the turns: T=5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12\n\nAt each turn, position y_T, and we choose action a_T.\n\ny_T must be safe, meaning if y_T between 1 and 8, no car on that freeway at T with 0 in span.\n\nWe know the dangerous times:\n\n- At T=6, only y=1 is dangerous (freeway 1 occupied)\n\n- At T=8, y=2 to 8 dangerous (freeways 2-8 occupied)\n\n- At T=9, y=2 to 8 dangerous\n\nAt other times, all freeways are safe, since no cars at x=0 except those times.\n\nFor example, T=5: all freeways safe, as we saw.\n\nT=7: let's check, for any freeway.\n\nAt T=7, τ=2.\n\nFreeway 1: Span= [-23+24=1, -12+24=12], 1 to 12, 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 2: Span= [-29+12= -17, -18+12= -6], -17 to -6, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly all others, not occupied except at specific times.\n\nSo only need to worry about T=6, T=8, T=9.\n\nAt T=6, avoid y=1.\n\nAt T=8 and T=9, avoid y=2 to 8.\n\nNow, we start at T=5, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 by T=12, for example.\n\nActions at T=5 to T=11.\n\nNow, constraints:\n\nAt T=6: y6 cannot be 1.\n\ny6 is set by a5.\n\ny5=2, so y6 = 2 + Δy5, with Δy5 in {-1,0,1}\n\nIf y6=1, which is if a5=D, then y6=1, but at T=6, collision.\n\nSo we must not choose D at T=5, so y6 cannot be 1.\n\nThus a5 cannot be D, so a5 must be U or S, so y6=3 or 2.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, y8 must not be in 2-8, so y8 must be 0,1, or 9.\n\nBut y8 <= y5 + 3 =5 <9, so y8=0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, y9 must be 0,1, or 9.\n\ny9 <= y8 +1 <= 1+1=2 or 0+1=1, so y9 <=2 <9, so y9=0 or 1.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 later, so we have to go up after.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nEarliest is T=12 with y12=9.\n\nNow, we need to set y8 and y9 to safe values.\n\ny8 must be 0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly y9=0 or 1.\n\nSince y9 = y8 + Δy8, if y8=0, y9=0 or 1; if y8=1, y9=0,1,2.\n\nBut y9 must be 0 or 1, so if y8=1, y9 cannot be 2, must be 0 or 1.\n\nNow, from T=5, y=2.\n\nWe need to get to y8=0 or 1.\n\ny8 is after 3 actions: a5,a6,a7.\n\ny8 = y5 + Δy5 + Δy6 + Δy7\n\nSince y5=2, and Δy <=1 each, y8 <=5, and to be 0 or 1, we need to decrease or stay low.\n\nSpecifically, the sum of changes from T=5 to T=7 must be -2, -1, or -3? y8 = 2 + Δy5 + Δy6 + Δy7\n\nSet S = Δy5 + Δy6 + Δy7\n\nThen y8 = 2 + S\n\nWe need y8 <=1 and >=0, so 2 + S <=1 => S <= -1, and 2 + S >=0 => S >= -2.\n\nSo S = -1 or -2.\n\nThat is, net change -1 or -2 in three actions.\n\nSimilarly, for y9 = y8 + Δy8\n\ny9 must be 0 or 1.\n\nNow, also, at T=6, y6 must not be 1.\n\ny6 = 2 + Δy5\n\nIf Δy5 = -1, y6=1, forbidden.\n\nSo Δy5 != -1, so y6 !=1.\n\nThus Δy5 = 0 or 1, so y6 = 2 or 3.\n\nNow, let's list possible sequences.\n\nWe need S = Δy5 + Δy6 + Δy7 = -1 or -2.\n\nAnd Δy5 = 0 or 1.\n\nCase 1: S = -1\n\nThen y8 = 2 -1 =1\n\nSince y8=1, which is safe at T=8.\n\nThen y9 = y8 + Δy8 =1 + Δy8\n\ny9 must be 0 or 1.\n\nSo 1 + Δy8 <=1 => Δy8 <=0, and 1 + Δy8 >=0 => Δy8 >= -1.\n\nSo Δy8 = -1 or 0, so y9=0 or 1.\n\nIf y9=0, safe; y9=1, also safe since freeway 1 not occupied at T=9.\n\nThen we can go up later.\n\nCase 2: S = -2, y8=0\n\nThen y9 = 0 + Δy8\n\ny9 must be 0 or 1, so Δy8 =0 or 1, y9=0 or 1.\n\nAlso fine.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 faster, we should minimize the time to start going up.\n\nBut since we need to be low at T=8 and T=9, we might have to go down first.\n\nAfter T=9, we can go up directly to y=9.\n\nFrom y9, to y12=9, we need to increase by 8 or something.\n\ny9 <=1, y12=9, so need to increase by at least 8 in 3 actions? Actions at T=9,10,11 set y10,y11,y12.\n\ny10 = y9 + Δy9\n\ny11 = y10 + Δy10\n\ny12 = y11 + Δy11\n\nSo to have y12=9, y9 + Δy9 + Δy10 + Δy11 =9\n\ny9 <=1, so we need at least 8 increases, but only 3 actions, each can give +1, max increase 3, so y12 <= y9 +3 <=1+3=4 <9, impossible.\n\ny9 <=1, after 3 actions, y12 <=4, cannot reach 9.\n\nMistake.\n\ny12 is at T=12.\n\nTo reach y12=9 from y5=2 in 7 actions: a5 to a11.\n\nThe actions are at T=5 to T=11, 7 actions, setting y6 to y12.\n\ny6 = y5 + Δy5\n\n...\n\ny12 = y11 + Δy11\n\nSo y12 = y5 + sum_{i=5 to 11} Δy_i = 2 + sum_{t=5}^{11} Δy_t\n\nSet to 9, so sum_{t=5}^{11} Δy_t =7\n\nEach |Δy_t| <=1, so must have exactly 7 up moves, no down or stay, in the 7 actions.\n\nBut we have constraints at T=8 and T=9 that force us to have down moves or stays.\n\nSpecifically, for y8 and y9 to be low, we need some down moves in the first few actions.\n\nBut with only up moves, we cannot have y8 low.\n\nContradiction for minimal path with no delay.\n\nBut we must have down moves to satisfy y8=0 or 1.\n\nFor example, if we have down moves, then the sum may be less, so it takes more turns to reach y=9.\n\nSo minimal H will be larger than 8.\n\nLet's find the minimal possible T when we can reach y=9.\n\nWe need to be safe at T=8 and T=9, so we must spend those turns at y=0 or 1 or 9, but y=9 not reachable early.\n\nSo likely at T=8 and T=9, we are at y=0 or 1.\n\nThen from T=10 onwards, we go up.\n\nEach up move increases y by 1.\n\nFrom y9, which is 0 or 1, to y=9, we need at least 8 or 9 steps.\n\nFor example, if y9=1, then to reach y=9, we need 8 up moves, so at T=9+8=17, y17=9.\n\nSimilarly if y9=0, need 9 up moves, T=18.\n\nBut we can start going up earlier.\n\nAt T=10, we can be at y10, etc.\n\nBut from T=5 to T=9, we are constrained to be low at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFirst, from T=5 to T=9, we have 4 actions: a5 to a8, setting y6 to y9.\n\ny5=2.\n\ny9 must be 0 or 1 for safety at T=9.\n\nAlso, at T=8, y8 must be 0 or 1.\n\ny8 and y9 related.\n\ny9 = y8 + Δy8\n\nSince y8 <=1, and y9 <=1, Δy8 must be such that y9 <=1.\n\nIf y8=0, y9=0 or 1; if y8=1, y9=0 or 1.\n\nAlso, at T=6, y6 must not be 1.\n\ny6 = 2 + Δy5\n\nΔy5 in {-1,0,1}, but y6 !=1, so Δy5 != -1, so Δy5 =0 or 1, y6=2 or 3.\n\nNow, y9 = y5 + Δy5 + Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8 = 2 + sum_{t=5 to 8} Δy_t\n\nSet y9 <=1 and y9 >=0, so 2 + sum Δy_{5 to 8} <=1 => sum <= -1\n\nAnd 2 + sum >=0 => sum >= -2\n\nSo sum_{t=5 to 8} Δy_t = -1 or -2.\n\nSimilarly, for y8 = 2 + Δy5 + Δy6 + Δy7\n\ny8 must be 0 or 1, so 2 + S78 = 0 or 1, where S78 = Δy5 + Δy6 + Δy7\n\nSo S78 = -2 or -1.\n\nThen for y9 = y8 + Δy8, with y8=0 or 1, and y9=0 or 1.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 later, we need to have as many up moves as possible after T=9.\n\nBut first, let's find a sequence to satisfy the constraints with minimal delay.\n\nFor example, one way: at T=5, choose S or U.\n\nIf we choose U, y6=3 (since y6=2 or 3, not 1)\n\nThen at T=6, y=3, we can choose D, to y7=2\n\nThen at T=7, y=2, choose D, to y8=1\n\nThen at T=8, y=1, which is safe (freeway 1 not occupied at T=8)\n\nThen at T=8, we choose action, say S, to y9=1, or D to y9=0.\n\ny9 must be 0 or 1, both safe at T=9.\n\nSay we choose S at T=8, so y9=1.\n\nThen from T=9, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny9=1, so we need to increase by 8.\n\nActions at T=9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16: 8 actions of U, to reach y17=9.\n\nAt T=17, y=9.\n\nThen H such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1=5, y_{5 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt T=17, y=9, so 5 + H -1 =17, so H-1=12, H=13.\n\nSequence of 13 actions from t1 to t1+12.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nAt T=8, y8=1, we can choose U? But y9=2, but at T=9, y=2 is dangerous, since freeway 2 occupied.\n\nSo we cannot choose U at T=8 if y8=1, because y9=2, which is not safe at T=9.\n\nSimilarly, we must choose S or D at T=8 to keep y9=1 or 0.\n\nSo y9=1 or 0.\n\nThen from there, we go up.\n\nBut to reach faster, we should be as high as possible at T=9.\n\nSo at T=9, y9=1 is better than 0.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, y8=1.\n\nIn the above, we have y8=1, y9=1.\n\nCan we have y9=1 with fewer down moves?\n\nFor example, at T=5, choose S, y6=2\n\nThen at T=6, y=2, choose S, y7=2\n\nThen at T=7, y=2, choose D, y8=1\n\nThen at T=8, y=1, choose S, y9=1\n\nThen from T=9, go up.\n\nBut we have more stays, but y is higher at start.\n\nIn this case, from T=5 to T=7, we have two stays and one down, net change -1, y8=1.\n\nThen y9=1.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt T=5, choose U, y6=3\n\nT=6, y=3, choose S, y7=3\n\nT=7, y=3, choose D, y8=2, but y8=2 at T=8 is dangerous! y=2, freeway 2 occupied, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nT=7, y=3, choose D, y8=2, but y8=2 not safe.\n\nMust have y8=0 or 1.\n\nSo from y=3 at T=7, to have y8=1, need Δy7 = -2, impossible, so only y8=2 or 3 or 4, all in 2-4, dangerous at T=8.\n\nSo if at T=7, y7=3, we cannot reach safe y8 because with one action, y8=2,3,4, all dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, if y7=4, y8=3,4,5 dangerous.\n\nOnly if y7=0 or 1, then y8= -1,0,1,2 but y min 0, so y8=0,1,2.\n\nBut y8=2 dangerous, so y7 must be 0 or 1 to have y8=0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, y6 must be such that we can reach y7=0 or 1.\n\ny6=2 or 3 from earlier.\n\nIf y6=2, then at T=6, y=2, choose action.\n\nTo have y7=0 or 1, if choose D, y7=1; if S, y7=2; if U, y7=3.\n\nSo only if choose D, y7=1.\n\nThen from y7=1, we can have y8=0,1,2.\n\nTo have y8=0 or 1, choose D or S.\n\nIf choose U, y8=2 dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, if y6=3, at T=6, y=3, choose D, y7=2; then at T=7, y=2, choose D, y8=1; or choose S, y8=2 dangerous, U y8=3 dangerous, so must choose D to y8=1.\n\nBut at T=7, y=2, which is safe because at T=7, no freeway occupied except we said only T=6,8,9 dangerous, T=7 safe.\n\nT=7, τ=2, all freeways safe as earlier.\n\nSo y=2 at T=7 is ok.\n\nThen choose D to y8=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo possible sequences:\n\nOption 1:\n\nT=5: y=2, choose S, y6=2\n\nT=6: y=2, choose D, y7=1  (since if choose S, y7=2, then at T=7 safe, but then to y8, from y7=2, if choose D, y8=1; if S, y8=2 dangerous; U y8=3 dangerous, so must choose D to y8=1)\n\nT=7: y=2 (after action at T=6), choose D, y8=1\n\nT=8: y=1, choose S, y9=1\n\nThen T=9: y=1, choose U, y10=2\n\nBut at T=10, y=2, is it safe? T=10, τ=5, freeway 2: Span= [-29+30=1, -18+30=12], 1 to 12, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all freeways safe except T=8,9 past.\n\nT=10 and after, no cars at x=0, so all safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=11, etc.\n\nThen continue up.\n\nFrom T=9: y=1, a9=U, y10=2\n\nT=10: y=2, a10=U, y11=3\n\n...\n\nUp to T=15: y=7, a15=U, y16=8\n\nT=16: y=8, a16=U, y17=9\n\nThen at T=17, y=9.\n\nBut we need to be at y=9 at some turn, here at T=17.\n\nThen for the sequence, actions from T=5 to T=16, 12 actions, to set y17=9.\n\nThen y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{5 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt T=17, y=9, so 5 + H -1 =17, H-1=12, H=13.\n\nSequence: 13 actions from a5 to a17? a_t for t=5 to 16.\n\nt from 5 to 16 inclusive is 12 actions? T=5 to T=16, 12 turns, 12 actions.\n\nActions at times: a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, a11, a12, a13, a14, a15, a16\n\n12 actions.\n\nThen y17=9.\n\nNow, y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{5 + H -1} = y17 =9, so 5 + H -1 =17, thus H-1=12, H=13.\n\nYes, 13 actions.\n\nBut we can be at y=9 earlier by not going down so much.\n\nFor example, at T=5, choose U, y6=3\n\nT=6: y=3, choose D, y7=2  (safe at T=7)\n\nT=7: y=2, choose D, y8=1\n\nT=8: y=1, choose S, y9=1\n\nThen T=9: y=1, U, y10=2\n\n...\n\nSame as before, still y17=9.\n\nAfter T=9, y=1, we go up each turn to y17=9.\n\nBut at T=8, y8=1, we could choose U, but then y9=2, which is dangerous at T=9, so cannot.\n\nSo we must stay or down at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, to have y9 high, but y9 must be 0 or 1, so at most 1.\n\nThen from y=1, it takes 8 up moves to y=9.\n\nFirst up at T=9 to y10=2, then T=10 to y11=3, ..., T=16 to y17=9.\n\n8 actions from T=9 to T=16 to go from y9=1 to y17=9.\n\nActions a9 to a16, 8 actions, setting y10 to y17.\n\ny9=1, a9=U, y10=2; a10=U, y11=3; ... a16=U, y17=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, from T=5 to T=9, we have 4 actions: a5 to a8, setting y6 to y9.\n\nIn the sequence, with y9=1.\n\nNumber of actions from T=5 to T=8 is 4 actions for a5 to a8.\n\na5 to a8: 4 actions, setting y6,y7,y8,y9.\n\nIn the above, with a5=U or S, etc., but we have y9=1.\n\nThen actions a9 to a16: 8 actions.\n\nTotal actions: 4 + 8 =12 actions from a5 to a16.\n\nThen y17=9.\n\nH=13 as before.\n\nBut can we reach y=9 earlier?\n\nSuppose we can be at y=9 at T=12, but that requires no down moves, but at T=8 and T=9, we must be low, so impossible to be high at T=12 with only up moves from start.\n\nMinimal T to reach y=9 is 12 only if we can go directly, but we can't because of T=8,9.\n\nNext possible is after we go up from low point.\n\nSince at T=9, y=1, earliest to y=9 is T=17.\n\nIf we can be at y=0 at T=9, then from y=0, it takes 9 up moves to y=9, at T=18, worse.\n\nSo better to be at y=1 at T=9.\n\nBut is there a way to be higher at T=9? No, because y9 must be 0 or 1.\n\nUnless we can be at y=9 at T=9, but impossible from y=2.\n\nSo T=17 is the earliest possible.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can avoid the down moves.\n\nAnother idea: at T=5, we go up to y=6 or something, but at T=8, we need to be at y=0 or 1, so we have to come down, which wastes time.\n\nFor example, go up to y=5 at T=8, but y=5 dangerous, not possible.\n\nSo we must be low at T=8.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 at T=8, but impossible.\n\nSo I think T=17 is minimal.\n\nBut let's list the sequence with times.\n\nt1=5.\n\nActions:\n\nAt turn t1=5: choose action, say S or U.\n\nTo minimize time, better to go up if possible.\n\nBut at T=6, we need to avoid y=1, but we are not going down, so ok.\n\nIn the path to go down, we have to go down.\n\nSince we must be at y=1 or 0 at T=8 and T=9, and we start at y=2, we need to decrease at some point.\n\nThe sequence I had:\n\nT=5: y=2, action S, so y6=2\n\nT=6: y=2, action D, y7=1\n\nT=7: y=1, action? At T=7, y=1, which is safe, since only T=6 dangerous for y=1.\n\nThen to set y8, from y7=1, we can choose D to y8=0 or S to y8=1 or U to y8=2.\n\nBut y8 must be 0 or 1, so choose D or S.\n\nSay choose D to y8=0, or S to y8=1.\n\nThen at T=8, y=0 or 1, safe.\n\nThen choose action to set y9.\n\nIf y8=0, choose S to y9=0 or U to y9=1.\n\nIf y8=1, choose S to y9=1 or D to y9=0.\n\nThen y9=0 or 1.\n\nThen from T=9, start going up.\n\nTo be higher faster, set y9=1.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nT=5: action S, y6=2\n\nT=6: action D, y7=1\n\nT=7: action S, y8=1  (since y7=1, S, y8=1)\n\nT=8: action S, y9=1  (y8=1, S, y9=1)\n\nThen T=9: action U, y10=2\n\nT=10: U, y11=3\n\nT=11: U, y12=4\n\nT=12: U, y13=5\n\nT=13: U, y14=6\n\nT=14: U, y15=7\n\nT=15: U, y16=8\n\nT=16: U, y17=9\n\nNow, actions from T=5 to T=16: a5 to a16, 12 actions.\n\ny17=9.\n\nFor the goal, y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{5 + H -1} = y17 =9, so 5 + H -1 =17, H-1=12, H=13.\n\nThe sequence has actions from t=0 to H-1 for the offset, but in terms of turns, actions at t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nHere t1=5, actions at 5 to 16, which is t1 to t1+11, so H=12 actions? Let's index.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nFor t=0, a_{t1 +0} = a5\n\nt=1, a6\n\n...\n\nt=11, a_{5+11}=a16\n\nSo 12 actions, t from 0 to 11, H=12.\n\nThen y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{5+12-1} = y_{16}\n\ny16 is position at turn 16.\n\nIn the sequence, after a16, y17 is set, but y16 is before a16 or after?\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nAt turn 16, position y16.\n\nWe choose a16, which sets y17.\n\nIf y17=9, then at turn 17, position is 9.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith H=12, t1 + H -1 =5+12-1=16, y16=?\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 16, y16=8, not 9.\n\ny17=9.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nWith actions up to a16, we have y17=9, but y16=8.\n\nTo have y16=9, we need to reach earlier.\n\nBut in this case, with the constraints, we reach at T=17.\n\nIf we choose to go up faster after T=9.\n\nBut from y9=1, it takes 8 steps to y17=9.\n\nMinimal.\n\nPerhaps at T=8, we are at y=1, and at T=9, we are at y=1, but we can go up at T=9 to y10=2, etc.\n\nBut y at T=16 is 8, T=17 is 9.\n\nSo y16=8, not 9.\n\nTo have yK=9 for K=16, but from y9=1, with 7 actions: a9 to a15, setting y10 to y16.\n\ny10 = y9 + Δy9\n\n...\n\ny16 = y15 + Δy15\n\ny9=1, y16=9, so sum_{t=9 to 15} Δy_t =8\n\n7 actions, each Δy <=1, max sum 7, <8, impossible.\n\nCannot reach y16=9 from y9=1 in 7 actions.\n\nSimilarly, minimal at T=17.\n\nSo H=13 actions, with y17=9.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the above sequence, we have:\n\nTurn 5: S (or U, but let's use S for safety, but U is also possible)\n\nIn the sequence I had:\n\nT=5: S, y6=2\n\nT=6: D, y7=1\n\nT=7: S, y8=1\n\nT=8: S, y9=1\n\nT=9: U, y10=2\n\nT=10: U, y11=3\n\nT=11: U, y12=4\n\nT=12: U, y13=5\n\nT=13: U, y14=6\n\nT=14: U, y15=7\n\nT=15: U, y16=8\n\nT=16: U, y17=9\n\nActions from T=5 to T=16: a5 to a16.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list for each turn the action.\n\nAlso, for freeway, at T=7, y=1, freeway 1, but at T=7, not occupied, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nTo save one action? Not possible.\n\nAt T=5, if we choose U: a5=U, y6=3\n\nT=6: a6=D, y7=2\n\nT=7: a7=D, y8=1\n\nT=8: a8=S, y9=1\n\nThen same as above, from T=9 to T=16: U each, y17=9.\n\nSame number of actions.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo minimal H=13.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to output the actions from t1=5.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut the car state has freeway 7 and 8 with multiple cars, but we already considered, only the first one matters for occupation.\n\nIn freeway 7, at T=8, occupied, etc., but we avoid being there.\n\nNow, write the sequence.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn t1=5: action, let's choose S, for example.\n\nTo make y higher, but not necessary.\n\nIn the first choice, with S at T=5.\n\nThen:\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 7, action S, y8=1\n\nBut at turn 7, position y=1, which is freeway 1, and at T=7, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAt turn 8, y=1, action S, y9=1.\n\nThen from turn 9 to 16: U each.\n\nBut turn 16 action U sets y17=9.\n\nNow, the sequence has 12 actions? From turn 5 to turn 16, 12 turns.\n\nH=13? Let's count.\n\nActions at turns: 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 → 12 actions.\n\nThen y17=9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} = y_{5 + H -1} =9\n\nSet 5 + H -1 =17, so H-1=12, H=13.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, from t=0 to H-1, so for H=13, actions at t1 to t1+12, which is turn 5 to 17.\n\nt1 to t1+12: 5 to 17, 13 turns.\n\nBut we need actions only until we reach, but in this case, at turn 17, we choose action to set y18, but we are already at y17=9.\n\nI think I have confusion with the indexing.\n\nIn the sequence above, with actions up to turn 16, we have y17=9.\n\nSo at turn 17, position is 9, so we don't need to choose an action for turn 17.\n\nIn the sequence, we should include actions until the turn when we reach.\n\nBut in the problem, the sequence is to have y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIf y_{t1 + H -1} =9, then for the action at that turn, we can choose S to stay.\n\nFor example, to have y16=9, but we cannot with constraints.\n\nIn this case, with actions, we reach at turn 17.\n\nSo for turn 17, we don't choose action, but the sequence includes up to the action that sets the position to 9.\n\nPerhaps in the sequence, for turn t1 + H -1, we choose an action that makes us at 9 at that turn or something.\n\nAssume that at turn t1 + H -1, position is 9, and we choose an action, which could be S.\n\nIn the path, at turn 16, y16=8, we choose U, so at turn 17, y17=9.\n\nSo at turn 17, position is 9.\n\nFor the sequence, we need to include action for turn 16.\n\nThen turn 17, we are at 9, so we can choose S, but it is not necessary for reaching, but to have the position at turn t1+H-1=9.\n\nSet T_reach = t1 + H -1 =17.\n\nThen actions from t1 to t1+H-2? Messy.\n\nWith H=13, t1+H-1=5+13-1=17, y17=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to 12 for the sequence: a_{t1} to a_{t1+12}, i.e., a5 to a17.\n\nBut at turn 17, we need to choose an action, but since y17=9, we can choose S to stay.\n\nIn the sequence above, we don't have action at turn 17 yet.\n\nIn the path, after a16 at turn 16, y17=9.\n\nThen at turn 17, we can choose a17=S, so y18=9, but we are already at 9.\n\nFor the sequence to have 13 actions, we can include a17=S.\n\nThen y18=9, but we reach at turn 17.\n\nBut the goal is to have position at turn t1+H-1=17 to be 9, which it is.\n\nThen action at turn 17 is S.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence, we have actions from turn 5 to 17.\n\nBut at turn 5 to 16, we have 12 actions, plus turn 17, 13 actions.\n\nFor turn 17, action S.\n\nNow, for the car, at turn 17, y=9, no issue.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U  (y17=9)\n\nThen at turn 17, y=9, action S, y18=9.\n\nBut we don't care beyond.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 17, we choose S.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to list from turn t1=5.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 7 action S, but at turn 7, y=1, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all turns are safe.\n\nTo make it shorter, but not possible.\n\nAnother sequence: at T=5, U, y6=3\n\nT=6, D, y7=2\n\nT=7, D, y8=1\n\nT=8, S, y9=1\n\nT=9, U, y10=2\n\n...\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nH=13.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nThe car state has freeway 7 and 8 with multiple cars, but we handled.\n\nIn freeway 7, at T=8, the first car has span including 0, but we avoid being on freeway at that time.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1} = S (for example)\n\nBut in the answer, we need to specify.\n\nPerhaps we can choose U at T=5 to be higher, but not necessary.\n\nLet's write the actions.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 13. This means the sequence of actions starts at turn 5 and ends at turn 17, with the player reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17 (i.e., \\(y_{17} = 9\\)).\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed to:\n- Avoid being on freeway \\(y = 1\\) at turn 6 (when it is occupied).\n- Avoid being on freeways \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at turns 8 and 9 (when they are occupied).\n- Reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible after the dangerous turns.\n\nThe actions are as follows:\n- At turn 5, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 2\\), which is safe.\n- At turn 6, move down (D) to \\(y = 1\\). Although freeway 1 is occupied at turn 6, the player moves to \\(y = 1\\) at the end of turn 6 (i.e., position at turn 7 is \\(y = 1\\)), so no collision occurs at turn 6.\n- At turn 7, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 1\\), which is safe at turn 7.\n- At turn 8, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 1\\), avoiding freeways 2-8 which are occupied.\n- At turn 9, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 1\\), avoiding freeways 2-8 which are occupied.\n- From turns 10 to 16, move up (U) repeatedly to increase \\(y\\) from 2 to 9.\n- At turn 17, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 9\\), as the goal is reached.\n\nThe sequence ensures that at every turn, the player is not on a freeway where a car occupies \\(x = 0\\) at that specific turn. The positions and safety are verified as follows:\n- Turn 5: \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2, safe as no car at \\(x=0\\)).\n- Turn 6: Action D sets \\(y_7 = 1\\); at turn 6, \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2, safe).\n- Turn 7: \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1, safe as no car at \\(x=0\\) at turn 7).\n- Turn 8: \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1, safe as no car at \\(x=0\\) at turn 8).\n- Turn 9: \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1, safe as no car at \\(x=0\\) at turn 9).\n- Turns 10-16: Moving up through freeways, all safe as no cars occupy \\(x=0\\) after turn 9.\n- Turn 17: \\(y = 9\\) (safe, no freeway).\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns 5 to 17 (13 actions) is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: S \\\\\nTurn 6: D \\\\\nTurn 7: S \\\\\nTurn 8: S \\\\\nTurn 9: S \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 7, and the player is at (0,2). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe grid has freeways at y=1 to 8. The player moves vertically (y-direction) with actions U (+1), D (-1), S (0). The player cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn, the x=0 is within the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nImportant note: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on y_T during turn T. So when you move, you leave the current freeway and are on the next one only at the next turn.\n\nCar update:\nFor each car, at turn t1 (current turn) we are given (head, tail, direction, speed). Note that for left-moving cars, the head is at the left (so the car extends from head to tail with head < tail? Actually, the representation is:\n- Left-moving: the car moves left, so at time t1, the span is [h, τ] and then at time T, it becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n- Right-moving: the car moves right, so at time t1, the span is [τ, h] (note: tail to head? but then the update is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. Actually, the representation in the table is (head, tail, ...). Let me clarify:\n\nIn the table for freeway 1: (12, 1, right, 12)\nFor a right-moving car, the head is the front (which is the rightmost point) and the tail is the leftmost? But note the update: \n  Right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\nSo at t1, the span is [τ, h]? But the table says (head, tail) = (12, 1). Then at t1, the car is from 1 to 12? So the head is 12 and tail is 1? That would be a right-moving car: as time increases, the car moves right so the span becomes [1 + s*dt, 12 + s*dt].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car, the head is the front (leftmost) and tail the rightmost? Then the update: [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt]. So at t1, the car is from h to τ (with h < τ) and then moves left.\n\nBut in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Actually, the table only shows right-moving cars. The direction is \"right\".\n\nSo for a car (h, τ, right, s) at t1, the car's span at time T (>= t1) is:\n  [τ + s*(T - t1), h + s*(T - t1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: [h - s*(T - t1), τ - s*(T - t1)]\n\nBut in our case, all are right-moving.\n\nWe are at turn t1=7, and we need to simulate the car positions for future turns.\n\nThe player starts at y=2 at turn 7.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate) is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nNote: the player is at (0, y) at turn T. So for each turn T, we check the freeway y_T (if y_T is between 1 and 8) and see if any car on that freeway at turn T has 0 in its span.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=7.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal number of turns is at least 7 because we start at y=2 and we need to go up 7 steps (if we only move up). But we might have to wait because of cars.\n\nLet me list the cars per freeway at t1=7:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=12, τ=1, right, s=12) -> at time t1=7: span [1, 12]? \nBut note: the update formula for right-moving: \n  At T, span = [τ + s*(T-7), h + s*(T-7)] = [1 + 12*(T-7), 12 + 12*(T-7)]\n\nFreeway 2: (-6, -17, right, 6) -> span at T: [-17+6*(T-7), -6+6*(T-7)]\n\nSimilarly, freeways 3,4,5,6: same as freeway 2? Each has the same car? Or are they separate? The table says:\n  Freeway 2: (-6, -17, right, 6)\n  Freeway 3: same\n  ... up to freeway 6: same.\n\nThen freeway 7: three cars: \n  (-6, -17, right, 6), (30, 19, right, 6), (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7.\n\nWe need to simulate the player's movement and check for collisions.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn t1=7 (t=0 in our sequence index) to turn t1+H-1, and H is the minimal turns.\n\nWe'll try to find the minimal H by simulating the future car positions and the player's possible moves.\n\nWe note that the player can move up, down, or stay. But the goal is to get to y=9 as quickly as possible, so we prefer moving up. However, we might have to wait (stay) or even move down to avoid a collision.\n\nWe start at y=2 at turn 7.\n\nWe need to reach y=9. The minimal moves without any cars would be 7 moves: U repeated 7 times. But we have to avoid collisions on freeways 2,3,...,8.\n\nBut note: at the turn when we are at y=9, we are not on any freeway (because freeways are y=1..8). So we only worry during the journey.\n\nWe will simulate turn by turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn relative to t1: turn 0 is t1=7, turn 1 is t=8, etc.\n\nPlayer state: at turn i (relative to t1, so absolute turn = t1+i), the player is at y_i.\n\nWe start: i=0, y0=2.\n\nWe need to choose actions a_0 (at turn t1=7), a_1 (at turn 8), ... until we get to y=9.\n\nWe must not be on a freeway (y from 1 to 8) at any turn i (absolute turn = 7+i) when there is a car on that freeway that has 0 in its span at that absolute turn.\n\nLet's precompute the car spans for each freeway for future turns.\n\nFirst, note that the cars are moving continuously. We are only concerned with when they cover x=0.\n\nFor each freeway, we have a set of cars. For each car, we can compute the times (turns) when it covers x=0.\n\nBut note: the car spans are intervals. For a car on freeway k, it is dangerous at turn T if 0 is in [τ + s*(T-7), h + s*(T-7)] for a right-moving car.\n\nSo we can compute the time interval during which the car covers x=0.\n\nFor a right-moving car (h, τ, right, s) at t1=7:\n  The car covers x=0 when:\n      τ + s*(T-7) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-7)\n\nBut note: in the representation, for right-moving, the head h is the right end and τ is the left end? Actually, from the update, the span at T is [τ + s*(T-7), h + s*(T-7)]. And since the car is moving right, and we assume τ < h? \n\nLooking at the data:\n\nFreeway1: (12,1,...) -> at T=7: [1,12] -> so τ=1, h=12 -> so τ < h.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2: (-6,-17,...) -> at T=7: [-17,-6] -> so τ=-17, h=-6 -> τ < h.\n\nFreeway7: first car (-6,-17) -> same as above; second car (30,19) -> wait, 30 and 19: then at T=7: [19,30]? But wait, the representation is (head, tail) and for right-moving, we use [τ + s*(T-7), h + s*(T-7)]. But note: the table says (head, tail) = (30,19). So if head=30 and tail=19, then the car is from 19 to 30? So τ=19, h=30? Then the update is [19+6*(T-7), 30+6*(T-7)]. \n\nBut wait, the third car on freeway7: (-48,-59) -> then at T=7: [-59+6*(0), -48+6*(0)] = [-59, -48].\n\nSo for each car, we can compute the time interval [T_start, T_end] (in real numbers) during which 0 is in the car's span. Then we can check at integer turns T (>=7) if T is in that interval.\n\nHowever, note that T is an integer (turn count). So we can compute for each car the set of integer T when 0 is covered.\n\nBut note: the problem says collision occurs at turn T if 0 is in the span at that exact turn T.\n\nSo for a car, the condition is:\n\n  τ + s*(T-7) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-7)\n\nSolve for T:\n\n  τ + s*(T-7) <= 0  => T-7 >= (0 - τ) / s   => T >= 7 + ceil((0 - τ)/s) ? But we are dealing with real numbers and then we check integer T.\n\nActually, we can write:\n\n  Lower bound: T >= 7 + (0 - τ) / s\n  Upper bound: T <= 7 + (0 - h) / s   ??? Wait, let me rearrange:\n\nFrom:\n  τ + s*(T-7) <= 0   => s*(T-7) <= -τ   => T-7 <= -τ/s   => T <= 7 - τ/s   ??? \n\nWait, no:\n\nτ + s*(T-7) <= 0 \n  => s*(T-7) <= -τ \n  => T-7 <= -τ/s \n  => T <= 7 - τ/s\n\nBut note: τ is negative in some cases? Let's take freeway2: τ=-17, s=6.\n\nThen: T-7 <= -(-17)/6 = 17/6 ≈ 2.833 -> T <= 7+2.833 = 9.833? That doesn't match.\n\nActually, let me do:\n\n  τ + s*(T-7) <= 0 \n  => s*(T-7) <= -τ \n  => T-7 <= (-τ) / s \n\nBut if τ is negative, then -τ is positive. \n\nSimilarly, the other inequality:\n\n  0 <= h + s*(T-7) \n  => s*(T-7) >= -h \n  => T-7 >= (-h) / s \n\nSo for freeway2 car: τ=-17, h=-6, s=6.\n\nThen:\n  T-7 >= (-h)/s = 6/6 = 1 -> T>=8\n  T-7 <= (-τ)/s = 17/6 ≈ 2.833 -> T<= 7+2.833 = 9.833\n\nSo T must be in [8, 9.833]. Since T is integer, T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway1: τ=1, h=12, s=12.\n\nThen:\n  T-7 >= (-h)/s = -12/12 = -1 -> always true for T>=7? But we are only concerned T>=7.\n  T-7 <= (-τ)/s = -1/12 -> which is negative -> so no T>=7 satisfies? \n\nWait, let me check the condition:\n\nWe require: τ + s*(T-7) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-7)\n\nAt T=7: τ=1, h=12 -> 1<=0<=12? -> 0 is not between 1 and 12.\n\nSo for freeway1, the car never covers 0? Because the car is from 1 to 12 at T=7 and moves right, so it only moves to the right and never covers 0 (which is to the left of 1).\n\nSimilarly, let's do freeway7 cars:\n\nFirst car: (h=-6, τ=-17, right, s=6) -> same as freeway2: so dangerous at T=8,9.\n\nSecond car: (h=30, τ=19, right, s=6) -> at T=7: [19,30]. Then:\n  Condition: 19 + 6*(T-7) <= 0 <= 30 + 6*(T-7)\n\n  First inequality: 19 + 6*(T-7) <= 0 -> 6*(T-7) <= -19 -> T-7 <= -19/6 ≈ -3.166 -> T <= 3.833 -> but T>=7, so no solution.\n\nThird car: (h=-48, τ=-59, right, s=6) -> at T=7: [-59,-48]. Then:\n  Condition: -59 + 6*(T-7) <= 0 <= -48 + 6*(T-7)\n\n  Left: -59 + 6*(T-7) <= 0 -> 6*(T-7) <= 59 -> T-7 <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833 -> T<=16.833\n  Right: 0 <= -48 + 6*(T-7) -> 48 <= 6*(T-7) -> T-7 >= 8 -> T>=15\n\nSo T in [15, 16.833] -> T=15,16.\n\nNow, let's compile for each freeway the dangerous turns:\n\nFreeway 1: no dangerous turn.\n\nFreeway 2: dangerous at T=8,9.\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2 -> T=8,9.\n\nFreeway 4: same -> T=8,9.\n\nFreeway 5: same -> T=8,9.\n\nFreeway 6: same -> T=8,9.\n\nFreeway 7: \n  car1: T=8,9\n  car2: none\n  car3: T=15,16\n\nSo dangerous at T=8,9 (from car1) and T=15,16 (from car3).\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway7 -> dangerous at T=8,9 and T=15,16.\n\nNow, note that the player is at:\n\nAt turn 7 (absolute) = relative turn 0: y=2.\n\nWe want to plan a sequence of actions.\n\nWe note that we must avoid being on freeways 2 to 8 at the dangerous times for that freeway.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Freeway 1: safe at all times (since no car covers 0).\n- Freeway 2: avoid at T=8,9 -> so if we are on freeway2 at absolute turn 8 or 9, we crash.\n- Similarly, freeways 3,4,5,6: same as freeway2: avoid at T=8,9.\n- Freeway7: avoid at T=8,9,15,16.\n- Freeway8: avoid at T=8,9,15,16.\n\nOur journey: we start at y=2 (freeway2? Actually, the player is at (0,2) at turn7. But note: freeways are y=1..8. So y=2 is freeway2.\n\nAt turn7, we are on freeway2. But is freeway2 dangerous at turn7? From above, freeway2 is dangerous at T=8 and 9, not at 7. So at turn7, we are safe.\n\nNow, we have to choose an action at turn7 (a0): U, D, or S.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nIf we go up at turn7: then at turn8 (absolute), we will be at y=3.\n\nBut at turn8, freeway3 (y=3) is dangerous? Yes, because freeway3 is dangerous at T=8. So if we are on y=3 at turn8, we crash.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay at turn7: then at turn8 we are still at y=2 (freeway2) -> which is dangerous at turn8 -> crash.\n\nIf we go down: to y=1 at turn8 -> freeway1 is safe at turn8? Yes, because freeway1 has no dangerous turns. So that is safe.\n\nSo at turn7, if we go down (D) then at turn8 we are at y=1, which is safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=1 and we need to go up to 9. That might take longer.\n\nAlternatively, we could wait until the dangerous period is over. The dangerous period for freeways 2-6 and also 7,8 at T=8,9 ends after T=9. So at T=10, these freeways are safe? \n\nBut note: freeways 7 and 8 are also dangerous at T=15,16. But we hope to be done by then? The minimal steps without waiting is 7 steps, so we would be at y=9 by turn7+7=14, which is before 15. So if we can avoid the initial danger, we might not meet the later danger.\n\nBut if we get stuck, we might.\n\nSo let's try to plan:\n\nOption 1: Go down to y=1 at turn8 (by doing D at turn7). Then we are at y=1 at turn8.\n\nAt turn8, we are at y=1 (freeway1) and it is safe.\n\nThen we can start going up. But we need to avoid being on freeways 2-8 during their dangerous times? Specifically, freeways 2-6 and 7,8 are dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\nAt turn8, we are at y=1 -> safe.\n\nAt turn9, we can do U: then we go to y=2 at turn9.\n\nBut at turn9, freeway2 is dangerous -> crash.\n\nSo we cannot go up at turn9 to y=2.\n\nAlternatively, at turn8 (after being at y=1) we can stay: then at turn9 we are at y=1 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn10, we can go up: to y=2 at turn10.\n\nNow, at turn10: freeway2 is safe? Because freeway2 is only dangerous at T=8,9 -> so at T=10, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can then go up: from y=2 to y=3 at turn11, etc.\n\nSo the plan:\n\nTurn7 (relative0): D -> to y=1 at turn8 (absolute8)\nTurn8 (relative1): S -> stay at y=1 at turn9\nTurn9 (relative2): U -> to y=2 at turn10\nThen we can do U every turn until we get to y=9.\n\nFrom y=2 at turn10, we need 7 moves to get to y=9: \n  turn10: y=2 -> U: turn11: y=3\n  turn11: y=3 -> U: turn12: y=4\n  turn12: y=4 -> U: turn13: y=5\n  turn13: y=5 -> U: turn14: y=6\n  turn14: y=6 -> U: turn15: y=7\n  turn15: y=7 -> U: turn16: y=8\n  turn16: y=8 -> U: turn17: y=9\n\nBut wait: at turn15, we are at y=7. And freeway7 is dangerous at T=15? Yes! So at turn15, we are on freeway7 and T=15 is dangerous -> crash.\n\nSimilarly, at turn16: we are at y=8 (freeway8) and T=16 is dangerous -> crash.\n\nSo we crash at turn15 and 16.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway7 at T=15 and freeway8 at T=16.\n\nWe are at y=7 at turn15 -> crash.\n\nWe need to adjust.\n\nWe can delay our movement so that we are not on freeway7 at T=15 or freeway8 at T=16.\n\nWe have two options:\n\nOption A: Wait at a safe freeway until after T=16? But that would be too slow.\n\nOption B: Arrange to skip freeway7 and freeway8 during T=15,16.\n\nWe note that we can only move one step per turn. So we cannot jump over freeways.\n\nWe can try to be at freeway7 after T=16? But we are at y=6 at turn14, then we have to go to y=7 at some turn. The next turn after T=16 is T=17.\n\nSo we can do:\n\nAt turn14: we are at y=6. Instead of going up at turn14, we can wait at y=6.\n\nFreeway6: is it safe at T=14? Freeway6 was dangerous only at T=8,9 -> so safe at T=14.\n\nSo at turn14: S -> stay at y=6.\n\nThen at turn15: still at y=6 -> safe (freeway6 safe at T=15).\n\nAt turn16: we can go up to y=7? But freeway7 is dangerous at T=16? Yes, so we crash at freeway7 at T=16.\n\nAlternatively, at turn15: we can go up to y=7? Then at turn15 we are at y=7 -> freeway7 at T=15: dangerous -> crash.\n\nSo we must avoid freeway7 at T=15 and T=16.\n\nWe can only be at freeway7 at a turn T not in {15,16}. Similarly for freeway8.\n\nSo we can be at freeway7 at T=17 or later? But we want to minimize time.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to be at freeway7 at a safe time and then quickly move through freeway7 and freeway8.\n\nBut the dangerous times for freeway7 and freeway8 are T=15,16. So if we are at freeway7 at T=17, then freeway7 is safe at T=17? Yes, because the dangerous times are only 15,16.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8 at T=17 is safe? Yes.\n\nSo if we can be at y=7 at T=17 and then y=8 at T=18, and then y=9 at T=19, that would be safe.\n\nHow?\n\nWe need to adjust our timing.\n\nWe are at turn10: y=2.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. We have 7 steps to go. But we have to avoid freeway7 and freeway8 at T=15,16.\n\nWe want to be at freeway7 at T=17, freeway8 at T=18, and then freeway9 (which is not a freeway) at T=19.\n\nSo we need to delay by 2 turns.\n\nWe can wait at some safe freeway for 2 turns.\n\nFor example, we can wait at y=6 for two turns: at turn14 and turn15? \n\nBut we need to see the whole path.\n\nLet me plan from turn10:\n\nTurn10 (relative3): we are at y=2 -> we do U: turn11: y=3\nTurn11: U -> turn12: y=4\nTurn12: U -> turn13: y=5\nTurn13: U -> turn14: y=6\n\nNow at turn14: y=6. We want to wait 2 turns? \n\nThen:\nTurn14: S -> y=6 at turn15\nTurn15: S -> y=6 at turn16\n\nThen turn16: U -> y=7 at turn17 -> safe (freeway7 at T=17: safe)\nTurn17: U -> y=8 at turn18 -> safe (freeway8 at T=18: safe)\nTurn18: U -> y=9 at turn19\n\nSo total turns: from turn7 to turn19: 12 turns? But we started at turn7 (relative0) and the last action is at turn18 (relative11) to get to y=9 at turn19.\n\nBut we can also try to wait less? \n\nNote: we can also wait at a lower freeway. But we are at y=6 at turn14. Alternatively, we could have waited earlier.\n\nBut let's count the turns:\n\nAt turn7: we are at y=2.\n\nWe did:\n  turn7 (0): D -> y=1 at turn8\n  turn8 (1): S -> y=1 at turn9\n  turn9 (2): U -> y=2 at turn10\n  turn10 (3): U -> y=3 at turn11\n  turn11 (4): U -> y=4 at turn12\n  turn12 (5): U -> y=5 at turn13\n  turn13 (6): U -> y=6 at turn14\n  turn14 (7): S -> y=6 at turn15\n  turn15 (8): S -> y=6 at turn16\n  turn16 (9): U -> y=7 at turn17\n  turn17 (10): U -> y=8 at turn18\n  turn18 (11): U -> y=9 at turn19\n\nSo H = 12? But we started at turn7 and the last action is at turn18, so the sequence has 12 actions? Actually, from t=0 to t=11 relative, that's 12 actions? \n\nBut note: we are to output actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1. And H is the number of turns. At the end, we are at turn t1+H-1 and we have y=9.\n\nIn the example above: \n  We start at turn7 (t1=7). \n  After 12 actions (from turn7 to turn18), at turn18 we do the last action (U) and then at turn19 we are at y=9. But the problem says: we want to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me check the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then at the end of the sequence, after H actions, we are at turn t1+H-1? \n\nActually, the action a_t is taken at turn t. So:\n\nAt turn t1 (7): a_7\nThen at turn t1+1 (8): a_8\n...\nAt turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd after the last action, we are at the position at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nWait, no: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\" -> but note the action sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, and after the last action (at t1+H-1) we are at y_{t1+H-1}? \n\nBut the update: after action at t, we get y_{t+1}. \n\nSo:\n\nAt turn t1: we are at y_{t1} = 2.\nThen we apply action a_{t1} -> at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}.\n\nWe want at some turn T = t1+H-1, we are at y_T = 9? \n\nBut note: the last action is at turn T = t1+H-1, and then the state at turn T is after that action? \n\nActually, the state at turn t is the state at the beginning of the turn? \n\nBut the problem says: \n  \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nSo the action at turn t determines the next state at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, the player is at y_{t} at the beginning of turn t.\n\nAfter action at turn t, we get y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at turn t1: y_{t1}=2.\n\nWe want to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\nBut if we take H-1 actions, then:\n\nAfter action at turn t1: we are at y_{t1+1}\n...\nAfter action at turn t1+H-2: we are at y_{t1+H-1}\nAfter action at turn t1+H-1: we are at y_{t1+H}\n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nSo we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? But we are at the beginning of the turn, and then we take an action? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nSo we are to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Then we don't take an action at that turn? \n\nBut the sequence of actions is from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1? That would be H actions.\n\nBut if we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to take an action at that turn? But the sequence includes an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me reread the problem:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd then \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut note: the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1, which is H actions.\n\nAnd after these actions, we are at y_{t1+H}? But the problem says we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1 and then the state at the end of that turn (which is the beginning of the next turn) is y_{t1+H}? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nI think there is a confusion.\n\nLooking at the update: the player position is updated at the next turn. So:\n\nAt turn t, the player is at y_t.\nThen we apply action a_t -> we get y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, to be at (0,9) at a specific turn T, we must have y_T = 9.\n\nWe start at turn t1: y_{t1}=2.\n\nWe want to be at y_T = 9 for some T = t1+H-1? \n\nBut then the actions we take are from turn t1 to turn T-1 = t1+H-2? So the sequence would be of length H-1.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning H actions, from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThen after these actions, we are at turn t1+H, and we have y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nAnother possibility: the \"turns\" in H include the starting turn? But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence of actions for H turns.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the answer format: it says \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\", then \"Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\", ... until \"Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\".\n\nAnd we are to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\nBut by the update:\n\nAfter a_{t1}: we get y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n...\nAfter a_{t1+H-2}: we get y_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1.\nThen after a_{t1+H-1}: we get y_{t1+H} at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says we want y_{t1+H-1}=9? That would be the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, before we take an action.\n\nSo to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we don't take an action at turn t1+H-1? But the sequence includes an action at that turn.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last action is taken at turn t1+H-2, and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9. But then the sequence would be of length H-1, not H.\n\nI think the intended meaning is:\n\nWe take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1 (total H actions), and then at the next turn (turn t1+H) we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAnother interpretation: \"turns\" in H might be the number of moves. And the turn at which we arrive at 9 is t1+H-1.\n\nBut then we take H actions: at t1, t1+1, ... , t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H-1 we have the state after the last action? \n\nBut the update rule: after action at t, we get the state at t+1.\n\nSo after action at t1+H-1, we are at state at turn t1+H.\n\nTherefore, to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, we must have already arrived at an earlier action.\n\nI think there is a discrepancy.\n\nLooking at the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and then in the answer format, the last action is at turn t1+H-1.\n\nAnd then it says \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nThis suggests that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9, and then we take an action at that turn? But that action would then move us away.\n\nAlternatively, the action at turn t1+H-1 is the last action, and then the state at the end of that turn (which is the beginning of the next turn) is not considered for the goal? \n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nI think the intended meaning is that after the action at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? But that contradicts the update rule.\n\nPerhaps the turn index is the state after the action of that turn? \n\nTo resolve, let me assume that the problem means:\n\n- At turn t1, we start at (0,2) and take an action a_{t1} -> then we are at a new state at the same turn? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother common way: the turn is the time step at which we apply the action and then the state is updated for the next turn.\n\nGiven the update rule, I believe the standard is:\n\n- At turn t, we are in state s_t.\n- We apply action a_t.\n- Then we transition to s_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, to be at (0,9) at turn T, we must have s_T = (0,9).\n\nWe start at turn t1: s_{t1} = (0,2).\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at turn T = t1 + H - 1.\n\nThen the actions we take are from turn t1 to turn T-1 = t1+H-2.\n\nSo the sequence of actions would be for turns t1 to t1+H-2, which is H-1 actions.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence is for t=t1 to t1+H-1, which is H actions.\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nPerhaps H is the number of turns from the start until the arrival, including the start? But then at turn t1 (the start) we are at 2, not 9.\n\nI think the only logical interpretation is that we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H, and we take H actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1.\n\nThen the problem should say: \"such that y_{t1+H} = 9\".\n\nBut it says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nPerhaps it's a off-by-one.\n\nGiven the answer format, and to avoid confusion, let us assume that the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nThen the goal is y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nAnd the minimal H such that there exists a sequence of H actions leading to that state.\n\nThen in our plan above, we want to be at y=9 at turn19 (absolute) = t1+H = 7+H.\n\nSo 7+H = 19 -> H=12.\n\nThen the actions are from turn7 to turn18 (12 actions).\n\nBut the problem says in the answer format: the last turn is t1+H-1, which is 7+12-1=18, and we output a_{18}.\n\nThen at turn19 we are at y=9.\n\nAnd the problem says \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\" would be y_{18}=9? But in our plan, at turn18 we are at y=8, and then after action U at turn18, we go to y=9 at turn19.\n\nSo y_{18} is 8, not 9.\n\nThis does not match.\n\nAlternatively, if we require y_{t1+H-1}=9, then we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nThen we don't take an action at turn t1+H-1? But the sequence includes it.\n\nUnless the action at turn t1+H-1 is not taken, but the sequence goes up to turn t1+H-2.\n\nThen the sequence has H-1 actions.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that we take actions for H turns, and at the turn after the last action, we are at 9, but that turn is not part of the action turns.\n\nBut the answer format includes actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nGiven the confusion, let me assume that the standard in such problems is that we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1 (H actions), and then the state at turn t1+H is the result.\n\nAnd the goal is to have y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nThen in the problem, \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\" might be a typo, and it should be turn t1+H.\n\nOr perhaps \"turn\" in the reaching includes the action turn.\n\nTo resolve, let us look at the collision rule: it says \"collision occurs at turn T only if ... when the player is on freeway y_T\". This suggests that at turn T, the player is at y_T.\n\nSo the state at turn T is (0, y_T).\n\nWe start at turn t1: y_{t1}=2.\n\nWe want to be at turn T with y_T=9.\n\nThe actions are taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., T-1, to reach state at turn T.\n\nSo the number of actions is T - t1.\n\nThen H, the number of turns in the sequence, is T - t1.\n\nAnd T = t1+H.\n\nThen the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1 (H actions), and then at turn t1+H, we are at the desired state.\n\nAnd the problem should say: \"such that y_{t1+H} = 9\".\n\nGiven that, we'll assume that.\n\nSo in our earlier plan, we want to be at y=9 at turn19 = t1+H = 7+H -> H=12.\n\nActions from turn7 to turn18 (12 actions).\n\nBut in the problem's answer format, it says \"Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\" which is turn18.\n\nAnd we are at y=9 at turn19.\n\nNow, is there a faster way? With H=12, but we might do better.\n\nWe had to wait at y=6 for two turns to avoid freeway7 and freeway8 at turns15,16.\n\nCan we avoid that by taking a different route?\n\nFor example, after the initial down and wait, we could move up faster and then wait at a higher floor? But we can't skip freeways.\n\nOr we could move up immediately at turn7 and avoid the initial danger by moving to a safe freeway.\n\nAt turn7: we are at y=2 (freeway2). If we go up, at turn8 we are at y=3 (freeway3) -> dangerous at turn8 -> crash.\n\nIf we go down, we avoid.\n\nBut is there another safe action at turn7? We could stay: then at turn8 we are at y=2 -> dangerous at turn8 -> crash.\n\nSo only down is safe initially.\n\nThen we are at y=1 at turn8.\n\nAt turn8: we are at y=1 (safe). We could go up to y=2 at turn9 -> dangerous (freeway2 at turn9) -> crash.\n\nOr stay at y=1 at turn9 -> safe.\n\nOr down: to y=0 at turn9 -> but y=0 is not a freeway, so no collision. But then we are at y=0, and we need to go up to 9, which is farther.\n\nSo that would take even more turns.\n\nSo our only option at turn8 is to stay.\n\nThen at turn9: we are at y=1. Then we can go up to y=2 at turn10 -> safe.\n\nThen we are at y=2 at turn10.\n\nNow, can we avoid the later wait at y=6?\n\nWe are at turn10: y=2.\n\nWe need to get to y=9, but avoid freeway7 and freeway8 at turns15,16.\n\nThe soonest we can be at y=9 is if we move up continuously.\n\nIf we move up from turn10 to turn16: 7 moves, so at turn17 we would be at y=9.\n\nBut let's see the turns:\n\n turn10: y=2\n turn11: U -> y=3\n turn12: U -> y=4\n turn13: U -> y=5\n turn14: U -> y=6\n turn15: U -> y=7 -> but at turn15, freeway7 is dangerous -> crash.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nWe have to delay.\n\nWe can delay by 2 turns somewhere between y=2 and y=6.\n\nFor example, wait at y=2 for two turns? But then we are at y=2 at turn11 and turn12.\n\nFreeway2 is safe after turn9, so safe at turn10,11,12,... .\n\nThen:\n turn10: S -> y=2\n turn11: S -> y=2\n turn12: U -> y=3\n turn13: U -> y=4\n turn14: U -> y=5\n turn15: U -> y=6 -> but we need to avoid freeway7 at turn15? We are at freeway6 at turn15, which is safe.\n turn16: U -> y=7 -> freeway7 at turn16: dangerous -> crash.\n\nSo still crash at turn16.\n\nIf we wait at y=2 for one turn and then continue, we would be at y=6 at turn15 -> safe, then at turn16: U to y=7 -> crash.\n\nWe need to be at freeway7 no earlier than turn17.\n\nSo we must be at y=6 at least until turn16.\n\nAt turn14: if we are at y=6, then we can wait at y=6 for two turns (turn14 and turn15) -> as in our first plan.\n\nAlternatively, wait at y=5 for two turns? Let's try:\n\nAt turn10: y=2\n turn10: U -> y=3\n turn11: U -> y=4\n turn12: U -> y=5\n turn13: S -> y=5\n turn14: S -> y=5\n turn15: U -> y=6 -> safe (freeway6 at turn15: safe)\n turn16: U -> y=7 -> dangerous at turn16 (freeway7) -> crash.\n\nSame issue.\n\nWe must not be at y=7 until turn17 or later.\n\nSo we must be at y=6 at turn16.\n\nThen at turn16: we can go to y=7.\n\nHow to be at y=6 at turn16?\n\nWe need to arrive at y=6 at turn16.\n\nWe are at y=2 at turn10.\n\nWe need to go from y=2 to y=6: 4 steps.\n\nFrom turn10 to turn16: 6 turns.\n\nSo we have 6 turns to gain 4 steps. We can have 2 waits.\n\nWe can insert two waits anywhere between turn10 and turn16.\n\nFor example:\n\n turn10: U -> y=3\n turn11: U -> y=4\n turn12: U -> y=5\n turn13: U -> y=6  -> now at y=6 at turn14.\n turn14: S -> y=6\n turn15: S -> y=6\n turn16: U -> y=7\n\nThen:\n turn17: U -> y=8\n turn18: U -> y=9\n\nSo we reach y=9 at turn19, same as before.\n\nOr we can wait earlier:\n\n turn10: S -> y=2\n turn11: S -> y=2\n turn12: U -> y=3\n turn13: U -> y=4\n turn14: U -> y=5\n turn15: U -> y=6\n turn16: U -> y=7\n turn17: U -> y=8\n turn18: U -> y=9\n\nSame number of turns.\n\nIs there a way to save a turn? For example, by being at y=9 at turn18.\n\nThat would require being at y=8 at turn17, and then U at turn17 to y=9 at turn18.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at turn17, we must have been at y=7 at turn16.\n\nBut freeway7 at turn16 is dangerous -> crash.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=7 at turn16.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=7 is turn17.\n\nThen y=8 at turn18, and y=9 at turn19.\n\nSo we cannot finish before turn19.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 12 actions, from turn7 to turn18.\n\nNow, let's write the actions:\n\nTurn7: D\nTurn8: S\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U  # to y=3 at turn11\nBut wait, let's list the state at each turn to be sure.\n\nWe'll list absolute turn, action, and resulting y at next turn.\n\nStart: turn7, y=2.\n\nAction at turn7: D -> y=1 at turn8.\nAction at turn8: S -> y=1 at turn9.\nAction at turn9: U -> y=2 at turn10.\nAction at turn10: U -> y=3 at turn11.\nAction at turn11: U -> y=4 at turn12.\nAction at turn12: U -> y=5 at turn13.\nAction at turn13: U -> y=6 at turn14.\nAction at turn14: S -> y=6 at turn15.\nAction at turn15: S -> y=6 at turn16.\nAction at turn16: U -> y=7 at turn17.\nAction at turn17: U -> y=8 at turn18.\nAction at turn18: U -> y=9 at turn19.\n\nSo the sequence of actions for turns 7 to 18:\n\nTurn 7: D\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: S\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n\nTotal 12 actions.\n\nNow, we must verify no collision:\n\n- At turn7: y=2 -> freeway2. Is freeway2 dangerous at turn7? No (only 8,9).\n- At turn8: y=1 -> freeway1: safe.\n- At turn9: y=1 -> freeway1: safe.\n- At turn10: y=2 -> freeway2: safe (after turn9).\n- At turn11: y=3 -> freeway3: safe (only dangerous at 8,9).\n- At turn12: y=4 -> freeway4: safe.\n- At turn13: y=5 -> freeway5: safe.\n- At turn14: y=6 -> freeway6: safe.\n- At turn15: y=6 -> freeway6: safe.\n- At turn16: y=6 -> freeway6: safe.\n- At turn17: y=7 -> freeway7: at turn17, dangerous times were 8,9,15,16 -> 17 is safe.\n- At turn18: y=8 -> freeway8: safe (turn18 not in 8,9,15,16).\n\nAnd then at turn19: y=9, not on any freeway.\n\nSo safe.\n\nIs there a way with H=11? That would mean we are at y=9 at turn18.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn18, we must be at y=8 at turn17 (after action at turn17).\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn17, we must be at y=7 at turn16.\n\nBut freeway7 at turn16 is dangerous -> collision.\n\nTherefore, not possible.\n\nHence, minimal H=12.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: D\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: S\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says the current turn is t1=7, and we output from turn7 to turn7+11=18? H=12, so turns from 7 to 18 (inclusive) is 12 turns.\n\nYes.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) is 12. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by moving down to \\(y = 1\\) to avoid the initial dangerous period (turns 8 and 9), waiting at \\(y = 1\\) during turn 9, and then moving up. To avoid the later dangerous period on freeways 7 and 8 (turns 15 and 16), the player waits at \\(y = 6\\) for two turns (turns 14 and 15) before proceeding to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- Turn 7: Move down (D) to avoid collision on freeway 2 at turn 8.\n- Turn 8: Stay (S) to remain at safe freeway 1 during turn 9.\n- Turn 9: Move up (U) to freeway 2, which is safe after turn 9.\n- Turns 10–13: Move up (U) repeatedly to progress through safe freeways.\n- Turns 14–15: Stay (S) at freeway 6 to avoid freeways 7 and 8 during turns 15 and 16.\n- Turns 16–18: Move up (U) repeatedly to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 19 (i.e., after 12 actions starting from turn 7), with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: D \\\\\nTurn 8: S \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: S \\\\\nTurn 15: S \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U\n}",

The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move continuously based on their speed and direction. For left-moving cars, the span decreases, and for right-moving, it increases. But all cars listed are right-moving, since direction is \"right\" and speed is positive.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is at y_T and 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn. Importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is the top, and since y=9 has no cars (freeways are y=1 to 8), once I'm on y=9, I'm safe, and I don't need to worry about cars anymore. But I need to get there without getting hit on the way.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1 = 8, player at (0,1).\n\nNow, let's list the car states for each freeway at turn t_1=8.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (head=24, tail=13, right, speed=12). Since it's right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it says (24, 13, right, 12). But head and tail: if it's right-moving, and head=24, tail=13, that would mean tail is smaller, so span [13,24]? But in the update, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h] for right-moving? Let's read carefully.\n\nThe car update: for car k, at t_1, head h, tail τ.\n\nThen for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h]? But in the example, h=24, τ=13, so if τ=13, h=24, then Span(t_1) = [13,24], and since right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] where ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all here are right.\n\nIn the collision rule, collision if 0 in Span(T) for the freeway at y_T.\n\n0 is the x-position where the player is, I assume, since player is at (0,y) always.\n\nNow, for freeway 1: car (24,13,right,12) so at t_1=8, span [13,24], speed 12 right, so at time T, span [13 + 12(T-8), 24 + 12(T-8)]\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2: (0,-11,right,6) so span at t_1: [τ,h] = [-11,0], since τ=-11, h=0? Head and tail: it says (0,-11,right,6), so I think head=0, tail=-11, so span [ -11, 0 ] at t_1.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3,4,5,6: all same as freeway 2, each has one car (0,-11,right,6), so span [-11,0] at t_1.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (0,-11,right,6), (36,25,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (0,-11,right,6) → span [-11,0] at t_1\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,6) → head=36, tail=25? Span [25,36] at t_1? But it says (36,25), so if head=36, tail=25, span [25,36] for right-moving.\n\nThird car: (-42,-53,right,6) → head=-42, tail=-53, so span [-53,-42] at t_1.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8: same as freeway 7, three cars with same parameters.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 both have three cars: (0,-11,right,6), (36,25,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nNow, I need to find when these spans cover x=0 for each freeway at each turn.\n\nBut collision only if at turn T, player is on that freeway and 0 in span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSince player starts at y=1 at t=8.\n\nI need to go from y=1 to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be small if I can go up quickly, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, at which turns 0 is covered.\n\nDefine ΔT = T - t_1 = T - 8\n\nFor a car on freeway k, with span at T: for right-moving, [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT]\n\n0 in span if τ + s ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + s ΔT\n\nSince the span is [low, high] with low = τ + s ΔT, high = h + s ΔT for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for left, but all right here.\n\nSo 0 in [low, high] iff low ≤ 0 ≤ high.\n\nNow for each car, we can find the range of ΔT where this is true.\n\nThen for a freeway, if any car has 0 in span, then the freeway is occupied at that T.\n\nPlayer must not be on that freeway at that turn.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and the critical times.\n\nStart with freeway 1: only one car, h=24, τ=13, s=12, right.\n\nSpan at T: [13 + 12ΔT, 24 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in this if 13 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 24 + 12ΔT\n\nSince 13 + 12ΔT > 0 for ΔT >=0, because at ΔT=0, 13 >0, and increases, so low =13+12ΔT >0 for all ΔT>=0, so 0 < low <= high, so 0 not in [low,high] for any ΔT. Thus, freeway 1 is never occupied? Let's see.\n\n13 + 12ΔT <=0? 12ΔT <= -13, ΔT <= -13/12 ≈ -1.083, but ΔT = T-8 >=0 since T >= t_1, so for ΔT>=0, low >=13>0, so 0 < low, not <= low, so 0 not in span. Similarly, high=24+12ΔT>0, but low>0 so 0 not in interval.\n\nThus, for freeway 1, no car ever covers x=0 at any T>=8. So freeway 1 is always safe? But let's confirm.\n\nThe car is at [13,24] at ΔT=0, moving right, so it started from left and is going right, so at some point it might have covered 0, but at T=8, it's at [13,24], and moving away, so indeed, for T>=8, it never covers 0. So freeway 1 is safe at all times.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car (0,-11,right,6) so h=0, τ=-11, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-11 + 6ΔT, 0 + 6ΔT]\n\n0 in this if -11 + 6ΔT <= 0 <= 0 + 6ΔT\n\n0 <= 6ΔT is always true for ΔT>=0, since 6ΔT >=0.\n\nAnd -11 + 6ΔT <=0 implies 6ΔT <=11, ΔT <= 11/6 ≈ 1.833\n\nSo for ΔT <= 11/6, 0 in span.\n\nΔT from 0 to 11/6 ≈1.833, so at T=8,9,10? T=8: ΔT=0, span [-11,0], 0<=0 and -11<=0, yes, 0 in span.\n\nT=9: ΔT=1, span [-11+6= -5, 0+6=6], -5<=0<=6, yes.\n\nT=10: ΔT=2, span [-11+12=1, 0+12=12], 1<=0? 1<=0 is false, 0<1, so 0 not <= high? low=1, high=12, 0 < low, so not in span.\n\nT=11: ΔT=3, span [7,18], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 2, occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, one car (0,-11,right,6), so occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway 4: same, occupied T=8,9.\n\nFreeway 5: same, occupied T=8,9.\n\nFreeway 6: same, occupied T=8,9.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (0,-11,right,6) same as above, span [-11+6ΔT, 0+6ΔT], so 0 in span when -11+6ΔT <=0 <=6ΔT, which is ΔT <= 11/6, so T=8,9.\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,6) head=36, tail=25, so span at T: [25 +6ΔT, 36 +6ΔT]\n\n25+6ΔT >0 for ΔT>=0, so low>0, 0 not in span.\n\nThird car: (-42,-53,right,6) head=-42, tail=-53, span [-53 +6ΔT, -42 +6ΔT]\n\n-42 +6ΔT <=0? -42 +6ΔT <=0 implies 6ΔT <=42, ΔT<=7.\n\nBut 0 <= -42 +6ΔT? 0 <= -42 +6ΔT implies 42 <=6ΔT, ΔT >=7.\n\nAnd low <=0: -53+6ΔT <=0 implies 6ΔT <=53, ΔT <=53/6≈8.833\n\n0 in [low, high] if low <=0 <= high.\n\nlow = -53 +6ΔT\n\nhigh = -42 +6ΔT\n\nSo low <=0 <= high\n\nFirst, low <=0: -53 +6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=53 => ΔT <= 53/6 ≈8.833\n\nSecond, 0 <= high: 0 <= -42 +6ΔT => 42 <=6ΔT => ΔT >=7\n\nSo for ΔT between 7 and 8.833, i.e., T=15,16? ΔT=7,8\n\nT= t_1 + ΔT =8 + ΔT\n\nΔT >=7: T=15,16,17,... but ΔT<=8.833, so T=15,16 since T integer.\n\nΔT=7: T=8+7=15\n\nΔT=8: T=16\n\nΔT=9: T=17, but ΔT=9>8.833, 6*9=54, low=-53+54=1>0, so not.\n\nSo third car covers at T=15 and T=16.\n\nNow for freeway 7, occupied when any car covers 0.\n\nFirst car covers at T=8,9\n\nSecond car never covers 0\n\nThird car covers at T=15,16\n\nSo freeway 7 occupied at T=8,9,15,16\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same cars, so also occupied at T=8,9,15,16\n\nNow freeway 1 is always safe, as we saw.\n\nPlayer starts at y=1 at t=8.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=1 is freeway 1, y=2 is freeway 2, etc., up to y=8 freeway 8.\n\nAt turn T, player is at y_T, and we check the freeway at that y.\n\nAt t=8, player at y=1, freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 is safe at all times, as we said, no car covers 0.\n\nBut at t=8, for freeway 1, we have a car, but it doesn't cover 0, so safe.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no cars, safe.\n\nThe path: from y=1 to y=9, we need to pass through y=2 to y=8, but we can skip some if we move fast, but since we move one y at a time, we have to go through each y sequentially, I think, but we can stay or move up/down, but to reach 9 from 1, we probably want to go up.\n\nMinimal turns: if I go up every turn, from y=1 to y=9, it takes 8 moves: at turn 8, y=1; after one up, turn 9, y=2; turn 10, y=3; ... up to turn 15, y=8; then turn 16, y=9.\n\nFrom t=8, y=1.\n\nAfter first action, at t=9, y = y_1 + Δy, depending on action at t=8.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, player performs action a_t, then y_{t+1} is updated.\n\nSo at turn t, player is at position (0, y_t), then chooses a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAnd at turn t, we check collision based on y_t and the cars at that turn.\n\nIn the collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nSo at turn T, player is at y_T, and we check the freeway at y_T for that turn.\n\nNow, for the action: if at turn T, I choose to move up, for example, a_T = U, then y_{T+1} = y_T + 1.\n\nBut at turn T, I am still at y_T, and I might be collided if on that freeway and 0 covered.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am at y_{T+1}.\n\nSimilarly for other actions.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, starting from y=1 at t=8.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nSince y changes by at most 1 per turn, the minimal number of turns from y=1 to y=9 is 8 turns, if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions, which might take more turns.\n\nFirst, let's see if going straight up is possible.\n\nStart at t=8, y=1.\n\nFreeway 1: safe, as we said.\n\nAction at t=8: if I go up, a_8 = U, then at t=9, y=2.\n\nAt t=9, y=2.\n\nFreeway 2: at t=9, occupied, as we saw, since for freeway 2, occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nAt T=9, freeway 2 is occupied, so if I am on y=2 at t=9, I collide.\n\nThus, if I go up at t=8 to y=2 at t=9, I collide at t=9.\n\nIf I stay at t=8, a_8 = S, then at t=9, y still 1.\n\nAt t=9, y=1, freeway 1: safe.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nNow at t=9, if I go up, a_9 = U, then at t=10, y=2.\n\nNow at t=10, y=2, freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 at t=10: earlier, we saw for freeway 2, occupied only at t=8 and t=9, not at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, ΔT=2, span for freeway 2 car: [ -11 +6*2, 0 +6*2] = [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], low=1>0, so 0 not in span, safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways might be issue.\n\nAt t=10, y=2, freeway 2 safe.\n\nThen I can go up to y=3 at t=11, and so on.\n\nBut let's see the occupancy for each freeway over time.\n\nFirst, list for each freeway the turns when it is occupied, i.e., when 0 is covered by some car.\n\nFreeway 1: never occupied for T>=8.\n\nFreeway 2: occupied at T=8,9\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2, occupied T=8,9\n\nFreeway 4: same, occupied T=8,9\n\nFreeway 5: same, occupied T=8,9\n\nFreeway 6: same, occupied T=8,9\n\nFreeway 7: occupied at T=8,9 (from first car) and T=15,16 (from third car)\n\nFreeway 8: same, occupied at T=8,9,15,16\n\nNow, player starts at t=8, y=1.\n\ny=1 is safe at t=8.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is always safe.\n\nThe critical part is to avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nSince I start at y=1, and y=1 is always safe, I can stay or move.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nNow, freeways 2-6 are occupied at t=8 and t=9, but safe from t=10 onwards.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 and 8 are occupied at t=8,9 and also at t=15,16.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid the occupied times.\n\nFor example, from t=10 onwards, freeways 2-6 are safe, but at t=10, if I am at y=2, it's safe, as above.\n\nBut I need to get to higher y.\n\nLet's think about the path.\n\nOption 1: go up immediately but delay to avoid t=9 on y=2.\n\nAt t=8, y=1, safe.\n\nIf I go up at t=8, to y=2 at t=9, but at t=9 y=2 is occupied, collision.\n\nSo cannot go up at t=8.\n\nMust stay or go down, but going down to y=0 might not help, and y=0 is boundary, but y=0 has no cars? Freeways from y=1 to 8, so y=0 should be safe, but I need to go to y=9, so going down might waste time.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\nSo better to stay or go up when possible.\n\nAt t=8, I can do S or D.\n\nIf S, at t=9, y=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=9, I can go up to y=2 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, y=2, freeway 2 safe, as we saw.\n\nThen I can go up to y=3 at t=11, and so on.\n\nNow, let's see for higher y.\n\nFreeways 3 to 6 are similar, occupied only at t=8,9, so from t=10 onwards, all safe until y=6 or so.\n\ny=7 and y=8 have additional issues at t=15,16.\n\nBut first, let's assume I go up steadily from t=9 onwards.\n\nStart: t=8, y=1, action: since going up now causes collision at t=9, so I should not go up at t=8.\n\nSo at t=8, action S or D.\n\nIf S, stay at y=1.\n\nThen t=9, y=1, action: I can go U to y=2 at t=10.\n\nt=10, y=2, safe.\n\nThen I can go U to y=3 at t=11.\n\nt=11, y=3, freeway 3: occupied only at t=8,9, so at t=11 safe.\n\nSimilarly, go U to y=4 at t=12.\n\nt=12, y=4, safe.\n\nU to y=5 at t=13.\n\nt=13, y=5, safe.\n\nU to y=6 at t=14.\n\nt=14, y=6, safe? Freeway 6 occupied only t=8,9, so yes.\n\nNow U to y=7 at t=15.\n\nt=15, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 occupied at t=15? Yes, from the third car, as we calculated.\n\nAt t=15, ΔT=7, for freeway 7 third car, low = -53 +6*7 = -53+42= -11, high= -42 +42=0? ΔT=7, s=6, low= -53 + 6*7 = -53+42= -11, high= -42 +42=0.\n\nSo span [-11,0], and 0 <=0 and -11<=0, so 0 in span, yes occupied.\n\nSimilarly, at t=16, also occupied.\n\nSo at t=15, if I am on y=7, I collide.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf I go to y=7 at t=15, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=8 at t=16, freeway 8 occupied at t=16.\n\nt=16, ΔT=8, for freeway 8, similar to 7, occupied.\n\nBut at t=15, y=7 occupied.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=14, y=6, then I go U to y=7 at t=15, but y=7 occupied at t=15.\n\nSo collision.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=7 at t=15 or t=16.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at t=15 or t=16? Freeway 8 occupied t=15,16.\n\nNow, what about other times?\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 are safe except at t=8,9,15,16.\n\nt=8,9 are past or soon, but at t=10 to 14, they might be safe.\n\nFor example, freeway 7: at t=10, ΔT=2, first car span: [-11+12, 0+12]= [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [25+12,36+12]=[37,48], no.\n\nThird car: [-53+12, -42+12]= [-41,-30], low=-41<0, high=-30<0, so 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, t=11: ΔT=3, first: [-11+18,18]= [7,18], no\n\nSecond: [25+18,36+18]=[43,54], no\n\nThird: [-53+18,-42+18]= [-35,-24], no\n\nt=12: ΔT=4, first: [-11+24,24]= [13,24], no\n\nThird: [-53+24,-42+24]= [-29,-18], no\n\nt=13: ΔT=5, first: [19,30], no\n\nThird: [-53+30,-42+30]= [-23,-12], no? low=-23<0, high=-12<0, 0 not in.\n\nt=14: ΔT=6, first: [-11+36,36]= [25,36], no\n\nThird: [-53+36,-42+36]= [-17,-6], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nt=15: ΔT=7, first: [-11+42,42]= [31,42], no? First car at t=15: s=6, ΔT=7, -11 +42=31? Earlier I had for third car.\n\nFor freeway 7, first car: (0,-11,right,6), at T, span [-11 +6ΔT, 0 +6ΔT]\n\nAt t=15, ΔT=7, [-11+42, 0+42] = [31,42], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: not relevant.\n\nThird car: (-42,-53,right,6), at T, span [-53 +6ΔT, -42 +6ΔT]\n\nAt t=15, ΔT=7, [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11, 0], so 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly, t=16, ΔT=8, [-53+48, -42+48] = [-5,6], -5<=0<=6, yes.\n\nt=17, ΔT=9, [-53+54, -42+54] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 7 occupied only at t=15 and t=16? But earlier I thought t=8,9 also, but t=8,9 from first car.\n\nAt t=8 and t=9, first car covers 0.\n\nBut at t=15 and t=16, third car covers 0.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nSo occupied at t=8,9,15,16 for y=7 and y=8.\n\nNow back to the path.\n\nIf I go up from t=9 to t=10: y=2 at t=10\n\nThen to y=3 at t=11\n\ny=4 at t=12\n\ny=5 at t=13\n\ny=6 at t=14\n\nNow at t=14, y=6.\n\nIf I go up to y=7 at t=15, but t=15 y=7 occupied, collision.\n\nI could stay at y=6 for a turn or go down, but that might delay.\n\nI could reach y=7 earlier or later.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=7 before t=15 or after t=16.\n\nt=15 and t=16 occupied, so safe at t=10 to 14 and t=17 onwards for y=7.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, from the sequence, at t=14, I am at y=6.\n\nI need to go to y=7, but not at t=15 or t=16.\n\nSo I can go to y=7 at t=17 or later, but that would take more turns.\n\nSince y=6 is safe at t=14, I could stay at y=6 for one or more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=14, y=6, I can do S, stay at y=6 for t=15.\n\nAt t=15, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6: occupied only at t=8,9, so at t=15, safe.\n\nThen at t=15, I can do S again or go U.\n\nIf I go U at t=15 to y=7 at t=16.\n\nBut at t=16, y=7, freeway 7 occupied at t=16, collision.\n\nIf I stay at t=15, y=6, then at t=16, I can go U to y=7 at t=17.\n\nAt t=17, y=7, freeway 7: at t=17, ΔT=9, as above, not occupied, safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut let's see the turns.\n\nCurrent: start t=8, y=1\n\nAction t=8: S (stay), to t=9 y=1\n\nAction t=9: U, to t=10 y=2\n\nt=10: U, to t=11 y=3\n\nt=11: U, to t=12 y=4\n\nt=12: U, to t=13 y=5\n\nt=13: U, to t=14 y=6\n\nNow at t=14, y=6\n\nInstead of going up, I stay: action S, to t=15 y=6 (safe)\n\nThen at t=15, I cannot go up to y=7 at t=16 because t=16 y=7 occupied.\n\nSo I must stay or go down, but go down wastes.\n\nSo at t=15, action S, to t=16 y=6\n\nThen at t=16, action U, to t=17 y=7\n\nt=17, y=7, freeway 7: t=17, ΔT=9, as above, not occupied, safe.\n\nThen action U, to t=18 y=8\n\nt=18, y=8, freeway 8: at t=18, ΔT=10, first car span: [-11+60,60]= [49,60], no\n\nThird car: [-53+60, -42+60]= [7,18], no, so safe.\n\nThen action U, to t=19 y=9, done.\n\nH=19 - 8 +1? Turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nStarted at turn t_1=8, after H turns, at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, after action, position at t+1.\n\nAt turn T, position is y_T.\n\nAfter H actions, from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, the position is y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn this sequence: actions at t=8 to t=18, that's 11 actions? List:\n\nt=8: action S, position at t=9: y=1\n\nBetter to list the action and resulting position.\n\nTurn: action, then position at next turn.\n\nAt turn 8: we are at y=1, we choose action for turn 8.\n\nAfter action, at turn 9, new y.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSequence:\n\n- Turn 8: action, then turn 9 y\n\nI need to output actions for turns starting from t_1.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\n- At turn 8: action S → at turn 9, y=1\n\n- Turn 9: action U → at turn 10, y=2\n\n- Turn 10: U → turn 11, y=3\n\n- Turn 11: U → turn 12, y=4\n\n- Turn 12: U → turn 13, y=5\n\n- Turn 13: U → turn 14, y=6\n\n- Turn 14: S → turn 15, y=6\n\n- Turn 15: S → turn 16, y=6\n\n- Turn 16: U → turn 17, y=7\n\n- Turn 17: U → turn 18, y=8\n\n- Turn 18: U → turn 19, y=9\n\nNow, at turn 19, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 8 to turn 18, that's 11 actions? Turns: t=8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18: 11 turns.\n\nH should be the number of turns, from t=8 to t=8+H-1.\n\nStarted at t=8, after H actions, we are at turn t=8+H-1.\n\nAt turn t=8+H-1, y=9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 19, y=9, so 8 + H -1 =19, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nt=8+H-1=19, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nBut actions from t=8 to t=18, which is 11 actions? t=8 to t=18 inclusive is 11 turns: 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18.\n\nYes, 11 actions to reach position at t=19.\n\nSince we start at t=8 position, after first action at t=8, position at t=9; after second at t=9, position at t=10, ..., after k actions, position at t=8+k.\n\nTo have y_{t_8 + k} =9.\n\nSet t_8 + k = T, y_T=9.\n\nWith k actions.\n\nIn above, at T=19, y=9, so k=11 actions? From action at t=8 to t=18, that's 11 actions, leading to position at t=9 to t=19.\n\nAfter action at t=8, position at t=9; after action at t=18, position at t=19.\n\nSo with 11 actions, we reach position at t=19.\n\nBut we started at t=8 with position, so the number of turns to reach is 11 actions, but the turn index increases.\n\nH is the minimal number of turns, meaning the number of actions taken.\n\nIn the problem: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\"\n\nSo actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter these H actions, at turn t_1 + H, the position is y_{t_1 + H}, but no.\n\nAt turn t, before action, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, position y_{t+1} is set.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to reach y_T =9, we need that at some turn T, y_T=9.\n\nThe actions are taken from turn t_1 to turn T-1, so that y_T is set based on a_{T-1}.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at turn T, we need to have moved there from turn T-1.\n\nSpecifically, at turn T-1, we must be at y=8 or y=9 or y=10, but y=10 invalid, so y=8 or y=9, and choose U or S accordingly.\n\nBut since we want to reach y=9, and it might be from below.\n\nIn this case, from start at t=8, y=1.\n\nWe take actions at t=8, t=9, ..., up to t=T-1, to reach y_T=9.\n\nNumber of actions H = T - t_1.\n\nSince from t_1 to T-1, that's T - t_1 actions.\n\nThen at turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nWith H actions, we reach position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBecause after H actions, from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nSet y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn above sequence, we reached y=9 at turn 19.\n\nt_1=8, so t_1 + H =19, so H=11.\n\nH=11 actions.\n\nBut can we do with less?\n\nFor example, if we can avoid the delay.\n\nEarlier at t=14, y=6, instead of staying, can we go directly to y=7 before t=15.\n\nBut at t=14, y=6, if I go U, to y=7 at t=15, but t=15 occupied.\n\nIf I go to y=7 earlier.\n\nBut to reach y=7 earlier, I need to start going up earlier.\n\nBut at the beginning, I had to wait at y=1 for one turn because going up immediately causes collision at y=2 t=9.\n\nSo from t=8 to t=14, I went from y=1 to y=6 in 6 actions? Let's see the timing.\n\nAt t=8: start y=1\n\nAfter actions:\n\nt=8: S → t=9 y=1\n\nt=9: U → t=10 y=2\n\nt=10: U → t=11 y=3\n\nt=11: U → t=12 y=4\n\nt=12: U → t=13 y=5\n\nt=13: U → t=14 y=6\n\nSo from t=9 to t=14, y from 1 to 6, but at t=14 y=6.\n\nTo reach y=6 at t=14, with actions from t=8 to t=13: 6 actions? Actions at t=8 to t=13, that's 6 actions, position at t=14.\n\nt=8 action to t=9 pos, ..., t=13 action to t=14 pos.\n\nYes.\n\nNow from y=6 at t=14, I need to go to y=7.\n\nBut y=7 occupied at t=15 and t=16.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=7 at t=15 or t=16.\n\nI can be on y=7 at t=17, for example.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at t=17, I need to move from y=6 to y=7 at some turn between.\n\nAt turn t, if I am at y=6, and I go U, then at t+1, y=7.\n\nSo if I go U at t=16, then at t=17 y=7.\n\nSimilarly, at t=14, I am at y=6.\n\nIf I go U at t=14, to t=15 y=7, collision.\n\nSo I must not go U at t=14.\n\nI could stay at y=6 for some turns.\n\nAt t=14, action S, to t=15 y=6\n\nThen at t=15, action S, to t=16 y=6\n\nThen at t=16, action U, to t=17 y=7\n\nThen at t=17, action U, to t=18 y=8\n\nThen at t=18, action U, to t=19 y=9\n\nAs before.\n\nFrom y=6 to y=9, it takes 3 more actions, but with 2 stays, so to t=19.\n\nCan I go to y=7 at t=17 directly from y=6 at t=16? Same as above.\n\nBut to have y=7 at t=17, I need to be at y=6 at t=16 and go U.\n\nBut at t=16, if I am at y=6, I can go U to y=7 at t=17.\n\nBut to be at y=6 at t=16, I need to have stayed or something.\n\nFrom earlier, at t=14 y=6, I can stay at t=14 and t=15 to be at y=6 at t=16, then go U at t=16 to y=7 at t=17.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIs there a way to be at y=7 earlier than t=17?\n\ny=7 is safe at t=10 to t=14 and t=17 onwards.\n\nt=10 to t=14: 5 turns.\n\nBut to reach y=7, from y=1.\n\nMinimal time to reach y=7 from y=1 is 6 moves: e.g., from t=8 y=1, go U at t=8 to y=2 at t=9, but collision at t=9 on y=2.\n\nCannot.\n\nThen next, go U at t=9 to y=2 at t=10, safe.\n\nThen U to y=3 at t=11, ..., U to y=7 at t=14? Let's see:\n\nStart t=8 y=1\n\nIf I could go U at t=8, but cannot because collision at t=9.\n\nSo must delay.\n\nEarliest: at t=8 S to y=1 t=9\n\nt=9 U to y=2 t=10\n\nt=10 U to y=3 t=11\n\nt=11 U to y=4 t=12\n\nt=12 U to y=5 t=13\n\nt=13 U to y=6 t=14\n\nt=14 U to y=7 t=15 → but t=15 occupied, cannot.\n\nSo cannot reach y=7 at t=14 or t=15.\n\nAt t=14, if I go U, y=7 at t=15, collision.\n\nIf I don't go U at t=13, but stay earlier, but that would make me reach y=6 later, so y=7 even later.\n\nFor example, if I stay at t=8, S, t=9 y=1\n\nThen U at t=9 to y=2 t=10, same as before.\n\nIf I stay multiple times, worse.\n\nSo the earliest I can be at y=7 is t=17, by staying at y=6 for two turns.\n\nThen y=8 at t=18, y=9 at t=19.\n\nBut y=8 at t=18 is safe, as freeway 8 not occupied at t=18.\n\nSimilarly, I could go directly to y=9 from y=8 or something, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=1 is always safe, I could go down to y=0, but y=0 is safe, but then I need to come back, which takes more turns, so not helpful.\n\nPerhaps for y=7 and y=8, I can pass during safe times.\n\nBut the safe times for y=7 are t=10 to t=14 and t=17 onwards.\n\nt=10 to t=14 is early, but I cannot reach y=7 by t=14 because of the initial delay.\n\nFrom above, I can be at y=6 at t=14.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=14, I would need to be at y=6 at t=13 and go U at t=13 to y=7 at t=14.\n\nBut at t=13, I am at y=5? In the sequence, at t=13, after action U at t=12, y=5 at t=13? Let's see positions:\n\nt=8: y=1\n\nAfter t=8 S: t=9 y=1\n\nt=9 U: t=10 y=2\n\nt=10 U: t=11 y=3\n\nt=11 U: t=12 y=4\n\nt=12 U: t=13 y=5\n\nt=13 U: t=14 y=6\n\nSo at t=13, position y=5.\n\nTo reach y=7 at t=14, I would need to go from y=5 to y=7 in one turn, but I can only change by 1 per turn, so impossible.\n\nSo y=7 at t=14 impossible.\n\nSimilarly, at t=13, y=5, if I go U to y=6 at t=14, then to y=7 at t=15, but t=15 occupied.\n\nNo way to reach y=7 before t=17 without colliding.\n\nt=17 is the earliest.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, I have to go to y=8 as well.\n\nAt t=17 y=7, go U to y=8 at t=18.\n\nt=18, y=8 safe, as freeway 8 not occupied.\n\nThen U to y=9 at t=19.\n\nH=11 actions, from t=8 to t=18.\n\nBut perhaps I can reduce the stays.\n\nFor example, at y=6, I stayed two turns: t=14 and t=15.\n\nBut at t=14 and t=15, I stayed at y=6.\n\nBut y=6 is safe at those times, but I could have gone to y=5 or something, but that might not help.\n\nSince freeway 7 and 8 are safe at t=10-14, if I can be at y=7 or y=8 during t=10-14.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at say t=12, for example.\n\nBut from start, at t=8 y=1.\n\nTo reach y=7 at t=12, I need 5 up moves.\n\nBut with actions from t=8 to t=11.\n\nAt t=8: if U, to y=2 at t=9, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nAt t=8 S to y=1 t=9\n\nThen at t=9 U to y=2 t=10 (safe)\n\nt=10 U to y=3 t=11\n\nt=11 U to y=4 t=12\n\nt=12 U to y=5 t? After t=11 action, position at t=12.\n\nTo have y=7 at t=12, I need position at t=12 to be y=7.\n\nThat means at t=11, I must be at y=6 or y=7 or y=8, and go U or S or D, but to be y=7, if at t=11 y=6, go U; if y=7, go S; etc.\n\nBut at t=11, what is possible.\n\nFrom t=8: actions\n\nt=8: S → t=9 y=1\n\nt=9: U → t=10 y=2\n\nt=10: U → t=11 y=3\n\nAt t=11, position y=3.\n\nI can go U to y=4 at t=12.\n\nCannot reach y=7 at t=12.\n\nSimilarly, earliest at t=11 is y=3, t=12 y=4, t=13 y=5, t=14 y=6, t=15 y=7 but collision.\n\nSo no, cannot reach high y early.\n\nThus, the sequence I have seems necessary.\n\nBut H=11, from t=8 to t=18 actions, reach y=9 at t=19.\n\nBut the problem is to minimize H, so is there a shorter way?\n\nPerhaps I can go down to y=0 and come back, but that would take more turns, since y=0 to y=9 is 9 moves, from y=1 down to y=0 then up, worse.\n\nOr, for the upper freeways, since I have to avoid t=15,16, but I can be on y=7 or y=8 at other times.\n\nBut I cannot reach earlier.\n\nAnother thought: at t=14, y=6, instead of staying, I could go down to y=5, but then I have to go up again, which takes more actions, so H larger, not better.\n\nFor example, go down to y=5 at t=15, then need to go back to y=6, etc., worse.\n\nSo not good.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, I can go directly if possible, but no.\n\nOr, since y=9 is safe, and I can reach it from y=8.\n\nBut I need to pass y=7 and y=8.\n\nUnless I can skip, but I can only move one step.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nIn the sequence, I have two S at y=6.\n\nBut at t=15, when I stay at y=6, freeway 6 is safe, as occupied only t=8,9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I can reduce one stay if I go to y=7 later but faster, but no.\n\nAnother idea: after reaching y=6, I can go to y=7 at t=17, but I need to fill the time.\n\nAt t=14, y=6, I must not go to y=7 until t=16 action to y=17 position.\n\nSo I need to be at y=6 or other for t=15 and t=16 position? At turn t=15, position y must not be 7 or 8, since occupied.\n\nBut y=6 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=16, position y must not be 7 or 8.\n\ny=6 is safe.\n\nSo staying at y=6 is fine.\n\nI could go to y=5, but not necessary.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's see the number.\n\nStart t=8, after 0 actions, at y=1.\n\nAfter 1 action: at t=9, y=1 (if S)\n\nAfter 2 actions: at t=10, y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter 6 actions: at t=14, y=6\n\nThen after 7 actions: at t=15, y=6 (S)\n\nAfter 8 actions: at t=16, y=6 (S)\n\nAfter 9 actions: at t=17, y=7 (U from t=16)\n\nAfter 10 actions: at t=18, y=8 (U)\n\nAfter 11 actions: at t=19, y=9 (U)\n\nSo with 11 actions, reach y=9 at t=19.\n\nH=11.\n\nSequence of actions:\n\nTurn t_1: S (for turn 8)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: U (turn 9)\n\n...\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nThen at turn 19, y=9.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nWith H=10 actions, from t=8 to t=17, position at t=18 should be y=9.\n\nt_1 + H = t=8 +10=18, y=9.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at t=18.\n\nThat means at t=17, I must be at y=8 or y=9, and go U or S to y=9 at t=18.\n\nIf at t=17 y=8, go U; if y=9, go S.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, so probably from y=8.\n\nNow, to be at y=8 at t=17.\n\nBut y=8 occupied at t=15 and t=16? Freeway 8 occupied t=15,16.\n\nAt t=17, y=8 might be safe.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=17.\n\nNow, from start, to reach y=8 at t=17.\n\nEarliest to reach high y.\n\nBut with the initial constraint.\n\nAt t=8 y=1, cannot go U immediately.\n\nSo must: t=8 S to y=1 t=9\n\nt=9 U to y=2 t=10\n\nt=10 U to y=3 t=11\n\nt=11 U to y=4 t=12\n\nt=12 U to y=5 t=13\n\nt=13 U to y=6 t=14\n\nNow at t=14 y=6.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=17, I need to go from y=6 to y=8 in two moves? From t=14 to t=17 position.\n\nAt t=14 y=6.\n\nAction at t=14: if U, to y=7 at t=15, but t=15 y=7 occupied, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf at t=14, I go S to y=6 t=15\n\nThen at t=15, I can go U to y=7 at t=16, but t=16 y=7 occupied? Freeway 7 occupied at t=16, yes, collision.\n\nIf at t=15, I go S to y=6 t=16, then at t=16 go U to y=7 t=17.\n\nThen at t=17 y=7, not y=8.\n\nThen I need another move to y=8 at t=18.\n\nBut for H=10, I need y=9 at t=18, so I need to be at y=8 or y=9 at t=17.\n\nBut if at t=17 y=7, I go U to y=8 at t=18, then I need to go to y=9 at t=19, which is later.\n\nWith actions up to t=17, position at t=18 is y=8, not y=9.\n\nTo have y=9 at t=18, I need to be at y=8 at t=17 and go U, or at y=9 and go S.\n\nBut from above, at t=17, I can be at y=7, as above, not y=8.\n\nCan I be at y=8 at t=17?\n\nFor example, from t=14 y=6, if I could go to y=8 directly, impossible.\n\nOr, if I were at higher y earlier, but I cannot.\n\nSuppose at t=13 y=5, I go U to y=6 t=14.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf I go faster initially, but cannot because of t=9.\n\nAnother path: what if at t=8 I go down to y=0? But then at t=9 y=0, safe, but then I need to go up to y=1, etc., which takes more turns to reach high y.\n\nFor example, t=8 D to y=0 t=9? Action D at t=8, y_{t+1} = y_t -1, so from y=1, D, to y=0 at t=9.\n\nThen t=9, at y=0, I can go U to y=1 at t=10.\n\nThen at t=10 y=1, go U to y=2 at t=11, and so on.\n\nBut now at t=10 y=1, t=11 y=2, etc., but freeways 2-6 are safe from t=10 onwards, so I can go up: t=11 y=2, t=12 y=3, ..., up to t=15 y=6? Let's see:\n\nt=9: y=0 (after action at t=8)\n\nt=9: action U → t=10 y=1\n\nt=10: U → t=11 y=2\n\nt=11: U → t=12 y=3\n\nt=12: U → t=13 y=4\n\nt=13: U → t=14 y=5\n\nt=14: U → t=15 y=6\n\nThen at t=15 y=6, now to go to y=7, but t=15 and t=16 occupied for y=7, so I need to stay or wait.\n\nAt t=15, if U to y=7 t=16, collision.\n\nSo must stay at y=6 for t=16, then go U at t=16 to y=7 t=17, etc., same as before but started later.\n\nt=15 y=6, S to y=6 t=16, U to y=7 t=17, U to y=8 t=18, U to y=9 t=19.\n\nSame as before, but I wasted one move going down and up.\n\nt=8 D to y=0 t=9, then U to y=1 t=10, so I used two moves to be at y=1 at t=10, whereas originally I was at y=1 at t=9 with one move (stay), so worse.\n\nThus, not better.\n\nTherefore, the first sequence is better.\n\nSo H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, at turn 14 and 15, I have S, but I could have different actions, but S is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to list the actions.\n\nt_1=8.\n\nActions from t=8 to t=18.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nThen position at turn 19: y=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, t=18 U to y=9 at t=19.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nBut let's write in terms of t_1.\n\nt_1=8.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t_1: S\n\nTurn t_1 +1: U\n\nTurn t_1 +2: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +10: U\n\nt from 0 to H-1, H=11, so t=0 to 10.\n\na_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to 10.\n\nSo:\n\na_{t_1 + 0} = a_8 = S\n\na_{t_1 +1} = a_9 = U\n\na_{t_1 +2} = a_10 = U\n\na_{t_1 +3} = a_11 = U\n\na_{t_1 +4} = a_12 = U\n\na_{t_1 +5} = a_13 = U\n\na_{t_1 +6} = a_14 = S\n\na_{t_1 +7} = a_15 = S\n\na_{t_1 +8} = a_16 = U\n\na_{t_1 +9} = a_17 = U\n\na_{t_1 +10} = a_18 = U\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 +10: a_{t_1 +10}\n\nWith the actions.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, at turn 14 and 15, S and S, which are at t_1+6 and t_1+7.\n\nt_1+6: t=14, action S\n\nt_1+7: t=15, action S\n\nThen t_1+8: t=16, U\n\nt_1+9: t=17, U\n\nt_1+10: t=18, U\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's the minimal.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is freeway 1 really always safe? Yes.\n\nAnd for freeway 7 and 8, at t=17 and t=18, safe, as calculated.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nThus, H=11.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and sequence.\n\nSo in the box.\n\nBut let's write the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11. This sequence involves moving up when possible but staying at \\(y = 6\\) for two turns to avoid the occupied times on freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) at turns 15 and 16.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Justification:\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1):** Always safe, as no car covers x=0 for \\(T \\geq 8\\).\n- **Freeway 2 to 6 (y=2 to y=6):** Occupied only at turns 8 and 9, so safe from turn 10 onwards.\n- **Freeway 7 and 8 (y=7 and y=8):** Occupied at turns 8, 9, 15, and 16, but safe at turns 10-14 and 17 onwards.\n\nThe sequence starts at turn 8 with the player at (0,1). Actions are chosen to:\n- Stay at \\(y=1\\) on turn 8 to avoid moving to \\(y=2\\) on turn 9 (when freeway 2 is occupied).\n- Move up from \\(y=1\\) to \\(y=6\\) from turns 9 to 13.\n- Stay at \\(y=6\\) on turns 14 and 15 to avoid being on \\(y=7\\) or \\(y=8\\) during turns 15 and 16 (when freeways 7 and 8 are occupied).\n- Move up from \\(y=6\\) to \\(y=9\\) from turns 16 to 18, reaching \\(y=9\\) on turn 19.\n\nThe action sequence for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + 10\\) (where \\(t_1 = 8\\)) is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: S \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: S \\\\\nTurn 15: S \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 9, and the player starts at y=1.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. So y is always an integer from 0 to 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T and at that turn, for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span. The span changes over time based on direction and speed.\n\nThe key point is that when you move to a new y, you're not on that new row until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and at turn T+1 you're on y+1. So you only check for collision on the row you're currently on at each turn.\n\nThe player position is given for turn t_1, which is 9. So at turn 9, player is at (0,1). Then we choose actions for turn 9 and onwards.\n\nLet me denote the turns starting from t_1=9. So turn 9: position y=1.\n\nAction a_t is chosen at turn t, and it affects the position at turn t+1. From the update:\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, we check if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T.\n\ny_T is the position at turn T.\n\nSo at turn T, player is at (0, y_T), and we need to check if for that freeway k = y_T, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nThe span at time T is given based on the initial state at t_1=9.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway at turn t_1=9.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=36, tail=25, direction=right, speed=12)\n\nSince it's right-moving, span at time t is [τ + s(t - t_1), h + s(t - t_1)]? Let's see the update.\n\nFrom the rule:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nRight-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left, but here all cars seem to be right-moving from the data.\n\nLet me check the car states:\n\nFreeway 1: (36,25,right,12) — head=36, tail=25, since direction right, at time t_1, span is [tail, head]? No.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail, dir, speed), but for direction, it says \"head\" and \"tail\", but in the update, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" which might be inconsistent.\n\nLook: \"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\"\n\n\"Right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\"\n\nIn the car state table, for freeway 1: (36,25,right,12)\n\nI think \"head\" and \"tail\" are defined with respect to direction. Probably, for a right-moving car, head is the front, which is larger x, tail is smaller x, so at t_1, span is [tail, head] = [25,36] for freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it might be [head, tail] with head smaller or something, but here all are right-moving except possibly others.\n\nLet's see the data:\n\nFreeway 1: (36,25,right,12) — so head=36, tail=25, direction right, so at t_1, span is [25,36] for x-coordinates.\n\nThen at time T, for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [25 + 12(T-9), 36 + 12(T-9)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (6,-5,right,6) — head=6, tail=-5, so at t_1, span [-5,6], at T: [-5 + 6(T-9), 6 + 6(T-9)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (6,-5,right,6) — identical.\n\nFreeway 4: same (6,-5,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: same (6,-5,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: same (6,-5,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (6,-5,right,6), (42,31,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (6,-5,right,6), (42,31,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nFreeways 2 to 6 each have one car: (6,-5,right,6)\n\nFreeway 1 has one car: (36,25,right,12)\n\nFreeways 7 and 8 each have three cars with the same specs.\n\nNow, collision at turn T if player is on freeway y_T and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at time T.\n\nSince the player starts at y=1 at turn 9, and we need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H: since we start at y=1, to reach y=9, we need at least 8 up moves, but we can also move down or stay, so H could be more than 8 if we detour or wait.\n\nBut since we want minimal H, we should go up as much as possible, but we have to avoid the cars.\n\nNow, at each turn, when we are on a row, we must not have a car covering x=0 at that exact turn.\n\nThe player can only be on rows 1 to 8 when moving between, but rows 0 and 9 are safe? y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are starting and ending points, no cars there, so safe.\n\nThe grid has y=0 to 9, but freeways are only y=1 to 8, so on y=0 and y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible. Only on y=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,1) at turn 9, which is on freeway 1.\n\nWe need to get to (0,9), which is not on a freeway, so when we reach y=9, we are done, no collision check needed for y=9.\n\nThe position is (0,y), and we reach (0,9), which is fine.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway and each turn after t_1=9, when x=0 is covered by a car.\n\nSince the spans move, we need to find for each row, when 0 is in the span.\n\nLet t = T - t_1 = T - 9, so time offset from current turn.\n\nFor freeway k, car c, the span at time t_1 + t is [τ + s t, h + s t] for right-moving, since all are right-moving.\n\ns is speed, t is time since t_1.\n\nThen 0 is in span if τ + s t ≤ 0 ≤ h + s t\n\nThat is, 0 ≥ τ + s t and 0 ≤ h + s t\n\nSo for each car, we can find the times when 0 is covered.\n\nThen for a given turn T, if the player is on row k, we need that for all cars on row k, 0 is not covered at T.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and the times when x=0 is occupied.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, h=36, τ=25, s=12, right-moving.\n\nSpan at time t: [25 + 12t, 36 + 12t]\n\n0 in span if 25 + 12t ≤ 0 ≤ 36 + 12t\n\nSince 25 + 12t ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 36 + 12t\n\nBut 25 + 12t ≤ 0 implies t ≤ -25/12 ≈ -2.083, which is before t_1, so for t ≥ 0, 25 + 12t > 0, so 0 < 25 + 12t ≤ 36 + 12t, so 0 is never in the span for t ≥ 0. Because the car is moving right, and at t=0, span [25,36], all positive, so x=0 is not covered, and as it moves right, it covers larger x, so x=0 is never covered for freeway 1 at any time t ≥ 0.\n\nSo freeway 1 is always safe? Let me confirm.\n\nAt t=0, [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nAs t increases, min x increases, so always min x >0, so yes, freeway 1 is safe at all times for the player.\n\nt is time since t_1, so for all T ≥ 9, freeway 1 has no car covering x=0.\n\nGreat, so row 1 is always safe.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car, h=6, τ=-5, s=6, right-moving.\n\nSpan at t: [ -5 + 6t, 6 + 6t ]\n\n0 in span if -5 + 6t ≤ 0 ≤ 6 + 6t\n\nWhich is -5 + 6t ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 6 + 6t\n\n0 ≤ 6 + 6t is always true for t ≥ 0 since 6+6t ≥6>0.\n\n-5 + 6t ≤ 0 implies 6t ≤ 5, t ≤ 5/6 ≈ 0.833\n\nSo for t ≤ 0.833, 0 is covered.\n\nt is integer since turns are discrete, I assume.\n\nTurns are discrete, so t = 0,1,2,... \n\nAt t=0: -5 +0 = -5 ≤0, 6+0=6≥0, so 0 in [-5,6], yes covered.\n\nt=1: -5+6=1, 6+6=12, [1,12], 1>0, so 0 not in [1,12], not covered.\n\nt=0: covered, t=1: not covered, and for t>1, min x increases, so never covered again.\n\nt=0: T=9, span [ -5 +6*0, 6+6*0] = [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nt=1: T=10, span [-5+6,6+6]=[1,12], 0 not <=1? 0<1, so not in [1,12].\n\nSimilarly, t=2: [7,18], etc.\n\nSo for freeway 2, at T=9 (t=0), covered; for T>9, not covered.\n\nSpecifically, only at T=9, covered if player is on row 2.\n\nBut player starts on row 1 at T=9, not on row 2.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (6,-5,right,6), so identical to freeway 2.\n\nAt T=9, covered, T>=10 not covered.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same, (6,-5,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: same\n\nFreeway 6: same\n\nAll freeways 2 to 6 have the same car configuration: one car (6,-5,right,6), so each has the same behavior: covered only at T=9.\n\nBut at T=9, player is on row 1, so for rows 2-6, if player is there at T=9, it would be collision, but player is not there at T=9.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (6,-5,right,6) same as above, so covered at T=9, not after.\n\nSecond car: (42,31,right,6) head=42, tail=31, s=6\n\nSpan at t: [31 + 6t, 42 + 6t]\n\n0 in span: 31+6t ≤0 ≤42+6t? But 31+6t >=31>0 for t>=0, so min x >0, never covered.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (-36,-47,right,6) head=-36? Tail=-47, s=6\n\nSpan at t: [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-47 + 6t, -36 + 6t]\n\n0 in span if -47 +6t ≤0 ≤ -36 +6t\n\nWhich requires -47+6t ≤0 and 0 ≤ -36 +6t\n\n-47+6t ≤0 => t ≤ 47/6 ≈7.833\n\n0 ≤ -36 +6t => 6t ≥36 => t ≥6\n\nSo for t from 6 to 7.833, so at integer t, t=6 and t=7.\n\nt=6: -47+36= -11, -36+36=0, so span [-11,0], 0 is included since ≤ and ≥, so 0 in [-11,0].\n\nt=7: -47+42= -5, -36+42=6, span [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nt=8: -47+48=1, -36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, t<6 or t>7 not covered.\n\nNow for freeway 7, we have three cars:\n\n- Car1: (6,-5,right,6): covered only at t=0 (T=9)\n\n- Car2: (42,31,right,6): never covered\n\n- Car3: (-36,-47,right,6): covered at t=6 and t=7 (T=15 and T=16)\n\nFreeway 8 has the same three cars, so identical.\n\nNow, summarize for each row, the times when it is unsafe (x=0 covered by some car):\n\n- Row 1: always safe (no car covers x=0)\n\n- Row 2: unsafe only at T=9\n\n- Row 3: same as row 2, unsafe only at T=9\n\n- Row 4: unsafe only at T=9\n\n- Row 5: unsafe only at T=9\n\n- Row 6: unsafe only at T=9\n\n- Row 7: unsafe at T=9 (from first car), and also at T=15 and T=16 (from third car)\n\n- Row 8: unsafe at T=9, T=15, T=16\n\nFor row 7: at T=9, unsafe because of car1; at T=15 and 16, unsafe because of car3.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn 9, position y=1.\n\nAt turn 9, y=1, which is safe, as row 1 always safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H: since we need to go from y=1 to y=9, that's 8 steps up, but we might need to wait or detour if there are obstacles.\n\nBut rows 2-6 are only unsafe at T=9, which is now past? At turn 9, player is on row 1, so for row 2, it is unsafe at T=9, but player is not on row 2 at T=9.\n\nNow, for future turns, row 2 is safe for T>=10.\n\nSimilarly rows 3-6 safe for T>=10.\n\nRow 7 unsafe at T=9, T=15, T=16\n\nRow 8 unsafe at T=9, T=15, T=16\n\nBut T=9 is current turn, player on row 1.\n\nPlayer actions: at each turn, choose U, D, or S to change y.\n\ny must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nWe want to minimize H, the number of turns to reach y=9.\n\nSince we can only move one step at a time, the minimal H is at least 8, if we go up every turn.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nAt turn 9: y=1, safe.\n\nWe choose action a_9, which determines y_{10}.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 10, choose a_{10}, determines y_{11}, and so on.\n\nThe position y_t is for turn t.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nFor collision at turn t: if on freeway y_t, and 0 covered by car on row y_t at time t.\n\nSo for each turn, when we are on a row between 1 and 8, we need to ensure it is safe at that time.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe times for each row:\n\n- Row 1: never unsafe\n\n- Row 2: unsafe only at t=9\n\n- Row 3: unsafe only at t=9\n\n- Row 4: unsafe only at t=9\n\n- Row 5: unsafe only at t=9\n\n- Row 6: unsafe only at t=9\n\n- Row 7: unsafe at t=9, t=15, t=16\n\n- Row 8: unsafe at t=9, t=15, t=16\n\nSince t=9 is the starting turn, and player is on row 1 at t=9, which is safe.\n\nFor rows 2-6, they are only unsafe at t=9, which has passed, so for t>=10, all rows 2-6 are always safe, because no other unsafe times.\n\nFor row 7 and 8, they are unsafe at t=15 and t=16.\n\nt=15 and t=16 are future turns.\n\nt here is absolute turn number.\n\nt_1=9, so t=15 is turn 15, which is 6 turns after turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, t=16 is 7 turns after.\n\nPlayer starts at turn 9, y=1.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nMinimal path: go up directly, but need to avoid row 7 and 8 at t=15 and 16 if possible.\n\nBut we might not reach that fast.\n\nFirst, let's see what the fastest way is.\n\nTurn 9: y=1, choose a_9.\n\nIf we choose U, then y_{10} = 1 +1 =2\n\nAt turn 10, y=2, which is row 2, and row 2 is safe for t>=10, since only unsafe at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, we can keep going up.\n\nBut row 7 and 8 have unsafe times at t=15 and 16.\n\nNow, let's see how many turns to reach y=9.\n\nStart turn 9, y=1\n\nTurn 10: if U, y=2\n\nTurn 11: U, y=3\n\nTurn 12: U, y=4\n\nTurn 13: U, y=5\n\nTurn 14: U, y=6\n\nTurn 15: U, y=7\n\nTurn 16: U, y=8\n\nTurn 17: U, y=9\n\nNow, at turn 15, y=7, which is row 7, and row 7 is unsafe at t=15, so collision if we are on row 7 at turn 15.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 16, if y=8, row 8 unsafe at t=16.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 15, y=7, unsafe; turn 16, y=8, unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot go directly up without waiting or something.\n\nWe need to avoid being on row 7 at turn 15, or row 8 at turn 16, etc.\n\nSince row 7 is also unsafe at turn 16? Row 7 unsafe at t=15 and t=16.\n\nSimilarly row 8 at t=15 and t=16.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=15, y=7, unsafe; t=16, y=8, unsafe.\n\nBut row 7 unsafe at both t=15 and 16, so if we are on row 7 at either turn, collision.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nWe could delay or advance the time we are on row 7 and 8.\n\nFor example, if we can be on row 7 before t=15 or after t=16.\n\nt=15 and 16 are specific times.\n\nWe could go slower or faster.\n\nGo faster: start from y=1 at t=9.\n\nIf we go up every turn:\n\nt=9: y=1\n\na9=U → y10=2\n\na10=U → y11=3\n\na11=U → y12=4\n\na12=U → y13=5\n\na13=U → y14=6\n\na14=U → y15=7 → but row 7 unsafe at t=15, collision\n\nIf we stay at some point to delay.\n\nGo slower: for example, stay at y=1 for one turn.\n\nt=9: y=1, choose S? Then y10=1\n\nThen a10=U → y11=2\n\na11=U → y12=3\n\na12=U → y13=4\n\na13=U → y14=5\n\na14=U → y15=6\n\na15=U → y16=7 → at t=16, y=7, row 7 unsafe at t=16, collision.\n\na16=U → y17=8 → at t=17, y=8, row 8 unsafe? Row 8 unsafe at t=15 and 16, t=17 is later, so for t=17, row 8 is safe? Let's see.\n\nRow 8 unsafe at t=15 and 16 only, as per earlier.\n\nt=17, which is after, should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 unsafe only at t=15,16.\n\nIn this sequence: t=16: y=7, row 7 unsafe at t=16, collision.\n\nWe need to avoid being on row 7 or 8 at t=15 or 16.\n\nPerhaps go faster in the beginning.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=9, if we could go up faster, but we can only move one step per turn, so we need at least 7 moves to go from y=1 to y=8, then to y=9.\n\ny=1 to y=8 is 7 steps, then to y=9 is another.\n\nBut y=9 is safe.\n\nThe critical part is to not be on row 7 or 8 at t=15 or 16.\n\nt=15 is 6 turns after t=9, t=16 is 7 turns after.\n\nWe need to schedule so that when we are on row 7, it is not t=15 or 16, similarly for row 8.\n\nSince rows 2-6 are always safe for t>=10, we can move freely on them.\n\nRow 1 is always safe.\n\nThe only constraints are on row 7 and 8 at times t=15 and 16.\n\nTo reach y=9, we must pass through row 7 and 8 at some points.\n\nLet t7 be the turn when we are on row 7, similarly t8 for row 8.\n\nThen we need t7 not in {15,16} and t8 not in {15,16}.\n\nAlso, since we move sequentially, |t8 - t7| <=1, because we move to adjacent rows.\n\nIf we go directly, t8 = t7 +1 if we move up.\n\nBut we could stay or move down, but to minimize time, probably move up directly except for waiting.\n\nNow, the time to reach y=9: let T_arrive be the turn when we first reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at t=9, y=1.\n\nThe number of up moves needed is at least 8.\n\nEach down move or stay increases time without progress, so to minimize H, we should avoid down moves and minimize stay actions.\n\nH is the number of turns from start to when we reach, including the start? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is from t= t1 to t1+H-1, and y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nAt turn t1, we are at y=1, we take actions for t=t1, t1+1, ..., up to t1+H-1, and after H actions, we reach y=9 at turn t1+H-1? Let's clarify.\n\nStart: at turn t1=9, position y= y_{t1} =1.\n\nWe choose action a_{t1} for turn t1.\n\nThen y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\nSimilarly, at turn t, choose a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAfter choosing a_t for t from t1 to t1+H-1, we have y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nThe position after H actions is at turn t1+H.\n\nAt turn t1, we are before choosing action, position given.\n\nAfter H actions, we reach position at turn t1+H.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nFor example, if we do nothing, H=0, but y_{t1} =1 ≠9, so H at least 1.\n\nMinimal H: if we could go directly, but with 8 up moves, we need 8 actions to go from y=1 to y=9.\n\nStart y=1 at turn 9.\n\nAfter one up move: a9=U, then at turn 10, y=2.\n\nAfter two up moves: a9=U, a10=U, turn 11, y=3.\n\n...\n\nAfter k up moves, at turn 9+k, y=1+k.\n\nTo reach y=9, 1+k=9, k=8, so at turn 9+8=17, y=9.\n\nSo minimal possible H is 8, with y_t = 1 + (t-9) for t=9 to 16, y17=9? Let's see:\n\nTurn t, y_t:\n\nt=9: y=1\n\na9=U → t=10: y=2\n\na10=U → t=11: y=3\n\n...\n\na15=U → t=16: y=7? Start y9=1, after a9 U, y10=2; after a10 U, y11=3; a11 U, y12=4; a12 U, y13=5; a13 U, y14=6; a14 U, y15=7; a15 U, y16=8; a16 U, y17=9.\n\nSo at turn 16, y=8, turn 17, y=9.\n\nNow, collision check:\n\nAt turn t, for y_t between 1 and 8.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nt=9: y=1, row 1, safe\n\nt=10: y=2, row 2, safe for t>=10\n\nt=11: y=3, row 3, safe\n\nt=12: y=4, row 4, safe\n\nt=13: y=5, row 5, safe\n\nt=14: y=6, row 6, safe\n\nt=15: y=7, row 7, unsafe at t=15\n\nt=16: y=8, row 8, unsafe at t=16\n\nSo collision at t=15 and t=16.\n\nTo avoid, we need to not be on row 7 at t=15 or t=16, and not on row 8 at t=15 or t=16.\n\nSince row 7 and 8 are unsafe at both t=15 and 16, we must be on row 7 at some other time, similarly for row 8.\n\nThe safe times for row 7: all times except t=15 and 16, so t<=14 or t>=17.\n\nSimilarly for row 8: t<=14 or t>=17.\n\nNow, since we need to go through row 7 and 8, and they are close, we can either go early or late.\n\nGo early: be on row 7 before t=15, i.e., t<=14.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nBut row 8 must be after row 7 if we go up.\n\nLet's see the earliest we can be on row 7.\n\nStart t=9, y=1.\n\nWe can go up as fast as possible:\n\nt=9: y=1\n\na9=U → t=10: y=2\n\na10=U → t=11: y=3\n\na11=U → t=12: y=4\n\na12=U → t=13: y=5\n\na13=U → t=14: y=6\n\na14=U → t=15: y=7 → but t=15, unsafe\n\nTo be on row 7 at t<=14, we need to be at y=7 by t=14 or earlier.\n\nAt t=14, y=6 in the above.\n\nIf we go faster, but we can't, since from y=1 at t=9, to y=7, that takes 6 moves: from y=1 to y=7 is 6 steps up.\n\ny=1 to y=2,3,4,5,6,7: 6 moves.\n\nAfter 6 up moves, at turn 9+6=15, y=7.\n\nBut t=15 is unsafe.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=7 is turn 15, which is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 14, what y can we be?\n\nAt turn 14, after 5 moves from t=9.\n\nStart t=9: y=1\n\nAfter 0 moves: t=9, y=1\n\nAfter 1 move: t=10, y=2\n\nAfter 2 moves: t=11, y=3\n\nAfter 3 moves: t=12, y=4\n\nAfter 4 moves: t=13, y=5\n\nAfter 5 moves: t=14, y=6\n\nAfter 6 moves: t=15, y=7\n\nAfter 7 moves: t=16, y=8\n\nAfter 8 moves: t=17, y=9\n\nSo at turn 14, we can be at y=6 max.\n\nWe cannot be at y=7 before turn 15.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be at y=8 before turn 16.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be on row 7 at t<=14, because the first possible time to be on row 7 is t=15.\n\nSimilarly, first possible for row 8 is t=16.\n\nBut at t=15, row 7 is unsafe; t=16, row 8 is unsafe.\n\nMoreover, if we are on row 7 at t=15, and move to row 8 at t=16, both unsafe.\n\nBut we could be on row 7 later, after t=16.\n\nFor example, at t=17 or later.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nBut to be on row 7 later, we need to delay reaching it.\n\nThat means we need to spend more time on lower rows.\n\nSince rows 1-6 are safe for all t>=10 (except row 1 always safe), we can stay or move down to kill time.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nSo let's find a way to be on row 7 at t>=17, and row 8 at t>=17 or something.\n\nt>=17 for row 7.\n\nSimilarly for row 8, t>=17 safe.\n\nNow, if we are on row 7 at t=17, then we can move to row 8 at t=18, then to row 9 at t=19.\n\nBut this takes more turns.\n\nMinimal H would be larger.\n\nWe could be on row 7 and row 8 at different times.\n\nFor example, be on row 7 at t=14? But we cannot, as above.\n\nt=14: max y=6.\n\nWe can be at y=7 only from t=15 onwards.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 from t=16 onwards.\n\nBut at t=15, y=7 unsafe; t=16, y=8 unsafe.\n\nSo we must not be on row 7 at t=15 or 16, so we must be on row 7 at t>=17.\n\nSimilarly for row 8, must be on row 8 at t>=17 or t<=14, but t<=14 not possible for row 8, so must be at t>=17.\n\nSo both row 7 and row 8 must be visited at t>=17.\n\nSince we move sequentially, we need to reach row 7 at some t>=17.\n\nThen row 8 at t+1 or later, then row 9.\n\nNow, from start, we need to delay until at least turn 17 to be on row 7.\n\nAt turn 17, we can be on row 7.\n\nHow to get there with minimal delay.\n\nStart at t=9, y=1.\n\nWe can spend time on lower rows.\n\nFor example, we can stay at y=1 for some turns, or move down to y=0, but y=0 is safe, but moving down might not help, since we need to go up eventually.\n\nTo minimize time, we should not move down, only stay or move up.\n\nSince we need to be at row 7 at t>=17, the earliest is t=17.\n\nAt t=17, we can be at y=7.\n\nFrom start, to be at y=7 at t=17.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=9 to y=7 at t=17, that takes 6 moves up, but from t=9 to t=17 is 8 turns (t=9 to 16 inclusive? Turns: t=9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16: 8 actions? Let's count the turns.\n\nFrom turn t to turn t+k, there are k actions to go from y to y+k, but with positions.\n\nAt turn 9: position y=1\n\nAfter actions a9 to a_{16}, we have y_{17}.\n\nTo have y_{17} =7, for example.\n\nBut we want to be at row 7 at turn t, so for turn 17, y_{17}=7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, the number of actions from turn 9 to turn 16 is 8 actions (a9 to a16), and y_{17} = y9 + sum of Δy from t=9 to 16.\n\ny9=1.\n\ny17 = y9 + Δy9 + Δy10 + ... + Δy16\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1.\n\ny17 = 1 + sum_{t=9 to 16} Δy_t\n\nWe want y17=7, so 1 + sum =7, so sum Δy from t=9 to 16 =6.\n\nThat means net +6 over 8 actions.\n\nSince each action changes y by at most 1, the minimal number of actions to increase y by 6 is 6, but here we have 8 actions, so we can have 6 up moves and 2 stay or 2 down, but down would decrease, so better to have stays.\n\nTo reach y=7 at turn 17, we need to have increased by 6 from y=1 at turn 9.\n\nWith 8 actions, we can have 6 U and 2 S, for example.\n\nSimilarly, if we want to reach earlier, but we can't reach y=7 before t=15.\n\nAt turn 17, y=7 is possible.\n\nThen from there, we can go to y=8 at turn 18, then y=9 at turn 19.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9, not necessarily at turn 17.\n\ny=9 at some turn.\n\nBut with this, at turn 19, y=9.\n\nNow, check if we can avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, get to row 7 at t=17.\n\nt=17 >=17, safe for row 7.\n\nThen at turn 17, y=7, safe.\n\nThen we can move up to y=8 at turn 18.\n\nAt turn 18, y=8, row 8.\n\nNow, row 8 is unsafe only at t=15 and 16, t=18>16, so safe.\n\nThen at turn 18, y=8, safe.\n\nThen move up to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nNow, we need to fill in the actions from t=9 to t=16 to have y_{17}=7.\n\ny_{17}=7 means that after a16, y17=7.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 17, position y=7.\n\nWe need to ensure that during turns 10 to 16, when we are on other rows, no collision.\n\nBut rows 1-6 are safe for all t>=10, as established.\n\nAt turn 9, we are on row 1, safe.\n\nNow, to have y_{17}=7.\n\ny9=1\n\ny17 = y9 + Δy9 + Δy10 + ... + Δy16\n\nSet of 8 actions: a9 to a16.\n\ny17 = 1 + sum_{t=9 to 16} Δy_t = 7, so sum Δy_t from t=9 to 16 = 6.\n\nEach Δy_t: U: +1, D: -1, S: 0.\n\nSo we need the net sum to be +6 over 8 actions.\n\nThus, number of U minus number of D must be 6.\n\nNumber of U + number of D + number of S = 8\n\nU - D = 6\n\nThen 2U + S = 8 + 6? Let's solve.\n\nSet U = number of U actions\n\nD = number of D actions\n\nS = number of S actions\n\nU + D + S = 8\n\nU - D = 6\n\nAdd: 2U + S = 14\n\nSubtract: 2D + S = 2? U - D =6, U + D + S =8\n\nThen (U + D + S) + (U - D) = 8 + 6 => 2U + S =14\n\n(U + D + S) - (U - D) = 8 - 6 => 2D + S =2\n\nSince S >=0, D >=0, from 2D + S =2, possible (D=0, S=2) or (D=1, S=0)\n\nIf D=1, S=0, then U - D = U -1 =6, so U=7\n\nThen U + D + S =7+1+0=8, yes.\n\nIf D=0, S=2, U=6, then U - D=6, U+D+S=6+0+2=8.\n\nNow, with D=1, we have a down move, which might not be efficient, but it could be used to adjust position.\n\nBut since we want minimal H, and we have to take 8 actions to reach turn 17, but H is the number of actions until we reach y=9.\n\nIn this case, with y17=7, then we need two more actions: a17=U to y18=8, a18=U to y19=9.\n\nSo at turn 19, y=9.\n\nH would be 10 actions? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from t1=9 to t1+H-1, and y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nt1=9.\n\ny_{9+H} =9.\n\nAt turn 9, y=1.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{9+H} =9.\n\nWith H actions, we can increase y by at most H, so min H=8.\n\nBut with constraints, it might be more.\n\nIn the delayed plan: we take actions from t=9 to t=18? Let's define.\n\nTo have y_{17}=7, we need actions a9 to a16, that's 8 actions.\n\nThen a17=U, y18=8\n\na18=U, y19=9\n\nSo we have actions from t=9 to t=18, that's 10 actions: a9 to a18.\n\nThen y_{19}=9.\n\nt1+H =19, so 9+H=19, H=10.\n\nThe sequence is from t=9 to t=9+H-1, so for H=10, actions at t=9 to t=18, and y_{19}=9.\n\nBut we can reach earlier if possible.\n\nWithout delay, we could reach at t=17 with y=9, but that requires being on row 7 at t=15 or earlier, which is impossible, or at t=16, but row 7 unsafe at t=16.\n\nAnother idea: be on row 7 at t=17, but reach row 8 earlier? No, row 8 must be after row 7.\n\nPerhaps skip row 7 or something, but we have to pass through each row.\n\nWe could go to row 7 after t=16.\n\nBut minimal time to row 7 is t=15, which is unsafe.\n\nSo we must go later.\n\nWith U=6, S=2, or U=7,D=1,S=0.\n\nTo minimize time, we should do the up moves as early as possible, but we need to delay being at row 7.\n\nSince rows 1-6 are safe, we can stay on them to delay.\n\nFor example, we can go up to y=6 quickly, then stay there until it is safe to go to row 7.\n\nRow 7 safe after t=16.\n\nSo we can be at y=6 at some point, then stay until turn 16 or later, then go to y=7 at turn >=17.\n\nFirst, go to y=6 as fast as possible.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=9:\n\na9=U → t=10: y=2\n\na10=U → t=11: y=3\n\na11=U → t=12: y=4\n\na12=U → t=13: y=5\n\na13=U → t=14: y=6\n\nSo at turn 14, y=6.\n\nNow, row 6 is safe for all t, since only unsafe at t=9, but t=14>9.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=7, but if we go at turn 14, a14=U → t=15: y=7, unsafe.\n\nSo we should not go to y=7 at t=15.\n\nWe can stay at y=6 for some turns.\n\nAt turn 14, y=6.\n\nWe choose a14: if S, then y15=6\n\nThen at turn 15, y=6, safe.\n\nThen we can choose a15: if S, y16=6\n\nThen a16: U, y17=7\n\nThen at turn 17, y=7, safe.\n\nThen a17=U, y18=8, safe (t=18>16)\n\na18=U, y19=9\n\nNow, actions: from t=9 to t=18: a9 to a18.\n\na9: U\n\na10: U\n\na11: U\n\na12: U\n\na13: U\n\na14: S  // stay at y=6\n\na15: S  // stay at y=6\n\na16: U  // to y=7 at t=17\n\na17: U  // to y=8 at t=18\n\na18: U  // to y=9 at t=19\n\nBut a18 is the action at turn 18, which sets y19=9.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions is for turns t=9 to t=18, 10 actions.\n\nH=10.\n\nWe could have only one stay to reduce H, but let's see.\n\nIf we have only one stay, for example.\n\nGo to y=6 at t=14.\n\nThen a14=S → t=15: y=6\n\nThen a15=U → t=16: y=7 → but row 7 unsafe at t=16\n\nCollision at t=16.\n\nIf we go to y=7 later.\n\na14=S → t=15: y=6\n\na15=S → t=16: y=6\n\na16=U → t=17: y=7 safe\n\nThen a17=U → t=18: y=8 safe\n\na18=U → t=19: y=9\n\nBut we have two stays.\n\nTo reach faster, we could go to a higher y earlier, but we cannot.\n\nAnother idea: since row 7 and 8 are only unsafe at t=15,16, and we must be on them at other times.\n\nBut for row 7, safe times t<=14 or t>=17, but t<=14 not possible, so only t>=17.\n\nSimilarly row 8 only t>=17.\n\nSo we must be on row 7 at t>=17, row 8 at t>=17 or later.\n\nThe minimal turn to reach y=9: to be at y=9, we need to have been at y=8 at previous turn, etc.\n\nEarliest y=8 at t=16, but row 8 unsafe at t=16.\n\nSo we must reach y=8 at t>=17.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at t>=17.\n\nThus, the earliest possible to reach y=9 is at turn 19, with y=9.\n\nAs above: at turn 19, y=9.\n\nWith H=10 actions from t=9 to t=18.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have two stays at y=6.\n\nWe could stay at other rows.\n\nFor example, we could go slower to y=6.\n\nBut to minimize time, we should go to y=6 as fast as possible, then wait.\n\nIn this case, with two stays.\n\nIf we have a down move, we could reduce the number of actions? No, down move would require more up moves later.\n\nFor example, with U=7, D=1, S=0.\n\nBut U=7, D=1, net U=6, so y can be reached with net +6, but with down, we might be at lower y at some point.\n\nBut for time, to reach y=7 at t=17, with 8 actions, U=7,D=1,S=0: U-D=6, yes.\n\nBut with down, we might have collision or not, but rows 1-6 safe, so no problem.\n\nBut we need to be at y=7 at turn 17.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to y=4 or something, then down, then up, but that might not save time.\n\nSince we need to delay, staying is better than moving down, because moving down might not delay the time to reach high y.\n\nIn this case, with U=7,D=1,S=0, we can reach y=7 at t=17, but we might reach earlier rows faster, but since we need to be at row 7 only at t>=17, it might be ok, but we have to ensure not to be on row 7 before.\n\nFor example, start: t=9, y=1\n\nSuppose a9=U → t=10: y=2\n\na10=U → t=11: y=3\n\na11=U → t=12: y=4\n\na12=U → t=13: y=5\n\na13=U → t=14: y=6\n\nNow, if we do a14=D, → t=15: y=5\n\na15=U → t=16: y=6\n\na16=U → t=17: y=7\n\nThen y17=7.\n\nBut at t=17, y=7, safe.\n\nThen a17=U → y18=8\n\na18=U → y19=9\n\nBut we used a down move, and still 10 actions to y=9 at t=19.\n\nNo gain.\n\nWith only one stay, but we need two extra actions to delay.\n\nIn the first plan with two stays, H=10.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision points.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 9: y=1, row 1, safe\n\nAction a9=U\n\nTurn 10: y=2, row 2, safe (t=10>9)\n\nAction a10=U\n\nTurn 11: y=3, row 3, safe\n\nAction a11=U\n\nTurn 12: y=4, row 4, safe\n\nAction a12=U\n\nTurn 13: y=5, row 5, safe\n\nAction a13=U\n\nTurn 14: y=6, row 6, safe\n\nAction a14=S  // stay, so y15=6\n\nTurn 15: y=6, row 6, safe\n\nAction a15=S  // stay, y16=6\n\nTurn 16: y=6, row 6, safe\n\nAction a16=U  // to y=7 at t=17\n\nTurn 17: y=7, row 7, t=17>=17, safe\n\nAction a17=U  // to y=8 at t=18\n\nTurn 18: y=8, row 8, t=18>16, safe\n\nAction a18=U  // to y=9 at t=19\n\nTurn 19: y=9, reached.\n\nNow, we have actions from t=9 to t=18, that's 10 actions.\n\nThe sequence should be written for turns starting from t1=9.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nSo for this: Turn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAnd after a18, y19=9, so we reached at turn 19.\n\nH=10 turns? The number of actions is 10, from t=9 to t=18.\n\nBut in terms of H, y_{t1 + H} =9, t1=9, so 9 + H =19, H=10.\n\nWe could have only one stay if we start later, but we start at t=9.\n\nAnother possibility: we could go to y=6 and stay only one turn, but as before, if we go to y=7 at t=16, unsafe.\n\nUnless we can be on row 7 at t=17 directly.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at t=17, we need to have y=6 at t=16 or y=7 at t=16 with stay, but if y=7 at t=16, unsafe.\n\ny=7 at t=16 is row 7 at t=16, unsafe.\n\nSo we must have y=6 at t=16, then move to y=7 at t=17.\n\nThus, we need to be at y=6 at turn 16.\n\nThen a16=U, y17=7.\n\nHow to be at y=6 at turn 16.\n\nFrom start, at turn 9, y=1.\n\nWe need to reach y=6 at turn 16.\n\nThat is, after 7 actions? From turn 9 to turn 15, actions a9 to a15 determine y16.\n\ny16 = y9 + Δy9 + ... + Δy15\n\ny9=1, y16=6, so 1 + sum_{t=9 to 15} Δy_t =6, so sum_{t=9 to 15} Δy_t =5\n\nNumber of actions: from t=9 to 15, 7 actions (t=9,10,11,12,13,14,15).\n\nActions a9 to a15, 7 actions.\n\ny16 = y9 + Δy9 + Δy10 + ... + Δy15\n\nΔy9 to Δy15: 7 terms.\n\ny16 =1 + sum_{i=0}^6 Δy_{9+i} =6, so sum =5.\n\nThus U - D =5, with 7 actions.\n\nU + D + S =7\n\nU - D =5\n\nAdd: 2U + S =12\n\nSubtract: 2D + S =2\n\nSo possible: D=0, S=2, U=5? 2U + S =12, U - D =5.\n\nIf D=0, U -0=5, U=5, then 2(5) + S=10+S=12, S=2.\n\nIf D=1, U-1=5, U=6, then 2(6) + S=12+S=12? 2U+S=12, U=6, 12+S=12, S=0.\n\nThen U=6,D=1,S=0.\n\nNow, with U=5,S=2,D=0: net +5, so y16=1+5=6.\n\nWith U=6,D=1,S=0: net U-D=5, y16=6.\n\nThen at turn 16, y=6.\n\nThen we need to go to y=7.\n\na16=U → y17=7\n\nThen a17=U → y18=8\n\na18=U → y19=9\n\nBut now, to reach y=6 at turn 16, we used 7 actions, but we still need a16 to a18 to reach y=9 at t=19, so actions from t=9 to t=18, same 10 actions.\n\nWith U=5,S=2 for the first 7 actions.\n\nFor example: go up slowly.\n\na9=U → y10=2\n\na10=U → y11=3\n\na11=U → y12=4\n\na12=S → y13=4? Let's see.\n\nTo have sum Δy =5 with 7 actions, U=5,S=2.\n\nSo we can have, for example:\n\na9=U → y10=2\n\na10=S → y11=2\n\na11=U → y12=3\n\na12=U → y13=4\n\na13=S → y14=4\n\na14=U → y15=5? y14=4, a14=U → y15=5\n\nThen a15=U → y16=6\n\ny15=5, a15=U → y16=6.\n\nThen at turn 16, y=6.\n\nThen a16=U → y17=7\n\na17=U → y18=8\n\na18=U → y19=9\n\nBut in this case, at turn 15, y=5, which is fine, but we reached y=6 at turn 16 instead of turn 14, so we delayed more, but still reach y=9 at turn 19.\n\nBut with more moves? No, same number of actions: 10 actions to turn 18.\n\nBut in the first plan, we had y=6 at turn 14, stayed two turns, then to y=7 at 17.\n\nIn this, we have y=6 later, but same end.\n\nBut with the first plan, we have fewer up moves? In first plan: U at t9,10,11,12,13,16,17,18: that's 7 U and 2 S? t9 to13: 5 U, t14 S, t15 S, t16 U, t17 U, t18 U, so U: t9,10,11,12,13,16,17,18: 8 U? But y from 1 to 9, need 8 up moves, yes.\n\nIn the sequence: start y9=1\n\na9=U: y10=2\n\na10=U: y11=3\n\na11=U: y12=4\n\na12=U: y13=5\n\na13=U: y14=6\n\na14=S: y15=6\n\na15=S: y16=6\n\na16=U: y17=7\n\na17=U: y18=8\n\na18=U: y19=9\n\nActions: U,U,U,U,U,S,S,U,U,U\n\nThat's 8 U and 2 S, net +8, y from 1 to 9, yes.\n\nIn the other sequence with late arrival at y=6: a9=U, a10=S, a11=U, a12=U, a13=S, a14=U, a15=U, then y16=6, then a16=U, y17=7, etc., same.\n\nBut minimal H is 10, with y=9 at turn 19.\n\nBut is there a way with H=9?\n\nH=9 actions: from t=9 to t=17, actions a9 to a17, then y_{18} =9.\n\ny_{18} = y9 + sum_{t=9 to 17} Δy_t =1 + sum =9, so sum Δy_t =8.\n\nThus, with 9 actions, net +8, so must be 8 U and 1 S, or 9 U, etc., no down.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at turn 18.\n\nNow, when is y=8? At turn 17 or earlier.\n\nBut y=8 at some turn.\n\nIf we reach y=8 at turn 17, then a17=U, y18=9.\n\nAt turn 17, y=8, row 8.\n\nBut row 8 unsafe at t=15 and 16, t=17>16, safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 must be visited at some point.\n\nSuppose we are on row 7 at turn t7.\n\nt7 must not be 15 or 16.\n\nBut to reach y=8 at turn 17, we must have been at y=7 at turn 16 or 17.\n\nIf at turn 16, y=7, but row 7 unsafe at t=16.\n\nIf at turn 17, y=7, then move to y=8 at turn 18, but we are considering reaching y=8 at turn 17 for H=9.\n\ny_{18}=9, so at turn 18, y=9.\n\nAt turn 17, y must be 8, because if y=7, then a17=U, y18=8, not 9; if y=8, a17=U, y18=9.\n\nSo to have y18=9, at turn 17, y must be 8.\n\nThen at turn 17, y=8, row 8, safe since t=17>16.\n\nNow, how did we get to y=8 at turn 17.\n\ny=8 at turn 17.\n\nFrom start, at turn 9, y=1.\n\nAfter 8 actions (a9 to a16), we have y17.\n\ny17 = y9 + Δy9 + ... + Δy16\n\ny9=1, y17=8, so 1 + sum_{t=9 to 16} Δy_t =8, so sum =7.\n\n8 actions, net +7.\n\nThus U - D =7, U + D + S=8.\n\nThen 2U + S =15? U - D=7, U+D+S=8.\n\nAdd: 2U + S =15\n\nSince S>=0, U <=7.5, but U integer, so U=7, S=1, D=0? 2U + S =14 + S? U=7, 2(7) + S=14+S=15, S=1.\n\nThen U=7, D=0, S=1.\n\nOr U=8, D=1, S= -1 impossible, so U=7, S=1, D=0.\n\nNow, y17=8.\n\nBut at turn 17, y=8, safe.\n\nBut we need to check how we got there, specifically at row 7.\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn 17, we must have been at y=7 at some point, but at which turn.\n\nFor example, if at turn 16, y=7, then a16=U, y17=8.\n\nBut at turn 16, y=7, row 7 unsafe at t=16, collision.\n\nIf at turn 17, we are at y=8 directly from y=7 at turn 16? But turn 16 position y=7, then a16=U, y17=8.\n\nBut y=7 at turn 16 is required.\n\nIs there a way to be at y=8 at turn 17 without being at row 7 at turn 16?\n\nNo, because to reach y=8 at turn 17, the previous position must be y=7 at turn 16, since we move step by step.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so if y_{17}=8, then y_{16} must be 7 or 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_{16}=7, then Δy_{16} could be U, to y17=8.\n\nIf y_{16}=8, then Δy_{16} could be S or D, but if S, y17=8, or D y17=7, not 8.\n\nBut we want y17=8, so if y16=8, then Δy16 must be S to stay at 8, but then y17=8, but we need to go to 9 later, but for now, if y16=8 and a16=S, y17=8, then we can go to 9 at turn 18, but that would be later.\n\nBut for H=9, we need y18=9, so if y17=8, then a17=U, y18=9.\n\nBut if at turn 17, y=8, which is fine.\n\nBut how did we get to y=8?\n\ny17=8.\n\ny17 could come from y16=7 with a16=U, or from y16=8 with a16=S, or y16=9 with a16=D, but not to 8.\n\nSo possible: y16=7 and a16=U, or y16=8 and a16=S.\n\nIf y16=8 and a16=S, y17=8, then at turn 16, y=8, row 8, but t=16, row 8 unsafe at t=16, collision.\n\nIf y16=7 and a16=U, y17=8, then at turn 16, y=7, row 7 unsafe at t=16, collision.\n\nTherefore, in both cases, to have y17=8, we must have a collision at turn 16: either on row 7 or row 8.\n\nSpecifically, if y16=7, collision; if y16=8, collision.\n\nThus, it is impossible to have y17=8 without collision at turn 16.\n\nTherefore, we cannot reach y=8 at turn 17 safely.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot reach y=9 before turn 19.\n\nThus, minimal H is 10.\n\nWith the sequence as before.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need the sequence of actions.\n\nIn the sequence I have:\n\nActions:\n\nAt turn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 19, y=9.\n\nBut the sequence is for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1, which is turn 9 to 18 for H=10.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 18, we do U, to reach y=9 at turn 19.\n\nWe could have different actions, but this should be fine.\n\nTo make it with only one stay, but we need two extra actions to delay.\n\nAnother way: we could go to y=5 or something and stay, but similar.\n\nI think H=10 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars, but we handled the unsafe times.\n\nIn freeway 7, we have car at t=15 and 16, etc., covered.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut at turn 18, action U, to go to y=9.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,1) at turn 9, and we have actions from turn 9 onwards.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 10 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can start with stay, but that would delay more.\n\nFor example, if we do S at turn 9, then y10=1, then we need more actions to catch up.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the above is better.\n\nThus, minimal H is 10.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Positions and Unsafe Times\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: The car (head=36, tail=25, direction=right, speed=12) never covers x=0 for \\(T \\geq 9\\), so row 1 is always safe.\n- **Freeways 2-6 (y=2 to y=6)**: Each has a car (head=6, tail=-5, direction=right, speed=6). These cars cover x=0 only at \\(T = 9\\). For \\(T \\geq 10\\), row 2 to row 6 are safe.\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Three cars:\n  - Car 1: (head=6, tail=-5, direction=right, speed=6) covers x=0 at \\(T = 9\\).\n  - Car 2: (head=42, tail=31, direction=right, speed=6) never covers x=0.\n  - Car 3: (head=-36, tail=-47, direction=right, speed=6) covers x=0 at \\(T = 15\\) and \\(T = 16\\).\n  Thus, row 7 is unsafe at \\(T = 9\\), \\(T = 15\\), and \\(T = 16\\).\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Same cars as freeway 7, so row 8 is unsafe at \\(T = 9\\), \\(T = 15\\), and \\(T = 16\\).\n\nSince the player starts at \\(y = 1\\) at \\(T = 9\\) (safe), and rows 2-6 are safe for \\(T \\geq 10\\), the only constraints are on rows 7 and 8 at \\(T = 15\\) and \\(T = 16\\). The player must avoid being on row 7 or row 8 at these times.\n\n### Minimal Path to Reach (0, 9)\n- The minimal number of turns to go from \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is 8 if moving directly up, but this would place the player on row 7 at \\(T = 15\\) and row 8 at \\(T = 16\\), both unsafe.\n- To avoid collisions, the player must delay reaching row 7 until \\(T \\geq 17\\) and row 8 until \\(T \\geq 17\\), as these are the only safe times after \\(T = 16\\).\n- The earliest possible time to be on row 7 is \\(T = 15\\), but this is unsafe. Thus, row 7 must be reached at \\(T = 17\\) or later.\n- Similarly, row 8 must be reached at \\(T = 17\\) or later.\n- The fastest way to reach \\(y = 9\\) safely is:\n  - Move up directly to row 6 by \\(T = 14\\) (safe, as rows 2-6 are safe for \\(T \\geq 10\\)).\n  - Stay on row 6 for turns \\(T = 14\\) and \\(T = 15\\) to avoid being on row 7 at \\(T = 15\\) or \\(T = 16\\).\n  - Move up to row 7 at \\(T = 17\\) (safe).\n  - Move up to row 8 at \\(T = 18\\) (safe).\n  - Move up to row 9 at \\(T = 19\\).\n\nThis path requires 10 turns (actions from turn 9 to turn 18), reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19. Attempts to reach \\(y = 9\\) in fewer turns (e.g., 9 turns) result in collision at \\(T = 16\\) when on row 7 or row 8.\n\n### Action Sequence\n- **Turn 9**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 10.\n- **Turn 10**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 11.\n- **Turn 11**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 12.\n- **Turn 12**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 13.\n- **Turn 13**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 14.\n- **Turn 14**: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 15.\n- **Turn 15**: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 16.\n- **Turn 16**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 17.\n- **Turn 17**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 18.\n- **Turn 18**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions:\n- At \\(T = 9\\): On row 1 (safe).\n- At \\(T = 10\\) to \\(T = 13\\): On rows 2 to 5 (safe for \\(T \\geq 10\\)).\n- At \\(T = 14\\) to \\(T = 16\\): On row 6 (safe for \\(T \\geq 10\\)).\n- At \\(T = 17\\): On row 7 (safe at \\(T \\geq 17\\)).\n- At \\(T = 18\\): On row 8 (safe at \\(T \\geq 17\\)).\n- At \\(T = 19\\): Reached \\(y = 9\\) (no freeway, safe).\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H = 10\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\end{array} }",

The current turn is t_1 = 10, and I'm at y=2.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. Cars move left or right with constant speed. For a car, at turn t, it has a head and tail. For left-moving cars, the span is [h, τ] and it moves left, so at time T, the span is [h - s(T-t), τ - s(T-t)]. For right-moving cars, it's [τ, h] and moves to [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)]. But in the table, for freeway 7 and 8, there are cars with head and tail given, and direction.\n\nLet me list all the cars clearly.\n\nFor each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, (head=48, tail=37, direction=right, speed=12). Since direction is right, head should be greater than tail? It says (48,37,right,12), so head=48, tail=37, so since right-moving, the span is from τ to h, so [37,48] at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, for others:\n\nFreeway 2: (12,1,right,6) so [1,12] at t=10\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (12,1,right,6) so [1,12]\n\nThe table says for freeway 3: (12,1,right,6) — is that one car or multiple? It seems like each entry is one car per freeway, but for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars listed.\n\nLook:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars (head, tail, direction, speed) |\n\nFor k=1: one car: (48,37,right,12)\n\nk=2: (12,1,right,6) — one car\n\nk=3: (12,1,right,6) — one car\n\nk=4: (12,1,right,6) — one car\n\nk=5: (12,1,right,6) — one car\n\nk=6: (12,1,right,6) — one car\n\nk=7: (12,1,right,6), (48,37,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6) — three cars\n\nk=8: (12,1,right,6), (48,37,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6) — three cars\n\nAll cars are right-moving, since direction is \"right\" for all.\n\nAnd for right-moving, the span at time t is [τ, h], and at time T, it's [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)].\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, the player is at y_T, and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe player position is (0, y_t), so x is always 0, we only care about y position at each turn.\n\nPlayer moves vertically: U, D, S to change y.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 from y=2 in min turns.\n\ny=9 is the top, and there are freeways from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nBut we need to be at (0,9), which is fine.\n\nNow, since we start at y=2 at t=10, and we need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns would be at least 7, since we need to go up 7 units, but we can go down or stay, so it might be more if we have to avoid cars.\n\nBut with U action, we can move up one per turn, so in 7 turns we could be at y=9 if no cars block.\n\nBut there are cars on each freeway, so we need to check when it's safe to be on each y from 1 to 8 at each turn.\n\nSince we move one y per turn or stay, we can only change y by -1,0,1 each turn.\n\nAlso, note that when we move to a new y, we are not on that y until the next turn.\n\nImportant point: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nSimilarly, when we are at y_T at turn T, we are on freeway y_T, and we collide if 0 in span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nIf we stay or move, at the beginning of turn T, we are at position (0, y_T), and we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nThen during the turn, cars move, and at the end of the turn, we are at y_{T+1}, and we check for collision at that position for turn T+1? I think I need to clarify the timing.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd turn T, player is at (0, y_T).\n\nNow, when do we check collision? At the start of the turn or end?\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nSo, at turn T, we are considered to be on y_T, not on y_{T+1}.\n\nThe collision is checked based on where we are at the start of the turn, I think.\n\nLet's see the player update: at turn t, position is (0, y_t), then we choose action a_t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nThen for collision at turn t: it depends on y_t and the car positions at turn t.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t+1, collision depends on y_{t+1} and car positions at turn t+1.\n\nThe note clarifies that when we move from y_t to y_{t+1} at turn t, during turn t, we are on y_t, so we only care about cars on y_t at time t for collision at turn t. When we arrive at y_{t+1} at the start of turn t+1, we care about cars on y_{t+1} at time t+1.\n\nSo for each turn, we are at y_t at the start, and collision is checked based on y_t and cars at time t.\n\nThen we take action, which moves us to y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, for turn T, we are at y_T, and if 0 is in the span for any car on freeway y_T at time T, collision.\n\nThen we take action a_T to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nCars update at each turn, so at time T, car positions are based on initial at t_1 and time elapsed.\n\nSince t_1=10 is the current time, for any future time T, car positions are computed from t=10.\n\nLet t_1 = 10.\n\nFor a future turn T ≥ 10, the car on freeway k at time T has span based on its state at t=10.\n\nFor a car given at t_1 with (h, τ, d, s), at time T, if d=right, span is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nIf d=left, [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]\n\nBut in this case, all cars are right-moving, so only right case.\n\nd=right for all cars.\n\nSo for any car, at time T, span = [τ + s(T-10), h + s(T-10)]\n\nThen collision on freeway k at time T if player is at y_T = k and 0 is in the span for that car.\n\nSince multiple cars, if any car on that freeway has 0 in span, collision.\n\nNow, freeway k from 1 to 8.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions from t=10 onwards, starting from y=2, to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12) so at time T, span = [37 + 12(T-10), 48 + 12(T-10)]\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (h=12, τ=1, d=right, s=6) span = [1 + 6(T-10), 12 + 6(T-10)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2: (12,1,right,6) so [1 + 6(T-10), 12 + 6(T-10)]\n\nFreeway 4: same, (12,1,right,6) [1+6(T-10),12+6(T-10)]\n\nFreeway 5: same\n\nFreeway 6: same\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars:\n\nCar1: (12,1,right,6) so [1 + 6(T-10), 12 + 6(T-10)]\n\nCar2: (48,37,right,6) so [37 + 6(T-10), 48 + 6(T-10)]\n\nCar3: (-30,-41,right,6) so [-41 + 6(T-10), -30 + 6(T-10)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same three cars as freeway 7.\n\nNow, for each freeway k and time T, we need to know if it is occupied at x=0, i.e., if 0 is in the span for any car on that freeway.\n\nSince all cars on a freeway, we need for each k, at each T, if there is a car with span containing 0.\n\nPlayer at y_T = k only if k between 1 and 8, and we need no car with 0 in span on that freeway at that time.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nNow, we start at t=10, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMin H such that after H turns, at turn t=10+H, we are at y=9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t_1 =10, we are at y_{10} =2.\n\nThen we take actions a_{10}, a_{11}, ..., up to a_{10+H-1}, and after H actions, at turn t=10+H, we are at y_{10+H}, and we want y_{10+H} =9.\n\nThe position after H turns: start at turn 10, after 0 actions, position y_{10}.\n\nAfter first action at turn 10, we go to y_{11} at turn 11.\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 10+H, position y_{10+H}.\n\nWe want y_{10+H} =9 for some H.\n\nAnd minimal H.\n\nSince we start at y=2, to reach y=9, we need at least 7 up moves, but we can have down or stay, so H could be more than 7.\n\nBut with only up moves, H=7 would get us to y=9 at turn 17.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions at turns when we are on y=1 to 8.\n\nAt turn 10, we are on y=2, so we need to check if y=2 is safe at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, each turn we are on some y.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway and time, when it is safe, i.e., no car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, span [37 + 12(T-10), 48 + 12(T-10)]\n\n0 in span if 37 + 12(T-10) ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 12(T-10)\n\nSince the span is increasing, we can solve for T.\n\nLet ΔT = T-10, so at time T=10+ΔT.\n\nSpan: [37 + 12ΔT, 48 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in [37+12ΔT, 48+12ΔT] iff 37+12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 48+12ΔT\n\nBut 37+12ΔT ≤ 0 implies 12ΔT ≤ -37, ΔT ≤ -37/12 ≈ -3.083, but ΔT ≥0 since T≥10, so 37+12ΔT ≥37 >0, so lower bound always positive, thus 0 < 37+12ΔT ≤ lower, so 0 never in the span because the span starts at 37+12ΔT ≥37>0 and increases, so 0 is always left of the span. Thus for freeway 1, at all times T≥10, 0 is not in the span, so freeway 1 is always safe.\n\nIs that right? 37 + 12ΔT, for ΔT=0, 37 to 48, both positive, so 0 not in [37,48]. As ΔT increases, it moves right, so always positive, so yes, freeway 1 is always safe to be on, since 0 never covered.\n\nBut we need to be on the freeway at that time, but since no car covers x=0, it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: car with span [1 + 6ΔT, 12 + 6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 1 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 12 + 6ΔT\n\nNow, 1 + 6ΔT ≤ 0: 6ΔT ≤ -1, ΔT ≤ -1/6, impossible for ΔT≥0.\n\n12 + 6ΔT ≥12>0, so 0 ≤ 12+6ΔT always true for ΔT≥0.\n\nBut 1 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 is false, so 0 not ≤ lower bound? 0 in [L,H] if L ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ H.\n\nL = 1 + 6ΔT ≥1 >0 for ΔT≥0, so L >0, so 0 < L ≤, so 0 not in [L,H] since L>0. Thus 0 never in the span for freeway 2. Similarly for freeways 3,4,5,6, all have the same car (12,1,right,6), so same as freeway 2, always safe.\n\nFreeway 3: same car, so yes.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nCar1: (12,1,right,6) so span [1 + 6ΔT, 12 + 6ΔT], same as above, always L>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nCar2: (48,37,right,6) span [37 + 6ΔT, 48 + 6ΔT], L=37+6ΔT≥37>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nCar3: (-30,-41,right,6) but head and tail, for right-moving, it's (head, tail) = (-30,-41), and since right, span is [τ, h] = [-41, -30] at ΔT=0? At t=10.\n\nThe car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed) = (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nFor right-moving, at time t, span is [tail, head] = [-41, -30] at t=10.\n\nThen at time T, span [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)] = [-41 + 6ΔT, -30 + 6ΔT]\n\nNow, 0 in span if -41 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -30 + 6ΔT\n\nThat is, L = -41 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ H = -30 + 6ΔT\n\nSo L ≤ 0: -41 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 => 6ΔT ≤ 41 => ΔT ≤ 41/6 ≈ 6.833\n\nAnd 0 ≤ H: 0 ≤ -30 + 6ΔT => 6ΔT ≥ 30 => ΔT ≥ 5\n\nSo for 5 ≤ ΔT ≤ 6.833, since ΔT integer, ΔT=5,6\n\nΔT=5: L = -41 + 30 = -11, H = -30 + 30 = 0\n\n0 ≤ H =0, which is true, and L ≤0: -11≤0 true, so 0 in span since [L,H] = [-11,0], 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=6: L = -41 + 36 = -5, H = -30 + 36 = 6, so [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nΔT=7: L = -41 + 42 =1, H= -30+42=12, [1,12], 0 not in, since L=1>0.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=4: L= -41+24= -17, H= -30+24= -6, [-17,-6], 0 not in, all negative.\n\nΔT=5: [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔT=6: [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔT=7: [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo for freeway 7, car3 has 0 in span at ΔT=5 and 6, i.e., T=15 and 16.\n\nBut there are other cars, but car1 and car2 never have 0 in span, as we saw, so only car3 matters.\n\nThus, on freeway 7, unsafe when car3 has 0 in span, at T=15 and 16.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 8, same three cars, so unsafe at T=15 and 16.\n\nNow, freeway 1 to 6 are always safe, as we saw.\n\nFreeway 1: always safe\n\nFreeway 2 to 6: always safe, since the car has min 1 at t=10, increasing.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: unsafe only at T=15 and T=16.\n\nT=15 and T=16.\n\nt_1=10, so T=15 is ΔT=5, T=16 is ΔT=6.\n\nNow, player starts at t=10, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince freeways 1-6 are always safe, we can be on them any time.\n\nFreeways 7 and 8 are unsafe at t=15 and 16, so we should not be on y=7 or y=8 at turns 15 or 16.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are the freeways.\n\nAt turn T, if y_T=7 or y_T=8, and T=15 or 16, collision.\n\nOther times, safe for all freeways.\n\nAlso, y=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nNow, we start at t=10, y=2.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal path might be to go up directly, but we need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at t=15 or 16.\n\nSince we can only move one step per turn, we need to plan the sequence.\n\nFirst, if we go up every turn, from y=2 at t=10.\n\nt=10: y=2\n\na=U: y=3 at t=11\n\na=U: y=4 at t=12\n\na=U: y=5 at t=13\n\na=U: y=6 at t=14\n\na=U: y=7 at t=15\n\nBut at t=15, y=7, which is freeway 7, and t=15 is unsafe, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=7 at t=15, collision.\n\nThen we cannot.\n\nWe could stay or go down to avoid.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nSince freeways 7 and 8 are only unsafe at t=15,16, we should not be on them at those times.\n\nWe can be on them at other times.\n\nFor example, at t=14, y=6, if we go up, we go to y=7 at t=15, but t=15 unsafe.\n\nSo we could stay at y=6 at t=15, or go down to y=5, but y=5 is safe, but then we need to go up later.\n\nSimilarly, at t=16, if we are on y=7 or 8, unsafe.\n\nBut t=16 might be different.\n\nFirst, let's list possible times to be at each y.\n\nSince we start from y=2 at t=10, and need to reach y=9.\n\nThe net displacement is +7, so we need at least 7 up moves.\n\nEach down move or stay adds extra turns.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to use as few extra moves as possible, so ideally no down or stay, only up.\n\nBut we have to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nThe unsafe situation is only at t=15 and 16 for y=7 and 8.\n\nSo we need to ensure that we are not on y=7 or 8 at t=15 or 16.\n\nAt other times, we can be on any y.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nSuppose we want to be at y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nEarliest possible: if no obstacles, from y=2 at t=10, after 7 up moves: at t=17, y=9.\n\nt=10: y=2\n\nt=11: y=3\n\nt=12: y=4\n\nt=13: y=5\n\nt=14: y=6\n\nt=15: y=7 → but unsafe if on y=7 at t=15\n\nt=16: y=8\n\nt=17: y=9\n\nBut at t=15, if we are on y=7, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at t=16, if on y=8, but in this sequence, at t=16 y=8, which is unsafe if t=16, since freeway 8 unsafe at t=16.\n\nt=16 is also unsafe for y=7 or 8.\n\nIn the sequence above, both t=15 and t=16 are problematic.\n\nAt t=15 y=7 unsafe, t=16 y=8 unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=7 at t=15 or y=8 at t=16 in this path.\n\nBut we need to adjust.\n\nOne way is to delay the ascent so that we are not on y=7 or 8 at t=15,16.\n\nFor example, stay at some point.\n\nSince we can be on y=7 or 8 at other times, like t=14 or t=17, etc.\n\nFor instance, at t=14, we could be at y=7, but t=14 is safe for all, since unsafe only at t=15,16.\n\nSimilarly, t=17 is safe.\n\nSo we can be on y=7 at t=14 or earlier or later except t=15,16.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 at minimal time.\n\nThe target is to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nWith all up, we can reach at t=17.\n\nBut at t=15 and t=16, we have issue.\n\nIn the direct path, at t=15 we need to not be at y=7.\n\nSimilarly at t=16 not at y=8.\n\nBut in the sequence, when we go from t=14 y=6 to t=15 y=7, we are forced to be at y=7 at t=15.\n\nTo avoid, we can at t=14, instead of going up to y=7 at t=15, we can stay at y=6 or go down to y=5.\n\nBut if we stay at t=14, at t=14 we are at y=6, take action S, so at t=15 y=6 still.\n\nThen at t=15, y=6, which is freeway 6, which is always safe, so no problem.\n\nThen at t=15, we can go up to y=7, but at t=15, if we go to y=7 at t=16? Let's see.\n\nAt t=15, we are at y=6, take action U, so y_{16} =7.\n\nThen at turn t=16, we are at y=7, and t=16 is unsafe for y=7, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we take action D, y_{16}=5, but then we go down, not good.\n\nOr S, stay at y=6.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nSince at t=15 and t=16, we should avoid y=7 and 8.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=7 before t=15 or after t=16.\n\nFor example, from start, go up faster or slower.\n\nStart at t=10 y=2.\n\nWe can go up to y=6 quickly, then stay or something.\n\nt=10: y=2, action U: to y=3 at t=11\n\nt=11: y=3, U to y=4 at t=12\n\nt=12: y=4, U to y=5 at t=13\n\nt=13: y=5, U to y=6 at t=14\n\nNow at t=14, y=6.\n\nIf we go U, to y=7 at t=15, unsafe.\n\nSo instead, at t=14, we can take S, so at t=15 y=6 (safe)\n\nThen at t=15, we are at y=6, we cannot go to y=7 because at t=16 if we go to y=7, but at t=16 we are at y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nAction at t=15: if we take U, y_{16}=7, then at t=16 y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf take D, y_{16}=5, then we go down.\n\nIf take S, y_{16}=6.\n\nThen at t=16, y=6, safe.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nThen at t=16, we can go U to y=7 at t=17.\n\nt=17: y=7, now t=17 is safe, since unsafe only at t=15,16.\n\nThen at t=17, U to y=8 at t=18\n\nt=18: y=8, U to y=9 at t=19\n\nBut at t=18, y=8, is it safe? t=18, ΔT=8, freeway 8: car3 span [-41 + 6*8, -30 + 6*8] = [-41+48, -30+48] = [7,18], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=17: ΔT=7, freeway 7: car3 [ -41 +42, -30+42] = [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nt=10: y=2\n\na=U: t=11 y=3\n\na=U: t=12 y=4\n\na=U: t=13 y=5\n\na=U: t=14 y=6\n\na=S: t=15 y=6  (stay)\n\na=U: t=16 y=7? At t=15, action U, so y_{16} = y_{15} +1 =6+1=7\n\nThen at t=16, y=7, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nAt t=15, we are at y=6.\n\nWe take action: if we take U, then y_{16} =7.\n\nThen at turn t=16, we are at position (0, y_{16}) = (0,7), and we check collision at turn t=16 for y=7.\n\nt=16 is unsafe for freeway 7, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we take S at t=15, y_{16}=6, then at t=16 y=6, safe.\n\nBut then at t=16, we take U, to y_{17}=7, then at t=17 y=7, which is safe.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=14: y=6, take action S, so at t=15, y=6 (since we stayed)\n\nThen at t=15, we are at y=6, take action U, so y_{16} =7, but y_{16} is position at turn t=16.\n\nAt turn t=15, we are at y=6, safe.\n\nWe take action U, which means we move to y=7 during the turn, so at the start of turn t=16, we are at y=7.\n\nThen at turn t=16, we are at y=7, and since t=16, freeway 7 is unsafe, collision.\n\nTo avoid, at t=15, we should not move to y=7 if t=16 is unsafe, but t=16 is unsafe for y=7.\n\nWe need to stay at y=6 or go down at t=15.\n\nBut if we stay at t=15: at t=15, take S, so y_{16}=6.\n\nThen at turn t=16, we are at y=6, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=16, we can take U, to y_{17}=7.\n\nThen at turn t=17, y=7, safe (since t=17 not 15 or 16).\n\nThen at t=17, take U to y_{18}=8.\n\nAt turn t=18, y=8, now t=18, freeway 8: car3 span [-41 +6*8, -30+48] = [-41+48, -30+48] = [7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at t=18, take U to y_{19}=9.\n\nAt turn t=19, y=9, reached.\n\nBut this took 9 turns from start? Let's count turns.\n\nStart at t=10, after 0 actions.\n\nAfter 1 action at t=10: to t=11 y=3? No.\n\nSequence of actions:\n\nAt turn t=10: we are at y=2, take action a_{10}, go to y_{11}\n\nSimilarly.\n\nList the turns and positions:\n\nTurn | position y_t | action a_t\n\nt=10: y=2, take a_{10}\n\nt=11: y_{11}, take a_{11}\n\netc.\n\nWe want y_{10+H} =9.\n\nIn the above:\n\nSuppose:\n\nAt t=10: y=2, take U → y_{11}=3\n\nt=11: y=3, take U → y_{12}=4\n\nt=12: y=4, take U → y_{13}=5\n\nt=13: y=5, take U → y_{14}=6\n\nt=14: y=6, take S → y_{15}=6  (since S, no change)\n\nt=15: y=6, take S → y_{16}=6  (stay again)\n\nt=16: y=6, take U → y_{17}=7\n\nt=17: y=7, take U → y_{18}=8\n\nt=18: y=8, take U → y_{19}=9\n\nAt t=19, y=9.\n\nBut we used two stay actions, so H=9 turns to reach at t=19.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nAfter t=14 y=6, we stayed at t=14 to avoid going to y=7 at t=15.\n\nBut at t=15, we could go down to y=5, but that might not help.\n\nSince freeways 1-6 are safe, we can be on them at t=15 and 16.\n\nBut we need to cross y=7 and 8 after t=16.\n\nt=16 is unsafe, t=17 is safe.\n\nSo the earliest we can be on y=7 is t=17.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at t=17 or later.\n\nNow, from start, at t=10 y=2, we need to get to y=6 or something by t=14, then wait until t=16 to move up.\n\nBut at t=14, we are at y=6.\n\nThen we need to not go to y=7 until t=17.\n\nSo from t=14 to t=16, we must stay at y=6 or below.\n\nBut y=6 is safe.\n\nSo at t=14: y=6, take S → t=15 y=6\n\nt=15: y=6, take S → t=16 y=6\n\nt=16: y=6, take U → t=17 y=7\n\nt=17: y=7, take U → t=18 y=8\n\nt=18: y=8, take U → t=19 y=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut at t=16, after we take U, we go to y=7 at t=17, but at t=17 it's safe.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we go up faster initially.\n\nFrom t=10 y=2, take U to y=3 at t=11\n\nBut we can only move one step per turn.\n\nMinimum time to reach y=9 is 7 up moves, so at least 7 actions, reaching at t=17.\n\nBut at t=17 y=9, we are at y=9, which is safe, but to be there at t=17, we need y_{17}=9.\n\nIn the direct path, we would be at y=7 at t=15 and y=8 at t=16, both unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, we need to not be at those positions at those times.\n\nOne way is to be at y=7 earlier or later.\n\nFor example, be at y=7 at t=14.\n\nt=14: y=7, is it safe? t=14, ΔT=4, freeway 7: car3 span [-41 +6*4, -30+24] = [-41+24, -30+24] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=13: ΔT=3, [-41+18, -30+18] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nt=12: [-41+12, -30+12] = [-29,-18], etc.\n\nAll safe except t=15 and 16.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSo at t=14, y=7 is safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go to y=8 at t=15, but t=15 y=8 is unsafe.\n\nt=15, if y=8, freeway 8 unsafe at t=15.\n\nSo we cannot go to y=8 at t=15.\n\nAfter y=7 at t=14, we could stay or go down.\n\nBut let's see a sequence.\n\nStart: t=10 y=2, U → t=11 y=3\n\nt=11 y=3, U → t=12 y=4\n\nt=12 y=4, U → t=13 y=5\n\nt=13 y=5, U → t=14 y=6\n\nBut we want to be at y=7 at t=14, so at t=13, we need to be at y=6? t=13 y=5, take U to y=6 at t=14? No.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=14, we need at t=13 to be at y=6 or 7 or 8, but from t=13 y=5, take U to y=6 at t=14, not y=7.\n\ny_t is position at start of turn t.\n\nAt t=13, y=5, take action: to be at y=7 at t=14, we need to move up twice in one turn? No, only one action per turn, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy = -1,0,1.\n\nSo to go from y_t to y_{t+1}, only change by at most 1.\n\nSo at t=13, if y=5, we can go to y=6 at t=14, not directly to y=7.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=14, we must have been at y=6 or y=7 or y=8 at t=13.\n\nBut at t=13, we are at y=5 from above sequence.\n\nFrom start:\n\nt=10 y=2, U → t=11 y=3\n\nt=11 y=3, U → t=12 y=4\n\nt=12 y=4, U → t=13 y=5\n\nNow at t=13 y=5, we can take U to go to y=6 at t=14.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=14, we need to have taken action at t=13 to go up from y=6, but at t=13 we are at y=5, so we go to y=6 at t=14.\n\nSo at t=14, y=6.\n\nThen to be at y=7, we need to take U at t=14, to go to y=7 at t=15, but t=15 unsafe.\n\nSo cannot be at y=7 at t=15.\n\nBut we can be at y=7 at t=14? How?\n\nAt t=13, if we are at y=6, then take U at t=13 to go to y=7 at t=14.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at t=13 we are at y=5, not y=6.\n\nSo we need to be at y=6 earlier.\n\nStart faster:\n\nt=10 y=2, take U → t=11 y=3\n\nt=11 y=3, take U → t=12 y=4\n\nt=12 y=4, take U → t=13 y=5\n\nTo be at y=6 at t=13, we need at t=12 to be at y=5 or 6.\n\nAt t=12 we are at y=4, so take U to y=5 at t=13.\n\nCannot be at y=6 at t=13 from here.\n\nEarliest to be at y=6 is t=14: from y=2 at t=10, after 4 up moves: t=14 y=6.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=7 at t=14, we need to be at y=6 at t=13.\n\nAt t=13 y=6, take U to y=7 at t=14.\n\nTo be at y=6 at t=13, we need to start with more up moves.\n\nt=10 y=2, U → t=11 y=3\n\nt=11 y=3, U → t=12 y=4\n\nBut at t=12 y=4, we need to be at y=6 at t=13? Impossible, since only one move.\n\nFrom t=10 to t=11: y=2 to y=3\n\nt=11 to t=12: y=3 to y=4\n\nt=12 to t=13: y=4 to y=5\n\nt=13 to t=14: y=5 to y=6\n\nSo y=6 at t=14.\n\nThen y=7 at earliest t=15.\n\nBut t=15 unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=7 before t=15, since it takes at least 5 moves to go from y=2 to y=7, so t=15 is the earliest possible for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at t=16 earliest.\n\nBut t=15 and t=16 are unsafe for y=7 and y=8 respectively.\n\nTherefore, we must delay being on y=7 and y=8 until after t=16.\n\nSo we can be on y=7 at t=17 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to go through y=7 and y=8 at some point.\n\nThe minimal time is to be at y=7 at t=17, y=8 at t=18, y=9 at t=19.\n\nBut we can be at y=8 at t=17? If we are at y=7 at t=16, but t=16 y=7 unsafe.\n\nCannot be at y=7 at t=16.\n\nEarliest safe for y=7 is t=17.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at t=17 or later.\n\nBut from y=7 to y=8, one move.\n\nSo if at t=17 y=7, then take U to y=8 at t=18, then U to y=9 at t=19.\n\nCan we be at y=8 at t=17? To be at y=8 at t=17, we need to be at y=7 at t=16 or y=8 at t=16 or y=9 at t=16, but y=9 not yet.\n\nBut at t=16, if we are at y=7, unsafe; if at y=8, also unsafe at t=16.\n\ny=6 at t=16, safe, but then to y=7 at t=17, y=8 at t=18, y=9 at t=19.\n\nIf we are at y=8 at t=17, we need to be at y=7 at t=16 or y=8 at t=16 or y=9 at t=16.\n\nBut t=16 y=7 or y=8 both unsafe, y=9 not possible.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 at t=17.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be at y=7 before t=17.\n\nTherefore, the earliest to be at y=7 is t=17, at y=8 is t=18, at y=9 is t=19.\n\nAnd we can achieve that with the sequence I had earlier.\n\nBut in that sequence, we have extra stays.\n\nFrom start to y=6 at t=14, then stay at y=6 for t=15 and t=16, then move up.\n\nBut we can reach y=6 earlier? No, t=14 is earliest for y=6.\n\nt=10 y=2, t=11 y=3, t=12 y=4, t=13 y=5, t=14 y=6. Yes.\n\nThen at t=14 y=6, we need to stay for two turns: at t=14 take S to stay at y=6 for t=15, then at t=15 take S to stay at y=6 for t=16, then at t=16 take U to go to y=7 at t=17.\n\nThen t=17 take U to y=8 at t=18.\n\nt=18 take U to y=9 at t=19.\n\nSo actions:\n\nt=10: U (to y=3)\n\nt=11: U (to y=4)\n\nt=12: U (to y=5)\n\nt=13: U (to y=6)\n\nt=14: S (stay y=6)\n\nt=15: S (stay y=6)\n\nt=16: U (to y=7)\n\nt=17: U (to y=8)\n\nt=18: U (to y=9)\n\nAt t=19, y=9.\n\nH=9 turns.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer?\n\nFor example, at t=14 y=6, instead of staying, we could go down to y=5 at t=15, but that would be worse, as we need to come back.\n\nOr, we could be on y=5 or other safe levels.\n\nBut since we have to wait until t=17 to go to y=7, we need to spend two turns somewhere between y=2 and y=6.\n\ny=6 is safe, so staying there is fine.\n\nWe could go up to y=6 earlier? No.\n\nPerhaps we can be at a lower y and come up later, but that might take more time.\n\nFor example, from t=10 y=2, we could stay or go down, but that increases time.\n\nSo minimal is to go up to y=6 as fast as possible, then wait for two turns, then go up.\n\nThus H=9, reaching at t=19.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions for the sequence.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns starting from t_1=10.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 10: action U\n\nTurn 11: action U\n\nTurn 12: action U\n\nTurn 13: action U\n\nTurn 14: action S\n\nTurn 15: action S\n\nTurn 16: action U\n\nTurn 17: action U\n\nTurn 18: action U\n\nAfter turn 18 action, we go to y_{19}=9.\n\ny_{19} is at turn 19.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=10 to t=18, that's 9 actions: a_{10} to a_{18}, and after that, at turn t=19, position y_{19}=9.\n\nH=9.\n\nBut we can reach at t=18? Is it possible?\n\nTo be at y=9 at t=18, we need y_{18}=9.\n\ny_{18}=9 means at turn 18, position is (0,9).\n\nTo be there, we must have been at y=8 or y=9 or y=10 (invalid) at t=17.\n\ny=9 is safe, but we need to reach it.\n\nIf at t=17 we are at y=8, take U to y=9 at t=18.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=17, as before, we need to be at y=7 or y=8 at t=16.\n\nBut t=16 y=7 or y=8 unsafe.\n\nIf at t=17 y=7, take U to y=8 at t=18, then to y=9 at t=19.\n\nCannot reach y=9 at t=18.\n\nBecause to be at y=9 at t=18, we must have taken action from y=8 at t=17.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=17, we need to have been at y=7 or y=8 at t=16, which is unsafe.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach y=9 before t=19.\n\nThus minimal H=9.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have two S actions, but we could have different paths.\n\nFor example, from t=14 y=6, we could go down to y=5 at t=15, but then at t=15 y=5, which is safe, then at t=15 take U to y=6 at t=16, then at t=16 take U to y=7 at t=17, etc., but that takes same or more: from t=14 y=6, D to y=5 at t=15, then U to y=6 at t=16, then U to y=7 at t=17, then U to y=8 at t=18, U to y=9 at t=19. But we used D and U instead of S and S, but still to y=6 at t=16, same as before. Worse because we went down and up.\n\nSo staying is better.\n\nWe could go to y=4 or something, but no need.\n\nSo the sequence with two S at t=14 and t=15 is fine.\n\nIn the action list:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAfter Turn 18 action, at turn 19, y=9.\n\nThe answer should list actions from t=10 to t=10+H-1, with H=9, so t=10 to t=18.\n\nIn the sequence above, actions from turn 10 to turn 18.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut let's make sure about freeway 7 and 8 at other times.\n\nFor example, at t=17 y=7: ΔT=7, freeway 7 car3: [-41+42, -30+42]=[1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=18 y=8: ΔT=8, freeway 8 car3: [-41+48, -30+48]=[7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAnd other freeways always safe.\n\nAlso, at t=15 and t=16, we are at y=6, freeway 6, which has car (12,1,right,6), span [1+6ΔT,12+6ΔT], at ΔT=5 (t=15), [1+30,12+30]=[31,42], 0 not in; ΔT=6 [1+36,12+36]=[37,48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: & U \\end{array} }\n\nBut the turn labels, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\", etc.\n\nt_1=10.\n\nAnd H=9, from t=10 to t=18, 9 actions.\n\nWe could have a different sequence, but this should be minimal.\n\nAnother idea: since we need to be at y=7 and y=8 later, but we could go up to y=5 and stay, but similar.\n\nOr, at t=10, we start at y=2, we could stay or go down to y=1, but that wastes time.\n\nFor example, go down to y=1 at some point, but y=1 is freeway 1, which is safe, but going down then up takes more moves.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, this should be the minimal.\n\nSo the answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) if the player is on freeway \\(y_T\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y_T \\leq 8\\)) and the x-position 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Positions and Safe Freeways\n- Freeways 1 to 6 are always safe because the car spans never contain 0 for any turn \\(T \\geq 10\\).\n- Freeway 7 is unsafe at turns \\(T = 15\\) and \\(T = 16\\) due to car \\((-30, -41, \\text{right}, 6)\\) having a span containing 0 at these times.\n- Freeway 8 is unsafe at turns \\(T = 15\\) and \\(T = 16\\) due to car \\((-30, -41, \\text{right}, 6)\\) having a span containing 0 at these times.\n- All other turns for freeways 7 and 8 are safe.\n- Positions \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) are always safe as they have no cars.\n\n### Strategy to Minimize Turns\n- The player starts at \\(y = 2\\) at turn 10.\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\), a net increase of 7 in the y-position is required, necessitating at least 7 \"U\" actions.\n- The earliest possible turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) is turn 17 with 7 consecutive \"U\" actions. However, this path would place the player at:\n  - \\(y = 7\\) at turn 15 (unsafe for freeway 7).\n  - \\(y = 8\\) at turn 16 (unsafe for freeway 8).\n- Thus, the direct path causes collisions at turns 15 and 16.\n- To avoid collisions, the player must not be on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at turns 15 or 16.\n- The earliest safe turn to be on \\(y = 7\\) is turn 17, and on \\(y = 8\\) is turn 18, leading to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19.\n- The minimal sequence involves:\n  - Moving up to \\(y = 6\\) as quickly as possible by turn 14 (using 4 \"U\" actions from turn 10 to 13).\n  - Staying at \\(y = 6\\) for turns 15 and 16 (using \"S\" actions) to avoid the unsafe freeways 7 and 8 at turns 15 and 16.\n  - Moving up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 17, \\(y = 8\\) at turn 18, and \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19 (using \"U\" actions).\n\n### Sequence of Actions\n- Total turns: \\(H = 9\\) (from turn 10 to turn 18, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19).\n- Actions:\n  - Turn 10: \"U\" → to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 11.\n  - Turn 11: \"U\" → to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 12.\n  - Turn 12: \"U\" → to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 13.\n  - Turn 13: \"U\" → to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 14.\n  - Turn 14: \"S\" → stay at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 15 (safe, freeway 6 always safe).\n  - Turn 15: \"S\" → stay at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 16 (safe, freeway 6 always safe).\n  - Turn 16: \"U\" → to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 17 (safe, freeway 7 safe at turn 17).\n  - Turn 17: \"U\" → to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 18 (safe, freeway 8 safe at turn 18).\n  - Turn 18: \"U\" → to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 9\\) turns, avoiding all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: & U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 11. The player moves up, down, or stays with actions U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe car positions are given for turn t_1=11, and they move left or right based on their direction and speed. I need to find a sequence of actions starting from turn t_1=11 for H turns until y=9 is reached.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y_T where y_T is between 1 and 8, and at that turn, for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span. The span is the interval occupied by the car, and it moves with constant speed.\n\nImportant note: if the player moves to a different y at turn T, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, the player is on y_T, and if they move, at turn T+1 they are on y_{T+1}. So for collision at turn T, it's based on y_T and the car positions at turn T.\n\nAlso, for cars, the span at turn T is calculated from the initial span at t_1 and the speed. Since t_1=11, for any turn T >= t_1, the car's position at T is offset by s * (T - t_1) in the appropriate direction.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t = 0 for simplicity, but since actions start from t_1, I'll keep it as t relative to t_1.\n\nSet t=0 as turn t_1=11. So at t=0, player is at y=3.\n\nI need to reach y=9 in minimal H, so at some turn t=H, y_{t_1 + H} = 9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, actions a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, the position is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with action at time t affecting y_{t+1}.\n\nAt time t, action a_t is taken, which determines Δy_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThe position at time t is given, and action at t moves to position at t+1.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, if player is on freeway k (y_T = k), and for some car on freeway k, 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\n0 here is the x-position? I think so, since the grid is 2D, but player is always at x=0, I assume, since it says \"position (0, y_t)\", and cars are on the freeways, so we care about when the car spans cover x=0.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the cars are given for each freeway at turn t_1=11.\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8, but not all have cars. The table shows:\n\nFreeway 1: one car (60,49, right, 12) — head h=60, tail τ=49, direction right, speed 12.\n\nSince direction is right, for right-moving cars, the span is [τ, h], so at t_1, [49,60] since τ=49, h=60.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] but here all cars seem right-moving except possibly, but in freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars.\n\nList all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=60, τ=49, d=right, s=12) → span at t_1: since right, [τ, h] = [49,60]\n\nFreeway 2: (18,7,right,6) → [7,18]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? (18,7,right,6) → [7,18]\n\nFreeway 4: (18,7,right,6) → [7,18]\n\nFreeway 5: (18,7,right,6) → [7,18]\n\nFreeway 6: (18,7,right,6) → [7,18]\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (18,7,right,6), (54,43,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFor each, spans: [7,18], [43,54], and for (-24,-35), since τ=-35, h=-24, and right, so [τ,h] = [-35,-24]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as freeway 7? (18,7,right,6), (54,43,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6) → spans [7,18], [43,54], [-35,-24]\n\nNow, at any future turn T, for a car, the span shifts by s*(T - t_1) in the direction of movement.\n\nSince all are right-moving, for each car, the span at time T is [τ + s*(T - t_1), h + s*(T - t_1)]\n\nBecause for right-moving, it increases.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving it would decrease, but here all right.\n\nt_1 = 11.\n\nSo let me define the time offset. Set τ = T - t_1, so at time step τ relative to t_1.\n\nAt τ = 0, we have initial positions.\n\nFor a car with initial τ, h, s, at time τ (meaning T - t_1 = τ), the span is [τ_init + s*τ, h_init + s*τ] for right-moving cars.\n\nCollision at time τ if player is on freeway k (y_τ = k, but y_τ is the position at time τ, which corresponds to turn t_1 + τ.\n\nPlayer position: at time τ, y_τ.\n\nAction at time τ determines Δy_τ, and y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ.\n\ny_τ is the position during turn τ, I think.\n\nThe turn is defined as the time when action is taken.\n\nAt turn T (which is t_1 + τ for τ=0,1,2,...), player is at position (0, y_T), takes action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThen at turn T, for collision check, player is on freeway y_T, and we check if for that freeway, at time T, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nThe car span at time T is as given.\n\nSince T = t_1 + τ, and τ = T - t_1.\n\nIn terms of τ, let's use τ for simplicity.\n\nSet τ = 0 at t_1=11.\n\nAt τ=0, player at y=3.\n\nAction a_0 at τ=0 affects y_1, and so on.\n\nPosition y_τ at time τ.\n\nAfter H actions, from τ=0 to τ=H-1, we have positions from y_0 to y_H, and we want y_H = 9.\n\nAt time τ, position y_τ, and we want to reach y_τ =9 for some τ as small as possible.\n\nSince we start at y_0=3, and need to get to y=9, which is 6 steps up, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H might be more than 6.\n\nMinimal H is at least 6 if no cars, but there are cars, so we need to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, collision at time τ if y_τ is between 1 and 8, and for freeway k=y_τ, there is a car such that 0 is in [τ_init + s*τ, h_init + s*τ] for that car.\n\nSince all cars right-moving.\n\nτ_init and h_init are at τ=0.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and when 0 is covered.\n\nSince the player must not be on a freeway when 0 is covered by a car on that row.\n\nBut only for freeways 1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, no cars.\n\nThe problem says: avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nAt y=9, it's the goal, so no car.\n\nSimilarly y=0, bottom.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when 0 is in the span for some car, meaning when the car covers x=0.\n\nFor a given car, the span at time τ is [τ_init + s τ, h_init + s τ] since right-moving.\n\n0 is in this interval if τ_init + s τ <= 0 <= h_init + s τ.\n\nWhich is equivalent to -h_init <= s τ - (-τ_init) better to solve inequality.\n\n0 >= τ_init + s τ and 0 <= h_init + s τ\n\nSo s τ >= -τ_init and s τ <= -h_init? Let's see.\n\nFrom τ_init + s τ <= 0 <= h_init + s τ\n\nFirst inequality: τ_init + s τ <= 0 ⇒ s τ <= -τ_init\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= h_init + s τ ⇒ s τ >= -h_init\n\nSo for each car, the time τ when it covers 0 is when -h_init <= s τ <= -τ_init\n\nSince s τ >= -h_init and s τ <= -τ_init\n\nThen τ >= ceil( -h_init / s ) and τ <= floor( -τ_init / s )? Since τ integer.\n\nτ is discrete, turns.\n\ns τ >= -h_init ⇒ τ >= ceil( -h_init / s )\n\nAnd s τ <= -τ_init ⇒ τ <= floor( -τ_init / s )\n\nThen if there is integer τ satisfying both, then at that τ, 0 is covered.\n\nOtherwise not.\n\nNow, since the car exists only when the span is defined, but here spans are infinite, I think, or we assume cars are always there, moving.\n\nThe span shifts, so for any τ, it's defined.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to know for which τ, there is a car covering x=0.\n\nBut multiple cars per freeway possible.\n\nFor freeway k, collision at τ if y_τ = k and min over cars on k of the condition, but actually if any car covers 0, then collision if player is there.\n\nSo for each k, I need the set of τ where some car on row k covers x=0.\n\nThen player should not be on row k at that τ.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, τ_init=49, h_init=60, s=12\n\nThen s τ >= -h_init = -60 ⇒ τ >= ceil(-60/12) = ceil(-5) = -5? τ >= ceil(-60/12) = ceil(-5) = -5\n\nBut τ is time offset, τ >=0 since we start from τ=0, but the car might have covered 0 before, but we care only for τ >=0.\n\nSimilarly, s τ <= -τ_init = -49 ⇒ τ <= floor(-49/12) = floor(-4.083) = -5? Since -4.083, floor is -5? No.\n\nfloor(-4.083) is -5? Floor is greatest integer less than or equal, so -4.083, less than -4, greater than -5, so floor is -5? No.\n\n-4.083, integers: -5 < -4.083 < -4, so greatest integer <= -4.083 is -5? No, -5 is less than -4.083, -4 is greater.\n\n-4.083, between -5 and -4, closer to -4, but floor is down, so <= -4.083, so -5, -4.083 > -5, -4.083 < -4, so integers <= -4.083 are -5, -6, etc., but greatest is -5? -5 = -5.0 < -4.083? -5.0 < -4.083, yes, but -4.0 > -4.083? -4.0 = -4.000 > -4.083, so -4.000 is greater than -4.083, so not <=.\n\n-4.083, numbers less than or equal: ..., -5, -4.1, etc., but integers: -5, -6, ..., since -5 = -5.0 < -4.083, and -4 = -4.0 > -4.083, so no integer between, so floor(-4.083) = -5.\n\nSimilarly, ceil(-4.083) = -4, since ceil is smallest integer greater than or equal.\n\nBut for inequality:\n\ns τ <= -τ_init = -49\n\n12 τ <= -49\n\nτ <= -49/12 = -4.0833\n\nSince τ integer, τ <= -5? τ <= floor(-4.0833) = -5, because -5 <= -4.0833? -5 = -5.0 < -4.0833, so -5.0 <= -4.0833 is true? -5.0 is less than -4.0833, so -5.0 <= -4.0833 is true because -5.0 is smaller.\n\nNumerically, -5.0 < -4.0833, so -5.0 <= -4.0833 is true.\n\nBut -4.0 = -4.0 > -4.0833, so -4.0 <= -4.0833 is false.\n\nSo τ <= -4.0833 means τ <= -5 for integers, since τ=-5, -6,... are <= -4.0833, τ=-4 is not.\n\nSimilarly, s τ >= -h_init = -60\n\n12 τ >= -60\n\nτ >= -60/12 = -5\n\nτ >= -5\n\nSo for the car, 0 covered when τ >= -5 and τ <= -5\n\nτ >= -5 and τ <= -5, so only at τ= -5.\n\nBut τ= -5 is before our time, since we start at τ=0, so for τ >=0, this car never covers x=0 on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nLet's compute for each.\n\nFreeway 1: car covers 0 at τ such that 12τ >= -60 and 12τ <= -49\n\nτ >= -5 and τ <= -4.083, so τ <= -5 since integer? τ >= -5 and τ <= -4.083, so possible τ= -5 only, since τ=-5, 12*(-5)= -60 >= -60, and -60 <= -49 true? -60 <= -49 yes.\n\nτ= -4, 12*(-4)= -48 >= -60 true, but -48 <= -49? -48 > -49, so -48 <= -49 false.\n\nSo only τ= -5.\n\nBefore τ=0, so for τ>=0, no coverage on freeway 1.\n\nNow freeway 2: car (18,7,right,6) so τ_init=7, h_init=18, s=6\n\ns τ >= -h_init = -18 ⇒ 6τ >= -18 ⇒ τ >= -3\n\ns τ <= -τ_init = -7 ⇒ 6τ <= -7 ⇒ τ <= -7/6 = -1.1667 ⇒ τ <= -2 since τ integer? 6τ <= -7, τ <= floor(-7/6) = floor(-1.1667) = -2? -1.1667, floor is -2? -2 < -1.1667 < -1, so floor(-1.1667) = -2.\n\nThen τ <= -2 and τ >= -3.\n\nSo τ= -3, -2.\n\nAt τ= -3: 6*(-3)= -18 >= -18, and -18 <= -7 true.\n\nτ= -2: 6*(-2)= -12 >= -18 true, -12 <= -7 true? -12 <= -7 yes.\n\nτ= -1: 6*(-1)= -6 >= -18 true, but -6 <= -7? -6 > -7, so false.\n\nSo covers at τ= -3 and -2, before τ=0, so for τ>=0, no coverage on freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as 2, car (18,7,right,6), same as above, covers at τ= -3,-2, not for τ>=0.\n\nFreeway 4: same.\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (18,7,right,6) same as above, covers at τ= -3,-2, not τ>=0.\n\nSecond car: (54,43,right,6) τ_init=43, h_init=54, s=6\n\ns τ >= -h_init = -54 ⇒ 6τ >= -54 ⇒ τ >= -9\n\ns τ <= -τ_init = -43 ⇒ 6τ <= -43 ⇒ τ <= floor(-43/6) = floor(-7.1667) = -8? -7.1667, floor is -8? -8 < -7.1667 < -7, so floor is -8.\n\nThen τ >= -9 and τ <= -8.\n\nSo τ= -9, -8.\n\nAt τ= -9: 6*(-9)= -54 >= -54, -54 <= -43 true.\n\nτ= -8: 6*(-8)= -48 >= -54 true, -48 <= -43 true.\n\nτ= -7: 6*(-7)= -42 >= -54 true, but -42 <= -43? -42 > -43, false.\n\nSo covers at τ= -9,-8, before τ=0.\n\nThird car on freeway 7: (-24,-35,right,6) τ_init=-35, h_init=-24, s=6\n\nSince right-moving, span [τ_init, h_init] = [-35,-24] at τ=0.\n\ns τ >= -h_init = -(-24) = 24? Let's apply formula.\n\ns τ >= -h_init\n\nh_init = -24, so -h_init = -(-24) = 24\n\ns τ <= -τ_init\n\nτ_init = -35, so -τ_init = -(-35) = 35\n\ns=6\n\nSo 6τ >= 24 ⇒ τ >= 4\n\n6τ <= 35 ⇒ τ <= floor(35/6) = floor(5.833) = 5\n\nSo τ >=4 and τ <=5, so τ=4,5\n\nAt τ=4: 6*4=24 >=24, and 24 <=35 true.\n\nAt τ=5: 30 >=24, 30<=35 true.\n\nAt τ=6: 36 >=24 true, but 36<=35? false.\n\nSo this car covers x=0 at τ=4 and 5.\n\nNow, for freeway 7, at τ=4 and τ=5, the third car covers x=0.\n\nThe other cars don't cover for τ>=0.\n\nSo on freeway 7, collision if player there at τ=4 or 5.\n\nNow freeway 8: same cars as 7? The table says for freeway 8: (18,7,right,6), (54,43,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6) same as freeway 7.\n\nSo identical to freeway 7, so covers x=0 at τ=4 and 5.\n\nNow freeway 1 to 6 have no coverage for τ>=0, as we saw.\n\nFreeway 1: no coverage\n\n2-6: no coverage\n\n7 and 8: coverage at τ=4 and 5.\n\nBut freeway 7 and 8 are rows y=7 and y=8.\n\nPlayer starts at y=3 at τ=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is safe, but we are going up.\n\nSince freeways 1-6 have no cars covering x=0 for τ>=0, that means on rows 1 to 6, it is always safe to be there, because no car ever covers x=0 at any time τ>=0.\n\nSimilarly, for rows 7 and 8, it is unsafe only at τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nSpecifically, if player is on row 7 or 8 at turn τ=4 or τ=5, collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nNow, player starts at y=3 at τ=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal steps to go from y=3 to y=9 is 6 steps up, but we might need to avoid being on row 7 or 8 at τ=4 or 5.\n\nτ=4 and 5 correspond to turns t_1 +4 and t_1 +5, but in terms of our time, τ=4 and 5.\n\nNow, let's think about the timeline.\n\nPlayer position at time τ: y_τ\n\nAction at τ determines y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy, with Δy from action.\n\nWe need to find actions from τ=0 to τ=H-1 such that y_H =9 for some H.\n\nSince we start at y_0=3, and y_H=9, the net change must be +6, so number of U minus number of D must be 6, and S actions add turns but no change.\n\nTo minimize H, we should minimize S actions, so ideally no S, just U and possibly D if needed for waiting, but D would decrease y, which might require more U later, so it might increase H.\n\nSince rows 1-6 are always safe, we can stay there if needed.\n\nRows 7 and 8 are safe except at τ=4 and 5.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some point.\n\nThe critical times are τ=4 and 5, when row 7 and 8 are dangerous.\n\nWe need to ensure that if player is on row 7 or 8 at τ=4 or 5, collision, so we must not be there at those times.\n\nAt other times, row 7 and 8 are safe.\n\nNow, since we go from y=3 to y=9, we must pass through row 7 and 8 at some point.\n\nBut we can choose when to be there.\n\nThe simplest way is to go directly up as fast as possible.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=3.\n\nIf we go up every step: actions U,U,U,U,U,U to reach y=9 in 6 steps.\n\nThen positions:\n\nτ=0: y=3 (safe, row 3)\n\nAction U: y_{1} = 3+1=4\n\nτ=1: y=4 (safe)\n\nAction U: y_{2}=5\n\nτ=2: y=5 (safe)\n\nAction U: y_{3}=6\n\nτ=3: y=6 (safe)\n\nAction U: y_{4}=7\n\nNow at τ=4, y=7\n\nBut τ=4, row 7 is unsafe, collision!\n\nSimilarly, if we continue: action U at τ=4: y_{5}=8\n\nAt τ=5, y=8, row 8 unsafe at τ=5, collision again.\n\nThen action U: y_{6}=9, at τ=6, y=9, safe, but we had collisions at τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nSo not good.\n\nWe need to avoid being on row 7 at τ=4 or on row 8 at τ=5? Specifically, at τ=4, if on row 7, collision; at τ=5, if on row 7 or 8? Row 7 and 8 both unsafe at τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nAt τ=4, row 7 and 8 are both unsafe, since both have cars covering x=0.\n\nSimilarly at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=4, for freeway 7, cars cover, so if player on y=7, collision; similarly for y=8.\n\nAt τ=5, same.\n\nSo at τ=4 and τ=5, rows 7 and 8 are both occupied by cars at x=0, so player cannot be on either row at those times.\n\nIn the direct path, at τ=4, we are forced to be on row 7 if going up, and collision.\n\nSo we need to delay or something.\n\nWe could go up slower or stay on lower rows.\n\nFor example, we could stay on row 6 for some time.\n\nRow 6 is safe at all times, since no cars cover x=0.\n\nSimilarly rows 1-6 safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, so we must eventually go up.\n\nThe dangerous times are τ=4 and 5.\n\nWe should not be on row 7 or 8 during τ=4 and 5.\n\nSo possible to be on row 7 or 8 before τ=4 or after τ=5.\n\nFor example, go up to row 6 and stay there until after τ=5, then go to 7,8,9.\n\nSince row 6 is safe.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=3.\n\nWe need to get to row 6 as soon as possible or not, but we can stay.\n\nMinimal H: if we go directly, H=6, but collisions.\n\nSo we need to add some waiting.\n\nWe can go to row 6 and wait for τ=4 and 5 to pass.\n\nThen after τ=5, go up.\n\nτ=5 is time when position is considered.\n\nAt τ=5, if on row 6, safe.\n\nThen after action, we can move up.\n\nSequence:\n\nAt τ=0: y=3, can action U to go to 4, or S, or D, but D down might not help.\n\nSince rows 3 to 6 safe, go up to 6 quickly.\n\nFor example:\n\nτ=0: y=3, action U → y_{1} =4\n\nτ=1: y=4, action U → y_{2}=5\n\nτ=2: y=5, action U → y_{3}=6\n\nτ=3: y=6, now at τ=3, safe.\n\nWe are at y=6, and τ=3.\n\nNext, if we action U at τ=3, y_{4}=7, but at τ=4, y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nSo instead, we should action S at τ=3, so y_{4}=6 (stay)\n\nThen at τ=4, y=6, which is safe, row 6 no issue.\n\nThen at τ=4, we can action S again or U.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nAt τ=4, y=6, action S → y_{5}=6\n\nThen at τ=5, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at τ=5, action U → y_{6}=7\n\nNow at τ=6, y=7, which is after τ=5, so row 7 is safe now, since only unsafe at τ=4,5.\n\nτ=6>5, so safe.\n\nThen action U at τ=6 → y_{7}=8\n\nAt τ=7, y=8, row 8 safe after τ=5.\n\nThen action U at τ=7 → y_{8}=9\n\nAt τ=8, y=9, reached.\n\nH=8, from τ=0 to τ=7 actions, 8 actions, positions from y0 to y8.\n\ny0=3, after 8 actions, y8=9.\n\nBut we can reach earlier?\n\nIn this sequence, we used two S actions at τ=3 and τ=4? Let's list:\n\nτ | action at τ | y after action, i.e., y_{τ+1}\n\nBetter to list position at time τ and action at τ.\n\nTime τ: position y_τ, action a_τ, then y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy\n\nAt τ=0: y_0=3, we can take action.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt τ=0: y=3, action U → y1=4\n\nτ=1: y=4, action U → y2=5\n\nτ=2: y=5, action U → y3=6\n\nτ=3: y=6, now instead of U, action S → y4=6\n\nτ=4: y=6, action S → y5=6? Or action U?\n\nIn my earlier, I said action S at τ=4 to stay until after τ=5.\n\nAt τ=4: y=6, if action S, y5=6\n\nThen at τ=5: y=6, safe, then action U → y6=7\n\nAt τ=6: y=7, safe (since τ=6>5), action U → y7=8\n\nAt τ=7: y=8, action U → y8=9\n\nAt τ=8: y=9, done.\n\nWe reached at τ=8.\n\nBut at τ=8, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from τ=0 to τ=7, 8 actions.\n\nBut we started at τ=0, actions at τ=0 to τ=7 for H=8.\n\ny after H actions is y_H.\n\nIn this case, after 8 actions, y8=9.\n\nBut we can reduce H.\n\nNotice that at τ=3, we are at y=6, and τ=4 and 5 are dangerous for 7 and 8.\n\nInstead of staying at y=6 for two turns, we could go down to a lower row, but that might take more time.\n\nFor example, go to y=5 or something, but row 5 is also safe, but going down and up takes extra steps.\n\nSo staying at y=6 is fine.\n\nBut we used two S actions, which cost two extra turns.\n\nSince rows 1-6 are safe, we can be on any of them during τ=4 and 5.\n\nIn the sequence above, we are on y=6 at τ=4 and τ=5, which is safe.\n\nBut we can reach earlier by not waiting so long.\n\nFor example, we could go up to y=6 at τ=3, then at τ=3, instead of S, we could do nothing, but we have to take action.\n\nAt τ=3, y=6, we can take action D to go down to y=5 at τ=4, but then at τ=4, y=5, safe, but we are lower, so need to go up later, which might take more steps.\n\nFor example:\n\nτ=0: y=3, U → y1=4\n\nτ=1: y=4, U → y2=5\n\nτ=2: y=5, U → y3=6\n\nτ=3: y=6, action D → y4=5 (down to 5)\n\nThen at τ=4: y=5, safe, action U → y5=6\n\nAt τ=5: y=6, safe, action U → y6=7\n\nAt τ=6: y=7, action U → y7=8\n\nAt τ=7: y=8, action U → y8=9\n\nSame as before, 8 steps, but now we have a D action, which didn't help, and we still have y=9 at τ=8.\n\nWorse because we went down and up.\n\nSo not better.\n\nAt τ=3, y=6, action S → y4=6\n\nThen at τ=4, y=6, instead of S, we can action U to y5=7? But at τ=5, y=7, which is row 7 at τ=5, unsafe! Because at τ=5, row 7 is covered.\n\nIn my first sequence, I had to wait until after τ=5 to go up.\n\nAt τ=4, if I action U from y=6, y5=7, then at τ=5, y=7, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I action at τ=4 to go to 7, y5=7, position at τ=5 is y=7, unsafe.\n\nSo I must not be on row 7 at τ=5.\n\nTherefore, at τ=4, I should not go to row 7 if τ=5 is soon.\n\nIn this case, at τ=4, if I go up, y5=7, which is at τ=5, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, y5=6, safe at τ=5.\n\nThen after τ=5, I can go up.\n\nThe earliest I can go up is after τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, after action, I can move to y=7.\n\nAt τ=5, position y=5, I take action to set y6.\n\nIf at τ=5, I am at y=6, and action U, then y6=7 at τ=6.\n\nNow, is there a way to be at y=7 before τ=4 or after τ=5.\n\nBefore τ=4: for example, at τ=3, if I am at y=7.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at τ=3, I need to have reached earlier.\n\nFrom start, at τ=0, y=3.\n\nIf I go up fast: τ=0: U → y1=4\n\nτ=1: U → y2=5\n\nτ=2: U → y3=6\n\nNow at τ=2, y=6, to be at y=7 at τ=3, I need action U at τ=2: y3=7\n\nThen at τ=3, y=7.\n\nNow τ=3, is row 7 safe? We need to check if at τ=3, for row 7, cars cover x=0.\n\nEarlier, for freeway 7, we have coverage only at τ=4 and 5, not at τ=3.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=3, no coverage, so safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=7, I can action U to y4=8\n\nThen at τ=4, y=8, but τ=4, row 8 is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf at τ=3, I action S, y4=7, but at τ=4, y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf I action D, y4=6, then at τ=4, y=6, safe, but I was at y=7 at τ=3, which is safe, but then I go down, waste.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=6, then I need to go up later.\n\nBut I reached y=7 at τ=3, which is before danger.\n\nThen from there, I need to avoid τ=4 and 5 on row 7 or 8.\n\nAt τ=3, y=7, if I stay, at τ=4, y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf I go up to y=8 at τ=4, then at τ=4, y=8, unsafe.\n\nIf I go down to y=6 at τ=4, then at τ=4, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at τ=4, y=6, I can action S or U.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to go up later.\n\nFor example:\n\nSequence:\n\nτ=0: y=3, U → y1=4\n\nτ=1: y=4, U → y2=5\n\nτ=2: y=5, U → y3=6? Earlier I said to reach y=7 at τ=3.\n\nFrom τ=2: y=5, action U → y3=6? No.\n\nAt τ=2, y=5, action U → y3=6\n\nTo have y3=7, I need at τ=2, y=6? No.\n\ny at τ=3 is set by action at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, position y=5, if action U, y3=6.\n\nTo have y3=7, I need to be at y=6 at τ=2 and action U.\n\nBut at τ=1, y=4, action U → y2=5\n\nAt τ=2, y=5, not 6.\n\nSo to reach y=7 at τ=3:\n\nAt τ=2, I need y=6 and action U.\n\nSo y at τ=2 must be 6.\n\nAt τ=2, y=6, action U → y3=7.\n\nNow, to have y=6 at τ=2:\n\nFrom start: τ=0: y=3, U → y1=4\n\nτ=1: y=4, U → y2=5? Then at τ=2, y=5, not 6.\n\nNeed to be faster.\n\nτ=0: y=3, U → y1=4\n\nτ=1: y=4, U → y2=5? Still y2=5.\n\nFrom y=3 to y=6 in two steps: impossible, since each U increases by 1, so from 3 to 4,5,6 in three steps: τ=0 U to4, τ=1 U to5, τ=2 U to6, so y3=6 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=6, as before.\n\nCannot be at y=7 at τ=3 with U only, since it takes three steps to go up three levels to y=6 at τ=3.\n\ny=3 at τ=0, after one U, y1=4 at τ=1; after two U, y2=5 at τ=2; after three U, y3=6 at τ=3.\n\nSo earliest to be at y=6 is τ=3.\n\nTo be at y=7, at τ=4 with action U at τ=3 from y=6.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=7 is unsafe.\n\nIf I want to be at y=7 earlier, cannot.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=7 after τ=5, at τ=6.\n\nSo the safe times to be on row 7 are τ <=3 or τ >=6.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nτ <=3 or τ >=6.\n\nBecause unsafe at τ=4,5.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nWe can be on row 7 at τ=3 or before, or at τ=6 or after.\n\nBut to be at row 7 at τ=3, we need y=7 at τ=3.\n\nAs above, with three U from start, we reach y=6 at τ=3, not y=7.\n\ny=7 at τ=3 is impossible from y=3 at τ=0 with U only; it takes at least four steps to reach y=7: τ=0 U to4, τ=1 U to5, τ=2 U to6, τ=3 U to7, so y4=7 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=7 at τ=6: for example, by waiting.\n\nBut let's find minimal H.\n\nAnother idea: go to row 8 or 9 before τ=4, but row 9 is safe, but to reach row 9 from row 3, min 6 steps, to be at y=9 at τ=6, for example.\n\nBut at τ=4 and 5, if on row 7 or 8, problem.\n\nBut if I can be on row 9 before τ=4, impossible since τ=4 is early.\n\ny=3 at τ=0, after k U, y_k = 3+k.\n\nTo have y_k=9, k=6, so at τ=6, y=9.\n\nBut during the path, I might be on row 7 or 8 at τ=4 or 5.\n\nFor example, if I go directly: y4=7 at τ=4, y5=8 at τ=5, both unsafe.\n\nSo need to adjust.\n\nPerhaps go up to row 6 by τ=3, stay during τ=4 and 5, then go to 7,8,9 after.\n\nAs in first sequence.\n\nBut H=8.\n\nCan I reach earlier than τ=8?\n\nFor example, if I can be on row 7 at τ=3, but I can't, as above.\n\nAt τ=3, max y=6.\n\nSo I must be on row 7 at some point after τ=5.\n\nEarliest at τ=6, y=7.\n\nThen y=8 at τ=7, y=9 at τ=8.\n\nBut I can be on row 8 at τ=6 if I reach faster, but from row 3, to row 8, min 5 steps: τ=0 U to4, τ=1 U to5, τ=2 U to6, τ=3 U to7, τ=4 U to8, so y5=8 at τ=5, which is unsafe.\n\nCannot be at row 8 before τ=5 safely? Row 8 unsafe at τ=4 and 5, so safe at τ=3 or before, or τ=6 or after.\n\nBut at τ=3, max y=6, so cannot be on row 8 before τ=4, and at τ=4 unsafe.\n\nEarliest safe on row 8 is τ=6.\n\nSimilarly for row 7, earliest safe is τ=6.\n\nNow, to reach row 7 at τ=6, I need to be at y=6 at τ=5 and action U.\n\nSimilarly, to be at row 8 at τ=6, I need y=7 at τ=5 and action U, but at τ=5, if on row 7, unsafe, so I cannot be on row 7 at τ=5 to move to 8.\n\nAction at τ=5 sets y6.\n\nIf at τ=5, I am on row 6, action U, y6=7.\n\nThen at τ=6, y=7.\n\nIf I want y6=8, I need to be on row 7 at τ=5 and action U, but at τ=5, if on row 7, collision, impossible.\n\nTherefore, the earliest I can be on row 7 is at τ=6, by being on row 6 at τ=5 and moving up.\n\nSimilarly, earliest on row 8 at τ=7, by moving from row 7 at τ=6.\n\nThen row 9 at τ=8.\n\nSo with that, I need to be at row 6 at τ=5.\n\nNow, from start, at τ=0, y=3.\n\nI need to reach y=6 by some point.\n\nEarliest at τ=3, y=6, as before.\n\nThen from τ=3 to τ=5, I need to be at y=6 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=3, I am at y=6.\n\nThen I can stay there until τ=5.\n\nSo actions: at τ=3, S; at τ=4, S; then at τ=5, U to y6=7.\n\nThen at τ=6, y=7, U to y7=8\n\nAt τ=7, y=8, U to y8=9\n\nAt τ=8, y=9.\n\nNow, to save time, can I reach y=6 earlier? No, τ=3 earliest.\n\nCan I be at y=6 at τ=5 without waiting two steps? For example, if I go slower to row 6.\n\nBut going slower might make me later.\n\nFor example, if I go up to y=5 at τ=2, then at τ=2, y=5, I can stay or go up.\n\nBut to be at y=6 at τ=5, I need to be at y=6 at τ=5.\n\nIf at τ=2, y=5, I can go to y=6 at τ=3 with U, then same as before, stay at 6 for τ=3,4,5? At τ=3, y=6, then I need to be at y=6 at τ=5, so I have to stay at least from τ=3 to τ=5, which is two S actions or something.\n\nNot better.\n\nPerhaps I can be on a different row during τ=4 and 5, but since I need to be at y=6 at τ=5 to go up, I must be at y=6 at τ=5.\n\nThe only way is to reach y=6 by τ=3 and stay until τ=5.\n\nThus H=8 is minimal? But let's confirm.\n\nAnother possibility: what if I go down to a lower row and come back, but that would take more steps, so H larger.\n\nFor example, go to y=2 or something, but rows 1-6 safe, but going down requires D actions, then need more U, so H larger.\n\nFor instance, at some point go down to y=4, then later up, but net same or more steps.\n\nSo not better.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 8.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have actions from τ=0 to τ=7.\n\nNow, at τ=0 to τ=2: three U to go from y=3 to y=6 at τ=3.\n\nThen τ=3: S to stay at y=6 for τ=4? Action at τ=3 S, so y4=6.\n\nThen τ=4: S, y5=6.\n\nThen τ=5: U, y6=7\n\nτ=6: U, y7=8\n\nτ=7: U, y8=9\n\nSo actions: U,U,U,S,S,U,U,U\n\nBut τ from 0 to 7, 8 actions.\n\nWe can think of the position at critical times.\n\nAt τ=4 and 5, we need y_τ not 7 or 8.\n\nIn this case, at τ=4, y=6; τ=5, y=6, both safe.\n\nThen we move up.\n\nIs there a way with H=7?\n\nSuppose H=7, so y7=9.\n\nThen since start y0=3, need net +6 in 7 steps, so number of U minus number of D must be 6, with total actions 7.\n\nSo possible, for example, 6 U and 1 S, or 7 U and 1 D but D would make net less, so to have net +6, must have at least 6 U, and if 7 actions, one must be S or D, but if D, then need extra U, so with 7 actions, min net if all U is +7, max net if all D -7, but we need net +6, so possible with 6 U and 1 S, or 7 U and 1 D but 7U and 1D would be net +6 if one D and six U? Actions: each U +1, D -1, S 0.\n\nNet change: sum Δy = +6.\n\nWith 7 actions, let U be number of U, D number of D, S number of S, U + D + S =7, and U - D =6.\n\nThen from U - D =6, and U + D + S =7, add them: 2U + S =13, subtract: 2D + S =1.\n\nSince S >=0, 2U + S =13, U <=7.\n\nPossible: if S=1, then 2U=12, U=6, D=0.\n\nIf S=3, 2U=10, U=5, but U-D=6, 5-D=6, D=-1 impossible.\n\nFrom 2U + S=13, and U - D =6.\n\nAlso from 2D + S =1.\n\nSince 2D + S =1, and D,S integers >=0, so possible S=1, D=0; or S=1, D=0 only, since if D=0, S=1; if D=1, 2(1) + S=1, S=-1 impossible. So only possibility: S=1, D=0, U=6.\n\nSo with H=7 actions, we must have exactly 6 U and 1 S, net +6.\n\nNow, positions: start y0=3.\n\nAfter actions, y7=3 + net Δy =3+6=9.\n\nThe S action must be at some point, and we need to avoid being on row 7 or 8 at τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nτ=4 and τ=5 are times during the sequence.\n\nτ from 0 to 6 for actions? Time τ: actions at τ=0 to τ=6 for H=7.\n\nPositions y_τ for τ=0 to 7.\n\ny_τ at τ=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nWe need y_4 and y_5 not 7 or 8.\n\ny_7=9.\n\nSince we have 6 U and 1 S, the position increases by 1 most steps, but with one stay.\n\nThe sequence must have y_τ increasing to 9 with one stay.\n\nFor example, y at τ=0:3\n\nτ=1: after first action, could be 4 or 3 or 2, but since U mostly, likely around 3,4,5...\n\nBut we need to avoid y_4 and y_5 being 7 or 8.\n\nNow, since we go to 9 in 7 steps, with one S, the position y_τ should reach around 6 or 7 by τ=4.\n\nBut y_4 cannot be 7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly y_5 cannot be 7 or 8.\n\nPossible y_4 values: since y_0=3, after 4 actions (τ=0 to3), y4.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=3 determine y4.\n\nEach action increases, decreases, or stays.\n\nBut with 6U and 1S in 7 actions, for the first k actions, the position depends.\n\ny4 = 3 + sum_{i=0}^{3} Δy_i\n\nΔy_i = +1 for U, 0 for S, -1 for D, but we have no D, only U and S.\n\nSince D=0, only U and S.\n\nSo Δy_i = 1 or 0.\n\ny4 = 3 + number of U in first 4 actions.\n\nSimilarly, y5 = 3 + number of U in first 5 actions.\n\nNow, y4 cannot be 7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly y5 cannot be 7 or 8.\n\ny7=9, so total U=6 in 7 actions.\n\ny4: let U4 be number of U in actions τ=0,1,2,3.\n\nThen y4 = 3 + U4\n\nU4 <=4.\n\ny4 cannot be 7 or 8, so 3 + U4 ≠7 and ≠8, so U4 ≠4 and ≠5, but U4 <=4, so U4 <=3, since if U4=4, y4=7, not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, U4=5 impossible.\n\nSo y4 <=6, so U4 <=3.\n\nSimilarly, y5: U5 = number of U in first 5 actions.\n\ny5=3 + U5\n\ny5 cannot be 7 or 8, so 3+U5 ≠7, ≠8, so U5 ≠4, ≠5.\n\nBut U5 <=5, so U5 <=3 or U5=5? U5 ≠4 and ≠5, so U5 <=3 or U5=5? But U5=5 would be y5=8, not allowed, so U5 <=3 or U5=5 not possible, so U5 <=3.\n\nSince U5 ≠4 and ≠5, and U5 integer, U5 <=3 or U5>=6 but U5<=5, so U5 <=3 or U5=5 impossible, so U5 <=3.\n\nSimilarly, from y4, U4 <=3.\n\nNow, total U=6 in 7 actions.\n\nThe actions are from τ=0 to τ=6.\n\nFirst 4 actions: τ=0,1,2,3, determine y4.\n\nU4 <=3.\n\nSimilarly, first 5 actions: τ=0,1,2,3,4, determine y5.\n\nU5 <=3.\n\nNow, after that, we have actions τ=5 and τ=6 left, but actions up to τ=6.\n\nNow, y5 = 3 + U5 <= 3 + 3 =6\n\ny7=9.\n\ny7 = y5 + Δy5 + Δy6\n\nΔy5 and Δy6 are from actions at τ=5 and τ=6.\n\nEach +1 if U, 0 if S.\n\nSince y7=9, and y5 <=6, so we need Δy5 + Δy6 >=3, but each at most 1, so must both be U, and y5=6.\n\nBecause if y5=5, then need +4 in two steps, impossible; similarly if y5=6, need +3, impossible with two actions; Δy5 and Δy6 each max 1, so y7 <= y5 +2.\n\ny7 = y5 + Δy5 + Δy6 <= y5 + 2\n\nBut y7=9, so y5 >=7.\n\nBut earlier y5 <=6, contradiction.\n\ny5 <=6 from above, and y5 >=7 for y7=9 with two actions, impossible.\n\nTherefore, impossible with H=7.\n\nThus H=7 is not possible.\n\nTherefore minimal H is 8.\n\nWith H=8, we have U=6, S=2, D=0, for example.\n\nIn our sequence: actions U,U,U,S,S,U,U,U\n\nNow, let's write the actions for turns.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1=11.\n\nSo actions starting from turn t_1=11.\n\nSet τ=0 for turn 11.\n\nActions: at τ=0 (turn 11): U\n\nτ=1 (turn 12): U\n\nτ=2 (turn 13): U\n\nτ=3 (turn 14): S\n\nτ=4 (turn 15): S\n\nτ=5 (turn 16): U\n\nτ=6 (turn 17): U\n\nτ=7 (turn 18): U\n\nThen at τ=8, y=9, which is turn t_1 +8 =11+8=19.\n\nBut we don't care about the turn number, just the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to output actions for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nH=8, so from turn 11 to turn 18.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nNow, to confirm the positions:\n\nAt turn T=11 (τ=0), position (0,3)\n\nAction U: y=4 at T=12 (τ=1)\n\nAt T=12, position (0,4), action U: y=5 at T=13\n\nAt T=13, position (0,5), action U: y=6 at T=14\n\nAt T=14, position (0,6), action S: y=6 at T=15\n\nAt T=15, position (0,6), action S: y=6 at T=16\n\nAt T=16, position (0,6), action U: y=7 at T=17\n\nAt T=17, position (0,7), action U: y=8 at T=18\n\nAt T=18, position (0,8), action U: y=9 at T=19\n\nNow, collision check:\n\nAt each turn, position y_T, and if y_T between 1 and 8, check if cars cover x=0.\n\nT=11 (τ=0): y=3, freeway 3. Freeway 3 has car, but we computed no coverage at τ=0, safe.\n\nT=12 (τ=1): y=4, freeway 4, no coverage, safe.\n\nT=13 (τ=2): y=5, freeway 5, no coverage, safe.\n\nT=14 (τ=3): y=6, freeway 6, no coverage, safe.\n\nT=15 (τ=4): y=6, freeway 6, no coverage, safe. (row 7 and 8 have coverage but player not there)\n\nT=16 (τ=5): y=6, freeway 6, no coverage, safe.\n\nT=17 (τ=6): y=7, freeway 7. At τ=6, which is after 5, so no coverage? Coverage only at τ=4 and 5 for row 7. τ=6>5, so should be safe. Confirm: for freeway 7, cars cover at τ=4,5 only, so at τ=6, no car covers x=0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=18 (τ=7): y=8, freeway 8, at τ=7>5, no coverage, safe.\n\nThen T=19, y=9, goal.\n\nNo collisions.\n\nAnd H=8.\n\nWe could have different sequences, but this should be minimal.\n\nIn the S actions, we stayed at y=6 during τ=4 and τ=5 (turns T=15 and T=16).\n\nWe could have stayed at other rows, but y=6 is fine.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nActions for turns starting from t_1=11.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\) and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). The car positions and movements indicate that freeways 1 to 6 are always safe for \\(\\tau \\geq 0\\) (where \\(\\tau = T - t_1\\) and \\(T\\) is the turn number), as no cars cover \\(x = 0\\) at any \\(\\tau \\geq 0\\). Freeways 7 and 8 are unsafe at \\(\\tau = 4\\) and \\(\\tau = 5\\) (turns \\(T = 15\\) and \\(T = 16\\)) due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\), but safe at other times.\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 8, achieved with the following sequence of actions:\n- From the starting position \\(y = 3\\) at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 11), move up three times to reach \\(y = 6\\) by \\(\\tau = 3\\) (turn 14).\n- Stay at \\(y = 6\\) for turns \\(\\tau = 3\\) and \\(\\tau = 4\\) (turns 14 and 15) to avoid being on freeways 7 or 8 during the unsafe times \\(\\tau = 4\\) and \\(\\tau = 5\\) (turns 15 and 16).\n- After \\(\\tau = 5\\) (turn 16), move up three times to reach \\(y = 9\\) by \\(\\tau = 8\\) (turn 19).\n\nThis sequence uses 6 \"U\" actions and 2 \"S\" actions, ensuring no collisions:\n- At \\(\\tau = 4\\) and \\(\\tau = 5\\) (turns 15 and 16), the player is on \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6), which is safe.\n- Freeways 7 and 8 are only unsafe at \\(\\tau = 4\\) and \\(\\tau = 5\\), so moving to \\(y = 7\\) at \\(\\tau = 6\\) (turn 17) and \\(y = 8\\) at \\(\\tau = 7\\) (turn 18) is safe.\n\nThe actions for turns \\(t_1 = 11\\) to \\(t_1 + 7 = 18\\) are:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: S \\\\\nTurn 15: S \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1 = 12, and I'm at y=4.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For each car, I'm given its position at turn t1=12. The cars are on specific freeways, and they move left or right with a certain speed.\n\nThe collision rule: if I'm on a freeway y at turn T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that turn, I collide. But importantly, when I move to y_{T+1} at turn T, I'm not considered on y_{T+1} until the next turn. So at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I might move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nThe player position is updated at each turn based on the action: U for up (y+1), D for down (y-1), S for stay (y same). And y is always between 0 and 9.\n\nI start at y=4 at turn 12. I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns would be if I could go directly up, but I have to avoid cars on y=5 to y=8, since I'm going up from 4 to 9.\n\ny=4 is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to y=8. The grid has y=0 to y=9, and freeways are y=1 to y=8 where cars are. y=0 and y=9 might be safe, but I need to be at (0,9), which is the goal.\n\ny=9 has no cars, since freeways are only up to 8, so once I'm on y=9, I'm safe, I think. But I need to reach (0,9), and at that point, since there are no cars on y=9, no collision.\n\nBut when I move to y=9, at the turn I arrive, I'm on y=9, and since no cars, it should be fine.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe, but I start from y=4.\n\nNow, I need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal vertical moves: from 4 to 9, I need at least 5 up moves, but I can also stay or move down, so H could be more than 5 if I have to avoid cars.\n\nBut I should aim for H=5 if possible, with all U actions.\n\nBut I need to check for each step whether when I'm on a freeway, there is no car covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe player is always at x=0, I assume, since it says position (0, y_t), so x is fixed at 0, only y changes.\n\nAnd the cars are on the freeways, moving horizontally.\n\nSo for each freeway y, and at each turn, I need to check if at x=0, there is a car present.\n\nThe span is given, and it moves with speed s, left or right.\n\nDirection: left-moving or right-moving.\n\nIn the car state, it says direction: right or left? In the table, for freeway 1, it says \"right\", similarly for others.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed 12.\n\nDirection right: so it's moving right, meaning increasing x.\n\nThe span: for right-moving, at time t, span is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\nFor car on freeway i, at turn t1, head h, tail τ, speed s, direction.\n\nLeft-moving: at T > t1, span [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, decreasing x.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, head and tail: in the initial, for left-moving, head is greater than tail? I need to see the notation.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nNow, for right-moving, it says: span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAt t1, span should be [τ, h], since head and tail.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: head h=-48, tail τ=-59, so at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48], since right-moving, I assume head is the right end.\n\nThe problem says: for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, span at t1 [h, τ], and at T [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: head -48, tail -59, direction right. So since right-moving, tail should be left end, head right end, so span at t1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nNow, freeway 2: (24,13,right,6) — head 24, tail 13? But for right-moving, if head is 24, tail 13, that would be [13,24], head right.\n\nBut 13 to 24, and moving right.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 same as 2? Freeway 3: also (24,13,right,6), same as freeway 2? But different freeways, so different cars.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6 all have the same: (24,13,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7 has three cars: (24,13,right,6), (60,49,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8 same as 7: (24,13,right,6), (60,49,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nNow, I need to find when x=0 is covered for each freeway at each turn.\n\nSince the player is at x=0, and we care about whether 0 is in the span.\n\nAlso, for collision, only if I am on that freeway at that turn, and 0 in span.\n\nNow, I start at turn t1=12, position y=4.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe freeways I need to cross are y=5,6,7,8 to reach y=9 from y=4.\n\ny=4 is not a freeway, so no car there. Similarly, y=0 and y=9 no cars.\n\nWhen I am on a freeway, I need to ensure that at that turn, no car covers x=0.\n\nSince I move vertically, at each turn, I am on one y-level.\n\nFor example, at turn T, I am at y_T, and if y_T between 1 and 8, I need no car on freeway y_T covering x=0 at turn T.\n\nThen I choose action to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway and for each turn around t1=12, whether x=0 is covered.\n\nFirst, let's define the time relative to t1.\n\nSet t = 0 at current turn, so current turn is t=0, which is t1=12.\n\nSo at turn T from now, absolute time is t1 + T, but let's use T as offset.\n\nDefine τ = T - t1, so at τ=0, current time.\n\nFor a car, at time τ (relative), the span depends on direction.\n\nFor right-moving car: span at τ is [τ_init + s * τ, h_init + s * τ]\n\nAt τ=0, it should be [τ, h] as given.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving.\n\nIn this case, all cars are right-moving, I think? From the table, all say \"right\", so all moving right.\n\nFreeway 1: direction right, speed 12.\n\nFreeway 2 to 8 all right-moving.\n\nNo left-moving cars.\n\nSo all cars moving right, so span at time τ (since t1) is [τ_init + s τ, h_init + s τ]\n\nAnd x=0 is covered if 0 is in [low, high], i.e., low <= 0 <= high.\n\nNow for each freeway, let's list the cars and their spans.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, τ_init = -59, h_init = -48, s=12, direction right.\n\nSo at time τ, span: [ -59 + 12τ, -48 + 12τ ]\n\nx=0 covered if -59 + 12τ <= 0 <= -48 + 12τ\n\nSo -59 + 12τ <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 12τ\n\nFirst inequality: 12τ <= 59, τ <= 59/12 = 4.916, so τ <= 4 since turns integer? τ is integer, turns are discrete.\n\nτ is turn offset, integer.\n\nSimilarly, second: 0 <= -48 + 12τ, so 12τ >= 48, τ >= 4.\n\nSo τ >=4 and τ <=4.916, so since τ integer, τ=4.\n\nFor τ=4: low = -59 + 12*4 = -59 + 48 = -11\n\nHigh = -48 + 12*4 = -48 + 48 = 0\n\nSo [ -11, 0 ], so 0 is included, since <= high.\n\n0 <= 0 is true.\n\nSo at τ=4, x=0 covered.\n\nFor other τ, not covered.\n\nNow freeway 2: car (24,13,right,6)\n\nτ_init=13? Head and tail: in notation, it says (head, tail, dir, speed), but for right-moving, span at t1 is [tail, head]? Earlier for freeway 1, we had tail=-59, head=-48, so [ -59, -48 ]\n\nSimilarly here, head=24, tail=13, so at t1, [13,24]\n\ns=6\n\nAt time τ, span: [13 + 6τ, 24 + 6τ]\n\nx=0 covered if 13 + 6τ <= 0 <= 24 + 6τ\n\nBut 13 + 6τ <=0 implies 6τ <= -13, τ <= -13/6 ≈ -2.166, so τ <= -3 since integer? τ >=0 probably, but we need for future and past, but since we start from τ=0, and cars moving, we need to check for τ >=0.\n\n13 + 6τ <=0: since 13>0, 6τ <= -13, τ <= -13/6 = -2.166, so for τ <= -3, but τ=0,1,2,... so 13+6τ >=13>0, so never <=0. Similarly, 0 <=24+6τ always true for τ>=0.\n\nBut we need both: 13+6τ <=0 and 0<=24+6τ.\n\nSince 13+6τ >0 for τ>=0, first inequality false, so x=0 never covered for freeway 2 at any τ>=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, (24,13,right,6), same thing, x=0 never covered.\n\nFreeway 4: same.\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: same, all have only one car like that, and same.\n\nFreeway 6 has (24,13,right,6), same as above, so no coverage at x=0.\n\nNow freeway 7: has three cars.\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,6) — same as above, never covers x=0.\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,6) — head=60, tail=49, so at τ=0, [49,60], s=6\n\nAt τ, [49+6τ, 60+6τ]\n\nx=0 covered: 49+6τ <=0 <=60+6τ\n\n49+6τ <=0 implies 6τ <= -49, τ <= -49/6 ≈ -8.166, impossible for τ>=0.\n\n0<=60+6τ always true, but first false, so never covered.\n\nThird car: (-18,-29,right,6) — head=-18, tail=-29, so at τ=0, [τ, h] = [-29, -18], s=6\n\nAt τ, [-29 + 6τ, -18 + 6τ]\n\nx=0 covered if -29 + 6τ <= 0 <= -18 + 6τ\n\nSo -29 + 6τ <=0 and 0 <= -18 + 6τ\n\nFirst: 6τ <=29, τ <=29/6≈4.833, τ<=4\n\nSecond: 0 <= -18 + 6τ, so 6τ >=18, τ>=3\n\nSo τ>=3 and τ<=4.833, so τ=3 or 4.\n\nAt τ=3: low = -29 + 18 = -11, high = -18 + 18 =0, so [-11,0], 0 covered.\n\nAt τ=4: low = -29 + 24 = -5, high = -18 + 24 =6, so [-5,6], 0 covered.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nNow freeway 8: same as freeway 7, since same cars listed: (24,13,right,6), (60,49,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nSo for the third car, same as above, x=0 covered at τ=3 and τ=4.\n\nNow, freeway 1 has coverage only at τ=4.\n\nBut freeway 1 is y=1, which I might not be on, since I start at y=4.\n\nNow, I need to go through y=5 to y=8.\n\ny=5 and y=6: from above, freeway 2 to 6 have no cars covering x=0 at any time, since only one car each like (24,13) which is far right.\n\nFreeway 2: y=2, freeway 3: y=3, etc.\n\nLet's list freeways:\n\nFreeway k is for y=k, I assume.\n\nSo:\n\ny=1: car covers x=0 at τ=4\n\ny=2: no coverage\n\ny=3: no coverage (freeway 3 has same as y=2)\n\ny=4: but y=4 is not a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to y=8, but y=4 is a row, but it says freeways y=1 to 8 have cars, but y=4 might not have cars? In the table, freeway 1 to 8 are listed, but for y=4, it has cars?\n\nLook at the car state table:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\nFreeway 1: one car\n\nFreeway 2: one car (24,13,right,6)\n\nFreeway 3: one car (24,13,right,6) — but is this the same car or different? Different freeways, so different cars, but same parameters.\n\nFreeway 4: (24,13,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: (24,13,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: (24,13,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: three cars as above\n\nFreeway 8: three cars as above\n\nNow, for y=4: freeway 4 has a car with (24,13,right,6), which we said never covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly for y=5: freeway 5, same.\n\ny=6: freeway 6, same, no coverage.\n\ny=7: freeway 7, which has coverage at τ=3 and τ=4 from the third car.\n\ny=8: freeway 8, same, coverage at τ=3 and τ=4.\n\ny=1: coverage at τ=4.\n\nBut I start at y=4, which is not a freeway, so at τ=0, I'm at y=4, no issue.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe dangerous times are for y=7 and y=8 at τ=3 and 4, and y=1 at τ=4, but y=1 I might not visit.\n\nSince I'm going up from y=4, I will be on y=5,6,7,8 at some points.\n\ny=5: freeway 5, which has a car (24,13,right,6), but as computed, since [13+6τ,24+6τ] for τ>=0, min low is 13>0, so 0 not covered, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly y=6: freeway 6, same, always safe.\n\ny=7: freeway 7, has a car that covers x=0 at τ=3 and τ=4.\n\nSimilarly y=8: same at τ=3 and τ=4.\n\ny=4 is not freeway, safe.\n\ny=9 no freeway, safe.\n\nNow, τ is time offset from current turn.\n\nCurrent turn τ=0, I am at y=4.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some future turn.\n\nMinimal turns: if I go up every turn, I can reach in 5 turns: at τ=0, y=4; after U, τ=1, y=5; τ=2, y=6; τ=3, y=7; τ=4, y=8; τ=5, y=9.\n\nAt τ=5, y=9, which is safe.\n\nBut at τ=3, y=7, and freeway y=7 has car covering x=0 at τ=3, so if I am on y=7 at τ=3, I collide.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=4, if on y=7 or y=8, collide, but at τ=4, if I am on y=8, collide.\n\nIn the sequence: at τ=3, if I am at y=7, collide.\n\nIn the direct up path: at τ=3, y=7, and τ=3, so on freeway 7, x=0 covered, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=4, if I were on y=7 or y=8, but in this path, at τ=4, y=8, and τ=4, y=8 freeway has coverage, collision.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=7 at τ=3 or τ=4, and cannot be on y=8 at τ=3 or τ=4.\n\nAlso, y=1 at τ=4, but I'm not going there.\n\nSo for y=7 and y=8, unsafe at τ=3 and τ=4.\n\nNow, τ=3 and τ=4 are turns 3 and 4 from now.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=7 at τ=3 or τ=4, and avoid y=8 at τ=3 or τ=4.\n\nNow, I start at y=4 at τ=0.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nI could delay going up or something.\n\nSince y=5 and y=6 are always safe, I can stay there or move.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H is at least 5, but with direct up, I collide at τ=3.\n\nSo I need to take more turns or change the path.\n\nFor example, I could stay at y=4 for some turns, but y=4 is not freeway, so safe, but I need to go up eventually.\n\ny=4 is safe since no cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 to y=9, only y=1 to 8 have cars, but y=4 is a row, but in the context, since it's not listed as freeway, I think no cars, so safe.\n\nThe freeways are specifically y=1 to 8 with cars.\n\ny=4 is not a freeway? But in the grid, y=4 is a row, but the car state table lists freeway k for k=1 to 8, so for each y from 1 to 8, there might be cars.\n\nBut for y=4, freeway 4 has a car: (24,13,right,6), but as computed, it doesn't cover x=0, so even if I am on y=4, since freeway 4 has cars, but at x=0 not covered, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly for other y.\n\nBut for y=4, at any time, since no car covers x=0, it is safe to be there.\n\nSimilarly y=5 and y=6 safe.\n\ny=7 and y=8 unsafe at τ=3 and τ=4.\n\nτ=3 and τ=4 are specific turns.\n\nNow, the unsafe times for y=7 and y=8 are only at τ=3 and τ=4.\n\nBefore or after, safe.\n\nFor example, at τ=2, y=7: at τ=2, for freeway 7, the car: for the third car, at τ=2, low = -29 + 6*2 = -29+12= -17, high= -18+12= -6, so [-17,-6], 0 not in, since -6 <0? -6 <=0 but 0 not <= -6? 0 > -6, so not in [-17,-6], since -17 <= x <= -6, 0 > -6, so not covered.\n\nSimilarly at τ=5: low = -29 + 30 =1, high= -18+30=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for other cars on y=7, no coverage.\n\nSo y=7 safe except τ=3 and τ=4.\n\nSimilarly y=8 same.\n\nNow, I need to cross y=7 and y=8 when not unsafe.\n\nBut I have to go through them sequentially.\n\nI start at y=4, τ=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe direct path has problem at τ=3 y=7 and τ=4 y=8.\n\nI could, for example, stay at y=6 for a while.\n\nSince y=5 and y=6 safe, I can stay there.\n\nThen go up later.\n\nFor instance, at τ=0, I am at y=4.\n\nI can choose to go up or not.\n\nIf I go up at τ=0 to y=5.\n\nThen at τ=1, at y=5.\n\ny=5 safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, I can go to y=6.\n\nAt τ=2, at y=6, safe.\n\nNow at τ=2, if I go up to y=7, but at τ=3, I would be at y=7, which is unsafe τ=3.\n\nIf I stay at y=6 at τ=2, then at τ=3, I am still at y=6, safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, I can go to y=7, but at τ=3, if I go to y=7, I am moving at τ=3: at turn τ=3, I am at y=6, and I choose action to go to y=7 for next turn.\n\nImportant point: when I move vertically, at turn T, I am on y_T, and after action, I move to y_{T+1} at the beginning of next turn.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T for y_T.\n\nIf I am on y_T at turn T, and if y_T is freeway and car covers x=0, collision.\n\nNow, when I decide to move to y_{T+1} at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1.\n\nSo for example, at turn τ=3, if I am on y=6, and I choose U, then at τ=3 I am on y=6, which is safe, and I move to y=7 at the end of turn, so at turn τ=3, I am not on y=7, so no collision with y=7 cars at τ=3.\n\nThen at turn τ=4, I am on y=7, and if at τ=4, y=7 has car covering x=0, then collision.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn this case, for y=7, unsafe at τ=3 and τ=4.\n\nIf I am on y=7 at turn τ=3, collision if covered.\n\nOr at τ=4, on y=7, collision.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nBack to the plan.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=7 at τ=3 or τ=4, and on y=8 at τ=3 or τ=4.\n\nSince τ=3 and τ=4 are consecutive, I can be on y=7 before or after.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, y=7 and y=8 both unsafe at same times, so I need to cross them at different times.\n\nFor example, I can be on y=7 at τ=2 or τ=5, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at τ=2 or τ=5, etc.\n\nτ=2: at τ=2, y=7 safe, as computed.\n\nτ=5: safe.\n\nNow, since I have to go from below to above, I need to visit y=7 then y=8.\n\nI can, for example, go to y=7 at τ=2, then to y=8 at τ=3, but at τ=3, if on y=8, unsafe.\n\nIf I go to y=7 at τ=2, then at τ=2 I am on y=7, safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, I choose action to go to y=8 for τ=3.\n\nThen at τ=3, I am on y=8.\n\nBut at τ=3, y=8 unsafe, since coverage, so collision.\n\nIf I stay on y=7 at τ=2, then at τ=3 I am still on y=7, which is unsafe at τ=3.\n\nProblem.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=7 or y=8 during τ=3 or τ=4.\n\nTherefore, I must be on y=7 at some τ not 3 or 4, and similarly for y=8.\n\nThe safe times for y=7 are τ <=2 or τ>=5.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nBut since I need to go through them in order, and I start from below.\n\nI am at y=4 at τ=0.\n\nI can go to y=5 at τ=1, y=6 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, I am at y=6.\n\nNow, if I go up to y=7 at τ=3, but at τ=3 I would be on y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at y=6 at τ=2, then at τ=3 I am at y=6, safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, I can go to y=7, but at τ=3, I am on y=6, and after action, I move to y=7 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, I am on y=7.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=7 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf at τ=3, I stay at y=6, then at τ=4, I am at y=6.\n\nThen at τ=4, I can go to y=7, then at τ=5 I am on y=7.\n\nNow at τ=5, y=7 safe, as earlier.\n\nThen from there, I can go to y=8 at τ=6, on y=8 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, y=8 safe? Earlier, at τ=5: for y=8, similar to y=7, at τ=5, low = -29 + 6*5 = -29+30=1, high= -18+30=12, [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly at τ=6, low=-29+36=7, high=-18+36=18, [7,18], safe.\n\nThen to y=9.\n\nBut this takes more turns.\n\nLet's list the turns.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=4\n\nI need actions from τ=0 onwards.\n\nSuppose I do:\n\nAt τ=0: I can do S or U or D, but D to y=3, which is freeway, but y=3 safe always, as freeway 3 has no coverage, so y=3 safe, but I need to go up, so probably not down.\n\nSimilarly, I can stay or go up.\n\nTo save time, go up.\n\nBut to avoid the unsafe times, I need to delay.\n\nSo at τ=0: go U, to y=5\n\nThen at τ=1: at y=5, I can go U to y=6\n\nτ=1: after action, y=6\n\nAt τ=1, I am at y=5, and choose action.\n\nSet the sequence.\n\nTurn relative τ, position at start of turn.\n\nAt τ=0: position y=4\n\nI choose action a_{t1 + τ} for this turn.\n\nAfter action, position for next turn.\n\nStandard: at turn T, I am at position, choose action, then position updates for T+1.\n\nSo at turn τ (relative), position y_τ.\n\nAfter action, y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy.\n\nAt turn τ, I am on y_τ, collision check.\n\nThen I choose action for this turn, which determines y_{τ+1}.\n\nFor τ=0: y=4, not freeway, safe. I choose action, say U, so y_{1} =5\n\nτ=1: at y=5, which is freeway 5, but safe as no coverage. I choose action, say U, so y_{2} =6\n\nτ=2: at y=6, freeway 6, safe. I choose action.\n\nIf I choose U, then y_{3} =7, so at τ=3, I will be at y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nIf I choose S, then y_{3} =6, so at τ=3, I am at y=6, safe.\n\nThen at τ=3: at y=6, I choose action.\n\nIf I choose U, then y_{4} =7, so at τ=4, I am at y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf I choose S, y_{4} =6, then at τ=4, at y=6.\n\nThen at τ=4: at y=6, I choose U, then y_{5} =7, so at τ=5, at y=7.\n\nτ=5: at y=7, now τ=5, which is safe for y=7, as earlier.\n\nThen I choose U, y_{6} =8\n\nτ=6: at y=8, τ=6, safe? For y=8, at τ=6: similar to y=7, the car that was problematic: for freeway 8, third car, at τ=6, [ -29 + 36, -18 + 36] = [7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at τ=6, I choose U, y_{7} =9\n\nτ=7: at y=9, which is not freeway, safe, and I am at (0,9), done.\n\nBut I reached at τ=7, so H=8 turns? Let's see.\n\nTurns from τ=0 to τ=7, but I reach y=9 at τ=7.\n\nThe number of turns: from start to end.\n\nAt τ=0, I start at y=4.\n\nAfter H turns, I am at y_{t1 + H} or something.\n\nDefine: at turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, I perform actions, and after H actions, I am at position after turn t1 + H -1.\n\nThe problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that after H actions, at turn t1 + H, position is (0,9)? No.\n\nLet's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nIn the player update: after action at t, position at t+1.\n\nSo at time t, position y_t, choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nStart at t1, y_{t1} =4.\n\nAfter actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1 + H -1}, we have y_{t1 + H} = ? \n\nAfter H actions, the position is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9? But the problem says \"y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nQuote: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\n\"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, so after a_{t1 + H -1}, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9? Inconsistency.\n\nRead carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9 means at time t1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nThen the actions are from t=0 to H-1, which correspond to times t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nAt time t1 + t for t=0, action a_{t1+0} determines y_{t1+1}\n\nAfter action at time t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo at time t1, y_{t1} =4 (given)\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} is set.\n\nAfter action a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2} set.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H -1}, y_{t1 + H} is set.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9? That would be the position before the last action or something.\n\nI think there's confusion.\n\nFrom the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nNow, y_{t1 + H -1} is the position at time t1 + H -1.\n\nThe actions are performed at times t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nAt each time t from t1 to t1 + H -1, we perform action a_t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At time t, position y_t, perform a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy\n\n- So y_{t+1} depends on a_t.\n\nWe start with y_{t1} given.\n\nAfter performing a_{t1}, we have y_{t1+1}\n\nAfter a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2}, etc.\n\nAfter performing the last action a_{t1 + H -1}, we have y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9, which is the position before performing the action at time t1 + H -1.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is set by the previous actions, before a_{t1 + H -1} is performed.\n\nThen at time t1 + H -1, we perform a_{t1 + H -1}, which would set y_{t1 + H}, but we don't care as long as y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nTo have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, we need to reach position 9 at time t1 + H -1.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1 (relative) should bring us to y=9 at time t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then actions {a_{t1}}, and we want y_{t1} =9, but at start y_{t1}=4, so impossible unless H>1.\n\nWith H actions, we control y_{t1+1} to y_{t1 + H}.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is controlled by the first H-1 actions? Let's index.\n\nSet t from 0 to H-1 for actions.\n\nAt time t1 + k for k=0 to H-1, perform action a_{t1+k}, which sets y_{t1+k+1}.\n\nPosition at time t1+k is y_{t1+k}, for k=0,1,2,...,H-1.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + (H-1)} =9.\n\nThat is, at time t1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nThe actions a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2} affect y_{t1+1} to y_{t1 + H -1}, and a_{t1 + H -1} affects y_{t1 + H}, but since we only care about y at t1+H-1, we may not need the last action, or it could be anything, but we have to specify H actions.\n\nSince we reach at t1+H-1, the action at that time might not matter, but we need to specify the sequence.\n\nFor the position to be 9 at time t1+H-1, it means that after H-1 actions from t1, we are at y=9 at time t1+H-1.\n\nThen we perform a_{t1+H-1}, which might change y, but since we are already at (0,9), and we need to be there at t1+H-1, the action a_{t1+H-1} could be S to stay, or whatever, but to minimize H, probably we stop when we reach.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to specify H actions.\n\nPerhaps for the turn when we reach, we don't need to move, but we have to include the action.\n\nTo have y_{t1+H-1} =9, it means that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9, and we perform some action, but since we are at goal, action could be S.\n\nBut in terms of reaching, as long as at some turn position is 9.\n\nNow back to the path.\n\nI want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMinimal H if no cars: from y=4 to y=9, need 5 up moves, so at time t1+5, y=9 if all U.\n\nBut with cars, we saw that at t1+3, if y=7, collision, etc.\n\nIn relative time, I want y_τ =9 at some τ.\n\nBut τ is offset.\n\nSet τ such that at absolute time, turn t.\n\nBut let's use relative τ from current.\n\nAt τ=0 (time t1), y=4\n\nI want y_τ =9 for some τ, with minimal τ.\n\nSince each up move increases y by 1, minimal τ is 5, to y=9 at τ=5.\n\nBut at τ=3, if y=7, collision; at τ=4, if y=8, collision, etc.\n\nIn the direct up: at τ=0, y=4, action U, so y1=5\n\nτ=1, y=5, action U, y2=6\n\nτ=2, y=6, action U, y3=7\n\nBut at τ=3, y=7, which is unsafe if τ=3.\n\nIn this case τ=3.\n\nSimilarly, if I continue, at τ=3, action U, y4=8, at τ=4, y=8, unsafe if τ=4.\n\nSo collision.\n\nTo avoid, I need that when τ=3, I am not on y=7, and when τ=4, not on y=7 or y=8.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 unsafe at both τ=3 and τ=4.\n\nSo for τ=3, I should be on y<=6 or y=9, but y=9 not yet.\n\nSimilarly τ=4, on y<=6 or y=9.\n\nThen at some point I go to y=7 and y=8 at safe times.\n\nSafe times for y=7: τ<=2 or τ>=5\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, I am at y=4 at τ=0.\n\nI can go to y=5 at τ=1 (by U at τ=0)\n\nThen to y=6 at τ=2 (U at τ=1)\n\nNow at τ=2, y=6.\n\nIf I go U at τ=2, I go to y=7 at τ=3, unsafe.\n\nSo instead, I can stay at y=6 for one turn.\n\nAt τ=2, choose S, so y3=6, so at τ=3, y=6.\n\nThen at τ=3, I am at y=6, safe.\n\nNow, I can go to y=7 at τ=4? But if I choose U at τ=3, then y4=7, so at τ=4, y=7, which is unsafe (τ=4).\n\nIf I choose to stay again at τ=3, S, then y4=6, at τ=4, y=6.\n\nThen at τ=4, choose U, to y5=7, at τ=5, y=7.\n\nτ=5 is safe for y=7.\n\nThen at τ=5, choose U, to y6=8, at τ=6, y=8.\n\nNow τ=6, safe for y=8.\n\nThen at τ=6, choose U, to y7=9, at τ=7, y=9.\n\nSo I reach y=9 at τ=7.\n\nH-1 =7? Let's see the time.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt relative time τ, y_τ = position at time t1 + τ.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for τ = H-1, y_{t1 + H-1} =9.\n\nIn this case, at τ=7, y=9, so H-1=7, so H=8.\n\nActions from t=0 to 7? t from 0 to H-1.\n\nH actions.\n\nSequence: actions at τ=0 to τ=6 to reach y=9 at τ=7.\n\ny at τ=7 is set by action at τ=6.\n\nList:\n\nAt time τ=0 (t1): position y=4, choose action. To go to y=5, choose U.\n\nThen y at τ=1 is 5.\n\nAt τ=1: position y=5, choose U, to y=6 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2: position y=6, choose S (stay), so y at τ=3 is 6.\n\nAt τ=3: position y=6, choose S, so y at τ=4 is 6.\n\nAt τ=4: position y=6, choose U, to y=7 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5: position y=7, choose U, to y=8 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6: position y=8, choose U, to y=9 at τ=7.\n\nNow, at τ=7, y=9, which is what we want for y_{t1 + H -1} if H-1=7, so H=8.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} = y_{t1 +7} when H=8.\n\nAnd we have actions from τ=0 to τ=7? H actions, τ from 0 to H-1=7.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at times t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nHere, at τ=7, we need to specify an action, but since we are at y=8, we choose U to go to y=9, which happens at τ=8, but we don't care about τ=8.\n\nWe want position at τ=7 to be 9.\n\nIn the above, at τ=7, position is y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, at τ=6 (time t1+6), we are at y=8, we choose U, so that at time t1+7, y=9.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so if H-1=7, then t1 + H -1 = t1+7, so y=9.\n\nThen H=8.\n\nBut at τ=7 (t1+7), we also perform an action, but since we are at y=9, we can choose S or whatever, but in this case, to reach at τ=7, we need the action at τ=6 to be U from y=8.\n\nThen at τ=7, we are at y=9, and we might need to specify action for τ=7, but since we have H actions including up to τ=H-1, and for τ=7, action could be S to stay at y=9.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we have actions from τ=0 to τ=6 to reach y=9 at τ=7.\n\nNumber of actions: from τ=0 to τ=6, that's 7 actions? τ=0,1,2,3,4,5,6: 7 actions.\n\nH actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, the position is set for time t1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at time t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nSo for position at time t1 + k to be 9, we need the actions up to k-1 to have been performed.\n\nSpecifically, to have y_{t1 + m} =9, it is determined by the actions up to time t1 + m -1.\n\nFor example, to have y_{t1} =9, no action needed, but given 4.\n\nTo have y_{t1+1} =9, need action at t1 to be U if y=8, etc.\n\nIn general, to have y_{t1 + k} =9 for some k.\n\nThen the actions from t1 to t1 + k -1 affect it.\n\nThen for y_{t1 + k} =9, we need k actions from t1 to t1+k-1.\n\nThen y_{t1 + k} =9.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so set k = H-1, then y_{t1 + H -1} =9, with actions from t1 to t1 + (H-1) -1 = t1 to t1 + H-2.\n\nThen we have H-1 actions? Messy.\n\nLet's define K such that at time t1 + K, position is 9.\n\nThen to achieve that, we need K actions if K>0, from time t1 to t1+K-1.\n\nThen the number of turns H should be such that t1 + H -1 = t1 + K, so H-1 = K, thus H = K+1.\n\nAnd the sequence has H actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor example, to reach at time t1 + K, with K=5, H=6 actions.\n\nIn the car problem, to reach y=9 at τ=5 with all U, but not possible due to cars.\n\nIn our case, with detour, we reached at τ=7, so K=7, H=8.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nFor example, can I reach earlier than τ=7?\n\nMinimal K is 5, but not possible.\n\nK=6: reach at τ=6.\n\nTo have y=9 at τ=6, I need to be at y=8 at τ=5, and choose U at τ=5.\n\nBut at τ=5, if I am at y=8, is it safe?\n\ny=8 at τ=5: freeway 8, at τ=5, for the car, low = -29 + 6*5 = -29+30=1, high= -18+30=12, [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, I need to be at y=8 at τ=5.\n\nTo be at y=8 at τ=5, I need to be at y=7 at τ=4 and choose U at τ=4, but at τ=4, if I am at y=7, it is unsafe, since coverage at τ=4.\n\nIf I can be at y=7 at τ=2, for example.\n\nLet's see the timeline.\n\nI start τ=0, y=4.\n\nTo reach y=9 at τ=6, I need to be at y=8 at τ=5.\n\nTo be at y=8 at τ=5, I need to be at y=7 at τ=4 and choose U at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, if on y=7, unsafe.\n\nTo be at y=7 at τ=4, I need to be at y=6 at τ=3 and choose U at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, on y=6, safe, but then U to y=7 at τ=4.\n\nThen at τ=4, on y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf I can be at y=7 earlier.\n\nFor example, at τ=2, I can be at y=7.\n\nHow? From τ=0, y=4, U to y=5 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, U to y=6 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, U to y=7 at τ=3? If U at τ=2, to y=7 at τ=3.\n\nBut at τ=3, on y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf I go faster: but I can only move one step per turn.\n\nAt τ=0, U to y=5.\n\nτ=1, U to y=6.\n\nτ=2, if U to y=7 at τ=3, unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nAt τ=0, I could go down, but that might take more time.\n\nFor example, go to y=3 or something, but y=3 is freeway but safe, but going down increases time.\n\nNot better.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=7 at τ=5 directly from y=6.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at τ=5, I need to be at y=6 at τ=4 and choose U at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, on y=6, safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at τ=5.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=6 at τ=4, I need to be at y=5 at τ=3 and choose U at τ=3, or stay, etc.\n\nBut let's aim for y=9 at τ=6.\n\ny=9 at τ=6 requires y=8 at τ=5 with U action at τ=5.\n\ny=8 at τ=5 safe.\n\nTo have y=8 at τ=5, need y=7 at τ=4 with U at τ=4.\n\nBut y=7 at τ=4 unsafe.\n\nCannot have y=7 at τ=4.\n\nIf I can have y=8 at τ=5 without being on y=7 at τ=4.\n\nBut I have to be on y=7 before y=8.\n\nUnless I jump, but no, only adjacent moves.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=8 at τ=5 without being on y=7 at τ=4 or earlier.\n\nSpecifically, to be at y=8 at time τ=5, I must have been at y=7 at time τ=4 and chosen U at τ=4, so that at τ=5, y=8.\n\nBut at τ=4, when I am on y=7 to choose the action, I am on y=7 at τ=4, which is unsafe.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be on y=8 at τ=5 because it requires me to be on y=7 at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, for any sequence, I cannot be on y=7 or y=8 at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=3, I cannot be on y=7.\n\nNow for y=9 at τ=6, it requires y=8 at τ=5, which requires being on y=7 at τ=4, impossible.\n\nTherefore, I cannot reach y=9 at τ=6 or earlier with the unsafe times.\n\nThe earliest possible is after τ=4.\n\nSo at τ=5, I can be on y=7, safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at τ=6, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at τ=7.\n\nSo reach at τ=7, with actions as before.\n\nI could reach at τ=7 with different sequence, but same time.\n\nIs there a way to reach at τ=7 without waiting?\n\nFor example, if I go down first, but that might take longer.\n\nSuppose at τ=0, I go down to y=3.\n\nBut y=3 is freeway, but safe, as no coverage.\n\nAt τ=0, action D, so y1=3 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=3, I can go U to y=4 at τ=2, or something, but not efficient.\n\nFor example, to go to y=3 at τ=1, then to y=4 at τ=2, then to y=5 at τ=3, etc., but it takes more turns to go back, so reaching later than τ=7.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo minimal to reach at τ=7.\n\nH-1=7, so H=8.\n\nNow, sequence of actions.\n\nFrom above:\n\nAt turn t1 (τ=0): action U, to y=5\n\nTurn t1+1 (τ=1): action U, to y=6\n\nTurn t1+2 (τ=2): action S, to y=6 (stay, so y=6 at τ=3)\n\nAt τ=2, position y=6, choose S, so y at τ=3 is 6.\n\nTurn t1+3 (τ=3): position y=6, choose S, to y=6 at τ=4\n\nTurn t1+4 (τ=4): position y=6, choose U, to y=7 at τ=5\n\nTurn t1+5 (τ=5): position y=7, choose U, to y=8 at τ=6\n\nTurn t1+6 (τ=6): position y=8, choose U, to y=9 at τ=7\n\nAt τ=7, y=9, which is t1+7.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so t1 + H -1 = t1 +7, thus H-1=7, H=8.\n\nActions from t=0 to 7: 8 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t1+7 (τ=7), we are at y=9, and we need to specify an action, but since we are at goal, we can choose S.\n\nIn the sequence above, the last action is at τ=6 to go to y=9 at τ=7.\n\nThen at τ=7, we perform an action, say S, to stay at y=9.\n\nBut position at τ=7 is already 9, so we don't need to move.\n\nBut for the sequence, we need H actions including up to when we reach.\n\nSince we reach at time t1+7, which is the position after actions up to t1+6.\n\ny_{t1+7} is set by action at t1+6.\n\nThen at time t1+7, we are at y=9, and we can choose action for that turn, but it doesn't change the position for that time.\n\nIn the requirement, we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9, and actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor H=8, t1 + H -1 = t1 +7, so we need y_{t1+7} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, with actions:\n\n- At t1+0: U, set y_{t1+1}=5\n\n- t1+1: U, set y_{t1+2}=6\n\n- t1+2: S, set y_{t1+3}=6\n\n- t1+3: S, set y_{t1+4}=6\n\n- t1+4: U, set y_{t1+5}=7\n\n- t1+5: U, set y_{t1+6}=8\n\n- t1+6: U, set y_{t1+7}=9\n\nSo y_{t1+7}=9, which is what we want for H=8, since t1 + H -1 = t1+7.\n\nThen we have actions from t=0 to 6, that's 7 actions? t from 0 to H-1=7? H=8, t=0 to 7.\n\nI have actions up to t1+6, which is t=6.\n\nMissing the action at t1+7.\n\nAt time t1+7, we need to specify action a_{t1+7}.\n\nSince we are at y=9 at time t1+7, we can choose S, so that y_{t1+8}=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to include it for H=8 actions.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t1+0: U\n\nTurn t1+1: U\n\nTurn t1+2: S\n\nTurn t1+3: S\n\nTurn t1+4: U\n\nTurn t1+5: U\n\nTurn t1+6: U\n\nTurn t1+7: S  (since at y=9)\n\nAnd y_{t1+7}=9.\n\nIn the action at t1+6, we set y_{t1+7}=9, so at time t1+7, position is 9.\n\nThen at time t1+7, we choose S to stay.\n\nBut in the sequence, it's fine.\n\nTo save an action, but H is the number to reach, so we need to include until we are at goal.\n\nSince we reach at t1+7, H-1=7, H=8.\n\nNow, but in the sequence above, at t1+2 and t1+3, we stayed at y=6 to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nBut is there a way with less waiting?\n\nFor example, at τ=2, instead of staying, I could go to y=7 at τ=3? But unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=7 at τ=5 directly without staying twice.\n\nAnother sequence: at τ=0: U to y=5\n\nτ=1: U to y=6\n\nτ=2: S to y=6 (stay at τ=3)\n\nBut at τ=3, instead of staying again, I could go to y=7 at τ=4? But unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nAt τ=0, I could do S first, stay at y=4.\n\nThen at τ=1: U to y=5\n\nτ=2: U to y=6\n\nτ=3: S to y=6 (since at τ=3, if U, to y=7 at τ=4, unsafe)\n\nThen τ=4: U to y=7 at τ=5\n\nτ=5: U to y=8 at τ=6\n\nτ=6: U to y=9 at τ=7\n\nSame as before, but I stayed at y=4 instead of moving, so I reach at same time τ=7.\n\nBut I used an extra stay at beginning, not better.\n\nIn the first sequence, I moved up immediately.\n\nIn the sequence I have, with two stays at y=6.\n\nBut I could have only one stay if I time differently.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=6 later.\n\nAt τ=0: S, stay at y=4\n\nτ=1: U to y=5\n\nτ=2: U to y=6\n\nτ=3: now at y=6, I can S to y=6 at τ=4\n\nThen τ=4: U to y=7 at τ=5\n\nτ=5: U to y=8 at τ=6\n\nτ=6: U to y=9 at τ=7\n\nSame, but I stayed at y=4 instead of moving.\n\nWorse because I delayed the first move.\n\nBetter to go up first to y=5 and y=6 quickly.\n\nThen wait at y=6 for two turns to skip the unsafe times.\n\nSince unsafe at τ=3 and τ=4, I need to be not on y=7 or y=8 during those turns.\n\nBy waiting at y=6 until τ=4, then at τ=4 I go to y=7 at τ=5.\n\nIn the action, at τ=4 I choose U, so at τ=5 I am at y=7.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nI think H=8 is minimal.\n\nNow, about the cars: I think I covered all.\n\ny=1 at τ=4, but I am not on y=1.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways no issue.\n\nIn the sequence, for freeway 7 and 8, I am on y=7 at τ=5, which is safe, and y=8 at τ=6, safe.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nCurrent turn t1=12.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S  (but at turn 19, position is y=9, so S is fine)\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 18: action U, which sets y at turn 19 to 9.\n\nThen at turn 19, we are at y=9, and we choose S to stay.\n\nBut since we reach at turn 19, and H-1 corresponds to turn 19 when H=8, t1 + H -1 =12+8-1=19, yes.\n\nTo avoid the extra action, but I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can have only 7 actions if we reach at turn 18 or something.\n\nSuppose I want y at turn t1+6=18 to be 9.\n\nThen I need to be at y=8 at turn 17 with U action at turn 17.\n\ny=8 at turn 17, which is τ=5 (since τ=0 at t1=12, turn 17 is t1+5, τ=5)\n\nAt τ=5, y=8, is safe? Yes, as before.\n\nTo be at y=8 at τ=5, need to be at y=7 at τ=4 with U at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, on y=7, unsafe.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSimilarly, cannot reach before τ=7.\n\nSo H=8 is minimal.\n\nNow, the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, it should list the actions.\n\nAlso, for the stays, I used S at turn 14 and 15.\n\nBut in the car state, for y=6, freeway 6, it is always safe, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, I think this is the way.\n\nSo minimal H=8.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nCurrent turn t1=12.\n\nActions at turn t1 + t for t=0 to 7.\n\nt=0: turn 12, action U\n\nt=1: turn 13, action U\n\nt=2: turn 14, action S\n\nt=3: turn 15, action S\n\nt=4: turn 16, action U\n\nt=5: turn 17, action U\n\nt=6: turn 18, action U\n\nt=7: turn 19, action S\n\nAnd position at turn 19 (t1+7) is 9.\n\nYes.\n\nTo write in the format.\n\nIn the action at turn 18, U, from y=8 to y=9, so at turn 19, y=9.\n\nThen at turn 19, S.\n\nBut we could have at turn 18, if we were already at y=9, but we weren't.\n\nIn this sequence, we reach at turn 19.\n\nI think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) is 8, considering the need to avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe unsafe times for freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are at relative turns \\(\\tau = 3\\) and \\(\\tau = 4\\) (where \\(\\tau = 0\\) corresponds to turn 12). Specifically:\n- On \\(y = 7\\), collisions occur at \\(\\tau = 3\\) and \\(\\tau = 4\\) due to a car covering \\(x = 0\\).\n- On \\(y = 8\\), collisions occur at \\(\\tau = 3\\) and \\(\\tau = 4\\) due to a car covering \\(x = 0\\).\n\nTo avoid these collisions, the player must not be on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at \\(\\tau = 3\\) or \\(\\tau = 4\\). The safe times to be on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) are \\(\\tau \\leq 2\\) or \\(\\tau \\geq 5\\).\n\nThe sequence is designed to:\n- Move up to \\(y = 6\\) quickly by turn 14 (\\(\\tau = 2\\)).\n- Stay at \\(y = 6\\) for turns 14 and 15 (\\(\\tau = 2\\) and \\(\\tau = 3\\)) to avoid being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) during \\(\\tau = 3\\) and \\(\\tau = 4\\).\n- Move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 16 (\\(\\tau = 4\\), arriving at \\(\\tau = 5\\)) when \\(y = 7\\) is safe.\n- Move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 17 (\\(\\tau = 5\\), arriving at \\(\\tau = 6\\)) when \\(y = 8\\) is safe.\n- Move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 18 (\\(\\tau = 6\\), arriving at \\(\\tau = 7\\)).\n- At turn 19 (\\(\\tau = 7\\)), the player is at \\(y = 9\\), and the action is \"S\" to stay, as the goal is reached.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 12 (\\(\\tau = 0\\)): Action \"U\" moves the player to \\(y = 5\\). Position at turn 13 is \\((0, 5)\\). Freeway \\(y = 5\\) is safe at all times (no car covers \\(x = 0\\)).\n- At turn 13 (\\(\\tau = 1\\)): Action \"U\" moves the player to \\(y = 6\\). Position at turn 14 is \\((0, 6)\\). Freeway \\(y = 6\\) is safe at all times (no car covers \\(x = 0\\)).\n- At turn 14 (\\(\\tau = 2\\)): Action \"S\" keeps the player at \\(y = 6\\). Position at turn 15 is \\((0, 6)\\). Safe.\n- At turn 15 (\\(\\tau = 3\\)): Action \"S\" keeps the player at \\(y = 6\\). Position at turn 16 is \\((0, 6)\\). Safe, and avoids being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at \\(\\tau = 3\\).\n- At turn 16 (\\(\\tau = 4\\)): Action \"U\" moves the player to \\(y = 7\\). Position at turn 17 is \\((0, 7)\\). At \\(\\tau = 5\\) (turn 17), \\(y = 7\\) is safe (car spans do not cover \\(x = 0\\)).\n- At turn 17 (\\(\\tau = 5\\)): Action \"U\" moves the player to \\(y = 8\\). Position at turn 18 is \\((0, 8)\\). At \\(\\tau = 6\\) (turn 18), \\(y = 8\\) is safe (car spans do not cover \\(x = 0\\)).\n- At turn 18 (\\(\\tau = 6\\)): Action \"U\" moves the player to \\(y = 9\\).

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 5) at turn t_1 = 13. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where there's a car such that 0 (the x-coordinate) is in the car's span at that exact turn. Importantly, when moving to a new row, the player isn't on that row until the next turn. So for a move at turn T, y_{T+1} is the new row, but at turn T, the player is still on y_T.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states. For each freeway, there are cars with head, tail, direction, and speed. The direction tells us if it's left-moving or right-moving. From the update:\n\n- Left-moving: span moves left as time increases.\n\n- Right-moving: span moves right as time increases.\n\nIn the table:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nDirection is right, so it's right-moving. Head is -36, tail is -47? That seems odd because for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, I think. Let me read the span definition.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" and it says [τ, h] for initial, but in the car state, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed). For freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 12). But for right-moving, head should be the front, so if it's moving right, head should be larger than tail? Here head is -36 and tail is -47, which is larger since -36 > -47, so head = -36, tail = -47, so span is [tail, head] = [-47, -36], I think? But the notation says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, span is [τ, h], so [tail, head].\n\nIn the update rule: for right-moving, \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nSimilarly for left: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, dir, speed).\n\nFor freeway 1: head = -36, tail = -47, dir = right, speed = 12.\n\nSince dir is right, span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [tail, head] = [-47, -36].\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-47 + 12(T-13), -36 + 12(T-13)]\n\nt_1 is 13, so at time T, span is [-47 + 12(T-13), -36 + 12(T-13)]\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, player is on freeway k, and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at T.\n\nPlayer position at T is y_T, so if y_T = k for some k=1 to 8, and 0 is in car's span on row k at T.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=5 at t=13.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nSince we can only change y by at most 1 per turn, minimal turns to go from 5 to 9 is 4 turns if we go up each time, but we have to avoid cars on rows 1-8.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway, I think? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars. So reaching y=9 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is safe, but we start at y=5, need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut we might need to go down or stay to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when a car has 0 in its span at a given turn.\n\nt_1 = 13 is the current turn.\n\nWe need to find actions from t=13 onwards.\n\nLet t be the turn number, with t=13 being the start.\n\nPlayer y_t at t=13 is 5.\n\nWe need to reach y_{t+H-1} = 9 for some H, with minimal H.\n\nThe sequence is from t=13 to t=13+H-1, so after H turns, we are at turn 13+H-1 with y=9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, we need to be at y=9 at t=13, but we are at y=5, impossible. Minimal H without cars is 4, going up each turn: at t=13, y=5; t=14, y=6; t=15, y=7; t=16, y=8; t=17, y=9. So at t=17, y=9, so H=5? Let's see the turns.\n\nStart at t=13, position (0,5).\n\nAfter first action at t=13, we go to t=14 with new y.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t, we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t=13, we choose a_{13}, which sets y_{14} = y_{13} + Δy.\n\nSimilarly, at t=14, choose a_{14}, sets y_{15}, and so on.\n\nWe start at y_{13} = 5.\n\nWe need y_{t} = 9 for some t, and we want to minimize the number of actions until we first reach y=9.\n\nSince we move one step at a time, from y=5 to y=9, we need at least 4 moves up, so minimal H is 4 if no cars, but with cars, it might be more.\n\nIn terms of turns, when we reach y=9.\n\nFor example, if we go up at t=13, y_{14} =6; up at t=14, y_{15}=7; up at t=15, y_{16}=8; up at t=16, y_{17}=9. So at t=17, we are at y=9, after 4 actions: t=13,14,15,16.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=9 is t=17, and we have taken actions at t=13,14,15,16, so H=4 actions? But the sequence is from t=13 to t=13+H-1, and at t=13+H-1, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn this case, at t=17, y=9, which is t=13+4, so 13+H-1=17, so H-1=4, H=5? Let's clarify.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nThen after these actions, at time t_1 + H, the position is set, and we need y_{t_1 + H} =9? No.\n\nAt turn T, after choosing action, we move to position for time T+1.\n\nSo at turn t_1, we choose a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t_1 + k, choose a_{t_1 + k}, determines y_{t_1 + k +1}.\n\nAfter H actions, we have set y_{t_1 +1} to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H} =9 for some H.\n\nAnd we start with y_{t_1} given.\n\nIn this case, t_1=13, y_{13}=5.\n\nWe need y_{13 + H} =9.\n\nMinimal H without cars is 4, with y_{14}=6, y_{15}=7, y_{16}=8, y_{17}=9, so H=4.\n\nWith cars, we need to ensure that for each turn from t=13 onwards, when we are on a freeway row y_t for t=13 to when we reach y=9, but y_t is the position at the beginning of turn t, I think.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T when we are on y_T, and if y_T is between 1 and 8, we check if 0 is in any car span on that row at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position (0, y_T), and we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}, but during turn T, we are on row y_T, so if y_T between 1 and 8, and there is a car on that row with 0 in span at T, collision.\n\nThen after moving, at T+1, we are on y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nWhen we reach y=9, at that turn, if it's turn T with y_T=9, since y=9 is not a freeway, no collision check, so it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, at start, y_{13}=5, which is a freeway, so we need to ensure no collision at t=13 on row 5.\n\nThen after action, we move to y_{14}, and at turn t=14, we are on y_{14}, and so on.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions such that for each turn from t=13 until the turn before we reach y=9, we don't have collision on the row we are on.\n\nSpecifically, for each turn T where y_T is between 1 and 8, no car on that row has 0 in span at T.\n\nNow, for rows y=9 and y=0, no cars, so no issue.\n\nIn this case, we start at t=13, y=5, so we need no collision at t=13 on row 5.\n\nThen we choose action to go to y_{14}, and so on.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars for each row.\n\nFreeways are rows 1 to 8.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nRow 1: one car: (head, tail, dir, speed) = (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nSince dir right, span at t_1=13 is [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt time T, span is [ -47 + 12(T-13), -36 + 12(T-13) ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [left, right] of span, so if left <= 0 <= right.\n\nSo for row 1 at time T, collision if -47 +12(T-13) <= 0 <= -36 +12(T-13)\n\nSimilarly, row 2: car (30,19, right,6)\n\nhead=30, tail=19, dir=right, so span at t_1: [19,30] since [τ,h]\n\nAt T: [19 +6(T-13), 30 +6(T-13)]\n\nRow 3: same as row 2, (30,19,right,6)\n\nRow 4: same, (30,19,right,6)\n\nRow 5: same, (30,19,right,6)  -- row 5 is where we are at t=13.\n\nRow 6: same, (30,19,right,6)\n\nRow 7: three cars: (30,19,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nFor each, span at T.\n\nFirst car: [19 +6(T-13), 30 +6(T-13)]\n\nSecond car: head=-48, tail=-59, dir=right, so span [τ,h] = [-59,-48] at t_1\n\nAt T: [-59 +6(T-13), -48 +6(T-13)]\n\nThird car: head=-12, tail=-23, dir=right, span [ -23, -12] at t_1\n\nAt T: [-23 +6(T-13), -12 +6(T-13)]\n\nSimilarly, row 8: same as row 7, three cars: (30,19,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nNow, for row 5 at t=13, we need to check if there is collision.\n\nRow 5 has one car: (30,19,right,6) at t_1=13.\n\nSpan at T=13: [19 +6(0), 30+6(0)] = [19,30]\n\n0 is not in [19,30], since 19>0, so 0 not in span, no collision at t=13 on row 5. Good.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nTo minimize turns, we want to go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions on intermediate rows.\n\nThe rows we might be on are y=5,6,7,8, and possibly others if we detour.\n\nSince we start at 5 and need to go to 9, going down might be necessary to avoid cars, but let's see if we can go directly up.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row and time, if there is a car causing collision.\n\nSince the cars move, we need to see when 0 is covered on each row.\n\nLet me define the time from t=13 onwards.\n\nSet τ = T - 13, so τ=0 at t=13.\n\nFor each row, find when collision happens, i.e., when 0 is in some car's span on that row.\n\nStart with row 1: one car, span at τ: [ -47 +12τ, -36 +12τ ]\n\nSet -47 +12τ <= 0 <= -36 +12τ\n\nSince the span is moving right, as τ increases.\n\nLeft end: -47 +12τ <=0 when 12τ <=47, τ <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so τ <=3 since τ integer? τ is turn offset, integer.\n\nT is turn number, integer, so τ = T-13, integer >=0.\n\nSimilarly, right end: 0 <= -36 +12τ when 12τ >=36, τ >=3.\n\nAnd left: -47 +12τ <=0 when 12τ <=47, τ <= 47/12 ≈3.916, so τ <=3 since τ integer.\n\nτ <=3 and τ >=3, so τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, left: -47+12*3 = -47+36= -11 <=0\n\nRight: -36+36=0 <=0, so 0 is included.\n\nAt τ=3, t=13+3=16, span is [-11,0], so 0 is in span, collision.\n\nFor other τ, not both conditions.\n\nAt τ=2: left: -47+24= -23 <=0, right: -36+24= -12 <0, so 0 > right? 0 not <= -12? right end is -12, 0 > -12, so 0 not in [-23,-12], since -12 <0.\n\nSimilarly, τ=4: left: -47+48=1 >0, right= -36+48=12>0, so [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo on row 1, collision only at τ=3, t=16.\n\nNow row 2: car (30,19,right,6), span at τ: [19 +6τ, 30 +6τ]\n\nSet 19+6τ <=0 <=30+6τ\n\nBut 19+6τ >=19>0 for τ>=0, so left end >0, so 0 < left, not in span. Thus no collision on row 2 at any time. Since min left is 19 at τ=0, all >0.\n\nSimilarly, row 3: same as row 2, no collision.\n\nRow 4: same, no collision.\n\nRow 5: car (30,19,right,6), same as above, span [19+6τ, 30+6τ] all >0, so no collision on row 5 at any time. At t=13, we are safe, as we saw.\n\nRow 6: same car, no collision.\n\nNow row 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (30,19,right,6), span [19+6τ, 30+6τ] >0, no issue.\n\nSecond car: (-48,-59,right,6), head=-48, tail=-59, dir right, span at τ: [-59 +6τ, -48 +6τ]\n\nSet -59+6τ <=0 <= -48+6τ\n\nLeft: -59+6τ <=0 when 6τ <=59, τ <=59/6≈9.833, τ<=9\n\nRight: 0 <= -48+6τ when 6τ >=48, τ>=8\n\nSo τ>=8 and τ<=9, so τ=8 or 9.\n\nAt τ=8: left: -59+48= -11 <=0, right: -48+48=0 <=0, so 0 in span.\n\nAt τ=9: left: -59+54= -5 <=0, right: -48+54=6 >=0, so 0 in [-5,6].\n\nAt τ=7: left: -59+42= -17 <=0, right: -48+42= -6 <0, so 0 not in [-17,-6]\n\nAt τ=10: left: -59+60=1>0, right= -48+60=12>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo collision at τ=8 and τ=9, t=13+8=21 and t=22.\n\nThird car on row 7: (-12,-23,right,6), span [-23 +6τ, -12 +6τ]\n\nSet -23+6τ <=0 <= -12+6τ\n\nLeft: -23+6τ <=0 when 6τ<=23, τ<=23/6≈3.833, τ<=3\n\nRight: 0 <= -12+6τ when 6τ>=12, τ>=2\n\nSo τ>=2 and τ<=3, τ=2,3.\n\nAt τ=2: left: -23+12= -11 <=0, right: -12+12=0 <=0, 0 in span.\n\nAt τ=3: left: -23+18= -5 <=0, right: -12+18=6 >=0, 0 in span.\n\nAt τ=1: left: -23+6= -17 <=0, right: -12+6= -6 <0, 0 not in.\n\nAt τ=4: left: -23+24=1>0, right= -12+24=12>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo for third car, collision at τ=2 and τ=3, t=15 and 16.\n\nNow for row 7, collision if any car has 0 in span, so:\n\n- At τ=2,3: third car has collision\n\n- At τ=8,9: second car has collision\n\nFirst car no collision.\n\nSo row 7 has collision at τ=2,3,8,9 i.e. t=15,16,21,22.\n\nSimilarly, row 8: same as row 7, three cars identical, so same collision times: t=15,16,21,22.\n\nNow row 1 has collision only at t=16 (τ=3).\n\nOthers no collision.\n\nWe start at t=13, y=5, no collision.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nThe critical rows are 6,7,8 since we need to pass through them to go up.\n\ny=5 to y=6 to y=7 to y=8 to y=9.\n\nBut row 7 and 8 have collisions at certain times.\n\nAlso, row 1 has collision but we are not going there, so irrelevant.\n\nNow, let's list the times when we might be on each row.\n\nAt turn t, we are on y_t.\n\nWe start at t=13, y=5.\n\nWe choose actions to change y.\n\nTo go to y=9, we need to be on y=6,7,8 at some points.\n\nFor row 6: no collision at any time, as we saw.\n\nRow 7: collision at t=15,16,21,22\n\nRow 8: collision at t=15,16,21,22\n\nNow, we need to avoid being on row 7 or 8 at those times.\n\nSimilarly, row 5 is safe at all times.\n\nWe might need to stay or move down to avoid being on a row at bad times.\n\nSince row 6 is always safe, we can be there anytime.\n\nNow, minimal path: up from 5 to 6 to 7 to 8 to 9.\n\nBut row 7 and 8 have dangers at t=15,16,21,22.\n\nNow, at what turns will we be on which row if we go directly up.\n\nSuppose we go up at each turn starting from t=13.\n\nAt t=13: choose a_{13}=U, then y_{14} =5 +1 =6\n\nAt t=14: on y=6, choose a_{14}=U, then y_{15}=7\n\nAt t=15: on y=7, but at t=15, row 7 has collision (since τ=2 for t=15, which is collision for row 7).\n\nt=15, τ=15-13=2, and row 7 collision at τ=2, so if we are on row 7 at t=15, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we continue: at t=15, we are on y=7, and we choose action, but during turn t=15, we are on row 7, and collision happens, so we die.\n\nCannot be on row 7 at t=15.\n\nSimilarly, at t=16, if on row 7, collision.\n\nNow, if we go up: at t=14, y=6, choose U, y_{15}=7.\n\nBut at t=15, on y=7, collision.\n\nSo we need to avoid that.\n\nWe could delay going to row 7.\n\nFor example, at t=13, instead of going up, we could stay or go down.\n\nBut going down might not help, since we need to go up eventually.\n\nWe could stay on row 5 or 6 for a while.\n\nRow 5 is safe, row 6 is safe.\n\nThen go up later when safe.\n\nNow, row 7 is unsafe at t=15,16,21,22.\n\nSimilarly row 8 unsafe at same times.\n\nBut after t=16, the next unsafe is t=21, which is later.\n\nt=17 to 20 are safe for rows 7 and 8? Let's see.\n\nFor row 7, collision at t=15,16,21,22.\n\nSo at t=17,18,19,20, no collision on row 7.\n\nSimilarly row 8 same.\n\nAlso, t=13,14 are safe? t=13: τ=0, for row 7, at τ=0, let's check.\n\nτ=0, t=13.\n\nFor row 7, third car: span at τ=0: [-23, -12], 0 not in, as -12<0.\n\nSecond car: [-59,-48], 0 not in.\n\nFirst car no issue.\n\nSo row 7 safe at t=13.\n\nSimilarly, t=14: τ=1.\n\nFor third car: [-23+6(1), -12+6(1)] = [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [-59+6, -48+6]=[-53,-42], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe at t=14.\n\nOnly unsafe at t=15,16,21,22.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nNow, to go from y=5 to y=9.\n\nWe need to be on row 7 and 8 at safe times.\n\nPossible to be on row 7 at t=17,18,19,20.\n\nSimilarly row 8 at those times.\n\nSince we need to be on row 7 before row 8 if going up.\n\nBut we can also go down, but it might take more turns.\n\nMinimal turns: we can be on row 7 at a safe time, then row 8 at safe time.\n\nFor example, suppose we stay on row 5 or 6 until t=16 or so.\n\nStart at t=13, y=5.\n\nWe can choose to stay or move.\n\nIf we go up immediately, we hit row 7 at t=15, unsafe.\n\nSo we need to delay.\n\nSuppose at t=13, we choose S (stay), then y_{14}=5 (since Δy=0)\n\nThen at t=14, we are on y=5, choose action.\n\nIf we choose U, y_{15}=6\n\nThen at t=15, on y=6, choose U, y_{16}=7\n\nAt t=16, on y=7, but t=16 is unsafe for row 7 (collision).\n\nStill bad.\n\nFrom t=14, on y=5, choose S, y_{15}=5\n\nThen at t=15, on y=5, choose U, y_{16}=6\n\nThen at t=16, on y=6, choose U, y_{17}=7\n\nNow at t=17, on y=7, which is safe (since t=17 not collision time).\n\nThen at t=17, choose U, y_{18}=8\n\nAt t=18, on y=8, which should be safe if t=18 not collision.\n\nt=18, τ=5, row 8: collision times t=15,16,21,22, so t=18 safe.\n\nThen at t=18, choose U, y_{19}=9, reached y=9 at t=19.\n\nNow, actions: from t=13 to t=18.\n\nList:\n\nTurn t=13: start at y=5, choose action. If we choose S, then y_{14}=5\n\nTurn t=14: at y=5, choose S? In this plan, at t=14, we are on y=5, and we choose S, so y_{15}=5\n\nThen t=15: on y=5, choose U, y_{16}=6\n\nt=16: on y=6, choose U, y_{17}=7\n\nt=17: on y=7, choose U, y_{18}=8\n\nt=18: on y=8, choose U, y_{19}=9\n\nAt t=19, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, we took actions from t=13 to t=18, that's 6 actions? Let's see the turns.\n\nActions at: t=13 (S), t=14 (S), t=15 (U), t=16 (U), t=17 (U), t=18 (U)\n\nThen after t=18 action, y_{19}=9.\n\nSo we reached at t=19.\n\nH is the number of turns in the sequence, so actions at t_1 to t_1+H-1, here t_1=13, actions at 13,14,15,16,17,18, that's 6 actions, H=6.\n\nBut at turn t=19, we are at y=9, so t_1 + H = 19? t_1 + H =13 +6=19, yes.\n\nMinimal without cars is H=4 to reach at t=17.\n\nBut here H=6.\n\nCan we do better?\n\nPerhaps we don't need to stay twice.\n\nFor example, at t=13, instead of staying, we could go up to y=6.\n\nBut if we go up at t=13, y_{14}=6.\n\nThen at t=14, on y=6, if we choose U, y_{15}=7, but t=15 on row 7 unsafe.\n\nIf at t=14, on y=6, we choose S, then y_{15}=6\n\nThen at t=15, on y=6, choose U, y_{16}=7\n\nBut at t=16, on y=7, which is unsafe (t=16 collision).\n\nt=16 is unsafe for row 7.\n\nSo we need to be on row 7 at t=17 or later.\n\nSimilarly, from y=6 at t=14, if we stay, y_{15}=6, then at t=15, on y=6, we can choose U to y_{16}=7, but t=16 on y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf at t=15, on y=6, we choose S, y_{16}=6, then at t=16, on y=6, choose U, y_{17}=7, safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nStart: t=13, y=5, choose U, so a_{13}=U, y_{14}=6\n\nt=14, on y=6, choose S, a_{14}=S, y_{15}=6\n\nt=15, on y=6, choose S, a_{15}=S, y_{16}=6\n\nt=16, on y=6, choose U, a_{16}=U, y_{17}=7\n\nt=17, on y=7, choose U, a_{17}=U, y_{18}=8\n\nt=18, on y=8, choose U, a_{18}=U, y_{19}=9\n\nReached at t=19, same as before, but we used one more stay? Actions: U at 13, S at 14, S at 15, U at 16, U at 17, U at 18. Still 6 actions to reach at t=19.\n\nBut earlier with two stays at start, also 6 actions.\n\nIn first plan: S at 13, S at 14, U at 15, U at 16, U at 17, U at 18. Same number.\n\nBut we can reach earlier if we can be on row 7 at t=17 directly.\n\nFor example, from start, if we can be on y=7 at t=17.\n\nAt t=13, y=5.\n\nIf we go up to y=6 at t=14.\n\nThen to be on y=7 at t=17, that means at turn t=17, y_{17}=7.\n\ny_{17} is set by action at t=16.\n\nIf at t=16, we choose U from y=6, then y_{17}=7.\n\nBut at t=16, we need to be on y=6 to choose that.\n\nSet times.\n\nWe need to be on row 7 at t=17, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 at t=18 or something.\n\nMinimal: if we can be on y=6 at t=16, then go U to y=7 at t=17.\n\nThen U to y=8 at t=18, U to y=9 at t=19.\n\nNow, to be on y=6 at t=16.\n\nStart from t=13, y=5.\n\nFrom t=13 to t=16, we need to reach y=6 at some point, but at t=16, we need to be on y=6 to choose U for next.\n\nAt turn t, we are on y_t, choose action to set y_{t+1}.\n\nTo have y_{17}=7, we need at t=16 to be on y_{16} and choose U.\n\nSimilarly, y_{16} could be 6 or 7 or 8, but to set y_{17}=7, we need to be on y_{16}=6 and choose U, or on y_{16}=7 and choose S, or on y_{16}=8 and choose D, but we want to go up, so better to be on 6 and go U.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, to be on y=6 at t=16.\n\nFrom start: at t=13, y=5.\n\nWe can go to y=6 quickly.\n\nFor example: at t=13, choose U, so y_{14}=6\n\nThen at t=14, on y=6, we can stay or move.\n\nBut if we stay, y_{15}=6, then at t=15, on y=6, if we stay, y_{16}=6, then at t=16, on y=6, choose U, y_{17}=7.\n\nNow, what about t=14,15,16 on row 6? Row 6 is always safe, no problem.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nActions:\n\nt=13: a_{13}=U, so y_{14}=6\n\nt=14: on y=6, choose S? To stay, a_{14}=S, y_{15}=6\n\nt=15: on y=6, choose S, a_{15}=S, y_{16}=6\n\nt=16: on y=6, choose U, a_{16}=U, y_{17}=7\n\nt=17: on y=7, choose U, a_{17}=U, y_{18}=8\n\nt=18: on y=8, choose U, a_{18}=U, y_{19}=9\n\nAgain, reached at t=19 with 6 actions.\n\nBut we have to be on row 7 at t=17, which is fine.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, can we be on y=7 at t=17, but y=9 at t=18 or 19.\n\ny=7 to y=8 to y=9, takes two more turns.\n\nMinimal from y=7 to y=9 is two steps, to y=8 then y=9.\n\nAt best, if on y=7 at t=17, then y=8 at t=18, y=9 at t=19.\n\nBut what if we can be on y=8 earlier at a safe time.\n\nRow 8 safe at t=17,18,19,20, etc.\n\nBut to be on y=8, we need to come from y=7 or y=9, but y=9 not yet.\n\nSo from y=7.\n\nBut y=7 must be at safe time.\n\nEarliest safe for row 7 is t=17? t=13,14,17,18,19,20 safe; unsafe 15,16,21,22.\n\nt=17 is safe.\n\nCan we be on y=7 at t=17? As above.\n\nBut t=17 is the earliest safe after t=14.\n\nt=14 is safe for row 7, but to be on row 7 at t=14.\n\nAt t=14, y=7.\n\nHow to get there?\n\nFrom start, at t=13, y=5, if we go up, y_{14}=6, not 7.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=14, we need y_{14}=7, which requires at t=13, we are on y=6 or7 or8, but we are on y=5, so to set y_{14}=7, we need to be on y=6 and choose U, or on y=7 and choose S, but we are on y=5, so impossible to be at y=7 at t=14 directly.\n\nThe earliest we can be on y=7 is t=15 if we go up twice: from t=13 U to y=6 at t=14, then U to y=7 at t=15.\n\nBut t=15 is unsafe for row 7.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=7 at t=16 requires going up at t=15 from y=6, but t=16 on row 7 unsafe.\n\nSo indeed, the earliest we can be on row 7 safely is t=17.\n\nSimilarly for row 8, earliest safe t=17.\n\nBut to be on row 8 at t=17, we need to come from row 7 or 9, so at t=16, if on row 7 and choose U, then y_{17}=8, so on row 8 at t=17.\n\nBut row 7 at t=16 is unsafe, so we cannot be on row 7 at t=16 to choose that.\n\nIf we are on row 8 at t=16 and choose S, but to be on row 8 at t=16, we need to have arrived earlier, which might not be possible or efficient.\n\nFor example, to be on row 8 at t=16, we need y_{16}=8.\n\nSet by action at t=15: from y=7 or8 or9.\n\nAt t=15, if on y=7 and choose U, y_{16}=8.\n\nBut at t=15, on row 7 is unsafe, so we cannot be there to choose.\n\nIf on y=8 at t=15 and choose S, but to be on y=8 at t=15, need to have y_{15}=8, set from t=14.\n\nAt t=14, if on y=7 and choose U, y_{15}=8.\n\nBut at t=14, on row 7 is safe? t=14 is safe, as we saw.\n\nt=14: τ=1, row 7 safe.\n\nSo, if we can be on row 7 at t=14, then choose U to go to y=8 at t=15.\n\nBut to be on row 7 at t=14.\n\nAt t=14, y=7.\n\nSet by action at t=13: from y=6 choose U, or y=7 choose S, etc.\n\nBut at t=13, we are on y=5.\n\nTo set y_{14}=7, we need at t=13 to be on y=6 and choose U.\n\nBut we are on y=5, so we need to be on y=6 at t=13 to choose U for y_{14}=7.\n\nBut at t=13, we are on y=5, not 6.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=7 at t=14.\n\nThe earliest we can be on y=7 is t=15: by going U at t=13 to y=6 at t=14, then U at t=14 to y=7 at t=15.\n\nBut at t=15, on row 7 unsafe.\n\nThus, we cannot be on row 7 at t=15 or 16.\n\nNext possible is t=17.\n\nTo be on row 7 at t=17, we need y_{17}=7.\n\nSet by action at t=16: from y=6 choose U, or from y=7 choose S, etc.\n\nSo we need to be on y=6 at t=16 to choose U, or on y=7 at t=16 to choose S, but if on y=7 at t=16, it is unsafe, so we cannot be there.\n\nThus, only option is to be on y=6 at t=16 and choose U to set y_{17}=7.\n\nSimilarly, to be on row 8 at t=17, we need to be on y=7 at t=16 and choose U, but y=7 at t=16 unsafe, so impossible.\n\nThus, we cannot be on row 8 at t=17; the earliest safe for row 8 is t=17, but we cannot be there at t=17 because to arrive at t=17, we need to have chosen action at t=16 from row 7, which is unsafe at t=16.\n\nTherefore, we must be on row 8 at t=18 or later.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 at t=17 or later.\n\nSo in the plan: be on row 7 at t=17, then row 8 at t=18, then row 9 at t=19.\n\nNow, to be on row 7 at t=17, we need to be on y=6 at t=16 to choose U.\n\nNow, we start at y=5 at t=13.\n\nWe need to be on y=6 at t=16.\n\nt=16 is the turn when we are on y_{16}=6.\n\ny_{16} is set by action at t=15.\n\nTo have y_{16}=6, at t=15 we can be on y=5,6,7 and choose appropriate action to set y=6.\n\nFor example: on y=5 and choose U? U would set y_{16}=6 if on y=5.\n\nOr on y=6 and choose S.\n\nOr on y=7 and choose D.\n\nBut we want to minimize, so probably stay or move up.\n\nNow, we need to be at y=6 at t=16.\n\nFrom t=13 to t=16.\n\nAt t=13, y=5.\n\nWe can go to y=6 at different times.\n\nFor example:\n\nOption 1: at t=13, choose U, so y_{14}=6. Then at t=14, on y=6, we need to stay or move to still be at y=6 at t=16.\n\ny_{16} is the position at turn t=16.\n\nTo have y_{16}=6, we need that the action at t=15 sets it.\n\nIf at t=15, we are on y=6 and choose S, then y_{16}=6.\n\nOr on y=5 and choose U, y_{16}=6.\n\nOr on y=7 and choose D, y_{16}=6.\n\nIn this case, since we are at y=6 at t=14, if we choose S at t=14, y_{15}=6, then at t=15, on y=6, choose S, y_{16}=6.\n\nThen at t=16, on y=6, choose U, y_{17}=7.\n\nAs before.\n\nTo save a turn, we could be on y=6 at t=16 by other means, but it might not save.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=5 longer.\n\nAt t=13, choose S, y_{14}=5.\n\nAt t=14, on y=5, choose U, y_{15}=6.\n\nThen at t=15, on y=6, we need y_{16}=6, so choose S, y_{16}=6.\n\nThen same as above.\n\nActions: t=13 S, t=14 U, t=15 S, t=16 U, t=17 U, t=18 U to y_{19}=9.\n\nStill 6 actions.\n\nt=13 S: y_{14}=5\n\nt=14 U: y_{15}=6\n\nt=15 S: y_{16}=6? At t=15, choose S, so y_{16}=6\n\nThen t=16 U: y_{17}=7\n\nt=17 U: y_{18}=8\n\nt=18 U: y_{19}=9\n\nYes.\n\nBut we have to check if during these, we are safe.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nAt t=13: on y=5, safe (no collision)\n\nAction S, y_{14}=5\n\nt=14: on y=5, safe (row 5 always safe)\n\nAction U, y_{15}=6\n\nt=15: on y=6, row 6 always safe, no collision.\n\nAction S, y_{16}=6\n\nt=16: on y=6, safe.\n\nAction U, y_{17}=7\n\nt=17: on y=7, now t=17, which is safe for row 7 (since collision only at 15,16,21,22)\n\nAction U, y_{18}=8\n\nt=18: on y=8, t=18 safe for row 8.\n\nAction U, y_{19}=9\n\nReached.\n\nH=6 actions: at t=13,14,15,16,17,18.\n\nBut earlier with immediate up and stay, same H.\n\nCan we reach with H=5?\n\nThat would mean reaching y=9 at t=18.\n\ny_{18}=9.\n\nSet by action at t=17: from y=8 choose U, or y=9 choose S, etc.\n\nTo have y_{18}=9, need at t=17 to be on y=8 and choose U.\n\nThen y_{18}=9.\n\nNow, to be on y=8 at t=17.\n\nSet by action at t=16: from y=7 choose U, or y=8 choose S, etc.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at t=17, we need to be on y=7 at t=16 and choose U, or on y=8 at t=16 and choose S.\n\nBut at t=16, row 7 is unsafe, so we cannot be on row 7 at t=16.\n\nIf we are on row 8 at t=16, then we can choose S to stay on row 8 at t=17.\n\nBut to be on row 8 at t=16.\n\ny_{16}=8.\n\nSet by action at t=15: from y=7 choose U, or from y=8 choose S, etc.\n\nAt t=15, if on y=7 and choose U, y_{16}=8.\n\nBut at t=15, on row 7 is unsafe, so we cannot.\n\nIf on y=8 at t=15 and choose S, y_{16}=8.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at t=15, need y_{15}=8, set from t=14.\n\nAt t=14, if on y=7 and choose U, y_{15}=8.\n\nAt t=14, on row 7 is safe, as t=14 safe.\n\nSo if we can be on row 7 at t=14, then choose U to y=8 at t=15.\n\nBut to be on row 7 at t=14: as before, impossible from start at y=5 t=13.\n\nThus, we cannot be on row 8 at t=16 or earlier safely.\n\nTherefore, the earliest we can be on row 8 is t=18: by being on row 7 at t=17 and choosing U.\n\nThen y_{18}=8, on row 8 at t=18.\n\nThen choose U to y_{19}=9.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at t=19 with H=6.\n\nIf we can be on row 8 at t=17, but we can't, as above.\n\nAnother idea: go down to avoid, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, go to y=4 or something, but rows below might have issues, but row 4 has no collision, etc.\n\nBut going down then up would take more turns, so worse.\n\nPerhaps stay on row 5 until later.\n\nBut row 5 safe.\n\nFor example, at t=13, choose S, y_{14}=5\n\nt=14, choose S, y_{15}=5\n\nt=15, on y=5, choose U, y_{16}=6\n\nBut now at t=16, on y=6, if we choose U, y_{17}=7, safe.\n\nThen U to y_{18}=8, U to y_{19}=9.\n\nBut we have two S at start, then U,U,U.\n\nActions: t=13 S, t=14 S, t=15 U (to y_{16}=6), t=16 U (to y_{17}=7), t=17 U (to y_{18}=8), t=18 U (to y_{19}=9). Still 6 actions.\n\nSame as before.\n\nWith only one stay: at t=13 U to y_{14}=6\n\nThen at t=14, on y=6, choose S, y_{15}=6\n\nt=15, on y=6, choose S, y_{16}=6? Then t=16 U to y_{17}=7, etc. Still need to be on y=6 at t=16 to go U.\n\nBut at t=15, if we choose U from y=6, y_{16}=7, but then at t=16 on row 7 unsafe.\n\nSo we must not be on row 7 at t=15 or 16.\n\nThus, we need to reach row 7 at t=17 or later.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 6, reaching at t=19.\n\nBut in the sequence, we can choose different actions to have fewer actions, but I think not.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly from y=6 to y=8 or something, but no, only change by 1 each turn.\n\nSo I think H=6 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to output the actions.\n\nIn the first plan I had: S at t=13, S at t=14, U at t=15, U at t=16, U at t=17, U at t=18.\n\nIn terms of the action at each turn.\n\nt_1 =13.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: S? But at turn 14, if we choose S, but in this, at turn 14, we are on y=5, choose S, so y_{15}=5.\n\nThen turn 15: on y=5, choose U, y_{16}=6\n\nBut we need to be on y=6 at t=16 for going to row 7.\n\nIn the sequence above, with S at 13 and 14, then U at 15 to y_{16}=6, then U at 16 to y_{17}=7.\n\nYes.\n\nWe can have U at 13 to y_{14}=6, then S at 14 to y_{15}=6, S at 15 to y_{16}=6, then U at 16 to y_{17}=7, U at 17 to y_{18}=8, U at 18 to y_{19}=9.\n\nBut that has three actions before moving up, but same H.\n\nTo have fewer actions, but H is the number, same.\n\nPerhaps we can reach row 7 earlier by going up faster, but we can't because of the unsafe times.\n\nAnother thought: what if we go down to row 4 or something, but row 4 is safe, but then to go to row 9, it takes more steps, so worse.\n\nFor example, from y=5, go down to y=4 at t=14, then need to go up to 5,6,7,8,9, at least 5 more steps, total more than 6.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo minimal H=6.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to specify the actions.\n\nAlso, we must ensure no collision during the path.\n\nIn the sequence with S at 13 and 14, then U,U,U,U.\n\nLet's write the positions:\n\nt=13: y=5, action a_{13}=S, so y_{14}=5\n\nt=14: y=5, action a_{14}=? In this plan, if a_{14}=S, then y_{15}=5\n\nt=15: y=5, action a_{15}=U, so y_{16}=6\n\nt=16: y=6, action a_{16}=U, so y_{17}=7\n\nt=17: y=7, action a_{17}=U, so y_{18}=8\n\nt=18: y=8, action a_{18}=U, so y_{19}=9\n\nAt t=19, y=9.\n\nCollision check:\n\n- t=13: on y=5, safe\n\n- t=14: on y=5, safe\n\n- t=15: on y=5, safe (row 5 always safe)\n\n- t=16: on y=6, safe (row 6 always safe)\n\n- t=17: on y=7, t=17 safe for row 7\n\n- t=18: on y=8, t=18 safe for row 8\n\nNo collision.\n\nWith U at 13: a_{13}=U, y_{14}=6\n\nThen a_{14}=S, y_{15}=6\n\na_{15}=S, y_{16}=6\n\na_{16}=U, y_{17}=7\n\na_{17}=U, y_{18}=8\n\na_{18}=U, y_{19}=9\n\nCollision:\n\nt=13: y=5 safe\n\nt=14: y=6 safe\n\nt=15: y=6 safe\n\nt=16: y=6 safe\n\nt=17: y=7 safe\n\nt=18: y=8 safe\n\nAlso fine.\n\nIn this case, at t=15, we are on y=6, not on row 7, so no issue.\n\nBoth sequences work with H=6.\n\nBut perhaps we can do with H=5?\n\nSuppose we want y_{18}=9.\n\nThen need at t=17 on y=8 and choose U.\n\nTo be on y=8 at t=17.\n\nNeed at t=16 on y=7 and choose U, or on y=8 choose S.\n\nBut at t=16, cannot be on y=7 because unsafe.\n\nIf on y=8 at t=16, then choose S to stay on y=8 at t=17.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at t=16.\n\nNeed at t=15 on y=7 and choose U, or on y=8 choose S.\n\nAt t=15, cannot be on y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf on y=8 at t=15, choose S, y_{16}=8.\n\nThen at t=16, on y=8, choose S? To have y_{17}=8, but we need y_{17}=8 to choose U for y_{18}=9.\n\nIf at t=16 on y=8, choose S, y_{17}=8, then at t=17 on y=8, choose U, y_{18}=9.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at t=15.\n\ny_{15}=8.\n\nSet by action at t=14: from y=7 choose U.\n\nAt t=14, on y=7, choose U, y_{15}=8.\n\nNow, to be on y=7 at t=14.\n\nBut as before, impossible from start.\n\nThus, cannot reach y=8 early.\n\nTherefore, H=6 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the sequence.\n\nWe can choose any sequence that works.\n\nIn the car state, for row 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but we already considered the collision times.\n\nAlso, row 1 has collision at t=16, but we are not there.\n\nNow, the sequence.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly with fewer delays.\n\nAnother idea: since row 6 is safe, we can be on row 6 at t=14, then stay until t=16, then go to 7 at t=17.\n\nBut as before.\n\nWith actions: U at 13, S at 14, S at 15, U at 16, U at 17, U at 18.\n\nH=6.\n\nIn the output format, we need to list the actions from turn t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nt_1=13.\n\nH=6, so actions at t=13 to t=18.\n\nThe sequence: a_{13}, a_{14}, a_{15}, a_{16}, a_{17}, a_{18}\n\nIn the first version: S, S, U, U, U, U\n\nOr U, S, S, U, U, U\n\nBoth fine.\n\nPerhaps we can have only one stay.\n\nFor example, at t=13, choose U, y_{14}=6\n\nThen at t=14, on y=6, we need to be on y=6 at t=16, so we must choose S at t=14 and S at t=15? Or choose S at t=14 to y_{15}=6, then at t=15, if we choose S, y_{16}=6.\n\nIf at t=15 we choose U, y_{16}=7, unsafe at t=16.\n\nSo we must choose S at t=15 to stay on 6.\n\nThus, we need two stays: one at t=14 and one at t=15 if we went up early.\n\nIf we stay at start, we have stays at t=13 and t=14.\n\nSame number.\n\nSo no saving.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 6.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nI think we should output one sequence.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for row 7 and 8, there are three cars, but we have the collision times covered.\n\nNow, the initial position is (0,5), but at turn t=13, we are on y=5, and we choose action.\n\nIn the sequence, we don't output for turn when we reach, only actions until the last action that sets y to 9.\n\nIn this case, actions from t=13 to t=18.\n\nLet me write the sequence with U first.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAfter a_{18}=U, y_{19}=9.\n\nTo confirm the turns:\n\nt=13: position y=5, choose U, so move to y=6 at next turn.\n\nt=14: now on y=6, choose S, stay at y=6.\n\nt=15: on y=6, choose S, stay at y=6.\n\nt=16: on y=6, choose U, move to y=7.\n\nt=17: on y=7, choose U, move to y=8.\n\nt=18: on y=8, choose U, move to y=9.\n\nAt t=19, y=9.\n\nCollision avoided as before.\n\nWith S first: Turn 13: S, Turn 14: S, Turn 15: U, Turn 16: U, Turn 17: U, Turn 18: U\n\nThen: t=13: y=5, S, y_{14}=5\n\nt=14: y=5, S, y_{15}=5? If a_{14}=S, y_{15}=5\n\nt=15: y=5, U, y_{16}=6\n\nt=16: y=6, U, y_{17}=7\n\nt=17: y=7, U, y_{18}=8\n\nt=18: y=8, U, y_{19}=9\n\nSame.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nPerhaps the one with U first has less down time, but same.\n\nIn the output, we need to box it.\n\nAlso, for row 7 and 8, at t=21,22 unsafe, but we are not there.\n\nNow, the minimal number is H=6.\n\nBut let me confirm if we can do with H=5.\n\nSuppose we go up at t=13 to y_{14}=6\n\nThen at t=14, on y=6, instead of staying, we go up to y_{15}=7, but then at t=15 on y=7 collision, not possible.\n\nOr go down, but worse.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be a sequence of 6 actions.\n\nI'll go with the first one I thought.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 15, we choose U, from y=5 to y=6, then at turn 16 U to y=7, etc.\n\nIn terms of the action labels.\n\nNow, for the box.\n\nThe answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: S\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n}\n\nBut H=6, actions from t=13 to t=18.\n\nt=18 is the last action.\n\nAfter that, at turn 19, we are at y=9, but we don't act there.\n\nIn the sequence, it says up to t_1 + H -1, which is 13+5=18? H=6, t_1 + H -1 =13+6-1=18, yes.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so t_1 + t for t=0 to 5, since H=6, t=0,1,2,3,4,5, so turns 13,14,15,16,17,18.\n\nYes.\n\nTo write it clearly.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\) is 6, with the sequence of actions starting from turn 13.\n\n### Solution Summary:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 5\\) at turn 13.\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\) in minimal turns while avoiding collisions, the player must delay moving to row 7 until turn 17, as rows 7 and 8 have collisions at turns 15, 16, 21, and 22.\n- Rows 5 and 6 are always safe, as no car on these rows covers position \\(x = 0\\) at any turn.\n- By staying on row 5 for turns 13 and 14, then moving up to row 6 at turn 15, and finally moving up to rows 7, 8, and 9 at turns 16, 17, and 18 respectively, the player avoids all collisions and reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 13 (current turn)**: Stay (S) to remain on row 5, which is safe.\n- **Turn 14**: Stay (S) to remain on row 5, which is safe.\n- **Turn 15**: Move up (U) to reach row 6 at turn 16. Row 6 is safe at all times.\n- **Turn 16**: Move up (U) to reach row 7 at turn 17. Row 7 is safe at turn 17 (not a collision time).\n- **Turn 17**: Move up (U) to reach row 8 at turn 18. Row 8 is safe at turn 18 (not a collision time).\n- **Turn 18**: Move up (U) to reach row 9 at turn 19.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Turn 13**: Player on row 5. Row 5 has a car with span \\([19 + 6(\\tau), 30 + 6(\\tau)]\\) where \\(\\tau = T - 13\\). At \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 13), span is \\([19, 30]\\), which does not contain 0. Safe.\n- **Turn 14**: Player on row 5. Same as above, span at \\(\\tau = 1\\) is \\([25, 36]\\), does not contain 0. Safe.\n- **Turn 15**: Player on row 5. Same as above, span at \\(\\tau = 2\\) is \\([31, 42]\\), does not contain 0. Safe.\n- **Turn 16**: Player on row 6. Row 6 has a car with span \\([19 + 6(\\tau), 30 + 6(\\tau)]\\). At \\(\\tau = 3\\) (turn 16), span is \\([37, 48]\\), does not contain 0. Safe.\n- **Turn 17**: Player on row 7.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 14, and the player is at (0,5). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0) in y-coordinate. Note that the grid is from y=0 to y=9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the car's span at turn T covers the x=0 position.\n\nImportant: When moving from y to y' at turn T, note that:\n- At turn T, the player is on y (the starting row) and then moves to y' at the next turn (so at turn T+1 the player is on y').\n- Thus, at turn T, we check for collision only on the current row y (the one we are leaving).\n\nHowever, note the problem states: \n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\nAnd also: \n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_{T} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo at a given turn T, the player is on row y_T. We only check the cars on row y_T at turn T.\n\nTherefore, when we are at row y at turn T, we must ensure that no car on that row y (at turn T) has a span that includes 0.\n\nWe are starting at turn 14, at y=5.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9 (which is the top row, and note that y=9 is not a freeway? Actually, the freeways are y=1 to 8. So once we get to y=9, we are safe? And we don't have to worry about cars on y=9? Because the problem says avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8. So y=0 and y=9 are safe? But note the player update: y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. And the goal is (0,9). So at the turn when we are at y=9, we are done. We don't have to worry about cars on row 9 because there are no freeways at 9? Actually, the freeways are only 1 to 8. So row 0 and row 9 are safe.\n\nBut note: when we are at row 9, we are done. However, to get to row 9, we must pass through row 8. And on row 8 we have cars.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1=14. We need to compute the car spans at future turns.\n\nFor each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed). Note that the representation:\n\nFor a right-moving car: the span at turn t1 is [τ, h] (meaning from tail to head, so tail is the leftmost and head the rightmost? Actually, the problem says:\n- For left-moving: at t1: [h, τ] -> then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n- For right-moving: at t1: [τ, h] -> then at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the example: \n  For a right-moving car: initial span [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSo the car moves to the right as time increases.\n\nNow, the cars:\n\nFreeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 12)\n  At t1=14: the car is from -35 to -24? But note: the representation is (head, tail) and direction. The problem says for right-moving: the initial span is [τ, h]? But here we have (head=-24, tail=-35). Since it's right-moving, the head should be the rightmost? So the span is [tail, head] = [-35, -24]. Then at time T, it becomes [-35 + 12*(T-14), -24 + 12*(T-14)].\n\nSimilarly, for freeways 2 to 6: each has (36,25,right,6). But note: head=36, tail=25? For a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost? Then the span at t1=14 is [25,36]. Then at T: [25 + 6*(T-14), 36 + 6*(T-14)].\n\nFor freeway 7 and 8, each has three cars. We have to consider all cars on the same freeway.\n\nFreeway 7: \n  Car1: (36,25,right,6) -> [25,36] at t1=14 -> then [25+6*(T-14), 36+6*(T-14)]\n  Car2: (-42,-53,right,6) -> [-53,-42] at t1=14 -> then [-53+6*(T-14), -42+6*(T-14)]\n  Car3: (-6,-17,right,6) -> [-17,-6] at t1=14 -> then [-17+6*(T-14), -6+6*(T-14)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) for the player starting at turn 14 (which is the first action) until we reach y=9.\n\nWe want minimal H (number of turns). The minimal H is at least 4 because we start at y=5 and need to go to y=9 (4 steps up). But we might have to wait due to cars.\n\nLet's try to see if we can go straight up in 4 moves: \n  Actions: U, U, U, U -> so at turns: 14,15,16,17,18? Actually, H is the number of turns, so we start at turn 14 and take H actions? The problem says: sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1. So we take H actions starting at t1, and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\nSo if we take 4 actions: \n  Turn 14: U -> y becomes 6\n  Turn 15: U -> y becomes 7\n  Turn 16: U -> y becomes 8\n  Turn 17: U -> y becomes 9 -> done. So H=4.\n\nBut we must check for collisions at each turn:\n\nAt turn 14: we are at y=5. We are leaving y=5. We must check freeway 5 at turn 14.\n\nFreeway 5: only one car: (36,25,right,6) -> at turn 14: [25,36]. Does 0 fall in [25,36]? No. So safe.\n\nAt turn 15: we are at y=6. We check freeway 6 at turn 15.\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5: [25,36] at turn 14. At turn 15 (T=15): \n  [25+6*(15-14)=31, 36+6=42] -> [31,42]. 0 is not in there. Safe.\n\nAt turn 16: we are at y=7. We check freeway 7 at turn 16.\n\nFreeway 7 has three cars at turn 16 (T=16, so T-14=2):\n\nCar1: [25+6*2=37, 36+12=48] -> [37,48] -> no 0.\nCar2: [-53+6*2 = -53+12 = -41, -42+12=-30] -> [-41,-30] -> no 0.\nCar3: [-17+12=-5, -6+12=6] -> [-5,6]. Does 0 fall in [-5,6]? Yes, 0 is in [-5,6]. So collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot do U at turn 16 when we are at y=7? Actually, at turn 16 we are at y=7 and we are about to move to y=8? But the collision check is at the row we are currently on (y=7) at turn 16. Since 0 is in the span of the third car on freeway7 at turn16, we collide.\n\nSo we cannot take U at turn16? But we are at y=7 at turn16 and we are going to move to y=8 at the end of turn16? However, the collision happens because we are present on row7 at turn16 and the car is covering 0 on row7 at that turn.\n\nSo we must avoid that.\n\nTherefore, the straight path fails at turn16.\n\nWe must either wait at y=7 or take a detour? But we cannot go down because we are at y=7 and we need to go to y=9. Going down would be counterproductive.\n\nAlternatively, we can wait at y=6 for one turn? Then we would be:\n\nOption: \n  Turn14: U -> y=6\n  Turn15: S (stay at y=6) -> then at turn15 we are at y=6? But we already checked y=6 at turn15: it was safe (freeway6: [31,42] at turn15, safe).\n  Turn16: U -> then we go to y=7 at the end of turn16? So at turn16 we are at y=6? Actually, during turn16 we are at y=6 (starting at turn16) and then we move to y=7 at the end of turn16. So we only check freeway6 at turn16.\n\nWhat is the state of freeway6 at turn16? \n  Freeway6: [25+6*(16-14)=25+12=37, 36+12=48] -> [37,48] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn17: we move to y=7? Then we are at y=7 at the start of turn17? Then we check freeway7 at turn17.\n\nFreeway7 at turn17 (T=17, T-14=3):\n  Car1: [25+6*3=43, 36+18=54] -> [43,54] -> safe.\n  Car2: [-53+18=-35, -42+18=-24] -> [-35,-24] -> safe.\n  Car3: [-17+18=1, -6+18=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn17 we are at y=7 and we do U? Then we move to y=8 at the end of turn17? Then at turn18 we are at y=8? Then we must check freeway8 at turn18? But we are at y=7 at turn17? So we check freeway7 at turn17: safe.\n\nThen turn17: U -> y=8 at the end of turn17? Then at turn18 we are at y=8? Then we must check freeway8 at turn18.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7? Actually, the state is the same: three cars.\n\nAt turn18 (T=18, T-14=4):\n  Car1: [25+6*4=49, 36+24=60] -> safe.\n  Car2: [-53+24=-29, -42+24=-18] -> safe.\n  Car3: [-17+24=7, -6+24=18] -> [7,18] -> 0 not in [7,18] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn18: we do U? Then we go to y=9 at the end of turn18? Then we are done at turn18? So H=5 turns: turns 14 to 18.\n\nBut we need to check the entire path:\n\nTurn14: start at y=5 -> action U -> then at the end of turn14 we are at y=6. Check at turn14: we are at y=5? Actually, the rule: at turn T, the player is at y_T. Then we choose an action. Then the update: y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn14, we are at (0,5). We choose an action. Then at the end of the turn, we move to the new y.\n\nBut the collision check: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nSo at turn T, we are at y_T. We are present on that row during the turn? So we must check that row at that turn.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Turn14: we start at y=5. We choose action U. Then we check freeway5 at turn14: [25,36] -> safe. Then we move to y=6 at the end of the turn.\n\n- Turn15: we are at y=6. We choose action S. Then we check freeway6 at turn15: [25+6*(15-14)=31, 36+6=42] -> safe. Then we remain at y=6? (because S)\n\n- Turn16: we are at y=6. We choose action U. Then we check freeway6 at turn16: [25+12=37,36+12=48] -> safe. Then we move to y=7 at the end of turn16.\n\n- Turn17: we are at y=7. We choose action U. Then we check freeway7 at turn17: \n    Car1: [25+18=43, 36+18=54] -> safe.\n    Car2: [-53+18=-35, -42+18=-24] -> safe.\n    Car3: [-17+18=1, -6+18=12] -> [1,12] does not include 0 -> safe.\n  Then we move to y=8 at the end of turn17.\n\n- Turn18: we are at y=8. We choose action U. Then we check freeway8 at turn18: \n    Car1: [25+24=49, 36+24=60] -> safe.\n    Car2: [-53+24=-29, -42+24=-18] -> safe.\n    Car3: [-17+24=7, -6+24=18] -> [7,18] -> safe.\n  Then we move to y=9 at the end of turn18 -> done.\n\nSo we have 5 actions: U, S, U, U, U.\n\nBut is there a faster way? We saw that going straight up (4 moves) fails at turn16 because at turn16 we were at y=7 and the car on freeway7 at turn16 had [-5,6] which includes 0.\n\nCan we avoid waiting? Maybe by going up faster? We only have 4 moves. We must be at y=9 at the end of the fourth move? But we cannot skip rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can go up to y=7 at an earlier time? But we start at turn14. We have to go through y=7 at some turn. The car on freeway7 at turn16 is problematic. So we must avoid being on y=7 at turn16.\n\nWe could be at y=7 at turn15? How?\n\nIf we do U at turn14 -> y=6 at end of turn14.\nThen at turn15: we do U -> then at the end of turn15 we are at y=7. Then at turn15 we are at y=6? Then at turn15 we check freeway6: safe? Then at the end of turn15 we are at y=7. Then at turn16 we are at y=7? Then we check freeway7 at turn16: which we know has car3: [-5,6] -> collision.\n\nAlternatively, if we do U at turn14 -> y=6 at end of turn14.\nThen at turn15: we do U -> then at the end of turn15 we are at y=7. Then at turn15 we were at y=6? So we check freeway6 at turn15: safe. Then at turn16 we are at y=7 and we have to check freeway7 at turn16: collision.\n\nSo we cannot avoid being at y=7 at turn16 by going faster? Because we start at turn14 at y=5. The earliest we can be at y=7 is at the end of turn16? Actually:\n\n  Turn14: U -> end at y=6\n  Turn15: U -> end at y=7 -> so at the beginning of turn16 we are at y=7.\n\nBut we need to check at turn16 (when we are at y=7) and that is when the car is at [-5,6] -> collision.\n\nAlternatively, we could go to y=7 at a later time? We tried by waiting at y=6 for one turn and then going to y=7 at turn17? Actually, in our 5-move plan we were at y=7 at the beginning of turn17? Then we check freeway7 at turn17: which was safe.\n\nBut is there a 4-move solution? We need 4 moves to go from 5 to 9. We must have:\n\n  Turn14: U -> y=6\n  Turn15: U -> y=7\n  Turn16: U -> y=8\n  Turn17: U -> y=9\n\nBut we saw that at turn16 (when we are at y=7) we collide. And at turn15 we are at y=6, which is safe. At turn14: y=5 safe. At turn17: when we are at y=8? We must check freeway8 at turn17.\n\nAt turn17, freeway8 (T=17, T-14=3):\n  Car1: [25+18=43, 36+18=54] -> safe.\n  Car2: [-53+18=-35, -42+18=-24] -> safe.\n  Car3: [-17+18=1, -6+18=12] -> [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo the only problem is at turn16 at y=7.\n\nWe must avoid being at y=7 at turn16. But we are forced to be at y=7 at turn16 if we do U at turn15. So we cannot do that.\n\nAlternatively, we could go down? But that would take more moves. For example, go down to y=4? Then we need even more moves. So that would be worse.\n\nAnother idea: at turn16, instead of going up, we go down? Then we avoid the collision at y=7? But then we are at y=6 at the end of turn16? Then we have to come back up. So that would take more than 5 moves.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in 5 moves without waiting? For example, by taking a detour? But we can only move vertically. And we must avoid the cars. The cars are only a problem on row7 at turn16. So if we are not on row7 at turn16, we are safe.\n\nWe could be at row8 at turn16? How?\n\n  Start at y=5 at turn14.\n  Turn14: U -> y=6\n  Turn15: U -> y=7 -> but then at turn15 we are at y=6? Then at turn15 we check freeway6: safe? Then at the end of turn15 we are at y=7. Then at turn16 we are at y=7 -> collision.\n\nWe cannot jump.\n\nAlternatively, we could be at row8 at turn16 only if we were at row7 at turn15? But we start at row5 at turn14. Then at turn14: we go to row6. Then at turn15: we go to row7. Then at turn16: we go to row8. So we are at row7 at turn16? No, at the beginning of turn16 we are at row7. Then we move to row8 at the end of turn16. But we still have to check row7 at turn16 -> collision.\n\nSo we must avoid being at row7 at turn16. The only way is to not be on row7 at turn16. That means we must be at row7 at a different turn.\n\nWe already tried being at row7 at turn17: by waiting at row6 at turn15 (with action S). Then at turn16 we go from row6 to row7? Then at turn16 we are at row6? So we check row6 at turn16: safe. Then we move to row7 at the end of turn16. Then at turn17 we are at row7? Then we check row7 at turn17: which is safe.\n\nSo that is the plan we have.\n\nIs there a way to do it in 5 moves without waiting? For example, by going up to row8 and then down? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up to row9 via row8 at a different time? But we have to go through row7 and row8.\n\nWe might try to be at row7 at turn18? But that would be even later.\n\nSo the minimal H is 5.\n\nBut note: we are at row5 at turn14. We need to get to row9. The minimal moves without obstacles is 4. With obstacles, we have to wait one turn. So 5 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence:\n\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: S   (we wait at row6 to avoid being at row7 at turn16)\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut wait, at the end of turn18 we are at row9? Yes.\n\nWe have to check the last move: at turn18 we are at row8 and we do U. We check row8 at turn18: which we did above (safe).\n\nBut note: the problem says we have to avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8. We are not on any freeway at row9? And row0 and row9 are safe.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway8 at turn18: \n  T=18, T-14=4.\n  Car1: [25+6*4=49, 36+24=60] -> [49,60] -> 0 not in.\n  Car2: [-53+24=-29, -42+24=-18] -> [-29,-18] -> 0 not in.\n  Car3: [-17+24=7, -6+24=18] -> [7,18] -> 0 not in.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd at turn17, freeway7: \n  T=17, T-14=3.\n  Car3: [-17+18=1, -6+18=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". And H=5. So we have 5 actions.\n\nBut note: the starting turn is t1=14. So:\n\nTurn 14: a_{14} = U\nTurn 15: a_{15} = S\nTurn 16: a_{16} = U\nTurn 17: a_{17} = U\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U\n\nAnd then at the end of turn18, we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1. So at turn 18 (which is 14+5-1=18) we are at (0,9).\n\nPerfect.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 5 moves without the S? For example, by going down at some point? Let me see:\n\nSuppose we do:\n  Turn14: U -> y=6\n  Turn15: U -> y=7 -> but then at turn16 we are at y=7 -> collision? So we avoid that.\n\n  Turn14: D -> y=4 -> then we have to go up 5 steps -> at least 5 more moves? Total 6 moves -> worse.\n\n  Turn14: U -> y=6\n  Turn15: D -> y=5 -> then at turn16: we are at y=5 -> then we need to go up to 9: 4 more moves -> total 6 moves.\n\nSo worse.\n\nTherefore, the minimal is 5 with the waiting at y=6.\n\nBut note: at turn15, we did S. We could have done D? But that would be going down to y=5? Then we have to go up again. That would be more moves.\n\nSo the sequence we have is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". The index t goes from 0 to H-1. So:\n\nt=0: a_{14} (which is turn14)\nt=1: a_{15}\nt=2: a_{16}\nt=3: a_{17}\nt=4: a_{18}\n\nSo we have:\n\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\", so we write:\n\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut wait, the current turn is t1=14, and we are to write the actions for the next turns.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Answer Format: \n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\"\n\nSo we write:\n\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence? What if we can reach y=9 in 4 moves by a different route? We cannot because we must move up 4 steps. The only way is to do four U's, but that fails at turn16.\n\nAlternatively, we might skip a row by moving two at once? But no, we can only move by 1 each turn.\n\nSo I think 5 is minimal.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it without the wait? Maybe by being at y=8 at turn16? Then we avoid y=7 at turn16? How?\n\nWe start at y=5 at turn14.\n  Turn14: U -> y=6\n  Turn15: U -> y=7 -> then at turn15 we are at y=6? Then at turn16 we are at y=7 -> collision.\n\nWe cannot.\n\nAlternatively, if we do two U's in a row? But we are constrained by the moves.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 14\\) is 5.

The current turn is t_1 = 15.\n\nThe player moves up, down, or stays with actions U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move on specific freeways, and I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at position 0 at that turn. The collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I decide to move to y_{T+1}, but I'm not on y_{T+1} until the next turn, so I only care about the car on the current row at the current turn.\n\nNow, looking at the car states:\n\nFor each freeway k (which I assume is y=k), there are cars listed with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right means it's moving right, so for right-moving cars, the span at time T is [tail + s*(T - t_1), head + s*(T - t_1)]? Let me check the update rule.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, at t_1, span is [τ, h] with τ ≤ h, I assume, since it's from tail to head.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h ≤ τ? No, let's see.\n\nIn left-moving, it says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\", and for left-moving, span is [h, τ], which might imply h < τ or something? But in the update, it's decreasing.\n\nI think I need to interpret the span.\n\nTypically, for a car, the span is the positions it occupies, from min to max.\n\nBut in the notation, for right-moving, it says span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head, and since it's moving right, tail is left, head is right, so τ < h.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ], and since moving left, head is left, tail is right, so h < τ.\n\nThen when moving left, positions decrease.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, for a car on freeway i, we need 0 to be in Span(T) for collision to occur if player is on row i at turn T.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find for which turns T (relative to t_1) there is a car such that 0 is in its span at T.\n\nt_1 is 15, so let τ = T - t_1, the time offset.\n\nI need for each row y from 1 to 8, and for each time τ ≥ 0, whether there is a car on that row with 0 in its span at time τ.\n\nBut since the cars are moving, I need to compute for each car when 0 is in its span.\n\nFirst, list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (-12, -23, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, so at time t_1, span is [τ, h] = [-23, -12]? Let's see the notation.\n\nIt says: Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor freeway 1: (-12, -23, right, 12)\n\nSo head = -12, tail = -23, direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nSince moving right, at time T, span is [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)] = [-23 + 12*τ, -12 + 12*τ] where τ = T - t_1\n\nSet u = T - t_1 for simplicity, so u ≥ 0.\n\nSpan at u: [-23 + 12u, -12 + 12u]\n\n0 is in span if -23 + 12u ≤ 0 ≤ -12 + 12u\n\nSo -23 + 12u ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -12 + 12u\n\nFirst inequality: -23 + 12u ≤ 0 ⇒ 12u ≤ 23 ⇒ u ≤ 23/12 ≈ 1.916, so u ≤ 1 since u integer? u is turn offset, so integer.\n\nTurns are discrete, so u integer.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 ≤ -12 + 12u ⇒ 12u ≥ 12 ⇒ u ≥ 1\n\nSo for u=1: -23 + 12*1 = -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0? 0 ≤ -12 + 12*1 = 0, yes, 0 ≤ 0 is true.\n\n-12 + 12u at u=1 is -12+12=0, so 0 ≤ 0, yes.\n\nAnd -23+12= -11 ≤ 0, true.\n\nFor u=2: -23+24=1 ≤ 0? 1 ≤ 0 false, so 0 not ≤ upper bound?

Third car: span [-11,0], 0 in, so yes collision possible at T=15.\n\nAt u=1 (T=16), first car no, second car: span [-47+6,-36+6]=[-41,-30], 0 not in, third car: [-11+6,6]=[-5,6], 0 in, so yes.\n\nAt u=2 (T=17): first car no, second car: [-47+12,-36+12]=[-35,-24], 0 not, third car: [1,12], 0 not, so no collision at u=2.\n\nSimilarly, u=3,4,5: no.\n\nu=6: second car has 0 in span, as above, span [-11,0]? No, second car at u=6: [-47+36,-36+36]=[-11,0], yes 0 in. First car no, third car: at u=6, [-11+36, 36]=[25,36], 0 not in. So yes, collision at u=6.\n\nu=7: second car span [-5,6], 0 in. Third car [31,42]? Third car at u=7: [-11+42,42]= [31,42], 0 not. First car no. So collision.\n\nu=8: second car span [1,12], 0 not, others no.\n\nu=9: etc., but second car only up to u=7.\n\nSo for row 7, collision at turns: T=15 (u=0), T=16 (u=1), T=21 (u=6), T=22 (u=7)\n\nT = t_1 + u, t_1=15, so T=15,16,21,22.\n\nNow freeway 8: same cars as freeway 7? \"7 | ... | 8 | same\"\n\nFreeway 8: (42,31,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6), (0,-11,right,6)\n\nSame as row 7.\n\nSo similarly, collision at same times: T=15,16,21,22.\n\nNow, what about other rows?\n\nRow 1: only collision at T=16, as we found.\n\nRow 2 to 6: no collisions, since the cars are at positions that don't reach 0.\n\nFor example, row 2: car (42,31,right,6), span [31+6u,42+6u] always positive, 0 never in.\n\nSimilarly rows 3,4,5,6 same, only one car each, same as row 2.\n\nRow 6 has same as row 2? Freeway 6: only (42,31,right,6), yes.\n\nBut row 7 and 8 have multiple.\n\nPlayer starts at y=6 at turn t_1=15.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe player is at (0,6) at turn 15.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to go to y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is above, I probably want to go up, but I need to avoid the rows when there are collisions.\n\nPossible actions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same).\n\ny from 0 to 9, so at y=0, cannot go down; at y=9, cannot go up, but since I want to reach (0,9), I stop when I get there.\n\nThe sequence should end when y=9.\n\nNow, current turn t_1=15, position y=6.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is +3 in y, so minimum 3 turns if I go up each time, but I might need to wait or detour due to collisions.\n\nFirst, let's list the collision times per row:\n\nRow 1: collision at T=16 only (from car)\n\nRow 2: no collision at any time\n\nRow 3: no collision\n\nRow 4: no\n\nRow 5: no\n\nRow 6: no collision? Freeway 6 has car (42,31,right,6), which never at 0, so no collision on row 6 at any time.\n\nSimilarly row 5,4,3,2 same.\n\nRow 7: collision at T=15,16,21,22\n\nRow 8: collision at T=15,16,21,22\n\nAt current turn T=15, player is on row 6.\n\nIf I stay on row 6 at T=15, no problem, since row 6 has no collision.\n\nBut I need to move to row 7 or 8 or directly to 9.\n\ny=9 is not freeway, so no issue.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to be at y=8 and go up, or y=9 directly if I move up from 8.\n\nThe position is (0,y), and I move vertically.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, and I choose action for next position.\n\nTurn T: I am at y_T, I choose a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + delta, with delta from action.\n\nCollision: at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and if there is a car on that row with 0 in span at T, collision.\n\nIn this case, at T=15, I am on y=6, which is freeway, but row 6 has no car at position 0, so safe.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nSince rows 2-6 are always safe, no cars ever at 0, so I can be there any time.\n\nRows 7 and 8 have dangerous times: T=15,16,21,22 are bad.\n\nT=15 and 16 are soon, t_1=15.\n\nI want to minimize H, the number of turns.\n\nThe fastest way is to go up directly: from 6 to 7 to 8 to 9.\n\nBut at T=15, I am at y=6.\n\nIf I go up at T=15, to y=7 at T=16.\n\nAction at T: a_T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nLet me define the turns carefully.\n\nAt turn T, position is y_T.\n\nI choose action a_T, which determines delta y for the move to y_{T+1}.\n\nSo after action a_T, I move to y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at the beginning of turn T, for position y_T.\n\nThe problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but not Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut since at turn T, you are on y_T, not y_{T+1}, so cars on y_{T+1} don't matter at turn T.\n\nOnly the row you are currently on matters.\n\nSo at turn T, you are on row y_T, and collision if car on that row has 0 in span at T.\n\nNow, for the move: if you move vertically, at turn T you are on y_T, and you go to y_{T+1} at next turn.\n\nBack to the path.\n\nStart: turn 15, y=6.\n\nI want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nOption 1: Go up directly.\n\nAt turn 15, I am at y=6. Since row 6 safe, I can choose to go up, down, or stay.\n\nIf I go up (a_{15} = U), then at turn 16, I will be at y=7.\n\nNow at turn 16, y=7, which is row 7.\n\nBut row 7 has collision at T=16, as we saw earlier.\n\nAt T=16, for row 7, 0 in span of third car? Earlier: for row 7, at u=1 (T=16), third car has span [-5,6], which includes 0, so yes, collision if on row 7 at T=16.\n\nSo if I go to y=7 at turn 16, I collide.\n\nTherefore, I cannot go directly up at turn 15.\n\nI could stay at y=6 for turn 15.\n\nAt turn 15, y=6 safe.\n\nIf I stay, a_{15}=S, then at turn 16, I am still at y=6.\n\nThen at turn 16, I can choose action.\n\nAt turn 16, y=6, safe.\n\nIf I go up, to y=7 at turn 17.\n\nAt turn 17, y=7, is there collision?\n\nFor row 7, we saw that at u=2 (T=17), no collision, since at u=2, no car has 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 at u=2, no collision.\n\nT=17 is u=2.\n\nt_1=15, u= T - 15.\n\nT=17, u=2.\n\nRow 7 at u=2: earlier, no collision, as we saw.\n\nSimilarly row 8.\n\nSo at turn 17, if I am on row 7, safe.\n\nThen I can go to row 8 at turn 18.\n\nAt turn 18, y=8, u=3.\n\nRow 8 at u=3: let's confirm.\n\nFor row 8, same as row 7, cars.\n\nAt u=3, first car: [31+18,42+18]= [49,60] no\n\nSecond car: [-47+18, -36+18]= [-29,-18] no\n\nThird car: [-11+18, 18]= [7,18] no, 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen from y=8 at turn 18, I can go up to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nAt turn 19, y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision, and I reached (0,9).\n\nNow, turns: start turn 15, y=6.\n\nAction at 15: S (stay), so at turn 16, y=6\n\nAction at 16: U (up), to y=7 at turn 17\n\nAction at 17: U, to y=8 at turn 18\n\nAction at 18: U, to y=9 at turn 19\n\nSo at turn 19, position (0,9).\n\nH = number of turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, I think.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe player reaches at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, actions: turn 15: S\n\nturn 16: U\n\nturn 17: U\n\nturn 18: U\n\nThen at turn 19, y=9, so we stop, H=4 turns? Let's see.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so t=0: turn t_1, t=1: turn t_1+1, ..., t=H-1: turn t_1 + H -1\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nHere, from turn 15 to turn 18: we have actions at 15,16,17,18.\n\nAfter action at 18, we go to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nSo turn 19 is when we are at (0,9), which is turn t_1 + 4, since t_1=15, 19=15+4.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =19, t_1=15, so 15 + H -1 =19, so H-1=4, H=5?\n\nI think I need to define H properly.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter executing a_{t_1 + t}, we have y_{t_1 + t +1} or something.\n\nAt the start of turn t_1, we are at position (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,6)\n\nThen we choose a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, we are at y_{t_1 +1}, choose a_{t_1 +1}, and so on, until we reach y=9.\n\nWhen we reach y=9, that turn we are done.\n\nSo the turn when we are at y=9 is the end.\n\nFor that turn, we don't need an action if we are already there, but since we choose action at each turn until we reach, I think we stop when we are at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we need actions until the turn before we reach.\n\nLet's see the answer format: it shows actions for turn t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to the last action before reaching or when reaching?\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at (0,9).\n\nAnd the actions are from t_1 to t_1 + H -2? No.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times: t_1 + 0, t_1 +1, ..., t_1 + (H-1)\n\nAfter executing these H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H, but we need to be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAnd the actions are applied: at turn t_1 + t, we apply a_{t_1 + t}, which moves us to y_{t_1 + t +1}? No.\n\nThe state: at turn T, position y_T.\n\nWe choose action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy based on a_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nSo, at turn t_1, we are at y_{t_1} =6.\n\nWe choose a_{t_1}, then y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy.\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, we are at y_{t_1 +1}, choose a_{t_1 +1}, etc.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThat means at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9.\n\nThe actions are chosen from t_1 to t_1 + H -2? Let's see.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at turn K, we need to have arrived there by the action at turn K-1.\n\nSet K = t_1 + H -1, so at turn K, y_K =9.\n\nTo achieve y_K=9, we must have chosen action at turn K-1 such that y_K = y_{K-1} + Δy, with Δy based on a_{K-1}.\n\nAnd y_{K-1} must be 8 or 9, but since we are moving to 9, y_{K-1}=8, and a_{K-1}=U.\n\nIf we were at 9 earlier, we could stay, but we want to reach at K.\n\nThe actions include up to a_{K-1}, since at turn K, we are already at y=9, so no action needed or we don't move.\n\nIn the sequence, actions are from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo the actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2} determine the moves to y_{t_1 +1} to y_{t_1 + H -1}, and at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9, so we don't need to choose an action for that turn, I think, or we might choose S, but since we are at goal, it should be fine.\n\nIn the action sequence, for turn t_1 + H -1, if we are at y=9, we might not need to do anything, but the sequence includes it, so probably we specify the action for that turn as well, but since we are already at 9, we can choose S or something.\n\nBut to minimize H, we want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nBack to the plan.\n\nIn my earlier plan: at turn 15 (t_1), y=6.\n\nI choose S, so y_{16} =6 (since stay)\n\nThen at turn 16, y=6, I choose U, so y_{17} =7\n\nThen at turn 17, y=7, I choose U, so y_{18} =8\n\nThen at turn 18, y=8, I choose U, so y_{19} =9\n\nNow, at turn 19, y=9.\n\nSo y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{15 + H -1} = y_{19} =9, so 15 + H -1 =19, thus 14 + H =19, H=5.\n\nH-1=4, H=5.\n\nThe actions are for t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t_1 + t for t=0 to 4? t=0 to H-1=4.\n\nt=0: turn 15, a_{15}\n\nt=1: turn 16, a_{16}\n\nt=2: turn 17, a_{17}\n\nt=3: turn 18, a_{18}\n\nt=4: turn 19, a_{19}? But at turn 19, we are at y=9, so if we choose an action, it might move away, but we need to be at 9 at turn 19.\n\nIn this case, at turn 19, we are at y=9, so we can choose S to stay, or no action, but the sequence includes up to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nSince we are at 9 at turn t_1 + H -1, we can set a_{t_1 + H -1} = S.\n\nIn the sequence above, for turn 19, we can set a_{19} = S, but since we are already at 9, and it's the goal, it might be redundant, but we need to specify.\n\nTo avoid extra actions, we should reach at turn 19 with the last action.\n\nIn this path, with actions at turn 15: S, turn 16: U, turn 17: U, turn 18: U, we arrive at y=9 at turn 19.\n\nSo for turn 19, we don't need an action, but the sequence must include actions until we reach.\n\nThe minimal H should have us reach at turn t_1 + H -1 with y=9, and the actions are from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor turn t_1 + H -1, since we are at 9, we set a to S.\n\nBut in this case, for H=5, actions at turn 15,16,17,18,19.\n\nAt turn 15: S, to y=6 at turn 16? No.\n\nAt turn 15: after action, we move to next turn.\n\nTimeline:\n\n- Start turn 15: position y=6\n\n- Choose a_{15}: S → y_{16} =6\n\n- Turn 16: position y=6\n\n- Choose a_{16}: U → y_{17} =7\n\n- Turn 17: position y=7\n\n- Choose a_{17}: U → y_{18} =8\n\n- Turn 18: position y=8\n\n- Choose a_{18}: U → y_{19} =9\n\n- Turn 19: position y=9\n\nNow, we are at y=9 at turn 19, which is t_1 +4, since 15+4=19.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =19, t_1=15, so 15 + H -1 =19, H-1=4, H=5.\n\nThe sequence has actions from t=0 to 4: a_{15}, a_{16}, a_{17}, a_{18}, a_{19}\n\nBut at turn 19, we are at y=9, so we need to choose a_{19}, which should be S to stay, or we don't move, but since we are at goal, S is fine.\n\nIn the action list, for turn 19, a_{19}=S.\n\nBut in terms of reaching, we are already there at turn 19 before choosing action, I think.\n\nBut the position is at the start of turn, I believe.\n\nThe collision is checked at the start of turn.\n\nAt start of turn T, position y_T.\n\nThen we choose action a_T, move to y_{T+1}.\n\nFor turn T, we are at y_T at the beginning.\n\nIn this case, at turn 19, start, y=9, we are at goal.\n\nThen we can choose a_{19}=S, and y_{20}=9, but we don't care.\n\nSince we reached at turn 19, we stop, so the last action is at turn 18 to move to 9.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to include up to when we are at 9.\n\nAccording to the problem, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, and actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nFor turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9, so a_{t_1 + H -1} can be S.\n\nIn the minimal sequence, we can have fewer actions if we reach earlier.\n\nIn this path, H=5, from turn 15 to 19.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we go directly up at turn 15: a_{15}=U, then y_{16}=7\n\nBut at turn 16, y=7, and row 7 has collision at T=16, so we collide, not possible.\n\nGo down? But y=5 is safe, but that takes longer to reach 9.\n\nNot better.\n\nAt turn 15, go up to 7? But at turn 15, if I go up, I go to y=7 at turn 16, but at turn 16, y=7, which is bad.\n\nAt turn 15, I am at y=6, if I choose U, I move to y=7 at turn 16.\n\nBut at turn 15, I am at y=6, which is safe.\n\nThe collision at turn 16 is when I am on row 7 at turn 16.\n\nSo I cannot be on row 7 at turn 16.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on row 7 at turn 15? At turn 15, if I were on row 7, but I start at row 6.\n\nAt turn 15, I am at row 6.\n\nIf I want to be at row 7 at some turn, I need to avoid the bad times: T=15,16,21,22.\n\nT=15: u=0, T=16:u=1, T=21:u=6, T=22:u=7.\n\nGood times for row 7: u=2,3,4,5,8,etc.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 faster.\n\ny=9 can be reached from y=8 by going up.\n\ny=8 must be reached at some turn when it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=8, avoid T=15,16,21,22.\n\nNow, current turn 15, y=6.\n\nI can go to y=7 at a good time.\n\nFor example, at turn 17 (u=2), row 7 is safe.\n\nSo if I can be at y=7 at turn 17.\n\nTo be at y=7 at turn 17, I need to arrive there from turn 16.\n\nThat is, at turn 16, I am at some y, and I choose action to go to y=7 at turn 17.\n\nSo y_{17} =7.\n\nSimilarly, y_{17} = y_{16} + Δy from a_{16}.\n\ny_{16} must be 6,7, or 8, but since going to 7, y_{16} should be 6 or 8? If y_{16}=6, a_{16}=U to y=7; if y_{16}=7, a_{16}=S; if y_{16}=8, a_{16}=D to y=7.\n\nBut y=7 at turn 16 is bad, so I cannot be at y=7 at turn 16, so y_{16} cannot be 7.\n\nThus, to have y_{17}=7, I must have y_{16}=6 or 8, and a_{16}=U or D accordingly.\n\nNow, at turn 15, I am at y=6.\n\nI can choose a_{15}:\n\nIf a_{15}=S, then y_{16}=6\n\nThen at turn 16, y=6, I can choose a_{16}=U, to y_{17}=7\n\nAs in the first plan.\n\nIf a_{15}=U, then y_{16}=7, but at turn 16, y=7, collision, not possible.\n\nIf a_{15}=D, then y_{16}=5, then at turn 16, y=5, which is safe, then I can go to y=6 or to y=7, but to go to y=7 at turn 17, I need from y_{16}, if y_{16}=5, I can go U to y=6 or U twice, but to y=7 at turn 17, from y=5, I need to go up twice, but in one step? No, each action changes by at most 1.\n\nFrom y=5 at turn 16, if I go U, to y=6 at turn 17, then at turn 17, y=6, not 7.\n\nIf I want y_{17}=7, I need to be at y=6 or 7 or 8 at turn 16.\n\nBut y=7 at turn 16 bad, so only y=6 or 8 at turn 16.\n\ny=8 at turn 16: but turn 16 is bad for row 8, since same as row 7, collision at T=16.\n\nSo at turn 16, I cannot be on row 7 or 8.\n\nThus, the only possibility for y_{17}=7 is to have y_{16}=6 and a_{16}=U.\n\ny_{16}=6 is safe.\n\nNow, y_{16}=6 can be from previous.\n\nAt turn 15, y=6, if I choose S, y_{16}=6.\n\nIf I choose D, y_{16}=5, then at turn 16, y=5, then I can go to y=6 at turn 17, not to 7 directly.\n\nSo to be at y=7 at turn 17, I must have y_{16}=6 and a_{16}=U.\n\nAnd y_{16}=6 must come from turn 15 with a_{15} such that y_{16}=6, so a_{15}=S, since if U, y=7, if D, y=5.\n\nSo only by staying at turn 15, I can go to y=7 at turn 17.\n\nThen similarly, from y=7 at turn 17, I can go to y=8 at turn 18.\n\nAt turn 17, y=7, safe (since u=2).\n\nThen a_{17}=U, to y_{18}=8.\n\nAt turn 18, y=8, which is safe? u=3, T=18, t_1=15, u=3.\n\nRow 8 at u=3: as before, no collision.\n\nThen a_{18}=U, to y_{19}=9.\n\nSo same as before.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, at turn 18, y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at turn 18.\n\nThen y_{18}=9.\n\nThis must come from y_{17} and a_{17}.\n\ny_{17} must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_{17}=8, a_{17}=U to y=9.\n\nIf y_{17}=9, a_{17}=S.\n\nBut we want to reach at turn 18, so y_{17} should be 8.\n\nNow, y_{17}=8 must be at a safe time.\n\nTurn 17, u=2, row 8 safe, as above.\n\nSo need y_{17}=8.\n\nHow to get to y=8 at turn 17.\n\ny_{17}=8 from y_{16} and a_{16}.\n\ny_{16} must be 7,8,9.\n\nBut at turn 16, y=7 or 8 is bad, collision.\n\ny=9 is not freeway, but at turn 16, if I were at y=9, I could stay or go down, but to go to y=8, I need to be at y=9 or something.\n\ny_{17}=8 can be from:\n\n- y_{16}=7, a_{16}=D? But y=7 to 8 is up, not down.\n\ny_{17} = y_{16} + Δy\n\nIf y_{16}=7, a_{16}=U, y_{17}=8\n\nIf y_{16}=8, a_{16}=S, y_{17}=8\n\nIf y_{16}=9, a_{16}=D, y_{17}=8\n\nBut at turn 16, y=7 or 8 is not possible because collision.\n\ny=9 at turn 16 is possible only if I arrived earlier, but I start at y=6 at turn 15, so at turn 16, I cannot be at y=9.\n\nMinimum, from y=6, to y=9 takes at least 3 turns: to 7,8,9.\n\nBut at turn 16, I can be at most at y=7 if I go up once.\n\nBut y=7 at turn 16 bad.\n\nIf I stay or down, lower.\n\nSo at turn 16, possible y: if a_{15}=S, y_{16}=6; if U, y=7 (bad); if D, y=5.\n\nSo only y=5 or 6 at turn 16.\n\nThen from there, to y=8 at turn 17: if y_{16}=5, I can go U to y=6 at turn 17; or if y_{16}=6, I can go U to y=7 at turn 17.\n\nCannot reach y=8 at turn 17 directly.\n\nBecause from y=5 or 6, after one action, y=4,5,6,7, not 8.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 at turn 17.\n\nThus, cannot reach y=9 at turn 18.\n\nEarliest possible is turn 19 with y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have H=5, with actions.\n\nBut in that sequence, we have to stay at turn 15 to avoid going to 7 at 16.\n\nIs there a way with H smaller?\n\nH=4: y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{15 +4 -1} = y_{18} =9.\n\nIs it possible to be at y=9 at turn 18?\n\nThen as above, need y_{17}=8 and a_{17}=U.\n\nBut y_{17}=8 requires at turn 16 to be at y=7 or 8 or 9, but none possible at turn 16 except y=5 or 6.\n\nCannot have y=8 at turn 17.\n\nIf I go directly to higher, but no, step by step.\n\nAnother idea: go to row 5 or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I go down to 5, then up, but y=5 to 9 takes more steps.\n\nNot faster.\n\nSo minimum H=5 to reach at turn 19.\n\nBut in the action sequence, with H=5, actions at turn 15,16,17,18,19.\n\nBut at turn 19, we are at y=9, so we can set a_{19}=S.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 15: S, turn 16: U, turn 17: U, turn 18: U, turn 19: S.\n\nBut we reached at turn 19, so the last action is redundant, but necessary for the sequence.\n\nSince we reach at turn 19, and we need to be there at t_1 + H -1=19, H=5.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn 18 with a different path.\n\nFor example, from y=6 at turn 15, go down to y=5 at turn 16? But then I am lower.\n\nAt turn 16, y=5, safe.\n\nThen at turn 16, go up to y=6 at turn 17.\n\nThen at turn 17, go up to y=7 at turn 18.\n\nThen at turn 18, go up to y=9? No, to y=8.\n\ny_{18}=8 if a_{17}=U from y=7.\n\nThen at turn 18, y=8, then a_{18}=U to y_{19}=9, same as before.\n\nBut I reached y=9 at turn 19 still.\n\nAnd I used an extra move down, so worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nGo up at later time.\n\nBut since rows 2-6 are always safe, I can stay on them.\n\nBut to reach 9, I need to pass through 7 and 8 at safe times.\n\nThe safe times for row 7 and 8 are after u=2, i.e., turn 17 and later, except u=6 and u=7 which are bad at T=21,22.\n\nBut T=21,22 are later.\n\nSince I am at turn 15, I can go at turn 17 to 7, etc.\n\nBut turn 17 is the earliest I can be on row 7 safely.\n\nThen to 8 at 18, to 9 at 19.\n\nCan I be on row 8 at turn 17?\n\nIf I can, then to 9 at 18.\n\nBut to be on row 8 at turn 17, I need to be at row 7,8,9 at turn 16.\n\nBut at turn 16, row 7 and 8 are bad, row 9 not possible.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nThus, minimal H is 5, reaching at turn 19.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have actions.\n\nBut at turn 17, when I go to y=7, it is safe, and similarly for 8 at 18.\n\nBut what about the later bad times? T=21 and 22, but since I pass at 17 and 18, which are before, no issue.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but we analyzed.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 15, if I stay, I am on row 6, which has no car at 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut let me confirm if row 6 has any car.\n\nFreeway 6: only one car (42,31,right,6), which is always away, so no.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nNow, but in freeway 7 and 8, at T=17, u=2, no collision.\n\nT=17, u=2, row 7: as before, no car at 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 15: S (stay at y=6)\n\nTurn 16: U (to y=7 at next turn? Action at turn T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = S\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +2: a_{t_1 +2} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +3: a_{t_1 +3} = U\n\nThen for turn t_1 +4, since H=5, we need a_{t_1 +4}, but at turn t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +4, we are at y=9, so a_{t_1 +4} = S\n\nt_1 + H -1 =15 +5-1=19, so at turn 19, we set a_{19}=S.\n\nIn terms of the sequence index.\n\nH=5, actions for t=0 to 4: a_{15}, a_{16}, a_{17}, a_{18}, a_{19}\n\nWith a_{15}=S, a_{16}=U, a_{17}=U, a_{18}=U, a_{19}=S\n\nBut a_{19}=S is after we are at 9.\n\nSince we reach at turn 19, and it is t_1 + H -1, we must include the action for that turn, I think.\n\nTo save an action, but H is the number of turns, including the starting point? No.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so the turn when we are at 9 is included.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence where we don't have the extra stay.\n\nFor example, if we reach at turn 18, but we cannot.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=8 directly from y=6? No, must go through 7 or step by step.\n\nCannot jump.\n\nSo I think H=5 is minimal.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach at turn 19 with fewer actions, but from above, with 4 actions: a_{15}, a_{16}, a_{17}, a_{18}\n\nWith a_{15}=S, y_{16}=6\n\na_{16}=U, y_{17}=7\n\na_{17}=U, y_{18}=8\n\na_{18}=U, y_{19}=9\n\nSo at turn 19, y=9, which is t_1 +4, so t_1 + H -1 =19, 15 + H -1=19, H-1=4, H=5.\n\nThe actions are up to a_{18}, which is the fourth action, but we need five actions including a_{19}.\n\nThe sequence has H actions: from t=0 to H-1, so H elements.\n\nIn this case, with four actions, we arrive at turn 19, but we need to specify a_{19} as well.\n\nPerhaps set a_{19}=S.\n\nBut in the position, at turn 19, we are at y=9, so a_{19}=S is fine.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nTo avoid the extra action, but I think we have to.\n\nAnother path: suppose I go up at turn 15 to y=7, but at turn 16, y=7, collision, not possible.\n\nOr, I can go to another row.\n\nFor example, at turn 15, go down to y=5, but that takes longer.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo I think H=5 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nBut turn 19 is t_1 +4.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed.\n\nPerhaps I can not include the last S, but according to the problem, I need the sequence until t_1 + H -1.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so for that turn, we need an action.\n\nSince we are at 9, we set S.\n\nIn some contexts, the action might not be needed, but here I think we specify.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, at T=17 and 18, u=2 and u=3, safe.\n\nBut let me double-check row 8 at u=3.\n\nt_1=15, u=T-15.\n\nT=18, u=3.\n\nRow 8 cars:\n\nFirst car: (42,31,right,6), span at u=3: [31+18,42+18]= [49,60] no\n\nSecond car: (-36,-47,right,6), span: [-47+18, -36+18] = [-29,-18] no\n\nThird car: (0,-11,right,6), span: [-11+18, 0+18] = [7,18] no, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for row 7 at u=2: T=17, u=2\n\nFirst car: [31+12,42+12]=[43,54] no\n\nSecond: [-47+12,-36+12]=[-35,-24] no\n\nThird: [-11+12,12]=[1,12] no, 0 not in.\n\nAt u=1, T=16, third car has [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nBut we avoid that.\n\nNow, what about row 1? We have collision only at T=16, but we don't go there, so fine.\n\nIn this sequence, we don't go to row 1.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut the player starts at y=6, and we stay, then go up.\n\nPerhaps I can go up immediately to a safe row, but row 7 is not safe at turn 16.\n\nAnother thing: since rows 2-6 are always safe, I could, for example, go to row 5 or something, but no benefit.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output in the box.\n\nBut the current turn is t_1=15, so:\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nBut turn 19 is t_1 +4, and since H=5, t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +4=19.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1+4.\n\nt_1 to t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +4.\n\nYes.\n\nTo write in the format.\n\nBut in the action for turn 19, S is not necessary, but I think we include it.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 4 if we reach earlier, but we cannot.\n\nH=4: y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{15+4-1} = y_{18} =9.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at turn 18, need to be at y=8 at turn 17 and go up.\n\nBut at turn 17, to be at y=8.\n\nAs before, impossible because at turn 16, cannot be at y=7 or 8 to reach y=8 at turn 17.\n\nSpecifically, to have y_{17}=8, need y_{16}=7 or 8 or 9, with appropriate action.\n\nBut at turn 16, y=7 or 8 impossible, y=9 not reachable from y=6 in one step (turn 15 to 16, y from 6 to at most 7).\n\nSo y_{16} <=7, so y_{17} <=8, but y_{17}=8 only if y_{16}=7 and a_{16}=U, but y_{16}=7 at turn 16 collision.\n\nOtherwise, if y_{16}=6, y_{17}=7 max.\n\nSo cannot have y_{17}=8.\n\nThus, impossible to be at y=9 at turn 18.\n\nHence, minimal H=5.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 7 and 8, there is a car (0,-11,right,6), which at u=0 has span [-11,0], including 0, so at T=15, if on row 7 or 8, collision.\n\nBut we are not on it at that time.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think fine.\n\nSo the minimal sequence of actions.\n\nIn the sequence, I have five actions, but the first one is stay, which might seem wasteful, but necessary to avoid collision.\n\nI could go down, but not better.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 15\\) and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Collisions\nThe collision times for each freeway are determined based on the car positions and movements relative to \\(t_1 = 15\\):\n\n- **Freeway 1**: Collision only at turn 16 (\\(u = 1\\)).\n- **Freeways 2-6**: No collisions at any turn, as the cars never occupy position 0.\n- **Freeway 7**: Collisions at turns 15 (\\(u = 0\\)), 16 (\\(u = 1\\)), 21 (\\(u = 6\\)), and 22 (\\(u = 7\\)).\n- **Freeway 8**: Collisions at turns 15 (\\(u = 0\\)), 16 (\\(u = 1\\)), 21 (\\(u = 6\\)), and 22 (\\(u = 7\\)).\n\nThe player must avoid being on freeways 7 or 8 at the collision times listed above. Freeways 2-6 are always safe, and \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway, so it is safe.\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9)\nThe goal is to reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible. The direct path upward from \\(y = 6\\) is blocked at turn 16 due to collisions on freeway 7. Therefore, the player must delay moving to freeway 7 until turn 17, when it is safe.\n\n- At turn 15 (\\(y = 6\\)): The player stays (S) to remain at \\(y = 6\\), which is safe.\n- At turn 16 (\\(y = 6\\)): The player moves up (U) to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 17.\n- At turn 17 (\\(y = 7\\)): Freeway 7 is safe at this turn (no collision), so the player moves up (U) to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 18.\n- At turn 18 (\\(y = 8\\)): Freeway 8 is safe at this turn (no collision), so the player moves up (U) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19.\n- At turn 19 (\\(y = 9\\)): The player has reached the goal and stays (S) to remain at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence takes \\(H = 5\\) turns to reach (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 15 + 5 - 1 = 19\\).\n\n### Minimality of \\(H\\)\n- Reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 18 (\\(H = 4\\)) would require being at \\(y = 8\\) at turn 17. However, being at \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at turn 16 (to reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 17) is impossible due to collisions. Thus, \\(H = 4\\) is not achievable.\n- Alternative paths (e.g., moving downward first) take more turns and are not faster.\n- Therefore, \\(H = 5\\) is the minimal number of turns.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 15\\) to \\(19\\) is as follows:\n\n- Turn 15: S (stay at \\(y = 6\\))\n- Turn 16: U (move to \\(y = 7\\))\n- Turn 17: U (move to \\(y = 8\\))\n- Turn 18: U (move to \\(y = 9\\))\n- Turn 19: S (stay at \\(y = 9\\), goal reached)\n\nThis sequence avoids all collisions:\n- Turn 15: On \\(y = 6\\) (safe).\n- Turn 16: On \\(y = 6\\) (safe); moving to \\(y = 7\\) at next turn.\n- Turn 17: On \\(y = 7\\) (safe at this turn).\n- Turn 18: On \\(y = 8\\) (safe at this turn).\n- Turn 19: On \\(y = 9\\) (not a freeway, safe).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: S \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 16. The player starts at (0,6) and must reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n The grid has freeways at y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically (U: up, D: down, S: stay) and the cars move horizontally.\n\n Important: \n - The player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t (Δy_t: +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S). The player must stay in [0,9].\n - Collision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at that same turn T.\n\n Note: When the player moves from y to y' at turn T, at that turn T the player is still on y. Then at the next turn (T+1) the player will be on y'. So:\n   - At turn T, the player is on row y_T.\n   - If at turn T we do an action that moves to y_{T+1} = y_T + a (which is either the same row or adjacent), then during turn T the player is on row y_T, and at the next turn T+1, the player is on row y_{T+1}.\n\n Therefore, to avoid collision at turn T, we must ensure that if the player is on a freeway row (1-8) at that turn, then the car(s) on that row at turn T do not have a span that includes 0.\n\n Given the car update rules:\n   - Left-moving: [h, τ] at t1 becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] at T.\n   - Right-moving: [τ, h] at t1 becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] at T.\n\n But note: the table gives the state at t1=16.\n\n Let's interpret the car state:\n\n Freeway 1: one car: (0, -11, right, 12) -> this is a right-moving car? But note the representation: \n   For right-moving: at t1, the car's head is at h and tail at τ? Actually, the table says \"head h, tail τ\", but for right-moving the head is the front (which is the larger x) and tail is the back (smaller x). However, the representation in the table for right-moving is given as (head, tail) but note that head should be greater than tail. Here, for freeway1: (0, -11) and direction right. But 0 > -11, so the head is 0 and tail is -11. So the span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-11, 0]? \n\n Actually, the problem states for right-moving: \n   Span(t1) = [τ, h]   -> meaning from tail to head, so the car occupies [τ, h] and moves to the right.\n\n But wait: the table says \"head h, tail τ\", so for a right-moving car, the head is the front (so at the right) and tail at the back (left). So the span at t1 is from τ (left end) to h (right end). So for freeway1: \n   τ = -11, h = 0 -> so the car at t1=16 is from -11 to 0? That means at t1=16, the car on freeway1 covers x from -11 to 0? Then at turn T, the car moves to the right: \n      new_τ = τ + s*(T-16) = -11 + 12*(T-16)\n      new_h = h + s*(T-16) = 0 + 12*(T-16)\n\n So at turn T, the span is [-11 + 12*(T-16), 0 + 12*(T-16)].\n\n But note: the collision condition is that 0 is in the span at turn T. So for freeway1 at turn T, we require:\n   -11 + 12*(T-16) <= 0 <= 0 + 12*(T-16)\n\n Which simplifies to:\n   -11 + 12*(T-16) <= 0   and   0 <= 12*(T-16)\n\n The second inequality: 0 <= 12*(T-16) -> T>=16. So at T=16, the second inequality holds (0<=0) and the first: -11 <=0 -> true. So at T=16, 0 is in the span? \n\n However, note the player is at (0,6) at turn 16. But freeway1 is at y=1, and the player is at y=6. So we are not on freeway1 at turn16 -> no collision.\n\n But we are on freeway6? Actually, the player starts at y=6. Freeway6 is one of the freeways (y=1 to 8). So we are on freeway6 at turn16.\n\n Now, for freeway6: \n   Cars: (48,37,right,6), ... -> actually, the table says for freeway6: only one car? But the table says:\n      Freeway 6: (48,37,right,6)\n\n   So one car: head=48, tail=37, direction=right, speed=6.\n\n   This is a right-moving car. At t1=16, the span is [37,48]. Then at turn T, the car's position is:\n      τ(T) = 37 + 6*(T-16)\n      h(T) = 48 + 6*(T-16)\n\n   We are at x=0. We require that 0 is in [37+6*(T-16), 48+6*(T-16)]? \n      Since 37+6*(T-16) is at least 37 (when T=16) and increases, and 0 is less than 37, so 0 is never in the span? -> safe on freeway6 at turn16.\n\n However, note freeway6 also has two more cars? Wait, the table:\n\n  | 6 | \\((48, 37, right, 6)\\) |   -> only one car.\n\n But freeway7 and 8 have multiple cars.\n\n So at turn16, the player is at (0,6). We are safe because the car on freeway6 does not cover 0.\n\n Now, we need to go to (0,9). We can move up, down, or stay. We must avoid freeways 1-8 when there is a car covering x=0 at that turn.\n\n We are starting at y=6. We want to go up to y=9. The minimal number of moves would be 3 ups: U, U, U. But we have to check for collisions.\n\n Let's plan:\n\n   Turn 16 (current): we are at y=6. We can choose an action that will determine our position at turn17.\n\n   We are required to output actions starting from turn16.\n\n   We need to simulate the next turns and check for collisions.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Let t = 16,17,18,... until we reach y=9.\n\n   At each turn T (>=16), we are at a row y_T. We choose an action a_T (U, D, S) that leads to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T (clamped to [0,9]).\n\n   Then, for the next state, we must check at turn T: if y_T is in [1,8] (freeway), then we must check the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\n   How to check a freeway i at turn T?\n      For each car on freeway i (given at t1=16), compute the span at T:\n        If the car is right-moving: \n            τ(T) = τ_initial + s*(T-16)\n            h(T) = h_initial + s*(T-16)\n            The span is [τ(T), h(T)] (since it's from tail to head, and tail is the left end).\n\n        If the car is left-moving: \n            h(T) = h_initial - s*(T-16)   [head was the front (right end) at t1, so after moving left, the head becomes smaller]\n            τ(T) = τ_initial - s*(T-16)   [tail was the left end at t1, so after moving left, the tail becomes smaller]\n            But note: the problem says for left-moving: [h, τ] at t1 becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. However, the representation in the table for left-moving is not given? Actually, the table only has right-moving cars in this instance.\n\n   In the given state, all cars are right-moving? \n\n   Freeways 1 to 8: \n        Freeway1: one right-moving car: (0,-11,right,12) -> at T: [ -11 + 12*(T-16), 0 + 12*(T-16) ]\n        Freeway2: (48,37,right,6) -> [37+6*(T-16), 48+6*(T-16)]\n        Freeway3: same as freeway2: (48,37,right,6)\n        Freeway4: same\n        Freeway5: same\n        Freeway6: same\n        Freeway7: three cars: \n             (48,37,right,6) -> same as above\n             (-30,-41,right,6) -> [ -41 + 6*(T-16), -30 + 6*(T-16) ]\n             (6,-5,right,6) -> [ -5+6*(T-16), 6+6*(T-16) ]\n        Freeway8: same as freeway7.\n\n   We must check for each freeway that the player is on at turn T, and for every car on that freeway at T, whether 0 is in the car's span.\n\n   Since we start at turn16 at y=6, we check freeway6 at T=16: \n        The car on freeway6: [37+6*(0), 48+6*(0)] = [37,48] -> 0 is not in [37,48] -> safe.\n\n   Now, we choose an action for turn16. We want to go to y=9 as fast as possible, so we prefer U.\n\n   Option 1: at turn16, do U -> then at turn17, we will be at y=7.\n\n   But at turn16: we are at y=6 (freeway6) and we are safe.\n\n   Then at turn17: \n        We are at y=7 (freeway7). We must check freeway7 at T=17.\n\n        For freeway7 at T=17 (so T-16=1):\n          Car1: [37+6*1, 48+6*1] = [43,54] -> 0 not in.\n          Car2: [-41+6*1, -30+6*1] = [-35, -24] -> 0 not in.\n          Car3: [-5+6*1, 6+6*1] = [1, 12] -> 0 not in? [1,12] does not include 0 -> safe.\n\n        Then we can choose U again at turn17 -> at turn18 we are at y=8.\n\n        At turn18: we are at y=8 (freeway8). Check at T=18 (T-16=2):\n          Freeway8 cars (same as freeway7 at t1?):\n             Car1: [37+6*2,48+12] = [37+12,48+12] = [49,60] -> safe.\n             Car2: [-41+12, -30+12] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\n             Car3: [-5+12, 6+12] = [7,18] -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn18, we choose U -> at turn19 we are at y=9. We are done.\n\n        So H = 4? Because we take 3 moves (U at 16, U at 17, U at 18) and then at turn19 we are at y=9? \n        But note: we start at turn16, and we do:\n          Turn16: U -> then at turn17 we are at 7.\n          Turn17: U -> at turn18 we are at 8.\n          Turn18: U -> at turn19 we are at 9.\n\n        And at turn19 we are at 9, which is the goal. So the last action is at turn18, and H=3? \n\n        However, the problem says: we are to provide actions for turns from t1 to t1+H-1, and at the end of these actions, the position is (0,9). \n\n        The state after H actions: at turn t1+H we have the position. But note:\n\n          At turn t1 (16): we are at (0,6). Then we do an action a_16 -> then at turn17 we are at (0,6+Δy_16).\n          Then we do a_17 -> at turn18 we are at (0, y17+Δy17) = (0, 7+Δy17) [if we did U at 16 then y17=7].\n          Then we do a_18 -> at turn19 we are at (0, y18+Δy18).\n\n        We want at turn t1+H: y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\n        Since we start at turn16, we do H actions: at turn16,17,...,16+H-1. Then at turn16+H, we have the position.\n\n        So to be at y=9 at turn16+H, we need H moves? Actually, we start at turn16 at y=6. We do H actions and then at turn16+H we are at y=9.\n\n        Therefore, with 3 moves (H=3), we would be at turn19 (16+3) at y=9.\n\n        But note: we must check the safety at each intermediate turn:\n\n          Turn16: at y=6 -> safe (as above)\n          Turn17: at y=7 -> safe (as above)\n          Turn18: at y=8 -> safe (as above)\n\n        And we don't need to check turn19 because at turn19 we are at y=9 (which is not a freeway, so no car collision).\n\n        So the sequence: \n          Turn16: U\n          Turn17: U\n          Turn18: U\n\n        However, wait: at turn18 we are at y=8? Then we do U at turn18 and then at turn19 we are at y=9. But at turn18 we are still on freeway8? and we must check freeway8 at turn18. We did that and it's safe.\n\n        So minimal H=3.\n\n        But is there a possibility that we can do it in less? 3 is the minimal because we are at 6 and need to get to 9: 3 steps.\n\n        However, let's check if we can do it in 2? \n          We would have to move from 6 to 9 in two moves: that requires two U and then we would be at 8 after the first move (turn17) and then at 9 after the second (turn18). But then at turn18 we are at y=9? \n          Actually: \n             turn16: U -> 7 at turn17.\n             turn17: U -> 8 at turn18.\n             Then we are at 8 at turn18, but we need to be at 9. We need one more U to get to 9 at turn19.\n\n          Alternatively, can we jump? We cannot: we can only move one step per turn.\n\n        So H=3.\n\n        But wait: what if we do a double move? No, we can only do one action per turn.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 3.\n\n        However, we must verify the safety at each turn:\n\n          Turn16: y=6 -> freeway6: car at [37,48] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n          Turn17: y=7 -> freeway7: \n                car1: [43,54] -> safe.\n                car2: [-35,-24] -> safe.\n                car3: [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n          Turn18: y=8 -> freeway8: same as freeway7 at t1? \n                Actually, freeway8 at t1 has the same cars as freeway7? \n                So at T=18 (T-16=2):\n                  car1: [37+12,48+12] = [49,60] -> safe.\n                  car2: [-41+12, -30+12] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\n                  car3: [-5+12,6+12] = [7,18] -> safe.\n\n        So it is safe.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n          Turn 16: U\n          Turn 17: U\n          Turn 18: U\n\n        But note: the problem says the player is at (0,6) at turn16. We are going to output:\n\n          Turn t_1: a_{t_1}   -> which is U for turn16\n          Turn t_1 + 1: U\n          Turn t_1 + 2: U\n\n        And then we have H=3.\n\n        However, let me check freeway7 at T=17 again: \n          The third car: (6,-5,right,6) at t1=16: \n             tail = -5, head=6 -> so at T=17: \n                 tail = -5 + 6*(1) = 1\n                 head = 6 + 6 = 12\n             so the span is [1,12]. 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        And freeway8 at T=18: same calculation.\n\n        But wait, what about freeway1? We are never on freeway1, so we don't care.\n\n        However, what if we decide to go down? We don't want to because that would take longer.\n\n        But note: what if we do an action that moves us to a freeway that becomes unsafe at a future turn? In this case, we are moving up and we are safe at each step.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal sequence is three ups.\n\n        However, let me check the car on freeway1: \n          At T=16: [ -11, 0 ] -> at T=16, the car covers x from -11 to 0. But we are at y=6 -> safe.\n          At T=17: [ -11+12, 0+12 ] = [1,12] -> safe for any freeway1? but we are at y=7 -> not on freeway1.\n\n        So it's fine.\n\n        But wait: what if we try to go faster by moving two steps in one turn? We cannot.\n\n        Alternatively, we might consider staying at some turn to avoid a collision? but we don't need to.\n\n        However, let me check if there is any danger at turn17 or 18? We have:\n\n          Freeway7 at T=17: \n             The third car: [1,12] -> so if we were at freeway7 and x=0 at T=17, we would be safe? because 0 is not in [1,12]. But we are at x=0? Actually, the player is always at x=0. So we require that 0 is not in the span.\n\n          Similarly, freeway8 at T=18: [7,18] -> safe.\n\n        So the plan is safe.\n\n        But wait: the problem says that at turn T, if the player is on a freeway row, then we check the cars on that row. And we are at x=0. So we are only concerned with whether 0 is in the span.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is three consecutive U.\n\n        However, let me check the state at turn18: \n          We are at y=8 at turn18. The freeway8 cars: \n             (48,37,right,6): at T=18 -> [37+6*2,48+12] = [49,60] -> safe.\n             (-30,-41,right,6): [-41+12, -30+12] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\n             (6,-5,right,6): [-5+12, 6+12] = [7,18] -> safe.\n\n        So yes.\n\n        But note: the table for freeway7 and 8 at t1=16 has the same set of cars? \n          Freeway7: (48,37,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6), (6,-5,right,6)\n          Freeway8: same\n\n        So both freeways have the same car configurations? Then the calculation for freeway8 at T=18 is the same as freeway7 at T=17? but with two steps? \n\n        Actually, for freeway8 at T=18: \n          Car1: [37+6*(18-16)=37+12=49, 48+12=60]\n          Car2: [-41+12, -30+12] = [-29,-18]\n          Car3: [-5+12, 6+12] = [7,18]\n\n        So safe.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n          Turn 16: U\n          Turn 17: U\n          Turn 18: U\n\n        But note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1. \n          H=3, so t=0,1,2: \n            t=0: a_{16} = U\n            t=1: a_{17} = U\n            t=2: a_{18} = U\n\n        So the answer format:\n\n          Turn 16: U\n          Turn 17: U\n          Turn 18: U\n\n        However, the problem says \"current turn is t1\" and we are to start at t1. \n\n        But wait: the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\". We have H=3.\n\n        However, let me double-check if we can do it in 2? \n          We start at 6. After two moves: \n            Option: two U: then we would be at 8 at turn18. But we need to be at 9. So we need one more move to get to 9 at turn19.\n\n          Therefore, we need 3 moves.\n\n        So the answer is as above.\n\n        But wait: what if we do a \"down\" then two \"ups\"? That would be longer. So not minimal.\n\n        Alternatively, we could do \"stay\" at some point? That would only increase H.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 3.\n\n        However, let me check if at turn17 on freeway7 we are safe? \n          The third car: (6, -5, right, 6) at t1=16: \n            At T=17: tail = -5 + 6*(1) = 1, head=6+6=12 -> [1,12]. \n          We are at x=0 -> not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        But note: the representation for the car (6,-5) is (head=6, tail=-5). For a right-moving car, the tail is the left end and head the right end. So at T=17, the car is from 1 to 12. So 0 is not covered.\n\n        However, what if the car spans 0 at T=17? \n          We require that the car covers 0? It doesn't.\n\n        But wait: what if we are at freeway7 at T=17 and there is another car that we haven't considered? The table says freeway7 has three cars. We considered all.\n\n        One more: freeway7 at T=17:\n          Car1: (48,37,right,6): [37+6,48+6] = [43,54] -> safe.\n          Car2: (-30,-41,right,6): [-41+6, -30+6] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n          Car3: (6,-5,right,6): [-5+6, 6+6] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        So yes.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is three U moves.\n\n        But wait: what if we consider freeway1 at some turn? We are never on freeway1, so we don't care.\n\n        However, note that if we were to go down to freeway5? we don't need to.\n\n        So we are confident.\n\n        However, let me check freeway1 at turn16: \n          The car: [ -11 + 12*(0), 0+0] = [-11,0]. \n          At turn16, the player is at y=6 -> safe.\n\n        And at turn17: the car moves to [ -11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        And at turn18: [ -11+24, 0+24] = [13,24] -> safe.\n\n        So no issue.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal sequence is three U moves.\n\n        We output:\n\n          Turn 16: U\n          Turn 17: U\n          Turn 18: U\n\n        But note: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". And we are safe at each step.\n\n        However, let me consider if we move up and then what if we are forced to wait? but we are not.\n\n        But wait: what if we do U at 16 and then at turn17 we are at 7, but then we do U at 17 and at turn18 we are at 8, and then we do U at 18 and at turn19 we are at 9. \n\n        The goal is to be at (0,9) at the end of the sequence. The end of the sequence is after the last action, which is at turn18, and then at turn19 we are at 9.\n\n        But the problem says: we are to find a sequence of actions that minimizes H such that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9)? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\n        Let me reread: \n          \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} ... such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\n        So at the turn (t1 + H - 1) we are at y=9.\n\n        How does the indexing work?\n          t = 0: we do action at t1 (which is 16) -> then at turn t1+1 (17) we are at y1 = y0 + a0.\n          ...\n          after the last action (at t1+H-1) we have the state at turn t1+H.\n\n          But wait: the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}\" is the position at the turn after the last action? \n\n        Actually, the player update: \n          At turn t, we are at y_t, and we choose a_t. Then at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\n        The sequence of actions: \n          a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}   (H actions)\n\n          Then the position after these actions is at turn t1+H: y_{t1+H} = ... \n\n        But the problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\n        That would be the position at the turn when we have executed H-1 actions? \n\n        Let me see:\n\n          Start: at turn t1 (16): we are at y_{16} = 6.\n\n          After first action (a_{16}) at turn17: y_{17} = 6 + Δy_16.\n\n          After second action (a_{17}) at turn18: y_{18} = y_{17} + Δy_17.\n\n          After third action (a_{18}) at turn19: y_{19} = y_{18} + Δy_18.\n\n          We want y_{t1+H-1} = 9. \n\n          Here, t1=16, so we want y_{16+H-1}=9.\n\n          We have H=3: then we want y_{16+3-1}=y_{18}=9? \n\n          But in our plan, at turn18 we are at y=8 (because we did two U: from 6 to 7 at turn17, then to 8 at turn18). Then we do the third U at turn18 to get to 9 at turn19.\n\n          So y_{18}=8, not 9.\n\n          Then at turn19: y_{19}=9. So we want y_{16+3}=y_{19}=9. But the problem says we want y_{t1+H-1}=y_{18}=9? \n\n          This is a discrepancy.\n\n        Let me read the problem again:\n\n          \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n          and then: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\n          So the condition is: at turn (t1 + H - 1) the player is at 9.\n\n        How do we interpret the sequence?\n\n          The actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\n          Then the position at turn t1 (before any action) is given (6). \n\n          After the first action (at t1), the position at turn t1+1 is updated.\n\n          After the last action (at t1+H-1), the position at turn t1+H is updated.\n\n          But we require that at turn t1+H-1 the position is 9? \n\n          That would be the position at the turn when we are about to take the last action? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning:\n\n          t=0: a_{t1}   -> action at turn t1\n          t=1: a_{t1+1} -> action at turn t1+1\n          ...\n          t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1} -> action at turn t1+H-1.\n\n        And then the condition: at turn (t1 + H - 1) we are at (0,9). \n\n        But note: the action a_{t1+H-1} is taken at turn t1+H-1. Then the position at that turn (t1+H-1) is the state we are in at the beginning of that turn? \n\n        The problem does not explicitly say, but the update rule is:\n\n          y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t   (after taking action a_t at turn t)\n\n        So at the start of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we take action a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} at the next turn.\n\n        Therefore, at the beginning of turn t1, we are at (0,6). Then we take action a_{16} (U) and then at turn17 we are at 7.\n\n        Then at the beginning of turn17, we are at 7. Then we take action a_{17} (U) and at turn18 we are at 8.\n\n        Then at the beginning of turn18, we are at 8. Then we take action a_{18} (U) and at turn19 we are at 9.\n\n        The condition requires that at turn (t1+H-1) we are at 9. \n\n        We want at turn (16+H-1) to be at 9.\n\n        In our plan, at the beginning of turn16: we are at 6 -> not 9.\n        At the beginning of turn17: 7 -> not 9.\n        At the beginning of turn18: 8 -> not 9.\n        At the beginning of turn19: 9 -> this is turn 16+3 = 19. So we require H such that 16+H-1 = 19 -> H-1 = 3 -> H=4.\n\n        But wait: the condition is that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. So we want turn19 = 16+H-1 -> then 16+H-1=19 -> H=4.\n\n        And then we would require that at the beginning of turn19 we are at 9. \n\n        How do we achieve that? \n\n          We start at turn16: y16=6.\n          We do an action at turn16: U -> then at turn17: y17=7.\n          Then at turn17: do U -> turn18: y18=8.\n          Then at turn18: do U -> turn19: y19=9.\n\n          Then at the beginning of turn19, we are at 9. So we require H such that 16+H-1 = 19 -> H=4.\n\n        But then we have taken 3 actions: at turn16,17,18. So H=4? and the sequence has 4 actions? \n\n        But note: the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, so H actions. \n\n        So we would have to output 4 actions? but we only did 3.\n\n        Alternatively, we might need to do an extra action? \n\n        Let me clarify: \n\n          The problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" -> this means H actions.\n\n          And then we require that at turn t1+H-1 the player is at (0,9). \n\n          But note: after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) the player's position is updated at turn t1+H.\n\n          So the position at turn t1+H-1 is the state BEFORE the action at that turn? \n\n          The problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if ... at turn T\" meaning the entire turn? \n\n          And the update: at turn T, we are at y_T, then we choose a_T, then we move to y_{T+1}.\n\n          Therefore, the condition for collision is checked at the beginning of the turn? or during the turn? \n\n          The problem says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", meaning that during turn T, the player is on y_T.\n\n          So the collision condition is checked at the beginning of the turn? Actually, the problem says \"at turn T\", and the player is on y_T at turn T (the entire turn) until the next turn.\n\n          Therefore, at the beginning of turn T, the player is at y_T and remains there until the action is taken, and then at the next turn the player moves.\n\n          So the condition for collision at turn T is: if y_T is in [1,8] and there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\n          Now, the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). That means at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). \n\n          But note: at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). Then we take an action? But the sequence of actions includes an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\n          However, if the player is already at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to do anything? but the problem requires a sequence of H actions.\n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        Let me reexamine the problem statement:\n\n          \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n          and then: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\n          This suggests that the last action in the sequence is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then immediately after that action, the player's position becomes the next state? \n\n          But then the position at turn t1+H-1 (the state during the turn) is the state BEFORE the action? \n\n        Alternatively, the problem might mean that after the last action, the player is at 9 at the next turn? but then the condition would be at turn t1+H = 9.\n\n        But the problem explicitly says: y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n        After re-thinking, I think there might be an off-by-one. Let us assume that the condition is that at the turn AFTER the last action, we are at 9. \n          Then we would require: \n            After H actions, we are at turn t1+H, and we require y_{t1+H}=9.\n\n          Then for our plan: \n            H=3, then at turn16+3=19, we are at 9.\n\n          And then the condition is met.\n\n          But the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n        Alternatively, the index of the turn might be defined differently.\n\n        Let me look at the example in the problem? There is no example.\n\n        But note: the minimal number of turns H: \n\n          We start at turn16 at y=6.\n\n          We want to be at y=9 as soon as possible.\n\n          The earliest turn we can be at y=9 is turn19? because:\n             turn16: start at 6\n             turn17: 7 (after U at 16)\n             turn18: 8 (after U at 17)\n             turn19: 9 (after U at 18)\n\n          So the first time we are at 9 is at turn19.\n\n          Therefore, if the condition is to be at 9 at turn19, then we require that the last action (which gets us to 9) is taken at turn18, and then at turn19 we are at 9.\n\n          Then the condition in the problem should be that at turn t1+H we are at 9. But the problem says turn t1+H-1.\n\n        Given the confusion, let us assume the problem means that after the sequence of H actions, the player is at (0,9) at the next turn, i.e., at turn t1+H. \n        But then the condition should be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\n        However, the problem explicitly states: y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n        Another possibility: the turns are counted including the starting turn? \n          At turn16: we are at 6.\n          At turn17: we are at 7.\n          At turn18: we are at 8.\n          At turn19: we are at 9.\n\n          We want to be at 9 at turn19. So the turn index for being at 9 is 19.\n\n          How is 19 expressed in terms of H? \n          The sequence of actions starts at turn16 and goes for H actions: \n             actions at turns: 16, 17, ..., 16+H-1.\n          Then the position after these actions is at turn16+H.\n\n          We require turn16+H = 19 -> H=3.\n\n          But then the condition in the problem is: y_{t1+H-1}=y_{16+3-1}=y_{18}=8, not 9.\n\n        So if the problem requires y_{18}=9, then we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn18.\n\n        How can we be at 9 at turn18? \n          We start at 6 at turn16.\n          We must get to 9 by the beginning of turn18.\n\n          That means we need to move from 6 to 9 in two actions: \n            Action at turn16: move from 6 to 7 (U) -> then at turn17: we are at 7.\n            Action at turn17: move from 7 to 8 (U) -> then at turn18: we are at 8.\n\n          We cannot get to 9 in two actions? because we can only move one per action.\n\n          Alternatively, if we do U at turn16 and then U at turn17, we are at 8 at turn18.\n\n          To be at 9 at turn18, we would have to be at 8 at turn17 and then do U at turn17 to get to 9 at turn18.\n\n          But how to be at 8 at turn17? \n            At turn16: we start at 6. We do U at turn16: then at turn17 we are at 7, not 8.\n\n          So it's impossible to be at 9 at turn18.\n\n        Therefore, the condition must be that we are at 9 at turn19, and then the problem likely meant y_{t1+H}=9.\n\n        Given the confusion, let us look at the answer format: it only asks for the actions. And we know we need three U's.\n\n        And the typical interpretation in such problems is that the goal is to be at the desired state at the turn after the last action.\n\n        Moreover, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" and we reach it at turn19.\n\n        And the minimal number of actions is 3.\n\n        So we will output the three U's.\n\n        But to be safe, let me see if there is any other constraint? \n\n        The problem also says: \"minimal number of turns H\". What is H? \n\n        In the answer format, we output actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1, so H is the number of actions.\n\n        And we want to minimize H.\n\n        We found a sequence with H=3.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n          Turn 16: U\n          Turn 17: U\n          Turn 18: U\n\n        And hope that the condition \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\" is a typo and they meant y_{t1+H}=9.\n\n        Alternatively, if the problem insists on y_{t1+H-1}=9, then we must be at 9 at turn18, which is impossible in 2 moves from 6.\n\n        But then what is the solution? We might have to start earlier? but we start at turn16.\n\n        Therefore, I think the problem meant that after the actions, the player is at 9 at the next turn, i.e., at turn t1+H.\n\n        So we proceed.\n\n        However, to cover the possibility that the condition is at the beginning of the last action turn, we might consider an extra action.\n\n        If H=4, then we want to be at 9 at turn16+4-1 = turn19. That is, at the beginning of turn19 we are at 9.\n\n        How to achieve that? \n          We can do three U's as before, and then at turn19 we are at 9. But then at the beginning of turn19 we are at 9. \n          But then the last action would be at turn18, and then at the beginning of turn19 we are at 9.\n\n          So the actions would be:\n            Turn16: U\n            Turn17: U\n            Turn18: U\n\n          and then we are at 9 at the beginning of turn19.\n\n          But the sequence has only three actions, so H=3, but then the condition requires turn16+3-1= turn18 to be at 9 -> which is not.\n\n        If we do four actions:\n          Turn16: S (stay) -> then at turn17: still at 6.\n          Turn17: U -> turn18: 7.\n          Turn18: U -> turn19: 8.\n          Turn19: U -> turn20: 9.\n\n          Then at the beginning of turn20, we are at 9. \n          But the condition: at turn16+4-1 = turn19, we are at 8, not 9.\n\n        Alternatively, we can try to get to 9 by turn19 (beginning of turn19) with four actions? \n          That is, we need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn19 = turn16+3.\n          How? \n            turn16: U -> turn17: 7.\n            turn17: U -> turn18: 8.\n            turn18: U -> turn19: 9.  -> so at the beginning of turn19, we are at 9? \n            But then we took three actions: at turn16,17,18. So H=3, and then at turn19 (which is 16+3) we are at 9.\n\n          But the condition requires at turn16+H-1 = 16+3-1=18 to be at 9? -> we are at 8 at the beginning of turn18.\n\n        This is messy.\n\n        Given the time, I will output the three U's as the minimal action sequence that gets us to 9 at turn19.\n\n        And note that the problem might have a off-by-one error in the condition.\n\n        We output:\n\n          Turn 16: U\n          Turn 17: U\n          Turn 18: U\n\n        and hope.\n\n        If the problem truly requires the player to be at 9 at turn18, then it is impossible and we must wait, but that would be more than 3 actions.\n\n        But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the actions. So if it is impossible in 3, then we must do more.\n\n        However, it is not impossible in 3 actions to get to 9 at turn19, and it is the minimal.\n\n        Therefore, we go with three U's.\n\n        Final answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) at turn 16 and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe minimal sequence requires 3 actions (H=3) to reach the goal:\n- At turn 16, moving up (U) from y=6 to y=7 at turn 17.\n- At turn 17, moving up (U) from y=7 to y=8 at turn 18.\n- At turn 18, moving up (U) from y=8 to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nCollision checks:\n- **Turn 16 (y=6)**: The car on freeway 6 has span [37, 48] at T=16 (since T-16=0). 0 ∉ [37, 48] → safe.\n- **Turn 17 (y=7)**: Cars on freeway 7:\n  - (48,37,right,6): span [37+6(1), 48+6(1)] = [43, 54] → 0 ∉ [43, 54]\n  - (-30,-41,right,6): span [-41+6(1), -30+6(1)] = [-35, -24] → 0 ∉ [-35, -24]\n  - (6,-5,right,6): span [-5+6(1), 6+6(1)] = [1, 12] → 0 ∉ [1, 12]\n  All safe.\n- **Turn 18 (y=8)**: Cars on freeway 8 (same as freeway 7 at T=16):\n  - (48,37,right,6): span [37+6(2), 48+6(2)] = [49, 60] → 0 ∉ [49, 60]\n  - (-30,-41,right,6): span [-41+6(2), -30+6(2)] = [-29, -18] → 0 ∉ [-29, -18]\n  - (6,-5,right,6): span [-5+6(2), 6+6(2)] = [7, 18] → 0 ∉ [7, 18]\n  All safe.\n\nAfter the third action at turn 18, the player reaches y=9 at turn 19, which is not a freeway, so no collision check is needed. The sequence achieves the goal in minimal turns.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 16: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 17: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 18: \\text{U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 17, and the player is at (0,7). We need to get to (0,9) in minimal turns H.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate where the player is).\n\nImportant: The player is considered to be on a freeway at turn T if at that turn they are on that row. When they move, at turn T they are still on the starting row and only move to the next row at turn T+1. Therefore, when moving from row y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T the player is still on row y, and at turn T+1 they are on row y+1.\n\nWe are given the car state at turn t1 (turn 17). Each car is defined by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note that for left-moving cars, the head is the leftmost part? Actually, the problem states:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] and then at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: in the right-moving case, the initial span is given as (head, tail) but the representation in the table is (h, τ). The problem says for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h]. So in the table, the first number is the head? Actually, let me read:\n\nThe table says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nSo for a right-moving car, the head is the front (which is the rightmost part) and the tail is the rear. So the span is [tail, head] for right-moving? Actually, the problem states for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\". So in the table, the first number is h (head) and the second is τ (tail). But for right-moving, the head is the rightmost? Then the span should be [τ, h] meaning from tail to head, with tail < head.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, the head is the leftmost? Then the span is [h, τ] meaning h < τ? But in the update, left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] so if h < τ, then the entire car moves left.\n\nNow, looking at the car state:\n\nFreeway 1: (12, 1, right, 12) -> so this is a right-moving car. At turn 17: span = [1, 12] (since τ=1, h=12). Then at time T, the span becomes [1 + 6*(T-17), 12 + 6*(T-17)]? Wait, speed is 12? Actually, the car has speed s=12. So:\n\nAt turn T: \n  span = [1 + 12*(T-17), 12 + 12*(T-17)]\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] = [1 + 12*(T-17), 12 + 12*(T-17)]\n\nSimilarly, freeways 2 to 6 have one car: (54,43,right,6). So at turn 17: span = [43,54] (because right-moving: [τ, h] = [43,54]). Then at turn T: [43+6*(T-17), 54+6*(T-17)]\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have three cars each. For freeway 7: \n  car1: (54,43,right,6) -> [43+6*(T-17), 54+6*(T-17)]\n  car2: (-24,-35,right,6) -> note: head=-24, tail=-35? Then for right-moving: [τ, h] = [-35, -24]. Then at T: [-35+6*(T-17), -24+6*(T-17)]\n  car3: (12,1,right,6) -> [1+6*(T-17), 12+6*(T-17)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 has the same three cars.\n\nOur goal: we start at row 7 at turn 17. We need to get to row 9. We can only move one row at a time (or stay). So we need to go from 7 to 8 to 9. But we must avoid collisions on rows 7 and 8.\n\nNote: when we are on row 7 at turn T, we must check that the car(s) on freeway 7 do not have a span that includes 0 at turn T. Similarly for row 8.\n\nWe start at row 7 at turn 17. We are about to take an action at turn 17 that will determine our position at turn 18.\n\nPlan: We want to get to row 9 as quickly as possible. The minimal number of moves is 2: \n  Option 1: \n      Turn 17: U -> then at turn 18 we are at row 8.\n      Turn 18: U -> then at turn 19 we are at row 9 -> done in 2 moves (H=2? but note: we start at turn 17 and we take two actions: at turn17 and turn18, and then at turn19 we are at 9. So H=3? because we need H turns? Let me check the problem.\n\nThe problem says: sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that at the end of these actions, at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nAt turn t1 (17) we are at (0,7). Then we take actions for t=0 to H-1: \n  t=0: a_{t1+0} = a17\n  t=1: a_{t1+1} = a18\n  ...\n  and after H actions, the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then at the next turn (t1+H) the position is updated? Actually, the update is: \n      y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at turn t1 (17): we are at y17=7.\nThen we choose a17 -> then at turn 18: y18 = y17 + Δy17.\nThen we choose a18 -> then at turn 19: y19 = y18 + Δy18.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H-1} = 9. \n\nBut note: the position at turn t1 (17) is given. Then after H-1 actions, we are at turn t1+H-1, and we want that position to be 9.\n\nSo after 0 actions (H=1): we are at turn17, position=7 -> not 9.\nAfter 1 action (H=2): we are at turn18. We can get to 8 (if a17=U) or 6 (if a17=D) or 7 (if a17=S) -> not 9.\nAfter 2 actions (H=3): we are at turn19. We can get to 9 from 8 by U, or 7 by S, or 7 by D then U? Actually, we can be at 9 at turn19 if we do two ups: \n  turn17: U -> turn18: 8\n  turn18: U -> turn19: 9\n\nSo minimal H is 3? But wait, what if we do nothing? We are at 7 and need to get to 9: we must go up at least twice.\n\nBut we must check for collisions at the rows we are on at each turn.\n\nAt turn17: we are at row7. We must check row7 at turn17: are we colliding? We look at freeway7 at turn17.\n\nFreeway7 has three cars. We need to check if any car on freeway7 at turn17 has 0 in its span.\n\nCar1: (54,43,right,6) -> at turn17: [43,54] -> 0 not in [43,54] -> safe.\nCar2: (-24,-35,right,6) -> at turn17: [-35,-24] -> 0 not in [-35,-24] -> safe.\nCar3: (12,1,right,6) -> at turn17: [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo at turn17 we are safe at row7.\n\nNow, if we take action U at turn17, then at turn18 we will be at row8. But at turn18, we must check row8 for collision.\n\nBut note: at turn17 we are still on row7, and we are moving to row8. So at turn17 we are on row7 (safe as above). Then at turn18 we are on row8. So we must check row8 at turn18.\n\nFreeway8 at turn18: \n  We are given the state at turn17. We need to compute the state at turn18 (T=18, t1=17, so T-t1=1).\n\nCar1: (54,43,right,6) -> at turn18: [43+6*1, 54+6*1] = [49,60] -> 0 not in [49,60] -> safe.\nCar2: (-24,-35,right,6) -> [-35+6*1, -24+6*1] = [-29, -18] -> 0 not in [-29,-18] -> safe.\nCar3: (12,1,right,6) -> [1+6*1, 12+6*1] = [7,18] -> 0 not in [7,18] -> safe.\n\nSo if we go U at turn17 and then U at turn18, we are at row9 at turn19. And we are safe at row7 (turn17) and row8 (turn18). And we don't need to be on row9? Actually, row9 is the goal and there are no cars (only freeways 1-8 have cars). So we are done.\n\nBut wait, the problem says we need to reach (0,9). At turn19 we are at (0,9). So we take two actions: at turn17 and turn18.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n  Turn 17: U\n  Turn 18: U\n\nand then at turn19 we are at (0,9). So the sequence has two actions, and H=2? \n\nBut the problem says: sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. We have two actions: t=0 (turn17) and t=1 (turn18). So H-1 = 1? Then H=2? But then the last action is at turn17+1 = turn18, and then at the next turn (turn19) we are at 9. The problem says: after the sequence, at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nt1+H-1 = 17 + 2 - 1 = 18. But at turn18, we are at row8 (if we did U at turn17) because:\n  turn17: U -> at turn18: 7+1=8.\nThen at turn18 we do U -> at turn19: 8+1=9.\n\nSo at turn18 we are at 8, not 9. Therefore, we are not at 9 at turn t1+H-1=18.\n\nWe need to be at 9 at the turn after the last action. But the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then the next state is at turn t1+H. We want the position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9? That would mean that we are already at 9 at the moment we take the last action? \n\nBut the update rule: the action at time t affects the position at time t+1.\n\nWe are at turn t1 (17) at position 7. Then we take an action at turn17 that will change the position at turn18. Then we take an action at turn18 that changes the position at turn19.\n\nWe want the position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9. \n\nIf H=3: then we take actions at turn17, turn18, and turn19? But then at turn19 (which is t1+2) we take the last action, and then the position at turn20 would be set. But we want the position at turn19 to be 9? \n\nActually, the position at the turn when we take the action is the one we have from the previous action. \n\nWe start at turn17: position=7.\nWe take action at turn17: then at turn18 we have a new position.\nWe take action at turn18: then at turn19 we have a new position.\nWe take action at turn19: then at turn20 we have a new position.\n\nBut we want at turn t1+H-1 (which is 17+H-1) to be 9.\n\nIf H=3: then we want at turn 17+3-1 = 19 to be 9.\n\nSo we must be at 9 at turn19. How? \n  We start at turn17: 7.\n  At turn18: we can be 6,7,8.\n  At turn19: we must be 9.\n\nSo we must be at 8 at turn18 and then take U at turn18 to get to 9 at turn19.\n\nTherefore, we need two actions: \n  at turn17: U -> then at turn18 we are at 8.\n  at turn18: U -> then at turn19 we are at 9.\n\nSo the sequence is two actions: at turn17 and turn18. Then H=3? because the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, so H=3: t=0,1,2? but we only have two actions? \n\nWait, the problem says: sequence {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. We have two actions: t=0 (a17) and t=1 (a18). Then H-1=1? That would mean H=2. But then the last turn we act is turn18, and we want at turn17+2-1=18 to be 9? But at turn18 we are at 8, not 9.\n\nAlternatively, if H=2, then we act at turn17 (t=0) and then at turn18 (t=1) and then we stop. But at turn18 we are at 8 (if we did U at turn17 and then at turn18 we do nothing? but we must do an action at turn18?).\n\nI think there is a confusion. Let me re-read the problem:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then in the answer format: we list actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... up to the last action.\n\nBut note: we are at turn t1 at position (0, y_{t1}). Then we take actions for the next H-1 turns? Actually, the sequence has H actions? \n\nThe problem says: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions: at turn t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAnd then at the next turn (t1+H) we have the updated position? But we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nThis is inconsistent because the action taken at turn t1+H-1 will only change the position at turn t1+H, so at turn t1+H-1 we are still at the position from the previous action.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem means that after taking the sequence of actions, the position at the end of the sequence (i.e., at the moment after the last action) is (0,9). But note: the position update is delayed.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that the player reaches (0,9) at the turn immediately after the last action? But then that turn is t1+H, and we are not acting at that turn.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1.\n\nTo clarify, let me look at the update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo after taking action a_t at turn t, the new position is at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, to be at 9 at turn T, we must have taken an action at turn T-1 that moved us to 9.\n\nBut the problem says: at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). So we require:\n  y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nHow is this achieved? \n  We start at turn t1: y_{t1} = 7.\n  Then we take a sequence of actions: a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-2} to get to y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nThe number of actions is H-1? Because the sequence is from t=0 to H-1? Actually, the index t runs from 0 to H-1, so we have H actions: \n  a_{t1} (t=0), a_{t1+1} (t=1), ..., a_{t1+H-1} (t=H-1).\n\nBut then the position at turn t1+H-1 is computed by the actions from t1 to t1+H-2? \n\nSpecifically:\n  y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}   [from action at t1]\n  y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy_{t1+1}\n  ...\n  y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy_{t1+H-1}\n\nBut we want y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nNotice that the last action (at t1+H-1) will affect y_{t1+H}, not y_{t1+H-1}. Therefore, to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, the last action we take must be at turn t1+H-2? \n\nBut the sequence includes actions from t1 to t1+H-1. That would be H actions. But the last action (at t1+H-1) is taken when we are at position y_{t1+H-1}=9? Then why take an action? \n\nAlternatively, the sequence of actions is only until we reach the goal. We stop at the turn when we are at 9. But then we don't take an action at that turn.\n\nI think the intended meaning is: we take actions for H turns (from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1) and then after these H actions, the position at the next turn (t1+H) is 9? But the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nLooking at the example: if we start at turn17 at 7, and we do two actions (U at turn17 and U at turn18), then at turn19 we are at 9. So we want to be at 9 at turn19. But 19 = 17+2, so t1+H-1=19 -> 17+H-1=19 -> H=3.\n\nSo we must have H=3. Then the sequence has three actions? But we only need two: at turn17 and turn18. Then what is the third action? \n\nAlternatively, the sequence is for the turns when we act, and we act at the turns we are at a position. But the goal is to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\nWith H=3:\n  We act at turn17 (a17) -> then at turn18 we are at y18 = 7 + Δy17.\n  Then act at turn18 (a18) -> then at turn19 we are at y19 = y18 + Δy18.\n  Then act at turn19 (a19) -> but then at turn20 we get y20.\n\nBut we want y_{17+3-1}=y19=9.\n\nSo we can set:\n  a17: U -> y18=8\n  a18: U -> y19=9\n  a19: ? -> we don't care as long as at turn19 we are at 9.\n\nBut we must take an action at turn19? But then we are already at 9 at turn19. The problem says we must provide a sequence of H=3 actions? But then the last action at turn19 can be anything? But that would be inefficient and we want minimal H.\n\nAlternatively, we can stop after two actions? But the problem requires the minimal H and the sequence for H actions.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". And H is the number of turns we are considering? \n\nI think the intended meaning is that we start at turn t1 and we end at turn t1+H-1, and we take H-1 actions? But the sequence is indexed from t=0 to H-1, which is H actions.\n\nBut then H must be at least 2? because we need to move two steps. \n\nBut to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1, we must have moved two steps: \n  at turn t1: 7\n  at turn t1+1: 8\n  at turn t1+2: 9\n\nSo we need to be at turn t1+2 to be at 9. Therefore, t1+H-1 = t1+2 -> H-1=2 -> H=3.\n\nSo we take 3 actions: at turn t1, t1+1, t1+2 (which are turn17,18,19). Then the position at turn19 (t1+2) is 9.\n\nHow? \n  We start at turn17: y17=7.\n  Action at turn17: we choose a17. Then y18 = 7 + Δy17.\n  Action at turn18: a18. Then y19 = y18 + Δy18.\n  Action at turn19: a19. Then y20 = y19 + Δy19.\n\nBut we want y19=9. So we can do:\n  a17: U -> y18=8\n  a18: U -> y19=9\n  a19: S (or anything) -> but we don't care about y20.\n\nBut we must provide an action for turn19. Since we are at 9 at turn19, we can do S (stay) to remain at 9? But the problem doesn't require that we stay at 9, only that we reach at turn t1+H-1=19.\n\nSo minimal H=3, and the actions are:\n  Turn17: U\n  Turn18: U\n  Turn19: S   (or U? but then we go to 10 which is invalid, so we must do S or D? but D would go to 8. So we must do S to stay at 9.)\n\nBut note: the player position is bounded to [0,9]. If we are at 9 and do U, it should stay at 9? The problem says: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where ... and y_{t+1} in [0,9]\". So it is clipped? The problem doesn't specify clipping. It says \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\". So I think it is enforced to be in that range. But the update rule doesn't say it's clipped. However, the problem states \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\". So if we try to go above 9, it remains at 9? \n\nBut to be safe, we should do S at turn19.\n\nBut is H=3 minimal? We cannot do it in fewer than 3? Because we start at 7 and need to get to 9. The minimal number of moves is 2, but then we would be at 9 at turn19, which is t1+2, so H=3.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it without the third action? The problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. For H=2: then we are at turn17+2-1=18. We want y18=9. How?\n  Start: y17=7.\n  Action at turn17: must get to 9? But we can only move by -1,0,1. So we cannot jump from 7 to 9 in one move. Therefore, H=2 is impossible.\n\nSo minimal H=3.\n\nNow, we must check that during the entire journey, we do not collide.\n\nWe have to check for collisions at the rows we are on at each turn.\n\nWe are at:\n  turn17: row7\n  turn18: row8 (if we go up at turn17 and then at turn18 we go up, but note: at turn18 we are on row8? and then at turn19 we are on row9)\n\nBut we must also check the actions we take and the positions we are at each turn.\n\nSpecifically:\n  At turn17: we are at row7. We take an action (U) that will move us to row8 at turn18. But during turn17, we are on row7. So we check row7 at turn17: safe (as above).\n\n  At turn18: we are at row8. We take an action (U) that will move us to row9 at turn19. During turn18, we are on row8. So we check row8 at turn18: safe (as above).\n\n  At turn19: we are at row9. But row9 is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8), so no cars. We are safe. Then we do S (stay) at turn19, which is safe.\n\nBut what about the movement? The problem says: when moving, at the moment of moving (turn T) we are still on the starting row. So we are never on an intermediate row during the move.\n\nTherefore, the plan is:\n  Turn17: U -> we are at row7 during turn17 (safe) and then at turn18 we appear at row8.\n  Turn18: U -> we are at row8 during turn18 (safe) and then at turn19 we appear at row9.\n  Turn19: S -> we are at row9 during turn19 (safe).\n\nBut we must check row7 at turn17, row8 at turn18, and row9 at turn19. Row9 has no cars, so safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 3, and the actions are:\n  Turn17: U\n  Turn18: U\n  Turn19: S\n\nBut wait, the problem says that if we decide to move at turn T to a different row, we are not considered on the new row until the next turn. So we don't need to check the destination row at the current turn? Only the current row at the current turn.\n\nSo our plan is safe.\n\nBut let me double-check the cars at the required turns.\n\nAt turn17 on row7 (freeway7):\n  Car1: [43,54] -> 0 not in [43,54]\n  Car2: [-35,-24] -> 0 not in [-35,-24]\n  Car3: [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12]\n\nAt turn18 on row8 (freeway8):\n  Car1: [43+6*(18-17)=43+6=49, 54+6=60] -> 0 not in [49,60]\n  Car2: [-35+6, -24+6] = [-29,-18] -> 0 not in [-29,-18]\n  Car3: [1+6,12+6]=[7,18] -> 0 not in [7,18]\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut what if we consider other moves? For example, could we do S at turn17 and then two U's? But that would take H=4? Not minimal.\n\nOr what if we go down? But that would take more moves. So minimal is H=3.\n\nBut wait, what about the cars on other rows? We don't care because we are only on row7 at turn17, row8 at turn18, and row9 at turn19. And row9 is safe.\n\nBut note: the problem says that collision occurs only if we are on a freeway and the car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that turn. So we only check the freeway corresponding to the row we are on at that turn.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: S\n}\n\nBut let me check if we can avoid the third action? The problem requires that we provide a sequence of H=3 actions. And we must take an action at turn19. We choose S to stay at 9.\n\nAlternatively, we could do D at turn19? But then we go to 8, which is not 9. But we already reached 9 at turn19? No, we are at 9 at turn19, and then if we do D at turn19, at turn20 we go to 8. But we don't care about after. However, the requirement is to be at 9 at turn19, which we are. But the action at turn19 is taken while we are at 9. So we can do any action? However, we must not collide. If we do D, we move to 8 at turn20, but during turn19 we are at 9 (safe). Then at turn20 we are at 8? But we are not required to stay at 9. However, the problem only requires to reach (0,9) at turn19. So we can do any action at turn19? But to be safe, we do S.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"avoid collisions\". We must avoid collisions at every turn we are acting. At turn19 we are at row9, which is safe. Then we do S: which means we stay at 9 at turn20? but we don't care about turn20. However, at turn19 we are safe. So we can do S.\n\nAlternatively, we could do U? But then we would try to go to 10, which is not allowed. The problem says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we do U at 9, we remain at 9? The problem does not specify. But to be safe, we do S.\n\nBut let me see the update rule: it says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and then it says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]. So if we try to go above 9, it should be set to 9? \n\nSo we can do U at turn19: then y20 = min(9+1,9)=9? So it stays at 9. Then we are safe at turn19 (row9) and then at turn20 we are at row9? But we don't care. So we could do U as well.\n\nBut to be explicit, we can do S.\n\nSo I'll write S.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=3. Is there a way to do it in H=3 that might be safer? But we are safe.\n\nBut what if the cars move and at turn18 on row8 we are not safe? But we computed: at turn18 on row8, the cars are at [49,60], [-29,-18], [7,18] -> no 0.\n\nBut wait, the car3 on row8 at turn18: [7,18] -> 0 is not in [7,18]. But what if the car spans are continuous? Yes, 0 is not in [7,18]. \n\nBut let me check if at turn19 on row9 we are safe: no cars, so safe.\n\nBut note: we are not on row7 at turn18: we moved to row8 at turn18. And at turn19 we are on row9.\n\nBut what if we consider the possibility that we might have to wait? For example, if at turn18 on row8 we were not safe, then we might have to wait at row7 for one turn and then go. But in this case, we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 3 and the sequence is:\n\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\nTurn19: S\n\nBut let me check if we can do it without the third action? We cannot because H must be 3 to have the position at turn19.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might allow that we stop at the moment we reach 9? But then we wouldn't take an action at that turn. But the problem requires a sequence of H actions, and we must be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. So if we are at 9 at turn19, then H=3 and we take three actions? But the third action is after we have reached? \n\nBut note: at turn17 we are at 7 (not 9) so we take an action. At turn18 we are at 8 (not 9) so we take an action. At turn19 we are at 9: we have reached. But the problem says we must provide an action for turn19? Why? Because the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, and H=3, so we need three actions. We can choose any safe action at turn19.\n\nSo we choose S.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: S\n}\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway1? It has speed 12. At turn17, freeway1: [1,12] -> safe. We are never on freeway1 because we are at row7, then 8, then 9. So we don't care.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 2-6: each has one car: [43,54] at turn17, then moving right. We are not on these rows.\n\nFreeway7 and 8: we checked.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nBut what if we do D at turn17? Then we go to 6. Then we have to go to 7, then 8, then 9: that would take more moves. Not minimal.\n\nSo minimal is the above.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=3. And the sequence is three actions.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\". So we output H=3 and the sequence.\n\nBut the answer format only shows the actions. So we output the actions for turn17,18,19.\n\nOne more thing: the car update rule uses T-t1, and t1=17. So for turn T, we use (T-17).\n\nWe did that correctly.\n\nSo final answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 3, as the player starts at position \\((0, 7)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 17\\) and must reach \\((0, 9)\\) by turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 17 + 3 - 1 = 19\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- At turn 17, move up (U) to reach row 8 at turn 18.\n- At turn 18, move up (U) to reach row 9 at turn 19.\n- At turn 19, stay (S) to remain at row 9, as the goal is achieved at turn 19 and no further movement is necessary.\n\nCollision checks confirm safety:\n- **Turn 17 (row 7):** Cars on freeway 7:\n  - \\((54, 43, \\text{right}, 6)\\): Span at turn 17 is \\([43, 54]\\) → 0 not in span.\n  - \\((-24, -35, \\text{right}, 6)\\): Span at turn 17 is \\([-35, -24]\\) → 0 not in span.\n  - \\((12, 1, \\text{right}, 6)\\): Span at turn 17 is \\([1, 12]\\) → 0 not in span.\n  Safe.\n- **Turn 18 (row 8):** Cars on freeway 8 (computed for \\(T = 18\\), \\(\\Delta T = 1\\)):\n  - \\((54, 43, \\text{right}, 6)\\): Span = \\([43 + 6 \\times 1, 54 + 6 \\times 1] = [49, 60]\\) → 0 not in span.\n  - \\((-24, -35, \\text{right}, 6)\\): Span = \\([-35 + 6 \\times 1, -24 + 6 \\times 1] = [-29, -18]\\) → 0 not in span.\n  - \\((12, 1, \\text{right}, 6)\\): Span = \\([1 + 6 \\times 1, 12 + 6 \\times 1] = [7, 18]\\) → 0 not in span.\n  Safe.\n- **Turn 19 (row 9):** No cars on row 9 (freeways only on rows 1–8), so always safe.\n\nThe actions are:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: S\n}",

Since y=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway (freeways are y=1 to 8), I don't have to worry about cars at y=9. So, to reach (0,9), I just need to be at y=9 at some turn, and since I'm starting at y=8, I can potentially go up to y=9 in one move if I choose action U.\n\nBut I have to make sure that when I move, I don't collide with cars on the freeway I'm on or moving to.

Also, when I move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, I'm not considered to be on y_{T+1} until the next turn, so I only need to worry about the freeway I'm currently on.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t = 18.\n\nPlayer position: (0,8)\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nAction at turn t: if I choose U, then y_{19} = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nBut at turn t=18, I'm on y=8, so I need to check if there is a collision at turn 18 on freeway y=8.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to y=9 at turn 19, since y=9 is not a freeway, no cars, so no collision possible at y=9.\n\nSo the only thing to worry about is whether at turn 18, on freeway y=8, there is a car such that 0 is in its span.\n\nNow, for freeway 8, there are cars: (60,49,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6), (18,7,right,6)\n\nDirection right means right-moving, so according to the update, for right-moving cars, span at time T is [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] where t1 is the initial time, which is 18.\n\nThe car state is given at turn t1=18, so for any turn T, we can compute the span.\n\nFor a car with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s at time t1.\n\nFor right-moving: at time T, span is [tau + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all cars are right-moving.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 8, there are three cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,6) at t1=18\n\nHead is 60, tail is 49? But for right-moving, head should be greater than tail? Let's see the span.\n\nAt time t1=18, span is [tau, h] for right-moving? The notation says: for right-moving, span(t1) = [tau, h], so I think for right-moving, tau is the left end, h is the right end, so tail is left, head is right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head is left, tail is right.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: span(t1) = [h, tau] -> at T, [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\n\nRight-moving: span(t1) = [tau, h] -> at T, [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nFor freeway 8 at t1=18:\n\nFirst car: tau=49, h=60, s=6, right\n\nSo span at T: [49 + 6(T-18), 60 + 6(T-18)]\n\nSecond car: (-18,-29,right,6) so tau=-29? h=-18? That seems odd, but possible.\n\ntau=-29, h=-18, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [ -29 + 6(T-18), -18 + 6(T-18) ]\n\nThird car: (18,7,right,6) tau=7, h=18, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [7 + 6(T-18), 18 + 6(T-18)]\n\nNow, at turn T, collision on freeway k if 0 is in the span for some car on that freeway.\n\nFor us, at turn 18, on freeway y=8, we need to check if 0 is in any of these spans for T=18.\n\nCompute for T=18:\n\nFirst car: [49 + 6(0), 60 + 6(0)] = [49,60], 0 not in [49,60]\n\nSecond car: [-29 + 0, -18 + 0] = [-29,-18], 0 not in [-29,-18] since both negative.\n\nThird car: [7 + 0, 18 + 0] = [7,18], 0 not in [7,18]\n\nSo at turn 18, on freeway 8, no car has 0 in span, so no collision.\n\nTherefore, if I stay at y=8 or move, no issue at turn 18.\n\nBut I want to move to y=9.\n\nIf I take action U at turn 18, then at turn 19, I am at y=9, which is the goal.\n\nDo I need to worry about anything at turn 19? At turn 19, I am on y=9, but y=9 is not a freeway, so no cars, so no collision possible. So I should be able to reach in one turn.\n\nBut the player position is given as (0,8) at turn 18, and I need to reach (0,9).\n\nAction at turn 18: U, then y_{19} = 9.\n\nAnd since at turn 18, I was on y=8, no collision, and at turn 19, on y=9, no issue.\n\nBut the goal is to reach (0,9), which I do at turn 19.\n\nBut turn t1 + H -1 should be when I reach y=9.\n\nSet t = t1 + t for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nt1 = 18.\n\nAt time t1, I am at y=8.\n\nAfter action at t1, I move to new position at time t1+1.\n\nSo if I take action at t1, it affects position at t1+1.\n\nSo to reach y=9 at time t1 + H, I think.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn T, before action, position is y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, position becomes y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nAnd collision is checked at each turn based on y_T.\n\nTo be at (0,9) at some turn, say turn T, meaning y_T = 9.\n\nAnd since actions are taken from t1 to t1+H-1 to reach at t1+H.\n\nStart at t1, position y_{t1} = 8.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, position y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t1+H, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} = 9 for some H.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nIf I do nothing, stay, y remains 8.\n\nIf I go up, U, y_{t1+1} = 9.\n\nIf I go down, D, y_{t1+1} = 7, which is worse.\n\nSo best is to go up immediately.\n\nBut need to check if it's safe.\n\nAt turn t1=18, on y=8, no collision, as we saw.\n\nThen action U at t1, so at turn t1+1=19, I am at y=9.\n\nNo cars at y=9, so safe.\n\nBut is there any reason I cannot do this? The cars are only on freeways 1-8, y=9 is safe.\n\nIn the action sequence, I need to output actions from turn t1 to when I reach.\n\nH is the number of turns, so actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be for turns t1, t1+1, ..., up to when I reach.\n\nBut since I reach in one action, H=1.\n\nThen actions: only one action at turn t1: U.\n\nThen at turn t1+1=19, I am at (0,9).\n\nBut the answer format should be:\n\nTurn 18: a_{18}\n\nSince t1=18.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me confirm the car states.\n\nFor freeway 8, at turn 18, cars: as above, no span contains 0.\n\nMoreover, when I am at y=8 at turn 18, and I move to y=9 at turn 19, at turn 19 I am on y=9, which has no cars.\n\nBut do I need to worry about during the move? The collision is only at the position I am at each turn, not during the move, I think.\n\nThe rule says: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in span for any car on freeway y_T.\n\nAnd when you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and after action, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nSo no intermediate position.\n\nSo for moving from y=8 to y=9 at turn T, at turn T you are on y=8, and collision checked for y=8; at turn T+1 you are on y=9, collision checked for y=9 if it were a freeway.\n\nSo in this case, at turn 18, on y=8, safe; at turn 19, on y=9, safe.\n\nSo I can go directly.\n\nBut why are there other freeways? I don't need to go through them, since I start at y=8 and go to y=9 directly.\n\nBut let me see the car on other freeways, but since I don't go to them, it doesn't matter.\n\nFor example, if I were to move down or something, but I don't.\n\nPerhaps I should check if at y=8, for future turns, but I'm moving away immediately.\n\nAnother thing: the note says that if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will not be considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you won't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm moving at turn 18 to y=9, at turn 18 I am on y=8, so cars on y=9 at turn 18 don't affect me, which is good because y=9 has no cars anyway.\n\nBut for example, if there were a car on y=9 at turn 18, but since I'm not on y=9 at turn 18, it doesn't matter.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 19, I am on y=9, and if there were cars, but no.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me look at freeway 7 and 8, since I'm at y=8.\n\nFreeway 7 has cars too, but since I'm not on y=7, it doesn't affect me.\n\nPerhaps the player might need to move through other rows, but here I start at y=8, goal y=9, so only one move up.\n\nBut y=8 is a freeway, so I need to ensure that at the turn I am on it, no collision.\n\nAt turn 18, no collision.\n\nBut is there a possibility that if I stay, there might be collision later? But I don't stay, I move immediately.\n\nSo for H=1, action U at turn 18.\n\nThen the sequence is just one action.\n\nBut let me see the car list again.\n\nFreeway 8 has three cars: (60,49,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6), (18,7,right,6)\n\nAt T=18:\n\nCar1: [49,60], 0 not in\n\nCar2: [-29,-18], 0 not in\n\nCar3: [7,18], 0 not in\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I should check if at turn 19, but I'm not on y=8 at turn 19, I'm on y=9.\n\nUnless I stay, but I don't.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut why is freeway 7 listed with similar cars? And freeways 1-6 have cars, but I don't care.\n\nFreeway 1: (24,13,right,12) at t1=18\n\nBut y=1, not relevant.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut for freeway 7: cars (60,49,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6), (18,7,right,6)\n\nSame as freeway 8? Let me see.\n\nIn the table:\n\nFreeway 7: (60,49,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6), (18,7,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: same (60,49,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6), (18,7,right,6)\n\nIdentical cars on both? That seems odd, but possible, multiple cars on same freeway.\n\nBut for me, only y=8 matters at turn 18.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to wait or something, but no need.\n\nAnother thought: the goal is to reach (0,9), which is not on freeway, so once I'm there, I'm done.\n\nMinimal H is 1.\n\nBut let me see the car movements to be thorough.\n\nSuppose I take no action, stay at y=8 for turn 18.\n\nThen at turn 19, I am still on y=8, position (0,8) at turn 19.\n\nThen I need to check if at turn 19, on freeway y=8, is there a car with 0 in span.\n\nAt T=19, for freeway 8 cars:\n\nFirst car: [49 + 6(19-18), 60 + 6(1)] = [49+6, 60+6] = [55,66], 0 not in\n\nSecond car: [-29 + 6(1), -18 + 6(1)] = [-23,-12], 0 not in\n\nThird car: [7 + 6(1), 18 + 6(1)] = [13,24], 0 not in\n\nStill no.\n\nAt T=20: [49+12,60+12]=[61,72], no; [-29+12,-18+12]=[-17,-6], no; [7+12,18+12]=[19,30], no.\n\nT=21: [49+18,60+18]=[67,78], no; [-29+18,-18+18]=[-11,0], oh! At T=21, second car span: [-29 + 6(3), -18 + 6(3)] = [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11, 0]\n\nIs 0 in [-11,0]? Well, -11 to 0, inclusive? The span is [left, right], so if it includes both ends, then 0 is included.\n\nCollision if 0 in span, so at T=21, for second car, span is [-11,0], which includes 0, so if I am on y=8 at turn 21, I would collide.\n\nSimilarly, third car at T=21: [7+18,18+18]=[25,36], no.\n\nFirst car [67,78], no.\n\nBut at T=21, if I am on y=8, collision with second car.\n\nBut I don't plan to be there; I am moving away.\n\nIn this case, since I move at turn 18, I am not affected.\n\nEven if I stayed, at turn 19 or 20, no collision yet, but at 21 there is.\n\nBut I don't stay.\n\nSo back to point, with U at turn 18, I reach y=9 at turn 19 safely.\n\nPerhaps I should check if y=9 is reachable directly.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to y=9, at turn 19 I am on y=9, no cars.\n\nBut is there a freeway at y=9? No, freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 is safe.\n\nPerhaps the vertical axis is y=0 to 9, with freeways 1-8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, no cars.\n\ny=0 might have something, but not relevant.\n\nSo I think H=1 is possible.\n\nBut why is the car state given for all freeways? Maybe to trick or for other positions, but here not needed.\n\nPerhaps I misread the player position.\n\nCurrent player position: (0,8) at turn t1=18.\n\nGoal: (0,9)\n\nAction U at turn 18, to (0,9) at turn 19.\n\nMinimal H: since H is the number of turns, I think H=1 action.\n\nThen the sequence: only turn 18: U\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t1: a_{t1}\n\nSo Turn 18: U\n\nBut let me see if S or D is better, but no, U is direct.\n\nPerhaps I need to output for multiple turns, but H=1.\n\nBut the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so one action.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if moving up causes issue, but no.\n\nAnother thought: when I take action U at turn 18, I move to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nAt turn 18, I am on y=8, and no collision.\n\nThe collision is only based on position at integer turns, not during.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 7, but I'm not on it.\n\nUnless I go down, but I don't.\n\nSo I think the minimal H is 1.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway 8 at turn 18.\n\nThird car: (18,7,right,6), at T=18, span [7,18], 0 not in, yes.\n\nAt T=17, for example, but not relevant.\n\nPerhaps the tail and head, for right-moving, tau should be less than h, but here for second car, tau=-29, h=-18, which is fine, tau < h.\n\nSimilarly, first car tau=49, h=60, tau < h.\n\nThird car tau=7, h=18, tau < h.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the action is U at turn 18.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nSo \\boxed{ Turn 18: U }\n\nBut the format says: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nSince t1=18.\n\nIn the sequence, if H=1, only one turn.\n\nBut let me see the example or something, but there is no example.\n\nPerhaps I need to specify the turns.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but at turn 18, all are away from 0.\n\nAnother thing: the third car on y=8, at T=18, [7,18], which is from 7 to 18, so at x=0, not covered, since 0<7.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo yes.\n\nPerhaps I can consider moving down or staying, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=7, then I have to deal with cars on y=7, which might take more time.\n\nBut since I can go directly up, no need.\n\nSo minimal H is 1.\n\nTherefore, the action sequence is just U at turn 18.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 18: U }\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so I think that's it.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbering.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=18.\n\nPlayer at (0,8).\n\nAfter action at turn 18, position at turn 19 is (0,9).\n\nReached.\n\nSo H=1.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that at y=8, if I move up, but I think it's fine.\n\nI think I'm overthinking.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 18\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nAt turn 18, the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The cars on freeway 8 at turn 18 are:\n- Car 1: \\((60, 49, \\text{right}, 6)\\), span at \\(T = 18\\) is \\([49 + 6(18-18), 60 + 6(18-18)] = [49, 60]\\), and 0 is not in \\([49, 60]\\).\n- Car 2: \\((-18, -29, \\text{right}, 6)\\), span at \\(T = 18\\) is \\([-29 + 6(18-18), -18 + 6(18-18)] = [-29, -18]\\), and 0 is not in \\([-29, -18]\\).\n- Car 3: \\((18, 7, \\text{right}, 6)\\), span at \\(T = 18\\) is \\([7 + 6(18-18), 18 + 6(18-18)] = [7, 18]\\), and 0 is not in \\([7, 18]\\).\n\nSince 0 is not in the span of any car on freeway 8 at turn 18, there is no collision at turn 18.\n\nBy taking action \\(U\\) (up) at turn 18, the player moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19. Since \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway (freeways are only \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)), there are no cars, and thus no collision is possible at turn 19.\n\nTherefore, the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 19 with \\(H = 1\\) turn. The minimal sequence of actions consists of a single action at turn 18.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 18: U }",
