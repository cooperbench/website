        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically, and cars move horizontally on their respective rows.\n\nFirst, understand the car movement. All cars are moving right, based on the direction given. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)], since head and tail swap in the notation, I think.\n\nLooking back: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h], and at T, it's [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]. But in the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For example, on freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 6). Head is 48, tail is 37? But if it's right-moving, and head is larger, that makes sense because it's moving right, so head should be to the right.\n\nIn the span notation, for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] meaning from tail to head, with tail left, head right. So in (48, 37, right, 6), if head is 48 and tail is 37, that would imply tail at 37, head at 48, so the car is from 37 to 48? But 37 to 48 is 12 units, and speed 6, but let's not worry about size.\n\nActually, the span is given as (head, tail), so for right-moving, head is the right end, tail is the left end. So at t1, position from tail to head.\n\nBut in the update, for right-moving: span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all here are right-moving, I think.\n\nIn freeway 1, there are three cars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFreeway 2: one car (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nFreeways 3 to 8: each has two cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFreeway 3 to 8 all have identical cars? (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6) for each.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y at turn T, and for that freeway, at that turn, 0 is in the span of some car, meaning the car covers position 0 at time T.\n\nThe player is at (0, y_t) at turn t, and moves to y_{t+1} based on action.\n\nImportant note: if at turn T, you are on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, you are only on y_T, so you only check collision for freeway y_T at time T. You don't check y_{T+1} until turn T+1.\n\nSimilarly, when you arrive at a freeway, you check at that turn.\n\nNow, the goal is to reach (0,9) with minimal H, starting from (0,0) at turn t1=0.\n\ny=9 is the target, and there are cars on y=1 to 8, but y=0 and y=9 have no cars, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 is the start, no cars, and y=9 is the end, no cars, so no collision there.\n\nBut when at y=9, we need to be there to finish.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, I probably want to go up as fast as possible, but I need to avoid the cars when they are covering position 0.\n\nSince all cars are moving right at various speeds, I need to find times when position 0 is not covered on each freeway.\n\nBut the player moves vertically, so for each freeway, I need to cross it when no car is covering 0 at that turn.\n\nSince the player moves one row at a time, from y to y+1 or y-1 or stay, but since we start at 0 and go to 9, and time is critical, staying or down might not be useful, except to avoid collision.\n\nBut to minimize time, we probably want to go up as much as possible, only deviating if necessary to avoid waiting.\n\nBut since we can only change y by -1,0,+1 per turn, to go from 0 to 9, minimum turns is 9 if we go up every turn, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nSo H at least 9.\n\nBut with cars, it might take more.\n\nNow, let's define t as turns from start, so at t=0, position (0,0)\n\nWe need to find actions a_t for t=0 to H-1, such that y_H =9, with y_t starting from t=0.\n\nSet t1=0 as current turn.\n\nSo player position at turn t is y_t.\n\ny_0 =0\n\nWe need y_T =9 for some T, minimal T.\n\nThen H = T+1? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1 + H-1, so indices from t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, we have reached at turn t=H? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn t, before action, position is given, then we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position after action a_t is y_{t+1}.\n\nStart: turn t=0, position (0, y_0) = (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_0, we go to y_1, and so on.\n\nAfter action a_{k}, we are at y_{k+1}.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9), so when y_t =9 for some t.\n\nAt turn t, if y_t =9, we are done.\n\nBut the action sequence is up to when we reach.\n\nIn the answer, we list actions from turn t1 to when we reach.\n\nFor example, if we go up every turn, at turn 0, action U, go to y=1 at turn 1? Let's define.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nWe choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, position is (0, y_t)\n\nThen after a_t, at turn t+1, position is (0, y_{t+1})\n\nCollision is checked at each turn t: if at turn t, y_t = k for some k 1-8, and if on freeway k, position 0 is covered by a car at time t, then collision.\n\nTime t is in turns.\n\nNow, the target is to be at y_t =9 for some t, and no collision at any turn before that, including when at y_t=9, but since no cars, it's fine.\n\ny_t=9 has no cars, so when we are at y=9, no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 no cars.\n\nSo only when on y=1 to 8, we need to avoid collision at that turn.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly, we want to increase y as fast as possible, but we might need to stay or go down to avoid being on a row when a car is at 0.\n\nBut going down might not help much, since we have to go up eventually.\n\nStaying might be useful to wait for a car to pass.\n\nNow, since all cars are moving right, position 0 will be covered at certain times on each row.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find the times when position 0 is not covered by any car on that row.\n\nThen, for the player to be on that row at time t, 0 must not be covered at t for that row.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and when they cover 0.\n\nFirst, define the time from t1=0.\n\nSo for a freeway, at time t (turn from start), the span of a car.\n\nFor a car with head h, tail τ, direction right, speed s, at time t, the span is [τ + s*t, h + s*t] since t1=0, T-t1 = t.\n\nIn the update, T is the turn, t1 is start, so for turn T, time since start is T - t1 = T, since t1=0.\n\nSet t as turn number from 0.\n\nAt turn t, for a car, position span is:\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s*t, h + s*t]\n\n0 is covered if 0 is in [τ + s*t, h + s*t] for some car on that row.\n\nSince it's a closed interval, I assume.\n\nNow, for each freeway, find for which t, 0 is covered by any car.\n\nFirst, freeway 1 (y=1):\n\nCars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFirst car: head 48, tail 37, so at t, span [37 + 6t, 48 + 6t]\n\n0 in [37+6t, 48+6t] ?\n\n37+6t <= 0 <= 48+6t\n\nSince 37+6t <= 48+6t always, so 37+6t <= 0 and 0 <= 48+6t\n\nSo 37+6t <= 0 => 6t <= -37 => t <= -37/6 ≈ -6.166, but t >=0, so never true? t is non-negative integer.\n\n37+6t <= 0 for t <= -6.166, impossible, so 0 not in this interval for t>=0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 48+6t always true for t>=0, but the lower bound: 37+6t >0 for t>=0, so min of interval is 37+6t >=37>0, so 0 not in [37+6t,48+6t] for any t>=0.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6), head 12, tail 1, so span [1 + 6t, 12 + 6t]\n\n0 in [1+6t, 12+6t]?\n\n1+6t <= 0 <= 12+6t\n\n1+6t <=0 => 6t <= -1 => t <= -1/6, impossible.\n\n1+6t >=1 >0 for t>=0, so 0 not in interval.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,6), head -24, tail -35? Tail -35, head -24, so span [-35 + 6t, -24 + 6t]\n\n0 in [-35+6t, -24+6t]?\n\n-35+6t <= 0 <= -24+6t\n\nFirst inequality: -35+6t <=0 => 6t <=35 => t <= 35/6 ≈5.833, so t<=5\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -24+6t => 6t >=24 => t>=4\n\nSo for t=4,5, 0 is in [-35+6t, -24+6t]\n\nFor t=4: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0? 6t=24, so [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0]\n\n0 is included, since it says \"in the span\", and it's a closed interval, I think, so at t=4, [ -11, 0], 0 is covered.\n\nt=5: [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nt=3: [-35+18, -24+18] = [-17,-6], min -17<0, max -6<0, so 0 not in.\n\nt=6: [-35+36, -24+36]= [1,12], min>0, not.\n\nSo only for t=4 and t=5, this car covers 0.\n\nBut other cars don't cover 0, so on freeway 1, 0 is covered only at t=4 and t=5.\n\nSo for y=1, collision at t=4 and t=5, so player should not be on y=1 at turn 4 or 5.\n\nAt other times, safe to be on y=1.\n\nNow, freeway 2 (y=2):\n\nOne car: (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nHead -48? Head is -48, tail -83.\n\nDirection right, speed 36.\n\nSpan at t: [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-83 + 36t, -48 + 36t]\n\n0 in [-83+36t, -48+36t]\n\n-83+36t <= 0 <= -48+36t\n\nFirst: -83+36t <=0 => 36t <=83 => t <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so t<=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48+36t => 36t >=48 => t >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so t>=2 since t integer? t>= ceil(1.333)=2? Let's see.\n\n36t >=48 => t >= 48/36 = 4/3, so t >= 2 since t integer? t=1: 36*1=36<48, not >=48; t=2: 72>=48 yes.\n\nSimilarly, first inequality: t <= floor(83/36)= floor(2.305)=2\n\nt <= 83/36≈2.305, so t<=2\n\nt >= ceil(48/36)= ceil(4/3)= ceil(1.333)=2\n\nSo t=2.\n\nAt t=2, [-83+72, -48+72] = [-11, 24], 0 in it.\n\nt=1: [-83+36, -48+36]= [-47,-12], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nt=3: [-83+108, -48+108]= [25,60], min>0, not.\n\nSo only at t=2, 0 covered on freeway 2.\n\nThus, player should not be on y=2 at turn 2.\n\nNow, freeway 3 (y=3):\n\nCars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: head -48, tail -59, span at t: [-59 + 6t, -48 + 6t]\n\n0 in [-59+6t, -48+6t]\n\n-59+6t <=0 <= -48+6t\n\nFirst: -59+6t <=0 => 6t <=59 => t <= 59/6 ≈9.833, t<=9\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48+6t => 6t >=48 => t>=8\n\nSo t from 8 to 9 inclusive.\n\nt=8: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], 0 covered\n\nt=9: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6], 0 covered\n\nt=7: [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6], not\n\nt=10: [-59+60, -48+60]= [1,12], not\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6), head 0, tail -11, span [-11 + 6t, 0 + 6t] = [-11+6t, 6t]\n\n0 in [-11+6t, 6t]\n\n-11+6t <=0 <=6t\n\nFirst: -11+6t <=0 => 6t <=11 => t <= 11/6 ≈1.833, t<=1\n\nSecond: 0 <=6t always for t>=0, but 6t >=0.\n\nFirst inequality: t<=1, second: 0 <=6t always, but for 0 to be in, need lower bound <=0 and upper bound >=0.\n\nLower bound -11+6t <=0 when t<=1 (since t=1: -11+6=-5<=0, t=2: -11+12=1>0)\n\nUpper bound 6t >=0 always.\n\nSo for t where -11+6t <=0, which is t<=1, then since upper bound >=0, 0 is in interval.\n\nFor t=0: [-11,0], 0 covered\n\nt=1: [-5,6], 0 covered\n\nt=2: [1,12], min>0, not\n\nSo second car covers 0 at t=0 and t=1.\n\nNow for freeway 3, at each t, if either car covers 0.\n\nFirst car covers at t=8,9\n\nSecond car covers at t=0,1\n\nSo for t=0,1: covered by second car\n\nt=2 to7: not covered? Let's see.\n\nt=0: covered by second car\n\nt=1: covered by second car\n\nt=2: neither? First car: at t=2, [-59+12, -48+12]=[-47,-36], both <0, not cover\n\nSecond car: [ -11+12, 12] = [1,12], min>0, not cover\n\nSimilarly, t=3 to7: first car min negative, max negative until t=8,9\n\nt=3: [-59+18, -48+18]=[-41,-30]<0\n\n...\n\nt=7: [-59+42, -48+42]=[-17,-6]<0\n\nt=8: [-11,0] covered\n\nt=9: [-5,6] covered\n\nt=10: [1,12] not\n\nSo on freeway 3, 0 covered at t=0,1,8,9\n\nThus, unsafe at turns 0,1,8,9\n\nSafe at t=2,3,4,5,6,7,10,etc.\n\nNow, freeways 4 to 8 are identical to freeway 3? According to the table:\n\n| 4 | \\((-48, -59, right, 6), (0, -11, right, 6)\\) |\n\nSame as freeway 3.\n\nSimilarly for 5,6,7,8.\n\nAll have the same cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nSo for each of y=4 to 8, the coverage is the same: unsafe at t=0,1,8,9\n\nSafe at t=2,3,4,5,6,7,10,...\n\nBut t=10 and later might not be relevant if we go fast.\n\nNow freeway 1 we have: unsafe at t=4,5\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at t=2\n\nFreeway 3 to 8: unsafe at t=0,1,8,9\n\nNow, player starts at y=0 at t=0.\n\ny=0 has no cars, so at t=0, we are at (0,0), no collision.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe path: we need to be on each y from 1 to 8 at some point, but not necessarily sequentially, since we can go down or stay, but to save time, we should go up directly if possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on a row when it is unsafe.\n\nMoreover, we can stay on a row if safe, but since no need, we move up.\n\nThe minimal time would be to go up as fast as possible, only delaying when necessary.\n\nBut we might need to wait on some row.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe times for each row:\n\ny=1: unsafe t=4,5\n\ny=2: unsafe t=2\n\ny=3: unsafe t=0,1,8,9\n\ny=4: same, unsafe t=0,1,8,9\n\ny=5: same\n\ny=6: same\n\ny=7: same\n\ny=8: same, unsafe t=0,1,8,9\n\nNow, we start at t=0, y=0.\n\nAt t=0, we can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf we go U, to y=1 at t=1.\n\ny_{t+1} after action.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, choose a_t, go to y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t if on y_t and unsafe.\n\nAt t=0, y_0=0, no cars, safe.\n\nNow, if we do a_0 = U, then y_1 =1.\n\nAt t=1, we are on y=1.\n\nIs y=1 safe at t=1?\n\ny=1 unsafe only at t=4,5, so at t=1, safe.\n\nThen we can do a_1 = U, go to y=2 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=2.\n\ny=2 unsafe at t=2, so collision if we are there.\n\ny=2 unsafe at t=2, so at t=2, if on y=2, collision.\n\nBut if we go to y=2 at t=2, we are on it, so collision.\n\nWe need to avoid that.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=1, if we do not U to y=2 at t=2, but stay or down.\n\nIf stay, a_1=S, then y_2=1, still on y=1 at t=2.\n\ny=1 safe at t=2? y=1 unsafe only t=4,5, so t=2 safe.\n\nThen at t=2, on y=1, safe.\n\nBut we need to go to y=2 eventually.\n\ny=2 unsafe only at t=2, so at other times safe.\n\nFor example, at t=1, y=2 safe? y=2 unsafe only t=2, so t=1 safe, t=3 safe, etc.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, back to sequence.\n\nStart: t=0, y=0, safe.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nOne way: go to y=1 at t=1 by a_0=U.\n\nt=1, y=1, safe (since y=1 safe except t=4,5)\n\nNow, from here, if we go U to y=2 at t=2, but y=2 unsafe at t=2, so collision.\n\nSo cannot go directly to y=2 at t=2.\n\nWe need to arrive at y=2 at a time other than t=2.\n\nSince y=2 only unsafe at t=2, we can be on y=2 at t=1, t=3, etc.\n\nBut at t=1, we are on y=1, so to be on y=2 at t=1, we would have needed to be on y=2 at t=0 or something, but t=0 we were at y=0.\n\nThe only way to be on y=2 at t=1 is if we were at y=2 at t=0 and stayed, or from y=1 or y=3, but at t=0 we were at y=0.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=2 at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, at t=0, y=0.\n\nSo earliest to be on y=2 is t=2 or later.\n\nBut at t=2, unsafe.\n\nSo we must be on y=2 at t=3 or later.\n\nSimilarly, we can arrive at y=2 at t=1? No, from t=0, after a_0, y_1.\n\nIf a_0=U, y_1=1\n\nThen to be on y=2 at t=2, by a_1=U.\n\nBut unsafe.\n\nTo be on y=2 at t=3, we need to be on y=1 or y=2 or y=3 at t=2, and go to y=2 or stay.\n\nBut at t=2, if on y=2, unsafe, so we cannot be on y=2 at t=2.\n\nSo at t=2, we must be on y=1 or y=3 or other, but y=3 might be unsafe.\n\ny=3 unsafe at t=0,1,8,9, so at t=2, y=3 is safe, since t=2 not in unsafe times.\n\nSimilarly y=1 safe at t=2.\n\nSo, from t=1, y=1, we can do a_1=S, so at t=2, y_2=1, on y=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=2, we are on y=1, we can do a_2=U to go to y=2 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, y=2, now y=2 safe at t=3? Yes, only unsafe at t=2, so t=3 safe.\n\nThen we can go to y=3.\n\nBut y=3 unsafe at t=0,1,8,9, so at t=3, safe.\n\nWe need to go through each row.\n\nNow, y=3 to y=8 all have same unsafe times: t=0,1,8,9 unsafe, else safe.\n\nSo for y=3, we need to be on it when not t=0,1,8,9.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nWe are at t=0, y=0.\n\na_0: let's do U, to y=1 at t=1.\n\nt=1, y=1, safe.\n\nNow, instead of going to y=2 immediately, we stay: a_1=S, so at t=2, y_2=1, on y=1, safe (t=2 not unsafe for y=1).\n\nThen a_2=U, to y=2 at t=3.\n\nt=3, y=2, safe (y=2 only unsafe at t=2).\n\nNow, from y=2, we can go U to y=3 at t=4.\n\nt=4, y=3, now y=3 unsafe at t=8,9, but t=4 not unsafe, so safe? y=3 unsafe t=0,1,8,9, t=4 not in, so safe.\n\nBut t=4 is unsafe for y=1? But we are on y=3, not y=1.\n\nCollision only if on that row at that time.\n\nSo at t=4, on y=3, and y=3 safe at t=4, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, we can go to y=4 at t=5, and so on.\n\nBut y=3 to y=8 all safe except at t=8,9.\n\nt=4,5,6,7 are safe for all y=3 to 8.\n\ny=3 unsafe t=8,9, but t=4,5,6,7 safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, we are at t=3, y=2.\n\na_3=U, to y=3 at t=4.\n\nt=4, y=3, safe.\n\na_4=U, to y=4 at t=5.\n\nt=5, y=4, safe (y=4 unsafe t=0,1,8,9, t=5 safe).\n\na_5=U, to y=5 at t=6.\n\nt=6, y=5, safe.\n\na_6=U, to y=6 at t=7.\n\nt=7, y=6, safe.\n\na_7=U, to y=7 at t=8.\n\nt=8, y=7.\n\nNow y=7 is one of y=3 to8, unsafe at t=8,9.\n\nt=8 is unsafe for y=7, so if we are on y=7 at t=8, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt t=7, we are on y=6, safe.\n\nIf we do a_7=U, to y=7 at t=8, but unsafe.\n\nWe can do S or D.\n\nIf S, a_7=S, then at t=8, y_8=6, on y=6.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=8? y=6 same as y=3, unsafe at t=8,9, so at t=8, if on y=6, collision.\n\nSimilarly, all y=3 to8 unsafe at t=8,9.\n\nSo at t=8, if on any of y=3,4,5,6,7,8, it is unsafe, collision.\n\ny=1 and y=2 are different.\n\ny=1 unsafe t=4,5\n\ny=2 unsafe t=2\n\nAt t=8, y=1 is safe? y=1 unsafe only t=4,5, so t=8 safe.\n\ny=2 unsafe only t=2, so t=8 safe.\n\nBut y=3 to8 unsafe at t=8.\n\nSo at t=8, only safe to be on y=0,1,2,9, but y=0 and9 no cars, always safe.\n\ny=9 no cars, safe.\n\nBut we are at y=6 at t=7.\n\nTo avoid being on y=3-8 at t=8, we need to be on y=2 or below or y=9 at t=8.\n\nBut y=9 not yet.\n\nFrom y=6 at t=7, if we go down, a_7=D, to y=5 at t=8.\n\nBut y=5 is in 3-8, unsafe at t=8, collision.\n\nIf stay, a_7=S, y_8=6, still on y=6, unsafe.\n\nIf go up, to y=7, unsafe.\n\nSo all actions lead to collision at t=8 if on y=6 at t=7? No.\n\nWe need to not be on y=3-8 at t=8.\n\nSo at t=7, we must be on a row such that after action, we are not on y=3-8 at t=8.\n\nAt t=7, position y_7.\n\nAfter a_7, y_8 = y_7 + Δy.\n\nIf y_7 <=2, then we can go to y=1,2, or3, but if go to y=3, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if y_7 >=7, go to y=6,7,8, all unsafe at t=8.\n\ny_7=6, as above.\n\nBut if at t=7, we are on y=2, for example.\n\nLet's see the current plan.\n\nWe were at t=3, y=2.\n\nWe went to y=3 at t=4, y=4 at t=5, y=5 at t=6, y=6 at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, y=6.\n\nNow stuck for t=8.\n\nWe need to be on a safe row at t=8.\n\nSafe rows at t=8: y=0,1,2,9\n\ny=9 not reached, y=0 possible but far.\n\ny=1 and y=2 safe at t=8.\n\nBut we are at y=6, which is far.\n\nTo reach y=2 from y=6, it takes multiple down actions, but each down takes time and we might hit other unsafe times.\n\nFor example, from y=6 at t=7, if we go down, a_7=D, to y=5 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, y=5, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down multiple times, but at each turn, we are on a row, and for y=3-8, at t=8, all unsafe, so if at t=8 we are on any y=3-8, collision.\n\nThe only way to not be on y=3-8 at t=8 is to be on y=0,1,2 or 9.\n\nSince y=9 not reachable yet, we need to be on y=0,1,2 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=7, we are on y=6, which is not 0,1,2.\n\nTo be on y=2 at t=8, we need to be on y=1,2,3 at t=7 and go down or stay.\n\nBut at t=7, if on y=3, it is safe? y=3 unsafe at t=8,9, but t=7 is safe for y=3.\n\nAt t=7, y=3 safe.\n\nThen if on y=3 at t=7, we can go down to y=2 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, y=2, which is safe, since y=2 only unsafe at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=2 at t=7, stay or down to y=1, but y=1 at t=8 safe.\n\nBut we are at y=6 at t=7, not y=3.\n\nSo we need to be lower at t=7.\n\nPerhaps we should not have gone up so fast.\n\nWe need to delay the ascent to avoid being on high rows at t=8.\n\nt=8 is unsafe for y=3-8, but safe for y=1,2.\n\nAlso, t=9 unsafe for y=3-8.\n\nThen after that, safe again.\n\nMinimal H might be more than 9.\n\nLet's list the safe times for each row.\n\ny=1: safe except t=4,5\n\ny=2: safe except t=2\n\ny=3: safe except t=0,1,8,9\n\ny=4: same, safe except t=0,1,8,9\n\n...\n\ny=8: same\n\nTo go from y=0 to y=9, we need to spend at least one turn on each of y=1 to 8, but we can stay or move, so the number of turns is at least 9, but we may need to spend extra turns on some rows or go down.\n\nEach \"visit\" to a row must be at a safe time for that row.\n\nSince we can move only one step per turn, the sequence of y_t must be a path from 0 to 9 with steps -1,0,+1.\n\nWe need to find a path with minimal T such that y_T=9, and for each t, if y_t = k for k=1-8, then t is safe for row k.\n\nAnd y_t=0 or 9 always safe.\n\nNow, from the unsafe times, we see that for y=3 to 8, the only safe times are t=2 to7 and t>=10, but t=10 might be late.\n\nt=2,3,4,5,6,7 are safe for all y=3 to8.\n\nt=0,1,8,9 unsafe for them.\n\nSimilarly, for y=1, safe for t=0,1,2,3,6,7,8,9,... except t=4,5\n\ny=1 safe: t=0,1,2,3,6,7,8,9,10,... only unsafe t=4,5\n\ny=2 safe: t=0,1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,... only unsafe t=2\n\nWe start at t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nTo save time, we should go up when possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid the unsafe times for the rows.\n\nNow, one issue is at t=8 and t=9, y=3-8 are unsafe, so we should not be on those rows at those times.\n\nAlso, at t=4 and5, y=1 unsafe, but y=1 is low, so we can be higher by then.\n\nSimilarly, t=2 y=2 unsafe.\n\nNow, let's find a sequence.\n\nSuppose we want to be on y=1 at some safe time, etc.\n\nSince y=3 to8 can all be traversed safely between t=2 to t=7.\n\nt=2 to t=7 is 6 turns.\n\nBut there are 6 rows from y=3 to8, so we can go from y=2 to y=8 in 6 turns, from t=2 to t=7 or something.\n\nBut y=2 at t=2 is unsafe, so we cannot be on y=2 at t=2.\n\nSo let's start from beginning.\n\nt=0: y=0, safe. Action a_0.\n\nWe can go U to y=1 at t=1.\n\nt=1: y=1, and y=1 safe at t=1 (since unsafe only 4,5), so ok.\n\nNow, we cannot go to y=2 at t=2 because unsafe.\n\nSo we must stay on y=1 or go down, but going down to y=0 is wasteful.\n\nSo better to stay: a_1=S, so t=2: y=1, on y=1, which is safe at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, we can go U to y=2 at t=3.\n\nt=3: y=2, safe (since only unsafe at t=2).\n\nNow, from here, we need to go to y=3 to y=8.\n\ny=3 to y=8 all safe at t=3 to t=7.\n\nt=3,4,5,6,7 are safe for y=3-8.\n\nNow, we are at y=2 at t=3.\n\nWe can start going up.\n\na_3=U, to y=3 at t=4.\n\nt=4: y=3, safe.\n\na_4=U, to y=4 at t=5.\n\nt=5: y=4, safe.\n\na_5=U, to y=5 at t=6.\n\nt=6: y=5, safe.\n\na_6=U, to y=6 at t=7.\n\nt=7: y=6, safe.\n\nNow, at t=7, we are on y=6.\n\nWe need to go to y=7, then y=8, then y=9.\n\nBut if we go U to y=7 at t=8, t=8 y=7, but unsafe for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=8 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nAt t=7, we are on y=6, if we stay, at t=8 y=6, unsafe.\n\nIf we go down, to y=5 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on y=3-8 at t=8.\n\nTherefore, at t=8, we must be on y=0,1,2, or9.\n\nSince y=9 not possible, y=0,1,2.\n\nBut we are at y=6 at t=7, too high.\n\nSo we need to be lower at t=7.\n\nFor example, if we are on y=2 at t=7, then at t=8 we can be on y=2 or go to y=1 or y=3, but y=3 unsafe at t=8.\n\nSo if on y=2 at t=7, we can stay: a_7=S, then at t=8, y=2, safe.\n\nOr go down to y=1 at t=8, safe.\n\nBut we are at y=6 at t=7.\n\nHow to be low at t=7?\n\nWe need to delay the ascent or go down earlier.\n\nBut we have to go through all rows.\n\nAnother idea: since t=8 and t=9 are unsafe for y=3-8, we can be on y=1 or y=2 during those times, then after t=9, go up.\n\nBut t=10 and later are safe for all.\n\nBut that might take more time.\n\nFor example, at t=7, we should be on y=2 or below.\n\nBut from our current path, at t=3 we were at y=2, then we went up to y=6 at t=7.\n\nBut between t=3 and t=7, we used 4 turns to go from y=2 to y=6, which is 4 steps, but we could have taken fewer or more, but minimal steps is 4 for 4 rows? y=2 to y=3,4,5,6, that's 4 rows, 4 turns to go up 4 levels.\n\nBut we have to go to y=8 eventually.\n\ny=3 to y=8 is 6 rows.\n\nFrom t=3 to t=7 is 5 turns: t=3,4,5,6,7.\n\nAt t=3 y=2, then after actions at t=3,4,5,6, we reach y at t=4,5,6,7.\n\nIf we go up each time, at t=4 y=3, t=5 y=4, t=6 y=5, t=7 y=6.\n\nSo y=6 at t=7.\n\nWe need to reach y=8.\n\nBut at t=8, we cannot be on y=7 or8 because unsafe.\n\nSo perhaps from y=6 at t=7, we go down to lower row.\n\nBut going down takes time and we need to go up later.\n\nFor example, from y=6 at t=7, if we go down, a_7=D, to y=5 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, y=5, unsafe, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\na_7=S, y=6 at t=8, unsafe.\n\na_7=U, to y=7 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nSo no good.\n\nThe only way is to not be on y=3-8 at t=8.\n\nSo at t=7, we must be on y=0,1,2 so that at t=8 we can be on safe row.\n\nFor example, if at t=7, y=2, then a_7=S, at t=8 y=2, safe.\n\nOr a_7=D, to y=1 at t=8, safe.\n\nOr a_7=U, to y=3 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nSo better to stay or down.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=7, y=1, we can go to y=0,1,2 at t=8, all safe except if y=2 at t=2, but t=8 not t=2.\n\ny=2 safe at t=8.\n\nSo to be at low y at t=7.\n\nIn our sequence, we are at y=2 at t=3.\n\nInstead of going up immediately, we can stay on y=2 for a while.\n\nBut y=2 is safe at t=3,4,5,etc except t=2.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nFrom t=3, y=2, we can stay for some turns.\n\nFor example, stay at y=2 until t=7 or something.\n\nBut then we can go up later.\n\nBut the high rows are unsafe at t=8,9, so we need to go through them before t=8 or after t=9.\n\nAfter t=9, safe.\n\nBut going after t=9 might take more time.\n\nLet's see if we can go through all before t=8.\n\nThe safe window for y=3-8 is t=2 to t=7.\n\nt=2 to t=7 inclusive is 6 turns.\n\nWe need to be on each of y=3,4,5,6,7,8 at some point, but not necessarily in sequence, but since we move one step, we have to visit sequentially, but we can visit multiple times or stay.\n\nTo minimize time, we should go directly up without staying, but we may need to stay to wait.\n\nFor 6 rows, from y=2 to y=8, it takes at least 6 turns if we go up each time.\n\ny=2 to y=3 is one step, y=3 to y=4, etc, up to y=8, that's 6 steps to go from y=2 to y=8.\n\nFrom position y=2 to y=8, difference 6, so at least 6 turns if we go up each turn.\n\nWith 6 turns, we can be on y=3 at turn t, y=4 at t+1, ..., y=8 at t+5.\n\nThe turns must be within safe period for each.\n\nFor y=3, must be safe at turn when on it, similarly for others.\n\nSince all have same safe times, it must be between t=2 and t=7.\n\nSo the earliest we can start from y=2 is t=3 (since at t=3 we are on y=2), then go to y=3 at t=4, y=4 at t=5, y=5 at t=6, y=6 at t=7, y=7 at t=8, y=8 at t=9? Let's see.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=3, after a_3=U, at t=4 y=3\n\na_4=U, at t=5 y=4\n\na_5=U, at t=6 y=5\n\na_6=U, at t=7 y=6\n\na_7=U, at t=8 y=7\n\nBut at t=8, y=7, unsafe for y=7.\n\nIf we go to y=8 at t=8, same.\n\nTo reach y=8, from y=2, we need 6 steps: to y=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nEach step takes one turn, so from turn when we leave y=2.\n\nAt t=3 on y=2, after first U, at t=4 on y=3, then at t=5 on y=4, t=6 y=5, t=7 y=6, t=8 y=7, t=9 y=8.\n\nThen at t=9, y=8, but y=8 unsafe at t=9, collision.\n\nIf we start earlier, but at t=3 is the earliest we can be on y=2.\n\nAt t=2, we were on y=1, not y=2.\n\nSo we cannot start before t=3.\n\nThus, with this, we end up on y=7 at t=8 or y=8 at t=9, both unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, we need to be on the lower rows during t=8,9.\n\nFor example, during t=8 and t=9, be on y=1 or y=2.\n\nThen after t=9, go up to y=9.\n\nBut y=3-8 are safe after t=9.\n\nSo we can go from y=2 to y=8 between t=10 to t=15, but that would take more turns.\n\nMinimal H might be less if we can do something.\n\nAnother idea: go through y=1 and y=2 at times that avoid their unsafe times, and for y=3-8, traverse them before t=8.\n\nBut as above, we can only reach up to y=6 at t=7 if we start from y=2 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3 y=2, t=4 y=3, t=5 y=4, t=6 y=5, t=7 y=6.\n\nThen at t=7, y=6, we need to go to y=7 and y=8.\n\nBut at t=8, if we go to y=7, unsafe.\n\nWe can stay on y=6 at t=7 and t=8, but at t=8, y=6 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo down from y=6 at t=7 to lower row.\n\nBut to go down, for example, a_7=D, to y=5 at t=8, but y=5 unsafe at t=8.\n\nSame.\n\nSo the only way is to not be on y=3-8 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nTherefore, at t=7, we must be on y=0,1,2 so that at t=8 we can be on safe row.\n\nSimilarly for t=9.\n\nSo let's plan to be on y=2 at t=7, for example.\n\nThen at t=8, we can be on y=2 or y=1.\n\nThen at t=9, similarly.\n\nThen after t=9, go up to y=3-8.\n\nBut that will take more time.\n\nLet's outline the sequence.\n\nFirst, from t=0 to t=2, we can be on y=0,1.\n\nt=0: y=0, safe. a_0=U, to y=1 at t=1.\n\nt=1: y=1, safe. a_1=S, to y=1 at t=2. (since we cannot go to y=2 at t=2)\n\nt=2: y=1, safe. a_2=U, to y=2 at t=3.\n\nt=3: y=2, safe.\n\nNow, at t=3, y=2.\n\nInstead of going up, we stay on y=2 for several turns.\n\nFor example, stay at y=2 from t=3 to t=7.\n\nBut at t=7, we are on y=2.\n\nThen at t=8, we can stay on y=2 or go down to y=1.\n\nSay a_3=S, t=4 y=2\n\na_4=S, t=5 y=2\n\na_5=S, t=6 y=2\n\na_6=S, t=7 y=2\n\nNow at t=7, y=2.\n\nThen for t=8, we can stay: a_7=S, t=8 y=2, safe.\n\nAt t=8, y=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, we can stay or move.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nAt t=9, y=2, safe.\n\nBut y=3-8 are unsafe at t=9, so we cannot go to y=3 at t=9.\n\nWe can go to y=3 at t=10, for example.\n\na_8=U, to y=3 at t=9? At t=8, y=2, a_8=U, then at t=9 y=3.\n\nBut at t=9, y=3, unsafe for y=3, collision.\n\nSo cannot go to y=3 at t=9.\n\nSince t=9 unsafe for y=3, we must go to y=3 at t=10 or later.\n\nSo at t=8, y=2, we can stay: a_8=S, t=9 y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=9, y=2, a_9=U, to y=3 at t=10.\n\nt=10: y=3, safe (since t=10 not unsafe for y=3).\n\nThen a_10=U, to y=4 at t=11\n\nt=11: y=4, safe\n\na_11=U, to y=5 at t=12\n\nt=12: y=5, safe\n\na_12=U, to y=6 at t=13\n\nt=13: y=6, safe\n\na_13=U, to y=7 at t=14\n\nt=14: y=7, safe\n\na_14=U, to y=8 at t=15\n\nt=15: y=8, safe\n\nThen a_15=U, to y=9 at t=16\n\nt=16: y=9, reached.\n\nBut this took 16 turns from start, with many stays.\n\nWe can reduce by going up faster in the beginning or end.\n\nFor example, from t=0 to t=1, we went to y=1.\n\nAt t=1, instead of staying, we could go down, but not useful.\n\nOr at t=2, we went to y=2 at t=3.\n\nThen from t=3 to t=7, we stayed on y=2, but we could have gone to higher rows earlier if possible, but the unsafe times prevent.\n\nAnother idea: since y=1 is safe at t=0,1,2,3,6,7,8,9, we can be on y=1 at t=6 or7, but we need to be there earlier to progress.\n\nSimilarly, we can go to y=2 at t=3, then instead of staying, go up to y=3 at t=4, etc, but then we are high at t=7.\n\nBut at t=7, if we are on y=2, we can be safe at t=8.\n\nSo how to be on y=2 at t=7.\n\nFrom the beginning, we are at y=0 t=0.\n\nGo to y=1 at t=1.\n\nStay at y=1 at t=2.\n\nGo to y=2 at t=3.\n\nNow, from t=3 to t=7, we need to be on y=2 at t=7.\n\nBut at t=3, we are on y=2.\n\nIf we stay from t=3 to t=7, we are on y=2 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, y=2, we can stay for t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, we can go U to y=3 at t=9, but t=9 y=3 unsafe.\n\nSo we must stay on y=2 at t=9 or go down.\n\nBut at t=9, we can be on y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=9, a_9=U to y=3 at t=10, as before.\n\nSo still need to go up after t=9.\n\nBut we can go up faster from y=2 to y=9.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=7, to y=9, it takes 7 turns: to y=3 at t=8, but t=8 we are on y=2, a_7=U to y=3 at t=8, but at t=8 y=3 unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo must start going up after t=9.\n\nAt t=8, y=2, stay or down.\n\nSay a_8=S, t=9 y=2.\n\nThen a_9=U, t=10 y=3.\n\nThen to y=4 at t=11, y=5 t=12, y=6 t=13, y=7 t=14, y=8 t=15, then to y=9 at t=16.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut we can reach y=9 at t=16 with y_16=9.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=0 to t=15, 16 actions, but H is the number of turns in the sequence.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=0 to t=15 for 16 actions, but H is the length.\n\nDefine H as the number of actions to reach at turn H.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn H, position y_H.\n\nStart at t=0, after 0 actions, position y_0.\n\nAfter 1 action, y_1, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, y_H.\n\nWe need y_H =9 for some H.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nIn the above, at t=16, y=9, so H=16.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nFor example, at the beginning, we can be on y=1 later.\n\nAt t=0, y=0, we can stay or go up.\n\nIf we stay at y=0 for some turns, but that might waste time.\n\nFor example, at t=0, a_0=S, then t=1 y=0, safe but not progress.\n\nThen a_1=U, to y=1 at t=2.\n\nt=2: y=1, safe.\n\nThen a_2=U, to y=2 at t=3.\n\nt=3: y=2, safe.\n\nSame as before.\n\nOr at t=2, y=1, we can go to y=2 at t=3.\n\nNo gain.\n\nAnother idea: use the fact that at t=4 and5, y=1 is unsafe, but we can be higher by then.\n\nFor example, if we go up faster initially.\n\nAt t=0, a_0=U, to y=1 at t=1.\n\nt=1, y=1, safe.\n\na_1=U, but cannot to y=2 at t=2, unsafe.\n\nSo must do a_1=S, to y=1 at t=2.\n\nThen a_2=U, to y=2 at t=3.\n\nSame as before.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=3 directly or something, but no, must move one step.\n\nOr go down to y=0 at t=1, but wasteful.\n\nSo seems we are stuck with the slow path.\n\nBut let's check if we can be on y=3-8 at t=6 and t=7 only, but we have to be on each, so it takes multiple turns.\n\nSince all y=3-8 have the same safe times, we can be on them only during t=2 to t=7 for the lower ones, but t=2 is safe for y=3-8? t=2 is safe for y=3-8, yes, since unsafe only t=0,1,8,9.\n\nt=2 is safe.\n\nAt t=2, we are on y=1, not on y=3.\n\nWe can be on y=3 at t=2, but how?\n\nFrom t=0, y=0, to be on y=3 at t=2, we need to go up 3 steps in 2 turns, impossible, since only +1 per turn.\n\nMax we can be at t=2 is y=2.\n\nAt t=2, y<=2.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=3 at t=2.\n\nEarliest to be on y=3 is t=3, from y=2 at t=2, but at t=2, y=2 unsafe, so we cannot be on y=2 at t=2, thus cannot be on y=3 at t=3? Let's see.\n\nIf at t=2, we are on y=1 (safe), then a_2=U, to y=2 at t=3, then at t=3 on y=2, safe.\n\nThen a_3=U, to y=3 at t=4.\n\nSo on y=3 at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, on y=4 at t=5, etc.\n\nSo on y=6 at t=7.\n\nAs before.\n\nAt t=7, on y=6, we can go down to y=5, but at t=8 on y=5 unsafe.\n\nNot.\n\nOr at t=6, we are on y=5 (if we went up), then at t=6, y=5, safe, we can go down to y=4 at t=7, then at t=7, y=4, safe (t=7 safe for y=4), then at t=8, we need to not be on y=4, so go down to y=3 at t=8, but at t=8 y=3 unsafe.\n\nGo to y=2 from y=4.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=7, a_7=D, to y=3 at t=8, unsafe.\n\na_7=D twice? But one action per turn.\n\nAt t=7, from y=4, we can only go to y=3,4,5 at t=8.\n\nAll unsafe at t=8.\n\nSo impossible to avoid from y=4 at t=7.\n\nSimilarly for any y=3-8 at t=7, going to t=8, we go to y-1, y, or y+1, all in 3-8, unsafe at t=8.\n\nSo if at t=7 we are on y=3-8, we cannot avoid collision at t=8 if we move to those rows.\n\nUnless we can go to y=2 or below, but from y=3 at t=7, a_7=D, to y=2 at t=8, then at t=8 y=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, from y=4 at t=7, a_7=D, to y=3 at t=8, but y=3 at t=8 unsafe.\n\nOnly from y=3 at t=7, we can go down to y=2 at t=8.\n\nFrom y=4 or higher, we cannot reach y=2 in one step.\n\nSo the only escape is to be on y=3 at t=7, then go down to y=2 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, y=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, we can stay on y=2 or go down to y=1, safe.\n\nThen after t=9, go up.\n\nSo let's try that.\n\nFirst, get to y=3 at t=7.\n\nFrom start.\n\nt=0: y=0, a_0=U, to y=1 at t=1.\n\nt=1: y=1, a_1=S, to y=1 at t=2. (cannot go U because y=2 unsafe at t=2)\n\nt=2: y=1, a_2=U, to y=2 at t=3.\n\nt=3: y=2, now we need to be on y=3 at t=7.\n\nBut at t=3, y=2, we can go to y=3 at t=4, but we need to be on y=3 at t=7, so we must stay on y=3 for some time or go up and down.\n\nFor example, at t=3, y=2, a_3=U, to y=3 at t=4.\n\nt=4: y=3, safe.\n\nNow, we need to be on y=3 at t=7, so from t=4 to t=7, we can stay on y=3.\n\na_4=S, to y=3 at t=5\n\na_5=S, to y=3 at t=6\n\na_6=S, to y=3 at t=7\n\nt=7: y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, a_7=D, to y=2 at t=8.\n\nt=8: y=2, safe.\n\nNow, at t=8, y=2, we can stay or move.\n\nBut we need to go up to y=9.\n\ny=3-8 are safe after t=9.\n\nAt t=8, y=2, a_8=S, to y=2 at t=9. (since if go U to y=3 at t=9, unsafe)\n\nt=9: y=2, safe.\n\nThen a_9=U, to y=3 at t=10.\n\nt=10: y=3, safe.\n\nThen go up each turn to y=9.\n\na_10=U, t=11 y=4\n\na_11=U, t=12 y=5\n\na_12=U, t=13 y=6\n\na_13=U, t=14 y=7\n\na_14=U, t=15 y=8\n\na_15=U, t=16 y=9\n\nReached at t=16, same as before.\n\nBut we saved one turn? In this sequence, from t=3 to t=7, we stayed on y=3, but we could have gone higher and come down, but it might not save time.\n\nFor example, from y=3 at t=4, we could go up to y=4 at t=5, y=5 at t=6, then at t=6 y=5, we can go down to y=4 at t=7, but we need to be on y=3 at t=7 for going down to y=2.\n\nIf at t=6 y=5, a_6=D, to y=4 at t=7, then at t=7 y=4, then a_7=D, to y=3 at t=8, but at t=8 y=3 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf we go to y=3 at t=7 directly.\n\nIn the above, we stayed on y=3 from t=4 to t=7.\n\nBut we could have been on y=4 or5 at t=6, but then we cannot be on y=3 at t=7 easily.\n\nFor example, at t=6, if on y=5, to be on y=3 at t=7, we need to go down twice, impossible in one turn.\n\nSo only way is to be on y=3 at t=7 by staying or coming from nearby, but since we are at lower row, staying is fine.\n\nBut in terms of time, it's the same.\n\nAnother idea: go to higher rows earlier and then come down to y=3 at t=7.\n\nFor example, from y=2 at t=3, go up to y=6 by t=7, but then at t=7 y=6, we can go down to y=5 at t=8, unsafe, or to y=7, unsafe.\n\nCannot reach y=2 at t=8 from there.\n\nSo the only safe way is to be low during t=8 and t=9.\n\nMinimal H is 16 with the sequence above.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach faster.\n\nSuppose we go to y=1 at t=1, stay at t=2, to y=2 at t=3.\n\nThen from t=3 to t=6, go up to y=6.\n\nt=3 y=2, a_3=U, t=4 y=3\n\na_4=U, t=5 y=4\n\na_5=U, t=6 y=5\n\nThen at t=6, y=5, we can go down to y=4 at t=7, but at t=7 y=4, safe, but then at t=8, we need to go down to y=3 or something, but at t=8 y=3 unsafe.\n\nFrom y=5 at t=6, go down to y=4 at t=7, then from y=4 at t=7, go down to y=3 at t=8, but at t=8 y=3 unsafe.\n\nNot.\n\nGo down faster, but can't.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps start later.\n\nBut I think H=16 is the best we can do with this.\n\nBut let's list the sequence for H=16.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 0: U  (to y=1 at t=1)\n\nTurn 1: S  (stay at y=1 at t=2)\n\nTurn 2: U  (to y=2 at t=3)\n\nTurn 3: U  (to y=3 at t=4)\n\nTurn 4: S  (stay at y=3 at t=5) -- in my second sequence I had stay from t=4 to t=7\n\nIn the first slow path, or the one with staying at y=3.\n\nIn the sequence I had:\n\nt=0: a0=U, y1=1\n\nt=1: a1=S, y2=1\n\nt=2: a2=U, y3=2\n\nt=3: a3=U, y4=3\n\nt=4: a4=S, y5=3  (stay)\n\nt=5: a5=S, y6=3  (stay)\n\nt=6: a6=S, y7=3  (stay)\n\nt=7: a7=D, y8=2  (down to y=2)\n\nt=8: a8=S, y9=2  (stay)\n\nt=9: a9=U, y10=3\n\nt=10: a10=U, y11=4\n\nt=11: a11=U, y12=5\n\nt=12: a12=U, y13=6\n\nt=13: a13=U, y14=7\n\nt=14: a14=U, y15=8\n\nt=15: a15=U, y16=9\n\nSo at turn 16, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=0 to t=15, 16 actions.\n\nH=16.\n\nBut we can reduce the staying.\n\nFor example, from t=4 to t=6, we stayed at y=3 for three turns, but we could have gone higher and come down, but it may not save turns.\n\nSuppose at t=4, y=3, instead of staying, go up to y=4 at t=5.\n\nt=5: y=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=5, go up to y=5 at t=6.\n\nt=6: y=5, safe.\n\nThen at t=6, we need to be on y=3 at t=7? But we are at y=5, to be on y=3 at t=7, impossible, since we can only go to y=4,5,6 at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, if on y=5, we can go down to y=4 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nNot useful.\n\nGo down from t=6 y=5 to y=4 at t=7, then at t=7 y=4, go down to y=3 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nSo staying at y=3 is necessary to be low at t=7.\n\nWe can be on y=2 at t=7 directly.\n\nFor example, at t=3, y=2, stay until t=7.\n\nThen at t=7 y=2, go down to y=1 at t=8 or stay.\n\nBut in that case, we were on y=2 from t=3 to t=7, 5 turns, whereas in the above, we were on y=3 from t=4 to t=7, 4 turns, but then we went down, so similar.\n\nIn the sequence above, we used turns to stay, but we have to wait for the unsafe period to pass.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 in less than 16 turns.\n\nAnother thought: since y=3 to 8 can be traversed quickly during safe times, but the safe window is t=2 to t=7 for 6 turns, enough for 6 levels, but we start from y=2 at t=3, which is late.\n\nIf we can be on y=2 at t=2, but t=2 y=2 unsafe, impossible.\n\nEarliest to be on y=2 is t=3.\n\nThen on y=3 at t=4, ..., y=8 at t=9, but t=9 unsafe.\n\nSo we can only reach y=7 at t=8 or y=8 at t=9, both unsafe, so we must delay the traversal to after t=9.\n\nHence, minimal H is 16.\n\nBut let's check the cars on freeway 1 and 2, we have constraints, but in this sequence, we avoided them.\n\nFor example, at t=4 and t=5, we were on y=3, not on y=1, so no issue with y=1 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 only at t=3, safe.\n\nSo the sequence works.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize the actions.\n\nFor example, at t=4,5,6 we stayed at y=3, but we could have done something else, but I think it's fine.\n\nTo save one turn, suppose we go to y=4 at some point.\n\nBut then we have to come down, which takes more turns.\n\nFor example, from t=3 y=2, go U to y=3 at t=4.\n\nThen U to y=4 at t=5.\n\nThen at t=5 y=4, we can stay or go down.\n\nBut to be on y=3 at t=7, we need to go down at t=6 and t=7, but at t=6, from y=4, a6=D to y=3 at t=7.\n\nThen t=7 y=3, same as before.\n\nThen a7=D to y=2 at t=8.\n\nSame as sequence.\n\nNo saving.\n\nSo H=16 seems minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns from t1=0.\n\nIn the answer, list Turn t: a_t for each turn until we reach.\n\nIn the sequence above, we reach at t=16 after a15.\n\nThe actions are from turn 0 to turn 15.\n\nH=16 turns of actions.\n\nBut in the problem, H is the number of turns, and the sequence has H actions.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nSo for t1=0, actions from t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn this case, after 16 actions, at turn 16, y=9.\n\nActions: a0 to a15.\n\nNow, to write the sequence.\n\nBut perhaps we can start with S or something, but not better.\n\nAnother idea: at t=0, we can do S, stay at y=0, but then we delay, worse.\n\nOr at t=1, after U to y=1, we can go D to y=0 at t=2, but then at t=2 y=0, then go U to y=1 at t=3, etc, but we lose time.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, the sequence I have is probably minimal.\n\nBut let's list it clearly.\n\nTurn 0: U (from y0=0 to y1=1)\n\nTurn 1: S (y2=1)\n\nTurn 2: U (y3=2)\n\nTurn 3: U (y4=3)\n\nTurn 4: S (y5=3)  // stay\n\nTurn 5: S (y6=3)  // stay\n\nTurn 6: S (y7=3)  // stay\n\nTurn 7: D (y8=2)  // down to avoid\n\nTurn 8: S (y9=2)  // stay during unsafe\n\nTurn 9: U (y10=3)\n\nTurn 10: U (y11=4)\n\nTurn 11: U (y12=5)\n\nTurn 12: U (y13=6)\n\nTurn 13: U (y14=7)\n\nTurn 14: U (y15=8)\n\nTurn 15: U (y16=9)\n\nAfter turn 15 action, y16=9.\n\nH=16.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 7 is D, from y7=3 to y8=2.\n\nThen turn 8 S, y9=2.\n\nTurn 9 U to y10=3.\n\nBut at turn 9, we are at y9=2, after action U, to y10=3.\n\nTurn 9 action is at turn 9, position y9=2, choose a9=U, go to y10=3.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the list, we need to output for each turn the action.\n\nThe minimal H is 16.\n\nBut is there a way with H=15?\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at turn 15.\n\nThen y15=9.\n\nThat means we were at y14=8 or9, but if y14=9, already reached, so probably y14=8, then a14=U to y15=9.\n\nNow, y14=8 at turn 14.\n\nTurn 14 must be safe for y=8, so t=14 not in unsafe, safe.\n\nSimilarly, we need to be on y=8 at some safe time.\n\nThe path must include all y from 0 to 9, but not necessarily, we can skip if we move fast, but since move one step, we must visit each integer y between min and max, but we start at 0, end at 9, so we must visit each y from 0 to 9 at some point, but not necessarily in order if we go down, but in this case, we go up mostly.\n\nTo reach y=9 in 15 turns, we need net +9 in y, with actions +1,0,-1, so number of U minus number of D must be 9, and number of S, let say U - D =9, and U + D + S =15.\n\nSo U + D + S =15, U - D =9, so 2U + S =24, so U=12, S=0, D=3 for example, or other combinations.\n\nBut we have constraints from cars.\n\nSuppose we have some down actions to avoid.\n\nFor example, at some point go down to avoid high rows at t=8,9.\n\nBut with H=15, turn 15.\n\nt=8 and t=9 are within.\n\nAt t=8, we must not be on y=3-8, so on y=0,1,2.\n\nSimilarly at t=9.\n\nSuppose at t=7, we are on y=2, then at t=8 on y=2 or y=1.\n\nThen at t=9 on y=1 or y=2 or y=0.\n\nThen go up after.\n\nBut to reach y=9 by t=15, we need to go up fast.\n\nFor example, from t=9, y=2, go up to y=9 in 7 turns: y=3 at t=10, y=4 t=11, ..., y=9 at t=16, which is 7 turns from t=9 to t=16, but t=16 is after 16 actions.\n\nTo reach at t=15, from y=2 at t=9, to y=9 at t=15, we need +7 in 6 turns, impossible, since max +6 in 6 turns.\n\nFrom t=9 to t=15 is 6 turns, can increase y by at most 6, from y=2 to y=8, not to y=9.\n\ny at turn t.\n\nAt turn t=9, y9=2.\n\nAfter a9, y10.\n\nTo have y15=9, we need y15=9.\n\nFrom y9 to y15, 6 steps, so y15 <= y9 +6 = 2+6=8, so y15<=8, cannot be 9.\n\nIf y9=3, y15<=9, possible if all U.\n\nBut at t=9, if on y=3, unsafe, collision.\n\nSo cannot be on y=3 at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, if y9=1 or 2.\n\nThen y15 <= y9 +6 <= 2+6=8 or 1+6=7, less than 9.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 at t=15 if at t=9 we are on y<=2.\n\nIf we are on higher y at t=9, but y=3-8 unsafe at t=9, so we cannot be on them at t=9.\n\nThus, at t=9, we must be on y=0,1,2.\n\nThen y9 <=2.\n\nThen y15 <= y9 +6 <= 8 <9, so y15 <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 at turn 15.\n\nSimilarly, for any earlier turn, but t=16 is possible as above.\n\nThus minimal H is 16.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, to write the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, from turn 4 to 6, we have S,S,S, which is staying, but we can write the actions.\n\nAlso, for freeway 1, we had unsafe at t=4,5, but in this sequence, at t=4 and5, we are on y=3, not y=1, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo the minimal H is 16.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nAfter Turn 15 action, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, Turn 7 is D, but y=3 to y=2, which is down, but we are moving away from target, but necessary to avoid.\n\nNow, to box the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 2 has a car with speed 36, but we didn't interact, since we were on y=2 only at t=3 and t=8, both safe for y=2.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) is 16, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is determined to navigate safely by:\n- Moving up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 1.\n- Staying on \\(y = 1\\) at turn 2 to avoid being on \\(y = 2\\) at turn 2 (unsafe due to car coverage).\n- Moving up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 3 and then to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 4.\n- Staying on \\(y = 3\\) from turns 4 to 6 to avoid being on rows \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) during unsafe times at turns 8 and 9.\n- Moving down to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 8 to avoid being on rows \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 8 (unsafe).\n- Staying on \\(y = 2\\) at turn 9 to avoid being on rows \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 9 (unsafe).\n- Moving up sequentially from \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 9\\) from turns 10 to 15, as rows \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are safe after turn 9.\n\nThe action sequence ensures that the player is never on a freeway \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) when position 0 is covered by a car at that turn, based on the car movement rules.\n\n**Action Sequence**:\n- Turn 0: Move up (U) to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 1.\n- Turn 1: Stay (S) at \\(y = 1\\) for turn 2.\n- Turn 2: Move up (U) to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 3.\n- Turn 3: Move up (U) to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 4.\n- Turn 4: Stay (S) at \\(y = 3\\) for turn 5.\n- Turn 5: Stay (S) at \\(y = 3\\) for turn 6.\n- Turn 6: Stay (S) at \\(y = 3\\) for turn 7.\n- Turn 7: Move down (D) to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 8.\n- Turn 8: Stay (S) at \\(y = 2\\) for turn 9.\n- Turn 9: Move up (U) to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 10.\n- Turn 10: Move up (U) to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 11.\n- Turn 11: Move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 12.\n- Turn 12: Move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 13.\n- Turn 13: Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 14.\n- Turn 14: Move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 15.\n- Turn 15: Move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 16.\n\nAfter turn 15, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 16.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1\\text{: } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3\\text{: } U \\\\

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 1) at turn t_1 = 2. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway from y=1 to y=8. For each freeway, there are cars defined by their head, tail, direction, and speed. I need to avoid being on a freeway when there's a car that covers position x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe collision rule says: collision occurs at turn T only if for the player's y_T, there is a car on that freeway where 0 is in the span at turn T. Also, when you move, you're only considered on the new freeway at the next turn, so you don't get hit by cars on the freeway you're moving to in the same turn.\n\nNow, looking at the car states:\n\nFor freeway 1 (y=1): three cars: (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6). All moving right with speed 6.\n\nSince they're moving right, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] because for right-moving, it says [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] where ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all these are right-moving, so no left-moving cars here.\n\nt_1 is given as 2, so current turn is t_1 = 2.\n\nI need to find actions from t=2 onwards.\n\nSet t_1 = 2, so ΔT = T - 2.\n\nFor a car, at time T, position:\n\nIf right-moving: head at h + s(T-2), tail at τ + s(T-2)\n\nThe span is [min(head,tail), max(head,tail)] but since it's moving right, and for right-moving, head is greater, so span is [τ, h] at t_1, then at T, [τ + s(T-2), h + s(T-2)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right here.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1, cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For the first car: (60,49,right,6). Head is 60, tail is 49, but since direction is right, head should be greater than tail? 60>49, so head is right end, tail is left end? Let's see the span definition.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIt says for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is the tail, h is the head, and since right-moving, τ < h.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] with h < τ, I assume.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1, first car: (60,49,right,6), so τ=49, h=60? But it says (head, tail), so head=60, tail=49? But tail should be less than head for right-moving? 49<60, yes.\n\nIn the tuple, it's (head, tail, direction, speed), so for right, head > tail, for left, head < tail I think.\n\nBut in the car state, all are right-moving, so head > tail.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (24,13,right,6), head=24, tail=13, 24>13.\n\nThird car: (-12,-23,right,6), head=-12, tail=-23, -12 > -23, yes.\n\nNow, for collision: at turn T, if player is on freeway k, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at time T.\n\nSpan at T is [τ + s(T-2), h + s(T-2)] for right-moving cars.\n\nSimilarly for left, but no left here.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=1 at t=2.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, and there are no cars on y=9, since cars are only on y=1 to 8. y=9 is safe, I think, as long as we reach it.\n\nThe grid is y=0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 have no cars, I assume.\n\ny=0 might be the bottom, but player starts from y=1.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, since we need to go from y=1 to y=9, that's 8 units up. If we go up every turn, it would take 8 turns, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so it could take more.\n\nBut with cars, we need to avoid being on a freeway when a car covers x=0.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when it is safe to be on that freeway, i.e., when no car has 0 in its span at that time.\n\nSince we can only change y by one per turn, we need to plan a path through the y-levels over time.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when some car covers x=0.\n\nFor each freeway and each car, find the times T when 0 is in the car's span at T.\n\nThen, the freeway is unsafe at T if any car on it has 0 in span at T.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nThen, the player must be on a safe y at each turn.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe, I believe, since no cars.\n\ny=0 might be safe, but player starts at y=1.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway.\n\nStart with freeway 1 (y=1).\n\nCars:\n\n1. (head=60, tail=49, right, s=6)\n\nAt time T, span: [49 + 6(T-2), 60 + 6(T-2)]\n\nSet [τ + s(T-2), h + s(T-2)] = [49 + 6(T-2), 60 + 6(T-2)]\n\n0 in span if 49 + 6(T-2) <= 0 <= 60 + 6(T-2)\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nSolve for T.\n\nFirst inequality: 49 + 6(T-2) <= 0\n\n49 + 6T - 12 <= 0\n\n37 + 6T <= 0\n\n6T <= -37\n\nT <= -37/6 ≈ -6.166, which is less than t_1=2, so not relevant for future T.\n\nT-2 >=0 since T >= t_1=2, I assume we start from T=2.\n\nT is turn number, starting from 2.\n\nSo for T >=2, 49 + 6(T-2) >= 49 +0 =49 >0, since T-2>=0.\n\nSo lower bound 49 +6(T-2) >=49 >0, so 0 < lower bound, thus 0 not in [lower, upper] because lower >0, so 0 not in span for this car at any T>=2.\n\nLower bound is at least 49 >0, upper is larger, so span is always positive, 0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly, second car on y=1: (24,13,right,6)\n\nSpan at T: [13 + 6(T-2), 24 + 6(T-2)]\n\n0 in span if 13 + 6(T-2) <= 0 <= 24 + 6(T-2)\n\nFirst, 13 + 6(T-2) <= 0\n\n13 + 6T -12 <=0\n\n1 + 6T <=0\n\n6T <= -1\n\nT <= -1/6 <2, impossible for T>=2.\n\nSecond part, 0 <= 24 + 6(T-2) always true since min at T=2, 24>0.\n\nBut since lower bound >0 for T>=2, 13 +6(T-2) >=13>0, so 0 not <= lower bound, so 0 not in span.\n\nThird car: (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nhead=-12, tail=-23, so span at T: [ -23 + 6(T-2), -12 + 6(T-2) ]\n\n0 in span if -23 + 6(T-2) <= 0 <= -12 + 6(T-2)\n\nSolve:\n\nLeft: -23 + 6(T-2) <= 0\n\n6(T-2) <= 23\n\nT-2 <= 23/6 ≈ 3.833\n\nT <= 2 + 3.833 = 5.833, so T <=5 since T integer? Turns are discrete, I assume integers.\n\nT is turn number, integer.\n\nSimilarly, right: 0 <= -12 + 6(T-2)\n\n12 <= 6(T-2)\n\n2 <= T-2\n\nT >=4\n\nSo from T>=4 and T<=5, since T integer.\n\nT>=4 and T<=5.833, so T=4,5.\n\nFor T=4: lower bound: -23 +6(4-2) = -23 +12 = -11 <=0\n\nUpper bound: -12 +12=0 <=0? 0 <=0 is true, so 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly T=5: lower: -23 +6(3) = -23+18= -5 <=0\n\nUpper: -12+18=6 >=0, so 0 in span.\n\nT=6: lower: -23+6(4)= -23+24=1 >0, not <=0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly T=3: lower: -23 +6(1)= -23+6= -17 <=0, but upper: -12+6= -6 <0, so 0 <= -6 false, so 0 not in span.\n\nSo for this car, unsafe at T=4 and T=5.\n\nNow, are there other cars on y=1? Only these three.\n\nFirst two are always safe, third is unsafe at T=4,5.\n\nSo freeway y=1 is unsafe at T=4 and T=5, and safe otherwise for T>=2.\n\nAt T=2: let's check. T=2, ΔT=0, span for third car: [-23, -12], 0 not in, since -23 to -12, all negative.\n\nSimilarly, other cars not covering.\n\nSo y=1 safe at T=2,3,6,7,... except T=4,5 unsafe.\n\nNow, freeway 2 (y=2): only one car: (24, -11, right, 36)\n\nhead=24, tail=-11, direction right, speed 36.\n\nSpan at T: [ -11 + 36(T-2), 24 + 36(T-2) ]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 36(T-2) <= 0 <= 24 + 36(T-2)\n\nFirst, -11 + 36(T-2) <= 0\n\n36(T-2) <= 11\n\nT-2 <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nT <= 2 + 0.305 = 2.305, so T<=2 since integer.\n\nT=2: ΔT=0, span [-11,24], -11<=0<=24, yes 0 in span.\n\nT=3: -11 +36(1) =25 <=0? 25<=0 false, so not.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 24 +36(T-2) always true for T>=2.\n\nBut from first, only T=2 has lower <=0, T=3 lower=25>0.\n\nSo unsafe only at T=2.\n\nAt T=2, span [-11,24], 0 in it.\n\nFor T>2, lower bound -11 +36(ΔT) >= -11+36=25>0 for ΔT>=1, so always positive, 0 not covered.\n\nSo y=2 unsafe only at T=2, safe for T>2.\n\nNow, freeway 3 (y=3): cars (-36,-47,right,6) and (12,1,right,6)\n\nFirst car: head=-36, tail=-47, right, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [ -47 +6(T-2), -36 +6(T-2) ]\n\n0 in span if -47 +6(T-2) <= 0 <= -36 +6(T-2)\n\nLeft: -47 +6(ΔT) <=0\n\n6ΔT <=47\n\nΔT <=47/6≈7.833\n\nT <= 2 + 7.833 =9.833, T<=9\n\nRight: 0 <= -36 +6(ΔT)\n\n36 <=6(ΔT)\n\n6 <= ΔT\n\nT >= 2+6=8\n\nSo T>=8 and T<=9, so T=8,9\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,6) head=12, tail=1\n\nSpan: [1 +6(ΔT), 12 +6(ΔT)] all positive for ΔT>=0, so never covers 0, since min 1>0.\n\nSo only first car matters, unsafe at T=8,9.\n\nFreeway 4 to 8 have the same cars: (-36,-47,right,6) and (12,1,right,6), same as y=3.\n\nIn the table:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\n3 | (-36,-47,right,6), (12,1,right,6)\n\n4 | same\n\n5 | same\n\n6 | same\n\n7 | same\n\n8 | same\n\nAll freeways from y=3 to y=8 have identical car configurations: two cars each, both right-moving, speeds 6, with heads and tails as above.\n\nSo for each y=3 to 8, unsafe at T=8 and T=9, due to the first car, and safe otherwise.\n\nFor y=3, we have T=8,9 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for y=4 to 8, same thing.\n\nNow y=1: unsafe at T=4,5\n\ny=2: unsafe only at T=2\n\ny=3 to 8: unsafe at T=8,9\n\ny=0 and y=9: always safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,1) at t=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: if no cars, we could go up every turn, from y=1 to y=9 in 8 turns: t=2 to t=9, positions: t=2:y=1, t=3:y=2, ..., t=9:y=9? Let's see: start t=2, y=1.\n\nAfter one up: t=3, y=2\n\nt=4, y=3\n\n...\n\nt=9, y=8? t=2:y=1, t=3:y=2, t=4:y=3, t=5:y=4, t=6:y=5, t=7:y=6, t=8:y=7, t=9:y=8, then at t=10, y=9. Oh, to reach y=9, from y=1, need 8 moves up, so 8 actions, from t=2 to t=9, we reach y=8 at t=9, then at t=10, after action, y=9. But the turn when we reach y=9 is after H actions.\n\nDefine: we have actions from t = t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, so H actions, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9)? Let's see the problem.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nRead carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1 such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t_1 + 0, t_1 +1, ..., t_1 + (H-1)\n\nThen, the position after these actions, at time t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} would be the position after last action.\n\nBut we care about y at turn t, before action or after?\n\nThe collision is at turn T, meaning when the player is at position during that turn.\n\nFrom the dynamics: player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so at turn t, position is (0, y_t), and action a_t determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, position is (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nCollision at turn T if on y_T, and car covers x=0 at T.\n\nSo at each turn T, we have a position y_T, and it must be safe.\n\nFor reaching y=9 at turn t_1 + H - 1.\n\nSet t_1 = 2.\n\nSo we need y_{2 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nStart at t=2, y_2 =1.\n\nAfter actions a_2, a_3, ..., a_{2 + H -1}, we have y_{2 + H} = ? and we need y_{2 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{2 + H -1} =9 means at turn T=2+H-1, position is (0,9).\n\nThen, since y=9 is safe, no issue.\n\nThe actions are from t=2 to t=2+H-1, so H actions.\n\nFor example, if H=8, actions at t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9? t from 0 to H-1, so for H actions, times: t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so times 2+0=2, 2+1=3, ..., 2+(H-1)\n\nThen after these actions, at time t_1 + H = 2 + H, position y_{2+H} is set.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{2 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{2 + H -1} is the position at turn 2+H-1, which is after actions up to a_{2+H-2}, I think.\n\nLet k = turn number.\n\nAt turn k, position y_k.\n\nAction a_k is applied, then y_{k+1} = y_k + Δy_k.\n\nCollision at turn k if y_k is between 1 and 8 and there is a car on that freeway with 0 in span at k.\n\nWe start at k=2, y_2=1.\n\nWe need to have y_m =9 for some m, and minimize the number of turns to reach, so minimize m - 2? m is the turn when we are at y=9.\n\nFrom the problem: y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so at turn T = t_1 + H -1, y_T=9.\n\nAnd T - t_1 +1 = H, I think.\n\nSince y_{t_1} =1, and we go to y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, the number of actions is H, and we move from y=1 to y=9, which requires net +8 in y, so at least 8 actions if we only go up, but we might have S or D, so H >=8.\n\nWith cars, we might need to wait or detour.\n\nNow back to the safe times.\n\nSummary of unsafe times for each y:\n\ny=1: unsafe at k=4,5\n\ny=2: unsafe only at k=2\n\ny=3: unsafe at k=8,9\n\nSimilarly y=4 to y=8: same as y=3, unsafe at k=8,9\n\ny=0 and y=9: always safe.\n\nPlayer at k=2, y=1.\n\ny=1 is safe at k=2, since only unsafe at 4,5.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe direct path: go up each turn.\n\nk=2: y=1 (safe)\n\na_2 = U, then y_3 = y_2 +1 =2\n\nAt k=3, y=2, is it safe? y=2 unsafe only at k=2, so at k=3, safe.\n\na_3 = U, y_4 =3\n\nk=4, y=3? y_4=3, but y=3 unsafe at k=8,9, not at k=4, so should be safe? y=3 unsafe only at k=8,9, so at k=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_4 = U, y_5 =4\n\nk=5, y=4, safe, since y=4 unsafe only at k=8,9.\n\ny=4 to 8 unsafe only at k=8,9.\n\nk=5: y=4, safe.\n\na_5 = U, y_6=5\n\nk=6, y=5, safe\n\na_6 = U, y_7=6\n\nk=7, y=6, safe\n\na_7 = U, y_8=7\n\nk=8, y=7? y=7 unsafe at k=8,9? y=7 is freeway, unsafe at k=8,9.\n\nAt k=8, y=7, and y=7 unsafe at k=8, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nk=2: y=1, safe\n\na_2=U, y_3=2\n\nk=3: y=2, safe (since unsafe only k=2)\n\na_3=U, y_4=3\n\nk=4: y=3, safe (unsafe k=8,9)\n\na_4=U, y_5=4\n\nk=5: y=4, safe\n\na_5=U, y_6=5\n\nk=6: y=5, safe\n\na_6=U, y_7=6\n\nk=7: y=6, safe\n\na_7=U, y_8=7\n\nk=8: y=7, now y=7 unsafe at k=8, collision.\n\nThen we cannot reach y=9 at k=8 or something.\n\nIf we continue, a_8=U, y_9=8\n\nk=9: y=8, unsafe at k=9, collision.\n\nThen a_9=U, y_10=9, but at k=10, y=9, safe, but we are at y=9 at k=10, which is turn t_1 + H -1 if H=9? Let's see.\n\nTo reach y=9 earlier.\n\nIn the above, at k=8, we are at y=7 and collision, so we need to avoid that.\n\nPerhaps go faster or slower.\n\nSince y=3 to 8 are unsafe at k=8,9, we need to not be on those y at k=8 or k=9.\n\nIn the direct path, at k=8 we are at y=7 or y=8, which is unsafe.\n\nWe need to be on y=9 by k=8 or earlier, or after k=9, but later might take more turns.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nFirst, what is the earliest possible to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=1, we need at least 8 up moves to reach y=9, so minimum 8 actions, reaching at k=2+8-1=9? Let's set T = turn when y_T=9.\n\nWe need y_T=9 for some T.\n\nStart y_2=1.\n\nAfter each action, y changes.\n\nThe turn when we first reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at k=2, y=1, and we move, the earliest to reach y=9 is if we go up every turn: after 7 up moves, at k=9, y=9? k=2: y=1\n\na_2=U, y_3=2\n\na_3=U, y_4=3\n\n...\n\na_8=U, y_9=8? Let's list:\n\nAfter action a_k, y_{k+1} is set.\n\nAt k=2: before action, y_2=1\n\nAfter a_2, y_3 = y_2 + Δy_2\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPosition at turn k is y_k.\n\nAfter action a_k, position becomes y_{k+1}.\n\nTo have y_k =9 for some k.\n\ny_2=1.\n\nIf we do U at k=2,3,4,5,6,7,8: then\n\nAfter a_2: y_3 = 1 +1 =2\n\nAfter a_3: y_4 =2+1=3\n\nAfter a_4: y_5=4\n\nAfter a_5: y_6=5\n\nAfter a_6: y_7=6\n\nAfter a_7: y_8=7\n\nAfter a_8: y_9=8\n\nThen to have y_9=9, we need a_9=U, y_10=9.\n\nSo at k=10, y_10=9.\n\ny_k=9 at k=10.\n\nIf we do one more U, etc.\n\nBut with actions from k=2 to k=9, 8 actions, we reach y_10=9, so y_{t_1 + H} = y_{2+H} =9 if we have H actions.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 2 + H -1\n\nSet y_{2 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=8, y_{2+8-1}=y_9=9? In the above, with 8 U actions from k=2 to k=9, but actions at k=2 to k=9, that's 8 actions, t=2 to 9, then y_{10} =9, so y_{t_1 + H} = y_{2+8} = y_10=9, but we need y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{9} =9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith H actions at times t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H -1}, y_{t_1 + H} is set.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which is before the last action? y_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1, before action a_{t_1 + H -1} is applied.\n\nThen after a_{t_1 + H -1}, y_{t_1 + H} = y_{t_1 + H -1} + Δy.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so at that turn, position is 9, and we can choose action, but since it's already 9, we might do S or something.\n\nBut the position at that turn is 9, so no collision since y=9 safe.\n\nThen after action, it might change, but we don't care, as long as at that turn it is 9.\n\nFor example, to have y_T=9 for T= t_1 + H -1.\n\nFrom y_2=1, to have y_T=9, the number of turns from 2 to T is T-2, and net y change +8, so if we only go up, T-2 =8, so T=10, y_10=9.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{2 + H -1} =10, so 2+H-1=10, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions at t=2 to t=2+8=10? H actions from t=2 to t=2+H-1.\n\nIf H=9, actions at t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10? t from 0 to 8, times 2 to 10, that's 9 actions.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{2+9-1} = y_10.\n\nIf we set y_10=9, then H=9.\n\nWith 8 up actions, we can have y_9=8, then at k=9, y_9=8, which is not 9.\n\nTo have y_9=9, we need to be at y=8 at k=8, then U to y_9=9.\n\nOr at y=9 at k=8, but from y=1 to y=9 in 6 steps? Min 8 up moves.\n\nFrom k=2 y=1 to k=9 y=9, that's 7 steps? Positions: k=2:1, k=3:2, k=4:3, k=5:4, k=6:5, k=7:6, k=8:7, k=9:8, so to reach y=9 at k=9, we need to be at y=8 at k=8, then U to y_9=9.\n\nSimilarly, to reach at k=10, y_10=9 from y_9=8 with U.\n\nEarliest possible is at k=10 with y_10=9, after 8 up moves.\n\nBut with cars, we might be delayed.\n\nNow, in the direct path, with U every turn from k=2 to k=9 (8 actions), y_10=9, so for y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_10=9, so H-1=8, H=9, actions at t=2 to t=10? t_1 + H -1 =2+9-1=10.\n\nBut in the sequence, at k=8, we are at y=7, which is unsafe because y=7 unsafe at k=8.\n\nAs earlier calculation.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on y=3 to 8 at k=8 or k=9.\n\ny=3 to 8 are unsafe at k=8 and k=9.\n\nSo for k=8 and k=9, we cannot be on y=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nWe must be on y=0,1,2, or 9 at those turns.\n\nBut y=1 might be safe or not, y=1 unsafe at k=4,5, but k=8,9 is later, so y=1 safe at k=8,9.\n\ny=2 safe at k=8,9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nSo at k=8 and k=9, we need to be on y=0,1,2, or 9.\n\nBut we want to reach y=9 as early as possible.\n\nEarliest possible y=9 at k=10, as above.\n\nBut at k=8 and k=9, we need to not be on y=3-8.\n\nIn the direct path, at k=8, y=7, which is bad.\n\nSo we need to adjust.\n\nPerhaps go slower or faster.\n\nGo faster: to reach y=9 earlier, but we can't, since min 8 up moves, earliest at k=10.\n\nk=10 is after 8 actions from k=2.\n\nStart k=2 y=1.\n\nAfter 1 up: k=3 y=2\n\nAfter 2: k=4 y=3\n\nAfter 3: k=5 y=4\n\nAfter 4: k=6 y=5\n\nAfter 5: k=7 y=6\n\nAfter 6: k=8 y=7\n\nAfter 7: k=9 y=8\n\nAfter 8: k=10 y=9\n\nSo to have y_k=9 at k=10.\n\nAt k=8, y=7, unsafe.\n\nAt k=9, y=8, unsafe.\n\nBoth turns we have collision.\n\nSo we must avoid that.\n\nWe need to be at lower y at k=8 and k=9.\n\nFor example, at k=8, be at y=2 or below, or y=9.\n\nSimilarly k=9.\n\nBut y=9 at k=9 is possible only if we reach earlier, but we can't reach before k=10.\n\ny_9=9 only if from y_8=8 with U, but at k=9, y=9 safe, but at k=8, if y=8, unsafe.\n\nIf we are at y=9 at k=8, but from y=1 at k=2, to y=9 at k=8, that's 6 turns, net +8, impossible with max +1 per turn.\n\nSo earliest y=9 at k=10.\n\nSo at k=8 and k=9, we must be on y=0,1,2.\n\ny=1 and y=2 are safe at k=8,9.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nSo we need to be at y<=2 at k=8 and k=9.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 by k=10 or later.\n\nIf we are at y=2 at k=9, then we can go up to y=3 at k=10, but we need y=9, far away.\n\nLet's think of a path.\n\nStart at k=2, y=1, safe.\n\nWe can go up or down or stay.\n\nBut going down to y=0 might waste time.\n\nSince at k=8 and k=9 we need to be low, we can go slow first, then fast later.\n\nFor example, stay at y=1 for some turns, but y=1 unsafe at k=4,5, so at k=4,5 we cannot be on y=1.\n\nk=4 and 5 y=1 unsafe.\n\nSo at k=4 and 5, we need to not be on y=1.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 safe except k=2, but k=2 passed.\n\nSo possible actions.\n\nLet me list the safe y for each turn from k=2 onwards.\n\nk=2: y=1 is safe (since unsafe k=4,5, not k=2)\n\ny=2 unsafe at k=2, so at k=2, only y=1 is occupied, safe.\n\nk=3: y=1 unsafe? y=1 unsafe at k=4,5, not k=3, so safe. y=2 safe at k=3. y=0 safe.\n\nk=4: y=1 unsafe, y=2 safe, y=3 safe (unsafe k=8,9), y=0 safe.\n\nSimilarly k=5: y=1 unsafe, y=2 safe, y=3 safe, etc.\n\nk=6: all y safe except possibly, but y=1 safe now, y=2 safe, y=3 safe, since unsafe only at k=8,9.\n\nk=7: similar.\n\nk=8: y=1 safe, y=2 safe, y=3 unsafe, y=4 unsafe, ..., y=8 unsafe, y=0 safe, y=9 safe.\n\nk=9: same, y=1,2,0,9 safe, y=3-8 unsafe.\n\nk=10: all safe except if cars, but y=3-8 unsafe only at k=8,9, so at k=10 safe. y=9 safe.\n\netc.\n\nNow, we need to go from k=2 y=1 to some k where y_k=9.\n\nMinimal k for y_k=9 is k=10.\n\nBut at k=8 and k=9, we need to be on safe y, i.e., y=0,1,2,9.\n\nBut y=9 not possible at k=8 or 9, so must be on y=0,1,2 at k=8 and k=9.\n\nThen from there, go to y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is at higher, so from y=2 at k=9, we need to go up 7 times, so at least k=16 to reach y=9, which is late.\n\nFor example, at k=9 y=2, then U to k=10 y=3, but at k=10, y=3 safe, then U to k=11 y=4, etc., up to k=16 y=9, which is H large.\n\nBut we can be at higher y before k=8, as long as not on y=3-8 at k=8 and k=9.\n\nFor example, we can reach y=7 at k=7, then at k=8, instead of going up, we go down to y=6 or something, but y=6 unsafe at k=8.\n\nAt k=8, we need to be on y=0,1,2.\n\nSo if at k=7, we are at y=2, for example.\n\nThen at k=8, we can stay or go up or down.\n\nBut at k=8, y must be 0,1,2.\n\nSimilarly k=9.\n\nSo let's plan a path where at k=8 and k=9, y is low.\n\nStart k=2, y=1.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 eventually.\n\nSince we have to spend k=8 and k=9 at low y, we should progress before that.\n\nFor example, from k=2 to k=7, we can go up to some y, but not too high because at k=7, if we are at y=7, then at k=8 we need to go down to y=6, but y=6 unsafe at k=8, or to y=8, worse.\n\nFrom y=7 at k=7, if we go down to y=6 at k=8, but y=6 unsafe at k=8, collision.\n\nIf we go down to y=6, at k=8, y=6, unsafe.\n\nIf we go up to y=8, unsafe.\n\nOr stay y=7, unsafe.\n\nSo from k=7, if y=7, all actions lead to unsafe at k=8, since y=7 to y=6,7,8 all unsafe at k=8.\n\nSimilarly, if at k=7 y=6, then at k=8, if U to y=7 unsafe, D to y=5 unsafe, S to y=6 unsafe.\n\nAll y=3 to 8 unsafe at k=8.\n\nSo at k=7, we cannot be on y=3 to 8, because from there, any action to y=3 to 8 at k=8, all unsafe.\n\nIf at k=7 y=2, then we can go to y=1,2,3 at k=8.\n\nBut at k=8, y=3 unsafe, so only y=1 or 2 safe.\n\nSimilarly, if at k=7 y=1, we can go to y=0,1,2 at k=8, but y=1 and 2 safe at k=8.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nSimilarly, if at k=7 y=0, we can go to y=0,1.\n\nNow, at k=9 similar.\n\nBut we need to reach high y later.\n\nTo minimize time, we should be as high as possible before k=8.\n\nAt k=7, we can be on y=2, for example, since y=3 to 8 are possible but then stuck at k=8.\n\nAt k=7, y=2 is safe, then at k=8, we can stay at y=2 or go to y=1 or y=3, but y=3 unsafe at k=8, so only y=1 or 2.\n\nSay stay at y=2 or go to y=1.\n\nSimilarly at k=9, same.\n\nThen after k=9, we can go up.\n\nBut from y=2 at k=9, we need 7 up to y=9, reach at k=16.\n\nBut we can be higher at k=7.\n\nWhat is the highest we can be at k=7 without problem.\n\nAt k=7, we can be on y=2, as above, or y=1, or y=0.\n\ny=3 at k=7 is safe, but then at k=8, we cannot go anywhere safe except if we go down to y=2, but at k=8, when we go down to y=2, at turn k=8, position is y=2, which is safe.\n\nLet's see.\n\nAt turn k, position y_k.\n\nAction a_k determines y_{k+1}.\n\nFor collision at k, depends on y_k.\n\nAt k=7, if y_7=3, which is safe since unsafe only k=8,9.\n\nThen a_7 can be U, D, S.\n\nIf a_7=U, y_8=4\n\nAt k=8, y_8=4, unsafe.\n\nIf a_7=D, y_8=2\n\nAt k=8, y_8=2, safe.\n\nIf a_7=S, y_8=3, unsafe at k=8.\n\nSo only possible to go down to y=2 at k=8.\n\nSimilarly, if y_7=4, we can go down to y=3 or y=5, but at k=8, y=3 or 5 unsafe, so only go down to y=2? From y=4, D to y=3, but y=3 unsafe at k=8.\n\nU to y=5 unsafe, S to y=4 unsafe.\n\nSo from y=4 at k=7, no action to safe y at k=8, because y=2,3,4,5 all unsafe except y=2 but from y=4, we can only reach y=3,4,5 at k=8, all unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for y=5,6,7,8 at k=7, same issue.\n\nOnly from y=2 at k=7, we can go to y=1,2,3 at k=8, and y=1 or 2 safe.\n\nSimilarly, from y=1 at k=7, we can go to y=0,1,2 at k=8, all safe since y=0,1,2 safe at k=8.\n\nFrom y=0 at k=7, go to y=0 or 1 at k=8.\n\nSo at k=7, to be safe for transition to k=8, we must be on y=0,1,2 at k=7.\n\nSimilarly, for k=9, but we can handle later.\n\nFirst, focus on k=8.\n\nSo at k=7, we must be on y=0,1, or 2.\n\nSimilarly, at k=8, we must be on y=0,1,2.\n\nAnd at k=9, similarly, must be on y=0,1,2 or 9.\n\nBut y=9 not reachable yet.\n\nNow, we start from k=2 y=1.\n\nWe need to reach y=0,1,2 at k=7.\n\nFrom k=2 to k=7, that's 5 turns: k=3,4,5,6,7 positions to set.\n\nNet y change from y_2=1 to y_7, which should be 0,1,2.\n\nSo we can go down or stay.\n\nBut we have constraint at k=4 and 5 for y=1 unsafe.\n\nAlso, y=2 unsafe at k=2, but passed.\n\nNow, let's list possible y for each k.\n\nk=2: y=1 (only, since start)\n\nk=3: can be y=0,1,2 (from a_2: U to 2, D to 0, S to 1)\n\nBut y=0 and y=1 safe at k=3, y=2 safe.\n\nk=4: y=1 unsafe, so cannot be on y=1. Can be y=0,2,3 (from previous actions)\n\nSimilarly, k=5: y=1 unsafe, so can be y=0,2,3,4 etc.\n\nk=6: all y safe\n\nk=7: must be y=0,1,2 for safety at k=8.\n\nSimilarly, k=8: must be y=0,1,2\n\nk=9: must be y=0,1,2 or 9, but 9 not possible, so y=0,1,2\n\nThen after that, go up to y=9.\n\nNow, to minimize time, we should be as high as possible at k=7, so y=2.\n\nSimilarly at k=8 and k=9, y=2.\n\nThen from k=9 y=2, go up 7 times to reach y=9 at k=16.\n\nBut H would be large.\n\nWe can reach higher earlier.\n\nFor example, at k=6, we can be on y=6, for instance, which is safe, then at k=7, we need to go down to y=2 or something.\n\nBut from y=6 at k=6, we can go to y=5,6,7 at k=7.\n\nBut at k=7, we need to be on y=0,1,2, so from y=6, we can go down to y=5, but y=5 at k=7 is not 0,1,2.\n\nTo reach y=2 at k=7 from y=6 at k=6, we need to go down 4 times in one turn? Impossible, only one action.\n\nΔy = -1 per action, so from y=6 at k=6, after one action, y_7 can be 5,6,7, all not 0,1,2.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=6 at k=6 if we want to be low at k=7.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=2 at k=7, at k=6 we must be at y=1,2,3.\n\nBecause from y=3 at k=6, D to y=2 at k=7.\n\nFrom y=2, S or U or D to y=1,2,3.\n\nFrom y=1, U to y=2, etc.\n\nBut at k=7, we need y_7=0,1,2.\n\nSo at k=6, we must be at y such that we can reach y=0,1,2 in one step, so y=0,1,2,3 at k=6? From y=3, D to y=2; y=2 to y=1,2,3; y=1 to y=0,1,2; y=0 to y=0,1.\n\nAll possible to reach y=0,1,2 at k=7.\n\nBut at k=6, y=3 is safe, since unsafe only k=8,9.\n\nSimilarly higher, but if at k=6 y=4, we can go to y=3,4,5 at k=7, none of which are 0,1,2, so cannot reach y=0,1,2 at k=7.\n\nSimilarly for y=5,6,7,8 at k=6, cannot reach y=0,1,2 at k=7 in one step.\n\nSo at k=6, we must be on y=0,1,2,3 to be able to reach y=0,1,2 at k=7.\n\nSimilarly, earlier turns.\n\nTo be high, we should be at y=3 at k=6, then down to y=2 at k=7.\n\nThen at k=7 y=2.\n\nThen at k=8, we can stay y=2 or go to y=1 or y=3, but y=3 unsafe at k=8, so only y=1 or 2.\n\nSimilarly at k=9.\n\nBut at k=9, if we are at y=2, we can go up later.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach y=9 faster by being high before k=8.\n\nFor example, at k=7, we are at y=2.\n\nThen from k=7 to k=10, we can go up, but at k=10 y=5, for example, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at k=10, we need to be at y=8 at k=9, but at k=9, y=8 unsafe, and we cannot be on y=8 at k=9.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 before k=10, and at k=10 it is possible only if we are not on y=3-8 at k=8 and k=9, which we are low.\n\nBut at k=10, we can be on y=3, safe, and go up.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=9 is k=10, but only if at k=9 we are at y=8, which is unsafe, so impossible.\n\ny_10=9 only if y_9=8 with U, but at k=9, y_9=8 unsafe.\n\nIf y_9=9, but that requires y_8=8 or 9, but y_8=8 unsafe, or if y_8=9, impossible from start.\n\nSo it is impossible to reach y=9 at k=10 because it requires being at y=8 at k=9, which is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, at k=11, y_11=9 requires y_10=8 or 9, but at k=10, y=8 is safe? k=10, y=8 unsafe only at k=8,9, so at k=10 safe.\n\ny_10=8 is safe at k=10.\n\nThen with U, y_11=9.\n\nSimilarly, y_11=9 at k=11.\n\nWith y_10=8.\n\nBut to have y_10=8, we need to be at y=7 or 8 or 9 at k=9, but at k=9, y=7 or 8 unsafe, y=9 not possible, so we cannot be at y=7 or 8 at k=9.\n\nTherefore, we cannot have y_10=8 because it requires y_9=7,8, or9, but at k=9, y=7 or 8 unsafe, y=9 impossible.\n\nSo y_10 cannot be 8.\n\nSimilarly, y_10 can be 7, but from y_9=6,7,8.\n\nAt k=9, y=6,7,8 unsafe, so not possible.\n\ny=9 at k=9 impossible.\n\nSo at k=9, we can only be on y=0,1,2.\n\nSo y_9 must be 0,1, or 2.\n\nThen y_10 can be 0,1,2,3.\n\nThen to reach y=9, it takes more turns.\n\nEarliest y_10=3, then y_11=4, ..., y_16=9, so at k=16.\n\nH for y_{2+H-1} =9, so 2+H-1=16, H-1=14, H=15.\n\nBut perhaps we can be higher at k=10.\n\nSince at k=8 and k=9, we are at low y, but after that, no restrictions, so we can go up fast.\n\nBut from y=2 at k=9, to y=9, need 7 up moves, so y_9=2, y_10=3, y_11=4, ..., y_16=9.\n\nSo k=16 for y=9.\n\nH such that 2+H-1=16, H-1=14, H=15 actions.\n\nBut let's see if we can reduce.\n\nPerhaps we can be at higher y at k=7, but k=7 we are at y=2, then at k=8 y=2, k=9 y=2, then up.\n\nBut at k=6, we can be at y=3, then down to y=2 at k=7.\n\ny=3 at k=6 is safe.\n\nHow to reach y=3 at k=6.\n\nFrom start.\n\nk=2 y=1.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=1 at k=4 and k=5.\n\nAlso, at k=3, we can be at y=0,1,2.\n\nLet's find a path to be at y=3 at k=6.\n\nStart k=2 y=1.\n\na_2: can U, D, or S.\n\nIf a_2=U, y_3=2\n\nk=3 y=2, safe.\n\nNow a_3: can U to y=3, D to y=1, S to y=2.\n\nk=4: y=1 unsafe, so we cannot be on y=1 at k=4.\n\nSo at k=4, y must not be 1.\n\nSo from k=3 y=2, if a_3=U, y_4=3\n\nIf a_3=D, y_4=1, unsafe, not allowed.\n\nIf a_3=S, y_4=2\n\nBoth U and S are possible for k=4.\n\nIf a_3=U, y_4=3\n\nThen at k=4, y=3, safe.\n\na_4: U to y=4, D to y=2, S to y=3.\n\nk=5: y=1 unsafe, so y=2,3,4 are safe.\n\na_4 any is ok, but we want to go high.\n\nSay a_4=U, y_5=4\n\nk=5 y=4, safe.\n\na_5: U to y=5, D to y=3, S to y=4.\n\nk=6: all safe.\n\nWe want y_6=3 for example.\n\nSo if a_5=D, y_6=3\n\nOr if a_5=S, y_6=4, etc.\n\nBut we need to be at y=0,1,2 at k=7.\n\nSo at k=6, we need to be able to reach y=0,1,2 at k=7.\n\nIf at k=6 y=3, we can a_6=D to y_7=2\n\nThen at k=7 y=2, good.\n\nIf at k=6 y=4, we can D to y_7=3, but y=3 not 0,1,2, or to y=4 or 5, not good.\n\nSo we need y_6 <=3.\n\nSimilarly, if y_6=2, we can S to y_7=2 or D to y_7=1 or U to y_7=3, which we can choose to stay or down to be at 1 or 2.\n\nBut we need y_7=0,1,2.\n\nSo y_6 can be 0,1,2,3.\n\nWith y_6=3, we can go to y_7=2.\n\nIn the above, from k=2:\n\na_2=U, y_3=2\n\na_3=U, y_4=3\n\na_4=U, y_5=4\n\na_5=D, y_6=3  (since we want y_6=3)\n\nThen a_6=D, y_7=2\n\nNow at k=7, y=2, good.\n\nThen at k=8, we need to be on y=0,1,2.\n\nSo a_7 can be S, to y_8=2 or D to y_8=1 or U to y_8=3 but unsafe, so not U.\n\nSay a_7=S, y_8=2\n\nThen at k=8, y=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at k=9, we need to be on y=0,1,2.\n\na_8 can be S to y_9=2 or D to y_9=1 or U to y_9=3 unsafe, so not U.\n\nSay a_8=S, y_9=2\n\nThen at k=9, y=2, safe.\n\nNow from here, we need to go to y=9.\n\na_9=U, y_10=3\n\nk=10, y=3, safe (since unsafe only k=8,9)\n\na_10=U, y_11=4\n\nsafe\n\na_11=U, y_12=5\n\nsafe\n\na_12=U, y_13=6\n\nsafe\n\na_13=U, y_14=7\n\nsafe\n\na_14=U, y_15=8\n\nsafe\n\na_15=U, y_16=9\n\nNow at k=16, y=9.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{2 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo 2 + H -1 =16, so H-1=14, H=15.\n\nActions from t=2 to t=2+14=16? H actions at t=2 to t=2+H-1.\n\nFor H=15, actions at t=2 to t=2+14=16.\n\ny_{2+H-1} = y_{2+14} = y_16=9, yes.\n\nBut in the sequence, at k=10 to k=15, we are going up from y=3 to y=8, all safe since k=10>9.\n\nk=10 to 15, all safe for y=3-8.\n\nBut H=15 seems long, but with the cars, it might be necessary.\n\nBut let's see if we can be higher earlier.\n\nFor example, at k=6, instead of y=3, can we be higher?\n\nEarlier at k=5, we had y_5=4.\n\nIf we go up at k=5, a_5=U, y_6=5\n\nBut at k=6 y=5, then to reach y=0,1,2 at k=7, we need to go down, but from y=5, a_6=D to y_7=4, not 0,1,2; or to y=5 or 6, not good. Cannot reach y<=2 in one step from y=5.\n\nSimilarly, if at k=4, we go down or something.\n\nStart over.\n\nk=2 y=1\n\na_2=S, y_3=1\n\nk=3 y=1, safe\n\na_3: cannot go to y=1 at k=4, so must not S or D, must U to y_4=2? a_3=U, y_4=2\n\nThen k=4 y=2, safe\n\na_4=U, y_5=3\n\nk=5 y=3, safe\n\na_5=U, y_6=4\n\nk=6 y=4\n\nThen to reach y=0,1,2 at k=7, from y=4, a_6=D to y_7=3, not <=2; U to 5, S to 4, all not 0,1,2. Impossible.\n\nIf a_4=D, from k=4 y=2, a_4=D to y_5=1, but at k=5, y=1 unsafe, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\na_4=S, y_5=2\n\nThen a_5=U, y_6=3\n\nThen a_6=D, y_7=2 as before.\n\nOr a_5=D, y_6=1, but at k=6 y=1, safe, then a_6=D to y_7=0 or U to y_7=2 or S to 1, all can be 0,1,2.\n\nSay a_5=D, y_6=1\n\nThen a_6=D, y_7=0\n\nOr a_6=U, y_7=2\n\nOr S, y_7=1.\n\nAll possible for y_7=0,1,2.\n\nBut we want to be high, so y_7=2.\n\nSo a_6=U, y_7=2.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nFrom y_5=2, if a_5=U, y_6=3, then a_6=D, y_7=2.\n\ny_6=3.\n\nIf we can be at y=3 at k=6, it's the highest possible for k=6 under constraint.\n\nThen y_7=2.\n\nAt k=8 and k=9, we stay at y=2.\n\nThen from k=9 y=2, we go up to y=3 at k=10, etc., to y=9 at k=16.\n\nBut at k=9, when we are at y=2, we can go up immediately after.\n\nBut is there a way to be on y=9 at k=9? No.\n\nPerhaps after k=9, we can go faster, but no.\n\nAnother idea: at k=8 or k=9, be on y=9, but impossible.\n\nOr, since y=9 is safe, if we can reach it before k=8, but we can't.\n\nEarliest k=10, but as we saw, impossible because of the step before.\n\nSo minimal is k=16 for y=9.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on y=2.\n\ny=2 has a car, but only unsafe at k=2, so at other times safe.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have a_2=U, to y_3=2 at k=3, safe.\n\nThen we go to y_4=3 at k=4, safe.\n\ny_5=4 at k=5, safe.\n\nBut at k=5, y=4, but we need to set action for a_5.\n\nIn the first path, a_5=D to y_6=3.\n\nThen a_6=D to y_7=2.\n\nBut a_6=D from y=3 to y=2.\n\nThen a_7=S, y_8=2\n\na_8=S, y_9=2\n\na_9=U, y_10=3\n\na_10=U, y_11=4\n\n...\n\nup to a_15=U, y_16=9\n\nH=15 actions from t=2 to t=16.\n\nt from 2 to 16 inclusive, that's 15 actions.\n\ny_{2+15-1}=y_16=9.\n\nBut we can reduce by not going down so early.\n\nFor example, at k=5, instead of going down, we can stay or up, but then at k=6 we are higher, but we have to come down.\n\nSuppose at k=5 y=4, we go down to y=3 at k=6 with a_5=D, same as before.\n\nIf we go up to y=5 at k=6, then we can only go to y=4,5,6 at k=7, not low, so we must go down multiple times, but from k=6 to k=7 only one action, so we can only decrease by one, to y=4, which is not 0,1,2.\n\nSo we cannot reach y=0,1,2 at k=7 from y=5 at k=6.\n\nThus, the highest we can be at k=6 is y=3, as above.\n\nThen we have to be at y=2 at k=7.\n\nSimilarly, for k=8 and k=9, we stay at y=2 to avoid moving to unsafe y.\n\nThen start going up at k=9 to k=10.\n\nBut at k=9, when we go up to y=3 at k=10, it's safe.\n\nNow, the sequence has many S actions at k=7 and k=8, but we can use those turns to go down or something, but we need to be at low y anyway.\n\nPerhaps go down to y=1 at k=8 or k=9, but that doesn't help, since we need to go up later.\n\nSo minimal H is 15.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier by being at y=2 at k=9 and then going up, but it takes 7 up from there.\n\nUnless we can be higher than y=2 at k=9, but at k=9, we must be on y=0,1,2, so y=2 is highest.\n\nSo I think H=15 is the best.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 2, there is a car, but only unsafe at k=2, so no problem.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need the action sequence.\n\nIn the above sequence:\n\nActions:\n\nt=2 (k=2): a_2 = U  (y from 1 to 2)\n\nIn terms of actions: a_t for t starting from t_1=2.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 2: a_2 = U  (y_3=2)\n\nTurn 3: a_3 = U  (y_4=3)\n\nTurn 4: a_4 = U  (y_5=4)\n\nTurn 5: a_5 = D  (y_6=3)  // going down to prepare for low\n\nTurn 6: a_6 = D  (y_7=2)  // down to y=2\n\nTurn 7: a_7 = S  (y_8=2)  // stay at y=2 for k=8\n\nTurn 8: a_8 = S  (y_9=2)  // stay for k=9\n\nThen from here, go up:\n\nTurn 9: a_9 = U  (y_10=3)\n\nTurn 10: a_10 = U (y_11=4)\n\nTurn 11: a_11 = U (y_12=5)\n\nTurn 12: a_12 = U (y_13=6)\n\nTurn 13: a_13 = U (y_14=7)\n\nTurn 14: a_14 = U (y_15=8)\n\nTurn 15: a_15 = U (y_16=9)\n\nNow, at turn t=2+H-1=2+15-1=16, y_16=9, so H=15.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t=2 to t=16? t=2 to t=16 is 15 actions: t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16? t=2 to t=16 inclusive is 15 actions? 16-2+1=15, yes.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{2+15-1}=y_16=9.\n\nAnd at each turn, no collision.\n\nFor example, at k=4, y=3, safe.\n\nk=5, y=4, safe.\n\nk=6, y=3, safe.\n\nk=7, y=2, safe.\n\nk=8, y=2, safe.\n\nk=9, y=2, safe.\n\nk=10, y=3, safe, etc.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut can we make it shorter?\n\nSuppose at k=7, we are at y=2, then at k=8, instead of staying, we go down to y=1, but that might not help.\n\nOr at k=9, go down, but worse.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid going down at k=5 and k=6 by staying lower earlier.\n\nFor example, start at k=2 y=1.\n\na_2=S, y_3=1  // stay\n\nk=3 y=1, safe.\n\na_3=U, y_4=2  // to avoid y=1 at k=4\n\nk=4 y=2, safe.\n\na_4=U, y_5=3\n\nk=5 y=3, safe (y=1 unsafe, but y=3 ok)\n\na_5=S, y_6=3  // stay at y=3\n\nk=6 y=3, safe.\n\na_6=D, y_7=2  // down to y=2\n\nThen same as before, a_7=S, y_8=2\n\na_8=S, y_9=2\n\nThen up same.\n\nBut now at k=5, we have a_5=S, so y_6=3, then a_6=D to y_7=2, same as before with a_5=D and a_6=D in previous, but here a_5=S, so we have an extra stay, but y is the same at k=6.\n\nIn previous with a_5=D from y_5=4 to y_6=3, here from y_5=3 to y_6=3 with S, then to y_7=2, so we have y=3 at k=6 instead of y=4, but we end up at y=2 at k=7 same.\n\nBut in terms of reaching y=9, it takes the same time, since from k=9 y=2, we start up.\n\nIn this case, with a_5=S, we have one more action? No.\n\nIn this sequence: a_2=S, a_3=U, a_4=U, a_5=S, a_6=D, a_7=S, a_8=S, a_9=U, ..., up to a_15=U? Let's count.\n\nActions: t=2 to t=?\n\nFrom y_7=2 at k=7.\n\nThen a_7=S, y_8=2\n\na_8=S, y_9=2\n\na_9=U, y_10=3\n\n...\n\na_14=U, y_15=8? After a_9=U, y10=3; a10=U y11=4; a11=U y12=5; a12=U y13=6; a13=U y14=7; a14=U y15=8; a15=U y16=9.\n\nSame as before, 15 actions.\n\nWith a_2=S instead of U, we have y_3=1, then y_4=2, so at k=3 y=1, which is fine, but we reach y=4 later or something, but finally same.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nThus minimal H=15.\n\nBut in the first sequence, with a_2=U, we reach y_5=4, then down, but still y_9=2.\n\nIn both cases, we are at y=2 at k=9.\n\nThen up to y=9 at k=16.\n\nSo I think it's fixed.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=0 at some point, but that would make it worse.\n\nSo the sequence can be as above.\n\nNow for the answer format.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to list actions from t_1=2.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 4 to 8 are the same, but we didn't go there early.\n\nIn the action sequence, we have turns from 2 to 16.\n\nBut H=15.\n\nNow, let's write the actions:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U? Actions up to t=16, but y_16=9 after a_15? Let's list positions.\n\nStart t=2, y_2=1\n\na_2=U: y_3=2\n\na_3=U: y_4=3\n\na_4=U: y_5=4\n\na_5=D: y_6=3\n\na_6=D: y_7=2\n\na_7=S: y_8=2\n\na_8=S: y_9=2\n\na_9=U: y_10=3\n\na_10=U: y_11=4\n\na_11=U: y_12=5\n\na_12=U: y_13=6\n\na_13=U: y_14=7\n\na_14=U: y_15=8\n\na_15=U: y_16=9\n\nNow, y_{16} =9, and t_1 + H -1 =2 + H -1, set equal to 16, so 2+H-1=16, H-1=14, H=15.\n\nActions at t=2 to t=16, but t=2 to t=16 is 15 actions? t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16: that's 15 actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, a_2 to a_16, but a_16 is not used, because after a_15, y_16 is set, and at turn 16, position is y_16=9, which is what we want for y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{16}.\n\nThe action a_t for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so for H=15, t from 2 to 2+14=16.\n\na_{16} is the last action, which sets y_{17}, but we don't care.\n\nIn this case, after a_15, y_16=9, so at turn t=16, y_16=9.\n\nWe don't need a_{16}.\n\nThe sequence should be actions for t=2 to t=16, but a_{16} would be for moving from y_16, but since we are already at y_16=9, we might not need an action, but the sequence includes actions up to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn the definition: actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter that, at time t_1 + H, position is set, but we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn this case, with actions from t=2 to t=16 (t_1 + H -1 =2+15-1=16), so at turn 16, before action a_16, y_16 is the position.\n\nIn the sequence above, after a_15, y_16=9, so at turn 16, y_16=9, before any action.\n\nThen we apply a_16, but if we do nothing or S, y_17=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 16, we can set a_16=S or something, but since y_16=9, it's fine.\n\nIn the action list, we have a_t for t=2 to 16.\n\nBut in the position, at turn t, y_t.\n\nAfter a_{t-1}, y_t is set.\n\nFor example, at turn 2, y_2=1 (initial)\n\nAfter a_2, y_3 set.\n\nAt turn 3, position y_3, and so on.\n\nAt turn 16, y_16=9, which is what we need.\n\nThe last action is a_{16}, which is applied at turn 16, setting y_{17}.\n\nBut since we need y_{16}=9, and it is set before a_{16}, we can have a_{16} anything, but to be safe, we can set S.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 16, action a_16, but y_16 is already 9, so if we set a_16=S, y_17=9, fine.\n\nIn the minimal sequence, we might not need the last action if it's redundant, but here we have to specify H actions.\n\nIn this case, with 15 actions, we reach y_16=9 at turn 16.\n\nThe actions include a_{16}, which is the 15th action.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, for H=15, t=0 to 14, times t_1 +0=2 to t_1+14=16.\n\nSo a_2 to a_{16}.\n\nNow, in the position, after a_{15}, y_{16}=9? a_t applied at time t.\n\nAt time t, apply a_t, set y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at time 16, apply a_{16}, set y_{17}.\n\nBut we need y_{16} at turn 16.\n\ny_{16} is set by a_{15}, applied at time 15.\n\nLet's clarify the timeline.\n\nTurn number t: at turn t, position is (0, y_t)\n\nThen we apply action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t if y_t is on freeway 1-8 and car covers x=0 at t.\n\nWe start at t=2, y_2=1.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{2 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, to have y_9=9, we need to be at y=8 at t=8 with a_8=U, so y_9=9.\n\nBut in general.\n\nIn our case, with actions a_2 to a_{15}, applied at t=2 to 15, setting y_3 to y_{16}.\n\ny_{16} is set at t=15 after a_{15}.\n\nThen at turn t=16, position y_{16}=9.\n\nThen we need y_{2+H-1}=y_{16}=9, so 2+H-1=16, H-1=14, H=15.\n\nThe last action is a_{15}, applied at t=15.\n\nThen for t=16, we don't apply action, or we apply a_{16}, but in the sequence, actions up to t= t_1 + H -1 =16, so a_{16} is included.\n\nIn the action list, for turn 16, we specify a_{16}, but since y_{16}=9, we can set a_{16}=S, so y_{17}=9, no issue.\n\nIn the sequence I have, a_15=U sets y_16=9, then a_{16} can be S.\n\nBut in the list, we need to include it.\n\nIn the minimal path, we have 15 actions to reach y_16=9.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nBut in the sequence, we can have a shorter H if we reach earlier, but I think not.\n\nPerhaps from the beginning, go down to y=0, but that takes more time.\n\nSo I think H=15 is minimal.\n\nNow for the car on freeway 2, we have it only unsafe at k=2, so in our path, we are on y=2 at k=3,4,8, etc., all safe.\n\nSimilarly other freeways.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nAnd for turn 16: since we need to specify, but in the above, after a_15=U, y_16=9, then for a_16, we can set S, but it's not necessary for reaching, but to have the action, set a_16=S.\n\nBut in the position, at turn 16, y_16=9, which is what we need for y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nWith actions from t=2 to t=16, that includes a_16.\n\nWhen we apply a_16 at turn 16, it sets y_17, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 16, action a_16=S is fine.\n\nBut in terms of the minimal H, since we reach at turn 16 with 15 actions, but H is the number of actions, and we have actions up to a_{16}, which is the 15th action.\n\nt from 0 to 14 for H=15, times 2 to 16.\n\na_{16} is applied at turn 16.\n\nBut y_{16} is set before turn 16.\n\nPerhaps it's acceptable.\n\nTo avoid confusion, we can set the actions such that at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9 with a stay or something.\n\nBut in this case, with H=15, y_{16}=9.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach in fewer turns.\n\nSuppose we are at y=2 at k=9, but we go up faster, but still need 7 up.\n\nUnless we can be at y=9 at k=9, impossible.\n\nAnother idea: at k=8, since we are at y=2, and y=2 is safe, but at k=9, we need to be low, so we stay.\n\nBut after k=9, no restriction, so we can go up.\n\nBut from y=2 to y=9, min 7 turns.\n\nSo from k=9 y=2 to k=16 y=9.\n\nThus minimal.\n\nPerhaps start by going down to y=0 to wait, but that might not help.\n\nFor example, at k=2, go down to y=0 at k=3, then stay or something, but then we need to go up to y=2 by k=7, which takes time, and we might miss the high position.\n\nFor instance, k=2 y=1, a_2=D, y_3=0\n\nThen at k=3 y=0, safe.\n\na_3=S, y_4=0\n\nk=4 y=0, safe.\n\na_4=U, y_5=1, but at k=5, y=1 unsafe! Collision.\n\nCannot.\n\na_4=U to y_5=1 at k=5, unsafe.\n\nSo must not be on y=1 at k=5.\n\nAt k=4, from y=0, a_4=U to y_5=1, unsafe.\n\na_4=S to y_5=0, or D not possible.\n\na_4=S, y_5=0\n\nThen a_5=U, y_6=1, but at k=6, y=1 safe? k=6, y=1 safe since unsafe only k=4,5.\n\nSo a_5=U, y_6=1\n\nk=6 y=1, safe.\n\nThen a_6=U, y_7=2\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut we reached y_7=2 later, so to go up to y=9 takes more turns.\n\nFor example, a_7=S, y_8=2\n\na_8=S, y_9=2\n\na_9=U, y_10=3\n\n...\n\na_15=U, y_16=8? From y_10=3 to y_16=9? y_10=3, y_11=4, y_12=5, y_13=6, y_14=7, y_15=8, y_16=9 after a_15=U.\n\ny_16=9, same as before, but we started with down, so actions from t=2 to t=15? Let's see:\n\nActions: t=2: D (y3=0)\n\nt=3: S (y4=0)\n\nt=4: S? a_4=S, y5=0\n\nt=5: U (y6=1)\n\nt=6: U (y7=2)\n\nt=7: S (y8=2)\n\nt=8: S (y9=2)\n\nt=9: U (y10=3)\n\nt=10: U (y11=4)\n\n...\n\nt=15: U (y16=9)\n\nNow actions from t=2 to t=15, that's 14 actions? t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15: 14 actions.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{2 + H -1}\n\nWith H=14, y_{2+14-1}=y_{15}\n\nIn this sequence, y_15 = ? After a_14, y_15 is set.\n\nIn the sequence: after a_14=U, y_15=?\n\nFrom above: after a_13=U? List:\n\nAfter a_9=U: y10=3\n\na10=U: y11=4\n\na11=U: y12=5\n\na12=U: y13=6\n\na13=U: y14=7\n\na14=U: y15=8\n\ny15=8\n\nThen a15=U: y16=9\n\nBut at turn t=15, y15=8, not 9.\n\nWe need y_{2+H-1}=9.\n\nWith H=14, y_{2+14-1}=y_{15}=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y_{15}=9, we need y_{14}=8 with a_{14}=U, so y_{15}=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, at k=14, if y14=8, safe, then a14=U to y15=9.\n\nBut we need to be at y14=8.\n\nIn the detour path, we are at y7=2, then after several U, at k=14 y= something.\n\nFrom y7=2, a7=U, y8=3; but at k=8, y=3 unsafe! Collision.\n\nIn this path, at k=8, we are at y=2 with a7=S, y8=2.\n\nThen a8=S, y9=2\n\na9=U, y10=3\n\na10=U, y11=4\n\na11=U, y12=5\n\na12=U, y13=6\n\na13=U, y14=7\n\na14=U, y15=8\n\ny15=8\n\nThen to have y15=9, not yet.\n\nWith a14=U, y15=8, not 9.\n\nThen a15=U, y16=9.\n\nBut with H=15 actions including a15.\n\ny_{16}=9.\n\nIn the first sequence, we have the same number of actions.\n\nSo I think H=15 is correct.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nIn the sequence, we can output.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 4 to 8 have cars, but in our path, we only go to y=4 at some point, but safe.\n\nSo the minimal sequence is as above.\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the initial position.\n\nPlayer at (0,1) at turn t1=2.\n\nReach (0,9) at turn 16 with actions.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nAnd for turn 16: we need to specify a_{16}, but since we reach at turn 16, and action at turn 16 is separate, we can set a_{16}=S, but in the position, it is fine.\n\nTo have exactly H actions.\n\nWith the above, for turn 16, action is not needed for reaching, but to include in sequence.\n\nPerhaps set a_{16}=S.\n\nBut in the output, it should be fine.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nSo the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) is 15, considering the need to avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe car configurations and their unsafe times are as follows:\n- Freeway \\(y = 1\\): Unsafe at turns 4 and 5 due to the car \\((-12, -23, \\text{right}, 6)\\).\n- Freeway \\(y = 2\\): Unsafe only at turn 2 due to the car \\((24, -11, \\text{right}, 36)\\).\n- Freeways \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\): Unsafe at turns 8 and 9 due to the car \\((-36, -47, \\text{right}, 6)\\).\n\nTo reach \\(y = 9\\) safely and minimally:\n- From turn 2 to turn 4, move up to \\(y = 4\\) by turn 5, avoiding the unsafe state on \\(y = 1\\) at turns 4 and 5.\n- At turn 5, move down to \\(y = 3\\) to prepare for lower positions at critical turns 8 and 9.\n- At turn 6, move down to \\(y = 2\\) to ensure safety at turn 7.\n- At turns 7 and 8, stay at \\(y = 2\\) to avoid unsafe freeways \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at turns 8 and 9.\n- At turn 9, stay at \\(y = 2\\) for the same reason.\n- From turn 10 onwards, move up consecutively to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 16.\n\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t}\\}_{t=2}^{16}\\) ensures no collisions and reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 16 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 2 + 15 - 1 = 16\\)).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 2: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ S} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways from y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays, and the cars move left or right based on their direction and speed.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each turn relative to x=0, since that's where collisions happen. Collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and there's a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nThe player position is vertical, so for each turn, the y-coordinate determines which freeway we're on. The grid is from y=0 to y=9, and freeways are y=1 to y=8. y=0 and y=9 might be safe or something, but the goal is to reach (0,9), and we start from (0,3). y=0 is not a freeway, I think, since freeways start from y=1. Similarly, y=9 might be the top, no freeway there.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, …, 8.\" So when the player is on y=0 or y=9, there are no cars, so it's safe. But we need to reach (0,9), which is y=9.\n\nNow, the car movement: for left-moving cars, span moves left, for right-moving, span moves right. All cars here are right-moving, I think. Let me check the car states.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFreeway 1: three cars, all right, speed 6.\n\nFreeway 2: one car, right, speed 36.\n\nFreeways 3 to 8: each has two cars, both right, speed 6.\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so they are moving to the right.\n\nFor a right-moving car, at turn T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], since head and tail, I need to be careful with head and tail.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nRight-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd since it's moving right, h should be greater than τ, I assume, so [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right.\n\nIn freeway 1, one car has (h,τ) = (0, -11), so at t1, span is [-11, 0]? Let's see the notation.\n\nIt says: Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor right-moving, direction right, so Span(t1) should be [τ, h] if we think τ is left end, h is right end.\n\nIn the update rule, for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSimilarly, for the car with (h,τ) = (0, -11), at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-11, 0], so it covers from -11 to 0 at t1.\n\nAt turn t1, for this car, 0 is in the span, since [-11,0] includes 0.\n\nBut the player is at (0,3) at turn t1, which is freeway y=3? No, player position is (x,y), but x is always 0? The player is at (0,y), so when we say position, it's y that matters.\n\nAt turn t1, player is at y=3, which is freeway 3? Freeways are y=1 to y=8, so y=3 is freeway 3.\n\nBut at turn t1, for freeway 3, we need to check if there is a car with 0 in span at t1.\n\nBut collision occurs when the player is on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAt turn t1, player is on y=3, and we need to check freeway 3 for collision.\n\nSimilarly, for other turns.\n\nIn the collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the freeway the player is on at turn T.\n\nSo at each turn T, when player is on y_T, we need that for the freeway y_T, no car has 0 in its span at time T.\n\nNow, for freeway 3 at t1: cars are (-24,-35,right,6) and (24,13,right,6). Let's list for each freeway at t1.\n\nt1 is given as current turn, t0=4, so t1=4.\n\nThe problem says: \"Current Turn: t0 = 4\" and \"Player Position: (0,3)\" so turn t1 is 4, I think.\n\nIt says \"suppose current turn is {t1}\", but in the task, it says \"Current Turn: t0 = 4\", so t1 = t0 = 4? Let's see.\n\n\"Current Turn: t0 = 4\" and \"Player Position: (0,3)\" so at turn 4, player is at y=3.\n\nAnd we need to find actions from turn t1=4 onwards.\n\nIn the sequence, actions a_t for t from t1 to t1+H-1, I think.\n\nSequence {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t=0, a_{t1}, t=1, a_{t1+1}, etc., up to a_{t1+H-1}, and after H turns, at turn t1+H, position is y_{t1+H}, but we need to reach y=9 at some turn, and H is the number of actions, so after H actions, we are at turn t1+H with position y_{t1+H}.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, player is at position (0, y_t), then chooses action a_t, then moves to new position at turn t+1: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nThe player update is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t depending on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, before action, position is (0,y_t), then after action, at turn t+1, position is (0,y_{t+1}).\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T when the player is on y_T.\n\nFor collision at turn T: when player is at position (0,y_T) at turn T, and if for freeway y_T, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nThen, if collision, game over, I assume.\n\nWe need to avoid that.\n\nAlso, note that if you move to a different y, you are not on the new y until the next turn.\n\nThe note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nAt turn T, you are on y_T. You choose action to go to y_{T+1}. But during turn T, you are still on y_T, so collision check is for y_T at time T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and collision check for y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nIf you stay on the same y, you are on it both turns, but since position changes at turn boundary, I think for each turn, you are on one y for that turn.\n\nAt turn T, position is (0,y_T), so on freeway y_T if 1≤y_T≤8.\n\nThen after action, at turn T+1, position is (0,y_{T+1}), on freeway y_{T+1} if 1≤y_T+1≤8.\n\nBack to the cars.\n\nFirst, I need to find for each freeway, when is 0 in the span of a car on that freeway.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving with constant speed, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] for a car with initial (τ,h) at t1.\n\nt1 is 4.\n\nLet ΔT = T - t1 = T - 4.\n\nFor each car, at time T, span is [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT]\n\n0 is in span if τ + s ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + s ΔT.\n\nSince for right-moving, τ < h, so the inequality is τ + s ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + s ΔT.\n\n0 is in [L, R] if L ≤ 0 ≤ R.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all right.\n\nNow, for each freeway, list the cars and their τ, h, s.\n\nFreeway 1: k=1\n\nCar 1: h=-42, τ=-53, d=right, s=6\n\nAt t1, span [τ, h] = [-53, -42]? No.\n\nThe notation is (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor direction right, head is the right end, tail is left end, so Span(t1) = [τ, h]\n\nWith τ < h.\n\nFor car1: h=-42, τ=-53, so τ=-53, h=-42, so span at t1: [-53, -42]\n\nSimilarly, car2: h=36, τ=25, d=right, s=6, span at t1: [25,36]\n\nCar3: h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=6, span at t1: [-11, 0]\n\nFor freeway 1, at t1=4, car3 has span [-11,0], which includes 0.\n\nBut player is at y=3 at t1, not y=1, so no collision for player at t1.\n\nBut for freeway 1, when is 0 occupied.\n\nFor car3: span at T: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-11 + 6 ΔT, 0 + 6 ΔT] = [-11 + 6 ΔT, 6 ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 6 ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 6 ΔT\n\nSince 6 ΔT ≥ 0 for ΔT≥0, 0 ≤ 6 ΔT is true for ΔT ≥ 0, and -11 + 6 ΔT ≤ 0 implies 6 ΔT ≤ 11, ΔT ≤ 11/6 ≈ 1.833, so ΔT ≤ 1 since integer turns.\n\nΔT = T - t1, T and t1 integers, so ΔT integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ 6 ΔT always for ΔT ≥ 0.\n\n-11 + 6 ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 6 ΔT ≤ 11 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 11/6 ≈1.833, so for ΔT ≤ 1.\n\nAlso, for ΔT=0, -11 ≤0≤0, true.\n\nΔT=1: -11+6= -5 ≤0 ≤6, true.\n\nΔT=2: -11+12=1 ≤0? 1 ≤ 0 false, and 0≤12 true, but 1 ≤0 false, so not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, for car1: span at T: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-53 + 6 ΔT, -42 + 6 ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -53 +6ΔT ≤0 ≤ -42 +6ΔT\n\nBut -42 +6ΔT, for ΔT≥0, -42+6ΔT ≤ -42 <0? -42 +6ΔT, when is this >=0?\n\n-42 +6ΔT ≥0 when 6ΔT≥42, ΔT≥7.\n\nThen lower bound -53+6ΔT ≤0, which for ΔT≥7, -53+42= -11≤0 true, but upper bound -42+6ΔT, for ΔT=7: -42+42=0, so 0≤0 true, so occupied at ΔT=7.\n\nSimilarly for other ΔT.\n\nBut we care about when 0 is covered for each freeway.\n\nSimilarly car2: [25 +6ΔT, 36+6ΔT], both positive for ΔT≥0, so 25+6ΔT >0, so 0 not in span ever for car2.\n\nSo for freeway 1, cars that can cover 0: car3 at ΔT=0 and 1, and car1 at ΔT=7, etc. but for now, at ΔT=0, car3 covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nBut we need for each freeway, the times when 0 is occupied by some car.\n\nFreeway 1:\n\n- Car3: covers 0 at ΔT=0 and ΔT=1\n\n- Car1: covers 0 when -53+6ΔT ≤0 ≤ -42+6ΔT\n\n0 ≤ -42+6ΔT ⇒ 6ΔT ≥42 ⇒ ΔT ≥7\n\n-53+6ΔT ≤0 ⇒ 6ΔT≤53 ⇒ ΔT≤53/6≈8.833, so ΔT≤8\n\nFor ΔT=7: lower -53+42= -11≤0, upper -42+42=0≤0, true\n\nΔT=8: lower -53+48= -5≤0, upper -42+48=6≥0, true\n\nΔT=9: lower -53+54=1≤0?

ΔT=4,5 is for future.\n\nAt T=4, ΔT=0.\n\nFor freeway 3, at ΔT=0: is it occupied?\n\nFrom above, for y=3, at ΔT=0: from car, [ -35 +6*0, -24 +6*0] = [-35,-24], which is all negative, 0 not in, so not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, second car [13,24], not.\n\nSo at ΔT=0, y=3 is not occupied, so player is safe at T=4.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf we go up, to y=4 at next turn.\n\nBut we need to see when we can be on which y without collision.\n\nAlso, we can stay or go down, but going down might not help since we need to go up.\n\ny=3 to y=9, up is better.\n\nBut at certain times, some freeways are occupied.\n\nNow, let's list for each ΔT, which y are occupied.\n\nΔT | occupied y\n\n0: y=1 is occupied (since at ΔT=0, y=1 has car covering 0)\n\nAt ΔT=0: y=1 occupied, others not.\n\ny=1 at ΔT=0: yes, from car3.\n\ny=2 not at ΔT=0, since only at ΔT=2.\n\ny=3 not at ΔT=0, as above.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nΔT=0: occupied y: 1\n\nΔT=1: y=1 occupied (car3 at ΔT=1)\n\ny=2 not\n\ny=3 not, etc.\n\nΔT=1: y=1 occupied\n\nΔT=2: y=2 occupied (only y=2)\n\nΔT=3: no occupied? y=1 not, y=2 not (only ΔT=2), y=3 not until ΔT=4, so at ΔT=3, all freeways clear?\n\ny=1: occupied at ΔT=0,1,7,8; not at ΔT=3\n\ny=2: only at ΔT=2, not at ΔT=3\n\ny=3: at ΔT=4,5; not at ΔT=3\n\nSimilarly y=4 to8 only at ΔT=4,5\n\nSo at ΔT=3, no freeway is occupied, all clear.\n\nΔT=4: y=3,4,5,6,7,8 all occupied\n\nΔT=5: same, y=3 to8 occupied\n\nΔT=6: no? y=1 not, y=2 not, y=3 to8 not occupied except at ΔT=4,5, so at ΔT=6, all clear.\n\nΔT=7: y=1 occupied\n\nΔT=8: y=1 occupied\n\nΔT=9 and above, not relevant, but y=1 at ΔT=7,8, etc.\n\nNow, player starts at T=4, ΔT=0, y=3, which is safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 safe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=3, minimum 6 up actions, but we might need to wait or something to avoid occupied times.\n\nSince we can only change y by -1,0,+1 per turn.\n\nStart at y=3, ΔT=0.\n\nAfter each action, we move to next turn.\n\nLet me denote the state at turn T: position y_T, and time ΔT = T-4.\n\nAt T=4, ΔT=0, y=3.\n\nWe choose action a_4, then at T=5, ΔT=1, y_5 = y_4 + Δy_4.\n\nThen at T=5, we are on y_5, and check collision for that freeway at ΔT=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nFirst, if we go up directly: all U.\n\nThen:\n\nStart T=4, ΔT=0, y=3: safe, since y=3 not occupied at ΔT=0.\n\nAction a_4 = U, so y_5 = 3 +1 =4\n\nAt T=5, ΔT=1, y=4\n\nNow y=4 is freeway, and at ΔT=1, is it occupied? From above, at ΔT=1, only y=1 occupied, y=4 not, so safe.\n\nAction a_5 = U, y_6 =4+1=5\n\nT=6, ΔT=2, y=5\n\nAt ΔT=2, occupied y: only y=2, y=5 not occupied, so safe.\n\nAction a_6 = U, y_7 =5+1=6\n\nT=7, ΔT=3, y=6\n\nAt ΔT=3, no freeway occupied, all clear, so safe.\n\nAction a_7 = U, y_8 =6+1=7\n\nT=8, ΔT=4, y=7\n\nAt ΔT=4, y=7 is occupied (since y=3-8 all occupied at ΔT=4)\n\ny=7 is freeway, and occupied, so collision! Not safe.\n\nIf we go U at T=7 to y=7 at T=8, ΔT=4, occupied.\n\nSo collision.\n\nThus, cannot go directly up at that point.\n\nNeed to avoid being on y=3 to 8 at ΔT=4 and 5.\n\nΔT=4 and 5 are T=8 and T=9.\n\nSince T=4 is ΔT=0, T=5 ΔT=1, T=6 ΔT=2, T=7 ΔT=3, T=8 ΔT=4, T=9 ΔT=5.\n\nAt T=8 (ΔT=4) and T=9 (ΔT=5), all y=3 to8 are occupied.\n\nSo we need not to be on any of y=3 to8 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nThat means, at turn T=8 and T=9, player must be on y<3 or y>8, i.e., y=0,1,2 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, so if we can reach y=9 before T=8, or at T=8 but y=9 not freeway, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0,1,2: y=0 and y=2 are freeways? y=0 is not freeway, safe. y=1 and y=2 are freeways, but they might be occupied at some times.\n\nSpecifically, at T=8, ΔT=4, y=1 is not occupied? y=1 occupied at ΔT=0,1,7,8; ΔT=4 not, so y=1 safe at ΔT=4.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 occupied only at ΔT=2, not at ΔT=4.\n\nSo at ΔT=4, y=1 and y=2 are safe, since not occupied.\n\ny=0 safe, y=9 safe.\n\nBut y=3 to8 occupied.\n\nSimilarly at ΔT=5, same.\n\nSo for T=8 (ΔT=4), we can be on y=0,1,2 or y=9.\n\nSimilarly for T=9 (ΔT=5).\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nWe start at T=4, y=3.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nIf we can reach y=9 by T=7 or earlier, we avoid the bad times.\n\nT=7 is ΔT=3, which is safe for all.\n\nAt T=7, ΔT=3, all freeways clear, so we can be on any y.\n\nBut from y=3 to y=9 in 3 turns? From T=4 to T=7 is 3 actions: if all U, from y=3 to y=6 at T=7.\n\ny_4=3, after a_4 U, y_5=4; a_5 U, y_6=5; a_6 U, y_7=6.\n\nAt T=7, y=6, which is fine, since ΔT=3 safe.\n\nThen from there, to reach y=9, need 3 more U: but at T=8, if we go to y=7, occupied.\n\nWe can stay or go down, but we need to go up.\n\nAt T=7, y=6, we could go S, stay at y=6 for T=8, but at T=8, y=6, ΔT=4, occupied, collision.\n\nGo D to y=5 at T=8, but y=5 occupied.\n\nSimilarly, any y from 3 to8 occupied at T=8.\n\nSo if we are on y=3-8 at T=8, collision.\n\nTherefore, we must not be on y=3-8 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nThat means by T=8, we must be at y=0,1,2 or y=9.\n\nSimilarly for T=9.\n\nBut since we start at y=3, and need to go to y=9, which is above.\n\nWe can go down to y=2 or below to be safe at T=8, then go up later.\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\nWe can try to reach y=9 before T=8.\n\nT=8 is turn 8.\n\nCurrent turn T=4.\n\nFrom T=4 to T=8 is 4 actions.\n\nStart y=3, after 4 U actions: y_5=4, y_6=5, y_7=6, y_8=7, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 in 4 actions, we need to go up 6 steps, but each action only +1 max, so impossible to reach in less than 6 actions from y=3.\n\ny=3 to y=9, difference 6, so minimum 6 actions to go from 3 to 9.\n\nEach action can increase y by at most 1, so at least 6 actions needed.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn T = t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nWith H actions, we start from turn t1, after H actions, at turn t1 + H.\n\nFor example, with H=6, we can reach at turn t1+6 = 4+6=10.\n\nBut at turn 10, ΔT=6, which is safe, but we might reach earlier if possible, but minimum 6 actions.\n\nBut during the path, we need to avoid collision.\n\nNow, the critical point is T=8 and T=9, ΔT=4 and 5, where y=3-8 occupied.\n\nSo for turns T=8 and T=9, player must not be on y=3 to 8.\n\nThat is, at those turns, y_T must be in {0,1,2,9}.\n\ny=9 is the goal, so if we can reach y=9 by T=8, that would be good, but T=8 is turn 8, from turn 4, 4 actions: max y=3+4=7, not 9.\n\nAfter 4 actions, at T=8, y <= 3+4=7.\n\nSimilarly, after 5 actions, at T=9, y <= 3+5=8.\n\ny=8 is freeway and occupied at T=9, so if at T=9 y=8, collision.\n\nAfter 6 actions, at T=10, y<=9, but can be 9.\n\nNow, to be safe at T=8 and T=9, since we cannot be on y=3-8, and we can only be on y=0,1,2 or y=9.\n\nBut at T=8, we can be at y=0,1,2.\n\nAt T=9, similarly.\n\nBut y=9 at T=8 impossible, since max y=7 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly at T=9, max y=8, which is occupied if we reach, but y=8 at T=9 is occupied, so we cannot be at y=8 at T=9.\n\nIf we reach y=9 at T=9, that would be good, but from start, after 5 actions, at T=9, y <= 3+5=8, so y=8 max at T=9.\n\ny=8 at T=9: ΔT=5, occupied, collision.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be at y=9 at T=9 or earlier with the actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1+H.\n\nt1=4.\n\nAt turn T, after H actions, T = t1 + H? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t1, before action, position y_{t1}.\n\nAfter choosing a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t1+1}, at turn t1+2, y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy_{t1+1}\n\nSo after K actions, we are at turn t1 + K, position y_{t1 + K}.\n\nTo have y_{t1 + K} = 9.\n\nFrom y_{t1} =3, we need to increase by 6, so K >=6.\n\nIf K=6, at turn t1+6=10, y=9 possible.\n\nIf K=7, at turn 11, etc., but we want min H, so K=6.\n\nBut with K=6, at turn 10.\n\nDuring turns t1 to t1+5, we need to avoid collision.\n\nThe turns we need to worry about are T=5,6,7,8,9,10? But at T=10, y=9 safe.\n\nT=8 and T=9 are critical because y=3-8 occupied at ΔT=4 and 5, i.e., T=8 and T=9.\n\nAt other times, we can be on freeways if not occupied.\n\nNow, for K=6, we need to go from y=3 to y=9 in 6 actions, so all U, but we saw that at T=8, if we are on y=7, occupied, but T=8 is turn 8.\n\nLet's list the turns:\n\nT: turn number\n\nΔT = T - 4\n\ny_T: position at turn T\n\nAt T=4, ΔT=0, y=3: safe (y=3 not occupied)\n\nWe choose a_4, then y_5 = y_4 + a_4 effect.\n\nThen at T=5, we have y_5, and check collision based on y_5 and ΔT=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo reach y_10=9.\n\nSince we must increase by 6, and actions U give +1, D give -1, S 0, to have net +6 in 6 actions, we need exactly 6 U and 0 D, 0 S. Because if we have S or D, we need more actions, but with K=6, if we have S or D, y would be less than 9 at turn 10.\n\nFor example, if one S, then after 6 actions, y=3 +5*1 +0 =8 <9, not 9.\n\nIf one D, y=3 +4*1 + (-1) + others, but net increase less than 6.\n\nSpecifically, let U be number of U, D number of D, S number of S, U + D + S = H.\n\nNet Δy = U - D.\n\nStart y=3, end y=9, so U - D = 6.\n\nAlso, U + D + S = H.\n\nSince U = 6 + D, then H = (6 + D) + D + S = 6 + 2D + S >=6.\n\nMin H when D=0, S=0, H=6.\n\nOtherwise H>6.\n\nSo minimal H is 6, with all U actions.\n\nBut with all U, we have collision at T=8.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nT=4, ΔT=0, y=3: safe\n\na_4 = U, y_5 =4\n\nT=5, ΔT=1, y=4: at ΔT=1, occupied y: only y=1, so y=4 safe, no collision\n\na_5 = U, y_6=5\n\nT=6, ΔT=2, y=5: occupied y: only y=2, so y=5 safe\n\na_6 = U, y_7=6\n\nT=7, ΔT=3, y=6: at ΔT=3, no occupied freeway, so safe\n\na_7 = U, y_8=7\n\nT=8, ΔT=4, y=7: now y=7 occupied, collision!\n\nYes.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on y=7 at T=8 or in general not on y=3-8 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nIn this path, at T=8 we are on y=7 which is bad.\n\nTo avoid, we need to be on different y at T=8.\n\nFor example, at T=8, we can be on y=0,1,2 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 at T=8 impossible.\n\nSo we must be on y=0,1, or 2 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, we must be on y=0,1,2 or y=9.\n\nNow, since we start from y=3, we need to go down to reach y=2 or below by T=8.\n\nThen from there go up to y=9.\n\nBut that will take more actions.\n\nFor example, suppose we go down at some point.\n\nLet's list the sequence.\n\nStart T=4, y=3, safe.\n\nWe need to set y_8 to be <=2 or >=9, but >=9 impossible, so <=2.\n\nSimilarly for T=9.\n\nFirst, ensure at T=8, y_8 <=2.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nBut y_8 <=2, then to reach y=9, we need at least 7 up actions, but we have from T=8 to T=10 or later.\n\ny at T=8 is <=2, say y_8 =2, then to y=9, need 7 steps? y_8=2, after action a_8, y_9 = y_8 + Δy_8, which could be 3,2,1.\n\nThen y_9, if y_9=3, but at T=9, if y_9=3, occupied, collision.\n\nIf y_9=2, then at T=9, y=2, which is freeway, and at ΔT=5, is it occupied? y=2 occupied only at ΔT=2, not at ΔT=5, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, if y_9=1, safe if not occupied.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y_8 <=2, to reach y=9, since each step +1 max, it takes at least 7 steps to go from 2 to 9? From y_8=2 to y=9, difference 7, so at least 7 actions needed after T=8? No.\n\nAt turn T=8, we are at y_8.\n\nThen after H actions from there, but we need to reach at some turn.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nTo have y_T =9 for some T.\n\nFrom y_8 <=2, the earliest to reach y=9 is at turn T=8 + 7 =15 if we go up all, but that is late.\n\nBut we can reach faster if we are higher earlier, but we are constrained.\n\nSince we must have y_8 <=2, and we start from y=3 at T=4.\n\nFrom T=4 to T=8, 4 actions.\n\nStart y=3.\n\nAfter 4 actions, at T=8, y_8.\n\ny_8 = 3 + sum_{t=4 to7} Δy_t\n\nEach Δy_t = -1,0, or +1.\n\nSo y_8 can be from 3-4= -1? But y min 0, so y_8 >=0.\n\ny_8 = 3 + net change from 4 actions.\n\nTo have y_8 <=2, net change <= -1.\n\nThat is, the sum of Δy from t=4 to7 <= -1.\n\nSince each Δy <=1, but to have net <= -1, we need some down actions or stay.\n\nThen, once y_8 <=2, safe at T=8.\n\nThen at T=9, we need y_9 to be safe, which if y_9 <=2 or y_9=9.\n\nBut y_9 = y_8 + Δy_8, and y_8 <=2, so y_9 <=3 if U, or less.\n\nIf y_9 <=2, then safe since y=0,1,2 not occupied at ΔT=5.\n\nIf y_9=3, then at T=9, y=3, ΔT=5, occupied, collision.\n\nSo we must have y_9 <=2 or y_9=9, but y_9=9 impossible from y_8<=2 in one step, so y_9 <=2.\n\nSimilarly, then we can continue to go up.\n\nBut this will take many turns.\n\nFor example, to have y_8 <=2.\n\nStart y=3.\n\nAfter 4 actions to T=8, net change <= -1.\n\nFor instance, one D and three S, or two D, etc., but we need to go up eventually.\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\nWe can reach y=9 at turn 10 with all U, but collision at T=8.\n\nTo avoid, we can delay or advance some moves.\n\nAnother idea: at T=7, we are at y=6 in the direct path, but instead of going U to y=7 at T=8, we can go S or D.\n\nBut at T=7, y=6, if we go S, then y_8=6, at T=8 occupied, collision.\n\nIf we go D, y_8=5, occupied, collision.\n\nSo no, we must not be on y=3-8 at T=8.\n\nSo at T=7, we need to be at a position such that after action, at T=8 we are <=2.\n\nBut at T=7, y=6 in direct path, to be <=2 at T=8, we need to go down a lot, but only one action, Δy = -1,0,1, so from y=6, we can go to 5,6,7 at T=8, all between 5 and 7, all occupied, so impossible to be <=2 from y=6 in one step.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on y=6 at T=7 if we want to be safe at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, we need to be lower at T=7.\n\nLet's work backwards.\n\nAt T=8, we need y_8 <=2.\n\ny_8 is determined by y_7 and a_7.\n\ny_8 = y_7 + Δy_7\n\nTo have y_8 <=2, we need y_7 + Δy_7 <=2.\n\nSince Δy_7 >= -1, so y_7 <= 3, because if y_7=4, then y_8 <=5, which may not be <=2; but we need y_8 <=2, so if y_7=4, even with D, y_8=3, which is not <=2? y_8=3>2, and 3 is in 3-8, occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if y_7=3, with D, y_8=2<=2, ok; with S, y_8=3>2 not good; with U, y_8=4 worse.\n\nIf y_7=2, then with any action, y_8=1,2,3; if U, y_8=3>2 not good; S y_8=2<=2 good; D y_8=1<=2 good.\n\nSimilarly, if y_7=1, with U y_8=2<=2 good; S y_8=1 good; D y_8=0 good.\n\nIf y_7=0, similar.\n\nBut y_7 cannot be too low because we start from 3.\n\nTo have y_8 <=2, we need that at T=7, y_7 <=2, because if y_7=3, only with D we can have y_8=2; if y_7=4, even with D, y_8=3>2 not good; similarly higher worse.\n\nSo for y_8 <=2, we must have y_7 <=2, and then choose action such that y_8 <=2.\n\nIf y_7 <=2, then with D or S, y_8 <=2; with U, y_8= y_7 +1 <=3, which if y_7=2, y_8=3>2 not good; if y_7=1, y_8=2<=2 good; if y_7=0, y_8=1<=2 good.\n\nSo to have y_8 <=2 safely, we need y_7 <=1, then with any action, y_8 <=2 (since U to 2 or less, S or D to 1 or 0).\n\nIf y_7=2, then only with S or D we can have y_8<=2; with U, y_8=3 not good.\n\nBut at T=8, y=3 is occupied, so we cannot have y_8=3.\n\nSimilarly, for other values.\n\nTo simplify, we need to be at y<=2 at T=7, then we can choose action to stay at y<=2 or go to y=3 but at T=8 y=3 occupied, so better not.\n\nIf at T=7, y_7 <=1, then y_8 = y_7 + Δy <=2, and since y_8 <=2, it is safe at T=8.\n\nThen at T=9, similarly, we need y_9 <=2 or y_9=9.\n\nBut y_9 = y_8 + Δy_8.\n\nSince y_8 <=2, y_9 <=3.\n\nIf y_9 <=2, safe at T=9.\n\nIf y_9=3, occupied at T=9, collision.\n\nSo we must have y_9 <=2.\n\nThus from y_8 <=2, we need to choose a_8 such that y_9 <=2, so if y_8 <=1, with U, y_9=2<=2; S y_9<=1; D y_9<=0.\n\nIf y_8=2, with U, y_9=3 not good; S y_9=2 good; D y_9=1 good.\n\nSo possible.\n\nThen we can go up after T=9.\n\nBut T=9 is ΔT=5, then T=10 ΔT=6, etc., all safe except y=1 at ΔT=7,8, but that is later.\n\nNow, back to start.\n\nWe need to be at y_7 <=1.\n\ny_7 is at T=7, which is after 3 actions from T=4.\n\nStart T=4, y=3.\n\nAfter 3 actions (a_4,a_5,a_6), at T=7, y_7.\n\ny_7 = 3 + sum Δy from t=4 to6.\n\nTo have y_7 <=1, net change from 3 actions <= -2.\n\nFor example, two D and one S, or one D and two S, or three D, etc.\n\nThen, with y_7 <=1, we can have y_8 <=2 as above.\n\nThen at T=8, y_8 <=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=9, we set y_9 <=2, safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up to y=9.\n\nBut this will take more than 6 actions.\n\nFor example, from T=9, y_9 <=2, to y=9, need at least 7 actions, so at turn T=9+7=16, late.\n\nBut we can be higher at some points.\n\nSince at T=7, we can be low, but then go up.\n\nBut during T=4 to T=7, we can be on freeways when they are not occupied.\n\nFor example, at T=5, ΔT=1, only y=1 occupied, so y=2 to8 safe.\n\nT=6, ΔT=2, only y=2 occupied, so y=1,3,4,5,6,7,8 safe? y=1 not occupied at ΔT=2, only y=2 occupied.\n\nAt ΔT=2, occupied y: only y=2, so other y are safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo we can move during these times.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go up as much as possible when safe, but avoid the bad times.\n\nThe bad times are T=8 and T=9 for y=3-8.\n\nSo we need to be off the freeways y=3-8 at those turns.\n\nSince we can be on y=0,1,2 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 not reachable early.\n\nSo we can go down to y=1 or 2 before T=8, stay there during T=8 and T=9, then go up.\n\nFor example, from start, go down to y=2 or lower.\n\nStart T=4, y=3, safe.\n\nAction a_4: if D, then y_5 =2\n\nT=5, ΔT=1, y=2: is y=2 occupied? At ΔT=1, only y=1 occupied, y=2 not, so safe.\n\nThen a_5: we can go D to y=1, or S to y=2, or U to y=3.\n\nBut we need to be low at T=8.\n\nIf we go to y=1 at T=5.\n\na_5 = D, then y_6 =2 + (-1) =1? At T=5, y=2, action a_5=D, then y_6=1\n\nT=6, ΔT=2, y=1: at ΔT=2, occupied y: only y=2, so y=1 not occupied, safe.\n\nThen a_6: we can go to y=0,1,2.\n\nSay a_6=D, y_7=0\n\nT=7, ΔT=3, y=0: not freeway, safe.\n\nThen a_7: we can go U to y=1, or S to y=0, etc.\n\nBut at T=7, ΔT=3, all safe.\n\nNow at T=8, we need y_8 <=2.\n\nFrom y_7=0, with U, y_8=1; S y_8=0; D not possible, y min 0.\n\nSo y_8 <=1 <=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=8, y_8=1 or 0, safe.\n\nThen a_8: say S, y_9=1 or 0\n\nT=9, ΔT=5, y=1: is it occupied? y=1 occupied at ΔT=0,1,7,8; not at ΔT=5, so safe.\n\nOr if y=0, safe.\n\nThen from there, we need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut it will take many actions.\n\nFor example, from y_9=1 at T=9, to y=9, need 8 U actions, reach at T=17.\n\nToo late.\n\nWe can be higher at T=7.\n\nFor example, at T=7, we can be at y=6, but then we cannot go down to y<=2 in one step for T=8.\n\nBut at T=7, we can be at y=2, for example.\n\nHow to be at y=2 at T=7.\n\nStart y=3 at T=4.\n\nAfter 3 actions, at T=7, y_7.\n\ny_7 = 3 + net from 3 actions.\n\nTo have y_7=2, net change -1, so one D and two S, or one S and one D one U but net -1, etc.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=4, y=3, safe.\n\na_4 = S, then y_5=3\n\nT=5, ΔT=1, y=3: safe, since only y=1 occupied.\n\na_5 = S, y_6=3\n\nT=6, ΔT=2, y=3: at ΔT=2, occupied only y=2, so y=3 safe.\n\na_6 = D, then y_7=2\n\nT=7, ΔT=3, y=2: safe, since no occupied freeway at ΔT=3.\n\nNow, at T=7, y=2.\n\nWe need for T=8, y_8 <=2.\n\nWith y_7=2, we can do a_7 = S, then y_8=2\n\nT=8, ΔT=4, y=2: is it occupied? y=2 occupied only at ΔT=2, not at ΔT=4, so safe.\n\nOr a_7 = D, y_8=1, safe.\n\nBut not U, because y_8=3 occupied.\n\nSay a_7 = S, y_8=2\n\nThen at T=9, we need y_9 <=2 or 9.\n\na_8, we can do S, y_9=2\n\nT=9, ΔT=5, y=2: occupied? Only at ΔT=2, not, so safe.\n\nThen from there, we can start going up.\n\nBut at T=9, y=2, to y=9, need 7 U actions.\n\nReach at T=16.\n\nStill late.\n\nTo reach faster, we can go up before T=7 when possible.\n\nFor example, from T=4 to T=7, we can go up to y=6, but then we stuck at T=8.\n\nUnless we go down at T=7, but from y=6, down to y=5, but at T=8 y=5 occupied.\n\nNot good.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=7, ΔT=3, all safe, we can be at high y, but then at T=8, we must be low, so we need to be low at T=7 to be low at T=8.\n\nBut at T=7, if we are high, we can't get low fast.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 at T=10 with all U, but avoid T=8 and T=9 by being on y=1 or 2.\n\nBut in the direct path, at T=8 we are on y=7, which is bad.\n\nSo we need to be on y=1 or 2 at T=8.\n\nFrom start, we can go down early.\n\nFor example, at T=4, go D to y=2 at T=5.\n\nT=4, y=3, a_4=D, y_5=2\n\nT=5, ΔT=1, y=2: safe.\n\nThen at T=5, we can go U to y=3, or S, or D.\n\nBut if we go U to y=3 at T=6.\n\nT=5, y=2, a_5=U, y_6=3\n\nT=6, ΔT=2, y=3: safe, since only y=2 occupied.\n\nThen at T=6, we can go U to y=4 at T=7.\n\na_6=U, y_7=4\n\nT=7, ΔT=3, y=4: safe.\n\nNow at T=7, y=4.\n\nWe need for T=8, y_8 <=2.\n\nFrom y=4, with one action, y_8 can be 3,4,5, all occupied at T=8, impossible to be <=2.\n\nSo not good.\n\nAt T=5, after y=2, we can go D to y=1 at T=6.\n\nT=5, y=2, a_5=D, y_6=1\n\nT=6, ΔT=2, y=1: safe.\n\nThen a_6, say S, y_7=1\n\nT=7, ΔT=3, y=1: safe.\n\nThen at T=7, y=1.\n\nThen a_7, we can go U to y=2, or S to y=1, or D to y=0.\n\nFor T=8, we need y_8 <=2.\n\nWith y_7=1, U to y=2, S to y=1, D to y=0, all <=2, safe.\n\nSay a_7=U, y_8=2\n\nT=8, ΔT=4, y=2: safe.\n\nThen at T=8, y=2.\n\na_8, for T=9, we need y_9 <=2.\n\nSo we can do S, y_9=2, or D to y=1, or U to y=3 but not good.\n\nSay a_8=S, y_9=2\n\nT=9, ΔT=5, y=2: safe.\n\nThen from T=9, y=2, we need to go to y=9.\n\n7 U actions, reach at T=16.\n\nBut we can go up faster after T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=2, we can start going up.\n\nBut H is the number of actions from t1=4 to reach y=9.\n\nAfter actions a_4 to a_{4+H-1}, at turn 4+H, y=9.\n\nFrom above, at T=9, y=2, then after 7 U, at T=16, y=9.\n\nSo H=12 actions? Actions from t=4 to t=4+H-1, at turn t=4+H, y=9.\n\nAt turn T=9, after actions a_4 to a_8, that's 5 actions, y=2 at T=9.\n\nThen from there, to reach y=9 at turn T, we need to increase by 7, so at least 7 more actions, so at turn T=9+7=16, with actions a_9 to a_15, so total actions from a_4 to a_15, that's 12 actions, H=12.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nNotice that at T=6, ΔT=2, only y=2 occupied, so we can be on other y.\n\nSimilarly, at T=7, all safe.\n\nAlso, at T=10, ΔT=6, all safe, etc.\n\nWe can be at high y at T=7, but then at T=8 we must be low, which requires that at T=7 we are already low.\n\nBut if at T=7 we are at y=2, then at T=8 we can be at y=2, then at T=9 at y=2, then start up.\n\nBut from T=4 to T=7, we can go to y=6, for example, but then we can't get down.\n\nUnless we go down earlier.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=8 and T=9 we must be on y<=2, we can go to y=2 at T=8 and T=9, but before that, we can go up to y=6 at T=7, for example, but then from y=6 to y=2 in one step impossible.\n\nSo we need to descend before T=7.\n\nFor example, at T=6, we can be at y=5, then at T=6, y=5, safe, then a_6=D, y_7=4\n\nT=7, y=4, safe.\n\nThen from y=4, we can only go to 3,4,5 at T=8, all occupied.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt T=6, be at y=3, a_6=D, y_7=2\n\nT=7, y=2, safe.\n\nThen a_7=S, y_8=2, safe.\n\na_8=S, y_9=2, safe.\n\nThen from T=9, y=2, go up.\n\nBut how to be at y=3 at T=6.\n\nStart T=4, y=3.\n\na_4=S, y_5=3\n\nT=5, a_5=S, y_6=3\n\nT=6, a_6=D, y_7=2\n\netc., as before.\n\nOr we can go up first.\n\nT=4, a_4=U, y_5=4\n\nT=5, a_5=U, y_6=5\n\nT=6, a_6=U, y_7=6\n\nT=7, y=6, safe.\n\nThen from here, to avoid T=8, we can go down, but to y=5,6,7 at T=8, all occupied.\n\nNo.\n\nSo the only way is to be low at T=7.\n\nBut if we are low at T=7, we can be higher at T=10.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at T=10 with all U, but skip the bad turn by being on safe y at T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut in all U, at T=8 we are on y=7, bad.\n\nSo we need to modify the path so that at T=8 we are on y=2, for example.\n\nBut from T=4 to T=8, with 4 actions, to go from y=3 to y=2, net change -1, so for example, three S and one D, or two S and two D, etc.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=4, y=3, a_4=S, y_5=3\n\nT=5, a_5=S, y_6=3\n\nT=6, a_6=S, y_7=3\n\nT=7, a_7=D, y_8=2\n\nT=8, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=8, y=2.\n\na_8, for T=9, y_9 must be <=2 or 9.\n\nIf we go U, y_9=3, but at T=9, y=3 occupied, collision.\n\nSo cannot go U.\n\nMust go S or D, so y_9=2 or 1 or 0.\n\nSay a_8=S, y_9=2\n\nT=9, y=2, safe.\n\nThen from here, we can go U to y=3 at T=10.\n\nT=10, ΔT=6, y=3: is it occupied? At ΔT=6, for y=3, cars: [ -35 +6*6, -24+36] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other cars, so safe.\n\nThen a_9=U, y_10=4\n\nT=10, y=4, but at T=10, we are at y_10=4, after action a_9.\n\nAt turn T=10, position y_10=4.\n\nThen a_10=U, y_11=5\n\nT=11, y=5, safe.\n\na_11=U, y_12=6\n\nT=12, y=6, safe.\n\na_12=U, y_13=7\n\nT=13, y=7, safe.\n\na_13=U, y_14=8\n\nT=14, y=8, at ΔT=10, is it occupied? y=8 occupied only at ΔT=4,5, not at ΔT=10, so safe.\n\na_14=U, y_15=9\n\nT=15, y=9, reached.\n\nSo actions from a_4 to a_14, that's 11 actions, H=11.\n\nAt turn T=15, y=9.\n\nBut we can reach faster.\n\nFrom T=9, y=2, we can go up faster, but we have to go through each y.\n\nMinimum 7 steps from y=2 to y=9.\n\nBut at T=9, y=2, a_9=U, y_10=3\n\nT=10, y=3, safe as above.\n\na_10=U, y_11=4\n\n...\nup to a_14=U, y_15=8? y from 2 at T=9, after 6 actions: a_9 to a_14, at T=15, y=2 +6=8, then a_15=U, y_16=9, so turn 16.\n\nWith 7 actions from T=9.\n\nT=9 is turn 9, after a_4 to a_8, 5 actions, turn 9.\n\nThen a_9 to a_15, 7 actions, turn 16, H=12 actions? Actions a_4 to a_15 is 12 actions.\n\nIn the first sequence, with a_7=D from y=3 to y=2 at T=8, then a_8=S to y=2 at T=9, then a_9=U to y=3 at T=10, a_10=U to y=4 at T=11, ..., a_14=U to y=8 at T=15, a_15=U to y=9 at T=16.\n\nSame as above.\n\nBut at T=7, we were at y=3, we can be higher.\n\nFor example, at T=4, a_4=U, y_5=4\n\nT=5, a_5=U, y_6=5\n\nT=6, a_6=U, y_7=6\n\nT=7, y=6, safe.\n\nNow from here, we need to get to y<=2 at T=8, impossible.\n\nSo we cannot be high at T=7 if we want to be low at T=8.\n\nTherefore, to be safe at T=8, we must be at y<=2 at T=7.\n\nSimilarly for T=9.\n\nBut at T=7, if we are at y=2, we can go to y=2 at T=8 with S, or down.\n\nThen at T=8, y=2, we can go to y=2 at T=9 with S, or down.\n\nThen from T=9, go up.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, we can be at higher y at T=10, for example.\n\nBut from T=7 to T=10, 3 actions, from y=2, can go to y=5 max, but then at T=10, y=5, still need 4 more to y=9.\n\nBut let's calculate the earliest possible.\n\nSuppose we are at y=2 at T=7.\n\nThen a_7=S, y_8=2\n\nT=8, safe.\n\na_8=S, y_9=2\n\nT=9, safe.\n\na_9=U, y_10=3\n\nT=10, safe.\n\na_10=U, y_11=4\n\na_11=U, y_12=5\n\na_12=U, y_13=6\n\na_13=U, y_14=7\n\na_14=U, y_15=8\n\na_15=U, y_16=9\n\nReached at T=16.\n\n11 actions from a_4 to a_14, turn 15 y=8, a_15 to y=9 at T=16.\n\nH=12 actions for y=9 at T=16.\n\nBut we can go up faster from T=10.\n\nAt T=10, y=3, same as above.\n\nOr at T=9, instead of staying at y=2, we can go U, but to y=3, which is occupied at T=9, not possible.\n\nSo we must stay at y<=2 at T=9.\n\nTherefore, the earliest to start going up is T=10 from y=2 or 3.\n\nBut y at T=9 is <=2, so at T=10, y=3 if we go U.\n\nThen from y=3 at T=10 to y=9 at T=16, 6 actions.\n\nTurn T=10 y=3, after 6 U, T=16 y=9.\n\nBut to reach T=10 with y=3, how?\n\nFrom start, we need to be at y=3 at T=10.\n\nBut at T=4, y=3, so if we stay for 6 turns, but we have to avoid T=8 and T=9.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=4, y=3, a_4=S, y_5=3\n\nT=5, a_5=S, y_6=3\n\nT=6, a_6=S, y_7=3\n\nT=7, a_7=D, y_8=2  (to be safe at T=8)\n\nT=8, y=2, a_8=S, y_9=2\n\nT=9, y=2, a_9=U, y_10=3\n\nThen same as before.\n\nOr at T=7, from y=3, a_7=D, y_8=2\n\n etc.\n\nNo improvement.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=1 at T=7, but then at T=10 we are at lower y.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo it seems H=12 is the best with this approach.\n\nBut let's think if we can reach y=9 earlier by being on y=9 at T=10.\n\nT=10 is turn 10, from start turn 4, 6 actions, minimum to go from 3 to 9 in 6 actions, all U, but then at T=8 we are at y=7, occupied.\n\nSo impossible to reach at T=10 with all U.\n\nWith more actions, but we can reach at T=10 with y=9 only if we go up faster, but we can't, max +1 per turn.\n\nSo earliest possible to reach y=9 is at T=10 with all U, but not possible because of collision.\n\nNext is T=11 with H=7 actions, but with all U, at T=10 y=9, but to have y_10=9, from y_4=3, need 6 U actions, so at T=10 y=9.\n\nBut with all U, at T=8 y=7 occupied, so not possible.\n\nWith other actions, to reach y=9 at T=10, we must have net +6 in 6 actions, so all U.\n\nNo other way.\n\nSimilarly for T=11, to have y_11=9, from y_4=3, need net +6 in 7 actions, so for example 6 U and 1 S, or 7 U and 1 D but net less, etc.\n\nIf 6 U and 1 S, then at some point we stay, so we reach later.\n\nFor example, if we stay at some turn, then at turn 11, y=9.\n\nBut during the path, we may avoid the collision.\n\nFor example, suppose we stay at T=7 or something.\n\nLet's try to go all U but avoid being on freeway at T=8.\n\nBut at T=8, in all U, we are on y=7.\n\nSo if we can be on different y at T=8.\n\nBut with all U, we are on y=7 at T=8.\n\nIf we have a down action before, we are lower.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=4, a_4=U, y_5=4\n\nT=5, a_5=U, y_6=5\n\nT=6, a_6=U, y_7=6\n\nT=7, a_7=U, y_8=7 but occupied, not good.\n\nT=7, a_7=D, then y_8=5, but at T=8 y=5 occupied, collision.\n\na_7=S, y_8=6, occupied.\n\nSo no.\n\nStart with down.\n\nT=4, a_4=D, y_5=2\n\nT=5, a_5=U, y_6=3\n\nT=6, a_6=U, y_7=4\n\nT=7, a_7=U, y_8=5, occupied.\n\nSame.\n\nT=6, a_6=S, y_7=3\n\nT=7, a_7=D, y_8=2\n\nThen as before.\n\nI think it's impossible to reach before T=16 with the constraint.\n\nBut let's check if we can reach at T=10 with a different path.\n\nSuppose we go to y=9 at T=10.\n\nBut from y=3 to y=9 in 6 actions, must be 6 U.\n\nBut with 6 U, positions: T=4 y=3, T=5 y=4, T=6 y=5, T=7 y=6, T=8 y=7, T=9 y=8, T=10 y=9.\n\nAt T=8, y=7, ΔT=4, occupied, collision.\n\nAt T=9, y=8, ΔT=5, occupied, collision.\n\nSo both T=8 and T=9 have collision.\n\nTo avoid, we need to be not on y=7 at T=8 and not on y=8 at T=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, we are on those.\n\nIf we have a down action, for example at T=7, a_7=D, then y_8=5, but at T=8 y=5 occupied.\n\nOr at T=8, from y=7, a_8=D, but at T=8, when we are on y=7, collision happens at that turn, before action.\n\nCollision is checked at the beginning of the turn, before action.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, if on freeway, check if occupied.\n\nIf occupied, collision, game over, no action.\n\nSo we cannot take action if collision.\n\nSo for T=8, if y_8=7, collision, cannot take a_8.\n\nSimilarly for T=9.\n\nSo we must have y_8 not in 3-8, similarly y_9 not in 3-8.\n\nTherefore, for T=8 and T=9, player must be on y=0,1,2 or y=9.\n\ny=9 not possible at T=8 or T=9, so must be on y=0,1, or 2.\n\nThen, the earliest to reach y=9 is from there with 7 U actions, so at T=8+7=15 if start from y=2 at T=8, but at T=8 y=2, then after actions, at T=15 y=9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut at T=8, if y=2, then a_8 to a_14, 7 actions, T=15 y=9.\n\nH=11 actions? Actions a_4 to a_14 for turn 15.\n\nLet's count.\n\nTurn when action is taken: actions at t=4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 for 11 actions, at turn 15 y=9.\n\nSimilarly, if we start from T=9 y=2, actions a_4 to a_14, turn 15 y=9.\n\nH=11.\n\nIn the sequence I had earlier with staying, it was H=11 or 12, same.\n\nBut we can reduce by going up when possible before.\n\nFor example, at T=4 to T=6, we can go up to y=5 or 6.\n\nThen at T=7, go down to y=2, but from y=6 to y=2 in one step impossible.\n\nMax down to y=5.\n\nNot enough.\n\nSo I think H=11 is the minimum with this strategy.\n\nBut let's list the sequence.\n\nStart T=4, y=3\n\nTo have y_7 <=2, for example y_7=2.\n\nWith net change -1 in 3 actions.\n\nFor example:\n\na_4 = S  // y_5=3\n\na_5 = S  // y_6=3\n\na_6 = D  // y_7=2\n\nT=7, y=2, safe.\n\na_7 = S  // to have y_8=2\n\nT=8, y=2, safe.\n\na_8 = S  // to have y_9=2\n\nT=9, y=2, safe.\n\nNow from here, go up:\n\na_9 = U  // y_10=3\n\nT=10, ΔT=6, y=3: safe, as earlier\n\na_10 = U  // y_11=4\n\nT=11, y=4, safe (ΔT=7, only y=1 occupied at ΔT=7? y=1 occupied at ΔT=7, but y=4 not, so safe)\n\na_11 = U  // y_12=5\n\nT=12, y=5, safe\n\na_12 = U  // y_13=6\n\nT=13, y=6, safe\n\na_13 = U  // y_14=7\n\nT=14, y=7, safe (ΔT=10, not occupied)\n\na_14 = U  // y_15=8\n\nT=15, y=8, safe (ΔT=11, not occupied)\n\na_15 = U  // y_16=9\n\nT=16, y=9, reached.\n\nActions from a_4 to a_15, that's 12 actions.\n\nH=12.\n\nAt T=9, y=2, after a_9=U, at T=10 y=3.\n\nThen a_10=U, T=11 y=4\n\n...\na_14=U, T=15 y=7? y from 3 at T=10 to 7 at T=15 with 5 actions: T=10 y=3, T=11 y=4, T=12 y=5, T=13 y=6, T=14 y=7, T=15 y=8, then a_15=U, T=16 y=9.\n\nSo a_4 to a_15, 12 actions.\n\nBut at T=7, we are at y=2, we can go up earlier.\n\nAt T=7, y=2, instead of staying, we can go up, but at T=8, if we go U to y=3, occupied, not good.\n\nSo we must stay or go down at T=7 and T=8.\n\nSo we lose two turns.\n\nThen from T=9, we start from y=2.\n\nTo reach y=9 in 7 steps, turn 16.\n\nMinimum H is 12.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach in 11 actions.\n\nSuppose at turn T=10, y=9.\n\nThen from T=4 to T=10, 6 actions, net +6, so all U.\n\nBut as before, collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt T=11, y=9.\n\nThen 7 actions from T=4 to T=10, net +6, so 6 U and 1 S or 7 U and 1 D but net less, etc.\n\nIf 6 U and 1 S, then we stay at one turn, so for example, stay at T=7.\n\nT=4, a_4=U, y_5=4\n\nT=5, a_5=U, y_6=5\n\nT=6, a_6=U, y_7=6\n\nT=7, a_7=S, y_8=6  but at T=8 y=6 occupied, collision.\n\nIf stay at T=6, a_6=S, y_7=5\n\nT=7, a_7=U, y_8=6 occupied.\n\nIf stay at T=5, a_5=S, y_6=4\n\nT=6, a_6=U, y_7=5\n\nT=7, a_7=U, y_8=6 occupied.\n\nAll not good.\n\nIf we have a down action, net less, so at T=11 y<9 if not all U.\n\nFor example, 6 U and 1 D, net +5, so at T=11 y=8, then need another action to y=9 at T=12.\n\nLater.\n\nSo indeed, the minimal H is 12 with the sequence above.\n\nBut in the sequence, at T=9, we are at y=2, but we can be at y=2 earlier and go up when safe, but the occupied times are only at T=8 and T=9 for y=3-8, so after T=9, all safe except y=1 at T=11 and T=12? Let's see.\n\nΔT=7 and 8 for T=11 and 12.\n\nAt ΔT=7, y=1 occupied.\n\nAt ΔT=8, y=1 occupied.\n\nBut other y safe.\n\nSo when going up, at T=11, if we are on y=1, occupied, so avoid y=1 at T=11 and T=12.\n\nBut in our path, we are on higher y.\n\nFor example, in the sequence, at T=11, we might be on y=4 or something, not y=1.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTo save one turn, suppose at T=7, we are at y=2, a_7=U, but then y_8=3, occupied at T=8, not good.\n\nSo must not.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 at T=10 by being on y=0 or 1 at T=8 and T=9, but then from there to y=9 in one step impossible.\n\nSo I think H=12 is the best.\n\nBut let's look back at the car on freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 has a car at ΔT=2 only.\n\nAnd freeway 1 at ΔT=0,1,7,8.\n\nBut in our path, we don't go to y=1 or 2 at critical times, so fine.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=7, ΔT=3, all safe, we can be at y=8, for example.\n\nBut then at T=8, we must be low, impossible.\n\nNot.\n\nSo I think we have to accept H=12.\n\nBut let's list the sequence with minimal turns.\n\nStart at T=4, y=3.\n\nWe can go down immediately to y=2.\n\na_4 = D  // y_5=2\n\nT=5, ΔT=1, y=2: safe (only y=1 occupied)\n\na_5 = U  // y_6=3\n\nT=6, ΔT=2, y=3: safe (only y=2 occupied)\n\na_6 = U  // y_7=4\n\nT=7, ΔT=3, y=4: safe\n\nNow at T=7, y=4, but we need to be low for T=8, so we must go down, but to y=3,4,5 at T=8, all occupied.\n\nNot possible.\n\nFrom T=6, y=3, a_6=D, y_7=2\n\nT=7, y=2, safe.\n\na_7=S, y_8=2\n\nT=8, y=2, safe.\n\na_8=S, y_9=2\n\nT=9, y=2, safe.\n\na_9=U, y_10=3\n\na_10=U, y_11=4\n\na_11=U, y_12=5\n\na_12=U, y_13=6\n\na_13=U, y_14=7\n\na_14=U, y_15=8\n\na_15=U, y_16=9\n\nSo actions: a_4=D, a_5=U, a_6=D, a_7=S, a_8=S, a_9=U, a_10=U, a_11=U, a_12=U, a_13=U, a_14=U, a_15=U\n\nBut a_15 is the 12th action, at turn 16 y=9.\n\nH=12.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=6 we did a_6=D from y=3 to y=2 at T=7.\n\nBut we could have gone up at T=5 or something.\n\nFor example, T=4, a_4=U, y_5=4\n\nT=5, a_5=U, y_6=5\n\nT=6, a_6=D, y_7=4  (from 5 down to 4)\n\nT=7, y=4, then a_7 must go down to y=3, but at T=8 y=3 occupied.\n\nOr a_7=D, y_8=3, occupied.\n\nNot good.\n\nT=6, a_6=S, y_7=5\n\nSame.\n\nSo no, we need to be at y<=2 at T=7.\n\nTherefore, the sequence I have is fine.\n\nBut to make H smaller, since we must have y_8 and y_9 <=2, and then go up, the number of actions is fixed.\n\nMinimum actions: from start to reach y<=2 at T=8 with 4 actions, net change <= -1, so at least one down or stay, but net decrease.\n\nThen from T=8 to reach y=9, with y_8<=2, need at least 7 actions.\n\nSo total at least 4 + 7 = 11 actions, but with 4 actions to T=8, we are at turn 8, then 7 actions to turn 15, but the actions include a_4 to a_7 for T=8, then a_8 to a_14 for T=15, so 11 actions for turn 15.\n\nH=11 actions to reach at turn 4+11=15.\n\nIn the sequence, with 11 actions.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=4, y=3, a_4=S, y_5=3  // action1\n\na_5=S, y_6=3  //2\n\na_6=S, y_7=3  //3\n\na_7=D, y_8=2  //4, at T=8 y=2\n\nThen a_8=S, y_9=2  //5, at T=9 y=2\n\na_9=U, y_10=3  //6\n\na_10=U, y_11=4  //7\n\na_11=U, y_12=5  //8\n\na_12=U, y_13=6  //9\n\na_13=U, y_14=7  //10\n\na_14=U, y_15=8  //11\n\nAt T=15, y=8, not 9.\n\nWe need a_15=U to y_16=9.\n\nSo 12 actions.\n\nWith 11 actions, at turn 15, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 15, we need to be at y=9 at T=15.\n\nFrom y_8=2 at T=8, after 7 actions, at T=15, y=2+7=9 if all U.\n\nActions a_8 to a_14, 7 actions, from T=8 to T=15.\n\na_8 at turn 8, to a_14 at turn 14, position at turn 15.\n\ny_15 = y_8 + sum Δy from a_8 to a_14.\n\nIf all U, y_15 = 2 + 7 =9.\n\nYes.\n\nActions: a_4 to a_7 for the first 4 actions to reach T=8 y=2.\n\nThen a_8 to a_14 for 7 actions to reach T=15 y=9.\n\nTotal actions a_4 to a_14, 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn T=4: a_4=S\n\nT=5: y=3, a_5=S\n\nT=6: y=3, a_6=S\n\nT=7: y=3, a_7=D\n\nT=8: y=2, a_8=U? No, at T=8, we need to set a_8 for y_9.\n\nIn the actions, a_8 is chosen at T=8 for y_9.\n\nBut in the sequence above, with a_8=U, then y_9=3, but at T=9, y=3 occupied, collision.\n\nMistake.\n\nIn this case, at T=8, y=2, we cannot go U to y=3 at T=9 because occupied.\n\nWe must go S or D to keep y_9<=2.\n\nFor example, a_8=S, then y_9=2\n\nThen a_9=U, y_10=3\n\netc.\n\nBut with a_8=S, y_9=2 at T=9.\n\nThen a_9=U, y_10=3\n\n...\nup to a_14=U, y_15=8\n\nThen a_15=U, y_16=9.\n\nSo still need 12 actions.\n\nTo reach at T=15, we need y_15=9.\n\nFrom y_8=2 at T=8, to y_15=9 at T=15, with 7 actions, net +7, so all U, but then y_9=3 at T=9, occupied, collision.\n\nSo impossible to have all U from T=8.\n\nTherefore, we must have y_9<=2, so we cannot start going up until T=10.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 12.\n\nI think we should go with that.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn t1=4: a_4 = S\n\nTurn 5: a_5 = S\n\nTurn 6: a_6 = S\n\nTurn 7: a_7 = D\n\nTurn 8: a_8 = S\n\nTurn 9: a_9 = S  // to stay at y=2 for T=9\n\nThen Turn 10: a_10 = U\n\nTurn 11: a_11 = U\n\nTurn 12: a_12 = U\n\nTurn 13: a_13 = U\n\nTurn 14: a_14 = U\n\nTurn 15: a_15 = U  // y_16=9\n\nBut a_15 is the 12th action.\n\nAt Turn 9, a_9, we can go U directly, but not, because y_10=3 at T=10, but at T=9 we are at y=2.\n\na_9 at Turn 9, determines y_10.\n\nIf a_9=U, y_10=3 at T=10.\n\nBut at T=9, we set a_9, but position at T=9 is y=2.\n\nThen a_9=U, y_10=3.\n\nNo collision at T=9 for y_10.\n\nCollision only at the current turn.\n\nAt T=9, y=2, safe.\n\nThen a_9=U, then at T=10, y=3, which is safe at ΔT=6.\n\nSo we can go up at T=9.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAfter a_7=D at Turn 7, y_8=2 at T=8.\n\na_8=S at Turn 8, y_9=2 at T=9.\n\nThen at T=9, y=2, safe.\n\na_9=U at Turn 9, y_10=3 at T=10.\n\nT=10, y=3, safe.\n\na_10=U, y_11=4\n\na_11=U, y_12=5\n\na_12=U, y_13=6\n\na_13=U, y_14=7\n\na_14=U, y_15=8\n\na_15=U, y_16=9\n\nReached at T=16 with 12 actions.\n\nBut at T=9, we can do a_9=U directly, so y_10=3 at T=10.\n\nThen to reach y=9 at T=15, we need y_15=9.\n\nFrom y_10=3 at T=10, after 5 actions, at T=15, y=3+5=8, not 9.\n\nNeed 6 actions to y=9 at T=16.\n\nSo same.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let's accept that.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output the action sequence.\n\nH=12 actions.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: S  (stay at y=2 for T=9? a_8=S, y_9=2)\n\nAt Turn 8, a_8 determines y_9.\n\nPosition at T=8 is y=2.\n\nThen a_8=S, so y_9=2.\n\nTurn 9: a_9=U, y_10=3\n\nTurn 10: U, y_11=4\n\nTurn 11: U, y_12=5\n\nTurn 12: U, y_13=6\n\nTurn 13: U, y_14=7\n\nTurn 14: U, y_15=8\n\nTurn 15: U, y_16=9\n\nSo actions from Turn 4 to Turn 15.\n\nIn the sequence, for Turn 9, a_9=U, etc.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut we can reduce one action by going up at Turn 8.\n\nAt Turn 8, y=2, if we do a_8=U, then y_9=3 at T=9, but T=9 y=3 occupied, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo must not.\n\nTherefore, this is the way.\n\nSo the minimal number of turns H is 12.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t_1: S   (t1=4)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: S\n\nTurn t_1 +2: S\n\nTurn t_1 +3: D\n\nTurn t_1 +4: S\n\nTurn t_1 +5: U\n\nTurn t_1 +6: U\n\nTurn t_1 +7: U\n\nTurn t_1 +8: U\n\nTurn t_1 +9: U\n\nTurn t_1 +10: U\n\nTurn t_1 +11: U\n\nIn terms of t, t1=4.\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: S  (this is a_{t1+4} for t1+4=8)\n\nTurn 9: U  (t1+5)\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U  (t1+11=15)\n\nAnd at turn 16, y=9.\n\nH=12 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at Turn 8: S, then Turn 9: U.\n\nWe can have Turn 8: D to y=1 at T=9, but then y=1 at T=9, which is safe, then go up from there, but y lower, takes more actions to reach y=9.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo this is fine.\n\nI think this is the best.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) with the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), the player must avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). The critical observation is that all freeways from \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are occupied at turns \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 9\\) (corresponding to \\(\\Delta T = T - 4 = 4\\) and \\(\\Delta T = 5\\)), meaning the player must not be on any of these freeways at these turns. To avoid collision, the player must be at \\(y \\leq 2\\) or \\(y = 9\\) at turns 8 and 9. Since \\(y = 9\\) is unreachable by turn 9, the player must be at \\(y \\leq 2\\) at these turns.\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 12, achieved with the following sequence of actions:\n- Stay at \\(y = 3\\) for turns 4, 5, and 6 to avoid unnecessary movement during safe periods.\n- Move down to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 7 to prepare for the critical turns.\n- Stay at \\(y = 2\\) for turns 8 and 9 to avoid collisions.\n- Move up consistently from turn 10 onwards to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 16.\n\nThe sequence ensures no collisions:\n- At turn 4 (\\(\\Delta T = 0\\)): \\(y = 3\\), not occupied (safe).\n- At turn 5 (\\(\\Delta T = 1\\)): \\(y = 3\\), not occupied (only \\(y = 1\\) occupied).\n- At turn 6 (\\(\\Delta T = 2\\)): \\(y = 3\\), not occupied (only \\(y = 2\\) occupied).\n- At turn 7 (\\(\\Delta T = 3\\)): \\(y = 2\\), no freeway occupied (safe).\n- At turn 8 (\\(\\Delta T = 4\\)): \\(y = 2\\), not occupied (safe, only \\(y = 3\\) to \\(8\\) occupied).\n- At turn 9 (\\(\\Delta T = 5\\)): \\(y = 2\\), not occupied (safe, only \\(y = 3\\) to \\(8\\) occupied).\n- From turn 10 (\\(\\Delta T = 6\\)) onwards, all positions are safe during the ascent to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe action sequence for turns \\(t_1 + t\\) from \\(t = 0\\) to \\(t = 11\\) (12 actions) is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: S \\\\\nTurn 5: S \\\\\nTurn 6: S \\\\\nTurn 7: D \\\\\nTurn 8: S \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 6, and the player is at (0,4). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that exact turn.\n\nNote: The player updates position at the same time as the cars move. The player's action at turn t affects their position at turn t+1. Specifically, at turn t, the player is at y_t, and after choosing an action, they move to y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, where delta is +1 (U), -1 (D), or 0 (S). Then, at the next turn, they are at that new position.\n\nCrucial point: At turn T, the player is at position y_T. They choose an action a_T which will move them to y_{T+1} for the next turn. Therefore, when we check for collision at turn T, we only care about the freeway y_T (the row they are currently on at turn T) and whether there is a car on that freeway that has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nAlso note: The grid is only 10 rows (y=0 to y=9). We start at (0,4) and need to get to (0,9). We can only move up, down, or stay. But since we start at 4 and need to go to 9, we must move up at least 5 times. However, we have to avoid the freeways (rows 1 to 8) when there is a car that has a span covering 0 at the turn we are on that row.\n\nThe car update: \nFor a car that is left-moving (d = left) or right-moving (d = right). But note: the problem defines:\n- Left-moving: span at time t1 is [h, tau] and at time T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n- Right-moving: span at time t1 is [tau, h] and at time T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nWait, the problem says for right-moving: at t1 the span is [tau, h]? That seems inconsistent because usually we write [min, max]. Actually, note that in the right-moving case, the head is at h and tail at tau, and since it's moving right, the head is the front so h > tau. So the span is [tau, h]. Then at time T, it becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: head is at h and tail at tau, but since moving left, head is at a higher x than the tail? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: span(t1)=[h, tau] -> then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. This implies that h > tau? Because if we move left, we subtract. But the problem writes [h, tau] and then h - s*(T-t1) and tau - s*(T-t1). So if h is the head and we are moving left, then the head is at a higher x than the tail? Actually, the problem says: for left-moving, the head is at h and tail at tau. Then the span is [h, tau]? That would be backwards because typically we write [min, max]. \n\nBut note: the problem says for left-moving: \"head is at h, tail is at tau\", and then the span is [h, tau]. This might be a mistake? Because if the car is moving left, the head (front) would be at a higher x than the tail? Then if we write [h, tau] and h > tau, then it would be [h, tau] meaning from x=h to x=tau? But that would be backwards. Alternatively, if the car is moving left, then the head is at the leftmost? Actually, the problem doesn't specify the coordinate system. But note the collision condition: we care about the x=0 position.\n\nHowever, the problem states the car state as (head, tail, direction, speed). And then gives the update. We have to use the update as given.\n\nLooking at the car state for freeway 1 at t1=6:\nFreeway 1: three cars: \n1. (-30, -41, right, 6)\n2. (48, 37, right, 6) -> note: 48>37, so head=48, tail=37? Then the span at t1 is [37,48]? But the problem says for right-moving: the span is [tau, h] = [37,48]. Then at time T, it becomes [37 + 6*(T-6), 48 + 6*(T-6)].\n\nSimilarly, the first car: head=-30, tail=-41 -> so for right-moving: span at t1 is [tau, h] = [-41, -30]. Then at T: [-41 + 6*(T-6), -30 + 6*(T-6)].\n\nBut wait, the third car on freeway 1: (12, 1, right, 6) -> span at t1: [1,12]. Then at T: [1+6*(T-6), 12+6*(T-6)].\n\nNow, for left-moving, we don't have any in this state? All are right-moving? Actually, the problem only gives right-moving cars? Because all directions are \"right\". So we don't have left-moving.\n\nBut note freeway 1 has three cars, and the others have two each. And all are right-moving.\n\nSo we only need to handle right-moving cars. The update for a car on freeway k at time T (relative to t1=6) is:\n   span(T) = [tau + s*(T-6), h + s*(T-6)]\n\nCollision at turn T on freeway k: if the player is on row k at turn T (so y_T = k) and there exists a car on that freeway such that 0 is in the span of that car at time T, i.e., \n   tau + s*(T-6) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-6)\n\nBut note: for a right-moving car, the span at time T is [tau + s*(T-6), h + s*(T-6)] and since the car is moving right, the head is at the right end, so the span is increasing. Also, note that the tail is the left end and head the right end? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: at t1 the span is [tau, h] meaning from tau to h (so tau <= h). Then when we add s*(T-6), the entire interval shifts right.\n\nSo the condition for collision is: \n   tau + s*(T-6) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-6)\n\nBut note: we must check for every car on the freeway the player is on at turn T.\n\nOur plan:\nWe are at turn 6 at y=4. We need to get to y=9. The minimal number of moves without any obstacles would be 5 moves up (so 5 turns: from turn6 to turn10, because at turn6 we are at y4, then turn7: y5, turn8: y6, turn9: y7, turn10: y8, turn11: y9 -> then at turn11 we are at y9? Actually, we start at turn6: y=4. Then:\n\nTurn6: choose action a6 -> then at turn7: y7 = y6 + delta = 4 + delta.\nWe want to be at y=9 at some turn T. The minimal T is turn6+5: \n  turn6: at 4\n  turn7: 5 (if U)\n  turn8: 6\n  turn9: 7\n  turn10: 8\n  turn11: 9\n\nSo minimal H would be 5? But we have to avoid collisions on rows 5,6,7,8 (since we will be on these rows at turns 7,8,9,10). Also, we are on row4 at turn6? But row4 is freeway? Actually, freeways are rows 1 to 8. Row0 and row9 are safe? The problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". So row0 and row9 have no cars? So we are safe at row0 and row9.\n\nAt turn6: we are at row4 (which is a freeway) -> so we must check row4 at turn6 for collision? But note: the problem says \"car state\" for freeway 1 to 8. However, the car state for freeway4 is given: two cars: (-12, -23, right, 6) and (36,25,right,6). But wait: the second car has head=36 and tail=25? Then for right-moving, the span at t1=6 is [25,36]. Then at turn6 (T=6): \n   car1: [-23 + 6*(6-6), -12 + 6*(0)] = [-23, -12] -> 0 is not in [-23,-12]\n   car2: [25 + 0, 36+0] = [25,36] -> 0 not in [25,36]\n\nSo at turn6, we are safe on row4.\n\nNow, we plan to move up 5 times. But we must check the rows we are going to be on at each turn.\n\nWe are going to be:\n  Turn6: at row4 (safe as above)\n  Turn7: at row5 (if we move up) -> check freeway5 at turn7\n  Turn8: at row6 -> check freeway6 at turn8\n  Turn9: at row7 -> check freeway7 at turn9\n  Turn10: at row8 -> check freeway8 at turn10\n  Turn11: at row9 (safe)\n\nSo we need to check the freeways 5,6,7,8 at turns 7,8,9,10.\n\nBut note: we might have to wait (stay) or even move down to avoid a collision? But we want minimal turns, so we want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nLet's check each freeway at the required turn.\n\nFirst, note: t1=6, so at a future turn T, we compute the car positions as: [tau + s*(T-6), h + s*(T-6)] for each car on that freeway.\n\nFreeway5 (which we will be on at turn7, T=7):\n  Cars: same as freeway4? Actually, the table:\n      Freeway5: (-12, -23, right, 6) and (36,25,right,6) -> but wait, the table says for freeway5 the same as freeway4? And similarly for 3,4,5,6,7,8? \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n| 1 | (-30,-41,right,6), (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6) |\n| 2 | (24,-11,right,36) |\n| 3 | (-12,-23,right,6), (36,25,right,6) |\n| 4 | (-12,-23,right,6), (36,25,right,6) |\n| 5 | (-12,-23,right,6), (36,25,right,6) |\n| 6 | (-12,-23,right,6), (36,25,right,6) |\n| 7 | (-12,-23,right,6), (36,25,right,6) |\n| 8 | (-12,-23,right,6), (36,25,right,6) |\n\nSo freeways 3 to 8 have identical cars? Then we can compute for one and use for all.\n\nBut note: freeway1 and freeway2 are different.\n\nNow, we are going to be on freeway5 at turn7 (T=7). So for freeway5:\n\nCar1: (-12, -23, right, 6) -> this is (head, tail) = (-12, -23). For right-moving, the span at t1=6 is [tau, h] = [-23, -12]. Then at T=7: \n   [-23 + 6*(7-6), -12 + 6*(1)] = [-23+6, -12+6] = [-17, -6] -> 0 is not in this interval.\n\nCar2: (36,25,right,6) -> wait, the problem says (head, tail). For right-moving, the span at t1=6 is [tail, head] = [25,36]. Then at T=7:\n   [25 + 6*(1), 36 + 6*(1)] = [31,42] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway5 at turn7 is safe.\n\nFreeway6 at turn8 (T=8):\nCar1: [-23 + 6*(8-6), -12 + 6*2] = [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> note: 0 is included? \n   Condition: -11 <= 0 <= 0 -> yes, 0 is in the interval. So collision!\n\nSo at turn8, if we are on freeway6, we collide with car1.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on freeway6 at turn8.\n\nWhat to do? We can try to change our path. We are at:\n  turn6: y=4\n  turn7: y=5 (if we go up)\n  turn8: we planned y=6 -> but that causes collision.\n\nOptions:\n1. At turn7, instead of staying on course, we can do something else? But we are at y=5 at turn7. Then at turn8 we can:\n   - Move up: to y=6 -> collision\n   - Move down: to y=4 -> but then we are going backwards and we have to come back, which increases H.\n   - Stay: y=5 -> then at turn8 we are on freeway5. Then we can check freeway5 at turn8.\n\nCheck freeway5 at turn8 (T=8):\nCar1: [-23 + 6*(8-6), -12+12] = [-23+12, 0] = [-11,0] -> again 0 is in? \n   Condition: -11<=0<=0 -> yes. So freeway5 at turn8 is also unsafe? \n\nBut wait, we are at freeway5 at turn8? So we would collide? \n\nAlternatively, if we stay at turn7: we are at y=5 at turn7 and then at turn8 we stay at y=5. Then we are on freeway5 at turn8 -> and we just saw that freeway5 at turn8 has car1: [-11,0] -> so 0 is included -> collision.\n\nSo staying at turn7 (so at turn8 we are still at y=5) is also unsafe.\n\nWhat about moving down at turn7? Then at turn7 we are at y=4? How? At turn6 we are at y=4. Then if we choose D at turn6, then at turn7 we are at y=3? But we are moving down? Then we are at freeway3? But we are trying to go up.\n\nAlternatively, at turn6 we are at y=4. We could choose to not move up at turn6? \n\nLet me reorganize:\n\nWe are at turn6: y=4.\n\nWe want to avoid being on freeway6 at turn8 because that causes collision. Also, we cannot stay on freeway5 at turn8 because that also causes collision? Actually, we haven't checked freeway5 at turn8 for the same car? But note: the car on freeway5 is the same as on freeway6? But they are different freeways. The car state for freeway5 is independent of freeway6? Actually, the cars are on specific freeways. So freeway5 has its own set of cars, and freeway6 has its own set (though they are identical in this case).\n\nSo freeway5 at turn8: \n   Car1: [-23, -12] at t1=6 -> at T=8: [-23+6*2, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in. So freeway5 at turn8 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6 at turn8: same car configuration -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeway5 and freeway6 at turn8.\n\nWhat about freeway4 at turn8? We are at turn6: y=4. If we do not move at turn6 (so a6=S) then at turn7 we are still at y=4. Then at turn7, if we move up, then at turn8 we are at y=5 -> freeway5 at turn8 -> unsafe.\n\nAt turn6: if we move down? Then at turn7 we are at y=3 (freeway3). Then at turn7 we can move up to y=4 at turn8? Then we are at freeway4 at turn8.\n\nCheck freeway4 at turn8 (T=8):\nCar1: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> unsafe? So freeway4 at turn8 is also unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3 at turn8: same -> unsafe.\n\nSo all freeways 3,4,5,6 at turn8 are unsafe? Because they all have the same car configuration? \n\nBut freeway2? It has a different car. Let's check freeway2.\n\nFreeway2: only one car: (24, -11, right, 36) -> this is (head, tail) = (24, -11). For right-moving, span at t1=6 is [tau, head] = [-11,24]. Then at T=8: \n   [-11 + 36*(8-6), 24 + 36*2] = [-11+72, 24+72] = [61,96] -> 0 not in.\n\nBut we are at freeway2? How do we get to freeway2? We start at y=4 (freeway4). We can move down: \n  turn6: a6 = D -> then at turn7: y=3 (freeway3)\n  turn7: a7 = D -> then at turn8: y=2 (freeway2)\n\nSo at turn8, we are on freeway2, which is safe? \n\nThen we can continue: \n  turn8: at y=2 -> then we can start moving up.\n\nBut we need to get to y=9. This will take more turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid the unsafe freeways at turn8 by being at a safe freeway at turn8. The safe freeways at turn8:\n\nWe have:\n  freeway1: let's check at T=8.\n      Cars: \n        car1: (-30,-41,right,6) -> at t1: [-41, -30] -> at T=8: [-41+12, -30+12] = [-29, -18] -> 0 not in.\n        car2: (48,37,right,6) -> at t1: [37,48] -> at T=8: [37+12,48+12]=[49,60] -> 0 not in.\n        car3: (12,1,right,6) -> at t1: [1,12] -> at T=8: [1+12,12+12]=[13,24] -> 0 not in.\n      So freeway1 is safe at turn8.\n\n  freeway2: as above, safe at turn8.\n\n  freeway3 to 8: unsafe at turn8? Because we saw freeway3 at turn8: car1: [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\nSo safe freeways at turn8: only freeway1 and freeway2.\n\nTherefore, at turn8 we must be on freeway1 (y=1) or freeway2 (y=2).\n\nNow, we are at turn6 at y=4. How to get to y=1 or y=2 by turn8? \n\nTurn6: y=4 -> we have two moves: turn6 and turn7.\n\nWe need to go down: \n  Option1: \n      turn6: D -> y=3 at turn7\n      turn7: D -> y=2 at turn8  -> this gets to freeway2 at turn8 (safe)\n\n  Option2:\n      turn6: D -> y=3 at turn7\n      turn7: D again -> y=2 at turn8? But then we are at y=2. Alternatively, we could do two downs: \n        turn6: D -> y=3\n        turn7: D -> y=2 -> that's option1.\n\n  How to get to y=1? \n        turn6: D -> y=3\n        turn7: D -> y=2\n        turn8: D -> y=1 at turn9 -> but that's too late because we need to be at y=1 or y=2 at turn8, not turn9.\n\nSo we can get to y=2 at turn8.\n\nThen at turn8 we are at y=2 (freeway2). Then we need to get to y=9. We are at turn8 at y=2. We need to go up 7 steps: \n  turn8: U -> y=3 at turn9\n  turn9: U -> y=4 at turn10\n  turn10: U -> y=5 at turn11\n  turn11: U -> y=6 at turn12\n  turn12: U -> y=7 at turn13\n  turn13: U -> y=8 at turn14\n  turn14: U -> y=9 at turn15\n\nThat would be 9 turns (from turn6 to turn14, so H=9? But we started at turn6 and we are going to turn15? Actually, we start at turn6 and the sequence of actions from turn6 to turn14 (9 actions) to get to y9 at turn15? But the problem says we start at turn6 and we do actions for t from 0 to H-1, meaning we do H actions and then at the next turn we are at the goal? Actually, the goal is reached at turn t1 + H - 1? \n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then at the end of this sequence we should be at (0,9). The turn after the last action is t1+H. But note:\n\n  At turn t1 (turn6) we start at (0,4). Then we choose a_{t1} (a6). Then at turn7 we are at a new y. Then we choose a_{t1+1} (a7) ... until we have done H actions. Then the last action is at turn t1+H-1. And then at the next turn (turn t1+H) we are at the position. But the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" and then it says \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nSo we are to be at (0,9) at the turn t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, the state at turn t1+H-1 is (0,9). And we have applied H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSo if we start at turn6 (t1=6) and we want to be at y9 at turn T, then T = 6 + H - 1.\n\nIn the naive plan: we wanted to be at turn11 (6+5) at y9 -> then H=5: actions at turns 6,7,8,9,10 -> and at turn10+1? Actually, wait: \n  Turn6: action a6 -> then at turn7: y7\n  ...\n  Turn10: action a10 -> then at turn11: y11.\n\nBut we require y_{t1+H-1} = y_{6+H-1} = 9.\n\nSo if we do H actions, the last action is at turn 6+H-1, and then we are at y_{6+H}? \n\nNo, the update is: \n   y_{t+1} = y_t + a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, and we do a_t, then we are at y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, to be at y=9 at turn T, we must have T = 6+H? Because:\n   turn6: y6=4\n   ... \n   after H actions, we are at turn6+H, and we have y_{6+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to have y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nLet me read: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nSo at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nBut by the update, at turn t1+H-1, we are at position y_{t1+H-1}. How did we get there? We did an action at turn t1+H-2 that moved us to y_{t1+H-1}? \n\nActually, we start at turn t1: y_{t1}=4. Then we do an action a_{t1} (at turn t1) and then at turn t1+1 we are at y_{t1+1}. \n\nSo the state y_t is the state at the beginning of turn t? And then we choose an action a_t and then we move to y_{t+1} at the beginning of turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1, that means we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we don't need to do an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1: that is H actions. The last action is at turn t1+H-1. Then after that action, we are at y_{t1+H}? \n\nBut the problem says we require y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nThis seems inconsistent. \n\nLooking back: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9? Then we don't need to do an action at that turn? But the sequence includes actions from t1 to t1+H-1. That means we are doing an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut if we are already at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and we do an action, then we might move away? \n\nAlternatively, the state at the beginning of turn t is y_t, and then we do an action a_t which moves us to y_{t+1}. Therefore, we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 if and only if we arrived there at the end of the previous turn? \n\nWait, the update rule: \n   y_{t+1} = y_t + delta(a_t)\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t and then we move to y_{t+1} at the beginning of turn t+1.\n\nSo if we want to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn T, we require that the action at turn T-1 moved us to y_T=9.\n\nTherefore, the condition y_{t1+H-1}=9 means that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. And we did an action at turn t1+H-2 that moved us to 9? \n\nBut the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1: that is H actions. The last action is at turn t1+H-1. Then after that action, we are at y_{t1+H}. \n\nSo if we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we have not yet done the action at that turn. Then we do an action at turn t1+H-1 and then move to y_{t1+H} which might not be 9.\n\nThis is confusing. \n\nLooking at the problem statement: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nThis implies that the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then we are at y_{t1+H}? But we require y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. The problem likely means that after H actions (from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1), we have reached y=9 at the turn following the last action? That is, at turn t1+H we are at y=9? \n\nBut the problem explicitly says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nAlternatively, the state y_t is defined at the end of turn t? But the update rule says y_{t+1} = ... so it seems at the beginning.\n\nRe-examining: \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\" and then we are given the action a_t at time t. So at time t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1}. \n\nTherefore, y_t is the state at the start of turn t? \n\nSo at the start of turn t1 (which is 6), we are at y6=4. Then we do an action a6, and then at the start of turn7, we are at y7.\n\nWe want at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9. \n\nSo the sequence of actions we take are at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? Because the last action that affects our position is at turn t1+H-2: that action moves us to y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence is from t=0 to H-1: that is a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}. \n\nSo we are taking an action at turn t1+H-1? Then that action would move us to y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut we require y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nSo how can we be at y=9 at the start of turn t1+H-1 and then we do an action? That might move us away.\n\nUnless we do a stay action? Then we remain at 9. \n\nSo the minimal H: we want to be at y9 at the earliest turn. The earliest turn we can be at y9 is turn11 (as discussed: 4->5->6->7->8->9: 5 moves, so from turn6 we do 5 actions: turns6,7,8,9,10 -> then at the start of turn11 we are at y11=9. So then H-1 = 11-6 = 5 -> H=6? \n\nBut the sequence would be 6 actions? \n\nWe start at turn6: y6=4. We do an action at turn6: a6 -> then y7 = 4+? \nWe do actions at turn6,7,8,9,10: that is 5 actions. Then at the start of turn11, we are at y11=9. \n\nSo the turn we are at y9 is turn11. And 11 = 6 + H - 1? \n   => 6 + H - 1 = 11 -> H-1 = 5 -> H=6.\n\nBut we only did 5 actions. \n\nThe problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: so H actions. \n\nBut we need only 5 actions to go from 4 to 9? \n\nThe problem says: \"sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning:\n   t=0: a_{t1} = a6\n   t=1: a7\n   ...\n   t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd then after these H actions, we are at y_{t1+H} = 9? \n\nBut the problem says \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nPerhaps the indexing is off. \n\nAnother possibility: the state y_t is the state after the action at turn t-1? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + ...\", so y_t is the state at the beginning of turn t, and then we apply a_t to get to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn T, we must have arrived there by the action at turn T-1.\n\nTherefore, if we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn T, then T = t1 + H - 1? \n\nAnd the actions we took are from turn t1 to turn T-1 = t1+H-2? \n\nBut the problem says the sequence is up to a_{t1+H-1}. \n\nThis suggests that the last action is at turn t1+H-1, which would then move us to y_{t1+H}. \n\nSo then we would require y_{t1+H}=9. \n\nBut the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nGiven the confusion, let me assume that the problem means: after H actions, we are at y=9 at the turn following the last action. That is, at turn t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H}=9. \n\nThen the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1 (H actions), and then at turn t1+H, we are at y=9.\n\nBut then the condition should be y_{t1+H}=9. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then immediately after that action (at the same turn?) we are at y=9? But the update rule says it happens at the next turn.\n\nGiven the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", and also the update rule, it seems there is a misalignment. \n\nLooking at the answer format: it says \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\" and then the next turns until turn t1+H-1. \n\nAnd then after the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we are at the next turn (t1+H) at y=9? \n\nBut then the condition should be y_{t1+H}=9, not y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nI think there might be a typo in the problem. In many games, the state is updated after the action, and the turn counter advances. \n\nBut note the collision rule: \"collision occurs at turn T only if ... for any car on freeway y_T\". This implies that at turn T, the player is at y_T. \n\nAnd y_T is the position at the beginning of turn T.\n\nTherefore, to avoid collision, we care about y_T at turn T.\n\nAnd we require that at turn t1+H-1, the player is at y=9.\n\nSo if we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then during turn t1+H-1, we might do an action, but that action might move us away, but the goal is to be at y=9 at the beginning of that turn. \n\nAnd then we are done? So we don't necessarily have to do an action at turn t1+H-1? But the sequence requires H actions, including one at turn t1+H-1.\n\nUnless we do a stay action at turn t1+H-1 to remain at 9.\n\nSo in the plan where we arrive at turn11 at y9, we would then do an action at turn11? But we are already at y9 at turn11, so we would do a stay action.\n\nThen H=6: actions at turns6,7,8,9,10,11. Then at the beginning of turn11, we are at y11=9. Then we do a stay action at turn11, and then at turn12 we are still at y12=9. But the requirement is to be at y_{t1+H-1}=y_{6+6-1}=y11=9. So it satisfies.\n\nTherefore, in the naive plan, we would do:\n  turn6: U -> y7=5\n  turn7: U -> y8=6\n  turn8: U -> y9=7  -> but we saw that at turn8 we would be on freeway6 and it is unsafe.\n\nSo we need an alternate route.\n\nWe are at turn6: y=4.\nWe want to be at turn8: at either y=1 or y=2.\n\nTo get from y=4 to y=2 in two moves (actions at turn6 and turn7):\n  turn6: D -> y7 = 3\n  turn7: D -> y8 = 2\n\nThen at turn8, we are at y=2, which is freeway2 and safe.\n\nThen from turn8 onwards, we want to go up to 9.\n\nWe need to go from 2 to 9: that requires 7 moves up. But we have to avoid collisions on the freeways.\n\nWe are at turn8: y=2.\nThen:\n  turn8: U -> y9=3 at turn9\n  turn9: U -> y10=4 at turn10\n  turn10: U -> y11=5 at turn11\n  turn11: U -> y12=6 at turn12\n  turn12: U -> y13=7 at turn13\n  turn13: U -> y14=8 at turn14\n  turn14: U -> y15=9 at turn15\n\nBut we require to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1 = 6+H-1.\n\nWe are at y=9 at turn15, so 6+H-1 = 15 -> H=10.\n\nBut is this safe? We have to check each freeway at the turn we are on it.\n\nWe know turn8 (y=2) is safe.\n\nNow, turn9: y=3 (freeway3). Check freeway3 at turn9 (T=9, relative to t1=6, so T-6=3):\n\nFreeway3: two cars: \n  car1: (head=-12, tail=-23, right,6) -> span at T=9: [ -23 + 6*3, -12 + 18] = [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6] -> does this include 0? -5<=0<=6 -> yes! So collision at turn9 on freeway3.\n\nOh no! So we cannot be on freeway3 at turn9.\n\nWe must avoid freeway3 at turn9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4,5,6,7,8 at turn9 will be the same? Actually, freeway3 at turn9: car1: [-5,6] includes 0.\n\nSo we cannot be on any of these freeways at turn9? But freeway1 and freeway2 might be safe.\n\nCheck freeway1 at turn9 (T=9):\n  car1: (-30,-41,right,6) -> [-41+6*3, -30+18] = [-41+18, -30+18] = [-23, -12] -> 0 not in.\n  car2: (48,37,right,6) -> [37+18,48+18]=[55,66] -> 0 not in.\n  car3: (12,1,right,6) -> [1+18,12+18]=[19,30] -> 0 not in.\n  so freeway1 is safe at turn9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2 at turn9 (T=9):\n  car: (24,-11,right,36) -> [-11+36*3, 24+108] = [-11+108, 24+108] = [97,132] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo freeways 1 and 2 are safe at turn9.\n\nTherefore, at turn9 we want to be on freeway1 or freeway2.\n\nWe are at turn8: y=2 (freeway2). \n  If we stay at turn8: then at turn9 we are still at y=2 -> safe.\n  If we move up: then at turn9 we are at y=3 -> unsafe.\n  If we move down: then at turn9 we are at y=1 -> freeway1, which is safe.\n\nSo we can choose either to stay or move down.\n\nBut our goal is to go up, so moving down is not helpful. However, we can move down to freeway1 and then come back up.\n\nBut if we stay at turn8: then at turn9 we are at y=2. Then we can move up to y=3 at turn10. But freeway3 at turn10 might be safe? \n\nCheck freeway3 at turn10 (T=10, T-6=4):\n  car1: [-23+6*4, -12+24] = [-23+24, 12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in? It does not include 0? [1,12] does not include 0.\n  car2: [25+24, 36+24] = [49,60] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway3 at turn10 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4 at turn10: car1: [ -23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo if we do:\n\n  turn8: at y=2, action S (stay) -> then turn9: y=2 (safe because freeway2 at turn9 is safe)\n  turn9: U -> then at turn10: y=3 (freeway3 at turn10: safe)\n  turn10: U -> y=4 at turn11\n  turn11: U -> y=5 at turn12\n  turn12: U -> y=6 at turn13\n  turn13: U -> y=7 at turn14\n  turn14: U -> y=8 at turn15\n  turn15: U -> y=9 at turn16\n\nThen at turn16 we are at y=9. Then we require y_{6+H-1}=9 -> 6+H-1=16 -> H=11.\n\nBut can we do better? \n\nAlternatively, at turn8: move down to y=1 (freeway1) at turn9.\n  turn8: D -> then at turn9: y=1 (freeway1, safe)\n  turn9: U -> then at turn10: y=2 (freeway2)\n  turn10: U -> y=3 (freeway3) -> and we know freeway3 at turn10 is safe.\n  then continue as above.\n\nThis also takes the same number of turns.\n\nBut is there a faster way? \n\nWe are at turn8: y=2.\nWe want to get to y=9 as fast as possible. The direct route is 7 moves up, taking 7 actions (turns8 to turn14), arriving at turn15 at y=9.\n\nBut with the above, we are taking from turn8 to turn15: 8 actions? \n  actions at turn8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 -> 8 actions, and then at turn16 we are at y=9.\n\nBut we only need to move up 7 times. However, we had to stay at turn8 or move down to avoid freeway3 at turn9.\n\nBut if we move up from y=2 at turn8 to y=3 at turn9, we get collision at turn9 on freeway3.\n\nSo we cannot move up at turn8.\n\nTherefore, we must either stay or move down at turn8.\n\nThen at turn9, if we are at y=2, we can move up to y=3 at turn10 (which is safe).\n\nSo the earliest we can be at y=9 is turn16.\n\nBut let's count the turns:\n\n  turn6: start at y=4.\n  turn6: D -> to y=3\n  turn7: D -> to y=2\n  turn8: S or D (if D, then to y=1) or U (not allowed) -> we choose S: y=2\n  turn9: U -> y=3\n  turn10: U -> y=4\n  turn11: U -> y=5\n  turn12: U -> y=6\n  turn13: U -> y=7\n  turn14: U -> y=8\n  turn15: U -> y=9\n\nThen at turn15, we are at y=9. So we require y_{6+H-1}=9 -> 6+H-1=15 -> H=10.\n\nThe actions are from turn6 to turn15: that's 10 actions? \n  turns: 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 -> 10 actions.\n\nBut at turn15 we are at y=9, and we did an action at turn15? What action? The last action (at turn15) is U, which moves us from y8 at turn15 to y9 at turn16? \n\nNo, by the update: \n   at the beginning of turn15, we are at y15. We do action a15, then we move to y16 = y15 + delta.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn15? Then we would do an action at turn15 that might move us away.\n\nBut in the above plan, at the beginning of turn15, we are at y15=8. Then we do U, and then at turn16 we are at y16=9.\n\nSo then we are at y16=9, which is turn16. Then 6+H-1=16 -> H=11.\n\nBut the actions are from turn6 to turn15: 10 actions. So H=10. Then we require y_{6+10-1}=y15=9? But in this plan, y15=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y15=9, we must be at y=9 at the beginning of turn15. That means we arrived there at the end of turn14. \n\nSo we need to be at y=9 at turn15.\n\nIn the above plan, we are at y=8 at turn15. \n\nHow to be at y=9 at turn15? We would have to have moved to y9 at turn15, meaning we were at y8 at turn14 and did U at turn14.\n\nSo let's adjust the plan to arrive at turn15 at y=9.\n\nWe need to be at y=8 at turn14. Then do U at turn14, and then at turn15 we are at y=9.\n\nSo the entire plan:\n\n  turn6: D -> from y4 to y3 at turn7\n  turn7: D -> from y3 to y2 at turn8\n  turn8: S -> stay at y2 at turn9\n  turn9: U -> to y3 at turn10\n  turn10: U -> to y4 at turn11\n  turn11: U -> to y5 at turn12\n  turn12: U -> to y6 at turn13\n  turn13: U -> to y7 at turn14\n  turn14: U -> to y8 at turn15? \n      But we want to be at y8 at turn14? \n\nWe want at turn14 to be at y8 so that we can do U at turn14 to get to y9 at turn15.\n\nBut in the above, at turn14 we are at y7? Because:\n  turn13: U -> at turn14 we are at y7+1 = y8? \n\nLet me write the states explicitly:\n\n  turn6: start y6=4.\n  a6=D: y7 = 4-1 = 3.\n  a7=D: y8 = 3-1 = 2.\n  a8=S: y9 = 2.\n  a9=U: y10 = 2+1=3.\n  a10=U: y11=3+1=4.\n  a11=U: y12=4+1=5.\n  a12=U: y13=5+1=6.\n  a13=U: y14=6+1=7.\n  a14=U: y15=7+1=8.\n\nSo at turn15, we are at y15=8.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn15. We are at 8.\n\nSo we need one more move: \n  a15=U: y16=9.\n\nTherefore, to be at y16=9, we need to do an action at turn15.\n\nThen the turn we are at y9 is turn16. And 6+H-1=16 -> H=11.\n\nAnd the actions are from turn6 to turn15 (10 actions) -> wait, 10 actions? But H=11.\n\nThe sequence is for t=0 to H-1, so H actions. Here, we have 10 actions: turns6 to 15 is 10 turns? \n  turns: 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 -> that's 10 actions.\n\nThen H=10. But then we require y_{6+10-1}=y15=9, but in this plan y15=8.\n\nAlternatively, if we do 11 actions: then we would do an extra action at turn16? But we are already at y16=9 at the beginning of turn16, so we can do a stay action at turn16 to remain at 9.\n\nThen the plan would be:\n\n  a6: D\n  a7: D\n  a8: S\n  a9: U\n  a10: U\n  a11: U\n  a12: U\n  a13: U\n  a14: U  -> this gets us to y15=8 at the beginning of turn15.\n  a15: U  -> then at turn16 we are at y16=9.\n  a16: S  -> to stay at turn16, then at turn17 we are still at 9.\n\nBut we require to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1 = 6+H-1.\n\nIf we do 11 actions (H=11), then we require y_{6+11-1}=y16=9. And in this plan, at the beginning of turn16, we are at y16=9. Then we do a16=S, and then at turn17 we are at y17=9, but that's later.\n\nBut the condition is only that at the beginning of turn16 we are at 9. So it is satisfied.\n\nSo the actions are for turns6 to turn16 (11 actions).\n\nBut is there a shorter way? \n\nCan we avoid the extra moves? \n\nWe are at turn8: y=2.\nWe could move up on a later turn when it is safe.\n\nBut we saw that at turn9, freeway3 is unsafe, but at turn10 it is safe.\n\nSo the earliest we can move up to freeway3 is turn9 action for turn10 arrival.\n\nWe might try to be at freeway1 at turn9 by moving down at turn8, and then move up more quickly? \n\nAt turn8: we are at y=2. If we move down (a8=D), then at turn9 we are at y=1 (freeway1, safe).\nThen at turn9: we move up to y=2 at turn10 (freeway2, safe) -> but then we are at the same as if we had stayed.\nAt turn10: move up to y=3 (freeway3, safe) -> same as before.\n\nSo it takes the same number of moves.\n\nAlternatively, can we be at y=9 sooner by using a different route? For example, we could move down to freeway1 and then move up very fast, but we are still constrained by the freeway safety.\n\nLet me try to see if we can move up faster on freeways that are safe at the required turns.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn16 (for H=11) or sooner.\n\nThe minimal number of up moves is 7 (from y=2 to y=9). And we have to do them in sequence. We also have to do two down moves initially (from 4 to 2) and then possibly extra stays or down moves. So the total moves are at least 7 up + 2 down = 9 moves. With 9 moves, we would be at turn6+9 = turn15. But then at turn15, we would be at y=9? \n\nLet's simulate with 9 moves:\n\n  turn6: D (y7=3)\n  turn7: D (y8=2)\n  turn8: U (y9=3) -> unsafe at turn9: freeway3 at turn9 is unsafe.\n  so we cannot.\n\n  turn6: D (y7=3)\n  turn7: D (y8=2)\n  turn8: S (y9=2)\n  turn9: U (y10=3)\n  turn10: U (y11=4)\n  turn11: U (y12=5)\n  turn12: U (y13=6)\n  turn13: U (y14=7)\n  turn14: U (y15=8) -> then we need one more U to get to 9.\n\nSo we need 10 moves: \n  turns6 to turn15: 10 actions, and then at turn16 we are at y=9.\n\nThen we require one more action (stay) at turn16 to have y16=9 at the beginning of turn16, and then we do a stay to remain.\n\nSo total actions: 11.\n\nWe can try to see if there is a turn where we can move up twice in a row without being caught.\n\nFor example, after turn9, we are at y=2. Then we can move up on turn9 and turn10 to get to y=4 at turn11? \n  turn9: U -> y10=3 (freeway3 at turn10: safe)\n  turn10: U -> y11=4 (freeway4 at turn11: T=11, T-6=5 -> car1: [-23+30, -12+30] = [7,18] -> 0 not in. car2: [25+30,36+30]=[55,66] -> safe.\n  turn11: U -> y12=5 (freeway5 at turn12: T=12, T-6=6: car1: [-23+36, -12+36]=[13,24] -> safe.\n  turn12: U -> y13=6 (freeway6 at turn13: T=13, T-6=7: car1: [-23+42, -12+42]=[19,30] -> safe.\n  turn13: U -> y14=7 (freeway7 at turn14: T=14, T-6=8: car1: [-23+48, -12+48]=[25,36] -> safe.\n  turn14: U -> y15=8 (freeway8 at turn15: T=15, T-6=9: car1: [-23+54, -12+54]=[31,42] -> safe.\n  turn15: U -> y16=9.\n\nSo then we have:\n\n  turn6: D\n  turn7: D\n  turn8: S  (y9=2)\n  turn9: U  (y10=3)\n  turn10: U (y11=4)\n  turn11: U (y12=5)\n  turn12: U (y13=6)\n  turn13: U (y14=7)\n  turn14: U (y15=8)\n  turn15: U (y16=9)\n\nThen at turn16, we are at y=9. We did 10 actions. Then to be at y=9 at turn16, which is turn6+10-1? 6+10-1=15, but turn16 is 16. \n\nWe require y_{6+H-1}=9. Here, we are at y16=9 at the beginning of turn16. So we need 6+H-1=16 -> H=11.\n\nTherefore, we must do an action at turn16: we can do S to stay.\n\nSo the full plan has 11 actions.\n\nThe actions are:\n\n  a6 = D\n  a7 = D\n  a8 = S\n  a9 = U\n  a10 = U\n  a11 = U\n  a12 = U\n  a13 = U\n  a14 = U\n  a15 = U\n  a16 = S   [because at turn16 we are at y=9 and we must do an action? and then we remain]\n\nBut note, the sequence is for turns6 to turn16 (11 actions), and then at the beginning of turn17 we are at y17=9, but we require to be at y=9 at turn16 (the beginning of turn16) -> but in this plan, at the beginning of turn16, we are at y16=9. Then we do a16=S, and then at turn17 we are still at 9. But the condition is only for turn16.\n\nSo it is satisfied.\n\nBut wait, the requirement is y_{t1+H-1}=9. For H=11, that is y_{6+11-1}=y16=9. And we are at y16=9 at the beginning of turn16, before doing action a16. Then we do a16=S, which is fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nBut is there a faster way? For example, can we avoid the initial two down moves by a different path? \n\nSuppose we try to go up immediately but avoid the collision at turn8 on freeway6 by being on a safe freeway at turn8 without going down to y=2.\n\nWe saw that at turn8, only freeway1 and freeway2 are safe. \n\nFrom y=4 at turn6, can we be at freeway1 or freeway2 at turn8 with only two moves? \n  To get to freeway1 (y=1) in two moves: \n      turn6: D -> y7=3\n      turn7: D -> y8=2 (freeway2) -> then we are at y=2, not y=1.\n  To get to y=1: we would need three moves: \n      turn6: D -> y7=3\n      turn7: D -> y8=2\n      turn8: D -> y9=1\n\nBut then at turn9 we are at y=1, and then we can start moving up. \n\nBut this takes three moves to get to y=1 at turn9. Then we need to go up to 9: 8 moves (y1->y2->...->y9). \n  turn9: y=1\n  turn9: U -> y10=2\n  turn10: U -> y11=3\n  ... \n  turn16: U -> y17=9\n\nThen we are at y17=9 at turn17. Then 6+H-1=17 -> H=12, which is worse.\n\nAlternatively, at turn6: D to y=3\n turn7: D to y=2\n turn8: D to y=1 (then at turn8 we are at y=1, which is safe) \n turn9: U to y=2 (safe) \n turn10: U to y=3 (safe, as at turn10 freeway3 is safe)\n and then continue as before.\n\nThis would be:\n  a6=D\n  a7=D\n  a8=D\n  a9=U\n  a10=U\n  ... up to a16=U (then y17=9) -> then we need a17=S? \n  actions from turn6 to turn17: 12 actions, H=12.\n\nWorse than 11.\n\nSo the plan with 11 actions is better.\n\nNow, in the plan with 11 actions, we have:\n\n  turn6: D\n  turn7: D\n  turn8: S\n  turn9: U\n  turn10: U\n  turn11: U\n  turn12: U\n  turn13: U\n  turn14: U\n  turn15: U\n  turn16: S\n\nBut wait, after a15=U at turn15, we are at y16=9. Then a16=S at turn16: and then at turn17 we are at y17=9. But we only require to be at y16=9. The action at turn16 is not necessary for reaching the goal, but the sequence requires H actions and we have to provide exactly H actions.\n\nSince we are already at y16=9 at the beginning of turn16, we could in theory not do an action? But the sequence must have H actions. \n\nAccording to the problem, we must provide a sequence of exactly H actions, and after those actions, we should be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, after 11 actions (at turns6 to turn16), the last action is at turn16. Then the state at turn t1+H-1 = 6+11-1 = 16 is y16=9. And indeed, at the beginning of turn16, before any action, we are at y16=9. \n\nBut the action at turn16 is then taken, and it might change the state, but the condition is only on the state at the beginning of turn16.\n\nSo it is satisfied.\n\nBut note: the action at turn16 is not necessary. However, the problem requires a sequence of H actions. So we can choose any action for turn16, but it won't affect the state at turn16 (which is already 9) but will affect turn17. Since the condition is only for turn16, we can choose S.\n\nSo the plan is valid.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, we must output the actions for turns6 to turn16.\n\nBut the current turn is t1=6, and we are to output from turn6 to turn6+H-1 = 6+10=16? \n  H=11, so turns from 6 to 6+11-1 = 16.\n\nSo 11 actions.\n\nThe actions are:\n  turn6: D\n  turn7: D\n  turn8: S\n  turn9: U\n  turn10: U\n  turn11: U\n  turn12: U\n  turn13: U\n  turn14: U\n  turn15: U\n  turn16: S\n\nBut let's verify the collision at each turn:\n\n  turn6: y6=4 -> freeway4: at T=6: safe (as initially)\n  turn7: y7=3 (after a6=D) -> freeway3 at T=7: \n        car1: [-23+6*(1), -12+6] = [-17,-6] -> safe.\n        car2: [25+6,36+6]=[31,42] -> safe.\n  turn8: y8=2 (after a7=D) -> freeway2 at T=8: \n        car: [-11+36*2, 24+72] = [61,96] -> safe.\n  turn9: y9=2 (after a8=S) -> freeway2 at T=9: \n        car: [-11+36*3, 24+108] = [97,132] -> safe.\n  turn10: y10=3 (after a9=U) -> freeway3 at T=10:\n        car1: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n        car2: [25+24,36+24]=[49,60] -> safe.\n  turn11: y11=4 -> freeway4 at T=11:\n        car1: [-23+30, -12+30]=[7,18] -> safe.\n        car2: [25+30,36+30]=[55,66] -> safe.\n  turn12: y12=5 -> freeway5 at T=12:\n        car1: [-23+36, -12+36]=[13,24] -> safe.\n        car2: [25+36,36+36]=[61,72] -> safe.\n  turn13: y13=6 -> freeway6 at T=13:\n        car1: [-23+42, -12+42]=[19,30] -> safe.\n        car2: [25+42,36+42]=[67,78] -> safe.\n  turn14: y14=7 -> freeway7 at T=14:\n        car1: [-23+48, -12+48]=[25,36] -> safe.\n        car2: [25+48,36+48]=[73,84] -> safe.\n  turn15: y15=8 -> freeway8 at T=15:\n        car1: [-23+54, -12+54]=[31,42] -> safe.\n        car2: [25+54,36+54]=[79,90] -> safe.\n  turn16: y16=9 -> no freeway, safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nTurn 6: D\nTurn 7: D\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: S\n\nBut wait, at turn16 we are at y=9, and we do S. But the problem does not require us to be at 9 for multiple turns, only at turn16. So this is acceptable.\n\nIs there a way with H=10? \n\nIf H=10, then we require to be at y_{6+10-1}=y15=9 at the beginning of turn15.\n\nSo we must be at y=9 at turn15.\n\nTo get from y=4 at turn6 to y=9 at turn15, that is 9 turns later. The net move is +5. But we have to avoid the cars.\n\nWe must be at y=9 at turn15.\n\nWe know that at turn8, we must be at y=1 or y=2 to avoid the collision on freeways3-8.\n\nFrom turn6 to turn8 (two actions): \n   to get to y=1 or y=2, we need to go down: \n        either to y=2 (as before) or to y=1 (which takes three actions, but we only have two).\n\nSo we can only get to y=2 at turn8.\n\nThen from turn8 (y=2) to turn15 (7 turns later), we need to move up 7 times. \n\nThat requires 7 up actions. But we have only 7 actions from turn8 to turn14: \n   turn8: action -> to y at turn9\n   turn9: action -> to y at turn10\n   ...\n   turn14: action -> to y at turn15.\n\nSo we need to do 7 up actions in a row: \n   turn8: U -> y9=3\n   turn9: U -> y10=4\n   turn10: U -> y11=5\n   turn11: U -> y12=6\n   turn12: U -> y13=7\n   turn13: U -> y14=8\n   turn14: U -> y15=9\n\nBut then at turn9: y=3 -> freeway3 at turn9: car1: [-5,6] -> 0 in, collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot do U at turn8.\n\nWe could do at turn8: S or D. \n  If S: then turn9: y=2.\n  Then we need to move up 7 times in 6 actions (from turn9 to turn14)? That is impossible because we can only move one per action.\n\nTherefore, there is no way to achieve y15=9 with only 10 actions.\n\nHence, the minimal H is 11.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: D\nTurn 7: D\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: S\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on. So we start with Turn 6.\n\nWe have 11 actions: turns 6 to 16.\n\nThis matches.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn 6 while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11. The sequence of actions ensures that the player moves safely by avoiding freeways when cars occupy the x=0 position at the corresponding turns. The actions are as follows:\n\n- At turn 6, move down (D) to avoid future collisions and position for safe movement.\n- At turn 7, move down (D) to reach freeway 2 by turn 8, which is safe.\n- At turn 8, stay (S) to remain on freeway 2, avoiding unsafe freeways at this turn.\n- From turns 9 to 15, move up (U) consecutively to navigate through the freeways safely, as the car positions do not collide with x=0 at the respective turns.\n- At turn 16, stay (S) to maintain position at y=9, satisfying the goal at turn 16 (since \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 6 + 11 - 1 = 16\\)).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ S}\n}",

The current turn is t1 = 7, and I'm at y=3.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. All cars are moving right, according to the data. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)], where t1 is the current time, which is 7.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving, it says: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the table, for freeway 1, it has (head h, tail τ, direction, speed). For example, freeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 6). Since it's right-moving, head should be greater than tail, I think? -24 is greater than -35, yes, since -24 > -35. Similarly, (54,43,right,6), 54>43? 54>43 is true, but typically for right-moving, if it's moving right, head might be the front, so if it's moving right, head should be on the right, so if coordinates increase to the right, head should be larger. But here, for (54,43), if head is 54 and tail is 43, that means the car is from 43 to 54, and since it's moving right, at time t1=7, position x=43 to x=54.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, [τ, h] where τ is tail, h is head, so τ ≤ h. Similarly for left-moving, but here all are right-moving.\n\nIn the collision rule, collision occurs if 0 is in Span(T) for the freeway y_T. That means at turn T, when I am at y-coordinate y_T, if there is a car on that freeway whose span includes x=0 at that time, I collide.\n\nAlso, note that at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and I decide an action to go to y_{T+1}. But when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, so I check collision for freeway y_T at time T. If I move to a different freeway, at turn T I am not on the new freeway yet, so I don't check it until turn T+1 if I stay or something.\n\nThe note says: if at turn T I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, I am not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at time T, even if 0 is in their span at T, because I'm not there yet.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, for the freeway I am on, y_T, 0 is in Span(T) for some car on that freeway.\n\nNow, the player position is at x=0 always, I think, since it's (0, y_t), so only y changes, x is fixed at 0.\n\nSo I need to be at y=9 at some turn, without colliding on the way.\n\nStart at turn 7, y=3.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny from 0 to 9, so to go from 3 to 9, I need to increase by 6. But I can move up, down, or stay, so minimum turns would be 6 if I can go directly up, but I have to avoid cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since no cars mentioned, and y=9 is the goal.\n\nThe cars are only on y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be fine, no collision possible there.\n\nBut at the goal, I need to be at (0,9), which is y=9, so no car there.\n\nNow, at each turn, when I am on a freeway, I need that at that time, no car on that freeway has 0 in its span.\n\nLet me denote the current time as t = 7.\n\nFor each freeway k, and for each car on it, I need the span at time T, relative to t=7.\n\nSince t1=7, let τ = T - 7, so τ is the number of turns after t=7.\n\nAt time T = 7 + τ, the span for a car with initial head h, tail τ_init, speed s, direction right.\n\nInitial span at t=7: for right-moving, [τ_init, h]? In the table, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for right-moving, head h and tail τ, with h > τ.\n\nSo at t=7, span is [τ, h].\n\nThen at time T = 7 + τ, span is [τ + s * τ, h + s * τ], where τ is the time elapsed, but τ is used for tail, confusing.\n\nLet me use Δt for time elapsed.\n\nSet t_rel = T - t1 = T - 7.\n\nThen for a car, at time T, span = [tail + s * t_rel, head + s * t_rel] for right-moving.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, I'll assume that.\n\nNow, collision on freeway k at time T if y_T = k and 0 is in the span of some car on freeway k at time T.\n\nThat is, for some car on k, tail + s * t_rel ≤ 0 ≤ head + s * t_rel.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I have the cars.\n\nFirst, list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: three cars: (-24, -35, right, 6), (54, 43, right, 6), (18, 7, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (60, 25, right, 36) — speed 36, that's fast.\n\nFreeway 3 to 8: each has two cars: (-6, -17, right, 6) and (42, 31, right, 6) for all? Let me check.\n\nFreeway 3: (-6, -17, right, 6), (42, 31, right, 6) — 42 and 31, 42>31, yes.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 to 8 all have the same: (-6, -17, right, 6) and (42, 31, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 4,5,6,7,8 all have identical cars? But freeway 1 and 2 are different.\n\nFreeway 1 has three cars, freeway 2 has one, freeway 3 to 8 have two each, with the same parameters.\n\nBut since freeways are different, I need to consider each separately.\n\nNow, I start at y=3 at t=7.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up directly, but I have to check if I can be on each freeway without collision when I pass through.\n\nSince I move one y-level per turn if I go up, but I can stay or go down, but going down is away from goal, so probably not helpful, except to avoid collision.\n\nBut since I want minimal turns, I should avoid staying or going down unless necessary.\n\nMinimal turns: from y=3 to y=9, difference 6, so if no obstacles, H=6, actions U,U,U,U,U,U to go from 3 to 4,5,6,7,8,9 in 6 turns.\n\nBut with cars, I need to ensure that at each turn, when I am on a freeway, no car has 0 in span.\n\nNow, let's consider the sequence.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nFor T=7, y=3, I am on freeway 3 at t=7.\n\nI need to check if at t=7, on freeway 3, is 0 in any car span?\n\nFor freeway 3, cars: car1: (-6, -17, right, 6) and car2: (42, 31, right, 6)\n\nAt t=7, t_rel=0, span car1: [-17, -6], since tail -17, head -6.\n\n0 is not between -17 and -6, since -17 <= 0 <= -6? -17 <=0 is true, but 0 <= -6 is false, so 0 not in [-17,-6].\n\nCar2: [31,42], 0 not in there. So at t=7, on freeway 3, no collision. Good.\n\nNow, I need to choose action for turn 7, which will determine y for t=8.\n\nActions: U to go to y=4, D to y=2, S to stay y=3.\n\nBut y=2 is freeway 2, which might have cars.\n\nGoal is to go up, so probably U to y=4.\n\nBut let's see if I can go up directly.\n\nSuppose I go U each turn from t=7 to t=12, so y: t=7:3, t=8:4, t=9:5, t=10:6, t=11:7, t=12:8, then at t=13, I can go to y=9.\n\nt=7: y=3\n\nt=8: y=4 after action U at t=7\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position (0, y_t), then I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t, I am on freeway y_t, and I check collision for that position at time t.\n\nFor example, at turn t=7, I am at y=3, and we checked no collision.\n\nThen I choose a_7, say U, so y_8 = y_7 +1 =4.\n\nThen at turn t=8, I am at y=4, and I check collision on freeway 4 at time t=8.\n\nSimilarly for each turn.\n\nIn this case, to reach y=9, I need to be at y=9 at some turn, say at turn T, then y_T =9.\n\nSince y starts at 3, and I need to be at 9, with actions changing y by -1,0,+1, the minimal number of turns is at least 6, if I go up each time.\n\nBut I might need to stay or go down to avoid, which would increase H.\n\nSo first, try to see if direct up is possible.\n\nPath: start t=7, y=3.\n\nAction a_7: U, so y_8=4\n\nt=8, y=4, need check freeway 4 at t=8.\n\nt_rel = t - t1 = t - 7\n\nFor t=8, t_rel = 8-7=1\n\nFreeway 4: cars: (-6,-17,right,6) and (42,31,right,6)\n\nCar1: tail = -17, head = -6, speed=6\n\nAt t=8, t_rel=1, span = [tail + s*t_rel, head + s*t_rel] = [-17 + 6*1, -6 + 6*1] = [-11, 0]\n\n-17 +6 = -11, -6 +6 =0, so [ -11, 0 ]\n\nNow, 0 is in this span, since -11 <= 0 <= 0? 0 <= 0 is true, so 0 is included.\n\nIf 0 is in the span, collision occurs.\n\nAt t=8, on freeway 4, with car1 span [-11,0], which includes 0, so if I am on freeway 4 at t=8, I collide.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on freeway 4 at time t=8.\n\nIf I go directly up, at t=8 I would be on y=4 and collide.\n\nSo direct up is not possible at t=8 for freeway 4.\n\nNow, for other freeways.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=8 I need to be somewhere else or stay.\n\nBut I have to go through y=4 at some point.\n\nPerhaps at a different time.\n\nSince the cars move, the spans change over time.\n\nFor freeway 4, car1: at time T, span [ -17 + 6*(T-7), -6 + 6*(T-7) ]\n\n0 is in span when -17 +6*(T-7) <= 0 <= -6 +6*(T-7)\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nBut for freeway 4, car1: let u = T-7\n\nSpan: [-17 +6u, -6 +6u]\n\n0 in span: min <= 0 <= max, but since it's a closed interval.\n\nSo -17 +6u <= 0 and 0 <= -6 +6u\n\nFirst inequality: -17 +6u <= 0 => 6u <= 17 => u <= 17/6 ≈ 2.833\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -6 +6u => 6 <= 6u => u >=1\n\nSo for u >=1 and u <= 2.833, so u=1,2 since u integer? u = t_rel, integer turns.\n\nu=1: t=8, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nu=2: t=9, span [-17+12, -6+12] = [-5,6], 0 is between -5 and 6? -5 <=0<=6, yes.\n\nu=3: t=10, span [-17+18, -6+18] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, u=0: t=7, span [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nu=4: [7,18], etc.\n\nSo car1 on freeway 4 has collision at u=1 and u=2, i.e., t=8 and t=9.\n\nNow car2 on freeway 4: (42,31,right,6), tail=31, head=42? In the table it says (42,31,right,6), so head=42, tail=31? But for right-moving, if tail is 31, head 42, that means car from 31 to 42.\n\nSpan at u: [31 +6u, 42 +6u]\n\n0 in span: 31+6u <=0 <=42+6u\n\nBut 31+6u <=0 implies 6u <= -31, u <= -31/6 ≈ -5.166, impossible since u>=0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <=42+6u always true for u>=0, but 31+6u <=0 false, so 0 never in span for car2.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways with similar cars.\n\nFor freeway 4, only car1 can cause collision at u=1,2.\n\nNow freeway 3: similar, cars (-6,-17,right,6) and (42,31,right,6)\n\nCar1: same as above, collision when u=1,2? At u=1: span [-17+6, -6+6] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nu=2: [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nu=0: [-17,-6], 0 not.\n\nu=3: [1,12], not.\n\nCar2: no issue.\n\nBut at t=7, I am on freeway 3, u=0, no collision.\n\nIf I stay at t=7, y=3, then at t=8, still y=3, t_rel=1, on freeway 3, span car1: [-11,0], 0 included, collision.\n\nSo if I stay on freeway 3 at t=8, I collide.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 4 at t=8, as above.\n\nNow back to the path.\n\nI need to go from y=3 to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: I can go up, down, or stay at each turn.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should go up when possible, but avoid collision times.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway and each time when it is dangerous, i.e., 0 in some car span.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: cars: (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6), (18,7,right,6)\n\nCar1: tail=-35, head=-24, speed=6\n\nSpan at u: [-35 +6u, -24 +6u]\n\n0 in span: -35+6u <=0 <= -24+6u\n\nFirst: -35+6u <=0 => 6u <=35 => u <= 35/6 ≈5.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24+6u => 24 <=6u => u >=4\n\nSo u=4,5\n\nu=4: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], 0 included\n\nu=5: [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nu=6: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], not\n\nCar2: (54,43,right,6), tail=43, head=54\n\nSpan: [43+6u, 54+6u], min 43>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nCar3: (18,7,right,6), tail=7, head=18\n\nSpan: [7+6u, 18+6u]\n\n0 in: 7+6u <=0 <=18+6u\n\n7+6u <=0 false for u>=0, so never.\n\nSo freeway 1 dangerous only for car1 at u=4,5, t=11,12\n\nt=7+4=11, t=7+5=12\n\nNow freeway 2: only one car: (60,25,right,36)\n\nTail=25, head=60, speed=36\n\nSpan: [25 + 36u, 60 + 36u]\n\n0 in: 25+36u <=0 <=60+36u\n\n25+36u <=0 false, so never in span, since 25>0.\n\nSo freeway 2 is always safe? Tail=25, at u=0, [25,60], not including 0, and increasing, so yes, always safe.\n\nBut let's confirm: 25 +36u >=25>0, so 0 never <= min, so not in span.\n\nSimilarly, head+ s u >=60>0.\n\nSo freeway 2 no danger.\n\nNow freeway 3: cars (-6,-17,right,6) and (42,31,right,6)\n\nCar1: as before, dangerous u=1,2 (t=8,9)\n\nCar2: no issue.\n\nSo dangerous at u=1,2\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same cars, dangerous u=1,2 (t=8,9)\n\nFreeway 5: same, dangerous u=1,2 (t=8,9)\n\nSimilarly freeway 6,7,8 all have same cars, dangerous at u=1,2 (t=8,9)\n\nNow freeway 8 is y=8.\n\nI need to be on y=8 at some point to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is goal, no car.\n\nNow, for freeways 3 to 8, all are dangerous at t=8 and t=9, meaning if I am on any of them at t=8 or t=9, I collide with car1.\n\nAt t=8, u=1, for freeway 3 to 8, car1 span [-11,0] or similar, includes 0.\n\nSimilarly at t=9, u=2, span [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nAt other times, for example, at t=7, u=0, on freeway 3, span [-17,-6], not include 0, safe.\n\nAt t=10, u=3, span [1,12], not include 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, freeway 1 is dangerous only at t=11,12, but freeway 1 is y=1, which is low, I might not need to go there.\n\nFreeway 2 is always safe.\n\nI start at y=3, t=7.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince freeways 3 to 8 are dangerous at t=8 and t=9, I should not be on them at those times.\n\nSo I need to be on a safe freeway at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSafe freeways: y=0,1,2,9 but y=9 is goal, y=0 might be safe, but let's see.\n\ny=0: no cars, so always safe.\n\ny=1: has cars, but dangerous only at t=11,12, so at t=8,9, it should be safe? At t=8, u=1, for freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 at u=1, t=8.\n\nCars: car1 span at u=1: [-35+6, -24+6] = [-29,-18], 0 not in.\n\nCar2: [43+6,54+6]=[49,60], not.\n\nCar3: [7+6,18+6]=[13,24], not.\n\nSo at t=8, freeway 1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly at t=9, u=2, car1: [-35+12, -24+12]=[-23,-12], not include 0.\n\nCar2: [55,66], etc, all safe.\n\nOnly at u=4,5 dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 is always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nSo at t=8 and t=9, I should be on a safe freeway: y=0,1,2, or 9.\n\nBut y=9 is goal, if I can be there earlier, but I start from y=3.\n\nNow, at t=7, I am on y=3, which is safe only at t=7, not at t=8 or t=9.\n\nSo I need to move away from y=3-8 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nOptions: I can go down to y=2 or y=1 or y=0, or up, but up to y=4 is dangerous at t=8.\n\ny=4 at t=8 is dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, to y=2 or less.\n\ny=2 is freeway 2, which is always safe.\n\ny=1 safe at t=8,9.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nThen after t=9, I can go up.\n\nt=10 onwards, freeways 3-8 are safe, since u=3, span [1,12] for car1, 0 not in.\n\nNow, let's think about the sequence.\n\nStart t=7: y=3, safe. I need to choose action.\n\nIf I go up to y=4 at t=8, but y=4 at t=8 is dangerous, collision.\n\nIf I stay, y=3 at t=8, dangerous.\n\nSo I must go down or to a safe level.\n\nI can go down to y=2.\n\nAction at t=7: D, so y_8 = 3 -1 =2.\n\nThen at t=8, I am on y=2, freeway 2, which is always safe, no collision.\n\nThen at t=8, I need to choose action for t=9.\n\nNow at t=9, I need to be safe. Freeway 2 is safe, so I can stay at y=2, or go to y=1 or y=3.\n\ny=3 at t=9 is dangerous, since u=2, freeway 3 car1 span [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=1, freeway 1 at t=9 is safe, as above.\n\nOr stay y=2.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nAfter t=9, at t=10, u=3, freeways 3-8 are safe.\n\nSo I can go up from there.\n\nBut y=2 at t=9.\n\nThen from t=10, I can go up to y=3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\ny from 2 to 9, difference 7, so need at least 7 turns from t=10? Let's see.\n\nAt t=9, y=2, then I can go up each turn to y=9 at t=15? t=9 y=2, t=10 y=3, t=11 y=4, t=12 y=5, t=13 y=6, t=14 y=7, t=15 y=8, t=16 y=9? That's many turns.\n\nBut I can go faster.\n\nSince from t=10 onwards, all freeways are safe, I can go up directly.\n\nBut at t=11 and t=12, freeway 1 is dangerous, but I might not be on freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 is y=1, which is low.\n\nIn the path above, I am at y=2 at t=9.\n\nIf I go up: at t=10, y=3 (action U at t=9), safe since u=3.\n\nt=11, y=4, u=4, but for freeway 4, at u=4, t=11, car1 span: for freeway 4, car1 at u=4: [-17+24, -6+24] = [7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all freeways 3-8 safe for u>=3.\n\nFreeway 1 dangerous at u=4,5 t=11,12, but I won't be there.\n\nSo from y=2 at t=9, I can go U to y=3 at t=10, U to y=4 at t=11, ..., up to y=9.\n\ny=2 at t=9.\n\nt=9: y=2\n\nAction at t=9: U, so y_10 =3\n\nt=10: y=3, safe\n\nAction U, y_11=4\n\nt=11: y=4, safe (u=4, t=11, t_rel=11-7=4, freeway 4 car1 [ -17+24, -6+24] = [7,18], not 0)\n\nSimilarly, t=12: y=5, say, u=5, freeway 5 car1 [-17+30, -6+30]=[13,24], safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny from 3 to 9 is 6 levels, but I start from y=2 at t=9? Let's list the turns.\n\nt=7: y=3\n\nAction D: so y_8 = 2\n\nt=8: y=2, safe (freeway 2)\n\nNow at t=8, choose action for t=9.\n\nI can choose to go to y=3, but at t=9, y=3 is dangerous.\n\nGo to y=1: action D, y_9=1\n\nOr stay y=2: action S, y_9=2\n\nOr go to y=3, but dangerous.\n\ny=1 at t=9: freeway 1, at u=2, t=9, as above, safe.\n\nBut if I go to y=1, I have to come back, which takes more turns.\n\nBetter to stay at y=2 or go up if possible, but y=3 not possible at t=9.\n\nSo options: at t=8, I can:\n\n- Action S: stay at y=2 for t=9\n\n- Action D: go to y=1 for t=9\n\n- Action U: go to y=3 for t=9, but dangerous, not possible.\n\nSo only S or D.\n\nIf I stay S at t=8, then y_9=2, at t=9 on y=2, safe.\n\nThen from there, at t=9, I can go U to y=3 at t=10, etc.\n\nIf I go D at t=8, to y=1 at t=9, then at t=9 on y=1, safe, then at t=9, I need to go up to y=2 or something.\n\nBut going to y=1 might be worse, since I have to go up two more.\n\ny=1 to y=9 is 8 levels, whereas from y=2 to y=9 is 7 levels.\n\nSo better to stay at y=2.\n\nMinimal turns.\n\nAt t=8, action S: stay y=2 for t=9.\n\nThen at t=9, action U: go to y=3 for t=10.\n\nt=10: y=3, safe (u=3)\n\nThen I can go U each turn to y=9.\n\nt=10: y=3\n\nAction U: y_11=4\n\nt=11: y=4, safe\n\nAction U: y_12=5\n\nt=12: y=5, safe\n\nAction U: y_13=6\n\nt=13: y=6, safe\n\nAction U: y_14=7\n\nt=14: y=7, safe\n\nAction U: y_15=8\n\nt=15: y=8, now freeway 8, at t=15, u=15-7=8\n\nFreeway 8 car1: [-17 +6*8, -6 +6*8] = [-17+48, -6+48] = [31,42], not 0, safe.\n\nThen action U: y_16=9\n\nt=16: y=9, goal reached.\n\nBut at which turn? y=9 at t=16.\n\nStarted at t=7 y=3, reached t=16 y=9, so H=10 turns? From t=7 to t=16, that's 10 actions? Let's see the number of actions.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=7 to t=15 to reach y=9 at t=16.\n\nt=7: action D, to y=8? No.\n\nAt t=7, I take action to determine y_8.\n\nThen at t=8, take action to determine y_9, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, I reach y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nt1=7, start position at t=7.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=7 + H, y_{7+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, with above: t=7: y=3, action a_7\n\nt=8: y=8? With action D at t=7, y_8=2\n\nt=8: action S, so y_9=2\n\nt=9: action U, y_10=3\n\nt=10: y=3, action U, y_11=4\n\n...\nup to t=15: y=8, action U, y_16=9\n\nSo at turn t=16, y=9, which is after 9 actions? From t=7 to t=16, that's 9 steps? t=7 to t=8 is one action, etc.\n\nt=7: after action, y_8 set\n\nNumber of actions H such that after H actions, at turn t1 + H, y=9.\n\nt1=7, at t=7+H, y=9.\n\nIn above, at t=16, y=9, so 7+H=16, H=9.\n\nBut I started at t=7 y=3, and after 9 actions, at t=16 y=9.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=9.\n\nBut earlier I thought minimal is 6, but not possible due to danger at t=8,9.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=2 at t=8, then directly to higher y, but I have to go through the levels.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=8 and t=9, I need to be on safe freeway, like y=2.\n\nBut at t=9, I can be on y=2, then at t=10, I go to y=3, but I could go directly to y=4 or something, but I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with |Δy| <=1, so I can only move to adjacent y or stay.\n\nSo from y=2 at t=9, I can only go to y=1,2,3 at t=10.\n\nNot directly to y=4.\n\nSo must go step by step.\n\nBut from t=10 onwards, all safe, so I can go up fast.\n\nIn the above path, from t=10 y=3 to t=16 y=9, that's 6 turns to go from 3 to 9, which is minimal up moves.\n\nBut I spent t=7 to t=9 at lower y.\n\nt=7: y=3\n\nt=8: y=2 (after D)\n\nt=9: y=2 (after S)\n\nt=10: y=3 (after U at t=9)\n\nSo from t=8 to t=9, I stayed at y=2 for two turns, but I could have used one turn to go somewhere else.\n\nAt t=8, I am at y=2, instead of staying, I could go to y=1, but that would be worse.\n\nOr, can I go to y=0 or something.\n\ny=0 is safe, but lower.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAnother thought: at t=7, instead of going down, I could go up, but to y=4 at t=8 is dangerous, not possible.\n\nUnless I go to a different freeway at different time.\n\nFor example, I could stay at t=7, but staying at t=7: if action S at t=7, y_8=3, but at t=8 y=3 is dangerous, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I must leave y=3-8 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSo at t=8, I need to be on y=0,1,2.\n\nSimilarly at t=9, on y=0,1,2 or 9, but y=9 not reachable yet.\n\nNow, y=2 is safe and closer to goal.\n\nI could be on different y at t=8 and t=9.\n\nBut y=2 is fine.\n\nTo save turns, at t=9, I could be on y=3, but not possible at t=9.\n\nt=9 is dangerous for y=3-8.\n\nUnless for some freeway it is safe, but no, all y=3 to 8 have the same car setup, dangerous at u=1,2.\n\ny=1 and y=2 safe at t=8,9.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nNow, at t=7, I go to y=2.\n\nThen at t=8, I am at y=2.\n\nNow, instead of staying, I could go to y=1 at t=9, but then I have to come back.\n\nFor example: t=8 action D, y_9=1\n\nt=9: on y=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=9 action U, y_10=2\n\nt=10: y=2, then action U, y_11=3, etc.\n\nThen t=10 y=2, t=11 y=3, ..., to y=9 at t=17? Worse.\n\nSo better to stay at y=2 at t=9.\n\nIn the first plan, with t=9 y=2, then t=10 y=3, t=11 y=4, t=12 y=5, t=13 y=6, t=14 y=7, t=15 y=8, t=16 y=9.\n\nH=9 actions.\n\nBut I reach y=9 at t=16.\n\nt=7 to t=16 is 10 turns? No: turns: t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16: that's 10 positions, but actions from t=7 to t=15.\n\nDefine: at turn t, position y_t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAfter H actions, from t=7 to t=7+H, y_{7+H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n- At t=7: take action a_7, to set y_8\n\n- At t=8: take action a_8, to set y_9\n\n- ...\n\n- At t=7+H-1: take action a_{7+H-1}, to set y_{7+H} =9\n\nSo y_{t1 + H} =9 with t1=7.\n\nIn the path:\n\nSet a_7 = D, so y_8 =2\n\nThen at t=8, a_8 = S, so y_9 =2\n\nThen at t=9, a_9 = U, so y_10 =3\n\nt=10, a_10 = U, y_11=4\n\nt=11, a_11 = U, y_12=5\n\nt=12, a_12 = U, y_13=6\n\nt=13, a_13 = U, y_14=7\n\nt=14, a_14 = U, y_15=8\n\nt=15, a_15 = U, y_16=9\n\nSo at t=16, y=9, so H=9 actions, from t=7 to t=15.\n\nt=7+H =16, H=9.\n\nNow, can I do with less?\n\nFor example, at t=7, instead of going down, can I go to y=4 later when safe.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, y=4 is dangerous.\n\nSo I have to avoid being on y=3-8 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nNow, at t=10, u=3, safe for all.\n\nSo the earliest I can be on y=3 is t=10.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at t=11, etc., but I can be on y=3 at t=10, then y=4 at t=11, up to y=9 at t=16, same as above.\n\nBut I start at y=3 at t=7.\n\nI need to be at y= something else at t=8 and t=9.\n\nThe safe y at t=8 and t=9 are y=0,1,2.\n\ny=2 is the highest, so best to be at y=2.\n\nNow, from t=7 y=3, to y=2 at t=8: that takes one action down.\n\nThen at t=8 y=2, I need to be at t=9 on safe y, so y=2 is safe, so I can stay.\n\nIf I could be at y=9 earlier, but not possible.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps go to y=1 or y=0 at t=8 or t=9, but that might not help.\n\nOr, at t=7, I go down to y=2, then at t=8, instead of staying, I go down to y=1, but then at t=9 I am at y=1, then I have to go up to y=2, then to y=3, etc., which takes more turns.\n\nFor example: t=7: D to y_8=2\n\nt=8: D to y_9=1\n\nt=9: U to y_10=2\n\nt=10: U to y_11=3\n\n...\n\nthen to y=9 at t=17, worse.\n\nSo not good.\n\nStay at y=2 for both t=8 and t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, I am at y=2, but I could at t=8 go directly to a position that allows faster ascent, but since I can only move one step, I can't.\n\nUnless I go to y=2 at t=8, then at t=9, I go to y=3, but y=3 at t=9 is dangerous, not possible.\n\nSo I must be on y<=2 or y=9 at t=9.\n\ny=9 not reachable.\n\nSo I have to spend t=8 and t=9 on y=0,1,2.\n\nThe best is to be on y=2 for both turns, so that I only lose one level (from y=3 to y=2) and then go up.\n\nIn the sequence, I have y=2 at t=8 and t=9, so two turns at y=2, but that's necessary to avoid danger.\n\nThen from t=10 to t=16 to reach y=9, but t=10 y=3 to t=16 y=9, 7 turns? y=3 to y=9 is 6 moves, so from t=10 to t=16 is 6 actions? Let's list y over time.\n\nt: y\n\n7: 3\n\n8: 2  (after a_7=D)\n\n9: 2  (after a_8=S)\n\n10: 3  (after a_9=U)\n\n11: 4  (a_10=U)\n\n12: 5  (a_11=U)\n\n13: 6  (a_12=U)\n\n14: 7  (a_13=U)\n\n15: 8  (a_14=U)\n\n16: 9  (a_15=U)\n\nSo from t=10 to t=16, y from 3 to 9, 7 turns but 6 up moves? t=10 y=3, t=11 y=4, ..., t=16 y=9, that's 6 steps up in 6 actions (from a_9 to a_15?).\n\nActions: a_9 at t=9 sets y_10=3, a_10 sets y_11=4, ..., a_15 sets y_16=9.\n\nSo to go from y=3 to y=9, it takes 6 actions: U,U,U,U,U,U.\n\nBut here, I started from y=3 at t=10 to y=9 at t=16 with 6 actions.\n\nBut in the whole, from t=7, I used a_7=D to go to 2, a_8=S to stay, then a_9 to a_15: 7 actions to go from t=10 to t=16? a_9 to a_15 is 7 actions? a_9, a_10, a_11, a_12, a_13, a_14, a_15: that's 7 actions for y from 3 to 9? No.\n\ny_10=3 after a_9, then y_11=4 after a_10, ..., y_16=9 after a_15.\n\nSo actions a_9 to a_15: 7 actions for 6 up moves? y_10=3, y_11=4, y_12=5, y_13=6, y_14=7, y_15=8, y_16=9. So from y_10=3 to y_16=9, that's 6 steps: 3 to 4,4 to5,5 to6,6 to7,7 to8,8 to9, so 6 actions: a_10 to a_15? Let's index.\n\nAt time t, action a_t sets y_{t+1}.\n\nSo for y_{t+1} to be set.\n\nStart: t=7, y_7=3\n\na_7: determines y_8\n\na_8: determines y_9\n\n...\n\na_k: determines y_{k+1}\n\nWe want y_m =9 for some m.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{7+H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\na_7: D, y_8=2\n\na_8: S, y_9=2\n\na_9: U, y_10=3\n\na_10: U, y_11=4\n\na_11: U, y_12=5\n\na_12: U, y_13=6\n\na_13: U, y_14=7\n\na_14: U, y_15=8\n\na_15: U, y_16=9\n\nSo y_16=9, so m=16, t1=7, so 7+H=16, H=9.\n\nThe actions are from a_7 to a_15, 9 actions.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 16.\n\nNow, can I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=3 at t=10, but I need to get there from start.\n\nAt t=7 y=3, I have to be not on y=3-8 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSo at t=8, I must be on y=0,1,2.\n\nSimilarly t=9.\n\nThe closest safe is y=2.\n\nIf I go to y=2 at t=8, that's fine.\n\nBut at t=9, if I could be on a higher y, but no, because to be on y=3 at t=9 is dangerous.\n\nUnless for freeway 2, but y=2 is freeway 2, which is safe, but I can't jump to y=3.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at t=7, I go down to y=2, then at t=8, I go up, but to y=3 at t=9? No.\n\nAction at t=8 sets y_9.\n\nIf at t=8 I am at y=2, I can set a_8 to U, so y_9=3, but at t=9, if y_9=3, I am on freeway 3 at t=9, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nSo I cannot do that.\n\nTherefore, I must have y_9 <=2 or y_9=9, impossible.\n\nSo y_9 must be 0,1, or 2.\n\nSimilarly, y_8 must be 0,1,2.\n\nNow, since I start at y=3, to go to y=2 at t=8, I need one down action.\n\nThen to have y_9=2, I need to stay or come from below, but staying is fine.\n\nThen at t=9, I am at y=2, then I can go up to y=3 at t=10.\n\nt=10 is the earliest I can be on y=3 safely.\n\nThen from there, it takes 6 up actions to reach y=9 at t=16.\n\nThus H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach y=9 earlier by being on different path.\n\nFor example, freeway 1 has danger at t=11,12, but I might not be there.\n\nIn this path, I never go to y=1, so no issue.\n\nAt t=11, if I were on y=1, it would be dangerous, but I am on y=4 or higher, safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=4 directly at some time, but I have to go through y=3.\n\nAnother thought: at t=7, I could go down to y=2, then at t=8, go down to y=1, but then at t=9, I am at y=1, which is safe, then at t=9, I can go up to y=2 at t=10, but then y=2 at t=10, then to y=3 at t=11, etc., but t=10 y=2, t=11 y=3, ..., to y=9 at t=17, later.\n\nWorse.\n\nGo to y=0, even worse.\n\nSo best to stay at highest possible safe level, y=2.\n\nBut at t=9, I am at y=2, but I could, at t=8, after going to y=2, instead of staying, if I could go to y=3, but not possible.\n\nSo I think H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nI need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=7, action D, but let's write the actions.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} for t=7.\n\nt_1=7.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nThen at turn 8, action S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nThen U for turns 10 to 15? Turns from t=7 to t=15 for actions.\n\nList:\n\nTurn 7: a_7 = D  // to y=2\n\nTurn 8: a_8 = S  // stay y=2\n\nTurn 9: a_9 = U  // to y=3\n\nTurn 10: a_10 = U  // to y=4\n\nTurn 11: a_11 = U  // to y=5\n\nTurn 12: a_12 = U  // to y=6\n\nTurn 13: a_13 = U  // to y=7\n\nTurn 14: a_14 = U  // to y=8\n\nTurn 15: a_15 = U  // to y=9\n\nAnd y_16=9.\n\nNow, at turn 15, action U, to y=9 at turn 16.\n\nBut in the sequence, the last action is at turn 15.\n\nH=9 actions.\n\nBut is there a way to save one turn?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=8 at an earlier time when it is safe.\n\ny=8 is safe for u>=3, t>=10.\n\nSimilarly, I can reach y=8 at t=15 as above.\n\nEarliest to be on y=3 is t=10.\n\nThen y=4 at t=11, y=5 at t=12, y=6 at t=13, y=7 at t=14, y=8 at t=15, y=9 at t=16.\n\nCannot be faster.\n\nAt t=9, if I were on y=3, but not possible.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 directly, but no, only one step per turn.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 2 is always safe, and y=2, I could go to y=2 at t=8, then stay there, but I need to go up.\n\nBut at t=9, I am at y=2, then I go to y=3 at t=10.\n\nBut what if at t=8, I go to y=2, then at t=9, I go to y=3 immediately? But at t=9, y=3 is dangerous, cannot.\n\nUnless the car is not there, but it is.\n\nPerhaps for some freeway the danger is different, but all y=3-8 are same.\n\nFreeway 1 has different cars, but y=1 is safe at t=9.\n\nBut not helpful.\n\nI think H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut let's check if I can be on y=4 at t=10 or something.\n\nAt t=10, I can be on y=4 if I was on y=3 or y=5 at t=9, but t=9 I am on y<=2, so at t=10, y can be at most y=3 (from y=2 at t=9, action U).\n\nSo y=3 at t=10 is the best.\n\nSimilarly, cannot reach higher faster.\n\nThus, the sequence should be as above.\n\nIn the action list, I have a_8=S, which is stay.\n\nBut I could, at t=8, after being at y=2, do something else, but no need.\n\nTo make it with fewer stays, but here I have only one stay.\n\nIn the sequence, I have one down and one stay, then all up.\n\nBut I need to output for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nH=9, so turns 7 to 15.\n\nActions: D, S, U, U, U, U, U, U, U\n\nBut the last U is to go to y=9.\n\nNow, in the car state, for freeway 2, there is a car with speed 36, but since tail=25, it never reaches x=0, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut in the output, I need to write the sequence.\n\nBut let me confirm the freeway 2 car.\n\nFreeway 2: (60,25,right,36), tail=25, head=60, speed 36.\n\nAt any u, span [25+36u, 60+36u] >=25>0, so 0 not in, yes.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut the player position is at (0,y), and cars on freeways, but when I move, the note says: if I move to different y, I am not on the new freeway until the next turn.\n\nBut in this case, when I am at turn t, I am on y_t, and I check collision for that y at time t.\n\nIn the sequence above, all should be fine.\n\nAt t=8, y=2, freeway 2, safe.\n\nt=9, y=2, freeway 2, safe.\n\nt=10, y=3, freeway 3, u=3, span car1 [ -17+18, -6+18] = [1,12], not 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nt=11, y=4, u=4, [ -17+24, -6+24]=[7,18], safe.\n\netc.\n\nt=15, y=8, freeway 8, u=8, [ -17+48, -6+48]=[31,42], safe.\n\nThen to y=9.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=8?\n\nSuppose I reach y=9 at t=15.\n\nThen y_15=9.\n\nBut y_15=9, which requires that at t=14, y_14=8 or 9, and action to set y_15=9.\n\nIf y_14=8, action U; if y_14=9, action S or something, but goal is to reach, probably action to set it.\n\nBut minimal, probably y_14=8, action U.\n\nNow, y_14=8 at turn 14.\n\nNow, turn 14, t=14, u=14-7=7.\n\nFreeway 8 safe, as above.\n\nBut to have y_14=8, I need to be at y=8 at t=14.\n\nWhich requires that at t=13, y_13=7,8,9 and action.\n\nBut y_13=7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly, I need to be on y=3 at some point.\n\nBut the constraint is that at t=8 and t=9, I cannot be on y=3-8.\n\nt=8 and t=9 are fixed dangerous.\n\nNow, y_8 must be <=2.\n\ny_9 must be <=2.\n\nThen y_10: since y_9<=2, y_10 <=3.\n\nSimilarly, y_11 <=4, etc.\n\nNow, y_14=8.\n\ny_14=8.\n\nThe path: start y_7=3.\n\ny_8 <=2 (since must be safe at t=8)\n\ny_9 <=2 (safe at t=9)\n\nThen y_10: from y_9 <=2, can be at most 3.\n\ny_11: at most 4\n\ny_12: at most 5\n\ny_13: at most 6\n\ny_14: at most 7\n\nBut we need y_14=8, which is greater than 7, impossible.\n\ny_13 at most 6? Let's see:\n\ny_9 <=2\n\nThen y_10 = y_9 + Δ, |Δ|<=1, so y_10 <= 3\n\ny_11 <= y_10 +1 <=4\n\ny_12 <=5\n\ny_13 <=6\n\ny_14 <=7\n\nBut y_14=8 required, but y_14 <=7, contradiction.\n\nThus, impossible to have y_14=8.\n\nSimilarly, y_15=8 possible? But we need y_15=9 or something.\n\nTo have y_15=9.\n\ny_14 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_14=8, then action U to y_15=9.\n\ny_14=8.\n\nNow y_14 <=? From above, y_14 <=7? No.\n\ny_13 <=6, y_14 <= y_13 +1 <=7.\n\ny_14 <=7, but we need y_14=8, impossible.\n\nIf y_14=9, but then at t=14, y=9, which is goal, but if y_14=9, then I am at y=9 at turn 14, so I reached earlier.\n\nBut to have y_14=9, which requires y_13=8,9, or 10, but y<=9, so y_13=8 or 9.\n\nIf y_13=8, action U; if y_13=9, action S.\n\nNow, y_13 <=6 from above? y_13 <= y_12 +1 <=6? y_12 <=5, y_13 <=6.\n\ny_13 <=6, but 8 or 9 >6, impossible.\n\nThus, cannot have y_14=9 or y_14=8 for y_15=9.\n\nEarliest possible to have high y.\n\ny_9 <=2\n\ny_10 <=3\n\ny_11 <=4\n\ny_12 <=5\n\ny_13 <=6\n\ny_14 <=7\n\ny_15 <=8\n\ny_16 <=9\n\nSo y_15 <=8, so at best y_15=8, then y_16=9 with action.\n\ny_15=8 is possible, as in our sequence.\n\ny_16=9.\n\nCannot earlier.\n\nThus H=9 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is as before.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nActions from turn 7 to turn 15.\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nIn the output, it should be for turns t_1 to t_1 + H-1, which is 7 to 15.\n\nAnd actions.\n\nBut let me write in the box.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 9, I go U to y=3 at t=10.\n\nThen all U.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 1, it has three cars, but we didn't go there.\n\nFreeway 2 has the fast car, but safe.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid the stay.\n\nFor example, at t=7, go D to y=2.\n\nThen at t=8, go to y=1? But then I need to come back.\n\nFor instance: a_7=D, y_8=2\n\na_8=D, y_9=1\n\na_9=U, y_10=2\n\na_10=U, y_11=3\n\netc., but then y_11=3 at t=11, which is later than t=10, so to y=9 at t=17, worse.\n\na_7=D, y_8=2\n\na_8=U, but cannot, because y_9=3 would be at t=9, dangerous.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo must have a stay or equivalent.\n\nThus, the sequence is minimal.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) is 9. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by moving down to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 8 to avoid the dangerous time intervals at \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\) for freeways \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\), staying at \\(y = 2\\) for turn 9, and then moving up directly to \\(y = 9\\) starting from turn 10.\n\n- At turn 7, the player is at \\(y = 3\\). Freeway 3 is safe at \\(t = 7\\) (since no car spans include \\(x = 0\\) at \\(t = 7\\)).\n- Moving down to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 8 avoids the collision on freeways \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\), as freeway 2 is always safe (no car spans include \\(x = 0\\) at any time).\n- Staying at \\(y = 2\\) at turn 9 ensures safety, as freeway 2 remains safe.\n- From turn 10 onwards, freeways \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are safe (no car spans include \\(x = 0\\) for \\(t \\geq 10\\)), allowing direct upward movement to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n- Turn 7: Move down (D) to reach \\(y = 2\\) at turn 8.\n- Turn 8: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 2\\) for turn 9.\n- Turn 9: Move up (U) to reach \\(y = 3\\) at turn 10.\n- Turns 10 to 15: Move up (U) each turn to increase \\(y\\) by 1 per turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 16.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in 9 turns with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 8, and the player is at (0,2). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe car update rules: All cars in this problem are moving to the right (since direction is \"right\"). For a right-moving car, the span at time T is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] (note: the initial state gives (head, tail) and for right-moving, head is the front? But the update rule says: for right-moving: initial span is [tau, h] and becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. However, in the input, the cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). We must interpret the head and tail appropriately.\n\nLooking at the update rule for right-moving:\n  Initial: [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\nBut note the example input for freeway 1: (-18, -29, right, 6). This would be interpreted as h = -18, tau = -29? Then the initial span at t1 is [tau, h] = [-29, -18]. Then at time T, it becomes [-29 + 6*(T-8), -18 + 6*(T-8)].\n\nHowever, note that the collision condition is: at turn T, if the player is at (0, k) for freeway k, then we check if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway k at that turn? But note the note: \n  \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nSo at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T. We only check the car on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nImportant: The player moves at the same time as the cars. So at each turn, we update the player and the cars.\n\nPlan:\nWe need to simulate the possible moves (U, D, S) from the current state and avoid positions that would cause a collision.\n\nWe are starting at turn t1=8, at y=2.\n\nWe want to reach y=9. Note that the grid has y from 0 to 9. We start at 2 and need to get to 9. The minimal moves without any obstacles would be 7 moves of U (if we could go up 7 times without any car hitting). But we have to avoid cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nHowever, note that freeway 0 and freeway 9 are not present? The problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". So y=0 and y=9 are safe? But note the goal is (0,9). We are at (0,2) and we have to get to (0,9). So we must pass through the freeways 3,4,...,8? Actually, we are at y=2 and we need to go to y=9: so we must go through y=3,4,5,6,7,8 and then to 9.\n\nBut note: when we are at y=2 at turn T, then we are on freeway 2? Actually, the freeway index is the same as the y-coordinate? The problem says: \"freeways y=1,...,8\". So when the player is at (0, k) for k in {1,...,8}, then we are on freeway k and we must check the cars on that freeway.\n\nHowever, at y=0 and y=9, there are no freeways? So we are safe? The problem doesn't mention cars on y=0 or y=9. So we can be at y=0 or y=9 without worrying about cars.\n\nBut note the goal is (0,9). So we need to be at (0,9) at the last turn. We can plan to go through the freeways 3 to 8 and then to 9.\n\nBut note: the move from y=8 to y=9: at the turn when we are at y=8, we are on freeway 8. Then we move U to y=9. At the next turn, we are at y=9 and that's the goal. And at the turn when we are at y=8, we must avoid the car on freeway 8. Then when we move to y=9, we are not on any freeway (since freeways are 1-8) so we are safe.\n\nSimilarly, we start at y=2: at the current turn t1=8, we are at y=2. We are on freeway 2? But wait, the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". So we must check freeway 2 at turn 8? \n\nAt turn 8, we are at (0,2) and we are on freeway 2. So we must check if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway 2 at turn 8.\n\nLet's check the cars on freeway 2: \n  Only one car: (-48, -83, right, 36)\nAt turn 8 (current turn), the car is at: \n  Since it's right-moving: initial span at t1=8: [tau, h] = [-83, -48]? But the input is given as (head, tail) and the update rule uses [tau, h] for right. However, note the input says: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, ...)\" so we have h=-48, tau=-83. Then the span is [tau, h] = [-83, -48]. \n\nAt turn 8, we are at x=0. Is 0 in [-83, -48]? No, because -48 is negative. So we are safe at turn 8.\n\nNow, we need to plan the next moves.\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over the state: (turn, y) and the turn count. We want the minimal H.\n\nBut note: the state space is continuous in the car positions? Actually, the car positions are determined by the time. So at a given time T, the car positions on each freeway are fixed. Therefore, we can precompute for each freeway and for each future turn T (>=8) the set of x-coordinates that are occupied by cars on that freeway at time T. However, note that the collision condition is only at x=0? The problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\".\n\nSo we only care about whether at time T, on freeway k, there is a car that covers x=0.\n\nTherefore, for a given freeway k and time T, we can compute if there is a car that has a span that includes 0.\n\nWe note that the cars are moving at constant speed. For a right-moving car with initial head h, tail tau at time t1=8, at time T, the head becomes h + s*(T-8) and the tail becomes tau + s*(T-8). The span is [tau + s*(T-8), h + s*(T-8)] (for right-moving, and note that since it's moving right, the tail is the left end and head is the right end? Actually, the update rule says: for right-moving: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. And the initial span at t1 is [tau, h]. So at time T, the span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nWe need to check if 0 is in [A, B] where A = tau + s*(T-8), B = h + s*(T-8). That is, if A <= 0 <= B.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving cars, but in this problem, all are right-moving.\n\nSo for each freeway k and time T (>=8), we can check each car on freeway k and see if 0 is in the span.\n\nWe note that T is an integer (turns), so we can compute for each T and each freeway k (1 to 8) whether x=0 is occupied.\n\nBut note: the player can only be at one freeway at a time. So we only need to check the freeway k where the player is at time T.\n\nSteps for simulation:\n\nWe are going to simulate from T=8 onwards. The state is (T, y) and we record the action sequence that leads to that state without collision. We want to reach y=9 with minimal T (i.e., minimal H, the number of turns from T=8).\n\nBut note: the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn T. We are at T=8 at (0,2). We are going to simulate until we get to (0,9). The number of turns H is the number of actions taken, so from T=8 to T=8+H-1, we take H actions and at turn T=8+H-1 we are at (0,9). So we start at T=8, and after H-1 actions we are at T=8+H-1.\n\nAlternatively, we can let the state be (time, y) and time starts at 8. We do actions at time 8, 9, ... until we get to y=9.\n\nWe'll do BFS by time (since time increases by 1 each step) and y in [0,9].\n\nWe have three actions: U, D, S.\n\nThe next state: \n  If we choose U: y_next = y + 1 (if y<9, else 9? but the problem says y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, and clamped to [0,9]. But note: if we are at y=9 and choose U, we stay at 9? However, we are starting at 2 and going to 9, so we don't need to go beyond 9. So we can assume that if y=9 and we choose U, we remain at 9. But we are done when we first get to 9? The problem says: \"reach (0,9)\". So once we are at 9, we can stop.\n\nBut note: we might be at 9 earlier than expected? Actually, we start at 2 and we need to go up 7 steps. However, we can also go down? But going down would be counterproductive. So we should only consider U and S? But sometimes we might have to wait (S) to avoid a car.\n\nSo the actions: U, D, S. But D might be used to avoid a car? For example, if we are at y=3 and at the next turn the freeway y=4 is dangerous, but we can go down to y=2? But then we are moving away from the goal. However, in some cases it might be necessary? But let's see: we are at y=2 and we want to go to y=9. The minimal path without obstacles is 7 steps of U. But if we go down, we are increasing the steps. So unless we have to avoid a car by going down and then up, which might be more than 7, we should avoid going down. However, we must consider all possibilities.\n\nBut note: the problem says minimal number of turns. So we are looking for the shortest path. Therefore, we should consider states that we have not visited at an earlier time? Actually, if we visit the same y at a later time, it might be worse? But sometimes we might have to wait and then go up, which could be the same total time? However, if we can avoid a car by waiting (S) at the same y for one turn, that might be acceptable. But going down and then up would cost 2 extra moves and might not be beneficial.\n\nSo we can restrict the moves to only U and S? And avoid D? But the problem does not forbid D. However, since the goal is above, and we are starting at 2, going down would only be useful if we are forced to avoid a car and then go up, and that might be the only way? But let's see the car patterns.\n\nAlternatively, we can design a path that goes only upward and sometimes stays.\n\nWe are going to precompute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each time T (>=8) whether there is a car covering x=0 at time T.\n\nWe'll create a 2D array: safe[k][T] for k in 1..8 and T in 8,9,... up to a limit. What limit? The minimal steps without obstacles is 7, but we might need to wait. Let's assume we might wait up to, say, 20 turns? We can set a limit to 20 or 30.\n\nBut note: the cars are moving. We can compute for each car the times when it covers 0.\n\nFor a car (h, tau, d, s) on freeway k (and d='right'), the condition for 0 to be covered at time T:\n  tau + s*(T-8) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-8)\n\nWe can solve for T:\n\n  tau + s*(T-8) <= 0  => T-8 >= ceil(-tau/s)   [if s>0] but note: tau is negative? Actually, tau and h are given.\n\nBut note: we have multiple cars per freeway. We must check all cars.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: three cars: \n  car1: h=-18, tau=-29, s=6\n  car2: h=60, tau=49, s=6   -> but wait, the input says (head, tail) and then direction and speed. For car2: head=60, tail=49? Then the initial span at T=8 is [49,60]. Then at time T, [49+6*(T-8), 60+6*(T-8)]. Since 49 and 60 are positive and increasing, they will never cover 0? Because 49+6*(T-8) is at least 49 at T=8, which is >0. So car2 and car3 (h=24, tau=13, s=6) -> [13,24] at T=8, which is positive? So they are to the right and moving right. So they will never cover 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: one car: h=-48, tau=-83, s=36. \n  Condition: -83 + 36*(T-8) <= 0 <= -48 + 36*(T-8)\n\nSolve:\n  Lower bound: -83 + 36*(T-8) <= 0  => 36*(T-8) <= 83 => T-8 <= 83/36 ~ 2.305 => T-8 <= 2 (since integer) -> T<=10\n  Upper bound: 0 <= -48 + 36*(T-8) => 36*(T-8) >= 48 => T-8>=48/36=4/3~1.333 => T-8>=2 -> T>=10\n\nSo we need T-8>=2 and T-8<=2? That is T=10? Let me check:\n  At T=10: \n    lower = -83 + 36*(2) = -83+72 = -11\n    upper = -48 + 72 = 24\n    So 0 is in [-11,24] -> yes.\n\n  At T=9: \n    lower = -83+36= -47\n    upper = -48+36 = -12 -> 0 not in [-47,-12]? because -12<0 -> no.\n  At T=11: \n    lower = -83+36*3 = -83+108=25 -> 0 not in [25, ...] -> no.\n\nSo freeway 2 is unsafe only at T=10.\n\nFreeway 3: two cars:\n  car1: h=0, tau=-11, s=6 -> initial at T=8: [-11,0] -> at T=8, 0 is included? \n        at T=8: [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> unsafe at T=8? But we are at freeway 2 at T=8, not freeway 3. So we don't care for now.\n\n  But we will need to check when we are on freeway 3.\n\n  For car1: \n      Condition: -11+6*(T-8) <= 0 <= 0+6*(T-8)\n      Lower: -11+6*(T-8)<=0 -> 6*(T-8)<=11 -> T-8<=1.833 -> T<=9 (if T-8=1: 6<=11 -> true; T-8=2: 12>11 -> false for lower? But we have two conditions: both must hold.\n\n      Actually, we require: \n        A = -11+6*(T-8) <= 0 and 0 <= 0+6*(T-8) -> 0<=6*(T-8) -> always true for T>=8.\n\n      So we need A<=0: -11+6*(T-8)<=0 -> 6*(T-8)<=11 -> T-8 <= 1.833 -> so T=8,9.\n\n      At T=8: [-11,0] -> includes 0 -> unsafe.\n      At T=9: [-11+6= -5, 0+6=6] -> 0 in [-5,6] -> unsafe.\n      At T=10: [-11+12=1, 0+12=12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n  car2: (48,37,right,6): initial [37,48] -> at T=8: 37 to 48, positive. Then at time T: [37+6*(T-8), 48+6*(T-8)] -> always positive and increasing -> never covers 0.\n\nSo freeway 3 is unsafe at T=8 and T=9? and safe for T>=10.\n\nBut wait, at T=8: we are at freeway 2, so we don't care about freeway 3 at T=8. At T=9: if we are on freeway 3, then we must avoid.\n\nNow, freeway 4 to 8: they all have the same two cars: (0,-11,right,6) and (48,37,right,6). So same as freeway 3: the first car (0,-11,right,6) will cover 0 at T=8 and T=9, and then at T>=10, it moves beyond 0. The second car never covers 0.\n\nTherefore, for freeways 4,5,6,7,8: unsafe at T=8 and T=9? Actually, for each freeway k in {3,4,5,6,7,8}, the first car causes unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut note: we are at T=8 at y=2. We are not on freeway 3 to 8 at T=8. So we are safe.\n\nNow, we plan:\n\nWe start at T=8, y=2.\n\nWe want to go to y=9. We must pass through y=3,4,5,6,7,8 and then 9.\n\nWe can only be at a freeway k (for k in 1..8) at time T if at that time, freeway k is safe (i.e., no car covers 0).\n\nWe note that freeway 2 is unsafe only at T=10. So we must avoid being on freeway 2 at T=10.\n\nFreeways 3 to 8 are unsafe at T=8 and T=9, and safe for T>=10.\n\nSo if we try to move up quickly:\n\nAt T=8 (current): we are at y=2. We can choose: U, D, S.\n\nWe want to avoid freeway 2 at T=10? But we are at T=8. We can move up to y=3 at T=9? But then at T=9, we would be at freeway 3, which is unsafe at T=9! So we cannot be at freeway 3 at T=9.\n\nAlternatively, we can stay at y=2 for one turn? Then at T=9, we are still at freeway 2. But freeway 2 is safe at T=9? We computed: freeway 2: unsafe only at T=10. So at T=9, freeway 2 is safe. Then at T=9 we can move up to y=3? But then at T=10 we are at freeway 3. And freeway 3 is safe at T>=10? So at T=10, freeway 3 is safe (because T=10>=10). \n\nBut wait, freeway 3: we said unsafe at T=8 and T=9, and safe at T=10. So at T=10, we can be at freeway 3.\n\nBut note: at T=10, we are at freeway 3. We are safe. Then we can move up to freeway 4 at T=11? But freeway 4 is safe at T>=10? So at T=11, freeway 4 is safe. Similarly for the others.\n\nBut what about freeway 2 at T=10? We must avoid being at freeway 2 at T=10. In this plan, we are at freeway 3 at T=10, so we avoid.\n\nSo plan:\n\n  T=8: at y=2. We choose S (stay). Then at T=9, we are still at y=2 (freeway 2) -> safe (since freeway2 unsafe only at T=10).\n  T=9: we choose U -> y=3. Then at T=10, we are at y=3 (freeway3) -> and freeway3 is safe at T=10? Yes, because T=10: the car on freeway3 (first car) is at [ -11+6*(10-8)= -11+12=1, 0+12=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n  Then we can go up every turn: \n    T=10: U -> y=4 at T=11.\n    T=11: U -> y=5 at T=12.\n    T=12: U -> y=6 at T=13.\n    T=13: U -> y=7 at T=14.\n    T=14: U -> y=8 at T=15.\n    T=15: U -> y=9 at T=16.\n\nBut wait: at T=15, we are at freeway 8. Then at T=15, we must check freeway8: \n  freeway8: same as freeway3: the first car: at T=15: \n      A = -11 + 6*(15-8) = -11 + 42 = 31\n      B = 0 + 42 = 42\n      So [31,42] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n\nThen at T=15: we move U to y=9, so at T=16 we are at y=9 -> goal.\n\nTotal turns: from T=8 to T=16: that's 8 turns? But note: the number of actions is the number of steps from T=8 to T=15 (inclusive) because at T=8 we do the first action, then T=9 the second, ... until T=15 we do the 8th action? And then at T=16 we are at the goal without an action? \n\nBut the problem says: a sequence of actions for t from t1 to t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nSo we take actions at T=8,9,...,15 (8 actions) and then at T=16 we are at (0,9)? But actually, after the last action at T=15, we move to y=9 at T=16? But the problem says: at the turn when we take the last action, we should be at (0,9). \n\nLet me reread: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then after H actions, we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nWait, the indexing: \n  t1 = 8.\n  t = 0: a_{t1+0} = a_8\n  t = 1: a_9\n  ...\n  t = H-1: a_{8+H-1}\n\nAnd then at the next turn (turn 8+H) we would be at the new state? But the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"reach (0,9)\".\n\nBut note: the player update: at turn t, we do action a_t, then we get the state at turn t+1.\n\nSo the state at turn t is the state at the beginning of turn t? And then we do an action and then we are at turn t+1.\n\nWe start at turn t1=8 at (0,2). Then we do action a_8, and then we are at turn 9 at a new y. Then at turn 9 we do a_9, and so on.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at some turn T. We want T to be minimal? But note the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, meaning H actions. Then the turn at which we are at (0,9) is t1 + H? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nLet me check: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\"\n\n  and the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\n\n  and then the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\n  So after the first action (at t1), we get y_{t1+1}. After H actions, we get y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd the answer format: \n  Turn t1: a_{t1}\n  Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n  ...\n\n  and then after the last action (which is at turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9)? \n\nBut that would be: after H actions, we have taken actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the next state (at turn t1+H) would be the state after the last action. But we want to be at (0,9) at the turn when we have just taken the last action? \n\nI think there is a confusion. Let me look at the problem:\n\n  \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\"\n\n  So at turn t, we are at y_t, we do action a_t, and then we get y_{t+1} (at turn t+1).\n\nTherefore, we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H (if we take H actions starting at t1). \n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence has H actions. So the total number of turns from the start to the goal state is H? But note: we start at turn t1 (which is 8) and after H actions we are at turn t1+H. So the total number of turns we are simulating is H? But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", meaning the number of actions? \n\nThe problem: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence has H actions. So H is the number of actions.\n\nAnd we want to be at (0,9) at the turn immediately after the last action, i.e., at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nLooking back: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,0,9)\"\n\n  and then the answer format: \n      Turn t1: a_{t1}\n      Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n      ...\n      Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\n  and then at turn t1+H-1 we take the last action, and then the next state (at turn t1+H) is (0,9).\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nNo, it says: \"reach (0,9)\" without specifying the turn? But the update rule: we are at (0,9) at the next turn after the action.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at a specific turn T, we must have taken an action at turn T-1 that moved us to (0,9). \n\nTherefore, we are at (0,9) at turn T = t1 + H (if we take H actions). \n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... for t=0 to H-1\" meaning H actions, and then we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem also says: \"minimal number of turns H\". So H is the number of turns? Or the number of actions? \n\nThe problem: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence has H actions. So H is the number of actions. \n\nAnd we want the minimal H such that we can be at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\nSo in our plan above: \n  We start at turn 8 at (0,2).\n  We take:\n      T=8: S -> then at T=9: (0,2)\n      T=9: U -> then at T=10: (0,3)\n      T=10: U -> then at T=11: (0,4)\n      T=11: U -> then at T=12: (0,5)\n      T=12: U -> then at T=13: (0,6)\n      T=13: U -> then at T=14: (0,7)\n      T=14: U -> then at T=15: (0,8)\n      T=15: U -> then at T=16: (0,9)\n\nSo we take 8 actions (H=8) and we are at (0,9) at turn 16 (t1+H=8+8=16).\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWe must avoid freeway 3 to 8 at T=8 and T=9. But if we try to go up at T=8 to y=3, then at T=9 we are at freeway 3 -> unsafe. Similarly, if we go up twice: T=8: U -> T=9: y=3 -> unsafe. \n\nAlternatively, can we go up to y=3 at a time when freeway3 is safe? The next safe time for freeway3 is T>=10. So the earliest we can be at freeway3 is T=10.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid freeway2 at T=10. So we cannot be at freeway2 at T=10.\n\nTherefore, we must leave freeway2 by T=9? Because at T=10 we cannot be there. So at T=9, we must move to freeway3? But freeway3 is unsafe at T=9. So we must wait at freeway2 until T=9? Then at T=9 we move to freeway3? But freeway3 is unsafe at T=9? That's the problem.\n\nBut note: we are at freeway2 at T=9: we are safe. Then we take action at T=9: if we choose U, then at T=10 we are at freeway3. And at T=10, freeway3 is safe. So we are not at freeway3 at T=9? We are at freeway3 at T=10.\n\nSo the plan I described is valid.\n\nBut can we do it in 7 actions? The minimal without obstacles is 7 (7 steps of U). But we have to avoid being on freeway3 to freeway8 at T=8 and T=9, and freeway2 at T=10.\n\nIf we try to go up without waiting:\n\n  T=8: U -> y=3 at T=9 -> but at T=9 we are at freeway3 -> unsafe.\n\n  So we must avoid.\n\nAlternatively, we can go up to y=4 at T=10? How? \n\n  T=8: U -> y=3 at T=9 (unsafe) -> not allowed.\n\n  T=8: S -> T=9: y=2 (safe)\n  T=9: U -> T=10: y=3 (safe at T=10) -> then we are at y=3 at T=10.\n\nThen we need to go from y=3 to y=9: 6 steps of U: \n  T=10: U -> T=11: y=4\n  T=11: U -> T=12: y=5\n  T=12: U -> T=13: y=6\n  T=13: U -> T=14: y=7\n  T=14: U -> T=15: y=8\n  T=15: U -> T=16: y=9\n\nSo 8 actions.\n\nBut note: we might be able to go faster by going up two steps? But we can only move one per turn.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to skip some freeways? But we have to go through each freeway? We start at y=2 and go to y=9: we must go through y=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut what if we go up two freeways in two turns? We can only move one per turn.\n\nSo 8 actions seems minimal.\n\nBut wait, what about freeway 1? We haven't considered it. We are starting at y=2, and we go up: we don't go to freeway1 (which is y=1). So we are safe from freeway1? Because we are never on freeway1.\n\nSo the plan:\n\n  Turn 8: S\n  Turn 9: U\n  Turn 10: U\n  Turn 11: U\n  Turn 12: U\n  Turn 13: U\n  Turn 14: U\n  Turn 15: U\n\nAfter 8 actions, we are at (0,9) at turn 16.\n\nBut let me verify the collisions:\n\n  At T=8: we start at (0,2). We choose S -> so we stay at (0,2). Then at T=9, we are at (0,2). \n    At T=9: we are on freeway2 -> check freeway2: \n        Only car: at T=9: [ -83+36*(9-8)= -83+36=-47, -48+36=-12] -> [-47,-12] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n\n  At T=9: we choose U -> then at T=10, we are at (0,3).\n    At T=10: freeway3: \n        car1: [ -11+6*(10-8)= -11+12=1, 0+12=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n        car2: [37+12=49, 48+12=60] -> safe.\n\n  At T=10: U -> T=11: (0,4). \n        freeway4: at T=11: \n            car1: [ -11+6*(11-8)= -11+18=7, 0+18=18] -> [7,18] -> safe.\n        car2: [37+18=55, 48+18=66] -> safe.\n\n  Similarly, freeway5,6,7,8 at T=12,13,14,15 respectively: \n      For freeway5 at T=12: car1: [ -11+6*(12-8)= -11+24=13, 0+24=24] -> safe.\n      freeway6 at T=13: car1: [ -11+6*5=19, 30] -> safe.\n      freeway7 at T=14: car1: [ -11+6*6=25, 36] -> safe.\n      freeway8 at T=15: car1: [ -11+6*7=31, 42] -> safe.\n\n  Then at T=15: we are at (0,8). We choose U -> then at T=16: (0,9) -> goal.\n\nSo the sequence of actions:\n\n  Turn 8: S\n  Turn 9: U\n  Turn 10: U\n  Turn 11: U\n  Turn 12: U\n  Turn 13: U\n  Turn 14: U\n  Turn 15: U\n\nTotal 8 actions.\n\nBut note: we can also consider if we can go faster by using D? For example, if we go down to y=1 at some point? But that would add extra steps. So it's not beneficial.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 8.\n\nBut wait, what if we do:\n\n  T=8: U -> to y=3 at T=9 -> unsafe? So we cannot.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to go to y=1? \n\n  At T=8: we are at y=2. We choose D -> then at T=9: y=1. \n    At T=9: we are on freeway1 -> check freeway1 at T=9.\n\n  Freeway1 at T=9: \n      car1: (-18, -29, right, 6): at T=9: [ -29+6*(1)= -23, -18+6= -12] -> [-23,-12] -> 0 not included.\n      car2: (60,49,right,6): [49+6=55, 60+6=66] -> safe.\n      car3: (24,13,right,6): [13+6=19,24+6=30] -> safe.\n\n  Then at T=9: we are at y=1. Then we can go up? \n      T=9: U -> T=10: y=2. \n          At T=10: freeway2 -> unsafe? because freeway2 is unsafe at T=10: \n                [ -83+36*2= -83+72=-11, -48+72=24] -> 0 in [-11,24] -> unsafe.\n\n  So we cannot be at y=2 at T=10.\n\n  Alternatively, at T=9: we could stay at y=1? Then T=10: at y=1 -> freeway1 at T=10:\n        car1: [-29+12=-17, -18+12=-6] -> 0 not in [-17,-6] -> safe.\n        others safe.\n      Then T=10: we can move to y=2? -> T=11: y=2 -> freeway2 at T=11: \n            [ -83+36*3= -83+108=25, -48+108=60] -> safe? 0 not in [25,60] -> safe.\n      Then we are at y=2 at T=11. Then we need to go to y=9: 7 moves -> total actions: \n          T=8: D (1)\n          T=9: S (2)\n          T=10: U (3) -> T=11: y=2\n          T=11: U -> y=3 at T=12 (4)\n          ... then 6 more U to get to y=9: 4+6=10 actions -> worse.\n\nSo the first plan is better.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and t_1=8. So we start at Turn 8.\n\nBut wait, the minimal H is 8? But we have 8 actions? And then we are at (0,9) at turn 16.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the answer is the above sequence.\n\nBut let me check if we can avoid the initial wait? \n\n  What if we do at T=8: U -> to y=3 at T=9 -> unsafe -> not allowed.\n\n  What if we do at T=8: D -> to y=1 at T=9 -> safe? But then we have to come back, which takes more steps.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do at T=8: S (as above) and then proceed.\n\nSo the above sequence is minimal.\n\nBut note: freeway 2 is only unsafe at T=10. So we must not be at freeway2 at T=10. We can also leave freeway2 earlier? \n\n  We are at y=2 at T=8. We can go up at T=8? -> unsafe at freeway3 at T=9? So no.\n\n  Or we can go up at T=8 to y=3? -> unsafe at freeway3 at T=9? \n\n  But what if we go up at T=8 and then at T=9 we go up again? Then we are at y=4 at T=10? \n\n  However, at T=9 we would be at freeway3 -> unsafe.\n\n  Alternatively, at T=8: U -> to y=3 at T=9 (unsafe) -> not allowed.\n\nSo we cannot avoid the wait.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is 8 actions as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) is 8. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) as follows:\n\n- At turn 8, the player stays at \\(y = 2\\) (action S). Freeway 2 is safe at turn 9 because the car on freeway 2 does not cover \\(x = 0\\) (span \\([-47, -12]\\)).\n- At turn 9, the player moves up to \\(y = 3\\) (action U). Freeway 3 is safe at turn 10 because the cars do not cover \\(x = 0\\) (first car span \\([1, 12]\\), second car span \\([49, 60]\\)).\n- At turn 10, the player moves up to \\(y = 4\\) (action U). Freeway 4 is safe at turn 11 (first car span \\([7, 18]\\), second car span \\([55, 66]\\)).\n- At turn 11, the player moves up to \\(y = 5\\) (action U). Freeway 5 is safe at turn 12 (first car span \\([13, 24]\\), second car span \\([61, 72]\\)).\n- At turn 12, the player moves up to \\(y = 6\\) (action U). Freeway 6 is safe at turn 13 (first car span \\([19, 30]\\), second car span \\([67, 78]\\)).\n- At turn 13, the player moves up to \\(y = 7\\) (action U). Freeway 7 is safe at turn 14 (first car span \\([25, 36]\\), second car span \\([73, 84]\\)).\n- At turn 14, the player moves up to \\(y = 8\\) (action U). Freeway 8 is safe at turn 15 (first car span \\([31, 42]\\), second car span \\([79, 90]\\)).\n- At turn 15, the player moves up to \\(y = 9\\) (action U), reaching the goal at turn 16.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) in 8 actions without collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 9, and the player is at (0,2). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to y=8).\n\nThe player can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y remains). The y-coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway k (i.e., y_T = k, and k in {1,...,8}) and the car on that freeway at that turn has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player). Note that the player is only on the freeway at the exact turn when the y-coordinate is that freeway. Importantly, when moving, the collision check is only for the freeway at the current turn. For example, if at turn T the player is at y_T and moves to y_{T+1} at the next turn, then at turn T the player is only on freeway y_T (if it's between 1 and 8) and not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1.\n\nThe car update: \n- Left-moving: span [h, τ] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] at turn T (relative to t1, which is 9).\n- Right-moving: span [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: in the given car state, the direction is given. In the table, for freeway 1, we have:\n  (-12, -23, right, 6) -> this is a right-moving car. So the initial head is -12 and tail is -23? But for right-moving, the head is the front (which is the larger x) and the tail is the back? Actually, the description for right-moving says: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" meaning the tail is at τ and head at h, and then it moves to [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So in this notation, for a right-moving car, the head is the larger coordinate? Actually, in the example: (-12, -23, right, 6): \n  - Here, head = -12 and tail = -23. But -12 is greater than -23, so the head is at -12 and tail at -23? Then the span is from tail to head: [-23, -12]. But the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" meaning the tail is first? So τ = -23 and h = -12? Then the car spans from -23 to -12 at t1.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] but we don't have any left-moving in this problem? Actually, all cars in the given state are right-moving.\n\nBut wait: the problem states for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. And for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSo in the input, the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). But note the order in the span representation depends on direction.\n\nFor right-moving: the head is the larger coordinate? Actually, in the example: (-12, -23, right, 6): \n  - The head is -12 and tail is -23. Since it's right-moving, the head is the front? But -12 is greater than -23, so the car extends from x = -23 (tail) to x = -12 (head). So the span at t1 is [-23, -12]. Then at a future turn T (relative to t1=9), the car moves right by s*(T-9). So the new head = -12 + 6*(T-9) and the new tail = -23 + 6*(T-9). The span becomes [-23 + 6*(T-9), -12 + 6*(T-9)].\n\nSimilarly, for the car (30,19,right,6) on freeway1: head=30, tail=19? Then the span at t1 is [19,30]. Then at T, it becomes [19+6*(T-9), 30+6*(T-9)].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T on freeway k if the player is at (0,k) and 0 is in the span of any car on freeway k at that turn T.\n\nWe are to compute the minimal H (number of turns) and the sequence of actions from turn t1=9 to turn t1+H-1, such that at the last turn the player is at (0,9).\n\nWe start at y=2 at turn 9. We need to get to y=9. The minimal number of moves without any cars would be 7 moves (all U: 2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9). But we have to avoid cars.\n\nWe must check for each freeway at each turn we are on that freeway whether the car spans on that freeway at that turn cover 0.\n\nWe note that the cars are moving over time. We are starting at turn 9.\n\nWe'll plan a path that minimizes the number of turns, so we prefer moving up as much as possible, but we may have to wait (stay) or even move down to avoid a collision.\n\nHowever, note that the player can only change by at most 1 per turn, so we must go through each y from 2 to 9.\n\nWe'll simulate the future turns starting from turn 9, and for each turn and each possible y, we check if that position is safe and then try to find a path to 9.\n\nBut note: the state space is small: y in [0,9] and time from 9 onward. However, we don't know how many turns we need. We can use BFS (breadth-first search) over the state (y, turn) to find the minimal turns to reach y=9.\n\nBut note: the turn number can be large, but the car positions are linear in time. However, since the cars are moving and the grid is periodic? Actually, the cars are moving at constant speed and the grid is infinite? But we are only concerned with when the car spans cover 0. Since the cars are moving, the spans will eventually leave 0 and then come back? Actually, the freeway is a horizontal line, and the cars are moving at constant speed. The problem is that we have multiple cars per freeway and they are moving continuously.\n\nBut note: the car spans are intervals that move. The collision condition is that 0 is in the interval at the exact turn.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k and for each turn T>=9 whether there is a car on freeway k at turn T that covers 0.\n\nHowever, note that the car positions are linear in time. For a given car on freeway k with initial (at t1=9) span and direction and speed, we can compute the time intervals during which 0 is covered by that car.\n\nBut since there are multiple cars per freeway, we need the union of these intervals for each freeway.\n\nBut note: we are only concerned with the times when the player is on that freeway. However, the player's path is not fixed. Therefore, we might precompute for each freeway k and for each turn T the safety: safe_k(T) = True if at turn T, freeway k has no car covering 0, else False.\n\nBut note: the problem says that if the player is at (0,k) at turn T, then we require safe_k(T) to be true to avoid collision.\n\nSo we can precompute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each turn T>=9, whether freeway k is safe at turn T.\n\nHow to compute for a car?\n\nExample: freeway 1, car1: (-12, -23, right, 6)\nAt turn T (relative to 9: let Δt = T-9), the car span is:\n  tail = -23 + 6*Δt\n  head = -12 + 6*Δt\nWe need to know if 0 is in [tail, head] = [-23+6*Δt, -12+6*Δt].\n\nSolve: \n  -23 + 6*Δt <= 0 <= -12 + 6*Δt\n  => 6*Δt >= 23  => Δt >= 23/6 ≈ 3.833 -> so Δt>=4\n  and 6*Δt <= 12 => Δt <= 2? -> wait, that can't be.\n\nActually, we have:\n  -23 + 6*Δt <= 0  => 6*Δt <= 23 -> Δt <= 23/6 ≈ 3.833 -> so Δt <= 3 (since integer) -> but wait, we need to check the inequalities.\n\nThe interval is [A, B] = [-23+6*Δt, -12+6*Δt]. We need A <= 0 <= B.\n\nSo:\n  1. -23+6*Δt <= 0  => 6*Δt <= 23 => Δt <= 23/6 ≈ 3.833 -> so Δt <= 3 (if Δt is integer) because 3*6=18<23, 4*6=24>23? Actually, at Δt=4: A = -23+24=1, which is greater than 0 -> so 0 is not in the interval.\n\nLet me check:\n  Δt=3: A = -23+18 = -5, B = -12+18=6 -> then -5<=0<=6 -> true.\n  Δt=4: A = -23+24=1, B = -12+24=12 -> then 1<=0? false.\n\nSo this car covers 0 only at Δt=3? Actually, we have to check the boundaries: at Δt=3, the car covers [-5,6] which includes 0.\n\nBut also, what about Δt=2: A = -23+12=-11, B=-12+12=0 -> then -11<=0<=0 -> true? \n  Actually, at Δt=2: the tail is -23+12 = -11, head=-12+12=0. Then the span is [-11,0]. So 0 is included? \n  Yes, because the head is at 0.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=3: [-5,6] -> includes 0.\nΔt=4: [1,12] -> doesn't.\n\nBut what about Δt=0 (T=9): [-23, -12] -> 0 not in.\nΔt=1: [-17, -6] -> no.\nΔt=2: [-11,0] -> yes.\nΔt=3: [-5,6] -> yes.\nΔt=4: [1,12] -> no.\n\nSo for this car, it covers freeway1 at T=9+2=11 and T=9+3=12.\n\nSimilarly, the second car on freeway1: (-48, -59, right, 6)\nAt T: tail = -59+6*Δt, head=-48+6*Δt.\nWe need: -59+6*Δt <= 0 <= -48+6*Δt\n  => 6*Δt >= 48 -> Δt>=8\n     6*Δt <= 59 -> Δt<=59/6≈9.83 -> so Δt in [8,9] (integers: 8,9)\nCheck:\n  Δt=8: tail=-59+48=-11, head=-48+48=0 -> [-11,0] -> includes 0.\n  Δt=9: tail=-59+54=-5, head=-48+54=6 -> includes 0.\n  Δt=10: tail=-59+60=1, head=-48+60=12 -> doesn't.\n\nSo this car covers at T=9+8=17 and 9+9=18.\n\nThird car on freeway1: (30,19,right,6) -> wait, the input says (30,19,right,6). But for a right-moving car, the head is 30 and tail is 19? Then the initial span at t1=9 is [19,30]. Then at T: [19+6*Δt, 30+6*Δt]. \nWe need: 19+6*Δt <= 0 <= 30+6*Δt? \nBut 19+6*Δt is always positive for Δt>=0, so 0 is never in the interval? \nSo this car never covers 0.\n\nTherefore, for freeway1, it is unsafe at T=11,12 (from car1) and T=17,18 (from car2). Also, note that car3 is never at 0.\n\nSo freeway1 is unsafe at T=11,12,17,18.\n\nNow freeway2: only one car: (-12, -47, right, 36)\nThis is right-moving: tail=-47, head=-12 at t1=9.\nAt T: tail = -47 + 36*Δt, head=-12+36*Δt.\nWe need: -47+36*Δt <= 0 <= -12+36*Δt\n  => 36*Δt >= 12 -> Δt>=12/36=1/3 -> so Δt>=1 (since integer) \n     36*Δt <= 47 -> Δt<=47/36≈1.305 -> so Δt=1 only.\nCheck:\n  Δt=1: tail=-47+36=-11, head=-12+36=24 -> [-11,24] includes 0.\n  Δt=0: tail=-47, head=-12 -> doesn't include 0? (since both negative) -> safe.\n  Δt=2: tail=-47+72=25, head=-12+72=60 -> doesn't include 0.\n\nSo freeway2 is unsafe only at T=9+1=10.\n\nNow freeway3: two cars: (6, -5, right, 6) and (54,43,right,6)\n\nFirst car: head=6, tail=-5 -> right-moving: initial span [-5,6] at T=9. Then at T: tail=-5+6*Δt, head=6+6*Δt.\nWe need: -5+6*Δt <= 0 <= 6+6*Δt\n  The second inequality is always true (since 6+6*Δt>=6>0). The first: 6*Δt <=5 -> Δt<=5/6≈0.833 -> so only Δt=0?\nBut check:\n  Δt=0: [-5,6] -> includes 0? yes.\n  Δt=1: [-5+6=1, 6+6=12] -> doesn't include 0? (0<1) -> no.\n\nSo this car covers freeway3 at T=9 only.\n\nBut note: we are at turn 9, and the player is at y=2, so at turn9 the player is not on freeway3 (which is y=3). So we don't care about turn9 for freeway3? Actually, we care for when the player is on freeway3 at a future turn.\n\nAt T=9, the car is at freeway3 and covers 0. But if the player is at freeway3 at T=9, then collision. However, we start at y=2 at T=9, so we are not on freeway3 at T=9.\n\nBut for future turns: \n  The car covers freeway3 at T=9 and only at T=9? Because at T=10: the car moves to [1,12] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\nSecond car on freeway3: (54,43,right,6) -> initial [43,54] at T=9, then at T: [43+6*Δt,54+6*Δt]. This is always positive, so never covers 0.\n\nSo freeway3 is unsafe only at T=9? But we are at T=9 and the player is not on freeway3. So for T>=10, freeway3 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 4 to 8: they all have the same car configurations as freeway3: \n  (6, -5, right, 6) and (54,43,right,6)\n\nSo for freeway k (k=4,5,6,7,8) we have:\n  First car: (6,-5,right,6) -> covers 0 only at T=9 (so unsafe only at T=9).\n  Second car: (54,43,right,6) -> never covers 0.\n\nTherefore, for freeway3: unsafe only at T=9 -> so for T>=10, safe.\nFor freeway4: unsafe only at T=9 -> safe for T>=10.\nSimilarly, freeway5,6,7,8: unsafe only at T=9 -> safe for T>=10.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nFreeway1 (y=1): unsafe at T=11,12,17,18.\nFreeway2 (y=2): unsafe at T=10.\nFreeway3 (y=3): unsafe only at T=9 (but we are at T=9 and not on it, so we don't care for T=9) -> safe for T>=10.\nFreeway4 (y=4): same as freeway3 -> safe for T>=10.\nFreeway5 (y=5): safe for T>=10.\nFreeway6 (y=6): safe for T>=10.\nFreeway7 (y=7): safe for T>=10.\nFreeway8 (y=8): safe for T>=10.\n\nBut note: at T=9, we are at y=2. Freeway2 is unsafe at T=10? So if we are on freeway2 (y=2) at T=10, then collision? But we are at y=2 at T=9. What happens at T=10?\n\nWe can choose an action at T=9: U, D, or S.\n\nIf we choose S at T=9: then at T=10, we are still at y=2. But freeway2 is unsafe at T=10 -> collision.\n\nIf we choose U at T=9: then at T=10, we move to y=3. Then at T=10, we are on freeway3. But freeway3 is safe at T=10 (because unsafe only at T=9). So safe.\n\nIf we choose D at T=9: then at T=10, we are at y=1. Then we are on freeway1 at T=10. Is freeway1 safe at T=10? We computed: freeway1 unsafe at T=11,12,17,18 -> so at T=10, freeway1 is safe? Because the unsafe turns for freeway1 are 11,12,17,18. So at T=10, safe.\n\nBut moving down to y=1 at T=10 is safe? Then we can do that, but that might not be optimal because we are going away from 9.\n\nSo at turn9 (current turn) we have three choices:\n\nOption 1: U -> then at T=10, y=3 (safe, because freeway3 is safe at T=10).\nOption 2: S -> then at T=10, y=2 -> unsafe (because freeway2 is unsafe at T=10) -> not allowed.\nOption 3: D -> then at T=10, y=1 -> safe (freeway1 safe at T=10).\n\nSo we cannot stay. We must move either up or down.\n\nBut we want to minimize the number of turns to reach y=9. Moving down (to y=1) is going away, so that would take more turns. So we prefer up.\n\nSo we choose U at turn9: then at T=10, we are at y=3.\n\nNow, at T=10, we are at y=3. We need to decide action at T=10.\n\nWe can do U, D, or S.\n\nIf we do U: then at T=11, we are at y=4.\nIf we do S: at T=11, still at y=3.\nIf we do D: at T=11, y=2.\n\nNow, we must check safety at T=11 for the freeway we are on at T=11.\n\nFirst, if we do U at T=10: then at T=11, we are at y=4. \n  Freeway4: safe at T=11? (since T=11>=10, so safe) -> yes.\n\nIf we do S: at T=11, y=3 -> safe? yes (freeway3 safe for T>=10).\n\nIf we do D: at T=11, y=2 -> freeway2: unsafe at T=10? but T=11: we computed freeway2 unsafe only at T=10? So at T=11, freeway2 is safe? \n  We computed freeway2 unsafe only at T=10 -> so T=11 is safe.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid freeway1 at T=11 and T=12? But that's for y=1, not y=2.\n\nSo all moves at T=10 are safe? Then we would choose to go up to get closer.\n\nBut we must also consider future risks.\n\nWe know that freeway1 is unsafe at T=11,12,17,18. But if we are on y=4 at T=11, that's safe.\n\nBut what about the path to 9? We have to go from y=3 to y=9: 6 steps if we go up every time. But are there any unsafe freeways in the upper ones? Only freeway1 (y=1) and freeway2 (y=2) have future unsafe turns? The others (y=3 to 8) are safe for T>=10.\n\nSo we can go straight up: \n  T=10: at y=3 -> action U: then T=11: y=4 -> safe (freeway4 safe)\n  T=11: action U: T=12: y=5 -> safe\n  T=12: action U: T=13: y=6 -> safe\n  T=13: action U: T=14: y=7 -> safe\n  T=14: action U: T=15: y=8 -> safe\n  T=15: action U: T=16: y=9 -> goal.\n\nBut wait: at T=11, we are at y=4. What about at T=12? We are at y=5. But note: freeway1 is unsafe at T=11 and 12, but that's for y=1, and we are at y=4 and 5, so we are safe.\n\nSo this path takes 7 moves: from T=9 to T=15 (the last action at T=15 leads to y=9 at T=16). How many turns? \n  We start at T=9, then we have actions at T=9,10,11,12,13,14,15 -> 7 actions, and at T=16 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem: we are to output the sequence of actions from t1 (which is 9) for H turns, and at the end of the sequence (after H actions) we are at (0,9). So H=7.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in fewer? The minimal without obstacles is 7 (from 2 to 9: 7 steps). So we cannot do fewer.\n\nBut is there a problem at T=10? We are at y=3, which is safe. Then T=11: y=4, safe. T=12: y=5, safe. So it seems.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway2? We know freeway2 is unsafe at T=10. But we are not on freeway2 at T=10? We were at T=10 on freeway3. So that's safe.\n\nBut what if we try to move faster? We cannot: we can only move one step per turn.\n\nAlternatively, could we go down and then avoid the unsafe freeway2 at T=10? But we already avoided by going up.\n\nBut note: we are at T=9 at y=2, and we must leave because staying at T=10 at y=2 is unsafe. We went up to y=3 at T=10.\n\nIs there a way to get to 9 in less than 7 moves? No, because we need 7 moves to go from 2 to 9.\n\nBut what if we go down? Then we go to y=1 at T=10. Then at T=10 we are at y=1. But freeway1 is safe at T=10? (since unsafe at 11,12,17,18). Then we can go up from there? But that would take more moves: \n  T=9: D -> y=1 at T=10.\n  Then we need to go from y=1 to y=9: 8 moves? Then total 9 moves? Worse.\n\nSo we stick with the up plan.\n\nBut we must check if at any time we run into an unsafe freeway. We are going to be on:\n  T=9: y=2 -> safe? At T=9, we are at freeway2? \n      Freeway2: unsafe at T=10, but at T=9? We computed freeway2 unsafe only at T=10. \n      How about T=9? \n        The car on freeway2: (-12,-47,right,36): at T=9: tail=-47, head=-12 -> both negative? so 0 not in [-47,-12]? -> safe.\n\nSo at T=9, we are safe at y=2.\n\nThen we do U at T=9: to y=3 at T=10 -> safe (freeway3 at T=10: safe, as we said).\n\nThen we do U at T=10: to y=4 at T=11 -> safe (freeway4 safe at T=11).\n\nBut wait: at T=11, freeway1 is unsafe? But we are on freeway4, so we don't care.\n\nSimilarly, at T=12, freeway1 is unsafe? We are on freeway5 at T=12 (if we continue up) -> safe.\n\nBut what about T=17 and 18? We are going to be at T=16 at y=9? \n  T=9: action0 (U) -> y=3 at T=10.\n  T=10: action1 (U) -> y=4 at T=11.\n  T=11: action2 (U) -> y=5 at T=12.\n  T=12: action3 (U) -> y=6 at T=13.\n  T=13: action4 (U) -> y=7 at T=14.\n  T=14: action5 (U) -> y=8 at T=15.\n  T=15: action6 (U) -> y=9 at T=16.\n\nSo we are done at T=16. We never get to T=17 or 18? So we are safe.\n\nBut what about freeway8? We are on freeway8 at T=15? And freeway8 is safe for T>=10? So safe.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n  Turn 9: U\n  Turn 10: U\n  Turn 11: U\n  Turn 12: U\n  Turn 13: U\n  Turn 14: U\n  Turn 15: U\n\nBut wait, we started at y=2 at T=9. After 7 Ups: \n  T=9: y=2 -> U -> T=10: y=3\n  T=10: y=3 -> U -> T=11: y=4\n  T=11: y=4 -> U -> T=12: y=5\n  T=12: y=5 -> U -> T=13: y=6\n  T=13: y=6 -> U -> T=14: y=7\n  T=14: y=7 -> U -> T=15: y=8\n  T=15: y=8 -> U -> T=16: y=9\n\nSo we have 7 actions, and at the end of the 7th action (at T=15) we are at y=9? \nActually, the player update: after the action at T=15, we get y_{16}=y_{15}+1=9. So at turn T=16, we are at (0,9). The problem says: we must reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThe problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nThe actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then after the last action, we are at turn t1+H, and the position is updated to y_{t1+H}. But the problem says we require at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? \n\nLet me read: \"minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nBut note: the action at turn t is applied to get the next state at t+1. So:\n\n  At turn t1: we are at y_{t1}=2.\n  After action a_{t1} at turn t1, we get y_{t1+1}.\n  After a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1, we get y_{t1+2}.\n  ...\n  After a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1, we get y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? That is, the position at the turn when we take the last action is 9? \n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken and then we update to the next state. So the position at turn t1+H-1 is the state before taking the last action.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nBut in the game dynamics, the position is updated after the action. So:\n\n  At the start of turn t, we are at (0, y_t).\n  Then we choose an action a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nSo the position at turn t is (0, y_t). We want at some turn T = t1+H-1, we have y_T = 9.\n\nBut note: the goal is to be at (0,9) at the turn when we finish? Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nSo we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). But we don't take an action at that turn? \n\nWait, the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1. So we take H actions. The last action is at turn t1+H-1. After that action, we are at y_{t1+H}. But the goal is to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\nThat would mean that we are at 9 at the start of the turn when we take the last action? Then we take an action? But then we leave 9? \n\nAlternatively, the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\", meaning at the end of the last action? \n\nI think there is confusion. Let me look at the problem statement:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0, 9)\"\n\nAnd then: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nBut in the update, the state at turn t1+H is determined by the action at t1+H-1. \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}\" is the position at turn t1+H-1. \n\nBut the goal is to have the player at (0,9) at some turn. The turn when the player is at (0,9) is the turn we care about.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nSo we require that at the turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). \n\nIn our plan, we are at:\n  T=9: y=2\n  T=10: y=3\n  T=11: y=4\n  T=12: y=5\n  T=13: y=6\n  T=14: y=7\n  T=15: y=8\n  T=16: y=9\n\nSo we are at (0,9) at T=16. Therefore, we require t1+H-1 = 16. \n  Since t1=9, then 9+H-1=16 -> H=16-8=8? \n\nBut that doesn't match: we have 7 actions.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that the last action leads to the goal? \n\nLooking at the answer format: we output actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1. And after these H actions, we have reached (0,9) at the next turn? \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nI think we have to be careful. Let me read the problem again:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1, so the actions are at turns: t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nBut the state y_{t} is the position at the beginning of turn t? Or after the action? \n\nIn the game dynamics: \n  \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} at the beginning of turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, the position at turn t is y_t.\n\nWe require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. \n\nBut in our plan, we are at:\n  Turn 9: y9 = 2\n  Turn 10: y10 = 3\n  ...\n  Turn 16: y16 = 9\n\nSo we are at 9 at turn 16. Therefore, we require t1+H-1 = 16 -> 9+H-1=16 -> H=8.\n\nBut we have only 7 actions? How? \n\nThe sequence of actions: \n  We take an action at turn 9 to go from y9=2 to y10=3.\n  Then at turn 10: from y10=3 to y11=4, and so on until turn 15: from y15=8 to y16=9.\n\nSo the actions are taken at turns: 9,10,11,12,13,14,15 -> 7 actions.\n\nBut then the position at turn 16 is 9. However, the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 = 9+H-1, we are at 9. \n\nWe want 9+H-1 = 16? -> H=8. But then we would have 8 actions? \n\nAlternatively, if we require that at the last action turn we are at 9, then we would be at turn t1+H-1 = 16? then 9+H-1=16 -> H=8. But then the last action is at turn 16? and we started at turn 9? \n\nBut then we would have 8 actions: at turns 9,10,...,16. But we don't need an action after we reach 9? \n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. \n\nLet me look at the problem: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nIn the sequence, we take actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the state at the next turn (t1+H) is y_{t1+H}. But the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? \n\nThat means we are at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action? and then we move to y_{t1+H} which might be 10? which is invalid? \n\nAlternatively, if we are at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, and we don't need to take an action? But the sequence has H actions, so we take an action at that turn.\n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9) and then we stop? \n\nThe problem doesn't say we stop. It says we want to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So we must be at (0,9) at that turn, regardless of what we do after? \n\nBut then we are required to take an action at that turn? and then we move away? \n\nThat doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at y_{t1+H-1}? \n\nBut the update rule: after action at turn t, we get y_{t+1}. \n\nI think the problem has a typo. Typically, we take an action at turn t and then we are at the new state at turn t+1. So to be at (0,9) at turn T, we need to have taken an action at turn T-1 that brought us to y_T = 9.\n\nTherefore, the goal is to have y_{t1+H} = 9, and we took H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1) to achieve that.\n\nBut the problem states: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nGiven the confusion, let me see the example: minimal H to go from y=2 to y=9 without obstacles: \n  We start at turn9: y9=2.\n  We take an action at turn9: U -> y10=3.\n  ... \n  We take an action at turn15: U -> y16=9.\n\nSo we took 7 actions (H=7) and we are at y16=9. But the problem says we require y_{9+7-1}=y_{15}=9? But at turn15 we are at y15=8, not 9. \n\nSo that doesn't satisfy.\n\nIf we set H=8: \n  We take 8 actions: at turns9,10,...,16. \n  Then we require y_{9+8-1}=y_{16}=9. \n  How do we get that? \n      At turn9: start at y9=2, then action at turn9: U -> y10=3.\n      ... \n      At turn15: action: U -> y16=9.\n      Then at turn16: we take an action? but we are already at 9. \n\nBut we don't need to take an action at turn16 if we are already at 9? \n\nThe problem requires a sequence of H actions that leads to being at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nWith H=8, we have actions from turn9 to turn16. Then we require at turn t1+H-1 = 9+8-1=16, we are at 9. \n\nBut at the start of turn16, we are at y16. How did we get to y16? By the action at turn15. \n\nSo if we want y16=9, then the action at turn15 must be U from y15=8. \n\nBut then we are at y16=9 at the start of turn16. Then we have to take an action at turn16? which is the last action in the sequence? \n\nBut then after the action at turn16, we move to y17. \n\nThe problem doesn't say we stop after reaching 9. It says we must be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\nSo if we set H=8, then we have:\n  Turn9: a9 -> y10\n  Turn10: a10 -> y11\n  ...\n  Turn16: a16 -> y17\n\nAnd we require y_{16}=9. \n\nBut then at turn16, we are at 9. Then we take an action a16. If we take S, then y17=9. But the requirement is only for turn16.\n\nBut we only care about being at 9 at turn16. \n\nSo we can do:\n  Actions at turn9 to turn15: as before (7 actions) to get to y16=9.\n  Then at turn16: we take an action (the 8th action) but we are already at 9. We can take S to stay at 9? Then y17=9.\n\nBut the requirement is that at turn16 (which is t1+H-1=9+8-1=16) we are at 9. So we are at 9 at the start of turn16. Then we take an action at turn16 (which is the last action) and then we move to y17.\n\nBut the problem doesn't require that we stay at 9, only that we are there at turn16.\n\nSo we can have H=8, and the last action is at turn16. But we were already at 9 at the start of turn16, so we can choose S at turn16 to remain at 9 for the next state.\n\nBut is that minimal? We could have been at 9 at turn15? \n\nHow? \n  We start at turn9: y9=2.\n  We want y15=9? \n      From 2 to 9: 7 moves, so we need 7 actions: at turns9,10,11,12,13,14,15 -> then y16=9.\n      But we require y15=9? \n\nTo be at 9 at turn15 (the start of turn15), then we must have been at 8 at turn14 and then taken U at turn14 to get to 9 at turn15? \n  Then we have actions at turns9,10,11,12,13,14: 6 actions -> then at turn15 we are at 9. \n\nBut that would require H=6? \n\nBut we started at 2, so to get to 9 we need 7 moves? \n\nWait: \n  Turn9: start at 2.\n  Action at turn9: U -> turn10: 3\n  turn10: U -> turn11:4\n  turn11: U -> turn12:5\n  turn12: U -> turn13:6\n  turn13: U -> turn14:7\n  turn14: U -> turn15:8 -> we are not at 9 at turn15.\n\nWe need one more: turn15: U -> turn16:9.\n\nSo to be at 9 at turn15 is impossible because we can only move one per turn.\n\nTherefore, the earliest we can be at 9 is turn16.\n\nSo we must have y16=9. Then we require t1+H-1=16 -> 9+H-1=16 -> H=8.\n\nAnd we take 8 actions: at turns9,10,...,16. \n  The first 7 actions: U from turn9 to turn15: \n        a9=U -> y10=3\n        a10=U -> y11=4\n        ...\n        a15=U -> y16=9\n  Then at turn16: we must take an action. Since we are at 9, we can take S (stay). Then y17=9.\n\nBut we don't care about y17.\n\nSo the sequence would be 8 actions: 7 U and then one S? \n\nBut we can also take U at turn16? But then we would go to 10, which is invalid? \n\nThe update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. So from 9, we cannot go up (to 10) -> so U is not allowed. Similarly, D to 8 is allowed, but we don't want to leave. So we must take S at turn16.\n\nBut the problem only requires that at turn16 we are at 9. We are at 9 at the start of turn16, and then we take an action. The action at turn16 doesn't affect our presence at 9 at turn16.\n\nSo the minimal H is 8.\n\nBut wait: is there a way to be at 9 earlier? Only if we can move faster, but we cannot.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at 9 at an earlier turn by taking a different path? But we have to go through the freeways.\n\nBut note: we are constrained by the unsafe times. We have to avoid freeway2 at T=10 and freeway1 at T=11,12,17,18. But in our path, we are never on freeway1 or freeway2 after T=9? \n  At T=9: we are at freeway2 (safe) -> then we move up to freeway3 at T=10 (safe) and then we are in the clear.\n\nSo we cannot get there faster.\n\nTherefore, we must have H=8.\n\nBut let me confirm the unsafe freeways again:\n\nWe are on:\n  T=9: y=2 (freeway2) -> safe? \n        freeway2: at T=9: car: (-12,-47,right,36) -> span [-47,-12] -> doesn't include 0 -> safe.\n  T=10: y=3 (freeway3) -> safe? \n        freeway3: at T=10: car1: (6,-5,right,6) -> at T=10: tail=-5+6*(10-9)=1, head=6+6=12 -> [1,12] -> doesn't include 0.\n                  car2: (54,43,right,6) -> [43+6,54+6]=[49,60] -> safe.\n  T=11: y=4 (freeway4) -> similarly: car1: at T=11: tail=-5+6*(11-9)= -5+12=7, head=6+12=18 -> [7,18] -> safe.\n        car2: [43+12,54+12]=[55,66] -> safe.\n  ... and so on.\n\nSo the path is safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of actions for H=8:\n\n  Turn 9: U\n  Turn 10: U\n  Turn 11: U\n  Turn 12: U\n  Turn 13: U\n  Turn 14: U\n  Turn 15: U  -> this gets us to y16=9 at the start of turn16.\n  Turn 16: S  -> we stay at 9.\n\nBut note: at turn16, we are at y16=9. Then we take action S, which leaves us at y17=9. But the problem doesn't require anything beyond turn16.\n\nHowever, the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1=9+8-1=16, we are at 9. And we are.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: S\n}\n\nBut wait: we have 8 actions, and at turn16 (after the 8th action) we get y17=9? But we require y16=9. \n\nNo: \n  At the start of turn16, we are at y16. How did we get y16? \n      y16 = y15 + Δy_{15}. \n      We set a15 (turn15) to U, and y15=8, so y16=9.\n\nSo at the start of turn16, we are at y16=9. Then we take the action at turn16: S, which sets y17=9. \n\nBut the requirement is that at turn16 (which is the start of turn16) we are at 9. So we are. \n\nThe action at turn16 is taken after we are already at 9. \n\nSo we are at 9 at the start of turn16, so we satisfy the condition. The action at turn16 is just to have 8 actions, but it doesn't affect the condition.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to take an action at turn16 even though we are at the goal? The problem doesn't say we stop.\n\nSo this is acceptable.\n\nBut is there a way to have H=7? \n  Then we require y_{9+7-1}=y_{15}=9. \n  How to achieve that? \n      We start at y9=2.\n      After 6 actions (from turn9 to turn14): we can get to y15=8? (because 2+6=8).\n      Then at turn15: we take the 7th action: U -> then y16=9. \n      But then at turn15, we are at y15=8, not 9.\n\nSo we cannot achieve y15=9.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 8.\n\nBut note: we could do 7 actions without the extra S? \n  Then we would have actions from turn9 to turn15 (7 actions) and we require y_{15}=9? \n  But we only get to y16=9. \n\nSo we must have H=8.\n\nOne more thing: at turn16, when we are at y=9, we are not on any freeway (freeways are y=1..8), so no collision check. But we still have to take the action.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". When we are at y=9 (or y=0), we are not on a freeway. So at turn16, we are at y16=9 -> safe.\n\nThen we take S: and go to y17=9 -> also safe.\n\nBut we only care about collisions during the journey? The requirement is to reach (0,9) without collision, and we do.\n\nSo final answer:\n\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: S\n\nBut note: the player starts at (0,2) at turn9. We are taking action at turn9 to go to y=3 at turn10. Then we go up until turn15: from y15=8 to y16=9. Then at turn16, we take S to stay.\n\nSo the sequence is 8 actions.\n\nBut let me verify the safety at turn16: we are at y=9, which is not a freeway (freeways 1-8), so no collision.\n\nHowever, what if we take U at turn16? We cannot because 9+1=10 is not in [0,9]. So the only allowed actions at y=9 are D or S. We choose S to remain.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose D? But that would leave the goal. But the problem doesn't say we have to stay, only that we reach at turn16. So even if we choose D, we were at 9 at the start of turn16. But then we move to 8 at turn17. But that is after the turn we care about.\n\nBut to be safe, we choose S.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: S\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=8. Is there a path with H=8 that gets us to y16=9 without the extra action? \n\nNo, because we need 7 moves to go from 2 to 9, so we need 7 actions to get to y16=9. Then we need an 8th action for the sequence of 8 actions? \n\nBut the sequence of actions must be exactly H in number. And we are required to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1=16. \n\nSo this is minimal.\n\nBut what if we could wait somewhere? For example, if we wait at some safe freeway to avoid an unsafe turn? But in this case, we don't need to wait. \n\nAlternatively, is there a path that takes 8 moves but gets to 9 at an earlier turn? No.\n\nSo we are confident.\n</think>\nTo reach the goal position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined.

Since \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway (freeways are y=1 to 8), no collision check is needed.\n- **Action at turn 16: S (stay)**:\n  - At turn 17, \\(y = 9\\). This action is taken to complete the sequence of 8 actions, but the goal is already achieved at turn 16.\n\nThis path avoids all unsafe freeways:\n- Freeway 2 is unsafe at turn 10, but the player moves to y=3 at turn 10.\n- Freeway 1 is unsafe at turns 11, 12, 17, and 18, but the player is never on y=1 during these turns.\n- Freeways 3 to 8 are unsafe only at turn 9 (not relevant as the player is not on them at turn 9) and safe for turns \\(\\geq 10\\).\n\nThe sequence minimizes \\(H\\) as reaching y=9 from y=2 requires at least 7 upward moves, but the earliest turn to reach y=9 is turn 16 (since each move takes one turn). Thus, \\(H = 8\\) is minimal.\n\n### Answer:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. Collision happens only if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T and there's a car on that freeway where 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. All cars are moving right, according to the table. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)], where t_1 is the current turn, which is 10.\n\nt_1 = 10 is the starting turn. So for any future turn T, the time elapsed is T - 10.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - 10, so at time T, Δt = T - 10.\n\nFor a car with head h, tail τ, speed s, right-moving, the span at T is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]. Since it's right-moving, head is greater than tail, I think. In the span, for right-moving, it's [τ, h] at t_1, so at T, it's [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt].\n\n0 is the x-coordinate where the player is, always at x=0.\n\nThe player is always at x=0, y changing.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to 8, each freeway has cars moving.\n\nI need to avoid being on a freeway y when at that turn, for some car on y, 0 is in the car's span.\n\nThe note says: if I move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so no collision there until I actually arrive.\n\nThe update is: at turn T, I choose action, which determines y_{T+1}, but during turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nWhen I perform an action at turn T, it affects y_{T+1}.\n\nSo at the start of turn T, I am at y_T. I choose a_T, which sets y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nThen during turn T, I am at y_T, and if y_T is between 1 and 8, I need to check for cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nIf I move, at the next turn I'll be at y_{T+1}, but during T, I'm still at y_T.\n\nThe note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nYes, so at turn T, you are on y_T, not on y_{T+1}.\n\nFor example, if at turn T I am at y=3, and I move up to y=4, during turn T I am on freeway y=3, so I need to avoid collision with cars on y=3 at time T. Then at turn T+1, I am on y=4, and need to avoid collision with cars on y=4 at time T+1.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay, y_{T+1} = y_T, so I'm on the same freeway at both turns, but for collision, it's per turn.\n\nNow, I start at turn t_1=10, position (0,3).\n\nI need to reach (0,9), which is above all freeways, so y=9 is safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision possible there.\n\nBut I start at y=3, which has cars, so I need to make sure that at turn 10, when I'm at y=3, there is no collision with cars on y=3.\n\nSimilarly for other turns.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars on each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: cars: (-6,-17,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6), (36,25,right,6)\n\nFor right-moving, head should be greater than tail? In the span, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor the first car: head=-6, tail=-17? -6 > -17, so if right-moving, head should be on the right, so tail -17, head -6, meaning the car is from x=-17 to x=-6, and moving right.\n\nSimilarly, second: head=-42, tail=-53? -42 > -53, so from -53 to -42.\n\nBut head and tail: let's see the values.\n\nFirst car: head=-6, tail=-17, so span at t_1=10 is [τ, h] = [-17, -6]? But in the table it says (head, tail), so for right-moving, I think head is the front, so span is [tail, head] if tail < head.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nSo τ is tail, h is head, and for right-moving, h > τ usually.\n\nIn the first car: h=-6, τ=-17, so h > τ since -6 > -17.\n\nSimilarly, second: h=-42, τ=-53, -42 > -53.\n\nThird: h=36, τ=25, 36>25.\n\nAll good.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2: only one car: (24, -11, right, 36)\n\nh=24, τ=-11, so span at t_1: [-11, 24]\n\nSpeed 36.\n\nFreeway 3 to 8: all have the same cars: (12,1,right,6) and (60,49,right,6)\n\nFor each, h=12, τ=1? τ=1, h=12, so span [1,12] at t_1.\n\nAnd (60,49), h=60, τ=49, span [49,60].\n\nSpeed 6 for all.\n\nNow, I need to find when a car on a freeway has 0 in its span at time T.\n\nFor a given freeway and time T, with Δt = T - 10.\n\n0 ∈ [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] for some car.\n\nSince the car is moving, I need to find for each freeway, at what times the freeway is occupied at x=0.\n\nThat is, when 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway.\n\nThen, for me to be safe on a freeway y at time T, I need that at time T, no car on y has 0 in its span.\n\nIf I'm on y=0 or y=9, no issue.\n\nNow, I start at turn 10, y=3.\n\nFirst, at turn 10, I am on freeway y=3. So I need to check if at time 10, there is a car on y=3 with 0 in span.\n\nFor y=3, cars: (12,1,right,6) and (60,49,right,6)\n\nAt t_1=10, Δt=0.\n\nSpan first car: [1 + 6*0, 12 + 6*0] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12].\n\nSecond car: [49,60], 0 not in [49,60].\n\nSo at turn 10, y=3 is safe, I can be there.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since I start at y=3, need to go to y=9, that's 6 steps up, but I might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, but moving down might not help since I need to go up, and y=0 is safe but I can't go below 0.\n\ny is from 0 to 9, so I can go to y=0, but since I need to reach y=9, going down might waste turns.\n\nBut I might need to wait sometimes if a freeway is occupied.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nThat is, for each y, find T such that 0 ∈ span of some car on y at time T.\n\nSince all freeways except 1 and 2 have the same cars, I can group them.\n\nFirst, freeway y=1.\n\nCars on y=1:\n\nCar A: τ=-17, h=-6, s=6, right\n\nCar B: τ=-53, h=-42, s=6, right\n\nCar C: τ=25, h=36, s=6, right\n\nFor car A: span at T: [ -17 + 6 Δt, -6 + 6 Δt ]\n\n0 ∈ this if -17 + 6 Δt <= 0 <= -6 + 6 Δt\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet's solve for each when 0 in span.\n\nCar A: -17 + 6 Δt <= 0 <= -6 + 6 Δt\n\nLeft: -17 + 6 Δt <= 0 => 6 Δt <= 17 => Δt <= 17/6 ≈ 2.833\n\nRight: 0 <= -6 + 6 Δt => 6 Δt >= 6 => Δt >= 1\n\nSo for Δt from 1 to 2.833, i.e., Δt =1,2 since Δt integer? T is turn, so Δt integer, T integer.\n\nt_1=10, T turn number, integer, so Δt = T-10 integer.\n\nSo for car A: Δt >=1 and Δt <= 17/6≈2.833, so Δt=1,2\n\nAt Δt=1: [ -17+6= -11, -6+6=0] so [ -11, 0], 0 is included.\n\nAt Δt=2: [ -17+12= -5, -6+12=6], [ -5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=3: [ -17+18=1, -6+18=12], [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, car B: τ=-53, h=-42, s=6\n\n[ -53 + 6 Δt, -42 + 6 Δt ]\n\n0 ∈ if -53 + 6 Δt <= 0 <= -42 + 6 Δt\n\nLeft: -53 + 6 Δt <=0 => 6 Δt <=53 => Δt <=53/6≈8.833\n\nRight: 0 <= -42 + 6 Δt => 6 Δt >=42 => Δt >=7\n\nSo Δt from 7 to 8.833, so Δt=7,8\n\nAt Δt=7: [ -53+42= -11, -42+42=0] [ -11,0], 0 in\n\nAt Δt=8: [ -53+48= -5, -42+48=6] [ -5,6], 0 in\n\nAt Δt=9: [ -53+54=1, -42+54=12] [1,12], 0 not in\n\nCar C: τ=25, h=36, s=6\n\n[25 + 6 Δt, 36 + 6 Δt]\n\n0 ∈ if 25 + 6 Δt <= 0 <= 36 + 6 Δt\n\nBut 25 + 6 Δt >=25 >0 for Δt>=0, so left inequality 25+6Δt <=0 false, so 0 never in span for car C.\n\nSimilarly, 36+6Δt >0 always.\n\nSo car C never at x=0.\n\nSo for y=1, occupied when car A or B at x=0.\n\nCar A at Δt=1,2; car B at Δt=7,8.\n\nSo at T=11,12 (Δt=1,2) and T=17,18 (Δt=7,8)\n\nT=10 + Δt, so at T=11 and 12, occupied by car A.\n\nAt T=17 and 18, occupied by car B.\n\nNow freeway y=2.\n\nOnly one car: τ=-11, h=24, s=36, right\n\nSpan: [ -11 + 36 Δt, 24 + 36 Δt ]\n\n0 ∈ if -11 + 36 Δt <= 0 <= 24 + 36 Δt\n\nRight: 0 <= 24 + 36 Δt always true for Δt >=0\n\nLeft: -11 + 36 Δt <=0 => 36 Δt <=11 => Δt <= 11/36 ≈0.305\n\nSince Δt >=0 integer, Δt <=0.305, so Δt=0\n\nAt Δt=0: [ -11, 24], -11<=0<=24, yes 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=1: [ -11+36=25, 24+36=60], [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at Δt=0, T=10.\n\nBut at T=10, Δt=0, occupied.\n\nNow, at turn 10, I am on y=3, not y=2, so for y=2, it is occupied at T=10, but I'm not on it at that time.\n\nFor other times, not occupied.\n\nNow freeways y=3 to y=8: all have same cars.\n\nCar D: τ=1, h=12, s=6, right\n\nCar E: τ=49, h=60, s=6, right\n\nFor car D: span [1 + 6 Δt, 12 + 6 Δt]\n\n0 ∈ if 1 + 6 Δt <= 0 <= 12 + 6 Δt\n\nLeft: 1+6Δt <=0? 1+6Δt >=1>0 for Δt>=0, so false, 0 never <= left part.\n\n0 <= 12+6Δt always true, but 1+6Δt <=0 false, so 0 not in [1+6Δt, 12+6Δt] for any Δt.\n\nSimilarly, car E: [49+6Δt, 60+6Δt], min 49>0, so 0 never in.\n\nTherefore, for freeways y=3 to y=8, no car ever has 0 in its span at any time. They are always away from x=0.\n\nCar D: at Δt=0, [1,12], 1>0, so x=0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo y=3 to y=8 are always safe? But at turn 10, I am on y=3, and it was safe, as we saw.\n\nAnd for any other time, since no car covers x=0, I can be on y=3 to y=8 at any time without collision.\n\nIs that right?\n\nFor example, y=3: car D at [1,12] at t=10, which is from x=1 to 12, so x=0 not included.\n\nSimilarly, as time increases, it moves right, to [7,18] at Δt=1, etc., always x>=1, so x=0 never occupied.\n\nSimilarly car E at [49,60] or later, always x>=49>0.\n\nSo yes, for freeways 3 to 8, since the cars are to the right or left but never cover x=0, they are always safe to be on.\n\nNow freeway y=1 is only occupied at T=11,12,17,18.\n\ny=2 is occupied only at T=10.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nI start at turn 10, y=3.\n\ny=3 is safe at turn 10, as we saw.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nSince y=3 to y=8 are all safe at all times, I can just move up directly without any problem.\n\nBut y=4 to y=8 are also safe, but I need to go through them.\n\nFrom y=3 to y=9, I need to increase y by 6.\n\nEach up move increases y by 1.\n\nI can do U 6 times.\n\nBut let's see if I can do it in 6 turns.\n\nStart: turn 10, y=3\n\nAfter action, at turn 11, y depends on action at turn 10.\n\nI need to specify the sequence.\n\nTurn t: I am at y_t, I choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, and collision check is for y_T at time T.\n\nFor example, at turn 10: I am at y=3, which is safe.\n\nI choose a_{10}, which could be U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, y_{11} = 4\n\nIf D, y_{11} = 2\n\nIf S, y_{11} = 3\n\nThen at turn 11, I am at y_{11}, and so on.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + H -1 should be (0,9).\n\nt_1=10, so at turn 10 + H -1, y=9.\n\nSet T_start = 10.\n\nI need min H such that at turn T_start + H -1, y =9.\n\nAnd during the sequence, for each turn from T_start to T_start + H -1, when I am on a freeway, it must be safe at that turn.\n\nNow, since y=3 to y=8 are always safe, I can be on them any time.\n\ny=1 and y=2 have some unsafe times, but since I start at y=3 and go up, I may not need to go to y=1 or y=2.\n\ny=0 is safe, but below.\n\nSo probably, I can just go up directly.\n\nStart: turn 10, y=3, safe.\n\nI choose U, then at turn 11, I am at y=4.\n\nNow, at turn 11, y=4, which is safe since y=4 is between 3 and 8, always safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can keep going up.\n\nBut y=9 is not a freeway, so no cars.\n\nLet's list the turns.\n\nTurn 10: position y=3, safe.\n\nAction a_{10}: if I choose U, then y_{11} = 4\n\nAt turn 11: y=4, safe (since freeway 4 is always safe)\n\nSimilarly, a_{11}: U, y_{12} =5\n\nTurn 12: y=5, safe\n\na_{12}: U, y_{13}=6\n\nTurn 13: y=6, safe\n\na_{13}: U, y_{14}=7\n\nTurn 14: y=7, safe\n\na_{14}: U, y_{15}=8\n\nTurn 15: y=8, safe\n\na_{15}: U, y_{16}=9\n\nNow at turn 16: y=9, which is the goal, and no cars.\n\nSo I reached at turn 16.\n\nH: from t=10 to t=16, that's 7 turns? Let's see the indices.\n\nStart at turn 10, after H turns, I have taken H actions, from t=10 to t=10+H-1.\n\nAfter k actions, I am at turn 10 + k.\n\nAt turn 10, before any action, I am at y=3.\n\nAfter 0 actions, turn 10, y=3.\n\nAfter first action (at turn 10), at turn 11, y_{11}.\n\nAfter second action (turn 11), at turn 12, y_{12}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn 10 + H.\n\nAnd I need y_{10 + H} =9? No.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + H -1 should be (0,9).\n\nt_1=10, so turn 10 + H -1.\n\nFor example, after H actions, I have moved to turn 10 + H.\n\nAt turn 10 + H, I have y_{10+H}.\n\nBut the turn when I reach is turn 10 + H -1? Let's clarify.\n\nDefine: at the beginning of turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nAt turn t, I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nThe sequence of positions: y_{t_1}, y_{t_1+1}, ..., up to y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe actions are from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, each affecting the next position.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn T from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, I am at y_T, and it must be safe at that turn.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nIn my earlier plan:\n\nAt turn 10: y=3\n\na_{10} = U, so y_{11} =4\n\nThen at turn 11: y=4\n\na_{11} = U, y_{12} =5\n\nTurn 12: y=5\n\na_{12} = U, y_{13} =6\n\nTurn 13: y=6\n\na_{13} = U, y_{14} =7\n\nTurn 14: y=7\n\na_{14} = U, y_{15} =8\n\nTurn 15: y=8\n\na_{15} = U, y_{16} =9\n\nNow, at turn 16: y=9, but turn 16 is after action a_{15}.\n\nI need to have y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1 = 10 + H -1.\n\nSet 10 + H -1 = 16, then 9 + H =16, H=7.\n\nTurns from 10 to 16? Turn 10 to turn 16 is 7 turns.\n\nAt turn 10: y=3\n\nTurn 11: y=4\n\nTurn 12: y=5\n\nTurn 13: y=6\n\nTurn 14: y=7\n\nTurn 15: y=8\n\nTurn 16: y=9\n\nSo at turn 16, y=9, which is turn t_1 + 6, since 10 + 6 =16.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =16, t_1=10, so 10 + H -1 =16, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nActions from a_{10} to a_{15}, that's 6 actions? a_{10} to a_{15} is 6 actions, but H is the number of turns? The sequence of actions is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor example, t=0: a_{t_1} = a_{10}\n\nt=1: a_{11}\n\n...\n\nt=H-1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nAnd after that, at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H, I am at y_{t_1 + H}, but the position is set at the beginning of the turn.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at turn T, for some T.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 16, y=9, which is turn t_1 + 6.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =16, so H-1=6, H=7.\n\nThe actions: I have a_{10} to a_{15}, 6 actions, but H=7 turns? The turns covered are from turn 10 to turn 16, 7 positions.\n\nThe minimal H is the number of turns from start to end, including the start turn.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to specify actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nIn this case, with H=7, actions a_{10} to a_{15}, and y_{16} =9, but y_{16} is at turn 16, which is after a_{15}, so at turn 16, y=9.\n\nBut turn 16 is t_1 + 6, not t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =10 +7 -1=16, yes.\n\nH=7, t_1 + H -1 =10+7-1=16.\n\nAnd y_{16}=9.\n\nIn the sequence, for each turn from 10 to 15, I was on freeways, but all safe.\n\nTurn 10: y=3, safe\n\nTurn 11: y=4, safe\n\nTurn 12: y=5, safe\n\nTurn 13: y=6, safe\n\nTurn 14: y=7, safe\n\nTurn 15: y=8, safe\n\nTurn 16: y=9, safe\n\nAnd no issues.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nH=7, but I need minimal H.\n\nSince I start at y=3, and need to get to y=9, I must increase y by 6, so at least 6 up moves, but since I start at turn 10, and end at some turn, with H turns including start, the minimal H is 7, with 6 up moves.\n\nI could do it in H=7 with all up.\n\nBut is there a way to do it faster? No, because each move changes y by at most 1, from 3 to 9, difference 6, so at least 6 moves, but with H turns, since I start at turn 10 with y=3, after k moves, I am at turn 10+k with y=3 + net up.\n\nTo have y=9, I need net +6 in y, so at least 6 actions, and thus at least H=7 turns (from turn 10 to turn 10+6=16).\n\nMinimal H is 7.\n\nIn this case, it works with all U.\n\nBut I need to make sure that during the sequence, no collision.\n\nIn the sequence above, all freeways from 3 to 8 are safe at all times, so no problem.\n\nBut what about freeway 1 at turn 11 and 12? At turn 11, I am on y=4, not y=1, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, turn 12, y=5, not y=1.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions from turn t_1 onwards.\n\nt_1=10.\n\nSo for H=7:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nThen at turn 11, y=4, action U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 15: U\n\nThen at turn 16, y=9.\n\nActions: a_{10} to a_{15}, all U.\n\na_{15} is at turn 15, which sets y_{16}=9.\n\nAnd at turn 15, I am at y=8, which is safe.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, I don't have action for turn 16, because at turn 16, I am already at y=9, and I don't need to move, but the sequence is up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which is a_{15} for H=7.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =10+7-1=16? 10+6=16, t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =16 when H=7.\n\na_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{16}?\n\nI think I confused the indexing.\n\nSet T = turn number.\n\nStart at T=10, y=3.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn T_final.\n\nThe sequence of actions starts at T=10.\n\nAfter each action, I move to next turn.\n\nSo, actions at T=10,11,12,... up to some T.\n\nLet the actions be from time T=10 to T=10 + K -1, for K actions.\n\nThen after K actions, I am at turn T=10 + K.\n\nAnd y_{10 + K} should be 9? No.\n\nAt turn T, after action at T-1, I am at y_T.\n\nFor T from 10 to T_final, with y_{T_final} =9.\n\nThe actions are taken at turns from 10 to T_final -1.\n\nNumber of actions: from 10 to T_final -1, that's (T_final - 10) actions.\n\nThen H, the number of turns, is from T=10 to T_final, which is T_final - 9 turns? T from 10 to T_final inclusive is (T_final - 10 +1) = T_final -9 turns.\n\nIn the problem, \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nSo, actions: t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter these H actions, I am at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H.\n\nBut I need to be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, I am at position y_{t_1 + H -1}, and I choose action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which sets y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut for the position to be (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1, that means before taking action at that turn, I am at (0,9).\n\nIn other words, at the beginning of turn t_1 + H -1, I am at (0,9), and I may or may not take an action, but since I have to reach there, and the sequence includes a_{t_1 + H -1}, which could be anything, but since I'm already at y=9, I can choose S or whatever, but y=9, if I choose U, y_{t_1 + H} =10, but y=10 is invalid, since y max 9.\n\ny in [0,9], so at y=9, I cannot go up, must go D or S.\n\nBut in this case, since I reach at turn t_1 + H -1, and I need to be there, so at that turn, I am at y=9, and I take some action, but the action doesn't change the fact that I reached, as long as at that turn I am at (0,9).\n\nFor example, in my sequence, I reach at turn 16, y=9.\n\nSo turn t_1 + H -1 =16, t_1=10, so 10 + H -1 =16, thus H=7.\n\nActions from a_{10} to a_{15}? a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: a_{10}\n\nt=1: a_{11}\n\n...\n\nt=H-1: a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{16} for H=7? t_1 + H -1 =10 +7 -1=16.\n\na_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{16}\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 16, I take action a_{16}, but at the beginning of turn 16, I am at y_{16}, and I choose a_{16}, which sets y_{17}.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1 =16.\n\nSo at turn 16, y_{16} must be 9.\n\nThen I take action a_{16}, which could be S to stay, or D to go down, but since I reached at turn 16, it's fine.\n\nIn the action sequence, for H=7, actions at t=10 to 16? t_1 to t_1 + H -1 =10 to 16.\n\nActions at turn 10,11,12,13,14,15,16.\n\nBut at turn 16, when I take action, y_{16} is already 9, and I set y_{17}.\n\nBut I don't care about after.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, it includes a_{16}, but since I reach at turn 16, it should be included.\n\nIn my earlier sequence, I had actions from a_{10} to a_{15}, which set y_{11} to y_{16}, with y_{16}=9.\n\nBut at turn 16, I don't take an action if I stop, but the sequence must include up to the turn where I reach.\n\nAccording to the problem, the sequence {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} brings me to (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter taking actions from t=0 to H-1, at turn t_1 + H -1, I am at (0,9).\n\nThe actions are taken at times t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, which are turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter taking a_{t_1 + H -1}, I set y_{t_1 + H}, but the position at turn t_1 + H -1 is before taking the action or after?\n\nI think I have confusion.\n\nStandard: at the beginning of turn T, I am at position P_T.\n\nI choose action a_T, which determines P_{T+1}.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am at P_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nThe position P_T is defined at turn T.\n\nFor turn T, collision check based on P_T.\n\nIn the sequence, to be at (0,9) at turn T, that means P_T = (0,9).\n\nThe actions to get there are a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{T-1}, which set P_{t_1+1}, P_{t_1+2}, ..., P_T.\n\nFor example, to have P_T = (0,9).\n\nThe number of actions is from t_1 to T-1, that's (T - t_1) actions.\n\nThen the number of turns from start to T is (T - t_1 + 1).\n\nH is the minimal such that at turn t_1 + H -1, P_{t_1 + H -1} = (0,9).\n\nSo for P_{t_1 + H -1} = (0,9).\n\nThe actions are a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2} for the moves to set the positions, but the sequence includes a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which is H actions.\n\nFor example, start at turn t_1, P_{t_1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, P_{t_1+1} is set.\n\nAfter a_{t_1 + H -1}, P_{t_1 + H} is set.\n\nBut I need P_{t_1 + H -1} = (0,9).\n\nP_{t_1 + H -1} is set by action a_{t_1 + H -2}, for H>=2.\n\nIf H=1, then at turn t_1, P_{t_1} must be (0,9), but here P_{10} = (0,3) != (0,9), so H>1.\n\nGenerally, for P_{t_1 + H -1} to be (0,9), it is set by action a_{t_1 + H -2} (for H>=2).\n\nThen action a_{t_1 + H -1} is taken at turn t_1 + H -1, which sets P_{t_1 + H}, but since we reached at turn t_1 + H -1, we don't care about P_{t_1 + H}.\n\nIn the sequence, we include a_{t_1 + H -1}, which can be S or D or U, but at y=9, U is invalid, so we must choose S or D, but S is fine.\n\nIn my case, with all U, I have P_{16} = (0,9).\n\nSo turn t_1 + H -1 =16, t_1=10, so 10 + H -1 =16, H=7.\n\nP_{16} =9.\n\nActions from a_{10} to a_{15} set P_{11} to P_{16}.\n\nP_{11} to P_{16} with P_{16}=9.\n\nThen action a_{16} is also in the sequence for t=H-1=6, a_{t_1 +6} =a_{16}.\n\nBut at turn 16, I am at P_{16}=9, then I take a_{16}, which could be S, to stay at 9.\n\nIf I choose U, y_{17}=10 invalid, so I should choose S or D, but S is better.\n\nIn the sequence, for t=0 to H-1=6, actions at 10 to 16.\n\nBut a_{16} is after reaching.\n\nTo avoid confusion, in this case, with all U from turn 10 to 15, I reach at turn 16.\n\nThen for the sequence, actions a_{10} to a_{15} are U, and a_{16} should be S or something.\n\nBut in the minimal sequence, I can stop at turn 15 or something.\n\nLet's see if I can reach earlier.\n\nMinimal H: since I start at y=3, need to go to y=9, min 6 up moves, so min reach at turn 16.\n\nP_{10} =3\n\nAfter one U, P_{11}=4\n\n...\n\nAfter six U, P_{16}=9.\n\nSo turn 16 is earliest.\n\nH=7, with P_{16}=9 at turn t_1 + H -1 =10+7-1=16.\n\nActions: a_{10} to a_{15} are U, and a_{16} is at turn 16, but since I am already at y=9, I can choose a_{16}=S.\n\nIn the sequence, I must include a_{16} as part of the H actions.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so for t=0, a_{10}, t=1, a_{11}, ..., t=5, a_{15}, t=6, a_{16} for H=7.\n\na_{10} to a_{15} are the actions that move me from turn 10 to 16.\n\na_{16} is extra, at turn 16, when I am already at y=9.\n\nSo I can set a_{16}=S.\n\nBut in terms of the path, I reached at turn 16 with actions up to a_{15}.\n\nBut the sequence must have H actions, including a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nSimilarly, I could reach at turn 15 with y=9, but is it possible?\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 15.\n\nP_{15}=9.\n\nFrom P_{10}=3, in 5 turns, from turn 10 to 15, that's 5 steps, I need to increase y by 6, which requires net +6 in 5 moves, so I must have 6 up and -1 down or something, but each move changes by at most 1, so max increase in 5 moves is 5, to y=8, not 9.\n\nStart at turn 10, y=3.\n\nAfter 1 move, turn 11, y=3 or 4 or 2.\n\nAfter 2 moves, turn 12, y from 1 to 5.\n\n...\n\nAfter k moves, turn 10+k, y from max(0,3-k) to min(9,3+k).\n\nTo have y=9 at turn 15, turn 15 = 10 + 5, so after 5 moves, y=9.\n\nBut y start 3, after 5 moves, max y=3+5=8, min y=3-5=-2, but clipped to 0-9, so y<=8.\n\nThus at turn 15, y cannot be 9, maximum y=8.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 16, y can be 9.\n\nSo minimal to reach at turn 16 with H=7.\n\nWith actions all U from a_{10} to a_{15}, setting y_{11}=4, y_{12}=5, ..., y_{16}=9.\n\nThen at turn 16, I need to include a_{16}, which I can set to S.\n\nBut in the sequence, for the freeway, at turn 16, y=9, no freeway, so no collision issue.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, for turns 11 and 12, freeway y=1 is occupied, but I am on y=4 and y=5, not y=1, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly, no other issues.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 2 is occupied at turn 10, but I am not on it.\n\nSo I think this works.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: S  // for example, but at turn 16, action is taken, but y=9, so S is fine.\n\nSince the sequence includes up to a_{16}, and I need to specify.\n\nBut in the position, at turn 16, I am at y=9, and I take action, but the reaching is at turn 16.\n\nI could have a shorter sequence by not including the last action, but according to the problem, I must include actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nIn this case, H=7, actions from a_{10} to a_{16}.\n\nBut a_{16} doesn't affect the reaching, but I have to include it.\n\nTo save one turn, but I can't reach earlier.\n\nAnother way: I could go faster, but no.\n\nOr stay somewhere, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo minimal H=7.\n\nBut in the sequence, with a_{10} to a_{15} all U, and a_{16}=S.\n\nBut let's confirm the freeways.\n\nAt turn 11: I am on y=4 (since a_{10}=U, y_{11}=4)\n\nFreeway y=4, which is safe, as established.\n\nSimilarly, turn 12: y=5, safe.\n\nTurn 13: y=6, safe.\n\netc.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut in freeway 1, at turn 11 and 12, it is occupied, but I am not on it.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 10, freeway 2 occupied, but I am on y=3.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U from turn 10 to 15, and S at turn 16.\n\nBut turn 15 action: a_{15}=U, sets y_{16}=9\n\nThen at turn 16, a_{16}=S, sets y_{17}=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to write the actions.\n\nPerhaps I can have H=7 with actions a_{10} to a_{16}.\n\nBut a_{16} is after reaching.\n\nTo make it neat, I can have at turn 15, I am at y=8, and if I do S, y_{16}=8, not 9, so I must do U at turn 15 to reach y=9 at turn 16.\n\nThen at turn 16, I am at y=9, and I do S.\n\nBut in the sequence for H=7, it includes a_{16}.\n\nNow, for the output, it should be fine.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nIt should be:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nBut turn 16 is t_1 + H -1 =10+7-1=16, yes.\n\nt_1=10, H=7, t_1 + H -1=16.\n\nActions at turn 10 to 16.\n\nBut at turn 10 to 15, actions move to higher y, turn 16 action stays.\n\nNow, but in terms of the freeway at turn 16, y=9, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at turn 16 with only actions up to a_{15}, but then for H=6, turn t_1 + H -1=10+6-1=15, but at turn 15, I can be at y=8 max, not 9, so impossible.\n\nSo H=7 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 3 to 8 are all safe, so no need to change.\n\nBut let's double-check freeway 2.\n\nAt turn 10, freeway 2 occupied, but I am on y=3, not y=2.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly without issue.\n\nBut the player is at (0,y), and cars on freeways, but since y=3 to 8 always safe, I can go up.\n\nBut in the beginning, at turn 10, y=3 safe.\n\nAfter U, turn 11, y=4 safe, and so on.\n\nBut at turn 11, freeway y=1 occupied, but I am on y=4, not y=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nSo minimal H=7.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: S  (since at y=9, cannot go up, so stay)\n\nI could do D, but S is better.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut in the output, it should be in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is any constraint I missed.\n\nThe note about moving: if I move to different y, I am not on the new y until next turn.\n\nBut in this case, when I move from y=3 to y=4 at turn 10, during turn 10, I am on y=3, safe; at turn 11, on y=4, safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut the car on freeway 2 at turn 10, span [ -11,24], which includes 0, but since I am not on y=2, no collision.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7 with the sequence above.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 16, action S, but it's part of the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can have only 6 actions, but I need to reach at turn 15, impossible.\n\nSo H=7.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nSo in the box:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: S \\end{array} }\n\nBut turn numbers: 10 to 16.\n\nt_1=10, H=7, actions from t=0 to 6: a_{10} to a_{16}.\n\nYes.\n\nTo write it neatly.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 15, action U sets y_{16}=9, so at turn 16, position is 9.\n\nThen action at turn 16 is S, which is fine.\n\nI think that's the way.\n\nSo I believe this is the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 3) at turn 10. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\n### Analysis:\n- Freeways y=3 to y=8 are always safe at all turns because the cars on these freeways never occupy x=0. Specifically:\n  - The car with span [1, 12] at turn 10 moves right and always has x ≥ 1, so x=0 is never covered.\n  - The car with span [49, 60] at turn 10 moves right and always has x ≥ 49 > 0, so x=0 is never covered.\n- Freeway y=1 is occupied at x=0 at turns 11 and 12 (by one car) and turns 17 and 18 (by another car), but since the player is not on y=1 during these turns, it is not an issue.\n- Freeway y=2 is occupied at x=0 only at turn 10, but the player starts on y=3, so no collision occurs.\n- The player must increase y from 3 to 9, a difference of 6, requiring at least 6 up moves. Since each move changes y by at most 1, the earliest possible turn to reach y=9 is turn 16 (after 6 up moves from turn 10).\n\n### Sequence:\n- At turn 10, start at y=3 (safe). Move up (U) to reach y=4 at turn 11.\n- At turn 11, y=4 (safe). Move up (U) to reach y=5 at turn 12.\n- At turn 12, y=5 (safe). Move up (U) to reach y=6 at turn 13.\n- At turn 13, y=6 (safe). Move up (U) to reach y=7 at turn 14.\n- At turn 14, y=7 (safe). Move up (U) to reach y=8 at turn 15.\n- At turn 15, y=8 (safe). Move up (U) to reach y=9 at turn 16.\n- At turn 16, y=9 is reached. Since y=9 has no cars and is safe, the action can be stay (S) to remain at y=9.\n\nThis sequence takes 7 turns (from turn 10 to turn 16) and avoids all collisions:\n- Turns 10 to 15: Player is on freeways y=3 to y=8, which are always safe.\n- Turn 16: Player is at y=9, safe.\n\nNo shorter sequence is possible because reaching y=9 requires at least 6 up moves, and the earliest turn to achieve this is turn 16 (with H=7).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: S \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1=11, and I start at y=4.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the cars move. All cars are moving right, according to the table. The car update for right-moving cars is: at turn T, the span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], since for right-moving, initial span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume, but let's check the data.\n\nLooking at the car states:\n\nFor freeway 1: cars are (0, -11, right, 6), (-36, -47, right, 6), (42, 31, right, 6)\n\n(42,31)? That might be a typo. Head and tail, for right-moving, head should be greater than tail? Let's see the span: it says [τ, h] for right-moving, so h should be the front, so for (42,31), if it's (h,τ), then h=42, τ=31, so span [31,42] initially? But it says (42,31, right,6), so probably head=42, tail=31, so span [31,42].\n\nSimilarly, (0,-11) right: head=0, tail=-11, span [-11,0].\n\nAnd (-36,-47): head=-36, tail=-47, span [-47,-36].\n\nAll with speed 6.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways, but freeway 2 has only one car: (60,25,right,36) so head=60, tail=25, span [25,60] at t1=11.\n\nFreeways 3 to 8 all have the same cars: (18,7,right,6) and (-48,-59,right,6), so for each, span [7,18] and [-59,-48] at t1=11.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is at position (0, y_T) and for that freeway k=y_T, if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and I decide action to go to y_{T+1}. But at turn T, I am on y_T, so I check collision on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nThe note says: if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I don't collide with cars there until turn T+1 when I arrive.\n\nBut at turn T, I am on y_T, so I need to avoid collision on y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, I need to get to y=9, which is the top, and since y=0 to 9, y=9 is the goal, no freeway above, I assume.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think, since freeways are y=1 to 8 for cars.\n\nThe player starts at (0,4), so on freeway y=4? Position is (0,y), so at (0,4), that means on freeway y=4, I think, since freeways are vertical positions.\n\nFreeway k means y=k, I believe.\n\nSo at position (0,y_t), that means on freeway y_t.\n\nNow, the goal is to reach (0,9), which is not a freeway, so no cars there, so no collision issue at y=9.\n\nBut to reach there, I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nNow, the player moves vertically only, with actions U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\ny from 0 to 9, so if y=0 and I try to go down, it should stay 0, similarly y=9 and up, stay 9, I assume, since y_{t+1} in [0,9].\n\nBut in this case, starting from y=4, going to 9, so up mostly.\n\nBut I have to avoid the freeways when cars are at x=0.\n\nCollision when for the freeway I'm on at turn T, 0 is in the span of a car, meaning the car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nSo I need to ensure that when I am on a freeway y at turn t, for that freeway, at that turn, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nNow, since all cars move horizontally, and I move vertically, I need to find a path up to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, so when I reach y=9, I stop, I think, since it's the position.\n\nThe sequence should end when y=9.\n\nNow, minimal H, so shortest path in terms of turns.\n\nSince I start at y=4, need to go to y=9, that's 5 steps up, so minimum 5 turns if I go up continuously, but I might have to wait or detour if there are collisions.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the starting turn? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1 for actions, and position after H steps.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1 such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen position after these actions: after action at t1, position at t1+1; after action at t1+1, position at t1+2, and so on, up to after action at t1+H-1, position at t1+H.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1+H} = 9? Let's see.\n\nThe position at turn t is after the action? I think we need to define the turns.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, player is at position (0, y_t), I assume.\n\nThen during turn t, player chooses action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAnd at the same time, cars move to their positions for turn t, I think.\n\nThe collision is checked at turn T, meaning when player is at (0, y_T) for that turn.\n\nThe note says: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will not be considered on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nSo at turn T, player is on freeway y_T, and action a_t determines y_{T+1}.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the car spans at turn T on that freeway.\n\nThen, after action, player moves to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and we want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\ny_{t1+H} is the position after H actions, starting from y_{t1} at turn t1.\n\nAt turn t1, position is given as (0,4), so y_{t1} = 4.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} is set, and so on, up to after a_{t1+H-1}, y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nSo we need y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nAnd H is the number of actions, so it takes H turns to go from turn t1 to turn t1+H.\n\nThe minimal H such that we can reach y=9 in H steps.\n\nNow, since we start at y=4, to reach y=9, the minimum possible H is 5, by going up each time: U,U,U,U,U.\n\nBut we need to check if this is possible without collision.\n\nIf not, we might need to go down or stay sometimes, increasing H.\n\nFirst, let's check for each freeway and each turn if there is a car covering x=0.\n\nThe cars move with constant speed, so for a given freeway and car, the span at turn T (relative to t1=11) can be computed.\n\nSet τ = T - t1 = T - 11, the offset.\n\nFor a right-moving car with initial span [τ, h] at t1, at time T, span is [τ + sτ, h + sτ] where τ = T - t1.\n\nSince s is speed, and time in turns, s is distance per turn.\n\nFor example, freeway 1, cars:\n\nFirst car: (h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=6) so at t1, span [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt turn T, span [ -11 + 6*(T-11) , 0 + 6*(T-11) ] = [6(T-11) -11, 6(T-11)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (h=-36, τ=-47, s=6) span at t1 [ -47, -36]\n\nAt T: [ -47 + 6(T-11), -36 + 6(T-11) ]\n\nThird car: (h=42, τ=31, s=6) span at t1 [31,42]\n\nAt T: [31 + 6(T-11), 42 + 6(T-11)]\n\nNow, 0 is in span if min <= 0 <= max.\n\nFor first car: 6(T-11) -11 <= 0 <= 6(T-11)\n\nWhich means 6(T-11) -11 <= 0 and 0 <= 6(T-11)\n\nFrom 0 <= 6(T-11), T-11 >= 0, so T >= 11\n\nFrom 6(T-11) -11 <= 0, 6(T-11) <= 11, T-11 <= 11/6 ≈ 1.833, so T <= 11 + 1.833 = 12.833, so T <= 12 since T integer.\n\nT-11 <= 1.833, so T-11 <= 1 since integer? T-11 <= floor(11/6) but 11/6=1.833, so T-11 <= 1? Let's solve inequalities.\n\n6(T-11) <= 11 and T-11 >= 0\n\nSince T integer, T-11 = 0,1\n\nFor T-11=0: T=11, span [6*0 -11, 6*0] = [-11,0], so 0 is included? min=-11, max=0, so 0 is the max, so yes, 0 is in [-11,0], since closed interval, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, T-11=1: T=12, span [6*1 -11, 6*1] = [6-11,6] = [-5,6], 0 in between.\n\nT-11=2: T=13, span [12-11,12] = [1,12], 0 not >=1, so no.\n\nSo for first car, 0 in span at T=11 and T=12.\n\nBut at T=11, we are at turn t1, and we are on freeway, but we start at turn t1, position given, but do we check collision at turn t1?\n\nThe collision is checked when we are on the freeway at that turn.\n\nAt turn t1=11, we are at (0,4), so on freeway y=4.\n\nFor freeway 1, we are not on it, so no collision for us on freeway 1 at T=11.\n\nSimilarly, only when we are on that freeway.\n\nFor freeway 1, car 1 has 0 in span at T=11 and 12, but since we are on y=4 at T=11, not on y=1, so no issue.\n\nNow, for other freeways similarly.\n\nBut we need to see when we might be on each freeway.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway, at which turns there is a car covering x=0.\n\nThat is, for each k, and each car on k, find T such that 0 in Span(T) for that car.\n\nThen for freeway k, it is occupied at T if any car on k has 0 in span at T.\n\nThen we need that when we are on y_t = k at turn t, k is not occupied at that turn t.\n\nNow, for freeway k=1:\n\nCars:\n\nCar1: (0,-11,right,6): 0 in span at T=11,12 as above.\n\nCar2: (-36,-47,right,6): span at T: [ -47 +6(τ), -36 +6(τ) ] with τ=T-11\n\n0 in span if -47 +6τ <= 0 <= -36 +6τ\n\nSo -47 +6τ <= 0 => 6τ <= 47 => τ <= 47/6 ≈7.833, so τ<=7\n\nAnd 0 <= -36 +6τ => 6τ >= 36 => τ >= 6\n\nSo τ=6,7\n\nT-11=6,7 so T=17,18\n\nAt T=17, span: -47+6*6= -47+36= -11, -36+36=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=18: -47+42= -5, -36+42=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nT=19: -47+48=1, -36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nCar3: (42,31,right,6) span at T: [31 +6(τ), 42+6(τ)] with τ=T-11\n\nMin=31+6τ >=31>0 for τ>=0, so 0 never in span since min >=31>0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, occupied at T=11,12 (from car1), and T=17,18 (from car2)\n\nBut T=11 is now, we are not on it.\n\nNow freeway 2: only one car (60,25,right,36)\n\nSpan at t1: [25,60]\n\nAt T: [25 +36(τ), 60+36(τ)] with τ=T-11\n\nMin=25+36τ, for τ=0, min=25>0, so 0 never in span. Freeway 2 never occupied.\n\nMin=25+36τ >=25>0, yes, so no car covers x=0 on freeway 2 at any time.\n\nNow freeways 3 to 8 are all the same: two cars each: (18,7,right,6) and (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (18,7,right,6) span at t1 [7,18]\n\nAt T: [7 +6(τ), 18+6(τ)]\n\n0 in span if 7+6τ <= 0 <= 18+6τ\n\nBut 7+6τ <=0? 6τ <= -7, impossible since τ>=0, so 7+6τ >=7>0, so min>0, 0 never in span.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-48,-59,right,6) wait, head and tail: (h,τ) = (-48,-59)? For right-moving, initial span [τ,h] = [-59,-48] since τ=-59, h=-48.\n\nAt T: span [ -59 +6(τ), -48 +6(τ) ] with τ=T-11\n\n0 in span if -59 +6τ <= 0 <= -48 +6τ\n\nSo -59 +6τ <=0 => 6τ <=59 => τ <=59/6≈9.833, so τ<=9\n\nAnd 0 <= -48 +6τ => 6τ >=48 => τ>=8\n\nSo τ=8,9\n\nT-11=8,9 so T=19,20\n\nAt T=19, span: -59 +48= -11, -48 +48=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=20: -59+54= -5, -48+54=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nT=21: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for each of freeways 3 to 8, occupied only at T=19 and T=20.\n\nBut since all are identical, if we are on any of these freeways at T=19 or 20, we collide.\n\nNow, summary of occupied freeways:\n\n- Freeway 1: occupied at T=12,17,18\n\nT=11 and 12 from car1, but T=11 is past, so at future turns: T=12,17,18\n\n- Freeway 2: never occupied\n\n- Freeways 3-8: occupied at T=19,20\n\nNow, we start at turn t1=11, y=4.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe direct path: up 5 times to y=9 in 5 turns.\n\nActions at t=11,12,13,14,15 to positions y=5,6,7,8,9 at turns 12,13,14,15,16.\n\nLet's list the turns and positions:\n\nTurn t: position y_t (at start of turn)\n\nAction a_t determines y_{t+1}\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, and we choose a_t to go to y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision checked at turn t for position y_t on freeway y_t.\n\nFor the sequence:\n\nAt turn 11: y=4, we are on freeway 4, need to check if occupied at t=11.\n\nFreeway 4 is one of 3-8? Freeways 1 to 8, y=4 is freeway 4.\n\nAt t=11, is freeway 4 occupied?\n\nFrom above, freeways 3-8 occupied only at T=19,20, not at t=11.\n\nt=11 is now, and for freeway 4, at T=11, is there a car covering x=0?\n\nFor freeway 4, cars: (18,7,right,6) and (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nAt T=11, τ=0, span [7,18] and [-59,-48], both min >0 or max<0, so 0 not in span, so not occupied at t=11.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 never occupied, etc.\n\nIn the direct up path:\n\nStart turn 11: y=4, on freeway 4, not occupied, so safe.\n\nAction a_11: U, so y_{12} =5\n\nTurn 12: now at y=5, on freeway 5.\n\nIs freeway 5 occupied at t=12? Freeway 5 is y=5, which is one of 3-8? Freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8 are all same, occupied only at T=19,20.\n\nt=12 <19, so not occupied. Safe.\n\nAction a_12: U, y_{13}=6\n\nTurn 13: y=6, freeway 6, not occupied (T=13<19), safe.\n\na_13: U, y_{14}=7\n\nTurn 14: y=7, freeway 7, not occupied, safe.\n\na_14: U, y_{15}=8\n\nTurn 15: y=8, freeway 8, not occupied, safe.\n\na_15: U, y_{16}=9\n\nNow at turn 16, y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision, and we reached (0,9).\n\ny_{16} =9, and this is after action at turn 15.\n\nIn terms of turns: we have actions at t=11,12,13,14,15, that's 5 actions, H=5.\n\ny_{t1 + H} = y_{11+5} = y_{16} =9.\n\nAnd we were never on an occupied freeway during the turns.\n\nSpecifically, at turns 11 to 15, we were on y=4,5,6,7,8 respectively.\n\nFreeways occupied only at T=12,17,18 for y=1, and T=19,20 for y=3-8.\n\nWe were on y=4 at t=11: t=11 not in occupied times.\n\ny=5 at t=12: t=12, but y=5 is freeway 5, which is occupied only at t=19,20, not at t=12. t=12 is for freeway 1, but we are on y=5, not y=1.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut freeway 1 occupied at t=12, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly, at t=17,18, freeway 1 occupied, but we are at y=9 by then.\n\nAnd t=19,20, freeways 3-8 occupied, but we are at y=9.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, we can go directly up in 5 turns.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do at turn 16.\n\nBut let me confirm the turns.\n\nt1=11\n\nAfter action a11 at t=11, position at t=12 is y=5\n\n...\n\nAfter a15 at t=15, position at t=16 is y=9.\n\nAnd we need y_{t1 + H} =9, so t1 + H =16, H=5.\n\nActions from t=11 to t=15.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so for H=5, actions at t1 +0 to t1+4, i.e., t=11,12,13,14,15.\n\nThen y_{t1+5} = y_{16}=9.\n\nIn the collision, at each turn t, we are at y_t, which for t=11, y=4; t=12, y=5; etc., as above, all safe.\n\nBut at turn t=12, freeway 1 is occupied, but we are on freeway 5, not 1, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut is there any other constraint?\n\nThe cars: for freeway 1, at t=12, it is occupied, but we are not there.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2: only one car (60,25,right,36), span min=25+36τ >=25>0, so never covers x=0, so freeway 2 is always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 3-8 safe except t=19,20.\n\nBut we are not there at those times.\n\nIn the path, we go from y=4 to 5 at t=12, etc., up to y=8 at t=15, then to y=9 at t=16.\n\nAt t=15, we are on y=8, which is freeway 8, at t=15, which is before 19, so safe.\n\nThen move to y=9.\n\nSo H=5 should work.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 1, there is a car at t=12, but we are not on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I misread the freeway indices.\n\nFreeway k for y=k.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, etc.\n\nIn the initial position, (0,4), so on freeway 4.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 4, it has cars, but not covering x=0 at t=11.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let me check if at any point in the path, we might be on a freeway when occupied.\n\nFor example, if we were to go to freeway 1 at t=12, it would be occupied, but we are going up, not to y=1.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 5.\n\nBut is there a reason we cannot? Perhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother thing: the player update, y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y, with y in [0,9], so if at y=0, D keeps it 0, but here we start at 4, going up.\n\nNo problem.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 1 at t=12, but we avoid it.\n\nBut in this case, we don't even go near it.\n\nSo I think H=5 is possible.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nWe need to output the actions.\n\nBut the sequence should be for turns starting from t1.\n\nSo for turn t1=11: action\n\nThen turn t1+1=12: action\n\netc.\n\nIn this case, all actions U.\n\nBut let me confirm if at turn t=11, we need to take action.\n\nStart at turn t1=11, position given, then we take action a_{t1} to go to next position.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1.\n\nSo for H=5:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1} = U  (to go to y=5)\n\nIn the position, after a_{t1}, y_{t1+1}=5.\n\nThen turn t1+1: a_{t1+1} = U, to y=6\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t1+4: a_{t1+4} = U, to y=9 at t1+5.\n\nNow, y_{t1+5}=9.\n\nAnd H=5.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? From y=4 to y=9, minimum 5 up moves, so H=5 is minimum possible.\n\nSince we can do it, it should be fine.\n\nBut perhaps I misread the car positions.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 1, car1 at t=11, span [-11,0], which includes x=0, but at t=11, we are on y=4, not y=1, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps for the move: when we move, at the turn we are on the current freeway.\n\nBut in this case, all covered.\n\nPerhaps the goal is to reach (0,9), and y=9 is not a freeway, so when we are at y=9, no collision check, which is fine.\n\nSo I think it's okay.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 2: (60,25,right,36), at t1, span [25,60], all positive, moving right, so min increasing, never covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nFor freeways 3-8, the first car (18,7,right,6), min=7>0, so never covers x=0, only the second car at t=19,20.\n\nBut we are done by t=16.\n\nt=16 <19, so no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5 with all U actions.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nThen at turn 16, position (0,9).\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions for turns from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nH=5, so turns 11 to 15.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but in the answer format, it's the sequence, and H is implied.\n\nBut we need to output the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I should write it.\n\nBut is there any mistake?\n\nAnother point: in the car update, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the initial state, for freeway 1, cars given as (head, tail, dir, speed), e.g., (0,-11,right,6), so head=0, tail=-11, so for right-moving, span [τ,h] = [-11,0], which matches.\n\nSimilarly, (-36,-47,right,6), head=-36, tail=-47, span [-47,-36].\n\nAnd (42,31,right,6), head=42, tail=31, span [31,42].\n\nAll consistent.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, for freeway 2: (60,25,right,36), head=60, tail=25, span [25,60].\n\nAt T, [25+36τ, 60+36τ], always min>0.\n\nFreeways 3-8: (18,7,right,6), head=18, tail=7, span [7,18], min=7>0.\n\nAnd (-48,-59,right,6), head=-48, tail=-59, span [-59,-48], which at T, covers x=0 when τ=8,9 as computed.\n\nBut we are not on those freeways at t=19,20.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=5 at t=12, which is fine.\n\nt=12 is turn 12, not 19.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps the initial position: at turn t1=11, we are given position, and we take action immediately.\n\nCollision at turn t1: since we are at y=4, and freeway 4 not occupied, safe.\n\nThen move up, etc.\n\nSo I believe H=5 is possible and minimal.\n\nBut the problem might be tricky, or I missed something.\n\nAnother thing: the vertical axis y=0 to 9, and freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so when at y=0 or y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nIn this case, we end at y=9.\n\nNow, to be thorough, let's see if we can reach faster, but from y=4 to y=9, 5 steps is minimum, so no.\n\nIf we go down, it would take more turns, so worse.\n\nSo minimal H=5.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 5 turns.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 11: U \\\\ Turn 12: U \\\\ Turn 13: U \\\\ Turn 14: U \\\\ Turn 15: U }\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nThe turn labels should be as per the input.\n\nt1=11.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nAnd that should be it.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 1, at t=12, it is occupied, but we are not on it, so fine.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 5 at t=12, but freeway 5 is not occupied at t=12.\n\nOnly freeway 1 is occupied at t=12.\n\nBut we are on freeway 5.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nI think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The minimum vertical distance to cover is from \\(y = 4\\) to \\(y = 9\\), requiring at least 5 upward moves (U actions), so the theoretical minimum \\(H = 5\\).\n- Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) if the player is on freeway \\(y_T\\) and \\(x = 0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n- Car movements are deterministic based on their initial state at \\(t_1 = 11\\) and speed.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,5) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The current turn is t=12, and I start at y=5.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. Cars move left or right with constant speed, and their positions change linearly over time. For collision, it happens at turn T if I'm on a freeway y at that turn and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn. So if I move up from y to y+1 at turn T, I'm still on y at turn T, and on y+1 at turn T+1. Similarly for down.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9. Since y=9 is the top, and there are no cars above y=8, I think y=9 is safe; no freeway there, so no cars to collide with. The freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, I assume. y=0 is the bottom, and y=9 is the target.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so they should be safe positions.\n\nI start at y=5, and need to go to y=9, so I need to move up 4 units. Each up move increases y by 1, down by 1, stay keeps it. So minimum moves would be 4 up moves, but I might need to wait or move down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 4.\n\nBut I need to minimize H, so I should aim for as few turns as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states at turn t=12.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, there are cars with head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nDirection: right-moving means they go to increasing x, so for right, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, and it moves to [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h, τ] with h < τ? No, from the update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSo for left-moving, h and τ are such that at t1, head is h, tail is τ, and since it's left-moving, head is left or right? I think I need to interpret the coordinates.\n\nAssume x-axis horizontal, y vertical. Freeways are horizontal rows.\n\nFor a car, span is the segment it occupies.\n\nFor left-moving car, it moves left, so decreasing x. At time t, span [h, τ], meaning from x=h to x=τ, and since it moves left, at later time, positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: [τ, h], from x=τ to x=h, moves right, positions increase.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: cars (6, -5, right, 6), (-30, -41, right, 6), (48, 37, right, 6)\n\nFor right-moving, the span is given as (head, tail) but in the direction, it says right, so for right-moving, it should be [tail, head] with tail < head? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update rules: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt]\n\nAnd in the table, it's listed as (h, τ, d, s), so for the first car: (6, -5, right, 6)\n\nBut for right-moving, [τ, h] should have τ < h, but here h=6, τ=-5, and -5 < 6, so τ=-5, h=6, so span at t1 is [-5, 6]? But it says (head, tail), so I think head and tail are labeled, but for direction, we need to interpret.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's look at the update.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it says [τ, h] → [τ + s dt, h + s dt], so τ is the left end, h is the right end for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: [h, τ] → [h - s dt, τ - s dt], so h is the right end, τ is the left end? Let's see: [h, τ] to [h - s dt, τ - s dt], so if it moves left, h decreases, τ decreases, so at t1, x from h to τ, but since moving left, if h > τ, then it's decreasing, so span from high to low? I think it's better to think in terms of min and max x.\n\nI think the span is given with head and tail, but for collision, we care about whether 0 is in the interval [min x, max x] at time T.\n\nFor a car, at time T, the span is an interval, and if 0 is within that interval, and I'm on that freeway, collision.\n\nFor right-moving car, given (head, tail, dir, speed), with dir=right, the span at t1 is [min, max] = [tail, head] since tail should be left, head right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, dir=left, span at t1 is [head, tail] but since moving left, head is right, tail is left, so [tail, head] with tail < head? Not necessarily, from the update.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nFrom the update rule:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it moves left, h and τ both decrease, so the left end is decreasing.\n\nAt t1, the car occupies from x = min(h,τ) to max(h,τ), but from the notation, [h, τ] could be in any order? I think we need to interpret h and τ based on direction.\n\nTo simplify, for collision, we need the min and max x at time T.\n\nFor a car at t1 with (head, tail, dir, speed), at time T, the position is:\n\nIf dir = right, then at t1, left end = tail, right end = head, so min x = tail, max x = head.\n\nThen at T, min x(T) = tail + s (T-t1)\n\nmax x(T) = head + s (T-t1)\n\nSimilarly, if dir = left, at t1, min x = τ? From [h, τ] → [h - s dt, τ - s dt], so the values decrease, so min x at t1 is min(h,τ), max x is max(h,τ), but the update shifts both by -s dt.\n\nFor left-moving, if h and τ, with dir left, typically head is the front, so for left-moving, front is left, so at t1, x from head to tail, with head < tail if moving left? Let's assume that for left-moving, head is the left end, tail is right end, but the update says [h, τ] to [h - s dt, τ - s dt], so if h and τ, with moving left, h should be the right end or left?\n\nI think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll define for each car the min and max x at t1 from the given (head, tail, dir).\n\nThen at time T, min x(T) and max x(T) can be found.\n\nFor collision, at time T, for a car on freeway k, if min x(T) <= 0 <= max x(T), then car at position 0.\n\nNow for freeway 1, cars:\n\nFirst car: (6, -5, right, 6)\n\nDir right, so at t1=12, min x = tail = -5, max x = head = 6\n\nSpeed s=6, so at time T, min x(T) = -5 + 6*(T-12)\n\nmax x(T) = 6 + 6*(T-12)\n\nSecond car: (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nDir right, min x = tail = -41, max x = head = -30\n\nAt T, min x(T) = -41 + 6*(T-12)\n\nmax x(T) = -30 + 6*(T-12)\n\nThird car: (48, 37, right, 6) but (head, tail) = (48,37), dir right, so min x = tail =37, max x = head=48? But 37<48, so min=37, max=48.\n\nAt T, min x(T) = 37 + 6*(T-12)\n\nmax x(T) = 48 + 6*(T-12)\n\nBut all for freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nNow, for freeway 2: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nDir right, min x = tail = -83, max x = head = -48\n\nSpeed s=36, high speed.\n\nAt T, min x(T) = -83 + 36*(T-12)\n\nmax x(T) = -48 + 36*(T-12)\n\nFreeway 3 to 8 all have the same cars: (24,13,right,6) and (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nLet's list:\n\nFreeway 3: cars (24,13,right,6) and (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nFor (24,13,right,6): min x=13, max x=24 at t=12\n\nAt T, min x(T) =13 +6*(T-12), max x(T)=24 +6*(T-12)\n\nFor (-42,-53,right,6): min x= -53, max x= -42 at t=12\n\nAt T, min x(T)= -53 +6*(T-12), max x(T)= -42 +6*(T-12)\n\nSimilarly for freeways 4,5,6,7,8, all identical to freeway 3? The table says for each from 3 to 8, same cars: (24,13,right,6) and (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nYes, so freeways 3 through 8 have the same car configurations.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=5 to y=9. Since I start at y=5 at turn t=12.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn T >=12.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each time, when there is a car at x=0.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway k and time T, if there is a car on k such that min x(T) <= 0 <= max x(T).\n\nThen, if I am on that freeway at time T, I collide.\n\nSince I move at each turn, I need to ensure that for each turn T from t=12 onwards, when I am at y_T, which is the freeway row, that for that row, at time T, no car has 0 in its span.\n\ny from 1 to 8 are freeways, y=0 and y=9 are not, so no cars, always safe.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position (0, y_T), so if y_T between 1 and 8, I need that on freeway y_T, at time T, no car at x=0.\n\nIf y_T =0 or 9, no issue.\n\nNow, since the car positions change with time, I need to compute for each row and time when it is safe.\n\nFirst, let's list the times: let τ = T - 12, so time offset from current.\n\nAt τ=0, T=12.\n\nI start at y=5 at τ=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some τ.\n\nLet me denote the action at each step.\n\nSince I can move up, down, or stay, I need to choose a sequence of actions to change y.\n\nBut to minimize H, the number of turns, so I want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nMinimum H is 4, if I go up 4 times in a row.\n\nBut I need to check if that causes collision.\n\nFirst, if I go up from y=5 to y=6 at turn T=12? Let's see the sequence.\n\nAt turn T=12, I am at y=5.\n\nI perform action a_{12}, which determines y_{13}.\n\nThen at turn T=13, I am at y_{13}, and so on.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T, determined by the actions from previous turns.\n\nSpecifically, at turn t, I am at y_t, and I choose action a_t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t, I am on row y_t, and I need no collision on row y_t at time t.\n\nFor example, at t=12, I am on y=5, freeway 5, at time 12.\n\nI need to check if on freeway 5 at time 12, is there a car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, when I move, at turn t, I am on y_t, and after action, I go to y_{t+1}, but at turn t, I am still on y_t.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway k and time T, the collision status at x=0.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: cars as above.\n\nFor car 1: (6,-5,right,6) at t=12, min x= -5, max x=6, so at T=12, min x= -5, max x=6, so 0 is between -5 and 6, so yes, car at x=0 at T=12 for freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, at other times, min x(T) = -5 +6(τ), max x(T)=6 +6(τ) where τ=T-12.\n\n0 in [ -5+6τ, 6+6τ ] when -5+6τ <=0 and 0<=6+6τ.\n\nSince 6+6τ >0 always for τ>=0, so only need -5+6τ <=0, so 6τ <=5, τ <=5/6, so for τ=0 only? τ integer, T integer, so τ=0, T=12.\n\n-5+6τ <=0 implies 6τ <=5, τ <= 5/6, so for τ=0, -5<=0 true, τ=1, -5+6=1>0, so 0 not <= min when min>0? Let's see:\n\nmin x(T) = -5 +6τ\n\nmax x(T) =6 +6τ\n\n0 in [min, max] iff min <=0 and max>=0.\n\nAt τ=0, min=-5<=0, max=6>=0, true.\n\nAt τ=1, min=-5+6=1>0, so min>0, 0< min, not in [1,12], so no.\n\nSimilarly for τ>1, min larger, no.\n\nNow second car on freeway 1: (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nmin x= -41, max x= -30 at τ=0\n\nmin x(T)= -41 +6τ\n\nmax x(T)= -30 +6τ\n\n0 in [min,max] iff -41+6τ <=0 and -30+6τ >=0\n\n-41+6τ <=0 => 6τ <=41, τ <=41/6≈6.833, so τ<=6\n\n-30+6τ >=0 => 6τ>=30, τ>=5\n\nSo for τ=5,6\n\nAt τ=5, min= -41+30= -11, max= -30+30=0, so [ -11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt τ=6, min= -41+36= -5, max= -30+36=6, [ -5,6], 0 included.\n\nτ=7: min= -41+42=1>0, max= -30+42=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=17 and 18 (since τ=5, T=17; τ=6,T=18)\n\nT=12+τ, so τ=5, T=17; τ=6,T=18.\n\nBut this is for freeway 1.\n\nThird car: (48,37,right,6) min=37, max=48 at τ=0, both positive, min x(T)=37+6τ >0 for all τ>=0, so 0 never in span, since min>0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, at x=0 collision at times:\n\nFrom car1: only at T=12\n\nFrom car2: at T=17 and T=18\n\nT=12: car1 present\n\nT=17: car2 present? At T=17, τ=5, min=-11, max=0, so 0<= max=0, so yes, 0 in [ -11,0]\n\nSimilarly T=18: min=-5,max=6, 0 in.\n\nSo collision on freeway 1 at T=12,17,18.\n\nNow freeway 2: only one car (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nmin x= -83, max x= -48 at τ=0\n\nmin x(T)= -83 +36τ\n\nmax x(T)= -48 +36τ\n\n0 in [min,max] iff -83+36τ <=0 and -48+36τ >=0\n\n-83+36τ <=0 => 36τ <=83, τ <=83/36≈2.305, so τ<=2\n\n-48+36τ >=0 => 36τ>=48, τ>=48/36=4/3≈1.333, so τ>=2 since τ integer? τ integer.\n\nτ>= ceil(4/3)=2? 36τ>=48, τ>=48/36=4/3=1.333, so τ>=2\n\nτ<= floor(83/36)=83/36=2.305, so τ<=2\n\nSo τ=2 only.\n\nAt τ=2, min= -83 +72= -11, max= -48 +72=24, [ -11,24], 0 in.\n\nAt τ=1, min= -83+36= -47<0, max= -48+36= -12<0, so max<0, 0 not in [ -47,-12]\n\nAt τ=3, min= -83+108=25>0, max= -48+108=60>0, min>0, not in.\n\nSo only at τ=2, T=14, collision on freeway 2.\n\nNow freeways 3 to 8 all same, so let's take freeway k, 3<=k<=8.\n\nCars: (24,13,right,6) and (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,6), min x=13, max x=24 at τ=0\n\nmin x(T)=13 +6τ\n\nmax x(T)=24 +6τ\n\nSince min>0 for all τ>=0, 0 not in span, no collision from this car.\n\nSecond car: (-42,-53,right,6), min x= -53, max x= -42 at τ=0\n\nmin x(T)= -53 +6τ\n\nmax x(T)= -42 +6τ\n\n0 in [min,max] iff -53+6τ <=0 and -42+6τ >=0\n\n-53+6τ <=0 => 6τ <=53, τ <=53/6≈8.833, so τ<=8\n\n-42+6τ >=0 => 6τ>=42, τ>=7\n\nSo for τ=7,8\n\nAt τ=7, min= -53+42= -11, max= -42+42=0, [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\nAt τ=8, min= -53+48= -5, max= -42+48=6, [ -5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt τ=9, min= -53+54=1>0, max= -42+54=12>0, not in.\n\nSo collision on each freeway k=3 to8 at T=12+7=19 and T=12+8=20.\n\nT=19 and 20.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, times when unsafe (collision at x=0):\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=12,17,18\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=14\n\nFreeway 3 to 8: unsafe at T=19,20\n\nAll other times should be safe for each freeway, since only those cars and times.\n\nFor example, freeway 1 at other times, no car at x=0, similarly others.\n\nNow, I start at y=5 at T=12.\n\ny=5 is freeway 5, which is one of 3-8, so freeway 5.\n\nAt T=12, freeway 5: from above, for k=5, unsafe only at T=19,20? But T=12, is it safe?\n\nFor freeway 5 at T=12: from above, unsafe only at T=19,20, so at T=12, it should be safe, because no car at x=0 at that time.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 1 at T=12, unsafe, but I'm not on freeway 1.\n\nAt T=12, I am on y=5, freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5: cars same as freeway 3, etc.\n\nAt T=12, τ=0, for car (24,13,right,6), min=13>0, no.\n\nCar (-42,-53,right,6), min=-53, max=-42, both <0, so 0 not in [ -53,-42], so safe.\n\nSimilarly, only unsafe at T=19,20 for freeway 5.\n\nSimilarly for all rows.\n\nNow, let's list for each row and time, safe or not.\n\nSince rows 3-8 are identical, same safety.\n\nBut row 1,2 different.\n\nAlso, row 0 and 9 always safe.\n\nTimes: T from 12 onwards.\n\nFor row 1: unsafe at T=12,17,18\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nRow 2: unsafe at T=14\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nRow 3 to 8: unsafe at T=19,20\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nRow 0 and 9: always safe.\n\nI start at T=12, y=5.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nEach action: U, D, S, changing y by +1,-1,0.\n\nI start at y=5 at T=12.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some T.\n\nSince y=9 is safe always, I just need to arrive there.\n\nBut during the path, I must be safe at each position.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns to reach.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=12 to t=12+H-1, and at turn t=12+H-1, I am at (0,9).\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=12 to t=12+H-1.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, and after action, I set y_{t+1}.\n\nFor example, at T=12, I am at y=5, and it is safe, as we said.\n\nI choose action a_{12}, which will determine y_{13}.\n\nThen at T=13, I am at y_{13}, which must be safe, and so on.\n\nI need to go from y=5 to y=9, which is +4 in y.\n\nWith actions, each U increases y by 1, but I might need to wait or detour to avoid unsafe times on certain rows.\n\nBut since I want minimal H, I should avoid waiting if possible.\n\nFirst, can I go directly up in 4 steps?\n\nStart at T=12, y=5, safe.\n\nAction a_{12}: if I go U, then y_{13} =6.\n\nThen at T=13, I am at y=6.\n\nIs y=6 safe at T=13? y=6 is freeway 6, one of 3-8, unsafe only at T=19,20, so at T=13, safe.\n\nThen action a_{13}: U, y_{14}=7.\n\nAt T=14, y=7, freeway 7, unsafe only at 19,20, so safe at T=14.\n\nBut row 2 is unsafe at T=14, but I'm on row 7, not row 2.\n\nAction a_{14}: U, y_{15}=8.\n\nAt T=15, y=8, freeway 8, unsafe at 19,20, safe now.\n\nAction a_{15}: U, y_{16}=9.\n\nNow at T=16, I am at y=9, which is safe, and I have reached (0,9).\n\nIs that correct?\n\nAt T=15, after action U, y_{16}=9.\n\nThen at turn T=16, I am at y=9.\n\nAnd y=9 is safe.\n\nNow, what about the actions: from T=12 to T=15, I did U each time.\n\nActions at t=12,13,14,15.\n\nAt t=12: action U, go to y=6 at t=13? Let's list the turns.\n\nTurn T: position y_T, action a_T.\n\nAt T=12: y=5, choose a_{12}\n\nIf a_{12}=U, then y_{13} = 5+1=6\n\nAt T=13: y=6, choose a_{13}\n\nIf a_{13}=U, y_{14}=7\n\nAt T=14: y=7, choose a_{14}\n\nIf a_{14}=U, y_{15}=8\n\nAt T=15: y=8, choose a_{15}\n\nIf a_{15}=U, y_{16}=9\n\nAt T=16: y=9, which is the goal, so I have reached at T=16.\n\nH is the number of turns? From the problem: sequence of actions from t= t1 to t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H-1, position is (0,9).\n\nt1=12, so actions from t=12 to t=12+H-1.\n\nAt turn t=12+H-1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, if I start actions at t=12, and after H actions, I reach at turn t=12+H-1? Let's see.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn 12, position y=5.\n\nAfter 1 action (at t=12), at turn 13, position y_{13}.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 12+k, position y_{12+k}.\n\nI need y_{12+H-1} =9? From above: after H actions, I am at turn 12 + H.\n\nAt turn t, after actions from t1 to t-1, I am at y_t.\n\nSpecifically, at turn t1=12, I am at y_{12}=5.\n\nAfter choosing a_{12}, I go to y_{13}.\n\nAfter a_{13}, y_{14}, and so on.\n\nAfter choosing a_{t1 + H-1}, I go to y_{t1 + H}.\n\nI need to be at (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1? Let's read.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nFrom the problem: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nReaching at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nIn the action sequence, actions from t= t1 to t1 + H -1, total H actions.\n\nAfter these actions, at turn t1 + H, I am at y_{t1 + H}, but I need to be at (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nI need y_{t1 + H -1} = 9.\n\nFor example, at turn t1 + H -1, I am at (0,9).\n\nIn terms of the actions: at turn t1, I am at y_{t1}.\n\nI choose a_{t1}, which sets y_{t1+1}, and so on, up to a_{t1 + H -2}, which sets y_{t1 + H -1}, and a_{t1 + H -1} sets y_{t1 + H}, but I don't care about that if I reached at t1+H-1.\n\nSince I reach at turn t1+H-1, I don't need to perform action at that turn for moving, but I do perform an action to be at that position? No.\n\nThe position at turn t is determined before action at t.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position (0,y_t), then I choose action a_t, which moves me to (0,y_{t+1}) for the next turn.\n\nBut at turn t, I am at (0,y_t), and that's when I need to not collide, and when I reach (0,9) at some turn.\n\nIn this case, to be at (0,9) at turn T, for some T.\n\nThen H = T - t1 + 1? Let's see.\n\nt1=12, if I reach at turn T, then the number of turns from start to reach is T - 12, but H is the number of actions.\n\nFrom the sequence: actions from t= t1 to t1 + H -1, and reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nSo for example, if I reach at turn t1, that is T=t1, then H-1=0? Actions from t=t1 to t1-1? Inconsistency.\n\nt starts from 0 in the index.\n\n{ a_{t1 + t} }_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t=0, action at t1, t=1, action at t1+1, ..., t=H-1, action at t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter performing these H actions, the position at turn t1 + H should be set, but I need to be at (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, I am at position y_{t1 + H -1}, and I perform action a_{t1 + H -1}, which sets y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut for reaching, I need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd at that turn, I don't necessarily perform an action that moves, but I do perform an action.\n\nIn the minimal path, I can choose actions to be there.\n\nIn my earlier plan, I want to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nWith direct up: start at T=12, y=5.\n\nAfter action U at T=12, go to y=6 at T=13.\n\nAt T=13, y=6.\n\nAction U at T=13, go to y=7 at T=14.\n\nAt T=14, y=7.\n\nAction U at T=14, go to y=8 at T=15.\n\nAt T=15, y=8.\n\nAction U at T=15, go to y=9 at T=16.\n\nAt T=16, y=9, which is the goal, so I need to be at (0,9) at turn T=16.\n\nThen t1 + H -1 =16, t1=12, so 12 + H -1 =16, thus H-1=4, H=5.\n\nActions from t=12 to t=12+H-1=16? t=12 to t=16, but t=16 is t1+H-1? t1+H-1=16.\n\nActions: a_{12}, a_{13}, a_{14}, a_{15}, a_{16}? But at T=16, if I am already at y=9, and I perform action, it might move me away, but I need to be at y=9 at T=16, so I should not move or something.\n\nAt turn T=16, I am at y=9, and I need to be there at that turn. Then, if I perform action, it sets y_{17}, but since I have reached, I can choose S or something, but the position at T=16 is before the action.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T is fixed before action.\n\nI perform action a_T, which sets y_{T+1}.\n\nTo be at (0,9) at turn T, I need y_T =9.\n\nThen for that, the actions before determine y_T.\n\nIn the sequence, with actions from t=12 to t=15: a_{12}=U, a_{13}=U, a_{14}=U, a_{15}=U.\n\nThen y_{13}=6, y_{14}=7, y_{15}=8, y_{16}=9.\n\nSo at T=16, y=9.\n\nThus reached at turn 16.\n\nH: actions from t=12 to t=12+H-1, and reach at t=12+H-1.\n\nSo 12+H-1=16, thus H-1=4, H=5.\n\nActions: a_{12}, a_{13}, a_{14}, a_{15} — that's 4 actions? t from 12 to 15 inclusive is 4 actions: 12,13,14,15.\n\nThen at turn 16, position is set to 9.\n\nReached at turn 16 = t1 + H -1? t1=12, H=5, 12+5-1=16, yes.\n\nNumber of actions H=5.\n\nBut in terms of turns, from start to reach, it takes 4 steps: from t=12 to t=16, 4 turns later? At t=12 start, after 4 actions, at t=16.\n\nBut H=5 includes the actions.\n\nNow, in this path, I need to check safety at each position.\n\nAt T=12: y=5, freeway 5, safe as we said.\n\nAt T=13: y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nAt T=14: y=7, freeway 7, safe.\n\nAt T=15: y=8, freeway 8, safe.\n\nAt T=16: y=9, safe.\n\nAll safe, since unsafe times are later.\n\nT=17,18 for row1, but I'm not on row1.\n\nT=19,20 for rows 3-8, but at T=16 I'm at y=9, not on those rows.\n\nSo this path seems safe with H=5.\n\nBut is H=5 minimal?\n\nH is the number of actions to reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nMinimal H: since I need to increase y by 4, each up move increases by 1, so minimum 4 up moves, which would take me to y=9 at turn t1+4.\n\nFor example, if I start at t=12, y=5.\n\nAfter one U, at t=13, y=6\n\nAfter two U, at t=14, y=7\n\nAfter three U, at t=15, y=8\n\nAfter four U, at t=16, y=9\n\nSo at turn t=16, y=9, with 4 actions: a12 to a15.\n\nThen H=4, reach at turn t1+H-1=12+4-1=15? t1+H-1=12+4-1=15.\n\nBut at turn 15, y=8, not 9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nWith 4 actions: actions at t=12,13,14,15.\n\nAfter a12: y13=6\n\nAfter a13: y14=7\n\nAfter a14: y15=8\n\nAfter a15: y16=9\n\nSo position at turn t=16 is y=9.\n\nBut the reach time is at turn t=16.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=t1 to t1+H-1, with H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, the position at turn t1+H is set, but we need position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\nIn this case, with H=4 actions: a12,a13,a14,a15, position at turn t1+H-1 = t1+4-1 = t1+3.\n\nt1=12, turn 15, position y15=8, not 9.\n\nPosition at turn 16 is y16=9, but turn 16 is after the last action.\n\nTo have position at turn T= t1+H-1 =9.\n\nFor example, if I reach at turn 15, y15=9.\n\nThen I need to be at y=9 at turn 15.\n\nFrom start y=5 at turn 12.\n\nIn 3 actions, I can go to y=8 at turn 15, but not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 15, I need to have moved up 4 times in 3 turns? Impossible, since each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nFrom turn 12 to turn 15, there are 3 actions: a12,a13,a14, setting y13,y14,y15.\n\ny13 = y12 + Δy12\n\ny14 = y13 + Δy13\n\ny15 = y14 + Δy14\n\ny15 = y12 + Δy12 + Δy13 + Δy14\n\ny12=5, y15=9, so Δy12 + Δy13 + Δy14 =4.\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1, so possible only if all three are +1, then y15=5+1+1+1=8, which is 8, not 9.\n\nIf I use four actions, but with four actions, I can reach y=9 at turn 16.\n\nThe minimal H: since I start at y=5, need to be at y=9, difference 4, so I need at least 4 up moves, and since each move takes one turn, the earliest I can be at y=9 is turn 16, with y16=9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn T, T must be at least 16.\n\nBecause at turn 12, y=5; after one move, turn 13, y<=6; turn 14, y<=7; turn 15, y<=8; turn 16, y<=9.\n\nSo minimum reach at turn 16.\n\nThus minimal H such that t1+H-1=16, so 12+H-1=16, H=5.\n\nWith H=5 actions: a12 to a16, but at turn t1+H-1=16, y16=9.\n\nThen actions a12 to a16 set y13 to y17, but we need y16=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=12 to t=16 for H=5.\n\nBut at turn 16, I perform action a16, but since I am at y=9, I can choose S to stay, or whatever, but the position at turn 16 is y16, which is already 9 before the action.\n\nIn the path I described, with a12=U, a13=U, a14=U, a15=U, then y16=9.\n\nThen at turn 16, I am at y=9, so I have reached.\n\nNow, I need to specify a16? But the action sequence is up to a_{t1+H-1}, which is a16 for H=5.\n\nBut at that turn, I am already at the goal, so I can choose S, for example.\n\nBut the position is already 9 at turn 16, regardless of a16.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, I need to include a16, which can be S.\n\nIn the answer format, I need to list actions from t=12 to t=12+H-1.\n\nFor H=5, t=12 to 16.\n\nIn my path, a12=U, a13=U, a14=U, a15=U, and for a16, since I am at y=9, I can set a16=S, but it doesn't affect the position, but I need to specify.\n\nBut at turn 16, after reaching, the action might not be needed, but to be consistent, I can set a16=S.\n\nBut in this case, with the four U actions, I reach at turn 16, and a16 can be anything, but to minimize actions, perhaps I can have H=4? But with H=4, I can only reach y=8 at turn 15, not 9.\n\nt1+H-1=12+4-1=15, y15=8 if I move up, not 9.\n\nSo I must have H=5 to be at y=9 at turn 16.\n\nNow, in my direct path, it seems safe, but let me confirm the safety at each point.\n\nT=12: y=5, row 5, safe.\n\nT=13: y=6, row 6, safe.\n\nT=14: y=7, row 7, safe.\n\nT=15: y=8, row 8, safe? Row 8 unsafe at T=19,20, but T=15 is fine.\n\nT=16: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier? Turn 16 is earliest possible.\n\nPerhaps with waiting or down, but that would take more turns, so H larger, not minimal.\n\nFor example, if I go down to avoid something, but in this case no need.\n\nBut in the car states, is there any issue at T=14 or something?\n\nIn my path, I am not on row 2 at T=14, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly, row 1 at T=12,17,18, I'm not on it.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on row 2 at T=14.\n\nFreeway 2 unsafe at T=14, but I am on row 7 at that time, so fine.\n\nNow, the action sequence: for H=5, actions at t=12,13,14,15,16.\n\na12=U, a13=U, a14=U, a15=U, and a16=?\n\nAt t=16, I am at y=9, and I need to perform action, but since I have reached, I can choose S.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to specify.\n\nPerhaps I can have only four actions, but that would reach at turn 16 with H=4? No.\n\nAnother way: if I start by staying or something, but that would delay.\n\nFor example, if at t=12, I do S, then y13=5, same position, then I need to move later, so I reach later, say turn 17 or later, H larger.\n\nSo not minimal.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=5 with four U and one S at the end or something.\n\nBut with four U actions: a12 U, a13 U, a14 U, a15 U, then y16=9, reached at turn 16.\n\nNow for the action at t=16, since I need to include it in the sequence for H=5, I set a16=S.\n\nBut the position is already reached before a16.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=12 to t=16, five actions.\n\nPerhaps I can have a15 such that I reach at turn 15, but impossible, as y15 <=8.\n\nUnless I start from higher, but I start from 5.\n\ny=5 at t=12.\n\nMinimal to y=9 at t=16.\n\nSo I think H=5 is minimal.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 1 at T=12, but I'm not on it.\n\nBut let me confirm if at T=12, on row 5, is it safe.\n\nFreeway 5: cars (24,13,right,6) and (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nAt T=12, τ=0\n\nCar1: min=13, max=24, both >0, 0 not in.\n\nCar2: min=-53, max=-42, both <0, 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly at other times.\n\nBut for row 1 at T=12, unsafe, but I'm not there.\n\nSo the path seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut H=5, actions:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: S  (since at y=9, stay)\n\nBut at turn 16, after a16=S, y17=9, but we don't care.\n\nPosition at turn 16 is y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to list from t=12 to t=12+H-1=16.\n\nPerhaps I can set a16 to U, but y=9, U would go to 10, but y=10 not exist, probably not allowed, or capped at 9.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y in [0,9], so if at y=9, U does nothing? Or stays.\n\nThe condition: y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if y_t=9, and U, y_{t+1} = min(9,9+1)=9? Or exactly 9.\n\nThe equation says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if at y=9 and U, y_{t+1} =10 not in [0,9], so probably it is capped, or not allowed, but in the text: \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\", so I think it is set to 9 if out of bound.\n\nSimilarly for D at y=0.\n\nSo at y=9, U will keep y=9.\n\nSimilarly, S keeps y=9.\n\nSo in the sequence, at t=16, I can set U or S, both fine, but S is clearer.\n\nNow, but in the output, I need to list for each turn.\n\nBut let me see if there is any reason I cannot take this path.\n\nAt T=14, I am on y=7, but row 2 is unsafe, but I'm on 7, fine.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, for example, from y=5 to y=6 at turn t=12, action U.\n\nAt turn t=12, I am on y=5, perform U, so at turn t=12, I am on y=5, and moving to y=6 for next turn.\n\nBut collision is only at the current turn position.\n\nThe note says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so if on y_{T+1} at time T, cars there don't affect you.\n\nBut in this case, since I am on y_T at turn T, and moving, but the collision is only based on current position at that turn.\n\nIn my path, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster, but impossible.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway 2 at T=14.\n\nFreeway 2: car (-48,-83,right,36), at T=14, τ=2, min x= -83 + 36*2 = -83+72= -11, max x= -48+72=24, so [ -11,24], 0 in, so unsafe.\n\nBut I am not on row 2 at T=14, I am on row 7.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut in the freeways 3-8, at T=19,20 unsafe, but I am at y=9 before that.\n\nSo H=5 with actions U,U,U,U,S for t=12 to 16.\n\nBut the sequence should be for t=12 to t=12+H-1=16.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but in the context, H is the number of actions, I think.\n\nIn the task: \"minimal number of turns H\", but in the sequence, it says \"turns\" but it refers to the actions.\n\nI think H is the length of the action sequence.\n\nAnd reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nWith H=5, reach at turn 16.\n\nPerhaps I can have H=4, but reach at turn 15 with y=9, impossible.\n\nSo.\n\nBut let me see the car states again.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 1, there is a car at T=12, but I'm not there.\n\nBut at T=12, I am on y=5, which is safe.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 1, cars are given, but I need to make sure about the direction.\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so I think fine.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to avoid something, but no need.\n\nSo I think the minimal H is 5.\n\nBut let me confirm if at some point I must avoid.\n\nFor example, suppose I want to go directly, but at T=14, if I were on row 2, it would be unsafe, but I'm not.\n\nSimilarly, no conflict.\n\nPerhaps I can reach with H=5 but different actions, but same.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nBut at turn 16, action S is not necessary, but to complete the sequence.\n\nSince the position is reached at turn 16, and action at turn 16 sets y17, but we don't care, so S is fine.\n\nI could omit, but the sequence must have H actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed.\n\nPerhaps for the last action, since I am at y=9, I can choose anything, but S is safe.\n\nNow, but in the output, I need to box it.\n\nBut let me see if there is a shorter path? No.\n\nPerhaps with down move, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=4 at some point, then I need to go up more, so H larger.\n\nSo not minimal.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=5 with the sequence above.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 2, at T=14 unsafe, but I'm not on it.\n\nAnother thing: the player position is at x=0 always, I think.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me write the answer.\n\nH=5\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 16, since I am at y=9, and I set S, but the position at turn 16 is before action, so y=9.\n\nIf I set U, y17=9, same.\n\nBut S is better.\n\nNow, in the format.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,5), and I go to (0,9).\n\nNow, I think that's it.\n\nBut the problem has freeway 1 with multiple cars, but I didn't use row 1 or 2.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nPerhaps I should check if at T=17 or 18, but I am at y=9.\n\nSo.\n\nI think minimal H is 5.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn 12: a_{12}\n\nTurn 13: a_{13}\n\n...\n\n}\n\nWith actions.\n\nSo for this:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nBut H=5, turns from 12 to 16.\n\nPerhaps I can have only up to turn 15, but with H=4, I cannot reach y=9 at turn 15.\n\ny15=8 max.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) is 5. This is achieved with a sequence of actions that moves the player directly upward from \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 9\\) in 4 steps, with a final \"stay\" action at the goal position to complete the sequence.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- At turn 12, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 6\\) at turn 13.\n- At turn 13, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 7\\) at turn 14.\n- At turn 14, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 15.\n- At turn 15, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 16.\n- At turn 16, stay (S) since the player is already at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence avoids all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\):\n- At turn 12, the player is on freeway 5 at \\((0, 5)\\), which is safe (no car at \\(x=0\\)).\n- At turn 13, the player is on freeway 6 at \\((0, 6)\\), which is safe.\n- At turn 14, the player is on freeway 7 at \\((0, 7)\\), which is safe (freeway 2 is unsafe at this turn, but the player is not on it).\n- At turn 15, the player is on freeway 8 at \\((0, 8)\\), which is safe.\n- At turn 16, the player is at \\((0, 9)\\), which is not a freeway and always safe.\n\nThe unsafe times for the freeways are:\n- Freeway 1: unsafe at turns 12, 17, 18.\n- Freeway 2: unsafe at turn 14.\n- Freeways 3-8: unsafe at turns 19, 20.\n\nSince the player is not on any unsafe freeway at the unsafe times, no collision occurs. Reaching \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 16 is the earliest possible, as it requires at least 4 upward moves from \\(y = 5\\), and each move takes one turn.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For collision, it happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of some car at that turn. The note says that when you move to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn, so you only check the freeway you're currently on for collision.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t1=13, and for future turns, we compute the span based on the speed and direction.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car positions at t1=13 for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: three cars: (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6). All moving right at speed 6.\n\nSince they're moving right, span at time t is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)], because for right-moving, initial span [τ, h] becomes [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] where ΔT = T - t1.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right-moving.\n\nIn the update: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, head is larger, I think? Let's see the values.\n\nFor freeway 1, first car: head=12, tail=1, both positive, head>tail, moving right, so at t1, span is [1,12] I think? But the notation says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, head is the front, so if moving right, head should be on the right, so if x increases to the right, head has larger x.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, it's [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume.\n\nIn the first car: h=12, τ=1, so τ=1, h=12, so span [1,12] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=-24? That can't be right. Head h=-24, tail τ=-35, so τ=-35, h=-24, so since τ < h, it's moving right, span [-35,-24] at t1.\n\nThird car: h=54, τ=43, τ=43, h=54, span [43,54] at t1.\n\nAll with speed 6.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nBut freeway 1 has three cars, but freeways 2 to 8 have fewer or different.\n\nFreeway 2: only one car: (-12,-47,right,36) so h=-12, τ=-47, so τ=-47, h=-12, span [-47,-12] at t1, moving right at speed 36.\n\nFreeway 3 to 8 all have the same: (30,19,right,6) and (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nFor freeway 3: first car h=30, τ=19, so span [19,30] at t1.\n\nSecond car h=-36, τ=-47, span [-47,-36] at t1? τ=-47, h=-36, so since τ < h, span [τ,h] = [-47,-36].\n\nMoving right, speed 6.\n\nSimilarly for freeways 4,5,6,7,8 all identical to freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 1 has different cars, freeway 2 has one car, freeways 3-8 have two cars each.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=6 at turn t1=13.\n\nI need to get to y=9, so I need to go up three times, but I might need to wait or something to avoid cars.\n\nSince moving up or down changes y immediately, and collision is checked at each turn based on the current y and the cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that when you are on a freeway at turn T, you collide if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAnd 0 is the x-position, I assume, since the player is at (0,y), so when y=k, we check if x=0 is covered by a car on freeway k at that turn.\n\nThe player is always at x=0, so we need that for the freeway we are on, at that turn, no car has span containing 0.\n\nAlso, from the note, when you move, you are not on the new freeway until the next turn, so at turn T, when you choose action, you move to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, you are still on y_T, and collision is checked based on y_T.\n\nLet's read the collision part carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut since you're on y_T at turn T, you only care about cars on y_T at turn T for collision.\n\nThe note is emphasizing that you don't check the new freeway until you are on it.\n\nFor example, if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you are on y, so check cars on y at T. At turn T+1, you are on y+1, so check cars on y+1 at T+1.\n\nAnd if on y at T, if 0 is covered, you collide, regardless of future.\n\nSimilarly for staying or moving down.\n\nNow, the goal is to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, no cars.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\", so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=6, which is a freeway, so at turn t1, if there is a car on y=6 at that position, we might collide immediately, but let's check.\n\nFirst, at turn t1=13, player is at y=6.\n\nFreeway 6 is one of the freeways with cars like freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 6 has cars: (30,19,right,6) and (-36,-47,right,6) at t1=13.\n\nSo span at t1: first car [19,30], second car [-47,-36].\n\n0 is not in [19,30] nor in [-47,-36], since 0 < 19 and 0 > -36? -36 < 0 < -47? No, -47 < -36 < 0, so 0 is greater than -36, not in the interval. [ -47, -36] is from -47 to -36, all negative, so 0 not in it. Similarly [19,30] all positive, 0 not in. So at t1, on y=6, no collision, good.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9. Since y=8 is the last freeway, and y=9 is safe.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should go up as much as possible, but I have to avoid being on a freeway when a car covers x=0.\n\nSince going up takes at least 3 turns (from 6 to 7,7 to8,8 to9), but I might need to stay or move down to avoid, which would increase turns.\n\nBut since I want minimal turns, I should only go up or stay, not down, because down would make me take more turns to reach 9.\n\nUnless down is necessary to avoid, but since I start at 6 and need to go to 9, and freeways below might be worse, probably going up directly is best, but I need to check if it's possible without collision.\n\nI should simulate the car movements over time.\n\nFirst, let's define the time from t1=13.\n\nSet τ = T - t1, so at τ=0, T=13.\n\nWe need to find for each freeway and each τ, whether at time T=13+τ, x=0 is covered by any car on that freeway.\n\nIf covered, then if player is on that freeway at that turn, collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nFor each freeway k, and for each car, we can compute when 0 is in the span.\n\nSince the cars move linearly, we can find the time intervals when 0 is covered for each car.\n\nThen for each freeway, the union of those intervals is when it is dangerous to be on that freeway.\n\nThen, the player must not be on freeway k at time T when it is dangerous for k at T.\n\nNow, since the player moves step by step, we need to find a path from y=6 at τ=0 to y=9 at some τ=H-1, with actions at each step.\n\nτ is the offset, so at turn T, the time from start is τ = T - t1.\n\nAt τ=0, position y=6.\n\nAfter action at τ=0, we go to y at τ=1, and so on.\n\nLet me denote the state at time τ, after action.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think of the turn sequence.\n\nAt each turn T (from t1 onwards), we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe position y_t is for turn t.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, and we choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t, we check collision based on y_t and the cars at time t.\n\nFor time t, we need the car positions at time t.\n\nt here is absolute turn number.\n\nSet t1 = 13.\n\nSo for time t ≥ 13, we need car spans at t.\n\nFor a car, given at t1=13, span [τ, h] for right-moving, or [h, τ] for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving, so only [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nThen at time t, span is [τ + s(t - 13), h + s(t - 13)] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, collision if 0 is in [τ + s(t - 13), h + s(t - 13)].\n\nWhich means τ + s(t - 13) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(t - 13)\n\nSince τ < h.\n\nSo for each car, we can solve for t when 0 is in the interval.\n\nLet Δt = t - 13.\n\nThen for a car with tail τ, head h, speed s, right-moving.\n\n0 ∈ [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] iff τ + s Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s Δt, which is equivalent to:\n\n- s Δt ≤ -τ  and s Δt ≥ -h\n\nSince s > 0, we can divide.\n\nFirst inequality: τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ s Δt ≤ -τ ⇒ Δt ≤ -τ / s\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ h + s Δt ⇒ -h ≤ s Δt ⇒ Δt ≥ -h / s\n\nAlso, since the span is inclusive, I assume, so when equal, it is covered.\n\nSo Δt must satisfy: -h / s ≤ Δt ≤ -τ / s\n\nBecause from Δt ≥ -h/s and Δt ≤ -τ/s\n\nSince h and τ could be negative.\n\nNow, let's compute for each car on each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1 at t1=13:\n\nCars:\n\n1. h=12, τ=1, s=6\n\nThen Δt ≥ -12/6 = -2, and Δt ≤ -1/6? Let's see.\n\nΔt min = -h/s = -12/6 = -2\n\nΔt max = -τ/s = -1/6? τ=1, so -τ/s = -1/6\n\nBut Δt = t - 13, so for t, when Δt from -2 to -1/6.\n\nBut t ≥ 13, so Δt ≥0, so this interval Δt from -2 to -1/6 is before t=13, so for t≥13, this car never covers 0 because Δt ≥0 > -1/6? -1/6 ≈ -0.166, so for Δt ≥0, Δt > -1/6, so Δt > max lower bound? Let's see the inequality.\n\nWe have Δt ≥ -h/s = -12/6 = -2\n\nΔt ≤ -τ/s = -1/6 ≈ -0.166\n\nSo for Δt in [-2, -0.166], 0 is covered.\n\nSince Δt ≥0 for t≥13, and -0.166 <0, so for Δt ≥0, Δt > -0.166, so Δt ≤ -0.166 is false, so no overlap, so for t≥13, this car never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 1: h=-24, τ=-35, s=6\n\nh=-24, τ=-35\n\nThen Δt ≥ -h/s = -(-24)/6 = 24/6 = 4\n\nΔt ≤ -τ/s = -(-35)/6 = 35/6 ≈ 5.833\n\nSo for Δt from 4 to 35/6 ≈5.833, so t from 13+4=17 to 13+5.833=18.833, since t integer, t=17,18,19? Let's see.\n\nΔt ≥4 and Δt ≤ 35/6 ≈5.833, so for integer t, Δt integer? t is turn, integer, so Δt integer.\n\nt integer, Δt integer.\n\nSo Δt from 4 to 5 inclusive? Δt ≥4 and Δt ≤5.833, so Δt=4,5 since 5≤5.833, 6>5.833? 35/6=5 + 5/6≈5.833, so Δt≤5.833, so Δt=4,5 because 4≥4, 5≤5.833, Δt=6=6>5.833 not ≤, so only Δt=4,5.\n\nThus t=13+4=17, 13+5=18.\n\nAt t=17 and t=18, 0 covered by this car.\n\nThird car on freeway 1: h=54, τ=43, s=6\n\nΔt ≥ -h/s = -54/6 = -9\n\nΔt ≤ -τ/s = -43/6 ≈ -7.166\n\nSo Δt from -9 to -7.166, which is before t=13, since Δt≥0 > -7.166, so never for t≥13.\n\nSo for freeway 1, only dangerous at t=17 and t=18 due to second car.\n\nNow freeway 2: only one car: h=-12, τ=-47, s=36\n\nΔt ≥ -h/s = -(-12)/36 = 12/36 = 1/3 ≈0.333\n\nΔt ≤ -τ/s = -(-47)/36 = 47/36 ≈1.3056\n\nSo Δt from 1/3 to 47/36 ≈0.333 to 1.3056\n\nSince Δt integer, Δt=1? Because Δt=0: 0 < 0.333, not ≥\n\nΔt=1: 1 ≥ 0.333 and 1 ≤ 1.3056, yes\n\nΔt=2: 2 > 1.3056, not ≤, so only Δt=1, t=13+1=14\n\nSo at t=14, 0 covered on freeway 2.\n\nNow freeway 3: two cars, but same for all freeways 3 to 8.\n\nFirst car: h=30, τ=19, s=6\n\nΔt ≥ -h/s = -30/6 = -5\n\nΔt ≤ -τ/s = -19/6 ≈ -3.166\n\nΔt from -5 to -3.166, before t=13, so never.\n\nSecond car: h=-36, τ=-47, s=6\n\nΔt ≥ -h/s = -(-36)/6 = 36/6 = 6\n\nΔt ≤ -τ/s = -(-47)/6 = 47/6 ≈7.833\n\nSo Δt from 6 to 7.833, so Δt=6,7\n\nt=13+6=19, 13+7=20\n\nSo for each freeway k=3 to 8, dangerous at t=19 and t=20 due to the second car.\n\nNow, freeway 1 we have t=17,18 dangerous.\n\nFreeway 2 only t=14 dangerous.\n\nAnd freeways 3-8 dangerous at t=19,20.\n\nNow, y=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at t=13, y=6.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn, say t=13+H-1, so after H actions, from t=13 to t=13+H-1, we have H turns of actions.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAt t=13, y_13=6.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nWe need y_{t_final} =9 for some t_final.\n\nSince we move step by step, to reach y=9, we must pass through y=7,8,9.\n\nBut y=9 is safe, so once there, done.\n\nNow, minimal H, so we want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on a dangerous freeway at dangerous times.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway, when it is dangerous:\n\ny=1: dangerous at t=17,18\n\ny=2: dangerous at t=14\n\ny=3: dangerous at t=19,20\n\nSimilarly y=4,5,6,7,8 all dangerous at t=19,20\n\ny=1 has different times.\n\nNow, player at t=13, y=6.\n\ny=6 at t=13 is safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, we want to go to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nBut D would decrease y, which might not help, so probably only U or S to save time.\n\nMinimal turns: if we go up every turn, from y=6 to y=7 at t=14, y=8 at t=15, y=9 at t=16.\n\nThen at t=16, we reach y=9, safe.\n\nNow, check if any collision during the path.\n\nAt t=13, y=6: safe.\n\nAction: say a_{13} = U, then y_{14} =7\n\nAt t=14, position y=7? At turn t=14, we are at y_{14}.\n\nAt t=13, after action, y_{14} is set.\n\nSequence:\n\nAt turn t=13: we are at y_{13}=6, choose a_{13}, which sets y_{14} = y_{13} + Δy\n\nThen at turn t=13, we check collision: since y_{13}=6, and freeway 6 at t=13: as before, not dangerous, safe.\n\nThen at turn t=14: we are at y_{14}, which was set by previous action.\n\ny_{14} could be 5,6,7 depending on a_{13}.\n\nIf a_{13}=U, y_{14}=7\n\nThen at t=14, position y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 at t=14: is it dangerous?\n\nFreeway 7 is one of y=3-8, dangerous only at t=19,20.\n\nAt t=14, not dangerous, so safe.\n\nThen we choose a_{14}, say U, then y_{15}=8\n\nAt t=15, position y=8, freeway 8.\n\nAt t=15, not dangerous time (dangerous at 19,20), so safe.\n\nThen choose a_{15}=U, y_{16}=9\n\nAt t=16, position y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo in three turns, we reach y=9 at t=16.\n\nBut is t=16 the turn when we are at y=9?\n\nt=13: y=6\n\na_{13}=U: y_{14}=7\n\nt=14: y=7, action a_{14}=U: y_{15}=8\n\nt=15: y=8, action a_{15}=U: y_{16}=9\n\nt=16: y=9, no action needed? But we need to specify actions until we reach.\n\nAt t=16, we are at y=9, which is the goal, so we don't need to take action at t=16 if we are already there.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from t=13 to t=13+H-1, and after H actions, we are at y=9 at turn t=13 + H.\n\nLet's see the turn numbering.\n\nAt turn t=13, we start at y=6.\n\nAfter first action a_{t1} = a_{13}, we go to y_{14}.\n\nAfter second action a_{14}, to y_{15}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd H minimal.\n\nIn the above, with three actions:\n\na_{13} = U: to y=7\n\na_{14} = U: to y=8\n\na_{15} = U: to y=9\n\nThen at turn t=15 +1? After a_{15}, we are at y_{16}=9.\n\nSo at turn t=16, we are at y=9.\n\nThe position at turn t=16 is y=9, which is safe.\n\nAnd we took actions at t=13,14,15.\n\nSo H=3 actions, reach at t=16.\n\nNow, during the path:\n\nt=13: y=6, safe\n\nt=14: y=7, freeway 7 at t=14: not dangerous, safe\n\nt=15: y=8, freeway 8 at t=15: not dangerous (19,20), safe\n\nt=16: y=9, safe.\n\nBut what about freeway 2 at t=14? At t=14, we are on y=7, not on y=2, so we don't care about y=2.\n\nOnly care about the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nSo seems no problem.\n\nBut y=2 is dangerous at t=14, but we are on y=7 at t=14, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, other dangerous times not relevant.\n\nSo with H=3, it should be possible.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 7 at t=14.\n\nFreeway 7: cars at t=13: [19,30] and [-47,-36]\n\nAt t=14, Δt=1, so spans: [19+6*1, 30+6*1] = [25,36], and [-47+6, -36+6] = [-41,-30]\n\n0 not in either, so safe.\n\nSimilarly at t=15, y=8: spans [19+12,30+12]? Δt=t-13, at t=15, Δt=2, [19+12=31,42], [-47+12=-35,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nYes.\n\nBut earlier I thought freeways 3-8 dangerous at t=19,20, but at t=19, Δt=6, spans: [19+36=55,30+36=66]? s=6, Δt=6, [19+36? s*Δt=6*6=36, so [19+36,30+36]=[55,66], and [-47+36, -36+36]=[-11,0]\n\nAt t=19, Δt=6, second car span: τ + s Δt = -47 + 36 = -11? s=6, Δt=6, s Δt=36, so [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-47 +36, -36 +36] = [-11, 0]\n\nNow, 0 is in [-11,0]? Since inclusive, yes, 0 ≤ 0 and -11 ≤ 0, so 0 is covered.\n\nSimilarly at t=20, Δt=7, [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nBut at t=14,15, not covered.\n\nSo in our path, we are fine.\n\nBut in the direct up, we go to y=7 at t=14, which is safe.\n\nBut is there a problem with freeway 2 at t=14?\n\nFreeway 2 is y=2, we are on y=7 at t=14, so no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should check if we need to go through other points.\n\nBut with H=3, it seems possible.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do in 3 turns.\n\nBut let me see if at t=13, we can go up immediately.\n\ny=6 at t=13 safe, go to y=7.\n\nBut at t=14, y=7, which is freeway 7, safe as above.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 1 or others, but not relevant.\n\nMaybe I misread the car on freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2: only at t=14 dangerous, but we are not on it.\n\nAnother thing: the player at y=6 at t=13, but if we stay, we might be safe, but going up is better.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider if going up at certain times causes issue.\n\nBut in this case, no.\n\nBut let me list all dangerous times per freeway:\n\ny=1: t=17,18\n\ny=2: t=14\n\ny=3: t=19,20\n\ny=4: t=19,20\n\ny=5: t=19,20\n\ny=6: t=19,20\n\ny=7: t=19,20\n\ny=8: t=19,20\n\ny=0 and 9 always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at t=13, y=6.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe fastest: go directly up.\n\nt=13: y=6, safe, action U to y=7\n\nt=14: y=7, safe (since t=14 not 19-20), action U to y=8\n\nt=15: y=8, safe, action U to y=9\n\nt=16: y=9, done.\n\nActions at t=13,14,15.\n\nH=3.\n\nBut is there a reason we cannot do this?\n\nAt t=14, if we were on y=2, it would be dangerous, but we are on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, no conflict.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we move down or stay, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if at t=13 we stay, y=6, then at t=14, we can go up, but y=6 at t=14: is it dangerous?\n\nFreeway 6 dangerous only at t=19,20, so at t=14, safe. But going up directly is faster.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down, worse.\n\nSo minimal H should be 3.\n\nBut let me check the answer format.\n\nIt says \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn the sequence, we need to output actions starting from t1.\n\nSo for t1=13: a_{13} = U\n\nThen t13+1=14: a_{14}=U\n\nt13+2=15: a_{15}=U\n\nThen after that, at t=16, we are at y=9.\n\nH=3.\n\nBut is t=16 the turn when we reach? Yes.\n\nPerhaps we need to specify until we reach.\n\nIn the sequence, we have three actions.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point collision.\n\nt=13: position y=6, freeway 6 cars: at t=13, spans [19,30] and [-47,-36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U, so y_{14}=7\n\nt=14: position y=7, freeway 7 cars: similarly, at t=14, Δt=1, [19+6=25,30+6=36] and [-47+6=-41,-36+6=-30], 0 not in [-41,-30] nor [25,36], safe.\n\nAction U, y_{15}=8\n\nt=15: position y=8, freeway 8 cars: at t=15, Δt=2, [19+12=31,30+12=42] and [-47+12=-35,-36+12=-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U, y_{16}=9\n\nt=16: y=9, no car, safe. Goal reached.\n\nPerfect.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and we do.\n\nBut is there a car on freeway 8 at other times? No.\n\nBut earlier I thought about freeway 2 at t=14, but irrelevant.\n\nPerhaps for y=1 at t=17,18, but we are not there.\n\nSo I think H=3 is possible.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 at t=14: car with τ=-47, h=-12, s=36, at t=14, Δt=1, span [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-47 + 36*1, -12 + 36*1] = [-11, 24], and 0 is in [-11,24], yes, so dangerous at t=14 for y=2.\n\nBut we are on y=7, not y=2.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nPerhaps the player might consider moving to avoid, but no need.\n\nSo minimal H is 3.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nIn the format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nFor H actions.\n\nSo here:\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nThen at turn 16, we are at (0,9).\n\nBut the sequence has three actions, from t=13 to t=15.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nSo for t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t_1 + t.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at position at time t_1 + H.\n\nAnd we need y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, H=3, actions at t=13,14,15 (t=0,1,2 offset), position at t=16 is 9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster? From y=6 to y=9, minimum 3 actions, since each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo H=3 is minimum possible.\n\nAnd we achieved it.\n\nBut is there a constraint that we must not be on certain positions?\n\nAnother thing: when we move, the collision note, but in this case, we moved from y=7 to y=8 at t=14, at t=14 we are on y=7, not on y=8 until t=15, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut let me see the freeway 1, but not relevant.\n\nPerhaps I should list for all freeways the dangerous times to be sure.\n\ny=1: dangerous at t=17,18\n\ny=2: dangerous at t=14\n\ny=3 to 8: dangerous at t=19,20\n\ny=0,9: never dangerous.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=6 at t=13 (safe), y=7 at t=14 (safe), y=8 at t=15 (safe), y=9 at t=16 (safe).\n\nNo overlap with dangerous times.\n\nIf we stayed at y=6 at t=13, then at t=14 y=6, still safe, but then we go up later, takes more turns.\n\nSimilarly, if we went down, worse.\n\nSo H=3 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the answer format should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} ... }\n\nWith t_1=13.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U }\n\nIn the text, it might be written as:\n\nTurn 13: a_{13} etc.\n\nBut in the box, I think we write it clearly.\n\nSince it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so for this case.\n\nBut t_1 is given as 13.\n\nPerhaps we need to specify the actions only.\n\nAnother thing: in the car update, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\" no.\n\nLet me double-check the car update.\n\nIn the problem:\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\n\"Right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for right-moving, head is the front, so if moving right, head has larger x, so span is [tail, head] or [head, tail]?\n\nIn the update, for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd it says \"head h, tail τ\", so for right-moving, τ is tail, h is head, so span [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] with h > τ? For left-moving, head is front, so if moving left, head has larger x initially, but as it moves left, x decreases.\n\nIn the update: left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - s ΔT, τ - s ΔT]\n\nSince moving left, positions decrease.\n\nIn this problem, all cars are right-moving, so we used correctly.\n\nIn freeway 1, first car: head=12, tail=1, so τ=1, h=12, span [1,12] at t1.\n\nAfter time, moves right.\n\nIn our calculation, we have the dangerous times.\n\nFor freeway 2, car with head=-12, tail=-47, so τ=-47, h=-12, span [-47,-12] at t1.\n\nMoving right, speed 36.\n\nAt t=14, span [-47+36, -12+36] = [-11,24], contains 0.\n\nYes.\n\nBut not relevant for us.\n\nSo I think the direct path is fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=3, sequence: U at t=13, U at t=14, U at t=15.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U }\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so probably:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U }\n\nSince t_1=13.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nPerhaps write as:\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe dangerous times for each freeway, when a car covers \\(x = 0\\), are:\n- Freeway 1: turns 17 and 18\n- Freeway 2: turn 14\n- Freeways 3 to 8: turns 19 and 20\n\nThe player's path must avoid these freeways at these specific turns. Positions \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) are always safe.\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 6\\) is 3, as each move changes \\(y\\) by at most 1.\n\nA sequence of actions to achieve this in \\(H = 3\\) turns is:\n- At turn 13: Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\). Position at turn 13 is \\(y = 6\\), which is safe (freeway 6 at turn 13 is not dangerous).\n- At turn 14: Move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\). Position at turn 14 is \\(y = 7\\), which is safe (freeway 7 at turn 14 is not dangerous).\n- At turn 15: Move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\). Position at turn 15 is \\(y = 8\\), which is safe (freeway 8 at turn 15 is not dangerous).\n\nAt turn 16, the player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is safe and the goal position.\n\nThis sequence avoids all dangerous freeway times:\n- Turn 13: On \\(y = 6\\) (safe, not dangerous at turn 13).\n- Turn 14: On \\(y = 7\\) (safe, not dangerous at turn 14; freeway 2 is dangerous at turn 14 but player is not on it).\n- Turn 15: On \\(y = 8\\) (safe, not dangerous at turn 15).\n\nThus, the minimal \\(H\\) is 3, with the sequence of actions as above.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U }",

I need to reach y=9, which is the top row, but y=9 is not a freeway; the freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think. The collision only happens if I'm on a freeway y=1 to 8 and there's a car there at that turn.\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9) at some turn, and since y=9 is not a freeway, no cars there, so I just need to arrive at y=9.\n\nNow, the player moves up, down, or stay with actions U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars move on their freeways with constant speed. For left-moving, head and tail decrease, for right-moving, they increase.\n\nThe car update: for a car on freeway i, at time T, the span is given based on t1=14.\n\nt1=14 is the current turn, so for any future turn T, the car positions are linear from t1.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if I am on freeway y_T and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at time T.\n\nImportant note: when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T. If I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am still on y_T at time T, and only move to y_{T+1} at the next turn. So at time T, I am on row y_T, and I might collide only with cars on that row at time T.\n\nThen, after moving, at time T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nSo for collision, at each turn, when I am at position (0, y_t), if y_t is between 1 and 8, I need to check if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at time t.\n\nOtherwise, no collision.\n\nNow, I start at t=14, y=7.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is two rows up, so minimum two moves: U,U to go directly, but I have to avoid cars on the way.\n\nCurrently at y=7, which is a freeway, so I need to check if at t=14, on freeway 7, is there a car such that 0 is in span?\n\nFreeway 7 has cars: (36,25,right,6) and (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nFirst, let's understand the car spans.\n\nFor right-moving cars, span is [τ, h], and it moves right, so at time T, position is τ + s(T - t1) to h + s(T - t1)\n\nSimilarly for left, but all cars here seem to be right-moving, from the table.\n\nLet me list all cars:\n\nFreeway 1: cars (18,7,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6), (60,49,right,6)\n\nFreeway 2: (24,-11,right,36)\n\nFreeway 3: (36,25,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3? It says (36,25,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6) for freeway 4,5,6,7,8? No, let's see:\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1 it has three cars, freeway 2 one car, then freeway 3 to 8 all have the same: (36,25,right,6) and (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nIs that right? Let me read:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\n1 | (18,7,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6), (60,49,right,6)\n\n2 | (24,-11,right,36)\n\n3 | (36,25,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6)\n\n4 | (36,25,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6)\n\n5 | (36,25,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6)\n\n6 | (36,25,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6)\n\n7 | (36,25,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6)\n\n8 | (36,25,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nYes, so freeways 3 to 8 all have identical cars? That seems odd, but okay, I'll take it as is.\n\nNow, for freeway 7 at time t=14, I need to check if 0 is in any car span.\n\nFirst car: (36,25,right,6), so at t=14, head h=36, tail τ=25? For right-moving, span is [τ, h] so [25,36] at t=14.\n\nThe notation: (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, head is the front, so higher number, tail is lower, so span [τ, h], meaning from τ to h inclusive, I assume.\n\nSimilarly for left, but here all right.\n\nSo at t=14, freeway 7, car1: [25,36], so positions from 25 to 36, 0 is not in this.\n\nCar2: (-30,-41,right,6), so [τ,h] = [-41,-30], so from -41 to -30, 0 not in this.\n\nSo at t=14, on freeway 7, no car has 0 in span, so I am safe at start.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9. Since y=9 is safe, I can go up.\n\nBut if I go up to y=8 at some point, I need to be safe there.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go directly up: U to y=8, then U to y=9.\n\nBut I need to make sure that when I am on y=8, at that turn, no collision.\n\nAlso, when I move to y=8, at the turn I move, I am still on y=7 until I move, but let's think carefully.\n\nAt turn t=14, I am at y=7.\n\nIf I take action U at t=14, then at turn t=14, I am on y=7, and I move, so at the end of turn t=14, I set y_{15} = y_{14} + Δy = 7 +1 =8.\n\nThen at turn t=15, I am at (0,8).\n\nSimilarly, if I take U at t=15, I go to y=9 at t=16.\n\nNow, collision is checked at each turn based on where I am at that turn.\n\nSo for turn t=14, I am on y=7, which we saw is safe.\n\nThen if I take U, at t=15 I am on y=8.\n\nI need to check if at t=15, on freeway 8, is 0 in any car span.\n\nFreeway 8 has cars: same as 7? Freeway 8: (36,25,right,6) and (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nAt time T, for a car, the span is based on T - t1.\n\nt1=14.\n\nSo for turn T, time elapsed Δt = T - 14.\n\nFor freeway 8 at time T, car positions.\n\nFirst car: (36,25,right,6), so at time T, since right-moving, position: τ + s(T-14) to h + s(T-14) = 25 + 6*(T-14) to 36 + 6*(T-14)\n\nSimilarly, second car: τ = -41, h = -30, so span: -41 + 6*(T-14) to -30 + 6*(T-14)\n\nNow, for T=15, Δt=1, so:\n\nCar1: 25 + 6*1 = 31 to 36 + 6*1 = 42, so [31,42]\n\nCar2: -41 + 6*1 = -35 to -30 + 6*1 = -24, so [-35,-24]\n\n0 not in either, so at t=15, y=8 is safe.\n\nThen I can take U at t=15 to go to y=9 at t=16.\n\nAt t=16, I am at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision, and I reach the goal.\n\nH=2 turns: from t=14 to t=15 and t=15 to t=16, so actions at t=14 and t=15.\n\nSequence: t=14: U, t=15: U, and at t=16 I am at (0,9).\n\nBut is this minimal? H is the number of turns, I think H=2, since I start at t=14, after 0 actions, I am at start. After 1 action at t=14, I am at y=8 at t=15. After 2 actions, at t=16, y=9.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t=0 is t1, t=1 is t1+1, etc.\n\nHere t1=14, so a_{14} and a_{15}, H=2.\n\nBut let me confirm if at t=15 on y=8 it is indeed safe.\n\nWe have [31,42] and [-35,-24], 0 not in, yes.\n\nSimilarly, at start t=14, y=7: freeway 7 cars.\n\nAt t=14, car1: [25,36], car2: [-41,-30]? At t=14, Δt=0.\n\nCar1: τ=25, h=36, so [25,36]\n\nCar2: τ=-41, h=-30, so [-41,-30], 0 not in.\n\nBut freeway 7 has two cars, both not covering 0.\n\nIn the table, freeway 7 has (36,25,right,6) and (-30,-41,right,6), so head and tail, for right, head is higher, so first car head 36, tail 25, so [25,36]\n\nSecond car head -30, tail -41, so since head should be greater than tail for right-moving, here head=-30, tail=-41, -30 > -41, so span [ -41, -30 ], yes.\n\n0 not in.\n\nBut is there any other freeway? No, only when I am on that row.\n\nBut in this path, I only visit y=7 at t=14 and y=8 at t=15.\n\ny=7 at t=14 safe, y=8 at t=15 safe.\n\nThen I can go to y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is not reached until t=16, but since no freeway, it's fine.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so at some turn, y_t=9.\n\nHere at t=16, y=9.\n\nBut let me see if I can do it in one turn? From y=7 to y=9 in one move? But I can only change by +1 per turn, so minimum two moves to go up two rows. I could go down, but that would take more turns, not minimal. So H=2 is minimal.\n\nBut is there a car that might hit at t=15 on y=8?\n\nFreeway 8 at t=15: as above, [31,42] and [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nBut let me check freeway 8 cars: same as others, (36,25,right,6) so at T=15, since s=6, Δt=1, 25+6=31, 36+6=42, [31,42]\n\nSecond car: τ=-41, h=-30, at T=15, -41 +6= -35, -30+6= -24, [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, for other times, but in this path, I don't care.\n\nBut the problem is freeways 3 to 8 all have the same cars? But they are different freeways, so each has its own cars, but in this case, since the cars are identical, it might be fine.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 2 and 1, but I don't go there.\n\nIn this direct path, it seems safe.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 2: (24,-11,right,36)\n\nSpeed 36, high speed.\n\nBut I don't go to y=2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1 has cars, but I start at y=7, not on 1.\n\nBut in this path, I only go to y=8.\n\nPerhaps there is a problem at t=15.\n\nAnother thing: the player position is (0,y), so x=0 always, I think, since we only care about x=0 for collision.\n\nCollision if 0 in car span at that turn on that freeway.\n\nSo for freeway 8 at t=15, 0 not in any span.\n\nBut let me see if at some other time, 0 is covered.\n\nFor example, on freeway 8, when is 0 covered?\n\nFor car1: span [25 + 6Δt, 36 + 6Δt], set 0 in [25+6Δt, 36+6Δt], so 25+6Δt <= 0 <= 36+6Δt.\n\nSince 25+6Δt <=0, 6Δt <= -25, Δt <= -25/6 ≈ -4.166, but Δt = T-14 >=0 for future, so never.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <=36+6Δt always true for Δt>=0, but 25+6Δt >0 for Δt>=0, so 0 not in [31,42] etc.\n\nSimilarly, for car2: [-41 +6Δt, -30 +6Δt], 0 in this if -41+6Δt <=0 <= -30+6Δt.\n\nFirst, 0 <= -30+6Δt? So 6Δt >=30, Δt >=5.\n\nAnd -41+6Δt <=0? 6Δt <=41, Δt <=41/6≈6.833.\n\nSo for Δt=5 to 6, 0 in the span.\n\nΔt=5: -41+30= -11, -30+30=0, so at Δt=5, span [-11,0], so 0 is included? [ -11, 0], does this include 0?\n\nThe span is [τ, h], which I think is inclusive, so yes, 0 is in [-11,0] at T=14+5=19.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=6: -41+36= -5, -30+36=6, span [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nΔt=7: -41+42=1, -30+42=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=19 and T=20, on freeway 8, for this car, 0 is in span if the car is on that freeway.\n\nBut for freeway 8, at T=19, car2 has span [-11,0], which includes 0, so if I am on y=8 at T=19, collision.\n\nSimilarly at T=20, span [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nBut in my plan, I am at y=8 only at t=15, which is T=15, Δt=1, not 5 or 6, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nBut in this case, for direct path, it seems fine.\n\nBut why am I doubting? Because the freeways 3-8 all have the same cars, so at T=19 and 20, all these freeways have a car covering 0, so if I am on any of them at that time, collision.\n\nBut I am not on them at that time in this short path.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if going directly is possible.\n\nAnother thing: at t=14, I am at y=7, which is safe.\n\nI take U, so at t=15, I am at y=8.\n\nNow, on freeway 8, at t=15, as above, cars: first car [31,42], second car [-35,-24], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen I take U again at t=15, to go to y=9 at t=16.\n\nAt t=16, y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo H=2, actions: t=14: U, t=15: U.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let me see if I can do it faster? No, minimum two moves.\n\nI could stay or go down, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nSo why is this a problem? Perhaps I misread the car states.\n\nFreeway 7 at t=14: cars (36,25,right,6) and (-30,-41,right,6)\n\n(-30,-41,right,6), head -30, tail -41, so for right-moving, span [τ,h] = [-41,-30] at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 8 same.\n\nBut at t=15, freeway 8: car1: 25+6=31 to 36+6=42\n\nCar2: -41+6= -35 to -30+6= -24\n\n-35 to -24, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 7 at t=14, car2: [-41,-30], 0 not in.\n\nBut let me check if on freeway 7, when is 0 covered.\n\nCar1: [25+6Δt, 36+6Δt], min 25>0, so never.\n\nCar2: [-41+6Δt, -30+6Δt], 0 in when -41+6Δt <=0 <= -30+6Δt\n\nAs before, Δt >= ceil(30/6)=5, and Δt <= floor(41/6)=6, since 41/6=6.833, so Δt=5,6\n\nAt T=14+5=19, span [-41+30, -30+30] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nT=20: [-41+36, -30+36] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nT=21: [-41+42, -30+42] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=19 and 20, on freeway 7, car2 covers 0.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways 3-8.\n\nBut in my path, I am not on freeway 7 at T=19 or 20, only at t=14, which is fine.\n\nt=14 is T=14, Δt=0, span [-41,-30], no 0.\n\nSo for the direct path, it should be safe.\n\nBut perhaps for freeway 8 at t=15, is there an issue?\n\nFreeway 8 has the same cars, at t=15 Δt=1, car2 [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nBut let me see the first car on freeway 1 or something, but no.\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 2: (24,-11,right,36)\n\nAt t=14, span [ -11, 24]? τ=-11, h=24, so [ -11, 24], which includes 0? At t=14, Δt=0, span [τ,h] = [-11,24], and 0 is between -11 and 24, so yes, 0 is in the span.\n\nBut freeway 2 at t=14, so if I were on y=2 at t=14, I would collide, but I am on y=7, not y=2.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nSimilarly, at other times.\n\nBut for my path, I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and with two ups, I do.\n\nBut let me see if there is any reason I cannot go directly.\n\nPerhaps at t=15 on y=8, but we saw it's safe.\n\nMaybe I should consider the movement.\n\nAnother point: when I move, at the turn I move, I am on the starting row.\n\nFor example, at t=14, I am on y=7, I take U, so during the turn, I move, but the collision is checked at the turn based on position, I think at the beginning or when the action is taken.\n\nThe note says: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T if you move\"\n\nSo at turn T, you are on y_T.\n\nThen after action, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nSo for collision, only at T for y_T.\n\nIn this case, at t=14, y=7, safe.\n\nAction U, so y_{15}=8.\n\nThen at t=15, I am on y=8, need to check.\n\nAs above, safe.\n\nThen action U, y_{16}=9.\n\nAt t=16, y=9, no freeway, no collision.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut perhaps for freeway 8, at t=15, with the cars, but 0 not in span.\n\nMaybe I misread the car for freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 has (36,25,right,6) so at t=15, 25+6=31, 36+6=42, [31,42], 0 not in.\n\n(-30,-41,right,6) at t=15, -41+6= -35, -30+6= -24, [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nSo yes.\n\nPerhaps the tail and head; for right-moving, if head is less than tail, but in the notation, for the second car, head=-30, tail=-41, which is fine, head > tail.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think the direct path works.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nI need to output the actions.\n\nBut the car states for freeways 3-8 are all the same, but it should be ok.\n\nPerhaps there is a car on freeway 8 that I missed, but no.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 1 has a car at t=14: (18,7,right,6), so [7,18] at t=14, which includes 0? 7 to 18, 0 not in, since 7>0.\n\nSimilarly, other cars on freeway 1: (-18,-29,right,6) [-29,-18], 0 not in.\n\n(60,49,right,6) [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 2: (24,-11,right,36) at t=14, [-11,24], includes 0, but I am not on y=2.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2, with actions U at t=14 and U at t=15.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nAnd done.\n\nBut the answer should be in a box.\n\nPerhaps I should write it.\n\nBut let me confirm if at t=15 on y=8 it is safe for all freeways, but only freeway 8 matters.\n\nFreeway 8 at t=15: as above.\n\nTo be thorough, let's compute the span at t=15 for freeway 8.\n\nΔt = t - t1 = 15 - 14 =1\n\nCar1: head=36, tail=25, s=6, right, so new head = 36 + 6*1 =42, new tail = 25 + 6*1=31, span [31,42]\n\nCar2: head=-30, tail=-41, s=6, new head = -30 + 6*1 = -24, new tail = -41 + 6*1 = -35, span [-35,-24]\n\n0 not in [31,42] or [-35,-24], so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=14 for y=7: car1 [25,36], car2 [-41,-30], 0 not in.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of turns is 2.\n\nSo the actions are:\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so t=0: t1=14, action a_{14}\n\nt=1: t1+1=15, action a_{15}\n\nThen at turn t1 + H =16, position (0,9)\n\nH=2 turns.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 14\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player starts at (0, 7) at turn 14.\n- The target position (0, 9) is not on a freeway (freeways are only \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)), so no collision check is needed once reached.\n- To move from \\(y = 7\\) to \\(y = 9\\), the player must increase their \\(y\\)-coordinate by 2. Since each action \\(U\\) increases \\(y\\) by 1, the minimal number of turns required is \\(H = 2\\), with actions \\(U\\) at turn 14 and \\(U\\) at turn 15.\n- Collision must be checked at each turn based on the player's position at that turn.\n\n#### Collision Check at Turn 14 (Position \\(y = 7\\)):\n- Freeway 7 has cars: (36, 25, right, 6) and (-30, -41, right, 6).\n- At turn 14 (\\(\\Delta t = 0\\)):\n  - Car 1: span = [25, 36] (0 not in span).\n  - Car 2: span = [-41, -30] (0 not in span).\n- Since 0 is not in any car span on freeway 7, no collision occurs.\n\n#### Collision Check at Turn 15 (Position \\(y = 8\\)):\n- Freeway 8 has cars: (36, 25, right, 6) and (-30, -41, right, 6).\n- At turn 15 (\\(\\Delta t = 1\\)):\n  - Car 1: new tail = 25 + 6 × 1 = 31, new head = 36 + 6 × 1 = 42, span = [31, 42] (0 not in span).\n  - Car 2: new tail = -41 + 6 × 1 = -35, new head = -30 + 6 × 1 = -24, span = [-35, -24] (0 not in span).\n- Since 0 is not in any car span on freeway 8, no collision occurs.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The sequence of actions \\(U\\) at turn 14 and \\(U\\) at turn 15 achieves the position (0, 9) at turn 16 with \\(H = 2\\) turns.\n- No fewer turns are possible, as moving from \\(y = 7\\) to \\(y = 9\\) requires at least two upward moves.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U\n}",

The vertical axis y goes from 0 to 9, so from y=8 to y=9, it's only one step up. But I have to avoid collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player is at y=8, and the target is y=9. Since y=9 is not a freeway (freeways are y=1 to y=8), there are no cars on y=9. So, to reach (0,9), I just need to move up from y=8 to y=9. But I need to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row, I don't collide with cars at that turn.\n\nThe collision rule says: collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T and 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAlso, note that when you move, you are not on the new row until the next turn. So if you move at turn T to y_{T+1}, you are still on y_T during turn T, and on y_{T+1} starting from turn T+1.\n\nIn this case, player is at (0,8) at turn t_1=15. y=8 is a freeway, so I need to check if there's a collision at turn 15 with cars on y=8.\n\nLet me list the cars on freeway 8, since that's where the player is now.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFor freeway 8: cars are (42, 31, right, 6) and (-24, -35, right, 6)\n\nDirection is right, so these are right-moving cars. For right-moving, span is [tail, head] or [head, tail]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h] and at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 8: (42, 31, right, 6) and (-24, -35, right, 6)\n\nFor the first car: h=42, τ=31, d=right, s=6\n\nSince direction is right, and for right-moving, the span is given as [τ, h] at t_1? Let's read carefully.\n\nThe update rule says: for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the input, for each car, it's given as (head h, tail τ, ...), so for right-moving, head is the front, tail is the back, so when moving right, head is larger if we assume increasing x.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, at t_1, it's [τ, h] meaning from τ to h, with τ < h since moving right.\n\nSimilarly for left, [h, τ] with h > τ, moving left.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 8, both cars are right-moving.\n\nFirst car: h=42, τ=31, so at t_1=15, span is [31, 42]? Since right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [31, 42]\n\nThe notation says: for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\n\nYes, so [31, 42] for first car.\n\nSecond car: h=-24, τ=-35, d=right, s=6\n\nτ=-35, h=-24, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nNow, at turn T, collision if player is on that freeway and 0 is in the span at that turn.\n\nAt turn t_1=15, player is on freeway y=8.\n\nWe need to check if 0 is in Span(T) for any car on y=8 at T=15.\n\nFor first car on y=8: Span(15) = [31, 42], 0 is not between 31 and 42, so no collision.\n\nSecond car: Span(15) = [-35, -24], 0 is not between -35 and -24, since -35 to -24 is all negative, 0 is not in there.\n\nSo at turn 15, no collision on y=8.\n\nPlayer is at (0,8), and wants to go to (0,9).\n\nTo move to y=9, at turn 15, player can take action U, which would make y_{16} = y_{15} +1 = 8+1=9.\n\nBut during turn 15, player is still on y=8, so we need to check for collision at turn 15 on y=8, which we did, no collision.\n\nThen at turn 16, player is on y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars, and position is (0,9), so we reached in one step? H should be the number of turns from start, so from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -1, with y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIf we take action at turn 15: U, then at turn 16, y=9, so we reached at turn 16, which is turn t_1 +1.\n\nt_1 =15, so turn 15: position y=8\n\nAfter action at turn 15, y_{16} =9.\n\nSo at turn 16, position is (0,9), which is the target.\n\nNumber of turns H: we start from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIf we do nothing, at turn t_1, we are at (0,8), not (0,9).\n\nAfter one action, at turn t_1 +1, y could be 9.\n\nSet t = t_1 + τ, for τ from 0.\n\nAt time t_1, player position is given.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, y_{t_1 +1} is updated.\n\nThen at time t_1 +1, we have new position.\n\nThe target is to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor H=1: at turn t_1 +1 -1 = t_1, y_{t_1} should be 9, but it is 8, so not possible.\n\nH is the number of actions, and we reach at turn after H actions? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nAfter these actions, the position is after H steps.\n\nStart at turn t_1, before any action, position is (0,8).\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, position y_{t_1+1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1+1}, at turn t_1+2, y_{t_1+2}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut the target is to reach (0,9), which should be at some turn.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nLet's read: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAlso, the actions are for t=0 to H-1, meaning actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter these actions, the position at time t_1 + H should be set, but we care about position at time t_1 + H -1.\n\nI think I'm confusing the indexing.\n\nLet me denote the time.\n\nAt time t_1 (current turn), position is (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,8)\n\nThen, we apply action a_{t_1}, which affects the position at time t_1+1: y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nSimilarly, at time t_1+1, we apply a_{t_1+1}, to get y_{t_1+2}, and so on.\n\nThe position at time T is y_T.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T, and T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nAlso, for each turn T from t_1 to T, we need to avoid collision when on freeway.\n\nCollision at turn T if on freeway y_T and 0 in car span on that freeway at T.\n\nIn this case, at time t_1=15, y=8, which is freeway, but we checked no collision.\n\nIf we take action U at t_1=15, then at time t_1+1=16, y=9, not freeway, so no issue.\n\nAnd at time 16, position is (0,9), which is the target if T=16 = t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =16, t_1=15, so 15 + H -1 =16, thus H=2.\n\nH=2 turns: actions at t=15 and t=16? But at t=16, we don't need to act if we are already at 9.\n\nThe sequence should include actions until we reach, but we reach at time 16, so the last action is at time 15.\n\nSequence: for t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have position at time t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at time t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, action at t_1, then position at time t_1+1 is set, and we want position at time t_1 +1 -1 = t_1 to be 9, but at t_1 it is 8, not 9.\n\nIf H=1, t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +1 -1 = t_1, so y_{t_1} should be 9, but it is 8, impossible.\n\nH=2: actions at t_1 and t_1+1? t from 0 to H-1=1, so actions at t_1 +0 and t_1 +1.\n\nAction at t_1: a_{t_1}, affects y_{t_1+1}\n\nAction at t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, affects y_{t_1+2}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1 +2-1} = y_{t_1+1} =9\n\nSo with H=2, we want y_{t_1+1} =9.\n\nThat means at time t_1+1, position is 9.\n\nHow? By taking action at t_1: U, then y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} +1 =8+1=9.\n\nThen, we don't need action at t_1+1, but in the sequence, for H=2, we have two actions, but at t_1+1, if we do nothing, S, then y_{t_1+2} = y_{t_1+1} +0 =9, but we want y_{t_1+1}=9, so the action at t_1+1 is not necessary for reaching at t_1+1.\n\nBut the sequence must have H actions, from t=0 to H-1.\n\nIf we set H=1, but y_{t_1} =8 ≠9, not possible.\n\nSo minimal H is 2, with actions: at t_1: U, and at t_1+1: S or something, but we need y_{t_1+1}=9, which is achieved by U at t_1.\n\nThen at t_1+1, we can do S, which keeps y=9.\n\nBut since we are at 9, and no further action needed, but the sequence must be of length H, so for H=2, we have two actions.\n\nThe target is reached at t_1 + H -1, which for H=2 is t_1+1.\n\nAnd at that time, we are at 9.\n\nNow, for collision: at turn t_1=15, y=8, freeway, we checked no collision.\n\nAt turn t_1+1=16, y=9, not freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nSo with H=2, actions: a_{t_1} = U, and a_{t_1+1} = S (since we stay, but it doesn't matter).\n\nBut we need to output the sequence for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so for H=2, actions at t_1 and t_1+1.\n\na_{t_1} = U to move to 9, a_{t_1+1} = S to stay at 9, but at time t_1+1, position is already 9, and action S keeps it.\n\nSince we reach at t_1+1, the action at t_1+1 might be redundant, but we have to include it because H=2.\n\nPerhaps we can have H=1, but impossible as above.\n\nAnother way: if we do nothing at t_1, S, then at t_1+1, y=8 still, not 9, and so on.\n\nSo to reach in one step, we need to move up at t_1.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions.\n\nAt turn t_1=15, on y=8, cars:\n\nFirst car: [31,42], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut the player is at (0,8), and x=0 is fixed, only y changes.\n\nNow, but there are other freeways, but since we are only on y=8 at turn 15, and moving to y=9 immediately, we don't encounter other freeways.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no issue.\n\nBut let's see the car states; all freeways have cars, but we only care when on that row.\n\nIn this case, with one action U at t_1=15, we reach y=9 at t_1+1=16.\n\nSo minimal H should be 2.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we can do it in one move.\n\nBut H is the number of turns including the start or what?\n\nPerhaps I should list the actions.\n\nBut let's see the answer format: it should be a sequence of actions starting from turn t_1.\n\nFor example, if H=2, it would be:\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: S  (or whatever, but S is fine)\n\nBut at turn 16, if we do S, position stays (0,9), and we are done.\n\nBut we need to make sure that during the process, no collision.\n\nAt turn 15: on y=8, no collision as above.\n\nAt turn 16: on y=9, no freeway, no collision.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nBut why are there all those car states? Maybe for other rows, but since we don't go there, it doesn't matter.\n\nPerhaps I need to check if moving up is possible, but it seems straightforward.\n\nBut let's see the car on freeway 8 at other times, but we only care about turn 15 for now.\n\nAnother thing: the player might need to wait or something, but here no need.\n\nBut let's see the cars on other freeways; for example, freeway 7 has cars, but we are not on y=7 at any point in this plan.\n\nIn this direct move, we are only on y=8 at turn 15.\n\nSo I think H=2 is possible.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbering.\n\nt_1 =15\n\nAt turn 15: position (0,8)\n\nAction a_15: U\n\nThen at turn 16: position (0,9)\n\nReached at turn 16.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =15 + H -1 =16, so H-1=1, H=2.\n\nYes.\n\nActions: a_{15} and a_{16} for the sequence.\n\na_{15} = U, a_{16} = S, for example.\n\na_{16} can be anything since we are at 9, but S is safe.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to specify.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter sequence, but H=1 is impossible.\n\nUnless we are already at 9, but we are at 8.\n\nSo minimal H is 2.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on y=8 at turn 15.\n\nCars: (42,31,right,6) and (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFor right-moving, span at T: [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nAt T=15, t_1=15, T-t_1=0, so span: [31 + 0, 42 + 0] = [31,42] for first car.\n\n[ -35 +0, -24 +0] = [-35,-24] for second.\n\n0 not in either.\n\nNow, if we stay at y=8, at turn 16, what happens?\n\nBut we don't need to stay.\n\nAt turn 16, if we were on y=8, but we move away.\n\nSuppose we take action at turn 15: S, then at turn 16, still (0,8), then we need to move later, which would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nSo U at turn 15 is best.\n\nBut is there a car that might come to x=0 at turn 15 or something? No, as above.\n\nPerhaps for other rows, but irrelevant.\n\nBut let me see the cars on y=8 for future turns, but we are not staying.\n\nFor example, at turn 16, if we were on y=8, span would be [τ + s(1), h + s(1)] = [31+6, 42+6] = [37,48] for first car, still not 0.\n\nSecond car: [-35+6, -24+6] = [-29,-18], not 0.\n\nSo even if we stayed, no immediate collision, but we want to go up.\n\nSo I think moving up immediately is fine.\n\nBut the player starts at y=8, and y=9 is above, so U is up to 9.\n\ny from 0 to 9, 0 bottom, 9 top, I assume.\n\nThe grid: vertical axis y=0,1,2,...,9, so y=0 is bottom, y=9 top, I think.\n\nPlayer at (0,8), so U to (0,9).\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the car update, for freeway 8, cars are moving, but at turn 15, x=0 is clear.\n\nPerhaps I should check if at turn 15, when we are at (0,8), it is safe.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thing: the note says \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nIn this case, at turn T=15, we move to y_{16}=9, so at turn 15, we are on y=8, not on y=9.\n\nCars on y=9 don't exist, so no issue.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut why are there so many cars listed? And for other freeways, like freeway 1,2,etc., but since we don't go there, it shouldn't matter.\n\nPerhaps the player needs to go through other rows, but in this case, from 8 to 9, directly.\n\nUnless y=8 has a car at x=0 at some turn, but at turn 15, no.\n\nBut let's see the minimal time.\n\nPerhaps I can reach in H=1, but impossible.\n\nOr H=2 with U at t_1.\n\nBut let me see if there is a reason to wait.\n\nFor example, on freeway 8, when will a car be at x=0?\n\nFor first car: span at time T: [31 + 6(T-15), 42 + 6(T-15)]\n\nSet 0 in [31 +6ΔT, 42 +6ΔT] for some ΔT.\n\n31 +6ΔT <= 0 <= 42 +6ΔT\n\nBut 31 +6ΔT >0 for ΔT >=0, since 31>0, so never <=0, so 0 not in span for this car.\n\nSimilarly, second car: [-35 +6ΔT, -24 +6ΔT]\n\nSet -35 +6ΔT <= 0 <= -24 +6ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -35 +6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833, so ΔT <=5\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -24 +6ΔT => 6ΔT >=24 => ΔT >=4\n\nSo for ΔT=4,5\n\nAt T=15+4=19, span: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0]? -35 +6*4 = -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0], so 0 is included, since it says \"in the span\", and it's a closed interval? Probably, since collision if 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly at T=20: -35+30= -5, -24+30=6, so [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt T=19: [ -11, 0], 0 is endpoint, included.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut we are not staying; we are leaving at turn 15.\n\nSo at turn 15, no issue.\n\nTherefore, with action U at turn 15, we move to y=9 at turn 16, safe.\n\nSo minimal H=2.\n\nBut let's confirm the action sequence.\n\nH=2, actions at t=15 and t=16.\n\na_{15} = U\n\na_{16} = S (stay, since we are at 9)\n\nWe could do a_{16} = U, but y=10 not possible, since y in [0,9], so U from 9 might not be allowed, or it would be clamped, but probably not necessary.\n\nThe dynamics: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y in [0,9], so if at 9 and U, it stays? Or invalid?\n\nThe equation says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=9 and U, y_{t+1} =10, not in [0,9], so probably not allowed, or it should be clamped to 9.\n\nBut to be safe, better to do S when at 9.\n\nSimilarly for D at 0.\n\nIn this case, at turn 16, y=9, so action S is fine.\n\nSo sequence: Turn 15: U, Turn 16: S\n\nBut in the answer, it should be for turns starting from t_1.\n\nNow, but the problem has many cars, and all freeways from 1 to 8 have cars, but for y=2 to y=7, the cars are similar, all have two cars with same numbers except y=1 and y=2 are different.\n\ny=1: cars (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6) — three cars.\n\ny=2: (60,25,right,36) — only one car.\n\ny=3 to y=8: each has (42,31,right,6) and (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nBut since we start at y=8 and go directly to y=9, we don't care about other rows.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut perhaps the player is at y=8, and needs to go to y=9, but maybe there is an obstacle or something, but no, only cars, and at x=0, no car at turn 15.\n\nAnother thought: at the moment of move, but the collision is per turn based on position.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating.\n\nSo minimal H=2 with actions U then S.\n\nBut H=2, reach at t_1 + H -1 =15+2-1=16.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster, but not possible.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 15: U Turn 16: S }\n\nBut let's write properly.\n\nt_1=15, so:\n\nTurn 15: a_{15} = U\n\nTurn 16: a_{16} = S\n\nIn the sequence, it should be for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1, which is 15 and 16 for H=2.\n\nYes.\n\nBut the action at 16 is S, which is fine.\n\nTo make it cleaner, since after reaching, we don't need to act, but the sequence must have H actions.\n\nPerhaps H could be 1, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: if we do nothing, but we are at 8, not 9.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n\nBut let me check if on y=8, at turn 15, with the cars, is x=0 occupied? No.\n\nPerhaps the cars are long, but spans are away from 0.\n\nFirst car [31,42], all x>30, far.\n\nSecond car [-35,-24], all x< -23, far negative.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: S }\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so for t_1=15.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for y=2, there is a car with speed 36, which is fast, but on y=2, not relevant.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nI think I'm good.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 15\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- At turn 15, the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\).\n- Cars on freeway 8 at turn 15:\n  - Car 1: Span = \\([31, 42]\\) (right-moving, speed 6)\n  - Car 2: Span = \\([-35, -24]\\) (right-moving, speed 6)\n- Position \\(x = 0\\) is not in either span at turn 15, so no collision occurs.\n- Action \\(U\\) (up) at turn 15 moves the player to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 16.\n- At turn 16, the player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway, so no cars are present and no collision can occur.\n- The position (0, 9) is reached at turn 16, which corresponds to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 15 + H - 1\\). Setting this equal to 16 gives \\(H = 2\\).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- With \\(H = 2\\), actions are required at turns 15 and 16.\n- At turn 15, action \\(U\\) moves the player from \\(y = 8\\) to \\(y = 9\\).\n- At turn 16, action \\(S\\) (stay) maintains the position at \\(y = 9\\), as the target has been reached and no further movement is needed.\n\n### Verification:\n- **Turn 15 (y=8)**: Player is on freeway 8. Car spans at turn 15: \\([31, 42]\\) and \\([-35, -24]\\). \\(x = 0\\) not in spans, no collision.\n- **Turn 16 (y=9)**: Not a freeway, no cars, no collision.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in minimal turns \\(H = 2\\) without collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: S }",
